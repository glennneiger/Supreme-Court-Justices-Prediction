mr.
hugh
r.
manes
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
constitutionality
of
the
federal
use
immunity
statute
title
18
sections
6002
and
6003.
the
question
presented
in
this
case,
whether
federal
use
immunity
as
conferred
by
section
6002
is
coextensive
with
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
this
case
arises
from
the
imprisonment
for
civil
contempt
of
the
petitioners,
both
of
them,
by
the
federal
district
court
or
the
central
district
of
california
for
refusing
to
answer
questions
put
to
them
by
the
--
before
the
grand
jury
for
violations
or
alleged
violations
of
the
selective
service
law.
the
petitioners
were
accorded
use
immunity
by
the
united
states
attorney
and
ordered
to
answer
by
the
united
states
district
court
pursuant
to
that
immunity
which
was
conferred
under
section
6002
and
they
declined
to
answer
the
questions
in
any
event
invoking
their
privilege
on
their
theory
that
the
immunity
offered
by
6002
was
incomplete.
petitioners
contend
here
that
only
transactional
immunity
will
satisfy
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
we
take
that
position
for
several
reasons.
first,
the
history
and
development
of
the
privilege
and
the
logic
compel
absolute
immunity
be
granted
and
nothing
less.
secondly,
we
argue
that
so
called
tainted
evidence,
rules
required
for
the
administration
and
control
and
supervision
of
the
use
in
these
statute
are
inadequate.
they
cannot
guarantee
the
absolute
immunity
which
the
fifth
amendment
demand
requires.
thirdly,
we
take
the
position
that
the
statutorial
language
of
6003
so
limits
the
court
power
as
to
prevent
a
fair
and
reasonable
application
of
use
immunity
and
in
particularly
prevent
adequate
court
supervision
of
the
use
of
that
particular
immunity.
finally
we
argue
that
use
immunity
conferred
by
6002
coupled
with
existing
statute
for
example
the
jenks
act
rule
16
and
other
provisions.
as
such
has
to
deprive
the
witness
of
due
process
and
abridge
his
right
guarantee
him
by
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendments
and
particularly
to
render
these
immunity
statutes
at
bar
unfair
as
against
the
subject
witness
who
may
become
an
accused
person.
before
i
proceed
with
that
argument,
i
would
like
to
point
out
something
about
this
particular
statute
that
we
are
dealing
with
which
is
in
response
to
questions
put
to
prior
counsel.
this
i
would
respectfully
submit,
is
use
immunity
statute
that
has
no
limitations
indeed
it
is
called
a
general
immunity
law.
it
is
not
limited
in
its
application
to
simply
multi-defendant
cases
nor
is
it
limited
in
any
way
to
any
particular
kind
of
offense.
it
permits
immunity
to
be
granted
and
the
witness
to
be
compelled
to
answer
and
virtually,
most
if
not
all
offenses.
and
certainly
as
again,
whether
the
person
is
an
individual
and
charged
or
suspected
of
only
an
individual
crime
as
well
as
of
course,
the
multiple
defendant
offense
in
this
kind
of
situation.
and
we
submit
that
where
you
have
a
statute
that
is
as
broad
as
the
statute
at
bar
from
a
prosecution
point
of
view
if
it
is
there,
it
is
going
to
be
used.
and
it
is
limited
in
its
use.
it
has
to
be
approved
by
somebody
in
washington
at
least
besides
the
assistant
attorney
general
level
or
it
has
to
be
ascertained.
it
has
to
be
the
authority
for
giving,
immunity
must
be
approved
by
the
attorney
general
or
its
authorized
representative,
but
i
would
submit
your
honor
that
under
section
6002
has
to
be
as
–
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
yes
sir.
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
well,
your
honor
i
would
assume
so
but
i
am
not
addressing
myself
to
the
question
of
scope
as--
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
i
would
assume
your
honor
that
that
would
be
true
in
both
cases
but
i
could
not
represent
as
to
its
effect
with
regard
to
the
house
or
congress
might
certainly
confirm
that
that
would
be
true
as
regards
immunity
for
a
grand
jury.
and
i
would
add
to
that
if
the
court
please,
that
the
representations
maybe
made
through
the
court
as
mere
conclusions
as
they
were
below
with
regard
not
only
to
the
authority.
and
i
would
further
point
out
that
all
that
the
united
states
attorney
may
show
is
a
conclusionary
statement
that
it
is
in
the
public
interest
for
the
government
to
grant
immunity
and
to
inquire
also
really
of
the
witness.
he
may
not
--
he
is
not
required
to
show
in
the
court
cannot
demand
that
he
show
reasonable
cause
for
intruding
on
the
privacy,
i
think
this
is
a
very
important
thing
that
we
are
talking
about
a
secret
proceedings
such
as
the
grand
jury
as
in
this
case.
in
any
event,
what
i
wanted
to
--
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
all
the
records
shows
your
honor
and
that
will
appear
in
the
appendix
at
pages
54
and
60
of
the
appendix,
actually
54
through
60.
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
it
simply
shows
that
the
united
states
attorney
represented,
that
there
was
a
public
interest
in
having
the
petitioners
appear
before
the
grand
jury
with
use
of
immunity.
that
they
would
invoke
the
fifth
or
indeed
had
done
so
in
the
case
of
kastigar
and
that
the
privilege
was
made
with
good
faith
with
the
approval
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
that
is
all
the
showing
that
was
required
and
i
want
to
reiterate
that
the
showing
that
is
made
there
is
without
any
detail
as
to
in
what
respect
there
is
a
reasonable
cause,
it
is
just
a
conclusionary
statement.
now,
i
wanted
to
urge
upon
this
court
why
we
take,
why
it
is
important
to
us
at
least
that
transaction
immunity
be
regard
as
the
very
limit
for
the
fifth
amendment
for
the
grant
of
any
kind
of
immunity
and
i
would
urge
upon
this
court
that
it
is
the
government
that
wants
immunity.
when
we
talk
you
know,
of
giving
immunity
back,
i
would
urge
this
court
to
consider
that
it
is
the
government
that
is
seeking
to
force
a
person
to
testify
against
himself.
and
they
are
seeking
that
immunity,
they
are
seeking
that
testimony
to
compel
him
to
testify
against
himself
because
they
want
some
information
and
he
is
not
convenient
for
doing
that.
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
mr.
chief
justice,
state
counsel,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
has
been
said
and
argued
that---
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
the
which
case
please?
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
ullmann?
well
i
would—
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
i
would
like
that
but
i
try
to
be
realistic
your
honor
and
assume
that
is
--
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
it
does
and
because
we
believe
that
the
court
has
never
answered
the
question
as
to
whether
the
fifth
amendment
and
its
history
does
not
enjoin
compulsion
and
on
that
pieces
your
honor.
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
yes
your
honor,
i
do.
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
i
know
that
your
honor
and
so
i
am
taking
it
from
there.
but
if
the
court
please,
i
--
there
is
an
argument
that
is
being
made
that
the
fifth
amendment
protects
only
use
of
compelled
testimony,
and
i
want
to
address
myself
to
that
just
for
a
moment
and
point
out
that
the
fifth
amendment
has
been
held
by
this
court
in
ullmann
not
to
be
interpreted
in
a
hostile
or
negative
spirit,
and
that
it
is
to
be
construed
liberally
to
effectuate
its
intent
and
purposes
and
that
was
the
holding
of
course
in
spivak
versus
kline
(ph)
as
well
as
many
other
cases.
and
so
i
would
note
that
there
is
not
just
one
purpose
as
this
court
observed
in
murphy
at
page
55
and
as
observed
as
long
ago
as
boyd
versus
united
states,
the
fifth
amendment
has
many
purposes
that
had
to
be
considered
when
you
are
evaluating
the
question
of
whether
use
immunity
is
efficient.
for
one
thing,
the
fifth
amendment
was
designed
and
came
in
to
our
constitution
to
prevent
disclosures
by
torture
and
well,
i
submit
that
maybe
some
may
feel
that
that
is
kind
of
remote
now,
we
are
in
a
modern
age.
i
would
remind
this
court
that
it
was
only
30
years
ago
when
this
court
was
forced
to
deal
with
the
problems
of
third
degree
in
brown
versus
mississippi,
chambers
versus
florida
and
a
whole
series
of
cases
and
only
a
few
years
ago
when
this
court
had
a
hold
miranda
that
it
was
necessary
for
an
accused
to
be
given
a
warning
about
the
effect
of
this
testimony.
so
we
are
concerned
with
the
scope
of
that
protection
as
applied
to
coercion.
but
in
addition
to
that,
the
court
please
i
would
submit
that
the
fifth
amendment
also
has
policy
consideration
which
is
long
been
the
concern
of
this
court,
that
is
the
distrust
that
we
have
of
coerced
testimony,
the
distrust
we
have
of
it.
i
would
submit
that
in
brown
versus
united
states
which
was
decided
only
a
year
after
walker
versus
brown,
this
court
made
a
very
important
observation.
it
recognized
at
page
547
168
u.s.,
the
human
mind
under
the
pressure
of
calamity
is
easily
seduced
and
is
liable
and
the
alarm
of
danger
to
acknowledge
indiscriminately,
a
falsehood
or
a
truth
as
different
agitations
may
prevail.
and
why
i
think
that
particular
quotation
is
apt
here
is
because
the
petitioners
here
are
put
in
the
position
of
avoiding
jail
not
simply
because
they
have
been
granted
immunity
or
be
held
in
contempt,
but
that
they
are
compelled
to
avoid
jail
by
giving
information
which
they
think
the
government
may
want
to
hear
and
ought
to
avoid
prosecution.
now,
that
is
a
tendency,
i
would
respectfully
submit,
that
is
inherent
in
any
use
immunity
statute
and
certainly
in
the
one
involved.
but
there
is
another
policy
consideration
here
too
and
the
court
please,
and
that
is
that
it
is
to
avoid
not
simply
a
trilemma
but
a
quatrolemma
if
the
court
please
of
self
accusation,
perjury
and
contempt
and
the
possibility
of
prosecution.
i
would
submit
that
brown
versus
walker
deals
with
that
dilemma
or
that
quatrolemma
as
i
prefer
to
call
it.
very
succinctly
and
poignantly
and
remember
this
is
in
1896
when
the
court
there
is
talking
about
the
policies
which
gave
rise
to
the
fifth
amendment
and
it
observed
that
if
an
accused
person
be
asked
to
explain
his
apparent
connection
with
the
crime
under
investigation,
the
ease
with
which
the
question
has
put
to
him
may
assume
an
inquisitorial
character,
the
temptation
to
press
the
witness
unduly
to
(inaudible)
him,
if
he
be
timid
or
reluctant,
to
push
him
into
a
corner
and
to
entrap
him.
to
entrap
him
into
fatal
contradictions
which
is
so
painfully
evident
in
many
of
the
early
state
trials
made
the
systems
so
audios
as
to
give
rise
to
a
demand
for
its
total
abolition.
in
the
context
of
this
case,
i
would
respectfully
submit
in
response
to
a
question
that
was
posed
to
counsel
this
morning.
that
the
accused
here
does
not
hold
exclusively
the
keys
to
his
jail
door.
on
the
contrary,
it
is
like
anyone
who
has
money
and
has
a
safety
deposit
box,
he
shares
that
with
the
bank
and
so
here,
the
accused
shares
the
keys
with
the
government.
for
well
it
is
true
that
he
can
talk
and
thus
open
the
door
of
contempt
that
has
confined
him
in
contempt.
the
government
holds
the
key
as
to
whether
his
talking
may
lead
to
a
desire
to
prosecute
him
and
therefore
i
submit
that
when
we
are
talking
about
quatrolemmal,
we
are
not
talking
about
the
policy
and
the
privilege,
we
have
to
consider
this
possibility
as
well.
we
have
to
consider
what
was
said
by
this
court
in
another
cases.
the
choice
here
that
the
accused
has
between
the
rock
and
whirlpool
multiplied.
and
there
is
another
consideration
to
court
please
and
that
is
the
basic
respect
which
this
society
has
for
the
inviolability
of
the
person
and
his
privacy
as
the
court
noted.
in
mallory
versus
hogan
as
it
noted.
in
miranda
versus
arizona
and
it
is
certainly
noted
long
ago
in
the
boyd
case
when
it
observed
that
any
compulsory
discovery
by
extorting
the
parties
oath
or
compelling
the
production
of
his
private
books
and
papers
to
convict
him
of
a
crime
or
deport
that
his
poverty
certainly
is
a
principle
that
merges
into
the
fourth
and
the
fifth
amendment.
and
another
point,
we
have
here
in
our
society
a
preference
for
the
prosecutorial
system,
for
the
accusatorial
system,
which
places
the
burden
entirely
on
the
government,
and
not
for
the
inquisitorial
process,
which
i
would
respectfully
submit
certainly
in
the
context
of
this
case.
it
takes
place
in
the
grand
jury
room
where
the
accused
is
without
a
lawyer.
where
he
has
no
protection
whatsoever
but
where
he
is
faced
with
a
lawyer.
and
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
given
the
secrecy
which
attends
all
grand
jury
proceedings
and
the
secrecy
which
prevails
thereafter
as
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
made
quite
apparent
in
many
cases,
that
it
will
be
extremely,
the
accused
will
be
extremely
hard
put
not
to
feel
a
sense
of
entrapment
by
the
circumstances
which
attempt
the
use
immunity
situation.
but
there
is
one
additional
consideration
which
i
think
underscores
the
fifth
amendment
as
i
read
the
cases
of
this
court
and
that
is
the
notion
of
a
sense
of
fair
play
which
requires
the
government
to
let
the
individual
alone
unless
it
has
reasonable
cause
to
justify
intruding
upon
him.
now,
as
i
pointed
out
earlier
in
my
comments,
this
statute
gives
the
accused
no
opportunity
whatsoever
nor
indeed
the
court
to
inquire
whether
there
was
reasonable
cause
to
peruse
his
privacy
or
indeed
his
defenses
and
allows
the
government
to
ransack
his
defenses
as
the
accused
is
not
permitted
to
do
with
respect
to
government
files.
now,
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
there
is
other
considerations.
that
for
example
the
protection
of
the
innocent
even
though
some
guilty
may
benefit
incidentally,
that
is
a
choice.
that
is
a
choice
which
government
makes
in
the
context
list
of
this
kind
of
statute
and
it
is
a
choice
which
is
made
upon
the
circumstance
that
if
the
accused
has
something
that
it
wants
to
have
badly,
then
the
government
should
be
put
to
the
choice
as
it
was
put
to
the
choice
in
rosairo,
as
it
was
put
to
the
choice
in
andolshek
and
coplin
and
a
number
of
other
cases,
it
has
got
to
choose.
if
it
wants
to
have
information,
then
it
will
have
the
information
that
avoid
prosecution.
but
if
it
wants
to
prosecute,
then
prosecute
and
let
the
privilege
remain
the
sanctuary
of
the
individual
who
is
presumed
to
be
innocent.
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
no
sir,
i
mean,
i
am
not
aware
of
any
empirical
data
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
suspect
one
reason
maybe
because
use
immunity
is
still
somewhat
new,
this
statute
was
only
passed
last
fall.
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
i
am
not
aware
of
any
mr.
chief
justice
but
i
would
say
that
there
are
some
cases
which
show
the
difficulties
that
courts
have
had
even
with
transactional
immunity
although
the
difficulties
are
not
going
to
compound
with
use
immunity
but
i
do
not
hold
any
empirical
data
in
the
court.
finally,
i
want
to
submit
one
other
additional
consideration
to
this
court
for
policy
consideration,
and
that
is
the
respect
for
law
and
the
orderly
process
of
administration
that
comes
with
the
idea
that
a
man
cannot
be
compelled
to
accuse
himself
and
which
will
be
undermined
when
there
is
even
the
suspicion
that
an
accused
has
been
given,
that
there
maybe
some
evidence
that
is
being
used
to
taint
his
trial
that
has
come
from
his
own
mouth.
i
remember
reading
somewhere,
i
think
it
was
in
moore
versus
dempsey
where
mr.
justice
holmes
once
said
that
it
is
not
only
important
to
give
justice
or
to
do
justice
but
to
give
the
appearance
of
justice
and
i
think
that
this
is
an
important
consideration.
now,
i
am
not
going
to
here
debate,
the
question
whether
counselman
ought
to
is
dicta
it
is
not
--
i
take
the
position
it
is
not
dicta
but
obviously
this
court
is
concerned
to
reevaluate
the
problem
that
the
counselman
addressed
itself
too.
and
i
would
however
point
out
to
this
court
that
there
have
been
a
--
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
of
the
use
immunity
statute
here,
that
has
not
been
true
in
a
seventh
circuit,
that
has
not
been
true
in
the
third
circuit,

the
satina
case,
satina
versus
elias
being
in
the
449
f
2,
page
40
and
more
recently
just
recently,
the
eighth
circuit
also
took
the
view
that
the
ninth
circuit
was
an
error
and
viewed,
viewed
the
underlying
policy
considerations
of
counselmen
as
prevailing
and
i
refer
here
to
united
states
versus
mcdaniel
449
f
2
832
at
page
838.
that
case
incidentally
is
kind
of
interesting
because
it
addresses
itself
to
one
of
the
questions
that
was
put
to
counsel
early
this
morning.
when
counsel
was
asked
about
weather
he
was
overzealous,
whether
a
prosecutor
was
going
to
be
overzealous.
in
that
particular
case,
i
would
point
out
that
counsel
there
was
the
federal
prosecutor
who
because
he
was
informed
by
his
administrative
agencies
that
there
was
a
suspicion
that
a
bank
president
was
defalcating
and
embezzling
monies.
turn
the
matter
over
to
a
state
to
the
state
of
north
or
south
dakota
and
the
state
then
held
an
immunity
grand
jury
proceeding,
on
the
ground
of
immunity
and
then
at
the
request
of
the
united
states
attorney,
turned
that
transcript
over
to
the
united
states
attorney
for
prosecution
and
indictment
followed.
i
would
say
that
the
court
there
held,
that
that
was
prime
facie
evidence
of
the
use
of
fruits
but
i
would
also
point
out
that
it
demonstrates
as
does
of
course,
the
berger
in
295
u.s.
and
number
of
other
cases
demonstrates
that
prosecutors
can
be
at
times
overzealous
and
particularly
when
conferred
with
such
extensive
power
as
appears
to
be
the
case
here.
but
when
i
first
spoke,
i
suggested
that
there
were
other
compelling
reasons
why
i
believe
use
immunity
should
not
prevail
and
one
of
the
most
important
of
those
reasons
of
course
is
that
it
is
inadequate,
that
the
rules
that
are
designed
to
enforce
and
administer
the
use
immunity
concept
are
just
simply
unable
to
effectively
displace
the
fifth
amendment.
in
short,
what
i
content,
what
we
contented
in
our
briefs
is
that
that
the
rules
that
are
designed
to
protect
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendment
in
search
and
seizure
cases
and
in
the
forced
confession
case
are
simply
not
adequate
to
protect
or
to
at
least
define
the
limits
of
the
fifth
amendment.
in
short,
what
is
happening
here,
what
is
being
argued
for
here
is
the
use
of
essentially
procedural
rules
to
define
the
substantive
rights
of
a
witness
and
i
submit
that
that
cannot
be
done
without
creating
some
terrible
problems
for
an
accused
who
is
questioning
whether
the
evidence
used
against
him
in
a
subsequent
prosecution
had
this
tainted.
let
me
suggest
some
concrete
examples
of
what
i
am
referring
to
in
this
concept.
first
of
all,
california,
the
california
supreme
court
decided
in
people
versus
dickson
57
cal
2
at
page
415,
that
was
a
forced
confession
case
and
it
held
there
that
the
fruits
of
a
forced
confession
were
not
admissible
but
it
went
on
to
hold
that
the
fruits
of
a
forced
confession
may
not
be
admissible
but
that
if
the
evidence
was
discoverable,
was
discoverable
by
law
enforcement
that
therefore
that
under
those
circumstances
there
was
an
attenuation
and
that
evidence
would
be
admissible.
and
that
same
theory
that
was
used
in
the
dickson
case
and
in
subsequent
california
supreme
court
cases,
and
the
case
of
like
nature
has
also
been
applied
by
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
in
wayne
versus
united
states
318
federal
second
and
it
was
applied
most
recently
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
a
case,
united
states
versus
jackson
448
federal
second
at
page
970
where
the
court
and
i
am
quoting
said
“it
would
be
speculative
to
conclude
that
but
for
such
information,
the
police
would
not
have
identified
defendants
or
learned
their
place
of
residence.”
i
would
like
to
reserve
some
time
for
reply,
thank
you.
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
few
remarks
on
my
rebuttal.
first
i
want
to
state
that
the
case
i
was
referring
to
the
california
supreme
court
case,
people
versus
dickson,
57
cal
second
415
and
there
are
several
other
cases
that
i
have
referred
to
in
my
opening
brief
of
the
same
elk
at
page
40
of
our
opening
brief.
second
point,
i
want
to
make
and
demonstrate
through
this
case
is
that
although
the
government
here
says
we
would
give,
you
know
---
we
would
only
rely
upon
the
rule
that
the
government
must
show
that
it
has
not
discovered
rather
than
use
the
discoverable
rule.
i
would
point
out
to
this
court
that
we
are
talking
about
the
rules
as
they
now
exist
and
are
followed
in
the
various
circuits
and
in
the
states,
and
therefore,
if
the
court
is
of
a
mind
to
be
thinking
in
terms
of
use
immunity,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
very
minimum
that
is
required
at
this
point
is
to
straighten
out
the
rules
first
before
use
immunity
be
considered
as
within
the
scope
of
the
fifth
amendment.
the
other
point,
i
want
to
make
is
that
although
the
government
here
talks
about
having
ample
evidence
before,--
i
will
cite
that
example
above,
that
accused
that
has
ample
evidence
before
he
is
given
immunity,
i
would
say
to
the
government,
why
do
they
not
get
a
conviction,
then
when
they
have
got
a
conviction
they
can
get
the
testimony
without
conferring
immunity
because
of
course,
they
have
no
reason
for
the
rule
for
the
privilege
falls
but
i
cannot
see
as
mr.
justice
stewart
points
out.
i
cannot
see
giving
--
we
already
have
use
immunity.
i
mean,
no
court
is
going
to
allow
compelled
testimony
to
come
in,
we
have
that.
and
then
the
very
minimum,
the
government
must
give
us
something
more.
now,
the
other
point
i
want
to
make
is
the
heavy
burden
that
the
government
talks
about
is
a
losery,
it
is
losery
because
although
the
government
can
seize
that
any
testimony
that
aids
the
government
in
the
prosecution
would
fall
without
the
rule,
i
would
point
out
that
there
are
some
very
compelling
examples
to
show
that
the
government
can
and
will
benefit.
for
example,
when
use
immunity
is
given
to
a
witness,
he
will
be
in
a
grand
jury
proceeding,
he
will
be
asked
some
other
things
about
his
witnesses.
he
will
giving
information.
now,
the
prosecutor
who
examines
him
could
very
well
be
as
the
case
may
turn
out,
the
prosecutor
would
prosecute
him
ultimately
and
will
have
the
benefit
certainly
of
information
on
which
to
draw
his
cross
examination.
but
even
more
compelling
in
the
fact
that
in
this
particular
context
we
are
dealing
with
a
series
of
problems
and
rules
that
as
that
i
pointed
out
exist
and
there
is
no
way
to
escape
from
them,
we
have
rules
for
example
that
come
from
wang
san
and
adonis
which
talk
about
well
a
little
bit
of
evidence
if
it
is
tainted
is
alright,
if
it
is
attenuated.
now,
if
you
are
going
to
talk
about
defining
what
are
the
fifth
amendment
privileges?
is
whether
use
immunity
is
as
broad
as
the
fifth
amendment
privilege,
the
fifth
amendment
says
nothing
about
allowing
a
little
bit
of
tainted
evidence
to
be
compelled
and
used
against
the
accused.
when
we
are
talking
here
about
the
developing
rules,
we
have
our
chaplin
versus
united
states
saying
that
the
announcing
the
harmless
error
rule.
does
that
mean
that
if
a
court
ultimately
concludes
that
well,
a
tainted
evidence
perhaps
was
used
from
the
mouth
of
the
accused
but
after
all
it
is
harmless
in
terms
of
the
total
context
of
the
case,
have
we
not
then
abridged
the
rule?
and
these
are
the
rules
we
respectfully
submit
that
are
used
to
define
the
use
immunity
and
use
immunity
therefore
comes
to
use
something
like
“humpty
dumpy,”
once
the
egg
is
broken,
it
can
never
be
put
together
again
the
same
way.
thank
you.
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
constitutionality
of
the
federal
use
immunity
statute
title
18
sections
6002
and
6003.
the
question
presented
in
this
case,
whether
federal
use
immunity
as
conferred
by
section
6002
is
coextensive
with
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
this
case
arises
from
the
imprisonment
for
civil
contempt
of
the
petitioners,
both
of
them,
by
the
federal
district
court
or
the
central
district
of
california
for
refusing
to
answer
questions
put
to
them
by
the
--
before
the
grand
jury
for
violations
or
alleged
violations
of
the
selective
service
law.
the
petitioners
were
accorded
use
immunity
by
the
united
states
attorney
and
ordered
to
answer
by
the
united
states
district
court
pursuant
to
that
immunity
which
was
conferred
under
section
6002
and
they
declined
to
answer
the
questions
in
any
event
invoking
their
privilege
on
their
theory
that
the
immunity
offered
by
6002
was
incomplete.
petitioners
contend
here
that
only
transactional
immunity
will
satisfy
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
we
take
that
position
for
several
reasons.
first,
the
history
and
development
of
the
privilege
and
the
logic
compel
absolute
immunity
be
granted
and
nothing
less.
secondly,
we
argue
that
so
called
tainted
evidence,
rules
required
for
the
administration
and
control
and
supervision
of
the
use
in
these
statute
are
inadequate.
they
cannot
guarantee
the
absolute
immunity
which
the
fifth
amendment
demand
requires.
thirdly,
we
take
the
position
that
the
statutorial
language
of
6003
so
limits
the
court
power
as
to
prevent
a
fair
and
reasonable
application
of
use
immunity
and
in
particularly
prevent
adequate
court
supervision
of
the
use
of
that
particular
immunity.
finally
we
argue
that
use
immunity
conferred
by
6002
coupled
with
existing
statute
for
example
the
jenks
act
rule
16
and
other
provisions.
as
such
has
to
deprive
the
witness
of
due
process
and
abridge
his
right
guarantee
him
by
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendments
and
particularly
to
render
these
immunity
statutes
at
bar
unfair
as
against
the
subject
witness
who
may
become
an
accused
person.
before
i
proceed
with
that
argument,
i
would
like
to
point
out
something
about
this
particular
statute
that
we
are
dealing
with
which
is
in
response
to
questions
put
to
prior
counsel.
this
i
would
respectfully
submit,
is
use
immunity
statute
that
has
no
limitations
indeed
it
is
called
a
general
immunity
law.
it
is
not
limited
in
its
application
to
simply
multi-defendant
cases
nor
is
it
limited
in
any
way
to
any
particular
kind
of
offense.
it
permits
immunity
to
be
granted
and
the
witness
to
be
compelled
to
answer
and
virtually,
most
if
not
all
offenses.
and
certainly
as
again,
whether
the
person
is
an
individual
and
charged
or
suspected
of
only
an
individual
crime
as
well
as
of
course,
the
multiple
defendant
offense
in
this
kind
of
situation.
and
we
submit
that
where
you
have
a
statute
that
is
as
broad
as
the
statute
at
bar
from
a
prosecution
point
of
view
if
it
is
there,
it
is
going
to
be
used.
and
it
is
limited
in
its
use.
it
has
to
be
approved
by
somebody
in
washington
at
least
besides
the
assistant
attorney
general
level
or
it
has
to
be
ascertained.
it
has
to
be
the
authority
for
giving,
immunity
must
be
approved
by
the
attorney
general
or
its
authorized
representative,
but
i
would
submit
your
honor
that
under
section
6002
has
to
be
as
–
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
yes
sir.
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
well,
your
honor
i
would
assume
so
but
i
am
not
addressing
myself
to
the
question
of
scope
as--
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
i
would
assume
your
honor
that
that
would
be
true
in
both
cases
but
i
could
not
represent
as
to
its
effect
with
regard
to
the
house
or
congress
might
certainly
confirm
that
that
would
be
true
as
regards
immunity
for
a
grand
jury.
and
i
would
add
to
that
if
the
court
please,
that
the
representations
maybe
made
through
the
court
as
mere
conclusions
as
they
were
below
with
regard
not
only
to
the
authority.
and
i
would
further
point
out
that
all
that
the
united
states
attorney
may
show
is
a
conclusionary
statement
that
it
is
in
the
public
interest
for
the
government
to
grant
immunity
and
to
inquire
also
really
of
the
witness.
he
may
not
--
he
is
not
required
to
show
in
the
court
cannot
demand
that
he
show
reasonable
cause
for
intruding
on
the
privacy,
i
think
this
is
a
very
important
thing
that
we
are
talking
about
a
secret
proceedings
such
as
the
grand
jury
as
in
this
case.
in
any
event,
what
i
wanted
to
--
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
all
the
records
shows
your
honor
and
that
will
appear
in
the
appendix
at
pages
54
and
60
of
the
appendix,
actually
54
through
60.
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
it
simply
shows
that
the
united
states
attorney
represented,
that
there
was
a
public
interest
in
having
the
petitioners
appear
before
the
grand
jury
with
use
of
immunity.
that
they
would
invoke
the
fifth
or
indeed
had
done
so
in
the
case
of
kastigar
and
that
the
privilege
was
made
with
good
faith
with
the
approval
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
that
is
all
the
showing
that
was
required
and
i
want
to
reiterate
that
the
showing
that
is
made
there
is
without
any
detail
as
to
in
what
respect
there
is
a
reasonable
cause,
it
is
just
a
conclusionary
statement.
now,
i
wanted
to
urge
upon
this
court
why
we
take,
why
it
is
important
to
us
at
least
that
transaction
immunity
be
regard
as
the
very
limit
for
the
fifth
amendment
for
the
grant
of
any
kind
of
immunity
and
i
would
urge
upon
this
court
that
it
is
the
government
that
wants
immunity.
when
we
talk
you
know,
of
giving
immunity
back,
i
would
urge
this
court
to
consider
that
it
is
the
government
that
is
seeking
to
force
a
person
to
testify
against
himself.
and
they
are
seeking
that
immunity,
they
are
seeking
that
testimony
to
compel
him
to
testify
against
himself
because
they
want
some
information
and
he
is
not
convenient
for
doing
that.
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
mr.
chief
justice,
state
counsel,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
has
been
said
and
argued
that---
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
the
which
case
please?
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
ullmann?
well
i
would—
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
i
would
like
that
but
i
try
to
be
realistic
your
honor
and
assume
that
is
--
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
it
does
and
because
we
believe
that
the
court
has
never
answered
the
question
as
to
whether
the
fifth
amendment
and
its
history
does
not
enjoin
compulsion
and
on
that
pieces
your
honor.
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
yes
your
honor,
i
do.
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
i
know
that
your
honor
and
so
i
am
taking
it
from
there.
but
if
the
court
please,
i
--
there
is
an
argument
that
is
being
made
that
the
fifth
amendment
protects
only
use
of
compelled
testimony,
and
i
want
to
address
myself
to
that
just
for
a
moment
and
point
out
that
the
fifth
amendment
has
been
held
by
this
court
in
ullmann
not
to
be
interpreted
in
a
hostile
or
negative
spirit,
and
that
it
is
to
be
construed
liberally
to
effectuate
its
intent
and
purposes
and
that
was
the
holding
of
course
in
spivak
versus
kline
(ph)
as
well
as
many
other
cases.
and
so
i
would
note
that
there
is
not
just
one
purpose
as
this
court
observed
in
murphy
at
page
55
and
as
observed
as
long
ago
as
boyd
versus
united
states,
the
fifth
amendment
has
many
purposes
that
had
to
be
considered
when
you
are
evaluating
the
question
of
whether
use
immunity
is
efficient.
for
one
thing,
the
fifth
amendment
was
designed
and
came
in
to
our
constitution
to
prevent
disclosures
by
torture
and
well,
i
submit
that
maybe
some
may
feel
that
that
is
kind
of
remote
now,
we
are
in
a
modern
age.
i
would
remind
this
court
that
it
was
only
30
years
ago
when
this
court
was
forced
to
deal
with
the
problems
of
third
degree
in
brown
versus
mississippi,
chambers
versus
florida
and
a
whole
series
of
cases
and
only
a
few
years
ago
when
this
court
had
a
hold
miranda
that
it
was
necessary
for
an
accused
to
be
given
a
warning
about
the
effect
of
this
testimony.
so
we
are
concerned
with
the
scope
of
that
protection
as
applied
to
coercion.
but
in
addition
to
that,
the
court
please
i
would
submit
that
the
fifth
amendment
also
has
policy
consideration
which
is
long
been
the
concern
of
this
court,
that
is
the
distrust
that
we
have
of
coerced
testimony,
the
distrust
we
have
of
it.
i
would
submit
that
in
brown
versus
united
states
which
was
decided
only
a
year
after
walker
versus
brown,
this
court
made
a
very
important
observation.
it
recognized
at
page
547
168
u.s.,
the
human
mind
under
the
pressure
of
calamity
is
easily
seduced
and
is
liable
and
the
alarm
of
danger
to
acknowledge
indiscriminately,
a
falsehood
or
a
truth
as
different
agitations
may
prevail.
and
why
i
think
that
particular
quotation
is
apt
here
is
because
the
petitioners
here
are
put
in
the
position
of
avoiding
jail
not
simply
because
they
have
been
granted
immunity
or
be
held
in
contempt,
but
that
they
are
compelled
to
avoid
jail
by
giving
information
which
they
think
the
government
may
want
to
hear
and
ought
to
avoid
prosecution.
now,
that
is
a
tendency,
i
would
respectfully
submit,
that
is
inherent
in
any
use
immunity
statute
and
certainly
in
the
one
involved.
but
there
is
another
policy
consideration
here
too
and
the
court
please,
and
that
is
that
it
is
to
avoid
not
simply
a
trilemma
but
a
quatrolemma
if
the
court
please
of
self
accusation,
perjury
and
contempt
and
the
possibility
of
prosecution.
i
would
submit
that
brown
versus
walker
deals
with
that
dilemma
or
that
quatrolemma
as
i
prefer
to
call
it.
very
succinctly
and
poignantly
and
remember
this
is
in
1896
when
the
court
there
is
talking
about
the
policies
which
gave
rise
to
the
fifth
amendment
and
it
observed
that
if
an
accused
person
be
asked
to
explain
his
apparent
connection
with
the
crime
under
investigation,
the
ease
with
which
the
question
has
put
to
him
may
assume
an
inquisitorial
character,
the
temptation
to
press
the
witness
unduly
to
(inaudible)
him,
if
he
be
timid
or
reluctant,
to
push
him
into
a
corner
and
to
entrap
him.
to
entrap
him
into
fatal
contradictions
which
is
so
painfully
evident
in
many
of
the
early
state
trials
made
the
systems
so
audios
as
to
give
rise
to
a
demand
for
its
total
abolition.
in
the
context
of
this
case,
i
would
respectfully
submit
in
response
to
a
question
that
was
posed
to
counsel
this
morning.
that
the
accused
here
does
not
hold
exclusively
the
keys
to
his
jail
door.
on
the
contrary,
it
is
like
anyone
who
has
money
and
has
a
safety
deposit
box,
he
shares
that
with
the
bank
and
so
here,
the
accused
shares
the
keys
with
the
government.
for
well
it
is
true
that
he
can
talk
and
thus
open
the
door
of
contempt
that
has
confined
him
in
contempt.
the
government
holds
the
key
as
to
whether
his
talking
may
lead
to
a
desire
to
prosecute
him
and
therefore
i
submit
that
when
we
are
talking
about
quatrolemmal,
we
are
not
talking
about
the
policy
and
the
privilege,
we
have
to
consider
this
possibility
as
well.
we
have
to
consider
what
was
said
by
this
court
in
another
cases.
the
choice
here
that
the
accused
has
between
the
rock
and
whirlpool
multiplied.
and
there
is
another
consideration
to
court
please
and
that
is
the
basic
respect
which
this
society
has
for
the
inviolability
of
the
person
and
his
privacy
as
the
court
noted.
in
mallory
versus
hogan
as
it
noted.
in
miranda
versus
arizona
and
it
is
certainly
noted
long
ago
in
the
boyd
case
when
it
observed
that
any
compulsory
discovery
by
extorting
the
parties
oath
or
compelling
the
production
of
his
private
books
and
papers
to
convict
him
of
a
crime
or
deport
that
his
poverty
certainly
is
a
principle
that
merges
into
the
fourth
and
the
fifth
amendment.
and
another
point,
we
have
here
in
our
society
a
preference
for
the
prosecutorial
system,
for
the
accusatorial
system,
which
places
the
burden
entirely
on
the
government,
and
not
for
the
inquisitorial
process,
which
i
would
respectfully
submit
certainly
in
the
context
of
this
case.
it
takes
place
in
the
grand
jury
room
where
the
accused
is
without
a
lawyer.
where
he
has
no
protection
whatsoever
but
where
he
is
faced
with
a
lawyer.
and
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
given
the
secrecy
which
attends
all
grand
jury
proceedings
and
the
secrecy
which
prevails
thereafter
as
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
made
quite
apparent
in
many
cases,
that
it
will
be
extremely,
the
accused
will
be
extremely
hard
put
not
to
feel
a
sense
of
entrapment
by
the
circumstances
which
attempt
the
use
immunity
situation.
but
there
is
one
additional
consideration
which
i
think
underscores
the
fifth
amendment
as
i
read
the
cases
of
this
court
and
that
is
the
notion
of
a
sense
of
fair
play
which
requires
the
government
to
let
the
individual
alone
unless
it
has
reasonable
cause
to
justify
intruding
upon
him.
now,
as
i
pointed
out
earlier
in
my
comments,
this
statute
gives
the
accused
no
opportunity
whatsoever
nor
indeed
the
court
to
inquire
whether
there
was
reasonable
cause
to
peruse
his
privacy
or
indeed
his
defenses
and
allows
the
government
to
ransack
his
defenses
as
the
accused
is
not
permitted
to
do
with
respect
to
government
files.
now,
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
there
is
other
considerations.
that
for
example
the
protection
of
the
innocent
even
though
some
guilty
may
benefit
incidentally,
that
is
a
choice.
that
is
a
choice
which
government
makes
in
the
context
list
of
this
kind
of
statute
and
it
is
a
choice
which
is
made
upon
the
circumstance
that
if
the
accused
has
something
that
it
wants
to
have
badly,
then
the
government
should
be
put
to
the
choice
as
it
was
put
to
the
choice
in
rosairo,
as
it
was
put
to
the
choice
in
andolshek
and
coplin
and
a
number
of
other
cases,
it
has
got
to
choose.
if
it
wants
to
have
information,
then
it
will
have
the
information
that
avoid
prosecution.
but
if
it
wants
to
prosecute,
then
prosecute
and
let
the
privilege
remain
the
sanctuary
of
the
individual
who
is
presumed
to
be
innocent.
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
no
sir,
i
mean,
i
am
not
aware
of
any
empirical
data
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
suspect
one
reason
maybe
because
use
immunity
is
still
somewhat
new,
this
statute
was
only
passed
last
fall.
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
i
am
not
aware
of
any
mr.
chief
justice
but
i
would
say
that
there
are
some
cases
which
show
the
difficulties
that
courts
have
had
even
with
transactional
immunity
although
the
difficulties
are
not
going
to
compound
with
use
immunity
but
i
do
not
hold
any
empirical
data
in
the
court.
finally,
i
want
to
submit
one
other
additional
consideration
to
this
court
for
policy
consideration,
and
that
is
the
respect
for
law
and
the
orderly
process
of
administration
that
comes
with
the
idea
that
a
man
cannot
be
compelled
to
accuse
himself
and
which
will
be
undermined
when
there
is
even
the
suspicion
that
an
accused
has
been
given,
that
there
maybe
some
evidence
that
is
being
used
to
taint
his
trial
that
has
come
from
his
own
mouth.
i
remember
reading
somewhere,
i
think
it
was
in
moore
versus
dempsey
where
mr.
justice
holmes
once
said
that
it
is
not
only
important
to
give
justice
or
to
do
justice
but
to
give
the
appearance
of
justice
and
i
think
that
this
is
an
important
consideration.
now,
i
am
not
going
to
here
debate,
the
question
whether
counselman
ought
to
is
dicta
it
is
not
--
i
take
the
position
it
is
not
dicta
but
obviously
this
court
is
concerned
to
reevaluate
the
problem
that
the
counselman
addressed
itself
too.
and
i
would
however
point
out
to
this
court
that
there
have
been
a
--
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
of
the
use
immunity
statute
here,
that
has
not
been
true
in
a
seventh
circuit,
that
has
not
been
true
in
the
third
circuit,

the
satina
case,

versus
elias
being
in
the
449

2,
page
40
and
more
recently
just
recently,
the
eighth
circuit
also
took
the
view
that
the
ninth
circuit
was
an
error
and
viewed,
viewed
the
underlying
policy
considerations
of
counselmen
as
prevailing
and
i
refer
here
to
united
states
versus
mcdaniel
449
f
2
832
at
page
838.
that
case
incidentally
is
kind
of
interesting
because
it
addresses
itself
to
one
of
the
questions
that
was
put
to
counsel
early
this
morning.
when
counsel
was
asked
about
weather
he
was
overzealous,
whether
a
prosecutor
was
going
to
be
overzealous.
in
that
particular
case,
i
would
point
out
that
counsel
there
was
the
federal
prosecutor
who
because
he
was
informed
by
his
administrative
agencies
that
there
was
a
suspicion
that
a
bank
president
was
defalcating
and
embezzling
monies.
turn
the
matter
over
to
a
state
to
the
state
of
north
or
south
dakota
and
the
state
then
held
an
immunity
grand
jury
proceeding,
on
the
ground
of
immunity
and
then
at
the
request
of
the
united
states
attorney,
turned
that
transcript
over
to
the
united
states
attorney
for
prosecution
and
indictment
followed.
i
would
say
that
the
court
there
held,
that
that
was
prime
facie
evidence
of
the
use
of
fruits
but
i
would
also
point
out
that
it
demonstrates
as
does
of
course,
the
berger
in
295
u.s.
and
number
of
other
cases
demonstrates
that
prosecutors
can
be
at
times
overzealous
and
particularly
when
conferred
with
such
extensive
power
as
appears
to
be
the
case
here.
but
when
i
first
spoke,
i
suggested
that
there
were
other
compelling
reasons
why
i
believe
use
immunity
should
not
prevail
and
one
of
the
most
important
of
those
reasons
of
course
is
that
it
is
inadequate,
that
the
rules
that
are
designed
to
enforce
and
administer
the
use
immunity
concept
are
just
simply
unable
to
effectively
displace
the
fifth
amendment.
in
short,
what
i
content,
what
we
contented
in
our
briefs
is
that
that
the
rules
that
are
designed
to
protect
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendment
in
search
and
seizure
cases
and
in
the
forced
confession
case
are
simply
not
adequate
to
protect
or
to
at
least
define
the
limits
of
the
fifth
amendment.
in
short,
what
is
happening
here,
what
is
being
argued
for
here
is
the
use
of
essentially
procedural
rules
to
define
the
substantive
rights
of
a
witness
and
i
submit
that
that
cannot
be
done
without
creating
some
terrible
problems
for
an
accused
who
is
questioning
whether
the
evidence
used
against
him
in
a
subsequent
prosecution
had
this
tainted.
let
me
suggest
some
concrete
examples
of
what
i
am
referring
to
in
this
concept.
first
of
all,
california,
the
california
supreme
court
decided
in
people
versus
dickson
57
cal
2
at
page
415,
that
was
a
forced
confession
case
and
it
held
there
that
the
fruits
of
a
forced
confession
were
not
admissible
but
it
went
on
to
hold
that
the
fruits
of
a
forced
confession
may
not
be
admissible
but
that
if
the
evidence
was
discoverable,
was
discoverable
by
law
enforcement
that
therefore
that
under
those
circumstances
there
was
an
attenuation
and
that
evidence
would
be
admissible.
and
that
same
theory
that
was
used
in
the
dickson
case
and
in
subsequent
california
supreme
court
cases,
and
the
case
of
like
nature
has
also
been
applied
by
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
in
wayne
versus
united
states
318
federal
second
and
it
was
applied
most
recently
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
a
case,
united
states
versus
jackson
448
federal
second
at
page
970
where
the
court
and
i
am
quoting
said
“it
would
be
speculative
to
conclude
that
but
for
such
information,
the
police
would
not
have
identified
defendants
or
learned
their
place
of
residence.”
i
would
like
to
reserve
some
time
for
reply,
thank
you.
mr.
hugh
r.
manes
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
few
remarks
on
my
rebuttal.
first
i
want
to
state
that
the
case
i
was
referring
to
the
california
supreme
court
case,
people
versus
dickson,
57
cal
second
415
and
there
are
several
other
cases
that
i
have
referred
to
in
my
opening
brief
of
the
same
elk
at
page
40
of
our
opening
brief.
second
point,
i
want
to
make
and
demonstrate
through
this
case
is
that
although
the
government
here
says
we
would
give,
you
know
---
we
would
only
rely
upon
the
rule
that
the
government
must
show
that
it
has
not
discovered
rather
than
use
the
discoverable
rule.
i
would
point
out
to
this
court
that
we
are
talking
about
the
rules
as
they
now
exist
and
are
followed
in
the
various
circuits
and
in
the
states,
and
therefore,
if
the
court
is
of
a
mind
to
be
thinking
in
terms
of
use
immunity,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
very
minimum
that
is
required
at
this
point
is
to
straighten
out
the
rules
first
before
use
immunity
be
considered
as
within
the
scope
of
the
fifth
amendment.
the
other
point,
i
want
to
make
is
that
although
the
government
here
talks
about
having
ample
evidence
before,--
i
will
cite
that
example
above,
that
accused
that
has
ample
evidence
before
he
is
given
immunity,
i
would
say
to
the
government,
why
do
they
not
get
a
conviction,
then
when
they
have
got
a
conviction
they
can
get
the
testimony
without
conferring
immunity
because
of
course,
they
have
no
reason
for
the
rule
for
the
privilege
falls
but
i
cannot
see
as
mr.
justice
stewart
points
out.
i
cannot
see
giving
--
we
already
have
use
immunity.
i
mean,
no
court
is
going
to
allow
compelled
testimony
to
come
in,
we
have
that.
and
then
the
very
minimum,
the
government
must
give
us
something
more.
now,
the
other
point
i
want
to
make
is
the
heavy
burden
that
the
government
talks
about
is
a
losery,
it
is
losery
because
although
the
government
can
seize
that
any
testimony
that
aids
the
government
in
the
prosecution
would
fall
without
the
rule,
i
would
point
out
that
there
are
some
very
compelling
examples
to
show
that
the
government
can
and
will
benefit.
for
example,
when
use
immunity
is
given
to
a
witness,
he
will
be
in
a
grand
jury
proceeding,
he
will
be
asked
some
other
things
about
his
witnesses.
he
will
giving
information.
now,
the
prosecutor
who
examines
him
could
very
well
be
as
the
case
may
turn
out,
the
prosecutor
would
prosecute
him
ultimately
and
will
have
the
benefit
certainly
of
information
on
which
to
draw
his
cross
examination.
but
even
more
compelling
in
the
fact
that
in
this
particular
context
we
are
dealing
with
a
series
of
problems
and
rules
that
as
that
i
pointed
out
exist
and
there
is
no
way
to
escape
from
them,
we
have
rules
for
example
that
come
from
wang
san
and
adonis
which
talk
about
well
a
little
bit
of
evidence
if
it
is
tainted
is
alright,
if
it
is
attenuated.
now,
if
you
are
going
to
talk
about
defining
what
are
the
fifth
amendment
privileges?
is
whether
use
immunity
is
as
broad
as
the
fifth
amendment
privilege,
the
fifth
amendment
says
nothing
about
allowing
a
little
bit
of
tainted
evidence
to
be
compelled
and
used
against
the
accused.
when
we
are
talking
here
about
the
developing
rules,
we
have
our
chaplin
versus
united
states
saying
that
the
announcing
the
harmless
error
rule.
does
that
mean
that
if
a
court
ultimately
concludes
that
well,
a
tainted
evidence
perhaps
was
used
from
the
mouth
of
the
accused
but
after
all
it
is
harmless
in
terms
of
the
total
context
of
the
case,
have
we
not
then
abridged
the
rule?
and
these
are
the
rules
we
respectfully
submit
that
are
used
to
define
the
use
immunity
and
use
immunity
therefore
comes
to
use
something
like
“humpty
dumpy,”
once
the
egg
is
broken,
it
can
never
be
put
together
again
the
same
way.
thank
you.
