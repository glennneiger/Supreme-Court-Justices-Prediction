justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
what
was
the
expense
embraced?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
hold
it
right
there,
is
there
a
fee
provided
for
counsel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
is
there
anything
in
counsel,
are
they
awarded
fees?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
are
direct
outlets.
now
they
do
not
include
any
overhead
for
the
administration
of
the
program.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
gather
to
understand
that
the
administrator's
and
it's
program
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
i
gather
in
this
case
the
only
expense
was
the
$500
paid
to
the
attorney?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
do
you
currently
have
on
the
reasoning
of
the
district
court
that
the
statute
deters
indigents
from
exercising
the
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel,
thus
puts
the
accused
in
the
position
of
deciding
whether
you
can
afford
to
consult
even
with
court
appointed
counsel.
of
course
the
accused
has
not
the
means
to
hire
an
attorney
in
the
first
instance,
so
he
will
not
to
be
in
a
position
to
accept
court
appointed
counsel
when
it
really
means
is
he
has
at
most
90
days
grace
in
paying
the
cost
of
legal
services
rendered
on
his
behalf.
what
is
the
90
days?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
when
is
the
notice
sent?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
30
days
from
what
date?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
date
of
the
payment
appear
as
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
when
an
if
convicted
he
is
probably
serving
a
term?
he
is
in
prison.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let
us
assume
he
is
prison,
now
he
was
indigent
when
he
went
to
trial
he
has
no
money
and
now
he
gets
a
notice
after
the
lawyer
has
been
paid
that
he
must
to
do
what,
pay
within.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
obviously
he
cannot
pay.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
an
interest
runs
on
that
judgment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
he
is
really
helpless
to
do
anything
about
it
because
he
has
been
an
indigent
all
along,
assuming
now
he
was
got
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
was
appointed
counsel
because
he
was
indigent.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let's
us
assume
he
does
(inaudible)
i
guess
that
in
most
of
this
cases
he
is
indigent
when
he
gets
counsel,
he
is
indigent
when
he
is
tried,
he
is
indigent
when
he
is
convicted,
he
is
in
prison
as
an
indigent,
he
does
not
have
a
nickel.
now
he
gets
a
notice
that
he
must
pay
within
60
days
otherwise
a
judgment
is
entered
with
interest
to
run
against
him.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
why
is
it
not
that
observation
of
the
three-judge
court
sound?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
to
his
choice
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whether
he
can
afford
or
even
to
consult
for
court
appointed
counsel.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
will
not
be
in
a
position
to
accept
court
appointed
counsel
and
it
really
means
that
he
has
at
most
90
days
grace
in
paying
the
cost
of
the
legal
services
rather
on
his
behalf.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
is
what
i
gather
what
the
three-judge
court
is
talking
about
in
that
circumstances,
say
then
i
will
not
take
counsel
if
i
have
got
this
burden
on
my
back
if
i
am
convicted
when
i
come
out
i
will
just,
if
tried
the
case
on
my
own.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
suppose
he
gets
twenty
years
prison
term
and
i
gather
the
state
has
--
gives
him
a
sixty-day
notice,
he
is
in
prison,
he
is
still
indigent
and
then
within
two
years
the
state
has
to
sue
him,
isn't
that
right?
no
action
shall
brought
against
any
person
under
the
provision
of
the
section
to
recover
for
sums
expended
on
behalf
of
the
indigent
unless
that
action
has
been
filed
within
two
years
after
the
date
of
the
expenditure
from
the
fund
aid
to
indigents
defense.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
only
to
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
well
then
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
if
he
had
a
twenty
year
term
that
the
lien
runs
out
while
he
was
serving
his
term.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
this
statute
really
puts
the
lawyer
to
option
telling
his
client
always
to
saying
i
will
take
the
$500?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
take
it
you
do
not
get
the
allowance
without
applying
for
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
if
you
had
not
applied
for
it,
it
had
not
been
allowed,
no
judgment
against
the
defendant
would
ever
be
entered.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
is
not
really
a
nice
position
to
be
in,
i
take
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
know
the
statutory
definition
of
an
indigent?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
what
was
the
expense
embraced?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
hold
it
right
there,
is
there
a
fee
provided
for
counsel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
is
there
anything
in
counsel,
are
they
awarded

justice
william
j.

this

now
they
