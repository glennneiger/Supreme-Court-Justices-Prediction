mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
i
suppose
that
i
am
the
one
who
failed
to
tell
david
strange
that
i
was
not
free
court
appointed
counsel
and
consequently,
i
felt
morally
obligated
to
carry
his
cause
pretty
much
at
my
expense.
when
i
first
confronted
david
strange
in
the
jail,
i
was
under
the
impression
that
i
was
free
court
appointed
counsel
and
had
the
statute
had
been
called,
had
i
known
about
the
statute
at
that
time,
the
statute
became
effective
july
1,
i
think
i
was
called
on
july
10,
1969,
some
nine
days
later,
ten
days
later.
i
perhaps
would
have
done
essentially
the
same
thing
i
did
after
i
plead
david
strange
guilty
under
ex
parte
royal
which
i
believe
mr.
justice
brennan
decided
in
the
favor
of
(inaudible).
i
would
have
attempted
to
stop
the
criminal
proceedings
at
that
time
because
contrary
to
what
mr.
chief
justice
burger
has
said
he
thought
he
would
take
judicial
notice
at,
i
think
it
is
important
for
a
young
man
to
be
advised
and
particularly
in
this
young
man's
circumstances
where
he
is
guilty
or
committed
his
first
offense
to
be
given
a
chance
again,
and
that
is
what
he
has
been
grappling
with
in
his
own
situations
from
a
family
of
11
children.
he
had
a
brother
who
was
in
the
hospital
for
the
criminally
insane
who
set
a
bad
example
for
him
when
he
ran
away
from
the
(inaudible)
state
hospital
and
got
him
into
trouble
in
this
case.
after
i
have
plead
him
guilty
to
his
offense
david
strange
got
a
job
and
he
is
working
today.
he
has
a
marginal
existence.
he
does
not
need
this
$500
judgment
or
any
judgment
against
him,
but
he
is
gainfully
occupied.
he
is
taking
care
of
his
wife,
he
is
taking
care
of
his
baby.
this
$500
judgment
at
the
time
that
was
to
be
levied
against
him
on
february
fourth
1970
i
believe
would
have
put
him
in
the
ranks
of
the
people
who
could
not
honestly
apply
for
a
job
because
he
was
judgment
for
material,
he
was
legal
fee
material.
his
work
would
have
required
--
his
judgment
against
him
would
have
caused
his
employer
to
expend
legal
fees
on
his
behalf
just
to
meet
garnishment
problems.
now
the
state
says
and
has
said
all
along
that
there
is
only
the
five
years
involved
but
they
can
renew
this
judgment
by
a
simple
matter
at
the
clerk
of
district
courts
office.
so
whether
if
he
has
five
years
or
twenty
years,
it
is
a
matter
of
levying
execution,
returning
to
execution
unsatisfied.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
i
think
it
would
be
who
the
lawyer
to
render
this
advise
and
i
would
not
want
to
impose
that
burden
upon
any
judge
because
i
think
in
--
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
that
is
right.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
yes
sir.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
that
is
right
it
was
not
and
i
have
thought
about
it
at
considerable
length
before
i
decided
to
go
ahead
and
file
my
voucher
for
payment
of
my
services.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
they
were
paid
for
by
the
county,
expense
of
the
county,
the
board
of
county
commissioner
is
allowed
to
set
aside
a
sum
of
money
for
the
counsel
for
the
indigent.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
without
any
recoupment.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
yes
sir
it
was
a
reaction
to
gideon
versus
wainwright.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
well
i
would
think
so.
i
think
there
would
be
some
instances
where
the
man
was
on
probation
that
a
judge
might
say
you
pay
back
a
certain
sum
of
money
to
your
attorney,
but
you
see
this
particular
statute
starts
out
prior
to
the
time
you
really
learn
the
circumstances
of
the
indigent
accused.
the
accused
stands
charged
and
you
do
not
know
whether
he
is
going
to
get
probation
or
whether
he
wants
to
contest
the
actions
of
the
police,
or
whether
not
he
really
wants
to
have
a
jury
trial,
whether
or
not
he
wants
to
confront
his
witnesses,
whether
or
not
he
wants
to
cross
examine
the
states
witnesses.
this
is
all
done
ahead
of
time
and
as
you
pointed
out
earlier
he
has
no
opportunity
to
determine
what
the
amount
of
his
judgment
might
be
unless
someone
advises
him
in
advance.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
yes
sir
and
in
answer
to
one
of
the
circumstance
i
do
know
that
there
was
a
substantial
judgment
against
an
accused
after
the
trial
in
gallatin
county.
he
decided
he
would
go
ahead
and
contest
the
charges
against
him
and
he
was
ultimately
acquit
it
and
then
he
was
saddled
with
the
judgment.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
with
the
judgment.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
i
think
he
says
a
maximum
of
$500,
but
there
is
an
allowance.
special
circumstances
depending
on
what
the
judge
would
allow
and
what
the
board
of
supervisors
will
allow.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
no
the
county
is
not,
it
is
the
state
board.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
and
i
did
not
contest
that,
the
judicial
administrator
and
one
supreme
court
justice
and
three
of
them.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
they
sort
of
act
together
primarily
to
the
advise
of
the
judicial
administrator.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
i
would
say
that
it
stayed
essentially
the
same.
the
need
for
counsel
in
serious
offense
as
set
down
by
gideon
versus
wainwright
was
recognized
by
the
courts
and
that
as
much
as
anything
determined
that
there
should
be
counsel
appointed,
but
not
the
statute.
it
had
anything
to
do
with
the
statute
i
do
not
believe.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
yes
sir.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
i
would
say
it
is
less
than
half
of
what
i
work
for.
there
is
a
quite
a
bit
of
movement
among
the
lawyers
in
the
legislature
to
do
something
about
that
and
i
would
suspect
that
over
the
course
of
time
as
they
pay
out
more
money
for
peace
or
contract
architects
and
consulting
engineers
and
things
of
that
nature,
that
we
attorneys
will
finally
get
paid
a
reasonable
fee
also.
gideon
versus
wainwright,
i
do
not
want
to
lose
sight
of
that
because
i
feel
like
the
finding
of
the
three-judge
district
court
was
correct.
that
if
the
statute
was
not
to
deter
the
accused
from
exercising
basic
rights,
that
it
is
needless.
it
is
not
necessary.
for
our
democracy
to
work.
we
must
have
a
point
of
emphasize
here.
a
real
finding
that
for
the
poor
in
a
free
society
we
must
provide
free
counsel.
i
do
no
believe
that
is
asking
too
much
of
our
society.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
yes
sir.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
well
i
do
not
think
that
you
can
separate
the
two.
i
believe
a
recoupment
to
be
a,
in
this
particular
instance
to
be
somewhat
of
a
deterrent
of
the
exercise
of
basic
fundamental
rights.
i
want
to
adhere
to
that
policy.
i
feel
that
the
recoupment
provision
is
a
means
of
control
supposedly
of
holding
down
an
accused,
an
indigent
accused
in
exercising
basic
rights.
i
firmly
believe
that.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
yes
sir
i
do.
i
think
--
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
the
actual
mr.
strange?
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
well
as
far
as
squaring
the
person
who
has
eleven
or,
just
above
the
poverty
line,
i
think
probably
the
best
way
that
that
is
provided
for
in
the
statute
is
through
the
judge's
interrogation
as
to
finding
out
what
this
man
has
in
the
way
of
the
family.
what
his
needs
are
and
then
after
he
is,
after
the
judge
has
made
this
judicial
determination
of
indigence
then
he
is
afforded
free
counsel.
i
think
it
is
within
the
judge,
i
do
not
think
i
am
begging
your
question.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
i
think
so
and
i
think
that
the
best
way
to
give
him
free
counsel.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
well
i
know
that
mr.
judge
temper,
my
ex
boss
and
i
have
similar
case
in
federal
court
gave
free
counsel
to
the
man
who
was
making
$13,000
a
year,
making
a
determination
that
he
had
ten
children
that
it
was
more
important
for
him
to
have
a
counsel
in
this
case,
free
counsel
in
the
federal
district
court
case.
in
the
normal
circumstance
you
would
not
determine
that
this
man
making
that
kind
of
money
would
be
poverty
stricken,
but
still
in
need
of
counsel
and
indigent
in
the
legal
sense
i
suppose
and
that
is
up
to
the
judge
to
determine.
after
that
determination
has
been
made
i
feel
like
it
is
in
society's
best
interest
to
make
it
free
and
make
these
rights
variable.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
the
national
defenders
association
and
i
have
to
apologize
to
the
court
i
did
not
know
enough
about
it.
i
make
it
is
pure
eyes
procedures
if
it
was
ahead
of
time
i
may
had
analyzed
all
the
statutes
that
talk
about
poverty
levels
and
if
you
do
not
have
it
i
have
one
copy
of
it,
if
you
would
like
it.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
in
this
particular
case?
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
no
because
you
see
i
did
not
advise
him
that
he
was
going
to
have
to
pay
me
back.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
in
my
brief
is
in
the
district
court's
finding.
that
is
what
they
found
in
their
decisions
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
when
i
filed
--
i
would
say
to
some
extent
that
is
true.
when
i
filed
this
case
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
a
simple
little
matter
because
i
have
not
given
this
person
notice
that
a
judgment
was
about
to
be
rendered
against
him
and
neither
did
the
magistrate
judge
and
neither
did
the
district
judge.
i
thought
i
was
going
to
be
proceeding
on
the
basis
of
due
process
notice
and
it
was
admitted
in
the
stipulations
of
facts
that
there
was
no
notice
given
to
the
indigent
accused.
i
did
not
contemplate
that
the
court
would
keep
this
matter
under
advisement
over
a
year
and
make
a
decision
that
later
on
the
basis
of
some
chilling
effect.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
there
is
nothing
in
another
in
the
notice
that
he
had
to
--
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
he'd
ever
have
notice
either
and
i
do
not
want
to
lose
mr.
david’s
stranger’s
case.
i
did
not
cross
appeal.
i
did
not
feel
that
it
is
necessary
to
cross
appeal
in
a
situation
where
there
is
a
judgment
may
have
been
based
on
some
wrong
reasons
and
i
bring
this
up
in
my
motion
to
dismiss
after
the
jurisdictional
statement
was
filed.
sure
we
go
along
with
the
chilling
effect
and
i
can
understand
that
from
my
own
experience
but
i
--
that
is
not
on
this
record,
but
no
notice
to
this
indigent
accused
is
in
this
record.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
no
the
record
does
not
show.
i
believe
i
have
some
statistics
on
that
that
i
could
give
to
the
clerk.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
from
kansas,
i
was
going
to
put
them
in
but
i
thought
that
$17,000
would
not
--
it
does
not
look
like
even
a
good
deal
for
the
taxpayers.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
or
they
may
decide
particularly
if
this
decision
stands
and
they
--
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
except
that
the
attorney
general
will
probably
test
if
there
was
help
to
keep
down
the
problems
in
court
so
we
can
get
more
guilty
pleas
and
we
can
keep
better
control
--
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
no
sir.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
i
knew
about
the
statute
is
what
you
mean?
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
yes
sir
there
is
a…
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
it
is
a
great
problem
for
me
because
i
was
presumed
to
know
the
law
and
did
not,
and
he
was
to
the
indigent
accused
that
is
presumed
to
know
the
law.
the
magistrate
judge
is
presumed
to
know
the
law,
the
district
judge
was
presumed
to
know
the
law
and
this
indigent
accused
did
not
get
any
notice
at
all
other
than
constructive
notice.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
i
think
that
would,
you
could
assume
that
if
that
were
the
actual
case.
i
think
that
due
process
notice
however
is
talked
about
actual
notice,
not
constructive
notice,
not
assumptive
notice.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
yes
sir
i
went
ahead
at
that
particular
time
and
asked
the
judge
to
waive
the
statute
and
the
indigent
--
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
yes
he
was.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
that
is
right.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
after
the
fees
have
already
been
earned
so
to
speak.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
no
sir
and
the
judge
said
he
did
not
have
any
authority.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
not
at
that
time,
well
yes
he
did
at
time.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
at
the
time
he
was
to
be
afforded
or
provided
a
court
appointed
counsel.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
well
he
did
not
know
that.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
i
think
walker
versus
city
of
hutchinson,
the
due
process
notice
in
them,
the
domain
case.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
yes
sir.
i
think
you
are
talking
about
essentially
not
property
as
such,
but
you
are
talking
about
a
person's
ability
to
make
his
way
in
the
society.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
yes
sir.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
yes
sir.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
i
think
that
would
be
the
case,
your
honor,
because
it
was
brought
up
before
them.
i
do
not
think
it
is
necessary
in
view
of
the
admission
of
the
united
states
that
there
wasn't
any
notice
and
i
had
argued
and
i
do
not
think
that
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
cross
appeal.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
well
he
had
no
notice,
we
do
not
know
whether
if
there
was
--
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
i
have
to
admit
that
there
was
no
deterrence
in
this
case
and
i
admitted
it
--
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
well,
they
--
i
tried
to
--
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
that
is
right,
that's
right.
there
was
another
case,
there
were
other
cases
--
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
that
is
right.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
that
is
what
the
three-judge
district
court
did.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
yes
and
i
think
justifiable.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
[laughter]
well,
i
think
they
consider
this
sort
of
a
class
action,
accused
in
other
similarly
situated
and
they
took
into
consideration
if
they
had
another
case
--
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
that
is
right.
i
would
like
to
make
one
statement
about
fraudulent
conveyances
if
you
want
to
get
talking
about
--
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
no
sir.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
it
would
be
unnecessary
for
the
state
to
have
such
statute
if
someone
makes
a
fraudulent
conveyance
in
these
circumstances.
the
state
would
have
fraud
practiced
upon
him
and
could
exercise
its
common
law
remedy.
this
is
another
thing
mr.
justice
why
they
went
into
3113
(b)
which
dealt
with
fraudulent
conveyance
that
they
declare
the
whole
statute
unconstitutional.
i
was
reading
dealing
this
3113
(a).
i
did
include
them
in
my
petition.
i
included
them
both
in
my
petition
that
the
facts
of
the
case
only
relate
to
3113
(a),
recodified
as
4513
(a).
regardless
of
what
you
find
the
situation
to
be
with
the
three-judge
district
court
in
making
an
overbroad
decision
i
want
to
reiterate
that
their
decision,
that
the
decision
of
gideon
versus
wainwright
is
sound.
this
statute
tends
to
impede
and
infringe
upon
that
decision,
when
you
take
into
consideration
that
we
were
bringing
it
for
as
the
district
court
did,
we
were
bringing
it
for
the
indigent
accused,
this
particular
indigent
accused
and
other
similarly
situated,
that
this
three-judge
district
court
was
justified
in
finding
on
the
basis
of
gideon
versus
wainwright
that
he
must
have
free
counsel
in
order
to
provide
him
with
a
basic
fundamental
right
to
counsel.
a
necessary
fundamental
right
to
counsel,
it
is
not
in
my
estimation
a
right
that
needs
any
subtleties
attached
to
it
as
this
statute
does.
i
urge
the
court
to
uphold
the
decision
of
the
three-judge
district
court
and
to
reiterate
again
that
in
this
society,
we
need
to
provide
free
counsel
to
the
indigent
accused.
i
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
i
suppose
that
i
am
the
one
who
failed
to
tell
david
strange
that
i
was
not
free
court
appointed
counsel
and
consequently,
i
felt
morally
obligated
to
carry
his
cause
pretty
much
at
my
expense.
when
i
first
confronted
david
strange
in
the
jail,
i
was
under
the
impression
that
i
was
free
court
appointed
counsel
and
had
the
statute
had
been
called,
had
i
known
about
the
statute
at
that
time,
the
statute
became
effective
july
1,
i
think
i
was
called
on
july
10,
1969,
some
nine
days
later,
ten
days
later.
i
perhaps
would
have
done
essentially
the
same
thing
i
did
after
i
plead
david
strange
guilty
under
ex
parte
royal
which
i
believe
mr.
justice
brennan
decided
in
the
favor
of
(inaudible).
i
would
have
attempted
to
stop
the
criminal
proceedings
at
that
time
because
contrary
to
what
mr.
chief
justice
burger
has
said
he
thought
he
would
take
judicial
notice
at,
i
think
it
is
important
for
a
young
man
to
be
advised
and
particularly
in
this
young
man's
circumstances
where
he
is
guilty
or
committed
his
first
offense
to
be
given
a
chance
again,
and
that
is
what
he
has
been
grappling
with
in
his
own
situations
from
a
family
of
11
children.
he
had
a
brother
who
was
in
the
hospital
for
the
criminally
insane
who
set
a
bad
example
for
him
when
he
ran
away
from
the
(inaudible)
state
hospital
and
got
him
into
trouble
in
this
case.
after
i
have
plead
him
guilty
to
his
offense
david
strange
got
a
job
and
he
is
working
today.
he
has
a
marginal
existence.
he
does
not
need
this
$500
judgment
or
any
judgment
against
him,
but
he
is
gainfully
occupied.
he
is
taking
care
of
his
wife,
he
is
taking
care
of
his
baby.
this
$500
judgment
at
the
time
that
was
to
be
levied
against
him
on
february
fourth
1970
i
believe
would
have
put
him
in
the
ranks
of
the
people
who
could
not
honestly
apply
for
a
job
because
he
was
judgment
for
material,
he
was
legal
fee
material.
his
work
would
have
required
--
his
judgment
against
him
would
have
caused
his
employer
to
expend
legal
fees
on
his
behalf
just
to
meet
garnishment
problems.
now
the
state
says
and
has
said
all
along
that
there
is
only
the
five
years
involved
but
they
can
renew
this
judgment
by
a
simple
matter
at
the
clerk
of
district
courts
office.
so
whether
if
he
has
five
years
or
twenty
years,
it
is
a
matter
of
levying
execution,
returning
to
execution
unsatisfied.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
i
think
it
would
be
who
the
lawyer
to
render
this
advise
and
i
would
not
want
to
impose
that
burden
upon
any
judge
because
i
think
in
--
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
that
is
right.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
yes
sir.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
that
is
right
it
was
not
and
i
have
thought
about
it
at
considerable
length
before
i
decided
to
go
ahead
and
file
my
voucher
for
payment
of
my
services.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
they
were
paid
for
by
the
county,
expense
of
the
county,
the
board
of
county
commissioner
is
allowed
to
set
aside
a
sum
of
money
for
the
counsel
for
the
indigent.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
without
any
recoupment.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
yes
sir
it
was
a
reaction
to
gideon
versus
wainwright.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
well
i
would
think
so.
i
think
there
would
be
some
instances
where
the
man
was
on
probation
that
a
judge
might
say
you
pay
back
a
certain
sum
of
money
to
your
attorney,
but
you
see
this
particular
statute
starts
out
prior
to
the
time
you
really
learn
the
circumstances
of
the
indigent
accused.
the
accused
stands
charged
and
you
do
not
know
whether
he
is
going
to
get
probation
or
whether
he
wants
to
contest
the
actions
of
the
police,
or
whether
not
he
really
wants
to
have
a
jury
trial,
whether
or
not
he
wants
to
confront
his
witnesses,
whether
or
not
he
wants
to
cross
examine
the
states
witnesses.
this
is
all
done
ahead
of
time
and
as
you
pointed
out
earlier
he
has
no
opportunity
to
determine
what
the
amount
of
his
judgment
might
be
unless
someone
advises
him
in
advance.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
yes
sir
and
in
answer
to
one
of
the
circumstance
i
do
know
that
there
was
a
substantial
judgment
against
an
accused
after
the
trial
in
gallatin
county.
he
decided
he
would
go
ahead
and
contest
the
charges
against
him
and
he
was
ultimately
acquit
it
and
then
he
was
saddled
with
the
judgment.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
with
the
judgment.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
i
think
he
says
a
maximum
of
$500,
but
there
is
an
allowance.
special
circumstances
depending
on
what
the
judge
would
allow
and
what
the
board
of
supervisors
will
allow.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
no
the
county
is
not,
it
is
the
state
board.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
and
i
did
not
contest
that,
the
judicial
administrator
and
one
supreme
court
justice
and
three
of
them.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
they
sort
of
act
together
primarily
to
the
advise
of
the
judicial
administrator.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
i
would
say
that
it
stayed
essentially
the
same.
the
need
for
counsel
in
serious
offense
as
set
down
by
gideon
versus
wainwright
was
recognized
by
the
courts
and
that
as
much
as
anything
determined
that
there
should
be
counsel
appointed,
but
not
the
statute.
it
had
anything
to
do
with
the
statute
i
do
not
believe.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
yes
sir.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
i
would
say
it
is
less
than
half
of
what
i
work
for.
there
is
a
quite
a
bit
of
movement
among
the
lawyers
in
the
legislature
to
do
something
about
that
and
i
would
suspect
that
over
the
course
of
time
as
they
pay
out
more
money
for
peace
or
contract
architects
and
consulting
engineers
and
things
of
that
nature,
that
we
attorneys
will
finally
get
paid
a
reasonable
fee
also.
gideon
versus
wainwright,
i
do
not
want
to
lose
sight
of
that
because
i
feel
like
the
finding
of
the
three-judge
district
court
was
correct.
that
if
the
statute
was
not
to
deter
the
accused
from
exercising
basic
rights,
that
it
is
needless.
it
is
not
necessary.
for
our
democracy
to
work.
we
must
have
a
point
of
emphasize
here.
a
real
finding
that
for
the
poor
in
a
free
society
we
must
provide
free
counsel.
i
do
no
believe
that
is
asking
too
much
of
our
society.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
yes
sir.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
well
i
do
not
think
that
you
can
separate
the
two.
i
believe
a
recoupment
to
be
a,
in
this
particular
instance
to
be
somewhat
of
a
deterrent
of
the
exercise
of
basic
fundamental
rights.
i
want
to
adhere
to
that
policy.
i
feel
that
the
recoupment
provision
is
a
means
of
control
supposedly
of
holding
down
an
accused,
an
indigent
accused
in
exercising
basic
rights.
i
firmly
believe
that.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
yes
sir
i
do.
i
think
--
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
the
actual
mr.
strange?
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
well
as
far
as
squaring
the
person
who
has
eleven
or,
just
above
the
poverty
line,
i
think
probably
the
best
way
that
that
is
provided
for
in
the
statute
is
through
the
judge's
interrogation
as
to
finding
out
what
this
man
has
in
the
way
of
the
family.
what
his
needs
are
and
then
after
he
is,
after
the
judge
has
made
this
judicial
determination
of
indigence
then
he
is
afforded
free
counsel.
i
think
it
is
within
the
judge,
i
do
not
think
i
am
begging
your
question.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
i
think
so
and
i
think
that
the
best
way
to
give
him
free
counsel.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
well
i
know
that
mr.
judge
temper,
my
ex
boss
and
i
have
similar
case
in
federal
court
gave
free
counsel
to
the
man
who
was
making
$13,000
a
year,
making
a
determination
that
he
had
ten
children
that
it
was
more
important
for
him
to
have
a
counsel
in
this
case,
free
counsel
in
the
federal
district
court
case.
in
the
normal
circumstance
you
would
not
determine
that
this
man
making
that
kind
of
money
would
be
poverty
stricken,
but
still
in
need
of
counsel
and
indigent
in
the
legal
sense
i
suppose
and
that
is
up
to
the
judge
to
determine.
after
that
determination
has
been
made
i
feel
like
it
is
in
society's
best
interest
to
make
it
free
and
make
these
rights
variable.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
the
national
defenders
association
and
i
have
to
apologize
to
the
court
i
did
not
know
enough
about
it.
i
make
it
is
pure
eyes
procedures
if
it
was
ahead
of
time
i
may
had
analyzed
all
the
statutes
that
talk
about
poverty
levels
and
if
you
do
not
have
it
i
have
one
copy
of
it,
if
you
would
like
it.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
in
this
particular
case?
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
no
because
you
see
i
did
not
advise
him
that
he
was
going
to
have
to
pay
me
back.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
in
my
brief
is
in
the
district
court's
finding.
that
is
what
they
found
in
their
decisions
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
when
i
filed
--
i
would
say
to
some
extent
that
is
true.
when
i
filed
this
case
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
a
simple
little
matter
because
i
have
not
given
this
person
notice
that
a
judgment
was
about
to
be
rendered
against
him
and
neither
did
the
magistrate
judge
and
neither
did
the
district
judge.
i
thought
i
was
going
to
be
proceeding
on
the
basis
of
due
process
notice
and
it
was
admitted
in
the
stipulations
of
facts
that
there
was
no
notice
given
to
the
indigent
accused.
i
did
not
contemplate
that
the
court
would
keep
this
matter
under
advisement
over
a
year
and
make
a
decision
that
later
on
the
basis
of
some
chilling
effect.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
there
is
nothing
in
another
in
the
notice
that
he
had
to
--
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
he'd
ever
have
notice
either
and
i
do
not
want
to
lose
mr.
david’s
stranger’s
case.
i
did
not
cross
appeal.
i
did
not
feel
that
it
is
necessary
to
cross
appeal
in
a
situation
where
there
is
a
judgment
may
have
been
based
on
some
wrong
reasons
and
i
bring
this
up
in
my
motion
to
dismiss
after
the
jurisdictional
statement
was
filed.
sure
we
go
along
with
the
chilling
effect
and
i
can
understand
that
from
my
own
experience
but
i
--
that
is
not
on
this
record,
but
no
notice
to
this
indigent
accused
is
in
this
record.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
no
the
record
does
not
show.
i
believe
i
have
some
statistics
on
that
that
i
could
give
to
the
clerk.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
from
kansas,
i
was
going
to
put
them
in
but
i
thought
that
$17,000
would
not
--
it
does
not
look
like
even
a
good
deal
for
the
taxpayers.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
or
they
may
decide
particularly
if
this
decision
stands
and
they
--
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
except
that
the
attorney
general
will
probably
test
if
there
was
help
to
keep
down
the
problems
in
court
so
we
can
get
more
guilty
pleas
and
we
can
keep
better
control
--
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
no
sir.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
i
knew
about
the
statute
is
what
you
mean?
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
yes
sir
there
is
a…
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
it
is
a
great
problem
for
me
because
i
was
presumed
to
know
the
law
and
did
not,
and
he
was
to
the
indigent
accused
that
is
presumed
to
know
the
law.
the
magistrate
judge
is
presumed
to
know
the
law,
the
district
judge
was
presumed
to
know
the
law
and
this
indigent
accused
did
not
get
any
notice
at
all
other
than
constructive
notice.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
i
think
that
would,
you
could
assume
that
if
that
were
the
actual
case.
i
think
that
due
process
notice
however
is
talked
about
actual
notice,
not
constructive
notice,
not
assumptive
notice.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
yes
sir
i
went
ahead
at
that
particular
time
and
asked
the
judge
to
waive
the
statute
and
the
indigent
--
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
yes
he
was.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
that
is
right.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
after
the
fees
have
already
been
earned
so
to
speak.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
no
sir
and
the
judge
said
he
did
not
have
any
authority.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
not
at
that
time,
well
yes
he
did
at
time.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
at
the
time
he
was
to
be
afforded
or
provided
a
court
appointed
counsel.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
well
he
did
not
know
that.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
i
think
walker
versus
city
of
hutchinson,
the
due
process
notice
in
them,
the
domain
case.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
yes
sir.
i
think
you
are
talking
about
essentially
not
property
as
such,
but
you
are
talking
about
a
person's
ability
to
make
his
way
in
the
society.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
yes
sir.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
yes
sir.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
i
think
that
would
be
the
case,
your
honor,
because
it
was
brought
up
before
them.
i
do
not
think
it
is
necessary
in
view
of
the
admission
of
the
united
states
that
there
wasn't
any
notice
and
i
had
argued
and
i
do
not
think
that
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
cross
appeal.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
well
he
had
no
notice,
we
do
not
know
whether
if
there
was
--
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
i
have
to
admit
that
there
was
no
deterrence
in
this
case
and
i
admitted
it
--
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
well,
they
--
i
tried
to
--
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
that
is
right,
that's
right.
there
was
another
case,
there
were
other
cases
--
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
that
is
right.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
that
is
what
the
three-judge
district
court
did.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
yes
and
i
think
justifiable.
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
[laughter]
well,
i
think
they
consider
this
sort
of
a
class
action,
accused
in
other
similarly
situated
and
they
took
into
consideration
if
they
had
another
case
--
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
that
is
right.
i
would
like
to
make
one
statement
about
fraudulent
conveyances
if
you
want
to
get
talking
about
--
mr.
john
e.
wilkinson
no
sir.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
it
would
be
unnecessary
for
the
state
to
have
such
statute
if
someone
makes
a
fraudulent
conveyance
in
these
circumstances.
the
state
would
have
fraud
practiced
upon
him
and
could
exercise
its
common
law
remedy.
this
is
another
thing
mr.
justice
why
they
went
into
3113
(b)
which
dealt
with
fraudulent
conveyance
that
they
declare
the
whole
statute
unconstitutional.
i
was
reading
dealing
this
3113
(a).
i
did
include
them
in
my
petition.
i
included
them
both
in
my
petition
that
the
facts
of
the
case
only
relate
to
3113
(a),
recodified
as
4513
(a).
regardless
of
what
you
find
the
situation
to
be
with
the
three-judge
district
court
in
making
an
overbroad
decision
i
want
to
reiterate
that
their
decision,
that
the
decision
of
gideon
versus
wainwright
is
sound.
this
statute
tends
to
impede
and
infringe
upon
that
decision,
when
you
take
into
consideration
that
we
were
bringing
it
for
as
the
district
court
did,
we
were
bringing
it
for
the
indigent
accused,
this
particular
indigent
accused
and
other
similarly
situated,
that
this
three-judge
district
court
was
justified
in
finding
on
the
basis
of
gideon
versus
wainwright
that
he
must
have
free
counsel
in
order
to
provide
him
with
a
basic
fundamental
right
to
counsel.
a
necessary
fundamental
right
to
counsel,
it
is
not
in
my
estimation
a
right
that
needs
any
subtleties
attached
to
it
as
this
statute
does.
i
urge
the
court
to
uphold
the
decision
of
the
three-judge
district
court
and
to
reiterate
again
that
in
this
society,
we
need
to
provide
free
counsel
to
the
indigent
accused.
i
thank
you
very
much.
