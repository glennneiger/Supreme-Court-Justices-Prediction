justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
collister,
let
us
take
an
extreme
case.
suppose
he
inherits
a
million
dollars
next
week,
you
would
expect
him
to
pay
the
$500?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
does
kansas
sue
him
or
is
the
judgment
entered
by
confession?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
then
tell
me
what
is
your
kansas
system?
what
is
that
judgment
of
lien
against
and
how
long
is
it
valid
as
lien?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
wilkinson
help
me
out
on
another
aspect
of
deterrence.
suppose
that
your
client
here
mr.
strange
were
not
an
indigent,
but
he
was
just
above
the
indigency
level
and
he
had
a
fairly
large
family
to
support.
do
you
think
the
fact
of
incurring
legal
fees
to
defend
him
in
a
criminal
case
might
deter
him
from
pleading
not
guilty
and
rather
pushing
him
into
pleading
guilty
to
get
it
over
with?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
how
do
you
square
his
situation
with
an
answer
to
mr.
james.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
strange.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
to
the
point
where
there
are
some
iniquities
built
into
any
system?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
explains
as
to
give
the
true
indigent
free
counsel
and
let
the
just
barely
over
the
indigency
line
sink
or
swim?
justice
harry
a.

suppose

this
lawsuit
you
are
on
your
own.
