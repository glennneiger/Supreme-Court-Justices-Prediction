justice
potter
stewart
they
are
employees
of
the
state
however?
justice
potter
stewart
just
receiving
the
salary
from
the
state?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
lawyers
appointed
on
--
by
contrast
are
private
practitioners
who
are
appointed
for
a
particular
case,
will
get
compensated
by
the
state?
justice
potter
stewart
you
do
not
have
a
--
we
do
not
have
here
a
state
legal
aid?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
now
is
this
under
the
statute,
this
is
a
collectible
equally
whether
the
defendant
is
acquitted
or
convicted,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
familiar
with
the
system
of
at
least
one
state,
at
least
the
way
it
used
to
be
where
if
the
defendant
was
acquitted
that
was
the
end
of
it
and
the
state
absorbed
the
costs,
but
if
he
was
convicted,
he
was
supposed
to
pay
off
the
cost
over
the
period
of
his
time.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
an
equal
protection,
an
attack
could
be
made
upon
that
kind
of
system?
justice
potter
stewart
who
sets
the
fee,
certainly
the
defendant
has
no
say
in
the
amount
of
the
fee?
justice
potter
stewart
what
i
have
in
my
mind
was
i
do
not
know
that
your
brother
on
the
other
side
makes
this
argument
that
the
court
did
decide
this
case,
but
normally
when
a
defendant
is
not
an
indigent,
at
least
there
is
or
might
be
some
negotiation
with
his
own
selected
lawyer
as
to
the
amount
of
the
fee
and
while
he
may
not
be
in
a
very
good
bargaining
position
at
least
he
may
negotiate
a
fee
and
here
the
fee,
the
amount
of
the
fee
is
entirely
beyond
his
control.
he
is
not
consulted
about
it
at
all
and
presumably
again
to
take
an
outrageous
hypothetical
case,
kansas
might
decide
to
pay
lawyers
$10,000
for
this
job
and
i
know
in
fact
you
say
it
is
limited
to
$500
and
if
you
accept
a
non
capital
cases,
but,
or
might
decide
to
pay
$500
for
ten
minutes
of
time
and
then
just
automatically
charge
the
defendant
that
amount
and
then
he
would
not
have
any
say
in
it.
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
no
claim
that
this
amount
is
unreasonable
i
gather
in
this
case
or
that
the
general
fee
schedule
is
on
or
fee
system
is
on
schedule.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
present
counsel
is
in
a
very
good
position
to
challenge
that
reasonable
as
to
the
fee.[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
the
other
side
of
coin
of
course
is
that
he
can
very
well
afford
it,
if
we
assume
he
still
remains
indigent,
the
helpless
party
is
the
state
not
the
indigent
because
they
cannot
collect
a
nickel.
justice
potter
stewart
he
has
a
right
to
counsel.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
would
be
true.
justice
potter
stewart
another
way
would
be
to
plead
not
guilty
and
waive
counsel?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
in
his
interest
to
get
a
long
prison
term.[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
wilkinson
before
the
enactment
of
this
statute
in
your
state
of
kansas
what
was
the
system?
did
lawyers
appointed
to
defend
indigent
criminal
defendants
without
pay
or
were
they
paid
by
the
state
with
no
recoupment?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
without
any
recoupment?
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
was
the
first
statewide
state
law
on
the
subject?
justice
potter
stewart
before
that
was
there
disparity,
were
there
variances
in
the
way
the
various
counties
handled
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
they
are
in
control
over
the
amount
that
is
explained
by
your
brother?
justice
potter
stewart
he
was
saddled
with
the
judgment?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
$500
unless
it
was
a
capital
case.
justice
potter
stewart
the
county
board
is
still
in
the
picture?
justice
potter
stewart
state
board
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
it's
a
state
agency.
justice
potter
stewart
i
notice
in
your
motion
to
dismiss
the
appeal
that
you
filed
here
you
did
indicate
to
us
that
the
primary
issue
before
the
three-judge
court
as
you
saw
it
was
whether
or
not
that
david
strange
has
been
given
notice
at
the
time
counsel
was
appointed
to
him
that
he
would
be
charged
with
paying
that
counsel
in
the
event
he
ever
had
any
money
and
that
was
a
matter
that
the
district,
the
three-judge
district
court
eventually
simply
disregarded.
justice
potter
stewart
so
i
suppose
if
we
should,
in
the
event
that
--
in
the
event
that
this
court
decided
that
the
district
court
was
wrong
on
the
constitutional
issue
it
did
decide
we
should
remand
it
to
the
three-judge
court
to
decide
the
questions
that
you
really
thought
were
the
primary
questions
in
the
case?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
they
