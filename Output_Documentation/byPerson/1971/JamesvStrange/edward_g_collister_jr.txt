mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
one
of
those
cases
that
in
attempting
to
characterize
what
you
are
doing
to
your
colleagues
back
in
the
office,
you
have
a
little
bit
of
difficulty
identifying
exactly
what
it
is
because
i
hate
to
refer
to
it
as
the
strange
case.
what
it
is,
is
a
direct
appeal
from
the
three-judge
court
sitting
in
the
district
of
kansas
which
declared
unconstitutional
and
enjoined
the
future
enforcement
of
a
statute
passed
by
the
1979
kansas
legislature.
the
statute
involved,
ksa
1971
sub
22-4513
is
a
part
of
the
aid
to
indigent
defenders
act
passed
in
that
year
by
that
legislature.
i
think
what
happened
to
generate
the
passage
of
the
entire
act
was
that
the
confusion
that
existed
with
regard
to
the
manner
and
method
of
not
only
determination
of
indigency
for
the
purposes
of
appointing
counsel
in
criminal
cases,
but
also
the
method
of
payment
of
counsel
and
some
fashion
caused
the
legislature
to
pass
a
rather
comprehensive
act
and
that
act
provides
for
the
establishment
of
a
board
of
supervisors
to
govern
the
administrative
work
of
the
system
which
is
administered
directly
by
the
state's
judicial
administrator,
mr.
james.
the
board
of
supervisors
is
authorized
to
cause
to
be
accumulated
a
panel
of
attorneys
in
the
various
districts
and
to
formulate
rules
and
regulations
for
the
implementation
of
the
act.
once
the
panel
of
attorneys
is
formulated,
any
district
judge
or
magistrate
may
rely
on
any
attorney
on
that
panel
for
providing
counsel
to
those
who
he
finds
indigent
and
requiring
counsel.
the
challenged
portion
of
the
act
provides
that
when
any
expense
has
been
advanced
or
paid
by
the
state
on
behalf
of
somebody
who
has
been
found
to
be
indigent,
the
state
is
allowed
an
opportunity
to
cause
repayment
to
--
at
least
be
attempt
a
procedure
that
is
used
in
4513,
a
repayment
statute,
is
that
the
judicial
administrator
causes
a
notice
to
be
sent
to
the
person
upon
whose
behalf
the
expenditure
was
made.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
the
expense
can
embrace
any
amount
of
money
expended
under
the
act
for
the
provision
of
counsel.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
is
it
set
by
the
act?
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
they
are
awarded
fees.
currently
what
--
no
i
should
not
say
currently
because
this
has
been
true
through
the
history
of
the
act,
each
year
the
judicial
administrator
on
behalf
of
the
supreme
court
proposes
a
budget
to
the
state
legislature
which
appropriates
the
money
to
fund
the
indigent
program.
his
estimate
is
really
a
guess,
at
least
it
was
to
start
with,
so
in
any
event
the
money
is
appropriated,
then
the
board
of
supervisors
which
includes
the
judicial
administrator
and
a
justice
of
the
state
supreme
court
determine
rates
of
compensation.
currently
the
rates
are
figured
at
about
$15
to
$20
an
hour.
$15
an
hour
for
out
of
court
time
and
$20
an
hour
for
in
court
time
with
a
maximum
of
$500
in
any
case
not
involving
a
sentence
of
a
life
imprisonment
or
death.
in
another
words
for
practical
purposes
everything,
but
a
capital
case.
also
the
statute
authorizes
the
expenditure
of
funds
to
provide
defense
services,
let
us
say
an
investigator,
i
would
assume
the
transcripts
would
be
included
although
i
have
no
state
decision
controlling
it
one
way
or
another,
perhaps
experts,
fax
or
anything
that
the
state
is
authorized
to
initially
provide
on
the
indigent
defendant's
behalf
under
the
act
which
covers
the
criminal
trial,
the
post
conviction,
the
collateral
attack,
the
appeal
stages
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
i
am
not
sure
that
i
quite
understand.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
i
am
sorry,
the
program
is
administered
by
the
judicial
administrator
who
does
not
receive
any
direct
compensation
for
performing
that
portion
of
his
job
through
the
aid
indigents
defenders
fund.w
hatever
staff
he
has
is
funded
separately.
there
are
no
additional
employees
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
no
sir,
there
is
a
statutory
authorization
for
a
state
public
defender
system,
but
to
my
knowledge
that
has
not
been
implemented
by
the
state.
there
are
two
public
defender
offices,
but
they
are
funded
through
a
federal
grant
on
that
with
a
federal
pay
spread.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
the
statute
appears
to
read
that
way,
yes
sir.
there
is
no
state
decision
interpreting
any
aspect
of
the
statute
handed
down
by
the
state
supreme
court.
whether
they
would
read
some
exceptions
to
those
defendants
who
are
acquitted
into
the
act,
i
do
not
know.
the
statute
applies
equally
across
the
board.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
our
research
i
think
disclose
several
states
where
that
was
the
case.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
i
would
expect.
i
think
the,
regardless
of
what
the
statute
in
its
current
form
provides,
under
the
district
court's
decision,
the
three-judge
court
the
state
would
be
prohibited
from
taking
any
kind
of
action
to
allow
reimbursement
or
recoupment
because
what
the
district
court,
excuse
me,
what
the
three-judge
court
decided.
if
i
may
refer
to
the
court's
opinion
as
printed
on
the
jurisdictional
statement
and
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement,
i
would
like
to
refer
to
pages
seven
and
eight
of
the
appendix,
where
the
three-judge
court
on
page
eighty-seven
says,
“hence
any
construction
of
the
kansas'
statute
which
leaves
intact
the
state's
right
to
recover
legal
expenses
from
indigents
is
a
construction
which
inevitably
impinges
upon
and
determines
the
rights
protected
in
gideon
and
the
same
reasoning
is
employed
in
the
next
page,
leading
us
to
conclude
that
whatever
form
the
state
might
have
enacted
or
might
choose
to
enact
in
the
future,
would
under
that
philosophy
be
an
unconstitutional
burden
on
the
right
to
counsel.
this
action
was
filed
in
a
federal
court
in
behalf
of
a
plaintiff,
david
strange
who
had
been
charged
with
a
felony
crime
in
the
district
court,
ultimately
in
the
district
court
of
shawnee
county
in
the
state
of
kansas.
he
was,
he
received
the
letter
of
demand
from
the
judicial
administrator
notifying
him
of
the
states
claim
as
a
result
of
a
direct
outlay
of
$500
to
his
court
appointed
attorney,
it
was
mr.
wilkinson.
at
that
time
the
federal
court
action
filed
and
ever
since
then
the
state
in
that
case
has
agreed
to
not
proceed
any
further
and
when
the
district
court
handed
down
its
decision,
a
permanent
injunction
restraining
any
enforcement
of
that
provision
of
the
statute
was
also
avoided.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
it's
--
that
is
my
understanding,
yes
sir.
the
issue
as
we
see
it
is
one
that
is
a
little
bit
for
me
to
vocalize.
the
issue
stated
in
the
brief
is
as
follows.
whether
the
existence
of
a
state
statutory
procedure
providing
for
the
collection
from
an
indigent
defendant
of
moneys
expended
by
the
state
to
furnish
him
counsel
constitutes
an
unlawful
burden
upon
an
indigent
defendant's
sixth
amendment
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel
and
that
is
pretty
wordy.
but
it
is
difficult
to
approach
the
subject
without
having
to
do
a
little
bit
of
defining
what
we
are
talking
about.
the
state
has
attempted
to
treat
all
those
who
are
found
to
be
indigent
equally
with
regard
to
this
particular
statute.
they,
the
state
has
attempted
to
treat
them
the
same
as
would
any
civil
judgment
debt
ought
be
treated
in
the
state
courts
with
one
possible
exception
and
that
relates
to
the
exemptions.
the
exemptions
for
civil
judgment
debtor
in
a
state
are
a
little
bit
broader
than
those
under
the
aid
to
indigent
defenders
act
and
the
statute
specifically
defines
what
exemptions
are
available
and
what
are
not,
and
primarily
the
exemption
is
the
homestead
exemption.
the
statute
is
much
broader,
however,
than
simply
allowing
the
state
to
take
a
judgment
against
the
person
found
to
be
indigent
because
it
authorizes
in
effect
the
setting
aside
of
a
fraudulent
conveyance
and
an
establishment
of
a
lien
against
any
property
that
might
have
been
transferred
by
the
indigent
prior
--
subsequent
to
the
time
the
crime
was
committed.
in
trying
to
define
what
the
precise
issue
that,
the
lower
court
treated,
the
three-judge
court,
we
have
to
look
to
the
sixth
amendment,
which
provides
that
in
all
criminal
prosecutions
the
accused
shall
enjoy
the
right
to
have
the
assistance
of
counsel
and
the
precise
question
we
ask
is,
what
does
it
mean
when
it
says
the
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel?
does
it
mean
that
the
state
has
to
provide
free
counsel?
because
that
is
adding
a
word
that
is
not
in
the
constitution
and
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
relating
to
the
right
to
counsel,
when
this
court
speaks
in
terms
of
protecting
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
by
providing
counsel
or
seeing
that
the
defendant
at
a
criminal
trial
has
the
opportunity
to
be
heard
by
a
counsel,
does
that
mean
that
the
state
has
to
bear
the
expense
of
providing
that
counsel
under
all
circumstances?
it
is
a
state's
position
that
at
the
time
the
criminal
defendant
is
tried
in
the
state
of
kansas
under
the
aid
to
indigent
defenders
act,
the
constitutional
right
to
counsel
is
protected.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
it
is
protected
in
that
manner
with
same
limitations
that
exist
with
regard
to
any
other
civil
judgment
at
the
time
period,
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
i
understand
that
the
same…
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
i
do
not
know
that
i
can
qualify
as
a
penologist.
i
think
what
it
does
do
is
it
creates
an
impression
with
him
that
there
are
certain
consequences
of
his
acts
other
than
the
mere
commission
of
the
crime,
as
in
this
case
achieving
a
status
of
probation
just
as
the
person
who
did
not
qualify
as
an
indigent
and
did
have
some
financial
consequences
that
did
hurt
him.
that
he
did
have
to
remember
because
he
had
to
--
he
had
to
purchase
the
services
of
counsel,
would
remember
the
same
thing.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
if
he
has,
yea
sir
--
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
well,
the
statute
provides
that
that
will
occur
if
--
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
within
a
five-year
period,
i
mean
i
do
not
--
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
within
five
years
and
the
state
can
collect
it.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
well,
that
is
in
practice
i
think
that
is
a
lot
more
difficult
to
answer
than
it
would
appear.
my
impression
would
be
that
he
would
not
if
he
could
afford
to
use
that
money
for
the
services
of
an
attorney.
of
course,
he
would
claim
that
he
could
not
use
that
money
for
the
services
of
an
attorney
or
that
he
was
not
sure
that
much
money
would
be
enough
because
the
attorney
who
represented
him
on
retainer
basis
might
say
i
will
charge
on
hourly
basis.
practically,
whether
or
not
that
would
in
fact
occur,
i
think
it
is
maybe
debatable,
but
as
a
matter
of
abstraction,
i
would
think
that
would
be
the
case.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
no
sir,
i
am
assuming
that
they
have
a
set
agreement
that
he
is
to
receive
only
$250,
not
something
dependent
upon
acquiring
money.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
i
do
not
have
any
statistics
that
would
lead
to
a
conclusion
one
way
or
another.
my
guess
is
not
because
i
do
know
that
we
are
trying
a
lot
more
cases
than
we
have
in
the
past,
generally.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
a
claim
is
made
by
the
attorney
to
--
which
has
to
be
approved
by
the
judge
who
presided
over
the
case
to
the
appointing
in
the
appointing
hearing.
a
claim
is
then
submitted
to
the
judicial
administrator
to
present
to
the
panel
that
supervises
the
entire
operation
of
the
act.
assuming
that
the
rate
that
is
then
in
existence
is
followed,
that
is
approved.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
there
are
conceivable
situations
which
might
be
subject
to
a
different
kind
of
attack
than
the
present
statute
where
an
unreasonable
is
charged.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
i
do
not
believe
so
and
further
more
the
basis
of
the
three-judge
court's
decision
was
that
any
attempt
regardless
of
whether
it
was
a
5%
of
what
the
regular
minimum
schedule
would
be,
would
be
an
unconstitutional
burden
on
the
exercise
of
the
right
of
counsel.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
well
again
i
do
not
have,
that
is
not
a
--
my
answer
cannot
be
documented.
but
my
assessment
of
what
is
occurring
would
be
that
because
of
other
reasons,
our
judges
are
getting
much
more
careful
about
examining
persons
who
allege
they
are
indigent
for
the
purposes
of
appointing
an
attorney
and
the
primary
reason
is
that
the
increase
in
the
number
of
representations
by
attorneys
in
court
appointed
cases
has
increased
so
much
in
the
last
three
to
four
years
that
the
courts
are
becoming
very,
are
much
more
seriously
inquiring
as
to
the
indigency
status
than
they
ever
did
before
and
that
approach
is
implemented
even
more
by
the
statute,
which
the
current
statute
which
is
in
another,
current
act,
excuse
me,
which
is
another
provision
specifically
authorizes
the
trial
judge
if
he
wishes
in
his
discretion
to
require
the
indigent
applicant
to
file
an
affidavit
setting
out
certain
information
concerning
his
finances.
so
my
guess
is
that,
there
is
more
inquiry,
more
inquiry
going
on
right
now.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
correct.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
not
to
my
knowledge.
i
have
been
in
the
attorney
general's
office
for
four
years
and
i
have
not
heard
of
anything
that
has
caused
the
legislature
to
become,
to
react
in
that
fashion
and
i
suspect
that
what
is
happening
in
our
state
is
happening
to
so
many
other
places
in
the
last
three
to
five
years
is
that
every
year
we
get
into
continual
fight
in
the
legislature
about
who
is
going
to
get
what
money
is
available
and
how
we
are
going
to
get
that
money.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
reflected
in
this
very
same
act,
in
1971
when
the
legislature
almost
refused
to
extend
any
money
to
the
judicial
--
to
appropriate
any
money
to
the
judicial
administrator
to
administer
under
the
act.
i
suspect
that
what
they
were
concerned
about
was
trying
to
recover
as
much
money
as
they
could
and
there
has
been
some
recovery
and
i
recognize
that
that
recovery
is
not
very
much
compared
to
the
total
expended.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
the
period
of
time
that
the
recoupment
provision
has
been
in
effect
from
which
approximately
july
1
of
1969
through
the
first
part
of
1971
when
the
three-judge
court
declared
the
statute
unconstitutional,
there
has
been
no
attempted
collection
since
then,
so
it
is
about
one
year
and
eight
or
nine
months.
i
do
not
know
how
effective
the
provision
would
be
to
collecting
a
greater
sum
of
money
because
we
have
not
had
that
much
expenditure
to
be
quite
honest
about
it.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
it
is
approximately
$17,000.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
roughly,
whether
or
not
the
work
that
has
to
be
done
by
the
judicial
administrator,
the
attorney
general's
office
and
the
county
attorneys
in
the
state
that
justify
that
kind
of
recovery
may
be
debatable,
but
that
is
the
province
of
the
legislature
to
decide
what
policy
that
it
want
to
implement
as
long
as
of
course
it
does
not
violate
the
constitution.
our
feeling
about
the
subject
matter
of
the
district
court's
opinion
is
that
the
right
to
counsel,
the
opportunity
to
be
heard
by
counsel
is
granted
and
implemented
by
the
act.
we
reviewed
the
decisions
of
various
courts.
we
find
very
few
end
points
on
this
particular
issue.
the
california
supreme
court
has
held
that
you
can't
as
a
condition
in
a
probation
require
reimbursement
of
moneys
expended
making
much
the
same
argument
that
is
made
in
this
case.
the
iowa
supreme
court
in
dicta
indicated
that
if
the
state
legislature
would
adopt
the
statute,
i
am
assuming
that
it
would
be
similar
in
substance
to
ours
that
the
state
could
recover
money.
the
ohio
court
of
appeals
has
allowed
a
similar
procedure
in
ohio,
but
other
than
--
the
supreme
court
of
new
hampshire
has
rendered
an
advisory
opinion
that
when
i
read
it
at
least
indicates
that
under
their
state
constitution
which
is
different
than
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
kansas,
the
state
has
to
provide
free
counsel
because
of
the
wording
of
the
new
hampshire
constitution.
that
is
about
the
sum
total
of
the
precedent
that
we
are
able
to
present
that
either
side
is
able
to
present
for
that
matter.
the
issues
as
seen
by
the
three-judge
court
were
one,
whether
or
not
the
right
to
counsel
encompasses
an
absolute
requirement
that
the
state
provide
free
counsel
as
opposed
to
allowing
the
opportunity
to
be
heard
by
counsel.
secondly
whether
or
not
the
statute
imposes
an
unconstitutional
burden
on
the
exercise
of
a
constitutional
right
directing
my
attention
to
the
later
those
whether
or
not
the
burden
is
needless
or
unreasonable.
in
part
those
have
to
be
in
this
kind
of
a
case
i
think
determinations
of
the
legislature
whether
this
kind
of
a
policy
is
justified
with
the
obvious
time
and
trouble
that
state
officials
have
to
go
through.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
the
90
days
after
the
notice
is
sent.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
the
judicial
administrator
has
30
days
in
which
to
send
out
the
notice
and
then
the
--
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
the
date
the
money
is
expended.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
which
may
come
after
the
final
action
on
the
criminal
case.
usually
it
does
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
then
--
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
or
on
probation.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
within
60
days
--
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
and
if
in
fact
he
does
not
pay,
a
judgment
is
taken
against
him.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
inter
strands
on
that
judgment.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
assuming
that
he's
been
indigent
all
along.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
at
some
time
prior
he
was
whether
anything
intervenes
or
not
i
will
assume
that
it
in
most
cases
--
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
the
statute
as
it
exists
creates
an
impediment
to
his
choice.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
to
his
choice
of
whether
to
accept
--
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
i
have
to
admit
that
is
--
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
i
--
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
that
is
also
true.
my
thought
about
the
question
that
mr.
justice
brennan
asked
was
if
that
in
fact
is
true,
then
our
entire
system
of
appointing,
excuse
me,
then
our
entire
system
of
requiring
representation
of
counsel
in
criminal
cases
is
unconstitutional
for
all
cases
except
those
who
unlike
myself
are
wealthy
enough
to
afford
any
lawyer
that
they
want
to
affor.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
if
he
pleads
guilty
he
--
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
if
nothing
has
been
expanded,
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
yes
it
would
be.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
that
is
a
possibility
yes.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
to
my
knowledge
i
do
not
have
any
personal
knowledge
either
way.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
to
my
knowledge
none.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
that
is
correct,
the
attorney
is
paid
on
an
hourly
basis.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
the
maximum
--
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
that
is
correct
and
the
rate
is
much
below
that
which
is
charged
in
metropolitan
areas
of
kansas
on
the
minimum
--
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
provision
for
that
sir.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
the
judgment
is
entered
in
effect
by
confession
and
then
it
is
enforceable
by
the
state
in
a
proceeding.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
the
judgment
is
the
lien
against
--
let
me
approach
that
question
by
answering
this
way.
the
judgment
is
treated
almost
exactly
the
same
as
would
any
judgment
in
the
civil
case.
it
is
to
lien
against
all
property
that
a
civil
judgment
would
operate
against.
the
homestead
exemption
exists,
the
lien
exists
for
five
years
unless
execution
is
issued.
if
execution
is
not
issued
it
becomes
dormant
and
it's
subject
to
reviver
within
a
two-year
period
just
as
are
all
civil
judgments
which
all
are
liens.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
i
think
that
provision
relates
to
the
suit
against
the
person
to
whom
property
has
been
fraudulently
been
transferred.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
otherwise
the
judgment
when
it
is
filed
would
operate
as
a
lien
for
five
years
just
as
--
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
i
see
that
my
time
has
run
out.
i
do
not
have
anything
further
to
say.
we
have
tried
in
our
brief.
we
cite
the
authorities
we
found
available
and
the
similar
or
other
statutes
in
other
states
comparable
to
ours.
thank
you.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
one
of
those
cases
that
in
attempting
to
characterize
what
you
are
doing
to
your
colleagues
back
in
the
office,
you
have
a
little
bit
of
difficulty
identifying
exactly
what
it
is
because
i
hate
to
refer
to
it
as
the
strange
case.
what
it
is,
is
a
direct
appeal
from
the
three-judge
court
sitting
in
the
district
of
kansas
which
declared
unconstitutional
and
enjoined
the
future
enforcement
of
a
statute
passed
by
the
1979
kansas
legislature.
the
statute
involved,
ksa
1971
sub
22-4513
is
a
part
of
the
aid
to
indigent
defenders
act
passed
in
that
year
by
that
legislature.
i
think
what
happened
to
generate
the
passage
of
the
entire
act
was
that
the
confusion
that
existed
with
regard
to
the
manner
and
method
of
not
only
determination
of
indigency
for
the
purposes
of
appointing
counsel
in
criminal
cases,
but
also
the
method
of
payment
of
counsel
and
some
fashion
caused
the
legislature
to
pass
a
rather
comprehensive
act
and
that
act
provides
for
the
establishment
of
a
board
of
supervisors
to
govern
the
administrative
work
of
the
system
which
is
administered
directly
by
the
state's
judicial
administrator,
mr.
james.
the
board
of
supervisors
is
authorized
to
cause
to
be
accumulated
a
panel
of
attorneys
in
the
various
districts
and
to
formulate
rules
and
regulations
for
the
implementation
of
the
act.
once
the
panel
of
attorneys
is
formulated,
any
district
judge
or
magistrate
may
rely
on
any
attorney
on
that
panel
for
providing
counsel
to
those
who
he
finds
indigent
and
requiring
counsel.
the
challenged
portion
of
the
act
provides
that
when
any
expense
has
been
advanced
or
paid
by
the
state
on
behalf
of
somebody
who
has
been
found
to
be
indigent,
the
state
is
allowed
an
opportunity
to
cause
repayment
to
--
at
least
be
attempt
a
procedure
that
is
used
in
4513,
a
repayment
statute,
is
that
the
judicial
administrator
causes
a
notice
to
be
sent
to
the
person
upon
whose
behalf
the
expenditure
was
made.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
the
expense
can
embrace
any
amount
of
money
expended
under
the
act
for
the
provision
of
counsel.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
is
it
set
by
the
act?
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
they
are
awarded
fees.
currently
what
--
no
i
should
not
say
currently
because
this
has
been
true
through
the
history
of
the
act,
each
year
the
judicial
administrator
on
behalf
of
the
supreme
court
proposes
a
budget
to
the
state
legislature
which
appropriates
the
money
to
fund
the
indigent
program.
his
estimate
is
really
a
guess,
at
least
it
was
to
start
with,
so
in
any
event
the
money
is
appropriated,
then
the
board
of
supervisors
which
includes
the
judicial
administrator
and
a
justice
of
the
state
supreme
court
determine
rates
of
compensation.
currently
the
rates
are
figured
at
about
$15
to
$20
an
hour.
$15
an
hour
for
out
of
court
time
and
$20
an
hour
for
in
court
time
with
a
maximum
of
$500
in
any
case
not
involving
a
sentence
of
a
life
imprisonment
or
death.
in
another
words
for
practical
purposes
everything,
but
a
capital
case.
also
the
statute
authorizes
the
expenditure
of
funds
to
provide
defense
services,
let
us
say
an
investigator,
i
would
assume
the
transcripts
would
be
included
although
i
have
no
state
decision
controlling
it
one
way
or
another,
perhaps
experts,
fax
or
anything
that
the
state
is
authorized
to
initially
provide
on
the
indigent
defendant's
behalf
under
the
act
which
covers
the
criminal
trial,
the
post
conviction,
the
collateral
attack,
the
appeal
stages
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
i
am
not
sure
that
i
quite
understand.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
i
am
sorry,
the
program
is
administered
by
the
judicial
administrator
who
does
not
receive
any
direct
compensation
for
performing
that
portion
of
his
job
through
the
aid
indigents
defenders
fund.w
hatever
staff
he
has
is
funded
separately.
there
are
no
additional
employees
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
no
sir,
there
is
a
statutory
authorization
for
a
state
public
defender
system,
but
to
my
knowledge
that
has
not
been
implemented
by
the
state.
there
are
two
public
defender
offices,
but
they
are
funded
through
a
federal
grant
on
that
with
a
federal
pay
spread.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
the
statute
appears
to
read
that
way,
yes
sir.
there
is
no
state
decision
interpreting
any
aspect
of
the
statute
handed
down
by
the
state
supreme
court.
whether
they
would
read
some
exceptions
to
those
defendants
who
are
acquitted
into
the
act,
i
do
not
know.
the
statute
applies
equally
across
the
board.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
our
research
i
think
disclose
several
states
where
that
was
the
case.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
i
would
expect.
i
think
the,
regardless
of
what
the
statute
in
its
current
form
provides,
under
the
district
court's
decision,
the
three-judge
court
the
state
would
be
prohibited
from
taking
any
kind
of
action
to
allow
reimbursement
or
recoupment
because
what
the
district
court,
excuse
me,
what
the
three-judge
court
decided.
if
i
may
refer
to
the
court's
opinion
as
printed
on
the
jurisdictional
statement
and
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement,
i
would
like
to
refer
to
pages
seven
and
eight
of
the
appendix,
where
the
three-judge
court
on
page
eighty-seven
says,
“hence
any
construction
of
the
kansas'
statute
which
leaves
intact
the
state's
right
to
recover
legal
expenses
from
indigents
is
a
construction
which
inevitably
impinges
upon
and
determines
the
rights
protected
in
gideon
and
the
same
reasoning
is
employed
in
the
next
page,
leading
us
to
conclude
that
whatever
form
the
state
might
have
enacted
or
might
choose
to
enact
in
the
future,
would
under
that
philosophy
be
an
unconstitutional
burden
on
the
right
to
counsel.
this
action
was
filed
in
a
federal
court
in
behalf
of
a
plaintiff,
david
strange
who
had
been
charged
with
a
felony
crime
in
the
district
court,
ultimately
in
the
district
court
of
shawnee
county
in
the
state
of
kansas.
he
was,
he
received
the
letter
of
demand
from
the
judicial
administrator
notifying
him
of
the
states
claim
as
a
result
of
a
direct
outlay
of
$500
to
his
court
appointed
attorney,
it
was
mr.
wilkinson.
at
that
time
the
federal
court
action
filed
and
ever
since
then
the
state
in
that
case
has
agreed
to
not
proceed
any
further
and
when
the
district
court
handed
down
its
decision,
a
permanent
injunction
restraining
any
enforcement
of
that
provision
of
the
statute
was
also
avoided.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
it's
--
that
is
my
understanding,
yes
sir.
the
issue
as
we
see
it
is
one
that
is
a
little
bit
for
me
to
vocalize.
the
issue
stated
in
the
brief
is
as
follows.
whether
the
existence
of
a
state
statutory
procedure
providing
for
the
collection
from
an
indigent
defendant
of
moneys
expended
by
the
state
to
furnish
him
counsel
constitutes
an
unlawful
burden
upon
an
indigent
defendant's
sixth
amendment
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel
and
that
is
pretty
wordy.
but
it
is
difficult
to
approach
the
subject
without
having
to
do
a
little
bit
of
defining
what
we
are
talking
about.
the
state
has
attempted
to
treat
all
those
who
are
found
to
be
indigent
equally
with
regard
to
this
particular
statute.
they,
the
state
has
attempted
to
treat
them
the
same
as
would
any
civil
judgment
debt
ought
be
treated
in
the
state
courts
with
one
possible
exception
and
that
relates
to
the
exemptions.
the
exemptions
for
civil
judgment
debtor
in
a
state
are
a
little
bit
broader
than
those
under
the
aid
to
indigent
defenders
act
and
the
statute
specifically
defines
what
exemptions
are
available
and
what
are
not,
and
primarily
the
exemption
is
the
homestead
exemption.
the
statute
is
much
broader,
however,
than
simply
allowing
the
state
to
take
a
judgment
against
the
person
found
to
be
indigent
because
it
authorizes
in
effect
the
setting
aside
of
a
fraudulent
conveyance
and
an
establishment
of
a
lien
against
any
property
that
might
have
been
transferred
by
the
indigent
prior
--
subsequent
to
the
time
the
crime
was
committed.
in
trying
to
define
what
the
precise
issue
that,
the
lower
court
treated,
the
three-judge
court,
we
have
to
look
to
the
sixth
amendment,
which
provides
that
in
all
criminal
prosecutions
the
accused
shall
enjoy
the
right
to
have
the
assistance
of
counsel
and
the
precise
question
we
ask
is,
what
does
it
mean
when
it
says
the
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel?
does
it
mean
that
the
state
has
to
provide
free
counsel?
because
that
is
adding
a
word
that
is
not
in
the
constitution
and
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
relating
to
the
right
to
counsel,
when
this
court
speaks
in
terms
of
protecting
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
by
providing
counsel
or
seeing
that
the
defendant
at
a
criminal
trial
has
the
opportunity
to
be
heard
by
a
counsel,
does
that
mean
that
the
state
has
to
bear
the
expense
of
providing
that
counsel
under
all
circumstances?
it
is
a
state's
position
that
at
the
time
the
criminal
defendant
is
tried
in
the
state
of
kansas
under
the
aid
to
indigent
defenders
act,
the
constitutional
right
to
counsel
is
protected.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
it
is
protected
in
that
manner
with
same
limitations
that
exist
with
regard
to
any
other
civil
judgment
at
the
time
period,
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
i
understand
that
the
same…
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
i
do
not
know
that
i
can
qualify
as
a
penologist.
i
think
what
it
does
do
is
it
creates
an
impression
with
him
that
there
are
certain
consequences
of
his
acts
other
than
the
mere
commission
of
the
crime,
as
in
this
case
achieving
a
status
of
probation
just
as
the
person
who
did
not
qualify
as
an
indigent
and
did
have
some
financial
consequences
that
did
hurt
him.
that
he
did
have
to
remember
because
he
had
to
--
he
had
to
purchase
the
services
of
counsel,
would
remember
the
same
thing.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
if
he
has,
yea
sir
--
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
well,
the
statute
provides
that
that
will
occur
if
--
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
within
a
five-year
period,
i
mean
i
do
not
--
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
within
five
years
and
the
state
can
collect
it.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
well,
that
is
in
practice
i
think
that
is
a
lot
more
difficult
to
answer
than
it
would
appear.
my
impression
would
be
that
he
would
not
if
he
could
afford
to
use
that
money
for
the
services
of
an
attorney.
of
course,
he
would
claim
that
he
could
not
use
that
money
for
the
services
of
an
attorney
or
that
he
was
not
sure
that
much
money
would
be
enough
because
the
attorney
who
represented
him
on
retainer
basis
might
say
i
will
charge
on
hourly
basis.
practically,
whether
or
not
that
would
in
fact
occur,
i
think
it
is
maybe
debatable,
but
as
a
matter
of
abstraction,
i
would
think
that
would
be
the
case.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
no
sir,
i
am
assuming
that
they
have
a
set
agreement
that
he
is
to
receive
only
$250,
not
something
dependent
upon
acquiring
money.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
i
do
not
have
any
statistics
that
would
lead
to
a
conclusion
one
way
or
another.
my
guess
is
not
because
i
do
know
that
we
are
trying
a
lot
more
cases
than
we
have
in
the
past,
generally.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
a
claim
is
made
by
the
attorney
to
--
which
has
to
be
approved
by
the
judge
who
presided
over
the
case
to
the
appointing
in
the
appointing
hearing.
a
claim
is
then
submitted
to
the
judicial
administrator
to
present
to
the
panel
that
supervises
the
entire
operation
of
the
act.
assuming
that
the
rate
that
is
then
in
existence
is
followed,
that
is
approved.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
there
are
conceivable
situations
which
might
be
subject
to
a
different
kind
of
attack
than
the
present
statute
where
an
unreasonable
is
charged.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
i
do
not
believe
so
and
further
more
the
basis
of
the
three-judge
court's
decision
was
that
any
attempt
regardless
of
whether
it
was
a
5%
of
what
the
regular
minimum
schedule
would
be,
would
be
an
unconstitutional
burden
on
the
exercise
of
the
right
of
counsel.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
well
again
i
do
not
have,
that
is
not
a
--
my
answer
cannot
be
documented.
but
my
assessment
of
what
is
occurring
would
be
that
because
of
other
reasons,
our
judges
are
getting
much
more
careful
about
examining
persons
who
allege
they
are
indigent
for
the
purposes
of
appointing
an
attorney
and
the
primary
reason
is
that
the
increase
in
the
number
of
representations
by
attorneys
in
court
appointed
cases
has
increased
so
much
in
the
last
three
to
four
years
that
the
courts
are
becoming
very,
are
much
more
seriously
inquiring
as
to
the
indigency
status
than
they
ever
did
before
and
that
approach
is
implemented
even
more
by
the
statute,
which
the
current
statute
which
is
in
another,
current
act,
excuse
me,
which
is
another
provision
specifically
authorizes
the
trial
judge
if
he
wishes
in
his
discretion
to
require
the
indigent
applicant
to
file
an
affidavit
setting
out
certain
information
concerning
his
finances.
so
my
guess
is
that,
there
is
more
inquiry,
more
inquiry
going
on
right
now.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
correct.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
not
to
my
knowledge.
i
have
been
in
the
attorney
general's
office
for
four
years
and
i
have
not
heard
of
anything
that
has
caused
the
legislature
to
become,
to
react
in
that
fashion
and
i
suspect
that
what
is
happening
in
our
state
is
happening
to
so
many
other
places
in
the
last
three
to
five
years
is
that
every
year
we
get
into
continual
fight
in
the
legislature
about
who
is
going
to
get
what
money
is
available
and
how
we
are
going
to
get
that
money.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
reflected
in
this
very
same
act,
in
1971
when
the
legislature
almost
refused
to
extend
any
money
to
the
judicial
--
to
appropriate
any
money
to
the
judicial
administrator
to
administer
under
the
act.
i
suspect
that
what
they
were
concerned
about
was
trying
to
recover
as
much
money
as
they
could
and
there
has
been
some
recovery
and
i
recognize
that
that
recovery
is
not
very
much
compared
to
the
total
expended.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
the
period
of
time
that
the
recoupment
provision
has
been
in
effect
from
which
approximately
july
1
of
1969
through
the
first
part
of
1971
when
the
three-judge
court
declared
the
statute
unconstitutional,
there
has
been
no
attempted
collection
since
then,
so
it
is
about
one
year
and
eight
or
nine
months.
i
do
not
know
how
effective
the
provision
would
be
to
collecting
a
greater
sum
of
money
because
we
have
not
had
that
much
expenditure
to
be
quite
honest
about
it.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
it
is
approximately
$17,000.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
roughly,
whether
or
not
the
work
that
has
to
be
done
by
the
judicial
administrator,
the
attorney
general's
office
and
the
county
attorneys
in
the
state
that
justify
that
kind
of
recovery
may
be
debatable,
but
that
is
the
province
of
the
legislature
to
decide
what
policy
that
it
want
to
implement
as
long
as
of
course
it
does
not
violate
the
constitution.
our
feeling
about
the
subject
matter
of
the
district
court's
opinion
is
that
the
right
to
counsel,
the
opportunity
to
be
heard
by
counsel
is
granted
and
implemented
by
the
act.
we
reviewed
the
decisions
of
various
courts.
we
find
very
few
end
points
on
this
particular
issue.
the
california
supreme
court
has
held
that
you
can't
as
a
condition
in
a
probation
require
reimbursement
of
moneys
expended
making
much
the
same
argument
that
is
made
in
this
case.
the
iowa
supreme
court
in
dicta
indicated
that
if
the
state
legislature
would
adopt
the
statute,
i
am
assuming
that
it
would
be
similar
in
substance
to
ours
that
the
state
could
recover
money.
the
ohio
court
of
appeals
has
allowed
a
similar
procedure
in
ohio,
but
other
than
--
the
supreme
court
of
new
hampshire
has
rendered
an
advisory
opinion
that
when
i
read
it
at
least
indicates
that
under
their
state
constitution
which
is
different
than
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
kansas,
the
state
has
to
provide
free
counsel
because
of
the
wording
of
the
new
hampshire
constitution.
that
is
about
the
sum
total
of
the
precedent
that
we
are
able
to
present
that
either
side
is
able
to
present
for
that
matter.
the
issues
as
seen
by
the
three-judge
court
were
one,
whether
or
not
the
right
to
counsel
encompasses
an
absolute
requirement
that
the
state
provide
free
counsel
as
opposed
to
allowing
the
opportunity
to
be
heard
by
counsel.
secondly
whether
or
not
the
statute
imposes
an
unconstitutional
burden
on
the
exercise
of
a
constitutional
right
directing
my
attention
to
the
later
those
whether
or
not
the
burden
is
needless
or
unreasonable.
in
part
those
have
to
be
in
this
kind
of
a
case
i
think
determinations
of
the
legislature
whether
this
kind
of
a
policy
is
justified
with
the
obvious
time
and
trouble
that
state
officials
have
to
go
through.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
the
90
days
after
the
notice
is
sent.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
the
judicial
administrator
has
30
days
in
which
to
send
out
the
notice
and
then
the
--
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
the
date
the
money
is
expended.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
which
may
come
after
the
final
action
on
the
criminal
case.
usually
it
does
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
then
--
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
or
on
probation.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
within
60
days
--
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
and
if
in
fact
he
does
not
pay,
a
judgment
is
taken
against
him.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
inter
strands
on
that
judgment.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
assuming
that
he's
been
indigent
all
along.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
at
some
time
prior
he
was
whether
anything
intervenes
or
not
i
will
assume
that
it
in
most
cases
--
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
the
statute
as
it
exists
creates
an
impediment
to
his
choice.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
to
his
choice
of
whether
to
accept
--
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
i
have
to
admit
that
is
--
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
i
--
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
that
is
also
true.
my
thought
about
the
question
that
mr.
justice
brennan
asked
was
if
that
in
fact
is
true,
then
our
entire
system
of
appointing,
excuse
me,
then
our
entire
system
of
requiring
representation
of
counsel
in
criminal
cases
is
unconstitutional
for
all
cases
except
those
who
unlike
myself
are
wealthy
enough
to
afford
any
lawyer
that
they
want
to
affor.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
if
he
pleads
guilty
he
--
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
if
nothing
has
been
expanded,
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
yes
it
would
be.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
that
is
a
possibility
yes.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
to
my
knowledge
i
do
not
have
any
personal
knowledge
either
way.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
to
my
knowledge
none.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
that
is
correct,
the
attorney
is
paid
on
an
hourly
basis.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
the
maximum
--
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
that
is
correct
and
the
rate
is
much
below
that
which
is
charged
in
metropolitan
areas
of
kansas
on
the
minimum
--
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
provision
for
that
sir.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
the
judgment
is
entered
in
effect
by
confession
and
then
it
is
enforceable
by
the
state
in
a
proceeding.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
the
judgment
is
the
lien
against
--
let
me
approach
that
question
by
answering
this
way.
the
judgment
is
treated
almost
exactly
the
same
as
would
any
judgment
in
the
civil
case.
it
is
to
lien
against
all
property
that
a
civil
judgment
would
operate
against.
the
homestead
exemption
exists,
the
lien
exists
for
five
years
unless
execution
is
issued.
if
execution
is
not
issued
it
becomes
dormant
and
it's
subject
to
reviver
within
a
two-year
period
just
as
are
all
civil
judgments
which
all
are
liens.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
i
think
that
provision
relates
to
the
suit
against
the
person
to
whom
property
has
been
fraudulently
been
transferred.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
otherwise
the
judgment
when
it
is
filed
would
operate
as
a
lien
for
five
years
just
as
--
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
g.
collister,
jr.
i
see
that
my
time
has
run
out.
i
do
not
have
anything
further
to
say.
we
have
tried
in
our
brief.
we
cite
the
authorities
we
found
available
and
the
similar
or
other
statutes
in
other
states
comparable
to
ours.
thank
you.
