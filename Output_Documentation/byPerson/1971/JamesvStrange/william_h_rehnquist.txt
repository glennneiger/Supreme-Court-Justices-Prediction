justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
collister,
does
the
existence
of
this
recoupment
statute
in
kansas
tend
to
reduce
in
anyway
the
type
of
inquiry
or
the
extent
of
inquiry
initially
made
by
the
trial
court
when
a
defendant
claims
to
be
indigent?
does
the
trial
court
feel
free
to
conclude
that
he
is
indigent
without
any
searching
examination
because
of
the
existence
of
the
recoupment
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
not
because
of
the
recoupment
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
man
remains
indigent,
who
is
truly
indigent
the
first
place
remains
indigent
the
judgment
really
does
not
have
much
effect
on
him?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
wilkinson,
does
kansas,
the
state
bar
of
kansas
have
a
recommended
minimum
fee
schedule?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
the
limits
on
the
fees
recoverable
under
this
act
for
represent
indigents
compare
with
the
similar
recommended
fees
in
the
kansas
state
bar?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
your
due
process
contention
and
what
other
notice
should
he
would
have
you
say?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
that
is
simply
a
question
of
knowing
the
substantive
basis
on
which
a
judgment
might
ultimately
be
entered,
is
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
what
if
ever
of
our
cases
ever
held
that
specific
notice
of
subjecting
a
provision
of
a
particular
law
must
be
given
to
an
individual
before
he
could
be
made
subject
to
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
was
a
lien
and
foreclosure,
that
was
an
action
against
a
particular
piece
of
property,
was
it
not
in
walker?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
i
suppose
you
can
in
argument
to
the
three-judge
district
court
though
make
an
argument
that
your
client
has
been
saddled
with
this
$500
judgment
and
it
is
invalid,
the
law
imposing
it
because
it
would
have
a
deterrent
effect
on
other
people
even
though
it
may
not
have
that
on
your
particular
client,
whether
the
court
accepts
that
maybe
something
else,
you
were
standing
there?
