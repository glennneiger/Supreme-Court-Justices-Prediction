asked
the

but
there
hadn't
been
any
judgment
entered
yet?
justice
byron
r.

well
i
know,
but
there
hadn't
been
any
judgment
entered
yet,
although

he
was
suppose
to
pay
it?
justice

did
have
notice,
he

was
--
justice
byron

go
on
--
so
the
three-judge

decided
that
the
case
was
not
before
us.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
this
is
not
the
case
you
presented
to

anyway?
justice

white
you
were
saying
that
he
did
not
know
anything
about
what
the
harm
was
and
that
he
should
not
be
saddled
with
debt
that
he
did
not
know
he
was
going
to
end
with.
