mr.
everette
h.
falk
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
central
issue
of
course
in
this
case
is
whether
these
two
indictments,
the
first
charging
robbery
accomplished
with
a
pistol
and
a
second
charging
robbery
accomplished
with
a
riffle
charges
two
separate
offenses.
if
they
do,
then
of
course,
the
defendant
or
the
petitioner
here
is
entitled
to
his
plea
of
double
jeopardy
if
not,
we
contend
that
he
is
not
entitled
to
his
plea
of
double
jeopardy
and
was
properly
convicted
of
robbery
with
a
riffle.
now,
in
tennessee
as
the
questioning
of
mr.
bowman
has
indicated
where
the
indictment
describes
a
particularity,
the
state
is
required
to
prove
it
with
particularity.
and
where
there
is
a
material
variance
between
the
indictment
and
the
proof,
the
prosecution
can
be
terminated
at
that
point
either
by
a
dismissal
or
by
a
directed
verdict
or
by
a
mistrial.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
that
is
our
position
that
it
is
a
separate
offense
and
that
the
second
indictment
charged
a
different
offense
and
that
the
second
indictment
charging
a
different
offense,
it
would
preclude
the
petitioner
from
prevailing
on
his
plea
of
double
jeopardy.
it
is
our
opinion
that
the
fifth
amendment
through
the
fourteenth
amendment
applicable
at
tennessee
prohibits
successive
prosecutions
only
for
the
same
offense
and
not
necessarily
for
the
same
act.
the
same
offense
is
the
proscription
to
which
the
fifth
amendment
applies
and
incidentally
to
which
the
tennessee
double
jeopardy
constitutional
provision
also
applies.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
we
would
be
in
better
shape
mr.
justice.
i
do
not
think
that
it
would
necessarily
be
controlling
in
this
case.
i
think
that
the
statute
in
tennessee
prescribes,
if
it
carves
out
or
describes
the
offense
of
robbery,
robbery
being
the
forcible
taking
of
property
from
the
person
through
violence
or
through
putting
in
fear.
now
the
deadly
weapon
in
this
case
or
in
any
case
would
be
the
means
by
which
the
person
from
whom
the
property
is
taken
was
put
in
fear.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
it
would
have
been
permissible
and
that
the
state
would
have
been
allowed
to
prove
a
deadly
type
of
weapon
under
--
mr.
everette
h.
falk
a
firearm,
yes
sir.
mr.
justice.
if
however
the
indictment
describes
a
particularity,
the
type
of
deadly
weapon
or
a
type
of
firearm,
then
the
state
is
required
to
prove
that.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
then
tennessee
--
mr.
everette
h.
falk
that
is
right
mr.
justice.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
in
this
case
a
directed
verdict
of
acquittal
in
our
opinion
acquits
the
petitioner
of
the
crime
on
the
basis
of
the
material
variance.
if
the
issue
decided
by
that
directed
verdict
of
acquittal
is
the
issue
which
was
the
subject
of
a
material
variance
to-wit
that
the
petitioner
did
not
rob
this
person
with
a
pistol.
that
is
the
issue
in
our
opinion.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
of
not
having
--
mr.
everette
h.
falk
i
believe
--
mr.
everette
h.
falk
i
believe
your
honor
mr.
justice
that
the
directed
verdict
said
that
he
was
not
guilty
as
charged
in
the
indictment.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
oh!
yes
mr.
justice.
we
--
mr.
everette
h.
falk
the
same
witness
testified
in
both
--
mr.
albright
i
believe,
he
was
the
investigator
for
the
clarksville
police
department
testified
in
both
cases
that
in
the
first
case
--
mr.
everette
h.
falk
i
do
not
believe
it
does.
we
do
not
disagree
with
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
was
placed
in
jeopardy
of
his
first
trial,
we
really
would
have
to
admit
that
that
he
was
in
jeopardy
in
his
first
trial
and
if
this
second
offense
is
the
same
as
the
first
offense
then
--
mr.
everette
h.
falk
oh!
the
riffle
was
not
actually
introduced.
the
testimony
of
mr.
albright,
the
investigator
commenced
and
the
question
was
asked
mr.
albright,
what
type
of
weapon
were
you
looking
for
and
he
said
that
he
was
looking
for
a
22
caliber
riffle.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
well,
i
do
not
believe
the
riffle
was
actually
introduced.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
the
testimony
was
adduced
but
the
rifle
itself
was
never
introduced
in
evidence
at
the
first
trial.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
yes
it
was,
apparently
was
mr.
justice.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
they
have
tried
to
do
that
mr.
justice
but
they
were
not
successful
--
mr.
everette
h.
falk
yes
mr.
justice,
he
did.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
he
tried
and
did
convict
him
of
robbery
with
the
use
of
the
riffle.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
i
do
not
believe
so,
mr.
justice
and
under
on
grounds
that
although
the
state
tried
to
prove
that
he
was
in
the
first
trial
that
he
was
--
had
committed
the
robbery
with
the
riffle,
they
did
not
do
that.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
i
am
not
been
able
to
determine
the
exact
numbers
of
states.
i
believe
that
the
majority
rule
among
the
states
is
toward
a
more
lenient
determination
of
whether
a
variance
is
material.
more
leeway
is
given
in
most
states
i
would
say
than
in
determining
whether
a
variance
is
material
and
in
tennessee.
however,
in
tennessee
i
do
not
know
whether
tennessee
is
the
only
state
or
how
many
states
do
follow
this
rather
“strict”
material
variance
rule
that
tennessee
follows.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
i
believe
that
federal
jeopardy
--
double
jeopardy
standards
are
applicable
to
the
state
of
tennessee
and
--
mr.
everette
h.
falk
yes,
that
is
true.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
well,
the
federal
standards
were
not
applicable
at
the
trial
of
benton
versus
maryland
had
not
been
decided
at
the
trial
of
the
petitioner
but
i
believe
that
this
court
can
use
the
federal
standards
to
--
mr.
everette
h.
falk
yes.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
yes.
that
is
my
understanding
mr.
justice,
that
it
is
retroactive
and
it
is
our
opinion
that
federal
double
jeopardy
standards
are
applicable
--
mr.
everette
h.
falk
that
seems
to
be
the
problem,
yes.
we
contend
that,
we
would
contend
that
although
archaic
that
the
tennessee
rule,
the
strict
rule
with
respect
to
material
variance
actually
protects
the
accuse
in
several
respects,
first,
it
requires
a
state
to
prove
the
allegations
contained
in
the
indictment
that
are
not
surplusage.
it
has
the
advantage
of
identifying
the
crime
with
a
high
degree
of
particularity.
in
that
respect
it
would
minimize
the
chance
that
an
accused
would
receive
an
unjust
conviction.
we
would
also
state
that
it
reduces
the
chance
of
error
in
the
trial
court
of
determining
whether
a
variance
is
material
and
that
it
would
require
the
state
to
prove
the
charges
as
described
in
the
indictment.
so
we
contend
that
while
it
may
not
be
in
the
mainstream
of
the
remainder
of
the
states
of
the
union
that
it
does
has
these
three
or
four
advantages
of
protecting
certain
rights
that
an
accused
may
have.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
yes
sir,
i
am.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
i
think
it
has
a
bearing.
i
believe
it
would
have
more
of
a
bearing
and
a
mistrial
had
been
declared
in
this
case
whether
--
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
trial
judge
abused
and
used
discretion
in
declaring
a
mistrial.
if
a
mistrial
had
been
declared
in
this
case.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
under
tennessee
law,
no.
under
federal
law,
i
would
say
that
the
only
difference
would
be
that
by
directing
a
verdict
of
acquittal
it
would
perhaps
raise
the
issue
of
collateral
estoppel,
the
second
trial
whether
or
not
the
same
issues
were
decided
in
the
first
trial.
a
mistrial
would
not
raise
the
issue
of
collateral
estoppel
but
the
directed
verdict
of
acquittal
would
and
this
is
the
only
difference
that
i
would
see.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
yes
it
would.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
that
is
clear
mr.
justice.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
i
think
a
mistrial
might
have
raised
the
same
issue
--
mr.
everette
h.
falk
because
as
we
concede
he
was
in
jeopardy
at
the
first
trial.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
yes
your
honor.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
it
was
in
jeopardy
of
that.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
that
is
true.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
i
think
that
is
perfectly
clear.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
yes
that
is.
that
is
what
jorn
holds
and
i
think
that
the
possibility
could
have
contended
double
jeopardy
even
though
a
mistrial
had
been
--
even
if
a
mistrial
had
been
declared
under
the
authority
of
jorn.
so
in
summary,
we
would
contend
that
the
variance
was
material
under
tennessee
practice,
it
was
material
under
even
under
the
tennessee’s
interpretation
of
the
robbery
statute
because
it
went
to
the
heart
of
the
means
by
which
the
property
was
taken
from
the
individual
by
violence
and
putting
in
fear.
means
used
to
put
the
victim
in
fear
was
the
deadly
weapon,
in
the
first
indictment,
it
was
described
as
a
pistol
and
the
second
indictment
it
was
described
as
a
22
caliber
riffle.
we
contend
that
this
is
a
material
averment
going
to
right
to
the
heart
of
the
means
by
which
the
person
or
the
victim
was
put
in
fear.
and
therefore
as
a
material
allegation
and
material
environment,
a
variance
between
the
two
would
be
a
material
variance
and
the
same
evidence
would
not
support
both
indictments.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
that
is
a
substance
of
our
position.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
not
as
such,
mr.
justice.
i
do
not
know
of
any
provision
in
tennessee
law
for
a
bill
of
particular
as
such.
as
mr.
bowman
stated
there
is
a
statute
that
does
permit
an
amendment
of
an
indictment
upon
the
consent
of
the
counsel
involved,
the
prosecuting
attorney
and
the
defense
counsel.
in
this
case
according
to
mr.
bowman
who
was
the
defense
counsel
at
the
trial
level,
this
was
not
agreed
to,
he
stated,
i
believe
that
he
will
not
agree
to
this.
so
that
statute
although
available
was
not
utilized
in
this
case.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
there
is
not
procedure
that
i
know
of
for
the
defendant
to
utilize
to
obtain
from
the
state
and
to
require
the
state
to
describe
what
particularity
the
deadly
weapon
used.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
i
believe
it
would
mr.
justice
that
it
would
be
a
valid
indictment
in
tennessee
just
to
allege
that
the
person
was
put
in
fear
through
the
use
of
a
deadly
weapon.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
there
is
a
substantial
body
of
law
in
tennessee
as
to
what
constitutes
a
deadly
weapon.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
well,
i
do
not
know
about
a
crowbar.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
firearms
are
been
held
to
be
deadly
weapons,
it
gets
more
to
the
nature
of
the
way
the
weapon
is
used
when
it
gets
to
the
weapons
that
are
not
traditionally
--
mr.
everette
h.
falk
in
tennessee,
i
do
not
believe
there
is
a
specific
procedure
whereby
he
can
get
that
particular
information.
we
do
have
a
preliminary
hearing
procedure
in
tennessee
now
which
is
required
recently
by
a
statute.
i
do
not
know
of
any
way
that
a
defendant
could
require
the
state
to
allege
with
particularity
of
the
deadly
weapon
used.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
well
this
--
i
do
no
know
why
it
is
done.
i
think
it
is
involved
--
mr.
everette
h.
falk
it
is
a
long
line
of
case
precedent
beginning
back
in
the
early
1800’s
requiring
whether
the
state
alleges
with
particularity
to
prove
a
particularity.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
well,
i
do
not
know.
i
think
that
it
varies
throughout
the
state
between
grand
juries
as
to
how
these
things
are
alleged.
it
is
obvious
in
this
case,
i
think
that
it
was
alleged
with
two
higher
degree
of
particularity.
i
do
not
know
why
it
could
occur
that
it
would
be
alleged
but
not
quite
enough
by
a
degree
of
particularity.
i
think
in
my
opinion
that
a
deadly
weapon
allegation
would
be
sufficient.
i
have
not
seen
such
indictment
returned
in
tennessee.
i
have
not
seen
a
lot
of
them
but
i
have
not
seen
one
that
was
returned
with
this
lower
degree
of
particularity.
most
of
them
alleged
--
mr.
everette
h.
falk
deadly
weapons
to
which
a
gun,
i
think
a
gun
is
the
common
description
of
the
deadly
weapon
where
a
gun
is
used.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
i
do
not
think
that
--
mr.
everette
h.
falk
well,
it
is
our
opinion
that
there
were
--
well,
first
of
all
there
is
not
a
crime
in
tennessee
such
as
armed
robbery
as
such.
it
is
robbery
and
if
a
deadly
weapon
is
used
then
the
statute
provides
for
a
much
greater
punishment
all
the
way
up
to
in
including
the
death
penalty.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
oh!
that
is
the
jury’s
verdict
i
think
stating
armed
robbery
means
that
they
were
found
guilty
of
robbery
accomplished
by
the
use
of
a
deadly
weapon.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
well,
they
did
not
say
that
in
their
verdict.
that
is
true.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
that
that
would
have
been
the
same
verdict,
armed
robbery
or
robbery
accomplished
by
the
deadly
weapon.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
it
does
not
give
me
any
problems,
mr.
justice
because
i
do
not
believe
that
the
verdict
is
required
to
be
that
specific.
i
think
that
since
the
--
what
is
alleged
in
the
indictment
is
the
means
of
putting
the
person
in
fear,
the
means
of
obtaining
his
property
by
force.
this
is
the
essential
ingredient
that
was
alleged
in
the
indictment.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
there
would
be
a
difference,
i
do
not
know
whether
that
difference
would
be
viewed
as
material
or
not.
there
is
a
much
greater
difference
between
a
pistol
and
a
riffle.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
i
believe
we
could
mr.
justice.
they
obviously
are
not
the
same
type
of
weapon.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
well,
i
would
have
to
disagree
with
mr.
justice
on
that.
i
think
that
the
riffle
was
never
introduced
in
evidence
at
the
first
trial
regardless
of
whether
it
was
in
the
courtroom
or
not.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
it
was
the
same
riffle.
it
was,
i
will
have
to
--
from
my
reading
of
the
record
it
was
the
same
riffle.
thank
you.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
central
issue
of
course
in
this
case
is
whether
these
two
indictments,
the
first
charging
robbery
accomplished
with
a
pistol
and
a
second
charging
robbery
accomplished
with
a
riffle
charges
two
separate
offenses.
if
they
do,
then
of
course,
the
defendant
or
the
petitioner
here
is
entitled
to
his
plea
of
double
jeopardy
if
not,
we
contend
that
he
is
not
entitled
to
his
plea
of
double
jeopardy
and
was
properly
convicted
of
robbery
with
a
riffle.
now,
in
tennessee
as
the
questioning
of
mr.
bowman
has
indicated
where
the
indictment
describes
a
particularity,
the
state
is
required
to
prove
it
with
particularity.
and
where
there
is
a
material
variance
between
the
indictment
and
the
proof,
the
prosecution
can
be
terminated
at
that
point
either
by
a
dismissal
or
by
a
directed
verdict
or
by
a
mistrial.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
that
is
our
position
that
it
is
a
separate
offense
and
that
the
second
indictment
charged
a
different
offense
and
that
the
second
indictment
charging
a
different
offense,
it
would
preclude
the
petitioner
from
prevailing
on
his
plea
of
double
jeopardy.
it
is
our
opinion
that
the
fifth
amendment
through
the
fourteenth
amendment
applicable
at
tennessee
prohibits
successive
prosecutions
only
for
the
same
offense
and
not
necessarily
for
the
same
act.
the
same
offense
is
the
proscription
to
which
the
fifth
amendment
applies
and
incidentally
to
which
the
tennessee
double
jeopardy
constitutional
provision
also
applies.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
we
would
be
in
better
shape
mr.
justice.
i
do
not
think
that
it
would
necessarily
be
controlling
in
this
case.
i
think
that
the
statute
in
tennessee
prescribes,
if
it
carves
out
or
describes
the
offense
of
robbery,
robbery
being
the
forcible
taking
of
property
from
the
person
through
violence
or
through
putting
in
fear.
now
the
deadly
weapon
in
this
case
or
in
any
case
would
be
the
means
by
which
the
person
from
whom
the
property
is
taken
was
put
in
fear.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
it
would
have
been
permissible
and
that
the
state
would
have
been
allowed
to
prove
a
deadly
type
of
weapon
under
--
mr.
everette
h.
falk
a
firearm,
yes
sir.
mr.
justice.
if
however
the
indictment
describes
a
particularity,
the
type
of
deadly
weapon
or
a
type
of
firearm,
then
the
state
is
required
to
prove
that.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
then
tennessee
--
mr.
everette
h.
falk
that
is
right
mr.
justice.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
in
this
case
a
directed
verdict
of
acquittal
in
our
opinion
acquits
the
petitioner
of
the
crime
on
the
basis
of
the
material
variance.
if
the
issue
decided
by
that
directed
verdict
of
acquittal
is
the
issue
which
was
the
subject
of
a
material
variance
to-wit
that
the
petitioner
did
not
rob
this
person
with
a
pistol.
that
is
the
issue
in
our
opinion.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
of
not
having
--
mr.
everette
h.
falk
i
believe
--
mr.
everette
h.
falk
i
believe
your
honor
mr.
justice
that
the
directed
verdict
said
that
he
was
not
guilty
as
charged
in
the
indictment.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
oh!
yes
mr.
justice.
we
--
mr.
everette
h.
falk
the
same
witness
testified
in
both
--
mr.
albright
i
believe,
he
was
the
investigator
for
the
clarksville
police
department
testified
in
both
cases
that
in
the
first
case
--
mr.
everette
h.
falk
i
do
not
believe
it
does.
we
do
not
disagree
with
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
was
placed
in
jeopardy
of
his
first
trial,
we
really
would
have
to
admit
that
that
he
was
in
jeopardy
in
his
first
trial
and
if
this
second
offense
is
the
same
as
the
first
offense
then
--
mr.
everette
h.
falk
oh!
the
riffle
was
not
actually
introduced.
the
testimony
of
mr.
albright,
the
investigator
commenced
and
the
question
was
asked
mr.
albright,
what
type
of
weapon
were
you
looking
for
and
he
said
that
he
was
looking
for
a
22
caliber
riffle.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
well,
i
do
not
believe
the
riffle
was
actually
introduced.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
the
testimony
was
adduced
but
the
rifle
itself
was
never
introduced
in
evidence
at
the
first
trial.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
yes
it
was,
apparently
was
mr.
justice.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
they
have
tried
to
do
that
mr.
justice
but
they
were
not
successful
--
mr.
everette
h.
falk
yes
mr.
justice,
he
did.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
he
tried
and
did
convict
him
of
robbery
with
the
use
of
the
riffle.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
i
do
not
believe
so,
mr.
justice
and
under
on
grounds
that
although
the
state
tried
to
prove
that
he
was
in
the
first
trial
that
he
was
--
had
committed
the
robbery
with
the
riffle,
they
did
not
do
that.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
i
am
not
been
able
to
determine
the
exact
numbers
of
states.
i
believe
that
the
majority
rule
among
the
states
is
toward
a
more
lenient
determination
of
whether
a
variance
is
material.
more
leeway
is
given
in
most
states
i
would
say
than
in
determining
whether
a
variance
is
material
and
in
tennessee.
however,
in
tennessee
i
do
not
know
whether
tennessee
is
the
only
state
or
how
many
states
do
follow
this
rather
“strict”
material
variance
rule
that
tennessee
follows.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
i
believe
that
federal
jeopardy
--
double
jeopardy
standards
are
applicable
to
the
state
of
tennessee
and
--
mr.
everette
h.
falk
yes,
that
is
true.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
well,
the
federal
standards
were
not
applicable
at
the
trial
of
benton
versus
maryland
had
not
been
decided
at
the
trial
of
the
petitioner
but
i
believe
that
this
court
can
use
the
federal
standards
to
--
mr.
everette
h.
falk
yes.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
yes.
that
is
my
understanding
mr.
justice,
that
it
is
retroactive
and
it
is
our
opinion
that
federal
double
jeopardy
standards
are
applicable
--
mr.
everette
h.
falk
that
seems
to
be
the
problem,
yes.
we
contend
that,
we
would
contend
that
although
archaic
that
the
tennessee
rule,
the
strict
rule
with
respect
to
material
variance
actually
protects
the
accuse
in
several
respects,
first,
it
requires
a
state
to
prove
the
allegations
contained
in
the
indictment
that
are
not
surplusage.
it
has
the
advantage
of
identifying
the
crime
with
a
high
degree
of
particularity.
in
that
respect
it
would
minimize
the
chance
that
an
accused
would
receive
an
unjust
conviction.
we
would
also
state
that
it
reduces
the
chance
of
error
in
the
trial
court
of
determining
whether
a
variance
is
material
and
that
it
would
require
the
state
to
prove
the
charges
as
described
in
the
indictment.
so
we
contend
that
while
it
may
not
be
in
the
mainstream
of
the
remainder
of
the
states
of
the
union
that
it
does
has
these
three
or
four
advantages
of
protecting
certain
rights
that
an
accused
may
have.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
yes
sir,
i
am.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
i
think
it
has
a
bearing.
i
believe
it
would
have
more
of
a
bearing
and
a
mistrial
had
been
declared
in
this
case
whether
--
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
trial
judge
abused
and
used
discretion
in
declaring
a
mistrial.
if
a
mistrial
had
been
declared
in
this
case.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
under
tennessee
law,
no.
under
federal
law,
i
would
say
that
the
only
difference
would
be
that
by
directing
a
verdict
of
acquittal
it
would
perhaps
raise
the
issue
of
collateral
estoppel,
the
second
trial
whether
or
not
the
same
issues
were
decided
in
the
first
trial.
a
mistrial
would
not
raise
the
issue
of
collateral
estoppel
but
the
directed
verdict
of
acquittal
would
and
this
is
the
only
difference
that
i
would
see.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
yes
it
would.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
that
is
clear
mr.
justice.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
i
think
a
mistrial
might
have
raised
the
same
issue
--
mr.
everette
h.
falk
because
as
we
concede
he
was
in
jeopardy
at
the
first
trial.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
yes
your
honor.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
it
was
in
jeopardy
of
that.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
that
is
true.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
i
think
that
is
perfectly
clear.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
yes
that
is.
that
is
what
jorn
holds
and
i
think
that
the
possibility
could
have
contended
double
jeopardy
even
though
a
mistrial
had
been
--
even
if
a
mistrial
had
been
declared
under
the
authority
of
jorn.
so
in
summary,
we
would
contend
that
the
variance
was
material
under
tennessee
practice,
it
was
material
under
even
under
the
tennessee’s
interpretation
of
the
robbery
statute
because
it
went
to
the
heart
of
the
means
by
which
the
property
was
taken
from
the
individual
by
violence
and
putting
in
fear.
means
used
to
put
the
victim
in
fear
was
the
deadly
weapon,
in
the
first
indictment,
it
was
described
as
a
pistol
and
the
second
indictment
it
was
described
as
a
22
caliber
riffle.
we
contend
that
this
is
a
material
averment
going
to
right
to
the
heart
of
the
means
by
which
the
person
or
the
victim
was
put
in
fear.
and
therefore
as
a
material
allegation
and
material
environment,
a
variance
between
the
two
would
be
a
material
variance
and
the
same
evidence
would
not
support
both
indictments.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
that
is
a
substance
of
our
position.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
not
as
such,
mr.
justice.
i
do
not
know
of
any
provision
in
tennessee
law
for
a
bill
of
particular
as
such.
as
mr.
bowman
stated
there
is
a
statute
that
does
permit
an
amendment
of
an
indictment
upon
the
consent
of
the
counsel
involved,
the
prosecuting
attorney
and
the
defense
counsel.
in
this
case
according
to
mr.
bowman
who
was
the
defense
counsel
at
the
trial
level,
this
was
not
agreed
to,
he
stated,
i
believe
that
he
will
not
agree
to
this.
so
that
statute
although
available
was
not
utilized
in
this
case.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
there
is
not
procedure
that
i
know
of
for
the
defendant
to
utilize
to
obtain
from
the
state
and
to
require
the
state
to
describe
what
particularity
the
deadly
weapon
used.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
i
believe
it
would
mr.
justice
that
it
would
be
a
valid
indictment
in
tennessee
just
to
allege
that
the
person
was
put
in
fear
through
the
use
of
a
deadly
weapon.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
there
is
a
substantial
body
of
law
in
tennessee
as
to
what
constitutes
a
deadly
weapon.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
well,
i
do
not
know
about
a
crowbar.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
firearms
are
been
held
to
be
deadly
weapons,
it
gets
more
to
the
nature
of
the
way
the
weapon
is
used
when
it
gets
to
the
weapons
that
are
not
traditionally
--
mr.
everette
h.
falk
in
tennessee,
i
do
not
believe
there
is
a
specific
procedure
whereby
he
can
get
that
particular
information.
we
do
have
a
preliminary
hearing
procedure
in
tennessee
now
which
is
required
recently
by
a
statute.
i
do
not
know
of
any
way
that
a
defendant
could
require
the
state
to
allege
with
particularity
of
the
deadly
weapon
used.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
well
this
--
i
do
no
know
why
it
is
done.
i
think
it
is
involved
--
mr.
everette
h.
falk
it
is
a
long
line
of
case
precedent
beginning
back
in
the
early
1800’s
requiring
whether
the
state
alleges
with
particularity
to
prove
a
particularity.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
well,
i
do
not
know.
i
think
that
it
varies
throughout
the
state
between
grand
juries
as
to
how
these
things
are
alleged.
it
is
obvious
in
this
case,
i
think
that
it
was
alleged
with
two
higher
degree
of
particularity.
i
do
not
know
why
it
could
occur
that
it
would
be
alleged
but
not
quite
enough
by
a
degree
of
particularity.
i
think
in
my
opinion
that
a
deadly
weapon
allegation
would
be
sufficient.
i
have
not
seen
such
indictment
returned
in
tennessee.
i
have
not
seen
a
lot
of
them
but
i
have
not
seen
one
that
was
returned
with
this
lower
degree
of
particularity.
most
of
them
alleged
--
mr.
everette
h.
falk
deadly
weapons
to
which
a
gun,
i
think
a
gun
is
the
common
description
of
the
deadly
weapon
where
a
gun
is
used.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
i
do
not
think
that
--
mr.
everette
h.
falk
well,
it
is
our
opinion
that
there
were
--
well,
first
of
all
there
is
not
a
crime
in
tennessee
such
as
armed
robbery
as
such.
it
is
robbery
and
if
a
deadly
weapon
is
used
then
the
statute
provides
for
a
much
greater
punishment
all
the
way
up
to
in
including
the
death
penalty.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
oh!
that
is
the
jury’s
verdict
i
think
stating
armed
robbery
means
that
they
were
found
guilty
of
robbery
accomplished
by
the
use
of
a
deadly
weapon.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
well,
they
did
not
say
that
in
their
verdict.
that
is
true.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
that
that
would
have
been
the
same
verdict,
armed
robbery
or
robbery
accomplished
by
the
deadly
weapon.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
it
does
not
give
me
any
problems,
mr.
justice
because
i
do
not
believe
that
the
verdict
is
required
to
be
that
specific.
i
think
that
since
the
--
what
is
alleged
in
the
indictment
is
the
means
of
putting
the
person
in
fear,
the
means
of
obtaining
his
property
by
force.
this
is
the
essential
ingredient
that
was
alleged
in
the
indictment.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
there
would
be
a
difference,
i
do
not
know
whether
that
difference
would
be
viewed
as
material
or
not.
there
is
a
much
greater
difference
between
a
pistol
and
a
riffle.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
i
believe
we
could
mr.
justice.
they
obviously
are
not
the
same
type
of
weapon.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
well,
i
would
have
to
disagree
with
mr.
justice
on
that.
i
think
that
the
riffle
was
never
introduced
in
evidence
at
the
first
trial
regardless
of
whether
it
was
in
the
courtroom
or
not.
mr.
everette
h.
falk
it
was
the
same
riffle.
it
was,
i
will
have
to
--
from
my
reading
of
the
record
it
was
the
same
riffle.
thank
you.
