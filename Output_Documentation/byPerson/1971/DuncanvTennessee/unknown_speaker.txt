mr.
bowman,
under
tennessee
practice,
did
the
state
have
any
remedy
by
way
of
amendment
to
the
indictment
available
at
this
point
or
was
it
stuck
with
the
indictment
as
drawn?
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
--
you
have
told
us
that
you
objected
to
the
idea
of
having
a
jury
return
a
verdict
of
acquittal
on
the
first
indictment?
unknown
speaker
and
does
not
appear
in
the
record,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
--
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
you
had
originally
--
it
was
your
objection
however
that
--
put
this
whole
business
in
motion,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
and
that
--
none
of
this
is
in
the
appendix
that
i
can
find.
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bowman
under
tennessee
practices,
is
it
necessary
to
be
specific
about
the
deadly
weapon?
unknown
speaker
period?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
black
horse
and
white
horse
case
in
tennessee
is
wrongly
decided?
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly
there
is
nothing
in
the
tennessee
statute
that
--
in
the
statutes
now
i
am
talking
about
that
makes
it
an
offense
to
steal
a
white
horse
in
a
quite
a
separate
defense
--
offense
to
steal
a
black
horse,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
that
is
larceny
and
even
if
it
is
value
over
a
certain
amount
that
is
grand
larceny,
if
it
is
under
certain
amount
it
is
petty
larceny.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
is
only
one
offense
i
suppose
covering
larceny,
even
if
grand
or
petty?
unknown
speaker
and
how
about
the
case,
the
brass
and
the
bronze
rollers.
unknown
speaker
but
this
case
--
it
seems
strange
to
people
familiar
with
the
federal
present
federal
practices
and
procedures
in
the
criminal
cases,
we
are
not
to
this,
of
the
tennessee
practice
as
it
is
seems
pretty
archaic
but
it
is
--
as
i
understand
the
tennessee
law
it
is
simply
this,
that
if
as
or
when,
the
state
chooses
to
be
very
specific
in
its
indictment
to
describe
the
horses
are
black
horse
then
if
that
is
a
separate
offense,
that
is
the
only
way
if
these
cases
can
be
understood
at
least
by
me
from
a
charge
that
somebody
stole
a
white
horse.
unknown
speaker
but
then
under
tennessee
practice
and
procedures,
these
then
are
separate
offenses
because
the
prosecutors
or
the
grand
jury
has
chosen
to
make
them
so.
unknown
speaker
regardless
of
what
the
statute
may
say.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
do
not
want
to
push
the
matter
but
surely
there
is
not
a
different
punishment
at
tennessee
for
stealing
a
black
horse
than
there
is
from
stealing
a
white
horse,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
tennessee
law
says.
unknown
speaker
it
seems
very
odd
but
that
is
what
it
says,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
now,
when
you
are
talking
about
these
series
of
cases
mr.
bowman,
you
were
talking
about
tennessee
cases?
unknown
speaker
well,
because,
up
until
that
against
maryland,
decided
in
1969,
tennessee
was
not
obligated
in
any
way
to
follow
the
federal
test
of
double
jeopardy,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
so
those
do
not,
they
were
veterans
so
far
as
tennessee
and
all
goes,
so
we
are
here
involved
about
the
federal
constitutional
issue
and
this
became
a
federal
constitutional
issue
only
after
benton
against
maryland,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
easy
enough
for
the
federal
system,
and
we
know
where
federal
judges
at
least
are
more
less
familiar
with
the
rules
of
practice
and
procedure
and
indictments.
when
we
run
into
this
archaic
tennessee
system
it
becomes
a
little
hard
to
apply
particularly
when
tennessee
seems
to
say
that
if
a
grand
jury
chooses
to
be
specific
in
its
indictment,
then
it
carves
out
that
offense
and
that
offense
only,
a
dark
horse
larceny,
a
black
horse
larceny
and
that
is
a
separate
offense
from
the
white
horse
larceny,
that
is
the
only
thing
that
those
cases
could
mean,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
so
then
they
are
different
offenses
because
the
grand
jury
has
chosen
to
specify
the
offense
makes
it
as
a
distinct
offense.
unknown
speaker
did
you
say
larceny
of
the
horse
of
sam
jones,
then
black
or
white
would
come
under
the
indictment.
unknown
speaker
we
have
a
different
situation.
unknown
speaker
well,
does
not
the
very
fact
that
there
was
a
directed
verdict
of
acquittal
under
the
first
indictment
show
that
in
tennessee
at
least
this
was
a
separate
offense.
having
indicted
him
for
armed
robbery
by
use
of
a
pistol
that
the
grand
jury
carved
out
an
offense
in
tennessee
said,
he
is
not
guilty
of
that
offense
or
else
they
could
not
have
been
a
directed
verdict
of
acquittal,
could
they?
unknown
speaker
under
the
pleading
rules
in
tennessee,
i
gather
that
archaic
as
they
seem
to
be
it
would
have
been
sufficient
for
the
indictment
to
have
alleged
robbery
by
use
of
a
deadly
weapon
to-wit
a
fire
arm,
would
that
have
been?
unknown
speaker
a
firearm--
unknown
speaker
then
tennessee
said
--
unknown
speaker
the
state
has
elected
to
make
that
a
separate
offense
otherwise
there
could
not
have
been
a
directed
verdict
of
acquittal,
could
they?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
effect
of
the
directed
verdict
of
acquittal
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
but
the
verdict
said
we
find
him
not
guilty
of
what?
unknown
speaker
not
guilty
of
violating
the
statute
of
tennessee
which
says
robbery
with
the
use
of
a
deadly
weapon.
unknown
speaker
is
that
what
it
says?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
asked
you
the
same
question
and
mr.
bowman
the
same
riffle
was
used
in
both
cases.
unknown
speaker
the
same
witness
testified?
unknown
speaker
that
does
not
give
you
any
double
jeopardy
problem.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
mr.
falk,
i
gather
that
the
state
concedes
that
we
decide
the
issue
before
us
based
on
federal
double
jeopardy
standards?
unknown
speaker
well
now,
am
i
right
as
to
dates,
i
think
we
decided
benton
which
subjected
to
states
for
federal
jeopardy
standards
on
june
25,
1969.
as
i
understand
it,
the
second
trial
in
the
conviction
was
on
march
19,
1969,
three
months
earlier.
unknown
speaker
did
the
states
still
concede
that
the
federal
standards
apply?
unknown
speaker
but
benton
against
maryland,
it
is
the
principle
of
benton
against
maryland
were
made
fully
retroactive.
unknown
speaker
in
at
least
two
different
cases
that
was
made
explicit,
pearce
against
north
carolina
and
the
--
unknown
speaker
the
question
here
is
not
--
that
federal
double
jeopardy
--
federal
constitutional
guarantee
against
double
jeopardy
is
applicable.
the
problem
in
here
is
the
impact
of
that
standard
with
the
--
what
i
have
referred
to
as
the
archaic
pleading
rules
of
tennessee
and
that
is
what
--
unknown
speaker
mr.
falk,
are
you
familiar
with
the
court's
decision
last
term
in
the
jorn?
unknown
speaker
you
did
not
cite
it
in
your
brief
and
i
think
your
opponent
did
not
cite
it,
do
you
feel
it
has
no
bearing
in
here
at
all?
unknown
speaker
well,
except
clearly
after
the
mistrial
there
and
might
and
might
not
be
problem
under
jorn
but
with
an
acquittal,
it
is
certainly
very
clear
that
he
could
never
again
be
tried
for
the
armed
robbery
with
a
use
of
a
deadly
weapon
to-wit
a
firearm,
to-wit
a
pistol,
is
that
not
clear?
unknown
speaker
if
that
was
a
separate
offense
and
the
acquittal
absolutely
barred
a
subsequent
prosecution
for
that
offense.
that
mistrial
might
be
open
to
such
question.
unknown
speaker
or
might
have,
yes.
unknown
speaker
under
an
indictment,
charging
him
with
armed
robbery
by
use
of
the
22
caliber
pistol,
is
that
not
right?
unknown
speaker
i
believe
he
is
in
jeopardy
of
it.
unknown
speaker
and
having
been
acquitted
to
that
he
could
never
again
be
brought
to
trial
for
that.
unknown
speaker
that
is
clear,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
no
trial
probably
also
true
under
jorn
but
depending
upon
the
--
what
the
genesis
of
the
mistrial
was,
is
that
not
what
jorn
holds?
unknown
speaker
of
course
that
would
be
as
i
have
suggested
earlier
ridiculous
argument
to
make
in
a
federal
system
where
you
can
amend
an
indictment
by
--
practically
way
up
to
the
time
of
verdict
to
conform
to
the
proof.
what
you
are
saying
that
if
tennessee
has
held
that
these
are
separate
offenses
and
that
the
--
and
that
this
court
is
not
entitled
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
federal
constitution
to
require
tennessee
to
amend
its
law
as
to
pleading
and
procedure
in
its
own
state.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
would
that
be
a
sufficient
indictment
as
a
matter
of
tennessee
law,
just
a
deadly
weapon?
unknown
speaker
then
he
could
show
it
was
a
crowbar
or
a
dagger
or
a
kitchen
knife
or
a
machinegun
or
a
shotgun
or
a
pistol
or
a
handgun?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
submit
there
is,
but
to
all
of
those
are
deadly
weapon.
unknown
speaker
well,
anything
else
but
--
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
--
i
guess,
perhaps
i
am
repeating
my
brother
rehnquistâ€™s
question,
what
i
asked
is
there
any
way
that
a
defendant
in
tennessee
charged
under
an
indictment
with
robbery
with
a
use
of
a
deadly
can
get
anything
from
the
prosecution
as
to
what
kind
of
a
deadly
weapon
he
is
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
why
is
it
if
that
would
be
a
sufficient
indictment?
why
is
it
the
facts
of
the
defendant
seem
to
be
so
very,
very
detailed
and
specific,
explicit,
black
horses
and
white
horses,
brass
rollers
and
bronze
rollers,
pistols
and
riffles.
why
is
it
done
as
the
other
would
be
sufficient?
unknown
speaker
can
it
have
it?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
then
why
does
the
state
allege
it
if
it
then
is
locked
in
to
the
duty
of
proving
it,
if
it
does
not
have
to
allege
it.
unknown
speaker
at
least
the
firearms.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
police
chief
or
whatever
the
title
was,
testified
as
to
a
riffle
and
i
am
asking
you
even
though
it
does
not
appear
in
the
record,
was
that
the
same
riffle
that
was
used
in
the
second
trial?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bowman,
under
tennessee
practice,
did
the
state
have
any
remedy
by
way
of
amendment
to
the

unknown
speaker
not
guilty
of
violating
the
statute
of
tennessee
which
says
robbery
with
the
use
of
a
deadly
weapon.
unknown
speaker
is
that
what
it
says?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
asked
you
the
same
question
and
mr.
bowman
the
same
riffle
was
used
in
both
cases.
unknown
speaker
the
same
witness
testified?
unknown
speaker
that
does
not
give
you
any
double
jeopardy
problem.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
mr.
falk,
i
gather
that
the
state
concedes
that
we
decide
the
issue
before
us
based
on
federal
double
jeopardy
standards?
unknown
speaker
well
now,
am
i
right
as
to
dates,
i
think
we
decided
benton
which
subjected
to
states
for
federal
jeopardy
standards
on
june
25,
1969.
as
i
understand
it,
the
second
trial
in
the
conviction
was
on
march
19,
1969,
three
months
earlier.
unknown
speaker
did
the
states
still
concede
that
the
federal
standards
apply?
unknown
speaker
but
benton
against
maryland,
it
is
the
principle
of
benton
against
maryland
were
made
fully
retroactive.
unknown
speaker
in
at
least
two
different
cases
that
was
made
explicit,
pearce
against
north
carolina
and
the
--
unknown
speaker
the
question
here
is
not
--
that
federal
double
jeopardy
--
federal
constitutional
guarantee
against
double
jeopardy
is
applicable.
the
problem
in
here
is
the
impact
of
that
standard
with
the
--
what
i
have
referred
to
as
the
archaic
pleading
rules
of
tennessee
and
that
is
what
--
unknown
speaker
mr.
falk,
are
you
familiar
with
the
court's
decision
last
term
in
the
jorn?
unknown
speaker
you
did
not
cite
it
in
your
brief
and
i
think
your
opponent
did
not
cite
it,
do
you
feel
it
has
no
bearing
in
here
at
all?
unknown
speaker
well,
except
clearly
after
the
mistrial
there
and
might
and
might
not
be
problem
under
jorn
but
with
an
acquittal,
it
is
certainly
very
clear
that
he
could
never
again
be
tried
for
the
armed
robbery
with
a
use
of
a
deadly
weapon
to-wit
a
firearm,
to-wit
a
pistol,
is
that
not
clear?
unknown
speaker
if
that
was
a
separate
offense
and
the
acquittal
absolutely
barred
a
subsequent
prosecution
for
that
offense.
that
mistrial
might
be
open
to
such
question.
unknown
speaker
or
might
have,
yes.
unknown
speaker
under
an
indictment,
charging
him
with
armed
robbery
by
use
of
the
22
caliber
pistol,
is
that
not
right?
unknown
speaker
i
believe
he
is
in
jeopardy
of
it.
unknown
speaker
and
having
been
acquitted
to
that
he
could
never
again
be
brought
to
trial
for
that.
unknown
speaker
that
is
clear,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
no
trial
probably
also
true
under
jorn
but
depending
upon
the
--
what
the
genesis
of
the
mistrial
was,
is
that
not
what
jorn
holds?
unknown
speaker
of
course
that
would
be
as
i
have
suggested
earlier
ridiculous
argument
to
make
in
a
federal
system
where
you
can
amend
an
indictment
by
--
practically
way
up
to
the
time
of
verdict
to
conform
to
the
proof.
what
you
are
saying
that
if
tennessee
has
held
that
these
are
separate
offenses
and
that
the
--
and
that
this
court
is
not
entitled
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
federal
constitution
to
require
tennessee
to
amend
its
law
as
to
pleading
and
procedure
in
its
own
state.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
would
that
be
a
sufficient
indictment
as
a
matter
of
tennessee
law,
just
a
deadly
weapon?
unknown
speaker
then
he
could
show
it
was
a
crowbar
or
a
dagger
or
a
kitchen
knife
or
a
machinegun
or
a
shotgun
or
a
pistol
or
a
handgun?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
submit
there
is,
but
to
all
of
those
are
deadly
weapon.
unknown
speaker
well,
anything
else
but
--
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
--
i
guess,
perhaps
i
am
repeating
my
brother
rehnquistâ€™s
question,
what
i
asked
is
there
any
way
that
a
defendant
in
tennessee
charged
under
an
indictment
with
robbery
with
a
use
of
a
deadly
can
get
anything
from
the
prosecution
as
to
what
kind
of
a
deadly
weapon
he
is
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
why
is
it
if
that
would
be
a
sufficient
indictment?
why
is
it
the
facts
of
the
defendant
seem
to
be
so
very,
very
detailed
and
specific,
explicit,
black
horses
and
white
horses,
brass
rollers
and
bronze
rollers,
pistols
and
riffles.
why
is
it
done
as
the
other
would
be
sufficient?
unknown
speaker
can
it
have
it?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
then
why
does
the
state
allege
it
if
it
then
is
locked
in
to
the
duty
of
proving
it,
if
it
does
not
have
to
allege
it.
unknown
speaker
at
least
the
firearms.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
police
chief
or
whatever
the
title
was,
testified
as
to
a
riffle
and
i
am
asking
you
even
though
it
does
not
appear
in
the
record,
was
that
the
same
riffle
that
was
used
in
the
second
trial?
