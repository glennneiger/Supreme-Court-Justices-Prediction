mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
to-wit
a
gun,
to-wit
a
22
caliber
pistol.
the
matter
proceeded
for
the
trial.
a
jury
was
selected
and
sworn.
the
defendant
entered
his
pleas,
plea
of
not
guilty.
the
state
put
its
first
witness
on
the
stand.
this
first
witness
mr.
kenneth
albright
(ph)
was
asked
what
type
of
gun
were
they
looking
for.
his
answer
was
a
22
caliber
riffle.
to
this,
counsel
for
the
defendant
objected
on
the
basis
that
the
indictment
charged
at
the
robber
was
accomplished
with
the
22
caliber
pistol.
at
the
much
argument
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury,
the
judge
ruled
in
favor
of
counsel
for
the
defendant
and
the
attorney
general
said,
well,
in
this
case,
then
i
think
that
what
ought
to
be
done
is
a
jury
instructed
return
of
verdict
of
not
guilty
and
this
was
done.
the
judge
instructed
the
jury
that
because
of
the
fact
that
there
was
a
mistake
in
the
indictment
that
he
was
instructing
the
jury
to
return
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
for
the
defendant.
then
a
short
time
later,
the
defendants
were
again
indicted
charging
the
same
facts
had
been
charged
in
the
original
indictment,
except
this
time
charging
that
the
robbery
was
accomplished
with
a
deadly
weapon,
to-wit
a
gun,
to-wit
a
22
caliber
riffle,
this
thing
--
the
only
difference
in
the
two
indictments.
through
this
indictment
a
plea
of
double
jeopardy
was
filed
alleging
both
a
violation
of
the
state
of
tennessee
constitutional
provisions
and
united
states
constitutional
provisions.
this
plea
was
overruled
and
the
matter
went
to
trial.
at
the
trial,
for
the
prosecution
it
was
asked,
was
there
any
other
robbery
at
this
service
station
on
this
day
and
the
answer
was
no.
as
a
result
of
this
second
trial,
the
defendant
was
found
guilty.
after
this
occurred,
proper
appeals
were
perfected,
the
tennessee
court
of
criminal
appeals
with
one
judge
dissenting
overruled
the
montgomery
county
criminal
court
and
ordered
the
defendants
released.
the
state
of
tennessee
petitioned
the
tennessee
supreme
court
as
a
result
of
this,
certiorari
was
granted
by
the
tennessee
supreme
court
and
the
tennessee
supreme
court
overruled
the
tennessee
court
of
criminal
appeals.
the
question
involved
is
the
mere
changing
of
the
type
of
weapon
in
this
indictment.
does
this
create
a
different
offense
so
that
the
double
jeopardy
provisions
do
not
apply?
now
there
are
several
tests
that
have
been
applied
over
the
years
to
determine
whether
or
not
double
jeopardy
or
the
double
judge
provisions
of
the
constitutions
apply
and
one
of
these
is
are
they
the
same
offenses.
tennessee’s
armed
robbery
statute
39-3901
sets
out
in
the
common
law
terminology,
i
mean
the
robbery
provisions
just
as
it
would
be
in
the
common
law,
those
things
are
not
necessary.
it
adds
the
punishment
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
but
if
said
robbery
is
accomplished
with
the
use
of
a
deadly
weapon
then
the
punishment
shall
be
such
and
such.
the
tennessee
supreme
court
has
held
that
this
particular
statute
when
the
punishment
was
increased
by
the
legislation
in
1955
for
armed
robbery,
they
did
not
create
a
separate
offense
but
the
only
offense
was
robbery.
now,
back
at
the
original
trial
of
this
case
when
the
attorney
general
asked
that
the
judge
return
a
verdict
or
direct
the
jury
to
return
a
verdict
to
not
guilty,
counsel
for
defendant
objected.
we
felt
that
they
could
go
ahead
and
proceed
because
robbery
was
still
vague
that
they
could
not
prove
a
weapon.
even
if
they
could
not
prove
the
particular
type
of
weapon
that
was
involved.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
there
is
a
statute
in
tennessee,
mr.
justice
that
provides
that
by
agreement
of
counsel,
an
indictment
can
be
amended.
so
that
if
this
had
been
done
--
yes,
the
indictment
could
have
been
amended.
my
thoughts
of
the
matter
were
had
the
attorney
general
said
to
counsel
for
the
defendant
and
i
was
counsel
for
the
defendant
at
that
stage,
let
us
amend
the
indictment
or
if
you
refuse
to
amend
the
indictment
then
i
will
ask
the
judge
to
grant
a
mistrial.
we
may
have
been
in
a
different
situation
but
this
was
not
the
case.
the
attorney
general
said
to
the
court,
well,
are
you
to
go
ahead
in
trial
on
this
one
or
i
will
get
him
--
have
him
re-indicted
and
they
have
chose
to
have
the
request
of
the
judge
to
instruct
the
judge
to
return
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
and
then
did
re-indict
him.
so
there
was
a
procedure
that
it
had
been
taken,
it
had
appeared
it
had
been
followed
but
it
was
not.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
yes
it
does
your
honor
in
the
--
it
is
not
in
the
appendix
but
it
is
in
the
record.
we
did
request
that
the
jury
not
be
instructed
to
return
a
verdict
of
not
guilty,
we
felt
that
this
would
be
a
problem
that
would
arise
in
the
future
if
this
was
done.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
it
appears
in
the
order.
i
am
missing
that
page
that
it
is
on.
it
appears
on
page
5
in
the
judgment
of
the
criminal
court
of
montgomery
county.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
and
i
think
in
there
it
will
state
that
--
i
believe
it
states
in
there,
we
have
objected
but
it
does
appear
in
the
opinion
of
the
criminal
court
of
appeals
in
tennessee,
i
know
and
it
is
in
the
record
that
we
did
object
to
this
being
done.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
your
honor,
to
be
perfectly
frank
with
you,
at
the
time
this
was
tried
originally,
i
had
been
practicing
for
some
5
months
or
6
months
and
i
was
not
even
aware
of
the
statute
that
allowed
an
amendment
of
the
indictment.
i
think
the
record
will
show,
i
state
to
the
court,
i
did
not
know
whether
an
indictment
could
be
amended
or
not
at
that
time.
but
since
i
have
had
time
in
doing
much
research
on
this
case,
of
course
i
have
found
that
there
is
a
statute
which
would
have
allowed
the
indictment
to
be
amended.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
thank
you.
the
particular
law
involved
in
this
case,
there
is
not
any
that
is
directly
in
point,
a
complete
search
of
the
records,
all
i
say
is
complete
as
searches
cannot
be
done
because
i
have
been
able
to
do
has
not
rebuild
the
case
that
is
directly
in
point
with
the
fact
situation
in
this
case.
there
are
cases
which
hold
that
is
not
double
jeopardy
to
indict
a
man
the
second
time
where
the
item
stolen,
we
will
say
is
described
improperly,
such
in
one
case
where
the
serial
number
of
an
automobile
was
misstated
in
the
indictment.
this
cases
which
all
that
if
you
indicted
for
stealing
a
white
horse,
you
cannot
be
convicted
for
stealing
a
black
horse
and
to
be
indicted
for
stealing
a
black
horse
then
is
not
double
jeopardy.
but
each
of
these
cases
involved
a
particular
thing
stolen,
the
description
of
a
necessary
element
of
the
offense.
in
this
case,
the
second
indictment,
it
charges
that
$70.00
was
taken
from
the
person
of
johnny
brant(ph).
the
property
of
the
reda
(ph)
service
station
exactly
the
same
thing
as
these
are
charged
in
the
first
indictment.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
your
honor,
from
winning
the
cases
in
tennessee,
i
think
it
would
have
been
sufficient
for
the
indictment
to
have
merely
stated,
said,
robbery
accomplished
with
the
use
of
a
deadly
weapon.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
period.
to
go
a
little
bit
further,
they
have
said
it
was
done
with
a
gun
but
it
was
not
necessary
to
specifically
describe
the
weapon
used.
this
was
just
a
matter
of
--
that
was
added
to
make
it
more
particular.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
yes
your
honor.
that
was
the
position.
of
course
it
was
our
position
at
the
time
that
a
conviction
for
robbery
which
is
the
only
offense
under
tennessee
law
could
have
still
been
obtained
even
if
they
had
not
been
able
to
prove
the
type
of
weapon
or
prove
that
there
was
a
deadly
weapon
used
and
of
course
it
is
our
contention
that
the
acquittal
or
the
original
indictment
acquitted
the
defendant
of
the
very
crime
of
robbery,
of
the
very
crime
of
taking
$70.00
from
the
person
of
johnny
brant(ph)
being
the
part
of
the
reda
(ph)
service
station.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
no
your
honor.
i
can
distinguish.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
no,
mr.
justice
but
i
think
--
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
yes.
but
now
if
i
was
charged
with
doing
that
and
stealing
your
automobile
and
it
turned
out
that
it
was
mr.
chief
justice’s
automobile
that
i
had
stolen.
the
first
indictment
charges
would
be
dismissed
on
that.
i
could
be
indicted
on
the
second
one
because
of
the
fact
that
i
did
steal
that
particular
automobile.
there
are
two
separate
offenses
committed
there.
in
this
particular
situation
under
the
inspection
of
the
tennessee
robbery
statute
there
is
only
one
offense
in
tennessee
and
that
is
robbery.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
right
your
honor.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
in
the
brass
and
bronze
roller
case,
a
mistrial
was
granted
and
they
were
re-indicted
after
the
mistrial.
there
was
not
a
directed
verdict
of
acquittal
in
that
particular
case.
and
i
am
not
satisfied
particularly
if
that
case
is
right.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
yes
sir,
mr.
justice.
but
what
i
am
saying
though
is
the
fact
that
you
described
a
horse
a
different
way,
you
are
describing
a
particular
element
of
the
offense
differently
and
that
element
of
the
offense
is
describing
that
thing
stolen,
the
larceny
committed
in
the
armed
robbery
statute.
you
are
not
describing
a
necessary
element
of
the
offense
differently
at
anytime
because
in
the
tennessee
statute
whether
a
deadly
weapon
is
used
or
not
only
goes
to
the
punishment,
not
to
a
description
of
the
offense
whatsoever.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
no
your
honor.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
there
is
not,
there
would
be
the
same
thing
but
you
would
have
stolen
if
you
would
have
committed
an
entirely
different
offense
by
stealing
the
black
horse
than
you
would
be
stealing
a
white
horse
--
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
that
is
right.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
that
is
right.
and
i
--
of
course,
it
was
my
interpretation
of
federal
law
that
you
would
have
the
same
problem
in
the
--
i
think
it
is
a
green
case
where
a
man
was
indicted
in
the
federal
court
and
charged
with
stealing
an
automobile,
the
serial
number
was
listed
and
it
turned
out
that
the
serial
number
was
wrong.
the
federal
courts
there
held
that
he
could
be
re-indicted
and
retried
and
the
double
jeopardy
provision
would
not
apply.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
yes
your
honor.
i
think,
it
has
been
a
while
that
i
stated,
i
didn't
think
that
the
indictment
could
be
amended.
i
were
--
at
that
time
i
was
not
aware
of
a
particular
statute
involved.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
there
is
a
statute
dealing
with
deadly
weapons
and
a
22
caliber
pistol,
caliber
pistol
would
definitely
be
illegal
to
carry
around.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
there
is
some
case
law
in
tennessee
which
holds
that
it
is
not
illegal
to
carry
a
riffle
per
se
but
it
would
be
to
carry
a
pistol.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
we
have
no
special
permits
in
tennessee.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
if
you
came
with
the
intent
to
go
on
and
the
presumption
of
that
is
as
far
as
a
handgun,
if
you
got
it
on
your
possession
and
loaded
that
you
can
with
intent
to
go
on,
a
riffle,
the
presumption
does
not
arise
with
--
neither
does
not
arise
with
the
shotgun
because
people
go
hunting.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
no
your
honor.
i
do
not
because
the
statute
charged
with
a
deadly
weapon
and
of
course
even
under
the
deadly
weapon
statute
in
tennessee
if
it
can
be
shown
the
presumption
is
if
you
carry
a
handgun
it
is
with
intent
to
go
on
but
it
can
be
also
with
a
riffle
where
it
was
used
for
the
purpose
of
going
on
which
is
why
i
did
use
the
weapon
to
shoot
at
somebody
or
to
holdup
a
service
station.
it
gets
stand
and
in
fact.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
yes.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
i
think
the
same
questions
would
have
been
raised
all
the
way
up
the
line,
and
mr.
justice
if
there
had
not
been
an
acquittal
as
it
has
been
now.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
it
had
never
was
even
mentioned
that
the
proceedings
are
well
on
it.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
mr.
justice,
not
that
i
know
of.
no,
it
is
possible
that
there
is
but
i
do
not
know
of
any.
what
would
have
been
the
situation
if
this
man
had
walked
in
with
a
22
caliber
pistol
at
one
hand
and
a
22
caliber
riffle
in
the
other
hand?
i
did
have
to
say
that
this
court
and
no
other
court
would
allow
a
prosecution
to
the
stand
for
armed
robbery
with
a
pistol
then
for
prosecution
involving
robbery
with
the
riffle.
the
question
of
being
2
separate
offenses,
i
do
not
thing
it
would
arise
under
those
circumstances.
but
when
you
are
applying
to
the
facts
as
we
have
here
that
is
exactly
what
is
trying
to
be
done.
i
am
trying
t
o
make
they
have
tried
to
make
two
separate
offenses
by
clearly
changing
the
weapon.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
yes
sir.
at
tennessee
as
applied
over
the
years,
the
same
offense
test
and
there
has
been
cases
in
tennessee
as
far
back
as
the
early
1800s,
hite
versus
state
which
made
the
distinguishment
between
where
a
banknote
was
stolen
and
payable
to
one
bank,
may
was
indicted
on
it
and
acquitted,
as
it
turned
out
the
bank
that
was
payable
at
the
other
bank
and
they
re-indicted
him
and
court
said
this
was
not
double
jeopardy.
well,
here
again
it
would
be
just
like
if
the
first
time,
they
had
said
he
had
stolen
the
property
of
mr.
chief
justice
and
the
second
time
he
had
stolen
the
property
of
another
one
of
the
justices.
so,
the
tennessee
says
that
this
is
not,
those
two
cases
are
not
the
same
offense.
of
course
it
is
our
contention
that
the
robbery,
the
basic
thing
of
this,
basic
element
of
this
crime
is
the
same
offense
in
both
cases.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
yes.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
no.
mr.
justice
under
tennessee
law
for
armed
robbery,
you
can
be
given
the
death
sentence
for
any
time
less
to
a
minimum
of
ten
years.
for
simple
robbery
and
i
maybe
mistaken
as
to
what
punishment
is,
i
believe
it
is
3
to
10
years.
the
punishment
would
have
been
affected
by
not
being
able
to
have
proven
the
gun.
this
was
the
big
thing
to
increase
the
punishment
was
the
purpose
in
alleging
the
gun
but
there
would
have
been
nothing
that
would
have
kept
you
from
going
on
improving
the
simple
robbery
and
the
only
robbery
involved
here
and
that
was
the
robbery
of
the
service
station.
now
the
test
had
been
applied,
have
been
the
same
evidence
and
the
same
offense
test.
and
you
read
the
cases
over
the
years
and
it
is
really
hard
in
lots
of
those
cases
to
determine
what
is
being
held,
but
in
most
of
the
same
offense
tests,
it
is
talking
about
the
white
and
the
black
horse.
a
bank
no
payable
at
the
mechanic’s
bank
instead
of
the
merchant’s
bank,
a
car
bearing
the
wrong
serial
number
as
compared
to
the
car
having
the
right
serial
number.
brass
and
bronze
roller
things
and
so
forth
on
down
the
line.
but
each
of
these
cases
deals
with
a
substantive
matter
of
that
indictment,
substantive
matter
of
that
particular,
would
it
be
common
law
or
statutory
crime.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
tennessee
cases
and
federal
cases,
mr.
justice.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
no
your
honor.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
yes.
the
federal
courts
have
applied
and
have
constitutionally
held,
as
i
have
held
that
it
is
constitutionally
proper
to
apply
the
same
offense
test
and
there
has
been
cases
even
recently
in
the
various
circuits
holding
that
this
is
a
proper
test
to
determine
the
double
jeopardy
provisions.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
i
think
you
are
right,
mr.
justice.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
that
is
right.
if
they
would
have
said
larceny
of
the
horse
--
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
that
is
right
but
if
they
said
larceny
of
the
horse
of
sam
jones
and
it
turned
out
that
to
be
by
marshals
because
we
have
a
different
situation
--
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
when
you
look
at
the
facts
in
the
situation
and
the
various
opinions
in
the
particular
case
then
i
feel
that
the
--
if
whatever
test
you
would
apply,
either
be
the
same
evidence
or
the
same
offense,
you
are
going
to
find
that
this
is
the
same
frame
in
all
situations
that
the
robbery
was
the
only
crime
that
was
committed
under
tennessee
law
and
that
applying
this
into
the
standards
set
forth
by
this
court
that
this
is
double
jeopardy.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
it
could
have
been
shown
as
the
indictments
simply
said
--
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
yes
chief
justice.
it
would
have
been
required
that
a
different
type
of
weapon
be
proven
rather
than
--
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
your
question
as
i
understand
it
has
skipped
--
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
the
pistol
was
the
first
indictment
and
the
riffle
was
the
second
indictment.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
at
the
riffle
indictment
could
they
have
made
a
case
showing
use
of
pistol?
i
do
not
think
so
but
i
do
not
know.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
pardon
me?
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
yes.
it
is
a
same
weapon,
both
times.
there
was
not
two
weapons
used
in
the
commission
of
this
crime,
was
only
one.
thank
you.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
i
just
like
to
add
that
an
approval
of
this
practice
would
allow
an
attorney
general
from
the
state
of
tennessee
to
indict
a
man
for
armed
robbery
knowing
that
he
was
alleging
the
wrong
type
of
weapon.
try
and
have
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
to
return,
again
indict
him,
again
alleging
the
wrong
type
of
weapon,
again
tried
and
so
forth
on
down
the
line.
the
attorney
general
stated
in
the
first
trial
of
this
and
it
is
in
the
record,
i
made
a
mistake
in
the
indictment.
now,
an
approval
would
allow
him
to
make
a
mistake
and
trial
a
man
over
and
over
and
over
again
until
he
finally
decided
to
allege
in
the
indictment
or
have
the
grand
jury
return
an
indictment
with
the
right
type
of
weapon.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
to-wit
a
gun,
to-wit
a
22
caliber
pistol.
the
matter
proceeded
for
the
trial.
a
jury
was
selected
and
sworn.
the
defendant
entered
his
pleas,
plea
of
not
guilty.
the
state
put
its
first
witness
on
the
stand.
this
first
witness
mr.
kenneth
albright
(ph)
was
asked
what
type
of
gun
were
they
looking
for.
his
answer
was
a
22
caliber
riffle.
to
this,
counsel
for
the
defendant
objected
on
the
basis
that
the
indictment
charged
at
the
robber
was
accomplished
with
the
22
caliber
pistol.
at
the
much
argument
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury,
the
judge
ruled
in
favor
of
counsel
for
the
defendant
and
the
attorney
general
said,
well,
in
this
case,
then
i
think
that
what
ought
to
be
done
is
a
jury
instructed
return
of
verdict
of
not
guilty
and
this
was
done.
the
judge
instructed
the
jury
that
because
of
the
fact
that
there
was
a
mistake
in
the
indictment
that
he
was
instructing
the
jury
to
return
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
for
the
defendant.
then
a
short
time
later,
the
defendants
were
again
indicted
charging
the
same
facts
had
been
charged
in
the
original
indictment,
except
this
time
charging
that
the
robbery
was
accomplished
with
a
deadly
weapon,
to-wit
a
gun,
to-wit
a
22
caliber
riffle,
this
thing
--
the
only
difference
in
the
two
indictments.
through
this
indictment
a
plea
of
double
jeopardy
was
filed
alleging
both
a
violation
of
the
state
of
tennessee
constitutional
provisions
and
united
states
constitutional
provisions.
this
plea
was
overruled
and
the
matter
went
to
trial.
at
the
trial,
for
the
prosecution
it
was
asked,
was
there
any
other
robbery
at
this
service
station
on
this
day
and
the
answer
was
no.
as
a
result
of
this
second
trial,
the
defendant
was
found
guilty.
after
this
occurred,
proper
appeals
were
perfected,
the
tennessee
court
of
criminal
appeals
with
one
judge
dissenting
overruled
the
montgomery
county
criminal
court
and
ordered
the
defendants
released.
the
state
of
tennessee
petitioned
the
tennessee
supreme
court
as
a
result
of
this,
certiorari
was
granted
by
the
tennessee
supreme
court
and
the
tennessee
supreme
court
overruled
the
tennessee
court
of
criminal
appeals.
the
question
involved
is
the
mere
changing
of
the
type
of
weapon
in
this
indictment.
does
this
create
a
different
offense
so
that
the
double
jeopardy
provisions
do
not
apply?
now
there
are
several
tests
that
have
been
applied
over
the
years
to
determine
whether
or
not
double
jeopardy
or
the
double
judge
provisions
of
the
constitutions
apply
and
one
of
these
is
are
they
the
same
offenses.
tennessee’s
armed
robbery
statute
39-3901
sets
out
in
the
common
law
terminology,
i
mean
the
robbery
provisions
just
as
it
would
be
in
the
common
law,
those
things
are
not
necessary.
it
adds
the
punishment
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
but
if
said
robbery
is
accomplished
with
the
use
of
a
deadly
weapon
then
the
punishment
shall
be
such
and
such.
the
tennessee
supreme
court
has
held
that
this
particular
statute
when
the
punishment
was
increased
by
the
legislation
in
1955
for
armed
robbery,
they
did
not
create
a
separate
offense
but
the
only
offense
was
robbery.
now,
back
at
the
original
trial
of
this
case
when
the
attorney
general
asked
that
the
judge
return
a
verdict
or
direct
the
jury
to
return
a
verdict
to
not
guilty,
counsel
for
defendant
objected.
we
felt
that
they
could
go
ahead
and
proceed
because
robbery
was
still
vague
that
they
could
not
prove
a
weapon.
even
if
they
could
not
prove
the
particular
type
of
weapon
that
was
involved.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
there
is
a
statute
in
tennessee,
mr.
justice
that
provides
that
by
agreement
of
counsel,
an
indictment
can
be
amended.
so
that
if
this
had
been
done
--
yes,
the
indictment
could
have
been
amended.
my
thoughts
of
the
matter
were
had
the
attorney
general
said
to
counsel
for
the
defendant
and
i
was
counsel
for
the
defendant
at
that
stage,
let
us
amend
the
indictment
or
if
you
refuse
to
amend
the
indictment
then
i
will
ask
the
judge
to
grant
a
mistrial.
we
may
have
been
in
a
different
situation
but
this
was
not
the
case.
the
attorney
general
said
to
the
court,
well,
are
you
to
go
ahead
in
trial
on
this
one
or
i
will
get
him
--
have
him
re-indicted
and
they
have
chose
to
have
the
request
of
the
judge
to
instruct
the
judge
to
return
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
and
then
did
re-indict
him.
so
there
was
a
procedure
that
it
had
been
taken,
it
had
appeared
it
had
been
followed
but
it
was
not.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
yes
it
does
your
honor
in
the
--
it
is
not
in
the
appendix
but
it
is
in
the
record.
we
did
request
that
the
jury
not
be
instructed
to
return
a
verdict
of
not
guilty,
we
felt
that
this
would
be
a
problem
that
would
arise
in
the
future
if
this
was
done.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
it
appears
in
the
order.
i
am
missing
that
page
that
it
is
on.
it
appears
on
page
5
in
the
judgment
of
the
criminal
court
of
montgomery
county.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
and
i
think
in
there
it
will
state
that
--
i
believe
it
states
in
there,
we
have
objected
but
it
does
appear
in
the
opinion
of
the
criminal
court
of
appeals
in
tennessee,
i
know
and
it
is
in
the
record
that
we
did
object
to
this
being
done.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
your
honor,
to
be
perfectly
frank
with
you,
at
the
time
this
was
tried
originally,
i
had
been
practicing
for
some
5
months
or
6
months
and
i
was
not
even
aware
of
the
statute
that
allowed
an
amendment
of
the
indictment.
i
think
the
record
will
show,
i
state
to
the
court,
i
did
not
know
whether
an
indictment
could
be
amended
or
not
at
that
time.
but
since
i
have
had
time
in
doing
much
research
on
this
case,
of
course
i
have
found
that
there
is
a
statute
which
would
have
allowed
the
indictment
to
be
amended.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
thank
you.
the
particular
law
involved
in
this
case,
there
is
not
any
that
is
directly
in
point,
a
complete
search
of
the
records,
all
i
say
is
complete
as
searches
cannot
be
done
because
i
have
been
able
to
do
has
not
rebuild
the
case
that
is
directly
in
point
with
the
fact
situation
in
this
case.
there
are
cases
which
hold
that
is
not
double
jeopardy
to
indict
a
man
the
second
time
where
the
item
stolen,
we
will
say
is
described
improperly,
such
in
one
case
where
the
serial
number
of
an
automobile
was
misstated
in
the
indictment.
this
cases
which
all
that
if
you
indicted
for
stealing
a
white
horse,
you
cannot
be
convicted
for
stealing
a
black
horse
and
to
be
indicted
for
stealing
a
black
horse
then
is
not
double
jeopardy.
but
each
of
these
cases
involved
a
particular
thing
stolen,
the
description
of
a
necessary
element
of
the
offense.
in
this
case,
the
second
indictment,
it
charges
that
$70.00
was
taken
from
the
person
of
johnny
brant(ph).
the
property
of
the
reda
(ph)
service
station
exactly
the
same
thing
as
these
are
charged
in
the
first
indictment.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
your
honor,
from
winning
the
cases
in
tennessee,
i
think
it
would
have
been
sufficient
for
the
indictment
to
have
merely
stated,
said,
robbery
accomplished
with
the
use
of
a
deadly
weapon.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
period.
to
go
a
little
bit
further,
they
have
said
it
was
done
with
a
gun
but
it
was
not
necessary
to
specifically
describe
the
weapon
used.
this
was
just
a
matter
of
--
that
was
added
to
make
it
more
particular.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
yes
your
honor.
that
was
the
position.
of
course
it
was
our
position
at
the
time
that
a
conviction
for
robbery
which
is
the
only
offense
under
tennessee
law
could
have
still
been
obtained
even
if
they
had
not
been
able
to
prove
the
type
of
weapon
or
prove
that
there
was
a
deadly
weapon
used
and
of
course
it
is
our
contention
that
the
acquittal
or
the
original
indictment
acquitted
the
defendant
of
the
very
crime
of
robbery,
of
the
very
crime
of
taking
$70.00
from
the
person
of
johnny
brant(ph)
being
the
part
of
the
reda
(ph)
service
station.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
no
your
honor.
i
can
distinguish.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
no,
mr.
justice
but
i
think
--
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
yes.
but
now
if
i
was
charged
with
doing
that
and
stealing
your
automobile
and
it
turned
out
that
it
was
mr.
chief
justice’s
automobile
that
i
had
stolen.
the
first
indictment
charges
would
be
dismissed
on
that.
i
could
be
indicted
on
the
second
one
because
of
the
fact
that
i
did
steal
that
particular
automobile.
there
are
two
separate
offenses
committed
there.
in
this
particular
situation
under
the
inspection
of
the
tennessee
robbery
statute
there
is
only
one
offense
in
tennessee
and
that
is
robbery.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
right
your
honor.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
in
the
brass
and
bronze
roller
case,
a
mistrial
was
granted
and
they
were
re-indicted
after
the
mistrial.
there
was
not
a
directed
verdict
of
acquittal
in
that
particular
case.
and
i
am
not
satisfied
particularly
if
that
case
is
right.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
yes
sir,
mr.
justice.
but
what
i
am
saying
though
is
the
fact
that
you
described
a
horse
a
different
way,
you
are
describing
a
particular
element
of
the
offense
differently
and
that
element
of
the
offense
is
describing
that
thing
stolen,
the
larceny
committed
in
the
armed
robbery
statute.
you
are
not
describing
a
necessary
element
of
the
offense
differently
at
anytime
because
in
the
tennessee
statute
whether
a
deadly
weapon
is
used
or
not
only
goes
to
the
punishment,
not
to
a
description
of
the
offense
whatsoever.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
no
your
honor.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
there
is
not,
there
would
be
the
same
thing
but
you
would
have
stolen
if
you
would
have
committed
an
entirely
different
offense
by
stealing
the
black
horse
than
you
would
be
stealing
a
white
horse
--
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
that
is
right.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
that
is
right.
and
i
--
of
course,
it
was
my
interpretation
of
federal
law
that
you
would
have
the
same
problem
in
the
--
i
think
it
is
a
green
case
where
a
man
was
indicted
in
the
federal
court
and
charged
with
stealing
an
automobile,
the
serial
number
was
listed
and
it
turned
out
that
the
serial
number
was
wrong.
the
federal
courts
there
held
that
he
could
be
re-indicted
and
retried
and
the
double
jeopardy
provision
would
not
apply.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
yes
your
honor.
i
think,
it
has
been
a
while
that
i
stated,
i
didn't
think
that
the
indictment
could
be
amended.
i
were
--
at
that
time
i
was
not
aware
of
a
particular
statute
involved.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
there
is
a
statute
dealing
with
deadly
weapons
and
a
22
caliber
pistol,
caliber
pistol
would
definitely
be
illegal
to
carry
around.
mr.
rodger
n.

there
is
some
case
law
in
tennessee
which
holds
that
it
is
not
illegal
to
carry
a
riffle
per
se
but
it
would
be
to
carry
a
pistol.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
we
have
no
special
permits
in
tennessee.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
if
you
came
with
the
intent
to
go
on
and
the
presumption
of
that
is
as
far
as
a
handgun,
if
you
got
it
on
your
possession
and
loaded
that
you
can
with
intent
to
go
on,
a
riffle,
the
presumption
does
not
arise
with
--
neither
does
not
arise
with
the
shotgun
because
people
go
hunting.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
no
your
honor.
i
do
not
because
the
statute
charged
with
a
deadly
weapon
and
of
course
even
under
the
deadly
weapon
statute
in
tennessee
if
it
can
be
shown
the
presumption
is
if
you
carry
a
handgun
it
is
with
intent
to
go
on
but
it
can
be
also
with
a
riffle
where
it
was
used
for
the
purpose
of
going
on
which
is
why
i
did
use
the
weapon
to
shoot
at
somebody
or
to
holdup
a
service
station.
it
gets
stand
and
in
fact.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
yes.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
i
think
the
same
questions
would
have
been
raised
all
the
way
up
the
line,
and
mr.
justice
if
there
had
not
been
an
acquittal
as
it
has
been
now.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
it
had
never
was
even
mentioned
that
the
proceedings
are
well
on
it.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
mr.
justice,
not
that
i
know
of.
no,
it
is
possible
that
there
is
but
i
do
not
know
of
any.
what
would
have
been
the
situation
if
this
man
had
walked
in
with
a
22
caliber
pistol
at
one
hand
and
a
22
caliber
riffle
in
the
other
hand?
i
did
have
to
say
that
this
court
and
no
other
court
would
allow
a
prosecution
to
the
stand
for
armed
robbery
with
a
pistol
then
for
prosecution
involving
robbery
with
the
riffle.
the
question
of
being
2
separate
offenses,
i
do
not
thing
it
would
arise
under
those
circumstances.
but
when
you
are
applying
to
the
facts
as
we
have
here
that
is
exactly
what
is
trying
to
be
done.
i
am
trying
t
o
make
they
have
tried
to
make
two
separate
offenses
by
clearly
changing
the
weapon.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
yes
sir.
at
tennessee
as
applied
over
the
years,
the
same
offense
test
and
there
has
been
cases
in
tennessee
as
far
back
as
the
early
1800s,
hite
versus
state
which
made
the
distinguishment
between
where
a
banknote
was
stolen
and
payable
to
one
bank,
may
was
indicted
on
it
and
acquitted,
as
it
turned
out
the
bank
that
was
payable
at
the
other
bank
and
they
re-indicted
him
and
court
said
this
was
not
double
jeopardy.
well,
here
again
it
would
be
just
like
if
the
first
time,
they
had
said
he
had
stolen
the
property
of
mr.
chief
justice
and
the
second
time
he
had
stolen
the
property
of
another
one
of
the
justices.
so,
the
tennessee
says
that
this
is
not,
those
two
cases
are
not
the
same
offense.
of
course
it
is
our
contention
that
the
robbery,
the
basic
thing
of
this,
basic
element
of
this
crime
is
the
same
offense
in
both
cases.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
yes.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
no.
mr.
justice
under
tennessee
law
for
armed
robbery,
you
can
be
given
the
death
sentence
for
any
time
less
to
a
minimum
of
ten
years.
for
simple
robbery
and
i
maybe
mistaken
as
to
what
punishment
is,
i
believe
it
is
3
to
10
years.
the
punishment
would
have
been
affected
by
not
being
able
to
have
proven
the
gun.
this
was
the
big
thing
to
increase
the
punishment
was
the
purpose
in
alleging
the
gun
but
there
would
have
been
nothing
that
would
have
kept
you
from
going
on
improving
the
simple
robbery
and
the
only
robbery
involved
here
and
that
was
the
robbery
of
the
service
station.
now
the
test
had
been
applied,
have
been
the
same
evidence
and
the
same
offense
test.
and
you
read
the
cases
over
the
years
and
it
is
really
hard
in
lots
of
those
cases
to
determine
what
is
being
held,
but
in
most
of
the
same
offense
tests,
it
is
talking
about
the
white
and
the
black
horse.
a
bank
no
payable
at
the
mechanic’s
bank
instead
of
the
merchant’s
bank,
a
car
bearing
the
wrong
serial
number
as
compared
to
the
car
having
the
right
serial
number.
brass
and
bronze
roller
things
and
so
forth
on
down
the
line.
but
each
of
these
cases
deals
with
a
substantive
matter
of
that
indictment,
substantive
matter
of
that
particular,
would
it
be
common
law
or
statutory
crime.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
tennessee
cases
and
federal
cases,
mr.
justice.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
no
your
honor.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
yes.
the
federal
courts
have
applied
and
have
constitutionally
held,
as
i
have
held
that
it
is
constitutionally
proper
to
apply
the
same
offense
test
and
there
has
been
cases
even
recently
in
the
various
circuits
holding
that
this
is
a
proper
test
to
determine
the
double
jeopardy
provisions.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
i
think
you
are
right,
mr.
justice.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
that
is
right.
if
they
would
have
said
larceny
of
the
horse
--
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
that
is
right
but
if
they
said
larceny
of
the
horse
of
sam
jones
and
it
turned
out
that
to
be
by
marshals
because
we
have
a
different
situation
--
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
when
you
look
at
the
facts
in
the
situation
and
the
various
opinions
in
the
particular
case
then
i
feel
that
the
--
if
whatever
test
you
would
apply,
either
be
the
same
evidence
or
the
same
offense,
you
are
going
to
find
that
this
is
the
same
frame
in
all
situations
that
the
robbery
was
the
only
crime
that
was
committed
under
tennessee
law
and
that
applying
this
into
the
standards
set
forth
by
this
court
that
this
is
double
jeopardy.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
it
could
have
been
shown
as
the
indictments
simply
said
--
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
yes
chief
justice.
it
would
have
been
required
that
a
different
type
of
weapon
be
proven
rather
than
--
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
your
question
as
i
understand
it
has
skipped
--
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
the
pistol
was
the
first
indictment
and
the
riffle
was
the
second
indictment.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
at
the
riffle
indictment
could
they
have
made
a
case
showing
use
of
pistol?
i
do
not
think
so
but
i
do
not
know.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
pardon
me?
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
yes.
it
is
a
same
weapon,
both
times.
there
was
not
two
weapons
used
in
the
commission
of
this
crime,
was
only
one.
thank
you.
mr.
rodger
n.
bowman
i
just
like
to
add
that
an
approval
of
this
practice
would
allow
an
attorney
general
from
the
state
of
tennessee
to
indict
a
man
for
armed
robbery
knowing
that
he
was
alleging
the
wrong
type
of
weapon.
try
and
have
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
to
return,
again
indict
him,
again
alleging
the
wrong
type
of
weapon,
again
tried
and
so
forth
on
down
the
line.
the
attorney
general
stated
in
the
first
trial
of
this
and
it
is
in
the
record,
i
made
a
mistake
in
the
indictment.
now,
an
approval
would
allow
him
to
make
a
mistake
and
trial
a
man
over
and
over
and
over
again
until
he
finally
decided
to
allege
in
the
indictment
or
have
the
grand
jury
return
an
indictment
with
the
right
type
of
weapon.
