court
was
that

on

it

with
the

mr.

justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
moment
ago
in
your
argument,
you
said
that
you
thought
the
state
could
have
proceeded
not
withstanding
the
trial
judge’s
exclusion
of
the
gun
for
a
simple
prosecution
for
robbery,
would
that
have
carried
a
severe
or
maximum
penalty
as
if
they
had
been
able
to
introduce
evidence
of
the
gun?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
there
any
practical
difference
as
to
result
between
directing
a
verdict
of
acquittal
at
this
stage
of
the
trial
and
having
a
mistrial
under
tennessee
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
the
practical
consequences
are
the
same,
it
would
be
unusual
if
federal
law
would
provide
for
a
different
outcome
and
one
in
and
in
the
other,
would
it
not?
justice

mr.
falk,
does
tennessee
criminal
practice
recognize
a
bill
of
particulars
--
can
a
defendant
demand
the
bill
of
particulars?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
suppose
in
the
indictment
alleges
are
armed
robbery
with
a
deadly
weapon
without
specifying
the
deadly
weapon.
the
defendant
does
not
have
any
pretrial
mechanism
available
to
demand
from
the
state
what
deadly
weapon
are
you
charging
that
i
