e.

mr.
bowman,
i
take
it
from
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
you
are
unwilling
to
agree
to
an
amendment
of
the
indictment.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
not
suggesting
by
any
means
that
you
should
have
consented
that
was
a
matter
for
your
choice
as
an
advocate.
perhaps
even
without
knowing
the
statute
to
may
have
made
the
correct
choice.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
bowman,
in
tennessee
is
it
lawful
to
carry
a
22
riffle
around,
is
there
any
inhibition
on
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
what
i
am
trying
to
get
at.
is
there
a
difference
in
the
legality
of
walking
down
the
street
with
a
22
riffle
as
against
a
pistol
in
your
pocket?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
would
have
to
have
a
license
to
carry
the
pistol,
special
permit
of
some
kind?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
handguns
are
illegal
in
tennessee?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
do
you
think
that
this
is
a
substantive
difference
then
that
one
offense
charged
here
was
with
a
gun
which
is
legal
to
possess
and
the
other
one,
a
pistol
which
is
illegal
to
posses.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
bowman
you
have
not
mentioned
one
of
the
tests
in
some
of
the
cases
and
the
evaluating
double
jeopardy
and
that
is
whether
it
is
the
same
evidence
is
involved.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
to
show
that
it
was
larceny
committed
with
a
dangerous
weapon,
the
evidence
is
not
the
same,
is
it?
chief

warren
e.
burger
well,
we

to
the

of
the
dangerous
weapon
from
what
it
was
and
would
have
been
in
the
first
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
could
not
have
established
the
second
--
the
case
under
the
second
indictment
from
which
you
say
of
tennessee
law
by
showing
a
kind
of
a
weapon
and
not
described
in
the
indictment,
could
you?
chief

warren
e.

--
chief

warren
e.

well,
after
the
trial
on
the
riffle
indictment,

he
used
a
pistol?
chief

warren
e.
burger
mr.
falk.
chief

warren
e.
burger
but
did
he
--
chief
