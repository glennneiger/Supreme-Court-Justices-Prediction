mr.
bowman,
if
you
would
back
a
minute,
you
did
after
the
refuse
to
permit
the
indictment
could
be
amended.
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
no
way
for
the
counsel
to
agree
to
amend
the
indictment
that
is
what
you
have
said.
justice
thurgood

mr.

(voice

justice
thurgood
marshall
in
tennessee
what
is
the
difficulty
in
mistrial?
is
there
a
difference
between
mistrial
and
acquittal
in
tennessee?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any
reason
why
this
could
have
been
declared
a
mistrial
rather
than
an
acquittal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
was
not
discussed,
the
mistrial
point
was
never
discussed
as
i
read
the
record.
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
is
there
any
peculiar
rule
in
tennessee
that
makes
that
necessary?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
that
one
show
that
that
the
same
riffle
was
used
in
both
the
charges,
the
exact
same
riffle?
justice
thurgood
marshall
exact
same
riffle
was
in
both
charge?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
you
not
be
in
better
shape
if
you
had
two
statutes
one
for
robbery
with
a
riffle
and
one
for
robbery
with
a
pistol
which
you
do
not
have.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
was
put
in
jeopardy
of
armed
robbery
with
a
rifle,
i
submit
because
the
state
introduced
the
riffle
in
the
crime.
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
22
caliber
riffle
was
in
the
courtroom
in
view
of
the
jury
so
say
at
this
record
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
was
it
not
in
the
courtroom.
did
it
not
mr.
bowman
make
a
motion
to
get
it
out
in
view
of
the
jury,
i
am
reading
right
here,
he
made
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
why
it
was
in
the
courtroom.
so
the
state
through
the
attorney
general
proceeded
to
try
this
man
for
a
robbery
by
use
of
a
riffle,
is
that
correct?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
did
try
it,
did
he
not?
he
tried
it.
he
tried
to
convict
him
of
using
that
riffle.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
did
he
do
in
the
second
trial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
with
the
riffle.
and
you
do
not
have
any
double
jeopardy
problem.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
falk,
what
significance
is
the
finding
of
the
second
jury
that
they
say
upon
their
oath
that
they
find
the
defendant's
name
in
the
guilty
of
armed
robbery,
but
they
did
not
use
the
word
riffle
or
pistol
either
way.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
not
all
one
crime,
is
that
not
the
crime
that
they
were
charged
within
both
cases,
armed
robbery.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
they
were
found
guilty
of
armed
robbery.
it
is
what
the
jury’s
verdict
was.
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
22
riffle.
you
did
not
go
that
far,
did
you
not?
in
your
answer
you
did
not
go
that
far.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
if
they
have
been
tried
with
the
other
one,
they
were
brought
in
the
same
verdict.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
said
that
was
not
a
problem
because
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
they
are
both
the
same?
was
there
any
difference
between
a
32
and
a
45
pistol?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
he
was
found
not
guilty
of
robbery
with
a
22,
could
you
indict
him
a
crime
for
armed
robbery
with
a
45?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
used
the
same
pistol
as
evidence?
they
used
the
same
riffle
for
both
of
these
cases.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.

if
you
