mr.
john
j.
cleary
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
response
to
one
of
the
questions
earlier
put
the
requirement,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court,
in
1896
code
section
1357
(a)
(1).
it
deals
with
the
right
of
an
immigration
officer
to
interrogate
any
person,
any
alien,
or
any
person
believed
to
be
an
alien
concerning
his
citizenship.
there
is
not
the
next
step
to
the
next
as
said,
because
there
is
another
statute
requiring
this
individual
to
carry
his
alien
registration
with
the
card
that
he
might
been
produce
the
card.
there
are
three
separate
statutory
sections,
on
the
problems
confronting
the
defendant
in
this
case
which
of
course,
he
felt,
was
not
need
to
be
raised,
it
is
possibly
to
discriminatory
inherent
defect
within
the
statute
which
means
to
say
that
anyone
could
be
inquired
or
interrogated
in
this
fashion.
in
this
case,
the
defendant
contends
that
the
interrogation
conducted
in
this
case,
under
these
circumstances
call
for
the
application
of
fifth
amendment.
he
would
even
contend
that
it
is
even
stronger
than
miranda
because
of
the
circumstances
involved
in
the
nature
of
the
interrogation.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
government's
exhibit
one,
for
identification
was
hos
forged
card.
i
think
they
used
a
social
security
card,
i
am
not
sure.
they
also
introduced
a
statement
of
mrs.
diana
barbette
garcia,
concerning
her
statement
requesting
another
card
because
she
lost
the
card
in
a
court,
we
have
asserted
that
this
is
taken
(inaudible)
in
the
violation
of
his
confrontation,
introduced
the
statements
of
another
person.
those
two
items
were
an
essence
to
(inaudible)
mr.
john
j.
cleary
several;
first
the
actual
knowledgeable
possession
and
that
was
manifested
by,
show
me
proof
of
citizenship
or
upon
the
second
interrogation,
produce
your
card.
it
was
no
longer
a
proof
was
the
term
he
asked
the
first
time,
second
time,
produce
your
card.
so
by
producing
a
card
he
would
then
portray
a
verbal
act
that
he
had
knowledgeable
possession
of
that
card.
one
of
the
elements
of
the
offense
is
his
knowledgeable
possession.
two;
the
card
itself,
in
the
result
the
actual
production
of
the
card,
turning
over
the
card
was
introduced
in
evidence
against,
those
were
the
items
that
incriminated.
in
other
words,
there
was
a
combination
of
both
a
physical
and
a
verbal
act.
there
was
also
a
statement
on
this
man
that
he
was
and
acknowledged
the
card
and
there
was
one
confession
i
was
able
to
knock
out
on
the
ground
that
volunteer
mr.
mcmeller
(ph)
rule
and
the
district
court
did
grant
that,
but
they
let
in
another
one,
an
earlier
statement
to
the
authority.
at
this
time
was
neither
the
court,
i
would
like
to
ask
permission
to
be
able
to
cite
two
additional
authorities
concerning
my
case.
the
first
one
deals
with,
a
court
of
military
appeals
and
that
is,
u.s.
versus
nowling,
9
united
states
court
of
military
appeals,
100,
1958,
and
the
other
court
case
i
would
like
to
cite
and
that
is
on
the
issues
one
and
two
dealing
with
fifth
amendment
and
the
production
of
the
card,
an
item,
4
(c),
requirement
of
defense
counsel
be
allowed
to
interview
witnesses
before
they
are
deported
as
affective
assistance
to
counsel,
i
would
cite
to
the
court
an
--
it
was
not
in
the
f
2nd
reporter
yet,
u.s.
versus
linda
rodriguez,
ninth
circuit,
number
71,
1238,
dated,
13,
july
1971.
the
--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
u.s.
versus
nowling
and
--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
9
u.s.c.m.a.
100.
that
case
dealt
with
almost
head
on
with
this
type
of
situation
that
we
have
here
in
the
sense
that
and
the
courts
below,
the
lower
court
certainly
not
binding
on
this
court,
it
was
where
an
air
force
policeman
thought
that
an
airman
did
not
have
a
proper
pass,
a
required
document
possibly
by
the
military
service.
he
went
up
and
he
--
thinking
that
he
might
possibly
not
have
an
appropriate
pass,
he
said,
produce
your
pass.
the
man
produced
the
pass
and
the
court
held
that
this
was
in
violation
of
article
31
of
uniform
code
of
military
justice
which
is
the
precursor
through
the
miranda
position
on
the
warning
it
must
given
to
servicemen.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
well,
that
is
a
question
that
i
would
not
be
able
to
really
respond
to
your
honor.
the
question
of
the
interrogation
in
this
case,
one
has
to
take
a
look
at
the
total
circumstances.
this
was
task
force
group
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service.
this
is
a
sweep
type
of
a
procedure
whereby
they
apprehend
certain
aliens.
it
is
brought
out
in
the
transcript
that
they
knew
of
people
that
they
had
planned
to
apprehend.
they
apprehended
them
and
then
extended
to
them
the
courtesy
of
securing
their
own
their
clothes.
in
this
case,
there
was
an
entry
made
into
the
apartment
the
first
time.
that
time
the
authority
of
the
officer
was
present
and
it
was,
demanded
up
to
defendant
and
say,
produce
proof
of
your
citizenship.
he
complied,
a
certain
production
was
made
at
that
time.
thereafter
they
left.
when
they
left
they
arrested
another
one
on
the
street,
another
alien
as
they
determined
because
this
man
now
had
a
forged
card.
the
other
had
none.
with
this
knowledge
the
agents
most
candidly
stated
for
the
record
that
i
now
thought
that
the
other
man
when
he
entered
the
apartment
had
a
forged
card.
he
had
that
knowledge.
he
then,
going
back
into
the
apartment,
entered
the
apartment
again
for
the
alleged
purpose
of
securing
clothes
of
their
prisoner.
but
it
is
our
contention
of
course,
and
it
is
stated
in
the
brief
that
this
one
is
beyond
the
legitimate
ambit
of
their
entry
into
the
apartment
and
then
interrogated
this
defendant
with
the
express
design
of
producing
that
which
would
incriminate.
the
court
of
appeals
felt
that
this
was
the
equivalent
of
making
a
man
produce
varied
evidence
of
his
guilt
which
in
fact
was
not
clearly
demonstrated
in
this
case.
these
are
the
circumstances
that
was
trigger,
if
at
all,
the
application
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
required
records
document
as
really
initiated
and
formulated
in
shapiro
deals
with
the
quite
different
situation.
in
that
case,
there
was
business
record.
in
this
case
we
have
a
personal
card
belonging
to
the
individual.
the
shapiro
case
was
further
refined
in
the
language
of
justice
harlan
in
marchetti
and
he
sets
out
certain
requirements.
the
third
one
is
the
key
requirement
and
that
is
the
requirements
dealing
with
the
albertson
rule
and
that
is
to
say,
when
it
focuses
in
on
certain
suspect
class.
our
contention
is
not
even
a
class,
it
is
an
individual,
one
defendant
and
when
that
class
cannot
be
penalized,
and
here
the
penalty
is
most
obvious.
in
miranda,
the
man
only
gave
a
statement
of
complicity.
in
miranda
he
did
give
evidence
of
his
guilt
or
his
statement
leading
to
evidence.
in
this
case
it
was
the
whole
act
was
the
admission
of
guilt.
if
there
is
some
relationship
in
the
intensity
that
would
require
for
the
interplay
of
the
fifth
amendment
especially
when
here
the
status
of
the
agent
is
greatly
enhanced.
for
example,
if
they
were
suspecting
of
him
some
ordinary
criminal
offense,
he
could
not
so
interrogate
him.
with
this
case
they
cannot
ask
if
he
has
the
the
citizenship.
they
can
ask
anyone
and
it
is
a
more
a
possibly
a
danger
when
you
have
a
man
who
is
from
a
foreign
land,
does
not
speak
our
language,
would
not
necessarily
be
in
the
likeness
to
our
laws
or
as
to
his
right
to
resist
if
at
all.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
your
honor,
you
are
touching
upon
a
matter
that
was
just
briefly
hit
upon
on
the
record
and
since
i
served
as
defense
counsel
at
trial,
i
have
done
my
utmost
to
secure
a
deportation
order
for
the
defendant
and
in
the
nature
of
plea
bargaining
had
foreclosed
the
charge
with
the
court
in
presence
of
the
us
attorney
and
almost
literally
begged
for
a
misdemeanor
violation
under
8
u.s.c.
1325.
the
immigration
was
adamant.
their
general
contention
was
yet
fooled
in
ifs
and
as
agent
on
the
first
time,
by
the
first
go
around
and
hence
they
would
import
what
i
felt
was
draconian
penalty.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
he
was
arrested
for
a
forged
card.
however
--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
yes,
it
appears
in
the
characterization
of
judge
lynch,
where
judge
lynch
said
at
the
time
you
arrested
him,
you
did
have
him
for
the
forged
card,
was
the
violation
of
title
xviii
and
their
contention
was,
the
immigration
contention
was,
well,
we
had
him
for
that,
but
really
we
do
not
have
to
do
anything
with
the
minor
rule
5
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
because
we
have
him
administratively
and
we
do
not
need
to
bring
him
before
a
magistrate.
judge
lynch
discounted
that
and
said
no,
when
you
have
him
for
a
federal
crime
you
must
comply
the
rule
5
and
bring
him
before
a
magistrate.
he
was
not
brought
before
a
magistrate
but
was
held
a
month
until
counsel
was
appointed
and
one
of
the
arguments
we
have
laid
before
in
the
trial
court
and
court
of
appeals
and
again
before
this
court,
is
the
delay
in
the
appointment
of
counsel.
the
nature
of
the
interrogation
here
was
unique.
it
was
in
the
man’s
home.
the
status
of
the
investigator
has
been
clearly
demonstrated
by
the
counsel
for
the
--
solicitor
general
has
indicated
that
they
stated
their
purpose
while
they
were
in
there.
they
readily
had
apprehended
two
of
his
roommates
and
it
demonstrated
their
power
to
seize
and
apprehend
persons.
the
critical
point
that
we
try
to
raise
is
that
trying
to
understand
what
the
fifth
amendment
was
trying
to
do
and
that
is
the
spirit.
here,
we
have
light
years
of
different
between
an
alien
from
a
different
country,
on
foreign
soil,
unfamiliar
with
the
laws,
unfamiliar
with
the
language
dealing
with
the
federal
investigator’s
experience
bi-lingual,
knowledgeable
on
his
own
home
ground.
there
was
no
place
that
was
safe
from
this
immigration
examination
or
question.
and
somewhere
along
the
line,
the
fifth
amendment
protects
this
type
of
conduct.
we
contend
that
the
circumstances
here
are
far
more
coercive
and
far
more
detrimental
than
those
existing
in
miranda.
if
anything,
we
would
try
to
draw
upon
the
analogy
in
orozco
versus
texas
indicates
that
the
fifth
amendment
should
be
applied
not
in
terms
of
a
geographical
study
but
in
terms
of
a
right
or
privacy
of
the
individual.
if
there
is
some
zone
or
right
of
the
individual
to
be
protected
and
that
right
to
be
protected
against
self
incrimination
should
not
depend
upon
whether
he
is
in
a
jail
house
or
in
his
flat.
but
a
fortiori
that
being
in
his
own
flat,
he
was
entitled
to
some
deference
by
the
immigration
agents.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
no
sir.
that
--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
the
purpose
of
the
card,
your
honor
is
that,
it
is
a
form
of
identification
in
several
respects.
it
can
--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
i
would
have
to
say
that
it
is
for
a
mutual
benefit
that
of
the
government
and
that
of
the
individual.
for
example,
if
the
man
was
an
alien,
and
asked
to
produce
some
evidence,
they
only
show
may
be
a
passport
or
birth
certificate,
that
is
not
legitimate
authority
to
have
it
here
in
the
united
state
lawfully.
so
hence,
he
would
have
to
maybe
check
with
the
ins
or
something
like
this.
the
card
would
give
him
that
advantage.
the
benefit
of
the
government
of
course
is
to
regulate
the
aliens
which
was
the
very
basis
of
the
act
when
it
was
passed,
i
believe
in
1941.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
primary
purpose
is
to
really
identify
and
provide
a
means
of
authority.
the
contention
of
the
defendant
would
be
that
congress
have
to
fulcrum
on
his
head
and
the
question
is
the
card
is
there,
that
congress
felt
that
it
was
appropriate
for
them
to
produce
the
card
and
i
think
it
should
have
made
a
legislation
to
that
effect.
there
is
no
such
legislation.
in
fact
in
the
same
way
that
the
man
could
have
produced
other
evidence,
i
am
sure
that
would
have
been
satisfactory,
but
this
is
a
convenient
form
to
show
a
person’s
legitimate
data.
i
think
the
point
made
by
justice
douglas
and
that
is
considered
by
the
defendant
such
is
upon
the
matters
that
when
the
inquiry
went
into
the
second
time
what
it
was
dealing
with
was
a
legitimate
alien
registration
receipt
card.
it
was
dealing
with
a
piece
of,
for
lack
for
a
better
term,
contraband
or
evidence
that
would
be
able
to
prove
guilt.
at
that
time,
this
assignment
was
required
to
produce
that
evidence.
and
it
was
no
longer
using
which
we
go
along
with
and
we
did
argue
with
the
court
of
appeals,
now
we
assert
in
this
court
that
the
government
could
not
make
general
interrogation.
sullivan
versus
the
united
states
attacked
the
right
to
make
general
neutral
inquiry.
i
think
it
is
totally
permissible,
and
i
think
that
is
wholly
within
--
inconsistent
with
the
fifth
amendment
but
to
focus
in
on
this
type
of
defendant,
i
think
it
transcends
that
and
the
government
should
not
be
able
to
do
as
a
bootstrap,
statutory
right
to
make
interrogations
in
justifying
the
constitution.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
your
honor,
that
i
cannot
--
that
argument
was
not
reached
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
contention
was
duel.
we
had
made
the
contention
that
interrogation
had
gone
beyond
the
legitimate
scope
of
the
entry,
that
is
one
of
the
additional
argument
in
support
of
our
position
and
my
contention
is
that
the
basic
inquiry,
even
conducted
out
in
the
street,
given
these
circumstances,
the
agent
walking
up,
thinking
that
the
man
has
a
forged
card
and
then
he
asked
him
to
produce
it
under
the
semblance
of
his
authority,
i
still
feel
would
violate
the
fifth
amendment.
however,
it
is
our
contention
that
this
circumstance
is
greatly
aggravated
by
the
fact
that
it
took
place
within
the
man’s
own
apartment.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
that
most
difficult
situation
be
--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
the
--
i
think
one
has
to
look
at
the
nature
of
the
intrusion
if
--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
the
intrusion
is
into
his
apartment
concerning
the
way
he
gave
--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
one
would
--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
the
--
no
matter
how
one
might
try
characterize
a,
so
to
speak
little
chat
with
the
immigration
officer,
i
would
dare
say
that
it
would
be
somewhat
coercive,
the
only
case
i
can
think
of
is
california
supreme
court
decision,
where
a
woman
was
asked
to
come
down
and
speak
to
a
friendly
da
about
the
case
and
the
court
held
that
that
was
coercive.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
well,
your
honor
i
would
dare
say
that
my
experience
of
the
immigration,
i
find
them
to
be
more
of
the
most
fiercest
and
enthusiastic
enforcement
of
the
law
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
j.
cleary
your
honor,
i
would
have
to
say
yes
in
the
absence
of
a
statute
that
requires
compulsory
production.
i
think
the
answer
lies
here
very
simply
that
the
agents
thought
that
they
had
probable
cause
that
he
had
a
bad
card,
they
could
have
seized
him
having
probable
cause
for
a
valid
arrest
and
then
taken
the
card
from
him
and
then
they
would
have
had
him.
on
the
other
ground,
even
in
the
office
i
feel
that
absent
a
statute
or
absent
some
regulatory
scheme
to
require
a
production
that
the
fifth
amendment
would
protect
him
from
the
situation.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
no,
your
honor.
the
man
with
the
legitimate
card
has
the
same
exact
right
because
there
is
no
statute.
however,
if
he
was
interrogated,
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
as
a
matter
of
convenience,
he
might
wish
to
show
the
card
and
thereby
end
the
interrogation
as
authorized
under
the
statute.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
well,
that
is
something
that
we
do
not
know,
but
that
in
some
circumstances,
if
it
was
a
voluntary
situation,
if
it
was
one
where
a
man
could
be
shown
that
he
had,
so
to
speak,
knowingly
and
understandingly
try
to
perpetrate
some
type
of
fraud
on
the
government
agent
then
i
think
we
might
run
into
some
probable
waiver
of
fifth
amendment.
no
such
evidence
is
present
in
this
record.
all
we
have
is
a
demand
of
the
agent
and
a
demand
for
the
card.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
the
purpose
of
the
card
is
to
identify
those
in
the
united
states
who
are
aliens,
lawfully
admitted
as
immigrants,
that
is
to
say
on
a
more
public
relations
(voice
overlap).
mr.
john
j.
cleary
the
reasons
where
it
got
far
--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
there
is
also
other
reasons.
i
would
have
to
say
that
there
are
cases
where
a
man
might
not
even
have
an
alien
registration
receipt
card,
but
might
have
some
lawful
status
within
the
united
states.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
in
that
respect
(voice
overlap).
mr.
john
j.
cleary
well,
i
think
it
is
also
for
the
government’s
benefit.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
he
does
have
to
show
it
unless
he
wants
to.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
the
required
record,
yes,
that
there
will
no
fifth
amendment
claim.
i
believe
justice
frankfurter
covered
the
point
far
more
adequately
than
i
thought
in
his
dissenting
opinion
and
also
one
comment
thereby
another
one
of
the
dissenting
judge,
i
think
it
was
in
wilson,
which
i
cited
in
my
brief
which
pointed
out
that,
i
think
it
was
--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
no
sir.
i
am
just
saying
that
there
was
a
concurring
or
dissenting
opinion
in
shapiro
where
the
judge
said
that
this
case
now
applies
to
business
records.
however,
it
can
be
put
to
its
extreme
in
our
experience
that
given
the
type
of
opportunities
on
statutes.
it
can
be
pushed
to
its
limits.
what
i
am
saying
in
this
case
is
it
has
been
pushed
to
the
limit
that
it
is
far
beyond
the
business
record
designed
to
be
ensure
--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
well,
i
would
take
yes,
definitely,
that
difference,
i
think
i
have
made
a
statement
earlier
that
this
is
not
the
regular
inquiry
for
a
card.
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
contraband
item
in
that
--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
what
is
that
--?
mr.
john
j.
cleary
that
is
right.
again
the
logical
extreme.
if
i
could
comment
briefly
on
the
contentions
we
made
concerning
an
equal
important
point,
but
a
jurisdictional
point,
touched
upon
by
justice
stewart
and
that
is
the
application
of
18
u.s.c.
1546
to
an
alien’s
registration
receipt
card.
the
card
here
serves
as
some
type
of
entry
document,
but
the
document
is
a
re-entry
document.
on
the
card
there
was
a
back
portion
where
aliens
living
the
country
and
re-enter
with
the
alien
registration
receipt
card.
the
contention
made
here
is
that
the
statute
does
not
cover
this
particular
card.
the
first
one
is
that
entry
is
distinguishable
from
re-entry
and
to
the
court
we
cite
the
precedent
of
this
court
in
(inaudible)
case
as
interpreted
by
the
mcfarland,
a
second
circuit’s
opinion.
second
point
that
we
make
is
the
regulatory
characterization
of
the
card
by
the
immigration
authority.
there
was
a
two
categorization,
registration
card
and
evidence
of
registration.
this
card
is
secured
within
30
days
after
entry
into
the
united
states,
not
at
entry.
that
is
our
contention
that
the
ambit
and
scope
of
1546
was
directed
at
those
who
would
put
forward
some
type
of
legal
documentation
to
indicate
lawful
status
in
the
united
states.
that
is
to
say,
false
birth
certificates
or
other
items
to
give
him
the
aura
of
legitimacy
within
the
united
states
that
this
was
not
the
intent
of
congress.
further
it
can
be
easily
reviewed
by
taking
a
look
at
the
regulatory
scheme,
as
justice
marshall
first
defined
it
early
and
that
is
that
there
is
a
scheme
of
removal
of
those
unlawfully
in
the
united
states
who
misconstrue
the,
so
to
speak,
poem
on
the
statute
of
liberty,
who
look
for
a
better
land
as
in
this
case,
this
defendant.
and
that
at
first
is
a
voluntary
return,
no
deportation
necessary,
a
person
can
be
returned
with
government
funds
or
without
government
funds
to
mexico.
two,
deportation,
three,
unlawful
entry
under
8
u.s.c.
1325,
first
offense,
$500.00,
six
months,
second
offense,
two
years,
$1,000.00,
next
step
will
be
9
1326.
the
person
who
has
been
deported
unlawfully
returns,
two
years,
$2,000.00.
then
moving
on,
to
the
more
serious
ones,
1546
and
we
have
the
five
years
and
then
1306
(c)
and
that
is
the
one
who
counterfeits
the
alien
registration
receipt
card.
the
further
point
is
that
within
the
statute
we
have
a
patent
in
consideration
and
that
is
that
in
the
second
paragraph
of
1546,
there
are
set
forth
a
statute
to
deal
with
the
counterfeiting
of
documents
required,
for
instance,
in
1306
of
title
viii
(d),
there
is
also
a
like
provision
dealing
with
counterfeiting
but
this
time
specifically
dealing
with
alien
registration
receipt
card.
this
counterfeiting
provision
does
not
meet
our
situation
where
we
have
only
possession,
but
it
is
submitted
by
the
defendant
that
if
a
specific
statute
deals
with
alien
registration
receipt
card
as
others
in
the
document
required
for
entry
and
that
both
of
this
statutes
were
enacted
as
part
of
the
same
package
legislation,
immigration
nationality
act,
therefore,
given
affect
for
both
statutory
sections
there
is
an
inconsistency.
applying
the
principle
of
legacy
,
i
think
the
only
answer
is
that
that
this
type
of
violation
and
it
is
treated
that
way
in
most
ordinary
cases
even
aggravated
cases
is
no
more
than
a
misdemeanor
under
8
u.s.c.
1325.
the
other
arguments
contended
by
respondent
in
this
case
dealt
with
the
cert
and
that
was
the
aggravating
statute
upon
the
entry
into
the
premise
under
the
excerpts
of
the
united
states,
the
fourth
amendment
protection
is
not
complete.
and
that
here,
there
can
be
no
showing
that
the
defendant
who
consented
to
this
type
of
interrogation
even
though
the
agent
might
have
the
right
to
conduct
that
interrogation
on
the
street
or
at
their
office,
their
going
into
his
own
home,
there
is
no
showing
of
that.
they
gained
access
by
the
use
of
the
other
of
his
other
prisoners
to
pick
your
clothing
that
did
not
give
him,
the
agent
the
right
to
conduct
this
type
of
criminal
inquiry.
the
hearsay
rule
was
a
statement
of
ms.
diana
varga.
we
do
not
take,
so
to
speak,
opposition
to
the
public
record
exception
which
the
solicitor
general
wishes
to
contend.
we
contend
that
if
the
statement
by
the
selective
service
file
or
other
public
documents
made
by
the
public
official,
they
can
come
in
as
a
traditional
exception
for
the
hearsay
rule.
however,
what
we
do
take
exception
with
is,
when
there
is
a
statement
of
a
witness
which
is
made
and
then
becomes
a
part
of
the
file
and
then
the
file
is
introduced,
not
much
the
whole
file,
but
that
statement
is
introduced
and
there
is
no
showing
of
unavailability
of
the
witness,
we
contend
that
that
denies
the
right
of
confrontation.
further,
the
question
of
defense
counsel,
we
were
--
i
was
appointed
in
this
case,
i
think
approximately
four
days
after
the
two
witnesses,
the
last
as
to
which
has
been
deported
back
to
mexico
beyond
the
reach
of
any
type
of
subpoena.
in
my
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment,
i
alleged
this
prejudicial
delay
because
here
counsel
was
unable
to
effectively
prepare
this
case
by
interrogating
two
key
witnesses
who
would
have
very
definite
information
as
to
the
circumstances
surrounding
their
consent
to
the
ins
agents
to
enter
the
apartment.
the
government
cite,
u.s.
versus
coleman
in
the
reply
brief
which
i
reviewed
on
the
tuesday,
but
in
reading
that
case,
one
can
see
that
it
is
totally
distinguishable
because
counsel
in
that
case
was
appointed
or
re-countered
his
appearance
in
august,
the
man
was
not
deported
until
the
following
january.
in
this
case,
my
appointment
followed
the
deportation.
two,
in
the
coleman
case
their
was
no
showing
that
the
prosecution
was
aware
of
the
transportation.
here,
the
prosecutor
was
present
in
court
when
the
court
ordered
remanded
linda
mendez
for
the
ins
for
deportation.
but
i
say
that
in
this
case,
it
was
prejudicial,
it
was
not
speculative
because
it
deals
as
one
of
the
essential
issues
here
in
a
sense.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
your
honor,
i
served
as
a
member
of
the
federal
defendant
panel
in
chicago.
i
was
then
the
deputy
director
of
federal
defenders
project.
i
am
now
director
of
the
federal
defenders,
san
diego
and
this
court
was
kind
enough
to
allow
me
continue
to
any
point.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
j.
cleary
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
response
to
one
of
the
questions
earlier
put
the
requirement,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court,
in
1896
code
section
1357
(a)
(1).
it
deals
with
the
right
of
an
immigration
officer
to
interrogate
any
person,
any
alien,
or
any
person
believed
to
be
an
alien
concerning
his
citizenship.
there
is
not
the
next
step
to
the
next
as
said,
because
there
is
another
statute
requiring
this
individual
to
carry
his
alien
registration
with
the
card
that
he
might
been
produce
the
card.
there
are
three
separate
statutory
sections,
on
the
problems
confronting
the
defendant
in
this
case
which
of
course,
he
felt,
was
not
need
to
be
raised,
it
is
possibly
to
discriminatory
inherent
defect
within
the
statute
which
means
to
say
that
anyone
could
be
inquired
or
interrogated
in
this
fashion.
in
this
case,
the
defendant
contends
that
the
interrogation
conducted
in
this
case,
under
these
circumstances
call
for
the
application
of
fifth
amendment.
he
would
even
contend
that
it
is
even
stronger
than
miranda
because
of
the
circumstances
involved
in
the
nature
of
the
interrogation.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
government's
exhibit
one,
for
identification
was
hos
forged
card.
i
think
they
used
a
social
security
card,
i
am
not
sure.
they
also
introduced
a
statement
of
mrs.
diana
barbette
garcia,
concerning
her
statement
requesting
another
card
because
she
lost
the
card
in
a
court,
we
have
asserted
that
this
is
taken
(inaudible)
in
the
violation
of
his
confrontation,
introduced
the
statements
of
another
person.
those
two
items
were
an
essence
to
(inaudible)
mr.
john
j.
cleary
several;
first
the
actual
knowledgeable
possession
and
that
was
manifested
by,
show
me
proof
of
citizenship
or
upon
the
second
interrogation,
produce
your
card.
it
was
no
longer
a
proof
was
the
term
he
asked
the
first
time,
second
time,
produce
your
card.
so
by
producing
a
card
he
would
then
portray
a
verbal
act
that
he
had
knowledgeable
possession
of
that
card.
one
of
the
elements
of
the
offense
is
his
knowledgeable
possession.
two;
the
card
itself,
in
the
result
the
actual
production
of
the
card,
turning
over
the
card
was
introduced
in
evidence
against,
those
were
the
items
that
incriminated.
in
other
words,
there
was
a
combination
of
both
a
physical
and
a
verbal
act.
there
was
also
a
statement
on
this
man
that
he
was
and
acknowledged
the
card
and
there
was
one
confession
i
was
able
to
knock
out
on
the
ground
that
volunteer
mr.
mcmeller
(ph)
rule
and
the
district
court
did
grant
that,
but
they
let
in
another
one,
an
earlier
statement
to
the
authority.
at
this
time
was
neither
the
court,
i
would
like
to
ask
permission
to
be
able
to
cite
two
additional
authorities
concerning
my
case.
the
first
one
deals
with,
a
court
of
military
appeals
and
that
is,
u.s.
versus
nowling,
9
united
states
court
of
military
appeals,
100,
1958,
and
the
other
court
case
i
would
like
to
cite
and
that
is
on
the
issues
one
and
two
dealing
with
fifth
amendment
and
the
production
of
the
card,
an
item,
4
(c),
requirement
of
defense
counsel
be
allowed
to
interview
witnesses
before
they
are
deported
as
affective
assistance
to
counsel,
i
would
cite
to
the
court
an
--
it
was
not
in
the
f
2nd
reporter
yet,
u.s.
versus
linda
rodriguez,
ninth
circuit,
number
71,
1238,
dated,
13,
july
1971.
the
--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
u.s.
versus
nowling
and
--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
9
u.s.c.m.a.
100.
that
case
dealt
with
almost
head
on
with
this
type
of
situation
that
we
have
here
in
the
sense
that
and
the
courts
below,
the
lower
court
certainly
not
binding
on
this
court,
it
was
where
an
air
force
policeman
thought
that
an
airman
did
not
have
a
proper
pass,
a
required
document
possibly
by
the
military
service.
he
went
up
and
he
--
thinking
that
he
might
possibly
not
have
an
appropriate
pass,
he
said,
produce
your
pass.
the
man
produced
the
pass
and
the
court
held
that
this
was
in
violation
of
article
31
of
uniform
code
of
military
justice
which
is
the
precursor
through
the
miranda
position
on
the
warning
it
must
given
to
servicemen.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
well,
that
is
a
question
that
i
would
not
be
able
to
really
respond
to
your
honor.
the
question
of
the
interrogation
in
this
case,
one
has
to
take
a
look
at
the
total
circumstances.
this
was
task
force
group
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service.
this
is
a
sweep
type
of
a
procedure
whereby
they
apprehend
certain
aliens.
it
is
brought
out
in
the
transcript
that
they
knew
of
people
that
they
had
planned
to
apprehend.
they
apprehended
them
and
then
extended
to
them
the
courtesy
of
securing
their
own
their
clothes.
in
this
case,
there
was
an
entry
made
into
the
apartment
the
first
time.
that
time
the
authority
of
the
officer
was
present
and
it
was,
demanded
up
to
defendant
and
say,
produce
proof
of
your
citizenship.
he
complied,
a
certain
production
was
made
at
that
time.
thereafter
they
left.
when
they
left
they
arrested
another
one
on
the
street,
another
alien
as
they
determined
because
this
man
now
had
a
forged
card.
the
other
had
none.
with
this
knowledge
the
agents
most
candidly
stated
for
the
record
that
i
now
thought
that
the
other
man
when
he
entered
the
apartment
had
a
forged
card.
he
had
that
knowledge.
he
then,
going
back
into
the
apartment,
entered
the
apartment
again
for
the
alleged
purpose
of
securing
clothes
of
their
prisoner.
but
it
is
our
contention
of
course,
and
it
is
stated
in
the
brief
that
this
one
is
beyond
the
legitimate
ambit
of
their
entry
into
the
apartment
and
then
interrogated
this
defendant
with
the
express
design
of
producing
that
which
would
incriminate.
the
court
of
appeals
felt
that
this
was
the
equivalent
of
making
a
man
produce
varied
evidence
of
his
guilt
which
in
fact
was
not
clearly
demonstrated
in
this
case.
these
are
the
circumstances
that
was
trigger,
if
at
all,
the
application
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
required
records
document
as
really
initiated
and
formulated
in
shapiro
deals
with
the
quite
different
situation.
in
that
case,
there
was
business
record.
in
this
case
we
have
a
personal
card
belonging
to
the
individual.
the
shapiro
case
was
further
refined
in
the
language
of
justice
harlan
in
marchetti
and
he
sets
out
certain
requirements.
the
third
one
is
the
key
requirement
and
that
is
the
requirements
dealing
with
the
albertson
rule
and
that
is
to
say,
when
it
focuses
in
on
certain
suspect
class.
our
contention
is
not
even
a
class,
it
is
an
individual,
one
defendant
and
when
that
class
cannot
be
penalized,
and
here
the
penalty
is
most
obvious.
in
miranda,
the
man
only
gave
a
statement
of
complicity.
in
miranda
he
did
give
evidence
of
his
guilt
or
his
statement
leading
to
evidence.
in
this
case
it
was
the
whole
act
was
the
admission
of
guilt.
if
there
is
some
relationship
in
the
intensity
that
would
require
for
the
interplay
of
the
fifth
amendment
especially
when
here
the
status
of
the
agent
is
greatly
enhanced.
for
example,
if
they
were
suspecting
of
him
some
ordinary
criminal
offense,
he
could
not
so
interrogate
him.
with
this
case
they
cannot
ask
if
he
has
the
the
citizenship.
they
can
ask
anyone
and
it
is
a
more
a
possibly
a
danger
when
you
have
a
man
who
is
from
a
foreign
land,
does
not
speak
our
language,
would
not
necessarily
be
in
the
likeness
to
our
laws
or
as
to
his
right
to
resist
if
at
all.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
your
honor,
you
are
touching
upon
a
matter
that
was
just
briefly
hit
upon
on
the
record
and
since
i
served
as
defense
counsel
at
trial,
i
have
done
my
utmost
to
secure
a
deportation
order
for
the
defendant
and
in
the
nature
of
plea
bargaining
had
foreclosed
the
charge
with
the
court
in
presence
of
the
us
attorney
and
almost
literally
begged
for
a
misdemeanor
violation
under
8
u.s.c.
1325.
the
immigration
was
adamant.
their
general
contention
was
yet
fooled
in
ifs
and
as
agent
on
the
first
time,
by
the
first
go
around
and
hence
they
would
import
what
i
felt
was
draconian
penalty.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
he
was
arrested
for
a
forged
card.
however
--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
yes,
it
appears
in
the
characterization
of
judge
lynch,
where
judge
lynch
said
at
the
time
you
arrested
him,
you
did
have
him
for
the
forged
card,
was
the
violation
of
title
xviii
and
their
contention
was,
the
immigration
contention
was,
well,
we
had
him
for
that,
but
really
we
do
not
have
to
do
anything
with
the
minor
rule
5
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
because
we
have
him
administratively
and
we
do
not
need
to
bring
him
before
a
magistrate.
judge
lynch
discounted
that
and
said
no,
when
you
have
him
for
a
federal
crime
you
must
comply
the
rule
5
and
bring
him
before
a
magistrate.
he
was
not
brought
before
a
magistrate
but
was
held
a
month
until
counsel
was
appointed
and
one
of
the
arguments
we
have
laid
before
in
the
trial
court
and
court
of
appeals
and
again
before
this
court,
is
the
delay
in
the
appointment
of
counsel.
the
nature
of
the
interrogation
here
was
unique.
it
was
in
the
man’s
home.
the
status
of
the
investigator
has
been
clearly
demonstrated
by
the
counsel
for
the
--
solicitor
general
has
indicated
that
they
stated
their
purpose
while
they
were
in
there.
they
readily
had
apprehended
two
of
his
roommates
and
it
demonstrated
their
power
to
seize
and
apprehend
persons.
the
critical
point
that
we
try
to
raise
is
that
trying
to
understand
what
the
fifth
amendment
was
trying
to
do
and
that
is
the
spirit.
here,
we
have
light
years
of
different
between
an
alien
from
a
different
country,
on
foreign
soil,
unfamiliar
with
the
laws,
unfamiliar
with
the
language
dealing
with
the
federal
investigator’s
experience
bi-lingual,
knowledgeable
on
his
own
home
ground.
there
was
no
place
that
was
safe
from
this
immigration
examination
or
question.
and
somewhere
along
the
line,
the
fifth
amendment
protects
this
type
of
conduct.
we
contend
that
the
circumstances
here
are
far
more
coercive
and
far
more
detrimental
than
those
existing
in
miranda.
if
anything,
we
would
try
to
draw
upon
the
analogy
in
orozco
versus
texas
indicates
that
the
fifth
amendment
should
be
applied
not
in
terms
of
a
geographical
study
but
in
terms
of
a
right
or
privacy
of
the
individual.
if
there
is
some
zone
or
right
of
the
individual
to
be
protected
and
that
right
to
be
protected
against
self
incrimination
should
not
depend
upon
whether
he
is
in
a
jail
house
or
in
his
flat.
but
a
fortiori
that
being
in
his
own
flat,
he
was
entitled
to
some
deference
by
the
immigration
agents.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
no
sir.
that
--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
the
purpose
of
the
card,
your
honor
is
that,
it
is
a
form
of
identification
in
several
respects.
it
can
--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
i
would
have
to
say
that
it
is
for
a
mutual
benefit
that
of
the
government
and
that
of
the
individual.
for
example,
if
the
man
was
an
alien,
and
asked
to
produce
some
evidence,
they
only
show
may
be
a
passport
or
birth
certificate,
that
is
not
legitimate
authority
to
have
it
here
in
the
united
state
lawfully.
so
hence,
he
would
have
to
maybe
check
with
the
ins
or
something
like
this.
the
card
would
give
him
that
advantage.
the
benefit
of
the
government
of
course
is
to
regulate
the
aliens
which
was
the
very
basis
of
the
act
when
it
was
passed,
i
believe
in
1941.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
primary
purpose
is
to
really
identify
and
provide
a
means
of
authority.
the
contention
of
the
defendant
would
be
that
congress
have
to
fulcrum
on
his
head
and
the
question
is
the
card
is
there,
that
congress
felt
that
it
was
appropriate
for
them
to
produce
the
card
and
i
think
it
should
have
made
a
legislation
to
that
effect.
there
is
no
such
legislation.
in
fact
in
the
same
way
that
the
man
could
have
produced
other
evidence,
i
am
sure
that
would
have
been
satisfactory,
but
this
is
a
convenient
form
to
show
a
person’s
legitimate
data.
i
think
the
point
made
by
justice
douglas
and
that
is
considered
by
the
defendant
such
is
upon
the
matters
that
when
the
inquiry
went
into
the
second
time
what
it
was
dealing
with
was
a
legitimate
alien
registration
receipt
card.
it
was
dealing
with
a
piece
of,
for
lack
for
a
better
term,
contraband
or
evidence
that
would
be
able
to
prove
guilt.
at
that
time,
this
assignment
was
required
to
produce
that
evidence.
and
it
was
no
longer
using
which
we
go
along
with
and
we
did
argue
with
the
court
of
appeals,
now
we
assert
in
this
court
that
the
government
could
not
make
general
interrogation.
sullivan
versus
the
united
states
attacked
the
right
to
make
general
neutral
inquiry.
i
think
it
is
totally
permissible,
and
i
think
that
is
wholly
within
--
inconsistent
with
the
fifth
amendment
but
to
focus
in
on
this
type
of
defendant,
i
think
it
transcends
that
and
the
government
should
not
be
able
to
do
as
a
bootstrap,
statutory
right
to
make
interrogations
in
justifying
the
constitution.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
your
honor,
that
i
cannot
--
that
argument
was
not
reached
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
contention
was
duel.
we
had
made
the
contention
that
interrogation
had
gone
beyond
the
legitimate
scope
of
the
entry,
that
is
one
of
the
additional
argument
in
support
of
our
position
and
my
contention
is
that
the
basic
inquiry,
even
conducted
out
in
the
street,
given
these
circumstances,
the
agent
walking
up,
thinking
that
the
man
has
a
forged
card
and
then
he
asked
him
to
produce
it
under
the
semblance
of
his
authority,
i
still
feel
would
violate
the
fifth
amendment.
however,
it
is
our
contention
that
this
circumstance
is
greatly
aggravated
by
the
fact
that
it
took
place
within
the
man’s
own
apartment.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
that
most
difficult
situation
be
--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
the
--
i
think
one
has
to
look
at
the
nature
of
the
intrusion
if
--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
the
intrusion
is
into
his
apartment
concerning
the
way
he
gave
--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
one
would
--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
the
--
no
matter
how
one
might
try
characterize
a,
so
to
speak
little
chat
with
the
immigration
officer,
i
would
dare
say
that
it
would
be
somewhat
coercive,
the
only
case
i
can
think
of
is
california
supreme
court
decision,
where
a
woman
was
asked
to
come
down
and
speak
to
a
friendly
da
about
the
case
and
the
court
held
that
that
was
coercive.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
well,
your
honor
i
would
dare
say
that
my
experience
of
the
immigration,
i
find
them
to
be
more
of
the
most
fiercest
and
enthusiastic
enforcement
of
the
law
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
j.
cleary
your
honor,
i
would
have
to
say
yes
in
the
absence
of
a
statute
that
requires
compulsory
production.
i
think
the
answer
lies
here
very
simply
that
the
agents
thought
that
they
had
probable
cause
that
he
had
a
bad
card,
they
could
have
seized
him
having
probable
cause
for
a
valid
arrest
and
then
taken
the
card
from
him
and
then
they
would
have
had
him.
on
the
other
ground,
even
in
the
office
i
feel
that
absent
a
statute
or
absent
some
regulatory
scheme
to
require
a
production
that
the
fifth
amendment
would
protect
him
from
the
situation.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
no,
your
honor.
the
man
with
the
legitimate
card
has
the
same
exact
right
because
there
is
no
statute.
however,
if
he
was
interrogated,
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
as
a
matter
of
convenience,
he
might
wish
to
show
the
card
and
thereby
end
the
interrogation
as
authorized
under
the
statute.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
well,
that
is
something
that
we
do
not
know,
but
that
in
some
circumstances,
if
it
was
a
voluntary
situation,
if
it
was
one
where
a
man
could
be
shown
that
he
had,
so
to
speak,
knowingly
and
understandingly
try
to
perpetrate
some
type
of
fraud
on
the
government
agent
then
i
think
we
might
run
into
some
probable
waiver
of
fifth
amendment.
no
such
evidence
is
present
in
this
record.
all
we
have
is
a
demand
of
the
agent
and
a
demand
for
the
card.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
the
purpose
of
the
card
is
to
identify
those
in
the
united
states
who
are
aliens,
lawfully
admitted
as
immigrants,
that
is
to
say
on
a
more
public
relations
(voice
overlap).
mr.
john
j.
cleary
the
reasons
where
it
got
far
--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
there
is
also
other
reasons.
i
would
have
to
say
that
there
are
cases
where
a
man
might
not
even
have
an
alien
registration
receipt
card,
but
might
have
some
lawful
status
within
the
united
states.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
in
that
respect
(voice
overlap).
mr.
john
j.
cleary
well,
i
think
it
is
also
for
the
government’s
benefit.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
he
does
have
to
show
it
unless
he
wants
to.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
the
required
record,
yes,
that
there
will
no
fifth
amendment
claim.
i
believe
justice
frankfurter
covered
the
point
far
more
adequately
than
i
thought
in
his
dissenting
opinion
and
also
one
comment
thereby
another
one
of
the
dissenting
judge,
i
think
it
was
in
wilson,
which
i
cited
in
my
brief
which
pointed
out
that,
i
think
it
was
--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
no
sir.
i
am
just
saying
that
there
was
a
concurring
or
dissenting
opinion
in
shapiro
where
the
judge
said
that
this
case
now
applies
to
business
records.
however,
it
can
be
put
to
its
extreme
in
our
experience
that
given
the
type
of
opportunities
on
statutes.
it
can
be
pushed
to
its
limits.
what
i
am
saying
in
this
case
is
it
has
been
pushed
to
the
limit
that
it
is
far
beyond
the
business
record
designed
to
be
ensure
--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
well,
i
would
take
yes,
definitely,
that
difference,
i
think
i
have
made
a
statement
earlier
that
this
is
not
the
regular
inquiry
for
a
card.
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
contraband
item
in
that
--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
what
is
that
--?
mr.
john
j.
cleary
that
is
right.
again
the
logical
extreme.
if
i
could
comment
briefly
on
the
contentions
we
made
concerning
an
equal
important
point,
but
a
jurisdictional
point,
touched
upon
by
justice
stewart
and
that
is
the
application
of
18
u.s.c.
1546
to
an
alien’s
registration
receipt
card.
the
card
here
serves
as
some
type
of
entry
document,
but
the
document
is
a
re-entry
document.
on
the
card
there
was
a
back
portion
where
aliens
living
the
country
and
re-enter
with
the
alien
registration
receipt
card.
the
contention
made
here
is
that
the
statute
does
not
cover
this
particular
card.
the
first
one
is
that
entry
is
distinguishable
from
re-entry
and
to
the
court
we
cite
the
precedent
of
this
court
in
(inaudible)
case
as
interpreted
by
the
mcfarland,
a
second
circuit’s
opinion.
second
point
that
we
make
is
the
regulatory
characterization
of
the
card
by
the
immigration
authority.
there
was
a
two
categorization,
registration
card
and
evidence
of
registration.
this
card
is
secured
within
30
days
after
entry
into
the
united
states,
not
at
entry.
that
is
our
contention
that
the
ambit
and
scope
of
1546
was
directed
at
those
who
would
put
forward
some
type
of
legal
documentation
to
indicate
lawful
status
in
the
united
states.
that
is
to
say,
false
birth
certificates
or
other
items
to
give
him
the
aura
of
legitimacy
within
the
united
states
that
this
was
not
the
intent
of
congress.
further
it
can
be
easily
reviewed
by
taking
a
look
at
the
regulatory
scheme,
as
justice
marshall
first
defined
it
early
and
that
is
that
there
is
a
scheme
of
removal
of
those
unlawfully
in
the
united
states
who
misconstrue
the,
so
to
speak,
poem
on
the
statute
of
liberty,
who
look
for
a
better
land
as
in
this
case,
this
defendant.
and
that
at
first
is
a
voluntary
return,
no
deportation
necessary,
a
person
can
be
returned
with
government
funds
or
without
government
funds
to
mexico.
two,
deportation,
three,
unlawful
entry
under
8
u.s.c.
1325,
first
offense,
$500.00,
six
months,
second
offense,
two
years,
$1,000.00,
next
step
will
be
9
1326.
the
person
who
has
been
deported

returns,
two
years,
$2,000.00.
then
moving
on,
to
the
more
serious
ones,
1546
and
we
have
the
five
years
and
then
1306
(c)
and
that
is
the
one
who
counterfeits
the
alien
registration
receipt
card.
the
further
point
is
that
within
the
statute
we
have
a
patent
in
consideration
and
that
is
that
in
the
second
paragraph
of
1546,
there
are
set
forth
a
statute
to
deal
with
the
counterfeiting
of
documents
required,
for
instance,
in
1306
of
title
viii
(d),
there
is
also
a
like
provision
dealing
with
counterfeiting
but
this
time
specifically
dealing
with
alien
registration
receipt
card.
this
counterfeiting
provision
does
not
meet
our
situation
where
we
have
only
possession,
but
it
is
submitted
by
the
defendant
that
if
a
specific
statute
deals
with
alien
registration
receipt
card
as
others
in
the
document
required
for
entry
and
that
both
of
this
statutes
were
enacted
as
part
of
the
same
package
legislation,
immigration
nationality
act,
therefore,
given
affect
for
both
statutory
sections
there
is
an
inconsistency.
applying
the
principle
of
legacy
,
i
think
the
only
answer
is
that
that
this
type
of
violation
and
it
is
treated
that
way
in
most
ordinary
cases
even
aggravated
cases
is
no
more
than
a
misdemeanor
under
8
u.s.c.
1325.
the
other
arguments
contended
by
respondent
in
this
case
dealt
with
the
cert
and
that
was
the
aggravating
statute
upon
the
entry
into
the
premise
under
the
excerpts
of
the
united
states,
the
fourth
amendment
protection
is
not
complete.
and
that
here,
there
can
be
no
showing
that
the
defendant
who
consented
to
this
type
of
interrogation
even
though
the
agent
might
have
the
right
to
conduct
that
interrogation
on
the
street
or
at
their
office,
their
going
into
his
own
home,
there
is
no
showing
of
that.
they
gained
access
by
the
use
of
the
other
of
his
other
prisoners
to
pick
your
clothing
that
did
not
give
him,
the
agent
the
right
to
conduct
this
type
of
criminal
inquiry.
the
hearsay
rule
was
a
statement
of
ms.
diana
varga.
we
do
not
take,
so
to
speak,
opposition
to
the
public
record
exception
which
the
solicitor
general
wishes
to
contend.
we
contend
that
if
the
statement
by
the
selective
service
file
or
other
public
documents
made
by
the
public
official,
they
can
come
in
as
a
traditional
exception
for
the
hearsay
rule.
however,
what
we
do
take
exception
with
is,
when
there
is
a
statement
of
a
witness
which
is
made
and
then
becomes
a
part
of
the
file
and
then
the
file
is
introduced,
not
much
the
whole
file,
but
that
statement
is
introduced
and
there
is
no
showing
of
unavailability
of
the
witness,
we
contend
that
that
denies
the
right
of
confrontation.
further,
the
question
of
defense
counsel,
we
were
--
i
was
appointed
in
this
case,
i
think
approximately
four
days
after
the
two
witnesses,
the
last
as
to
which
has
been
deported
back
to
mexico
beyond
the
reach
of
any
type
of
subpoena.
in
my
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment,
i
alleged
this
prejudicial
delay
because
here
counsel
was
unable
to
effectively
prepare
this
case
by
interrogating
two
key
witnesses
who
would
have
very
definite
information
as
to
the
circumstances
surrounding
their
consent
to
the
ins
agents
to
enter
the
apartment.
the
government
cite,
u.s.
versus
coleman
in
the
reply
brief
which
i
reviewed
on
the
tuesday,
but
in
reading
that
case,
one
can
see
that
it
is
totally
distinguishable
because
counsel
in
that
case
was
appointed
or
re-countered
his
appearance
in
august,
the
man
was
not
deported
until
the
following
january.
in
this
case,
my
appointment
followed
the
deportation.
two,
in
the
coleman
case
their
was
no
showing
that
the
prosecution
was
aware
of
the
transportation.
here,
the
prosecutor
was
present
in
court
when
the
court
ordered
remanded
linda
mendez
for
the
ins
for
deportation.
but
i
say
that
in
this
case,
it
was
prejudicial,
it
was
not
speculative
because
it
deals
as
one
of
the
essential
issues
here
in
a
sense.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
your
honor,
i
served
as
a
member
of
the
federal
defendant
panel
in
chicago.
i
was
then
the
deputy
director
of
federal
defenders
project.
i
am
now
director
of
the
federal
defenders,
san
diego
and
this
court
was
kind
enough
to
allow
me
continue
to
any
point.
