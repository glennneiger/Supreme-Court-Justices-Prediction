mr.

i
tell
you
what
confuses
me
is
your
position
today
i
suppose
may
be
(inaudible)
particularly
in
your
brief.
i
am
reading
from
page
5
of
your
brief,
“it
is
rather
a
public
document
like
a
driver’s
license

you
said
that,

well,
i
know

i
understand
your

then
that
obviates
the

miranda
was

your

justice
william
j.
brennan,

i
think
mr.
reynolds,
i
gather,
you
said
the
first
time
he
tried
to
require
recognition
as
something
which
by
law
one
is
required
to
maintain,

is
there
also
an

of
that
doctrine,
in

to
maintaining

you
must
also
produce
it
upon
the

agent?
justice
william

and
must
also
produce
it
or
has
a

to
produce
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
thought
that
you
have
taken
the
position
anyway,
are
you
not,
that
because
it
was
forged,
it
cannot
fall
within
the
required
record
statute?
