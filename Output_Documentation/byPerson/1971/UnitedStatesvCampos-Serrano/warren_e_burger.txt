the
arguments
next
in
number
46,
united
states
against
campos-serrano.
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
perhaps,
we
are
happy
to
grant
your
motion
and
we
will
be
happy
to
welcome
mr.
reynolds
on
a
more
prominent
basis.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
you
know,
how
long
would
it
take
as
a
practical
matter
to
execute
that,
carry
out
that
exercise?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
the
agent
would
draw
some
inferences
but
might
be
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
subject?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
is
not
this
alien
in
the
same
position
that
i
am,
if
an
immigration
our
officer
that
comes
to
me
and
says
let
me
see
your
alien
card
and
i
say,
“i
have
no
alien
card
and
i
am
not
an
alien
and
if
i
did
have
one,
i
would
not
show
it
to
you.”
he
does
not
know
that
if
the
man
is
an
alien
by
looking
at
him,
does
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
a
request
for
an
alien
card
is
not
something
which
officers
has
throw
around
(inaudible)
i
would
assume?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
that
a
man
has
asked
for
his
card
asked
to
exhibit
it,
whether
in
his
home
or
on
the
street,
he
might
much
rather
prefer
to
do
that
than
being
directly
to
report
to
the
immigration
office
on
the
following
day
at
10
o’clock
in
the
morning.
that
is
a
greater
inconvenience
to
himself.
is
that
not
a
reasonable
assumption?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
if
he
did
not,
if
he
refused
to
exhibit
the
card
would
that
be
the
start
of
the
remedy
that
the
immigration
officer
would
pursue,
is
that
one
of
the
alternatives?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
not
a
fairly
common
thing
for
the
holders
of
these
cards
to
be
requested
by
writing
or
otherwise
to
report
to
the
immigration
office
without
knowing
at
the
time
what
they
are
reporting
for?
i
thought
that
was
a
matter
of
common
knowledge.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
everything
that
is
“required,”
the
only
thing
that
required
is
to
produce
of
his
own
desire
to
pass
it
off
as
a
valid
doctrine,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
reynolds.
mr.
cleary.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
the
decisions
of
that
court
reviewable
anywhere?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
carries
a
right
of
privacy
so
far
as
(inaudible)
to
the
same
constitution
or
require
an
alien,
carry
an
alien
card?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
card
then
if
no
one
can
look
at
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
for
his
benefit?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
their
primary
purpose?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
very
--
suppose
instead
of
in
his
own
apartment,
he
was
questioned
for
exhibiting
his
the
second
time
and
saying,
well,
the
agent
had
said,
can
you
produce
your
card
to
the
immigration
office
tomorrow
morning
at
10
o’clock,
here
is
the
address,
here
is
my
card.
so
at
10
o’clock
the
following
morning
this
gentleman
came
in
and
the
first
request
was
do
you
have
your
card
with
you?
yes.
can
we
see
it?
then
all
the
events
transpired
as
it
has
here,
what
would
you
say
about
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
he
is
in
a
much
more,
he
is
on
a
custodial
atmosphere
as
compared
to
being
in
his
hometown,
at
home,
and
try
to
(inaudible).
chief

warren
e.
burger
intrusion,
which
is
the
intrusion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
(voice
overlap)
no,
it
was
downtown
in
the
immigration
office?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
asking
for
a
routine
check
on
his
card?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
but
the
da
is
apparently
a
prosecutor,
the
immigration
officer,
what
is
the
category,
they
are
required
to
report
there
from
time
to
time,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
testimony
on
that
is
not
relevant
mr.
cleary.
what
about
this
gentleman
in
the
immigration
office
routinely
exhibiting
his
card.
do
you
think
that
is
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
very
--
has
been
moved
in
the
interim,
mr.
cleary
as
you
have,
(inaudible)
you
were
appointed
by
the
court.
you
came
here
at
our

and
we
