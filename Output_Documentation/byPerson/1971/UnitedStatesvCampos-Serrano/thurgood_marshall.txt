justice
thurgood
marshall
he
had
found
in
that
he
did
not
have
the
card
and
admitted
that
he
was
illegally
there,
would
the
government
had
done
anything
other
than
deport
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
they
have
done
anything
else
as
a
matter
of
quality,
what
is
the
policy?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
did
not
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
they
have
authority
to
arrest?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
they
arrested
the
other
man
who
did
not
have
a
card
(voice
overlap)
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
he
could
arrest
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
my
last
question
on
that
point
is,
does
this
man,
whatever
his
name
is
serrano,
did
he
know
that
the
agents
could
arrest
him.
one
did
he
know
he
did
not
have
to
show
the
card?
perhaps
he
said
there
was
indeed
there
was
nobody.
the
man
just
gotten
in
and
said
i
got
ortiz,
i
just
arrested
ortiz,
i
am
going
to
take
him
away.
now,
let
me
see
your
card.
do
not
you
think
that
that
man
assumed
that
he
had
a
probable
arrest
or
assumed
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
that
he
was
under
his
duty
to
show
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
reynolds.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
reynolds,
my
problem
is
that
assuming
that
you
did
not
have
any
miranda
problem,
if
i
can
go
and
ask
the
man,
are
you
an
alien
or
not,
solely
because
of
the
statute
which
puts
--
which
gives
the
agent
the
right
over
alien,
right?
if
you
are
still
in
that,
does
it
automatically
follow
that
the
same
alien
and
the
same
officer,
is
in
the
identical
position
of
no
miranda
ruling
when
the
purpose
is
to
find
evidence
to
convict
of
a
crime.
again,
i
come
back
to
the
difference
between
deportation
and
criminal
conviction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
it
not
--
is
not
an
alien
always
in
the
custody
of
a
immigration
officer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
can
he
stop
him
at
any
time
and
ask
him
anything
he
wants
to
ask
him
under
any
circumstances?
justice
thurgood
marshall
alright,
that
is
close
to
custody.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice
overlap)
he
leave
home,
like
people
sometimes
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said
(inaudible),
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
why
do
you
have
to
recommend
a
deal
before
you
deport
him,
you
are
going
to
deport
him
when
he
gets
done
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
they
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
would
you
not
assume
so?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
shows
what
he
was
arrested
for?
was
he
arrested
for
illegal
entry
or
arrested
by
having
a
forged
card?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice
overlap)
when
he
was
arrested?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
that
appear
in
the
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
your
real
argument
is
that
anybody
with
a
forged
one
has
protection
that
a
guy
with
a
legitimate
one
does
not
have,
is
that
not
your
argument?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
he
had
a
forgery
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
card?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
the
reason
to
identify
this
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
if
they
are
not
legal
aliens,
resident
aliens,
they
are
illegal
aliens,
is
that
not
the
reason?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
not
the
real
reason
to
be
sure
that
he
can
at
all
raise
and
establish
the
fact
that
he
is
a
legitimate
alien?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
creates
benefit,
is
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
is
his
benefit
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
--
witness
says
okay,
so
when
he
shows
the
forged
one
when
the
guys
left?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
was
his
benefit
and
he
does
not
have
to
show
it
unless
he
wants
to?
justice
thurgood

he
had
found
in
that
he
did
