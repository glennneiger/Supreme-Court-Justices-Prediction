mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
to
review
the
decision
of
that
court,
reversing
a
judgment
of
conviction
of
the
district
court.
it
presents
important
questions
relating
to
the
manner
in
which
immigration
investigators
can
without
infringing
on
the
individual
right
against
self-incrimination
under
the
fifth
amendment,
carry
out
their
statutory
of
responsibility
to
determine
whether
aliens
or
persons
believed
to
be
aliens
are
lawfully
in
the
united
states.
the
facts
were
essentially
these.
on
the
morning
of
november
19,
1968,
approximately
eight
agents
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
conducted
an
investigation
of
employees
as
a
rule
on
manufacturing
company
in
chicago,
illinois
where
it
was
expected
that
aliens
unlawfully
in
the
united
states
were
working.
some
15
or
16
aliens
were
arrested
for
being
in
the
country
in
violation
of
the
immigration
law,
including
juan
miguel
rico.
all
were
place
in
agent’s
automobile
and
as
is
customary
practice,
they
were
driven
to
their
respective
residences
to
gather
their
personal
belongings.
upon
arriving
at
rico’s
residence
at
approximately
8:45
am,
rico
and
two
ins
investigators,
jacobs
and
beryl,
went
to
the
door
of
his
apartment.
rico
knocked
and
respondent
opened
the
door
and
admitted
the
three
men.
the
agents
identified
themselves
and
explained
to
respondent
in
spanish
that
rico
had
been
arrested
and
that
they
were
there
to
collect
his
personal
belongings.
no
search
was
made
of
the
premises.
agent
beryl
accompanied
rico
into
his
room,
agent
jacobs
remained
in
the
living
room
with
the
respondent.
jacob
who
is
an
ins
investigator
is
authorized
by
statute
to
interrogate
without
warrant,
any
alien
or
person
believed
to
be
an
alien
as
to
his
right
to
be
or
remain
in
the
united
states.
he
inquired
in
spanish
as
to
respondent's
citizenship.
respondent
replied
that
he
was
mexican
and
when
asked
about
his
alien
status,
he
stated
that
he
was
a
resident
alien.
jacobs
then
asked
for
proof
and
respondent
produced
his
alien
registration
receipt
card
which
is
the
identification
card
that
is
issued
by
the
immigration
service
to
all
the
aliens
who
have
been
locally
admitted
into
the
country
in
a
permanent
resident
status.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
the
green
card,
your
honor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
at
all
times,
yes
your
honor
by
the
statute.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
the
statute
does
not
require
that
he
display
it.
the
statute
requires
that
he
retain
it
in
his
possession
at
all
times
and
the
statute
does
permit
interrogation
of
the
alien
to
satisfy
the
investigators.
it
authorizes
under
request
and
to
display
but
the
statute
did
not
require
that
he
display
that
as
a
batch.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
on
his
person,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
exactly,
it
is
like
the
draft
card.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
he
could
proved
his
status
in
another
way,
although
not
in
as
direct
way
for
hatch.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
he
has
the
--
he
has
--
he
is
required
by
law
to
register
at
the
time
that
he
had
admitted
into
the
country
and
his
status
is
on
the
registration
form,
that
is
information
that
is
in
the
government's
possession
and
he
--
if
he
had
the
passport
for
instance
and
can
show
that
he
is
in
the
country,
has
a
valid
passport
and
give
his
name,
you
can
determined
his
status
from
the
alien
registration
form
which
is
on
file
with
the
government,
but
the
card
is
i
think
the
most
direct
way
to
establish
it.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
would
assume
relatively
short
time.
i
do
not
know
of
great
length
of
time.
i
think
it
could
be
ascertained,
perhaps
if
i
am
an
agent
calling,
making
a
phone
call
i
believe
it
could
be
determined
relatively,
in
relatively
short
period
of
time.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
the
government
could
have
done
something
other
than
deport
him.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
it
is
the
matter
of
policy
that
they
would
have
done
nothing
other
than
the
court.
there
is
a
--
it
is
a
misdemeanor
to
be
in
the
country
illegally
and
there
is
that
possibility,
but
as
a
matter
of
policy,
the
government
would
have
deported
him.
in
fact
that
is
what
the
government
did
with
rico
in
this
case.
they
deported
him.
he
was
in
the
country
unlawfully.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
in
this
case,
this
man
was
indicted,
but
he
was
indicted
for
possession
of
a
false
alien
registration
receipt
form.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
is
correct.
jacobs
inspected
the
alien’s
registration
receipt
card
and
also
he
found
a
social
security
card
which
had
been
produced
on
request
and
he
showed
both
the
cards
to
agent
beryl.
the
lighting
conditions
were
extremely
poor
and
on
this
viewing,
the
agents
found
nothing
in
it.
they
returned
the
documents
to
respondent
and
then
left
the
apartment
with
rico
who
had
by
then
collected
his
personal
effects.
now,
respondent
raises
no
objection
to
this
initial
inquiry
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
it
did
not
violate
respondent's
fifth
amendment
privilege.
this
initial
inquiry
occurred
in
what
the
court
of
appeals
characterized
as
“the
normal
immigration
inquiry
situation
and
that
is
what
permissible,
the
court
concluded,
since
the
card
served
the
non-criminal
purpose
of
an
enabling
the
government
to
be
aware
of
a
number
of
aliens
in
the
country
and
their
status.
when
the
agents
returned
with
rico
to
the
car,
a
third
investigator,
agent
white,
motioned
toward
another
individual
approaching
them
and
suggested
that
he
had
been
acting
--
he
had
acted
suspiciously
on
seeing
the
agent
and
should
be
questioned.
agent
beryl
spoke
to
this
individual,
jose
rodriguez
ortiz
and
inquired
as
to
his
citizenship.
ortiz
produced
an
alien
registration
receipt
card
which
upon
examination
both
beryl
and
white
found
to
be
altered.
ortiz
was
then
placed
under
arrest.
he
was
put
in
jacob’s
car
and
given
miranda
warning
in
spanish
by
jacobs.
he
was
asked
if
he
wanted
to
obtain
any
personal
belongings.
he
stated
that
he
did
and
indicated
that
he
lived
in
the
same
apartment
building
from
which
the
agent
had
just
emerged
with
rico.
agents
white
and
beryl
then
went
with
ortiz.
unexpectedly,
he
led
them
to
the
same
apartment
that
was
occupied
by
rico
and
respondent.
ortiz
opened
the
door
with
a
key
and
as
the
three
agents
--
and
as
the
three
men
entered,
respondent
came
out
of
the
back
room
into
the
living
room.
while
agent
white
accompanied
ortiz
into
his
room
to
collect
his
clothes,
agent
beryl
spoke
with
respondent
in
the
living
room.
he
explained
to
respondent
in
spanish
that
ortiz
was
under
arrest
and
was
being
permitted
to
collect
his
clothes.
then
agent
beryl
thinking
that
if
ortiz’s
card
was
altered,
there
was
a
possibility
that
respondent's
card
too
was
altered
and
recalling
that
its
earlier
inspect
--
earlier
inspection
of
respondent’s
card
had
been
in
the
dimly
living
room.
he
asked
to
see
respondent’s
registration
card,
alien
registration
receipt
card
again.
respondent
gave
him
the
card
and
beryl
examined
it
a
second
time.
the
card
was
shown
to
agent
white
and
both
agents
inspected
it
under
a
flashlight.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
no,
your
honor.
the
agent
could
not
compel
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
the
agent
could
have
appropriately
asked
for
the
card
and
in
this
case,
he
produced
the
card,
but
the
agents
had
no
authority
to
compel
him
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
he
might.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
not
directly.
no,
your
honor.
nothing
could
follow
and
in
these
circumstances
nothing
would
follow.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
i
suppose
could
well
be,
your
honor,
and
might
a
warrant
of
some
further
investigation
on
the
part
of
the
agents
as
to
this
subject,
but
in
terms
of
what
they
could
do
at
that
time,
they
were
in
--
they
had
no
authority
to
do
anything
more.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
no,
your
honor,
they
did
not
have
authority
to
arrest.
now
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
your
honor,
the
agent’s
authority
to
arrest
under
the
statute
arises,
an
immigration,
agent’s
authority,
arises
where
he
has
reason
to
believe
that
the
agent
is
in
the
country
unlawfully
and
that
the
agent
might
try
to
escape
or
flee.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
am
sorry,
the
alien.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
your
honor,
in
these
circumstances,
we
submit
that
there
was,
if
we
are
now
positing
that
the
card
had
not
been
produced,
there
was
not
reason
to
believe
in
these
circumstances
that
respondent
was
in
the
country
unlawfully.
nor
was
there
is
any
reason
to
believe
that
he
would
try
to
escape.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
your
honor
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
as
to
what
respondent
felt
the
record
is
silent
on
that.
i
do
not
think
it
is
unreasonable
to
assume
as
you
suggest
that
he
might
have
thought
that,
but
our
position
is
that
is
not
the
test
in
terms
of
whether
you
need
to
give
miranda
warnings
which
i
believe
is
the
question
you
are
directing
your
remarks
to.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
yes,
your
honor,
i
believe,
that
is
right.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
that
--
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
is
our
position,
your
honor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
believe
that
if
the
document
is
a
public
record,
it
does
not
make
any
difference
whether
miranda
warning,
whether
the
situation
was
custody
or
not
custody.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
because
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
but
your
honor,
if
it
is
a
public
record
then
you
are
not
--
if
it
is
a
required
record,
even
if
in
the
circumstances
here
you
would
say
that
there
was
custody
and
therefore
would
force
him
to
turn
it
over.
you
would
not
be
forcing
him
to
incriminate
himself
under
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
yes.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
yes.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
and
you
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
if
your
question
is
you
have
been
custody
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
it
is
a
--
i
think,
your
honor,
that
if
he
went
ahead
and
answered,
i
do
not
think
he
needs
to
answer
the
second
question.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
think
that
is
a
different
situation
then
if
he
does
show
the
card
and
the
card
is
a
document
which
is
a
required
record
such
as
a
driver’s
license
or
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
that
the
--
i
think
it
is
turns
on
the
state
statue
as
to
whether
or
not
you
have
to
show
him
on
the
request
that
you
have
to
turnover
the
driver’s
license
(voice
overlap)
but
i
think
in
most,
in
most
states
today
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
is
right.
and
if
you
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
actually,
he
would
not
know.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
no,
but
our
point
--
the
proposition
of
mr.
justice
white
is
it
that
the
man
is
in
a
custodial
situation
as
i
understand
here.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
if
the
card
is
a
required
reference
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
then
i
think
it
would
be
admissible
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
yes.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
that
is
correct
as
to
the
question
because
we
are
not
talking,
if
we
had
a
required
reference,
we
are
not
in
a
fifth
amendment
area
that
we
are
in,
in
terms
of
interrogation
that
you
were
positing
when
you
said,
“do
you
ask
the
question?”
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
is
the
--
applied
that
was
the
refusal
(inaudible)
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
it
maybe
requested
legitimately
under
the
law
properly
by
the
lawful
authority,
but
if
there
is
nothing
in
the
law
which
requires
that
he
produced
it,
at
the
time
of
that
request,
but
shapiro,
your
honor
i
believe,
suggested
that
if
you
have
a
record
which
is
required
to
be
kept
and
it
is
a
required
record,
that
then
if
an
officer
asked
for
the
record
that
you
--
the
law
would
assume
that
it
should
be
produced
under
the
required
reference
law.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
and
there
is
an
obligation
in
the
law
to
produce
it?
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
to
the
--
yes,
your
honor,
well,
in
that
respect,
yes.
i
assume
you
were
asking
whether
there
is
an
obligation
on
the
statute
to
produce
it
and
our
position
is
that,
if
they
required
reference
and
it
is
asked,
then
there
is
an
obligation
to
produce
it
without
the
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
answer
to
that
is
that
when
you
were
talking
in
the
miranda
area,
you’re
talking
apparently,
i
think
that
in
this
respect
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
not
in
the
miranda
sense,
your
honor
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
he
may
stop
him
i
believe
at
time
and
interrogate
him
as
to
whether
he
is
lawfully
in
the
united
states.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
that
miranda
defines
custody
as
meaning
focus.
i
think
that
what
miranda
said
quite
explicitly
is
that
focus
in
the
escobedo
sense
under
the
sixth
amendment
question
that
focus
means
custody
that
that
custody
does
not
mean
focus.
now,
our
position
is
that
in
the
first
instance
when
he
first
was
in
the
room
and
asked
the
initial
time,
that
was
not
in
custodial
situation
and
we
submit
that
there
is
nothing
at
the
second
--
on
the
second
occasion,
if
you
look
at
the
surrounding
circumstances
of
the
second
request,
that
would
have
changed
what
was
a
clearly
non-custodial
situation
into
a
custodial
situation.
now,
it
maybe
that
there
was
heighten
suspicion
on
the
part
of
the
agent,
not
probable
cause
--
but
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
the
alien
--
the
alien
was
--
well,
he
was
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
he
was
in
--
in
the
home.
the
agent
went
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
have
to
submit
that
he
would
have
been
--
but
he
was
not
deprived
from
freedom
of
action
in
any
significant
way
which
i
believe
is
a
miranda
test.
the
agent,
after
they
were
given
the
card
went
into
the
kitchen
and
left
the
respondent
alone
in
the
living
room
while
they
examined
the
card.
so
i
think
in
that
respect
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
am
not
saying
that.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
i
believe
that
if
you
have
a
non-custodial
situation
in
the
first
in
the
instance
that
what
the
agent
was
doing
even
though
there
was
heighten
suspicion
in
the
second
which
was,
they
were
making
the
routine
request,
i
mean,
a
routine
interrogation
as
to
whether
this
alien
was
lawfully
in
the
country.
it
was
no
less
no
routine
because
they
might
have
been
a
little
more
suspicious
that
he
had
a
forged
card,
he
was
still
trying
to
determine
whether
this
alien
was
lawfully
in
the
country
and
in
our
view
they
are
very
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
is
the
result
--
the
end
result
i
think.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
that
is
right
but
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
your
honor
that
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
is
a
determination
i
would
not
(voice
overlap).
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
am
not
the
--
but
i
think
that
when
you
are
trying
to
determine
whether
there
was
custody
in
the
miranda
situation
that
is
not
determined
by
what
subsequently
the
decision
might
be
as
to
whether
you
deport
this
alien
or
you
prosecute
a
criminal.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
that
is
a
reasonable
assumption.
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
that
is
a
possibility
whether
or
not
that
was
the
request
for
him
to
report
would
have
to
await
further
investigation
to
determine,
if
there
was
anything
on
file
that
indicated
that
he
had
lawfully
registered
that
those
intervening
circumstances
may
have
occurred,
but
i
think
that
that
might
possibly
be
one
of
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
that
that
does
--
that
that
is
a
practice.
i
would
like
to
say
just
a
word
about
the
--
the
public
of
the
required
record
document.
our
view
is
if
it
is
a
public
record
and
it
is
a
record
that
is
required
by
law
to
be
kept
in
the
possession
of
the
alien
for
very
legitimate
regulatory
purposes
and
in
that
sense
it
is
in
the
most
traditional
sense
within
the
required
records
document.
it
is
a
record
of
public
or
again
it
is
one
that
contains
information
that
is
public
in
nature,
that
is
information,
it
is
already
in
the
possession
of
his
government.
it
had
only
information
as
to
identity,
name,
sex,
date
of
birth,
his
alien
status,
his
registration
number,
his
photograph.
it
is
issued
pursuant
to
or
into
--
the
part
be
maintained
as
into
a
very
legitimate
regulatory
purpose
that
it
controlling
immigration
in
the
united
states.
now,
because
it
is
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
believe
that
the
shapiro
case
indicated
that
where
one
is
required
by
law
to
maintain
a
record
(voice
overlap)
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
he
has
a
duty
to
produce
it.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
believe
that
there
was
a
subpoena.
i
believe
--
i
am
not,
do
not
remember
that
is
on
the
request.
i
believe
it
was
a
subpoena
and
actually
it
was
a
request
for
sales
record
of
a
whole
seller.
the
element
in
shapiro
that
is
not
present
here
is
that
shapiro
was
addressed
to
what
are
essentially
private
records.
and
here
we
ask
what
are
in
a
most
traditional
sense
a
public
record
and
for
that
reason
the
additional
factor
that
was
suggest
in
shapiro
and
appeared
again
in
marchetti
and
grosso
that
is
if
the
record
be
as
a
kind
customarily
checked.
it
is
one
that
in
our
view
has
no
relevance
here,
is
that
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
that
of
course
raises
fourth
amendment
question
that
i
think
that
the
david
case
would
indicate
that
that
was
essentially
the
paper
requirement
that
we
are
talking
about.
whether
or
not
they
could
have
at
that
point
searched
them
or
whether
they
would
have
been
legal
process,
but
that
is
the
type
of
requirement.
davis
indicates
that
in
those
circumstances
where
you
are
dealing
with
a
public
record,
the
police
officer
may
well,
on
the
fourth
amendment
ground
be
able
to
go
a
little
further
than
he
would
normally
be
able
to
go
in
terms
of
obtaining
the
document.
but
i
think
that
is
essentially
probably
to
do
really
are
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
your
honor,
that
i
think
is
what
was
troubling
the
court
of
appeals.
the
required
record
document
turns
on
the
record-keeping
requirement,
possession
of
a
card
and
if
that
card,
under
the
statute
and
that
possession
of
keeping
requirement
is
one
that
is
not
aimed
at
a
highly
selective
group,
inherently
suspected
of
criminal
activity
which
we
maintain
is
the
case
here.
here
you
deal
with
all
aliens.
then
the
fact
that
--
in
this
particular
instance
we
are
dealing
with
a
forged
card,
is
not
enough
to
state
that
this
particular
case
has
the
required
record
document.
you
have
to
look
at
the
scheme,
statutory
scheme
and
see
where
the
scheme,
the
statutory
scheme
is
directed
--
is
at
criminal
activity
alone.
i
believe
that
was
the
threat
to
the
plurality
opinion
in
california
v.
fires
last
term
and
i
think
that
the
scheme
itself
is
important
and
if
in
this
particular
instance
the
respondent
is
maintaining
that
he
alone
because
he
acted
in
an
unlawful
manner,
he
would
have
to
incriminate
himself
by
producing
it.
that
does
not
take
the
doctrine
out
the
required
record.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
believe
that
in
the
document
that
that
is
so,
i
think,
your
honor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
it
was
in
response
to
a
request.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
we
did
deal
with
it
in
some
detail
in
our
reply
brief
that
that
turns,
your
honor
i
believe
on
the
history
of
the
statute,
the
legislative
history
and
the
background
of
this
particular
legislation.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
is
the
only
one
that
i
am
aware
of.
i
do
not
know
if
--
of
any
other
course
as
to
defense.
and
we
for
the
reasons
set
forth
in
the
reply
brief,
we
disagree
with
that
decision.
and
as
to
the
other
issues
that
were
also
raised
initially
in
their
answering
brief,
we
have
dealt
with
them
in
our
reply
brief,
i
was
relying
on
--
thank
you.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
to
review
the
decision
of
that
court,
reversing
a
judgment
of
conviction
of
the
district
court.
it
presents
important
questions
relating
to
the
manner
in
which
immigration
investigators
can
without
infringing
on
the
individual
right
against
self-incrimination
under
the
fifth
amendment,
carry
out
their
statutory
of
responsibility
to
determine
whether
aliens
or
persons
believed
to
be
aliens
are
lawfully
in
the
united
states.
the
facts
were
essentially
these.
on
the
morning
of
november
19,
1968,
approximately
eight
agents
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
conducted
an
investigation
of
employees
as
a
rule
on
manufacturing
company
in
chicago,
illinois
where
it
was
expected
that
aliens
unlawfully
in
the
united
states
were
working.
some
15
or
16
aliens
were
arrested
for
being
in
the
country
in
violation
of
the
immigration
law,
including
juan
miguel
rico.
all
were
place
in
agent’s
automobile
and
as
is
customary
practice,
they
were
driven
to
their
respective
residences
to
gather
their
personal
belongings.
upon
arriving
at
rico’s
residence
at
approximately
8:45
am,
rico
and
two
ins
investigators,
jacobs
and
beryl,
went
to
the
door
of
his
apartment.
rico
knocked
and
respondent
opened
the
door
and
admitted
the
three
men.
the
agents
identified
themselves
and
explained
to
respondent
in
spanish
that
rico
had
been
arrested
and
that
they
were
there
to
collect
his
personal
belongings.
no
search
was
made
of
the
premises.
agent
beryl
accompanied
rico
into
his
room,
agent
jacobs
remained
in
the
living
room
with
the
respondent.
jacob
who
is
an
ins
investigator
is
authorized
by
statute
to
interrogate
without
warrant,
any
alien
or
person
believed
to
be
an
alien
as
to
his
right
to
be
or
remain
in
the
united
states.
he
inquired
in
spanish
as
to
respondent's
citizenship.
respondent
replied
that
he
was
mexican
and
when
asked
about
his
alien
status,
he
stated
that
he
was
a
resident
alien.
jacobs
then
asked
for
proof
and
respondent
produced
his
alien
registration
receipt
card
which
is
the
identification
card
that
is
issued
by
the
immigration
service
to
all
the
aliens
who
have
been
locally
admitted
into
the
country
in
a
permanent
resident
status.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
the
green
card,
your
honor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
at
all
times,
yes
your
honor
by
the
statute.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
the
statute
does
not
require
that
he
display
it.
the
statute
requires
that
he
retain
it
in
his
possession
at
all
times
and
the
statute
does
permit
interrogation
of
the
alien
to
satisfy
the
investigators.
it
authorizes
under
request
and
to
display
but
the
statute
did
not
require
that
he
display
that
as
a
batch.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
on
his
person,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
exactly,
it
is
like
the
draft
card.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
he
could
proved
his
status
in
another
way,
although
not
in
as
direct
way
for
hatch.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
he
has
the
--
he
has
--
he
is
required
by
law
to
register
at
the
time
that
he
had
admitted
into
the
country
and
his
status
is
on
the
registration
form,
that
is
information
that
is
in
the
government's
possession
and
he
--
if
he
had
the
passport
for
instance
and
can
show
that
he
is
in
the
country,
has
a
valid
passport
and
give
his
name,
you
can
determined
his
status
from
the
alien
registration
form
which
is
on
file
with
the
government,
but
the
card
is
i
think
the
most
direct
way
to
establish
it.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
would
assume
relatively
short
time.
i
do
not
know
of
great
length
of
time.
i
think
it
could
be
ascertained,
perhaps
if
i
am
an
agent
calling,
making
a
phone
call
i
believe
it
could
be
determined
relatively,
in
relatively
short
period
of
time.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
the
government
could
have
done
something
other
than
deport
him.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
it
is
the
matter
of
policy
that
they
would
have
done
nothing
other
than
the
court.
there
is
a
--
it
is
a
misdemeanor
to
be
in
the
country
illegally
and
there
is
that
possibility,
but
as
a
matter
of
policy,
the
government
would
have
deported
him.
in
fact
that
is
what
the
government
did
with
rico
in
this
case.
they
deported
him.
he
was
in
the
country
unlawfully.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
in
this
case,
this
man
was
indicted,
but
he
was
indicted
for
possession
of
a
false
alien
registration
receipt
form.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
is
correct.
jacobs
inspected
the
alien’s
registration
receipt
card
and
also
he
found
a
social
security
card
which
had
been
produced
on
request
and
he
showed
both
the
cards
to
agent
beryl.
the
lighting
conditions
were
extremely
poor
and
on
this
viewing,
the
agents
found
nothing
in
it.
they
returned
the
documents
to
respondent
and
then
left
the
apartment
with
rico
who
had
by
then
collected
his
personal
effects.
now,
respondent
raises
no
objection
to
this
initial
inquiry
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
it
did
not
violate
respondent's
fifth
amendment
privilege.
this
initial
inquiry
occurred
in
what
the
court
of
appeals
characterized
as
“the
normal
immigration
inquiry
situation
and
that
is
what
permissible,
the
court
concluded,
since
the
card
served
the
non-criminal
purpose
of
an
enabling
the
government
to
be
aware
of
a
number
of
aliens
in
the
country
and
their
status.
when
the
agents
returned
with
rico
to
the
car,
a
third
investigator,
agent
white,
motioned
toward
another
individual
approaching
them
and
suggested
that
he
had
been
acting
--
he
had
acted
suspiciously
on
seeing
the
agent
and
should
be
questioned.
agent
beryl
spoke
to
this
individual,
jose
rodriguez
ortiz
and
inquired
as
to
his
citizenship.
ortiz
produced
an
alien
registration
receipt
card
which
upon
examination
both
beryl
and
white
found
to
be
altered.
ortiz
was
then
placed
under
arrest.
he
was
put
in
jacob’s
car
and
given
miranda
warning
in
spanish
by
jacobs.
he
was
asked
if
he
wanted
to
obtain
any
personal
belongings.
he
stated
that
he
did
and
indicated
that
he
lived
in
the
same
apartment
building
from
which
the
agent
had
just
emerged
with
rico.
agents
white
and
beryl
then
went
with
ortiz.
unexpectedly,
he
led
them
to
the
same
apartment
that
was
occupied
by
rico
and
respondent.
ortiz
opened
the
door
with
a
key
and
as
the
three
agents
--
and
as
the
three
men
entered,
respondent
came
out
of
the
back
room
into
the
living
room.
while
agent
white
accompanied
ortiz
into
his
room
to
collect
his
clothes,
agent
beryl
spoke
with
respondent
in
the
living
room.
he
explained
to
respondent
in
spanish
that
ortiz
was
under
arrest
and
was
being
permitted
to
collect
his
clothes.
then
agent
beryl
thinking
that
if
ortiz’s
card
was
altered,
there
was
a
possibility
that
respondent's
card
too
was
altered
and
recalling
that
its
earlier
inspect
--
earlier
inspection
of
respondent’s
card
had
been
in
the
dimly
living
room.
he
asked
to
see
respondent’s
registration
card,
alien
registration
receipt
card
again.
respondent
gave
him
the
card
and
beryl
examined
it
a
second
time.
the
card
was
shown
to
agent
white
and
both
agents
inspected
it
under
a
flashlight.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
no,
your
honor.
the
agent
could
not
compel
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
the
agent
could
have
appropriately
asked
for
the
card
and
in
this
case,
he
produced
the
card,
but
the
agents
had
no
authority
to
compel
him
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
he
might.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
not
directly.
no,
your
honor.
nothing
could
follow
and
in
these
circumstances
nothing
would
follow.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
i
suppose
could
well
be,
your
honor,
and
might
a
warrant
of
some
further
investigation
on
the
part
of
the
agents
as
to
this
subject,
but
in
terms
of
what
they
could
do
at
that
time,
they
were
in
--
they
had
no
authority
to
do
anything
more.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
no,
your
honor,
they
did
not
have
authority
to
arrest.
now
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
your
honor,
the
agent’s
authority
to
arrest
under
the
statute
arises,
an
immigration,
agent’s
authority,
arises
where
he
has
reason
to
believe
that
the
agent
is
in
the
country
unlawfully
and
that
the
agent
might
try
to
escape
or
flee.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
am
sorry,
the
alien.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
your
honor,
in
these
circumstances,
we
submit
that
there
was,
if
we
are
now
positing
that
the
card
had
not
been
produced,
there
was
not
reason
to
believe
in
these
circumstances
that
respondent
was
in
the
country
unlawfully.
nor
was
there
is
any
reason
to
believe
that
he
would
try
to
escape.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
your
honor
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
as
to
what
respondent
felt
the
record
is
silent
on
that.
i
do
not
think
it
is
unreasonable
to
assume
as
you
suggest
that
he
might
have
thought
that,
but
our
position
is
that
is
not
the
test
in
terms
of
whether
you
need
to
give
miranda
warnings
which
i
believe
is
the
question
you
are
directing
your
remarks
to.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
yes,
your
honor,
i
believe,
that
is
right.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
that
--
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
is
our
position,
your
honor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
believe
that
if
the
document
is
a
public
record,
it
does
not
make
any
difference
whether
miranda
warning,
whether
the
situation
was
custody
or
not
custody.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
because
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
but
your
honor,
if
it
is
a
public
record
then
you
are
not
--
if
it
is
a
required
record,
even
if
in
the
circumstances
here
you
would
say
that
there
was
custody
and
therefore
would
force
him
to
turn
it
over.
you
would
not
be
forcing
him
to
incriminate
himself
under
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
yes.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
yes.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
and
you
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
if
your
question
is
you
have
been
custody
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
it
is
a
--
i
think,
your
honor,
that
if
he
went
ahead
and
answered,
i
do
not
think
he
needs
to
answer
the
second
question.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
think
that
is
a
different
situation
then
if
he
does
show
the
card
and
the
card
is
a
document
which
is
a
required
record
such
as
a
driver’s
license
or
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
that
the
--
i
think
it
is
turns
on
the
state
statue
as
to
whether
or
not
you
have
to
show
him
on
the
request
that
you
have
to
turnover
the
driver’s
license
(voice
overlap)
but
i
think
in
most,
in
most
states
today
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
is
right.
and
if
you
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
actually,
he
would
not
know.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
no,
but
our
point
--
the
proposition
of
mr.
justice
white
is
it
that
the
man
is
in
a
custodial
situation
as
i
understand
here.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
if
the
card
is
a
required
reference
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
then
i
think
it
would
be
admissible
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
yes.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
that
is
correct
as
to
the
question
because
we
are
not
talking,
if
we
had
a
required
reference,
we
are
not
in
a
fifth
amendment
area
that
we
are
in,
in
terms
of
interrogation
that
you
were
positing
when
you
said,
“do
you
ask
the
question?”
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
is
the
--
applied
that
was
the
refusal
(inaudible)
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
it
maybe
requested
legitimately
under
the
law
properly
by
the
lawful
authority,
but
if
there
is
nothing
in
the
law
which
requires
that
he
produced
it,
at
the
time
of
that
request,
but
shapiro,
your
honor
i
believe,
suggested
that
if
you
have
a
record
which
is
required
to
be
kept
and
it
is
a
required
record,
that
then
if
an
officer
asked
for
the
record
that
you
--
the
law
would
assume
that
it
should
be
produced
under
the
required
reference
law.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
and
there
is
an
obligation
in
the
law
to
produce
it?
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
to
the
--
yes,
your
honor,
well,
in
that
respect,
yes.
i
assume
you
were
asking
whether
there
is
an
obligation
on
the
statute
to
produce
it
and
our
position
is
that,
if
they
required
reference
and
it
is
asked,
then
there
is
an
obligation
to
produce
it
without
the
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
answer
to
that
is
that
when
you
were
talking
in
the
miranda
area,
you’re
talking
apparently,
i
think
that
in
this
respect
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
not
in
the
miranda
sense,
your
honor
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
he
may
stop
him
i
believe
at
time
and
interrogate
him
as
to
whether
he
is
lawfully
in
the
united
states.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
that
miranda
defines
custody
as
meaning
focus.
i
think
that
what
miranda
said
quite
explicitly
is
that
focus
in
the
escobedo
sense
under
the
sixth
amendment
question
that
focus
means
custody
that
that
custody
does
not
mean
focus.
now,
our
position
is
that
in
the
first
instance
when
he
first
was
in
the
room
and
asked
the
initial
time,
that
was
not
in
custodial
situation
and
we
submit
that
there
is
nothing
at
the
second
--
on
the
second
occasion,
if
you
look
at
the
surrounding
circumstances
of
the
second
request,
that
would
have
changed
what
was
a
clearly
non-custodial
situation
into
a
custodial
situation.
now,
it
maybe
that
there
was
heighten
suspicion
on
the
part
of
the
agent,
not
probable
cause
--
but
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
the
alien
--
the
alien
was
--
well,
he
was
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
he
was
in
--
in
the
home.
the
agent
went
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
have
to
submit
that
he
would
have
been
--
but
he
was
not
deprived
from
freedom
of
action
in
any
significant
way
which
i
believe
is
a
miranda
test.
the
agent,
after
they
were
given
the
card
went
into
the
kitchen
and
left
the
respondent
alone
in
the
living
room
while
they
examined
the
card.
so
i
think
in
that
respect
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
am
not
saying
that.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
i
believe
that
if
you
have
a
non-custodial
situation
in
the
first
in
the
instance
that
what
the
agent
was
doing
even
though
there
was
heighten
suspicion
in
the
second
which
was,
they
were
making
the
routine
request,
i
mean,
a
routine
interrogation
as
to
whether
this
alien
was
lawfully
in
the
country.
it
was
no
less
no
routine
because
they
might
have
been
a
little
more
suspicious
that
he
had
a
forged
card,
he
was
still
trying
to
determine
whether
this
alien
was
lawfully
in
the
country
and
in
our
view
they
are
very
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
is
the
result
--
the
end
result
i
think.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
that
is
right
but
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
your
honor
that
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
is
a
determination
i
would
not
(voice
overlap).
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
am
not
the
--
but
i
think
that
when
you
are
trying
to
determine
whether
there
was
custody
in
the
miranda
situation
that
is
not
determined
by
what
subsequently
the
decision
might
be
as
to
whether
you
deport
this
alien
or
you
prosecute
a
criminal.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
that
is
a
reasonable
assumption.
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
that
is
a
possibility
whether
or
not
that
was
the
request
for
him
to
report
would
have
to
await
further
investigation
to
determine,
if
there
was
anything
on
file
that
indicated
that
he
had
lawfully
registered
that
those
intervening
circumstances
may
have
occurred,
but
i
think
that
that
might
possibly
be
one
of
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
that
that
does
--
that
that
is
a
practice.
i
would
like
to
say
just
a
word
about
the
--
the
public
of
the
required
record
document.
our
view
is
if
it
is
a
public
record
and
it
is
a
record
that
is
required
by
law
to
be
kept
in
the
possession
of
the
alien
for
very
legitimate
regulatory
purposes
and
in
that
sense
it
is
in
the
most
traditional
sense
within
the
required
records
document.
it
is
a
record
of
public
or
again
it
is
one
that
contains
information
that
is
public
in
nature,
that
is
information,
it
is
already
in
the
possession
of
his
government.
it
had
only
information
as
to
identity,
name,
sex,
date
of
birth,
his
alien
status,
his
registration
number,
his
photograph.
it
is
issued
pursuant
to
or
into
--
the
part
be
maintained
as
into
a
very
legitimate
regulatory
purpose
that
it
controlling
immigration
in
the
united
states.
now,
because
it
is
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
believe
that
the
shapiro
case
indicated
that
where
one
is
required
by
law
to
maintain
a
record
(voice
overlap)
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
he
has
a
duty
to
produce
it.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
believe
that
there
was
a
subpoena.
i
believe
--
i
am
not,
do
not
remember
that
is
on
the
request.
i
believe
it
was
a
subpoena
and
actually
it
was
a
request
for
sales
record
of
a
whole
seller.
the
element
in
shapiro
that
is
not
present
here
is
that
shapiro
was
addressed
to
what
are
essentially
private
records.
and
here
we
ask
what
are
in
a
most
traditional
sense
a
public
record
and
for
that
reason
the
additional
factor
that
was
suggest
in
shapiro
and
appeared
again
in
marchetti
and
grosso
that
is
if
the
record
be
as
a
kind
customarily
checked.
it
is
one
that
in
our
view
has
no
relevance
here,
is
that
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
that
of
course
raises
fourth
amendment
question
that
i
think
that
the
david
case
would
indicate
that
that
was
essentially
the
paper
requirement
that
we
are
talking
about.
whether
or
not
they
could
have
at
that
point
searched
them
or
whether
they
would
have
been
legal
process,
but
that
is
the
type
of
requirement.
davis
indicates
that
in
those
circumstances
where
you
are
dealing
with
a
public
record,
the
police
officer
may
well,
on
the
fourth
amendment
ground
be
able
to
go
a
little
further
than
he
would
normally
be
able
to
go
in
terms
of
obtaining
the
document.
but
i
think
that
is
essentially
probably
to
do
really
are
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
your
honor,
that
i
think
is
what
was
troubling
the
court
of
appeals.
the
required
record
document
turns
on
the
record-keeping
requirement,
possession
of
a
card
and
if
that
card,
under
the
statute
and
that
possession
of
keeping
requirement
is
one
that
is
not
aimed
at
a
highly
selective
group,
inherently
suspected
of
criminal
activity
which
we
maintain
is
the
case
here.
here
you
deal
with
all
aliens.
then
the
fact
that
--
in
this
particular
instance
we
are
dealing
with
a
forged
card,
is
not
enough
to
state
that
this
particular
case
has
the
required
record
document.
you
have
to
look
at
the
scheme,
statutory
scheme
and
see
where
the
scheme,
the
statutory
scheme
is
directed
--
is
at
criminal
activity
alone.
i
believe
that
was
the
threat
to
the
plurality
opinion
in
california
v.
fires
last
term
and
i
think
that
the
scheme
itself
is
important
and
if
in
this
particular
instance
the
respondent
is
maintaining
that
he
alone
because
he
acted
in
an
unlawful
manner,
he
would
have
to
incriminate
himself
by
producing
it.
that
does
not
take
the
doctrine
out
the
required
record.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
believe
that
in
the
document
that
that
is
so,
i
think,
your
honor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
it
was
in
response
to
a
request.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
we
did
deal
with
it
in
some
detail
in
our
reply
brief
that
that
turns,
your
honor
i
believe
on
the
history
of
the
statute,
the
legislative
history
and
the
background
of
this
particular
legislation.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
is
the
only
one
that
i
am
aware
of.
i
do
not
know
if
--
of
any
other
course
as
to
defense.
and
we
for
the
reasons
set
forth
in
the
reply
brief,
we
disagree
with
that
decision.
and
as
to
the
other
issues
that
were
also
raised
initially
in
their
answering
brief,
we
have
dealt
with
them
in
our
reply
brief,
i
was
relying
on
--
thank
you.
