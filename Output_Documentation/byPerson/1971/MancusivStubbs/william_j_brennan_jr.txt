justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
it
appear
mrs.
marcus
whether
any
offer
was
made
to
pay
the
expense?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
the
purpose
of
the
guest
defense
that
it
was
not
a
felony
murder?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
he
convicted
of
a
felony
murder
or
of
a
--?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
he
may
have
been
convicted
under
premeditated?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what's
the
significant
side
of
the
guest?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
would
the
evidence
have
supported
that
the
tennessee
supreme
court
said,
the
evidence
that
it
didn't
support
a
first
degree
common
law
premeditative?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
did!
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
this
--
you
are
arguing
harmless
error
--
guest
in
an
event?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
said,
he
took
the
stand
in
the
–
in
which
the
first
or
second
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
he
--
does
testimony
indicate
that
he
was
a
guest?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
cross
examination
of
stubbs?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
no,
when
stubbs
took
the
stand
that
he
offered
testimony,
from
which
a
guest
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
those
questions
in
this
record
mrs.
marcus?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
you
tell
us
what
page?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
73,
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
you
mean
mean
that's
a
rule
that
doesn't
require
in
any
instance
then
that
the
state
offer
to
pay
his
expenses
to
come?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
is
the
suggestion
that
the
no
inquiry
made
up
at
all
if
it's
discover
that
he
is
permanently
resident
of
overseas?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
does
the
duty
end,
what's
to
be
done
by
the
prosecutor?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
--
i
am
sorry
mrs.
marcus,
i
don't
understand
what
you
are
suggesting
should
be
the
constitutional
limit
of
the
prosecution
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
once
that's
established,
whether
it's
mexico,
canada,
no
matter
where
it
would
be,
that
that's
the
end
and
then
they
use
the
prior
testimony.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mrs.
marcus,
i
gather
--
in
this
instance,
the
only
issue
before
us
is
whether
the
state
did
what
it
should
have
done
to
bring
mr.
holm
back
for
the
second
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
apart
from
that,
on
the
basic
issue,
i
just
want
to
be
clear.
your
position
is
that
as
far
as
a
state
need
go
is,
that
is,
satisfy
itself
that
the
witness
permanently
resides
overseas
and
that
satisfies
any
constitutional
obligation
it
has?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes
because
he
was
living
in
some
foreign
country.
now
we
don't
agree
with
you,
i
gather
from
judge
friendly's
opinion,
he
thought
that
it
was
not
the
proper
test.
he
thought
that
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
adams,
i
am
sorry,
yes.
the
majority
opinion.
it's
page
27,
is
where
there
is
no
showing
that
the
witness
beyond
the
effect
of
reach
of
court's
subpoena
will
refuse
to
return
voluntarily
to
testify
if
requested.
so
under
that
test
there
would
have
to
be
an
inquiry
made
if
the
witness
resident
abroad
--
and
get
from
him
a
refusal
to
appear.
now
there
is
nothing
in
that
test
i
gather
which
suggests
that
there
should
also
be
an
offer
by
the
state
to
pay
the
expenses
of
the
witness
if
you
will.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
conclude.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
if
we
don't
agree
with
your
test,
but
think
that
the
test
suggested
by
judge
adams
is
the
more
appropriate
one
and
then
i
gather
there
can
be
a
reversal
only
if
we
agree
with
your
second
point
namely
on
harmless
error?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
were
both
in
the
back
seat?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
they
both
agree
on
that;
stubbs
and
holm
agreed
that
the
two
were
in
the
back
seat?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
this?
he
says
that
he
doesn’t
know
how
they
were
shot?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
who
had
to
struggle
to
get
it
away?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
did
he
get
it
away
from
mr.
holm?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
did
the
car
crash
in
fact?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
may
not,
but
certainly
confrontation
of
holm
was
had
when
he
took
the
stand
on
rebuttal,
wasn't
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
constitutionally,
stubbs
can’t
complain
that
he
didn't
have
an
opportunity
for
confrontation,
but
what
you
are
suggesting
is
that
it’s
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
aren’t
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
the
judge
miller
lead
into?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
well,
he
had
gather
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
new
york
doesn't
deny
this?
there
was
no
communication
directly
with
him
at
all,
at
least
on
the
part
of
any
tennessee
official?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
take
it
new
york
does
not
deny
--
i
thought
mrs.
marcus
didn't
answer
to
some
questions
i
asked
and
conceded
as
much?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
with
different
lawyers
at
the
second
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
at
what
page
is
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
what
proceeding
is
the
texas
conviction
being
litigated?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
case
was
resulted
in
what,
setting
aside
his
sentence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
whole
thing
could
washed
out?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
if
it's
found
against
him,
on
the
texas,
then
all
you
will
have
is
another
appeal
i
take
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
are
not
representing
him
in
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.

you

mr.

to
mr.

had
told

justice
william

mrs.

what's

an

where,
in
the

of

in

state
courts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no

isn't
the
condition

the
condition
was
that

justice
william
j.

jr.
well
that
satisfy
the

of

justice
william

well,
what

him
