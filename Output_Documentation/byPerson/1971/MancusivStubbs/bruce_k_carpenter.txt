mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
perhaps
in
order
to
clarify
the
questions
that
are
raised,
i
should
address
myself
first
to
what
happened,
the
facts
of
the
case
at
the
tennessee
trial
a
little
bit.
the
un-controverted
testimony
was
that
some
55
miles
away
from
the
homicide,
the
place
where
the
homicide
took
place,
in
another
part
of
tennessee,
stubbs
approached
mr.
and
mrs.
holm.
now
stubbs
was
hungry,
he
had
been
without
food.
his,
this
is
stubbs'
testimony,
for
some
time
he
was
desperate.
he
wanted
a
ride
to
get
up
to
new
york
where
he
had
relations.
as
he
approached
the
holms,
asked
them
for
a
ride,
was
refused,
went
away
and
then
he
said,
he
remembered
he
had
the
gun,
he
came
back,
forced
his
way
in
their
car.
he
drove,
they
were
in
the
back
seat
and
away
they
went.
now,
at
this
point,
of
course,
we
have
a
serious
misconduct.
now
the
testimony
of
stubbs
was
that
very
shortly,
after
this
trip
began
friendly
relations
began
to
exist
between
him
and
the
holms.
they
began
to
express
sympathy
for
his
condition
and
said,
if
you
had
only
asked
us
properly
for
a
ride,
we
would
have
given
you
one,
or
food.
so
that
this
is
stubbs
said
happened
about
four
miles
after
the
trip
began.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes,
he
did.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes.
now,
the
trip
continues.
they
pass
through
towns.
stubbs
says
that
pass
a
police
officer.
they
continue
on
their
way
and
all
of
a
sudden
--
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes.
at
the
request
of
mrs.
holm,
put
the
gun
down,
he
had
had
it,
he
said
in
his
lap;
then
the
testimony
was
he
put
it
on
the
seat
beside
him.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
no.
no,
he
did
not.
but
at
any
rate,
according
to
the
defense
point
of
view,
the
gun
was
on
the
side
of
his
seat,
beside
mr.
stubbs.
he
feels
that
friendly
relations
have
been
developed.
he
feels
at
ease
and
then
when
they
come
across
a
place
where
there
are
some
people
nearby.
according
to
holm,
stubbs
took
the
gun
and
turned
around
and
started
shooting
while
the
car
was
still
moving,
and
he
shot
the
wife
and
shot
mr.
holm
twice.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
they
were
both
in
the
back
seat.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
oh
yes!
yes,
there
is
no
question.
mrs.
holm
was
sitting
whereas
in
the
middle
there
was
some
luggage
off
to
the
left
and
mr.
holm
was
on
the
far
right.
now
stubbs
testified
that
he
did
not
shoot
anyone.
that
as
he
was
driving
he
was
suddenly
hit
on
the
head
presumably
by
the
gun
and
the
car
crashed
and
he
struggled
out
and
got
away
and
escaped.
now
the
trial
judge
in
tennessee
--
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
he
doesn't
know
how
they
were
shot.
he
presumes
that
--
he
says
mr.
holm
has
the
gun
and
he
had
to
struggle
to
get
it
away
and
then
--
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
stubbs
had
to
struggle.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
no,
because
the
gun
was
found
in
the
car,
the
backseat
of
the
car,
backseat
when
the
police
officer
(inaudible)
--
now
the
trial
judge--
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
the
car
didn't
crash.
it
went
off
the
road
and
wound
up
in
a
ditch,
pointing
in
the
same
direction
that
it
had
traveled.
the
trial
judge
charged
and
i
quoted
this
portion
in
the
appendix
to
the
brief,
it’s
not
finally
printed
in
the
record,
that
if
this
theory
were
accepted
by
the
jury,
they
should
acquit.
i
think
then
that
as
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not,
mr.
holm’s
testimony
was
crucial
or
devastating,
there
should
be
no
questions
in
the
case
as
to
that.
certainly,
there
was
no
other
witness.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
he
was
the
only
eye
witness
–
yes,
your
honor
and
he
was
the
only
witness
if
you
include
stubbs’
testimony
and
stubbs
being
present
in
the
car,
who
was
--
and
he
said
that
stubbs
had
done
the
shooting.
well,
certainly
this
is
different
from
those
cases
where
confrontation
is
considered
in
the
context
of
a
peripheral
statement
that
may
or
may
not
have
affected
the
outcome.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
it
was
not
adequately
explored
at
the
first
trial.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
it
was
explored
by
reason
of
mr.
stubbs’
testimony.
now
i
gather
--
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes.
the
transcript
of
the
first
trial,
i
just
had
occasion
to
read
it
last
week.
it
is
not
part
of
the
record
to
this
court,
i
will
leave
the
copy,
the
certified
copy
that
i
obtained
from
tennessee,
with
the
clerk,
but
holm
testified
first,
at
the
first
tennessee
trial.
he
was
the
first
witness,
and
my
impression
in
reading
that
transcript
is
that
the
counsel,
who
cross-examined
him
om
this
part
as
we
produced
in
the
appendix,
were
not
aware
of
the
defense
that
was
to
be
offered.
i
mean,
my
feeling
is
that
they
didn't
learn
of
this
until
stubbs
testified
and
told
his
story.
i
think
there
is
clear
indication,
but
of
the
fact
that
counsel
were
unprepared
at
this
first
trial.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
well
they
might
have,
but
this
case
involved
the
people
who
were
from
out
of
state,
people
that
were
not
local
people,
both
the
holms
and
stubbs.
the
counsel
perhaps
might
have
learned,
but
they
didn't.
at
any
rate
--
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
well
it’s
possible,
but
his
testimony
was
straightforward
at
both
trials.
to
this
there
was
no
conflict
over
the
years.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yeah,
i
should
think
here
they
might
have
done
so.
i
don't
know
the
problems
of
a
lawyer
who
is
preparing
a
defense,
that’s
difficult.
you
really
need
to
have
time
to
mull
over
things.
what’s
apparent
here,
at
the
site
when
we
had
plenty
of
chance
to
consider
the
record
and
explore
them
often,
these
matters
which
seem
so
clear
now,
are
not
so
clear
when
you
first
get
a
case.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes,
but
no
questions
were
asked.
well
there
--
three
questions
were
asked
as
to
story
that
an
attempt
was
made
to
impeach
mr.
holm
at
this
point,
an
abortive
attempt,
three
questions
were
asked
as
to
what
whether
he
had
told
a
conflicting
story
to
an
undertaker
and
it
never
really
reached
the
point
of
impeaching.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes,
well
of
course
it
is.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
what
the
judge
miller
say,
your
honor?
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes,
judge
miller
said
and
his
decision
is
appended
as
an
appendix
to
our
brief.
the
court
is
of
the
opinion
that
the
evidence
in
the
record
show
that
the
constitutional
rights
of
petitioner
stubbs
were
violated
at
the
time
of
his
trial
in
the
criminal
court
of
sullivan
county,
that’s
the
1954
trial,
in
that
his
court
appointed
counsel
did
not
have
adequate
and
sufficient
time
within
which
to
prepare
the
necessary
defense
prior
to
going
to
the
trial
and
as
a
result
the
petitioner
was
denied
the
effective
representation
by
counsel.
now
early
on
in
his
decision,
he
recites
that
he
considered
the
testimony
of
stubbs
and
the
entire
record,
and
to
reach
this
determination.
this
determination
was
not
apparently
questioned
by
the
tennessee
authorities.
they
acquiesced
in
this
decision
in
promptly
awarding
a
retrial
in
1964.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
well
i
--
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
then
as
in
barber
against
page,
assume
that
there
was
effective
cross-examination,
there
still
was
a
denial
of
confrontation.
there
was
a
denial
of
confrontation
because
the
prosecution
needed
to
make
a
good
faith
effort
to
obtain
the
presence
of
this
witness
holm
at
the
second
trial.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes.
in
fact,
there
is
an
indication
in
the
record
as
my
sister
pointed
out,
that
mr.
holm
was
not
even
apprised
of
the
fact
that
there
was
a
trial
pending.
he
didn't
even
know
about
it,
let
alone
be
asked
whether
he
wanted
to
come
to
the
trial,
let
alone
be
asked
whether
he
would
be
willing
to
come
--
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
there
is
a
further
indication
in
the
tennessee
record
that
counsel
had
been
informed
by
the
tennessee
prosecutor,
that
mr.
holm
would
be
produced.
at
least
they
--
one
lawyer
made
a
remark
and
it's
cited
in
the
page
reference,
it's
cited
in
the
brief
that
--
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes,
different
lawyers
and
different
set.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes,
it
was
a
remark
of
counsel
addressed
i
believe
when
the
jury
was
not
present.
so
that
it
isn’t
in
the
evidence.
in
any
event,
it
is
not
just
--
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
no,
but
i
think
that
they
indicated
most
strenuously
their
desire
to
have
the
witness
present
in
order
to
be
questioned.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
i
don't
recall
the
exact
wording
that
counsel
used.
i
got
the
impression
from
the
statements
of
counsel
that
they
wanted
the
witness
there.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
i
think
so.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
i
think,
they
might
have
asked,
but
this
remark
that
i
have
mentioned,
which
is
an
evidence
may
have
been
an
explanation
as
to
why
they
didn't.
they
expected
holm
to
be
there.
when
in
the
middle
of
the
trial
--
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes,
the
could
have.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes,
if
they
had
known
that
the
witness
holm
was
not
going
to
be
present.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
well
--
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
well
that,
this
of
course
would
be
the
devious
tactics
by
some
counsel.
perhaps
it
might
be
suggested
--
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
i
never
quoted
the
entire
passage
in
the
record,
which
is
not
printed
in
the
appendix,
where
counsel
before
the
testimony
was
offered,
made
their
objections.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
this
is
after
the
trial
was
once
underway.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes,
but
i
would
say
then,
the
passage
--
the
only
passage
that
addresses
in
the
record,
that
addresses
itself
to
this
point,
is
a
statement
by
mr.
mitchell,
one
of
stubbs'
counsel
at
the
second
trial.
and
he
says
--
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
page
16a
of
the
respondent's
brief
at
the
bottom.
it's
at
page
162
of
the
transcript
of
the
1964
trial.
your
honor,
please
i
think
it
is
the
law
and
it
is
the
law
until
the
court
speaks
otherwise.
now
as
your
honor
recalls
mr.
wilton
(ph)
who
was
the
prosecuting
attorney,
stated
that
he
would
have
mr.
holms,
and
a
holm
and
holms
are
interchangeable
spellings
of
the
same
were
present
and
then
there
is
a
three
dots
to
show
a
suspension,
that's
the
only
passage
in
the
record
that
speaks
of
it.
i
think
it
explains,
perhaps
why
counsel
did
not
move
for
an
adjournment
or
move
or
apply
to
have
the
witness
brought
over
at
the
counsel's
expense
or
since
stubbs
was
indigent
at
court
expense.
they
were,
i
think,
if
there
is
any
question,
the
only
indication
in
the
record
is
that
the
counsel
were
surprised.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
i
believe
there
was,
yes.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes,
they
relied
on
it
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
and
on
our,
when
opposing
our
certiorari
--
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes,
i
thought
that
the
case
might
be
moot
because
of
that
and
that
the
court
might
not
want
to
consider
the
case,
but
at
any
rate
new
york
--
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
well
they
would
have,
following
a
conviction
by
the
fact
finding.
the
prosecutor
lays
an
information,
and
it
is
possible
to
have
a
jury
trial
on
the
question
whether
the
defendant
is
the
same
person
that
was
convicted
and
it's
also
permissible
under
the
effective
new
york
statute
to
raise
the
question
as
to
whether
the
previous
conviction
was
constitutionally
obtained.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
this
went
forward
here,
following
his
conviction
in
monroe
county
and
the
only
conviction
that
was
used
was
the
tennessee
murder
conviction.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
well,
following
the
mandate
of
the
of
the
court
below.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes,
i
don't
know
whether
that
this
would
necessarily
make
him
a
felon,
but
my
information
is
that
he
was
in
fact
convicted
of
a
felony
in
texas
for
burglary.
whether
or
not
it
was
a
valid
conviction,
is
still
being
litigated
in
the
new
york
courts.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
well,
there
was
no
stay
of
proceedings
following
the
decision
below.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes,
in
this
case.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes,
that
he
was
ordered
released;
if
the
new
york
courts
did
not
resentence
him,
giving
no
effect
--
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yeah,
this
is
what
i
thought.
it
may
not
be
moot
because
if
stubbs
is
correct
in
his
contention
that
--
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes.
i
tried
to
ascertain
exactly
what
had
happened
and
may
be
my
researches
are
not
accurate.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
no,
the
monroe
county's
public
defender
has
been
in
communication
with
them.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
i
checked
--
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
i've
been
assigned
in
the
court
below
and
i
realizing
i
had
spent
1000
bucks,
excuse
me
your
honor,
dollars,
i
asked
the
clerk
to
assign
me
here
this
morning,
to
proceed.
i
think
to
return
to
the
analysis
of
the
case,
it's
a
complicated
case
and
we
have
to
go
from
here
to
here
to
discuss
the
parts
of
it,
and
not
that
the
effect
of
one
part
on
the
other
part.
i
think
that
you
don't,
this
court
does
not
need
to
enter
into
the
question,
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
effective
cross-examination
or
whether
there
was
harmless
error
in
the
representation
by
the
counsel
at
the
tennessee
trials.
if
the
court
determines
that
the
prosecution
in
tennessee
had
to
make
an
effort,
some
kind
of
an
effort
to
obtain
the
presence
of
the
witness
holm.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
i
think
the
only
effort
that
is
sufficient
when
you
have
an
indigent
defendant
is
an
offer
to
pay
the
expenses
aback
and
an
application.
i
would
suggest
--
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
well,
this
is
possible.
i
suppose
it
would
be
--
if
the
witness
refused
to
come
but
would
attend
a
deposition,
this
might
be
an
effective
substitute.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
in
this
you
have
to
transport
more
people
over
to
sweden
and
you
wouldn't
--
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
well,
i
don't
know.
i
think
if
you
are
representing
an
indigent,
counsel
probably
would
be
more
prudent
than
i
was
and
would
go
ahead
and
make
the
application
before
going
over
there
and
would
apply
for
reimbursement.
but
may
be
all
that's
necessary
is,
as
was
suggested
from
the
bench,
just
ask
the
witness
if
he
is
willing
to
come
back
at
his
own
expense.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
question
is
--
i'm
thinking
of
what
is
the
--
a
case
arose
in
california,
where
exactly
the
same
situation
occurred.
the
application
was
made
to
the
marine
court
and
the
legal
officer
told
the
investigator
--
the
police
officer
investigating
that
he
was
unavailable
and
it
was
determined
that
this
was
a
satisfactory
determination
that
the
witness
was
unavailable.
i
think
one
of
the
california
cases
is
cited
in
the
brief.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
no,
it
wasn't
--
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
well,
i
think
there
was
an
effort
made
to
get
the
witness.
an
answer
came
back
that
the
witness
was
unavailable.
this
is
far
cry
from
what
was
not
done
in
this
case.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes,
the
case
that
i
was
mentioning
or
which
is
in
the
fact
is
the
--
i
think
people
against
benjamin,
which
is
cited
sited
in
83
california
reporter
764,
an
intermediate
appellant
court
decision.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes,
there
was
cross-examination.
of
course,
the
decision
in
barber
expressly
made
the
effectiveness
of
the
cross-examination
not
a
factor
in
it,
but
so
that
the
precise
holding
in
barber
as
i
read
the
case
is
that
assuming
you
have
effective
cross-examination
or
assuming
cross-examination
is
not
at
issue,
that
is,
whether
or
not
the
transcript
that
you
are
going
to
use
of
the
absent
witness'
testimony
is
a
good
enough
transcript
to
use.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes,
and
another
fact
that
distinguishes
is
barber
and
page
distance
was
only
225
miles
and
it
was
just
one
straight
line,
but
these
facts,
because
i
don't
think
that
distance
here,
it's
4500
miles
or
so
to
sweden
make
--
is
a
determining
factor.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes,
i
would
think
that
barber
against
--
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes
your
honor,
because
the
right
of
confrontation
involves
not
merely
cross-examination,
but
also
the
right
of
a
defendant
to
have
his
fact-finder,
deal
with
the
witness,
face
to
face,
consider
that
the
demeanor
of
the
witness
as
he
is
giving
his
testimony
and
determine,
you
might
have
waive
it
or
give
it
up,
because
of
the
necessities
of
some
case,
but
it's
something
that
you
shouldn't
give
up
easily
--
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
i
think
it's
perhaps
possible
for
counsel
to
make
that
decision.
i
don't
think
it
would
be
dishonest
for
counsel
to
advice
a
client
to
better
let
the
testimony
be
read.
in
this
case,
there
was
no
hope.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
the
only
defense
tactics
that
would
have
worked
in
this
case
in
my
opinion
is
to
show
mr.
holm
to
have
been
a
liar;
that's
the
only
way
and
counsel
failed
to
do
anything
effective
in
the
1954
trial,
they
had
no
chance
to
do
it
in
the
1964
trial.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
perhaps
in
order
to
clarify
the
questions
that
are
raised,
i
should
address
myself
first
to
what
happened,
the
facts
of
the
case
at
the
tennessee
trial
a
little
bit.
the
un-controverted
testimony
was
that
some
55
miles
away
from
the
homicide,
the
place
where
the
homicide
took
place,
in
another
part
of
tennessee,
stubbs
approached
mr.
and
mrs.
holm.
now
stubbs
was
hungry,
he
had
been
without
food.
his,
this
is
stubbs'
testimony,
for
some
time
he
was
desperate.
he
wanted
a
ride
to
get
up
to
new
york
where
he
had
relations.
as
he
approached
the
holms,
asked
them
for
a
ride,
was
refused,
went
away
and
then
he
said,
he
remembered
he
had
the
gun,
he
came
back,
forced
his
way
in
their
car.
he
drove,
they
were
in
the
back
seat
and
away
they
went.
now,
at
this
point,
of
course,
we
have
a
serious
misconduct.
now
the
testimony
of
stubbs
was
that
very
shortly,
after
this
trip
began
friendly
relations
began
to
exist
between
him
and
the
holms.
they
began
to
express
sympathy
for
his
condition
and
said,
if
you
had
only
asked
us
properly
for
a
ride,
we
would
have
given
you
one,
or
food.
so
that
this
is
stubbs
said
happened
about
four
miles
after
the
trip
began.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes,
he
did.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes.
now,
the
trip
continues.
they
pass
through
towns.
stubbs
says
that
pass
a
police
officer.
they
continue
on
their
way
and
all
of
a
sudden
--
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes.
at
the
request
of
mrs.
holm,
put
the
gun
down,
he
had
had
it,
he
said
in
his
lap;
then
the
testimony
was
he
put
it
on
the
seat
beside
him.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
no.
no,
he
did
not.
but
at
any
rate,
according
to
the
defense
point
of
view,
the
gun
was
on
the
side
of
his
seat,
beside
mr.
stubbs.
he
feels
that
friendly
relations
have
been
developed.
he
feels
at
ease
and
then
when
they
come
across
a
place
where
there
are
some
people
nearby.
according
to
holm,
stubbs
took
the
gun
and
turned
around
and
started
shooting
while
the
car
was
still
moving,
and
he
shot
the
wife
and
shot
mr.
holm
twice.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
they
were
both
in
the
back
seat.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
oh
yes!
yes,
there
is
no
question.
mrs.
holm
was
sitting
whereas
in
the
middle
there
was
some
luggage
off
to
the
left
and
mr.
holm
was
on
the
far
right.
now
stubbs
testified
that
he
did
not
shoot
anyone.
that
as
he
was
driving
he
was
suddenly
hit
on
the
head
presumably
by
the
gun
and
the
car
crashed
and
he
struggled
out
and
got
away
and
escaped.
now
the
trial
judge
in
tennessee
--
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
he
doesn't
know
how
they
were
shot.
he
presumes
that
--
he
says
mr.
holm
has
the
gun
and
he
had
to
struggle
to
get
it
away
and
then
--
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
stubbs
had
to
struggle.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
no,
because
the
gun
was
found
in
the
car,
the
backseat
of
the
car,
backseat
when
the
police
officer
(inaudible)
--
now
the
trial
judge--
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
the
car
didn't
crash.
it
went
off
the
road
and
wound
up
in
a
ditch,
pointing
in
the
same
direction
that
it
had
traveled.
the
trial
judge
charged
and
i
quoted
this
portion
in
the
appendix
to
the
brief,
it’s
not
finally
printed
in
the
record,
that
if
this
theory
were
accepted
by
the
jury,
they
should
acquit.
i
think
then
that
as
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not,
mr.
holm’s
testimony
was
crucial
or
devastating,
there
should
be
no
questions
in
the
case
as
to
that.
certainly,
there
was
no
other
witness.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
he
was
the
only
eye
witness
–
yes,
your
honor
and
he
was
the
only
witness
if
you
include
stubbs’
testimony
and
stubbs
being
present
in
the
car,
who
was
--
and
he
said
that
stubbs
had
done
the
shooting.
well,
certainly
this
is
different
from
those
cases
where
confrontation
is
considered
in
the
context
of
a
peripheral
statement
that
may
or
may
not
have
affected
the
outcome.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
it
was
not
adequately
explored
at
the
first
trial.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
it
was
explored
by
reason
of
mr.
stubbs’
testimony.
now
i
gather
--
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes.
the
transcript
of
the
first
trial,
i
just
had
occasion
to
read
it
last
week.
it
is
not
part
of
the
record
to
this
court,
i
will
leave
the
copy,
the
certified
copy
that
i
obtained
from
tennessee,
with
the
clerk,
but
holm
testified
first,
at
the
first
tennessee
trial.
he
was
the
first
witness,
and
my
impression
in
reading
that
transcript
is
that
the
counsel,
who
cross-examined
him
om
this
part
as
we
produced
in
the
appendix,
were
not
aware
of
the
defense
that
was
to
be
offered.
i
mean,
my
feeling
is
that
they
didn't
learn
of
this
until
stubbs
testified
and
told
his
story.
i
think
there
is
clear
indication,
but
of
the
fact
that
counsel
were
unprepared
at
this
first
trial.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
well
they
might
have,
but
this
case
involved
the
people
who
were
from
out
of
state,
people
that
were
not
local
people,
both
the
holms
and
stubbs.
the
counsel
perhaps
might
have
learned,
but
they
didn't.
at
any
rate
--
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
well
it’s
possible,
but
his
testimony
was
straightforward
at
both
trials.
to
this
there
was
no
conflict
over
the
years.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yeah,
i
should
think
here
they
might
have
done
so.
i
don't
know
the
problems
of
a
lawyer
who
is
preparing
a
defense,
that’s
difficult.
you
really
need
to
have
time
to
mull
over
things.
what’s
apparent
here,
at
the
site
when
we
had
plenty
of
chance
to
consider
the
record
and
explore
them
often,
these
matters
which
seem
so
clear
now,
are
not
so
clear
when
you
first
get
a
case.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes,
but
no
questions
were
asked.
well
there
--
three
questions
were
asked
as
to
story
that
an
attempt
was
made
to
impeach
mr.
holm
at
this
point,
an
abortive
attempt,
three
questions
were
asked
as
to
what
whether
he
had
told
a
conflicting
story
to
an
undertaker
and
it
never
really
reached
the
point
of
impeaching.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes,
well
of
course
it
is.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
what
the
judge
miller
say,
your
honor?
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes,
judge
miller
said
and
his
decision
is
appended
as
an
appendix
to
our
brief.
the
court
is
of
the
opinion
that
the
evidence
in
the
record
show
that
the
constitutional
rights
of
petitioner
stubbs
were
violated
at
the
time
of
his
trial
in
the
criminal
court
of
sullivan
county,
that’s
the
1954
trial,
in
that
his
court
appointed
counsel
did
not
have
adequate
and
sufficient
time
within
which
to
prepare
the
necessary
defense
prior
to
going
to
the
trial
and
as
a
result
the
petitioner
was
denied
the
effective
representation
by
counsel.
now
early
on
in
his
decision,
he
recites
that
he
considered
the
testimony
of
stubbs
and
the
entire
record,
and
to
reach
this
determination.
this
determination
was
not
apparently
questioned
by
the
tennessee
authorities.
they
acquiesced
in
this
decision
in
promptly
awarding
a
retrial
in
1964.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
well
i
--
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
then
as
in
barber
against
page,
assume
that
there
was
effective
cross-examination,
there
still
was
a
denial
of
confrontation.
there
was
a
denial
of
confrontation
because
the
prosecution
needed
to
make
a
good
faith
effort
to
obtain
the
presence
of
this
witness
holm
at
the
second
trial.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes.
in
fact,
there
is
an
indication
in
the
record
as
my
sister
pointed
out,
that
mr.
holm
was
not
even
apprised
of
the
fact
that
there
was
a
trial
pending.
he
didn't
even
know
about
it,
let
alone
be
asked
whether
he
wanted
to
come
to
the
trial,
let
alone
be
asked
whether
he
would
be
willing
to
come
--
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
there
is
a
further
indication
in
the
tennessee
record
that
counsel
had
been
informed
by
the
tennessee
prosecutor,
that
mr.
holm
would
be
produced.
at
least
they
--
one
lawyer
made
a
remark
and
it's
cited
in
the
page
reference,
it's
cited
in
the
brief
that
--
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes,
different
lawyers
and
different
set.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes,
it
was
a
remark
of
counsel
addressed
i
believe
when
the
jury
was
not
present.
so
that
it
isn’t
in
the
evidence.
in
any
event,
it
is
not
just
--
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
no,
but
i
think
that
they
indicated
most
strenuously
their
desire
to
have
the
witness
present
in
order
to
be
questioned.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
i
don't
recall
the
exact
wording
that
counsel
used.
i
got
the
impression
from
the
statements
of
counsel
that
they
wanted
the
witness
there.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
i
think
so.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
i
think,
they
might
have
asked,
but
this
remark
that
i
have
mentioned,
which
is
an
evidence
may
have
been
an
explanation
as
to
why
they
didn't.
they
expected
holm
to
be
there.
when
in
the
middle
of
the
trial
--
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes,
the
could
have.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes,
if
they
had
known
that
the
witness
holm
was
not
going
to
be
present.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
well
--
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
well
that,
this
of
course
would
be
the
devious
tactics
by
some
counsel.
perhaps
it
might
be
suggested
--
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
i
never
quoted
the
entire
passage
in
the
record,
which
is
not
printed
in
the
appendix,
where
counsel
before
the
testimony
was
offered,
made
their
objections.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
this
is
after
the
trial
was
once
underway.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes,
but
i
would
say
then,
the
passage
--
the
only
passage
that
addresses
in
the
record,
that
addresses
itself
to
this
point,
is
a
statement
by
mr.
mitchell,
one
of
stubbs'
counsel
at
the
second
trial.
and
he
says
--
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
page
16a
of
the
respondent's
brief
at
the
bottom.
it's
at
page
162
of
the
transcript
of
the
1964
trial.
your
honor,
please
i
think
it
is
the
law
and
it
is
the
law
until
the
court
speaks
otherwise.
now
as
your
honor
recalls
mr.
wilton
(ph)
who
was
the
prosecuting
attorney,
stated
that
he
would
have
mr.
holms,
and
a
holm
and
holms
are
interchangeable
spellings
of
the
same
were
present
and
then
there
is
a
three
dots
to
show
a
suspension,
that's
the
only
passage
in
the
record
that
speaks
of
it.
i
think
it
explains,
perhaps
why
counsel
did
not
move
for
an
adjournment
or
move
or
apply
to
have
the
witness
brought
over
at
the
counsel's
expense
or
since
stubbs
was
indigent
at
court
expense.
they
were,
i
think,
if
there
is
any
question,
the
only
indication
in
the
record
is
that
the
counsel
were
surprised.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
i
believe
there
was,
yes.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes,
they
relied
on
it
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
and
on
our,
when
opposing
our
certiorari
--
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes,
i
thought
that
the
case
might
be
moot
because
of
that
and
that
the
court
might
not
want
to
consider
the
case,
but
at
any
rate
new
york
--
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
well
they
would
have,
following
a
conviction
by
the
fact
finding.
the
prosecutor
lays
an
information,
and
it
is
possible
to
have
a
jury
trial
on
the
question
whether
the
defendant
is
the
same
person
that
was
convicted
and
it's
also
permissible
under
the
effective
new
york
statute
to
raise
the
question
as
to
whether
the
previous
conviction
was
constitutionally
obtained.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
this
went
forward
here,
following
his
conviction
in
monroe
county
and
the
only
conviction
that
was
used
was
the
tennessee
murder
conviction.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
well,
following
the
mandate
of
the
of
the
court
below.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes,
i
don't
know
whether
that
this
would
necessarily
make
him
a
felon,
but
my
information
is
that
he
was
in
fact
convicted
of
a
felony
in
texas
for
burglary.
whether
or
not
it
was
a
valid
conviction,
is
still
being
litigated
in
the
new
york
courts.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
well,
there
was
no
stay
of
proceedings
following
the
decision
below.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes,
in
this
case.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes,
that
he
was
ordered
released;
if
the
new
york
courts
did
not
resentence
him,
giving
no
effect
--
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yeah,
this
is
what
i
thought.
it
may
not
be
moot
because
if
stubbs
is
correct
in
his
contention
that
--
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes.
i
tried
to
ascertain
exactly
what
had
happened
and
may
be
my
researches
are
not
accurate.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
no,
the
monroe
county's
public
defender
has
been
in
communication
with
them.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
i
checked
--
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
i've
been
assigned
in
the
court
below
and
i
realizing
i
had
spent
1000
bucks,
excuse
me
your
honor,
dollars,
i
asked
the
clerk
to
assign
me
here
this
morning,
to
proceed.
i
think
to
return
to
the
analysis
of
the
case,
it's
a
complicated
case
and
we
have
to
go
from
here
to
here
to
discuss
the
parts
of
it,
and
not
that
the
effect
of
one
part
on
the
other
part.
i
think
that
you
don't,
this
court
does
not
need
to
enter
into
the
question,
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
effective
cross-examination
or
whether
there
was
harmless
error
in
the
representation
by
the
counsel
at
the
tennessee
trials.
if
the
court
determines
that
the
prosecution
in
tennessee
had
to
make
an
effort,
some
kind
of
an
effort
to
obtain
the
presence
of
the
witness
holm.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
i
think
the
only
effort
that
is
sufficient
when
you
have
an
indigent
defendant
is
an
offer
to
pay
the
expenses
aback
and
an
application.
i
would
suggest
--
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
well,
this
is
possible.
i
suppose
it
would
be
--
if
the
witness
refused
to
come
but
would
attend
a
deposition,
this
might
be
an
effective
substitute.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
in
this
you
have
to
transport
more
people
over
to
sweden
and
you
wouldn't
--
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
well,
i
don't
know.
i
think
if
you
are
representing
an
indigent,
counsel
probably
would
be
more
prudent
than
i
was
and
would
go
ahead
and
make
the
application
before
going
over
there
and
would
apply
for
reimbursement.
but
may
be
all
that's
necessary
is,
as
was
suggested
from
the
bench,
just
ask
the
witness
if
he
is
willing
to
come
back
at
his
own
expense.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
question
is
--
i'm
thinking
of
what
is
the
--
a
case
arose
in
california,
where
exactly
the
same
situation
occurred.
the
application
was
made
to
the
marine
court
and
the
legal
officer
told
the
investigator
--
the
police
officer
investigating
that
he
was
unavailable
and
it
was
determined
that
this
was
a
satisfactory
determination
that
the
witness
was
unavailable.
i
think
one
of
the
california
cases
is
cited
in
the
brief.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
no,
it
wasn't
--
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
well,
i
think
there
was
an
effort
made
to
get
the
witness.
an
answer
came
back
that
the
witness
was
unavailable.
this
is
far
cry
from
what
was
not
done
in
this
case.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes,
the
case
that
i
was
mentioning
or
which
is
in
the
fact
is
the
--
i
think
people
against
benjamin,
which
is
cited
sited
in
83
california
reporter
764,
an
intermediate
appellant
court
decision.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes,
there
was
cross-examination.
of
course,
the
decision
in
barber
expressly
made
the
effectiveness
of
the
cross-examination
not
a
factor
in
it,
but
so
that
the
precise
holding
in
barber
as
i
read
the
case
is
that
assuming
you
have
effective
cross-examination
or
assuming
cross-examination
is
not
at
issue,
that
is,
whether
or
not
the
transcript
that
you
are
going
to
use
of
the
absent
witness'
testimony
is
a
good
enough
transcript
to
use.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes,
and
another
fact
that
distinguishes
is
barber
and
page
distance
was
only
225
miles
and
it
was
just
one
straight
line,
but
these
facts,
because
i
don't
think
that
distance
here,
it's
4500
miles
or
so
to
sweden
make
--
is
a
determining
factor.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes,
i
would
think
that
barber
against
--
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
yes
your
honor,
because
the
right
of
confrontation
involves
not
merely
cross-examination,
but
also
the
right
of
a
defendant
to
have
his
fact-finder,
deal
with
the
witness,
face
to
face,
consider
that
the
demeanor
of
the
witness
as
he
is
giving
his
testimony
and
determine,
you
might
have
waive
it
or
give
it
up,
because
of
the
necessities
of
some
case,
but
it's
something
that
you
shouldn't
give
up
easily
--
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
i
think
it's
perhaps
possible
for
counsel
to
make
that
decision.
i
don't
think
it
would
be
dishonest
for
counsel
to
advice
a
client
to
better
let
the
testimony
be
read.
in
this
case,
there
was
no
hope.
mr.
bruce
k.
carpenter
the
only
defense
tactics
that
would
have
worked
in
this
case
in
my
opinion
is
to
show
mr.
holm
to
have
been
a
liar;
that's
the
only
way
and
counsel
failed
to
do
anything
effective
in
the
1954
trial,
they
had
no
chance
to
do
it
in
the
1964
trial.
thank
you
very
much.
