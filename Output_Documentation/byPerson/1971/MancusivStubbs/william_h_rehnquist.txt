justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
suppose
as
a
matter
of
tennessee's
state
law,
if
the
judge
charges
the
jury
that
they
may
find
him
guilty
of
first-degree
murder
on
either
theories.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that
it
turns
out
that
one
of
the
theories
might
not
have
been
supported
evidentially,
that
would
be
reversible
even
though
on
the
other
theory
were
adequately
supported?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ten
years
closer
to
the
event
i
take
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mrs.
marcus
i
take
it
it's
your
position,
the
state
of
new
york
is
not
bound
by
judge
miller's
habeas
corpus
ruling?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
didn't
stubbs
also
offer
the
explanation
when
he
is
first
apprehended
that
he
had
fallen
off
a
cliff
while
he
was
fishing
and
that
was
how
that
happened?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
take
it
all
they
would
have
had
to
do
to
learn
of
the
defense
was
to
interview
their
own
client.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
wasn’t
really
admissible
evidence
though,
was
it,
wasn't
that
a
statement
of
counsel
that
trial
judge
refused
to
consider?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
his
counsel
is
claiming,
i
suppose
of
that,
that
kind
of
conviction
too
was
unconstitutional?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
carpenter,
i
take
it
you
are
relying
on
barber
against
page
for
your
main
proposition
and
there
is
at
least
a
factual
distinction
between
this
case
and
barber,
isn't
there,
in
that
in
barber
nobody
cross-examined
on
behalf
of
the
particular
defendant
who
later
raised
the
objection?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
whereas
here
there
was
cross-examination
on
behalf
of
your
client
in
the
1954
trial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
the
holding
though
kind
of
limited
to
the
fact;
when
you
are
speaking
about
holding,
you
are
talking
about
the
facts
of
