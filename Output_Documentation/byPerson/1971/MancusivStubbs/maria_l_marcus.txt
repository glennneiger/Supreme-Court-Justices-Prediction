ms.
maria
l.
marcus
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
habeas
corpus
proceeding
presents
the
question
of
whether
new
york
is
prohibited
from
using
a
1964
tennessee
murder
conviction
as
a
predicate
for
increased
punishment.
this
tennessee
conviction
resulted
from
a
retrial
where
the
prior
recorded
testimony
of
a
witness
was
read
into
the
record
because
the
witness
had
since
moved
to
sweden.
to
state
briefly
the
history
of
the
tennessee
and
new
york
proceedings,
the
crime
of
which
respondent
stubbs
was
convicted
was
a
1954
murder
of
mrs.
alex
holm.
stubbs
met
mr.
and
mrs.
holm,
an
elderly
swedish
couple
who
were
strangers
to
him
at
a
road
side
picnic
table.
he
kidnapped
them
at
gunpoint
and
ultimately
murdered
mrs.
holm
and
seriously
wounded
her
husband.
at
stubbs'
1954
trial,
defendant
was
represented
by
three
appointed
counsel.
alex
holm
testified
as
did
stubbs
himself
and
stubbs
was
convicted
of
first
degree
murder,
kidnapping
and
assault
with
intent
to
murder.
nine
years
later,
stubbs
moved
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
district
court
in
tennessee
asking
that
his
conviction
be
vacated
on
the
grounds
that
his
attorneys
were
appointed
three
days
before
trial.
the
district
court
under
a
former
circuit
court
rule,
which
required
automatic
reversal
in
cases
of
tardy
appointment
of
counsel,
vacated
stubbs'
first
trial
and
remanded
him
for
possible
retrial.
at
the
second
trial
in
1964,
the
prosecutor
sent
a
subpoena
to
alex
holm's
former
address,
a
farm
in
in
texas,
which
was
returned
unsigned
and
he
also
contacted
holm's
son,
who
advised
the
court
that
his
father
was
now
a
permanent
resident
of
sweden.
his
son
took
the
stand
and
so
testified.
the
prior
testimony
of
holm
was
then
read
into
the
record
over
objections
by
counsel.
stubbs
was
among
the
witnesses
who
testified.
he
was
convicted
of
first
degree
murder.
the
conviction
was
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
and
affirmed.
after
his
release
from
the
tennessee
prison,
he
went
to
monroe
county,
new
york,
where
he
was
arrested
and
convicted
for
first
degree
assault
and
possession
of
a
firearm.
based
upon
the
predicate
of
the
tennessee
conviction,
his
sentence
as
second
felony
offender
was
32-34
years.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
well,
when
he
appealed
his
conviction
to
the
tennessee
supreme
court,
they
gave
him
credit
for
the
10-year
period
between
trials
and
apparently
he
served
only
about
two
more
years
and
it's
not
explained
exactly
why
he
was
paroled
at
that
point
but
that's
apparently
what
happened.
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
challenging
both
convictions
was
filed
in
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
new
york,
which
denied
the
petition.
the
second
circuit,
which
had
granted
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
solely
on
the
grounds
of
the
validity
of
the
tennessee
conviction
reverse
the
district
court.
the
court
below
held
that
respondent
had
been
deprived
of
his
right
of
confrontation
at
the
tennessee
retrial
because
due
diligence
had
not
been
exercised
to
obtain
the
presence
of
the
absent
witness
before
the
testimony
of
alex
holm
was
read
into
the
record
and
because
counsel
of
the
first
trial
had
been
tardily
appointed
and
had
not
questioned
holm
about
whether
after
stubbs
had
kidnapped
the
holms
at
gunpoint,
they
had
made
him
welcome
as
their
guest.
this
absence
of
questioning
on
the
guest
theory;
the
majority
held
it
could
not
be
harmless
error.
the
dissenting
judge
leonard
p.
moore
called
the
majority
decision
an
extraordinary
example
of
justice
dispensed
by
the
federal
courts.
we
urge
reversal
of
the
decision
below
on
three
grounds.
first,
that
there
was
no
lack
of
due
diligence
in
obtaining
presence
of
the
witness.
second,
that
even
assuming
that
due
diligence
was
not
exercised,
the
error
in
this
case
would
have
been
harmless.
and
third,
the
tardy
appointment
of
counsel
at
the
first
trial
did
not
in
fact,
deprive
respondent
stubbs
of
effective
legal
assistance.
barber
versus
page
was
not
violated
by
the
use
of
testimony
of
the
witness
permanently
domiciled
in
a
foreign
continent.
this
court
in
barber
versus
page,
ruled
that
a
good
faith
effort
must
be
made
to
have
a
witness
present,
prior
to
reading
his
testimony
into
the
record
at
another
trial.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that.
of
course,
this
was
not
only
before
this
court
decided
barber,
but
even
before
this
court
decided
pointer.
however,
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
it
would
have
been
greatly
to
the
prosecutor's
advantage
to
have
this
witness
at
the
trial,
simply
because
he
was
a
victim
to
a
very,
very
tragic
circumstance;
his
wife
had
been
murdered,
he
himself,
was
shot
twice
in
the
face,
and
of
course
the
sympathetic
effect
of
such
testimony
in
the
jury,
would
have
been
much
greater
than
simply
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
yes,
i
think
that's
why
the
court
below
seized
on
that.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
he
was
convicted
of
first
degree
murder.
the
judge
charged
both
felony
murder
and
common
law
murder.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
yes.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
apparently,
the
court
below
felt
that
since
stubbs
himself
testified
to
the
ownership
of
the
gun
and
the
fact
that
he
kidnapped
the
holms
and
compelled
them
to
drive
to
the
spot
where
the
shooting
occurred,
but
he
said
that
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
oh,
yes.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
yes.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
alright,
we
are
arguing
at
any
event
that
as
far
as
harmless
error
is
concerned
that
the
guest
theory
has
no
relation,
because
in
fact
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
in
respect
to
the
exercise
of
due
diligence,
1964
counsel
didn't
indicate
that
if
the
witness
had
been
there,
they
would
have
asked
him
any
questions
about
the
guest
theory
at
all.
second,
the
guest
theory
was
completely
refuted
by
the
record
because
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
he
took
the
stand
in
the
first
trial.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
--
quite
the
contrary.
what
holm
was
asked
on
rebuttal
by
the
prosecutor,
did
relations
ever
become
friendly
between
you
and
your
kidnapper
and
he
replied,
“no
sir,
there
was
no
friendly
relation”
so
that
the
court
erroneously
assumed
that
there
was
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
that
no,
this
was
--
and
now
i
am
speaking
of
alex
holm,
he
made
this
reply.
there
was
a
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
the
testimony
that
he
offered
was
that
mrs.
holm,
when
he
was
pointing
the
pistol
in
her
face,
asked
him
to
put
the
pistol
down,
and
that
she
would
give
him
no
trouble
and
i
think
there
was
an
attempt
by
1954
counsel
to
say
that
this
was
an
expression
of
friendship.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
it
was
hinted
at
by
virtue
of
his
saying,
they
told
me
they
would
give
me
no
trouble.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
it
was
not
any
finding
that
on
a
record
counsel
was
ineffective
but
because
of
a
rule
mandating
automatic
reversal
in
cases
where
counsel
was
tardily
appointed.
now
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
in
this
case,
in
the
first
place
the
record
shows
that
the
cross-examination
was
capably
handled
as
was
the
direct
examination.
also,
as
the
tennessee
supreme
court
pointed
out,
it's
very
difficult
to
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
the
court
of
appeals,
it
made
no
reference
whatsoever
to
lack
of
preparation
time
or
the
kind
of
questions
that
could
have
been
asked
except
for
the
guest
theory.
that
was
the
only
basis
on
which
harmless
error
was
rejected,
but
not
only
does
the
record
show,
that
stubbs
was
effectively
represented
by
three
counsel
by
the
way,
not
only
one.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
i
think
the
record
helps
a
great
deal
though
because
in
reading
it's
clear
that
--
in
fact,
i
think
what
makes
it
clear
again
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
we
were
given
a
little
assistance
as
to
what
would
have
happened
because
1964
counsel
read
into
the
record
the
questions
that
they
would
have
asked.
it's
first
notable
that
they
made
no
mention
of
the
guest
theory
whatsoever,
and
second
notable
that
there
was
a
lot
of
time
to
research
into
holms'
past
life,
they
didn't
discover
anything
about
his
background,
which
could
have
formed
the
basis
for
cross
examination.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
they
said,
they
read
into
the
record
and
it
is
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
no,
but
they
listed
the
questions
that
they
would
have
asked,
and
said
and
they
further
added
there
might
have
been
other
questions
but
these
were
the
ones
that
on
the
basis
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
they
are
indeed,
yes.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
it's
on
page
73.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
well,
the
court
below
felt
that
it
might
have
helped
the
defendant
because
if
stubbs'
testimony,
since
he
said
on
a
stand
that
he
kidnapped
the
holms
at
gunpoint
and
compelled
them
to
drive
to
the
spot
where
the
shooting
occurred;
this
evidence
was
rather
overwhelming,
and
the
court
below
thought
the
guest
theory
might
show
that
if
there
was
a
felony
which
come
to
an
end,
that
there
might
be
more
to
say
about
the
circumstances
of
a
shooting,
i
think
that's
why
they
brought
in
the
guest
theory.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
well,
it
was
a
first
degree
murder
conviction.
the
judge
charged
both
felony
murder
and
premeditated
murder.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
that
was
the
idea
i
think
that
the
court
below
had.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
well,
it
would
have
helped
him
simply
on
a
felony
murder
as
had
been
on
the
first
degree
murder
aspect.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
it's
apparently
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
on
either
grounds,
it
could
have
included
either
one.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
in
barber,
this
court
discussed
the
reading
of
preliminary
hearing
testimony
of
a
witness
who
was
in
a
federal
prison
across
the
state
border.
the
court
pointed
out
that
increased
cooperation
between
the
states
and
the
federal
government
meant
that
state
process
could
cross
a
state
border,
and
that
states
could
issue
writs
of
habeas
corpus
ad
testificandum
that
federal
courts
have
the
power
to
issue
such
writs
at
the
request
of
state
prosecutorial
authorities.
this
court
has
in
fact
never
ruled
on
the
question
of
what
good
faith
means
in
the
context
of
witness
who
is
not
in
the
united
states
or
in
a
territory
of
the
united
states,
but
is
beyond
the
reach
of
compulsory
process,
by
a
state
prosecutor.
however,
a
number
of
state
court
and
lower
court
decisions,
federal
decisions,
indicate
that
proof
that
a
witness
is
living
on
a
foreign
continent
at
the
time
of
trial
is
sufficient
to
establish
unavailability
and
cases
in
which
it
has
been
found
that
due
diligence
was
not
exercised,
have
been
those
in
which
the
witness
might
had
been
in
the
jurisdiction.
we
ask
this
court
not
to
extend
barber
versus
page
to
overseas
witnesses
beyond
the
stage
reached
by
compulsory
process,
but
instead
to
a
adopt
the
rationale
already
set
out
by
many
courts
that
good
faith
in
an
oversees
witness
is
shown
by
establishing
that
he
is
resident
there.
now
respondent
attempts
two
countervailing
arguments
here.
first,
that
the
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
it
wouldn't
establish
a
constitutional
duty
to
do
so
where
the
witness
is
beyond
the
reach
of
compulsory
process.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
the
suggestion
is
that
it
wouldn't
be
a
part
of
the
constitutional
duty
of
the
prosecutor
to
do
so.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
well,
as
far
as
--
well
the
prosecutor
may
in
cases
for
example
where
the
travel
expenses
are
not
too
onerous,
he
may
well
feel
that
having
the
witness
present
would
be
to
his
advantage
and
he
would
pursue
it
regardless
of
what
the
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
the
establishment
of
his
residence
overseas
as
far
as
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
as
far
as
this
constitutional
duty
is
concerned,
yes.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
i
think
that
where
there
is
no
compulsory
process
to
back
this
up,
we
ask
this
court
to
say
that
the
limit
of
the
duty
would
be
the
establishment
that
the
witness
is
living
overseas,
and
that
is
the
rationale
that
these
other
courts
have
adopted.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
well,
if
he
is
willing
to
come
and
the
prosecutor
is
aware
of
that
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
under
the
rule
that
these
courts
have
established,
that
would
be
in
the
prosecutor's
discretion
rather
than
a
constitutional
duty.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
no,
they
didn't.
they
objected
to
the
witness
out
being
there,
but
there
was
no
reference
to
an
allowance
of
any
kind.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
no,
in
other
words
the
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
well,
the
prior
hearing
testimony
was
taken
at
a
trial
where
the
witness
holm
was
confronted,
was
cross-examined
so
that
this
testimony
i
think
would
have
been
the
most
valid
that
they
possibly
could
read
into
the
record.
it
was
taken
at
the
first
trial,
under
the
usual
circumstances.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
it
was
directly
after
the
event,
yes.
now
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
yes.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
right.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
they
then
have
taken
his
son,
who
advised
the
court
as
to
his
whereabouts
and
who
testified
on
the
stand
as
to
his
whereabouts.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
yes.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
there
was
a
remark
by
1964
defense
counsel
that
the
court
in
referring
to
a
newspaper
interview
where
holm's
son
was
quoted
to
saying
his
father
was
not
aware
that
the
trial
is
taking
place,
but
even
if
this
process
was
excluded
as
hearsay
by
the
judge,
but
it's
interesting
to
note
that
1964
defense
counsel
made
no
effort
to
cross-examine
the
son
on
a
stand
as
to
whether
or
not
his
father
knew,
so
that
there
is
nothing
to
record
really,
no
proper
evidence
on
that.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
as
far,
except
for
the
establishment
of
where
he
was.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
right.
now
respondent
argues
here
that
the
walsh
act
which
is
28
u.s.c.
1783
could
somehow
have
been
employed
to
subpoena
this
witness.
that
statute
only
empowered
a
federal
court
to
bring
a
witness
before
itself,
where
the
united
states
attorney
general
or
someone
acting
under
his
direction
so
desired.
it
could
not
authorize
a
state
prosecutor
to
bring
a
witness
to
a
state
trail.
indeed
our
research
and
a
call
to
the
office
of
the
untied
states
attorney
for
the
southern
district
has
never
revealed
any
case
and
which
has
been
used
by
state
prosecutor
to
secure
witness
in
a
state
trial.
thus
it
would
have
been
more
than
due
diligence,
it
would
have
been
a
height
of
ingenuity
for
the
prosecutor
to
have
thought
of
that
and
it
would
have
been
unusable.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
right,
and
this
--
there
was
an
attempt
by
respondent
to
argue
that
new
york
is
in
privity
with
tennessee
and
therefore,
this
ruling
would
prevent
us
from
looking
at
the
record
at
all
to
determine
whether
counsel
was
effective
or
not.
now
this
privity
theory
might
have
some
interest
if
we
are
relying
on
the
1954
conviction
as
a
predicate.
that
was
what
was
vacated,
but
in
point
of
fact
we're
relying
on
a
1964
conviction,
which
was
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee,
and
which
included
a
ruling
that
the
cross-examination
was
effective.
moreover,
the
district
court
never
even
considered
whether
counsel
in
fact
conducted
a
proper
cross-examination
because
it
was
a
operating
on
a
per
se
rule
that
made
that
kind
of
inquiry
unnecessary.
so
they
never
dealt
with
the
question
at
all
of
whether
the
1954
counsel's
cross-examination
was
effective
or
not.
it
did
it
merely
on
a
per
se
rule,
which
this
court
in
chambers
versus
maroney
has
since
rejected.
this
court
in
chambers
held
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
counsel
is
tardily
appointed
doesn't
even
call
for
a
hearing
necessarily
much
less
automatic
reversal.
it
calls
for
inquiry
into
the
record
to
find
out
whether
in
fact
there
was
effective
representation.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
even
assuming
that
the
state
should
have
sent
a
request
to
the
witness
prior
to
reading
his
testimony
in
the
record,
there
in
this
case
would
have
been
harmless
because
the
outcome
of
the
trial
would
have
been
the
same,
whether
the
state
had
communicated
with
holm
or
not.
if
the
letter
had
been
sent
to
holm
and
he
had
refused
to
come
to
tennessee,
his
prior
testimony
would
have
been
read
into
the
record
at
the
second
trial.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
if
he
had
agreed
to
come,
i
believe
that
it's
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
he
would
have
testified
the
same
way
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
facts
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
well,
he
--
as
i
said
he
did
list
what
he
would
have
had
but
i
think
there
are
other
reasons
to
conclude
that
he
would
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
have
testified
the
same
way.
but
first
of
all,
the
facts
were
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
yes,
i
think
that
he
would.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
i
think
though
that
looking
at
this
record
and
this
witness,
what
we
can
say
is
that
the
witness
would
have
withstood
cross-examination.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
no,
no
your
honor.
but.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
the
question
would
be
how
would
the
witness
have
reacted
to
this
cross-examination
and
the
testimony
was
uncomplicated.
stubbs
was
a
strong
witness
to
a
tragic
situation
with
no
motive
to
lie.
stubbs
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
holm,
yes.
stubbs'
identity,
the
ownership
of
the
gun
and
the
fact
of
the
kidnapping
were
corroborated
by
stubbs
himself
and
moreover
holm
could
have
refreshed
his
recollection
by
reading
his
prior
testimony
from
the
earlier
trial.
and
1964
counsel
with
plenty
of
time
to
research
into
holm's
background
did
not
find
anything
upon
which
to
base
new
questions.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
he
testified
at
both
trials
and
he
reiterated
that
when
he
was
released
from
the
texas
prison,
he
tried
for
several
days
going
toward
bristol,
tennessee,
where
he
hoped
to
meet
a
truck
route
going
to
new
york.
he
encountered
mr.
and
mrs.
alex
holm,
he
had
a
gun,
which
he
had
been
given
by
a
friend,
he
had
no
money,
no
job
prospects.
he
said
that
he
kidnapped
the
holms'
at
gunpoint.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
this
is
his
testimony
at
both
trials.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
kidnapped
the
holms'
at
gunpoint
and
with
his
left-hand
holding
the
gun
at
intervals
pointing
into
mrs.
holm's
face.
they
drove
on
until
near
bristol,
tennessee,
he
testified
that
he
saw
a
tree
in
a
reddish
haze.
he
heard
a
loud
bang,
he
felt
a
pain,
he
thought
that
holm
must
have
gotten
the
gun
away
from
him
and
then
stubbs
fled
from
the
car.
now
stubbs
testimony
about
his
subsequent
flight,
the
blood
on
his
clothes,
the
roadblock
at
which
he
was
arrested
and
a
hospital
room
identification
in
which
holm
pointed
to
him
in
the
presence
of
a
number
of
police
officers
and
said
this
is
the
man
that
killed
my
wife
and
shot
me.
that's
subsequent
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
yes,
he
had
head
wounds
because
holm
had
hit
him
several
times
with
the
gun
on
the
head,
once
having
seized
it.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
there
was
some
testimony
that
a
bullet
might
have
graced
him,
yes.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
yes,
he
told
that
--
it
was
the
first
story
that
he
told
the
police
officers
that
the
blood
was
there
only
because
he
had
an
accident
while
fishing
and
he
had
slipped
on
a
cliff.
the
disputed
testimony
of
alex
holm
of
course
parallel
that
of
stubbs
himself
as
to
the
fact
that
stubbs
had
kidnapped
them
and
compelled
them
to
drive
to
the
spot
where
the
shooting
occurred.
now
the
hospital
room
identification
was
not
objected
to
and
the
police
officers
testified
in
court
at
both
trials
as
to
that
identification.
i
have
pointed
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
well,
even
if
not,
it
would
have
been
harmless
error
in
the
context
of
the
overwhelming
evidence
in
this
case.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
insofar
as
a
witness
is
resident
beyond
the
reach
of
compulsory
process.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
judge
adams'
opinion,
your
honor?
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
no,
he
made
no
mention
of
that
and
then
he
ultimately
on
our
second
point,
which
was
that
the
evidence
here
is
so
overwhelming
with
the
hospital
identification.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
sure.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
yes,
that's
right.
i
would
like
to
reserve
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
he
has
been
resentenced
as
a
second
felony
offender
under
the
texas
predicate
and
he
is
appealing
that
texas
predicate.
however,
regardless
of
the
outcome
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
in
new
york
state
courts,
yes,
first.
regardless
of
the
outcome
of
that
appeal,
there
still
would
be
no
mootness
in
this
case
because
this
court
held
in
sibron
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
yes,
but
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
it
does
not
for
the
considerations
that
this
court
discussed
in
sibron
v.
new
york
and
the
morgan
case.
the
fact
of
collateral
disabilities
and
more
important
under
new
york
law,
upon
a
subsequent
conviction,
the
judge
has
a
right
to
consider
the
whole
history
of
this
defendant
and
the
kind
of
crimes
which
he
has
committed
before
and
has
a
discretion
to
resentence
him
to
a
life-sentence
and
of
course,
any
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
the
sentence
here
is
not
different,
but
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
both
sibron
and
morgan,
it
must
be
considered
what
would
happen
on
a
subsequent
conviction
and
what
would
happen
is
that
the
sentencing
court
would
undoubtedly
regard
as
crucial
in
determining
what
kind
of
person
this
is,
what
sort
of
chances
for
rehabilitation
and
what
sort
of
danger
he
poses
to
the
public
in
being
released.
a
brutal
murder
of
this
kind
committed
seven
days
after
release
from
the
texas
penitentiary,
he
would
undoubtedly
be
central
to
the
sentencing
court
and
so
under
the
considerations
of
this
court
set
out
in
sibron
and
morgan,
the
case
cannot
be
moot.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
habeas
corpus
proceeding
presents
the
question
of
whether
new
york
is
prohibited
from
using
a
1964
tennessee
murder
conviction
as
a
predicate
for
increased
punishment.
this
tennessee
conviction
resulted
from
a
retrial
where
the
prior
recorded
testimony
of
a
witness
was
read
into
the
record
because
the
witness
had
since
moved
to
sweden.
to
state
briefly
the
history
of
the
tennessee
and
new
york
proceedings,
the
crime
of
which
respondent
stubbs
was
convicted
was
a
1954
murder
of
mrs.
alex
holm.
stubbs
met
mr.
and
mrs.
holm,
an
elderly
swedish
couple
who
were
strangers
to
him
at
a
road
side
picnic
table.
he
kidnapped
them
at
gunpoint
and
ultimately
murdered
mrs.
holm
and
seriously
wounded
her
husband.
at
stubbs'
1954
trial,
defendant
was
represented
by
three
appointed
counsel.
alex
holm
testified
as
did
stubbs
himself
and
stubbs
was
convicted
of
first
degree
murder,
kidnapping
and
assault
with
intent
to
murder.
nine
years
later,
stubbs
moved
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
district
court
in
tennessee
asking
that
his
conviction
be
vacated
on
the
grounds
that
his
attorneys
were
appointed
three
days
before
trial.
the
district
court
under
a
former
circuit
court
rule,
which
required
automatic
reversal
in
cases
of
tardy
appointment
of
counsel,
vacated
stubbs'
first
trial
and
remanded
him
for
possible
retrial.
at
the
second
trial
in
1964,
the
prosecutor
sent
a
subpoena
to
alex
holm's
former
address,
a
farm
in
in
texas,
which
was
returned
unsigned
and
he
also
contacted
holm's
son,
who
advised
the
court
that
his
father
was
now
a
permanent
resident
of
sweden.
his
son
took
the
stand
and
so
testified.
the
prior
testimony
of
holm
was
then
read
into
the
record
over
objections
by
counsel.
stubbs
was
among
the
witnesses
who
testified.
he
was
convicted
of
first
degree
murder.
the
conviction
was
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
and
affirmed.
after
his
release
from
the
tennessee
prison,
he
went
to
monroe
county,
new
york,
where
he
was
arrested
and
convicted
for
first
degree
assault
and
possession
of
a
firearm.
based
upon
the
predicate
of
the
tennessee
conviction,
his
sentence
as
second
felony
offender
was
32-34
years.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
well,
when
he
appealed
his
conviction
to
the
tennessee
supreme
court,
they
gave
him
credit
for
the
10-year
period
between
trials
and
apparently
he
served
only
about
two
more
years
and
it's
not
explained
exactly
why
he
was
paroled
at
that
point
but
that's
apparently
what
happened.
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
challenging
both
convictions
was
filed
in
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
new
york,
which
denied
the
petition.
the
second
circuit,
which
had
granted
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
solely
on
the
grounds
of
the
validity
of
the
tennessee
conviction
reverse
the
district
court.
the
court
below
held
that
respondent
had
been
deprived
of
his
right
of
confrontation
at
the
tennessee
retrial
because
due
diligence
had
not
been
exercised
to
obtain
the
presence
of
the
absent
witness
before
the
testimony
of
alex
holm
was
read
into
the
record
and
because
counsel
of
the
first
trial
had
been
tardily
appointed
and
had
not
questioned
holm
about
whether
after
stubbs
had
kidnapped
the
holms
at
gunpoint,
they
had
made
him
welcome
as
their
guest.
this
absence
of
questioning
on
the
guest
theory;
the
majority
held
it
could
not
be
harmless
error.
the
dissenting
judge
leonard
p.
moore
called
the
majority
decision
an
extraordinary
example
of
justice
dispensed
by
the
federal
courts.
we
urge
reversal
of
the
decision
below
on
three
grounds.
first,
that
there
was
no
lack
of
due
diligence
in
obtaining
presence
of
the
witness.
second,
that
even
assuming
that
due
diligence
was
not
exercised,
the
error
in
this
case
would
have
been
harmless.
and
third,
the
tardy
appointment
of
counsel
at
the
first
trial
did
not
in
fact,
deprive
respondent
stubbs
of
effective
legal
assistance.
barber
versus
page
was
not
violated
by
the
use
of
testimony
of
the
witness
permanently
domiciled
in
a
foreign
continent.
this
court
in
barber
versus
page,
ruled
that
a
good
faith
effort
must
be
made
to
have
a
witness
present,
prior
to
reading
his
testimony
into
the
record
at
another
trial.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that.
of
course,
this
was
not
only
before
this
court
decided
barber,
but
even
before
this
court
decided
pointer.
however,
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
it
would
have
been
greatly
to
the
prosecutor's
advantage
to
have
this
witness
at
the
trial,
simply
because
he
was
a
victim
to
a
very,
very
tragic
circumstance;
his
wife
had
been
murdered,
he
himself,
was
shot
twice
in
the
face,
and
of
course
the
sympathetic
effect
of
such
testimony
in
the
jury,
would
have
been
much
greater
than
simply
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
yes,
i
think
that's
why
the
court
below
seized
on
that.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
he
was
convicted
of
first
degree
murder.
the
judge
charged
both
felony
murder
and
common
law
murder.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
yes.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
apparently,
the
court
below
felt
that
since
stubbs
himself
testified
to
the
ownership
of
the
gun
and
the
fact
that
he
kidnapped
the
holms
and
compelled
them
to
drive
to
the
spot
where
the
shooting
occurred,
but
he
said
that
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
oh,
yes.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
yes.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
alright,
we
are
arguing
at
any
event
that
as
far
as
harmless
error
is
concerned
that
the
guest
theory
has
no
relation,
because
in
fact
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
in
respect
to
the
exercise
of
due
diligence,
1964
counsel
didn't
indicate
that
if
the
witness
had
been
there,
they
would
have
asked
him
any
questions
about
the
guest
theory
at
all.
second,
the
guest
theory
was
completely
refuted
by
the
record
because
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
he
took
the
stand
in
the
first
trial.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
--
quite
the
contrary.
what
holm
was
asked
on
rebuttal
by
the
prosecutor,
did
relations
ever
become
friendly
between
you
and
your
kidnapper
and
he
replied,
“no
sir,
there
was
no
friendly
relation”
so
that
the
court
erroneously
assumed
that
there
was
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
that
no,
this
was
--
and
now
i
am
speaking
of
alex
holm,
he
made
this
reply.
there
was
a
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
the
testimony
that
he
offered
was
that
mrs.
holm,
when
he
was
pointing
the
pistol
in
her
face,
asked
him
to
put
the
pistol
down,
and
that
she
would
give
him
no
trouble
and
i
think
there
was
an
attempt
by
1954
counsel
to
say
that
this
was
an
expression
of
friendship.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
it
was
hinted
at
by
virtue
of
his
saying,
they
told
me
they
would
give
me
no
trouble.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
it
was
not
any
finding
that
on
a
record
counsel
was
ineffective
but
because
of
a
rule
mandating
automatic
reversal
in
cases
where
counsel
was
tardily
appointed.
now
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
in
this
case,
in
the
first
place
the
record
shows
that
the
cross-examination
was
capably
handled
as
was
the
direct
examination.
also,
as
the
tennessee
supreme
court
pointed
out,
it's
very
difficult
to
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
the
court
of
appeals,
it
made
no
reference
whatsoever
to
lack
of
preparation
time
or
the
kind
of
questions
that
could
have
been
asked
except
for
the
guest
theory.
that
was
the
only
basis
on
which
harmless
error
was
rejected,
but
not
only
does
the
record
show,
that
stubbs
was
effectively
represented
by
three
counsel
by
the
way,
not
only
one.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
i
think
the
record
helps
a
great
deal
though
because
in
reading
it's
clear
that
--
in
fact,
i
think
what
makes
it
clear
again
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
we
were
given
a
little
assistance
as
to
what
would
have
happened
because
1964
counsel
read
into
the
record
the
questions
that
they
would
have
asked.
it's
first
notable
that
they
made
no
mention
of
the
guest
theory
whatsoever,
and
second
notable
that
there
was
a
lot
of
time
to
research
into
holms'
past
life,
they
didn't
discover
anything
about
his
background,
which
could
have
formed
the
basis
for
cross
examination.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
they
said,
they
read
into
the
record
and
it
is
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
no,
but
they
listed
the
questions
that
they
would
have
asked,
and
said
and
they
further
added
there
might
have
been
other
questions
but
these
were
the
ones
that
on
the
basis
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
they
are
indeed,
yes.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
it's
on
page
73.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
well,
the
court
below
felt
that
it
might
have
helped
the
defendant
because
if
stubbs'
testimony,
since
he
said
on
a
stand
that
he
kidnapped
the
holms
at
gunpoint
and
compelled
them
to
drive
to
the
spot
where
the
shooting
occurred;
this
evidence
was
rather
overwhelming,
and
the
court
below
thought
the
guest
theory
might
show
that
if
there
was
a
felony
which
come
to
an
end,
that
there
might
be
more
to
say
about
the
circumstances
of
a
shooting,
i
think
that's
why
they
brought
in
the
guest
theory.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
well,
it
was
a
first
degree
murder
conviction.
the
judge
charged
both
felony
murder
and
premeditated
murder.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
that
was
the
idea
i
think
that
the
court
below
had.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
well,
it
would
have
helped
him
simply
on
a
felony
murder
as
had
been
on
the
first
degree
murder
aspect.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
it's
apparently
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
on
either
grounds,
it
could
have
included
either
one.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
in
barber,
this
court
discussed
the
reading
of
preliminary
hearing
testimony
of
a
witness
who
was
in
a
federal
prison
across
the
state
border.
the
court
pointed
out
that
increased
cooperation
between
the
states
and
the
federal
government
meant
that
state
process
could
cross
a
state
border,
and
that
states
could
issue
writs
of
habeas
corpus
ad
testificandum
that
federal
courts
have
the
power
to
issue
such
writs
at
the
request
of
state
prosecutorial
authorities.
this
court
has
in
fact
never
ruled
on
the
question
of
what
good
faith
means
in
the
context
of
witness
who
is
not
in
the
united
states
or
in
a
territory
of
the
united
states,
but
is
beyond
the
reach
of
compulsory
process,
by
a
state
prosecutor.
however,
a
number
of
state
court
and
lower
court
decisions,
federal
decisions,
indicate
that
proof
that
a
witness
is
living
on
a
foreign
continent
at
the
time
of
trial
is
sufficient
to
establish
unavailability
and
cases
in
which
it
has
been
found
that
due
diligence
was
not
exercised,
have
been
those
in
which
the
witness
might
had
been
in
the
jurisdiction.
we
ask
this
court
not
to
extend
barber
versus
page
to
overseas
witnesses
beyond
the
stage
reached
by
compulsory
process,
but
instead
to
a
adopt
the
rationale
already
set
out
by
many
courts
that
good
faith
in
an
oversees
witness
is
shown
by
establishing
that
he
is
resident
there.
now
respondent
attempts
two
countervailing
arguments
here.
first,
that
the
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
it
wouldn't
establish
a
constitutional
duty
to
do
so
where
the
witness
is
beyond
the
reach
of
compulsory
process.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
the
suggestion
is
that
it
wouldn't
be
a
part
of
the
constitutional
duty
of
the
prosecutor
to
do
so.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
well,
as
far
as
--
well
the
prosecutor
may
in
cases
for
example
where
the
travel
expenses
are
not
too
onerous,
he
may
well
feel
that
having
the
witness
present
would
be
to
his
advantage
and
he
would
pursue
it
regardless
of
what
the
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
the
establishment
of
his
residence
overseas
as
far
as
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
as
far
as
this
constitutional
duty
is
concerned,
yes.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
i
think
that
where
there
is
no
compulsory
process
to
back
this
up,
we
ask
this
court
to
say
that
the
limit
of
the
duty
would
be
the
establishment
that
the
witness
is
living
overseas,
and
that
is
the
rationale
that
these
other
courts
have
adopted.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
well,
if
he
is
willing
to
come
and
the
prosecutor
is
aware
of
that
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
under
the
rule
that
these
courts
have
established,
that
would
be
in
the
prosecutor's
discretion
rather
than
a
constitutional
duty.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
no,
they
didn't.
they
objected
to
the
witness
out
being
there,
but
there
was
no
reference
to
an
allowance
of
any
kind.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
no,
in
other
words
the
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
well,
the
prior
hearing
testimony
was
taken
at
a
trial
where
the
witness
holm
was
confronted,
was
cross-examined
so
that
this
testimony
i
think
would
have
been
the
most
valid
that
they
possibly
could
read
into
the
record.
it
was
taken
at
the
first
trial,
under
the
usual
circumstances.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
it
was
directly
after
the
event,
yes.
now
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
yes.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
right.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
they
then
have
taken
his
son,
who
advised
the
court
as
to
his
whereabouts
and
who
testified
on
the
stand
as
to
his
whereabouts.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
yes.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
there
was
a
remark
by
1964
defense
counsel
that
the
court
in
referring
to
a
newspaper
interview
where
holm's
son
was
quoted
to
saying
his
father
was
not
aware
that
the
trial
is
taking
place,
but
even
if
this
process
was
excluded
as
hearsay
by
the
judge,
but
it's
interesting
to
note
that
1964
defense
counsel
made
no
effort
to
cross-examine
the
son
on
a
stand
as
to
whether
or
not
his
father
knew,
so
that
there
is
nothing
to
record
really,
no
proper
evidence
on
that.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
as
far,
except
for
the
establishment
of
where
he
was.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
right.
now
respondent
argues
here
that
the
walsh
act
which
is
28
u.s.c.
1783
could
somehow
have
been
employed
to
subpoena
this
witness.
that
statute
only
empowered
a
federal
court
to
bring
a
witness
before
itself,
where
the
united
states
attorney
general
or
someone
acting
under
his
direction
so
desired.
it
could
not
authorize
a
state
prosecutor
to
bring
a
witness
to
a
state
trail.
indeed
our
research
and
a
call
to
the
office
of
the
untied
states
attorney
for
the
southern
district
has
never
revealed
any
case
and
which
has
been
used
by
state
prosecutor
to
secure
witness
in
a
state
trial.
thus
it
would
have
been
more
than
due
diligence,
it
would
have
been
a
height
of
ingenuity
for
the
prosecutor
to
have
thought
of
that
and
it
would
have
been
unusable.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
right,
and
this
--
there
was
an
attempt
by
respondent
to
argue
that
new
york
is
in
privity
with
tennessee
and
therefore,
this
ruling
would
prevent
us
from
looking
at
the
record
at
all
to
determine
whether
counsel
was
effective
or
not.
now
this
privity
theory
might
have
some
interest
if
we
are
relying
on
the
1954
conviction
as
a
predicate.
that
was
what
was
vacated,
but
in
point
of
fact
we're
relying
on
a
1964
conviction,
which
was
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee,
and
which
included
a
ruling
that
the
cross-examination
was
effective.
moreover,
the
district
court
never
even
considered
whether
counsel
in
fact
conducted
a
proper
cross-examination
because
it
was
a
operating
on
a
per
se
rule
that
made
that
kind
of
inquiry
unnecessary.
so
they
never
dealt
with
the
question
at
all
of
whether
the
1954
counsel's
cross-examination
was
effective
or
not.
it
did
it
merely
on
a
per
se
rule,
which
this
court
in
chambers
versus
maroney
has
since
rejected.
this
court
in
chambers
held
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
counsel
is
tardily
appointed
doesn't
even
call
for
a
hearing
necessarily
much
less
automatic
reversal.
it
calls
for
inquiry
into
the
record
to
find
out
whether
in
fact
there
was
effective
representation.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
even
assuming
that
the
state
should
have
sent
a
request
to
the
witness
prior
to
reading
his
testimony
in
the
record,
there
in
this
case
would
have
been
harmless
because
the
outcome
of
the
trial
would
have
been
the
same,
whether
the
state
had
communicated
with
holm
or
not.
if
the
letter
had
been
sent
to
holm
and
he
had
refused
to
come
to
tennessee,
his
prior
testimony
would
have
been
read
into
the
record
at
the
second
trial.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
if
he
had
agreed
to
come,
i
believe
that
it's
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
he
would
have
testified
the
same
way
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
facts
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
well,
he
--
as
i
said
he
did
list
what
he
would
have
had
but
i
think
there
are
other
reasons
to
conclude
that
he
would
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
have
testified
the
same
way.
but
first
of
all,
the
facts
were
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
yes,
i
think
that
he
would.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
i
think
though
that
looking
at
this
record
and
this
witness,
what
we
can
say
is
that
the
witness
would
have
withstood
cross-examination.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
no,
no
your
honor.
but.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
the
question
would
be
how
would
the
witness
have
reacted
to
this
cross-examination
and
the
testimony
was
uncomplicated.
stubbs
was
a
strong
witness
to
a
tragic
situation
with
no
motive
to
lie.
stubbs
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
holm,
yes.
stubbs'
identity,
the
ownership
of
the
gun
and
the
fact
of
the
kidnapping
were
corroborated
by
stubbs
himself
and
moreover
holm
could
have
refreshed
his
recollection
by
reading
his
prior
testimony
from
the
earlier
trial.
and
1964
counsel
with
plenty
of
time
to
research
into
holm's
background
did
not
find
anything
upon
which
to
base
new
questions.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
he
testified
at
both
trials
and
he
reiterated
that
when
he
was
released
from
the
texas
prison,
he
tried
for
several
days
going
toward
bristol,
tennessee,
where
he
hoped
to
meet
a
truck
route
going
to
new
york.
he
encountered
mr.
and
mrs.
alex
holm,
he
had
a
gun,
which
he
had
been
given
by
a
friend,
he
had
no
money,
no
job
prospects.
he
said
that
he
kidnapped
the
holms'
at
gunpoint.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
this
is
his
testimony
at
both
trials.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
kidnapped
the
holms'
at
gunpoint
and
with
his
left-hand
holding
the
gun
at
intervals
pointing
into
mrs.
holm's
face.
they
drove
on
until
near
bristol,
tennessee,
he
testified
that
he
saw
a
tree
in
a
reddish
haze.
he
heard
a
loud
bang,
he
felt
a
pain,
he
thought
that
holm
must
have
gotten
the
gun
away
from
him
and
then
stubbs
fled
from
the
car.
now
stubbs
testimony
about
his
subsequent
flight,
the
blood
on
his
clothes,
the
roadblock
at
which
he
was
arrested
and
a
hospital
room
identification
in
which
holm
pointed
to
him
in
the
presence
of
a
number
of
police
officers
and
said
this
is
the
man
that
killed
my
wife
and
shot
me.
that's
subsequent
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
yes,
he
had
head
wounds
because
holm
had
hit
him
several
times
with
the
gun
on
the
head,
once
having
seized
it.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
there
was
some
testimony
that
a
bullet
might
have
graced
him,
yes.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
yes,
he
told
that
--
it
was
the
first
story
that
he
told
the
police
officers
that
the
blood
was
there
only
because
he
had
an
accident
while
fishing
and
he
had
slipped
on
a
cliff.
the
disputed
testimony
of
alex
holm
of
course
parallel
that
of
stubbs
himself
as
to
the
fact
that
stubbs
had
kidnapped
them
and
compelled
them
to
drive
to
the
spot
where
the
shooting
occurred.
now
the
hospital
room
identification
was
not
objected
to
and
the
police
officers
testified
in
court
at
both
trials
as
to
that
identification.
i
have
pointed
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
well,
even
if
not,
it
would
have
been
harmless
error
in
the
context
of
the
overwhelming
evidence
in
this
case.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
insofar
as
a
witness
is
resident
beyond
the
reach
of
compulsory
process.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
judge
adams'
opinion,
your
honor?
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
no,
he
made
no
mention
of
that
and
then
he
ultimately
on
our
second
point,
which
was
that
the
evidence
here
is
so
overwhelming
with
the
hospital
identification.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
sure.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
yes,
that's
right.
i
would
like
to
reserve
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
he
has
been
resentenced
as
a
second
felony
offender
under
the
texas
predicate
and
he
is
appealing
that
texas
predicate.
however,
regardless
of
the
outcome
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
in
new
york
state
courts,
yes,
first.
regardless
of
the
outcome
of
that
appeal,
there
still
would
be
no
mootness
in
this
case
because
this
court
held
in
sibron
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
yes,
but
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
it
does
not
for
the
considerations
that
this
court
discussed
in
sibron
v.
new
york
and
the
morgan
case.
the
fact
of
collateral
disabilities
and
more
important
under
new
york
law,
upon
a
subsequent
conviction,
the
judge
has
a
right
to
consider
the
whole
history
of
this
defendant
and
the
kind
of
crimes
which
he
has
committed
before
and
has
a
discretion
to
resentence
him
to
a
life-sentence
and
of
course,
any
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
the
sentence
here
is
not
different,
but
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
both
sibron
and
morgan,
it
must
be
considered
what
would
happen
on
a
subsequent
conviction
and
what
would
happen
is
that
the
sentencing
court
would
undoubtedly
regard
as
crucial
in
determining
what
kind
of
person
this
is,
what
sort
of
chances
for
rehabilitation
and
what
sort
of
danger
he
poses
to
the
public
in
being
released.
a
brutal
murder
of
this
kind
committed
seven
days
after
release
from
the
texas
penitentiary,
he
would
undoubtedly
be
central
to
the
sentencing
court
and
so
under
the
considerations
of
this
court
set
out
in
sibron
and
morgan,
the
case
cannot
be
moot.
