justice
thurgood
marshall
mrs.
marcus
let
me
back
up
a
minute.
the
first
conviction
was
offset
because
of
ineffective
counsel?
justice
thurgood
marshall
don't
you
think
that's
different
from
the
average
case,
because
i
would
assume
that
if
counsel
had
more
time,
he
might
have
been
able
to
ask
more
questions
on
cross-examination.
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
the
court
of
appeals
find
that
to
be
true?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
if
i
remember
correctly
in
scottsboro
(ph)
trial,
they
had
27
counsels,
and
this
court
offset
that,
so
the
number
doesn't
help?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
see
i
have
great
difficulty
in
looking
at
the
record,
and
deciding
as
to
what
somebody
would
say
on
the
second
hearing?
i
assume
that
the
second
trial,
the
lawyer
looks
at
the
record
of
the
first
trial,
and
finds
gee
i
should
have
asked
that
question
and
he
then
has
the
opportunity
to
ask
him,
but
he
didn't
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
how
do
you
know
what
they
might
have
wanted
to
ask
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
read
into
the
record
and
they
couldn't
think
of
another
question
they
would
have
wanted
to
ask,
if
he
had
been
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
doesn't
even
require
him
to
send
a
letter
to
say,
if
you
don't
mind,
would
you
mind
coming
over
to
testify?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
even
if
the
witness
is
willing
to
come
over
his
own
expense?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
would
know
unless
–
i
am
just
saying
that
he
wouldn't
embarrassed
if
the
prosecutor
write
a
letter
over
to
him
and
say
this
case
is
coming
up
and
if
you
could
come
over
then
we
welcome?
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
he
had
agreed
to
come
and
pay
his
own
expenses?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
may
i
assume
that
the
lawyer
would
have
additional
questions?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
point
is
not
on
his
testimony,
my
point
is
on
cross-examination?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
i
don't
think
you
can
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
determine
what
a
lawyer
would
say
cross-examining
the
witness?
justice
thurgood
marshall
have
you
ever
known
every
question
you
would
ask
on
cross-examination
before
it
started?
justice
thurgood
marshall
thank
you.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
sometimes
the
petitioner
asked
the
court
--
asked
the
prosecutor
to
produce
the
witness?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
i
don't
--
may
be
i
misunderstood,
but
i
understood
your
record
you
showed,
that
they
didn't
want
the
trial
to
go
on
without
the
witness,
but
they
--
whether
a
particular
the
witness
came
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah,
well
couldn’t
it
be
that
what
they
wanted
was
the
trial
not
to
go
on
without
the
witness?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
means
no
trial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
don't
you
think
they
should
have
asked
what
was
going
to
be
done
about
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
don't
you
think
that
they
could
have
raised
that
point
and
told
the
court
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
his
testimony,
that
he
was
on
his
way
from
the
texas
penitentiary?
if
he
was
on
his
way
from
the
texas
penitentiary,
he
was
either
god
or
a
prisoner,
didn't
he
testify
that?
