chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
in
number
71-237,
mancusi
against
stubbs.
mrs.
marcus,
we'll
pause
for
a
moment
until
mr.
carpenter
gets
settled.
mrs.
marcus.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
long
did
he
serve
in
--
on
the
first
sentence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
subject
of
possible
friendship
was
at
least
hinted
at
in
the
first
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
the
defense
ask
for
an
allowance
to
bring
mr.
holm
from
sweden?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mrs.
marcus.
mr.
carpenter.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
didn't
he
also
say
right
at
that
point
that
he
put
the
gun
down
on
the
seat
of
the
car?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
was
--
so
that
the
police
officers
and
others
wouldn't
see
the
gun?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
didn't
throw
the
gun
away
though
anytime
or
offered
to
give
it
to
the
holms?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
this
subject
of
the
alleged
friendly
relation,
a
happy
relationship
that
developed
was
explored
at
the
first
trial,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yeah,
but
it
was
explored
though?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
they
cross
--
mr.
holm
was
examined
on
the
same
subject
and
he
said
there
were
no
friendly
relations
at
all.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
three
days,
couldn't
three
lawyers
have
found
that
out,
if
that
were
invalid
notion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
may
be
it
didn't
occur
to
the
defendant
until
he
got
on
the
stand?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
don't
you
think
they
perhaps
had
an
obligation
to
do
that
before
trial
so
as
not
to
have
the
second
trial
aborted
by
a
mistrial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
assuming
something
on
which
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
on
one
way
or
the
other?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
said
if
they
had
known.
we
don't
know
from
this
record
whether
they
did
or
did
not
know.
for
all
we
know,
they
may
have
been
very
carefully
making
it
a
point
not
to
make
a
demand.
it's
just
as
good
speculation
as
yours
that
they
avoided
making
a
demand
because
they
never
wanted
to
see
mr.
holm
in
the
courtroom?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
wouldn't.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
after
the
trial
was
once
underway
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
only
solution
would
have
been
a
mistrial,
if
they
were
going
to
--
probably
a
mistrial,
if
they
were
going
to
wait
for
this
man
to
be
subpoenaed,
and
determine
whether
he
would
honor
extraterritorial
subpoena
all
the
way
to
sweden.
and
then,
if
a
mistrial
occurred,
i
suppose
it
would
be
open
to
the
defense
to
claim
that
the
mistrial
was
the
fault
of
the
prosecution
and
that
he
could
therefore
raise
the
double
jeopardy
defense.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
yet,
the
military
authority
could
have
ordered
that
man
back
into
the
united
states,
couldn't
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
it
appeared
hypothetically
now,
that's
not
this
case,
but
suppose
hypothetically
it
appeared
that
a
defense
counsel
in
that
posture
consulted
with
his
client
and
said
you
will
be
much
better
off
to
have
this
testimony
read
from
the
transcript
than
to
have
this
man
sitting
in
the
courtroom,
flesh
and
blood
on
the
stand
with
the
scars
of
the
bullet
wounds
on
his
face
and
suppose
he
made
that
decision,
would
you
think
anyone
could
reasonably
say
that
was
ineffective,
that
tactic
was
ineffective
assistance
of
the
counsel
or
was
it
a
permissible
choice?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
didn't
suggest
he
was
dishonest.
i
am
simply
suggesting
that
it
might
have
been
sounder
defense
tactics
not
to
have
mr.
holm
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
you
have
few
minutes
left
