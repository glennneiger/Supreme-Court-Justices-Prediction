so
what
difference
would
it
have
made
if
he
was
a
guest,
how
would
that
have
helped
the
defendant?
justice
byron

white
but
if
he
had
been
a
guest
then
it
could
have
been
felony
murder?
justice
byron

white
how
would
have
that
helped
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
didn't
think
it
was
first
degree
murder?
justice
byron

when
holm
came
back
on
the
stand
on
rebuttal
(inaudible)
after
the
defendant’s
testimony,
that
he
was
available
then
for
cross
examination?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
critical
to
your
case
whether
or
not
representation
was
effective
or
ineffective?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
there
was
no
question
whatsoever
as
to
the
effectiveness
of
counsel
at
the
first
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
saying
that
just
as
though
holm
was
living
ten
miles
away
and
they
thought
it
would
be
more
convenient
to
use
his
prior
testimony
than
call
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
another
conviction
besides
the
tennessee
conviction?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
–
in
texas
(inaudible)
and
new
york
specifically
relied
on
the
tennessee?
justice
byron

white
yes.
justice
byron

white
but
they
have
gone
through
the

mileage
out
of
the
defense's
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
was
that
offered
--
was
the
texas
conviction
offered,
how
did
they
prove
a
prior
conviction
in
new
york?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
that
went
forward
here?
justice
byron

but
how
does
anybody
--
how
did
anybody
know
that
was
in
texas?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
they
are
not
going
through
the
same
proceeding
based
on
the
texas?
justice

so
it
could
be
that
--
justice
byron

--
this
whole
thing,
as
you
say
may
will
be
moot?
justice
byron

yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
so
there
is
currently
another
