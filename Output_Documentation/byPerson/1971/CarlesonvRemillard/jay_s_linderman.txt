mr.
jay
s.
linderman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
the
question
of
whether
the
social
security
act
requires
california
to
grant
welfare
benefits
to
children
whose
fathers
are
out
of
the
home
on
active
duty
in
the
military
service.
specifically,
the
question
is
whether
under
title
iv
of
the
social
security
act,
the
aid
to
families
with
dependant
children
program,
a
military
orphan
who
is
otherwise
needy,
in
other
words,
the
income
standards
of
the
family
are
sufficiently
well
that
they
qualify
under
the
state
standard,
need
standard,
whether
that
child
is
“dependent
child”
under
section
406
(a)
of
the
federal
act.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
the
entire
group
of
military
orphans,
your
honor?
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
servicemen
children?
the
entire
group
is
excluded,
as
are
the
children
of
a
father
who
is
employed,
away
from
home
in
a
civilian
capacity.
in
other
words,
the
exclusion
under
the
california
statute
or
regulation
is
that
if
there
is
a
breadwinner
in
the
family
but
out
of
the
home,
the
child,
be
it
a
military
or
civilian
employment
situation,
the
child
is
ineligible.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
the
assumption,
your
honor,
is
that
the
child
is
needy
where
he
maybe
sending
some
money
home,
but
it's
inadequate
in
terms
of
the
need
standards
under
california
law.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
is
your
honor's
question
the
administrative
burden?
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
i
am
not
certain
that
i
can
answer
it.
i
assume
it
would
be
relatively
difficult
in
that
presumably
there
would
be
a
fluctuating
amount
of
income.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
there
is,
but
then
the
question
is
that
the
state
would
have
to
ascertain
on
a
month-by-month
basis
that
in
fact
that
amount
did
get
there,
so
that
i
believe
the
answer
to
your
honor's
question
in
terms
of
the
administrative
effort
is
that
it
would
have
to
be
an
ongoing
month-to-month
determination
or
verification
of
the
precise
amount
that
did
actually
end
up
in
the
hands
of
the
family.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
that's
correct.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
the
distinction
i
believe,
your
honor,
is
that
california
concedes
in
the
instances
that
you
have
mentioned
that
the
federal
law
requires
the
granting
of
assistance.
we
view
or
acknowledge
that
the
situation
of
an
imprisoned
father
or
a
deported
father
or
dissolution
of
the
marriage
and
so
on
that,
that
type
of
child
is
clearly
within
the
scope
and
purpose
of
the
social
security
act.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
that's
the
hew.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
yes.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
no,
hew
merely
requires
as
the
regulation
says
that
the
state
will
find
it
necessary
to
give
consideration
to
these
groups
in
the
process
of
the
stage
to
finding
its
own
eligibility
policy.
this
has
been
the
traditional
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
distinguish,
in
the
sense,
yes
that
you
can
find
one
group
eligible
and
another
group
ineligible.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
no
that's
not
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
in
the
categories
of,
say,
desertion
or
imprisonment
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
--
as
a
group,
the
children
are
eligible
provided
that
they
then
meet
the
need
standard
as
well.
in
other
words,
as
a
group,
california
determines
the
child
of
an
imprisoned
father
to
be
eligible
provided
that
there
is
sufficiently
lower
amount
of
income
which
undoubtedly
there
is
going
to
be
with
the
father
in
prison,
but
as
california
makes
group
determinations
of
eligibility
both
with
respect
to,
yes,
they
are
eligible.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
yes
your
honor,
we
submit
that
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
--
the
court
is
wrong.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
and
as
specifically
so
said
in
our
brief,
we
do
challenge
that,
that
that
is
a
misstatement
of
what
california
does
do.
i
think
the
question
here
though
is
not
whether
california
administratively
could
do
this
or
whether
in
terms
of
social
policy
they
should
do
it,
the
question
is,
has
congress
compelled
california
to
do
it
or
not
and
our
position
is
that
it
has
not.
congress
has
defined
the
group
of
eligible
children
to
be
those
that
lack
the
support
of
a
parent
due
to
death,
incapacity
or
continued
absence.
this
case
specifically
is
the
question
what
does
congress
mean
by
continued
absence.
at
the
time
that
the
case
was
argued
below,
all
we
had
was
the
hew
regulation
that
mr.
justice
brennan
has
just
referred
to
that
left
it
to
the
state
to
determine
what
continued
absence
met
within
the
scope
of
hew's
interpretation
which
was
a
substantial
severance,
economic
and
socially,
within
the
family.
and
cited
as
their
example,
hew
cited
as
the
example,
the
situation
where
the
father
simply
deserts
the
family
and
disappears.
the
mother
knows
not
where
he
is
or
when
he
will
be
home
or
if
he
will
be
home.
a
complete
destruction
of
the
sociological
and
economic
ties
between
the
father
and
the
child,
that's
the
example
that
hew
gives.
we
submit
nothing
more
than
that
in
the
act
itself
and
thus
given
the
35
years
that
hew
has
had
this
policy
and
the
fact
that
over
the
years,
the
states
have
exercised
the
option
with
congress
doing
nothing
to
disapprove
this,
and
with
the
result
that
there
is
a
roughly
50/50
split
between
the
states
in
terms
of
which
ones
do
and
which
ones
do
not
grant
aid
that
we
think
that
the
states
should
be
continued
the
option
of
defining
their
own
eligibility
policies.
the
question,
of
course,
then
arises
of
what
impact
on
this
past
pattern
does
the
court's
recent
decision
in
townsend
case
have
on
this
case.
townsend,
of
course,
is
the
illinois
afdc
case
in
which
the
state
of
illinois
had
defined
an
eligible
student
to
be
one
who
was
enrolled
only
in
a
vocational
school,
excluding
those
that
were
enrolled
in
academic
institutions;
colleges,
universities
non-vocational.
the
court
in
townsend
held
--
found
that
congress
had
explicitly
defined
what
it
meant
by
a
student.
the
federal
act
itself
specifically
said
that
a
student
was
any
child
up
to
the
age
of
21,
enrolled
in
any
educational
institution
and
furthermore
that
congress
had
made
clear
that
it
intended
that
the
states
must
grant
assistance
to
all
types
of
students.
therefore,
the
court
held
that
illinois
obviously
could
not
define
student
in
a
fashion
that
directly
conflicted
with
the
definition
provided
by
congress.
i
would
submit
that
on
its
facts,
townsend
is
completely
distinguishable
from
this
case,
in
that
there
is
neither
the
precise
congressional
definition
of
continued
absence,
nor
is
there
any
indication,
legislative
history-wise
or
otherwise,
that
congress
intended
that
the
states
have
to
grant
assistance
in
all
types
of
continued
absence
or
that
there
had
to
be
a
nationally
uniform
definition
to
the
term.
assuming
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
we
have
misread
the
townsend
case
and
that
it
does
mean
in
the
court's
view
that
there
must
be
a
nationally
uniform
standards
for
all
aspects
of
the
afdc
program
and
that
congress
or
hew,
presumably
hew,
must
give
content
to
the
vague
term
used
by
congress,
we
would
submit
then
that
the
definition
should
be
held
to
be
of
ineligibility
for
serviceman
standards
for
the
following
reasons.
in
the
case
of
king
versus
smith,
this
court
traced
the
legislative
history
and
outlined,
delimited
the
contours
of
the
afdc
program
as
the
court
perceived
it,
which
was
that
congress
was
not
intending
to
aid
all
needy
children,
but
rather
that
it
was
endeavoring
to
provide
financial
assistance
to
states
for
the
purpose
of
aiding
children
who
lacked
a
breadwinner.
i
think
a
reading
of
the
king
case
makes
clear
that
it's
a
lack
of
a
breadwinner
and
not
merely
a
wage
earner
who
can't
bring
home
enough
bread.
in
other
words
that
afdc
is
not
designed
to
be
a
subsidy
for
low
paying
employers
be
it
the
united
states
government
or
otherwise.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
unless
that
particular
father
--
i
am
assuming
full
employment
in
terms
of
number
of
hours,
he
is
fully
employed.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
and
is
living
in
the
home
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
i
do
not
believe
that
that
family
would
be
eligible.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
under
the
federal
statute
because
he
is
an
employed
breadwinner
living
in
the
home.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
incapacitated.
but
again
then
he
has
to
be
out
of
–
no,
they
they
might
qualify
under
that
provision.
i
am
not
completely
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
i
am
not
--
to
be
utterly
honest,
i
am
not
completely
clear
whether
in
that
instance,
there
would
be
eligibility
or
not.
but
i
think
then
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
i
suppose
conceive
--
i
am
assuming
now
that
you
are
talking
not
in
terms
that
california
makes
decision
on
its
own,
but
that
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
i
suppose
that
it's
conceivable
that
there
is,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
think
the
equal
protection
question
that
the
appellees
in
this
case
purport
to
raise
is
a
completely
different
type
of
situation
from
the
one
that
your
honor
is
hypothesizing.
but
again,
i
believe
that
it's
correct
to
say
that
in
the
example
proposed
that
the
handicapped
father,
in
that
situation
the
child
would
not
be
eligible.
we
would
submit
that
again
referring
to
the
king
case
that
congress
recognized
and
the
court
recognized
in
the
king
case
that
the
problems
posed
by
and
the
solutions
for
unemployment
and
underemployment
are
drastically
different
and
that
afdc
was
designed
to
aid
not
the
underemployed
breadwinner.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
that's
correct,
but
it
subsequently
has
been
expanded
to
include
the
unemployed,
afdc
has
now
been
expanded
to
include
the
unemployed
father
in
the
home,
but
not
the
underemployed.
turning
then
to
the
equal
protection
question
which
the
appellee's
raise
which
again
dovetails
i
believe
with
our
suggestion
or
our
contention
that
if
there
must
be
a
uniform
standard
vis-à-vis
a
servicemen
families
that
it
should
be
ineligibility
that
for
the
same
reason,
it's
not
a
denial
of
equal
protection
to
deny
benefits
to
serviceman's
families
when
at
the
same
time
granting
them
to
families
of,
for
example,
prisoners.
it's
(inaudible)
i
believe
that
the
equal
protection
clause
does
not
require
states
or
federal
government
to
treat
classes
that
are
in
fact
different,
legally
differently.
and
i
would
submit
that
the
situation,
the
economic
situation
and
the
sociological
situation
posed
by
a
serviceman
on
one
hand,
a
prisoner
or
deportee
on
the
other
are
dramatically
different.
first
of
all,
the
imprisoned
father
can
offer
no
economic
security
to
his
family.
the
service
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
mr.
justice
blackmun,
then
i
think
we're
not
talking
about
the
income
generating
capacity
or
the
sociological
impact
in
terms
of
the
intrafamilial
strains
that
imprisonment
would
cause.
but
of
course,
if
he
is
a
millionaire
and
the
money
is
available
to
the
child,
the
child
is
not
going
to
be
eligible,
no
matter
whether
the
father
is
a
millionaire
pfc
or
whether
he
is
a
millionaire
prisoner.
the
child
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
or
whether
he
is
away
from
home,
the
child
is
not
needy
there
which
is
the
second
facet
of
eligibility
which
is
not
present
in
this
case.
we
are
assuming
that
the
child
is
needy
in
this
case
and
the
state
has
conceded
that
the
plaintiffs,
the
appellees
in
the
case,
the
named
plaintiffs
are
needy
and
by
definition,
the
class
represented
by
the
named
plaintiffs
are
those
families
that
are
needy.
so
that
aspect
of
eligibility
is
not
an
issue
in
the
case.
it's
strictly
the
question
of
dependency
or
whether
the
father
is
continuously
absent.
again
then
the
economic
implications
are
different.
the
imprisoned
father
or
deported
father
can
offer
no
economic
security
to
the
child
and
sociologically
we
believe
that
there
is
a
substantial
difference
both
in
terms
of
the
disruptive
influence
in
terms
of
the
family
ties
of
military
service
and
imprisonment
with
a
super
imposition
of
the
social
ostracism
that
goes
with
imprisonment
or
deportation
which
we
think
in
a
normal
situation
anyway
is
totally
lacking
in
the
case
of
military
service.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
we
view
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
as
supporting
these
contentions
and
furthermore
this
court's
tracing
and
delimiting
of
the
act's
scope
in
king
versus
smith
as
erecting
these
kind
of
limits
around
the
program.
as
i
read
king,
the
suggestion
is
there
that
congress
was
concerned
in
the
afdc
program
with
a
limited
class
of
children
and
the
court
says
in
king
specifically
that
the
act
is
not
designed
to
aid
all
needy
children,
but
the
class
is
only
those
that
lack
the
breadwinner.
and
the
court
talks
in
king
about
the
lack
of
the
likelihood
of
any
economic
security
enduring
to
the
child
in
the
king
case
from
the
mother's
paramour
who
owe
the
child
no
duty
and
support.
it's
from
that
that
i
draw
the
economic
aspect
that
there
is
a
lack
of
likelihood
of
economic
protection
for
the
child
from
the
father
and
that
that
mashed
with
the
economic
problem
is
the
social
impact,
the
destruction
of
the
family
ties
through
death,
divorce,
continued
absence
from
the
home.
but
that
analogizing
the
continued
absence
facet
of
eligibility
to
the
other
facets;
death
and
incapacity,
desertion
and
so
on,
i
think
it's
from
that,
that
i
withdraw
the
sociological
or
intrafamilial
association
that
i
am
referring
to.
i
don't
think
it's
of
my
imagination,
but
i
think
that
it's
clearly
as
congress
has
limited
the
program.
now
the
district
court
adverts
briefly
to
the
possibility
that
my
characterization
of
a
less
severe
dislocation
occurring
in
the
service
situation
as
opposed
to
imprisonment
is
perhaps
overstated.
well,
it
may
very
well
be
that
in
certain
service
situation,
service
connected
absences,
that
there
is
indeed
a
severe
dislocation.
assuming
that
nothing
else
happens
though
in
terms
of
a
breakup
of
the
marriage,
the
fact
that
in
certain
military
situations,
there
may
be
severe
dislocation,
does
not
mean
that
there
is
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
as
the
court
has
pointed
out
on
numerous
occasions
that
clause
does
not
require
absolute
mathematical
precision
in
drawing
the
classes
and
sovereign
equity
is
more
right.
but
furthermore,
if
in
the
situation
of
the
service
connected
absence,
other
factors
of
dislocative
significance,
that
is
a
divorce
occurs
as
the
result
of
the
father
being
drafted,
the
child
will
then
become
eligible.
it's
--
california's
position
is
that
military
absence
by
itself
is
insufficient,
but
if
the
other
factors
such
as
a
divorce,
a
breakup
of
the
marriage
occurs,
then
the
family
would
be
in
the
situation
which
we
believe
congress
intended
to
cover
by
afdc.
but
in
the
normal
situation
where
the
only
thing
that
exists
to
arguably
give
rise
to
eligibility
is
the
father's
absence
by
reason
of
his
employment,
be
it
military
or
civilian,
then
california
does
not
grant
assistance
and
we
do
not
believe
that
either
the
social
security
act
or
the
fourteenth
amendment
requires
that
result.
i
have
a
few
moments
left.
so
i'd
like
to
reserve
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
may
i
just
refer
briefly
to
the
townsend
decision
to
respond
to
what
ms.
massey
says
that
the
decision
holds
and
i
don't
mean
to
be
presumptuous
in
telling
the
court
what
it
held
in
that
case.
but
i
believe
that
it's
difficult
to
read
the
decision
as
having
any
applicability
here
in
that
in
townsend,
congress
had
very
clearly
defined
what
a
student
was
in
terms
of
who
as
a
student
was
going
to
be
eligible.
the
court
then
said
that
congress
having
squarely
made
the
person
eligible,
the
state
can't
say
that
the
person
is
ineligible
and
it's
only
in
that
context
i
believe
that
the
court
struck
down
hew's
condition
acts.
and
condition
acts
is
merely
the
deference
--
the
deferential
policy
of
hew,
in
this
case
and
in
any
other
case
of
allowing
states
to
define
eligibility
for
that
state's
program.
now,
i
don't
believe
that
the
court
in
townsend
struck
down
condition
acts
in
all
instances.
now,
that's
my
point
that
in
this
case,
the
court
may
want
in
remillard
case,
the
court
may
choose
to
say
that
there
must
be
national
standards
and
in
this
case,
may
disapprove
in
toto
condition
acts,
but
it
did
not
do
so
we
would
submit
in
the
townsend
case.
for
--
one
final
point,
that
the
administration
welfare
bill
h.r.1
which
is
now
pending
and
has
been
for
some
time,
one
of
the
most
highly
touted
aspects
of
that
bill
is
that
it
establishes
nationally
uniform
standards,
one
of
the
things
lacking
in
afdc.
so
i
would
submit
that
clearly
afdc
does
not,
that
the
social
security
act
does
not
require
national
standards,
particularly
in
this
case
where
congress
has
used
the
vague
term,
continued
absence
and
defer
to
hew
for
35
years
in
allowing
the
states
to
set
their
own
definitions.
thank
you.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
the
question
of
whether
the
social
security
act
requires
california
to
grant
welfare
benefits
to
children
whose
fathers
are
out
of
the
home
on
active
duty
in
the
military
service.
specifically,
the
question
is
whether
under
title
iv
of
the
social
security
act,
the
aid
to
families
with
dependant
children
program,
a
military
orphan
who
is
otherwise
needy,
in
other
words,
the
income
standards
of
the
family
are
sufficiently
well
that
they
qualify
under
the
state
standard,
need
standard,
whether
that
child
is
“dependent
child”
under
section
406
(a)
of
the
federal
act.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
the
entire
group
of
military
orphans,
your
honor?
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
servicemen
children?
the
entire
group
is
excluded,
as
are
the
children
of
a
father
who
is
employed,
away
from
home
in
a
civilian
capacity.
in
other
words,
the
exclusion
under
the
california
statute
or
regulation
is
that
if
there
is
a
breadwinner
in
the
family
but
out
of
the
home,
the
child,
be
it
a
military
or
civilian
employment
situation,
the
child
is
ineligible.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
the
assumption,
your
honor,
is
that
the
child
is
needy
where
he
maybe
sending
some
money
home,
but
it's
inadequate
in
terms
of
the
need
standards
under
california
law.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
is
your
honor's
question
the
administrative
burden?
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
i
am
not
certain
that
i
can
answer
it.
i
assume
it
would
be
relatively
difficult
in
that
presumably
there
would
be
a
fluctuating
amount
of
income.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
there
is,
but
then
the
question
is
that
the
state
would
have
to
ascertain
on
a
month-by-month
basis
that
in
fact
that
amount
did
get
there,
so
that
i
believe
the
answer
to
your
honor's
question
in
terms
of
the
administrative
effort
is
that
it
would
have
to
be
an
ongoing
month-to-month
determination
or
verification
of
the
precise
amount
that
did
actually
end
up
in
the
hands
of
the
family.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
that's
correct.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
the
distinction
i
believe,
your
honor,
is
that
california
concedes
in
the
instances
that
you
have
mentioned
that
the
federal
law
requires
the
granting
of
assistance.
we
view
or
acknowledge
that
the
situation
of
an
imprisoned
father
or
a
deported
father
or
dissolution
of
the
marriage
and
so
on
that,
that
type
of
child
is
clearly
within
the
scope
and
purpose
of
the
social
security
act.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
that's
the
hew.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
yes.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
no,
hew
merely
requires
as
the
regulation
says
that
the
state
will
find
it
necessary
to
give
consideration
to
these
groups
in
the
process
of
the
stage
to
finding
its
own
eligibility
policy.
this
has
been
the
traditional
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
distinguish,
in
the
sense,
yes
that
you
can
find
one
group
eligible
and
another
group
ineligible.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
no
that's
not
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
in
the
categories
of,
say,
desertion
or
imprisonment
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
--
as
a
group,
the
children
are
eligible
provided
that
they
then
meet
the
need
standard
as
well.
in
other
words,
as
a
group,
california
determines
the
child
of
an
imprisoned
father
to
be
eligible
provided
that
there
is
sufficiently
lower
amount
of
income
which
undoubtedly
there
is
going
to
be
with
the
father
in
prison,
but
as
california
makes
group
determinations
of
eligibility
both
with
respect
to,
yes,
they
are
eligible.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
yes
your
honor,
we
submit
that
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
--
the
court
is
wrong.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
and
as
specifically
so
said
in
our
brief,
we
do
challenge
that,
that
that
is
a
misstatement
of
what
california
does
do.
i
think
the
question
here
though
is
not
whether
california
administratively
could
do
this
or
whether
in
terms
of
social
policy
they
should
do
it,
the
question
is,
has
congress
compelled
california
to
do
it
or
not
and
our
position
is
that
it
has
not.
congress
has
defined
the
group
of
eligible
children
to
be
those
that
lack
the
support
of
a
parent
due
to
death,
incapacity
or
continued
absence.
this
case
specifically
is
the
question
what
does
congress
mean
by
continued
absence.
at
the
time
that
the
case
was
argued
below,
all
we
had
was
the
hew
regulation
that
mr.
justice
brennan
has
just
referred
to
that
left
it
to
the
state
to
determine
what
continued
absence
met
within
the
scope
of
hew's
interpretation
which
was
a
substantial
severance,
economic
and
socially,
within
the
family.
and
cited
as
their
example,
hew
cited
as
the
example,
the
situation
where
the
father
simply
deserts
the
family
and
disappears.
the
mother
knows
not
where
he
is
or
when
he
will
be
home
or
if
he
will
be
home.
a
complete
destruction
of
the
sociological
and
economic
ties
between
the
father
and
the
child,
that's
the
example
that
hew
gives.
we
submit
nothing
more
than
that
in
the
act
itself
and
thus
given
the
35
years
that
hew
has
had
this
policy
and
the
fact
that
over
the
years,
the
states
have
exercised
the
option
with
congress
doing
nothing
to
disapprove
this,
and
with
the
result
that
there
is
a
roughly
50/50
split
between
the
states
in
terms
of
which
ones
do
and
which
ones
do
not
grant
aid
that
we
think
that
the
states
should
be
continued
the
option
of
defining
their
own
eligibility
policies.
the
question,
of
course,
then
arises
of
what
impact
on
this
past
pattern
does
the
court's
recent
decision
in
townsend
case
have
on
this
case.
townsend,
of
course,
is
the
illinois
afdc
case
in
which
the
state
of
illinois
had
defined
an
eligible
student
to
be
one
who
was
enrolled
only
in
a
vocational
school,
excluding
those
that
were
enrolled
in
academic
institutions;
colleges,
universities
non-vocational.
the
court
in
townsend
held
--
found
that
congress
had
explicitly
defined
what
it
meant
by
a
student.
the
federal
act
itself
specifically
said
that
a
student
was
any
child
up
to
the
age
of
21,
enrolled
in
any
educational
institution
and
furthermore
that
congress
had
made
clear
that
it
intended
that
the
states
must
grant
assistance
to
all
types
of
students.
therefore,
the
court
held
that
illinois
obviously
could
not
define
student
in
a
fashion
that
directly
conflicted
with
the
definition
provided
by
congress.
i
would
submit
that
on
its
facts,
townsend
is
completely
distinguishable
from
this
case,
in
that
there
is
neither
the
precise
congressional
definition
of
continued
absence,
nor
is
there
any
indication,
legislative
history-wise
or
otherwise,
that
congress
intended
that
the
states
have
to
grant
assistance
in
all
types
of
continued
absence
or
that
there
had
to
be
a
nationally
uniform
definition
to
the
term.
assuming
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
we
have
misread
the
townsend
case
and
that
it
does
mean
in
the
court's
view
that
there
must
be
a
nationally
uniform
standards
for
all
aspects
of
the
afdc
program
and
that
congress
or
hew,
presumably
hew,
must
give
content
to
the
vague
term
used
by
congress,
we
would
submit
then
that
the
definition
should
be
held
to
be
of
ineligibility
for
serviceman
standards
for
the
following
reasons.
in
the
case
of
king
versus
smith,
this
court
traced
the
legislative
history
and
outlined,
delimited
the
contours
of
the
afdc
program
as
the
court
perceived
it,
which
was
that
congress
was
not
intending
to
aid
all
needy
children,
but
rather
that
it
was
endeavoring
to
provide
financial
assistance
to
states
for
the
purpose
of
aiding
children
who
lacked
a
breadwinner.
i
think
a
reading
of
the
king
case
makes
clear
that
it's
a
lack
of
a
breadwinner
and
not
merely
a
wage
earner
who
can't
bring
home
enough
bread.
in
other
words
that
afdc
is
not
designed
to
be
a
subsidy
for
low
paying
employers
be
it
the
united
states
government
or
otherwise.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
unless
that
particular
father
--
i
am
assuming
full
employment
in
terms
of
number
of
hours,
he
is
fully
employed.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
and
is
living
in
the
home
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
i
do
not
believe
that
that
family
would
be
eligible.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
under
the
federal
statute
because
he
is
an
employed
breadwinner
living
in
the
home.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
incapacitated.
but
again
then
he
has
to
be
out
of
–
no,
they
they
might
qualify
under
that
provision.
i
am
not
completely
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
i
am
not
--
to
be
utterly
honest,
i
am
not
completely
clear
whether
in
that
instance,
there
would
be
eligibility
or
not.
but
i
think
then
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
i
suppose
conceive
--
i
am
assuming
now
that
you
are
talking
not
in
terms
that
california
makes
decision
on
its
own,
but
that
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
i
suppose
that
it's
conceivable
that
there
is,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
think
the
equal
protection
question
that
the
appellees
in
this
case
purport
to
raise
is
a
completely
different
type
of
situation
from
the
one
that
your
honor
is
hypothesizing.
but
again,
i
believe
that
it's
correct
to
say
that
in
the
example
proposed
that
the
handicapped
father,
in
that
situation
the
child
would
not
be
eligible.
we
would
submit
that
again
referring
to
the
king
case
that
congress
recognized
and
the
court
recognized
in
the
king
case
that
the
problems
posed
by
and
the
solutions
for
unemployment
and
underemployment
are
drastically
different
and
that
afdc
was
designed
to
aid
not
the
underemployed
breadwinner.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
that's
correct,
but
it
subsequently
has
been
expanded
to
include
the
unemployed,
afdc
has
now
been
expanded
to
include
the
unemployed
father
in
the
home,
but
not
the
underemployed.
turning
then
to
the
equal
protection
question
which
the
appellee's
raise
which
again
dovetails
i
believe
with
our
suggestion
or
our
contention
that
if
there
must
be
a
uniform
standard
vis-à-vis
a
servicemen
families
that
it
should
be
ineligibility
that
for
the
same
reason,
it's
not
a
denial
of
equal
protection
to
deny
benefits
to
serviceman's
families
when
at
the
same
time
granting
them
to
families
of,
for
example,
prisoners.
it's
(inaudible)
i
believe
that
the
equal
protection
clause
does
not
require
states
or
federal
government
to
treat
classes
that
are
in
fact
different,
legally
differently.
and
i
would
submit
that
the
situation,
the
economic
situation
and
the
sociological
situation
posed
by
a
serviceman
on
one
hand,
a
prisoner
or
deportee
on
the
other
are
dramatically
different.
first
of
all,
the
imprisoned
father
can
offer
no
economic
security
to
his
family.
the
service
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
mr.
justice
blackmun,
then
i
think
we're
not
talking
about
the
income
generating
capacity
or
the
sociological
impact
in
terms
of
the
intrafamilial
strains
that
imprisonment
would
cause.
but
of
course,
if
he
is
a
millionaire
and
the
money
is
available
to
the
child,
the
child
is
not
going
to
be
eligible,
no
matter
whether
the
father
is
a
millionaire
pfc
or
whether
he
is
a
millionaire
prisoner.
the
child
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
or
whether
he
is
away
from
home,
the
child
is
not
needy
there
which
is
the
second
facet
of
eligibility
which
is
not
present
in
this
case.
we
are
assuming
that
the
child
is
needy
in
this
case
and
the
state
has
conceded
that
the
plaintiffs,
the
appellees
in
the
case,
the
named
plaintiffs
are
needy
and
by
definition,
the
class
represented
by
the
named
plaintiffs
are
those
families
that
are
needy.
so
that
aspect
of
eligibility
is
not
an
issue
in
the
case.
it's
strictly
the
question
of
dependency
or
whether
the
father
is
continuously
absent.
again
then
the
economic
implications
are
different.
the
imprisoned
father
or
deported
father
can
offer
no
economic
security
to
the
child
and
sociologically
we
believe
that
there
is
a
substantial
difference
both
in
terms
of
the
disruptive
influence
in
terms
of
the
family
ties
of
military
service
and
imprisonment
with
a
super
imposition
of
the
social
ostracism
that
goes
with
imprisonment
or
deportation
which
we
think
in
a
normal
situation
anyway
is
totally
lacking
in
the
case
of
military
service.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
we
view
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
as
supporting
these
contentions
and
furthermore
this
court's
tracing
and
delimiting
of
the
act's
scope
in
king
versus
smith
as
erecting
these
kind
of
limits
around
the
program.
as
i
read
king,
the
suggestion
is
there
that
congress
was
concerned
in
the
afdc
program
with
a
limited
class
of
children
and
the
court
says
in
king
specifically
that
the
act
is
not
designed
to
aid
all
needy
children,
but
the
class
is
only
those
that
lack
the
breadwinner.
and
the
court
talks
in
king
about
the
lack
of
the
likelihood
of
any
economic
security
enduring
to
the
child
in
the
king
case
from
the
mother's
paramour
who
owe
the
child
no
duty
and
support.
it's
from
that
that
i
draw
the
economic
aspect
that
there
is
a
lack
of
likelihood
of
economic
protection
for
the
child
from
the
father
and
that
that
mashed
with
the
economic
problem
is
the
social
impact,
the
destruction
of
the
family
ties
through
death,
divorce,
continued
absence
from
the
home.
but
that
analogizing
the
continued
absence
facet
of
eligibility
to
the
other
facets;
death
and
incapacity,
desertion
and
so
on,
i
think
it's
from
that,
that
i
withdraw
the
sociological
or
intrafamilial
association
that
i
am
referring
to.
i
don't
think
it's
of
my
imagination,
but
i
think
that
it's
clearly
as
congress
has
limited
the
program.
now
the
district
court
adverts
briefly
to
the
possibility
that
my
characterization
of
a
less
severe
dislocation
occurring
in
the
service
situation
as
opposed
to
imprisonment
is
perhaps
overstated.
well,
it
may
very
well
be
that
in
certain
service
situation,
service
connected
absences,
that
there
is
indeed
a
severe
dislocation.
assuming
that
nothing
else
happens
though
in
terms
of
a
breakup
of
the
marriage,
the
fact
that
in
certain
military
situations,
there
may
be
severe
dislocation,
does
not
mean
that
there
is
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
as
the
court
has
pointed
out
on
numerous
occasions
that
clause
does
not
require
absolute
mathematical
precision
in
drawing
the
classes
and
sovereign
equity
is
more
right.
but
furthermore,
if
in
the
situation
of
the
service
connected
absence,
other
factors
of
dislocative
significance,
that
is
a
divorce
occurs
as
the
result
of
the
father
being
drafted,
the
child
will
then
become
eligible.
it's
--
california's
position
is
that
military
absence
by
itself
is
insufficient,
but
if
the
other
factors
such
as
a
divorce,
a
breakup
of
the
marriage
occurs,
then
the
family
would
be
in
the
situation
which
we
believe
congress
intended
to
cover
by
afdc.
but
in
the
normal
situation
where
the
only
thing
that
exists
to
arguably
give
rise
to
eligibility
is
the
father's
absence
by
reason
of
his
employment,
be
it
military
or
civilian,
then
california
does
not
grant
assistance
and
we
do
not
believe
that
either
the
social
security
act
or
the
fourteenth
amendment
requires
that
result.
i
have
a
few
moments
left.
so
i'd
like
to
reserve
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
may
i
just
refer
briefly
to
the
townsend
decision
to
respond
to
what
ms.
massey
says
that
the
decision
holds
and
i
don't
mean
to
be
presumptuous
in
telling
the
court
what
it
held
in
that
case.
but
i
believe
that
it's
difficult
to
read
the
decision
as
having
any
applicability
here
in
that
in
townsend,
congress
had
very
clearly
defined
what
a
student
was
in
terms
of
who
as
a
student
was
going
to
be
eligible.
the
court
then
said
that
congress
having
squarely
made
the
person
eligible,
the
state
can't
say
that
the
person
is
ineligible
and
it's
only
in
that
context
i
believe
that
the
court
struck
down
hew's
condition
acts.
and
condition
acts
is
merely
the
deference
--
the
deferential
policy
of
hew,
in
this
case
and
in
any
other
case
of
allowing
states
to
define
eligibility
for
that
state's
program.
now,
i
don't
believe
that
the
court
in
townsend
struck
down
condition
acts
in
all
instances.
now,
that's
my
point
that
in
this
case,
the
court
may
want
in
remillard
case,
the
court
may
choose
to
say
that
there
must
be
national
standards
and
in
this
case,
may
disapprove
in
toto
condition
acts,
but
it
did
not
do
so
we
would
submit
in
the
townsend
case.
for
--
one
final
point,
that
the
administration
welfare
bill
h.r.1
which
is
now
pending
and
has
been
for
some
time,
one
of
the
most
highly
touted
aspects
of
that
bill
is
that
it
establishes
nationally
uniform
standards,
one
of
the
things
lacking
in
afdc.
so
i
would
submit
that
clearly
afdc
does
not,
that
the
social
security
act
does
not
require
national
standards,
particularly
in
this
case
where
congress
has
used
the
vague
term,
continued
absence
and
defer
to
hew
for
35
years
in
allowing
the
states
to
set
their
own
definitions.
thank
you.
