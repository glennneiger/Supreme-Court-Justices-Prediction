where
one

now
that

have
interrupted

there
anything
in

he
may
do
that,

that
it?
justice

justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
understand
mr.
massey
to
say
that
california
treats
fathers
who
are
absent
from
home
either
because
they
are
employed
away
from
the
home
or
are
seeking
employment
away
from
the
home,
just
as
does
military
personnel,
that
it
excludes
them
as
a
group.
did
i
misunderstand
that?
justice
potter
stewart
but
at
least
that
group
of
fathers
employed
in
a
civilian
capacity
of
one
kind
another
away
from
the
home,
or
who
are
seeking
employment,
civilian
employment,
non-military
employment
away
from
the
home
are
excluded
as
a
group
from
parents
absent,
continually
absent
from
home,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
just
as
military
--
justice

nor
from
a

is
