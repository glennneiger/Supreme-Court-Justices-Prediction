warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
70-250,
carleson
against
remillard.
mr.
linderman,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now.
let
me
ask
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
would
it
be
difficult,
would
it
be
impossible
or
very
difficult
for
california
to
determine
how
much
of
an
allotment
of
a
drafted
man
in
confinement
to
that,
a
drafted
man
in
the
service,
how
much
he
is
sending
home
on
the
allotment
and
then
at
least
gives
the
benefits
to
the
extent
of
the
difference.
would
that
be
administratively
a
difficult
thing
to
do?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
not
if
he
is
a
lower
class
that
is
in
the
first
few
grades,
there
is
a
fixed
allotment
sent
home?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let
me
ask
you
on
that
score.
suppose
the
ostensible
breadwinner,
the
father,
was
handicapped
and
worked
at
the
goodwill
and
because
of
his
handicap,
could
make
only
$118
a
month,
would
that
automatically
make
them
an
ineligible
for
aid
to
dependent
families
and
children?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
but
he
is
blind
or
whatever,
some
disabilities
of
it
--
and
let's
not
make
it
blind
because
then
he
would
be
getting
some
income
under
social
security,
but
he
has
got
some
handicapped,
maybe
just
basic
intelligence,
but
he
works
at
his
full
capacity
and
makes
this
nominal
amount.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
is
trying
to
win
the
bread
for
the
family.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
the
federal
statute
or
the
regulations
of
california?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
assuming
for
the
moment
that
there
would
be
eligibility
and
this
$118
a
month
does
not
bar
an
eligibility.
now
then
a
private
first
class
of
lowest
grade,
married
with
dependents
is
permitted,
i
understand
as
a
matter
of
regulation,
perhaps
a
statute,
$118
a
month
allotment
for
his
family.
could
you
conceivably
have
an
arguable
equal
protection
argument
if
the
man
at
home
earning
a
$118
was
treated
in
a
different
way
from
the
drafted
solider
earning
enough
so
that
there
was
$118
a
month
allotment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
i
am
just
saying,
is
there
arguably
an
equal
protection
problem
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
now
does
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
of
congress
make
these
distinctions
you're
talking
about
or
are
these
just
advanced
as
your
considerations?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may
reserve
that.
very
well,
miss
massey.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
every
case
when
the
parent
is
absent,
the
constant
factor
is
that
demonstration
of
need,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
no
benefits
could
be
paid
if
the
man
were
employed
at
the
substantial
income,
no
matter
how
long
he
was
absent?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
would
it
be
so
difficult,
i'll
put
the
question
to
you,
i'll
put
to
the
counsel
for
the
state,
to
administratively
determine
what
was
the
difference
between
the
fair
allotment,
the
maximum
allotment
that
could
be
made
and
the
allowance
that
the
state
would
pay?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
you
have
about
three
minutes
left,
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

you,
mr.

miss
