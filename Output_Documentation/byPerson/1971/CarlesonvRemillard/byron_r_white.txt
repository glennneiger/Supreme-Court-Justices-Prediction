justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
is
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
he
was
living
at
home
and
he
was
in
the
military
and
he
was
not
making
enough
to
satisfy
the
standard
needs?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
would
be
just
as
irrational,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
that,
but
you
are
also
arguing
about
the
situations
that
you
claim
were
in
comparison
are
irrational.
well
i
--
justice
byron
r.
white
has
there
been
any
congressional,
any
proposals
in
the
congress
to
have
a
statutory
definition
of
continued
absence
that
would
bear
on
this
situation?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
the
past,
there
haven't
been
some
proposals
to
provide
a
national
standard
for
aid
to
military
people
that
have
either
been
adopted,
well
if
they
haven't
been
adopted
obviously
but
there
have
been
rejected,
there
haven't
been
any
proposals
like
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
which
--
under
which
definition,
the
states
can
do
it
either
one
way
or
the
other?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
hew
certainly
doesn't
think
it's
definition
requires
the
states
to
give
aid,
at
least
that's
what
they've
reached
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
he
is
stationed
near
home
and
living
off
the
base,
the
welfare
was
not
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
switched
into
seattle
(inaudible)
even
though
he
was
sending
them
all
the
allotments?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
conclusion
from
that
is
that
the
continued
absence
must
have
one
definition
countrywide?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that
means
--
that
would
mean
that
any
state
plan
that
for
which
congress
provided
matching
funds
would
mean
that
those
children
for
which
the
matching
funds
are
eligible
and
every
other
state
would
have
to
confirm
to
the
state
that
had
the
highest
level
of
eligibility
in
its
plan?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
this
case,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
does
because
here
you
have
to
look
and
find
legislative
history
or
something
in
the
act
to
the
show
that
congress
meant
to
include
military
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
but
if
you
are
wrong
then
that
only
had
to
be
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
hew
certainly
doesn't
think
that
any
of
these
words
in
the
regulation
to
support
your
view?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
if
congress
has
said
specifically
in
the
act,
continued
absence
but
the
states
have
a
discretion
of
whether
or
not
to
include
military
people,
would
you
be
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
constitutional
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
on
the
statutory
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
even
though
on
the
statutory
argument
if
half
of
the
states
covered
military
people
and
half
of
the
states
didn't,
military
people
are
eligible?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
is
the
way
it
is
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
think
that
the
hew's
position
is
by
using
this
general
term
against
the
history,
35-year
history
that
it's
just
as
though
that
congress
had
said
expressly
that
the
states
may
have
discretion
and
thus
even
though
military
children
are
eligible,
it
doesn't
mean
there
is
a
violation
of
the
act
in
those
states
where
they
clearly
they
don't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
your
basic
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
is
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
he
was
living
at

and
he
was
in
