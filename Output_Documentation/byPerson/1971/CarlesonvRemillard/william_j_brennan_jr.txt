justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
linderman,
i
gather
that
under
the
california
practice,
where
the
absence
is
due
to
imprisonment
or
medical
treatment
or
parental
separation,
that
inquiry
is
made
on
an
individual
basis,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
what's
the
distinction
between
those
classifications
and
this
across
the
board
as
applied
to
children
of
fathers
absent
on
military
orders?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
yet
the
guideline,
all
of
these
are
embraced
in
the
same
guideline,
aren't
they,
that's
that
34222?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i
mean.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
one,
within
this
interpretation
of
continued
absence,
the
state
agency
in
developing
its
policy
will
find
it
necessary
to
give
consideration
to
such
situations
as
divorce,
pending
divorce,
desertion
all
the
way
down
the
line,
service
to
the
armed
forces
or
other
military
service
and
makes
no
distinctions
of
a
kind
that
california
draws,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
course,
but
find
it
necessary
to
give
consideration,
may
it
distinguish
in
the
way
it
gives
consideration
under
that
regulation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
the
sounds
what
problem
is.
the
problem
is
that
you
treat
each
case
on
an
individual
basis
in
all
categories,
except
service
in
the
armed
forces?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
not!
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
that
suggest
mr.
linderman
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
wrong
because
i
am
reading
in
cases
of
a
father's
absence
due
to
imprisonment
or
temporary
medical
treatment
or
parental
separation,
california
considers
each
applicant's
situation
individually.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
wrong.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
stop
to
there,
miss
massey.
where
is
it
that
--
thus
statute
expressly
lead
to
the
states
the
definition
of
“continued
absence”
from
the
home?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no.
the
district
court
suggested
that
it
did?
i
just
wondered
what
provision,
they
don't
cite
anything,
they
refer
to
when
they
said
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
isn't
any
doubt
i
gather
that
at
least
the
regulations
suggest
that
states
do
have
discretion
in
the
definition
of
continued
absence
from
home,
is
that
so?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
3422.2,
is
that
condition
'x'?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
--
is
the
one
that
deals
here
with
the
interpretations,
hew
regulation,
the
one
i
was
talking,
is
that
condition
'x'?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh!
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
they
have
also
made
them
to
the
state's
matching
that
don't
pay
those
benefits?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
about
half
of
the
states
deny
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
if
we
affirm
here
those
states
that
are
now
--
not
doing
it,
will
have
to,
won't
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
the
needy
children
of
really
patriotic
soldiers
don't
get
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
this
hew
has
suggested
this
whole
problem
might
perhaps
more
appropriately
be
handled
as
a
responsibility
to
military
pay
and
allotment
system?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
take
it
there
must
be
some
situations
where
even
if
100%
of
the
soldier's
salary
were
remitted
home
under
the
allotment
system,
it
still
wouldn't
be
enough
to
meet
the
family
standard
either?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
linderman
suggested
that
district
court
was
wrong
in
saying
that
there
are
other
classifications
of
absence
from
the
home
that
california
handles
on
an
individual
basis.and
t
here
--
this
is
the
group
basis
but
i
think
he
said
the
children
of
prisoners
are
handled
as
a
group
not
on
individual
case
basis?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
they're
provided
to
some
20-25
states
now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
linderman,
i
gather
that
under
the
california
practice,
where
the
absence
is
due
to
imprisonment
or
medical
treatment
or
parental
separation,
that
inquiry
is
made
on
an
individual
basis,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
what's
the
distinction
between
those
classifications
and
this
across
the
board
as
applied
to
children
of
fathers
absent
on
military
orders?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
yet
the
guideline,
all
of
these
are
embraced
in
the
same
guideline,
aren't
they,
that's
that
34222?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i
mean.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
one,
within
this
interpretation
of
continued
absence,
the
state
agency
in
developing
its

will
find
it
necessary
to
give

makes

does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
course,
but
find
it
necessary
to
give
consideration,
may
it
distinguish
in
the
way
it
gives
consideration
under
that
regulation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
the
sounds
what
problem
is.
the
problem
is
that
you
treat
each
case
on
an
individual
basis
in
all
categories,
except
service
in
the
armed
forces?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
not!
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
that
suggest
mr.
linderman
that

justice
william
j.

that's

justice
william
j.

i

justice
william
j.
brennan,

may
i
stop
to

miss
