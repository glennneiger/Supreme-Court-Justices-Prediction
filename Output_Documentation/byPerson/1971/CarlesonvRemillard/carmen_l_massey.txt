ms.
carmen
l.
massey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issues
that
are
presented
for
this
court
in
this
case
and
the
structures
within
which
they
are
presented
are
straightforward.
the
federal
social
security
act
of
1935
provided
for
the
implementation
of
the
afdc
program.
under
that
statute,
states
which
provide
financial
assistance
to
families,
with
what
are
called
dependent
children,
may
be
provided
federal
matching
funds
--
will
be
provided
federal
matching
funds.
the
federal
social
security
act
further
defines
a
dependent
child
as
one
who
has
been
deprived
of
parental
support
or
care
by
reason
of
the
death
--
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
our
argument
is
that
it
does
not.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
your
honor,
i
think
the
district
court
opinion
is
somewhat
ambiguous
on
that
subject.
however,
in
light
of
the
rest
of
the
opinion,
i
think
what
the
district
court
was
saying
was
that
the
court
or
the
state
must
determined
on
an
individual
basis
as
to
whether
or
not
continued
absence
exists
in
a
particular
case,
including
in
the
military
service
case.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
that
is
correct.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
however,
in
light
of
the
townsend
case
which
expressly
disapproved
hew's,
what
is
it
known
as
a
condition
'x'
--
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
--
i
think
that
is
no
longer
a
proper
interpretation
--
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
pardon
me.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
i
think
it
is
your
honor.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
i
believe
that
it
is
a
part
of
the
condition
'x'
which
was
expressly
disapproved
by
this
court
in
townsend
v.
swank.
the
court
below
found
that
--
california
has
further
defined
the
term
dependent
child
by
providing
that
when
a
needy
child
is
deprived
of
parental
support
or
care
by
reason
of
the
continued
absence
of
a
parent
and
that
absence
is
occasioned
by
his
military
service,
there
is
no
continued
absence
such
as
to
give
rise
to
dependency
and
afdc
eligibility.
the
court
below
found
the
state
regulation
invalid
on
two
grounds.
one
that
the
social
security
act
mandates
that
all
eligible
individuals
be
granted
afdc
benefits
with
reason
proffers,
and
number
two
that
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
in
its
implementing
regulation
mandated
that
the
states
in
developing
their
policy
as
to
what
constitutes
continued
absence
from
the
home
must
take
into
consideration
military
absence.
and
the
court
further
read
this
to
provide
that
the
states
must
consider
each
case
on
its
individual
merits
and
not
on
the
basis
of
the
group
to
which
our
case
belongs.
i
would
add
at
this
point
that
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare
through
the
solicitor
general
has
filed
a
brief
in
this
case,
indicating
that
it
agrees
with
appellant's
argument
that
the
states
are
free
to
define
continued
absence
from
the
home
as
they
choose,
but
indicating
that
it
disagrees
with
appellant's
argument
that
military
orphans
as
we
have
called
them
are
not
federally
eligible
for
afdc
benefits,
and
it
is
the
second
argument
that
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
first.
we
submit
that
when
congress
used
the
words
continued
absence
from
the
home
that
it
meant
exactly
what
the
plain
english
definition
of
those
words
is.
when
congress
said
continued
absence
from
the
home,
it
meant
those
situations
in
which
a
parent
is
not
physically
present
in
the
home
and
this
non-presence
can
be
expected
to
continue
for
a
certain
length
of
time
which
are
called
continued.
i
would
point
out
as
an
example
of
what
continued
absence
means,
the
situation
of
the
remillard
family
in
this
case.
mr.
remillard
was
in
vietnam
for
over
a
year.
during
the
time
he
was
in
vietnam,
he
was
not
allowed
to
return
to
his
family.
his
family
was
not
allowed
to
go
and
visit
him.
by
army
regulation,
the
family
was
not
even
allowed
to
move
to
a
point
where
they
would
be
near
him.
and
certainly
in
this
case,
whatever
continued
absence
might
mean,
it
was
present
here
and
i
would
point
out
that
the
state
has
stipulated
that
there
was
continued
absence
in
this
case.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
and
that
his
family
had
been
free
to
join
him?
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
alright,
if
mr.
remillard
had
been
the
ambassador
and
if
his
family
were
not
free
to
join
him
and
if
by
some
chance
that
family
were
also
needy
that
is
according
to
this
california
definition,
unable
to
provide
the
basic
necessities
of
life,
then
i
would
say,
yes,
that
family
would
be
eligible
for
afdc
benefits.
of
course,
in
the
case
of
the
ambassador
it's
highly
unlikely
that
the
family
would
be
financially
needy.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
for
grades
e1,
e2,
e3,
and
e4,
the
regulations
provide
that
a
serviceman
may
initiate
the
basic
allotment
which
consists
of
the
basic
allowance
for
quarters
which
is
called
to
baq
and
which
is
a
separate
from
the
serviceman's
pay
and
which
also
includes
$40
per
month
which
is
taken
out
of
the
serviceman's
pay.
now
if
the
--
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
well,
the
regulations
provide
that
he
may,
but
they
further
provide
that
if
he
does
not
and
if
the
wife
objects
that
certain
procedures
will
be
followed
to
ensure
that
she
does
receive
her
allotment.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
from
the
same
sources,
the
$105
for
grades
e1,
e2,
and
e3,
slightly
more
for
grade
e4,
which
comes
from
outside
his
pay
and
$40
which
comes
from
in
his
pay.
now
there
is
also
a
provision
in
the
allotment
system
that
the
serviceman
may
voluntarily
add
more
to
this
allotment,
but
we
are
here
considering
with
cases
where
the
amount
of
money
that
is
coming
from
the
serviceman
is
inadequate
to
care
for
the
basic
needs
of
the
family.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
yes.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
and
if
that
money
were
actually
coming
into
that
child,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
interpretation
of
the
term
continued
absence
follows
this
common
sense
approach
as
to
what
the
term
means.
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
in
its
section
3422.2
of
handbook
of
public
assistance
administration,
part
iv
has
defined
continued
absence
from
the
home
as,
(1)
when
the
parent
is
out
of
the
home,
there
is
a
clear
situation
here;
(2)
when
the
nature
of
the
absence
is
such
as
to
either
interrupt
or
terminate
the
parent's
functioning
as
a
provider
of
maintenance,
physical
care,
or
guidance
for
the
child.
and
i
would
point
out
here
that
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
is
concerned
not
only
with
the
fact
that
the
father
is
not
able
to
adequately
support
his
family
financially,
but
with
the
fact
that
the
father
is
not
present
in
the
home
to
provide
the
kind
of
physical
care
and
emotional
nurturance
that
the
child
needs.
hew
has
one
further
consideration,
when
the
known
or
indefinite
duration
of
the
absence
precludes
counting
on
the
parent's
performance
of
his
function
in
planning
for
the
present
support
or
care
of
the
child.
that
is
certainly
also
the
situation
we
have
here.
remillard
was
in
vietnam
for
a
year.
during
that
time
he
was
not
available
to
help
take
care
of
the
child
to
make
plans
concerning
her
future.
the
longstanding
interpretation
of
hew
is
that
military
orphans
are
federally
eligible
for
afdc
benefits.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
are,
yes,
your
honor.
for
at
least
25
years,
federal
matching
payments
have
been
made
to
those
states
which
do
grant
afdc
benefits
to
needy
military
orphans.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
that's
correct,
your
honor,
i
think.
there
are
two
different
issues
here.
the
first
one
is,
are
the
children
federally
eligible
and
the
second
is,
if
the
children
are
federally
eligible
then
may
the
states
deny
them
these
benefits.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
there
are
some
20
off
states
plus
the
district
of
columbia
which
do
grant
benefits
to
all
needy
military
orphans.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
yes,
your
honor.
the
states
also
make
some
further
distinctions.
for
example,
at
the
time
when
filed
this
case,
there
were
two
states
and
there
is
now
one
state
that
gives
afdc
benefits
to
the
needy
children
of
draftees,
but
not
to
the
needy
children
of
enlistees.
there
are
two
further
states
which
grant
afdc
benefits
to
the
needy
children
of
draftees
or
men
who
have
enlisted
in
order
to
avoid
the
draft,
but
not
to
the
needy
children
of
men
who
have
enlisted.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
[attempt
to
laughter]
that's
right.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
your
honor.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
that
is
correct.
i
don't
know
what
the
division
of
states
was
at
that
time.
the
afdc
program
focuses
on
the
child.
this
was
stated
by
this
court
in
the
case
of
king
v.
smith
and
it's
been
reiterated
several
times.
what
is
important
is
the
status
of
a
child,
not
the
legal
status
of
the
parents.
now,
a
regulation
such
as
california
has,
can
lead
to
certain
very
absurd
results
and
as
an
example
of
this,
i
would
point
out
the
situation
of
the
intervener
in
this
case,
joyce
dones.
part
of
the
intervention
of
this
action
joyce
dones
and
her
husband
and
their
two
children
were
living
together.
she
was
also
expecting
a
third
child.
mr.
dones
was
working
full-time
and
supporting
his
family.
mr.
dones
was
then
ordered
to
submit
to
induction
to
the
army
and
he
was
then
sent
to
his
basic
training.
by
army
regulation,
his
family
was
not
allowed
to
join
him
at
the
site
of
the
basic
training.
now,
if
mr.
dones
instead
of
submitting
to
induction,
if
he
had
refused
induction
and
then
subsequently
been
arrested,
convicted
and
sentenced
for
this
unlawful
act,
there
is
no
question
but
that
in
california
his
children
would
have
been
eligible
for
afdc
benefits.
now
as
far
as
the
child
is
concerned,
there
probably
wouldn't
have
been
much
difference.
in
each
case,
the
father
would
have
been
gone
for
certain
length
of
time.
if
he
was
in
jail,
she
would
more
likely
be
able
to
visit
the
father
and
if
he
was
in
jail,
he
probably
didn't
have
as
many
chances
of
being
killed,
but
yet
in
one
case,
the
child
is
eligible
for
afdc
benefits
and
in
the
other
case,
the
child
is
not
eligible.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
except
for
the
fact
that
in
this
case,
need
is
not
in
question.
by
the
standards
developed
by
the
california
department
of
social
welfare
our
class
is
composed
only
of
needy
children,
children
who
aren't
getting
anything
and
i
would
further
point
out
that
in
the
case
of
nancy
remillard,
when
we
first
filed
this
action,
she
wasn't
getting
anything
either.
she
wasn't
getting
any
allotment.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
we
do
not
contend
that
the
family
would
have
been
eligible
for
afdc
benefits
--
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
[attempt
to
laughter]
we
are
dwelling
here
on
the
statutory
argument
--
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
okay,
if
the
father
were
living
at
home,
there
are,
of
course,
certain
economies
of
living
about
maintaining
only
one
household
and
also
the
father
would
be
available
to
help
with
the
physical
care
of
the
children,
he
would
be
available
to
provide
guidance
and
possibly
in
some
situations,
he
would
be
able
to
take
a
second
job.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
yes.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
in
california,
if
a
husband
is
sent
to
jail
and
if
he
is
released
on
the
work
furlough
program,
which
is
a
procedure
whereby
the
husband
goes
to
work
and
then
returns
to
jail
for
the
night
or
for
the
day,
if
he
happens
to
be
working
in
the
night
shift,
even
in
the
case
like
this,
where
the
husband
is
employed,
the
family
will
be
granted
afdc
benefits
based
upon
his
absence
if
the
family
is,
in
fact,
needy
and
i
think
this
is
very
close
to
that
situation.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
no,
your
honor,
i
would
only
point
out
that
congress
is
currently
considering
enhancement,
considering
for
some
time,
the
family
assistance
program
and
one
of
the
provisions
in
that
program
is
that
the
families
who
are
assisted
must
be
intact
families
living
together.
and
--
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
i
don't
know
of
any
proposals
that
deal
specifically
with
the
military
problem.
i
would
note
that
congress
has
simply
acquiesced
in
the
hew
definition
which
does
include
military
orphans.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
well,
we
maintain
there
are
two
parts
to
that
definition.
the
first
part
is
that
they
are
eligible
and
the
second
part
is
what
we
maintain
has
been
--
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
that's
correct,
your
honor.
at
this
point
we
are
only
dealing
with
whether
or
not
they
are
federally
eligible
and
the
second
part
of
the
argument
is
concerned
with
whether
or
not
this
case
is
outside
the
scope
of
townsend
v.
swank.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
your
honor,
we
would
agree
that
the
military
pay
and
allotment
system
could
be
much
more
equitable.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
oh!
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
absolutely
correct
and
there
is
also
the
problem
that
even
if
the
soldiers
pay
were
raised
to
$10,000
a
year,
there
are
always
going
to
occur
situations
like
nancy
remillard
found
herself
in,
she
wasn't
getting
any
money.
somehow
the
allotment
system
had
broken
down
and
she
didn't
have
any
money,
not
even
this
very
low
sum
that
the
military
does
send.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
your
honor,
our
contention
is
that
this
would
be
very
simple
to
administer
and
i
would
compare
it
to
the
situation
where
you
have
parents
who
are
separated
by
agreement.
in
that
kind
of
a
situation,
you
frequently
find
a
father
who
is
absent,
and
who
returns
to
the
home
to
visit
the
children,
to
see
his
wife
for
whatever
reason
and
there
is
a
real
administrative
problem
for
the
department
to
determine
whether
he
is
in
or
whether
he
is
out,
let
alone
how
much
money
he
is
giving
her
when
his
payments
vary.
but
in
the
military
situation,
it's
very
easy
to
check
that
he
is
out
and
it
is
easy
to
check
when
he
is
going
to
be
coming
back
and
it's
also
very
easy
to
check
what
the
allotment
is
going
to
be
because
the
regulations
are
so
standardized
that
once
the
welfare
worker
knows
what
his
level
in
the
service
is,
she
can
determine
how
much
money
the
family
is
going
to
receive.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
each
case
would
have
to
be
determined
on
its
merits,
but
that's
all
that
we
are
arguing
here
today
is
that
each
case
must
be
determined
on
its
merits.
i
would
say
that
if
he
was
living
off
the
base,
the
family
was
there,
then
no,
he
would
not
be
eligible
for
benefits.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
your
honor,
that's
the
point
where
you
have
to
determine
each
case
individually
because
there
might
certain
situations
where
the
family
could
not
live
with
him
in
seattle;
there
might
be
other
situations
where
the
family
could.
i
believe
the
district
court
pointed
out
this
kind
of
problem.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
well,
i
would
disagree
with
that.
i
mean,
even
in
those
categories,
the
families
have
to
be
treated
on
an
individual
basis.
it
may
be
that
one
person
goes
to
jail
for
a
day
and
that
doesn't
qualify
his
family
for
afdc
assistance.
it
may
be
that
another
father
goes
to
jail
for
a
year
and
his
family
would
be
qualified.
in
each
case,
you
have
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
parent
is
actually
continually
absent
from
the
home.
that's
all
we
are
asking
you
in
this
case
that
our
clients
be
given
the
chance
to
show
that
there
is
an
actual
non-physical
presence
of
father.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
no,
i
believe
that
is
correct.
i
was
answering
the
question
as
to
whether
all
groups
are
considered
as
a
group
or
whether
within
certain
groups,
the
individuals
are
allowed
to
present
the
case
individually.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
as
military
man.
the
second
part
of
california's
argument
is
an
attempt
to
distinguish
this
case
from
the
townsend
case.
now
in
the
townsend
case,
this
court
further
annunciated
the
principle
of
king
versus
smith
which
was
that
at
least
in
the
absence
of
congressional
authorization
for
the
exclusion,
clearly
evidenced
from
the
social
security
act
or
its
legislative
history,
a
state
eligibility
standard
that
excludes
persons
eligible
for
assistance
under
federal
afdc
standards
violates
the
social
security
act.
now
i
don't
think
we
have
anything
in
the
record
to
show
that
congress
meant
to
exclude
needy
military
orphans
from
the
coverage
of
the
afdc
act.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
yes,
your
honor.
and
if
there
is
ambiguity
in
this
definition
then
it
must
be
supplied
by
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
subject
to
reinterpretation
by
the
court.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
would
compare
this
case
to
the
king
case.
in
the
king
case,
this
court
was
concerned
with
what
does
the
word
parent
mean.
now,
the
word
parent
is
certainly
as
ambiguous
as
the
term
continued
absence
from
the
home.
yet
in
that
case,
this
court
looked
at
the
legislative
history
and
at
the
act
to
determine
what
parent
meant
and
once
it
determined
what
parent
meant,
it
held
that
the
states
were
bound
to
provide
afdc
benefits
to
all
children
who
fell
under
the
definition.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
your
honor,
i
believe
--
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
yes,
your
honor
that
was
the
first
part
of
the
argument
and
we
used
to
support
that
claim,
the
interpretation
of
hew
in
the
plain
english
language
of
the
words.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
your
honor,
if
we
are
wrong
and
congress
meant
--
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
your
honor,
it
does
as
far
as
the
initial
issue
which
is
whether
or
not
these
children
are
federally
eligible.
that
is
if
california
chose
to
provide
benefits
to
these
children
are
federal
matching
funds
available
and
the
position
of
hew
is
quite
clear,
federal
matching
funds
are
available.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
that
is
correct,
plus
the
plain
language
of
the
regulation
that
you
read
from.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
yes,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
the
court
below
quite
properly
decided
this
case
on
statutory
grounds.
however,
we
did
argue
below
and
we
argue
here
that
if
that
the
california
regulation
does
deny
nancy
remillard
and
the
members
of
her
class
the
equal
protection
and
due
process
of
the
laws
as
guaranteed
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
would
point
that
california
provides
afdc
benefits
to
children
in
which
a
parent
is
absent
from
the
home
because
of
divorce,
desertion,
separation,
incarceration,
deportation,
hospitalization.
it
does
not
provide
benefits
for
the
child
who's
parent
is
separated
from
the
home
because
of
military
absence.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
or
for
a
child
who's
parent
is
away
for
civilian
employment.
yet,
in
a
program
with
the
focuses
on
the
child,
the
situation
of
the
child
is
the
same
in
any
of
these
cases.
the
california
exclusion,
it
cannot
be
viewed
as
simply
a
case
where
the
state
will
not
provide
benefits
if
the
absence
is
voluntary
because
the
state
provides
benefits
in
the
cases
of
voluntary
divorce
and
voluntary
separation.
it
cannot
be
looked
at
as
a
case
in
which
the
absence
is
going
to
be
for
a
known
time
rather
than
an
unknown
time
because
the
state
does
provide
afdc
benefits
when
a
parent
is
absent
from
the
home,
for
almost
30
days
because
of
incarceration.
that
it
further
cannot
be
looked
as
a
general
exclusion
from
afdc
program
of
children
who
have
some
money
coming
into
them.
in
the
case
of
divorce
or
desertion,
there
maybe
regular
child
support
for
payments
coming
in.
but
if
the
difference
between
the
child's
--
that
the
state
will
pay
the
difference
between
the
child
support
payment
and
the
standard
of
need
as
determined
by
the
state.
that's
all
that
we're
asking
that
the
state
do
in
this
case,
that
it
pay
the
difference
between
what
the
child
is
getting
and
what
the
state
says
that
child
needs
to
live
on.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
yes.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
that's
correct.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
yes.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
yes.
your
honor,
i
would
point
out
that
congress
in
enacting
the
afdc-u
program
under
section
407
of
the
act,
it
specifically
provided
that
the
states
would
define
the
term
unemployment.
it
did
not
do
that
in
the
case
of
continued
absence.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
that's
the
position
of
hew
and
of
the
state.
we
feel
that
ignores
the
plain
holding
and
the
plain
language
of
the
townsend
case
in
which
this
court
expressly
repudiated
the
position
of
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
that
it
could
delegate
to
the
states
the
decision
whether
or
not
to
participate
in
certain
programs.
as
far
as
the
constitutional
argument
is
concerned,
we
further
maintain
that
the
state
by
its
conclusive
presumption
that
a
parent
is
not
absent
from
the
home
when
everybody
admits
that
father
is
absent
from
the
home,
has
denied
to
the
appellees,
the
due
process
of
the
law.
i
would
emphasize
at
this
point
that
we
are
not
stating
that
in
every
single
case,
where
there
is
a
needy
child
and
where
there
is
military
service
that
that
family
is
eligible
for
afdc
benefits.
we
are
only
stating
that
or
we
are
only
asking
that
this
court
to
hold
that
the
state
of
california
cannot
via
conclusive
presumption,
prevent
the
members
of
this
class
from
proving
what
everybody
knows
is
true.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
thank
you.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issues
that
are
presented
for
this
court
in
this
case
and
the
structures
within
which
they
are
presented
are
straightforward.
the
federal
social
security
act
of
1935
provided
for
the
implementation
of
the
afdc
program.
under
that
statute,
states
which
provide
financial
assistance
to
families,
with
what
are
called
dependent
children,
may
be
provided
federal
matching
funds
--
will
be
provided
federal
matching
funds.
the
federal
social
security
act
further
defines
a
dependent
child
as
one
who
has
been
deprived
of
parental
support
or
care
by
reason
of
the
death
--
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
our
argument
is
that
it
does
not.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
your
honor,
i
think
the
district
court
opinion
is
somewhat
ambiguous
on
that
subject.
however,
in
light
of
the
rest
of
the
opinion,
i
think
what
the
district
court
was
saying
was
that
the
court
or
the
state
must
determined
on
an
individual
basis
as
to
whether
or
not
continued
absence
exists
in
a
particular
case,
including
in
the
military
service
case.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
that
is
correct.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
however,
in
light
of
the
townsend
case
which
expressly
disapproved
hew's,
what
is
it
known
as
a
condition
'x'
--
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
--
i
think
that
is
no
longer
a
proper
interpretation
--
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
pardon
me.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
i
think
it
is
your
honor.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
i
believe
that
it
is
a
part
of
the
condition
'x'
which
was
expressly
disapproved
by
this
court
in
townsend
v.
swank.
the
court
below
found
that
--
california
has
further
defined
the
term
dependent
child
by
providing
that
when
a
needy
child
is
deprived
of
parental
support
or
care
by
reason
of
the
continued
absence
of
a
parent
and
that
absence
is
occasioned
by
his
military
service,
there
is
no
continued
absence
such
as
to
give
rise
to
dependency
and
afdc
eligibility.
the
court
below
found
the
state
regulation
invalid
on
two
grounds.
one
that
the
social
security
act
mandates
that
all
eligible
individuals
be
granted
afdc
benefits
with
reason
proffers,
and
number
two
that
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
in
its
implementing
regulation
mandated
that
the
states
in
developing
their
policy
as
to
what
constitutes
continued
absence
from
the
home
must
take
into
consideration
military
absence.
and
the
court
further
read
this
to
provide
that
the
states
must
consider
each
case
on
its
individual
merits
and
not
on
the
basis
of
the
group
to
which
our
case
belongs.
i
would
add
at
this
point
that
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare
through
the
solicitor
general
has
filed
a
brief
in
this
case,
indicating
that
it
agrees
with
appellant's
argument
that
the
states
are
free
to
define
continued
absence
from
the
home
as
they
choose,
but
indicating
that
it
disagrees
with
appellant's
argument
that
military
orphans
as
we
have
called
them
are
not
federally
eligible
for
afdc
benefits,
and
it
is
the
second
argument
that
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
first.
we
submit
that
when
congress
used
the
words
continued
absence
from
the
home
that
it
meant
exactly
what
the
plain
english
definition
of
those
words
is.
when
congress
said
continued
absence
from
the
home,
it
meant
those
situations
in
which
a
parent
is
not
physically
present
in
the
home
and
this
non-presence
can
be
expected
to
continue
for
a
certain
length
of
time
which
are
called
continued.
i
would
point
out
as
an
example
of
what
continued
absence
means,
the
situation
of
the
remillard
family
in
this
case.
mr.
remillard
was
in
vietnam
for
over
a
year.
during
the
time
he
was
in
vietnam,
he
was
not
allowed
to
return
to
his
family.
his
family
was
not
allowed
to
go
and
visit
him.
by
army
regulation,
the
family
was
not
even
allowed
to
move
to
a
point
where
they
would
be
near
him.
and
certainly
in
this
case,
whatever
continued
absence
might
mean,
it
was
present
here
and
i
would
point
out
that
the
state
has
stipulated
that
there
was
continued
absence
in
this
case.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
and
that
his
family
had
been
free
to
join
him?
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
alright,
if
mr.
remillard
had
been
the
ambassador
and
if
his
family
were
not
free
to
join
him
and
if
by
some
chance
that
family
were
also
needy
that
is
according
to
this
california
definition,
unable
to
provide
the
basic
necessities
of
life,
then
i
would
say,
yes,
that
family
would
be
eligible
for
afdc
benefits.
of
course,
in
the
case
of
the
ambassador
it's
highly
unlikely
that
the
family
would
be
financially
needy.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
for
grades
e1,
e2,
e3,
and
e4,
the
regulations
provide
that
a
serviceman
may
initiate
the
basic
allotment
which
consists
of
the
basic
allowance
for
quarters
which
is
called
to
baq
and
which
is
a
separate
from
the
serviceman's
pay
and
which
also
includes
$40
per
month
which
is
taken
out
of
the
serviceman's
pay.
now
if
the
--
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
well,
the
regulations
provide
that
he
may,
but
they
further
provide
that
if
he
does
not
and
if
the
wife
objects
that
certain
procedures
will
be
followed
to
ensure
that
she
does
receive
her
allotment.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
from
the
same
sources,
the
$105
for
grades
e1,
e2,
and
e3,
slightly
more
for
grade
e4,
which
comes
from
outside
his
pay
and
$40
which
comes
from
in
his
pay.
now
there
is
also
a
provision
in
the
allotment
system
that
the
serviceman
may
voluntarily
add
more
to
this
allotment,
but
we
are
here
considering
with
cases
where
the
amount
of
money
that
is
coming
from
the
serviceman
is
inadequate
to
care
for
the
basic
needs
of
the
family.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
yes.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
and
if
that
money
were
actually
coming
into
that
child,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
interpretation
of
the
term
continued
absence
follows
this
common
sense
approach
as
to
what
the
term
means.
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
in
its
section
3422.2
of
handbook
of
public
assistance
administration,
part
iv
has
defined
continued
absence
from
the
home
as,
(1)
when
the
parent
is
out
of
the
home,
there
is
a
clear
situation
here;
(2)
when
the
nature
of
the
absence
is
such
as
to
either
interrupt
or
terminate
the
parent's
functioning
as
a
provider
of
maintenance,
physical
care,
or
guidance
for
the
child.
and
i
would
point
out
here
that
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
is
concerned
not
only
with
the
fact
that
the
father
is
not
able
to
adequately
support
his
family
financially,
but
with
the
fact
that
the
father
is
not
present
in
the
home
to
provide
the
kind
of
physical
care
and
emotional
nurturance
that
the
child
needs.
hew
has
one
further
consideration,
when
the
known
or
indefinite
duration
of
the
absence
precludes
counting
on
the
parent's
performance
of
his
function
in
planning
for
the
present
support
or
care
of
the
child.
that
is
certainly
also
the
situation
we
have
here.
remillard
was
in
vietnam
for
a
year.
during
that
time
he
was
not
available
to
help
take
care
of
the
child
to
make
plans
concerning
her
future.
the
longstanding
interpretation
of
hew
is
that
military
orphans
are
federally
eligible
for
afdc
benefits.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
are,
yes,
your
honor.
for
at
least
25
years,
federal
matching
payments
have
been
made
to
those
states
which
do
grant
afdc
benefits
to
needy
military
orphans.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
that's
correct,
your
honor,
i
think.
there
are
two
different
issues
here.
the
first
one
is,
are
the
children
federally
eligible
and
the
second
is,
if
the
children
are
federally
eligible
then
may
the
states
deny
them
these
benefits.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
there
are
some
20
off
states
plus
the
district
of
columbia
which
do
grant
benefits
to
all
needy
military
orphans.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
yes,
your
honor.
the
states
also
make
some
further
distinctions.
for
example,
at
the
time
when
filed
this
case,
there
were
two
states
and
there
is
now
one
state
that
gives
afdc
benefits
to
the
needy
children
of
draftees,
but
not
to
the
needy
children
of
enlistees.
there
are
two
further
states
which
grant
afdc
benefits
to
the
needy
children
of
draftees
or
men
who
have
enlisted
in
order
to
avoid
the
draft,
but
not
to
the
needy
children
of
men
who
have
enlisted.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
[attempt
to
laughter]
that's
right.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
your
honor.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
that
is
correct.
i
don't
know
what
the
division
of
states
was
at
that
time.
the
afdc
program
focuses
on
the
child.
this
was
stated
by
this
court
in
the
case
of
king
v.
smith
and
it's
been
reiterated
several
times.
what
is
important
is
the
status
of
a
child,
not
the
legal
status
of
the
parents.
now,
a
regulation
such
as
california
has,
can
lead
to
certain
very
absurd
results
and
as
an
example
of
this,
i
would
point
out
the
situation
of
the
intervener
in
this
case,
joyce
dones.
part
of
the
intervention
of
this
action
joyce
dones
and
her
husband
and
their
two
children
were
living
together.
she
was
also
expecting
a
third
child.
mr.
dones
was
working
full-time
and
supporting
his
family.
mr.
dones
was
then
ordered
to
submit
to
induction
to
the
army
and
he
was
then
sent
to
his
basic
training.
by
army
regulation,
his
family
was
not
allowed
to
join
him
at
the
site
of
the
basic
training.
now,
if
mr.
dones
instead
of
submitting
to
induction,
if
he
had
refused
induction
and
then
subsequently
been
arrested,
convicted
and
sentenced
for
this
unlawful
act,
there
is
no
question
but
that
in
california
his
children
would
have
been
eligible
for
afdc
benefits.
now
as
far
as
the
child
is
concerned,
there
probably
wouldn't
have
been
much
difference.
in
each
case,
the
father
would
have
been
gone
for
certain
length
of
time.
if
he
was
in
jail,
she
would
more
likely
be
able
to
visit
the
father
and
if
he
was
in
jail,
he
probably
didn't
have
as
many
chances
of
being
killed,
but
yet
in
one
case,
the
child
is
eligible
for
afdc
benefits
and
in
the
other
case,
the
child
is
not
eligible.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
except
for
the
fact
that
in
this
case,
need
is
not
in
question.
by
the
standards
developed
by
the
california
department
of
social
welfare
our
class
is
composed
only
of
needy
children,
children
who
aren't
getting
anything
and
i
would
further
point
out
that
in
the
case
of
nancy
remillard,
when
we
first
filed
this
action,
she
wasn't
getting
anything
either.
she
wasn't
getting
any
allotment.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
we
do
not
contend
that
the
family
would
have
been
eligible
for
afdc
benefits
--
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
[attempt
to
laughter]
we
are
dwelling
here
on
the
statutory
argument
--
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
okay,
if
the
father
were
living
at
home,
there
are,
of
course,
certain
economies
of
living
about
maintaining
only
one
household
and
also
the
father
would
be
available
to
help
with
the
physical
care
of
the
children,
he
would
be
available
to
provide
guidance
and
possibly
in
some
situations,
he
would
be
able
to
take
a
second
job.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
yes.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
in
california,
if
a
husband
is
sent
to
jail
and
if
he
is
released
on
the
work
furlough
program,
which
is
a
procedure
whereby
the
husband
goes
to
work
and
then
returns
to
jail
for
the
night
or
for
the
day,
if
he
happens
to
be
working
in
the
night
shift,
even
in
the
case
like
this,
where
the
husband
is
employed,
the
family
will
be
granted
afdc
benefits
based
upon
his
absence
if
the
family
is,
in
fact,
needy
and
i
think
this
is
very
close
to
that
situation.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
no,
your
honor,
i
would
only
point
out
that
congress
is
currently
considering
enhancement,
considering
for
some
time,
the
family
assistance
program
and
one
of
the
provisions
in
that
program
is
that
the
families
who
are
assisted
must
be
intact
families
living
together.
and
--
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
i
don't
know
of
any
proposals
that
deal
specifically
with
the
military
problem.
i
would
note
that
congress
has
simply
acquiesced
in
the
hew
definition
which
does
include
military
orphans.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
well,
we
maintain
there
are
two
parts
to
that
definition.
the
first
part
is
that
they
are
eligible
and
the
second
part
is
what
we
maintain
has
been
--
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
that's
correct,
your
honor.
at
this
point
we
are
only
dealing
with
whether
or
not
they
are
federally
eligible
and
the
second
part
of
the
argument
is
concerned
with
whether
or
not
this
case
is
outside
the
scope
of
townsend
v.
swank.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
your
honor,
we
would
agree
that
the
military
pay
and
allotment
system
could
be
much
more
equitable.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
oh!
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
absolutely
correct
and
there
is
also
the
problem
that
even
if
the
soldiers
pay
were
raised
to
$10,000
a
year,
there
are
always
going
to
occur
situations
like
nancy
remillard
found
herself
in,
she
wasn't
getting
any
money.
somehow
the
allotment
system
had
broken
down
and
she
didn't
have
any
money,
not
even
this
very
low
sum
that
the
military
does
send.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
your
honor,
our
contention
is
that
this
would
be
very
simple
to
administer
and
i
would
compare
it
to
the
situation
where
you
have
parents
who
are
separated
by
agreement.
in
that
kind
of
a
situation,
you
frequently
find
a
father
who
is
absent,
and
who
returns
to
the
home
to
visit
the
children,
to
see
his
wife
for
whatever
reason
and
there
is
a
real
administrative
problem
for
the
department
to
determine
whether
he
is
in
or
whether
he
is
out,
let
alone
how
much
money
he
is
giving
her
when
his
payments
vary.
but
in
the
military
situation,
it's
very
easy
to
check
that
he
is
out
and
it
is
easy
to
check
when
he
is
going
to
be
coming
back
and
it's
also
very
easy
to
check
what
the
allotment
is
going
to
be
because
the
regulations
are
so
standardized
that
once
the
welfare
worker
knows
what
his
level
in
the
service
is,
she
can
determine
how
much
money
the
family
is
going
to
receive.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
each
case
would
have
to
be
determined
on
its
merits,
but
that's
all
that
we
are
arguing
here
today
is
that
each
case
must
be
determined
on
its
merits.
i
would
say
that
if
he
was
living
off
the
base,
the
family
was
there,
then
no,
he
would
not
be
eligible
for
benefits.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
your
honor,
that's
the
point
where
you
have
to
determine
each
case
individually
because
there
might
certain
situations
where
the
family
could
not
live
with
him
in
seattle;
there
might
be
other
situations
where
the
family
could.
i
believe
the
district
court
pointed
out
this
kind
of
problem.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
well,
i
would
disagree
with
that.
i
mean,
even
in
those
categories,
the
families
have
to
be
treated
on
an
individual
basis.
it
may
be
that
one
person
goes
to
jail
for
a
day
and
that
doesn't
qualify
his
family
for
afdc
assistance.
it
may
be
that
another
father
goes
to
jail
for
a
year
and
his
family
would
be
qualified.
in
each
case,
you
have
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
parent
is
actually
continually
absent
from
the
home.
that's
all
we
are
asking
you
in
this
case
that
our
clients
be
given
the
chance
to
show
that
there
is
an
actual
non-physical
presence
of
father.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
no,
i
believe
that
is
correct.
i
was
answering
the
question
as
to
whether
all
groups
are
considered
as
a
group
or
whether
within
certain
groups,
the
individuals
are
allowed
to
present
the
case
individually.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
as
military
man.
the
second
part
of
california's
argument
is
an
attempt
to
distinguish
this
case
from
the
townsend
case.
now
in
the
townsend
case,
this
court
further
annunciated
the
principle
of
king
versus
smith
which
was
that
at
least
in
the
absence
of
congressional
authorization
for
the
exclusion,
clearly
evidenced
from
the
social
security
act
or
its
legislative
history,
a
state
eligibility
standard
that
excludes
persons
eligible
for
assistance
under
federal
afdc
standards
violates
the
social
security
act.
now
i
don't
think
we
have
anything
in
the
record
to
show
that
congress
meant
to
exclude
needy
military
orphans
from
the
coverage
of
the
afdc
act.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
yes,
your
honor.
and
if
there
is
ambiguity
in
this
definition
then
it
must
be
supplied
by
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
subject
to
reinterpretation
by
the
court.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
would
compare
this
case
to
the
king
case.
in
the
king
case,
this
court
was
concerned
with
what
does
the
word
parent
mean.
now,
the
word
parent
is
certainly
as
ambiguous
as
the
term
continued
absence
from
the
home.
yet
in
that
case,
this
court
looked
at
the
legislative
history
and
at
the
act
to
determine
what
parent
meant
and
once
it
determined
what
parent
meant,
it
held
that
the
states
were
bound
to
provide
afdc
benefits
to
all
children
who
fell
under
the
definition.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
your
honor,
i
believe
--
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
yes,
your
honor
that
was
the
first
part
of
the
argument
and
we
used
to
support
that
claim,
the
interpretation
of
hew
in
the
plain
english
language
of
the
words.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
your
honor,
if
we
are
wrong
and
congress
meant
--
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
your
honor,
it
does
as
far
as
the
initial
issue
which
is
whether
or
not
these
children
are
federally
eligible.
that
is
if
california
chose
to
provide
benefits
to
these
children
are
federal
matching
funds
available
and
the
position
of
hew
is
quite
clear,
federal
matching
funds
are
available.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
that
is
correct,
plus
the
plain
language
of
the
regulation
that
you
read
from.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
yes,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
the
court
below
quite
properly
decided
this
case
on
statutory
grounds.
however,
we
did
argue
below
and
we
argue
here
that
if
that
the
california
regulation
does
deny
nancy
remillard
and
the
members
of
her
class
the
equal
protection
and
due
process
of
the
laws
as
guaranteed
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
would
point
that
california
provides
afdc
benefits
to
children
in
which
a
parent
is
absent
from
the
home
because
of
divorce,
desertion,
separation,
incarceration,
deportation,
hospitalization.
it
does
not
provide
benefits
for
the
child
who's
parent
is
separated
from
the
home
because
of
military
absence.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
or
for
a
child
who's
parent
is
away
for
civilian
employment.
yet,
in
a
program
with
the
focuses
on
the
child,
the
situation
of
the
child
is
the
same
in
any
of
these
cases.
the
california
exclusion,
it
cannot
be
viewed
as
simply
a
case
where
the
state
will
not
provide
benefits
if
the
absence
is
voluntary
because
the
state
provides
benefits
in
the
cases
of
voluntary
divorce
and
voluntary
separation.
it
cannot
be
looked
at
as
a
case
in
which
the
absence
is
going
to
be
for
a
known
time
rather
than
an
unknown
time
because
the
state
does
provide
afdc
benefits
when
a
parent
is
absent
from
the
home,
for
almost
30
days
because
of
incarceration.
that
it
further
cannot
be
looked
as
a
general
exclusion
from
afdc
program
of
children
who
have
some
money
coming
into
them.
in
the
case
of
divorce
or
desertion,
there
maybe
regular
child
support
for
payments
coming
in.
but
if
the
difference
between
the
child's
--
that
the
state
will
pay
the
difference
between
the
child
support
payment
and
the
standard
of
need
as
determined
by
the
state.
that's
all
that
we're
asking
that
the
state
do
in
this
case,
that
it
pay
the
difference
between
what
the
child
is
getting
and
what
the
state
says
that
child
needs
to
live
on.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
yes.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
that's
correct.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
yes.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
yes.
your
honor,
i
would
point
out
that
congress
in
enacting
the
afdc-u
program
under
section
407
of
the
act,
it
specifically
provided
that
the
states
would
define
the
term
unemployment.
it
did
not
do
that
in
the
case
of
continued
absence.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
that's
the
position
of
hew
and
of
the
state.
we
feel
that
ignores
the
plain
holding
and
the
plain
language
of
the
townsend
case
in
which
this
court
expressly
repudiated
the
position
of
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
that
it
could
delegate
to
the
states
the
decision
whether
or
not
to
participate
in
certain
programs.
as
far
as
the
constitutional
argument
is
concerned,
we
further
maintain
that
the
state
by
its
conclusive
presumption
that
a
parent
is
not
absent
from
the
home
when
everybody
admits
that
father
is
absent
from
the
home,
has
denied
to
the
appellees,
the
due
process
of
the
law.
i
would
emphasize
at
this
point
that
we
are
not
stating
that
in
every
single
case,
where
there
is
a
needy
child
and
where
there
is
military
service
that
that
family
is
eligible
for
afdc
benefits.
we
are
only
stating
that
or
we
are
only
asking
that
this
court
to
hold
that
the
state
of
california
cannot
via
conclusive
presumption,
prevent
the
members
of
this
class
from
proving
what
everybody
knows
is
true.
ms.
carmen
l.
massey
thank
you.
