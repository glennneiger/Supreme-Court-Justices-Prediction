justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
your
cause
of
action
against
new
york?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
saying
new
york
is
doing
that
by
letting
the
sludge
to
accumulate
on
its
lake
part?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
have
got
two
suits
here,
you
got
one
against
international
paper
company
and
one
against
the
state,
i
mean
at
least
you
have
got
two
parties?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
already
(inaudible)
that
you
could
litigate
against
the
international
paper
company
in
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
federal
law
would
control
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
(inaudible)
hasn't
named
new
york
at
all
and
you
sued
them
in
the
federal
district
court,
sued
international
paper
in
the
federal
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
be
asking
for
the
application
of
the
same
law
that
you'd
be
asking
here,
correct?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
would
be
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
say
if
you
were
suing
international
paper
alone
in
this
court
and
surely
that
would
be
a
case
within
our
jurisdiction
and
you
were
claiming
that
this
sludge
bed
was
nuisance.
now
you
would
be
asking
every
implication
of
federal
law,
wouldn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
you
think
that
any
different
law
would
apply
if
you
were
suing
in
the
federal
district
court
which
has
contract
jurisdiction
in
that
kind
of
a
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
asking
for
a
federal
--
you
are
just
suing
on
a
federal
question
as
a
matter
of
a
federal
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
that
it
had
been
that
--
let's
assume
that
you
are
suing
in
this
court
international
paper
company
alone
and
this
court
decided
federal
law
applies
and
then
in
a
identical
suit
on
the
facts
between
the
state
and
another
company,
this
suit
is
brought
in
the
federal
district
court.
wouldn't
you
think
the
same
law
would
apply?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
did
in
(inaudible),
didn't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
the
only
way,
there
isn't
anything
against
it
either,
is
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
only
authority
there
is,
this
pankey
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
terms
of
the
equitable
law,
which
says
a
state
law
should
control
--
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
you
are
sued
in
vermont,
what
would
be
the
governing
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
new
york,
the

justice
byron
r.
white
what
new
york
says
that
--
justice
byron

if
you
are
sued,
what
if
the
--
what
if
under
the
new

law
of
the
maintenance
of
the
sludge
bed
is
not
a
nuisance?
justice
byron

are
saying
that
the
vermont
says
if
the
injury
is
occurring
from
new
york
maintaining
on
its
land
this
sludge
bed?
justice
byron

river
cases

a
state
sues
a

the
applicable
law?

what
the

white
no
one
is
state
contact.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
see
anything
inconsistent
with
your
position
that
you
suggested,
perhaps
there
might
be
a
federal
common-law
of
nuisance
cause
of
action,
but
also
a
safe
one?
justice
byron
