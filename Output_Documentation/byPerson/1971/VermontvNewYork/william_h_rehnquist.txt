mr.
parker,
why
can't
the
state
of
vermont
get
relieved
against
international
paper,
putting
to
one
side
the
question
of
state
of
new
york,
in
our
own
courts
but
the
type
of
wrong
that
you've
just
described?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
mr.

does
new

concede
that
if

either
in
the
federal
court
in
vermont
or
in
the
state
court
of
vermont
without
new
york
being
a
party
or
an
intervener,
and
vermont
got
a
decree
of
final
relief
calling
for
the
abatement
of
the
sludge
bed,
that
the
state
of
new
york
would
be
bound
by
that
decree,
so
that
it
couldn’t
interfere
with
carrying
it
out?
