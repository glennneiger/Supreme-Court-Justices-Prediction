the
operation
is
now
finished,
isn't
it?
hasn't
that
perhaps
closed?
justice
potter
stewart
a
new
plant
has
been
built
few
miles
away?
justice
potter
stewart
as
of
now,
there
is
no
complaint
against
the
operations
of
the
new
plant?
justice
potter
stewart
just
before
you
move
to
that,
do
i
understand
that
the
sludge
bed
is
on
the
bottom
of
the
lake
on
the
new
york
side
of
the
boundary?
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
something
in
the
record
to
the
effect
that
it's
been
building
up
over
many
years
and
there
are
other
contributors
to
it
in
addition
to
many
other
--
many
other
contributors
in
addition
to
the
paper
company,
this
paper
company?
is
that
--
the
paper
company
is
the
sole
cause
of
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
is
way
down
to
the
southern
tip
of
the
lake,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
down
around
port
henry.
justice
potter
stewart
ticonderoga
is
not
--
is
ticonderoga
on
the
lake?
justice
potter
stewart
how
far
from
the
lake?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
there
wouldn't
be
a
diversity
case,
by
definition.
you
said
that
a
state
is
not
a
citizen
of
another
state,
it
wouldn't
and
couldn't
be
a
diversity
case
and
the
erie
railroad
rule
is
applicable
to
diversity
cases?
justice
potter
stewart
what
did
wyandotte
had
to
say
on
this
subject?
justice
potter
stewart
but
perhaps
i
should
explain
them
all
on
the
basis
that
the
court
understood,
that
the
state
of
ohio
was
asserting
an
ohio
cause
of
action
under
the
ohio
nuisance
law?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
one
very
great
big
difference
thought
is
there
not?
in
wyandotte,
there
was
no
state,
there
was
a
defendant.
there
was
not
a
controversy
between
two
states.
therefore
this
court's
--
well
jurisdiction
existed
in
this
court,
it
was
not
exclusive
jurisdiction.
controversy
between
two
states
is
exclusively
within
this
court's
jurisdiction,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well
that
is
a
separate
point
but
this
--
that
on
its
face
is
what
differentiates
this
case
from
wyandotte,
among
other?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
mr.
weinberg
doesn't
it
also
go
to
new
york
maybe
--
new
york
state
maybe
a
necessary
party.
the
sludge
bed
is
largely
on
the
sub
--
surface
of
the
lake
on
the
new
york
side
of
the
line,
and
its
vermont’s
intention
that
the
way
to
abate
this
nuisance,
to
get
rid
of
it
is
to
remove
the
sludge
bed
and
new
york
strenuously
says,
no
that’s
absolutely
the
wrong
thing
to
do.
so
if
a
court
should
order
the
paper
company
to
remove
the
sludge
bed,
and
then
new
york
would
just
step
in
and
say,
i
am
sorry,
we
enjoin
you
from
removing
the
sludge
bed
and
it’s
on
our
territory,
and
isn't
that
the
reason
why
new
york
state
might
be
a
necessary
party
to
cleanup
these
factual
issues
in
this
litigation
vis-a-vis
the
remedy
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
they
would
enjoin
this
--
the
removal
of
the
sludge
bed?
justice
potter
stewart
perhaps
you
didn't
understand
my
--
i
was
just
directing
myself
to
the
questioning
the
reason
and
why
new
york
state
might
be
a
necessary
party
as
of
course
it
could
not
be
in
either
a
state
or
federal
court
except
for
this
court,
isn’t
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
certainly
strenuously
asserted
in
your
brief
and
you
just
began
to
assert
in
oral
either
the
removal
of
the
sludge
bed
is
exactly
what
would
be
the
wrong
thing
to
do?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
vermont
would
be
or
to
the
defendant?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
just
suggested
a
possible
reason?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
kind
of
a
primary
jurisdiction
argument
or
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
now
mr.
whipple
there
is
a
litigation
(inaudible)
against
your
client
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
vermont,
is
there?
justice
potter
stewart
not
on
federal
question,
on
diversity?
justice
potter
stewart
how
far
has
that
litigation
gone,
i
am
just
curious
to
know
whether
--
how
the
district
court
there
feels
about
what
kind
of
substantive
law
is
applicable?
justice
potter
stewart
who
is
john,
what
was
he
representing,
the
town's
people
or
the
---?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
propriety
of
the
class?
justice
potter
stewart
the
operation
is
now
finished,
isn't
it?
hasn't
that
perhaps
closed?
justice
potter
stewart
a
new
plant
has
been
built
few
miles
away?
justice
potter
stewart
as
of
now,
there
is
no
complaint
against
the
operations
of
the
new
plant?
justice
potter
stewart
just
before
you
move
to
that,
do
i
understand
that
the
sludge
bed
is
on
the
bottom
of
the

on
the

this

is
that
--
the
paper

is
the

of
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
is
way
down
to
the
southern
tip
of
the
lake,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
down
around
port
henry.
justice
potter
stewart
ticonderoga
is
not
--
is
ticonderoga
on
the
lake?
justice
potter
stewart
how
far
from
the

justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice

there

in

therefore
this

well

court,
it

not

controversy
between
two
states
is
exclusively
within
this
court's
jurisdiction,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well
that
is
a

this

that
on

this

mr.

doesn't

maybe
