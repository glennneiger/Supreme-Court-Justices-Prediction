mr.
taggart
whipple
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
international
paper
company.
our
position
in
this
litigation
is,
i'll
say
at
the
outset
three-fold.
we
agree
with
vermont
that
the
complaint
does
not
state
a
real
justiciable
claim
against
the
state
of
new
york.
secondly,
that
this
court
should
refuse
to
exercise
jurisdiction
as
it
did
in
wyandotte.
thirdly,
that
as
far
as
governing
law
goes,
the
governing
law
in
the
state
of
vermont's
claim
against
new
york
is
federal
law,
but
as
far
as
vermont's
claim
against
the
international
paper
company
goes
it
should
be
state
law.
before
i
get
into
the
law,
i'd
like
to
perhaps
amplify
startly
on
some
of
the
factual
questions
that
were
asked
this
morning.
with
respect
to
your
question
mr.
chief
justice
about
the
area
involved
and
so
on,
i
visited
the
area,
or
i
tramped
through
the
two
mills,
one
of
which
is
closed,
the
new
mill
which
is
now
open.
i
think
you
should
try
to
visualize
this
part
of
the
lake
as
a
very
narrow,
almost
like
the
closing
mouth
of
the
funnel.
you
fly
over
the
latter
part
of
the
lake,
you'll
see
that
latter
part
of
the
lake,
including
ticonderoga
and
crown
point
is
mudding
throughout
as
the
lake
broadens
and
gets
to
be
clear
and
much
different.
the
sludge
bed
itself
which
lies
in
the
northern
ticonderoga
creek
which
empties
into
lake
champlain
covers
some
300
acres.
some
of
it
is
covered
by
marsh
grass.
in
fact
it
amused
me
when
i
was
there
to
see
that
one
of
the
colored
postcards
that's
sold
at
port
ticonderoga
shows
the
view
over
the
sludge
bed
so
there
is
no
aesthetically
difficult
proposition
here.
the
area
involved
in
contrast
to
the
whole
area
of
lake
champlain
is
a
very
limited
area
indeed.
finally,
mr.
justice
stewart
and
i
believe
mr.
justice
blackmun
talked
about
the
new
mill,
i'd
like
to
say
a
word
about
that.
the
paper
company
has
long
been
concerned
about
the
discharge
problem
in
the
old
mill.
over
five
years
ago,
it
planned
this
new
mill,
it
cost
$76
million.
it
contains
the
most
modern
water
treatment
facilities
that
were
available,
which
cost
between
$3-4
million,
and
as
the
state
of
vermont
said
this
morning
there
is
no
problem
about
the
discharges
from
that
mill.
in
fact,
you
can
drink
the
water
when
it
comes
out
of
those
treatment
facilities,
and
people
have
done
it.
as
to
fish
life,
which
is
a
legitimate
ecological
concern,
we
disagree
with
the
statement
this
morning
by
mr.
parker
that
while
fish
life
was
improved
substantially
since
the
discharge
has
stopped
from
the
old
mill,
as
they
did
completely
in
april
1971
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
reversion
to
a
minor
and
poor
fish
life.
in
fact,
it's
not
true
as
i
understand
it
that
conditions
this
summer,
when
the
tests
were
conducted
by
a
firm
(inaudible)
favorable.
the
temperature
of
the
water
rose
to
high
level
soon
than
it
normally
did
and
stayed
there
for
a
longer
time.
i
want
to
emphasize
what
mr.
weinberg
said.
there
is
a
long
standing
dispute
as
to
the
best
way
to
deal
with
this
bed.
mr.
chief
justice
you've
mentioned
the
possibility
of
recovering
it.
there
are
at
least
three
possibilities,
one
is
to
leave
it
where
it
is,
covered
it
or
not
in
some
way;
the
second
is
to
remove
it
and
if
you
remove
it,
what
happens?
i
want
you
to
visualize
this
bed
as
a
light
and
feathery
substance
as
mr.
dime
(ph)
stated
and
mr.
wrickleshouse
(ph)
had
tested
in
the
new
york
state
supplement
brief
points
out.
it's
not
a
thick
heavy
bed.
any
attempt
to
dredge
and
remove
this
operation,
we
are
told
would
destroy
the
ecological
balance
of
the
lake
in
a
most
harmful
fashion
indeed
and
there
is
a
--
there
is
another
question
too.
if
you
remove
it,
where
do
you
put
it
and
what
happens?
certainly
it
would
have
to
be
removed
some
place
fairly
near
to
lake,
and
if
it
were
done
the
best
evidence
from
the
scientist
says
that
a
lot
of
it
will
reach
back
into
the
lake
so
removal
does
not
seem
to
be
a
realistic
alternative.
now
as
to
the
law,
i
don't
need
to
add
anything.
i
think
that
mr.
weinberg's
position,
which
is
basically
that
the
complaining
states
of
course
have
actions
for
maladministration
against
new
york
of
its
own
laws.
however,
as
to
whether
this
court
should
exercise
the
jurisdiction,
and
we
don't
dispute
the
court
as
jurisdiction,
we
contend
that
reasons
of
policy
and
principle
militate
against
the
exercise
of
the
court's
jurisdiction.
even
insofar
as
vermont's
claim
against
new
york
is
concerned,
a
state
against
state
claim,
the
way
the
law
has
developed
as
we
understand
it,
even
though
the
jurisdiction
which
has
given
to
this
court
of
state
against
state
cases
is
exclusive,
it
is
not
mandatory.
in
many
cases,
this
court
has
refused
to
exercise
jurisdiction
for
strong
and
compelling
reasons
of
policy.
in
wyandotte,
while
that
was
a
state
against
citizen
case,
and
obviously
we're
distinct
here
in
the
sense
that
new
york
as
a
party
as
well
as
the
paper
company,
we
contend
that
the
same
considerations
which
militated
against
the
exercise
of
this
court's
jurisdiction
in
wyandotte
should
lead
this
court
to
refuse
to
exercise
jurisdiction
here.
these
factors
are
familiar,
but
i
would
like
to
just
recite
them
and
let
them
into
the
facts
of
our
case.
in
wyandotte,
the
court
pointed
out
that
the
court
would
be
punished
into
a
morass
of
novel,
difficult
scientific,
technical
problems.
the
existence
and
the
manner
of
treating
this
sledge
bed
so
far
as
we
know
are
entirely
novel.
that
is
why
we
tried
to
get
the
best
engineering
experts
we
could
last
summer
to
look
at
it,
and
would
advise
us,
then
advise
the
state
of
new
york
as
what
ought
to
be
done
about
it.
the
mere
differences
to
come
up
this
morning
between
mr.
parker's
statement,
mr.
weinberg's
illustrate
and
underline
the
difficulties
of
these
problems.
i
think
it's
beyond
any
argument
that
if
this
court
would
have
take
the
case,
the
master
would
be
plunged
in
to
a
extremely
difficult
problem
of
fact
finding
and
recommending.
i
don't
think
it's
any
answer
as
vermont
might
suggest
later
on
on
to
say
a
master
can
do
it
all
because
as
we
understand
it
even
after
the
master
does
it,
as
mr.
justice
stone
pointed
out
in
georgia
against
pennsylvania,
there
still
remains
in
this
court,
the
duty
of
independently
examining
the
evidence
itself.
moreover,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
court
would
be
entering
into
an
area
that
congress
has
expressly
refused
to
preempt
and
rather
has
left
to
the
states.
the
policy
of
course,
we
think
would
be
great
if
this
court
would
have
withdrawn
of
into
the
morass
of
tort
litigation
arising
from
water
pollution
at
the
expense
of
its
ability
to
deal
with
the
ever
broadening
range
of
problems
that
come
before
this
court
in
massive
numbers
and
are
federally
oriented.
if
you
were
to
take
this
case,
it's
difficult
for
us
to
see
how
you
can
pick
and
choose
between
other
pollution
cases
which
would
be
sure
to
come
here
and
with
the
environmental
concerns
that
surround
the
countries
(inaudible)
now
we
think
inevitable
they
would
come
here.
we
therefore
suggest
this
case
should
be
resolved
at
the
lower
level.
we
suggest
that
the
proper
course
of
action
is
for
the
court
to
refuse
to
take
this
case
and
to
remit
vermont
to
the
type
of
procedure
that
the
court
has
said
again
and
again
should
prevail
in
these
matters
and
that
is
conference,
concessions,
cooperation
at
the
lower
level
where
these
things
could
and
should
be
resolved.
mr.
taggart
whipple
yes
sir.
mr.
taggart
whipple
we
contend
your
honor,
i
was
just
about
to
get
to
that,
that
we
are
sueable
in
vermont,
we
are
sueable
in
new
york,
we
are
ready
to
stand
sued
there,
there
is
no
question
about
that.
this
is
the
really
available
alternative
that
the
state
of
vermont
has
against
us
insofar
as
remedy
goes,
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
and
i'll
put
it
to
one
side,
but
i
want
to
just
advert
to
it,
in
a
word,
the
availability
of
the
administrative
remedies,
which
we
contend
vermont
has
failed
to
exhaust
and
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
respectfully,
that
in
deciding
whether
the
exercise,
the
court's
discretion
take
a
case
of
this
nature
one
should
look
long
and
hard
to
the
question
as
to
whether
the
state
that
brings
the
case
or
seeks
to
bring
the
case
here
has
in
fact
exhausted
it's
administrative
remedies
in
the
circumstances.
mr.
taggart
whipple
well,
i
don't
know.
i
would
characterize
it
as
an
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
think
you
could
call
it
primary
jurisdiction
too,
it
might
be
both,
it
might
well.
but
my
point
here
is,
i
don't
think
that
the
state
should
come
in
here
and
call
upon
the
really
extraordinary
remedy
of
original
jurisdiction,
which
this
court
has
said
time
and
again,
should
be
sparingly
exercised
and
only
in
unusual
circumstances
when
it
is
refused
as
the
state
of
vermont
refused
in
the
fall
of
1972
to
proceed
with
this
engineering
study
which
mr.
weinberg
will
leave
with
the
court.
the
door
was
slammed
and
it
seems
to
me
in
a
novel
for
a
state
to
stand
before
this
court
and
try
to
invoke
the
original
jurisdiction,
which
should
be
sparingly
exercised
and
which
when
it's
been
called
into
play
and
water
pollution
cases
has
raised
a
host
of
difficulties.
mr.
justice
holmes
spoke
about
this
as
early
as
1900,
72
years
ago
and
it
certainly
not
any
easy
today
than
it
was
then.
so,
i
would
suggest
that
an
element
and
a
strong
element
in
this
court's
discretion
should
be
not
only
the
availability
of
an
alternative
litigating
board
and
we
are
subject
to
suits
in
vermont.
we
never
questioned,
and
also
in
new
york,
but
also
whether
the
state
has
made
a
positive
and
a
genuine
effort
to
exhaust
their
administrative
remedies
and
i
contrast
this
case
against
some
other
cases
argued
here
this
morning.
i
think
there's
every
difference
in
the
will.
mr.
taggart
whipple
yes
sir.
mr.
taggart
whipple
i
would
think
the
state
of
vermont
law.
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
taggart
whipple
i
would
think
so,
i
think
common
law
governs
traditional
nuisance.
it's
one
of
the
oldest
types
of
complaint
known
to
mankind.
i
would
think
this
--
mr.
taggart
whipple
let
me
clarify
one
thing,
may
i?
you
said
that
if
we
are
sued
in
vermont,
the
same
thing.
i
think
probably,
the
law
of
the
place
of
injury
should
govern.
mr.
taggart
whipple
well,
i
find
it
hard
to
accept
that
hypothesis,
but
i
will
arguendo,
if
we
are
sued
in
new
york,
i
would
think
that
the
new
york
court
would
look
to
the
vermont
law
because
that's
the
place
where
their
injury
occurred.
mr.
taggart
whipple
no,
but
the
thrust
of
the
injury,
the
harm
visits
itself
across
the
border
in
vermont,
on
vermont
shores,
that's
where
the
injury
occurs,
i
think.
the
existence
of
the
bed
is
mainly,
almost
entirely
in
the
state
of
new
york,
but
is
in
vermont,
it's
the
citizen's
of
vermont
putatively
at
least
in
the
complaint,
where
vermont
sues
as
parent's
patria,
quasi
severan
capacity,
they
are
the
people
who
suffer.
the
impact
is
still
there
across
the
border
and
i
will
think
the
state
law
of
vermont
should
govern.
mr.
taggart
whipple
well
there
is
--
i
am
not
sure
what
case
you
are
suggesting
to
thinking
of
your
honor?
mr.
taggart
whipple
well,
if
the
case
is
dealing
with
the
apportionment
of
interstate
waters
and
particularly
with
another
state
contact,
then
i
think
it's
clear
--
mr.
taggart
whipple
alright
put
that
aside
then.
if
you
are
dealing
with
the
apportionment,
the
apportionment
of
interstate
waters,
then
it
seems
to
me
the
federal
common-law
would
govern,
but
here
you
are
dealing
with
an
environmental
concern
and
i
would
like
to
call
your
honor's
attention
again
to
the
provisions
of
the
several
water
pollution
control
act
that
were
mentioned
in
wyandotte,
where
the
congressional
policy
was
clearly
and
explicitly
stated
to
recognize,
preserve
and
protect
the
primary
responsibilities
and
the
rights
of
the
states
in
preventing
and
controlling
water
pollution.
mr.
taggart
whipple
no,
i
don't.
i've
thought
about
is
a
deal
and
i've
looked
to
some
of
your
decisions
and
you
talked
about
desilve
(ph)
yesterday
and
commissioner
against
stern
which
is
not
cited
in
our
brief
at
357
u.s,
this
court
stated
uniformity
is
not
always
a
policy
and
it
pointed
out
in
the
bankruptcy
act,
for
example,
the
validity
of
a
transfer
of
property
and
fraud
against
creditors
is
governed
by
the
laws
of
the
states
and
it
added
that
you
could
have
50
different
laws
governing.
i
don't
see
a
real
inconsistency.
i
will
admit
when
i
first
thought
about
this
case,
the
notion
of
a
uniform
federal
common
law
blanketing
all
the
rivers
in
the
country
seemed
appealing.
but
i
think
when
you
think
about
it
and
you
realize
that
what
this
court
would
be
doing,
would
be
evolving
a
new
federal
common
law
and
laying
a
tier
of
new
federal
common
law
of
nuisance
on
top
of
this
existing
state
law,
the
result
would
be
not
to
hinder
and
help
this
pressing
problem
to
pollution
that
rides
aback
of
the
country,
but
it
would
be
years
before
people
could
know
what
the
federal
common
law
of
nuisance
would
be.
mr.
taggart
whipple
yes
sir.
mr.
taggart
whipple
there
is.
mr.
taggart
whipple
diversity.
mr.
taggart
whipple
i
don't
think
it
is,
no
your
honor.
it's
a
straight
complaint
of
nuisance
than
it
picks
up
in
parts,
for
most
of
the
complaint
is
on
file
here.
i
would
like
to
add
one
thing.
--
mr.
taggart
whipple
the
case
was
brought
shortly
after
this
one.
it's
a
class
action.
we
contested
the
class
action
--
mr.
taggart
whipple
john
and
three
other
plaintiffs
are
landowners
or
lessees
along
the
eastern
shore
of
the
lake,
opposite
the
sludge
bed
and
the
class
they
can
contend,
they
represent,
can
i
finish
my
sentence,
consists
of
the
class
along
the
lake
in
this
county,
it's
a
class
of
200,
new
york's
brief
is
mistaken,
he
says
600.
we
contested
the
class
action
before
the
district
judge
in
vermont,
he
agreed
with
us.
the
case
is
now
on
appeal
under
a
1292
(b)
certification
to
the
second
circuit,
that
is
the
status
of
the
case.
mr.
taggart
whipple
exactly,
yes,
thank
you.
mr.
taggart
whipple
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
international
paper
company.
our
position
in
this
litigation
is,
i'll
say
at
the
outset
three-fold.
we
agree
with
vermont
that
the
complaint
does
not
state
a
real
justiciable
claim
against
the
state
of
new
york.
secondly,
that
this
court
should
refuse
to
exercise
jurisdiction
as
it
did
in
wyandotte.
thirdly,
that
as
far
as
governing
law
goes,
the
governing
law
in
the
state
of
vermont's
claim
against
new
york
is
federal
law,
but
as
far
as
vermont's
claim
against
the
international
paper
company
goes
it
should
be
state
law.
before
i
get
into
the
law,
i'd
like
to
perhaps
amplify
startly
on
some
of
the
factual
questions
that
were
asked
this
morning.
with
respect
to
your
question
mr.
chief
justice
about
the
area
involved
and
so
on,
i
visited
the
area,
or
i
tramped
through
the
two
mills,
one
of
which
is
closed,
the
new
mill
which
is
now
open.
i
think
you
should
try
to
visualize
this
part
of
the
lake
as
a
very
narrow,
almost
like
the
closing
mouth
of
the
funnel.
you
fly
over
the
latter
part
of
the
lake,
you'll
see
that
latter
part
of
the
lake,
including
ticonderoga
and
crown
point
is
mudding
throughout
as
the
lake
broadens
and
gets
to
be
clear
and
much
different.
the
sludge
bed
itself
which
lies
in
the
northern
ticonderoga
creek
which
empties
into
lake
champlain
covers
some
300
acres.
some
of
it
is
covered
by
marsh
grass.
in
fact
it
amused
me
when
i
was
there
to
see
that
one
of
the
colored
postcards
that's
sold
at
port
ticonderoga
shows
the
view
over
the
sludge
bed
so
there
is
no
aesthetically
difficult
proposition
here.
the
area
involved
in
contrast
to
the
whole
area
of
lake
champlain
is
a
very
limited
area
indeed.
finally,
mr.
justice
stewart
and
i
believe
mr.
justice
blackmun
talked
about
the
new
mill,
i'd
like
to
say
a
word
about
that.
the
paper
company
has
long
been
concerned
about
the
discharge
problem
in
the
old
mill.
over
five
years
ago,
it
planned
this
new
mill,
it
cost
$76
million.
it
contains
the
most
modern
water
treatment
facilities
that
were
available,
which
cost
between
$3-4
million,
and
as
the
state
of
vermont
said
this
morning
there
is
no
problem
about
the
discharges
from
that
mill.
in
fact,
you
can
drink
the
water
when
it
comes
out
of
those
treatment
facilities,
and
people
have
done
it.
as
to
fish
life,
which
is
a
legitimate
ecological
concern,
we
disagree
with
the
statement
this
morning
by
mr.
parker
that
while
fish
life
was
improved
substantially
since
the
discharge
has
stopped
from
the
old
mill,
as
they
did
completely
in
april
1971
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
reversion
to
a
minor
and
poor
fish
life.
in
fact,
it's
not
true
as
i
understand
it
that
conditions
this
summer,
when
the
tests
were
conducted
by
a
firm
(inaudible)
favorable.
the
temperature
of
the
water
rose
to
high
level
soon
than
it
normally
did
and
stayed
there
for
a
longer
time.
i
want
to
emphasize
what
mr.
weinberg
said.
there
is
a
long
standing
dispute
as
to
the
best
way
to
deal
with
this
bed.
mr.
chief
justice
you've
mentioned
the
possibility
of
recovering
it.
there
are
at
least
three
possibilities,
one
is
to
leave
it
where
it
is,
covered
it
or
not
in
some
way;
the
second
is
to
remove
it
and
if
you
remove
it,
what
happens?
i
want
you
to
visualize
this
bed
as
a
light
and
feathery
substance
as
mr.
dime
(ph)
stated
and
mr.
wrickleshouse
(ph)
had
tested
in
the
new
york
state
supplement
brief
points
out.
it's
not
a
thick
heavy
bed.
any
attempt
to
dredge
and
remove
this
operation,
we
are
told
would
destroy
the
ecological
balance
of
the
lake
in
a
most
harmful
fashion
indeed
and
there
is
a
--
there
is
another
question
too.
if
you
remove
it,
where
do
you
put
it
and
what
happens?
certainly
it
would
have
to
be
removed
some
place
fairly
near
to
lake,
and
if
it
were
done
the
best
evidence
from
the
scientist
says
that
a
lot
of
it
will
reach
back
into
the
lake
so
removal
does
not
seem
to
be
a
realistic
alternative.
now
as
to
the
law,
i
don't
need
to
add
anything.
i
think
that
mr.
weinberg's
position,
which
is
basically
that
the
complaining
states
of
course
have
actions
for
maladministration
against
new
york
of
its
own
laws.
however,
as
to
whether
this
court
should
exercise
the
jurisdiction,
and
we
don't
dispute
the
court
as
jurisdiction,
we
contend
that
reasons
of
policy
and
principle
militate
against
the
exercise
of
the
court's
jurisdiction.
even
insofar
as
vermont's
claim
against
new
york
is
concerned,
a
state
against
state
claim,
the
way
the
law
has
developed
as
we
understand
it,
even
though
the
jurisdiction
which
has
given
to
this
court
of
state
against
state
cases
is
exclusive,
it
is
not
mandatory.
in
many
cases,
this
court
has
refused
to
exercise
jurisdiction
for
strong
and
compelling
reasons
of
policy.
in
wyandotte,
while
that
was
a
state
against
citizen
case,
and
obviously
we're
distinct
here
in
the
sense
that
new
york
as
a
party
as
well
as
the
paper
company,
we
contend
that
the
same
considerations
which
militated
against
the
exercise
of
this
court's
jurisdiction
in
wyandotte
should
lead
this
court
to
refuse
to
exercise
jurisdiction
here.
these
factors
are
familiar,
but
i
would
like
to
just
recite
them
and
let
them
into
the
facts
of
our
case.
in
wyandotte,
the
court
pointed
out
that
the
court
would
be
punished
into
a
morass
of
novel,
difficult
scientific,
technical
problems.
the
existence
and
the
manner
of
treating
this
sledge
bed
so
far
as
we
know
are
entirely
novel.
that
is
why
we
tried
to
get
the
best
engineering
experts
we
could
last
summer
to
look
at
it,
and
would
advise
us,
then
advise
the
state
of
new
york
as
what
ought
to
be
done
about
it.
the
mere
differences
to
come
up
this
morning
between
mr.
parker's
statement,
mr.
weinberg's
illustrate
and
underline
the
difficulties
of
these
problems.
i
think
it's
beyond
any
argument
that
if
this
court
would
have
take
the
case,
the
master
would
be
plunged
in
to
a
extremely
difficult
problem
of
fact
finding
and
recommending.
i
don't
think
it's
any
answer
as
vermont
might
suggest
later
on
on
to
say
a
master
can
do
it
all
because
as
we
understand
it
even
after
the
master
does
it,
as
mr.
justice
stone
pointed
out
in
georgia
against
pennsylvania,
there
still
remains
in
this
court,
the
duty
of
independently
examining
the
evidence
itself.
moreover,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
court
would
be
entering
into
an
area
that
congress
has
expressly
refused
to
preempt
and
rather
has
left
to
the
states.
the
policy
of
course,
we
think
would
be
great
if
this
court
would
have
withdrawn
of
into
the
morass
of
tort
litigation
arising
from
water
pollution
at
the
expense
of
its
ability
to
deal
with
the
ever
broadening
range
of
problems
that
come
before
this
court
in
massive
numbers
and
are
federally
oriented.
if
you
were
to
take
this
case,
it's
difficult
for
us
to
see
how
you
can
pick
and
choose
between
other
pollution
cases
which
would
be
sure
to
come
here
and
with
the
environmental
concerns
that
surround
the
countries
(inaudible)
now
we
think
inevitable
they
would
come
here.
we
therefore
suggest
this
case
should
be
resolved
at
the
lower
level.
we
suggest
that
the
proper
course
of
action
is
for
the
court
to
refuse
to
take
this
case
and
to
remit
vermont
to
the
type
of
procedure
that
the
court
has
said
again
and
again
should
prevail
in
these
matters
and
that
is
conference,
concessions,
cooperation
at
the
lower
level
where
these
things
could
and
should
be
resolved.
mr.
taggart
whipple
yes
sir.
mr.
taggart
whipple
we
contend
your
honor,
i
was
just
about
to
get
to
that,
that
we
are
sueable
in
vermont,
we
are
sueable
in
new
york,
we
are
ready
to
stand
sued
there,
there
is
no
question
about
that.
this
is
the
really
available
alternative
that
the
state
of
vermont
has
against
us
insofar
as
remedy
goes,
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
and
i'll
put
it
to
one
side,
but
i
want
to
just
advert
to
it,
in
a
word,
the
availability
of
the
administrative
remedies,
which
we
contend
vermont
has
failed
to
exhaust
and
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
respectfully,
that
in
deciding
whether
the
exercise,
the
court's
discretion
take
a
case
of
this
nature
one
should
look
long
and
hard
to
the
question
as
to
whether
the
state
that
brings
the
case
or
seeks
to
bring
the
case
here
has
in
fact
exhausted
it's
administrative
remedies
in
the
circumstances.
mr.
taggart
whipple
well,
i
don't
know.
i
would
characterize
it
as
an
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
think
you
could
call
it
primary
jurisdiction
too,
it
might
be
both,
it
might
well.
but
my
point
here
is,
i
don't
think
that
the
state
should
come
in
here
and
call
upon
the
really
extraordinary
remedy
of
original
jurisdiction,
which
this
court
has
said
time
and
again,
should
be
sparingly
exercised
and
only
in
unusual
circumstances
when
it
is
refused
as
the
state
of
vermont
refused
in
the
fall
of
1972
to
proceed
with
this
engineering
study
which
mr.
weinberg
will
leave
with
the
court.
the
door
was
slammed
and
it
seems
to
me
in
a
novel
for
a
state
to
stand
before
this
court
and
try
to
invoke
the
original
jurisdiction,
which
should
be
sparingly
exercised
and
which
when
it's
been
called
into
play
and
water
pollution
cases
has
raised
a
host
of
difficulties.
mr.
justice
holmes
spoke
about
this
as
early
as
1900,
72
years
ago
and
it
certainly
not
any
easy
today
than
it
was
then.
so,
i
would
suggest
that
an
element
and
a
strong
element
in
this
court's
discretion
should
be
not
only
the
availability
of
an
alternative
litigating
board
and
we
are
subject
to
suits
in
vermont.
we
never
questioned,
and
also
in
new
york,
but
also
whether
the
state
has
made
a
positive
and
a
genuine
effort
to
exhaust
their
administrative
remedies
and
i
contrast
this
case
against
some
other
cases
argued
here
this
morning.
i
think
there's
every
difference
in
the
will.
mr.
taggart
whipple
yes
sir.
mr.
taggart
whipple
i
would
think
the
state
of
vermont
law.
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
taggart
whipple
i
would
think
so,
i
think
common
law
governs
traditional
nuisance.
it's
one
of
the
oldest
types
of
complaint
known
to
mankind.
i
would
think
this
--
mr.
taggart
whipple
let
me
clarify
one
thing,
may
i?
you
said
that
if
we
are
sued
in
vermont,
the
same
thing.
i
think
probably,
the
law
of
the
place
of
injury
should
govern.
mr.
taggart
whipple
well,
i
find
it
hard
to
accept
that
hypothesis,
but
i
will
arguendo,
if
we
are
sued
in
new
york,
i
would
think
that
the
new
york
court
would
look
to
the
vermont
law
because
that's
the
place
where
their
injury
occurred.
mr.
taggart
whipple
no,
but
the
thrust
of
the
injury,
the
harm
visits
itself
across
the
border
in
vermont,
on
vermont
shores,
that's
where
the
injury
occurs,
i
think.
the
existence
of
the
bed
is
mainly,
almost
entirely
in
the
state
of
new
york,
but
is
in
vermont,
it's
the
citizen's
of
vermont
putatively
at
least
in
the
complaint,
where
vermont
sues
as
parent's
patria,
quasi
severan
capacity,
they
are
the
people
who
suffer.
the
impact
is
still
there
across
the
border
and
i
will
think
the
state
law
of
vermont
should
govern.
mr.
taggart
whipple
well
there
is
--
i
am
not
sure
what
case
you
are
suggesting
to
thinking
of
your
honor?
mr.
taggart
whipple
well,
if
the
case
is
dealing
with
the
apportionment
of
interstate
waters
and
particularly
with
another
state
contact,
then
i
think
it's
clear
--
mr.
taggart
whipple
alright
put
that
aside
then.
if
you
are
dealing
with
the
apportionment,
the
apportionment
of
interstate
waters,
then
it
seems
to
me
the
federal
common-law
would
govern,
but
here
you
are
dealing
with
an
environmental
concern
and
i
would
like
to
call
your
honor's
attention
again
to
the
provisions
of
the
several
water
pollution
control
act
that
were
mentioned
in
wyandotte,
where
the
congressional
policy
was
clearly
and
explicitly
stated
to
recognize,
preserve
and
protect
the
primary
responsibilities
and
the
rights
of
the
states
in
preventing
and
controlling
water
pollution.
mr.
taggart
whipple
no,
i
don't.
i've
thought
about
is
a
deal
and
i've
looked
to
some
of
your
decisions
and
you
talked
about
desilve
(ph)
yesterday
and
commissioner
against
stern
which
is
not
cited
in
our
brief
at
357
u.s,
this
court
stated
uniformity
is
not
always
a
policy
and
it
pointed
out
in
the
bankruptcy
act,
for
example,
the
validity
of
a
transfer
of
property
and
fraud
against
creditors
is
governed
by
the
laws
of
the
states
and
it
added
that
you
could
have
50
different
laws
governing.
i
don't
see
a
real
inconsistency.
i
will
admit
when
i
first
thought
about
this
case,
the
notion
of
a
uniform
federal
common
law
blanketing
all
the
rivers
in
the
country
seemed
appealing.
but
i
think
when
you
think
about
it
and
you
realize
that
what
this
court
would
be
doing,
would
be
evolving
a
new
federal
common
law
and
laying
a
tier
of
new
federal
common
law
of
nuisance
on
top
of
this
existing
state
law,
the
result
would
be
not
to
hinder
and
help
this
pressing
problem
to
pollution
that
rides
aback
of
the
country,
but
it
would
be
years
before
people
could
know
what
the
federal
common
law
of
nuisance
would
be.
mr.
taggart
whipple
yes
sir.
mr.
taggart
whipple
there
is.
mr.
taggart
whipple
diversity.
mr.
taggart
whipple
i
don't
think
it
is,
no
your
honor.
it's
a
straight
complaint
of
nuisance
than
it
picks
up
in
parts,
for
most
of
the
complaint
is
on
file
here.
i
would
like
to
add
one
thing.
--
mr.
taggart
whipple
the
case
was
brought
shortly
after
this
one.
it's
a
class
action.
we
contested
the
class
action
--
mr.
taggart
whipple
john
and
three
other
plaintiffs
are
landowners
or
lessees
along
the
eastern
shore
of
the
lake,
opposite
the
sludge
bed
and
the
class
they
can
contend,
they
represent,
can
i
finish
my
sentence,
consists
of
the
class
along
the
lake
in
this
county,
it's
a
class
of
200,
new
york's
brief
is
mistaken,
he
says
600.
we
contested
the
class
action
before
the
district
judge
in
vermont,
he
agreed
with
us.
the
case
is
now
on
appeal
under
a
1292
(b)
certification
to
the
second
circuit,
that
is
the
status
of
the
case.
mr.
taggart
whipple
exactly,
yes,
thank
you.
