mr.
fred
i.
parker
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
original
jurisdiction
suit
is
a
suit
by
the
state
of
vermont
against
the
neighboring
state
of
new
york
and
against
a
citizen
of
that
state,
namely
international
paper
company.
it
is
a
controversy
over
a
sludge
bed
which
is
sitting
on
the
bottom
of
lake
champlain
which
lies
over
the
interstate
boundary
between
the
two
states.
we
have
alleged
in
our
bill
of
complaint
that,
that
sludge
bed
constitutes
a
public
nuisance
that
it
also
constitutes
a
continuing
trespass
because
it
is
encroached
over
the
state
line
on
to
lands
for
the
state
of
vermont,
that
it
is
giving
rise
to
an
interstate
boundary
question
because
its
presence
is
causing
a
shift
of
the
channel
in
the
direction
of
the
state
of
vermont
and
that
it
is
depriving,
and
has
deprived,
vermont
citizens
of
their
right
to
freely
use
lake
champlain.
it
is
my
intension
to
spend
some
portion
of
the
original
part
of
this
argument
in
discussing
of
facts
which
i
think
are
very
important
and
a
very
short
time
on
the
legal
issues
which
i
think
are
simple
to
comprehend,
although
they
might
be
difficult
to
administer.
the
states
of
vermont
and
new
york,
as
i
said,
are
neighboring
states.
lake
champlain
lies
along
the
boundary
between
the
two
states.
it
is
a
170-mile
long
lake,
a
very
narrow
one,
12
miles
wide
at
its
widest
point
and
it
flows
in
a
northerly
direction.
the
situation
that
we
describe,
the
sludge
bed
situation,
is
one
which
exists
in
the
southerly
portion
of
the
lake,
almost
at
what
would
be
the
head
waters,
if
you
are
viewing
this
long
lake
as
a
stream.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
yes
your
honor
it
--
the
length
is
107
miles
long,
12
miles
at
its
widest
part
which
is
about
the
midpoint
of
that
107-mile
stretch
and
it
narrows
down
in
the
southerly
portion
at
the
place,
we're
describing
to
about
a
mile
and
it
narrows
down
in
the
northerly
portion
where
it
joins
the
--
it
crosses
the
canadian
boarder
to
about
a
mile
and
i
would
say
that
it
fairly
regularly
narrows.
that
is,
it
starts
about
a
mile
wide
expands
to
12
miles
and
then
comes
back
to
about
a
mile
wide.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
the
evidence
that
was
presented
in
the
interstate
conference
that
was
held
on
this
matter
indicated
that
the
sludge
bed
itself
was
approximately
300
acres
and
that
the
water
that
it
then
affected
was
about
1600
acres.
now
at
that
time,
there
was
a
continuing
discharge
from
the
international
paper
company
plant
which
has
since
ceased
and
i
expect
that
now
the
water
is
being
affected
somewhat
less
than
they
were
at
that
time
because
of
the
discontinuance
of
the
discharge.
at
the
place
where
the
sludge
bed
exists,
there
is
a
stream
which
is
coming
from
new
york,
ticonderoga
creek
which
runs
between
lake
george
and
runs
into
lake
champlain,
and
that
stream,
while
the
lake
is
running
in
a
north-south
direction,
the
water
flowing
northerly,
the
stream
joins
the
lake
in
a
south-easterly
direction,
so
that
the
waters
of
the
stream
run
into
the
lake
and
buck
the
current
that
exists
there
in
the
lake
and
as
a
result
of
that
the
--
well
let
me
back
up
for
just
a
second,
the
international
paper
company
has
been
operating
a
mill,
a
paper
producing
mill
and
pulp
mill
on
ticonderoga
creek
for
a
period
of
45
years
and
it
has
discharged
waste
from
those
paper
making
operations
for
that
period
into
the
stream.
the
discharges
have
deposited
out
along
the
stream
and
especially
at
the
place
where
the
stream
joins
the
lake,
is
such
a
point
that
it
has
formed
this
huge
300
acre
sludge
bed
which
consists
of
organic
and
inorganic
materials
that
are
in
a
state
of
septic
decay.
and
that
--
mr.
fred
i.
parker
yes
your
honor,
it
has.
it
shut
down
partially
in
december
of
1970
after
this
suit
was
instituted
and
fully
shut
down
in
april
of
1971,
but
the
--
mr.
fred
i.
parker
that's
correct.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
new
plant
is
on
the
lake
and
it
contains
a
treatment
system.
at
this
point
in
time,
we
haven't
seen
measurable
degrading
effect
from
the
new
plant
although
we
are
monitoring
that
situation.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
situation
that
does
exist
--
mr.
fred
i.
parker
yes,
it
discharges
a
treated
effluent
from
the
plant.
both
the
domestic
sewage
in
the
plant
and
the
waste
from
the
paper
making
operation
are
treated
and
an
effluent
is
discharged.
we
do
see
some
discoloration,
but
so
far
we
haven't
measured
detrimental
effects.
the
sludge
bed
however,
remains
on
the
bottom
of
the
lake
and
it
is
sitting
on
land
of
the
state
of
new
york.
we
believe
that
that
sludge
bed
constitutes
a
continuing
nuisance
in
that,
it
will
continue
to
decay
and
take
oxygen
from
the
waters.
it
will
continue
in
it's
decay
to
give
off
gaseous
emissions
causing
severe
smell
in
that
area.
it
will
continue
to
constitute
a
interference
with
navigation.
the
situation
is
there
that
the
sludge
has
actually
filled
in
to
depths
of
12
feet
to
a
point
at
low
water.
in
much
of
that
area,
you
can't
bring
a
boat
through
there
and
the
situation
has
existed
for
many
years
that
as
this
sludge
bed
decays,
the
gases
formed
in
the
sludge
bed
cause
huge
mats
of
the
sludge
to
rise
to
the
surface
and
the
prevailing
westerly
winds
cause
them
to
float
on
the
water
to
the
vermont
shore.
we
believe
that
this
condition
will
continue.
we
also
believe
that
there
will
be
a
continuing
trespass.
we
have
measured
using
older
maps
that
show
the
midpoint
of
the
deepest
channel
in
the
lake
which
constitutes
the
boundary.
we
find
that,
that
deep
channel
has
been
filled
in
such
that
the
deepest
channel
now
has
moved
toward
the
vermont
shore
and
that
the
sludge
sitting
there
constitutes
a
trespass
and
in
addition,
it
gives
rise
to
a
question
of
where
boundary
will
be.
the
existence
of
that
sludge
bed
over
the
years
and
it's
continued
existence
in
the
water
deprives
vermont
citizens
of
their
right
to
fish
in
the
water,
the
fish
life
there
has
been
seriously
depleted
by
virtue
of
the
oxygen
robbing
qualities
of
the
sludge
and
--
mr.
fred
i.
parker
it's
admitted
in
part
and
denied
in
part.
i
think
that
the
posture
of
--
i
don't
mean
to
speak
for
the
defendants.
i
think
the
defendant
posture
at
this
point
is
that
the
continuing
effect
of
the
sludge
bed
will
have
no
detrimental
effect
as
i
understand
their
position.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
as
i
understand
it,
the
studies
of
the
defendants
in
this
case
indicate
that
the
conditions
in
that
area
have
improved
and
our
own
studies
indicate
that
the
conditions
have
improved
greatly,
since
the
discharge
is
ceased.
but
our
experts
inform
us
that
we
can
expect
a
continuation
of
the
prior
circumstances,
based
on
that
fact
that
the
recent
studies
were
done,
were
done
last
summer
at
a
time
when
the
water
was
unusually
high
down
there
and
the
temperatures
did
not
rise
as
much
as
they
have
in
past.
we
expect
that
given
a
situation
where
the
water
is
lower
and
get
heated
up
as
it
has
in
past
years
that
we
will
return
to
the
situation
that
existed
over
past
years
and
probably
not
as
severe
because
of
the
discontinuance
of
the
discharges.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
if
it
turns
out
in
the
proof
of
this
case
that
the
remedy,
the
best
remedy
is
removal
of
the
sludge,
then
of
course
we
may
end
up
with
incomplete
relief
because
new
york
is
now
taking
the
position
that
to
remove
the
sludge
would
constitute
a
threat
to
the
ecology
of
the
lake.
new
york
has
control
over
those
waters
and
new
york
owns
that
land.
i
assume
that
new
york
could
prevent
international
paper
company
from
removing
the
sludge
from
its
land
and
--
mr.
fred
i.
parker
no,
we
didn't
get
that
far.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
we
got
through
two
conferences
and
a
letter
from
the
secretary
of
the
interior
suggesting
action
on
the
part
of
state
of
new
york,
then
the,
then
secretary
of
interior
hickel
left
and
the
powers
of
the
interior
were
transferred
to
epa
and
we
have
requested
action
from
epa,
but
their
response
has
been
negative
at
this
point.
we
haven't
seen
any
action.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
we
invited
them
to
join
this
suit
and
they
said,
they
are
very
concerned
about
it,
but
didn't
care
to
act
at
this
point
and
i
understand
that
they
are
--
attached
to
the
latest
brief
of
the
state
of
new
york
is
a
indication
that
the
state
has
corresponded
with
epa
indicating
that
their
recent
study
show
that
nothing
further
should
be
done.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
that's
correct
john.
that's
--
mr.
fred
i.
parker
that's
right,
that's
the
frustrating
business
of
attempting
to
deal
through
these
conferences
with
federal
government.
we
have
no
way
of
getting
them
to
act,
if
they
don't
care
to.
and
i
have
no
way
of
knowing
whether
the
federal
government
disagrees
with
our
position
or
for
some
other
reason
has
declined
the
act,
but
they
have
not
gone
fully.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
we
feel
that
that
sludge
either
should
be
removed
from
the
water
or
should
be
covered
over
so
that
the
it
doesn't
affect
the
water
quality
in
the
future.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
i
am
not
sure
that
record
shows
this,
but
the
federal
conferences
that
were
held
in
this
case,
the
corp
of
engineers
did
the
study
which
suggested
that
a
sand
cover
could
be
laid
over
sludge.
there
is
an
disadvantage
in
that
remedy
because
we
already
have
a
problem
with
navigation
which
of
course
wouldn't
be
solved
by
leaving
sludge
there.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
i
think
that's
one
possibility
is
accommodation
of
the
two
remedies
to
dredge
some
and
to
cover
some,
but
i
think
that
if
this
court
does
take
jurisdiction,
also
it
would
be
one
of
the
problems
that
we
would
be
trying
to
workout
in
trying
this
case.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
please
the
court.
i
indicated
just
prior
recess
that
we're
seeking
as
remedies
in
this
case
either
the
removal
of
the
sludge
bed
or
its
covering
whichever
seemed
most
appropriate
at
the
time
when
the
remedy
that
when
we
would
receive
a
remedy
and
in
addition,
i
should
indicate
that
we
do
have
a
claim
in
this
bill
of
complaint
for
money
damages.
we
have
sought
over
the
years
alternative
relief
to
litigation.
early
in
the
1960s
in
the
new
england
interstate
water
pollution
control
compact,
the
state
of
vermont
began
negotiations
which
lasted
over
a
period
of
10
years
with
the
state
of
new
york,
seeking
some
remedy
of
the
situation
which
existed
in
the
lake
champlain.
and
as
i
recited
earlier
under
the
federal
water
quality
act,
we
have
--
there
have
been
held
two
federal
conferences
at
the
request
of
the
state
of
vermont.
in
the
first
conference,
held
in
1968,
it
was
determined
that
there
was
a
problem
in
that
area
of
the
lake.
and
in
between
the
two
conferences
studies
were
conducted
by
the
army
corp
of
engineers
and
by
the
water
quality
administration
which
studies
dealt
with
the
question
of
how
best
to
remedy
the
situation?
one
of
them
concluded
that
a
major
portion
of
the
sludge
bed
did
come
from
the
international
paper
company
plant.
the
other
studies
concluded
that
the
best
remedy
was
cessation
of
a
discharge
and
removal
of
the
sludge
and
a
technical
committee
of
that
conference
concluded
that
the
continued
existence
of
the
sludge
bed
in
the
lake
would
constitute
a
continuing
problem.
the
defendants
of
course
disagree
with
that
conclusion
and
that
points
up
the
reason
why
we
have
have
to
litigate
this
case.
legal
issues
involved
as
we
see
them,
the
primary
legal
issue
is
whether
--
mr.
fred
i.
parker
it
is
now
on
both
sides
of
the
boundary,
your
honor.
it
emanates
from
the
new
york
side
and
it
is
spilling
over
on
to
vermont
land.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
i
don't
think
that
we'll
be
able
to
prove
that
they
are
the
sole
cause,
but
they're
certainly
the
major
contributor
to
it
and
i
think
we
can
prove
that.
the
paper
company
alleges
that
others
are
also
involved,
but
they
don't
set
out
the
quantities.
the
federal
study
done
pursuant
to
the
first
conference
concluded
that
the
major
source
of
the
bed
were
from
the
paper
company
plant.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
that's
right.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
south
of
their
--
at
ticonderoga.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
its
just
pass
the
lake
and
yes
the
city
--
the
ticonderoga
boundary
does
have
a
plant
along
the
lake
but
the
city
of
ticonderoga
and
the
place
where
the
mill
is
on
ticonderoga
creek
which
is
a
tributary
running
into
lake
champlain.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
about
a
mile
i
believe.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
as
we
see
it
the
major
legal
issues
whether
jurisdiction
is
exclusive
in
this
court
and
contributing
to
that
issue
is
whether
we
have
an
alternative
forum
or
whether
the
principles
of
ohio
just
wind
out
(inaudible).
in
addition
there
is
the
legal
question
just
recently
briefed,
asked
by
the
court
as
to
what
law
applies?
we
think
all
of
those
legal
issues
turn
on
and
are
controlled
by
the
question
of
whether
new
york
is
properly
a
party
to
this
complaint.
the
defendant's
claim
that
we
are
simply
alleging
no
administration
of
new
york
law
in
failing
to
control
this
situation
over
the
years,
that
is
not
the
case.
if
we
were
to
assume
that
there
were
no
new
york
laws
on
this
subject,
we
would
still
have
a
situation
existing
where
the
sludge
bed
lies
on
new
york
land
and
new
york
has
control
over
that
land
and
over
that
situation.
they
are
permitting
and
have
permitted
over
the
years,
the
continuation
of
a
nuisance
which
is
causing
us
harm
and
we
think
that
once
that
question
is
resolved
then
the
others
fall
into
line.
jurisdiction
is
exclusive
one.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
maintenance
for
public
nuisance,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
that's
correct,
on
its
property.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
yes,
if
we
litigate
before
this
court,
it'll
be
a
question
of
federal
common
law
and
that's
the
position
that
we
took
in
the
recently
submitted
memorandum.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
i
don't
think
we
can
because
the
state
of
vermont
is
not
a
citizen
for
purposes
of
this
diversity
and
both
the
28
u.s.
code,
section
1251
provides
that
this
forum
is
the
exclusive
forum
where
we
can
litigate
state
versus
state.
so
as
long
as
new
york
is
a
party
for
this
litigation,
this
is
the
only
place
that
we
can
bring
the
suit.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
i
don't
think
--
as
i
understand
the
law
the
district
court
does
not
have
jurisdiction
to
permit
a
suit
between
states.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
yes,
your
honor.
we
are
dealing
in
this
joint
--
mr.
fred
i.
parker
yes,
your
honor
we
could.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
i
think
that
that's
a
problem.
if
we
conclude
that
state
versus
state,
we
look
to
federal
common
law
in
this
court
and
if
we
treat
those
as
a
case
of
joint
tortfeasors,
both
litigated
here,
then
i
think
that
this
court
would
apply
federal
common
law
against
both
defendants.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
at
that
point
then
the
substitute
law
which
controls
would
be
state
law.
the
choice
of
law
rules
would
have
to
apply.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
erie
railroad
v.
tompkins.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
i
was
just
--
i
think
it
would
have
to
be
a
diversity
case
in
order
to
get
there
and
that's
why
we
can't
go
there.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
in
cases
involving
state
versus
other
states,
the
court
has
consistently
held
that
these
kind
of
cases
are
governed
by
interstate
common
law
or
federal
common
law
of
nuisance.
in
suits
between
states
and
citizens
of
other
states,
when
a
state
was
not
involved,
to
me
the
law
was
unclear.
i
can't
find
any
clear
holding
--
mr.
fred
i.
parker
i
would
be,
yes.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
because
as
i
understand
it
--
well
the
only
way,
i
could
understand
to
get
into
a
federal
district
court
--
mr.
fred
i.
parker
i
had
never
understood
that
to
be
the
case.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
yes,
i
am
acquainted
with
it
your
honor.
i
don't
fully
understand
it.
it
seems
to
stand
alone
and
--
mr.
fred
i.
parker
i
think
if
i
were
plaintiff
in
that
suit
in
a
federal
court,
i
would
urge
that
was
a
case,
but
i
don't
find
that
to
be
the
law
at
this
point
in
time.
i
am
afraid
that
the
federal
district
court
wouldn't
let
you
litigate
and
therefore
you'd
be
without
a
forum.
you'd
end
up
in
a
state
court
--
mr.
fred
i.
parker
yes,
it
did
and
that's
the
only
one
so
far
as
i
know.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
no,
there
are
no
holding
--
mr.
fred
i.
parker
that's
correct.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
well
as
i
understand
wyandotte,
that
case
said,
go
back
to
the
state
court.
it
did
not
direct
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
to
go
to
the
federal
district
court.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
it's
possibly
the
case
and
we
may
have
that
here
in
this
case,
if
we
have
to.
if
this
court
does
not
take
jurisdiction,
we
may
very
well
end
up
back
in
a
state
court
in
vermont.
but
in
that
case,
we
would
only
be
against
international
paper
company
and
i
don't
believe
that
we
could
get
complete
relief,
and
that
is
my
argument.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
seems
clear
to
me
that
the
court
has
well
in
mind
the
issues
in
this
case
and
i
don't
have
anything
further
except
that
i
hate
to
leave
the
record
reflecting
the
new
york
allegations
of
diligence
and
for
suing
international
paper
company,
in
this
case.
the
discharges
in
the
lake
champlain
have
occurred
for
45
years
and
many,
many
years
there
were
no
suits,
whatsoever.
it
was
several
years
after
vermont
began
pushing
new
york
before
any
litigation
was
initiated
and
it's
notable
that
no
litigation
ever
sought
a
preliminary
injunction.
in
fact,
what
happened
in
each
case
was
that
international
paper
company
would
come
forward
with
its
schedule
as
to
abatement
and
new
york
would
agree
with
it
and
then
there
were
delays
and
there
were
numerous
changes
of
deadline
until
such
time
as
the
paper
company
finally
did
construct
and
began
operation
of
its
new
mill
at
which
point
the
question
of
the
lawsuit
became
moot.
unless
there
are
questions
i
have
further.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
original
jurisdiction
suit
is
a
suit
by
the
state
of
vermont
against
the
neighboring
state
of
new
york
and
against
a
citizen
of
that
state,
namely
international
paper
company.
it
is
a
controversy
over
a
sludge
bed
which
is
sitting
on
the
bottom
of
lake
champlain
which
lies
over
the
interstate
boundary
between
the
two
states.
we
have
alleged
in
our
bill
of
complaint
that,
that
sludge
bed
constitutes
a
public
nuisance
that
it
also
constitutes
a
continuing
trespass
because
it
is
encroached
over
the
state
line
on
to
lands
for
the
state
of
vermont,
that
it
is
giving
rise
to
an
interstate
boundary
question
because
its
presence
is
causing
a
shift
of
the
channel
in
the
direction
of
the
state
of
vermont
and
that
it
is
depriving,
and
has
deprived,
vermont
citizens
of
their
right
to
freely
use
lake
champlain.
it
is
my
intension
to
spend
some
portion
of
the
original
part
of
this
argument
in
discussing
of
facts
which
i
think
are
very
important
and
a
very
short
time
on
the
legal
issues
which
i
think
are
simple
to
comprehend,
although
they
might
be
difficult
to
administer.
the
states
of
vermont
and
new
york,
as
i
said,
are
neighboring
states.
lake
champlain
lies
along
the
boundary
between
the
two
states.
it
is
a
170-mile
long
lake,
a
very
narrow
one,
12
miles
wide
at
its
widest
point
and
it
flows
in
a
northerly
direction.
the
situation
that
we
describe,
the
sludge
bed
situation,
is
one
which
exists
in
the
southerly
portion
of
the
lake,
almost
at
what
would
be
the
head
waters,
if
you
are
viewing
this
long
lake
as
a
stream.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
yes
your
honor
it
--
the
length
is
107
miles
long,
12
miles
at
its
widest
part
which
is
about
the
midpoint
of
that
107-mile
stretch
and
it
narrows
down
in
the
southerly
portion
at
the
place,
we're
describing
to
about
a
mile
and
it
narrows
down
in
the
northerly
portion
where
it
joins
the
--
it
crosses
the
canadian
boarder
to
about
a
mile
and
i
would
say
that
it
fairly
regularly
narrows.
that
is,
it
starts
about
a
mile
wide
expands
to
12
miles
and
then
comes
back
to
about
a
mile
wide.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
the
evidence
that
was
presented
in
the
interstate
conference
that
was
held
on
this
matter
indicated
that
the
sludge
bed
itself
was
approximately
300
acres
and
that
the
water
that
it
then
affected
was
about
1600
acres.
now
at
that
time,
there
was
a
continuing
discharge
from
the
international
paper
company
plant
which
has
since
ceased
and
i
expect
that
now
the
water
is
being
affected
somewhat
less
than
they
were
at
that
time
because
of
the
discontinuance
of
the
discharge.
at
the
place
where
the
sludge
bed
exists,
there
is
a
stream
which
is
coming
from
new
york,
ticonderoga
creek
which
runs
between
lake
george
and
runs
into
lake
champlain,
and
that
stream,
while
the
lake
is
running
in
a
north-south
direction,
the
water
flowing
northerly,
the
stream
joins
the
lake
in
a
south-easterly
direction,
so
that
the
waters
of
the
stream
run
into
the
lake
and
buck
the
current
that
exists
there
in
the
lake
and
as
a
result
of
that
the
--
well
let
me
back
up
for
just
a
second,
the
international
paper
company
has
been
operating
a
mill,
a
paper
producing
mill
and
pulp
mill
on
ticonderoga
creek
for
a
period
of
45
years
and
it
has
discharged
waste
from
those
paper
making
operations
for
that
period
into
the
stream.
the
discharges
have
deposited
out
along
the
stream
and
especially
at
the
place
where
the
stream
joins
the
lake,
is
such
a
point
that
it
has
formed
this
huge
300
acre
sludge
bed
which
consists
of
organic
and
inorganic
materials
that
are
in
a
state
of
septic
decay.
and
that
--
mr.
fred
i.
parker
yes
your
honor,
it
has.
it
shut
down
partially
in
december
of
1970
after
this
suit
was
instituted
and
fully
shut
down
in
april
of
1971,
but
the
--
mr.
fred
i.
parker
that's
correct.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
new
plant
is
on
the
lake
and
it
contains
a
treatment
system.
at
this
point
in
time,
we
haven't
seen
measurable
degrading
effect
from
the
new
plant
although
we
are
monitoring
that
situation.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
situation
that
does
exist
--
mr.
fred
i.
parker
yes,
it
discharges
a
treated
effluent
from
the
plant.
both
the
domestic
sewage
in
the
plant
and
the
waste
from
the
paper
making
operation
are
treated
and
an
effluent
is
discharged.
we
do
see
some
discoloration,
but
so
far
we
haven't
measured
detrimental
effects.
the
sludge
bed
however,
remains
on
the
bottom
of
the
lake
and
it
is
sitting
on
land
of
the
state
of
new
york.
we
believe
that
that
sludge
bed
constitutes
a
continuing
nuisance
in
that,
it
will
continue
to
decay
and
take
oxygen
from
the
waters.
it
will
continue
in
it's
decay
to
give
off
gaseous
emissions
causing
severe
smell
in
that
area.
it
will
continue
to
constitute
a
interference
with
navigation.
the
situation
is
there
that
the
sludge
has
actually
filled
in
to
depths
of
12
feet
to
a
point
at
low
water.
in
much
of
that
area,
you
can't
bring
a
boat
through
there
and
the
situation
has
existed
for
many
years
that
as
this
sludge
bed
decays,
the
gases
formed
in
the
sludge
bed
cause
huge
mats
of
the
sludge
to
rise
to
the
surface
and
the
prevailing
westerly
winds
cause
them
to
float
on
the
water
to
the
vermont
shore.
we
believe
that
this
condition
will
continue.
we
also
believe
that
there
will
be
a
continuing
trespass.
we
have
measured
using
older
maps
that
show
the
midpoint
of
the
deepest
channel
in
the
lake
which
constitutes
the
boundary.
we
find
that,
that
deep
channel
has
been
filled
in
such
that
the
deepest
channel
now
has
moved
toward
the
vermont
shore
and
that
the
sludge
sitting
there
constitutes
a
trespass
and
in
addition,
it
gives
rise
to
a
question
of
where
boundary
will
be.
the
existence
of
that
sludge
bed
over
the
years
and
it's
continued
existence
in
the
water
deprives
vermont
citizens
of
their
right
to
fish
in
the
water,
the
fish
life
there
has
been
seriously
depleted
by
virtue
of
the
oxygen
robbing
qualities
of
the
sludge
and
--
mr.
fred
i.
parker
it's
admitted
in
part
and
denied
in
part.
i
think
that
the
posture
of
--
i
don't
mean
to
speak
for
the
defendants.
i
think
the
defendant
posture
at
this
point
is
that
the
continuing
effect
of
the
sludge
bed
will
have
no
detrimental
effect
as
i
understand
their
position.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
as
i
understand
it,
the
studies
of
the
defendants
in
this
case
indicate
that
the
conditions
in
that
area
have
improved
and
our
own
studies
indicate
that
the
conditions
have
improved
greatly,
since
the
discharge
is
ceased.
but
our
experts
inform
us
that
we
can
expect
a
continuation
of
the
prior
circumstances,
based
on
that
fact
that
the
recent
studies
were
done,
were
done
last
summer
at
a
time
when
the
water
was
unusually
high
down
there
and
the
temperatures
did
not
rise
as
much
as
they
have
in
past.
we
expect
that
given
a
situation
where
the
water
is
lower
and
get
heated
up
as
it
has
in
past
years
that
we
will
return
to
the
situation
that
existed
over
past
years
and
probably
not
as
severe
because
of
the
discontinuance
of
the
discharges.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
if
it
turns
out
in
the
proof
of
this
case
that
the
remedy,
the
best
remedy
is
removal
of
the
sludge,
then
of
course
we
may
end
up
with
incomplete
relief
because
new
york
is
now
taking
the
position
that
to
remove
the
sludge
would
constitute
a
threat
to
the
ecology
of
the
lake.
new
york
has
control
over
those
waters
and
new
york
owns
that
land.
i
assume
that
new
york
could
prevent
international
paper
company
from
removing
the
sludge
from
its
land
and
--
mr.
fred
i.
parker
no,
we
didn't
get
that
far.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
we
got
through
two
conferences
and
a
letter
from
the
secretary
of
the
interior
suggesting
action
on
the
part
of
state
of
new
york,
then
the,
then
secretary
of
interior
hickel
left
and
the
powers
of
the
interior
were
transferred
to
epa
and
we
have
requested
action
from
epa,
but
their
response
has
been
negative
at
this
point.
we
haven't
seen
any
action.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
we
invited
them
to
join
this
suit
and
they
said,
they
are
very
concerned
about
it,
but
didn't
care
to
act
at
this
point
and
i
understand
that
they
are
--
attached
to
the
latest
brief
of
the
state
of
new
york
is
a
indication
that
the
state
has
corresponded
with
epa
indicating
that
their
recent
study
show
that
nothing
further
should
be
done.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
that's
correct
john.
that's
--
mr.
fred
i.
parker
that's
right,
that's
the
frustrating
business
of
attempting
to
deal
through
these
conferences
with
federal
government.
we
have
no
way
of
getting
them
to
act,
if
they
don't
care
to.
and
i
have
no
way
of
knowing
whether
the
federal
government
disagrees
with
our
position
or
for
some
other
reason
has
declined
the
act,
but
they
have
not
gone
fully.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
we
feel
that
that
sludge
either
should
be
removed
from
the
water
or
should
be
covered
over
so
that
the
it
doesn't
affect
the
water
quality
in
the
future.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
i
am
not
sure
that
record
shows
this,
but
the
federal
conferences
that
were
held
in
this
case,
the
corp
of
engineers
did
the
study
which
suggested
that
a
sand
cover
could
be
laid
over
sludge.
there
is
an
disadvantage
in
that
remedy
because
we
already
have
a
problem
with
navigation
which
of
course
wouldn't
be
solved
by
leaving
sludge
there.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
i
think
that's
one
possibility
is
accommodation
of
the
two
remedies
to
dredge
some
and
to
cover
some,
but
i
think
that
if
this
court
does
take
jurisdiction,
also
it
would
be
one
of
the
problems
that
we
would
be
trying
to
workout
in
trying
this
case.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
please
the
court.
i
indicated
just
prior
recess
that
we're
seeking
as
remedies
in
this
case
either
the
removal
of
the
sludge
bed
or
its
covering
whichever
seemed
most
appropriate
at
the
time
when
the
remedy
that
when
we
would
receive
a
remedy
and
in
addition,
i
should
indicate
that
we
do
have
a
claim
in
this
bill
of
complaint
for
money
damages.
we
have
sought
over
the
years
alternative
relief
to
litigation.
early
in
the
1960s
in
the
new
england
interstate
water
pollution
control
compact,
the
state
of
vermont
began
negotiations
which
lasted
over
a
period
of
10
years
with
the
state
of
new
york,
seeking
some
remedy
of
the
situation
which
existed
in
the
lake
champlain.
and
as
i
recited
earlier
under
the
federal
water
quality
act,
we
have
--
there
have
been
held
two
federal
conferences
at
the
request
of
the
state
of
vermont.
in
the
first
conference,
held
in
1968,
it
was
determined
that
there
was
a
problem
in
that
area
of
the
lake.
and
in
between
the
two
conferences
studies
were
conducted
by
the
army
corp
of
engineers
and
by
the
water
quality
administration
which
studies
dealt
with
the
question
of
how
best
to
remedy
the
situation?
one
of
them
concluded
that
a
major
portion
of
the
sludge
bed
did
come
from
the
international
paper
company
plant.
the
other
studies
concluded
that
the
best
remedy
was
cessation
of
a
discharge
and
removal
of
the
sludge
and
a
technical
committee
of
that
conference
concluded
that
the
continued
existence
of
the
sludge
bed
in
the
lake
would
constitute
a
continuing
problem.
the
defendants
of
course
disagree
with
that
conclusion
and
that
points
up
the
reason
why
we
have
have
to
litigate
this
case.
legal
issues
involved
as
we
see
them,
the
primary
legal
issue
is
whether
--
mr.
fred
i.
parker
it
is
now
on
both
sides
of
the
boundary,
your
honor.
it
emanates
from
the
new
york
side
and
it
is
spilling
over
on
to
vermont
land.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
i
don't
think
that
we'll
be
able
to
prove
that
they
are
the
sole
cause,
but
they're
certainly
the
major
contributor
to
it
and
i
think
we
can
prove
that.
the
paper
company
alleges
that
others
are
also
involved,
but
they
don't
set
out
the
quantities.
the
federal
study
done
pursuant
to
the
first
conference
concluded
that
the
major
source
of
the
bed
were
from
the
paper
company
plant.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
that's
right.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
south
of
their
--
at
ticonderoga.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
its
just
pass
the
lake
and
yes
the
city
--
the
ticonderoga
boundary
does
have
a
plant
along
the
lake
but
the
city
of
ticonderoga
and
the
place
where
the
mill
is
on
ticonderoga
creek
which
is
a
tributary
running
into
lake
champlain.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
about
a
mile
i
believe.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
as
we
see
it
the
major
legal
issues
whether
jurisdiction
is
exclusive
in
this
court
and
contributing
to
that
issue
is
whether
we
have
an
alternative
forum
or
whether
the
principles
of
ohio
just
wind
out
(inaudible).
in
addition
there
is
the
legal
question
just
recently
briefed,
asked
by
the
court
as
to
what
law
applies?
we
think
all
of
those
legal
issues
turn
on
and
are
controlled
by
the
question
of
whether
new
york
is
properly
a
party
to
this
complaint.
the
defendant's
claim
that
we
are
simply
alleging
no
administration
of
new
york
law
in
failing
to
control
this
situation
over
the
years,
that
is
not
the
case.
if
we
were
to
assume
that
there
were
no
new
york
laws
on
this
subject,
we
would
still
have
a
situation
existing
where
the
sludge
bed
lies
on
new
york
land
and
new
york
has
control
over
that
land
and
over
that
situation.
they
are
permitting
and
have
permitted
over
the
years,
the
continuation
of
a
nuisance
which
is
causing
us
harm
and
we
think
that
once
that
question
is
resolved
then
the
others
fall
into
line.
jurisdiction
is
exclusive
one.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
maintenance
for
public
nuisance,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
that's
correct,
on
its
property.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
yes,
if
we
litigate
before
this
court,
it'll
be
a
question
of
federal
common
law
and
that's
the
position
that
we
took
in
the
recently
submitted
memorandum.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
i
don't
think
we
can
because
the
state
of
vermont
is
not
a
citizen
for
purposes
of
this
diversity
and
both
the
28
u.s.
code,
section
1251
provides
that
this
forum
is
the
exclusive
forum
where
we
can
litigate
state
versus
state.
so
as
long
as
new
york
is
a
party
for
this
litigation,
this
is
the
only
place
that
we
can
bring
the
suit.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
i
don't
think
--
as
i
understand
the
law
the
district
court
does
not
have
jurisdiction
to
permit
a
suit
between
states.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
yes,
your
honor.
we
are
dealing
in
this
joint
--
mr.
fred
i.
parker
yes,
your
honor
we
could.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
i
think
that
that's
a
problem.
if
we
conclude
that
state
versus
state,
we
look
to
federal
common
law
in
this
court
and
if
we
treat
those
as
a
case
of
joint
tortfeasors,
both
litigated
here,
then
i
think
that
this
court
would
apply
federal
common
law
against
both
defendants.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
at
that
point
then
the
substitute
law
which
controls
would
be
state
law.
the
choice
of
law
rules
would
have
to
apply.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
erie
railroad
v.
tompkins.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
i
was
just
--
i
think
it
would
have
to
be
a
diversity
case
in
order
to
get
there
and
that's
why
we
can't
go
there.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
in
cases
involving
state
versus
other
states,
the
court
has
consistently
held
that
these
kind
of
cases
are
governed
by
interstate
common
law
or
federal
common
law
of
nuisance.
in
suits
between
states
and
citizens
of
other
states,
when
a
state
was
not
involved,
to
me
the
law
was
unclear.
i
can't
find
any
clear
holding
--
mr.
fred
i.
parker
i
would
be,
yes.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
because
as
i
understand
it
--
well
the
only
way,
i
could
understand
to
get
into
a
federal
district
court
--
mr.
fred
i.
parker
i
had
never
understood
that
to
be
the
case.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
yes,
i
am
acquainted
with
it
your
honor.
i
don't
fully
understand
it.
it
seems
to
stand
alone
and
--
mr.
fred
i.
parker
i
think
if
i
were
plaintiff
in
that
suit
in
a
federal
court,
i
would
urge
that
was
a
case,
but
i
don't
find
that
to
be
the
law
at
this
point
in
time.
i
am
afraid
that
the
federal
district
court
wouldn't
let
you
litigate
and
therefore
you'd
be
without
a
forum.
you'd
end
up
in
a
state
court
--
mr.
fred
i.
parker
yes,
it
did
and
that's
the
only
one
so
far
as
i
know.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
no,
there
are
no
holding
--
mr.
fred
i.
parker
that's
correct.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
well
as
i
understand
wyandotte,
that
case
said,
go
back
to
the
state
court.
it
did
not
direct
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
to
go
to
the
federal
district
court.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
it's
possibly
the
case
and
we
may
have
that
here
in
this
case,
if
we
have
to.
if
this
court
does
not
take
jurisdiction,
we
may
very
well
end
up
back
in
a
state
court
in
vermont.
but
in
that
case,
we
would
only
be
against
international
paper
company
and
i
don't
believe
that
we
could
get
complete
relief,
and
that
is
my
argument.
mr.
fred
i.
parker
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
seems
clear
to
me
that
the
court
has
well
in
mind
the
issues
in
this
case
and
i
don't
have
anything
further
except
that
i
hate
to
leave
the
record
reflecting
the
new
york
allegations
of
diligence
and
for
suing
international
paper
company,
in
this
case.
the
discharges
in
the
lake
champlain
have
occurred
for
45
years
and
many,
many
years
there
were
no
suits,
whatsoever.
it
was
several
years
after
vermont
began
pushing
new
york
before
any
litigation
was
initiated
and
it's
notable
that
no
litigation
ever
sought
a
preliminary
injunction.
in
fact,
what
happened
in
each
case
was
that
international
paper
company
would
come
forward
with
its
schedule
as
to
abatement
and
new
york
would
agree
with
it
and
then
there
were
delays
and
there
were
numerous
changes
of
deadline
until
such
time
as
the
paper
company
finally
did
construct
and
began
operation
of
its
new
mill
at
which
point
the
question
of
the
lawsuit
became
moot.
unless
there
are
questions
i
have
further.
