mr.
philip
weinberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
to
accept
this
case,
would
be
to
undercut
precisely
what
this
court
held
in
wyandotte,
where
the
relief
sought
by
the
plaintiff
was
virtually
identical
namely
an
injunction
against
the
alleged
pollution
of
water
of
an
interstate
lake
and
damages
therefore.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
wyandotte
is
completely
dispositive
here.
the
court
there
properly
held
that
in
the
case
such
as
that
involving
complex
issues
effect
and
bottomed
on
local
law,
in
which
the
factual
questions
were
sharply
contested
and
in
which
in
this
court's
phrase,
novel
scientific
issues
were
involved,
that
although
concededly
there
was
jurisdiction
in
this
court,
it
was
precisely
the
sort
of
question
that
the
court
should
not
get
entangled
in.
mr.
philip
weinberg
certainly
is
mr.
justice
stewart
and
it's
precisely
our
of
point
that
there
is
no
genuine
controversy
between
the
two
states
here.
mr.
philip
weinberg
that's
certainly
true,
once
we
go
beyond
the
surface
representation
that
two
states
are
involved
in
and
look
at
the
realities
of
the
case,
however
that
it
seems
to
me
just
close
or
broad
because
was
in
fact,
new
york
was
injected.
i
don't
want
to
characterize
why
new
york
was
injected,
but
certainly,
but
the
only
reason
for
the
presence
of
new
york
here
is
to
obtain
some
sort
of
a
possible
jurisdiction
in
this
court,
when
in
fact
everything
that
vermont
wants,
they
want
from
international
paper.
it's
conceded
on
this
record
here
that
the
new
york
didn't
contribute
one
scintilla
of
pollution
to
the
lake.
new
york
had
no
more
to
do
with
creating
the
sludge
bed
then
china
did,
and
that's
beyond
dispute.
the
sludge
bed
was
created
by
international
paper
and
perhaps
by
other
private
parties
as
well.
mr.
philip
weinberg
that's
certainly
true
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
philip
weinberg
it
would
only
be
a
federal
common
law
of
nuisance
case
under
our
view
of
the
law
if
the
state
were
a
proper
party,
and
if
a
genuine
claim
for
relief
existed
as
against
new
york.
now
the
answer
it
seems
to
me
is
that
in
contrast
to
other
situation
such
as
the
previous
case
that
was
argued
this
morning
involving
milwaukee,
new
york
has
been
more
than
diligent,
it’s
actually
been
aggressive
in
dealing
with
this
problem.
we
forced
international
paper
to
cleanup
the
pollution
that
it
was
causing
in
lake
champlain.
we
took
them
to
court.
the
case
is
cited
in
our
original
brief.
we
obtained
a
consent
to
create
consent
judgment
of
injunction,
directing
international
paper
to
cease
its
active
pollution
and
it’s
conceded
now
that
there
is
no
longer
any
active
pollution
from
this
source
at
all.
and
following
that,
we
represented
to
the
enforcement
conference
at
which
vermont
and
new
york
and
the
federal
agencies
were
all
parties,
we
represented
to
them
that
we
would
take
whatever
steps
were
necessary
or
appropriate
to
abate
the
pollution
caused
by
the
sludge
bed,
and
pursuant
to
that,
we
entered
into
a
pilot
study
in
which
vermont
originally
participated,
prior
to
they
kicking
over
the
traces,
and
subsequent
to
that
the
study
in
which
new
york
engaged
a
highly
respected
independent
consultant,
and
the
conclusion
based
on
that
study
which
has
never
been
controverted
by
anyone
except
by
vermont
in
this
lawsuit,
not
by
any
federal
agency,
not
by
any
new
york
agency,
not
by
anyone
else
except
vermont,
was
that
the
pollution,
the
active
pollution
had
now
completely
ceased
that
whatever
damage
the
sludge
bed
was
causing
was
due
to
the
active
pollution
of
the
lake,
and
then
in
fact,
the
problem
was
dissipating
and
the
sludge
bed
itself
was
stabilizing.
the
report,
a
copy
of
the
summary
of
which
is
appended
to
our
supplemental
brief
plainly
indicates
that
fish
are
now
returning
to
that
portion
of
the
lake,
and
that
of
the
various
alternatives
by
far
the
safest
one,
by
far
the
most
practical
and
by
far
the
most
realistic
from
an
environmental
standpoint
is
to
simply
leave
the
sludge
bed
alone,
because
what’s
happening
now
is
a
natural
process
of
stabilization
under
which
fish
and
other
marine
life
are
returning
to
the
lake.
the
thesis
of
(inaudible)
so
on
and
the
bubbling
which
have
complained
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes
sir
it
does,
but
it’s
simply
unavoidable
to
discuss
that
it
seems
to
me
in
the
context
as
this
court
said
in
wyandotte
whether
in
prudence
or
in
discretion
it
ought
to
accept
this
case.
mr.
philip
weinberg
the
first
answer
to
that
it
seems
to
me
mr.
justice
stewart
is
that
these
are
issues
which
a
state
court
or
perhaps
even
a
federal
district
court
could
address
itself
to
and
if
international
paper
were
ordered
by
the
state
court
of
either
vermont
or
new
york
to
remove
the
sludge
bed,
then
at
that
point
it
would
be
under
an
injunction
and
it
would
have
to
do
so
if
new
york
wanted
to
step
in
then
new
york
can
do
so
in
it's
courts.
mr.
philip
weinberg
well,
it
could
and
that
question
would
then
be
litigated
in
the
state
court
of
either
vermont
or
new
york,
that’s
one
answer
to
it,
the
second
answer
to
it
is
that
vermont
alleges
in
its
own
complaint,
that
part
of
the
sludge
bed
is
on
its
own
territory.
now
vermont
had
as
much
to
do
with
putting
that
sludge
bed
there
as
new
york
did,
virtually
nothing.
mr.
philip
weinberg
that’s
certainly
true,
but
it’s
highly
speculative
i
think
to
assume
that
new
york
would
attempt
to
block
an
injunction
if
vermont
could
obtain
one
in
its
own
courts
or
in
new
york
state.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
but
this
is
something
that
could
be
litigated
as
between
vermont
and
international
paper
in
the
state
courts,
and
if
new
york
wanted
to
become
a
party,
new
york
could
certainly
be
free
to
intervene
as
new
york
has
done
as
a
plaintiff
or
defendant
in
numerous
occasions
in
its
own
courts,
and
i
don't
see
any
reason
why
it
couldn’t
do
in
the
vermont
courts
as
well.
it’s
even
conceivable
under
texas
against
pankey
that
there
is
some
sort
of
a
federal
cause
of
action
here.
in
any
event
there
were
certainly
two
or
possibly
three
forums
where
all
these
difficult
factual
questions
could
be
resolved,
and
if
new
york
wanted
to
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
no,
but
i
don't
see
the
reason
for
making
new
york
a
defendant
here.
mr.
philip
weinberg
if
new
york
wanted
to
interpose
assuming
that
an
injunction
were
granted,
a
mandatory
injunction
requiring
the
sludge
bed
to
be
removed,
if
at
that
point
new
york
elected
to
step
into
the
case,
it
could
move
to
intervene,
and
if
it
didn't,
then
it
would
have
waived
whatever
objection
it
has.
so
it
seems
to
me
that,
that’s
not
a
reason
for
having
the
court,
this
court
hear
the
case
in
first
instance.
mr.
philip
weinberg
in
situations
like
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
which
i
have
personally
been
involved,
the
new
york
has
simply
executed
a
consent
under
which
the
private
party
can
remove
whatever
it
is.
we
had
a
case
like
that
involving
pollution
of
the
hudson
by
the
marathon
battery
company.
the
case
was
heard
in
the
southern
district
court.
it
was
brought
by
the
united
states
attorney.
new
york
was
made
a
party
defendant
solely
for
that
purpose,
or
intervened
i
believe
it
was,
solely
for
that
purpose,
and
we
simply
executed
a
consent
for
letting
the
defendant
under
the
consent
decree
to
go
on
the
underwater
land
and
remove
what
was
allegedly
causing
the
disturbance.
i
think
the
point
to
remember
here
in
regard
to
all
of
this
is
that
when
one
talks
about
a
state
owning
underwater
land
or
owning
the
water
of
a
lake,
any
water
pollution
whether
it’s
done
by
municipality
or
by
any
sort
of
an
industry
could
be
with
the
same
logic
that
vermont
is
asserting
here,
be
blamed
on
the
state,
just
as
ohio
sued
the
wyandotte
chemical
company
and
the
other
defendants
in
that
case,
it
could
have
sued
the
state
of
michigan
or
the
province
of
ontario
if
it
wanted
to,
using
the
same
logic
that
they
were
depositing
toxic
material
into
lake
erie
and
that
consequently,
it
was
the
responsibility
of
the
state.
and
had
that
happened
we
would
have
had
the
same
situation
we
have
here,
namely
the
spurious
injection
of
a
state
in
order
to
provide
some
sort
of
bootstrap
jurisdiction
for
this
court
which
in
fact
is
improper,
and
everyone
of
the
reasons
why
this
court
in
the
exercise
of
its
prudence
and
discretion
rejected
this
suit
in
ohio
against
wyandotte
are
applicable
here.
there
are
many
of
the
state
bodies,
including
the
potomac
right
here
as
well
as
all
of
the
great
lakes,
the
hudson
river,
the
delaware
river,
and
others
where
the
same
sort
of
logic
would
apply.
obviously,
all
the
lands
on
one
side
or
the
other
will
cross
interstate
boundaries.
the
underwater
land
is
owned
by
one
state
or
the
other,
and
using
the
reasoning
which
vermont
is
using
here
you
could
name
the
state
as
a
party
defendant
and
have
any
one
of
those
plethora
of
cases
litigated
in
this
court.
now
in
contrast
to
what
we
heard
earlier
in
case
number
49,
where
there
was
a
history
of,
i
believe
it’s
fair
to
say,
fair
bit
of
grapple
with
the
serious
pollution
problem
in
lake
michigan
on
the
part
of
the
municipal
authorities
there,
new
york
has
aggressively
acted
and
as
i
indicated
took
the
state
of
vermont
–
took
the
international
paper
company
to
court.
thereafter
we
had
the
study,
a
summary
of
which
is
appended
to
my
brief,
and
with
court's
permission
i
would
like
to
hand
up
by
giving
to
the
clerk
at
the
conclusion
of
my
argument,
a
copy
of
the
full
report.
vermont
attempts
to
steer
around
the
wyndotte
case
saying
in
effect
that
it’s
clear
that
the
sludge
bed
must
be
removed,
but
in
fact
no
agency
with
jurisdiction
over
the
sludge
bed
has
ever
said
so.
the
army
engineers
have
plenary
jurisdiction
over
the
state
waters,
and
navigable
waters,
and
they
have
never
so
much
as
suggested
that
there
was
any
interference
with
what
little
navigation
may
exist
on
this
part
of
the
lake.
new
york
has
been
in
constant
communication
with
the
department
of
the
interior
and
after
that
would
be
eca.
there
is
a
letter
from
new
york’s
state
commission
of
diamond
(ph)
to
secretary
hickel,
and
next
to
international
paper's
first
brief,
there
is
a
subsequent
letter
to
mr.
wrickleshouse
(ph).
there
was
never
any
reply
to
any
of
those
letters
which
indicated
the
slightest
displeasure
on
the
part
of
the
federal
authorities
with
the
course
that
new
york
has
been
taking,
and
new
york
has
kept
them
appraised
continually.
there
just
isn’t
the
–
the
problem
here
that
vermont
insists
there
is.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes
sir,
but
they
certainly
have
authority
to
abate
any
impediment
to
navigations
such
as
vermont
alleges
there
is.
mr.
philip
weinberg
it’s
my
understanding
mr.
justice
douglas
that
army
engineers
have
the
power
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
well
they
do
dwell
in
as
a
sort
of
a
de
minimis
or
make
way
to
argument
to
impediments
in
navigations
although
they
have
never
complained
to
the
new
york
authorities
about
that,
except
by
bringing
the
suit
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
no
i
don't
--
vermont
certainly
alleges
both
and
we
submit
that
there
is
no
merit
to
either
claim
and
in
direct
contrast
to
every
other
pollution
case
this
court
has
ever
accepted
including
georgia
against
tennessee
copper,
and
michigan
and
illinois
and
all
the
rest,
where
there
were
the
most
serious,
dangerous
of
epidemic
and
large
scale
pollution
of
interstate
waters
and
so
on.
there
is
nothing
of
the
sort
involved
here.
what
we
have
here
is
a
sludge
bed
which
is
rapidly
stabilizing
itself
in
any
event
which
is
only
less
than
a
half
a
square
mile
in
size
and
in
fact
there
is
an
existing
suit
which
is
referred
to
in
our
briefs.
mr.
philip
weinberg
i'm
not
suggesting
that
it's
attractive.
i'm
simply
suggesting
that
there
is
not
the
massive
course
of
action
here
that
vermont
insists
there
is
and
that
we
have
to
put
the
case
in
the
proper
context
in
contrast
to
georgia
against
tennessee
copper,
and
other
cases
nearly
all
of
which
in
any
event
antedated
the
whole
arsenal
of
statutory
remedies
which
were
available
in
a
situation
like
this.
any
water
pollution
by
definition
that's
in
the
state
body
of
water
is
on
some
states
under
water
lands
and
if
there
is
any
sort
of
sediment
or
anything,
then
it's
going
to
fall
on
lands
that
are
owned
by
one
state
or
the
other.
and
to
hold
that
this
court
had
jurisdiction
solely
on
that
basis,
would
be
reflectively
overrule
wyandotte
in
any
case
involving
an
interstate
body
of
water
and
simply
permit
the
plaintiff
state
to
elect
to
name
the
other
state,
which
it
shares
the
body
of
water
with
as
a
party
defendant.
for
these
reasons
we
maintain
that
vermont
has
an
ample
forum
in
the
courts
of
either
state
and
its
motion
for
to
leave
to
file
this
complaint
should
be
denied.
mr.
philip
weinberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
to
accept
this
case,
would
be
to
undercut
precisely
what
this
court
held
in
wyandotte,
where
the
relief
sought
by
the
plaintiff
was
virtually
identical
namely
an
injunction
against
the
alleged
pollution
of
water
of
an
interstate
lake
and
damages
therefore.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
wyandotte
is
completely
dispositive
here.
the
court
there
properly
held
that
in
the
case
such
as
that
involving
complex
issues
effect
and
bottomed
on
local
law,
in
which
the
factual
questions
were
sharply
contested
and
in
which
in
this
court's
phrase,
novel
scientific
issues
were
involved,
that
although
concededly
there
was
jurisdiction
in
this
court,
it
was
precisely
the
sort
of
question
that
the
court
should
not
get
entangled
in.
mr.
philip
weinberg
certainly
is
mr.
justice
stewart
and
it's
precisely
our
of
point
that
there
is
no
genuine
controversy
between
the
two
states
here.
mr.
philip
weinberg
that's
certainly
true,
once
we
go
beyond
the
surface
representation
that
two
states
are
involved
in
and
look
at
the
realities
of
the
case,
however
that
it
seems
to
me
just
close
or
broad
because
was
in
fact,
new
york
was
injected.
i
don't
want
to
characterize
why
new
york
was
injected,
but
certainly,
but
the
only
reason
for
the
presence
of
new
york
here
is
to
obtain
some
sort
of
a
possible
jurisdiction
in
this
court,
when
in
fact
everything
that
vermont
wants,
they
want
from
international
paper.
it's
conceded
on
this
record
here
that
the
new
york
didn't
contribute
one
scintilla
of
pollution
to
the
lake.
new
york
had
no
more
to
do
with
creating
the
sludge
bed
then
china
did,
and
that's
beyond
dispute.
the
sludge
bed
was
created
by
international
paper
and
perhaps
by
other
private
parties
as
well.
mr.
philip
weinberg
that's
certainly
true
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
philip
weinberg
it
would
only
be
a
federal
common
law
of
nuisance
case
under
our
view
of
the
law
if
the
state
were
a
proper
party,
and
if
a
genuine
claim
for
relief
existed
as
against
new
york.
now
the
answer
it
seems
to
me
is
that
in
contrast
to
other
situation
such
as
the
previous
case
that
was
argued
this
morning
involving
milwaukee,
new
york
has
been
more
than
diligent,
it’s
actually
been
aggressive
in
dealing
with
this
problem.
we
forced
international
paper
to
cleanup
the
pollution
that
it
was
causing
in
lake
champlain.
we
took
them
to
court.
the
case
is
cited
in
our
original
brief.
we
obtained
a
consent
to
create
consent
judgment
of
injunction,
directing
international
paper
to
cease
its
active
pollution
and
it’s
conceded
now
that
there
is
no
longer
any
active
pollution
from
this
source
at
all.
and
following
that,
we
represented
to
the
enforcement
conference
at
which
vermont
and
new
york
and
the
federal
agencies
were
all
parties,
we
represented
to
them
that
we
would
take
whatever
steps
were
necessary
or
appropriate
to
abate
the
pollution
caused
by
the
sludge
bed,
and
pursuant
to
that,
we
entered
into
a
pilot
study
in
which
vermont
originally
participated,
prior
to
they
kicking
over
the
traces,
and
subsequent
to
that
the
study
in
which
new
york
engaged
a
highly
respected
independent
consultant,
and
the
conclusion
based
on
that
study
which
has
never
been
controverted
by
anyone
except
by
vermont
in
this
lawsuit,
not
by
any
federal
agency,
not
by
any
new
york
agency,
not
by
anyone
else
except
vermont,
was
that
the
pollution,
the
active
pollution
had
now
completely
ceased
that
whatever
damage
the
sludge
bed
was
causing
was
due
to
the
active
pollution
of
the
lake,
and
then
in
fact,
the
problem
was
dissipating
and
the
sludge
bed
itself
was
stabilizing.
the
report,
a
copy
of
the
summary
of
which
is
appended
to
our
supplemental
brief
plainly
indicates
that
fish
are
now
returning
to
that
portion
of
the
lake,
and
that
of
the
various
alternatives
by
far
the
safest
one,
by
far
the
most
practical
and
by
far
the
most
realistic
from
an
environmental
standpoint
is
to
simply
leave
the
sludge
bed
alone,
because
what’s
happening
now
is
a
natural
process
of
stabilization
under
which
fish
and
other
marine
life
are
returning
to
the
lake.
the
thesis
of
(inaudible)
so
on
and
the
bubbling
which
have
complained
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes
sir
it
does,
but
it’s
simply
unavoidable
to
discuss
that
it
seems
to
me
in
the
context
as
this
court
said
in
wyandotte
whether
in
prudence
or
in
discretion
it
ought
to
accept
this
case.
mr.
philip
weinberg
the
first
answer
to
that
it
seems
to
me
mr.
justice
stewart
is
that
these
are
issues
which
a
state
court
or
perhaps
even
a
federal
district
court
could
address
itself
to
and
if
international
paper
were
ordered
by
the
state
court
of
either
vermont
or
new
york
to
remove
the
sludge
bed,
then
at
that
point
it
would
be
under
an
injunction
and
it
would
have
to
do
so
if
new
york
wanted
to
step
in
then
new
york
can
do
so
in
it's
courts.
mr.
philip
weinberg
well,
it
could
and
that
question
would
then
be
litigated
in
the
state
court
of
either
vermont
or
new
york,
that’s
one
answer
to
it,
the
second
answer
to
it
is
that
vermont
alleges
in
its
own
complaint,
that
part
of
the
sludge
bed
is
on
its
own
territory.
now
vermont
had
as
much
to
do
with
putting
that
sludge
bed
there
as
new
york
did,
virtually
nothing.
mr.
philip
weinberg
that’s
certainly
true,
but
it’s
highly
speculative
i
think
to
assume
that
new
york
would
attempt
to
block
an
injunction
if
vermont
could
obtain
one
in
its
own
courts
or
in
new
york
state.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
but
this
is
something
that
could
be
litigated
as
between
vermont
and
international
paper
in
the
state
courts,
and
if
new
york
wanted
to
become
a
party,
new
york
could
certainly
be
free
to
intervene
as
new
york
has
done
as
a
plaintiff
or
defendant
in
numerous
occasions
in
its
own
courts,
and
i
don't
see
any
reason
why
it
couldn’t
do
in
the
vermont
courts
as
well.
it’s
even
conceivable
under
texas
against
pankey
that
there
is
some
sort
of
a
federal
cause
of
action
here.
in
any
event
there
were
certainly
two
or
possibly
three
forums
where
all
these
difficult
factual
questions
could
be
resolved,
and
if
new
york
wanted
to
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
no,
but
i
don't
see
the
reason
for
making
new
york
a
defendant
here.
mr.
philip
weinberg
if
new
york
wanted
to
interpose
assuming
that
an
injunction
were
granted,
a
mandatory
injunction
requiring
the
sludge
bed
to
be
removed,
if
at
that
point
new
york
elected
to
step
into
the
case,
it
could
move
to
intervene,
and
if
it
didn't,
then
it
would
have
waived
whatever
objection
it
has.
so
it
seems
to
me
that,
that’s
not
a
reason
for
having
the
court,
this
court
hear
the
case
in
first
instance.
mr.
philip
weinberg
in
situations
like
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
which
i
have
personally
been
involved,
the
new
york
has
simply
executed
a
consent
under
which
the
private
party
can
remove
whatever
it
is.
we
had
a
case
like
that
involving
pollution
of
the
hudson
by
the
marathon
battery
company.
the
case
was
heard
in
the
southern
district
court.
it
was
brought
by
the
united
states
attorney.
new
york
was
made
a
party
defendant
solely
for
that
purpose,
or
intervened
i
believe
it
was,
solely
for
that
purpose,
and
we
simply
executed
a
consent
for
letting
the
defendant
under
the
consent
decree
to
go
on
the
underwater
land
and
remove
what
was
allegedly
causing
the
disturbance.
i
think
the
point
to
remember
here
in
regard
to
all
of
this
is
that
when
one
talks
about
a
state
owning
underwater
land
or
owning
the
water
of
a
lake,
any
water
pollution
whether
it’s
done
by
municipality
or
by
any
sort
of
an
industry
could
be
with
the
same
logic
that
vermont
is
asserting
here,
be
blamed
on
the
state,
just
as
ohio
sued
the
wyandotte
chemical
company
and
the
other
defendants
in
that
case,
it
could
have
sued
the
state
of
michigan
or
the
province
of
ontario
if
it
wanted
to,
using
the
same
logic
that
they
were
depositing
toxic
material
into
lake
erie
and
that
consequently,
it
was
the
responsibility
of
the
state.
and
had
that
happened
we
would
have
had
the
same
situation
we
have
here,
namely
the
spurious
injection
of
a
state
in
order
to
provide
some
sort
of
bootstrap
jurisdiction
for
this
court
which
in
fact
is
improper,
and
everyone
of
the
reasons
why
this
court
in
the
exercise
of
its
prudence
and
discretion
rejected
this
suit
in
ohio
against
wyandotte
are
applicable
here.
there
are
many
of
the
state
bodies,
including
the
potomac
right
here
as
well
as
all
of
the
great
lakes,
the
hudson
river,
the
delaware
river,
and
others
where
the
same
sort
of
logic
would
apply.
obviously,
all
the
lands
on
one
side
or
the
other
will
cross
interstate
boundaries.
the
underwater
land
is
owned
by
one
state
or
the
other,
and
using
the
reasoning
which
vermont
is
using
here
you
could
name
the
state
as
a
party
defendant
and
have
any
one
of
those
plethora
of
cases
litigated
in
this
court.
now
in
contrast
to
what
we
heard
earlier
in
case
number
49,
where
there
was
a
history
of,
i
believe
it’s
fair
to
say,
fair
bit
of
grapple
with
the
serious
pollution
problem
in
lake
michigan
on
the
part
of
the
municipal
authorities
there,
new
york
has
aggressively
acted
and
as
i
indicated
took
the
state
of
vermont
–
took
the
international
paper
company
to
court.
thereafter
we
had
the
study,
a
summary
of
which
is
appended
to
my
brief,
and
with
court's
permission
i
would
like
to
hand
up
by
giving
to
the
clerk
at
the
conclusion
of
my
argument,
a
copy
of
the
full
report.
vermont
attempts
to
steer
around
the
wyndotte
case
saying
in
effect
that
it’s
clear
that
the
sludge
bed
must
be
removed,
but
in
fact
no
agency
with
jurisdiction
over
the
sludge
bed
has
ever
said
so.
the
army
engineers
have
plenary
jurisdiction
over
the
state
waters,
and
navigable
waters,
and
they
have
never
so
much
as
suggested
that
there
was
any
interference
with
what
little
navigation
may
exist
on
this
part
of
the
lake.
new
york
has
been
in
constant
communication
with
the
department
of
the
interior
and
after
that
would
be
eca.
there
is
a
letter
from
new
york’s
state
commission
of
diamond
(ph)
to
secretary
hickel,
and
next
to
international
paper's
first
brief,
there
is
a
subsequent
letter
to
mr.
wrickleshouse
(ph).
there
was
never
any
reply
to
any
of
those
letters
which
indicated
the
slightest
displeasure
on
the
part
of
the
federal
authorities
with
the
course
that
new
york
has
been
taking,
and
new
york
has
kept
them
appraised
continually.
there
just
isn’t
the
–
the
problem
here
that
vermont
insists
there
is.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes
sir,
but
they
certainly
have
authority
to
abate
any
impediment
to
navigations
such
as
vermont
alleges
there
is.
mr.
philip
weinberg
it’s
my
understanding
mr.
justice
douglas
that
army
engineers
have
the
power
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
well
they
do
dwell
in
as
a
sort
of
a
de
minimis
or
make
way
to
argument
to
impediments
in
navigations
although
they
have
never
complained
to
the
new
york
authorities
about
that,
except
by
bringing
the
suit
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
no
i
don't
--
vermont
certainly
alleges
both
and
we
submit
that
there
is
no
merit
to
either
claim
and
in
direct
contrast
to
every
other
pollution
case
this
court
has
ever
accepted
including
georgia
against
tennessee
copper,
and
michigan
and
illinois
and
all
the
rest,
where
there
were
the
most
serious,
dangerous
of
epidemic
and
large
scale
pollution
of
interstate
waters
and
so
on.
there
is
nothing
of
the
sort
involved
here.
what
we
have
here
is
a
sludge
bed
which
is
rapidly
stabilizing
itself
in
any
event
which
is
only
less
than
a
half
a
square
mile
in
size
and
in
fact
there
is
an
existing
suit
which
is
referred
to
in
our
briefs.
mr.
philip
weinberg
i'm
not
suggesting
that
it's
attractive.
i'm
simply
suggesting
that
there
is
not
the
massive
course
of
action
here
that
vermont
insists
there
is
and
that
we
have
to
put
the
case
in
the
proper
context
in
contrast
to
georgia
against
tennessee
copper,
and
other
cases
nearly
all
of
which
in
any
event
antedated
the
whole
arsenal
of
statutory
remedies
which
were
available
in
a
situation
like
this.
any
water
pollution
by
definition
that's
in
the
state
body
of
water
is
on
some
states
under
water
lands
and
if
there
is
any
sort
of
sediment
or
anything,
then
it's
going
to
fall
on
lands
that
are
owned
by
one
state
or
the
other.
and
to
hold
that
this
court
had
jurisdiction
solely
on
that
basis,
would
be
reflectively
overrule
wyandotte
in
any
case
involving
an
interstate
body
of
water
and
simply
permit
the
plaintiff
state
to
elect
to
name
the
other
state,
which
it
shares
the
body
of
water
with
as
a
party
defendant.
for
these
reasons
we
maintain
that
vermont
has
an
ample
forum
in
the
courts
of
either
state
and
its
motion
for
to
leave
to
file
this
complaint
should
be
denied.
