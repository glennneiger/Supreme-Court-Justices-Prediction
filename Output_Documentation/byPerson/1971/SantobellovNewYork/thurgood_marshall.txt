mr.
sullivan,
you
say
on
the
pre-sentence
report
that
when
we
study
it,
we
will
then
know
that
it
those
could
be
done
by
the
maximum
sentence?
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then,
again,
i
assume
that
the
district
attorney
had
the
same
feeling?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
did
he
take
his
time
arguing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
did
he
make
the
statement
that
he
had
to
make
extra
sentencing
period,
if
he
was
so
sure
that
there
was
nothing
else
judge
marks
could
do
but
give
him
the
maximum.
he
could
have
mooted
this
whole
thing
out,
could
he
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
say
we
can
look
at
this
pre-sentence
report
which
i
have
looked
at,
you
say
we
will
be
overwhelmed
and
there
is
nothing
else
we
can
do.
i
do
not
see
why
you
have
the
presentation
at
all
if
the
sentence
is
unclear.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
we
are
trying
to
do
is
find
out
what
is
in
the
states
attorney's
mind
and
what
is
in
the
judge’s
mind
