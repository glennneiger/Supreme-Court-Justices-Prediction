mr.
irving
anolik
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
appeal
provision
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
york
which
affirmed
a
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
bronx
county
convicting
santobello,
the
petitioner
of
possession
of
gambling
records
in
the
second
degree
as
a
misdemeanor
upon
his
plea
of
guilty.
the
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
or
not
but
for
a
promise
--
mr.
irving
anolik
--
which
admittedly
was
articulated
by
the
assistant
district
attorney
to
refrain
from
any
recommendation
with
respect
to
sentence,
santobello
would
have
pled
guilty
in
the
first
place.
we
maintain
that
is
the
only
issue
before
this
court.
at
the
trial
level,
the
executive
assistant
mr.
rodka(ph)
when
asked
whether
or
not
a
promise
had
been
articulated.
that
is
when
he
was
asked
before
the
sentencing
judge
said
that
the
minutes
of
the
plea
did
not
reveal
any
such
promise.
although
he
had
been
personally
present
at
the
plea.
commendably,
mr.
sullivan
who
was
chief
of
the
appeals
bureau
of
that
office
inquired
of
assistant
district
attorney
greenfield
who
had
been
also
present
at
the
plea
of
guilty
with
mr.
rodka
and
he
notified
mr.
sullivan
that
such
a
promise
had
indeed
been
made.
and
that
in
the
briefs
before
this
court
as
they
were
before
the
appellate
division
of
the
supreme
court
of
new
york,
there
is
a
concession
that
the
promise
had
in
fact
been
made
and
broken.
we
respectfully
maintain
that
had
mr.
rodka,
the
executive
assistant,
told
justice
gelanoff
who
was
the
sentencing
judge
in
this
case
that
the
promise
in
fact
had
been
made.
one,
justice
gelanoff
probably
would
have
permitted
a
withdrawal
of
the
plea
of
guilty
or
two,
certainly
under
the
american
bar
associations
standards,
the
district
attorney
would
have
been
bound
to
have
assisted
the
defendant
in
withdrawing
his
plea
of
guilty.
instead
the
impression
was
left
with
justice
gelanoff
that
no
such
promise
had
been
made.
direct
application
on
appeal
was
more
solace
to
santobello.
now,
in
the
course
of
the
proceedings
--
mr.
irving
anolik
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
irving
anolik
that
is
correct
and
we
maintain
that
that
has
a
substantial
influence
contrary
to
my
illustrious
colleague
here,
we
maintain
that
as
a
substantial
influence
upon
a
sentencing
court.
in
their
brief
they
maintain
that
judges
are
never
influenced
by
recommendations
or
lack
of
recommendations
of
the
prosecutors.
mr.
irving
anolik
that
is
quite
true
justice
stewart
he
said
that.
but
we
maintain
that
what
he
said
and
the
consequences
of
what
he
did
are
quite
incompatible.
we
maintain
that
in
white
v.
gattney
(ph)
for
example
the
tenth
circuit
case
which
is
adverted
to,
that
there
too
the
judge,
said
he
is
not
a
listed
influence.
since
my
colleague
here
went
dehors
the
record
so
to
speak
in
saying
judges
are
never
influenced
and
incidentally,
he
is
my
successor
as
chief
of
the
appeals
bureau
on
that
office.
i
think
that
i
can
ask
this
court
to
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
judges
are
frequently
influenced
by
what
prosecutor’s
say.
so
to
say
that
it
was
diminished
or
that
the
judge
merely
by
articulating
that
he
was
not
influenced
is
of
no
solace
because
it
begs
the
question.
the
issue
here
is
not
whether
the
sentence
was
fair.
that
is
not
the
issue
at
all
but
that
seems
to
be
what
the
respondent
is
maintaining.
that
the
sentence
was
fair,
it
was
the
maximum
permitted
under
law
and
perhaps
it
was
fair.
but
that
is
not
the
issue.
mr.
irving
anolik
that
is
absolutely
correct
justice
stewart
and
that
is
our
position.
now
in
the
course
of
--
mr.
irving
anolik
no.
the
remedy
would
be
--
mr.
irving
anolik
because
the
--
well,
it
conceivably
could
be
the
delivery
of
the
promise
except
that
now
because
of
the
notoriety
which
this
case
has
achieved,
we
maintain
that
it
would
be
of
no
use.
this
case
is
extremely
well-known
now
in
bronx
county.
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
a
judge
certainly
can
be
assumed
to
make
a
decision
independently.
justice
gelanoff
if
no
articulation
of
a
promise
at
all
had
taken
place,
quite
possibly
might
have
given
the
year
sentence.
that
is
entirely
possible.
mr.
irving
anolik
that
is
what
he
said
at
the
time.
however
that
is
merely
speculation
because
--
mr.
irving
anolik
he
does
want
to
withdraw
his
plea.
that
is
exactly
what
he
wants
to
do
justice.
mr.
irving
anolik
that
is
correct
that
is
the
only
remedy
we
are
seeking
here
is
the
right
to
withdraw
his
plea
of
guilty
and
to
plead
new.
mr.
irving
anolik
that
i
realized.
but
by
the
same
token
it
would
be
the
only
fair
remedy
because
the
fact
remains
that
we
are
now
trying
to
undo
what
has
been
done
wrongly.
mr.
irving
anolik
that
is
correct
and
we
maintain
that
where
there
has
been
a
misrepresentation.
even
if
it
was
without
malicious
intent
and
we
are
not
alleging
maliciousness
here.
even
if
were
without
malicious
intent,
the
only
remedy
is
to
permit
the
withdrawal
of
the
plea
of
guilty.
and
that
is
--
mr.
irving
anolik
in
effect,
yes.
mr.
irving
anolik
yes.
mr.
irving
anolik
alright
and
i
recognized
that
the
possibility
of
that
interpret
--
we
are
not
asking
for
that
and
we
feel
under
the
circumstance
of
this
case
that
would
be
unfair.
because
you
could
not
undo
the
publicity
and
the
notoriety
that
has
taken
place
in
this
case.
mr.
irving
anolik
oh,
by
all
means.
the
reinstatement
of
the
felony
counts
would
certainly
follow
and
that
he
would
have
to
go
to
trial
and
face
the
possibility
of
a
number
of
years
in
jail.
we
well
recognize
that,
i
have
communicated
this
to
the
petitioner
and
he
is
willing
to
take
his
chances
on
that.
mr.
justice
blackmun
there
is
no
question
about
that
he
would
have
to
go
to
trial
on
the
original
felony
counts.
mr.
irving
anolik
no.
well
i
want
to
make
that
quite
sure
that
i
am
not
asking
that
he
be
permitted
to
go
to
trial
in
the
misdemeanor.
that
would
be
totally
unfair
and
i
am
not
trying
to
advocate
such
a
procedure
at
all
justice
blackmun.
the
prosecutor
in
his
brief,
the
respondent’s
brief
indicates
that
during
the
course
of
these
proceedings
and
perhaps
i
should
take
one
moment
just
to
give
you
the
chronology
of
what
occurred
here.
that
the
defendant
here
been
indicted
for
two
felonies
involving
gambling.
he
had
made
a
motion
to
suppress
evidence
returnable
june
17th,
1969.
on
june
16th,
1969,
a
day
before
the
return
day
of
that
motion
he
interposed
a
plea
of
guilty
to
the
misdemeanor
before
justice
marks.
on
the
17th
the
motion
to
suppress
evidence
was
apparently
adjourned
without
any
disposition.
a
lawyer
by
the
name
of
fructman(ph)
represented
the
defendant
during
these
times.
subsequently,
i
believe
it
was
on
september
or
october
of
1969,
a
different
lawyer
by
the
name
of
garanstein(ph)
was
retained
by
the
petitioner
here
in.
and
he
then
apparently
tried
to
revive
the
crescent
or
dormant
motion
to
suppress.
and
in
the
course
of
doing
that
he
indicated
that
this
petitioner
was
unaware
of
certain
rights
which
apparently
was
an
incorrect
statement.
now,
if
there
had
been
an
issue
of
credibility
as
to
whether
or
not
a
promise
had
been
made
or
if
there
had
not
been
a
concession
that
the
promise
had
been
and
broken
then
this
factor
would
be
significant
in
judging
the
credibility
of
the
petitioner.
and
we
maintain
that
bringing
this
issue
out
is
irrelevant
completely.
because
it
begs
the
question
here
namely
that
whether
or
not
the
credibility
of
the
petitioner
is
good
or
bad
after
as
to
a
collateral
issue,
the
fact
remains
that
by
concession,
this
issue
was
crystallized
namely
if
the
promise
was
made
and
broken.
so
to
that
extent
will
you
just
wish
to
distinguish
that
from
the
brief
of
the
respondent.
we
also
maintain
that
in
this
case
the
district
attorney
says,
well
this
defendant
has
never
indicated
that
he
was
innocent.
well,
in
our
brief
of
course
we
say
that
he
is
so
maintaining
but
if
we
look
at
what
he
was
trying
to
do
and
i
think
mr.
justice
blackmun
put
his
finger
on
it.
here
is
the
defendant
who
is
asking
that
he
be
put
back
instead
in
status
quo
anti.
they
would
be
permitted
to
withdraw
this
plea
of
guilty
and
go
to
trial
under
felonies.
well,
obviously
if
you
were
guilty
and
felt
that
he
would
certainly
be
convicted.
i
doubt
that
he
would
seek
such
a
remedy.
so
i
think
that
certainly,
circumstantially
and
inferentially
he
clearly
indicates
and
has
always
indicated
that
he
is
innocent
and
i
think
that
too
is
an
irrelevant
aspect
of
this
case
because
the
petitioner
has
made
no
doubt
whatsoever
as
to
what
he
is
seeking
here
and
no
more
and
no
less
of
course.
at
the
time
of
the
sentencing,
i
might
point
out
most
respectfully
to
your
honors
that
the
sentencing
minutes
begin
at
page
21
(a)
of
the
joint
appendix
inadvertently,
it
seems
that
the
printer
calling
it
plea.
the
sentence
begins
at
21
(a)
of
the
joint
appendix.
now,
at
the
time
of
the
sentencing
here
which
incidentally
came
on
before
a
different
justice
than
the
justice
who
accepted
the
plea
of
the
guilty,
justice
marks
as
i
had
indicated
accepted
the
plea
of
guilty.
he
had
retired
at
the
end
of
1969
and
he
then
apparently
was
superseded
in
the
capacity
of
sentencing
judge
anyway
by
justice
gelanoff.
the
district
attorney
argues
in
his
briefs
and
there
is
no
basis
in
the
record
for
this
incidentally
but
he
contends
in
his
brief
that
santobello
received
the
functional
equivalency
of
his
promise.
now
i
frankly
fail
to
follow
that
line
of
reasoning
and
i
believe
that
it
is
a
casuistic
line
of
reasoning.
because
there
was
no
functional
equivalency
here,
he
said
that
after
all,
the
respondent
says
after
all
justice
gelanoff
said
that
he
did
not
really
pay
any
attention
to
the
prosecutor.
now,
we
have
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
prosecutor
here
who
was
the
executive
assistant.
i
think
second
or
third
in
command
of
that
office
came
in
and
made
an
impassioned
plea
for
the
maximum
possible
sentence
under
the
law,
adverting
to
merits
clearly
dehors
the
record
conceiving
in
the
record
that
he
did
not
know
what
the
probation
report
contained.
linking
this
defendant
with
organized
crime
whether
or
not
there
is
such
a
thing
that
probation
report,
i
do
not
know
because
i
have
not
seen
it.
mr.
irving
anolik
oh
yes.
yes
at
page
--
mr.
irving
anolik
yes
but
at
page
33,
34
and
35,
i
think
you
will
find
that
mr.
chief
justice.
and
i
think
that
that
is
very
significant
because
after
all
we
are
not
just
dealing
with
a
simple
articulation
of
a
statement.
at
page
38,
the
actual
or
the
word
arraign
him
for
sentence
appear.
so
from
21
to
30
(a)
are
just
preliminaries
although
it
is
a
part
of
a
sentencing
minutes.
but
at
30
(a)
begins
the
actual
meet
so
to
speak
of
the
sentencing
minutes,
and
i
would
point
out
that
mr.
chief
justice
that
mr.
rodka
begin
at
page
32
(a).
and
in
the
course
of
that
as
i
say
he
brings
in
a
number
of
things
which
were
completely
irrelevant
and
i
think
the
fact
that
he
adverts
to
organize
crime,
adverts
the
fact
that
this
man
had
allegedly
or
not
allegedly
but
had
been
previously
convicted
of
a
murder,
which
incidentally
as
i
understand
it
from
knowledge
of
the
co-defendant
in
that
same
case,
a
fellow
by
the
name
of
joseph
corbo
(ph),
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
had
declared
that
a
confession
in
the
corbo
case
had
been
involuntarily
obtained
and
it
is
my
understanding
that
santobello
also
reaped
the
benefit
of
that
because
although
not
for
that
he
would
still
be
in
jail.
he
was
apparently
given
time
served
and
got
out
after
11
or
12
years
of
that
sentence.
so
he
had
previously
been
the
victim
of
a
coerced
confession.
it
is
true
that
a
plea
of
guilty
may
not
be
an
extra
judicial
confession
but
it
is
nonetheless
an
ultimate
confession
of
guilt.
and
when
the
prosecutor
says
that
he
was
sophisticated,
he
maybe
correct
to
the
extent
the
he
knew
what
could
happen
to
him
because
he
had
been
formerly
victimized
as
the
victim
of
a
coerced
confession.
but
we
maintain
that
the
all
too
often
function
of
a
prosecutor,
who
perhaps
sometimes
is
carried
away
by
his
zeal
of
bringing
in
completely
irrelevant
inflammatory
and
prejudicial
matter
to
which
the
hapless
defendant
has
no
right
to
confront
witnesses,
cannot
come
forward
and
say
what
is
the
basis
for
these
allegations.
they
are
just
articulated
at
the
time
of
sentence
which
was
done
here
and
to
say
that
a
judge
can
sit
by
in
completely
without
being
affected
by
that,
i
say
is
a
mental
gymnastic
which
no
judge
in
the
world
or
very
few
judges
could
possibly
perform.
and
just
to
paraphrase
judge
hand
on
that.
and
we
maintain
that
is
a
serious
and
important
factor
in
this
case.
now,
in
addition
to
the
forgoing,
the
district
attorney
in
arguing
further
on
his
conception
of
functional
equivalency
states
that
we
really
should
look
into
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
this
man
received
a
fair
sentence.
and
with
all
due
respect
to
the
respondent
i
think
that
completely
misses
the
point
here.
we
are
dealing
now
with
a
concept
of
whether
or
not
the
representation
of
a
district
attorney,
a
public
prosecutor,
whether
or
not
it
is
malicious
or
innocent,
if
he
makes
a
representation
thus
he
have
a
right
to
break
that
representation
if
it
in
fact
induced
a
plea
of
guilty.
justice
gelanoff
permitted
no
hearing
on
this
issue
although
mr.
aronstein
said
that
a
trial
attorney
who
was
present
at
that
time
was
prepared
to
come
forward
and
testify
under
oath
that
such
a
promise
was
made
and
we
must
bear
in
mind
and
i
give
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
to
executive
assistant
rodka.
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
at
that
time
mr.
rodka
made
no
inquiry
of
anyone
as
to
whether
a
promise
in
fact
was
made.
he
merely
said
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
plea
minutes
indicated
was
made.
now,
that
frankly
from
an
experienced
prosecutor
is
a
very
amazing
statement
and
perhaps
this
court
should
be
oriented
to
the
extent
of
knowing
what
goes
on
at
a
plea
bargaining
session
which
perhaps
you
know
far
better
than
myself
but
at
a
plea
bargaining
session
unfortunately
there
is
a
certain
charade
that
is
put
on
and
i
do
not
think
that
my
colleague
would
can
test
this.
namely,
that
outside
the
presence
of
the
sentencing
judge
the
prosecutor
and
the
defense
counsel
get
together
and
perhaps
ask
each
other.
well,
how
can
we
resolve
this
case?
and
i
recognized
that
this
court
has
said
that
plea
bargaining
is
perfectly
proper
and
i
am
not
condemning
it
but
the
point
is
that
they
decide
that
this
case
can
be
resolved
by
offering
a
plea
of
guilty
to
a
misdemeanor
which
was
done
in
this
case.
but
no
attorney
worth
his
salt
who
is
experienced
in
the
criminal
field
and
mr.
aronstein
at
that
time
was
a
man
of
about
75
who
had
been
practicing
criminal
law
for
many,
many
years.
no
attorney
worth
his
salt
would
accept
a
plea
bargain
without
at
least
some
conception
as
what
the
possible
sentence
might
be.
now,
i
might
say
that
justice
marks
had
a
reputation
of
being
fairly
lenient
sentencer,
justice
gelanoff
has
the
contrary
reputation.
the
representation
was
elicited
from
assistant
district
attorney
greenfield
that
he
would
not
in
any
way
put
the
judge
so
to
speak
on
a
spot.
that
he
would
refrain
from
making
any
representation
whatsoever
or
recommendation
with
respect
to
sentence.
and
in
that
context
this
was
communicated
to
the
petitioner
and
that
is
the
reason
that
he
pled
guilty.
now,
you
may
wonder
why
was
it
that
this
was
not
put
on
the
record.
for
some
reason
it
is
almost
never
put
on
the
record.
i
might
point
out
also
that
in
the
elocution
at
the
time
of
plea,
now
plea
which
is
at
pages
19
and
20
particularly
of
the
joint
appendix.
for
some
reason,
and
perhaps
for
a
good
reason,
the
judge
justice
marks
did
not
ask
the
petitioner,
was
a
promise
made
to
you
which
is
very
unusual
in
new
york
plus
that
is
almost
always
asked.
in
this
case
it
was
not
asked.
so,
we
may
well
infer
that
even
the
judge
perhaps
was
aware
of
the
fact
that
a
promise
had
been
made.
now,
if
that
were
the
case,
of
course
it
would
merely
exacerbate
the
situation.
but
it
is
quite
contrary
to
usual
practice,
not
to
specifically
inquire
of
a
defendant
who
was
taking
a
plea
where
any
promises
made
to
you
or
any
threats
made
to
you.
in
this
case,
neither
of
those
two
questions
were
ever
put
to
santobello.
the
aba
standards
as
i
have
adverted
to
already
clearly
indicate
what
responsibilities
of
the
prosecutor
are.
those
aba
standards,
the
american
bar
association
standards
were
clearly
violated.
again,
i
face
into
argue
on
this.
i
am
not
alleging
malicious
violation
because
i
have
no
reason
for
believing
it
is
malicious.
particularly
in
view
of
mr.
sullivan’s
very
commendable
admission
that
the
promises
were
made.
but
i
do
think
the
damage
has
been
done
and
the
only
remedy
of
course,
we
would
maintain
would
be
the
remedy
of
permitting
a
withdrawal
of
the
plea
of
guilty
and
let
me
go
to
trial
on
the
felonies
and
if
he
is
convicted
of
the
felonies
and
serves
many
years.
well,
that
is
his
problem.
he
has
been
made
well
aware
of
these
facts.
mr.
irving
anolik
that
is
right.
mr.
irving
anolik
that
is
correct.
mr.
irving
anolik
two.
mr.
irving
anolik
that
is
correct
justice
stewart.
mr.
irving
anolik
no
they
were
not,
the
procedure
that
would
be
followed
with
a
plea
of
guilty
is
permitted
to
be
withdrawn,
is
that
the
felony
indictments
would
automatically
be
reinstated.
he
would
have
to
go
to
trial
on
the
felony
indictment
and
quite
sure
of
my
colleague
mr.
sullivan,
would
not
for
a
moment
deny
that
fact.
mr.
irving
anolik
there
would
be
no
double
jeopardy
in
my
opinion
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
think
that
he
is
bringing
this
proceeding
to
withdraw
the
plea
would
be
a
waiver
of
such
a
defense.
so
and
certainly
i
would
not
be
a
party
to
such
a
defense.
mr.
irving
anolik
no
question
about
it
if
there
should
be
a
reversal
and
that
permitting
him
re-plead.
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
question
about
that
justice
stewart.
mr.
irving
anolik
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
chief
justice
i
would
say
this.
perhaps
he
would
have
perhaps
he
would
not.
i
do
not
know.
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
the
judge
himself
of
course.
mr.
irving
anolik
yes
he
did.
he
could
have
give
him
a
suspended
sentence--
mr.
irving
anolik
anything
up
to
the
--
mr.
irving
anolik
that
is
true.
well,
i
think
though
chief
justice
that
you
are
addressing
yourself
to
the
fairness
of
the
sentence
and
we
may
--
mr.
irving
anolik
yes
i
realize
that.
mr.
irving
anolik
and
i
am
not
trying
to
avoid
the
question,
believe
me.
i
fully
recognize
the
problem
that
you
are
posing
mr.
chief
justice
but
it
would
appear
to
me
that
this
would
go
to
the
very
heart
of
the
plea
bargaining
process,
because
in
effect
it
would
be
establishing
the
precedent
that
a
prosecutor
could
violate
a
promise
and
as
long
as
the
sentencing
judge
said,
“well,
it
is
truly
violated
the
promise”
but
i
am
not
influenced
by
it
anyway.
i
am
going
to
give
him
this
maximum
sentence
anyway,
and
i
think
that
that
would
go
to
the
very
gut
of
the
plea
bargaining
process
and
render
it
a
mockery.
no
defendant
would
feel
safe
in
relying
upon
the
promise
of
a
prosecutor
again,
because
of
the
fact
that
he
would
know
that
the
prosecutor
could
deliberately
violate
it
knowing
that
if
he
were
lucky
enough
to
put
him
before
a
tough
judge
and
bear
in
mind
in
this
situation,
the
prosecutor
picks
the
judge.
when
the
judge
retires
that
the
calendar
procedure
in
new
york
county
and
i
believe
it
is
the
same
in
bronx
county
is
that
the
judges
are
selected
by
the
prosecutor.
they
are
not
automatically
picked
out
of
a
lot,
as
the
cases
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
so
it
is
quite
something
when
a
prosecutor
can
pick
out
a
judge
who
he
knows
is
tough
and
that
is
what
happened
in
this
case.
so
it
is
quite
something
to
consider.
mr.
irving
anolik
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
would
say
he
could
not
for
two
reasons.
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
as
they
say
theoretically
--
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
theoretically
it
is
possible,
chief
justice.
but
i
would
say
that
the
fact
is
that
the
promise
was
made
and
broken
and
this
defendant
relied
upon
the
promise.
now,
under
those
circumstances
it
would
establish
a
very
dangerous
precedent
the
plea
bargaining
system,
namely
that
a
prosecutor
can
--
mr.
irving
anolik
i
would
say
it
would
be
extremely
difficult
mr.
chief
justice
because
i
know
from
my
own
experiences,
the
case
has
received
a
great
deal
of
notoriety
in
new
york.
you
have
to
get
some
maybe
some
up
state
judge
or
something
and
i
think
that
in
itself
would
be
on
this
like
a
red
flag
that
there
is
something
bringing
in
the
judgment
different
area.
we
would
maintain
that
the
only
remedy
here
is
to
permit
him
to
withdraw
this
plea
and
re-plead.
and
we
also
question
whether
or
not
the
prosecutor
here,
if
he
wanted
to
be
fair,
why
did
he
not
once
found
out
of
this
come
into
court
as
the
american
bar
association
of
standards
4.3
require
and
join
an
emotion
to
permit
him
to
withdraw
and
indeed
the
fact
is
that
a
motion
to
suppress
was
made
is
given
great
import.
under
the
new
york
law,
813
(c)
of
the
code
of
our
procedure,
a
motion
to
suppress
maybe
made
consistently
with
the
plea
of
guilty,
it
survives
the
plea
of
guilty
and
in
fact
many
times
that
is
the
way
a
motion
of
suppress
is
crystallized.
so
there
is
nothing
inconsistent
whatsoever
with
having
made
a
motion
of
suppress.
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
if
a
consecutive
concurrent
from
this
--
mr.
irving
anolik
i
would
say
it,
i
believe
it
is
the
eight
years
all
together
i
believe,
it
would
be
eight
years,
that
would
be
the
theoretical
maximum
--
mr.
irving
anolik
yes.
and
i
think
that
certainly
if
he
were
completely
guilty,
he
would
be
out
of
his
mind
to
be
seeking
to
relief
which
he
has
directed
me
to
seek.
so
i
think
he
was
well
aware
of
the
exposure
he
has
here
and
nonetheless
he
has
asked
me
to
bring
this
petition
on
for
him
and
the
appellant's
counsel,
you
are
going
to
appreciate
and
we
are
urgently
asking
that
this
be
done
because
of
the
sentence
in
this
case
and
because
of
the
damage
that
would
do
to
entire
plea
bargaining
process
if
this
is
permitted
to
stand.
and
we
think
it
was
the
only
fair
thing
to
do
under
the
circumstances,
particularly
in
view
of
commendable
admission
that
the
promise
was
made
and
broken.
and
at
page
34
(a)
by
the
way,
off
the
record,
the
attorney
specifically
said.
now,
if
what
mr.
frukman
(ph)
as
the
trial
lawyer,
says
it
is
true
then
the
plea
was
obtained
by
flawed
interception
by
the
district
attorney,
it
was
obtained
on
the
express
promise
that
district
attorney
would
make
no
recommendations,
it
is
right
in
the
record,
justice
stewart,
the
fact
that,
that
was
called
for
the
attention
of
the
court.
thank
you
very
much,
thank
you.
mr.
irving
anolik
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
appeal
provision
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
york
which
affirmed
a
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
bronx
county
convicting
santobello,
the
petitioner
of
possession
of
gambling
records
in
the
second
degree
as
a
misdemeanor
upon
his
plea
of
guilty.
the
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
or
not
but
for
a
promise
--
mr.
irving
anolik
--
which
admittedly
was
articulated
by
the
assistant
district
attorney
to
refrain
from
any
recommendation
with
respect
to
sentence,
santobello
would
have
pled
guilty
in
the
first
place.
we
maintain
that
is
the
only
issue
before
this
court.
at
the
trial
level,
the
executive
assistant
mr.
rodka(ph)
when
asked
whether
or
not
a
promise
had
been
articulated.
that
is
when
he
was
asked
before
the
sentencing
judge
said
that
the
minutes
of
the
plea
did
not
reveal
any
such
promise.
although
he
had
been
personally
present
at
the
plea.
commendably,
mr.
sullivan
who
was
chief
of
the
appeals
bureau
of
that
office
inquired
of
assistant
district
attorney
greenfield
who
had
been
also
present
at
the
plea
of
guilty
with
mr.
rodka
and
he
notified
mr.
sullivan
that
such
a
promise
had
indeed
been
made.
and
that
in
the
briefs
before
this
court
as
they
were
before
the
appellate
division
of
the
supreme
court
of
new
york,
there
is
a
concession
that
the
promise
had
in
fact
been
made
and
broken.
we
respectfully
maintain
that
had
mr.
rodka,
the
executive
assistant,
told
justice
gelanoff
who
was
the
sentencing
judge
in
this
case
that
the
promise
in
fact
had
been
made.
one,
justice
gelanoff
probably
would
have
permitted
a
withdrawal
of
the
plea
of
guilty
or
two,
certainly
under
the
american
bar
associations
standards,
the
district
attorney
would
have
been
bound
to
have
assisted
the
defendant
in
withdrawing
his
plea
of
guilty.
instead
the
impression
was
left
with
justice
gelanoff
that
no
such
promise
had
been
made.
direct
application
on
appeal
was
more
solace
to
santobello.
now,
in
the
course
of
the
proceedings
--
mr.
irving
anolik
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
irving
anolik
that
is
correct
and
we
maintain
that
that
has
a
substantial
influence
contrary
to
my
illustrious
colleague
here,
we
maintain
that
as
a
substantial
influence
upon
a
sentencing
court.
in
their
brief
they
maintain
that
judges
are
never
influenced
by
recommendations
or
lack
of
recommendations
of
the
prosecutors.
mr.
irving
anolik
that
is
quite
true
justice
stewart
he
said
that.
but
we
maintain
that
what
he
said
and
the
consequences
of
what
he
did
are
quite
incompatible.
we
maintain
that
in
white
v.
gattney
(ph)
for
example
the
tenth
circuit
case
which
is
adverted
to,
that
there
too
the
judge,
said
he
is
not
a
listed
influence.
since
my
colleague
here
went
dehors
the
record
so
to
speak
in
saying
judges
are
never
influenced
and
incidentally,
he
is
my
successor
as
chief
of
the
appeals
bureau
on
that
office.
i
think
that
i
can
ask
this
court
to
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
judges
are
frequently
influenced
by
what
prosecutor’s
say.
so
to
say
that
it
was
diminished
or
that
the
judge
merely
by
articulating
that
he
was
not
influenced
is
of
no
solace
because
it
begs
the
question.
the
issue
here
is
not
whether
the
sentence
was
fair.
that
is
not
the
issue
at
all
but
that
seems
to
be
what
the
respondent
is
maintaining.
that
the
sentence
was
fair,
it
was
the
maximum
permitted
under
law
and
perhaps
it
was
fair.
but
that
is
not
the
issue.
mr.
irving
anolik
that
is
absolutely
correct
justice
stewart
and
that
is
our
position.
now
in
the
course
of
--
mr.
irving
anolik
no.
the
remedy
would
be
--
mr.
irving
anolik
because
the
--
well,
it
conceivably
could
be
the
delivery
of
the
promise
except
that
now
because
of
the
notoriety
which
this
case
has
achieved,
we
maintain
that
it
would
be
of
no
use.
this
case
is
extremely
well-known
now
in
bronx
county.
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
a
judge
certainly
can
be
assumed
to
make
a
decision
independently.
justice
gelanoff
if
no
articulation
of
a
promise
at
all
had
taken
place,
quite
possibly
might
have
given
the
year
sentence.
that
is
entirely
possible.
mr.
irving
anolik
that
is
what
he
said
at
the
time.
however
that
is
merely
speculation
because
--
mr.
irving
anolik
he
does
want
to
withdraw
his
plea.
that
is
exactly
what
he
wants
to
do
justice.
mr.
irving
anolik
that
is
correct
that
is
the
only
remedy
we
are
seeking
here
is
the
right
to
withdraw
his
plea
of
guilty
and
to
plead
new.
mr.
irving
anolik
that
i
realized.
but
by
the
same
token
it
would
be
the
only
fair
remedy
because
the
fact
remains
that
we
are
now
trying
to
undo
what
has
been
done
wrongly.
mr.
irving
anolik
that
is
correct
and
we
maintain
that
where
there
has
been
a
misrepresentation.
even
if
it
was
without
malicious
intent
and
we
are
not
alleging
maliciousness
here.
even
if
were
without
malicious
intent,
the
only
remedy
is
to
permit
the
withdrawal
of
the
plea
of
guilty.
and
that
is
--
mr.
irving
anolik
in
effect,
yes.
mr.
irving
anolik
yes.
mr.
irving
anolik
alright
and
i
recognized
that
the
possibility
of
that
interpret
--
we
are
not
asking
for
that
and
we
feel
under
the
circumstance
of
this
case
that
would
be
unfair.
because
you
could
not
undo
the
publicity
and
the
notoriety
that
has
taken
place
in
this
case.
mr.
irving
anolik
oh,
by
all
means.
the
reinstatement
of
the
felony
counts
would
certainly
follow
and
that
he
would
have
to
go
to
trial
and
face
the
possibility
of
a
number
of
years
in
jail.
we
well
recognize
that,
i
have
communicated
this
to
the
petitioner
and
he
is
willing
to
take
his
chances
on
that.
mr.
justice
blackmun
there
is
no
question
about
that
he
would
have
to
go
to
trial
on
the
original
felony
counts.
mr.
irving
anolik
no.
well
i
want
to
make
that
quite
sure
that
i
am
not
asking
that
he
be
permitted
to
go
to
trial
in
the
misdemeanor.
that
would
be
totally
unfair
and
i
am
not
trying
to
advocate
such
a
procedure
at
all
justice
blackmun.
the
prosecutor
in
his
brief,
the
respondent’s
brief
indicates
that
during
the
course
of
these
proceedings
and
perhaps
i
should
take
one
moment
just
to
give
you
the
chronology
of
what
occurred
here.
that
the
defendant
here
been
indicted
for
two
felonies
involving
gambling.
he
had
made
a
motion
to
suppress
evidence
returnable
june
17th,
1969.
on
june
16th,
1969,
a
day
before
the
return
day
of
that
motion
he
interposed
a
plea
of
guilty
to
the
misdemeanor
before
justice
marks.
on
the
17th
the
motion
to
suppress
evidence
was
apparently
adjourned
without
any
disposition.
a
lawyer
by
the
name
of
fructman(ph)
represented
the
defendant
during
these
times.
subsequently,
i
believe
it
was
on
september
or
october
of
1969,
a
different
lawyer
by
the
name
of
garanstein(ph)
was
retained
by
the
petitioner
here
in.
and
he
then
apparently
tried
to
revive
the
crescent
or
dormant
motion
to
suppress.
and
in
the
course
of
doing
that
he
indicated
that
this
petitioner
was
unaware
of
certain
rights
which
apparently
was
an
incorrect
statement.
now,
if
there
had
been
an
issue
of
credibility
as
to
whether
or
not
a
promise
had
been
made
or
if
there
had
not
been
a
concession
that
the
promise
had
been
and
broken
then
this
factor
would
be
significant
in
judging
the
credibility
of
the
petitioner.
and
we
maintain
that
bringing
this
issue
out
is
irrelevant
completely.
because
it
begs
the
question
here
namely
that
whether
or
not
the
credibility
of
the
petitioner
is
good
or
bad
after
as
to
a
collateral
issue,
the
fact
remains
that
by
concession,
this
issue
was
crystallized
namely
if
the
promise
was
made
and
broken.
so
to
that
extent
will
you
just
wish
to
distinguish
that
from
the
brief
of
the
respondent.
we
also
maintain
that
in
this
case
the
district
attorney
says,
well
this
defendant
has
never
indicated
that
he
was
innocent.
well,
in
our
brief
of
course
we
say
that
he
is
so
maintaining
but
if
we
look
at
what
he
was
trying
to
do
and
i
think
mr.
justice
blackmun
put
his
finger
on
it.
here
is
the
defendant
who
is
asking
that
he
be
put
back
instead
in
status
quo
anti.
they
would
be
permitted
to
withdraw
this
plea
of
guilty
and
go
to
trial
under
felonies.
well,
obviously
if
you
were
guilty
and
felt
that
he
would
certainly
be
convicted.
i
doubt
that
he
would
seek
such
a
remedy.
so
i
think
that
certainly,
circumstantially
and
inferentially
he
clearly
indicates
and
has
always
indicated
that
he
is
innocent
and
i
think
that
too
is
an
irrelevant
aspect
of
this
case
because
the
petitioner
has
made
no
doubt
whatsoever
as
to
what
he
is
seeking
here
and
no
more
and
no
less
of
course.
at
the
time
of
the
sentencing,
i
might
point
out
most
respectfully
to
your
honors
that
the
sentencing
minutes
begin
at
page
21
(a)
of
the
joint
appendix
inadvertently,
it
seems
that
the
printer
calling
it
plea.
the
sentence
begins
at
21
(a)
of
the
joint
appendix.
now,
at
the
time
of
the
sentencing
here
which
incidentally
came
on
before
a
different
justice
than
the
justice
who
accepted
the
plea
of
the
guilty,
justice
marks
as
i
had
indicated
accepted
the
plea
of
guilty.
he
had
retired
at
the
end
of
1969
and
he
then
apparently
was
superseded
in
the
capacity
of
sentencing
judge
anyway
by
justice
gelanoff.
the
district
attorney
argues
in
his
briefs
and
there
is
no
basis
in
the
record
for
this
incidentally
but
he
contends
in
his
brief
that
santobello
received
the
functional
equivalency
of
his
promise.
now
i
frankly
fail
to
follow
that
line
of
reasoning
and
i
believe
that
it
is
a
casuistic
line
of
reasoning.
because
there
was
no
functional
equivalency
here,
he
said
that
after
all,
the
respondent
says
after
all
justice
gelanoff
said
that
he
did
not
really
pay
any
attention
to
the
prosecutor.
now,
we
have
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
prosecutor
here
who
was
the
executive
assistant.
i
think
second
or
third
in
command
of
that
office
came
in
and
made
an
impassioned
plea
for
the
maximum
possible
sentence
under
the
law,
adverting
to
merits
clearly
dehors
the
record
conceiving
in
the
record
that
he
did
not
know
what
the
probation
report
contained.
linking
this
defendant
with
organized
crime
whether
or
not
there
is
such
a
thing
that
probation
report,
i
do
not
know
because
i
have
not
seen
it.
mr.
irving
anolik
oh
yes.
yes
at
page
--
mr.
irving
anolik
yes
but
at
page
33,
34
and
35,
i
think
you
will
find
that
mr.
chief
justice.
and
i
think
that
that
is
very
significant
because
after
all
we
are
not
just
dealing
with
a
simple
articulation
of
a
statement.
at
page
38,
the
actual
or
the
word
arraign
him
for
sentence
appear.
so
from
21
to
30
(a)
are
just
preliminaries
although
it
is
a
part
of
a
sentencing
minutes.
but
at
30
(a)
begins
the
actual
meet
so
to
speak
of
the
sentencing
minutes,
and
i
would
point
out
that
mr.
chief
justice
that
mr.
rodka
begin
at
page
32
(a).
and
in
the
course
of
that
as
i
say
he
brings
in
a
number
of
things
which
were
completely
irrelevant
and
i
think
the
fact
that
he
adverts
to
organize
crime,
adverts
the
fact
that
this
man
had
allegedly
or
not
allegedly
but
had
been
previously
convicted
of
a
murder,
which
incidentally
as
i
understand
it
from
knowledge
of
the
co-defendant
in
that
same
case,
a
fellow
by
the
name
of
joseph
corbo
(ph),
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
had
declared
that
a
confession
in
the
corbo
case
had
been
involuntarily
obtained
and
it
is
my
understanding
that
santobello
also
reaped
the
benefit
of
that
because
although
not
for
that
he
would
still
be
in
jail.
he
was
apparently
given
time
served
and
got
out
after
11
or
12
years
of
that
sentence.
so
he
had
previously
been
the
victim
of
a
coerced
confession.
it
is
true
that
a
plea
of
guilty
may
not
be
an
extra
judicial
confession
but
it
is
nonetheless
an
ultimate
confession
of
guilt.
and
when
the
prosecutor
says
that
he
was
sophisticated,
he
maybe
correct
to
the
extent
the
he
knew
what
could
happen
to
him
because
he
had
been
formerly
victimized
as
the
victim
of
a
coerced
confession.
but
we
maintain
that
the
all
too
often
function
of
a
prosecutor,
who
perhaps
sometimes
is
carried
away
by
his
zeal
of
bringing
in
completely
irrelevant
inflammatory
and
prejudicial
matter
to
which
the
hapless
defendant
has
no
right
to
confront
witnesses,
cannot
come
forward
and
say
what
is
the
basis
for
these
allegations.
they
are
just
articulated
at
the
time
of
sentence
which
was
done
here
and
to
say
that
a
judge
can
sit
by
in
completely
without
being
affected
by
that,
i
say
is
a
mental
gymnastic
which
no
judge
in
the
world
or
very
few
judges
could
possibly
perform.
and
just
to
paraphrase
judge
hand
on
that.
and
we
maintain
that
is
a
serious
and
important
factor
in
this
case.
now,
in
addition
to
the
forgoing,
the
district
attorney
in
arguing
further
on
his
conception
of
functional
equivalency
states
that
we
really
should
look
into
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
this
man
received
a
fair
sentence.
and
with
all
due
respect
to
the
respondent
i
think
that
completely
misses
the
point
here.
we
are
dealing
now
with
a
concept
of
whether
or
not
the
representation
of
a
district
attorney,
a
public
prosecutor,
whether
or
not
it
is
malicious
or
innocent,
if
he
makes
a
representation
thus
he
have
a
right
to
break
that
representation
if
it
in
fact
induced
a
plea
of
guilty.
justice
gelanoff
permitted
no
hearing
on
this
issue
although
mr.
aronstein
said
that
a
trial
attorney
who
was
present
at
that
time
was
prepared
to
come
forward
and
testify
under
oath
that
such
a
promise
was
made
and
we
must
bear
in
mind
and
i
give
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
to
executive
assistant
rodka.
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
at
that
time
mr.
rodka
made
no
inquiry
of
anyone
as
to
whether
a
promise
in
fact
was
made.
he
merely
said
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
plea
minutes
indicated
was
made.
now,
that
frankly
from
an
experienced
prosecutor
is
a
very
amazing
statement
and
perhaps
this
court
should
be
oriented
to
the
extent
of
knowing
what
goes
on
at
a
plea
bargaining
session
which
perhaps
you
know
far
better
than
myself
but
at
a
plea
bargaining
session
unfortunately
there
is
a
certain
charade
that
is
put
on
and
i
do
not
think
that
my
colleague
would
can
test
this.
namely,
that
outside
the
presence
of
the
sentencing
judge
the
prosecutor
and
the
defense
counsel
get
together
and
perhaps
ask
each
other.
well,
how
can
we
resolve
this
case?
and
i
recognized
that
this
court
has
said
that
plea
bargaining
is
perfectly
proper
and
i
am
not
condemning
it
but
the
point
is
that
they
decide
that
this
case
can
be
resolved
by
offering
a
plea
of
guilty
to
a
misdemeanor
which
was
done
in
this
case.
but
no
attorney
worth
his
salt
who
is
experienced
in
the
criminal
field
and
mr.
aronstein
at
that
time
was
a
man
of
about
75
who
had
been
practicing
criminal
law
for
many,
many
years.
no
attorney
worth
his
salt
would
accept
a
plea
bargain
without
at
least
some
conception
as
what
the
possible
sentence
might
be.
now,
i
might
say
that
justice
marks
had
a
reputation
of
being
fairly
lenient
sentencer,
justice
gelanoff
has
the
contrary
reputation.
the
representation
was
elicited
from
assistant
district
attorney
greenfield
that
he
would
not
in
any
way
put
the
judge
so
to
speak
on
a
spot.
that
he
would
refrain
from
making
any
representation
whatsoever
or
recommendation
with
respect
to
sentence.
and
in
that
context
this
was
communicated
to
the
petitioner
and
that
is
the
reason
that
he
pled
guilty.
now,
you
may
wonder
why
was
it
that
this
was
not
put
on
the
record.
for
some
reason
it
is
almost
never
put
on
the
record.
i
might
point
out
also
that
in
the
elocution
at
the
time
of
plea,
now
plea
which
is
at
pages
19
and
20
particularly
of
the
joint
appendix.
for
some
reason,
and
perhaps
for
a
good
reason,
the
judge
justice
marks
did
not
ask
the
petitioner,
was
a
promise
made
to
you
which
is
very
unusual
in
new
york
plus
that
is
almost
always
asked.
in
this
case
it
was
not
asked.
so,
we
may
well
infer
that
even
the
judge
perhaps
was
aware
of
the
fact
that
a
promise
had
been
made.
now,
if
that
were
the
case,
of
course
it
would
merely
exacerbate
the
situation.
but
it
is
quite
contrary
to
usual
practice,
not
to
specifically
inquire
of
a
defendant
who
was
taking
a
plea
where
any
promises
made
to
you
or
any
threats
made
to
you.
in
this
case,
neither
of
those
two
questions
were
ever
put
to
santobello.
the
aba
standards
as
i
have
adverted
to
already
clearly
indicate
what
responsibilities
of
the
prosecutor
are.
those
aba
standards,
the
american
bar
association
standards
were
clearly
violated.
again,
i
face
into
argue
on
this.
i
am
not
alleging
malicious
violation
because
i
have
no
reason
for
believing
it
is
malicious.
particularly
in
view
of
mr.
sullivan’s
very
commendable
admission
that
the
promises
were
made.
but
i
do
think
the
damage
has
been
done
and
the
only
remedy
of
course,
we
would
maintain
would
be
the
remedy
of
permitting
a
withdrawal
of
the
plea
of
guilty
and
let
me
go
to
trial
on
the
felonies
and
if
he
is
convicted
of
the
felonies
and
serves
many
years.
well,
that
is
his
problem.
he
has
been
made
well
aware
of
these
facts.
mr.
irving
anolik
that
is
right.
mr.
irving
anolik
that
is
correct.
mr.
irving
anolik
two.
mr.
irving
anolik
that
is
correct
justice
stewart.
mr.
irving
anolik
no
they
were
not,
the
procedure
that
would
be
followed
with
a
plea
of
guilty
is
permitted
to
be
withdrawn,
is
that
the
felony
indictments
would
automatically
be
reinstated.
he
would
have
to
go
to
trial
on
the
felony
indictment
and
quite
sure
of
my
colleague
mr.
sullivan,
would
not
for
a
moment
deny
that
fact.
mr.
irving
anolik
there
would
be
no
double
jeopardy
in
my
opinion
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
think
that
he
is
bringing
this
proceeding
to
withdraw
the
plea
would
be
a
waiver
of
such
a
defense.
so
and
certainly
i
would
not
be
a
party
to
such
a
defense.
mr.
irving
anolik
no
question
about
it
if
there
should
be
a
reversal
and
that
permitting
him
re-plead.
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
question
about
that
justice
stewart.
mr.
irving
anolik
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
chief
justice
i
would
say
this.
perhaps
he
would
have
perhaps
he
would
not.
i
do
not
know.
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
the
judge
himself
of
course.
mr.
irving
anolik
yes
he
did.
he
could
have
give
him
a
suspended
sentence--
mr.
irving
anolik
anything
up
to
the
--
mr.
irving
anolik
that
is
true.
well,
i
think
though
chief
justice
that
you
are
addressing
yourself
to
the
fairness
of
the
sentence
and
we
may
--
mr.
irving
anolik
yes
i
realize
that.
mr.
irving
anolik
and
i
am
not
trying
to
avoid
the
question,
believe
me.
i
fully
recognize
the
problem
that
you
are
posing
mr.
chief
justice
but
it
would
appear
to
me
that
this
would
go
to
the
very
heart
of
the
plea
bargaining
process,
because
in
effect
it
would
be
establishing
the
precedent
that
a
prosecutor
could
violate
a
promise
and
as
long
as
the
sentencing
judge
said,
“well,
it
is
truly
violated
the
promise”
but
i
am
not
influenced
by
it
anyway.
i
am
going
to
give
him
this
maximum
sentence
anyway,
and
i
think
that
that
would
go
to
the
very
gut
of
the
plea
bargaining
process
and
render
it
a
mockery.
no
defendant
would
feel
safe
in
relying
upon
the
promise
of
a
prosecutor
again,
because
of
the
fact
that
he
would
know
that
the
prosecutor
could
deliberately
violate
it
knowing
that
if
he
were
lucky
enough
to
put
him
before
a
tough
judge
and
bear
in
mind
in
this
situation,
the
prosecutor
picks
the
judge.
when
the
judge
retires
that
the
calendar
procedure
in
new
york
county
and
i
believe
it
is
the
same
in
bronx
county
is
that
the
judges
are
selected
by
the
prosecutor.
they
are
not
automatically
picked
out
of
a
lot,
as
the
cases
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
so
it
is
quite
something
when
a
prosecutor
can
pick
out
a
judge
who
he
knows
is
tough
and
that
is
what
happened
in
this
case.
so
it
is
quite
something
to
consider.
mr.
irving
anolik
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
would
say
he
could
not
for
two
reasons.
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
as
they
say
theoretically
--
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
theoretically
it
is
possible,
chief
justice.
but
i
would
say
that
the
fact
is
that
the
promise
was
made
and
broken
and
this
defendant
relied
upon
the
promise.
now,
under
those
circumstances
it
would
establish
a
very
dangerous
precedent
the
plea
bargaining
system,
namely
that
a
prosecutor
can
--
mr.
irving
anolik
i
would
say
it
would
be
extremely
difficult
mr.
chief
justice
because
i
know
from
my
own
experiences,
the
case
has
received
a
great
deal
of
notoriety
in
new
york.
you
have
to
get
some
maybe
some
up
state
judge
or
something
and
i
think
that
in
itself
would
be
on
this
like
a
red
flag
that
there
is
something
bringing
in
the
judgment
different
area.
we
would
maintain
that
the
only
remedy
here
is
to
permit
him
to
withdraw
this
plea
and
re-plead.
and
we
also
question
whether
or
not
the
prosecutor
here,
if
he
wanted
to
be
fair,
why
did
he
not
once
found
out
of
this
come
into
court
as
the
american
bar
association
of
standards
4.3
require
and
join
an
emotion
to
permit
him
to
withdraw
and
indeed
the
fact
is
that
a
motion
to
suppress
was
made
is
given
great
import.
under
the
new
york
law,
813
(c)
of
the
code
of
our
procedure,
a
motion
to
suppress
maybe
made
consistently
with
the
plea
of
guilty,
it
survives
the
plea
of
guilty
and
in
fact
many
times
that
is
the
way
a
motion
of
suppress
is
crystallized.
so
there
is
nothing
inconsistent
whatsoever
with
having
made
a
motion
of
suppress.
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
if
a
consecutive
concurrent
from
this
--
mr.
irving
anolik
i
would
say
it,
i
believe
it
is
the
eight
years
all
together
i
believe,
it
would
be
eight
years,
that
would
be
the
theoretical
maximum
--
mr.
irving
anolik
yes.
and
i
think
that
certainly
if
he
were
completely
guilty,
he
would
be
out
of
his
mind
to
be
seeking
to
relief
which
he
has
directed
me
to
seek.
so
i
think
he
was
well
aware
of
the
exposure
he
has
here
and
nonetheless
he
has
asked
me
to
bring
this
petition
on
for
him
and
the
appellant's
counsel,
you
are
going
to
appreciate
and
we
are
urgently
asking
that
this
be
done
because
of
the
sentence
in
this
case
and
because
of
the
damage
that
would
do
to
entire
plea
bargaining
process
if
this
is
permitted
to
stand.
and
we
think
it
was
the
only
fair
thing
to
do
under
the
circumstances,
particularly
in
view
of
commendable
admission
that
the
promise
was
made
and
broken.
and
at
page
34
(a)
by
the
way,
off
the
record,
the
attorney
specifically
said.
now,
if
what
mr.
frukman
(ph)
as
the
trial
lawyer,
says
it
is
true
then
the
plea
was
obtained
by
flawed
interception
by
the
district
attorney,
it
was
obtained
on
the
express
promise
that
district
attorney
would
make
no
recommendations,
it
is
right
in
the
record,
justice
stewart,
the
fact
that,
that
was
called
for
the
attention
of
the
court.
thank
you
very
much,
thank
you.
