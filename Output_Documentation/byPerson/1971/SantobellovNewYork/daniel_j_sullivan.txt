mr.
daniel
j.
sullivan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
know
of
course
that
this
tribunal
will
look
at
my
briefs
or
statement
of
the
legal
position,
i
have
taken
because
as
yet
i
have
not
heard
it
articulated.
alright,
perhaps
more
importantly,
i
have
not
really
heard
much
that
resembles
the
factually
the
case
of
santobello
against
new
york
and
i
propose
(inaudible)
specific
case.
now,
to
begin
with
counsel
seemed
to
had
some
difficulty
in
focusing
on
just
what
the
legal
question
is
here.
we
are
not
accused
of
trying
to
overreach
as
such
in
this
case,
the
fact
is
this
record
will
demonstrate
that
we
do
not
have
a
prosecutorial
misconduct
case
at
all.
there
is
no
proof
on
this
record
of
any
bad
faith
on
bar.
it
has
been
disclosed
to
the
court
that
when
time
permitted
and
we
became
aware
of
it,
well,
we
disclosed
the
true
fact
here.
now,
the
legal
question
that
i
do
see
here
is
one
of
reviewing
the
exercise
of
judicial
discretion.
in
other
words,
the
judge
at
the
sentencing
level
being
asked
for
permission
to
withdraw
the
plea.
he
acts
decently
in
this
situation
finding
out
now,
where
he
sentenced
the
petitioner
that
perhaps
such
a
promise
has
been
made.
now,
i
will
come
back
hopefully
to
that
in
a
moment.
there
is
more
in
this
record
than
even
the
sentencing
judge
was
aware.
like,
i
am
aware
of
the
powers
of
this
court
to
review
the
record
in
this
in
entirely
and
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
if
you
look
at
this
record,
one
thing
will
become
crystal
clear
that
this
whole
claim
by
the
petitioner
can
be
fairly
rendered
a
sham.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
there
was
never
a
viable
sentence
agreement,
we
can
analogize
the
contract
law.
in
other
words,
santobello
just
never
put
any
stock
in
this
representation.
you
recall
how
it
came
up.
one
assistant
district
attorney
tells
us
before
his
counsel.
the
prosecutor
would
remain
partisan
at
the
time
of
sentence.
petitioner
is
given
a
misdemeanor
plea,
go
ahead
into
the
future,
a
different
assistant
is
in
the
bar
and
he
asked
for
a
maximum
sentence.
in
this
case,
it
was
a
year.
now,
in
support
of
my
claim
and
i
say
the
record
demonstrates,
that
this
i
think
would
fairly
be
called
a
sham
claim.
i
call
the
court’s
attention
in
several
facts.
from
santobello's
perspective,
he
himself
reports
with
his
prior
murder
conviction
and
all
was
no
reign
on
in
the
courts.
he
knew
certainly
that
judges
control
sentences
and
there
was
no
a
judge
privy
to
any
of
the
promises
made
here.
i
have
spoken
already
about
the
limited
scope,
then
the
nature
of
the
promise
itself
i
think
has
a
relevance
here
when
the
man
hopes
that
a
prosecutor
will
remain
partisan
at
the
time
of
sentence.
he
is
not
really
opting
for
much
in
this
situation.
it
is
more,
i
would
suggest
in
expectancy
or
a
hope
really
what
one
might
call
a
promise
and
i
have
referred
in
my
brief
to
several
cases
on
that
score.
mr.
daniel
j.
sullivan
yes
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
is
my
doubt.
i
came
up
on
appeal.
the
claim
was
made
in
the
appellate
division,
so
what
happened
simply
that
call
of
follow
up
that
was
named
or
recorded
asked
him
if
you
made
those
promises,
he
said
yes,
so
it
is
closing.
mr.
daniel
j.
sullivan
pardon
me?
mr.
daniel
j.
sullivan
no.
but
i
am
willing
to
concede
that
the
promise
was
made
before
the
man
pleaded.
i
know
that
to
be
the
fact
that
as
--
say
i
think
in
this
area
i
can
certainly
make
the
confession.
now,
in
short,
the
way
i
got
it
was
that
counsel
said
that
was
you
would
not
ask
or
anything
at
the
time
of
sentencing
and
the
assistant
said
“no,
i
would
not”.
that
is
assistant
a
and
then
of
course
b
comes
in
to
the
picture
at
the
actual
time
of
sentence.
mr.
daniel
j.
sullivan
we
do
not
mr.
justice
stewart,
no.
mr.
daniel
j.
sullivan
well,
then
the
problem
there
was
in
the
review
of
the
record
whether
we
should
make
it
in
session
or
whether
on
balance,
at
least
in
our
view,
we
felt
that
the
man
had
not
been
overreached
and
thus
proceeding,
and
so
that
that
is
on
34
(a)
of
the
appellant's
appendix.
now,
while
characterizing
the
petitioner
here,
i
think
i
may
fairly
say
on
this
record
that
he
was
engaged
in
judge
shopping
here.
you
have
heard
reference
made
to
justice
marks
being
lenient
in
his
sentences
and
that
he
had
but
one
intendment
to
this
petitioner,
that
says
out
of
jail.
alright,
and
i
suggested
to
the
court
that
perhaps
that
is
the
same
kind
of
thread
running
through
this
case
right
up
until
now
despite
the
pro-rata
respecting,
having
to
face
future
charges.
who
knows
what
the
future
will
bring?
but
i
propose
of
what
i
am
saying
here
that
this
was
judge
shopping
in
effort
to
stay
out
of
jail,
you
will
find
that
the
record
indicates
that
santobello’s
first
action
in
this
case
was
to
move
to
suppress
the
tangible
evidence
that
had
been
found
on
its
presence.
now,
it
predates
that
several
months
until
justice
marks,
who
usually
is
in
new
york
county,
up
into
bronx.
as
it
happens
he
takes
the
plea
before
justice
marks.
now,
he
withdraws
that
motion,
alright?
we
never
have
a
point
in
this
case
again
in
which
there
is
any
claim
of
innocence
which
has
a
very
important
bearing
under
the
law
of
new
york
state
because
if
a
man
made
such
a
claim
prior
to
the
actual
pronouncement
of
sentence
or
laws,
is
pretty
much
if
you
have
to
do
something
about
it,
you
have
to
let
him
vacate
or
at
least
to
have
a
hearing.
so
now,
i
said
that
is
an
indication
that
he
picked
this
judge,
and
looked
like
he
was
going
along,
alright.
the
judge
will
order
the
probation
report.
now
wanting
to
adjourn
date
before
justice
marks
with
no
preliminaries,
no
reported
preliminaries.
justice
marks
gets
up
and
says,
in
the
record,
one
line.
in
view
of
the
probation
report
i
am
putting
in
this
case
over.
and
i
say
that
is
an
artilerry
of
things
to
come,
that
a
justice
armed
with
a
full
probation
report,
now
knows
the
background
and
santobello
knows
the
background.
in
short,
there
is
very
little
hope
even
before
justice
marks.
so
what
happens?
a
week
goes
by,
we
have
a
change
and
the
defense
waives,
incomes
santobello
the
petitioner
would
have
battery
emotions
now.
one
of
which
is
to
withdraw
the
plea
of
guilty.
in
it,
among
other
things
he
squares
in
an
affidavit,
hey,
you
did
not
know,
we
had
a
right
to
move
to
suppress.
the
fact
being
he
already
put
in
a
small
affidavit,
abandon
that
claim.
we
submit
to
the
court
as
evidence,
the
conduct
of
this
man
to
be
taken
as
prima-facie
evidence
of
perjury
and
more
important
in
this
context
of
the
fact
that
what
was
happening
here
was
santobello,
the
petitioner
was
trying
to
dupe
the
courts
of
new
york
state,
and
this
case
really
is
the
other
way
around.
mr.
daniel
j.
sullivan
dupe.
in
other
words,
i
am
suggesting
to
this
court
and
on
this
record,
you
may
conclude
that
you
are
going
to
probably
ensure
what
coming
in
here.
looking
for
every
advantage,
not
at
all
concerned
with
the
claim
of
innocence,
that
was
no
where
in
this
case,
i
can
hear
it
now,
first
time.
all
he
wants
to
do
is
walk
away,
avoid
incarceration,
watch
another
mark,
given
his
particular
background.
mr.
daniel
j.
sullivan
oh,
i
think
the
matter,
he
got
out
on
post
conviction,
bail
application
mr.
chief
justice.
now,
again
now
as
i
say,
that
sentencing
over
the
case,
that
particular
affidavit
which
is
fairly
susceptible
of
characterization
as
precarious
and
somehow
disappeared
from
new
york
to
files
in
new
york
supreme
court.
well,
in
any
event
now,
we
react
to
base,
a
suppression
motion
in
conjunction
with
this
effort
to
withdraw
his
plea.
additionally
as
i
say
he
does
not
trigger
the
new
york
law
by
making
a
claim
of
innocence.
at
that
time,
we
offered
him
a
hearing.
as
it
turned
and
particularly
as
we
put
in
our
own
opposing
phase,
it
was
to
challenge
this
assertion
about
how
active
knowledge
of
constitutional
right.
however,
judge
marks
decided
that
we
did
not
need
that
hearing
and
he
puts
the
case
over.
now,
this
truly
came
on
before
justice
gelanoff
and
on
this
record,
i
do
not
know
myself
in
this
record
would
not
tell
you
how
it
got
before
for
him,
characterization
is
that
he
is
a
tough
sentencing
judge.
i
have
made
clear,
i
do
not
see
that
there
is
any
way
that
can
be
determined
on
this
record
but
what
can
be
--
mr.
daniel
j.
sullivan
he
did
mr.
justice
stewart
but
we
come
again
to
this
probation
report
which
is
before
to
the
court
and
i
am
going
to
suggest
shortly,
that
really
there
is
no
alternative.
i
do
not
know
if
santobello
knows.
now,
the
sentencing
proceeding
itself
was
marked
by
the
effort
by
the
attorney
aronstein,
that
to
stole
again,
keep
this
man
out
of
jail.
and
if
you
will
find
it,
it
is
clear
in
the
record,
he
starts
involving
some
things
about
prior
motions
and
about
some
comment
of
one
he
did
not
now,
what
had
happened
when
he
has
been
in
the
part
and
had
been
ruling
--
i
do
not
know,
bogged
down
on
that.
i
think
the
fair
characterization
of
this
episode
is
that
his
last
big
stand
was
to
stay
out
of
jail.
now,
never
was
there
a
formal
motion.
what
happened
was
this,
the
man
will
sentenced
santobello,
counsel
aronstein
and
then
brought
up
the
subject
of
this
prior
promise.
and
that
happened
very
quickly
now.
the
prosecutor
in
the
bar
said
something
about
it
not
being
reflected
in
the
minutes
but
the
prosecution
for
the
defense
for
that
matter
really
did
not
get
an
opportunity
to
dwell
on
this
subject
to
go
into
evidence
because
the
judge
took
over.
so
there
is
no
opportunity
to
do
anymore
even
if
we
want
to
do.
and
what
the
judge
said
in
essence
was
a
promise
or
not,
i
would
not
be
affected
because
i
have
got
an
overriding
probationary
report.
i
would
have
no
alternative
when
he
was
silent,
you
ask
for
the
maximum.
there
is
only
one
thing
i
can
do,
here
is
a
quoted
portion
in
the
record
of
the
probation
report
which
is
a
plea
to
remove
this
man
from
the
streets
and
this
court
now
has
a
full
probation
report
and
of
course,
would
be
better
positioned
to
make
an
analysis
of
the
propriety
of
that
decision
which
as
i
see
it
is
the
question
in
this
case.
usually
this
kind
of
thing
comes
up
in
the
collateral
post-conviction
application.
what
is
happened
here
of
course
is
the
sentencing
judge
was
(inaudible).
now,
there
is
a
tenth
circuit
case
that
(inaudible)
referred
to
in
which
kansas
went
along
much
the
way
i
have
been
speaking
in
tenth
circuit
vacated
judgment.
on
the
reasoning
that
i
have
some
difficulty
coping
with.
however,
kansas
approached
that
this
is
a
matter
of
the
exercise
of
the
judicial
discretion.
the
case
involved
however
a
license
without
over
parole
and
while
we
will
never
know,
the
point
is
that
the
case
was
vacated
and
as
the
reason
is
not
clear.
they
talk
in
terms
of
the
effectiveness
of
the
promise,
i
do
not
see
really
what
difference
that
would
make
because,
had
we
got
ahead
and
remained
partisan,
he
got
no
benefit
from
it.
esthetically,
then
of
course
we
would
have
gotten,
well
he
opted
for
a
bargain
for
and
that
is
what
i
say
essentially
happened
here.
the
judge
is
not
privy
to
it,
he
is
apprised
of
what
happened.
but
the
judge
has
positioned
himself
that
there
is
nothing
else
he
can
do
about
it.
your
honor
i
think
the
biggest
difference
between
this
case
and
white
and
all
is
there
is
no
proof
of
reliance,
whatsoever
in
this
case.
as
i
have
said
before
that
has
been
suggested
here
that
in
reliance
upon
this
assertion,
a
promise
to
remain
partisan
that
santobello
took
the
plea.
you
would
not
find
that
record
at
all
and
if
we
were
even
to
assume,
this
court
will
exercise
its
powers
over
the
facts
that
if
santobello
recalled
that
hearing
and
i
do
not
see
that
it
would
be
necessary
and
we
assume
that
he
testified
it
and
relied
on
it,
well
that
is
a
fact
or
not.
you
have
enough
record
evidence
here.
taking
a
broader
view
of
the
record
to
reject
that
claim
and
in
constitutional
terms,
in
the
narrower
case
if
we
reject
that
argument,
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
he
did
not
in
fact
get
what
i
call
the
functional
equivalency.
certainly,
the
man
has
been
promised
something,
we
have
to
leave
up,
it
would
not
be
here.
mr.
daniel
j.
sullivan
mr.
justice
marshall
yes,
i
say
that
you
will
--
mr.
daniel
j.
sullivan
that
he
might
the
way
--
i
think
he
would
have
gone
--
mr.
daniel
j.
sullivan
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
j.
sullivan
mr.
justice
marshall
i
think
he
could,
they
could
have
stopped.
he
could
have
checked
in.
i
will
read
this
record
and
certainly
there
is
no
indication,
he
knew
what
the
other
fellow
had
done
you
see,
and
as
l
say
that
was
very
quick,
the
whole
thing
you
will
see,
a
line
or
two
in
the
record
and
it
is
over.
mr.
daniel
j.
sullivan
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
do
not
know
why
is
that,
i
think
myself
that.
that
would
have
been
the
case
but
i
am
focusing
on
what
i
believe
to
be
the
legal
question.
mr.
daniel
j.
sullivan
it
is
difficult,
that
is
true
that
this
is
not
the
conventional
type
record
that
comes
up.
what
we
are
trying,
i
submit
respectively
to
assess
is
the
exercise
of
discretion
by
the
sentencing
judge,
that
is
what
is
reviewable
here
and
given
what
i
do
know
if
by
way
of
record
indications
here.
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
exercise
of
that
discretion
cannot
be
forbid
and
in
this
context
that
the
judge
is
going
ahead
in
this
fashion
did
not
deprive
the
petitioner
of
his
constitutional
rights.
mr.
daniel
j.
sullivan
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
feel
it
will
yes.
mr.
daniel
j.
sullivan
no,
mr.
justice.
may
come
to
state
law
and
we
have
cases
on
that,
that
would
have
been
so.
may
i
suggest
mr.
justice
blackmun
that
you
have
virtually
argued
ever
get
in
a
hearing
of
any
kind
presently
in
the
record.
i
think
all
i
can
imagine
i
could
be
at
it
would
be
an
assertion
why
santobello
that
he
relied
upon
this
representation
and
i
just
cannot
imagine
what
else
would
come
up
because
constitutionally
speaking
in
my
view
at
least
it
makes
no
difference
what
the
prosecutorial
intendment
was
and
i
say,
yes
a
promise
was
not
kept
in
this
case,
but
on
this
record
in
santobello
against
new
york
that
one
may
fairly
conclude
that
that
is
shredding
literally
to
comply
after
all
the
mentioned
it
before
the
sentence,
would
be
an
innocuous
source
of
playing
in
constitutional
charms
and
the
commissary
doctrine
that
we
apply
elsewhere
would
have
a
varied
niche
because
in
short
santobello
got
what
he
bargained
for.
there
are
no
guarantees
in
these
kinds
of
the
situations
that
you
will
stay
out
of
jail.
in
sum
then
i
submit
nothing
in
this
case
violates
the
declarations
of
this
court,
anyone’s
norms
or
ethics
respecting
what
happens
to
santobello
and
at
this
case,
i
tend
to
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
j.
sullivan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
know
of
course
that
this
tribunal
will
look
at
my
briefs
or
statement
of
the
legal
position,
i
have
taken
because
as
yet
i
have
not
heard
it
articulated.
alright,
perhaps
more
importantly,
i
have
not
really
heard
much
that
resembles
the
factually
the
case
of
santobello
against
new
york
and
i
propose
(inaudible)
specific
case.
now,
to
begin
with
counsel
seemed
to
had
some
difficulty
in
focusing
on
just
what
the
legal
question
is
here.
we
are
not
accused
of
trying
to
overreach
as
such
in
this
case,
the
fact
is
this
record
will
demonstrate
that
we
do
not
have
a
prosecutorial
misconduct
case
at
all.
there
is
no
proof
on
this
record
of
any
bad
faith
on
bar.
it
has
been
disclosed
to
the
court
that
when
time
permitted
and
we
became
aware
of
it,
well,
we
disclosed
the
true
fact
here.
now,
the
legal
question
that
i
do
see
here
is
one
of
reviewing
the
exercise
of
judicial
discretion.
in
other
words,
the
judge
at
the
sentencing
level
being
asked
for
permission
to
withdraw
the
plea.
he
acts
decently
in
this
situation
finding
out
now,
where
he
sentenced
the
petitioner
that
perhaps
such
a
promise
has
been
made.
now,
i
will
come
back
hopefully
to
that
in
a
moment.
there
is
more
in
this
record
than
even
the
sentencing
judge
was
aware.
like,
i
am
aware
of
the
powers
of
this
court
to
review
the
record
in
this
in
entirely
and
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
if
you
look
at
this
record,
one
thing
will
become
crystal
clear
that
this
whole
claim
by
the
petitioner
can
be
fairly
rendered
a
sham.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
there
was
never
a
viable
sentence
agreement,
we
can
analogize
the
contract
law.
in
other
words,
santobello
just
never
put
any
stock
in
this
representation.
you
recall
how
it
came
up.
one
assistant
district
attorney
tells
us
before
his
counsel.
the
prosecutor
would
remain
partisan
at
the
time
of
sentence.
petitioner
is
given
a
misdemeanor
plea,
go
ahead
into
the
future,
a
different
assistant
is
in
the
bar
and
he
asked
for
a
maximum
sentence.
in
this
case,
it
was
a
year.
now,
in
support
of
my
claim
and
i
say
the
record
demonstrates,
that
this
i
think
would
fairly
be
called
a
sham
claim.
i
call
the
court’s
attention
in
several
facts.
from
santobello's
perspective,
he
himself
reports
with
his
prior
murder
conviction
and
all
was
no
reign
on
in
the
courts.
he
knew
certainly
that
judges
control
sentences
and
there
was
no
a
judge
privy
to
any
of
the
promises
made
here.
i
have
spoken
already
about
the
limited
scope,
then
the
nature
of
the
promise
itself
i
think
has
a
relevance
here
when
the
man
hopes
that
a
prosecutor
will
remain
partisan
at
the
time
of
sentence.
he
is
not
really
opting
for
much
in
this
situation.
it
is
more,
i
would
suggest
in
expectancy
or
a
hope
really
what
one
might
call
a
promise
and
i
have
referred
in
my
brief
to
several
cases
on
that
score.
mr.
daniel
j.
sullivan
yes
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
is
my
doubt.
i
came
up
on
appeal.
the
claim
was
made
in
the
appellate
division,
so
what
happened
simply
that
call
of
follow
up
that
was
named
or
recorded
asked
him
if
you
made
those
promises,
he
said
yes,
so
it
is
closing.
mr.
daniel
j.
sullivan
pardon
me?
mr.
daniel
j.
sullivan
no.
but
i
am
willing
to
concede
that
the
promise
was
made
before
the
man
pleaded.
i
know
that
to
be
the
fact
that
as
--
say
i
think
in
this
area
i
can
certainly
make
the
confession.
now,
in
short,
the
way
i
got
it
was
that
counsel
said
that
was
you
would
not
ask
or
anything
at
the
time
of
sentencing
and
the
assistant
said
“no,
i
would
not”.
that
is
assistant
a
and
then
of
course
b
comes
in
to
the
picture
at
the
actual
time
of
sentence.
mr.
daniel
j.
sullivan
we
do
not
mr.
justice
stewart,
no.
mr.
daniel
j.
sullivan
well,
then
the
problem
there
was
in
the
review
of
the
record
whether
we
should
make
it
in
session
or
whether
on
balance,
at
least
in
our
view,
we
felt
that
the
man
had
not
been
overreached
and
thus
proceeding,
and
so
that
that
is
on
34
(a)
of
the
appellant's
appendix.
now,
while
characterizing
the
petitioner
here,
i
think
i
may
fairly
say
on
this
record
that
he
was
engaged
in
judge
shopping
here.
you
have
heard
reference
made
to
justice
marks
being
lenient
in
his
sentences
and
that
he
had
but
one
intendment
to
this
petitioner,
that
says
out
of
jail.
alright,
and
i
suggested
to
the
court
that
perhaps
that
is
the
same
kind
of
thread
running
through
this
case
right
up
until
now
despite
the
pro-rata
respecting,
having
to
face
future
charges.
who
knows
what
the
future
will
bring?
but
i
propose
of
what
i
am
saying
here
that
this
was
judge
shopping
in
effort
to
stay
out
of
jail,
you
will
find
that
the
record
indicates
that
santobello’s
first
action
in
this
case
was
to
move
to
suppress
the
tangible
evidence
that
had
been
found
on
its
presence.
now,
it
predates
that
several
months
until
justice
marks,
who
usually
is
in
new
york
county,
up
into
bronx.
as
it
happens
he
takes
the
plea
before
justice
marks.
now,
he
withdraws
that
motion,
alright?
we
never
have
a
point
in
this
case
again
in
which
there
is
any
claim
of
innocence
which
has
a
very
important
bearing
under
the
law
of
new
york
state
because
if
a
man
made
such
a
claim
prior
to
the
actual
pronouncement
of
sentence
or
laws,
is
pretty
much
if
you
have
to
do
something
about
it,
you
have
to
let
him
vacate
or
at
least
to
have
a
hearing.
so
now,
i
said
that
is
an
indication
that
he
picked
this
judge,
and
looked
like
he
was
going
along,
alright.
the
judge
will
order
the
probation
report.
now
wanting
to
adjourn
date
before
justice
marks
with
no
preliminaries,
no
reported
preliminaries.
justice
marks
gets
up
and
says,
in
the
record,
one
line.
in
view
of
the
probation
report
i
am
putting
in
this
case
over.
and
i
say
that
is
an
artilerry
of
things
to
come,
that
a
justice
armed
with
a
full
probation
report,
now
knows
the
background
and
santobello
knows
the
background.
in
short,
there
is
very
little
hope
even
before
justice
marks.
so
what
happens?
a
week
goes
by,
we
have
a
change
and
the
defense
waives,
incomes
santobello
the
petitioner
would
have
battery
emotions
now.
one
of
which
is
to
withdraw
the
plea
of
guilty.
in
it,
among
other
things
he
squares
in
an
affidavit,
hey,
you
did
not
know,
we
had
a
right
to
move
to
suppress.
the
fact
being
he
already
put
in
a
small
affidavit,
abandon
that
claim.
we
submit
to
the
court
as
evidence,
the
conduct
of
this
man
to
be
taken
as
prima-facie
evidence
of
perjury
and
more
important
in
this
context
of
the
fact
that
what
was
happening
here
was
santobello,
the
petitioner
was
trying
to
dupe
the
courts
of
new
york
state,
and
this
case
really
is
the
other
way
around.
mr.
daniel
j.
sullivan
dupe.
in
other
words,
i
am
suggesting
to
this
court
and
on
this
record,
you
may
conclude
that
you
are
going
to
probably
ensure
what
coming
in
here.
looking
for
every
advantage,
not
at
all
concerned
with
the
claim
of
innocence,
that
was
no
where
in
this
case,
i
can
hear
it
now,
first
time.
all
he
wants
to
do
is
walk
away,
avoid
incarceration,
watch
another
mark,
given
his
particular
background.
mr.
daniel
j.
sullivan
oh,
i
think
the
matter,
he
got
out
on
post
conviction,
bail
application
mr.
chief
justice.
now,
again
now
as
i
say,
that
sentencing
over
the
case,
that
particular
affidavit
which
is
fairly
susceptible
of
characterization
as
precarious
and
somehow
disappeared
from
new
york
to
files
in
new
york
supreme
court.
well,
in
any
event
now,
we
react
to
base,
a
suppression
motion
in
conjunction
with
this
effort
to
withdraw
his
plea.
additionally
as
i
say
he
does
not
trigger
the
new
york
law
by
making
a
claim
of
innocence.
at
that
time,
we
offered
him
a
hearing.
as
it
turned
and
particularly
as
we
put
in
our
own
opposing
phase,
it
was
to
challenge
this
assertion
about
how
active
knowledge
of
constitutional
right.
however,
judge
marks
decided
that
we
did
not
need
that
hearing
and
he
puts
the
case
over.
now,
this
truly
came
on
before
justice
gelanoff
and
on
this
record,
i
do
not
know
myself
in
this
record
would
not
tell
you
how
it
got
before
for
him,
characterization
is
that
he
is
a
tough
sentencing
judge.
i
have
made
clear,
i
do
not
see
that
there
is
any
way
that
can
be
determined
on
this
record
but
what
can
be
--
mr.
daniel
j.
sullivan
he
did
mr.
justice
stewart
but
we
come
again
to
this
probation
report
which
is
before
to
the
court
and
i
am
going
to
suggest
shortly,
that
really
there
is
no
alternative.
i
do
not
know
if
santobello
knows.
now,
the
sentencing
proceeding
itself
was
marked
by
the
effort
by
the
attorney
aronstein,
that
to
stole
again,
keep
this
man
out
of
jail.
and
if
you
will
find
it,
it
is
clear
in
the
record,
he
starts
involving
some
things
about
prior
motions
and
about
some
comment
of
one
he
did
not
now,
what
had
happened
when
he
has
been
in
the
part
and
had
been
ruling
--
i
do
not
know,
bogged
down
on
that.
i
think
the
fair
characterization
of
this
episode
is
that
his
last
big
stand
was
to
stay
out
of
jail.
now,
never
was
there
a
formal
motion.
what
happened
was
this,
the
man
will
sentenced
santobello,
counsel
aronstein
and
then
brought
up
the
subject
of
this
prior
promise.
and
that
happened
very
quickly
now.
the
prosecutor
in
the
bar
said
something
about
it
not
being
reflected
in
the
minutes
but
the
prosecution
for
the
defense
for
that
matter
really
did
not
get
an
opportunity
to
dwell
on
this
subject
to
go
into
evidence
because
the
judge
took
over.
so
there
is
no
opportunity
to
do
anymore
even
if
we
want
to
do.
and
what
the
judge
said
in
essence
was
a
promise
or
not,
i
would
not
be
affected
because
i
have
got
an
overriding
probationary
report.
i
would
have
no
alternative
when
he
was
silent,
you
ask
for
the
maximum.
there
is
only
one
thing
i
can
do,
here
is
a
quoted
portion
in
the
record
of
the
probation
report
which
is
a
plea
to
remove
this
man
from
the
streets
and
this
court
now
has
a
full
probation
report
and
of
course,
would
be
better
positioned
to
make
an
analysis
of
the
propriety
of
that
decision
which
as
i
see
it
is
the
question
in
this
case.
usually
this
kind
of
thing
comes
up
in
the
collateral
post-conviction
application.
what
is
happened
here
of
course
is
the
sentencing
judge
was
(inaudible).
now,
there
is
a
tenth
circuit
case
that
(inaudible)
referred
to
in
which
kansas
went
along
much
the
way
i
have
been
speaking
in
tenth
circuit
vacated
judgment.
on
the
reasoning
that
i
have
some
difficulty
coping
with.
however,
kansas
approached
that
this
is
a
matter
of
the
exercise
of
the
judicial
discretion.
the
case
involved
however
a
license
without
over
parole
and
while
we
will
never
know,
the
point
is
that
the
case
was
vacated
and
as
the
reason
is
not
clear.
they
talk
in
terms
of
the
effectiveness
of
the
promise,
i
do
not
see
really
what
difference
that
would
make
because,
had
we
got
ahead
and
remained
partisan,
he
got
no
benefit
from
it.
esthetically,
then
of
course
we
would
have
gotten,
well
he
opted
for
a
bargain
for
and
that
is
what
i
say
essentially
happened
here.
the
judge
is
not
privy
to
it,
he
is
apprised
of
what
happened.
but
the
judge
has
positioned
himself
that
there
is
nothing
else
he
can
do
about
it.
your
honor
i
think
the
biggest
difference
between
this
case
and
white
and
all
is
there
is
no
proof
of
reliance,
whatsoever
in
this
case.
as
i
have
said
before
that
has
been
suggested
here
that
in
reliance
upon
this
assertion,
a
promise
to
remain
partisan
that
santobello
took
the
plea.
you
would
not
find
that
record
at
all
and
if
we
were
even
to
assume,
this
court
will
exercise
its
powers
over
the
facts
that
if
santobello
recalled
that
hearing
and
i
do
not
see
that
it
would
be
necessary
and
we
assume
that
he
testified
it
and
relied
on
it,
well
that
is
a
fact
or
not.
you
have
enough
record
evidence
here.
taking
a
broader
view
of
the
record
to
reject
that
claim
and
in
constitutional
terms,
in
the
narrower
case
if
we
reject
that
argument,
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
he
did
not
in
fact
get
what
i
call
the
functional
equivalency.
certainly,
the
man
has
been
promised
something,
we
have
to
leave
up,
it
would
not
be
here.
mr.
daniel
j.
sullivan
mr.
justice
marshall
yes,
i
say
that
you
will
--
mr.
daniel
j.
sullivan
that
he
might
the
way
--
i
think
he
would
have
gone
--
mr.
daniel
j.
sullivan
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
j.
sullivan
mr.
justice
marshall
i
think
he
could,
they
could
have
stopped.
he
could
have
checked
in.
i
will
read
this
record
and
certainly
there
is
no
indication,
he
knew
what
the
other
fellow
had
done
you
see,
and
as
l
say
that
was
very
quick,
the
whole
thing
you
will
see,
a
line
or
two
in
the
record
and
it
is
over.
mr.
daniel
j.
sullivan
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
do
not
know
why
is
that,
i
think
myself
that.
that
would
have
been
the
case
but
i
am
focusing
on
what
i
believe
to
be
the
legal
question.
mr.
daniel
j.
sullivan
it
is
difficult,
that
is
true
that
this
is
not
the
conventional
type
record
that
comes
up.
what
we
are
trying,
i
submit
respectively
to
assess
is
the
exercise
of
discretion
by
the
sentencing
judge,
that
is
what
is
reviewable
here
and
given
what
i
do
know
if
by
way
of
record
indications
here.
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
exercise
of
that
discretion
cannot
be
forbid
and
in
this
context
that
the
judge
is
going
ahead
in
this
fashion
did
not
deprive
the
petitioner
of
his
constitutional
rights.
mr.
daniel
j.
sullivan
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
feel
it
will
yes.
mr.
daniel
j.
sullivan
no,
mr.
justice.
may
come
to
state
law
and
we
have
cases
on
that,
that
would
have
been
so.
may
i
suggest
mr.
justice
blackmun
that
you
have
virtually
argued
ever
get
in
a
hearing
of
any
kind
presently
in
the
record.
i
think
all
i
can
imagine
i
could
be
at
it
would
be
an
assertion
why
santobello
that
he
relied
upon
this
representation
and
i
just
cannot
imagine
what
else
would
come
up
because
constitutionally
speaking
in
my
view
at
least
it
makes
no
difference
what
the
prosecutorial
intendment
was
and
i
say,
yes
a
promise
was
not
kept
in
this
case,
but
on
this
record
in
santobello
against
new
york
that
one
may
fairly
conclude
that
that
is
shredding
literally
to
comply
after
all
the
mentioned
it
before
the
sentence,
would
be
an
innocuous
source
of
playing
in
constitutional
charms
and
the
commissary
doctrine
that
we
apply
elsewhere
would
have
a
varied
niche
because
in
short
santobello
got
what
he
bargained
for.
there
are
no
guarantees
in
these
kinds
of
the
situations
that
you
will
stay
out
of
jail.
in
sum
then
i
submit
nothing
in
this
case
violates
the
declarations
of
this
court,
anyone’s
norms
or
ethics
respecting
what
happens
to
santobello
and
at
this
case,
i
tend
to
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
