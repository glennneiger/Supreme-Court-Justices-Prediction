we
will
hear
arguments
next
in

santobello
against
new

mr.
anolik
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief

what
is
the
remedy
for
that
then,
would
the
remedy
be
to
send
it
back
or
on
a
re-sentencing
in
circumstances
where
there
was
no
recommendation
or
there
was
a
premise
fulfilled?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
would
not
that
be
a
delivery
of
the
consideration
promised?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
do
not
mean
what
is
the
reason
for
the
notoriety,
what
is
the
reason
that
the
judge
cannot
be
assumed
to
make
a
decision
independently.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
what
he
chose
now
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
is
the
remedy
that
you
would
get.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
all
in
the
appendix?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
begins
at
21
is
it?

warren
e.

mr.
anolik.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
looking
at
page
35
of
the
appendix
where
the
sentencing
judge
said
in
response
to
mr.
aronstein’s
calling
attention
to
an
agreement
which
had
not
been
fulfilled
said
“i
am
not
at
all
inference
by
what
the
district
attorney
says,”
does
not
make
a
particle
of
difference
what
the
district
attorney
says
he
will
do
or
does
not
do.
i
have
here
and
then
he
goes
on
reading
apparently
from
the
pre-sentence
report
indicating
that
this
man
as
he
put
it
was
a
professional
criminal,
a
recidivist
and
that
the
only
way
of
holding
his
criminal
activities
was
to
put
him
away,
that
is
the
language
that
he
used.
now
in
the
face
of
that
categorical
language,
insist
as
i
understand
it
that
the
judge
would
not
have
given
this
same
sentence,
if
the
district
attorney
had
been
absolutely
silent.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
who
is
the
best
judge
of
those
available?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
now
he
did
not
have
much
of
the
range
here
to
work
in,
did
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i
am
speaking
of
the
difference
in
the
range
where
you
have
no
sentence
to
one
year
or
you
had
a
one
year
to
20
years
then
that
is
kind
of
range,
i
am
talking
about.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
addressing
myself
to
the
whole
problem.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
can
understand
he
was
an
advocate,
when
he
compartmentalized
this
--.

mr.
sullivan.
chief

trying
to
do
what?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
much
of
the
sentence
if
any
has
he
served?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
think
--
let
me
ask
you
this
before
you
start
mr.
anolik,
would
you
suggest
that
at
this
case
hypothetically
were
remanded
for
re-sentencing
with
fulfillment
of
the
promise
before
a
different
judge
that,
that
new
judge
could
not
approach
the
matter
with
an
open
mind?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
does
it
make
any
difference
who
he
is?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
your
point?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that
is
something,
that
is
something
we
are
capable
of
evaluating.
the
direct
question
is
that
i
take
it
that
your
position,
no
matter
who
the
judge
is,
he
cannot
fairly
sentence
this
man
just
on
the
basis
of
the
record
without
any
recommendation?
