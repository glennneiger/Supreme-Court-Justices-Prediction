justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
appellee’s
brief
says
that
counts
1,
2,
and
3
were
to
be
reserved
(inaudible)
and
count
4
was
to
be
serve
concurrently
with
count
1?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
i
do
not
quite
understand
that
because
there
is
no
case
in
florida
or
in
georgia
that
says
that
this
statute
is
confined
to
fighting
words?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
even
if
what
was
said
here
where
anyone
would
take
fighting
words,
a
theory
that
the
district
court
went
on
that
it
was
overbroad.
it
might
reach
fighting
words.
it
would
also
reach
(inaudible)
and
it
was
overbroad
and
hence
could
not
be
use
in
this
case
either.
is
that
not
the
theory
of
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
that,
but
even
if
this
statute
were
not
vague
as
what
was
–-
even
if
anyone
would
understand
that
what
was
said
here
was
covered
by
the
statute
and
so
this
person
who
spoke
this
words
had
noticed
that
he
was
violating
this
statute.
the
district
court
said
that
it
was
nevertheless
overbroad.
it
would
cover
a
lot
of
other
things
that
no
one
could
really
tell,
it
was
covered
by
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
that
have
anything
to
do
chaplinsky
or
anything
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
we
are
not.
the
statute
covers
more
than
fighting
words?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
not
what
the
district
court
thought.
this
was
the
district
court
sitting
in
the
state,
judge
smith
did
not
did
not
construe
the
statute
to
be
limited
to
fighting
words.
he
construed
precisely
the
reverse?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
this
was
what
the
judge
means,
judge
smith
or
this
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
is
on
the
panel
on
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
he
specifically
agreed
with
judge
smith?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
made
specifically
rejected
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
as
georgia
judge?
