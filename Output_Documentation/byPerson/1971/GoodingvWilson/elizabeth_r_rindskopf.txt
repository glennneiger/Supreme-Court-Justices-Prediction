ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
open
my
remarks
by
adding
a
footnote
as
to
the
posture
of
this
case.
we
have
already
discussed
the
fact
that
the
appellee
here
has
a
approximately
two
months
left
to
serve
in
his
sentence.
in
addition
to
that
factor
is
a
three-judge
court
which
has
passed
on
the
appropriateness
of
the
statute
as
well.
this
would
bear
on
what
we
were
just
discussing
as
to
how
many
georgia
judges
have
ruled
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
in
fact,
judge
morgan
sat
along
with
circuit
judge
griffin
bell
and
district
judge
alexander
lawrence.
when
the
statute
was
again
attacked
in
a
separate
action
they
accepted
the
opinion
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
agreed
with
it
and
again
held
--
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
i
beg
your
pardon.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
a
very
good
point.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
they
would.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
i
did
not
handle
this
below.
i
believe
the
reason
is
because
he
was
going
through
the
georgia
court.
the
record
reflects
that
he
appealed
that
through
the
court
of
appeals
and
also
applied
for
certiorari
in
this
court
and
i
expect
that
would
probably
take
him
about
a
year’s
time.
i
believe
he
did
properly
his
habeas
in
federal
court.
to
return
to
my
opening
point,
the
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
not
only
do
we
have
a
three-judge
court
ruling,
we
have
the
fifth
circuit
ruling,
we
also
have
a
new
statute
in
this
area,
georgia
code
annotated
26-2610.
the
main
statute
is
really
for
all
intents
and
purposes,
the
same
line
that
we
are
considering
here,
yet
it
continues
to
be
applied.
now,
i
think
that
may
go
to
the
question
of
what
happens
if
this
court
should
overrule
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
what
effect
will
that
decision
have
and
it
would
appear
that
the
georgia
court
seem
to
feel
that
the
new
statute
is
something
different
in
that
a
separate
room
is
going
to
be
required
on
that
statute.
naturally,
we
are
arguing
that
this
court
should
have
affirm
the
fifth
circuit
decision
and
i
think
this
may
support
our
argument
simply
by
the
point
that
any
decision
that
we
get
on
this
particular
case
is
probably
going
to
have
little
effect
both
to
our
appellee
and
to
others
in
like
situation.
there
will
be
no
others
in
like
situation.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
i
am
sorry.
my
remarks
i
think
can
be
brief.
i
think
the
discussion
that
is
already
gone
here
in
the
court
indicates
the
single
fact
here
and
that
no
one
knows
what
an
opprobrious
word
is.
the
georgia
supreme
court
said
that
the
words
used
by
our
appellee
here
were
per
se
opprobrious
whatever
that
may
or
may
not
mean.
i
think
this
is
what
caused
judge
smith
to
overrule
the
statute.
he
felt
that
if
individual
words
can
be
stricken
by
a
statute
that
by
that
act
the
first
amendment
has
been
infringed
upon
--
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
i
am
not
certain
and
i
am
glad
i
do
not
have
to
ask
that
question.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
i
believe
that
is
correct.
i
think
there
were
some
concurrences.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
well,
i
simply
say
that
in
this
situation,
we
have
a
statute
that
goes
much,
much
more
broadly
than
simply
fighting
words.
the
question
as
to
whether
the
words
are
in
this
situations
are
fighting
is
another
question.
i
would
like
to
stress
the
fact
that
we
do
have
here
an
assault
and
battery
committed.
now,
our
appellee
has
already
served
time
for
that
assault
and
battery.
what
we
are
left
with
is
pure
speech
that
--
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
well,
he
has
been
punished
for
his
conduct.
in
effect,
what
happened
was
if
he
had
used
any
other
words,
in
combination
with
the
assault
on
the
person
involved,
he
would
not
have
been
subject
to
this
statute.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
we
are
really
talking
about
--
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
simply
because
i
believe
that
statute
as
drawn
does
not
make
clear
that
it
is
fighting
words
that
are
proscribed.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
no,
i
do
not
agree
that
as
applied
to
him
it
is
constitutional.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
even
if
it
were,
correct.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
i
believe
this
is
what
we
have
applied
in
shuttles
or
what
you
have
--
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
simply
because
i
think
as
interpreted
by
the
georgia
supreme
court
what
they
are
saying
is
that
this
particular
words
fall
within
the
statute.
they
are
per
se
a
violation
of
the
statute
and
i
do
not
believe
that
a
statute
can
say
that
and
that
is
in
effect
the
reading
we
have
on
this
statute.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
i
beg
your
pardon.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
i
am
not
certain
i
understand
the
rest
of
your
question.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
i
think
that
the
answer
to
that
question
and
i
would
say
to
begin
with
but
i
do
not
believe
i
am
competent
to
make
an
answer.
i
think
it
depends
on
who
says
them.
these
are
words
that
have
been
quite
controversial
and
i
think
particularly,
in
the
racial
context,
the
meaning
may
be
different
than
what
ordinarily
we
would
assume
the
words
to
any.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
once
again,
i
will
have
to
--
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
they
were
part
of
an
assault.
correct.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
no.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
it
was
a
concurrent,
in
spontaneous.
in
other
words
--
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
it
was
a
reaction
in
anger.
that
is
correct.
as
the
confrontation
occurred
these
words
were
uttered.
he
lost
his
temper,
i
think
is
what
we
have
to
say.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
that
is
correct.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
the
white
man
was
an
officer.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
that
is
correct.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
the
circumstances
were
a
picket
before
draft
board
and
i
might
add
that
this
occurred
in
1966
prior
to
a
number
of
decisions
for
instance
pond
against
floyd.
it
was
clearly
an
emotionally
charged
situation.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
arising
out
of
the
same
instance.
that
is
correct.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
i
believe
they
are
correct.
now
once
again
i
have
to
ask
your
indulgence.
i
did
not
handle
this
at
the
trial
court
level.
so,
i
am
not
certain
of
that,
but
i
believe
the
facts
stated
are
correct.
i
have
a
few
very
brief
things
to
point
out
about
this
statute
as
well.
one
is
that
the
statute
would
appear
to
have
no
intent
or
willfulness
requirement.
it
is
simply
opprobrious
words
which
tend
to
breach
the
peace.
our
position
would
be
that
without
any
kind
of
willfulness
and
with
the
only
standard
that
of
what
tends
to
cause
a
breach
of
the
peace,
it
is
an
ascertainable
standard
and
one
which
a
person
cannot
be
expected
to
understand
or
comprehend
in
order
to
gauge
his
action
accordingly.
i
think
it
is
also
worthy
of
note,
the
court
has
heard
a
number
of
arguments
today
about
the
victimless
crimes.
i
think
we
have
such
a
situation
here.
the
appellee
has
already
been
punished
for
his
assault.
what
is
left
are
few
profanities
that
he
uttered
in
anger
and
i
wonder
that
a
statute
can
in
this
day
and
age
be
held
by
the
highest
court
in
the
state
to
per
se
outlaw
words
that
he
uttered
in
such
a
situation.
we
would
feel
in
conclusion
that
this
court’s
opinion
in
cohen
against
california
bears
very
heavily
on
the
situation
presented
here.
my
reading
of
that
opinion
would
be
that
it
is
improper
for
a
state
court
to
outlaw
individual
words
and
that
is
precisely
--
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
i
beg
your
pardon.
i
hope
i
have.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
i
am
assuming
that
chaplinsky
is
a
good
law.
i
have
not
assumed
that
that
has
been
overruled.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
well,
but
what
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
said
was
that
by
the
utterance
of
these
words,
he
offended
the
statute.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
that
is
not
what
the
court
said.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
no,
but
as
i
read
that
opinion,
it
refers
to
at
any
time
these
words
are
said
within
the
hearing
of
others,
that
is
per
se
a
violation
of
the
statute.
the
words
used
by
the
court
were
in
and
off
themselves
are
opprobrious.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
yes,
we
do.
in
conclusion,
i
would
simply
stress
the
fact
that
to
reverse
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
decision
is
in
all
probability
going
to
affect
no
one.
we
feel
that
a
statute
as
presently
drawn
is
overbroad
that
it
presents
a
standard
that
our
appellee
could
not
have
hope
to
understood
or
to
have
foreseen
at
the
time
he
began
his
picketing
in
this
situation
and
that
consequently,
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
opinion
should
be
upheld
in
this
instance.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
i
beg
your
pardon.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
he
did
know
about
it?
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
what
i
am
saying
mr.
justice
marshall
is
that
if
he
knew
of
the
statute
he
certainly
could
not
know
what
would
be
offensive
to
it
because
of
the
interpretations
of
the
georgia
supreme
court.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
well,
he
has
been
punished
for
that.
we
do
not
question
the
situation
under
the
assault
and
battery.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
they
were
–-
they
occurred
concurrently.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
question.
i
have
great
questions
as
to
whether
he
can
be
punished
twice
for
what
was
in
effect
one
offense,
but
that
is
presently
the
law
in
georgia
and
we
do
not
raise
that
here.
it
seems
to
me
that
what
they
are
saying
is
that
the
fact
of
his
utterance
of
these
words
by
that
fact
then
also
rendered
him
subject
to
the
statute
that
we
attack
here,
the
opprobrious
words
statute.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
there
is
a
new
statute
and
cite
to
that
is
26
georgia
code
annotated
2610.
now
the
point
i
make
is
that
that
statute
reads
almost
identically
to
the
one
that
we
consider
here.
i
think
what
is
relevant
about
the
presence
of
that
new
statute
is
that
the
georgia
courts
have
continued
to
apply
the
new
statute.
it
would
--
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
no,
it
was
enacted
in
1968
effective
july
1,
1969.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
i
believe
there
is,
yes.
it
appears
i
believe
in
the
statement
of
facts
and
i
think
the
three-judge
court
opinion
is
also
cited
there.
i
point
that
out
simply
to
stress
the
fact
that
i
believe
at
any
decision
overruling
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
is
going
to
be
of
little
effect
because
i
believe
that
the
position
will
be
in
the
georgia
court
that
they
have
a
new
statute.
apparently,
that
is
how
they
are
operating
now.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
that
is
correct.
basically,
what
happened
there
was
that
they
reordered
the
opprobrious
words
statute.
they
put
some
sub-headings
in
it,
excuse
me,
and
added
a
provision
regarding
use
of
the
telephone.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
yes.
(voice
overlap)
yes,
it
is
but
as
i
say,
i
do
not
know
whether
--
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
as
if
it
is
new.
that
is
correct.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
thank
you.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
your
honor,
just
to
clarify
one
point.
the
reason
why
we
are
continuing
to
utilize
convictions
under
the
statute
is
because
in
light
of
the
nature
of
this
case
and
the
way
it
which
it
came
to
this
court,
we
do
not
feel
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
precludes
prosecutions
under
the
statute
that
this
court
has
spoken
one
way
or
the
other.
i
may
be
wrong
but
people
called
me
and
asking
about
it
and
i
have
given
my
opinion
to
that
effect.
this
was
not
an
injunctive
type
of
procedure.
it
was
directed
only
to
this
particular
habeas
corpus
applicant
and
it
is
only
a
law
of
that
case
until
we
have
a
broad
overview.
the
new
statute
we
will
find
in
the
white
pamphlet.
this
is
a
result
of
the
recodification
of
the
georgia
law
and
it
bears
the
same
numbers
as
the
old
area,
but
the
new
26-2610
which
mr.
rindskopf
referred
will
be
found
in
the
white
pamphlet.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
open
my
remarks
by
adding
a
footnote
as
to
the
posture
of
this
case.
we
have
already
discussed
the
fact
that
the
appellee
here
has
a
approximately
two
months
left
to
serve
in
his
sentence.
in
addition
to
that
factor
is
a
three-judge
court
which
has
passed
on
the
appropriateness
of
the
statute
as
well.
this
would
bear
on
what
we
were
just
discussing
as
to
how
many
georgia
judges
have
ruled
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
in
fact,
judge
morgan
sat
along
with
circuit
judge
griffin
bell
and
district
judge
alexander
lawrence.
when
the
statute
was
again
attacked
in
a
separate
action
they
accepted
the
opinion
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
agreed
with
it
and
again
held
--
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
i
beg
your
pardon.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
a
very
good
point.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
they
would.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
i
did
not
handle
this
below.
i
believe
the
reason
is
because
he
was
going
through
the
georgia
court.
the
record
reflects
that
he
appealed
that
through
the
court
of
appeals
and
also
applied
for
certiorari
in
this
court
and
i
expect
that
would
probably
take
him
about
a
year’s
time.
i
believe
he
did
properly
his
habeas
in
federal
court.
to
return
to
my
opening
point,
the
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
not
only
do
we
have
a
three-judge
court
ruling,
we
have
the
fifth
circuit
ruling,
we
also
have
a
new
statute
in
this
area,
georgia
code
annotated
26-2610.
the
main
statute
is
really
for
all
intents
and
purposes,
the
same
line
that
we
are
considering
here,
yet
it
continues
to
be
applied.
now,
i
think
that
may
go
to
the
question
of
what
happens
if
this
court
should
overrule
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
what
effect
will
that
decision
have
and
it
would
appear
that
the
georgia
court
seem
to
feel
that
the
new
statute
is
something
different
in
that
a
separate
room
is
going
to
be
required
on
that
statute.
naturally,
we
are
arguing
that
this
court
should
have
affirm
the
fifth
circuit
decision
and
i
think
this
may
support
our
argument
simply
by
the
point
that
any
decision
that
we
get
on
this
particular
case
is
probably
going
to
have
little
effect
both
to
our
appellee
and
to
others
in
like
situation.
there
will
be
no
others
in
like
situation.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
i
am
sorry.
my
remarks
i
think
can
be
brief.
i
think
the
discussion
that
is
already
gone
here
in
the
court
indicates
the
single
fact
here
and
that
no
one
knows
what
an
opprobrious
word
is.
the
georgia
supreme
court
said
that
the
words
used
by
our
appellee
here
were
per
se
opprobrious
whatever
that
may
or
may
not
mean.
i
think
this
is
what
caused
judge
smith
to
overrule
the
statute.
he
felt
that
if
individual
words
can
be
stricken
by
a
statute
that
by
that
act
the
first
amendment
has
been
infringed
upon
--
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
i
am
not
certain
and
i
am
glad
i
do
not
have
to
ask
that
question.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
i
believe
that
is
correct.
i
think
there
were
some
concurrences.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
well,
i
simply
say
that
in
this
situation,
we
have
a
statute
that
goes
much,
much
more
broadly
than
simply
fighting
words.
the
question
as
to
whether
the
words
are
in
this
situations
are
fighting
is
another
question.
i
would
like
to
stress
the
fact
that
we
do
have
here
an
assault
and
battery
committed.
now,
our
appellee
has
already
served
time
for
that
assault
and
battery.
what
we
are
left
with
is
pure
speech
that
--
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
well,
he
has
been
punished
for
his
conduct.
in
effect,
what
happened
was
if
he
had
used
any
other
words,
in
combination
with
the
assault
on
the
person
involved,
he
would
not
have
been
subject
to
this
statute.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
we
are
really
talking
about
--
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
simply
because
i
believe
that
statute
as
drawn
does
not
make
clear
that
it
is
fighting
words
that
are
proscribed.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
no,
i
do
not
agree
that
as
applied
to
him
it
is
constitutional.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
even
if
it
were,
correct.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
i
believe
this
is
what
we
have
applied
in
shuttles
or
what
you
have
--
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
simply
because
i
think
as
interpreted
by
the
georgia
supreme
court
what
they
are
saying
is
that
this
particular
words
fall
within
the
statute.
they
are
per
se
a
violation
of
the
statute
and
i
do
not
believe
that
a
statute
can
say
that
and
that
is
in
effect
the
reading
we
have
on
this
statute.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
i
beg
your
pardon.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
i
am
not
certain
i
understand
the
rest
of
your
question.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
i
think
that
the
answer
to
that
question
and
i
would
say
to
begin
with
but
i
do
not
believe
i
am
competent
to
make
an
answer.
i
think
it
depends
on
who
says
them.
these
are
words
that
have
been
quite
controversial
and
i
think
particularly,
in
the
racial
context,
the
meaning
may
be
different
than
what
ordinarily
we
would
assume
the
words
to
any.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
once
again,
i
will
have
to
--
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
they
were
part
of
an
assault.
correct.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
no.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
it
was
a
concurrent,
in
spontaneous.
in
other
words
--
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
it
was
a
reaction
in
anger.
that
is
correct.
as
the
confrontation
occurred
these
words
were
uttered.
he
lost
his
temper,
i
think
is
what
we
have
to
say.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
that
is
correct.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
the
white
man
was
an
officer.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
that
is
correct.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
the
circumstances
were
a
picket
before
draft
board
and
i
might
add
that
this
occurred
in
1966
prior
to
a
number
of
decisions
for
instance
pond
against
floyd.
it
was
clearly
an
emotionally
charged
situation.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
arising
out
of
the
same
instance.
that
is
correct.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
i
believe
they
are
correct.
now
once
again
i
have
to
ask
your
indulgence.
i
did
not
handle
this
at
the
trial
court
level.
so,
i
am
not
certain
of
that,
but
i
believe
the
facts
stated
are
correct.
i
have
a
few
very
brief
things
to
point
out
about
this
statute
as
well.
one
is
that
the
statute
would
appear
to
have
no
intent
or
willfulness
requirement.
it
is
simply
opprobrious
words
which
tend
to
breach
the
peace.
our
position
would
be
that
without
any
kind
of
willfulness
and
with
the
only
standard
that
of
what
tends
to
cause
a
breach
of
the
peace,
it
is
an
ascertainable
standard
and
one
which
a
person
cannot
be
expected
to
understand
or
comprehend
in
order
to
gauge
his
action
accordingly.
i
think
it
is
also
worthy
of
note,
the
court
has
heard
a
number
of
arguments
today
about
the
victimless
crimes.
i
think
we
have
such
a
situation
here.
the
appellee
has
already
been
punished
for
his
assault.
what
is
left
are
few
profanities
that
he
uttered
in
anger
and
i
wonder
that
a
statute
can
in
this
day
and
age
be
held
by
the
highest
court
in
the
state
to
per
se
outlaw
words
that
he
uttered
in
such
a
situation.
we
would
feel
in
conclusion
that
this
court’s
opinion
in
cohen
against
california
bears
very
heavily
on
the
situation
presented
here.
my
reading
of
that
opinion
would
be
that
it
is
improper
for
a
state
court
to
outlaw
individual
words
and
that
is
precisely
--
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
i
beg
your
pardon.
i
hope
i
have.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
i
am
assuming
that
chaplinsky
is
a
good
law.
i
have
not
assumed
that
that
has
been
overruled.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
well,
but
what
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
said
was
that
by
the
utterance
of
these
words,
he
offended
the
statute.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
that
is
not
what
the
court
said.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
no,
but
as
i
read
that
opinion,
it
refers
to
at
any
time
these
words
are
said
within
the
hearing
of
others,
that
is
per
se
a
violation
of
the
statute.
the
words
used
by
the
court
were
in
and
off
themselves
are
opprobrious.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
yes,
we
do.
in
conclusion,
i
would
simply
stress
the
fact
that
to
reverse
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
decision
is
in
all
probability
going
to
affect
no
one.
we
feel
that
a
statute
as
presently
drawn
is
overbroad
that
it
presents
a
standard
that
our
appellee
could
not
have
hope
to
understood
or
to
have
foreseen
at
the
time
he
began
his
picketing
in
this
situation
and
that
consequently,
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
opinion
should
be
upheld
in
this
instance.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
i
beg
your
pardon.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
he
did
know
about
it?
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
what
i
am
saying
mr.
justice
marshall
is
that
if
he
knew
of
the
statute
he
certainly
could
not
know
what
would
be
offensive
to
it
because
of
the
interpretations
of
the
georgia
supreme
court.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
well,
he
has
been
punished
for
that.
we
do
not
question
the
situation
under
the
assault
and
battery.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
they
were
–-
they
occurred
concurrently.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
question.
i
have
great
questions
as
to
whether
he
can
be
punished
twice
for
what
was
in
effect
one
offense,
but
that
is
presently
the
law
in
georgia
and
we
do
not
raise
that
here.
it
seems
to
me
that
what
they
are
saying
is
that
the
fact
of
his
utterance
of
these
words
by
that
fact
then
also
rendered
him
subject
to
the
statute
that
we
attack
here,
the
opprobrious
words
statute.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
there
is
a
new
statute
and
cite
to
that
is
26
georgia
code
annotated
2610.
now
the
point
i
make
is
that
that
statute
reads
almost
identically
to
the
one
that
we
consider
here.
i
think
what
is
relevant
about
the
presence
of
that
new
statute
is
that
the
georgia
courts
have
continued
to
apply
the
new
statute.
it
would
--
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
no,
it
was
enacted
in
1968
effective
july
1,
1969.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
i
believe
there
is,
yes.
it
appears
i
believe
in
the
statement
of
facts
and
i
think
the
three-judge
court
opinion
is
also
cited
there.
i
point
that
out
simply
to
stress
the
fact
that
i
believe
at
any
decision
overruling
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
is
going
to
be
of
little
effect
because
i
believe
that
the
position
will
be
in
the
georgia
court
that
they
have
a
new
statute.
apparently,
that
is
how
they
are
operating
now.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
that
is
correct.
basically,
what
happened
there
was
that
they
reordered
the
opprobrious
words
statute.
they
put
some
sub-headings
in
it,
excuse
me,
and
added
a
provision
regarding
use
of
the
telephone.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
yes.
(voice
overlap)
yes,
it
is
but
as
i
say,
i
do
not
know
whether
--
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
as
if
it
is
new.
that
is
correct.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
thank
you.
ms.
elizabeth
r.
rindskopf
your
honor,
just
to
clarify
one
point.
the
reason
why
we
are
continuing
to
utilize
convictions
under
the
statute
is
because
in
light
of
the
nature
of
this
case
and
the
way
it
which
it
came
to
this
court,
we
do
not
feel
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
precludes
prosecutions
under
the
statute
that
this
court
has
spoken
one
way
or
the
other.
i
may
be
wrong
but
people
called
me
and
asking
about
it
and
i
have
given
my
opinion
to
that
effect.
this
was
not
an
injunctive
type
of
procedure.
it
was
directed
only
to
this
particular
habeas
corpus
applicant
and
it
is
only
a
law
of
that
case
until
we
have
a
broad
overview.
the
new
statute
we
will
find
in
the
white
pamphlet.
this
is
a
result
of
the
recodification
of
the
georgia
law
and
it
bears
the
same
numbers
as
the
old
area,
but
the
new
26-2610
which
mr.
rindskopf
referred
will
be
found
in
the
white
pamphlet.
