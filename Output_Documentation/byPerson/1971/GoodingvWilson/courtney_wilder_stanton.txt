mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
is
before
this
court
on
an
appeal
from
the
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
declaring
to
be
unconstitutional
upon
its
face,
a
georgia
statute
prescribing
the
unprovoked
use
to
or
of
another
and
in
his
presence
opprobrious
words
or
abuse
language,
tending
to
a
breach
of
the
peace.
unless
the
court
has
some
other
direction
it
would
like
to
give
me,
i
would
like
to
cover
basically
what
i
consider
to
be
the
points
of
drawing
issue
of
the
briefs
submitted
by
the
two
sides.
first
of
all,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
case
is
controlled
adversely
to
acquisition
by
the
decision
of
this
court
in
edwards
against
south
carolina.
i
would
seek
permission
from
the
court
to
add
one
additional
citation
to
what
i
consider
to
be
controlling
state
authority
only
on
substation
of
an
element
of
this
particular
offense
which
i
inadvertently
omitted
from
my
brief.
that
case
is
the
decision
of
garvin
against
the
mayor.

is
where
the
decision
is
covered.
mr.

stanton
m-a-y-o-r.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
it
is
the
title
of
the
officer,
your
honor.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
it
is
controlling
unless
it
is
reverse
by
a
decision
of
supreme
court
of
georgia
which
would
mean
in
conflict
with
it,
in
other
words,
it
would
have
the
same
effect
on
the
trial
courts,
a
decision
of
a
court
of
appeals
sitting
in
that
circuit
upon
the
district
within
the
circuit.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
well,
we
only
have
one
court
of
appeal,
your
honor.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
that
sits
in
atlanta
and
it
has
statewide
jurisdiction.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
well,
i
am
not
really
all
that
familiar
with
the
facts
in
this
case
because
of
the
facial
question
that
was
presented.
we
did
not
go
into
a
great
detail
on
the
record
in
the
case.
i
feel
that
we
can
take
the
issues
that
were
raised
before
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
as
being
issues
that
were
raised
before
the
supreme
court.
in
other
words,
these
were
the
enumerations
of
the
questions
that
were
laid
before
the
state
court
for
determination.
the
district
court
found
for
instance
that
there
had
not
been
exhaustion
as
to
the
bulk
of
the
material
that
was
encompassed
within
the
application
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
refuse
to
consider
the
bulk
of
the
contentions
that
were
brought
forth
by
the
applicant,
the
appellee
here
at
that
point.
it
turned
only
on
the
facial
constitutionality
and
proceeded
from
there.
the
holding
in
the
case
that
i
have
just
called
the
courtâ€™s
attention
here
deals
with
the
question
of
the
broadness
of
the
concept
to
breach
of
the
peace
and
i
think
it
is
very
important
because
i
think,
georgia
at
this
point
departs
from
its
neighboring
state
of
south
carolina
to
a
very
significant
extent.
the
court
held
that
one
who
commits
a
breach
of
the
peace
is
of
course
guilty
of
disorderly
conduct,
but
they
went
on
to
say,
but
not
all
disorderly
conduct
is
necessarily
a
breach
of
the
peace.
that
is
where
its
merely
calculated
to
disturb
are
annoyed
and
i
would
submit
that
this
is
a
pretty
sound
analysis,
long
before
we
ever
gotten
to
this
area
of
severe
constitutional
questions
of
what
concerns
the
breaking
of
the
peace.
now
we
tend,
i
think
in
our
decisions
to
take
disruptions
of
the
peace
and
actual
breaches
of
the
peace
and
mix
them
all
together
and
of
course
that
is
the
bias
i
find
in
many
of
the
ordinances
and
statutes
and
common-law
offenses
as
we
find
in
state
courts
that
this
court
has
had
to
deal
with.
in
edwards
against
south
carolina,
we
have
a
case
where
the
offense
was
tainted
in
my
mind
by
the
circumstances
of
the
state
approved
application.
and
the
court
there
noted
the
state
could
not
make
criminal,
a
peaceful
expression
of
unpopular
views
and
that
was
the
width
to
which
the
breach
of
peace
definition
of
the
common-law
crime
adopted
by
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
took
the
situation.
the
court
went
on
to
note
and
i
think
rather
significantly
that
the
record
which
it
looked
at
in
the
south
carolina
case
was
barren
of
fighting
words
as
that
term
is
used
and
south
carolina
had
extended
the
concept
of
the
breach
of
peace
to
encompass
all
forms
of
disorderly
conduct,
including
conduct
which
was
merely
calculated
to
disturb
or
annoy
and
therein
was
a
vice
of
this
particular
common-law
offense.
i
think
we
really
get
into
a
very
similar
situation
in
cox
and
in
terminiello
against
chicago
where
we
have
an
application
by
state
courts
approved,
and
therefore,
becoming
an
authoritative
interpretation
of
the
ordinance
or
statute
involved
which
reaches
out
beyond
the
idea
of
breaching
the
peace
and
goes
to
the
disruption
of
the
peace
in
disturbing
or
annoying
antics,
conditions
of
words.
and
the
court
has
held
that
that
cannot
necessarily
be
consistent
with
the
first
amendment
made
unlawful.
the
decision
of
the
court
below
in
affecting
corporates
on
this
issue,
the
decision
of
the
district
court
and
i
was
really
somewhat
surprised
about
this
because
of
the
first
portion
of
the
opinion,
the
court
of
appeals
was
not
even
arguing
it.
the
first
question
was
just
submitted.
we
spent
the
entire
time
arguing
this
question.
they
ruled
on
the
first
issue
on
the
theory
that
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
should
have
the
benefit
of
the
court
of
appeals
determination
and
then
on
the
one
issue
that
was
really
controlling
the
case
did
not
give
us
any
real
benefit
of
their
determination.
they
--
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
yes
sir.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
yes
sir,
concurrent
with
count
3.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
that
is
also
under
the
statute.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
about
a
month
and
a
half.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
no
sir,
his
first
two
sentences
have
been
served
most
for
the
assault
and
battery
sentences.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
service
of
both
was
completed
before
the
application
for
which
it
was
filed
in
the
district
court
and
then
it
was
filed
on
the
basis
of
the
final
two
concurrent
sentences
which
(voice
overlap)
but
consecutive
with
the
first
two.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
that
would
be
correct.
count
3
would
be
consecutive
to
count
2.
that
is
one
of
the
counts
that
deals
with
this
particular
statute.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
three
not
one.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
yes
sir.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
good
time
took
care
of
the
difference.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
i
think
it
is
about
a
month-and-a-half.
i
have
not
computed
it
out,
but
he
has
time
left
on
the
sentence
at
the
time
of
writ
was
granted
and
he
was
committed
to
bail.
the
court
below,
the
district
court
seem
to
feel
there
was
regular
confusion
in
the
georgia
cases
in
this
area.
those
cases
are
authoritatively
construed
under
the
provision
under
attack.
i
think
there
was
a
rather
obvious
mistake
in
relying
upon
what
was
really
bare
bunk
style
of
disposals
of
questions
and
procedures
and
evidentiary
sufficiency
in
certain
cases.
this
resulted
in
fact
with
prior
to
1902
and
most
of
the
authority
in
this
case
came
out,
we
had
a
one
tier
appellate
court
system
in
georgia.
of
course,
there
was
a
tendency
to
take
a
decision
and
decided
on
exactly
what
was
brought
to
the
court
and
just
really
in
what
was
in
effect
an
order
on
the
case.
many
of
the
decisions
dealt
with
questions
of
provocation
and
for
reason
or
other
there
was
a
period
of
time
when
apparently
the
trial
courts,
when
instructing
the
jury
that
this
was
or
was
not
provocation.
well
of
course
provocation
is
not
a
defense
under
this
defense
and
lack
of
it.
it
is
an
element
which
a
state
must
prove
and
therefore
of
course
it
was
wrong
to
withdraw
this
question
from
the
jury
and
in
fact
shift
the
burden
to
the
defendant
of
coming
in
and
showing
that
a
certain
set
of
facts
was
provocation.
he
had
no
such
burden
in
any
evidence
he
brought
into
that
case
would
simply
go
against
the
state
to
prove
up
law
the
provocation
which
is
an
element
it
must
prove
under
this
offense.
so
i
think
when
we
view
the
offense
in
that
area,
actually
review
the
decision
as
opposed
to
the
language,
only
hang
up
on
the
language
of
some
disordered
propositions,
we
see
that
they
are
all
quite
consistent.
in
fisk
against
state
which
is
one
of
the
cases
that
they
indicate
they
feel
there
is
a
conflict
between
the
wilson
decision
some
63
years
later,
we
have
the
language
used
and
charges
soar
to
a
line
and
the
trial
judge
instructed
the
jury
that
this
was
opprobrious
words
and
abuse
of
language
and
the
court
said
no
you
cannot
do
that.
you
cannot
instruct
the
jury
as
to
an
element
of
the
offense
which
i
think
seems
pretty
obvious
that
you
cannot
tell
the
jury
that
this
person
has
violated
the
statute,
not
least
under
our
georgia
law
where
you
cannot
even
make
a
trial
judge
a
comment
on
it,
much
less
withdraw
in
a
criminal
case
have
fortunately
charge
or
the
offense
from
consideration
of
the
jury.
now
if
we
must
view
it
against
some
backdrop
of
what
is
really
involved
in
the
case,
the
decision
is
quite
clear
and
i
think
that
the
real
difference
in
the
quality
of
the
language
that
we
used
in
the
wilson
case
and
that
which
was
used
in
the
fisk
case.
there
are
certain
words
quite
obviously
are
going
to
be
opprobrious
or
abusive
if
used
to
another
person
as
what
the
supreme
court
said
without
a
smile
upon
your
face
so
to
speak
(inaudible).
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
i
think
it
is
the
use
of
the
abusive
language
to
the
other
person.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
i
think
it
will
be
a
violation
standard
by
itself,
your
honor.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
even
without
the
other
words
in
it.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
that
is
of
course
the
question
of
common
knowledge
and
understanding
of
what
is
it
when
it
is
used
under
those
circumstances.
i
would
think
it
would
intend
the
breach
of
the
peace
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
i
would
think
it
would
not.
i
mean,
as
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
and
understanding
of
hypothetical
reasonable
men
always
put
myself
in
just
being
hypothetical
reasonable
man,
but
it
may
not
be.
in
my
call,
maybe
that
son
of
a
gun
would
not
be
perhaps
or
words
that
would
tend
under
ordinary
circumstances
naturally.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
it
carries
out
a
much
heavier
connotation
i
think
or
higher
degree
of
opprobrium.
one
may
simply
be
offensive
or
not
desirable.
it
is
something
you
would
rather
not
have
said
to
you.
the
other
one
of
course
carries
with
it
a
degree
of
infamy
opprobriousness
or
whatever
fails.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
i
would
certainly
think
that.
a
crime
of
treason
is
an
infamies
crime
and
of
course
the
clearest
thing
i
could
say
if
i
have
to
come
in
and
try
to
equate
synonyms
and
i
do
not
think
you
can
ever
take
one
word
in
english
language
and
say
there
is
an
equal
for
it.
i
mean,
if
we
did
we
would
not
need
all
the
words
that
we
have,
but
a
program
probably
comes
closet
to
me
in
scarless.
it
probably
comes
closet
to
be
infamies
and
of
course
treason
is
an
infamies
crime,
at
least
in
my
mind
it
is,
and
i
think
the
common
knowledge
and
understanding
of
people,
treason
would
be
an
infamies
crime.
so
in
effect
what
you
are
saying
to
a
person
you
accuse
of
benedict
arnold
is
you
are
a
traitor
and
if
that
was
used
under
such
circumstances
to
a
person
that
the
backdrop
of
the
circumstances
were
such
that
is
ordinary
conditions
it
would
lead
to
a
breach
of
the
peace,
a
resentment
by
physical
violence
of
the
person
to
whom
is
directed
and
i
think
he
would
definitely
--
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
we
feel
that
this
statute
has
always
been
applied
to
exactly
that
kind
of
language.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
the
fighting
words
idea
and
if
you
review
all
the
decisions,
for
instance
you
swore
to
a
liable,
of
course,
this
came
out
of
backdrop
of
a
criminal
or
civil
procedure,
anyway
it
was
a
witness
to
him
this
was
directed.
this
of
course
is
charging
at
least
what
at
that
time
was
infamy
to
perjure
oneself
and
swear
to
a
lot.
i
would
think
that
would
be
an
opprobrious
word.
and
i
think
if
it
were
used
to
a
person
under
the
right
circumstances,
of
course,
it
would
likely
invoke
the
person
to
resent
by
--
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
no,
i
do
not
think
the
real
case
on
this
of
course,
the
georgia
court
of
appeals
case
in
elmore
which
was
in
1915
and
is
set
forth
in
our
brief.
this
is
really
one
of
the
few
cases
that
really
discusses
this
thing
at
the
kind
of
length
normally
an
appellate
court
discusses
it.
dillard
which
the
court
rejected
before
it
does
too.
i
think
it
is
perfectly
applicable.
there
are
really
only
two
what
you
might
call
extensive
discussions
of
the
principles
in
this
case.
in
an
elmore
they
really
emphasize
what
they
term
and
i
think
may
be
a
real
good
terminology
for
this
thing
the
court
talks
about
i
think
violent
reaction,
but
in
the
case
out
in
california,
in
cohen
versus
california
about
words
lack
and
reduce
a
violent
reaction.
they
are
talking
about
physical
resentment
and
i
think
in
context
of
the
statute
that
is
probably
the
best
terminology,
you
could
use
to
describe
what
you
are
talking
about.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
yes
sir.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
15
and
the
decision
is
--
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
it
is
the
elmore
case.
it
is
set
forth
in
our
brief
your
honor.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
they
talk
about
the
language
addressed
to
a
prisoner,
in
other
words,
here
is
a
person
in
a
cell.
now
obviously,
this
person
which
going
back
to
a
reasonable
ordinary
circumstance,
this
person
does
not
physically
at
that
moment
have
the
capability
to
resent
this
by
physical
violence,
but
he
is
protected
from
this
kind
of
language.
he
is
protected
by
the
bail
of
his
offense
and
then
subjected
to
abuse
of
opprobrious
language
under
these
circumstances
and
he
has
not
rendered
outside
the
pail
of
his
protection
simply
because
of
that
moment,
he
cannot
as
they
use
the
term
physically
resent.
well,
this
says
two
things.
one
it
says
a
necessity.
you
look
towards
physical
resentment.
the
potential
or
likely
good
are
they
as
determining
whether
or
not
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
statute.
obviously,
the
man
could
--
you
by
yelling
back
at
you.
people
in
--
he
could
do
many
things
that
might
be
disturbing,
but
he
cannot
do
one
thing
and
that
is
get
at
you,
but
he
is
still
protected
by
it.
and
they
went
all
to
talk
about
the
personally
opposite
bank
of
an
impassible
torrent.
they
talked
about
one
who
is
without
power
to
respond
immediately
to
such
vernal
insults
by
physical
retaliation
and
then
they
liken
it
perhaps
dramatically
to
a
paralytic
who
is
utterly
unable
to
break
the
peace
by
any
act
if
physical
violence
which
says
two
things.
one
that
they
are
looking
towards
the
physical
violence
idea
of
breaching
the
peace
and
secondly
that
you
are
looking
toward
an
ordinary
circumstance
situation
that
you
do
not
take
in
color
the
offense
by
the
nature
of
the
person
against
whom
this
particular
offense
is
rendered.
in
other
words,
it
is
not
a
question
of
person
being
highly
susceptible
to
this
or
another
person
not
being
susceptible
or
a
person
being
physically
overpowering
and
that
is
bully
your
pipes,
i
mean,
you
just
do
not
go
on
that
basis.
it
is
an
ordinary
circumstances
viewed
from
the
reasonable
man
hypothesis
and
therefore
a
paralytic
who
could
not
under
any
circumstances
resent
this
by
physical
violence
is
still
protected
by
this
particular
statute.
this
is
not
a
victimless
crime,
more
order
type
statute
is
protecting
a
particular
individual
that
is
a
person
who
is
a
victim
of
the
offense
to
whom
this
language
is
addressed
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
from
one
in
effect,
i
would
describe
as
a
verbal
assault.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
but
and
of
course
that
is
incorporated
by
statute
whereas
even
in
the
battery
situation
in
georgia,
the
words
could
come
in
for
the
purpose
of
perhaps
a
little
different
in
light
of
connotation
for
the
purpose
of
perhaps
being
a
justification
if
the
other
person
does
resent
by
physical
violence
as
to
rather
unusual
court
in
georgia
law,
but
is
in
there
nevertheless.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
no,
i
do
not
see
any
way
we
could.
if
we
describe
and
made
unlawful
binding
words,
somebody
be
up
here
continuing
if
that
was
not
applicable
to
bind.
there
may
be
200
ways
you
could
sit
down
and
describe
fighting
words.
the
court
i
think
in
one
of
the
last
cases
said
that
they
were
personally
abusive
epitaphs
which
one
addressed
to
the
ordinary
citizen
or
as
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
inherently
likely
to
provoke
violent
reaction.
the
georgia
legislature
back
during
the
reconstruction
really
contemporaneously
with
the
enactment
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
by
which
this
particular
statute
is
now
tried
to
find
in
terms
of
abusive
language
opprobrious
words
and
went
on
to
couple
together
the
elements.
there
is
no
history
that
would
indicate
that
this
has
ever
been
applied
to
anything
except
to
what
would
appear
from
common
knowledge
and
understanding
to
be
fighting
words.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
yes
sir.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
no
sir,
i
do
not
think
we
have
to
overrule
chaplinsky
because
chaplinsky
in
effect
said
that
fighting
words
--
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
oh
i
am
sorry
your
honor.
yes
i
am
so
used
to
sitting
from
the
other
side,
i
would
like
to
have
a
reverse
on
order,
affirmed.
now,
i
think
you
would
have
to
overrule
chaplinsky
or
at
least
make
such
an
extensive
exception
to
it
but
it
would
have
no
more
validity.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
there
has
never
been
that
determination
as
such
in
that
language,
your
honor.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
of
course,
it
went
on
the
district
court.
it
went
on
the
theory
and
it
talks
about
the
fact
that
that
this
could
be
equated
with
offensive
words
or
of
course
obviously
opprobrious
words,
abuse
of
language
would
be
offensive,
but
not
all
offensive
words
would
be
opprobrious
or
abusive.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
this
case
was
twisted
and
turned
--
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
but
i
have
a
little
difficulty
your
honor,
seeing
how
it
would
cover
in
conduct
that
would
be
otherwise
protected.
we
talk
about
fighting
words
and
--
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
not,
as
i
say,
i
feel
it
is
synonymous
with
fighting
words.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
look
at
the
way
in
which
judge
smith
went
about
it
though.
we
took
the
synonyms
that
were
out
of
the
dictionary
and
he
took
this
great
words
(voice
overlap)
at
least
it
has
--
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
well,
i
would
suggest
very
strongly
that
judge
smith
was
not
on
target
in
construing
the
georgia
law
in
this
particular
case.
for
instance
he
got
out
on
the
fisk
case
and
we
brought
in
dillard
in
the
matter
and
said,
oh
no
but
that
deals
with
another
section
yet
two
sections
are
linked
by
the
terminology
and
who
is
level
in
like
manner,
meaning
a
certain
operable
elements
discussed
in
dillard
would
obviously
bear
upon
this
particular
decision.
dillard
of
course
was
the
very
first
decision
indicate
that
this
was
confined
not
to
areas
that
annoyed
and
not
the
areas
that
were
disturbing,
but
to
actual
words
that
were
likely
to
invoke
a
breach
of
the
peace.
now
just
to
show
the
way
in
which
the
district
court
went
of,
it
said
that
for
instance
they
can
see
no
reason
constitutionally
for
protecting
the
kind
of
conduct
wilson
engaged
in.
but
it
went
on
to
say
it
is
construed
by
the
georgia
courts
especially
in
the
instant
case
that
georgia
provision
has
to
breach
the
peace
as
even
broader
than
louisiana
statute.
but
the
louisiana
statute
was
so
construed
that
it
applied
to
conduct
on
the
application
itself
that
ought
to
be
protected.
now,
he
cannot
cite
an
instance
in
which
this
is
going
to
apply
the
conduct
that
ought
to
be
protected,
but
it
follows
the
circular
pattern
of
reasoning
down
to
conclude
that
this
case
is
broader
than
cox
against
louisiana
which
i
simply
cannot
follow
the
reason.
in
other
words,
he
says
the
conduct
is
not
protected,
ought
not
to
be
protected,
cannot
be
made
unlawful,
in
contrary
we
have
a
situation
that
was
certainly
protective
type
conduct
involved
and
the
statute
was
construed
to
cover
it.
and
i
certainly
can
say
how
the
statute
as
construed
could
be
even
reached
the
conduct
involving
the
cox
against
louisiana.
we
have
a
whole
pattern
of
the
application.
we
have
the
same
civil
disobedient
situations
in
georgia
that
occurred
in
louisiana
and
to
my
knowledge
this
is
the
only
time
that
a
statute
has
ever
been
involved
in
a
case
that
arose
initially
out
of
the
civil
disobedience.
this
was
as
i
understand,
the
facts
was
a
demonstration
addressed
to
an
induction
center
of
the
united
states
army.
there
were
a
number
of
demonstrators
and
of
all
the
demonstrators,
only
wilson
fell
afoul
of
this
particular
statute.
surely,
the
demonstration,
and
knowing
the
army,
certainly
was
substantive
disruption
i
am
sure.
it
was
certain
sufficient
to
bring
the
police
department
out
to
see
what
was
appearing
in
the
area.
but
only
to
the
best
of
knowledge,
wilson
has
been
involved
in
this
particular
type
of
offense.
(voice
overlap)
it
is
not
drag
in
that
for
cutting
down
the
--
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
i
do
not
know
your
honor.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
well,
he
of
course
took
that
view,
but
there
is
not
a
basis
in
any
of
the
decisions
to
support
his
view.
in
other
words,
there
is
no
authority
in
georgia
that
would
apply
this
to
anything
other
than
this
particular
thing
that
i
would
call
as
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
fighting
words.
if
you
note
in
the
chaplinsky
statute,
you
have
this
question
raised
and
they
said
they
have
supplied
judicially
to
their
statute
one
of
the
very
same
things
that
is
in
the
statute.
it
was
written
into
it.
that
is
an
idea
of
tending
toward
the
breach
of
the
peace.
we
said
that
sure
you
could
not
come
out
and
say
an
outlaw
all
of
opprobrious
words.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
yes
sir
and
he
was
a
georgia
superior
court
judge.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
yes
sir.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
your
honor,
i
know
you
can
say
you
can
take
the
cases
as
they
are
and
read
them
and
decide
them.
i
think
judge
smith
made
a
gross
error.
we
would
not
have
this
case
up
here.
i
think
he
made
a
severe
mistake
on
georgia
law.
i
do
not
think
he
adequately
interpreted
it.
there
again
obviously
there
is
a
conflict
in
this
particular
situation
but
there
is
just
not
the
basis
--
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
we
have
judges
simpson,
morgan,
and
ingram
from
florida,
georgia
and
--
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
judge
simpson
and
(inaudible).
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
i
believe
he
is
from
jackson,
but
i
may
be
wrong.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
judge
lewis
morgan.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
and
we
have
one
judge
and
i
believe
from
texas
judge
ingram,
but
i
am
not
sure.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
during
the
argument
that
we
submitted
to
the
court,
there
was
not
any
real
consensus
among
the
judges.
there
was
not
anything
that
would
reflect
that
the
opinion
would
be
as
right
down
the
line
with
what
judge
smith
wrote.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
we
submitted
on
the
same
basis,
practically
the
same
brief.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
and
they
rejected
us.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
that
is
unfortunate
your
honor.
we
are
not
consulted
on
that
matter.
so
i
just
feel
it
and
of
course
the
court
is
going
to
have
to
take
the
authoritative
determinations
made
by
the
georgia
court
and
read
into
them
the
issues
that,
i
think,
brought
in
outside
by
misinterpreting
what
the
decisions
rely.
i
do
not
know
how
you
can
wipe
out
the
elmore
case
on
physical
resentment.
and
if
you
cannot
constitutionally
prohibit
this
kind
of
conduct
i
think
perhaps
that
smithâ€™s
real
view
was
that
we
were
prohibiting
conduct
that
it
fallen
not
so
much
if
he
was
misunderstanding
georgia
law,
but
he
was
misunderstanding
the
effect
which
this
decision
would
have
or
the
other
decisions
of
this
court.
personally
i
do
not
believe
this
statute
could
ever
reach
the
cantwell's
conduct.
i
doubt
very
seriously
if
it
could
ever
reach
say
feiner's
conduct,
in
feiner
against
new
york.
it
might
very
well
have
reached
the
conduct
of
a
man
mentioned
in
mr.
justice
douglasâ€™
concurring
opinion
who
was
calling
up
epitaphs
to
feiner
while
he
was
speaking.
it
might
under
the
circumstances.
that
would
be
a
question
we
would
have
to
look
at.
this
is
intentional
conduct.
it
is
directed
conduct.
it
directs
to
a
specific
victim.
it
is
intended
to
take
effect
upon
that
victim
and
it
is
intended
or
likely
to
produce
a
physical
resentment
from
him.
this
is
in
fighting
words
and
i
do
not
believe
any
legislature
under
the
country
can
find
fighting
words
other
than
fighting
words
and
there
again,
we
have
a
problem
of
what
is
the
standard.
the
final
point
i
would
make
your
honor
is
i
feel
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
approve
exactly
what
the
georgia
court
has
done,
georgia
decisions
have
construed
in
this
case
and
i
can
only
submit
it
to
your
review
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
thank
you.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
it
is
the
one
that
the
accompanies
the
georgia
approved
annotated
supplement
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
no
sir,
it
will
be
in
your
library
in
white
pamphlet.
you
go
for
the
green
one
then
you
will
find
an
old
2610.
there
is
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
this
and
6303
was
simply
moved
by
there.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
is
before
this
court
on
an
appeal
from
the
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
declaring
to
be
unconstitutional
upon
its
face,
a
georgia
statute
prescribing
the
unprovoked
use
to
or
of
another
and
in
his
presence
opprobrious
words
or
abuse
language,
tending
to
a
breach
of
the
peace.
unless
the
court
has
some
other
direction
it
would
like
to
give
me,
i
would
like
to
cover
basically
what
i
consider
to
be
the
points
of
drawing
issue
of
the
briefs
submitted
by
the
two
sides.
first
of
all,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
case
is
controlled
adversely
to
acquisition
by
the
decision
of
this
court
in
edwards
against
south
carolina.
i
would
seek
permission
from
the
court
to
add
one
additional
citation
to
what
i
consider
to
be
controlling
state
authority
only
on
substation
of
an
element
of
this
particular
offense
which
i
inadvertently
omitted
from
my
brief.
that
case
is
the
decision
of
garvin
against
the
mayor.

is
where
the
decision
is
covered.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
m-a-y-o-r.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
it
is
the
title
of
the
officer,
your
honor.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
it
is
controlling
unless
it
is
reverse
by
a
decision
of
supreme
court
of
georgia
which
would
mean
in
conflict
with
it,
in
other
words,
it
would
have
the
same
effect
on
the
trial
courts,
a
decision
of
a
court
of
appeals
sitting
in
that
circuit
upon
the
district
within
the
circuit.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
well,
we
only
have
one
court
of
appeal,
your
honor.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
that
sits
in
atlanta
and
it
has
statewide
jurisdiction.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
well,
i
am
not
really
all
that
familiar
with
the
facts
in
this
case
because
of
the
facial
question
that
was
presented.
we
did
not
go
into
a
great
detail
on
the
record
in
the
case.
i
feel
that
we
can
take
the
issues
that
were
raised
before
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
as
being
issues
that
were
raised
before
the
supreme
court.
in
other
words,
these
were
the
enumerations
of
the
questions
that
were
laid
before
the
state
court
for
determination.
the
district
court
found
for
instance
that
there
had
not
been
exhaustion
as
to
the
bulk
of
the
material
that
was
encompassed
within
the
application
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
refuse
to
consider
the
bulk
of
the
contentions
that
were
brought
forth
by
the
applicant,
the
appellee
here
at
that
point.
it
turned
only
on
the
facial
constitutionality
and
proceeded
from
there.
the
holding
in
the
case
that
i
have
just
called
the
courtâ€™s
attention
here
deals
with
the
question
of
the
broadness
of
the
concept
to
breach
of
the
peace
and
i
think
it
is
very
important
because
i
think,
georgia
at
this
point
departs
from
its
neighboring
state
of
south
carolina
to
a
very
significant
extent.
the
court
held
that
one
who
commits
a
breach
of
the
peace
is
of
course
guilty
of
disorderly
conduct,
but
they
went
on
to
say,
but
not
all
disorderly
conduct
is
necessarily
a
breach
of
the
peace.
that
is
where
its
merely
calculated
to
disturb
are
annoyed
and
i
would
submit
that
this
is
a
pretty
sound
analysis,
long
before
we
ever
gotten
to
this
area
of
severe
constitutional
questions
of
what
concerns
the
breaking
of
the
peace.
now
we
tend,
i
think
in
our
decisions
to
take
disruptions
of
the
peace
and
actual
breaches
of
the
peace
and
mix
them
all
together
and
of
course
that
is
the
bias
i
find
in
many
of
the
ordinances
and
statutes
and
common-law
offenses
as
we
find
in
state
courts
that
this
court
has
had
to
deal
with.
in
edwards
against
south
carolina,
we
have
a
case
where
the
offense
was
tainted
in
my
mind
by
the
circumstances
of
the
state
approved
application.
and
the
court
there
noted
the
state
could
not
make
criminal,
a
peaceful
expression
of
unpopular
views
and
that
was
the
width
to
which
the
breach
of
peace
definition
of
the
common-law
crime
adopted
by
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
took
the
situation.
the
court
went
on
to
note
and
i
think
rather
significantly
that
the
record
which
it
looked
at
in
the
south
carolina
case
was
barren
of
fighting
words
as
that
term
is
used
and
south
carolina
had
extended
the
concept
of
the
breach
of
peace
to
encompass
all
forms
of
disorderly
conduct,
including
conduct
which
was
merely
calculated
to
disturb
or
annoy
and
therein
was
a
vice
of
this
particular
common-law
offense.
i
think
we
really
get
into
a
very
similar
situation
in
cox
and
in
terminiello
against
chicago
where
we
have
an
application
by
state
courts
approved,
and
therefore,
becoming
an
authoritative
interpretation
of
the
ordinance
or
statute
involved
which
reaches
out
beyond
the
idea
of
breaching
the
peace
and
goes
to
the
disruption
of
the
peace
in
disturbing
or
annoying
antics,
conditions
of
words.
and
the
court
has
held
that
that
cannot
necessarily
be
consistent
with
the
first
amendment
made
unlawful.
the
decision
of
the
court
below
in
affecting
corporates
on
this
issue,
the
decision
of
the
district
court
and
i
was
really
somewhat
surprised
about
this
because
of
the
first
portion
of
the
opinion,
the
court
of
appeals
was
not
even
arguing
it.
the
first
question
was
just
submitted.
we
spent
the
entire
time
arguing
this
question.
they
ruled
on
the
first
issue
on
the
theory
that
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
should
have
the
benefit
of
the
court
of
appeals
determination
and
then
on
the
one
issue
that
was
really
controlling
the
case
did
not
give
us
any
real
benefit
of
their
determination.
they
--
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
yes
sir.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
yes
sir,
concurrent
with
count
3.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
that
is
also
under
the
statute.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
about
a
month
and
a
half.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
no
sir,
his
first
two
sentences
have
been
served
most
for
the
assault
and
battery
sentences.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
service
of
both
was
completed
before
the
application
for
which
it
was
filed
in
the
district
court
and
then
it
was
filed
on
the
basis
of
the
final
two
concurrent
sentences
which
(voice
overlap)
but
consecutive
with
the
first
two.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
that
would
be
correct.
count
3
would
be
consecutive
to
count
2.
that
is
one
of
the
counts
that
deals
with
this
particular
statute.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
three
not
one.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
yes
sir.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
good
time
took
care
of
the
difference.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
i
think
it
is
about
a
month-and-a-half.
i
have
not
computed
it
out,
but
he
has
time
left
on
the
sentence
at
the
time
of
writ
was
granted
and
he
was
committed
to
bail.
the
court
below,
the
district
court
seem
to
feel
there
was
regular
confusion
in
the
georgia
cases
in
this
area.
those
cases
are
authoritatively
construed
under
the
provision
under
attack.
i
think
there
was
a
rather
obvious
mistake
in
relying
upon
what
was
really
bare
bunk
style
of
disposals
of
questions
and
procedures
and
evidentiary
sufficiency
in
certain
cases.
this
resulted
in
fact
with
prior
to
1902
and
most
of
the
authority
in
this
case
came
out,
we
had
a
one
tier
appellate
court
system
in
georgia.
of
course,
there
was
a
tendency
to
take
a
decision
and
decided
on
exactly
what
was
brought
to
the
court
and
just
really
in
what
was
in
effect
an
order
on
the
case.
many
of
the
decisions
dealt
with
questions
of
provocation
and
for
reason
or
other
there
was
a
period
of
time
when
apparently
the
trial
courts,
when
instructing
the
jury
that
this
was
or
was
not
provocation.
well
of
course
provocation
is
not
a
defense
under
this
defense
and
lack
of
it.
it
is
an
element
which
a
state
must
prove
and
therefore
of
course
it
was
wrong
to
withdraw
this
question
from
the
jury
and
in
fact
shift
the
burden
to
the
defendant
of
coming
in
and
showing
that
a
certain
set
of
facts
was
provocation.
he
had
no
such
burden
in
any
evidence
he
brought
into
that
case
would
simply
go
against
the
state
to
prove
up
law
the
provocation
which
is
an
element
it
must
prove
under
this
offense.
so
i
think
when
we
view
the
offense
in
that
area,
actually
review
the
decision
as
opposed
to
the
language,
only
hang
up
on
the
language
of
some
disordered
propositions,
we
see
that
they
are
all
quite
consistent.
in
fisk
against
state
which
is
one
of
the
cases
that
they
indicate
they
feel
there
is
a
conflict
between
the
wilson
decision
some
63
years
later,
we
have
the
language
used
and
charges
soar
to
a
line
and
the
trial
judge
instructed
the
jury
that
this
was
opprobrious
words
and
abuse
of
language
and
the
court
said
no
you
cannot
do
that.
you
cannot
instruct
the
jury
as
to
an
element
of
the
offense
which
i
think
seems
pretty
obvious
that
you
cannot
tell
the
jury
that
this
person
has
violated
the
statute,
not
least
under
our
georgia
law
where
you
cannot
even
make
a
trial
judge
a
comment
on
it,
much
less
withdraw
in
a
criminal
case
have
fortunately
charge
or
the
offense
from
consideration
of
the
jury.
now
if
we
must
view
it
against
some
backdrop
of
what
is
really
involved
in
the
case,
the
decision
is
quite
clear
and
i
think
that
the
real
difference
in
the
quality
of
the
language
that
we
used
in
the
wilson
case
and
that
which
was
used
in
the
fisk
case.
there
are
certain
words
quite
obviously
are
going
to
be
opprobrious
or
abusive
if
used
to
another
person
as
what
the
supreme
court
said
without
a
smile
upon
your
face
so
to
speak
(inaudible).
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
i
think
it
is
the
use
of
the
abusive
language
to
the
other
person.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
i
think
it
will
be
a
violation
standard
by
itself,
your
honor.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
even
without
the
other
words
in
it.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
that
is
of
course
the
question
of
common
knowledge
and
understanding
of
what
is
it
when
it
is
used
under
those
circumstances.
i
would
think
it
would
intend
the
breach
of
the
peace
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
i
would
think
it
would
not.
i
mean,
as
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
and
understanding
of
hypothetical
reasonable
men
always
put
myself
in
just
being
hypothetical
reasonable
man,
but
it
may
not
be.
in
my
call,
maybe
that
son
of
a
gun
would
not
be
perhaps
or
words
that
would
tend
under
ordinary
circumstances
naturally.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
it
carries
out
a
much
heavier
connotation
i
think
or
higher
degree
of
opprobrium.
one
may
simply
be
offensive
or
not
desirable.
it
is
something
you
would
rather
not
have
said
to
you.
the
other
one
of
course
carries
with
it
a
degree
of
infamy
opprobriousness
or
whatever
fails.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
i
would
certainly
think
that.
a
crime
of
treason
is
an
infamies
crime
and
of
course
the
clearest
thing
i
could
say
if
i
have
to
come
in
and
try
to
equate
synonyms
and
i
do
not
think
you
can
ever
take
one
word
in
english
language
and
say
there
is
an
equal
for
it.
i
mean,
if
we
did
we
would
not
need
all
the
words
that
we
have,
but
a
program
probably
comes
closet
to
me
in
scarless.
it
probably
comes
closet
to
be
infamies
and
of
course
treason
is
an
infamies
crime,
at
least
in
my
mind
it
is,
and
i
think
the
common
knowledge
and
understanding
of
people,
treason
would
be
an
infamies
crime.
so
in
effect
what
you
are
saying
to
a
person
you
accuse
of
benedict
arnold
is
you
are
a
traitor
and
if
that
was
used
under
such
circumstances
to
a
person
that
the
backdrop
of
the
circumstances
were
such
that
is
ordinary
conditions
it
would
lead
to
a
breach
of
the
peace,
a
resentment
by
physical
violence
of
the
person
to
whom
is
directed
and
i
think
he
would
definitely
--
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
we
feel
that
this
statute
has
always
been
applied
to
exactly
that
kind
of
language.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
the
fighting
words
idea
and
if
you
review
all
the
decisions,
for
instance
you
swore
to
a
liable,
of
course,
this
came
out
of
backdrop
of
a
criminal
or
civil
procedure,
anyway
it
was
a
witness
to
him
this
was
directed.
this
of
course
is
charging
at
least
what
at
that
time
was
infamy
to
perjure
oneself
and
swear
to
a
lot.
i
would
think
that
would
be
an
opprobrious
word.
and
i
think
if
it
were
used
to
a
person
under
the
right
circumstances,
of
course,
it
would
likely
invoke
the
person
to
resent
by
--
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
no,
i
do
not
think
the
real
case
on
this
of
course,
the
georgia
court
of
appeals
case
in
elmore
which
was
in
1915
and
is
set
forth
in
our
brief.
this
is
really
one
of
the
few
cases
that
really
discusses
this
thing
at
the
kind
of
length
normally
an
appellate
court
discusses
it.
dillard
which
the
court
rejected
before
it
does
too.
i
think
it
is
perfectly
applicable.
there
are
really
only
two
what
you
might
call
extensive
discussions
of
the
principles
in
this
case.
in
an
elmore
they
really
emphasize
what
they
term
and
i
think
may
be
a
real
good
terminology
for
this
thing
the
court
talks
about
i
think
violent
reaction,
but
in
the
case
out
in
california,
in
cohen
versus
california
about
words
lack
and
reduce
a
violent
reaction.
they
are
talking
about
physical
resentment
and
i
think
in
context
of
the
statute
that
is
probably
the
best
terminology,
you
could
use
to
describe
what
you
are
talking
about.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
yes
sir.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
15
and
the
decision
is
--
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
it
is
the
elmore
case.
it
is
set
forth
in
our
brief
your
honor.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
they
talk
about
the
language
addressed
to
a
prisoner,
in
other
words,
here
is
a
person
in
a
cell.
now
obviously,
this
person
which
going
back
to
a
reasonable
ordinary
circumstance,
this
person
does
not
physically
at
that
moment
have
the
capability
to
resent
this
by
physical
violence,
but
he
is
protected
from
this
kind
of
language.
he
is
protected
by
the
bail
of
his
offense
and
then
subjected
to
abuse
of
opprobrious
language
under
these
circumstances
and
he
has
not
rendered
outside
the
pail
of
his
protection
simply
because
of
that
moment,
he
cannot
as
they
use
the
term
physically
resent.
well,
this
says
two
things.
one
it
says
a
necessity.
you
look
towards
physical
resentment.
the
potential
or
likely
good
are
they
as
determining
whether
or
not
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
statute.
obviously,
the
man
could
--
you
by
yelling
back
at
you.
people
in
--
he
could
do
many
things
that
might
be
disturbing,
but
he
cannot
do
one
thing
and
that
is
get
at
you,
but
he
is
still
protected
by
it.
and
they
went
all
to
talk
about
the
personally
opposite
bank
of
an
impassible
torrent.
they
talked
about
one
who
is
without
power
to
respond
immediately
to
such
vernal
insults
by
physical
retaliation
and
then
they
liken
it
perhaps
dramatically
to
a
paralytic
who
is
utterly
unable
to
break
the
peace
by
any
act
if
physical
violence
which
says
two
things.
one
that
they
are
looking
towards
the
physical
violence
idea
of
breaching
the
peace
and
secondly
that
you
are
looking
toward
an
ordinary
circumstance
situation
that
you
do
not
take
in
color
the
offense
by
the
nature
of
the
person
against
whom
this
particular
offense
is
rendered.
in
other
words,
it
is
not
a
question
of
person
being
highly
susceptible
to
this
or
another
person
not
being
susceptible
or
a
person
being
physically
overpowering
and
that
is
bully
your
pipes,
i
mean,
you
just
do
not
go
on
that
basis.
it
is
an
ordinary
circumstances
viewed
from
the
reasonable
man
hypothesis
and
therefore
a
paralytic
who
could
not
under
any
circumstances
resent
this
by
physical
violence
is
still
protected
by
this
particular
statute.
this
is
not
a
victimless
crime,
more
order
type
statute
is
protecting
a
particular
individual
that
is
a
person
who
is
a
victim
of
the
offense
to
whom
this
language
is
addressed
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
from
one
in
effect,
i
would
describe
as
a
verbal
assault.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
but
and
of
course
that
is
incorporated
by
statute
whereas
even
in
the
battery
situation
in
georgia,
the
words
could
come
in
for
the
purpose
of
perhaps
a
little
different
in
light
of
connotation
for
the
purpose
of
perhaps
being
a
justification
if
the
other
person
does
resent
by
physical
violence
as
to
rather
unusual
court
in
georgia
law,
but
is
in
there
nevertheless.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
no,
i
do
not
see
any
way
we
could.
if
we
describe
and
made
unlawful
binding
words,
somebody
be
up
here
continuing
if
that
was
not
applicable
to
bind.
there
may
be
200
ways
you
could
sit
down
and
describe
fighting
words.
the
court
i
think
in
one
of
the
last
cases
said
that
they
were
personally
abusive
epitaphs
which
one
addressed
to
the
ordinary
citizen
or
as
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
inherently
likely
to
provoke
violent
reaction.
the
georgia
legislature
back
during
the
reconstruction
really
contemporaneously
with
the
enactment
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
by
which
this
particular
statute
is
now
tried
to
find
in
terms
of
abusive
language
opprobrious
words
and
went
on
to
couple
together
the
elements.
there
is
no
history
that
would
indicate
that
this
has
ever
been
applied
to
anything
except
to
what
would
appear
from
common
knowledge
and
understanding
to
be
fighting
words.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
yes
sir.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
no
sir,
i
do
not
think
we
have
to
overrule
chaplinsky
because
chaplinsky
in
effect
said
that
fighting
words
--
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
oh
i
am
sorry
your
honor.
yes
i
am
so
used
to
sitting
from
the
other
side,
i
would
like
to
have
a
reverse
on
order,
affirmed.
now,
i
think
you
would
have
to
overrule
chaplinsky
or
at
least
make
such
an
extensive
exception
to
it
but
it
would
have
no
more
validity.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
there
has
never
been
that
determination
as
such
in
that
language,
your
honor.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
of
course,
it
went
on
the
district
court.
it
went
on
the
theory
and
it
talks
about
the
fact
that
that
this
could
be
equated
with
offensive
words
or
of
course
obviously
opprobrious
words,
abuse
of
language
would
be
offensive,
but
not
all
offensive
words
would
be
opprobrious
or
abusive.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
this
case
was
twisted
and
turned
--
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
but
i
have
a
little
difficulty
your
honor,
seeing
how
it
would
cover
in
conduct
that
would
be
otherwise
protected.
we
talk
about
fighting
words
and
--
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
not,
as
i
say,
i
feel
it
is
synonymous
with
fighting
words.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
look
at
the
way
in
which
judge
smith
went
about
it
though.
we
took
the
synonyms
that
were
out
of
the
dictionary
and
he
took
this
great
words
(voice
overlap)
at
least
it
has
--
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
well,
i
would
suggest
very
strongly
that
judge
smith
was
not
on
target
in
construing
the
georgia
law
in
this
particular
case.
for
instance
he
got
out
on
the
fisk
case
and
we
brought
in
dillard
in
the
matter
and
said,
oh
no
but
that
deals
with
another
section
yet
two
sections
are
linked
by
the
terminology
and
who
is
level
in
like
manner,
meaning
a
certain
operable
elements
discussed
in
dillard
would
obviously
bear
upon
this
particular
decision.
dillard
of
course
was
the
very
first
decision
indicate
that
this
was
confined
not
to
areas
that
annoyed
and
not
the
areas
that
were
disturbing,
but
to
actual
words
that
were
likely
to
invoke
a
breach
of
the
peace.
now
just
to
show
the
way
in
which
the
district
court
went
of,
it
said
that
for
instance
they
can
see
no
reason
constitutionally
for
protecting
the
kind
of
conduct
wilson
engaged
in.
but
it
went
on
to
say
it
is
construed
by
the
georgia
courts
especially
in
the
instant
case
that
georgia
provision
has
to
breach
the
peace
as
even
broader
than
louisiana
statute.
but
the
louisiana
statute
was
so
construed
that
it
applied
to
conduct
on
the
application
itself
that
ought
to
be
protected.
now,
he
cannot
cite
an
instance
in
which
this
is
going
to
apply
the
conduct
that
ought
to
be
protected,
but
it
follows
the
circular
pattern
of
reasoning
down
to
conclude
that
this
case
is
broader
than
cox
against
louisiana
which
i
simply
cannot
follow
the
reason.
in
other
words,
he
says
the
conduct
is
not
protected,
ought
not
to
be
protected,
cannot
be
made
unlawful,
in
contrary
we
have
a
situation
that
was
certainly
protective
type
conduct
involved
and
the
statute
was
construed
to
cover
it.
and
i
certainly
can
say
how
the
statute
as
construed
could
be
even
reached
the
conduct
involving
the
cox
against
louisiana.
we
have
a
whole
pattern
of
the
application.
we
have
the
same
civil
disobedient
situations
in
georgia
that
occurred
in
louisiana
and
to
my
knowledge
this
is
the
only
time
that
a
statute
has
ever
been
involved
in
a
case
that
arose
initially
out
of
the
civil
disobedience.
this
was
as
i
understand,
the
facts
was
a
demonstration
addressed
to
an
induction
center
of
the
united
states
army.
there
were
a
number
of
demonstrators
and
of
all
the
demonstrators,
only
wilson
fell
afoul
of
this
particular
statute.
surely,
the
demonstration,
and
knowing
the
army,
certainly
was
substantive
disruption
i
am
sure.
it
was
certain
sufficient
to
bring
the
police
department
out
to
see
what
was
appearing
in
the
area.
but
only
to
the
best
of
knowledge,
wilson
has
been
involved
in
this
particular
type
of
offense.
(voice
overlap)
it
is
not
drag
in
that
for
cutting
down
the
--
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
i
do
not
know
your
honor.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
well,
he
of
course
took
that
view,
but
there
is
not
a
basis
in
any
of
the
decisions
to
support
his
view.
in
other
words,
there
is
no
authority
in
georgia
that
would
apply
this
to
anything
other
than
this
particular
thing
that
i
would
call
as
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
fighting
words.
if
you
note
in
the
chaplinsky
statute,
you
have
this
question
raised
and
they
said
they
have
supplied
judicially
to
their
statute
one
of
the
very
same
things
that
is
in
the
statute.
it
was
written
into
it.
that
is
an
idea
of
tending
toward
the
breach
of
the
peace.
we
said
that
sure
you
could
not
come
out
and
say
an
outlaw
all
of
opprobrious
words.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
yes
sir
and
he
was
a
georgia
superior
court
judge.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
yes
sir.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
your
honor,
i
know
you
can
say
you
can
take
the
cases
as
they
are
and
read
them
and
decide
them.
i
think
judge
smith
made
a
gross
error.
we
would
not
have
this
case
up
here.
i
think
he
made
a
severe
mistake
on
georgia
law.
i
do
not
think
he
adequately
interpreted
it.
there
again
obviously
there
is
a
conflict
in
this
particular
situation
but
there
is
just
not
the
basis
--
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
we
have
judges
simpson,
morgan,
and
ingram
from
florida,
georgia
and
--
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
judge
simpson
and
(inaudible).
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
i
believe
he
is
from
jackson,
but
i
may
be
wrong.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
judge
lewis
morgan.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
and
we
have
one
judge
and
i
believe
from
texas
judge
ingram,
but
i
am
not
sure.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
during
the
argument
that
we
submitted
to
the
court,
there
was
not
any
real
consensus
among
the
judges.
there
was
not
anything
that
would
reflect
that
the
opinion
would
be
as
right
down
the
line
with
what
judge
smith
wrote.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
we
submitted
on
the
same
basis,
practically
the
same
brief.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
and
they
rejected
us.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
that
is
unfortunate
your
honor.
we
are
not
consulted
on
that
matter.
so
i
just
feel
it
and
of
course
the
court
is
going
to
have
to
take
the
authoritative
determinations
made
by
the
georgia
court
and
read
into
them
the
issues
that,
i
think,
brought
in
outside
by
misinterpreting
what
the
decisions
rely.
i
do
not
know
how
you
can
wipe
out
the
elmore
case
on
physical
resentment.
and
if
you
cannot
constitutionally
prohibit
this
kind
of
conduct
i
think
perhaps
that
smithâ€™s
real
view
was
that
we
were
prohibiting
conduct
that
it
fallen
not
so
much
if
he
was
misunderstanding
georgia
law,
but
he
was
misunderstanding
the
effect
which
this
decision
would
have
or
the
other
decisions
of
this
court.
personally
i
do
not
believe
this
statute
could
ever
reach
the
cantwell's
conduct.
i
doubt
very
seriously
if
it
could
ever
reach
say
feiner's
conduct,
in
feiner
against
new
york.
it
might
very
well
have
reached
the
conduct
of
a
man
mentioned
in
mr.
justice
douglasâ€™
concurring
opinion
who
was
calling
up
epitaphs
to
feiner
while
he
was
speaking.
it
might
under
the
circumstances.
that
would
be
a
question
we
would
have
to
look
at.
this
is
intentional
conduct.
it
is
directed
conduct.
it
directs
to
a
specific
victim.
it
is
intended
to
take
effect
upon
that
victim
and
it
is
intended
or
likely
to
produce
a
physical
resentment
from
him.
this
is
in
fighting
words
and
i
do
not
believe
any
legislature
under
the
country
can
find
fighting
words
other
than
fighting
words
and
there
again,
we
have
a
problem
of
what
is
the
standard.
the
final
point
i
would
make
your
honor
is
i
feel
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
approve
exactly
what
the
georgia
court
has
done,
georgia
decisions
have
construed
in
this
case
and
i
can
only
submit
it
to
your
review
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
thank
you.
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
it
is
the
one
that
the
accompanies
the
georgia
approved
annotated
supplement
mr.
courtney
wilder
stanton
no
sir,
it
will
be
in
your
library
in
white
pamphlet.
you
go
for
the
green
one
then
you
will
find
an
old
2610.
there
is
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
this
and
6303
was
simply
moved
by
there.
