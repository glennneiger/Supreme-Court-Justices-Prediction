how
do
you
spell
that?
unknown

84
southeast?
unknown
speaker
yes,
91?
unknown
speaker
the
appellees,
garvin
against
the?
unknown
speaker
m-a-y-o-r?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask?
unknown
speaker
looking
at
such
an
unusual
history,
apparently
he
got
a
concurrent
sentence
on
this
count
3?
unknown
speaker
and
count
3
has
had
also
under
this
statute?
unknown
speaker
and
on
that
i
see.
so
he
has
been
bailed.
he
is
still
--
that
bail
of
august
11,
1969,
then
he
still
if
he
loses
he
still
has
–-
unknown
speaker
about
a
month
and
a
half.
so
there
is
no
concurrent
sentence
problem
here?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
year
on
each
degree?
so
that
were
actually,
is
aggregate
with
three
years
(voice
overlap)
to
get
counts
1
and
2
and
a
year
on
count
3
and
on
4
to
be
served
concurrently
with
3?
unknown
speaker
so
that
would
be
three
years?
unknown
speaker
and
he
started
serving
on
april
15,
1968
and
he
submitted
the
bail
on
aug
11,
1969.
unknown
speaker
and
he
still
has
some
time
to
serve
if
he
prevails?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
the
essence
of
the
it
here
the
epitaphs
or
the
i
will
choke
you
to
death.
if
you
ever
put
your
hands
on
me
again,
i
will
cut
you
all
to
pieces.”
unknown
speaker
or
is
the
epitaph
standing
alone,
is
that
a
violation?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words
that
would
have
been
asked?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
then
you
son
of
a
gun?
unknown
speaker
would
it
or
would
not?
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
say
bitch
instead
of
gun
then
it
is--
unknown
speaker
was
judge
smith,
a
georgia
partitioner
before
he
came
to
the
bench?
unknown
speaker
state
judge?
unknown
speaker
i
guess
he
knows
a
lot
more
about
georgia
law
than
i
do,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
who
is
from
florida?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
who
is
from
georgia?
unknown
speaker
lewis
morgan?
unknown
speaker
now,
but
did
you
submit
to
the
court
of
appeal
that
judge
smith's
understanding
the
georgia
law
was
an
error?
unknown
speaker
and
he
is
not
a
georgia
judge
sitting
there?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
what
you
are
saying
i
gather
is,
even
if
as
you
reach
the
very
words,
they
fall
within
chaplinsky,
the
overbreadth
of
statute
keeps
him
standing
with
in
fact
the
entire
statute,
even
though
as
applied
to
him
it
might
be
constitutional?
unknown
speaker
even
if
it
were?
unknown
speaker
is
that
not
adoption
has
the
reason
to
be
applied?
unknown
speaker
how
could
you
argue
with
(inaudible)
in
light
of
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
they
would
part
of
an
assault?
unknown

your
client
is

and
then
how
did
he
get
to
the
(inaudible)
with
the
white
man?
unknown
speaker
a
police
officer?
unknown
speaker
where
was
–-
what
was
certain
point?
unknown
speaker
he
also
was
prosecuted
and
convicted
for
a
federal
offense
for
this?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
what
were
they
flaunting
at
is
the
fact
that
they
gave.
you
cannot
say
that
georgia
court
tends
anytime
you
say
these
words
unknown
speaker
what
they
need
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
that
was
an
accident
response
to
the
