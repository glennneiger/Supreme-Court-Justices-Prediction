how
about
a

justice
byron

white
and
you
would
think
the
statute
would
cover
a
situation
where
a
man
calls
out
to
a
bookstore
and
says
please
send
me
over
--
please
mail
to
me
a
copy
of
so
and
so
and
it's
mailed
to
him?
justice

so
you
don't
think
that
would
be
constitutional?
justice
byron

white
well,
reidel
was
going
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
that

it
authorized
seizure
of
an
allegedly
obscene

in
the
mail
is
addressed
to
a
user
and
would
have
stanley
rights
if
he
ever
got
it
inside
his
house?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
you
put
the
stanley
on
the
fourth
amendment,
then
concededly,
they
can
get
a
search
warrant
and
seize
it?
