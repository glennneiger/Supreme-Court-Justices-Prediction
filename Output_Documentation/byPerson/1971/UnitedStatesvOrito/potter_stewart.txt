justice
potter
stewart
in
this
case,
mr.
greenawalt
all
we
have
do
far
as
the
facts
go
is
the
indictment
which
appears
on
page
1,
and
2
of
the
appendix,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
no
affidavits
of
--
?
justice
potter
stewart
exactly
or
as
to
the
--
not
only
as
to
the
nature
of
the
material
but
as
to
the
purpose
of
the
defendant's
transportation
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
we
have
the
indictment
and
then
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
that's
it.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
greenawalt,
earlier
in
your
arguments
you
gave
us
a
citation
332
f.
supp.
833,
as
i
got
it
at
least,
and
i
set
to
that
and
i
think
it's
not
the
correct
citation.
during
the
lunch
period,
could
you
check
it?
justice
potter
stewart
just
tell
me
the
once,
if
you
could.
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
just
going
back
to
your
last
point,
you
say
that
there
have
been
scores
of
convictions
under
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
we
would
be
concerned
here
of
course,
of
people
who
were
serving
sentences
i
suppose?
justice
potter
stewart
we
are
not
talking
about
convictions
of
30
years
ago.
justice
potter
stewart
the
collateral
challenge?
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
know
how
many
--
i
suppose
a
typical
prison
sentence
would
be
like,
well,
what
is
it
maximum
five
years?
justice
potter
stewart
i
was
just
wandering
about
the
practical
impact
of
the
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
before
you
proceed
mr.
solicitor
general,
looking
just
at
the
face
of
the
indictment
in
the
appendix
in
the
present
case,
is
it
clear
to
you?
it
certainly
isn’t
to
me
offhand
that
this
involved
air
express.
it
says
that
the
defendant
did
knowingly
transport
and
carry
at
interstate
commerce
from
san
francisco
to
milwaukee
and
so
on.
these
materials
by
common
carrier
that
is
trans
world
airlines
and
north
central
airlines
and
i
would
supposed
that
those
words
could
be
even
more
readily
read
as
that
he
took
them
with
him
on
his
own
trip.
justice
potter
stewart
though
all
we
have
in
the
record,
i
think
--
justice
potter
stewart
transport
and
carry.
carry.
justice
potter
stewart
because
of
unlimited
weight
these
days
on
domestic
airlines.
justice
potter
stewart
well
one
can
carry
with
you
on
domestic
airlines
these
days.
justice
potter
stewart
anyway,
it
is
not
clear
that
this
was
in
shipment.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
can’t
you
--
to
all
cases
like
pollack
and
so
on
indicate
that
there’s
an
affirmative
right
on
your
--
that
your
neighbor
in
the
airplane
has
or
anybody
else
has
not
to
read?
doesn’t
the
first
amendment
include
the
right
not
to
read
and
not
to
listen
to
what
you
don’t
want
to
read?
justice
potter
stewart
and
don’t
want
to
listen
to?
justice
potter
stewart
more
than
just
to
--
but
there
was
the
dissent
in
pollack
in
the
opinion.
justice
potter
stewart
in
any
event,
it’s
been
suggested
that
[voice

justice
potter
stewart
include
the
right
not
to
read.
justice
potter
stewart
what
it
does
is
authorize
the
government
to
prevent
you
from
poking
your
neighbor
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
you’re
shoving
this
under
his
nose,
and
that’s
the
first
amendment.
