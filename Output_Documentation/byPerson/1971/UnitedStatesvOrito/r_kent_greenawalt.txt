mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
on
direct
appeal
from
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
wisconsin.
the
court
dismissed
an
indictment
charging
that
appellee
had
transported
82
reels
of
obscene
film
interstate
by
means
of
a
common
carrier.
the
court
held
that
the
relevant
statutory
provision,
18
u.s.c.
section
1462
is
on
its
face
constitutionally
invalid
because
it
is
overbroad
in
forbidding
the
use
of
common
carriers
for
the
non-public
transportation
of
obscene
material
the
government
appealed
directly
to
this
court
pursuant
to
the
old
criminal
appeals
act.
like
reidel
and
thirty-seven
photographs
and
the
case
just
argued,
this
case
arises
from
an
expansive
interpretation
of
stanley
versus
georgia
by
the
district
court.
precise
issue
in
this
case,
is
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
that
prohibits
the
knowing
use
of
a
common
carrier
for
the
interstate
transportation
of
obscene
material.
we
believe
that
reidel
and
thirty-seven
photographs
have
effectively
settled
the
issues
raised
here.
indeed,
the
judge
who
decided
this
case
has
subsequently
sustained
the
constitutionality
of
this
section
after
those
cases
were
handed
down.
that
is
not
cited
in
our
briefs
and
the
citation
to
that
case
is
united
states
versus
zacher
332
f.
supp.
833.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
833,
yes
your
honor.
in
trying
to
evade
the
clear
import
of
reidel
and
thirty-seven
photographs,
appellee
makes
two
different
arguments.
one
is
that
even
when
transportation
is
for
the
purpose
of
sale,
congress
cannot
prohibit
the
use
of
common
carriers
to
transport
obscene
materials
interstate.
the
second
argument
assumes
that
commercial
transportation
maybe
forbidden,
but
contends
that
the
statute
is
invalid
as
it
applies
to
non-commercial
transportation
and
that
this
impermissible
overbreadth
renders
the
entire
section
invalid
on
its
face.
it
is
the
government's
position
that
the
statute
is
constitutional
in
both
its
commercial
and
non-commercial
applications.
if
however,
it
is
considered
unconstitutional
in
some
or
all
non-commercial
applications,
it
is
our
position
that
the
statute
should
not
be
declared
invalid
on
its
face,
but
limited
to
its
permissible
application.
i
turn
first
to
the
argument
that
even
transportation
for
sale
is
constitutionally
protected.
in
reidel,
as
court
refused
to
recognize
a
constitutional
right
to
distribute
or
sell
obscene
materials
and
reiterated
the
principle
of
roth
that
obscenity
and
its
distribution
are
outside
the
reach
of
the
first
amendment.
in
thirty-seven
photographs,
six
justices
squarely
held
that
importation
of
obscenity
for
commercial
distribution
is
not
constitutionally
protected.
appellee
concedes
that
the
first
amendment
would
not
protect
the
commercial
distributor
of
obscene
materials
who
wishes
to
import
such
materials
or
send
them
through
the
mails,
but
he
argues
that
the
same
commercial
distributor
who
wishes
to
transport
materials
in
interstate
commerce
is
constitutionally
protected.
congress'
plenary
power
to
prohibit
not
just
materials
from
flowing
in
interstate
commerce,
has
long
been
a
cornerstone
of
this
court's
interpretation
of
the
commerce
clause.
in
gibbons
versus
ogden,
the
court
said
that
congress'
power
over
commerce
among
the
states
is
vested,
“as
absolutely
as
it
would
be
in
a
single
government.”
and
in
the
lottery
cases
as
well
as
many
others,
it
has
sustained
absolute
prohibitions
against
items
of
commerce
judged
harmful.
in
hope
versus
united
states
which
is
cited
in
our
briefs,
where
the
court
sustained
the
white
slave
traffic
act,
the
court
assumed
the
constitutionality
of
these
provisions
and
used
those
as
a
premise
to
reach
the
result
in
that
case.
congress'
powers
over
commerce
are
of
course,
limited
by
the
first
amendment,
but
the
first
amendment
is
also
relevant
to
what
congress
can
preclude
from
the
mails
or
forbid
from
being
imported.
appellee
cites
a
number
of
cases
for
the
proposition
that
the
government
has
special
powers
over
mail
because
it
operates
the
postal
system.
but
in
this
first
amendment
context
at
least,
these
cases
have
no
authority
after
blount
versus
rizzi
and
lamont
versus
postmaster
general.
the
government
can
no
more
exclude
protected
materials
from
the
mail
on
the
basis
of
their
content,
but
it
can
exclude
them
from
commerce.
and
conversely
if
commercial
distribution
of
obscenity
through
the
mails
can
be
prohibited,
so
also
can
any
sort
of
transportation
in
interstate
commerce
for
commercial
purposes.
assuming
that
congress
may
validly
prohibit
the
use
of
common
carriers
traveling
interstate
for
the
commercial
distribution
of
obscene
materials,
the
order
of
the
district
court
in
this
case
should
be
reversed
either
if
transportation
for
personal
use
may
also
be
prohibited
or
if
invalidity
as
to
transportation
for
personal
use
does
not
require
striking
down
the
entire
section.
we
believe
the
statute
is
constitutional
in
it's
non-commercial
as
well
it's
the
commercial
applications.
but
i
consider
the
overbreadth
point
first
because
we
believe
it's
clearly
controlled
by
thirty-seven
photographs.
first,
i
would
like
to
clear
up
what
seems
to
be
an
issue
from
appellee's
brief,
but
is
not
really
an
issue.
we
do
contend
that
it
is
inappropriate
to
hold
this
section
invalid
on
its
face,
but
we
do
not
contend
that
appellee
lacks
standing
to
make
that
claim.
appellee
does
have
standing
to
make
the
claim
that
invalidity
in
some
applications
renders
the
section
invalid
for
all
applications,
whether
or
not
he
is
a
commercial
distributor.
if
on
the
other
hand,
as
we
contend,
invalidity
in
some
applications
would
not
render
the
statute
invalid
as
to
all
applications,
then
the
district
court
could
determine
in
subsequent
proceedings
in
this
case,
the
purpose
of
the
transportation
here.
in
neither
of
that
is
this
court
required
to
determine
appellee's
purpose
from
this
record,
so
that
really
is
not
an
issue
at
this
point
in
the
case.
in
thirty-seven
photographs,
the
same
six
justices
who
held
that
importation
for
commercial
purposes
could
be
prohibited,
also
held
that
the
district
court
in
that
case
was
wrong
to
strike
down
the
entire
section
in
its
application
to
commercial
importation
because
importation
for
personal
use
might
be
constitutionally
protected.
mr.
justice
white's
majority
in
plurality
opinion
said,
“the
proper
approach
was
not
to
invalidate
the
section
in
its
entirety,
but
to
construe
it
narrowly
and
hold
it
valid
in
its
application
to
luros”
and
justices
harlan
and
stewart
concurred
on
the
same
ground.
as
these
opinions
indicate,
a
holding
of
facial
invalidity
for
overbreadth
is
not
appropriate
when
a
statute
can
be
clearly
narrowed
to
constitutional
applications
in
a
way
that
will
eliminate
virtually
all
of
the
possible
chilling
effect
on
protected
communication.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
as
to
the
nature
of
these
materials.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
that
is
correct.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
that
is
right,
yes
sir.
as
far
as
the
overbreadth
point
is
concerned,
the
language
of
section
1462
involved
in
this
case
is
virtually
indistinguishable
from
the
language
of
section
1305
(a)
involved
in
thirty-seven
photographs.
section
1462
involved
here
forbids
the
use
of
common
carriers
to
transport
obscenity
interstate
without
respect
to
purpose,
just
as
section
1305
(a)
that
provided
forfeiture
for
importation
of
obscene
material
without
respect
to
purpose.
section
1462
dates
back
to
1897
and
it
is
the
primary
prohibition
against
interstate
transport
of
obscene
materials
in
the
federal
law.
it
is
clear
that
congress
would
prefer
this
section
sustained
in
its
valid
applications
rather
than
being
declared
invalid
on
its
face.
and
this
case
does
not
involve
the
kind
of
interrelated
set
of
administrative
provisions
such
as
were
present
in
blount
versus
rizzi
and
freedman
versus
maryland.
in
those
kinds
of
cases,
the
court
declines
to
rewrite
an
administrative
setup
that
defines
certain
provisions
constitutionally
invalid,
but
here
we
have
a
straightforward
criminal
statute
that
can
be
validly
applied
in
certain
applications
and
plainly
the
lower
court
erred
in
striking
down
the
entire
section
on
its
face.
we
believe
the
court
also
erred
in
quite
a
different
respect
by
deciding
that
interstate
transportation
of
obscenity
for
personal
use
could
not
constitutionally
be
proscribed.
we
now
get
back
to
territory
that's
been
covered
in
the
previous
argument
to
some
extent.
reidel
and
thirty-seven
photographs
made
clear
as
had
roth
that
obscenity
is
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment
and
congressional
power
to
decide
what
goods
may
cross
state
lines
extends
to
this
unprotected
material.
what
the
plurality
said
in
thirty-seven
photographs
with
respect
to
foreign
commerce,
a
passage
that
the
solicitor
general
read
to
you
in
his
argument,
“obscene
materials
may
be
removed
from
the
channels
of
commerce
even
though
intended
solely
for
private
use
is
equally
true
of
interstate
commerce.”
the
majority
opinion
in
stanley
versus
georgia
indicates
that
the
government
may
not
invade
a
person's
home
to
ascertain
if
he
possesses
forbidden
material.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
our
position
would
be
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
that,
that
could
be
forbidden.
this
section
covers
only
transportation
by
common
carrier
and
1465
would
be
the
relevant
federal
section
for
that,
i
think
that
in
terms
of
transportation
for
sale
or
distribution,
yes.
now
then
i
suppose
you
have
a
nice
statutory
question
as
to
whether
if
you
give
a
book
to
a
friend,
that's
distribution
or
not,
within
the
terms
of
the
statute?
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
that
is
clear
your
honor
that
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
stature
and
certainly
there
would
be
a
strong
statutory
argument
that,
that
would
not
be
distribution
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
for
somebody
who
didn't
start
in
the
district
of
columbia,
well,
i
would
think
that
is
not
distribution.
it
is
our
position
that
if
it
is
obscene
material
and
someone
used
a
common
carrier
to
give
the
material
to
the
library
of
congress
then
unless
you
read
in
a
statutory
exception
for
that
kind
of
thing
that
could
constitutionally
be
covered.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
yes,
yes
that's
right.
we
would
say
that
constitutionally
it
could
be
covered.
for
similar
reasons
that
we
think
that
if
there
was
a
town
that
which
there
maybe,
in
which
canada
and
united
states
would
split
the
border,
we
think
that
that
could
be
covered
as
well.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
did
you
find
it
mr.
justice
douglas?
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
yes,
certainly.
well,
it
is
our
content
that
stanley
versus
georgia
--
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
alright,
i
am
sorry
i
will
check
that
--
does
not
require
the
government
to
stand
aside
for
the
channels
of
commerce
are
employed
by
individuals
who
are
interested
in
constitutionally
unprotected
material.
moreover,
the
government
does
have
a
special
interest
in
the
use
of
common
carriers
which
are
open
to
the
general
public
and
closely
regulated
in
the
public
interest.
if
persons
choose
to
use
such
carriers,
they
must
do
so
in
ways
not
deemed
inconsistent
with
the
public
interest.
practically,
there
are
substantial
reasons
for
allowing
the
government
to
forbid
the
use
of
common
carriers
to
transport
obscenity
irrespective
of
purported
purpose,
reasons
that
we
do
not
believe
were
applicable
on
stanley.
each
state
legislature
has
the
power
to
set
it's
on
policy
with
respect
to
the
sale
and
purchase
of
obscene
material.
one
state
may
forbid
the
sale
of
all
constitutionally
unprotected
material.
another
may
permit
their
sale,
as
oregon
has
chosen
to
do.
if
the
federal
government
is
powerless
to
stop
transportation
across
the
state
lines
--
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
had
mis-transcribed
one
of
the
page
numbers
and
it's
332
f.
supp
883,
instead
of
833
as
i
have
said
before.
i
was
in
the
middle
of
the
argument
that
this
statute
is
constitutional
as
it
reaches
non-commercial
transportation
and
i
have
made
the
basic
argument
that
the
material
is
unprotected
and
therefore
congress
can
prohibit
its
passage
in
interstate
commerce
and
i
turn
to
some
of
the
practical
reasons
that
support
that
conclusion.
and
i
have
mentioned
that
state
legislatures
may
forbid
constitutionally
unprotected
material
from
being
sold,
but
that
other
states
may
permit
their
sales
such
as
oregon
has
chosen
to
do
and
that
if
the
federal
government
is
powerless
to
stop
transportation
across
the
state
lines,
citizens
of
a
state
that
forbids
the
purchase
of
pornography
can
circumvent
that
policy
of
that
state
by
buying
material
in
a
more
permissive
jurisdiction
and
bringing
it
back
to
their
own
state.
more
significant
perhaps
in
terms
of
actual
impact
on
prosecutions
is
the
fact
that
if
only
commercial
transportation
maybe
stopped,
it
may
sometimes
be
difficult
to
prove
a
commercial
motive
although
that
is
the
real
reason
for
the
transportation
and
i
remind
you
of
the
solicitor
general's
argument
about
the
difficulties
of
drawing
that
particular
line.
also,
in
this
situation,
a
holding
of
constitutional
protection
of
private
transportation
would
cast
a
jeopardy,
scores
of
convictions
under
1462
where
transportation
was
in
fact
for
commercial
purposes,
but
in
which
the
jury
determination
of
guilt
of
course,
did
not
require
a
finding
to
that
effect.
finally,
there
is
the
danger
that
materials
taken
by
common
carriers
will
be
seen
by
other
members
of
the
public
who
maybe
offended.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
i
am
informed
that
there
are
approximately
25
prosecutions
a
year
under
1462,
anything
in
that
range.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
yeah,
and
then
all
problems
about
collateral
attack
--
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
well,
except
that
the
court's
rule
is
now
about
mootness
or
rather
liberal
toward
people
that
have
been
convicted
of
crimes
and
their
ability
to
challenge
crimes
that
might
have
adverse
effects
in
some
future
proceedings.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
yeah,
even
though
they
are
out
of
prison.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
for
first
offenders,
there
is
maximum
of
ten
years
for
second
defender,
but
i
would
guess,
as
i
think
you
are
suggesting
that
the
usual
sentence
is
not
terribly
long.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
i
don't
know
about
the
average
sentences,
or
how
many
people
are
still
in
jail.
the
wisdom
of
trying
to
stop
transportation
for
private
use
may
be
argued
well
and
in
fact,
the
government
does
not
prosecute
those
whom
it
believes
are
transporting
for
personal
use.
but
it
is
our
contention
that
there
is
no
constitutional
bar
to
set
the
prosecution
because
section
1462
is
patently
constitutional
as
to
use
of
common
carriers
to
transport
obscenity
for
sale
and
both
because
its
coverage
of
transportation
for
personal
use
is
also
constitutional
and
because
the
proper
approach,
if
the
section
is
unconstitutional
in
some
applications
is
to
limit
the
section
rather
than
invalidate
it
on
its
face,
the
order
of
the
district
court
in
this
case
should
be
reversed
and
the
indictment
should
be
reinstated.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
only
a
few
very
brief
comments.
i
don't
think
this
issue
was
raised
by
this
case,
but
i
think
that
what
may
seem
to
be
the
troublesome
hypothetical
of
someone
who
carries
in
his
pocket
one
obscene
book,
there
is
i
think
a
question
as
to
whether
the
statute
that
covers
that
person.
the
language
in
the
statute
reported
in
the
1955
revision
i
believe
was
deposit
with
the
common
carrier
and
the
change
in
language
was
designed
to
extend
the
venue
of
provision
so
that
people
could
be
prosecuted
at
jurisdictions
which
they
travel
through
as
well
as
the
place
that
they
had
put
the
materials
on
the
carriers.
so
i
think
there
might
be
an
argument
that
use
of
a
common
carrier
doesn't
cover
that
situation.
i
don't
say
that;
that's
right,
and
we
don't
think
--
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
that
--
and
assuming
that
it's
in
another
state,
the
country
home,
that
is
clearly
covered
by
the
statute
and
we
think
that
the
statute
is
constitutional
in
that
application.
we
go
back
to
our
original
argument
on
that
point,
and
this
possible
distinction
i
am
suggesting,
we
don't
suggest
it
in
constitutional
intervention.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
well,
if
the
owner
of
a
common
--
i
mean
if
a
guy
drives
his
own
bus
whether
that's
still
a
common
carrier,
i
am
not
sure,
so
there
would
be
that
question
as
to
whether
it's
a
common
carrier
we
are
putting.
if
the
owner
of
the
railroad
gets
on
his
own
train,
then
that's
covered.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
if
that's
still
a
common
carrier,
yes,
he
has
and
i
think
it
would
be,
no.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
there
is
a
separate
provision
for
mail.
i
mean,
if
its'
set
by
--
that's
1461.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
oh
absolutely,
i
mean
reidel
makes
that
clear
i
should
think.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
oh
well,
yes
we
do
think
that
if
there
is
not
a
right
to
sell,
there
is
also
not
a
right
to
buy.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
we
think
that
prosecution
could
be
brought
against
the
purchaser.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
that
is
correct.
in
other
words,
if
you
set
off
a
book
company
asking
them
to
send
you
something,
and
it
was
sent
to
you,
we
don't
think
there
would
been
a
constitutional
bar
to
constitute
the
purchaser
as
well
the
seller.
on
the
severability
point,
i'd
like
to
suggest
the
language
of
united
states
versus
jackson
390
us
570,
in
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
stewart,
at
footnote
on
page
585,
he
says
--
the
court
said,
whatever
relevance
in
such
an
explicit
clause
may
have
in
creating
a
presumption
of
severability,
the
ultimate
determination
of
severability
will
rarely
turn
the
presence
or
absence
of
such
a
clause.
we
think
it's
clear
that
whatever
this
specific
language
of
the
severability
provision,
basically
the
question
is
trying
to
ascertain
congressional
intent
as
to
what
--the
remainder
of
the
statute
preserved
or
not.
finally,
as
to
the
legislative
history
that's
been
suggested
there
seems
to
me
the
major
defect
with
the
argument
as
has
been
made
is
that
the
conclusion
doesn't
follow
up
on
the
premise.
it
is
clearly
true
that
congress
does
mean
to
cover
non-commercial
transportation,
but
it
does
not
follow
from
that;
but
if
it
has
to
have
only
commercial
transportation
or
nothing
at
all,
that
it
would
choose
nothing
at
all
and
that
really
is
the
question
here
on
the
overbreadth
point.
i
might
mention
that
because
i
think
in
the
sense
this
supports
another
point
we
were
making
that
this
provision,
well
first
of
all,
the
original
1897
statute
did
not,
if
you
deposited
the
material
in
the
common
carrier,
there
was
no
requirement
of
wanting
to
sell
it
or
distribute
it,
it
was
only
the
person
who
took
the
material
from
the
common
carrier
that
had
the
limit
that
my
brother
has
mentioned.
so
that
is
relevant
to
receiver,
not
to
the
person
who
deposited
the
material.
secondly,
in
1909
when
this
change
was
made,
a
similar
change
was
made
as
to
section
1461
and
the
congressional
record
in
the
house
indicates
that
the
reason
that
the
change
was
made
was
because
it
was
very
difficult
to
prove
the
element
that
was
required
in
showing
the
purpose
of
a
person
who
was
receiving
the
material
from
the
common
carrier.
so
that
the
words
were
eliminated
to
eliminate
a
difficult
element
of
proof
and
i
think
that
supports
our
argument
that
to
draw
that
constitutional
distinction
does
create
a
difficult
element
of
proof
which
congress
has
not
wished
to
impose
and
which
is
not
required
by
any
of
this
court's
decision.
thank
you.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
on
direct
appeal
from
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
wisconsin.
the
court
dismissed
an
indictment
charging
that
appellee
had
transported
82
reels
of
obscene
film
interstate
by
means
of
a
common
carrier.
the
court
held
that
the
relevant
statutory
provision,
18
u.s.c.
section
1462
is
on
its
face
constitutionally
invalid
because
it
is
overbroad
in
forbidding
the
use
of
common
carriers
for
the
non-public
transportation
of
obscene
material
the
government
appealed
directly
to
this
court
pursuant
to
the
old
criminal
appeals
act.
like
reidel
and
thirty-seven
photographs
and
the
case
just
argued,
this
case
arises
from
an
expansive
interpretation
of
stanley
versus
georgia
by
the
district
court.
precise
issue
in
this
case,
is
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
that
prohibits
the
knowing
use
of
a
common
carrier
for
the
interstate
transportation
of
obscene
material.
we
believe
that
reidel
and
thirty-seven
photographs
have
effectively
settled
the
issues
raised
here.
indeed,
the
judge
who
decided
this
case
has
subsequently
sustained
the
constitutionality
of
this
section
after
those
cases
were
handed
down.
that
is
not
cited
in
our
briefs
and
the
citation
to
that
case
is
united
states
versus
zacher
332
f.
supp.
833.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
833,
yes
your
honor.
in
trying
to
evade
the
clear
import
of
reidel
and
thirty-seven
photographs,
appellee
makes
two
different
arguments.
one
is
that
even
when
transportation
is
for
the
purpose
of
sale,
congress
cannot
prohibit
the
use
of
common
carriers
to
transport
obscene
materials
interstate.
the
second
argument
assumes
that
commercial
transportation
maybe
forbidden,
but
contends
that
the
statute
is
invalid
as
it
applies
to
non-commercial
transportation
and
that
this
impermissible
overbreadth
renders
the
entire
section
invalid
on
its
face.
it
is
the
government's
position
that
the
statute
is
constitutional
in
both
its
commercial
and
non-commercial
applications.
if
however,
it
is
considered
unconstitutional
in
some
or
all
non-commercial
applications,
it
is
our
position
that
the
statute
should
not
be
declared
invalid
on
its
face,
but
limited
to
its
permissible
application.
i
turn
first
to
the
argument
that
even
transportation
for
sale
is
constitutionally
protected.
in
reidel,
as
court
refused
to
recognize
a
constitutional
right
to
distribute
or
sell
obscene
materials
and
reiterated
the
principle
of
roth
that
obscenity
and
its
distribution
are
outside
the
reach
of
the
first
amendment.
in
thirty-seven
photographs,
six
justices
squarely
held
that
importation
of
obscenity
for
commercial
distribution
is
not
constitutionally
protected.
appellee
concedes
that
the
first
amendment
would
not
protect
the
commercial
distributor
of
obscene
materials
who
wishes
to
import
such
materials
or
send
them
through
the
mails,
but
he
argues
that
the
same
commercial
distributor
who
wishes
to
transport
materials
in
interstate
commerce
is
constitutionally
protected.
congress'
plenary
power
to
prohibit
not
just
materials
from
flowing
in
interstate
commerce,
has
long
been
a
cornerstone
of
this
court's
interpretation
of
the
commerce
clause.
in
gibbons
versus
ogden,
the
court
said
that
congress'
power
over
commerce
among
the
states
is
vested,
“as
absolutely
as
it
would
be
in
a
single
government.”
and
in
the
lottery
cases
as
well
as
many
others,
it
has
sustained
absolute
prohibitions
against
items
of
commerce
judged
harmful.
in
hope
versus
united
states
which
is
cited
in
our
briefs,
where
the
court
sustained
the
white
slave
traffic
act,
the
court
assumed
the
constitutionality
of
these
provisions
and
used
those
as
a
premise
to
reach
the
result
in
that
case.
congress'
powers
over
commerce
are
of
course,
limited
by
the
first
amendment,
but
the
first
amendment
is
also
relevant
to
what
congress
can
preclude
from
the
mails
or
forbid
from
being
imported.
appellee
cites
a
number
of
cases
for
the
proposition
that
the
government
has
special
powers
over
mail
because
it
operates
the
postal
system.
but
in
this
first
amendment
context
at
least,
these
cases
have
no
authority
after
blount
versus
rizzi
and
lamont
versus
postmaster
general.
the
government
can
no
more
exclude
protected
materials
from
the
mail
on
the
basis
of
their
content,
but
it
can
exclude
them
from
commerce.
and
conversely
if
commercial
distribution
of
obscenity
through
the
mails
can
be
prohibited,
so
also
can
any
sort
of
transportation
in
interstate
commerce
for
commercial
purposes.
assuming
that
congress
may
validly
prohibit
the
use
of
common
carriers
traveling
interstate
for
the
commercial
distribution
of
obscene
materials,
the
order
of
the
district
court
in
this
case
should
be
reversed
either
if
transportation
for
personal
use
may
also
be
prohibited
or
if
invalidity
as
to
transportation
for
personal
use
does
not
require
striking
down
the
entire
section.
we
believe
the
statute
is
constitutional
in
it's
non-commercial
as
well
it's
the
commercial
applications.
but
i
consider
the
overbreadth
point
first
because
we
believe
it's
clearly
controlled
by
thirty-seven
photographs.
first,
i
would
like
to
clear
up
what
seems
to
be
an
issue
from
appellee's
brief,
but
is
not
really
an
issue.
we
do
contend
that
it
is
inappropriate
to
hold
this
section
invalid
on
its
face,
but
we
do
not
contend
that
appellee
lacks
standing
to
make
that
claim.
appellee
does
have
standing
to
make
the
claim
that
invalidity
in
some
applications
renders
the
section
invalid
for
all
applications,
whether
or
not
he
is
a
commercial
distributor.
if
on
the
other
hand,
as
we
contend,
invalidity
in
some
applications
would
not
render
the
statute
invalid
as
to
all
applications,
then
the
district
court
could
determine
in
subsequent
proceedings
in
this
case,
the
purpose
of
the
transportation
here.
in
neither
of
that
is
this
court
required
to
determine
appellee's
purpose
from
this
record,
so
that
really
is
not
an
issue
at
this
point
in
the
case.
in
thirty-seven
photographs,
the
same
six
justices
who
held
that
importation
for
commercial
purposes
could
be
prohibited,
also
held
that
the
district
court
in
that
case
was
wrong
to
strike
down
the
entire
section
in
its
application
to
commercial
importation
because
importation
for
personal
use
might
be
constitutionally
protected.
mr.
justice
white's
majority
in
plurality
opinion
said,
“the
proper
approach
was
not
to
invalidate
the
section
in
its
entirety,
but
to
construe
it
narrowly
and
hold
it
valid
in
its
application
to
luros”
and
justices
harlan
and
stewart
concurred
on
the
same
ground.
as
these
opinions
indicate,
a
holding
of
facial
invalidity
for
overbreadth
is
not
appropriate
when
a
statute
can
be
clearly
narrowed
to
constitutional
applications
in
a
way
that
will
eliminate
virtually
all
of
the
possible
chilling
effect
on
protected
communication.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
as
to
the
nature
of
these
materials.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
that
is
correct.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
that
is
right,
yes
sir.
as
far
as
the
overbreadth
point
is
concerned,
the
language
of
section
1462
involved
in
this
case
is
virtually
indistinguishable
from
the
language
of
section
1305
(a)
involved
in
thirty-seven
photographs.
section
1462
involved
here
forbids
the
use
of
common
carriers
to
transport
obscenity
interstate
without
respect
to
purpose,
just
as
section
1305
(a)
that
provided
forfeiture
for
importation
of
obscene
material
without
respect
to
purpose.
section
1462
dates
back
to
1897
and
it
is
the
primary
prohibition
against
interstate
transport
of
obscene
materials
in
the
federal
law.
it
is
clear
that
congress
would
prefer
this
section
sustained
in
its
valid
applications
rather
than
being
declared
invalid
on
its
face.
and
this
case
does
not
involve
the
kind
of
interrelated
set
of
administrative
provisions
such
as
were
present
in
blount
versus
rizzi
and
freedman
versus
maryland.
in
those
kinds
of
cases,
the
court
declines
to
rewrite
an
administrative
setup
that
defines
certain
provisions
constitutionally
invalid,
but
here
we
have
a
straightforward
criminal
statute
that
can
be
validly
applied
in
certain
applications
and
plainly
the
lower
court
erred
in
striking
down
the
entire
section
on
its
face.
we
believe
the
court
also
erred
in
quite
a
different
respect
by
deciding
that
interstate
transportation
of
obscenity
for
personal
use
could
not
constitutionally
be
proscribed.
we
now
get
back
to
territory
that's
been
covered
in
the
previous
argument
to
some
extent.
reidel
and
thirty-seven
photographs
made
clear
as
had
roth
that
obscenity
is
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment
and
congressional
power
to
decide
what
goods
may
cross
state
lines
extends
to
this
unprotected
material.
what
the
plurality
said
in
thirty-seven
photographs
with
respect
to
foreign
commerce,
a
passage
that
the
solicitor
general
read
to
you
in
his
argument,
“obscene
materials
may
be
removed
from
the
channels
of
commerce
even
though
intended
solely
for
private
use
is
equally
true
of
interstate
commerce.”
the
majority
opinion
in
stanley
versus
georgia
indicates
that
the
government
may
not
invade
a
person's
home
to
ascertain
if
he
possesses
forbidden
material.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
our
position
would
be
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
that,
that
could
be
forbidden.
this
section
covers
only
transportation
by
common
carrier
and
1465
would
be
the
relevant
federal
section
for
that,
i
think
that
in
terms
of
transportation
for
sale
or
distribution,
yes.
now
then
i
suppose
you
have
a
nice
statutory
question
as
to
whether
if
you
give
a
book
to
a
friend,
that's
distribution
or
not,
within
the
terms
of
the
statute?
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
that
is
clear
your
honor
that
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
stature
and
certainly
there
would
be
a
strong
statutory
argument
that,
that
would
not
be
distribution
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
for
somebody
who
didn't
start
in
the
district
of
columbia,
well,
i
would
think
that
is
not
distribution.
it
is
our
position
that
if
it
is
obscene
material
and
someone
used
a
common
carrier
to
give
the
material
to
the
library
of
congress
then
unless
you
read
in
a
statutory
exception
for
that
kind
of
thing
that
could
constitutionally
be
covered.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
yes,
yes
that's
right.
we
would
say
that
constitutionally
it
could
be
covered.
for
similar
reasons
that
we
think
that
if
there
was
a
town
that
which
there
maybe,
in
which
canada
and
united
states
would
split
the
border,
we
think
that
that
could
be
covered
as
well.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
did
you
find
it
mr.
justice
douglas?
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
yes,
certainly.
well,
it
is
our
content
that
stanley
versus
georgia
--
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
alright,
i
am
sorry
i
will
check
that
--
does
not
require
the
government
to
stand
aside
for
the
channels
of
commerce
are
employed
by
individuals
who
are
interested
in
constitutionally
unprotected
material.
moreover,
the
government
does
have
a
special
interest
in
the
use
of
common
carriers
which
are
open
to
the
general
public
and
closely
regulated
in
the
public
interest.
if
persons
choose
to
use
such
carriers,
they
must
do
so
in
ways
not
deemed
inconsistent
with
the
public
interest.
practically,
there
are
substantial
reasons
for
allowing
the
government
to
forbid
the
use
of
common
carriers
to
transport
obscenity
irrespective
of
purported
purpose,
reasons
that
we
do
not
believe
were
applicable
on
stanley.
each
state
legislature
has
the
power
to
set
it's
on
policy
with
respect
to
the
sale
and
purchase
of
obscene
material.
one
state
may
forbid
the
sale
of
all
constitutionally
unprotected
material.
another
may
permit
their
sale,
as
oregon
has
chosen
to
do.
if
the
federal
government
is
powerless
to
stop
transportation
across
the
state
lines
--
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
had
mis-transcribed
one
of
the
page
numbers
and
it's
332
f.
supp
883,
instead
of
833
as
i
have
said
before.
i
was
in
the
middle
of
the
argument
that
this
statute
is
constitutional
as
it
reaches
non-commercial
transportation
and
i
have
made
the
basic
argument
that
the
material
is
unprotected
and
therefore
congress
can
prohibit
its
passage
in
interstate
commerce
and
i
turn
to
some
of
the
practical
reasons
that
support
that
conclusion.
and
i
have
mentioned
that
state
legislatures
may
forbid
constitutionally
unprotected
material
from
being
sold,
but
that
other
states
may
permit
their
sales
such
as
oregon
has
chosen
to
do
and
that
if
the
federal
government
is
powerless
to
stop
transportation
across
the
state
lines,
citizens
of
a
state
that
forbids
the
purchase
of
pornography
can
circumvent
that
policy
of
that
state
by
buying
material
in
a
more
permissive
jurisdiction
and
bringing
it
back
to
their
own
state.
more
significant
perhaps
in
terms
of
actual
impact
on
prosecutions
is
the
fact
that
if
only
commercial
transportation
maybe
stopped,
it
may
sometimes
be
difficult
to
prove
a
commercial
motive
although
that
is
the
real
reason
for
the
transportation
and
i
remind
you
of
the
solicitor
general's
argument
about
the
difficulties
of
drawing
that
particular
line.
also,
in
this
situation,
a
holding
of
constitutional
protection
of
private
transportation
would
cast
a
jeopardy,
scores
of
convictions
under
1462
where
transportation
was
in
fact
for
commercial
purposes,
but
in
which
the
jury
determination
of
guilt
of
course,
did
not
require
a
finding
to
that
effect.
finally,
there
is
the
danger
that
materials
taken
by
common
carriers
will
be
seen
by
other
members
of
the
public
who
maybe
offended.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
i
am
informed
that
there
are
approximately
25
prosecutions
a
year
under
1462,
anything
in
that
range.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
yeah,
and
then
all
problems
about
collateral
attack
--
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
well,
except
that
the
court's
rule
is
now
about
mootness
or
rather
liberal
toward
people
that
have
been
convicted
of
crimes
and
their
ability
to
challenge
crimes
that
might
have
adverse
effects
in
some
future
proceedings.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
yeah,
even
though
they
are
out
of
prison.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
for
first
offenders,
there
is
maximum
of
ten
years
for
second
defender,
but
i
would
guess,
as
i
think
you
are
suggesting
that
the
usual
sentence
is
not
terribly
long.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
i
don't
know
about
the
average
sentences,
or
how
many
people
are
still
in
jail.
the
wisdom
of
trying
to
stop
transportation
for
private
use
may
be
argued
well
and
in
fact,
the
government
does
not
prosecute
those
whom
it
believes
are
transporting
for
personal
use.
but
it
is
our
contention
that
there
is
no
constitutional
bar
to
set
the
prosecution
because
section
1462
is
patently
constitutional
as
to
use
of
common
carriers
to
transport
obscenity
for
sale
and
both
because
its
coverage
of
transportation
for
personal
use
is
also
constitutional
and
because
the
proper
approach,
if
the
section
is
unconstitutional
in
some
applications
is
to
limit
the
section
rather
than
invalidate
it
on
its
face,
the
order
of
the
district
court
in
this
case
should
be
reversed
and
the
indictment
should
be
reinstated.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
only
a
few
very
brief
comments.
i
don't
think
this
issue
was
raised
by
this
case,
but
i
think
that
what
may
seem
to
be
the
troublesome
hypothetical
of
someone
who
carries
in
his
pocket
one
obscene
book,
there
is
i
think
a
question
as
to
whether
the
statute
that
covers
that
person.
the
language
in
the
statute
reported
in
the
1955
revision
i
believe
was
deposit
with
the
common
carrier
and
the
change
in
language
was
designed
to
extend
the
venue
of
provision
so
that
people
could
be
prosecuted
at
jurisdictions
which
they
travel
through
as
well
as
the
place
that
they
had
put
the
materials
on
the
carriers.
so
i
think
there
might
be
an
argument
that
use
of
a
common
carrier
doesn't
cover
that
situation.
i
don't
say
that;
that's
right,
and
we
don't
think
--
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
that
--
and
assuming
that
it's
in
another
state,
the
country
home,
that
is
clearly
covered
by
the
statute
and
we
think
that
the
statute
is
constitutional
in
that
application.
we
go
back
to
our
original
argument
on
that
point,
and
this
possible
distinction
i
am
suggesting,
we
don't
suggest
it
in
constitutional
intervention.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
well,
if
the
owner
of
a
common
--
i
mean
if
a
guy
drives
his
own
bus
whether
that's
still
a
common
carrier,
i
am
not
sure,
so
there
would
be
that
question
as
to
whether
it's
a
common
carrier
we
are
putting.
if
the
owner
of
the
railroad
gets
on
his
own
train,
then
that's
covered.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
if
that's
still
a
common
carrier,
yes,
he
has
and
i
think
it
would
be,
no.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
there
is
a
separate
provision
for
mail.
i
mean,
if
its'
set
by
--
that's
1461.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
oh
absolutely,
i
mean
reidel
makes
that
clear
i
should
think.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
oh
well,
yes
we
do
think
that
if
there
is
not
a
right
to
sell,
there
is
also
not
a
right
to
buy.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
we
think
that
prosecution
could
be
brought
against
the
purchaser.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
that
is
correct.
in
other
words,
if
you
set
off
a
book
company
asking
them
to
send
you
something,
and
it
was
sent
to
you,
we
don't
think
there
would
been
a
constitutional
bar
to
constitute
the
purchaser
as
well
the
seller.
on
the
severability
point,
i'd
like
to
suggest
the
language
of
united
states
versus
jackson
390
us
570,
in
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
stewart,
at
footnote
on
page
585,
he
says
--
the
court
said,
whatever
relevance
in
such
an
explicit
clause
may
have
in
creating
a
presumption
of
severability,
the
ultimate
determination
of
severability
will
rarely
turn
the
presence
or
absence
of
such
a
clause.
we
think
it's
clear
that
whatever
this
specific
language
of
the
severability
provision,
basically
the
question
is
trying
to
ascertain
congressional
intent
as
to
what
--the
remainder
of
the
statute
preserved
or
not.
finally,
as
to
the
legislative
history
that's
been
suggested
there
seems
to
me
the
major
defect
with
the
argument
as
has
been
made
is
that
the
conclusion
doesn't
follow
up
on
the
premise.
it
is
clearly
true
that
congress
does
mean
to
cover
non-commercial
transportation,
but
it
does
not
follow
from
that;
but
if
it
has
to
have
only
commercial
transportation
or
nothing
at
all,
that
it
would
choose
nothing
at
all
and
that
really
is
the
question
here
on
the
overbreadth
point.
i
might
mention
that
because
i
think
in
the
sense
this
supports
another
point
we
were
making
that
this
provision,
well
first
of
all,
the
original
1897
statute
did
not,
if
you
deposited
the
material
in
the
common
carrier,
there
was
no
requirement
of
wanting
to
sell
it
or
distribute
it,
it
was
only
the
person
who
took
the
material
from
the
common
carrier
that
had
the
limit
that
my
brother
has
mentioned.
so
that
is
relevant
to
receiver,
not
to
the
person
who
deposited
the
material.
secondly,
in
1909
when
this
change
was
made,
a
similar
change
was
made
as
to
section
1461
and
the
congressional
record
in
the
house
indicates
that
the
reason
that
the
change
was
made
was
because
it
was
very
difficult
to
prove
the
element
that
was
required
in
showing
the
purpose
of
a
person
who
was
receiving
the
material
from
the
common
carrier.
so
that
the
words
were
eliminated
to
eliminate
a
difficult
element
of
proof
and
i
think
that
supports
our
argument
that
to
draw
that
constitutional
distinction
does
create
a
difficult
element
of
proof
which
congress
has
not
wished
to
impose
and
which
is
not
required
by
any
of
this
court's
decision.
thank
you.
