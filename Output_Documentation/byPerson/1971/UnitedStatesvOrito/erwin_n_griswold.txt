mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
in
some
ways
like
the
one
just
argued
and
in
some
ways
different.
it
is
a
prosecution
under
section
1462
of
title
18
of
the
united
states
code
which
would
have
been
applicable
in
the
prior
case
because
it
makes
it
a
crime
to
bring
into
the
unites
states
obscene
material.
but
it
is
also
applicable
to
any
person
who
knowingly
uses
any
express
company
or
other
common
carrier
for
carriage
and
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
of
any
obscene,
lewd,
lascivious,
and
so
on
a
book
or
other
material.
this
case
started
with
an
indictment
which
appears
on
page
1
of
the
appendix
involving
a
charge
that
a
substantial
amount,
68
reels
of
8-millimeter
color
films,
216-millimeter
negatives,
315-millimeter
black
and
white
films,
and
a
number
of
other
items
were
cause
to
be
transported
and
carried
in
interstate
commerce
from
san
francisco
to
milwaukee
by
trans
world
airlines
and
north
central
airlines.
there
was
then
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
that
motion
appears
on
page
3.
this
case
has
been
thought
to
involve
the
same
question
as
the
previous
case
namely
whether
that
statute
can
constitutionally
apply
to
a
private
transportation,
but
i
would
like
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
that
question
is
not
really
here
and
that
the
question
which
is
here
is
one
which
was
decided
by
six
or
seven
members
of
the
court
in
thirty-seven
photographs.
for
the
motion
to
dismiss
on
page
3
comes
now
the
defendant
and
the
above
entitled
action
respectfully
moves
this
court
for
the
entry
of
an
order
dismissing
the
indictment
on
the
ground
at
section
1462
of
title
18
is
unconstitutional.
and
then
skipping
a
few
lines,
defendant
respectfully
asserts
that
regardless
of
whether
the
transportation
is
for
the
purpose
of
commercial
distribution
or
for
the
personal
possession
and
enjoyment
of
the
transporter,
this
statute
violates
rights
guaranteed
by
the
first
and
the
ninth
amendments.
and
then
at
the
bottom
of
page
6,
six
lines
from
the
bottom
have
having
dealt
previously
with
the
private
transportation.
on
the
other
hand,
should
the
statute
be
construed
to
impose
criminal
sanctions
only
upon
those
who
utilize
interstate
commerce
for
the
purpose
of
the
commercial
distribution
of
obscene
material,
then
the
statute
denies
to
the
defendant
the
right
to
sell
and
distribute
obscene
material
which
is
predicated
upon
the
correlative
right
of
an
intended
recipient
to
purchase
and
enjoy
this
material.
thus,
it
seems
to
me
quite
clear
that
this
case
involves
exactly
the
same
questions
as
those
in
thirty-seven
photographs
two
questions.
first,
is
the
statute
unconstitutional
because
it
might
apply
to
private
importation
and
the
court
in
thirty-seven
photographs
held
that
the
statute
should
not
be
so
construed
and
that
even
though
it
might
be
invalid
as
applied
to
private
importation
in
that
case,
that
it
would
be
valid
as
applied
to
commercial
importation.
the
result
of
the
decision
below
is
to
deprive
the
united
states
of
its
opportunity
to
prove
that
this
was
a
commercial
transportation
and
not
a
private
transportation.
if
it
was
a
commercial
transportation,
united
states
against
thirty-seven
photographs
is
clear
authority
for
the
constitutional
validity
of
the
statute.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
question
which
we
argued
in
the
last
case
is
there.
i
have
little
more
that
i
can
say
about
that.
all
i
am
saying
is
that
that
question
isn’t
here.
that
question
is
not
presented
by
this
record.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
this
judge
cut
down
the
statute
on
its
face
held
that
it
was
unconstitutional
entirely,
and
i
think
that
is
demonstrably
wrong
because
i
think
the
court
has
decided
that
it
is
constitutional
as
applied
to
a
commercial
transportation
in
thirty-seven
photographs,
and
i
think
that
the
court
had
decided
that
even
though
it
might
be
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
a
private
transportation,
that
is
not
a
sufficient
basis
for
holding
the
entire
statute
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
and
in
this
connection,
i
would
point
out
two
other
decisions.
the
very
district
judge
below
who
decided
this
case
has
subsequently
decided
in
effect
that
his
decision
was
wrong.
since
this
court
decided
thirty-seven
photographs,
he
has
sustained
a
prosecution
under
the
statute.
in
united
states
against
zacher,
332
f.
supp.
883,
now
there
was
confusion
at
the
earlier
argument
where
my
associate
mr.
greenawalt
said
833
and
the
case
could
not
be
found,
but
it
exists.
it
is
332
f.
supp.
883.
and
also
at
the
same
time
that
the
case
was
coming
through
the
wisconsin
court,
there
was
another
case
in
which
the
same
defendant,
george
joseph
orito
was
convicted
under
the
same
statute
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
central
district
of
california,
that
conviction
was
affirmed
it
being
a
commercial
dissemination
and
this
court
denied
certiorari
in
402
u.s.
987
almost
contemporaneously
with
the
decisions
in
reidel
and
thirty-seven
photographs.
and
so,
this
is
my
argument
in
this
case
that
the
question
involved
in
the
previous
case
200
reels
of
film
is
not
in
this
case.
it
is
not
properly
before
the
court
and
that
the
only
questions
to
which
are
in
this
case
have
already
been
squarely
decided
by
a
clear
majority
of
the
court
in
thirty-seven
photographs.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
as
i
have
already
indicated,
i
do
not
think
that
the
question
of
private
use
of
pornographic
or
obscene
materials
is
involve
in
this
case,
and
i
would
rather
hesitate
to
hazard
that,
shall
we
say
ultimate
issue
on
this
particular
case.
i
would
like
to
observe
however
that
even
at
best,
this
is
not
a
very
private
situation.
the
indictment
here
charges
the
shipping
of
a
substantial
quantity
of
material
by
air
express.
not
personal
luggage,
not
accompanying
the
traveler,
but
the
transportation
over
a
distance
of
some
2,000
miles
within
the
united
states.
if
that
is
personal,
then
the
underlying
foundation
of
stanley
which
i
take
it
to
be
thought
control
and
i
just
like
thought
control
but
it
can
be
a
kind
of
a
shibboleth
which
serves
to
stifle
further
the
thought.
if
that
is
private,
then
stanley
it
seems
to
me
has
little
or
no
limitation.
and
in
that
connection,
i
would
like
to
refer
to
another
case
which
was
once
before
this
court.
this
is
b
&
h
distributing
corporation.
united
states
against
b
&
h
distributing
corporation
which
was
where
an
indictment
was
dismissed
by
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
wisconsin,
judge
doyle
and
that
case
judge
gordon
here,
the
united
states
took
an
appeal
and
this
court
on
june
21,
1971
in
403
u.s.
927
vacated
the
judgment
and
the
remanded
it
for
consideration
for
reconsideration
in
the
light
of
this
court’s
decision
in
united
states
against
reidel
and
united
states
against
thirty-seven
photographs.
now
in
judge
doyle’s
first
opinion
in
that
case,
he
drew
the
distinction
between
private
and
public.
he
did
not
make
it
between
private
and
commercial,
but
he
drew
it
between
private
and
public
and
he
said
if
the
terms
are
employed,
then
public
uses
or
conduct
must
be
defined
as
those
which
are
in
conflict
with
the
goal
or
interest
of
protecting
children
from
exposure
to
obscenity
or
with
the
goal
or
interest
of
preventing
assaults
on
the
sensibilities
of
an
unwilling
adult
public,
private
uses
or
conduct
must
be
defined
as
those
which
are
not
so
in
conflict.
now,
that
you
see
extends
the
private
conception
to
everything
except
children
and
nonconsenting
adults.
that
seems
to
me
to
have
no
proper
foundation
and
the
concern
about
thought
control
which
underlies
stanley.
i
would
point
out
that
the
decision
that
commercial
distribution
may
be
made
criminal
has
a
thought
control
element
because
if
the
material
is
more
difficult
to
obtain
through
commercial
distribution,
it
becomes
harder
for
these
ideas
such
as
they
are
to
be
communicated
and
thought
about
by
individuals.
now,
this
b
&
h
case
went
back
to
the
western
district
of
wisconsin.
the
court
has
again
dismissed
the
indictment
relying
on
stanley
against
georgia,
and
i
have
authorized
the
taking
of
a
further
appeal
to
this
court
not
only
because
of
the
issue,
but
because
i
feel
a
considerable
obligation
to
lay
before
this
court
any
decision
in
which
a
court
holds
an
act
of
congress
to
be
unconstitutional.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
an
act
of
congress
is
unconstitutional,
it
ought
to
be
by
decision
of
this
court
with
full
respect
of
course
to
the
lower
courts
which
must
develop
the
cases
for
our
presentation
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
in
this
sense
mr.
justice
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no.
in
the
sense
that
it
is
private
unless
it
involves
children
or
nonconsenting
adults
which
i
think
sometimes
is
put
under
the
head
of
pandering.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
i
cannot
tell
you
mr.
justice,
but
we
do
not
concede
in
that
case
that
it
was
private.
what
i
am
using
the
case
to
illustrate
is
that
if
you
draw
that
line
between
private
and
commercial.
item
one,
it
is
afar
from
clear
line.
item
two,
like
so
many
ideas
which
i
have
a
tendency
to
expand
the
private
notion
is
already
expanding
in
lower
court
decisions
and
would
apparently
take
over
everything
except
pandering.
now,
i
look
at
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
you
may
be
right
mr.
justice.
it’s
--
sometimes
it’s
not
easy
to
separate
what’s
in
the
record
from
what
one
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
all
you
have
in
the
record
is
that
he
did
transport
by
means
of
a
common
carrier.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
that
is
because
the
statute
says
transport
and
carry,
i
believe.
i
would
suggest
that
it
is
quite
a
lot
of
itself
to
take
along
with
you
68
reels
of
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes.
i
agree
that
the
indictment
is
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
it
is
not,
it
is
not
clear
that
this
was
an
ordinary
shipment.
i
read
the
first
amendment
of
course
with
great
respect
and
indeed
gratitude.
i
have
been
in
places
where
there
is
nothing
like
the
first
amendment
and
i
know
the
feeling
that
can
be
gendered
and
people
who
are
subject
to
such
a
regime.
but
no
matter
how
much
i
read
it,
i
don’t
find
anything
in
it
about
commercial
or
private.
i
do
not
find
anything
in
it
about
children,
non
consenting
adults
or
pandering
to
the
extent
that
these
terms
have
come
in
to
the
discussion
of
these
problems.
they
are
obviously
used
to
define
or
describe
concepts
or
ideas
which
are
derived
out
of
the
first
amendment
in
some
way
or
another.
obviously,
the
first
amendment
cannot
be
limited
to
the
precise
words.
one
can
speak
by
raising
his
finger
or
by
shaking
his
head.
it
is
not
limited
to
actuation
of
the
vocal
cords.
on
the
other
hand,
there
is
very
real
room
to
question,
how
far
the
expansion
of
the
amendment
should
be
carried?
how
far
matters
of
this
sort
should
be
left
to
legislative
judgment
when
they
do
not
involve
any
direct
violation
of
anything
which
is
contained
in
the
amendment?
and
i
mentioned
these
ideas
about
children
and
nonconsenting
adult
in
private
and
commercial
to
show
how
far
the
conception
has
expanded.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
i
argued
that
in
the
previous
case.
i
don’t
think
that
the
distinction
between
private
and
commercial
can
find
any
support
on
the
amendment.
i
can
see
some
reasons
when
one
thing
is
in
term
to
thought
control,
but
i
do
not
find
anything
in
the
first
amendment
that
says
anything
about
thought
control.
if
one
thinks
in
terms
of
thought
control,
then
i
think
he
can
focus
in
on
the
man’s
library
in
his
own
home.
it
was
extraordinarily
unfortunate
that
those
georgia
officials
who
had
power
to
under
a
search
warrant
to
seize
gambling
equipment
took
it
upon
themselves
to
take
materials
out
of
the
man’s
private
library
and
thereby
create
a
case
which
came
to
this
court
and
i
have
great
sympathy
with
the
conclusion
which
was
reached
that
is
was
not
appropriate
for
them
to
prosecute
him
for
the
mere
possession
of
materials
in
his
own
library,
though
i
would
have
put
it
on
fourth
amendment
grounds
rather
than
on
first
amendment
grounds.
i
suggest
to
say
that
that
establishes
a
doctrine
that
the
first
amendment
prevents
thought
control.
and
therefore,
this
right
of
privacy
must
be
extended
to
a
man
no
matter
where
he
is,
no
matter
what
he
does
to
his
luggage,
to
his
importations
into
the
united
states
is
to
erect
a
very
large
structure
on
a
very
narrow
base.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes.
yes,
i
suppose
you
could
and
that
it
seems
to
me
might
conceivably
involve
a
question
under
the
fourth
amendment
which
allows
only
reasonable
searches
and
seizures,
and
a
search
for
printed
material,
a
man’s
diary
for
example
in
the
privacy
of
his
own
home
might
well
be
established
by
decisions
of
this
court.
boyd
case
comes
--
approaches
it
doesn’t
quite
get
there
long
ago
as
being
beyond
the
scope
of
a
reasonable
search
and
seizure.
thus,
if
this
case
does
involve
any
question
of
the
applicability
of
the
first
amendment
to
private
possession
of
obscene
material,
we
would
make
the
same
argument
here
that
we
made
in
the
previous
case
that
there
is
no
appropriate
basis
for
construing
the
first
or
shall
i
say
expanding
the
first
amendment
to
make
it
applicable
here,
and
that
the
decision
below
should
be
reversed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
we’re
fine.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
in
some
ways
like
the
one
just
argued
and
in
some
ways
different.
it
is
a
prosecution
under
section
1462
of
title
18
of
the
united
states
code
which
would
have
been
applicable
in
the
prior
case
because
it
makes
it
a
crime
to
bring
into
the
unites
states
obscene
material.
but
it
is
also
applicable
to
any
person
who
knowingly
uses
any
express
company
or
other
common
carrier
for
carriage
and
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
of
any
obscene,
lewd,
lascivious,
and
so
on
a
book
or
other
material.
this
case
started
with
an
indictment
which
appears
on
page
1
of
the
appendix
involving
a
charge
that
a
substantial
amount,
68
reels
of
8-millimeter
color
films,
216-millimeter
negatives,
315-millimeter
black
and
white
films,
and
a
number
of
other
items
were
cause
to
be
transported
and
carried
in
interstate
commerce
from
san
francisco
to
milwaukee
by
trans
world
airlines
and
north
central
airlines.
there
was
then
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
that
motion
appears
on
page
3.
this
case
has
been
thought
to
involve
the
same
question
as
the
previous
case
namely
whether
that
statute
can
constitutionally
apply
to
a
private
transportation,
but
i
would
like
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
that
question
is
not
really
here
and
that
the
question
which
is
here
is
one
which
was
decided
by
six
or
seven
members
of
the
court
in
thirty-seven
photographs.
for
the
motion
to
dismiss
on
page
3
comes
now
the
defendant
and
the
above
entitled
action
respectfully
moves
this
court
for
the
entry
of
an
order
dismissing
the
indictment
on
the
ground
at
section
1462
of
title
18
is
unconstitutional.
and
then
skipping
a
few
lines,
defendant
respectfully
asserts
that
regardless
of
whether
the
transportation
is
for
the
purpose
of
commercial
distribution
or
for
the
personal
possession
and
enjoyment
of
the
transporter,
this
statute
violates
rights
guaranteed
by
the
first
and
the
ninth
amendments.
and
then
at
the
bottom
of
page
6,
six
lines
from
the
bottom
have
having
dealt
previously
with
the
private
transportation.
on
the
other
hand,
should
the
statute
be
construed
to
impose
criminal
sanctions
only
upon
those
who
utilize
interstate
commerce
for
the
purpose
of
the
commercial
distribution
of
obscene
material,
then
the
statute
denies
to
the
defendant
the
right
to
sell
and
distribute
obscene
material
which
is
predicated
upon
the
correlative
right
of
an
intended
recipient
to
purchase
and
enjoy
this
material.
thus,
it
seems
to
me
quite
clear
that
this
case
involves
exactly
the
same
questions
as
those
in
thirty-seven
photographs
two
questions.
first,
is
the
statute
unconstitutional
because
it
might
apply
to
private
importation
and
the
court
in
thirty-seven
photographs
held
that
the
statute
should
not
be
so
construed
and
that
even
though
it
might
be
invalid
as
applied
to
private
importation
in
that
case,
that
it
would
be
valid
as
applied
to
commercial
importation.
the
result
of
the
decision
below
is
to
deprive
the
united
states
of
its
opportunity
to
prove
that
this
was
a
commercial
transportation
and
not
a
private
transportation.
if
it
was
a
commercial
transportation,
united
states
against
thirty-seven
photographs
is
clear
authority
for
the
constitutional
validity
of
the
statute.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
question
which
we
argued
in
the
last
case
is
there.
i
have
little
more
that
i
can
say
about
that.
all
i
am
saying
is
that
that
question
isn’t
here.
that
question
is
not
presented
by
this
record.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
this
judge
cut
down
the
statute
on
its
face
held
that
it
was
unconstitutional
entirely,
and
i
think
that
is
demonstrably
wrong
because
i
think
the
court
has
decided
that
it
is
constitutional
as
applied
to
a
commercial
transportation
in
thirty-seven
photographs,
and
i
think
that
the
court
had
decided
that
even
though
it
might
be
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
a
private
transportation,
that
is
not
a
sufficient
basis
for
holding
the
entire
statute
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
and
in
this
connection,
i
would
point
out
two
other
decisions.
the
very
district
judge
below
who
decided
this
case
has
subsequently
decided
in
effect
that
his
decision
was
wrong.
since
this
court
decided
thirty-seven
photographs,
he
has
sustained
a
prosecution
under
the
statute.
in
united
states
against
zacher,
332
f.
supp.
883,
now
there
was
confusion
at
the
earlier
argument
where
my
associate
mr.
greenawalt
said
833
and
the
case
could
not
be
found,
but
it
exists.
it
is
332
f.
supp.
883.
and
also
at
the
same
time
that
the
case
was
coming
through
the
wisconsin
court,
there
was
another
case
in
which
the
same
defendant,
george
joseph
orito
was
convicted
under
the
same
statute
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
central
district
of
california,
that
conviction
was
affirmed
it
being
a
commercial
dissemination
and
this
court
denied
certiorari
in
402
u.s.
987
almost
contemporaneously
with
the
decisions
in
reidel
and
thirty-seven
photographs.
and
so,
this
is
my
argument
in
this
case
that
the
question
involved
in
the
previous
case
200
reels
of
film
is
not
in
this
case.
it
is
not
properly
before
the
court
and
that
the
only
questions
to
which
are
in
this
case
have
already
been
squarely
decided
by
a
clear
majority
of
the
court
in
thirty-seven
photographs.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
as
i
have
already
indicated,
i
do
not
think
that
the
question
of
private
use
of
pornographic
or
obscene
materials
is
involve
in
this
case,
and
i
would
rather
hesitate
to
hazard
that,
shall
we
say
ultimate
issue
on
this
particular
case.
i
would
like
to
observe
however
that
even
at
best,
this
is
not
a
very
private
situation.
the
indictment
here
charges
the
shipping
of
a
substantial
quantity
of
material
by
air
express.
not
personal
luggage,
not
accompanying
the
traveler,
but
the
transportation
over
a
distance
of
some
2,000
miles
within
the
united
states.
if
that
is
personal,
then
the
underlying
foundation
of
stanley
which
i
take
it
to
be
thought
control
and
i
just
like
thought
control
but
it
can
be
a
kind
of
a
shibboleth
which
serves
to
stifle
further
the
thought.
if
that
is
private,
then
stanley
it
seems
to
me
has
little
or
no
limitation.
and
in
that
connection,
i
would
like
to
refer
to
another
case
which
was
once
before
this
court.
this
is
b
&
h
distributing
corporation.
united
states
against
b
&
h
distributing
corporation
which
was
where
an
indictment
was
dismissed
by
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
wisconsin,
judge
doyle
and
that
case
judge
gordon
here,
the
united
states
took
an
appeal
and
this
court
on
june
21,
1971
in
403
u.s.
927
vacated
the
judgment
and
the
remanded
it
for
consideration
for
reconsideration
in
the
light
of
this
court’s
decision
in
united
states
against
reidel
and
united
states
against
thirty-seven
photographs.
now
in
judge
doyle’s
first
opinion
in
that
case,
he
drew
the
distinction
between
private
and
public.
he
did
not
make
it
between
private
and
commercial,
but
he
drew
it
between
private
and
public
and
he
said
if
the
terms
are
employed,
then
public
uses
or
conduct
must
be
defined
as
those
which
are
in
conflict
with
the
goal
or
interest
of
protecting
children
from
exposure
to
obscenity
or
with
the
goal
or
interest
of
preventing
assaults
on
the
sensibilities
of
an
unwilling
adult
public,
private
uses
or
conduct
must
be
defined
as
those
which
are
not
so
in
conflict.
now,
that
you
see
extends
the
private
conception
to
everything
except
children
and
nonconsenting
adults.
that
seems
to
me
to
have
no
proper
foundation
and
the
concern
about
thought
control
which
underlies
stanley.
i
would
point
out
that
the
decision
that
commercial
distribution
may
be
made
criminal
has
a
thought
control
element
because
if
the
material
is
more
difficult
to
obtain
through
commercial
distribution,
it
becomes
harder
for
these
ideas
such
as
they
are
to
be
communicated
and
thought
about
by
individuals.
now,
this
b
&
h
case
went
back
to
the
western
district
of
wisconsin.
the
court
has
again
dismissed
the
indictment
relying
on
stanley
against
georgia,
and
i
have
authorized
the
taking
of
a
further
appeal
to
this
court
not
only
because
of
the
issue,
but
because
i
feel
a
considerable
obligation
to
lay
before
this
court
any
decision
in
which
a
court
holds
an
act
of
congress
to
be
unconstitutional.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
an
act
of
congress
is
unconstitutional,
it
ought
to
be
by
decision
of
this
court
with
full
respect
of
course
to
the
lower
courts
which
must
develop
the
cases
for
our
presentation
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
in
this
sense
mr.
justice
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no.
in
the
sense
that
it
is
private
unless
it
involves
children
or
nonconsenting
adults
which
i
think
sometimes
is
put
under
the
head
of
pandering.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
i
cannot
tell
you
mr.
justice,
but
we
do
not
concede
in
that
case
that
it
was
private.
what
i
am
using
the
case
to
illustrate
is
that
if
you
draw
that
line
between
private
and
commercial.
item
one,
it
is
afar
from
clear
line.
item
two,
like
so
many
ideas
which
i
have
a
tendency
to
expand
the
private
notion
is
already
expanding
in
lower
court
decisions
and
would
apparently
take
over
everything
except
pandering.
now,
i
look
at
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
you
may
be
right
mr.
justice.
it’s
--
sometimes
it’s
not
easy
to
separate
what’s
in
the
record
from
what
one
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
all
you
have
in
the
record
is
that
he
did
transport
by
means
of
a
common
carrier.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
that
is
because
the
statute
says
transport
and
carry,
i
believe.
i
would
suggest
that
it
is
quite
a
lot
of
itself
to
take
along
with
you
68
reels
of
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes.
i
agree
that
the
indictment
is
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
it
is
not,
it
is
not
clear
that
this
was
an
ordinary
shipment.
i
read
the
first
amendment
of
course
with
great
respect
and
indeed
gratitude.
i
have
been
in
places
where
there
is
nothing
like
the
first
amendment
and
i
know
the
feeling
that
can
be
gendered
and
people
who
are
subject
to
such
a
regime.
but
no
matter
how
much
i
read
it,
i
don’t
find
anything
in
it
about
commercial
or
private.
i
do
not
find
anything
in
it
about
children,
non
consenting
adults
or
pandering
to
the
extent
that
these
terms
have
come
in
to
the
discussion
of
these
problems.
they
are
obviously
used
to
define
or
describe
concepts
or
ideas
which
are
derived
out
of
the
first
amendment
in
some
way
or
another.
obviously,
the
first
amendment
cannot
be
limited
to
the
precise
words.
one
can
speak
by
raising
his
finger
or
by
shaking
his
head.
it
is
not
limited
to
actuation
of
the
vocal
cords.
on
the
other
hand,
there
is
very
real
room
to
question,
how
far
the
expansion
of
the
amendment
should
be
carried?
how
far
matters
of
this
sort
should
be
left
to
legislative
judgment
when
they
do
not
involve
any
direct
violation
of
anything
which
is
contained
in
the
amendment?
and
i
mentioned
these
ideas
about
children
and
nonconsenting
adult
in
private
and
commercial
to
show
how
far
the
conception
has
expanded.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
i
argued
that
in
the
previous
case.
i
don’t
think
that
the
distinction
between
private
and
commercial
can
find
any
support
on
the
amendment.
i
can
see
some
reasons
when
one
thing
is
in
term
to
thought
control,
but
i
do
not
find
anything
in
the
first
amendment
that
says
anything
about
thought
control.
if
one
thinks
in
terms
of
thought
control,
then
i
think
he
can
focus
in
on
the
man’s
library
in
his
own
home.
it
was
extraordinarily
unfortunate
that
those
georgia
officials
who
had
power
to
under
a
search
warrant
to
seize
gambling
equipment
took
it
upon
themselves
to
take
materials
out
of
the
man’s
private
library
and
thereby
create
a
case
which
came
to
this
court
and
i
have
great
sympathy
with
the
conclusion
which
was
reached
that
is
was
not
appropriate
for
them
to
prosecute
him
for
the
mere
possession
of
materials
in
his
own
library,
though
i
would
have
put
it
on
fourth
amendment
grounds
rather
than
on
first
amendment
grounds.
i
suggest
to
say
that
that
establishes
a
doctrine
that
the
first
amendment
prevents
thought
control.
and
therefore,
this
right
of
privacy
must
be
extended
to
a
man
no
matter
where
he
is,
no
matter
what
he
does
to
his
luggage,
to
his
importations
into
the
united
states
is
to
erect
a
very
large
structure
on
a
very
narrow
base.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes.
yes,
i
suppose
you
could
and
that
it
seems
to
me
might
conceivably
involve
a
question
under
the
fourth
amendment
which
allows
only
reasonable
searches
and
seizures,
and
a
search
for
printed
material,
a
man’s
diary
for
example
in
the
privacy
of
his
own
home
might
well
be
established
by
decisions
of
this
court.
boyd
case
comes
--
approaches
it
doesn’t
quite
get
there
long
ago
as
being
beyond
the
scope
of
a
reasonable
search
and
seizure.
thus,
if
this
case
does
involve
any
question
of
the
applicability
of
the
first
amendment
to
private
possession
of
obscene
material,
we
would
make
the
same
argument
here
that
we
made
in
the
previous
case
that
there
is
no
appropriate
basis
for
construing
the
first
or
shall
i
say
expanding
the
first
amendment
to
make
it
applicable
here,
and
that
the
decision
below
should
be
reversed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
we’re
fine.
