mr.
james
m.
shellow
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
friend
misconceives
the
thrust
of
our
argument.
we
do
not
seek
any
derivative
rights
under
stanley.
we
do
not
seek
any
correlative
rights
under
stanley.
the
appellee
in
this
case
is
charged
with
the
private
possessory
transportation
of
obscene
material.
we
assert
that
if
stanley
holds
any
meaning,
it
says
that
one
cannot
be
prosecuted
for
the
private
possession
of
obscene
material
and
that's
precisely
what's
charged
in
this
case.
the
private
possession
of
obscene
material
and
the
first
and
ninth
amendment
underpinnings
of
stanley
protect
the
man
who
is
carrying
the
obscene
or
pornographic
book
which
he
is
reading
on
an
airplane
just
as
it
would
protect
him
if
he
were
reading
it
in
his
home
provided
that
he
doesn't
read
it
in
such
a
way
that
he
exposes
it
to
persons
who
don't
want
to
see
it
or
who
would
be
offended
by
it.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
yes.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
yes,
if
he
had
500
pictures
in
his
luggage
on
an
airplane.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
well,
the
only
--
i
submit
that
the
only
inference
that
can
be
drawn
from
500
pictures
all
the
same,
if
he
is
going
to
go
into
the
business
and
do
something
with
these
pictures
and
if
this
court
wishes
to
draw
the
line
and
say
that
1462
applies
only
to
commercial
transportation,
then
i
should
think
it
would
be
a
fairly
easy
matter
of
proof
that
in
fact,
this
was
a
commercial
venture.
if
however
he
has
one
picture,
or
ten
pictures
and
he
has
them
in
his
pocket
on
the
airplane,
then
he
is
protected.
if
he
has
one
picture
or
ten
pictures
in
his
luggage
on
the
airplane,
i
submit
this
is
protected
under
the
direct
folding
of
stanley.
stanley
doesn't
have
to
be
extended.
stanley
was
not
actually
viewing
obscene
film
at
the
time
the
officers
arrived
with
a
search
warrant,
stanley
was
merely
possessing
them
with
the
intent
at
some
future
date
to
view
them,
just
as
the
man
on
the
airplane,
whether
in
his
pocket
or
in
his
luggage
is
possessing
the
material
with
an
intent
at
some
future
time
to
privately
enjoy
his
collection
of
erotica.
similarly
it's
no
extension
of
stanley
to
protect
the
possession
in
his
suitcase
on
the
airplane.
he
is
on
the
airplane,
the
suitcase
is
on
the
airplane,
this
is
as
protected
as
it
would
be,
as
if
it
were
in
stanley's
house
or
in
the
traveler's
pocket.
as
we
move
to
a
more
attenuated
examples,
i
think,
stanley
still
confers
direct
protection.
the
man
who
moves
from
a
residence
in
california
to
a
residence
in
wisconsin
and
shifts
by
common
carrier,
his
collection
of
pornography
where
he
is
the
shipper
and
the
consignee,
he
is
protected,
the
shipment
is
protected.
this
is
a
private
use
in
a
private
setting.
it's
as
protected
as
if
he
stayed
in
his
residence
in
california
and
the
man
who
takes
the
magazine
to
his
hunting
lodge
in
another
state
by
common
carrier.
each
of
these
are
examples
of
private
possessory
transportation.
the
key
isn't
the
possession.
there
is
no
distribution
of
it
and
we
submit
it
that
that's
precisely
the
interdiction
of
1462.
1462
permits
such
persons
to
be
prosecuted
and
flies
directly
in
the
mandate
of
family.
we
assert
that
to
the
extent
that
stanley
or
some
of
the
opinions
in
stanley
would,
we
found
these
two
opinions,
stanley
would
have
found
stanley's
right
on
a
fourth
amendment
claim
as
my
friend
has
asserted
that
it
might
be,
to
that
extent
our
interstate
traveler
is
protected
as
well.
in
katz
this
court
said
that
the
fourth
amendment
protects
people
not
places.
in
mancoosi
(ph)
this
court
said
that
the
fourth
amendment
protects
places
where
the
individual
has
a
reasonable
expectation
and
he
will
be
free
from
governmental
intrusion.
and
we
submit
that
each
of
these
considerations
applies
to
the
man
who
has
a
pornographic
picture
in
his
pocket,
the
film
in
his
luggage
as
he
travels
from
one
state
to
another.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
i
don't
think
so.
i
view
thirty-seven
photographs
not
only
as
pure
private
possessory
transportation,
but
as
a
case
in
which
mr.
luros
asked
the
affirmative
assistance
of
the
government
in
bringing
this
material
into
the
country,
and
perhaps
the
distinction
can
be
drawn
between
he
who
imports
privately
and
seeks
to
have
some
government
customs
agent
authorize
his
importation
than
the
man
who
seeks
nothing
from
the
government
and
merely
seeks
to
go
to
his
hunting
lodge
in
utah.
that
is
how
i
will
distinguish
it,
that
is
how
i
believe
it
doesn't
conflict
with
thirty-seven
photographs
with
the
plurality
opinion.
we
then
come
to
the
question,
can
this
court
narrowly
construe
section
1462
so
that
the
statute
and
the
ambit
of
the
statute
applies
only
to
commercial
--
to
the
distributive
process,
and
i
am
not
certain
whether
the
court
would
approach
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
commercial
aspects
or
the
distributive
aspects.
certainly,
one
wouldn't
be
prosecuted
who
brought
in
his
luggage
from
milwaukee
to
washington
the
exhibits
which
form
the
basis
of
his
argument
and
yet
that
is
of
course
within
the
ambit
of
1462
as
well.
we
start
i
think
in
looking
as
to
whether
or
not
this
court
can
construe
the
statute
narrowly
to
exclude
private
possessory
transportation
at
the
words
of
the
statute.
the
words
of
the
statute
clearly
do
not
have
any
reference
to
commercial
or
distributive
for
functions
unlike
section
1465.
we
look
to
the
words
of
the
statute
and
we
remember
the
recent
words
of
mr.
justice
stewart
in
camp
versus
sorana
(ph)
in
which
he
stated
the
principle
of
strict
construction
of
criminal
statutes
demands
that
some
determinant
limit
be
established
based
upon
the
actual
words
of
the
statute
and
there
are
no
determinant
limits
that
can
be
placed
upon
the
actual
words
of
this
statute.
this
statute
would
not
require
construction,
it
would
require
rewriting.
what
this
court
would
be
doing
would
be
adding
an
additional
element
to
the
offense
which
was
enacted
by
congress
in
section
1462
of
title
18.
the
distinctions
of
course
between
what
the
appellee
asserts
you
cannot
do
in
this
case
and
you
did
do
in
thirty-seven
photographs.
alright,
but
number
one,
thirty-seven
photographs
is
not
a
criminal
proceeding,
it's
a
civil
forfeiture
proceeding.
secondly,
you
don't
have
the
same
kind
of
severability
clause
to
work
with.
the
severability
clause
which
applies
to
title
19
permits
the
court
to
severe
out
unconstitutional
applications.
the
severability
clause
which
is
appended
to
title
18
as
we
recite
in
our
yellow
brief
does
not
permit
the
severing
out
of
unconstitutional
applications.
it's
a
different
kind
of
severability.
perhaps
more
important
is
the
matter
that
we
touched
on
tangentially
in
our
brief
and
now
i
would
like
to
elaborate
on
it
in
more
detail.
the
court
will
recall
that
in
its
opinion
in
blount
versus
rizzi,
the
issue
was
raised
as
to
whether
or
not
the
legislation
there
could
not
be
saved
by
a
construction
which
would
provide
for
judicial
review
and
this
court
noted
that
that
was
what
the
post
master
sought.
he
sought
to
avoid
precisely
that,
and
so
the
court
wasn't
free
to
impose
a
constitutional
meaning
on
the
section
there
involved.
in
this
case,
this
isn't
a
case
in
which
congress
in
section
1462
never
considered
the
commercial
applications
of
it.
when
this
statute
was
first
enacted
in
1897,
the
final
clause
which
prohibits
one
who
takes
from
a
common
carrier
obscene
material,
was
limited
to
commercial
distribution
and
it
was
in
that
statute
that
it
said
whoever
takes
from
a
common
carrier
with
the
intent
to
sell,
distribute,
or
circulate.
that
was
the
way
the
act
was
in
1897,
that
was
the
way
it
was
reenacted
in
1905,
and
when
it
went
into
the
1907,
1908,
1909
general
revision
of
the
penal
laws,
the
joint
committee,
the
joint
committee
of
the
senate
and
house
which
reported
it
out,
reported
it
out
changed
from
the
earlier
statute
in
two
material
respects.
the
first
respect,
the
committee
added
to
the
first
clause,
the
importation
clause
that
it
must
be
for
the
purpose
of
disposing
of
the
material.
that
importation
would
not
be
unlawful
unless
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
disposing,
and
retained
in
the
final
clause
this
with
intent
to
sell,
distribute,
or
circulate.
when
it
came
to
the
floor
and
was
reported
out
on
the
floor
of
the
house,
congressman
houston
amended
the
senate
proposal,
the
joint
proposal
by
striking
both
of
those
provisions
and
1462
for
practical
purposes
appears
now
at
least
as
far
as
this
aspect
is
concerned
as
it
was
amended
by
congressman
houston
of
tennessee.
but
congress
on
at
least
three
occasions
and
probably
four
if
you
consider
the
predecessor
bill
that
was
passed
by
the
senate
and
not
by
the
house,
on
four
occasions
has
addressed
itself
to
whether
this
statute
should
be
limited
to
commercial
activity
and
on
at
least
three
occasions,
and
it
said
no.
so
i
think
that
in
the
face
of
that
kind
of
legislative
history,
we
can't
distort
the
language
of
a
statute,
we
can't
add
an
additional
element
to
this
offense.
we
can't
indict
individuals
or
offenses
which
were
not
enacted
by
the
congress.
the
construction
which
would
narrow
1462
to
commercial
applications
would
pose
all
sorts
of
problems
of
truth.
as
the
solicitor
general
pointed
out
in
his
previous
argument,
as
my
friend
pointed
out
in
this
argument,
to
limit
the
construction
would
impose
an
unreasonable
burden
on
the
government
in
how
you
go
about
proving
that
it
was
for
commercial
purposes
and
will
the
self-proving
declarations
of
defendants
be
sufficient
to
defeat
a
prosecution
further,
should
this
court
then
enact
some
sort
of
presumption
as
appears
in
1465
to
make
proof
easier.
1465
is
of
interest
by
its
terms
would
apply
also
to
transportation
by
common
carriers.
the
legislative
history
of
1465
suggests
that
it
was
to
fill
the
loophole
and
to
permit
prosecution
of
private
carriers,
but
certainly
nothing
in
the
language
of
the
statute
is
that
restrictive.
so
would
this
court
then
enact
a
presumption
so
that
if
you
had
five
or
more
copies
of
a
magazine
or
two
copies
of
one
magazine
and
three
of
another,
then
this
is
presumptive
evidence
for
the
commercial
purpose.
also,
i
submit
that
the
statutes
which
are
enacted,
most
of
the
statutes,
which
are
enacted
which
prohibit
some
form
of
transportation
of
something
around
the
country
from
one
state
to
another.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
oh
certainly,
i
think
that
1465
if
they
don't
have
the
requisite
number
to
permit
the
instruction
on
the
presumption
then
i
think
the
jury
can
be
instructed,
you
may
consider,
although
you
do
not
need
to
the
number
of
magazines
possessed
by
this
defendant.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
it
poses
problems.
i
don't
know,
i
guess,
perhaps
that
was
a
little
straw,
but
for
example
in
the
post
leary
cases
that
without
the
presumption
of
unlawful
importation
and
knowledge
thereof,
the
prosecutions
have
been
few
and
far
between
and
i
would
submit
that
it's
a
difficult
proof,
it's
not
impossible.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
yes
sir.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
yes.
first,
it's
an
interesting
case.
the
indictment
in
zacher
is
identical
to
the
indictment
in
this
case,
that
is
that
both
zacher
and
orito
were
charged
with
the
same
transportation
at
the
same
time
and
the
same
place.
it
appears
they
were
both
on
the
same
airplane,
it's
difficult
to
determinate
whose
luggage
it
was,
that
appears
to
be
the
case.
as
far
as
judge
gordon's
opinion
is
concerned,
judge
gordon
misses
the
thrust
of
our
argument
and
to
be
perfectly
fair,
this
argument
was
never
made
to
judge
gordon,
this
concept
of
possessory
transportation,
it
wasn't
necessary.
it
wasn't
necessary
that
it'd
be
elaborated
in
the
detail
in
which
i
presented
to
you
for
it
was
not
necessary
that
he
thread
his
way
to
reidel
and
luros,
reidel
and
thirty-seven
photographs.
i
think
that
judge
gordon
misconceives
the
thrust
of
our
argument,
although
we
did
not
argue
zacher.
he
misconceives
the
thrust
of
in
it
that
we
are
not
asking
that
this
court
or
that
court
extend
stanley
one
iota.
zacher
and
orito
were
engaged
in
a
private
possessory
transportation,
and
stanley
protects
those
who
privately
possess.
neither
of
them
were
distributing,
no
inference
of
distributing
can
be
drawn.
their
activity
is
protected
by
the
first
and
ninth
amendments.
as
we
thread
our
way
through
reidel
and
thirty-seven
photographs,
we
note,
but
do
not
rely
upon
the
fact
that
those
who
ship
or
carry
on
common
carriers
in
interstate
commerce
obscene
material
do
not
seek
the
affirmative
intervention
of
our
government
for
their
enterprise,
for
their
private
enjoyment
of
obscenity.
it
maybe
that
the
government
and
this
court
can
hold
that
if
you
wish
to
enjoy
obscenity
in
the
privacy
of
your
home
or
the
privacy
of
your
railroad
car,
that's
alright,
but
don't
ask
us
to
help
you
with
it.
that
is
don't
seek
the
affirmative
assistance
of
the
government
in
permitting
you
to
enjoy
your
sordid
reading
habits.
i
submit
that
on
that
basis
some
distinction
can
be
drawn
between
reidel,
thirty-seven
photographs,
gable
versus
jenkins
which
in
a
sense
there
the
defendants
--
plaintiffs
in
that
case,
there
they
sought
the
two
acquired
derivative
rights.
they
sought
to
take
stanley
and
say
that
because
stanley
has
the
right
to
read,
we
have
the
right
to
sell
to
him,
because
stanley
has
the
right
to
possess,
we
have
the
right
to
deliver.
the
court
made
short
script
to
that
argument.
i
don't
think
that
the
opinion,
this
one
sentence
opinion
in
gable
versus
jenkins
poses
any
problems
to
us
for
we
do
not
seek
any
derivative
benefits.
we
place
ourselves
squarely
within
stanley,
we
claim
that
those
who
possess
obscene
material
as
long
as
they
possess
it
in
a
way
in
which
it
is
unlikely
that
it
will
be
exposed
to
unwilling
adults
or
exposed
to
children
or
placed
in
front
of
an
unwilling
public,
as
they
long
as
they
privately
possess
it
in
an
area
in
which
there
is
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy,
then
they
are
protected.
they
are
protected
by
the
ninth
amendment
and
by
the
first
amendment
and
to
the
extent
that
stanley
is
the
fourth
amendment
question
by
the
fourth
amendment
as
well.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
we
submit
that
if
stanley
had
100
or
200
copies
and
he
was
prosecuted
under
the
georgia
statute
that
makes
it
unlawful
to
possess
for
purposes
of
sale,
that
the
prosecution
could
not
have
been
blocked
by
the
stanley
opinion,
that
is
the
stanley
opinion
does
not
expend
to
those
who
possess
for
purposes
of
sale
and
it
more
than
extends
to
those
who
possess
for
purposes
of
distribution,
leaving
aside
for
the
moment
the
thorny
question
of
what
this
does
this
court
do
about
private
distribution.
the
issue
of,
may
i
send
my
obscene
book
by
common
carrier
to
the
library
of
congress,
may
i
bring
with
me
in
my
luggage
the
obscene
exhibits
before
i
argue
to
this
court.
leaving
aside
that
thorny
question
stanley
does
not
reach
the
commercial
distributor,
stanley
does
not
reach
the
one
who
has
not
yet
engaged
in
his
commercial
distribution,
but
is
possessing
repertory
to
that
distribution.
so
i
find
that
as
no
problem.
what
i
find
is
the
basic
problem
here
is
that
1462
extends
to
purely
private
possessory
transportation
and
the
statute
from
its
legislative
history,
from
the
words
that
are
used,
from
the
fact
that
it
was
amended
at
the
same
time,
that
1465
was
enacted
that
congress
was
perfectly
aware
of
the
problems
of
private
possessory
transportation.
that
the
statute
can't
be
construed
such
as
to
emasculate
the
clear
congressional
intent
that
it
was
intended
to
apply
to
what
this
court
has
held
to
be
protected.
i
submit
that
when
there
is
a
statute
in
which
the
intent
of
the
framers
clearly
and
unequivocally
demonstrate
that
the
statute
is
intended
to
impose
criminal
sanctions
upon
protected
conduct,
and
the
statute
cannot
be
permitted
to
stand.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
shellow,
mr.
greenawalt,
you
have
little
time
left.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
let
me
at
the
outset
correct
if
i
may,
a
few
impressions
that
may
have
been
left
with
this
court
by
the
solicitor.
the
opinion
of
judge
doyle
in
b
&
h
distributing
company
rendered
on
september
14,
1972
after
remand
by
this
court
held
only
one
thing
and
that
is
it
held
at
section
1462
is
overbroad.
it
did
not
have
anything
whatsoever
to
do
with
children.
it
had
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
nonconsenting
adults.
it
had
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
pandering.
it
merely
held
that
section
1462
as
enacted
can
be
applied
to
constitutionally
protected
activity,
and
for
this
reason
is
overbroad
and
it
is
therefore
void.
secondly,
incidentally
judge
doyle
in
that
opinion
assumed
for
the
purposes
of
that
opinion
that
the
defendants
in
that
case
where
engaged
in
the
commercial
distribution
of
obscenity,
and
he
assumed
that
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
among
other
things
that
a
large
number
of
magazines
where
involved
that
it
was
not
--
it
was
transportation
by
an
express
company
and
further
that
one
of
the
defendants
was
the
b
&
h
book
distributing
company
and
he
figured
that
it
was
a
reasonable
assumption
that
it
was
a
commercial
venture.
second
of
all,
the
zacher
case
which
has
been
alluded
to
by
the
solicitor
is
the
companion
case
to
orito.
zacher
and
orito
while
charged
in
different
indictments
where
charged
with
the
same
transportation.
and
so,
the
record
in
zacher
flashes
out
the
facts
that
are
of
course
absent
here
for
we
are
here
on
an
indictment
and
its
dismissal
only.
and
in
that,
in
the
hearings
in
zacher,
it
is
quite
clear
that
mr.
justice
stewart’s
inference
is
quite
correct.
and
that
is
that
the
luggage
was
with
him.
this
was
personal
hand
luggage
carried
by
it
on
an
airplane
in
the
cargo
compartment.
so,
with
those
two
matters
out
of
the
way,
i
can
address
what
i
conceived
to
be
as
the
logic
of
our
position.
we
approach
the
court
and
ask
the
court
to
look
at
stanley
and
if
stanley
means
anything,
it
means
that
in
our
society
today,
a
person
can
read
what
he
wants,
can
look
at
what
he
wants,
can
enjoy
the
kind
of
material
he
wants
to
enjoy
regardless
of
whether
it
has
social
value
or
not,
that
the
private
consumption
of
ideas
is
beyond
the
criminal
sanctions
of
the
federal
government
and
beyond
the
criminal
sanctions
of
any
state
including
georgia.
the
question
then
arises,
does
it
really
make
any
difference
whether
i
am
reading
the
obscene
magazine
in
my
home
or
whether
i
am
reading
it
on
an
airplane,
or
whether
i
am
taking
it
from
my
home
to
my
summer
home
on
an
airplane
or
in
a
train
and
we
asserted
clearly
does
not.
that
the
statute
by
its
terms
explicitly
applies
to
the
kind
of
reading
to
which
i
have
referred.
it
referred
to
persons
who
carry
obscene
material
by
common
carrier.
there
is
no
exception,
there
is
no
exclusion.
the
statute
as
it
is
written
is
overbroad
and
i
think
the
question
is
what
do
we
now?
i
think
in
its
last
argument
and
the
last
time
we
are
here
and
again
today,
the
solicitor
suggests
that
what
you
do
is
you
give
the
statute
a
limiting
construction,
and
you
limit
this
construction
to
apply
only
to
transportation
in
aid
of
or
in
furtherance
of
some
commercial
venture
or
distributive
process.
without
arguing,
what
the
merits
of
such
a
statute
would
be
and
i
have
serious
questions
whether
such
a
statute
would
be
constitutional.
it
certainly
would
be
a
better
statute
than
the
one
we
have.
and
the
question
then
is,
can
this
court
do
it?
can
such
a
limiting
construction
be
placed
on
section
1462
so
that
the
statute
instead
of
reading
transports
in
interstate
commerce
by
common
carrier
would
read
transports
with
intent
to
sell
or
distribute.
that’s
what
would
have
to
be
done
to
the
statute
and
i
submit
you
can’t
do
it
and
you
can’t
do
it
for
several
reasons.
the
first
reason
you
can’t
do
it
is
that
congress
did
it
and
did
it
at
1894
and
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute
shows
that
in
1894,
in
1896,
in
1897
and
all
the
way
up
to
1909,
this
statute
included
the
words
with
intent
to
sell.
in
1909,
there
was
a
general
revision
of
the
penal
code,
and
in
the
general
revision
of
the
penal
code,
the
issue
came
up,
whether
or
not
we
should
include
in
the
statute
the
phrase
that
had
been
there
for
15
years,
that
is
should
we
include
in
the
statute
“for
intent
to
sell
or
distribute?”
and
the
congressional
history
and
the
comments
of
those
who
addressed
themselves
to
this
bill
in
the
revision
in
1909
and
1910
shall
quite
clearly
that
it
was
the
intent
of
those
who
change
the
statute
to
make
the
statute
now
encompass
personal
possession,
non-commercial
possession,
non-distributive
possession,
and
why?
assembling
congressman
shurley
said,
we
want
to
do
it
so
that
it
is
consistent
with
section
1461.
it
wasn’t
1461
then,
it
was
a
different
number.
i
think
perhaps
212.
he
said
we
want
to
do
it
so
it
is
consistent
with
the
comstock
act.
the
comstock
act
does
not
have
any
exemption,
doesn’t
exclude
personal
distribution
by
the
mails.
therefore,
we
don’t
want
this
one
to
do
it,
sort
of
an
abstract
symmetry;
that’s
one.
secondly,
it
was
pointed
out
that
if
this
only
covered
persons
who
transport
with
intent
to
sell,
it
would
be
impossible
to
enforce
that
nobody
could
ever
prove
up
a
case
under
the
statute
that
we
have
to
have
a
statute
that
covers
both
personal
and
commercial
transportation,
or
will
never
get
any
convictions.
the
statute
was
changed
in
1909.
the
intent
to
sell
was
dropped
out.
we
have
essentially
today
with
some
changes,
albeit
but
not
in
pertinent
part
the
statute
that
was
adopted
in
1909.
and
perhaps
the
argument
could
be
made
well.
congress
did
not
know
of
the
kind
of
reasoning
that
would
come
up
in
stanley.
the
statute
was
tapered
with
again
last
year.
certainly,
congress
knew
stanley,
it
has
been
decided
by
last
year
and
last
year
when
congress
withdrew
from
the
reach
of
the
statute,
persons
who
shipped
material
advising
others
to
use
contraceptive
devices
certainly
could
have
tinkered
with
the
statute
in
this
area
as
well.
it
is
not
as
though
the
statute’s
never
been
fussed
with.
the
statute
was
changed
in
1920
to
include
motion
pictures.
it
was
a
changed,
i
guess
i
say
again
last
year,
to
exclude
contraceptive
devices.
so,
the
legislative
history
is
squarely
against
any
rewriting
of
this
statute.
in
order
to
rewrite
the
statute,
you
would
have
to
rewrite
it
back
the
way
it
was
in
1894
and
1897,
and
essentially,
you
have
to
be
telling
congressman
vilas,
congressman
shurley,
and
congressman
houston
that
you
didn’t
mean
what
you
said,
and
really
the
statute
as
you
originally
enacted,
it
should
be
permitted
to
stand.
and
i
submit
that’s
legislation,
that’s
not
adjudication.
secondly,
the
second
reason
that
you
can’t
draft
the
statute
is
because
one
limiting
construction
won’t
save
it.
shall
we
have
a
statute
that
we
are
going
to
draft
which
will
prohibit
us
was
suggested
in
our
last
argument
some
months
ago,
my
delivering
by
interstate
carrier,
my
library
of
obscenity
to
the
library
of
congress.
shall
we
have
a
statute
that
excludes
gifts?
shall
we
have
a
statute
at
which
we
will
write
in
a
presumption
such
as
is
written
in
the
1465
so
that
those
in
the
attorney
general’s
office
and
the
department
of
justice
have
a
chance
of
winning
a
prosecution
under
it?
1465
needs
a
presumption
because
without
the
presumption,
nobody
would
ever
get
a
conviction.
must
you
also
then
write
a
presumption
into
1462?
yet,
still
another
problem.
what
shall
you
do
if
you
are
going
to
rewrite
the
statute
for
congress?
if
you
are
going
to
rewrite
the
statute
for
us
all
about
those
jurisdictions
in
which
it
is
now
lawful
for
adults
to
buy/sell,
possess
and
transport
admittedly
obscene
material?
i
know
that
oregon
is
such
a
state
now.
i
am
advised
that
hawaii
has
recently
enacted
similar
legislation.
shall
you
draft
into
the
statute
as
has
been
drafted
into
number
of
other
federal
statutes,
exemptions
to
exempt
those
who
ship
this
material
and
the
jurisdictions
in
which
it
is
not
contraband?
i
submit
this
is
not
such
a
statute
that
you
can
rewrite
it.
you
are
not
dealing
with
the
procedural
problems
of
luros.
you
are
dealing
with
the
whole
fabric
of
the
statute
as
you
were
in
blount
versus
rizzi.
the
statute
must
go
back
to
congress.
it
cannot
--
it
cannot
i
submit
be
given
a
limiting
construction
by
this
court
consonant
with
any
of
the
principles
which
you
have
previously
expressed
concerning
limiting
statutes
and
interpreting
congressional
enactments.
the
--
this
is
not
a
question
where
you
can
sever
out
an
offending
word
from
a
statute.
there
are
no
offending
words.
what
you
must
do
is
you
must
take
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
and
add
clauses
to
it.
now
in
luros,
you
have
a
severability
statute
that
permitted
you
to
sever
out
certain
applications,
and
perhaps
you
could
do
so.
you
do
not
have
the
same
severability
statute
in
title
18.
now,
regardless
of
how
you
see
the
roots
of
stanley,
i
think
it’s
possible
perhaps
to
see
stanley
having
its
roots
as
a
first
amendment
problem,
as
a
first
amendment
right.
the
right
perhaps
to
read,
the
right
to
acquire
ideas,
perhaps
it’s
a
fourth
amendment
right
and
kind
of
a
strange
sense
that
the
home
gives
the
whole
problems
of
stanley
and
added
dimension.
perhaps
also
it’s
a
ninth
amendment
right,
just
the
right
to
be
let
alone,
the
right
to
read
and
enjoy
what
you
like.
and
if
stanley
has
fourth
amendment,
fourth
amendment
dimensions,
so
orito
also
has
added
dimensions.
although
orito
is
on
an
airplane
with
his
luggage,
and
mancusi
and
katz
tell
us
that
where
one
has
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy,
the
fourth
amendment
gives
him
such
privacy.
other
cases
speak
to
the
same
issue,
if
you
look
at
edwards
versus
california,
long
time
ago
back
in
1941,
and
more
recently
dunn
versus
blumstein,
and
still
more
recently
i
think
shapiro
versus
thompson.
we
have
another
right.
somehow
mr.
orito
has
a
right
to
travel
within
the
continental
united
states
and
no
one
can
place
a
burden
on
that
right.
i
don’t
know
that
this
court
has
ever
set
forth
clearly
what
the
roots
of
the
right
--
of
that
right
are.
but
somewhere,
somewhere
in
the
fabric
of
our
constitution
is
mr.
orito’s
right
to
go
from
washington
to
milwaukee.
and
if
he
can
go
from
washington
to
milwaukee,
if
he
can
go
one
place
to
another,
then
he
can
go
carrying
something
as
long
it
is
not
contraband.
as
long
as
it’s
not
goods
made
with
convict
made
labor,
as
long
as
it’s
not
goods
made
with
children,
as
long
as
it’s
not
contaminated
fruit,
what
mr.
orito
can
read
in
the
privacy
of
his
home
in
milwaukee,
wisconsin,
he
can
carry
with
him
to
california.
for
he
has
the
right
to
read
and
the
right
to
travel,
and
the
two
of
them
come
together
in
much
the
same
way
as
stanley
has
right
to
read
and
his
right
to
be
let
alone
in
his
own
home,
sort
of
come
together
--
mr.
james
m.
shellow
and
--
what
we
do
is
we
look
to
overbreadth.
perhaps
mr.
orito
is
transporting
this
material
in
his
luggage
for
as
a
commercial
venture.
nonetheless,
he
has
standing
to
raise
the
overbreadth
of
the
statute
as
you
recently
said
in
gooding
v.
wilson.
he
raises
the
application
even
if
you
infer
from
this
that
it’s
a
commercial
venture.
he
has
the
right
to
raise
those
whose
transportation
is
purely
personal.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
it
seems
--
mr.
james
m.
shellow
no.
all
right,
let
us,
if
you
wish.
i
am
not
prepared
to
assume
in
we
did
not
stipulate
as
reidel
did
and
as
luros
did.
we
stipulate
no
commercial
venture.
we
look
to
the
indictment
and
say
the
statute
is
overbroad.
but
even,
even
this
is
a
commercial
venture,
he
has
the
right
to
assert
the
overbreadth
of
the
statute
for
it
would
apply
to
noncommercial
transportation,
so
said
this
court
in
gooding
most
recently.
orito
was
search
to
stand.
he
comes
before
the
court
and
says
this
statute
is
no
good
and
you
can’t
construe
it
so
that
it
is
any
good.
and
that
is
why
it
doesn’t
make
any
difference.
if
in
this
case
mr.
orito
has
one
copy
of
one
dirty
magazine,
10
copies
of
films
or
150
copies,
incidentally,
there
is
nothing
in
this
indictment
which
tells
us
the
films
are
the
same.
that
is
we
don’t
know
there
copies,
i
don’t
think,
but
let
us
--
i
am
willing
to
infer
it.
i
don’t
think
it’s
central
to
my
argument
and
i
don’t
think
it’s
central
to
mr.
orito’s
right.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
i
read
united
states
v.
ross
in
which
this
court
held
you
cannot
pile
one
inference
upon
another.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
not
roth,
ross
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
fine.
let
us
assume
i’ll
concede
that
for
you
if
you
want
to
you
where
the
purpose
of
this
argument
alone
that
they
are
the
same.
must
we
conclude
from
the
fact
that
they
are
the
same
that
he
is
in
the
business?
i’ll
even
give
you
that
inference.
and
yet,
he
has
the
right
to
assume
that
this
prosecution
would
lie
if
he
had
one
deck
of
playing
cards
in
his
pocket
on
that
airplane.
you
cannot
restrict
mr.
orito’s
right
under
a
statute
which
would
restrict
my
right
to
bring
exhibits
to
this
court.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
there
is
no
stipulation
in
this
case
that
it
was
for
commercial
ventures.
if
you
wish
to
draw
the
inference
and
feel
the
inference
is
not
so
attenuated
that
it
can
be
drawn
--
mr.
james
m.
shellow
i
have
no
admissions
from
the
united
states
government
in
this
case
whatsoever,
and
we
have
no
concessions
by
the
defendant
either.
we
stand
before
the
court
and
say
the
statute
is
no
good.
it
can’t
be
applied
to
mr.
orito,
and
it
can’t
be
applied
to
mr.
zacher,
and
it
can’t
be
applied
to
me
if
i
happen
to
have
the
exhibits
in
this
case
one
copy
of
them
as
i
go
back
on
the
plane
to
milwaukee.
that
is
not
an
indictable
offense
and
it
can’t
be
made
an
indictable
offense,
and
for
carrying
exhibits
to
this
court,
i
can’t
go
to
the
penitentiary
for
five
years,
and
you
got
to
figure
out
someway
of
making
the
statute
say
that
and
you
can’t
do
it
because
the
legislative
history
is
against
you.
you
throw
the
statute
out
and
give
it
back
to
congress
and
say
give
us
a
statute
that
comports
with
the
first
amendment,
the
fourth
amendment,
the
ninth
and
maybe
the
fourteenth,
and
maybe
the
right
to
travel,
maybe
somewhere
woven
in
there
is
the
right
that
--
let
me
suggest
to
you
that
maybe
--
maybe
the
way
to
distinguish
a
way
reidel
and
luros,
and
i’m
not
awfully
happy
with
this
distinction.
but
maybe
the
way
to
distinguish
it
is
--
if
you
are
transporting
on
a
common
carrier
obscene
material,
you
seek
no
one’s
aid
but
the
common
carrier
whereas
mr.
reidel
sought
the
aid
of
the
united
states
government
in
purveying
his
stock
as
did
mr.
luros
seek
the
affirmative
assistance
of
our
customs
agency.
those
who
are
prosecuted
under
1462
seek
no
one’s
help.
we
do
not
seek
to
make
the
government
a
partner
in
this
enterprise.
we
just
seek
to
be
left
alone
and
maybe
that’s
the
distinction.
the
historic
interest
that
this
government
is
taking
unto
to
this
court
has
taken.
in
the
mails,
in
the
customs,
we
have
different
rules.
a
reading
of
a
border’s
search
problem
convinces
anyone,
do
you
know,
that
customs
problems
are
sui
generis,
even
in
the
criminal
field.
and
yet,
i
submit
to
you
that’s
a
distinction
that’s
so
viable
one
perhaps
in
this
area
of
obscenity
for
luros
was
a
custom’s
case
and
he
sought
the
government’s
help
as
reidel
sought
it
to
use
the
mails.
i
suggest
one
further
problem
the
if
the
statute
is
rewritten
by
this
court
to
add
the
phrase
that
was
deleted
in
1909
and
to
take
us
back
to
the
statute
that
was
enacted
in
1894,
that
would
we
then
not
to
be
confronted
with
a
statute
that
had
no
determinable
limits.
how
can
i
advise
anyone
at
to
what
are
the
elements
of
a
crime
if
all
that’s
necessary
is
the
intent?
i
suggest
to
you
that
you
said
in
the
campos-serrano,
not
too
long
ago
that
the
principal
restrict
them
structure
criminal
statute
demands
that
some
determinable
limits
be
established
based
upon
the
actual
words
of
the
statute.
that’s
what
mr.
justice
stewart
said.
the
actual
words
of
the
statute
don’t
place
determinable
limits
on
it.
the
actual
words
of
the
statute
make
me
criminally
liable
for
taking
these
exhibits
to
milwaukee.
actual
words
of
the
statute
actually
conform
to
what
congress
wanted
to
enact.
congress
wanted
to
enact
the
statute
that
covered
the
transportation
of
material
by
private
persons
not
for
gain,
not
for
hire,
not
for
distribution,
and
congress
enacted
such
a
law
and
the
law
is
unconstitutional,
and
we
can’t
save
it
as
much
as
we
would
like
to.
i
submit
that
the
language
that
appears
in
thirty-seven
photographs
where
the
blount
case
is
discussed
is
apposite,
where
the
court
said
that
in
blount
and
i
submit
as
in
orito,
you
are
dealing
with
the
federal
statute
and
you
have
a
power
to
give
in
an
authoritative
construction.
however,
in
this
case
as
in
blount
salvation
of
the
statute
would
have
require
to
complete
rewriting
of
it,
in
a
manner
inconsistent
with
the
expressed
intentions
of
some
of
its
authors.
the
language
was
from
blount,
but
the
application
is
crystal
clear
to
orito.
there
is
absolutely
no
way
of
escaping
the
fact
that
a
rewriting
of
the
statute
flies
in
the
face
of
what
its
authors
wanted,
of
what
they
explicitly
said
they
wanted,
and
in
that
case
--
in
this
case,
even
more
so
they
have
the
statute
that
should
have
to
rewrite
and
repealed
it
or
amended
it.
so,
i
suggest
that
we
seek
not
an
extension
really
of
stanley.
stanley
does
not
say
much
more,
i
don’t
think
that
an
individual
has
a
right
to
read
what
he
likes,
where
he
likes.
stanley
wanted
to
read
it
in
his
home,
perhaps
i
want
to
read
it
on
an
airplane.
as
long
as
i
do
not
show
it
kids
and
don’t
poke
the
person
next
to
me
and
say,
hey
look
at
my
magazine.
i
think
i
have
the
right
to
read
it.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
my
right
to
read,
my
right
to
read
on
an
airplane.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
i
think
just
as
i
have
a
right
to
be
left
alone,
so
perhaps
to
everyone
else.
and
somehow,
my
right
to
read
that
which
may
offend
others
does
not
extend
to
my
right
to
offend
them.
and
perhaps
this
court
can’t
enact
or
this
court
cannot
adjudicate
good
manners,
and
maybe
that’s
all
i
am
saying.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
of
course.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
of
course.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
i
think
--
i
think
that
--
mr.
james
m.
shellow
i
certainly
think
so.
i
think
that
the
--
i
don’t
know
the
[voice
overlap].
mr.
james
m.
shellow
the
right
not
to
be
exposed
to
loud
speakers
in
a
bus
perhaps.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
i
understand.
that’s
why
i
suggested
to
that
there
maybe
nothing
more
nor
less
than
good
manner.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
no.
i
suggest
that
the
individual’s
right
to
--
maybe
the
individual
who
rides
next
to
me
and
the
zone
of
privacy
which
surrounds
him
and
his
expectation
of
privacy,
maybe
that
imposes
upon
me
under
the
constitution,
a
correlative
obligation
not
to
invade
it.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
i
don’t
know,
i
can’t,
maybe
it’s
first
amendment,
maybe
it’s
ninth
--
mr.
james
m.
shellow
i
think
so.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
i
will
buy
that
and
i
think
that
--
thank
you.
that
is
way
i
look
at
it.[laughter]
mr.
james
m.
shellow
unless
the
government
takes
some
action
or
unless
congress
enacts
a
statute
that
says
that
he
who
thrust
obscene
material
upon
his
neighbor
on
an
airplane
shall
be
subject
to
five
years
imprisonment
and
a
fine
of
$10,000
then
maybe
that
statute
would
be
constitutional.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
short
of
congressional
action,
its
good
manners;
with
congressional
action,
it
maybe
constitutional.
under
neither
circumstance,
this
1462
withstand
analysis.
thank
you.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
friend
misconceives
the
thrust
of
our
argument.
we
do
not
seek
any
derivative
rights
under
stanley.
we
do
not
seek
any
correlative
rights
under
stanley.
the
appellee
in
this
case
is
charged
with
the
private
possessory
transportation
of
obscene
material.
we
assert
that
if
stanley
holds
any
meaning,
it
says
that
one
cannot
be
prosecuted
for
the
private
possession
of
obscene
material
and
that's
precisely
what's
charged
in
this
case.
the
private
possession
of
obscene
material
and
the
first
and
ninth
amendment
underpinnings
of
stanley
protect
the
man
who
is
carrying
the
obscene
or
pornographic
book
which
he
is
reading
on
an
airplane
just
as
it
would
protect
him
if
he
were
reading
it
in
his
home
provided
that
he
doesn't
read
it
in
such
a
way
that
he
exposes
it
to
persons
who
don't
want
to
see
it
or
who
would
be
offended
by
it.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
yes.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
yes,
if
he
had
500
pictures
in
his
luggage
on
an
airplane.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
well,
the
only
--
i
submit
that
the
only
inference
that
can
be
drawn
from
500
pictures
all
the
same,
if
he
is
going
to
go
into
the
business
and
do
something
with
these
pictures
and
if
this
court
wishes
to
draw
the
line
and
say
that
1462
applies
only
to
commercial
transportation,
then
i
should
think
it
would
be
a
fairly
easy
matter
of
proof
that
in
fact,
this
was
a
commercial
venture.
if
however
he
has
one
picture,
or
ten
pictures
and
he
has
them
in
his
pocket
on
the
airplane,
then
he
is
protected.
if
he
has
one
picture
or
ten
pictures
in
his
luggage
on
the
airplane,
i
submit
this
is
protected
under
the
direct
folding
of
stanley.
stanley
doesn't
have
to
be
extended.
stanley
was
not
actually
viewing
obscene
film
at
the
time
the
officers
arrived
with
a
search
warrant,
stanley
was
merely
possessing
them
with
the
intent
at
some
future
date
to
view
them,
just
as
the
man
on
the
airplane,
whether
in
his
pocket
or
in
his
luggage
is
possessing
the
material
with
an
intent
at
some
future
time
to
privately
enjoy
his
collection
of
erotica.
similarly
it's
no
extension
of
stanley
to
protect
the
possession
in
his
suitcase
on
the
airplane.
he
is
on
the
airplane,
the
suitcase
is
on
the
airplane,
this
is
as
protected
as
it
would
be,
as
if
it
were
in
stanley's
house
or
in
the
traveler's
pocket.
as
we
move
to
a
more
attenuated
examples,
i
think,
stanley
still
confers
direct
protection.
the
man
who
moves
from
a
residence
in
california
to
a
residence
in
wisconsin
and
shifts
by
common
carrier,
his
collection
of
pornography
where
he
is
the
shipper
and
the
consignee,
he
is
protected,
the
shipment
is
protected.
this
is
a
private
use
in
a
private
setting.
it's
as
protected
as
if
he
stayed
in
his
residence
in
california
and
the
man
who
takes
the
magazine
to
his
hunting
lodge
in
another
state
by
common
carrier.
each
of
these
are
examples
of
private
possessory
transportation.
the
key
isn't
the
possession.
there
is
no
distribution
of
it
and
we
submit
it
that
that's
precisely
the
interdiction
of
1462.
1462
permits
such
persons
to
be
prosecuted
and
flies
directly
in
the
mandate
of
family.
we
assert
that
to
the
extent
that
stanley
or
some
of
the
opinions
in
stanley
would,
we
found
these
two
opinions,
stanley
would
have
found
stanley's
right
on
a
fourth
amendment
claim
as
my
friend
has
asserted
that
it
might
be,
to
that
extent
our
interstate
traveler
is
protected
as
well.
in
katz
this
court
said
that
the
fourth
amendment
protects
people
not
places.
in
mancoosi
(ph)
this
court
said
that
the
fourth
amendment
protects
places
where
the
individual
has
a
reasonable
expectation
and
he
will
be
free
from
governmental
intrusion.
and
we
submit
that
each
of
these
considerations
applies
to
the
man
who
has
a
pornographic
picture
in
his
pocket,
the
film
in
his
luggage
as
he
travels
from
one
state
to
another.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
i
don't
think
so.
i
view
thirty-seven
photographs
not
only
as
pure
private
possessory
transportation,
but
as
a
case
in
which
mr.
luros
asked
the
affirmative
assistance
of
the
government
in
bringing
this
material
into
the
country,
and
perhaps
the
distinction
can
be
drawn
between
he
who
imports
privately
and
seeks
to
have
some
government
customs
agent
authorize
his
importation
than
the
man
who
seeks
nothing
from
the
government
and
merely
seeks
to
go
to
his
hunting
lodge
in
utah.
that
is
how
i
will
distinguish
it,
that
is
how
i
believe
it
doesn't
conflict
with
thirty-seven
photographs
with
the
plurality
opinion.
we
then
come
to
the
question,
can
this
court
narrowly
construe
section
1462
so
that
the
statute
and
the
ambit
of
the
statute
applies
only
to
commercial
--
to
the
distributive
process,
and
i
am
not
certain
whether
the
court
would
approach
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
commercial
aspects
or
the
distributive
aspects.
certainly,
one
wouldn't
be
prosecuted
who
brought
in
his
luggage
from
milwaukee
to
washington
the
exhibits
which
form
the
basis
of
his
argument
and
yet
that
is
of
course
within
the
ambit
of
1462
as
well.
we
start
i
think
in
looking
as
to
whether
or
not
this
court
can
construe
the
statute
narrowly
to
exclude
private
possessory
transportation
at
the
words
of
the
statute.
the
words
of
the
statute
clearly
do
not
have
any
reference
to
commercial
or
distributive
for
functions
unlike
section
1465.
we
look
to
the
words
of
the
statute
and
we
remember
the
recent
words
of
mr.
justice
stewart
in
camp
versus
sorana
(ph)
in
which
he
stated
the
principle
of
strict
construction
of
criminal
statutes
demands
that
some
determinant
limit
be
established
based
upon
the
actual
words
of
the
statute
and
there
are
no
determinant
limits
that
can
be
placed
upon
the
actual
words
of
this
statute.
this
statute
would
not
require
construction,
it
would
require
rewriting.
what
this
court
would
be
doing
would
be
adding
an
additional
element
to
the
offense
which
was
enacted
by
congress
in
section
1462
of
title
18.
the
distinctions
of
course
between
what
the
appellee
asserts
you
cannot
do
in
this
case
and
you
did
do
in
thirty-seven
photographs.
alright,
but
number
one,
thirty-seven
photographs
is
not
a
criminal
proceeding,
it's
a
civil
forfeiture
proceeding.
secondly,
you
don't
have
the
same
kind
of
severability
clause
to
work
with.
the
severability
clause
which
applies
to
title
19
permits
the
court
to
severe
out
unconstitutional
applications.
the
severability
clause
which
is
appended
to
title
18
as
we
recite
in
our
yellow
brief
does
not
permit
the
severing
out
of
unconstitutional
applications.
it's
a
different
kind
of
severability.
perhaps
more
important
is
the
matter
that
we
touched
on
tangentially
in
our
brief
and
now
i
would
like
to
elaborate
on
it
in
more
detail.
the
court
will
recall
that
in
its
opinion
in
blount
versus
rizzi,
the
issue
was
raised
as
to
whether
or
not
the
legislation
there
could
not
be
saved
by
a
construction
which
would
provide
for
judicial
review
and
this
court
noted
that
that
was
what
the
post
master
sought.
he
sought
to
avoid
precisely
that,
and
so
the
court
wasn't
free
to
impose
a
constitutional
meaning
on
the
section
there
involved.
in
this
case,
this
isn't
a
case
in
which
congress
in
section
1462
never
considered
the
commercial
applications
of
it.
when
this
statute
was
first
enacted
in
1897,
the
final
clause
which
prohibits
one
who
takes
from
a
common
carrier
obscene
material,
was
limited
to
commercial
distribution
and
it
was
in
that
statute
that
it
said
whoever
takes
from
a
common
carrier
with
the
intent
to
sell,
distribute,
or
circulate.
that
was
the
way
the
act
was
in
1897,
that
was
the
way
it
was
reenacted
in
1905,
and
when
it
went
into
the
1907,
1908,
1909
general
revision
of
the
penal
laws,
the
joint
committee,
the
joint
committee
of
the
senate
and
house
which
reported
it
out,
reported
it
out
changed
from
the
earlier
statute
in
two
material
respects.
the
first
respect,
the
committee
added
to
the
first
clause,
the
importation
clause
that
it
must
be
for
the
purpose
of
disposing
of
the
material.
that
importation
would
not
be
unlawful
unless
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
disposing,
and
retained
in
the
final
clause
this
with
intent
to
sell,
distribute,
or
circulate.
when
it
came
to
the
floor
and
was
reported
out
on
the
floor
of
the
house,
congressman
houston
amended
the
senate
proposal,
the
joint
proposal
by
striking
both
of
those
provisions
and
1462
for
practical
purposes
appears
now
at
least
as
far
as
this
aspect
is
concerned
as
it
was
amended
by
congressman
houston
of
tennessee.
but
congress
on
at
least
three
occasions
and
probably
four
if
you
consider
the
predecessor
bill
that
was
passed
by
the
senate
and
not
by
the
house,
on
four
occasions
has
addressed
itself
to
whether
this
statute
should
be
limited
to
commercial
activity
and
on
at
least
three
occasions,
and
it
said
no.
so
i
think
that
in
the
face
of
that
kind
of
legislative
history,
we
can't
distort
the
language
of
a
statute,
we
can't
add
an
additional
element
to
this
offense.
we
can't
indict
individuals
or
offenses
which
were
not
enacted
by
the
congress.
the
construction
which
would
narrow
1462
to
commercial
applications
would
pose
all
sorts
of
problems
of
truth.
as
the
solicitor
general
pointed
out
in
his
previous
argument,
as
my
friend
pointed
out
in
this
argument,
to
limit
the
construction
would
impose
an
unreasonable
burden
on
the
government
in
how
you
go
about
proving
that
it
was
for
commercial
purposes
and
will
the
self-proving
declarations
of
defendants
be
sufficient
to
defeat
a
prosecution
further,
should
this
court
then
enact
some
sort
of
presumption
as
appears
in
1465
to
make
proof
easier.
1465
is
of
interest
by
its
terms
would
apply
also
to
transportation
by
common
carriers.
the
legislative
history
of
1465
suggests
that
it
was
to
fill
the
loophole
and
to
permit
prosecution
of
private
carriers,
but
certainly
nothing
in
the
language
of
the
statute
is
that
restrictive.
so
would
this
court
then
enact
a
presumption
so
that
if
you
had
five
or
more
copies
of
a
magazine
or
two
copies
of
one
magazine
and
three
of
another,
then
this
is
presumptive
evidence
for
the
commercial
purpose.
also,
i
submit
that
the
statutes
which
are
enacted,
most
of
the
statutes,
which
are
enacted
which
prohibit
some
form
of
transportation
of
something
around
the
country
from
one
state
to
another.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
oh
certainly,
i
think
that
1465
if
they
don't
have
the
requisite
number
to
permit
the
instruction
on
the
presumption
then
i
think
the
jury
can
be
instructed,
you
may
consider,
although
you
do
not
need
to
the
number
of
magazines
possessed
by
this
defendant.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
it
poses
problems.
i
don't
know,
i
guess,
perhaps
that
was
a
little
straw,
but
for
example
in
the
post
leary
cases
that
without
the
presumption
of
unlawful
importation
and
knowledge
thereof,
the
prosecutions
have
been
few
and
far
between
and
i
would
submit
that
it's
a
difficult
proof,
it's
not
impossible.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
yes
sir.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
yes.
first,
it's
an
interesting
case.
the
indictment
in
zacher
is
identical
to
the
indictment
in
this
case,
that
is
that
both
zacher
and
orito
were
charged
with
the
same
transportation
at
the
same
time
and
the
same
place.
it
appears
they
were
both
on
the
same
airplane,
it's
difficult
to
determinate
whose
luggage
it
was,
that
appears
to
be
the
case.
as
far
as
judge
gordon's
opinion
is
concerned,
judge
gordon
misses
the
thrust
of
our
argument
and
to
be
perfectly
fair,
this
argument
was
never
made
to
judge
gordon,
this
concept
of
possessory
transportation,
it
wasn't
necessary.
it
wasn't
necessary
that
it'd
be
elaborated
in
the
detail
in
which
i
presented
to
you
for
it
was
not
necessary
that
he
thread
his
way
to
reidel
and
luros,
reidel
and
thirty-seven
photographs.
i
think
that
judge
gordon
misconceives
the
thrust
of
our
argument,
although
we
did
not
argue
zacher.
he
misconceives
the
thrust
of
in
it
that
we
are
not
asking
that
this
court
or
that
court
extend
stanley
one
iota.
zacher
and
orito
were
engaged
in
a
private
possessory
transportation,
and
stanley
protects
those
who
privately
possess.
neither
of
them
were
distributing,
no
inference
of
distributing
can
be
drawn.
their
activity
is
protected
by
the
first
and
ninth
amendments.
as
we
thread
our
way
through
reidel
and
thirty-seven
photographs,
we
note,
but
do
not
rely
upon
the
fact
that
those
who
ship
or
carry
on
common
carriers
in
interstate
commerce
obscene
material
do
not
seek
the
affirmative
intervention
of
our
government
for
their
enterprise,
for
their
private
enjoyment
of
obscenity.
it
maybe
that
the
government
and
this
court
can
hold
that
if
you
wish
to
enjoy
obscenity
in
the
privacy
of
your
home
or
the
privacy
of
your
railroad
car,
that's
alright,
but
don't
ask
us
to
help
you
with
it.
that
is
don't
seek
the
affirmative
assistance
of
the
government
in
permitting
you
to
enjoy
your
sordid
reading
habits.
i
submit
that
on
that
basis
some
distinction
can
be
drawn
between
reidel,
thirty-seven
photographs,
gable
versus
jenkins
which
in
a
sense
there
the
defendants
--
plaintiffs
in
that
case,
there
they
sought
the
two
acquired
derivative
rights.
they
sought
to
take
stanley
and
say
that
because
stanley
has
the
right
to
read,
we
have
the
right
to
sell
to
him,
because
stanley
has
the
right
to
possess,
we
have
the
right
to
deliver.
the
court
made
short
script
to
that
argument.
i
don't
think
that
the
opinion,
this
one
sentence
opinion
in
gable
versus
jenkins
poses
any
problems
to
us
for
we
do
not
seek
any
derivative
benefits.
we
place
ourselves
squarely
within
stanley,
we
claim
that
those
who
possess
obscene
material
as
long
as
they
possess
it
in
a
way
in
which
it
is
unlikely
that
it
will
be
exposed
to
unwilling
adults
or
exposed
to
children
or
placed
in
front
of
an
unwilling
public,
as
they
long
as
they
privately
possess
it
in
an
area
in
which
there
is
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy,
then
they
are
protected.
they
are
protected
by
the
ninth
amendment
and
by
the
first
amendment
and
to
the
extent
that
stanley
is
the
fourth
amendment
question
by
the
fourth
amendment
as
well.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
we
submit
that
if
stanley
had
100
or
200
copies
and
he
was
prosecuted
under
the
georgia
statute
that
makes
it
unlawful
to
possess
for
purposes
of
sale,
that
the
prosecution
could
not
have
been
blocked
by
the
stanley
opinion,
that
is
the
stanley
opinion
does
not
expend
to
those
who
possess
for
purposes
of
sale
and
it
more
than
extends
to
those
who
possess
for
purposes
of
distribution,
leaving
aside
for
the
moment
the
thorny
question
of
what
this
does
this
court
do
about
private
distribution.
the
issue
of,
may
i
send
my
obscene
book
by
common
carrier
to
the
library
of
congress,
may
i
bring
with
me
in
my
luggage
the
obscene
exhibits
before
i
argue
to
this
court.
leaving
aside
that
thorny
question
stanley
does
not
reach
the
commercial
distributor,
stanley
does
not
reach
the
one
who
has
not
yet
engaged
in
his
commercial
distribution,
but
is
possessing
repertory
to
that
distribution.
so
i
find
that
as
no
problem.
what
i
find
is
the
basic
problem
here
is
that
1462
extends
to
purely
private
possessory
transportation
and
the
statute
from
its
legislative
history,
from
the
words
that
are
used,
from
the
fact
that
it
was
amended
at
the
same
time,
that
1465
was
enacted
that
congress
was
perfectly
aware
of
the
problems
of
private
possessory
transportation.
that
the
statute
can't
be
construed
such
as
to
emasculate
the
clear
congressional
intent
that
it
was
intended
to
apply
to
what
this
court
has
held
to
be
protected.
i
submit
that
when
there
is
a
statute
in
which
the
intent
of
the
framers
clearly
and
unequivocally
demonstrate
that
the
statute
is
intended
to
impose
criminal
sanctions
upon
protected
conduct,
and
the
statute
cannot
be
permitted
to
stand.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
shellow,
mr.
greenawalt,
you
have
little
time
left.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
let
me
at
the
outset
correct
if
i
may,
a
few
impressions
that
may
have
been
left
with
this
court
by
the
solicitor.
the
opinion
of
judge
doyle
in
b
&
h
distributing
company
rendered
on
september
14,
1972
after
remand
by
this
court
held
only
one
thing
and
that
is
it
held
at
section
1462
is
overbroad.
it
did
not
have
anything
whatsoever
to
do
with
children.
it
had
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
nonconsenting
adults.
it
had
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
pandering.
it
merely
held
that
section
1462
as
enacted
can
be
applied
to
constitutionally
protected
activity,
and
for
this
reason
is
overbroad
and
it
is
therefore
void.
secondly,
incidentally
judge
doyle
in
that
opinion
assumed
for
the
purposes
of
that
opinion
that
the
defendants
in
that
case
where
engaged
in
the
commercial
distribution
of
obscenity,
and
he
assumed
that
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
among
other
things
that
a
large
number
of
magazines
where
involved
that
it
was
not
--
it
was
transportation
by
an
express
company
and
further
that
one
of
the
defendants
was
the
b
&
h
book
distributing
company
and
he
figured
that
it
was
a
reasonable
assumption
that
it
was
a
commercial
venture.
second
of
all,
the
zacher
case
which
has
been
alluded
to
by
the
solicitor
is
the
companion
case
to
orito.
zacher
and
orito
while
charged
in
different
indictments
where
charged
with
the
same
transportation.
and
so,
the
record
in
zacher
flashes
out
the
facts
that
are
of
course
absent
here
for
we
are
here
on
an
indictment
and
its
dismissal
only.
and
in
that,
in
the
hearings
in
zacher,
it
is
quite
clear
that
mr.
justice
stewart’s
inference
is
quite
correct.
and
that
is
that
the
luggage
was
with
him.
this
was
personal
hand
luggage
carried
by
it
on
an
airplane
in
the
cargo
compartment.
so,
with
those
two
matters
out
of
the
way,
i
can
address
what
i
conceived
to
be
as
the
logic
of
our
position.
we
approach
the
court
and
ask
the
court
to
look
at
stanley
and
if
stanley
means
anything,
it
means
that
in
our
society
today,
a
person
can
read
what
he
wants,
can
look
at
what
he
wants,
can
enjoy
the
kind
of
material
he
wants
to
enjoy
regardless
of
whether
it
has
social
value
or
not,
that
the
private
consumption
of
ideas
is
beyond
the
criminal
sanctions
of
the
federal
government
and
beyond
the
criminal
sanctions
of
any
state
including
georgia.
the
question
then
arises,
does
it
really
make
any
difference
whether
i
am
reading
the
obscene
magazine
in
my
home
or
whether
i
am
reading
it
on
an
airplane,
or
whether
i
am
taking
it
from
my
home
to
my
summer
home
on
an
airplane
or
in
a
train
and
we
asserted
clearly
does
not.
that
the
statute
by
its
terms
explicitly
applies
to
the
kind
of
reading
to
which
i
have
referred.
it
referred
to
persons
who
carry
obscene
material
by
common
carrier.
there
is
no
exception,
there
is
no
exclusion.
the
statute
as
it
is
written
is
overbroad
and
i
think
the
question
is
what
do
we
now?
i
think
in
its
last
argument
and
the
last
time
we
are
here
and
again
today,
the
solicitor
suggests
that
what
you
do
is
you
give
the
statute
a
limiting
construction,
and
you
limit
this
construction
to
apply
only
to
transportation
in
aid
of
or
in
furtherance
of
some
commercial
venture
or
distributive
process.
without
arguing,
what
the
merits
of
such
a
statute
would
be
and
i
have
serious
questions
whether
such
a
statute
would
be
constitutional.
it
certainly
would
be
a
better
statute
than
the
one
we
have.
and
the
question
then
is,
can
this
court
do
it?
can
such
a
limiting
construction
be
placed
on
section
1462
so
that
the
statute
instead
of
reading
transports
in
interstate
commerce
by
common
carrier
would
read
transports
with
intent
to
sell
or
distribute.
that’s
what
would
have
to
be
done
to
the
statute
and
i
submit
you
can’t
do
it
and
you
can’t
do
it
for
several
reasons.
the
first
reason
you
can’t
do
it
is
that
congress
did
it
and
did
it
at
1894
and
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute
shows
that
in
1894,
in
1896,
in
1897
and
all
the
way
up
to
1909,
this
statute
included
the
words
with
intent
to
sell.
in
1909,
there
was
a
general
revision
of
the
penal
code,
and
in
the
general
revision
of
the
penal
code,
the
issue
came
up,
whether
or
not
we
should
include
in
the
statute
the
phrase
that
had
been
there
for
15
years,
that
is
should
we
include
in
the
statute
“for
intent
to
sell
or
distribute?”
and
the
congressional
history
and
the
comments
of
those
who
addressed
themselves
to
this
bill
in
the
revision
in
1909
and
1910
shall
quite
clearly
that
it
was
the
intent
of
those
who
change
the
statute
to
make
the
statute
now
encompass
personal
possession,
non-commercial
possession,
non-distributive
possession,
and
why?
assembling
congressman
shurley
said,
we
want
to
do
it
so
that
it
is
consistent
with
section
1461.
it
wasn’t
1461
then,
it
was
a
different
number.
i
think
perhaps
212.
he
said
we
want
to
do
it
so
it
is
consistent
with
the
comstock
act.
the
comstock
act
does
not
have
any
exemption,
doesn’t
exclude
personal
distribution
by
the
mails.
therefore,
we
don’t
want
this
one
to
do
it,
sort
of
an
abstract
symmetry;
that’s
one.
secondly,
it
was
pointed
out
that
if
this
only
covered
persons
who
transport
with
intent
to
sell,
it
would
be
impossible
to
enforce
that
nobody
could
ever
prove
up
a
case
under
the
statute
that
we
have
to
have
a
statute
that
covers
both
personal
and
commercial
transportation,
or
will
never
get
any
convictions.
the
statute
was
changed
in
1909.
the
intent
to
sell
was
dropped
out.
we
have
essentially
today
with
some
changes,
albeit
but
not
in
pertinent
part
the
statute
that
was
adopted
in
1909.
and
perhaps
the
argument
could
be
made
well.
congress
did
not
know
of
the
kind
of
reasoning
that
would
come
up
in
stanley.
the
statute
was
tapered
with
again
last
year.
certainly,
congress
knew
stanley,
it
has
been
decided
by
last
year
and
last
year
when
congress
withdrew
from
the
reach
of
the
statute,
persons
who
shipped
material
advising
others
to
use
contraceptive
devices
certainly
could
have
tinkered
with
the
statute
in
this
area
as
well.
it
is
not
as
though
the
statute’s
never
been
fussed
with.
the
statute
was
changed
in
1920
to
include
motion
pictures.
it
was
a
changed,
i
guess
i
say
again
last
year,
to
exclude
contraceptive
devices.
so,
the
legislative
history
is
squarely
against
any
rewriting
of
this
statute.
in
order
to
rewrite
the
statute,
you
would
have
to
rewrite
it
back
the
way
it
was
in
1894
and
1897,
and
essentially,
you
have
to
be
telling
congressman
vilas,
congressman
shurley,
and
congressman
houston
that
you
didn’t
mean
what
you
said,
and
really
the
statute
as
you
originally
enacted,
it
should
be
permitted
to
stand.
and
i
submit
that’s
legislation,
that’s
not
adjudication.
secondly,
the
second
reason
that
you
can’t
draft
the
statute
is
because
one
limiting
construction
won’t
save
it.
shall
we
have
a
statute
that
we
are
going
to
draft
which
will
prohibit
us
was
suggested
in
our
last
argument
some
months
ago,
my
delivering
by
interstate
carrier,
my
library
of
obscenity
to
the
library
of
congress.
shall
we
have
a
statute
that
excludes
gifts?
shall
we
have
a
statute
at
which
we
will
write
in
a
presumption
such
as
is
written
in
the
1465
so
that
those
in
the
attorney
general’s
office
and
the
department
of
justice
have
a
chance
of
winning
a
prosecution
under
it?
1465
needs
a
presumption
because
without
the
presumption,
nobody
would
ever
get
a
conviction.
must
you
also
then
write
a
presumption
into
1462?
yet,
still
another
problem.
what
shall
you
do
if
you
are
going
to
rewrite
the
statute
for
congress?
if
you
are
going
to
rewrite
the
statute
for
us
all
about
those
jurisdictions
in
which
it
is
now
lawful
for
adults
to
buy/sell,
possess
and
transport
admittedly
obscene
material?
i
know
that
oregon
is
such
a
state
now.
i
am
advised
that
hawaii
has
recently
enacted
similar
legislation.
shall
you
draft
into
the
statute
as
has
been
drafted
into
number
of
other
federal
statutes,
exemptions
to
exempt
those
who
ship
this
material
and
the
jurisdictions
in
which
it
is
not
contraband?
i
submit
this
is
not
such
a
statute
that
you
can
rewrite
it.
you
are
not
dealing
with
the
procedural
problems
of
luros.
you
are
dealing
with
the
whole
fabric
of
the
statute
as
you
were
in
blount
versus
rizzi.
the
statute
must
go
back
to
congress.
it
cannot
--
it
cannot
i
submit
be
given
a
limiting
construction
by
this
court
consonant
with
any
of
the
principles
which
you
have
previously
expressed
concerning
limiting
statutes
and
interpreting
congressional
enactments.
the
--
this
is
not
a
question
where
you
can
sever
out
an
offending
word
from
a
statute.
there
are
no
offending
words.
what
you
must
do
is
you
must
take
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
and
add
clauses
to
it.
now
in
luros,
you
have
a
severability
statute
that
permitted
you
to
sever
out
certain
applications,
and
perhaps
you
could
do
so.
you
do
not
have
the
same
severability
statute
in
title
18.
now,
regardless
of
how
you
see
the
roots
of
stanley,
i
think
it’s
possible
perhaps
to
see
stanley
having
its
roots
as
a
first
amendment
problem,
as
a
first
amendment
right.
the
right
perhaps
to
read,
the
right
to
acquire
ideas,
perhaps
it’s
a
fourth
amendment
right
and
kind
of
a
strange
sense
that
the
home
gives
the
whole
problems
of
stanley
and
added
dimension.
perhaps
also
it’s
a
ninth
amendment
right,
just
the
right
to
be
let
alone,
the
right
to
read
and
enjoy
what
you
like.
and
if
stanley
has
fourth
amendment,
fourth
amendment
dimensions,
so
orito
also
has
added
dimensions.
although
orito
is
on
an
airplane
with
his
luggage,
and
mancusi
and
katz
tell
us
that
where
one
has
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy,
the
fourth
amendment
gives
him
such
privacy.
other
cases
speak
to
the
same
issue,
if
you
look
at
edwards
versus
california,
long
time
ago
back
in
1941,
and
more
recently
dunn
versus
blumstein,
and
still
more
recently
i
think
shapiro
versus
thompson.
we
have
another
right.
somehow
mr.
orito
has
a
right
to
travel
within
the
continental
united
states
and
no
one
can
place
a
burden
on
that
right.
i
don’t
know
that
this
court
has
ever
set
forth
clearly
what
the
roots
of
the
right
--
of
that
right
are.
but
somewhere,
somewhere
in
the
fabric
of
our
constitution
is
mr.
orito’s
right
to
go
from
washington
to
milwaukee.
and
if
he
can
go
from
washington
to
milwaukee,
if
he
can
go
one
place
to
another,
then
he
can
go
carrying
something
as
long
it
is
not
contraband.
as
long
as
it’s
not
goods
made
with
convict
made
labor,
as
long
as
it’s
not
goods
made
with
children,
as
long
as
it’s
not
contaminated
fruit,
what
mr.
orito
can
read
in
the
privacy
of
his
home
in
milwaukee,
wisconsin,
he
can
carry
with
him
to
california.
for
he
has
the
right
to
read
and
the
right
to
travel,
and
the
two
of
them
come
together
in
much
the
same
way
as
stanley
has
right
to
read
and
his
right
to
be
let
alone
in
his
own
home,
sort
of
come
together
--
mr.
james
m.
shellow
and
--
what
we
do
is
we
look
to
overbreadth.
perhaps
mr.
orito
is
transporting
this
material
in
his
luggage
for
as
a
commercial
venture.
nonetheless,
he
has
standing
to
raise
the
overbreadth
of
the
statute
as
you
recently
said
in
gooding
v.
wilson.
he
raises
the
application
even
if
you
infer
from
this
that
it’s
a
commercial
venture.
he
has
the
right
to
raise
those
whose
transportation
is
purely
personal.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
it
seems
--
mr.
james
m.
shellow
no.
all
right,
let
us,
if
you
wish.
i
am
not
prepared
to
assume
in
we
did
not
stipulate
as
reidel
did
and
as
luros
did.
we
stipulate
no
commercial
venture.
we
look
to
the
indictment
and
say
the
statute
is
overbroad.
but
even,
even
this
is
a
commercial
venture,
he
has
the
right
to
assert
the
overbreadth
of
the
statute
for
it
would
apply
to
noncommercial
transportation,
so
said
this
court
in
gooding
most
recently.
orito
was
search
to
stand.
he
comes
before
the
court
and
says
this
statute
is
no
good
and
you
can’t
construe
it
so
that
it
is
any
good.
and
that
is
why
it
doesn’t
make
any
difference.
if
in
this
case
mr.
orito
has
one
copy
of
one
dirty
magazine,
10
copies
of
films
or
150
copies,
incidentally,
there
is
nothing
in
this
indictment
which
tells
us
the
films
are
the
same.
that
is
we
don’t
know
there
copies,
i
don’t
think,
but
let
us
--
i
am
willing
to
infer
it.
i
don’t
think
it’s
central
to
my
argument
and
i
don’t
think
it’s
central
to
mr.
orito’s
right.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
i
read
united
states
v.
ross
in
which
this
court
held
you
cannot
pile
one
inference
upon
another.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
not
roth,
ross
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
fine.
let
us
assume
i’ll
concede
that
for
you
if
you
want
to
you
where
the
purpose
of
this
argument
alone
that
they
are
the
same.
must
we
conclude
from
the
fact
that
they
are
the
same
that
he
is
in
the
business?
i’ll
even
give
you
that
inference.
and
yet,
he
has
the
right
to
assume
that
this
prosecution
would
lie
if
he
had
one
deck
of
playing
cards
in
his
pocket
on
that
airplane.
you
cannot
restrict
mr.
orito’s
right
under
a
statute
which
would
restrict
my
right
to
bring
exhibits
to
this
court.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
there
is
no
stipulation
in
this
case
that
it
was
for
commercial
ventures.
if
you
wish
to
draw
the
inference
and
feel
the
inference
is
not
so
attenuated
that
it
can
be
drawn
--
mr.
james
m.
shellow
i
have
no
admissions
from
the
united
states
government
in
this
case
whatsoever,
and
we
have
no
concessions
by
the
defendant
either.
we
stand
before
the
court
and
say
the
statute
is
no
good.
it
can’t
be
applied
to
mr.
orito,
and
it
can’t
be
applied
to
mr.
zacher,
and
it
can’t
be
applied
to
me
if
i
happen
to
have
the
exhibits
in
this
case
one
copy
of
them
as
i
go
back
on
the
plane
to
milwaukee.
that
is
not
an
indictable
offense
and
it
can’t
be
made
an
indictable
offense,
and
for
carrying
exhibits
to
this
court,
i
can’t
go
to
the
penitentiary
for
five
years,
and
you
got
to
figure
out
someway
of
making
the
statute
say
that
and
you
can’t
do
it
because
the
legislative
history
is
against
you.
you
throw
the
statute
out
and
give
it
back
to
congress
and
say
give
us
a
statute
that
comports
with
the
first
amendment,
the
fourth
amendment,
the
ninth
and
maybe
the
fourteenth,
and
maybe
the
right
to
travel,
maybe
somewhere
woven
in
there
is
the
right
that
--
let
me
suggest
to
you
that
maybe
--
maybe
the
way
to
distinguish
a
way
reidel
and
luros,
and
i’m
not
awfully
happy
with
this
distinction.
but
maybe
the
way
to
distinguish
it
is
--
if
you
are
transporting
on
a
common
carrier
obscene
material,
you
seek
no
one’s
aid
but
the
common
carrier
whereas
mr.
reidel
sought
the
aid
of
the
united
states
government
in
purveying
his
stock
as
did
mr.
luros
seek
the
affirmative
assistance
of
our
customs
agency.
those
who
are
prosecuted
under
1462
seek
no
one’s
help.
we
do
not
seek
to
make
the
government
a
partner
in
this
enterprise.
we
just
seek
to
be
left
alone
and
maybe
that’s
the
distinction.
the
historic
interest
that
this
government
is
taking
unto
to
this
court
has
taken.
in
the
mails,
in
the
customs,
we
have
different
rules.
a
reading
of
a
border’s
search
problem
convinces
anyone,
do
you
know,
that
customs
problems
are
sui
generis,
even
in
the
criminal
field.
and
yet,
i
submit
to
you
that’s
a
distinction
that’s
so
viable
one
perhaps
in
this
area
of
obscenity
for
luros
was
a
custom’s
case
and
he
sought
the
government’s
help
as
reidel
sought
it
to
use
the
mails.
i
suggest
one
further
problem
the
if
the
statute
is
rewritten
by
this
court
to
add
the
phrase
that
was
deleted
in
1909
and
to
take
us
back
to
the
statute
that
was
enacted
in
1894,
that
would
we
then
not
to
be
confronted
with
a
statute
that
had
no
determinable
limits.
how
can
i
advise
anyone
at
to
what
are
the
elements
of
a
crime
if
all
that’s
necessary
is
the
intent?
i
suggest
to
you
that
you
said
in
the
campos-serrano,
not
too
long
ago
that
the
principal
restrict
them
structure
criminal
statute
demands
that
some
determinable
limits
be
established
based
upon
the
actual
words
of
the
statute.
that’s
what
mr.
justice
stewart
said.
the
actual
words
of
the
statute
don’t
place
determinable
limits
on
it.
the
actual
words
of
the
statute
make
me
criminally
liable
for
taking
these
exhibits
to
milwaukee.
actual
words
of
the
statute
actually
conform
to
what
congress
wanted
to
enact.
congress
wanted
to
enact
the
statute
that
covered
the
transportation
of
material
by
private
persons
not
for
gain,
not
for
hire,
not
for
distribution,
and
congress
enacted
such
a
law
and
the
law
is
unconstitutional,
and
we
can’t
save
it
as
much
as
we
would
like
to.
i
submit
that
the
language
that
appears
in
thirty-seven
photographs
where
the
blount
case
is
discussed
is
apposite,
where
the
court
said
that
in
blount
and
i
submit
as
in
orito,
you
are
dealing
with
the
federal
statute
and
you
have
a
power
to
give
in
an
authoritative
construction.
however,
in
this
case
as
in
blount
salvation
of
the
statute
would
have
require
to
complete
rewriting
of
it,
in
a
manner
inconsistent
with
the
expressed
intentions
of
some
of
its
authors.
the
language
was
from
blount,
but
the
application
is
crystal
clear
to
orito.
there
is
absolutely
no
way
of
escaping
the
fact
that
a
rewriting
of
the
statute
flies
in
the
face
of
what
its
authors
wanted,
of
what
they
explicitly
said
they
wanted,
and
in
that
case
--
in
this
case,
even
more
so
they
have
the
statute
that
should
have
to
rewrite
and
repealed
it
or
amended
it.
so,
i
suggest
that
we
seek
not
an
extension
really
of
stanley.
stanley
does
not
say
much
more,
i
don’t
think
that
an
individual
has
a
right
to
read
what
he
likes,
where
he
likes.
stanley
wanted
to
read
it
in
his
home,
perhaps
i
want
to
read
it
on
an
airplane.
as
long
as
i
do
not
show
it
kids
and
don’t
poke
the
person
next
to
me
and
say,
hey
look
at
my
magazine.
i
think
i
have
the
right
to
read
it.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
my
right
to
read,
my
right
to
read
on
an
airplane.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
i
think
just
as
i
have
a
right
to
be
left
alone,
so
perhaps
to
everyone
else.
and
somehow,
my
right
to
read
that
which
may
offend
others
does
not
extend
to
my
right
to
offend
them.
and
perhaps
this
court
can’t
enact
or
this
court
cannot
adjudicate
good
manners,
and
maybe
that’s
all
i
am
saying.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
of
course.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
of
course.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
i
think
--
i
think
that
--
mr.
james
m.
shellow
i
certainly
think
so.
i
think
that
the
--
i
don’t
know
the
[voice
overlap].
mr.
james
m.
shellow
the
right
not
to
be
exposed
to
loud
speakers
in
a
bus
perhaps.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
i
understand.
that’s
why
i
suggested
to
that
there
maybe
nothing
more
nor
less
than
good
manner.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
no.
i
suggest
that
the
individual’s
right
to
--
maybe
the
individual
who
rides
next
to
me
and
the
zone
of
privacy
which
surrounds
him
and
his
expectation
of
privacy,
maybe
that
imposes
upon
me
under
the
constitution,
a
correlative
obligation
not
to
invade
it.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
i
don’t
know,
i
can’t,
maybe
it’s
first
amendment,
maybe
it’s
ninth
--
mr.
james
m.
shellow
i
think
so.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
i
will
buy
that
and
i
think
that
--
thank
you.
that
is
way
i
look
at
it.[laughter]
mr.
james
m.
shellow
unless
the
government
takes
some
action
or
unless
congress
enacts
a
statute
that
says
that
he
who
thrust
obscene
material
upon
his
neighbor
on
an
airplane
shall
be
subject
to
five
years
imprisonment
and
a
fine
of
$10,000
then
maybe
that
statute
would
be
constitutional.
mr.
james
m.
shellow
short
of
congressional
action,
its
good
manners;
with
congressional
action,
it
maybe
constitutional.
under
neither
circumstance,
this
1462
withstand
analysis.
thank
you.
