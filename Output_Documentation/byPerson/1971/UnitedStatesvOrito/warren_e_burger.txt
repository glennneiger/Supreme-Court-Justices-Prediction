chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
70-69,
united
states
against
orito.
mr.
greenawalt
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
what
you
are
saying
there
that
if
mr.
stanely
for
example
wanted
to
give
the
materials
involved
in
the
stanley
case
to
someone
else,
he
would
be
violating
the
statute
if
he
sent
it
through
the
mails,
but
he
could
get
in
his
car
and
drive
from
wherever
he
lived
to
some
other
place
and
deliver
it
to
a
friend
as
a
gift?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
in
--
judge
to
that
statute
would
it
indicate
that
it
was
intended
for
--
to
deal
with
the
commercial
distribution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
we
will
pick
up
at
that
point
after
lunch.
[luncheon
break]
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
greenawalt.
mr.
shellow.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
see
if
i
follow
you.
suppose
instead
of
a
book
it
was
pictures
and
he
had
a
suitcase
full
of
them
on
the
airplane,
a
private
possession
i
suppose
in
one
sense,
would
you
say
that's
protected.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
500
of
those
pictures?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
all
the
same
pictures.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
you
think
of
any
statute
mr.
shellow
that
permits
a
jury
to
draw
inferences
of
the
kind
that
are
involved
in
drawing
inferences
about
commercial
purposes
from
the
numbers
of
more
carriers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
maybe
i
misunderstood
you.
i
thought
you
were
suggesting
that
it
imposed
an
impossible
or
a
great
unrealistic
burden
to
let
a
jury
decide
the
issues
like
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
suggest
that
stanley
would
have
been
decided
in
the
same
way
if
mr.
stanley
have
had
100
or
200
copies
of
whatever
it
was
involved
there.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
greenawalt.

general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

general
that
we
could
not
hold
the
private
use
in
the
preceding
case
protected
without
making
the
situation
you
just
described?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
district
judge
struck
down
the
statute
on
its
face,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
