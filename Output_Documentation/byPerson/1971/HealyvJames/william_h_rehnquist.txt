mr.
wulf,
are
there
any
grounds
then
upon
which
you
believe
that
the
university
or
college
could
refuse
recognition
to
a
group?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
connecticut
state
as
i
understand
it
did
not
actually
prohibit
this
organization
from
the
existing
on
the
campus,
it
is
simply
refuse
to
give
it
affirmative
recognition,
didn’t
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
mean,
membership
in
it
was
not
a
ground
for
suspension
or
expulsion
from
the
school
and
that
sort
of
thing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
ahern,
it
was
my
understanding
from
mr.
wulf’s
argument
that
he
conceives
that
a
college
is
perfectly
free
to
deny
recognition
to
all
political
organizations
and
he
says
if
you
granted
to
one,
you
must
granted
to
all
but,
i
would
think
quite
consistently
what
you’re
saying
a
college
if
it
didn’t
want
any
of
these,
i
think
you
could
deny
recognition
to
all
political
organization.

for
doing
