mr.

you
may
proceed
when
you’re

chief

i
recalled
something
in

about
questions
relating

was
there
response
to
the
effect
that
would

be
used?
chief

e.

where
is
that
in
--
chief

warren
e.

would
you
think
in
the
entire
facts
hearing
that
could
draw
that
inference
then,
that
they
might
use
of
force
and
violence
to
interrupt
classes
or
to
--
chief

warren
e.

well,
they
weren’t
talking
about
--
they
weren’t
talking
about
vietnam
war
here
in
this
colloquy.
they
were
talking
about
the
violence
on
the
campus
and
in
the
classroom.
chief

e.
burger
mr.
wulf,
suppose
that
in
this
colloquy
on
page
7,
it
had
been
developed
in
response
to
the
question
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
page
95,
excuse
me.
page
95
where
they
were
discussing
the
use
of
interruption
of
class
in
force
and
violence,
use
of
force
and
violence,
suppose
the
answer
was
we
would
reserved
the
right
to
use
force
and
violence
to
disrupt
the
classes
of
all
professors
who
did
not
denounce
the
vietnam
war
and
several
other
issues
that
they
might
identify.
would
you
think
that
would
be
enough
to
refuse
to
grant
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
reserve
the
right
to
use
force
and
violence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
then
let’s
take
it
the
next
step.
your
step,
that
they
would
use
force
and
violence
to
disrupt
the
classes
of
all
professors
who
did
not
do
certain
things
in
agreement
with
their
organizational
policies.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
be
it
easier
for
some
than
it
would
for
others
though
i
suspect.
[laughter]
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what's
the
difference?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what’s
the
difference
between
reserving
the
right
to
use
some
force
and
violence
and
announcing
the
affirmative
intent
to
use
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
doesn’t
--
wouldn’t
the
trier
of
fact
again
or
triers
of
fact
have
a
basis
for
an
inference
that
yes,
we
will
not
use
force
and
violence
if
you
will
agree
with
us
and
adopt
our
views,
but
we
will
use
force
and
violence
if
you
don’t
agree
with
us.
isn’t
that
the
thrust
of
that
kind
of
answer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn’t
the
right
of
association
extended
to
others
than
political
organization?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
wulf.
mr.
ahern.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
ahern,
i
am
looking
at
pages
94
and
95
that
we
were
discussing
after
mr.
wulf
focused
some
action
on
them.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you’ll
have
to
watch
that
microphone
that’s
very
sensitive.
was
that
the
only
meeting
or
hearing
or
inquiry
or
were
there
others
of
this
kind?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
student
committee,
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
that
score
this
is
connection
with
the
national
movement,
i
noticed
on
page
90
and
before
and
after
90,
are
these
exhibits,
committee
exhibit
number
1,
etcetera
which
quotes
“leader
of
the
sds
are
saying
we
will
have
to
destroy
at
times
even
violently
in
order
to
end
the
establishment
power
and
we
are
going
to
build
a
guerilla
force
and
we
are
engaging
in
sedition.”
now,
was
there
presentation
of
these
documents
to
the
applicants
for
this
recognition?
where
these
matters
part
of
the
record
before
that
committee?
chief

warren
e.

and
this
was
part
of
the
basis
of
the
district
judges
decision
as
distinguished
from
faculty
or
the
school?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then
the
applicants
had
an
opportunity
to
meet
it
and
explain
it?1
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
how
close
in
point
of
time
was
that
to
the
colloquy
that
appears
on
appendix
95
in
which
some
student,
one
of
the
petitioners
apparently
said
that
they
would
not
know
whether
they
would
use
violence
or
not.
chief
justice
warren
e.

that
might
be
a
little
more
convenient
if
you
of
course
give
a
copy
to
mr.
wulf.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
position
of
the
state
that
you’ve
suggested,
would
that
interfere
with
the
right
of
the
individuals
that
are
before
the
court
and
any
in
their
friends
to
past

belief
