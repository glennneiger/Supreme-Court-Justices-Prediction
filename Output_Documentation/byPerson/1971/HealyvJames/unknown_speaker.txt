are

unknown

mr.
wulf,
let
me
get
straightened
out
as
you
described
the
application,
now
you
refer
to
themselves
as
a
chapter
of
sds,
am
i
correct
in
that
impression?
unknown
speaker
and
yet,
they
disavow
in
the
affiliation
according
to
later
words?
unknown
speaker
had
some
of
these
applicants
been
members
of
other
chapters
elsewhere?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
one
of
them
had
some
michigan
state
affiliation?
unknown
speaker
who
is
barbara
healy?
unknown
speaker
and
appendix
81
says
member
of
michigan
state
chapter?
unknown
speaker
so,
if
the
answer
to
the
question
had
been
a
yes,
we
can
envision
it
and
we
might
very
well
do
so,
your
answer
would
be
the
same?
unknown
speaker
nor
the
ku
klux
klan.
unknown
speaker
well,
1915
was
before
the
court
had
applied
the
first
amendment
to
the
states.
unknown
speaker
well
don’t
you
think
discriminatory
organizations
might
be
bearable
because
recognition
involves
the
state,
the
college
extending
the
use
of
its
own
facilities
for
those
organizations?
unknown
speaker
because
it
does
involve
recognition
in
the
sense
that
the
state
approves
it,
authorizes
them
as
an
affirmative
authorization
to
operate
and
it’s
a
making
available
of
state
facilities
for
meetings
and
things?
unknown
speaker
that
case
state
that
furnish
the
chapter
house
for
a
white
anglo-saxon
organization?
unknown
speaker
well,
it’s
whatever
you
want
to
call
it.
unknown
speaker
oh,
this
is
a
right
of
association
in
the
sense
that
it’s
a
discussion
organization.
they
learn.
it’s
part
of
the
whole
educational
process.
unknown
speaker
i
guess
what
surprise
you
haven’t
really
challenged
this
whole
process
of
accrediting?
you
don’t
challenge
a
fair
or
you
haven’t
challenge
the
right
of
the
state
to
have
rules
for
recognition?
unknown
speaker
close
to
this
procedure?
you
don’t
challenge
the
standards
they
use?
unknown
speaker
would
you
think
the
state
may
go
through
the
procedure
of
making
you
--
making
organizations
to
tell
about
themselves?
unknown
speaker
tell
me
mr.
wulf
because
you’re
talking
only
about
public
supported
institutions?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wulf,
i
think
you
mentioned
at
the
outset
that
the
student
organization’s
had
access
to
some
college
or
student
funds,
what
did
you
had
in
mind
now?
unknown
