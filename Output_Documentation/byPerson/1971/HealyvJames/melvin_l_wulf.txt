mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
out
of
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
question
that
presents
is
whether
the
first
amendment
forbids
the
president
of
a
state
college
from
refusing
official
recognition
to
a
student
political
organization
when
the
decision
is
based
only
upon
undifferentiated
fear
or
apprehension
of
disturbance.
the
facts
of
the
case
are:
that
the
petitioners
in
this
case
following
the
applicable
rules
of
the
college,
central
connecticut
state
college,
submitted
an
application
for
recognition
of
a
local
chapter
of
the
students
for
a
democratic
society.
the
fact
of
recognition
has
significant
consequences
because
without
it,
a
student
group
cannot
meet
on
campus,
cannot
make
use
of
any
of
the
college’s
facilities,
cannot
sponsor
meetings
on
campus,
cannot
make
use
of
the
student
newspaper,
nor
use
of
the
student
bulletin
boards
nor
can
it
make
application
for
student
funds.
but
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
two
of
them
are
sir.
tess
and
doyle
are
still
duly
enrolled
at
the
college,
yes.
the
application
that
they
submitted
and
i
want
to
read
it
and
its
entirety
because
it’s
really
the
foundation
of
our
assertions
about
their
first
amendment
claim.
said
that
they
would
like
to
form
a
local
chapter
of
students
for
democratic
society,
and
they
gave
three
reasons.
they
said
because
the
university
is
intended
to
be
the
arena
of
education
where
there
is
an
unfettered
exchange
of
ideas.
sds
would
provide
a
form
of
discussion
in
self
education
for
students
developing
an
analysis
of
american
society
institutions
including
higher
education
and
a
world
situation
in
general.
they
said
that
sds
would
provide
an
agency
for
integrating
thought
with
action,
so
as
to
bring
about
constructive
changes
in
the
university,
in
american
life
and
the
world.
and
thirdly,
they
said
that
sds
would
provide
a
coordinating
body
for
relating
the
problems
of
leftist
students
and
other
groups
such
as
the
student
body
as
a
whole,
the
working
class,
the
black
populace
or
whatever
other
individuals
or
groups
in
fact
or
potentially
in
accord
with
the
purposes
of
the
central
connecticut
state
college
chapter
of
sds.
that
application
was
submitted
a
joint
student
faculty
committee
called
the
student
activities
committee,
and
the
petitioners
came
before
the
committee
who
raised
a
few
questions
with
them.
they
themselves,
the
committee
was
concerned
about
evidence
of
violent
responsive,
the
national
sds
organization
at
local
sds
chapters
throughout
the
country.
and
they
asked
the
petitioners
about
what
their
ties
would
be
to
the
national
sds?
and
the
student’s
replied,
this
is
on
page
94
of
the
appendix
that
the
chapter
does
not
affiliate
with
the
national
organization.
they
said,
we
will
be
completely
independent
and
when
asked
why
the
chapter
--
why
they
carry
to
use
the
name
of
national
sds.
they
said
because
the
name
brings
to
mind
the
type
of
organization
we
wish
to
bring
across.
that
is
a
left
wing
organization
which
will
allow
the
student’s
interested
in
such
to
express
themselves.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
it’s
a
joint
student
faculty
committee.
i
do
not
know
what
the
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
think
yes.
one
of
deans,
judd
who
was
later
serve
as
the
hearing
officer
as
a
matter
of
fact
was
a
member
of
that
same
committee.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
no,
we
do
not.
but
the
university
--
well,
we
know
as
a
fact
that
principal
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
it’s
a
--
some
of
the
wholly
states
afforded
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
it
does
grant
a
graduate
--
graduate
master’s
degree
as
a
matter
of
fact.
it
has
7,000
according
to
its
catalog
which
i
have
here.
there
are
7,000
full
time
day
students
and
additional
15,000
evening
and
summer
students.
it’s
a
fairly,
fairly
large
place.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
new
britain
sir.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
wholly
state
support.
it’s
part
of
the
connecticut
state
college
system.
yes,
sir.
fully-type
supportive.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
they
did,
yes
sir.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
they
originally
--
in
there
recent
application,
they
described
themselves
as
a
local
chapter
of
sds.
although
they
described
themselves
as
that,
they
protested
that
they
would
not
have
ties
to
the
national
sds
organization.
subsequently,
i
presumably
in
order
to
try
to
meet
the
objections
that
various
people
made
to
the
national
sds,
they
said
that
they
would
call
themselves
ccsc-sds
which
is
a
lot
of
initials
but
specifically
withdrawing
their
description
as
being
a
local
chapter.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
the
record
doesn’t
show
sir
and
i
don’t
know.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
their
faculty
adviser
had
when
he
was
a
graduate
student
of
michigan
state
university,
been
a
member
of
sds
out
there.
and
he
testified
at
the
hearing
for
the
purpose
of
supporting
petitioners
claim
that
there
could
be
such
a
thing
as
a
local
sds
chapter
that
didn’t
really
have
any
official
formal
--
certainly
formal
affiliation
with
national
sds
that
local
chapters
could
be
totally
independent.
he
said
that
was
the
way
his
chapter
had
functioned
at
michigan
state
university.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
she
is
one
of
the
student
petitioners,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
appendix
81.
oh,
no!
i
am
sorry.
that
catherine
healy
is
our
petitioner
student.
barbara
healy,
this
is
an
excerpt
from
a
hearing
of
the
house
internal
security
committee
which
was
introduced
at
the
hearing
by
the
hearing
officer
in
order
to
try
to
show
an
inevitable
relationship
between
local
sds
chapters
and
national
sds,
and
this
was
a
membership
card
that
the
house
committee
had
acquired
somehow
or
rather
i
don’t
know
how.
but
it
was
one
of
the
number
of
--
there
is
one
in
the
proceeding
page
2.
she
is
a
different.
she
is
a
different
ms.
healy.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
that’s
right.
that
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
that’s
on
page
95
of
the
appendix
and
it’s
part
of
the
same
meeting
of
the
student
affairs
committee
which
i
referred
to
a
little
earlier.
and
i
was
next
going
to
describe
that
q&a
that
took
place
at
that
hearing.
the
committee
members
asked
ms.
healy,
how
would
you
respond
to
issues
of
violence
as
other
sds
chapters
have?
it
seems
a
little
garbled
but
that
is
the
way
it
is
in
the
original
transcript.
and
her
answer
was
her
action
would
have
to
be
dependent
upon
each
issue.
would
you
use
any
means
possible?
no,
i
can’t
say
that.
we’d
not
know
until
we
know
what
the
issues
are.
and
question
seven
was,
could
you
envision
the
sds
interrupting
a
class
impossible
for
me
to
say.
but
with
that
comes
to
and
i
am
going
to
deal
with
that
later
on
in
my
argument
is
not
withstanding
the
ambiguity,
terrible
ambiguity
of
the
question
and
the
equal
ambiguity
of
the
answers,
we
would
conceived
that
at
most,
it’s
a
refusal
to
renounce
the
use
of
violence
under
all
circumstances.
but
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
no.
i
don’
think
that
they
could
draw
the
inference
that
they
might
use
it.
i
think
that
they
must
draw
that
the
furthest
inference
they
can
draw
is
that
these
people
are
not
pacifists,
that
they
would
not
under
all
circumstances
renounce
the
use
of
violence.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
precisely,
and
the
whole
thrust
of
our
argument
is
regardless
of
these
answers,
regardless
of
these
answers
and
taking
it
for
counter
ambiguity
that
the
local
chapter
had
to
be
recognized
because
to
refuse
to
do
so
is
a
forbidden
prior
restraint
and
then
and
only
then
should
these
petitioners
engage
in
conduct
which
is
either
illegal
and
would
be
prosecuted
or
with
be
a
misconduct
for
purposes
of
the
school
administration
and
could
be
dealt
with
as
a
local
disciplinary
problem
only
until
that
point
when
that
point
was
reached
if
it
ever
was
reached
because
this
is
not
a
guarantee
that
their
by
any
means
that
they
are
going
to
engage
in
any
illegal
or
violent
conduct,
but
only
that
they
did
not
renounce
it.
but
if
and
when
they
did
in
engage
in
the
forbidden
conduct,
then
sanctions
could
be
taken
appropriately
against
them.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
precisely
i
say
yes.
yes,
sir.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
no,
not
at
all.
i
think
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
that
is
the
issue
as
the
respondents
and
their
friends
in
court
make
it
because
they
find
to
put
sds
on
trial
and
our
perspective
of
course
is
that
it’s
the
petitioners
who
are
before
this
court
and
not
sds
and
you’ll
find
very
little
in
the
record,
very
little
in
the
record,
very
little
in
the
respondent’s
brief
about
the
petitioners.
but
our
claim
of
course
is
that
it’s
the
petitioners
who
are
making
the
application
here.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
surely,
surely
sir.
but
i
accept
my
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
perhaps
i
was
misled
by
its
being
introduced
as
a
red
herring
by
the
respondents
and
i
try
to
deal
with
it.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
i
accept
my
client’s
claims
that
they
intended
not
to
have
any
affiliation
with
national
sds.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
it
doesn’t
make
any
difference
in
my
argument
because
even
if
as
initially,
they
said
they
want
to
be
a
local
chapter
of
sds,
and
if
they
were
in
fact,
going
to
have
a
formal
relationship
with
sds,
my
argument
will
still
be
the
same.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
think
that
on
a
whole,
the
answer
that
would
be
no.
i
think
that
if
on
a
face
of
an
application,
a
student
group
wanted
to
organize
for
the
purpose
of
engaging
and
admittedly
illegal
acts,
students
to
engage
in
bank
robbing
for
example,
i
think
that
they
could
deny
that
kind
of
an
application.
but
when
the
application
is
for
bona
fide
a
political
organization,
i
think
that
the
university
or
the
college
has
to
look
to
the
individual
applicants
to
see
what
their
criteria
--
what
their
characteristics
are.
i
don’t
think
they
can
look
very
far
as
to
what
their
characters
are.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
predominant
--
if
they
were
predominantly
political,
they
would
have
the
--
college
would
have
to
grant
the
application
and
would
have
to
wait
to
see
whether
they
in
fact
engage
in
any
illegal
conduct.
i
don’t
think
that
where
first
amendment
rights
are
at
issue
that
the
state
can
make
predictions
even
on
the
basis
of
assertions
by
the
citizens
themselves
that
they
might
engage
in
some
illegal
conduct,
that
the
state
cannot
predict,
that
they
will,
and
that
the
purpose
of
that
first
amendment
of
course
is
to
try
to
discourage
people
from
engaging
in
illegal
conduct
and
it
might
well
be
that
upon
participating
in
the
political
process,
those
who
might
be
dispose
towards
illegal
conduct
will
be
discourage
from
engaging
in
the
illegal
conduct.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
what
page
sir?
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
did
they
say
they
would
only
they
will
exercise
it
or
merely
reserve
it?
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
it
cannot
be
denied.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
that
would
be
a
hard
case
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
don’t
know
if
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
do
not
know
if
i
would
be
here
arguing
that
case
frankly
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
but
if
the
intention
was
that
immediately
upon
recognition,
they
were
going
to
go
out
and
disrupt
classes
imminently,
immediately,
go
out
and
disrupt
classes
professors
who
do
not
agree
with
their
politics,
probably
it
could
be
denied.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
the
difference
is
that
they
may
might
well
be
talked
out
of
it
between
the
time
that
their
organization
is
granted
recognition
and
the
time
that
they
would
otherwise
have
engage
in
disrupted
acts
and
that’s,
as
i
said
before
is
all
purpose
of
the
first
amendment
is
to
allow
these
free
kind
of
political
dialogue
and
i
am
sure
all
of
us
here
hope
of
results
in
the
abolition
of
the
use
of
force.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
that
maybe
the
thrust
sir,
but
i
still
do
not
think
it’s
adequate
upon,
ground
upon
which
to
deny
a
person,
citizen
--
a
citizen
who
the
right
to
exercise
his
first
amendment
rights
because
that
to
notwithstanding
his
assertions
the
he
might
use
it
would
be
a
forbidden
prior
restraint
because
the
state
cannot
make
these
kinds
of
prediction.
again,
even
if
the
applicants
do
not
renounce
the
use
of
violence.
i
mean,
there
are
people
who
would
renounce
the
use
of
violence,
but
some
circumstances
might
emerge
where
they
would
find
themselves
in
the
midst
of
it
and
participate
at
it.
but
the
point
is
that
in
this
kind
of
situation
where
it
is
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights
being
made
by
citizens,
students
in
this
particular
case,
the
state
has
no
right
really
to
even
catechize
about
what
their
views
are
about
the
use
of
violence.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well
here,
i
am
referring
to
specifically
to
the
right
of
speech
and
the
right
of
association.
both
of
them
are
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
which
is
the
case
here.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
without
reservation,
yes
that’s
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
think
it
probably
could
and
probably
has
band
organizations
which
themselves
exercise.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
racial
religious
discrimination.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
i
do
not
think
that
those
are
political
organizations.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
the
ku
klux
klan
for
example.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
don’t
that
they
could
be
band
at
all
on
the
same
principle
that
that
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
nor
the
ku
klux
klan
of
course.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
this
court
is
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
this
court
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
1915
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
in
the
war
case
said
that
abandon
mississippi
upon
greek
letter
fraternities
of
the
university
of
mississippi
was
not
unconstitutional
but
there
wasn’t
any
first
amendment
claim
in
that
case.
it
was
is
an
equal
protection
claim
and
a
due
process
claim
and
i
am
not
so
sure
that
there
would
not
be
a
different
--
well,
that
there
could
not
be
a
strong
first
amendment
argument
made
on
behalf
of
greek
letter
fraternities
here
today
compared
to
50
or
60
years
ago
whatever
the
case
was.
but
i
do
not
think
that
the
war
case
really
has
any
bearing
here
because
we
decide
well
before,
the
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
before
this
court
articulated
the
first
amendment
and
its
modern
cause
at
all
and
i
think
there
might
well
be
a
difference
decision
in
war.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
that’s
true
sir,
yes.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
that
has
in
fact
i
think
in
the
argument
to
support
the
forbidding
such
organizations
on
college
campuses.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes
and
it
would
be
easy
although
i
am
not
so
sure
that
you
could
press
that
same
argument
with
respect
to
the
ku
klux
klan
on
a
state-supported
university.
i
think
the
state-supported
university
has
a
first
amendment
duty
to
allow
the
formation
in
our
campus
of
a
chapter
of
a
ku
klux
klan.
but
it
has
the
same
duty
to
continue
to
recognize
a
greek
letter
fraternity
which
discriminates
against
jews,
blacks
and
every
minority
group.
i
do
not
know.
i
am
not
prepared
to
argue
that.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
are
they
greek
letter
social
organization?
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
i
think
there
is
a
distinction
to
be
draw
between
organizations
which
are
political
as
difficult
as
that
might
be
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
that
was
the
argument
we're
here,
of
course
and
unsuccessful
in
1915
and
perhaps
a
successor
would
make
it
equally
unsuccessfully
now.
but
i
think
without
being
able
right
now
to
draw
the
distinctions,
i
think
there
is
an
arguable
distinction
between
a
group
which
is
predominantly
political
like
sds
and
a
group
which
is
predominantly
social.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
ah
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
really
don’t
know
who
would
decide
that.
i
really
don’t
know.
i
think
this
court
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
that
is
and
that’s
why
i
feel
i
am
getting
myself
into
a
thicket
by
trying
to
argue
the
fraternity
case
when
it’s
really
not
the
case
before
us
and
because
there
--
what
i
say
that
that
would
be
argued
differently
here,
the
aclu
might
in
fact
be
the
group
that
would
arguing
it
here
because
there
might
well
be
enough
of
a
associational
right
to
justify
a
very
strong
first
amendment
claim
on
behalf
of
greek
letter
fraternities.
and
although,
i
am
talking
in
terms
of
distinctions,
it
may
be
that
i
might
end
up
believing
there
aren’t
any
viable
distinctions
between
social
and
political
groups.
i
think
the
right
to
associate
in
social
organizations
is
not
less
important
in
the
right
to
associate
in
political
organization.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well
the
petitioners
here,
begging
your
pardon
said
they
didn’t
say
that.
but
if
it
were
a
secret
society,
i
think
that
there
is
probably
some
duty
as
some
initial
duty
which
the
petitioners
here
follow
to
disclose
what
the
purpose
of
the
organization
is.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
and
they
are
seeking
recognition
on
the
college
campus?
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
think,
well,
i
am
really
not
familiar
with
those
secret
societies
on
campus
which
you
referred
to.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
really
can’t
believe
that
they
are
so
secret,
perhaps
you
are
talking
about
skull
and
bones
about
which
i
have
--
i
don’t
know
whether
that
is
one
of
them
or
not.
i
think
yale
has
one
or
two
secret
societies,
but
i
really
can’t
believe
that
the
offices
at
yale
don’t
know
what
those
secret
societies
are
up
to.
i
think
they
have
a
right
to
know.
i
don’t
think
that
a
student
group
has
a
right
to
official
recognition
by
a
college
or
university
unless
they
disclose
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
no,
we
don’t.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
it’s
not
challenged
in
this
case
--
no,
we
don’t.
it’s
not
challenged
in
this
case
and
we
do
not
challenge
the
standards
here.
well,
there
really
weren’t
any
standards
because
that
part
of
the
college
rule
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
don’t
take
the
position
here
that
a
university
has
to
give
blanket
recognition
to
groups
which
want
to
function
as
student
organizations
which
invoke
the
--
which
use
the
name
of
the
college
in
which
they
are
organized.
now,
i
think
there
is
probably
that
minimal
obligation
by
student
groups
or
a
minimal
right
by
the
universities
for
purposes
of
regulation
or
simply
to
know
--
the
regulation
really
is
a
time,
place
and
matter
regulation.
they
have
a
right
to
require
these
student
organizations
to
be
formally
recognized
so
that
they
can
distribute
the
limited
facilities
of
the
university
on
an
equitable
basis.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
no,
in
this
case,
without
recognition,
this
organization
and
according
to
the
respondents,
any
organization
simply
could
not
function
as
an
organization
on
the
campus.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
no,
but
they
simply
could
not
function
in
their
organizational
role
on
the
campus.
they
could
not
meet.
in
fact,
the
record
reflects
a
meeting
that
these
petitioners,
these
very
petitioners
held
after
the
initial
district
court
decision
in
order
to
discuss
what
they
would
do
next
and
they
met
in
a
campus
snack
bar,
and
they
are
immediately
served
with
a
typewritten
notice
by
the
dean
to
disperse
because
they
said
that
they
were
meeting
as
the
formal
sds
group
and
since
they
were
not
recognized,
they
could
not
meet
even
there
in
the
coffee
shop.
so,
denial
here,
they
can
probably
be
members
of
sds
somewhere
else,
but
that
does
not
serve
their
purposes
as
members
of
the
community
if
central
connecticut
state
college.
they
want
to
be
able
to
function
on
the
campus
as
a
group,
use
the
school’s
facility
and
talk
to
their
fellow
student
as
an
organized
political
organization.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
the
only
thing
is
the
record
is
at
the
first
meeting
of
the
student
affairs
committee
in
the
appendix
at
page
95,
one
of
the
questions
is
would
you
seek
funds
from
student
government?
and
the
answer
is
yes.
so
therefore,
i
assume
that
recognized
organizations
are
entitled
to
seek
funds
from
student
government.
but
that
is
all
that
appears
in
the
record.
our
basic
claim
is
that
in
this
case,
there
is
no
reference
at
all
in
the
hearing,
in
the
record
about
these
petitioners.
it
is
all
about
sds.
but
as
these
petitioners
who
are
making
the
claim
to
function
as
a
political
organization
on
this
campus.
we
think
that
the
refusal
on
this
record
or
on
this
record
was
a
prior
restraint
based
entirely
on
a
guilt
by
association,
and
i
must
say
that
the
version
of
the
first
amendment
urged
upon
you
by
the
respondents
and
their
friends
in
court
is
would
be
so
severely
radical
a
departure
from
normal
traditional
standards
of
first
amendment
law
as
articulated
by
this
court
over
the
years
that
i
urge
you
to
reject
their
version.
and,
i
would
like
to
save
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal,
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
would
just
like
to
close
by
saying
that
mr.
ahern’s
arguments
confirms
are
fundamental
claim
that
the
respondent
is
not
arguing
this
case.
it
is
arguing
some
other
case.
there
is
nothing
in
this
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
do
not
think
that
make
any
difference
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
–
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
think
that
they
have
a
minimal
responsibility
to
describe
what
the
purpose
of
their
--
what
purpose
of
the
organization
is.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
if
they
have
made
a
prima
facie
showing
on
their
application
that
they
intent
to
engage
in
protected
political
activity,
they
cannot
add
be
ask
that
question
if
they
don’t
volunteer
it.
if
they
were
asked
here
and
they
did
volunteer
to
answer
it,
but
if
they
refuse
to
answer
to
answer
it,
i
think
that
the
fundamental
first
amendment
know
should
still
require
that
they
granted
recognition
and
that
the
administration
by
the
event
of
any
of
illegal
conduct.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
no,
i
think
that
that
was
very
short
hand
way
of
expressing
a
philosophical
view
that
rejects
non-violence.
i
don’t
think
that
it
was
a
reply
that
said
none
of
your
business.
i
mean
it
quite
--
certainly
to
try
to
engage
people
in
the
philosophy
of
violence
in
that
short
hand
kind
of
way
is
never
going
to
be
successful.
but
i
think,
i
disagree
that
it
was
a
response
that
said,
none
of
your
business,
i
think
they
answered
it.
they
certainly
didn’t
say
that
they
did
not
believe
in
violence
and
to
that
extent,
they
are
terribly
candid.
they
said
we
can’t
say
under
some
conditions
that
we
might
not
do
it,
but
that
is
not
ample
reason
under
first
amendment
law
to
prohibit
the
exercise
of
their
first
amendment
rights.
the
state
has
to
wait
and
see.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
out
of
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
question
that
presents
is
whether
the
first
amendment
forbids
the
president
of
a
state
college
from
refusing
official
recognition
to
a
student
political
organization
when
the
decision
is
based
only
upon
undifferentiated
fear
or
apprehension
of
disturbance.
the
facts
of
the
case
are:
that
the
petitioners
in
this
case
following
the
applicable
rules
of
the
college,
central
connecticut
state
college,
submitted
an
application
for
recognition
of
a
local
chapter
of
the
students
for
a
democratic
society.
the
fact
of
recognition
has
significant
consequences
because
without
it,
a
student
group
cannot
meet
on
campus,
cannot
make
use
of
any
of
the
college’s
facilities,
cannot
sponsor
meetings
on
campus,
cannot
make
use
of
the
student
newspaper,
nor
use
of
the
student
bulletin
boards
nor
can
it
make
application
for
student
funds.
but
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
two
of
them
are
sir.
tess
and
doyle
are
still
duly
enrolled
at
the
college,
yes.
the
application
that
they
submitted
and
i
want
to
read
it
and
its
entirety
because
it’s
really
the
foundation
of
our
assertions
about
their
first
amendment
claim.
said
that
they
would
like
to
form
a
local
chapter
of
students
for
democratic
society,
and
they
gave
three
reasons.
they
said
because
the
university
is
intended
to
be
the
arena
of
education
where
there
is
an
unfettered
exchange
of
ideas.
sds
would
provide
a
form
of
discussion
in
self
education
for
students
developing
an
analysis
of
american
society
institutions
including
higher
education
and
a
world
situation
in
general.
they
said
that
sds
would
provide
an
agency
for
integrating
thought
with
action,
so
as
to
bring
about
constructive
changes
in
the
university,
in
american
life
and
the
world.
and
thirdly,
they
said
that
sds
would
provide
a
coordinating
body
for
relating
the
problems
of
leftist
students
and
other
groups
such
as
the
student
body
as
a
whole,
the
working
class,
the
black
populace
or
whatever
other
individuals
or
groups
in
fact
or
potentially
in
accord
with
the
purposes
of
the
central
connecticut
state
college
chapter
of
sds.
that
application
was
submitted
a
joint
student
faculty
committee
called
the
student
activities
committee,
and
the
petitioners
came
before
the
committee
who
raised
a
few
questions
with
them.
they
themselves,
the
committee
was
concerned
about
evidence
of
violent
responsive,
the
national
sds
organization
at
local
sds
chapters
throughout
the
country.
and
they
asked
the
petitioners
about
what
their
ties
would
be
to
the
national
sds?
and
the
student’s
replied,
this
is
on
page
94
of
the
appendix
that
the
chapter
does
not
affiliate
with
the
national
organization.
they
said,
we
will
be
completely
independent
and
when
asked
why
the
chapter
--
why
they
carry
to
use
the
name
of
national
sds.
they
said
because
the
name
brings
to
mind
the
type
of
organization
we
wish
to
bring
across.
that
is
a
left
wing
organization
which
will
allow
the
student’s
interested
in
such
to
express
themselves.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
it’s
a
joint
student
faculty
committee.
i
do
not
know
what
the
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
think
yes.
one
of
deans,
judd
who
was
later
serve
as
the
hearing
officer
as
a
matter
of
fact
was
a
member
of
that
same
committee.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
no,
we
do
not.
but
the
university
--
well,
we
know
as
a
fact
that
principal
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
it’s
a
--
some
of
the
wholly
states
afforded
--
mr.
melvin

it
does
grant
a

graduate
master’s
degree
as
a
matter
of
fact.
it
has
7,000
according
to
its

which
i
have
here.
there
are
7,000
full
time
day
students
and
additional
15,000

and
summer
students.
it’s
a
fairly,
fairly
large
place.
mr.

sir.
mr.

it’s

of
the
connecticut
state
college
system.
yes,
sir.
fully-type
supportive.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
they
did,
yes
sir.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
they
originally
--
in
there
recent
application,
they
described
themselves
as
a
local
chapter
of
sds.
although
they
described
themselves
as
that,
they
protested
that
they
would
not
have
ties
to
the
national
sds
organization.
subsequently,
i
presumably
in
order
to
try
to
meet
the
objections
that
various
people
made
to
the
national
sds,
they
said
that
they
would
call
themselves
ccsc-sds
which
is
a
lot
of
initials
but
specifically
withdrawing
their
description
as
being
a
local
chapter.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
the
record
doesn’t
show
sir
and
i
don’t
know.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
their
faculty
adviser
had
when
he
was
a
graduate
student
of
michigan
state
university,
been
a
member
of
sds
out
there.
and
he
testified
at
the
hearing
for
the
purpose
of
supporting
petitioners
claim
that
there
could
be
such
a
thing
as
a
local
sds
chapter
that
didn’t
really
have
any
official
formal
--
certainly
formal
affiliation
with
national
sds
that
local
chapters
could
be
totally
independent.
he
said
that
was
the
way
his
chapter
had
functioned
at
michigan
state
university.

barbara
healy,
this
is
an
excerpt
from
a
hearing
of
the
house
internal
security
committee
which
was
introduced
at
the
hearing
by
the
hearing
officer
in
order
to
try
to
show
an
inevitable
relationship
between
local
sds
chapters
and
national
sds,
and
this
was
a
membership
card
that
the
house
committee
had
acquired
somehow
or
rather
i
don’t
know
how.
but
it
was
one
of

she
is

ms.
healy.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
that’s
right.
that
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
that’s
on
page
95
of
the
appendix
and
it’s
part
of
the
same
meeting
of
the
student
affairs
committee
which
i
referred
to
a
little
earlier.
and
i
was
next
going
to
describe
that
q&a
that
took
place
at
that
hearing.
the
committee
members
asked
ms.
healy,
how
would
you
respond
to
issues
of
violence
as
other
sds
chapters
have?
it
seems
a
little
garbled
but
that
is
the
way
it
is
in
the
original
transcript.
and
her
answer
was
her
action
would
have
to
be
dependent
upon
each
issue.
would
you
use
any
means
possible?
no,
i
can’t
say
that.
we’d
not
know
until
we
know
what
the
issues
are.
and
question
seven
was,
could
you
envision
the
sds
interrupting
a
class
impossible
for
me
to
say.
but
with
that
comes
to
and
i
am
going
to
deal
with
that
later
on
in
my
argument
is
not
withstanding
the
ambiguity,
terrible
ambiguity
of
the
question
and
the
equal
ambiguity
of
the
answers,
we
would
conceived
that
at
most,
it’s
a
refusal
to
renounce
the
use
of
violence
under
all
circumstances.
but
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
no.
i
don’
think
that
they
could
draw
the
inference
that
they
might
use
it.
i
think
that
they
must
draw
that
the
furthest
inference
they
can
draw
is
that
these
people
are
not
pacifists,
that
they
would
not
under
all
circumstances
renounce
the
use
of
violence.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
precisely,
and
the
whole
thrust
of
our
argument
is
regardless
of
these
answers,
regardless
of
these
answers
and
taking
it
for
counter
ambiguity
that
the
local
chapter
had
to
be
recognized
because
to
refuse
to
do
so
is
a
forbidden
prior
restraint
and
then
and
only
then
should
these
petitioners
engage
in
conduct
which
is
either
illegal
and
would
be
prosecuted
or
with
be
a
misconduct
for
purposes
of
the
school
administration
and
could
be
dealt
with
as
a
local
disciplinary
problem
only
until
that
point
when
that
point
was
reached
if
it
ever
was
reached
because
this
is
not
a
guarantee
that
their
by
any
means
that
they
are
going
to
engage
in
any
illegal
or
violent
conduct,
but
only
that
they
did
not
renounce
it.
but
if
and
when
they
did
in
engage
in
the
forbidden
conduct,
then
sanctions
could
be
taken
appropriately
against
them.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
precisely
i
say
yes.
yes,
sir.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
no,
not
at
all.
i
think
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
that
is
the
issue
as
the
respondents
and
their
friends
in
court
make
it
because
they
find
to
put
sds
on
trial
and
our
perspective
of
course
is
that
it’s
the
petitioners
who
are
before
this
court
and
not
sds
and
you’ll
find
very
little
in
the
record,
very
little
in
the
record,
very
little
in
the
respondent’s
brief
about
the
petitioners.
but
our
claim
of
course
is
that
it’s
the
petitioners
who
are
making
the
application
here.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
surely,
surely
sir.
but
i
accept
my
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
perhaps
i
was
misled
by
its
being
introduced
as
a
red
herring
by
the
respondents
and
i
try
to
deal
with
it.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
i
accept
my
client’s
claims
that
they
intended
not
to
have
any
affiliation
with
national
sds.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
it
doesn’t
make
any
difference
in
my
argument
because
even
if
as
initially,
they
said
they
want
to
be
a
local
chapter
of
sds,
and
if
they
were
in
fact,
going
to
have
a
formal
relationship
with
sds,
my
argument
will
still
be
the
same.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
think
that
on
a
whole,
the
answer
that
would
be
no.
i
think
that
if
on
a
face
of
an
application,
a
student
group
wanted
to
organize
for
the
purpose
of
engaging
and
admittedly
illegal
acts,
students
to
engage
in
bank
robbing
for
example,
i
think
that
they
could
deny
that
kind
of
an
application.
but
when
the
application
is
for
bona
fide
a
political
organization,
i
think
that
the
university
or
the
college
has
to
look
to
the
individual
applicants
to
see
what
their
criteria
--
what
their
characteristics
are.
i
don’t
think
they
can
look
very
far
as
to
what
their
characters
are.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
predominant
--
if
they
were
predominantly
political,
they
would
have
the
--
college
would
have
to
grant
the
application
and
would
have
to
wait
to
see
whether
they
in
fact
engage
in
any
illegal
conduct.
i
don’t
think
that
where
first
amendment
rights
are
at
issue
that
the
state
can
make
predictions
even
on
the
basis
of
assertions
by
the
citizens
themselves
that
they
might
engage
in
some
illegal
conduct,
that
the
state
cannot
predict,
that
they
will,
and
that
the
purpose
of
that
first
amendment
of
course
is
to
try
to
discourage
people
from
engaging
in
illegal
conduct
and
it
might
well
be
that
upon
participating
in
the
political
process,
those
who
might
be
dispose
towards
illegal
conduct
will
be
discourage
from
engaging
in
the
illegal
conduct.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
what
page
sir?
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
did
they
say
they
would
only
they
will
exercise
it
or
merely
reserve
it?
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
it
cannot
be
denied.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
that
would
be
a
hard
case
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
don’t
know
if
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
do
not
know
if
i
would
be
here
arguing
that
case
frankly
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
but
if
the
intention
was
that
immediately
upon
recognition,
they
were
going
to
go
out
and
disrupt
classes
imminently,
immediately,
go
out
and
disrupt
classes
professors
who
do
not
agree
with
their
politics,
probably
it
could
be
denied.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
the
difference
is
that
they
may
might
well
be
talked
out
of
it
between
the
time
that
their
organization
is
granted
recognition
and
the
time
that
they
would
otherwise
have
engage
in
disrupted
acts
and
that’s,
as
i
said
before
is
all
purpose
of
the
first
amendment
is
to
allow
these
free
kind
of
political
dialogue
and
i
am
sure
all
of
us
here
hope
of
results
in
the
abolition
of
the
use
of
force.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
that
maybe
the
thrust
sir,
but
i
still
do
not
think
it’s
adequate
upon,
ground
upon
which
to
deny
a
person,
citizen
--
a
citizen
who
the
right
to
exercise
his
first
amendment
rights
because
that
to
notwithstanding
his
assertions
the
he
might
use
it
would
be
a
forbidden
prior
restraint
because
the
state
cannot
make
these
kinds
of
prediction.
again,
even
if
the
applicants
do
not
renounce
the
use
of
violence.
i
mean,
there
are
people
who
would
renounce
the
use
of
violence,
but
some
circumstances
might
emerge
where
they
would
find
themselves
in
the
midst
of
it
and
participate
at
it.
but
the
point
is
that
in
this
kind
of
situation
where
it
is
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights
being
made
by
citizens,
students
in
this
particular
case,
the
state
has
no
right
really
to
even
catechize
about
what
their
views
are
about
the
use
of
violence.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well
here,
i
am
referring
to
specifically
to
the
right
of
speech
and
the
right
of
association.
both
of
them
are
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
which
is
the
case
here.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
without
reservation,
yes
that’s
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
think
it
probably
could
and
probably
has
band
organizations
which
themselves
exercise.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
racial
religious
discrimination.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
i
do
not
think
that
those
are
political
organizations.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
the
ku
klux
klan
for
example.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
don’t
that
they
could
be
band
at
all
on
the
same
principle
that
that
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
nor
the
ku
klux
klan
of
course.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
this
court
is
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
this
court
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
1915
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
in
the
war
case
said
that
abandon
mississippi
upon
greek
letter
fraternities
of
the
university
of
mississippi
was
not
unconstitutional
but
there
wasn’t
any
first
amendment
claim
in
that
case.
it
was
is
an
equal
protection
claim
and
a
due
process
claim
and
i
am
not
so
sure
that
there
would
not
be
a
different
--
well,
that
there
could
not
be
a
strong
first
amendment
argument
made
on
behalf
of
greek
letter
fraternities
here
today
compared
to
50
or
60
years
ago
whatever
the
case
was.
but
i
do
not
think
that
the
war
case
really
has
any
bearing
here
because
we
decide
well
before,
the
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
before
this
court
articulated
the
first
amendment
and
its
modern
cause
at
all
and
i
think
there
might
well
be
a
difference
decision
in
war.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
that’s
true
sir,
yes.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
that
has
in
fact
i
think
in
the
argument
to
support
the
forbidding
such
organizations
on
college
campuses.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes
and
it
would
be
easy
although
i
am
not
so
sure
that
you
could
press
that
same
argument
with
respect
to
the
ku
klux
klan
on
a
state-supported
university.
i
think
the
state-supported
university
has
a
first
amendment
duty
to
allow
the
formation
in
our
campus
of
a
chapter
of
a
ku
klux
klan.
but
it
has
the
same
duty
to
continue
to
recognize
a
greek
letter
fraternity
which
discriminates
against
jews,
blacks
and
every
minority
group.
i
do
not
know.
i
am
not
prepared
to
argue
that.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
are
they
greek
letter
social
organization?
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
i
think
there
is
a
distinction
to
be
draw
between
organizations
which
are
political
as
difficult
as
that
might
be
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
that
was
the
argument
we're
here,
of
course
and
unsuccessful
in
1915
and
perhaps
a
successor
would
make
it
equally
unsuccessfully
now.
but
i
think
without
being
able
right
now
to
draw
the
distinctions,
i
think
there
is
an
arguable
distinction
between
a
group
which
is
predominantly
political
like
sds
and
a
group
which
is
predominantly
social.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
ah
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
really
don’t
know
who
would
decide
that.
i
really
don’t
know.
i
think
this
court
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
that
is
and
that’s
why
i
feel
i
am
getting
myself
into
a
thicket
by
trying
to
argue
the
fraternity
case
when
it’s
really
not
the
case
before
us
and
because
there
--
what
i
say
that
that
would
be
argued
differently
here,
the
aclu
might
in
fact
be
the
group
that
would
arguing
it
here
because
there
might
well
be
enough
of
a
associational
right
to
justify
a
very
strong
first
amendment
claim
on
behalf
of
greek
letter
fraternities.
and
although,
i
am
talking
in
terms
of
distinctions,
it
may
be
that
i
might
end
up
believing
there
aren’t
any
viable
distinctions
between
social
and
political
groups.
i
think
the
right
to
associate
in
social
organizations
is
not
less
important
in
the
right
to
associate
in
political
organization.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well
the
petitioners
here,
begging
your
pardon
said
they
didn’t
say
that.
but
if
it
were
a
secret
society,
i
think
that
there
is
probably
some
duty
as
some
initial
duty
which
the
petitioners
here
follow
to
disclose
what
the
purpose
of
the
organization
is.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
and
they
are
seeking
recognition
on
the
college
campus?
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
think,
well,
i
am
really
not
familiar
with
those
secret
societies
on
campus
which
you
referred
to.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
really
can’t
believe
that
they
are
so
secret,
perhaps
you
are
talking
about
skull
and
bones
about
which
i
have
--
i
don’t
know
whether
that
is
one
of
them
or
not.
i
think
yale
has
one
or
two
secret
societies,
but
i
really
can’t
believe
that
the
offices
at
yale
don’t
know
what
those
secret
societies
are
up
to.
i
think
they
have
a
right
to
know.
i
don’t
think
that
a
student
group
has
a
right
to
official
recognition
by
a
college
or
university
unless
they
disclose
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
no,
we
don’t.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
it’s
not
challenged
in
this
case
--
no,
we
don’t.
it’s
not
challenged
in
this
case
and
we
do
not
challenge
the
standards
here.
well,
there
really
weren’t
any
standards
because
that
part
of
the
college
rule
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
don’t
take
the
position
here
that
a
university
has
to
give
blanket
recognition
to
groups
which
want
to
function
as
student
organizations
which
invoke
the
--
which
use
the
name
of
the
college
in
which
they
are
organized.
now,
i
think
there
is
probably
that
minimal
obligation
by
student
groups
or
a
minimal
right
by
the
universities
for
purposes
of
regulation
or
simply
to
know
--
the
regulation
really
is
a
time,
place
and
matter
regulation.
they
have
a
right
to
require
these
student
organizations
to
be
formally
recognized
so
that
they
can
distribute
the
limited
facilities
of
the
university
on
an
equitable
basis.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
no,
in
this
case,
without
recognition,
this
organization
and
according
to
the
respondents,
any
organization
simply
could
not
function
as
an
organization
on
the
campus.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
no,
but
they
simply
could
not
function
in
their
organizational
role
on
the
campus.
they
could
not
meet.
in
fact,
the
record
reflects
a
meeting
that
these
petitioners,
these
very
petitioners
held
after
the
initial
district
court
decision
in
order
to
discuss
what
they
would
do
next
and
they
met
in
a
campus
snack
bar,
and
they
are
immediately
served
with
a
typewritten
notice
by
the
dean
to
disperse
because
they
said
that
they
were
meeting
as
the
formal
sds
group
and
since
they
were
not
recognized,
they
could
not
meet
even
there
in
the
coffee
shop.
so,
denial
here,
they
can
probably
be
members
of
sds
somewhere
else,
but
that
does
not
serve
their
purposes
as
members
of
the
community
if
central
connecticut
state
college.
they
want
to
be
able
to
function
on
the
campus
as
a
group,
use
the
school’s
facility
and
talk
to
their
fellow
student
as
an
organized
political
organization.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
the
only
thing
is
the
record
is
at
the
first
meeting
of
the
student
affairs
committee
in
the
appendix
at
page
95,
one
of
the
questions
is
would
you
seek
funds
from
student
government?
and
the
answer
is
yes.
so
therefore,
i
assume
that
recognized
organizations
are
entitled
to
seek
funds
from
student
government.
but
that
is
all
that
appears
in
the
record.
our
basic
claim
is
that
in
this
case,
there
is
no
reference
at
all
in
the
hearing,
in
the
record
about
these
petitioners.
it
is
all
about
sds.
but
as
these
petitioners
who
are
making
the
claim
to
function
as
a
political
organization
on
this
campus.
we
think
that
the
refusal
on
this
record
or
on
this
record
was
a
prior
restraint
based
entirely
on
a
guilt
by
association,
and
i
must
say
that
the
version
of
the
first
amendment
urged
upon
you
by
the
respondents
and
their
friends
in
court
is
would
be
so
severely
radical
a
departure
from
normal
traditional
standards
of
first
amendment
law
as
articulated
by
this
court
over
the
years
that
i
urge
you
to
reject
their
version.
and,
i
would
like
to
save
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal,
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
would
just
like
to
close
by
saying
that
mr.
ahern’s
arguments
confirms
are
fundamental
claim
that
the
respondent
is
not
arguing
this
case.
it
is
arguing
some
other
case.
there
is
nothing
in
this
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
do
not
think
that
make
any
difference
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
–
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
think
that
they
have
a
minimal
responsibility
to
describe
what
the
purpose
of
their
--
what
purpose
of
the
organization
is.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
if
they
have
made
a
prima
facie
showing
on
their
application
that
they
intent
to
engage
in
protected
political
activity,
they
cannot
add
be
ask
that
question
if
they
don’t
volunteer
it.
if
they
were
asked
here
and
they
did
volunteer
to
answer
it,
but
if
they
refuse
to
answer
to
answer
it,
i
think
that
the
fundamental
first
amendment
know
should
still
require
that
they
granted
recognition
and
that
the
administration
by
the
event
of
any
of
illegal
conduct.
mr.
melvin

wulf
no,
i
think
that
that
was
very
short
hand
way
of
expressing
a
philosophical
view
that
rejects
non-violence.
i
don’t
think
that
it
was
a
reply
that
said
none
of
your
business.
i
mean
it
quite
--
certainly
to
try
to
engage
people
in
the
philosophy
of
violence
in
that
short
hand
kind
of
way
is
never
going
to
be
successful.
but
i
think,
i
disagree
that
it
was
a
response
that
said,
none
of
your
business,
i
think
they
answered
it.
they
certainly
didn’t
say
that
they
did
not
believe
in
violence
and
to
that
extent,
they
are
terribly
candid.
they
said
we
can’t
say
under
some
conditions
that
we
might
not
do
it,
but
that
is
not
ample
reason
under
first
amendment
law
to
prohibit
the
exercise
of
their
first
amendment
rights.
the
state
has
to
wait
and
see.
