justice
potter
stewart
who
are
the
members
of
the
committee,
was
it
a
student
faculty?
justice
potter
stewart
just
student
faculty?
no
members
of
the
administration
as
such?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
--
don’t
know
much
about
the
structure,
organization
structure
of
this
college
or
university,
do
we,
in
the
record?
justice
potter
stewart
central
connecticut
state
college
is
not
a
university
i
guess.
it’s
a
college.
justice
potter
stewart
college.
justice
potter
stewart
where
is
it?
hartford
or
where?
justice
potter
stewart
new
britain
and
it’s
a
wholly
--
wholly
state
support?
justice
potter
stewart
and
well,
this
is
related
to
a
question
i
have
on
my
mind.
there’s
so
much
in
these
briefs
here
in
the
record
bearing
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not,
this
is
or
is
not
a
local
chapter,
a
bona
fide
affiliated
local
chapter
of
the
sds
and
in
your
argument,
does
that
make
any
difference
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don’t
think
so.
but
that
seems
to
be
the
issue
throughout
here.
justice
potter
stewart
your
claim
was
whether
or
not,
or
let’s
just
assume
its
affiliated
with
the
sds.
nonetheless,
it
was
a
violation
of
the
constitutional
rights
of
your
clients
not
to
be
accredited
by
as
a
campus
organization?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
isn’t
that
--
is
that
a
red
herring
to
your
argument
or
isn’t
it?
that’s
what
i
want
to
because
that
seems
to
be
so
much
of
what
the
briefs
devoted
to,
both
briefs.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
it
isn’t.
maybe
it
isn’t
but
i
would
be
sure
i
understand
your
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
what
difference
does
that
make
to
your
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
what
i
thought.
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
--
just
what
first
amendment
rights
are
you
referring
to?
justice
potter
stewart
you
and
it’s
your
submission
that
a
college
university
wants
at
least
that
allows
some
student
organizations
on
the
campus?
justice
potter
stewart
which
is
the
case
here,
we
cannot
bar
any
at
least
short
of
the
hypothetical
situation
that
the
chief
justice
put
to
you
in
his
questions.
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
they
could
not,
college
university
could
say
we
want
no
secret
societies
on
this
campus
or
we
want
no
greek
letter
societies
on
this
campus,
or
we
want
no
societies
that
discriminate
against
jews
on
this
campus,
couldn’t
do
that?
justice
potter
stewart
why?
justice
potter
stewart
why
could
if
you
are
right?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
let’s
say
they
are
political
organizations?
justice
potter
stewart
let’s
say
one
of
the
organizations
is
neo-fascist
organization,
we
want
no
jews.
we
want
only
white
tyrants.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
and
how
about
a
greek
letter
fraternity
that
confines
his
membership
to
white
anglo-saxon
protestant?
justice
potter
stewart
are
all
greek
letter
fraternity?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
it
had.
justice
potter
stewart
not
before
the
first
amendment
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
who
is
to
decide
that?
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
not
for
us
to
decide
--
justice
potter
stewart
if
we
are
political,
then
political?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
secret
societies?
they
just
wouldn’t
say,
just
in
such
hearing
as
you
had
here.
let’s
say,
we’re
sorry.
we
can’t
answer
any
of
your
questions
because
we’re
secret
society?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what
if
they
just
were
against
all
force
and
violence,
but
beyond
that,
we
can’t
tell
you
anything
about
our
purposes
or
our
reason
for
existence
because
we
are
secret
society?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
they
are
and
there
are
many
secret
societies
on
various
campuses
as
you
know.
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
a
secret,
that’s
the
reason
you’re
not.
[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
all
the
greek
letter
fraternities
and
sororities
have
elements
of
secret
societies,
if
i
am
not
mistaken.
justice
potter
stewart
and
many
universities
have
barred
them
from
their
campuses
in
recent
years.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
claim
is
general
that
unless
there
is
campus
recognitions,
there
can’t
be
a
meeting
any
place
on
the
campus
or
any
such
organization
and
appendix
16
and
17
seems
to
support
that
view,
talking
about
the
meeting
of
proposed
meeting
of
november
6,
1969
in
the
devils’
den?
justice
potter
stewart
such
meeting
may
not
quite
to
take
place
in
the
devils’
den
or
the
students’
center
nor
in
or
on
any
other
property
of
the
college
since
the
ccsc-sds
is
not
a
duly
recognized
college
organization?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now
in
their
brief.
in
the
brief
of
the
petitioners,
it
is
alleged
that
official
recognition
is
a
prerequisite
to
meeting
anywhere
on
campus.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
don’t
deny
that,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
to
that
extent
at
least
first
amendment
rights
as
they’re
called
are
implicated,
aren’t
there?
if
in
the
absence
of
official
recognition,
this
group
could
not
meet?
justice
potter
stewart
anywhere
on
the
property
of
the
university
or
the
college?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i'm
--
i
was
just
referring
to
that
particular
meeting
as
seeming
to
confirm
the
general
statement.
i
was
asking
you
about
the
general
statement.
in
the
absence
of
official
recognition,
no
organization
has
any
status.
it’s
just
--
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
campus
of
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
cannot
meet
on
the
property?
justice
potter
stewart
general
ahern.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
the
same
standard
should
apply
to
a
college
university
that
applies
to
a
public
high
school?
you
kept
referring
to
schools,
this
we
have
here
at
college?
justice
potter
stewart
below
the
college
level.
justice
potter
stewart
down
to
a
primary
grade.
justice
potter
stewart
and
do
you
think
in
considering
the
requirements
of
the
protection
of
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments,
there
should
be
a
difference
in
a
college
or
university
which
has
sort
of
a
captive
population
which
is
of
somewhere
in
the
country
with
and
where
all
the
students
leave
on
the
campus
on
one
hand,
a
distinction
could
and
should
be
made
between
that
kind
of
institution
and
an
institution
where
the
students
are
only
at
the
university
for
classes
and
go
home
and
have
plenty
of
places
and
time
available
off
campus
for
whatever
association
or
speech
rights
they
want
to
indulged
in?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
and
the
distinction
would
be
on
campus
or
off
campus
regardless
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
regardless
even
if
you
had
a
situation
where
if
they
wanted
to
organize
at
all.
it
had
to
be
on
campus
because
the
only
thing
off
campus
would
be
woods
and
mountains.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
they
are
campuses
which
as
i
say,
it
was
sort
of
captive
population
where
everybody
lives
on
campus
and
where
there
--
at
by
contrast
with
the
place
like
i
gather
this
college
may
be
in
new
britain,
connecticut
where
many
of
the
students
live
at
home
or
at
least
off
campus,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
you
think
that
you
are
not
suggesting
that
there
should
be
any
flexibility
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
who
are
the
members
of
the
committee,
was
it
