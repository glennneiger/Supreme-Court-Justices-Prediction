mr.
f.
michael
ahern
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
under
the
verbal
assault
of
all
the
high
sounding
rhetoric
of
the
past
several
years
concerning
the
first
amendment
rights
of
student
to
wear
their
hair
long,
to
express
their
political
views
and
to
demonstrate,
i
fear
we
may
well
be
losing
sight
of
the
purpose
of
the
educational
process,
and
i
would
like
restate
it.
the
primary
purpose
of
educational
institutions
at
all
levels,
we
submit,
is
to
provide
the
best
education
possible
to
the
students.
not
to
provide
a
platform
for
the
expression
of
political
views
by
a
few
students.
the
faculty
members
are
hired
to
teach
their
academic
specialties,
not
to
radicalize
and
politicize
the
students.
and
the
students
who
voluntarily
enter
the
educational
community
should
do
so
to
learn
and
not
to
attempt
to
influence
their
fellow
students
to
accept
their
own
political
philosophies.
generally
speaking,
the
vast
majority
of
students
enter
the
college
community
with
an
understanding
that
the
president
and
the
deans
are
in
charge,
and
they
have
the
obligation
to
exercise
their
authority
to
maintain
an
educational
climate
that
is
conducive
to
learning.
indeed,
every
student
is
entitled
to
expect
that
the
administrators
will
so
operate
the
college
that
he
will
give
full
measure,
full
educational
measure
for
every
dollar
of
tuition
expended.
this
means
that
any
disruption
of
classes
or
interference
with
the
educational
process
cannot
be
tolerated
or
condone.
the
campus
strikes
in
disruptions
of
a
last
few
years
which
have
been
led
by
small
minority
of
radical
students
are
to
deplored
because
they
cheated
the
majority
of
students
out
of
the
opportunity
to
attend
classes,
excuse
me,
wasted
the
examination,
preparation
by
the
students
because
the
exams
were
never
held,
and
even
cancelled
or
postponed
commencement
exercises.
and
i
submit
that
at
least
this
situation
was
partly
caused
by
the
college
administrators
refusing
or
being
unwilling
to
exercise
their
authority
to
close
disturbances
at
the
outset.
however,
i
submit
the
administrators
are
not
entirely
to
blame.
the
rush
of
decisions
of
the
federal
courts
following
the
so
called
arrival
of
the
constitution
on
the
campus
has
had
a
chilling
effect
on
the
responsible
administrators.
almost
every
administrative
decision
which
is
made
for
the
purpose
of
securing
order
or
controlling
student
conduct
on
the
campus
is
immediately
challenge
in
the
courts
and
becomes
the
subject
of
an
extensive
and
time
consuming
legal
process
before
it
is
resolved.
this
case
i
submit
exemplifies
the
difficulties
which
college
officials
have
faced
and
continue
to
face
in
attempting
to
administer
the
colleges
throughout
the
country
whenever
the
administrative
decision
is
escalated
into
a
constitutional
issue
and
the
confrontation
between
a
few
students
and
the
authorities.
the
petitioners
in
the
instant
case
have
arrogantly
sought
recognition
of
their
local
chapter
of
students
for
a
democratic
society
on
their
terms.
when
the
president
and
his
deans
refuse
to
exceed
to
those
terms,
the
petitioners
immediately
raised
the
specter
of
interference
with
their
constitutional
rights
of
free
speech
and
free
association
and
sought
the
aid
of
the
federal
courts
to
impose
their
will
on
the
administrators.
the
precise
issue
in
this
case
has
never
been
considered
by
this
court
previously.
that
issue
we
submit
is
whether
the
denial
of
official
campus
recognition
to
the
local
chapter
of
students
for
a
democratic
society
at
central
connecticut
state
college
violated
in
any
way
the
individual
constitutional
rights
of
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
we
submit
that
it
did
not.
without
demeaning
in
the
least
the
importance
of
that
issue,
i
submitted
healy's
to
insignificance
in
the
light
of
the
greater
issue
that
is
involved
here.
that
is
who
shall
govern
the
colleges
of
this
country,
the
students
or
the
college
officials?
as
the
late
justice
black
noted
in
his
dissent
in
tinker,
it
is
nothing
but
wishful
thinking
to
imagine
that
young
immature
students
will
not
soon
believe
that
it
is
their
right
to
control
the
schools.
and
i
think
those
words
were
prophetic.
recognizing
that
there
are
no
legal
presidents
for
their
position,
the
petitioners
here
had
advanced
the
proposition
that
a
college
community
is
somewhat
like
a
municipality
and
should
be
considered
as
such
by
the
court
in
applying
the
protections
of
the
constitution.
if
this
courts
accepts
the
petitioners’
theory,
it
will
mean
that
a
student
entering
an
educational
community
has
an
unfettered
right
to
exercise
his
first
amendment
rights
of
free
speech
and
free
association
on
the
campus.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
excuse
me.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
yes,
i
do
justice
marshall.
does
this
both
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
think
it
could
deny
political
campus
recognition
to
all
political
organizations,
i
don’t
think
they
can
stop
political
organizations.
but,
they
do
not
have
to
grant
official
campus
recognition
to
such
organizations.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
think
that
notice
has
been
misrepresented
to
the
court
if
it
please
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
that’s
correct
justice
stewart.
but
you
did
not
read
the
first
paragraph
of
the
notice
which
says
or
the
memorandum
which
states,
notice
has
been
received
by
this
office
of
a
meeting
of
the
ccsc-sds
on
thursday,
november
6
at
7
o’clock
at
the
devils’
den.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
that
is
all
together
different
than
a
casual
meeting
of
the
group
of
students
to
discuss
the
president’s
denial
of
recognition.
this
is
a
local
chapter
being
called
to
a
meeting,
to
discuss
the
denial
by
president
james
of
recognition
for
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
as
an
organization?
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
that’s
correct.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
no,
i
don’t
your
honor.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
well,
they
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
think,
there’s
a
distinction
justice
stewart
between
the
organization,
meeting
as
an
organization
and
individuals
meeting
together
to
have
discussion,
political
or
otherwise.
this
a
prior,
a
previously
announced
meeting
of
this
local
chapter
of
students
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
that
is
correct.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
it
has
no
status
on
the
campus
of
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
that’s
correct,
as
an
organization.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
that’s
correct.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
you
mean
a
no
action
organization?
that
is
correct
justice
marshall.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
that’s
correct.
for
a
very
simple
reason
by
previously
announcing
the
meeting
of
the
local
chapter
of
sds,
they
not
only
meeting
--
those
people
who
are
interested
in
discussing
this
matter
are
not
only
meeting,
but
they
are
also
notifying
the
7,000
students
on
the
campus
that
there
will
be
an
official
meeting
of
an
organization
which
will
discuss
a
particular
idea.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
well
then,
they
should
seek
official
campus
recognition.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
if
it’s
denied
on
the
basis
that
the
--
they
are
affiliated
with
the
national
organization
that
advocates
violence
and
disruption,
i
think
that
is
a
legitimate
prohibition.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
don’t
think
it’s
a
question
of
the
school
of
not
liking
it.
i
think
it’s
a
question
of
the
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
as
an
organization,
no.
not
in
this
instance
and
the
peculiar
aspects
of
the
college
campus.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
well,
i
question
whether
or
not
the
sds
national
organization
is
basically
a
political
organization.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
pardon
me?
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
they
are
not
a
party
to
this
case,
no.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
there
is
something
in
the
record
concerning
national
sds.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
that’s
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
certainly,
that
opens
up
the
area
of
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
do
not
follow
you.
you
mean
there
is
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
yes.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
because
the
petitioners
have
never
divulged
the
purposes
and
aims
of
the
national
which
they
adopt.
organizations
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
that’s
correct.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
that’s
what
we’re
dealing
with,
but
the
purposes
and
aims
as
they
set
forth
in
their
statement
of
purpose
have
a
different
perspective
when
they
affiliate
themselves
with
the
national
organization.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
no,
we’re
keeping
a
local
chapter
of
the
national
organization
out.
unless
it
determines
and
tells
the
administrators
what
aims
and
purposes
of
the
national
association
they
adopt
for
their
own.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
well
then
how
can
they
organize
a
group
if
they
don’t
know
what
their
aims
and
purposes
of
the?
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
we
are
looking
to
the
present.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
they
told
us
that
they
were
a
local
chapter
of
the
national
sds.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
so
that
i
think
the
president
of
the
college
unreasonably
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
didn’t
follow
that
justice
marshall.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
as
a
local
chapter
of
the
sds,
that
is
correct
on
the
campus.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
no,
i
do
not.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
yes?
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
yes,
sir.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
there
were
two
meetings
of
the
–
you’re
talking
now
of
the
student
affairs
committee.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
there
were
two
meetings.
the
date
on
page
94
i
think
is
incorrect.
i
think
it
was
a
meeting
of
october
2,
1969
at
which
the
initial
application
was
presented
and
petitioner
healy
was
questioned.
that
meeting
was
postponed
until
a
later
time
to
give
the
petitioners
as
i
understand
at
an
opportunity
to
present
a
statement
to
the
committee
as
to
their
affiliation
with
the
national
sds.
at
the
latter
meeting,
a
statement
was
read
into
the
record,
i
believe
stating
that
although
they
call
themselves
a
local
chapter
of
sds,
they
would
not
be
under
the
dictates
or
influence
of
the
national
organization.
they
are
after
the
committee
conditionally
approved
their
application.
we
submit
that
the
petitioners
attempted
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
there
was
a
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
no.
at
the
court
ordered
administrative
hearing.
the
minutes
of
these
meetings
where
introduced
into
the
record
without
objection
by
petitioner
healy
or
counsel
and
petitioner
healy
was
present
at
the
hearing
at
the
time
they
were
introduced.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
made
no
other
statement
and
did
not
object
to
their
introduction
at
that
time
as
i
understand
the
record.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
that
is
correct
justice
white.
we
submit
that
the
petitioners
attempted
treatment
of
this
case
as
a
prior
restraint
case
suspicious.
the
respondents
have
never
restrained
the
individual
petitioners
in
the
exercise
of
their
individual
rights
of
free
speech
or
free
association.
and
the
record
is
devoid
of
any
such
indication.
all
they
have
done
is
to
refuse
to
give
the
administrative
stamp
of
approval
to
the
local
chapter
of
sds
which
we
submit
was
perfectly
proper
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
in
each
of
the
federal
court
cases
in
which
administrative
recognition
was
required
to
be
given
to
the
american
civil
liberties
union
or
a
local
chapter
of
the
american
civil
liberties
union.
that
is
the
radford
college
case
and
the
university
or
southern
mississippi
case,
both
which
are
cited
in
all
of
our
briefs.
the
court
cited
the
aims
and
purposes
of
the
american
civil
liberties
union,
the
national
organization,
in
considering
whether
the
local
chapters
would
be
disrupted
influences
on
the
campus.
so,
we
submitted
was
reasonable
for
dr.
james
to
consider
the
aims
and
purposes
of
the
national
sds
and
reviewing
the
petitioner’s
application
for
a
local
chapter
of
sds
at
central
connecticut
state
college.
the
national
sds
and
its
chapters
in
1968
and
1969
had
instigated
and
participated
in
violence
and
disruption
on
the
campuses
of
the
country
and
caused
millions
of
dollars
of
damage
to
property
and
personal
injuries
to
students,
faculty
and
administrators.
in
the
face
of
that
track
record
of
the
national
sds
movement,
the
petitioners
could
hardly
claim
an
innocuous
purpose.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
these
documents
were
introduced,
no.
these
documents
were
introduced
that
the
court
structure
administrative
hearing
which
was
conducted
by
dean
judd
at
the
or
at
the
order
of
the
district
court
judge,
judge
clarie
so
that
this
documentation
was
not
before
the
student
faculty
committee.
it
didn’t
come
into
the
record
until
the
court
structured
administrative
hearing.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
these
--
initially,
when
this
matter
was
heard
by
the
district
judge,
the
judge
raised
the
ambiguity
which
appeared
on
the
face
of
the
application,
and
sent
the
matter
back
for
an
administrative
hearing
to
clear
up
the
ambiguity.
at
that
administrative
hearing
which
the
court
ordered,
this
documentation
was
submitted
through
the
hearing
officer.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
the
applicants?
one
of
the
applicants
and
one
of
the
petitioners
healy
was
present
at
the
two
administrative
hearings
accompanied
by
legal
counsel.
that
is
correct
justice
burger.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
think
the
student
affairs
committee
meeting
was
on
october
of
1969
and
the
court
structured
administrative
hearing
took
place
the
following
may.
so,
it
would
be
approximately
five
months.
as
this
court
is
aware,
administrative
decisions
are
not
made
in
a
vacuum,
and
we
submit
that
dr.
james
who
had
the
ultimate
responsibility
for
maintaining
a
peaceful
campus
was
also
aware
of
recent
violent
history
of
the
sds
and
very
properly
took
it
into
consideration
in
reaching
his
determination
that
the
local
chapter
of
sds
would
be
a
harmful
presence
on
the
campus.
at
the
court
ordered
administrative
hearing
which
was
intended
by
the
court
to
allow
petitioners
to
present
evidence
to
resolve
the
ambiguity
in
their
application,
the
petitioners
consistently
refused
on
advised
of
counsel
to
contribute
anything
constructive
to
the
record,
except
the
statement
that
the
local
chapter
would
not
be
affiliated
with
the
structure
of
the
national
sds.
the
statement
did
not
contain
those
aims
and
purposes
of
that
national
sds
which
the
local
chapter
adopted
as
their
own
in
order
to
contain
the
statement
disavowing
the
violent
and
disruptive
tactics
of
the
national
organization.
in
order
to
contain
the
statement
at
the
local
chapter
would
not
disrupt
the
campus
or
engage
in
violence.
on
the
other
hand,
the
material
submitted
by
the
administration
substantiated
the
fact
that
under
the
national
constitution
of
the
sds,
the
national
organization
controls
the
chapters.
also
reproductions
of
local
and
national
members
of
ship
cards
clearly
evidence,
they
continuing
relationship
between
local
and
national
offices
and
also
indicated
joint
membership
record
keeping
systems.
in
that
connection,
i
made
reference
on
my
brief
and
i
like
to
do
so
orally
here
to
the
fact
that
in
printing
the
single
appendix,
a
one-page
exhibit
hearing
offices
exhibit
“g”
has
been
spread
over
three
pages
in
the
appendix,
and
also
the
overprint
on
the
membership
applications
indicating
which
portion
of
the
dual
application
form
was
for
national
office
records
and
which
portion
was
for
local
chapter
records
has
been
deleted
so
that
the
effect
of
that
exhibit
is
lost
in
its
printing
in
the
appendix.
i
would
therefore
urge
the
court
to
look
at
the
original
exhibit
in
order
to
that
the
respondent’s
purpose
in
submitting
it
in
evidence
can
be
deduced,
or
if
the
court
would
like,
i
will
make
reproductions
for
the
use
of
the
court.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
a
copy
was
given
to
mr.
wulf
at
the
time
the
single
appendix
was
printed,
your
honor,
chief
justice.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
justice
white,
i
don’t
think
a
college
president
is
required
to
buy
picking
a
paw?
i
think
he
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
if
they
don’t
simply
state
to
the
administrator
just
about
their
aims
and
purposes
are,
and
if
they
are
affiliated
with
an
organization
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
think
they
can
be
denied
campus
recognition.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
yes,
i
do
justice
white.
the
dissent
below
cites
several
cases
indicating
that
the
clear
and
present
danger
rule
should
be
applied
in
this
case.
but
we
submit
that
the
analysis
of
the
case
and
the
issue
in
the
by
the
dissent
below
is
erroneous.
those
cases
cited
by
the
decent
dealt
with
the
citizen’s
relationship
to
society
at
large,
while
here,
we
are
dealing
with
the
student’s
relationship
and
a
voluntary
community
composed
of
students,
faculty
and
administrators.
the
administrators,
pardon
me,
the
petitioners
advanced
the
proposition
in
their
brief
that
this
case
gives
the
court
the
opportunity
to
implant
the
first
amendment
firmly
on
the
college
campus.
we
submit
that
the
constitution
has
already
been
firmly
entrenched
on
the
college
campus,
and
a
few
radical
students
have
used
it
or
rather
abused
it
to
spread
violence
and
disruption.
what
is
needed
is
more
responsible
administrative
leadership
on
the
campus.
not
further
restriction
of
administrative
authority
in
the
name
of
constitutional
freedom.
as
we
stated
previously,
what
has
caused
the
problems
on
the
campuses
in
prior
years,
we
submit
has
been
a
failure
of
the
authorities
to
govern.
it
would
be
in
deed
ironic
if
in
the
name
of
the
petitioners
alleged
right
to
administrative
support
of
their
so
called
political
programs,
this
court
would
announce
a
rule
that
deprive
school
officials
with
backbone
to
face
up
to
their
responsibilities
as
the
respondents
in
this
case
of
any
power
to
govern
their
institutions.
this
court
would
be
upholding
the
attack
by
a
few
on
the
rights
of
academic
freedom
of
the
vast
majority
of
student.
for
without
the
power
to
prohibit
a
campus
organization
which
he
reasonably
believes
to
be
harmful
to
the
academic
climate
of
this
college,
the
college
president
might
as
well
resign.
he
would
have
no
authority
in
the
one
area
where
it
really
counts,
that
is
upholding
the
moral
integrity
of
the
school.
lacking
the
essential
governing
power,
he
would
lack
the
authority
to
protect
the
majority
of
students
on
the
campus.
and
lacking
such
support
of
the
administration,
those
students
would
have
no
means
say
cumbersome
and
expensive
legal
process
to
ensure
their
personal
academic
freedom.
so,
we
submit
that
does
in
the
name
of
freedom
for
the
few,
would
be
freedom
of
all
be
compromised?
i
submit
that
the
court
should
reemphasize
and
restate
a
non-equivocal
terms
the
authority
of
the
school
administrators
to
prescribe
and
control
conduct
in
the
schools.
and
that
although
the
students
do
not
leave
their
constitutional
rights
at
the
door,
those
rights
maybe
curtailed
and
restricted
by
rules,
reasonable
rules
and
regulations.
a
judge
in
a
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
texas
recently
phrased
it
very
concisely
in
the
case
of
egner
v.
texas
city
independent
school
district
reported
in
40
u.s.
law
2556,
the
february
2972
edition,
and
i
quote
from
it.
“to
the
extent
that
such
routine
conflicts
become
the
subject
of
frequent
constitutional
adjudication
in
the
lower
federal
courts,
it
is
inevitable
that
a
monolithic
and
stultifying
national
uniformity
will
be
judicially
imposed
in
the
name
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
since
the
general
terms
of
the
amendment
contained
no
concrete
standards
of
decision
for
the
great
majority
of
such
suits,
it
is
predictable
that
the
federal
common
law
of
school
discipline
which
would
develop
will
reflect
nothing
more
than
the
amalgam
of
the
educational
views
of
diverse
federal
judges.
most
of
whom
are
suited
to
the
task
by
neither
disposition
nor
competence.”
it
is
in
this
spirit
that
we
ask
the
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
below.
thank
you.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
excuse
me.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
well,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
tinker
case
decided
by
this
court
reached
down
i
think
one
of
the
tinker
boys
is
eight
years
old.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
right.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
a
college
student
has
more
perspicacity
than
an
eight
year
old
in
a
grammar
school,
and
as
the
might
the
petitioners
stated
in
their
brief,
the
recent
court,
the
recent
decision
of
this
court
in
tilton
indicates
that
college
students
are
more
mature
and
more
able
to
determine
what
is
good
for
them.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
don’t
think
that
would
be
a
basis
for
distinction.
i
think
the
distinction
as
to
on
the
basis
of
age
which
is
more
desirable.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
off
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
well,
the
school
administrators
have
no
control
of
the
students
off
the
campus.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
that
is
correct
justice
stewart.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
oh,
when
you
say
there,
i
am
not
suggesting
any
flexibility.
i
think
the
college
has
to
make
the
reasonable
rules
and
regulations
as
to
activities
on
the
campus,
whether
the
students
are
living
on
the
campus
or
whether
they
are
day
house
and
come
on
the
campus
during
the
day.
but
their
activities
on
the
campus
should
be
the
subject
of
reasonable
rules
and
regulations.
otherwise,
you
have
chaos
in
the
campus.
so
that
i
think
as
far
as
the
first
amendment
rights
of
students
are
concern,
i
think
the
administration
should
be
allowed
to
make
reasonable
rules
and
regulations
so
as
to
ensure
order
on
the
campus
and
the
orderly
process
of
educating
the
students
without
interference
by
everyone
who
feels
that
they
want
to
make
a
speech.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
don’t
see
how
we
could
stop
it.
they’re
not
using
the
campus
for
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
at
this
point,
it’s
off
campus.
it
is
also
allows
women
in
the
bar.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
thank
you.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
under
the
verbal
assault
of
all
the
high
sounding
rhetoric
of
the
past
several
years
concerning
the
first
amendment
rights
of
student
to
wear
their
hair
long,
to
express
their
political
views
and
to
demonstrate,
i
fear
we
may
well
be
losing
sight
of
the
purpose
of
the
educational
process,
and
i
would
like
restate
it.
the
primary
purpose
of
educational
institutions
at
all
levels,
we
submit,
is
to
provide
the
best
education
possible
to
the
students.
not
to
provide
a
platform
for
the
expression
of
political
views
by
a
few
students.
the
faculty
members
are
hired
to
teach
their
academic
specialties,
not
to
radicalize
and
politicize
the
students.
and
the
students
who
voluntarily
enter
the
educational
community
should
do
so
to
learn
and
not
to
attempt
to
influence
their
fellow
students
to
accept
their
own
political
philosophies.
generally
speaking,
the
vast
majority
of
students
enter
the
college
community
with
an
understanding
that
the
president
and
the
deans
are
in
charge,
and
they
have
the
obligation
to
exercise
their
authority
to
maintain
an
educational
climate
that
is
conducive
to
learning.
indeed,
every
student
is
entitled
to
expect
that
the
administrators
will
so
operate
the
college
that
he
will
give
full
measure,
full
educational
measure
for
every
dollar
of
tuition
expended.
this
means
that
any
disruption
of
classes
or
interference
with
the
educational
process
cannot
be
tolerated
or
condone.
the
campus
strikes
in
disruptions
of
a
last
few
years
which
have
been
led
by
small
minority
of
radical
students
are
to
deplored
because
they
cheated
the
majority
of
students
out
of
the
opportunity
to
attend
classes,
excuse
me,
wasted
the
examination,
preparation
by
the
students
because
the
exams
were
never
held,
and
even
cancelled
or
postponed
commencement
exercises.
and
i
submit
that
at
least
this
situation
was
partly
caused
by
the
college
administrators
refusing
or
being
unwilling
to
exercise
their
authority
to
close
disturbances
at
the
outset.
however,
i
submit
the
administrators
are
not
entirely
to
blame.
the
rush
of
decisions
of
the
federal
courts
following
the
so
called
arrival
of
the
constitution
on
the
campus
has
had
a
chilling
effect
on
the
responsible
administrators.
almost
every
administrative
decision
which
is
made
for
the
purpose
of
securing
order
or
controlling
student
conduct
on
the
campus
is
immediately
challenge
in
the
courts
and
becomes
the
subject
of
an
extensive
and
time
consuming
legal
process
before
it
is
resolved.
this
case
i
submit
exemplifies
the
difficulties
which
college
officials
have
faced
and
continue
to
face
in
attempting
to
administer
the
colleges
throughout
the
country
whenever
the
administrative
decision
is
escalated
into
a
constitutional
issue
and
the
confrontation
between
a
few
students
and
the
authorities.
the
petitioners
in
the
instant
case
have
arrogantly
sought
recognition
of
their
local
chapter
of
students
for
a
democratic
society
on
their
terms.
when
the
president
and
his
deans
refuse
to
exceed
to
those
terms,
the
petitioners
immediately
raised
the
specter
of
interference
with
their
constitutional
rights
of
free
speech
and
free
association
and
sought
the
aid
of
the
federal
courts
to
impose
their
will
on
the
administrators.
the
precise
issue
in
this
case
has
never
been
considered
by
this
court
previously.
that
issue
we
submit
is
whether
the
denial
of
official
campus
recognition
to
the
local
chapter
of
students
for
a
democratic
society
at
central
connecticut
state
college
violated
in
any
way
the
individual
constitutional
rights
of
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
we
submit
that
it
did
not.
without
demeaning
in
the
least
the
importance
of
that
issue,
i
submitted
healy's
to
insignificance
in
the
light
of
the
greater
issue
that
is
involved
here.
that
is
who
shall
govern
the
colleges
of
this
country,
the
students
or
the
college
officials?
as
the
late
justice
black
noted
in
his
dissent
in
tinker,
it
is
nothing
but
wishful
thinking
to
imagine
that
young
immature
students
will
not
soon
believe
that
it
is
their
right
to
control
the
schools.
and
i
think
those
words
were
prophetic.
recognizing
that
there
are
no
legal
presidents
for
their
position,
the
petitioners
here
had
advanced
the
proposition
that
a
college
community
is
somewhat
like
a
municipality
and
should
be
considered
as
such
by
the
court
in
applying
the
protections
of
the
constitution.
if
this
courts
accepts
the
petitioners’
theory,
it
will
mean
that
a
student
entering
an
educational
community
has
an
unfettered
right
to
exercise
his
first
amendment
rights
of
free
speech
and
free
association
on
the
campus.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
excuse
me.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
yes,
i
do
justice
marshall.
does
this
both
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
think
it
could
deny
political
campus
recognition
to
all
political
organizations,
i
don’t
think
they
can
stop
political
organizations.
but,
they
do
not
have
to
grant
official
campus
recognition
to
such
organizations.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
think
that
notice
has
been
misrepresented
to
the
court
if
it
please
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
that’s
correct
justice
stewart.
but
you
did
not
read
the
first
paragraph
of
the
notice
which
says
or
the
memorandum
which
states,
notice
has
been
received
by
this
office
of
a
meeting
of
the
ccsc-sds
on
thursday,
november
6
at
7
o’clock
at
the
devils’
den.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
that
is
all
together
different
than
a
casual
meeting
of
the
group
of
students
to
discuss
the
president’s
denial
of
recognition.
this
is
a
local
chapter
being
called
to
a
meeting,
to
discuss
the
denial
by
president
james
of
recognition
for
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
as
an
organization?
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
that’s
correct.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
no,
i
don’t
your
honor.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
well,
they
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
think,
there’s
a
distinction
justice
stewart
between
the
organization,
meeting
as
an
organization
and
individuals
meeting
together
to
have
discussion,
political
or
otherwise.
this
a
prior,
a
previously
announced
meeting
of
this
local
chapter
of
students
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
that
is
correct.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
it
has
no
status
on
the
campus
of
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
that’s
correct,
as
an
organization.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
that’s
correct.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
you
mean
a
no
action
organization?
that
is
correct
justice
marshall.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
that’s
correct.
for
a
very
simple
reason
by
previously
announcing
the
meeting
of
the
local
chapter
of
sds,
they
not
only
meeting
--
those
people
who
are
interested
in
discussing
this
matter
are
not
only
meeting,
but
they
are
also
notifying
the
7,000
students
on
the
campus
that
there
will
be
an
official
meeting
of
an
organization
which
will
discuss
a
particular
idea.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
well
then,
they
should
seek
official
campus
recognition.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
if
it’s
denied
on
the
basis
that
the
--
they
are
affiliated
with
the
national
organization
that
advocates
violence
and
disruption,
i
think
that
is
a
legitimate
prohibition.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
don’t
think
it’s
a
question
of
the
school
of
not
liking
it.
i
think
it’s
a
question
of
the
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
as
an
organization,
no.
not
in
this
instance
and
the
peculiar
aspects
of
the
college
campus.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
well,
i
question
whether
or
not
the
sds
national
organization
is
basically
a
political
organization.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
pardon
me?
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
they
are
not
a
party
to
this
case,
no.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
there
is
something
in
the
record
concerning
national
sds.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
that’s
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
certainly,
that
opens
up
the
area
of
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
do
not
follow
you.
you
mean
there
is
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
yes.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
because
the
petitioners
have
never
divulged
the
purposes
and
aims
of
the
national
which
they
adopt.
organizations
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
that’s
correct.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
that’s
what
we’re
dealing
with,
but
the
purposes
and
aims
as
they
set
forth
in
their
statement
of
purpose
have
a
different
perspective
when
they
affiliate
themselves
with
the
national
organization.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
no,
we’re
keeping
a
local
chapter
of
the
national
organization
out.
unless
it
determines
and
tells
the
administrators
what
aims
and
purposes
of
the
national
association
they
adopt
for
their
own.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
well
then
how
can
they
organize
a
group
if
they
don’t
know
what
their
aims
and
purposes
of
the?
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
we
are
looking
to
the
present.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
they
told
us
that
they
were
a
local
chapter
of
the
national
sds.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
so
that
i
think
the
president
of
the
college
unreasonably
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
didn’t
follow
that
justice
marshall.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
as
a
local
chapter
of
the
sds,
that
is
correct
on
the
campus.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
no,
i
do
not.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
yes?
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
yes,
sir.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
there
were
two
meetings
of
the
–
you’re
talking
now
of
the
student
affairs
committee.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
there
were
two
meetings.
the
date
on
page
94
i
think
is
incorrect.
i
think
it
was
a
meeting
of
october
2,
1969
at
which
the
initial
application
was
presented
and
petitioner
healy
was
questioned.
that
meeting
was
postponed
until
a
later
time
to
give
the
petitioners
as
i
understand
at
an
opportunity
to
present
a
statement
to
the
committee
as
to
their
affiliation
with
the
national
sds.
at
the
latter
meeting,
a
statement
was
read
into
the
record,
i
believe
stating
that
although
they
call
themselves
a
local
chapter
of
sds,
they
would
not
be
under
the
dictates
or
influence
of
the
national
organization.
they
are
after
the
committee
conditionally
approved
their
application.
we
submit
that
the
petitioners
attempted
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
there
was
a
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
no.
at
the
court
ordered
administrative
hearing.
the
minutes
of
these
meetings
where
introduced
into
the
record
without
objection
by
petitioner
healy
or
counsel
and
petitioner
healy
was
present
at
the
hearing
at
the
time
they
were
introduced.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
made
no
other
statement
and
did
not
object
to
their
introduction
at
that
time
as
i
understand
the
record.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
that
is
correct
justice
white.
we
submit
that
the
petitioners
attempted
treatment
of
this
case
as
a
prior
restraint
case
suspicious.
the
respondents
have
never
restrained
the
individual
petitioners
in
the
exercise
of
their
individual
rights
of
free
speech
or
free
association.
and
the
record
is
devoid
of
any
such
indication.
all
they
have
done
is
to
refuse
to
give
the
administrative
stamp
of
approval
to
the
local
chapter
of
sds
which
we
submit
was
perfectly
proper
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
in
each
of
the
federal
court
cases
in
which
administrative
recognition
was
required
to
be
given
to
the
american
civil
liberties
union
or
a
local
chapter
of
the
american
civil
liberties
union.
that
is
the
radford
college
case
and
the
university
or
southern
mississippi
case,
both
which
are
cited
in
all
of
our
briefs.
the
court
cited
the
aims
and
purposes
of
the
american
civil
liberties
union,
the
national
organization,
in
considering
whether
the
local
chapters
would
be
disrupted
influences
on
the
campus.
so,
we
submitted
was
reasonable
for
dr.
james
to
consider
the
aims
and
purposes
of
the
national
sds
and
reviewing
the
petitioner’s
application
for
a
local
chapter
of
sds
at
central
connecticut
state
college.
the
national
sds
and
its
chapters
in
1968
and
1969
had
instigated
and
participated
in
violence
and
disruption
on
the
campuses
of
the
country
and
caused
millions
of
dollars
of
damage
to
property
and
personal
injuries
to
students,
faculty
and
administrators.
in
the
face
of
that
track
record
of
the
national
sds
movement,
the
petitioners
could
hardly
claim
an
innocuous
purpose.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
these
documents
were
introduced,
no.
these
documents
were
introduced
that
the
court
structure
administrative
hearing
which
was
conducted
by
dean
judd
at
the
or
at
the
order
of
the
district
court
judge,
judge
clarie
so
that
this
documentation
was
not
before
the
student
faculty
committee.
it
didn’t
come
into
the
record
until
the
court
structured
administrative
hearing.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
these
--
initially,
when
this
matter
was
heard
by
the
district
judge,
the
judge
raised
the
ambiguity
which
appeared
on
the
face
of
the
application,
and
sent
the
matter
back
for
an
administrative
hearing
to
clear
up
the
ambiguity.
at
that
administrative
hearing
which
the
court
ordered,
this
documentation
was
submitted
through
the
hearing
officer.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
the
applicants?
one
of
the
applicants
and
one
of
the
petitioners
healy
was
present
at
the
two
administrative
hearings
accompanied
by
legal
counsel.
that
is
correct
justice
burger.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
think
the
student
affairs
committee
meeting
was
on
october
of
1969
and
the
court
structured
administrative
hearing
took
place
the
following
may.
so,
it
would
be
approximately
five
months.
as
this
court
is
aware,
administrative
decisions
are
not
made
in
a
vacuum,
and
we
submit
that
dr.
james
who
had
the
ultimate
responsibility
for
maintaining
a
peaceful
campus
was
also
aware
of
recent
violent
history
of
the
sds
and
very
properly
took
it
into
consideration
in
reaching
his
determination
that
the
local
chapter
of
sds
would
be
a
harmful
presence
on
the
campus.
at
the
court
ordered
administrative
hearing
which
was
intended
by
the
court
to
allow
petitioners
to
present
evidence
to
resolve
the
ambiguity
in
their
application,
the
petitioners
consistently
refused
on
advised
of
counsel
to
contribute
anything
constructive
to
the
record,
except
the
statement
that
the
local
chapter
would
not
be
affiliated
with
the
structure
of
the
national
sds.
the
statement
did
not
contain
those
aims
and
purposes
of
that
national
sds
which
the
local
chapter
adopted
as
their
own
in
order
to
contain
the
statement
disavowing
the
violent
and
disruptive
tactics
of
the
national
organization.
in
order
to
contain
the
statement
at
the
local
chapter
would
not
disrupt
the
campus
or
engage
in
violence.
on
the
other
hand,
the
material
submitted
by
the
administration
substantiated
the
fact
that
under
the
national
constitution
of
the
sds,
the
national
organization
controls
the
chapters.
also
reproductions
of
local
and
national
members
of
ship
cards
clearly
evidence,
they
continuing
relationship
between
local
and
national
offices
and
also
indicated
joint
membership
record
keeping
systems.
in
that
connection,
i
made
reference
on
my
brief
and
i
like
to
do
so
orally
here
to
the
fact
that
in
printing
the
single
appendix,
a
one-page
exhibit
hearing
offices
exhibit
“g”
has
been
spread
over
three
pages
in
the
appendix,
and
also
the
overprint
on
the
membership
applications
indicating
which
portion
of
the
dual
application
form
was
for
national
office
records
and
which
portion
was
for
local
chapter
records
has
been
deleted
so
that
the
effect
of
that
exhibit
is
lost
in
its
printing
in
the
appendix.
i
would
therefore
urge
the
court
to
look
at
the
original
exhibit
in
order
to
that
the
respondent’s
purpose
in
submitting
it
in
evidence
can
be
deduced,
or
if
the
court
would
like,
i
will
make
reproductions
for
the
use
of
the
court.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
a
copy
was
given
to
mr.
wulf
at
the
time
the
single
appendix
was
printed,
your
honor,
chief
justice.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
justice
white,
i
don’t
think
a
college
president
is
required
to
buy
picking
a
paw?
i
think
he
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
if
they
don’t
simply
state
to
the
administrator
just
about
their
aims
and
purposes
are,
and
if
they
are
affiliated
with
an
organization
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
think
they
can
be
denied
campus
recognition.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
yes,
i
do
justice
white.
the
dissent
below
cites
several
cases
indicating
that
the
clear
and
present
danger
rule
should
be
applied
in
this
case.
but
we
submit
that
the
analysis
of
the
case
and
the
issue
in
the
by
the
dissent
below
is
erroneous.
those
cases
cited
by
the
decent
dealt
with
the
citizen’s
relationship
to
society
at
large,
while
here,
we
are
dealing
with
the
student’s
relationship
and
a
voluntary
community
composed
of
students,
faculty
and
administrators.
the
administrators,
pardon
me,
the
petitioners
advanced
the
proposition
in
their
brief
that
this
case
gives
the
court
the
opportunity
to
implant
the
first
amendment
firmly
on
the
college
campus.
we
submit
that
the
constitution
has
already
been
firmly
entrenched
on
the
college
campus,
and
a
few
radical
students
have
used
it
or
rather
abused
it
to
spread
violence
and
disruption.
what
is
needed
is
more
responsible
administrative
leadership
on
the
campus.
not
further
restriction
of
administrative
authority
in
the
name
of
constitutional
freedom.
as
we
stated
previously,
what
has
caused
the
problems
on
the
campuses
in
prior
years,
we
submit
has
been
a
failure
of
the
authorities
to
govern.
it
would
be
in
deed
ironic
if
in
the
name
of
the
petitioners
alleged
right
to
administrative
support
of
their
so
called
political
programs,
this
court
would
announce
a
rule
that
deprive
school
officials
with
backbone
to
face
up
to
their
responsibilities
as
the
respondents
in
this
case
of
any
power
to
govern
their
institutions.
this
court
would
be
upholding
the
attack
by
a
few
on
the
rights
of
academic
freedom
of
the
vast
majority
of
student.
for
without
the
power
to
prohibit
a
campus
organization
which
he
reasonably
believes
to
be
harmful
to
the
academic
climate
of
this
college,
the
college
president
might
as
well
resign.
he
would
have
no
authority
in
the
one
area
where
it
really
counts,
that
is
upholding
the
moral
integrity
of
the
school.
lacking
the
essential
governing
power,
he
would
lack
the
authority
to
protect
the
majority
of
students
on
the
campus.
and
lacking
such
support
of
the
administration,
those
students
would
have
no
means
say
cumbersome
and
expensive
legal
process
to
ensure
their
personal
academic
freedom.
so,
we
submit
that
does
in
the
name
of
freedom
for
the
few,
would
be
freedom
of
all
be
compromised?
i
submit
that
the
court
should
reemphasize
and
restate
a
non-equivocal
terms
the
authority
of
the
school
administrators
to
prescribe
and
control
conduct
in
the
schools.
and
that
although
the
students
do
not
leave
their
constitutional
rights
at
the
door,
those
rights
maybe
curtailed
and
restricted
by
rules,
reasonable
rules
and
regulations.
a
judge
in
a
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
texas
recently
phrased
it
very
concisely
in
the
case
of
egner
v.
texas
city
independent
school
district
reported
in
40
u.s.
law
2556,
the
february
2972
edition,
and
i
quote
from
it.
“to
the
extent
that
such
routine
conflicts
become
the
subject
of
frequent
constitutional
adjudication
in
the
lower
federal
courts,
it
is
inevitable
that
a
monolithic
and
stultifying
national
uniformity
will
be
judicially
imposed
in
the
name
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
since
the
general
terms
of
the
amendment
contained
no
concrete
standards
of
decision
for
the
great
majority
of
such
suits,
it
is
predictable
that
the
federal
common
law
of
school
discipline
which
would
develop
will
reflect
nothing
more
than
the
amalgam
of
the
educational
views
of
diverse
federal
judges.
most
of
whom
are
suited
to
the
task
by
neither
disposition
nor
competence.”
it
is
in
this
spirit
that
we
ask
the
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
below.
thank
you.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
excuse
me.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
well,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
tinker
case
decided
by
this
court
reached
down
i
think
one
of
the
tinker
boys
is
eight
years
old.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
right.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
a
college
student
has
more
perspicacity
than
an
eight
year
old
in
a
grammar
school,
and
as
the
might
the
petitioners
stated
in
their
brief,
the
recent
court,
the
recent
decision
of
this
court
in
tilton
indicates
that
college
students
are
more
mature
and
more
able
to
determine
what
is
good
for
them.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
don’t
think
that
would
be
a
basis
for
distinction.
i
think
the
distinction
as
to
on
the
basis
of
age
which
is
more
desirable.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
off
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
well,
the
school
administrators
have
no
control
of
the
students
off
the
campus.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
that
is
correct
justice
stewart.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
oh,
when
you
say
there,
i
am
not
suggesting
any
flexibility.
i
think
the
college
has
to
make
the
reasonable
rules
and
regulations
as
to
activities
on
the
campus,
whether
the
students
are
living
on
the
campus
or
whether
they
are
day
house
and
come
on
the
campus
during
the
day.
but
their
activities
on
the
campus
should
be
the
subject
of
reasonable
rules
and
regulations.
otherwise,
you
have
chaos
in
the
campus.
so
that
i
think
as
far
as
the
first
amendment
rights
of
students
are
concern,
i
think
the
administration
should
be
allowed
to
make
reasonable
rules
and
regulations
so
as
to
ensure
order
on
the
campus
and
the
orderly
process
of
educating
the
students
without
interference
by
everyone
who
feels
that
they
want
to
make
a
speech.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
don’t
see
how
we
could
stop
it.
they’re
not
using
the
campus
for
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
at
this
point,
it’s
off
campus.
it
is
also
allows
women
in
the
bar.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
thank
you.
