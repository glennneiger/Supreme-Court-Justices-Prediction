justice

white
well,
i
take
it
even
if
the
two
issues
you
want
to
add,
couldn't
be
added,
now
if
the
secretary
ran
a
new
election,
he
would
still
have
to
run
a
legal
election.
and
if
the
situations
you
claimed
just
as
in
prior
election,
that
actually
existed
is
not
supposed
to
exist
in
the
new
one,
if
it
was
a
legal?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
can’t
be
litigated.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
just
a
remedy?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
i
am
just
wondering
if
there
is
anything,
no
action
would
suffice
which
could
be
pendent
in
this
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor
general,
suppose
that
we
disagreed
with
you
that
rule
24(a)
was
irrelevant
in
this
case,
but
agreed
with
you
that
the
secretary
is
the
only
one
who
can
bring
the
action,
he
is
the
only
one
who
can
specify
the
issues,
but
nevertheless
in
trying
out
those
issues
that
he
controlled.
24(a)
should
have
its
normal
operation.
would
intervention
then
under
24(a)
be
justified
on
normal
grounds?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
who
decides
the
issues?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
as
i
read
the
opinion
below,
they
did
not
consider
24(a)
on
its
own
footing,
except
with
respect
to
the
financial
records
and
reports
issue.
as
with
respect
to
the
other
part
of
the
case,
they
just
said
24(a)
was
irrelevant
in
the
sense
that
the
waiver
statute
itself
precluded
application
of
24(a).
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
court
decided
that;
that
was
error,
i
suppose
24(a)
should
be
considered,
i
suppose
the
court
of
appeals
should
consider
it
first.
then
entirely
upon
the
nature
of
the
remand
which
this
court
made;
if
this
court
remanded
it
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
consider,
i
assume
they
would
consider.
