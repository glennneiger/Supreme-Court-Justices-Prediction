mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
i
begin,
i
would
like
to
call
attention
to
the
brief
which
we
have
filed
in
this
case.
for
the
first
time
and
literally
thousands
of
these
briefs
that
i've
seen,
the
table
of
contents
and
the
table
of
cases
is
at
the
end
and
instead
of
at
the
beginning.
i
don't
have
any
idea
why
it
happened.
the
government
printing
office
has
printed
these
for
50-75
years.
as
you
will
recall
the
case
is
here
on
an
expedited
schedule
and
when
i
found
this
out
on
monday,
i
decided
that
we
would
simply
leave
it
as
it
as
and
not
try
to
incur
overtime
and
what
not
and
have
it
reprinted.
i've
already
found
that
something
of
an
inconvenience
myself
because
naturally
you
turn
to
the
front
and
i
say
i'm
sorry
but
that's
what
happened
and
there
are
some
things
even
a
solicitor
general
can’t
control.
the
case
here
turns
on
the
construction
of
a
statute
i
believe
which
is
illuminated
by
the
legislative
history.
i
do
not
think
that
i
can
demonstrate
by
logic
like
that
involved
in
the
binomial
theorem,
that
the
result
for
which
i
contend
is
inevitable.
i
do
think
or
hope
that
i
can
make
about
a
stronger
case
on
legislative
history,
as
i
can
imagine
short
of
demonstration
which
i
think
should
lead
the
court
to
the
conclusion,
that
the
statutory
provision
should
be
construed
to
prevent
intervention
in
this
case.
let
me
look
first
at
the
language
of
the
statute
to
which
not
much
attention
has
been
paid
in
the
argument
so
far.
and
i'm
referring
now
to
the
brief
of
the
united
mine
workers,
the
blue
covered
brief
which
has
the
statute's
most
comprehensively
in
the
appendix
at
the
end.
let
me
say
also
by
a
way
of
opening
that
in
this
trial
which
is
now
going
on,
the
work
for
the
moment
is
in
recess
in
the
district
court.
the
secretary
is
vigorously
opposing
the
united
mine
workers.
on
this
particular
aspect
of
it,
relating
to
intervention,
the
secretary
and
united
mine
workers
are
on
the
same
side,
the
united
mine
workers
have
yielded
the
time
which
they
could
have
had
in
this
oral
argument
to
me
because
they
share
our
view
that
this
is
a
suit
and
the
district
court
which
is
and
ought
to
be
in
the
control
of
the
secretary
but
mr.
coomes
(ph)
here
is
representing
the
united
mine
worker.
now
section
402.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice,
i'm
understand
that
he
is
going
ahead
on
the
basis
of
his
decision
and
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
the
case
come
to
a
conclusion
before
you
decide
it,
i
don't
know
what
would
happen.
i
assume
that
if
you
should
decide
that
intervention
is
allowed
that
he
would
then
reopen
the
record
and
allow
the
presentation
of
the
material
which
mr.
rauh
once
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
he
wants
to,
i
assume,
but
he
would
i
suppose
be
entitled
to
recall
witnesses
for
cross
examination
and
other
items
of
that
kind.
all
of
this
i
should
take
was
within
the
control
of
the
trial
judge
and
i
have
not
heard
any
suggestion
that
it
is
not
a
matter
which
can
be
worked
out.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
certainly,
no
jury
involved,
and
certainly
if
the
court's
decision
is
adverse
to
our
position,
the
secretary
will
cooperate
and
trying
to
put
the
court's
decision
into
practical
effect.
section
402
of
the
statute
which
is
the
labor-management
reporting
and
disclosure
act
of
1959,
quite
a
landmark
in
our
labor
relations
law,
section
402
begins
on
page
5a
of
the
appendix
to
the
brief,
and
it
says,
that
a
member
of
a
labor
organization
who
has
exhausted
his
remedies
in
the
union,
and
who
has
invoked
his
available
remedies
without
obtaining
a
final
decision
within
three
calender
months,
may
file
a
complaint
with
the
secretary
under
section
481.
and
section
481
sets
out
in
considerable
details,
standard
for
the
conduct
of
elections.
402
(b)
provides
that
the
secretary
shall
investigate
and
if
he
finds
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
violation
has
occurred,
he
should
bring
a
civil
action
against
the
labor
organization
in
the
district
court
of
the
united
states.
and
then
section
402
(c)
provides
that
if
upon
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
after
trial
on
the
merits,
the
court
plans
that
an
election
has
not
been
held
within
the
time
prescribed
by
section
481
or
482,
that
the
violation
of
section
481
of
this
title
may
have
affected
the
outcome
of
an
election.
the
court
shall
declare
the
election,
if
any
to
be
void,
and
direct
the
conduct
of
a
new
election
under
supervision
of
the
secretary,
and
so
far
as
lawful
and
practicable
in
conformity
with
the
constitution
and
bylaws
of
the
labor
organization.
and
then
i
proceed
next
to
section
403
which
is
on
the
top
of
page
7a,
there
is
a
first
sentence
there
which
is
not
relevant
to
this
case.
but
the
next
two
sentences,
i
think
are
both
highly
relevant,
“existing
rights
and
remedies
to
enforce
the
constitution
and
bylaws
of
a
labor
organization
with
respect
to
elections
prior
to
the
conduct
thereof
shall
not
be
affected
by
the
provisions
of
this
sub
chapter,
whatever
rights
there
are,
state
or
federal
still
remain”.
and
then
the
next
sentence,
“the
remedy
provided
by
this
sub
chapter
for
challenging
an
election
already
conducted
shall
be
exclusive.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
as
to
a
suit
after
the
election,
yes
mr.
justice.
as
to
a
suit
prior
to
an
election,
not
at
all,
because
it
does
not
relate
to
a
suit
prior
to
an
election.
now,
i
agree
that
it
does
not
say
shall
be
exclusive
and
this
shall
apply
to
intervention.
at
no
place
does
the
legislative
history
or
anything
else
contain
the
words,
and
this
shall
apply
to
intervention,
that's
why
i
say
i
can't
mathematically
demonstrate
the
result.
but
i
want
to
go
ahead
with
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
to
show
that,
that
language
was
deliberately
intended
by
congress,
it
was
not
incidental
or
accidental,
and
that
the
scheme
which
congress
meant
to
carry
out
by
this
statute
is
one
which
would
be
frustrating
by
allowing
intervention
of
other
parties
and
the
secretary.
what
congress
intended
was
not
merely
that
the
secretary
should
file
a
suit
but
that
he
should
control
the
suit,
and
he
will
not
control
the
suit
if
intervention
is
allowed.
if
mr.
rauh's
plan
can
intervene
any
other
union
member,
can
intervene
including
members
of
the
opposition
and
the
scheme
which
congress
deliberately
set
up
in
this
difficult
and
delicate
area,
would
i
think
be
clearly
frustrated.
now
the
labor-management
disclosure
act
perhaps
can
be
said
to
find
its
legislative
geneses
in
a
bill
which
was
introduced
by
senator
kennedy
in
may
1958.
and
this
contains
essentially
the
language
which
is
now
found
in
section
402,
with
only
a
very
few
changes.
senator
kennedy
said
that,
there
had
been
evidence
that
some
few
unions
have
not
conducted
their
affairs
in
a
democratic
manner
and
since
free
secret
elections
are
the
cornerstone
of
the
democratic
union
movement,
it
appears
appropriate
that
public
safeguards
be
established,
and
that
is
the
first
legislative
statement
with
respect
to
the
language.
the
bill
introduced
in
may
1958
contained
the
language
that
the
remedies
enunciated
therein
were
to
be
exclusive,
so
that
only
the
secretary
that
brings
such
a
civil
action.
now
this
incidentally
applied
both
before
and
after
elections.
nothing
much
came
of
that
bill
but
in
june
1958
there
was
introduced
another
bill
as
3974
of
that
congress
known
as
the
kennedy-ives
bill.
senator
kennedy
had
build
up
support
within
the
senate
and
this
was
passed
by
the
senate
on
june
17,
1958,
seven
days
after
it
was
introduced,
obviously
showing
that
it
had
been
worked
on
and
agreed
to
by
substantial
number
of
senators.
and
the
committee
report
with
respect
to
section
301
in
that
bill
is
now
section
401,
states
that
these
provisions,
“are
to
be
enforced
by
the
secretary
of
labor
upon
complaint
of
any
union
member”
and
the
report
further
stated
explicitly
that,
“private
court
litigation
would
be
precluded”.
in
the
course
of
the
senate
debates
on
june
12,
1958
senator
kennedy
presented
some
of
the
reasons
for
giving
the
secretary
the
sole
authority.
senator
wiley
expressed
his
concern
that
this
would
involve
the
destruction
of
the
present
rights
of
union
members
to
seek
state
and
federal
court
relief.
and
senator
kennedy
responded
that
such
relief
was
costly
and
time
consuming
as
a
practical
matter
unsatisfactory.
he
said
that,
the
bill
chose
rather
to
“provide
the
right
to
appeal
to
the
secretary
of
labor,
whenever
a
member
believes
that
his
rights
as
provided
in
the
bill
in
the
case
of
an
election
have
been
denied
to
him”.
now
the
petitioners
in
this
case
do
refer
in
their
brief
on
page
28
to
a
statement
of
senator
kennedy
in
the
debate
which
they
say
points
in
their
direction.
but
as
mr.
rauh
has
already
indicated
in
giving
the
quotation
on
page
28
of
their
brief,
they
omit
entirely
the
immediately
preceding
sentence,
which
contains
the
language
which
he
read
except
where
the
bill
provides
specifically
to
the
contrary.
and
we
contend
that
this
bill
does
provide
that
with
respect
to
post
election
relief,
that
the
enforcement
rights
are
solely
in
the
secretary.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice
there
is
always
of
course
the
situation
of
no
good
faith
of
complete
walking
away
and
not
meeting
your
responsibility.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
anywhere,
no
mr.
justice,
we
do
not
and
i
think
that's
important.
with
respect
to
the
question
whether
the
past
election
shall
be
set
aside,
we
say
it
does
preclude
them
from
seeking
any
remedy
anywhere.
but
we
see
no
reason
why
they
are
not
free
to
maintain
a
suit
with
respect
to
the
forthcoming
election.
section
403
completely
preserves
all
rights
with
respect
to
any
future
election
and
we
know
of
no
reason
why
they
cannot
maintain
a
suit
in
the
appropriate
court.
i
don't
know
whether
it
would
be
state
or
federal
to
raise
the
question
with
respect
to
the
pensionary
unions.
they
already
have
the
suit
pending
with
respect
to
the
validity
of
the
pension
increased,
it's
true
it's
not
focused
on
the
election,
but
it
can
be.
and
they
have
pointed
out
in
their
brief
that
before
this
election,
mr.
yablonski
was
forced
to
initiate
five
suits
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
to
secure
the
rights
guaranteed
to
him
and
other
umwa
members
under
the
act.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
are
addressed
to
setting
aside
the
past
election,
but
the
secretary
having
made
investigation
has
decided
that
these
are
not
grounds
upon
which
he
thinks
it
appropriate
to
proceed,
and
our
position
is
that
the
congress
has
made
him
the
exclusive
judge
of
that.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
as
to
the
past
election,
i
would
agree.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
that
–
you
meant
under
rule
24
with
respect
to
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
that
--
my
answer
to
that
would
be
impart
that
congress
has
allocated
the
determination
of
this
question
to
the
secretary,
and
that
under
rule
82
and
the
enabling
act
and
decisions
of
this
court,
the
rule
cannot
extend
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
which
is
limited
exclusively
to
actions
by
the
secretary.
and
that,
that
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
scheme
with
the
statute
has
provided.
i
would
call
attention
to
the
language
of
rule
82,
“these
rules
shall
not
be
construed
to
extend
or
limit
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
district
courts”,
and
i
would
suggest
that
to
say
that
the
petitioners
here
can
intervene
under
section
42,
although
it
is
established
that
the
suit
by
the
secretary
is
the
exclusive
right,
would
be
extending
the
jurisdiction.
and
i
would
call
attention
to
cases
such
as
(inaudible)
and
wilson
and
united
states
v.
sherwood,
both
in
312
us.
and
in
sebac
and
wilson
the
court
referred
to
the
inability
court
by
rule
to
extend
or
restrict
the
jurisdiction
as
conferred
by
statute.
and
if
this
statute
means
what
it
says
that
the
suit
by
the
secretary
shall
be
the
exclusive
remedy,
then
i
think
that
the
construction
of
rule
24
for
which
mr.
rauh
contends
would
amount
to
an
extension
of
the
jurisdiction,
and
in
effect
an
amendment
of
section
403
as
congress
has
passed
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
am
not
sure
mr.
justice.
i
think
it's
hard
to
say.
mr.
rauh
says
that
my
predecessor
who
represented
the
secretary
in
the
court
of
appeals
conceded
that
in
the
court
of
appeals.
i
am
told
that
he
does
not
so
understand
what
he
said,
but
i
think
it
is
a
question
which
is
very
difficult
for
us.
it
is
really
a
question
whether
the
petitioners
here
are
adequately
represented
by
the
secretary.
now,
it
is
perfectly
plain
that
the
secretary
is
not
presenting
every
issue
and
every
ground.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
alright,
is
not
presenting
every
argument
that
they
would
like
to
have
presented,
and
i
think
that
turns
somewhat
upon
the
question,
what
you
mean
by
representation,
particularly
in
the
light
of
a
statute
which
prescribes
that
a
remedy
shall
be
the
exclusive
remedy.
mr.
rauh
refers
to
an
article
by
david
shapiro
in
which
he
holds
open
this
question,
but
it
isn't
clear
to
me
that
mr.
shapiro
gave
adequate
weight
not
merely
to
the
language
of
the
statute
that
it
shall
be
the
exclusive
remedy,
but
also
to
the
very
clear
legislative
history.
i
think
the
question
of
intervention
is
a
question
of
balance
between
many
factors.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
that's
very
close
to
accurate
mr.
justice
and
if
one
reads
exclusive,
to
mean
exclusive,
then
section
24(a)
becomes
irrelevant.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
can't
quite
say
mr.
chief
justice.
if
the
court
says
that
exclusive
doesn't
mean
exclusive,
i
find
it
somewhat
difficult
to
see
how
a
court
could
say
that
any
union
member
cannot
intervene
if
he
thinks
he
has
a
point
of
view
which
isn't
going
to
be
fairly
represented.
this
gets
a
little
bit
like
the
argument
in
the
case
which
i
presented
yesterday.
here
is
a
case
where
i
think
the
congress
[voice
overlap]
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
not
always
mr.
justice,
but
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
between
yesterday
and
today,
i
am.
this
is
a
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
not
quite
mr.
justice.
when
congress
say
the
outsiders
must
be
kept
out.
when
congress
deliberately
allocates
a
function
to
be
handled
by
the
secretary
and
says
that,
that
shall
be
exclusive
in
post
election
suits,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
it
is
entirely
appropriate
for
the
court
to
say
that
this
is
a
matter
which
can
properly
be
allocated
by
congress
to
the
exclusive
handling
by
the
secretary.
i
repeat
this
does
not
foreclose
mr.
rauh
and
his
clients
from
raising
and
whatever
appropriate
court
there
is
any
issue
including
these
two
issues
in
advance
of
any
election,
including
the
election
which
will
be
conducted
by
the
secretary.
indeed,
i
am
not
sure
that
it
precludes
the
secretary
from
filing
a
suit
in
connection
with
the
holding
of
the
election
under
this
suit
in
which
he
in
effect
asked
for
an
instructions,
asked
for
a
declaratory
judgment.
this
is
somewhat
complicated
by
this
court's
decision
last
spring
in
the
hodgson
v.
the
steelworkers
case
which
says
that
the
secretary
can't
raise
issues
in
the
402
proceeding
which
were
not
presented
to
him
by
the
employee.
but
i
am
not
sure
after
the
402
proceeding
is
completed,
and
it
has
been
decided
that
there
shall
be
a
new
election
that
the
secretary
cannot
then
raise
in
court
questioned
with
respect
to
the
conduct
of
that
election.
and
i
know
of
no
reason
why
mr.
rauh
and
his
clients
cannot
raise
those
questions
in
court
with
respect
to
the
conduct
of
an
election.
now
let
me
say
that
the
position
advanced
here
by
mr.
rauh
is
a
reasonable
one,
it
was
the
view
of
a
large
part
of
congress
and
the
bill
passed
the
house
once
and
depending
how
you
interpreted,
i
think
twice
the
way
he
says.
but
the
other
view
is
the
one
which
was
finally
enacted
by
congress
and
both
houses
adopted.
we
have
set
out
in
our
brief
more
legislative
history
including
important
statements
by
professor
cox
who
was
well
known
to
be
senator
kennedy's
immediate
advisor
and
the
draftsmen
of
the
act,
and
among
other
things,
he
said
that
the
purpose
of
the
bill
was
to
centralize
control
of
the
proceedings
in
the
secretary
of
labor.
it
was
also
professor
cox
who
recognized,
and
i
assumed
prevailed
on
senator
kennedy
to
except
the
change
so
that
the
exclusive
suit
by
the
secretary
was
made
applicable
only
to
post
election
proceedings.
the
house
adopted
the
bill
in
such
a
way
that
the
employee
could
bring
the
suit
at
anytime,
there
were
hearings
before
the
house
committee
in
which
mr.
railey(ph)
made
essentially
the
same
point
that
mr.
justice
white
has
been
making
with
me.
he
said,
“there
is
all
the
difference
in
the
world
between
having
an
administrative
remedy
and
being
able
to
control
the
litigation
yourself.
would
you
not
rather
prepare
the
case
yourself
and
present
it,
then
go
to
an
administrative
agency?”
the
house
adopted
the
bill
that
way.
it
went
to
conference
and
it
came
out
of
conference
in
the
form
of
the
senate
bill
with
the
language
in
the
statute
to
which
i
have
referred,
which
seems
to
me
to
be,
to
use
a
word
which
just
came
into
our
law
recently,be
to
be
facially
conclusive,
the
exclusive
suit
by
the
secretary.
and
which
i
believe
is
thoroughly
supported
by
the
legislative
history.
it
is
perfectly
true
the
legislative
history
does
not
say
and
there
shall
be
no
intervention,
but
it
seems
to
me
to
be
very
clear
or
indeed
the
sort
of
question
which
the
courts
are
well
qualified
to
decide,
that
it
was
the
contemplation
an
expectation
of
congress
that
there
should
not
be
any
sort
of
interference
with
the
suit
brought
by
the
secretary.
but
this
was
allocated
to
the
secretary
for
a
very
real
public
purpose.
after
all,
when
there
is
a
dispute
about
an
election,
after
the
election
has
been
held,
there
is
a
great
deal
of
feeling
in
many
quarters
and
if
you
then
have
the
big
complete
comprehensive
lawsuit
in
which
all
the
issues
are
raised
and
all
the
emotions
are
led
out,
things
become
not
only
difficult
but
perhaps
unsatisfactory.
and
the
purpose
was
to
filter
this
through,
the
secretary
of
labor,
and
i
may
say
that
in
this
case
he
made
an
enormous
investigation
with
respect
to
what
went
on
here.
and
then
have
the
secretary
decide
which
issues
he
thinks
are
the
ones
which
should
be
presented
in
court,
and
if
we
go
through
all
that
process,
but
nevertheless
the
union
disputants
can
intervene
on
both
sides
and
convert
the
lawsuit
for
setting
aside
an
election
and
providing
for
the
conduct
of
a
new
election,
convert
that
into
a
general
intra-union
dispute
settlement
procedure.
we
have,
it
seems
to
me,
destroyed
the
very
remedy
which
congress
deliberately
chose
and
established
in
these
particular
cases.
now
i
agree
that
rule
24
(a)
is
there,
it's
not
unimportant,
i
don't
say
it
is
irrelevant.
rule
82
which
seems
to
me,
restricts
its
scope
and
i
think
that
although
rule
24
(a)
might
in
other
settings
be
adequate
to
allow
for
intervention
here,
generally
of
course
intervention
is
encouraged,
it
is
welcomed,
that
was
the
function
of
enlarging
the
scope
in
rule
24
(a).
but
here
there
is
a
very
special
reason
for
keeping
the
control
of
the
suit
in
the
secretary.
that
reason
was
explicitly
intended
by
congress
by
a
close
division;
the
house
one
way,
the
senate
the
other
way,
we
do
not
know
what
went
on
in
the
conference
to
lead
to
the
choice
to
the
senate
bill.
we
do
know
that
both
houses
of
congress
approved
the
senate
bill
and
provided
in
the
laws,
it
has
been
since
1959,
that
the
suit
by
the
secretary
should
be
exclusive
and
we
think
that
exclusive
means
that
there
should
not
be
intervention.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
i
begin,
i
would
like
to
call
attention
to
the
brief
which
we
have
filed
in
this
case.
for
the
first
time
and
literally
thousands
of
these
briefs
that
i've
seen,
the
table
of
contents
and
the
table
of
cases
is
at
the
end
and
instead
of
at
the
beginning.
i
don't
have
any
idea
why
it
happened.
the
government
printing
office
has
printed
these
for
50-75
years.
as
you
will
recall
the
case
is
here
on
an
expedited
schedule
and
when
i
found
this
out
on
monday,
i
decided
that
we
would
simply
leave
it
as
it
as
and
not
try
to
incur
overtime
and
what
not
and
have
it
reprinted.
i've
already
found
that
something
of
an
inconvenience
myself
because
naturally
you
turn
to
the
front
and
i
say
i'm
sorry
but
that's
what
happened
and
there
are
some
things
even
a
solicitor
general
can’t
control.
the
case
here
turns
on
the
construction
of
a
statute
i
believe
which
is
illuminated
by
the
legislative
history.
i
do
not
think
that
i
can
demonstrate
by
logic
like
that
involved
in
the
binomial
theorem,
that
the
result
for
which
i
contend
is
inevitable.
i
do
think
or
hope
that
i
can
make
about
a
stronger
case
on
legislative
history,
as
i
can
imagine
short
of
demonstration
which
i
think
should
lead
the
court
to
the
conclusion,
that
the
statutory
provision
should
be
construed
to
prevent
intervention
in
this
case.
let
me
look
first
at
the
language
of
the
statute
to
which
not
much
attention
has
been
paid
in
the
argument
so
far.
and
i'm
referring
now
to
the
brief
of
the
united
mine
workers,
the
blue
covered
brief
which
has
the
statute's
most
comprehensively
in
the
appendix
at
the
end.
let
me
say
also
by
a
way
of
opening
that
in
this
trial
which
is
now
going
on,
the
work
for
the
moment
is
in
recess
in
the
district
court.
the
secretary
is
vigorously
opposing
the
united
mine
workers.
on
this
particular
aspect
of
it,
relating
to
intervention,
the
secretary
and
united
mine
workers
are
on
the
same
side,
the
united
mine
workers
have
yielded
the
time
which
they
could
have
had
in
this
oral
argument
to
me
because
they
share
our
view
that
this
is
a
suit
and
the
district
court
which
is
and
ought
to
be
in
the
control
of
the
secretary
but
mr.
coomes
(ph)
here
is
representing
the
united
mine
worker.
now
section
402.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice,
i'm
understand
that
he
is
going
ahead
on
the
basis
of
his
decision
and
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
the
case
come
to
a
conclusion
before
you
decide
it,
i
don't
know
what
would
happen.
i
assume
that
if
you
should
decide
that
intervention
is
allowed
that
he
would
then
reopen
the
record
and
allow
the
presentation
of
the
material
which
mr.
rauh
once
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
he
wants
to,
i
assume,
but
he
would
i
suppose
be
entitled
to
recall
witnesses
for
cross
examination
and
other
items
of
that
kind.
all
of
this
i
should
take
was
within
the
control
of
the
trial
judge
and
i
have
not
heard
any
suggestion
that
it
is
not
a
matter
which
can
be
worked
out.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
certainly,
no
jury
involved,
and
certainly
if
the
court's
decision
is
adverse
to
our
position,
the
secretary
will
cooperate
and
trying
to
put
the
court's
decision
into
practical
effect.
section
402
of
the
statute
which
is
the
labor-management
reporting
and
disclosure
act
of
1959,
quite
a
landmark
in
our
labor
relations
law,
section
402
begins
on
page
5a
of
the
appendix
to
the
brief,
and
it
says,
that
a
member
of
a
labor
organization
who
has
exhausted
his
remedies
in
the
union,
and
who
has
invoked
his
available
remedies
without
obtaining
a
final
decision
within
three
calender
months,
may
file
a
complaint
with
the
secretary
under
section
481.
and
section
481
sets
out
in
considerable
details,
standard
for
the
conduct
of
elections.
402
(b)
provides
that
the
secretary
shall
investigate
and
if
he
finds
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
violation
has
occurred,
he
should
bring
a
civil
action
against
the
labor
organization
in
the
district
court
of
the
united
states.
and
then
section
402
(c)
provides
that
if
upon
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
after
trial
on
the
merits,
the
court
plans
that
an
election
has
not
been
held
within
the
time
prescribed
by
section
481
or
482,
that
the
violation
of
section
481
of
this
title
may
have
affected
the
outcome
of
an
election.
the
court
shall
declare
the
election,
if
any
to
be
void,
and
direct
the
conduct
of
a
new
election
under
supervision
of
the
secretary,
and
so
far
as
lawful
and
practicable
in
conformity
with
the
constitution
and
bylaws
of
the
labor
organization.
and
then
i
proceed
next
to
section
403
which
is
on
the
top
of
page
7a,
there
is
a
first
sentence
there
which
is
not
relevant
to
this
case.
but
the
next
two
sentences,
i
think
are
both
highly
relevant,
“existing
rights
and
remedies
to
enforce
the
constitution
and
bylaws
of
a
labor
organization
with
respect
to
elections
prior
to
the
conduct
thereof
shall
not
be
affected
by
the
provisions
of
this
sub
chapter,
whatever
rights
there
are,
state
or
federal
still
remain”.
and
then
the
next
sentence,
“the
remedy
provided
by
this
sub
chapter
for
challenging
an
election
already
conducted
shall
be
exclusive.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
as
to
a
suit
after
the
election,
yes
mr.
justice.
as
to
a
suit
prior
to
an
election,
not
at
all,
because
it
does
not
relate
to
a
suit
prior
to
an
election.
now,
i
agree
that
it
does
not
say
shall
be
exclusive
and
this
shall
apply
to
intervention.
at
no
place
does
the
legislative
history
or
anything
else
contain
the
words,
and
this
shall
apply
to
intervention,
that's
why
i
say
i
can't
mathematically
demonstrate
the
result.
but
i
want
to
go
ahead
with
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
to
show
that,
that
language
was
deliberately
intended
by
congress,
it
was
not
incidental
or
accidental,
and
that
the
scheme
which
congress
meant
to
carry
out
by
this
statute
is
one
which
would
be
frustrating
by
allowing
intervention
of
other
parties
and
the
secretary.
what
congress
intended
was
not
merely
that
the
secretary
should
file
a
suit
but
that
he
should
control
the
suit,
and
he
will
not
control
the
suit
if
intervention
is
allowed.
if
mr.
rauh's
plan
can
intervene
any
other
union
member,
can
intervene
including
members
of
the
opposition
and
the
scheme
which
congress
deliberately
set
up
in
this
difficult
and
delicate
area,
would
i
think
be
clearly
frustrated.
now
the
labor-management
disclosure
act
perhaps
can
be
said
to
find
its
legislative
geneses
in
a
bill
which
was
introduced
by
senator
kennedy
in
may
1958.
and
this
contains
essentially
the
language
which
is
now
found
in
section
402,
with
only
a
very
few
changes.
senator
kennedy
said
that,
there
had
been
evidence
that
some
few
unions
have
not
conducted
their
affairs
in
a
democratic
manner
and
since
free
secret
elections
are
the
cornerstone
of
the
democratic
union
movement,
it
appears
appropriate
that
public
safeguards
be
established,
and
that
is
the
first
legislative
statement
with
respect
to
the
language.
the
bill
introduced
in
may
1958
contained
the
language
that
the
remedies
enunciated
therein
were
to
be
exclusive,
so
that
only
the
secretary
that
brings
such
a
civil
action.
now
this
incidentally
applied
both
before
and
after
elections.
nothing
much
came
of
that
bill
but
in
june
1958
there
was
introduced
another
bill
as
3974
of
that
congress
known
as
the
kennedy-ives
bill.
senator
kennedy
had
build
up
support
within
the
senate
and
this
was
passed
by
the
senate
on
june
17,
1958,
seven
days
after
it
was
introduced,
obviously
showing
that
it
had
been
worked
on
and
agreed
to
by
substantial
number
of
senators.
and
the
committee
report
with
respect
to
section
301
in
that
bill
is
now
section
401,
states
that
these
provisions,
“are
to
be
enforced
by
the
secretary
of
labor
upon
complaint
of
any
union
member”
and
the
report
further
stated
explicitly
that,
“private
court
litigation
would
be
precluded”.
in
the
course
of
the
senate
debates
on
june
12,
1958
senator
kennedy
presented
some
of
the
reasons
for
giving
the
secretary
the
sole
authority.
senator
wiley
expressed
his
concern
that
this
would
involve
the
destruction
of
the
present
rights
of
union
members
to
seek
state
and
federal
court
relief.
and
senator
kennedy
responded
that
such
relief
was
costly
and
time
consuming
as
a
practical
matter
unsatisfactory.
he
said
that,
the
bill
chose
rather
to
“provide
the
right
to
appeal
to
the
secretary
of
labor,
whenever
a
member
believes
that
his
rights
as
provided
in
the
bill
in
the
case
of
an
election
have
been
denied
to
him”.
now
the
petitioners
in
this
case
do
refer
in
their
brief
on
page
28
to
a
statement
of
senator
kennedy
in
the
debate
which
they
say
points
in
their
direction.
but
as
mr.
rauh
has
already
indicated
in
giving
the
quotation
on
page
28
of
their
brief,
they
omit
entirely
the
immediately
preceding
sentence,
which
contains
the
language
which
he
read
except
where
the
bill
provides
specifically
to
the
contrary.
and
we
contend
that
this
bill
does
provide
that
with
respect
to
post
election
relief,
that
the
enforcement
rights
are
solely
in
the
secretary.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice
there
is
always
of
course
the
situation
of
no
good
faith
of
complete
walking
away
and
not
meeting
your
responsibility.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
anywhere,
no
mr.
justice,
we
do
not
and
i
think
that's
important.
with
respect
to
the
question
whether
the
past
election
shall
be
set
aside,
we
say
it
does
preclude
them
from
seeking
any
remedy
anywhere.
but
we
see
no
reason
why
they
are
not
free
to
maintain
a
suit
with
respect
to
the
forthcoming
election.
section
403
completely
preserves
all
rights
with
respect
to
any
future
election
and
we
know
of
no
reason
why
they
cannot
maintain
a
suit
in
the
appropriate
court.
i
don't
know
whether
it
would
be
state
or
federal
to
raise
the
question
with
respect
to
the
pensionary
unions.
they
already
have
the
suit
pending
with
respect
to
the
validity
of
the
pension
increased,
it's
true
it's
not
focused
on
the
election,
but
it
can
be.
and
they
have
pointed
out
in
their
brief
that
before
this
election,
mr.
yablonski
was
forced
to
initiate
five
suits
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
to
secure
the
rights
guaranteed
to
him
and
other
umwa
members
under
the
act.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
are
addressed
to
setting
aside
the
past
election,
but
the
secretary
having
made
investigation
has
decided
that
these
are
not
grounds
upon
which
he
thinks
it
appropriate
to
proceed,
and
our
position
is
that
the
congress
has
made
him
the
exclusive
judge
of
that.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
as
to
the
past
election,
i
would
agree.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
that
–
you
meant
under
rule
24
with
respect
to
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
that
--
my
answer
to
that
would
be
impart
that
congress
has
allocated
the
determination
of
this
question
to
the
secretary,
and
that
under
rule
82
and
the
enabling
act
and
decisions
of
this
court,
the
rule
cannot
extend
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
which
is
limited
exclusively
to
actions
by
the
secretary.
and
that,
that
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
scheme
with
the
statute
has
provided.
i
would
call
attention
to
the
language
of
rule
82,
“these
rules
shall
not
be
construed
to
extend
or
limit
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
district
courts”,
and
i
would
suggest
that
to
say
that
the
petitioners
here
can
intervene
under
section
42,
although
it
is
established
that
the
suit
by
the
secretary
is
the
exclusive
right,
would
be
extending
the
jurisdiction.
and
i
would
call
attention
to
cases
such
as
(inaudible)
and
wilson
and
united
states
v.
sherwood,
both
in
312
us.
and
in
sebac
and
wilson
the
court
referred
to
the
inability
court
by
rule
to
extend
or
restrict
the
jurisdiction
as
conferred
by
statute.
and
if
this
statute
means
what
it
says
that
the
suit
by
the
secretary
shall
be
the
exclusive
remedy,
then
i
think
that
the
construction
of
rule
24
for
which
mr.
rauh
contends
would
amount
to
an
extension
of
the
jurisdiction,
and
in
effect
an
amendment
of
section
403
as
congress
has
passed
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
am
not
sure
mr.
justice.
i
think
it's
hard
to
say.
mr.
rauh
says
that
my
predecessor
who
represented
the
secretary
in
the
court
of
appeals
conceded
that
in
the
court
of
appeals.
i
am
told
that
he
does
not
so
understand
what
he
said,
but
i
think
it
is
a
question
which
is
very
difficult
for
us.
it
is
really
a
question
whether
the
petitioners
here
are
adequately
represented
by
the
secretary.
now,
it
is
perfectly
plain
that
the
secretary
is
not
presenting
every
issue
and
every
ground.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
alright,
is
not
presenting
every
argument
that
they
would
like
to
have
presented,
and
i
think
that
turns
somewhat
upon
the
question,
what
you
mean
by
representation,
particularly
in
the
light
of
a
statute
which
prescribes
that
a
remedy
shall
be
the
exclusive
remedy.
mr.
rauh
refers
to
an
article
by
david
shapiro
in
which
he
holds
open
this
question,
but
it
isn't
clear
to
me
that
mr.
shapiro
gave
adequate
weight
not
merely
to
the
language
of
the
statute
that
it
shall
be
the
exclusive
remedy,
but
also
to
the
very
clear
legislative
history.
i
think
the
question
of
intervention
is
a
question
of
balance
between
many
factors.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
that's
very
close
to
accurate
mr.
justice
and
if
one
reads
exclusive,
to
mean
exclusive,
then
section
24(a)
becomes
irrelevant.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
can't
quite
say
mr.
chief
justice.
if
the
court
says
that
exclusive
doesn't
mean
exclusive,
i
find
it
somewhat
difficult
to
see
how
a
court
could
say
that
any
union
member
cannot
intervene
if
he
thinks
he
has
a
point
of
view
which
isn't
going
to
be
fairly
represented.
this
gets
a
little
bit
like
the
argument
in
the
case
which
i
presented
yesterday.
here
is
a
case
where
i
think
the
congress
[voice
overlap]
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
not
always
mr.
justice,
but
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
between
yesterday
and
today,
i
am.
this
is
a
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
not
quite
mr.
justice.
when
congress
say
the
outsiders
must
be
kept
out.
when
congress
deliberately
allocates
a
function
to
be
handled
by
the
secretary
and
says
that,
that
shall
be
exclusive
in
post
election
suits,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
it
is
entirely
appropriate
for
the
court
to
say
that
this
is
a
matter
which
can
properly
be
allocated
by
congress
to
the
exclusive
handling
by
the
secretary.
i
repeat
this
does
not
foreclose
mr.
rauh
and
his
clients
from
raising
and
whatever
appropriate
court
there
is
any
issue
including
these
two
issues
in
advance
of
any
election,
including
the
election
which
will
be
conducted
by
the
secretary.
indeed,
i
am
not
sure
that
it
precludes
the
secretary
from
filing
a
suit
in
connection
with
the
holding
of
the
election
under
this
suit
in
which
he
in
effect
asked
for
an
instructions,
asked
for
a
declaratory
judgment.
this
is
somewhat
complicated
by
this
court's
decision
last
spring
in
the
hodgson
v.
the
steelworkers
case
which
says
that
the
secretary
can't
raise
issues
in
the
402
proceeding
which
were
not
presented
to
him
by
the
employee.
but
i
am
not
sure
after
the
402
proceeding
is
completed,
and
it
has
been
decided
that
there
shall
be
a
new
election
that
the
secretary
cannot
then
raise
in
court
questioned
with
respect
to
the
conduct
of
that
election.
and
i
know
of
no
reason
why
mr.
rauh
and
his
clients
cannot
raise
those
questions
in
court
with
respect
to
the
conduct
of
an
election.
now
let
me
say
that
the
position
advanced
here
by
mr.
rauh
is
a
reasonable
one,
it
was
the
view
of
a
large
part
of
congress
and
the
bill
passed
the
house
once
and
depending
how
you
interpreted,
i
think
twice
the
way
he
says.
but
the
other
view
is
the
one
which
was
finally
enacted
by
congress
and
both
houses
adopted.
we
have
set
out
in
our
brief
more
legislative
history
including
important
statements
by
professor
cox
who
was
well
known
to
be
senator
kennedy's
immediate
advisor
and
the
draftsmen
of
the
act,
and
among
other
things,
he
said
that
the
purpose
of
the
bill
was
to
centralize
control
of
the
proceedings
in
the
secretary
of
labor.
it
was
also
professor
cox
who
recognized,
and
i
assumed
prevailed
on
senator
kennedy
to
except
the
change
so
that
the
exclusive
suit
by
the
secretary
was
made
applicable
only
to
post
election
proceedings.
the
house
adopted
the
bill
in
such
a
way
that
the
employee
could
bring
the
suit
at
anytime,
there
were
hearings
before
the
house
committee
in
which
mr.
railey(ph)
made
essentially
the
same
point
that
mr.
justice
white
has
been
making
with
me.
he
said,
“there
is
all
the
difference
in
the
world
between
having
an
administrative
remedy
and
being
able
to
control
the
litigation
yourself.
would
you
not
rather
prepare
the
case
yourself
and
present
it,
then
go
to
an
administrative
agency?”
the
house
adopted
the
bill
that
way.
it
went
to
conference
and
it
came
out
of
conference
in
the
form
of
the
senate
bill
with
the
language
in
the
statute
to
which
i
have
referred,
which
seems
to
me
to
be,
to
use
a
word
which
just
came
into
our
law
recently,be
to
be
facially
conclusive,
the
exclusive
suit
by
the
secretary.
and
which
i
believe
is
thoroughly
supported
by
the
legislative
history.
it
is
perfectly
true
the
legislative
history
does
not
say
and
there
shall
be
no
intervention,
but
it
seems
to
me
to
be
very
clear
or
indeed
the
sort
of
question
which
the
courts
are
well
qualified
to
decide,
that
it
was
the
contemplation
an
expectation
of
congress
that
there
should
not
be
any
sort
of
interference
with
the
suit
brought
by
the
secretary.
but
this
was
allocated
to
the
secretary
for
a
very
real
public
purpose.
after
all,
when
there
is
a
dispute
about
an
election,
after
the
election
has
been
held,
there
is
a
great
deal
of
feeling
in
many
quarters
and
if
you
then
have
the
big
complete
comprehensive
lawsuit
in
which
all
the
issues
are
raised
and
all
the
emotions
are
led
out,
things
become
not
only
difficult
but
perhaps
unsatisfactory.
and
the
purpose
was
to
filter
this
through,
the
secretary
of
labor,
and
i
may
say
that
in
this
case
he
made
an
enormous
investigation
with
respect
to
what
went
on
here.
and
then
have
the
secretary
decide
which
issues
he
thinks
are
the
ones
which
should
be
presented
in
court,
and
if
we
go
through
all
that
process,
but
nevertheless
the
union
disputants
can
intervene
on
both
sides
and
convert
the
lawsuit
for
setting
aside
an
election
and
providing
for
the
conduct
of
a
new
election,
convert
that
into
a
general
intra-union
dispute
settlement
procedure.
we
have,
it
seems
to
me,
destroyed
the
very
remedy
which
congress
deliberately
chose
and
established
in
these
particular
cases.
now
i
agree
that
rule
24
(a)
is
there,
it's
not
unimportant,
i
don't
say
it
is
irrelevant.
rule
82
which
seems
to
me,
restricts
its
scope
and
i
think
that
although
rule
24
(a)
might
in
other
settings
be
adequate
to
allow
for
intervention
here,
generally
of
course
intervention
is
encouraged,
it
is
welcomed,
that
was
the
function
of
enlarging
the
scope
in
rule
24
(a).
but
here
there
is
a
very
special
reason
for
keeping
the
control
of
the
suit
in
the
secretary.
that
reason
was
explicitly
intended
by
congress
by
a
close
division;
the
house
one
way,
the
senate
the
other
way,
we
do
not
know
what
went
on
in
the
conference
to
lead
to
the
choice
to
the
senate
bill.
we
do
know
that
both
houses
of
congress
approved
the
senate
bill
and
provided
in
the
laws,
it
has
been
since
1959,
that
the
suit
by
the
secretary
should
be
exclusive
and
we
think
that
exclusive
means
that
there
should
not
be
intervention.
