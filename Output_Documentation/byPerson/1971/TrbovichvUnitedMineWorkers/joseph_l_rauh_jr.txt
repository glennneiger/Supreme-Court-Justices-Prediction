mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
courts
below
held
the
petitioner,
the
head
of
the
reform
group,
within
the
united
mine
workers
could
not
intervene
in
the
secretory
of
labor
suit
to
upset
the
1969
union
election
in
which
petitioner
and
his
reform
group
have
an
intense
interest.
the
question
here
on
certiorari
is
whether
the
courts
below
erred
heard
in
beholding
that
the
labor
management
reporting
and
disclosure
act
carves
an
exception
out
of
rule
24
(a)
and
thus
bars
the
intervention
of
petitioner's
reform
group.
on
may
29th,
1969,
mr
joseph
yablonski
announced
that
he
would
run
for
president
of
the
united
mine
workers
of
america.
between
may
29th
and
december
9th
of
1969,
the
date
of
the
election,
yablonski
was
forced
to
bring
five
lawsuits.
in
three
of
these,
we
got
our
preliminary
injunctions
giving
us
the
right
to
mail
out
literature,
getting
yablonski's
job
back
after
he
was
fired
in
reprisal
firing
and
stopping
the
journal,
the
united
mine
workers
journal
from
being
used
as
campaign
literature.
in
one
of
the
five
suits,
we
didn't
get
an
order
but
the
--
before
that
the
mine
workers
had
done
in
court
what
we
asked
for,
namely
to
tell
what
rules
of
the
election
would
be.
in
the
fifth
suit
which
was
a
suit
to
make
to
mr.
bloch
and
the
others
payback
what
they
have
taken
from
the
union
is
still
pending.
now
in
addition
to
these
lawsuits,
mr.
yablonski
also
sought
an
investigation
by
the
secretory
of
labor
of
the
massive
violations
going
on
during
the
election
but
despite
the
clear
language
in
section
601
of
the
lmrda
and
despite
this
court's
statement
in
footnote
5
in
the
labors
case
that
section
601
applied
here
and
he
could
investigate
and
despite
the
fact
that
we
detailed
the
violations
of
law,
the
secretory
of
labor
refused
to
make
any
investigation.
so
there
came
december
9th
and
the
incumbents
declared
themselves
elected.
two
points
might
be
mentioned
on
this
election,
first,
what
we
had
poll
watchers,
we
either
broke
even
or
one
where
we
didn't
--
we
lost
by
margins
up
to
50
to
1,
second,
as
was
found
by
the
subcommittee
on
labor,
the
decision
was
made
by
pensioners
because
they
voted
largely
voted
for
them
--
93%
voted
for
mr.
bloch.
on
december
18th,
nine
days
after
the
election,
mr.
yablonski
challenged
the
election
detailing
to
the
labor
department,
these
massive
violations.
on
january
5th,
mr.
yablonski
was
found
dead.
on
jan
20th,
the
petitioner
adopted
the
challenge,
he
had
been
mr.
yablonski's
campaign
manager
and
he
took
over
the
challenge
of
the
election.
on
march
5th,
the
secretory
of
labor
brought
the
suit
based
on
petitioner’s
challenge.
on
april
1st,
1970,
minors
for
democracy,
the
yablonski
reform
group,
was
formed.
on
october
2nd,
when
no
progress
had
been
made
in
the
suit
and
answer
hadn’t
even
been
filed,
we
moved
to
intervene.
we
saw
three
things
then
and
now
as
our
intervention,
that
is
we
seek
to
do
three
things
by
intervening.
first,
to
assure
that
the
violations
asserted
by
the
secretory
of
labor
are
speedily
and
vigorously
presented
to
the
court.
second,
to
raise
two
additional
grounds
for
upsetting
the
election,
namely
that
mr.
bloch
by
his
illegal
pension
increase
had
engaged
in
improper
interference
with
the
election
and
second
the
voting
through
illegal
locals
had
made
it
easy
for
them
to
steal
the
election,
i
referred
at
the
pension
vote
because
the
illegal
locals
are
pension
locals.
third
to
append
a
district
court
decree,
ensuring
that
the
new
election
would
not
be
a
repeat
of
the
last
one.
in
other
words,
we
seek
to
do
three
things
to
assist
and
push
the
secretory
of
labor
to
prove
what
he
has
set
out
to
prove,
to
add
two
issues
and
to
see
that
there
is
a
decree,
so
there
won't
be
a
repeat.
the
district
court
said
no
to
our
intervention,
he
said
at
page
112
of
the
appendix
that
the
landrum-griffin
act
deprived
the
court
of
jurisdiction
to
permit
our
intervention.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
without
opinion.
the
case
is
here
on
an
expedited
schedule
because
the
case
is
in
trial
below,
this
is
the
status
below.
on
september
13th
of
this
year
the
trial
started.
after
about
5
weeks
of
trial,
it
went
into
recess,
it
reconvenes
this
coming
monday,
november
22nd,
for
the
completion
of
the
government’s
case.
if
we
are
permitted
to
intervene,
we
will
not
make
any
delays,
we
are
not
going
to
ask
for
discovery,
in
fact,
i
hereby
waive
discovery,
so
that
we
can
go
right
into
the
case
as
it
is
and
we
will
go
on
with
our
case
promptly.
so
in
other
words,
there's
no
question
of
the
delays
through
our
intervention.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no
sir,
it's
in
front
of
judge
brian.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
two
issues
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
it's
different
from
hodgson.
you
said
that,
they
couldn't
add
in
hogdson,
as
i
know
you
didn’t
the
court
said,
they
couldn’t
add
in
hodgson
because
it
hadn’t
been
in
the
petitioner’s
--
in
the
complaint
--
in
the
charge.
here
it's
in
the
charge
and
question
is
whether
it
can
go
in
now
that
he
went
ahead.
so
that
that,
that
problem
is
up
but
it
is
a
different
question
than
hodgson--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
that's
correct
your
honor
and
therefore
the--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
precisely,
we
believe
--
that's
precisely
correct
your
honor,
we
believe
that
we
are
entitled
to
raise
those
two
issues,
and
that
there
is
--
because
he
has
found
probable
cause.
therefore,
once
we
get
in,
we
ought
to
raise
it,
we
ought
to
elaborate
it;
secondly
we
feel
less
should
be
left
to
the
district
court
who
has
control
of
how
broadly
intervention
would
go
and
third
we
say,
well,
if
you
we
should
not,
i
don't
know,
it
doesn't
seem
why
we
shouldn't
be
in
the
case.
and
therefore,
i
would
make
it
in
that
order.
now,
first,
we
meet
the
requirements
of
rule
24
(a)
it
fits
us
like
a
glove,
indeed
in
the
lower
court,
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
government
conceded.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
judge
right
asked
mr.
battochi
was
arguing
for
the
government
whether
we
didn't
meet
rule
24
(a)
and
whether
his
whole
argument
wasn't
that
the
lmrda
sued
at
us
and
he
said
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
at
this
moment,
i
cannot
say
that
in
their
opposition
to
cert,
they
said
that
the
secretory
hadn't
--
then
we
pointed
out
that
it
had
been
done
in
open
court
and
in
their
brief
they
don't
mention
it
so
i
suppose
it's
conceded
that
this
happened.
we
heard
with
our
own
ears.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
they
have
a
record
sir
but
we
don't
have
access
to
that,
to
the
court
of
appeal's
record,
i
think
it's
like
a
record
that
you
all
make
but
i
don't
think
that
will
challenge
there
that
mr.
battochi
said,
conceded
but
they
can
withdraw
the
confession,
i
mean
i
am
not
arguing
that
you
can't
withdraw
a
confession
sometime
during
the
case.
i
didn't
look
up
the
law
of
confessions
because
i
am
really
not
relying
on
it.
what
i
am
relying
upon
is
the
fact
that
it's
so
clear
that
we
are
in
-
that
we
meet
rule
24
(a).
that
they
even--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
intervention
of
right
and--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
precisely
you
honor
and
for
example,
our
interest
is
obvious,
our
whole
life
depends
on
the
outcome
of
this
election.
the
only
question
that
the
government
raises
while
we
don't
meet
rule
24
(a).
now
that
the
confession
has
been
withdrawn,
is
that,
they
adequately
represented
but
they
base
that
on
the
fact
that
they
say
there
are
no
private
rights
but
your
honor,
as
i
have
made
clear
in
both
the
labors
and
in
the
glass
bottle
blowers
case
that
they
are
both,
that
there
are
private
rights,
and
public
rights.
indeed
strangely
enough
the
government,
at
page
33
of
their
brief
cites
to
this
proposition
of
no
private
rights.
the
case
that
refers
to
private
rights.
at
the
bottom
of
page
33,
the
government
says,
in
the
words
of
this
court,
“the
act
was
not
designed
both
merely
to
protect
the
right
of
a
union
member
to
run
for
a
particular
office
in
a
particular
election.”
they
asserted
a
vital
public
interest.
well,
of
course,
i
will
be
the
last
person
to
say,
there
isn't
a
great
public
interest
here,
but
there
is
such
an
obvious
private
right.
it's
exactly
like
the
parallel
case
of
schofield,
where
this
court
unanimously
referred
to
the
inter-blending
of
public
and
private
rights.
the
same
inter-blending
of
public
and
private
rights
that
you
have
at
the
labor
board,
you
have
here.
now,
if
there
are
any
inter-blending
of
public
and
private
rights
which
seems
to
me
obvious
then,
we
are
the
only
one
to
protect
the
private
rights.
the
secretary
doesn’t
even
claim
to
protect
the
private
rights,
he
says,
they
aren't
any.
so
i
am
not
--
there
is
a
tremendous
hostility
between
the
labor
department,
and
our
side.
we
do
not
however
have
to
rely
on
that.
i
am
not
relying
on
that
to
show
we're
not
adequately
represented.
i
rely
on
this
very
simple
propositions,
that
the
landrum-griffin
act,
as
this
court
held,
setup
both
public
and
private
rights,
and
that
we
are
properly
to
protect
the
private
rights.
now
as
mr.
justice
white
said,
you
may
not
be
able
to
get
everything
in
there
that
you
want
to
protect
those
private
rights,
that
may,
we
argue
the
other
side,
we
are
still
the
person
to
protect
the
private
rights
insofar
as
the
district
court
in
supervising
would
permit.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
and
therefore,
the
remedy
and
the
issues
do
come
together.
that's
quite
correct,
sir,
in
the
remedy
point,
that
we
want
to
be
in
on
you
will
get
the
problem
on
the
issues
themselves
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes
sir,
precisely.
now,
assuming
there
are
private
rights
as
to
which
have
a
right
to
protect
them
under
24
(a),
and
we
meet
24
(a),
then
the
question
comes
down,
does
landrum-griffin
carve
out
an
exception
to
24(a),
does
it
say,
it
can't
get
in?
now
the
government's
brief
demonstrates
beyond
peradventure
of
doubt
what
no
one
challenges,
namely
that
we
can't
start
the
suit.
of
course
we
can't
start
the
suit,
section
403
and
the
landrum-griffin
says
it's
a
exclusive
right
of
the
secretory,
but
proving
that
we
can't
start
the
suit,
has
nothing
to
do
with
proving
that
we
have
in
a
right
of
intervention.
and
then
what
the
government's
brief
does
not
direct
itself
to,
is
the
difference
between
intervention
in
starting
the
suit.
they
don't
mention
the
brilliant
article
by
professor
shapiro
outlining
these
all
of
many
differences
between
intervention
and
starting
a
suit.
they
don't
mention
that,
they
don't
mention
this
court's
decision
and
itself
to
be
phelps
v.
oaks,
which
goes
far
beyond
anything
we
suggest.
in
that
case,
this
court
said
that
in
the
diversity
case,
an
intervention
by
a
non-diversity
person
didn't
cause
a
loss
of
jurisdiction,
and
the
government
doesn't
mention
that.
the
government
doesn't
mention
anything
about
the
policy
of
strong
enforcement,
and
having
us
in
there
will
help
strong
enforcement,
not
weaken
it.
look
at
what
we
would
do.
first
we'll
urge
speed.
we
have
every
motivation
for
speed,
the
government
suggests
we
might
want
to
slow
it
down
or
something.
we
render
a
despicable
dictatorship
here
that
we
want
most,
is
a
speedy
decision.
we
know
the
union,
we
can
be
helpful
in
the
court
on
that.
we
know
the
violations
because
we
were
there
when
the
violations
were
occurring,
and
they
wouldn't
investigate.
we
think
it
would
improve
the
situation
to
bring
up
the
issues
of
pensions
and
bogus
locals
and
wrap
the
whole
think
up
as
in
schofields.
we
can
help
with
the
remedies,
my
goodness,
we
can't
begin
the
case.
in
other
words,
we
will
be
the
ones
who
can
help
with
this.
now
if
congress
couldn't
have
thought
that
they
wanted
a
one
sided
thing
here.
you
have
to
remember
that
boyle
is
in
that
courtroom.
the
other
side,
they
two
fractions
says
the
yablonski
fraction
and
the
boyle
fraction.
boyle
faired
that
general
counsel
of
the
union
was
the
representative
there.
but
now
they
have
new
counsel
which
was
just
happened
because
of
one
man
died,
who
was
representing
there
but
they
have
new
counsel.
the
new
counsel
have
already
been
disqualified
in
another
case
because
they
were
too
close
to
boyle,
and
i
would
like
to
call
your
honor's
attention,
we
didn't
have
time
for
reply
brief,
at
the
expedited
schedule.
but
may
i
call
your
honor's
attention
to
77
l.
r.
r.
m.
2921
where
the
new
counsel
were
disqualified
from
the
other
case
on
conflict
of
interest
because
they
are
too
close
to
boyle,
they
are
going
to
be
there,
and
if
we
are
not
there
to
get
a
wholly
one-sided
operation,
exactly
what
was
referred
to
in
cascade
about
the
danger
of
the
court
or
the
department
not
going
under.
it
will
be
a
one-sided
struggle
in
that
courtroom
with
the
yablonski
forces
totally
removed,
since
24
(a)
covers
this,
and
since
24
(a)
covers
this
like
a
blanket
or
we
conceded
it
one
time,
and
since
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
indicates
that
you
should
carve
out
this
exception,
we
respectably
submit
that
it
shouldn't
be
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
in
answer
to
the
question
placed
to
me
before
luncheon,
i
would
answer
it
this
way.
i
assume
that
the
question
doesn't
go
to
the
first
reason
for
intervention
namely
to
support
the
labor
department
in
this
suit
by
vigorous
actions.
nor
does
it
go
to
the
last
of
the
three
points
namely
on
the
remedy,
it
goes
to
the
second
point
of
our
adding
issues
and
why
can't
we
litigate
that
somewhere
else?
my
answer
to
that,
is
that
while
there
may
be
jurisdiction
to
support
the
issue
in
other
places,
it
cannot
be
in
an
election
context
because
of
section
403.
for
example,
take
the
case
of
boyle
against
blankenship,
where
the
issue
of
mr.
boyle's
misconduct
in
the
election
race
has
already
been
adjudicated,
he
has
been
removed
as
trustee
of
the
welfare
fund
because
of
his
manipulations
with
the
pension
fund
during
the
elections,
but
it
doesn't
bring
it
into
an
election
context.
so
my
answer
sir,
is
that
first,
it
doesn't
apply
to
first
our
and
third
reason.
secondly
on
the
additional
issues,
we
cannot
raise
them
in
a
context
where
they
can
be
utilized
in
the
election
suit,
and
if
i
may
add
this
point,
schofield
was
predicated
on
the
assumption
that
you
would
get
all
matters
in
one
place
that
were
appropriate
to
it.
in
fact,
the
basis
of
schofield
was
that
there
would
not
be
a
piecemeal
litigation,
and
i
suggest
the
same
thing
would
be
useful
here.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
believe
so,
yes
it
is.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes
i
believed
for
many
of
these
things,
not
all,
but
some.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no
sir,
i
don't
believe
you
have
that
any
more
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
because
anything
related
to
the
post
election
is
covered
by
section
403.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
oh,
i
am
quite
confident
of
that
sir.
if
you
would
look
at
sentence
it
says,
403,
the
remedy
provided
for
this
title
for
challenging
an
election
already
conducted
shall
be
exclusive.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
was
reading
from
the
last
sentence
of
section
403,
it
might
be
on
page
7
your
honor.
the
remedy
sir,
provided
by
this
title,
for
challenging
an
election
already
conducted
shall
be
exclusive.
i
do
not
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
if
the
remedy
is
issued
by
the
secretary
of
labors
that's
the
only
remedy
there
is.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor.
now,
coming
i
would
like--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
tracing
the
funds.
if
they
are
using
their
funds
illegally
under
section
501.
we
can
bring
suit.
we
have
a
suit
on
many
of
the
illegalities?
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no
that's
a
lmrda
action
but
it's
not
in
a
context
of
the
election.
in
other
words,
what
you
can't
do
is
bring
a
suit
to
try
to
affect
the
election
after
it's
over.
that
has
to
be
done
in
here.
and
we
have
to
come
in
here.
now
whether
we
can
raise
additional
issues
is
the
question
that
mr.
justice
white
put
to
me
and
i
believe
is
also
in
essence
of
the
question
that
you
put
to
me.
i
say
we
can
and
i
further
say
if
there's
any
question
about
it,
it
should
be
left
to
discretion
with
district
court.
and
i
finally
say
that
even
if
we
can
and
you
wont
leave
it
to
the
district
court,
it
is
only
one
of
the
three
three
reasons
why
we
say
we
shouldn’t
have
raised
it.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes
i
believe
it
would
not
be
your
honor--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
and
i
even--
yes
your
honor,
and
i
even--
and
i
point
your
attention
to
a
amendment
that
was
rejected
that
the
government
relies
on
which
is
irrelevant
to
the
point
that
they
rely
on,
but
is
relevant
here
on
page
26
of
their
brief.
they
referred
to
an
amendment
that
was
offered,
the
rights
and
remedies
provided
by
this
title
shall
be
in
addition
to
any
and
all
other
rights
and
remedies
of
law
or
inequity.
that
was
the
defeated
and
the
very
purpose
of
that
was
to
save
those
state
law
suits.
and
that
was
defeated
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
but
i
consider
that
exclusive
in
both,
in
both
state
and
the
federal
courts
--
i
am
not
saying
the
issue
can't
be
raised.
the
issue
is
raised
on
the
pension
in
a
suit
to
remove
boyle
as
trustee
and
it
happened
but
that
is
not
in
the
election
context.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
don't
believe
that
it's
possible.
i
know
of
no
case
where
it's
happened.
and
i
would
like
to
just
say
that
we
haven't
had
to
file
a
reply
brief.
we
didn't
have
time.
i
would
like
to
just
take
one
or
two
points
in
the
government's
brief
and
make
a
quick
speaking
reply.
on
page
17
of
the
government's
brief,
they
talk
about
how
we
slow
it
down
and
distort
the
planned
procedure.
i
call
your
honors
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
schofield,
the
solicitor
general's
brief
at
page
29
and
30
is
almost
the
direct
copy
of
all
terrible
things
that
would
happen,
if
people
got
in
and
you
let
us
in.
on
page
26,
i
am
at
25,
they
suggest
we
left
a
sentence
out
of
a
court
but
the
sentence
that
we
left
out
says
a
careful
reading
of
the
bill
makes
clear
that,
except
where
the
bill
provides
specifically
to
the
contrary,
certain
things.
well,
it
is
our
contention
of
course,
that
the
bill
here
does
not
specifically
provide
that
we
may
not
come
in.
on
page
26
is
the
very
statute
i
mentioned
before
which
the
government
says
has
something
to
do
with
intervention
but
in
fact
what
it
had
to
do
with
was
the
right
of
saving
your
private
rights
in
state
courts
under
state
remedies.
and
finally
on
page
28
there's
a
reference
to
mr.
cox
(ph)
who
had
a
great
deal
to
do
with
the
adoption
of
the
statute
and
mr.
cox
(ph)
in
the
full
quotation
makes
perfectly
clear
what
he's
talking
about
is
the
undesirability
of
piecemeal
litigation.
he
thinks
it
should
all
be
in
one
place
and
so
do
we.
in
conclusion,
i
just
like
to
say
that
leaders
and
members
of
minors
for
democracy,
the
yablonski
fraction
have
risked
much
in
this
struggle.
this
suit
is
at
the
height
of
that
struggle.
nothing
has
been
shown
to
evidence
congressional
intent
to
keep
us
from
the
district
court
courtroom
and
we
would
urge
your
honors
to
get
us
there
promptly.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i'm
not
suggesting
anything
your
honor.
i
think
that
would
be
presumptuous
of
me
and
i
am
trying
to
be
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no
sir,
it
is
not
being
held
pending
your
decision.
what
happened
sir,
was
that
they
were
trying,
start
on
september
13th.
the
government
asked
for
a
delay
so
they
could
do
some
work
on
their
case.
while
that
delay
was
in
effect
counsel
for
the
mine
workers
died,
so
they
postponed
it
for
that
reason,
new
counsel
has
been
obtained.
i
explained
your
honor
this
morning
that
the
new
counsel
was
that
counsel
who
had
been
excluded
from
the
501
case
by
virtue
of
being
too
close
to
boyle
but
they
will
be
there,
and
we
want
to
be
there
too.
but
as
far
as
the
date
is
concerned,
well,
of
course,
i
have
been
presumptions
for
me
to
tell
you
and
i
am
trying
to
tell
you
how,
but
i
wouldn't
be
presumptuous
to
tell
you
when.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
may
i
please
the
court.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
thank
you
sir.
the
learned
solicitor
general
has
demonstrated
that
we
can
start
suit,
and
when
he
says
that
the
bill
passed
the
house
the
way
we
see,
it
didn't
pass
the
house
the
way
we
see.
it
passed
the
house
saying
the
individual
could
start
the
suit.
nobody
ever
considered
the
position
we
take
and
–
that
the
secretary
can
start
the
suit
but
intervention
under
24
(a)
is
something
else.
i
would
not
have
raised
the
question
that
the
secretary
is
vigorously
opposing
the
umwa.
but
since
mr.
learned
solicitor
general
raised
that
issue,
i
have
to
state
to
the
court
that
in
our
opinion,
the
case
is
not
being
prosecuted
with
the
vigor
it
should.
i
simply
make
the
point,
i
have
refrained
from
saying
that
but
i
cannot
let
the
record
stand
with
only
the
solicitor
general's
statement
that
the
secretary
is
so
prosecuting
of
what
we
feel
so
strongly
that
it
is
not.
most
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
precisely
sir,
however,
we
don't
need
that
point.
we
have
private
rights
and
the
solicitor
general
in
oral
argument,
did
not
suggest
that
we
don't
have
private
rights.
he
suggested
that
under
24
(a),
he
was
arguing
that
the
word
exclusive
prevents
intervention
although
it
doesn't
say
it,
but
we
have
private
rights
and
we
are
entitled
to
represent
those
rights
because
the
secretary
doesn't
even
claim
he
is
representing
those
rights,
all
applied
from
the
fact
that
we
do
not
agree
that
the
case
is
being
vigorously
presented.
i
only
answered
it
because
i
didn't
want
the
record
to
stand
one
way
on
that
matter.
i
don't
think
it
is
important.
now
mr.
solicitor
general
states
the
union
disputants
could
intervene
on
both
sides,
but
the
union
disputant
is
there
on
one
side,
that's
what
the
point
is,
mr.
boyle
is
in
the
courtroom
and
we
are
not.
it's
as
simple
as
that.
it
would
be
one
thing
if
counsel
--
for
mr.
boyle,
counsel
for
the
union
were
independent,
mr.
boyle
but
it's
mr.
boyle's
counsel,
they
are
fighting
for
mr.
boyle
and
we
are
not
there.
it
would
be
absolutely
hopeless
that
the
case
could
be
a
straight
down
the
middle,
judge
brieant
has
the
advantage
of
boyle
in
the
courtroom,
he
doesn't
have
the
advantage
of
the
yablonski.
now,
finally
and
most
importantly,
on
rebuttal,
this
idea
that
we
could
start
a
suit
for
the
fourth
coming
election,
now
if
your
honors,
please
would
you
look
at
item
e
of
section
402,
it's
on
our
brief,
for
example,
at
the
bottom
of
page
6.
it
says,
if
upon
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
the
court
finds
that
there
should
be
a
new
election,
the
court
shall
declare
the
election
if
any
to
be
void
and
direct
the
conduct
of
a
new
election.
now,
how
on
heaven's
name
can
we
start
a
suit
after
that?
you
will
have
a
decree
giving
the
conditions
of
the
new
election.
what
would
time
period
be,
a
couple
of
months?
the
desire
of
congress
for
speed
is
evidenced
by
a
provision
in
402
(d)
that
there
can't
even
be
a
state
pending
appeal.
the
minute
the
district
judge
enters
the
order,
saying
that
there
is
to
be
a
new
election
and
enters
a
decree
giving
the
conditions
of
that
new
election,
it
will
be
held,
the
suggestion
that
we
then
start
a
suit
about
a
forthcoming
election,
and
a
election
that
can't
be
stayed
is
just
impractical
and
unrealistic.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
if
we
can't
get
there,
we
can't
go
anywhere.
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
courts
below
held
the
petitioner,
the
head
of
the
reform
group,
within
the
united
mine
workers
could
not
intervene
in
the
secretory
of
labor
suit
to
upset
the
1969
union
election
in
which
petitioner
and
his
reform
group
have
an
intense
interest.
the
question
here
on
certiorari
is
whether
the
courts
below
erred
heard
in
beholding
that
the
labor
management
reporting
and
disclosure
act
carves
an
exception
out
of
rule
24
(a)
and
thus
bars
the
intervention
of
petitioner's
reform
group.
on
may
29th,
1969,
mr
joseph
yablonski
announced
that
he
would
run
for
president
of
the
united
mine
workers
of
america.
between
may
29th
and
december
9th
of
1969,
the
date
of
the
election,
yablonski
was
forced
to
bring
five
lawsuits.
in
three
of
these,
we
got
our
preliminary
injunctions
giving
us
the
right
to
mail
out
literature,
getting
yablonski's
job
back
after
he
was
fired
in
reprisal
firing
and
stopping
the
journal,
the
united
mine
workers
journal
from
being
used
as
campaign
literature.
in
one
of
the
five
suits,
we
didn't
get
an
order
but
the
--
before
that
the
mine
workers
had
done
in
court
what
we
asked
for,
namely
to
tell
what
rules
of
the
election
would
be.
in
the
fifth
suit
which
was
a
suit
to
make
to
mr.
bloch
and
the
others
payback
what
they
have
taken
from
the
union
is
still
pending.
now
in
addition
to
these
lawsuits,
mr.
yablonski
also
sought
an
investigation
by
the
secretory
of
labor
of
the
massive
violations
going
on
during
the
election
but
despite
the
clear
language
in
section
601
of
the
lmrda
and
despite
this
court's
statement
in
footnote
5
in
the
labors
case
that
section
601
applied
here
and
he
could
investigate
and
despite
the
fact
that
we
detailed
the
violations
of
law,
the
secretory
of
labor
refused
to
make
any
investigation.
so
there
came
december
9th
and
the
incumbents
declared
themselves
elected.
two
points
might
be
mentioned
on
this
election,
first,
what
we
had
poll
watchers,
we
either
broke
even
or
one
where
we
didn't
--
we
lost
by
margins
up
to
50
to
1,
second,
as
was
found
by
the
subcommittee
on
labor,
the
decision
was
made
by
pensioners
because
they
voted
largely
voted
for
them
--
93%
voted
for
mr.
bloch.
on
december
18th,
nine
days
after
the
election,
mr.
yablonski
challenged
the
election
detailing
to
the
labor
department,
these
massive
violations.
on
january
5th,
mr.
yablonski
was
found
dead.
on
jan
20th,
the
petitioner
adopted
the
challenge,
he
had
been
mr.
yablonski's
campaign
manager
and
he
took
over
the
challenge
of
the
election.
on
march
5th,
the
secretory
of
labor
brought
the
suit
based
on
petitioner’s
challenge.
on
april
1st,
1970,
minors
for
democracy,
the
yablonski
reform
group,
was
formed.
on
october
2nd,
when
no
progress
had
been
made
in
the
suit
and
answer
hadn’t
even
been
filed,
we
moved
to
intervene.
we
saw
three
things
then
and
now
as
our
intervention,
that
is
we
seek
to
do
three
things
by
intervening.
first,
to
assure
that
the
violations
asserted
by
the
secretory
of
labor
are
speedily
and
vigorously
presented
to
the
court.
second,
to
raise
two
additional
grounds
for
upsetting
the
election,
namely
that
mr.
bloch
by
his
illegal
pension
increase
had
engaged
in
improper
interference
with
the
election
and
second
the
voting
through
illegal
locals
had
made
it
easy
for
them
to
steal
the
election,
i
referred
at
the
pension
vote
because
the
illegal
locals
are
pension
locals.
third
to
append
a
district
court
decree,
ensuring
that
the
new
election
would
not
be
a
repeat
of
the
last
one.
in
other
words,
we
seek
to
do
three
things
to
assist
and
push
the
secretory
of
labor
to
prove
what
he
has
set
out
to
prove,
to
add
two
issues
and
to
see
that
there
is
a
decree,
so
there
won't
be
a
repeat.
the
district
court
said
no
to
our
intervention,
he
said
at
page
112
of
the
appendix
that
the
landrum-griffin
act
deprived
the
court
of
jurisdiction
to
permit
our
intervention.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
without
opinion.
the
case
is
here
on
an
expedited
schedule
because
the
case
is
in
trial
below,
this
is
the
status
below.
on
september
13th
of
this
year
the
trial
started.
after
about
5
weeks
of
trial,
it
went
into
recess,
it
reconvenes
this
coming
monday,
november
22nd,
for
the
completion
of
the
government’s
case.
if
we
are
permitted
to
intervene,
we
will
not
make
any
delays,
we
are
not
going
to
ask
for
discovery,
in
fact,
i
hereby
waive
discovery,
so
that
we
can
go
right
into
the
case
as
it
is
and
we
will
go
on
with
our
case
promptly.
so
in
other
words,
there's
no
question
of
the
delays
through
our
intervention.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no
sir,
it's
in
front
of
judge
brian.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
two
issues
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
it's
different
from
hodgson.
you
said
that,
they
couldn't
add
in
hogdson,
as
i
know
you
didn’t
the
court
said,
they
couldn’t
add
in
hodgson
because
it
hadn’t
been
in
the
petitioner’s
--
in
the
complaint
--
in
the
charge.
here
it's
in
the
charge
and
question
is
whether
it
can
go
in
now
that
he
went
ahead.
so
that
that,
that
problem
is
up
but
it
is
a
different
question
than
hodgson--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
that's
correct
your
honor
and
therefore
the--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
precisely,
we
believe
--
that's
precisely
correct
your
honor,
we
believe
that
we
are
entitled
to
raise
those
two
issues,
and
that
there
is
--
because
he
has
found
probable
cause.
therefore,
once
we
get
in,
we
ought
to
raise
it,
we
ought
to
elaborate
it;
secondly
we
feel
less
should
be
left
to
the
district
court
who
has
control
of
how
broadly
intervention
would
go
and
third
we
say,
well,
if
you
we
should
not,
i
don't
know,
it
doesn't
seem
why
we
shouldn't
be
in
the
case.
and
therefore,
i
would
make
it
in
that
order.
now,
first,
we
meet
the
requirements
of
rule
24
(a)
it
fits
us
like
a
glove,
indeed
in
the
lower
court,
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
government
conceded.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
judge
right
asked
mr.
battochi
was
arguing
for
the
government
whether
we
didn't
meet
rule
24
(a)
and
whether
his
whole
argument
wasn't
that
the
lmrda
sued
at
us
and
he
said
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
at
this
moment,
i
cannot
say
that
in
their
opposition
to
cert,
they
said
that
the
secretory
hadn't
--
then
we
pointed
out
that
it
had
been
done
in
open
court
and
in
their
brief
they
don't
mention
it
so
i
suppose
it's
conceded
that
this
happened.
we
heard
with
our
own
ears.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
they
have
a
record
sir
but
we
don't
have
access
to
that,
to
the
court
of
appeal's
record,
i
think
it's
like
a
record
that
you
all
make
but
i
don't
think
that
will
challenge
there
that
mr.
battochi
said,
conceded
but
they
can
withdraw
the
confession,
i
mean
i
am
not
arguing
that
you
can't
withdraw
a
confession
sometime
during
the
case.
i
didn't
look
up
the
law
of
confessions
because
i
am
really
not
relying
on
it.
what
i
am
relying
upon
is
the
fact
that
it's
so
clear
that
we
are
in
-
that
we
meet
rule
24
(a).
that
they
even--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
intervention
of
right
and--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
precisely
you
honor
and
for
example,
our
interest
is
obvious,
our
whole
life
depends
on
the
outcome
of
this
election.
the
only
question
that
the
government
raises
while
we
don't
meet
rule
24
(a).
now
that
the
confession
has
been
withdrawn,
is
that,
they
adequately
represented
but
they
base
that
on
the
fact
that
they
say
there
are
no
private
rights
but
your
honor,
as
i
have
made
clear
in
both
the
labors
and
in
the
glass
bottle
blowers
case
that
they
are
both,
that
there
are
private
rights,
and
public
rights.
indeed
strangely
enough
the
government,
at
page
33
of
their
brief
cites
to
this
proposition
of
no
private
rights.
the
case
that
refers
to
private
rights.
at
the
bottom
of
page
33,
the
government
says,
in
the
words
of
this
court,
“the
act
was
not
designed
both
merely
to
protect
the
right
of
a
union
member
to
run
for
a
particular
office
in
a
particular
election.”
they
asserted
a
vital
public
interest.
well,
of
course,
i
will
be
the
last
person
to
say,
there
isn't
a
great
public
interest
here,
but
there
is
such
an
obvious
private
right.
it's
exactly
like
the
parallel
case
of
schofield,
where
this
court
unanimously
referred
to
the
inter-blending
of
public
and
private
rights.
the
same
inter-blending
of
public
and
private
rights
that
you
have
at
the
labor
board,
you
have
here.
now,
if
there
are
any
inter-blending
of
public
and
private
rights
which
seems
to
me
obvious
then,
we
are
the
only
one
to
protect
the
private
rights.
the
secretary
doesn’t
even
claim
to
protect
the
private
rights,
he
says,
they
aren't
any.
so
i
am
not
--
there
is
a
tremendous
hostility
between
the
labor
department,
and
our
side.
we
do
not
however
have
to
rely
on
that.
i
am
not
relying
on
that
to
show
we're
not
adequately
represented.
i
rely
on
this
very
simple
propositions,
that
the
landrum-griffin
act,
as
this
court
held,
setup
both
public
and
private
rights,
and
that
we
are
properly
to
protect
the
private
rights.
now
as
mr.
justice
white
said,
you
may
not
be
able
to
get
everything
in
there
that
you
want
to
protect
those
private
rights,
that
may,
we
argue
the
other
side,
we
are
still
the
person
to
protect
the
private
rights
insofar
as
the
district
court
in
supervising
would
permit.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
and
therefore,
the
remedy
and
the
issues
do
come
together.
that's
quite
correct,
sir,
in
the
remedy
point,
that
we
want
to
be
in
on
you
will
get
the
problem
on
the
issues
themselves
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes
sir,
precisely.
now,
assuming
there
are
private
rights
as
to
which
have
a
right
to
protect
them
under
24
(a),
and
we
meet
24
(a),
then
the
question
comes
down,
does
landrum-griffin
carve
out
an
exception
to
24(a),
does
it
say,
it
can't
get
in?
now
the
government's
brief
demonstrates
beyond
peradventure
of
doubt
what
no
one
challenges,
namely
that
we
can't
start
the
suit.
of
course
we
can't
start
the
suit,
section
403
and
the
landrum-griffin
says
it's
a
exclusive
right
of
the
secretory,
but
proving
that
we
can't
start
the
suit,
has
nothing
to
do
with
proving
that
we
have
in
a
right
of
intervention.
and
then
what
the
government's
brief
does
not
direct
itself
to,
is
the
difference
between
intervention
in
starting
the
suit.
they
don't
mention
the
brilliant
article
by
professor
shapiro
outlining
these
all
of
many
differences
between
intervention
and
starting
a
suit.
they
don't
mention
that,
they
don't
mention
this
court's
decision
and
itself
to
be
phelps
v.
oaks,
which
goes
far
beyond
anything
we
suggest.
in
that
case,
this
court
said
that
in
the
diversity
case,
an
intervention
by
a
non-diversity
person
didn't
cause
a
loss
of
jurisdiction,
and
the
government
doesn't
mention
that.
the
government
doesn't
mention
anything
about
the
policy
of
strong
enforcement,
and
having
us
in
there
will
help
strong
enforcement,
not
weaken
it.
look
at
what
we
would
do.
first
we'll
urge
speed.
we
have
every
motivation
for
speed,
the
government
suggests
we
might
want
to
slow
it
down
or
something.
we
render
a
despicable
dictatorship
here
that
we
want
most,
is
a
speedy
decision.
we
know
the
union,
we
can
be
helpful
in
the
court
on
that.
we
know
the
violations
because
we
were
there
when
the
violations
were
occurring,
and
they
wouldn't
investigate.
we
think
it
would
improve
the
situation
to
bring
up
the
issues
of
pensions
and
bogus
locals
and
wrap
the
whole
think
up
as
in
schofields.
we
can
help
with
the
remedies,
my
goodness,
we
can't
begin
the
case.
in
other
words,
we
will
be
the
ones
who
can
help
with
this.
now
if
congress
couldn't
have
thought
that
they
wanted
a
one
sided
thing
here.
you
have
to
remember
that
boyle
is
in
that
courtroom.
the
other
side,
they
two
fractions
says
the
yablonski
fraction
and
the
boyle
fraction.
boyle
faired
that
general
counsel
of
the
union
was
the
representative
there.
but
now
they
have
new
counsel
which
was
just
happened
because
of
one
man
died,
who
was
representing
there
but
they
have
new
counsel.
the
new
counsel
have
already
been
disqualified
in
another
case
because
they
were
too
close
to
boyle,
and
i
would
like
to
call
your
honor's
attention,
we
didn't
have
time
for
reply
brief,
at
the
expedited
schedule.
but
may
i
call
your
honor's
attention
to
77
l.
r.
r.
m.
2921
where
the
new
counsel
were
disqualified
from
the
other
case
on
conflict
of
interest
because
they
are
too
close
to
boyle,
they
are
going
to
be
there,
and
if
we
are
not
there
to
get
a
wholly
one-sided
operation,
exactly
what
was
referred
to
in
cascade
about
the
danger
of
the
court
or
the
department
not
going
under.
it
will
be
a
one-sided
struggle
in
that
courtroom
with
the
yablonski
forces
totally
removed,
since
24
(a)
covers
this,
and
since
24
(a)
covers
this
like
a
blanket
or
we
conceded
it
one
time,
and
since
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
indicates
that
you
should
carve
out
this
exception,
we
respectably
submit
that
it
shouldn't
be
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
in
answer
to
the
question
placed
to
me
before
luncheon,
i
would
answer
it
this
way.
i
assume
that
the
question
doesn't
go
to
the
first
reason
for
intervention
namely
to
support
the
labor
department
in
this
suit
by
vigorous
actions.
nor
does
it
go
to
the
last
of
the
three
points
namely
on
the
remedy,
it
goes
to
the
second
point
of
our
adding
issues
and
why
can't
we
litigate
that
somewhere
else?
my
answer
to
that,
is
that
while
there
may
be
jurisdiction
to
support
the
issue
in
other
places,
it
cannot
be
in
an
election
context
because
of
section
403.
for
example,
take
the
case
of
boyle
against
blankenship,
where
the
issue
of
mr.
boyle's
misconduct
in
the
election
race
has
already
been
adjudicated,
he
has
been
removed
as
trustee
of
the
welfare
fund
because
of
his
manipulations
with
the
pension
fund
during
the
elections,
but
it
doesn't
bring
it
into
an
election
context.
so
my
answer
sir,
is
that
first,
it
doesn't
apply
to
first
our
and
third
reason.
secondly
on
the
additional
issues,
we
cannot
raise
them
in
a
context
where
they
can
be
utilized
in
the
election
suit,
and
if
i
may
add
this
point,
schofield
was
predicated
on
the
assumption
that
you
would
get
all
matters
in
one
place
that
were
appropriate
to
it.
in
fact,
the
basis
of
schofield
was
that
there
would
not
be
a
piecemeal
litigation,
and
i
suggest
the
same
thing
would
be
useful
here.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
believe
so,
yes
it
is.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes
i
believed
for
many
of
these
things,
not
all,
but
some.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no
sir,
i
don't
believe
you
have
that
any
more
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
because
anything
related
to
the
post
election
is
covered
by
section
403.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
oh,
i
am
quite
confident
of
that
sir.
if
you
would
look
at
sentence
it
says,
403,
the
remedy
provided
for
this
title
for
challenging
an
election
already
conducted
shall
be
exclusive.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
was
reading
from
the
last
sentence
of
section
403,
it
might
be
on
page
7
your
honor.
the
remedy
sir,
provided
by
this
title,
for
challenging
an
election
already
conducted
shall
be
exclusive.
i
do
not
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
if
the
remedy
is
issued
by
the
secretary
of
labors
that's
the
only
remedy
there
is.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor.
now,
coming
i
would
like--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
tracing
the
funds.
if
they
are
using
their
funds
illegally
under
section
501.
we
can
bring
suit.
we
have
a
suit
on
many
of
the
illegalities?
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no
that's
a
lmrda
action
but
it's
not
in
a
context
of
the
election.
in
other
words,
what
you
can't
do
is
bring
a
suit
to
try
to
affect
the
election
after
it's
over.
that
has
to
be
done
in
here.
and
we
have
to
come
in
here.
now
whether
we
can
raise
additional
issues
is
the
question
that
mr.
justice
white
put
to
me
and
i
believe
is
also
in
essence
of
the
question
that
you
put
to
me.
i
say
we
can
and
i
further
say
if
there's
any
question
about
it,
it
should
be
left
to
discretion
with
district
court.
and
i
finally
say
that
even
if
we
can
and
you
wont
leave
it
to
the
district
court,
it
is
only
one
of
the
three
three
reasons
why
we
say
we
shouldn’t
have
raised
it.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes
i
believe
it
would
not
be
your
honor--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
and
i
even--
yes
your
honor,
and
i
even--
and
i
point
your
attention
to
a
amendment
that
was
rejected
that
the
government
relies
on
which
is
irrelevant
to
the
point
that
they
rely
on,
but
is
relevant
here
on
page
26
of
their
brief.
they
referred
to
an
amendment
that
was
offered,
the
rights
and
remedies
provided
by
this
title
shall
be
in
addition
to
any
and
all
other
rights
and
remedies
of
law
or
inequity.
that
was
the
defeated
and
the
very
purpose
of
that
was
to
save
those
state
law
suits.
and
that
was
defeated
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
but
i
consider
that
exclusive
in
both,
in
both
state
and
the
federal
courts
--
i
am
not
saying
the
issue
can't
be
raised.
the
issue
is
raised
on
the
pension
in
a
suit
to
remove
boyle
as
trustee
and
it
happened
but
that
is
not
in
the
election
context.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
don't
believe
that
it's
possible.
i
know
of
no
case
where
it's
happened.
and
i
would
like
to
just
say
that
we
haven't
had
to
file
a
reply
brief.
we
didn't
have
time.
i
would
like
to
just
take
one
or
two
points
in
the
government's
brief
and
make
a
quick
speaking
reply.
on
page
17
of
the
government's
brief,
they
talk
about
how
we
slow
it
down
and
distort
the
planned
procedure.
i
call
your
honors
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
schofield,
the
solicitor
general's
brief
at
page
29
and
30
is
almost
the
direct
copy
of
all
terrible
things
that
would
happen,
if
people
got
in
and
you
let
us
in.
on
page
26,
i
am
at
25,
they
suggest
we
left
a
sentence
out
of
a
court
but
the
sentence
that
we
left
out
says
a
careful
reading
of
the
bill
makes
clear
that,
except
where
the
bill
provides
specifically
to
the
contrary,
certain
things.
well,
it
is
our
contention
of
course,
that
the
bill
here
does
not
specifically
provide
that
we
may
not
come
in.
on
page
26
is
the
very
statute
i
mentioned
before
which
the
government
says
has
something
to
do
with
intervention
but
in
fact
what
it
had
to
do
with
was
the
right
of
saving
your
private
rights
in
state
courts
under
state
remedies.
and
finally
on
page
28
there's
a
reference
to
mr.
cox
(ph)
who
had
a
great
deal
to
do
with
the
adoption
of
the
statute
and
mr.
cox
(ph)
in
the
full
quotation
makes
perfectly
clear
what
he's
talking
about
is
the
undesirability
of
piecemeal
litigation.
he
thinks
it
should
all
be
in
one
place
and
so
do
we.
in
conclusion,
i
just
like
to
say
that
leaders
and
members
of
minors
for
democracy,
the
yablonski
fraction
have
risked
much
in
this
struggle.
this
suit
is
at
the
height
of
that
struggle.
nothing
has
been
shown
to
evidence
congressional
intent
to
keep
us
from
the
district
court
courtroom
and
we
would
urge
your
honors
to
get
us
there
promptly.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i'm
not
suggesting
anything
your
honor.
i
think
that
would
be
presumptuous
of
me
and
i
am
trying
to
be
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no
sir,
it
is
not
being
held
pending
your
decision.
what
happened
sir,
was
that
they
were
trying,
start
on
september
13th.
the
government
asked
for
a
delay
so
they
could
do
some
work
on
their
case.
while
that
delay
was
in
effect
counsel
for
the
mine
workers
died,
so
they
postponed
it
for
that
reason,
new
counsel
has
been
obtained.
i
explained
your
honor
this
morning
that
the
new
counsel
was
that
counsel
who
had
been
excluded
from
the
501
case
by
virtue
of
being
too
close
to
boyle
but
they
will
be
there,
and
we
want
to
be
there
too.
but
as
far
as
the
date
is
concerned,
well,
of
course,
i
have
been
presumptions
for
me
to
tell
you
and
i
am
trying
to
tell
you
how,
but
i
wouldn't
be
presumptuous
to
tell
you
when.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
may
i
please
the
court.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
thank
you
sir.
the
learned
solicitor
general
has
demonstrated
that
we
can
start
suit,
and
when
he
says
that
the
bill
passed
the
house
the
way
we
see,
it
didn't
pass
the
house
the
way
we
see.
it
passed
the
house
saying
the
individual
could
start
the
suit.
nobody
ever
considered
the
position
we
take
and
–
that
the
secretary
can
start
the
suit
but
intervention
under
24
(a)
is
something
else.
i
would
not
have
raised
the
question
that
the
secretary
is
vigorously
opposing
the
umwa.
but
since
mr.
learned
solicitor
general
raised
that
issue,
i
have
to
state
to
the
court
that
in
our
opinion,
the
case
is
not
being
prosecuted
with
the
vigor
it
should.
i
simply
make
the
point,
i
have
refrained
from
saying
that
but
i
cannot
let
the
record
stand
with
only
the
solicitor
general's
statement
that
the
secretary
is
so
prosecuting
of
what
we
feel
so
strongly
that
it
is
not.
most
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
precisely
sir,
however,
we
don't
need
that
point.
we
have
private
rights
and
the
solicitor
general
in
oral
argument,
did
not
suggest
that
we
don't
have
private
rights.
he
suggested
that
under
24
(a),
he
was
arguing
that
the
word
exclusive
prevents
intervention
although
it
doesn't
say
it,
but
we
have
private
rights
and
we
are
entitled
to
represent
those
rights
because
the
secretary
doesn't
even
claim
he
is
representing
those
rights,
all
applied
from
the
fact
that
we
do
not
agree
that
the
case
is
being
vigorously
presented.
i
only
answered
it
because
i
didn't
want
the
record
to
stand
one
way
on
that
matter.
i
don't
think
it
is
important.
now
mr.
solicitor
general
states
the
union
disputants
could
intervene
on
both
sides,
but
the
union
disputant
is
there
on
one
side,
that's
what
the
point
is,
mr.
boyle
is
in
the
courtroom
and
we
are
not.
it's
as
simple
as
that.
it
would
be
one
thing
if
counsel
--
for
mr.
boyle,
counsel
for
the
union
were
independent,
mr.
boyle
but
it's
mr.
boyle's
counsel,
they
are
fighting
for
mr.
boyle
and
we
are
not
there.
it
would
be
absolutely
hopeless
that
the
case
could
be
a
straight
down
the
middle,
judge
brieant
has
the
advantage
of
boyle
in
the
courtroom,
he
doesn't
have
the
advantage
of
the
yablonski.
now,
finally
and
most
importantly,
on
rebuttal,
this
idea
that
we
could
start
a
suit
for
the
fourth
coming
election,
now
if
your
honors,
please
would
you
look
at
item
e
of
section
402,
it's
on
our
brief,
for
example,
at
the
bottom
of
page
6.
it
says,
if
upon
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
the
court
finds
that
there
should
be
a
new
election,
the
court
shall
declare
the
election
if
any
to
be
void
and
direct
the
conduct
of
a
new
election.
now,
how
on
heaven's
name
can
we
start
a
suit
after
that?
you
will
have
a
decree
giving
the
conditions
of
the
new
election.
what
would
time
period
be,
a
couple
of
months?
the
desire
of
congress
for
speed
is
evidenced
by
a
provision
in
402
(d)
that
there
can't
even
be
a
state
pending
appeal.
the
minute
the
district
judge
enters
the
order,
saying
that
there
is
to
be
a
new
election
and
enters
a
decree
giving
the
conditions
of
that
new
election,
it
will
be
held,
the
suggestion
that
we
then
start
a
suit
about
a
forthcoming
election,
and
a
election
that
can't
be
stayed
is
just
impractical
and
unrealistic.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
if
we
can't
get
there,
we
can't
go
anywhere.
thank
you.
