you
still

not

justice

stewart
mr
rauh,
i'm
puzzled
why
you
should
suggest
that
last
sentence
of
403
necessarily
bars
a
state
action
on
grounds
that
will
not
be
heard
in
this
suit,
simply
if
these
were
grounds
which
had
not
been
included
in
the
original
complaint
that
is
the
intra-union
thing
under
hudson.
would
you
still
say
that
as
to
those
is
a
secretary
now,
under
hudson
may
not
press
in
the
law
suit.
that
they
would
not
be
the
basis
of
a
state
action.
justice
potter
stewart
my
reason
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
or
may
be
in
the
state
courts?
justice
potter
stewart
my
question
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr
rauh,
did
you
say
that
this
trial
scheduled
to
resume
by
monday?
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
suggesting
that
we
decide
these
things?
justice
potter
stewart
well
is
it
being
held
pending
our
--
justice
potter
stewart
can
i
ask
you
mr.
solicitor?
i
take
it,
the
trial
judge
is
rather
in
the
dilemma
and
so
we
decided?
justice
potter
stewart
i
gather
mr.
rauh
once
more
than
just
to
present
that
material,
he
wants
to
fight
on
the
side
of
the
secretary.
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
no
jury
involved.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
gather
mr.
solicitor,
does
that
position
take
you
to
the
point
however
inadequate?
let's
assume
maybe
the
representation
of
the
secretary
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
wasn't
thinking
so
much
of
that
is,
in
this
case
mr.
rauh
urges
on
us
that
there
are
two
question,
two
issues
that
that
side
thinks
ought
to
be
submitted
and
litigated,
and
that
i
gather
are
not
to
be.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
have
agreed
with
him
that
the
last
sentence
for
403
precludes
their
seeking
a
remedy
anywhere
else
with
respect
to
this
election.
justice
potter
stewart
were
these
two
issues
that
they
want
litigated
in
this
action?
aren't
they
addressed
to
setting
aside
the
past
election?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
get
to.
i
gather
then
that
as
to
this
past
election
those
two
grounds
may
not
be
asserted
anywhere.
justice
potter
stewart
doesn't
that
suggest
that
there
is
at
least
a
question
under
the
last
sentence
of
24,
unless
the
applicant's
interest
is
adequately
represented
by
existing
court?
justice
potter
stewart
i
might
rule

isn’t
