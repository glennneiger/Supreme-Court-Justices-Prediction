mr.
harfield,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready?
chief

e.

mr.
harfield,
historically,
where
did
the
act
of
state
doctrine
originate,
in
the
courts
or
in
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
suggestion
from
what
source?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
it’s
a
doctrine
of
committee,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it’s
not
between
the
branches?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
governments.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
internally
within
our
own
framework,
it
is
a
doctrine
of
committee
of
the
court’s
giving
deference
to
the
overwriting
responsibilities
of
the
executive
in
relation
to
foreign
policies,
is
that
not
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
it
makes
any
difference
that
this
security
that
you
hold
was
not
part
of
any
security
transaction
that
relates
to
the
expropriation
in
cuba?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
harfield.
mr.
rabinowitz.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
perhaps,
it
might
not
unreasonable
to
ask
them
if
your
position
is
that
this
is
just
to
go
into
the
pool.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
in
that
case
then,
why
is
the
cuban
banks
are
concerned
about
this?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
can
understand,
your
not
wanting
to
speculate
about
the
policies
of
your
client
too
because
that
involves
the
a
matter
of
your
client’s
foreign
policy
but
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
care
to
speculate
on
why
the
courts
remanded
the
case
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
consideration
of
the
state
department’s
view.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
hasn’t
been
here
that
executive
branch
indicated
that
they
would
prefer
to
have
judicial
branch
just
to
go
ahead
and
decide
this
lawsuit?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
rabinowitz.
mr.
harfield,
you
have
five
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
didn’t
think
there
was
much
doubt
about
that.
mr.
rabinowitz
said
you
did
not
want
to
get
into
discussing
his
plans
foreign
policy
and
i
don’t
assume
banks
in
cuba
have
foreign
policy.
so
i
don’t
think
we
need
to
dwell
much
on
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
have
notice
of
the
sovereign
ever
--
can
the
motives
of
a
sovereign
ever
be
called
in
the
question
in
an
expropriation?
is
it
not
only
--
is
it
not
just
the
value
of
the
property
that’s
involved?
chief

you
mr.
