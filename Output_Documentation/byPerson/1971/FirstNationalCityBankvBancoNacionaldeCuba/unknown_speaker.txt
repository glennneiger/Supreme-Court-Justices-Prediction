unknown
speaker
let
me
go
back
then
to
my
previous
question,
what
is
and
i
ask
this
for
instruction.
what
is
the
usual
routine
when
assets
are
frozen
under
circumstances
of
this
kind?
are
claims
are
eventually
filed
and
then
the
frozen
assets
perhaps
allocated
among
those
claims
that
are
allowed?
unknown
speaker
but
the
court
of
appeals
vote
in
the
case
of
an
underground
which
is
due.
unknown
speaker
temporary
issues?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
i
agree
with
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
rabinowitz.
unknown
speaker
it’s
my
understanding
both
from
the
courts
below
and
from
one
of
the
briefs
here
that
the
act
of
state
doctrine
is
an
exception
to
the
general
rule
of
the
paquete
habana
that
generally
courts
of
the
united
states
do
decide
questions
of
international
aw
unless
the
act
of
state
doctrine
exception
applies.
you’re
not
suggesting
that
the
act
of
state
doctrine
is
simply
swallow
up
that
general
rule,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
you’re
limiting
it
to
questions
of
the
validity
of
the
laws
of
foreign
governments?
unknown
speaker
mr.
rabinowitz,
in
connection
with
the
hickenlooper
amendment,
if
we
had
a
case
here
that
clearly
and
admittedly
tell
within
the
scope
of
the
hickenlooper
amendment
so
that
if
you
can
imagine
one
of
the
point
which
you
would
not
disagree.
would
your
argument
be
that
the
amendment
is
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
and
that
you
must
in
order
to
sustain
position
you
have
already
stated
i
take
it
--
unknown
speaker
because
you
could
not
accept
congress’
direction
for
the
courts
to
as
you
would
put
it
in
they
'll
be
severely
even.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
if
it
isn’t,
then
it
is
rather
relevant
to
this
case
even
if
it
does
not
apply,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
it’s
a
rather
a
vast
fundamental
expression
by
congress
to
the
relationship
between
courts
and
the
executive
of
what
the
judicial
job
is
for
example.
unknown
speaker
now,
other
cases
in
which
even
more
severely
might
represent
some
threat
to
the
foreign
policy.
unknown
speaker
yes,
it
would
look
like
cop.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
one
question
mr.
rabinowitz,
do
you
say
that
bernstein
is
inconsistent
with
sabbatino
and
most
of
them
are
disapproved
by
implication
in
sabbatino?
unknown
speaker
mr.
rabinowitz,
did
you
go
into
the
--
give
your
view
of
what
the
legality
of
an
international
law
discriminatory
expropriation?
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
the
same
thing
in
sabbatino?
unknown
speaker
well
anyway
--
unknown
speaker
anyway,
you
did
not
address
yourself
to
that
issue.
