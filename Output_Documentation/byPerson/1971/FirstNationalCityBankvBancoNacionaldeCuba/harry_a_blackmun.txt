mr.
harfield,
just
as
a
matter
of
practicality,
suppose
that
the
respondent
prevails
here,
what
happens
to
the
$2
million?
justice

well,
does
banco
nacional
get
the
$2
million?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
just
as
this
is
to
which
my
question
is
directed?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
my
next
question
would
be,
why
is
the
respondent
fighting
so
hard
for
it?
and
perhaps,
that’s
a
question
i
will
ask
mr.
rabinowitz
rather
to
you.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
of
course,
looking
in
the
background
are
the
other
claimants
who
profess
to
be
victims
of
cuban
expropriation
aren’t
they?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
i
suppose
it’s
their
position
that
if
you
prevail
here,
city

enjoying
a
windfall?
