justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
harfield,
under
rule
13,
my
understanding
is
that
counterclaims
are
limited
that
those
against
the
opposing
party
and
here
as
i
understand,
banco
nacional
was
the
plaintiff
and
you
have
asserted
a
counterclaim,
but
basically
as
i
understand
goes
against
the
government
of
cuba
rather
than
banco
nacional,
and
the
district
court
ruled
in
your
favor
on
summary
judgment
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
pass
on
the
district
court
ruling.
do
you
contend
here
that
that
was
a
proper
summary
adjudication
in
the
district
court
that
they
weren’t
the
same?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
what
basis?
