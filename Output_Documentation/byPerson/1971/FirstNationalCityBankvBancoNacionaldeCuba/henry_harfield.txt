mr.
henry
harfield
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
brings
up
for
review
a
decision
by
divided
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
solicitor
general
said
of
that
decision
that
it
seriously
impairs
the
power
of
the
executive
over
the
control
of
foreign
affairs.
the
case
may
be
stated
very
briefly.
the
material
facts
are
not
in
dispute.
in
september
1960,
the
petitioner
first
national
city
bank
owned
and
operated
11
branches
in
cuba.
on
the
night
of
friday,
september
16,
1960,
the
cuban
government
seized
those
branches.
the
instrumentalities
at
use
were
its
armed
militia
and
the
banco
nacional
de
cuba,
the
respondent
here.
on
the
following
day,
saturday,
there
was
a
radio
announcement
that
the
confiscation
of
american
banks
had
occurred
by
reason
of
executive
power
resolution
number
two,
issued
under
cuban
law
851.
on
the
opening
of
business
on
monday,
september
19,
the
respondent
in
this
case
was
in
full
possession
of
the
petitioner’s
foreign
branches
and
it
was
the
respondent
that
served
formal
notice
of
confiscation
on
a
resident
vice
president
of
the
petitioner
who
had
been
summoned
to
the
petitioner’s
former
main
branch
for
that
purpose.
on
the
following
day,
the
petitioner
cabled
to
the
respondent
referring
to
the
seizure
of
the
branches
and
stating
we
have
exercise
our
rights
of
lien
and
offset
and
closed
your
accounts
as
of
september
17.
now,
among
those
accounts
was
a
loan
account
which
had
originally
been
made
in
1958,
and
this
was
a
loan
made
by
this
petitioner
to
the
government
of
cuba
here
in
new
york
city.
the
borrower
was
a
cuban
government
instrumentality
called
bandes
(ph)
and
collateral
for
the
loan
was
pledge
by
another
cuban
government
instrumentality
called
fondo
(ph),
and
a
third
cuban
government
instrumentality,
the
respondent
in
this
case
acted
as
the
fiscal
agent
for
the
government
in
connection
with
this.
on
september
21
and
22,
we
are
still
operating
in
a
five-day
compass.
the
petitioner
sold
the
collateral
that
was
in
new
york
and
after
crediting
the
respondent
the
amount
of
principal
and
interest
on
the
loan,
there
remain
on
the
petitioner’s
books
in
new
york
a
balance
of
just
about
$2
million.
two
months
later
in
november
of
1960,
the
respondent
instituted
this
lawsuit
to
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
to
recover
that
balance.
and
as
a
defense
counterclaim
and
setoff,
the
petitioner
showed
that
the
value
of
the
confiscated
branches
exceeded
the
amount
claimed
by
the
respondent.
i
pause
here
to
say
that
there
is
no
dispute
as
to
this
value.
the
parties
have
stipulated
that
if
the
petitioner
is
lawfully
entitled
to
the
offset
claim
by
it,
the
amount
is
such
that
the
respondent
shall
take
nothing
in
this
action.
mr.
henry
harfield
i
take
it
that
the
$2
million
would
--
you
mean
in
the
sense,
physically
will
it
be
remitted
to
cuba?
mr.
henry
harfield
well,
i
take
it
that
the
any
recovery
by
banco
nacional
would
be
for
the
benefit
of
the
cuban
government
because
banco
nacional
is
at
least
at
this
point
completely
integrated
into
the
cuban
monolithic
system.
now,
there
is
a
blocking
system
that
is
--
mr.
henry
harfield
yes.
my
understanding
is
that
the
--
if
judgment
were
awarded
to
banco
nacional
to
cuba
that
the
amount
of
that
judgment
would
be
subjected
to
freezing
under
executive
order.
that
is
to
say
it
would
he
credited
to
a
blocked
account,
hopefully
with
the
same
bank.
until
the
government
reaches
a
policy
which
is
has
not
yet
done
as
to
what
if
anything
is
going
to
happen
to
the
blocked
cuban
property.
but
i
believe
it
is
correct
that
the
amount
of
that
judgment
less
an
allowance
of
attorney’s
fee
for
the
successful
plaintiff
which
i
am
given
to
understand
this
allowed
would
be
frozen,
abiding
the
event
ultimately
of
a
disposition
of
cuban
affairs.
mr.
henry
harfield
i
compare
$2
million
good
reasons
why
the
respondent
is
fighting
hard,
i
mean
why
the
petitioner
is
fighting
hard
for
it.
well,
let
me
just
continue
if
i
may
because
the
time
sequence
that
i
have
been
perhaps
boring
you
with
is,
i
believe
important
in
this
case.
the
case
was
submitted
on
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment
in
july
of
1961,
but
was
not
decided
until
late
june
of
1967.
meanwhile
and
this
was
not
indolence
on
the
part
of
the
district
judge.
meanwhile,
the
sabbatino
case
had
been
decided
by
this
court
thereafter
the
congress
had
an
enacted
the
hickenlooper
amendment
to
the
foreign
assistance
act,
the
sabbatino
litigation
had
gone
back
to
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
sub
nomine
banco
nacional
against
farr
and
was
there
decided.
and
so
consistently
with
its
decision
in
that
farr
case,
the
district
court
in
this
case
held
that
cuba’s
confiscation
of
american
property
violated
international
law
and
that
the
petitioner
was
entitled
to
its
offset.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
decision
in
the
farr
case
explicitly
holding
that
the
cuban
confiscation
where
a
violation
of
international
law.
but
reverse
the
decision
in
this
case
on
the
ground
that
the
act
of
state
doctrine
precluded
it
from
inquiring
into
the
validity
or
even
the
consequences
of
those
same
acts.
now
at
that
stage,
that
the
state
department
transmitted
to
this
court
its
views
that
important
considerations
of
foreign
policy
should
preclude
the
application
of
the
act
of
state
doctrine
to
cases
like
the
instrument.
this
court
granted
certiorari,
vacated
the
judgment,
remanded
the
case
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
reconsideration
in
the
light
of
the
views
of
the
department
of
state.
the
court
below,
nevertheless,
judge
hayes
dissenting
determine
to
adhere
with
original
decision,
this
court
granted
certiorari
on
october
12,
1971.
now,
i
begin
with
the
proposition
that
the
act
of
state
doctrine
was
not
conceived
as
a
device
to
create
an
unfair
advantage
to
foreign
governments
that
comes
in
to
our
courts
as
suitors.
in
this
case,
to
cut
off
the
petitioner’s
legitimate
defenses
would
be
manifestly
unfair.
moreover,
the
executive
branch
and
i
am
quoting
“has
made
clear
its
view
that
application
of
the
act
of
state
doctrine
would
be
inimical
to
significant
policy
interest
of
the
united
states.”
mr.
henry
harfield
it
originated
in
the
courts
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
henry
harfield
i
think
it
was
not
precisely
on
the
suggestion
from
the
executive
but
it
is
so
interrelated.
mr.
henry
harfield
it’s
a
doctrine
of
committee.
mr.
henry
harfield
it
is
a
doctrine
of
committee
as
between
branches
as
well
as
between
--
mr.
henry
harfield
nations,
as
between
governments.
mr.
henry
harfield
i
believe
that
to
be
exactly
correct.
and
the
--
i
shall
indeed
at
the
risk
of
repeating
what
you
said
varies
exactly
elaborate
that
fact
is
as
i
go
on
because
i
think
that
the
extraordinarily
position,
we
find
ourselves
in
this
case
is
that
a
doctrine
which
was
conceived.
chief
justice
says,
it
is
between
committee
between
branches
as
well
as
between
nations,
and
which
clearly
was
conceived
for
the
benefit
of
the
coordinate
branches
of
our
own
government
is
now
attempted
to
be
used
as
a
weapon
to
create
divisiveness
among
the
coordinate
branches.
this
is
perhaps
my
judgment,
the
single
most
important
issue
in
the
case
at
this
particular
stage
and
it
goes
beyond
simply
the
recognition
of
the
fact
that
the
doctrine
conceived
in
coordinate
committee
is
now
be
used
as
a
lethal
weapon.
it
offends
us
well.
its
application
in
this
case
would
offend
as
well,
the
position
of
the
legislative
branch.
because
clearly,
one
of
the
interest
of
the
united
states
to
which
the
government
--
our
government
has
referred
in
its
amicus
brief
here
is
respect
for
international
law.
and
our
government
has
repeatedly
emphasized
that
principle
of
international
law
which
says
that
the
right
of
a
sovereign
to
expropriate
property
is
coupled
with
the
obligation
to
pay
for
it,
to
make
prompt
adequate
and
effective
compensation.
in
this
case,
cuba
has
to
fall
on
that
obligation
and
it’s
indebted
to
this
petitioner
just
as
surely
as
if
it
had
to
fallen
on
a
promissory
note
or
a
bond.
and
national
city
bank
against
republic
of
china,
this
court
sustained
a
defense
counterclaim
and
setoff
based
on
a
defaulted
obligation
of
a
foreign
government
that
entered
our
court
as
a
suitor.
now,
the
respondent
has
argued
that
the
republic
of
china
is
not
an
act
of
state
case
because
the
words
act
of
state
where
not
used,
and
besides
and
i
am
quite
that
it
is
briefs
the
respondent
has
pointed
out
that
a
mere
default
by
foreign
sovereign
may
not
be
sufficient
to
be
regard
to
be
an
act
of
state.
but
if
the
republic
of
china
is
not
an
act
of
state
case,
then
this
is
not
an
act
of
state
case
because
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
the
repudiation
of
an
obligation
by
a
foreign
government
that
they
are
after
comes
in
here
and
attempts
to
seek
our
law,
mr.
justice
frank
burger
said
clear
of
any
defenses.
don’t
listen
to
those
fellows
that
say
they
have
a
defense.
the
act
of
state
doctrine
was
not
intended
for
that
purpose,
and
i
pointed
out
that
in
the
area
of
committee
between
nations,
the
act
of
state
doctrine
was
devised
to
avoid
a
friction
there
which
would
either
because
our
courts
have
no
power
or
because
they
chose
not
to
exercise
that
the
jurisdiction,
that
might
call
in
question
the
validity
and
the
effect
of
acts
fully
executed
by
foreign
government
within
its
own
territory.
but,
to
refuse
to
apply
the
act
of
state
doctrine
in
this
case
does
not
result
in
any
reversal
of
any
physical
act
that
took
place
in
cuba.
it
doesn’t
call
in
question
i
think
the
security
of
titles
and
international
trade
simply
because
about
an
offset.
and
the
refusal
to
apply
the
doctrine
would
be
consistent
with
the
policy
and
interest
of
the
united
states
as
declared
both
by
the
legislative
and
the
executive
branches.
the
importance
of
that
policy
i
suggest
is
underscored
by
the
so
called
hickenlooper
amendment.
these
adopt
as
the
law
of
the
united
states
the
international
law
principle
of
compensation
for
the
taking
of
property.
moreover,
they
specified
that
when
there
is
a
violation
of
international
law
including
but
not
limited
to
violation
of
the
principle
of
compensation,
then
the
act
of
state
doctrine
shall
not
be
applicable.
in
this
case,
the
respondent
asserts
this
act
of
state
doctrine
as
a
defense,
as
a
defense
against
the
petitioner’s
counterclaim.
now,
if
the
respondent
has
violated
the
principles
of
international
law,
it
is
not
entitled
to
assert
that
defense
in
this
court.
the
court
of
appeals,
court
below
of
the
second
circuit
reached
the
same
conclusion,
the
conclusion
that
cuban
law
851
was
a
violation
of
international
law
in
the
farr
case
and
the
briefs
that
conclusion
in
a
decision
which
this
court
left
under
stir.
in
this
case,
even
in
this
case,
the
court
below
of
the
majority
did
not
question
the
fact
that
under
cuban
law
851,
cuba
was
acting
in
violation
of
international
law.
so
in
view
of
the
fact
that
cuba’s
confiscations
had
been
held
by
our
courts
to
be
unlawful.
the
respondent
should
not
be
entitled
to
defend
on
that
ground,
the
act
of
state
doctrine.
mr.
henry
harfield
yes,
i
do
your
honor.
mr.
henry
harfield
well,
on
two
bases.
to
begin
with
that
on
a
record
before
and
then
i
would
contended
there
was
more
than
adequate
evidence,
the
banco
nacional
had
been
totally
absorb
into
the
cuban
government
so
that
it
was
indistinguishable.
if
it
ever
had
that
as
a
respondent
argues
and
autonomous
institution,
it
loss
that
autonomy
before
the
events
here
because
as
the
respondent
have
said,
as
cuba
was
in
the
process
of
changing
into
a
socialist
state,
it
took
all
the
necessarily
steps
to
destroy
autonomy.
but
most
importantly
in
this
case,
the
rule
of
banco
nacional
has
at
all
times
been
that
of
an
agent
for
the
cuban
government,
and
that
is
why
i
elaborate
it
as
much
as
i
did
at
the
outset
of
my
remarks
that
the
collateral,
the
proceeds
of
which
are
now
in
suit
was
pledge
by
fondo
which
was
part
of
the
cuban
government.
the
banco
nacional
in
handling
the
proceeds
of
that
loan
and
in
handling
the
collateral
was
acting
for
the
cuban
government,
and
you
have
a
perfect
opposition
because
there
is
no
doubt
that
if
there
is
a
recovery
for
the
respondent
here
that
the
sole
beneficiary
will
be
the
cuban
government.
unless
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
says
our
government
intervenes
at
some
point,
but
we
mustn’t
anticipate
that
i
claim
is
perfect
opposition
of
parties.
mr.
henry
harfield
well,
i
think
that
there
are
really
is
no
such
thing
as
a
usual
procedure.
in
this
case,
the
offset
taken
by
this
petitioner
occurred
three
years
and
this
suit
was
started
about
three
years
before
there
was
any
government
action
freezing
cuban
assets.
so
i
point
out
in
passing
that
if
this
petitioner
had
not
exercise
its
right
of
offset,
then
the
response
to
your
question
sir
would
have
been
that
the
money
had
probably
gone
down
the
cuba
and
then
used
to
pay
chinese
technicians,
because
the
barking
did
not
occur
until
about
three
years
afterward.
now
at
that
stage,
cuban
assets
in
this
country
where
frozen
but
they
where
not
vested
it,
they
where
not
seized,
and
thereafter
--
after
the
freezing,
a
system
of
claim
submission
was
setup
under
the
foreign
claim
settlement
commission.
this
was
about
four
years
after
these
transactions.
this
petitioner
filed
its
claim
with
the
foreign
claim
settlement
commission
asserting
the
taking
of
its
properties
in
cuba
and
of
assigning
a
value
to
it.
it
then
deducted
from
the
amount
it
was
filing
as
a
claim,
the
amount
of
its
offset
in
this
case
which
credited
cuba
with
this.
and
the
foreign
claim
settlement
commission
has
allowed
the
petitioner’s
claim
after
deducting
from
the
claim,
the
amount
of
this
offset
is
on
effect,
they
have
regarded
the
foreign
claim
settlement
commission
has
regarded
this
petitioner
as
already
having
recouped
to
the
extent
of
its
county
claim.
mr.
henry
harfield
that's
correct.
mr.
henry
harfield
in
addition
to
the
--
mr.
henry
harfield
and
i
mentioned
it
mr.
justice
white
that
at
the
time
that
the
freeze
was
being
put
on,
there
was
considerable
discussion
in
congress
as
to
whether
the
freeze
should
be
moved
to
that
second
step
and
for
vesting
and
the
decision
was
not
to
do
that,
at
least
to
that
time
because
to
take
that
property
that
a
private
cuban
as
well
as
cuban
government
people
would
have
been
regarded
by
certain
members
of
congress
as
the
same
kind
of
sin
which
castro
have
been
guilty.
so,
there
are
the
two
steps
that
you
imagine
and
our
government
has
not
yet
taken
that
second
step.
mr.
henry
harfield
yes.
mr.
henry
harfield
well,
i
think
that
may
be
a
position.
i
would
certainly
say
that
it
is
not
a
position
that
should
be.
it
should
be
regarded
very
well
because
as
mr.
justice
white
is
pointed
out,
our
government
has
not
yet
decided
that
it
is
going
to
treat
cuba
as
if
it
were
a
bankrupt
to
state.
but
even
if
it
did,
all
of
the
learning
under
the
bankruptcy
act
entitles
a
person
who
is
secured
by
reason
of
existing
relationships
of
having
collateral,
of
having
liens
is
in
that
person
is
entitled
to
a
preference
by
law
and
surely,
a
secured
creditor
always
has
a
preference
over
an
unsecured
creditor.
but
this
is
a
preference
which
has
been
certainly
condone
if
not
applauded,
and
this
if
you
equate
this
to
bankruptcy,
then
we
are
exactly
in
the
position
of
having
exercised
a
setoff
which
under
section
68
of
the
bankruptcy
law
is
solid.
mr.
henry
harfield
i
would
think
not.
i
think
that
my
understanding
of
the
law
with
respect
to
offsets
some
counterclaims
is
that
you
simply
net
the
accounts
between
the
parties
and
not
certainly
in
new
york
where
this
offset
was
exercised.
not
for
over
a
hundred
years
has
there
been
a
necessity
of
parceling
this
out
on
a
precise
basis.
what
you
do
is
to
--
you
do
not
have
to
counterclaim,
you
do
not
have
to
offset
in
respect
of
the
identical
transaction.
mr.
henry
harfield
that
is
correct.
mr.
henry
harfield
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
henry
harfield
yes,
or
to
reinstate
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
i
really
have
very
little
to
add
at
this
time.
i’d
like
to
reserve
it.
i
want
to
make
just
one
last
point
on
the
act
of
state
doctrine
which
is
the
point
that
we
came
here
on.
the
point
of
the
majority
below
dealt
with,
and
i
suggest
that
any
doubt
as
to
the
applicability
of
the
doctrine
to
this
case
at
this
time
has
been
removed
by
the
supervening
expression
of
the
executive.
and
that
is
an
expression
of
the
executive
as
to
the
foreign
policy
interest
of
the
united
states.
now,
the
position
of
the
united
states
in
this
case
is
crystal
clear.
i
think
there
is
no
dispute
at
all
as
to
what
that
position
is.
but
the
respondent
would
on
his
brief
appear
to
have
this
court
believe
that
the
executive
is
invading
the
province
of
the
judicial
branch
and
i
suggest
that
precisely
the
opposite
is
true.
as
judge
hayes
said
in
dissent
below,
the
majority
of
the
court
below
by
applying
the
act
of
state
doctrine
after
an
independent
evaluation
of
the
merits
of
the
state
department’s
decision
is
you
certain
the
same
executive
function
which
it
is
the
same
executive
prerogative
which
it
is
the
function
of
that
doctrine
to
preserve.
the
constitutional
mandate
to
the
judicial
branch
is
to
decide
cases
and
where
there
is
a
concern
that
the
judicial
branch
might
transgress
on
a
exclusive
province
of
the
executive
and
the
conduct
of
foreign
affairs,
there
is
an
abstention
on
the
part
of
the
judicial
branch
and
where
the
executive
is
silent,
then
an
encroachment
is
presumed
and
the
judiciary
is
it
tends
to
abstain.
but
here,
the
executive
has
formerly
declared
that
the
foreign
policy
interest
of
the
united
states
will
be
furthered
to
the
exercise
by
this
court
of
its
normal
function,
the
resolution
of
cases
before
it.
and
in
the
light
of
that
declaration,
i
would
suggest
that
abstention
is
not
neutrality.
it
is
as
the
solicitor
general
has
said
a
serious
impairment
of
the
power
of
the
executive
to
control
foreign
affairs.
now,
the
doctrine
of
separation
of
power
can
scarcely
be
regarded
as
a
requirement
of
internecine
confrontation
between
coordinate
branches
of
the
same
government
for
the
benefit
of
an
unfriendly
government.
at
this
point
in
this
case,
there
is
no
doubt
that
application
of
the
act
of
state
doctrine
will
further
the
foreign
policy
interest
of
cuba.
but
i
suggest
to
you
that
it
is
inescapably
true
that
it
frustrate
the
foreign
policy
interest
of
the
united
states,
and
i
urge
that
the
doctrine
was
not
applicable
to
this
case,
that
it
should
not
be
applied
to
this
case
and
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
should
be
reverse.
mr.
henry
harfield
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
begin
just
by
without
attempting
to
argue
these
points
to
indicate
that
at
page
15
of
our
reply
brief.
we
pointed
out
that
on
october
13,
1960,
and
that
date
is
important.
this
was
between
the
time
that
the
cuban
government
had
confiscated
the
bank’s
property
in
cuba
and
after
the
bank
had
asserted
its
right
of
offset
which
i
mentioned
to
you
within
a
matter
of
days
or
so
that
following
that
--
but
before
the
action
was
commenced,
the
cuban
government
dissolved
fondo
which
had
been
the
owner
of
this
collateral
if
pledge
and
as
we
point
out
as
i
say
at
page
15
of
the
reply
brief
transferred
the
rights
of
fondo
in
the
collateral
to
this
respondent.
then
when
that
had
been
done,
they
started
the
lawsuit.
i
don’t
want
to
dwell
too
much
on
the
question
of
the
autonomy
of
this
respondent.
i
think
and
i
made
this
point
back
in
the
district
court
there
is
some
11
years
ago,
there
is
pretty
good
president
on
this
which
goes
back
to
genesis
and
says
the
voice
is
jacob’s
voice
but
the
hands
of
the
hands
of
esau,
and
i
think
that
that
is
applicable
in
respect
to
the
relationship
and
the
transactional
relationship
between
the
government
of
cuba
and
this
respondent.
mr.
henry
harfield
thank
you,
your
honor.
as
to
the
question
of
the
argument
about
windfall,
i
would
refer
the
court
with
respect
to
page
10
of
our
reply
brief
where
we’ve
done
the
best
we
can
to
deal
with
that
argument
and
i
won’t
press
this
further
on
your
time.
i
want
to
close
simply
by
knowing
what
is
really
not
my
job
to
do
and
that
is
talk
about
the
fact
that
there
is
a
great
deal
of
more
that
is
happened
since
the
sabbatino
case
then
a
change
of
administration,
and
a
great
deal
more
in
respect
of
what
our
government
has
done.
this
court
will
surely
be
aware
that
in
the
sabbatino
case,
the
government
made
no
expression
whatsoever,
and
protested
against
a
misconstruction
of
what
had
been
alleged
to
be
its
statement.
here,
it
has
done
what
it
set
out
to
do
and
is
i
submit
entirely
consistent
in
its
position
as
to
its
function
and
its
duty
with
respect
to
the
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states
and
with
suggestions
to
a
coordinate
branch
when
it
becomes
appropriate
to
do
so,
and
i
think
that
the
department
is
been
perfectly
consistent.
now,
let
me
close
on
this
point.
the
argument
that
has
been
made
here
comes
on
two
points.
one
of
them
is
that
this
court
should
apply
the
act
of
state
doctrine
whether
or
not
it
was
otherwise
applicable
because
its
coordinate
branches
of
government
requested
not
to
do
so,
and
that
unless
the
court
does
this
extraordinary
thing,
it
is
going
to
find
itself
in
the
position
where
it
has
to
make
a
decision
as
to
international
law.
well,
this
is
the
function
of
the
court
as
was
recognized
by
like
mr.
justice
harlan
in
sabbatino.
it’s
one
of
the
many
functions,
and
the
suggestion
that
the
court
must
shy
away
from
a
decision
of
international
law
seems
to
me
perfectly
absurd.
turning
then
to
the
question
of
what
is
the
international
law
on
this
issue,
and
again,
i
don’t
want
to
burden
the
court,
but
we
have
a
history
that
goes
back
as
far
as
there’s
any
record
of
government
policy
and
of
acceptance
by
the
judicial
branch,
the
proposition
that
when
a
foreign
government
takes
somebody’s
property,
particularly
if
it
is
property
for
the
american,
there
is
an
implied
obligation
to
pay
for
it.
that
to
recognize
that
obligation
does
not
involved
characterizing
the
foreign
government
as
being
a
thief
or
a
villain.
this
does
not
really
call
in
question
of
validity,
but
to
the
extent
that
the
validity
can
be
called
in
question
as
i
suggest,
it
already
had
been
under
a
case
which
mr.
rabinowitz
agrees
that
he
can
look
for
amendment
applies
to
as
in
the
farr
case.
there
can
be
no
doubt.
mr.
henry
harfield
well,
i
think
that
would
be
so
your
honor.
here
as
i
have
said,
the
value
is
stipulated.
the
motives
may
be
taken
into
consideration
where
there
is
discrimination
as
i
believe
the
finding
has
been
so
far
of
the
courts
in
the
united
states.
thank
you.
mr.
henry
harfield
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
brings
up
for
review
a
decision
by
divided
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
solicitor
general
said
of
that
decision
that
it
seriously
impairs
the
power
of
the
executive
over
the
control
of
foreign
affairs.
the
case
may
be
stated
very
briefly.
the
material
facts
are
not
in
dispute.
in
september
1960,
the
petitioner
first
national
city
bank
owned
and
operated
11
branches
in
cuba.
on
the
night
of
friday,
september
16,
1960,
the
cuban
government
seized
those
branches.
the
instrumentalities
at
use
were
its
armed
militia
and
the
banco
nacional
de
cuba,
the
respondent
here.
on
the
following
day,
saturday,
there
was
a
radio
announcement
that
the
confiscation
of
american
banks
had
occurred
by
reason
of
executive
power
resolution
number
two,
issued
under
cuban
law
851.
on
the
opening
of
business
on
monday,
september
19,
the
respondent
in
this
case
was
in
full
possession
of
the
petitioner’s
foreign
branches
and
it
was
the
respondent
that
served
formal
notice
of
confiscation
on
a
resident
vice
president
of
the
petitioner
who
had
been
summoned
to
the
petitioner’s
former
main
branch
for
that
purpose.
on
the
following
day,
the
petitioner
cabled
to
the
respondent
referring
to
the
seizure
of
the
branches
and
stating
we
have
exercise
our
rights
of
lien
and
offset
and
closed
your
accounts
as
of
september
17.
now,
among
those
accounts
was
a
loan
account
which
had
originally
been
made
in
1958,
and
this
was
a
loan
made
by
this
petitioner
to
the
government
of
cuba
here
in
new
york
city.
the
borrower
was
a
cuban
government
instrumentality
called
bandes
(ph)
and
collateral
for
the
loan
was
pledge
by
another
cuban
government
instrumentality
called
fondo
(ph),
and
a
third
cuban
government
instrumentality,
the
respondent
in
this
case
acted
as
the
fiscal
agent
for
the
government
in
connection
with
this.
on
september
21
and
22,
we
are
still
operating
in
a
five-day
compass.
the
petitioner
sold
the
collateral
that
was
in
new
york
and
after
crediting
the
respondent
the
amount
of
principal
and
interest
on
the
loan,
there
remain
on
the
petitioner’s
books
in
new
york
a
balance
of
just
about
$2
million.
two
months
later
in
november
of
1960,
the
respondent
instituted
this
lawsuit
to
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
to
recover
that
balance.
and
as
a
defense
counterclaim
and
setoff,
the
petitioner
showed
that
the
value
of
the
confiscated
branches
exceeded
the
amount
claimed
by
the
respondent.
i
pause
here
to
say
that
there
is
no
dispute
as
to
this
value.
the
parties
have
stipulated
that
if
the
petitioner
is
lawfully
entitled
to
the
offset
claim
by
it,
the
amount
is
such
that
the
respondent
shall
take
nothing
in
this
action.
mr.
henry
harfield
i
take
it
that
the
$2
million
would
--
you
mean
in
the
sense,
physically
will
it
be
remitted
to
cuba?
mr.
henry
harfield
well,
i
take
it
that
the
any
recovery
by
banco
nacional
would
be
for
the
benefit
of
the
cuban
government
because
banco
nacional
is
at
least
at
this
point
completely
integrated
into
the
cuban
monolithic
system.
now,
there
is
a
blocking
system
that
is
--
mr.
henry
harfield
yes.
my
understanding
is
that
the
--
if
judgment
were
awarded
to
banco
nacional
to
cuba
that
the
amount
of
that
judgment
would
be
subjected
to
freezing
under
executive
order.
that
is
to
say
it
would
he
credited
to
a
blocked
account,
hopefully
with
the
same
bank.
until
the
government
reaches
a
policy
which
is
has
not
yet
done
as
to
what
if
anything
is
going
to
happen
to
the
blocked
cuban
property.
but
i
believe
it
is
correct
that
the
amount
of
that
judgment
less
an
allowance
of
attorney’s
fee
for
the
successful
plaintiff
which
i
am
given
to
understand
this
allowed
would
be
frozen,
abiding
the
event
ultimately
of
a
disposition
of
cuban
affairs.
mr.
henry
harfield
i
compare
$2
million
good
reasons
why
the
respondent
is
fighting
hard,
i
mean
why
the
petitioner
is
fighting
hard
for
it.
well,
let
me
just
continue
if
i
may
because
the
time
sequence
that
i
have
been
perhaps
boring
you
with
is,
i
believe
important
in
this
case.
the
case
was
submitted
on
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment
in
july
of
1961,
but
was
not
decided
until
late
june
of
1967.
meanwhile
and
this
was
not
indolence
on
the
part
of
the
district
judge.
meanwhile,
the
sabbatino
case
had
been
decided
by
this
court
thereafter
the
congress
had
an
enacted
the
hickenlooper
amendment
to
the
foreign
assistance
act,
the
sabbatino
litigation
had
gone
back
to
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
sub
nomine
banco
nacional
against
farr
and
was
there
decided.
and
so
consistently
with
its
decision
in
that
farr
case,
the
district
court
in
this
case
held
that
cuba’s
confiscation
of
american
property
violated
international
law
and
that
the
petitioner
was
entitled
to
its
offset.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
decision
in
the
farr
case
explicitly
holding
that
the
cuban
confiscation
where
a
violation
of
international
law.
but
reverse
the
decision
in
this
case
on
the
ground
that
the
act
of
state
doctrine
precluded
it
from
inquiring
into
the
validity
or
even
the
consequences
of
those
same
acts.
now
at
that
stage,
that
the
state
department
transmitted
to
this
court
its
views
that
important
considerations
of
foreign
policy
should
preclude
the
application
of
the
act
of
state
doctrine
to
cases
like
the
instrument.
this
court
granted
certiorari,
vacated
the
judgment,
remanded
the
case
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
reconsideration
in
the
light
of
the
views
of
the
department
of
state.
the
court
below,
nevertheless,
judge
hayes
dissenting
determine
to
adhere
with
original
decision,
this
court
granted
certiorari
on
october
12,
1971.
now,
i
begin
with
the
proposition
that
the
act
of
state
doctrine
was
not
conceived
as
a
device
to
create
an
unfair
advantage
to
foreign
governments
that
comes
in
to
our
courts
as
suitors.
in
this
case,
to
cut
off
the
petitioner’s
legitimate
defenses
would
be
manifestly
unfair.
moreover,
the
executive
branch
and
i
am
quoting
“has
made
clear
its
view
that
application
of
the
act
of
state
doctrine
would
be
inimical
to
significant
policy
interest
of
the
united
states.”
mr.
henry
harfield
it
originated
in
the
courts
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
henry
harfield
i
think
it
was
not
precisely
on
the
suggestion
from
the
executive
but
it
is
so
interrelated.
mr.
henry
harfield
it’s
a
doctrine
of
committee.
mr.
henry
harfield
it
is
a
doctrine
of
committee
as
between
branches
as
well
as
between
--
mr.
henry
harfield
nations,
as
between
governments.
mr.
henry
harfield
i
believe
that
to
be
exactly
correct.
and
the
--
i
shall
indeed
at
the
risk
of
repeating
what
you
said
varies
exactly
elaborate
that
fact
is
as
i
go
on
because
i
think
that
the
extraordinarily
position,
we
find
ourselves
in
this
case
is
that
a
doctrine
which
was
conceived.
chief
justice
says,
it
is
between
committee
between
branches
as
well
as
between
nations,
and
which
clearly
was
conceived
for
the
benefit
of
the
coordinate
branches
of
our
own
government
is
now
attempted
to
be
used
as
a
weapon
to
create
divisiveness
among
the
coordinate
branches.
this
is
perhaps
my
judgment,
the
single
most
important
issue
in
the
case
at
this
particular
stage
and
it
goes
beyond
simply
the
recognition
of
the
fact
that
the
doctrine
conceived
in
coordinate
committee
is
now
be
used
as
a
lethal
weapon.
it
offends
us
well.
its
application
in
this
case
would
offend
as
well,
the
position
of
the
legislative
branch.
because
clearly,
one
of
the
interest
of
the
united
states
to
which
the
government
--
our
government
has
referred
in
its
amicus
brief
here
is
respect
for
international
law.
and
our
government
has
repeatedly
emphasized
that
principle
of
international
law
which
says
that
the
right
of
a
sovereign
to
expropriate
property
is
coupled
with
the
obligation
to
pay
for
it,
to
make
prompt
adequate
and
effective
compensation.
in
this
case,
cuba
has
to
fall
on
that
obligation
and
it’s
indebted
to
this
petitioner
just
as
surely
as
if
it
had
to
fallen
on
a
promissory
note
or
a
bond.
and
national
city
bank
against
republic
of
china,
this
court
sustained
a
defense
counterclaim
and
setoff
based
on
a
defaulted
obligation
of
a
foreign
government
that
entered
our
court
as
a
suitor.
now,
the
respondent
has
argued
that
the
republic
of
china
is
not
an
act
of
state
case
because
the
words
act
of
state
where
not
used,
and
besides
and
i
am
quite
that
it
is
briefs
the
respondent
has
pointed
out
that
a
mere
default
by
foreign
sovereign
may
not
be
sufficient
to
be
regard
to
be
an
act
of
state.
but
if
the
republic
of
china
is
not
an
act
of
state
case,
then
this
is
not
an
act
of
state
case
because
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
the
repudiation
of
an
obligation
by
a
foreign
government
that
they
are
after
comes
in
here
and
attempts
to
seek
our
law,
mr.
justice
frank
burger
said
clear
of
any
defenses.
don’t
listen
to
those
fellows
that
say
they
have
a
defense.
the
act
of
state
doctrine
was
not
intended
for
that
purpose,
and
i
pointed
out
that
in
the
area
of
committee
between
nations,
the
act
of
state
doctrine
was
devised
to
avoid
a
friction
there
which
would
either
because
our
courts
have
no
power
or
because
they
chose
not
to
exercise
that
the
jurisdiction,
that
might
call
in
question
the
validity
and
the
effect
of
acts
fully
executed
by
foreign
government
within
its
own
territory.
but,
to
refuse
to
apply
the
act
of
state
doctrine
in
this
case
does
not
result
in
any
reversal
of
any
physical
act
that
took
place
in
cuba.
it
doesn’t
call
in
question
i
think
the
security
of
titles
and
international
trade
simply
because
about
an
offset.
and
the
refusal
to
apply
the
doctrine
would
be
consistent
with
the
policy
and
interest
of
the
united
states
as
declared
both
by
the
legislative
and
the
executive
branches.
the
importance
of
that
policy
i
suggest
is
underscored
by
the
so
called
hickenlooper
amendment.
these
adopt
as
the
law
of
the
united
states
the
international
law
principle
of
compensation
for
the
taking
of
property.
moreover,
they
specified
that
when
there
is
a
violation
of
international
law
including
but
not
limited
to
violation
of
the
principle
of
compensation,
then
the
act
of
state
doctrine
shall
not
be
applicable.
in
this
case,
the
respondent
asserts
this
act
of
state
doctrine
as
a
defense,
as
a
defense
against
the
petitioner’s
counterclaim.
now,
if
the
respondent
has
violated
the
principles
of
international
law,
it
is
not
entitled
to
assert
that
defense
in
this
court.
the
court
of
appeals,
court
below
of
the
second
circuit
reached
the
same
conclusion,
the
conclusion
that
cuban
law
851
was
a
violation
of
international
law
in
the
farr
case
and
the
briefs
that
conclusion
in
a
decision
which
this
court
left
under
stir.
in
this
case,
even
in
this
case,
the
court
below
of
the
majority
did
not
question
the
fact
that
under
cuban
law
851,
cuba
was
acting
in
violation
of
international
law.
so
in
view
of
the
fact
that
cuba’s
confiscations
had
been
held
by
our
courts
to
be
unlawful.
the
respondent
should
not
be
entitled
to
defend
on
that
ground,
the
act
of
state
doctrine.
mr.
henry
harfield
yes,
i
do
your
honor.
mr.
henry
harfield
well,
on
two
bases.
to
begin
with
that
on
a
record
before
and
then
i
would
contended
there
was
more
than
adequate
evidence,
the
banco
nacional
had
been
totally
absorb
into
the
cuban
government
so
that
it
was
indistinguishable.
if
it
ever
had
that
as
a
respondent
argues
and
autonomous
institution,
it
loss
that
autonomy
before
the
events
here
because
as
the
respondent
have
said,
as
cuba
was
in
the
process
of
changing
into
a
socialist
state,
it
took
all
the
necessarily
steps
to
destroy
autonomy.
but
most
importantly
in
this
case,
the
rule
of
banco
nacional
has
at
all
times
been
that
of
an
agent
for
the
cuban
government,
and
that
is
why
i
elaborate
it
as
much
as
i
did
at
the
outset
of
my
remarks
that
the
collateral,
the
proceeds
of
which
are
now
in
suit
was
pledge
by
fondo
which
was
part
of
the
cuban
government.
the
banco
nacional
in
handling
the
proceeds
of
that
loan
and
in
handling
the
collateral
was
acting
for
the
cuban
government,
and
you
have
a
perfect
opposition
because
there
is
no
doubt
that
if
there
is
a
recovery
for
the
respondent
here
that
the
sole
beneficiary
will
be
the
cuban
government.
unless
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
says
our
government
intervenes
at
some
point,
but
we
mustn’t
anticipate
that
i
claim
is
perfect
opposition
of
parties.
mr.
henry
harfield
well,
i
think
that
there
are
really
is
no
such
thing
as
a
usual
procedure.
in
this
case,
the
offset
taken
by
this
petitioner
occurred
three
years
and
this
suit
was
started
about
three
years
before
there
was
any
government
action
freezing
cuban
assets.
so
i
point
out
in
passing
that
if
this
petitioner
had
not
exercise
its
right
of
offset,
then
the
response
to
your
question
sir
would
have
been
that
the
money
had
probably
gone
down
the
cuba
and
then
used
to
pay
chinese
technicians,
because
the
barking
did
not
occur
until
about
three
years
afterward.
now
at
that
stage,
cuban
assets
in
this
country
where
frozen
but
they
where
not
vested
it,
they
where
not
seized,
and
thereafter
--
after
the
freezing,
a
system
of
claim
submission
was
setup
under
the
foreign
claim
settlement
commission.
this
was
about
four
years
after
these
transactions.
this
petitioner
filed
its
claim
with
the
foreign
claim
settlement
commission
asserting
the
taking
of
its
properties
in
cuba
and
of
assigning
a
value
to
it.
it
then
deducted
from
the
amount
it
was
filing
as
a
claim,
the
amount
of
its
offset
in
this
case
which
credited
cuba
with
this.
and
the
foreign
claim
settlement
commission
has
allowed
the
petitioner’s
claim
after
deducting
from
the
claim,
the
amount
of
this
offset
is
on
effect,
they
have
regarded
the
foreign
claim
settlement
commission
has
regarded
this
petitioner
as
already
having
recouped
to
the
extent
of
its
county
claim.
mr.
henry
harfield
that's
correct.
mr.
henry
harfield
in
addition
to
the
--
mr.
henry
harfield
and
i
mentioned
it
mr.
justice
white
that
at
the
time
that
the
freeze
was
being
put
on,
there
was
considerable
discussion
in
congress
as
to
whether
the
freeze
should
be
moved
to
that
second
step
and
for
vesting
and
the
decision
was
not
to
do
that,
at
least
to
that
time
because
to
take
that
property
that
a
private
cuban
as
well
as
cuban
government
people
would
have
been
regarded
by
certain
members
of
congress
as
the
same
kind
of
sin
which
castro
have
been
guilty.
so,
there
are
the
two
steps
that
you
imagine
and
our
government
has
not
yet
taken
that
second
step.
mr.
henry
harfield
yes.
mr.
henry
harfield
well,
i
think
that
may
be
a
position.
i
would
certainly
say
that
it
is
not
a
position
that
should
be.
it
should
be
regarded
very
well
because
as
mr.
justice
white
is
pointed
out,
our
government
has
not
yet
decided
that
it
is
going
to
treat
cuba
as
if
it
were
a
bankrupt
to
state.
but
even
if
it
did,
all
of
the
learning
under
the
bankruptcy
act
entitles
a
person
who
is
secured
by
reason
of
existing
relationships
of
having
collateral,
of
having
liens
is
in
that
person
is
entitled
to
a
preference
by
law
and
surely,
a
secured
creditor
always
has
a
preference
over
an
unsecured
creditor.
but
this
is
a
preference
which
has
been
certainly
condone
if
not
applauded,
and
this
if
you
equate
this
to
bankruptcy,
then
we
are
exactly
in
the
position
of
having
exercised
a
setoff
which
under
section
68
of
the
bankruptcy
law
is
solid.
mr.
henry
harfield
i
would
think
not.
i
think
that
my
understanding
of
the
law
with
respect
to
offsets
some
counterclaims
is
that
you
simply
net
the
accounts
between
the
parties
and
not
certainly
in
new
york
where
this
offset
was
exercised.
not
for
over
a
hundred
years
has
there
been
a
necessity
of
parceling
this
out
on
a
precise
basis.
what
you
do
is
to
--
you
do
not
have
to
counterclaim,
you
do
not
have
to
offset
in
respect
of
the
identical
transaction.
mr.
henry
harfield
that
is
correct.
mr.
henry
harfield
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
henry
harfield
yes,
or
to
reinstate
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
i
really
have
very
little
to
add
at
this
time.
i’d
like
to
reserve
it.
i
want
to
make
just
one
last
point
on
the
act
of
state
doctrine
which
is
the
point
that
we
came
here
on.
the
point
of
the
majority
below
dealt
with,
and
i
suggest
that
any
doubt
as
to
the
applicability
of
the
doctrine
to
this
case
at
this
time
has
been
removed
by
the
supervening
expression
of
the
executive.
and
that
is
an
expression
of
the
executive
as
to
the
foreign
policy
interest
of
the
united
states.
now,
the
position
of
the
united
states
in
this
case
is
crystal
clear.
i
think
there
is
no
dispute
at
all
as
to
what
that
position
is.
but
the
respondent
would
on
his
brief
appear
to
have
this
court
believe
that
the
executive
is
invading
the
province
of
the
judicial
branch
and
i
suggest
that
precisely
the
opposite
is
true.
as
judge
hayes
said
in
dissent
below,
the
majority
of
the
court
below
by
applying
the
act
of
state
doctrine
after
an
independent
evaluation
of
the
merits
of
the
state
department’s
decision
is
you
certain
the
same
executive
function
which
it
is
the
same
executive
prerogative
which
it
is
the
function
of
that
doctrine
to
preserve.
the
constitutional
mandate
to
the
judicial
branch
is
to
decide
cases
and
where
there
is
a
concern
that
the
judicial
branch
might
transgress
on
a
exclusive
province
of
the
executive
and
the
conduct
of
foreign
affairs,
there
is
an
abstention
on
the
part
of
the
judicial
branch
and
where
the
executive
is
silent,
then
an
encroachment
is
presumed
and
the
judiciary
is
it
tends
to
abstain.
but
here,
the
executive
has
formerly
declared
that
the
foreign
policy
interest
of
the
united
states
will
be
furthered
to
the
exercise
by
this
court
of
its
normal
function,
the
resolution
of
cases
before
it.
and
in
the
light
of
that
declaration,
i
would
suggest
that
abstention
is
not
neutrality.
it
is
as
the
solicitor
general
has
said
a
serious
impairment
of
the
power
of
the
executive
to
control
foreign
affairs.
now,
the
doctrine
of
separation
of
power
can
scarcely
be
regarded
as
a
requirement
of
internecine
confrontation
between
coordinate
branches
of
the
same
government
for
the
benefit
of
an
unfriendly
government.
at
this
point
in
this
case,
there
is
no
doubt
that
application
of
the
act
of
state
doctrine
will
further
the
foreign
policy
interest
of
cuba.
but
i
suggest
to
you
that
it
is
inescapably
true
that
it
frustrate
the
foreign
policy
interest
of
the
united
states,
and
i
urge
that
the
doctrine
was
not
applicable
to
this
case,
that
it
should
not
be
applied
to
this
case
and
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
should
be
reverse.
mr.
henry
harfield
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
begin
just
by
without
attempting
to
argue
these
points
to
indicate
that
at
page
15
of
our
reply
brief.
we
pointed
out
that
on
october
13,
1960,
and
that
date
is
important.
this
was
between
the
time
that
the
cuban
government
had
confiscated
the
bank’s
property
in
cuba
and
after
the
bank
had
asserted
its
right
of
offset
which
i
mentioned
to
you
within
a
matter
of
days
or
so
that
following
that
--
but
before
the
action
was
commenced,
the
cuban
government
dissolved
fondo
which
had
been
the
owner
of
this
collateral
if
pledge
and
as
we
point
out
as
i
say
at
page
15
of
the
reply
brief
transferred
the
rights
of
fondo
in
the
collateral
to
this
respondent.
then
when
that
had
been
done,
they
started
the
lawsuit.
i
don’t
want
to
dwell
too
much
on
the
question
of
the
autonomy
of
this
respondent.
i
think
and
i
made
this
point
back
in
the
district
court
there
is
some
11
years
ago,
there
is
pretty
good
president
on
this
which
goes
back
to
genesis
and
says
the
voice
is
jacob’s
voice
but
the
hands
of
the
hands
of
esau,
and
i
think
that
that
is
applicable
in
respect
to
the
relationship
and
the
transactional
relationship
between
the
government
of
cuba
and
this
respondent.
mr.
henry
harfield
thank
you,
your
honor.
as
to
the
question
of
the
argument
about
windfall,
i
would
refer
the
court
with
respect
to
page
10
of
our
reply
brief
where
we’ve
done
the
best
we
can
to
deal
with
that
argument
and
i
won’t
press
this
further
on
your
time.
i
want
to
close
simply
by
knowing
what
is
really
not
my
job
to
do
and
that
is
talk
about
the
fact
that
there
is
a
great
deal
of
more
that
is
happened
since
the
sabbatino
case
then
a
change
of
administration,
and
a
great
deal
more
in
respect
of
what
our
government
has
done.
this
court
will
surely
be
aware
that
in
the
sabbatino
case,
the
government
made
no
expression
whatsoever,
and
protested
against
a
misconstruction
of
what
had
been
alleged
to
be
its
statement.
here,
it
has
done
what
it
set
out
to
do
and
is
i
submit
entirely
consistent
in
its
position
as
to
its
function
and
its
duty
with
respect
to
the
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states
and
with
suggestions
to
a
coordinate
branch
when
it
becomes
appropriate
to
do
so,
and
i
think
that
the
department
is
been
perfectly
consistent.
now,
let
me
close
on
this
point.
the
argument
that
has
been
made
here
comes
on
two
points.
one
of
them
is
that
this
court
should
apply
the
act
of
state
doctrine
whether
or
not
it
was
otherwise
applicable
because
its
coordinate
branches
of
government
requested
not
to
do
so,
and
that
unless
the
court
does
this
extraordinary
thing,
it
is
going
to
find
itself
in
the
position
where
it
has
to
make
a
decision
as
to
international
law.
well,
this
is
the
function
of
the
court
as
was
recognized
by
like
mr.
justice
harlan
in
sabbatino.
it’s
one
of
the
many
functions,
and
the
suggestion
that
the
court
must
shy
away
from
a
decision
of
international
law
seems
to
me
perfectly
absurd.
turning
then
to
the
question
of
what
is
the
international
law
on
this
issue,
and
again,
i
don’t
want
to
burden
the
court,
but
we
have
a
history
that
goes
back
as
far
as
there’s
any
record
of
government
policy
and
of
acceptance
by
the
judicial
branch,
the
proposition
that
when
a
foreign
government
takes
somebody’s
property,
particularly
if
it
is
property
for
the
american,
there
is
an
implied
obligation
to
pay
for
it.
that
to
recognize
that
obligation
does
not
involved
characterizing
the
foreign
government
as
being
a
thief
or
a
villain.
this
does
not
really
call
in
question
of
validity,
but
to
the
extent
that
the
validity
can
be
called
in
question
as
i
suggest,
it
already
had
been
under
a
case
which
mr.
rabinowitz
agrees
that
he
can
look
for
amendment
applies
to
as
in
the
farr
case.
there
can
be
no
doubt.
mr.
henry
harfield
well,
i
think
that
would
be
so
your
honor.
here
as
i
have
said,
the
value
is
stipulated.
the
motives
may
be
taken
into
consideration
where
there
is
discrimination
as
i
believe
the
finding
has
been
so
far
of
the
courts
in
the
united
states.
thank
you.
