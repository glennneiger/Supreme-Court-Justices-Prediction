mr.
victor
rabinowitz.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
pleased
the
court.
i
would
like
preliminarily
to
address
myself
to
two
questions
that
were
placed
by
one
by
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
the
other
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
and
while
they
are
preliminary
and
accent
peripheral
issues,
at
least
one
of
them
may
be
just
positive
of
the
case.
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
don’t
know
why
the
respondent
is
fighting
so
hard
in
this
case.
all
i
know
is
that
i
have
instructions
to
fight
hard
in
this
and
all
of
the
other
cases
which
will
involve
an
increase
in
the
amount
of
the
frozen
funds.
now,
those
funds
where
frozen
by
the
executive
branch
of
the
government,
and
unless
they
are
unfrozen
by
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
or
perhaps
by
congress,
they
are
going
to
remain
frozen
and
will
not
go
to
cuba
and
there
is
no
possibility
at
all
of
them
getting
to
cuba
short
of
an
action
by
the
executive
branch
or
the
legislative
branch,
and
perhaps
that
mean
shorter
from
settlement
of
the
general
dispute
between
the
united
states
and
cuba
which
may
it
may
come
at
sometime
in
the
future
i
assume.
we
all
hope
that
someday,
it
will
come.
but
until
that
day
comes,
i
think
it
maybe
reasonably
certain
that
those
funds
will
remain
frozen.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz.
of
course.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz.
we
want
to
--
i
could
speculate.
i
am
not
authorized
to
speculate
and
given
the
general
public
interest
in
the
fact
that
we
are
dealing
with
it’s
a
government
relations.
i
prefer
not
too.
i
don’t
know
where
i
could
only
guess
as
to
why
the
cuban
government
is
interested
in
carrying
on
this
and
as
i
say
a
great
deal
of
all
the
litigations.
i
think
that
something
maybe
said
in
response
to
justice
blackmun’s
request
for
commission
a
little
while
ago,
mainly
about
what
happens
to
these
frozen
funds
and
what
i
can
tell
you
is
not
what
will
happen
in
the
future,
but
what
has
happened
in
the
past
that
happened
with
respect
to
the
soviet
union,
that
happened
with
respect
to
yugoslavia,
with
respect
to
romania,
with
respect
to
happened
dozen
other
similar
situations
that
frozen
funds
will
collected.
they
remained
and
blocked
accounts
until
one
day
there
was
a
settlement.
and
those
funds
would
then
used
to
pay
for
all
creditors.
in
part
of
course
and
that
is
discussed
and
it
is
the
reason
for
part
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
below
and
i
think
the
first
court
of
appeals
opinion,
and
it
is
the
reason
and
i
think
a
perfectly
valid
reason
for
commenting
that
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
is
seeking
a
windfall,
i
would
prefer
to
call
it
a
preference.
a
preference
over
all
other
persons
who
may
have
claims
and
whose
only
logical
founders,
the
only
way
in
which
they
might
possibly
someday
get
some
return
is
through
a
large
frozen
fund.
now,
whether
my
client
has
that
in
mind,
i
do
not
know
because
i
have
not
been
told
and
as
i
say,
i
prefer
not
to
guess
about
these
things.
but
at
least,
in
factual
terms
and
looking
at
it
historically,
that
is
what
happened
in
the
case
of
the
other
matters
that
i
have
referred
to.
the
eastern
european
countries
generally
and
i
suppose
that
is
the
theory
upon
which
the
funds
will
frozen
in
this
case.
mr.
justice
white
is
likely
responsive
not
vested
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
was
a
law
passed
and
i
think
1963,
vesting
the
funds
and
it
was
until
the
year
later
so
that
the
present
of
funds
are
not
vested,
they
just
held
in
an
account
and
you
cannot
get
money
out
of
the
account
without
a
license
from
the
treasury
department,
and
i
assure
you
those
licenses
are
not
freely
granted.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz.
yes,
sir.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz.
well,
oh
while,
i
will
get
to
that
your
honor.
i
certainly
will
get
to
the
state
department’s
position
here
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states
of
cuba.
it
has
to
do
with
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states
in
which
i
feel
quite
free
to
speculate
because
no
one
would
suggest
that
i
am
expressing
the
views
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
government.
so,
i
will
get
to
that
in
just
a
moment.
i
would
also
like
preliminary
to
say
in
response
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist’s
question
about
this
counterclaim
matter.
we
do
contend
as
was
suggested
that
banco
nacional
is
an
autonomous
government
agency
much
as
i
think
we
have
about
50
autonomous
government
agencies
here
in
the
united
states.
no
one,
i
think
would
content
that
if
the
export
import
bank
where
to
claim
against
anyone
that
he
would
have
the
right
to
counterclaim
against
the
government
of
the
united
states.
even
though
the
funds
of
the
export
import
bank
all
come
ultimately
from
the
treasury
of
the
united
states,
even
though
the
export
import
bank
has
a
board
of
directors
which
is
controlled
exclusively
by
the
united
states,
event
though
the
united
states
created
it
by
statute
and
it
is
the
sole
stockholder,
nevertheless,
it
is
an
autonomous
government
agency
just
as
banco
nacional
is
an
autonomous
government
agency
and
i
think
that
the
record
is
clear
on
that,
and
while
i
think
it
is
a
point
which
would
be
dispositive
of
this
case,
[laughing
attempt]
i
don’t
think
it’s
what
we’re
here
for
to
discuss.
i
would
urge
the
court
as
i
have
in
point
five
of
my
brief
to
decide
the
case
on
that
point.
it
would
be
a
disposition
of
the
manner
in
favor
of
my
clients
it
would
avoid
all
of
these
other
difficult
international
law
problems
and
of
course,
my
client
and
i
would
like
it
and
i
hope
the
court
is
so
disposed.
but
if
it
is
not,
then
obviously,
there
are
other
points
which
are
of
much
greater
consequence.
in
the
petitioner’s
reply
brief
at
page
two,
he
suggests
that
there
are
in
general
too
big
issues
in
this
case.
and
if
i
may
reverse
the
order
of
those
issues
and
trace
them
a
little
less
contentiously,
i
would
agree
and
i
would
formulate
the
issues
as
follows.
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
does
the
act
of
state
doctrine
preclude
the
court
from
considering
the
petitioner’s
claim
that
the
respondent
acted
in
violation
of
international
law?
that’s
the
sabbatino
point
really,
and
it’s
discussed
in
points
one
to
four
of
the
respondent’s
brief.
and
point
two,
if
this
is
answered
in
the
negative,
was
the
nationalization
of
petitioner’s
property
by
the
republic
of
cuba
a
violation
of
international
law?
and
this
is
treated
in
points
i
think
six
or
seven
of
my
brief
in
the
appendix.
now,
the
act
of
state
doctrine
has
been
a
part
of
all
law
at
least
since
1897,
underhill
against
hernandez
and
the
supreme
court,
this
court
in
sabbatino
traced
the
doctrine
back
to
english
presidents
running
back
300
years.
the
most
recent
exposition
of
course
was
the
sabbatino
decision
in
1964
in
which
this
court
in
an
eight
to
one
opinion
upheld
the
doctrine
and
discussed
i
think
most
of
the
reasons
for
the
doctrine
in
great
detail.
and
i
will
not
repeat
the
reasons
for
that
decision,
the
reasons
for
the
act
of
state
doctrine
because
it
would
involve
largely
extensive
quotations
from
this
court’s
opinion
in
sabbatino
and
i
know
that
the
members
of
the
bench
are
familiar
with
it
and
there
is
no
point
in
my
doing
it.
except
to
say
that
i
submit
that
it
is
a
sound
doctrine
which
is
designed
to
keep
this
court
out
of
the
consideration
of
the
second
question,
namely
was
there
a
violation
of
international
law
here?
not
because
the
second
question
is
hard
to
decide,
this
court
gets
lots
of
cases
that
are
hard
to
decide
and
not
because
it’s
important.
because
this
case
--
this
court
gets
lots
of
cases
that
are
important.
but
because
it
necessarily
involves
political
consideration,
political
questions
which
are
best
left
to
the
executive
branch
of
the
government,
and
i
think
some
of
the
implications
of
this
will
appear
in
the
rest
of
my
argument.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz.
it
has
in
this
case.
in
the
sabbatino
case,
it
said
exactly
the
government,
the
opposite.
what
the
next
administration
will
say,
i
do
not
know.
if
there
is
one
thing
which
is
certain
about
our
form
of
government
and
which
is
not
perhaps
true
in
many
places
in
the
world
today,
it’s
that
administration’s
change,
and
that
policy
is
change,
and
just
as
mr.
deputy
attorney
general
katzenbach’s
stood
at
this
podium
seven
years
ago
and
said,
do
not
extend
the
bernstein
doctrine.
we
do
not
want
the
bernstein
doctrine
extended
is
an
embarrassment
to
our
government
to
extend
the
bernstein
doctrine.
so
we
find
the
solicitor
general
of
today
expressing
a
contrary
opinion
and
what
tomorrow’s
solicitor
general
for
legal
advice
and
to
the
state
department
will
say
i
do
not
know.
now,
if
it
is
perfectly
reasonable
and
proper
for
administrations
to
differ
in
policy.
we
expect
that,
that
is
why
we
have
elections
and
that
is
why
one
person
rather
than
another
is
elected
president
and
appoints
his
legal
adviser
and
his
solicitor
general.
it
is
quite
another
think
to
expect
this
court
to
follow
in
the
steps
of
the
administration
in
that
sense.
this
court
is
not
equipped
to,
is
not
expected
to,
and
was
not
intended
by
the
constitution
to
be
an
instrument
of
the
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states
anymore
than
it
is
an
instrument
of
the
domestic
policy
of
the
united
states.
this
court
is
to
decide
things
on
the
basis
of
law,
and
the
law
--
unless
this
court
is
prepared
to
reverse
sabbatino,
the
law
is
the
sabbatino
case,
and
on
the
basis
of
the
sabbatino
case,
this
court
has
set
and
i
can
think
of
no
better
way
of
saying
it
than
the
way
mr.
justice
harlan
did.
he
said
the
act
of
state
doctrine
has
constitutional
underpinnings.
it
arises
out
of
the
basic
relationships
between
branches
of
government
in
a
system
of
separation
of
powers.
it
could
turn
the
competency
of
these
similar
institutions
to
make
and
implement
particular
kinds
of
decisions
in
the
area
of
international
relations.
the
doctrine
is
formulated
and
passed
decisions
expresses
the
strong
sense
of
the
judicial
branch
that
its
engagement
in
the
test
of
passing
on
the
validity
of
foreign
acts
of
state
may
hinder
rather
than
further
this
country’s
pursuit
of
goal
both
for
itself
and
for
the
community
of
nations
as
a
whole
in
the
international
sphere.
now,
i
know
that
the
legal
advice
to
the
state
department
now
disagrees
with
that
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
next
sentence
in
mr.
justice
harlan
opinion
is,
many
commentators
disagree
with
this
view.
i
know
that
they
disagree
with
this
view.
one
of
the
persons
who
disagrees
with
this
view
is
mr.
justice
white,
but
the
fact
is
that
the
sabbatino
decision
discussed
all
of
these
and
discuss
it
in
considerable
detail
and
came
to
a
conclusion
which
i
submit
is
as
sound
today
as
it
was
in
1964.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz.
thank
you.
[laughing
attempt]
i
knew
you
would
not,
your
honor.
[laughter]
it
is
not
within
the
competency
of
this
court
with
all
due
respect
to
it,
to
get
involve
in
complicated
and
difficult
question
involving
the
application
of
the
international
policy
of
the
united
states.
now,
let
me
give
you
an
example
which
is
not
hypothetical
at
all.
the
cuban
expropriations
here
took
place
in
i
think
1960,
almost
immediately,
the
state
department
issued
a
statement
saying
these
confiscations
are
violations
of
international
law.
state
departments
always
do
that
in
this
kind
of
situation
and
i
assume,
it
is
done
in
pursuit
of
the
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states.
these
confiscations
are
illegal.
now,
we
are
here
10
years,
11
years
later,
we
could
have
been
on
the
other
circumstance
than
here
greatly
or
sooner.
and
one
of
the
issues
that
is
presented
to
this
court
is
where
those
confiscations
violations
of
international
law?
suppose
this
court
after
consideration
of
the
law
should
be
impelled
as
i
would
urge
it
to
hold
that
it
was
not
a
violation
of
international
law
at
all.
this
court
would
then
be
placed
in
a
position
of
having
to
disagree
with
the
state
department
on
a
question
on
which
the
state
department
has
expressed
itself
not
once,
but
many
times.
i
submit
that
this
court
should
not
be
placed
in
that
position.
this
court
should
not
be
placed
in
the
position
where
it
may
be
called
upon
to
express
opinions
on
questions
of
international
law
which
are
contrary
to
the
opinions
expressed
by
the
executive
branch
in
pursuit
of
its
foreign
policy.
not
this
court’s
foreign
policy,
but
the
executive
branches
foreign
policy
because
that’s
its
responsibility.
and
this
court
ought
not
to
be
placed
in
a
position
where
it
has
that
responsibility
which
as
i
say
with
all
respect
to
this
court,
it
is
not
equipped
the
count.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz.
yes,
sir.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz.
oh!
no,
sir.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz.
i
am
limiting
to
the
questions
of
the
validity
of
the
acts
of
the
foreign
sovereign
gone
within
its
territory.
and
this
i
say,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
the
position
that
the
petitioner
here
is
advocating
rights
as
this
very
serious
danger
in
connection
with
the
separation
of
power.
now
this
case
is
exactly,
i
might
just
to
dispose
for
a
moment
of
this
hickenlooper
amendment
point,
i
don’t
know
what
is
really
argued
seriously.
the
hickenlooper
amendment
is
drawn
in
very,
very
narrow
language.
the
language
is
very
hard
to
understand,
and
i
am
not
going
to
try
to
read
it
here.
it
can
require
very
careful
study
and
i
have
tried
to
analyze
it
my
brief
so
that
to
be
of
assistance
to
the
court
but
it
can’t
very
well
be
done
on
our
oral
argument.
the
court
of
appeals
held
and
here
the
court
was
unanimous
that
the
hickenlooper
amendment
did
not
apply
to
this
kind
of
situation
at
all,
would
never
intended
to
apply
in
this
situation
that
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york
has
also
held
with
the
hickenlooper
amendment
is
to
be
given
a
very
narrow
reading
and
did
not
apply
to
a
situation
before
it
in
the
french
case
so
that
the
hickenlooper
amendment
--
i
really
don’t
think
has
anything
do
to
with
this
case
and
i
think
this
court
when
it
gets
to
analyze
it
in
detail
will
come
to
the
same
conclusion.
what
is
much
more
important
is
not
the
hickenlooper
amendment
but
the
letter
of
mr.
stevenson.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz.
i
have
argued
it
so,
yes.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz.
yes.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz.
frankly,
your
honor.
you
have
expressed
it
even
better
than
i
did.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz.
i
agree.
i
think
the
hickenlooper
amendment
is
unconstitutional
because
it
is
an
economic
part
of
congress
to
tell
this
court
what
it
may
or
may
not.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz.
no,
sir.
if
it
doesn’t
apply,
i
don’t
think
it
is
relevant.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz.
well,
it
is
direction
to
this
court
which
it
constitutional
i
suppose
this
court
has
to
follow
that
in
certain
kind
cases.
not
this
kind
but
other
kinds
of
cases,
the
act
of
state
doctrine
shall
be
suspended.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz.
might.
i
suppose
that.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz.
now,
we
have
here
an
expression
by
a
legal
adviser
to
the
state
department
which
seeks
to
undercut
the
act
of
state
doctrine.
and
while
the
legal
advice
limit
to
his
contentional
or
has
lead
it
to
counterclaims,
i
really
don’t
understand
why
because
all
of
his
arguments
go
to
anytime
on
the
claim.
and
once
we
eliminate
the
counterclaim
element,
there
is
nothing
new
about
this
proposal.
the
proposal
in
effect
is
a
suggestion
that
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
shall
have
the
right
to
tell
the
court
either
to
apply
or
not
to
apply
the
act
of
state
doctrine.
now,
that
is
not
a
new
proposal.
it
was
made
first
when
mr.
stevenson
was
the
chairman
of
the
international
law
committee
of
the
bar
association
of
the
city
of
new
york
in
1959.
it
was
repeated
by
mr.
stevenson
when
he
was
writing
for
the
probably
american
chamber
of
international
law
in
about
1953.
it
was
discussed
by
the
court
in
the
sabbatino
case.
it
is
as
i
read
it
a
position
that
is
endorsed
by
mr.
justice
white
or
was
in
his
opinion,
in
his
dissenting
opinion
and
it
was
opposed
--
it
was
opposed
most
vigorously
by
mr.
katzenbach
and
by
the
solicitor
general
in
the
last
administration,
and
the
court
in
the
sabbatino
case
disapproved
it,
and
it
disapproved
it
for
reasons
that
are
set
forth
in
the
sabbatino
decision
and
nothing
new
has
happened.
except
that
whereas
the
last
administration
has
said
this
is
not
a
business
for
the
executive
branch
for
the
court
at
all
and
we
will
take
care
of
our
own
foreign
policy.
we
don’t
need
the
court
to
get
mixed
up
in
it
because
who
knows
how
the
court’s
going
to
decide.
it
is
really
uncontrollable.
we
don’t
know
how
the
court
is
going
to
decide
any
particular
question
and
therefore,
we
would
assume
that
the
court
stay
out
and
it
referred
over
and
over
again
to
the
possibility
of
embarrassment
to
the
executive
branch
because
we
do
not
know
how
the
court
will
decide
the
case.
now,
this
administration
differs
and
while
as
i
say,
mr.
stevenson,
of
course,
is
quite
consistent
he
took
this
position
while
in
private
factors,
he
took
this
position
as
editor
of
the
journal
and
he
takes
his
position
now
and
it
is
quite
proper
that
he
should
be
consistent
and
it
is
quite
proper
that
the
administration
should
change
when
the
administration
changes,
but
that
is
not
the
problem
of
this
court.
the
problem
of
this
court
is
to
apply
a
doctrine
which
is
80
years
old
at
least
in
our
court
and
which
was
most
recently
affirmed
in
sabbatino
and
no
new
reasons
have
been
suggested
why
that
doctrine
should
not
be
applied
at
this
point.
now,
once
we
get
passed
if
this
court
should
decide
that
the
act
of
state
doctrine
is
not
to
be
applied
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz.
i
think
not.
i
think
that
bernstein
was
a
freak.
i
think
the
case
was
a
sport.
it
arose
in
the
situation
which
is
very
difficult
to
duplicate.
the
facts
were
most
unusual
and
it’s
one
of
those
cases
which
because
it
involved
the
hitler
government
because
it
involved
the
terrible
excesses
against
persons
of
jewish
faith
at
the
seizure
of
property
under
circumstances
which
we
are
all
familiar
with,
and
because
the
government
was
no
longer
an
existence
presented
a
situation
which
is
i
say
is
sui
generis.
it’s
his
own
situation
and
this
is
exactly
i
mean,
this
is
not
my
idea,
this
is
exactly,
it
is
not
only
my
idea,
this
is
exactly
what
the
solicitor
general
said
in
the
brief
he
submitted
in
sabbatino.
he
said
it
is
exceedingly
narrow
situation
and
i
commend
the
reading
of
that
brief
too
your
honor.
it
is
exceedingly
narrow
case.
it
ought
not
be
extended
at
all.
it
arose
at
the
very
unusual
facts
which
are
not
duplicated
here
and
this
court,
the
supreme
court
has
been
the
past
on
it
in
effect
let’s
--
let
it
rest.
let’s
not
resurrect
it.
and
as
i
read
the
sabbatino
opinion,
that’s
what
the
sabbatino
court
said
also.
it
said
bernstein
ought
to
not
to
be
extended.
it
happened
at
long
time
ago,
leave
it
alone,
it
gives
us
no
lessons
for
a
different
situation.
so
that
while
i
think
the
sabbatino
case
is
not
inconsistent
with
bernstein,
at
least
it
says
leave
bernstein
alone,
don’t
extend
it
any
further.
if
this
court
for
one
reason
or
another
decides
that
it
will
go
into
the
question
of
the
legality
of
the
cuban
expropriations
that
of
course
is
the
question
that
on
the
sabbatino,
we
should
not
be
discussing
at
all.
i
have
attempted
in
my
brief
to
discuss
the
nature
of
international
law
and
what
the
practice
of
nations
has
been.
international
law
is
supposed
to
be
the
practice
of
nations.
not
the
practice
of
the
united
states
and
great
britain,
but
the
practice
of
all
nations
including
the
soviet
union
and
indonesia
and
china
and
of
the
whole
entity
that
we
in
general
terms
now
called
third
world
or
the
developing
nations
or
as
mr.
justice
harlan
said
the
capital
importing
nations.
and
i
have
attempted
in
an
appendix
to
do
a
job
which
i
hope
was
as
good
as
i
could
do
in
with
the
facilities
i
had
to
show
that
the
practice
of
nations
is
by
no
means
clear.
and
again,
this
was
not
my
thought
because
that’s
what
this
court
again
said
in
sabbatino
that
there
is
great
doubt
about
whether
an
expropriation
under
these
circumstances
is
a
violation
of
international
law
because
there
is
great
doubt
as
to
what
is
the
practice
of
nations.
not
the
morality?
not
the
fifth
amendment
or
the
due
process
legality
of
this
expropriation,
but
the
practice
of
these
expropriations.
what
is
the
practice?
mr.
victor
rabinowitz.
i
don’t
know
that
i
discussed
that
but
your
honor,
there
is
no
--
i’m
glad
you
raised
it.
there
is
no
suggestion
in
this
record
that
this
was
a
discriminatory
expropriation.
every
cuban
bank
was
expropriated
at
the
same
time
as
the
american,
a
couple
of
days
later
perhaps,
as
the
american
bank
was.
this
was
part
of
a
transformation
of
a
government
from
a
capital
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz.
but
i
said
the
same
thing
in
sabbatino,
but
the
court
--
at
least
the
court
of
appeals
disagreed
with
me.
but
the
court
of
appeals
if
the
opinion
will
be
read
carefully,
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
really
think
this
was
wrong
[laughter
attempt]
your
honor,
the
court
of
appeals
in
that
case.
the
court
of
appeals
found
it
discriminatory
and
it
said,
sure
they
confiscated
not
only
american
property,
but
cuban
property
as
well,
but
there
was
a
difference
of
two
weeks.
and
those
two
weeks
where
the
--
three
weeks
or
a
month
perhaps,
but
it
was
a
difference
of
a
few
weeks
in
time,
and
those
few
weeks
where
critical
because
that
what
the
time
of
the
sugar
harvest.
and
that
is
what
made
it
discriminatory
according
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
sabbatino.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz.
but
there
is
no
such
thing
here.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz.
no,
i
do
not
address
myself
to
that
quite
right.
i
should
have
the
next
time
round.
[laughter]
i’ll
try
to.
but
i
did
not
and
i
agree
that
i
should
have
your
honor
but
i
don’t
believe
that
this
was
discriminatory
and
i
don’t
believe
that
any
argument
can
be
or
has
been
made
that
it
was
discriminatory.
now,
as
i
say,
the
--
we
are
not
here
discussing
the
morality
of
the
nationalization.
the
result
of
any
review
of
the
cases
of
the
facts
will
show
enormous
diversity
and
while
it
is
true
that
there
have
been
settlement
reached
and
compensation
paid
in
many
of
these
cases,
never,
never
has
it
been
the
result
of
a
judicial
ruling.
never
has
it
been
because
some
courts
said
this
and
or
that
is
illegal.
it
has
been
the
result
of
the
way
we
settle
international
disputes
in
this
world
by
diplomatic
negotiation,
and
not
by
judicial
interpretation.
the
suggestion
and
the
reason
for
the
state
department’s
letter
in
this
case
is
that
they
want
--
the
state
department
wants
to
protect
foreign
investments
abroad
and
if
i
may
just
have
one
minute.
i
think
the
sabbatino
court
answered
that.
if
a
foreign
developing
country
is
prepared
to
risk
breach
of
diplomatic
relations,
freezing
of
assets,
embargo
on
trade,
embargo
on
travel,
end
of
all
aid
and
a
host
of
other
sanctions
that
the
executive
branch
can
make,
it
seems
to
me
most
unlikely,
that
it
is
going
to
be
upset
by
the
fact
that
a
court
sometime
10
years
hence,
is
going
to
say
that
in
addition,
the
expropriation
was
illegal.
the
sanctions
have
been
applied.
cuba
will
not
get
the
money
as
i
pointed
out
a
moment
ago
and
that
forth
to
take
care
of
that
in
terms
of
the
policy
of
the
united
states.
thank
you.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
pleased
the
court.
i
would
like
preliminarily
to
address
myself
to
two
questions
that
were
placed
by
one
by
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
the
other
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
and
while
they
are
preliminary
and
accent
peripheral
issues,
at
least
one
of
them
may
be
just
positive
of
the
case.
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
don’t
know
why
the
respondent
is
fighting
so
hard
in
this
case.
all
i
know
is
that
i
have
instructions
to
fight
hard
in
this
and
all
of
the
other
cases
which
will
involve
an
increase
in
the
amount
of
the
frozen
funds.
now,
those
funds
where
frozen
by
the
executive
branch
of
the
government,
and
unless
they
are
unfrozen
by
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
or
perhaps
by
congress,
they
are
going
to
remain
frozen
and
will
not
go
to
cuba
and
there
is
no
possibility
at
all
of
them
getting
to
cuba
short
of
an
action
by
the
executive
branch
or
the
legislative
branch,
and
perhaps
that
mean
shorter
from
settlement
of
the
general
dispute
between
the
united
states
and
cuba
which
may
it
may
come
at
sometime
in
the
future
i
assume.
we
all
hope
that
someday,
it
will
come.
but
until
that
day
comes,
i
think
it
maybe
reasonably
certain
that
those
funds
will
remain
frozen.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz.
of
course.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz.
we
want
to
--
i
could
speculate.
i
am
not
authorized
to
speculate
and
given
the
general
public
interest
in
the
fact
that
we
are
dealing
with
it’s
a
government
relations.
i
prefer
not
too.
i
don’t
know
where
i
could
only
guess
as
to
why
the
cuban
government
is
interested
in
carrying
on
this
and
as
i
say
a
great
deal
of
all
the
litigations.
i
think
that
something
maybe
said
in
response
to
justice
blackmun’s
request
for
commission
a
little
while
ago,
mainly
about
what
happens
to
these
frozen
funds
and
what
i
can
tell
you
is
not
what
will
happen
in
the
future,
but
what
has
happened
in
the
past
that
happened
with
respect
to
the
soviet
union,
that
happened
with
respect
to
yugoslavia,
with
respect
to
romania,
with
respect
to
happened
dozen
other
similar
situations
that
frozen
funds
will
collected.
they
remained
and
blocked
accounts
until
one
day
there
was
a
settlement.
and
those
funds
would
then
used
to
pay
for
all
creditors.
in
part
of
course
and
that
is
discussed
and
it
is
the
reason
for
part
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
below
and
i
think
the
first
court
of
appeals
opinion,
and
it
is
the
reason
and
i
think
a
perfectly
valid
reason
for
commenting
that
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
is
seeking
a
windfall,
i
would
prefer
to
call
it
a
preference.
a
preference
over
all
other
persons
who
may
have
claims
and
whose
only
logical
founders,
the
only
way
in
which
they
might
possibly
someday
get
some
return
is
through
a
large
frozen
fund.
now,
whether
my
client
has
that
in
mind,
i
do
not
know
because
i
have
not
been
told
and
as
i
say,
i
prefer
not
to
guess
about
these
things.
but
at
least,
in
factual
terms
and
looking
at
it
historically,
that
is
what
happened
in
the
case
of
the
other
matters
that
i
have
referred
to.
the
eastern
european
countries
generally
and
i
suppose
that
is
the
theory
upon
which
the
funds
will
frozen
in
this
case.
mr.
justice
white
is
likely
responsive
not
vested
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
was
a
law
passed
and
i
think
1963,
vesting
the
funds
and
it
was
until
the
year
later
so
that
the
present
of
funds
are
not
vested,
they
just
held
in
an
account
and
you
cannot
get
money
out
of
the
account
without
a
license
from
the
treasury
department,
and
i
assure
you
those
licenses
are
not
freely
granted.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz.
yes,
sir.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz.
well,
oh
while,
i
will
get
to
that
your
honor.
i
certainly
will
get
to
the
state
department’s
position
here
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states
of
cuba.
it
has
to
do
with
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states
in
which
i
feel
quite
free
to
speculate
because
no
one
would
suggest
that
i
am
expressing
the
views
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
government.
so,
i
will
get
to
that
in
just
a
moment.
i
would
also
like
preliminary
to
say
in
response
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist’s
question
about
this
counterclaim
matter.
we
do
contend
as
was
suggested
that
banco
nacional
is
an
autonomous
government
agency
much
as
i
think
we
have
about
50
autonomous
government
agencies
here
in
the
united
states.
no
one,
i
think
would
content
that
if
the
export
import
bank
where
to
claim
against
anyone
that
he
would
have
the
right
to
counterclaim
against
the
government
of
the
united
states.
even
though
the
funds
of
the
export
import
bank
all
come
ultimately
from
the
treasury
of
the
united
states,
even
though
the
export
import
bank
has
a
board
of
directors
which
is
controlled
exclusively
by
the
united
states,
event
though
the
united
states
created
it
by
statute
and
it
is
the
sole
stockholder,
nevertheless,
it
is
an
autonomous
government
agency
just
as
banco
nacional
is
an
autonomous
government
agency
and
i
think
that
the
record
is
clear
on
that,
and
while
i
think
it
is
a
point
which
would
be
dispositive
of
this
case,
[laughing
attempt]
i
don’t
think
it’s
what
we’re
here
for
to
discuss.
i
would
urge
the
court
as
i
have
in
point
five
of
my
brief
to
decide
the
case
on
that
point.
it
would
be
a
disposition
of
the
manner
in
favor
of
my
clients
it
would
avoid
all
of
these
other
difficult
international
law
problems
and
of
course,
my
client
and
i
would
like
it
and
i
hope
the
court
is
so
disposed.
but
if
it
is
not,
then
obviously,
there
are
other
points
which
are
of
much
greater
consequence.
in
the
petitioner’s
reply
brief
at
page
two,
he
suggests
that
there
are
in
general
too
big
issues
in
this
case.
and
if
i
may
reverse
the
order
of
those
issues
and
trace
them
a
little
less
contentiously,
i
would
agree
and
i
would
formulate
the
issues
as
follows.
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
does
the
act
of
state
doctrine
preclude
the
court
from
considering
the
petitioner’s
claim
that
the
respondent
acted
in
violation
of
international
law?
that’s
the
sabbatino
point
really,
and
it’s
discussed
in
points
one
to
four
of
the
respondent’s
brief.
and
point
two,
if
this
is
answered
in
the
negative,
was
the
nationalization
of
petitioner’s
property
by
the
republic
of
cuba
a
violation
of
international
law?
and
this
is
treated
in
points
i
think
six
or
seven
of
my
brief
in
the
appendix.
now,
the
act
of
state
doctrine
has
been
a
part
of
all
law
at
least
since
1897,
underhill
against
hernandez
and
the
supreme
court,
this
court
in
sabbatino
traced
the
doctrine
back
to
english
presidents
running
back
300
years.
the
most
recent
exposition
of
course
was
the
sabbatino
decision
in
1964
in
which
this
court
in
an
eight
to
one
opinion
upheld
the
doctrine
and
discussed
i
think
most
of
the
reasons
for
the
doctrine
in
great
detail.
and
i
will
not
repeat
the
reasons
for
that
decision,
the
reasons
for
the
act
of
state
doctrine
because
it
would
involve
largely
extensive
quotations
from
this
court’s
opinion
in
sabbatino
and
i
know
that
the
members
of
the
bench
are
familiar
with
it
and
there
is
no
point
in
my
doing
it.
except
to
say
that
i
submit
that
it
is
a
sound
doctrine
which
is
designed
to
keep
this
court
out
of
the
consideration
of
the
second
question,
namely
was
there
a
violation
of
international
law
here?
not
because
the
second
question
is
hard
to
decide,
this
court
gets
lots
of
cases
that
are
hard
to
decide
and
not
because
it’s
important.
because
this
case
--
this
court
gets
lots
of
cases
that
are
important.
but
because
it
necessarily
involves
political
consideration,
political
questions
which
are
best
left
to
the
executive
branch
of
the
government,
and
i
think
some
of
the
implications
of
this
will
appear
in
the
rest
of
my
argument.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz.
it
has
in
this
case.
in
the
sabbatino
case,
it
said
exactly
the
government,
the
opposite.
what
the
next
administration
will
say,
i
do
not
know.
if
there
is
one
thing
which
is
certain
about
our
form
of
government
and
which
is
not
perhaps
true
in
many
places
in
the
world
today,
it’s
that
administration’s
change,
and
that
policy
is
change,
and
just
as
mr.
deputy
attorney
general
katzenbach’s
stood
at
this
podium
seven
years
ago
and
said,
do
not
extend
the
bernstein
doctrine.
we
do
not
want
the
bernstein
doctrine
extended
is
an
embarrassment
to
our
government
to
extend
the
bernstein
doctrine.
so
we
find
the
solicitor
general
of
today
expressing
a
contrary
opinion
and
what
tomorrow’s
solicitor
general
for
legal
advice
and
to
the
state
department
will
say
i
do
not
know.
now,
if
it
is
perfectly
reasonable
and
proper
for
administrations
to
differ
in
policy.
we
expect
that,
that
is
why
we
have
elections
and
that
is
why
one
person
rather
than
another
is
elected
president
and
appoints
his
legal
adviser
and
his
solicitor
general.
it
is
quite
another
think
to
expect
this
court
to
follow
in
the
steps
of
the
administration
in
that
sense.
this
court
is
not
equipped
to,
is
not
expected
to,
and
was
not
intended
by
the
constitution
to
be
an
instrument
of
the
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states
anymore
than
it
is
an
instrument
of
the
domestic
policy
of
the
united
states.
this
court
is
to
decide
things
on
the
basis
of
law,
and
the
law
--
unless
this
court
is
prepared
to
reverse
sabbatino,
the
law
is
the
sabbatino
case,
and
on
the
basis
of
the
sabbatino
case,
this
court
has
set
and
i
can
think
of
no
better
way
of
saying
it
than
the
way
mr.
justice
harlan
did.
he
said
the
act
of
state
doctrine
has
constitutional
underpinnings.
it
arises
out
of
the
basic
relationships
between
branches
of
government
in
a
system
of
separation
of
powers.
it
could
turn
the
competency
of
these
similar
institutions
to
make
and
implement
particular
kinds
of
decisions
in
the
area
of
international
relations.
the
doctrine
is
formulated
and
passed
decisions
expresses
the
strong
sense
of
the
judicial
branch
that
its
engagement
in
the
test
of
passing
on
the
validity
of
foreign
acts
of
state
may
hinder
rather
than
further
this
country’s
pursuit
of
goal
both
for
itself
and
for
the
community
of
nations
as
a
whole
in
the
international
sphere.
now,
i
know
that
the
legal
advice
to
the
state
department
now
disagrees
with
that
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
next
sentence
in
mr.
justice
harlan
opinion
is,
many
commentators
disagree
with
this
view.
i
know
that
they
disagree
with
this
view.
one
of
the
persons
who
disagrees
with
this
view
is
mr.
justice
white,
but
the
fact
is
that
the
sabbatino
decision
discussed
all
of
these
and
discuss
it
in
considerable
detail
and
came
to
a
conclusion
which
i
submit
is
as
sound
today
as
it
was
in
1964.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz.
thank
you.
[laughing
attempt]
i
knew
you
would
not,
your
honor.
[laughter]
it
is
not
within
the
competency
of
this
court
with
all
due
respect
to
it,
to
get
involve
in
complicated
and
difficult
question
involving
the
application
of
the
international
policy
of
the
united
states.
now,
let
me
give
you
an
example
which
is
not
hypothetical
at
all.
the
cuban
expropriations
here
took
place
in
i
think
1960,
almost
immediately,
the
state
department
issued
a
statement
saying
these
confiscations
are
violations
of
international
law.
state
departments
always
do
that
in
this
kind
of
situation
and
i
assume,
it
is
done
in
pursuit
of
the
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states.
these
confiscations
are
illegal.
now,
we
are
here
10
years,
11
years
later,
we
could
have
been
on
the
other
circumstance
than
here
greatly
or
sooner.
and
one
of
the
issues
that
is
presented
to
this
court
is
where
those
confiscations
violations
of
international
law?
suppose
this
court
after
consideration
of
the
law
should
be
impelled
as
i
would
urge
it
to
hold
that
it
was
not
a
violation
of
international
law
at
all.
this
court
would
then
be
placed
in
a
position
of
having
to
disagree
with
the
state
department
on
a
question
on
which
the
state
department
has
expressed
itself
not
once,
but
many
times.
i
submit
that
this
court
should
not
be
placed
in
that
position.
this
court
should
not
be
placed
in
the
position
where
it
may
be
called
upon
to
express
opinions
on
questions
of
international
law
which
are
contrary
to
the
opinions
expressed
by
the
executive
branch
in
pursuit
of
its
foreign
policy.
not
this
court’s
foreign
policy,
but
the
executive
branches
foreign
policy
because
that’s
its
responsibility.
and
this
court
ought
not
to
be
placed
in
a
position
where
it
has
that
responsibility
which
as
i
say
with
all
respect
to
this
court,
it
is
not
equipped
the
count.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz.
yes,
sir.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz.
oh!
no,
sir.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz.
i
am
limiting
to
the
questions
of
the
validity
of
the
acts
of
the
foreign
sovereign
gone
within
its
territory.
and
this
i
say,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
the
position
that
the
petitioner
here
is
advocating
rights
as
this
very
serious
danger
in
connection
with
the
separation
of
power.
now
this
case
is
exactly,
i
might
just
to
dispose
for
a
moment
of
this
hickenlooper
amendment
point,
i
don’t
know
what
is
really
argued
seriously.
the
hickenlooper
amendment
is
drawn
in
very,
very
narrow
language.
the
language
is
very
hard
to
understand,
and
i
am
not
going
to
try
to
read
it
here.
it
can
require
very
careful
study
and
i
have
tried
to
analyze
it
my
brief
so
that
to
be
of
assistance
to
the
court
but
it
can’t
very
well
be
done
on
our
oral
argument.
the
court
of
appeals
held
and
here
the
court
was
unanimous
that
the
hickenlooper
amendment
did
not
apply
to
this
kind
of
situation
at
all,
would
never
intended
to
apply
in
this
situation
that
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york
has
also
held
with
the
hickenlooper
amendment
is
to
be
given
a
very
narrow
reading
and
did
not
apply
to
a
situation
before
it
in
the
french
case
so
that
the
hickenlooper
amendment
--
i
really
don’t
think
has
anything
do
to
with
this
case
and
i
think
this
court
when
it
gets
to
analyze
it
in
detail
will
come
to
the
same
conclusion.
what
is
much
more
important
is
not
the
hickenlooper
amendment
but
the
letter
of
mr.
stevenson.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz.
i
have
argued
it
so,
yes.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz.
yes.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz.
frankly,
your
honor.
you
have
expressed
it
even
better
than
i
did.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz.
i
agree.
i
think
the
hickenlooper
amendment
is
unconstitutional
because
it
is
an
economic
part
of
congress
to
tell
this
court
what
it
may
or
may
not.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz.
no,
sir.
if
it
doesn’t
apply,
i
don’t
think
it
is
relevant.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz.
well,
it
is
direction
to
this
court
which
it
constitutional
i
suppose
this
court
has
to
follow
that
in
certain
kind
cases.
not
this
kind
but
other
kinds
of
cases,
the
act
of
state
doctrine
shall
be
suspended.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz.
might.
i
suppose
that.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz.
now,
we
have
here
an
expression
by
a
legal
adviser
to
the
state
department
which
seeks
to
undercut
the
act
of
state
doctrine.
and
while
the
legal
advice
limit
to
his
contentional
or
has
lead
it
to
counterclaims,
i
really
don’t
understand
why
because
all
of
his
arguments
go
to
anytime
on
the
claim.
and
once
we
eliminate
the
counterclaim
element,
there
is
nothing
new
about
this
proposal.
the
proposal
in
effect
is
a
suggestion
that
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
shall
have
the
right
to
tell
the
court
either
to
apply
or
not
to
apply
the
act
of
state
doctrine.
now,
that
is
not
a
new
proposal.
it
was
made
first
when
mr.
stevenson
was
the
chairman
of
the
international
law
committee
of
the
bar
association
of
the
city
of
new
york
in
1959.
it
was
repeated
by
mr.
stevenson
when
he
was
writing
for
the
probably
american
chamber
of
international
law
in
about
1953.
it
was
discussed
by
the
court
in
the
sabbatino
case.
it
is
as
i
read
it
a
position
that
is
endorsed
by
mr.
justice
white
or
was
in
his
opinion,
in
his
dissenting
opinion
and
it
was
opposed
--
it
was
opposed
most
vigorously
by
mr.
katzenbach
and
by
the
solicitor
general
in
the
last
administration,
and
the
court
in
the
sabbatino
case
disapproved
it,
and
it
disapproved
it
for
reasons
that
are
set
forth
in
the
sabbatino
decision
and
nothing
new
has
happened.
except
that
whereas
the
last
administration
has
said
this
is
not
a
business
for
the
executive
branch
for
the
court
at
all
and
we
will
take
care
of
our
own
foreign
policy.
we
don’t
need
the
court
to
get
mixed
up
in
it
because
who
knows
how
the
court’s
going
to
decide.
it
is
really
uncontrollable.
we
don’t
know
how
the
court
is
going
to
decide
any
particular
question
and
therefore,
we
would
assume
that
the
court
stay
out
and
it
referred
over
and
over
again
to
the
possibility
of
embarrassment
to
the
executive
branch
because
we
do
not
know
how
the
court
will
decide
the
case.
now,
this
administration
differs
and
while
as
i
say,
mr.
stevenson,
of
course,
is
quite
consistent
he
took
this
position
while
in
private
factors,
he
took
this
position
as
editor
of
the
journal
and
he
takes
his
position
now
and
it
is
quite
proper
that
he
should
be
consistent
and
it
is
quite
proper
that
the
administration
should
change
when
the
administration
changes,
but
that
is
not
the
problem
of
this
court.
the
problem
of
this
court
is
to
apply
a
doctrine
which
is
80
years
old
at
least
in
our
court
and
which
was
most
recently
affirmed
in
sabbatino
and
no
new
reasons
have
been
suggested
why
that
doctrine
should
not
be
applied
at
this
point.
now,
once
we
get
passed
if
this
court
should
decide
that
the
act
of
state
doctrine
is
not
to
be
applied
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz.
i
think
not.
i
think
that
bernstein
was
a
freak.
i
think
the
case
was
a
sport.
it
arose
in
the
situation
which
is
very
difficult
to
duplicate.
the
facts
were
most
unusual
and
it’s
one
of
those
cases
which
because
it
involved
the
hitler
government
because
it
involved
the
terrible
excesses
against
persons
of
jewish
faith
at
the
seizure
of
property
under
circumstances
which
we
are
all
familiar
with,
and
because
the
government
was
no
longer
an
existence
presented
a
situation
which
is
i
say
is
sui
generis.
it’s
his
own
situation
and
this
is
exactly
i
mean,
this
is
not
my
idea,
this
is
exactly,
it
is
not
only
my
idea,
this
is
exactly
what
the
solicitor
general
said
in
the
brief
he
submitted
in
sabbatino.
he
said
it
is
exceedingly
narrow
situation
and
i
commend
the
reading
of
that
brief
too
your
honor.
it
is
exceedingly
narrow
case.
it
ought
not
be
extended
at
all.
it
arose
at
the
very
unusual
facts
which
are
not
duplicated
here
and
this
court,
the
supreme
court
has
been
the
past
on
it
in
effect
let’s
--
let
it
rest.
let’s
not
resurrect
it.
and
as
i
read
the
sabbatino
opinion,
that’s
what
the
sabbatino
court
said
also.
it
said
bernstein
ought
to
not
to
be
extended.
it
happened
at
long
time
ago,
leave
it
alone,
it
gives
us
no
lessons
for
a
different
situation.
so
that
while
i
think
the
sabbatino
case
is
not
inconsistent
with
bernstein,
at
least
it
says
leave
bernstein
alone,
don’t
extend
it
any
further.
if
this
court
for
one
reason
or
another
decides
that
it
will
go
into
the
question
of
the
legality
of
the
cuban
expropriations
that
of
course
is
the
question
that
on
the
sabbatino,
we
should
not
be
discussing
at
all.
i
have
attempted
in
my
brief
to
discuss
the
nature
of
international
law
and
what
the
practice
of
nations
has
been.
international
law
is
supposed
to
be
the
practice
of
nations.
not
the
practice
of
the
united
states
and
great
britain,
but
the
practice
of
all
nations
including
the
soviet
union
and
indonesia
and
china
and
of
the
whole
entity
that
we
in
general
terms
now
called
third
world
or
the
developing
nations
or
as
mr.
justice
harlan
said
the
capital
importing
nations.
and
i
have
attempted
in
an
appendix
to
do
a
job
which
i
hope
was
as
good
as
i
could
do
in
with
the
facilities
i
had
to
show
that
the
practice
of
nations
is
by
no
means
clear.
and
again,
this
was
not
my
thought
because
that’s
what
this
court
again
said
in
sabbatino
that
there
is
great
doubt
about
whether
an
expropriation
under
these
circumstances
is
a
violation
of
international
law
because
there
is
great
doubt
as
to
what
is
the
practice
of
nations.
not
the
morality?
not
the
fifth
amendment
or
the
due
process
legality
of
this
expropriation,
but
the
practice
of
these
expropriations.
what
is
the
practice?
mr.
victor
rabinowitz.
i
don’t
know
that
i
discussed
that
but
your
honor,
there
is
no
--
i’m
glad
you
raised
it.
there
is
no
suggestion
in
this
record
that
this
was
a
discriminatory
expropriation.
every
cuban
bank
was
expropriated
at
the
same
time
as
the
american,
a
couple
of
days
later
perhaps,
as
the
american
bank
was.
this
was
part
of
a
transformation
of
a
government
from
a
capital
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz.
but
i
said
the
same
thing
in
sabbatino,
but
the
court
--
at
least
the
court
of
appeals
disagreed
with
me.
but
the
court
of
appeals
if
the
opinion
will
be
read
carefully,
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
really
think
this
was
wrong
[laughter
attempt]
your
honor,
the
court
of
appeals
in
that
case.
the
court
of
appeals
found
it
discriminatory
and
it
said,
sure
they
confiscated
not
only
american
property,
but
cuban
property
as
well,
but
there
was
a
difference
of
two
weeks.
and
those
two
weeks
where
the
--
three
weeks
or
a
month
perhaps,
but
it
was
a
difference
of
a
few
weeks
in
time,
and
those
few
weeks
where
critical
because
that
what
the
time
of
the
sugar
harvest.
and
that
is
what
made
it
discriminatory
according
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
sabbatino.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz.
but
there
is
no
such
thing
here.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz.
no,
i
do
not
address
myself
to
that
quite
right.
i
should
have
the
next
time
round.
[laughter]
i’ll
try
to.
but
i
did
not
and
i
agree
that
i
should
have
your
honor
but
i
don’t
believe
that
this
was
discriminatory
and
i
don’t
believe
that
any
argument
can
be
or
has
been
made
that
it
was
discriminatory.
now,
as
i
say,
the
--
we
are
not
here
discussing
the
morality
of
the
nationalization.
the
result
of
any
review
of
the
cases
of
the
facts
will
show
enormous
diversity
and
while
it
is
true
that
there
have
been
settlement
reached
and
compensation
paid
in
many
of
these
cases,
never,
never
has
it
been
the
result
of
a
judicial
ruling.
never
has
it
been
because
some
courts
said
this
and
or
that
is
illegal.
it
has
been
the
result
of
the
way
we
settle
international
disputes
in
this
world
by
diplomatic
negotiation,
and
not
by
judicial
interpretation.
the
suggestion
and
the
reason
for
the
state
department’s
letter
in
this
case
is
that
they
want
--
the
state
department
wants
to
protect
foreign
investments
abroad
and
if
i
may
just
have
one
minute.
i
think
the
sabbatino
court
answered
that.
if
a
foreign
developing
country
is
prepared
to
risk
breach
of
diplomatic
relations,
freezing
of
assets,
embargo
on
trade,
embargo
on
travel,
end
of
all
aid
and
a
host
of
other
sanctions
that
the
executive
branch
can
make,
it
seems
to
me
most
unlikely,
that
it
is
going
to
be
upset
by
the
fact
that
a
court
sometime
10
years
hence,
is
going
to
say
that
in
addition,
the
expropriation
was
illegal.
the
sanctions
have
been
applied.
cuba
will
not
get
the
money
as
i
pointed
out
a
moment
ago
and
that
forth
to
take
care
of
that
in
terms
of
the
policy
of
the
united
states.
thank
you.
