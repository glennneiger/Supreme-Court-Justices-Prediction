mr.
slater,
that
was
1967,
you
said?
unknown
speaker
let
me
get
back
to
my
question.
that
was
1967?
unknown
speaker
no,
you
were
preparing
i
think
1977
as
a
date.
that’s
a
full
decade.
unknown
speaker
as
you
know,
years
ago,
new
york
took
it
--
new
york
city
took
its
garbage
out
to
the
sea
and
there
out
and
dumped
it
and
then
tides
brought
it
in
to
new
jersey
as
pretty
much
what
milwaukee
is
doing
to
with
illinois,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
or
sewage
not
garbage
but
i
mean,
it’s
the
same
--
unknown
speaker
i’m
sure
you
do.
i’m
not
--
my
question
was
merely
this,
court
just
recommend
that
illinois
go
to
the
wisconsin
courts?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
say
about
the
collecting
case,
our
collecting
case.
unknown
speaker
that
was
the
case
where
wisconsin
was
not
wanting
to
go
into
the
state
of
illinois,
right?
unknown
speaker
as
far
as
the
conference
goes,
i
follow
up
all
of
them.
i
think
you’re
about
57
up
to
last
year
and
then
i
gave
up
because
there’s
many
other
things
happening
but
i
didn’t
find
that
one
that
had
resulted
in
anything
being
accomplished.
did
anything
happen
do
you
know.
have
you
followed
those
57
--
(voice
overlap)
unknown
speaker
where
is
the
(inaudible)
in
the
conference?
isn't
it
more
or
less
than
just
a
get
together
and
having
a
few
things
to
talk
of
things
over?
unknown
speaker
well,
i’m
not
talking
about
that.
i’m
talking
about
the
interstate
conference.
unknown
speaker
yes,
the
illinois
then
involved
in
other
conference
proceedings
under
the
federal
act?
unknown
speaker
it’s
going
on
for
five
years?
unknown
speaker
i
might
be
--
you
might
be
encouraged
to
note
that
some
of
them
that
i
was
following
last
year
have
gone
on
for
eleven
years
with
nothing
happening.
