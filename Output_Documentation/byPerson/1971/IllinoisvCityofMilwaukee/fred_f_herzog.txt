mr.
fred
f.
herzog
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
motion
by
the
state
of
illinois
asking
this
court
for
a
leave
to
file
a
bill
of
complaint
against
various
wisconsin
municipalities
including
and
foremost
the
city
of
milwaukee
which
as
you
know
quite
well
contains
within
its
boundaries,
the
greatest
concentration
of
people
and
industry
in
the
state
of
wisconsin.
now,
the
bill
of
complaint
is
quite
simple.
it
merely
charges
that
huge
amounts
of
raw
sewage
and
inadequately
treated
sewage
are
dumped
everyday
into
the
waters
of
lake
michigan
that
these
waters
thereby
become
contaminated
and
that
these
polluted
waters
find
their
way
into
the
illinois
territory
where
this
severely
and
i
mean
severely
endanger
the
life
and
health
of
many
residents
of
the
state
of
illinois.
actually,
in
this
particular
instance,
the
department
of
natural
resources
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
which
is
the
agency
which
deals
with
water
pollution
matters
in
the
state
of
wisconsin
has
estimated
that
200
million
gallons
a
day,
200
million
gallons
a
day
in
the
milwaukee
area
alone
are
discharged
into
the
waters
of
lake
michigan.
now,
this
is
not
a
small
matter.
and
it
is
not
a
small
matter
as
we
in
illinois
are
concerned
therewith.
we
in
illinois,
i
must
put
here
the
matter
straight
in
this
instance
have
actually
done
everything
possible
to
wipe
out
pollution.
of
course,
there
are
some
spots
which
are
remaining
but
it
was
through
efforts
of
our
attorney
general
who
is
sitting
next
to
me
here
that
we
have
accomplished
that.
and
i
might
say
here
in
this
instance
that
we
cannot
tolerate
and
suffer
that
such
an
epidemic,
a
possible
epidemic
lurks
behind
every
way
which
really
finds
its
way
into
the
illinois
region.
we
are
familiar,
unfortunately,
in
illinois
with
such
an
epidemic.
in
18
--
the
1880’s,
the
city
of
chicago
dumped
raw
sewage
into
lake
michigan.
the
consequence
was
one
of
the
severest
typhoid
epidemics
which
ever
hit
the
city
of
chicago
--
having
shrink
the
population
of
chicago
and
it
was
at
that
time
that
the
chicago
sanitary
district
was
created
where
the
flow
of
the
rivers
as
you
might
know
is
reversed
and
for
a
--
nothing
goes
into
lake
michigan
on
this
instance.
we
have
--
we
are
actually
here
in
this
particular
instance,
we
have
really
a
situation
where
sovereign
interest
clash
with
each
other.
although
the
suit
is
filed
by
us
performer
against
various
wisconsin
municipalities,
in
reality
--
in
political
reality
and
in
effect
it
is
directed
against
the
state
of
wisconsin.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
respondents
all
in
their
briefs
say
and
emphasize
that
they
are
controlled
by
the
department
of
natural
resources
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
which
are
just
indicate
that
this
--
the
agency
which
is
in
charge
of
water
pollution
matters
particularly
those
concerned
in
lake
michigan.
therefore,
we
have
here,
as
i
indicate
it
a
clash
of
such
sovereign
interests,
the
municipalities
and
state
agencies
merely
being
the
bearers
of
the
sovereign
police
power
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
in
the
field
of
public
health.
under
these
circumstances,
i
respectfully
suggest
that
if
you
have
such
a
clash
of
sovereign
interest,
the
exercise
of
original
jurisdiction
approaches
the
constitutional
mandate
--
i
might
even
say
it
becomes
mandatory
here
in
this
instance.
we
have
an
example
here
too,
in
the
case
of
missouri
versus
illinois,
although
the
illinois
they
have
--
the
state
of
illinois
was
made
to
perform
party.
the
real
culprit
if
i
may
say
so
was
the
chicago
sanitary
district
against
which
the
complaint
was
levied
by
the
state
of
missouri
and
there
reached
--
original
jurisdiction
was
exercised.
mr.
fred
f.
herzog
yes,
they
handle
it
presently
different.
first
of
all,
as
far
as
we
made
this
concern,
it
belongs
to
the
matter
to
the
area
of
the
chicago
metropolitan
sanitary
district.
hence,
their
extensive
treatment
is
provided
and
it
doesn’t
go
into
lake
michigan
but
as
far
as
waukegan
is
concerned
and
to
the
communities
in
the
north
shore
sanitary
district,
they
are
presently
under
orders
of
our
pollution
control
board,
the
foul
water
control
--
pollution
control
board
not
to
emit
any
sewage
into
lake
michigan.
so,
they
do
handle
it
differently.
as
i
said,
due
to
our
efforts
and
the
persistent
efforts
which
we
have
made
in
this
field.
now,
being
here,
a
clash
of
inter-controversy
involving
sovereign
interest,
i
have
indicated
that
really
original
jurisdiction
is
almost
mandatory
in
this
instance.
however,
even
if
they
alleviate
form
or
the
substance
in
this
instance
and
say,
“well,
the
complaint
is
really
not
directed
officially
against
the
state
of
wisconsin.”
nevertheless,
i
can
only
reemphasize
again
that
these
state
agencies
and
these
municipal
corporations
and
i
might
say
that
one
of
the
agency
is
actually
a
state
agency
namely
the
milwaukee
--the
sewerage
commission
of
the
county
of
milwaukee
where
they
may
emphasize
appointed
by
the
governor
of
the
state
of
wisconsin.
but
as
i
said,
even
if
he
looked
at
these
municipalities,
nevertheless,
they
are
the
bearers
of
sovereign
interest.
they
carry
out
within
their
territory
the
police
power
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
in
the
field
of
public
health.
the
question
has
been
asked
by
this
court,
“if
the
court
exercises
jurisdiction,
what
law
would
apply?”
well,
we
submit
here
that
federal
common
law
must
apply
in
such
an
instance.
it
must
apply
because
the
mere
idea
of
sovereignty
demands
the
application
of
such
a
law.
it
cannot
be
a
state
law
although
maybe
the
federal
court
here
can
freely
draw
from
state
resources
of
law.
about
the
law
which
is
applied
is
federal
law
--
a
federal
law
which
has
to
take
into
consideration
the
equality
of
the
sovereigns
which
are
involved
and
has
to
take
into
consideration
the
backdrop
of
various
federal
laws
which
will
come
into
play.
mr.
fred
f.
herzog
a
congress
is
free
and
about
to
--
i’m
sorry
to
say
that
the
entire
bill
both
laid
on
congressional
report
here,
in
this
instance,
that
congress
has
actually
delegated
the
power
here
to
the
various
states.
as
far
as
what
the
quality
standards
are
concerned.
thankfully,
in
my
humble
opinion,
this
is
a
drawback
in
this
instance.
that
it
is
left
to
the
individual
states
to
control
even
water
pollution
and
to
control
it
where
actually
in
these
interstate
disputes,
there
are
sovereign
interests
clash
with
each
other.
mr.
fred
f.
herzog
no,
mr.
justice
white,
i
really
believe
here
in
this
instance
that
under
the
constitutional
mandate
of
article
3
where
the
court
must
really
hear
controversies
which
are
in
effect
between
states,
this
court
must
fashion
its
own
law
and
cannot
--
mr.
fred
f.
herzog
irregardless
here
in
this
instance
of
congress
an
overwriting
law
of
congress
which
says
that
in
this
instance,
federal
--
certain
federal
principles
must
be
applied
which
hasn’t
been
the
case
here.
mr.
fred
f.
herzog
well,
i
--
indeed
in
this
instance,
frankly
i
question
where
the
congress
can
tell
this
court
what
law
to
apply
in
cases
of
original
jurisdiction
to
be
decided
on
the
article
three
of
the
constitution.
mr.
fred
f.
herzog
no.
it
hasn’t
clearly
acted
in
this
matter.
it
hasn’t
clearly
as
far
as
the
federal
law
is
concerned.
it
is
left
to
the
individual
states
really
the
resolution
of
the
problems.
and
it
provided
eventually
if
a
state
asks
for
an
interstate
enforcement
conference
and
there
it
wasn’t
said
what
law
should
be
applied
here,
or
what
rule
should
be
applied
in
this
instance.
so,
it
was
all
left
up
hanging
in
the
air
and
thankfully,
this
is
a
whole
drawback
of
these
interstate
enforcement
conferences.
they
haven’t
worked
and
i
will
indicate
why
they
haven’t
work.
but
be
that
does
it
may,
we
respectfully
submit
here
that
this
is
a
complete
--
this
is
really
the
controversy
between
sovereigns
as
i
have
repeatedly
mentioned
that
the
controversy
here
in
this
instance
which
really
pertains
to
the
use
of
water.
and
if
we
have
such
a
controversy
pertaining
to
the
use
of
water,
mr.
justice
brandeis
here
speaking
for
this
court
in
the
hinderlider
case
which
we
have
quoted
in
our
brief
said
the
following:
“for
whether
the
water
of
an
interstate
stream
must
be
apportioned
between
the
two
states
as
accretion
of
federal
common
law
upon
which
neither
the
statutes
nor
the
decisions
of
either
state
can
be
conclusive.
now
--
mr.
fred
f.
herzog
correct,
your
honor.
but
to
that,
there
is
another
point
here.
it
refers
here
characteristically
his
authority
to
this
case
of
new
jersey
versus
new
york
in
which
actually
that
--
it
was
really
new
york
city
in
which
actually
new
york
city
dumped
its
garbage
into
the
ocean
and
there
the
garbage
was
deposited
if
there
was
an
ill
wind
on
the
shores
of
the
state
of
new
jersey
and
there
were
federal
laws
in
existence.
they
were
--
walked
on
the
harbors
act
of
1899
was
at
this
time
in
existence.
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
was
in
existence
and
actually
the
harbor
mess
of
new
york
at
that
time
gave
to
the
city
of
new
york
the
expressed
permission
to
dumped
in
that
places
where
they
dumped.
nevertheless
here,
this
court
took
a
jurisdiction
and
this
court
decided
here
in
this
particular
instance
that
the
action
was
improper.
i
might
say
here
that
much
is
made
by
the
defendants
of
the
fact
here.
that
there
is
that
federal
water
quality
act
of
1965
or
the
federal
water
pollution
control
act
which
provides
for
an
enforcement
conference
and
the
--
a
remedy
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
if
requested
by
the
administrator
originally
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
now
by
the
administrator
of
the
environmental
protection
agency.
first
of
all,
let
me
emphasize
that
this
remedy
is
not
the
remedy
which
is
even
to
the
state.
it
is
a
remedy
which
is
solely
in
the
discretion
of
the
federal
government.
and
during
22
years,
there
was
one
single
case
where
the
attorney
general
actually
utilized
that
remedy,
apparently,
wasn’t
asked
here
either
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
or
by
the
administrator
of
the
environmental
agency.
and
what
did
this
administrator
say
about
the
effectiveness
of
that
remedy
which
is
supposedly
and
allegedly
provided
here
in
the
federal
law.
this
simply
state
that
you
didn’t
--
it
didn’t
work
at
all.
we
have
pointed
it
out
in
our
brief.
i
want
to
quote
in
a
letter
to
representative
albert,
the
speaker
of
the
house,
he
said,
“these
major
score
of
pollution
control
of
interstate
waters
have
not
proved
sufficiently
strong
and
and
affect
people.”
now,
we
are
not
really
the
persons
who
say
that
these
remedies
have
not
proven
effective,
it
was
the
u.s.
senate,
who
so
held
on
november
2,
1971,
that
the
barely
three
months
ago.
there
on
november
2,
when
they
passed
unanimously
86
to
nothing,
the
new
act,
the
house
hasn’t
take
to
ban
it.
they
are
the
committee
on
public
works
after
two
years
of
study
of
the
federal
water
pollution
control,
go
over
them
and
i’m
quoting,
“concludes
that
the
national
effort
to
abate
and
control
water
pollution
is
inadequate
in
every
vital
aspect.
rivers,
lakes
and
streams
are
being
used
to
dispose
of
man’s
waste
rather
than
to
support
man’s
life
and
health.
and
the
use
of
any
river,
lakes,
stream
or
ocean
as
a
waste
treatment
system
is
unacceptable.
and
they
said
this
was
due
to
the
time
schedules
for
abatement
are
slipping
away,
because
of
failure
to
enforce
lack
of
effluent
controls
and
disputes
over
federal
state
standards.”
this
is
a
work,
i
might
say
of
senator
muskie
who
reported
here
this
bill
in
behalf
of
the
committee
on
public
works.
now,
what
are
the
effects
hereof
the
michigan
and
state
enforcement
conference?
it
was
the
state
of
illinois
as
the
only
state
which
in
1967
asked
for
that
convening
of
that
conference
because
we
were
eventually
afraid
of
these
wastes
which
come
every
day
into
the
state
of
illinois.
we
were
afraid
because
all
our
efforts
would
be
set
to
not
and
would
be
futile
if
we
couldn’t
act
here
in
this
instance
against
the
neighboring
states.
and
therefore,
we
asked
for
the
convening
of
the
conference.
this
is
unlike,
i
might
say,
ohio
versus
wyandotte
where
there
was
at
lake
erie
conference
which
was
in
existence
only
for
one
year
before
the
suit
was
filed.
in
1968,
the
first
conference
met.
there
were
high
sounding
declarations
of
that
--
the
state
should
cooperate
in
the
pollution
control
abatement
programs,
deadlines
were
set,
operations
schedules
provided.
but
what
came
of
it?
in
1969,
the
second
conference
met.
and
again
there
were
broken
deadlines.
some
of
the
municipalities
didn’t
even
start.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
one
of
the
municipalities
here
involved
has
a
1967
deadline
to
the
goal
to
enlarge
their
sewage
treatment
facilities,
it
has
still
not
complied
with
these
schedules.
in
1970,
the
third
conference
met
and
it
meant
significantly
in
the
city
of
milwaukee
because
the
chairman
of
the
conference
who
is
a
federal
official
turns
to
the
representative
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
and
i’m
quoting
what
he
said,
“but
the
point
is
that
the
biggest
city
in
us
state,
milwaukee
wounded
discharges
into
lake
michigan.
the
water
that
we
have
a
real
high
priority
to
protect
is
in
clear
violation
of
this
conference
recommendation.
they
are
more
than
two
years
late
on
disinfection
of
the
effluent
and
the
lack
of
putting
out
this
disinfection
means
that
pathogens
go
into
the
lake.
now,
these
are
the
bold
facts
as
i
see
them.
the
largest
city
in
this
state
is
not
disinfecting
its
effluent.
well,
then
be
learned
this
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
fred
f.
herzog
no,
we
have
no
such
remedy.
we
can’t
go
to
the
federal
conference,
we
can’t
eventually
ask
for
a
hearing
board
but
then
after
the
hearing
and
by
the
way,
i
might
say
that
contrary
to
what
the
state
and
in
the
respondents’
brief,
we
would
not
have
a
remedy
under
the
administrative
review
act
because
under
the
administrative
review
act,
such
remedy
would
not
be
in
existence
if
a
decision
is
made
by
a
representative
body.
i
think
it
is
section
7
of
the
administrative
review
board.
they
would
not
have
a
remedy.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
have
no
remedy
under
the
state
law
unlike
ohio
versus
wyandotte.
we
could
not
go
into
the
state
of
illinois.
yes,
we
could
sue
them
under
a
long-armed
statute.
how
are
we
going
to
enforce
particularly
in
an
injunctive
decree
against
milwaukee,
against
the
sovereign
agencies
of
another
state?
yes,
they
recognize.
it’s
the
same
is
to
--
with
the
federal
court,
we
do
not
qualify
as
a
citizen
under
the
diversity
proceedings
which
is
recognized
also
by
this
court
in
the
wyandotte
case.
we
could
not.
yes,
we
could
go
as
suggested
and
i
can
only
take
this
suggestion
almost
that
procedures
that
we
should
go
to
the
department
of
natural
resources
of
wisconsin
and
ask
for
a
relief.
this
is
if
you
would
say
here,
the
sheep
should
go
to
the
wolf
and
ask
here
to
meet
our
justice
amongst
them.
this
is
the
very
person,
these
are
the
various
agencies
which
tolerate
that
condition
here
and
what
did
about
--
by
the
way
as
far
as
the
enforcement
conference
is
concerned,
what
did
wisconsin
save
in
the
conference
may
emphasize,
but
you
have
changed
these
deadlines
unilaterally.
they
said,
“well,
it’s
true,
we
did
so
but
we
consulted
the
federal
water
quality
administration
and
then
they
say
here,
and
this
is
characteristic,
this
is
a
quotation
from
their
report
to
the
conference,
“it
should
be
further
noted
that
there
are
no
published
rules
or
regulations
or
guidelines
that
have
been
promulgated
by
the
department
of
the
interior
to
give
specific
guidelines
and
details
on
how
this
whole
area
of
joint
enforcement
of
standards
and
recommendations
should
be
administered.
we
consider
the
lack
of
such
rule
to
be
a
substantial
weakness
in
conference
procedures.”
that’s
their
own
words!
they
really
denigrate
here
the
whole
procedure
as
such
and
nothing
is
left.
if
it
please
this
court
here,
this
is
not
the
question
as
i
have
said
of
property,
this
is
a
question
literally
and
this
is
not
high-sounding
oratory.
this
is
a
question
of
human
lives
which
are
involved.
we
might
be
saying,
we
are
equally
concern
or
the
lives
of
the
citizens
of
wisconsin
but
we
have
noted
about
these
humane
concern
for
the
wisconsin
residents
cannot
be
translated
by
us
into
redirection
but
it
can
be
translated
by
us
into
redirection
as
far
as
residents
of
the
state
of
illinois
are
concerned.
and
we
are
under
a
duty
under
federal
water
quality
act,
places
a
responsibility
for
action
foremost
in
the
states.
this
is
a
constant
theme
of
the
federal
water
quality
act
in
the
policy
statement
and
even
in
the
statement
where
--
which
deals
with
the
enforcement
provisions,
which
deals
with
the
conference.
there
it
says,
“state
actions
shall
not
be
displaced
by
an
action
of
the
federal
government
unless
the
court
do
what
they
have
been
issued
and
of
course,
never
been
issued.
so,
under
these
circumstances,
where
there
is
no
other
remedy
available
to
us,
at
least
no
other
reasonable
remedy
and
where
we
surely
are
not
going
to
subject
our
sovereign
interest
to
an
administrative
agency
of
the
state
of
wisconsin.
and
where
sovereign
interest
clash,
i
must
respectfully
submit
that
the
exercise
of
original
jurisdiction
is
the
only
thing
which
is
left.
everyday
which
goes
by
cause
to
see
irreparable
harm
and
to
postpone
the
deadlines
simply
would
not
do
anymore.
we
have
waited
three
years,
four
years,
now
five
years
and
by
the
way
the
situation
still
hasn’t
been
corrected.
in
the
latest
brief
of
the
milwaukee
sewerage
commission
on
page
six,
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
they
talked
of
one
of
their
treatment
plants,
let’s
say
primary
treatment
is
operative
of
the
other.
you
know
what
this
means
in
the
parlance
of
the
health
authorities.
primary
treatments
means
that
the
solids
merely
are
taken
out
which
is
nothing
--absolutely
nothing
--
as
far
as
health
is
concerned.
secondary
treatment
is
demanded
when
at
least
90%
--
85%
or
90%
of
the
solids
are
removed
and
nowadays,
we
have
recognized
that
even
secondary
treatment
in
many
instances
is
not
sufficient.
i
respectfully
urge
this
court
here
to
exercise
jurisdiction.
unlike
wyandotte
versus
ohio,
this
is
not
where
a
private
individuals
are
involved.
this
is
a
suit
between
sovereigns
and
unlike
wyandotte,
no
other
remedy
at
least
attach
it
to
remedy
is
available
to
the
state
of
illinois
which
will
prevent
the
irreparable
harm.
mr.
fred
f.
herzog
just
a
minute.
mr.
fred
f.
herzog
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
about
these
huge
expenditures
of
money,
let
me
quote
only
here
one
instance
from
the
conference,
the
third
conference
which
took
place
in
1970.
there
the
question
arose
how
much
it
would
cost
to
disinfect
the
sewage,
meaning
get
the
bacteria
out,
the
deadly
bacteria
out
from
the
sewage?
and
the
man
that
have
presented
the
department
of
natural
resources
said,
six
million
dollars.
where
one
all
the
conferees
said,
“my
god!
six
million
dollars
and
you
don’t
do
anything
about
it.
and
mr.
stein,
who
was
in
charged
of
the
conference
said,
“yes,
and
who
has
to
be
spending
it?”
that
is
the
point
mr.
fenger
(ph).
if
the
people
in
the
area
feel
perfectly
comfortable
paying
$30.00
a
month
for
an
electric
bill
and
$20.00
a
month
for
a
telephone
bill
and
get
excited
when
they
have
to
pay
five
or
six
dollars
for
a
water
bill
and
treat
their
effluent.
we
are
going
to
still
being
troubled
and
this
is
a
basic
problem.
and
this
is
my
--
your
honor
on
the
situation
here,
first
of
all,
let
me
say,
and
only
and
i
don’t
obviously
attempt
to
round
the
affairs
here
over
the
state
of
wisconsin.
but
illinois
just
bought
it.
$750
million
for
the
cleaning
up
of
everything
for
--
while
trying
to
get
air
and
water
pollution
cleaned
up.
$750
million
--
it
seems
to
me
that
six
million
dollars
is
not
too
high
a
price
in
this
instance.
mr.
fred
f.
herzog
milwaukee
alone
--
milwaukee
area
to
clean
it
up.
and
i
might
say
here
in
this
instance,
unlike
the
ohio
case,
where
there
were
other
remedies
available,
where
the
state
of
michigan
had
filed
--
without
avoiding
michigan,
the
suit
had
been
pending
and
the
court
decree
was
issued.
here
i
might
emphasize
again
there
is
no
other
possibility
and
the
damage,
we
cannot
wait
frankly
until
1977.
i
cannot
say
how
they
will
raise
the
money
but
they
haven’t
done
anything
for
five
years.
and
if
they
do
it,
they
have
it
in
the
drawing
states
and
we
cannot
simply
wait
in
this
instance.
the
public
health
cannot
win.
mr.
fred
f.
herzog
no,
this
is
the
only
the
conference
proceedings.
mr.
fred
f.
herzog
yes,
we
have
asked
for
it
and
mr.
justice
douglas
i
might
state
here
what
--
mr.
fred
f.
herzog
well,
i
might
say
that
the
most
direct
example
is
a
(inaudible)
conference
which
was
called
in
august
22,
1957
and
i
don’t
have
to
inform
this
court
which
is
much
more
expertise
in
this
instance
what
does
happened
in
this
instance.
this
conference
hasn’t
left
anything
and
we
are
in
badly
need
of
help.
mr.
fred
f.
herzog
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
motion
by
the
state
of
illinois
asking
this
court
for
a
leave
to
file
a
bill
of
complaint
against
various
wisconsin
municipalities
including
and
foremost
the
city
of
milwaukee
which
as
you
know
quite
well
contains
within
its
boundaries,
the
greatest
concentration
of
people
and
industry
in
the
state
of
wisconsin.
now,
the
bill
of
complaint
is
quite
simple.
it
merely
charges
that
huge
amounts
of
raw
sewage
and
inadequately
treated
sewage
are
dumped
everyday
into
the
waters
of
lake
michigan
that
these
waters
thereby
become
contaminated
and
that
these
polluted
waters
find
their
way
into
the
illinois
territory
where
this
severely
and
i
mean
severely
endanger
the
life
and
health
of
many
residents
of
the
state
of
illinois.
actually,
in
this
particular
instance,
the
department
of
natural
resources
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
which
is
the
agency
which
deals
with
water
pollution
matters
in
the
state
of
wisconsin
has
estimated
that
200
million
gallons
a
day,
200
million
gallons
a
day
in
the
milwaukee
area
alone
are
discharged
into
the
waters
of
lake
michigan.
now,
this
is
not
a
small
matter.
and
it
is
not
a
small
matter
as
we
in
illinois
are
concerned
therewith.
we
in
illinois,
i
must
put
here
the
matter
straight
in
this
instance
have
actually
done
everything
possible
to
wipe
out
pollution.
of
course,
there
are
some
spots
which
are
remaining
but
it
was
through
efforts
of
our
attorney
general
who
is
sitting
next
to
me
here
that
we
have
accomplished
that.
and
i
might
say
here
in
this
instance
that
we
cannot
tolerate
and
suffer
that
such
an
epidemic,
a
possible
epidemic
lurks
behind
every
way
which
really
finds
its
way
into
the
illinois
region.
we
are
familiar,
unfortunately,
in
illinois
with
such
an
epidemic.
in
18
--
the
1880’s,
the
city
of
chicago
dumped
raw
sewage
into
lake
michigan.
the
consequence
was
one
of
the
severest
typhoid
epidemics
which
ever
hit
the
city
of
chicago
--
having
shrink
the
population
of
chicago
and
it
was
at
that
time
that
the
chicago
sanitary
district
was
created
where
the
flow
of
the
rivers
as
you
might
know
is
reversed
and
for
a
--
nothing
goes
into
lake
michigan
on
this
instance.
we
have
--
we
are
actually
here
in
this
particular
instance,
we
have
really
a
situation
where
sovereign
interest
clash
with
each
other.
although
the
suit
is
filed
by
us
performer
against
various
wisconsin
municipalities,
in
reality
--
in
political
reality
and
in
effect
it
is
directed
against
the
state
of
wisconsin.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
respondents
all
in
their
briefs
say
and
emphasize
that
they
are
controlled
by
the
department
of
natural
resources
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
which
are
just
indicate
that
this
--
the
agency
which
is
in
charge
of
water
pollution
matters
particularly
those
concerned
in
lake
michigan.
therefore,
we
have
here,
as
i
indicate
it
a
clash
of
such
sovereign
interests,
the
municipalities
and
state
agencies
merely
being
the
bearers
of
the
sovereign
police
power
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
in
the
field
of
public
health.
under
these
circumstances,
i
respectfully
suggest
that
if
you
have
such
a
clash
of
sovereign
interest,
the
exercise
of
original
jurisdiction
approaches
the
constitutional
mandate
--
i
might
even
say
it
becomes
mandatory
here
in
this
instance.
we
have
an
example
here
too,
in
the
case
of
missouri
versus
illinois,
although
the
illinois
they
have
--
the
state
of
illinois
was
made
to
perform
party.
the
real
culprit
if
i
may
say
so
was
the
chicago
sanitary
district
against
which
the
complaint
was
levied
by
the
state
of
missouri
and
there
reached
--
original
jurisdiction
was
exercised.
mr.
fred
f.
herzog
yes,
they
handle
it
presently
different.
first
of
all,
as
far
as
we
made
this
concern,
it
belongs
to
the
matter
to
the
area
of
the
chicago
metropolitan
sanitary
district.
hence,
their
extensive
treatment
is
provided
and
it
doesn’t
go
into
lake
michigan
but
as
far
as
waukegan
is
concerned
and
to
the
communities
in
the
north
shore
sanitary
district,
they
are
presently
under
orders
of
our
pollution
control
board,
the
foul
water
control
--
pollution
control
board
not
to
emit
any
sewage
into
lake
michigan.
so,
they
do
handle
it
differently.
as
i
said,
due
to
our
efforts
and
the
persistent
efforts
which
we
have
made
in
this
field.
now,
being
here,
a
clash
of
inter-controversy
involving
sovereign
interest,
i
have
indicated
that
really
original
jurisdiction
is
almost
mandatory
in
this
instance.
however,
even
if
they
alleviate
form
or
the
substance
in
this
instance
and
say,
“well,
the
complaint
is
really
not
directed
officially
against
the
state
of
wisconsin.”
nevertheless,
i
can
only
reemphasize
again
that
these
state
agencies
and
these
municipal
corporations
and
i
might
say
that
one
of
the
agency
is
actually
a
state
agency
namely
the
milwaukee
--the
sewerage
commission
of
the
county
of
milwaukee
where
they
may
emphasize
appointed
by
the
governor
of
the
state
of
wisconsin.
but
as
i
said,
even
if
he
looked
at
these
municipalities,
nevertheless,
they
are
the
bearers
of
sovereign
interest.
they
carry
out
within
their
territory
the
police
power
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
in
the
field
of
public
health.
the
question
has
been
asked
by
this
court,
“if
the
court
exercises
jurisdiction,
what
law
would
apply?”
well,
we
submit
here
that
federal
common
law
must
apply
in
such
an
instance.
it
must
apply
because
the
mere
idea
of
sovereignty
demands
the
application
of
such
a
law.
it
cannot
be
a
state
law
although
maybe
the
federal
court
here
can
freely
draw
from
state
resources
of
law.
about
the
law
which
is
applied
is
federal
law
--
a
federal
law
which
has
to
take
into
consideration
the
equality
of
the
sovereigns
which
are
involved
and
has
to
take
into
consideration
the
backdrop
of
various
federal
laws
which
will
come
into
play.
mr.
fred
f.
herzog
a
congress
is
free
and
about
to
--
i’m
sorry
to
say
that
the
entire
bill
both
laid
on
congressional
report
here,
in
this
instance,
that
congress
has
actually
delegated
the
power
here
to
the
various
states.
as
far
as
what
the
quality
standards
are
concerned.
thankfully,
in
my
humble
opinion,
this
is
a
drawback
in
this
instance.
that
it
is
left
to
the
individual
states
to
control
even
water
pollution
and
to
control
it
where
actually
in
these
interstate
disputes,
there
are
sovereign
interests
clash
with
each
other.
mr.
fred
f.
herzog
no,
mr.
justice
white,
i
really
believe
here
in
this
instance
that
under
the
constitutional
mandate
of
article
3
where
the
court
must
really
hear
controversies
which
are
in
effect
between
states,
this
court
must
fashion
its
own
law
and
cannot
--
mr.
fred
f.
herzog
irregardless
here
in
this
instance
of
congress
an
overwriting
law
of
congress
which
says
that
in
this
instance,
federal
--
certain
federal
principles
must
be
applied
which
hasn’t
been
the
case
here.
mr.
fred
f.
herzog
well,
i
--
indeed
in
this
instance,
frankly
i
question
where
the
congress
can
tell
this
court
what
law
to
apply
in
cases
of
original
jurisdiction
to
be
decided
on
the
article
three
of
the
constitution.
mr.
fred
f.
herzog
no.
it
hasn’t
clearly
acted
in
this
matter.
it
hasn’t
clearly
as
far
as
the
federal
law
is
concerned.
it
is
left
to
the
individual
states
really
the
resolution
of
the
problems.
and
it
provided
eventually
if
a
state
asks
for
an
interstate
enforcement
conference
and
there
it
wasn’t
said
what
law
should
be
applied
here,
or
what
rule
should
be
applied
in
this
instance.
so,
it
was
all
left
up
hanging
in
the
air
and
thankfully,
this
is
a
whole
drawback
of
these
interstate
enforcement
conferences.
they
haven’t
worked
and
i
will
indicate
why
they
haven’t
work.
but
be
that
does
it
may,
we
respectfully
submit
here
that
this
is
a
complete
--
this
is
really
the
controversy
between
sovereigns
as
i
have
repeatedly
mentioned
that
the
controversy
here
in
this
instance
which
really
pertains
to
the
use
of
water.
and
if
we
have
such
a
controversy
pertaining
to
the
use
of
water,
mr.
justice
brandeis
here
speaking
for
this
court
in
the
hinderlider
case
which
we
have
quoted
in
our
brief
said
the
following:
“for
whether
the
water
of
an
interstate
stream
must
be
apportioned
between
the
two
states
as
accretion
of
federal
common
law
upon
which
neither
the
statutes
nor
the
decisions
of
either
state
can
be
conclusive.
now
--
mr.
fred
f.
herzog
correct,
your
honor.
but
to
that,
there
is
another
point
here.
it
refers
here
characteristically
his
authority
to
this
case
of
new
jersey
versus
new
york
in
which
actually
that
--
it
was
really
new
york
city
in
which
actually
new
york
city
dumped
its
garbage
into
the
ocean
and
there
the
garbage
was
deposited
if
there
was
an
ill
wind
on
the
shores
of
the
state
of
new
jersey
and
there
were
federal
laws
in
existence.
they
were
--
walked
on
the
harbors
act
of
1899
was
at
this
time
in
existence.
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
was
in
existence
and
actually
the
harbor
mess
of
new
york
at
that
time
gave
to
the
city
of
new
york
the
expressed
permission
to
dumped
in
that
places
where
they
dumped.
nevertheless
here,
this
court
took
a
jurisdiction
and
this
court
decided
here
in
this
particular
instance
that
the
action
was
improper.
i
might
say
here
that
much
is
made
by
the
defendants
of
the
fact
here.
that
there
is
that
federal
water
quality
act
of
1965
or
the
federal
water
pollution
control
act
which
provides
for
an
enforcement
conference
and
the
--
a
remedy
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
if
requested
by
the
administrator
originally
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
now
by
the
administrator
of
the
environmental
protection
agency.
first
of
all,
let
me
emphasize
that
this
remedy
is
not
the
remedy
which
is
even
to
the
state.
it
is
a
remedy
which
is
solely
in
the
discretion
of
the
federal
government.
and
during
22
years,
there
was
one
single
case
where
the
attorney
general
actually
utilized
that
remedy,
apparently,
wasn’t
asked
here
either
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
or
by
the
administrator
of
the
environmental
agency.
and
what
did
this
administrator
say
about
the
effectiveness
of
that
remedy
which
is
supposedly
and
allegedly
provided
here
in
the
federal
law.
this
simply
state
that
you
didn’t
--
it
didn’t
work
at
all.
we
have
pointed
it
out
in
our
brief.
i
want
to
quote
in
a
letter
to
representative
albert,
the
speaker
of
the
house,
he
said,
“these
major
score
of
pollution
control
of
interstate
waters
have
not
proved
sufficiently
strong
and
and
affect
people.”
now,
we
are
not
really
the
persons
who
say
that
these
remedies
have
not
proven
effective,
it
was
the
u.s.
senate,
who
so
held
on
november
2,
1971,
that
the
barely
three
months
ago.
there
on
november
2,
when
they
passed
unanimously
86
to
nothing,
the
new
act,
the
house
hasn’t
take
to
ban
it.
they
are
the
committee
on
public
works
after
two
years
of
study
of
the
federal
water
pollution
control,
go
over
them
and
i’m
quoting,
“concludes
that
the
national
effort
to
abate
and
control
water
pollution
is
inadequate
in
every
vital
aspect.
rivers,
lakes
and
streams
are
being
used
to
dispose
of
man’s
waste
rather
than
to
support
man’s
life
and
health.
and
the
use
of
any
river,
lakes,
stream
or
ocean
as
a
waste
treatment
system
is
unacceptable.
and
they
said
this
was
due
to
the
time
schedules
for
abatement
are
slipping
away,
because
of
failure
to
enforce
lack
of
effluent
controls
and
disputes
over
federal
state
standards.”
this
is
a
work,
i
might
say
of
senator
muskie
who
reported
here
this
bill
in
behalf
of
the
committee
on
public
works.
now,
what
are
the
effects
hereof
the
michigan
and
state
enforcement
conference?
it
was
the
state
of
illinois
as
the
only
state
which
in
1967
asked
for
that
convening
of
that
conference
because
we
were
eventually
afraid
of
these
wastes
which
come
every
day
into
the
state
of
illinois.
we
were
afraid
because
all
our
efforts
would
be
set
to
not
and
would
be
futile
if
we
couldn’t
act
here
in
this
instance
against
the
neighboring
states.
and
therefore,
we
asked
for
the
convening
of
the
conference.
this
is
unlike,
i
might
say,
ohio
versus
wyandotte
where
there
was
at
lake
erie
conference
which
was
in
existence
only
for
one
year
before
the
suit
was
filed.
in
1968,
the
first
conference
met.
there
were
high
sounding
declarations
of
that
--
the
state
should
cooperate
in
the
pollution
control
abatement
programs,
deadlines
were
set,
operations
schedules
provided.
but
what
came
of
it?
in
1969,
the
second
conference
met.
and
again
there
were
broken
deadlines.
some
of
the
municipalities
didn’t
even
start.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
one
of
the
municipalities
here
involved
has
a
1967
deadline
to
the
goal
to
enlarge
their
sewage
treatment
facilities,
it
has
still
not
complied
with
these
schedules.
in
1970,
the
third
conference
met
and
it
meant
significantly
in
the
city
of
milwaukee
because
the
chairman
of
the
conference
who
is
a
federal
official
turns
to
the
representative
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
and
i’m
quoting
what
he
said,
“but
the
point
is
that
the
biggest
city
in
us
state,
milwaukee
wounded
discharges
into
lake
michigan.
the
water
that
we
have
a
real
high
priority
to
protect
is
in
clear
violation
of
this
conference
recommendation.
they
are
more
than
two
years
late
on
disinfection
of
the
effluent
and
the
lack
of
putting
out
this
disinfection
means
that
pathogens
go
into
the
lake.
now,
these
are
the
bold
facts
as
i
see
them.
the
largest
city
in
this
state
is
not
disinfecting
its
effluent.
well,
then
be
learned
this
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
fred
f.
herzog
no,
we
have
no
such
remedy.
we
can’t
go
to
the
federal
conference,
we
can’t
eventually
ask
for
a
hearing
board
but
then
after
the
hearing
and
by
the
way,
i
might
say
that
contrary
to
what
the
state
and
in
the
respondents’
brief,
we
would
not
have
a
remedy
under
the
administrative
review
act
because
under
the
administrative
review
act,
such
remedy
would
not
be
in
existence
if
a
decision
is
made
by
a
representative
body.
i
think
it
is
section
7
of
the
administrative
review
board.
they
would
not
have
a
remedy.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
have
no
remedy
under
the
state
law
unlike
ohio
versus
wyandotte.
we
could
not
go
into
the
state
of
illinois.
yes,
we
could
sue
them
under
a
long-armed
statute.
how
are
we
going
to
enforce
particularly
in
an
injunctive
decree
against
milwaukee,
against
the
sovereign
agencies
of
another
state?
yes,
they
recognize.
it’s
the
same
is
to
--
with
the
federal
court,
we
do
not
qualify
as
a
citizen
under
the
diversity
proceedings
which
is
recognized
also
by
this
court
in
the
wyandotte
case.
we
could
not.
yes,
we
could
go
as
suggested
and
i
can
only
take
this
suggestion
almost
that
procedures
that
we
should
go
to
the
department
of
natural
resources
of
wisconsin
and
ask
for
a
relief.
this
is
if
you
would
say
here,
the
sheep
should
go
to
the
wolf
and
ask
here
to
meet
our
justice
amongst
them.
this
is
the
very
person,
these
are
the
various
agencies
which
tolerate
that
condition
here
and
what
did
about
--
by
the
way
as
far
as
the
enforcement
conference
is
concerned,
what
did
wisconsin
save
in
the
conference
may
emphasize,
but
you
have
changed
these
deadlines
unilaterally.
they
said,
“well,
it’s
true,
we
did
so
but
we
consulted
the
federal
water
quality
administration
and
then
they
say
here,
and
this
is
characteristic,
this
is
a
quotation
from
their
report
to
the
conference,
“it
should
be
further
noted
that
there
are
no
published
rules
or
regulations
or
guidelines
that
have
been
promulgated
by
the
department
of
the
interior
to
give
specific
guidelines
and
details
on
how
this
whole
area
of
joint
enforcement
of
standards
and
recommendations
should
be
administered.
we
consider
the
lack
of
such
rule
to
be
a
substantial
weakness
in
conference
procedures.”
that’s
their
own
words!
they
really
denigrate
here
the
whole
procedure
as
such
and
nothing
is
left.
if
it
please
this
court
here,
this
is
not
the
question
as
i
have
said
of
property,
this
is
a
question
literally
and
this
is
not
high-sounding
oratory.
this
is
a
question
of
human
lives
which
are
involved.
we
might
be
saying,
we
are
equally
concern
or
the
lives
of
the
citizens
of
wisconsin
but
we
have
noted
about
these
humane
concern
for
the
wisconsin
residents
cannot
be
translated
by
us
into
redirection
but
it
can
be
translated
by
us
into
redirection
as
far
as
residents
of
the
state
of
illinois
are
concerned.
and
we
are
under
a
duty
under
federal
water
quality
act,
places
a
responsibility
for
action
foremost
in
the
states.
this
is
a
constant
theme
of
the
federal
water
quality
act
in
the
policy
statement
and
even
in
the
statement
where
--
which
deals
with
the
enforcement
provisions,
which
deals
with
the
conference.
there
it
says,
“state
actions
shall
not
be
displaced
by
an
action
of
the
federal
government
unless
the
court
do
what
they
have
been
issued
and
of
course,
never
been
issued.
so,
under
these
circumstances,
where
there
is
no
other
remedy
available
to
us,
at
least
no
other
reasonable
remedy
and
where
we
surely
are
not
going
to
subject
our
sovereign
interest
to
an
administrative
agency
of
the
state
of
wisconsin.
and
where
sovereign
interest
clash,
i
must
respectfully
submit
that
the
exercise
of
original
jurisdiction
is
the
only
thing
which
is
left.
everyday
which
goes
by
cause
to
see
irreparable
harm
and
to
postpone
the
deadlines
simply
would
not
do
anymore.
we
have
waited
three
years,
four
years,
now
five
years
and
by
the
way
the
situation
still
hasn’t
been
corrected.
in
the
latest
brief
of
the
milwaukee
sewerage
commission
on
page
six,
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
they
talked
of
one
of
their
treatment
plants,
let’s
say
primary
treatment
is
operative
of
the
other.
you
know
what
this
means
in
the
parlance
of
the
health
authorities.
primary
treatments
means
that
the
solids
merely
are
taken
out
which
is
nothing
--absolutely
nothing
--
as
far
as
health
is
concerned.
secondary
treatment
is
demanded
when
at
least
90%
--
85%
or
90%
of
the
solids
are
removed
and
nowadays,
we
have
recognized
that
even
secondary
treatment
in
many
instances
is
not
sufficient.
i
respectfully
urge
this
court
here
to
exercise
jurisdiction.
unlike
wyandotte
versus
ohio,
this
is
not
where
a
private
individuals
are
involved.
this
is
a
suit
between
sovereigns
and
unlike
wyandotte,
no
other
remedy
at
least
attach
it
to
remedy
is
available
to
the
state
of
illinois
which
will
prevent
the
irreparable
harm.
mr.
fred
f.
herzog
just
a
minute.
mr.
fred
f.
herzog
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
about
these
huge
expenditures
of
money,
let
me
quote
only
here
one
instance
from
the
conference,
the
third
conference
which
took
place
in
1970.
there
the
question
arose
how
much
it
would
cost
to
disinfect
the
sewage,
meaning
get
the
bacteria
out,
the
deadly
bacteria
out
from
the
sewage?
and
the
man
that
have
presented
the
department
of
natural
resources
said,
six
million
dollars.
where
one
all
the
conferees
said,
“my
god!
six
million
dollars
and
you
don’t
do
anything
about
it.
and
mr.
stein,
who
was
in
charged
of
the
conference
said,
“yes,
and
who
has
to
be
spending
it?”
that
is
the
point
mr.
fenger
(ph).
if
the
people
in
the
area
feel
perfectly
comfortable
paying
$30.00
a
month
for
an
electric
bill
and
$20.00
a
month
for
a
telephone
bill
and
get
excited
when
they
have
to
pay
five
or
six
dollars
for
a
water
bill
and
treat
their
effluent.
we
are
going
to
still
being
troubled
and
this
is
a
basic
problem.
and
this
is
my
--
your
honor
on
the
situation
here,
first
of
all,
let
me
say,
and
only
and
i
don’t
obviously
attempt
to
round
the
affairs
here
over
the
state
of
wisconsin.
but
illinois
just
bought
it.
$750
million
for
the
cleaning
up
of
everything
for
--
while
trying
to
get
air
and
water
pollution
cleaned
up.
$750
million
--
it
seems
to
me
that
six
million
dollars
is
not
too
high
a
price
in
this
instance.
mr.
fred
f.
herzog
milwaukee
alone
--
milwaukee
area
to
clean
it
up.
and
i
might
say
here
in
this
instance,
unlike
the
ohio
case,
where
there
were
other
remedies
available,
where
the
state
of
michigan
had
filed
--
without
avoiding
michigan,
the
suit
had
been
pending
and
the
court
decree
was
issued.
here
i
might
emphasize
again
there
is
no
other
possibility
and
the
damage,
we
cannot
wait
frankly
until
1977.
i
cannot
say
how
they
will
raise
the
money
but
they
haven’t
done
anything
for
five
years.
and
if
they
do
it,
they
have
it
in
the
drawing
states
and
we
cannot
simply
wait
in
this
instance.
the
public
health
cannot
win.
mr.
fred
f.
herzog
no,
this
is
the
only
the
conference
proceedings.
mr.
fred
f.
herzog
yes,
we
have
asked
for
it
and
mr.
justice
douglas
i
might
state
here
what
--
mr.
fred
f.
herzog
well,
i
might
say
that
the
most
direct
example
is
a
(inaudible)
conference
which
was
called
in
august
22,
1957
and
i
don’t
have
to
inform
this
court
which
is
much
more
expertise
in
this
instance
what
does
happened
in
this
instance.
this
conference
hasn’t
left
anything
and
we
are
in
badly
need
of
help.
