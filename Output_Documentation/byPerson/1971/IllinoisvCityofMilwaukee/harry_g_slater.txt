mr.
harry
g.
slater
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
i
do
not
propose
to
get
into
any
controversy
with
the
state
of
illinois
and
the
factual
demonstration.
we
may
differ
structurally
but
i
do
not
think
this
is
the
form
where
that
should
be
presented.
this
matter
i
think
is
also
been
somewhat
exaggerated
in
the
presentation
that
has
been
made.
and
we
ought
to
very
briefly
look
at
the
background
here
to
ascertain
just
what
the
situation
is.
i
should
like
to
also
say
in
defense
of
my
city,
we
are
a
progressive,
we
are
a
good
city
and
we
respect
the
rights
of
our
citizens
and
the
rights
of
other
citizens
and
we
do
is
absolutely
at
our
disposal
to
make
that
situation
obtained.
mr.
harry
g.
slater
the
only
deadline
that
i’m
aware
of
mr.
chief
justice
is
the
deadline
that
was
promulgated
by
the
state
department
of
natural
resources.
i
believe
that
was
promulgated
in
1970
and
they
reviewed
this
situation
in
an
impartial,
not
controversial
partisan
manner
and
determined
that
the
city
of
milwaukee
shall
have
until
1977
to
make
these
broad
and
overwhelming
changes
in
the
sewer
system
and
in
the
manner
of
handling
sewage.
and
i
should
like
to
state
here
that
the
state
department
of
natural
resources
is
created
under
wisconsin
statutes.
it
is
a
quasi-judicial
body.
it
is
impartial.
it
has
the
same
respect
for
illinois
as
it
does
for
wisconsin.
and
this
body
had
promulgated
orders
after
making
findings
and
has
said
what
i’ve
just
stated
mainly
that
we
shall
have
until
1977
to
make
these
effective
changes.
mr.
harry
g.
slater
mr.
chief
justice,
i
know
of
none.
i
do
not
even
know
that
illinois
complained
against
that
deadline.
and
i
should
also
like
to
state
that
this
conference
came
about
in
1967,
the
governor
--
the
then
governor
of
illinois
asked
for
this
conference
from
the
united
states
secretary
of
interior
and
this
conference
was
called
and
you
have
four
participating
states.
you
had
michigan,
indiana,
illinois
and
wisconsin.
and
they
all
came
under
cooperative
basis
to
effectuate
a
remedy
for
this
important
problem.
now,
this
problem
didn’t
come
overnight.
it
came
over
a
long
period
of
years
and
by
the
same
token,
it
cannot
be
solved
overnight
even
though
every
municipality,
every
state,
and
every
individual
would
like
to
solve
the
problem
of
pollution
in
a
quick,
and
easy
and
effective
manner.
mr.
harry
g.
slater
the
conference
was
first
asked
for,
mr.
justice,
in
1967.
it
was
convened
in
1968.
in
january
1968,
it
went
after
a
couple
of
months
and
as
a
result
of
that,
the
state
department
of
natural
resources
and
i
don’t
think
it
is
fair
to
make
this
an
agent
of
the
city
of
milwaukee.
it
is
an
administrative
agency
of
the
state
of
wisconsin.
mr.
harry
g.
slater
that
is
correct.
mr.
harry
g.
slater
let
me
explain
mr.
chief
justice
why
that
is
required.
i
think
it
also
demonstrates
very
effectively
that
the
great
pressing
circumstances
which
have
been
dramatically
displayed
here
today
are
not
exactly
in
that
sense
but
let
me
get
to
this
point.
what
is
involved
in
this
correction
procedure?
the
direction
of
this
order
of
the
case
is
that
the
city
of
milwaukee
would
have
to
separate
its
combined
sanitary
and
storing
sewerage.
now,
this
as
we
understand
from
our
own
engineering
estimates
and
we
think
they’re
fair
would
take
overall
approximately
a
half
of
billion
dollars.
$300
million
would
have
to
come
from
local
taxation;
$200
million
would
have
to
come
from
property
owners
who
would
have
to
make
the
necessary
and
essential
improvements
that
compliment
that
which
the
city
of
milwaukee
does.
now,
it
does
not
take
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
that
no
municipality
today
or
perhaps
in
the
immediate
future
is
going
to
be
in
the
position
to
formulate
a
financial
program
that
is
going
to
permit
these
overwhelming
expenditures.
we’re
doing
our
job.
we’re
trying
to
meet
the
situation.
but
how
do
you
waive
$300
million
to
local
taxations
when
you
are
already
burdened
with
the
day-to-day
operations
of
your
own
municipal
government
and
with
the
social
programs
essential
to
vary
--
to
a
number
of
people
in
order
to
carry
on
your
municipal
operations.
so,
when
you
look
at
that
situation
and
recognize
that
that
type
of
money
and
the
burden
of
doing
the
mechanical
work
itself
and
the
necessary
manpower
which
will
accomplish
it
is
so
great;
i
must
respectfully
suggest
mr.
chief
--mr.
justice
that
1977
does
not
appear
to
be
unreasonable.
now
--
mr.
harry
g.
slater
what
is
that?
mr.
harry
g.
slater
yes,
that
is
true.
what
is
now
being
done
and
there’s
been
some
concept
of
--
(voice
overlap).
mr.
harry
g.
slater
the
preparations
are
going
forward.
i
must
confess
that
the
problem
of
money
is
so
great
that
we
cannot
have
just
a
practical
answer
to
that
question.
i
wish
mr.
justice
we
did.
mr.
harry
g.
slater
nothing
from
a
financial
point
of
view
except
that
day-to-day
--
mr.
harry
g.
slater
i
would
have
to
confess
that
we
have
not
done
much
more
than
the
day-to-day
sewer
construction
which
already
constitutes
a
financial
burden.
now,
let
me
also
point
out
this.
there
are
other
practical
considerations.
assume
you
have
a
special
master
appointed.
we’re
not
determining
whether
or
not
there
should
be
collection.
i
think
that’s
already
been
determined
by
the
orders
of
the
department
of
natural
resources.
what
is
this
special
master
going
to
address
himself
to?
he
is
going
to
have
to
address
himself
to
the
very
problems
that
we’re
talking
about
because
in
order
to
make
an
--
we
would
want
to
comply
with
an
order.
but
how
does
a
city
of
the
size
of
milwaukee
with
a
substantial
debt
already
and
with
a
maximum
debt
fixed
by
the
constitution
go
out
and
raise
this
kind
of
money?
what
we
have
to
do
is
look
to
the
federal
government
for
assistance,
for
cooperation,
and
for
grants.
now,
short
of
that,
i
don’t
know
where
a
special
master
would
be
able
to
accomplish
anymore,
if
this
was
a
case
to
determine
what
are
the
degree
of
pollution,
what
is
the
city’s
reaction
to
it.
perhaps
the
special
master
could
play
a
role.
but
let
me
say
this,
the
department
of
natural
resources
have
issued
these
orders.
we
have
not
appealed
for
them.
these
are
your
stand.
there’s
been
no
delay.
if
we
were
looking
for
a
delay,
we
could
have
had
reviews
of
these
orders
but
they
have
not
been
submitted
on
that
basis.
they’ve
been
accepted
by
the
city
of
milwaukee
in
good
faith
and
we
do
propose
to
act
on
it.
mr.
harry
g.
slater
i
would
not
suggest
that
that
is
the
situation.
we
do
have
--
mr.
harry
g.
slater
well,
mr.
justice,
we
do
what
i
think
is
a
good
constructive
job.
we’re
not
getting
all
of
it,
i
must
confess.
and
the
problem
is
with
that
access,
but
i
do
not
want
to
demean
our
own
efforts.
we
have
an
excellent
sewerage
commission
that
does
a
marvelous
job.
mr.
harry
g.
slater
yes,
i
would
recommend
first
this,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
harry
g.
slater
if
the
court
please,
i
think
this
is
somewhat
different.
you
have
to
bear
in
mind
--
mr.
harry
g.
slater
well,
i
understand
that,
i
have
been
on
the
other
side
of
this
question
in
water
diversion.
so,
i
realize
that
there
may
be
different
sides
but
in
this
case,
i
do
not
think
that
that
is
true.
i
think
there’s
one
side
and
i’m
trying
to
explain
to
the
court
just
what
it
is.
and
that
side
is
simply
this,
you
did
have
a
conference.
the
congress
has
set
up
the
machinery
for
this
conference.
it
was
held
in
good
faith.
now,
if
the
department
of
natural
resources
after
this
conference
and
after
all
of
the
reviews
had
done
nothing,
i
would
say,
“i
would
have
reason
to
complain.”
but
if
the
department
of
natural
resources
has
already
demonstrated
some
partiality
and
it’s
good
faith,
how,
by
issuing
the
very
orders
that
had
been
issued
against
the
city
of
milwaukee,
against
racine,
against
kenosha
and
against
others.
mr.
harry
g.
slater
i
have
not.
i
am
concerned
about
our
own.
i
think
that
we
accomplished
something.
mr.
harry
g.
slater
i
do
not
believe
so
for
this
reason,
mr.
justice.
the
state
department
of
natural
resources
can
impose
very
fines
against
any
violations.
mr.
harry
g.
slater
i
said
--
i
must
confess
i
did
not
participate.
i
don’t
know
how
they
were
run.
i
do
know
the
results
of
the
conference
was
the
promulgation
of
orders
that
i’ve
already
alluded
to.
and
this
is
all
that
i
can
say
about
them
because
we
are
not
the
state
of
wisconsin
and
i
say
this
because
illinois
have
argued
that
this
is
a
contest
between
the
state
of
illinois
and
the
state
of
wisconsin.
they’ve
done
this
and
trying
to
get
this
case
away
from
the
very
excellent
constructive
rule
that
was
applied
on
the
wyandotte
chemicals
case.
but
that’s
not
the
fact.
now,
why
doesn’t
illinois
bring
wisconsin
--
and
the
state
of
wisconsin
in
speaking
up?
and
this
is
my
own
observation.
they
did
not
bring
them
in
because
they
found
that
the
state
of
wisconsin
was
cooperating
very
beautifully
with
illinois.
they
were
issued
--
they
had
this
conference.
they
did
issue
these
orders.
these
orders
are
part
of
to
the
municipality.
now,
what
more
can
wisconsin
do?
wisconsin
is
here
--
mr.
harry
g.
slater
mr.
chief
justice,
i
am
not
permitted
to
speak
for
the
state
of
wisconsin.
i
do
not
have
that
right.
i
would
say
this
that
the
illinois
shows
the
parties
that
they
wanted
to
bring
into
this
action.
they
chose
not
to
bring
--
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
perhaps
for
two
reasons.
i
can
offer
a
second
reason;
they
may
have
felt
that
if
the
state
of
wisconsin
came
in,
there
might
be
some
kind
of
a
thrust
plan
against
some
of
the
municipalities
in
illinois
and
maybe
that
was
one
of
the
reasons.
i
am
purely
conjecturing
on
that
point.
but
i
do
say
that
when
the
argument
is
made
here
that
this
is
against
the
state
of
wisconsin,
it
is
not!
it
is
against
municipal
corporations
and
we’re
just
one
small
step
away
from
a
private
corporation.
and
so,
you
have
exactly
the
same
situation
here
as
you
have
on
the
wyandotte
chemical
case.
i
see
no
distinction
and
what
was
true
in
the
wyandotte
chemical
case
is
equally
true
here.
there
is
no
difference.
mr.
harry
g.
slater
well,
that
is
correct.
the
state
of
wisconsin
was
not
--
the
state
of
wisconsin
was
issuing
orders
which
was
trying
to
correct
the
situation
but
having
put
wisconsin
all
of
these
litigations
for
the
moment;
does
that
--
this
bring
our
situation
squarely
within
the
wyandotte
chemical
case
which
was
issued
just
about
a
year
ago?
and
there
is
nothing
new
in
this
situation
which
should
emphasize
this
case
as
a
distinction
against
the
decision
that
was
made
in
the
ohio
case.
that
is
our
position
and
we
have
tried
to
present
in
a
straightforward
manner.
we
recognize
that
we
are
--
the
--
we
have
--
had
orders
issued
against
us.
we
do
not
try
to
mitigate
that
situation.
we
recognize
that
there
is
a
problem.
we
are
working
on
meeting
that
problem.
we
have
a
terrific
financial
burden
that
we
have
to
work
out
because
no
city
across
the
nation
today
with
all
the
needs
of
the
city
and
with
the
great
pressing
demand
for
tech
sharing
is
the
position
to
meet
this
kind
if
an
overpowering
burden.
while
that
may
not
be
excused
to
pollution,
there
is
a
practical
situation
that
the
special
master
would
likewise
have
to
deal
with
because
this
will
not
go
away
with
the
waiving
of
the
magic
wand.
the
problem
is
there.
it’s
got
to
be
solved.
we’re
doing
our
best
to
solve
it
mr.
harry
g.
slater
mr.
chief
justice,
are
you
speaking
about
the
state
department
of
natural
resources?
mr.
harry
g.
slater
i
would
think
that
the
state
department
of
natural
resources
felt
that
we
were
not
showing
good
faith
and
the
response
which
they
had
a
reasonable
right
to
anticipate.
they
could
go
into
court
and
deal
with
us
accordingly.
i’m
satisfied
too
that
if
they
felt
that
way,
they
would
not
hesitate
to
do
it
not
withstanding
illinois’
claim
that
this
is
a
totally
partisanship
arrangement.
mr.
harry
g.
slater
i
assume
they
could
say
it
but
i
assume
that
they’re
also
practical
engineers
and
they
know
that
by
saying
it
this
cannot
be
accomplished
if
so.
i
wish
it
could.
this
is
not
the
ordinary
problem.
mr.
harry
g.
slater
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
assume
that
they
could
do
that
under
the
broad
powers
that
they
have
on
the
chapter
144
of
this
wisconsin
statute.
yes,
i
would
have
to
answer
yes.
at
least,
that’s
my
observation.
mr.
harry
g.
slater
that
is
correct.
mr.
justice
because
the
state
department
of
natural
resources
is
not
a
judicial
body,
it
is
a
quasi-judicial
body.
it
is
primarily
administrative
and
would
have
to
act
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
wisconsin.
mr.
harry
g.
slater
that
is
correct
and
may
i
also
add
--
mr.
harry
g.
slater
well,
if
you
have
that
view,
we’d
accept
it.
the
view
that
we
have
mentioned
here
today
was
the
practical
ones.
mr.
harry
g.
slater
well,
that
is
an
equitable
consideration.
i
assume
that
you
are
going
to
court
to
try
to
get
an
injunction
against
us.
this
would
be
within
the
broad
scope
of
the
equitable
powers
of
the
reviewing
tribunal.
so,
that
the
courts
are
there
and
may
add
this,
i
don’t
think
that
illinois
need
have
any
fear.
we
have
very
excellent
trial
courts
and
we
assume
the
same
would
be
true
if
we
had
to
go
into
illinois.
i
see
no
problem
there.
mr.
harry
g.
slater
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
i
do
not
propose
to
get
into
any
controversy
with
the
state
of
illinois
and
the
factual
demonstration.
we
may
differ
structurally
but
i
do
not
think
this
is
the
form
where
that
should
be

this
matter
i
think
is

other
citizens
and
we
do
is
absolutely
at
our

to
make
that
situation
obtained.
mr.
harry
g.
slater
the
only
deadline
that
i’m
aware
of
mr.
chief
justice
is
the
deadline
that
was
promulgated
by
the
state
department
of
natural
resources.
i
believe
that
was
promulgated
in
1970
and
they
reviewed
this
situation
in
an
impartial,
not
controversial
partisan
manner
and
determined
that
the
city
of
milwaukee
shall
have
until
1977
to
make
these
broad
and
overwhelming
changes
in
the
sewer
system
and
in
the
manner
of
handling
sewage.
and
i
should
like
to
state
here
that
the
state
department
of
natural
resources
is
created
under
wisconsin
statutes.
it
is
a
quasi-judicial
body.
it
is
impartial.
it
has
the
same
respect
for
illinois
as
it
does
for
wisconsin.
and
this
body
had
promulgated
orders
after
making
findings
and
has
said
what
i’ve
just
stated
mainly
that
we
shall
have
until
1977
to
make
these
effective
changes.
mr.
harry
g.
slater
mr.
chief
justice,
i
know
of
none.
i
do
not
even
know
that
illinois
complained
against
that
deadline.
and
i
should
also
like
to
state
that
this
conference
came
about
in
1967,
the
governor
--
the
then
governor
of
illinois
asked
for
this
conference
from
the
united
states
secretary
of
interior
and
this
conference
was
called
and
you
have
four
participating
states.
you
had
michigan,
indiana,
illinois
and
wisconsin.
and
they
all
came
under
cooperative
basis
to
effectuate
a
remedy
for
this
important
problem.
now,
this
problem
didn’t
come
overnight.
it
came
over
a
long
period
of
years
and
by
the
same
token,
it
cannot
be
solved
overnight
even
though
every
municipality,
every
state,
and
every
individual
would
like
to
solve
the
problem
of
pollution
in
a
quick,
and
easy
and
effective
manner.
mr.
harry
g.
slater
the
conference
was
first
asked
for,
mr.
justice,
in
1967.
it
was
convened
in
1968.
in
january
1968,
it
went
after
a
couple
of
months
and
as
a
result
of
that,
the
state
department
of
natural
resources
and
i
don’t
think
it
is
fair
to
make
this
an
agent
of
the
city
of
milwaukee.
it
is
an
administrative
agency
of
the
state
of
wisconsin.
mr.
harry
g.
slater
that
is
correct.
mr.
harry
g.
slater
let
me
explain
mr.
chief
justice
why
that
is
required.
i
think
it
also
demonstrates
very
effectively
that
the
great
pressing
circumstances
which
have
been
dramatically
displayed
here
today
are
not
exactly
in
that
sense
but
let
me
get
to
this
point.
what
is
involved
in
this
correction
procedure?
the
direction
of
this
order
of
the
case
is
that
the
city
of
milwaukee
would
have
to
separate
its
combined
sanitary
and
storing
sewerage.
now,
this
as
we
understand
from
our
own
engineering
estimates
and
we
think
they’re
fair
would
take
overall
approximately
a
half
of
billion
dollars.
$300
million
would
have
to
come
from
local
taxation;
$200
million
would
have
to
come
from
property
owners
who
would
have
to
make
the
necessary
and
essential
improvements
that
compliment
that
which
the
city
of
milwaukee
does.
now,
it
does
not
take
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
that
no
municipality
today
or
perhaps
in
the
immediate
future
is
going
to
be
in
the
position
to
formulate
a
financial
program
that
is
going
to
permit
these
overwhelming
expenditures.
we’re
doing
our
job.
we’re
trying
to
meet
the
situation.
but
how
do
you
waive
$300
million
to
local
taxations
when
you
are
already
burdened
with
the
day-to-day
operations
of
your
own
municipal
government
and
with
the
social
programs
essential
to
vary
--
to
a
number
of
people
in
order
to
carry
on
your
municipal
operations.
so,
when
you
look
at
that
situation
and
recognize
that
that
type
of
money
and
the
burden
of
doing
the
mechanical
work
itself
and
the
necessary
manpower
which
will
accomplish
it
is
so
great;
i
must
respectfully
suggest
mr.
chief
--mr.
justice
that
1977
does
not
appear
to
be
unreasonable.
now
--
mr.
harry
g.
slater
what
is
that?
mr.
harry
g.
slater
yes,
that
is
true.
what
is
now
being
done
and
there’s
been
some
concept
of
--
(voice
overlap).
mr.
harry
g.
slater
the
preparations
are
going
forward.
i
must
confess
that
the
problem
of
money
is
so
great
that
we
cannot
have
just
a
practical
answer
to
that
question.
i
wish
mr.
justice
we
did.
mr.
harry
g.
slater
nothing
from
a
financial
point
of
view
except
that
day-to-day
--
mr.
harry
g.
slater
i
would
have
to
confess
that
we
have
not
done
much
more
than
the
day-to-day
sewer
construction
which
already
constitutes
a
financial
burden.
now,
let
me
also
point
out
this.
there
are
other
practical
considerations.
assume
you
have
a
special
master
appointed.
we’re
not
determining
whether
or
not
there
should
be
collection.
i
think
that’s
already
been
determined
by
the
orders
of
the
department
of
natural
resources.
what
is
this
special
master
going
to
address
himself
to?
he
is
going
to
have
to
address
himself
to
the
very
problems
that
we’re
talking
about
because
in
order
to
make
an
--
we
would
want
to
comply
with
an
order.
but
how
does
a
city
of
the
size
of
milwaukee
with
a
substantial
debt
already
and
with
a
maximum
debt
fixed
by
the
constitution
go
out
and
raise
this
kind
of
money?
what
we
have
to
do
is
look
to
the
federal
government
for
assistance,
for
cooperation,
and
for
grants.
now,
short
of
that,
i
don’t
know
where
a
special
master
would
be
able
to
accomplish
anymore,
if
this
was
a
case
to
determine
what
are
the
degree
of
pollution,
what
is
the
city’s
reaction
to
it.
perhaps
the
special
master
could
play
a
role.
but
let
me
say
this,
the
department
of
natural
resources
have
issued
these
orders.
we
have
not
appealed
for
them.
these
are
your
stand.
there’s
been
no
delay.
if
we
were
looking
for
a
delay,
we
could
have
had
reviews
of
these
orders
but
they
have
not
been
submitted
on
that
basis.
they’ve
been
accepted
by
the
city
of
milwaukee
in
good
faith
and
we
do
propose
to
act
on
it.
mr.
harry
g.
slater
i
would
not
suggest
that
that
is
the
situation.
we
do
have
--
mr.
harry
g.
slater
well,
mr.
justice,
we
do
what
i
think
is
a
good
constructive
job.
we’re
not
getting
all
of
it,
i
must
confess.
and
the
problem
is
with
that
access,
but
i
do
not
want
to
demean
our
own
efforts.
we
have
an
excellent
sewerage
commission
that
does
a
marvelous
job.
mr.
harry
g.
slater
yes,
i
would
recommend
first
this,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
harry
g.
slater
if
the
court
please,
i
think
this
is
somewhat
different.
you
have
to
bear
in
mind
--
mr.
harry
g.
slater
well,
i
understand
that,
i
have
been
on
the
other
side
of
this
question
in
water
diversion.
so,
i
realize
that
there
may
be
different
sides
but
in
this
case,
i
do
not
think
that
that
is
true.
i
think
there’s
one
side
and
i’m
trying
to
explain
to
the
court
just
what
it
is.
and
that
side
is
simply
this,
you
did
have
a
conference.
the
congress
has
set
up
the
machinery
for
this
conference.
it
was
held
in
good
faith.
now,
if
the
department
of
natural
resources
after
this
conference
and
after
all
of
the
reviews
had
done
nothing,
i
would
say,
“i
would
have
reason
to
complain.”
but
if
the
department
of
natural
resources
has
already
demonstrated
some
partiality
and
it’s
good
faith,
how,
by
issuing
the
very
orders
that
had
been
issued
against
the
city
of
milwaukee,
against
racine,
against
kenosha
and
against
others.
mr.
harry
g.
slater
i
have
not.
i
am
concerned
about
our
own.
i
think
that
we
accomplished
something.
mr.
harry
g.
slater
i
do
not
believe
so
for
this
reason,
mr.
justice.
the
state
department
of
natural
resources
can
impose
very
fines
against
any
violations.
mr.
harry
g.
slater
i
said
--
i
must
confess
i
did
not
participate.
i
don’t
know
how
they
were
run.
i
do
know
the
results
of
the
conference
was
the
promulgation
of
orders
that
i’ve
already
alluded
to.
and
this
is
all
that
i
can
say
about
them
because
we
are
not
the
state
of
wisconsin
and
i
say
this
because
illinois
have
argued
that
this
is
a
contest
between
the
state
of
illinois
and
the
state
of
wisconsin.
they’ve
done
this
and
trying
to
get
this
case
away
from
the
very
excellent
constructive
rule
that
was
applied
on
the
wyandotte
chemicals
case.
but
that’s
not
the
fact.
now,
why
doesn’t
illinois
bring
wisconsin
--
and
the
state
of
wisconsin
in
speaking
up?
and
this
is
my
own
observation.
they
did
not
bring
them
in
because
they
found
that
the
state
of
wisconsin
was
cooperating
very
beautifully
with
illinois.
they
were
issued
--
they
had
this
conference.
they
did
issue
these
orders.
these
orders
are
part
of
to
the
municipality.
now,
what
more
can
wisconsin
do?
wisconsin
is
here
--
mr.
harry
g.
slater
mr.
chief
justice,
i
am
not
permitted
to
speak
for
the
state
of
wisconsin.
i
do
not
have
that
right.
i
would
say
this
that
the
illinois
shows
the
parties
that
they
wanted
to
bring
into
this
action.
they
chose
not
to
bring
--
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
perhaps
for
two
reasons.
i
can
offer
a
second
reason;
they
may
have
felt
that
if
the
state
of
wisconsin
came
in,
there
might
be
some
kind
of
a
thrust
plan
against
some
of
the
municipalities
in
illinois
and
maybe
that
was
one
of
the
reasons.
i
am
purely
conjecturing
on
that
point.
but
i
do
say
that
when
the
argument
is
made
here
that
this
is
against
the
state
of
wisconsin,
it
is
not!
it
is
against
municipal
corporations
and
we’re
just
one
small
step
away
from
a
private
corporation.
and
so,
you
have
exactly
the
same
situation
here
as
you
have
on
the
wyandotte
chemical
case.
i
see
no
distinction
and
what
was
true
in
the
wyandotte
chemical
case
is
equally
true
here.
there
is
no
difference.
mr.
harry
g.
slater
well,
that
is
correct.
the
state
of
wisconsin
was
not
--
the
state
of
wisconsin
was
issuing
orders
which
was
trying
to
correct
the
situation
but
having
put
wisconsin
all
of
these
litigations
for
the
moment;
does
that
--
this
bring
our
situation
squarely
within
the
wyandotte
chemical
case
which
was
issued
just
about
a
year
ago?
and
there
is
nothing
new
in
this
situation
which
should
emphasize
this
case
as
a
distinction
against
the
decision
that
was
made
in
the
ohio
case.
that
is
our
position
and
we
have
tried
to
present
in
a
straightforward
manner.
we
recognize
that
we
are
--
the
--
we
have
--
had
orders
issued
against
us.
we
do
not
try
to
mitigate
that
situation.
we
recognize
that
there
is
a
problem.
we
are
working
on
meeting
that
problem.
we
have
a
terrific
financial
burden
that
we
have
to
work
out
because
no
city
across
the
nation
today
with
all
the
needs
of
the
city
and
with
the
great
pressing
demand
for
tech
sharing
is
the
position
to
meet
this
kind
if
an
overpowering
burden.
while
that
may
not
be
excused
to
pollution,
there
is
a
practical
situation
that
the
special
master
would
likewise
have
to
deal
with
because
this
will
not
go
away
with
the
waiving
of
the
magic
wand.
the
problem
is
there.
it’s
got
to
be
solved.
we’re
doing
our
best
to
solve
it
mr.
harry
g.
slater
mr.
chief
justice,
are
you
speaking
about
the
state
department
of
natural
resources?
mr.
harry
g.
slater
i
would
think
that
the
state
department
of
natural
resources
felt
that
we
were
not
showing
good
faith
and
the
response
which
they
had
a
reasonable
right
to
anticipate.
they
could
go
into
court
and
deal
with
us
accordingly.
i’m
satisfied
too
that
if
they
felt
that
way,
they
would
not
hesitate
to
do
it
not
withstanding
illinois’
claim
that
this
is
a
totally
partisanship
arrangement.
mr.
harry
g.
slater
i
assume
they
could
say
it
but
i
assume
that
they’re
also
practical
engineers
and
they
know
that
by
saying
it
this
cannot
be
accomplished
if
so.
i
wish
it
could.
this
is
not
the
ordinary
problem.
mr.
harry
g.
slater
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
assume
that
they
could
do
that
under
the
broad
powers
that
they
have
on
the
chapter
144
of
this
wisconsin
statute.
yes,
i
would
have
to
answer
yes.
at
least,
that’s
my
observation.
mr.
harry
g.
slater
that
is
correct.
mr.
justice
because
the
state
department
of
natural
resources
is
not
a
judicial
body,
it
is
a
quasi-judicial
body.
it
is
primarily
administrative
and
would
have
to
act
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
wisconsin.
mr.
harry
g.
slater
that
is
correct
and
may
i
also
add
--
mr.
harry
g.
slater
well,
if
you
have
that
view,
we’d
accept
it.
the
view
that
we
have
mentioned
here
today
was
the
practical
ones.
mr.
harry
g.
slater
well,
that
is
an
equitable
consideration.
i
assume
that
you
are
going
to
court
to
try
to
get
an
injunction
against
us.
this
would
be
within
the
broad
scope
of
the
equitable
powers
of
the
reviewing
tribunal.
so,
that
the
courts
are
there
and
may
add
this,
i
don’t
think
that
illinois
need
have
any
fear.
we
have
very
excellent
trial
courts
and
we
assume
the
same
would
be
true
if
we
had
to
go
into
illinois.
i
see
no
problem
there.
