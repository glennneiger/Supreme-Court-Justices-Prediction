justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask,
if
mrs.
richardson
were
now
asked
to
take
the
oath
for
stopping
the
word
massachusetts
state
violating
the
injunction
which
the
district
court
granted?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
if
the
decision
and
the
opinion
seems
to
treat
the
two
parts
separately
and
indicate
that
the
first
part
used
in
the
authority
in
knight
is
constitutional
and
that
revises
then
the
“i
will
oppose”
part.
of
course,
the
injunction
that
was
entered
and
the
declaratory
judgment
was
likewise
that
the
whole
oath
is
invalid,
section
is
invalid
and
the
injunction
is
against
a
prohibition
based
upon
her
refusal
to
take
the
oath
required
by
the
section,
so
that
the
massachusetts
will
though
say
well,
we
would
not
ask
you
to
take
the
oath
required
by
the
section,
but
only
an
oath
ending
up
with
the
word
“massachusetts.”
do
you
still
think
that
would
violate
the
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
that,
that
is
a
matter
of
the
massachusetts
legislature?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
said
it
was,
and
therefore,
it
cannot
be
treated
as
severable?
