mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
well,
i
am
not
sure
that
i
do
agree
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
i
think
that
is
one
possibility.
i
thought
originally
the
question
was
addressed
to
clause
one
of
the
oath,
if
in
fact
we
are
referring
to
clause
two
the
“to
oppose
the
overthrow,”
i
think
clearly,
it
could
be
much
more
difficult
not
only
for
communist,
but
for
anarchist
or
anyone
else
who
believe
under
certain
circumstances,
that
violent
overthrow
of
the
government
ought
to
be
brought
about
to
take
that
portion
of
the
oath
in
good
conscience.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
there
is
no
reference
as
there
was
in
the
connell
concededly
to
belief.
it
is
a
straightforward
promissory
oath
of
future
intent.
however,
i
would
argue
and
do
argue
that
--
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
well,
the
oath
specifies
“i
will
oppose”
i
would
argue
that
that
requires
an
affirmation
of
the
time
the
oath
has
taken,
the
instance
that
the
potential
employee
or
is
it
just
as
someone
about
to
take
the
witness
stand
in
a
trial
will
be
required
to
swear
to
the
truth
of
what
he
is
about
to
say,
that
he
intends
from
that
time
or
forward,
to
act
in
conformity
with
the
words
which
he
repeated.
otherwise
the
oath
cannot
have
any
meaning.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
i
must
confess
with
some
slight
embarrassment
since
i
am
appearing
pro
hac
vice
being
three
days
short
of
eligibility
for
the
admission
of
bar,
the
court,
i
have
not
yet
taken
that
oath.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
i
have
not
mr.
chief
justice,
frankly.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
well,
i
have
tried
to
suggest
that
i
feel
it
is
more
than
conduct
insofar
as
it
does
require,
if
the
oath
has
to
be
taken,
it
has
more
than
amenity
and
clearly
there
are
those
who
like
my
brother
mr.
mayo
feel
that
it
is
only
an
amenity,
but
if
it
is
to
me
more
than
an
amenity,
it
has
got
to
comport
with
your
belief
at
that
time
as
to
how
you
govern
your
future
conduct
and
of
course
we
just
believe
in
that
sense.
how
could
you,
consistent
with
a
belief
in
violent
overthrow
under
some
circumstances,
take
the
oath
part
two
as
required
by
massachusetts
and
i
suggest
that
--
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
yes,
i
agree
that
we
are
bound
to
uphold
a
court
and
a
judicial
system,
but
we
are
not
required
as
this
oath
suggests
on
one
interpretation
to
necessarily
undertake
arms
or
take
any
other
action
to
physically
or
even
verbally
oppose
the
overthrow
of
the
state
or
federal
government
which
is
what
part
two
purports
to
say.
of
course,
i
have
recognized
that
one
of
the
difficulties
here
in
talking
about
what
part
two
does
purport
to
require
or
say
is
that
no
one
can
really
provide
a
satisfactory
definition
of
that
language.
mr.
justice
stewart
i
think,
had
pointed
a
very
basic
grammatical
problem
which
i
would
never
have
been
able
to
resolve
to
my
own
satisfaction,
which
is
whether
or
not
the
reference
two
“force,
violence,
illegal,
unconstitutional
method”
modifies
the
words
“oppose”
or
the
word
“overthrow.”
i
think
it
is
just
one
example
of
the
vagueness
found
in
the
second
portion
of
the
oath,
the
more
fundamental
problem
being
exactly
what
do
those
illusive
words
“oppose
the
overthrow”
mean
and
the
very
fact
that
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
in
three
years
of
arguments
and
again
today
before
this
court
is
basically
unable
to
offer
a
satisfactory
example
of
what
that
language
means
i
think
suggests
how
very
vague
and
illusive
it
is
and
therefore
does
bring
it
within
the
purview
of
such
cases
in
baggett
and
bullitt
and
cramp
and
board
of
public
instruction
which
were
struck
down
similarly
for
vagueness.
i
would
like
to
respond,
if
i
may,
to
the
commonwealth
position
that
the
appellees’
arguments
with
regard
to
first
amendment
freedom
is
speculative
and
conjectural.
i
think
the
court,
this
court
has
clearly
faced
that
problem
many
times
before.
mr.
justice
white
addressed
himself
forcedly
to
that
in
baggett
and
bullitt,
particularly
at
page
373
when
he
talked
about
the
dangers
of
conduct
which
might
be
deterred
by
vague
oaths,
the
control
which
such
an
oath
gives
a
prosecutor
who
might
wish
to
deter
speech,
association
and
the
like.
i
suggest
that
mrs.
richardson
or
any
other
employee
of
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
in
the
1970
census
indicates
that
approximately
167,000
such
employees
who
would
have
been
exposed
sometime
during
the
period
of
their
employment,
to
require
them
take
this
oath.
they
have
no
real
way
to
find
out
whether
or
not
with
these
fears
about
first
amendment
freedoms
and
prosecution
for
violation
of
the
injunction
of
the
oath
or
speculative
or
conjectural,
except
to
go
ahead
and
take
the
oath
and
take
the
risk,
and
that
is
exactly
why
this
court
has
quite
properly
struck
down
such
oaths
in
the
past.
the
other
alternative
is
of
course
the
one
that
mrs.
richardson,
in
this
case,
chose.
it
has
caused
her
to
date
a
three-year
wait
since
she
was
fired
in
november
1968,
refusing
to
take
the
oath,
but
that
is
to
refuse
to
take
the
oath
at
all.
of
course,
in
such
cases
as
wadmond
and
updegraff
and
later
cases,
this
court
had
said
that,
however
you
style
government
employment,
whether
you
consider
it
a
benefit
or
privilege
or
what,
you
cannot
justify
either
exclusion
or
punishment
because
of
such
an
oath,
where
it
is
unduly
vague
or
over
broad.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
i
agree
that
that
would
clarify,
but
i
feel
that
it
is
equally
unconstitutional,
clearly
following
the
line
of
such
cases
as
barnette
and
west
virginia
board
of
education
where
it
was
said
that
consistent
with
those
school
children's
beliefs
in
another
duty,
in
another
system,
they
could
not
be
compelled
to
take
the
flag
salute.
i
do
not
think
that
mrs.
richardson
or
any
employee
merely
because
she
becomes
an
employee,
is
required
to
take
physical
action
or
to
speak
out.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
either
one.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
yes,
it
is,
your
honor,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
my
position
essentially
is
this.
first
it
is
so
vague
that
neither
mrs.
richardson
nor
in
fact
the
commonwealth
knows
what
is
required,
but
what
it
would
require
--
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
we
would
grant
your
question,
mr.
justice
white
and
to
say,
alright,
this
is
all
the
oath
does
mean.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
i
suggest
the
sliding
scale
of
possibilities,
for
example.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
with
a
whole
range
and
a
host
of
possibilities
in
between.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
were
a
constitutional?
i
suggest
that
under
this
court’s
construction
--
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
i
suggest
that
under
this
court’s
construction
of
the
cases,
none
of
those
things
could
be
required,
but
i
say
if
the
oath
read
as
you
have
just
suggested
--
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
well,
in
my
reading
of
the
cases,
i
think
this
court
has
frequently
talked
about
both
of
them
as
different
sides
of
the
same
coin,
that
coin
being
basically
first
amendment
freedoms,
particularly
speech
and
association
and
the
deterrence
which
very
frequently
results
when
an
employee
like
mrs.
richardson
or
anyone
else
is
faced
with
necessity
of
taking
such
an
oath.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
well,
the
district
court
suggested,
as
my
brother
mayo
has
said,
a
range
of
meanings
for
“oppose”
from
actively
oppose
as
to
do
something
to
merely
refraining
from
some
conduct
themselves,
to
get
on
the
different
ends
of
the
spectrum.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
support
is
quite
close.
in
fact
it
is
the
same
word
that
this
court
approved
in
connell
and
higginbotham.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
well,
the
line
of
cases
which
include
connell
and
higginbotham
and
before
that
knight
and
ohlson
which
were
both
procuring
affirmances
do
not
really
discuss
the
question
you
have
read
and
i
admit
it
is
a
troubling
and
puzzling
one.
i
think
that
the
only
real
and
fair
answer
is
that
the
constitution
itself
in
article
6,
section
3
has
a
general
requirement
in
support
of
the
constitution.
and
i
think,
if
in
fact
as
mr.
mayo
appears
to
argue
at
one
point
in
his
brief,
if
the
oath
merely
said
“and
i
oppose
the
overthrow”
it
would
be
a
tougher
case,
but
it
does
not
say,
“i
oppose
the
overthrow.”
it
says,
“i
will
oppose
the
overthrow.”
the
key
there
i
think
being
“will,”
meaning
that
only
mrs.
richardson,
perhaps
on
one
construction,
got
to
refrain
from
action
herself
or
wonder
in
her-(inaudible)
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
i
think
that
“i
oppose”
would
have
the
same
constitutional
defect
of
vagueness,
but
i
suggest
that
it
might
be
an
easier
case
than
“i
will
oppose”
which
requires
a
public
employee
in
massachusetts
to
assess
somebody
else’s
conduct,
not
just
his
own,
not
just
to
govern
his
own
conduct
as
“i
support
the
constitution”
does,
but
to
go
out
and
make
a
judgment.
let
us
say
as
he
passes
the
state
house
of
the
boston
common
during
the
day,
he
is
a
speaker
urging
violent
revolution.
is
this
overthrow
of
the
government,
am
i
required
to
do
something,
if
so,
what
is
it?
a
whole
host
of
possibilities
are
there.
i
do
not
think
any
fair
choice
can
be
made
by
that
employee
consistent
with
the
first
amendment.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
yes.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
yes.
the
problem
with
the
whole
oath
is
that
the
two
parts,
at
least
that
the
attorney
general
argues
and
this
is
a
plausible
construction,
do
appear
to
be
linked.
there
is
no
indication,
but
they
are
particularly
separable.
i
think
for
that
reason,
the
district
court
properly
struck
down
the
entire
oath.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
grammatically
it
is
separable.
i
think
in
its
intent,
particularly
if
the
word
“defend”
in
the
first
portion
of
the
oath
is
linked
with
“oppose”
in
the
second
portion,
they
are
not
necessarily
separable.
we
are
not
favoring
with
any
legislative
history
here
by
the
commonwealth
of
the
massachusetts
to
help
us
unfortunately.
and
the
supreme
judicial
court,
in
its
closet
pronouncement,
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts,
several
years
ago
suggested
that
in
construing
a
teacher’s
oath
which
was
not
too
dissimilar,
it
would
prefer
to
leave
such
ultimate
constitutional
questions
interestingly
enough
to
this
court
rather
than
pronounce
on
the
point
itself.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
the
entire
oath
or
the
second
portion?
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
i
think
that
would
clearly
conflict
with
belief
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
because
the
person
might
or
might
not
in
fact
be
against
the
overthrow
consistent
with
decisions
of
this
court
including
the
bar
admission
cases
decided
last
term.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
but,
it
does
require
and
compel
expression
of
belief
as
of
that
moment
(voice
overlap)
which
i
do
not
think.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
yes,
which
i
do
not
think
consistent
with
the
first
amendment,
it
cannot
be
compelled.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
i
believe
that
it
would
mr.
justice
brennan
because
i
believe
that
the
injunction
and
the
decision
both
go
to
the
entire
oath.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
i
think
it
would,
because
of
the
specific
language,
first
of
all
in
the
judgment
injunction,
that
section
14
of
chapter
264
violates
the
first
amendment,
not
section
14,
clause
2
of
the
oath.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
if
the
legislature
reenacted
such
an
oath,
it
is
conceivable
that
--
it
is
obvious
that
mrs.
richardson
could
be
again
asked
to
do
it.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
i
think
first
of
all
this
oath
as
i
suggested
is
not
clearly
severable.
secondly
there
is
no
indication
--
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
yes.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
yes.
i
think
the
most
proper
course
if
you
are
going
to
sustain
the
judgment
of
the
three-judge
court
as
i
hope
you
would
and
the
injunction
would
be
again
to
affirm
striking
down
the
entire
oath
and
let
the
legislature
in
massachusetts
do
with
this
oath
or
any
other
oath
what
it
chooses
in
light
of
the
decision.
i
think
it
should
be
made
clear
that
the
second
portion
of
this
oath
which
i
suggest
is
tied
firmly
to
the
first
portion
is
constitutionally
defective.
i
would
like
to
make
one
more
point
with
regard
to
freedom
of
association,
which
again
my
brother
suggested,
is
speculative
and
conjectural.
i
think
clearly
under
the
--
within
the
problems
created
by
the
part
two
of
the
oath,
someone
like
mrs.
richardson,
any
state
employee
in
massachusetts,
might
well
wish
to
join
any
group
even
the
so
called
fun
group,
which
had
stated
purposes,
something
very
innocent
like
preserving
forest
in
massachusetts,
one
of
the
other
aims
of
this
group
could
obviously
be
violent
overthrow
of
the
government
and
the
decisions
of
this
court,
as
i
understand
them,
mrs.
richardson
could
not
be
convicted
of
attempting
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government
unless
there
was
skiyente
(ph)
precedent,
unless
she
herself
had
the
actual
intent
to
overthrow
the
government.
but,
i
think
in
terms
of
part
two
of
the
oath,
the
“i
will
oppose”
she
could
clearly
be
deemed
in
conflict
by
a
prosecutor
at
anytime,
notwithstanding
what
my
brother
says,
the
20-year
history
of
non-prosecution
in
massachusetts.
the
test
is
not
i
think
lack
of
prosecution.
it
is
deterrence
of
the
first
amendment
conduct
and
i
think
that
is
the
crucial
issue
here.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
i
agree
that
it
is
personal
and
future,
but
i
do
not
think
that
any
bar
through
a
prosecutor
going
out
to
mrs.
richardson
for
violation
of
at
least
the
second
portion
if
she
were
found
to
be
a
member
of
a
group
like
the
one
i
suggested,
which
in
fact
had
as
one
of
its
tenants,
though
she
might
be
unaware
of
it,
or
although
she
might
be
a
passive
or
inactive
member
or
not
even
in
favor
of
it
as
this
court
suggested
in
united
states
and
noble
(ph)
decided
several
years
ago,
she
can
still
be
prosecuted.
there
is
an
additional
--
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
i
say
that
--
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
my
proposition
is
only
that,
in
terms
of
the
words
of
the
oath
requiring
a
future
promise
of
opposition.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
yes.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
yes.
a
future
association
or
even
an
association
at
the
time
she
took
the
oath
which
was
inconsistent
because
of
some
aim
of
that
group
which
was
in
fact
in
favor
of
a
violent
overthrow
of
the
government
or
by
illegal
unconstitutional
methods.
a
massachusetts
prosecutor
could
prosecute
mrs.
richardson
under
the
oath.
i
think
that
she
would
not,
even
though
she
might
be
sustained
by
this
court
or
some
other
court,
eventually
she
would
not
be
in
very
effective
position
to
argue
as
my
brother
has
suggested
that
well,
after
all
the
oath
is
only
an
amenity,
it
did
not
mean
very
much,
the
state
considers
it
only
as
an
amenity.
so
i
do
not
really
have
an
obligation
to
live
up
for
the
terms
of
that
future
promise.
if
the
oath,
this
oath
or
any
other
oath
is
going
to
mean
anything
in
this
country,
then
i
think
that
has
to
be
clear,
not
vague,
not
broad,
and
straight
forward
and
this
one
is
not.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
the
only
standards
which
it
would
appear
to
be
consistent
that
this
court
has
said
would
be
the
language
of
the
connell
oath
part
one
or
the
language
required
by
the
constitution
support
and
uphold.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
i
think
that
support
--
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
--
or
uphold
have
come
to
be
traditional
words
associated
with
the
kind
of
minimal
residual
loyalty
which
we
have
decided
under
the
constitution,
in
fact,
in
article
6,
section
3
from
the
very
beginning.
we
have
allowed
the
constitution
to
be
exacted
from
public
employees
and
public
officers
and
the
like.
something
beyond
that,
creates
clearly
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
past,
questions
of
unconstitutionality.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
i
think
that
uphold
or
support
which
have
been
read
by
the
court
below
and
by
this
court
i
think
is
roughly
synonymous,
have
this
historical
context.
what
you
are
saying
is,
you
believe
in
the
system
for
which
you
are
working
under
which
you
live.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
if
the
question
were
open
to
me
for
the
first
time
today,
i
think
i
would
make
a
strong
argument
that
support
and
uphold
certainly
requires,
some
affirmation
of
belief.
however,
i
think
this
court's
recent
pronouncements,
including
connell
and
higginbotham
leave
that
question
closed.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
i
think
in
terms
of
the
future
conduct,
in
terms
of
the
number
of
variance
of
acquired
conduct
which
the
state
itself
has
suggested
in
three
years
of
this
case,
that
“oppose”
appears
to
be
much
more
illusive
for
all
of
us
than
“support
or
uphold.”
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
at
least
the
last
part
of
that
“that
i
will
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states”
clearly
does
not
go
any
farther
than
the
connell
language
or
the
constitutional
language
which
(voice
overlap)
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
it
seems
to
me
that
is
a
simple
promise
of
conduct
consistent
with
being
an
officer
of
the
bar.
it
does
not
necessarily
go
with
ultimate
philosophical
or
political
beliefs
about
the
utility
of
this
court
or
any
other
court.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
i
personally
would
take
the
oath.
i
do
not
feel
it
is
inconsistent
with
(voice
overlap)
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
i
do
not
think
that
is
what
it
tells
us.
i
think
that
goes
to
your
conduct
in
a
particular
profession,
the
rules
of
the
game.
if
massachusetts
were
suggesting
here
that
they
are
trying
to
regulate
all
employees
because
of
some
security
sensitivity
involved
as
the
federal
government
and
other
state
governments
have
argued
in
other
cases,
it
would
be
a
different
situation,
but
there
is
no
suggestion
by
the
commonwealth
today.
i
do
not
find
any
in
this
brief
that
such
a
broad
oath
across
the
board
affecting
all
employees
is
necessary
to
security
sensitivity
or
for
the
effective,
orderly
working
of
state
government
or
any
other
compelling
state
interest.
record
that
the
commonwealth
has
made
seems
to
be
peculiarly
bare
of
any
suggestion
that
the
compelling
state
interest
for
this
oath.
in
fact,
they
suggested
it
is
an
amenity
as
i
say,
strange
things
that
they
require
in
that
case.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
well,
i
think
clearly,
in
light
of
our
discussion
in
the
last
half-hour,
that
becomes
a
narrower
case,
particularly
it
would
be
use
of
the
word
“defend.”
i
see
vagueness,
difficulty
is
there
as
i
do
in
the
word
“defend”
in
clause
1
of
the
massachusetts
oath.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
i
think
i
would
elude
now
to
my
previous
conversation
with
mr.
justice
white
and
say
that
there
are
certain
oaths
or
general
terms
of
support
which
had
been
with
us
since
the
beginning.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
i
can
only
suggest
again
that
in
all
honesty,
the
range
of
meanings
of
word
“oppose”
when
set
aside
as
it
is
here
in
clause
2
and
not
linked
by
implication
with
“support
and
uphold”
as
in
the
presidential
oath
that
you
read
does
create
much
greater
difficulties
both
in
terms
of
vagueness
and
in
terms
of
broadness
deterring
both
speech
and
association.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
i
think
an
oath
that
says
“i
will
defend
the
constitution”
is
quite
close
to
an
oath
that
simply
says
“i
will
support
the
constitution,”
they
are
really
the
same.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
yes.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
yes,
because
i
think
then
we
have
imported
more
language.
we
have
imported,
as
in
this
case,
the
government
of
massachusetts,
the
united
states
government,
force,
violence,
illegal,
unconstitutional
methods,
all
of
which
in
the
connection
like
the
present
one,
meaning
that
someone
like
mrs.
richardson,
as
i
say,
not
only
has
to
assess
her
own
conduct,
but
has
got
to
make
an
assessment
of
somebody
else's
conduct,
and
action
and
speech.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
yes,
it
can
be
and
i
think
it
is
in
this
oath,
although
it
is
particularly
the
words
“oppose
the
overthrow”
with
which
we
find
fault
in
this
oath,
not
the
word
“defend”.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
no,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
very
briefly,
in
making
our
brief,
i
would
make
today,
two
other
arguments.
one
i
have
i
think
touched
on
essentially
the
vagueness
argument
and
the
difficulty.
for
example,
in
a
situation
where
mrs.
richardson
or
any
other
employees
of
the
state,
were
to
sit
in
by
militants
of
the
state
house
in
massachusetts
or
at
the
federal
courthouse
or
the
federal
building
in
boston
which
just
happened
frequently
in
the
years
passed.
is
this
an
attempted
overthrow?
how
does
she
know?
is
she
required
the
act?
is
she
required
to
go
and
get
a
policeman?
just
what
is
she
supposed
to
do?
i
think
the
vagueness
problems
are
clear
enough
to
need,
i
hope
not
for
just
the
exposition.
final
point
is
that
the
statute
violates
due
process
as
the
connell
case
construed
in
last
term
and
that
provides
for
no
hearing
for
mrs.
richardson
or
any
other
employee
show,
why
she
refuses
to
take
the
oath.
no
opportunity
to
make
a
record
to
show
that
she
is
merely
a,
let
us
say
a
scrupulous
conscientious
woman
who
feels
because
the
vagueness
and
overbreadth
problem
in
this
oath
that
she
cannot
in
good
conscious
take
it.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
the
particular
problem
of
--
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
no
hearing.
i
do
not
think
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
the
only
provisions
in
the
oath
are
those
finally
open
it.
it
does
say
in
the
first
sentence,
“i
do
solemnly
swear
or
affirm.”
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
no,
it
could
be
an
affirmance
rather
than
a
swearing,
nonetheless
as
i
see
it
that
double
penalty
under
the
massachusetts
statute,
both
for
prosecuting
for
perjury
which
section
14
explicitly
refers
to,
and
under
section
15
of
the
same
chapter
264
for
violation
of
the
terms
of
the
oath,
whatever
that
may
be,
still
remain.
thank
you.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
well,
i
am
not
sure
that
i
do
agree
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
i
think
that
is
one
possibility.
i
thought
originally
the
question
was
addressed
to
clause
one
of
the
oath,
if
in
fact
we
are
referring
to
clause
two
the
“to
oppose
the
overthrow,”
i
think
clearly,
it
could
be
much
more
difficult
not
only
for
communist,
but
for
anarchist
or
anyone
else
who
believe
under
certain
circumstances,
that
violent
overthrow
of
the
government
ought
to
be
brought
about
to
take
that
portion
of
the
oath
in
good
conscience.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
there
is
no
reference
as
there
was
in
the
connell
concededly
to
belief.
it
is
a
straightforward
promissory
oath
of
future
intent.
however,
i
would
argue
and
do
argue
that
--
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
well,
the
oath
specifies
“i
will
oppose”
i
would
argue
that
that
requires
an
affirmation
of
the
time
the
oath
has
taken,
the
instance
that
the
potential
employee
or
is
it
just
as
someone
about
to
take
the
witness
stand
in
a
trial
will
be
required
to
swear
to
the
truth
of
what
he
is
about
to
say,
that
he
intends
from
that
time
or
forward,
to
act
in
conformity
with
the
words
which
he
repeated.
otherwise
the
oath
cannot
have
any
meaning.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
i
must
confess
with
some
slight
embarrassment
since
i
am
appearing
pro
hac
vice
being
three
days
short
of
eligibility
for
the
admission
of
bar,
the
court,
i
have
not
yet
taken
that
oath.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
i
have
not
mr.
chief
justice,
frankly.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
well,
i
have
tried
to
suggest
that
i
feel
it
is
more
than
conduct
insofar
as
it
does
require,
if
the
oath
has
to
be
taken,
it
has
more
than
amenity
and
clearly
there
are
those
who
like
my
brother
mr.
mayo
feel
that
it
is
only
an
amenity,
but
if
it
is
to
me
more
than
an
amenity,
it
has
got
to
comport
with
your
belief
at
that
time
as
to
how
you
govern
your
future
conduct
and
of
course
we
just
believe
in
that
sense.
how
could
you,
consistent
with
a
belief
in
violent
overthrow
under
some
circumstances,
take
the
oath
part
two
as
required
by
massachusetts
and
i
suggest
that
--
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
yes,
i
agree
that
we
are
bound
to
uphold
a
court
and
a
judicial
system,
but
we
are
not
required
as
this
oath
suggests
on
one
interpretation
to
necessarily
undertake
arms
or
take
any
other
action
to
physically
or
even
verbally
oppose
the
overthrow
of
the
state
or
federal
government
which
is
what
part
two
purports
to
say.
of
course,
i
have
recognized
that
one
of
the
difficulties
here
in
talking
about
what
part
two
does
purport
to
require
or
say
is
that
no
one
can
really
provide
a
satisfactory
definition
of
that
language.
mr.
justice
stewart
i
think,
had
pointed
a
very
basic
grammatical
problem
which
i
would
never
have
been
able
to
resolve
to
my
own
satisfaction,
which
is
whether
or
not
the
reference
two
“force,
violence,
illegal,
unconstitutional
method”
modifies
the
words
“oppose”
or
the
word
“overthrow.”
i
think
it
is
just
one
example
of
the
vagueness
found
in
the
second
portion
of
the
oath,
the
more
fundamental
problem
being
exactly
what
do
those
illusive
words
“oppose
the
overthrow”
mean
and
the
very
fact
that
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
in
three
years
of
arguments
and
again
today
before
this
court
is
basically
unable
to
offer
a
satisfactory
example
of
what
that
language
means
i
think
suggests
how
very
vague
and
illusive
it
is
and
therefore
does
bring
it
within
the
purview
of
such
cases
in
baggett
and
bullitt
and
cramp
and
board
of
public
instruction
which
were
struck
down
similarly
for
vagueness.
i
would
like
to
respond,
if
i
may,
to
the
commonwealth
position
that
the
appellees’
arguments
with
regard
to
first
amendment
freedom
is
speculative
and
conjectural.
i
think
the
court,
this
court
has
clearly
faced
that
problem
many
times
before.
mr.
justice
white
addressed
himself
forcedly
to
that
in
baggett
and
bullitt,
particularly
at
page
373
when
he
talked
about
the
dangers
of
conduct
which
might
be
deterred
by
vague
oaths,
the
control
which
such
an
oath
gives
a
prosecutor
who
might
wish
to
deter
speech,
association
and
the
like.
i
suggest
that
mrs.
richardson
or
any
other
employee
of
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
in
the
1970
census
indicates
that
approximately
167,000
such
employees
who
would
have
been
exposed
sometime
during
the
period
of
their
employment,
to
require
them
take
this
oath.
they
have
no
real
way
to
find
out
whether
or
not
with
these
fears
about
first
amendment
freedoms
and
prosecution
for
violation
of
the
injunction
of
the
oath
or
speculative
or
conjectural,
except
to
go
ahead
and
take
the
oath
and
take
the
risk,
and
that
is
exactly
why
this
court
has
quite
properly
struck
down
such
oaths
in
the
past.
the
other
alternative
is
of
course
the
one
that
mrs.
richardson,
in
this
case,
chose.
it
has
caused
her
to
date
a
three-year
wait
since
she
was
fired
in
november
1968,
refusing
to
take
the
oath,
but
that
is
to
refuse
to
take
the
oath
at
all.
of
course,
in
such
cases
as
wadmond
and
updegraff
and
later
cases,
this
court
had
said
that,
however
you
style
government
employment,
whether
you
consider
it
a
benefit
or
privilege
or
what,
you
cannot
justify
either
exclusion
or
punishment
because
of
such
an
oath,
where
it
is
unduly
vague
or
over
broad.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
i
agree
that
that
would
clarify,
but
i
feel
that
it
is
equally
unconstitutional,
clearly
following
the
line
of
such
cases
as
barnette
and
west
virginia
board
of
education
where
it
was
said
that
consistent
with
those
school
children's
beliefs
in
another
duty,
in
another
system,
they
could
not
be
compelled
to
take
the
flag
salute.
i
do
not
think
that
mrs.
richardson
or
any
employee
merely
because
she
becomes
an
employee,
is
required
to
take
physical
action
or
to
speak
out.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
either
one.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
yes,
it
is,
your
honor,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
my
position
essentially
is
this.
first
it
is
so
vague
that
neither
mrs.
richardson
nor
in
fact
the
commonwealth
knows
what
is
required,
but
what
it
would
require
--
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
we
would
grant
your
question,
mr.
justice
white
and
to
say,
alright,
this
is
all
the
oath
does
mean.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
i
suggest
the
sliding
scale
of
possibilities,
for
example.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
with
a
whole
range
and
a
host
of
possibilities
in
between.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
were
a
constitutional?
i
suggest
that
under
this
court’s
construction
--
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
i
suggest
that
under
this
court’s
construction
of
the
cases,
none
of
those
things
could
be
required,
but
i
say
if
the
oath
read
as
you
have
just
suggested
--
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
well,
in
my
reading
of
the
cases,
i
think
this
court
has
frequently
talked
about
both
of
them
as
different
sides
of
the
same
coin,
that
coin
being
basically
first
amendment
freedoms,
particularly
speech
and
association
and
the
deterrence
which
very
frequently
results
when
an
employee
like
mrs.
richardson
or
anyone
else
is
faced
with
necessity
of
taking
such
an
oath.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
well,
the
district
court
suggested,
as
my
brother
mayo
has
said,
a
range
of
meanings
for
“oppose”
from
actively
oppose
as
to
do
something
to
merely
refraining
from
some
conduct
themselves,
to
get
on
the
different
ends
of
the
spectrum.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
support
is
quite
close.
in
fact
it
is
the
same
word
that
this
court
approved
in
connell
and
higginbotham.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
well,
the
line
of
cases
which
include
connell
and
higginbotham
and
before
that
knight
and
ohlson
which
were
both
procuring
affirmances
do
not
really
discuss
the
question
you
have
read
and
i
admit
it
is
a
troubling
and
puzzling
one.
i
think
that
the
only
real
and
fair
answer
is
that
the
constitution
itself
in
article
6,
section
3
has
a
general
requirement
in
support
of
the
constitution.
and
i
think,
if
in
fact
as
mr.
mayo
appears
to
argue
at
one
point
in
his
brief,
if
the
oath
merely
said
“and
i
oppose
the
overthrow”
it
would
be
a
tougher
case,
but
it
does
not
say,
“i
oppose
the
overthrow.”
it
says,
“i
will
oppose
the
overthrow.”
the
key
there
i
think
being
“will,”
meaning
that
only
mrs.
richardson,
perhaps
on
one
construction,
got
to
refrain
from
action
herself
or
wonder
in
her-(inaudible)
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
i
think
that
“i
oppose”
would
have
the
same
constitutional
defect
of
vagueness,
but
i
suggest
that
it
might
be
an
easier
case
than
“i
will
oppose”
which
requires
a
public
employee
in
massachusetts
to
assess
somebody
else’s
conduct,
not
just
his
own,
not
just
to
govern
his
own
conduct
as
“i
support
the
constitution”
does,
but
to
go
out
and
make
a
judgment.
let
us
say
as
he
passes
the
state
house
of
the
boston
common
during
the
day,
he
is
a
speaker
urging
violent
revolution.
is
this
overthrow
of
the
government,
am
i
required
to
do
something,
if
so,
what
is
it?
a
whole
host
of
possibilities
are
there.
i
do
not
think
any
fair
choice
can
be
made
by
that
employee
consistent
with
the
first
amendment.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
yes.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
yes.
the
problem
with
the
whole
oath
is
that
the
two
parts,
at
least
that
the
attorney
general
argues
and
this
is
a
plausible
construction,
do
appear
to
be
linked.
there
is
no
indication,
but
they
are
particularly
separable.
i
think
for
that
reason,
the
district
court
properly
struck
down
the
entire
oath.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
grammatically
it
is
separable.
i
think
in
its
intent,
particularly
if
the
word
“defend”
in
the
first
portion
of
the
oath
is
linked
with
“oppose”
in
the
second
portion,
they
are
not
necessarily
separable.
we
are
not
favoring
with
any
legislative
history
here
by
the
commonwealth
of
the
massachusetts
to
help
us
unfortunately.
and
the
supreme
judicial
court,
in
its
closet
pronouncement,
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts,
several
years
ago
suggested
that
in
construing
a
teacher’s
oath
which
was
not
too
dissimilar,
it
would
prefer
to
leave
such
ultimate
constitutional
questions
interestingly
enough
to
this
court
rather
than
pronounce
on
the
point
itself.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
the
entire
oath
or
the
second
portion?
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
i
think
that
would
clearly
conflict
with
belief
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
because
the
person
might
or
might
not
in
fact
be
against
the
overthrow
consistent
with
decisions
of
this
court
including
the
bar
admission
cases
decided
last
term.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
but,
it
does
require
and
compel
expression
of
belief
as
of
that
moment
(voice
overlap)
which
i
do
not
think.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
yes,
which
i
do
not
think
consistent
with
the
first
amendment,
it
cannot
be
compelled.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
i
believe
that
it
would
mr.
justice
brennan
because
i
believe
that
the
injunction
and
the
decision
both
go
to
the
entire
oath.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
i
think
it
would,
because
of
the
specific
language,
first
of
all
in
the
judgment
injunction,
that
section
14
of
chapter
264
violates
the
first
amendment,
not
section
14,
clause
2
of
the
oath.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
if
the
legislature
reenacted
such
an
oath,
it
is
conceivable
that
--
it
is
obvious
that
mrs.
richardson
could
be
again
asked
to
do
it.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
i
think
first
of
all
this
oath
as
i
suggested
is
not
clearly
severable.
secondly
there
is
no
indication
--
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
yes.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
yes.
i
think
the
most
proper
course
if
you
are
going
to
sustain
the
judgment
of
the
three-judge
court
as
i
hope
you
would
and
the
injunction
would
be
again
to
affirm
striking
down
the
entire
oath
and
let
the
legislature
in
massachusetts
do
with
this
oath
or
any
other
oath
what
it
chooses
in
light
of
the
decision.
i
think
it
should
be
made
clear
that
the
second
portion
of
this
oath
which
i
suggest
is
tied
firmly
to
the
first
portion
is
constitutionally
defective.
i
would
like
to
make
one
more
point
with
regard
to
freedom
of
association,
which
again
my
brother
suggested,
is
speculative
and
conjectural.
i
think
clearly
under
the
--
within
the
problems
created
by
the
part
two
of
the
oath,
someone
like
mrs.
richardson,
any
state
employee
in
massachusetts,
might
well
wish
to
join
any
group
even
the
so
called
fun
group,
which
had
stated
purposes,
something
very
innocent
like
preserving
forest
in
massachusetts,
one
of
the
other
aims
of
this
group
could
obviously
be
violent
overthrow
of
the
government
and
the
decisions
of
this
court,
as
i
understand
them,
mrs.
richardson
could
not
be
convicted
of
attempting
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government
unless
there
was
skiyente
(ph)
precedent,
unless
she
herself
had
the
actual
intent
to
overthrow
the
government.
but,
i
think
in
terms
of
part
two
of
the
oath,
the
“i
will
oppose”
she
could
clearly
be
deemed
in
conflict
by
a
prosecutor
at
anytime,
notwithstanding
what
my
brother
says,
the
20-year
history
of
non-prosecution
in
massachusetts.
the
test
is
not
i
think
lack
of
prosecution.
it
is
deterrence
of
the
first
amendment
conduct
and
i
think
that
is
the
crucial
issue
here.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
i
agree
that
it
is
personal
and
future,
but
i
do
not
think
that
any
bar
through
a
prosecutor
going
out
to
mrs.
richardson
for
violation
of
at
least
the
second
portion
if
she
were
found
to
be
a
member
of
a
group
like
the
one
i
suggested,
which
in
fact
had
as
one
of
its
tenants,
though
she
might
be
unaware
of
it,
or
although
she
might
be
a
passive
or
inactive
member
or
not
even
in
favor
of
it
as
this
court
suggested
in
united
states
and
noble
(ph)
decided
several
years
ago,
she
can
still
be
prosecuted.
there
is
an
additional
--
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
i
say
that
--
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
my
proposition
is
only
that,
in
terms
of
the
words
of
the
oath
requiring
a
future
promise
of
opposition.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
yes.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
yes.
a
future
association
or
even
an
association
at
the
time
she
took
the
oath
which
was
inconsistent
because
of
some
aim
of
that
group
which
was
in
fact
in
favor
of
a
violent
overthrow
of
the
government
or
by
illegal
unconstitutional
methods.
a
massachusetts
prosecutor
could
prosecute
mrs.
richardson
under
the
oath.
i
think
that
she
would
not,
even
though
she
might
be
sustained
by
this
court
or
some
other
court,
eventually
she
would
not
be
in
very
effective
position
to
argue
as
my
brother
has
suggested
that
well,
after
all
the
oath
is
only
an
amenity,
it
did
not
mean
very
much,
the
state
considers
it
only
as
an
amenity.
so
i
do
not
really
have
an
obligation
to
live
up
for
the
terms
of
that
future
promise.
if
the
oath,
this
oath
or
any
other
oath
is
going
to
mean
anything
in
this
country,
then
i
think
that
has
to
be
clear,
not
vague,
not
broad,
and
straight
forward
and
this
one
is
not.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
the
only
standards
which
it
would
appear
to
be
consistent
that
this
court
has
said
would
be
the
language
of
the
connell
oath
part
one
or
the
language
required
by
the
constitution
support
and
uphold.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
i
think
that
support
--
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
--
or
uphold
have
come
to
be
traditional
words
associated
with
the
kind
of
minimal
residual
loyalty
which
we
have
decided
under
the
constitution,
in
fact,
in
article
6,
section
3
from
the
very
beginning.
we
have
allowed
the
constitution
to
be
exacted
from
public
employees
and
public
officers
and
the
like.
something
beyond
that,
creates
clearly
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
past,
questions
of
unconstitutionality.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
i
think
that
uphold
or
support
which
have
been
read
by
the
court
below
and
by
this
court
i
think
is
roughly
synonymous,
have
this
historical
context.
what
you
are
saying
is,
you
believe
in
the
system
for
which
you
are
working
under
which
you
live.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
if
the
question
were
open
to
me
for
the
first
time
today,
i
think
i
would
make
a
strong
argument
that
support
and
uphold
certainly
requires,
some
affirmation
of
belief.
however,
i
think
this
court's
recent
pronouncements,
including
connell
and
higginbotham
leave
that
question
closed.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
i
think
in
terms
of
the
future
conduct,
in
terms
of
the
number
of
variance
of
acquired
conduct
which
the
state
itself
has
suggested
in
three
years
of
this
case,
that
“oppose”
appears
to
be
much
more
illusive
for
all
of
us
than
“support
or
uphold.”
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
at
least
the
last
part
of
that
“that
i
will
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states”
clearly
does
not
go
any
farther
than
the
connell
language
or
the
constitutional
language
which
(voice
overlap)
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
it
seems
to
me
that
is
a
simple
promise
of
conduct
consistent
with
being
an
officer
of
the
bar.
it
does
not
necessarily
go
with
ultimate
philosophical
or
political
beliefs
about
the
utility
of
this
court
or
any
other
court.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
i
personally
would
take
the
oath.
i
do
not
feel
it
is
inconsistent
with
(voice
overlap)
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
i
do
not
think
that
is
what
it
tells
us.
i
think
that
goes
to
your
conduct
in
a
particular
profession,
the
rules
of
the
game.
if
massachusetts
were
suggesting
here
that
they
are
trying
to
regulate
all
employees
because
of
some
security
sensitivity
involved
as
the
federal
government
and
other
state
governments
have
argued
in
other
cases,
it
would
be
a
different
situation,
but
there
is
no
suggestion
by
the
commonwealth
today.
i
do
not
find
any
in
this
brief
that
such
a
broad
oath
across
the
board
affecting
all
employees
is
necessary
to
security
sensitivity
or
for
the
effective,
orderly
working
of
state
government
or
any
other
compelling
state
interest.
record
that
the
commonwealth
has
made
seems
to
be
peculiarly
bare
of
any
suggestion
that
the
compelling
state
interest
for
this
oath.
in
fact,
they
suggested
it
is
an
amenity
as
i
say,
strange
things
that
they
require
in
that
case.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
well,
i
think
clearly,
in
light
of
our
discussion
in
the
last
half-hour,
that
becomes
a
narrower
case,
particularly
it
would
be
use
of
the
word
“defend.”
i
see
vagueness,
difficulty
is
there
as
i
do
in
the
word
“defend”
in
clause
1
of
the
massachusetts
oath.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
i
think
i
would
elude
now
to
my
previous
conversation
with
mr.
justice
white
and
say
that
there
are
certain
oaths
or
general
terms
of
support
which
had
been
with
us
since
the
beginning.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
i
can
only
suggest
again
that
in
all
honesty,
the
range
of
meanings
of
word
“oppose”
when
set
aside
as
it
is
here
in
clause
2
and
not
linked
by
implication
with
“support
and
uphold”
as
in
the
presidential
oath
that
you
read
does
create
much
greater
difficulties
both
in
terms
of
vagueness
and
in
terms
of
broadness
deterring
both
speech
and
association.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
i
think
an
oath
that
says
“i
will
defend
the
constitution”
is
quite
close
to
an
oath
that
simply
says
“i
will
support
the
constitution,”
they
are
really
the
same.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
yes.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
yes,
because
i
think
then
we
have
imported
more
language.
we
have
imported,
as
in
this
case,
the
government
of
massachusetts,
the
united
states
government,
force,
violence,
illegal,
unconstitutional
methods,
all
of
which
in
the
connection
like
the
present
one,
meaning
that
someone
like
mrs.
richardson,
as
i
say,
not
only
has
to
assess
her
own
conduct,
but
has
got
to
make
an
assessment
of
somebody
else's
conduct,
and
action
and
speech.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
yes,
it
can
be
and
i
think
it
is
in
this
oath,
although
it
is
particularly
the
words
“oppose
the
overthrow”
with
which
we
find
fault
in
this
oath,
not
the
word
“defend”.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
no,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
very
briefly,
in
making
our
brief,
i
would
make
today,
two
other
arguments.
one
i
have
i
think
touched
on
essentially
the
vagueness
argument
and
the
difficulty.
for
example,
in
a
situation
where
mrs.
richardson
or
any
other
employees
of
the
state,
were
to
sit
in
by
militants
of
the
state
house
in
massachusetts
or
at
the
federal
courthouse
or
the
federal
building
in
boston
which
just
happened
frequently
in
the
years
passed.
is
this
an
attempted
overthrow?
how
does
she
know?
is
she
required
the
act?
is
she
required
to
go
and
get
a
policeman?
just
what
is
she
supposed
to
do?
i
think
the
vagueness
problems
are
clear
enough
to
need,
i
hope
not
for
just
the
exposition.
final
point
is
that
the
statute
violates
due
process
as
the
connell
case
construed
in
last
term
and
that
provides
for
no
hearing
for
mrs.
richardson
or
any
other
employee
show,
why
she
refuses
to
take
the
oath.
no
opportunity
to
make
a
record
to
show
that
she
is
merely
a,
let
us
say
a
scrupulous
conscientious
woman
who
feels
because
the
vagueness
and
overbreadth
problem
in
this
oath
that
she
cannot
in
good
conscious
take
it.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
the
particular
problem
of
--
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
no
hearing.
i
do
not
think
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
the
only
provisions
in
the
oath
are
those
finally
open
it.
it
does
say
in
the
first
sentence,
“i
do
solemnly
swear
or
affirm.”
mr.
stephen
h.
oleskey
no,
it
could
be
an
affirmance
rather
than
a
swearing,
nonetheless
as
i
see
it
that
double
penalty
under
the
massachusetts
statute,
both
for
prosecuting
for
perjury
which
section
14
explicitly
refers
to,
and
under
section
15
of
the
same
chapter
264
for
violation
of
the
terms
of
the
oath,
whatever
that
may
be,
still
remain.
thank
you.
