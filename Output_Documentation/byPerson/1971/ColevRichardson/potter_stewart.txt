justice
potter
stewart
you
said
that
this
is
required
to
all
employees.
the
fact
is
that
it
is
not
required
of
all
state
employees
because
physicians
or
nurses
in
a
hospital
or
other
health
care
institutions,
are
not
required
to
take
such
an
oath
if
there
(inaudible).
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
even
if
an
equal
protection
argument,
based
on
that
exception?
justice
potter
stewart
you
do
not?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
mayo,
i
did
not
demean
in
my
question
to
ask
you,
if
you
are
making
that
equal
protection
argument
on
that,
do
you
understand
that
your
brother
on
the
other
side
makes
one?
justice
potter
stewart
they
declare
to
you
that
the
phrase
“by
force,
violence
or
by
any
illegal
or
unconstitutional
method”
modifies
or
overthrow
rather
than
oppose.
as
a
matter
of
pure
grammar,
you
can
read
this
is
the
same
as
“he
will
oppose
the
overthrow
and
he
will
oppose
it
by
force,
violence
or
by
any
illegal
or
unconstitutional
method?”
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
matter
of
grammar
which
you
read
it,
it
could
be
read
the
other
way.
he
has
an
obligation
to
oppose
the
overthrow
by
force,
by
violence
or
by
any
illegal
or
unconstitutional
method,
any
way
just
to
oppose
the
overthrow
of
the
government?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
it
is
not
your
--
it
is
not
the
thrust
of
your
argument
mr.
mayo
that
the
vice
of
this
oath
lies
in
its
vagueness,
unconstitutional
vagueness?
i
thought
it
was.
justice
potter
stewart
then,
i
do
not
understand
your
answer
to
my
brother
white’s
question?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
quite,
purely
in
personal
terms.
it
is
not
put
at
all
in
associational
or
membership
terms,
just
as
the
first
part
of
the
oath
is
put,
purely
in
personal
terms
and
in
the
future
tense?
justice
potter
stewart
but,
you
say
there
are
some
cases
holding
that?
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
your
theory
for
that.
i
think
it
seems
to
me
quite
more
appealing
from
the
words
of
this
particular
oath?
justice
potter
stewart
what
she
will
do
in
the
future?
justice
potter
stewart
she
personally
will
do?
justice
potter
stewart
what
do
you
suggest,
what
language
would
you
suggest
that
might
meet
your
standards
of
clarity
and
lack
of
vagueness
and
lack
of
broadness?
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
“uphold
and
defend,”
do
you
think
those
words
have
any
more
precise
meaning
than
the
word
“oppose,”
“uphold
and
defend?”
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
is
not
in
this?
justice
potter
stewart
but
is
this
a
matter
of
words?
do
you
think
the
words
uphold
and
defend
or
uphold
or
defend
have
more
definitive
and
precise
content
than
the
word
oppose?
well,
there
are
antonyms,
but
it
is
one
more
precise
than
the
other?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
i
thought
you
told
us
would
be
very,
very
constitutionally
invalidated,
if
you
are
inquiring
about
somebody’s
beliefs.
this
is
not
doing
that.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
certainly
is
not
the
only
vague
provision
of
the
constitution,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
a
provision,
either
explicit
or
implicit,
that
under
the
statute
for
somebody
who
objects
to
take
an
oath
generally
to
affirm
rather
than
to
take
an
oath?
justice
potter
stewart
or
affirm,
so
that
is
not
an
issue
in
the
case?

you
