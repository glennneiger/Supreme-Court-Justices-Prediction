justice
byron
r.
white
how
does
it
work?
it
is
perfectly
clear
here
in
the
first
part
of
the
oath,
the
oath
reads
“to
obey
the
oath,”
you
have
purposely
to
speak
out
against
“violent
overthrow”
that
one
have
and
secondly
physically
to
oppose
by
an
overthrow,
suppose
those
things
are
stated
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
either
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
it
would
not
require
anymore
than
one
of
those
things
or
close
to
those
two
things,
would
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
more
could
it
mean
in
those
two
things?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
that
is
i
mentioned
would
be
one
end
of
the
scale
and
one
on
the
other,
is
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
were
a
constitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
argue
those
vagueness
(voice
overlap)?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
“oppose”
as
declared
in
their
report,
i
mean,
is
it
anymore
vague
in
the
clause?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
“support”
though,
in
the
first
part?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
is
that
“oppose”
anymore
vague
than
“support”
which
is
not
constitutionally
vague?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
oleskey,
you
said
that
(inaudible)
required
to
take
an
oath
that
“i
oppose,”
would
that
be
contrary
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
massachusetts
will
be
enforcing
would
no
longer
be
the
oath
required
by
section
14,
but
a
different
oath?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
guess,
what
they
are
really
saying
is
that
the
injunction
is
vague?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
does
not
involve
(inaudible)
“oppose”
is
a
different
word?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
are
--
if
it
is
just
an
oath
that
says
“i
will
defend
the
constitution,”
you
have
no
vague
problems
with
that
at
this
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
you
would
find
trouble
if
it
said,
“i
will
defend
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
against
all
enemies
and
against
this
overthrow
by
force
and
violence.”
justice
byron
r.
white
then
you
have
trouble
with
“defend”?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
really
it
is
the
context
in
which
the
word
“defend”
is
used?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
in
a
three-judge
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
hearing?
