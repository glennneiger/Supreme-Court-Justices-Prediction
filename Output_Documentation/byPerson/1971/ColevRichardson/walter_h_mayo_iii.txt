mr.
walter
h.
mayo,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
direct
appeal
from
the
decision
of
a
three-judge
district
court
for
the
district
of
massachusetts,
declaring
invalid
on
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
grounds,
the
oath
required
of
all
state,
county
and
municipal
employees
in
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts,
but
the
facts
are
not
in
dispute.
very
briefly
they
are
that
the
plaintiff
was
hired
as
a
research
sociologist
at
the
boston
state
hospital.
she
was
on
two
occasions
asked
to
take
the
oath
required
by
the
statute,
and
on
both
occasions
she
refused.
there
upon,
she
was
advised
that
she
could
no
longer
continue
her
employment
at
the
hospital
and
the
compensation
could
no
longer
be
paid
to
her.
several
months
later,
plaintiff
commenced
her
civil
action
in
the
district
court
in
which
she
sought
a
declaration
as
to
the
oath’s
constitutionality
and
damages
by
way
of
back
pay
and
for
breach
of
contract.
the
three-judge
court
received
the
stipulation
of
facts
and
her
arguments
of
counsel
and
there
upon
entered
a
judgment
and
injunction
declaring
that
the
oath
did
violate
the
provisions
of
the
first
amendment
of
the
constitution,
but
they
denied
the
plaintiff's
claim
for
damages
and
back
pay.
both
the
plaintiffs
and
the
defendants
appealed
to
this
court
in
the
1969
term,
and
in
response
to
the
defendant’s
appeal,
the
plaintiff
maintains
that
that
appeal
was
moot
because
of
a
particular
job
slot
for
which
she
had
been
hired
at
the
boston
state
hospital
had
been
filled
subsequent
to
the
district
court’s
decision.
the
defendants
resisted
this
suggestion
of
mootness
by
filing
an
affidavit
of
the
hospital
superintendent,
but
nevertheless
this
court
vacated
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
and
remanded
to
that
court
with
directions
to
determine
the
question
of
mootness.
at
the
hearing
on
remand
before
the
district
court,
the
three-judge
court
received
an
additional
stipulation
of
facts,
and
heard
oral
evidence
on
the
question
of
damages
which
it
had
advised
that
it
would
reconsider
and
at
that
hearing,
the
plaintiff
retracted
her
suggestion
of
mootness
which
had
been
made
earlier
to
this
court
on
the
preceding
appeal.
there
upon,
the
three-judge
court
reinstated
its
judgment
and
injunction
continuing
to
deny
the
plaintiff,
a
claim
for
damages
and
back
pay.
now,
this
time
only,
the
defendant’s
appeal,
this
court
has
noted
probable
jurisdiction
and
we
are
therefore
here
on
the
narrow
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
may
require
all
of
its
public
employees
an
oath
that
they
swear
or
affirm
that
they
will
uphold
and
defend
the
constitution
of
united
states
and
of
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts,
and
further
they
will
oppose
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
or
of
the
commonwealth
by
force,
violence
or
any
illegal
or
unconstitutional
method.
mr.
walter
h.
mayo,
iii
no,
mr.
justice.
yes,
it
is
mr.
justice
blackmun,
it
is
no
longer
in
the
case.
mr.
walter
h.
mayo,
iii
well,
the
district
court
did
not
mentioned
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
its
original
opinion
on
the
constitutionality
issue
and
based
it
entirely
on
the
first
amendment
and
i
believe
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
first
amendment
is
applicable
to
the
states
or
the
fourteenth,
we
must
also
characterize
it
as
being
a
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
question.
mr.
walter
h.
mayo,
iii
yes,
excuse
me
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
is
correct
provision,
exception
is
written
in
the
statute.
mr.
walter
h.
mayo,
iii
no,
no
equal
protection
argument.
mr.
walter
h.
mayo,
iii
no.
plaintiff’s
challenge
in
the
district
court
was
first
to
the
entire
oath
and
the
district
court
considered
this
challenge
and
found
plaintiff’s
analysis
of
the
language
of
the
first
portion
of
the
oath
that
one
will
uphold
and
defend
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
commonwealth
to
be
esoteric.
it
said
that
they
could
not
adopt
that
argument
because
any
argument
after
that
portion
of
the
oath,
had
been
foreclosed
by
this
court
for
carrying
an
affirmance
in
knight
versus
board
of
regents.
as
to
the
second
portion
of
the
oath,
the
district
court
agreed
to
plaintiff
in
one
respect.
it
observed
first
that
plaintiff’s
argument,
as
to
this
point
is
equally
esoteric,
which
if
the
court
would
follow
it,
would
make
almost
any
sentence
in
the
english
language
ambiguous.
however,
the
court
went
on
to
find
the
phrase
“oppose
the
overthrow”
fairly
vague
because
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
word
‘oppose’
had
at
least
two
common
meanings,
and
it
therefore
concluded
the
first
amendment
was
violated
in
this
respect.
although,
the
district
court
did
not
suggest
in
its
opinion
just
how
plaintiff’s
rights
under
that
amendment
were
infringed.
now,
it
is
the
defendant’s
position
in
this
court
that
the
oath
survives
all
constitutional
tests.
first
it
is
not
void
for
vagueness
and
its
provisions
are
easily
understood
and
are
intelligible
and
further
even
assuming
for
the
purposes
of
argument
that
there
are
some
ambiguities
in
the
oath,
but
the
oath
is
not
thereby
invalidated
because
its
provisions
do
not
affect
or
infringe
any
of
the
plaintiff’s
first
amendment
rights.
as
to
vagueness,
we
believe
that
the
oath
as
a
whole
should
be
examined
to
determine
what
meaning
is
reasonably
conveyed
by
it.
the
oath
should
not
be
separated
word
by
word
and
examined
under
microscope.
mr.
walter
h.
mayo,
iii
no,
i
do
not
believe
so
mr.
justice
stewart.
viewing
the
oath
as
a
whole,
we
think
that
it
is
a
promissory
oath
of
the
constitutional
support
which
requires
action
in
the
future.
the
portion
which
requires
“one
to
oppose
the
overthrow”
as
a
corollary
of
the
first
portion
which
requires
one
to
support
and
defend
the
federal
and
state
constitutions.
but
the
support
to
constitutions
is
at
the
same
time
to
oppose
the
overthrow
the
constitutions.
the
second
portion
therefore
clarifies
the
first
portion
and
delaying
the
employees'
obligation
under
it
and
the
second
portion
can
also
be
said
to
test
whether
the
first
portion
of
the
oath
is
taken
without
mental
reservation
or
for
purpose
of
the
reservation.
mr.
walter
h.
mayo,
iii
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
walter
h.
mayo,
iii
and
we
would
maintain
the
second
portion
of
the
oath
likewise.
there
is
no
question
to
belief
which
entered
into
the
determination
on
this
point,
but
there
is
certainly
no
question
with
beliefs
in
the
first
portion
of
the
oath.
now,
whatever
maybe
the
contention
is
on
the
vagueness
question,
and
even
assuming
those
questions
to
be
colorable
as
with
mr.
justice
harlan
when
the
case
was
here
on
the
prior
appeal,
we
think
that
on
the
examination
of
the
effect
of
the
oath
on
first
amendment
freedom
dispels
any
doubt
that
any
of
the
plaintiff’s
freedoms
under
the
first
amendment
are
infringed
by
the
oath.
first
of
all,
the
oath
is
far
different
from
those
oaths
which
had
been
struck
down
by
this
court
in
baggett,
and
in
elfbrandt,
and
cramp.
now,
the
oaths
in
those
cases
required
specific
disclaimers
of
affiliation
with
so
called
subversive
organizations,
and
the
instant
oath
has
no
such
thing.
in
our
view,
it
is
a
forward-looking
promissory
oath
of
constitutional
support
that
does
not
require
a
statement
of
belief
which
is
a
crucial
distinction
between
this
case
and
the
connell
case
decided
by
this
court
last
term.
no
statement
as
to
one’s
belief
at
the
time
he
is
asked
to
take
the
oath
is
required.
the
oath
does
not
describe
freedom
of
association,
for
an
employee
is
free
to
join
whatever
organizations
or
political
parties
he
desires.
the
oath
does
not
prohibit
membership
in
any
organization
or
political
party,
nor
does
the
oath
infringe
on
anyone’s
religious
beliefs
or
associations.
for
instance,
if
an
employee
is
prohibited
by
reason
of
his
religious
group
(inaudible),
he
might
qualify
the
oath
in
that
regard
and
i
might
add
that
such
a
qualification
was
approved
by
the
attorney
general
of
massachusetts
in
1967,
in
this
respect.
in
short,
we
think
that
none
of
the
plaintiff’s
first
amendment
rights
are
infringed
by
this
oath.
now,
plaintiff
attacks
in
this
case
things
and
the
names
to
be
concentrated
on
very
speculative
and
conjectural
possibilities
concerning
speech
and
association
in
the
event
of
a
possible
overthrow
of
the
government.
mr.
walter
h.
mayo,
iii
no,
i
think
mr.
justice
stewart
the
language
modifies
the
word
“overthrow”
and
not
the
word
“oppose.”
it
is
the
“overthrow
by
force,
violence
or
any
illegal
or
unconstitutional
method.”
mr.
walter
h.
mayo,
iii
no,
i
could
not
agree,
as
the
rule
of
grammar,
that
it
would
modify
the
word
“oppose”
because
i
do
not
think
that
an
employee
would
use
any
illegal
or
unconstitutional
method
to
oppose
the
overthrow.
i
do
not
believe
that
would
be
permitted.
now,
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
does
not
believe
that
remote
conjecture
can
suffice
to
invalidate
the
oath
on
constitutional
grounds.
now,
what
is
required
in
this
case
to
reach
such
a
determination
is
a
readily
apparent
constitutional
infirmity.
in
other
words,
it
must
be
clear
beyond
third
dementia
that
the
oath
will
restrict
the
plaintiff’s
first
amendment
freedom
and
a
precise
identification
of
those
freedoms
must
be
made.
the
court
must
be
able
to
say
that
the
inhibiting
effect
on
speech
or
association
is
real
and
not
illusory
and
we
submit
that
such
an
inhibiting
effect
cannot
be
gleaned
from
the
extremely
remote
possibilities
as
to
what
plaintiff
maybe
required
to
say
or
do
in
the
future.
now,
plaintiff
goes
on
to
argue
that
the
due
process
clause
invalidates
the
oath
because
it
requires
a
summary
dismissal
without
a
hearing,
cited
in
the
connell
case
decided
in
the
last
term.
again,
the
crucial
distinction
between
the
two
cases,
is
that
floyd
which
was
considered
by
this
court
in
connell
contains
the
word
“believe,”
i
do
not
believe
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government.
and
the
opinion
of
this
court
required
floyd
to
hold
a
hearing
ascertaining
suppose
whether
the
beliefs
are
are
firmly
held
prior
to
a
final
discharge
of
the
employee.
in
the
case
at
bar
there
is
no
necessity
for
such
a
hearing
because
there
is
no
factual
inquiry
to
be
made
since
the
oath
involves
only
promises
of
future
action,
a
hearing
in
this
regard
would
be
meaningless.
either
a
person
takes
the
oath
or
he
does
not
and
such
a
determination
can
easily
be
reached
without
a
hearing.
in
this
case,
i
would
note,
that
the
court
is
confronted
with
a
record
that
it
is
absolutely
barren
of
any
threat
of
prosecution
to
perjury
or
any
hint
that
plaintiff
would
be
discharged
for
a
failure
to
live
up
to
the
terms
of
the
oath,
and
in
fact
since
the
oath
was
enacted
in
1949,
no
prosecutions
have
resulted
and
no
public
employee
has
been
discharged
for
failure
to
perform
his
obligations
under
the
oath,
and
therefore,
we
think
that
plaintiff
is
here
as
to
the
infringement
of
her
first
amendment
rights,
under
the
circumstances
are
simply
without
foundation.
we
think
that
the
case
can
be
succinctly
summarized
in
the
words
of
mr.
justice
harlan
who
said
when
the
case
was
here
on
the
earlier
appeal
subscribing
to
the
oath’s
objectiveness
to
mrs.
richardson
to
no
more
than
an
amenity.
the
defendants
would
ask
that
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
be
vacated,
this
case
be
remanded
for
that
court,
with
direction
to
dismiss
the
complaint.
mr.
walter
h.
mayo,
iii
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not
have
rebuttal.
mr.
walter

mayo,

this
court
for
carrying
an
affirmance
in
knight
versus
board
of
regents.
as
to
the
second
portion
of
the
oath,
the
district
court
agreed
to
plaintiff
in
one
respect.
it
observed
first
that
plaintiff’s
argument,
as
to
this
point
is
equally
esoteric,
which
if
the
court
would
follow
it,
would
make
almost
any
sentence
in
the
english
language
ambiguous.
however,
the
court
went
on
to
find
the
phrase
“oppose
the
overthrow”
fairly
vague
because
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
word
‘oppose’
had
at
least
two
common
meanings,
and
it
therefore
concluded
the
first
amendment
was
violated
in
this
respect.
although,
the
district
court
did
not
suggest
in
its
opinion
just
how
plaintiff’s
rights
under
that
amendment
were
infringed.
now,
it
is
the
defendant’s
position
in
this
court
that
the
oath
survives
all
constitutional
tests.
first
it
is
not
void
for
vagueness
and
its
provisions
are
easily
understood
and
are
intelligible
and
further
even
assuming
for
the
purposes
of
argument
that
there
are
some
ambiguities
in
the
oath,
but
the
oath
is
not
thereby
invalidated
because
its
provisions
do
not
affect
or
infringe
any
of
the
plaintiff’s
first
amendment
rights.
as
to
vagueness,
we
believe
that
the
oath
as
a
whole
should
be
examined
to
determine
what
meaning
is
reasonably
conveyed
by
it.
the
oath
should
not
be
separated
word
by
word
and
examined
under
microscope.
mr.
walter
h.
mayo,
iii
no,
i
do
not
believe
so
mr.
justice
stewart.
viewing
the
oath
as
a
whole,
we
think
that
it
is
a
promissory
oath
of
the
constitutional
support
which
requires
action
in
the
future.
the
portion
which
requires
“one
to
oppose
the
overthrow”
as
a
corollary
of
the
first
portion
which
requires
one
to
support
and
defend
the
federal
and
state
constitutions.
but
the
support
to
constitutions
is
at
the
same
time
to
oppose
the
overthrow
the
constitutions.
the
second
portion
therefore
clarifies
the
first
portion
and
delaying
the
employees'
obligation
under
it
and
the
second
portion
can
also
be
said
to
test
whether
the
first
portion
of
the
oath
is
taken
without
mental
reservation
or
for
purpose
of
the
reservation.
mr.
walter
h.
mayo,
iii
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
walter
h.
mayo,
iii
and
we
would
maintain
the
second
portion
of
the
oath
likewise.
there
is
no
question
to
belief
which
entered
into
the
determination
on
this
point,
but
there
is
certainly
no
question
with
beliefs
in
the
first
portion
of
the
oath.
now,
whatever
maybe
the
contention
is
on
the
vagueness
question,
and
even
assuming
those
questions
to
be
colorable
as
with
mr.
justice
harlan
when
the
case
was
here
on
the
prior
appeal,
we
think
that
on
the
examination
of
the
effect
of
the
oath
on
first
amendment
freedom
dispels
any
doubt
that
any
of
the
plaintiff’s
freedoms
under
the
first
amendment
are
infringed
by
the
oath.
first
of
all,
the
oath
is
far
different
from
those
oaths
which
had
been
struck
down
by
this
court
in
baggett,
and
in
elfbrandt,
and
cramp.
now,
the
oaths
in
those
cases
required
specific
disclaimers
of
affiliation
with
so
called
subversive
organizations,
and
the
instant
oath
has
no
such
thing.
in
our
view,
it
is
a
forward-looking
promissory
oath
of
constitutional
support
that
does
not
require
a
statement
of
belief
which
is
a
crucial
distinction
between
this
case
and
the
connell
case
decided
by
this
court
last
term.
no
statement
as
to
one’s
belief
at
the
time
he
is
asked
to
take
the
oath
is
required.
the
oath
does
not
describe
freedom
of
association,
for
an
employee
is
free
to
join
whatever
organizations
or
political
parties
he
desires.
the
oath
does
not
prohibit
membership
in
any
organization
or
political
party,
nor
does
the
oath
infringe
on
anyone’s
religious
beliefs
or
associations.
for
instance,
if
an
employee
is
prohibited
by
reason
of
his
religious
group
(inaudible),
he
might
qualify
the
oath
in
that
regard
and
i
might
add
that
such
a
qualification
was
approved
by
the
attorney
general
of
massachusetts
in
1967,
in
this
respect.
in
short,
we
think
that
none
of
the
plaintiff’s
first
amendment
rights
are
infringed
by
this
oath.
now,
plaintiff
attacks
in
this
case
things
and
the
names
to
be
concentrated
on
very
speculative
and
conjectural
possibilities
concerning
speech
and
association
in
the
event
of
a
possible
overthrow
of
the
government.
mr.
walter
h.
mayo,
iii
no,
i
think
mr.
justice
stewart
the
language
modifies
the
word
“overthrow”
and
not
the
word
“oppose.”
it
is
the
“overthrow
by
force,
violence
or
any
illegal
or
unconstitutional
method.”
mr.
walter
h.
mayo,
iii
no,
i
could
not
agree,
as
the
rule
of
grammar,
that
it
would
modify
the
word
“oppose”
because
i
do
not
think
that
an
employee
would
use
any
illegal
or
unconstitutional
method
to
oppose
the
overthrow.
i
do
not
believe
that
would
be
permitted.
now,
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
does
not
believe
that
remote
conjecture
can
suffice
to
invalidate
the
oath
on
constitutional
grounds.
now,
what
is
required
in
this
case
to
reach
such
a
determination
is
a
readily
apparent
constitutional
infirmity.
in
other
words,
it
must
be
clear
beyond
third
dementia
that
the
oath
will
restrict
the
plaintiff’s
first
amendment
freedom
and
a
precise
identification
of
those
freedoms
must
be
made.
the
court
must
be
able
to
say
that
the
inhibiting
effect
on
speech
or
association
is
real
and
not
illusory
and
we
submit
that
such
an
inhibiting
effect
cannot
be
gleaned
from
the
extremely
remote
possibilities
as
to
what
plaintiff
maybe
required
to
say
or
do
in
the
future.
now,
plaintiff
goes
on
to
argue
that
the
due
process
clause
invalidates
the
oath
because
it
requires
a
summary
dismissal
without
a
hearing,
cited
in
the
connell
case
decided
in
the
last
term.
again,
the
crucial
distinction
between
the
two
cases,
is
that
floyd
which
was
considered
by
this
court
in
connell
contains
the
word
“believe,”
i
do
not
believe
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government.
and
the
opinion
of
this
court
required
floyd
to
hold
a
hearing
ascertaining
suppose
whether
the
beliefs
are
are
firmly
held
prior
to
a
final
discharge
of
the
employee.
in
the
case
at
bar
there
is
no
necessity
for
such
a
hearing
because
there
is
no
factual
inquiry
to
be
made
since
the
oath
involves
only
promises
of
future
action,
a
hearing
in
this
regard
would
be
meaningless.
either
a
person
takes
the
oath
or
he
does
not
and
such
a
determination
can
easily
be
reached
without
a
hearing.
in
this
case,
i
would
note,
that
the
court
is
confronted
with
a
record
that
it
is
absolutely
barren
of
any
threat
of
prosecution
to
perjury
or
any
hint
that
plaintiff
would
be
discharged
for
a
failure
to
live
up
to
the
terms
of
the
oath,
and
in
fact
since
the
oath
was
enacted
in
1949,
no
prosecutions
have
resulted
and
no
public
employee
has
been
discharged
for
failure
to
perform
his
obligations
under
the
oath,
and
therefore,
we
think
that
plaintiff
is
here
as
to
the
infringement
of
her
first
amendment
rights,
under
the
circumstances
are
simply
without
foundation.
we
think
that
the
case
can
be
succinctly
summarized
in
the
words
of
mr.
justice
harlan
who
said
when
the
case
was
here
on
the
earlier
appeal
subscribing
to
the
oath’s
objectiveness
to
mrs.
richardson
to
no
more
than
an
amenity.
the
defendants
would
ask
that
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
be
vacated,
this
case
be
remanded
for
that
court,
with
direction
to
dismiss
the
complaint.
mr.
walter
h.
mayo,
iii
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not
have
rebuttal.
