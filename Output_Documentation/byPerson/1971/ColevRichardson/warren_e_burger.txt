chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
cole
against
richardson.
mr.
mayo,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
ask
you
mr.
mayo,
under
this
oath
as
it
is
traced
with
reference
to
defending,
a
person
could
have
a
private
belief,
philosophical
and
political
belief
of
communism
and
still
conscientiously
take
this
oath
to
defend
against
those
to
overthrow
the
government,
could
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
in
that
part
of
the
oath,
it
is
not
a
case
involving
belief.
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
mayo.
mr.
oleskey?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
agree
mr.
oleskey
with
the
response
that
mr.
mayo
gave
to
my
hypothetical
question,
perhaps
not
hypothetical,
that
a
person
could
be
a
philosophical
believer
in
communism
and
yet
take
the
oath,
that
he
would
conscientiously
takes
the
oath
that
he
would
oppose
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
the
force,
violence
and
so
forth?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
think
he
might
not
be
a
very
conscientious
communist,
perhaps?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
does
that
second
part
of
the
oath
deal
with
belief
per
se
or
does
it
deal
with
the
plaintiff
with
respect
to
future
conduct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
future
conduct,
is
it
not
rather
than
intent?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
see
much
distinction
between
the
oath,
the
first
part
of
the
oath
before
the
conjunctive
and,
and
the
oath
that
you
took
for
example
when
you
were
admitted
to
the
bar
of
this
court.
i
think
the
language
almost
tracks
(voice
overlap)
the
oath
here,
it
does
not
include
state
of
massachusetts
of
course?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
i
suppose
that
in
terms
of
the
oath
that
you
will
take
three-days
hence
or
thereafter,
you
heard
the
oath
in
this
courtroom
of
course?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
think
it
is
essentially
the
same
as
the
first
part
of
the
oath
if
you
take
out
massachusetts.
so
moving
to
just
the
second,
the
second
is
really
a
conduct,
it
is
a
future
conduct,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
back
on
the
same
theory,
i
suppose
that
lawyers,
i
disagree
with
an
opinion
of
a
court
and
yet
as
the
officers
of
the
court
be
bound
to
uphold
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
speaking
now
the
second
part?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
after
the
oath?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think,
it
is
usually
separable
in
this
context
when
they
are
divided
or
separated
by
“and?”
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
there
is
any
impediment
to
a
court
amending
the
oath?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
try
another
one
on
you
then
mr.
oleskey.
what
would
you
think
of
the
oath
that
“i
do
solemnly
swear
that
as
an
attorney
and
a
counselor
of
this
court,
i
will
conduct
myself
uprightly
and
according
to
law
and
that
i
will
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
do
you
think
that
is
any
less
vague
than
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
language
“i
will
conduct
myself
uprightly.”
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
this
doctor
--
your
client
were
required
to
take
that
oath,
would
you
have
any
trouble
with
it?(voice

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
advise
her
that
there
was
any
difficulty
about
taking
that
oath
“conduct
yourself
uprightly”
as
a
physician,
a
surgeon
or
whatever
she
may
be?
chief

warren
e.

justice
blackmun
was
reading
the
oath
that
the
constitution
requires
of
president
of
the
united

to
take
as
you
perhaps
recognize?
chief

warren
e.

you.
mr.
