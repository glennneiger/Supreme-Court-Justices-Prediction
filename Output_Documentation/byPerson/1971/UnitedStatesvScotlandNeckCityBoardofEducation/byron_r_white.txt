justice
byron
r.
white
with
the
same
historical
contextual
environment
that
this
case
actually
has?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
the
question
before
the
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
assume
that
was
known
to
the
school
district
here
at
all
before,
but
in
the
process
of
drafting
a
remedy
the
district
court
had
or
had
simply
said
that
there
would
be
an
attendance
district
in
exactly
the
same
shape
as
scotland
neck.
now
why
would
have
that
been
improper?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
aren't
proposing
any
general
rule
however
that
in
no
circumstances
when
a
county
is
adopting
a
desegregation
plan,
where
the
county
is
80%
black,
20%
white,
that
there
never
could
be
under
such
a
plan,
a
school
attendance
zone
with
50-50
white
and
black.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
just
the
particular
facts
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
or
it's
scotland
neck?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
mr.
wallace,
am
i
correct
that
many
years
ago
scotland
neck
was
a
separate
district.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
have
a
historical
fact
here
which
is
not
often
present.
suppose
it
never
had
been
enveloped
into
the
county
system,
would
your
case
be
different
today?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
feel
it
would
be
a
different
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
need
for
you
to
prevail,
do
we
have
to
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
on
whether
the
legislature
had
any
knowledge
or
considered
the
transfer
plan.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
effective
figure
though,
90%
figure,
is
as
adequate
for
your
arguments,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
court
of
appeals
has
found
against
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
where
when
the
court
of
appeals
is
found
contrary
to
what
you're
telling
us.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
joyner,
i
am
interested
in
what
you
think
about
this.
let's
assume
for
the
moment
for
the
moment
that
all
of
this
county
had
been
either
all
black
or
all
white,
or
at
least
so
much
one
way
or
the
other
that
really
wouldn't
make
much
a
difference,
would
scotland
neck
still
have
made
itself
into
a
separate
school
district
because
of
the
desire
of
quality
education
in
the
sense
that
by
making
itself
a
separate
school
district,
it
could
ensure
that
more
money
would
be
spent
on
the
schools
than
if
it
were
a
part
of
the
county.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
north
carolina,
after
scotland
neck
becomes
a
city,
does
it
remain
subject
to
the
county
schools
act,
does
the
property
in
the
city
remains
subject
to
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
that,
from
here
on
scotland
neck
wouldn't
be
very
enthusiastic
about
raising
--
if
the
scotland
neck
plan
were
adopted,
and
there
was
a
separate
school
district
there,
scotland
neck
wouldn't
be
too
enthusiastic
about
raising
the
overall
county
tax
rates
for
schools,
because
as
long
as
the
scotland
neck
property
remains
subject
to
tax
ratio.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
tell
just
now
the
county
school
board
is
also
elected?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
many
members
--
the
board
of
county
commissioners
are
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
have
got
that
bond
issue
proposals
in
the
last
20
years?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
the
two
major
cities
that
you're
talking
about
is
controlling
50%
of
the
votes?
i
take
it
the
bond
issues
must
have
been
defeated
in
those
cities
or
they
would
have
carried.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
about
the
school?
is
the
school
tax,
a
separate
item
on
the
tax
bill?
i
mean,
does
it
take
separately,
does
the
school
board
certify
to
the
county
commissioners
a
certain
assessment?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
commissioners
don't
have
the
--
maybe
they
have
the
power,
but
effectively,
it's
the
school
board
that
sets
the
tax
ratio?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
don't
listen
to
the
school
board
as
to
how
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know
how
much
money
per
pupil
is
spent?
let's
say
in
the
major
cities
that
you're
talking
about
the
two.
do
you
know
how
much
per
pupil
is
spent?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
substantially
more
than
per
pupil
outside?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
people
in
those
two
cities
affected
themselves
with
school
with
a
higher
rate
than
the
people
in
county?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
would
be
an
addition
to
this
county
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
comparable
to
the
extra
rate
in
the
other
two
--
in
the
other
major
cities?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
scotland
neck
is
going
to
do
do
with
school
of
the
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
what's
the
capacity
--
the
schools
have
approximately?
justice
byron
r.
white
without
the
transfer
plan.
without
how
many
students
are
going
to
be
in
a--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
with
the
transfer
plan,
how
many
1000?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
transfer
plan
has
been
stricken
down.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
whites
who
were
going
to
come
in
or
anybody
else
who
want
to
come
in
won't
be
coming
in--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
will
your
50
cents
--
i
suppose
you
had
planned
on
1000
students?
justice
byron
r.
white
say
five
out
of
1000
students
and
if
it
takes
50
cents
to
run
the
school
with
1000
students,
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
only
700?
is
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
but
you
were
going
to
charge
for
the--
justice

you're
