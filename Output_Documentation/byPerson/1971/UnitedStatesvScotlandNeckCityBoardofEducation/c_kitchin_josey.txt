mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
first
like
to
refer
to
the
question
that
mr.
justice
white
adverted
to
concerning
the
tax
structure
in
the
effect
if
the
scotland
neck
bill
was
found
constitutional.
the
tax
is
levied
uniformly
throughout
the
county
on
ad
valorem
basis.
then
each
separate
school
unit,
a
manipulated
unit,
it
assigned
that
portion
or
that
county-based
tax
on
a
per
pupil
ratio.
now
in
addition,
each
separate
school
district,
and
i
think
this
is
true
throughout
the
country.
in
most
cases,
have
an
additional
or
supplementary
tax,
which
they
themselves
levy
and
which
they
themselves
receive.
so
therefore,
separate
units,
separate
administrative
units,
can
and
do
get
a
supplementary
tax
plus,
by
law
must
get
that
--
per
pupil
basis
of
the
county
tax.
now
that's
one
of
the
problems
that
this
school
in
scotland
neck
face
from
the
very
beginning
from
1936
until
date.
they
did
not
receive
their
per
pupil
ratio
of
a
county
tax.
that
was
one
of
the
problems.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
because
they
were
not
a
separate
unit,
they
were
part
of
the
county
and
the
county
school
board,
once
they
--
the
county
school
system
gets
their
per
pupil
ratio
basis
of
the
county
fact,
then
of
course
and
this
is
proper.
the
school
board
can
spend
that
money
within
its
unit,
anyway
it
wants
to.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
oh
yeah,
because
and
of
course
in
the
early
days,
in
1936,
scotland
neck
had
prior
to
that
time
been
a
city
and
they
had
build
their
own
schools,
and
they
were
in
better
shape,
frankly,
than
the
schools
throughout
the
county
and
for
ten
years
or
fifteen
years
or
so,
those
funds
that
would
normally
have
gone
to
scotland
neck,
went
to
the
other
parts
of
the
county
and
we
raised
no
point
about
it.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
that's
part
of
it,
but
your
honor,
it
is
true
that
halifax
county
schools
as
a
whole
did
not
receive
an
adequate
amount.
we
first
admit
that.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
i'm
not
sure.
there
is
no
procedure
that
i
know
of
to
make
them
--
tax
that
people
like
they
should.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
don't
think
so,
and
i'm
not
sure
that,
that
would
be
the
proper
--
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
well,
i
think
over
a
period
of
time
we
maybe
able
to
bring
a
lawsuit
and
enforce
and
make
them
give
us
at
least
more
than
we've
gotten.
however
--
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
it
has,
it
has.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
well,
i
think
we
could
have,
i
don't
believe
that--
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
well,
of
course,
the
reason
i
have
seen
that
they
went
into
the
city
--
went
out
of
the
city
system
because
during
the
depression,
we
just
didn't
have
--
we
couldn't
levy
that
supplementary
tax
and
we
fell
back
into
the
county
system.
in
fact,
many
units
did
throughout
the
state,
because
of
the
overall
state
law
that
permitted
them
to
go
into
the
county
system
unless
they
requested
to
stay
out,
and
this,
of
course,
has
been
the
problem.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
classrooms
in
scotland
neck,
the
main
classroom
building,
one
was
built
in
1903
and
the
other
was
built
in
1923.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
two-fold,
that
is
fundamental,
the
first.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
that's
correct.
we
were
a
very
small
part
of
county.
county
is
approximately
55,0000
in
population
and
we
are
approximately
3000.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
well,
of
course,
i
think
we
would
and
i
think
we
have
shown
in
our
--
in
the
facts
of
this
case
that
we
would
be
interested
because
we
would
not--
you'd
be
getting
back
more
of
the
county.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
well,
we'd
be
getting
our
share.
our
per
pupil
ratio
which
we
never
got.
now,
the
other
question
i
think
that
came
up
with
mr.
joyner
was
did
we,
in
fact,
would
we
have,
had
it
not
been
for
integration
and
the
post-integration,
have
asked
for
city
separate
unit.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
this
case,
and
in
the
facts
of
this
case,
it
is
shown
that
in
1965,
and
as
early
as
1963
the
plan
were
laid
for
separate
units.
in
the
legislature
of
north
carolina
in
1965,
and
this
was,
of
course,
before
green
and
this
was
the
time
when
there
was
admittedly
no
integration
of
the
schools
there
and
no
thought
that
it
would
have
to
be
integrated.
we
went
to
the
legislature
and
entered
instant
bill
and
it
passed
the
highest
and
the
senator
--
and
this
is
in
the
record.
it
was
felt
very
strongly
that
the
ruled
residents
in
the
vicinity
of
scotland
neck,
defeated
that
bill
because
they
didn't
want
to
raise
their
tax.
the
people
in
scotland
neck
have
been
fighting
this
problem,
certainly
for
many
years.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
i
certainly
think
that's
true,
it's
--
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
it
certainly
is
true
in
our
area,
i've
been
a
school
board
attorney
for
some
time
and
for
instance
in
the
1957
county
school
bond
election,
the
only
school
bond
election
that's
passed
in
halifax
county,
since
1936.
the
school
board
people
and
the
leaders
in
the
whole
county,
after
vigorous
campaign
by
the
school
authority,
this
bond
issue
passed
with
a
scant
county-wide
majority
of
388
votes
county-wide.
in
general,
the
rural
area
of
the
country
voted
against
this
bond
issue,
and
this
is
appendix
933.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
yes.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
that's
correct.
they
do
not
and
of
course
as
i've
explained
to
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
think,
they
have
to
do
that
because
after
all
some
places
in
the
county,
and
no
doubt,
and
i
think
this
is
true,
mr.
justice
marshall
in
our
county
there's
no
question
that
in
1936,
1940,
1945,
maybe
1950,
the
negro
schools
were
in
horrible
condition
and
i
am
convinced
that
most
of
the
money
certainly
in
those
early
days,
went
for
the
improvement
of
negro
schools.
they
were
hold
in
the
(inaudible)
there
had
been
considerable
improvements.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
well,
in
the
first
10
years,
15
years,
the
people
of
scotland
neck
moved
in,
and
the
people
of
scotland
neck
did
not
complain
and
i'm
confident
that
that's
the
reason
and
basically,
no
lawsuit
was
filed,
but
this
thing
kept
up
over
30
years.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
they
are
elected
by
county-wide
vote,
and
this
is
another
problem,
your
honor.
there
are
two
city
systems
in
our
county
already,
the
city
of
roanoke
rapids
which
is
much
larger
than
any
other
city,
the
city
of
weldon
in
surrounding
area
has
a
city
system
and
those
two
city
systems
together,
basically
have
50%
of
the
votes
in
the
whole
county.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
no
sir,
wilson
is
in
wilson
county,
which
is
adjacent
to
us.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
they
do
and
that's
very
unfortunate,
but
they,
you
see,
can
swing
and
they
do
swing
the
vote
to
the
country
board
of
education
members
up
in
that
area
was
other
than
the
county.
we
have
--
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
it
is.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
there
are
no
physical
districts,
this
has
been
traditional
as
to
generally
where
they
run
from,
but
there
is
no
district,
it's
state
wide,
it's
a
county-wide
vote.
we
have
had
one
member
on
that
board
out
of
five
or
six
or
seven
member
board,
seven
member,
i
believe,
since
1936
and
one
member
out
of
seven
or
eight
just
does
not
have
the
power
to
accomplish
what
--
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
no,
we
might
--
when
you
say
the
board
of
supervisors,
i
assume
you
mean
the
county
commissioner?
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
yes,
that's
county
commissioner
and
when
you
said
board
of
supervisors,
i
didn't
quite
appreciate
that.
ours
is
called
county
commissioner
and
i
assume
you
said
that.
those
are
elected
by
districts
on
a
population
basis,
but
you
see
we're
in
a
end
of
a
county
that
is
of
course
partially
populated
and
we
do
have
one
member
board
of
county
commissioners.
he
doesn't
enter
scotland
neck,
he
goes
out
far
more
outside
and
there
again
you
see,
the
rule,
he's
following
up
and
he's
the
one
who's
going
to
stop
the
practice.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
it's
elected,
yes,
the
county-wide,
but
not
by
district.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
yes.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
well,
they
are
five.
they
just
changed
this
past
legislature
to
six
which
weighted
it
and
again
in
the
populous
area
from
their
own
apparatus.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
there
have,
and
the
only
one
that
passed
was
the
1957
bond
issue.
there
have
been
others
but
they
have
been
defeated.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
when
those
two
cities
and
those
two
systems,
particularly
roanoke
rapids,
when
it
gets
ready
for
some
money
on
a
bond
issue,
then
we
are
going
to
be
able
to
pass
it.
if
they
say
no,
they
are
not
ready
for
it
and
after
all
they
are
getting
a
supplementary.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
oh,
no,
it's
county
commissioners
and
there
the
county
commissioner
sets
the
rate
–
sets
the
budget.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
well,
they
listen,
but
how
much
attention
they
pay
to
them
mr.
justice
white,
is
very
problematical.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
county
commissioners,
immediately
after
the
1957
bond
issue,
instead
of
leaving
a
capital
outlay,
school
tax
rate
at
60
cents
on
the
100.
instead
of
doing
that,
which
they
had
promised
the
school
board
they
were
going
to
do,
they
reduced
it
down
to
27
cents
and
it's
never
gotten
back
up.
it's
up
to
29
cents
since
then.
so
it's
less
than
half
of
what
it
was
in
1956,
because
of
the
school
bond
issue,
and
in
that
issue
--
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
we
have
those
figures
and
they
are
somewhere
in
--
i'm
not
sure
about
the
average.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
there's
no
question
about
it.
there's
no
question
about
the
cities,
but
more
in
the
education
than
the
rural
areas.
that's
i
am
sure
true
throughout
--
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
there's
no
question
about
it,
yes
sir.
you
see,
this
bill,
that
is
now
before
this
court,
levies
a
50
cents
per
100
on
proper
evaluation
in
the
city
of
scotland
neck,
that's
the
highest
percentage
about
north
carolina
law
that
scotland
neck
--
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
yes,
would
be
an
addition
to
county
tax.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
it's
more
than
any
of
the
other
two
cities.
it's
more
than
any
--
in
the
1957
bond
issue,
even
though
scotland
neck
voted
for
it
and
had
almost
half
of
the
total
county
majority,
if
scotland
neck
had
been
a
separate
unit
that
time,
it
would
have
gotten
$190,000
that
is
based
on
the
per
pupil
ratio.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
not
$1
of
those
funds
were
ever
spent
in
the
time
of
scotland
neck,
not
$1.
then
in
1963,
there
was
a
state
bond
issue,
and
that's
the
only
state
bond
issue,
(inaudible)
state
bond
issue.
the
halifax
county
schools
got
approximately
$1
million.
not
$1
of
this
money
was
ever
spent
in
the
time
of
scotland
neck.
of
course
at
that
time
the
people
began,
as
mr.
justice
marshall
suggested,
to
get
disappointed
and
upset
and
they
then
in
1963,
drew
up
a
bill
and
they
introduced
in
the
legislature.
the
people
had
a
long
fight
with
their
schools.
they
made
every
effort
to
upgrade
their
schools.
they
have
certainly
not
been
--
i'm
not
saying
that
they
were
real
happy
with
the
brown
decision.
i'm
not
saying
that
they
were
happy
with
the
green
decision,
but
the
time
of
scotland
neck
and
its
citizens,
and
i
think
it's
abundant
evidence
to
that
effect.
certainly,
we're
willing
to
face
that
problem
realistically.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
well,
if
your
honor,
please,
that
balance
schools
in
the
state
of
north
carolina
that
are
approximately
of
the
similar
size,
who
in
accordance
with
alll
rankings,
and
this
was
part
of
the
record
are
in
the
top,
in
the
state.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
halifax
county
school
is
a
160
out
of
a
160
unit,
is
the
bottom
in
the
whole
state.
the
number
of
students
that
go
onto
college,
that's
just
one
indication
of
the
academic
rating
of
the
schools
of
halifax
county
is
a
160
out
of
160.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
approximately
750,
approximately
same
amount
that
we
have
proposed
with
the
students.
over
700
--
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
approximately
700.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
well,
with
the
transfer
plan,
a
1000.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
it's
been
stricken.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
i'm
sure,
that's
true.
there
would
be
a
very
limited
amount
of
transfer.
now
the
district
court
in
its
opinions
stated
that
it
would
have
no
difficultly
with
this
transfer
that
it
could
and
it
proposed
two
or
three
different
possibilities.
one;
to
let
one
black
one
white
come
in.
in
other
words
keep
the
balance.
but
i
don't
know
that
the
transfer
plan
is
necessary
at
all,
it's
just
walk
them
in,
walk
them
out.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
i
assume
that--
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
well,
that
would
be
that
much
more
per
pupil.
in
other
words,
we
weren't
going
to
get
but--
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
well,
that
charge
would
certainly
not
take
care
of
the--
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
we'll
have
more
per
pupil,
that's
correct.
on
summary,
which
we
contend
describes
attitudes
and
the
hopes
of
the
people
of
the
time
of
scotland
neck
is
candidly
expressed
in
the
deposition
of
frank
shields
chairman
of
the
scotland
neck's
city
board
of
education
and
answer
to
the
question
propounded
by
the
government's
attorney.
i'd
like
to
quote
him.
that's
appendix,
page
436.
“i
think
that
the
people
of
scotland
neck,
both
negro
and
white
are
moderates.
in
my
talking
to
people
they
have
felt
that
integration
was
inevitable.
i
would
have
to
say
that
the
thinking
of,
i
don't
like
the
word
progressive
but
the
people
that
really
consider
problems
ahead
of
their
actual
taking
place,
they
felt
like
we
ought
to
be
making
some
preparation
for
the
two
races
attending
the
same
school.
i
have
personally
felt
that
when
you
involve
something
as
large
as
this
county,
that
there's
going
to
be
a
lot
of
rough
road
ahead.
now
we
have
not
had
any
demonstrations
here.
we
have
not
had
any
board
cuts
here.
as
far
as
i
know,
there
has
been
no
friction
between
the
two
races.
but
i
cannot
say
that
about
any
other
community
in
halifax
county
and
i
personally
have
felt
that
if
folks
right
down
here
that
go
ahead
and
integrate
and
get
it
over
and
get
on
back
to
education
that
is
it
would
be
effort
well
spent.
i
was
aware
of
and
was
in
agreement
with
mr.
harrision
when
he
asked
for
an
integrated
high
school
down
here,
and
that
was
in
1966
before
agreement.
i
felt
and
i
wasn't
by
myself.
there
were
others
that
felt,
well,
in
this
way
we
can
go
ahead,
we
will
be
right.
we
can
go
ahead
with
education.
so,
i
am
sure
that
in
our
discussion,
and
i
felt
like
this
was,
we
had
tried
every
method
that
i
knew
of
to
try
within
the
county,
to
try
to
go
ahead
and
in
this
end
of
the
county,
i
am
not
talking
about
independently,
but
for
us
to
go
ahead
and
move
on
into
integration,
i
felt
like
this
setting
up
this
school
system
would
bring
us
in
compliance
with
the
law
and
we
could
go
ahead
without
interrupting
“education”.”
we
contend
that
the
two
judge
district
court,
after
several
days
observing
this
type
of
witness,
and
after
sharply
questioning
them
personally
concluded
that
the
scotland
neck
city
system
could
and
would
be
operated
in
a
completely
nondiscriminatory
manner
and
for
the
betterment
of
the
education
of
its
students.
in
its
findings
of
fact,
“the
halifax
county
school
superintendent
as
saying
that
the
interim
plan
which
the
court
eventually
ordered,
could
still
be
implemented
if
the
constitutionality
of
the
scotland
neck
district
was
upheld.
that
halifax
county
would
still
get
the
same
amount
of
money
per
pupil
from
the
state
and
from
local
sources
in
the
county
and
that
the
county
would
have
an
even
better
pupil
teacher
ratio
in
certain
areas
of
instructions”.
the
court
further
added,
“if
the
school
district
itself
were
found
to
be
constitutional,
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
fashion
an
acceptable
transfer
plan
by
either
limiting
transfers
in
and
out
sets
that
the
black-white
ratio
would
be
the
same
after
accepting
transfer
or
by
accepting
an
equal
number
of
blacks
and
whites”.
we
earnestly
contend
--
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
no,
this
would
not
be
voluntary,
there
would
be
no
transfer
overall
except
by
the
district
court,
and
i
assume
that
we
have
agreed
in
our
answer
that
whatever
plan
that
we
would
have
a
transfer
would
be
submitted
to
the
court.
here
the
case
one
possibility
would
be
--
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
it's
not
voluntary
on
our
part,
we
--
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
no,
this
would
definitely
not
be
a
free
transfer
plan,
your
honor,
as
i
said
and
it
would
be
whatever
the
court
demanded
or
required
in
accordance
with
the
decisions
that
this
court
has
set
down.
i'm
not
sure
what
it
would
be
and
i'm
not
sure
that
the
district
court
knows
yet.
but
we
honestly
contend
--
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
we
earnestly
contend
that
the
north
carolina
legislature
and
the
public
school
leaders
of
community
of
scotland
neck,
have
presented
a
plan
which
will
best
accomplish
in
a
realistic
manner,
the
letter
and
spirit
of
the
mandate
to
dismantle
the
remaining
vestiges
of
law
imposed
segregation,
root
and
branch
and
will
at
the
same
time
improve
the
quality
of
education,
what
more
does
the
law
demand
of
its
citizenship.
thank
you.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
first
like
to
refer
to
the
question
that
mr.
justice
white
adverted
to
concerning
the
tax
structure
in
the
effect
if
the
scotland
neck
bill
was
found
constitutional.
the
tax
is
levied
uniformly
throughout
the
county
on
ad
valorem
basis.
then
each
separate
school
unit,
a
manipulated
unit,
it
assigned
that
portion
or
that
county-based
tax
on
a
per
pupil
ratio.
now
in
addition,
each
separate
school
district,
and
i
think
this
is
true
throughout
the
country.
in
most
cases,
have
an
additional
or
supplementary
tax,
which
they
themselves
levy
and
which
they
themselves
receive.
so
therefore,
separate
units,
separate
administrative
units,
can
and
do
get
a
supplementary
tax
plus,
by
law
must
get
that
--
per
pupil
basis
of
the
county
tax.
now
that's
one
of
the
problems
that
this
school
in
scotland
neck
face
from
the
very
beginning
from
1936
until
date.
they
did
not
receive
their
per
pupil
ratio
of
a
county
tax.
that
was
one
of
the
problems.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
because
they
were
not
a
separate
unit,
they
were
part
of
the
county
and
the
county
school
board,
once
they
--
the
county
school
system
gets
their
per
pupil
ratio
basis
of
the
county
fact,
then
of
course
and
this
is
proper.
the
school
board
can
spend
that
money
within
its
unit,
anyway
it
wants
to.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
oh
yeah,
because
and
of
course
in
the
early
days,
in
1936,
scotland
neck
had
prior
to
that
time
been
a
city
and
they
had
build
their
own
schools,
and
they
were
in
better
shape,
frankly,
than
the
schools
throughout
the
county
and
for
ten
years
or
fifteen
years
or
so,
those
funds
that
would
normally
have
gone
to
scotland
neck,
went
to
the
other
parts
of
the
county
and
we
raised
no
point
about
it.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
that's
part
of
it,
but
your
honor,
it
is
true
that
halifax
county
schools
as
a
whole
did
not
receive
an
adequate
amount.
we
first
admit
that.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
i'm
not
sure.
there
is
no
procedure
that
i
know
of
to
make
them
--
tax
that
people
like
they
should.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
don't
think
so,
and
i'm
not
sure
that,
that
would
be
the
proper
--
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
well,
i
think
over
a
period
of
time
we
maybe
able
to
bring
a
lawsuit
and
enforce
and
make
them
give
us
at
least
more
than
we've
gotten.
however
--
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
it
has,
it
has.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
well,
i
think
we
could
have,
i
don't
believe
that--
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
well,
of
course,
the
reason
i
have
seen
that
they
went
into
the
city
--
went
out
of
the
city
system
because
during
the
depression,
we
just
didn't
have
--
we
couldn't
levy
that
supplementary
tax
and
we
fell
back
into
the
county
system.
in
fact,
many
units
did
throughout
the
state,
because
of
the
overall
state
law
that
permitted
them
to
go
into
the
county
system
unless
they
requested
to
stay
out,
and
this,
of
course,
has
been
the
problem.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
classrooms
in
scotland
neck,
the
main
classroom
building,
one
was
built
in
1903
and
the
other
was
built
in
1923.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
two-fold,
that
is
fundamental,
the
first.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
that's
correct.
we
were
a
very
small
part
of
county.
county
is
approximately
55,0000
in
population
and
we
are
approximately
3000.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
well,
of
course,
i
think
we
would
and
i
think
we
have
shown
in
our
--
in
the
facts
of
this
case
that
we
would
be
interested
because
we
would
not--
you'd
be
getting
back
more
of
the
county.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
well,
we'd
be
getting
our
share.
our
per
pupil
ratio
which
we
never
got.
now,
the
other
question
i
think
that
came
up
with
mr.
joyner
was
did
we,
in
fact,
would
we
have,
had
it
not
been
for
integration
and
the
post-integration,
have
asked
for
city
separate
unit.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
this
case,
and
in
the
facts
of
this
case,
it
is
shown
that
in
1965,
and
as
early
as
1963
the
plan
were
laid
for
separate
units.
in
the
legislature
of
north
carolina
in
1965,
and
this
was,
of
course,
before
green
and
this
was
the
time
when
there
was
admittedly
no
integration
of
the
schools
there
and
no
thought
that
it
would
have
to
be
integrated.
we
went
to
the
legislature
and
entered
instant
bill
and
it
passed
the
highest
and
the
senator
--
and
this
is
in
the
record.
it
was
felt
very
strongly
that
the
ruled
residents
in
the
vicinity
of
scotland
neck,
defeated
that
bill
because
they
didn't
want
to
raise
their
tax.
the
people
in
scotland
neck
have
been
fighting
this
problem,
certainly
for
many
years.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
i
certainly
think
that's
true,
it's
--
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
it
certainly
is
true
in
our
area,
i've
been
a
school
board
attorney
for
some
time
and
for
instance
in
the
1957
county
school
bond
election,
the
only
school
bond
election
that's
passed
in
halifax
county,
since
1936.
the
school
board
people
and
the
leaders
in
the
whole
county,
after
vigorous
campaign
by
the
school
authority,
this
bond
issue
passed
with
a
scant
county-wide
majority
of
388
votes
county-wide.
in
general,
the
rural
area
of
the
country
voted
against
this
bond
issue,
and
this
is
appendix
933.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
yes.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
that's
correct.
they
do
not
and
of
course
as
i've
explained
to
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
think,
they
have
to
do
that
because
after
all
some
places
in
the
county,
and
no
doubt,
and
i
think
this
is
true,
mr.
justice
marshall
in
our
county
there's
no
question
that
in
1936,
1940,
1945,
maybe
1950,
the
negro
schools
were
in
horrible
condition
and
i
am
convinced
that
most
of
the
money
certainly
in
those
early
days,
went
for
the
improvement
of
negro
schools.
they
were
hold
in
the
(inaudible)
there
had
been
considerable
improvements.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
well,
in
the
first
10
years,
15
years,
the
people
of
scotland
neck
moved
in,
and
the
people
of
scotland
neck
did
not
complain
and
i'm
confident
that
that's
the
reason
and
basically,
no
lawsuit
was
filed,
but
this
thing
kept
up
over
30
years.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
they
are
elected
by
county-wide
vote,
and
this
is
another
problem,
your
honor.
there
are
two
city
systems
in
our
county
already,
the
city
of
roanoke
rapids
which
is
much
larger
than
any
other
city,
the
city
of
weldon
in
surrounding
area
has
a
city
system
and
those
two
city
systems
together,
basically
have
50%
of
the
votes
in
the
whole
county.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
no
sir,
wilson
is
in
wilson
county,
which
is
adjacent
to
us.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
they
do
and
that's
very
unfortunate,
but
they,
you
see,
can
swing
and
they
do
swing
the
vote
to
the
country
board
of
education
members
up
in
that
area
was
other
than
the
county.
we
have
--
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
it
is.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
there
are
no
physical
districts,
this
has
been
traditional
as
to
generally
where
they
run
from,
but
there
is
no
district,
it's
state
wide,
it's
a
county-wide
vote.
we
have
had
one
member
on
that
board
out
of
five
or
six
or
seven
member
board,
seven
member,
i
believe,
since
1936
and
one
member
out
of
seven
or
eight
just
does
not
have
the
power
to
accomplish
what
--
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
no,
we
might
--
when
you
say
the
board
of
supervisors,
i
assume
you
mean
the
county
commissioner?
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
yes,
that's
county
commissioner
and
when
you
said
board
of
supervisors,
i
didn't
quite
appreciate
that.
ours
is
called
county
commissioner
and
i
assume
you
said
that.
those
are
elected
by
districts
on
a
population
basis,
but
you
see
we're
in
a
end
of
a
county
that
is
of
course
partially
populated
and
we
do
have
one
member
board
of
county
commissioners.
he
doesn't
enter
scotland
neck,
he
goes
out
far
more
outside
and
there
again
you
see,
the
rule,
he's
following
up
and
he's
the
one
who's
going
to
stop
the
practice.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
it's
elected,
yes,
the
county-wide,
but
not
by
district.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
yes.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
well,
they
are
five.
they
just
changed
this
past
legislature
to
six
which
weighted
it
and
again
in
the
populous
area
from
their
own
apparatus.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
there
have,
and
the
only
one
that
passed
was
the
1957
bond
issue.
there
have
been
others
but
they
have
been
defeated.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
when
those
two
cities
and
those
two
systems,
particularly
roanoke
rapids,
when
it
gets
ready
for
some
money
on
a
bond
issue,
then
we
are
going
to
be
able
to
pass
it.
if
they
say
no,
they
are
not
ready
for
it
and
after
all
they
are
getting
a
supplementary.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
oh,
no,
it's
county
commissioners
and
there
the
county
commissioner
sets
the
rate
–
sets
the
budget.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
well,
they
listen,
but
how
much
attention
they
pay
to
them
mr.
justice
white,
is
very
problematical.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
county
commissioners,
immediately
after
the
1957
bond
issue,
instead
of
leaving
a
capital
outlay,
school
tax
rate
at
60
cents
on
the
100.
instead
of
doing
that,
which
they
had
promised
the
school
board
they
were
going
to
do,
they
reduced
it
down
to
27
cents
and
it's
never
gotten
back
up.
it's
up
to
29
cents
since
then.
so
it's
less
than
half
of
what
it
was
in
1956,
because
of
the
school
bond
issue,
and
in
that
issue
--
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
we
have
those
figures
and
they
are
somewhere
in
--
i'm
not
sure
about
the
average.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
there's
no
question
about
it.
there's
no
question
about
the
cities,
but
more
in
the
education
than
the
rural
areas.
that's
i
am
sure
true
throughout
--
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
there's
no
question
about
it,
yes
sir.
you
see,
this
bill,
that
is
now
before
this
court,
levies
a
50
cents
per
100
on
proper
evaluation
in
the
city
of
scotland
neck,
that's
the
highest
percentage
about
north
carolina
law
that
scotland
neck
--
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
yes,
would
be
an
addition
to
county
tax.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
it's
more
than
any
of
the
other
two
cities.
it's
more
than
any
--
in
the
1957
bond
issue,
even
though
scotland
neck
voted
for
it
and
had
almost
half
of
the
total
county
majority,
if
scotland
neck
had
been
a
separate
unit
that
time,
it
would
have
gotten
$190,000
that
is
based
on
the
per
pupil
ratio.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
not
$1
of
those
funds
were
ever
spent
in
the
time
of
scotland
neck,
not
$1.
then
in
1963,
there
was
a
state
bond
issue,
and
that's
the
only
state
bond
issue,
(inaudible)
state
bond
issue.
the
halifax
county
schools
got
approximately
$1
million.
not
$1
of
this
money
was
ever
spent
in
the
time
of
scotland
neck.
of
course
at
that
time
the
people
began,
as
mr.
justice
marshall
suggested,
to
get
disappointed
and
upset
and
they
then
in
1963,
drew
up
a
bill
and
they
introduced
in
the
legislature.
the
people
had
a
long
fight
with
their
schools.
they
made
every
effort
to
upgrade
their
schools.
they
have
certainly
not
been
--
i'm
not
saying
that
they
were
real
happy
with
the
brown
decision.
i'm
not
saying
that
they
were
happy
with
the
green
decision,
but
the
time
of
scotland
neck
and
its
citizens,
and
i
think
it's
abundant
evidence
to
that
effect.
certainly,
we're
willing
to
face
that
problem
realistically.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
well,
if
your
honor,
please,
that
balance
schools
in
the
state
of
north
carolina
that
are
approximately
of
the
similar
size,
who
in
accordance
with
alll
rankings,
and
this
was
part
of
the
record
are
in
the
top,
in
the
state.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
halifax
county
school
is
a
160
out
of
a
160
unit,
is
the
bottom
in
the
whole
state.
the
number
of
students
that
go
onto
college,
that's
just
one
indication
of
the
academic
rating
of
the
schools
of
halifax
county
is
a
160
out
of
160.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
approximately
750,
approximately
same
amount
that
we
have
proposed
with
the
students.
over
700
--
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
approximately
700.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
well,
with
the
transfer
plan,
a
1000.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
it's
been
stricken.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
i'm
sure,
that's
true.
there
would
be
a
very
limited
amount
of
transfer.
now
the
district
court
in
its
opinions
stated
that
it
would
have
no
difficultly
with
this
transfer
that
it
could
and
it
proposed
two
or
three
different
possibilities.
one;
to
let
one
black
one
white
come
in.
in
other
words
keep
the
balance.
but
i
don't
know
that
the
transfer
plan
is
necessary
at
all,
it's
just
walk
them
in,
walk
them
out.
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
i
assume
that--
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
well,
that
would
be
that
much
more
per
pupil.
in
other
words,
we
weren't
going
to
get
but--
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
well,
that
charge
would
certainly
not
take
care
of
the--
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
we'll
have
more
per
pupil,
that's
correct.
on
summary,
which
we
contend
describes
attitudes
and
the
hopes
of
the
people
of
the
time
of
scotland
neck
is
candidly
expressed
in
the
deposition
of
frank
shields
chairman
of
the
scotland
neck's
city
board
of
education
and
answer
to
the
question
propounded
by
the
government's
attorney.
i'd
like
to
quote
him.
that's
appendix,
page
436.
“i
think
that
the
people
of
scotland
neck,
both
negro
and
white
are
moderates.
in
my
talking
to
people
they
have
felt
that
integration
was
inevitable.
i
would
have
to
say
that
the
thinking
of,
i
don't
like
the
word
progressive
but
the
people
that
really
consider
problems
ahead
of
their
actual
taking
place,
they
felt
like
we
ought
to
be
making
some
preparation
for
the
two
races
attending
the
same
school.
i
have
personally
felt
that
when
you
involve
something
as
large
as
this
county,
that
there's
going
to
be
a
lot
of
rough
road
ahead.
now
we
have
not
had
any
demonstrations
here.
we
have
not
had
any
board
cuts
here.
as
far
as
i
know,
there
has
been
no
friction
between
the
two
races.
but
i
cannot
say
that
about
any
other
community
in
halifax
county
and
i
personally
have
felt
that
if
folks
right
down
here
that
go
ahead
and
integrate
and
get
it
over
and
get
on
back
to
education
that
is
it
would
be
effort
well
spent.
i
was
aware
of
and
was
in
agreement
with
mr.
harrision
when
he
asked
for
an
integrated
high
school
down
here,
and
that
was
in
1966
before
agreement.
i
felt
and
i
wasn't
by
myself.
there
were
others
that
felt,
well,
in
this
way
we
can
go
ahead,
we
will
be
right.
we
can
go
ahead
with
education.
so,
i
am
sure
that
in
our
discussion,
and
i
felt
like
this
was,
we
had
tried
every
method
that
i
knew
of
to
try
within
the
county,
to
try
to
go
ahead
and
in
this
end
of
the
county,
i
am
not
talking
about
independently,
but
for
us
to
go
ahead
and
move
on
into
integration,
i
felt
like
this
setting
up
this
school
system
would
bring
us
in
compliance
with
the
law
and
we
could
go
ahead
without
interrupting
“education”.”
we
contend
that
the
two
judge
district
court,
after
several
days
observing
this
type
of
witness,
and
after
sharply
questioning
them
personally
concluded
that
the
scotland
neck
city
system
could
and
would
be
operated
in
a
completely
nondiscriminatory
manner
and
for
the
betterment
of
the
education
of
its
students.
in
its
findings
of
fact,
“the
halifax
county
school
superintendent
as
saying
that
the
interim
plan
which
the
court
eventually
ordered,
could
still
be
implemented
if
the
constitutionality
of
the
scotland
neck
district
was
upheld.
that
halifax
county
would
still
get
the
same
amount
of
money
per
pupil
from
the
state
and
from
local
sources
in
the
county
and
that
the
county
would
have
an
even
better
pupil
teacher
ratio
in
certain
areas
of
instructions”.
the
court
further
added,
“if
the
school
district
itself
were
found
to
be
constitutional,
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
fashion
an
acceptable
transfer
plan
by
either
limiting
transfers
in
and
out
sets
that
the
black-white
ratio
would
be
the
same
after
accepting
transfer
or
by
accepting
an
equal
number
of
blacks
and
whites”.
we
earnestly
contend
--
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
no,
this
would
not
be
voluntary,
there
would
be
no
transfer
overall
except
by
the
district
court,
and
i
assume
that
we
have
agreed
in
our
answer
that
whatever
plan
that
we
would
have
a
transfer
would
be
submitted
to
the
court.
here
the
case
one
possibility
would
be
--
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
it's
not
voluntary
on
our
part,
we
--
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
no,
this
would
definitely
not
be
a
free
transfer
plan,
your
honor,
as
i
said
and
it
would
be
whatever
the
court
demanded
or
required
in
accordance
with
the
decisions
that
this
court
has
set
down.
i'm
not
sure
what
it
would
be
and
i'm
not
sure
that
the
district
court
knows
yet.
but
we
honestly
contend
--
mr.
c.
kitchin
josey
we
earnestly
contend
that
the
north
carolina
legislature
and
the
public
school
leaders
of
community
of
scotland
neck,
have
presented
a
plan
which
will
best
accomplish
in
a
realistic
manner,
the
letter
and
spirit
of
the
mandate
to
dismantle
the
remaining
vestiges
of
law
imposed
segregation,
root
and
branch
and
will
at
the
same
time
improve
the
quality
of
education,
what
more
does
the
law
demand
of
its
citizenship.
thank
you.
