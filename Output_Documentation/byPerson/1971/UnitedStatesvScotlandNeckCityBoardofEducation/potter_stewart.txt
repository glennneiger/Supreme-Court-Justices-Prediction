the
halifax
county
school
district
at
that
time,
was
the
entire
county
with
the
exception
of
weldon
and
roanoke
rapids.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
--
what
is
it?
the
total
of
366,
i
am
talking
about
brawley,
brawley
was
9
white
children
and
350
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
total
of
888
and
what's
the
c-944?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
county
as
the
whole,
it's
about
--?
justice
potter
stewart
and
1%
percent
indian?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
mr.
wallace
if
in
the
mobile
case
those
had
been
two
separate
school
districts,
[voice
overlap]
the
result
would
have
been
quite
different?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
before
the
court
here
is
quite
a
different
problem.
justice
potter
stewart
am
i
correct
in
my
recollection
mr.
wallace
that
in
the
charlotte-mecklenburg
opinion
last
term,
we
said
that
the
danger
of
white
flight
is
something
that
a
district
court
could
quite
appropriately
recognize
and
try
to
prevent
in
its
desegregation
decree,
the
danger
of
resegregation,
which
is
what
white
flight
causes?
am
i
wrong?
i
just
don't
remember
it.
but
my
recollection
is
that
there
was
--
that
the
opinion
addressed
itself
to
that
problem.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
have
all
of
the
really
complicated
facts
in
last
year's
school
board
in
mind,
and
i
haven't
reread
it,
but
the
transfer
of
those
students
out
to
the
high
school
on
the
periphery
in
the
community
was
approved
by
this
court
as
an
appropriate
action
that
the
district
judge
took,
and
his
purpose
of
taking
that
action
was
to,
as
i
remember
it,
to
prevent
white
flight
which
leads
to
resegregation.
that's
what
resegregation
means,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
maybe
we
don't
agree
on
the
meaning
of
that
rather
new
word,
but
i
thought
that
it
was
a
word
that
described
a
phenomenon
i.e.
white
flight
and
the
result
of
white
flight.
justice
potter
stewart
specifically,
it's
the
impact
on
brawley,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
as
well
as
on
baker?
justice
potter
stewart
but
isn't
it
primarily?
and
you
were
talking
about
the
scotland
neck
area
that
would
be
brawley
primarily?
justice
potter
stewart
for
white
children?
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
be
the
only
school
in
the
county
would
it
not,
that
would
not
b
majority
negro?
justice
potter
stewart
and
to
do
what?
justice
potter
stewart
white
flight
in
this
case
would
not
have
been
a
move
to
the
suburbs
or
to
a
different
area,
who
would
have
been
sending
children
to
private
schools,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
why
didn't
they?
i
thought
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
than
lot
of
money
on
this
school
than
on
that.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
major
complaint
seems
to
be
that
the
county
was
not
collecting
enough
money,
taxation
to
run
into
the
school
system,
is
that
what
you
mean.
justice
potter
stewart
i
was
just
going
to
come
to
that
and
you
didn't
have
enough
remedy
to
propose?
justice
potter
stewart
how
is
the
board
of
supervisors
of
the
county
elected?
justice
potter
stewart
do
the
residents
of
those
two
cities
vote
for
the
county
board
of
supervisor
member?
justice
potter
stewart
is
county
schools
board
elected
by
popular
votes?
justice
potter
stewart
do
they
come
from
districts
or
from
the
county
at
large?
justice
potter
stewart
you
have
a
county-wide
vote
both
for
the
board
of
supervisors
and
the
school
board?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
thinking
about
the
--
whatever
party
it
is
that
levies
the
tax?
justice
