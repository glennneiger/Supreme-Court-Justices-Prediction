mr.
adam
stein
yes,
sir.
mr.
adam
stein
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
petitioners
in
70-187
pattie
black
cotton
and
others
who
intervened
these
plaintiffs
in
the
district
court.
they
are
black
children
and
their
parents
who
had
traditionally
attended
the
brawley
school,
and
are
the
children
who
are
most
immediately
affected
in
terms
of
their
constitutional
rights.
we
think
that
what
is
most
important
about
this
case,
is
the
facts
and
we
agree
with
the
government
that
the
most
important
facts
in
the
case
are
those
which
show
the
impact
of
chapter
31
in
the
scotland
neck
area.
the
map
behind
me
is
an
enlargement
of
the
map
referred
to
before
at
page
12b
of
the
appendix
which
shows
that
impact.
mr.
adam
stein
it's
the
impact
on
brawley
--
mr.
adam
stein
as
well
as
on
all
the
formerly
black
schools
in
the
area.
under
segregation
--
mr.
adam
stein
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
under
segregation
the
scotland
neck
school
served
this
entire
area
for
grades
1
to
12.
mr.
adam
stein
for
white
children.
black
children
at
the
high
school
level
from
the
same
area
went
to
the
brawley
school.
the
other
four
schools
were
black
elementary
schools
feeding
into
the
brawley
school.
in
the
immediate
area
of
scotland
neck,
black
children
went
to
the
brawley
school.
in
that
situation
the
town
lines
of
scotland
neck
had
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
pupil
assignment.
therefore,
you
can
see
that
the
white
children
in
the
whole
area,
half
of
them,
about
400
came
into
town,
crossed
the
town
lines,
black
children
in
the
town
crossed
town
lines
to
go
to
the
brawley
school
located
just
across
the
town
boundary,
and
indeed
all
the
white
children
in
the
city,
in
the
elementary
grades
also
crossed
the
town
lines,
because
the
junior
high
school
campus
of
the
scotland
neck
school
was
located
just
outside
of
the
town
line
down
here
about
the
same
distance
from
the
main
campus
of
the
scotland
neck
school
as
the
brawley
school
is.
it
was
this
situation
which
the
state
department
of
public
instruction
in
its
plan
sought
remedy.
and
the
remedy
proposed
there
was
a
very
simple
neutral
kind
of
assignment
plan.
that
is
instead
of
having
two
high
schools
to
serve
exactly
the
same
area;
one
for
white
and
one
for
black,
and
both
of
them
too
small
under
state's
standards,
the
scotland
neck
school
traditionally
serving
300
white
children
and
the
brawley
school
traditionally
serving
about
600
children.
the
state
proposal
consolidated
those
schools.
so
the
plan
is
modified
such
that
all
of
the
children
in
this
area
which
was
then
designated
district
1
would
go
to
grades
10
through
12
at
the
scotland
neck
school,
children
in
grades
9
would
go
to
the
brawley
school,
and
the
elementary
children
would
be
assigned
according
to
neutral
attendance
zones
as
shown
on
the
map.
thus
there
is
an
impact
as
well
as
the
difference
between
what
would
happen
at
brawley
and
scotland
neck,
because
the
elementary
children
who
attend
schools
where
the
ratios
reflect
the
residential
patterns
of
the
outlying
areas
some
more
of
varying
ratio,
would
under
the
state
plan
go
to
high
school
at
schools
where
the
ratios
would
reflect
the
entire
area.
however,
if
chapter
31
is
implemented,
then
they
would
go
to
the
brawley
school,
a
school
which
was
traditionally
black
and
which
would
have
a
very
much
more
--
much
blacker
ratio
than
the
neighboring
scotland
neck.
if
we
would
think
that
if
there
were
pressures
towards
whites
flight
in
this
situation,
that
they
would
certainly
be
accentuated
on
those
white
children,
half
of
the
children
in
the
area
who
would
know
that
under
chapter
31
they
would
never
be
attending
the
traditionally
white
school.
i
pointed
out
that
the
boundary
lines
were
always
ignored
as
to
pupil
assignment.
we've
pointed
out
in
our
brief
that
indeed
the
boundary
lines
of
the
halifax
district
were
ignored
to
promote
segregation,
white,
black,
and
indian
children
regularly
crossing
the
halifax
county
lines.
now,
we
think
that
the
major
impact
of
chapter
31
can
be
seen
in
the
impact
on
the
brawley
school
and
on
the
scotland
neck
school.
the
white
and
black
school
are
clearly
identifiable
as
white
and
black
schools
after
chapter
31
is
implemented.
we
would
like
to
point
out
that
a
principal
feature
of
this
plan
of
the
secession
was
the
transfer
tuition
arrangement.
that
was
known
by
the
legislature,
that
was
publicly
expressed
in
the
newspaper,
representative
gregory
from
the
area
who
was
a
proponent
who
spoke
of
this
in
the
press.
there
was
no
secret
about
that
and
the
plan
was
to
collect
all
the
white
children
into
the
scotland
neck
school
and
that
in
fact
is
what
had
happened
when
this
case
came
on
for
preliminary
injunction
hearing
in
the
summer
of
1968.
something
like
98%
of
the
white
children
in
the
area
would
always
go
to
scotland
neck
school
were
again
going
to
go
to
the
scotland
neck
school.
so
the
plan
was
for
all
of
them.
without
the
transfer
it's
for
half
of
them,
but
the
impact
we
say
is
very
substantial.
nonetheless,
and
it's
particularly
substantial
in
terms
of
the
interest
of
my
clients
who
live
in
that
area.
mr.
adam
stein
no,
mr.
justice
white,
i
don't
think
that
that
needs
to
be
reached
but
that
was
a
--
mr.
adam
stein
we
certainly
think
so.
but
what
we
would
say
is
that
there
is
more.
i
mean,
there
are
more
facts
suggesting
--
mr.
adam
stein
well,
but
that
was
a
finding
contradicting,
a
finding
by
the
district
court
--
mr.
adam
stein
that's
right.
it
is.
and
i
would
point
out
that
the
unit
proposed
here
is
by
far
--
would
be
by
far
the
smallest
school
administrative
unit
in
the
state
of
north
carolina.
when
chapter
31
was
passed,
it
was
the
first
new
unit
to
be
created
since
1953,
and
since
1953,
there
has
been
a
great
movement
of
consolidation
of
units
in
the
state
serving
state
policies
which
hold
that
small
units
are
inefficient,
expensive
and
don't
produce
quality
education.
i
would
just
ask
the
court
to
take
a
look
at
the
maps
so
that
you
can
see
what
the
plan
looks
like
visually.
we
would
suggest
that
it
is
very
awkward
to
create
the
segregation
we
complain
of,
i.e.,
the
brawley
zone
looks
like
a
donut
surrounding
the
town
of
scotland
neck.
we
had
understood
that
awkwardness
and
inconvenience
might
be
appropriate
in
moving
towards
disestablishing
the
dual
system.
but
we
would
suggest
that
an
awkward
assignment
arrangement
is
certainly
inappropriate
where
that
promotes
continued
segregation.
in
conclusion,
i
would
say
that
we
think
as
the
united
states
has
argued,
that
this
case
is
controlled
by
the
decision
last
term
in
north
carolina
board
of
education
against
swann,
and
we
would
urge
reversal
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
affirmance
of
the
district
court's
injunction.
mr.
adam
stein
