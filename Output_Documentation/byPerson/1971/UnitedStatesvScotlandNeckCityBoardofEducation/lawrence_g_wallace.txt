mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
consolidated
case
and
the
next
case
to
be
argued
were
decided
together
by
the
court
of
appeals
by
the
fourth
circuit
sitting
embank
and
presents
similar
issues.
each
case
involves
a
predominantly
black,
predominantly
rural
school
district
which
has
been
operating
a
dual
system
of
racially
segregate
schools.
in
each
case,
instead
of
proceeding
to
desegregate
the
entire
district
as
the
unit
in
which
had
been
operating,
the
state
has
sought
to
split
the
district
in
two
by
carving
out
a
small,
more
white
and
more
urban
enclave
to
operate
as
a
separate
school
district.
in
the
present
case
involving
the
schools
of
halifax
county,
north
carolina,
the
united
states
filed
suit
alleging
that
the
splitting
of
the
district
unconstitutionally
impeded
the
disestablishment
of
the
dual
system
and
additional
plaintiffs
subsequently
intervened
that
are
now
before
the
court
in
the
companion
case
which
has
been
consolidated
with
ours.
the
next
case
to
be
heard
which
involves
the
schools
of
greensville
county,
virginia
was
brought
by
private
plaintiffs
and
the
united
states
did
not
participate
in
the
case
that
any
stage
of
the
proceedings
until
this
court
granted
certiorari.
the
united
states
has
now
filed
a
brief,
amicus
curiae
in
support
of
the
petitioners
in
that
case.
in
each
case,
the
split
off
was
held
unconstitutional
by
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
by
a
divided
vote.
our
position
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
applied
the
wrong
standard
and
reached
the
wrong
result
in
both
cases.
there
was
also
a
third
case
decided
on
the
same
day
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
which
that
court
by
a
differently
divided
vote
upheld
another
district
court
order
enjoining
another
similar
split
off
in
north
carolina
and
no
petition
for
certiorari
was
filed
in
that
case
and
it
is
not
before
this
court.
now,
the
facts
of
the
present
case
can
conveniently
be
summarized
by
reference
to
the
very
readable
foldout
maps
that
appear
in
this
large
size
appendix
filed
by
the
petitioners
in
the
companion
case,
in
the
consolidated
case.
if
the
court
please,
i’d
like
to
turn
first
to
the
map
at
page
4b,
which
is
a
map
of
halifax
county,
the
county
at
issue
here.
it’s
a
largely
rural
area
which
is
some
40
miles
across
at
its
widest
point.
scotland
neck
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
this
is
the
whole
county,
depicted
in
this
map
and
scotland
neck,
the
town
which
has
been
carved
out
by
this
new
legislation
appears
in
the
southeastern
portion
scotland
neck’s
school
is
labeled,
that
little
rectangle
around
scotland
neck’s
school
and
brawley
school
and
the
limits
of
the
town
of
scotland
neck
are
within
that
rectangle,
that
irregularly
shaped
figure
in
lighter
lines.
the
shaded
areas
in
the
northern
portion,
labeled,
well,
in
roanoke
rapids
are
two
separately
administered
school
districts,
each
of
which
is
several
times
more
populous
than
the
town
of
scotland
neck.
those
have
been
administered
a
separate
districts
right
along.
the
rest
of
the
county
has
been
operating
as
a
single
school
district
known
as
the
halifax
county
administrative
unit
and
scotland
neck
has
been
included
in
that
school
system
since
1936.
and
until
1965,
all
of
the
schools
in
that
county
system
were
completely
segregated
by
race.
in
1965,
a
freedom
of
choice
plan
was
instituted
but
very
little
desegregation
resulted
from
that,
for
example,
during
the
1968-1969
school
year,
the
last
one
under
unmodified
freedom
of
choice,
all
of
the
whites
students
still
attended
the
four
traditionally
white
schools
and
97%
of
the
black
students
attended
the
other
all-black
schools.
the
district
at
that
time
was
77%
black.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
entire
district
that
--
the
halifax
county
school
district.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct
your
honor.
that
is
the
latest
--
it’s
been
operating
since
1936.
and
at
that
time
also,
more
than
90%
of
the
students
in
that
county
system
were
transported
to
school
by
school
buses.
the
record
shows,
in
the
summer
of
19
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it’s
a
little
more
than
10,000
your
honor.
i
think
its
10,655
if
i
recall.
in
the
summer
of
1968,
shortly
after
the
grim
trilogy
of
decisions
in
this
court,
the
department
of
justice
notified
the
county
school
board
here
pursuant
to
the
1964
civil
rights
act
that
operation
of
its
schools
did
not
comply
with
constitutional
requirements.
negotiations
followed
between
the
department
and
the
board,
and
the
board
agreed
in
the
course
of
those
negotiations
to
adopt
the
plan
for
disestablishing
the
dual
system
to
be
effective
by
the
fall
of
1969
and
to
take
some
interim
steps
for
the
1968-1969
school
year
and
the
student
assignments
which
are
--
well,
the
great
assignments
reflected
on
this
map
reflect
that
interim
agreement
with
the
department
of
justice.
the
agreement
was
widely
publicized
in
the
local
press
and
because
of
this
agreement
the
government
did
not
file
suit
at
that
time.
in
the
meantime,
the
county
school
board
had
asked
the
north
carolina
department
of
public
instruction
to
determine
how
the
board
could
meet
its
desegregation
obligations
and
to
reprimand
an
organizational
plan
designed
for
the
best
possible
education
of
the
children
in
the
county
system.
and
the
department
during
1968
studied
the
county
system
and
in
september
of
that
year,
recommended
both
a
long
ranged
plan
involving
the
construction
of
two
new
high
schools
and
the
so-called
interim
plan
using
the
existing
facilities.
and
that
interim
plan
is
depicted
on
the
next
foldout
map
at
page
8b
of
this
appendix.
it
provided
for
assignments
on
the
basis
of
four
geographic
zones,
this
is
numbered
districts
divided
by
broken
lines
with
the
--
a
pairing
of
grades
between
some
of
the
schools
including
scotland
neck’s
school
and
brawley
school,
the
schools
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
town
of
scotland
neck,
less
than
a
mile
apart
from
each
other,
these
two
school
buildings.
under
this
interim
plan,
some
white
students
would
have
been
assigned
to
each
of
the
formerly
all-black
school
and
none
of
the
four
traditionally
white
schools
would
have
a
like
majority
assigned
to
it.
the
county
school
board
did
not
adopt
the
interim
plan
and
in
february
of
1969
it
also
repudiated
its
agreement
with
the
department
of
justice
to
come
forward
with
a
plan
for
disestablishing
the
system
by
that
fall
and
instead
voted
to
return
to
freedom
of
choice
as
the
assignment
method.
and
shortly
thereafter
in
march
of
1969,
the
north
carolina
legislature
enacted
a
local
law,
chapter
31
of
the
1969
session
laws
of
north
carolina,
providing
for
a
new
school
district
to
be
bounded
by
the
corporate
limits
of
the
town
of
scotland
neck.
and
for
a
supplemental
tax
assessment
to
finance
the
schools
there
upon
approval
by
the
towns
voters
who
did
approve
in
a
special
election
conducted
in
april
of
1969.
the
complaint
in
the
present
suit
was
then
filed
in
june.
if
implemented,
chapter
31
would
have
carved
out
of
the
county
system
which
had
10,655
students
as
i
mentioned,
a
small
enclave
in
which
695
resided.
of
this
695
students,
57%
were
white
and
43%
black
in
contrast
to
the
county
systems
overall
student
population
which
was
22%
white
and
77%
black,
1%
indian.
the
court
of
appeals
deemed
it
significant
that
the
removal
of
the
695
students
from
the
county
system
would
shift
the
overall
ratio
by
only
three
points
to
80%
black
and
19%
white.
but
this
seems
to
us
an
unrealistic
way
to
look
at
the
effect
of
chapter
31
because
it
is
a
pairing
from
the
map
before
us,
that
in
most
of
the
county,
districts
2,
3,
and
4,
there
would
be
no
effect
of
chapter
31
or
only
a
very
negligible
effect
and
the
chapter
31’s
impact
would
be
concentrated
in
district
1
and
in
that
district
would
touch
mostly
the
scotland
neck
and
brawley
schools.
and
that
impact
is
shown
on
the
next
map
that
appears
to
which
i
will
turn
tomorrow
when
the
argument
is
resumed.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
pointed
out
yesterday
that
with
a
dual
school
system
still
in
effect
in
halifax
county
in
1969,
15
years
after
brown,
the
county
turned
away
from
the
recommendations
of
the
state
department
of
public
instruction
and
from
its
agreement
with
the
department
of
justice
both
of
which
looked
toward
dis-establishment
of
that
dual
school
system
and
instead
through
chapter
31
of
the
1969
session
laws,
there
was
carved
out
a
small
separate
school
district
for
scotland
neck,
while
as
a
mathematical
matter,
the
removal
of
these
695
students
could
have
only
a
limited
effect
on
the
racial
percentages
for
the
county
system
as
whole,
the
effect
would
be
very
substantial
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
scotland
neck
and
i
was
about
to
turn
to
the
fold
out
math
in
this
large
sized
appendix
filed
by
the
petitioners
in
the
consolidated
case
at
page
12b
where
there
is
some
indication
of
what
the
effect
of
chapter
31's
implementation
would
be
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
scotland
neck
within
district
1
of
the
state's
interim
plan.
the
impact
particularly
is
on
the
student
assignments
to
the
scotland
neck
school
and
to
the
brawley
school.
the
two
grade
1
to
12
schools
that
have
been
conducted
by
this
county
system
less
than
one
mile
apart
from
each
other.
brawley
being
an
all
black
school
and
scotland
neck
the
traditionally
white
school.
the
assignment
figures
printed
on
this
map
were
compiled
by
the
county
board
of
education.
the
map
was
submitted
by
the
county
board
as
an
exhibit
to
a
motion
of
theirs.
and
if
chapter
31
had
been
implemented,
these
figures
show
that
brawley
school
would
be
more
than
90%
black
while
the
scotland
neck
school
would
be
57%
white
and
43%
black.
by
contrast
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
those
are
the
figures
for
bakers
school,
the
366.
brawley
figures
are
underneath
805
negro,
83
white.
so
more
than
90%
of
the
assigned
students.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
the
capacity
of
the
facility.
the
total
is
888.
well,
it's
slightly
less
than
90%,
i
am
sorry
i
am
mathematically
was
slightly
off
there.
but
close
to
90%
of
the
students
would
be
black
at
brawley
and
at
scotland
neck
it
would
be
57%
white
and
43%
black.
by
contrast,
under
the
interim
plan,
which
the
state
department
of
public
instruction
had
recommended,
the
assignments
to
brawley
would
be
slightly
less
than
70%
black
and
those
to
scotland
neck
more
than
66%
black,
a
very
similar
ratio.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
77%
black,
22%
white.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
correct
your
honor.
and
there
was
also
a
transfer
plan
adapted
by
the
scotland
neck
city
board
of
education,
but
struck
down
as
unconstitutional
by
the
court
of
appeals
which
would
have
increased
the
disparity
under
chapter
31
even
more
on
the
basis
of
the
first
application
filed.
the
scotland
neck
school
would
have
gone
up
to
74%
white.
the
chapter
31
has
not
gone
into
effect,
because
the
court
of
appeals
stayed
its
mandate
pending
this
court's
decision
and
the
schools
are
now
operating
under
a
modified
version
of
the
state's
interim
plan
which
we
have
described
in
some
detail
on
page
14
of
our
brief
in
footnote
25.
now
the
vice
of
chapter
31
as
we
see
it,
is
very
similar
to
the
vice
of
the
north
carolina
anti-busing
law
struck
down
by
this
court
last
term
in
north
carolina
board
of
education
against
swann.
chapter
31
would
substantially
impair,
would
be
an
obstacle
to
disestablishment
of
the
dual
school
system
in
the
scotland
neck
brawley
area
of
this
county
school
system.
it
would
fence
off
most
of
the
black
students
in
that
area
from
the
traditionally
white
only
scotland
neck
school
and
would
fence
off
most
of
the
whites
in
that
area
from
the
nearby
formerly
all
black
brawley
school.
as
the
district
court
said,
its
effect
would
be
to
create
a
refuge
from
desegregation
for
white
students
of
the
halifax
county
school
system.
the
resulting
projected
90%
black
enrollment
at
brawley
and
57%
white
enrollment
at
scotland
neck
school
seems
to
us
to
bring
into
play
the
presumption
against
schools
that
are
substantially
disproportionate
in
their
racial
composition
that
this
court
last
term
said
in
the
other
swann
case
applies
in
the
context
of
disestablishing
a
dual
system.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
so
long
as
this
modification
of
the
racial
balance
fall
short
of
resegregation
and
is
accomplished
by
means
of
the
creation
of
a
new
school
district,
the
court
should
not
interfere
if
there
are
legitimate
educational
purposes
and
the
primary
purpose
is
not
racial.
but
we
see
nothing
warranting
this
novel
and
difficult
to
apply
test
and
the
mere
fact
that
the
zoning
here
was
accomplished
by
a
new
district
line
rather
than
by
ordinary
school
assignment's
zone
lines.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
think
that
inquiry
into
primary
purpose
which
is
a
very
difficult
one
is
really
irrelevant
to
how
the
case
should
be
decided.
the
district
court
said
it
could
not
say
which
of
the
purposes
it
found
was
the
primary
purpose.
the
court
of
appeals
nonetheless
proceeded
to
apply
its
primary
purpose
standard
actually
announced
in
the
companion
case
which
is
next
to
be
argued
in
(inaudible)
case.
we
don't
see
that
the
fact
that
new
district
line
has
been
interposed
rather
than
the
ordinary
method
of
the
assigning
students
within
the
district
should
bring
a
different
test
into
play
than
the
test
this
court
has
applied
right
along
in
the
context
of
school
desegregation
cases.
last
term,
for
example,
the
court
held
in
davis
against
the
school
commissioners
of
mobile
county
that
it
was
error
for
a
federal
court
in
remedying
a
dual
school
system
to
treat
the
eastern
part
of
metropolitan
mobile
an
isolation
from
the
rest
of
the
school
district.
if
a
different
result
would
have
been
required,
had
the
state
interposed
a
new
district
line
cutting
off
that
eastern
portion,
the
principle
of
that
case
and
many
of
the
court's
desegregation
cases
would
indeed
be
evanescent.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
was
before
the
court
was
a
single
school
district.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that's
the
question
whether
it
is
really
a
different
problem,
because
the
state
has
now
put
a
new
district
line
and
while
this
district
was
in
the
process
of
being
desegregated
and
the
process
of
having
the
school
system
disestablished,
that's
why
i
say
the
case
would
be
the
same
if
alabama
had
put
that
line
in
the
metropolitan
mobile
area.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that's
correct,
but
the
cases
would
be
very
similar
then
and
if
a
different
result
would
have
been
required
in
mobile,
had
that
change
in
state
law
been
made
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
the
question
before
the
court,
but
we
are
pointing
out
that
it
would
mean
that
the
principles
that
we
thought
were
established
in
the
mobile
case
would
be
one
that
could
easily
be
avoided.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
a
very
similar
case.
if
in
the
course,
in
the
process
of
desegregating
that
system
and
disestablishing
the
dual
system
that
had
been
operating
throughout
that
area,
the
state
had
interposed
a
new
district
line
cutting
off
that
portion,
a
rather
similar
problem
to
this
case
would
be
presented
that
was
the
analogy
that
i
was
pointing
out.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
certainly
true.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
much
more
so
throughout
the
area
as
a
whole.
here,
the
impact
is
very
drastic
on
the
relatively
small
number
of
students
in
the
immediate
area
of
scotland
neck.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
black
students
in
that
area
have
by
law
been
excluded
from
attending
the
only
white
only
school
there,
the
only
traditionally
white
school
and
now
90%
of
that
would
still
be
excluded.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
in
--
well,
we
are
dealing
only
with
a
small
number
of
students
in
this
case,
that's
the
fact
of
the
case.
the
state
chose
to
separate
out
an
extremely
small
little
school
district
here.
so
naturally
we
are
not
talking
about
large
numbers.
but
we
are
talking
about
individuals
with
constitutional
rights
here.
in
our
view
the
test
should
be
that
of
this
court's
green
decision.
that
when
in
disestablishing
a
dual
school
system
more
promising
courses
of
action
are
open
to
the
state.
the
state
has
a
heavy
burden
to
justify
its
choice
of
a
less
effective
method.
essentially,
the
test
would
be
whether
a
school
assignment
zone
would
have
been
properly
drawn
this
way
in
the
absence
of
splitting
the
district
up,
because
the
district
was
in
the
process
of
disestablishing
a
dual
system
and
we
think
it
plain
that
the
burden
on
the
state,
on
to
the
green
case
has
not
been
satisfied
here.
it
is
relevant
first
of
all
that
the
new
scotland
neck
school
district
with
only
695
students
is
far
smaller
than
the
state's
own
standards
concerning
the
desirable
and
minimally
acceptable
size
for
school
districts.
on
page
12
of
our
brief,
we
have
set
out
the
evidence
and
record
on
that.
this
has
been
made
even
more
anomalous
by
the
fact
that
both
halifax
county
and
the
town
of
scotland
neck
are
losing
population,
are
decreasing
in
size
according
to
the
1960
and
1970
census
figures;
not
normally
the
situation
where
you
would
be
breaking
up
rather
than
consolidating
school
districts.
purposes
found
by
the
district
court
for
chapter
31
also
fall
far
short
in
our
view
of
an
inadequate
justification,
more
local
control
over
the
schools
if
desired
can
be
achieved
without
selecting
out
so
abnormally
small
a
new
district
with
so
great
a
racial
effect
on
the
desegregation
process
in
the
immediate
vicinity.
and
the
need
for
increasing
school
expenditures
does
not
in
our
view
justify
fencing
off
the
only
traditionally
white
school
and
most
of
the
white
students
from
the
other
school
and
the
surrounding
area
and
making
the
improvements
only
in
that
school.
the
only
other
purpose
found
by
the
district
court
was
prevention
of
anticipated
white
flight
from
the
public
schools.
in
monroe
against
the
board
of
commissioners,
one
of
the
three
cases
of
the
green
trilogy.
that
this
court
emphatically
rejected
the
contention
that
was
strongly
made
there
that
fear
of
white
flight
can
justify
perpetuation
of
some
aspects
of
vestiges
of
the
dual
school
system.
that
holding,
we
believe
was
soundly
based
on
the
teaching
of
brown
and
cooper
against
aaron
that
community
acceptance
is
not
to
be
the
measure
of
the
constitutional
rights
of
school
children.
and
there
is
no
reason
that
we
can
say
the
part
of
from
holding
here,
the
respondents
emphasized
that
they
have
submitted
post
trial
affidavits
of
school
enrollment
figures
to
show
that
considerable
white
flight
has
materialized
in
this
district.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
thought
that;
that
was
in
the
other
context
that
it
wouldn’t
be
an
adequate
remedy
to
setup
a
situation
whereby
anticipated
rather
minor
changes
in
residential
patterns
would
lead
to
quick
resegregation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
thought
that
resegregation
was
largely
a
matter
of
action
that
the
state
has
taken,
that
leads
to
resegregation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
because
as
here
you
have
these
two
traditionally
1
through
12
school
located
only
three
quarters
of
the
mile
apart.
the
blacks
had
all
been
assigned
to
one,
the
whites
all
attended
the
other.
the
process
of
trying
to
desegregate
and
to
disestablish
the
duality
of
these
two
schools
under
this
court's
decision,
is
a
process
of
trying
to
break
down
this
overwhelming
historic
racial
identification
of
the
two
school.
it
seems
to
us
that
when
one
of
them
is,
because
of
the
peculiar
configuration
of
the
assignment
zone
that's
drawn
left
with
90%
black
population,
when
most
of
the
blacks
are
excluded
from
the
assignment
zone
to
the
white
school
and
the
white
school
is
trying
to
be
predominantly
white.
that
hasn't
broken
down
the
racial
identification
of
the
two
school
when
other
alternatives
are
readily
available,
that
was
what
the
court
said
in
green.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
at
all.
we
are
not
contending
for
any
principal
racial
balance
from
one
school.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
the
particular
facts
here.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
are
obviously
alternative
means
available
that
would
be
more
effective
in
disestablishing
the
dual
identification
of
these
schools
as
the
white
school
and
black
school,
and
no
adequate
justification
has
been
shown
for
adopting
this
less
effective
method
which
seems
to
us
to
perpetuate
the
duality.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
prior
to
1936,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
it
will
raise
very
different
issues
about
the
propriety
as
a
remedial
matter
of
extending
the
remedy
across
long
established
and
long
observed
district
lines.
here
the
state
has
interposed
a
new
district
line
within
the
district
that
was
in
the
process
of
disestablishing
its
dual
system.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
would
be
a
different
case.
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
a
different
result,
but
it's
not
a
case
that
we
are
addressing
here.
in
conclusion,
i
would
just
like
to
say
about
the
submissions
that
the
respondents
have
made
as
to
the
post
trial
white
flight
that
has
occurred.
of
course,
this
is
--
we
don't
know
where
these
children
have
gone
or
how
long
or
what
they
would
have
done,
had
chapter
31
been
implemented.
this
is
all
assuming
that
these
affidavits
are
accurate.
but
basically,
we
believe
that
these
affidavits
should
not
affect
the
decision
here
and
that
it
is
as
important
for
this
court
today
as
it
always
has
been
to
reject
the
preposition
of
the
course
to
appellate
decision
in
school
desegregation
cases,
can
be
influenced
by
community
resistance
to
desegregation
decrease,
whether
that
resistance
has
taken
upon
as
it
had
in
some
instances
of
bus
burnings
or
boycotts
or
as
it
reportedly
has
here
taken
the
form
of
withdrawal
of
some
of
the
students
from
the
schools.
thank
you.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
consolidated
case
and
the
next
case
to
be
argued
were
decided
together
by
the
court
of
appeals
by
the
fourth
circuit
sitting
embank
and
presents
similar
issues.
each
case
involves
a
predominantly
black,
predominantly
rural
school
district
which
has
been
operating
a
dual
system
of
racially
segregate
schools.
in
each
case,
instead
of
proceeding
to
desegregate
the
entire
district
as
the
unit
in
which
had
been
operating,
the
state
has
sought
to
split
the
district
in
two
by
carving
out
a
small,
more
white
and
more
urban
enclave
to
operate
as
a
separate
school
district.
in
the
present
case
involving
the
schools
of
halifax
county,
north
carolina,
the
united
states
filed
suit
alleging
that
the
splitting
of
the
district
unconstitutionally
impeded
the
disestablishment
of
the
dual
system
and
additional
plaintiffs
subsequently
intervened
that
are
now
before
the
court
in
the
companion
case
which
has
been
consolidated
with
ours.
the
next
case
to
be
heard
which
involves
the
schools
of
greensville
county,
virginia
was
brought
by
private
plaintiffs
and
the
united
states
did
not
participate
in
the
case
that
any
stage
of
the
proceedings
until
this
court
granted
certiorari.
the
united
states
has
now
filed
a
brief,
amicus
curiae
in
support
of
the
petitioners
in
that
case.
in
each
case,
the
split
off
was
held
unconstitutional
by
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
by
a
divided
vote.
our
position
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
applied
the
wrong
standard
and
reached
the
wrong
result
in
both
cases.
there
was
also
a
third
case
decided
on
the
same
day
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
which
that
court
by
a
differently
divided
vote
upheld
another
district
court
order
enjoining
another
similar
split
off
in
north
carolina
and
no
petition
for
certiorari
was
filed
in
that
case
and
it
is
not
before
this
court.
now,
the
facts
of
the
present
case
can
conveniently
be
summarized
by
reference
to
the
very
readable
foldout
maps
that
appear
in
this
large
size
appendix
filed
by
the
petitioners
in
the
companion
case,
in
the
consolidated
case.
if
the
court
please,
i’d
like
to
turn
first
to
the
map
at
page
4b,
which
is
a
map
of
halifax
county,
the
county
at
issue
here.
it’s
a
largely
rural
area
which
is
some
40
miles
across
at
its
widest
point.
scotland
neck
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
this
is
the
whole
county,
depicted
in
this
map
and
scotland
neck,
the
town
which
has
been
carved
out
by
this
new
legislation
appears
in
the
southeastern
portion
scotland
neck’s
school
is
labeled,
that
little
rectangle
around
scotland
neck’s
school
and
brawley
school
and
the
limits
of
the
town
of
scotland
neck
are
within
that
rectangle,
that
irregularly
shaped
figure
in
lighter
lines.
the
shaded
areas
in
the
northern
portion,
labeled,
well,
in
roanoke
rapids
are
two
separately
administered
school
districts,
each
of
which
is
several
times
more
populous
than
the
town
of
scotland
neck.
those
have
been
administered
a
separate
districts
right
along.
the
rest
of
the
county
has
been
operating
as
a
single
school
district
known
as
the
halifax
county
administrative
unit
and
scotland
neck
has
been
included
in
that
school
system
since
1936.
and
until
1965,
all
of
the
schools
in
that
county
system
were
completely
segregated
by
race.
in
1965,
a
freedom
of
choice
plan
was
instituted
but
very
little
desegregation
resulted
from
that,
for
example,
during
the
1968-1969
school
year,
the
last
one
under
unmodified
freedom
of
choice,
all
of
the
whites
students
still
attended
the
four
traditionally
white
schools
and
97%
of
the
black
students
attended
the
other
all-black
schools.
the
district
at
that
time
was
77%
black.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
entire
district
that
--
the
halifax
county
school
district.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct
your
honor.
that
is
the
latest
--
it’s
been
operating
since
1936.
and
at
that
time
also,
more
than
90%
of
the
students
in
that
county
system
were
transported
to
school
by
school
buses.
the
record
shows,
in
the
summer
of
19
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it’s
a
little
more
than
10,000
your
honor.
i
think
its
10,655
if
i
recall.
in
the
summer
of
1968,
shortly
after
the
grim
trilogy
of
decisions
in
this
court,
the
department
of
justice
notified
the
county
school
board
here
pursuant
to
the
1964
civil
rights
act
that
operation
of
its
schools
did
not
comply
with
constitutional
requirements.
negotiations
followed
between
the
department
and
the
board,
and
the
board
agreed
in
the
course
of
those
negotiations
to
adopt
the
plan
for
disestablishing
the
dual
system
to
be
effective
by
the
fall
of
1969
and
to
take
some
interim
steps
for
the
1968-1969
school
year
and
the
student
assignments
which
are
--
well,
the
great
assignments
reflected
on
this
map
reflect
that
interim
agreement
with
the
department
of
justice.
the
agreement
was
widely
publicized
in
the
local
press
and
because
of
this
agreement
the
government
did
not
file
suit
at
that
time.
in
the
meantime,
the
county
school
board
had
asked
the
north
carolina
department
of
public
instruction
to
determine
how
the
board
could
meet
its
desegregation
obligations
and
to
reprimand
an
organizational
plan
designed
for
the
best
possible
education
of
the
children
in
the
county
system.
and
the
department
during
1968
studied
the
county
system
and
in
september
of
that
year,
recommended
both
a
long
ranged
plan
involving
the
construction
of
two
new
high
schools
and
the
so-called
interim
plan
using
the
existing
facilities.
and
that
interim
plan
is
depicted
on
the
next
foldout
map
at
page
8b
of
this
appendix.
it
provided
for
assignments
on
the
basis
of
four
geographic
zones,
this
is
numbered
districts
divided
by
broken
lines
with
the
--
a
pairing
of
grades
between
some
of
the
schools
including
scotland
neck’s
school
and
brawley
school,
the
schools
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
town
of
scotland
neck,
less
than
a
mile
apart
from
each
other,
these
two
school
buildings.
under
this
interim
plan,
some
white
students
would
have
been
assigned
to
each
of
the
formerly
all-black
school
and
none
of
the
four
traditionally
white
schools
would
have
a
like
majority
assigned
to
it.
the
county
school
board
did
not
adopt
the
interim
plan
and
in
february
of
1969
it
also
repudiated
its
agreement
with
the
department
of
justice
to
come
forward
with
a
plan
for
disestablishing
the
system
by
that
fall
and
instead
voted
to
return
to
freedom
of
choice
as
the
assignment
method.
and
shortly
thereafter
in
march
of
1969,
the
north
carolina
legislature
enacted
a
local
law,
chapter
31
of
the
1969
session
laws
of
north
carolina,
providing
for
a
new
school
district
to
be
bounded
by
the
corporate
limits
of
the
town
of
scotland
neck.
and
for
a
supplemental
tax
assessment
to
finance
the
schools
there
upon
approval
by
the
towns
voters
who
did
approve
in
a
special
election
conducted
in
april
of
1969.
the
complaint
in
the
present
suit
was
then
filed
in
june.
if
implemented,
chapter
31
would
have
carved
out
of
the
county
system
which
had
10,655
students
as
i
mentioned,
a
small
enclave
in
which
695
resided.
of
this
695
students,
57%
were
white
and
43%
black
in
contrast
to
the
county
systems
overall
student
population
which
was
22%
white
and
77%
black,
1%
indian.
the
court
of
appeals
deemed
it
significant
that
the
removal
of
the
695
students
from
the
county
system
would
shift
the
overall
ratio
by
only
three
points
to
80%
black
and
19%
white.
but
this
seems
to
us
an
unrealistic
way
to
look
at
the
effect
of
chapter
31
because
it
is
a
pairing
from
the
map
before
us,
that
in
most
of
the
county,
districts
2,
3,
and
4,
there
would
be
no
effect
of
chapter
31
or
only
a
very
negligible
effect
and
the
chapter
31’s
impact
would
be
concentrated
in
district
1
and
in
that
district
would
touch
mostly
the
scotland
neck
and
brawley
schools.
and
that
impact
is
shown
on
the
next
map
that
appears
to
which
i
will
turn
tomorrow
when
the
argument
is
resumed.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
pointed
out
yesterday
that
with
a
dual
school
system
still
in
effect
in
halifax
county
in
1969,
15
years
after
brown,
the
county
turned
away
from
the
recommendations
of
the
state
department
of
public
instruction
and
from
its
agreement
with
the
department
of
justice
both
of
which
looked
toward
dis-establishment
of
that
dual
school
system
and
instead
through
chapter
31
of
the
1969
session
laws,
there
was
carved
out
a
small
separate
school
district
for
scotland
neck,
while
as
a
mathematical
matter,
the
removal
of
these
695
students
could
have
only
a
limited
effect
on
the
racial
percentages
for
the
county
system
as
whole,
the
effect
would
be
very
substantial
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
scotland
neck
and
i
was
about
to
turn
to
the
fold
out
math
in
this
large
sized
appendix
filed
by
the
petitioners
in
the
consolidated
case
at
page
12b
where
there
is
some
indication
of
what
the
effect
of
chapter
31's
implementation
would
be
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
scotland
neck
within
district
1
of
the
state's
interim
plan.
the
impact
particularly
is
on
the
student
assignments
to
the
scotland
neck
school
and
to
the
brawley
school.
the
two
grade
1
to
12
schools
that
have
been
conducted
by
this
county
system
less
than
one
mile
apart
from
each
other.
brawley
being
an
all
black
school
and
scotland
neck
the
traditionally
white
school.
the
assignment
figures
printed
on
this
map
were
compiled
by
the
county
board
of
education.
the
map
was
submitted
by
the
county
board
as
an
exhibit
to
a
motion
of
theirs.
and
if
chapter
31
had
been
implemented,
these
figures
show
that
brawley
school
would
be
more
than
90%
black
while
the
scotland
neck
school
would
be
57%
white
and
43%
black.
by
contrast
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
those
are
the
figures
for
bakers
school,
the
366.
brawley
figures
are
underneath
805
negro,
83
white.
so
more
than
90%
of
the
assigned
students.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
the
capacity
of
the
facility.
the
total
is
888.
well,
it's
slightly
less
than
90%,
i
am
sorry
i
am
mathematically
was
slightly
off
there.
but
close
to
90%
of
the
students
would
be
black
at
brawley
and
at
scotland
neck
it
would
be
57%
white
and
43%
black.
by
contrast,
under
the
interim
plan,
which
the
state
department
of
public
instruction
had
recommended,
the
assignments
to
brawley
would
be
slightly
less
than
70%
black
and
those
to
scotland
neck
more
than
66%
black,
a
very
similar
ratio.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
77%
black,
22%
white.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
correct
your
honor.
and
there
was
also
a
transfer
plan
adapted
by
the
scotland
neck
city
board
of
education,
but
struck
down
as
unconstitutional
by
the
court
of
appeals
which
would
have
increased
the
disparity
under
chapter
31
even
more
on
the
basis
of
the
first
application
filed.
the
scotland
neck
school
would
have
gone
up
to
74%
white.
the
chapter
31
has
not
gone
into
effect,
because
the
court
of
appeals
stayed
its
mandate
pending
this
court's
decision
and
the
schools
are
now
operating
under
a
modified
version
of
the
state's
interim
plan
which
we
have
described
in
some
detail
on
page
14
of
our
brief
in
footnote
25.
now
the
vice
of
chapter
31
as
we
see
it,
is
very
similar
to
the
vice
of
the
north
carolina
anti-busing
law
struck
down
by
this
court
last
term
in
north
carolina
board
of
education
against
swann.
chapter
31
would
substantially
impair,
would
be
an
obstacle
to
disestablishment
of
the
dual
school
system
in
the
scotland
neck
brawley
area
of
this
county
school
system.
it
would
fence
off
most
of
the
black
students
in
that
area
from
the
traditionally
white
only
scotland
neck
school
and
would
fence
off
most
of
the
whites
in
that
area
from
the
nearby
formerly
all
black
brawley
school.
as
the
district
court
said,
its
effect
would
be
to
create
a
refuge
from
desegregation
for
white
students
of
the
halifax
county
school
system.
the
resulting
projected
90%
black
enrollment
at
brawley
and
57%
white
enrollment
at
scotland
neck
school
seems
to
us
to
bring
into
play
the
presumption
against
schools
that
are
substantially
disproportionate
in
their
racial
composition
that
this
court
last
term
said
in
the
other
swann
case
applies
in
the
context
of
disestablishing
a
dual
system.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
so
long
as
this
modification
of
the
racial
balance
fall
short
of
resegregation
and
is
accomplished
by
means
of
the
creation
of
a
new
school
district,
the
court
should
not
interfere
if
there
are
legitimate
educational
purposes
and
the
primary
purpose
is
not
racial.
but
we
see
nothing
warranting
this
novel
and
difficult
to
apply
test
and
the
mere
fact
that
the
zoning
here
was
accomplished
by
a
new
district
line
rather
than
by
ordinary
school
assignment's
zone
lines.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
think
that
inquiry
into
primary
purpose
which
is
a
very
difficult
one
is
really
irrelevant
to
how
the
case
should
be
decided.
the
district
court
said
it
could
not
say
which
of
the
purposes
it
found
was
the
primary
purpose.
the
court
of
appeals
nonetheless
proceeded
to
apply
its
primary
purpose
standard
actually
announced
in
the
companion
case
which
is
next
to
be
argued
in
(inaudible)
case.
we
don't
see
that
the
fact
that
new
district
line
has
been
interposed
rather
than
the
ordinary
method
of
the
assigning
students
within
the
district
should
bring
a
different
test
into
play
than
the
test
this
court
has
applied
right
along
in
the
context
of
school
desegregation
cases.
last
term,
for
example,
the
court
held
in
davis
against
the
school
commissioners
of
mobile
county
that
it
was
error
for
a
federal
court
in
remedying
a
dual
school
system
to
treat
the
eastern
part
of
metropolitan
mobile
an
isolation
from
the
rest
of
the
school
district.
if
a
different
result
would
have
been
required,
had
the
state
interposed
a
new
district
line
cutting
off
that
eastern
portion,
the
principle
of
that
case
and
many
of
the
court's
desegregation
cases
would
indeed
be
evanescent.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
was
before
the
court
was
a
single
school
district.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that's
the
question
whether
it
is
really
a
different
problem,
because
the
state
has
now
put
a
new
district
line
and
while
this
district
was
in
the
process
of
being
desegregated
and
the
process
of
having
the
school
system
disestablished,
that's
why
i
say
the
case
would
be
the
same
if
alabama
had
put
that
line
in
the
metropolitan
mobile
area.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that's
correct,
but
the
cases
would
be
very
similar
then
and
if
a
different
result
would
have
been
required
in
mobile,
had
that
change
in
state
law
been
made
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
the
question
before
the
court,
but
we
are
pointing
out
that
it
would
mean
that
the
principles
that
we
thought
were
established
in
the
mobile
case
would
be
one
that
could
easily
be
avoided.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
a
very
similar
case.
if
in
the
course,
in
the
process
of
desegregating
that
system
and
disestablishing
the
dual
system
that
had
been
operating
throughout
that
area,
the
state
had
interposed
a
new
district
line
cutting
off
that
portion,
a
rather
similar
problem
to
this
case
would
be
presented
that
was
the
analogy
that
i
was
pointing
out.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
certainly
true.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
much
more
so
throughout
the
area
as
a
whole.
here,
the
impact
is
very
drastic
on
the
relatively
small
number
of
students
in
the
immediate
area
of
scotland
neck.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
black
students
in
that
area
have
by
law
been
excluded
from
attending
the
only
white
only
school
there,
the
only
traditionally
white
school
and
now
90%
of
that
would
still
be
excluded.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
in
--
well,
we
are
dealing
only
with
a
small
number
of
students
in
this
case,
that's
the
fact
of
the
case.
the
state
chose
to
separate
out
an
extremely
small
little
school
district
here.
so
naturally
we
are
not
talking
about
large
numbers.
but
we
are
talking
about
individuals
with
constitutional
rights
here.
in
our
view
the
test
should
be
that
of
this
court's
green
decision.
that
when
in
disestablishing
a
dual
school
system
more
promising
courses
of
action
are
open
to
the
state.
the
state
has
a
heavy
burden
to
justify
its
choice
of
a
less
effective
method.
essentially,
the
test
would
be
whether
a
school
assignment
zone
would
have
been
properly
drawn
this
way
in
the
absence
of
splitting
the
district
up,
because
the
district
was
in
the
process
of
disestablishing
a
dual
system
and
we
think
it
plain
that
the
burden
on
the
state,
on
to
the
green
case
has
not
been
satisfied
here.
it
is
relevant
first
of
all
that
the
new
scotland
neck
school
district
with
only
695
students
is
far
smaller
than
the
state's
own
standards
concerning
the
desirable
and
minimally
acceptable
size
for
school
districts.
on
page
12
of
our
brief,
we
have
set
out
the
evidence
and
record
on
that.
this
has
been
made
even
more
anomalous
by
the
fact
that
both
halifax
county
and
the
town
of
scotland
neck
are
losing
population,
are
decreasing
in
size
according
to
the
1960
and
1970
census
figures;
not
normally
the
situation
where
you
would
be
breaking
up
rather
than
consolidating
school
districts.
purposes
found
by
the
district
court
for
chapter
31
also
fall
far
short
in
our
view
of
an
inadequate
justification,
more
local
control
over
the
schools
if
desired
can
be
achieved
without
selecting
out
so
abnormally
small
a
new
district
with
so
great
a
racial
effect
on
the
desegregation
process
in
the
immediate
vicinity.
and
the
need
for
increasing
school
expenditures
does
not
in
our
view
justify
fencing
off
the
only
traditionally
white
school
and
most
of
the
white
students
from
the
other
school
and
the
surrounding
area
and
making
the
improvements
only
in
that
school.
the
only
other
purpose
found
by
the
district
court
was
prevention
of
anticipated
white
flight
from
the
public
schools.
in
monroe
against
the
board
of
commissioners,
one
of
the
three
cases
of
the
green
trilogy.
that
this
court
emphatically
rejected
the
contention
that
was
strongly
made
there
that
fear
of
white
flight
can
justify
perpetuation
of
some
aspects
of
vestiges
of
the
dual
school
system.
that
holding,
we
believe
was
soundly
based
on
the
teaching
of
brown
and
cooper
against
aaron
that
community
acceptance
is
not
to
be
the
measure
of
the
constitutional
rights
of
school
children.
and
there
is
no
reason
that
we
can
say
the
part
of
from
holding
here,
the
respondents
emphasized
that
they
have
submitted
post
trial
affidavits
of
school
enrollment
figures
to
show
that
considerable
white
flight
has
materialized
in
this
district.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
thought
that;
that
was
in
the
other
context
that
it
wouldn’t
be
an
adequate
remedy
to
setup
a
situation
whereby
anticipated
rather
minor
changes
in
residential
patterns
would
lead
to
quick
resegregation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
thought
that
resegregation
was
largely
a
matter
of
action
that
the
state
has
taken,
that
leads
to
resegregation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
because
as
here
you
have
these
two
traditionally
1
through
12
school
located
only
three
quarters
of
the
mile
apart.
the
blacks
had
all
been
assigned
to
one,
the
whites
all
attended
the
other.
the
process
of
trying
to
desegregate
and
to
disestablish
the
duality
of
these
two
schools
under
this
court's
decision,
is
a
process
of
trying
to
break
down
this
overwhelming
historic
racial
identification
of
the
two
school.
it
seems
to
us
that
when
one
of
them
is,
because
of
the
peculiar
configuration
of
the
assignment
zone
that's
drawn
left
with
90%
black
population,
when
most
of
the
blacks
are
excluded
from
the
assignment
zone
to
the
white
school
and
the
white
school
is
trying
to
be
predominantly
white.
that
hasn't
broken
down
the
racial
identification
of
the
two
school
when
other
alternatives
are
readily
available,
that
was
what
the
court
said
in
green.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
at
all.
we
are
not
contending
for
any
principal
racial
balance
from
one
school.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
the
particular
facts
here.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
are
obviously
alternative
means
available
that
would
be
more
effective
in
disestablishing
the
dual
identification
of
these
schools
as
the
white
school
and
black
school,
and
no
adequate
justification
has
been
shown
for
adopting
this
less
effective
method
which
seems
to
us
to
perpetuate
the
duality.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
prior
to
1936,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
it
will
raise
very
different
issues
about
the
propriety
as
a
remedial
matter
of
extending
the
remedy
across
long
established
and
long
observed
district
lines.
here
the
state
has
interposed
a
new
district
line
within
the
district
that
was
in
the
process
of
disestablishing
its
dual
system.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
would
be
a
different
case.
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
a
different
result,
but
it's
not
a
case
that
we
are
addressing
here.
in
conclusion,
i
would
just
like
to
say
about
the
submissions
that
the
respondents
have
made
as
to
the
post
trial
white
flight
that
has
occurred.
of
course,
this
is
--
we
don't
know
where
these
children
have
gone
or
how
long
or
what
they
would
have
done,
had
chapter
31
been
implemented.
this
is
all
assuming
that
these
affidavits
are
accurate.
but
basically,
we
believe
that
these
affidavits
should
not
affect
the
decision
here
and
that
it
is
as
important
for
this
court
today
as
it
always
has
been
to
reject
the
preposition
of
the
course
to
appellate
decision
in
school
desegregation
cases,
can
be
influenced
by
community
resistance
to
desegregation
decrease,
whether
that
resistance
has
taken
upon
as
it
had
in
some
instances
of
bus
burnings
or
boycotts
or
as
it
reportedly
has
here
taken
the
form
of
withdrawal
of
some
of
the
students
from
the
schools.
thank
you.
