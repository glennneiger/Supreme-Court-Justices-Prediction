mr.
william
t.
joyner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
had
intended
to
emphasize
two
basic
facts
that
we
think
are
very
important
here.
number
one,
the
quality
of
the
community
support.
number
two,
the
proof
of
the
unrealistic
nature
of
the
district
plan
and
that
it
has
failed
of
its
purpose
as
shown
by
experience.
then
i
wanted
to
go
into
the
analysis
of
the
two
plans
presented
to
the
district
court.
in
view
of
the
other
arguments
and
in
view
of
some
questions
from
the
bench
i
would
like
to
state
what
i
think
is
our
position.
it's
our
position
number
one,
that
as
between
the
plans,
before
the
district
court,
one
i
call
the
scotland
neck
plan
and
the
other
the
district
court
plan.
even
if
there
had
been
no
danger
of
white
flight,
the
scotland
neck
plan
was
superior
as
a
desegregation
measure
and
should
have
been
judged
by
the
court.
if
there
is
any
doubt
about
that,
it's
our
second
position,
that
has
between
the
two
plans,
the
scotland
neck
plan
promised
realistically
to
work
and
to
work
now,
largely
because
of
the
community
support.
the
district
plan
would
almost
(inaudible)
from
the
start.
now,
let
me
lay
this
as
the
foundations
of
our
argument.
as
i
understand
that
there
is
a
great
difference
between
desegregation
and
integration
and
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
to
take
part
as
almost
profoundly
and
180
degree
turn
from
brawley,
which
says
it's
constitutional
to
assign
by
race
or
color.
we
could
say
that
it
is
unconstitutional
not
to
assign
by
race
and
that
the
answer
is
that
there
is
found
a
remaining
vestige
of
the
evil
of
law-imposed
segregation.
and
that
remaining
vestige
must
be
uprooted
and
that
the
measure
adopted
to
destroy
that
remaining
vestige
must
have
a
realistic
opportunity
to
succeed
and
now
let
us
see
what
the
remaining
vestige
is
in
this
case.
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case
of
any
defect
or
remaining
vestige
of
state-imposed
segregation,
except
two
things.
in
the
scotland
neck,
where
the
resident
population
of
--
student
population
of
400
white
and
300
black.
in
1968,
1969
or
before
that,
only
approximately
39
black
students
had
exercised
their
freedom
of
choice
and
about
325
white
students
resident
outside
of
scotland
neck
had
exercised
that
choice
to
come
into
scotland
neck.
now,
it's
entirely
possible
and
we
do
not
contest
the
fact
that
because
of
that
failure
of
freedom
of
choice
was
a
mental
attitude,
a
reluctance
to
enter
school,
dominate
in
which
another
race
was
highly
predominant.
and
that,
that
mental
attitude
was
in
part,
we
concede
a
remaining
vestige
of
state-imposed
segregation.
that
was
the
thing
to
be
attacked
and
that
the
question
to
be
decided
by
the
district
court
was
whether
the
scotland
neck
plan
or
the
district
plan
was
better
designed
to
change
that
mental
attitude
to
be
a
corrected
measure
and
our
basic
position
is
that
the
district
court
had
the
opportunity
to
accept
the
scotland
neck
plan
or
reject
it
and
it
rejected
it.
it
had
the
opportunity
to
accept
it
and
had
they
accepted
it,
there
would
have
been
one
school
in
the
district
that
was
truly
a
unitary
school.
now
the
opponents
have
said
you
had
a
white
school
in
scotland
neck
and
a
black
school
in
brawley.
we
contend
that
that
is
not
correct,
you
cannot
designate
5743
as
a
white
school
and
the
probabilities
are
tremendously
strong
that
the
attendants
would
be
approximately
50%.
mr.
william
t.
joyner
right.
that's
correct.
and
we
say
that,
that
was
the
community
support
as
a
tremendous
chance
of
success
and
if
it
succeeds,
it
can
be
a
model
or
it
can
be
proof
to
the
public
that
blacks
and
whites
can
work
together
successfully
and
in
harmony
to
give
quality
education.
now,
good
deal
has
been
said
about
the
brawley.
scotland
neck
situation.
i
want
to
address
myself
to
that,
that
seems
to
be
the
principal
contention
i
would
rather
say.
now
what
was
the
failure,
what
was
the
wrong
that
was
done?
the
wrong
that
was
done
by
the
state-imposed
segregation
was
referenced
to
brawley,
whereas
the
scotland
neck
was
using
the
brawley
school
to
take
care
of
the
black
resident
pupils
in
the
scotland
neck.
mr.
william
t.
joyner
to
follow
the
state-imposed
segregation,
the
school
in
the
scotland
neck
was
attended
only
by
whites
and
the
black
pupils
living
in
the
scotland
neck
went
to
brawley
and
scotland
neck
did
make
use
of
brawley
to
that
extent.
it
didn't
have
to
put
up
two
schools
within
it'153,
tilton
and
others
against
richardson,
findlaws
borders.
now
if
that
is
the
wrong,
then
that
wrong
was
completely
cured
by
the
statute
because
by
the
statute
and
after
the
first
further
filed
by
the
scotland
neck
board,
the
plan
of
the
board
announced
in
that
answer
and
proclaimed
by
advertiser,
was
to
take
all
of
those
300
black
students
that
had
been
going
to
brawley,
most
of
them
as
a
part
of
the
remaining
vestige
of
state-imposed
segregation
and
assignment
to
scotland
neck
and
to
assign
to
scotland
neck
it's
resident
whites
and
the
transfer
situation
doesn't
enter
into
the
constitutionality
at
all
because
the
board
announced
in
its
answer
and
in
its
first
and
in
its
advertisement,
that
the
transfers
in
and
out
would
be
according
to
a
plan
approved
by
the
court,
but
the
statement
were
made
yet
that
the
brawley
people
who
were
excluded
from
scotland
neck,
they're
not
excluded
from
scotland
neck
at
all.
they
have
the
right
of
freedom
of
choice
to
come
into
scotland
neck
in
accordance
with
such
plan
as
the
district
court
may
approve.
now,
something
has
been
said
about
presumptions.
as
i
understand
in
the
swann
case
there
are
two
types
of
presumptions;
number
1,
that
there
is
a
presumption
based
on
disparity
of
racial
imbalance,
that
there
is
a
remaining
vestige,
that
is
a
presumption.
well,
that
presumption
has
been
followed
here
because
we
have
accepted
that
and
we
have
set
forward
a
plan
adapted
by
the
statute
to
correct
that
situation.
so
that
presumption
has
been
met.
there's
another
presumption
and
that
is
a
presumption
of
bad
faith
on
the
part
of
members
of
an
organization,
where
there
has
been
state-imposed
segregation.
now
we
contend
that,
that
presumption
has
been
overcome
by
the
unchallenged
great
weight
of
the
testimony
--
there's
contradictory
testimony,
as
to
the
good
faith
of
the
members
of
this
community.
let
me
go
on
very
briefly
over
that.
in
the
testimony
of
mr.
powell
--
and
usually
it's
in
the
index,
in
the
appendix,
a
resident
of
scotland
neck,
a
black
member
of
the
board.
he
testified
that
he
came
back
at
new
york
where
he
had
an
important
job
or
good-paying
job
in
the
post
office
department
to
accept
employment
in
rocky
mount,
and
to
live
in
the
scotland
neck,
some
20-25
miles
rocky
mount.
and
significantly
he
said,
he
came
back
in
almost
all
these
words,
because
he
wanted
to
find
better
schools
for
his
children,
because
he
could
have
more
influence
on
the
school
in
a
small
community
and
because
the
people
of
scotland
neck
were
interested
in
improving
the
quality
of
their
school.
that's
also
in
evidence
in
the
deposition
of
mr.
hendrik
lee
harrison
taken
by
the
government.
that
the
people
of
scotland
neck
have
never
rebelled
against
desegregation.
they
have
never
fought
it,
they've
never
had
any
incidents,
they've
had
excellent
race
relations,
but
they've
been
tremendously
concerned
about
the
quality
of
their
school
and
one
of
the
concerns
about
the
quality
of
the
school
was
they
threatened
the
white
flight,
flight
of
white
students.
and
let
me
emphasize
that,
i
think,
the
record
supports
the
conclusion
that
the
fear
of
white
flight
and
the
occurrence
of
white
flight
was
not
due
to
a
reluctance
to
associate
with
members
of
the
earlier
race.
that
fear
of
white
flight
was
that
it
would
impair
the
quality
of
the
schools,
and
the
white
flight
is
occasioned
and
caused
primarily
of
the
fear
of
the
declining
quality
of
the
schools.
he
testified
that
the
people
in
the
scotland
neck
did
not
think
white
flight
was
any
answer
to
the
situation.
they
did
not
think
--
mr.
william
t.
joyner
that's
right
and
the
private
schools,
they
think
the
private
schools
are
not
the
answer,
that
private
schools
pose
a
great
threat
to
the
public
schools.
that
wherever
there
is
massive
white
flight
by
any
group
of
children,
from
the
public
school,
the
public
schools
must
be
impaired.
now,
very
briefly,
but
where
some
of
the
things,
the
question
of
transfers
as
i
said
is
--
the
suit
against
--
this
suit
was
started
in
june,
in
august,
i
think
it
was
the
16,
this
defendant
scotland
neck
city
board
of
education
was
made
a
defendant,
john
was
a
part
of
it
for
the
first
time
and
it
had
to
appear
before
judge
larkins
and
judge
butler,
hold
the
motion
for
preliminary
injunction
in
four
days.
they
filed
a
very
hastened
answer;
they
got
into
the
court
and
they
found
that
there
was
a
very
serious
attack
on
the
question
of
transfers.
they
were
so
anxious
to
establish
a
quality
school
that
they
did
not
keep
it
to
undertake
any
litigation
on
that.
there
was
permission
of
the
court,
they
filed
an
further
amended
action
and
they
said
plainly
in
that
amended
answer
which
is
exhibit
a
to
our
brief
that
we
propose
to
operate
a
school
that
will
embrace
all
of
the
students,
black
and
white,
resident
in
scotland
neck
and
transfers
in
and
out
will
be
made
in
accordance
with
a
plan
to
be
approved
by
the
court.
in
their
quest
for
the
answers,
they
requested
the
court
to
retain
jurisdiction
in
order
that
it
could
supervise
those
transfers
and
in
judge
larkins
opinion,
he
said
that
they
would
anticipate
no
trouble
in
having
those
transfers.
the
injunction
would
have
friezed
all
the
money
that
had
been
collected
as
a
special
tax.
the
committee
got
the
permission
of
the
court
to
advertise
or
to
solicit
more
contributions
to
defend
the
law
suit.
the
board
then
published
an
advertisement,
a
three
page
advertisement
in
which
it
gave
a
blueprint
of
its
proposed
operations.
it
made
it
public,
it
announced
to
the
public
that
it
was
their
intention
to
do
what
the
first
further
answer
said
and
it
was
their
intention
to
conduct
a
unitary
school
without
any
prejudice
whatsoever
between
blacks
and
whites
and
to
public
and
to
conduct
a
school
in
which
there
would
be
not
discernible
lines
drawn
between
that.
that
also
is
a
blueprint
of
good
faith
that
was
published
to
the
group.
more
on
the
question
of
good
faith,
when
the
case
came
up
for
final
hearing
before
judge
larkins
and
judge
butler,
scotland
neck
examined
mr.
shields,
the
chairman
of
the
board.
he
testified
as
to
the
quality
of
the
race
relations
in
the
community,
he
testified
as
to
the
intent
of
the
board,
he
was
examined
by
mr.
josey
(ph)
about
everything
that
was
said
in
that
advertisement
which,
by
the
way,
is
appendix
b
in
our
brief.
he
testified
that
he
and
every
member
of
the
board
truly
met
what
they
have
said
and
that
they
continued
to
have
those
purposes.
he
would
stand
over
to
the
other
side
to
examine
and
his
whole
examination
is
in
exhibit
c
to
our
brief.
and
at
the
end
of
his
examination
about
the
intent
of
the
board
that's
on
page
50
of
our
brief
in
exhibit
c.
mr.
chairman
said
alright
your
witness.
mr.
kennedy
represented
the
department
of
justice,
no
questions
your
honor.
judge
larkins
asked
him
one
question,
did
you
receive
any
response?
his
answer
was,
he
received
a
very
favorable
response
and
there
were
no
other
questions.
mr.
josey
then
had
sworn
the
other
four
members
of
the
board
and
he
asked
each
of
them,
they
had
heard
the
testimony
of
mr.
shields
and
they
said
--
they
didn't
answer
it
in
that
way.
he
said,
that
they
had
heard
the
testimony
and
agreed
with
what
he
said
and
agreed
with
the
advertisement
and
what
he
said
about
the
advertisement,
would
they
hold
up
their
hand?
everyone
had
held
up
the
hands
as
shown
by
the
record
on
page
15,
on
our
brief
attention,
tangent
to
the
record.
again,
mr.
josey
tended
them
for
cross
examination
and
there
was
not
a
question
asked.
they
are
committed
to
the
policies
set
forth
in
that
advertisement.
i
also
point
out
with
reference
to
that,
that
in
this
case
that
was
not
introduced
by
the
opponents,
by
the
petitioner
here,
one
witness
to
question
the
good
faith
of
the
board
and
what
it
said
in
its
first
further
answer
or
what
it
said
in
its
advertisement.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
was
not
introduced
one
witness
resident
in
scotland
neck
or
the
scotland
neck
area
that
complained
of
the
scotland
neck
plan
or
expressed
opposition
to
it.
now,
let
me
go
back,
or
that
was
a
conclusion
i
would
draw
from
that.
number
one,
that
that
un-contradicted
evidence,
unchallenged
evidence,
and
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
case
to
the
contrary
proves
completely
the
good
faith
of
these
men
who
were
trying
to
achieve
quality
education
in
scotland
neck
and
overcomes
the
presumption
of
evil
referred
to
in
this
one
case
of
a
desire
to
perpetuate
segregation
or
any
evil
desire.
mr.
william
t.
joyner
your
honor,
that's
not
merely
a
question
of
opinion
by
me,
but
there
is
ample
evidence
in
the
record
to
that
effect
and
there
is
no
evidence
to
the
contrary.
on
that
mr.
josey
answered,
that's
been
more
certain
than
i
did,
but
in
my
opinion
based
on
the
record,
there
is
no
question
what
that
scotland
neck
would
have
asked
for
a
special
district
entirely
irrespective
of
desegregation
because
they
were
not
getting
sufficient
money
to
support
their
school,
they
needed
more
money.
judge
larkins
says
in
his
opinion,
they
had
not
been
getting
what
they
regarded
and
what
the
court
found
supported
their
evidence
on
equal
break
from
the
county.
mr.
william
t.
joyner
the
county
controls
most
of
the
funds
and
the
county
did
not
have
a
special
tax,
and
as
i
understand
it,
mr.
josey
can
answer
this
better
than
i
can.
they
get
from
the
county
and
a
lot
more
by
pupil
and
they
would
do
that
if
they
were
special
district
but
the
thing
that
they
wanted
was
the
special
tax
that
would
enable
them
to
employ
better
teachers
--
mr.
william
t.
joyner
well,
i
understand.
it
remains
subject
to
--
the
property
in
scotland
neck,
will
pay
a
county
school
tax
that
goes
to
the
county
and
scotland
neck's
proper
proportion
part
is
sent
back
to
scotland
neck.
but
this
tax
would
be
in
addition
to
that.
so
this
district,
it
doesn't
take
any
money
off,
any
property
off
the
tax
that
goes
to
this
county's
support.
mr.
william
t.
joyner
i
am
not
sure
that
i
understand
that
--
mr.
william
t.
joyner
well,
i
understand
that
the
county
school
tax
which
is
paid
as
a
property
tax
on
the
property
throughout
the
county
including
scotland
neck
and
that
scotland
neck
receives
not
the
portion
of
the
tax
that
it
pays,
but
it
does
receive
from
from
the
county
an
allocation
for
each
student
enrolled
in
the
scotland
neck
school
and
that
which
still
continues
to
be
--
that
tax
would
still
be
paid
and
the
scotland
neck
would
have
a
special
tax.
let
me
just
say
one
thing
about
brawley.
this
court
has
said
that
the
objective
is
to
uproot
all
vestiges
of
remaining
segregation.
well,
that
primarily
has
rural
students,
non-rural
students,
scotland
neck
primarily
is
a
school
for
let’s
say,
for
these
children
in
that
area.
now
the
use
of
brawley’s,
i
have
said
was
that
it
took
care
of
the
scotland
neck’s
students.
but
now,
scotland
neck
is
not
sending
a
one
to
brawley.
scotland
neck
is
enrolling
under
the
scotland
neck
plan,
would
enroll
everyone
of
them
in
its
own
schools.
that
is
the
value
of
that
plan.
and
my
time
is
nearly
up,
so
i
have
to
be
quite
brief.
the
plan
is
a
complete
establishment
of
a
unitary
school
in
scotland
neck
and
there
would
be
no
black
students
sent
from
scotland
neck
to
brawley,
enroller
still
have
a
freedom
of
choice
to
enter
the
scotland
neck
school,
but
–
and
the
other
two
things
i
was
saying,
number
one;
that
the
scotland
neck
plan
as
being
a
better
plan
than
the
district
plan
does
set
up
one
school
that
can
be
a
model
and
it
doesn't
assign
a
single
student
to
it's
schools
outside
of
the
community
in
which
they
live.
they
all
would
come
in
the
--
the
plan
would
not
cause
the
irritations
and
the
resistance
that
the
brawley
plan
caused.
and
i
have
no
time
to
go
into
this
mr.
josey
may
go
into
it,
but
it's
in
our
brief.
we
contend
and
a
part
of
it
is
set
forth
specific
in
our
brief
that
elements
of
advantage
the
scotland
neck
plan
would
have
even
if
there
would
be
no
white
flight.
now
bear
in
mind,
it's
our
view
that
if
white
flight
is
caused
by
the
loss
of
confidential
that
people
in
maintaining
the
quality
of
their
schools,
that
they
fear
that
to
get
a
quality
education,
they
must
go
to
private
schools,
and
that's
the
danger
that
exists
everywhere.
but
as
a
matter
of
fact,
whether
that's
true
or
not,
the
scotland
neck
plan
is
preferable
because
the
scotland
neck
plan
secondly
would
have
a
greater
opportunity
of
deterring
white
flight,
than
would
the
district
plan.
and
i
mentioned
my
time
is
up.
mr.
william
t.
joyner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
had
intended
to
emphasize
two
basic
facts
that
we
think
are
very
important
here.
number
one,
the
quality
of
the
community
support.
number
two,
the
proof
of
the
unrealistic
nature
of
the
district
plan
and
that
it
has
failed
of
its
purpose
as
shown
by
experience.
then
i
wanted
to
go
into
the
analysis
of
the
two
plans
presented
to
the
district
court.
in
view
of
the
other
arguments
and
in
view
of
some
questions
from
the
bench
i
would
like
to
state
what
i
think
is
our
position.
it's
our
position
number
one,
that
as
between
the
plans,
before
the
district
court,
one
i
call
the
scotland
neck
plan
and
the
other
the
district
court
plan.
even
if
there
had
been
no
danger
of
white
flight,
the
scotland
neck
plan
was
superior
as
a
desegregation
measure
and
should
have
been
judged
by
the
court.
if
there
is
any
doubt
about
that,
it's
our
second
position,
that
has
between
the
two
plans,
the
scotland
neck
plan
promised
realistically
to
work
and
to
work
now,
largely
because
of
the
community
support.
the
district
plan
would
almost
(inaudible)
from
the
start.
now,
let
me
lay
this
as
the
foundations
of
our
argument.
as
i
understand
that
there
is
a
great
difference
between
desegregation
and
integration
and
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
to
take
part
as
almost
profoundly
and
180
degree
turn
from
brawley,
which
says
it's
constitutional
to
assign
by
race
or
color.
we
could
say
that
it
is
unconstitutional
not
to
assign
by
race
and
that
the
answer
is
that
there
is
found
a
remaining
vestige
of
the
evil
of
law-imposed
segregation.
and
that
remaining
vestige
must
be
uprooted
and
that
the
measure
adopted
to
destroy
that
remaining
vestige
must
have
a
realistic
opportunity
to
succeed
and
now
let
us
see
what
the
remaining
vestige
is
in
this
case.
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case
of
any
defect
or
remaining
vestige
of
state-imposed
segregation,
except
two
things.
in
the
scotland
neck,
where
the
resident
population
of
--
student
population
of
400
white
and
300
black.
in
1968,
1969
or
before
that,
only
approximately
39
black
students
had
exercised
their
freedom
of
choice
and
about
325
white
students
resident
outside
of
scotland
neck
had
exercised
that
choice
to
come
into
scotland
neck.
now,
it's
entirely
possible
and
we
do
not
contest
the
fact
that
because
of
that
failure
of
freedom
of
choice
was
a
mental
attitude,
a
reluctance
to
enter
school,
dominate
in
which
another
race
was
highly
predominant.
and
that,
that
mental
attitude
was
in
part,
we
concede
a
remaining
vestige
of
state-imposed
segregation.
that
was
the
thing
to
be
attacked
and
that
the
question
to
be
decided
by
the
district
court
was
whether
the
scotland
neck
plan
or
the
district
plan
was
better
designed
to
change
that
mental
attitude
to
be
a
corrected
measure
and
our
basic
position
is
that
the
district
court
had
the
opportunity
to
accept
the
scotland
neck
plan
or
reject
it
and
it
rejected
it.
it
had
the
opportunity
to
accept
it
and
had
they
accepted
it,
there
would
have
been
one
school
in
the
district
that
was
truly
a
unitary
school.
now
the
opponents
have
said
you
had
a
white
school
in
scotland
neck
and
a
black
school
in
brawley.
we
contend
that
that
is
not
correct,
you
cannot
designate
5743
as
a
white
school
and
the
probabilities
are
tremendously
strong
that
the
attendants
would
be
approximately
50%.
mr.
william
t.
joyner
right.
that's
correct.
and
we
say
that,
that
was
the
community
support
as
a
tremendous
chance
of
success
and
if
it
succeeds,
it
can
be
a
model
or
it
can
be
proof
to
the
public
that
blacks
and
whites
can
work
together
successfully
and
in
harmony
to
give
quality
education.
now,
good
deal
has
been
said
about
the
brawley.
scotland
neck
situation.
i
want
to
address
myself
to
that,
that
seems
to
be
the
principal
contention
i
would
rather
say.
now
what
was
the
failure,
what
was
the
wrong
that
was
done?
the
wrong
that
was
done
by
the
state-imposed
segregation
was
referenced
to
brawley,
whereas
the
scotland
neck
was
using
the
brawley
school
to
take
care
of
the
black
resident
pupils
in
the
scotland
neck.
mr.
william
t.
joyner
to
follow
the
state-imposed
segregation,
the
school
in
the
scotland
neck
was
attended
only
by
whites
and
the
black
pupils
living
in
the
scotland
neck
went
to
brawley
and
scotland
neck
did
make
use
of
brawley
to
that
extent.
it
didn't
have
to
put
up
two
schools
within
it'153,
tilton
and
others
against
richardson,
findlaws
borders.
now
if
that
is
the
wrong,
then
that
wrong
was
completely
cured
by
the
statute
because
by
the
statute
and
after
the
first
further
filed
by
the
scotland
neck
board,
the
plan
of
the
board
announced
in
that
answer
and
proclaimed
by
advertiser,
was
to
take
all
of
those
300
black
students
that
had
been
going
to
brawley,
most
of
them
as
a
part
of
the
remaining
vestige
of
state-imposed
segregation
and
assignment
to
scotland
neck
and
to
assign
to
scotland
neck
it's
resident
whites
and
the
transfer
situation
doesn't
enter
into
the
constitutionality
at
all
because
the
board
announced
in
its
answer
and
in
its
first
and
in
its
advertisement,
that
the
transfers
in
and
out
would
be
according
to
a
plan
approved
by
the
court,
but
the
statement
were
made
yet
that
the
brawley
people
who
were
excluded
from
scotland
neck,
they're
not
excluded
from
scotland
neck
at
all.
they
have
the
right
of
freedom
of
choice
to
come
into
scotland
neck
in
accordance
with
such
plan
as
the
district
court
may
approve.
now,
something
has
been
said
about
presumptions.
as
i
understand
in
the
swann
case
there
are
two
types
of
presumptions;
number
1,
that
there
is
a
presumption
based
on
disparity
of
racial
imbalance,
that
there
is
a
remaining
vestige,
that
is
a
presumption.
well,
that
presumption
has
been
followed
here
because
we
have
accepted
that
and
we
have
set
forward
a
plan
adapted
by
the
statute
to
correct
that
situation.
so
that
presumption
has
been
met.
there's
another
presumption
and
that
is
a
presumption
of
bad
faith
on
the
part
of
members
of
an
organization,
where
there
has
been
state-imposed
segregation.
now
we
contend
that,
that
presumption
has
been
overcome
by
the
unchallenged
great
weight
of
the
testimony
--
there's
contradictory
testimony,
as
to
the
good
faith
of
the
members
of
this
community.
let
me
go
on
very
briefly
over
that.
in
the
testimony
of
mr.
powell
--
and
usually
it's
in
the
index,
in
the
appendix,
a
resident
of
scotland
neck,
a
black
member
of
the
board.
he
testified
that
he
came
back
at
new
york
where
he
had
an
important
job
or
good-paying
job
in
the
post
office
department
to
accept
employment
in
rocky
mount,
and
to
live
in
the
scotland
neck,
some
20-25
miles
rocky
mount.
and
significantly
he
said,
he
came
back
in
almost
all
these
words,
because
he
wanted
to
find
better
schools
for
his
children,
because
he
could
have
more
influence
on
the
school
in
a
small
community
and
because
the
people
of
scotland
neck
were
interested
in
improving
the
quality
of
their
school.
that's
also
in
evidence
in
the
deposition
of
mr.
hendrik
lee
harrison
taken
by
the
government.
that
the
people
of
scotland
neck
have
never
rebelled
against
desegregation.
they
have
never
fought
it,
they've
never
had
any
incidents,
they've
had
excellent
race
relations,
but
they've
been
tremendously
concerned
about
the
quality
of
their
school
and
one
of
the
concerns
about
the
quality
of
the
school
was
they
threatened
the
white
flight,
flight
of
white
students.
and
let
me
emphasize
that,
i
think,
the
record
supports
the
conclusion
that
the
fear
of
white
flight
and
the
occurrence
of
white
flight
was
not
due
to
a
reluctance
to
associate
with
members
of
the
earlier
race.
that
fear
of
white
flight
was
that
it
would
impair
the
quality
of
the
schools,
and
the
white
flight
is
occasioned
and
caused
primarily
of
the
fear
of
the
declining
quality
of
the
schools.
he
testified
that
the
people
in
the
scotland
neck
did
not
think
white
flight
was
any
answer
to
the
situation.
they
did
not
think
--
mr.
william
t.
joyner
that's
right
and
the
private
schools,
they
think
the
private
schools
are
not
the
answer,
that
private
schools
pose
a
great
threat
to
the
public
schools.
that
wherever
there
is
massive
white
flight
by
any
group
of
children,
from
the
public
school,
the
public
schools
must
be
impaired.
now,
very
briefly,
but
where
some
of
the
things,
the
question
of
transfers
as
i
said
is
--
the
suit
against
--
this
suit
was
started
in
june,
in
august,
i
think
it
was
the
16,
this
defendant
scotland
neck
city
board
of
education
was
made
a
defendant,
john
was
a
part
of
it
for
the
first
time
and
it
had
to
appear
before
judge
larkins
and
judge
butler,
hold
the
motion
for
preliminary
injunction
in
four
days.
they
filed
a
very
hastened
answer;
they
got
into
the
court
and
they
found
that
there
was
a
very
serious
attack
on
the
question
of
transfers.
they
were
so
anxious
to
establish
a
quality
school
that
they
did
not
keep
it
to
undertake
any
litigation
on
that.
there
was
permission
of
the
court,
they
filed
an
further
amended
action
and
they
said
plainly
in
that
amended
answer
which
is
exhibit
a
to
our
brief
that
we
propose
to
operate
a
school
that
will
embrace
all
of
the
students,
black
and
white,
resident
in
scotland
neck
and
transfers
in
and
out
will
be
made
in
accordance
with
a
plan
to
be
approved
by
the
court.
in
their
quest
for
the
answers,
they
requested
the
court
to
retain
jurisdiction
in
order
that
it
could
supervise
those
transfers
and
in
judge
larkins
opinion,
he
said
that
they
would
anticipate
no
trouble
in
having
those
transfers.
the
injunction
would
have
friezed
all
the
money
that
had
been
collected
as
a
special
tax.
the
committee
got
the
permission
of
the
court
to
advertise
or
to
solicit
more
contributions
to
defend
the
law
suit.
the
board
then
published
an
advertisement,
a
three
page
advertisement
in
which
it
gave
a
blueprint
of
its
proposed
operations.
it
made
it
public,
it
announced
to
the
public
that
it
was
their
intention
to
do
what
the
first
further
answer
said
and
it
was
their
intention
to
conduct
a
unitary
school
without
any
prejudice
whatsoever
between
blacks
and
whites
and
to
public
and
to
conduct
a
school
in
which
there
would
be
not
discernible
lines
drawn
between
that.
that
also
is
a
blueprint
of
good
faith
that
was
published
to
the
group.
more
on
the
question
of
good
faith,
when
the
case
came
up
for
final
hearing
before
judge
larkins
and
judge
butler,
scotland
neck
examined
mr.
shields,
the
chairman
of
the
board.
he
testified
as
to
the
quality
of
the
race
relations
in
the
community,
he
testified
as
to
the
intent
of
the
board,
he
was
examined
by
mr.
josey
(ph)
about
everything
that
was
said
in
that
advertisement
which,
by
the
way,
is
appendix
b
in
our
brief.
he
testified
that
he
and
every
member
of
the
board
truly
met
what
they
have
said
and
that
they
continued
to
have
those
purposes.
he
would
stand
over
to
the
other
side
to
examine
and
his
whole
examination
is
in
exhibit
c
to
our
brief.
and
at
the
end
of
his
examination
about
the
intent
of
the
board
that's
on
page
50
of
our
brief
in
exhibit
c.
mr.
chairman
said
alright
your
witness.
mr.
kennedy
represented
the
department
of
justice,
no
questions
your
honor.
judge
larkins
asked
him
one
question,
did
you
receive
any
response?
his
answer
was,
he
received
a
very
favorable
response
and
there
were
no
other
questions.
mr.
josey
then
had
sworn
the
other
four
members
of
the
board
and
he
asked
each
of
them,
they
had
heard
the
testimony
of
mr.
shields
and
they
said
--
they
didn't
answer
it
in
that
way.
he
said,
that
they
had
heard
the
testimony
and
agreed
with
what
he
said
and
agreed
with
the
advertisement
and
what
he
said
about
the
advertisement,
would
they
hold
up
their
hand?
everyone
had
held
up
the
hands
as
shown
by
the
record
on
page
15,
on
our
brief
attention,
tangent
to
the
record.
again,
mr.
josey
tended
them
for
cross
examination
and
there
was
not
a
question
asked.
they
are
committed
to
the
policies
set
forth
in
that
advertisement.
i
also
point
out
with
reference
to
that,
that
in
this
case
that
was
not
introduced
by
the
opponents,
by
the
petitioner
here,
one
witness
to
question
the
good
faith
of
the
board
and
what
it
said
in
its
first
further
answer
or
what
it
said
in
its
advertisement.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
was
not
introduced
one
witness
resident
in
scotland
neck
or
the
scotland
neck
area
that
complained
of
the
scotland
neck
plan
or
expressed
opposition
to
it.
now,
let
me
go
back,
or
that
was
a
conclusion
i
would
draw
from
that.
number
one,
that
that
un-contradicted
evidence,
unchallenged
evidence,
and
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
case
to
the
contrary
proves
completely
the
good
faith
of
these
men
who
were
trying
to
achieve
quality
education
in
scotland
neck
and
overcomes
the
presumption
of
evil
referred
to
in
this
one
case
of
a
desire
to
perpetuate
segregation
or
any
evil
desire.
mr.
william
t.
joyner
your
honor,
that's
not
merely
a
question
of
opinion
by
me,
but
there
is
ample
evidence
in
the
record
to
that
effect
and
there
is
no
evidence
to
the
contrary.
on
that
mr.
josey
answered,
that's
been
more
certain
than
i
did,
but
in
my
opinion
based
on
the
record,
there
is
no
question
what
that
scotland
neck
would
have
asked
for
a
special
district
entirely
irrespective
of
desegregation
because
they
were
not
getting
sufficient
money
to
support
their
school,
they
needed
more
money.
judge
larkins
says
in
his
opinion,
they
had
not
been
getting
what
they
regarded
and
what
the
court
found
supported
their
evidence
on
equal
break
from
the
county.
mr.
william
t.
joyner
the
county
controls
most
of
the
funds
and
the
county
did
not
have
a
special
tax,
and
as
i
understand
it,
mr.
josey
can
answer
this
better
than
i
can.
they
get
from
the
county
and
a
lot
more
by
pupil
and
they
would
do
that
if
they
were
special
district
but
the
thing
that
they
wanted
was
the
special
tax
that
would
enable
them
to
employ
better
teachers
--
mr.
william
t.
joyner
well,
i
understand.
it
remains
subject
to
--
the
property
in
scotland
neck,
will
pay
a
county
school
tax
that
goes
to
the
county
and
scotland
neck's
proper
proportion
part
is
sent
back
to
scotland
neck.
but
this
tax
would
be
in
addition
to
that.
so
this
district,
it
doesn't
take
any
money
off,
any
property
off
the
tax
that
goes
to
this
county's
support.
mr.
william
t.
joyner
i
am
not
sure
that
i
understand
that
--
mr.
william
t.
joyner
well,
i
understand
that
the
county
school
tax
which
is
paid
as
a
property
tax
on
the
property
throughout
the
county
including
scotland
neck
and
that
scotland
neck
receives
not
the
portion
of
the
tax
that
it
pays,
but
it
does
receive
from
from
the
county
an
allocation
for
each
student
enrolled
in
the
scotland
neck
school
and
that
which
still
continues
to
be
--
that
tax
would
still
be
paid
and
the
scotland
neck
would
have
a
special
tax.
let
me
just
say
one
thing
about
brawley.
this
court
has
said
that
the
objective
is
to
uproot
all
vestiges
of
remaining
segregation.
well,
that
primarily
has
rural
students,
non-rural
students,
scotland
neck
primarily
is
a
school
for
let’s
say,
for
these
children
in
that
area.
now
the
use
of
brawley’s,
i
have
said
was
that
it
took
care
of
the
scotland
neck’s
students.
but
now,
scotland
neck
is
not
sending
a
one
to
brawley.
scotland
neck
is
enrolling
under
the
scotland
neck
plan,
would
enroll
everyone
of
them
in
its
own
schools.
that
is
the
value
of
that
plan.
and
my
time
is
nearly
up,
so
i
have
to
be
quite
brief.
the
plan
is
a
complete
establishment
of
a
unitary
school
in
scotland
neck
and
there
would
be
no
black
students
sent
from
scotland
neck
to
brawley,
enroller
still
have
a
freedom
of
choice
to
enter
the
scotland
neck
school,
but
–
and
the
other
two
things
i
was
saying,
number
one;
that
the
scotland
neck
plan
as
being
a
better
plan
than
the
district
plan
does
set
up
one
school
that
can
be
a
model
and
it
doesn't
assign
a
single
student
to
it's
schools
outside
of
the
community
in
which
they
live.
they
all
would
come
in
the
--
the
plan
would
not
cause
the
irritations
and
the
resistance
that
the
brawley
plan
caused.
and
i
have
no
time
to
go
into
this
mr.
josey
may
go
into
it,
but
it's
in
our
brief.
we
contend
and
a
part
of
it
is
set
forth
specific
in
our
brief
that
elements
of
advantage
the
scotland
neck
plan
would
have
even
if
there
would
be
no
white
flight.
now
bear
in
mind,
it's
our
view
that
if
white
flight
is
caused
by
the
loss
of
confidential
that
people
in
maintaining
the
quality
of
their
schools,
that
they
fear
that
to
get
a
quality
education,
they
must
go
to
private
schools,
and
that's
the
danger
that
exists
everywhere.
but
as
a
matter
of
fact,
whether
that's
true
or
not,
the
scotland
neck
plan
is
preferable
because
the
scotland
neck
plan
secondly
would
have
a
greater
opportunity
of
deterring
white
flight,
than
would
the
district
plan.
and
i
mentioned
my
time
is
up.
