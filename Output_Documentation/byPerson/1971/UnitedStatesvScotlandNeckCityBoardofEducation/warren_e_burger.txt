whole

now.
chief

warren
e.

when
you
speak

now
--
chief

warren
e.

what’s
the

do
you

that
in
mind?

mr.

you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
not
sure
i
have
your
response
clearly
in
mind
mr.
wallace,
let
me
see
if
get
it.
if
in
the
mobile
case
the
area
on
the
far
side
of
the
railroad
tracks
had
been
treated
as
a
separate
unit
by
the
courts
in
the
fifth
circuit.
if
in
that
case
that
part
of
mobile
had
been
separated
by
a
lawful
process
from
the
city
of
mobile
itself,
then
would
we
have
factually
comparable
case
to
what
we
have
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
could
be
physically
the
same,
however
factually
in
the
two
cases
the
change
in
mobile
would
have
had
a
very
drastic
impact
on
school
compositions,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
much
more
so
than
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
call
it
very
drastic
here?
what
is
the
percentage
impact?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
drastic
in
numbers
though?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.

over
time.
so
that
has
cut
into
the
time
alloted
to
you.
mr.

have
you
separated
out.
i
think
there

10
minutes
left.

not?
you
