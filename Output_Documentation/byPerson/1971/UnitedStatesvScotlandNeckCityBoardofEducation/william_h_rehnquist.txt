well,
mr.

in
scotland
neck
a
complaint
was
not
simply
that
halifax

not
raising
enough
money
overall
for
education,
but
that
of
the
money
it
did
raise,
scotland
neck
wasn't
receiving
as
much
per
pupil
or
per
school
as
other
areas
in
the
county.

justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under

did

had
some
discretion
as
to
how
they
will
spend
money
collected
by
the
