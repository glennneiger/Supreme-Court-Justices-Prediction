e.

mr.
wahl,
in
this
building
as
you
know
we
have
an
expanded
library
with
many
thousands
of
volumes
and
the
department
of
justice
has
a
comparable
library
of
many
thousands
of
books.
on
a
constitutional
basis,
how
can
you
stop
short
of
giving
every
prison
the
same
kind
of
tools
that
we
have
here
to
decide
the
case
and
that
the
department
of
justice
and
the
state
of
california's
counterpart
has
carry
out
this
duty?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
us
narrow
it
down.
should
they
have
everything
that
we
have
and
the
department
of
justice
has
and
the
attorney
general
of
california
has
on
matters
relating
to
criminal
law,
habeas
corpus,
and
post-conviction?
chief
justice
warren
e.

how
many
volumes
is
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
which
volumes?
i
will
not
ask
you
to
list
them,
but
who
is
going
to
identify
those
volumes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
judge
zercoli
have
some
idea
that
you
could
speak
for
all
the
inmates
of
the
prisoners
in
california?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
a
matter
of
policy,
but
is
not
as
a
matter
of
constitution,
i
think,
a
very
narrow
limitation
on
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
did
in
oral
argument.
in
oral
argument,
this
morning
he
said
none
by
the
constitution?
as
a
matter
of
policy
he
was
willing
to
say
that
it
is
desirable
to
have
some?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
many
sets
they
need
to
prisons?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
not
think
the
state
of
california
was
entitled

the
benefit
of
the
wisdom
of
these
three
judges
who
have
this
idea
on
what
it
would
--
what
would
satisfy
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.

indication

book,

book?

they
do
not
know
how
should
that
director
of
prisons
know?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
did
they
require?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
some

experimented
with
placing
a
legal
aid
lawyer
right
in
the
institution.
has
california
done
any
of
that
other
than
