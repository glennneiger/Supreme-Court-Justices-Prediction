(inaudible)
that
the
state
position
is
that
there
is
no
duty
whatever
constitutionally
required
despite
any
law
book?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
therefore
whatever
you
provide
is
a
matter
of
the
state?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
issue
here,
is
that
issue
here
that
we
have?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
you
mentioned,
it
used
to
be
enacted
in
california
statute
that
inmates
may
have
law
books
in
their
cells?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
citation
is
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
it
must
be
based
on
cases
of
sometime?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
you
find
then
in
strength
to
your
position
the
equal
protection
position
in
that
fact?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
he
may
supplement.
he
may
purchase
books
as
i
understand
it
outside
the
list
of
12
that
are
available
in
the
prison
library?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whereas
you
suggest
the
indigent
canno6t?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
that
uniformly
true
in
all
the
counties
of
california
or
only
some?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
wahl,
if
you
prevail
i
take
it
and
we
have
to
lay
down
some
kind
of
standard
that
we
have
let
us
say
constitutional
right
(inaudible)
could,
what
do
you
suggest
have
you
say
earlier
something
about
whatever
maybe
adequate
or
the
need,
what
does
that
mean?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
this
order
suggest
that,
i
thought
the
order
did
nothing
more
than
say
this
regulations
are
no
good.
does
it
provide
any
standard
to
guide
the
commission
of
correction
if
the
new
regulation
should
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
wahl,
if
there
were
something
like
that,
you
probably
would
not
be
here
asking
for
books
in
the
prison
library,
would
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
there
were
a
provision
that
any
inmate
will
have
the
services
of
counsel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
do
not
think
it
had?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
from
advantage
point
i
would
say
that
is
longer
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
connection
with,
what
case
were
they
filed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
then
these
legislations
that
mr.
wahl
mentioned
to
us
is
that
they
can
access.
they
change
the
situation
very
much
aware?
