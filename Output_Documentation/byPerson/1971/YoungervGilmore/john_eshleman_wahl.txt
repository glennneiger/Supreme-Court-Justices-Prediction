mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
about
tools
which
are
necessary
for
access
to
the
courts.
in
the
english
speaking
world
the
common
law
entries
for
history
of
development
of
tools
which
are
necessary
for
access
to
courts
has
been
a
history
wherein
the
executive
has
resisted
the
extension
and
the
granting
of
these
tools,
starting
with
the
great
struggle
to
achieve
the
great
writ
of
freedom,
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
highlighted
by
the
english
statute
in
1695
wherein
treason
defendants
were
allowed
to
have
counsel
at
the
trials.
before
1695,
neither
treason
nor
felony
defendants
of
course
could
have
counsel.
then
highlighted
by
our
own
sixth
amendment
because
at
that
time
in
england
even
felony
defendants
could
not
have
counsel,
they
did
not
get
the
right
to
counsel
until
1836.
finally
highlighted
by
our
great
line,
your
great
line
of
equal
protection
cases
rendering
rights
to
transcripts
and
counsel
beginning
perhaps
in
1956
with
griffin
versus
illinois
through
andrews
versus
california,
so
on
and
so
forth.
as
i
have
mentioned
the
executive
has
historically
resisted
the
making
available
tools
for
access
to
the
courts
and
we
believe
that
executive
branch
of
the
california
government
again
does
so
here
and
does
so
strongly
and
does
so
quite
ably
through
my
brother
nock.
we
concur
with
the
attorney
general
of
california
that
this
is
a
proper
case
to
be
heard
by
a
three-judge
court
and
the
three-judge
court
was
properly
convened.
we
think
the
strong
interest
of
the
california
government
even
resisting
the
order
of
granting
relief
which
came
from
that
three-judge
court
shows
that
this
is
the
kind
of
case
that
congress
had
in
mind
in
passing
section
2281
of
title
28.
this
regulation
which
was
promulgated
pursuant
to
authority
granted
by
the
california
penal
code,
by
the
california
director
of
corrections,
involves
the
legislative
policy
of
california.
section
5058
of
the
california
penal
code
allows
the
director
of
corrections
to
provide
regulations,
to
establish
regulations
for
the
government
of
the
california
prisons
and
the
change
from
at
his
pleasure
and
he
has
done
so
here
as
counsel
pointed
out.
in
september
of
1966,
five
years
ago,
he
promulgated
a
regulation
limiting
law
books
in
prison
libraries
to
12
named
law
books
with
which
you
are
familiar
from
counsel’s
argument.
he
also
incidentally
in
the
same
transmittal
letter
in
which
he
promulgated
that
regulation,
promulgated
an
additional
regulation
ordering
all
law
books
in
inmates'
personal
possession
removed
and
destroyed.
since
that
time
the
california
legislature
has
enacted
california
penal
code,
section
2600
which
allows
inmates
to
receive
and
own
law
books
in
their
own
cells.
but
the
restriction
and
this
is
the
whole
aspect
of
this
regulation
which
is
really
onerous,
the
restriction
of
prison
libraries
to
12
named
law
books
we
contend
violates
the
rights
of
indigent
inmates
and
only
indigent
inmates
to
access
to
the
courts,
it
is
an
integral
aspect
of
due
process
of
law
and
their
rights
to
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
not
that
it
was
not
cited
in
my
brief
mr.
justice
blackmun.
the
hatfield
case
i
think
supports
our
position
and
is
distinguishable
from
this
case
because
hatfield
had
to
do
with
the
regulations
involved
in
one
oregon
prison.
this
regulation
applies
statewide
to
all
california
prisons
and
penal
institutions.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
well,
no
sir,
but
i
believe
the
regulation
attack
there
was
a
time
space
and
method
regulation
in
one
particular
oregon
prison.
it
was
attacked
by
the
inmate
of
that
person.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
i
would
--
i
could
argue
either
way
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
i
do
not
think
the
case
is
a
good
case.
i
think
the
dictum
in
the
case
concerning,
first
stating
that
prison
authorities
have
no
obligation
to
provide
prisoners
with
opportunities
to
search
for
legal
loopholes
is
a
feeling
type
of
statement,
but
i
do
not
think
that
it
reaches
the
questions
which
we
reach
here
which
are
access
to
the
courts
in
due
process
of
law
access
to
the
courts
and
equal
protection
of
the
laws
with
regard
to
the
indigent
prisoners.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
yes,
your
honor,
justice
brennan.
the
section
2600
was
enacted,
i
believe
in
1969,
am
i
not
correct
counsel,
68.
after
this
case,
after
this
action
was
filed
and
after
we
had
obtained
a
temporary
restraining
order
which
although
it
is
almost
moot
at
this
point
remains
in
effect
by
stipulation
in
order
prohibiting
california
prison
officials
from
removing
books
from
inmate’s
cells.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
the
--
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
yes,
your
honor.
the
inmates
may
purchase
law
books
and
legal
opinions,
anything
that
is
allowed
to
pass
through
the
united
states
post
office
with
the
exemption
of
perhaps
matter
which
might
be
considered
obscene,
inflammatory,
this
is
--
perhaps
it
worry
out
in
that
regard,
but
subject
only
to
reasonable
limitations
concerning
space.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
the
best
tool
you
can
have,
if
you
want
to
go
in
the
court
is
a
lawyer,
it
is
the
best
way
you
can
get.
the
second
best
tool
if
you
cannot
afford
a
lawyer
is
access
to
the
law,
access
to
the
opinions,
to
the
substance,
to
the
procedural
writing
on
the
law.
i
think
the
inmate
that
is
very
wealthy
can
retain
counsel.
the
inmate
that
has
means,
but
not
quite
as
much
means
can
buy
law
books.
the
inmate
that
has
nothing
can
buy
nothing.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
yes,
he
may.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
the
indigent
may
not
or
cannot.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
this
is
the
most
difficult
question,
but
it
is
the
question
which
we
squarely
need.
i
think
that
you
do
no
have
to
give
inmates
obviously
benedict
on
admiralty.
this
is
extreme.
obviously
they
do
not
need
this.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
no,
your
honor.
they
should
not.
they
do
not
need
this.
they
should
have
what
they
need
for
meaningful
access
to
the
courts
on
the
personal
ground.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
i
would
say
--
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
in
the
argument
in
the
court
below
judge
zercoli
(ph)
asked
mr.
nock
and
myself
if
we
could
coordinate
on
establishing
a
list
of
law
books
for
california
prisons.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
i
think
he
only
asked
the
question,
your
honor
and
i
said
that
i
would
consider
this
one
of
the
most
weighty
responsibilities
that
anybody
could
have,
but
i
would
attempt
it
because
it
would
be
better
than
the
present
situation.
i
think
that
counsel
supports
our
position
that
additional
books
are
needed
in
his
brief.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
well,
he
does
not
say
that
the
–-
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
yes,
i
believe
though
that
when
he
admits
in
his
opening
brief
on
page
22,
the
three
additional
law
books
in
the
prison
libraries
giving
knowledge
of
venue,
jurisdiction,
proper
parties,
respondent
and
exhaustion
of
remedies
and
perhaps
hopefully
does
not
say
this
even
proper
remedies.
for
instance,
whether
it
should
be
a
petition
for
writ
of
coram
nobis
or
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
which
in
california
are
brought
in
different
courts.
petition
for
habeas
corpus
is
brought
in
the
courts
which
has
jurisdiction
over
the
county
in
which
the
prisoner
is
incarcerated.
petition
of
writ
of
coram
nobis
is
brought
in
the
court
where
the
petitioner
was
convicted.
he
admits
in
his
brief
that
three
more
books
would
give
the
use
procedural
or
this
procedural
law
make
it
available
to
the
prisoners.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
well,
your
honor
that
is
no
substitute
for
law
books.
if
it
is
--
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
i
put
very
little
value.
i
think
that
counsel’s
position
is
or
rather
the
state's
position
is
that
this
--
that
all
an
inmate
needs
to
do
is
allege
facts
on
a
blank,
on
his
blank
forms
and
hand
them
in
so
to
speak
and
the
courts
will
do
everything
that
is
necessary
to
ensure
that
the
inmate
gets
a
fair
hearing.
well,
this
is
impossible
by
the
number
of
petitions
that
are
filed.
the
inmate
who
files
a
post
conviction
petition
has
a
tremendous
burden
because
he
has
already
had
a
trial.
perhaps
he
has
had
an
appeal,
but
as
you
know
from
the
brief
of
amicus,
california
does
not
at
this
point
inform
inmates
or
who
have
been
convicted
that
they
have
a
right
to
an
appeal
and
a
right
to
counsel
on
appeal
immediately
after
their
appeal.
so
many
times
the
inmates'
first
shot
in
essence
an
substitute
for
an
appeal
is
a
petition
for
writ
of
coram
nobis
or
petition
for
habeas
corpus.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
in
general,
your
honor
and
i
cannot
speak
for
all
proceedings,
i
have
been
appointed
in
one
proceeding
myself
and
that
was
in
a
petition
for
writ
of
coram
nobis.
after
the
inmate
had
filed
his
petition
with
the
court
and
the
court
had
decided
that
this
petition
was
worthy
of
appointment
of
counsel
--
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
no
he
is
not,
he
is
not.
the
inmate
has
--
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
only
when
the
court
decides
there
is
some
substance
to
it.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
right.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
and
on
appeal.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
i
believe
it
is
true
throughout
the
state,
your
honor.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
a
counsel
may
be
appointed
pursuant
to
two
statutes
that
are
part
of
the
california
penal
code
for
trial
court
or
personal
proceedings
and
for
appellant
proceedings.
there
is
one
statute
that
covers
first
instance
appointment
and
one
statute
that
covers
an
appellant
point.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
i
am
sure
that
somebody
could
do
this,
but
it
would
have
to
be
more
than
a
handbook.
it
would
have
to
perhaps
a
book
with
a
supplement
and
the
supplement
--
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
yes.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
watkins
criminal
procedure
was
cited
by
counsel
earlier
and
i
was
fairly
certain,
but
i
checked
during
the
noon
hour
and
it
is
supplemented
every
two
years.
the
latest
supplement
in
your
library
upstairs
is
dated,
mr.
watkins
promulgating
letters
dated
january
15,
1970.
this
is
insufficient.
i
think
that
it
would
be
possible
justice
white
to
write,
publish
the
kind
of
book
you
are
talking
about
and
i
think
this
is
embraced
within
the
terms
of
the
three-judge
court’s
order.
the
three-judge
court
did
not
order
an
extensive
argumentation
of
prison
law
libraries.
it
left
the
whole
matter
open.
it
merely
ordered
the
state
to
come
up
with
new
regulations
prior
to
september
1.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
i
believe
that
there
was
in
the
original
complaint
not
into
this,
in
the
original
complaint.
so
there
were
four
original
complaints.
three
filed
from
san
clinton
and
one
filed
from
--
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
it
is
not
approved
class
action.
we
have
abandoned
it
–-
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
yes,
your
honor.
there
were
--
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
mr.
justice
white
i
think
you
are
referring
to
the
regulations
prohibiting
inmates
for
owning
not
loaning,
owning
personally
own
law
books.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
yes
that
is
what
--
california
still
prohibits
inmates
from
loaning
material
back
and
forth.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
it
was
an
issue
in
the
lower
court.
we
did
not
file
a
cross-appeal
because
judge
--
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
well,
only
insofar
as
its
part
of
the
basic
sub-stratum
of
the
whole
opinion.
this
is
not
a
case
just
having
to
do
with
law
books
and
this
is
access
to
the
court’s
over
the
whole
gambit
of
facilities
provided
by
the
state.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
i
believe,
your
honor
and
the
reason
i
say
i
believe
is
because
i
have
not
read
the
original
complaint
as
opposed
to
the
amended
complaint
for
a
long
time,
but
i
believe
that
they
alleged
specifically
that
the
denial
of
law
books
infringed
their
ability
to
file
post
conviction
petitions
and
actions
under
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871.
certainly
in
the
amended
complaint
we
did
so
allege.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
robert
--
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
robert
o.
gilmore
jr.
is
not
your
honor.
he
is
--
i
think
he
is
a
three
or
four
time
loser
from
--
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
he
may
have
attained
a
good
knowledge
of
law
over
the
years,
but
i
think
even
a
lawyer,
if
i
were
incarcerated
without
the
use
of
law
books
i
would
hate
to
rely
on
my
memory
because
my
memory
would
stop,
the
one
thing
as
of
the
moment
of
my
incarceration.
i
would
not
know
any
continuous
case.
the
appellees
say
they
have
the
money
to
provide
the
books,
but
first
of
all
we
have
not
decided
what
books
are
necessary.
if
for
instance
we
go
fairly
far
and
if
mr.
nock
and
i
were
to
have
this
task,
if
we
were
to
go
fairly
far
and
say
inmates
should
have
all
california
reports,
all
california
appellate
reports,
all
united
states
reports
and
all
federal
supplement
and
federal
second
reports
plus
the
text
that
had
already
been
allowed
plus
the
rules
of
the
district
court
on
so-called
on
federal
habeas
corpus.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
one
set
perhaps
in
each
prison.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
your
honor,
i
almost
have
to
go
back
to
the
kind
of
thinking
that
that
was
followed
by
this
court
before
you
overruled
bates
versus
brady.
in
each
case
where
somebody
comes
to
the
court
and
says
i
cannot
file
a
petition
because
there
are
no
law
books
necessary.
i
do
not
think
you
run
into
that
probably
because
i
think
that
if
you
order
that
of
if
you
affirm
this
order
i
do
not
think
there
will
be
extreme
difficulty
in
working
out
some
kind
of
a
library
as
part
of
that.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
no,
your
honor
it
is
not
specific
standard,
it
is
not
by
saying
these
reports
or
those
reports
or
these
courts.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
it
said
that
the
existing
list
was
inadequate
and
that
some
regulation
should
be
promulgated
which
will
provide
the
first
instance
petitioner
with
enough
access
through
the
law
to
allow
him
meaningful
access
to
the
courts
on
the
first
time
he
files
his
petition.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
your
honor,
the
way
the
state
law
library
works
--
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
no,
no
the
law
--
the
state
law
library
is
complete.
it
is
just
not
feasible.
each
inmate
is
allowed
to
send
in
a
postcard
asking
for
five
volumes
once
a
week
and
usually
gets
back
another
post
card
saying
they
are
all
out
and
they
are
not
circulation.
but
i
do
not
want
to
represent
that
as
a
fact
usually,
but
quite
often
this
happens.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
well,
your
honor
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
but
i
think
that
constitution
--
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
no,
i
do
not
want.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
i
do
not
think
we
reach
that
question
because
i
think
that
the
only
question
here
is
whether
this
order
which
requires,
which
asks
for
new
regulations
should
stand
or
fall
or
be
modified.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
yes,
your
honor
i
do.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
they
basically
ordered
the
state
to
come
up
with
new
regulation,
your
honor.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
well,
your
honor
they
did
not
require
books.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
they
pointed
out
three
examples
and
the
judges
said
of
course
the
alternatives
are
legend.
justice
white
suggested
one
which
has
never
been
discussed,
below
or
between
counsel
and
myself.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
there
is
legislation.
there
is
perspective
legislation
which
will
establish
a
state
wide
post
conviction
or
perhaps
not
all
post
convictions,
but
appellant
defense
core.
there
are
public
defenders
now
in
california,
but
in
a
number
of
counties,
but
this
public
defenders
only
represent
on
appeal
if
they
decide
the
appeal
is
worthwhile.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
not
to
my
knowledge.
the
america
--
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
that
is
correct.
i
think
that
it
would
be
cheaper
of
course
to
provide
law
books
in
prison
libraries
than
to
establish
a
state
wide
system
of
appellate
defendants,
but
of
course
varied
considerations
are
not
the
important
thing.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
not
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
they
have
had
some
attempts
to
take
students
out
to
the
prisons?
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
this
is
my
understanding
and
i
believe
it
has
not
passed
even
one
house
here.
i
believe
it
is
pending
in
the
senate.
i
am
not
sure.
your
honor
when
you
--
your
honors,
when
you
overruled
bates
versus
brady
in
1963
in
deciding
gideon,
a
great
number
of
the
kinds
of
problems
which
we
are
touching
on
here
were
urged
upon
you
by
the
state
of
florida
that
if
you
do
this
you
will
encourage
litigation
because
new
tools,
in
that
case
counsel
would
be
available,
be
made
available
to
many,
many
defendants
and
inmates.
that
there
be
an
enormous
burden
on
the
taxpayers
and
that
the
matter
would
create
myriad
and
complex
new
league
of
questions.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
i
think
that
the
effect
of
it
has
been
practical
--
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
well,
the
practical
of
that
in
this
case
i
think
would
be
therapeutic
and
educational.
it
is
much
better
to
let
inmates
try
to
get
out
of
prison
using
law
books
than
in
more
socially
unacceptable
ways.
the
psychological
effect
on
a
poor
man
who
cannot
have
more
than
the
12
books
which
the
executive
says
he
can
have
them
when
somebody
else
in
the
next
trial
has
14
lawyers
in
a
new
york
firm
working
on
his
case
is
rather
profound.
inmates
know
what
laymen
generally
know,
effective
access
to
the
courts
has
to
include
knowledge
of
the
law
through
some
kind
of
tool.
otherwise
there
is
no
need
for
the
bar.
there
will
just
be
a
need
for
the
bench.
if
you
put
the
duty
on
the
judge
of
protecting
the
rights
of
the
post
conviction
petitioners,
you
make
the
judge
an
advocate
and
i
think
that
the
inmate
has
to
have
knowledge
of
the
law
to
allege
facts,
i
will
not
touch
on
that
more
than
briefly.
he
does
not
know
what
facts
to
allege
unless
he
has
knowledge
of
the
law.
he
does
not
know
how
to
allege
the
facts
and
which
facts
are
not
relevant
or
material
at
all.
here
you
have
a
situation
where
california
makes
habeas
corpus
and
coram
nobis
available,
but
denies
their
effective
availability
to
propers
and
this
would
seem
to
violate
all
your
line
of
equal
protection
cases.
thank
you,
very
much.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
i
do
not
believe
we
put
them
in
justice
stewart
in
the
appendix
sir,
but
six
pages
of
the
note
8-1/2
x
11-1/2
paper
asking
various
questions.
the
question
about
the
facts
having
to
do
with
post-conviction
relief
say
briefly
allege
the
facts
which
you
question
like
this,
briefly
allege
the
facts
which
you
think
entitles
you
to
the
relief.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
i
am
sure
they
are
in
the
original
record.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
yes.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
they
are.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
yes
and
they
are
similar
in
nature.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
they
are
in
the
record,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
thank
you
for
your
appointment.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
about
tools
which
are
necessary
for
access
to
the
courts.
in
the
english
speaking
world
the
common
law
entries
for
history
of
development
of
tools
which
are
necessary
for
access
to
courts
has
been
a
history
wherein
the
executive
has
resisted
the
extension
and
the
granting
of
these
tools,
starting
with
the
great
struggle
to
achieve
the
great
writ
of
freedom,
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
highlighted
by
the
english
statute
in
1695
wherein
treason
defendants
were
allowed
to
have
counsel
at
the
trials.
before
1695,
neither
treason
nor
felony
defendants
of
course
could
have
counsel.
then
highlighted
by
our
own
sixth
amendment
because
at
that
time
in
england
even
felony
defendants
could
not
have
counsel,
they
did
not
get
the
right
to
counsel
until
1836.
finally
highlighted
by
our
great
line,
your
great
line
of
equal
protection
cases
rendering
rights
to
transcripts
and
counsel
beginning
perhaps
in
1956
with
griffin
versus
illinois
through
andrews
versus
california,
so
on
and
so
forth.
as
i
have
mentioned
the
executive
has
historically
resisted
the
making
available
tools
for
access
to
the
courts
and
we
believe
that
executive
branch
of
the
california
government
again
does
so
here
and
does
so
strongly
and
does
so
quite
ably
through
my
brother
nock.
we
concur
with
the
attorney
general
of
california
that
this
is
a
proper
case
to
be
heard
by
a
three-judge
court
and
the
three-judge
court
was
properly
convened.
we
think
the
strong
interest
of
the
california
government
even
resisting
the
order
of
granting
relief
which
came
from
that
three-judge
court
shows
that
this
is
the
kind
of
case
that
congress
had
in
mind
in
passing
section
2281
of
title
28.
this
regulation
which
was
promulgated
pursuant
to
authority
granted
by
the
california
penal
code,
by
the
california
director
of
corrections,
involves
the
legislative
policy
of
california.
section
5058
of
the
california
penal
code
allows
the
director
of
corrections
to
provide
regulations,
to
establish
regulations
for
the
government
of
the
california
prisons
and
the
change
from
at
his
pleasure
and
he
has
done
so
here
as
counsel
pointed
out.
in
september
of
1966,
five
years
ago,
he
promulgated
a
regulation
limiting
law
books
in
prison
libraries
to
12
named
law
books
with
which
you
are
familiar
from
counsel’s
argument.
he
also
incidentally
in
the
same
transmittal
letter
in
which
he
promulgated
that
regulation,
promulgated
an
additional
regulation
ordering
all
law
books
in
inmates'
personal
possession
removed
and
destroyed.
since
that
time
the
california
legislature
has
enacted
california
penal
code,
section
2600
which
allows
inmates
to
receive
and
own
law
books
in
their
own
cells.
but
the
restriction
and
this
is
the
whole
aspect
of
this
regulation
which
is
really
onerous,
the
restriction
of
prison
libraries
to
12
named
law
books
we
contend
violates
the
rights
of
indigent
inmates
and
only
indigent
inmates
to
access
to
the
courts,
it
is
an
integral
aspect
of
due
process
of
law
and
their
rights
to
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
not
that
it
was
not
cited
in
my
brief
mr.
justice
blackmun.
the
hatfield
case
i
think
supports
our
position
and
is
distinguishable
from
this
case
because
hatfield
had
to
do
with
the
regulations
involved
in
one
oregon
prison.
this
regulation
applies
statewide
to
all
california
prisons
and
penal
institutions.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
well,
no
sir,
but
i
believe
the
regulation
attack
there
was
a
time
space
and
method
regulation
in
one
particular
oregon
prison.
it
was
attacked
by
the
inmate
of
that
person.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
i
would
--
i
could
argue
either
way
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
i
do
not
think
the
case
is
a
good
case.
i
think
the
dictum
in
the
case
concerning,
first
stating
that
prison
authorities
have
no
obligation
to
provide
prisoners
with
opportunities
to
search
for
legal
loopholes
is
a
feeling
type
of
statement,
but
i
do
not
think
that
it
reaches
the
questions
which
we
reach
here
which
are
access
to
the
courts
in
due
process
of
law
access
to
the
courts
and
equal
protection
of
the
laws
with
regard
to
the
indigent
prisoners.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
yes,
your
honor,
justice
brennan.
the
section
2600
was
enacted,
i
believe
in
1969,
am
i
not
correct
counsel,
68.
after
this
case,
after
this
action
was
filed
and
after
we
had
obtained
a
temporary
restraining
order
which
although
it
is
almost
moot
at
this
point
remains
in
effect
by
stipulation
in
order
prohibiting
california
prison
officials
from
removing
books
from
inmate’s
cells.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
the
--
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
yes,
your
honor.
the
inmates
may
purchase
law
books
and
legal
opinions,
anything
that
is
allowed
to
pass
through
the
united
states
post
office
with
the
exemption
of
perhaps
matter
which
might
be
considered
obscene,
inflammatory,
this
is
--
perhaps
it
worry
out
in
that
regard,
but
subject
only
to
reasonable
limitations
concerning
space.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
the
best
tool
you
can
have,
if
you
want
to
go
in
the
court
is
a
lawyer,
it
is
the
best
way
you
can
get.
the
second
best
tool
if
you
cannot
afford
a
lawyer
is
access
to
the
law,
access
to
the
opinions,
to
the
substance,
to
the
procedural
writing
on
the
law.
i
think
the
inmate
that
is
very
wealthy
can
retain
counsel.
the
inmate
that
has
means,
but
not
quite
as
much
means
can
buy
law
books.
the
inmate
that
has
nothing
can
buy
nothing.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
yes,
he
may.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
the
indigent
may
not
or
cannot.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
this
is
the
most
difficult
question,
but
it
is
the
question
which
we
squarely
need.
i
think
that
you
do
no
have
to
give
inmates
obviously
benedict
on
admiralty.
this
is
extreme.
obviously
they
do
not
need
this.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
no,
your
honor.
they
should
not.
they
do
not
need
this.
they
should
have
what
they
need
for
meaningful
access
to
the
courts
on
the
personal
ground.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
i
would
say
--
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
in
the
argument
in
the
court
below
judge
zercoli
(ph)
asked
mr.
nock
and
myself
if
we
could
coordinate
on
establishing
a
list
of
law
books
for
california
prisons.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
i
think
he
only
asked
the
question,
your
honor
and
i
said
that
i
would
consider
this
one
of
the
most
weighty
responsibilities
that
anybody
could
have,
but
i
would
attempt
it
because
it
would
be
better
than
the
present
situation.
i
think
that
counsel
supports
our
position
that
additional
books
are
needed
in
his
brief.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
well,
he
does
not
say
that
the
–-
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
yes,
i
believe
though
that
when
he
admits
in
his
opening
brief
on
page
22,
the
three
additional
law
books
in
the
prison
libraries
giving
knowledge
of
venue,
jurisdiction,
proper
parties,
respondent
and
exhaustion
of
remedies
and
perhaps
hopefully
does
not
say
this
even
proper
remedies.
for
instance,
whether
it
should
be
a
petition
for
writ
of
coram
nobis
or
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
which
in
california
are
brought
in
different
courts.
petition
for
habeas
corpus
is
brought
in
the
courts
which
has
jurisdiction
over
the
county
in
which
the
prisoner
is
incarcerated.
petition
of
writ
of
coram
nobis
is
brought
in
the
court
where
the
petitioner
was
convicted.
he
admits
in
his
brief
that
three
more
books
would
give
the
use
procedural
or
this
procedural
law
make
it
available
to
the
prisoners.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
well,
your
honor
that
is
no
substitute
for
law
books.
if
it
is
--
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
i
put
very
little
value.
i
think
that
counsel’s
position
is
or
rather
the
state's
position
is
that
this
--
that
all
an
inmate
needs
to
do
is
allege
facts
on
a
blank,
on
his
blank
forms
and
hand
them
in
so
to
speak
and
the
courts
will
do
everything
that
is
necessary
to
ensure
that
the
inmate
gets
a
fair
hearing.
well,
this
is
impossible
by
the
number
of
petitions
that
are
filed.
the
inmate
who
files
a
post
conviction
petition
has
a
tremendous
burden
because
he
has
already
had
a
trial.
perhaps
he
has
had
an
appeal,
but
as
you
know
from
the
brief
of
amicus,
california
does
not
at
this
point
inform
inmates
or
who
have
been
convicted
that
they
have
a
right
to
an
appeal
and
a
right
to
counsel
on
appeal
immediately
after
their
appeal.
so
many
times
the
inmates'
first
shot
in
essence
an
substitute
for
an
appeal
is
a
petition
for
writ
of
coram
nobis
or
petition
for
habeas
corpus.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
in
general,
your
honor
and
i
cannot
speak
for
all
proceedings,
i
have
been
appointed
in
one
proceeding
myself
and
that
was
in
a
petition
for
writ
of
coram
nobis.
after
the
inmate
had
filed
his
petition
with
the
court
and
the
court
had
decided
that
this
petition
was
worthy
of
appointment
of
counsel
--
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
no
he
is
not,
he
is
not.
the
inmate
has
--
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
only
when
the
court
decides
there
is
some
substance
to
it.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
right.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
and
on
appeal.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
i
believe
it
is
true
throughout
the
state,
your
honor.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
a
counsel
may
be
appointed
pursuant
to
two
statutes
that
are
part
of
the
california
penal
code
for
trial
court
or
personal
proceedings
and
for
appellant
proceedings.
there
is
one
statute
that
covers
first
instance
appointment
and
one
statute
that
covers
an
appellant
point.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
i
am
sure
that
somebody
could
do
this,
but
it
would
have
to
be
more
than
a
handbook.
it
would
have
to
perhaps
a
book
with
a
supplement
and
the
supplement
--
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
yes.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
watkins
criminal
procedure
was
cited
by
counsel
earlier
and
i
was
fairly
certain,
but
i
checked
during
the
noon
hour
and
it
is
supplemented
every
two
years.
the
latest
supplement
in
your
library
upstairs
is
dated,
mr.
watkins
promulgating
letters
dated
january
15,
1970.
this
is
insufficient.
i
think
that
it
would
be
possible
justice
white
to
write,
publish
the
kind
of
book
you
are
talking
about
and
i
think
this
is
embraced
within
the
terms
of
the
three-judge
court’s
order.
the
three-judge
court
did
not
order
an
extensive
argumentation
of
prison
law
libraries.
it
left
the
whole
matter
open.
it
merely
ordered
the
state
to
come
up
with
new
regulations
prior
to
september
1.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
i
believe
that
there
was
in
the
original
complaint
not
into
this,
in
the
original
complaint.
so
there
were
four
original
complaints.
three
filed
from
san
clinton
and
one
filed
from
--
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
it
is
not
approved
class
action.
we
have
abandoned
it
–-
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
yes,
your
honor.
there
were
--
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
mr.
justice
white
i
think
you
are
referring
to
the
regulations
prohibiting
inmates
for
owning
not
loaning,
owning
personally
own
law
books.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
yes
that
is
what
--
california
still
prohibits
inmates
from
loaning
material
back
and
forth.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
it
was
an
issue
in
the
lower
court.
we
did
not
file
a
cross-appeal
because
judge
--
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
well,
only
insofar
as
its
part
of
the
basic
sub-stratum
of
the
whole
opinion.
this
is
not
a
case
just
having
to
do
with
law
books
and
this
is
access
to
the
court’s
over
the
whole
gambit
of
facilities
provided
by
the
state.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
i
believe,
your
honor
and
the
reason
i
say
i
believe
is
because
i
have
not
read
the
original
complaint
as
opposed
to
the
amended
complaint
for
a
long
time,
but
i
believe
that
they
alleged
specifically
that
the
denial
of
law
books
infringed
their
ability
to
file
post
conviction
petitions
and
actions
under
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871.
certainly
in
the
amended
complaint
we
did
so
allege.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
robert
--
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
robert
o.
gilmore
jr.
is
not
your
honor.
he
is
--
i
think
he
is
a
three
or
four
time
loser
from
--
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
he
may
have
attained
a
good
knowledge
of
law
over
the
years,
but
i
think
even
a
lawyer,
if
i
were
incarcerated
without
the
use
of
law
books
i
would
hate
to
rely
on
my
memory
because
my
memory
would
stop,
the
one
thing
as
of
the
moment
of
my
incarceration.
i
would
not
know
any
continuous
case.
the
appellees
say
they
have
the
money
to
provide
the
books,
but
first
of
all
we
have
not
decided
what
books
are
necessary.
if
for
instance
we
go
fairly
far
and
if
mr.
nock
and
i
were
to
have
this
task,
if
we
were
to
go
fairly
far
and
say
inmates
should
have
all
california
reports,
all
california
appellate
reports,
all
united
states
reports
and
all
federal
supplement
and
federal
second
reports
plus
the
text
that
had
already
been
allowed
plus
the
rules
of
the
district
court
on
so-called
on
federal
habeas
corpus.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
one
set
perhaps
in
each
prison.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
your
honor,
i
almost
have
to
go
back
to
the
kind
of
thinking
that
that
was
followed
by
this
court
before
you
overruled
bates
versus
brady.
in
each
case
where
somebody
comes
to
the
court
and
says
i
cannot
file
a
petition
because
there
are
no
law
books
necessary.
i
do
not
think
you
run
into
that
probably
because
i
think
that
if
you
order
that
of
if
you
affirm
this
order
i
do
not
think
there
will
be
extreme
difficulty
in
working
out
some
kind
of
a
library
as
part
of
that.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
no,
your
honor
it
is
not
specific
standard,
it
is
not
by
saying
these
reports
or
those
reports
or
these
courts.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
it
said
that
the
existing
list
was
inadequate
and
that
some
regulation
should
be
promulgated
which
will
provide
the
first
instance
petitioner
with
enough
access
through
the
law
to
allow
him
meaningful
access
to
the
courts
on
the
first
time
he
files
his
petition.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
your
honor,
the
way
the
state
law
library
works
--
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
no,
no
the
law
--
the
state
law
library
is
complete.
it
is
just
not
feasible.
each
inmate
is
allowed
to
send
in
a
postcard
asking
for
five
volumes
once
a
week
and
usually
gets
back
another
post
card
saying
they
are
all
out
and
they
are
not
circulation.
but
i
do
not
want
to
represent
that
as
a
fact
usually,
but
quite
often
this
happens.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
well,
your
honor
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
but
i
think
that
constitution
--
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
no,
i
do
not
want.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
i
do
not
think
we
reach
that
question
because
i
think
that
the
only
question
here
is
whether
this
order
which
requires,
which
asks
for
new
regulations
should
stand
or
fall
or
be
modified.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
yes,
your
honor
i
do.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
they
basically
ordered
the
state
to
come
up
with
new
regulation,
your
honor.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
well,
your
honor
they
did
not
require
books.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
they
pointed
out
three
examples
and
the
judges
said
of
course
the
alternatives
are
legend.
justice
white
suggested
one
which
has
never
been
discussed,
below
or
between
counsel
and
myself.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
there
is
legislation.
there
is
perspective
legislation
which
will
establish
a
state
wide
post
conviction
or
perhaps
not
all
post
convictions,
but
appellant
defense
core.
there
are
public
defenders
now
in
california,
but
in
a
number
of
counties,
but
this
public
defenders
only
represent
on
appeal
if
they
decide
the
appeal
is
worthwhile.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
not
to
my
knowledge.
the
america
--
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
that
is
correct.
i
think
that
it
would
be
cheaper
of
course
to
provide
law
books
in
prison
libraries
than
to
establish
a
state
wide
system
of
appellate
defendants,
but
of
course
varied
considerations
are
not
the
important
thing.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
not
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
they
have
had
some
attempts
to
take
students
out
to
the
prisons?
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
this
is
my
understanding
and
i
believe
it
has
not
passed
even
one
house
here.
i
believe
it
is
pending
in
the
senate.
i
am
not
sure.
your
honor
when
you
--
your
honors,
when
you
overruled
bates
versus
brady
in
1963
in
deciding
gideon,
a
great
number
of
the
kinds
of
problems
which
we
are
touching
on
here
were
urged
upon
you
by
the
state
of
florida
that
if
you
do
this
you
will
encourage
litigation
because
new
tools,
in
that
case
counsel
would
be
available,
be
made
available
to
many,
many
defendants
and
inmates.
that
there
be
an
enormous
burden
on
the
taxpayers
and
that
the
matter
would
create
myriad
and
complex
new
league
of
questions.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
i
think
that
the
effect
of
it
has
been
practical
--
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
well,
the
practical
of
that
in
this
case
i
think
would
be
therapeutic
and
educational.
it
is
much
better
to
let
inmates
try
to
get
out
of
prison
using
law
books
than
in
more
socially
unacceptable
ways.
the
psychological
effect
on
a
poor
man
who
cannot
have
more
than
the
12
books
which
the
executive
says
he
can
have
them
when
somebody
else
in
the
next
trial
has
14
lawyers
in
a
new
york
firm
working
on
his
case
is
rather
profound.
inmates
know
what
laymen
generally
know,
effective
access
to
the
courts
has
to
include
knowledge
of
the
law
through
some
kind
of
tool.
otherwise
there
is
no
need
for
the
bar.
there
will
just
be
a
need
for
the
bench.
if
you
put
the
duty
on
the
judge
of
protecting
the
rights
of
the
post
conviction
petitioners,
you
make
the
judge
an
advocate
and
i
think
that
the
inmate
has
to
have
knowledge
of
the
law
to
allege
facts,
i
will
not
touch
on
that
more
than
briefly.
he
does
not
know
what
facts
to
allege
unless
he
has
knowledge
of
the
law.
he
does
not
know
how
to
allege
the
facts
and
which
facts
are
not
relevant
or
material
at
all.
here
you
have
a
situation
where
california
makes
habeas
corpus
and
coram
nobis
available,
but
denies
their
effective
availability
to
propers
and
this
would
seem
to
violate
all
your
line
of
equal
protection
cases.
thank
you,
very
much.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
i
do
not
believe
we
put
them
in
justice
stewart
in
the
appendix
sir,
but
six
pages
of
the
note
8-1/2
x
11-1/2
paper
asking
various
questions.
the
question
about
the
facts
having
to
do
with
post-conviction
relief
say
briefly
allege
the
facts
which
you
question
like
this,
briefly
allege
the
facts
which
you
think
entitles
you
to
the
relief.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
i
am
sure
they
are
in
the
original
record.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
yes.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
they
are.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
yes
and
they
are
similar
in
nature.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
they
are
in
the
record,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
eshleman
wahl
thank
you
for
your
appointment.
