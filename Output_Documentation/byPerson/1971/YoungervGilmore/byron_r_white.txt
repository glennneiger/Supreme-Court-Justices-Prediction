justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
they
--
an
inmate
purchases
one
volume
of
united
states
reports
that
he
wants,
can
he
buy
one?
let
us
assume
he
has
the
money
and
he
orders
it
from
the
government
printing
office?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
anybody
who
has
the
money
can
have
an
fairly
adequate
law
library
available
to
him
alone?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
place
is
available,
but
if
he
could
buy
a
textbook
on
the
separation
of
petitions
for
habeas
corpus
which
would
not
be
available
neither
at
prison
or
the
state
law
library
let
us
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
he
could
have
it
himself?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
could
loan
it
to
anybody?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
regulation
about
hard
covers
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you
about
the
(inaudible)
orders
upon
--
at
what
stage
in
final
relief
proceeding
an
attorney
(inaudible)
california
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
counsel
is
not
automatically
defined
in
the
collateral
proceedings
immediately
from
the
filing
of
the
petition?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
(voice
overlap)
court
decides
that
there
is
substance
to
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
counsel
is
appointed?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
you
can
adjust
the
proceeding
in
the
lower
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
on
appeal?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
under
a
statute
or
a
court
rule
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
with
some
effort
it
might
take
a
year
and
so
you
and
someone
else
could
make
up
a
handbook
on
habeas
corpus
with
the
forms
and
some
fundamental
ground
rules
that
would
be
adequate
in
your
terms
to
guide
an
indigent
prisoner?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
what
i
mean,
a
loose
(inaudible)
would
be
kept
for
today?
justice
byron
r.
white
fundamental
rules
book?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
what
does
in
your
position
or
the
findings
of
the
three-judge
court,
anything
that
show
that
any
of
the
named
plaintiffs
have
the
disadvantage
to
the
trial
with
respect
to
the
regulations
that
they
are
now
talking
about,
namely
they
(inaudible)
had
wanted
to
file
or
were
in
the
concept
of
filing
and
that
they
have
been
denied
the
books
that
they
needed.
is
there
any
showing
of
any
specific
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
a
class
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
are
talking
about
the
main
parties?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
these
regulations
on
these
people
aside
from
the
restrictions
which
apparently
points
out
the
case
on
the
regulation
of
loaning
of
equal
material
and
one
person
to
another
or
is
there
any
(inaudible)
to
help
us?
justice
byron
r.
white
right
and
i
would
like
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
an
issue
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
is
not
an
issue
before
us?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
do
not
see
anything
in
front
of
the
district
court
showing
at
least
particular
plaintiffs
together
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
after
all
you
do
not
need
to
teach
your
plaintiff,
it
must
be
learned
lawyer?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible),
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
existing
list
adequate?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
none
of
these
things
on
the
list
would
satisfy
because
they
are
having
that
position?
the
state
law
library
--
justice
byron
r.
white
with
the
access?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
any
county
of
the
state
has
legal
aid,
the
body
or
public
defender
or
something
like
that
who
is
available
at
all
to
a
prisoner
who
wants
to
file
a
petition?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
no
some
public
defender
who
is
present
to
extend
to
answering
any
call
for
help
if
a
prisoner
wants
to
file
a
petition?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
you
get
through
with
the
body
of
petition
or
maybe
these
people
will
have
lawyers?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
say
that
proposed
legislation
looks
forward
to
this
area?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
there
is
no
question
this
is
a
state
wide
application?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
is
the
order
of
the
(inaudible)
administrator
authorized
by
statute
to
propound
the
regulation?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
are
there
plenty
of
cases
in
this
court
which
denies
the
three-judge
court
in
particular?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
they
file
officially
adequate
decision
in
the
higher
court
in
california
appoints?
