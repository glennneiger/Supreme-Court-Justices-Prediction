justice

stewart
could
your
--
could
your
client
come
under
any
of
these?
justice
potter
stewart
the
problem
i
have
is
this.
now,
your
--
your
brother
on
the
other
side
says
--
he
tells
us
that
because
of
the
enactment
of
this
--
the
legislation
of
this
case
is
nowhere
--
no
longer
worthy
of
consideration
by
this
court
on
certiorari
because
congressional
statute
has
now
cleared
the
matter
up.
but
putting
that
point
to
one
side,
you
tell
us
that
federal
law
be
applicable
and
hasn't
congress,
and
by
that
statute
declared
what
the
federal
law
is.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
does
follow
as
mr.
--
my
brother
rehnquist
--
the
question
suggest
then
that
your
ultimate
claim
is
that
that
statute
is
unconstitutional
or
if
the
--
if
the
statute
had
been
in
existence
at
the
time
that
your
claim
arose,
you
would
still
be
making
your
constitutional
claim
and
the
--
and
it
would
be
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
an
absolute
claim
if
the
statute
wasn't
constitutionally
inadequate.
justice
potter
stewart
wouldn't
that
be
true?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
anything
in
the
record
here
that
shows
the
relationship
between
the
deceased
serviceman
and
his
father?
other
than
that
they
were
father
and
son?
did
it
show
any
particular
dependency
or
lack
of
it?
