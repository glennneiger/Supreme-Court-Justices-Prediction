mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
felton
jenkins
from
atlanta,
georgia
and
i
represent
the
respondent,
the
prudential
insurance
company
of
america
in
this
case.
mr.
leverett
i
think
has
fairly
stated
the
facts
that
are
involved
here.
there
are
however,
two
points
that
i
would
like
to
make
just
so
i'm
certain
that
the
court
understands.
it's
not
clear
from
the
record
before
this
court
that
the
petitioner
here
is
in
fact
the
illegitimate
son
of
the
deceased
serviceman.
as
was
pointed
out,
there's
no
written
or
public
acknowledgement.
there's
no
father
listed
on
birth
certificate
and
the
records
of
the
social
security
administration
and
the
veterans
administration
do
not
show
that
petitioner
has
been
recognized
as
the
son
of
this
deceased
serviceman
at
least
so
far
as
this
record
is
concerned.
and
we
do
not
contend
that
he's
not
the
illegitimate
son.
we
just
want
to
point
out
if
there
is
some
question
of
fact
on
that
point.
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
the
georgia
trial
court
found
that
he
was
and
the
georgia
--
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
yes,
sir,
it
--
it
was.
the
second
point
that
i
wanted
to
make
is
--
concerns
the
question
which
is
before
this
court.
it's
been
stated
in
the
briefs
i
think
that
the
question
is
the
meaning
of
the
word
“child
or
children”
in
the
servicemen's
group
life
insurance
act.
and
that
is
in
fact
the
ultimate
question
that
has
to
be
decided
but
the
specific
question
before
the
court
so
prudential
contends
is
whether
or
not
reference
should
be
made
to
state
law
to
determine
the
meaning
of
that
term.
that
prudential
does
not
contend
that
--
i
want
to
make
this
clear
to
the
court
that
we
do
not
contend
that
in
every
situation
the
word
“child”
does
not
include
illegitimates.
all
we
are
saying
is
that
reference
should
be
made
to
state
law
and
then
the
law
of
that
particular
state
might
or
--
or
would
govern.
of
course
this
was
pointed
out
in
california,
an
illegitimate
would
be
entitled
to
--
to
the
proceeds,
so
we
do
not
contend
that
--
that
that
is
the
issue
here.
now,
there
are
three
points
that
i'd
like
to
try
to
cover
in
my
argument
basically
that
have
been
discussed
by
mr.
leverett.
the
first
point
is
we
contend
that
the
writ
of
certiorari
should
be
dismissed
as
having
been
improvidently
granted.
as
the
court
knows,
the
writ
was
granted
on
november
9th,
1971
and
approximately
a
month
later,
congress
adopted
this
1971
amendment.
now,
this
amendment
speaks
directly
to
the
question
which
is
before
the
court,
the
meaning
of
the
word
“child
children.”
the
amendment
specifically
takes
care
of
that
--
of
that
question.
and
that
question
just
simply
will
not
come
up
again.
and
mr.
leverett
has
raised
a
point
and
from
some
of
the
questions
from
the
court,
there
may
be
a
question
of
whether
that
1971
amendment
is
constitutional.
we
of
course
would
contend
that
it
is
constitutional
but
whether
it
is
or
not,
that's
not
a
question
which
is
before
the
court
in
this
case.
that
question
may
later
come
up.
and
it
--
it
very
easily
could,
i
--
i
guess
but
it's
not
before
the
court
here.
the
question
which
is
before
this
court
has
been
solved
--
has
been
resolved
by
this
1971
amendment
and
that
question
simply
will
not
come
up
again.
and
we've
cited
in
our
brief
the
case
of
rice
versus
sioux
city
and
it's
quoted
in
our
brief.
and
it
also
have
several
passages
quoted
from
the
case
and
no
need
to
--
to
take
the
court's
time
by
going
in
to
that.
mr.
leverett
mentioned
the
case
of
jones
versus
mayer
company.
he
contends
that
that
case
in
effect
goes
against
the
rice
case
and
shows
that
this
court
shouldn't
go
in
and
consider
this
question.
but
in
that
jones
case,
there
was
a
question
of
the
interpretation
of
whites
under
42
u.s.c.
section
1982
and
that
concern
the
refusal
of
--
to
sell
a
home
or
rent
an
apartment
on
the
basis
of
race.
and
while
that
case
was
being
considered,
congress
adopted
the
civil
rights
act
of
1968.
and
the
court
held
that
it
should
go
ahead
and
consider
the
case
which
was
before
it
because
the
1968
act
had
no
effect
on
this
section
which
was
under
consideration
by
the
court,
the
1982
section.
of
course
here,
congress
--
the
--
the
act
that
congress
has
adopted,
the
1971
amendment,
speaks
directly
to
the
question
which
is
before
this
court.
it
defines
the
very
term
which
this
court
is
asked
to
consider
in
this
case.
for
those
reasons,
we
feel
that
the
writ
should
be
dismissed
as
having
been
improvidently
granted.
the
second
point
that
we
would
like
to
make
concerns
the
question
of
reference
to
state
law.
obviously,
we
rely
on
the
case
of
desylva
versus
ballentine.
that
case
of
course
does
involve
the
federal
copyright
act.
it
does
not
involve
an
act
dealing
with
servicemen.
but
we
don't
feel
that
that's
any
distinction.
now,
petitioner
has
tried
to
distinguish
the
case
on
two
grounds.
he
says
that
the
copyright
act
deals
only
with
the
creation
of
literary
and
artistic
rights
or
the
passing
on
of
those
rights.
but
--
but
this
court's
opinion
at
page
582
of
that
decision
pointed
out
that
the
evident
purpose
of
this
section
24
which
was
under
consideration
in
that
case
is
to
provide
for
the
office
family
after
his
death.
the
very
same
question
or
very
same
purpose
that
petitioner
contends
the
servicemen's
group
life
insurance
act
that
--
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
it
--
it
could
very
easily
--
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
that
--
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
well,
as
i
pointed
out
initially
it's
not
clear
in
our
position.
we
don't
contend
he's
not
the
child,
we
simply
say
that
there's
a
question
of
fact
on
that
--
on
that
point.
simply
because
there
has
been
no
written
acknowledgement,
no
father
was
listed
on
the
birth
certificate,
there's
been
no
judicial
determination
of
--
of
that
fact.
and
one
thing
i
might
mention
here
--
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
sir.
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
well,
under
the
1971
amendment,
i
--
i
don't
know
whether
they
would
fall
under
any
of
the
categories
or
not
--
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
yes,
sir.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
right.
well,
now
i
think
the
--
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
well,
now
that's
--
mr.
leverett
makes
that
position.
and
i've
--
i
don't
know
whether
i
want
to
agree
with
or
not.
one
of
the
categories
here
if
he
has
been
judicially
ordered
to
contribute
to
the
child's
support,
well
i
guess
that
couldn't
happen
after
his
death.
i
think
i
would
have
to
agree
with
him,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
in
this
case
he
would
fall
under
any
of
the
categories,
once
the
deceased
serviceman
died.
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
i
don't
think
so
under
the
meaning
of
this
act.
i
guess
at
that
point,
you'd
have
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation.
by
just
from
reading
the
act,
i
--
i
don't
think
that
a
situation
like
that
would
be
covered
under
the
terms
of
--
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
that
--
that's
--
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
right.
that
--
i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor,
under
the
wording
of
this
--
of
this
statute.
but
again,
you
might
get
back
into
the
constitutional
argument
that
mr.
leverett
says
is
present
that
this
1971
amendment
is
unconstitutional.
but
here
again,
that
question
is
not
before
the
court
in
this
case.
it
may
conceivably
come
up
at
some
point
but
it
is
not
before
the
court
in
--
in
this
case.
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
no.
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
but
the
person
down
the
line,
yes,
sir.
i'm
sure
that
person
would
--
would
certainly
have
some
objection
to
it.
back
to
the
desylva
versus
ballentine
decision,
we
simply
say
that
there's
no
real
difference
between
federal
copyright
act
and
the
servicemen's
group
life
insurance
act.
they
both
have
basically
the
same
purposes.
the
other
point
is
mr.
leverett
has
always
contended
that
the
servicemen's
group
life
insurance
act
has
its
purpose
to
look
after
the
people
who
were
dependent
on
the
deceased
serviceman
or
lets
a
little
bit
falls
in
the
--
the
deceased
serviceman
can
name
anyone
that
he
wants
to,
to
receive
the
benefits
under
that
policy.
he
could
name
--
doesn't
have
to
name
anyone
who's
a
member
of
his
family.
under
the
old
national
service
life
insurance
act,
the
serviceman
could
name
someone
that
he
wanted
to
but
he
had
to
name
someone
within
a
--
within
his
family.
they
were
specific
categories
that
he
could
not
go
outside
of.of
course
in
this
case,
he
could
name
anyone
he
wanted.
our
point
is
there's
just
no
real
difference
between
the
federal
copyright
act
and
the
servicemen's
group
life
insurance
act.
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
or
anyone
he
wanted
to,
yes
sir.
that's
correct.
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
it
does.
the
--
the
deposition
of
the
father
was
taken
and
the
--
the
son
lived
in
his
father's
home
up
until
the
time
he
left
to
go
in
the
service.
i
--
i
don't
think
there
was
anything
specific
on
--
on
that
point.
the
--
the
next
point
that
i'd
like
to
make
is
this
question
of
congressional
intent.
obviously,
when
congress
makes
some
comments
about
the
intent
of
an
act,
after
it's
passed,
it's
not
as
strong
as
those
comments
would
have
been
had
they
been
made
at
the
time
the
act
was
passed.
but
when
you
look
into
a
congressional
intent,
you
try
to
find
whatever
you
can.
and
very
clearly
when
the
court
adopted
this
--
this
1971
amendment,
they
spoke
directly
to
that
question
and
they've
said
that
presumably,
under
the
old
law,
we
must
look
to
--
to
state
law
and
of
course
on
the
floor
of
the
house
of
representatives,
the
same
--
the
same
comment
was
made.
and
i
can't
argue
with
mr.
leverett
on
the
point
that's
not
as
strong
--
an
indication
of
congressional
intent
as
would
be
present
if
that
--
if
those
same
comments
had
been
made
back
in
1965.
but
here
again,
we
--
we
have
to
look
to
--
to
what
we
have.
in
any
event
--
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
i
--
but
--
you
mean
if
he
named
the
--
the
child?
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
right,
he
just
checked
that
block
that
says
to
follow
in
accordance
to
the
precedence
set
forth
in
the
law.
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
told
my
answer
to
that.
under
the
form,
he
should
not
make
that
designation.
there's
a
block
to
check
that
he
wants
it
to
go
in
accordance
with
the
precedence
set
forth
in
the
law
and
if
he
doesn't
there,
the
next
line
down
says
name,
relationship,
something
of
that
nature.
so
he
should
to
know
to
write
in
that
name.
now,
you
have
another
question
of
his
intent
if
he
just
put
down
the
word
children.
because
there
again,
i
think
you
probably
would
look
to
what
does
the
word
child
mean?
and
you'd
--
you'd
be
right
back
into
state
law
under
this
the
desylva
versus
ballentine.
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
i
don't
--
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
that's
a
question
that
i
don't
really
know
the
answer
so
i
think
that
--
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
--
they
would
not.
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
well,
no,
really
it
doesn't.
and
if
the
serviceman
did
it,
i
guess
this
--
supposedly
he's
got
a
sargent
or
someone
there
over
and
telling
him
how
to
fill
out
the
form
and
he
shouldn't
fill
out
that
way.
that
would
be
--
he
would
have
filled
out
the
form
incorrectly.
but
if
--
if
he
did
it,
i
would
think
that
the
children
in
that
situation
would
not
be
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
the
policy.
that's
--
i'm
not
trying
to
avoid
your
question
but
that's
a
question
that's
not
in
this
case,
and
to
be
honest
with
the
court,
i
--
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
it
specifically.
we
come
now
to
the
question
of
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
due
process
and
equal
protection
clause.
the
court's
heard
a
good
bit
of
argument
today
on
that
point
in
view
of
the
louisiana
case
which
preceded
this
case.
and
i
don't
want
to
re-plow
all
of
that
ground.
obviously,
we
contend
that
the
decision
of
this
court
in
labine
versus
vincent
controls
the
situation
here.
of
course
in
that
case,
the
question
was
the
interpretation
of
the
louisiana
intestate
succession
statute,
and
the
court
held
that
states
had
to
right
to
make
a
distinction
between
legitimate
and
illegitimate
children
in
that
--
in
that
situation.
and
the
court
distinguished
the
labine
situation
from
the
situation
present
in
--
in
levy
and
glona
which
were
decided
a
couple
of
years
before.
obviously,
we
contend
that
we've
come
within
the
decision
by
this
court
in
--
in
labine.
there
are
--
are
two
things,
however,
i
think
that
i
--
i
would
like
to
point
out
on
this
--
on
this
question.
the
present
case,
this
--
this
case
here
presents
really
a
stronger
situation
toward
holding
that
the
act
is
not
an
--
or
--
or
that
designation
of
distinction
is
not
unconstitutional
than
was
present
in
either
levy
or
the
labine
case
or
the
--
the
louisiana
stokes
case
which
preceded
this
case.
in
all
of
those
three
cases,
there
were
some
impediments.
now,
the
court
has
used
the
term
barrier,
an
insurmountable
barrier.
and
i
suppose
if
you
really
look
at
those
cases
maybe
the
barrier
is
not
insurmountable.
there
are
certain
things
in
each
of
those
situations
that
--
that
could
be
done
but
there
is
some
barrier
in
each
of
them.
in
levy,
for
example,
the
tortfeasor
could
go
free
if
there
were
no
one
there
to
prosecute
the
action.
in
labine,
the
father
could
not
give
the
illegitimate
his
full
estate.
he
was
limited
to
only
one
third
or
one
fourth.
and
in
the
stokes
case
which
this
court
heard
this
morning,
the
father
could
not
even
acknowledge
the
--
the
child
under
louisiana
law
as
being
his
child.
now,
in
this
case,
none
of
those
impediments
are
present.
the
serviceman
here
could
simply
have
named
anyone
that
he
wanted
to
and
could
have
named
that
illegitimate
child
to
receive
the
full
$10,000.
there
is
no
barrier
whatsoever
here.
so
--
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
well,
it's
a
group
policy
and
it's
issued
to
the
veterans
administration.
i'm
not
sure
of
the
date
of
it.
i
guess
back
in
1965.
the
form
that
this
serviceman
signed
--
he
signed
in
--
in
may
of
1969,
i
guess
or
--
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
--
1967,
excuse
me.
and
then
the
child
was
born
in
june
of
--
of
that
same
year.
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
i
don't
think
the
record
shows
that
--
well,
no,
it
does
because
he
was
on
his
basic
training,
that's
right.
and
--
and
he
had
--
had
come
home
for
some
time.
i'm
not
sure
of
the
exact
time
that
he
came
home.
he
then
went
to
vietnam
as
i
recall
the
way
he
was
killed.
but
--
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
--
i
hesitate
and
i'm
not
absolutely
certain
on
that
point
but
i
--
i
think
that
is
correct.
in
any
event,
he
knew
about
the
child
before
he
died,
he
came
home
and
said
he
saw
the
child.
he
also
wrote
some
letters
making
reference
to
the
child
so
he
clearly
knew
about
the
child
and
could
have
made
that
--
that
designation
had
he
wanted
to.
so
first
of
all,
we
--
we
contend
that
this
case
is
a
stronger
case
than
any
of
these
other
three
cases.
and
the
next
point
is
that
there
is
a
reason
for
the
distinction
between
legitimates
and
illegitimates.
and
that's
really
the
thing
that
--
that
the
court
has
looked
to
and
--
and
i
guess
should
look
to
as
whether
or
not
there's
any
reasonable
basis
for
making
this
distinction.
and
obviously
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
--
in
the
labine
case,
the
reason
for
the
distinction
is
to
encourage
the
family
unit
to
strengthen
the
family
unit.
we
might
disagree
and
obviously,
some
people
do
with
the
--
the
merits
of
doing
this
to
further
the
family
unit.
but
that's
not
the
purpose
of
--
of
the
court
to
try
to
--
to
say,
“this
is
--
this
is
a
bad
thing
or
this
is
a
good
thing."
the
court
held
in
labine
that
this
was
a
decision
that
the
court
--
that
--
that
or
that
the
individual
states
could
make.
and
for
that
reason,
we
submit
that
there
is
a
valid
reason,
a
valid
distinction
for
--
for
distinguishing
between
legitimate
and
illegitimate
children.
in
closing,
i
just
like
to
emphasize
again
that
prudential
feels
strongly
that
this
is
not
a
case
which
the
court
should
decide
in
view
of
this
1971
amendment.
we
feel
that
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
all
of
the
issues
which
are
before
the
court
in
this
case
have
been
solved
by
that
1971
amendment.
that
1971
amendment
may
raise
some
additional
problems
but
those
problems
are
not
before
the
court
in
this
case.
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
yes,
sir.
that's
--
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
that's
my
understanding
of
--
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
that's
--
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
--
that's
spelled
out
in
the
act.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
felton
jenkins
from
atlanta,
georgia
and
i
represent
the
respondent,
the
prudential
insurance
company
of
america
in
this
case.
mr.
leverett
i
think
has
fairly
stated
the
facts
that
are
involved
here.
there
are
however,
two
points
that
i
would
like
to
make
just
so
i'm
certain
that
the
court
understands.
it's
not
clear
from
the
record
before
this
court
that
the
petitioner
here
is
in
fact
the
illegitimate
son
of
the
deceased
serviceman.
as
was
pointed
out,
there's
no
written
or
public
acknowledgement.
there's
no
father
listed
on
birth
certificate
and
the
records
of
the
social
security
administration
and
the
veterans
administration
do
not
show
that
petitioner
has
been
recognized
as
the
son
of
this
deceased
serviceman
at
least
so
far
as
this
record
is
concerned.
and
we
do
not
contend
that
he's
not
the
illegitimate
son.
we
just
want
to
point
out
if
there
is
some
question
of
fact
on
that
point.
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
the
georgia
trial
court
found
that
he
was
and
the
georgia
--
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
yes,
sir,
it
--
it
was.
the
second
point
that
i
wanted
to
make
is
--
concerns
the
question
which
is
before
this
court.
it's
been
stated
in
the
briefs
i
think
that
the
question
is
the
meaning
of
the
word
“child
or
children”
in
the
servicemen's
group
life
insurance
act.
and
that
is
in
fact
the
ultimate
question
that
has
to
be
decided
but
the
specific
question
before
the
court
so
prudential
contends
is
whether
or
not
reference
should
be
made
to
state
law
to
determine
the
meaning
of
that
term.
that
prudential
does
not
contend
that
--
i
want
to
make
this
clear
to
the
court
that
we
do
not
contend
that
in
every
situation
the
word
“child”
does
not
include
illegitimates.
all
we
are
saying
is
that
reference
should
be
made
to
state
law
and
then
the
law
of
that
particular
state
might
or
--
or
would
govern.
of
course
this
was
pointed
out
in
california,
an
illegitimate
would
be
entitled
to
--
to
the
proceeds,
so
we
do
not
contend
that
--
that
that
is
the
issue
here.
now,
there
are
three
points
that
i'd
like
to
try
to
cover
in
my
argument
basically
that
have
been
discussed
by
mr.
leverett.
the
first
point
is
we
contend
that
the
writ
of
certiorari
should
be
dismissed
as
having
been
improvidently
granted.
as
the
court
knows,
the
writ
was
granted
on
november
9th,
1971
and
approximately
a
month
later,
congress
adopted
this
1971
amendment.
now,
this
amendment
speaks
directly
to
the
question
which
is
before
the
court,
the
meaning
of
the
word
“child
children.”
the
amendment
specifically
takes
care
of
that
--
of
that
question.
and
that
question
just
simply
will
not
come
up
again.
and
mr.
leverett
has
raised
a
point
and
from
some
of
the
questions
from
the
court,
there
may
be
a
question
of
whether
that
1971
amendment
is
constitutional.
we
of
course
would
contend
that
it
is
constitutional
but
whether
it
is
or
not,
that's
not
a
question
which
is
before
the
court
in
this
case.
that
question
may
later
come
up.
and
it
--
it
very
easily
could,
i
--
i
guess
but
it's
not
before
the
court
here.
the
question
which
is
before
this
court
has
been
solved
--
has
been
resolved
by
this
1971
amendment
and
that
question
simply
will
not
come
up
again.
and
we've
cited
in
our
brief
the
case
of
rice
versus
sioux
city
and
it's
quoted
in
our
brief.
and
it
also
have
several
passages
quoted
from
the
case
and
no
need
to
--
to
take
the
court's
time
by
going
in
to
that.
mr.
leverett
mentioned
the
case
of
jones
versus
mayer
company.
he
contends
that
that
case
in
effect
goes
against
the
rice
case
and
shows
that
this
court
shouldn't
go
in
and
consider
this
question.
but
in
that
jones
case,
there
was
a
question
of
the
interpretation
of
whites
under
42
u.s.c.
section
1982
and
that
concern
the
refusal
of
--
to
sell
a
home
or
rent
an
apartment
on
the
basis
of
race.
and
while
that
case
was
being
considered,
congress
adopted
the
civil
rights
act
of
1968.
and
the
court
held
that
it
should
go
ahead
and
consider
the
case
which
was
before
it
because
the
1968
act
had
no
effect
on
this
section
which
was
under
consideration
by
the
court,
the
1982
section.
of
course
here,
congress
--
the
--
the
act
that
congress
has
adopted,
the
1971
amendment,
speaks
directly
to
the
question
which
is
before
this
court.
it
defines
the
very
term
which
this
court
is
asked
to
consider
in
this
case.
for
those
reasons,
we
feel
that
the
writ
should
be
dismissed
as
having
been
improvidently
granted.
the
second
point
that
we
would
like
to
make
concerns
the
question
of
reference
to
state
law.
obviously,
we
rely
on
the
case
of
desylva
versus
ballentine.
that
case
of
course
does
involve
the
federal
copyright
act.
it
does
not
involve
an
act
dealing
with
servicemen.
but
we
don't
feel
that
that's
any
distinction.
now,
petitioner
has
tried
to
distinguish
the
case
on
two
grounds.
he
says
that
the
copyright
act
deals
only
with
the
creation
of
literary
and
artistic
rights
or
the
passing
on
of
those
rights.
but
--
but
this
court's
opinion
at
page
582
of
that
decision
pointed
out
that
the
evident
purpose
of
this
section
24
which
was
under
consideration
in
that
case
is
to
provide
for
the
office
family
after
his
death.
the
very
same
question
or
very
same
purpose
that
petitioner
contends
the
servicemen's
group
life
insurance
act
that
--
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
it
--
it
could
very
easily
--
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
that
--
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
well,
as
i
pointed
out
initially
it's
not
clear
in
our
position.
we
don't
contend
he's
not
the
child,
we
simply
say
that
there's
a
question
of
fact
on
that
--
on
that
point.
simply
because
there
has
been
no
written
acknowledgement,
no
father
was
listed
on
the
birth
certificate,
there's
been
no
judicial
determination
of
--
of
that
fact.
and
one
thing
i
might
mention
here
--
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
sir.
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
well,
under
the
1971
amendment,
i
--
i
don't
know
whether
they
would
fall
under
any
of
the
categories
or
not
--
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
yes,
sir.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
right.
well,
now
i
think
the
--
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
well,
now
that's
--
mr.
leverett
makes
that
position.
and
i've
--
i
don't
know
whether
i
want
to
agree
with
or
not.
one
of
the
categories
here
if
he
has
been
judicially
ordered
to
contribute
to
the
child's
support,
well
i
guess
that
couldn't
happen
after
his
death.
i
think
i
would
have
to
agree
with
him,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
in
this
case
he
would
fall
under
any
of
the
categories,
once
the
deceased
serviceman
died.
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
i
don't
think
so
under
the
meaning
of
this
act.
i
guess
at
that
point,
you'd
have
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation.
by
just
from
reading
the
act,
i
--
i
don't
think
that
a
situation
like
that
would
be
covered
under
the
terms
of
--
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
that
--
that's
--
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
right.
that
--
i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor,
under
the
wording
of
this
--
of
this
statute.
but
again,
you
might
get
back
into
the
constitutional
argument
that
mr.
leverett
says
is
present
that
this
1971
amendment
is
unconstitutional.
but
here
again,
that
question
is
not
before
the
court
in
this
case.
it
may
conceivably
come
up
at
some
point
but
it
is
not
before
the
court
in
--
in
this
case.
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
no.
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
but
the
person
down
the
line,
yes,
sir.
i'm
sure
that
person
would
--
would
certainly
have
some
objection
to
it.
back
to
the
desylva
versus
ballentine
decision,
we
simply
say
that
there's
no
real
difference
between
federal
copyright
act
and
the
servicemen's
group
life
insurance
act.
they
both
have
basically
the
same
purposes.
the
other
point
is
mr.
leverett
has
always
contended
that
the
servicemen's
group
life
insurance
act
has
its
purpose
to
look
after
the
people
who
were
dependent
on
the
deceased
serviceman
or
lets
a
little
bit
falls
in
the
--
the
deceased
serviceman
can
name
anyone
that
he
wants
to,
to
receive
the
benefits
under
that
policy.
he
could
name
--
doesn't
have
to
name
anyone
who's
a
member
of
his
family.
under
the
old
national
service
life
insurance
act,
the
serviceman
could
name
someone
that
he
wanted
to
but
he
had
to
name
someone
within
a
--
within
his
family.
they
were
specific
categories
that
he
could
not
go
outside
of.of
course
in
this
case,
he
could
name
anyone
he
wanted.
our
point
is
there's
just
no
real
difference
between
the
federal
copyright
act
and
the
servicemen's
group
life
insurance
act.
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
or
anyone
he
wanted
to,
yes
sir.
that's
correct.
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
it
does.
the
--
the
deposition
of
the
father
was
taken
and
the
--
the
son
lived
in
his
father's
home
up
until
the
time
he
left
to
go
in
the
service.
i
--
i
don't
think
there
was
anything
specific
on
--
on
that
point.
the
--
the
next
point
that
i'd
like
to
make
is
this
question
of
congressional
intent.
obviously,
when
congress
makes
some
comments
about
the
intent
of
an
act,
after
it's
passed,
it's
not
as
strong
as
those
comments
would
have
been
had
they
been
made
at
the
time
the
act
was
passed.
but
when
you
look
into
a
congressional
intent,
you
try
to
find
whatever
you
can.
and
very
clearly
when
the
court
adopted
this
--
this
1971
amendment,
they
spoke
directly
to
that
question
and
they've
said
that
presumably,
under
the
old
law,
we
must
look
to
--
to
state
law
and
of
course
on
the
floor
of
the
house
of
representatives,
the
same
--
the
same
comment
was
made.
and
i
can't
argue
with
mr.
leverett
on
the
point
that's
not
as
strong
--
an
indication
of
congressional
intent
as
would
be
present
if
that
--
if
those
same
comments
had
been
made
back
in
1965.
but
here
again,
we
--
we
have
to
look
to
--
to
what
we
have.
in
any
event
--
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
i
--
but
--
you
mean
if
he
named
the
--
the
child?
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
right,
he
just
checked
that
block
that
says
to
follow
in
accordance
to
the
precedence
set
forth
in
the
law.
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
told
my
answer
to
that.
under
the
form,
he
should
not
make
that
designation.
there's
a
block
to
check
that
he
wants
it
to
go
in
accordance
with
the
precedence
set
forth
in
the
law
and
if
he
doesn't
there,
the
next
line
down
says
name,
relationship,
something
of
that
nature.
so
he
should
to
know
to
write
in
that
name.
now,
you
have
another
question
of
his
intent
if
he
just
put
down
the
word
children.
because
there
again,
i
think
you
probably
would
look
to
what
does
the
word
child
mean?
and
you'd
--
you'd
be
right
back
into
state
law
under
this
the
desylva
versus
ballentine.
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
i
don't
--
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
that's
a
question
that
i
don't
really
know
the
answer
so
i
think
that
--
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
--
they
would
not.
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
well,
no,
really
it
doesn't.
and
if
the
serviceman
did
it,
i
guess
this
--
supposedly
he's
got
a
sargent
or
someone
there
over
and
telling
him
how
to
fill
out
the
form
and
he
shouldn't
fill
out
that
way.
that
would
be
--
he
would
have
filled
out
the
form
incorrectly.
but
if
--
if
he
did
it,
i
would
think
that
the
children
in
that
situation
would
not
be
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
the
policy.
that's
--
i'm
not
trying
to
avoid
your
question
but
that's
a
question
that's
not
in
this
case,
and
to
be
honest
with
the
court,
i
--
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
it
specifically.
we
come
now
to
the
question
of
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
due
process
and
equal
protection
clause.
the
court's
heard
a
good
bit
of
argument
today
on
that
point
in
view
of
the
louisiana
case
which
preceded
this
case.
and
i
don't
want
to
re-plow
all
of
that
ground.
obviously,
we
contend
that
the
decision
of
this
court
in
labine
versus
vincent
controls
the
situation
here.
of
course
in
that
case,
the
question
was
the
interpretation
of
the
louisiana
intestate
succession
statute,
and
the
court
held
that
states
had
to
right
to
make
a
distinction
between
legitimate
and
illegitimate
children
in
that
--
in
that
situation.
and
the
court
distinguished
the
labine
situation
from
the
situation
present
in
--
in
levy
and
glona
which
were
decided
a
couple
of
years
before.
obviously,
we
contend
that
we've
come
within
the
decision
by
this
court
in
--
in
labine.
there
are
--
are
two
things,
however,
i
think
that
i
--
i
would
like
to
point
out
on
this
--
on
this
question.
the
present
case,
this
--
this
case
here
presents
really
a
stronger
situation
toward
holding
that
the
act
is
not
an
--
or
--
or
that
designation
of
distinction
is
not
unconstitutional
than
was
present
in
either
levy
or
the
labine
case
or
the
--
the
louisiana
stokes
case
which
preceded
this
case.
in
all
of
those
three
cases,
there
were
some
impediments.
now,
the
court
has
used
the
term
barrier,
an
insurmountable
barrier.
and
i
suppose
if
you
really
look
at
those
cases
maybe
the
barrier
is
not
insurmountable.
there
are
certain
things
in
each
of
those
situations
that
--
that
could
be
done
but
there
is
some
barrier
in
each
of
them.
in
levy,
for
example,
the
tortfeasor
could
go
free
if
there
were
no
one
there
to
prosecute
the
action.
in
labine,
the
father
could
not
give
the
illegitimate
his
full
estate.
he
was
limited
to
only
one
third
or
one
fourth.
and
in
the
stokes
case
which
this
court
heard
this
morning,
the
father
could
not
even
acknowledge
the
--
the
child
under
louisiana
law
as
being
his
child.
now,
in
this
case,
none
of
those
impediments
are
present.
the
serviceman
here
could
simply
have
named
anyone
that
he
wanted
to
and
could
have
named
that
illegitimate
child
to
receive
the
full
$10,000.
there
is
no
barrier
whatsoever
here.
so
--
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
well,
it's
a
group
policy
and
it's
issued
to
the
veterans
administration.
i'm
not
sure
of
the
date
of
it.
i
guess
back
in
1965.
the
form
that
this
serviceman
signed
--
he
signed
in
--
in
may
of
1969,
i
guess
or
--
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
--
1967,
excuse
me.
and
then
the
child
was
born
in
june
of
--
of
that
same
year.
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
i
don't
think
the
record
shows
that
--
well,
no,
it
does
because
he
was
on
his
basic
training,
that's
right.
and
--
and
he
had
--
had
come
home
for
some
time.
i'm
not
sure
of
the
exact
time
that
he
came
home.
he
then
went
to
vietnam
as
i
recall
the
way
he
was
killed.
but
--
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
--
i
hesitate
and
i'm
not
absolutely
certain
on
that
point
but
i
--
i
think
that
is
correct.
in
any
event,
he
knew
about
the
child
before
he
died,
he
came
home
and
said
he
saw
the
child.
he
also
wrote
some
letters
making
reference
to
the
child
so
he
clearly
knew
about
the
child
and
could
have
made
that
--
that
designation
had
he
wanted
to.
so
first
of
all,
we
--
we
contend
that
this
case
is
a
stronger
case
than
any
of
these
other
three
cases.
and
the
next
point
is
that
there
is
a
reason
for
the
distinction
between
legitimates
and
illegitimates.
and
that's
really
the
thing
that
--
that
the
court
has
looked
to
and
--
and
i
guess
should
look
to
as
whether
or
not
there's
any
reasonable
basis
for
making
this
distinction.
and
obviously
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
--
in
the
labine
case,
the
reason
for
the
distinction
is
to
encourage
the
family
unit
to
strengthen
the
family
unit.
we
might
disagree
and
obviously,
some
people
do
with
the
--
the
merits
of
doing
this
to
further
the
family
unit.
but
that's
not
the
purpose
of
--
of
the
court
to
try
to
--
to
say,
“this
is
--
this
is
a
bad
thing
or
this
is
a
good
thing."
the
court
held
in
labine
that
this
was
a
decision
that
the
court
--
that
--
that
or
that
the
individual
states
could
make.
and
for
that
reason,
we
submit
that
there
is
a
valid
reason,
a
valid
distinction
for
--
for
distinguishing
between
legitimate
and
illegitimate
children.
in
closing,
i
just
like
to
emphasize
again
that
prudential
feels
strongly
that
this
is
not
a
case
which
the
court
should
decide
in
view
of
this
1971
amendment.
we
feel
that
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
all
of
the
issues
which
are
before
the
court
in
this
case
have
been
solved
by
that
1971
amendment.
that
1971
amendment
may
raise
some
additional
problems
but
those
problems
are
not
before
the
court
in
this
case.
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
yes,
sir.
that's
--
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
that's
my
understanding
of
--
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
that's
--
mr.
a.
felton
jenkins,
jr.
--
that's
spelled
out
in
the
act.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
thank
you.
