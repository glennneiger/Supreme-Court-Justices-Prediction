justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
contending
then
that
conceivably,
the
application
of
the
new
act
of
congress
could
be
unconstitutional
in
some
circumstances?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
once
the
father
is
dead,
all
chances
of
coverage
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
under
that
amendment
disappear.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
it
is
true,
mr.
leverett,
isn't
it,
that
once
the
father
had
died
without
having
gone
through
some
acknowledgement
procedure
that
your
problems
of
proof
do
become
exacerbated?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
really,
it
--
it's
your
position
then
that
the
1971
amendment
far
from
broadening
the
construction
that
you
contend
governed
before
actually
narrowed
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
on
--
on
the
merits
of
your
argument
you're
arguing
that
the
federal
law
prior
to
the
1971
amendment
supports
recovery
by
your
client.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
then
we
look
at
the
1971
amendment
and
we
see
that
under
it,
your
client
could
not
recover.
so
we
must
assume
if
you're
right
as
to
what
the
federal
law
meant
before
that
the
1971
amendment
narrowed
the
definition
of
children,
rather
than
extend
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
this
particular
case,
mr.
leverett
the
--
the
proceeds
of
the
policy
were
paid
out,
were
they
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
he
black
or
white?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
the
georgia
trial
court
found
that
he
was.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
was
upheld
by
the
georgia
court
of
appeals.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
presumably,
even
if
your
client
were
to
admit
the
fact
that
the
--
the
petitioner
was
a
child,
you're
not
in
a
position
to
make
admissions
for
the
father
who
was
also
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
claiming
under
the
policy.
