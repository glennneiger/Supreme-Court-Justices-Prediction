don't
you
--
don't
you
--
i
thought
that
(inaudible)
statute
required
was
some
definitive
proof
of
parenthood?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice

making
in
the
--
in
this
very
litigation.
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
under
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
new
federal
statute,
it
is
not
enough
just
to
have
--
have
proof
of
parenthood?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
the
mother?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
for
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
testimony
of
the
mother?
i
mean
the
--
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
could
in
effect
then
--
congress
has
said
that
it's
not
a
denial
of
due
process
of
law
to
--
for
the
federal
government
or
for
the
federal
law
to
distinguish
between
unacknowledged
and
acknowledged
illegitimates.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
not
her
fault.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
fact,
this
language
didn't
make
that
contention.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
you
say
that
the
federal
law
controls
this
case,
where
--
and
as
my
brother
stewart
says
that,
where
do
you
find
the
federal
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
might
be
so,
i
--
i
just
put
the
federal
law
does.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
construe
the
word
“children”
in
this
insurance
policy?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
statute
says
the
word
“children”
would
not
include
and
acknowledge
illegitimates.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
do
with
desylva?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
not
a
matter
--
wasn't
that
a
question
of
whether
the
right
to
renew
a
copyright
descended
to
illegitimates
as
well
as
legitimate
children?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
--
would
you
--
if
this
case
came
up
today,
if
the
serviceman
died
today,
would
your
beneficiary
be
covered?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
could
a
--
what
could
an
appellate
court
do
when
it's
--
the
question
before
it
is
what
does
the
statute
mean?
what
does
the
word
“children”
include
and
pending
appeal,
there's
a
statute
that
says
what
it
means?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
should
the
appellate
court
take
the
law
as
it
is
when
the
case
is
decided
or
--
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
it
didn't
know.
what
if
the
law
was
changed
then
you
say
it
may
not
be
applied
retroactively,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
the
fact
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
if
i
ask
you
please,
under
the
federal
act
as
amended,
a
child
includes
an
illegitimate
child
under
certain
circumstances.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it's
not
that
the
word
“child”
doesn't
ever
include
illegitimate
children.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
--
it
sets
up
some
standards
for
approving
who
--
whether
--
whether
the
child
is
actually
a
child.
justice
byron
r.
white
has
it
been
denied
in
this
case
that
this
child
is
a
child
of
the
deceased
serviceman?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
if
i
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
it
were
admitted?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
that
they
didn't
and
that
an
addition,
that
the
--
the
aim
of
the
act
is
to
have
a
satisfactory
proof
of
whether
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
child
was
a
child.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
--
and
do
you
think
the
act
would
forbid
then
making
the
child
in
this
case
a
beneficiary
under
the
policy
even
though
the
insurance
company
defendant
admitted
that
he
was
a
child.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
wouldn't
make
a
difference
even
if
the
defendant
conceded
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
even
if
under
state
--
even
if
under
state
law
this
child
would
be
--
with
--
well
would
be
treated
as
a
child.
that's
a
statement
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
oral
acknowledgement
was
--
was
satisfactory
under
state
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
same
--
under
the
1971
act,
the
same
rule
would
apply
if
--
if
he
doesn't
make
beneficiaries
as
his
children?
if
he
just
says,
“my
children.”
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
problem
here
is
that
he
didn't
name
any
beneficiary.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
he
says,
“my
children?”
justice
byron
r.
white
when
was
the
--
when
was
the
policy
issued?
justice
byron
r.
white
1967.
justice
byron
r.
white
where
was
he
between
may
and
june?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
--
in
vietnam
after
the
child
was
born?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
under
the
1971
amendment
if
the
--
if
the
illegitimate
child
offers
proof
that
he
was
actually
a
child
of
the
dead
serviceman,
the
court
just
won't
hear
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
he
offers

offers
the
kind
of
