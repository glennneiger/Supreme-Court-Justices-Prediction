mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
granted
certiorari
in
this
case
to
review
a
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
holding
that
the
beneficiary
clause
of
the
servicemen's
life
insurance
act
of
1965
should
be
construed
according
to
georgia
law.
and
on
that
basis,
the
words
“child
or
children”
is
used
in
the
federal
act,
were
held
to
include
legitimate
children
only
and
to
exclude
the
illegitimate
children
of
a
deceased
serviceman.
this
case
commenced
with
the
filing
of
a
suit
in
the
superior
court
of
elbert
county,
georgia
in
july,
1969
against
the
prudential
insurance
company
of
america,
the
respondent,
seeking
recovery
of
the
$10,000
proceeds
of
a
policy
written
under
the
act.
at
the
time
of
filing
suit,
the
petitioner,
lorenzo
willis,
was
a
two-year-old,
illegitimate,
negro
son
of
a
15-year-old
mother,
janice
willis
and
a
20-year-old
serviceman,
johnny
cleveland
simpson
who
was
killed
in
vietnam
on
september
1968.
the
deceased
was
not
married
but
prior
to
his
death,
had
orally
acknowledged
the
child
as
his
own.
he
had
also
signed
a
statement
agreeing
to
pay
the
lying-in
expenses
and
he
had,
prior
to
his
death,
contributed
to
the
care
and
support
of
the
child.
in
addition,
the
paternity
of
the
child
had
been
recognized
by
the
social
security
and
veterans
administrations
for
the
purpose
of
paying
social
security
and
for
pension
benefits.
at
the
time
of
entering
the
service,
the
serviceman,
the
deceased,
did
not
designate
a
beneficiary
by
name
but
simply
checked
a
block
on
the
form
which
specified
that
payment
is
to
be
made
“in
the
order
of
precedence
set
forth
in
the
law.”
the
act
in
this
instance
provides
that
the
proceeds
shall
be
paid
in
this
order
of
precedence,
first,
to
the
designated
beneficiary,
secondly,
to
the
widow
or
widower,
third,
the
child
or
children,
fourth,
parents,
fifth,
the
executor-administrator,
sixth,
next
of
kin
under
the
laws
of
the
serviceman's
--
of
domicile.
following
the
death
of
the
deceased
in
action,
his
father,
offered
to
assist
in
securing
the
benefits
for
the
petitioner.
and
papers
were
turned
over
to
him
for
this
purpose
but
instead
of
securing
the
benefits
for
his
grandson,
the
grandfather
obtained
them
for
himself,
although
his
application
noted
that
there
was
an
illegitimate
son.
this
action
was
then
filed
on
the
part
and
on
behalf
of
the
minor.
following
depositions,
requests
for
admissions,
motions
for
summary
judgment
were
made.
the
superior
court
of
elbert
county
granted
summary
judgment
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner
and
denied
it
to
the
respondent.
that
court
relied
upon
lower
federal
court
decisions
interpreting
the
federal
employees'
group
life
insurance
act
which
it
held
that
illegitimate
children
could
take.
at
that
time
the
four
or
five
cases
interpreting
the
servicemen's
life
insurance
act
had
not
been
decided
or
had
not
been
reported.
the
court
of
appeals
of
georgia,
the
intermediate
appellate
court,
affirmed
using
the
same
approach
to
statutory
construction.
but
on
certiorari,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
relying
upon
three
prior
decisions,
two
involving
the
fegli
and
one,
decided
four
months
earlier,
involving
the
sgli,
held
that
the
words
“child
or
children”
should
be
construed
according
to
georgia
law
as
found
with
respect
to
wills,
contracts,
inheritance
and
deeds.
and
under
these
decisions,
child
or
children
would
include
legitimate
children
only.
two
justices
dissented.
i'd
like
to
address
some
remarks
preliminarily
to
the
motion
to
dismiss
in
this
case
on
the
ground
that
the
writ
was
improvidently
granted.
this
court
granted
certiorari
on
november
the
9th,
of
last
year.
in
early
december,
congress
passed
and
on
december
15th,
the
president
signed
an
amendment
to
the
servicemen's
group
life
insurance
act,
h.r.
907
public
law
92185
which
undertakes
to
define
the
terms
in
question
here
among
others.
with
respect
to
the
instant
problem,
child
is
defined
to
include
an
illegitimate
child
as
to
the
father
only
if
about
six
situations
are
met,
first,
that
the
father
must
have
acknowledged
to
the
child
in
a
writing
signed
by
him.
secondly,
the
father
must
have
been
judicially
ordered
to
contribute
to
the
child's
support
or
the
father
must
have
been
prior
to
death,
judicially
declared
to
be
the
father.
fourth,
proof
of
paternity
be
established
by
a
certified
copy
of
a
public
record
of
birth
or
baptism
showing
that
the
father
was
the
informant
and
that
he
listed
himself
as
father.
lastly,
proof
--
proof
of
paternity
can
be
established
from
the
service
department
of
a
public
record
showing
that
the
father
with
his
own
knowledge
was
named
as
father
of
the
child.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no,
sir.
i
do
not
think
so.
he
did
--
the
father
did
not
acknowledge
him
as
such
in
writing.
in
the
record,
there
is
an
--
a
statement
that
he
signed
at
the
doctor's
office
stating
that
he
would
be
responsible
for
the
lying-in
expenses,
but
he
did
not
acknowledge
the
child
as
his,
only
by
and
only
inferentially
as
it
may
arise
from
that
statement.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
they
have
declared
it.
this
does
not,
of
course,
affect
this
case
because
the
language
of
the
statute
expressly
so
declares
the
amendment.
secondly,
this
does
not
eliminate
the
constitutional
question
that's
involved
in
this
case
as
to
equal
protection,
if
that
would
still
be
applicable
because
you
still
have
imposed
a
burden
upon
an
illegitimate
child
that
is
not
imposed
upon
a
legitimate
child
and
none
of
the
rationale
of
oyama
versus
california
conceding
that
the
parents
can
be
penalized
for
illegitimate
--
or
illicit
relationships.
can
congress
itself
impose
the
burden,
the
onerous
procedural
burden
upon
the
child
where
he
is
not
responsible
for
this
situation?
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
my
contention
is,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
the
new
statute
does
not
cover
the
facts
of
this
case
except
it
would
exclude
the
child
in
this
instance.
but
we
also
expect
to
show,
i
think
it
is
apparent,
that
the
act
of
congress
really
would
not
cover
the
great
majority
of
situations
arising
and
likely
to
arise
under
the
servicemen's
group
life
insurance
act
because
of
the
fact
that
it's
so
seldom
that
there
is
a
formal
acknowledgement
or
that
there
has
been
a
judicial
determination.
now,
admittedly,
the
statute
purports
to
say
unless
it
has,
illegitimates
are
excluded.
it
--
it
applies
to
it
in
that
sense
but
we
say
that
still
does
not
avoid
the
constitutional
question.
that
resolves
the
statutory
interpretation
question
but
it
does
not
resolve
the
constitutional
question.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
there
is
a
direct
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that
is
correct.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
it
--
it
requires
definitive
proof
of
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no,
sir.
we
could
not
need
it
here.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
because
of
the
fact
that
this
necessitated
something
on
the
--
some
action
on
the
part
of
the
father
which
the
father
in
case
had
not
done.
he
didn't
--
had
not
taken
any
action
that
would
have
brought
him
under
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
--
anyone.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no,
sir.
it
is
not
like
the
veterans
benefit
act
in
38
u.s.c.
101
which
simply
says,
“or
other
proofs
satisfactory.”
it
is
of
a
particular
and
specific
type
of
proceeding
that
the
father
must
have
done
prior
to
his
death.
he
must
have
formally
acknowledged
him
in
writing.
that
was
not
done
here.
he
must
have
--
there
must
have
been
a
judicial
determination
or
he
must
have
quite
filled
out
a
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
the
mother's
--
the
federal
statute
does
not
reach
the
situation
of
the
mother.
it
deals
only
with
the
acts
necessary
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
--
to
be
done
by
the
father.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that
would
not
suffice
at
all
under
the
new
federal
statute,
the
1971
act.
it
will
necessitate
some
specific
action
by
the
father
in
order
to
be
brought
within
the
coverage
of
the
1971
amendment.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that's
correct.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that
is
correct.
so
unless
he
has
done
something
before
his
death,
to
bring
him
within
one
of
the
six
--
the
five
or
six
categories
of
the
federal
statute
which
had
not
been
done
in
this
case.
in
other
words,
if
this
federal
statute
had
been
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
death
of
the
deceased,
we
could
not
come
within
it
because
the
deceased
had
not
done
any
of
the
things
to
bring
him
under.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
well,
they
have
not
said
so
expressly
but
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
--
the
necessary
effect
--
the
necessary
effect.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that's
right.
that's
right,
sir.
in
that
respect
they
have.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that
is
certainly
true,
but
by
the
same
token
where
there
has
been
an
acknowledgement
in
orally
or
where
there
has
been
as
in
this
case,
a
written
statement
agreeing
to
be
responsible
for
lying-in
expenses.
we
submit
that
that
satisfies
all
the
reasonable
requirements
of
proof
and
to
require
these
other
burdensome
and
onerous
requirement
that
the
statute,
the
federal
statute
sets
forth,
is
--
is
to
impose
upon
an
illegitimate
an
onerous
burden
that
is
not
imposed
with
respect
to
a
legitimate
and
that
comes
within
the
rationale
of
the
oyama
case.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no,
sir.
the
federal
law
does
not
control
this
case
because
--
or
rather
the
federal
--
the
1971
statute
does
not
control.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
alright,
sir.
our
position
then
is
that
it
becomes
a
question
as
to
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
you
construe
in
the
light
of
the
context
in
which
the
statutory
term
appears.
the
word
gathers
meaning
from
the
context
in
which
it
is
used
and
since
we
expect
to
show
that
the
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
--
purpose
of
congress
here.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no.
i'm
not
sure
that,
mr.
justice
white,
whether
you're
referring
to
the
1971
amendment
or
the
original
1965
act.
now,
under
the
1971
amendment,
if
this
identically
same
factual
situation
that
we
have
here
was
to
arise
today,
the
1971
amendment
would
cover
it
and
would
preclude
the
child
from
recovering
unless
the
1971
amendment
is
declared
to
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
well,
the
1971
amendment
is
relevant
to
my
case
only
to
the
extent
that
the
contention
is
made
that
certiorari
should
be
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted
because
of
the
fact
that
since
congress
has
now
solved
the
problem
as
to
the
future,
the
problem
has
become
one
of
an
isolated
character,
not
meeting
the
requirements
of
the
court
for
certiorari
adjudication.
that
is
the
only
in
which
the
1971
amendment
is
relevant
here.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
correct.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
correct.
correct,
sir.
we
submit
that
the
case
relied
upon
for
dismissal,
the
rice
versus
the
sioux
city
cemetery
is
not
applicable.
in
that
case,
after
argument
and
affirmance
by
an
equally
divided
court,
the
--
our
legislature
passed
a
statute
which
prohibited
the
very
act
of
discrimination
complained
of.
the
court
reasoned
that
this
statute
had
rendered
the
pending
case
on
such
isolated
significance
that
the
question
was
not
likely
rise
again
--
to
arise
again
and
then
hence,
it
would
not
warrant
adjudication.
we
submit
instead
that
this
court's
more
recent
decisions
in
jones
versus
alfred
h.
4mayer
company,
392
u.s.
in
sullivan
versus
little
hunting
park,
in
396
u.s.
support
the
retention
of
jurisdiction
here,
in
both
of
these
cases.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
several
act
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that
one,
i
have
not
read,
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
alright,
sir.
in
both
of
these
cases,
civil
actions
had
been
instituted
under
section
1982
complaining
of
racial
discrimination
in
the
leasing
and
in
the
sale
of
real
estate.
these
suits
were
based
upon
transactions
that
accord
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
1968
fair
housing
act.
in
the
mayer
case,
certiorari
was
granted
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
act
in
the
case
it
was
decided
after
passage.
but
in
the
sullivan
case,
certiorari
was
granted
and
the
decision
was
rendered
after
the
passage.
in
both
cases,
this
court
rejected
the
contention
that
certiorari
should
be
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted.
in
the
sullivan
case,
this
was
set.
but
petitioners'
suits
were
commenced
on
march
16th,
1966,
two
years
before
that
act
was
passed.
it
would
be
irresponsible
judicial
administration
to
dismiss
a
suit
because
of
an
intervening
act
which
has
no
possible
application
to
events
long
preceding
its
enactment.
another
case
is
u.s.
versus
yazell
in
382
u.s.
341
which
involved
a
texas
statute
which
said
that
a
wife
could
not
bind
her
separate
property
by
contract,
a
married
woman.
the
texas
statute
was
subsequently
repealed
but
not
until
after
they
had
done
a
small
business
administration
loan
made
in
which
the
wife
cosigned
with
her
husband.
this
court
made
it
certiorari
and
despite
the
fact
that
the
state
statute
in
question
had
been
repealed
for
quite
a
number
of
years,
no
question
was
even
raised
as
to
the
propriety
of
certiorari.
the
1971
act
covers
only
situations
where
there
has
been
either,
generally
speaking,
a
formal
acknowledgement
in
writing
or
judicial
determination
of
some
similar
type
of
proof.
in
here,
none
of
those
requirements
would
be
met
so
very
clearly,
the
constitutional
question
that
looms
underneath
this
case
is
still
present
even
with
respect
to
the
1971
amendment
to
the
act.
there're
approximately
3.4
million
members
of
the
armed
services
covered
by
this
act
according
to
the
v.a.
it's
been
pointed
out
by
the
commandant
of
the
marine
corps
in
the
warner
case
from
virginia,
that
the
great
majority
of
the
servicemen
do
not
designate
a
beneficiary
by
name.
i
think
it's
also
reasonable
to
assume
that
the
majority
of
cases
probably
have
already
arisen.
as
we
diminish
our
participation
in
vietnam,
the
number
of
cases
of
course
would
certainly
slacken
off.
there
have
been
10
or
12
cases
reported
under
this
act
in
the
last
10
--
two
or
three
years.
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
filed
in
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
by
the
respondent
in
this
case,
reference
was
made
to
the
fact
that
there
were
numerous
cases
coming
up
under
this
section
which
--
which
this
question
was
involved.
this
brings
me
to
the
merits
of
the
case
with
respect
to
the
question
of
the
merits.
i
think
the
case
can
be
most
easily
disposed
of,
is
one
of
statutory
construction.
the
statute
here
says
child
or
children,
it
doesn't
say
legitimate
children.
and
there's
no
occasion
for
interpolating
into
it
as
one
federal
court
has
pointed
out
something
that
is
not
there.
the
statutory
terms
should
be
construed,
we
submit,
in
accordance
with
the
context
in
which
they
appear.
when
this
is
done,
the
inclusion
of
illegitimates
is
compelled.
this
is
so,
we
say
because
the
statute
was
designed
as
a
substitute
source
of
income
for
dependents.
and
this
purpose
is
served
just
as
much
with
respect
to
illegitimates
as
it
is
with
regard
to
legitimates.
contrary
to
what
we
said
in
our
brief,
i
think
the
legislative
history
of
the
1965
act
does
bear
this
out.
certainly,
the
committee
reports
too,
are
silent
on
the
subject.
but
the
statements
on
the
floor
do
have
for
--
the
floors
of
the
two
houses
of
congress
do
support
this.
there
are
repeated
references
to
the
fact
that
this
dependents,
to
survivors,
a
senate
version
which
would
have
limited
the
benefits
to
illegitimate
children
only
if
designated
as
a
beneficiary,
was
expressly
rejected
in
favor
of
the
house
version
which
contains
no
such
limitation.
the
cases
also
have
recognized
that
this
is
the
purpose
of
the
sgli
as
well
as
the
fegli.
and
in
a
committee
report
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
noon
recess,
i
was
making
reference
to
a
house
committee
report
which
accompanied
a
1970
amendment
to
the
servicemen's
group
life
insurance
act
which
raised
the
coverage
from
$10,000
to
$15,000.
and
this
report
made
--
express
reference
was
made
to
the
fact
that
the
insurance
was
designed
to
provide
support
for
dependents.
respondent
relies
upon
certain
statements
made
in
the
house
and
the
senate
committee
reports
accompanying
the
1971
amendment
which
we
have
previously
discussed
to
this
effect.
the
existing
law
does
not
define
the
terms
widow,
widower,
child
or
parent
for
sgli
purposes.
that's
presumably
leaving
such
definitions
to
local
state
law.
this
is
relied
upon
in
a
showing
solve
a
retroactive
legislative
intent.
now,
this
statement,
we
submit,
has
no
particular
advocacy
in
this
case
because
it
was
not
a
statement
made
contemporaneously
with
passage
of
the
1965
act
but
rather
made
six
years
later
in
connection
with
an
amendment
which
was
aimed
at
solving
the
very
problem
at
which
this
statement
was
directed.
the
united
mine
workers
case
in
330
u.s.,
the
united
versus
wise
in
370
u.s.,
this
court
held
that
statements
made
not
contemporaneously
with
passage
of
legislation
but
rather
in
subsequent
years
by
legislators
who
were
endeavoring
to
amend
that
legislature
have
little
or
no
weight
or
value
as
far
as
interpreting
the
statute.
moreover,
the
statements
here
made
were
not
independent
determinations
or
statements
made
by
congress
but
rather
this
was
simply
parroting
the
language
of
the
letter
from
the
administrator
of
veterans
affairs,
who
sponsored
this
legislation.
and
in
his
letter
of
transmittal,
he
used
the
same
language
which
was
quoted
verbatim
in
the
two
committee
reports
as
well
as
in
the
--
the
statement
referred
to
on
the
floor
of
the
house
of
representatives.
lastly,
this
statement
which
says
presumably
the
question
would
be
referred
to
state
law
not
only
is
contrary
to
the
majority
of
cases.
there
are
three
lower
federal
court
cases,
two
of
them
decided
since
my
brief
was
filed
or
at
least
they
were
not
in
the
--
they
were
not
annotated
at
the
time
our
brief
was
filed,
the
--
all
contrary
to
the
statement
made
by
the
administrator.
and
moreover,
on
its
face
the
statement
reflects
uncertainty.
and
in
then
the
desylva
v.
ballentine
case,
this
court
held
that
statements
are
made
by
an
administrative
agency
which
are
adopted
more
from
a
doubt
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
statute
rather
than
from
a
comfort
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
this
would
be
given
little
effect
because
of
the
fact
that
the
administrative
agency
itself
is
an
obvious
doubt
as
to
the
question.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i'm
coming
to
that
now.
the
desylva
we
say
is
distinguishable
because
of
the
fact
that
that
dealt
with
a
subject
matter
that
is
entirely
different
than
the
subject
matter
here.
and
the
desylva
case
of
course
dealt
with
the
copyright
act.
and
the
question
there
had
to
do
only
with
the
--
the
creation
of
a
right,
not
the
devolution
of
the
right
it
dealt.
here,
the
subject
matter
is
serviceman
and
that
is
a
category
which
this
court
has
held
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that
is
correct,
sir.
and
the
court
resolved
by
referring
to
state
law,
but
on
the
basis
of
a
determination
that
this
was
really
a
question
of
inheritance
that
congress
really
intended
in
the
copyright
act
to
establish
rights
of
inheritance.
and
consequently
if
you
would
refer
to
state
law
and
of
course
on
the
california
law,
the
illegititmate
could
take.
but
here,
the
question
relates
to
a
relationship
that
is
peculiarly
federal.
and
that
is
the
relationship
between
a
serviceman
and
the
government.
in
every
case
in
which
this
court
has
ever
decided
a
question
dealing
with
a
serviceman,
it
has
resolved
it
solely
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
we
have
referred
to
those
cases
in
our
brief.
there
are
three
of
them
that
involved
the
nsli
act
of
1940
which
the
national
servicemen's
life
insurance
act
of
1940.
two
of
those
cases
or
what
would
in
the
wissner
case
dealt
with
the
designation
of
beneficiaries.
in
every
one
of
those
cases,
this
court
resolved
the
question
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
without
referring
or
even
mentioning
state
law.
now,
a
person
does
not
become
a
federal
instrumentality
or
agent
by
writing
a
book
or
poem
or
music.
but
he
does
become
an
instrumentality
of
the
federal
government
when
he
joins
the
armed
services
or
is
drafted.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no,
sir,
because
there
was
no
formal
acknowledgement.
this
1971
amendment
constitutes
an
act
of
congress
that
specifies
who
is
--
who
is
a
child,
who
is
considered
a
child
and
absent
a
successful
attack
upon
the
constitutionality
of
the
1971
amendment.
the
petitioner
here
would
be
excluded
because
of
the
fact
that
his
father
did
not
formally
acknowledge
him
or
there
had
been
--
there
had
been
no
judicial
determination.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
well,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
don't
think
you
could
say
that
because
congress
decided
in
1971
that
illegitimate
children
will
be
included
only
in
four
or
five
different
specific
categories
that
it
must
have
meant
the
same
thing
in
1965
when
it
just
used
the
words
“child
or
children.”
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes.
we
--
we
can
see
that
because
the
1971
amendment
expressly
says
that
it
shall
not
apply.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
and
the
last
section
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that's
right,
sir.
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
in
one
category.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
one
category
where
it
deals
with
next
of
kin
according
the
laws
of
the
domicile
of
the
serviceman's
or
rather
according
to
the
laws
of
the
serviceman's
domicile.
and
i
suppose
you
might
say
that
you
have
to
go
to
state
law
to
determine
who
is
the
executor
or
administrator.
but
in
california's
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
--
expressio
unius
argument
that
what
congress
intended
to
refer
to
state
law
in
the
sgli.
it
expressly
so
said
in
this
instance.
it
did
not
in
1965.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
in
that
sense,
yes.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
but
by
expressed
reference
to
state
law.
with
respect
to
the
constitutional
question
on
the
matter
of
a
classification
generally,
we
say
that
the
labine
case
is
distinguishable
because
of
the
subject
matter.
a
classification
might
well
be
constitutional
in
the
context
of
intestate
cessation
and
not
constitutional
when
applied
to
a
federal
statute
having
well
fair
type
connotations.
but
i
think
the
easiest
resolution
is
as
far
as
the
constitutional
issue
is
concerned,
is
the
additional
challenge
to
classification
on
the
ground
that
this
classification
is
really
a
racial
classification
because
of
the
peculiarities
of
the
history
of
slavery
in
this
country.
in
the
griggs
case,
this
court
held
that
informant
procedures
and
practices
and
tests
that
were
neutral
on
their
face
but
were
found
to
be
discriminatory
in
operation
would
--
were
prohibited
by
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
where
this
heavier
burden
placed
upon
the
ethnic
minority,
was
found
to
be
a
consequence
of
past
discrimination
in
education.
now
we
submit
that
the
same
principle
applied
to
the
equal
protection
clause
in
the
constitution
invalidates
the
discrimination
here,
at
least
in
a
state
having
a
history
of
negro
slavery
and
racial
discrimination.
that
the
classification
falls
more
heavily
on
blacks
can
hardly
be
subject
to
dispute.
the
statistics
in
this
record
indicate
that
in
1957,
the
ratio
of
illegitimates
between
blacks
and
whites
for
the
country
as
a
whole
was
about
2-to-1.
but
in
georgia
it
was
8-to-1,
in
mississippi,
26-to-1.
in
louisiana
and
alabama,
about
7
1/2-to-8-to
1.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
well,
they
would
be
certainly
be
weakened
somewhat.
but
the
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
to
some
extent.
but
when
it
is
so
great
as
to
suggest
a
very
particular
reason
for
it,
we
submit
that
that
of
course
then
changes
this
--
the
character
of
the
difference.
in
1880,
two-thirds
of
all
negros
born
in
united
states
were
illegitimate
and
in
some
communities
today,
nearly
half
or
more
of
all
negros
are
illegitimate.
in
1963,
24%
of
all
non-white
births
in
united
states
were
illegitimate.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
to
the
father
of
the
deceased
sense.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
he
was
black.
we
have
attempted
to
show
in
our
brief
how
the
institution
of
slavery
was
partially
responsible,
and
large
part
responsible
for
this
greater
incidents
of
illegitimacy.
and
we
submit
that
where
we
--
we
have
here
is
in
this
case.
number
one,
the
undisputed
fact
that
the
incidents
is
greater.
number
two,
that
it
is
the
effect,
the
continuing
effect
of
this
past
discrimination
that
the
classification
must
fall.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
(inaudible)
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
granted
certiorari
in
this
case
to
review
a
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
holding
that
the
beneficiary
clause
of
the
servicemen's
life
insurance
act
of
1965
should
be
construed
according
to
georgia
law.
and
on
that
basis,
the
words
“child
or
children”
is
used
in
the
federal
act,
were
held
to
include
legitimate
children
only
and
to
exclude
the
illegitimate
children
of
a
deceased
serviceman.
this
case
commenced
with
the
filing
of
a
suit
in
the
superior
court
of
elbert
county,
georgia
in
july,
1969
against
the
prudential
insurance
company
of
america,
the
respondent,
seeking
recovery
of
the
$10,000
proceeds
of
a
policy
written
under
the
act.
at
the
time
of
filing
suit,
the
petitioner,
lorenzo
willis,
was
a
two-year-old,
illegitimate,
negro
son
of
a
15-year-old
mother,
janice
willis
and
a
20-year-old
serviceman,
johnny
cleveland
simpson
who
was
killed
in
vietnam
on
september
1968.
the
deceased
was
not
married
but
prior
to
his
death,
had
orally
acknowledged
the
child
as
his
own.
he
had
also
signed
a
statement
agreeing
to
pay
the
lying-in
expenses
and
he
had,
prior
to
his
death,
contributed
to
the
care
and
support
of
the
child.
in
addition,
the
paternity
of
the
child
had
been
recognized
by
the
social
security
and
veterans
administrations
for
the
purpose
of
paying
social
security
and
for
pension
benefits.
at
the
time
of
entering
the
service,
the
serviceman,
the
deceased,
did
not
designate
a
beneficiary
by
name
but
simply
checked
a
block
on
the
form
which
specified
that
payment
is
to
be
made
“in
the
order
of
precedence
set
forth
in
the
law.”
the
act
in
this
instance
provides
that
the
proceeds
shall
be
paid
in
this
order
of
precedence,
first,
to
the
designated
beneficiary,
secondly,
to
the
widow
or
widower,
third,
the
child
or
children,
fourth,
parents,
fifth,
the
executor-administrator,
sixth,
next
of
kin
under
the
laws
of
the
serviceman's
--
of
domicile.
following
the
death
of
the
deceased
in
action,
his
father,
offered
to
assist
in
securing
the
benefits
for
the
petitioner.
and
papers
were
turned
over
to
him
for
this
purpose
but
instead
of
securing
the
benefits
for
his
grandson,
the
grandfather
obtained
them
for
himself,
although
his
application
noted
that
there
was
an
illegitimate
son.
this
action
was
then
filed
on
the
part
and
on
behalf
of
the
minor.
following
depositions,
requests
for
admissions,
motions
for
summary
judgment
were
made.
the
superior
court
of
elbert
county
granted
summary
judgment
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner
and
denied
it
to
the
respondent.
that
court
relied
upon
lower
federal
court
decisions
interpreting
the
federal
employees'
group
life
insurance
act
which
it
held
that
illegitimate
children
could
take.
at
that
time
the
four
or
five
cases
interpreting
the
servicemen's
life
insurance
act
had
not
been
decided
or
had
not
been
reported.
the
court
of
appeals
of
georgia,
the
intermediate
appellate
court,
affirmed
using
the
same
approach
to
statutory
construction.
but
on
certiorari,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
relying
upon
three
prior
decisions,
two
involving
the
fegli
and
one,
decided
four
months
earlier,
involving
the
sgli,
held
that
the
words
“child
or
children”
should
be
construed
according
to
georgia
law
as
found
with
respect
to
wills,
contracts,
inheritance
and
deeds.
and
under
these
decisions,
child
or
children
would
include
legitimate
children
only.
two
justices
dissented.
i'd
like
to
address
some
remarks
preliminarily
to
the
motion
to
dismiss
in
this
case
on
the
ground
that
the
writ
was
improvidently
granted.
this
court
granted
certiorari
on
november
the
9th,
of
last
year.
in
early
december,
congress
passed
and
on
december
15th,
the
president
signed
an
amendment
to
the
servicemen's
group
life
insurance
act,
h.r.
907
public
law
92185
which
undertakes
to
define
the
terms
in
question
here
among
others.
with
respect
to
the
instant
problem,
child
is
defined
to
include
an
illegitimate
child
as
to
the
father
only
if
about
six
situations
are
met,
first,
that
the
father
must
have
acknowledged
to
the
child
in
a
writing
signed
by
him.
secondly,
the
father
must
have
been
judicially
ordered
to
contribute
to
the
child's
support
or
the
father
must
have
been
prior
to
death,
judicially
declared
to
be
the
father.
fourth,
proof
of
paternity
be
established
by
a
certified
copy
of
a
public
record
of
birth
or
baptism
showing
that
the
father
was
the
informant
and
that
he
listed
himself
as
father.
lastly,
proof
--
proof
of
paternity
can
be
established
from
the
service
department
of
a
public
record
showing
that
the
father
with
his
own
knowledge
was
named
as
father
of
the
child.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no,
sir.
i
do
not
think
so.
he
did
--
the
father
did
not
acknowledge
him
as
such
in
writing.
in
the
record,
there
is
an
--
a
statement
that
he
signed
at
the
doctor's
office
stating
that
he
would
be
responsible
for
the
lying-in
expenses,
but
he
did
not
acknowledge
the
child
as
his,
only
by
and
only
inferentially
as
it
may
arise
from
that
statement.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
they
have
declared
it.
this
does
not,
of
course,
affect
this
case
because
the
language
of
the
statute
expressly
so
declares
the
amendment.
secondly,
this
does
not
eliminate
the
constitutional
question
that's
involved
in
this
case
as
to
equal
protection,
if
that
would
still
be
applicable
because
you
still
have
imposed
a
burden
upon
an
illegitimate
child
that
is
not
imposed
upon
a
legitimate
child
and
none
of
the
rationale
of
oyama
versus
california
conceding
that
the
parents
can
be
penalized
for
illegitimate
--
or
illicit
relationships.
can
congress
itself
impose
the
burden,
the
onerous
procedural
burden
upon
the
child
where
he
is
not
responsible
for
this
situation?
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
my
contention
is,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
the
new
statute
does
not
cover
the
facts
of
this
case
except
it
would
exclude
the
child
in
this
instance.
but
we
also
expect
to
show,
i
think
it
is
apparent,
that
the
act
of
congress
really
would
not
cover
the
great
majority
of
situations
arising
and
likely
to
arise
under
the
servicemen's
group
life
insurance
act
because
of
the
fact
that
it's
so
seldom
that
there
is
a
formal
acknowledgement
or
that
there
has
been
a
judicial
determination.
now,
admittedly,
the
statute
purports
to
say
unless
it
has,
illegitimates
are
excluded.
it
--
it
applies
to
it
in
that
sense
but
we
say
that
still
does
not
avoid
the
constitutional
question.
that
resolves
the
statutory
interpretation
question
but
it
does
not
resolve
the
constitutional
question.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
there
is
a
direct
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that
is
correct.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
it
--
it
requires
definitive
proof
of
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no,
sir.
we
could
not
need
it
here.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
because
of
the
fact
that
this
necessitated
something
on
the
--
some
action
on
the
part
of
the
father
which
the
father
in
case
had
not
done.
he
didn't
--
had
not
taken
any
action
that
would
have
brought
him
under
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
--
anyone.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no,
sir.
it
is
not
like
the
veterans
benefit
act
in
38
u.s.c.
101
which
simply
says,
“or
other
proofs
satisfactory.”
it
is
of
a
particular
and
specific
type
of
proceeding
that
the
father
must
have
done
prior
to
his
death.
he
must
have
formally
acknowledged
him
in
writing.
that
was
not
done
here.
he
must
have
--
there
must
have
been
a
judicial
determination
or
he
must
have
quite
filled
out
a
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
the
mother's
--
the
federal
statute
does
not
reach
the
situation
of
the
mother.
it
deals
only
with
the
acts
necessary
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
--
to
be
done
by
the
father.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that
would
not
suffice
at
all
under
the
new
federal
statute,
the
1971
act.
it
will
necessitate
some
specific
action
by
the
father
in
order
to
be
brought
within
the
coverage
of
the
1971
amendment.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that's
correct.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that
is
correct.
so
unless
he
has
done
something
before
his
death,
to
bring
him
within
one
of
the
six
--
the
five
or
six
categories
of
the
federal
statute
which
had
not
been
done
in
this
case.
in
other
words,
if
this
federal
statute
had
been
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
death
of
the
deceased,
we
could
not
come
within
it
because
the
deceased
had
not
done
any
of
the
things
to
bring
him
under.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
well,
they
have
not
said
so
expressly
but
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
--
the
necessary
effect
--
the
necessary
effect.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that's
right.
that's
right,
sir.
in
that
respect
they
have.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that
is
certainly
true,
but
by
the
same
token
where
there
has
been
an
acknowledgement
in
orally
or
where
there
has
been
as
in
this
case,
a
written
statement
agreeing
to
be
responsible
for
lying-in
expenses.
we
submit
that
that
satisfies
all
the
reasonable
requirements
of
proof
and
to
require
these
other
burdensome
and
onerous
requirement
that
the
statute,
the
federal
statute
sets
forth,
is
--
is
to
impose
upon
an
illegitimate
an
onerous
burden
that
is
not
imposed
with
respect
to
a
legitimate
and
that
comes
within
the
rationale
of
the
oyama
case.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no,
sir.
the
federal
law
does
not
control
this
case
because
--
or
rather
the
federal
--
the
1971
statute
does
not
control.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
alright,
sir.
our
position
then
is
that
it
becomes
a
question
as
to
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
you
construe
in
the
light
of
the
context
in
which
the
statutory
term
appears.
the
word
gathers
meaning
from
the
context
in
which
it
is
used
and
since
we
expect
to
show
that
the
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
--
purpose
of
congress
here.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no.
i'm
not
sure
that,
mr.
justice
white,
whether
you're
referring
to
the
1971
amendment
or
the
original
1965
act.
now,
under
the
1971
amendment,
if
this
identically
same
factual
situation
that
we
have
here
was
to
arise
today,
the
1971
amendment
would
cover
it
and
would
preclude
the
child
from
recovering
unless
the
1971
amendment
is
declared
to
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
well,
the
1971
amendment
is
relevant
to
my
case
only
to
the
extent
that
the
contention
is
made
that
certiorari
should
be
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted
because
of
the
fact
that
since
congress
has
now
solved
the
problem
as
to
the
future,
the
problem
has
become
one
of
an
isolated
character,
not
meeting
the
requirements
of
the
court
for
certiorari
adjudication.
that
is
the
only
in
which
the
1971
amendment
is
relevant
here.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
correct.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
correct.
correct,
sir.
we
submit
that
the
case
relied
upon
for
dismissal,
the
rice
versus
the
sioux
city
cemetery
is
not
applicable.
in
that
case,
after
argument
and
affirmance
by
an
equally
divided
court,
the
--
our
legislature
passed
a
statute
which
prohibited
the
very
act
of
discrimination
complained
of.
the
court
reasoned
that
this
statute
had
rendered
the
pending
case
on
such
isolated
significance
that
the
question
was
not
likely
rise
again
--
to
arise
again
and
then
hence,
it
would
not
warrant
adjudication.
we
submit
instead
that
this
court's
more
recent
decisions
in
jones
versus
alfred
h.
4mayer
company,
392
u.s.
in
sullivan
versus
little
hunting
park,
in
396
u.s.
support
the
retention
of
jurisdiction
here,
in
both
of
these
cases.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
several
act
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that
one,
i
have
not
read,
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
alright,
sir.
in
both
of
these
cases,
civil
actions
had
been
instituted
under
section
1982
complaining
of
racial
discrimination
in
the
leasing
and
in
the
sale
of
real
estate.
these
suits
were
based
upon
transactions
that
accord
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
1968
fair
housing
act.
in
the
mayer
case,
certiorari
was
granted
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
act
in
the
case
it
was
decided
after
passage.
but
in
the
sullivan
case,
certiorari
was
granted
and
the
decision
was
rendered
after
the
passage.
in
both
cases,
this
court
rejected
the
contention
that
certiorari
should
be
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted.
in
the
sullivan
case,
this
was
set.
but
petitioners'
suits
were
commenced
on
march
16th,
1966,
two
years
before
that
act
was
passed.
it
would
be
irresponsible
judicial
administration
to
dismiss
a
suit
because
of
an
intervening
act
which
has
no
possible
application
to
events
long
preceding
its
enactment.
another
case
is
u.s.
versus
yazell
in
382
u.s.
341
which
involved
a
texas
statute
which
said
that
a
wife
could
not
bind
her
separate
property
by
contract,
a
married
woman.
the
texas
statute
was
subsequently
repealed
but
not
until
after
they
had
done
a
small
business
administration
loan
made
in
which
the
wife
cosigned
with
her
husband.
this
court
made
it
certiorari
and
despite
the
fact
that
the
state
statute
in
question
had
been
repealed
for
quite
a
number
of
years,
no
question
was
even
raised
as
to
the
propriety
of
certiorari.
the
1971
act
covers
only
situations
where
there
has
been
either,
generally
speaking,
a
formal
acknowledgement
in
writing
or
judicial
determination
of
some
similar
type
of
proof.
in
here,
none
of
those
requirements
would
be
met
so
very
clearly,
the
constitutional
question
that
looms
underneath
this
case
is
still
present
even
with
respect
to
the
1971
amendment
to
the
act.
there're
approximately
3.4
million
members
of
the
armed
services
covered
by
this
act
according
to
the
v.a.
it's
been
pointed
out
by
the
commandant
of
the
marine
corps
in
the
warner
case
from
virginia,
that
the
great
majority
of
the
servicemen
do
not
designate
a
beneficiary
by
name.
i
think
it's
also
reasonable
to
assume
that
the
majority
of
cases
probably
have
already
arisen.
as
we
diminish
our
participation
in
vietnam,
the
number
of
cases
of
course
would
certainly
slacken
off.
there
have
been
10
or
12
cases
reported
under
this
act
in
the
last
10
--
two
or
three
years.
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
filed
in
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
by
the
respondent
in
this
case,
reference
was
made
to
the
fact
that
there
were
numerous
cases
coming
up
under
this
section
which
--
which
this
question
was
involved.
this
brings
me
to
the
merits
of
the
case
with
respect
to
the
question
of
the
merits.
i
think
the
case
can
be
most
easily
disposed
of,
is
one
of
statutory
construction.
the
statute
here
says
child
or
children,
it
doesn't
say
legitimate
children.
and
there's
no
occasion
for
interpolating
into
it
as
one
federal
court
has
pointed
out
something
that
is
not
there.
the
statutory
terms
should
be
construed,
we
submit,
in
accordance
with
the
context
in
which
they
appear.
when
this
is
done,
the
inclusion
of
illegitimates
is
compelled.
this
is
so,
we
say
because
the
statute
was
designed
as
a
substitute
source
of
income
for
dependents.
and
this
purpose
is
served
just
as
much
with
respect
to
illegitimates
as
it
is
with
regard
to
legitimates.
contrary
to
what
we
said
in
our
brief,
i
think
the
legislative
history
of
the
1965
act
does
bear
this
out.
certainly,
the
committee
reports
too,
are
silent
on
the
subject.
but
the
statements
on
the
floor
do
have
for
--
the
floors
of
the
two
houses
of
congress
do
support
this.
there
are
repeated
references
to
the
fact
that
this
dependents,
to
survivors,
a
senate
version
which
would
have
limited
the
benefits
to
illegitimate
children
only
if
designated
as
a
beneficiary,
was
expressly
rejected
in
favor
of
the
house
version
which
contains
no
such
limitation.
the
cases
also
have
recognized
that
this
is
the
purpose
of
the
sgli
as
well
as
the
fegli.
and
in
a
committee
report
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
noon
recess,
i
was
making
reference
to
a
house
committee
report
which
accompanied
a
1970
amendment
to
the
servicemen's
group
life
insurance
act
which
raised
the
coverage
from
$10,000
to
$15,000.
and
this
report
made
--
express
reference
was
made
to
the
fact
that
the
insurance
was
designed
to
provide
support
for
dependents.
respondent
relies
upon
certain
statements
made
in
the
house
and
the
senate
committee
reports
accompanying
the
1971
amendment
which
we
have
previously
discussed
to
this
effect.
the
existing
law
does
not
define
the
terms
widow,
widower,
child
or
parent
for
sgli
purposes.
that's
presumably
leaving
such
definitions
to
local
state
law.
this
is
relied
upon
in
a
showing
solve
a
retroactive
legislative
intent.
now,
this
statement,
we
submit,
has
no
particular
advocacy
in
this
case
because
it
was
not
a
statement
made
contemporaneously
with
passage
of
the
1965
act
but
rather
made
six
years
later
in
connection
with
an
amendment
which
was
aimed
at
solving
the
very
problem
at
which
this
statement
was
directed.
the
united
mine
workers
case
in
330
u.s.,
the
united
versus
wise
in
370
u.s.,
this
court
held
that
statements
made
not
contemporaneously
with
passage
of
legislation
but
rather
in
subsequent
years
by
legislators
who
were
endeavoring
to
amend
that
legislature
have
little
or
no
weight
or
value
as
far
as
interpreting
the
statute.
moreover,
the
statements
here
made
were
not
independent
determinations
or
statements
made
by
congress
but
rather
this
was
simply
parroting
the
language
of
the
letter
from
the
administrator
of
veterans
affairs,
who
sponsored
this
legislation.
and
in
his
letter
of
transmittal,
he
used
the
same
language
which
was
quoted
verbatim
in
the
two
committee
reports
as
well
as
in
the
--
the
statement
referred
to
on
the
floor
of
the
house
of
representatives.
lastly,
this
statement
which
says
presumably
the
question
would
be
referred
to
state
law
not
only
is
contrary
to
the
majority
of
cases.
there
are
three
lower
federal
court
cases,
two
of
them
decided
since
my
brief
was
filed
or
at
least
they
were
not
in
the
--
they
were
not
annotated
at
the
time
our
brief
was
filed,
the
--
all
contrary
to
the
statement
made
by
the
administrator.
and
moreover,
on
its
face
the
statement
reflects
uncertainty.
and
in
then
the
desylva
v.
ballentine
case,
this
court
held
that
statements
are
made
by
an
administrative
agency
which
are
adopted
more
from
a
doubt
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
statute
rather
than
from
a
comfort
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
this
would
be
given
little
effect
because
of
the
fact
that
the
administrative
agency
itself
is
an
obvious
doubt
as
to
the
question.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i'm
coming
to
that
now.
the
desylva
we
say
is
distinguishable
because
of
the
fact
that
that
dealt
with
a
subject
matter
that
is
entirely
different
than
the
subject
matter
here.
and
the
desylva
case
of
course
dealt
with
the
copyright
act.
and
the
question
there
had
to
do
only
with
the
--
the
creation
of
a
right,
not
the
devolution
of
the
right
it
dealt.
here,
the
subject
matter
is
serviceman
and
that
is
a
category
which
this
court
has
held
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that
is
correct,
sir.
and
the
court
resolved
by
referring
to
state
law,
but
on
the
basis
of
a
determination
that
this
was
really
a
question
of
inheritance
that
congress
really
intended
in
the
copyright
act
to
establish
rights
of
inheritance.
and
consequently
if
you
would
refer
to
state
law
and
of
course
on
the
california
law,
the
illegititmate
could
take.
but
here,
the
question
relates
to
a
relationship
that
is
peculiarly
federal.
and
that
is
the
relationship
between
a
serviceman
and
the
government.
in
every
case
in
which
this
court
has
ever
decided
a
question
dealing
with
a
serviceman,
it
has
resolved
it
solely
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
we
have
referred
to
those
cases
in
our
brief.
there
are
three
of
them
that
involved
the
nsli
act
of
1940
which
the
national
servicemen's
life
insurance
act
of
1940.
two
of
those
cases
or
what
would
in
the
wissner
case
dealt
with
the
designation
of
beneficiaries.
in
every
one
of
those
cases,
this
court
resolved
the
question
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
without
referring
or
even
mentioning
state
law.
now,
a
person
does
not
become
a
federal
instrumentality
or
agent
by
writing
a
book
or
poem
or
music.
but
he
does
become
an
instrumentality
of
the
federal
government
when
he
joins
the
armed
services
or
is
drafted.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no,
sir,
because
there
was
no
formal
acknowledgement.
this
1971
amendment
constitutes
an
act
of
congress
that
specifies
who
is
--
who
is
a
child,
who
is
considered
a
child
and
absent
a
successful
attack
upon
the
constitutionality
of
the
1971
amendment.
the
petitioner
here
would
be
excluded
because
of
the
fact
that
his
father
did
not
formally
acknowledge
him
or
there
had
been
--
there
had
been
no
judicial
determination.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
well,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
don't
think
you
could
say
that
because
congress
decided
in
1971
that
illegitimate
children
will
be
included
only
in
four
or
five
different
specific
categories
that
it
must
have
meant
the
same
thing
in
1965
when
it
just
used
the
words
“child
or
children.”
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes.
we
--
we
can
see
that
because
the
1971
amendment
expressly
says
that
it
shall
not
apply.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
and
the
last
section
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that's
right,
sir.
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
in
one
category.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
one
category
where
it
deals
with
next
of
kin
according
the
laws
of
the
domicile
of
the
serviceman's
or
rather
according
to
the
laws
of
the
serviceman's
domicile.
and
i
suppose
you
might
say
that
you
have
to
go
to
state
law
to
determine
who
is
the
executor
or
administrator.
but
in
california's
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
--
expressio
unius
argument
that
what
congress
intended
to
refer
to
state
law
in
the
sgli.
it
expressly
so
said
in
this
instance.
it
did
not
in
1965.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
in
that
sense,
yes.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
but
by
expressed
reference
to
state
law.
with
respect
to
the
constitutional
question
on
the
matter
of
a
classification
generally,
we
say
that
the
labine
case
is
distinguishable
because
of
the
subject
matter.
a
classification
might
well
be
constitutional
in
the
context
of
intestate
cessation
and
not
constitutional
when
applied
to
a
federal
statute
having
well
fair
type
connotations.
but
i
think
the
easiest
resolution
is
as
far
as
the
constitutional
issue
is
concerned,
is
the
additional
challenge
to
classification
on
the
ground
that
this
classification
is
really
a
racial
classification
because
of
the
peculiarities
of
the
history
of
slavery
in
this
country.
in
the
griggs
case,
this
court
held
that
informant
procedures
and
practices
and
tests
that
were
neutral
on
their
face
but
were
found
to
be
discriminatory
in
operation
would
--
were
prohibited
by
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
where
this
heavier
burden
placed
upon
the
ethnic
minority,
was
found
to
be
a
consequence
of
past
discrimination
in
education.
now
we
submit
that
the
same
principle
applied
to
the
equal
protection
clause
in
the
constitution
invalidates
the
discrimination
here,
at
least
in
a
state
having
a
history
of
negro
slavery
and
racial
discrimination.
that
the
classification
falls
more
heavily
on
blacks
can
hardly
be
subject
to
dispute.
the
statistics
in
this
record
indicate
that
in
1957,
the
ratio
of
illegitimates
between
blacks
and
whites
for
the
country
as
a
whole
was
about
2-to-1.
but
in
georgia
it
was
8-to-1,
in
mississippi,
26-to-1.
in
louisiana
and
alabama,
about
7
1/2-to-8-to
1.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
well,
they
would
be
certainly
be
weakened
somewhat.
but
the
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
to
some
extent.
but
when
it
is
so
great
as
to
suggest
a
very
particular
reason
for
it,
we
submit
that
that
of
course
then
changes
this
--
the
character
of
the
difference.
in
1880,
two-thirds
of
all
negros
born
in
united
states
were
illegitimate
and
in
some
communities
today,
nearly
half
or
more
of
all
negros
are
illegitimate.
in
1963,
24%
of
all
non-white
births
in
united
states
were
illegitimate.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
to
the
father
of
the
deceased
sense.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
he
was
black.
we
have
attempted
to
show
in
our
brief
how
the
institution
of
slavery
was
partially
responsible,
and
large
part
responsible
for
this
greater
incidents
of
illegitimacy.
and
we
submit
that
where
we
--
we
have
here
is
in
this
case.
number
one,
the
undisputed
fact
that
the
incidents
is
greater.
number
two,
that
it
is
the
effect,
the
continuing
effect
of
this
past
discrimination
that
the
classification
must
fall.
