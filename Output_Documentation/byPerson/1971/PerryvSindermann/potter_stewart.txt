justice
potter
stewart
well
you
said
dismissal,
and
i
wondered
if
you
were
speaking
that
and
i
gather
you
are
not.
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
a
professor,
you
are
saying?
justice
potter
stewart
a
two-year
college.
justice
potter
stewart
how
big
is
a
institution
--
odessa
junior
college,
how
many
students?
justice
potter
stewart
about
2000
students
and
how
about
the
faculty?
justice
potter
stewart
how
large
is
the
department?
social
or
political
science?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
well,
mr.
gottesman,
if
sindermann
had
been
an
original
applicant
for
employment
by
odessa
junior
college,
if
he
had
come
with
impeccable
academic,
intellectual
credentials,
with
all
sorts
of
fine
letters
of
recommendation
from
the
dean
and
the
professors
at
harvard
where
he
had
received
his
graduate
degree
and
if
the
hiring
authorities
in
odessa
junior
college
had
said,
“
yes,
we
recognize.
you
are
superbly
qualified
to
be
a
member
of
our
faculty,
academically,
professionally,
intellectually,
your
character
also
we
grant
is
impeccable
but
that
you
have
been
making
too
many
speeches
on
subjects
we
don't
agree
with
you
on,
so
we
are
not
going
to
hire
you,
would
he
have
a
entire
cause
of
action.”
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
that's
quite
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
do
want
to
get
into
that
because
i
think
it's
just
your
position
in
this
case.
not
in
my
question.
i
am
not
talking
about
a
non-communist
oath
or
any
other
kind
of
oath.
justice
potter
stewart
but
his
contract
has
expired
as
it
does
each
year.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
each
year,
he
has
to
be
rehired
and
i
am
asking
simply
about
original
employment.
justice
potter
stewart
for
year
college
or
rather
two
year
college
--
justice
potter
stewart
therefore,
we
are
not
going
to
hire
you.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
a
dismissal
case.
so
what
i'm
asking
you
about
is
if
this
is
a
case
where
his
employment
contract
had
expired?
i
am
asking
about
the
case
of
original
employment.
justice
potter
stewart
all
on
behalf
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
pickering
is
like
--
justice
potter
stewart
a
dismissal
case
and
you
properly
identified
the
questions
on
which
we
granted
certiorari
in
this
case.
the
question
to
which
mr.
shafer
didn't
really
address
himself.
and
i
think
that's
a
question
on
which
we
did
grant
certiorari
in
this
case.
and
that's
the
reason
i
asked
my
question
about
original
employment.
justice
potter
stewart
the
non-renewed
teachers
that
he
was
fired
for
exercising
his
first
amendment
right?
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
the
university
said
that,
yeah,
we
fired
you
for
that
reason
and
we
are
sticking
to
it,
is
only
alternative
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
what
do
you
think
the
remedy
or
what
do
you
think
was
going
to
go
on
in
a
district
court
for
this
remand?
justice
potter
stewart
you
figure,
you
won
your
case
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
potter
stewart
for
a
trial
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
you
said
dismissal,
and
i
wondered
if
you
were
speaking
that
and
i
gather
you
are
not.
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
a
professor,
you
are
saying?
justice
potter
stewart
a
two-year

justice
potter
stewart
how
big
is

how

justice

about

how

justice

stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
well,
mr.
gottesman,
if
sindermann
had
been
an
original
applicant
for

by
odessa
junior

if
he
had

justice

i

justice

i
do
want
to
get

that
because
i

not
in
my

i
am
not

or
any

kind
of
oath.
justice
potter
stewart
but
his
contract
has
expired
as
it
does
each
year.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
each
year,
he
has
to
be
rehired
and
i
am
asking
simply
about
original
employment.
justice
potter
stewart
for
year
college
or
rather
two
year
college
--
justice
potter
stewart
therefore,
we
are
not
going
to
hire
you.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
a
dismissal
case.
so
what
i'm
asking
you
about
is
if
this
is
a
case
where
his
employment
contract
had
expired?
i
am
asking
about
the
case
of
original
employment.
justice
potter
stewart
all
on

of
--
justice
potter
stewart

pickering

justice

a

case
and
you

the
question
to
which
mr.
shafer
didn't
really
address
himself.
and
i
think
that's
a
question
on
which
we
did
grant
certiorari
in
this
case.
and
that's
the
reason
i
asked
my
question
about
original
employment.
justice

stewart
the
non-renewed
teachers
that
he
was
