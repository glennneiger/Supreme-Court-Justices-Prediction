mr.
w.
o.
shafer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
usually
i
carry
a
coke
box
to
take
care
of
that
difference.
petitioners
in
this
case
are
the
president
and
the
board
of
regents
of
odessa
college,
a
small
town
in
west
texas.
the
respondent,
sindermann
was
a
teacher
employed
on
a
year
to
year
contract,
which
had
it's
expiration
was
not
renewed.
termination
did
not
occur
during
the
contract
term.
before
the
term
date
actually
expired
and
before
official
notice
that
it
would
not
be
renewed,
he
claimed
he
was
fired
for
anti-administration
activity.
the
president
of
this
college
also
had
about
simultaneous
with
the
notification
of
non-renewal,
issued
a
press
release
in
which
he
detailed
the
activities,
and
as
we
read
in
this
claim
that
it
had
any
thing
to
do
with
his
discharge.
but
it
is
set
out
in
detail,
what
we
considered
to
be,
too
precise,
valid
and
legitimate
grounds
for
non-renewal
which
included
one;
persistent
insubordination
and
two;
a
disruption
of
harmony,
among
his
colleagues,
by
the
way
of
harassment.
now,
we
don't
know
of
any
decisions
that
says
that
either
of
those
situations,
or
invalid
as
grounds
for
dismissal,
three
days
and
with
a
notification--
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
it
is
a
non-renewal,
mr.
justice
and
i
debate
in
terms
of
termination
and
i
may
slip
and
say
discharge,
i
do
hope
to
make
it
clear
that
it
was
a
year-to-year
contract.
it
was
not
renewed
at
the
expiration
of
the
contract.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
yes,
it
is
a
failure
to
renew
or
give
him
another
contract.
these
are
year-to-year
contracts,
and
what
we
present
here
as
a
non-tenure
college
in
a
non-tenure
state
and
with
a
non-tenure
profession.
and
if
i
say
termination,
and
i
mean
to
say
non-renewal.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
no
sir,
we
do
not.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
yes,
well,
and
i
guess
you
would
say
pro-professor,
yes
sir,
this
is
a
junior
college
and--
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
yes,
sir
a
two
year
college.
so
we
don't
have
chairs
and
things
of
that
types
of
that
nature,
if
you
would
find
in
a
ford
university.
i
do
hope
to
make
that
clear
though
i
may
have
used
that
term,
i
don't
mean
to,
i
will
try
not
to.
three
days
after,
he
had
notice
of
the
non-renewal,
sindermann
filed
a
suit
in
the
federal
court
in
our
area
for
$475000
of
damages,
and
seeking
various
other
relief.
simultaneously,
with
the
filing
of
a
suit,
he
wrote
a
letter
asking
for
a
hearing
which
was
the
first
indication,
or
request
for
an
entire
period,
no
hearing
was
made,
the
case
proceeded
under
the
court--
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
well
odessa
college
does
not
have
a
tenure
type
of
statement.
although
it
has
adopted
in
part
and
the
declaration
of
policy
of
the
american
association
of
university
professors.
and
had
he
requested
a
hearing
instead
of
placing
the
matter
in
court.
i
have
no
doubt,
that
if
a
hearing
would
have
been
provided,
but
the
college,
the
president
of
the
college
got
the
summons
to
go
to
court
on
the
same
day,
he
got
the
letter
requesting
a
hearing
and
of
course
i
am
sure
it
was
perry.
as
far
as
the
college
was
concerned,
and
we
simply
answered
in
the
forum
in
which
he
had
chosen,
not
to
proceed
and,
we
think
that
we
should
not
be
condemned
for
answering
in
court
and
proceeding
then.
now,
up
on
motion,
the
trial
court
entered
a
summary
judgment
of
all
petitioners
on
grounds
basically
that
the
sindermann
had
neither
a
tenure
or
a
contract,
and
that
his
constitutional
rights
had
not
been
violated.
now
we'll
agree
that
trial
courts
could
have
been
somewhat
more
explicit
in
its
findings,
because
he
made
the
broad
conclusion
that
his
constitutional
rights
had
not
been
violated.
we
think
that
it
isn’t
and
haven't,
and
necessary
and
not
only
permissible
but
inherent
in
that
finding,
that
he
had
to
find
that
either
one,
that
no
hearing
was
necessary
or
that
sindermann
waived
his
right
to
won,
when
he
resorted
to
the
courts
and
that
valid
grounds
for
non-renewal
were
established
as
a
matter
of
law
by
sindermann's
own
pleadings,
in
the
district
court
for
the
western
district.
now,
it
is
on
those
basis
that
we
seek
a
premise
of
the
trial
court's
judgment,
and
we
think
that
if
we
can
make
our
position
clear
on,
the
court
will
concede
while
we
say
the
case
be
affirmed.
first,
about
the
hearing
as
i
have
explained
the
hearing
demand
arrived
with
the
summons,
but
then
sindermann
could
have
asked
for
hearing,
or
he
could
have
proceeded
in
court
--
both
remedies
were
open
to
him.
he
chose
to
do
both
at
the
same
time
and
we
think
knowing
that
the
court’s
action
would
paralyze
any
action
by
the
board.
now
the
choice
was
his.
he
made
this
election
not
the
college.
the
college
responded
in
the
court
where
he
felt
it
had
(inaudible).
now
we
don't
think
they
should
be
to
contempt
with
it
and
we
think
the
trial
court
had
a
right
under
those
circumstances
which
were
appeared
in
the
pleadings,
had
a
right
to
say
that
he
had
waived
his
right
to
a
hearing.
now,
probably
what
is
more
compelling
from
a
record
in
this
case,
is
that
when
you
look
at
the
basis
on
which
the
case
was
handled
in
the
trial
court,
you
can
see
that
there
is
no
necessity
for
a
hearing
in
this
case,
if
the
the
board
was
correct
in
finding
adequate
and
valid
and
supporting
grounds
without
dispute.
already
established
the
purpose
of
a
hearing
is
to
determine
the
existence
of
facts.
if
there
is
no
dispute
about
the
facts,
then
there
is
--
it
is
certainly
a
useless
thing
to
hold
a
hearing
to
determine
facts
that
are
already
undisputed,
and
without
any
controversy
in
the
case.
in
this
case
sindermann
himself
pleaded
that
he
had
been
insubordinate
and
that
he
had
violated
the
directions
and
instructions
of
his
dean
and
his
president,
on
not
one
but
on
several
occasions
and
be
specifically
and
in
detail
on
two.
now,
we
think
he
is
bound
under
the
rules
of
any
court
by
his
pleadings
upon
which
he
relies
as
to
set
forth
his
cause
of
action,
and
when
he
pleads
them
thinks
himself
that,
that
establishes
that
fact.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
your
honor--
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
yes
your
honor,
i
am
going
and
i
think
if
i
maybe
allowed
to
lay
this
foundation
briefly,
i
am
going
to
take
issues
where
the
proposition
that
where
valid,
legitimate,
honest,
full
of
grounds
for
dismissal
are
established
without
any
dispute
in
the
evidence
and
without
any
controversy,
that
a
concurrent
plead
of
impermissible
ground
is
not
and
should
not
be
controlling
or
required
credit
if
that
is
going
to
reach
upon.
i
am
getting
to
that
as
fast
as
i
can
be.
now
i
do
think
it
is
appropriate
here,
for
me
to
say
that
in
jones
versus
parker,
the
tenth
circuit,
the
fourth
circuit
in
parker
versus
the
the
board
of
education.
these
cases
have
held
that
a
non-tenured
teacher,
in
a
non-tenured
school
and
in
a
non-tenured
state
and
college.
upon
expiration
of
this
contract
has
no
right
to
a
hearing.
the
first
circuit
i
believe
in
brown
may
have
joined
them
in
that
view
but
said
you
ought
to
have
a
state.
now
we
fit
squarely
under
those
cases
and
if
those
cases
have
directly
declared
the
law,
then
our
argument
is
over
because
we
fit
under
that
clause
and
would
be
protected
under
it.
but
we
do
not
think
we
are,
and
we
are
not
here
saying
that
that
is
enough
because
we
don't
have
to,
and
our
facts
go
beyond
the
holdings
in
those
cases
and
we
say
that
whether
it
is
contractual
or
not,
is
not
the
point
here,
we
go
beyond.
we
think
we
have
adequate
grounds
under
the
rule
that
we
propose
as
being
the
only
possible
rule,
that
the
court
can
adopt
and
that
colleges
and
boards
and
regents
in
this
country
can
live
with.
and
in
this
rule,
and
this
rule
that
we
say
we
have
to
have
for
our
survival
is
that
point
adequate
full
and
proper
grounds,
i
not
talking
about
the
disputed
grounds
i
am
not
talking
about
the
pretext.
i
am
not
talking
about
matters
incidental,
the
length
of
the
hair,
the
length
of
the
skirts,
it
might
vary
from
school
to
school
or
from
place
to
place.
i
am
talking
about
insubordination.
i
am
talking
about
disruption
and
harmony
among
the
colleagues
incompetence,
and
inefficiency,
basic
sound
grounds.
and
we
say
when
those
have
been
established
the
inquiry
is
over
and
that
if
there
is
a
concurrent
claim
made
of
impermissible
reasons
that
those
failed
in
the
contrast.
now
the
reason
is
--
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
i
am
sorry
i
didn't
see
the
time.
your
honor.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
the
court
please.
it
maybe
best
at
this
point
to
define
activity
that
we
are
talking
about
so
that
to
clarify
the
point.
sindermann
asked
for
and
was
refused
permission
to
leave
his
duty
post
go
to
the
state
capital
to
lobby,
in
support
of
certain
legislation
in
which
he
was
interested.
now
as
far
as,
well
as
odessa
college
is
concerned,
he
was
and
he
is
and
will
forever
be
free
to
support
any
legislation
that
he
chooses.
what
we
say
say
that
he
was
not
free
to
do,
was
to
leave
his
duty
post
contrary
to
the
instructions
and
directions
of
the
chairman
of
his
department,
his
dean
and
his
president
and
go
some
300
to
400
miles
away
at
his
convenience
and
at
his
choice
to
lobby
in
support
of
that
legislation.
now,
whether
the
free
support
of
legislation
is
protected,
really
we
don't
think
is
the
question.
here,
we
think
that
the
critical
question
is
whether
he
can
go
300
or
400
miles
away
at
a
time
of
his
choice,
contrary
to
instructions
of
his
superiors
and
lobby
lobby
at
his
convenience
in
support
of
legislation
in
which
he
is
interested.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
we
think
on
balance,
may
your
honor
please
that
the
compelling
job,
which
he
has
hired
out
to
do,
which
is
to
teach
his
classes
must
outweigh
his
own
convenience
in
going
or
wherever
he
chooses
at
his
convenience
and
at
a
time
which
he
selects
to
lobby
in
favor
our
legislation.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
i
think
that
would
be
a
decision
that
his
superiors
would
have
to
reach
again
on
balance
as
to
the
benefit
to
the
college
and
the
students
and
as
compared
to
him.
certainly,
we
would
have
a
constitutional
and
a
protective
right
to
go.
that
would
be
a
matter
of
his
choice,
but
this
court
has
said
and
if
i
agree
that
this
is
a
delicate
balance
and
that
the
care
must
be
used
to
preserve
that
autonomy
of
the
board
to
maintain
discipline,
competency,
efficiency
and
at
least
an
orderly
administration
of
a
college.
the
problem
your
honor
is
to
look
at
your
question
as
to
one
professor,
but
suppose
on
that
same,
250
professors
or
half
the
faculty
also
wanted
to
go
and
hear
the
lecture,
and
also
wanted
to
lobbying
at
the
legislature,
then
how
do
you
choose
each
one
would
have
an
equal
right
to
go;
you
couldn’t
say
one
man
had
a
superior
constitutional
right
to
go
to
the
legislature
and
lobby,
but
what
are
you
going
to
do,
shut
down
the
college?
no,
you
have
students
who
came
to
get
some
education,
you
have
professors
who
have
been
hired
out
to
teach
and
this
is
the
point
we
make
your
honor,
when
we
say
that
on
balance,
this
is
not
a
matter
of
choice
of
the
professor
to
go
to
a
state
capital
once.
this
perhaps
arose
some
four
times
and
he
went
on
two
occasions,
testified
on
the
legislation
in
which
he
was
interested
on
neither
occasion.
the
fifth
circuit
summarily
held
that
this
was
just
a
protected
right
and
really
did
not
discuss
the
matter
but
we
think
respondent
recognizes
the
problem
quite
well,
because
in
a
respondent's
brief,
he
classifies
it
as
a
grey
area,
upon
which
some
balancing
is
needed
and
when
you
are
in
the
grey
area,
if
that's
what
it
is,
we
think
the
actions
of
sindermann
himself
may
well
be
determining
of
the
importance
of
the
problem.
now
listen,
bear
in
mind
that
sindermann
himself
approached
his
superiors
and
requested
permission
to
go,
he
just
didn't
leave
and
go.
he
came
and
asked,
realized
that
this
was
an
area
in
which
he
might
be
refused
permission,
otherwise
why
ask,
why
not
just
go.
they
argue
in
their
brief
that
the
faculty
guide
says
that
all
he
had
a
right
to
expect
was
on
an
unexcused
absence;
a
deduction
of
118
of
his
pay.
well,
you
see,
we
get
out
of
unexcused
absences.
this
is
not
just
an
unexcused
absence.
this
is
an
absent,
which
occurs
in
direct
contradiction
to
his
superiors.
if
he
just
takes
off
the
leaves,
we
have
an
unexcused
absence.
this
man
sought
permission,
was
refused
permission
and
disregarded
and
went
anyway.
well
--
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
about
2000,
if
the
count
would
be
less,
count
the
night
students
too.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
say
about
200,
300.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
yes,
your
honor,
may
be
six
or
eight.
now
i
guess
what
we
are
saying
is
the
opposite
of
what
respondent
contends
that
the
rule
should
be.
they
say
that
a
bond
termination
or
a
bond
non-renewal.
if
there
is
a
claim
and
bear
in
mind
your
honors,
i'm
talking
about
a
claim.
if
there
is
a
claim
of
impermissible
reasons,
then
you
must
go
into
that
matter
with
a
hearing
and
with
full
procedural
due
process.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
yes
your
honor,
now
this
is
what
that
contention
is.
he
finds
some
support,
kruger
(ph)
versus
alabama
by
the
fifth
circuit
says
that.
now
this
case
has
--
very
well
might
be
construed
in
saying
that.
but
let
me
try
to
explain
why,
we
say
that
can’t
run,
you
see
if
that's
true,
then
it
is
a
matter
of
job
securing
for
any
professor
or
any
faculty
without
tenure
to
take
any
administration
positions,
to
amend
the
administration
in
areas
of
grey,
or
whatever
black,
or
black
or
green.
because
then,
if
he
is
aware
of
his
derelictions
and
he
knows
his
contract
may
not
be
renewed,
immediately
upon
notification,
all
he
does
is
make
the
claim.
it
doesn't
matter
about
the
validity
of
the
grounds
because
he
makes
the
claim,
then
we
are
in
the
hearing
business,
then
the
court
is
under
--
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
then
i
think
the
trial
court
is
going
to
have
to
hear
some
testimony.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
yes,
if
he
does
not
plead
that
as
far
or
mr.
justice,
if
we
have
disputed
ground.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
i
am
talking
only
about
grounds
established
as
a
matter
of
law
at
valid
legitimate
grounds.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
then
we
are
going
to
have
to
have
some
testimony.
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
to
determine
what
we
say
has
already
been
placed.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
yes
sir,
i
agree
with
that.
well,
i
tried
to
distinguish
ourselves
and
i
hope
to
do
so
clearly
because
when
i
say
the
facts
of
the
non-renewal
on
valid
sign,
not
foolish
ground.
i
am
talking
sound
grounds,
then
i
say
the
inquiry
is
open
and
i
say
that
is
the
only
reason
they
did
not
--
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
yes
sir.
two
motions
were
filed.
we
plead
what
we
are
now
saying
to
the
court
that
compliant
----
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
yes
sir
and
we
say
that
it
was
appropriate
remedy
in
this
case
mr.
justice
simply
because
--
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
oh
yes
sir,
i
know
that.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
well,
we
say
that
that
should
not
occur
where
valid,
solid
and
please
mr.
justice,
i
am
not
talking
about
foolish
grounds,
i
am
talking
about
basic
grounds
such
as
involved
discipline
and
competency
when
those
are
established
as
a
matter
of
law,
we
say
what
is
the
necessity
of
going
to
have
a
hearing
to
see
if
that
ground
has
already
been
established
when
it
is
played
and
there
is
no
dispute
about
it.
this
is
the
reason
that
we
say
mr.
justice,
that
then
a
concurrent
plan,
our
first
amendment
suppression
in
the
face
of
a
valid
ground,
is
no
longer
need
to
be
examined
because
if
you
did
so,
you
get
in
to
the
proposition
of
where
it
is
a
situation
of
job
security.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
yes
sir,
we
think
the
pleadings
are
there
and
the
reason
we
feel
a
little
more
secure,
than
if
we
had
a
record
of
some
testimony
or
some
affidavits.
mr.
justice,
it
is
that
in
this
case,
we
rely
on
mr.
sindermann's
own
pleadings.
well,
there
is
no
question
about
the
--
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
well,
yes
sir,
if
i
am
correct
in
my
position
which
i,
you
say
i
am
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
spectrum.
that
is
what
they
say.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
insubordination.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
yes.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
no,
sir,
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
we
were
guilty
of
sophistry
i
believe
is
the
term,
your
honor,
and
that
they
took
the
position
that
a
forbidding
of
the
exercised
first
amendment
right
and
then
after
a
violation
of
the
instructs,
and
holding
that
to
be
insubordination
was
simply
a
pretext
or
a
worn
out
pretext
but
we
are
--
we
don't
agree,
we
think
that
they
missed
the
mark,
when
they
didn't
consider
to
some
way
the
balance
of
the
problem
involved
of
going
at
his
convenience
and
we
get
back
to
the
same
problem
of
200
professors
going
to
austin
are
happy,
that
this
must
we
think,
of
necessity
to
be
a
matter
of
control.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
no
sir.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
well,
i
think
if
we
are
sitting
down
on
a
principle
which
is
being
urged
as
was
in
the
fifth
circuit,
mr.
justice
that
you
have
to
look
at
both
sides
of
the
possibility.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
well,
i
suppose
if
we'd
gone
ahead
and
gone
on
to
the
trial
that
we'd
have
been
--
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
either
there
or
all
the
way
up
here,
one
of
the
two.
we've
had
a
full
record
--
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
yes
sir,
i
think
it
is
appropriate
--
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
yes,
and
for
the
reasons
which
i
hope
to
have
made
clear
because
of
the
question
of
opposite
end
of
the
spectrum,
simply
means
you
encourage
anti-administration
activities,
a
fight
with
your
superiors,
those
are
the
things,
then
in
that
place
you
get
an
excellent
position
if
your
employment
is
terminated,
we
don't
think
that
the
law
is
designed,
mr.
justice
to
create
dissent.
we
think
it
ought
to
be
designed.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
we
simply
do
not
add
--
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
well,
we
think
it's
something
more
than
a
hearing.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
mr.
justice,
but
we
think
that
the
pleadings
determine
the
case,
the
hearing
thing
to
us
goes
up
because
simply,
we
say
the
facts
had
been
established
--
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
no,
sir.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
did
you
said
could
they
be
or
are
they?
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
i
am
sure
with
permission
of
the
court,
no
question
about
it
mr.
justice.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
if
i
have
responded
in
other
terms,
i
was
afraid
i
was
going
to
use
the
term
indiscriminately
and
i
notice
that,
apologetically
that
some
of
the
justices
have
too,
so
i
have
only
responded
as
a
track
that
we
are
talking
about
a
non-renewal.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
i
am
sure
that
i
have.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
usually
i
carry
a
coke
box
to
take
care
of
that
difference.
petitioners
in
this
case
are
the
president
and
the
board
of
regents
of
odessa
college,
a
small
town
in
west
texas.
the
respondent,
sindermann
was
a
teacher
employed
on
a
year
to
year
contract,
which
had
it's
expiration
was
not
renewed.
termination
did
not
occur
during
the
contract
term.
before
the
term
date
actually
expired
and
before
official
notice
that
it
would
not
be
renewed,
he
claimed
he
was
fired
for
anti-administration
activity.
the
president
of
this
college
also
had
about
simultaneous
with
the
notification
of
non-renewal,
issued
a
press
release
in
which
he
detailed
the
activities,
and
as
we
read
in
this
claim
that
it
had
any
thing
to
do
with
his
discharge.
but
it
is
set
out
in
detail,
what
we
considered
to
be,
too
precise,
valid
and
legitimate
grounds
for
non-renewal
which
included
one;
persistent
insubordination
and
two;
a
disruption
of
harmony,
among
his
colleagues,
by
the
way
of
harassment.
now,
we
don't
know
of
any
decisions
that
says
that
either
of
those
situations,
or
invalid
as
grounds
for
dismissal,
three
days
and
with
a
notification--
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
it
is
a
non-renewal,
mr.
justice
and
i
debate
in
terms
of
termination
and
i
may
slip
and
say
discharge,
i
do
hope
to
make
it
clear
that
it
was
a
year-to-year
contract.
it
was
not
renewed
at
the
expiration
of
the
contract.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
yes,
it
is
a
failure
to
renew
or
give
him
another
contract.
these
are
year-to-year
contracts,
and
what
we
present
here
as
a
non-tenure
college
in
a
non-tenure
state
and
with
a
non-tenure
profession.
and
if
i
say
termination,
and
i
mean
to
say
non-renewal.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
no
sir,
we
do
not.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
yes,
well,
and
i
guess
you
would
say
pro-professor,
yes
sir,
this
is
a
junior
college
and--
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
yes,
sir
a
two
year
college.
so
we
don't
have
chairs
and
things
of
that
types
of
that
nature,
if
you
would
find
in
a
ford
university.
i
do
hope
to
make
that
clear
though
i
may
have
used
that
term,
i
don't
mean
to,
i
will
try
not
to.
three
days
after,
he
had
notice
of
the
non-renewal,
sindermann
filed
a
suit
in
the
federal
court
in
our
area
for
$475000
of
damages,
and
seeking
various
other
relief.
simultaneously,
with
the
filing
of
a
suit,
he
wrote
a
letter
asking
for
a
hearing
which
was
the
first
indication,
or
request
for
an
entire
period,
no
hearing
was
made,
the
case
proceeded
under
the
court--
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
well
odessa
college
does
not
have
a
tenure
type
of
statement.
although
it
has
adopted
in
part
and
the
declaration
of
policy
of
the
american
association
of
university
professors.
and
had
he
requested
a
hearing
instead
of
placing
the
matter
in
court.
i
have
no
doubt,
that
if
a
hearing
would
have
been
provided,
but
the
college,
the
president
of
the
college
got
the
summons
to
go
to
court
on
the
same
day,
he
got
the
letter
requesting
a
hearing
and
of
course
i
am
sure
it
was
perry.
as
far
as
the
college
was
concerned,
and
we
simply
answered
in
the
forum
in
which
he
had
chosen,
not
to
proceed
and,
we
think
that
we
should
not
be
condemned
for
answering
in
court
and
proceeding
then.
now,
up
on
motion,
the
trial
court
entered
a
summary
judgment
of
all
petitioners
on
grounds
basically
that
the
sindermann
had
neither
a
tenure
or
a
contract,
and
that
his
constitutional
rights
had
not
been
violated.
now
we'll
agree
that
trial
courts
could
have
been
somewhat
more
explicit
in
its
findings,
because
he
made
the
broad
conclusion
that
his
constitutional
rights
had
not
been
violated.
we
think
that
it
isn’t
and
haven't,
and
necessary
and
not
only
permissible
but
inherent
in
that
finding,
that
he
had
to
find
that
either
one,
that
no
hearing
was
necessary
or
that
sindermann
waived
his
right
to
won,
when
he
resorted
to
the
courts
and
that
valid
grounds
for
non-renewal
were
established
as
a
matter
of
law
by
sindermann's
own
pleadings,
in
the
district
court
for
the
western
district.
now,
it
is
on
those
basis
that
we
seek
a
premise
of
the
trial
court's
judgment,
and
we
think
that
if
we
can
make
our
position
clear
on,
the
court
will
concede
while
we
say
the
case
be
affirmed.
first,
about
the
hearing
as
i
have
explained
the
hearing
demand
arrived
with
the
summons,
but
then
sindermann
could
have
asked
for
hearing,
or
he
could
have
proceeded
in
court
--
both
remedies
were
open
to
him.
he
chose
to
do
both
at
the
same
time
and
we
think
knowing
that
the
court’s
action
would
paralyze
any
action
by
the
board.
now
the
choice
was
his.
he
made
this
election
not
the
college.
the
college
responded
in
the
court
where
he
felt
it
had
(inaudible).
now
we
don't
think
they
should
be
to
contempt
with
it
and
we
think
the
trial
court
had
a
right
under
those
circumstances
which
were
appeared
in
the
pleadings,
had
a
right
to
say
that
he
had
waived
his
right
to
a
hearing.
now,
probably
what
is
more
compelling
from
a
record
in
this
case,
is
that
when
you
look
at
the
basis
on
which
the
case
was
handled
in
the
trial
court,
you
can
see
that
there
is
no
necessity
for
a
hearing
in
this
case,
if
the
the
board
was
correct
in
finding
adequate
and
valid
and
supporting
grounds
without
dispute.
already
established
the
purpose
of
a
hearing
is
to
determine
the
existence
of
facts.
if
there
is
no
dispute
about
the
facts,
then
there
is
--
it
is
certainly
a
useless
thing
to
hold
a
hearing
to
determine
facts
that
are
already
undisputed,
and
without
any
controversy
in
the
case.
in
this
case
sindermann
himself
pleaded
that
he
had
been
insubordinate
and
that
he
had
violated
the
directions
and
instructions
of
his
dean
and
his
president,
on
not
one
but
on
several
occasions
and
be
specifically
and
in
detail
on
two.
now,
we
think
he
is
bound
under
the
rules
of
any
court
by
his
pleadings
upon
which
he
relies
as
to
set
forth
his
cause
of
action,
and
when
he
pleads
them
thinks
himself
that,
that
establishes
that
fact.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
your
honor--
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
yes
your
honor,
i
am
going
and
i
think
if
i
maybe
allowed
to
lay
this
foundation
briefly,
i
am
going
to
take
issues
where
the
proposition
that
where
valid,
legitimate,
honest,
full
of
grounds
for
dismissal
are
established
without
any
dispute
in
the
evidence
and
without
any
controversy,
that
a
concurrent
plead
of
impermissible
ground
is
not
and
should
not
be
controlling
or
required
credit
if
that
is
going
to
reach
upon.
i
am
getting
to
that
as
fast
as
i
can
be.
now
i
do
think
it
is
appropriate
here,
for
me
to
say
that
in
jones
versus
parker,
the
tenth
circuit,
the
fourth
circuit
in
parker
versus
the
the
board
of
education.
these
cases
have
held
that
a
non-tenured
teacher,
in
a
non-tenured
school
and
in
a
non-tenured
state
and
college.
upon
expiration
of
this
contract
has
no
right
to
a
hearing.
the
first
circuit
i
believe
in
brown
may
have
joined
them
in
that
view
but
said
you
ought
to
have
a
state.
now
we
fit
squarely
under
those
cases
and
if
those
cases
have
directly
declared
the
law,
then
our
argument
is
over
because
we
fit
under
that
clause
and
would
be
protected
under
it.
but
we
do
not
think
we
are,
and
we
are
not
here
saying
that
that
is
enough
because
we
don't
have
to,
and
our
facts
go
beyond
the
holdings
in
those
cases
and
we
say
that
whether
it
is
contractual
or
not,
is
not
the
point
here,
we
go
beyond.
we
think
we
have
adequate
grounds
under
the
rule
that
we
propose
as
being
the
only
possible
rule,
that
the
court
can
adopt
and
that
colleges
and
boards
and
regents
in
this
country
can
live
with.
and
in
this
rule,
and
this
rule
that
we
say
we
have
to
have
for
our
survival
is
that
point
adequate
full
and
proper
grounds,
i
not
talking
about
the
disputed
grounds
i
am
not
talking
about
the
pretext.
i
am
not
talking
about
matters
incidental,
the
length
of
the
hair,
the
length
of
the
skirts,
it
might
vary
from
school
to
school
or
from
place
to
place.
i
am
talking
about
insubordination.
i
am
talking
about
disruption
and
harmony
among
the
colleagues
incompetence,
and
inefficiency,
basic
sound
grounds.
and
we
say
when
those
have
been
established
the
inquiry
is
over
and
that
if
there
is
a
concurrent
claim
made
of
impermissible
reasons
that
those
failed
in
the
contrast.
now
the
reason
is
--
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
i
am
sorry
i
didn't
see
the
time.
your
honor.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
the
court
please.
it
maybe
best
at
this
point
to
define
activity
that
we
are
talking
about
so
that
to
clarify
the
point.
sindermann
asked
for
and
was
refused
permission
to
leave
his
duty
post
go
to
the
state
capital
to
lobby,
in
support
of
certain
legislation
in
which
he
was
interested.
now
as
far
as,
well
as
odessa
college
is
concerned,
he
was
and
he
is
and
will
forever
be
free
to
support
any
legislation
that
he
chooses.
what
we
say
say
that
he
was
not
free
to
do,
was
to
leave
his
duty
post
contrary
to
the
instructions
and
directions
of
the
chairman
of
his
department,
his
dean
and
his
president
and
go
some
300
to
400
miles
away
at
his
convenience
and
at
his
choice
to
lobby
in
support
of
that
legislation.
now,
whether
the
free
support
of
legislation
is
protected,
really
we
don't
think
is
the
question.
here,
we
think
that
the
critical
question
is
whether
he
can
go
300
or
400
miles
away
at
a
time
of
his
choice,
contrary
to
instructions
of
his
superiors
and
lobby
lobby
at
his
convenience
in
support
of
legislation
in
which
he
is
interested.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
we
think
on
balance,
may
your
honor
please
that
the
compelling
job,
which
he
has
hired
out
to
do,
which
is
to
teach
his
classes
must
outweigh
his
own
convenience
in
going
or
wherever
he
chooses
at
his
convenience
and
at
a
time
which
he
selects
to
lobby
in
favor
our
legislation.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
i
think
that
would
be
a
decision
that
his
superiors
would
have
to
reach
again
on
balance
as
to
the
benefit
to
the
college
and
the
students
and
as
compared
to
him.
certainly,
we
would
have
a
constitutional
and
a
protective
right
to
go.
that
would
be
a
matter
of
his
choice,
but
this
court
has
said
and
if
i
agree
that
this
is
a
delicate
balance
and
that
the
care
must
be
used
to
preserve
that
autonomy
of
the
board
to
maintain
discipline,
competency,
efficiency
and
at
least
an
orderly
administration
of
a
college.
the
problem
your
honor
is
to
look
at
your
question
as
to
one
professor,
but
suppose
on
that
same,
250
professors
or
half
the
faculty
also
wanted
to
go
and
hear
the
lecture,
and
also
wanted
to
lobbying
at
the
legislature,
then
how
do
you
choose
each
one
would
have
an
equal
right
to
go;
you
couldn’t
say
one
man
had
a
superior
constitutional
right
to
go
to
the
legislature
and
lobby,
but
what
are
you
going
to
do,
shut
down
the
college?
no,
you
have
students
who
came
to
get
some
education,
you
have
professors
who
have
been
hired
out
to
teach
and
this
is
the
point
we
make
your
honor,
when
we
say
that
on
balance,
this
is
not
a
matter
of
choice
of
the
professor
to
go
to
a
state
capital
once.
this
perhaps
arose
some
four
times
and
he
went
on
two
occasions,
testified
on
the
legislation
in
which
he
was
interested
on
neither
occasion.
the
fifth
circuit
summarily
held
that
this
was
just
a
protected
right
and
really
did
not
discuss
the
matter
but
we
think
respondent
recognizes
the
problem
quite
well,
because
in
a
respondent's
brief,
he
classifies
it
as
a
grey
area,
upon
which
some
balancing
is
needed
and
when
you
are
in
the
grey
area,
if
that's
what
it
is,
we
think
the
actions
of
sindermann
himself
may
well
be
determining
of
the
importance
of
the
problem.
now
listen,
bear
in
mind
that
sindermann
himself
approached
his
superiors
and
requested
permission
to
go,
he
just
didn't
leave
and
go.
he
came
and
asked,
realized
that
this
was
an
area
in
which
he
might
be
refused
permission,
otherwise
why
ask,
why
not
just
go.
they
argue
in
their
brief
that
the
faculty
guide
says
that
all
he
had
a
right
to
expect
was
on
an
unexcused
absence;
a
deduction
of
118
of
his
pay.
well,
you
see,
we
get
out
of
unexcused
absences.
this
is
not
just
an
unexcused
absence.
this
is
an
absent,
which
occurs
in
direct
contradiction
to
his
superiors.
if
he
just
takes
off
the
leaves,
we
have
an
unexcused
absence.
this
man
sought
permission,
was
refused
permission
and
disregarded
and
went
anyway.
well
--
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
about
2000,
if
the
count
would
be
less,
count
the
night
students
too.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
say
about
200,
300.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
yes,
your
honor,
may
be
six
or
eight.
now
i
guess
what
we
are
saying
is
the
opposite
of
what
respondent
contends
that
the
rule
should
be.
they
say
that
a
bond
termination
or
a
bond
non-renewal.
if
there
is
a
claim
and
bear
in
mind
your
honors,
i'm
talking
about
a
claim.
if
there
is
a
claim
of
impermissible
reasons,
then
you
must
go
into
that
matter
with
a
hearing
and
with
full
procedural
due
process.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
yes
your
honor,
now
this
is
what
that
contention
is.
he
finds
some
support,
kruger
(ph)
versus
alabama
by
the
fifth
circuit
says
that.
now
this
case
has
--
very
well
might
be
construed
in
saying
that.
but
let
me
try
to
explain
why,
we
say
that
can’t
run,
you
see
if
that's
true,
then
it
is
a
matter
of
job
securing
for
any
professor
or
any
faculty
without
tenure
to
take
any
administration
positions,
to
amend
the
administration
in
areas
of
grey,
or
whatever
black,
or
black
or
green.
because
then,
if
he
is
aware
of
his
derelictions
and
he
knows
his
contract
may
not
be
renewed,
immediately
upon
notification,
all
he
does
is
make
the
claim.
it
doesn't
matter
about
the
validity
of
the
grounds
because
he
makes
the
claim,
then
we
are
in
the
hearing
business,
then
the
court
is
under
--
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
then
i
think
the
trial
court
is
going
to
have
to
hear
some
testimony.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
yes,
if
he
does
not
plead
that
as
far
or
mr.
justice,
if
we
have
disputed
ground.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
i
am
talking
only
about
grounds
established
as
a
matter
of
law
at
valid
legitimate
grounds.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
then
we
are
going
to
have
to
have
some
testimony.
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
to
determine
what
we
say
has
already
been
placed.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
yes
sir,
i
agree
with
that.
well,
i
tried
to
distinguish
ourselves
and
i
hope
to
do
so
clearly
because
when
i
say
the
facts
of
the
non-renewal
on
valid
sign,
not
foolish
ground.
i
am
talking
sound
grounds,
then
i
say
the
inquiry
is
open
and
i
say
that
is
the
only
reason
they
did
not
--
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
yes
sir.
two
motions
were
filed.
we
plead
what
we
are
now
saying
to
the
court
that
compliant
----
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
yes
sir
and
we
say
that
it
was
appropriate
remedy
in
this
case
mr.
justice
simply
because
--
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
oh
yes
sir,
i
know
that.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
well,
we
say
that
that
should
not
occur
where
valid,
solid
and
please
mr.
justice,
i
am
not
talking
about
foolish
grounds,
i
am
talking
about
basic
grounds
such
as
involved
discipline
and
competency
when
those
are
established
as
a
matter
of
law,
we
say
what
is
the
necessity
of
going
to
have
a
hearing
to
see
if
that
ground
has
already
been
established
when
it
is
played
and
there
is
no
dispute
about
it.
this
is
the
reason
that
we
say
mr.
justice,
that
then
a
concurrent
plan,
our
first
amendment
suppression
in
the
face
of
a
valid
ground,
is
no
longer
need
to
be
examined
because
if
you
did
so,
you
get
in
to
the
proposition
of
where
it
is
a
situation
of
job
security.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
yes
sir,
we
think
the
pleadings
are
there
and
the
reason
we
feel
a
little
more
secure,
than
if
we
had
a
record
of
some
testimony
or
some
affidavits.
mr.
justice,
it
is
that
in
this
case,
we
rely
on
mr.
sindermann's
own
pleadings.
well,
there
is
no
question
about
the
--
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
well,
yes
sir,
if
i
am
correct
in
my
position
which
i,
you
say
i
am
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
spectrum.
that
is
what
they
say.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
insubordination.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
yes.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
no,
sir,
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
we
were
guilty
of
sophistry
i
believe
is
the
term,
your
honor,
and
that
they
took
the
position
that
a
forbidding
of
the
exercised
first
amendment
right
and
then
after
a
violation
of
the
instructs,
and
holding
that
to
be
insubordination
was
simply
a
pretext
or
a
worn
out
pretext
but
we
are
--
we
don't
agree,
we
think
that
they
missed
the
mark,
when
they
didn't
consider
to
some
way
the
balance
of
the
problem
involved
of
going
at
his
convenience
and
we
get
back
to
the
same
problem
of
200
professors
going
to
austin
are
happy,
that
this
must
we
think,
of
necessity
to
be
a
matter
of
control.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
no
sir.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
well,
i
think
if
we
are
sitting
down
on
a
principle
which
is
being
urged
as
was
in
the
fifth
circuit,
mr.
justice
that
you
have
to
look
at
both
sides
of
the
possibility.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
well,
i
suppose
if
we'd
gone
ahead
and
gone
on
to
the
trial
that
we'd
have
been
--
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
either
there
or
all
the
way
up
here,
one
of
the
two.
we've
had
a
full
record
--
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
yes
sir,
i
think
it
is
appropriate
--
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
yes,
and
for
the
reasons
which
i
hope
to
have
made
clear
because
of
the
question
of
opposite
end
of
the
spectrum,
simply
means
you
encourage
anti-administration
activities,
a
fight
with
your
superiors,
those
are
the
things,
then
in
that
place
you
get
an
excellent
position
if
your
employment
is
terminated,
we
don't
think
that
the
law
is
designed,
mr.
justice
to
create
dissent.
we
think
it
ought
to
be
designed.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
we
simply
do
not
add
--
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
well,
we
think
it's
something
more
than
a
hearing.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
mr.
justice,
but
we
think
that
the
pleadings
determine
the
case,
the
hearing
thing
to
us
goes
up
because
simply,
we
say
the
facts
had
been
established
--
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
no,
sir.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
did
you
said
could
they
be
or
are
they?
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
i
am
sure
with
permission
of
the
court,
no
question
about
it
mr.
justice.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
if
i
have
responded
in
other
terms,
i
was
afraid
i
was
going
to
use
the
term
indiscriminately
and
i
notice
that,
apologetically
that
some
of
the
justices
have
too,
so
i
have
only
responded
as
a
track
that
we
are
talking
about
a
non-renewal.
mr.
w.
o.
shafer
i
am
sure
that
i
have.
