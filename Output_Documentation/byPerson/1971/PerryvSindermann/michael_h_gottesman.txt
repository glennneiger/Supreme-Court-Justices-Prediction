mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
there
are
more
issues
in
this
case,
than
it
actually
revealed
themselves
so
far
that
before
trying
to
define
what
i
think
are
three
quite
separate
legal
issues
posed
by
this
case.
i
think
a
couple
of
minutes
more
on
the
facts
can
be
helpful.
sindermann
was
a
professor
who
had
been
teaching
in
the
texas
schools
for
10
years,
in
texas
colleges,
so
that
we
don't
have
here
what
you
have
in
the
next
case,
the
roth
case.
the
system
were
there
is
a
tenure
after
so
many
years
and
the
cases
before
you
on
behalf
of
a
probationary
teacher
who
has
been
let
go.
sindermann
had
not
only
been
teaching
for
10
years
in
a
system
which
has
no
tenure,
you
never
get
tenure
but
he
had
been
the
co-chairman
of
his
department,
so
he
was
anything
but
a
probationary
employee.
now
during
his
last
year
of
teaching
that
is
the
year
which
ended
with
his
non-renewal,
he
had
been
active
in
two
causes
which
were
both
very
alive
before
the
texas
legislature.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
suppose
not.
everybody
is
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
correct,
but
why
i
meant
by
that
was
where
you
have
a
tenure
systems,
the
arguments
that
are
made
in
the
roth
case,
are
not
providing
hearings,
is
that
look
we
need
this
time
to
look
these
fellows
over
and
we
do
give
them
the
protections
after
we
weeded
out
those
that
we
don't
think
are
going
to
cut
the
mustard
here.
it's
really
only
a
short
period
of
time
until
they
are
going
to
get
their
tenure,
it's
only
seven
years
mostly.
but
all
of
those
arguments
have
no
application
i'm
saying
to
a
system
and
got
the
legal
argument
here.
the
only
point
i
wanted
to
make
is
there
is
no
tenure
system,
but
sindermann
was
not
somebody
who
was
going
through,
what
we
would
customarily
called
a
probationary
period,
where
they
were
trying
to
decide
whether
or
not
he
meets
the
criteria
for
some
kind
of
continuing
employment.
he
had
been
teaching
there
already
for
10
years
and
he
had
been
the
co-chairman
of
the
department.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
mr.
sindermann
has
been
for
three
years
unable
to
obtain
a
teaching
here
and
indeed
he
has
for
most
of
that
period
unable
to
obtain
any
employment
even
related
to
that.
he
has
been
working
for
a
former
senator.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
a
former
senator
from
the
state
of
texas.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
no,
former
u.s.
senator.
he
has
and
an
affidavit
in
our
brief
reflects,
apply
to
something
like
105
or
110
colleges
and
universities
have
been
unable
to
secure
another
teaching
employment.
we
suggest
there
is
a
relationship
between
his
non-renewal
and
that
fact
which
outcomes
later.
in
any
event
sindermann
was
very
active
in
two
causes.
one
was
an
effort
to
get
tenure
for
the
junior
colleges
of
texas.
he
was
the
president
of
the
association
of
all
of
the
junior
college
teachers
in
texas,
some
42
colleges.
he
had
been
invited,
he'd
been
active
throughout
this
period
writing
letters,
preparing
speeches
and
making
speeches.
he
had
also
been
invited
in
his
capacity
as
president
of
the
texas
junior
college
teachers
association
to
testify
when
that
legislation
was
up
for
hearing
before
the
texas
state
committee.
the
other
course
he
was
involved
in
was
in
community
effort
to
turn
odessa
college
into
a
four-year
college
from
a
junior
college.
most
of
the
people
in
the
community
were
supporting
that
as
what
sindermann,
but
the
board
of
regents
of
the
college
who
would
have
lost
their
positions
as
the
nature
of
the
college
had
changed,
were
opposing
it.
as
a
result
on
both
of
these
issues,
the
tenure
issue
and
the
elevation
of
the
college
issue,
sindermann
was
aligned
with
groups
who
were
supporting
legislature
which
the
college
administrators
would
violently
opposed
it.
both
of
these
bills
came
up
for
hearings
in
the
texas
legislature
within
two
or
three
days
of
each
other.
sindermann
was
invited
by
the
members
of
the
texas
senate
to
testify
on
both.
he
went
to
his
superiors
and
he
said,
“may
i
have
permission
to
go?
the
only
way
i
can
testify,
since
the
legislature
only
sits
during
class
hours.
is
if
i
can
go
and
get
permission
to
be
absent
for
one
day
on
each
occasion.”
he
offered
to
pay
for
the
substitutes
who
would
fill
in
for
his
classes.
the
substitutes
who
were
available
were
people
who
taught
precisely
the
same
courses
at
other
hours
in
the
days.
so,
there
is
no
question
that
they
were
fully
capable
of
teaching
the
course.
they
had
agreed
to
substitute
for
him
and
he
was
prepared
to
pay
them
for
doing
so.
the
college
said,
“no.
you
can't
go.”
and
gave
him
a
long
elaborate
letter
from
the
president
of
the
college
explaining
why
he
couldn't
go.
the
first
reason
in
one
sentence
was,
“we
pay
you
to
teach
not
to
go
lobbying.”
but
then,
they
went
on
with,
“this
isn't
your
job,
you
ought
to
have
a
legislative
man
in
austin
who
can
do
the
testifying
for
your
groups.
we
were
thinking
about
giving
tenure
anyway,
so
there
is
no
reason
why
you
need
to
go
and
testify
on
it.”
quite
plain,
i
think,
the
college
didn't
want
mr.
sindermann
to
be
testifying.
he
did
go,
not
withstanding
their
refusal
to
grant
permission.
he
did
provide
for
substitutes
to
teach
to
classes
and
he
did
offer
to
pay
for
the
substitutes
himself.
not
withstanding
that
a
couple
of
weeks
later,
he
got
advice
from
the
college
that
he
was
not
to
be
renewed
for
the
following
year.
when
rendering
that
advice
they
issued
a
press
release
which
they
furnished
a
copy
off
to
him.
the
press
release
did
not
say
he
was
guilty
of
insubordination,
it
did
not
say
he
was
guilty
of
creating
disharmony
among
his
fellow
colleagues.
the
press
release
recited
the
entire
gamut
of
what
we
would
call
his
first
amendment
activities
that
year.
he
got
involved
in
the
committee
to
get
tenure
and
that
was
unfortunate
and
it
was
in
opposition
to
the
views
of
the
board
of
regents.
he
got
involved
in
the
effort
to
elevate
the
college
and
that
created
a
lot
of
dissension
in
the
community
and
that
was
unfortunate
and
that
was
an
opposition
to
the
position
of
the
board
of
regent.
in
support
of
the
latter
cause,
his
name
appeared
on
a
“disgusting”
ad
which
appears
at
the
end
of
our
brief
and
which
is
quite
innocent.
but
his
name
was
attached
to
a
disgusting
ad
which
supported
the
effort
to
elevate
the
the
college.
though
sindermann
had
told
the
board
of
regents
that
his
name
had
been
put
their
without
his
permission,
he
was
nevertheless
responsible
on
the
theory
of
guilt
by
association.
because
he
had
associated
with
the
group
who
did
publish
the
ad.
then
at
the
end
of
the
group,
his
list
of
--
what
i
would
call
reasons
that
were
being
given,
they
mentioned
the
two
absences.
then
they
said,
the
board
of
trustees
has
been
furnished
the
board
of
regents
has
been
furnished.
the
above
explanation
of
mr.
sindermann's
activities
and
has
expressed
its
disapproval.
indeed
on
that
same
day
though
the
press
release
didn't
say,
that
they
voted
not
to
renew
him.
sindermann
then
came
to
court,
or
i
should
say
before
he
came
court
immediately
from
being
notified
of
his
non-renewal,
he
requested
a
hearing.
he
wrote
a
letter.
he
had
when
he
first
had
inklings
that
he
was
in
trouble.
he
had
previously
requested
that
he
refurnish
the
procedures
with
some
internal
aaup
documents
provide
for
faculty
members,
those
had
been
refused
to
him.
he
was
notified
of
his
non-renewal
without
being
afforded
a
hearing
of
any
kind.
he
wrote
a
letter
saying,
“
can
i
have
a
hearing?”
he
got
no
answer
to
that
letter
and
three
days
later
he
filed
a
law
suit.
now
the
law
suit,
it
has
been
suggested
in
effect
confesses
a
lack
of
claimant.
there
is
nothing
with
the
the
sort.
the
law
suit
recites
sindermann's
active
participation
on
these
two
causes.
it
recites
the
fact
that
he
was
not
renewed.
it
alleges
that
the
reason
he
was
not
renewed
was
that
he
was
taking
positions,
contrary
to
that
of
the
board
of
regents
on
both
pieces
of
legislation.
it
attaches
the
press
release,
as
reflecting
precisely
what
the
complaint
alleged,
namely
on
its
face,
the
press
release
and
the
way
it's
written
and
the
way
it's
structured
suggest
that
all
of
his
activities
played
a
part
in
the
decision
not
to
renew
him.
the
university
then
moved
for
summary
judgment
and
it
did
so
on
a
ground
which
it
is
not
arguing
here
today,
that
it
was
the
ground
on
which
it
sought
certiorari.
the
college
said
“since
his
contract
is
expired
and
since
he
has
no
tenure,
we
have
no
obligation
to
keep
him
or
to
hire
him
again
for
another
year
and
we
can
refuse
to
hire
him
for
reason
whatsoever,
including
the
exercise
of
his
first
amendment
rights,”
for
that
proposition
they
cited
the
decision
of
tenth
circuit
which
held
precisely
that.
“it's
the
only
case
we've
ever
found
that
held
that
what
it
did
it
and
they
cited
that
proposition
and
supported
the
motions
for
summary
judgment.”
the
district
court
apparently
granted
summary
judgment
for
precisely
that
reason.
opinion
recites
1,
2,
3,
4,
he
has
no
tenure,
he
has
no
contract,
he
therefore
has
no
right
to
reemployment.
therefore,
the
complaint
should
be
dismissed.
the
court
of
appeals
of
course,
reversed
that,
pointing
to
the
long
line
of
decisions
by
this
court,
which
established
the
proposition
that
a
teacher
or
a
public
employee
or
anyone
else
for
that
matter
can
not
be
denied,
even
a
privilege
which
the
state
affords.
if
the
reason
for
his
denial
was
that
he
has
exercised
his
first
amendment
right
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
would
think
not,
since
the
--
that
depends
on
whether
the
finance,
the
public
financing
that
the
private
college
gets
would
make
it
state
action.
the
theory
derives
from
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
of
course
requires
state
action.
therefore
you
would
have
to
find
that
the
college's
actions
constitute
state
action
before
you
could
find
that
it's
applicable
to
private
college.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well
this
court
has
held
that
he
would
unless
he
would
want
to
get
involved.
case
called
whitehill
v.
elkins
389
u.s.
54
in
which
this
court
held
that
an
applicant
for
employment
by
a
college
could
not
be
refused
to
employment
because
of
his
prior
exercise
of
his
first
amendment
rights,
to
be
more
precise
because
he
wouldn't
sign
an
oath
assuring
that
he
had
not
belonged
to
certain
organization.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
don't
want
to
get
into
the
too
far
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
no,
i
don't
think,
but
this
court
has
said
that
the
state
can
not
condition
employment.
either
in
the
first
instance
or
continued
employment.
upon
someone
refraining
from
exercising
his
first
amendment
rights.
now,
i
have
got
a
case
where
the
man
has
been
teaching
for
ten
years
and
they've
said
--
we
say
they've
said.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yeah,
i
think
if
a
university
said
to
a
teacher,
you
are
someone
we
would
hire
but
for
the
fact
we
don't
like
your
political
views
or
but
for
the
fact
that
you
support
tenure
or
but
for
the
fact
that
you
got
to
organize
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
or
well,
yeah
that's
right.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
let
me
emphasize
that
under
pickering
this
court
has
suggested
that
there
are
limits
within
which
a
teacher
must
comply
themselves
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
alright,
well
all
i
can
say
is
that
this
court
has
decided
three
cases.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
two
of
them
are
non
renewals
and
the
third
on
an
application
for
employment.
the
two
non-renewal
cases
are
keyishian
and
shelton
v.
tucker,
both
of
which
are
cited
in
our
brief
and
the
job
application
case
is
whitehill
v.
elkins.
though
the
facts
are
different
and
though
we
could
argue
whether
a
particular
statement
of
a
teacher
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
the
principle
of
those
three
cases
clearly
stated
was
that
the
state
can
not
condition
employment,
even
though
it
would
be
a
privilege,
upon
a
teacher's
refraining
from
the
exercise
of
his
first
amendment
rights.
now
the
reason
i
mentioned
picker
is
that
pickering
somewhat
limits
the
scope
of
the
right,
the
first
amendment
rights
available
to
a
teacher.
there
are
certain
instances,
pickering
at
least
suggest
where
a
teacher
might
not
be
allowed
to
speak
and
hold
his
job,
whereas
other
members
of
the
society
might.
for
example,
where
his
criticism
would
go
to
his
immediate
superior.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
pickering
itself
a
dismissal
case.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
right.
now,
i
can
only
say
these
things
about
it.
number
one,
every
single
brief
filed
in
the
roth
case,
which
are
you
going
to
hear
next,
which
includes
the
state
of
wisconsin,
the
state
of
california,
the
state
of
massachusetts,
the
city
of
new
york
and
a
brief
filed
on
behalf
of
“almost
all
the
colleges
and
universities
in
the
united
states”
concedes
this
legal
issue.
every
single
one
of
them
says
we
absolutely
concede
that
a
college
cannot
refuse
to
renew
a
nontenured
teacher
for
another
year,
because
he
has
exercised
his
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well
that
concession
i
think
has
no
point
in
this
court
obviously,
this
court
considered
all
wrong.
what
i
am
suggesting
is
a
long
continuing
unbroken
line
of
decisions
by
this
court,
had
said
something
which
these
briefs
all
reflect.
namely
that
even
and
the
person
who
is
an
applicant
in
the
first
instance
i
think
is
a
somewhat
different
case
than
this.
this
is
management
teaching
of
a
tenure.
but
the
case
is
clearly
established
that
the
man
who
has
been
teaching
here
for
period
of
year,
a
one
year
renewable
contract
each
time
may
not
be
told
this
time
you
shall
not
be
renewed
because
we
don't
like
what
you
are
saying.
for
the
purposes
that
determining
his
protected
rights
under
the
first
amendment,
his
status
is
no
different
than
that
of
a
teacher
in
pickering.
now
to
be
sure
that
doesn't
mean,
he
can
say
anything
he
wants.
it
means,
but
we
are
talking
that
area
of
substantive
statements
which
pickering
says
the
teacher
is
allowed
to
make.
and
our
argument
is
that
it
is
already
been
decided
by
this
court
several
times,
that
a
teacher
can't
be
denied
renewal
for
that
reason.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
i
started
with
a
proposition
that
even
the
applicant
can,
i
mean,
so
analytically
it
shouldn't
make
a
difference,
but
there
is
a
--
it
seems
me
that
there
is
a
obvious
difference.
if
you
start
at
one
end
by
saying
the
man
who
has
in
fact
got
tenure,
whatever
that
means
can't
be
dismissed,
can't
be
dismissed
as
distinguished
from
non
renewal.
but
the
man
who
is
an
applicant
in
the
first
instance,
does
not
have
the
same
right
but
assume
that
hypothetically.
this
man
obviously
falls
somewhere
in
the
middle.
now
what
it
is
that
has
led
this
court
to
say
you
can't
be
dismissed
for
exercising
your
first
amendment
right.
what
led
this
court
to
say
that
is
that
society
has
a
very
important
interest
in
hearing
what
teachers
have
to
say
about
their
colleges
and
universities.
and
if
we
were
going
to
allow
colleges
and
universities
to
dismiss
people
because
of
what
they
say,
then
we
are
going
to
silence
the
people
who
can
most
benefit
society
by
advising
us
with
what's
wrong
with
their
colleges,
how
they
can
be
improved
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
now
that
consideration
is
equally
applicable
to
mr.
sindermann.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
am
sorry.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
oh
absolutely
not.
--
you
have
the
right.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
you
now
have
the
right
not
to
be
fired
for
exercising
your
first
amendment
right.
that's
not
judgment.
i
have
always
understood
tenure
to
be
something
more
than
simply
giving
what
the
first
amendment
gives
you.
tenure
says
you
can't
be
fired
for
any
reason
whatsoever
unless
the
college
undertakes
to
established
that
you've
been
guilty
of
some
reach
of
their
regulations
or
rules
or
obligations.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
does
he
want
a
hearing?
absolutely,
but
it's
not
the
kind
of
hearing
that
would
be
a
tenure
hearing
and
that's
what
i
would
like
to
turn
to
in
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
absolutely.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
if
he
has
never
worked
there
before?
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
oh,
i
think
that
i
have
to
get
into
the
analysis
of
the
hearing
right
to
explain
why
i
think
he
may
not
have
a
right
to
a
hearing
on
that.
there
are
if
we
see
a
two
completely
different
sources
for
the
right
to
a
hearing
of
a
nontenured
teacher.
one
emanates
from
the
first
amendment,
the
other
procedural
due
process
clause.
this
case
and
roth
both
posed
at
least
arguably
first
amendment
consideration
they
seem
to
have
been
implicated
in
the
decision
not
to
renew.
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized
that
assume
with
me
for
the
moment,
this
teacher
does
have
his
first
amendment
right.
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized
that
academic
freedom
or
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights
can
be
chilled,
if
the
state
can
come
along
and
wallop
somebody
to
the
point
where
he
knows
that
can
happen
and
he
says,
well
i
don't
want
that
to
happen
to
me.
i
am
going
to
refrain
from
the
exercise
of
my
rights
and
because
of
that
this
court
is
recognized
as
it
sometimes
put
it
that
the
freedoms
of
expression
must
be
surrounded
by
necessary
(inaudible)
or
buffers.
procedural
protections
which
will
eliminate
the
chilling
effect,
which
would
otherwise
exist
in
the
exercise
of
such
rights.
now
in
the
case
of
a
university
teacher
who
does
not
have
tenure,
if
the
college
has
the
right
to
deny
him
renewal
with
neither
a
statement
of
reasons
nor
hearing,
then
every
teacher
says
doing
so.
well,
if
i
say
something
they
don't
like,
all
they
have
got
to
do
is
say
okay
fellow
next
year
no
contract.
now,
the
impact
of
that
on
teachers
unless
they
are
extraordinarily
brave
and
not
concerned
with
whether
they
continue
their
employment
or
not.
the
impact
of
the
knowledge
that
the
college
need
provide
neither
a
statement
of
the
reasons
or
a
hearing,
is
that
teachers
are
going
to
say,
i
better
not
say
anything,
that
they
are
not
going
to
like.
because
if
i
do
i
am
not
going
to
be
working
here
next
year.
now,
all
of
the
amicus
briefs
in
roth
are
very
sensitive
to
this
point.
and
they
acknowledge
that
you
do
need
procedural
protections
because
otherwise
the
first
amendment
rights
will
dry
up
and
vanish.
but
they
say
look
there
is
a
procedural
protection,
if
the
college
fires
the
man
and
if
he
believes
that
the
reason
he
was
fired
was
because
of
things
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
he
can
bring
a
lawsuit
under
section
1983,
and
if
he
wins
he
will
get
back.
well,
we
say
and
we
brief
this
extensively
that
the
availability
of
that
lawsuit
does
not
remove
the
chilling
effect.
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
for
that.
number
one,
if
they
don't
tell
the
teacher
why
he
has
been
fired,
he
doesn't
know
that
he
has
been
fired
because
of
his
freedom
of
expression.
he
is
got
to
bring
a
lawsuit
just
to
find
out,
in
discovering
he
will
find
out
whether
or
not
he
has
got
the
right
to
proceed
with
this
lawsuit.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
am
talking
about
a
non-renewal
case
and
i
am
assuming
for
the
moment
because
that's
our
first
point
and
i
am
assuming
that
a
non-renewed
teacher,
if
the
reason
for
his
non-renewal
is
the
exercise
of
this
first
amendment
rights,
has
in
fact
suffered
a
constitutional
violation
and
that
he
is
entitled
to
reinstatement.
so
that
the
question
comes
how
do
you
enforce
and
protect
that
first
amendment
right?
is
it
sufficient
to
say
that
after
he
is
fired,
he
can
bring
a
lawsuit
or
is
it
necessary
in
order
to
make
those
rights
meaningful
and
not
to
chill
academic
freedom
to
say
that
he
is
got
to
have
a
buffer
between
his
speech
and
the
moment
of
firing
a
procedure
in
which,
the
first
amendment
considerations
will
be
aired
and
debated
and
the
facts
will
be
gathered,
and
he
will
know
that
within
the
academic
community,
before
the
knife
falls
on
his
neck
for
what
he
says
there
will
have
then
a
hearing
in
which
his
position
would
have
been
heard.
and
the
first
amendment
considerations
will
have
been
explored.
now
we
suggest
and
we
detail
them
in
the
brief
and
i
am
not
going
to
have
time
to
go
through
the
full
analysis.
we
suggest
that
simply
having
the
right
to
bring
a
lawsuit
after
you
have
been
fired,
when
you
may
not
even
have
been
told
why
you
have
been
fired.
and
i
use
fired
to
being
non-renewed.
i
have
to
go
make
the
same
concession
that
mr.
shafer
did,
when
i
use
fired
i
mean
non-renewed
in
this
case.
simply
having
the
right
to
bring
the
lawsuit
afterward
is
not
an
adequate
protection
for
first
amendment
rights.
teachers
will
not
regard
it
as
sufficient
protection
to
enrolled
and
then
to
speak,
when
they
know
they
can
simply
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well
it
would
be
adequate
in
the
sense
that
if
the
teacher
could
afford
to
sue
and
could
afford
to
be
unemployed
until
he
wins
because
those
are
the
some
of
the
prospects
he
faces.
it
would
then
be,
but
the
problem
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
right
but
the
hearing
provides
a
buffer
whereby
he
may
talk
them
out
of
it.
for
example,
in
this
case
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever.
that
the
college
was
aware
that
the
first
amendment
had
any
implications
here.
they
seem
to
be
have
proceeded,
because
the
press
releases
were
awfully
candid.
they
seem
to
have
proceeded
without
regard
to
the
fact
that
they
might
have
some
constitutional
obligations.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
depends
what
it
says,
you
mean
if
it
were
remanded
in
the
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
pretty
well,
i
mean
there
will
be
a
remand
for
trial.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
a
trial,
the
fifth
circuit's
decree
that
there
is
got
to
be
a
trial
on
the
right
to
a
hearing.
i
don't
think
that's
particularly
right.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
the
problem
is
the
hearing
at
this
point
the
hearing
doesn't
do
sindermann
very
much
good,
the
people
who
are
going
to
make
the
decision,
they
already
decided
before
they
gave
them
the
hearing.
our
point
is
you
have
got
to
have
a
hearing
before
they
make
the
decision.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
and
our
point
is
that
since
they
denied
sindermann
the
hearing
to
which
we
say
he
was
entitled,
is
entitled
to
reinstatement
and
back
pay
and
we
say
in
a
large
number
of
cases
in
this
court.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
right.
this
court
has
decided
a
number
of
cases
of
which
i
think
the
most
recent
is
green
versus
united
states
where
there
is
a
statutory
procedure
which
has
been
violated.
and
then
the
government
says
well
look
we
don't
have
to
put
them
back
at
least
let's
go
through
the
procedure
now
and
find
out
if
we
had
substantive
grounds
to
justify
what
we
did.
and
this
court
has
said
no,
you
didn't
give
him
the
hearing
when
he
was
entitled
to
and
when
it
would
have
been
meaningful.
therefore
your
action
is
null
and
void
and
it
must
be
set
aside.
you
have
to
put
them
in
back
and
then
if
you
want
to
get
rid
of
them,
you
have
to
give
him
the
hearing
that
he
is
entitled
to.
now,
i
would
like
in
my
remaining
five
minutes
to
get
to
what
is
the
wholly
separate
source
of
what
we
say
are
the
right
to
a
hearing.
our
first
point
stems
from
the
first
amendment.
this
one
stems
from
the
procedural
due
process
concepts
which
have
been
enunciated
by
this
court
in
a
number
of
recent
decisions.
this
court
has
said
that
where
the
state
proposes
to
injure
important
interests
of
one
of
its
citizens,
it
must
first
afford
them
a
hearing
or
some
form
of
procedural
due
process,
unless
the
individuals
need
for
or
the
help
that
he
will
derive
from
the
hearing
is
out
waived
by
the
state's
interest
in
summary
adjudication.
now
the
teacher's
interest
when
he
is
a
teacher
like
sindermann,
i
think
are
clear.
when
he
is
denied
renewal,
number
one,
it
was
his
sole
source
of
income.
this
court
has
many
times
said
what
the
significance
of
that
is.
number
two,
he
loses
the
entire
professional
relationship
that's
developed
with
his
colleagues
in
this
campus.
number
three,
he
confronts
a
problem
which
is
unique
i
think
to
teachers,
almost
invariably
if
he
wants
to
stay
in
this
career,
he
has
got
to
move
to
another
city
because
only
college,
odessa
texas,
if
he
is
going
to
teach
somewhere
else
he
has
got
to
move.
that
means
he
has
got
to
sell
his
house,
he
has
got
to
move,
he
has
got
to
buy
a
new
house,
make
new
friends.
his
entire
life
is
changed
as
a
result
of
a
non-renewal.
and
number
four
the
evidence,
and
we
have
got
it
all
set
out
in
our
brief
is
very
substantial
that
non-renewal
just
doesn't
mean
that
you
don't
teach
in
this
college.
it
means
that
you
don't
teach
again
anywhere.
we
are
now
in
a
period
for
the
first
time
in
the
last
two
or
three
years
and
it's
going
to
continue
of
a
growing
teacher
surplus
in
this
country.
because
of
the
decline
in
the
number
of
people
who
were
--
the
total
population
of
colleges.
nobody
fires
a
teacher
with
a
black
mark
when
there
is
another
teacher
who
doesn't
have
one.
sindermann
has
been
trying
for
three
years
to
get
a
teaching
job.
roth
went
for
a
year
without
a
teaching
job.
and
an
other
case
pending
on
cert,
the
or.
case
he
went
for
a
year
and
half
and
couldn't
get
a
teaching
job.
the
fact
is
when
you
are
non-renewed,
your
career
very
likely
may
come
to
an
end.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes
what
we
are
saying
is
what
you
must
do,
our
concept
of
the
procedure
is,
if
someone
is
recommending
that
you
be
not
renewed
that
you
will
be
advised
that
the
recommendation
and
that
you
be
advised
that
if
you
wish
you
will
be
told
the
reasons
and
afforded
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
now
one
thing
i
want
to
emphasize,
the
main
argument
made
by
the
all
the
parties
in
roth
is
to
what's
wrong
with
this
process
is
that
it's
going
to
take
away
the
college's
discretion
which
they
now
have
in
making
decisions
and
that's
because
they
seem
to
think
that
the
purpose
of
this
hearing
will
be
a
force
to
college
to
prove
the
validity
of
the
reasons
that
it's
assigned
for
the
decision.
and
we
want
to
emphasize
that
the
hearing
as
we
concede
is
not
a
hearing
in
which
the
college
must
prove
the
validity
of
its
reasons.
the
purpose
of
the
hearing
is
literally
what
the
due
process
clause
says,
to
give
the
teacher
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
that
is
to
say
the
college
must
tell
him
in
sufficient
detail
so
that
he
knows
what
he
is
responding
to.
why
they
propose
to
non-renewal?
having
told
him
that
he
then
is
afforded
an
opportunity
to
present
whatever
evidence
he
thinks
will
be
helpful
to
his
cause
to
persuade
them
otherwise.
now,
there
is
no
burden
of
proof
here
and
no
finding
to
be
made.
the
college
will
ultimately
make
the
decision
just
as
they
would
it
before
and
wherever
they
had
discretion,
they
will
still
have
it,
but
at
least
he
will
have
the
benefit
of
putting
before
them
those
facts
and
those
arguments
which
he
thinks
could
persuade
them
to
go
the
other
way.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
only
as
it
now
exists,
the
constitution
does
prescribe
certain
limited
areas
where
the
state
will
exceed
its
discretion
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well
that
exists
now
and
we
insist
that.
i
might
say
we
filed
a
yellow
brief
in
the
roth
case
in
which
we
have
explored
all
of
the
counter
arguments
because
that
case
was
accelerated,
it
was
only
filed
i
think
last
friday
and
the
court
may
not
have
had
a
chance
to
reach
it,
but
it's
the
only
document
i
think
which
systematically
tries
to
respond
to
the
arguments
thrown
up
against
hearings
as
being
burdensome
in
so
and
then
we
urge
the
court
to
see
it.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
there
are
more
issues
in
this
case,
than
it
actually
revealed
themselves
so
far
that
before
trying
to
define
what
i
think
are
three
quite
separate
legal
issues
posed
by
this
case.
i
think
a
couple
of
minutes
more
on
the
facts
can
be
helpful.
sindermann
was
a
professor
who
had
been
teaching
in
the
texas
schools
for
10
years,
in
texas
colleges,
so
that
we
don't
have
here
what
you
have
in
the
next
case,
the
roth
case.
the
system
were
there
is
a
tenure
after
so
many
years
and
the
cases
before
you
on
behalf
of
a
probationary
teacher
who
has
been
let
go.
sindermann
had
not
only
been
teaching
for
10
years
in
a
system
which
has
no
tenure,
you
never
get
tenure
but
he
had
been
the
co-chairman
of
his
department,
so
he
was
anything
but
a
probationary
employee.
now
during
his
last
year
of
teaching
that
is
the
year
which
ended
with
his
non-renewal,
he
had
been
active
in
two
causes
which
were
both
very
alive
before
the
texas
legislature.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
suppose
not.
everybody
is
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
correct,
but
why
i
meant
by
that
was
where
you
have
a
tenure
systems,
the
arguments
that
are
made
in
the
roth
case,
are
not
providing
hearings,
is
that
look
we
need
this
time
to
look
these
fellows
over
and
we
do
give
them
the
protections
after
we
weeded
out
those
that
we
don't
think
are
going
to
cut
the
mustard
here.
it's
really
only
a
short
period
of
time
until
they
are
going
to
get
their
tenure,
it's
only
seven
years
mostly.
but
all
of
those
arguments
have
no
application
i'm
saying
to
a
system
and
got
the
legal
argument
here.
the
only
point
i
wanted
to
make
is
there
is
no
tenure
system,
but
sindermann
was
not
somebody
who
was
going
through,
what
we
would
customarily
called
a
probationary
period,
where
they
were
trying
to
decide
whether
or
not
he
meets
the
criteria
for
some
kind
of
continuing
employment.
he
had
been
teaching
there
already
for
10
years
and
he
had
been
the
co-chairman
of
the
department.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
mr.
sindermann
has
been
for
three
years
unable
to
obtain
a
teaching
here
and
indeed
he
has
for
most
of
that
period
unable
to
obtain
any
employment
even
related
to
that.
he
has
been
working
for
a
former
senator.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
a
former
senator
from
the
state
of
texas.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
no,
former
u.s.
senator.
he
has
and
an
affidavit
in
our
brief
reflects,
apply
to
something
like
105
or
110
colleges
and
universities
have
been
unable
to
secure
another
teaching
employment.
we
suggest
there
is
a
relationship
between
his
non-renewal
and
that
fact
which
outcomes
later.
in
any
event
sindermann
was
very
active
in
two
causes.
one
was
an
effort
to
get
tenure
for
the
junior
colleges
of
texas.
he
was
the
president
of
the
association
of
all
of
the
junior
college
teachers
in
texas,
some
42
colleges.
he
had
been
invited,
he'd
been
active
throughout
this
period
writing
letters,
preparing
speeches
and
making
speeches.
he
had
also
been
invited
in
his
capacity
as
president
of
the
texas
junior
college
teachers
association
to
testify
when
that
legislation
was
up
for
hearing
before
the
texas
state
committee.
the
other
course
he
was
involved
in
was
in
community
effort
to
turn
odessa
college
into
a
four-year
college
from
a
junior
college.
most
of
the
people
in
the
community
were
supporting
that
as
what
sindermann,
but
the
board
of
regents
of
the
college
who
would
have
lost
their
positions
as
the
nature
of
the
college
had
changed,
were
opposing
it.
as
a
result
on
both
of
these
issues,
the
tenure
issue
and
the
elevation
of
the
college
issue,
sindermann
was
aligned
with
groups
who
were
supporting
legislature
which
the
college
administrators
would
violently
opposed
it.
both
of
these
bills
came
up
for
hearings
in
the
texas
legislature
within
two
or
three
days
of
each
other.
sindermann
was
invited
by
the
members
of
the
texas
senate
to
testify
on
both.
he
went
to
his
superiors
and
he
said,
“may
i
have
permission
to
go?
the
only
way
i
can
testify,
since
the
legislature
only
sits
during
class
hours.
is
if
i
can
go
and
get
permission
to
be
absent
for
one
day
on
each
occasion.”
he
offered
to
pay
for
the
substitutes
who
would
fill
in
for
his
classes.
the
substitutes
who
were
available
were
people
who
taught
precisely
the
same
courses
at
other
hours
in
the
days.
so,
there
is
no
question
that
they
were
fully
capable
of
teaching
the
course.
they
had
agreed
to
substitute
for
him
and
he
was
prepared
to
pay
them
for
doing
so.
the
college
said,
“no.
you
can't
go.”
and
gave
him
a
long
elaborate
letter
from
the
president
of
the
college
explaining
why
he
couldn't
go.
the
first
reason
in
one
sentence
was,
“we
pay
you
to
teach
not
to
go
lobbying.”
but
then,
they
went
on
with,
“this
isn't
your
job,
you
ought
to
have
a
legislative
man
in
austin
who
can
do
the
testifying
for
your
groups.
we
were
thinking
about
giving
tenure
anyway,
so
there
is
no
reason
why
you
need
to
go
and
testify
on
it.”
quite
plain,
i
think,
the
college
didn't
want
mr.
sindermann
to
be
testifying.
he
did
go,
not
withstanding
their
refusal
to
grant
permission.
he
did
provide
for
substitutes
to
teach
to
classes
and
he
did
offer
to
pay
for
the
substitutes
himself.
not
withstanding
that
a
couple
of
weeks
later,
he
got
advice
from
the
college
that
he
was
not
to
be
renewed
for
the
following
year.
when
rendering
that
advice
they
issued
a
press
release
which
they
furnished
a
copy
off
to
him.
the
press
release
did
not
say
he
was
guilty
of
insubordination,
it
did
not
say
he
was
guilty
of
creating
disharmony
among
his
fellow
colleagues.
the
press
release
recited
the
entire
gamut
of
what
we
would
call
his
first
amendment
activities
that
year.
he
got
involved
in
the
committee
to
get
tenure
and
that
was
unfortunate
and
it
was
in
opposition
to
the
views
of
the
board
of
regents.
he
got
involved
in
the
effort
to
elevate
the
college
and
that
created
a
lot
of
dissension
in
the
community
and
that
was
unfortunate
and
that
was
an
opposition
to
the
position
of
the
board
of
regent.
in
support
of
the
latter
cause,
his
name
appeared
on
a
“disgusting”
ad
which
appears
at
the
end
of
our
brief
and
which
is
quite
innocent.
but
his
name
was
attached
to
a
disgusting
ad
which
supported
the
effort
to
elevate
the
the
college.
though
sindermann
had
told
the
board
of
regents
that
his
name
had
been
put
their
without
his
permission,
he
was
nevertheless
responsible
on
the
theory
of
guilt
by
association.
because
he
had
associated
with
the
group
who
did
publish
the
ad.
then
at
the
end
of
the
group,
his
list
of
--
what
i
would
call
reasons
that
were
being
given,
they
mentioned
the
two
absences.
then
they
said,
the
board
of
trustees
has
been
furnished
the
board
of
regents
has
been
furnished.
the
above
explanation
of
mr.
sindermann's
activities
and
has
expressed
its
disapproval.
indeed
on
that
same
day
though
the
press
release
didn't
say,
that
they
voted
not
to
renew
him.
sindermann
then
came
to
court,
or
i
should
say
before
he
came
court
immediately
from
being
notified
of
his
non-renewal,
he
requested
a
hearing.
he
wrote
a
letter.
he
had
when
he
first
had
inklings
that
he
was
in
trouble.
he
had
previously
requested
that
he
refurnish
the
procedures
with
some
internal
aaup
documents
provide
for
faculty
members,
those
had
been
refused
to
him.
he
was
notified
of
his
non-renewal
without
being
afforded
a
hearing
of
any
kind.
he
wrote
a
letter
saying,
“
can
i
have
a
hearing?”
he
got
no
answer
to
that
letter
and
three
days
later
he
filed
a
law
suit.
now
the
law
suit,
it
has
been
suggested
in
effect
confesses
a
lack
of
claimant.
there
is
nothing
with
the
the
sort.
the
law
suit
recites
sindermann's
active
participation
on
these
two
causes.
it
recites
the
fact
that
he
was
not
renewed.
it
alleges
that
the
reason
he
was
not
renewed
was
that
he
was
taking
positions,
contrary
to
that
of
the
board
of
regents
on
both
pieces
of
legislation.
it
attaches
the
press
release,
as
reflecting
precisely
what
the
complaint
alleged,
namely
on
its
face,
the
press
release
and
the
way
it's
written
and
the
way
it's
structured
suggest
that
all
of
his
activities
played
a
part
in
the
decision
not
to
renew
him.
the
university
then
moved
for
summary
judgment
and
it
did
so
on
a
ground
which
it
is
not
arguing
here
today,
that
it
was
the
ground
on
which
it
sought
certiorari.
the
college
said
“since
his
contract
is
expired
and
since
he
has
no
tenure,
we
have
no
obligation
to
keep
him
or
to
hire
him
again
for
another
year
and
we
can
refuse
to
hire
him
for
reason
whatsoever,
including
the
exercise
of
his
first
amendment
rights,”
for
that
proposition
they
cited
the
decision
of
tenth
circuit
which
held
precisely
that.
“it's
the
only
case
we've
ever
found
that
held
that
what
it
did
it
and
they
cited
that
proposition
and
supported
the
motions
for
summary
judgment.”
the
district
court
apparently
granted
summary
judgment
for
precisely
that
reason.
opinion
recites
1,
2,
3,
4,
he
has
no
tenure,
he
has
no
contract,
he
therefore
has
no
right
to
reemployment.
therefore,
the
complaint
should
be
dismissed.
the
court
of
appeals
of
course,
reversed
that,
pointing
to
the
long
line
of
decisions
by
this
court,
which
established
the
proposition
that
a
teacher
or
a
public
employee
or
anyone
else
for
that
matter
can
not
be
denied,
even
a
privilege
which
the
state
affords.
if
the
reason
for
his
denial
was
that
he
has
exercised
his
first
amendment
right
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
would
think
not,
since
the
--
that
depends
on
whether
the
finance,
the
public
financing
that
the
private
college
gets
would
make
it
state
action.
the
theory
derives
from
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
of
course
requires
state
action.
therefore
you
would
have
to
find
that
the
college's
actions
constitute
state
action
before
you
could
find
that
it's
applicable
to
private
college.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well
this
court
has
held
that
he
would
unless
he
would
want
to
get
involved.
case
called
whitehill
v.
elkins
389
u.s.
54
in
which
this
court
held
that
an
applicant
for
employment
by
a
college
could
not
be
refused
to
employment
because
of
his
prior
exercise
of
his
first
amendment
rights,
to
be
more
precise
because
he
wouldn't
sign
an
oath
assuring
that
he
had
not
belonged
to
certain
organization.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
don't
want
to
get
into
the
too
far
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
no,
i
don't
think,
but
this
court
has
said
that
the
state
can
not
condition
employment.
either
in
the
first
instance
or
continued
employment.
upon
someone
refraining
from
exercising
his
first
amendment
rights.
now,
i
have
got
a
case
where
the
man
has
been
teaching
for
ten
years
and
they've
said
--
we
say
they've
said.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yeah,
i
think
if
a
university
said
to
a
teacher,
you
are
someone
we
would
hire
but
for
the
fact
we
don't
like
your
political
views
or
but
for
the
fact
that
you
support
tenure
or
but
for
the
fact
that
you
got
to
organize
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
or
well,
yeah
that's
right.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
let
me
emphasize
that
under
pickering
this
court
has
suggested
that
there
are
limits
within
which
a
teacher
must
comply
themselves
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
alright,
well
all
i
can
say
is
that
this
court
has
decided
three
cases.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
two
of
them
are
non
renewals
and
the
third
on
an
application
for
employment.
the
two
non-renewal
cases
are
keyishian
and
shelton
v.
tucker,
both
of
which
are
cited
in
our
brief
and
the
job
application
case
is
whitehill
v.
elkins.
though
the
facts
are
different
and
though
we
could
argue
whether
a
particular
statement
of
a
teacher
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
the
principle
of
those
three
cases
clearly
stated
was
that
the
state
can
not
condition
employment,
even
though
it
would
be
a
privilege,
upon
a
teacher's
refraining
from
the
exercise
of
his
first
amendment
rights.
now
the
reason
i
mentioned
picker
is
that
pickering
somewhat
limits
the
scope
of
the
right,
the
first
amendment
rights
available
to
a
teacher.
there
are
certain
instances,
pickering
at
least
suggest
where
a
teacher
might
not
be
allowed
to
speak
and
hold
his
job,
whereas
other
members
of
the
society
might.
for
example,
where
his
criticism
would
go
to
his
immediate
superior.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
pickering
itself
a
dismissal
case.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
right.
now,
i
can
only
say
these
things
about
it.
number
one,
every
single
brief
filed
in
the
roth
case,
which
are
you
going
to
hear
next,
which
includes
the
state
of
wisconsin,
the
state
of
california,
the
state
of
massachusetts,
the
city
of
new
york
and
a
brief
filed
on
behalf
of
“almost
all
the
colleges
and
universities
in
the
united
states”
concedes
this
legal
issue.
every
single
one
of
them
says
we
absolutely
concede
that
a
college
cannot
refuse
to
renew
a
nontenured
teacher
for
another
year,
because
he
has
exercised
his
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well
that
concession
i
think
has
no
point
in
this
court
obviously,
this
court
considered
all
wrong.
what
i
am
suggesting
is
a
long
continuing
unbroken
line
of
decisions
by
this
court,
had
said
something
which
these
briefs
all
reflect.
namely
that
even
and
the
person
who
is
an
applicant
in
the
first
instance
i
think
is
a
somewhat
different
case
than
this.
this
is
management
teaching
of
a
tenure.
but
the
case
is
clearly
established
that
the
man
who
has
been
teaching
here
for
period
of
year,
a
one
year
renewable
contract
each
time
may
not
be
told
this
time
you
shall
not
be
renewed
because
we
don't
like
what
you
are
saying.
for
the
purposes
that
determining
his
protected
rights
under
the
first
amendment,
his
status
is
no
different
than
that
of
a
teacher
in
pickering.
now
to
be
sure
that
doesn't
mean,
he
can
say
anything
he
wants.
it
means,
but
we
are
talking
that
area
of
substantive
statements
which
pickering
says
the
teacher
is
allowed
to
make.
and
our
argument
is
that
it
is
already
been
decided
by
this
court
several
times,
that
a
teacher
can't
be
denied
renewal
for
that
reason.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
i
started
with
a
proposition
that
even
the
applicant
can,
i
mean,
so
analytically
it
shouldn't
make
a
difference,
but
there
is
a
--
it
seems
me
that
there
is
a
obvious
difference.
if
you
start
at
one
end
by
saying
the
man
who
has
in
fact
got
tenure,
whatever
that
means
can't
be
dismissed,
can't
be
dismissed
as
distinguished
from
non
renewal.
but
the
man
who
is
an
applicant
in
the
first
instance,
does
not
have
the
same
right
but
assume
that
hypothetically.
this
man
obviously
falls
somewhere
in
the
middle.
now
what
it
is
that
has
led
this
court
to
say
you
can't
be
dismissed
for
exercising
your
first
amendment
right.
what
led
this
court
to
say
that
is
that
society
has
a
very
important
interest
in
hearing
what
teachers
have
to
say
about
their
colleges
and
universities.
and
if
we
were
going
to
allow
colleges
and
universities
to
dismiss
people
because
of
what
they
say,
then
we
are
going
to
silence
the
people
who
can
most
benefit
society
by
advising
us
with
what's
wrong
with
their
colleges,
how
they
can
be
improved
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
now
that
consideration
is
equally
applicable
to
mr.
sindermann.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
am
sorry.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
oh
absolutely
not.
--
you
have
the
right.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
you
now
have
the
right
not
to
be
fired
for
exercising
your
first
amendment
right.
that's
not
judgment.
i
have
always
understood
tenure
to
be
something
more
than
simply
giving
what
the
first
amendment
gives
you.
tenure
says
you
can't
be
fired
for
any
reason
whatsoever
unless
the
college
undertakes
to
established
that
you've
been
guilty
of
some
reach
of
their
regulations
or
rules
or
obligations.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
does
he
want
a
hearing?
absolutely,
but
it's
not
the
kind
of
hearing
that
would
be
a
tenure
hearing
and
that's
what
i
would
like
to
turn
to
in
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
absolutely.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
if
he
has
never
worked
there
before?
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
oh,
i
think
that
i
have
to
get
into
the
analysis
of
the
hearing
right
to
explain
why
i
think
he
may
not
have
a
right
to
a
hearing
on
that.
there
are
if
we
see
a
two
completely
different
sources
for
the
right
to
a
hearing
of
a
nontenured
teacher.
one
emanates
from
the
first
amendment,
the
other
procedural
due
process
clause.
this
case
and
roth
both
posed
at
least
arguably
first
amendment
consideration
they
seem
to
have
been
implicated
in
the
decision
not
to
renew.
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized
that
assume
with
me
for
the
moment,
this
teacher
does
have
his
first
amendment
right.
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized
that
academic
freedom
or
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights
can
be
chilled,
if
the
state
can
come
along
and
wallop
somebody
to
the
point
where
he
knows
that
can
happen
and
he
says,
well
i
don't
want
that
to
happen
to
me.
i
am
going
to
refrain
from
the
exercise
of
my
rights
and
because
of
that
this
court
is
recognized
as
it
sometimes
put
it
that
the
freedoms
of
expression
must
be
surrounded
by
necessary
(inaudible)
or
buffers.
procedural
protections
which
will
eliminate
the
chilling
effect,
which
would
otherwise
exist
in
the
exercise
of
such
rights.
now
in
the
case
of
a
university
teacher
who
does
not
have
tenure,
if
the
college
has
the
right
to
deny
him
renewal
with
neither
a
statement
of
reasons
nor
hearing,
then
every
teacher
says
doing
so.
well,
if
i
say
something
they
don't
like,
all
they
have
got
to
do
is
say
okay
fellow
next
year
no
contract.
now,
the
impact
of
that
on
teachers
unless
they
are
extraordinarily
brave
and
not
concerned
with
whether
they
continue
their
employment
or
not.
the
impact
of
the
knowledge
that
the
college
need
provide
neither
a
statement
of
the
reasons
or
a
hearing,
is
that
teachers
are
going
to
say,
i
better
not
say
anything,
that
they
are
not
going
to
like.
because
if
i
do
i
am
not
going
to
be
working
here
next
year.
now,
all
of
the
amicus
briefs
in
roth
are
very
sensitive
to
this
point.
and
they
acknowledge
that
you
do
need
procedural
protections
because
otherwise
the
first
amendment
rights
will
dry
up
and
vanish.
but
they
say
look
there
is
a
procedural
protection,
if
the
college
fires
the
man
and
if
he
believes
that
the
reason
he
was
fired
was
because
of
things
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
he
can
bring
a
lawsuit
under
section
1983,
and
if
he
wins
he
will
get
back.
well,
we
say
and
we
brief
this
extensively
that
the
availability
of
that
lawsuit
does
not
remove
the
chilling
effect.
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
for
that.
number
one,
if
they
don't
tell
the
teacher
why
he
has
been
fired,
he
doesn't
know
that
he
has
been
fired
because
of
his
freedom
of
expression.
he
is
got
to
bring
a
lawsuit
just
to
find
out,
in
discovering
he
will
find
out
whether
or
not
he
has
got
the
right
to
proceed
with
this
lawsuit.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
am
talking
about
a
non-renewal
case
and
i
am
assuming
for
the
moment
because
that's
our
first
point
and
i
am
assuming
that
a
non-renewed
teacher,
if
the
reason
for
his
non-renewal
is
the
exercise
of
this
first
amendment
rights,
has
in
fact
suffered
a
constitutional
violation
and
that
he
is
entitled
to
reinstatement.
so
that
the
question
comes
how
do
you
enforce
and
protect
that
first
amendment
right?
is
it
sufficient
to
say
that
after
he
is
fired,
he
can
bring
a
lawsuit
or
is
it
necessary
in
order
to
make
those
rights
meaningful
and
not
to
chill
academic
freedom
to
say
that
he
is
got
to
have
a
buffer
between
his
speech
and
the
moment
of
firing
a
procedure
in
which,
the
first
amendment
considerations
will
be
aired
and
debated
and
the
facts
will
be
gathered,
and
he
will
know
that
within
the
academic
community,
before
the
knife
falls
on
his
neck
for
what
he
says
there
will
have
then
a
hearing
in
which
his
position
would
have
been
heard.
and
the
first
amendment
considerations
will
have
been
explored.
now
we
suggest
and
we
detail
them
in
the
brief
and
i
am
not
going
to
have
time
to
go
through
the
full
analysis.
we
suggest
that
simply
having
the
right
to
bring
a
lawsuit
after
you
have
been
fired,
when
you
may
not
even
have
been
told
why
you
have
been
fired.
and
i
use
fired
to
being
non-renewed.
i
have
to
go
make
the
same
concession
that
mr.
shafer
did,
when
i
use
fired
i
mean
non-renewed
in
this
case.
simply
having
the
right
to
bring
the
lawsuit
afterward
is
not
an
adequate
protection
for
first
amendment
rights.
teachers
will
not
regard
it
as
sufficient
protection
to
enrolled
and
then
to
speak,
when
they
know
they
can
simply
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well
it
would
be
adequate
in
the
sense
that
if
the
teacher
could
afford
to
sue
and
could
afford
to
be
unemployed
until
he
wins
because
those
are
the
some
of
the
prospects
he
faces.
it
would
then
be,
but
the
problem
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
right
but
the
hearing
provides
a
buffer
whereby
he
may
talk
them
out
of
it.
for
example,
in
this
case
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever.
that
the
college
was
aware
that
the
first
amendment
had
any
implications
here.
they
seem
to
be
have
proceeded,
because
the
press
releases
were
awfully
candid.
they
seem
to
have
proceeded
without
regard
to
the
fact
that
they
might
have
some
constitutional
obligations.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
depends
what
it
says,
you
mean
if
it
were
remanded
in
the
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
pretty
well,
i
mean
there
will
be
a
remand
for
trial.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
a
trial,
the
fifth
circuit's
decree
that
there
is
got
to
be
a
trial
on
the
right
to
a
hearing.
i
don't
think
that's
particularly
right.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
the
problem
is
the
hearing
at
this
point
the
hearing
doesn't
do
sindermann
very
much
good,
the
people
who
are
going
to
make
the
decision,
they
already
decided
before
they
gave
them
the
hearing.
our
point
is
you
have
got
to
have
a
hearing
before
they
make
the
decision.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
and
our
point
is
that
since
they
denied
sindermann
the
hearing
to
which
we
say
he
was
entitled,
is
entitled
to
reinstatement
and
back
pay
and
we
say
in
a
large
number
of
cases
in
this
court.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
right.
this
court
has
decided
a
number
of
cases
of
which
i
think
the
most
recent
is
green
versus
united
states
where
there
is
a
statutory
procedure
which
has
been
violated.
and
then
the
government
says
well
look
we
don't
have
to
put
them
back
at
least
let's
go
through
the
procedure
now
and
find
out
if
we
had
substantive
grounds
to
justify
what
we
did.
and
this
court
has
said
no,
you
didn't
give
him
the
hearing
when
he
was
entitled
to
and
when
it
would
have
been
meaningful.
therefore
your
action
is
null
and
void
and
it
must
be
set
aside.
you
have
to
put
them
in
back
and
then
if
you
want
to
get
rid
of
them,
you
have
to
give
him
the
hearing
that
he
is
entitled
to.
now,
i
would
like
in
my
remaining
five
minutes
to
get
to
what
is
the
wholly
separate
source
of
what
we
say
are
the
right
to
a
hearing.
our
first
point
stems
from
the
first
amendment.
this
one
stems
from
the
procedural
due
process
concepts
which
have
been
enunciated
by
this
court
in
a
number
of
recent
decisions.
this
court
has
said
that
where
the
state
proposes
to
injure
important
interests
of
one
of
its
citizens,
it
must
first
afford
them
a
hearing
or
some
form
of
procedural
due
process,
unless
the
individuals
need
for
or
the
help
that
he
will
derive
from
the
hearing
is
out
waived
by
the
state's
interest
in
summary
adjudication.
now
the
teacher's
interest
when
he
is
a
teacher
like
sindermann,
i
think
are
clear.
when
he
is
denied
renewal,
number
one,
it
was
his
sole
source
of
income.
this
court
has
many
times
said
what
the
significance
of
that
is.
number
two,
he
loses
the
entire
professional
relationship
that's
developed
with
his
colleagues
in
this
campus.
number
three,
he
confronts
a
problem
which
is
unique
i
think
to
teachers,
almost
invariably
if
he
wants
to
stay
in
this
career,
he
has
got
to
move
to
another
city
because
only
college,
odessa
texas,
if
he
is
going
to
teach
somewhere
else
he
has
got
to
move.
that
means
he
has
got
to
sell
his
house,
he
has
got
to
move,
he
has
got
to
buy
a
new
house,
make
new
friends.
his
entire
life
is
changed
as
a
result
of
a
non-renewal.
and
number
four
the
evidence,
and
we
have
got
it
all
set
out
in
our
brief
is
very
substantial
that
non-renewal
just
doesn't
mean
that
you
don't
teach
in
this
college.
it
means
that
you
don't
teach
again
anywhere.
we
are
now
in
a
period
for
the
first
time
in
the
last
two
or
three
years
and
it's
going
to
continue
of
a
growing
teacher
surplus
in
this
country.
because
of
the
decline
in
the
number
of
people
who
were
--
the
total
population
of
colleges.
nobody
fires
a
teacher
with
a
black
mark
when
there
is
another
teacher
who
doesn't
have
one.
sindermann
has
been
trying
for
three
years
to
get
a
teaching
job.
roth
went
for
a
year
without
a
teaching
job.
and
an
other
case
pending
on
cert,
the
or.
case
he
went
for
a
year
and
half
and
couldn't
get
a
teaching
job.
the
fact
is
when
you
are
non-renewed,
your
career
very
likely
may
come
to
an
end.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes
what
we
are
saying
is
what
you
must
do,
our
concept
of
the
procedure
is,
if
someone
is
recommending
that
you
be
not
renewed
that
you
will
be
advised
that
the
recommendation
and
that
you
be
advised
that
if
you
wish
you
will
be
told
the
reasons
and
afforded
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
now
one
thing
i
want
to
emphasize,
the
main
argument
made
by
the
all
the
parties
in
roth
is
to
what's
wrong
with
this
process
is
that
it's
going
to
take
away
the
college's
discretion
which
they
now
have
in
making
decisions
and
that's
because
they
seem
to
think
that
the
purpose
of
this
hearing
will
be
a
force
to
college
to
prove
the
validity
of
the
reasons
that
it's
assigned
for
the
decision.
and
we
want
to
emphasize
that
the
hearing
as
we
concede
is
not
a
hearing
in
which
the
college
must
prove
the
validity
of
its
reasons.
the
purpose
of
the
hearing
is
literally
what
the
due
process
clause
says,
to
give
the
teacher
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
that
is
to
say
the
college
must
tell
him
in
sufficient
detail
so
that
he
knows
what
he
is
responding
to.
why
they
propose
to
non-renewal?
having
told
him
that
he
then
is
afforded
an
opportunity
to
present
whatever
evidence
he
thinks
will
be
helpful
to
his
cause
to
persuade
them
otherwise.
now,
there
is
no
burden
of
proof
here
and
no
finding
to
be
made.
the
college
will
ultimately
make
the
decision
just
as
they
would
it
before
and
wherever
they
had
discretion,
they
will
still
have
it,
but
at
least
he
will
have
the
benefit
of
putting
before
them
those
facts
and
those
arguments
which
he
thinks
could
persuade
them
to
go
the
other
way.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
only
as
it
now
exists,
the
constitution
does
prescribe
certain
limited
areas
where
the
state
will
exceed
its
discretion
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well
that
exists
now
and
we
insist
that.
i
might
say
we
filed
a
yellow
brief
in
the
roth
case
in
which
we
have
explored
all
of
the
counter
arguments
because
that
case
was
accelerated,
it
was
only
filed
i
think
last
friday
and
the
court
may
not
have
had
a
chance
to
reach
it,
but
it's
the
only
document
i
think
which
systematically
tries
to
respond
to
the
arguments
thrown
up
against
hearings
as
being
burdensome
in
so
and
then
we
urge
the
court
to
see
it.
