justice
william

douglas
from
the
point
of
view
of
this
situation,
this
is
not
a
summary
judgment
case
right?
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
may
eventually
win,
but
the
only
issue
here
is
whether
this
is
a
case
for
a
summary
judgment.
justice
william
o.
douglas
we
have
been
pretty
strict
and
this
court
has

douglas
there
is
first
amendment,
possibilities
of
first
amendment
issue
here,
it
should
be
a
hearing
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
we
agree
with
your
result,
of
course,
the
valid
ground
but
that
is
something
i
don't
imagine
this
court
would
decide.
i
don't
know,
it's
very
difficult
from
this
tangled
record
to
sort
out
the
facts
up
here
for
the
first
time.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
mr.
shafer,
i
have
noticed
that
the
claim
based
on
the
opinion
by
which
mr.
justice
white
referred
to
the
court
also
says
except
the
following
such
procedures
would
be
a
needless
waste
of
time
and
i
got
that
your
whole
argument
is
that
this
is
a
case
where
following
hearing
procedure
would
be
in
the
persuading
time.
justice
william
o.
douglas
basically,
as
i
understand
you
are
arguing
that
in
effect
sindermann
has
pleaded
himself
out
of
the
right
to
a
hearing
because
he
set
up
facts
in
a
pleading
which
established
the
legal
question
that
you
don't
need
a
hearing.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
what
you
say.
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
yet
probably
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
think
this
was
the
case,
where
following
such
procedures
would
be
persuaded.
