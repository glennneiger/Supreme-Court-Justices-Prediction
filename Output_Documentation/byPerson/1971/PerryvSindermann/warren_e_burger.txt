mr.
shafer,
you
may
lower
the
lectern
if
you
would
like
to.
it's
on
the
right
side.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
right
after
lunch
mr.

chief

warren
e.
burger
mr.
shafer
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
does
it
make
any
difference
what
he
is
doing,
when
he's
gone
that
300
or
400
miles?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let's
assume
for
a
moment
that
he
was
going
there
to
listen
to
some
lectures
on
the
very
subject
he
was
teaching,
would
that
be
an
excuse
for
being
absent
from
his
duty
post
as
you
put
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
shafer,
if
you
have
you
got
the
views
or
someone
has,
i
thought
the
issue
you
were
presenting
in
this
case
was
the
right
of
some
kind
of
a
hearing
when
a
man's
one
year
contract
is
not
renewed,
some
kind
of
a
hearing
to
establish
evidence,
why
it
isn't
renewed,
now
that's
quite
different
from
the
terms
of
discharge
and
termination
and
so
forth,
that
we
have
been
loosely
using.
i
thought
you
had
said
at
one
point
when
you
started,
there
is
no
discharge
involved
here,
there
is
no
termination
involved
here,
it's
merely
a
failure
to
renew,
to
extend,
to
make
a
new
contract.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can't
you
let
us
in
to
that
something
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thanks
mr.
shafer,
mr.
gottesman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
mr.
gottesman,
taking
the
phrase
you
used,
is
there
anything
but
a
probationary
employee
in
a
non-tenured
context,
do
you
have
such
thing,
probationary
employees?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
a
one
year,
on
a
one
year
plan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
impact
is
that
concession
suggested
for
us?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
you
do
that
mr.
gottesman,
let
me
ask
you
this.
we
both
agree,
i
am
sure
that
writing
articles
or
making
speeches
are
first
amendment
rights.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
when
he
applies
a
send
back
letter
to
him,
so
there
is
no
dispute.
say
we
are
impressed
considerably
with
your
academic
credentials,
but
on
the
information
we
have
you
make
too
many
speeches
and
write
too
many
articles
and
for
that
reason
we
do
not
want
to
employ
you.
do
you
think
he
has
got
a
right
hearing
on
that
issue?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
alright,
you
are
talking
about
a
case
where
he
is
fired
to
use
your
word
or
--

e.

you
mr.
gottesman,

you
