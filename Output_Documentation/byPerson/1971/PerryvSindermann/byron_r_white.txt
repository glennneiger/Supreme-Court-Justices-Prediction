justice
byron
r.
white
well
let's
assume
that
there
were
valid
grounds
for
non-renewal
revealed
in
the
pleading,
that
doesn’t
necessarily
mean
that
those
are
the
grounds
the
college
used,
it
could
be
that
they
used
an
invalid
ground.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
objecting
to
--
i
gather
you
are
objecting
to
the
suggestion
that
a
person
be
giving
the
right
to
prove
a
discharge
for
an
invalid
reason.
let's
assume
this
compliant
in
this
case
did
not
in
any
way
reveal
what
could
be
called
a
justifiable
reason
for
discharge,
all
it
did,
was
say,
i
made
some
speeches
and
i
was
fired
for
making
those
speeches.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
he
pleads
right,
it's
either
the
court
or
somebody
else
who's
going
to
have
to
entertain
that
claim.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
do
concede
then
that
if
he
pleads
only
and
that
what
we
call
an
invalid
ground
or
disputed
ground,
he
should
have
a
hearing
in
the
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
do
you
think
the
fifth
circuit
meant
when
it
said
except
in
cases
where
the
teacher
or
the
institution
refuses
to
follow
these
procedures,
a
court
and
its
jurisdiction
invoked
would
ordinarily
stay
at
hand.
arguably
the
court
meant
what
we
think
would
be
better
for
the
university
to
hold
its
own
hearing,
but
if
it
refuses
to
do
so,
we
will
hold
him
here
in
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
conceded
that
at
least,
they
will
have
to
hold
in
court
on
the
right
kind
of
pleading.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
how
did
you
get
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
is
mr.
sindermann
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
working
for
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
state
senator.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
this
theory
also
apply
to
one
employed
as
a
teacher
by
private
college?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
think
you
would
be
arguing
that,
the
district
court
would
have
to
say
that
your
client
may
not
be
terminated
if
it
was
been
a
university
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
--
justice
byron
r.
white
without
regard
of
what
the
facts
would
show,
even
though
the
university
could
show
that
he
was
not
fired.
that's
the
first
amendment
right.
