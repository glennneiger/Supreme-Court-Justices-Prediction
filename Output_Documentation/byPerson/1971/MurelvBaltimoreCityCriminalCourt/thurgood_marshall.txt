if
you

would
you?
justice

marshall
if
you
put
a
little
patuxent
in
the
middle
of
the
jail
while
the
man
is
serving
his
time
and
they
say,
“we
think
you
better
be

would

my
question,
if
you
have
a
place
where
they
want
to
find
out
that
the
man’s
insane,
would
you
object
to
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
then
you
don’t
have
objection
to
their
reasonable
commitment
to
patuxent?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
to
object
what
happens
to
a
man
to
get
[voice

justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
is
transferred
from
one
place
of
business
to
another
place
of
business.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
that’s
what
i’m
saying.
i
think
1402
find
out
isn’t
really
a
real
problem
is
after
he
gets
to
patuxent.
justice
thurgood
marshall
1411.
justice
thurgood
marshall
unless
you
cant
find
out
what
happens
after
he
gets
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
have
a
counsel
before
or
at
the
examination
or
before?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
question
was
at
the
examination.
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
anything
he
says
available
to
be
used
against
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
or
not,
yes
or
no?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
doesn’t
have
counsel?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
had
no
way
of
preventing
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
have
one
of
the
person
in
this
list
says
he
should
go
to
patuxent
for
examination,
he
cant
question
that
at
all.
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
i
understand
your
requirements
or
due
process
is
if
some
officials
says
he
should
go
to
patuxent,
period.
justice
thurgood
marshall
under
this
procedure,
can
anybody
in
the
penitentiary
sign
a
piece
of
paper
and
send
that
man
to
patuxent,
period?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
what
in
the
statute
reprimands
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
that
could
be
the
third
water
boy
in
the
department
of
correctional.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
does
the
court
do?
does
it
hold
a
hearing?
the
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
his
lawyer
go
along
with
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
his
lawyer
go
with
him
when
there
will
be
an
examine
by
these
doctors?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
lawyer
present
when
report
is
prepared?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
does
the
lawyer
get
it
cracked?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
question
–
that
is
the
point
with
the
counsel,
5854
counsel
cannot
do
anything.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
know
dr.
3517
very
well
but
since
you
give
me
that
report,
can
i
read
some
of
the
reasons
3522
i’m
reading
about
patuxent?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i’m
not
–
my
only
problem
with
it
is
constitutional
3538.
justice
thurgood
marshall
next
point
is,
is
it
true
that
he
can
be
held
that
longer
than
his
original
sentence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
which
has
not
appeal
except
by
consent?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
has
not
appeared
with
the
matter
of
rights.
justice
thurgood
marshall
wouldn’t
you
agree
that
the
man
is
sentenced
unconstituted
for
one
day
that’s
bad?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
what
is
the
standard
approved?
its
3653
isn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
lord,
is
it
still
true
that
they
need
one
of
the
two
doctors
has
to
be
a
psychiatrist?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now
that?s
a
different.
oh!
go
ahead,
i?m
sorry.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
as
i
understand
the
old
maryland
law,
two
obstetricians
could
put
you
in
the
institute
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
[laughter]
while
the
other
thing,
patuxent
is
limited,
doesn?t
--
patuxent
takes
several
commitments
at
a
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
civil
commitments
would
be
the
one
at
the
civil
institutions?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
in
this
record
that
shows
that
patuxent
is
worse
than
state
penitentiaries?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
wasn?t
my
question.
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
question
was,
are
the
facilities
at
patuxent
worse
than
the
facilities
at
the
penitentiary?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what?s
your
complaint?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
case
i?m
talking
about
is
where
a
man
is
in
for
20
years.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
at
the
end
of
his
second
year,
he
goes
to
patuxent,
what?s
your
complaint?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
treatment
did
he
receive
at
the
penitentiary?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
he?s
got
it
--
well,
if
a
man?s
in
for
life,
you
make
any
complaint?
justice
thurgood
marshall
at
what
stage?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
at
ten
years,
does
he
have
a
complaint?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
can
be
determined
that
he
should
be
released?
justice
thurgood
marshall

have
relied
on
that
report.
i?m
just
trying

to
my
question.
justice

stage,
what
is

complaint?
justice
thurgood

well,
what?s
his
complaint?
justice
thurgood

complaint
is
that
he
might
be
kept

than
40
years.
justice
thurgood

i?m
asking,
what
is
the
complaint
in

justice
thurgood

justice
