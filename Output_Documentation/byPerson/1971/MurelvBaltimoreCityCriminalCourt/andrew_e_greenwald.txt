mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
thank
you
sir.
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
three
factors
that
i
would
like
to
very
briefly
mention
to
the
court.
in
a
case
called
anderson
versus
solomon,
which
was
reported
at
315
federal
supplement
1192,
a
three-judge
panel
of
the
district
court
declared
that
as
written,
the
maryland
civil
commitment
statute
was
unconstitutional,
that
is
why
it
is
being
revised
at
the
present
time.
point
number
two,
judge
sobeloff
in
the
fourth
circuit
was
very
much
bothered
by
the
question
of
reasonable
doubt
in
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
and
he
stated
in
his
concurring
and
dissenting
opinion,
?i
cannot
agree
that
the
constitution
tolerates
an
indeterminate
confinement
at
patuxent
on
no
higher
level
of
proof
that
applied
in
a
civil
proceeding
for
money
damages?
and
that?s
critical
and
was
critical
to
judge
sobeloff
in
his
dissenting
and
concurring
opinion.
what
we?re
trying
to
say
in
this
case,
what
we?re
trying
to
say
and
bring
to
the
attention
of
this
court
is,
not
that
the
patuxent
institution
as
formulated
in
the
theory
of
penal
reform
is
bad,
because
it?s
not.
no
one
is
arguing
and
disputing
the
question
that
we
need
to
do
something
about
our
prisons,
and
we
need
to
do
something
about
rehabilitation.
we
all
agree
with
that.
what
we
are
saying
is,
that
in
this
statute
as
forward
and
as
in
the
future
as
it
may
be,
it
has
problems,
and
those
problems
can?t
be
ignored
in
a
run
to
try
to
correct
the
system.
we
must
look
at
the
flaws
and
we
must
say,
?these
things
can
be
corrected.?
we
can't
sacrifice
a
great
experiment
and
sacrifice
human
lives
as
well.
that?s
not
the
real
question,
and
that?s
why
we
have
raised
these
points
and
we
consider
them
to
be
critical,
number
one,
the
statute,
is
it
civil
or
criminal?
a
man
maybe
the
subject
of
involuntary
confinement
indeterminately.
does
he
have
a
right
when
he
faces
that
prospect?
we
believe,
most
definitely,
he
does.
a
case
that
we
have
reviewed
recently
that
is
not
in
our
belief,
which
we
would
like
to
call
to
the
court?s
attention,
is
heryford
versus
parker,
reported
at
396
f
2d,
at
page
393.
the
court
in
that
case
said
it
much
better
than
i?m
able
to
say
it,
and
i?m
quoting
?it
matters
not
whether
the
proceedings
are
labeled
civil
or
criminal,
or
the
subject
matter
be
mental
instability
or
juvenile
delinquency,
it
is
the
likelihood
of
involuntary
incarceration,
whether
for
punishment,
rehabilitation
or
for
treatment,?
that?s
what?s
important.
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
i?m
sorry,
sir?
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
the
tenth
circuit,
your
honor.
what
we?re
saying
is,
we
agree
that
there
is
a
group
of
criminals
or
those
who
have
engaged
in
criminal
activity,
who
need
certain
forms
of
treatment
and
we?re
saying
that
it
is
of
good
idea,
and
it
is
a
forward
idea
to
give
treatment
to
these
people,
but
we
are
saying
that
when
you
take
a
man
out
of
group
a
from
the
criminal
population,
and
you
put
him
in
group
b,
you?ve
got
to
have
a
rational
basis
for
doing
it.
there?s
got
to
be
a
reason
for
segregating
him
and
treating
him
different,
and
that
reason
could
be
treatment
and
that
is
a
good
reason,
if
in
fact,
there
was
treatment.
the
attorney
general
tells
you
that
practically
speaking,
--
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
yes
sir,
there
is
the
testimony
of
commissioner
peppersack
which
is
found
in
the
maryland
court
of
appeals,
volume
1
at
page
520,
where
he
states
that
only
one
out
of
every
four
come
back
to
the
penitentiary.
the
records
from
the
hodge
report
which
--
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
i?m
sorry.
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
no
sir,
the
facilities
themselves
are
not
worse,
and
they
are
not
the
problem.
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
the
problem
sir
is
--
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
yes
sir.
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
the
complaint
is
sir,
that
he
would
be
eligible
for
parole
in
a
certain
period
of
time
in
the
20
year
sentence.
if
he
goes
to
patuxent
because
it
has
been
determined
that
he
has
a
particular
mental
problem
which
needs
to
be
corrected,
then
the
problem
is
that
that
problem
should
be
seen
to.
the
record
indicates
for
example,
on
page
volume
1
of
the
maryland
report
at
page
553
that
inmate
elwood
towers
was
in
patuxent
for
nine
years
and
received
no
treatment.
in
the
same
volume
at
page
589
--
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
he
didn?t
receive
any
at
the
penitentiary
sir,
but
what
we?re
saying
is
that
if
you?re
changing
him
from
20
years
to
indeterminate,
there?s
got
to
be
a
reason.
he?s
got
to
have
something
different.
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
he?s
still
eligible
for
parole
sir.
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
i
believe
in
maryland,
it?s
after
12.5
years.
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
i
think
he
has
a
complaint
any
time
hope
is
gone,
and
he
is
cast
aside
into
this
type
of
a
situation
for
an
indeterminate
period
of
time,
i
think
he
has
a
complaint.
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
but
he
has
nothing
sir,
at
this
point.
he
has
nothing
to
strive
for,
in
a
sense.
mr.
--
the
state
has
pointed
out
to
the
hodge
report,
which
on
its
face
appears
to
be
somewhat
significant.
however,
in
answering
this
question
mr.
chief
--mr.
justice
marshall,
i
would
like
to
call
the
court?s
attention
to
appendix
1a
of
the
reply
brief.
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
yes
sir.
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
my
complaint
is
that
he
now
has
a
sentence
which
was
fixed,
he
is
now
indeterminate,
and
he
is
getting
nothing
different
from
in
the
penit
--
from
when
he
was
in
the
penitentiary
now
that?s
he?s
at
patuxent.
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
his
complaint
is
that
in
the
penitentiary
--
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
yes
sir,
that?s
right.
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
i?m
sorry
i
didn?t
hear
--
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
that
he
may
be
kept
there
for
a
longer
period
of
time?
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
yes
sir.
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
sir,
there
have
been
cases
and
i
don?t
have
them
right
at
my
command
at
this
moment
that
are
in
our
brief,
where
at
the
re-determination
hearing
the
evidence
that
was
necessary
for
the
state
to
prevail
is
the
same
that
was
at
his
original
hearing.
what
we?re
saying
is
that
the
man
who
doesn?t
even
examine
this
petitioner,
or
this
suspected
defective
delinquent,
reads
to
the
court
the
staff
report.
the
state
rests
in
many
cases,
and
the
burden
then
shifts
to
the
defendant
to
cross
examine
what?
to
present
what?
to
question
who?
those
are
part
of
the
problems
that
he
--
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
i?m
sorry?
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
as
a
technical
matter,
he
possibly
could
subpoena
everyone
from
the
institution.
as
a
practical
matter,
it
doesn?t
usually
work
that
way,
sir.
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
the
statute
permits
it
sir,
but
in
many
cases
it
doesn?t
work
out
that
way
due
to
the
shortages
of
staffs
at
patuxent,
due
to
the
administrative
conflict.
may
i
in
closing
--
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
yes
sir,
but
he?d
has
no
help,
and
no
counsel,
and
no
rights
until
the
determination
is
made
that
he
is
a
defective
delinquent
by
the
staff
at
patuxent.
and
at
that
point
when
the
hearing
is
set,
that
all
of
his
rights
come
into
play
that
are
--
were
--
we?ve
been
discussing,
and
that
is
not
we
contend,
the
proper
time
for
this
man
to
be
aware.
may
i
conclude
--
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
no
sir,
i?m
not
contending
that
a
dangerous
man
in
any
respect
should
be
freed.
i?m
only
saying
that
this
is
a
different
situation.
may
i
close
with
one
sentence
from
the
reply
brief,
sir?
in
the
report
that
refutes
the
hodge
report
that
the
state
is
mentioned,
dr.
stone
of
the
american
psychiatric
association
and
professor
at
harvard
university
has
this
to
say
--
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
the
appendix
a
sir,
on
page
3a.
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
dr.
stone.
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
yes
sir.
he
said,
?until
we
can
demonstrate
that
treatment
for
defective
delinquent
in
fact
exists,
and
that
the
capacity
to
predict
dangerousness
exists
as
well,
we
cannot
encourage
government
to
create
more
patuxents.?
questions
were
--
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
it
is
sir,
because
he
also
went
over
the
statistics
or
purported
statistics
used
by
dr.
hodge.
yesterday
questions
were
asked
regarding
the
federal
statute
if
the
court
desires
mr.
feissner
has
those
answers,
if
the
court
pleases,
thank
you.
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
thank
you
sir.
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
three
factors
that
i
would
like
to
very
briefly
mention
to
the
court.
in
a
case
called
anderson
versus
solomon,
which
was
reported
at
315
federal
supplement
1192,
a
three-judge
panel
of
the
district
court
declared
that
as
written,
the
maryland
civil
commitment
statute
was
unconstitutional,
that
is
why
it
is
being
revised
at
the
present
time.
point
number
two,
judge
sobeloff
in
the
fourth
circuit
was
very
much
bothered
by
the
question
of
reasonable
doubt
in
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
and
he
stated
in
his
concurring
and
dissenting
opinion,
?i
cannot
agree
that
the
constitution
tolerates
an
indeterminate
confinement
at
patuxent
on
no
higher
level
of
proof
that
applied
in
a
civil
proceeding
for
money
damages?
and
that?s
critical
and
was
critical
to
judge
sobeloff
in
his
dissenting
and
concurring
opinion.
what
we?re
trying
to
say
in
this
case,
what
we?re
trying
to
say
and
bring
to
the
attention
of
this
court
is,
not
that
the
patuxent
institution
as
formulated
in
the
theory
of
penal
reform
is
bad,
because
it?s
not.
no
one
is
arguing
and
disputing
the
question
that
we
need
to
do
something
about
our
prisons,
and
we
need
to
do
something
about
rehabilitation.
we
all
agree
with
that.
what
we
are
saying
is,
that
in
this
statute
as
forward
and
as
in
the
future
as
it
may
be,
it
has
problems,
and
those
problems
can?t
be
ignored
in
a
run
to
try
to
correct
the
system.
we
must
look
at
the
flaws
and
we
must
say,
?these
things
can
be
corrected.?
we
can't
sacrifice
a
great
experiment
and
sacrifice
human
lives
as
well.
that?s
not
the
real
question,
and
that?s
why
we
have
raised
these
points
and
we
consider
them
to
be
critical,
number
one,
the
statute,
is
it
civil
or
criminal?
a
man
maybe
the
subject
of
involuntary
confinement
indeterminately.
does
he
have
a
right
when
he
faces
that
prospect?
we
believe,
most
definitely,
he
does.
a
case
that
we
have
reviewed
recently
that
is
not
in
our
belief,
which
we
would
like
to
call
to
the
court?s
attention,
is
heryford
versus
parker,
reported
at
396
f
2d,
at
page
393.
the
court
in
that
case
said
it
much
better
than
i?m
able
to
say
it,
and
i?m
quoting
?it
matters
not
whether
the
proceedings
are
labeled
civil
or
criminal,
or
the
subject
matter
be
mental
instability
or
juvenile
delinquency,
it
is
the
likelihood
of
involuntary
incarceration,
whether
for
punishment,
rehabilitation
or
for
treatment,?
that?s
what?s
important.
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
i?m
sorry,
sir?
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
the
tenth
circuit,
your
honor.
what
we?re
saying
is,
we
agree
that
there
is
a
group
of
criminals
or
those
who
have
engaged
in
criminal
activity,
who
need
certain
forms
of
treatment
and
we?re
saying
that
it
is
of
good
idea,
and
it
is
a
forward
idea
to
give
treatment
to
these
people,
but
we
are
saying
that
when
you
take
a
man
out
of
group
a
from
the
criminal
population,
and
you
put
him
in
group
b,
you?ve
got
to
have
a
rational
basis
for
doing
it.
there?s
got
to
be
a
reason
for
segregating
him
and
treating
him
different,
and
that
reason
could
be
treatment
and
that
is
a
good
reason,
if
in
fact,
there
was
treatment.
the
attorney
general
tells
you
that
practically
speaking,
--
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
yes
sir,
there
is
the
testimony
of
commissioner
peppersack
which
is
found
in
the
maryland
court
of
appeals,
volume
1
at
page
520,
where
he
states
that
only
one
out
of
every
four
come
back
to
the
penitentiary.
the
records
from
the
hodge
report
which
--
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
i?m
sorry.
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
no
sir,
the
facilities
themselves
are
not
worse,
and
they
are
not
the
problem.
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
the
problem
sir
is
--
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
yes
sir.
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
the
complaint
is
sir,
that
he
would
be
eligible
for
parole
in
a
certain
period
of
time
in
the
20
year
sentence.
if
he
goes
to
patuxent
because
it
has
been
determined
that
he
has
a
particular
mental
problem
which
needs
to
be
corrected,
then
the
problem
is
that
that
problem
should
be
seen
to.
the
record
indicates
for
example,
on
page
volume
1
of
the
maryland
report
at
page
553
that
inmate
elwood
towers
was
in
patuxent
for
nine
years
and
received
no
treatment.
in
the
same
volume
at
page
589
--
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
he
didn?t
receive
any
at
the
penitentiary
sir,
but
what
we?re
saying
is
that
if
you?re
changing
him
from
20
years
to
indeterminate,
there?s
got
to
be
a
reason.
he?s
got
to
have
something
different.
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
he?s
still
eligible
for
parole
sir.
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
i
believe
in
maryland,
it?s
after
12.5
years.
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
i
think
he
has
a
complaint
any
time
hope
is
gone,
and
he
is
cast
aside
into
this
type
of
a
situation
for
an
indeterminate
period
of
time,
i
think
he
has
a
complaint.
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
but
he
has
nothing
sir,
at
this
point.
he
has
nothing
to
strive
for,
in
a
sense.
mr.
--
the
state
has
pointed
out
to
the
hodge
report,
which
on
its
face
appears
to
be
somewhat
significant.
however,
in
answering
this
question
mr.
chief
--mr.
justice
marshall,
i
would
like
to
call
the
court?s
attention
to
appendix
1a
of
the
reply
brief.
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
yes
sir.
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
my
complaint
is
that
he
now
has
a
sentence
which
was
fixed,
he
is
now
indeterminate,
and
he
is
getting
nothing
different
from
in
the
penit
--
from
when
he
was
in
the
penitentiary
now
that?s
he?s
at
patuxent.
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
his
complaint
is
that
in
the
penitentiary
--
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
yes
sir,
that?s
right.
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
i?m
sorry
i
didn?t
hear
--
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
that
he
may
be
kept
there
for
a
longer
period
of
time?
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
yes
sir.
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
sir,
there
have
been
cases
and
i
don?t
have
them
right
at
my
command
at
this
moment
that
are
in
our
brief,
where
at
the
re-determination
hearing
the
evidence
that
was
necessary
for
the
state
to
prevail
is
the
same
that
was
at
his
original
hearing.
what
we?re
saying
is
that
the
man
who
doesn?t
even
examine
this
petitioner,
or
this
suspected
defective
delinquent,
reads
to
the
court
the
staff
report.
the
state
rests
in
many
cases,
and
the
burden
then
shifts
to
the
defendant
to
cross
examine
what?
to
present
what?
to
question
who?
those
are
part
of
the
problems
that
he
--
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
i?m
sorry?
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
as
a
technical
matter,
he
possibly
could
subpoena
everyone
from
the
institution.
as
a
practical
matter,
it
doesn?t
usually
work
that
way,
sir.
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
the
statute
permits
it
sir,
but
in
many
cases
it
doesn?t
work
out
that
way
due
to
the
shortages
of
staffs
at
patuxent,
due
to
the
administrative
conflict.
may
i
in
closing
--
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
yes
sir,
but
he?d
has
no
help,
and
no
counsel,
and
no
rights
until
the
determination
is
made
that
he
is
a
defective
delinquent
by
the
staff
at
patuxent.
and
at
that
point
when
the
hearing
is
set,
that
all
of
his
rights
come
into
play
that
are
--
were
--
we?ve
been
discussing,
and
that
is
not
we
contend,
the
proper
time
for
this
man
to
be
aware.
may
i
conclude
--
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
no
sir,
i?m
not
contending
that
a
dangerous
man
in
any
respect
should
be
freed.
i?m
only
saying
that
this
is
a
different
situation.
may
i
close
with
one
sentence
from
the
reply
brief,
sir?
in
the
report
that
refutes
the
hodge
report
that
the
state
is
mentioned,
dr.
stone
of
the
american
psychiatric
association
and
professor
at
harvard
university
has
this
to
say
--
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
the
appendix
a
sir,
on
page
3a.
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
dr.
stone.
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
yes
sir.
he
said,
?until
we
can
demonstrate
that
treatment
for
defective
delinquent
in
fact
exists,
and
that
the
capacity
to
predict
dangerousness
exists
as
well,
we
cannot
encourage
government
to
create
more
patuxents.?
questions
were
--
mr.
andrew
e.
greenwald
it
is
sir,
because
he
also
went
over
the
statistics
or
purported
statistics
used
by
dr.
hodge.
yesterday
questions
were
asked
regarding
the
federal
statute
if
the
court
desires
mr.
feissner
has
those
answers,
if
the
court
pleases,
thank
you.
