mr.
henry
r.
lord
that?s
correct.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that?s
been
--
that?s
an
outright
release
incidentally
on
a
re-determination
hearing.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that?s
correct.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
correct.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
yes.
as
i
recall
it
in
avey
and
creswell?s
case,
there
has
been
a
judicial
determination
of
defective
delinquency.
in
the
case
of
hayes,
i
don?t
believe
there
has.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
has
not
--
not
expired
as
of
yet.
does
that
answer
your
question?
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that?s
correct.
that?s
spelled
out
in
the
statute
sir.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
there?s
a
civil
commitment
procedure
in
article
59
of
the
maryland
code
which
is
on
the
certificate
of
two
doctors
that
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
considerably
less.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
in
civil
commitment,
the
provision
is
only
that
two
doctors
are
satisfied
that
the
person
in
question
has
a
mental
disorder
and
that
treatment
is
necessary
to
cure
this
disorder.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that?s
correct.
there
is
no
hearing
at
the
time
of
commitment.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
no.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
well
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
i
would
doubt
that
he
--
that
they
have
a
right
to
habeas
corpus
in
the
view
of
the
fact
that
it?s
purely
civil
in
nature,
but
he
can
of
course
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
apply
for
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
yes.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that?s
true.
i
might
say
that
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
well,
that?s
statute
is
being
reconsidered
and
worked
on
by
a
commission
now
and
i
would
hope
that
perhaps
even
at
this
session
in
the
general
assembly
that
considerable
number
of
due
process
protections
will
be
added
to
that
civil
commitment
statute.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
almost
two
veterinarians
unfortunately.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
no,
absolutely
not.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
when
you
say
civil,
you
mean
purely
civil?
mr.
henry
r.
lord
no,
it
only
takes
commitments
arising
after
a
criminal
conviction.
at
the
adjournment
yesterday
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
he
may
be
referred
to
patuxent
on
a
judge?s
order.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
absolutely.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
correct,
and
then
he
may
--
there
may
be
a
recommendation
from
the
correction
department
to
the
court
that
he
be
transfered.
the
court
will
then
decide
whether
he
should
be
transferred.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
it?s
more
of
a
protection.
the
hearing
under
the
federal
statute
and
incidentally
two
questions
were
raised
by
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
by
yourself
on
this
point.
the
statute
is
18
u.s.c.
section
4241
and
that
provides
for
no
hearing
at
the
time
of
transfer.
the
only
time
the
hearing
arises
is
at
the
time
of
the
expiration
of
the
sentence,
to
determine
whether
he
can
be
held
past
his
sentence.
there
is
then
a
provision
in
the
federal
statute
for
a
court
trial.
now,
at
the
adjournment
yesterday,
i?ve
made
the
point
that
the
statistics
analyzed
down
straight,
the
system
at
patuxent
works,
that
there
is
an
identifiable
group
that
can
be
recognized
by
medical
examination.
one
of
the
reasons
for
this
is
the
size
of
the
staff
at
patuxent.
they?re
budgeted
for
10
psychiatrists,
and
11
psychologists,
and
a
total
professional
staff
of
nearly
75
people,
including
social
workers,
medical
doctors,
vocational-educational
instructors,
and
this
is
bear
in
mind
for
a
population
of
patients
there,
of
only
492.
so
the
ratio
is
very
high.
at
patuxent,
annually
the
state
of
maryland
spends
almost
exactly
twice
as
much
per
patient
at
patuxent
that
it
spends
per
inmate
at
the
rest
of
the
penitentiary
system
or
prison
system,
the
figures
being
$7,994.00
per
patient
at
patuxent,
and
$4043.00
for
the
general
inmate
population
of
the
prisons.
now,
a
question
i
think
in
the
back
of
the
minds
of
some
of
the
members
of
the
court
was
that
this
is
maybe
an
almost
automatic
process
for
the
determination.
it?s
absolutely
not
the
case.
the
figures
in
the
record
will
indicate
that
only
66%
of
those
people
sent
to
patuxent
for
evaluation
are
determined
by
the
staff
at
patuxent
to
be
defective
delinquents.
and
then
when
that
66%
returns
to
court,
in
a
court
trial,
those
statistics
indicate
that
87%
are
found
to
be
defective
delinquents,
and
in
the
jury
trial
80%.
so,
you
have
an
effective
rate
of
about
50%
of
the
people
who
are
actually
referred
for
determination
actually
being
committed
to
patuxent.
so,
the
other
50%
would
be
returned
to
the
normal
prison
population,
and
would
be
found
not
to
be
qualified.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
no,
i
don?t
have
any.
there
isn?t
a
case
as
i?m
sure
you
know
that
set
down
for
argument
in
about
a
month
that
will
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
--
deal
with
that
question.
no,
it?s
not.
that
case
is
still
at
the
trial
level.
it?s
going
up
through
the
state
appeal
process.
this
is
the
case
called
mcneil
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
--
which
is
coming
here.
i
don?t
--
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
agree
with
mr.
feissner
that
there
are
such
people,
but
then
again
under
the
federal
statute,
there
certainly
are
such
people
also.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
well,
i
suppose
it?s
relevant
in
this
case.
it's
certainly
an
issue
in
this
case.
the
state
takes
a
position
that
your
opinion
in
the
winship
case
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
it
should
be
extended
to
a
proceeding
of
this
type.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
judge
sobeloff
concurred
in
part
and
dissented
in
part,
and
i
think
he
--
no,
he
did
not
on
this
point.
he
agreed
that
the
preponderance
test
was
correct,
because
it
was
basically
a
fact
finding
process,
the
state
of
a
man?s
mind
that?s
almost
impossible
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
if
i
could
just
finish
with
one
quote,
the
hodge's
report
ends
with
this
statement.
?if
the
statute
is
again
upheld,
and
since
the
effectiveness
of
the
law
is
now
been
demonstrated,
i
predict
that
most
states
will
enact
the
similar
statute
within
the
next
5
to
8
years.
i
further
predict
that
20
years
hence,
psychiatric
historians
will
regard
this
statute
as
one
of
the
major
accomplishments
in
the
middle
third
of
the
20th
century.?
mr.
henry
r.
lord
i
would
say
that
virtually
all
of
them
could
because
the
test
is
much
more
flexible
for
civil
commitment.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that?s
right,
and
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
well,
he
has
to
demonstrate
a
persistent
and
aggravated,
and
social
or
criminal
behavior.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
yes.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
yes,
he
does.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
yes,
and
of
course
the
criminal
conviction
is
a
prerequisite
threshold
point.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
i?m
not
absolutely
positive,
but
as
i
recall
it,
it?s
only
a
requirement
that
to
be
found
a
mental
disorder
and
that
treatment
is
necessary
for
that
disorder.
my
recollection
is,
in
article
59,
there?s
no
requirement
of
dangerousness.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
no,
i
do
not,
but
there
is
not
a
hearing
procedure
under
the
civil
commitment,
so
that?s
unlikely
there
would
be
such
a
case.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
absolutely
not.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
the
point
he
went
off
on
was
part
of
the
self-incrimination
point.
he
felt
that
possibly
under
some
circumstances
there
could
be
a
self-incrimination
as
i
recall.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
of
course
the
state?s
answer
to
that,
is
that
that
record
is
fully
available
to
the
petitioner
and
his
counsel
way
in
advance
of
hearing,
and
if
he
sees
things
in
there
that
he
would
like
to
rebut,
he
can
--
he
has
a
full
right
to
subpoena
any
witness
into
court.
so,
there
need
not
be
hearsay
if
the
petitioner
would
like
to
bring
that
person
into
court.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
i
believe
so,
yes
sir
it
is.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
in
order
to
determine
the
state
of
the
mind
of
the
defendant.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
thank
you.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that?s
correct.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that?s
been
--
that?s
an
outright
release
incidentally
on
a
re-determination
hearing.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that?s
correct.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
correct.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
yes.
as
i
recall
it
in

there
has

a

only
a
requirement
that
to
be
found
a
mental
disorder
and
that
treatment
is
necessary
for
that
disorder.
my
recollection
is,
in
article
59,
there?s
no
requirement
of
dangerousness.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
no,
i
do
not,
but
there
is
not
a
hearing
procedure
under
the
civil
commitment,
so
that?s
unlikely
there
would
be
such
a
case.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
absolutely
not.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
the
point
he
went
off
on
was
part
of
the
self-incrimination
point.
he
felt
that
possibly
under
some
circumstances
there
could
be
a
self-incrimination
as
i
recall.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
of
course
the
state?s
answer
to
that,
is
that
that
record
is
fully
available
to
the
petitioner
and
his
counsel
way
in
advance
of
hearing,
and
if
he
sees
things
in
there
that
he
would
like
to
rebut,
he
can
--
he
has
a
full
right
to
subpoena
any
witness
into
court.
so,
there
need
not
be
hearsay
if
the
petitioner
would
like
to
bring
that
person
into
court.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
i
believe
so,
yes
sir
it
is.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
in
order
to
determine
the
state
of
the
mind
of
the
defendant.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
thank
you.
