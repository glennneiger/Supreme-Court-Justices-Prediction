difficult
enough
for
me
to
follow
the
maryland’s
statute
without
trying
also
to
read
the
california
one
but
how
does
this
actually
work
in
fact?
this
is
only
after
somebody
is
convicted.
unknown
speaker
and
it
cannot
be
done
after
he’s
been
released
from
confinement
after
a
conviction.
is
this
normally
done
at
the
request
of
the
warden
of
the
prison?
unknown
speaker
the
court
on
its
own
motion.
unknown
speaker
and
where
does
that
appear
on
this
statutory
brief?
unknown
speaker
7
a.
unknown
speaker
mr.
karl
g.
feissner,
i
think
under
the
maryland
procedure
that
if
you're
client
warded
patuxent
during
this
period,
he
would
be
imprisoned.
unknown
speaker
but
that
doesn’t
become
an
indeterminant
sense
before
the
determination
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
no
referral,
i
was
taking
about
the
referral
period
of
time.
unknown
speaker
have
any
of
them
been
in
fact
held
beyond
the
expiration
of
their
criminal
sentence?
unknown
speaker
without
any
determination
ever
having
been
made?
unknown
speaker
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
i
go
back,
i’m
mildly
surprised
you
haven’t
drawn
some
parallel
to
the
federal
system,
after
all,
we
deal
with
that
day
by
day.
and
perhaps
after
the
argument,
you
could
submit
something.
in
a
way,
some
of
your
argument
seem
to
me
to
be
antagonistic
to
the
federal
system
also
which
i
think
has
been
upheld.
unknown
speaker
and
i
appreciate
whatever
help
you
can
give
us
on
that.
unknown
speaker
this
particular
incident
didn’t
happen
in
any
of
your
client?
unknown
speaker
mr.
daniels
is
one
of
your
client
here?
unknown
speaker
2708
there
had
to
be
an
order
of
the
judge
to
send
him
to
patuxent.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
that
doesn’t
–
no
one
can
order
anybody
to
go
to
patuxent
except
the
judge?
unknown
speaker
i
know
but
he
doesn’t
go
to
patuxent
without
a
court
order.
unknown
speaker
and
the
court
doesn’t
need
to
sign
the
order
just
because
somebody
requested?
unknown
speaker
yes
sir.
unknown
speaker
2755
the
lawyer
until
after
he
ahs
gone
to
patuxent
–
does
he
know
about
what’s
going
on
before
the
judge?
unknown
speaker
does
he
give
him
a
copy
of
what’s
written
against
him?
unknown
speaker
you
believe?
unknown
speaker
it
was
not
required.
unknown
speaker
it
is
required?
unknown
speaker
and
then
he
goes
to
patuxent?
unknown
speaker
even
the
first
referral
cannot
take
place
general
law
can
it
until
after
conviction
and
sentence?
unknown
speaker
and
must
of
be
a
prison
sentence.
it
has
to
be
a
crime
punishable
by
imprisonment
in
the
penitentiary
but
what
if
the
sentence
is
not
a
prison
sentence?
what
if
it
is
a
suspended
sentence?
unknown
speaker
it
must
be
sentence
to
at
least
serve
that?
unknown
speaker
well
the
fourth
circuit
made
that
comment.
it
has
append
there
has
to
be
an
active
prison
sentence.
unknown
speaker
thanks
a
lot.
unknown
speaker
is
that
after
the
judicial
hearing
following
the
report?
unknown
speaker
3800
unknown
speaker
and
over
a

of
how
many
years?
