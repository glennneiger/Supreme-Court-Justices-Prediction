mr.
lord,
i
am
still
a
little
bit
confused
about
the
status
of
the
particular
petitioners
before
this
court.
as
i
understand
it,
at
least
from
your
brief,
murel
has
been
released,
has
he
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
hayes
was
sentenced
to
eight
years
imprisonment
in
1965.
he
has
been
referred
to
patuxent,
but
there
has
been
no
adjudication
in
his
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
creswell,
there
has
been
an
order
committing
him
to
patuxent?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
avey,
there
was
an
order
of
committing
him
to
patuxent?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
his
prison
term
would
not
have
expired?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
greenwald,
do
you
think
it?s
likely
that
if
the
facts
exist
that
justify
a
commitment
to
patuxent
as
provided
in
the
statute
that
the
parole
board
would
parole
the
man?
