e.

thank
you.
chief

what
page
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
okay,
0605.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that’s
simply
or
not
simply
an
administrative
problem
of
the
staff
shortage
and
facilities
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
your
review,
how
does
this
process
of
getting
in
after
conviction
compared
in
the
due
process
since
with
or
in
any
other
sense
with
the
reference
before
trial,
the
person
to
determine
his
condition
either
for
purposes
of
trial
of
his
general
mental
condition?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes
but
supposed
it
does
not
and
the
prosecutor
requests,
that
often
happens
doe
sit
not?
that
an
examination
is
ordered
at
the
request
of
the
prosecution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i’m
speaking
of
the
pretrial
period.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
after
the
arraignment
if
agreed
by
the
federal
court
for
example,
prosecutor
comes
to
the
court
and
says
he
would
like
to
have
this
defendant
examine
to
determine
his
condition.
the
competency
is
done
trial
or
possibly
anticipating
a
surprise
defense
of
the
claim
of
lack
of
responsibility.
now,
do
you
see
a
difference
–
what
differences
would
you
point
out
between
the
two
processes
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you
are
suggesting
on
that
particular
case
is
that
that
is
the
only
reason
he
was
sent
there
in
the
first
place?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
he
wasn’t
sent
there
because
he
had
a
speech
impediment
was
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
focused
on
what
is
the
significance
of
not
having
a
speech
teacher.
that
suppose
he
had
allergies,
fevers
or
something
at
that
kind,
they
might
not
have
any
cure
for
that
but
how
would
that
be
relevant
to
this
problem?
chief

chief

not
necessarily
for
all
the

ailments
he
may
have.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
burch.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
focusing
at
page
20
on
number
11,
he
is
entitled
to
counsel
of
his
choice,
in
what
stage
does
he
got
that.
before
he
goes
to
patuxent?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
is
this
in
the
criminal
proceeding
of
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
familiar
with
the
federal
system
of
assignments,
statutes,
governing
matters?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
in
the
federal
system
as
of
now,
may
an
assignment
be
made
from
a
conventional
penal
institution
to
springfield
or
to
st.
elizabeth’s
hospital
if
some
mental
operation
seems
to
show
up
after
the
man
is
assigned
to
a
penal
institute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
hearing
in
that
process
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
an
administrative
or
a
judicial
hearing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
judicial
hearing.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
this
respect
would
you
say
that
there
are
more
or
less
safeguards
than
were
provided
by
the
minnesota
statute
court
was
concerned
with?
chief

chief

what
are
the
numbers
involved?
chief

we
will
continue

--
in
murel
against
the
baltimore
city
court.
mr.
lord
you
have
eight
minutes
remaining.
i
presume
you?re
saving
for
a
rebuttal
and
there
is
eight
minutes
remaining
for
mr.

for
rebuttal.
you
have
eight
minutes
of
your
argument
in
chief
left,
mr.
lord,
excuse
me.
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
he
--
would
you
say
that?s
more
protection
or
less
protection
than
the
federal
statute
gives
in
transfers
from
ordinary
penal
institution
to
springfield
or
saint
elizabeth?s?
chief
justice
warren
e.

that?s
not
true
in
the
civil
commitment,
is
it?
there?s
no
finding
of
dangerousness?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
i
recall
judge
sobeloff?s
very
narrow
dissent,
he
took
the
position
that
an
adversary
proceeding
was
not
what
he
was
advocating?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
he
was
somewhat
concerned
about
the
hearsay
aspects
of
reliance
by
the
psychiatrists
and
other
experts
on
what
was
told
then
by
the
patient,
and
by
staff
reports?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
trial
of
a
criminal
case,
determining
guilt
or
innocence
when
there
is
a
claim
of
absence
of
criminal
responsibility,
hearsay
of
that
kind
is
admissible
as
it
comes
through
the
psychiatrist,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
is
not
admissible
to
prove
the
truth
of
the
statement,
but
to
prove
that
this
is
the
information
on
which
the
psychiatrist
relies.
chief

warren
e.

very
well.
chief

warren
e.

mr.

mr.

chief

he?s
can
draw

can't
he?
chief

warren
e.

he
could
call

the

he
could
call
in
the
psychiatrists,
and
cross-examine
them?
chief

warren
e.

well,
the
statute
commits
it,
how
do
you
suggest
that
it
can?t
be
done?
chief

now,
from
the
doctor
there,
is
expressing
a
belief
