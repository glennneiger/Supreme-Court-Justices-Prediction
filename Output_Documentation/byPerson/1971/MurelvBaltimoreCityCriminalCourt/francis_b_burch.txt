mr.
francis
b.
burch
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court.
several
points
were
raised
by
mr.
justice
stewart,
before
i
get
into
my
argument
i
would
like
to
quickly
respond
to
those.
if
the
members
of
the
court
will
take
a
look
at
page
19
of
the
blue
respondents
brief,
there
is
a
list
in
pages
19
and
20
of
the
procedural
safeguards
that
surround
a
convicted
person
before
he
maybe
adjudicated
as
a
defective
delinquent.
this
are
summed
14
in
number
and
are
i
think
the
court
will
agree
elaborate,
i
think
it
was
judge
bell
of
the
fourth
circuit.
in
the
first
2350
case
in
1964
who
said
that
this
trial
and
hearing
procedures
plays
around
the
accused
more
procedural
safeguards
than
any
of
the
active
or
similar
nature
which
have
been
upheld
by
the
court
against
an
attack
of
this
sort.
the
fourth
circuit
went
on
to
say
in
that
case
in
an
unanimous
opinion
that
the
draftsman
of
the
statute
were
obviously
careful
to
conform
to
the
definition
approved
by
this
court
in
minnesota
ex
rel
pearson
v.
probate
court.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
your
honor,
what
happens
is
[voice
overlap].
mr.
francis
b.
burch
no,
there
of
course
will
have
to
be
and
this
is
a
counter
i
think
to
the
statement
–
our
indication
for
mr.
feissner,
there
must
be
a
conviction
of
one
of
the
categories
of
crime
enumerated
in
the
statute
before
a
person
maybe
sent
to
patuxent.
it’s
not
just
any
social
activity,
whatever
that
might
be
in
the
broad
sense.
it
must
be
a
conviction
also.
now,
when
he
goes
to
patuxent
for
determination,
and
this
is
the
second
point
of
mr.
justice
stewart
raised
and
i’ll
touch
on
this
in
the
answer
to
your
question.
there
must
be
a
report
made
on
whether
or
not
he’s
a
defective
delinquent
within
six
months
of
the
time
he
is
sent
to
patuxent.
he
then
must
have
a
hearing
within
three
months
after
the
determination
is
made.
and
it
is
at
that
hearing
which
is
a
civil
in
nature
hearing
on
whether
or
not
in
fact,
this
particular
individual
is
a
defective
delinquent
that
he
is
entitled
to
counsel.
he
of
course
is
entitle
to
counsel
in
this
criminal
trial
and
throughout
that.
but
this
is
a
proceeding
that
does
not
commence
until
after
there
has
been
a
criminal
conviction
and
a
sentence.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
he
ahs
counsel
at
his
trial
for
the
criminal
offense.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
at
the
examination
he
does
not,
the
examination
is
[voice

mr.
francis
b.
burch
well,
the
states
position
[voice

mr.
francis
b.
burch
yes
it
is.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
he
does
not
have
counsel
at
patuxent.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
missed
your
question.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
he
is
sent
–
if
he
meets
the
requirements
which
we
believe
meet
the
requirements
of
dues
process,
if
he
meets
those,
he
must
then
be
transferred
to
patuxent
for
evaluation.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
well,
as
a
practical
matter
and
i
think
the
record
will
bare
this
out.
in
the
overwhelming
majority
of
cases,
this
happens
immediately
after
the
court
has
sentenced
the
man
after
conviction.
he
then
recommends
[voice

mr.
francis
b.
burch
no,
absolutely
not.
mr.
francis
b.

it
says
that
the
department
of
correctional
may
but
that
would
be
a
[voice

mr.
francis
b.
burch
that’s
right,
but
i
mean,
the
initiation.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
no,
the
point
made
is
this,
there
are
five
categories
of
people
who
can
initiate
a
request
to
send
a
person
to
patuxent.
he
then
is
transferred
by
a
court
order
to
patuxent.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
that’s
right.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
oh,
absolutely
not.
the
point
i’m
making
is
that
it
must
comply
with
the
statute.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
yes
sir.
at
the
first
stage?
mr.
francis
b.
burch
no,
it
does
not.
he
examines
the
request
for
transfer
to
see
that
it
confirms
with
the
statute.
and
then
if
it
does,
he
will
sign
an
order
transferring
[voice

mr.
francis
b.
burch
does
he,
yes.
he
is
brought
before
the
judge.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
believe
it’s
in
his
record,
yes
sir.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
yes
sir.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
it
is.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
yes.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
correct.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
no.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
no.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
absolutely
not.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
when
the
report
is
returned
to
the
court
in
the
nature
of
a
presentenced
report.
once
returned
to
the
court,
the
court
must
hold
a
hearing
immediately.
and
that
point,
he
appoints
counsel.
there’s
been
no
determination
made
until
there's
a
jury
trial
or
a
court
trial
at
the
election
of
the
petitioner.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
counsel
cannot
involve
himself
in
the
proceedings
at
patuxent
until
the
matter
is
returned
to
court
and
it
must
be
returned
to
court
within
six
months
of
the
time
of
his
transfer.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i’m
generally
familiar
on
it.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
believe
so
your
honor.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
yes,
there's
a
hearing
as
to
whether
or
not
he
should
be
permanently
sent
there.
it’s
the
justice
in
nature
of
the
hearing
in
this
case.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
judicial
hearing.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
but
the
point
is
the
hearing
stage
and
this
is
the
point
i
think
that
the
state
presses
is
before
there
is
any
permanent
commitment
to
patuxent
institution,
there
is
a
hearing
in
court
at
which,
the
petitioner
has
a
right
to
summon
witnesses.
he
has
the
availability
of
the
file
from
patuxent.
he
has
the
right
to
counsel.
he
has
the
right
to
jury
trial.
he
has
the
right
to
cross
examine
and
it
is
only
then
after
the
court
with
the
jury
at
his
selection
has
made
a
determination
that
he
is
in
fact
a
defective
delinquent,
with
those
due
process
protections
that
he
is
sent
and
committed
to
patuxent
institution.
which
is
the
point
that
i
think
was
overlooked
in
the
statements
made
by
mr.
feissner.
now,
[voice
overlap].
mr.
francis
b.
burch
that’s
correct.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
yes,
he
must
be
serving
an
actual
sentence.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
yes
correct.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
that’s
right
and
i
think
when
reading
the
definition
of
defective
delinquent,
the
court
should
also
read
along
with
it.
the
threshold
crimes
which
can
trigger
a
certification
to
patuxent
or
an
order
transferring
to
patuxent.
and
that’s
again
why
i
believe
that
the
statement
that
a
simple
undifferentiated
antisocial
behavior
can
somehow
end
you
up
in
patuxent.
that’s
simply
not
true.
there
must
be
a
conviction
of
a
certain
category
of
crimes,
a
sense
and
then
a
court
order.
and
then
subsequent
proceedings.
now,
patuxent
[voice
overlap].
mr.
francis
b.
burch
your
honor,
i
firmly
believe
there
are
more
safeguards
and
that
has
been
the
finding
of
the
court
of
appeals
at
maryland’s
highest
court
and
the
finding
on
two
occasions
of
the
fourth
circuit
unanimously.
now,
the
point
that
i’ll
be
coming
to
shortly
is
other
aspects
not
just
the
hearing
on
defective
delinquency.
that’s
only
part
of
the
arguments
that
are
being
raised
by
petitioners.
there
are
also
arguments
similar
to
the
questions
in
forthcoming
for
mr.
justice
marshall
that
the
nature
of
the
examination
at
patuxent
institution.
now
i
would
like
to
quickly
give
the
court
a
thumbnail
sketch
of
the
background
of
the
institution.
the
statute
incidentally
was
drafted
by
the
1950
and
51
by
the
professor
of
constitutional
law
at
the
university
of
maryland
law
school.
and
as
the
fourth
circuit
has
indicated
in
strict
conformity
with
the
minnesota
ex
rel
pearson
v.
probate
court.
and
this
is
a
statement
from
a
group
of
six
psychiatrists
who
were
with
this
statute
in
the
preparation
stage
in
the
late
1940s.
and
i
think
its
essential
to
understand
what
maryland
is
trying
to
do
with
patuxent
to
get
a
grasp
of
what
these
psychiatrists
are
concerned
with.
this
is
in
research
report
29,
which
is
in
the
record
on
this
case
dated
1950.
the
problem
is
more
important
and
more
difficult
with
those
criminals
who
have
deficient
emotional
balance
and
control
or
the
so-called
psychopaths.
these
are
not
merely
the
habitual
offenders
but
the
offenders
who
on
the
basis
of
their
seriously
distorted
emotional
makeup
persist
in
carrying
out
serious
depredations
against
society.
examination
and
observation
by
a
competent
and
experienced
psychiatrist
together
with
recently
devised
projective
psychological
tests
is
able
to
separate
these
offenders
from
the
rest
of
the
criminal
group.
however,
recommendation
in
nearly
every
instance
will
have
to
be
based
impartibly
on
antecedent
behavior.
then
it
goes
on
to
say,
“when
maryland
has
an
institution
of
the
proposed
type,
many
of
the
most
serious
crimes
can
be
prevented.
had
eugene
james
been
observed
in
such
a
diagnostic
clinic
ten
years
before
the
murder
of
marcia
brill
when
he
was
found
guilty
of
two
unmotivated
stabbings
of
white
women
on
the
streets
of
baltimore,
that
little
girl
would
still
be
alive.
herman
ducor
would
never
have
had
an
opportunity
of
callously
murdering
a
milkman.
duffy
salinger
who
was
recently
tried
in
our
criminal
courts
for
a
series
of
armed
robberies
would
not
have
been
at
large
in
the
community
had
we
had
such
a
facility
in
1947.”
mr.
francis
b.
burch
1950.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
right,
in
’55,
it
opened
your
honor.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
and
in
closing
they
say,
“in
many
ways,
the
maryland
plan
for
handling
this
complicated
problem
is
the
best
that
is
yet
been
projected.
if
put
into
affect,
it
will
bring
the
state
into
the
forefront
of
penological
advance,
with
the
possibility
of
calling
on
john
hopkins’s
university
and
the
university
of
maryland
for
cooperation.
there
is
a
real
opportunity
for
scientific
knowledge
to
be
advanced
in
a
field
comparable
to
the
scourge
of
cancer.
so
far
as
its
affective
on
the
welfare
of
society.”
now
one
of
the
signers
of
that
report
was
dr.
3512
who
many
of
you
may
have
heard
off.
he
was
[voice

mr.
francis
b.
burch
yes
indeed.
i
was
just
trying
to
show
your
honor
the
origin
and
theory
of
patuxent
when
it
began
[voice
overlap].
mr.
francis
b.
burch
right.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
that
is
true.
it’s
an
indeterminant
sentence
your
honor.
and
let
me
point
out
[voice
overlap]
mr.
francis
b.
burch
yes,
after
the
finding
of
defective
delinquency,
he
is
sentenced
to
an
indeterminant
sentence.
and
once
again,
this
is
something
that
the
enormous
record
on
this
case
will
bare
out
i
think
as
been
[voice
overlap].
mr.
francis
b.
burch
that’s
right.
its
appealable
by
request
for
leave
to
appeal
to
the
appellates
courts?
mr.
francis
b.
burch
now,
you
maybe
interested
in
knowing
that
the
min
sentence
to
people
sent
to
patuxent
is
ten
years.
and
the
meantime
served
before
parole
at
patuxent
is
five
years.
so
from
the
way
the
statute
is
administered
certainly
if
you
have
a
short
sentence,
its
unlikely
that
you
will
spend
much
longer
than
your
sentence
[voice
overlap].
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
agree
your
honor.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
that’s
correct.
at
the
hearing
on
whether
or
not
he’s
a
defective
delinquent,
the
standard
is
3658
of
the
evidence.
and
the
findings
of
this
courts
below
is
a
joint
record
from
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
overwhelmingly
support
the
fact
that
this
proceeding
is
civil
in
nature
and
a
subsequent
completely
unrelated
to
a
criminal
conviction
in
the
sentence.
now,
your
honors,
may
i
take
the
position
that
labels
are
not
that
important.
that’s
what
the
3725
case
said
and
we
agree
entirely.
in
fact,
the
fourth
circuit
made
a
statement
that
labels
are
not
particularly
helpful
and
it’s
a
futile
exercise
in
semantics
to
argue
criminal
versus
civil.
the
point
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
and
the
fourth
circuit
have
both
held
that
this
is
civil
ion
nature.
now,
certainly,
there
are
safeguards
that
have
to
be
provided
in
the
law
and
the
point
of
the
state
urges
today
is
that
these
safeguards
do
exist
sufficiently
to
protect
the
interest
of
the
petitioners
here
and
also
the
interest
of
the
state
of
maryland
in
rehabilitating
the
[voice
overlap].
mr.
francis
b.
burch
that’s
right.
that
in
fact
of
course
is
the
reverse
side
of
the
coin,
that
is
an
additional
right
in
the
civil
area
that
does
not
exist
in
the
criminal
area.
and
this
is
provided
for
if
your
honor
will
consider
the
statute,
this
discovery
rights
in
the
defective
delinquent
statute
are
provided
for
explicit,
the
right
to
interrogatories
and
depositions,
the
full
right
to
access
to
the
file
and
summons
witnesses
and
cross
examine
witnesses.
and
while
i’m
on
this
point
of
civil
versus
criminal,
i
would
like
to
elude
to
a
statement
that
was
made
in
the
conquering
opinion
by
mr.
justice
harland
in
the
3845
case
because
it
really
is
this
point
i
think
that
many
of
this
questions
that
are
before
the
court
today
can
be
decided
upon.
mr.
justice
harland
said
there
is
nor
automatic
congruent
between
the
procedural
requirements
imposed
by
due
process
and
criminal
cases.
and
those
imposed
by
a
due
process
in
juvenile
cases.
it
is
of
great
importance
in
my
view
that
procedural
strictures
not
be
constitutionally
imposed
to
jeopardize
the
essential
elements
of
the
states
purpose
in
creating
juvenile
courts.
now,
if
you
substitute
for
juvenile
court
in
that
statement,
this
whole
business
of
the
treatment
of
defective
delinquency
recognized
or
identified
with
group
of
people
in
society,
that
is
the
state’s
position
in
essence.
you
can
call
it
civil
or
you
can
call
it
criminal.
but
you
must
recognize
that
the
states
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
carrying
out
its
programs
as
mr.
justice
harland
recognized
in
his
concurrence
and
that
there
maybe
certain
constitutional
rights.
and
mr.
justice
marshall
has
eluded
to
one
or
two
of
them
that
simply
from
a
standpoint
of
medical
treatment
cannot
be
imposed
on
the
state
of
maryland
in
an
institution
of
this
type.
this
is
an
institution
which
treats
patients
that
are
committed
there.
the
population
of
the
whole
prison
system
of
maryland
is
over
5000
people
and
there
are
less
than
500
at
patuxent
to
small
single
cell
institution
where
people
are
sent
for
psychiatric
examination.
i
think
the
fourth
circuit
made
the
point
more
quotiently
than
i
can
do
it
in
my
own
language
when
it
said
that
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
anything
more
stultifying
to
a
psychiatrist
as
dependent
as
he
is
upon
the
cooperation
of
his
patient.
and
the
presence
of
a
lawyer
objecting
to
the
psychiatrist
questions
and
advising
his
client
not
to
answer
this
question
in
that.
the
injection
of
broad
legal
restraints
into
the
diagnostic
and
treatment
procedures
that
will
deny
patuxent’s
substantial
prospect
for
improvement
over
our
earlier
practices
might
well
restrain
most
other
experimentation
looking
toward
conversion
of
our
correctional
institutions
into
effective
rehabilitating
agencies.
now
i
urge
that
this
court
take
exactly
the
same
position.
when
the
court
–
the
dc
circuit
in
a
case
called
torton
4117
several
years
ago
indicated
that
perhaps
there
should
be
a
right
to
counsel
at
the
psychiatric
examination
stage.
as
far
as
i
know,
no
other
circuit
has
adopted
and
there
was
a
vigorous
descent
in
that
case.
here,
we
have
a
case
on
a
full
record
where
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
and
the
fourth
circuit
including
all
of
its
members
in
the
separate
opinion
of
mr.
justice
–
i
mean,
senior
judge
4144
came
to
conclusion
that
it
would
be
4147
disruptive
and
that
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
counsel
at
a
psychiatric
examination.
now,
a
point
that
i
want
to
make
here
because
statistics
of
this
sort
have
only
recently
been
available
since
patuxent’s
only
been
open
since
1955
is
that
this
concept
that
was
quoted
earlier
from
the
researcher
port
is
to
what
patuxent
was
trying
to
do
with
this
category
of
people
actually
works.
the
statistics
have
demonstrated
it
and
i
address
your
honor
to
the
appendix
of
the
appellates
brief
and
the
article
from
the
american
journalist
psychiatry
of
september
1971,
which
is
reprinted
therein.
page
126
i
believe
of
the
blue
brief.
dr.
emory
hodges,
a
psychiatrist
from
washington
on
his
own
conducted
an
evaluation
because
the
proposed
statute
of
this
type
has
been
discussed
in
the
state
of
commonwealth
of
virginia.
and
he
evaluated
the
patuxent
experience
based
on
its
first
11
years.
he
found
that
the
national
right
of
recidivism
for
people
convicted
of
crime
had
been
that
they
would
commit
their
next
offense
within
three
years
of
the
time
of
their
release.
and
that
65%
to
70%
of
people
so
released
would
commit
their
next
crime
within
three
years.
the
record
at
patuxent
is
that
those
released
on
parole
from
patuxent
by
the
institutional
board
of
review
is
exactly
half,
37%
rate
of
recidivism.
half
of
a
national
average.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
they're
in
the
report
your
honor.
it’s
hundreds
of
people
and
it’s
a
large
enough
sample
to
be
represented.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
this
is
the
first
11
years
of
patuxent
experience.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
and
based
–
bare
in
mind,
it
is
using
a
time
of
three
years
to
see
what
happens.
so
he
stopped
his
statistics
in
1966
and
wrote
his
report
in
’70
and
delivered
his
paper
in
1971.
this
paper
had
not
been
released
at
the
time
of
the
fourth
circuit’s
opinion
nonetheless
upholding
the
statute
but
i’m
sure
it
would’ve
been
of
interest
to
that
court.
now,
there's
another
statistics
in
the
hodges
report
that
i
think
is
terribly
important
and
that
is
this.
of
the
untreated
group,
namely
those
where
there
had
been
a
recommendation
that
they
be
committed
to
patuxent
but
a
court
of
a
jury
under
the
civil
rights
which
each
petitioner
has
found
to
the
contrary
and
did
not
send
that
particular
person
to
patuxent.
there
was
an
81%
rate
of
recidivism.
so
that
is
more
than
double
and
it
is
over
of
the
national
average
by
11%.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court.
several
points
were
raised
by
mr.
justice
stewart,
before
i
get
into
my
argument
i
would
like
to
quickly
respond
to
those.
if
the
members
of
the
court
will
take
a
look
at
page
19
of
the
blue
respondents
brief,
there
is
a
list
in
pages
19
and
20
of
the
procedural
safeguards
that
surround
a
convicted
person
before
he
maybe
adjudicated
as
a
defective
delinquent.
this
are
summed
14
in
number
and
are
i
think
the
court
will
agree
elaborate,
i
think
it
was
judge
bell
of
the
fourth
circuit.
in
the
first
2350
case
in
1964
who
said
that
this
trial
and
hearing
procedures
plays
around
the
accused
more
procedural
safeguards
than
any
of
the
active
or
similar
nature
which
have
been
upheld
by
the
court
against
an
attack
of
this
sort.
the
fourth
circuit
went
on
to
say
in
that
case
in
an
unanimous
opinion
that
the
draftsman
of
the
statute
were
obviously
careful
to
conform
to
the
definition
approved
by
this
court
in
minnesota
ex
rel
pearson
v.
probate
court.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
your
honor,
what
happens
is
[voice
overlap].
mr.
francis
b.
burch
no,
there
of
course
will
have
to
be
and
this
is
a
counter
i
think
to
the
statement
–
our
indication
for
mr.
feissner,
there
must
be
a
conviction
of
one
of
the
categories
of
crime
enumerated
in
the
statute
before
a
person
maybe
sent
to
patuxent.
it’s
not
just
any
social
activity,
whatever
that
might
be
in
the
broad
sense.
it
must
be
a
conviction
also.
now,
when
he
goes
to
patuxent
for
determination,
and
this
is
the
second
point
of
mr.
justice
stewart
raised
and
i’ll
touch
on
this
in
the
answer
to
your
question.
there
must
be
a
report
made
on
whether
or
not
he’s
a
defective
delinquent
within
six
months
of
the
time
he
is
sent
to
patuxent.
he
then
must
have
a
hearing
within
three
months
after
the
determination
is
made.
and
it
is
at
that
hearing
which
is
a
civil
in
nature
hearing
on
whether
or
not
in
fact,
this
particular
individual
is
a
defective
delinquent
that
he
is
entitled
to
counsel.
he
of
course
is
entitle
to
counsel
in
this
criminal
trial
and
throughout
that.
but
this
is
a
proceeding
that
does
not
commence
until
after
there
has
been
a
criminal
conviction
and
a
sentence.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
he
ahs
counsel
at
his
trial
for
the
criminal
offense.
mr.
francis
b.

at
the
examination
he
does
not,
the
examination
is

mr.
francis
b.

well,
the
states
position
[voice

mr.
francis
b.

yes
it
is.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
he
does
not
have
counsel
at
patuxent.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
missed
your
question.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
he
is
sent
–
if
he
meets
the
requirements
which
we
believe
meet
the
requirements
of
dues
process,
if
he
meets
those,
he
must
then
be
transferred
to
patuxent
for
evaluation.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
well,
as
a
practical
matter
and
i
think
the
record
will
bare
this
out.
in
the
overwhelming
majority
of
cases,
this
happens
immediately
after
the
court
has
sentenced
the
man
after
conviction.
he
then
recommends

mr.
francis
b.

no,
absolutely
not.
mr.

says
that

may

that
would
be
a
[voice

mr.
francis
b.
burch
that’s
right,
but
i
mean,
the
initiation.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
no,
the
point
made
is
this,
there
are
five
categories
of
people
who
can
initiate
a
request
to
send
a
person
to
patuxent.
he
then
is
transferred
by
a
court
order
to
patuxent.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
that’s
right.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
oh,
absolutely
not.
the
point
i’m
making
is
that
it
must
comply
with
the
statute.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
yes
sir.
at
the
first
stage?
mr.
francis
b.
burch
no,
it
does
not.
he
examines
the
request
for
transfer
to
see
that
it
confirms
with
the
statute.
and
then
if
it
does,
he
will
sign
an
order
transferring
[voice
overlap].
mr.
francis
b.
burch
does
he,
yes.
he
is
brought
before
the
judge.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
believe
it’s
in
his
record,
yes
sir.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
yes
sir.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
it
is.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
yes.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
correct.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
no.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
no.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
absolutely
not.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
when
the
report
is
returned
to
the
court
in
the
nature
of
a
presentenced
report.
once
returned
to
the
court,
the
court
must
hold
a
hearing
immediately.
and
that
point,
he
appoints
counsel.
there’s
been
no
determination
made
until
there's
a
jury
trial
or
a
court
trial
at
the
election
of
the
petitioner.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
counsel
cannot
involve
himself
in
the
proceedings
at
patuxent
until
the
matter
is
returned
to
court
and
it
must
be
returned
to
court
within
six
months
of
the
time
of
his
transfer.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i’m
generally
familiar
on
it.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
believe
so
your
honor.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
yes,
there's
a
hearing
as
to
whether
or
not
he
should
be
permanently
sent
there.
it’s
the
justice
in
nature
of
the
hearing
in
this
case.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
judicial
hearing.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
but
the
point
is
the
hearing
stage
and
this
is
the
point
i
think
that
the
state
presses
is
before
there
is
any
permanent
commitment
to
patuxent
institution,
there
is
a
hearing
in
court
at
which,
the
petitioner
has
a
right
to
summon
witnesses.
he
has
the
availability
of
the
file
from
patuxent.
he
has
the
right
to
counsel.
he
has
the
right
to
jury
trial.
he
has
the
right
to
cross
examine
and
it
is
only
then
after
the
court
with
the
jury
at
his
selection
has
made
a
determination
that
he
is
in
fact
a
defective
delinquent,
with
those
due
process
protections
that
he
is
sent
and
committed
to
patuxent
institution.
which
is
the
point
that
i
think
was
overlooked
in
the
statements
made
by
mr.
feissner.
now,
[voice
overlap].
mr.
francis
b.
burch
that’s
correct.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
yes,
he
must
be
serving
an
actual
sentence.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
yes
correct.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
that’s
right
and
i
think
when
reading
the
definition
of
defective
delinquent,
the
court
should
also
read
along
with
it.
the
threshold
crimes
which
can
trigger
a
certification
to
patuxent
or
an
order
transferring
to
patuxent.
and
that’s
again
why
i
believe
that
the
statement
that
a
simple
undifferentiated
antisocial
behavior
can
somehow
end
you
up
in
patuxent.
that’s
simply
not
true.
there
must
be
a
conviction
of
a
certain
category
of
crimes,
a
sense
and
then
a
court
order.
and
then
subsequent
proceedings.
now,
patuxent
[voice
overlap].
mr.
francis
b.
burch
your
honor,
i
firmly
believe
there
are
more
safeguards
and
that
has
been
the
finding
of
the
court
of
appeals
at
maryland’s
highest
court
and
the
finding
on
two
occasions
of
the
fourth
circuit
unanimously.
now,
the
point
that
i’ll
be
coming
to
shortly
is
other
aspects
not
just
the
hearing
on
defective
delinquency.
that’s
only
part
of
the
arguments
that
are
being
raised
by
petitioners.
there
are
also
arguments
similar
to
the
questions
in
forthcoming
for
mr.
justice
marshall
that
the
nature
of
the
examination
at
patuxent
institution.
now
i
would
like
to
quickly
give
the
court
a
thumbnail
sketch
of
the
background
of
the
institution.
the
statute
incidentally
was
drafted
by
the
1950
and
51
by
the
professor
of
constitutional
law
at
the
university
of
maryland
law
school.
and
as
the
fourth
circuit
has
indicated
in
strict
conformity
with
the
minnesota
ex
rel
pearson
v.
probate
court.
and
this
is
a
statement
from
a
group
of
six
psychiatrists
who
were
with
this
statute
in
the
preparation
stage
in
the
late
1940s.
and
i
think
its
essential
to
understand
what
maryland
is
trying
to
do
with
patuxent
to
get
a
grasp
of
what
these
psychiatrists
are
concerned
with.
this
is
in
research
report
29,
which
is
in
the
record
on
this
case
dated
1950.
the
problem
is
more
important
and
more
difficult
with
those
criminals
who
have
deficient
emotional
balance
and
control
or
the
so-called
psychopaths.
these
are
not
merely
the
habitual
offenders
but
the
offenders
who
on
the
basis
of
their
seriously
distorted
emotional
makeup
persist
in
carrying
out
serious
depredations
against
society.
examination
and
observation
by
a
competent
and
experienced
psychiatrist
together
with
recently
devised
projective
psychological
tests
is
able
to
separate
these
offenders
from
the
rest
of
the
criminal
group.
however,
recommendation
in
nearly
every
instance
will
have
to
be
based
impartibly
on
antecedent
behavior.
then
it
goes
on
to
say,
“when
maryland
has
an
institution
of
the
proposed
type,
many
of
the
most
serious
crimes
can
be
prevented.
had
eugene
james

observed
in
such
a
diagnostic
clinic

the
murder
of
marcia
brill
when
he
was
found
guilty
of
two
unmotivated
stabbings
of
white
women
on
the
streets
of
baltimore,
that
little
girl
would
still
be
alive.
herman

courts

large
in
the
community
had
we
had
such
a
facility
in
1947.”

1950.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
right,
in
’55,
it
opened
your
honor.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
and
in
closing
they
say,
“in
many
ways,
the
maryland
plan
for
handling
this
complicated
problem
is
the
best
that
is
yet
been
projected.
if
put
into
affect,
it
will
bring
the
state
into
the
forefront
of
penological
advance,
with
the
possibility
of
calling
on
john
hopkins’s
university
and
the
university
of
maryland
for
cooperation.
there
is
a
real
opportunity
for
scientific
knowledge
to
be
advanced
in
a
field
comparable
to
the
scourge
of

so
far
as
its
affective
on
the
welfare
of

now
one
of
the
signers
of
that
report
was
dr.

who
many
of
you
may
have
heard
off.
he
was
[voice

mr.
francis
b.

yes
indeed.
i
was
just
trying
to
show
your
honor
the
origin
and
theory
of
patuxent
when
it
began
[voice

mr.
francis
b.
burch
right.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
that
is
true.
it’s
an
indeterminant
sentence
your
honor.
and
let
me
point
out
[voice
overlap]
mr.
francis
b.
burch
yes,
after
the
finding
of
defective
delinquency,
he
is
sentenced
to
an
indeterminant
sentence.
and
once
again,
this
is
something
that
the
enormous
record
on
this
case
will
bare
out
i
think
as
been
[voice
overlap].
mr.
francis
b.
burch
that’s
right.
its
appealable
by
request
for
leave
to
appeal
to
the
appellates
courts?
mr.
francis
b.
burch
now,
you
maybe
interested
in
knowing
that
the
min
sentence
to
people
sent
to
patuxent
is
ten
years.
and
the
meantime
served
before
parole
at
patuxent
is
five
years.
so
from
the
way
the
statute
is
administered
certainly
if
you
have
a
short
sentence,
its
unlikely
that
you
will
spend
much
longer
than
your
sentence
[voice
overlap].
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
agree
your
honor.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
that’s
correct.
at
the
hearing
on
whether
or
not
he’s
a
defective
delinquent,
the
standard
is
3658
of
the
evidence.
and
the
findings
of
this
courts
below
is
a
joint
record
from
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
overwhelmingly
support
the
fact
that
this
proceeding
is
civil
in
nature
and
a
subsequent
completely
unrelated
to
a
criminal
conviction
in
the
sentence.
now,
your
honors,
may
i
take
the
position
that
labels
are
not
that
important.
that’s
what
the
3725
case
said
and
we
agree
entirely.
in
fact,
the
fourth
circuit
made
a
statement
that
labels
are
not
particularly
helpful
and
it’s
a
futile
exercise
in
semantics
to
argue
criminal
versus
civil.
the
point
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
and
the
fourth
circuit
have
both
held
that
this
is
civil
ion
nature.
now,
certainly,
there
are
safeguards
that
have
to
be
provided
in
the
law
and
the
point
of
the
state
urges
today
is
that
these
safeguards
do
exist
sufficiently
to
protect
the
interest
of
the
petitioners
here
and
also
the
interest
of
the
state
of
maryland
in
rehabilitating
the
[voice

mr.
francis
b.
burch
that’s
right.
that
in
fact
of
course
is
the
reverse
side
of
the
coin,
that
is
an
additional
right
in
the
civil
area
that
does
not
exist
in
the
criminal
area.
and
this
is
provided
for
if
your
honor
will
consider
the
statute,
this
discovery
rights
in
the
defective
delinquent
statute
are
provided
for
explicit,
the
right
to
interrogatories
and
depositions,
the
full
right
to
access
to
the
file
and
summons
witnesses
and
cross
examine
witnesses.
and
while
i’m
on
this
point
of
civil
versus
criminal,
i
would
like
to
elude
to
a
statement
that
was
made
in
the
conquering
opinion
by
mr.
justice
harland
in
the
3845
case
because
it
really
is
this
point
i
think
that
many
of
this
questions
that
are
before
the
court
today
can
be
decided
upon.
mr.
justice
harland
said
there
is
nor
automatic
congruent
between
the
procedural
requirements
imposed
by
due
process
and
criminal
cases.
and
those
imposed
by
a
due
process
in
juvenile
cases.
it
is
of
great
importance
in
my
view
that
procedural
strictures
not
be
constitutionally
imposed
to
jeopardize
the
essential
elements
of
the
states
purpose
in
creating
juvenile
courts.
now,
if
you
substitute
for
juvenile
court
in
that
statement,
this
whole
business
of
the
treatment
of
defective
delinquency
recognized
or
identified
with
group
of
people
in
society,
that
is
the
state’s
position
in
essence.
you
can
call
it
civil
or
you
can
call
it
criminal.
but
you
must
recognize
that
the
states
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
carrying
out
its
programs
as
mr.
justice
harland
recognized
in
his
concurrence
and
that
there
maybe
certain
constitutional
rights.
and
mr.
justice
marshall
has
eluded
to
one
or
two
of
them
that
simply
from
a
standpoint
of
medical
treatment
cannot
be
imposed
on
the
state
of
maryland
in
an
institution
of
this
type.
this
is
an
institution
which
treats
patients
that
are
committed
there.
the
population
of
the
whole
prison
system
of
maryland
is
over
5000
people
and
there
are
less
than
500
at
patuxent
to
small
single
cell
institution
where
people
are
sent
for
psychiatric
examination.
i
think
the
fourth
circuit
made
the
point
more
quotiently
than
i
can
do
it
in
my
own
language
when
it
said
that
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
anything
more
stultifying
to
a
psychiatrist
as
dependent
as
he
is
upon
the
cooperation
of
his
patient.
and
the
presence
of
a
lawyer
objecting
to
the
psychiatrist
questions
and
advising
his
client
not
to
answer
this
question
in
that.
the
injection
of
broad
legal
restraints
into
the
diagnostic
and
treatment
procedures
that
will
deny
patuxent’s
substantial
prospect
for
improvement
over
our
earlier
practices
might
well
restrain
most
other
experimentation
looking
toward
conversion
of
our
correctional
institutions
into
effective
rehabilitating
agencies.
now
i
urge
that
this
court
take
exactly
the
same
position.
when
the
court
–
the
dc
circuit
in
a
case
called
torton
4117
several
years
ago
indicated
that
perhaps
there
should
be
a
right
to
counsel
at
the
psychiatric
examination
stage.
as
far
as
i
know,
no
other
circuit
has
adopted
and
there
was
a
vigorous
descent
in
that
case.
here,
we
have
a
case
on
a
full
record
where
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
and
the
fourth
circuit
including
all
of
its
members
in
the
separate
opinion
of
mr.
justice
–
i
mean,
senior
judge
4144
came
to
conclusion
that
it
would
be
4147
disruptive
and
that
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
counsel
at
a
psychiatric
examination.
now,
a
point
that
i
want
to
make
here
because
statistics
of
this
sort
have
only
recently
been
available
since
patuxent’s
only
been
open
since
1955
is
that
this
concept
that
was
quoted
earlier
from
the
researcher
port
is
to
what
patuxent
was
trying
to
do
with
this
category
of
people
actually
works.
the
statistics
have
demonstrated
it
and
i
address
your
honor
to
the
appendix
of
the
appellates
brief
and
the
article
from
the
american
journalist
psychiatry
of
september
1971,
which
is
reprinted
therein.
page
126
i
believe
of
the
blue
brief.
dr.
emory
hodges,
a
psychiatrist
from
washington
on
his
own
conducted
an
evaluation
because
the
proposed
statute
of
this
type
has
been
discussed
in
the
state
of
commonwealth
of
virginia.
and
he
evaluated
the
patuxent
experience
based
on
its
first
11
years.
he
found
that
the
national
right
of
recidivism
for
people
convicted
of
crime
had
been
that
they
would
commit
their
next
offense
within
three
years
of
the
time
of
their
release.
and
that
65%
to
70%
of
people
so
released
would
commit
their
next
crime
within
three
years.
the
record
at
patuxent
is
that
those
released
on
parole
from
patuxent
by
the
institutional
board
of
review
is
exactly
half,
37%
rate
of
recidivism.
half
of
a
national
average.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
they're
in
the
report
your
honor.
it’s
hundreds
of
people
and
it’s
a
large
enough
sample
to
be
represented.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
this
is
the
first
11
years
of
patuxent
experience.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
and
based
–
bare
in
mind,
it
is
using
a
time
of
three
years
to
see
what
happens.
so
he
stopped
his
statistics
in
1966
and
wrote
his
report
in
’70
and
delivered
his
paper
in
1971.
this
paper
had
not
been
released
at
the
time
of
the
fourth
circuit’s
opinion
nonetheless
upholding
the
statute
but
i’m
sure
it
would’ve
been
of
interest
to
that
court.
now,
there's
another
statistics
in
the
hodges
report
that
i
think
is
terribly
important
and
that
is
this.
of
the
untreated
group,
namely
those
where
there
had
been
a
recommendation
that
they
be
committed
to
patuxent
but
a
court
of
a
jury
under
the
civil
rights
which
each
petitioner
has
found
to
the
contrary
and
did
not
send
that
particular
person
to
patuxent.
there
was
an
81%
rate
of
recidivism.
so
that
is
more
than
double
and
it
is
over
of
the
national
average
by
11%.
