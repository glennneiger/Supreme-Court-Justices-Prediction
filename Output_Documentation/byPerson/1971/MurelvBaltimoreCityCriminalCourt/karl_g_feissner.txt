for

if

your
honor,
0047
era
was
committed
in
the
court
below
when
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
maryland's
defective
delinquency
law
in
its
patuxent
institution
in
meaning
and
application.
if
i
may,
i
would
first
invite
your
honor’s
attention
to
page
7
a
of
our
brief
in
the
rear,
which
sets
forth
the
definition
of
a
defective
delinquent.
as
can
be
observed,
a
defective
delinquent
or
one
who
is
claimed
to
be
a
defective
delinquent
requires
a
new
finding
of
fact
in
our
state
courts
of
four
critical
elements.
firstly,
that
the
individual
has
persistent
aggravated
anti-social
or
criminal
behavior.
secondly,
that
he
has
a
propensity
towards
this
criminal
activity.
thirdly,
that
he
is
found
to
have
intellectual
deficiency
or
emotional
imbalance.
and
fourthly,
that
he
demonstrates
and
actual
danger
to
society.
this
particular
definition
your
honors
is
triggered
by
the
provisions
of
paragraph
6-d
of
the
act
which
are
on
the
very
next
page.
a
request
for
an
examination
of
a
supposed
defective
delinquent
is
initiated
with
a
request
from
almost
any
persons
wherein
it
would
state
the
individual
suspects
or
supposes
that
the
individual
might
have
defective
delinquency.
now,
we
suggest
firstly
in
our
first
position
that
the
legislative
food
for
thought
of
supposition
or
suspected
that
someone
has
a
particular
condition
would
give
one
constitutional
indigestion.
we
bring
that
to
the
courts
attention
for
this
reason.
first
of
all,
the
lower
court
has
relied
in
our
–
nor
the
attorney
general
has
relied
on
this
courts
earlier
decision
in
minnesota
ex
rel
pearson
v.
probate
court.
we
think
that
that
reliance
is
roughly
misplaced
for
these
three
reasons.
number
one,
the
minnesota
statute
which
was
reported
to
this
court
and
the
court
only
considered
the
matter
on
the
basis
of
so
to
speak
a
demur
at
that
time.
there
was
no
procedural
hearing
such
as
we
have
in
this
case.
the
statute
in
minnesota
your
honor
has
required
three
things
before
you
could
indicate
or
begin
this
sexual
psychopath
statute
as
what
they
call
it
in
minnesota.
number
one,
that
the
facts
must
first
be
submitted
to
the
county
attorney.
secondly,
that
he
must
make
a
finding
of
good
cause.
and
thirdly,
that
he
then
prepares
a
petition
to
be
executed
by
a
person
having
knowledge
of
the
facts.
now,
your
honors,
on
the
basis
of
that
construed
and
limited
by
the
minnesota
court
held
at
minnesota
ex
rel
pearson
v.
probate
court
was
constitutional
and
we
set
that
next
to
the
maryland
defective
delinquency
act
which
merely
says
that
a
request
for
examination
maybe
filed
by
anyone
who
suspects
or
supposes.
in
this
regard,
it
is
enlightening
to
examine
very
briefly
the
attorney
general
of
california
has
seen
fit
to
file
a
brief
amicus
curiae
and
we
noted
with
interest
in
the
back
of
his
brief
in
the
appendix
section
where
he
referred
to
the
particular
california
law
and
that
law
says,
“if
it
appears
to
the
court—”
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
page
1
in
his
appendix
in
the
back.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
yes
sir.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
it
is
under
subparagraph
eight
mr.
chief
justice.
it
states
in
the
sixth
line
down,
“if
it
appears
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
court
that
there
is
probable
cause—”
and
i
think
there's
a
major
difference
sirs
between
probable
cause
and
suspecting
or
supposing.
secondly
of
note
to
turn
the
page
to
page
two
of
the
brief
of
the
attorney
general
of
california,
you
will
find
that
the
california
statute
requires
a
finding
that
the
person
could
benefit
from
treatment,
that
the
person
could
benefit
from
treatment.
the
maryland
law
which
we
think
was
designed
to
read
us
perhaps
of
the
socially
obnoxious
has
no
0445
of
treatment.
there
is
no
necessity
that
there’ll
be
treatment.
there
is
no
finding
that
their
individual
is
susceptible
of
treatments.
we
will
come
to
that
momentarily.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
yes
your
honor.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
yes
you
honor,
it
is
[voice

mr.
karl
g.
feissner
sir,
its
normally
done
–
well,
you
really
can’t
say
normal
sir
because
they
have
referrals
both
from
the
warden
of
the
prison
and
from
the
state’s
attorney
who
tried
the
case.
there
are
four
classes
of
people
that
can
refer
one
for
a
defective
delinquency
examination,
it
can
be
the
state’s
attorney
who
tried
the
case.
interestingly
enough,
the
petitioners
own
attorney,
the
petitioner
himself
or
the
warden
of
the
correctional
own
institute
where
he
finds
himself.
i
believe
there's
a
fit
one
that
has
0546
me
at
the
moment
of
the
court
on
its
own
motion.

mr.

i’m
not
competent
to
comment
on
that
sir.
i
do
not
know
the
federal
system

mr.
karl

at
last
report
your
honor,
we
understand
that
three
still
or
one
i
believe
is
on

mr.
karl
g.

they're
not
out
sir,
they
get
released
on
parole
for
extended
periods
of
time.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
haze,
knave
and
0645
are
still
among
those
present.
it’s
my
understanding
that
mr.
murel
in
between
the
fourth
circuit
and
here
has
gotten
the
cure
and
has
been
released
on
probation.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
we
raise
this
potentially
for
protection
argument
that
we
will
get
to
momentarily
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
yes
sir
we
are.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
yes
sir.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
that
is
my
second
point
sir.
he
goes
for
examination.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
yes
sir,
but
if
i
may
just
cover
that
bridge
across
that
bridge
momentarily
with
your
permission.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
the
last
pointy
i
would
invite
your
attention
to
is
the
fact
that
this
definition
of
a
defective
delinquent
is
extremely
broad
and
covers
all.
now,
under
the
maryland
law,
when
one
is
referred
to
patuxent,
he
is
referred
without
a
notice,
without
a
hearing,
without
the
benefit
of
counsel
and
believe
it
or
not,
no
right
to
appeal
the
fact
that
he
is
sent
to
patuxent
on
the
basis
of
suspicion
or
supposition.
the
maryland
law
allows
only
in
appeal
after
you
are
in
fact
determined
to
be
a
defective
delinquent.
so
we
have
then
sir
once
the
request
was
made
on
the
basis
of
suspicion
or
supposition
at
the
individual,
then
goes
to
patuxent.
he
does
have
no
notice,
no
hearing,
no
counsel.
and
after
a
period
of
nine
months
to
one
year,
the
institution
then
makes
its
return
to
the
court.
if
the
institution
finds
that
he
is
a
defective
delinquent,
then
there
is
a
hearing
in
court.
if
they
find
he
is
not
a
defective
delinquent,
there
is
no
appeal
allowed
by
public
authority
or
otherwise
and
the
individual
serves
out
his
criminal
term
or
criminal
sentence
assuming

mr.
karl
g.

he
is
on
the
receiving
0849
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
it
is
by
experience
sir
the
way
it
works.
it
just
takes
that
period
of
time.
its
an
administrative
situation.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
well,
in
this
respect,
there
is
not
sir
because
the
statute
indicates
a
period
of
90
days.
but
as
the
director
testified
at
the
court
below,
lamentably,
it
takes
nine
months
to
a
year.
he
laments
at
the
fact
that
that
is
the
case.
of
course
[voice
overlap].
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
indeed
mr.
chief
justice,
and
getting
back
to
the
court
and
getting
a
hearing
and
in
their
information
gathering
process,
it
takes
a
period
of
time.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
well,
sir,
if
an
individual
pleads
in
sanity,
he
must
submit
to
an
examination
by
the
[voice
overlap].
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
yes
sir,
that’s
correct.
well
of
course
it’s
the
burden
under
the
maryland
law
for
the
accused
and
its
also
the
burden
of
the
federal
law
for
the
accuse
to
offer
some
evidence
of
his
insanity.
and
until
he
does
offer
that
evidence,
the
state
does
not
have
any
duty
to
go
forward.
but
i
don’t
see
the
[voice
overlap].
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
yes
sir.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
i
really
don’t
see
that
materially
different
sir
except
that
it
is
a
different
standard.
one
is
mental
disease
or
defect
under
the
merit
of
law
to
relieve
someone
from
criminal
responsibility.
where
under
the
defective
delinquent
law,
its
far
broader.
in
fact,
under
the
defective
delinquent
law,
you
can
catch
anybody
in
the
net
if
you
wish
because
the
terms
are
so
vague.
for
example,
intellectual
deficiency,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
that
as
testified
on
the
court
below
means
someone
who
are
1127
did
not
endow
with
accouterments
that
perhaps
the
rest
of
us
have.
emotional
unbalance
is
a
question
of
degree
was
described.
i
think
there
is
a
more
precision
in
the
criminal
test
indeed
that
there
is
in
the
defective
delinquent
test.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
perhaps
sir,
there
are
many
men
at
patuxent
and
we
will
come
to
this
momentarily
whose
terms
have
expired
and
are
still
at
patuxent.
patuxent
is
an
indeterminant
sense.
you're
original
criminal
sentence
is
suspended.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
no
sir,
after
the
determination.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
i
beg
your
pardon,
no
sir
to
answer
your
question.
however,
there
are
individuals
at
patuxent,
i
believe
the
record
indicates
50
or
60
who
are
seen
fit
to
rely
upon
the
bill
of
rights
and
have
refused
to
discuss
their
condition
with
the
psychiatrist
and
the
state
of
maryland
in
the
case
called
1229
which
is
cited
and
well
discussed
i
believe
in
our
brief
has
held.
and
if
you
rely
upon
the
fifth
amendment,
you
will
have
to
stay
at
patuxent
until
you
do
talk
even
though
you're
criminal
sentence
has
expired.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
yes
sir,
there's
some
in
this
record
and
i
believe
you
have
insert
here
another
case
1251
where
the
same
situation,
man
is
there
11
years
on
a
5-year
sentence.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
that’s
correct
sir.
now,
if
we
can
[voice

mr.
karl
g.
feissner
i’m
sorry
sir,
i
did
not
[voice

mr.
karl
g.
feissner
well,
no
sir.
if
we
have
a
little
patuxent,
which
had
treatment
or
if
we
had
a
big
patuxent
which
had
treatment,
i
think
we’d
have
different
issues
here.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
no
sir,
i
think
that
the
state
has
the
right
to
determine
if
someone
is
insane.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
yes
sir
we
do
because
the
original
[voice

mr.
karl
g.
feissner
no
sir,
we
object
to
both.
mr.
justice
marshall,
we
object
to
the
original
part
because
they
individually
shunted
off
without
notice
of
what’s
happening,
without
a
hearing
[voice
overlap]
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
yes
sir
but
there
is
going
to
be
a
second
consequence
of
his
being
transferred.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
yes
sir,
the
fact
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
major
consequences.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
yes
sir,
for
example,
to
follow
your
point
through
sir
in
the
original
case
which
brought
this
matter
to
the
attention
of
the
courts,
we
had
a
young
man
who
received
an
18
months
sentence
and
was
there
for
seven
years.
and
eventually
was
released
because
it
was
found
[voice
overlap]
that
he
should
have
never
gone
there
in
the
first
place.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
all
right
sir,
that’s
where
we
are
coming
to
at
the
examination
stage.
as
we
have
indicated
to
you,
the
individual
goes
to
patuxent
having
been
triggered
by
a
criminal
situation
although
its
not
criminal
misbehavior
that
is
the
entrance
requirement
to
be
in
alumni
of
patuxent
institution.
he
can
have
aggravated
antisocial
behavior.
then
when
he
gets
to
patuxent
institute,
three
things
occur
which
we
find
somewhat
difficult
to
reconcile
with
constitutional
law.
number
one,
during
the
period
of
time
that
he
is
in
patuxent
and
being
examined,
he
is
not
allowed
to
have
a
benefit
of
counsel
or
benefit
of
his
own
physician.
number
two,
if
he
relies
upon
the
fifth
amendment
as
we
have
indicated,
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
in
a
case
called
1517at
183
1519
second
368
has
said
that
this
is
evidence
of
a
hostile
nature.
and
they
determined
that
because
of
his
hostility
in
citing
the
fifth
amendment
that
this
would
be
ground
for
finding
him
a
defective
delinquent.
thirdly,
under
the
1533
we
have
already
brought
into
your
attention,
if
an
individual
in
fact
takes
advantage
if
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
then
he
stays
there
until
he
does
decide
to
talk.
so
the
examination
stage
then
goes
to
where
the
prisoner
if
called
in
and
is
given
a
battery
of
psychological
and
psychiatric
test,
he
is
confronted
with
information
that
the
state
has
as
to
his
past.
unfortunately,
he
is
not
given
an
opportunity
to
refute
the
information
that
the
state
has
against
him.
for
example,
the
very
learned
and
distinguished
director
of
patuxent
in
the
maryland
cases
and
its
found
at
page
623
of
the
maryland
appendix
jamd
623
stated
that
the
individual
can
challenge
only
what
we
bring
up.
so
here,
you
have
an
individual
sir
who
is
twice
cursed.
he’s
a
criminal
and
he’s
trying
to
pay
his
debt.
secondly,
he
is
now
accused
of
one
of
two
things
either
being
a
dummy
in
a
sense
being
intellectually
deficient
or
emotionally
unbalanced,
mentally
unwell.
he’s
here
before
this
doctors,
he
has
no
counsel,
no
doctor,
no
notice,
no
hearing,
no
right
of
appeal,
no
nothing.
and
then
they
say
to
him,
“here’s
what
you
did.
we
have
all
this
background
information.
now,
you
can
comment
on
a,
b
and
c.”
he
gets
no
opportunity
sir
to
refute
what
the
institution
has.
and
this
becomes
painfully
critical
sir
for
this
reason.
you
will
find
in
the
case
that
brought
this
whole
matter
of
called
director
v.
daniels.
in
the
first
trial
of
this
young
man,
we
turn
back
in
1964,
ja4
at
page
403.
the
institution
submitted
a
report
to
the
court
and
their
procedure
at
the
patuxent
procedure
is
that
just
a
report.
it
goes
to
the
court
and
the
report
is
read
and
this
is
the
states
case.
this
of
course
is
the
reason
that
we
will
get
to
discuss
hearsay
on
a
lawyer
like
basis
with
you
in
just
a
moment.
but
the
report
goes
to
the
court
and
it
is
then
read
to
the
jury.
now
[voice

mr.
karl
g.
feissner
it
would
be
my
pleasure
to
do
that
sir.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
i
appreciate
your
asking
me
sir.
now,
as
we
indicated
to
an
individual
having
little
chance
to
refute
and
why
this
is
so
painfully
critical.
you
will
find
that
the
first
inmate
that
brought
this
case
for
the
daniels’
case,
the
inmate
in
the
report
that
was
submitted
to
the
court
is
said
that
this
15-year-old
negro
lad
attempted
to
entice
an
8-year-old
white
girl
into
sexual
activity
but
was
frightened
away
from
her
mother.
this
is
1838
to
the
trial
and
the
individual
has
no
opportunity.
the
people
who
make
this
claims
are
not
present
and
there’s
no
right
for
cross-examination.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
yes
it
did
sir,
it
said
ja4
page

[voice

mr.
karl
g.
feissner
yes
sir,
its
on
joint
appendix
4
page
403
is
where
the
report
came
in.
when
we
have
to
redetermination
hearing
allowed
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland,
we
were
able
to
summon
the
mother
in.
and
this
is
the
testimony
at
jamd
61
where
the
mother
said
this
didn’t
happen.
that
the
little
girl
was
on
her
way
to
school,
this
fellow
asked,
“do
you
want
to
play?”
she
said,
“no,
i
got
to
go
school.”
and
he
went
on
to
school
and
there
was
not
enticement
and
social
activity
and
no
effort
by
the
mother
ton
frighten
this
young
man
away.
so,
you
have
the
situation
sir
where
you
have
a
new
finding
of
fact
has
to
be
made
in
four
respects.
a
new
finding
of
fact
in
four
respects
by
a
trial
court,
a
court
which
has
before
it
a
statute
which
is
broad
enough
to
ensnare
anyone
and
then
you
have
trial
procedures
which
allow
the
most
blatant
form
of
hearsay.
the
patuxent
report,
which
is
just
read
to
the
jury
and
then
now,
it
is
up
to
the
defendant
to
overcome
it.
the
man
who
is
in
custody
having
the
least
opportunity
then
must
face
this
rambling
sea
of
four
or
five
pages
of
information
that
the
patuxent
institution
has
gotten
on
him
and
he
has
not
had
the
opportunity
to
refute
it.
he
can
only
refute
that
which
was
brought
up.
lastly,
we’d
like
to
save
this
few
minutes
but
we
would
want
to
bring
to
your
attention
the
fact
that
under
the
maryland
law,
we
think
this
is
critical
sir.
that
under
the
maryland
law,
there
is
no
requirement
that
treatment
be
given.
we
think
the
very
basis
for
such
a
law
such
as
this
is
so
called
indeterminant
confinement
to
get
the
socially
undesirable
off
the
street
should
have
a
requirement
that
the
individual
be
given
treatment
of
some
sort.
you
just
cant
house
people
out
there.
but
our
court
of
appeals
in
its
wisdom
in
several
cases
but
the
main
one
shields
v.
director
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
states
on
an
appeal
that
the
inmate
made
that
he
was
not
given
any
treatment.
the
appellates
fourth
contention
is
without
merit.
since
there
is
no
requirement
that
an
inmate
be
given
treatment
unless
the
sane
is
appropriate.
one
of
the
petitioners
in
this
case
sir
who
was
there
for
13
years
because
he
stuttered,
they
didn’t
have
a
stuttering
teacher
or
speech
teacher
for
10
years.
this
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
on
his
appeal.
it
said
page
15
of
our
reply
brief,
“as
to
the
stuttering,
there
is
no
claim
and
no
showing
that
it
could
be
helped
procured
by
treatment.
and
in
any
event,
court
of
appeals
a
claim
of
denial
of
proper
medical
treatment
has
been
held
to
be
irrelevant.”
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
oh
no

the

had

make
this

mr.

no

he

there
was
a

other

but
as
have

in
the

of

or
under
the
subject
or
trial
procedure
[voice

mr.
karl
g.
feissner
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
very
basis
upon
which
this
law
is
created
and
the
only
basis
that
this
law
could
be
sustained
is
the
fact
that
there
should
be
recognizable
medical
treatment.
in
other
words,
a
finding
that
the

mr.

defective

mr.
karl
g.
feissner
agreed.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
no
question
about
it
sir
but
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland,
our
point
is
sir
has
held
that
the
individual
cannot
bring
up
the
question
that
its
irrelevant
as
to
whether
treatment
is
available
for
his
defective
delinquency.
there
is
no
requirement
under
the
maryland
law.
it
is
our
point
sir.
no
requirement
under
the
maryland
law
that
a
committed
inmate
be
given
treatment.
we
would
like
to
save
the
rest
of
our
time
with
your
permission
sir.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
will
reserve
10
minutes
for
rebuttal
if
we
may.
your
honor,
0047
era
was
committed
in
the
court
below
when
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
maryland's
defective
delinquency
law
in
its
patuxent
institution
in
meaning
and
application.
if
i
may,
i
would
first
invite
your
honor’s
attention
to
page
7
a
of
our
brief
in
the
rear,
which
sets
forth
the
definition
of
a
defective
delinquent.
as
can
be
observed,
a
defective
delinquent
or
one
who
is
claimed
to
be
a
defective
delinquent
requires
a
new
finding
of
fact
in
our
state
courts
of
four
critical
elements.
firstly,
that
the
individual
has
persistent
aggravated
anti-social
or
criminal
behavior.
secondly,
that
he
has
a
propensity
towards
this
criminal
activity.
thirdly,
that
he
is
found
to
have
intellectual
deficiency
or
emotional
imbalance.
and
fourthly,
that
he
demonstrates
and
actual
danger
to
society.
this
particular
definition
your
honors
is
triggered
by
the
provisions
of
paragraph
6-d
of
the
act
which
are
on
the
very
next
page.
a
request
for
an
examination
of
a
supposed
defective
delinquent
is
initiated
with
a
request
from
almost
any
persons
wherein
it
would
state
the
individual
suspects
or
supposes
that
the
individual
might
have
defective
delinquency.
now,
we
suggest
firstly
in
our
first
position
that
the
legislative
food
for
thought
of
supposition
or
suspected
that
someone
has
a
particular
condition
would
give
one
constitutional
indigestion.
we
bring
that
to
the
courts
attention
for
this
reason.
first
of
all,
the
lower
court
has
relied
in
our
–
nor
the
attorney
general
has
relied
on
this
courts
earlier
decision
in
minnesota
ex
rel
pearson
v.
probate
court.
we
think
that
that
reliance
is
roughly
misplaced
for
these
three
reasons.
number
one,
the
minnesota
statute
which
was
reported
to
this
court
and
the
court
only
considered
the
matter
on
the
basis
of
so
to
speak
a
demur
at
that
time.
there
was
no
procedural
hearing
such
as
we
have
in
this
case.
the
statute
in
minnesota
your
honor
has
required
three
things
before
you
could
indicate
or
begin
this
sexual
psychopath
statute
as
what
they
call
it
in
minnesota.
number
one,
that
the
facts
must
first
be
submitted
to
the
county
attorney.
secondly,
that
he
must
make
a
finding
of
good
cause.
and
thirdly,
that
he
then
prepares
a
petition
to
be
executed
by
a
person
having
knowledge
of
the
facts.
now,
your
honors,
on
the
basis
of
that
construed
and
limited
by
the
minnesota
court
held
at
minnesota
ex
rel
pearson
v.
probate
court
was
constitutional
and
we
set
that
next
to
the
maryland
defective
delinquency
act
which
merely
says
that
a
request
for
examination
maybe
filed
by
anyone
who
suspects
or
supposes.
in
this
regard,
it
is
enlightening
to
examine
very
briefly
the
attorney
general
of
california
has
seen
fit
to
file
a
brief
amicus
curiae
and
we
noted
with
interest
in
the
back
of
his
brief
in
the
appendix
section
where
he
referred
to
the
particular
california
law
and
that
law
says,
“if
it
appears
to
the
court—”
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
page
1
in
his
appendix
in
the
back.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
yes
sir.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
it
is
under
subparagraph
eight
mr.
chief
justice.
it
states
in
the
sixth
line
down,
“if
it
appears
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
court
that
there
is
probable
cause—”
and
i
think
there's
a
major
difference
sirs
between
probable
cause
and
suspecting
or
supposing.
secondly
of
note
to
turn
the
page
to
page
two
of
the
brief
of
the
attorney
general
of
california,
you
will
find
that
the
california
statute
requires
a
finding
that
the
person
could
benefit
from
treatment,
that
the
person
could
benefit
from
treatment.
the
maryland
law
which
we
think
was
designed
to
read
us
perhaps
of
the
socially
obnoxious
has
no
0445
of
treatment.
there
is
no
necessity
that
there’ll
be
treatment.
there
is
no
finding
that
their
individual
is
susceptible
of
treatments.
we
will
come
to
that
momentarily.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
yes
your
honor.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
yes
you
honor,
it
is
[voice

mr.
karl
g.
feissner
sir,
its
normally
done
–
well,
you
really
can’t
say
normal
sir
because
they
have
referrals
both
from
the
warden
of
the
prison
and
from
the
state’s
attorney
who
tried
the
case.
there
are
four
classes
of
people
that
can
refer
one
for
a
defective
delinquency
examination,
it
can
be
the
state’s
attorney
who
tried
the
case.
interestingly
enough,
the
petitioners
own
attorney,
the
petitioner
himself
or
the
warden
of
the
correctional
own
institute
where
he
finds
himself.
i
believe
there's
a
fit
one
that
has

the

mr.

i’m
not

on
that
sir.
i
do
not

mr.

understand

mr.

they're
not
out

they
get

for
extended
periods
of
time.
mr.
karl
g.

haze,
knave
and
0645
are
still

those

it’s
my
understanding
that
mr.

in
between
the
fourth

and
here
has
gotten
the
cure
and
has
been
released
on
probation.
mr.
karl
g.

we
raise
this
potentially
for
protection
argument
that
we
will
get
to
momentarily
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
yes
sir
we
are.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
yes
sir.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
that
is
my
second
point
sir.
he
goes
for
examination.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
yes
sir,
but
if
i
may
just
cover
that
bridge
across
that
bridge
momentarily
with
your
permission.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
the
last
pointy
i
would
invite
your
attention
to
is
the
fact
that
this
definition
of
a
defective
delinquent
is
extremely
broad
and
covers
all.
now,
under
the
maryland
law,
when
one
is
referred
to
patuxent,
he
is
referred
without
a
notice,
without
a
hearing,
without
the
benefit
of
counsel
and
believe
it
or
not,
no
right
to
appeal
the
fact
that
he
is
sent
to
patuxent
on
the
basis
of
suspicion
or
supposition.
the
maryland
law
allows
only
in
appeal
after
you
are
in
fact
determined
to
be
a
defective
delinquent.
so
we
have
then
sir
once
the
request
was
made
on
the
basis
of
suspicion
or
supposition
at
the
individual,
then
goes
to
patuxent.
he
does
have
no
notice,
no
hearing,
no
counsel.
and
after
a
period
of
nine
months
to
one
year,
the
institution
then
makes
its
return
to
the
court.
if
the
institution
finds
that
he
is
a
defective
delinquent,
then
there
is
a
hearing
in
court.
if
they
find
he
is
not
a
defective
delinquent,
there
is
no
appeal
allowed
by
public
authority
or
otherwise
and
the
individual
serves
out
his
criminal
term
or
criminal
sentence
assuming

mr.
karl
g.

he
is
on
the
receiving
0849
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
it
is
by
experience
sir
the
way
it
works.
it
just
takes
that
period
of
time.
its
an
administrative
situation.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
well,
in
this
respect,
there
is
not
sir
because
the
statute
indicates
a
period
of
90
days.
but
as
the
director
testified
at
the
court
below,
lamentably,
it
takes
nine
months
to
a
year.
he
laments
at
the
fact
that
that
is
the
case.
of
course
[voice
overlap].
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
indeed
mr.
chief
justice,
and
getting
back
to
the
court
and
getting
a
hearing
and
in
their
information
gathering
process,
it
takes
a
period
of
time.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
well,
sir,
if
an
individual
pleads
in
sanity,
he
must
submit
to
an
examination
by
the
[voice

mr.
karl
g.
feissner
yes
sir,
that’s
correct.
well
of
course
it’s
the
burden
under
the
maryland
law
for
the
accused
and
its
also
the
burden
of
the
federal
law
for
the
accuse
to
offer
some
evidence
of
his
insanity.
and
until
he
does
offer
that
evidence,
the
state
does
not
have
any
duty
to
go
forward.
but
i
don’t
see
the
[voice
overlap].
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
yes
sir.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
i
really
don’t
see
that
materially
different
sir
except
that
it
is
a
different
standard.
one
is
mental
disease
or
defect
under
the
merit
of
law
to
relieve
someone
from
criminal
responsibility.
where
under
the
defective
delinquent
law,
its
far
broader.
in
fact,
under
the
defective
delinquent
law,
you
can
catch
anybody
in
the
net
if
you
wish
because
the
terms
are
so
vague.
for
example,
intellectual
deficiency,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
that
as
testified
on
the
court
below
means
someone
who
are
1127
did
not
endow
with
accouterments
that
perhaps
the
rest
of
us
have.
emotional
unbalance
is
a
question
of
degree
was
described.
i
think
there
is
a
more
precision
in
the
criminal
test
indeed
that
there
is
in
the
defective
delinquent
test.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
perhaps
sir,
there
are
many
men
at
patuxent
and
we
will
come
to
this
momentarily
whose
terms
have
expired
and
are
still
at
patuxent.
patuxent
is
an
indeterminant
sense.
you're
original
criminal
sentence
is
suspended.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
no
sir,
after
the
determination.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
i
beg
your
pardon,
no
sir
to
answer
your
question.
however,
there
are
individuals
at
patuxent,
i
believe
the
record
indicates
50
or
60
who
are
seen
fit
to
rely
upon
the
bill
of
rights
and
have
refused
to
discuss
their
condition
with
the
psychiatrist
and
the
state
of
maryland
in
the
case
called
1229
which
is
cited
and
well
discussed
i
believe
in
our
brief
has
held.
and
if
you
rely
upon
the
fifth
amendment,
you
will
have
to
stay
at
patuxent
until
you
do
talk
even
though
you're
criminal
sentence
has
expired.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
yes
sir,
there's
some
in
this
record
and
i
believe
you
have
insert
here
another
case
1251
where
the
same
situation,
man
is
there
11
years
on
a
5-year
sentence.

correct

well,
no
sir.
if
we
have
a
little
patuxent,
which
had
treatment
or
if
we
had
a
big
patuxent
which
had
treatment,
i
think
we’d
have
different
issues
here.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
no
sir,
i
think
that
the
state
has
the
right
to
determine
if
someone
is
insane.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
yes
sir
we
do
because
the
original
[voice

mr.
karl
g.
feissner
no
sir,
we
object
to
both.
mr.
justice
marshall,
we
object
to
the
original
part
because
they
individually
shunted
off
without
notice
of
what’s
happening,
without
a
hearing
[voice

mr.
karl
g.
feissner
yes
sir
but
there
is
going
to
be
a
second
consequence
of
his
being
transferred.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
yes
sir,
the
fact
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
major
consequences.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
yes
sir,
for
example,
to
follow
your
point
through
sir
in
the
original
case
which
brought
this
matter
to
the
attention
of
the
courts,
we
had
a
young
man
who
received
an
18
months
sentence
and
was
there
for
seven
years.
and
eventually
was
released
because
it
was
found
[voice
overlap]
that
he
should
have
never
gone
there
in
the
first
place.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
all
right
sir,
that’s
where
we
are
coming
to
at
the
examination
stage.
as
we
have
indicated
to
you,
the
individual
goes
to
patuxent
having
been
triggered
by
a
criminal
situation
although
its
not
criminal
misbehavior
that
is
the
entrance
requirement
to
be
in
alumni
of
patuxent
institution.
he
can
have
aggravated
antisocial
behavior.
then
when
he
gets
to
patuxent
institute,
three
things
occur
which
we
find
somewhat
difficult
to
reconcile
with
constitutional
law.
number
one,
during
the
period
of
time
that
he
is
in
patuxent
and
being
examined,
he
is
not
allowed
to
have
a
benefit
of
counsel
or
benefit
of
his
own
physician.
number
two,
if
he
relies
upon
the
fifth
amendment
as
we
have
indicated,
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
in
a
case
called
1517at
183
1519
second
368
has
said
that
this
is
evidence
of
a
hostile
nature.
and
they
determined
that
because
of
his
hostility
in
citing
the
fifth
amendment
that
this
would
be
ground
for
finding
him
a
defective
delinquent.
thirdly,
under
the
1533
we
have
already
brought
into
your
attention,
if
an
individual
in
fact
takes
advantage
if
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
then
he
stays
there
until
he
does
decide
to
talk.
so
the
examination
stage
then
goes
to
where
the
prisoner
if
called
in
and
is
given
a
battery
of
psychological
and
psychiatric
test,
he
is
confronted
with
information
that
the
state
has
as
to
his
past.
unfortunately,
he
is
not
given
an
opportunity
to
refute
the
information
that
the
state
has
against
him.
for
example,
the
very
learned
and
distinguished
director
of
patuxent
in
the
maryland
cases
and
its
found
at
page
623
of
the
maryland
appendix
jamd
623
stated
that
the
individual
can
challenge
only
what
we
bring
up.
so
here,
you
have
an
individual
sir
who
is
twice
cursed.
he’s
a
criminal
and
he’s
trying
to
pay
his
debt.
secondly,
he
is
now
accused
of
one
of
two
things
either
being
a
dummy
in
a
sense
being
intellectually
deficient
or
emotionally
unbalanced,
mentally
unwell.
he’s
here
before
this
doctors,
he
has
no
counsel,
no
doctor,
no
notice,
no
hearing,
no
right
of
appeal,
no
nothing.
and
then
they
say
to
him,
“here’s
what
you
did.
we
have
all
this
background
information.
now,
you
can
comment
on
a,
b
and
c.”
he
gets
no
opportunity
sir
to
refute
what
the
institution
has.
and
this
becomes
painfully
critical
sir
for
this
reason.
you
will
find
in
the
case
that
brought
this
whole
matter
of
called
director
v.
daniels.
in
the
first
trial
of
this
young
man,
we
turn
back
in
1964,
ja4
at
page
403.
the
institution
submitted
a
report
to
the
court
and
their
procedure
at
the
patuxent
procedure
is
that
just
a
report.
it
goes
to
the
court
and
the
report
is
read
and
this
is
the
states
case.
this
of
course
is
the
reason
that
we
will
get
to
discuss
hearsay
on
a
lawyer
like
basis
with
you
in
just
a
moment.
but
the
report
goes
to
the
court
and
it
is
then
read
to
the
jury.
now
[voice

mr.
karl
g.
feissner
it
would
be
my
pleasure
to
do
that
sir.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
i
appreciate
your
asking
me
sir.
now,
as
we
indicated
to
an
individual
having
little
chance
to
refute
and
why
this
is
so
painfully
critical.
you
will
find
that
the
first
inmate
that
brought
this
case
for
the
daniels’
case,
the
inmate
in
the
report
that
was
submitted
to
the
court
is
said
that
this
15-year-old
negro
lad
attempted
to
entice
an
8-year-old
white
girl
into
sexual
activity
but
was
frightened
away
from
her
mother.
this
is
1838
to
the
trial
and
the
individual
has
no
opportunity.
the
people
who
make
this
claims
are
not
present
and
there’s
no
right
for
cross-examination.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
yes
it
did
sir,
it
said
ja4
page
4
[voice
overlap].
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
yes
sir,
its
on
joint
appendix
4
page
403
is
where
the
report
came
in.
when
we
have
to
redetermination
hearing
allowed
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland,
we
were
able
to
summon
the
mother
in.
and
this
is
the
testimony
at
jamd
61
where
the
mother
said
this
didn’t
happen.
that
the
little
girl
was
on
her
way
to
school,
this
fellow
asked,
“do
you
want
to
play?”
she
said,
“no,
i
got
to
go
school.”
and
he
went
on
to
school
and
there
was
not
enticement
and
social
activity
and
no
effort
by
the
mother
ton
frighten
this
young
man
away.
so,
you
have
the
situation
sir
where
you
have
a
new
finding
of
fact
has
to
be
made
in
four
respects.
a
new
finding
of
fact
in
four
respects
by
a
trial
court,
a
court
which
has
before
it
a
statute
which
is
broad
enough
to
ensnare
anyone
and
then
you
have
trial
procedures
which
allow
the
most
blatant
form
of
hearsay.
the
patuxent
report,
which
is
just
read
to
the
jury
and
then
now,
it
is
up
to
the
defendant
to
overcome
it.
the
man
who
is
in
custody
having
the
least
opportunity
then
must
face
this
rambling
sea
of
four
or
five
pages
of
information
that
the
patuxent
institution
has
gotten
on
him
and
he
has
not
had
the
opportunity
to
refute
it.
he
can
only
refute
that
which
was
brought
up.
lastly,
we’d
like
to
save
this
few
minutes
but
we
would
want
to
bring
to
your
attention
the
fact
that
under
the
maryland
law,
we
think
this
is
critical
sir.
that
under
the
maryland
law,
there
is
no
requirement
that
treatment
be
given.
we
think
the
very
basis
for
such
a
law
such
as
this
is
so
called
indeterminant
confinement
to
get
the
socially
undesirable
off
the
street
should
have
a
requirement
that
the
individual
be
given
treatment
of
some
sort.
you
just
cant
house
people
out
there.
but
our
court
of
appeals
in
its
wisdom
in
several
cases
but
the
main
one
shields
v.
director
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
states
on
an
appeal
that
the
inmate
made
that
he
was
not
given
any
treatment.
the
appellates
fourth
contention
is
without
merit.
since
there
is
no
requirement
that
an
inmate
be
given
treatment
unless
the
sane
is
appropriate.
one
of
the
petitioners
in
this
case
sir
who
was
there
for
13
years
because
he
stuttered,
they
didn’t
have
a
stuttering
teacher
or
speech
teacher
for
10
years.
this
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
on
his
appeal.
it
said
page
15
of
our
reply
brief,
“as
to
the
stuttering,
there
is
no
claim
and
no
showing
that
it
could
be
helped
procured
by
treatment.
and
in
any
event,
court
of
appeals
a
claim
of
denial
of
proper
medical
treatment
has
been
held
to
be
irrelevant.”
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
oh
no
sir,
the
jury
had
to
make
this
other
determinations
but
when
you
[voice

mr.
karl
g.
feissner
no
sir.
he
was
sent
there
because
there
was
a
finding
of
these
other
things
but
as
have
said
forth
in
the
beginning
of
our
brief,
or
under
the
subject
or
trial
procedure
[voice
overlap].
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
very
basis
upon
which
this
law
is
created
and
the
only
basis
that
this
law
could
be
sustained
is
the
fact
that
there
should
be
recognizable
medical
treatment.
in
other
words,
a
finding
that
the
[voice

mr.
karl
g.
feissner
defective
delinquency.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
agreed.
mr.
karl
g.
feissner
no
question
about
it
sir
but
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland,
our
point
is
sir
has
held
that
the
individual
cannot
bring
up
the
question
that
its
irrelevant
as
to
whether
treatment
is
available
for
his
defective
delinquency.
there
is
no
requirement
under
the
maryland
law.
it
is
our
point
sir.
no
requirement
under
the
maryland
law
that
a
committed
inmate
be
given
treatment.
we
would
like
to
save
the
rest
of
our
time
with
your
permission
sir.
