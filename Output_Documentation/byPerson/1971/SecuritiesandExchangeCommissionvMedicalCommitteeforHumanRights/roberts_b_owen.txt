mr.
roberts
b.
owen
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
get
to
the
merits
of
the
issue
presented
for
decision
here,
as
quickly
as
i
can,
but
i
think
i
should
deal
with
one
issue
at
the
outset,
an
issue
which
was
belatedly
raised
by
the
government,
which
i
think
deserves
immediate
attention.
the
court
will
recall
that
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
the
government
affirmatively
took
the
position
that
this
case
presented
an
important
justiciable
controversy
which
deserved
resolution
here.
they
affirmatively
argued
in
those
papers
that
even
if
dow
chemical
company
should
ultimately
include
our
shareholder
proposal
in
the
proxy
materials
and
even
if
that
proposal
should
thus
reach
the
shareholders
and
be
rejected
by
those
shareholders,
nevertheless
this
case
would
not
be
moot.
and
they
affirmatively
argued,
we
think
correctly,
that
the
case
involves
a
continuing
controversy
between
the
medical
committee
and
the
sec.
in
those
certiorari
papers,
they
cited
two
decisions
of
this
court
to
the
effect
that
where
you
have
a
continuing
controversy
of
this
kind,
the
court
should
go
forward
and
decide
the
question
on
its
merits,
we
agree
that
those
cases
are
controlling
and
we
rely
upon
them.
now
against
that
background,
both
the
government’s
main
brief
on
the
merits
and
our
main
brief
on
the
merits
were
directed
exclusively
to
the
merits
of
the
controversy
and
that
is
to
the
issue
of
administrative
reviewability,
we
did
not
discuss,
we
moved
this
point,
we
did
not
have
the
opportunity
to
do
so.
but
five
days
ago,
when
the
government
filed
their
reply
brief,
they
changed
their
position
and
suggested
for
the
first
time
that
the
controversy
we
have
here
is
in
fact
an
abstract-academic
dispute.
they
suggest
that
the
action
of
the
commission
in
this
case
was
without
the
practical
consequences
which
are
necessary
to
render
the
question
justiciable
and
i
think
that
if
i
can
take
just
a
moment
to
describe
how
a
securities
and
exchange
commission
actually
handles
shareholders
disputes
of
this
kind,
i
can
show
you
that
what
we
have
here
is
a
hard,
live,
continuing
controversy
between
these
parties
so
that
a
judicial
resolution
of
the
issue
is
entirely
public.
now,
in
discussing
what
actually
happens
in
the
commission
proceedings,
i
am
going
to
be
emphasizing
substance
and
not
form.
in
a
series
of
decisions
of
this
court,
the
court
has
made
clear
that
the
appropriateness
of
judicial
review
of
administrative
action
depends
on
the
realities
of
what
the
agency
does
and
not
on
the
labels
which
the
agency
appends
to
it
and
that
is
the
spirit
in
whichalike
i
think,
this
case
has
to
be
approached.
now,
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
a
very
specific,
narrow,
factual
situation.
this
is
a
situation
where
a
shareholder
of
a
company
has
submitted
a
written
proposal
to
the
company
and
requested
the
company
to
include
the
proposal
in
its
proxy
materials
pursuant
to
sec
proxy
rule
14a-8.
that
rule
provides
that
prima
facie
every
such
proposal
must
be
included
in
the
proxy
materials
so
that
the
shareholders
can
ultimately
consider
it.
the
rule
goes
on
to
provide
certain
exceptions,
under
which
a
specific
proposal
may
be
excluded.
now,
we
are
taking
about
a
situation
here
where
the
shareholder
has
submitted
his
proposal
to
the
company
and
said,
“i
want
to
include
it
under
the
general
rule
requiring
inclusion”,
and
the
company
says
in
response,
“no,
it
falls
within
one
of
the
exception
in
the
proxy
rules
and
it
need
not
as
a
matter
of
law
be
included
in
our
proxy
materials
and
therefore
we
do
propose
to
include
it”.
now
at
that
point,
you
of
course,
have
a
concrete
dispute
between
the
shareholder
and
the
company
and
what
happens
next
is
this.
the
commission’s
rules
require
that
that
dispute
between
the
shareholder
and
the
company
be
brought
before
the
agency
for
its
review.
and
we
have
recognized
of
course
that
the
commission
did
not
have
to
promulgate
the
rule
saying
that
the
parties
must
bring
the
suit,
the
dispute
before
the
agency.
but
the
agency
has
promulgated
that
rule,
neither
the
company
nor
the
shareholder
can
avoid
having
no
dispute
brought
before
the
agency,
but
both
of
them
have
to
submit
therefore
to
agency
review
of
their
problem.
now,
specifically
the
rules
require
that
the
shareholder’s
proposal
and
supporting
papers
must
be
sent
to
the
sec
and
the
company
must
also
furnish
the
agency
with
a
statement
of
its
position
and
it
must
also
serve
those
papers
on
the
shareholders
so
the
shareholder
will
know
what
has
happened.
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
if
the
company
always
has
the
option,
mr.
justice,
of
simply
accepting
the
proposal
and
putting
it
in
their
proxy
material.
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
they
have
no
choice.
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
one
of
two
things
can
happen.
when
they
have
receive
the
shareholder
proposal,
they
make
a
legal
judgment
as
to
whether
they
must
include
that
proposal
in
the
proxy
material.alike
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
no,
if
you
please
your
honor,
what
happens
is
this.
they
take
that
shareholder
proposal,
however
absurd
or
valid
it
may
be.
they
hold
it
up
against
the
commission’s
proxy
rules
which
say
that
certain
kinds
of
proposals
must
be
included
and
certain
or
maybe
excluded.
they
make
a
legal
determination
for
themselves
whether
they
must
include
or
not
and
they
make
a
decision
that
whether
they
will
or
not
include.
now,
of
course
if
they
agree
to
include
it,
they
have
done
exactly
what
the
shareholder
wanted
and
that
is
the
end
of
the
matter,
no
dispute.
if
they
decide
to
exclude
it,
then
they
must
purport
that
decision
to
the
commission
and
that
triggers
the
administrative
process
which
i
am
about
to
describe.
let
me
make
clear
what
the
nature
of
these
disputes
is,
i
think
i
have
already
got
into
the
core
of
it.
we
have
one
factual
survey
which
has
been
made
of
what
happens
in
the
commission
when
these
disputes
are
brought
before
it
under
the
rules.
there
is
a
gentleman
named
mr.
cluther
rath(ph)
who
spent
several
years
in
the
sec’s
division
of
corporation
finance
and
he
actually
surveyed
the
papers
that
are
submitted
to
the
commission
and
he
surveyed
what
the
commission
did
those
papers
and
he
has
reported
the
facts
in
a
publication
upon
which
both
sides
rely
in
this
case.
he
makes
very
clear
from
his
survey
that
virtually
every
dispute
has
framed
between
the
shareholder
and
the
company
and
which
comes
before
the
agency
is
a
pure
dispute
of
law,
just
a
disagreement
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
proxy
rules.
the
company
is
arguing
--
the
proposal
falls
within
one
of
the
exceptions
which
allows
us
to
exclude
the
proposal
and
the
shareholder
is
saying,
“no.
we
come
within
the
general
rule
and
not
within
the
exceptions,
the
proxy
rules
require
the
inclusion
of
our
proposal.
the
court
i
hope
will
bear
in
mind
that
during
the
agency
proceeding,
under
the
agency
rules,
the
company
has
the
burden
of
persuasion
on
that
issue.
it
is
the
principle
in
the
agency
that
all
doubts
must
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
shareholder
which
is
to
say
in
favor
of
inclusion
of
the
proposal
in
the
proxy
materials.
when
the
legal
issue
has
been
posed
by
the
two
parties
to
the
dispute
before
the
agency,
it
is
first
taken
under
consideration
by
the
staff,
that
is,
the
division
of
corporation
finance.
and
what
the
division
does
is
make
a
legal
determination
whether
the
proposal
must
be
included
or
whether
it
may
be
excluded
under
one
of
the
exceptions.
in
this
case,
for
example,
the
division
of
corporation
finance,
flatly
ruled
as
a
matter
of
law
and
it
is
written
down
in
the
record,
that
dow’s
legal
position
was
correct
and
that
the
shareholder's
contentions
of
the
law
were
wrong.
the
division
then
notified
both
parties
that
they
had
decided
in
favor
of
the
company
on
the
legal
issue
and
they
went
on
to
say
in
their
letter
that,
in
view
of
that
legal
determination,
they
would
not
recommend
any
action
against
the
company
if
the
proposal
were
excluded
from
the
proxy
materials.
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
the
company
is
still
free
to
include
or
exclude.
as
a
matter
of
practice
it
always
excludes
once
it
has
been
notified
by
the
agency
that
the
agency
is
not
going
to
take
any
action.
i
will
come
back
to
that
in
a
moment
and
show
that
when
it
is
in
the
reverse
situation,
the
company
always
accepts
the
proposal
and
includes
in
its
proxy
material.
now,
following
the
staff's
determination
as
to
this
legal
issue,
the
losing
party,
may
if
he
wishes,
ask
the
four
or
five
man
commission
to
review
the
staff's
resolution
of
the
legal
issue.
and
as
a
matter
of
practice,
when
requested
to
do
so,
the
commission
does
review
the
staff’s
action.
i
might
add
incidentally
that
written
legal
argument
is
submitted
to
the
commission
by
both
sides
if
they
wanted,
that
is
what
happened
in
this
case.
dow
presented,
if
you
will,
a
brief
to
the
commission
and
said,
“we
think
we
are
right
on
the
law
and
we
can
exclude.”
the
shareholder,
respondent
with
written
legal
argument
and
said,
“we
think
dow
is
wrong
on
the
law,
we
think
they
are
required
as
a
matter
of
law
to
include
our
proposal
in
the
proxy
materials”.
so
now
i
come
to
the
vital
question
in
the
case
which
is
what
does
the
commission
actually
do
in
a
dispute
of
this
kind?
the
fact
is
that
in
practice,
the
commission
actually
decides
the
proper
legal
issue
on
its
merits,
it
takes
the
shareholder
proposal
which
is
involved.
it
holds
it
up
against
the
very
precise
legal
standards
which
are
written
out
in
the
commission’s
own
rules
and
it
decides
the
legal
status,
if
you
will,
of
that
particular
proposal.
and
if
you
look
at
page
25
of
the
government’s
main
brief
you
will
see
confirmed
the
fact
by
a
former
chairman
of
the
commission
that
they
decide
the
status
of
the
proposal
under
the
proxy
rules
and
essentially
legal
determination.
i
might
add
that
in
mr.
cluther
rath's
survey
of
this
whole
situation,
he
recites
decision
after
decision
after
decision
by
the
commission
on
the
merits
of
the
legal
issue
presented.
he
does
not
identify
a
single
case
in
which
the
commission
did
not
decide
the
legal
issue
on
its
merit.
indeed,
the
government
here
has
not
cited
a
single
situation
in
which
the
commission
did
not
decide
that
question
on
its
merits.
and
thus
far,
i
might
add,
there
have
been
five
courts
that
have
considered
such
commission
action
and
they
all
treated
it
as
a
decision
by
the
commission
on
the
merits
of
the
legal
issue
presented.
now,
in
this
case,
the
government,
if
i
may
say
so,
focuses
on
form
and
not
substance.
they
focus
on
the
language
of
the
letter
which
then
came
out
of
the
commission
after
they
had
resolved
the
issue
against
us.
now,
the
language
of
the
letter
was
that,
they
adopted
the
recommendation
of
the
division
of
corporation
finance
and
on
that
basis
would
take
no
action
against
dow.
the
emphasis
that
the
government
places
here
is
on
the
no
action
language
and
they
say
what
they
speculate,
that
possibly,
the
commission
somehow
bypassed
the
legal
issue
which
had
been
argued
to
it
by
the
parties
and
decided
to
take
no
action
against
dow
without
deciding
that
legal
issue.
but
i
should
emphasize
they
are
speculating
only
as
to
what
the
commission
may
have
done,
the
government
in
this
case
has
never
come
right
out
and
the
circuit
that
the
commission
sidestepped
the
legal
issue.
and
in
any
event,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
sidestepping
speculation,
if
you
will,
is
pretty
unrealistic.
obviously
the
commission
is
not
going
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
take
action
against
the
company
without
first
deciding
whether
the
company
is
right
on
the
law
or
wrong
on
the
law.
in
fact
as
mr.
cluther
rath's
reports
makes
clear
they
always
do
decide
the
legal
issue;
if
they
decide
the
company
is
wrong
on
the
law,
they
send
the
company
a
letter
and
say,
“we
think
you
are
wrong,
and
we
think
that
the
law,
that
is,
the
proxy
rules,
require
that
you
include
this
proposal
in
your
proxy
material”.
on
the
other
hand,
if
they
decide
the
company
is
right
on
the
law,
they
send
out
a
no-action
letter.
now,
that
is
what
actually
happens.
now,
let
me
talk
for
a
moment
about
the
practical
impact
upon
the
parties,
when
a
commission
decision
has
been
rendered.
in
a
case
where
the
commission
decides
that
the
company
is
wrong
on
the
legal
issue,
as
a
practical
matter,
the
shareholder
can
relax,
his
worries
are
over.
faced
with
that
position
by
the
commission,
the
company
knows
it
has
two
choices,
it
can
either
bow
to
the
commission's
ruling
of
the
law
and
include
the
proposal
in
its
proxy
materials
or
on
the
other
hand,
it
can
ignore
the
commission’s
ruling
but
if
does
so,
it
faces
very
severe
sanctions.
at
the
first
place
in
that
situation,
the
commission
can
institute
an
administrative
proceeding
looking
toward
de-listing
of
the
company's
securities
for
violation
of
the
proxy
rules.
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
entirely
so,
mr.
justice,
yes.
i
am
not
saying
that
anyone
of
these
sanctions
must
be
taken
by
the
commission
but
the
company
knows
they
are
at
hazard
and
they
run
this
risk.
now
one
risk
is
an
administrative
proceeding
against
them
for
de-listing
of
the
securities,
another
is
in
an
egregious
case
of
criminal
prosecution
by
the
attorney
general
at
the
request
of
the
commission
that
most
likely
as
a
practical
matter
is
a
civil
suit
by
the
commission
against
the
company
for
injunctive
relief
to
compel
the
company
to
include
the
proposal
in
the
proxy
materials.
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
indeed.
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
absolutely
correct,
mr.
justice.
in
the
entire
history
of
the
securities
act,
there
has
only
been
one
company
who
ever
declined
to
abide
by
the
commissions
ruling,
that
was
transamerican
corporation,
they
were
probably
sued
by
the
commission,
they
lost
the
case,
that
was
in
1947
more
than
20
years
ago.
no
company,
since
that
time
has
ever
defied
the
commission’s
ruling.
in
other
words,
no
shareholder
in
history
has
ever
had
to
take
any
action
to
defend
his
rights,
once
the
commission
has
ruled
in
its
favor
on
that
issue
and
i
suggest
that
is
entirely
as
it
should
be
one
of
the
principal
responsibilities
of
the
sec
is
to
serve
as
the
guardian
of
corporate
shareholders.
now,
i
have
discussed
the
shareholder
who
wins
before
the
commission
but
compare
his
situation
with
a
fellow
who
loses.
if
the
commission,
let
us
assume,
erroneously
decides
against
the
shareholder
in
this
dispute
which
they
have
brought
before
themselves,
then
of
course
that
shareholder
has
been
wrong
and
he
suffers
a
number
of
distinct
practical
ways.
in
the
first
place,
he
has
been
wrongfully
deprived
of
the
commissions
very
effective
help.
secondly,
if
he
wants
to
vindicate
his
rights,
he
must
undertake
the
expensive
litigation.
he
has
no
other
choice.
thirdly,
in
that
litigation,
wherever
it
occurs,
the
court
involved
is
likely
to
give
great
weight
perhaps
even
decisive
weight
to
the
commission’s
ruling,
adverse
ruling
on
the
question
of
law
involved.
prior
to
this
case
--
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
i
think
not,
your
honor.
and
let
me,
as
far
as
the
district
court
is
concerned,
let
me
mention
that
there
have
been,
before
this
case,
only
three
law
suits
brought
in
district
court.
in
each
case,
the
commission
had
ruled
adversely
to
the
shareholders
and
in
each
case,
the
court
said,
“ah,
you
are
faced
with
an
adverse
determination
by
the
commission,
they
are
an
expert
body,
they
have
interpreted
their
own
proxy
rules,
i
am
going
to
give
great
weight
to
that.
i
think
it
is
unlikely
that
you
are
going
to
prevail
on
the
merits
and
i
deny
you
preliminary
injunctive
relief”.
that
is
a
very
--
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
that
is
correct
and
i
suggest
mr.
justice
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
situation
where
the
agency
of
which
complaint
is
made
is
before
the
court
and
is
arguing
its
case
and
presenting
its
position.
in
a
situation
like
that,
the
court
is
entirely
confident
to
pass
on
whatever
the
legal
question
will
be
or
maybe
presented,
and
no
great
weight
then
is
going
to
be
given
to
the
administrative
interpretation
of
the
law.
but
the
situation
i
suggest
is
otherwise
where
the
commission
is
not
pressed,
you
have
district
court
litigation
between
the
shareholder
and
dow
chemical
company,
all
you
have
is
a
commission
interpretation
of
its
rules,
the
district
judge,
a
busy
man,
being
asked
to
enjoin
the
shareholder's
meeting
or
take
some
other
drastic
step.
he
cannot
ask
the
commission
for
its
views.
he
does
not
have
them
before
him
in
the
litigation.
he
simply
accepts
the
fact
that
the
commission
has
interpreted
its
rules.
it
has
interpreted
those
rules
against
the
shareholder.
he
says
the
commission’s
view
is
entitled
to
great
weight,
that
is
the
end
of
the
matter.
now
that
has
happened
in
the
only
cases
that
had
ever
come
up
in
district
court.
i
do
not
say
that
it
should
not
have
happened
that
way,
i
am
simply
saying
that
that
is
the
lesson
of
history.
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
i
think
not.
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
i
should
not.
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
that
is
correct
and
we
do
not
say
that
the
shareholder
--
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
no
quite,
mr.
justice.
our
position
is
that
what
happens
in
fact,
is
that
the
commission
decides
the
legal
issue.
now
at
that
point,
we
cannot
and
we
do
not
claim
the
right
to
require
the
commission
to
take
any
particular
action.
but
if
they
--
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
the
court
of
appeals,
mr.
justice,
remanded
to
the
commission
simply
with
the
request
that
they
clarify
their
reasoning,
that
the
court
of
appeals
looked
at
the
commission’s
reasoning
on
the
merits
and
said
in
effect,
“we
simply
do
not
understand,
how
you
have
to
come
out
that
way
and
we
would
like
you
to
clarify
your
reasoning
on
the
legal
issue”,
so
that
the
if
an
error
of
law
that
had
been
made
by
the
commission,
it
could
be
rectified
by
the
court.
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
let
me
put
it
this
way,
if
the
case
now
goes
back
as
we
think
it
should
to
the
commission,
the
commission
will
then
explain
how
it
reached
this
conclusion.
if
the
commission
says
--
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
we
could
take
it
back
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
aalike
declaration
of
what
the
law
really
says.
we
would
not
--
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
we
would
get
no
coercive
action
at
all.
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
what
this
committee
would
get
is
an
explanation
of
the
law
by
the
court
of
appeals.
that
is
a
direct
legal
principle
that
should
govern
the
commission.
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
the
good
that
it
would
do,
i
submit,
is
that
the
commission
would
obey
or
would
follow
the
principle
enunciated
by
the
court.
this
is
if
you
will
--
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
it
would
not
need
to,
but
we
are
quite
--
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
that
is
correct.
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
well,
that
in
fact
does
not
happen
and
let
me
remind
the
court,
if
i
may,
that
in
such
case
as
abbott
laboratories
against
gardner,
the
only
thing
that
was
requested
of
the
court
was
a
declaratory
judgment,
that
is
a
declaration
of
what
the
law
really
is.
and
abbott
laboratories
was
content
with
that
relief.
they
got
it
and
they
got,
it
was
a
very
practical
remedy.
let
me
remind
you
that
in
the
case
of
perkins
against
elg,
this
was
the
case
where
the
lady
had
been
denied
the
passport
and
she
suggested
that
she
had
been
denied
that
passport,
incidentally
the
issuance
of
passport
is
a
discretionary
function.
but
the
secretary
had
denied
her
the
passport
because
he
ruled
that
she
was
legally
ineligible.
what
this
court
did
was
review
that
legal
determination
and
say
if
she
is
legally
eligible,
the
secretary
can
not
deny
the
passport
on
that
ground.
he
may
be
able
to
deny
the
passport
on
some
other
ground
but
not
on
the
basis
of
a
legal
error.
it
was
a
declaration
then
of
the
correct
legal
principles,
it
was
not
a
coercive
form
of
decree.
we
did
not,
in
the
court
of
appeals
ask
for
a
coercive
form
of
decree
and
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
misunderstandings
we
have
with
the
solicitor
general.
he
suggests
that
we
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
said
and
we
want
you,
the
court
of
appeals,
to
direct
the
commission
to
start
enforcement
proceedings
against
dow.
that
is
not
we
did.
if
you
read
our
petition
--
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
well,
i
will
mr.
justice.
thank
you
for
inviting
my
attention
to
that.
first
of
all,
it
is
not
in
the
record
that
the
company
has
stopped
manufacturing
napalm,
i
gather
it
is
the
fact.
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
it
is
also
the
fact,
not
in
the
record,
that
they
immediately
announced
that
they
wanted
to
get
that
contract
back
again
and
resume
supplying
napalm
to
the
government
so
that
as
far
as
that
fact
is
concerned,
i
think
it
is
simply
besides
the
point.
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
it
was,
after
we
had
fought
for
it
two
years,
they
finally
bowed
to
the
court
of
appeal's
view
of
the
law
and
said,
“we
are
reserving
all
rights
to
exclude
that
next
time
around”,
they
made
it
very
clear
that
the
next
time
around,
they
are
reserving
the
right
to
exclude
our
proposal
on
legal
grounds.
but
this
time
they
put
it
in
the
proxy
materials.
now,
it
is
the
firm
intention
of
this
organization
to
submit
this
proposal
again.
it
has
an
affirmative
right
to
do
that
under
the
proxy
rules.
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
or
intending
to.
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
the
proposal
as
your
honor
is
aware,
submitted
by
this
shareholder
was
that
the
certificate
of
incorporation
of
the
company
be
modified,
amended
so
a
to
foreclose
it
from
manufacturing
napalm.
now,
that
is
a
continuing
problem.
the
company
has
un-publicly
announced
that
it
intends
--
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
we
are
going
to
resubmit
this
probably
let
us
say
within
20
months
after
this
court’s
decisions
in
this
case.
presumably
dow
will
exclude
it
once
more,
presumably
the
commission
will
rule
against
us
and
we
will
find
ourselves
in
exactly
this
same
controversy
again.
now,
the
government
represented
to
the
court,
this
was
an
important
issue
of
judicial
review
that
was
involved,
there
have
been
no
facts
that
have
come
in
to
existence
that
were
not
in
existence
when
the
government
submitted
the
case
to
you
and
when
they
briefed
it
to
you
and
we
rely
on
the
very
cases
that
they
have
cited
in
their
papers
to
the
effect
that
this
case
is
not
moot.
now,
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
spend
one
moment
on
the
review
statute
with
which
we
are
dealing.
that
statute
says
in
effect
that
if
we
were
a
party
to
a
proceeding
before
the
commission,
if
the
commission
took
final
action
in
our
case
and
if
were
agreed
by
that
action,
we
are
affirmatively
entitled
to
judicial
review.
i
submit
that
we
fall
squarely
within
the
language
of
that
statute.
we
were
a
party,
to
a
proceeding
before
the
commission.
the
commission
took
final
action
in
our
case,
they
had
required
us
to
appear.
we
did
not
want
to
but
they
did.
we
were
agreed
by
that
final
action
and
i
suggest
that
we
therefore
fall
squarely
within
the
terms
of
the
review
statute
that
is
presented.
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
the
suggestion
being
that
a
telephone
call
that
a
staff
member
made
to
some
representative
of
the
shareholder,
the
content
of
which
is
not
disclosed
in
this
record,
triggered
the
statutory
period
for
appeal.
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
that
is
right.
that
is
a
different
issue.
assuming
we
have
an
order,
the
first
notice
we
got
of
it
was
when
they
sent
us
a
letter,
and
except
for
the
phone
call.
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
we
did
not.
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
what
was
said
during
that
phone
call,
whether
we
got
an
accurate
description
of
the
commission’s
action
or
whether
we
did
it.
we
waited
six
days
and
we
got
a
letter
which
told
us
what
the
commission
had
done.
and
with
all
due
respect,
i
submit
that
this
court's
decision
in
schofield
against
the
nlrb
in
394
us,
makes
it
very
clear
that
the
agreed
party
in
entitled
to
receive
a
final
definite
word
as
to
what
has
happened
to
it
before
the
60-day
period
against
their
run.
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
that
would
be
correct,
if
there
is
no
order,
i
think
the
red
lion
broadcasting
case
makes
clear
there
is
an
order.
let
me
say
in
conclusion
that
we
are
hard
pressed
to
understand
why
we
should
not
be
entitled
to
the
judicial
review
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
we
did
not
voluntarily
present
our
legal
problems
to
the
commission.
the
commission
required
us
to
submit
to
its
decision
making
process.
we
follow
the
commission’s
rule,
the
agency
then
decided
that
we
were
legally
ineligible
to
enjoy
a
right
which
we
think
the
law
has
conferred
upon
us.
if
that
administrative
decision
was
wrong,
we
have
clearly
been
hurt
and
we
believe
that
courts
should
be
and
are
available
to
rectify
such
errors.
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
get
to
the
merits
of
the
issue
presented
for
decision
here,
as
quickly
as
i
can,
but
i
think
i
should
deal
with
one
issue
at
the
outset,
an
issue
which
was
belatedly
raised
by
the
government,
which
i
think
deserves
immediate
attention.
the
court
will
recall
that
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
the
government
affirmatively
took
the
position
that
this
case
presented
an
important
justiciable
controversy
which
deserved
resolution
here.
they
affirmatively
argued
in
those
papers
that
even
if
dow
chemical
company
should
ultimately
include
our
shareholder
proposal
in
the
proxy
materials
and
even
if
that
proposal
should
thus
reach
the
shareholders
and
be
rejected
by
those
shareholders,
nevertheless
this
case
would
not
be
moot.
and
they
affirmatively
argued,
we
think
correctly,
that
the
case
involves
a
continuing
controversy
between
the
medical
committee
and
the
sec.
in
those
certiorari
papers,
they
cited
two
decisions
of
this
court
to
the
effect
that
where
you
have
a
continuing
controversy
of
this
kind,
the
court
should
go
forward
and
decide
the
question
on
its
merits,
we
agree
that
those
cases
are
controlling
and
we
rely
upon
them.
now
against
that
background,
both
the
government’s
main
brief
on
the
merits
and
our
main
brief
on
the
merits
were
directed
exclusively
to
the
merits
of
the
controversy
and
that
is
to
the
issue
of
administrative
reviewability,
we
did
not
discuss,
we
moved
this
point,
we
did
not
have
the
opportunity
to
do
so.
but
five
days
ago,
when
the
government
filed
their
reply
brief,
they
changed
their
position
and
suggested
for
the
first
time
that
the
controversy
we
have
here
is
in
fact
an
abstract-academic
dispute.
they
suggest
that
the
action
of
the
commission
in
this
case
was
without
the
practical
consequences
which
are
necessary
to
render
the
question
justiciable
and
i
think
that
if
i
can
take
just
a
moment
to
describe
how
a
securities
and
exchange
commission
actually
handles
shareholders
disputes
of
this
kind,
i
can
show
you
that
what
we
have
here
is
a
hard,
live,
continuing
controversy
between
these
parties
so
that
a
judicial
resolution
of
the
issue
is
entirely
public.
now,
in
discussing
what
actually
happens
in
the
commission
proceedings,
i
am
going
to
be
emphasizing
substance
and
not
form.
in
a
series
of
decisions
of
this
court,
the
court
has
made
clear
that
the
appropriateness
of
judicial
review
of
administrative
action
depends
on
the
realities
of
what
the
agency
does
and
not
on
the
labels
which
the
agency
appends
to
it
and
that
is
the
spirit
in
whichalike
i
think,
this
case
has
to
be
approached.
now,
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
a
very
specific,
narrow,
factual
situation.
this
is
a
situation
where
a
shareholder
of
a
company
has
submitted
a
written
proposal
to
the
company
and
requested
the
company
to
include
the
proposal
in
its
proxy
materials
pursuant
to
sec
proxy
rule
14a-8.
that
rule
provides
that
prima
facie
every
such
proposal
must
be
included
in
the
proxy
materials
so
that
the
shareholders
can
ultimately
consider
it.
the
rule
goes
on
to
provide
certain
exceptions,
under
which
a
specific
proposal
may
be
excluded.
now,
we
are
taking
about
a
situation
here
where
the
shareholder
has
submitted
his
proposal
to
the
company
and
said,
“i
want
to
include
it
under
the
general
rule
requiring
inclusion”,
and
the
company
says
in
response,
“no,
it
falls
within
one
of
the
exception
in
the
proxy
rules
and
it
need
not
as
a
matter
of
law
be
included
in
our
proxy
materials
and
therefore
we
do
propose
to
include
it”.
now
at
that
point,
you
of
course,
have
a
concrete
dispute
between
the
shareholder
and
the
company
and
what
happens
next
is
this.
the
commission’s
rules
require
that
that
dispute
between
the
shareholder
and
the
company
be
brought
before
the
agency
for
its
review.
and
we
have
recognized
of
course
that
the
commission
did
not
have
to
promulgate
the
rule
saying
that
the
parties
must
bring
the
suit,
the
dispute
before
the
agency.
but
the
agency
has
promulgated
that
rule,
neither
the
company
nor
the
shareholder
can
avoid
having
no
dispute
brought
before
the
agency,
but
both
of
them
have
to
submit
therefore
to
agency
review
of
their
problem.
now,
specifically
the
rules
require
that
the
shareholder’s
proposal
and
supporting
papers
must
be
sent
to
the
sec
and
the
company
must
also
furnish
the
agency
with
a
statement
of
its
position
and
it
must
also
serve
those
papers
on
the
shareholders
so
the
shareholder
will
know
what
has
happened.
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
if
the
company
always
has
the
option,
mr.
justice,
of
simply
accepting
the
proposal
and
putting
it
in
their
proxy
material.
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
they
have
no
choice.
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
one
of
two
things
can
happen.
when
they
have
receive
the
shareholder
proposal,
they
make
a
legal
judgment
as
to
whether
they
must
include
that
proposal
in
the
proxy
material.alike
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
no,
if
you
please
your
honor,
what
happens
is
this.
they
take
that
shareholder
proposal,
however
absurd
or
valid
it
may
be.
they
hold
it
up
against
the
commission’s
proxy
rules
which
say
that
certain
kinds
of
proposals
must
be
included
and
certain
or
maybe
excluded.
they
make
a
legal
determination
for
themselves
whether
they
must
include
or
not
and
they
make
a
decision
that
whether
they
will
or
not
include.
now,
of
course
if
they
agree
to
include
it,
they
have
done
exactly
what
the
shareholder
wanted
and
that
is
the
end
of
the
matter,
no
dispute.
if
they
decide
to
exclude
it,
then
they
must
purport
that
decision
to
the
commission
and
that
triggers
the
administrative
process
which
i
am
about
to
describe.
let
me
make
clear
what
the
nature
of
these
disputes
is,
i
think
i
have
already
got
into
the
core
of
it.
we
have
one
factual
survey
which
has
been
made
of
what
happens
in
the
commission
when
these
disputes
are
brought
before
it
under
the
rules.
there
is
a
gentleman
named
mr.
cluther
rath(ph)
who
spent
several
years
in
the
sec’s
division
of
corporation
finance
and
he
actually
surveyed
the
papers
that
are
submitted
to
the
commission
and
he
surveyed
what
the
commission
did
those
papers
and
he
has
reported
the
facts
in
a
publication
upon
which
both
sides
rely
in
this
case.
he
makes
very
clear
from
his
survey
that
virtually
every
dispute
has
framed
between
the
shareholder
and
the
company
and
which
comes
before
the
agency
is
a
pure
dispute
of
law,
just
a
disagreement
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
proxy
rules.
the
company
is
arguing
--
the
proposal
falls
within
one
of
the
exceptions
which
allows
us
to
exclude
the
proposal
and
the
shareholder
is
saying,
“no.
we
come
within
the
general
rule
and
not
within
the
exceptions,
the
proxy
rules
require
the
inclusion
of
our
proposal.
the
court
i
hope
will
bear
in
mind
that
during
the
agency
proceeding,
under
the
agency
rules,
the
company
has
the
burden
of
persuasion
on
that
issue.
it
is
the
principle
in
the
agency
that
all
doubts
must
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
shareholder
which
is
to
say
in
favor
of
inclusion
of
the
proposal
in
the
proxy
materials.
when
the
legal
issue
has
been
posed
by
the
two
parties
to
the
dispute
before
the
agency,
it
is
first
taken
under
consideration
by
the
staff,
that
is,
the
division
of
corporation
finance.
and
what
the
division
does
is
make
a
legal
determination
whether
the
proposal
must
be
included
or
whether
it
may
be
excluded
under
one
of
the
exceptions.
in
this
case,
for
example,
the
division
of
corporation
finance,
flatly
ruled
as
a
matter
of
law
and
it
is
written
down
in
the
record,
that
dow’s
legal
position
was
correct
and
that
the
shareholder's
contentions
of
the
law
were
wrong.
the
division
then
notified
both
parties
that
they
had
decided
in
favor
of
the
company
on
the
legal
issue
and
they
went
on
to
say
in
their
letter
that,
in
view
of
that
legal
determination,
they
would
not
recommend
any
action
against
the
company
if
the
proposal
were
excluded
from
the
proxy
materials.
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
the
company
is
still
free
to
include
or
exclude.
as
a
matter
of
practice
it
always
excludes
once
it
has
been
notified
by
the
agency
that
the
agency
is
not
going
to
take
any
action.
i
will
come
back
to
that
in
a
moment
and
show
that
when
it
is
in
the
reverse
situation,
the
company
always
accepts
the
proposal
and
includes
in
its
proxy
material.
now,
following
the
staff's
determination
as
to
this
legal
issue,
the
losing
party,
may
if
he
wishes,
ask
the
four
or
five
man
commission
to
review
the
staff's
resolution
of
the
legal
issue.
and
as
a
matter
of
practice,
when
requested
to
do
so,
the
commission
does
review
the
staff’s
action.
i
might
add
incidentally
that
written
legal
argument
is
submitted
to
the
commission
by
both
sides
if
they
wanted,
that
is
what
happened
in
this
case.
dow
presented,
if
you
will,
a
brief
to
the
commission
and
said,
“we
think
we
are
right
on
the
law
and
we
can
exclude.”
the
shareholder,
respondent
with
written
legal
argument
and
said,
“we
think
dow
is
wrong
on
the
law,
we
think
they
are
required
as
a
matter
of
law
to
include
our
proposal
in
the
proxy
materials”.
so
now
i
come
to
the
vital
question
in
the
case
which
is
what
does
the
commission
actually
do
in
a
dispute
of
this
kind?
the
fact
is
that
in
practice,
the
commission
actually
decides
the
proper
legal
issue
on
its
merits,
it
takes
the
shareholder
proposal
which
is
involved.
it
holds
it
up
against
the
very
precise
legal
standards
which
are
written
out
in
the
commission’s
own
rules
and
it
decides
the
legal
status,
if
you
will,
of
that
particular
proposal.
and
if
you
look
at
page
25
of
the
government’s
main
brief
you
will
see
confirmed
the
fact
by
a
former
chairman
of
the
commission
that
they
decide
the
status
of
the
proposal
under
the
proxy
rules
and
essentially
legal
determination.
i
might
add
that
in
mr.
cluther
rath's
survey
of
this
whole
situation,
he
recites
decision
after
decision
after
decision
by
the
commission
on
the
merits
of
the
legal
issue
presented.
he
does
not
identify
a
single
case
in
which
the
commission
did
not
decide
the
legal
issue
on
its
merit.
indeed,
the
government
here
has
not
cited
a
single
situation
in
which
the
commission
did
not
decide
that
question
on
its
merits.
and
thus
far,
i
might
add,
there
have
been
five
courts
that
have
considered
such
commission
action
and
they
all
treated
it
as
a
decision
by
the
commission
on
the
merits
of
the
legal
issue
presented.
now,
in
this
case,
the
government,
if
i
may
say
so,
focuses
on
form
and
not
substance.
they
focus
on
the
language
of
the
letter
which
then
came
out
of
the
commission
after
they
had
resolved
the
issue
against
us.
now,
the
language
of
the
letter
was
that,
they
adopted
the
recommendation
of
the
division
of
corporation
finance
and
on
that
basis
would
take
no
action
against
dow.
the
emphasis
that
the
government
places
here
is
on
the
no
action
language
and
they
say
what
they
speculate,
that
possibly,
the
commission
somehow
bypassed
the
legal
issue
which
had
been
argued
to
it
by
the
parties
and
decided
to
take
no
action
against
dow
without
deciding
that
legal
issue.
but
i
should
emphasize
they
are
speculating
only
as
to
what
the
commission
may
have
done,
the
government
in
this
case
has
never
come
right
out
and
the
circuit
that
the
commission
sidestepped
the
legal
issue.
and
in
any
event,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
sidestepping
speculation,
if
you
will,
is
pretty
unrealistic.
obviously
the
commission
is
not
going
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
take
action
against
the
company
without
first
deciding
whether
the
company
is
right
on
the
law
or
wrong
on
the
law.
in
fact
as
mr.
cluther
rath's
reports
makes
clear
they
always
do
decide
the
legal
issue;
if
they
decide
the
company
is
wrong
on
the
law,
they
send
the
company
a
letter
and
say,
“we
think
you
are
wrong,
and
we
think
that
the
law,
that
is,
the
proxy
rules,
require
that
you
include
this
proposal
in
your
proxy
material”.
on
the
other
hand,
if
they
decide
the
company
is
right
on
the
law,
they
send
out
a
no-action
letter.
now,
that
is
what
actually
happens.
now,
let
me
talk
for
a
moment
about
the
practical
impact
upon
the
parties,
when
a
commission
decision
has
been
rendered.
in
a
case
where
the
commission
decides
that
the
company
is
wrong
on
the
legal
issue,
as
a
practical
matter,
the
shareholder
can
relax,
his
worries
are
over.
faced
with
that
position
by
the
commission,
the
company
knows
it
has
two
choices,
it
can
either
bow
to
the
commission's
ruling
of
the
law
and
include
the
proposal
in
its
proxy
materials
or
on
the
other
hand,
it
can
ignore
the
commission’s
ruling
but
if
does
so,
it
faces
very
severe
sanctions.
at
the
first
place
in
that
situation,
the
commission
can
institute
an
administrative
proceeding
looking
toward
de-listing
of
the
company's
securities
for
violation
of
the
proxy
rules.
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
entirely
so,
mr.
justice,
yes.
i
am
not
saying
that
anyone
of
these
sanctions
must
be
taken
by
the
commission
but
the
company
knows
they
are
at
hazard
and
they
run
this
risk.
now
one
risk
is
an
administrative
proceeding
against
them
for
de-listing
of
the
securities,
another
is
in
an
egregious
case
of
criminal
prosecution
by
the
attorney
general
at
the
request
of
the
commission
that
most
likely
as
a
practical
matter
is
a
civil
suit
by
the
commission
against
the
company
for
injunctive
relief
to
compel
the
company
to
include
the
proposal
in
the
proxy
materials.
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
indeed.
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
absolutely
correct,
mr.
justice.
in
the
entire
history
of
the
securities
act,
there
has
only
been
one
company
who
ever
declined
to
abide
by
the
commissions
ruling,
that
was
transamerican
corporation,
they
were
probably
sued
by
the
commission,
they
lost
the
case,
that
was
in
1947
more
than
20
years
ago.
no
company,
since
that
time
has
ever
defied
the
commission’s
ruling.
in
other
words,
no
shareholder
in
history
has
ever
had
to
take
any
action
to
defend
his
rights,
once
the
commission
has
ruled
in
its
favor
on
that
issue
and
i
suggest
that
is
entirely
as
it
should
be
one
of
the
principal
responsibilities
of
the
sec
is
to
serve
as
the
guardian
of
corporate
shareholders.
now,
i
have
discussed
the
shareholder
who
wins
before
the
commission
but
compare
his
situation
with
a
fellow
who
loses.
if
the
commission,
let
us
assume,
erroneously
decides
against
the
shareholder
in
this
dispute
which
they
have
brought
before
themselves,
then
of
course
that
shareholder
has
been
wrong
and
he
suffers
a
number
of
distinct
practical
ways.
in
the
first
place,
he
has
been
wrongfully
deprived
of
the
commissions
very
effective
help.
secondly,
if
he
wants
to
vindicate
his
rights,
he
must
undertake
the
expensive
litigation.
he
has
no
other
choice.
thirdly,
in
that
litigation,
wherever
it
occurs,
the
court
involved
is
likely
to
give
great
weight
perhaps
even
decisive
weight
to
the
commission’s
ruling,
adverse
ruling
on
the
question
of
law
involved.
prior
to
this
case
--
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
i
think
not,
your
honor.
and
let
me,
as
far
as
the
district
court
is
concerned,
let
me
mention
that
there
have
been,
before
this
case,
only
three
law
suits
brought
in
district
court.
in
each
case,
the
commission
had
ruled
adversely
to
the
shareholders
and
in
each
case,
the
court
said,
“ah,
you
are
faced
with
an
adverse
determination
by
the
commission,
they
are
an
expert
body,
they
have
interpreted
their
own
proxy
rules,
i
am
going
to
give
great
weight
to
that.
i
think
it
is
unlikely
that
you
are
going
to
prevail
on
the
merits
and
i
deny
you
preliminary
injunctive
relief”.
that
is
a
very
--
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
that
is
correct
and
i
suggest
mr.
justice
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
situation
where
the
agency
of
which
complaint
is
made
is
before
the
court
and
is
arguing
its
case
and
presenting
its
position.
in
a
situation
like
that,
the
court
is
entirely
confident
to
pass
on
whatever
the
legal
question
will
be
or
maybe
presented,
and
no
great
weight
then
is
going
to
be
given
to
the
administrative
interpretation
of
the
law.
but
the
situation
i
suggest
is
otherwise
where
the
commission
is
not
pressed,
you
have
district
court
litigation
between
the
shareholder
and
dow
chemical
company,
all
you
have
is
a
commission
interpretation
of
its
rules,
the
district
judge,
a
busy
man,
being
asked
to
enjoin
the
shareholder's
meeting
or
take
some
other
drastic
step.
he
cannot
ask
the
commission
for
its
views.
he
does
not
have
them
before
him
in
the
litigation.
he
simply
accepts
the
fact
that
the
commission
has
interpreted
its
rules.
it
has
interpreted
those
rules
against
the
shareholder.
he
says
the
commission’s
view
is
entitled
to
great
weight,
that
is
the
end
of
the
matter.
now
that
has
happened
in
the
only
cases
that
had
ever
come
up
in
district
court.
i
do
not
say
that
it
should
not
have
happened
that
way,
i
am
simply
saying
that
that
is
the
lesson
of
history.
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
i
think
not.
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
i
should
not.
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
that
is
correct
and
we
do
not
say
that
the
shareholder
--
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
no
quite,
mr.
justice.
our
position
is
that
what
happens
in
fact,
is
that
the
commission
decides
the
legal
issue.
now
at
that
point,
we
cannot
and
we
do
not
claim
the
right
to
require
the
commission
to
take
any
particular
action.
but
if
they
--
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
the
court
of
appeals,
mr.
justice,
remanded
to
the
commission
simply
with
the
request
that
they
clarify
their
reasoning,
that
the
court
of
appeals
looked
at
the
commission’s
reasoning
on
the
merits
and
said
in
effect,
“we
simply
do
not
understand,
how
you
have
to
come
out
that
way
and
we
would
like
you
to
clarify
your
reasoning
on
the
legal
issue”,
so
that
the
if
an
error
of
law
that
had
been
made
by
the
commission,
it
could
be
rectified
by
the
court.
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
let
me
put
it
this
way,
if
the
case
now
goes
back
as
we
think
it
should
to
the
commission,
the
commission
will
then
explain
how
it
reached
this
conclusion.
if
the
commission
says
--
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
we
could
take
it
back
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
aalike
declaration
of
what
the
law
really
says.
we
would
not
--
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
we
would
get
no
coercive
action
at
all.
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
what
this
committee
would
get
is
an
explanation
of
the
law
by
the
court
of
appeals.
that
is
a
direct
legal
principle
that
should
govern
the
commission.
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
the
good
that
it
would
do,
i
submit,
is
that
the
commission
would
obey
or
would
follow
the
principle
enunciated
by
the
court.
this
is
if
you
will
--
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
it
would
not
need
to,
but
we
are
quite
--
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
that
is
correct.
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
well,
that
in
fact
does
not
happen
and
let
me
remind
the
court,
if
i
may,
that
in
such
case
as
abbott
laboratories
against
gardner,
the
only
thing
that
was
requested
of
the
court
was
a
declaratory
judgment,
that
is
a
declaration
of
what
the
law
really
is.
and
abbott
laboratories
was
content
with
that
relief.
they
got
it
and
they
got,
it
was
a
very
practical
remedy.
let
me
remind
you
that
in
the
case
of
perkins
against
elg,
this
was
the
case
where
the
lady
had
been
denied
the
passport
and
she
suggested
that
she
had
been
denied
that
passport,
incidentally
the
issuance
of
passport
is
a
discretionary
function.
but
the
secretary
had
denied
her
the
passport
because
he
ruled
that
she
was
legally
ineligible.
what
this
court
did
was
review
that
legal
determination
and
say
if
she
is
legally
eligible,
the
secretary
can
not
deny
the
passport
on
that
ground.
he
may
be
able
to
deny
the
passport
on
some
other
ground
but
not
on
the
basis
of
a
legal
error.
it
was
a
declaration
then
of
the
correct
legal
principles,
it
was
not
a
coercive
form
of
decree.
we
did
not,
in
the
court
of
appeals
ask
for
a
coercive
form
of
decree
and
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
misunderstandings
we
have
with
the
solicitor
general.
he
suggests
that
we
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
said
and
we
want
you,
the
court
of
appeals,
to
direct
the
commission
to
start
enforcement
proceedings
against
dow.
that
is
not
we
did.
if
you
read
our
petition
--
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
well,
i
will
mr.
justice.
thank
you
for
inviting
my
attention
to
that.
first
of
all,
it
is
not
in
the
record
that
the
company
has
stopped
manufacturing
napalm,
i
gather
it
is
the
fact.
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
it
is
also
the
fact,
not
in
the
record,
that
they
immediately
announced
that
they
wanted
to
get
that
contract
back
again
and
resume
supplying
napalm
to
the
government
so
that
as
far
as
that
fact
is
concerned,
i
think
it
is
simply
besides
the
point.
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
it
was,
after
we
had
fought
for
it
two
years,
they
finally
bowed
to
the
court
of
appeal's
view
of
the
law
and
said,
“we
are
reserving
all
rights
to
exclude
that
next
time
around”,
they
made
it
very
clear
that
the
next
time
around,
they
are
reserving
the
right
to
exclude
our
proposal
on
legal
grounds.
but
this
time
they
put
it
in
the
proxy
materials.
now,
it
is
the
firm
intention
of
this
organization
to
submit
this
proposal
again.
it
has
an
affirmative
right
to
do
that
under
the
proxy
rules.
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
or
intending
to.
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
the
proposal
as
your
honor
is
aware,
submitted
by
this
shareholder
was
that
the
certificate
of
incorporation
of
the
company
be
modified,
amended
so
a
to
foreclose
it
from
manufacturing
napalm.
now,
that
is
a
continuing
problem.
the
company
has
un-publicly
announced
that
it
intends
--
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
we
are
going
to
resubmit
this
probably
let
us
say
within
20
months
after
this
court’s
decisions
in
this
case.
presumably
dow
will
exclude
it
once
more,
presumably
the
commission
will
rule
against
us
and
we
will
find
ourselves
in
exactly
this
same
controversy
again.
now,
the
government
represented
to
the
court,
this
was
an
important
issue
of
judicial
review
that
was
involved,
there
have
been
no
facts
that
have
come
in
to
existence
that
were
not
in
existence
when
the
government
submitted
the
case
to
you
and
when
they
briefed
it
to
you
and
we
rely
on
the
very
cases
that
they
have
cited
in
their
papers
to
the
effect
that
this
case
is
not
moot.
now,
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
spend
one
moment
on
the
review
statute
with
which
we
are
dealing.
that
statute
says
in
effect
that
if
we
were
a
party
to
a
proceeding
before
the
commission,
if
the
commission
took
final
action
in
our
case
and
if
were
agreed
by
that
action,
we
are
affirmatively
entitled
to
judicial
review.
i
submit
that
we
fall
squarely
within
the
language
of
that
statute.
we
were
a
party,
to
a
proceeding
before
the
commission.
the
commission
took
final
action
in
our
case,
they
had
required
us
to
appear.
we
did
not
want
to
but
they
did.
we
were
agreed
by
that
final
action
and
i
suggest
that
we
therefore
fall
squarely
within
the
terms
of
the
review
statute
that
is
presented.
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
the
suggestion
being
that
a
telephone
call
that
a
staff
member
made
to
some
representative
of
the
shareholder,
the
content
of
which
is
not
disclosed
in
this
record,
triggered
the
statutory
period
for
appeal.
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
that
is
right.
that
is
a
different
issue.
assuming
we
have
an
order,
the
first
notice
we
got
of
it
was
when
they
sent
us
a
letter,
and
except
for
the
phone
call.
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
we
did
not.
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
what
was
said
during
that
phone
call,
whether
we
got
an
accurate
description
of
the
commission’s
action
or
whether
we
did
it.
we
waited
six
days
and
we
got
a
letter
which
told
us
what
the
commission
had
done.
and
with
all
due
respect,
i
submit
that
this
court's
decision
in
schofield
against
the
nlrb
in
394
us,
makes
it
very
clear
that
the
agreed
party
in
entitled
to
receive
a
final
definite
word
as
to
what
has
happened
to
it
before
the
60-day
period
against
their
run.
mr.
roberts
b.
owen
that
would
be
correct,
if
there
is
no
order,
i
think
the
red
lion
broadcasting
case
makes
clear
there
is
an
order.
let
me
say
in
conclusion
that
we
are
hard
pressed
to
understand
why
we
should
not
be
entitled
to
the
judicial
review
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
we
did
not
voluntarily
present
our
legal
problems
to
the
commission.
the
commission
required
us
to
submit
to
its
decision
making
process.
we
follow
the
commission’s
rule,
the
agency
then
decided
that
we
were
legally
ineligible
to
enjoy
a
right
which
we
think
the
law
has
conferred
upon
us.
if
that
administrative
decision
was
wrong,
we
have
clearly
been
hurt
and
we
believe
that
courts
should
be
and
are
available
to
rectify
such
errors.
