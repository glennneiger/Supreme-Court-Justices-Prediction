justice

stewart
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
am
curious
this
is
brought
up
only
in
the
reply
brief
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
solicitor
general,
would
it
make
any
difference
if
the
parties
could
go
to
the
district
court
and
to
court
injunction?
or
do
you
think
they
could?
justice
potter
stewart
so
their
claim
must
be
that
the
proxy
material
was
not
adequate?
justice
potter
stewart
the
medical
committee
if
they
went
to
the
district
court,
they
would
claim
that
the
proxy
material
was
not
adequate.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
mean
the
proxy
that
was
sent
out
or--
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
not
adequate.
it
did
not,
in
the
sense
of
that,
it
did
not
disclose
what
it
should
have
disclosed.
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
government
is
not
contending
that
this
committee
does
not
have
a
standing
or
does
not
have
a
case
of
controversy
with
dow
under
the
statute,
so
that
there
would
not
be
a
federal
question
in
the
district
court.
justice
potter
stewart
so
it
is
a
question
that
which
court
should
it
be
and
a
question
of
reviewability?
justice
potter
stewart
well
does
the
sec
regulations
or
procedures
provide
for
securing
any
kind
of
declaratory
relief?
justice
potter
stewart
for
getting
any
kind
of
declaratory
relief?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
no
way
that
dow,
for
example,
could
come
in
and
say
we
want
a
declaratory
order
as
to
the
adequacy
of
the
proxy
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
regulations?
justice
potter
stewart
we
are
talking
about
the
practical
facts.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
way
this
works,
as
a
matter
of
practical
fact
if
the
company
does
get
that
kind
of
work
from
the
commission
that
includes
the
material,
does
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
or
it
could
say
we
agree
with
you
and
that
is
very
interesting
but
we
are
not
going
to
do
anything
about
it?
