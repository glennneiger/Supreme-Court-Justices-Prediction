we
will
hear
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
against
the
national
committee,
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
excuse
me,
can
i
interrupt
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
i
detected
in
mr.
justice
white’s
question
something
out
of
the
case
where
the
commission
was
asked
to
exercise
its
discretion
and
decline
to
do
anything,
what
would
be
the
remedy
if
they
paid
no
attention
to
our
request?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
require
them
to
exercise
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
no
procedure
against
the
commission
to
require
to
exercise
its
statutory
duty
or
discretionary
duty?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i
was
assuming
a
case
where
it
refused
to
do
anything,
it
did
not
exercise
its
discretion
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
solicitor
general.
mr.
owen.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
the
company
just
ignore
that
in
the
sense
of
defaulting?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
i
mean,
when
the
protest
is
made
with
the
commission,
suppose
the
company
regard
that
its
so
privileged
that
they
just
do
not
want
to
bother
responding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
they
must
respond?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
for
an
example
the
request
to
put
it
in
the
proxy
was,
“please
indicate
your
choice
or
president
in
the
next
election”,
they
wanted
that
put
it
in
the
proxy
statement,
do
you
mean
that
the
company
must
respond
to
that
frivolous
request?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
still
leaves
the
option
up
to
the
company,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
certainly
is
not
true.
you
are
speaking
of
just
three
cases.
that
is
not
true
as
to
icc
review,
there
are
many
instances
where
district
courts
have
not,
all
the
three-judge
district
court,
have
not
given
automatic
approval
to
an
icc
ruling.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
owen,
you
have
only
got
about
five
minutes
left,
i
hope
you
are
going
to
save
some
time
to
tell
us
why
this
is
still
a
live
controversy
in
the
light
of
the
action
on
the
proxy
statement
doing
just
what
you
wanted
and
in
light
of
the
fact
that
they
have
stopped
manufacturing
napalm.
