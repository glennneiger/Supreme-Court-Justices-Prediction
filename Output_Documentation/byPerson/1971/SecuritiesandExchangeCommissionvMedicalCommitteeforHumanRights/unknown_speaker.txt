unknown
speaker
this
sounds
so
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
would
think
that
in
allocating
this
job
for
the
commission
that
congress
did
not
intend
any
party
to
have
a
cause
of
action
in
the
district
court.
unknown
speaker
alright.
unknown
speaker
alright.
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
then
that
if
the
medical
committee
could
have
gone
to
the
district
court,
it
would
not
have
been
going
there
under
the
federal
questions
of
jurisdiction?
and
it
could
not
assert
a
cause
of
action
on
the
federal
statute?
unknown
speaker
and
their
claim
would
be
that
under
the
federal
law,
the
proxies
set
out,
must
be
adequate?
unknown
speaker
what
if
dow
had
completely
ignored
the
--
had
never
submitted
anything
to
the
commission
and
purported
although
there
had
been
submissions
to
it
by
the
medical
committee
and
they
have
started
to
send
out
the
proxy,
i
suppose
the
medical
committee
under
one
of
the
district
court
would
say
the
procedures
are
have
not
been
complied
with?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
commission
has
authority
to
go
in
the
court
for
an
injunction,
to
enjoin
inadequate
--
there
is
no
question
about
that.
unknown
speaker
mr.
owen,
on
what
do
you
base
that
statement.
is
it
not
shear
speculation,
is
it
not
just
as
likely
the
court
of
appeals
may
do
the
same
thing
on
the
review
actions
such
as
this
one?
unknown
speaker
how?
unknown
speaker
or
it
would
not
need
to.
unknown
speaker
it
could
say
we
will
use
the
power
of
the
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
how
about
the,
perhaps
you
have
touched
on
it
and
it
is
the
government's
point
with
respect
to
the
time
limitation
in
section
25a
of
the
34
act,
the
60-day
provision.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
says
60
days
after
the
entry
of
the
order,
of
course,
the
government
says
there
was
no
order.
unknown
speaker
well,
except
for
the
phone
call,
you
did
get
notice
in
the
phone
call.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
the
government
really
could
--
if
there
is
no
order
that
there
could
not
have
been
any
entry
of
any
order.
unknown
speaker
this
sounds
