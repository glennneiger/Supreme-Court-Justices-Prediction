mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals,
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
it
arises
under
section
14a
of
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934
relating
to
proxy
solicitation
and
under
the
regulations,
under
that
act
and
it
raises
questions
of
the
reviewability
of
action
or
non-action
of
the
commission
with
respect
to
proxy
materials.
the
text
of
section
14a
is
printed
on
page
49
of
the
commission’s
brief.
it
makes
it
unlawful
to
use
the
facilities
of
the
mails
or
of
interstate
commerce
or
of
an
exchange
in
contravention
of
such
rules
and
regulations
as
the
commission
may
prescribe
as
necessary
or
appropriate
in
the
public
interest
or
for
the
protection
of
investors
to
solicit
or
permit
the
use
of
his
name
to
solicit
any
proxy
or
consent
with
respect
to
any
security.
but
that
is
simply
a
delegation
through
the
commission
to
make
rules
with
respect
to
proxies
in
the
public
interest
or
for
the
protection
of
investors.
and
at
this
point
i
would
also
like
to
bring
to
the
court’s
attention
a
section
2e
of
the
securities,
section
21e
of
the
securities
and
exchange
act
of
34
which
is
also
printed
on
page
49
of
the
government’s
brief,
which
authorizes
the
commission,
whenever
it
appears
that
there
is
a
violation
of
the
act
or
about
to
be
a
violation
of
the
act,
it
may
in
its
discretion
bring
an
action
in
the
appropriate
united
states
districts
court.
finally,
i
would
call
attention
to
the
regulations
which
the
commission
has
made
under
section
14a,
specifically
those
relating
to
proposals
of
security
holders
which
is
rule
14a-8
of
the
commission
rules
that
is
rather
long
but
it
is
set
out
in
full
on
pages
51
to
55
of
the
commission’s
brief.
and
with
this
as
the
legal
setting,
i
turn
to
the
facts.
the
respondent
here
is
the
medical
committee
on
human
rights.
the
record
does
not
show
whether
it
is
a
corporation
or
a
voluntary
association
and
nor
does
it
show
how
the
committee
is
made
up
or
how
its
spokesman
are
authorized.
the
record
does
show
that
early
in
1968,
it
acquired
by
gift
five
shares
of
the
common
stock
of
dow
chemical
corporation,
a
delaware
corporation.
even
before
the
shares
were
registered
in
its
name,
it
made
a
request
on
the
company
to
include
a
proposal
and
its
proxy
material
for
the
1968
annual
meeting
of
dow,
that
request
related
to
the
sale
of
napalm
by
dow,
but
it
came
too
late
for
action
at
the
1968
meeting.
early
in
1969,
the
medical
committee
sent
a
new
request
to
dow
asking
that
they
be
submitted
to
the
dow
shareholders
in
dow’s
proxy
solicitation
for
the
1969
annual
meeting.
a
proposal
requesting
that
the
company’s
charter
be
amended
with
respect
to
the
sale
of
napalm.
that
appears
on
pages
10
and
12
of
the
appendix.
on
the
advise
of
its
general
counsel,
dow
decided
to
omit
the
proposal
in
accordance
with
rule
14a-8(d)
dow
notified
both
the
committee
and
the
commission
of
its
decision
stating
its
reasons
and
including
an
opinion
of
counsel
as
required
by
the
rule.
the
committee
then
modified
this
proposal
so
that
it
would
propose
a
resolution
which
would
amend
the
company’s
bylaws
so
as
to
prohibit
the
manufacturer
of
napalm
and
asked
the
commission
staff
to
review
the
matter.
on
february
16,
1969,
the
commission
staff
informed
the
committee
and
dow
that
it
would
not
recommend
any
action
to
the
commission
if
the
proposal
was
omitted
from
dow’s
proxy
material.
the
committee’s
counsel
then
asked
that
the
commission
itself
review
the
staff’s
position.
and
on
march
24th
1969,
the
commission
as
shown
by
its
minute
book,
“determined
to
raise
no
objection
to
the
omission
from
the
management’s
proxy
statement
of
certain
resolutions
proposed
by
the
medical
committee
for
human
rights”.
now,
i
would
suggest
that
this
is
a
little
like
a
denial
of
a
writ
of
certiorari
by
this
court,
which
amounts
to
a
statement
that
this
court
will
take
no
action
with
respect
to
a
decision
below
and
is
not
in
anyway
a
decision
by
this
court
as
to
the
merits
of
the
case.
on
may
29th,
66
days
after
the
commission’s
no
action
determination,
the
committee
filed
a
petition
for
review
of
the
commission’s
action
in
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
and
this
brings
us
to
a
threshold
difficulty
with
the
case.
the
statute
under
which
this
proceeding
was
brought.
section
25a
of
the
securities
exchange
act
printed
on
page
50
of
the
commission’s
brief
provides
that
a
petition
for
review
maybe
filed
“within
60
days
after
the
entry
of
such
order”.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
was
referred
to
in
the
main
brief,
i
suggest
that
it
is
jurisdictional
and
i
simply
want
to
submit
it
for
the
court’s
consideration
on
that
basis.
it
is
certainly
noble
to
say
that
an
order
is
not
entered
until
a
written
notice
of
it
is
given.
here
a
notice
was
given
by
telephone
on
the
day
the
order
was
entered.
there
is
no
requirement
with
respect
to
this
court’s
judgments
or
with
respect
to
the
judgments
that
this
court
reviews,
that
the
date
of
entry
of
the
order
and
after
that
is
what
congress
said
was
the
entry
of
the
order
is
deferred
until
written
notice
is
given
and
if
it
is
jurisdictional,
it
seems
to
me
appropriate
that
i
should
lay
it
before
the
court
for
its
consideration.
but
assuming
that
there
is
jurisdiction,
we
come
to
the
questions
of
administrative
law
which
have
been
briefed
by
the
parties.
these
are
discussed
at
length
in
the
principal
brief
which
had
been
filed.
the
argument
can
become
rather
extensive
and
complex
and
this
has
been
developed
fully
and
i
hope
carefully
in
our
briefs,
i
hope
for
the
convenience
of
the
court.
in
this
oral
argument,
i
want
to
try
to
focus
on
two
aspects
which
seem
to
me
to
be
of
particular
importance.
the
real
controversy
underlying
this
case
is
between
the
medical
committee
and
dow
chemical
company.
yet
dow
is
not
a
party
here
and
will
not
be
bound
by
the
decision
of
this
court.
the
commission
has
no
machinery
to
adjudicate
proxy
disputes,
nor
could
it
as
a
practical
matter
adjudicate
such
disputes
within
the
very
short
time
available
during
the
proxy
season.
actually
the
commission
staff
reviews
something
like
5000
sets
of
proxy
material
per
year,
mostly
within
a
period
of
three
months
in
the
early
part
of
the
year.
necessarily,
the
work
is
largely
done
by
the
staff
of
the
commission,
it
is
truly
a
matter
of
administration.
i
think,
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
has
a
relatively
high
reputation
for
the
quality
of
its
work
and
it
may
well
be
because
of
the
capacity
it
had
shown
to
develop
these
administrative
activities
within
the
framework
of
its
establishment.
only
a
few
matters
can
be
referred
to
the
commission
itself.
neither
the
staff
nor
the
commission
has
power
to
issue
any
orders
with
respect
to
proxies.
nor
can
the
court
of
appeals
below
direct
the
commission
to
take
any
affirmative
action
with
respect
to
proxy
matters
by
the
very
terms
of
the
statute
that
is
committed
to
the
commission
“in
its
discretion”.
all
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
purported
to
do
here
is
to
require
the
commission
to
make
a
statement
with
respect
to
a
question
of
law
which
would
not
necessarily
control
the
commission's
action.
indeed,
the
medical
committee
now
urges
in
its
brief
at
page
21,
that
its
petition
for
review
sought
to
review
only
“the
legal
determination”,
that
it
presumes
the
commission
made
when
it
declined
the
institute
and
the
enforcement
action,
that
i
think
is
a
little
bit
like
asking
this
court
to
certify
what
its
view
was
as
to
the
merits
of
a
case
when
it
denies
certiorari.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
that
is
the
remedy,
mr.
justice.
the
medical
committee
was
entirely
free
to
go
to
the
district
court
and
seek
an
order
on
dow
chemical
company
which
could
then
be
litigated
with
those
two
parties.
that
under
delaware
law,
it
was
required
to
submit
this
and
that
under
the
proxy
rules
of
the
commission
it
was
required
to
submit
this
--
.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
whose
claim
was
it?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
medical
committee’s
claim
would
be
that
the
proxy
material
was
not
adequate
and
was
not
required
to
be
submitted
to
the
shareholders.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
the
proxy
that
the
dow
had
sent
out,
it
was
not
adequate,
yes.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
that
would
raise
questions
under
both
state
law
and
under
the
proxy
rules
which
would
be
subject
to
consideration
by
the
court
and
another
remedy
available
to
the
medical
committee
is
to
sent
out
its
own
proxy
materials,
at
its
own
expense.
a
large
part
of
the
problem
here
is
simply
who
is
going
to
pay
for
it.
the
medical
committee
is
entitled
under
the
proxy
rules
to
get
a
list
of
the
shareholders
and
to
mail
out
its
own
proxy
material
and
get
its
proxies
and
present
them
and
vote
them
at
the
meeting
and
no
one
raises
any
questions
about
that.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
may
well
be
a
case
of
controversy
with
dow
but
it
is
not
here
because
dow
is
not
in
this
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
in
part
whether
the
remedy
lies
in
the
district
court
as
provided
in
the
statute
or
to
put
the
same
thing
another
way,
whether
it
is
appropriate
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
seek
to
review
something
or
other
here
under
a
petition
for
review,
under
section
25a.
what
the
medical
committee
now
seeks
is
a
declaration
unrelated
to
relief
and
to
the
only
justiciable
controversy
that
has
ever
existed
in
this
matter,
that
is
between
the
medical
committee
and
dow.
the
only
place
where
the
medical
committee
can
get
that
relief
is
in
the
state
courts
of
delaware
or
in
the
appropriate
district
court
under
section
27.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
provide
for,
i
sorry
mr.
justice?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
none
whatever,
mr.
justice
that
i
know
of.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
suppose
the
dow
could
come
in,
but
the
commission
could
properly
dismiss
that
on
the
ground
that
there
is
no
provision
in
the
statute
for
such
a
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
nothing
in
the
regulations
which
would
authorize
that.
now
let
me
go
on
to
show
the
attenuated
nature
of
the
medical
committee's
decision,
which
i
think
is
shown
very
clearly
by
these
facts.
the
proposal
was
initially
submitted
for
the
annual
meeting
of
dow
in
may
1969.
that
meeting
was
held
two
and
a
half
years
ago
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
petition
for
review.
and
second,
subsequent
to
the
filing
of
the
petition
for
review,
dow
seized
to
manufacture
napalm
for
the
government.
it
does
not
now
manufacture
it
and
has
no
plans
for
continuing
to
do
so.
and
third,
finally
dow
did
include
the
medical
committee’s
resolution
in
dow’s
proxy
statement
for
its
annual
meeting
in
may
1971.
the
proposal
received
less
that
3%
of
the
vote
of
all
the
shareholders.
under
rule
14a-8
(c)
(4)
(i)
of
the
proxy
rules,
dow
may
exclude
this
proposal
from
its
proxy
materials
for
the
next
three
calendar
years.
thus
the
issue
cannot
arise
again
until
1975.
the
question
whether
the
medical
committee
will
make
similar
proposals
at
that
time
and
how
dow
will
treat
them
are
entirely
speculated.
and
thus,
the
medical
committee
has
obtained
everything
it
sought
in
this
litigation,
that
is,
the
distribution
of
its
proposal
by
dow
at
dow’s
expense
to
enable
the
security
holders
to
vote
on
it.
all
that
it
seeks
now
is
a
declaration
that
it
was
entitled
to
get
what
it
has
already
received
and
giving
such
a
declaration
after
the
event
is
not
the
proper
function
of
federal
courts
in
our
constitutional
system.
even
if
there
were
a
live
controversy
remaining
here,
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
would
be
wrong
in
our
submission.
the
basic
question
is
one
of
the
separation
of
powers
or
more
accurately
of
allocation
of
powers.
we
submit
that
the
administration
of
the
proxy
regulations
is
a
matter
which
congress
has
committed
to
the
administrative
process
without
provision
for
or
expectation
of
judicial
review
as
to
the
administrative
action.
not
all
issues
arising
in
our
governmental
operations
have
to
be
decided
by
courts.
and
where
the
problem
is
really
one
of
administration,
congress
may
well
choose
to
allocate
it
for
administrative
handling.
it
remains
of
course,
subject
to
the
continued
review
of
congress
through
changes
in
applicable
statute,
a
review
which
congress
has
never
found
it
necessary
to
exercise
in
this
area
over
more
than
35
years.
but
congress
deliberately
decided
to
allocate
this
matter
to
administrative
handling
without
court
review,
is
i
submit
shown
by
the
language
which
congress
used
in
the
statutes.
section
14a
of
the
act
laid
down
no
rules,
i
repeat,
laid
down
no
rules,
with
respect
to
proxies;
instead
it
allocated
the
area
to
the
commission.
the
congress
made
it
illegal
to
use
the
facilities
of
interstate
commerce
to
solicit
proxies
contrary
to
“set
rules
and
regulations
as
the
commission
may
prescribe”.
the
rules
are
the
commission's
by
a
complete
delegation
and
clearly
intended
allocation
by
congress.
in
an
area
so
amorphous,
it
seemed
reasonably
clear
that
congress
allocated
to
the
commission
not
only
the
making
of
the
rules
and
regulations,
but
also
the
function
of
determining
their
administration
and
their
enforcement
in
contrary
cases.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice,
not
at
all.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
cause
of
action
in
the
district
court
remains,
but
it
is
in
no
sense
a
review
of
the
commission's
action.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
the
cause
of
action
in
the
district
court
is
largely
based
on
state
law
and
congress
was
deliberately
not
enacting
a
federal
corporation
law,
was
deliberately
leading
the
underlying
problems
here
to
the
laws
of
the
state.
congress
was
simply
taking
action
to
provide
for
the
protection
of
investors
and
assigning
to
the
commission
the
function
of
seeing
to
it,
that
appropriate
steps
were
taken
for
the
protection
of
the
investors.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
on
the
contrary
mr.
justice,
i
think
the
medical
committee
had
two
choices.
it
could
have
gone
into
the
delaware
state
courts
as
a
matter
of
state
law
making
no
reference
to
the
federal
statute.
on
the
other
hand,
it
could
have
gone
into
the
appropriate
district
court,
which
i
assume
is
delaware,
but
i
have
not
checked
that
relying
on
the
proxy
rules
of
the
commission
and
also
on
state
law
in
which
case
the
statute
provides
that
the
district
court
shall
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
enforce
these
provisions.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
would
be
the
claim,
yes.
but
what
we
are
really
saying
is
that
they
are
not
entitled
to
have
the
support
of
the
commission
in
that
suit.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
medical
committee
could
itself
sue
and
i
would
think
of
it,
under
those
circumstances,
it
would
be
very
likely
that
the
commission
would
pick
up
the
ball
and
carry
it
itself
and
bring
the
suit
with
the
medical
committee
perhaps
as
a
party.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
in
light
of
that
section
25
provides
that
the
commission
“in
its
discretion”
may
bring
a
suit
to
enforce
the
statute
or
the
regulations.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
all
i
am
saying
is
i
do
not
think
that
the
commission
is
under
any
obligation
to
bring
such
a
suit
if
in
it
its
discretion,
it
thinks,
it
should
not.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
remedy
would
be
to
bring
a
suit
in
the
united
states
for
the
medical
committee,
to
bring
a
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
to
require
--
not
against
the
commission,
nor
against
dow.
to
require
dow
to
comply
with
(a)
the
state
law
and
(b)
with
the
proxy.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
you
change,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
is
no
statutory
duty,
there
is
a
duty
to
exercise
its
discretion,
there
is
not
a
slightest
doubt
that
it
did
exercise
this
discretion
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
would
be
another
case
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
commission
refused
to
do
anything,
that
would
be
an
extraordinarily
negative
order,
i
suppose.
but
it
might
be,
might
conceivably
be
subject
to
review,
as
an
utter
abusive
discretion.
but
no
suggestion
here
that
anything
of
that
sort
occurs.
if
all
questions
under
the
proxy
rules
are
subject
to
review
by
the
courts,
then
they
must
be
handled
differently,
as
i
have
already
said,
they
are
very
numerous.
if
they
are
subject
to
review,
there
must
be
a
thorough
record,
there
must
be
reasoned
opinions,
there
must
be
a
clearer
opportunity
for
the
intra-commission
review
for
all
of
which
there
is
no
time.
i
think,
it
was
emerson
who
said
that,
the
central
tragedy
of
life
is
that
there
are
only
24
hours
in
a
day.
congress
may
well
have
thought
it
better
for
the
whole
matter
to
be
handled
by
the
administrative
process
without
a
judicial
review.
and
support
for
this
is
found
in
other
provisions
of
the
statute.
the
allocation
of
the
area
to
the
commission
in
14a,
it
is
found
in
the
fact
that
congress
made
no
provisions
for
any
order
by
the
commission
in
the
area.
and
it
is
found
finally
that
it
expressly
allocated
the
enforcement
of
these
provisions
to
the
commission
in
its
discretion.
there
is
no
provision
that
this
essentially
administrative
determination
shall
be
made
by
the
courts
or
even
that
the
court
shall
have
power
to
review
the
commission’s
action
or
inaction,
unless
it
shall
appear
to
the
commission
that
there
is
about
to
be
a
violation
and
the
commission
in
its
discretion
brings
an
action
in
the
proper
court.
we
think
that
this
comes
well
within
the
language
which
the
court
used
in
the
case
of
schilling
v.
rogers
in
363
us
cited
on
pages
39
and
40
of
our
brief.
there
are
many
reasons
why
the
commission
might
conclude
that
it
would
take
no
action
and
not
every
case
taken
to
a
court
will
be
decided
by
that
court
as
is
evident
in
this
court’s
certiorari
jurisdiction.
another
analogy
that
naturally
occurred
to
me
is
that
not
every
case
can
be
taken
to
a
court,
even
though
there
maybe
a
basis
for
thinking
that
the
decision
is
wrong
and
that
there
should
review
as
is
evident
in
the
function
of
the
solicitor
general
to
decide
what
cases
to
appeal
and
what
cases
to
bring
to
this
court
on
petition
for
certiorari.
these
are
discretionary
functions
and
it
would
be
hard
to
give
a
consistently
reasoned
justification
for
every
decision
which
frequently
turns
on
other
considerations
than
the
merits
of
the
case.
and
there
would
not
be
time
to
give
such
reasons,
if
for
some
reasons
it
was
thought
that
it
had
to
be
done.
all
of
this,
it
seems
to
me
is
nicely
exemplified
in
the
present
case.
the
court
of
appeals
was
not
in
a
position
to
vindicate
any
right
of
the
medical
committee
that
can
be
done
only
in
a
district
court
in
an
action
to
enforce
compliance
with
the
proxy
rules.
the
court
of
appeals
cannot
order
the
commission
to
seek
enforcement.
there
is
no
provision
for
such
a
mandatory
order
in
section
25a
and
the
decision
to
seek
enforcement
has
been
expressly
committed
by
congress
to
the
discretion
of
the
commission.
all
that
the
court
of
appeals
can
do
in
this
case
is
to
express
its
view
of
the
law
applicable
to
a
controversy
between
the
medical
committee
and
dow,
that
not
has
not
been
presented
by
those
parties
for
the
court's
consideration
and
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
will
not
be
binding
on
the
district
court,
if
the
medical
committee
seeks
to
enforce
there,
its
rights
as
a
shareholder.
if
for
no
other
reason,
then
the
dow
is
not
a
party
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
is
not
in
anyway
bound
by
its
decision.
thus
the
present
procedural
posture
of
the
case
shows
clearly
enough
that
the
only
end
to
which
it
can
come
is
an
advisory
opinion
by
the
court
below
on
a
matter
as
to
which
the
court
can
require
no
action
to
be
taken
and
which
is
one
that
congress
has
expressly
allocated
for
good
reason
for
handling
by
the
administrative
process
and
not
by
the
courts,
the
judgment
should
be
reversed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals,
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
it
arises
under
section
14a
of
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934
relating
to
proxy
solicitation
and
under
the
regulations,
under
that
act
and
it
raises
questions
of
the
reviewability
of
action
or
non-action
of
the
commission
with
respect
to
proxy
materials.
the
text
of
section
14a
is
printed
on
page
49
of
the
commission’s
brief.
it
makes
it
unlawful
to
use
the
facilities
of
the
mails
or
of
interstate
commerce
or
of
an
exchange
in
contravention
of
such
rules
and
regulations
as
the
commission
may
prescribe
as
necessary
or
appropriate
in
the
public
interest
or
for
the
protection
of
investors
to
solicit
or
permit
the
use
of
his
name
to
solicit
any
proxy
or
consent
with
respect
to
any
security.
but
that
is
simply
a
delegation
through
the
commission
to
make
rules
with
respect
to
proxies
in
the
public
interest
or
for
the
protection
of
investors.
and
at
this
point
i
would
also
like
to
bring
to
the
court’s
attention
a
section
2e
of
the
securities,
section
21e
of
the
securities
and
exchange
act
of
34
which
is
also
printed
on
page
49
of
the
government’s
brief,
which
authorizes
the
commission,
whenever
it
appears
that
there
is
a
violation
of
the
act
or
about
to
be
a
violation
of
the
act,
it
may
in
its
discretion
bring
an
action
in
the
appropriate
united
states
districts
court.
finally,
i
would
call
attention
to
the
regulations
which
the
commission
has
made
under
section
14a,
specifically
those
relating
to
proposals
of
security
holders
which
is
rule
14a-8
of
the
commission
rules
that
is
rather
long
but
it
is
set
out
in
full
on
pages
51
to
55
of
the
commission’s
brief.
and
with
this
as
the
legal
setting,
i
turn
to
the
facts.
the
respondent
here
is
the
medical
committee
on
human
rights.
the
record
does
not
show
whether
it
is
a
corporation
or
a
voluntary
association
and
nor
does
it
show
how
the
committee
is
made
up
or
how
its
spokesman
are
authorized.
the
record
does
show
that
early
in
1968,
it
acquired
by
gift
five
shares
of
the
common
stock
of
dow
chemical
corporation,
a
delaware
corporation.
even
before
the
shares
were
registered
in
its
name,
it
made
a
request
on
the
company
to
include
a
proposal
and
its
proxy
material
for
the
1968
annual
meeting
of
dow,
that
request
related
to
the
sale
of
napalm
by
dow,
but
it
came
too
late
for
action
at
the
1968
meeting.
early
in
1969,
the
medical
committee
sent
a
new
request
to
dow
asking
that
they
be
submitted
to
the
dow
shareholders
in
dow’s
proxy
solicitation
for
the
1969
annual
meeting.
a
proposal
requesting
that
the
company’s
charter
be
amended
with
respect
to
the
sale
of
napalm.
that
appears
on
pages
10
and
12
of
the
appendix.
on
the
advise
of
its
general
counsel,
dow
decided
to
omit
the
proposal
in
accordance
with
rule
14a-8(d)
dow
notified
both
the
committee
and
the
commission
of
its
decision
stating
its
reasons
and
including
an
opinion
of
counsel
as
required
by
the
rule.
the
committee
then
modified
this
proposal
so
that
it
would
propose
a
resolution
which
would
amend
the
company’s
bylaws
so
as
to
prohibit
the
manufacturer
of
napalm
and
asked
the
commission
staff
to
review
the
matter.
on
february
16,
1969,
the
commission
staff
informed
the
committee
and
dow
that
it
would
not
recommend
any
action
to
the
commission
if
the
proposal
was
omitted
from
dow’s
proxy
material.
the
committee’s
counsel
then
asked
that
the
commission
itself
review
the
staff’s
position.
and
on
march
24th
1969,
the
commission
as
shown
by
its
minute
book,
“determined
to
raise
no
objection
to
the
omission
from
the
management’s
proxy
statement
of
certain
resolutions
proposed
by
the
medical
committee
for
human
rights”.
now,
i
would
suggest
that
this
is
a
little
like
a
denial
of
a
writ
of
certiorari
by
this
court,
which
amounts
to
a
statement
that
this
court
will
take
no
action
with
respect
to
a
decision
below
and
is
not
in
anyway
a
decision
by
this
court
as
to
the
merits
of
the
case.
on
may
29th,
66
days
after
the
commission’s
no
action
determination,
the
committee
filed
a
petition
for
review
of
the
commission’s
action
in
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
and
this
brings
us
to
a
threshold
difficulty
with
the
case.
the
statute
under
which
this
proceeding
was
brought.
section
25a
of
the
securities
exchange
act
printed
on
page
50
of
the
commission’s
brief
provides
that
a
petition
for
review
maybe
filed
“within
60
days
after
the
entry
of
such
order”.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
was
referred
to
in
the
main
brief,
i
suggest
that
it
is
jurisdictional
and
i
simply
want
to
submit
it
for
the
court’s
consideration
on
that
basis.
it
is
certainly
noble
to
say
that
an
order
is
not
entered
until
a
written
notice
of
it
is
given.
here
a
notice
was
given
by
telephone
on
the
day
the
order
was
entered.
there
is
no
requirement
with
respect
to
this
court’s
judgments
or
with
respect
to
the
judgments
that
this
court
reviews,
that
the
date
of
entry
of
the
order
and
after
that
is
what
congress
said
was
the
entry
of
the
order
is
deferred
until
written
notice
is
given
and
if
it
is
jurisdictional,
it
seems
to
me
appropriate
that
i
should
lay
it
before
the
court
for
its
consideration.
but
assuming
that
there
is
jurisdiction,
we
come
to
the
questions
of
administrative
law
which
have
been
briefed
by
the
parties.
these
are
discussed
at
length
in
the
principal
brief
which
had
been
filed.
the
argument
can
become
rather
extensive
and
complex
and
this
has
been
developed
fully
and
i
hope
carefully
in
our
briefs,
i
hope
for
the
convenience
of
the
court.
in
this
oral
argument,
i
want
to
try
to
focus
on
two
aspects
which
seem
to
me
to
be
of
particular
importance.
the
real
controversy
underlying
this
case
is
between
the
medical
committee
and
dow
chemical
company.
yet
dow
is
not
a
party
here
and
will
not
be
bound
by
the
decision
of
this
court.
the
commission
has
no
machinery
to
adjudicate
proxy
disputes,
nor
could
it
as
a
practical
matter
adjudicate
such
disputes
within
the
very
short
time
available
during
the
proxy
season.
actually
the
commission
staff
reviews
something
like
5000
sets
of
proxy
material
per
year,
mostly
within
a
period
of
three
months
in
the
early
part
of
the
year.
necessarily,
the
work
is
largely
done
by
the
staff
of
the
commission,
it
is
truly
a
matter
of
administration.
i
think,
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
has
a
relatively
high
reputation
for
the
quality
of
its
work
and
it
may
well
be
because
of
the
capacity
it
had
shown
to
develop
these
administrative
activities
within
the
framework
of
its
establishment.
only
a
few
matters
can
be
referred
to
the
commission
itself.
neither
the
staff
nor
the
commission
has
power
to
issue
any
orders
with
respect
to
proxies.
nor
can
the
court
of
appeals
below
direct
the
commission
to
take
any
affirmative
action
with
respect
to
proxy
matters
by
the
very
terms
of
the
statute
that
is
committed
to
the
commission
“in
its
discretion”.
all
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
purported
to
do
here
is
to
require
the
commission
to
make
a
statement
with
respect
to
a
question
of
law
which
would
not
necessarily
control
the
commission's
action.
indeed,
the
medical
committee
now
urges
in
its
brief
at
page
21,
that
its
petition
for
review
sought
to
review
only
“the
legal
determination”,
that
it
presumes
the
commission
made
when
it
declined
the
institute
and
the
enforcement
action,
that
i
think
is
a
little
bit
like
asking
this
court
to
certify
what
its
view
was
as
to
the
merits
of
a
case
when
it
denies
certiorari.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
that
is
the
remedy,
mr.
justice.
the
medical
committee
was
entirely
free
to
go
to
the
district
court
and
seek
an
order
on
dow
chemical
company
which
could
then
be
litigated
with
those
two
parties.
that
under
delaware
law,
it
was
required
to
submit
this
and
that
under
the
proxy
rules
of
the
commission
it
was
required
to
submit
this
--
.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
whose
claim
was
it?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
medical
committee’s
claim
would
be
that
the
proxy
material
was
not
adequate
and
was
not
required
to
be
submitted
to
the
shareholders.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
the
proxy
that
the
dow
had
sent
out,
it
was
not
adequate,
yes.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
that
would
raise
questions
under
both
state
law
and
under
the
proxy
rules
which
would
be
subject
to
consideration
by
the
court
and
another
remedy
available
to
the
medical
committee
is
to
sent
out
its
own
proxy
materials,
at
its
own
expense.
a
large
part
of
the
problem
here
is
simply
who
is
going
to
pay
for
it.
the
medical
committee
is
entitled
under
the
proxy
rules
to
get
a
list
of
the
shareholders
and
to
mail
out
its
own
proxy
material
and
get
its
proxies
and
present
them
and
vote
them
at
the
meeting
and
no
one
raises
any
questions
about
that.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
may
well
be
a
case
of
controversy
with
dow
but
it
is
not
here
because
dow
is
not
in
this
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
in
part
whether
the
remedy
lies
in
the
district
court
as
provided
in
the
statute
or
to
put
the
same
thing
another
way,
whether
it
is
appropriate
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
seek
to
review
something
or
other
here
under
a
petition
for
review,
under
section
25a.
what
the
medical
committee
now
seeks
is
a
declaration
unrelated
to
relief
and
to
the
only
justiciable
controversy
that
has
ever
existed
in
this
matter,
that
is
between
the
medical
committee
and
dow.
the
only
place
where
the
medical
committee
can
get
that
relief
is
in
the
state
courts
of
delaware
or
in
the
appropriate
district
court
under
section
27.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
provide
for,
i
sorry
mr.
justice?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
none
whatever,
mr.
justice
that
i
know
of.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
suppose
the
dow
could
come
in,
but
the
commission
could
properly
dismiss
that
on
the
ground
that
there
is
no
provision
in
the
statute
for
such
a
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
nothing
in
the
regulations
which
would
authorize
that.
now
let
me
go
on
to
show
the
attenuated
nature
of
the
medical
committee's
decision,
which
i
think
is
shown
very
clearly
by
these
facts.
the
proposal
was
initially
submitted
for
the
annual
meeting
of
dow
in
may
1969.
that
meeting
was
held
two
and
a
half
years
ago
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
petition
for
review.
and
second,
subsequent
to
the
filing
of
the
petition
for
review,
dow
seized
to
manufacture
napalm
for
the
government.
it
does
not
now
manufacture
it
and
has
no
plans
for
continuing
to
do
so.
and
third,
finally
dow
did
include
the
medical
committee’s
resolution
in
dow’s
proxy
statement
for
its
annual
meeting
in
may
1971.
the
proposal
received
less
that
3%
of
the
vote
of
all
the
shareholders.
under
rule
14a-8
(c)
(4)
(i)
of
the
proxy
rules,
dow
may
exclude
this
proposal
from
its
proxy
materials
for
the
next
three
calendar
years.
thus
the
issue
cannot
arise
again
until
1975.
the
question
whether
the
medical
committee
will
make
similar
proposals
at
that
time
and
how
dow
will
treat
them
are
entirely
speculated.
and
thus,
the
medical
committee
has
obtained
everything
it
sought
in
this
litigation,
that
is,
the
distribution
of
its
proposal
by
dow
at
dow’s
expense
to
enable
the
security
holders
to
vote
on
it.
all
that
it
seeks
now
is
a
declaration
that
it
was
entitled
to
get
what
it
has
already
received
and
giving
such
a
declaration
after
the
event
is
not
the
proper
function
of
federal
courts
in
our
constitutional
system.
even
if
there
were
a
live
controversy
remaining
here,
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
would
be
wrong
in
our
submission.
the
basic
question
is
one
of
the
separation
of
powers
or
more
accurately
of
allocation
of
powers.
we
submit
that
the
administration
of
the
proxy
regulations
is
a
matter
which
congress
has
committed
to
the
administrative
process
without
provision
for
or
expectation
of
judicial
review
as
to
the
administrative
action.
not
all
issues
arising
in
our
governmental
operations
have
to
be
decided
by
courts.
and
where
the
problem
is
really
one
of
administration,
congress
may
well
choose
to
allocate
it
for
administrative
handling.
it
remains
of
course,
subject
to
the
continued
review
of
congress
through
changes
in
applicable
statute,
a
review
which
congress
has
never
found
it
necessary
to
exercise
in
this
area
over
more
than
35
years.
but
congress
deliberately
decided
to
allocate
this
matter
to
administrative
handling
without
court
review,
is
i
submit
shown
by
the
language
which
congress
used
in
the
statutes.
section
14a
of
the
act
laid
down
no
rules,
i
repeat,
laid
down
no
rules,
with
respect
to
proxies;
instead
it
allocated
the
area
to
the
commission.
the
congress
made
it
illegal
to
use
the
facilities
of
interstate
commerce
to
solicit
proxies
contrary
to
“set
rules
and
regulations
as
the
commission
may
prescribe”.
the
rules
are
the
commission's
by
a
complete
delegation
and
clearly
intended
allocation
by
congress.
in
an
area
so
amorphous,
it
seemed
reasonably
clear
that
congress
allocated
to
the
commission
not
only
the
making
of
the
rules
and
regulations,
but
also
the
function
of
determining
their
administration
and
their
enforcement
in
contrary
cases.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice,
not
at
all.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
cause
of
action
in
the
district
court
remains,
but
it
is
in
no
sense
a
review
of
the
commission's
action.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
the
cause
of
action
in
the
district
court
is
largely
based
on
state
law
and
congress
was
deliberately
not
enacting
a
federal
corporation
law,
was
deliberately
leading
the
underlying
problems
here
to
the
laws
of
the
state.
congress
was
simply
taking
action
to
provide
for
the
protection
of
investors
and
assigning
to
the
commission
the
function
of
seeing
to
it,
that
appropriate
steps
were
taken
for
the
protection
of
the
investors.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
on
the
contrary
mr.
justice,
i
think
the
medical
committee
had
two
choices.
it
could
have
gone
into
the
delaware
state
courts
as
a
matter
of
state
law
making
no
reference
to
the
federal
statute.
on
the
other
hand,
it
could
have
gone
into
the
appropriate
district
court,
which
i
assume
is
delaware,
but
i
have
not
checked
that
relying
on
the
proxy
rules
of
the
commission
and
also
on
state
law
in
which
case
the
statute
provides
that
the
district
court
shall
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
enforce
these
provisions.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
would
be
the
claim,
yes.
but
what
we
are
really
saying
is
that
they
are
not
entitled
to
have
the
support
of
the
commission
in
that
suit.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
medical
committee
could
itself
sue
and
i
would
think
of
it,
under
those
circumstances,
it
would
be
very
likely
that
the
commission
would
pick
up
the
ball
and
carry
it
itself
and
bring
the
suit
with
the
medical
committee
perhaps
as
a
party.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
in
light
of
that
section
25
provides
that
the
commission
“in
its
discretion”
may
bring
a
suit
to
enforce
the
statute
or
the
regulations.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
all
i
am
saying
is
i
do
not
think
that
the
commission
is
under
any
obligation
to
bring
such
a
suit
if
in
it
its
discretion,
it
thinks,
it
should
not.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
remedy
would
be
to
bring
a
suit
in
the
united
states
for
the
medical
committee,
to
bring
a
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
to
require
--
not
against
the
commission,
nor
against
dow.
to
require
dow
to
comply
with
(a)
the
state
law
and
(b)
with
the
proxy.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
you
change,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
is
no
statutory
duty,
there
is
a
duty
to
exercise
its
discretion,
there
is
not
a
slightest
doubt
that
it
did
exercise
this
discretion
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
would
be
another
case
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
commission
refused
to
do
anything,
that
would
be
an
extraordinarily
negative
order,
i
suppose.
but
it
might
be,
might
conceivably
be
subject
to
review,
as
an
utter
abusive
discretion.
but
no
suggestion
here
that
anything
of
that
sort
occurs.
if
all
questions
under
the
proxy
rules
are
subject
to
review
by
the
courts,
then
they
must
be
handled
differently,
as
i
have
already
said,
they
are
very
numerous.
if
they
are
subject
to
review,
there
must
be
a
thorough
record,
there
must
be
reasoned
opinions,
there
must
be
a
clearer
opportunity
for
the
intra-commission
review
for
all
of
which
there
is
no
time.
i
think,
it
was
emerson
who
said
that,
the
central
tragedy
of
life
is
that
there
are
only
24
hours
in
a
day.
congress
may
well
have
thought
it
better
for
the
whole
matter
to
be
handled
by
the
administrative
process
without
a
judicial
review.
and
support
for
this
is
found
in
other
provisions
of
the
statute.
the
allocation
of
the
area
to
the
commission
in
14a,
it
is
found
in
the
fact
that
congress
made
no
provisions
for
any
order
by
the
commission
in
the
area.
and
it
is
found
finally
that
it
expressly
allocated
the
enforcement
of
these
provisions
to
the
commission
in
its
discretion.
there
is
no
provision
that
this
essentially
administrative
determination
shall
be
made
by
the
courts
or
even
that
the
court
shall
have
power
to
review
the
commission’s
action
or
inaction,
unless
it
shall
appear
to
the
commission
that
there
is
about
to
be
a
violation
and
the
commission
in
its
discretion
brings
an
action
in
the
proper
court.
we
think
that
this
comes
well
within
the
language
which
the
court
used
in
the
case
of
schilling
v.
rogers
in
363
us
cited
on
pages
39
and
40
of
our
brief.
there
are
many
reasons
why
the
commission
might
conclude
that
it
would
take
no
action
and
not
every
case
taken
to
a
court
will
be
decided
by
that
court
as
is
evident
in
this
court’s
certiorari
jurisdiction.
another
analogy
that
naturally
occurred
to
me
is
that
not
every
case
can
be
taken
to
a
court,
even
though
there
maybe
a
basis
for
thinking
that
the
decision
is
wrong
and
that
there
should
review
as
is
evident
in
the
function
of
the
solicitor
general
to
decide
what
cases
to
appeal
and
what
cases
to
bring
to
this
court
on
petition
for
certiorari.
these
are
discretionary
functions
and
it
would
be
hard
to
give
a
consistently
reasoned
justification
for
every
decision
which
frequently
turns
on
other
considerations
than
the
merits
of
the
case.
and
there
would
not
be
time
to
give
such
reasons,
if
for
some
reasons
it
was
thought
that
it
had
to
be
done.
all
of
this,
it
seems
to
me
is
nicely
exemplified
in
the
present
case.
the
court
of
appeals
was
not
in
a
position
to
vindicate
any
right
of
the
medical
committee
that
can
be
done
only
in
a
district
court
in
an
action
to
enforce
compliance
with
the
proxy
rules.
the
court
of
appeals
cannot
order
the
commission
to
seek
enforcement.
there
is
no
provision
for
such
a
mandatory
order
in
section
25a
and
the
decision
to
seek
enforcement
has
been
expressly
committed
by
congress
to
the
discretion
of
the
commission.
all
that
the
court
of
appeals
can
do
in
this
case
is
to
express
its
view
of
the
law
applicable
to
a
controversy
between
the
medical
committee
and
dow,
that
not
has
not
been
presented
by
those
parties
for
the
court's
consideration
and
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
will
not
be
binding
on
the
district
court,
if
the
medical
committee
seeks
to
enforce
there,
its
rights
as
a
shareholder.
if
for
no
other
reason,
then
the
dow
is
not
a
party
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
is
not
in
anyway
bound
by
its
decision.
thus
the
present
procedural
posture
of
the
case
shows
clearly
enough
that
the
only
end
to
which
it
can
come
is
an
advisory
opinion
by
the
court
below
on
a
matter
as
to
which
the
court
can
require
no
action
to
be
taken
and
which
is
one
that
congress
has
expressly
allocated
for
good
reason
for
handling
by
the
administrative
process
and
not
by
the
courts,
the
judgment
should
be
reversed.
