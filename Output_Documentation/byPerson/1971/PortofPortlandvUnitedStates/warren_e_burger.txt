we

port
of
portland
against
the
united

mr.
tatum,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
you
pinpoint
for
me
where
that
connection
would
be
on
your
plot
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
would
they
connect
on
the
markings
which
are
already
shown
here
by
the
yellow
or
does
that
come
out
with
the
green
line
which
is
burlington
northern,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
is
there
a
line
on
here
which
shows
the
actual
connection
or
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
saying
that
they
are
now
giving
effect
to
agreements
that
pre-dated
the
final
burlington
northern
lines
merger
agreement?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
kahn.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
does
that
have
very
much
to
do
with
ot
when
we
are
talking
about
strategic
location
mr.
kahn?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
assume
now
you
are
trying
to
get
this
to
a
point
(inaudible),
but
how
this
relates
to
whether
it
should
be
owned
in
a
limited
way
or
a
broad
way.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you
are
saying
is
they
are
getting
exercised
over
nothing
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
was
that
a
finding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
means
are
you
saying
that
they
must
apply
to
the
icc
just
as
so
they
were
strangers
in
the
same
way
as
the
southern
pacific
and
milwaukee?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
they
would
appear
to
be
exercised
over
nothing.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
this
is
the
law
of
the
situation,
the
legal
posture
of
these
parties
by
that
they
need
any
agreement
about
neutrality,
if
the
statute
requires
them
to
give
the
same
service
to
strangers
as
to
their
corporate
parents?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
did
not
satisfy
your
opinion.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
details
of
the
northern
lines
merger
are
certainly
not
(inaudible)
right
now,
but
milwaukee
of
course
was
under
appellate
(ph)
was
very
much
concerned
about
the
great
manufacturers
including
things
just
like
this.
their
oppositions
finally,
as
i
recall,
drawn
away
by
the
conditions
including
particularly
condition
24.
is
this
not
generally
within
the
reach
of
the
time
or
the
thing
that
was
contemplated
to
reassure
milwaukee?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
would
be
bad
about
--
what
are
the
negatives
on
or
ownership
as
against
to
--
just
from
the
public
interest
standpoint,
forget
about
the
parties?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
when
you
say
congestion,
do
you
mean
that
the
corporate
owners
are
going
to
get
preference?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
tatum
you
have
five
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
may
i
inquire,
how
long
the
case
was
before
those
three
judges,
how
much
time
did
you
spend
actually
in
the
hearing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
they
are
still
as
available
as
they
ever
were?
