mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
the
court
upon
appeal
from
a
three-judge
court
of
the
district
of
oregon,
affirming
a
division
of
interstate
commerce
commission.
jurisdiction
of
this
court
is
conferred
by
28
u.s.c.
1253.
this
case
arose
when
two
of
the
four
railroads
serving
portland
filed
an
application
with
the
commission
for
authority
to
acquire
control
of
peninsula
terminal
company
under
section
5
(2)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
the
two
acquiring
railroads
were
union
pacific
and
spokane,
portland
&
seattle
railway.
the
latter,
sp&s,
at
the
time
of
the
application
was
a
subsidiary
of
great
northern
and
northern
pacific.
it
is
now
a
part
of
the
burlington
northern
system
under
the
approval
granted
by
this
court
in
the
northern
lines
merger.
i
shall
hereafter
refer
to
them
as
burlington
northern.
in
their
application,
the
acquiring
railroads
stated
that
it
was
anticipated
that
within
the
foreseeable
future
substantial
new
traffic
and
revenues
would
be
derived
from
peninsula
terminal
as
a
result
of
the
development
of
the
rivergate
industrial
track
by
the
port
of
portland.
it
is
thus
substantial
new
traffic
and
revenues
which
will
be
generated
by
rivergate
that
is
prompted
the
great
interest
in
this
case.
rivergate
is
the
key
to
the
public
interest
here.
it
is
an
area
of
approximately
3,000
acres
located
at
the
confluence
of
the
willamette
and
columbia
rivers.
we
have
a
--
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
that
is
a
more
--
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
that
is
a
much
more
detailed
map
your
honor.
if
you
would
refer
to
the
schematic
which
we
have
appended
to
the
end
of
our
brief,
i
think
it
will
be
simpler
to
follow
than
that
complicated
map,
which
you
have
before
you.
at
the
end
of
our
brief
there
is
a
simple
schematic.
yes
sir.
rivergate
is
marked
on
this
at
the
confluence
of
the
willamette
and
columbia
rivers.
it
is
owned
and
it
is
being
developed
by
the
port
of
portland
for
whom
i
am
general
counsel.
i
am
also
appearing
today
for
the
milwaukee
and
southern
pacific
as
who
are
joint
appellants
and
for
the
oregon
public
utility
commissioner.
a
great
amount
of
time
and
money
has
been
invested
by
the
port
authority
in
planning
this
modern,
attractive,
industrial
and
port
complex
to
provide
for
the
future
economic
development
of
the
area.
here
is
where
all
modes
of
transportation
will
meet
to
provide
efficient
and
economical
interchange
of
goods.
the
port
has
already
invested
more
than
$5
million
of
public
fund,
and
it
estimates
that
will
expend
a
minimum
of
$15
million
in
the
full
development
of
rivergate.
a
conservative
estimate
in
the
record
of
the
public
and
private
investment
in
this
area
exceeds
$500
million.
with
further
evidence
which
is
undisputed
is
that
rivergate
at
full
development
will
require
the
handling
of
some
500-600
railroad
cars
per
day.
in
order
to
orient
the
court
with
various
railroads
involved
here,
i
would
refer
again
to
our
schematic
which
is
appended
to
our
brief.
the
peninsula
terminal
company,
the
railroad
in
question
here,
is
marked
in
yellow
at
the
upper
northern
end,
just
south
of
the
columbia
river.
the
record
shows
it
is
a
railroad
of
sum
3.79
miles.
its
importance
is
not
its
size
but
its
strategic
location
as
a
gateway
to
rivergate.
to
the
south
and
west,
there
is
another
rivergate
entrance
which
is
shown
as
number
9
on
our
schematic.
there
is
a
small
mark
in
the
one
corner
of
north.
north
is
at
the
top
of
the
page,
your
honor.
number
9
is
barnes
yard
which
is
owned
by
the
union
pacific,
that
burlington
northern
has
an
agreement
for
use
of
that
yard
and
access
to
rivergate
over
the
track
shown
in
red.
where
the
track
enters
rivergate,
as
it
is
shown
in
blue,
the
track
has
been
built
and
is
owned
by
the
port.
the
record
also
shows
that
the
railroad
pattern
in
rivergate
will
essentially
be
a
loop
system
around
the
periphery
of
the
entire
district,
with
one
outlet
through
the
south
in
barnes
yard
which
now
shows
in
red,
and
the
other
through
the
northern
outlet
which
is
where
the
peninsula
terminal
company
acquires
its
importance.
to
achieve
with
rivergate’s
goal,
it
is
necessary
that
--
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
yes
sir,
excuse
me.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
peninsula
terminal
is
marked
yellow.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
i
have
discussed
the
milwaukee’s
entry
to
portland
sir
but
they
come
down
the
green
line
which
is
the
burlington
northern
main
line
into
portland.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
and
go
right
by
rivergate.
go
right
by
this
yellow
line
and
the
red
line.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
yes
sir.
and
i
come
into
hoyt
yard
which
is
mark
number
3
on
the
map
down
in
the
lower
right
hand
corner.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
to
achieve
rivergate’s
goal,
it
is
necessary
that
all
modes
of
transportation
be
afforded
the
most
modern
methods
of
bringing
goods
to
and
from
the
district.
all
shipping
lines
that
serve
portland
may
bring
their
vessels
to
rivergate’s
docks.
all
truck
lines
that
serve
portland
may
bring
their
vehicles
to
their
customer’s
doors
in
rivergate.
so,
also
it
is
our
contention
that
the
public
interest
requires
that
all
four
line-haul
railroads
serving
portland
must
also
have
direct
access
to
rivergate
shippers
and
receivers.
accordingly
when
union
pacific
--
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
at
point
e,
your
honor.
point
e,
which
is
described
as
a
testimony
of
crown
zellerbach
poleyard
just
south
of
what
is
marked
hayden
island,
is
actually
in
rivergate
and
the
track
will
take
off
form
there
in
a
loop
system.
there
is
some
discussion
in
the
record
about
another
potential
access
which
i
will
cover
later
in
my
remarks.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
yes
sir.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
there
are
three
lines,
the
red
one,
the
green
one
and
the
yellow
one,
which
indicate
the
interchange
between
union
pacific,
burlington
northern
and
peninsula
terminal.
there
is
considerable
controversy
in
the
case
of
whether
or
not
mere
equal
ownership
of
peninsula
would
permit
southern
pacific
or
milwaukee
actually
to
get
to
peninsula.
so
to
be
very
careful,
both
counsel
for
both
of
those
lines
filed
applications
under
section
3
(5).
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
no
sir,
the
possession
has
been
taken
they
have
no
rights
on
the
jointly
owned
tracks
--
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
--
which
are
those
three
different
colors
there.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
they
therefore
have
no
right
to
use
those
anymore
than
--
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
well
--
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
i
think
in
attempting
to
make
our
schematic
simple,
we
may
have
misled.
these
lines
that
you
see
marked
in
the
different
colors
up
there
by
peninsula
are
actually
all
the
joint
ownership
line.
they
are
owned
jointly
by
burlington
northern,
union
pacific
and
peninsula
or
combinations
of
them.
so
that
under
the
language
of
condition
24
of
the
northern
lines
which
starts
out
to
the
extent
that
the
new
company
is
unable
to
do
so,
they
will
grant
trackage.
they
now
take
the
possession
that
because
union
pacific
is
a
partner
in
this,
burlington
northern
does
not
have
the
right
under
condition
24
of
the
northern
lines
to
grant
them
access.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
yes,
they
can
go
over
it,
your
honor.
but
the
testimony
is
that
in
order
to
get
a
car
form
milwaukee
to
peninsula,
they
will
have
to
bring
that
car
into
point
3
and
then
turn
it
over
to
burlington
northern
to
switch
it
back
to
peninsula
terminal.
this
is
one
of
the
real
arguments
in
this
case.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
well
--
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
our
opponent
says,
it
does
not
make
any
difference.
i
shall
not
continue
further
with
the
discussion
of
how
the
case
got
here.
i
think
the
court
is
informed
of
the
facts
of
how
we
are
here.
when
we
went
into
the
district
court
with
the
complaint
by
the
port
and
the
public
utility
commissioner,
the
southern
pacific
and
milwaukee
joined
us.
the
united
states
as
nominal
defendant
filed
the
brief
in
support,
saying
the
case
should
be
remanded.
in
this
case
the
united
states
has
likewise
filed
a
brief
in
support
of
remand.
let
us
turn
to
the
milwaukee
ownership
which
we
discussed
under
the
northern
lines
case.
we
contend
that
by
refusing
milwaukee
a
part
ownership
in
the
peninsula
terminal,
the
commission
has
turned
its
back
on
what
it
said
in
approving
the
northern
lines
merger.
namely
that
competition
loss
between
great
northern
and
northern
pacific
would
be
substantially
offset
by
a
greatly
enhanced
competition
from
milwaukee.
and
here
in
the
very
first
time,
this
comes
up
in
the
very
first
context
as
they
come
into
portland,
they
are
told
you
have
to
go
right
by
in
(inaudible)
hoyt
yard
and
come
back.
the
entire
purpose
of
condition
24,
as
i
read
it
in
the
commission’s
decision
and
in
this
court’s
decision,
was
to
permit
milwaukee
to
become
a
line-haul
competitive
carrier
with
the
new
burlington
northern
replacing
the
northern
pacific
and
great
northern.
this
was
going
on
at
exactly
the
same
time
as
the
commission
was
handling
the
great
northern
merger
case.
in
fact,
we
contend,
and
it
is
set
forth
in
very
brief
summary
in
the
justice
department's
brief
on
page
14,
that
this
agreement
and
this
acquisition
of
peninsula
terminal
may
well
have
been
done
to
thwart
what
was
coming
in
condition
24
of
the
northern
lines
agreement.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
yes
sir.
it
assures
them
a
trackage
lines
from
8
--
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
yes
sir.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
no,
there
are
some
joint
uses,
but
it
is
not
jointly
owned.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
no,
some
of
those
three
turnouts
that
we
have
by
peninsula
terminal,
all
of
them
are
jointly
owned,
and
it
is
because
of
that
joint
ownership
that
they
say
they
can
keep
it
up.
let
me
point
out
that
down
at
point
9,
which
is
barnes
yard
which
is
a
union
pacific
facility,
in
may
of
1967,
exhibit
39
which
is
in
the
appendix
at
page
303,
a
contract
was
entered
into
between
union
pacific
and
burlington
northern.
by
virtue
of
that
contract,
union
pacific
permitted
burlington
northern
to
get
into
rivergate
through
the
south
entrance
through
point
9,
but
in
that
they
agreed
that
they
would
let
no
one
else
in
unless
they
had
the
approval
of
the
other
party.
so
they
have
effectively
foreclosed
milwaukee
at
that
point.
as
a
further
provision
in
that
agreement,
they
said
if
there
was
ever
a
new
line
which
pulls
off
of
the
burlington
northern
main
line
and
goes
into
rivergate
at
the
northern
end
forgetting
about
peninsula,
if
there
is
a
new
line
that
goes
in
there,
that
too
will
be
subject
to
the
same
terms.
it
will
be
only
bn
and
up
and
no
one
else
can
be
admitted
without
their
concurrence.
that
was
--
the
peninsula
contract
was
signed
in
february
1967.
this
agreement
i
have
just
referred
to,
exhibit
39,
was
signed
in
may,
1967.
in
july,
1967,
they
filed
the
petition
for
acquisition
which
is
now
before
the
court
and
in
november,
1967,
condition
24
was
imposed
in
the
northern
lines
--
by
the
icc.
and
certainly
it
is
apparent
to
us
that
this
was
well
in
the
mind
of
all
of
the
parties
at
the
time
the
transaction
was
being
taken
up
with
peninsula
terminal.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
yes
sir,
and
the
condition,
as
i
said
earlier,
starts
out
with
the
parenthetical
statement
to
the
extent
that
burlington
northern
or
newco
is
permitted
to
do
so,
it
shall
permit
milwaukee
in,
and
yet
their
hands
in
portland
have
been
effectively
tied
certainly
as
far
as
this
great
public
industrial
development
at
rivergate
is
concerned
by
the
restrictive
agreements
that
they
have
entered
into,
and
we
contend
that
therefore
milwaukee
in
this
acquisition
case
should
be
granted
the
right
to
control
peninsula
or
have
a
share
in
the
control
of
peninsula
and
also
should
have
a
right
to
get
trackage
rights
to
get
in
there
under
the
northern
lines
decision.
we
also
feel
that
the
public
interest
requires
southern
pacific
to
get
in
there
so
that
all
four
major
line-haul
carriers
will
be
able
to
serve
portland.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
we
feel
that
cases
that
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
and
which
justices
cited
in
theirs,
that
similar
kind
of
port
developments
have
been
granted
equal
access
by
all
of
the
line-haul
carriers
in
there.
the
calumet
port
case
was
one
which
comes
to
my
mind
immediately
that
was
cited.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
that
is
the
circumstance
that
we
do
not
have,
and
therefore
i
do
not
know.
this
is
not
a
railroad
development;
this
is
a
public
development.
the
railroads
just
happened
to
go
by
at
the
time
and
it
is
only
through
the
confusion
of
public
money
that
this
low-lying
land
is
being
able
to
be
developed
into
this
excellent
port
and
industrial
facilities,
so
therefore
it
belongs
to
no
railroad.
this
is
one
of
the
points
that
the
commission
got
off
on
as
deciding
that
this
was
an
invasion
of
union
pacific
in
burlington
northern’s
territory.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
it
was
just
getting
underway
your
honor;
that
is
correct.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
i
do
not
know
whether
it
would
have
been
taken
into
consideration
in
the
northern
lines
case,
but
i
think
had
the
peninsula
terminal
acquisition
come
up
four
or
five
years
after
the
northern
lines
had
been
implemented,
the
commission
would
have
taken
more
cognizance
of
rivergate
and
its
importance
than
it
did
in
its
decision.
it
is
one
of
our
contentions
that
all
the
commission
did
was
concentrate
on
this
little
3.79
mile
railroad
with
a
declining
number
of
cars.
i
think
only
2700
in
1967
the
evidence
here
of
which
southern
pacific
had
about
17%
and
milwaukee
had
about
1%
and
the
icc
said
or
the
commission
said,
well
such
a
little
railroad
is
this
and
such
a
small
amount
of
traffic,
let
us
not
worry
about
this
industrial
development,
and
in
so
doing
cut
milwaukee
out
of
the
single
biggest
industrial
area
that
possibly
could
be
in
portland.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
well
--
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
yes
sir.
it
is
not
only
its
access
but
joint
ownership
enables
them
to
participate
in
routes
and
divisions
and
rates
which
they
could
not
do
it.
they
merely
have
to
have
--
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
yes
sir,
but
this
is
a
peculiar
hybrid
type
of
railroad
and
--
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
yes
sir.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
yes
sir.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
they
can
switch
--
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
well,
they
can
go
to
barnes
--
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
they
can
go
to
hoyt
yard
and
switch
back
to
peninsula
and
absorb
the
switching
charge
and
lose
a
day
as
advantage
over
the
other.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
no,
i
will
try
to
address
myself
to
that.
the
peninsula
terminal
company
as
the
record
shows
does
not
get
its
money
by
a
switching
charge.
there
is
a
switching
charge
from
point
3
to
point
--
to
peninsula
road
that
is
the
switching
charge.
but
when
it
gets
to
peninsula
then
it
is
a
division
rate
which
is
a
negotiated
rate.
now
there
is
a
lot
of
confusion
in
this
in
the
commission’s
brief.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
no
sir,
no
sir.
we
cite
case
to
you
your
honor,
the
l&n
railroad
company
against
the
united
states
242
u.s.
69.
we
are
told
that
a
railroad
in
this
situation
does
not
have
to
treat
others
on
the
same
basis
as
they
treat
their
owners.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
yes
sir.
and
also
joint
ownership
will
permit
every
industry
that
locates
in
rivergate
and
is
served
by
milwaukee
to
be
an
online
milwaukee
industry
if
there
is
joint
ownership.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
but
they
are
then
entitled
to
publish
their
true
rates,
they
issue
the
billing,
it
is
handled
as
if
it
is
their
own
car,
and
it
is
getting
into
different
parts
of
my
argument.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
that
is
alright
your
honor.
it
will
be
single
carrier
routing.
it
will
be
improved
terminal
service
if
they
are
part
of
the
owner.
common
ownership
assures
the
use
of
modern
railroad
technology
and
there
will
be
rate
benefits
by
them
all
three
being
common
owners.
i
should
also
like
to
comment
on
the
strange
procedure
that
burlington
northern
and
union
pacific
adopted
in
this
case.
in
their
brief
which
is
field
to
this
court,
they
made
a
settlement
offer
to
milwaukee
which
is
in
the
extremely
strange
place
in
the
proceeding
to
try
to
make
the
settlement
offer.
we
contend
that
it
is
a
last
minute
recognition
of
the
fact
that
the
commission
was
wrong,
when
it
decided
there
would
be
no
detriment
to
the
public.
this
offer
really
does
not
give
milwaukee
anything
other
than
the
saving
of
an
unnecessary
switch
charge
--
this
goes
to
mr.
justice
white’s
question
--
to
deliver
cars
to
peninsula
and
possibly
a
savings
in
time.
however,
burlington
northern
and
union
pacific,
under
the
offer
they
made,
will
still
control
peninsula.
they
can
control
its
development
as
well
as
the
development
of
rivergate.
they
have
still
been
able
to
insert
themselves
between
milwaukee
and
rivergate
by
this
controlled
company.
we
think
that
this
recognition
of
--
their
own
recognition
certainly
demands
that
it
be
remanded.
i
spoke
in
a
great
deal
about
milwaukee
in
this
argument
because
they
are
in
a
slightly
different
factual
situation
because
of
the
northern
lines
merger
case.
but
we
feel
the
public
interest
equally
require
southern
pacific
to
have
access
to
this
industrial
area.
same
benefits
of
single
routing,
improved
terminal
service,
modern
technology
and
rate
benefits
would
apply
if
the
southern
pacific
was
equally
there.
the
testimony
in
this
case
is
that
there
is
an
upholding
over
30-hour
delay
in
delivering
a
southern
pacific
car
from
point
6
to
point
7.
it
takes
them
over
30
hours
to
traverse
that
5.2
miles.
obviously
that
traffic
is
not
being
handled
as
expeditiously
as
it
can
even
on
this
little
small
volume
that
the
peninsula
terminal
carries
now.
how
can
they
possibly
handle
500-600
cars
a
day
with
delays
like
that?
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
just
very
briefly
answer
a
few
comments.
i
referred
the
court
to
take
the
time
we
have
allotted
to
our
brief
and
the
justice
department
brief
which
points
out
what
the
commission
did
and
did
not
find
as
contrasted
to
what
have
the
commission
now
argues
before
this
court.
they
have
made
no
findings
similar
to
what
is
being
argued
here
today
and
i
commend
our
briefs
to
you
on
that
point.
counsel
has
made
much
in
his
brief
and
much
in
his
argument
of
matters
that
are
entirely
outside
the
record
in
this
case.
he
spends
a
great
deal
of
time
in
his
brief
and
in
his
argument
on
the
reciprocal
switching
arrangement
which
was
not
entered
into
at
all,
before
this
case
was
decided
and
on
its
way
up
here.
so
how
can
the
commission
have
taken
into
account
the
reciprocal
switching
arrangement
when
it
was
not
even
entered
into.
i
am
also
advised
by
a
counsel
for
milwaukee
that
my
statement
that
i
made
on
peninsula
and
insisting
upon
the
division
rates
is
absolutely
accurate.
and
it
has
had
great
deal
of
difficulty
in
publishing
these
rates
upon
its
entry
to
portland
that
is
outside
the
record.
but
we
have
been
arguing
outside
the
record
as
counsel
has
begun.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
yes
sir
there
was.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
none
that
i
know
of
sir.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
we
must
spend
a
couple
of
hours
your
honor.
we
were
each
granted
a
half
an
hour
and
i
took
my
full
time
and
mr.
shapiro
of
the
department
of
justice
was
granted
about
the
same
time.
the
commission
and
union
pacific
each
presented
arguments
and
we
all
ran
over
our
allotted
30
minutes,
i
think
we
must
have
spent
close
to
two
hours
in
arguing.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
no
sir.
i
have
practiced
before
that
court
your
honor.[laughter]
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum

that
case.
he

mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
yes
sir,
yes
sir,
they
are
still
in
court.
our
real
summary
of
this
case
your
honor,
gentlemen,
is
that
the
real
issue
in
this
case
is
not
the
right
of
the
railroads
to
serve.
the
real
issue,
as
we
see
it,
is
the
right
of
the
public
to
be
served
in
this
great
rivergate
area.
thank
you.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
the
court
upon
appeal
from
a
three-judge
court
of
the
district
of
oregon,
affirming
a
division
of
interstate
commerce
commission.
jurisdiction
of
this
court
is
conferred
by
28
u.s.c.
1253.
this
case
arose
when
two
of
the
four
railroads
serving
portland
filed
an
application
with
the
commission
for
authority
to
acquire
control
of
peninsula
terminal
company
under
section
5
(2)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
the
two
acquiring
railroads
were
union
pacific
and
spokane,
portland
&
seattle
railway.
the
latter,
sp&s,
at
the
time
of
the
application
was
a
subsidiary
of
great
northern
and
northern
pacific.
it
is
now
a
part
of
the
burlington
northern
system
under
the
approval
granted
by
this
court
in
the
northern
lines
merger.
i
shall
hereafter
refer
to
them
as
burlington
northern.
in
their
application,
the
acquiring
railroads
stated
that
it
was
anticipated
that
within
the
foreseeable
future
substantial
new
traffic
and
revenues
would
be
derived
from
peninsula
terminal
as
a
result
of
the
development
of
the
rivergate
industrial
track
by
the
port
of
portland.
it
is
thus
substantial
new
traffic
and
revenues
which
will
be
generated
by
rivergate
that
is
prompted
the
great
interest
in
this
case.
rivergate
is
the
key
to
the
public
interest
here.
it
is
an
area
of
approximately
3,000
acres
located
at
the
confluence
of
the
willamette
and
columbia
rivers.
we
have
a
--
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
that
is
a
more
--
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
that
is
a
much
more
detailed
map
your
honor.
if
you
would
refer
to
the
schematic
which
we
have
appended
to
the
end
of
our
brief,
i
think
it
will
be
simpler
to
follow
than
that
complicated
map,
which
you
have
before
you.
at
the
end
of
our
brief
there
is
a
simple
schematic.
yes
sir.
rivergate
is
marked
on
this
at
the
confluence
of
the
willamette
and
columbia
rivers.
it
is
owned
and
it
is
being
developed
by
the
port
of
portland
for
whom
i
am
general
counsel.
i
am
also
appearing
today
for
the
milwaukee
and
southern
pacific
as
who
are
joint
appellants
and
for
the
oregon
public
utility
commissioner.
a
great
amount
of
time
and
money
has
been
invested
by
the
port
authority
in
planning
this
modern,
attractive,
industrial
and
port
complex
to
provide
for
the
future
economic
development
of
the
area.
here
is
where
all
modes
of
transportation
will
meet
to
provide
efficient
and
economical
interchange
of
goods.
the
port
has
already
invested
more
than
$5
million
of
public
fund,
and
it
estimates
that
will
expend
a
minimum
of
$15
million
in
the
full
development
of
rivergate.
a
conservative
estimate
in
the
record
of
the
public
and
private
investment
in
this
area
exceeds
$500
million.
with
further
evidence
which
is
undisputed
is
that
rivergate
at
full
development
will
require
the
handling
of
some
500-600
railroad
cars
per
day.
in
order
to
orient
the
court
with
various
railroads
involved
here,
i
would
refer
again
to
our
schematic
which
is
appended
to
our
brief.
the
peninsula
terminal
company,
the
railroad
in
question
here,
is
marked
in
yellow
at
the
upper
northern
end,
just
south
of
the
columbia
river.
the
record
shows
it
is
a
railroad
of
sum
3.79
miles.
its
importance
is
not
its
size
but
its
strategic
location
as
a
gateway
to
rivergate.
to
the
south
and
west,
there
is
another
rivergate
entrance
which
is
shown
as
number
9
on
our
schematic.
there
is
a
small
mark
in
the
one
corner
of
north.
north
is
at
the
top
of
the
page,
your
honor.
number
9
is
barnes
yard
which
is
owned
by
the
union
pacific,
that
burlington
northern
has
an
agreement
for
use
of
that
yard
and
access
to
rivergate
over
the
track
shown
in
red.
where
the
track
enters
rivergate,
as
it
is
shown
in
blue,
the
track
has
been
built
and
is
owned
by
the
port.
the
record
also
shows
that
the
railroad
pattern
in
rivergate
will
essentially
be
a
loop
system
around
the
periphery
of
the
entire
district,
with
one
outlet
through
the
south
in
barnes
yard
which
now
shows
in
red,
and
the
other
through
the
northern
outlet
which
is
where
the
peninsula
terminal
company
acquires
its
importance.
to
achieve
with
rivergate’s
goal,
it
is
necessary
that
--
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
yes
sir,
excuse
me.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
peninsula
terminal
is
marked
yellow.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
i
have
discussed
the
milwaukee’s
entry
to
portland
sir
but
they
come
down
the
green
line
which
is
the
burlington
northern
main
line
into
portland.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
and
go
right
by
rivergate.
go
right
by
this
yellow
line
and
the
red
line.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
yes
sir.
and
i
come
into
hoyt
yard
which
is
mark
number
3
on
the
map
down
in
the
lower
right
hand
corner.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
to
achieve
rivergate’s
goal,
it
is
necessary
that
all
modes
of
transportation
be
afforded
the
most
modern
methods
of
bringing
goods
to
and
from
the
district.
all
shipping
lines
that
serve
portland
may
bring
their
vessels
to
rivergate’s
docks.
all
truck
lines
that
serve
portland
may
bring
their
vehicles
to
their
customer’s
doors
in
rivergate.
so,
also
it
is
our
contention
that
the
public
interest
requires
that
all
four
line-haul
railroads
serving
portland
must
also
have
direct
access
to
rivergate
shippers
and
receivers.
accordingly
when
union
pacific
--
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
at
point
e,
your
honor.
point
e,
which
is
described
as
a
testimony
of
crown
zellerbach
poleyard
just
south
of
what
is
marked
hayden
island,
is
actually
in
rivergate
and
the
track
will
take
off
form
there
in
a
loop
system.
there
is
some
discussion
in
the
record
about
another
potential
access
which
i
will
cover
later
in
my
remarks.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
yes
sir.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
there
are
three
lines,
the
red
one,
the
green
one
and
the
yellow
one,
which
indicate
the
interchange
between
union
pacific,
burlington
northern
and
peninsula
terminal.
there
is
considerable
controversy
in
the
case
of
whether
or
not
mere
equal
ownership
of
peninsula
would
permit
southern
pacific
or
milwaukee
actually
to
get
to
peninsula.
so
to
be
very
careful,
both
counsel
for
both
of
those
lines
filed
applications
under
section
3
(5).
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
no
sir,
the
possession
has
been
taken
they
have
no
rights
on
the
jointly
owned
tracks
--
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
--
which
are
those
three
different
colors
there.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
they
therefore
have
no
right
to
use
those
anymore
than
--
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
well
--
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
i
think
in
attempting
to
make
our
schematic
simple,
we
may
have
misled.
these
lines
that
you
see
marked
in
the
different
colors
up
there
by
peninsula
are
actually
all
the
joint
ownership
line.
they
are
owned
jointly
by
burlington
northern,
union
pacific
and
peninsula
or
combinations
of
them.
so
that
under
the
language
of
condition
24
of
the
northern
lines
which
starts
out
to
the
extent
that
the
new
company
is
unable
to
do
so,
they
will
grant
trackage.
they
now
take
the
possession
that
because
union
pacific
is
a
partner
in
this,
burlington
northern
does
not
have
the
right
under
condition
24
of
the
northern
lines
to
grant
them
access.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
yes,
they
can
go
over
it,
your
honor.
but
the
testimony
is
that
in
order
to
get
a
car
form
milwaukee
to
peninsula,
they
will
have
to
bring
that
car
into
point
3
and
then
turn
it
over
to
burlington
northern
to
switch
it
back
to
peninsula
terminal.
this
is
one
of
the
real
arguments
in
this
case.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
well
--
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
our
opponent
says,
it
does
not
make
any
difference.
i
shall
not
continue
further
with
the
discussion
of
how
the
case
got
here.
i
think
the
court
is
informed
of
the
facts
of
how
we
are
here.
when
we
went
into
the
district
court
with
the
complaint
by
the
port
and
the
public
utility
commissioner,
the
southern
pacific
and
milwaukee
joined
us.
the
united
states
as
nominal
defendant
filed
the
brief
in
support,
saying
the
case
should
be
remanded.
in
this
case
the
united
states
has
likewise
filed
a
brief
in
support
of
remand.
let
us
turn
to
the
milwaukee
ownership
which
we
discussed
under
the
northern
lines
case.
we
contend
that
by
refusing
milwaukee
a
part
ownership
in
the
peninsula
terminal,
the
commission
has
turned
its
back
on
what
it
said
in
approving
the
northern
lines
merger.
namely
that
competition
loss
between
great
northern
and
northern
pacific
would
be
substantially
offset
by
a
greatly
enhanced
competition
from
milwaukee.
and
here
in
the
very
first
time,
this
comes
up
in
the
very
first
context
as
they
come
into
portland,
they
are
told
you
have
to
go
right
by
in
(inaudible)
hoyt
yard
and
come
back.
the
entire
purpose
of
condition
24,
as
i
read
it
in
the
commission’s
decision
and
in
this
court’s
decision,
was
to
permit
milwaukee
to
become
a
line-haul
competitive
carrier
with
the
new
burlington
northern
replacing
the
northern
pacific
and
great
northern.
this
was
going
on
at
exactly
the
same
time
as
the
commission
was
handling
the
great
northern
merger
case.
in
fact,
we
contend,
and
it
is
set
forth
in
very
brief
summary
in
the
justice
department's
brief
on
page
14,
that
this
agreement
and
this
acquisition
of
peninsula
terminal
may
well
have
been
done
to
thwart
what
was
coming
in
condition
24
of
the
northern
lines
agreement.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
yes
sir.
it
assures
them
a
trackage
lines
from
8
--
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
yes
sir.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
no,
there
are
some
joint
uses,
but
it
is
not
jointly
owned.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
no,
some
of
those
three
turnouts
that
we
have
by
peninsula
terminal,
all
of
them
are
jointly
owned,
and
it
is
because
of
that
joint
ownership
that
they
say
they
can
keep
it
up.
let
me
point
out
that
down
at
point
9,
which
is
barnes
yard
which
is
a
union
pacific
facility,
in
may
of
1967,
exhibit
39
which
is
in
the
appendix
at
page
303,
a
contract
was
entered
into
between
union
pacific
and
burlington
northern.
by
virtue
of
that
contract,
union
pacific
permitted
burlington
northern
to
get
into
rivergate
through
the
south
entrance
through
point
9,
but
in
that
they
agreed
that
they
would
let
no
one
else
in
unless
they
had
the
approval
of
the
other
party.
so
they
have
effectively
foreclosed
milwaukee
at
that
point.
as
a
further
provision
in
that
agreement,
they
said
if
there
was
ever
a
new
line
which
pulls
off
of
the
burlington
northern
main
line
and
goes
into
rivergate
at
the
northern
end
forgetting
about
peninsula,
if
there
is
a
new
line
that
goes
in
there,
that
too
will
be
subject
to
the
same
terms.
it
will
be
only
bn
and
up
and
no
one
else
can
be
admitted
without
their
concurrence.
that
was
--
the
peninsula
contract
was
signed
in
february
1967.
this
agreement
i
have
just
referred
to,
exhibit
39,
was
signed
in
may,
1967.
in
july,
1967,
they
filed
the
petition
for
acquisition
which
is
now
before
the
court
and
in
november,
1967,
condition
24
was
imposed
in
the
northern
lines
--
by
the
icc.
and
certainly
it
is
apparent
to
us
that
this
was
well
in
the
mind
of
all
of
the
parties
at
the
time
the
transaction
was
being
taken
up
with
peninsula
terminal.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
yes
sir,
and
the
condition,
as
i
said
earlier,
starts
out
with
the
parenthetical
statement
to
the
extent
that
burlington
northern
or
newco
is
permitted
to
do
so,
it
shall
permit
milwaukee
in,
and
yet
their
hands
in
portland
have
been
effectively
tied
certainly
as
far
as
this
great
public
industrial
development
at
rivergate
is
concerned
by
the
restrictive
agreements
that
they
have
entered
into,
and
we
contend
that
therefore
milwaukee
in
this
acquisition
case
should
be
granted
the
right
to
control
peninsula
or
have
a
share
in
the
control
of
peninsula
and
also
should
have
a
right
to
get
trackage
rights
to
get
in
there
under
the
northern
lines
decision.
we
also
feel
that
the
public
interest
requires
southern
pacific
to
get
in
there
so
that
all
four
major
line-haul
carriers
will
be
able
to
serve
portland.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
we
feel
that
cases
that
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
and
which
justices
cited
in
theirs,
that
similar
kind
of
port
developments
have
been
granted
equal
access
by
all
of
the
line-haul
carriers
in
there.
the
calumet
port
case
was
one
which
comes
to
my
mind
immediately
that
was
cited.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
that
is
the
circumstance
that
we
do
not
have,
and
therefore
i
do
not
know.
this
is
not
a
railroad
development;
this
is
a
public
development.
the
railroads
just
happened
to
go
by
at
the
time
and
it
is
only
through
the
confusion
of
public
money
that
this
low-lying
land
is
being
able
to
be
developed
into
this
excellent
port
and
industrial
facilities,
so
therefore
it
belongs
to
no
railroad.
this
is
one
of
the
points
that
the
commission
got
off
on
as
deciding
that
this
was
an
invasion
of
union
pacific
in
burlington
northern’s
territory.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
it
was
just
getting
underway
your
honor;
that
is
correct.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
i
do
not
know
whether
it
would
have
been
taken
into
consideration
in
the
northern
lines
case,
but
i
think
had
the
peninsula
terminal
acquisition
come
up
four
or
five
years
after
the
northern
lines
had
been
implemented,
the
commission
would
have
taken
more
cognizance
of
rivergate
and
its
importance
than
it
did
in
its
decision.
it
is
one
of
our
contentions
that
all
the
commission
did
was
concentrate
on
this
little
3.79
mile
railroad
with
a
declining
number
of
cars.
i
think
only
2700
in
1967
the
evidence
here
of
which
southern
pacific
had
about
17%
and
milwaukee
had
about
1%
and
the
icc
said
or
the
commission
said,
well
such
a
little
railroad
is
this
and
such
a
small
amount
of
traffic,
let
us
not
worry
about
this
industrial
development,
and
in
so
doing
cut
milwaukee
out
of
the
single
biggest
industrial
area
that
possibly
could
be
in
portland.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
well
--
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
yes
sir.
it
is
not
only
its
access
but
joint
ownership
enables
them
to
participate
in
routes
and
divisions
and
rates
which
they
could
not
do
it.
they
merely
have
to
have
--
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
yes
sir,
but
this
is
a
peculiar
hybrid
type
of
railroad
and
--
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
yes
sir.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
yes
sir.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
they
can
switch
--
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
well,
they
can
go
to
barnes
--
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
they
can
go
to
hoyt
yard
and
switch
back
to
peninsula
and
absorb
the
switching
charge
and
lose
a
day
as
advantage
over
the
other.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
no,
i
will
try
to
address
myself
to
that.
the
peninsula
terminal
company
as
the
record
shows
does
not
get
its
money
by
a
switching
charge.
there
is
a
switching
charge
from
point
3
to
point
--
to
peninsula
road
that
is
the
switching
charge.
but
when
it
gets
to
peninsula
then
it
is
a
division
rate
which
is
a
negotiated
rate.
now
there
is
a
lot
of
confusion
in
this
in
the
commission’s
brief.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
no
sir,
no
sir.
we
cite
case
to
you
your
honor,
the
l&n
railroad
company
against
the
united
states
242
u.s.
69.
we
are
told
that
a
railroad
in
this
situation
does
not
have
to
treat
others
on
the
same
basis
as
they
treat
their
owners.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
yes
sir.
and
also
joint
ownership
will
permit
every
industry
that
locates
in
rivergate
and
is
served
by
milwaukee
to
be
an
online
milwaukee
industry
if
there
is
joint
ownership.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
but
they
are
then
entitled
to
publish
their
true
rates,
they
issue
the
billing,
it
is
handled
as
if
it
is
their
own
car,
and
it
is
getting
into
different
parts
of
my
argument.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
that
is
alright
your
honor.
it
will
be
single
carrier
routing.
it
will
be
improved
terminal
service
if
they
are
part
of
the
owner.
common
ownership
assures
the
use
of
modern
railroad
technology
and
there
will
be
rate
benefits
by
them
all
three
being
common
owners.
i
should
also
like
to
comment
on
the
strange
procedure
that
burlington
northern
and
union
pacific
adopted
in
this
case.
in
their
brief
which
is
field
to
this
court,
they
made
a
settlement
offer
to
milwaukee
which
is
in
the
extremely
strange
place
in
the
proceeding
to
try
to
make
the
settlement
offer.
we
contend
that
it
is
a
last
minute
recognition
of
the
fact
that
the
commission
was
wrong,
when
it
decided
there
would
be
no
detriment
to
the
public.
this
offer
really
does
not
give
milwaukee
anything
other
than
the
saving
of
an
unnecessary
switch
charge
--
this
goes
to
mr.
justice
white’s
question
--
to
deliver
cars
to
peninsula
and
possibly
a
savings
in
time.
however,
burlington
northern
and
union
pacific,
under
the
offer
they
made,
will
still
control
peninsula.
they
can
control
its
development
as
well
as
the
development
of
rivergate.
they
have
still
been
able
to
insert
themselves
between
milwaukee
and
rivergate
by
this
controlled
company.
we
think
that
this
recognition
of
--
their
own
recognition
certainly
demands
that
it
be
remanded.
i
spoke
in
a
great
deal
about
milwaukee
in
this
argument
because
they
are
in
a
slightly
different
factual
situation
because
of
the
northern
lines
merger
case.
but
we
feel
the
public
interest
equally
require
southern
pacific
to
have
access
to
this
industrial
area.
same
benefits
of
single
routing,
improved
terminal
service,
modern
technology
and
rate
benefits
would
apply
if
the
southern
pacific
was
equally
there.
the
testimony
in
this
case
is
that
there
is
an
upholding
over
30-hour
delay
in
delivering
a
southern
pacific
car
from
point
6
to
point
7.
it
takes
them
over
30
hours
to
traverse
that
5.2
miles.
obviously
that
traffic
is
not
being
handled
as
expeditiously
as
it
can
even
on
this
little
small
volume
that
the
peninsula
terminal
carries
now.
how
can
they
possibly
handle
500-600
cars
a
day
with
delays
like
that?
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
just
very
briefly
answer
a
few
comments.
i
referred
the
court
to
take
the
time
we
have
allotted
to
our
brief
and
the
justice
department
brief
which
points
out
what
the
commission
did
and
did
not
find
as
contrasted
to
what
have
the
commission
now
argues
before
this
court.
they
have
made
no
findings
similar
to
what
is
being
argued
here
today
and
i
commend
our
briefs
to
you
on
that
point.
counsel
has
made
much
in
his
brief
and
much
in
his
argument
of
matters
that
are
entirely
outside
the
record
in
this
case.
he
spends
a
great
deal
of
time
in
his
brief
and
in
his
argument
on
the
reciprocal
switching
arrangement
which
was
not
entered
into
at
all,
before
this
case
was
decided
and
on
its
way
up
here.
so
how
can
the
commission
have
taken
into
account
the
reciprocal
switching
arrangement
when
it
was
not
even
entered
into.
i
am
also
advised
by
a
counsel
for
milwaukee
that
my
statement
that
i
made
on
peninsula
and
insisting
upon
the
division
rates
is
absolutely
accurate.
and
it
has
had
great
deal
of
difficulty
in
publishing
these
rates
upon
its
entry
to
portland
that
is
outside
the
record.
but
we
have
been
arguing
outside
the
record
as
counsel
has
begun.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
yes
sir
there
was.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
none
that
i
know
of
sir.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
we
must
spend
a
couple
of
hours
your
honor.
we
were
each
granted
a
half
an
hour
and
i
took
my
full
time
and
mr.
shapiro
of
the
department
of
justice
was
granted
about
the
same
time.
the
commission
and
union
pacific
each
presented
arguments
and
we
all
ran
over
our
allotted
30
minutes,
i
think
we
must
have
spent
close
to
two
hours
in
arguing.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
no
sir.
i
have
practiced
before
that
court
your
honor.[laughter]
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
judge
kilkenny
was
the
circuit
judge
assigned
to
that
case.
he
has
just
taken
retirement
within
the
last
30
days.
judge
stolman
(ph)
was
chief
judge
of
the
oregon
court
and
he
has
gone
to
senior
judge
status
within
the
last
30
days.
mr.
lofton
l.
tatum
yes
sir,
yes
sir,
they
are
still
in
court.
our
real
summary
of
this
case
your
honor,
gentlemen,
is
that
the
real
issue
in
this
case
is
not
the
right
of
the
railroads
to
serve.
the
real
issue,
as
we
see
it,
is
the
right
of
the
public
to
be
served
in
this
great
rivergate
area.
thank
you.
