mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
peninsula
is
a
very
small
terminal
railroad,
which
runs
a
few
hundred
feet
inland
of
the
columbia
river
more
precisely
the
oregon’s
loop
in
the
northern
part
of
portland
and
the
distance
from
the
one
extremity
and
i
personally
prefer
using
the
map
in
that
appendix
273
rather
than
just
analyzing
map
in
the
brief
of
the
appellants.
and
the
map
at
273
indicates
that
peninsula
extends
a
distance
of
about
a
mile-and-a-half
and
from
the
multnomah
county
fair
grounds
and
on
the
east,
and
two
a
pole
in
debarking
and
storage
facility
of
the
crown
zellerbach
corporation
on
the
west.
if
that
railroad
were
super
imposed
on
pennsylvania
avenue,
entire
railroad
would
not
extend
from
the
capital
to
the
white
house.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
and
i
shall
be
getting
into
the
alleged
strategic
location
in
just
a
moment
your
honor.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
yes,
your
honor.
there
are
some
13
industries
that
are
served
by
the
peninsula
in
a
way
together
and
generate
approximately
10
cars
a
day.
but
the
interest
is
not
so
much
in
the
peninsula
as
it
is
presently
organized
in
industries
it
presently
serves,
but
rather
the
interest
stands
from
the
adjacent
north
rivergate
industrial
and
district
property
and
the
expectation
that
it
might
be
developed
and
that
rivergate
--
and
that
the
peninsula
might
be
a
railroad
access
to
a
portion
of
that
property
so-called
north
rivergate.
rivergate
is
an
area
of
about
four-and-a-half
square
miles
situated
at
the
confluence
of
the
willamette
and
the
columbia
rivers.
and
it
is
indeed
and
being
developed
as
a
port
and
industrial
facility
and
it
is
expected
and
that
upon
completion
it
will
generate
approximately
five
million
tons
of
railroad
traffic
annually
acquiring
the
use
of
100
car
trains
totaling
about
500-600
cars
a
day.
in
their
briefs
the
appellants
fall
the
commission
for
seemingly
ignoring
in
the
potential
growth
of
rivergate
and
its
needs
for
railroad
service.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
commission’s
report
recites
the
evidence,
the
summary
of
the
evidence
pertaining
to
that.
we
submit
that
the
appellants
quarrel
really
is
what
the
commission
is
waiting
of
that
evidence
and
matter
clearly
for
the
agency.
against
that
evidence
and
there
--
it
was
evidence
of
record
and
that
the
rivergate
currently
is
a
marshland
and
it
is
subject
to
flooding
periodically.
practically
all
of
it
remains
to
be
filled
graded.
practically
all
that
remains
to
be
supplied
with
utilities,
roads,
piers
and
docks,
and
the
completion
of
the
plans
for
rivergate
is
on
15
or
more
years
distant
and
will
require
the
expenditure
of
an
excess
of
$500
million.
but
even
if
we
were
to
assume
and
that
the
rivergate
district
were
to
be
developed
and
were
to
become
the
source
of
traffic
that
its
developers
hope,
is
by
no
mean
certain
and
that
this
railroad
peninsula
terminal
company
will
be
the
access
into
north
rivergate.
for
one
thing
--
and
peninsula
provides
only
one
of
three
routes
into
the
area.
the
first
route
to
which
the
north
rivergate
area
would
be
in
extension
of
an
industrial
spur
that
is
already
on
the
rivergate
property.
the
industrial
spur
that
already
serves
and
most
of
the
plants
presently
situated
there.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
yes,
your
honor.
a
second
alternative
would
be
a
spur
to
be
built
and
directly
from
the
main
line
of
the
burlington.
rustically
directly
into
the
north
rivergate
property
and
that
land
for
that
has
been
acquired,
much
of
it
has
been
filled
and
graded
to
permit
the
construction.
the
witnesses
for
the
port
of
portland
brotherly
acknowledged
that
they
were
in
these
alternatives
and
that
no
selection
of
the
route
into
north
rivergate
had
been
made.
the
condition
of
the
peninsula
terminal
company
and
its
structural
limitations
suggest
that
it
really
will
never
become
the
route
into
north
rivergate.
its
tracks
which
are
of
relative
light
weight
are
built
upon
sand.
its
clearances
passing
as
it
does
dust
and
through
a
trestle,
carrying
the
main
line
of
the
burlington
northern
overhead
and
has
a
limited
dimension,
and
finally
the
line
itself
is
loaded
by
the
heavy
curvatures.
as
the
peninsula
line
leaves
the
trestle
beneath
the
--
in
burlington
northern,
it
crosses
at
great
and
without
electric
warning
device
under
the
north
portland
road
which
connects
just
a
few
blocks
away
with
interstate
highway
5.
indeed
the
leading
witness
for
the
port
of
portland,
dr.
grober
plymann
(ph)
acknowledged
that
peninsula
could
not
handle
the
projected
traffic
to
and
from
rivergate.
he
acknowledged
on
cross
examination
that
peninsula
would
have
to
be
redesigned,
rebuilt,
and
the
fact
establishes
that
the
100
car
trains,
which
he
indicated
the
development
of
rivergate
required,
could
not
even
fit
upon
the
tracks
of
the
peninsula
terminal
company.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
yes.
mr.
chief
justice
the
significant
thing
in
this
case
really
is
that
affected
service
on
a
terminal
company
does
not
require
ownership.
an
enjoined
and
equal
ownership
of
a
terminal
company
has
never
been
required
to
enable
connecting
trunk
line
railroads
ineffectively
and
to
serve
industries
upon
that
terminal
company.
just
within
the
portland
area,
and
i
would
like
to
at
this
point
refer
the
court
into
the
map
which
is
at
appendix
355.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
stock
ownership
is
not
required
to
permit
effective
service
upon
a
terminal
company.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
in
this
case
your
honor
it
simply
held
that
southern
pacific
and
milwaukee
should
not
be
included
as
equal
owners
together
with
the
burlington
northern
and
the
union
pacific.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
that
is
correct
your
honor,
yes
sir,
right.
there
are
two
other
terminal
companies
in
the
portland
area.
on
the
west
side
of
the
willamette
river,
there
is
the
portland
terminal
company
which
is
owned
jointly
by
the
southern
pacific,
burlington
northern
and
union
pacific.
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
crossing
the
steel
bridge
and
going
somewhat
south
on
the
east
side
of
the
willamette
river
is
another
terminal
company,
the
portland
traction
company
which
is
owned
only
by
the
southern
pacific
and
the
union
pacific.
now
there
is
not
the
slightest
suggestion
in
this
case
that
these
terminal
companies
performed
any
less
effectively
for
the
other
trunk
line
railroads
in
reaching
portland
than
they
do
for
their
owners.
this
comes
about,
because
the
trunk
line
railroads
serving
portland
to
get
in
cooperation
with
the
terminal
railroads
have
entered
into
every
term
a
reciprocal
switching
arrangement.
under
the
reciprocal
switching
arrangement
in
portland
which
is
not
at
all
unlike
those
that
exist
at
most
major
railroad
terminals.
the
cars
of
any
one
railroad
can
reach
the
industries
of
all
of
them
upon
the
line-haul
rate
and
with
the
switching
charges
being
absorbed
by
the
railroads
not
being
added
as
an
added
burden
upon
the
shippers.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
i
beg
to
differ
with
the
counsel
on
the
other
side.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
milwaukee
and
the
southern
pacific
stand
competitively,
and
these
would
be
shippers
in
trying
to
reach
portland,
trying
to
ship
from
portland,
exactly
as
do
the
burlington
northern
and
the
union
pacific.
the
situation
will
be
--
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
i
am
afraid
so
your
honor.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
in
the
finding
of
the
commission
it
was
expressed
in
terms
of
no
showing
really
having
been
made
in
any
advantages,
and
they
might
float
to
the
southern
pacific
in
the
milwaukee
as
a
result
of
four
part
ownership.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
yes.
this
comes
about
as
follows:
the
lines
that
the
southern
pacific
terminate
in
east
portland,
some
distance
from
the
peninsula
terminal
company
for
its
cars
to
reach
the
peninsula
terminal
company
requires
that
the
southern
pacific
turn
over
its
cars
to
the
union
pacific,
and
that
transfer
occurs
at
the
so-called
albina
yard.
the
cars
as
they
are
turned
over
by
the
southern
pacific
to
the
union
pacific
include
cars
destined
to
other
points
and
other
industries
on
the
union
pacific
lines,
they
are
mingled
in
the
transfer
trains
with
other
union
pacific
cars.
the
train
then
proceeds
to
affect
the
deliveries
to
the
various
industries
along
the
line
goes
to
the
canton
yard
and
eventually
does
wind
up
at
peninsula.
now
at
such
times
as
the
southern
pacific
tenders
sufficient
traffic
to
justify
it
and
the
union
pacific
is
perfectly
delighted
that
they
could
train
all
through
and
affect
that
connection
more
rapidly.
finally
i
submit
mr.
justice
blackmun
now
there
is
simply
was
no
complaint
by
any
shipper
that's
on
the
peninsula
under
the
service
currently
being
received.
i
started
to
say
that
the
peninsula
at
its
dealings
with
the
trunk-line
railroads
reaching
portland
will
be
no
different
following
the
ownership
by
the
burlington
northern
and
the
union
pacific
than
obtains
presently
on
the
portland
traction
company
or
the
portland
terminal
company.
and
the
southern
pacific
and
the
milwaukee
no
less
and
the
burlington
northern
and
the
union
pacific
they
will
be
able
to
publish
single
line
rates
turned
from
portland,
and
under
such
rates
render
service
to
industries
on
the
peninsula.
in
fact,
they
had
done
so
as
i
hope
to
develop
later
on
southern
pacific
has
participated
to
the
extent
that
20%
of
all
peninsula’s
traffic.
i
think
that
the
appellant
railroads
misconceived
in
what
are
the
rights
and
the
opportunities
afforded
to
the
union
pacific
and
the
burlington
northern
as
a
result
of
their
ownership
of
the
peninsula
terminal
company.
and
the
support
of
the
public
bodies
i
think
is
equally
incorrectly
premised.
first,
they
contend
that
as
owners
of
the
peninsula,
burlington
northern
and
union
pacific
and
will
be
able
to
operate
their
trains
on
the
peninsula
tracks,
thereby
avoiding
a
time
consuming
interchange
and
their
switch
of
equipment.
we
submit
they
are
wrong.
the
record
shows
peninsula
terminal
company
will
remain
a
separate
company.
that
in
order
for
the
union
pacific
and
the
burlington
northern
to
get
on
the
tracks
of
the
peninsula
and
they
will
need
to
file
an
application
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission
for
trackage
rights
under
section
5
(2)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
protestants
will
have
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
at
that
time.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
i
think
the
department
of
justice
with
all
due
respect
did
not
understand
as
a
result
of
this
transaction
the
burlington
northern
and
the
union
pacific
were
not
accorded
trackage
rights
upon
the
peninsula
trackage.
that
is
correct
sir
your
honor.
secondly
--
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
no
sir.
the
trackage
--
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
conceivably
even
on
the
absence
of
the
acquiescence
of
the
owning
road,
another
road
can
acquire
trackage
rights
through
authorization
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
yes
sir.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
yes
sir,
right.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
yes
sir.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
that
is
it
exactly.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
they
would
indeed.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
i
am
afraid
so.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
oh!
[laughter]
i
suspect
that
is
right.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
right
and
i
think
in
the
--
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
i
think
the
record
shows
mr.
justice
white
that
--
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
condition
24
--
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
milwaukee
is
there.
its
trains
run
daily
into
the
portland.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
very
possibly
and
in
fact
if
the
circumstance
ever
arose
the
commission
would
be
receptive
into
reopening
the
northern
lines
case.
it
is
expressly
reserved
that
in
this
report,
in
the
report
in
order.
i
start
to
say
that
a
second
advantage
that
the
appellant’s
claim,
that
the
burlington
northern
union
pacific
will
have
through
their
ownership
of
peninsula,
is
that
somehow
peninsula
will
accord
them
more
favorable
rates
and
more
favorable
divisions,
but
i
think
as
mr.
justice
white
i
believe
it
was
pointed
out,
peninsula
will
remain
in
a
separate
railroad.
it
is
subject
to
all
the
provisions
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
the
commission
has
many
times
held
and
we
have
discussed
that
fully
at
page
23
of
our
brief
that
a
terminal
railroad
simply
cannot,
under
section
3
(4)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
assess
one
connecting
carrier
on
higher
charge
than
another
for
like
services.
and
finally
with
respect
to
the
suggestion
and
that
somehow
burlington
northern
and
union
pacific
as
owners
of
the
peninsula
railroad
will
be
able
to
more
favorably
allocate
traffic,
i
beg
to
invite
the
court’s
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
commission
attached
conditions,
conditions
which
require
that
the
past
policy
of
neutrality
in
the
allocation
of
traffic,
a
policy
of
neutrality
to
which
the
new
owners
have
committed
themselves
must
be
observed.
these
conditions
are
enforceable
and
if
need
be
they
can
be
stricken
by
the
commission.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
this
was
just
to
pin
it
down
further
mr.
chief
justice.
they
need
to
publish
--
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
i
doubt
very
much
that
they
are
that
much
concerned
about
the
allocation
of
traffic.
i
think
ultimately
this
comes
down
to
the
price
at
which
the
milwaukee
gets
onto
the
peninsula.
this
thing
as
we
see
it
is
the
essence
of
the
case.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
it
pays
the
switching
--
it
does
not
pay
a
switching
charge
to
reach
the
interchange
tracks.
that
work
is
being
done
for
the
milwaukee
by
the
burlington
northern
under
contractual
arrangement
that
they
entered
into.
it
is
a
so
called
injoint
facility
and
the
contract
charge
is
considerably
less
than
the
switch
charge
and
of
course
as
mr.
tatum
has
indicated
the
southern
pacific
and
the
union
pacific
have
agreed,
have
offered
to
permit
the
cars
to
go
directly
onto
the
interchange
tracks
up,
so
that
a
direct
physical
connection
with
peninsula
can
be
made
under
a
similar
joint
facility
contract
arrangement.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
yes.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
a
share
of
going
to
peninsula
approximately
$30
per
car
is
identical.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
everyone.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
yes
sir.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
there
is
no
--
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
i
do
not
think
the
case
was
possible
for
the
commission
or
is
it
being
presented
to
this
court
in
terms
of
deriving
an
ownership
profit
from
the
railroad.
well,
i
think
that
the
real
concern
is
whether
milwaukee
and
the
southern
pacific
can
reach
the
peninsula
industries
hopefully
to
develop
rivergate
upon
equally
competitive,
equal
competitive
terms.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
and
the
inclusion
of
the
milwaukee
--
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
yes
sir.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
no
sir.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
oh!
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
the
articulated
reason
of
the
commission’s
report
--
the
commission
i
think
beginning
at
page
31
and
it
was
certainly
a
fact
that
in
peninsula
and
the
union
pacific
in
burlington
northern
had
developed
this
area
and
they
should
not
be
deprived
of
the
fruits
of
their
labors
if
you
will.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
yes
sir.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
profits
from
the
operations
of
the
peninsula.
but
certainly
--
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
i
would
not
have
invested
on
this
but
the
union
pacific
and
burlington
northern
felt
as
they
say.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
that
and
of
course
in
the
event
that
the
railroad
were
rebuilt,
were
redesigned
and
did
indeed
become
the
access
to
rivergate,
i
am
sure
that
burlington
northern
and
northern
pacific
would
want
its
share
of
the
traffic.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
and
that
would
be
one
of
their
great
opportunities
as
owners.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
but
the
selection
of
the
two
other
alternatives
would
be
beyond
their
control.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
and
the
loop
--
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
yes
your
honor.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
the
response
in
the
commission
was
that
the
close
working
relationship
between
the
peninsula,
burlington
northern
and
union
pacific
extending
back
to
the
turn
of
this
entry
entitles
these
carriers
in
the
area
to
the
present
and
potential
traffic
so
long
as
the
milwaukee
and
the
southern
pacific
were
not
disadvantaged
and
they
are
competing
for
the
traffic
in
and
out
of
the
peninsula
industries
or
the
rivergate
industry.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
that
is
right.
the
commission
viewed
it
in
terms
of
the
national
transportation
policy
and
assuring
that
in
peninsula
the
railroads
connecting
whether
they
will
remain
viable
industries,
railroads.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
the
promise
of
the
northern
lines
case
made
to
the
milwaukee,
made
to
this
court,
we
submit,
has
been
kept
and
milwaukee
is
on
portland,
it
is
in
portland
as
an
effective
competitor.
it
can
compete
for
traffic,
turn
from
peninsula
on
its
local
rates
and
on
rates
that
are
a
little
higher
than
the
rates
of
the
burlington
northern
and
the
union
pacific.
that
promise
has
been
kept
and
the
ownership
of
peninsula
by
two
of
these
roads
in
no
way
will
diminish
milwaukee’s
opportunity.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
none
your
honor.
with
respect
to
mr.
tatum’s
reference
and
to
late
calumet
harbor
case
and
in
the
proceedings
of
the
commission
where
it
has
permitted
--
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
the
no
opinions?
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
hopefully
not
too
often
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
i
was
going
to
say
that
the
calumet
harbor
case
that
is
known
before
you
is,
and
illinois
central
versus
norfolk
&
western
case
385
u.s.
57,
is
distinguishable
in
that
and
there
as
this
court
noted,
one
trunk
line
railroad
actually
operated
into
the
port
area
under
consideration
and
all
other
trunk
line
railroads
are
seeking
to
serve
that
port
had
to
depend
on
the
facility
of
that
one
railroad.
that
situation
does
not
here
obtain.
the
burlington
northern
and
union
pacific
will
not
operate
on
the
tracks
of
the
peninsula.
their
cars
just
as
the
cars
of
the
milwaukee
and
the
southern
pacific
will
need
to
be
interchanged
to
switch
into
the
peninsula
and
the
solicitation
efforts
of
the
four
railroads
each
will
stand
on
equal
footing.
southern
pacific
as
i
indicated
earlier
therefore
has
participated
in
20%
of
the
traffic
to
and
from
peninsula.
even
it
was
a
disadvantage
of
its
lines
terminating
5-6
miles
from
peninsula
at
east
portland
and
it
is
being
dependent
on
intervening
movement
by
the
union
pacific
or
the
burlington
northern
to
reach
the
peninsula
industries.0
i
think
the
hard
facts
of
this
case
show
that
we
have
a
little
railroad
with
light
traffic
and
little
prospect
for
great
expansion
and
the
commission
on
balance
determined
that
there
simply
were
not
sufficient
advantages
in
a
four
part
ownership
to
be
able
to
find
and
that
inclusion
of
the
milwaukee
and
the
southern
pacific
would
be
consistent
with
the
public
interest.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
certainly
as
the
applications
were
postured
mr.
chief
justice
such
ownership
included
the
right
to
operate
and
of
course
and
that
was
part
of
the
application
and
you
have
decided
disadvantages
of
congestion
and
the
disruption
of
the
operations
of
that
small
railroad.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
no,
i
meant
by
that
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
track
simply
is
not
incapable
of
sustaining
the
operations
of
four
railroads.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
peninsula
is
a
very
small
terminal
railroad,
which
runs
a
few
hundred
feet
inland
of
the
columbia
river
more
precisely
the
oregon’s
loop
in
the
northern
part
of
portland
and
the
distance
from
the
one
extremity
and
i
personally
prefer
using
the
map
in
that
appendix
273
rather
than
just
analyzing
map
in
the
brief
of
the
appellants.
and
the
map
at
273
indicates
that
peninsula
extends
a
distance
of
about
a
mile-and-a-half
and
from
the
multnomah
county
fair
grounds
and
on
the
east,
and
two
a
pole
in
debarking
and
storage
facility
of
the
crown
zellerbach
corporation
on
the
west.
if
that
railroad
were
super
imposed
on
pennsylvania
avenue,
entire
railroad
would
not
extend
from
the
capital
to
the
white
house.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
and
i
shall
be
getting
into
the
alleged
strategic
location
in
just
a
moment
your
honor.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
yes,
your
honor.
there
are
some
13
industries
that
are
served
by
the
peninsula
in
a
way
together
and
generate
approximately
10
cars
a
day.
but
the
interest
is
not
so
much
in
the
peninsula
as
it
is
presently
organized
in
industries
it
presently
serves,
but
rather
the
interest
stands
from
the
adjacent
north
rivergate
industrial
and
district
property
and
the
expectation
that
it
might
be
developed
and
that
rivergate
--
and
that
the
peninsula
might
be
a
railroad
access
to
a
portion
of
that
property
so-called
north
rivergate.
rivergate
is
an
area
of
about
four-and-a-half
square
miles
situated
at
the
confluence
of
the
willamette
and
the
columbia
rivers.
and
it
is
indeed
and
being
developed
as
a
port
and
industrial
facility
and
it
is
expected
and
that
upon
completion
it
will
generate
approximately
five
million
tons
of
railroad
traffic
annually
acquiring
the
use
of
100
car
trains
totaling
about
500-600
cars
a
day.
in
their
briefs
the
appellants
fall
the
commission
for
seemingly
ignoring
in
the
potential
growth
of
rivergate
and
its
needs
for
railroad
service.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
commission’s
report
recites
the
evidence,
the
summary
of
the
evidence
pertaining
to
that.
we
submit
that
the
appellants
quarrel
really
is
what
the
commission
is
waiting
of
that
evidence
and
matter
clearly
for
the
agency.
against
that
evidence
and
there
--
it
was
evidence
of
record
and
that
the
rivergate
currently
is
a
marshland
and
it
is
subject
to
flooding
periodically.
practically
all
of
it
remains
to
be
filled
graded.
practically
all
that
remains
to
be
supplied
with
utilities,
roads,
piers
and
docks,
and
the
completion
of
the
plans
for
rivergate
is
on
15
or
more
years
distant
and
will
require
the
expenditure
of
an
excess
of
$500
million.
but
even
if
we
were
to
assume
and
that
the
rivergate
district
were
to
be
developed
and
were
to
become
the
source
of
traffic
that
its
developers
hope,
is
by
no
mean
certain
and
that
this
railroad
peninsula
terminal
company
will
be
the
access
into
north
rivergate.
for
one
thing
--
and
peninsula
provides
only
one
of
three
routes
into
the
area.
the
first
route
to
which
the
north
rivergate
area
would
be
in
extension
of
an
industrial
spur
that
is
already
on
the
rivergate
property.
the
industrial
spur
that
already
serves
and
most
of
the
plants
presently
situated
there.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
yes,
your
honor.
a
second
alternative
would
be
a
spur
to
be
built
and
directly
from
the
main
line
of
the
burlington.
rustically
directly
into
the
north
rivergate
property
and
that
land
for
that
has
been
acquired,
much
of
it
has
been
filled
and
graded
to
permit
the
construction.
the
witnesses
for
the
port
of
portland
brotherly
acknowledged
that
they
were
in
these
alternatives
and
that
no
selection
of
the
route
into
north
rivergate
had
been
made.
the
condition
of
the
peninsula
terminal
company
and
its
structural
limitations
suggest
that
it
really
will
never
become
the
route
into
north
rivergate.
its
tracks
which
are
of
relative
light
weight
are
built
upon
sand.
its
clearances
passing
as
it
does
dust
and
through
a
trestle,
carrying
the
main
line
of
the
burlington
northern
overhead
and
has
a
limited
dimension,
and
finally
the
line
itself
is
loaded
by
the
heavy
curvatures.
as
the
peninsula
line
leaves
the
trestle
beneath
the
--
in
burlington
northern,
it
crosses
at
great
and
without
electric
warning
device
under
the
north
portland
road
which
connects
just
a
few
blocks
away
with
interstate
highway
5.
indeed
the
leading
witness
for
the
port
of
portland,
dr.
grober
plymann
(ph)
acknowledged
that
peninsula
could
not
handle
the
projected
traffic
to
and
from
rivergate.
he
acknowledged
on
cross
examination
that
peninsula
would
have
to
be
redesigned,
rebuilt,
and
the
fact
establishes
that
the
100
car
trains,
which
he
indicated
the
development
of
rivergate
required,
could
not
even
fit
upon
the
tracks
of
the
peninsula
terminal
company.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
yes.
mr.
chief
justice
the
significant
thing
in
this
case
really
is
that
affected
service
on
a
terminal
company
does
not
require
ownership.
an
enjoined
and
equal
ownership
of
a
terminal
company
has
never
been
required
to
enable
connecting
trunk
line
railroads
ineffectively
and
to
serve
industries
upon
that
terminal
company.
just
within
the
portland
area,
and
i
would
like
to
at
this
point
refer
the
court
into
the
map
which
is
at
appendix
355.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
stock
ownership
is
not
required
to
permit
effective
service
upon
a
terminal
company.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
in
this
case
your
honor
it
simply
held
that
southern
pacific
and
milwaukee
should
not
be
included
as
equal
owners
together
with
the
burlington
northern
and
the
union
pacific.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
that
is
correct
your
honor,
yes
sir,
right.
there
are
two
other
terminal
companies
in
the
portland
area.
on
the
west
side
of
the
willamette
river,
there
is
the
portland
terminal
company
which
is
owned
jointly
by
the
southern
pacific,
burlington
northern
and
union
pacific.
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
crossing
the
steel
bridge
and
going
somewhat
south
on
the
east
side
of
the
willamette
river
is
another
terminal
company,
the
portland
traction
company
which
is
owned
only
by
the
southern
pacific
and
the
union
pacific.
now
there
is
not
the
slightest
suggestion
in
this
case
that
these
terminal
companies
performed
any
less
effectively
for
the
other
trunk
line
railroads
in
reaching
portland
than
they
do
for
their
owners.
this
comes
about,
because
the
trunk
line
railroads
serving
portland
to
get
in
cooperation
with
the
terminal
railroads
have
entered
into
every
term
a
reciprocal
switching
arrangement.
under
the
reciprocal
switching
arrangement
in
portland
which
is
not
at
all
unlike
those
that
exist
at
most
major
railroad
terminals.
the
cars
of
any
one
railroad
can
reach
the
industries
of
all
of
them
upon
the
line-haul
rate
and
with
the
switching
charges
being
absorbed
by
the
railroads
not
being
added
as
an
added
burden
upon
the
shippers.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
i
beg
to
differ
with
the
counsel
on
the
other
side.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
milwaukee
and
the
southern
pacific
stand
competitively,
and
these
would
be
shippers
in
trying
to
reach
portland,
trying
to
ship
from
portland,
exactly
as
do
the
burlington
northern
and
the
union
pacific.
the
situation
will
be
--
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
i
am
afraid
so
your
honor.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
in
the
finding
of
the
commission
it
was
expressed
in
terms
of
no
showing
really
having
been
made
in
any
advantages,
and
they
might
float
to
the
southern
pacific
in
the
milwaukee
as
a
result
of
four
part
ownership.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
yes.
this
comes
about
as
follows:
the
lines
that
the
southern
pacific
terminate
in
east
portland,
some
distance
from
the
peninsula
terminal
company
for
its
cars
to
reach
the
peninsula
terminal
company
requires
that
the
southern
pacific
turn
over
its
cars
to
the
union
pacific,
and
that
transfer
occurs
at
the
so-called
albina
yard.
the
cars
as
they
are
turned
over
by
the
southern
pacific
to
the
union
pacific
include
cars
destined
to
other
points
and
other
industries
on
the
union
pacific
lines,
they
are
mingled
in
the
transfer
trains
with
other
union
pacific
cars.
the
train
then
proceeds
to
affect
the
deliveries
to
the
various
industries
along
the
line
goes
to
the
canton
yard
and
eventually
does
wind
up
at
peninsula.
now
at
such
times
as
the
southern
pacific
tenders
sufficient
traffic
to
justify
it
and
the
union
pacific
is
perfectly
delighted
that
they
could
train
all
through
and
affect
that
connection
more
rapidly.
finally
i
submit
mr.
justice
blackmun
now
there
is
simply
was
no
complaint
by
any
shipper
that's
on
the
peninsula
under
the
service
currently
being
received.
i
started
to
say
that
the
peninsula
at
its
dealings
with
the
trunk-line
railroads
reaching
portland
will
be
no
different
following
the
ownership
by
the
burlington
northern
and
the
union
pacific
than
obtains
presently
on
the
portland
traction
company
or
the
portland
terminal
company.
and
the
southern
pacific
and
the
milwaukee
no
less
and
the
burlington
northern
and
the
union
pacific
they
will
be
able
to
publish
single
line
rates
turned
from
portland,
and
under
such
rates
render
service
to
industries
on
the
peninsula.
in
fact,
they
had
done
so
as
i
hope
to
develop
later
on
southern
pacific
has
participated
to
the
extent
that
20%
of
all
peninsula’s
traffic.
i
think
that
the
appellant
railroads
misconceived
in
what
are
the
rights
and
the
opportunities
afforded
to
the
union
pacific
and
the
burlington
northern
as
a
result
of
their
ownership
of
the
peninsula
terminal
company.
and
the
support
of
the
public
bodies
i
think
is
equally
incorrectly
premised.
first,
they
contend
that
as
owners
of
the
peninsula,
burlington
northern
and
union
pacific
and
will
be
able
to
operate
their
trains
on
the
peninsula
tracks,
thereby
avoiding
a
time
consuming
interchange
and
their
switch
of
equipment.
we
submit
they
are
wrong.
the
record
shows
peninsula
terminal
company
will
remain
a
separate
company.
that
in
order
for
the
union
pacific
and
the
burlington
northern
to
get
on
the
tracks
of
the
peninsula
and
they
will
need
to
file
an
application
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission
for
trackage
rights
under
section
5
(2)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
protestants
will
have
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
at
that
time.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
i
think
the
department
of
justice
with
all
due
respect
did
not
understand
as
a
result
of
this
transaction
the
burlington
northern
and
the
union
pacific
were
not
accorded
trackage
rights
upon
the
peninsula
trackage.
that
is
correct
sir
your
honor.
secondly
--
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
no
sir.
the
trackage
--
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
conceivably
even
on
the
absence
of
the
acquiescence
of
the
owning
road,
another
road
can
acquire
trackage
rights
through
authorization
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
yes
sir.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
yes
sir,
right.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
yes
sir.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
that
is
it
exactly.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
they
would
indeed.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
i
am
afraid
so.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
oh!
[laughter]
i
suspect
that
is
right.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
right
and
i
think
in
the
--
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
i
think
the
record
shows
mr.
justice
white
that
--
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
condition
24
--
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
milwaukee
is
there.
its
trains
run
daily
into
the
portland.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
very
possibly
and
in
fact
if
the
circumstance
ever
arose
the
commission
would
be
receptive
into
reopening
the
northern
lines
case.
it
is
expressly
reserved
that
in
this
report,
in
the
report
in
order.
i
start
to
say
that
a
second
advantage
that
the
appellant’s
claim,
that
the
burlington
northern
union
pacific
will
have
through
their
ownership
of
peninsula,
is
that
somehow
peninsula
will
accord
them
more
favorable
rates
and
more
favorable
divisions,
but
i
think
as
mr.
justice
white
i
believe
it
was
pointed
out,
peninsula
will
remain
in
a
separate
railroad.
it
is
subject
to
all
the
provisions
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
the
commission
has
many
times
held
and
we
have
discussed
that
fully
at
page
23
of
our
brief
that
a
terminal
railroad
simply
cannot,
under
section
3
(4)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
assess
one
connecting
carrier
on
higher
charge
than
another
for
like
services.
and
finally
with
respect
to
the
suggestion
and
that
somehow
burlington
northern
and
union
pacific
as
owners
of
the
peninsula
railroad
will
be
able
to
more
favorably
allocate
traffic,
i
beg
to
invite
the
court’s
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
commission
attached
conditions,
conditions
which
require
that
the
past
policy
of
neutrality
in
the
allocation
of
traffic,
a
policy
of
neutrality
to
which
the
new
owners
have
committed
themselves
must
be
observed.
these
conditions
are
enforceable
and
if
need
be
they
can
be
stricken
by
the
commission.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
this
was
just
to
pin
it
down
further
mr.
chief
justice.
they
need
to
publish
--
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
i
doubt
very
much
that
they
are
that
much
concerned
about
the
allocation
of
traffic.
i
think
ultimately
this
comes
down
to
the
price
at
which
the
milwaukee
gets
onto
the
peninsula.
this
thing
as
we
see
it
is
the
essence
of
the
case.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
it
pays
the
switching
--
it
does
not
pay
a
switching
charge
to
reach
the
interchange
tracks.
that
work
is
being
done
for
the
milwaukee
by
the
burlington
northern
under
contractual
arrangement
that
they
entered
into.
it
is
a
so
called
injoint
facility
and
the
contract
charge
is
considerably
less
than
the
switch
charge
and
of
course
as
mr.
tatum
has
indicated
the
southern
pacific
and
the
union
pacific
have
agreed,
have
offered
to
permit
the
cars
to
go
directly
onto
the
interchange
tracks
up,
so
that
a
direct
physical
connection
with
peninsula
can
be
made
under
a
similar
joint
facility
contract
arrangement.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
yes.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
a
share
of
going
to
peninsula
approximately
$30
per
car
is
identical.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
everyone.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
yes
sir.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
there
is
no
--
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
i
do
not
think
the
case
was
possible
for
the
commission
or
is
it
being
presented
to
this
court
in
terms
of
deriving
an
ownership
profit
from
the
railroad.
well,
i
think
that
the
real
concern
is
whether
milwaukee
and
the
southern
pacific
can
reach
the
peninsula
industries
hopefully
to
develop
rivergate
upon
equally
competitive,
equal
competitive
terms.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
and
the
inclusion
of
the
milwaukee
--
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
yes
sir.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
no
sir.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
oh!
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
the
articulated
reason
of
the
commission’s
report
--
the
commission
i
think
beginning
at
page
31
and
it
was
certainly
a
fact
that
in
peninsula
and
the
union
pacific
in
burlington
northern
had
developed
this
area
and
they
should
not
be
deprived
of
the
fruits
of
their
labors
if
you
will.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
yes
sir.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
profits
from
the
operations
of
the
peninsula.
but
certainly
--
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
i
would
not
have
invested
on
this
but
the
union
pacific
and
burlington
northern
felt
as
they
say.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
that
and
of
course
in
the
event
that
the
railroad
were
rebuilt,
were
redesigned
and
did
indeed
become
the
access
to
rivergate,
i
am
sure
that
burlington
northern
and
northern
pacific
would
want
its
share
of
the
traffic.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
and
that
would
be
one
of
their
great
opportunities
as
owners.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
but
the
selection
of
the
two
other
alternatives
would
be
beyond
their
control.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
and
the
loop
--
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
yes
your
honor.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
the
response
in
the
commission
was
that
the
close
working
relationship
between
the
peninsula,
burlington
northern
and
union
pacific
extending
back
to
the
turn
of
this
entry
entitles
these
carriers
in
the
area
to
the
present
and
potential
traffic
so
long
as
the
milwaukee
and
the
southern
pacific
were
not
disadvantaged
and
they
are
competing
for
the
traffic
in
and
out
of
the
peninsula
industries
or
the
rivergate
industry.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
that
is
right.
the
commission
viewed
it
in
terms
of
the
national
transportation
policy
and
assuring
that
in
peninsula
the
railroads
connecting
whether
they
will
remain
viable
industries,
railroads.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
the
promise
of
the
northern
lines
case
made
to
the
milwaukee,
made
to
this
court,
we
submit,
has
been
kept
and
milwaukee
is
on
portland,
it
is
in
portland
as
an
effective
competitor.
it
can
compete
for
traffic,
turn
from
peninsula
on
its
local
rates
and
on
rates
that
are
a
little
higher
than
the
rates
of
the
burlington
northern
and
the
union
pacific.
that
promise
has
been
kept
and
the
ownership
of
peninsula
by
two
of
these
roads
in
no
way
will
diminish
milwaukee’s
opportunity.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
none
your
honor.
with
respect
to
mr.
tatum’s
reference
and
to
late
calumet
harbor
case
and
in
the
proceedings
of
the
commission
where
it
has
permitted
--
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
the
no
opinions?
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
hopefully
not
too
often
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
i
was
going
to
say
that
the
calumet
harbor
case
that
is
known
before
you
is,
and
illinois
central
versus
norfolk
&
western
case
385
u.s.
57,
is
distinguishable
in
that
and
there
as
this
court
noted,
one
trunk
line
railroad
actually
operated
into
the
port
area
under
consideration
and
all
other
trunk
line
railroads
are
seeking
to
serve
that
port
had
to
depend
on
the
facility
of
that
one
railroad.
that
situation
does
not
here
obtain.
the
burlington
northern
and
union
pacific
will
not
operate
on
the
tracks
of
the
peninsula.
their
cars
just
as
the
cars
of
the
milwaukee
and
the
southern
pacific
will
need
to
be
interchanged
to
switch
into
the
peninsula
and
the
solicitation
efforts
of
the
four
railroads
each
will
stand
on
equal
footing.
southern
pacific
as
i
indicated
earlier
therefore
has
participated
in
20%
of
the
traffic
to
and
from
peninsula.
even
it
was
a
disadvantage
of
its
lines
terminating
5-6
miles
from
peninsula
at
east
portland
and
it
is
being
dependent
on
intervening
movement
by
the
union
pacific
or
the
burlington
northern
to
reach
the
peninsula
industries.0
i
think
the
hard
facts
of
this
case
show
that
we
have
a
little
railroad
with
light
traffic
and
little
prospect
for
great
expansion
and
the
commission
on
balance
determined
that
there
simply
were
not
sufficient
advantages
in
a
four
part
ownership
to
be
able
to
find
and
that
inclusion
of
the
milwaukee
and
the
southern
pacific
would
be
consistent
with
the
public
interest.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
certainly
as
the
applications
were
postured
mr.
chief
justice
such
ownership
included
the
right
to
operate
and
of
course
and
that
was
part
of
the
application
and
you
have
decided
disadvantages
of
congestion
and
the
disruption
of
the
operations
of
that
small
railroad.
mr.
fritz
r.
kahn
no,
i
meant
by
that
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
track
simply
is
not
incapable
of
sustaining
the
operations
of
four
railroads.
