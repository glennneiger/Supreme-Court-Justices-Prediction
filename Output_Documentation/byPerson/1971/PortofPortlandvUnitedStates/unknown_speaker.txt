unknown
speaker
i
am
trying
to
(inaudible)
on
your
map.
unknown
speaker
i
am
lost
on
peninsula
terminal.
it
is
up
here
in
the
corner.
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
see
it
now.
one
another
question
that
i
have
interrupted
you,
now
where
is
the
milwaukee
to
come
in
on
this?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
and
on
the
left
they
are
entirely
using
that
trackage,
are
they
not?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
tatum,
if
you
prevailed
here,
would
this
be
a
precedent
with
respect
to
any
other
industrial
development
wherever
instituted?
unknown
speaker
well
suppose
this
was
not
the
case
here,
one
railroad
was
into
the
middle
in
creating
the
industrial
development,
would
it
have
to
share
it
then
with
everybody
else?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
on
the
other
side
of
the
question
then.
i
take
it
that
rivergate
was
very
little
developed
if
at
all
at
the
time
of
the
northern
lines
agreement?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
if
it
had
been
brought
along
four
or
five
years
further
at
its
development
at
that
time,
it
would
have
been
taken
into
consideration
then
in
the
northern
lines
development
agreement?
unknown
speaker
will
you
then
making
same
argument
i
suppose
that
milwaukee
and
the
northern
owned
jointly
that
trackage
in
three
days?
unknown
speaker
you
would
be
making
the
same
argument
that
it
is
entitled
to
jointly
own
the
peninsula?
unknown
speaker
but
is
peninsula
not
obligated
as
a
common
carrier
to
serve
milwaukee
like
any
other
road
at
the
same
rate?
unknown
speaker
so
they
could
get
in
there
if
--
so
they
can
get
the
switching
service
to
get
into
rivergate
from
peninsula?
unknown
speaker
at
the
same
rates
as
anybody
else?
unknown
speaker
well
then
--
unknown
speaker
--
what
is
the
importance
of
the
joint
ownership?
unknown
speaker
i
know
it,
but
what
if
it
is
passable
railroad
that
sharing
the
profit.
that
is
the
sure.
unknown
speaker
let
us
talk
or
let
us
assume
that
the
northern
and
the
milwaukee
jointly
owned
the
track
in
3
to
8,
then
you
would
still
be
making
the
same
argument
about
jointly
owning.
unknown
speaker
i
know
but,
does
it
not
have
to
have
the
equal
terms
with
everybody?
unknown
speaker
you
are
talking
about
the
stock
ownership?
unknown
speaker
the
commission
went
further
than
that
on
its
decision.
unknown
speaker
only
the
stock
ownership
is
involved?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
argument
that
held
that
it
is
not
so
it
is,
but
has
to
be
in
agreement
upon
a
division
first.
unknown
speaker
does
it
pay
the
switching
charges?
unknown
speaker
they
must
have
had
a
reason.
it
was
only
the
profits
they
might
realized?
is
that
the
reason
they
want
to
invest?
unknown
speaker
was
there
oral
argument
before
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
any
reasons
why
they
did
not
write
an
opinion?
unknown
speaker
i
am
trying
to
(inaudible)
on
your
map.
unknown
speaker
i
am
lost
on
peninsula
