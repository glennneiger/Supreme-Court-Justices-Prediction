justice
byron
r.
white
now,
why
did
milwaukee
happen
to
have
a
piece
of
peninsula's
order
to
get
into
the
rivergate?
does
not
the
right
to
use
the
sp&s
trackage
given
access
to
rivergate
over
peninsula
terminal?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
therefore
no
right
to
use
those
tracks?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
under
the
decision,
under
the
merger
proposal,
they
do
not
have
the
right
to
come
in
on,
say,
the
burlington
northern?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
from
hoyt
yard
down
here
three
--
they
do
not
--
can
they
get
trackage
rights
overburlington
northern
and
come
up
something
near
to
the
peninsula?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
from
point
3
on
the
burlington
northern
all
the
way
to
point
8,
milwaukee
has
no
rights
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that
is
not
there.
i
gather
that
is
not
exactly
what
your
opponent
says
so.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
alright
go
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
i
think
what
you
are
saying
is
that
it
will
cost
--
because
the
joint
ownership
of
the
union
pacific
and
northern,
it
may
cost
to
milwaukee
more
to
get
that
switching
service
than
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
we
have
it,
but
that
is
not
--
it
is
only
online
at
the
sense
that
they
jointly
own
another
railroad
company.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
am
sorry.
i
am
sorry.
justice
byron
r.
white
at
this
map
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
if
the
union
pacific
and
the
burlington
northern
apply
for
the
trackage
rights,
it
maybe
the
peninsula's
incline
to
oppose
it
during
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
that
is
right
too,
i
gather
that
if
the
milwaukee
applies
for
the
trackage
rights,
it
may
well
be
that
peninsula
will
oppose
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
and
may
not
be
my
question
in
light
of
condition
24.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
is
that
not
intended
to
get
milwaukee
into
this
port
initially?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
but
if
they
cut
out
--
if
they
were
not
allowed
rights
over
peninsula
tracks,
speaking
for
that
of
the
burlington
northern
and
union
pacific,
would
that
not
be
questionable
under
condition
24?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
commission's
approach
here?
this
was
an
agreement
that
had
to
be
approved
by
the
commission.
justice
byron
r.
white
no
i
mean
the
purchase
of
the
peninsula
by
the
two
railroads.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
is
it
commission’s
approach
that
well
we
have
to
approve
that
unless
there
is
something
illegal
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
contrary
to
the
public
interest
in
letting
the
milwaukee
have
a
share?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
reason
the
commission
decided
against
the
milwaukee?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
profits?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
the
profits
are
right
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
gather
though
that
you
were
telling
there
are
not
going
to
be
profits
for
peninsula
anyway,
and
that
it
is
a
swampy
railroad
that
cannot
carry
any
traffic
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
they
also
wanted
to
be
in
the
position
to
control
whether
or
not
peninsula
is
going
to
rebuild
or
expand.
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
but
that
is
just
all
the
way
another
possible
entry
into
rivergate.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
maybe
true
but
this
is
still
of
third
entry
that
they
can
decide
whether
or
not
to
spend
their
money
to
make
peninsula
an
effective
entry
way
or
gateway
of
the
rivergate.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
now,
why
should
milwaukee
not
have
a
share
of
that
decision
making?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
anyone
ask
to
three-judge
court
if
they
came
down
with
that
order
for
re-hearing
in
an
opinion
or
something?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
gather
that
two
of
them
are
retired
already.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
why
did
milwaukee
happen
to
have
a
