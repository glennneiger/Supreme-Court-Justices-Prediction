mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case
the
district
court
on
jurisdictional
grounds
dismissed
the
complaint
filed
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
denied
the
board's
motion
for
a
preliminary
injunction.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
judgment
in
all
respects.
there
is
no
decision
here
on
the
merits
of
the
board's
claim
and
there
has
been
no
findings
of
fact
on
which
a
decision
on
the
merits
would
ordinarily
be
predicated.
the
decision
was
made
is
on
the
complaint
and
on
the
motion
for
the
injunction.
the
complaint
is
set
forth
beginning
at
page
four
of
the
appendix.
in
it
the
board
recites
that
unfair
labor
practice
charges
had
been
filed
with
the
board
by
the
union
which
is
appearing
here
as
amicus,
the
amount
to
made
meat
cutters
union
against
the
respondent
company
that
on
the
basis
of
this
charge,
a
trial
examiner
of
the
board
had
found
that
the
company
had
violated
the
national
labor
relations
act
in
several
respects
by
wrongfully
refusing
to
bargain
with
the
union
and
by
committing
another
unfair
labor
practices
relating
to
the
union's
organizational
campaign.
i
should
say
incidentally
that
after
the
present
suit
was
filed
as
the
briefs
point
out,
the
board
in
ruling
on
the
company's
exceptions
disagreed
with
the
hearing
examiner,
concerning
their
refusal
to
bargain
and
held
that
the
board
--
that
the
union
had
not
established
majority
status,
but
the
board
did
agree
that
the
company
had
committed
certain
and
other
unfair
labor
practices
and
issued
a
cease
and
desist
order
for
which
the
company
has
complied
and
there
is
no
question
here
about
enforcement
of
the
board’s
order.
the
complaint
further
recited
that
approximately
one
month
after
the
issuance
of
the
hearing
examiner's
decision,
employees
of
the
company
began
to
picket
the
company
stores
and
the
company
ran
into
the
state
court
and
obtained
an
injunction
against
the
picketing.
the
copy
of
the
injunction
was
amended
as
an
exhibit
to
the
board's
complaint.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
this
is
strictly
a
question
of
whether
there
is
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court
to
hear
the
board's
complaint
for
an
injunction
against
enforcement
of
the
state
court's
injunction
by
the
company.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
our
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
we
have
asked
to
have
the
case
remanded
for
a
hearing
on
the
merits
of
the
board's
complaint.
well,
only
the
jurisdictional
question
has
been
decided
below.
we
do
not
think
the
case
is
ripe
for
adjudication
on
the
merits
whether
the
injunction
should
issue;
there
has
been
no
factual
finding.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
question
is
very
closely
related
to
the
question
that
divided
court
in
the
ariadne
case
in
397
u.s.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
under
the
complaint
in
accordance
with
the
majority
opinion
ariadne.
the
compliant
was
put
in
terms
of
the
activities
being
arguably
protected
or
arguably
prohibited.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
understand
that
to
be
the
law
under
guidance
and
related
cases
through
ariadne.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
that
is
what
we
understand
the
law
should
be
mr.
justice.
and
there
is
no
occasion
at
this
stage,
that
the
present
case
to
reach
that
issue
because
under
either
view
taken
in
ariadne,
we
think
saying
this
position
would
be
appropriate
here.
now,
in
a
prayer
for
relief
the
board
was
quite
specific
in
stating
that
it
wished
to
have
enjoin
the
enforcement
of
those
portions
of
the
state
court
injunction
that
were
within
the
preempted
area
in
the
board's
view
and
those
portions
are
more
specifically
set
out
in
the
board's
motion
for
a
preliminary
injunction
which
is
set
forth
in
the
appendix
on
pages
33
and
34
of
our
appendix.
there
is
quotation
or
portions
of
the
injunction
which
the
board
seeks
to
have
the
enforcement
of
enjoined
and
there
are
several
ellipsis
in
the
quoted
portions
numbered
one,
two
and
three.
the
first
occurred
at
the
beginning
of
the
part
two
and
then
some
parts
a
and
b
of
part
two
are
omitted
and
then
there
is
another
ellipsis
in
part
three.
these
ellipsis
are
those
parts
of
the
order
referring
to
the
blocking
of
egress
or
ingress
to
the
premises
of
the
company
to
interference
with
the
flow
of
traffic
or
the
stationing
of
more
than
two
pickets
at
anyone
store
owned
by
the
company.
so
there
has
been
no
attempt
here
to
oust
the
state
court
of
jurisdiction,
like
you
are
entirely
supersede
the
state
court’s
injunction
and
no
where
in
the
prior
for
relief
is
there
any
contention
raised
that
the
state
statutes
are
unconstitutional
under
the
first
amendment
or
under
any
other
provision.
there
is
no
declaratory
judgment
about
the
constitutionality
of
state
statutes
sought,
nor
any
broad
injunction
against
enforcement
of
the
state
statutes.
those
issues
that
are
mooted
in
amicus
briefs
in
this
court
in
case
with
a
suggestion
that
the
abstention
doctrine
might
come
into
play
before
a
federal
court
should
involve
itself
in
that
question,
but
the
question
has
not
been
put
before
the
district
court
in
the
complaint
or
in
the
motion
for
a
preliminary
injunction
and
the
question
is
not
here
as
we
see
the
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
have
emphasized
in
our
brief
that
we
think
cases
concerning
private
litigation
between
private
parties
stand
aside
from
the
issue
here
which
is
the
issue
under
the
leiter
mineral
doctrine.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
might
well
control
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
do
not
believe
the
younger
case
would
be
the
most
closely
in
point.
i
think
the
richman
brothers
case,
it
would
be
more
closely
in
point.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
am
unfamiliar
with
that
case,
your
honor?
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
that
is
very
accurately
stated
your
honor.
there
is
no
dispute
by
anyone
in
this
case
is
that
if
the
suit
had
been
brought
in
the
name
of
the
united
states,
the
leiter
minerals
case
would
be
controlling
and
i
think
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
read
the
leiter
minerals
case
any
other
way.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
my
understanding.
in
fact,
the
only
qualification
of
leiter
minerals
withstands
that
is
raised
in
the
whole
of
case
is
in
our
brief
in
which
we
point
out
that
when
the
united
states
is
pursuing
not
to
protect
the
public
interest
but
in
pursued
only
of
a
private
entrance
that
it
had
a
duty
to
pursue,
the
court
has
refused
to
extend
the
leiter
minerals
exception
to
that
kind
of
case.
that
present
case
is
not
that
kind
of
case.
i
do
not
think
we
need
concern
ourselves
here
with
that
kind
of
case
but
that
is
the
only
qualification
on
the
doctrine
that
has
been
raised
in
the
brief
and
the
issue
between
us
is
whether
the
doctrine
is
more
accurately
characterized
as
we
like
to
characterize
it,
as
the
governmental
exception
of
the
section
2283
or
whether
it
applies
only
when
suit
is
brought
in
the
name
of
the
united
states.
we
do
not
rely
on
any
of
the
express
exceptions
in
section
2283.
we
find
ourselves
unable
to
in
face
the
court's
holdings
about
the
narrow
scope
of
those
exceptions.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
in
richman
brothers
and
it
is
more
recently
in
the
atlantic
coast
line
case.
there
has
been
no
challenge
before
the
board
concerning
this
picketing
and
the
board
has
clearly
held
that
the
filing
of
a
state
suit
in
good
faith
to
invoke
remedies
under
a
state
statute
is
not
unfairly
for
practice.
it
is
not
within
the
scope
of
the
board’s
jurisdiction
to
question.
so
the
issue
comes
down
to
whether
the
leiter
minerals
exception
and
i
do
want
to
point
out
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
did
argue
them.
the
board
argued
them
in
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
at
least
abandoned
the
argument
in
this
court.
the
argument
was
rejected.
it
was
made
as
an
alternative
argument.
now,
i
do
want
to
point
out
that
the
holding
of
leiter
minerals
on
this
point
seems
to
us
clear
and
concise.
it
is
set
forth
on
page
23
of
our
brief
and
after
the
policies
behind
that
are
summarized
by
the
court.
the
holding
is
stated
really
in
a
single
part
of
the
sentence
that
we
had
at
the
end
of
quotation.
the
interpretation
excluding
the
united
states
in
the
coverage
of
the
statute
seems
to
us
preferable
in
the
context
of
healthy
federal
state
relations.
immediately
after
that
sentence
in
leiter
minerals,
a
new
paragraph
begins
with
the
word
that
the
court
will
then
turn
to
the
merits
of
the
question.
the
question
still
remains
whether
the
granting
of
an
injunction
was
proper
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
any
discussion
in
the
opinion
relating
to
the
particular
facts
of
leiter
followed
that
statement
by
the
court.
the
interpretation
of
2283
on
the
jurisdictional
question
was
the
simple
interpretation,
that
the
united
states
has
excluded
from
the
coverage
of
the
statute.
that
interpretation
is
now
unchanged
by
congress
for
14
years.
now,
it
is
frankly
difficult
perhaps
to
think
of
reasons
why
it
should
make
a
difference
in
terms
the
purposes
of
section
2283
or
the
rational
of
any
of
these
cases.
why
it
should
make
a
difference
whether
the
suit
is
brought
in
the
name
of
the
united
states
or
in
the
name
of
a
particular
agency?
a
recent
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
seems
to
us
to
illustrate
this
very
well
and
we
referred
in
our
brief
on
page
25,
note
11
to
the
litigation
that
was
then
pending
which
has
now
been
decided
by
both
of
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
a
case
called
the
united
states
against
city
of
new
haven.
in
that
case
a
state
court
injunction
had
been
obtained
against
the
use
of
a
particular
runway
in
the
new
haven
airport,
that
federal
aviation
administration,
of
course
has
jurisdiction
over
the
safety
of
airports
and
the
provision
of
airport
services
and
it
is
part
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
government.
it
is
now
part
of
the
department
of
transportation.
the
justice
department
in
its
behalf
filed
suit
in
the
federal
district
court
to
enjoin
the
enforcement
of
that
state
court
injunction
as
having
invaded
an
area
within
the
province
of
the
federal
regulatory
scheme.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
different
in
that
and
it
does
not
have
statutory
authority
to
bring
suit
in
its
own
name,
that
is
the
difference.
it
is
hard
to
see
any
other
difference
as
i
am
about
to
point
out.
the
suit
was
brought
and
the
district
court
upheld
the
jurisdiction
within
leiter
minerals
and
issued
to
preliminary
injunction
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
recently
affirmed
the
granting
of
the
preliminary
injunction
on
a
case
decided
august
31,
1971,
docket
number
71-1669,
it
is
called
united
states
against
the
city
of
new
haven.
now,
it
seems
for
purposes
of
the
statutory
policy
in
section
2283,
new
haven
stands
that
the
federal
aviation
administration
is
not
empowered
to
sue
in
its
own
name,
sue
within
the
name
of
the
united
states,
yet
other
agencies
which
has
very
comparable
responsibilities
for
the
provision
of
the
services
to
the
public,
such
as
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
federal
power
commission,
the
federal
communications
commission,
do
have
statutory
authority
to
sue
in
their
own
name,
would
be
implementing
federal
policies
and
interference
with
federal
policies
by
bringing
entirely
comparable
suits.
it
is
hard
to
think
of
any
reason
why
they
should
be
a
difference
should
result
on
the
jurisdictional
ground
under
section
2283.
now,
this
does
not
mean
that
a
host
of
new
cases,
a
large
volume
of
additional
litigation
would
be
opening
up
as
a
result
recognition
of
the
scope
of
the
governmental
exception.
it
seems
to
us
that
it
was
recognized
a
while
ago
in
bowles
against
willingham
for
that
matter.
there
had
been
establishment
of
it
under
the
office
of
price
administration
legislation.
it
is
true
that
the
opinion
in
that
case
pointed
to
statutory
authority
for
the
administrator
to
seek
injunction,
that
statutory
authority
did
not
specify
that
injunctions
could
be
sought
against
the
enforcement
of
state
court
judgment
and
it
is
really
not
significantly
different
from
the
statutory
authority
of
any
other
agencies
seek
injunction.
we
have
inquired
of
a
number
of
agencies
to
determine
what
their
experience
has
been
in
this
field
and
most
of
them
had
replied
that
they
cannot
recall
an
instance
in
which
they
had
to
seek
relief
against
a
state
court
judgment
where
they
could
not
at
least
attempt
to
justify
that
relief
or
within
the
rationale
of
the
express
exception
in
section
2283,
but
several
of
them
did
mention
to
us
that
such
cases
could
arise
that
would
very
important
to
the
administration
of
their
statute
and
for
that
reason
they
are
interested
in
the
outcome
of
this
litigation.
i
will
cite
just
one
instance.
the
federal
trade
commission
and
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
both
pointed
out
to
us
that
under
certain
statutory
provisions
they
have
an
obligation
to
conduct
an
investigation
from
secret
and
to
keep
the
matters
that
they
investigate
confidential
and
they
would
be
concerned
about
possible
disclosure
of
some
these
matters
in
state
court
proceeding
and
would
be
rather
hard
pressed
to
justify
relief
under
the
express
exception
to
2283
in
such
a
circumstance,
it
has
not
yet
arisen,
but
it
could
arise.
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
points
out
its
particular
concern
because
of
the
statutory
policy
behind
the
confidentiality
of
their
investigation,
a
policy
of
protecting
complainants
and
witnesses
against
reprieved
or
intimidation
and
the
like.
so
there
are
some
important
policies
involved
here.
further
more
in
light
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
now
would
know
a
specific
statutory
exemption.
i
did
not
think
the
terms
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
complied
with
the
board.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
an
important
thing
in
court
order
and
this
is
not
a
proceeding
brought
under
that
provision.
of
course
that
is
in
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
an
issue
that
i
do
not
think
need
be
reached
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
there
is
initially
a
serious
question
whether
norris-laguardia
would
have
any
applicability
to
an
injunction
against
just
an
enforcement
of
the
state
court
judgment
rather
than
an
injunction
that
goes
to
the
conduct
of
the
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
is.
but
it
is
a
very
limited
scope
of
an
injunction.
it
does
not
seem
to
me
to
be
the
kind
of
interference
with
the
settlement
of
labor
disputes
that
norris-laguardia
would
concern
with.
indeed
this
kind
of
injunction
seems
to
have
the
policies
of
norris-laguardia
by
presenting
state
court
interference
with
the
equal
settlement
of
labor
dispute.
well,
i
think
one
other
statutory
position
might
be
pointed
out
as
an
example
of
the
immateriality
even
to
congress
of
this
distinction
and
that
is
a
provision
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
which
is
a
particular
provision
and
is
entitled
49
of
the
code,
section
16,
sub
section
12,
entitled
proceedings
to
enforce
orders
other
than
for
payment
of
money
and
there
the
statute
provides
if
any
carrier
fails
or
neglects
to
obey
any
order
of
the
commission
other
than
for
the
payment
of
money
while
the
order
is
in
effect,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
or
any
party
entered
thereby
or
the
united
states
by
its
attorney
general
may
apply
to
any
district
court
of
the
united
states
for
the
enforcement
of
the
order,
a
district
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
and
so
that
is
just
an
example
of
congress’
attitude
its
policies
and
its
statute
are
to
be
enforced
by
whoever
has
the
litigating
authority,
in
that
case
in
the
alternative
by
the
united
states
or
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
it
is
difficult
for
us
to
see
the
materiality
of
this
distinction.
now,
in
the
labor
relations
field
the
question
is
of
perhaps
a
greater
significance
and
will
or
has
produced
a
somewhat
larger
line
of
litigation
already.
the
board
informs
me
that
it
gets
about
a
dozen
complaints
a
year,
requests
that
it
files
suits
of
this
type.
it
has
on
the
average
been
filing
less
than
one
per
year
and
partly
of
course
because
of
doubts
about
of
the
outcome
of
this
issue,
but
also
because
it
selects
these
cases
carefully
and
plans
to
continue
to
do
so,
if
it
is
successful
in
this
litigation
which
seems
to
us
to
point
out
the
significant
difference
between
suits
brought
by
public
authority
to
vindicate
the
important
federal
policies
reflected
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
other
statutes
and
private
litigation
which
has
been
bared
under
2283
and
which
was
really
the
concern
of
congress
in
enacting
2283
and
its
predecessors.
the
difficulties
in
the
enforcement
of
the
policies
that
the
act
that
result
from
injunctions
of
the
type
issued
by
the
state
court
here,
we
think
are
manifest.
indeed
the
district
judge
himself
spelled
them
out
in
a
rather
regretful
paragraph
in
his
opinion
in
which
he
said
that
the
decision
leads
to
really
non-less
result
and
they
have
been
rehearsed
previously
in
opinions
of
this
court.
now,
the
question
remains
what
alternatives
would
be
open
to
the
board
with
not
able
to
secure
relief
in
the
fashion
it
is
seeking
here,
at
least
to
have
its
complaint
entertained.
other
than
leaving
the
matter
to
private
litigation
entirely
which
means
unsatisfactory,
it
might
add
responsibilities.
there
are
only
two
possibilities.
one
is
to
seek
to
intervene
or
to
participate
as
amicus
curiae
in
the
state
court
proceeding.
whether
it
could
intervene
since
no
order
of
the
board
is
at
issue
would
be
highly
questionable.
if
it
could
not
participate
as
a
party,
intervener
then
whether
an
appeal
would
be
taken
would
be
out
of
his
hand.
in
addition
even
if
it
could
participate,
it
would
be
subjected
to
the
possible
pitfalls
of
unfamiliar
state
procedure,
the
possible
limitations
of
state
discovery
proceedings
and
other
disadvantages
in
comparison
with
the
federal
forum
where
congress
contemplated
it
would
be
doing
is
litigating.
the
other
possible
alternative
is
the
suggestion
that
was
raised
in
the
court’s
opinion
in
richman
brothers
that
perhaps
the
filing
of
a
state
court
preceding
that
interferes
with
the
area
preempted
by
the
national
labor
relations
act
might
itself
be
an
unfair
labor
practice.
the
board,
and
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
has
careful
consideration,
rejected
this
position.
when
a
suit
is
brought
in
good
faith
in
a
state
court
to
invoke
remedies
provided
for
by
state
statute
and
it
seems
to
us
that
for
the
board
to
hold
that
good
faith
suit
and
such
circumstances
could
be
brought
only
if
the
risk
of
being
held
and
committed
an
unfair
labor
practice
would
be
a
far
greater
intrusion
on
the
prerogatives
of
the
state
and
the
dignity
of
state
procedures
to
prevent
even
the
invoking
in
good
faith
of
state
remedies
than
is
the
settled
interpretation
as
we
understand
it,
of
section
2283.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
just
like
to
say
a
word
or
two
about
some
of
the
cases
relied
on
by
the
respondent
figuring
nathanson
against
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
which
this
court
in
construing
the
bankruptcy
act
decided
that
an
award
of
back
pay
owing
to
the
labor
board
while
it
was
debt
owing
to
the
labor
board
was
functionally
in
the
category
of
wages
owing
to
work
rather
than
a
sum
of
money
owing
to
the
treasury
of
the
united
states
and
should
accordingly
be
awarded
the
priority
of
wages
rather
than
debts
owing
to
the
united
states
for
purposes
of
applying
the
bankruptcy
act.
it
is
hard
for
me
to
think
that
any
different
result
would
have
been
reached
in
that
case
had
the
debt
technically
been
owing
to
the
united
states
but
to
be
used
for
the
same
purpose.
the
reasoning
of
the
court
was
that
this
was
not
a
payment
to
go
into
the
federal
treasury.
reconstruction
of
finance
corporation
against
menihan
was
a
case
which
the
court
held
that
the
corporation
distinguished
from
federal
agency
which
had
statutory
authority
to
sue
and
be
sued
like
other
corporations
should
not
come
within
the
statutory
provision
exempting
the
united
states
from
interest
payment
in
litigation,
but
the
ordinary
rules
of
litigation
should
apply.
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
other
federal
agencies
were
for
years
operating
under
the
federal
provision
exempting
the
united
states
from
interest
payments.
so
we
are
not
paying
interest
in
litigation
and
it
is
only
since
the
amendment
of
that
provision
with
respect
to
all
litigation
by
the
united
states
that
practices
change
for
the
agency
in
that
respect.
now,
if
there
is
any
further
question
about
the
norris-laguardia
act
in
this
matter
i
am
informed
that
the
board
did
brief
the
question
of
why
the
norris-laguardia
act
should
not
apply
in
this
kind
of
case.
it
would
either
in
the
capital
service
case
or
in
the
richman
brothers’
case,
we
do
not
recall
which
brief
it
was
but
it
-
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
congress
took
that
precaution
and
those
provisions
all
relate
to
the
boards
authority
to
seek
relief
(voice
overlap)
that
applies
directly
to
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
the
difference
in
this
case
and
those
provisions
is
that
there
the
relief,
they
are
directly
on
the
rights
between
the
parties.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
is
hard
to
know
what
is
behind
the
precautionary
language
of
this
kind.
i
do
not
know.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
is
no
specific
reference
in
norris-laguardia
act.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
or
course.
the
concern
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
was
with
the
conjunction
(voice
overlaps)
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
need
not
argue
that
the
united
states
is
not
at
all
subject
to
the
norris-laguardia
act.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
but
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
but
if
the
board
is
not
at
all
subject
to
it
is
what
i
should
say
because
the
purpose
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
was
to
prevent
an
injunction
that
would
interfere
with
the
board's
activity
and
that
is
exactly
what
the
board
is
trying
to
prevent
in
this
case,
interference
with
the
board’s
function
under
the
act.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
--
well,
yes,
about
section
1337
of
title
xxviii.
thank
you.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case
the
district
court
on
jurisdictional
grounds
dismissed
the
complaint
filed
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
denied
the
board's
motion
for
a
preliminary
injunction.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
judgment
in
all
respects.
there
is
no
decision
here
on
the
merits
of
the
board's
claim
and
there
has
been
no
findings
of
fact
on
which
a
decision
on
the
merits
would
ordinarily
be
predicated.
the
decision
was
made
is
on
the
complaint
and
on
the
motion
for
the
injunction.
the
complaint
is
set
forth
beginning
at
page
four
of
the
appendix.
in
it
the
board
recites
that
unfair
labor
practice
charges
had
been
filed
with
the
board
by
the
union
which
is
appearing
here
as
amicus,
the
amount
to
made
meat
cutters
union
against
the
respondent
company
that
on
the
basis
of
this
charge,
a
trial
examiner
of
the
board
had
found
that
the
company
had
violated
the
national
labor
relations
act
in
several
respects
by
wrongfully
refusing
to
bargain
with
the
union
and
by
committing
another
unfair
labor
practices
relating
to
the
union's
organizational
campaign.
i
should
say
incidentally
that
after
the
present
suit
was
filed
as
the
briefs
point
out,
the
board
in
ruling
on
the
company's
exceptions
disagreed
with
the
hearing
examiner,
concerning
their
refusal
to
bargain
and
held
that
the
board
--
that
the
union
had
not
established
majority
status,
but
the
board
did
agree
that
the
company
had
committed
certain
and
other
unfair
labor
practices
and
issued
a
cease
and
desist
order
for
which
the
company
has
complied
and
there
is
no
question
here
about
enforcement
of
the
board’s
order.
the
complaint
further
recited
that
approximately
one
month
after
the
issuance
of
the
hearing
examiner's
decision,
employees
of
the
company
began
to
picket
the
company
stores
and
the
company
ran
into
the
state
court
and
obtained
an
injunction
against
the
picketing.
the
copy
of
the
injunction
was
amended
as
an
exhibit
to
the
board's
complaint.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
this
is
strictly
a
question
of
whether
there
is
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court
to
hear
the
board's
complaint
for
an
injunction
against
enforcement
of
the
state
court's
injunction
by
the
company.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
our
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
we
have
asked
to
have
the
case
remanded
for
a
hearing
on
the
merits
of
the
board's
complaint.
well,
only
the
jurisdictional
question
has
been
decided
below.
we
do
not
think
the
case
is
ripe
for
adjudication
on
the
merits
whether
the
injunction
should
issue;
there
has
been
no
factual
finding.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
question
is
very
closely
related
to
the
question
that
divided
court
in
the
ariadne
case
in
397
u.s.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
under
the
complaint
in
accordance
with
the
majority
opinion
ariadne.
the
compliant
was
put
in
terms
of
the
activities
being
arguably
protected
or
arguably
prohibited.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
understand
that
to
be
the
law
under
guidance
and
related
cases
through
ariadne.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
that
is
what
we
understand
the
law
should
be
mr.
justice.
and
there
is
no
occasion
at
this
stage,
that
the
present
case
to
reach
that
issue
because
under
either
view
taken
in
ariadne,
we
think
saying
this
position
would
be
appropriate
here.
now,
in
a
prayer
for
relief
the
board
was
quite
specific
in
stating
that
it
wished
to
have
enjoin
the
enforcement
of
those
portions
of
the
state
court
injunction
that
were
within
the
preempted
area
in
the
board's
view
and
those
portions
are
more
specifically
set
out
in
the
board's
motion
for
a
preliminary
injunction
which
is
set
forth
in
the
appendix
on
pages
33
and
34
of
our
appendix.
there
is
quotation
or
portions
of
the
injunction
which
the
board
seeks
to
have
the
enforcement
of
enjoined
and
there
are
several
ellipsis
in
the
quoted
portions
numbered
one,
two
and
three.
the
first
occurred
at
the
beginning
of
the
part
two
and
then
some
parts
a
and
b
of
part
two
are
omitted
and
then
there
is
another
ellipsis
in
part
three.
these
ellipsis
are
those
parts
of
the
order
referring
to
the
blocking
of
egress
or
ingress
to
the
premises
of
the
company
to
interference
with
the
flow
of
traffic
or
the
stationing
of
more
than
two
pickets
at
anyone
store
owned
by
the
company.
so
there
has
been
no
attempt
here
to
oust
the
state
court
of
jurisdiction,
like
you
are
entirely
supersede
the
state
court’s
injunction
and
no
where
in
the
prior
for
relief
is
there
any
contention
raised
that
the
state
statutes
are
unconstitutional
under
the
first
amendment
or
under
any
other
provision.
there
is
no
declaratory
judgment
about
the
constitutionality
of
state
statutes
sought,
nor
any
broad
injunction
against
enforcement
of
the
state
statutes.
those
issues
that
are
mooted
in
amicus
briefs
in
this
court
in
case
with
a
suggestion
that
the
abstention
doctrine
might
come
into
play
before
a
federal
court
should
involve
itself
in
that
question,
but
the
question
has
not
been
put
before
the
district
court
in
the
complaint
or
in
the
motion
for
a
preliminary
injunction
and
the
question
is
not
here
as
we
see
the
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
have
emphasized
in
our
brief
that
we
think
cases
concerning
private
litigation
between
private
parties
stand
aside
from
the
issue
here
which
is
the
issue
under
the
leiter
mineral
doctrine.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
might
well
control
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
do
not
believe
the
younger
case
would
be
the
most
closely
in
point.
i
think
the
richman
brothers
case,
it
would
be
more
closely
in
point.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
am
unfamiliar
with
that
case,
your
honor?
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
that
is
very
accurately
stated
your
honor.
there
is
no
dispute
by
anyone
in
this
case
is
that
if
the
suit
had
been
brought
in
the
name
of
the
united
states,
the
leiter
minerals
case
would
be
controlling
and
i
think
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
read
the
leiter
minerals
case
any
other
way.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
my
understanding.
in
fact,
the
only
qualification
of
leiter
minerals
withstands
that
is
raised
in
the
whole
of
case
is
in
our
brief
in
which
we
point
out
that
when
the
united
states
is
pursuing
not
to
protect
the
public
interest
but
in
pursued
only
of
a
private
entrance
that
it
had
a
duty
to
pursue,
the
court
has
refused
to
extend
the
leiter
minerals
exception
to
that
kind
of
case.
that
present
case
is
not
that
kind
of
case.
i
do
not
think
we
need
concern
ourselves
here
with
that
kind
of
case
but
that
is
the
only
qualification
on
the
doctrine
that
has
been
raised
in
the
brief
and
the
issue
between
us
is
whether
the
doctrine
is
more
accurately
characterized
as
we
like
to
characterize
it,
as
the
governmental
exception
of
the
section
2283
or
whether
it
applies
only
when
suit
is
brought
in
the
name
of
the
united
states.
we
do
not
rely
on
any
of
the
express
exceptions
in
section
2283.
we
find
ourselves
unable
to
in
face
the
court's
holdings
about
the
narrow
scope
of
those
exceptions.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
in
richman
brothers
and
it
is
more
recently
in
the
atlantic
coast
line
case.
there
has
been
no
challenge
before
the
board
concerning
this
picketing
and
the
board
has
clearly
held
that
the
filing
of
a
state
suit
in
good
faith
to
invoke
remedies
under
a
state
statute
is
not
unfairly
for
practice.
it
is
not
within
the
scope
of
the
board’s
jurisdiction
to
question.
so
the
issue
comes
down
to
whether
the
leiter
minerals
exception
and
i
do
want
to
point
out
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
did
argue
them.
the
board
argued
them
in
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
at
least
abandoned
the
argument
in
this
court.
the
argument
was
rejected.
it
was
made
as
an
alternative
argument.
now,
i
do
want
to
point
out
that
the
holding
of
leiter
minerals
on
this
point
seems
to
us
clear
and
concise.
it
is
set
forth
on
page
23
of
our
brief
and
after
the
policies
behind
that
are
summarized
by
the
court.
the
holding
is
stated
really
in
a
single
part
of
the
sentence
that
we
had
at
the
end
of
quotation.
the
interpretation
excluding
the
united
states
in
the
coverage
of
the
statute
seems
to
us
preferable
in
the
context
of
healthy
federal
state
relations.
immediately
after
that
sentence
in
leiter
minerals,
a
new
paragraph
begins
with
the
word
that
the
court
will
then
turn
to
the
merits
of
the
question.
the
question
still
remains
whether
the
granting
of
an
injunction
was
proper
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
any
discussion
in
the
opinion
relating
to
the
particular
facts
of
leiter
followed
that
statement
by
the
court.
the
interpretation
of
2283
on
the
jurisdictional
question
was
the
simple
interpretation,
that
the
united
states
has
excluded
from
the
coverage
of
the
statute.
that
interpretation
is
now
unchanged
by
congress
for
14
years.
now,
it
is
frankly
difficult
perhaps
to
think
of
reasons
why
it
should
make
a
difference
in
terms
the
purposes
of
section
2283
or
the
rational
of
any
of
these
cases.
why
it
should
make
a
difference
whether
the
suit
is
brought
in
the
name
of
the
united
states
or
in
the
name
of
a
particular
agency?
a
recent
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
seems
to
us
to
illustrate
this
very
well
and
we
referred
in
our
brief
on
page
25,
note
11
to
the
litigation
that
was
then
pending
which
has
now
been
decided
by
both
of
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
a
case
called
the
united
states
against
city
of
new
haven.
in
that
case
a
state
court
injunction
had
been
obtained
against
the
use
of
a
particular
runway
in
the
new
haven
airport,
that
federal
aviation
administration,
of
course
has
jurisdiction
over
the
safety
of
airports
and
the
provision
of
airport
services
and
it
is
part
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
government.
it
is
now
part
of
the
department
of
transportation.
the
justice
department
in
its
behalf
filed
suit
in
the
federal
district
court
to
enjoin
the
enforcement
of
that
state
court
injunction
as
having
invaded
an
area
within
the
province
of
the
federal
regulatory
scheme.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
different
in
that
and
it
does
not
have
statutory
authority
to
bring
suit
in
its
own
name,
that
is
the
difference.
it
is
hard
to
see
any
other
difference
as
i
am
about
to
point
out.
the
suit
was
brought
and
the
district
court
upheld
the
jurisdiction
within
leiter
minerals
and
issued
to
preliminary
injunction
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
recently
affirmed
the
granting
of
the
preliminary
injunction
on
a
case
decided
august
31,
1971,
docket
number
71-1669,
it
is
called
united
states
against
the
city
of
new
haven.
now,
it
seems
for
purposes
of
the
statutory
policy
in
section
2283,
new
haven
stands
that
the
federal
aviation
administration
is
not
empowered
to
sue
in
its
own
name,
sue
within
the
name
of
the
united
states,
yet
other
agencies
which
has
very
comparable
responsibilities
for
the
provision
of
the
services
to
the
public,
such
as
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
federal
power
commission,
the
federal
communications
commission,
do
have
statutory
authority
to
sue
in
their
own
name,
would
be
implementing
federal
policies
and
interference
with
federal
policies
by
bringing
entirely
comparable
suits.
it
is
hard
to
think
of
any
reason
why
they
should
be
a
difference
should
result
on
the
jurisdictional
ground
under
section
2283.
now,
this
does
not
mean
that
a
host
of
new
cases,
a
large
volume
of
additional
litigation
would
be
opening
up
as
a
result
recognition
of
the
scope
of
the
governmental
exception.
it
seems
to
us
that
it
was
recognized
a
while
ago
in
bowles
against
willingham
for
that
matter.
there
had
been
establishment
of
it
under
the
office
of
price
administration
legislation.
it
is
true
that
the
opinion
in
that
case
pointed
to
statutory
authority
for
the
administrator
to
seek
injunction,
that
statutory
authority
did
not
specify
that
injunctions
could
be
sought
against
the
enforcement
of
state
court
judgment
and
it
is
really
not
significantly
different
from
the
statutory
authority
of
any
other
agencies
seek
injunction.
we
have
inquired
of
a
number
of
agencies
to
determine
what
their
experience
has
been
in
this
field
and
most
of
them
had
replied
that
they
cannot
recall
an
instance
in
which
they
had
to
seek
relief
against
a
state
court
judgment
where
they
could
not
at
least
attempt
to
justify
that
relief
or
within
the
rationale
of
the
express
exception
in
section
2283,
but
several
of
them
did
mention
to
us
that
such
cases
could
arise
that
would
very
important
to
the
administration
of
their
statute
and
for
that
reason
they
are
interested
in
the
outcome
of
this
litigation.
i
will
cite
just
one
instance.
the
federal
trade
commission
and
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
both
pointed
out
to
us
that
under
certain
statutory
provisions
they
have
an
obligation
to
conduct
an
investigation
from
secret
and
to
keep
the
matters
that
they
investigate
confidential
and
they
would
be
concerned
about
possible
disclosure
of
some
these
matters
in
state
court
proceeding
and
would
be
rather
hard
pressed
to
justify
relief
under
the
express
exception
to
2283
in
such
a
circumstance,
it
has
not
yet
arisen,
but
it
could
arise.
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
points
out
its
particular
concern
because
of
the
statutory
policy
behind
the
confidentiality
of
their
investigation,
a
policy
of
protecting
complainants
and
witnesses
against
reprieved
or
intimidation
and
the
like.
so
there
are
some
important
policies
involved
here.
further
more
in
light
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
now
would
know
a
specific
statutory
exemption.
i
did
not
think
the
terms
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
complied
with
the
board.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
an
important
thing
in
court
order
and
this
is
not
a
proceeding
brought
under
that
provision.
of
course
that
is
in
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
an
issue
that
i
do
not
think
need
be
reached
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
there
is
initially
a
serious
question
whether
norris-laguardia
would
have
any
applicability
to
an
injunction
against
just
an
enforcement
of
the
state
court
judgment
rather
than
an
injunction
that
goes
to
the
conduct
of
the
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
is.
but
it
is
a
very
limited
scope
of
an
injunction.
it
does
not
seem
to
me
to
be
the
kind
of
interference
with
the
settlement
of
labor
disputes
that
norris-laguardia
would
concern
with.
indeed
this
kind
of
injunction
seems
to
have
the
policies
of
norris-laguardia
by
presenting
state
court
interference
with
the
equal
settlement
of
labor
dispute.
well,
i
think
one
other
statutory
position
might
be
pointed
out
as
an
example
of
the
immateriality
even
to
congress
of
this
distinction
and
that
is
a
provision
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
which
is
a
particular
provision
and
is
entitled
49
of
the
code,
section
16,
sub
section
12,
entitled
proceedings
to
enforce
orders
other
than
for
payment
of
money
and
there
the
statute
provides
if
any
carrier
fails
or
neglects
to
obey
any
order
of
the
commission
other
than
for
the
payment
of
money
while
the
order
is
in
effect,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
or
any
party
entered
thereby
or
the
united
states
by
its
attorney
general
may
apply
to
any
district
court
of
the
united
states
for
the
enforcement
of
the
order,
a
district
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
and
so
that
is
just
an
example
of
congress’
attitude
its
policies
and
its
statute
are
to
be
enforced
by
whoever
has
the
litigating
authority,
in
that
case
in
the
alternative
by
the
united
states
or
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
it
is
difficult
for
us
to
see
the
materiality
of
this
distinction.
now,
in
the
labor
relations
field
the
question
is
of
perhaps
a
greater
significance
and
will
or
has
produced
a
somewhat
larger
line
of
litigation
already.
the
board
informs
me
that
it
gets
about
a
dozen
complaints
a
year,
requests
that
it
files
suits
of
this
type.
it
has
on
the
average
been
filing
less
than
one
per
year
and
partly
of
course
because
of
doubts
about
of
the
outcome
of
this
issue,
but
also
because
it
selects
these
cases
carefully
and
plans
to
continue
to
do
so,
if
it
is
successful
in
this
litigation
which
seems
to
us
to
point
out
the
significant
difference
between
suits
brought
by
public
authority
to
vindicate
the
important
federal
policies
reflected
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
other
statutes
and
private
litigation
which
has
been
bared
under
2283
and
which
was
really
the
concern
of
congress
in
enacting
2283
and
its
predecessors.
the
difficulties
in
the
enforcement
of
the
policies
that
the
act
that
result
from
injunctions
of
the
type
issued
by
the
state
court
here,
we
think
are
manifest.
indeed
the
district
judge
himself
spelled
them
out
in
a
rather
regretful
paragraph
in
his
opinion
in
which
he
said
that
the
decision
leads
to
really
non-less
result
and
they
have
been
rehearsed
previously
in
opinions
of
this
court.
now,
the
question
remains
what
alternatives
would
be
open
to
the
board
with
not
able
to
secure
relief
in
the
fashion
it
is
seeking
here,
at
least
to
have
its
complaint
entertained.
other
than
leaving
the
matter
to
private
litigation
entirely
which
means
unsatisfactory,
it
might
add
responsibilities.
there
are
only
two
possibilities.
one
is
to
seek
to
intervene
or
to
participate
as
amicus
curiae
in
the
state
court
proceeding.
whether
it
could
intervene
since
no
order
of
the
board
is
at
issue
would
be
highly
questionable.
if
it
could
not
participate
as
a
party,
intervener
then
whether
an
appeal
would
be
taken
would
be
out
of
his
hand.
in
addition
even
if
it
could
participate,
it
would
be
subjected
to
the
possible
pitfalls
of
unfamiliar
state
procedure,
the
possible
limitations
of
state
discovery
proceedings
and
other
disadvantages
in
comparison
with
the
federal
forum
where
congress
contemplated
it
would
be
doing
is
litigating.
the
other
possible
alternative
is
the
suggestion
that
was
raised
in
the
court’s
opinion
in
richman
brothers
that
perhaps
the
filing
of
a
state
court
preceding
that
interferes
with
the
area
preempted
by
the
national
labor
relations
act
might
itself
be
an
unfair
labor
practice.
the
board,
and
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
has
careful
consideration,
rejected
this
position.
when
a
suit
is
brought
in
good
faith
in
a
state
court
to
invoke
remedies
provided
for
by
state
statute
and
it
seems
to
us
that
for
the
board
to
hold
that
good
faith
suit
and
such
circumstances
could
be
brought
only
if
the
risk
of
being
held
and
committed
an
unfair
labor
practice
would
be
a
far
greater
intrusion
on
the
prerogatives
of
the
state
and
the
dignity
of
state
procedures
to
prevent
even
the
invoking
in
good
faith
of
state
remedies
than
is
the
settled
interpretation
as
we
understand
it,
of
section
2283.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
just
like
to
say
a
word
or
two
about
some
of
the
cases
relied
on
by
the
respondent
figuring
nathanson
against
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
which
this
court
in
construing
the
bankruptcy
act
decided
that
an
award
of
back
pay
owing
to
the
labor
board
while
it
was
debt
owing
to
the
labor
board
was
functionally
in
the
category
of
wages
owing
to
work
rather
than
a
sum
of
money
owing
to
the
treasury
of
the
united
states
and
should
accordingly
be
awarded
the
priority
of
wages
rather
than
debts
owing
to
the
united
states
for
purposes
of
applying
the
bankruptcy
act.
it
is
hard
for
me
to
think
that
any
different
result
would
have
been
reached
in
that
case
had
the
debt
technically
been
owing
to
the
united
states
but
to
be
used
for
the
same
purpose.
the
reasoning
of
the
court
was
that
this
was
not
a
payment
to
go
into
the
federal
treasury.
reconstruction
of
finance
corporation
against
menihan
was
a
case
which
the
court
held
that
the
corporation
distinguished
from
federal
agency
which
had
statutory
authority
to
sue
and
be
sued
like
other
corporations
should
not
come
within
the
statutory
provision
exempting
the
united
states
from
interest
payment
in
litigation,
but
the
ordinary
rules
of
litigation
should
apply.
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
other
federal
agencies
were
for
years
operating
under
the
federal
provision
exempting
the
united
states
from
interest
payments.
so
we
are
not
paying
interest
in
litigation
and
it
is
only
since
the
amendment
of
that
provision
with
respect
to
all
litigation
by
the
united
states
that
practices
change
for
the
agency
in
that
respect.
now,
if
there
is
any
further
question
about
the
norris-laguardia
act
in
this
matter
i
am
informed
that
the
board
did
brief
the
question
of
why
the
norris-laguardia
act
should
not
apply
in
this
kind
of
case.
it
would
either
in
the
capital
service
case
or
in
the
richman
brothers’
case,
we
do
not
recall
which
brief
it
was
but
it
-
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
congress
took
that
precaution
and
those
provisions
all
relate
to
the
boards
authority
to
seek
relief
(voice
overlap)
that
applies
directly
to
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
the
difference
in
this
case
and
those
provisions
is
that
there
the
relief,
they
are
directly
on
the
rights
between
the
parties.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
is
hard
to
know
what
is
behind
the
precautionary
language
of
this
kind.
i
do
not
know.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
is
no
specific
reference
in
norris-laguardia
act.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
or
course.
the
concern
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
was
with
the
conjunction
(voice
overlaps)
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
need
not
argue
that
the
united
states
is
not
at
all
subject
to
the
norris-laguardia
act.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
but
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
but
if
the
board
is
not
at
all
subject
to
it
is
what
i
should
say
because
the
purpose
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
was
to
prevent
an
injunction
that
would
interfere
with
the
board's
activity
and
that
is
exactly
what
the
board
is
trying
to
prevent
in
this
case,
interference
with
the
board’s
function
under
the
act.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
--
well,
yes,
about
section
1337
of
title
xxviii.
thank
you.
