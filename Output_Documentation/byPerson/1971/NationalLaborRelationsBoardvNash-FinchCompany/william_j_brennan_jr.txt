justice

mr.
wallace,
is
that
federal
aviation
administration
in
that
respect
different
from
the
nlrb?
it
is
the
plaintiff
in
this
statute
that
they
are
no
united
states,
does
that
mean?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
mr.
harding,
is
any
addition
there
on
the
issue
before
us,
namely
whether
there
was
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court
to
entertain
this
complaint?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
facts
that
you
are
telling
us
really
do
not
bear
on
that
question
of
board?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
wallace,
i
do
not
know
that
i
have
come
upon
all
of
them
but
there
appears
to
be
at
least
three
sections.
one
at
least
in
the
original
1935
act
and
two
in
the
1947
amendment,
where
congress
has
conferred
upon
the
board
authority
to
seek
injunctive
relief
where
it
has
added
something,
notwithstanding
any
other
provision
of
law
or
i
think
in
the
1935
act,
notwithstanding
the
provisions
of
101
to
115.
now,
do
you
think
that
there
is
some
significance
in
respect
to
whether
congress
thought
the
board
might
seek
injunctive
relief
and
the
fact
that
the
congress
at
least
in
those
three
instances
expressly
said
notwithstanding
any
argument
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what,
how
(voice

to
the
question
before
us?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
do
not
suggest
that
is
not
so,
but
might
there
not
be
an
inference
from
the
fact
that
at
least
three
times
congress
did
this?
that
congress
grew
up
and
accepts
as
they
did
it
that
the
board
was
not
to
be
considered
that
is
having
authority
to
seek
injunctive
relief
in
federal
court?
justice

(voice

of
course
the
answer
there
might
be
that
leiter
minerals
was
not
decided
until
1957
and
even
united
mine
workers
case
was,
330
u.s.
that
was
decided
after
1935
too.
so
you
might
--
that
might
explain
the
way
the
1935
reference
that
i
do
not.
it
seems
to
me
as
it;
it
is
more
difficult
to
explain
the
way
the
1947
reference.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
these
1947
references
are
not
norris-laguardia,
at
least
they
say
notwithstanding
any
other
provision
of
law.
