mr.
william
a.
harding
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
has
been
another
example
of
the
continual
failure
of
the
labor
board
to
acknowledge
that
the
congress
meant
what
it
said
when
it
passed
the
anti-injunction
statute
and
noted
that
federal
district
court
do
not
have
the
power,
indeed
they
are
prohibited
from
enjoining
the
state
court
proceedings
unless
specifically
in
aide
of
their
own
jurisdiction
in
order
to
effectuate
their
own
judgments
or
where
specifically
provided
for
by
congress.
of
course,
this
prohibition
and
these
exceptions
are
found
in
28
u.s.
code
2283
and
that
is
the
heart
and
basis
of
this
case.
mr.
william
a.
harding
yes,
your
honor,
but
that
was
not
so
much
that
they
do
not
mean
what
they
say.
they
had
not
said
enough
--
mr.
william
a.
harding
yes,
your
honor
and
i
would
like
to
explore
for
this
court
that
united
states
exception
that
the
board
talks
about
as
well
as
a
few
other
reasons
why
we
believe
this
court
should
affirm
the
decisions
of
the
lower
courts
in
denying
to
the
board
the
relief
it
requests.
but
before
i
do
so,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
a
few
facts,
the
board
took
care
not
to
emphasize
and
one
of
it
was
incorrect.
first,
the
board
incorrectly
noted
in
oral
argument
that
the
employees
of
the
nash-finch
company
were
striking
in
the
summer
of
1969.
this
is
incorrect
and
the
board’s
complaint
does
not
say.
the
board’s
complaint,
part
6,
noted
on
page
5
of
the
appendix
specifically
notes
that
the
union
began
picketing
and
as
noted
in
affidavits
passed
as
an
appendix
to
our
brief
in
support
of
our
petition
in
the
state
court
clearly
point
out
the
pickets
were
not
employees.
therefore,
it
was
understandable
that
the
company
would
not
have
easy
access
to
the
names
or
identity
of
those
people
and
that
the
state
court
therefore
required
that
anyone
that
was
being
presumably
paid
by
the
union
to
come
and
picket
with
first
come
to
the
state
court,
and
identify
themselves
and
submit
to
its
jurisdiction.
so
these
were
not
employees.
these
were
presumably
paid
union
personnel
that
were
conducting
picketing.
secondly
and
perhaps
most
importantly,
the
picketing
in
the
instant
case
is
acknowledged
and
judicially
has
been
determined
as
mass
picketing.
on
the
one
hand
we
will
have
peaceful
picketing
and
on
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum,
we
have
non-peaceful
picketing.
in
between
a
type
of
picketing
that
maybe
either
or
both
is
a
type
of
picketing
that
most
state
courts
attach
statutes
regarding
and
which
they
refer
to
as
mass
picketing.
in
implementing
its
duty
under
a
state
police
power
to
protect
the
rights
of
its
citizens
and
to
make
the
conclusion
that
they
may
not
be
hampered
by
any
type
of
picketing
that
would
prohibit
ingress
and
egress
or
lead
to
violence,
most
states
prohibit,
as
does
the
nebraska
statute,
the
numbers
of
pickets
that
maybe
placed
and
specifically
states
that
they
may
not
prohibit
the
ingress
and
egress.
the
nebraska
statute
has
few
other
factors
in
it
which
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
affidavits
which
we
have
submitted
in
the
state
court
which
are
set
forth
in
appendix
2
in
our
brief,
indicates
that
there
was
substantial
blocking
of
ingress
and
egress
by
these
non-employee
pickets.
that
there
were
substantially
more
than
the
numbers
allowed
by
the
state
statute.
there
were
also
some
other
areas
of
some
threats
to
both
customers
of
the
stores
or
store
employees
which
suffice
to
say
your
honors,
if
the
board
comes
before
this
court
or
rather
piously
proclaiming,
this
is
peaceful
picketing
and
it
is
not.
there
is
a
judicial
determination
that
it
is
mass
picketing
and
there
is
a
little
bit
difference.
because
if
it
is
peaceful
picketing
only
the
company
acknowledges
that
there
is
obviously
at
least
an
arguable,
at
least
an
arguable
conclusion
that
the
picketing
is
therefore,
totally,
completely
governed
by
the
national
liberations
act
and
the
board.
however,
if
it
is
mass
picketing
there
is
a
very
substantial
state
interest
involved
under
the
state
police
powers
and
that
is
what
we
have
at
issue
in
this
case,
your
honors
that
state
police
power
versus
what
the
board
would
ask
this
court
do
which
is
to
imply
to
it
an
exception
on
the
basis
of
federal
preemption.
so
that
it
may
go
into
any
federal
district
court
anywhere
in
the
country
and
get
an
injunction
of
any
state
implementing
this
peaceful
--
it
is
police
powers
as
regards
mass
picketing.
now,
we
also
note
in
our
brief
your
honors
that,
it
is
truly
we
have
never
had
any
holding
on
the
merits.
there
has
never
been
any
findings
of
fact
by
the
federal
district
court.
unfortunately,
we
were
not
really
in
a
position
to
be
vitally
concerned
about
this
since
we
already
had
our
judicial
determination
that
it
was
mass
picketing,
now
that
is
security
issue.
the
board
was
the
moving
party
in
the
federal
district
court
made
no
effort
to
place
any
of
those
facts
before
the
court
and
as
noted
in
oral
argument
the
case
was
determined
on
our
motion
to
dismiss
and
then
it
was
affirmed
by
the
eighth
circuit.
but
there
are
police
courts
or
police
department,
fire
department
records,
records
of
the
state
department
of
agriculture
which
we
note
in
our
brief
that
we
believe
this
court
could
take
judicial
notice
of
which
indicate
that
there
were
substantially
other
activities
that
could
properly
be
used
to
classify
this
picketing
as
violent.
there
were
--
mr.
william
a.
harding
no,
your
honors.
we
know
that
if
the
district
court
was
correct,
it
did
not
have
jurisdiction,
it
does
not
make
validity
--
mr.
william
a.
harding
no,
your
honor.
but
the
board
seems
to
make
that
view
because
the
board
says
that
they
should
have
an
exception
implied
for
them,
notwithstanding
the
united
states
exception.
our
argument
goes
on
to
say
we
feel
that
this
court
on
the
basis
of
federal
preemption
alone,
an
argument
which
was
rejected
by
this
court
both
in
the
richman
brothers’
case
and
last
year
at
atlantic
coast
line
on
the
basis
of
preemption
alone
it
should
allow
the
board
or
any
other
federal
agency
to
enter
the
district
court.
we
do
not
agree
with
that.
we
do
not
believe
this
court
does.
mr.
william
a.
harding
yes
your
honor,
if
it
was
peaceful
picketing
we
would
not
have
gone
into
state
court.
mr.
william
a.
harding
only
to
the
extent,
your
honor
that
the
board
has
made
this
as
a
basis
of
its
argument
before
this
court
as
to
why
it
should
have
had
jurisdiction
given
to
the
district
court
and
in
our
counter
argument
to
that
fact.
we
are
only
noting
that
if
this
court
should
consider
this
preemption
argument
of
the
board
that
it
should
also
consider
few
other
things
than
just
peaceful
picketing.
but
we
believe
the
issue
could
be
disposed
off
by
the
judicial
determination
in
the
state
court
that
this
was
mass
picketing,
not
peaceful
picketing.
mr.
william
a.
harding
perhaps,
your
honor
but
if
there
is
--
mr.
william
a.
harding
if
there
is
only
peaceful
picketing,
i
doubt
we
would
be
here.
mr.
william
a.
harding
i
realize
that
that
is
why
i
say
perhaps.
mr.
william
a.
harding
if
there
is
only
that
issue
involved
your
honor?
mr.
william
a.
harding
if
there
is
only
that
issue
involved
i
think
the
federal
district
court
might
have
felt
itself
quite
bothered
by
that
issue
but
i
think
--
i
think
the
--
mr.
william
a.
harding
my
position
is
your
honor
should
have
been
litigated
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
william
a.
harding
yes
sir.
mr.
william
a.
harding
i
do
not
believe
that
that
is
really
properly
before
this
court
or
i
have
--
in
further
answer
to
your
question
i
--
mr.
william
a.
harding
well,
the
reason
i
say
i
do
not
believe
it
is
properly
before
this
court
is
because
the
board
can
adequately
get
around
the
limitations
of
2283
and
it
could
have
and
should
have
proceeded
in
the
state
court
and
could
have
(inaudible)
its
problems
there.
there
are
number
of
reasons
why
we
believe
that
this
court
should
conclude
if
the
lower
court
was
correct
in
what
it
did,
i
would
like
to
first
draw
the
court’s
attention
to
the
statutory
framework
in
which
section
2283
appeared
to
the
district
court
as
is
denoted
by
this
court
in
previous
questions,
the
norris-laguardia
act
indicate
that
federal
district
courts
are
not
encouraged
to
grant
injunctive
relief
in
labor
matters.
29
u.s.
code,
sections
101
and
104
indicate
that
they
should
not.
in
fact
sections
107
and
109
indicate
that
they
should
make
detailed
findings
of
fact
before
they
would
ever
enter
such
scenario
granting
injunctive
relief.
but,
notwithstanding
that
fact,
29
u.s.
code,
section
160
usually
referred
to
as
sections
10
(j)
and
10
(l)
of
the
act
gives
to
the
labor
board
the
power
to
go
ahead
in
certain
situations
in
the
federal
district
court
and
obtain
injunctive
relief
if
they
feel
it
is
an
extraordinary
circumstance
where
they
should
exercise
that
power
and
go
in
and
get
that
injunction.
in
addition
to
that
of
course,
we
have
28
u.s.
code
2283
which
has
been
law
in
some
form
since
1793
and
i
submit
to
the
court,
your
honors
that
the
distinction
is
somewhat
more
basic
than
that
even
as
has
been
noted
in
the
amicus
brief
by
the
national
chamber
of
commerce
and
in
our
brief
that
this
has
been
a
long
standing
implementation
of
the
notion
in
congress
that
there
should
and
must
be
a
dual
court
system
in
this
country.
i
direct
your
honors’
attention
to
the
federalist
paper
number
46
which
we
note
in
our
brief
where
mr.
madison,
wherein
he
indicates
that
there
is
an
even
deeper
division
in
that
because
when
the
people
of
this
country
who
are
the
sovereign
gave
to
the
new
federal
government
its
power
to
do
what
they
allowed
it
to
do,
that
there
was
considerable
concern
over
what
that
federal
government
might
do
to
the
state
governments.
mr.
madison
notes
quite
clearly
at
number
46
that
if
there
is
an
area
where
a
state
court
infringes
on
an
area
that
the
federal
government
thinks
is
unfriendly
to
it,
did
notwithstanding
that
fact,
the
states
must
clearly
have
the
advantage.
and
reason
in
that
is
because
the
states
were
giving
the
power
to
the
federal
government
and
that
they
must
maintain
that
advantage.
and
so,
we
would
say
that
section
2283
came
before
the
district
court
with
a
very,
very
basic
distinction
between
the
federal
and
the
state
court
judicial
systems.
based
upon
that,
the
state
action
in
giving
the
company
relief
and
redress
under
the
state
mass
picketing
statute
is
certainly
not
before
this
court
on
the
grounds
that
that
is
not
within
their
power.
for
as
noted
in
numerous
decisions
before
this
court
as
set
out
in
our
brief
on
page
13,
this
court
has
many
times
noted
that
regulation
of
mass
picketing
by
state
courts
and
by
state
statute
is
clearly
and
completely
within
the
province
of
the
state
police
powers.
it
was
upon
this
statutory
framework
then
that
this
matter
reached
the
federal
district
court.
at
that
point
the
board
raised
its
two
arguments
that
it,
number
one
should
be
considered
the
united
states
for
the
purposes
of
this
action
and
get
around
section
2283
and
at
number
2
it
could
be
considered
to
get
around
section
2283
simply
because
it
had
been
established
by
the
congress.
i
suppose
they
base
it
on
a
very
large
federal
preemption
argument
on
this
issue.
mr.
william
a.
harding
well,
your
honor
a
number
of
cases,
wisconsin
--
the
wisconsin
cases,
the
allen
bradley
case
has
talked
about
that.
mr.
william
a.
harding
i
am
not
aware
that
it
did
your
honor.
this
court
noted
in
the
city
of
el
paso
case
in
1965
about
the
broad
powers
of
the
state
police
powers
that
the
state
should
be
granted
wide
discretion
in
determining
how
to
exercise
those
state
police
powers
and
mr.
justice
reed
in
ritter’s
café
in
1942
noted
specifically
that
there
was
no
serious
question
that
states
had
the
power
to
place
a
good
deal
of
regulation
on
mass
picketing
to
regulate
the
numbers
and
to
regulate
the
blocking
of
ingress,
egress,
etcetera.
the
basic
argument
that
the
labor
board
brings
before
this
court
that
it
should
be
considered
the
united
states
seems
to
have
been
decided
by
this
court’s
decision
in
the
nathanson
case
344
u.s.,
wherein
it
was
noted
that
a
debt
and
in
that
situation
a
back
pay
proceeding
that
was
owed
to
the
labor
board
was
not
entitled
to
preferences
of
debt
owed
to
the
united
states
would
be.
nevertheless,
this
case
is
still
before
the
court
because
the
board
maintains
that
it
should
be
considered
the
united
states
because
there
is
no
reason
to
consider
that
it
would
not
be.
but
your
honors
of
course,
it
is
recognized
that
the
federal
government
is
a
government
of
limited
of
powers.
it
is
also
a
government
of
specific
powers.
the
labor
board
was
established
not
to
be
the
united
states
for
all
intents
and
purposes
but
it
was
established
to
be
a
specific
agency
of
the
government
to
enforce
a
specific
statute
under
specific
policy
directives
of
the
congress.
i
do
not
believe
that
congress
intended
to
make
the
labor
board
into
what
might
be
referred
to
as
a
frankenstein’s
monster
and
that
it
could
go
across
the
entire
country
doing
what
it
would
like
and
considering
that
it
had
the
powers,
immunities
and
privileges
of
the
united
states.
indeed,
this
court
has
noted
previously
in
cases
very
similar
that
agencies
of
the
united
states
government
as
noted
in
the
menihan
case
which
we
note
in
our
brief
on
page
20,
page
23,
that
this
court
has
previously
concluded
that
agencies
of
the
united
states
are
not
to
be
considered
to
have
and
to
posses
the
powers,
privileges
and
immunities
of
the
united
states
unless
that
congress
clearly
grants
that
power
to
them.
and
your
honors
the
board
points
no
specific
statutory
authority
for
their
claim
that
they
maybe
considered
the
united
states
for
the
purposes
of
this
action.
indeed,
all
they
want
to
do
is
circumvent
another
specific
statutory
provision
which
is
2283.
yet
they
point
to
know
specific
statute
granting
them
that
power.
they
do
point
to
what
they
refer
to
as
implied
exceptions
under
form
of
section
265.
in
our
brief,
as
we
noted,
as
this
court
noted
in
the
richman
brothers’
case,
there
is
no
need
really
to
consider
those
implied
exceptions
because
it
is
clear
that
the
congress
did
not
intent
for
any
implied
exceptions
to
live
beyond
the
enactment
of
section
2283.
but
for
argument’s
sake,
it
should
be
noted
that
the
cases
that
the
board
relies
upon
are
not
really
cases
wherein
our
judicially
implied
exceptions
because
there
was,
in
fact,
conflicting
statutory
authority.
in
four
of
the
cases
the
board
relies
upon,
that
authority
was
granted
by
section
205
(c)
of
the
emergency
price
control
act.
the
most
noted
of
those
cases
was
bowles
v.
willingham.
in
fact,
it
is
notable
that
approximately
10
days
ago,
the
government
went
down
the
street
to
argue
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
and
told
judge
leventhal
that
the
bowles
v.
willingham
case
specifically
gave
the
president
the
power
to
do
what
he
is
doing
now
in
the
wage
and
price
control
freeze
because
it
was
an
emergency
statute
and
they
used
bowles
as
the
basis
for
their
case.
yet,
they
come
in
to
this
court
today
and
argue
that
the
bowles
case
is
just
a
clear
indication
of
the
fact
that
any
government
agency
can
be
given
a
power
of
the
united
states
under
rather
broad
argument
of
federal
preemption
and
make
no
mention
of
the
fact
that
that
was
an
emergency
price
control
act.
that
was
not
a
regulation
statute
as
we
would
note
in
the
general
sense
of
the
word.
however,
two
additional
cases
cited
by
the
board
in
its
brief
specifically
gave
jurisdiction
to
federal
district
courts
under
section
79
(k)
of
the
public
utilities
holding
act.
the
final
case
cited
by
the
board
as
a
presumed
exception
under
former
section
265
was
given
specific
authority,
gave
specific
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
under
the
agricultural
marketing
act
section
6.
so
the
board
comes
before
this
court
not
with
implied
judicial
exceptions
but
with
conflicting
statutory
authority
under
prior
section
265.
and
that
your
honors
as
was
noted
in
the
revisers'
note
of
section
2283,
was
why
the
congress
passed
section
2283.
they
had
to
get
their
house
in
order
and
note
specifically
when
jurisdiction
was
granted
to
a
federal
district
court
and
they
took
care
of
that
by
placing
the
first
exception
under
section
2283
the
words
“except
where
specifically
authorized
by
congress”
and
the
board
is
specifically
authorized
by
congress
under
section
10
(j)
and
10
(l),
to
seek
and
to
obtain
injunctive
relief.
but
those
sections
did
not
apply
to
this
case
as
the
board
acknowledges.
we
submit
your
honors
that
had
the
congress
intended
to
give
the
board
the
power
to
get
injunctive
relief
in
other
situations,
it
would
have
said
so.
every
place
where
it
has
given
the
board
power,
it
has
specified
that
power,
especially
your
honors
in
the
area
of
injunctive
relief
which
might
be
distinguished
from
rather
more
administrative
powers
which
the
board
notes
in
its
brief.
of
course
not
all
of
the
powers
to
implement
that
statute
were
given
to
the
board
and
the
statute
of
course
not
as
far
as
administrative
matters
to
be
concerned.
but
when
it
comes
to
an
injunctive
power,
those
powers
have
been
specific
in
their
implementation
by
the
congress
and
we
would
submit
that
since
10
(j)
and
10
(l)
do
not
apply
to
this
case,
the
board
has
no
statutory
power
to
attempt
to
get
the
injunction
that
it
seeks.
now
in
addition,
in
oral
argument,
the
board
notes
or
the
respondent
would
rely
upon
through
another
indication
of
why
the
board
should
not
be
before
this
court
claiming
to
be
the
united
states.
49
u.s.
code,
section
16
dealing
with
the
powers
of
the
icc
as
the
board
noted
specifically
says
that
to
implement
those
statutes
either
the
icc
may
do
so
any
aggrieved
party
or
the
united
states.
it
is
fairly
obvious
that
the
congress
need
not
have
said
the
icc
or
the
united
states
if
there
was
no
difference.
but
the
regulatory
agencies
of
the
government
are
not
parts
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
government.
it
is
specifically
noted
in
even
the
government
organization
manual
put
out
by
the
government
printing
office
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
branches
of
the
executive
government
and
regulatory
agencies.
in
fact,
there
are
51
regulatory
agencies,
including
the
labor
board
lifted
as
administrative
agencies.
your
honors,
this
distinction
was
drawn
by
this
court
sometime
ago
in
the
case
of
montgomery’s
executor
wherein
a
federal
trade
commission
case
involved
the
power
of
the
president
to
remove
a
member
of
that
commission.
now,
this
court
concluded
that
since
the
federal
trade
commission
was
not
an
executive
branch
of
the
government
that
therefore
the
president
did
not
have
that
power
and
in
so
doing
clearly
and
carefully
drew
the
distinction
between
executive
branches
of
the
government.
those
branches
that
do
not
have
the
power
to
sue
in
their
own
name
but
must
sue
as
the
united
states
and
are
indeed
to
be
considered
the
united
states
as
opposed
to
administrative
agencies,
for
example,
the
federal
trade
commission
and
as
was
noted
in
oral
argument
by
the
board,
faa
in
a
case
before
the
second
circuit
has
sued
under
the
name
of
the
united
states,
but
it
is
in
fact
an
executive
branch
of
the
government
and
that
is
a
significant
difference
that
is
not
found
in
this
case
because
the
labor
board
does
sue
in
its
own
name
but
it
is
not
the
united
states.
it
does
not
have
all
the
privileges,
powers,
immunities
of
the
united
states
and
that
it
therefore
may
not
come
under
this
court’s
decision
in
leiter
minerals
to
remove
itself
from
the
prohibition
of
section
2283.
an
additional
argument
that
the
board
makes
is
that
not
withstanding
any
argument
that
it
might
be
considered
the
united
states,
it
should
be
allowed
to
proceed
in
this
case
simply
because
it
was
established
by
the
congress.
it
has
preempted
the
area
of
labor
relation
and
that
therefore
it
should
be
able
to
proceed
against
any
state
court
that
gets
into
the
area
of
labor
relations
in
any
degree
i
would
imagine.
that
argument
was
advanced
also
in
the
richman
brothers’
case.
justice
frankfurter
in
that
case
noted
that
that
argument
must
be
rejected
simply
because
federal
statutes
may
have
preempted
an
area,
section
2283
must
be
strictly
construed.
and
that
unless
there
is
a
specific
act
of
congress,
unless
it
is
in
aid
of
that
court’s
jurisdiction
or
to
effectuate
the
judgments
of
that
court,
no
federal
district
court
may
overlook
the
limitations
of
section
2283.
mr.
william
a.
harding
no,
your
honor.
i
would
imagine
that
if
the
congress
would
request
the
attorney
general
to
proceed
for
it,
they
might
do
so
in
certain
circumstances,
i
would
imagine
all
branches
of
government
could.
mr.
william
a.
harding
well,
your
honor
that
is
an
internal
procedure
that
the
government
follows,
that
i
do
not
have
any
control
over.
i
know
that
there
are
several
people
at
the
labor
board
that
would
like
to
be
here
today
but
the
solicitor
is
not
available.
the
fact
is
your
honor
that
we
do
not
discount
the
fact
that
they
are
an
agency
to
the
federal
government
that
they
have
work
of
a
federal
nature
to
do.
what
we
do
say
though
is
that
that
work
of
a
federal
nature
to
do,
has
been
specifically
granted
to
them
in
at
least
as
regards
the
injunctive
power,
a
power
that
the
congress
does
not
wish
exercised
by
federal
district
courts
in
labor
matters
generally.
but
the
congress
has
been
careful
to
only
grant
limited
power
to
the
labor
board
to
proceed
for
injunctive
relief
and
that
that
power
has
not
been
given
to
the
board
to
circumvent
the
limitations
of
2283.
from
a
practical
standpoint,
the
argument
of
preemption
by
the
labor
board
really
attempts
to
get
the
cart
before
the
horse
because
what
it
tries
to
do
is
to
get
the
merits
of
the
case
in
before
jurisdiction
is
initially
granted.
and
this
of
course
was
why
the
district
court
denied
the
jurisdiction
of
claims
of
the
board.
in
fact,
as
we
noted
in
our
brief,
later
mr.
justice
cardozo
when
he
was
deciding
cases
for
the
state
of
new
york
noted
that
rights
exist
and
that
they
maybe
granted
after
jurisdiction
has
been
found,
but
that
rights
in
and
out
of
themselves
may
not
confer
jurisdiction.
this
is
what
the
board
would
seek
to
have
this
court
to
do.
there
are
additional
practical
reasons
to
conclude
that
the
labor
board
should
not
properly
be
before
this
court
seeking
to
circumvent
limitations
of
section
2283
to
go
beyond
the
system,
the
system
of
dual
courts
that
has
long
been
established
and
that
is
because
the
labor
board
does
not
even
exercise
the
power
that
it
is
granted
under
sections
10
(j)
and
10
(l)
as
noted
in
our
brief.
in
over
75%
of
what
it
acknowledges
to
be
meritorious
cases
it
does
not
seek
to
obtain
injunctive
relief.
it
is
rather
anomalous
then
that
the
board
comes
before
this
court
and
urges
this
court
to
imply
into
a
judicially
legislative
power
that
the
congress
has
not
granted
to
it.
for
all
of
these
reasons
then,
we
urge
this
court
to
again
strictly
construe
section
2283
to
conclude
that
the
board
may
not
on
a
basis
of
federal
preemption
alone
circumvent
the
limitations
of
section
2283
into
referring
the
lower
court.
mr.
william
a.
harding
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
has
been
another
example
of
the
continual
failure
of
the
labor
board
to
acknowledge
that
the
congress
meant
what
it
said
when
it
passed
the
anti-injunction
statute
and
noted
that
federal
district
court
do
not
have
the
power,
indeed
they
are
prohibited
from
enjoining
the
state
court
proceedings
unless
specifically
in
aide
of
their
own
jurisdiction
in
order
to
effectuate
their
own
judgments
or
where
specifically
provided
for
by
congress.
of
course,
this
prohibition
and
these
exceptions
are
found
in
28
u.s.
code
2283
and
that
is
the
heart
and
basis
of
this
case.
mr.
william
a.
harding
yes,
your
honor,
but
that
was
not
so
much
that
they
do
not
mean
what
they
say.
they
had
not
said
enough
--
mr.
william
a.
harding
yes,
your
honor
and
i
would
like
to
explore
for
this
court
that
united
states
exception
that
the
board
talks
about
as
well
as
a
few
other
reasons
why
we
believe
this
court
should
affirm
the
decisions
of
the
lower
courts
in
denying
to
the
board
the
relief
it
requests.
but
before
i
do
so,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
a
few
facts,
the
board
took
care
not
to
emphasize
and
one
of
it
was
incorrect.
first,
the
board
incorrectly
noted
in
oral
argument
that
the
employees
of
the
nash-finch
company
were
striking
in
the
summer
of
1969.
this
is
incorrect
and
the
board’s
complaint
does
not
say.
the
board’s
complaint,
part
6,
noted
on
page
5
of
the
appendix
specifically
notes
that
the
union
began
picketing
and
as
noted
in
affidavits
passed
as
an
appendix
to
our
brief
in
support
of
our
petition
in
the
state
court
clearly
point
out
the
pickets
were
not
employees.
therefore,
it
was
understandable
that
the
company
would
not
have
easy
access
to
the
names
or
identity
of
those
people
and
that
the
state
court
therefore
required
that
anyone
that
was
being
presumably
paid
by
the
union
to
come
and
picket
with
first
come
to
the
state
court,
and
identify
themselves
and
submit
to
its
jurisdiction.
so
these
were
not
employees.
these
were
presumably
paid
union
personnel
that
were
conducting
picketing.
secondly
and
perhaps
most
importantly,
the
picketing
in
the
instant
case
is
acknowledged
and
judicially
has
been
determined
as
mass
picketing.
on
the
one
hand
we
will
have
peaceful
picketing
and
on
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum,
we
have
non-peaceful
picketing.
in
between
a
type
of
picketing
that
maybe
either
or
both
is
a
type
of
picketing
that
most
state
courts
attach
statutes
regarding
and
which
they
refer
to
as
mass
picketing.
in
implementing
its
duty
under
a
state
police
power
to
protect
the
rights
of
its
citizens
and
to
make
the
conclusion
that
they
may
not
be
hampered
by
any
type
of
picketing
that
would
prohibit
ingress
and
egress
or
lead
to
violence,
most
states
prohibit,
as
does
the
nebraska
statute,
the
numbers
of
pickets
that
maybe
placed
and
specifically
states
that
they
may
not
prohibit
the
ingress
and
egress.
the
nebraska
statute
has
few
other
factors
in
it
which
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
affidavits
which
we
have
submitted
in
the
state
court
which
are
set
forth
in
appendix
2
in
our
brief,
indicates
that
there
was
substantial
blocking
of
ingress
and
egress
by
these
non-employee
pickets.
that
there
were
substantially
more
than
the
numbers
allowed
by
the
state
statute.
there
were
also
some
other
areas
of
some
threats
to
both
customers
of
the
stores
or
store
employees
which
suffice
to
say
your
honors,
if
the
board
comes
before
this
court
or
rather
piously
proclaiming,
this
is
peaceful
picketing
and
it
is
not.
there
is
a
judicial
determination
that
it
is
mass
picketing
and
there
is
a
little
bit
difference.
because
if
it
is
peaceful
picketing
only
the
company
acknowledges
that
there
is
obviously
at
least
an
arguable,
at
least
an
arguable
conclusion
that
the
picketing
is
therefore,
totally,
completely
governed
by
the
national
liberations
act
and
the
board.
however,
if
it
is
mass
picketing
there
is
a
very
substantial
state
interest
involved
under
the
state
police
powers
and
that
is
what
we
have
at
issue
in
this
case,
your
honors
that
state
police
power
versus
what
the
board
would
ask
this
court
do
which
is
to
imply
to
it
an
exception
on
the
basis
of
federal
preemption.
so
that
it
may
go
into
any
federal
district
court
anywhere
in
the
country
and
get
an
injunction
of
any
state
implementing
this
peaceful
--
it
is
police
powers
as
regards
mass
picketing.
now,
we
also
note
in
our
brief
your
honors
that,
it
is
truly
we
have
never
had
any
holding
on
the
merits.
there
has
never
been
any
findings
of
fact
by
the
federal
district
court.
unfortunately,
we
were
not
really
in
a
position
to
be
vitally
concerned
about
this
since
we
already
had
our
judicial
determination
that
it
was
mass
picketing,
now
that
is
security
issue.
the
board
was
the
moving
party
in
the
federal
district
court
made
no
effort
to
place
any
of
those
facts
before
the
court
and
as
noted
in
oral
argument
the
case
was
determined
on
our
motion
to
dismiss
and
then
it
was
affirmed
by
the
eighth
circuit.
but
there
are
police
courts
or
police
department,
fire
department
records,
records
of
the
state
department
of
agriculture
which
we
note
in
our
brief
that
we
believe
this
court
could
take
judicial
notice
of
which
indicate
that
there
were
substantially
other
activities
that
could
properly
be
used
to
classify
this
picketing
as
violent.
there
were
--
mr.
william
a.
harding
no,
your
honors.
we
know
that
if
the
district
court
was
correct,
it
did
not
have
jurisdiction,
it
does
not
make
validity
--
mr.
william
a.
harding
no,
your
honor.
but
the
board
seems
to
make
that
view
because
the
board
says
that
they
should
have
an
exception
implied
for
them,
notwithstanding
the
united
states
exception.
our
argument
goes
on
to
say
we
feel
that
this
court
on
the
basis
of
federal
preemption
alone,
an
argument
which
was
rejected
by
this
court
both
in
the
richman
brothers’
case
and
last
year
at
atlantic
coast
line
on
the
basis
of
preemption
alone
it
should
allow
the
board
or
any
other
federal
agency
to
enter
the
district
court.
we
do
not
agree
with
that.
we
do
not
believe
this
court
does.
mr.
william
a.
harding
yes
your
honor,
if
it
was
peaceful
picketing
we
would
not
have
gone
into
state
court.
mr.
william
a.
harding
only
to
the
extent,
your
honor
that
the
board
has
made
this
as
a
basis
of
its
argument
before
this
court
as
to
why
it
should
have
had
jurisdiction
given
to
the
district
court
and
in
our
counter
argument
to
that
fact.
we
are
only
noting
that
if
this
court
should
consider
this
preemption
argument
of
the
board
that
it
should
also
consider
few
other
things
than
just
peaceful
picketing.
but
we
believe
the
issue
could
be
disposed
off
by
the
judicial
determination
in
the
state
court
that
this
was
mass
picketing,
not
peaceful
picketing.
mr.
william
a.
harding
perhaps,
your
honor
but
if
there
is
--
mr.
william
a.
harding
if
there
is
only
peaceful
picketing,
i
doubt
we
would
be
here.
mr.
william
a.
harding
i
realize
that
that
is
why
i
say
perhaps.
mr.
william
a.
harding
if
there
is
only
that
issue
involved
your
honor?
mr.
william
a.
harding
if
there
is
only
that
issue
involved
i
think
the
federal
district
court
might
have
felt
itself
quite
bothered
by
that
issue
but
i
think
--
i
think
the
--
mr.
william
a.
harding
my
position
is
your
honor
should
have
been
litigated
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
william
a.
harding
yes
sir.
mr.
william
a.
harding
i
do
not
believe
that
that
is
really
properly
before
this
court
or
i
have
--
in
further
answer
to
your
question
i
--
mr.
william
a.
harding
well,
the
reason
i
say
i
do
not
believe
it
is
properly
before
this
court
is
because
the
board
can
adequately
get
around
the
limitations
of
2283
and
it
could
have
and
should
have
proceeded
in
the
state
court
and
could
have
(inaudible)
its
problems
there.
there
are
number
of
reasons
why
we
believe
that
this
court
should
conclude
if
the
lower
court
was
correct
in
what
it
did,
i
would
like
to
first
draw
the
court’s
attention
to
the
statutory
framework
in
which
section
2283
appeared
to
the
district
court
as
is
denoted
by
this
court
in
previous
questions,
the
norris-laguardia
act
indicate
that
federal
district
courts
are
not
encouraged
to
grant
injunctive
relief
in
labor
matters.
29
u.s.
code,
sections
101
and
104
indicate
that
they
should
not.
in
fact
sections
107
and
109
indicate
that
they
should
make
detailed
findings
of
fact
before
they
would
ever
enter
such
scenario
granting
injunctive
relief.
but,
notwithstanding
that
fact,
29
u.s.
code,
section
160
usually
referred
to
as
sections
10
(j)
and
10
(l)
of
the
act
gives
to
the
labor
board
the
power
to
go
ahead
in
certain
situations
in
the
federal
district
court
and
obtain
injunctive
relief
if
they
feel
it
is
an
extraordinary
circumstance
where
they
should
exercise
that
power
and
go
in
and
get
that
injunction.
in
addition
to
that
of
course,
we
have
28
u.s.
code
2283
which
has
been
law
in
some
form
since
1793
and
i
submit
to
the
court,
your
honors
that
the
distinction
is
somewhat
more
basic
than
that
even
as
has
been
noted
in
the
amicus
brief
by
the
national
chamber
of
commerce
and
in
our
brief
that
this
has
been
a
long
standing
implementation
of
the
notion
in
congress
that
there
should
and
must
be
a
dual
court
system
in
this
country.
i
direct
your
honors’
attention
to
the
federalist
paper
number
46
which
we
note
in
our
brief
where
mr.
madison,
wherein
he
indicates
that
there
is
an
even
deeper
division
in
that
because
when
the
people
of
this
country
who
are
the
sovereign
gave
to
the
new
federal
government
its
power
to
do
what
they
allowed
it
to
do,
that
there
was
considerable
concern
over
what
that
federal
government
might
do
to
the
state
governments.
mr.
madison
notes
quite
clearly
at
number
46
that
if
there
is
an
area
where
a
state
court
infringes
on
an
area
that
the
federal
government
thinks
is
unfriendly
to
it,
did
notwithstanding
that
fact,
the
states
must
clearly
have
the
advantage.
and
reason
in
that
is
because
the
states
were
giving
the
power
to
the
federal
government
and
that
they
must
maintain
that
advantage.
and
so,
we
would
say
that
section
2283
came
before
the
district
court
with
a
very,
very
basic
distinction
between
the
federal
and
the
state
court
judicial
systems.
based
upon
that,
the
state
action
in
giving
the
company
relief
and
redress
under
the
state
mass
picketing
statute
is
certainly
not
before
this
court
on
the
grounds
that
that
is
not
within
their
power.
for
as
noted
in
numerous
decisions
before
this
court
as
set
out
in
our
brief
on
page
13,
this
court
has
many
times
noted
that
regulation
of
mass
picketing
by
state
courts
and
by
state
statute
is
clearly
and
completely
within
the
province
of
the
state
police
powers.
it
was
upon
this
statutory
framework
then
that
this
matter
reached
the
federal
district
court.
at
that
point
the
board
raised
its
two
arguments
that
it,
number
one
should
be
considered
the
united
states
for
the
purposes
of
this
action
and
get
around
section
2283
and
at
number
2
it
could
be
considered
to
get
around
section
2283
simply
because
it
had
been
established
by
the
congress.
i
suppose
they
base
it
on
a
very
large
federal
preemption
argument
on
this
issue.
mr.
william
a.
harding
well,
your
honor
a
number
of
cases,
wisconsin
--
the
wisconsin
cases,
the
allen
bradley
case
has
talked
about
that.
mr.
william
a.
harding
i
am
not
aware
that
it
did
your
honor.
this
court
noted
in
the
city
of
el
paso
case
in
1965
about
the
broad
powers
of
the
state
police
powers
that
the
state
should
be
granted
wide
discretion
in
determining
how
to
exercise
those
state
police
powers
and
mr.
justice
reed
in
ritter’s
café
in
1942
noted
specifically
that
there
was
no
serious
question
that
states
had
the
power
to
place
a
good
deal
of
regulation
on
mass
picketing
to
regulate
the
numbers
and
to
regulate
the
blocking
of
ingress,
egress,
etcetera.
the
basic
argument
that
the
labor
board
brings
before
this
court
that
it
should
be
considered
the
united
states
seems
to
have
been
decided
by
this
court’s
decision
in
the
nathanson
case
344
u.s.,
wherein
it
was
noted
that
a
debt
and
in
that
situation
a
back
pay
proceeding
that
was
owed
to
the
labor
board
was
not
entitled
to
preferences
of
debt
owed
to
the
united
states
would
be.
nevertheless,
this
case
is
still
before
the
court
because
the
board
maintains
that
it
should
be
considered
the
united
states
because
there
is
no
reason
to
consider
that
it
would
not
be.
but
your
honors
of
course,
it
is
recognized
that
the
federal
government
is
a
government
of
limited
of
powers.
it
is
also
a
government
of
specific
powers.
the
labor
board
was
established
not
to
be
the
united
states
for
all
intents
and
purposes
but
it
was
established
to
be
a
specific
agency
of
the
government
to
enforce
a
specific
statute
under
specific
policy
directives
of
the
congress.
i
do
not
believe
that
congress
intended
to
make
the
labor
board
into
what
might
be
referred
to
as
a
frankenstein’s
monster
and
that
it
could
go
across
the
entire
country
doing
what
it
would
like
and
considering
that
it
had
the
powers,
immunities
and
privileges
of
the
united
states.
indeed,
this
court
has
noted
previously
in
cases
very
similar
that
agencies
of
the
united
states
government
as
noted
in
the
menihan
case
which
we
note
in
our
brief
on
page
20,
page
23,
that
this
court
has
previously
concluded
that
agencies
of
the
united
states
are
not
to
be
considered
to
have
and
to
posses
the
powers,
privileges
and
immunities
of
the
united
states
unless
that
congress
clearly
grants
that
power
to
them.
and
your
honors
the
board
points
no
specific
statutory
authority
for
their
claim
that
they
maybe
considered
the
united
states
for
the
purposes
of
this
action.
indeed,
all
they
want
to
do
is
circumvent
another
specific
statutory
provision
which
is
2283.
yet
they
point
to
know
specific
statute
granting
them
that
power.
they
do
point
to
what
they
refer
to
as
implied
exceptions
under
form
of
section
265.
in
our
brief,
as
we
noted,
as
this
court
noted
in
the
richman
brothers’
case,
there
is
no
need
really
to
consider
those
implied
exceptions
because
it
is
clear
that
the
congress
did
not
intent
for
any
implied
exceptions
to
live
beyond
the
enactment
of
section
2283.
but
for
argument’s
sake,
it
should
be
noted
that
the
cases
that
the
board
relies
upon
are
not
really
cases
wherein
our
judicially
implied
exceptions
because
there
was,
in
fact,
conflicting
statutory
authority.
in
four
of
the
cases
the
board
relies
upon,
that
authority
was
granted
by
section
205
(c)
of
the
emergency
price
control
act.
the
most
noted
of
those
cases
was
bowles
v.
willingham.
in
fact,
it
is
notable
that
approximately
10
days
ago,
the
government
went
down
the
street
to
argue
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
and
told
judge
leventhal
that
the
bowles
v.
willingham
case
specifically
gave
the
president
the
power
to
do
what
he
is
doing
now
in
the
wage
and
price
control
freeze
because
it
was
an
emergency
statute
and
they
used
bowles
as
the
basis
for
their
case.
yet,
they
come
in
to
this
court
today
and
argue
that
the
bowles
case
is
just
a
clear
indication
of
the
fact
that
any
government
agency
can
be
given
a
power
of
the
united
states
under
rather
broad
argument
of
federal
preemption
and
make
no
mention
of
the
fact
that
that
was
an
emergency
price
control
act.
that
was
not
a
regulation
statute
as
we
would
note
in
the
general
sense
of
the
word.
however,
two
additional
cases
cited
by
the
board
in
its
brief
specifically
gave
jurisdiction
to
federal
district
courts
under
section
79
(k)
of
the
public
utilities
holding
act.
the
final
case
cited
by
the
board
as
a
presumed
exception
under
former
section
265
was
given
specific
authority,
gave
specific
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
under
the
agricultural
marketing
act
section
6.
so
the
board
comes
before
this
court
not
with
implied
judicial
exceptions
but
with
conflicting
statutory
authority
under
prior
section
265.
and
that
your
honors
as
was
noted
in
the
revisers'
note
of
section
2283,
was
why
the
congress
passed
section
2283.
they
had
to
get
their
house
in
order
and
note
specifically
when
jurisdiction
was
granted
to
a
federal
district
court
and
they
took
care
of
that
by
placing
the
first
exception
under
section
2283
the
words
“except
where
specifically
authorized
by
congress”
and
the
board
is
specifically
authorized
by
congress
under
section
10
(j)
and
10
(l),
to
seek
and
to
obtain
injunctive
relief.
but
those
sections
did
not
apply
to
this
case
as
the
board
acknowledges.
we
submit
your
honors
that
had
the
congress
intended
to
give
the
board
the
power
to
get
injunctive
relief
in
other
situations,
it
would
have
said
so.
every
place
where
it
has
given
the
board
power,
it
has
specified
that
power,
especially
your
honors
in
the
area
of
injunctive
relief
which
might
be
distinguished
from
rather
more
administrative
powers
which
the
board
notes
in
its
brief.
of
course
not
all
of
the
powers
to
implement
that
statute
were
given
to
the
board
and
the
statute
of
course
not
as
far
as
administrative
matters
to
be
concerned.
but
when
it
comes
to
an
injunctive
power,
those
powers
have
been
specific
in
their
implementation
by
the
congress
and
we
would
submit
that
since
10
(j)
and
10
(l)
do
not
apply
to
this
case,
the
board
has
no
statutory
power
to
attempt
to
get
the
injunction
that
it
seeks.
now
in
addition,
in
oral
argument,
the
board
notes
or
the
respondent
would
rely
upon
through
another
indication
of
why
the
board
should
not
be
before
this
court
claiming
to
be
the
united
states.
49
u.s.
code,
section
16
dealing
with
the
powers
of
the
icc
as
the
board
noted
specifically
says
that
to
implement
those
statutes
either
the
icc
may
do
so
any
aggrieved
party
or
the
united
states.
it
is
fairly
obvious
that
the
congress
need
not
have
said
the
icc
or
the
united
states
if
there
was
no
difference.
but
the
regulatory
agencies
of
the
government
are
not
parts
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
government.
it
is
specifically
noted
in
even
the
government
organization
manual
put
out
by
the
government
printing
office
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
branches
of
the
executive
government
and
regulatory
agencies.
in
fact,
there
are
51
regulatory
agencies,
including
the
labor
board
lifted
as
administrative
agencies.
your
honors,
this
distinction
was
drawn
by
this
court
sometime
ago
in
the
case
of
montgomery’s
executor
wherein
a
federal
trade
commission
case
involved
the
power
of
the
president
to
remove
a
member
of
that
commission.
now,
this
court
concluded
that
since
the
federal
trade
commission
was
not
an
executive
branch
of
the
government
that
therefore
the
president
did
not
have
that
power
and
in
so
doing
clearly
and
carefully
drew
the
distinction
between
executive
branches
of
the
government.
those
branches
that
do
not
have
the
power
to
sue
in
their
own
name
but
must
sue
as
the
united
states
and
are
indeed
to
be
considered
the
united
states
as
opposed
to
administrative
agencies,
for
example,
the
federal
trade
commission
and
as
was
noted
in
oral
argument
by
the
board,
faa
in
a
case
before
the
second
circuit
has
sued
under
the
name
of
the
united
states,
but
it
is
in
fact
an
executive
branch
of
the
government
and
that
is
a
significant
difference
that
is
not
found
in
this
case
because
the
labor
board
does
sue
in
its
own
name
but
it
is
not
the
united
states.
it
does
not
have
all
the
privileges,
powers,
immunities
of
the
united
states
and
that
it
therefore
may
not
come
under
this
court’s
decision
in
leiter
minerals
to
remove
itself
from
the
prohibition
of
section
2283.
an
additional
argument
that
the
board
makes
is
that
not
withstanding
any
argument
that
it
might
be
considered
the
united
states,
it
should
be
allowed
to
proceed
in
this
case
simply
because
it
was
established
by
the
congress.
it
has
preempted
the
area
of
labor
relation
and
that
therefore
it
should
be
able
to
proceed
against
any
state
court
that
gets
into
the
area
of
labor
relations
in
any
degree
i
would
imagine.
that
argument
was
advanced
also
in
the
richman
brothers’
case.
justice
frankfurter
in
that
case
noted
that
that
argument
must
be
rejected
simply
because
federal
statutes
may
have
preempted
an
area,
section
2283
must
be
strictly
construed.
and
that
unless
there
is
a
specific
act
of
congress,
unless
it
is
in
aid
of
that
court’s
jurisdiction
or
to
effectuate
the
judgments
of
that
court,
no
federal
district
court
may
overlook
the
limitations
of
section
2283.
mr.
william
a.
harding
no,
your
honor.
i
would
imagine
that
if
the
congress
would
request
the
attorney
general
to
proceed
for
it,
they
might
do
so
in
certain
circumstances,
i
would
imagine
all
branches
of
government
could.
mr.
william
a.
harding
well,
your
honor
that
is
an
internal
procedure
that
the
government
follows,
that
i
do
not
have
any
control
over.
i
know
that
there
are
several
people
at
the
labor
board
that
would
like
to
be
here
today
but
the
solicitor
is
not
available.
the
fact
is
your
honor
that
we
do
not
discount
the
fact
that
they
are
an
agency
to
the
federal
government
that
they
have
work
of
a
federal
nature
to
do.
what
we
do
say
though
is
that
that
work
of
a
federal
nature
to
do,
has
been
specifically
granted
to
them
in
at
least
as
regards
the
injunctive
power,
a
power
that
the
congress
does
not
wish
exercised
by
federal
district
courts
in
labor
matters
generally.
but
the
congress
has
been
careful
to
only
grant
limited
power
to
the
labor
board
to
proceed
for
injunctive
relief
and
that
that
power
has
not
been
given
to
the
board
to
circumvent
the
limitations
of
2283.
from
a
practical
standpoint,
the
argument
of
preemption
by
the
labor
board
really
attempts
to
get
the
cart
before
the
horse
because
what
it
tries
to
do
is
to
get
the
merits
of
the
case
in
before
jurisdiction
is
initially
granted.
and
this
of
course
was
why
the
district
court
denied
the
jurisdiction
of
claims
of
the
board.
in
fact,
as
we
noted
in
our
brief,
later
mr.
justice
cardozo
when
he
was
deciding
cases
for
the
state
of
new
york
noted
that
rights
exist
and
that
they
maybe
granted
after
jurisdiction
has
been
found,
but
that
rights
in
and
out
of
themselves
may
not
confer
jurisdiction.
this
is
what
the
board
would
seek
to
have
this
court
to
do.
there
are
additional
practical
reasons
to
conclude
that
the
labor
board
should
not
properly
be
before
this
court
seeking
to
circumvent
limitations
of
section
2283
to
go
beyond
the
system,
the
system
of
dual
courts
that
has
long
been
established
and
that
is
because
the
labor
board
does
not
even
exercise
the
power
that
it
is
granted
under
sections
10
(j)
and
10
(l)
as
noted
in
our
brief.
in
over
75%
of
what
it
acknowledges
to
be
meritorious
cases
it
does
not
seek
to
obtain
injunctive
relief.
it
is
rather
anomalous
then
that
the
board
comes
before
this
court
and
urges
this
court
to
imply
into
a
judicially
legislative
power
that
the
congress
has
not
granted
to
it.
for
all
of
these
reasons
then,
we
urge
this
court
to
again
strictly
construe
section
2283
to
conclude
that
the
board
may
not
on
a
basis
of
federal
preemption
alone
circumvent
the
limitations
of
section
2283
into
referring
the
lower
court.
