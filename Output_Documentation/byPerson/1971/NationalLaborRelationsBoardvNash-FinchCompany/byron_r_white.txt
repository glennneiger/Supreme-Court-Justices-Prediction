justice

mr.
wallace,
would
the
hearing
in
the
district
court
which
you
suggest
merely
go
to
whether
or
not
the
activities
that
have
been
enjoined
are
arguably
protected
or
would
you
say
the
district
court
could
decide
then
and
there,
whether
they
are
actually
were
protected
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice

for
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
they
--
if
your
position
is
this
that
it
were
arguably
protected
the
district
court
should
enjoin
the
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
there
is
no
way
of
getting
the
issue
before
the
court
is
to
whether
it
is
actually
protected?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
younger
and
(inaudible)
sort
of
an
approach
or
atlantic
coast
line?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
this
were
private
parties
trying
to
get
the
federal
court
injunction,
the
younger
case
might
well?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
richman
case
just
to
be
heard
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
wallace
could
i
just
ask
you
in
dealing
with
the
norris-laguardia
act
and
the
national
labor
relations
board,
does
the
board's
right
to
get
an
injunction
despite
the
norris-laguardia
act
rested
on
specific
statutory
exemption?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
notice
at
page
41
of
your
brief,
a
statutory
provision
upon
the
filing
of
any
such
petition
etcetera,
the
district
court
shall
have
jurisdiction
and
grant
injunctive
relief,
notwithstanding
any
other
provisional
of
law.
that
is
not
express?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
important,
are
they
not
comparable
provisions,
i
do
not
remember,
but
i
thought
wherever
the
board
has
been
given
authority
to
seek
injunctive
relief
is
usually
been
added
something
like
this,
“notwithstanding
any
other
provision
of
law.”
now,
if
your
position
is
correct
it
would
have
not
been
necessary
at
all
to
provide
for
that
exemption
from
norris-laguardia
because
norris-laguardia
does
not
party
the
united
states
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
might
have
a
lot
of
to
do
with
whether
congress
intended
as
the
board
to
exercise
the
authority
of
the
united
states.
it
is
outside
these
specific
areas
where
the
board
can
get
injunction,
if
outside
that
area
norris-laguardia
would
bar
the
injunction
of
the
board,
then
the
board
is
not
the
united
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
about
the
labor
disputes?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
but
would
you
not
be
making
the
same
2283
argument
here
even
if
there
was
nothing
involved
in
the
state
court
except
peaceful
picketing?
that
the
federal
court
would
have
no
power,
under
2283
to
enjoin
the
state
court
proceedings?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
perhaps?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
not
the
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
so
happens
that
the
court,
that
the
state
court
said
that
even
if
you
limit
picketing
to
two
people,
you
cannot
hand
out
any
hand
bill.
now,
there
is
a
--
just
this
clear
--
an
issue
in
this
case
that
would
you
say
that
federal
court
could
have
--
in
this
case
could
have
enjoined
the
state
court
from
enforcing
that
particular
provision
and
its
injunction
despite
2283?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
(voice
overlap)
federal
district
court.
i
want
to
know
what
your
position
is
on
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
2283
would
bar
the
federal
court
in
any
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
i
think
that
would
be
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
not
or
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
before
the
court
as
to
whether
the
--
any,
the
issue
is
whether
any
part
of
the
--
the
federal
court
had
power
to
enjoin
any
part
of
the
state
court
injunctions?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
might
be,
it
might
be
that
there
is
a
specific
reference
in
norris-laguardia
act
in
the
1935
act,
specifically
named.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
the
united
states
is
not
covered
by
the
norris-laguardia
act,
and
the
agency
is
entitled
the
exemption
of
the
united
states,
that
would
not
been
in
the
need
for
this
sort
of
provision.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
has
been
since
so
held.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
is
the
kind
of
injunction
that
is
not
specifically
authorized
again,
under
the
terms
and
privilege
of
the
act.
it
has
to
be
implied
this
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
wallace,
would
the

in
the
district
court
which
you
suggest
merely
go
to
whether
or

that

would

whether

are
actually

or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice

for
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
they
--
if
your
position
is
this
that
it
were
arguably
protected
the
district
court
should
enjoin
the
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
there
is
no
way
of
getting
the
issue
before
the
court
is
to
whether
it
is
actually
protected?
justice
byron

what
about
younger
and
(inaudible)
sort
of
an

justice

so
if

i
want
to

what
your

so
2283
would
bar
the
