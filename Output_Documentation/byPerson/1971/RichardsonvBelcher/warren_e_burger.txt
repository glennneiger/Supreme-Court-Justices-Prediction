we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
number
53,
richardson
against
belcher.
before
you
proceed
mr.
stone,
it
appears
to
me
that
we
could
announce
for
council
in
number
5040,
the
mayer
against
chicago.
it
is
very
unlikely
that
the
case
will
be
reached
today
and
if
you
wish
to
be
excused
until
tomorrow
morning
at
10:00,
you
maybe.
mr.
stone,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.

mr.
stone,
if
this
decision
withstand
as
it
is
now.
is
it
conceivable
that
the
one
responsive
of
the
states
might
be
to
just
adopt
this
type
of
a
statute
in
the
workman’s
compensation
programs
and
require
the
deduction
of
any
amount
to
receive
some
social
security?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
certainly
illogical
thing,
if
this
sort
of
thing
was
very
widespread
to
the
states
under
the
financial
pressure,
they
would
rather
have
deduction
the
other
way.

chief

mr.
harris.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
harris,
since
the
employee
from
what
you
have
just
said,
apparently
makes
no
contribution,
pays
nothing
does
that
distinguish
it
from
private
insurance
for
which
the
employee
would
have
to
do
with
paying
out
his
own
funds?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
has
not
this
court
says,
it
does
not
have
to
be
a
perfect
classification
if
it
is
a
rational
consultation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
i
understand
you
virtually
to
conceive
that
if
deduction
were
made
for
every
type
of
benefit
privately
secured
as
well
as
this,
you
would
not
have
no
complain?
chief
justice

the
private
client
they
do
not
pay
for
this.
chief

am
speaking
of
the
workman’s
compensation
if
he
does
not
pay
for
the
--
the
employee
if
he
does
not
pay
for
that
insurance
coverage.
chief
