mr.
richard
b.
stone
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
which
is
on
direct
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
from
the
southern
district
of
west
virginia
is
in
a
somewhat
unusual
posture
and
that
a
single
judge
district
court
has
declared
unconstitutional
section
224,
the
social
security
act.
in
the
more
normal
instance
of
course,
an
adjudication
that
a
federal
statute
is
unconstitutional,
would
originate
and
direct
appeal
would
be
taken
from
a
pre-judge
court.
this
court
has
held;
however
in
a
closely
similar
context
in
flemming
v.
nestor
reported
at
363
u.s.
and
in
other
cases
as
well.
that
a
pre-judge
court
is
not
mandatory
under
28
u.s.c
2282,
when
an
action
based
on
the
alleged
unconstitutionality
of
the
federal
statute,
does
not
seek
to
enjoin
the
operation
of
statutory
scheme,
but
merely
to
acquire
the
payment
of
some
benefit
afforded
by
that
scheme
and
the
court
has
invariably
retained
direct
appeals
in
these
circumstances
and
no
question
has
been
raised
by
other
side
as
to
jurisdiction,
and
i
take
it
that
there
is
none.
in
this
case,
the
provision
in
question,
section
224
of
the
social
security
act,
provides
that
social
security
disability
benefits,
which
caused
by
roughly
to
lost
earnings
resulting
from
the
claimant’s
disability
must
be
reduced
according
to
a
fairly
complex
formula
by
virtue
of
the
recipient’s
simultaneous
receipt
of
periodic
workman’s
compensation
benefits
under
a
state
of
federal
workman’s
compensation
plan,
in
the
ordinary
case,
of
course,
it
is
the
state
plan.
the
offset
provision
only
applies
for
purposes
relevant
here.
if
the
total
of
the
claimant’s
social
security
disability
benefits
and
his
workman’s
compensation
benefits
exceed
80%
of
his
average
monthly
earnings
and
that
is
gross
earnings
without
taking
into
account
tax
computations
acquired
to
injury.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
excuse
me.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yeah,
the
average
monthly
earning
is
computed
on
a
five
year
period.
and,
benefits
are
only
reduced
in
so
far
as
they
exceed
80%
of
those
earnings,
and
of
course,
the
actual
effect
for
anyone
whose
tax
status
put
him
--
causes
him
pay
income
tax,
in
excess
of
20%
of
his
gross
salary,
actually
comes
out
even
with
the
80%,
comes
out
with
more
and
take
home
pay
that
he
had
acquired
through
his
injury.
the
appellee
in
this
case
mr.
belcher
became
disabled
in
1968
and
was
awarded
at
$330
a
month
in
social
security
and
disability
benefits
without
regard
to
any
workman’s
compensation,
and
the
secretary
had
no
notice
of
his
receipt
of
workman’s
compensation
at
that
time
and
that
award
was
made
in
october
of
1968.
three
months
later,
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare,
notified
mr.
belcher
that
his
federal
benefits
would
be
reduced
by
a
$104
a
month
because
of
his
simultaneous
receipt
of
$203
per
month
in
state
workman’s
compensation
benefits.
the
scheme
is
quite
simple,
without
the
offset,
mr.
belcher
would
have
received
a
total
of
$534
in
social
security
and
workman’s
compensation
benefits
which
would
have
been
a
100%
of
his
prior
gross
earnings,
and
as
a
result
of
the
offset,
his
benefits
total
to
$430
or
exactly
80%
of
his
average
prior
earnings.
mr.
belcher
requested
a
hearing
to
challenge
the
reduction
of
his
federal
benefits
and
the
hearing
was
held
before
a
hearing
examiner
at
which
appellee
was
represented
by
an
attorney,
who
i
believe
represents
him
here
in
this
court
today.
the
hearing
examiner
upheld
the
reduction
and
this
ruling
became
in
the
normal
course
of
hew
administrator
rulings,
the
final
decision
of
the
secretary
of
hew.
i
believe
he
then
brought
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
under
section
405
or
42
u.s.c.
405g
to
reveal
(somebody
coughed)
the
secretary’s
administrative
decision.
and
i
take
it
that
at
no
point
in
the
court
below
or
in
the
administrative
process
has
appellee
denied
in
any
aspect
of
the
factual
or
legal
basis
which
underlay
the
secretary’s
determination
that
section
224
applied
to
him
and
precisely
the
manner
in
which
hew
applied
it.
nor
has
appellee
raised
any
question
whatsoever
as
to
the
procedural
rights,
such
as
an
evidentiary
hearing
which
has
been
fully
afforded
to
him.
his
sole
contention
and
the
sole
ground
of
decision
in
the
district
court
below
was
that
it
is
unconstitutional,
as
a
substantive
matter
for
congress
to
reduce
social
security
disability
benefits
by
virtue
of
workman’s
compensation
benefits.
in
upholding
appellee’s
claim,
the
court
below
stands
alone
and
it
odds
with
eight
other
district
courts,
at
least
eight
other
district
courts
that
have
routinely
ruled
on
this
question
and
with
their
recent
decision
of
the
6th
circuit
court
of
appeals,
which
has
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
section
224.
now,
the
court
arrived
at
its
decision
that
section
224
is
unconstitutional
on
essentially
two
grounds.
the
first
of
these
grounds,
i
believe,
can
be
dealt
with
rather
briefly
and
i
think
it
reflects
a
misconception
of
certain
decisions
of
this
court
which
are
to
be
pretty
readily
apparent
here.
in
goldberg
versus
kelly,
at
397
u.s.,
this
court
held
it
when
the
administrators
of
a
state
welfare
program,
in
that
case
it
was
the
aid
to
dependent
children
program,
determined
that
a
particular
recipient
no
longer
qualifies
for
benefits
under
the
statutory
standards
governing
that
program,
those
benefits
that
cannot
be
cut
off
until
the
recipient
has
been
given
some
sort
of
an
evidentiary
hearing.
this
court
reasoned
in
goldberg
that
a
welfare
recipient
in
the
adc
program
has
at
least,
a
sufficient
right
whether
you
call
it
a
property
right
or
whatever
you
call
it,
in
those
benefits,
so
that
it
violates
standard
notions
or
procedural
due
process
to
cut
off
those
benefits
summarily
without
any
kind
of
a
proceeding.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no,
no
claim
whatsoever,
mr.
justice
brennan.
it
maybe
said,
i
suppose
that
goldberg,
what
goldberg
did
was
put
to
a
final
rest.
a
theory
that
really
the
government
had
not
attempted
to
make
in
a
welfare
context
for
sometime,
that
those
benefits
are
really
a
privilege
rather
that
a
right
and
if
that
automatically
cuts
off
any
procedural
difficulty
in
simply
taking
them
away.
and
i
think,
that
that
document
has
been
laid
to
rest
and
those
extractions
happily
are
not
issue
here.
however,
this
district
court
through
a
process
that
is
not
entirely
elaborated
and
which
is
somewhat
mystical
to
me,
reasons
on
the
basis
of
goldberg
and
kelly
that
congress
cannot
build
into
the
statutory
formula
for
computing
social
security
disability
benefits,
which
it
analogizes
to
welfare
benefits.
any
circumstances
which
would
reduce
the
maximum
allowable
benefit.
now,
without
going
into
the
applicability
of
goldberg
and
kelly
to
social
security
programs,
a
question
which
we
assume
be
before
this
court
in
which
certiorari
was
granted
yesterday,
i
gather.
i
think,
it
is
safe
to
say
that
goldberg
and
kelly
which
dealt
entirely
with
procedural
rights
are
not
in
question
here,
but
in
no
way
implies
a
limitation
on
the
legislative
authority
to
device
a
reasonable
substantive
formula
for
determining
the
proper
amount
of
social
security
benefits
owed
to
any
claimant.
in
other
words,
from
goldberg
and
kelly
which
is
applied
to
this
case,
i
suppose,
might
preclude
hew
from
cutting
off
the
claimant’s
benefits
without
a
hearing.
it
is
very,
very
long
steps
to
the
notion
that
that
claimant
has
a
vested
interest
in
the
maximum
amount
of
benefit
which
statute
ever
even
potentially
afforded
to
him
or
the
notion
that
congress
can
attach
no
other
qualifications
to
the
statutory
standard
which
governs
the
amount
of
benefits
owing
to
the
claimant.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that
is
right.
that
is
right
mr.
justice
marshall.
this
is
the
statutory
standard
and
it
is
the
statutory
standard
which
mr.
belcher
brings
to
question
here
and
i
wish
the
district
judge
ruled.
as
a
matter
of
fact
here
it
shows
in
the
record
that
this
hearing
process
was,
i
suppose,
essentially
a
little
useless
since
the
ground
that
was
being
claimed
was
the
unconstitutionally
of
the
statute
and
the
hearing
examiner
noted
several
times
that
you
do
not
seem
to
bring
in
the
question
anything
about
your
applicability
to
the
statute.
now,
it
is
interesting
to
know,
just
put
this
in
perspective,
that
when
disability
benefits
were
first
introduced
into
the
social
security
program
in
1956,
recipients
were
required
to
offset
the
full
amount
of
workman’s
compensation
benefits
regardless
of
whether
the
total
of
disability
and
workman’s
compensation
exceeded
any
specified
limit.
that
provision
was
temporarily
repealed
in
1958
and
then
reenacted
in
1965
with
the
current
proviso
that
the
benefits
will
not
be
reduced
unless
the
total
of
the
two
types
of
programs
equals
80%
of
prior
earnings,
and
i
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
their
legislative
history
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes,
we
talked
--
.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
it
was
repealed
in
1958,
essentially
because
there
was
a
testimony
in
legislative
hearings
to
the
effect
that
there
really
were
not
that
many
instances
of
duplication.
i
have
pointed
out
that
the
workman’s
compensation
program
is
very
much
expanded
since
then.
it
was
thought
that
the
offset
was
somewhat
experimental
when
it
was
passed
in
1956.
in
1958,
congress
was
persuaded
in
some
way
that
there
simply
were
not
enough
instances
of
duplication
to
(inaudible)
to
go
through
the
administrative
difficulty
of
enforcing
these
offset
provisions.
now,
between
1958
and
1965,
there
were
volumes,
and
volumes
of
testimony
to
which
we
refer
in
our
brief
to
the
effect
that
in
fact
there
was
a
serious
amount
of
duplication
that
state
workman’s
compensation
coverage
had
grown
by
leaps
and
bounce,
and
that
this
duplication
was
posing
a
serious
problem
both
from
the
point
of
view
of
purposes
of
the
social
security
act
which
i
shall
discuss
shortly
and
from
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
an
increase
in
the
number
of
the
amount
of
state
coverage
and
as
well
in
the
amount
of
benefits
provided.
now,
i
think,
it
is
also
worth
noting
that,
though
i
think
it
is
quite
clear
that
congress
did
not
have
to
do
so.
it
did,
in
fact,
restrict
the
offset
provision
contained
in
section
224,
the
persons
whose
injuries
occurred
after
the
date
of
statute
and
thus
who
had
not
come
to
rely
upon
a
receipt
of
a
certain
amount
of
income
which
will
then
be
later
on
lowered.
appellee's
injury
occurred
in
1968
and
so
that
in
order
to
attack
the
application
of
section
224
to
this
case,
he
must
argue
as
i
suppose
he
does,
and
either
that
the
original
section
224
was
unconstitutional
and
its
inclusion
of
an
offset
provision
or
that
the
temporary
repeal
of
that
provision
in
some
way
forever
precluded
congress
from
restoring
an
offset
or
from
reducing
the
maximum
allowable
benefit
with
respect
to
an
individual
claimant.
i
think,
that
it
is
not
an
exaggeration
and
it
does
not
need
much
elaboration
to
say
that
the
holding
of
the
court
below
on
this
point,
that
congress
cannot
in
effect
include
an
offset
provision
in
this
kind
of
statute
or
reduce
benefits
which
are
theoretically
and
potentially
in
the
statute,
would
throw
into
chaos,
a
great
number
of
the
social
security
and
welfare
programs
enforced
today
virtually,
all
of
which
by
necessity
compute
their
benefits
in
terms
of
offsets
and
reductions
which
are
geared
to
the
legislative
view
of
need
and
which
are
designed
to
provide
the
most
effective
distribution
of
limited
funds.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
that
is
what
i
am,
exactly
what
i
am
getting
into
now,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
the
second
ground
which
the
district
court
relied
upon
in
which
the
appellant's
raise
to
invalidate
section
224
is
based
upon
the
claim,
that
section
224
discriminates
invidiously
between
the
workman’s
compensation,
recipients
of
workman’s
compensation
benefits
whose
social
security
disability
benefits
maybe
reduced
in
certain
circumstances
and
recipients
of
any
other
type
of
relief
such
as
tort
recovery
and
private
insurance
policy
whose
social
security
disability
benefits
are
not
thereby
reduced.
now,
with
respect
to
this
argument,
which
i
suppose
is
really
the
key
argument
in
the
case,
i
would
like
the
outset
to
reiterate
to
very
well
known
and
related
equal
protection
concepts
which
have
been
repeatedly
affirmed
by
this
court
and
which
are
quite
clearly
at
--
i
would
even
say,
perhaps
are
classically
applicable
to
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
one
of
these
is
the
concept
that
legislative
reform
such
as
congress
had
in
mind
in
the
offset
provision
section
224,
is
not
invidiously
discriminatory
merely
because
it
is
not
going
far
enough.
in
other
words,
even
if
the
reasons
which
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
formulated
the
offset
provision
such
as
to
avoid
excessive
benefits
and
encourage
the
rehabilitation
of
workers,
even
if
those
reasons
are
equally
applicable
to
recipients
of
other
kinds
of
other
kinds
of
disability
recovery
and
i
will
show
shortly
that
congress
did
not
believe
that
they
were
equally
applicable.
congress
is
failure
to
acquire
the
offset
of
these
other
benefits,
it
is
not
by
itself
wherein
the
section
224
unconstitutional.
this
court,
i
suppose,
the
classic
statement
of
that
was
williams
v.
the
optical
company
in
which
a
348
u.s.
in
which
the
court
said
that
the
reform
may
take
one
step
at
a
time
addressing
itself
based
the
problem
which
seems
most
acute
to
the
legislative
mind.
and
in
this
case,
the
legislative
history
which
we
had
referred
to
a
link
in
our
brief
shows,
i
think,
clearly
that
the
problem
which
was
most
acute
in
congress’s
mind
was,
in
fact,
the
high
percentage
of
disability
recipients
whose
simultaneous
workman’s
compensation
benefits
brought
their
combined
receipts
from
those
two
sources,
well
above,
their
pre-injury
salaries
and
incomes.
and
i
suggest
it
is
natural
enough
that
congress
would
have
focused
primarily
on
workman’s
compensation,
since
these
programs
have
really
become
very,
very
wide
spread
are
now
in
operation
in
all
states
and
jurisdiction
for
the
united
states
and
in
many
states
are
in
fact
compulsory.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
that
the
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
he
has
casualty
insurance
or
indeed
receipts
from
any
kind
of
program
other
than
a
workman’s
compensation
program.
he
will
get
them
both
and
i
am
about
to
explain
but
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
am
just
about
to
read
out
that,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
would
read
the
bulk
of
the
rest
of
my
argument
about
that.
just
to
bear
remind
the
second,
and
this
is
perhaps
the
most
important
concept
applicable
in
this
area,
all
together,
it
is
that,
in
a
context
which
does
not
involved
what
this
court
has
called
fundamental
constitutional
rights
and
a
context
in
which
the
classification
is
not
a
suspect
in
any
grounds,
for
example,
of
race
or
religion
which
i
clearly
take
it
--
no
one
claims
what
this
classification
is.
in
that
context,
a
statutory
classification
is
not
invalid
merely
because
it
is
rough
or
imperfect
in
some
respect,
but
only
if
that
classification
cannot
be
rationally
justified
on
any
ground,
whatsoever.
this
court
has
quite
reasonably
applied
that
in
notion
to
the
area
of
social
welfare
in
dandridge
v.
williams
decided
at
397
u.s.
and
of
course
in
flemming
v.
nestor
at
363
u.s.,
in
dandridge,
the
court
held
valid
under
the
equal
protection
clause
a
statutory
scheme
which
promised
eligibility
for
assistance
under
the
aid
to
dependent
children
program
on
the
basis
of
the
number
of
dependent
children
but
then
set
a
maximum
amount
of
benefit
that
could
be
recovered
regardless
of
the
number
of
children,
and
i
submit
that
this
place
in
which
the
provision,
the
offset
provision,
in
question
is
not
even
applicable
unless
the
very
standard
of
need
which
congress
has
defined
which
is
80%
of
prior
earnings
has
been
met,
is
considerably
easier
to
decide
really
on
both
of
the
grounds
raised
by
the
appellees
in
the
court
below
than
is
dandridge
and
williams
and
it
is
far
easy
to
decide
than
that
in
flemming
and
nestor.
i
think
that
appellees
in
the
court
below
raised
a
number
of
interesting
questions
with
respect
to
what
mr.
justice
marshall
has
just
asked,
a
number
of
interesting
questions
with
respect
to
the
wisdom
of
congress's
decision
to
apply
section
224
to
recipients
of
workman’s
compensation
only.
but
i
think
that
their
arguments
have
in
no
way
casted
out
upon
the
constitutionality
of
section
224
because
the
offended
funded
legislative
history
in
this
area
shows
that
congress
indeed
had
a
perfectly
plausible,
even
if
debatable
rationale
for
singling
out
duplicating
benefits
arising
from
workman’s
compensation
programs.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
what
it
shows,
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
shows
like
reference
to,
some
reference
to
these
other
problems
and
we
have
decided
those
in
our
brief.
its
primary
focus
was
on
the
workman’s
compensation
problem
and
--
but
i
think
it
is
important
to
note
that
the
reasons
why
it
especially
wanted
to
avoid
duplication
in
the
workman’s
compensation
area
are
not
applicable
to
these
other
areas.
so,
that
congress
did
focus
on
certain
specific
reasons
which
would
not
have
been
applicable
to
other
areas.
at
every
stage
of
the
history
of
this
provision,
congress
considered
volumes
of
testimony
to
the
effect
that
if
excessive
duplication
of
benefits
were
allowed,
many
states
would
eliminate
or
seriously
curtail
the
coverage
of
their
workman’s
compensation
programs,
and
the
reason
for
this
is
that
the
states
will
inevitably
want
to
avoid
excessive
duplication,
and
to
encourage
rehabilitation.
and
that
theory
would
not
be
true
with
the
disable
workers
themselves.
it
is
perfectly
natural
that
the
disabled
workers
themselves
are
perfectly
happy
to
get
better
benefits
after
their
injury
than
before.
they
are
not
going
to
have
any
particular
interest
in
rehabilitation,
really,
only
the
state
administering
a
state
run
program
is
going
to
be
watching
after
that
interest,
so
that
alternative
roots
to
federal
coverage
will
really
only
be
cut
off
in
areas
which
are
governed
by
the
states.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
it
is
possible
that
they
could
do
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
regulations
incidentally,
the
hew
regulations
quite
fairly
provide
for
that
circumstance.
there
are
one
or
two
states
which
already
do
that
and
in
those
circumstances,
the
benefits
are
not
offset
state
workman’s
compensation
benefits
are
not
offset
if
the
state
itself
has
an
offset
provision
geared
to
the
federal
program.
otherwise,
you
will
get
involved
in
an
endless
round
about
arguments
that
will
have
no
conclusion
and
i
guess
congress
just
took
it
upon
itself
and
then
hew
took
it
upon
itself
to
foreclose
that
possibility.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
that
is
right.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that
is
right.
i
would
add
another
rationale
which
we
illustrated
in
our
brief
is
that
the
congress
has
really
from
the
inception
of
the
social
security
program
attempted
not
to
discourage
potential
claimants
from
procuring
the
protection
through
private
means
such
as
insurance.
it
appears
that
this
consideration,
the
interest
in
maintaining
other
alternative
methods
to
federal
protection
has
really
outweighed
congress's
interest
with
respect
to
private
insurance
tort
recovery
and
so
on
has
outweighed
congress’s
interest
in
awarding
duplicating
benefits.
indeed,
if
you
take
as
the
overall
rationale
which
i
think
comes
quite
naturally
out
of
the
legislative
history,
that
everything
congress
has
done
in
this
area
has
reflected
an
interest
in
encouraging
the
maintenance
of
non-federal
sources
of
this
recovery
with
this
interest
in
mind
the
decision
to
acquire
offset
in
the
case
of
workman’s
compensation
recoveries
but
not
in
other
cases,
it
seems
sensible
enough
even
if
its
conclusions
are
arguable.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
am
not
sure
whether
they
would
say
that
we
would
deduct
everything
or
that
the
offset
provision
would
simply
be
eliminated
and
they
would
cover
everything
which
will
have
the
most
unfortunate
effect
in
many
ways,
or
whether
simply
they
would
reduce
benefits
across
the
board
in
some
way.
it
is
very
speculative
is
to
what
they
would
do.
there
are
many
of
the
other
rationales
in
support
of
section
224
and
several
of
which
are
developed
by
the
sixth
circuit
in
the
lofty
and
richardson
case
decided
at
440
at
the
second
to
which
i
would
further
quote
many
of
those
are
quite
interesting
suggestions
of
possible
rationales
i
have
focused
here,
and
we
have
focused
primarily
in
our
brief
on
those
rationales
which
were
quite
clearly
before
congress
when
it
considered
the
statute,
not
that
it
is
necessary
to
support
the
statute
in
this
area
purely
in
the
basis
of
actually
considered
rationale.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
i
do
not
entirely
know
the
answer
to
that
mr.
justice
white,
but
what
i
have
been
able
to
gather
this
occurred
in
a
time
in
which
there
was
not
as
widespread
of
coverage
in
the
workman’s
compensation
claims
before,
it
was
part
of
the
ongoing
(voice
overlap).
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes,
and
they
were
too
low
and
it
was
part
of
the
ongoing
federal
social
security
program
to
cover
as
many
areas
of
hard
core
need
as
the
federal
government
(voice
overlap).
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that
is
my
understanding
and
those
shortcomings
have
to
some
extent
been
alleviated
in
recent
years
though
i
suppose
that
it
is
not
the
point
where
federal
coverage
is
no
longer
necessary,
at
least
congress
is
not
(voice
overlap).
mr.
richard
b.
stone
of
their
prior
earnings
and
in
fact
it
is
pretty
close
to
their
entire
take
home
80%
of
gross.
in
conclusion,
i
believe
that
we
have
established
that
the
only
real
questions
raised
by
appellees
and
by
the
court
below
are
not
as
to
whether
section
224
is
constitutional
but
simply
is
to
whether
it
is
the
wisest
scheme
which
congress
could
have
adopted.
if
that
is
debatable,
i
think
it
is
quite
wise
scheme
in
fact.
in
any
event
that
issue
is
not
to
before
this
court
and
for
that
reason,
i
believe
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
nothing
further.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
which
is
on
direct
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
from
the
southern
district
of
west
virginia
is
in
a
somewhat
unusual
posture
and
that
a
single
judge
district
court
has
declared
unconstitutional
section
224,
the
social
security
act.
in
the
more
normal
instance
of
course,
an
adjudication
that
a
federal
statute
is
unconstitutional,
would
originate
and
direct
appeal
would
be
taken
from
a
pre-judge
court.
this
court
has
held;
however
in
a
closely
similar
context
in
flemming
v.
nestor
reported
at
363
u.s.
and
in
other
cases
as
well.
that
a
pre-judge
court
is
not
mandatory
under
28
u.s.c
2282,
when
an
action
based
on
the
alleged
unconstitutionality
of
the
federal
statute,
does
not
seek
to
enjoin
the
operation
of
statutory
scheme,
but
merely
to
acquire
the
payment
of
some
benefit
afforded
by
that
scheme
and
the
court
has
invariably
retained
direct
appeals
in
these
circumstances
and
no
question
has
been
raised
by
other
side
as
to
jurisdiction,
and
i
take
it
that
there
is
none.
in
this
case,
the
provision
in
question,
section
224
of
the
social
security
act,
provides
that
social
security
disability
benefits,
which
caused
by
roughly
to
lost
earnings
resulting
from
the
claimant’s
disability
must
be
reduced
according
to
a
fairly
complex
formula
by
virtue
of
the
recipient’s
simultaneous
receipt
of
periodic
workman’s
compensation
benefits
under
a
state
of
federal
workman’s
compensation
plan,
in
the
ordinary
case,
of
course,
it
is
the
state
plan.
the
offset
provision
only
applies
for
purposes
relevant
here.
if
the
total
of
the
claimant’s
social
security
disability
benefits
and
his
workman’s
compensation
benefits
exceed
80%
of
his
average
monthly
earnings
and
that
is
gross
earnings
without
taking
into
account
tax
computations
acquired
to
injury.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
excuse
me.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yeah,
the
average
monthly
earning
is
computed
on
a
five
year
period.
and,
benefits
are
only
reduced
in
so
far
as
they
exceed
80%
of
those
earnings,
and
of
course,
the
actual
effect
for
anyone
whose
tax
status
put
him
--
causes
him
pay
income
tax,
in
excess
of
20%
of
his
gross
salary,
actually
comes
out
even
with
the
80%,
comes
out
with
more
and
take
home
pay
that
he
had
acquired
through
his
injury.
the
appellee
in
this
case
mr.
belcher
became
disabled
in
1968
and
was
awarded
at
$330
a
month
in
social
security
and
disability
benefits
without
regard
to
any
workman’s
compensation,
and
the
secretary
had
no
notice
of
his
receipt
of
workman’s
compensation
at
that
time
and
that
award
was
made
in
october
of
1968.
three
months
later,
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare,
notified
mr.
belcher
that
his
federal
benefits
would
be
reduced
by
a
$104
a
month
because
of
his
simultaneous
receipt
of
$203
per
month
in
state
workman’s
compensation
benefits.
the
scheme
is
quite
simple,
without
the
offset,
mr.
belcher
would
have
received
a
total
of
$534
in
social
security
and
workman’s
compensation
benefits
which
would
have
been
a
100%
of
his
prior
gross
earnings,
and
as
a
result
of
the
offset,
his
benefits
total
to
$430
or
exactly
80%
of
his
average
prior
earnings.
mr.
belcher
requested
a
hearing
to
challenge
the
reduction
of
his
federal
benefits
and
the
hearing
was
held
before
a
hearing
examiner
at
which
appellee
was
represented
by
an
attorney,
who
i
believe
represents
him
here
in
this
court
today.
the
hearing
examiner
upheld
the
reduction
and
this
ruling
became
in
the
normal
course
of
hew
administrator
rulings,
the
final
decision
of
the
secretary
of
hew.
i
believe
he
then
brought
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
under
section
405
or
42
u.s.c.
405g
to
reveal
(somebody
coughed)
the
secretary’s
administrative
decision.
and
i
take
it
that
at
no
point
in
the
court
below
or
in
the
administrative
process
has
appellee
denied
in
any
aspect
of
the
factual
or
legal
basis
which
underlay
the
secretary’s
determination
that
section
224
applied
to
him
and
precisely
the
manner
in
which
hew
applied
it.
nor
has
appellee
raised
any
question
whatsoever
as
to
the
procedural
rights,
such
as
an
evidentiary
hearing
which
has
been
fully
afforded
to
him.
his
sole
contention
and
the
sole
ground
of
decision
in
the
district
court
below
was
that
it
is
unconstitutional,
as
a
substantive
matter
for
congress
to
reduce
social
security
disability
benefits
by
virtue
of
workman’s
compensation
benefits.
in
upholding
appellee’s
claim,
the
court
below
stands
alone
and
it
odds
with
eight
other
district
courts,
at
least
eight
other
district
courts
that
have
routinely
ruled
on
this
question
and
with
their
recent
decision
of
the
6th
circuit
court
of
appeals,
which
has
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
section
224.
now,
the
court
arrived
at
its
decision
that
section
224
is
unconstitutional
on
essentially
two
grounds.
the
first
of
these
grounds,
i
believe,
can
be
dealt
with
rather
briefly
and
i
think
it
reflects
a
misconception
of
certain
decisions
of
this
court
which
are
to
be
pretty
readily
apparent
here.
in
goldberg
versus
kelly,
at
397
u.s.,
this
court
held
it
when
the
administrators
of
a
state
welfare
program,
in
that
case
it
was
the
aid
to
dependent
children
program,
determined
that
a
particular
recipient
no
longer
qualifies
for
benefits
under
the
statutory
standards
governing
that
program,
those
benefits
that
cannot
be
cut
off
until
the
recipient
has
been
given
some
sort
of
an
evidentiary
hearing.
this
court
reasoned
in
goldberg
that
a
welfare
recipient
in
the
adc
program
has
at
least,
a
sufficient
right
whether
you
call
it
a
property
right
or
whatever
you
call
it,
in
those
benefits,
so
that
it
violates
standard
notions
or
procedural
due
process
to
cut
off
those
benefits
summarily
without
any
kind
of
a
proceeding.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no,
no
claim
whatsoever,
mr.
justice
brennan.
it
maybe
said,
i
suppose
that
goldberg,
what
goldberg
did
was
put
to
a
final
rest.
a
theory
that
really
the
government
had
not
attempted
to
make
in
a
welfare
context
for
sometime,
that
those
benefits
are
really
a
privilege
rather
that
a
right
and
if
that
automatically
cuts
off
any
procedural
difficulty
in
simply
taking
them
away.
and
i
think,
that
that
document
has
been
laid
to
rest
and
those
extractions
happily
are
not
issue
here.
however,
this
district
court
through
a
process
that
is
not
entirely
elaborated
and
which
is
somewhat
mystical
to
me,
reasons
on
the
basis
of
goldberg
and
kelly
that
congress
cannot
build
into
the
statutory
formula
for
computing
social
security
disability
benefits,
which
it
analogizes
to
welfare
benefits.
any
circumstances
which
would
reduce
the
maximum
allowable
benefit.
now,
without
going
into
the
applicability
of
goldberg
and
kelly
to
social
security
programs,
a
question
which
we
assume
be
before
this
court
in
which
certiorari
was
granted
yesterday,
i
gather.
i
think,
it
is
safe
to
say
that
goldberg
and
kelly
which
dealt
entirely
with
procedural
rights
are
not
in
question
here,
but
in
no
way
implies
a
limitation
on
the
legislative
authority
to
device
a
reasonable
substantive
formula
for
determining
the
proper
amount
of
social
security
benefits
owed
to
any
claimant.
in
other
words,
from
goldberg
and
kelly
which
is
applied
to
this
case,
i
suppose,
might
preclude
hew
from
cutting
off
the
claimant’s
benefits
without
a
hearing.
it
is
very,
very
long
steps
to
the
notion
that
that
claimant
has
a
vested
interest
in
the
maximum
amount
of
benefit
which
statute
ever
even
potentially
afforded
to
him
or
the
notion
that
congress
can
attach
no
other
qualifications
to
the
statutory
standard
which
governs
the
amount
of
benefits
owing
to
the
claimant.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that
is
right.
that
is
right
mr.
justice
marshall.
this
is
the
statutory
standard
and
it
is
the
statutory
standard
which
mr.
belcher
brings
to
question
here
and
i
wish
the
district
judge
ruled.
as
a
matter
of
fact
here
it
shows
in
the
record
that
this
hearing
process
was,
i
suppose,
essentially
a
little
useless
since
the
ground
that
was
being
claimed
was
the
unconstitutionally
of
the
statute
and
the
hearing
examiner
noted
several
times
that
you
do
not
seem
to
bring
in
the
question
anything
about
your
applicability
to
the
statute.
now,
it
is
interesting
to
know,
just
put
this
in
perspective,
that
when
disability
benefits
were
first
introduced
into
the
social
security
program
in
1956,
recipients
were
required
to
offset
the
full
amount
of
workman’s
compensation
benefits
regardless
of
whether
the
total
of
disability
and
workman’s
compensation
exceeded
any
specified
limit.
that
provision
was
temporarily
repealed
in
1958
and
then
reenacted
in
1965
with
the
current
proviso
that
the
benefits
will
not
be
reduced
unless
the
total
of
the
two
types
of
programs
equals
80%
of
prior
earnings,
and
i
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
their
legislative
history
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes,
we
talked
--
.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
it
was
repealed
in
1958,
essentially
because
there
was
a
testimony
in
legislative
hearings
to
the
effect
that
there
really
were
not
that
many
instances
of
duplication.
i
have
pointed
out
that
the
workman’s
compensation
program
is
very
much
expanded
since
then.
it
was
thought
that
the
offset
was
somewhat
experimental
when
it
was
passed
in
1956.
in
1958,
congress
was
persuaded
in
some
way
that
there
simply
were
not
enough
instances
of
duplication
to
(inaudible)
to
go
through
the
administrative
difficulty
of
enforcing
these
offset
provisions.
now,
between
1958
and
1965,
there
were
volumes,
and
volumes
of
testimony
to
which
we
refer
in
our
brief
to
the
effect
that
in
fact
there
was
a
serious
amount
of
duplication
that
state
workman’s
compensation
coverage
had
grown
by
leaps
and
bounce,
and
that
this
duplication
was
posing
a
serious
problem
both
from
the
point
of
view
of
purposes
of
the
social
security
act
which
i
shall
discuss
shortly
and
from
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
an
increase
in
the
number
of
the
amount
of
state
coverage
and
as
well
in
the
amount
of
benefits
provided.
now,
i
think,
it
is
also
worth
noting
that,
though
i
think
it
is
quite
clear
that
congress
did
not
have
to
do
so.
it
did,
in
fact,
restrict
the
offset
provision
contained
in
section
224,
the
persons
whose
injuries
occurred
after
the
date
of
statute
and
thus
who
had
not
come
to
rely
upon
a
receipt
of
a
certain
amount
of
income
which
will
then
be
later
on
lowered.
appellee's
injury
occurred
in
1968
and
so
that
in
order
to
attack
the
application
of
section
224
to
this
case,
he
must
argue
as
i
suppose
he
does,
and
either
that
the
original
section
224
was
unconstitutional
and
its
inclusion
of
an
offset
provision
or
that
the
temporary
repeal
of
that
provision
in
some
way
forever
precluded
congress
from
restoring
an
offset
or
from
reducing
the
maximum
allowable
benefit
with
respect
to
an
individual
claimant.
i
think,
that
it
is
not
an
exaggeration
and
it
does
not
need
much
elaboration
to
say
that
the
holding
of
the
court
below
on
this
point,
that
congress
cannot
in
effect
include
an
offset
provision
in
this
kind
of
statute
or
reduce
benefits
which
are
theoretically
and
potentially
in
the
statute,
would
throw
into
chaos,
a
great
number
of
the
social
security
and
welfare
programs
enforced
today
virtually,
all
of
which
by
necessity
compute
their
benefits
in
terms
of
offsets
and
reductions
which
are
geared
to
the
legislative
view
of
need
and
which
are
designed
to
provide
the
most
effective
distribution
of
limited
funds.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
that
is
what
i
am,
exactly
what
i
am
getting
into
now,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
the
second
ground
which
the
district
court
relied
upon
in
which
the
appellant's
raise
to
invalidate
section
224
is
based
upon
the
claim,
that
section
224
discriminates
invidiously
between
the
workman’s
compensation,
recipients
of
workman’s
compensation
benefits
whose
social
security
disability
benefits
maybe
reduced
in
certain
circumstances
and
recipients
of
any
other
type
of
relief
such
as
tort
recovery
and
private
insurance
policy
whose
social
security
disability
benefits
are
not
thereby
reduced.
now,
with
respect
to
this
argument,
which
i
suppose
is
really
the
key
argument
in
the
case,
i
would
like
the
outset
to
reiterate
to
very
well
known
and
related
equal
protection
concepts
which
have
been
repeatedly
affirmed
by
this
court
and
which
are
quite
clearly
at
--
i
would
even
say,
perhaps
are
classically
applicable
to
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
one
of
these
is
the
concept
that
legislative
reform
such
as
congress
had
in
mind
in
the
offset
provision
section
224,
is
not
invidiously
discriminatory
merely
because
it
is
not
going
far
enough.
in
other
words,
even
if
the
reasons
which
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
formulated
the
offset
provision
such
as
to
avoid
excessive
benefits
and
encourage
the
rehabilitation
of
workers,
even
if
those
reasons
are
equally
applicable
to
recipients
of
other
kinds
of
other
kinds
of
disability
recovery
and
i
will
show
shortly
that
congress
did
not
believe
that
they
were
equally
applicable.
congress
is
failure
to
acquire
the
offset
of
these
other
benefits,
it
is
not
by
itself
wherein
the
section
224
unconstitutional.
this
court,
i
suppose,
the
classic
statement
of
that
was
williams
v.
the
optical
company
in
which
a
348
u.s.
in
which
the
court
said
that
the
reform
may
take
one
step
at
a
time
addressing
itself
based
the
problem
which
seems
most
acute
to
the
legislative
mind.
and
in
this
case,
the
legislative
history
which
we
had
referred
to
a
link
in
our
brief
shows,
i
think,
clearly
that
the
problem
which
was
most
acute
in
congress’s
mind
was,
in
fact,
the
high
percentage
of
disability
recipients
whose
simultaneous
workman’s
compensation
benefits
brought
their
combined
receipts
from
those
two
sources,
well
above,
their
pre-injury
salaries
and
incomes.
and
i
suggest
it
is
natural
enough
that
congress
would
have
focused
primarily
on
workman’s
compensation,
since
these
programs
have
really
become
very,
very
wide
spread
are
now
in
operation
in
all
states
and
jurisdiction
for
the
united
states
and
in
many
states
are
in
fact
compulsory.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
that
the
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
he
has
casualty
insurance
or
indeed
receipts
from
any
kind
of
program
other
than
a
workman’s
compensation
program.
he
will
get
them
both
and
i
am
about
to
explain
but
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
am
just
about
to
read
out
that,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
would
read
the
bulk
of
the
rest
of
my
argument
about
that.
just
to
bear
remind
the
second,
and
this
is
perhaps
the
most
important
concept
applicable
in
this
area,
all
together,
it
is
that,
in
a
context
which
does
not
involved
what
this
court
has
called
fundamental
constitutional
rights
and
a
context
in
which
the
classification
is
not
a
suspect
in
any
grounds,
for
example,
of
race
or
religion
which
i
clearly
take
it
--
no
one
claims
what
this
classification
is.
in
that
context,
a
statutory
classification
is
not
invalid
merely
because
it
is
rough
or
imperfect
in
some
respect,
but
only
if
that
classification
cannot
be
rationally
justified
on
any
ground,
whatsoever.
this
court
has
quite
reasonably
applied
that
in
notion
to
the
area
of
social
welfare
in
dandridge
v.
williams
decided
at
397
u.s.
and
of
course
in
flemming
v.
nestor
at
363
u.s.,
in
dandridge,
the
court
held
valid
under
the
equal
protection
clause
a
statutory
scheme
which
promised
eligibility
for
assistance
under
the
aid
to
dependent
children
program
on
the
basis
of
the
number
of
dependent
children
but
then
set
a
maximum
amount
of
benefit
that
could
be
recovered
regardless
of
the
number
of
children,
and
i
submit
that
this
place
in
which
the
provision,
the
offset
provision,
in
question
is
not
even
applicable
unless
the
very
standard
of
need
which
congress
has
defined
which
is
80%
of
prior
earnings
has
been
met,
is
considerably
easier
to
decide
really
on
both
of
the
grounds
raised
by
the
appellees
in
the
court
below
than
is
dandridge
and
williams
and
it
is
far
easy
to
decide
than
that
in
flemming
and
nestor.
i
think
that
appellees
in
the
court
below
raised
a
number
of
interesting
questions
with
respect
to
what
mr.
justice
marshall
has
just
asked,
a
number
of
interesting
questions
with
respect
to
the
wisdom
of
congress's
decision
to
apply
section
224
to
recipients
of
workman’s
compensation
only.
but
i
think
that
their
arguments
have
in
no
way
casted
out
upon
the
constitutionality
of
section
224
because
the
offended
funded
legislative
history
in
this
area
shows
that
congress
indeed
had
a
perfectly
plausible,
even
if
debatable
rationale
for
singling
out
duplicating
benefits
arising
from
workman’s
compensation
programs.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
what
it
shows,
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
shows
like
reference
to,
some
reference
to
these
other
problems
and
we
have
decided
those
in
our
brief.
its
primary
focus
was
on
the
workman’s
compensation
problem
and
--
but
i
think
it
is
important
to
note
that
the
reasons
why
it
especially
wanted
to
avoid
duplication
in
the
workman’s
compensation
area
are
not
applicable
to
these
other
areas.
so,
that
congress
did
focus
on
certain
specific
reasons
which
would
not
have
been
applicable
to
other
areas.
at
every
stage
of
the
history
of
this
provision,
congress
considered
volumes
of
testimony
to
the
effect
that
if
excessive
duplication
of
benefits
were
allowed,
many
states
would
eliminate
or
seriously
curtail
the
coverage
of
their
workman’s
compensation
programs,
and
the
reason
for
this
is
that
the
states
will
inevitably
want
to
avoid
excessive
duplication,
and
to
encourage
rehabilitation.
and
that
theory
would
not
be
true
with
the
disable
workers
themselves.
it
is
perfectly
natural
that
the
disabled
workers
themselves
are
perfectly
happy
to
get
better
benefits
after
their
injury
than
before.
they
are
not
going
to
have
any
particular
interest
in
rehabilitation,
really,
only
the
state
administering
a
state
run
program
is
going
to
be
watching
after
that
interest,
so
that
alternative
roots
to
federal
coverage
will
really
only
be
cut
off
in
areas
which
are
governed
by
the
states.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
it
is
possible
that
they
could
do
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
regulations
incidentally,
the
hew
regulations
quite
fairly
provide
for
that
circumstance.
there
are
one
or
two
states
which
already
do
that
and
in
those
circumstances,
the
benefits
are
not
offset
state
workman’s
compensation
benefits
are
not
offset
if
the
state
itself
has
an
offset
provision
geared
to
the
federal
program.
otherwise,
you
will
get
involved
in
an
endless
round
about
arguments
that
will
have
no
conclusion
and
i
guess
congress
just
took
it
upon
itself
and
then
hew
took
it
upon
itself
to
foreclose
that
possibility.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
that
is
right.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that
is
right.
i
would
add
another
rationale
which
we
illustrated
in
our
brief
is
that
the
congress
has
really
from
the
inception
of
the
social
security
program
attempted
not
to
discourage
potential
claimants
from
procuring
the
protection
through
private
means
such
as
insurance.
it
appears
that
this
consideration,
the
interest
in
maintaining
other
alternative
methods
to
federal
protection
has
really
outweighed
congress's
interest
with
respect
to
private
insurance
tort
recovery
and
so
on
has
outweighed
congress’s
interest
in
awarding
duplicating
benefits.
indeed,
if
you
take
as
the
overall
rationale
which
i
think
comes
quite
naturally
out
of
the
legislative
history,
that
everything
congress
has
done
in
this
area
has
reflected
an
interest
in
encouraging
the
maintenance
of
non-federal
sources
of
this
recovery
with
this
interest
in
mind
the
decision
to
acquire
offset
in
the
case
of
workman’s
compensation
recoveries
but
not
in
other
cases,
it
seems
sensible
enough
even
if
its
conclusions
are
arguable.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
am
not
sure
whether
they
would
say
that
we
would
deduct
everything
or
that
the
offset
provision
would
simply
be
eliminated
and
they
would
cover
everything
which
will
have
the
most
unfortunate
effect
in
many
ways,
or
whether
simply
they
would
reduce
benefits
across
the
board
in
some
way.
it
is
very
speculative
is
to
what
they
would
do.
there
are
many
of
the
other
rationales
in
support
of
section
224
and
several
of
which
are
developed
by
the
sixth
circuit
in
the
lofty
and
richardson
case
decided
at
440
at
the
second
to
which
i
would
further
quote
many
of
those
are
quite
interesting
suggestions
of
possible
rationales
i
have
focused
here,
and
we
have
focused
primarily
in
our
brief
on
those
rationales
which
were
quite
clearly
before
congress
when
it
considered
the
statute,
not
that
it
is
necessary
to
support
the
statute
in
this
area
purely
in
the
basis
of
actually
considered
rationale.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
i
do
not
entirely
know
the
answer
to
that
mr.
justice
white,
but
what
i
have
been
able
to
gather
this
occurred
in
a
time
in
which
there
was
not
as
widespread
of
coverage
in
the
workman’s
compensation
claims
before,
it
was
part
of
the
ongoing
(voice
overlap).
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes,
and
they
were
too
low
and
it
was
part
of
the
ongoing
federal
social
security
program
to
cover
as
many
areas
of
hard
core
need
as
the
federal
government
(voice
overlap).
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that
is
my
understanding
and
those
shortcomings
have
to
some
extent
been
alleviated
in
recent
years
though
i
suppose
that
it
is
not
the
point
where
federal
coverage
is
no
longer
necessary,
at
least
congress
is
not
(voice
overlap).
mr.
richard
b.
stone
of
their
prior
earnings
and
in
fact
it
is
pretty
close
to
their
entire
take
home
80%
of
gross.
in
conclusion,
i
believe
that
we
have
established
that
the
only
real
questions
raised
by
appellees
and
by
the
court
below
are
not
as
to
whether
section
224
is
constitutional
but
simply
is
to
whether
it
is
the
wisest
scheme
which
congress
could
have
adopted.
if
that
is
debatable,
i
think
it
is
quite
wise
scheme
in
fact.
in
any
event
that
issue
is
not
to
before
this
court
and
for
that
reason,
i
believe
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
nothing
further.
