mr.
john
charles
harris
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court,
the
district
court
interpreting
goldberg
versus
kelly
has
determined
the
welfare
was
a
property
right,
and
therefore
protected
by
due
property
clause,
however
to
distinguish
between
welfare
and
social
security
was
illogical,
and
grossly
inequitable,
and
further
they
held
that
section
224,
of
the
social
security
act
arbitrarily
discriminated
between
the
disabled
worker
and
other
disabled
persons.
therefore
violating
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
and
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
addition
to
this,
the
district
court
also
stated
that
the
workman’s
compensation
law
and
the
state
of
west
virginia
is
very
unique
in
so
far
as
this
is
a
voluntary
law
where
the
employer
and
the
employee
voluntarily
go
into
this
particular
act
and
go
into
the
act,
and
therefore
as
such,
the
highest
court
in
the
state
of
west
virginia
has
held
that
this
is
an
integral
part
of
the
contract
between
the
employer
and
employee
and
the
act
of
receiving
benefits
or
not
receiving
benefits
under
the
social
security
act
and
in
this
particular
case,
mr.
belcher
his
payments
were
reduced
in
violation
of
his
contract
with
his
employer
as
covered
under
the
compensation
act
of
the
state
of
west
virginia.
mr.
john
charles
harris
now,
once
the
election
is
made,
he
looses
his
right
to
sue.
he
looses
his
(voice
overlap).
mr.
john
charles
harris
when
he
goes
--
actually,
in
most
cases
--
here
in
this
particular
case
there
was
a
union
election.
but
otherwise,
i
presumed
the
burden
is
on
the
employer
to
accept
the
workman’s
compensation
law
and
then
posting
a
notice
to
the
employees
and
that
i
am
under
the
law,
and
therefore
if
you
work
for
me
you
are
waiving
your
common
law
right.
mr.
john
charles
harris
it
is
a
state
fund.
but
the
contributions
come
from
the
employers.
it
is
not
public
funds.
it
is
the
administered
as
a
trust
fund
with
the
money
coming
from
the
employers.
mr.
john
charles
harris
no
state
cost.
mr.
john
charles
harris
no,
it
is
a
fund
administered
by
the
funds
that
are
received
from
the
employer
and
each
employer
pays
a
premium
if
you
want
to
call
it
that,on
the
payroll
that
he
pays
to
his
employees.
very
similar
to
the
other
states
that
they
have
an
insurance
policy,
their
rate
is
applied
to
the
amount
of
payroll
and
they
pay
the
--
and
that's
the
basis
of
their
insurance,
payment
to
the
insurance
company.
mr.
john
charles
harris
yes,
it
does.
it
does
differentiate
between
a
private
insurance
for
which
he
would
pay
the
premium.
but
it
does
not
differentiate
from
other
states
where
the
employer
pays
the
premium
on
the
workman’s
compensation
insurance.
in
other
states
in
--
there
are
only
six
states
that
have
state
funds.
the
other
44
states
do
have
insurance.
for
insurance,
the
employer
buys
insurance,
pays
forth
fully
and
this
covers
the
employee
in
the
event
of
industrial
accident.
the
appellant
contends
that
the
goldberg
which
is
the
basis
of
the
decision
in
a
district
court
strictly
applied
to
a
procedure
requirement
and
further
it
contended
the
discrimination
was
justified
--
justifying
the
discrimination
against
disabled
workers
as
compared
to
other
disabled
people.
so
this
was
justified,
so
otherwise
it
would
not
weaken
workman’s
compensation
laws.
and
quite
to
contrary
it
is
true,
as
pointed
out
by
mr.
chief
justice
here,
that
the
states
are
and
will
in
the
future
reduce
their
workman’s
compensation
benefits
and
therefore
weaken
the
law
to
enable
less
money
from
them
and
more
money
from
the
federal
government
in
the
form
of
the
social
security
laws.
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
would
say
that
the
state
is
subject
to
the
same
pressures
from
employers,
from
the
organizations,
i
am
noticing
in
the
brief
here,
most
of
the
opposition
to
the
repeal
of
this
section
224
came
from
the
national
association
of
manufacturers.
it
came
from
that
the
chamber
of
commerce
and
i
think,
the
same
thing
could
apply
in
a
particular
state
where
a
national
association
manufacturer’s,
chambers
of
commerce
other
employers
could
pressure
the
legislators
to
reduce
the
amount
of
payment
for
disability
on
the
social
security
and
in
fact
save
them
the
expense.
since
the
rates
are
based
on
experience
and
the
more
injuries,
the
more
loses,
the
more
the
employer
will
pay
for
his
contribution
to
the
social
security
or
to
workman’s
compensation.
now,
flemming
versus
nestor
which
was
decided
in
1960
upheld
the
refusal
of
social
security
benefits
to
a
deportee
and
then
went
on
to
say
that
this
is
not
to
say,
however,
the
congress
may
exercise
it's
power
to
modify
the
statutory
scheme,
free
of
all
constitutional
restrain.
the
interest
of
a
covered
employee
under
the
act
is
a
sufficient
substance
to
fall
within
protection
from
arbitrary,
government
action
afforded
by
due
process
clause.
of
course
mentioning
this
particular
case
of
nestor,
i
said
such
is
not
the
case
here,
the
fact
that
the
beneficiary
is
resident
abroad,
in
a
case
of
the
deportee,
a
presumably
permanent
residence
can
be
of
obvious
relevance
to
the
question
of
eligibility.
and
this
was
a
decision
in
nestor.
nestor
said
held
that
congress
could
not
arbitrarily
change
the
scheme
of
social
security.
in
a
same
particular
--
.
mr.
john
charles
harris
if
he
moves
abroad.
but
the
this
--
.
mr.
john
charles
harris
this
is
a
question
of
eligibility
as
to
when
he
was
eligible.
this
particular
--
the--
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
believe
the
court
based
the
decision
on
what
it
means
eligible.
mr.
john
charles
harris
this
is
true,
he
did
lose
his
benefits
but
the
court
didn't
rule
he
was
ineligible
in
this
particular
case
the
man
is
eligible.
in
1965,
when
he
has
under
the
act,
they
did
reduce
his
benefits.
but
in
this
particular
--
in
the
same
decision,
they
quoted
senator
george
when
this
original
social
security
act
was
put
into
being
and
he
says
it
comports
better
than
any
substitute
we
have
discovered
with
the
american
concept
that
free
men
want
to
earn
their
security
and
not
ask
for
dollars.
that
is
what
as
a
matter
of
right,
of
earned
right
is
far
better
than
the
gratuity.
social
security
is
not
a
hand
out,
it
is
not
a
charity,
it
is
not
really
--
it
is
an
earned
right
based
on
the
contributions
and
earnings
of
the
individual.
as
an
earned
right,
the
individual
is
eligible
to
receive
his
benefit,
and
dignity
and
self
respect.
now,
although
goldberg
versus
kelly
spelled
procedure
requirements,
the
decision
lasted
on
due
process
clause
of
the
constitution
and
in
doing
so
made
welfare
a
property
right
that
could
not
be
deprived
without
due
process
of
law.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
the
argument
from
the
appellant
is
that
we
must
go
back
and
get
our
due
process
of
law.
mr.
john
charles
harris
well,
as
the
constitution
would
say
a
property
right,
in
the
case
of
flemming,
it
was
liberty
without
due
process
of
law
and
flemming
went
to
the
united
states
or
to
the
supreme
court
of
virginia,
and
when
they
came
here,
they
were
not
looking
for
more
procedure,
they
are
looking
for
a
wedding
license.
in
this
court,
they
(voice
overlap)
wedding
license.
mr.
john
charles
harris
we
are
looking--
mr.
john
charles
harris
no,
we
are
not
looking
for
a
procedure.
i
believe,
procedure
is
gone,
we
are
attacking
or
we
are
asking
for
an
affirmation
of
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
which
says
that
this
particular
section
224
of
the
social
security
act
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
john
charles
harris
not
on
the
basis
of
due
process.
on
a
basis
that
this
was
a
property
right
protected
by
the
constitution.
mr.
john
charles
harris
goldberg
was
due
process,
but
i
was
pointing
(voice
overlap).
mr.
john
charles
harris
well,
i
mean
both.
mr.
john
charles
harris
a
due
process
is
that
sometimes
procedure
would
not
give
you
your
answer.
you
can
be
deprived,
you
can
carry
all
the
procedure
you
want.
mr.
john
charles
harris
you
mean,
as
far
as
you
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
believe
as
a
point
in
flemming
case,
that
they
had
exercised,
they
have
all
the
due
process
they
could
get.
all
we
have
to
do
is
court,
but
still
they
did
not
get
what
they
wanted.
mr.
john
charles
harris
no,
i
am
not
looking
for
marriage
license
but
i
am
saying
that
a
due
process
is
not
necessarily
a
procedure
or
a
hearing.
we
are
looking
for
protection
of
rights.
if
we
go
back
to
the
district
court
for
a
hearing
on
this,
as
to
whether
he
should
loose
his
property
right,
we
then
determine
whether
he
would
be
properly
rehabilitated
if
he
does
not
get
the
full
amount
of
his
workman’s
compensation.
or,
whether
we
can
assist
him
of
a
workman’s
compensation.
these
are
the
factors
of
the
government
relies
on
as
the
purpose
for
the
224
of
the
act.
that
it
would
--
if
this
is
not
in
there
or
weaken
the
workman’s
compensation
system
and
it
will
not
unable
the
worker
that
say
we
will
work
to
be
rehabilitated.
so,
we
are
looking
for
due
process
but
we
--
a
procedure
will
not
benefit
us.
we
want
to
protect
the
rights
that
are
protected
under
due
process
and
a
due
process
is
the
act
of
congress,
the
congress
is
taking
away
from
this
man,
something
which
he
has
earned.
and,
if
were
a
hearing
will
not
give
to
do
us
any
good,
what
we
need
is
an
overturn
of
the
statute
that
takes
his
property
away
from
him.
mr.
john
charles
harris
well,
it
is
very
definite.
mr.
john
charles
harris
actuarial
it's
very,
very
definitely
an
actual
situation.
mr.
john
charles
harris
it
is
a
consideration.
whether
it
is
sufficient
consideration
is
another
thing
--
there
is
some
other
things
that
could
be
considered.
mr.
john
charles
harris
but,
is
it
not
discriminatory,
if
they
pick
on
one
smaller
section,
does
not
the
trial
court
mentioned
the
fourteenth
amendment,
that
people
will
have
protection
of
the
law?
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
would
agree,
i
believe
we
can
take
the
point.
mr.
john
charles
harris
they
do,
the
--
if
a
man
is
injured
and
he
is
eligible
for
the
disability
provision
for
social
security.
mr.
john
charles
harris
there
are
other
benefits
which
this
man
can
receive
that
he
does
not
pay
for
it,
but
his
social
security
is
not
reduced.
for
instance,
the
eight
payments,
if
he
receives
any
pension
from
the
veterans
administration,
if
he
receives
a
court
settlement.
in
some
cases,
they
talked
about,
maybe,
it
would
suffer
from
the
lingering
if
he
did
not
receive
sufficient
amount
of
money,
but
if
he
receives
a
court
settlement
and
if
he
is
totally
disabled
and
he
receives
a
court
settlement,
he
could
receive
up
to
a
half
million
dollars
and
still
collect
that
his
disability
provisions
of
social
security.
he
can
get
welfare,
and
these
is
often
the
case,
that
he
gets
welfare
including
the
dependent
children,
which
he
does
not
pay
anything
for.
but
his
social
security
is
not
reduced.
now,
there
is
one
thing
that
is
very
interesting
here,
mr.
west,
my
associate
gave
me
a
letter.
this
was
sent
to
him
by
--
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare
and
it
reads,
give
mr.
west,
according
to
our
records--
mr.
john
charles
harris
no,
it
is
not.
this
is
just--
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
just,
it's
just
an
idea
of
fairness.
i
am
not--
mr.
john
charles
harris
all
right,
well,
anyway,
what
it
says
--
i
mean,
what
we
are
doing
in
this
particular
case
is
saying
that
the
benefits
are
reduced
because
of
the
workman’s
compensation
were
the
payment
to
the
wife
is
$70
a
month,
and
to
the
children
$5.10
a
month.
the
man’s
workman’s
compensation
benefits
were
$25.00
a
month
or
$25.00
a
week
and
he
is
on
welfare,
he
cannot
live
otherwise.
in
the
case
of
fruit
stands,
if
he
gets
fruit
stands,
his
benefits
are
not
reduced,
he
pays
nothing
for
this.
in
this
particular
case,
mr.
belcher
was
a
member
of
the
retirement
plan
for
the
united
mine
workers,
and
at
age
55
he
is
only
53.
at
age
55,
he
could
collect
the
pension,
but
still
his
benefits
with
his
social
security
will
not
be
reduced.
if
he
has
investment
income,
he
owns
property,
and
from
his
property,
he
is
getting
rental
income,
now,
this
in
some
way,
you
might
say
this
will
cost
him
money,
but
his
benefits
from
social
security
were
not
reduced
for
that,
if
the
relatives
give
him
gifts,
if
he
is
supported
by
others,
this
does
not
cost
him
anything
and
he
gets
that.
he
gets
the
no
reduction
in
his
social
security.
if
he
--
in
addition
under
the
act,
he
can
go
to
work
in
a
trial
basis
for
up
to
nine
months.
earn
as
much
as
he
pleases
and
the
money
he
makes
during
those
nine
months
does
not
reduce
his
social
security
disability.
also,
in
addition,
unless
his
income
is
some
substantial
gainful
employment
and
it
usually
fixes
at
$50.00
a
month.
during
a
time
he
is
getting
his
disability
then
his
payments
are
not
reduced
for
that
income
that
is
not
substantial
gain
from
employment.
now,
what
i
have
not
mentioned
here
is
a
private
insurance,
if
he
buys
private
insurance,
private
accident
health
insurance,
this
is
not
reduced
for
that.
also,
in
addition,
there
is
one
other
thing,
if
he
has
life
insurance
and
a
waiver
of
premium
on
it
when
he
is
disabled,
he
pays
no
more
premium
which
should
not
effect
his
dividend
to
him
from
the
company,
the
company
pays
his
premium
as
well.
so
this
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
right.
mr.
john
charles
harris
his
social
security
will
be
reduced.
now,
the
one
thing
that
is
misleading--
mr.
john
charles
harris
no,
it
would
not.
i
mean,
these
other
things
that
i
mention
here.
mr.
john
charles
harris
only
workman’s
compensation.
now,
there
is
one
thing
that
is
misleading,
the
formula
is
very
involved
as
to
determine
just
how
much
the
reduction
would
amount
to,
but
the
law
says
and
basically,
it
would
be
reduced
to
80%
of
his
earnings
but
not
less
than
zero.
now,
in
some
cases,
it
does
get
down
to
zero,
it
gets
down
close
to
zero.
in
the
case
here,
this
person
is
getting
--
it
is
reduced
down
to
a
$1.70
and
for
the
wife
and
$5.10
for
the
children.
so,
it
can
be
reduced
down
much
lower
than
the
80%.
mr.
john
charles
harris
now,
the
original
eliminate
the
entire
--
but
again,
so
this
was
repealed.
alright,
one
thing
one
further
thing
on
this
is
that
there
is
some
conversation
for
some
reason
given
here
as
that
maybe
rehabilitation
is
the
reason
for
this.
that
you
want
to
discourage
people
from
malingering
or
you
want
them
to
rehabilitate
and
become
productive
again.
this
is
only
paid
for
disability.
it
is
not
paid
for
anyone
who
for
his
total
disability.
anyone
who
is
not
totally
disabled
does
not
get
any
benefits
under
this
particular
section
of
the
act.
now,
to
establish
whether
you
are
disabled,
it
requires
that
you
must
be
--
there
must
be
a
medical
determinable,
physical
and
mental
impairment
that
can
result
in
death
or
which
has
last
it
or
can
be
expected
to
last
it
for
a
continuous
period
of
not
less
than
12
months.
so,
we
are
not
talking
about
someone
malingering.
now
again
to
the
act,
the
act
is
going
to
--
is
administered
to
the
extent
that
any
event
that
this
man
is
malingering,
they
can
--
and
imagine
under
goldberg
and
due
process
of
law,
give
him
a
hearing,
but
they
can
remove
his
benefits
from
it,
if
he
is
well.
again,
it
would
be
a
medical
determination,
so
as
far
as
workman’s
compensation,
it
could
be
malingering
because
it
is
not
--
it
is
a
temporary
basis.
in
this
particular
case
under
social
security,
it
must
be
a
serious
injury,
or--
mr.
john
charles
harris
yes,
it
could
go
on
for
more
than
that.
it
depends
often
you
get
a
permanent
award.
if
a
man
looses
a
leg
can
get,
during
the
time
that
--
until
such
time
he
gets
his
award,
he
gets
weekly
payments
and
after
that,
he
gets
an
award
of
maybe
200
weeks
for
the
lost
of
a
leg.
mr.
john
charles
harris
for
life,
it
could
go
on
for
life.
okay.
the
workman’s
compensation
is
paid
forward
by
the
employer
and
it
is
really
a
purchase
of
insurance,
and
if
you
want
to
consider
it
is
part
of
the
cost
of
labor
in
west
virginia,
the
court
--
the
highest
court
of
the
land
ruled
that
it
is
a
contract,
further
contract
between
the
employer
and
the
employee.
therefore,
it
is
part
--
in
west
virginia,
it
is
part
of
the
income
or
salary
of
the
employees,
so
in
fact
he
does
paid
for
it.
he
pays
for
the
cost
of
labor
he
does
pay
for
his
workman’s
compensation.
even
though
the
money
never
passes
through
him
but
passes
strictly
through
the
funds
from
the
employer.
and
again,
as
far
as
the
--
going
back
to
the
nestor
case,
we
are
saying
that
congress
can
not
be
arbitrary.
if
congress
had
a
specific
purpose
that
was
impartially
applied
to
all
people
who
would
be
disabled,
then
it
would
be
perfectly
--
i
would
be
perfectly
agreeable
that
this
is
a
good
law.
but
arbitrarily,
they
are
picking
on
the
individual
who
is
working
and
disable
as
suppose
to
the
individual
who
is
not
working
and
disabled.
now
i
have
my
own
opinion
as
to
where
this
particular
exclusion
came
into
the
--
how
this
particular
exclusion
came
into
the
act.
and
i
think
probably
in
1956,
that
someone
was
delegated
with
the
job
of
coming
up
with
an
accident
or
disability
provision
for
the
compensation
for
the
social
security
act.
and
looking
to
see
where
they
would
find
what
would
be
the
proper
terms
to
put
in
there,
they
picked
up
accident
and
health
insurance.
i
mean
in
every
accident
and
health
policy,
there
is
an
exclusion
for
workman’s
compensation.
mr.
john
charles
harris
well,
i
do
not
--
i
would
--
now
i
have
the
legislative
history.
the
act
was
passed
in
1956,
or
this
is
amendment
for
the
act.
the
only
thing
i
can
determine
is
why
would
they
exclude
only
workman’s
compensation?
mr.
john
charles
harris
okay.
well,
there
is
no
plausible
rationale
for
the
discrimination
between
this
worker
who
is
injured
as
a
result
of
unemployment
and
others
who
maybe
injured
otherwise,
and
therefore
can
not
or
not
excluded
or
not
reduced
or
offset
by
the
workman’s
compensation
benefit
payments.
mr.
john
charles
harris
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court,
the
district
court
interpreting
goldberg
versus
kelly
has
determined
the
welfare
was
a
property
right,
and
therefore
protected
by
due
property
clause,
however
to
distinguish
between
welfare
and
social
security
was
illogical,
and
grossly
inequitable,
and
further
they
held
that
section
224,
of
the
social
security
act
arbitrarily
discriminated
between
the
disabled
worker
and
other
disabled
persons.
therefore
violating
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
and
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
addition
to
this,
the
district
court
also
stated
that
the
workman’s
compensation
law
and
the
state
of
west
virginia
is
very
unique
in
so
far
as
this
is
a
voluntary
law
where
the
employer
and
the
employee
voluntarily
go
into
this
particular
act
and
go
into
the
act,
and
therefore
as
such,
the
highest
court
in
the
state
of
west
virginia
has
held
that
this
is
an
integral
part
of
the
contract
between
the
employer
and
employee
and
the
act
of
receiving
benefits
or
not
receiving
benefits
under
the
social
security
act
and
in
this
particular
case,
mr.
belcher
his
payments
were
reduced
in
violation
of
his
contract
with
his
employer
as
covered
under
the
compensation
act
of
the
state
of
west
virginia.
mr.
john
charles
harris
now,
once
the
election
is
made,
he
looses
his
right
to
sue.
he
looses
his
(voice
overlap).
mr.
john
charles
harris
when
he
goes
--
actually,
in
most
cases
--
here
in
this
particular
case
there
was
a
union
election.
but
otherwise,
i
presumed
the
burden
is
on
the
employer
to
accept
the
workman’s
compensation
law
and
then
posting
a
notice
to
the
employees
and
that
i
am
under
the
law,
and
therefore
if
you
work
for
me
you
are
waiving
your
common
law
right.
mr.
john
charles
harris
it
is
a
state
fund.
but
the
contributions
come
from
the
employers.
it
is
not
public
funds.
it
is
the
administered
as
a
trust
fund
with
the
money
coming
from
the
employers.
mr.
john
charles
harris
no
state
cost.
mr.
john
charles
harris
no,
it
is
a
fund
administered
by
the
funds
that
are
received
from
the
employer
and
each
employer
pays
a
premium
if
you
want
to
call
it
that,on
the
payroll
that
he
pays
to
his
employees.
very
similar
to
the
other
states
that
they
have
an
insurance
policy,
their
rate
is
applied
to
the
amount
of
payroll
and
they
pay
the
--
and
that's
the
basis
of
their
insurance,
payment
to
the
insurance
company.
mr.
john
charles
harris
yes,
it
does.
it
does
differentiate
between
a
private
insurance
for
which
he
would
pay
the
premium.
but
it
does
not
differentiate
from
other
states
where
the
employer
pays
the
premium
on
the
workman’s
compensation
insurance.
in
other
states
in
--
there
are
only
six
states
that
have
state
funds.
the
other
44
states
do
have
insurance.
for
insurance,
the
employer
buys
insurance,
pays
forth
fully
and
this
covers
the
employee
in
the
event
of
industrial
accident.
the
appellant
contends
that
the
goldberg
which
is
the
basis
of
the
decision
in
a
district
court
strictly
applied
to
a
procedure
requirement
and
further
it
contended
the
discrimination
was
justified
--
justifying
the
discrimination
against
disabled
workers
as
compared
to
other
disabled
people.
so
this
was
justified,
so
otherwise
it
would
not
weaken
workman’s
compensation
laws.
and
quite
to
contrary
it
is
true,
as
pointed
out
by
mr.
chief
justice
here,
that
the
states
are
and
will
in
the
future
reduce
their
workman’s
compensation
benefits
and
therefore
weaken
the
law
to
enable
less
money
from
them
and
more
money
from
the
federal
government
in
the
form
of
the
social
security
laws.
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
would
say
that
the
state
is
subject
to
the
same
pressures
from
employers,
from
the
organizations,
i
am
noticing
in
the
brief
here,
most
of
the
opposition
to
the
repeal
of
this
section
224
came
from
the
national
association
of
manufacturers.
it
came
from
that
the
chamber
of
commerce
and
i
think,
the
same
thing
could
apply
in
a
particular
state
where
a
national
association
manufacturer’s,
chambers
of
commerce
other
employers
could
pressure
the
legislators
to
reduce
the
amount
of
payment
for
disability
on
the
social
security
and
in
fact
save
them
the
expense.
since
the
rates
are
based
on
experience
and
the
more
injuries,
the
more
loses,
the
more
the
employer
will
pay
for
his
contribution
to
the
social
security
or
to
workman’s
compensation.
now,
flemming
versus
nestor
which
was
decided
in
1960
upheld
the
refusal
of
social
security
benefits
to
a
deportee
and
then
went
on
to
say
that
this
is
not
to
say,
however,
the
congress
may
exercise
it's
power
to
modify
the
statutory
scheme,
free
of
all
constitutional
restrain.
the
interest
of
a
covered
employee
under
the
act
is
a
sufficient
substance
to
fall
within
protection
from
arbitrary,
government
action
afforded
by
due
process
clause.
of
course
mentioning
this
particular
case
of
nestor,
i
said
such
is
not
the
case
here,
the
fact
that
the
beneficiary
is
resident
abroad,
in
a
case
of
the
deportee,
a
presumably
permanent
residence
can
be
of
obvious
relevance
to
the
question
of
eligibility.
and
this
was
a
decision
in
nestor.
nestor
said
held
that
congress
could
not
arbitrarily
change
the
scheme
of
social
security.
in
a
same
particular
--
.
mr.
john
charles
harris
if
he
moves
abroad.
but
the
this
--
.
mr.
john
charles
harris
this
is
a
question
of
eligibility
as
to
when
he
was
eligible.
this
particular
--
the--
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
believe
the
court
based
the
decision
on
what
it
means
eligible.
mr.
john
charles
harris
this
is
true,
he
did
lose
his
benefits
but
the
court
didn't
rule
he
was
ineligible
in
this
particular
case
the
man
is
eligible.
in
1965,
when
he
has
under
the
act,
they
did
reduce
his
benefits.
but
in
this
particular
--
in
the
same
decision,
they
quoted
senator
george
when
this
original
social
security
act
was
put
into
being
and
he
says
it
comports
better
than
any
substitute
we
have
discovered
with
the
american
concept
that
free
men
want
to
earn
their
security
and
not
ask
for
dollars.
that
is
what
as
a
matter
of
right,
of
earned
right
is
far
better
than
the
gratuity.
social
security
is
not
a
hand
out,
it
is
not
a
charity,
it
is
not
really
--
it
is
an
earned
right
based
on
the
contributions
and
earnings
of
the
individual.
as
an
earned
right,
the
individual
is
eligible
to
receive
his
benefit,
and
dignity
and
self
respect.
now,
although
goldberg
versus
kelly
spelled
procedure
requirements,
the
decision
lasted
on
due
process
clause
of
the
constitution
and
in
doing
so
made
welfare
a
property
right
that
could
not
be
deprived
without
due
process
of
law.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
the
argument
from
the
appellant
is
that
we
must
go
back
and
get
our
due
process
of
law.
mr.
john
charles
harris
well,
as
the
constitution
would
say
a
property
right,
in
the
case
of
flemming,
it
was
liberty
without
due
process
of
law
and
flemming
went
to
the
united
states
or
to
the
supreme
court
of
virginia,
and
when
they
came
here,
they
were
not
looking
for
more
procedure,
they
are
looking
for
a
wedding
license.
in
this
court,
they
(voice
overlap)
wedding
license.
mr.
john
charles
harris
we
are
looking--
mr.
john
charles
harris
no,
we
are
not
looking
for
a
procedure.
i
believe,
procedure
is
gone,
we
are
attacking
or
we
are
asking
for
an
affirmation
of
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
which
says
that
this
particular
section
224
of
the
social
security
act
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
john
charles
harris
not
on
the
basis
of
due
process.
on
a
basis
that
this
was
a
property
right
protected
by
the
constitution.
mr.
john
charles
harris
goldberg
was
due
process,
but
i
was
pointing
(voice
overlap).
mr.
john
charles
harris
well,
i
mean
both.
mr.
john
charles
harris
a
due
process
is
that
sometimes
procedure
would
not
give
you
your
answer.
you
can
be
deprived,
you
can
carry
all
the
procedure
you
want.
mr.
john
charles
harris
you
mean,
as
far
as
you
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
believe
as
a
point
in
flemming
case,
that
they
had
exercised,
they
have
all
the
due
process
they
could
get.
all
we
have
to
do
is
court,
but
still
they
did
not
get
what
they
wanted.
mr.
john
charles
harris
no,
i
am
not
looking
for
marriage
license
but
i
am
saying
that
a
due
process
is
not
necessarily
a
procedure
or
a
hearing.
we
are
looking
for
protection
of
rights.
if
we
go
back
to
the
district
court
for
a
hearing
on
this,
as
to
whether
he
should
loose
his
property
right,
we
then
determine
whether
he
would
be
properly
rehabilitated
if
he
does
not
get
the
full
amount
of
his
workman’s
compensation.
or,
whether
we
can
assist
him
of
a
workman’s
compensation.
these
are
the
factors
of
the
government
relies
on
as
the
purpose
for
the
224
of
the
act.
that
it
would
--
if
this
is
not
in
there
or
weaken
the
workman’s
compensation
system
and
it
will
not
unable
the
worker
that
say
we
will
work
to
be
rehabilitated.
so,
we
are
looking
for
due
process
but
we
--
a
procedure
will
not
benefit
us.
we
want
to
protect
the
rights
that
are
protected
under
due
process
and
a
due
process
is
the
act
of
congress,
the
congress
is
taking
away
from
this
man,
something
which
he
has
earned.
and,
if
were
a
hearing
will
not
give
to
do
us
any
good,
what
we
need
is
an
overturn
of
the
statute
that
takes
his
property
away
from
him.
mr.
john
charles
harris
well,
it
is
very
definite.
mr.
john
charles
harris
actuarial
it's
very,
very
definitely
an
actual
situation.
mr.
john
charles
harris
it
is
a
consideration.
whether
it
is
sufficient
consideration
is
another
thing
--
there
is
some
other
things
that
could
be
considered.
mr.
john
charles
harris
but,
is
it
not
discriminatory,
if
they
pick
on
one
smaller
section,
does
not
the
trial
court
mentioned
the
fourteenth
amendment,
that
people
will
have
protection
of
the
law?
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
would
agree,
i
believe
we
can
take
the
point.
mr.
john
charles
harris
they
do,
the
--
if
a
man
is
injured
and
he
is
eligible
for
the
disability
provision
for
social
security.
mr.
john
charles
harris
there
are
other
benefits
which
this
man
can
receive
that
he
does
not
pay
for
it,
but
his
social
security
is
not
reduced.
for
instance,
the
eight
payments,
if
he
receives
any
pension
from
the
veterans
administration,
if
he
receives
a
court
settlement.
in
some
cases,
they
talked
about,
maybe,
it
would
suffer
from
the
lingering
if
he
did
not
receive
sufficient
amount
of
money,
but
if
he
receives
a
court
settlement
and
if
he
is
totally
disabled
and
he
receives
a
court
settlement,
he
could
receive
up
to
a
half
million
dollars
and
still
collect
that
his
disability
provisions
of
social
security.
he
can
get
welfare,
and
these
is
often
the
case,
that
he
gets
welfare
including
the
dependent
children,
which
he
does
not
pay
anything
for.
but
his
social
security
is
not
reduced.
now,
there
is
one
thing
that
is
very
interesting
here,
mr.
west,
my
associate
gave
me
a
letter.
this
was
sent
to
him
by
--
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare
and
it
reads,
give
mr.
west,
according
to
our
records--
mr.
john
charles
harris
no,
it
is
not.
this
is
just--
mr.
john
charles
harris
i
just,
it's
just
an
idea
of
fairness.
i
am
not--
mr.
john
charles
harris
all
right,
well,
anyway,
what
it
says
--
i
mean,
what
we
are
doing
in
this
particular
case
is
saying
that
the
benefits
are
reduced
because
of
the
workman’s
compensation
were
the
payment
to
the
wife
is
$70
a
month,
and
to
the
children
$5.10
a
month.
the
man’s
workman’s
compensation
benefits
were
$25.00
a
month
or
$25.00
a
week
and
he
is
on
welfare,
he
cannot
live
otherwise.
in
the
case
of
fruit
stands,
if
he
gets
fruit
stands,
his
benefits
are
not
reduced,
he
pays
nothing
for
this.
in
this
particular
case,
mr.
belcher
was
a
member
of
the
retirement
plan
for
the
united
mine
workers,
and
at
age
55
he
is
only
53.
at
age
55,
he
could
collect
the
pension,
but
still
his
benefits
with
his
social
security
will
not
be
reduced.
if
he
has
investment
income,
he
owns
property,
and
from
his
property,
he
is
getting
rental
income,
now,
this
in
some
way,
you
might
say
this
will
cost
him
money,
but
his
benefits
from
social
security
were
not
reduced
for
that,
if
the
relatives
give
him
gifts,
if
he
is
supported
by
others,
this
does
not
cost
him
anything
and
he
gets
that.
he
gets
the
no
reduction
in
his
social
security.
if
he
--
in
addition
under
the
act,
he
can
go
to
work
in
a
trial
basis
for
up
to
nine
months.
earn
as
much
as
he
pleases
and
the
money
he
makes
during
those
nine
months
does
not
reduce
his
social
security
disability.
also,
in
addition,
unless
his
income
is
some
substantial
gainful
employment
and
it
usually
fixes
at
$50.00
a
month.
during
a
time
he
is
getting
his
disability
then
his
payments
are
not
reduced
for
that
income
that
is
not
substantial
gain
from
employment.
now,
what
i
have
not
mentioned
here
is
a
private
insurance,
if
he
buys
private
insurance,
private
accident
health
insurance,
this
is
not
reduced
for
that.
also,
in
addition,
there
is
one
other
thing,
if
he
has
life
insurance
and
a
waiver
of
premium
on
it
when
he
is
disabled,
he
pays
no
more
premium
which
should
not
effect
his
dividend
to
him
from
the
company,
the
company
pays
his
premium
as
well.
so
this
--
mr.
john
charles
harris
right.
mr.
john
charles
harris
his
social
security
will
be
reduced.
now,
the
one
thing
that
is
misleading--
mr.
john
charles
harris
no,
it
would
not.
i
mean,
these
other
things
that
i
mention
here.
mr.
john
charles
harris
only
workman’s
compensation.
now,
there
is
one
thing
that
is
misleading,
the
formula
is
very
involved
as
to
determine
just
how
much
the
reduction
would
amount
to,
but
the
law
says
and
basically,
it
would
be
reduced
to
80%
of
his
earnings
but
not
less
than
zero.
now,
in
some
cases,
it
does
get
down
to
zero,
it
gets
down
close
to
zero.
in
the
case
here,
this
person
is
getting
--
it
is
reduced
down
to
a
$1.70
and
for
the
wife
and
$5.10
for
the
children.
so,
it
can
be
reduced
down
much
lower
than
the
80%.
mr.
john
charles
harris
now,
the
original
eliminate
the
entire
--
but
again,
so
this
was
repealed.
alright,
one
thing
one
further
thing
on
this
is
that
there
is
some
conversation
for
some
reason
given
here
as
that
maybe
rehabilitation
is
the
reason
for
this.
that
you
want
to
discourage
people
from
malingering
or
you
want
them
to
rehabilitate
and
become
productive
again.
this
is
only
paid
for
disability.
it
is
not
paid
for
anyone
who
for
his
total
disability.
anyone
who
is
not
totally
disabled
does
not
get
any
benefits
under
this
particular
section
of
the
act.
now,
to
establish
whether
you
are
disabled,
it
requires
that
you
must
be
--
there
must
be
a
medical
determinable,
physical
and
mental
impairment
that
can
result
in
death
or
which
has
last
it
or
can
be
expected
to
last
it
for
a
continuous
period
of
not
less
than
12
months.
so,
we
are
not
talking
about
someone
malingering.
now
again
to
the
act,
the
act
is
going
to
--
is
administered
to
the
extent
that
any
event
that
this
man
is
malingering,
they
can
--
and
imagine
under
goldberg
and
due
process
of
law,
give
him
a
hearing,
but
they
can
remove
his
benefits
from
it,
if
he
is
well.
again,
it
would
be
a
medical
determination,
so
as
far
as
workman’s
compensation,
it
could
be
malingering
because
it
is
not
--
it
is
a
temporary
basis.
in
this
particular
case
under
social
security,
it
must
be
a
serious
injury,
or--
mr.
john
charles
harris
yes,
it
could
go
on
for
more
than
that.
it
depends
often
you
get
a
permanent
award.
if
a
man
looses
a
leg
can
get,
during
the
time
that
--
until
such
time
he
gets
his
award,
he
gets
weekly
payments
and
after
that,
he
gets
an
award
of
maybe
200
weeks
for
the
lost
of
a
leg.
mr.
john
charles
harris
for
life,
it
could
go
on
for
life.
okay.
the
workman’s
compensation
is
paid
forward
by
the
employer
and
it
is
really
a
purchase
of
insurance,
and
if
you
want
to
consider
it
is
part
of
the
cost
of
labor
in
west
virginia,
the
court
--
the
highest
court
of
the
land
ruled
that
it
is
a
contract,
further
contract
between
the
employer
and
the
employee.
therefore,
it
is
part
--
in
west
virginia,
it
is
part
of
the
income
or
salary
of
the
employees,
so
in
fact
he
does
paid
for
it.
he
pays
for
the
cost
of
labor
he
does
pay
for
his
workman’s
compensation.
even
though
the
money
never
passes
through
him
but
passes
strictly
through
the
funds
from
the
employer.
and
again,
as
far
as
the
--
going
back
to
the
nestor
case,
we
are
saying
that
congress
can
not
be
arbitrary.
if
congress
had
a
specific
purpose
that
was
impartially
applied
to
all
people
who
would
be
disabled,
then
it
would
be
perfectly
--
i
would
be
perfectly
agreeable
that
this
is
a
good
law.
but
arbitrarily,
they
are
picking
on
the
individual
who
is
working
and
disable
as
suppose
to
the
individual
who
is
not
working
and
disabled.
now
i
have
my
own
opinion
as
to
where
this
particular
exclusion
came
into
the
--
how
this
particular
exclusion
came
into
the
act.
and
i
think
probably
in
1956,
that
someone
was
delegated
with
the
job
of
coming
up
with
an
accident
or
disability
provision
for
the
compensation
for
the
social
security
act.
and
looking
to
see
where
they
would
find
what
would
be
the
proper
terms
to
put
in
there,
they
picked
up
accident
and
health
insurance.
i
mean
in
every
accident
and
health
policy,
there
is
an
exclusion
for
workman’s
compensation.
mr.
john
charles
harris
well,
i
do
not
--
i
would
--
now
i
have
the
legislative
history.
the
act
was
passed
in
1956,
or
this
is
amendment
for
the
act.
the
only
thing
i
can
determine
is
why
would
they
exclude
only
workman’s
compensation?
mr.
john
charles
harris
okay.
well,
there
is
no
plausible
rationale
for
the
discrimination
between
this
worker
who
is
injured
as
a
result
of
unemployment
and
others
who
maybe
injured
otherwise,
and
therefore
can
not
or
not
excluded
or
not
reduced
or
offset
by
the
workman’s
compensation
benefit
payments.
