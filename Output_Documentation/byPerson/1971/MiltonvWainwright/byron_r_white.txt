mr.

did
you
call
our
attention
to
any
cases
here
in
this
court
where
admitting
an
inadmissible
confession
had
been
held
to
be
a
harmless
error?
justice
byron

white
no,
what
chapman
--
do
you
think
either
one
of
them
held
that
an
involuntary
confession
could
be
admitted
then
be
held
to
be
harmless
error?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
your
proposition
is
that
even
if
it
were,
these
confessions
were
inadmissible,
it
was
harmless
error,
do
you
admit
them?
justice
byron

if
is
just
a
confession
that
is
taken
without
the
presence
of
counsel?
justice
byron

so,
if
massiah
is
retroactive,
you
nevertheless
would
say
that
the
confession
taken
in
violation
of
the
massiah
could
be
admitted
if
it
were
--
justice
byron

if
admitted,
it
could
be
