mr.
j.
robert
olian
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset
for
the
sake
of
clarification,
i
think
that
we
ought
to
talk
about
the
confessions,
that
were
involved.
in
fact,
i
think
if
you
--
the
best
way
to
look
at
this
confessions
is
one
the
major
confession
that
is
being
talked
about
in
the
petition
of
certiorari
which
was
the
confession
which
was
elicited
by
officer
langford
in
the
cell
of
the
petitioner.
secondly,
there
is
one
other
confession
which
also
was
discussed
by
the
courts
at
the
state
level
which
is
referred
to
in
the
petitioner’s
brief
as
405
confession.
in
fact
what
it
is
one
confession
that
was
taped,
that
was
transcribed,
that
was
changed,
that
was
initial,
but
essentially
we
have
two
and
the
second
one
i
refer
to
is
that
confession
which
was
made
to
officers
holmes
and
mcclure.
now,
there
is
in
fact
in
the
record
and
i
think
you
will
find
it
in
our
brief
one
statement
which
might
in
fact
be
considered
the
third
confession
and
that
statement
has
never
been
challenged
at
any
level
and
that
is
from
the
record
on
page
148
when
officer
mcgraw
arrived
at
the
scene
of
the
crime,
he
was
asked,
when
you
saw
this
defendant
lying
on
the
pavement,
describe
if
you
will
what
he
was
doing,
what
he
was
saying
if
anything?
he
replied,
well,
he
kept
insisting
he
drove
his
car
into
the
river.
now,
in
terms
of
argument,
this
is
quite
important
so
again
there
is
the
langford,
holmes,
and
mcclure
and
this
other
confession
of
officer
mcclure
and
i
think
that
these
distinctions
have
to
be
kept
in
mind.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
mr.
justice,
there
is
no
question
except
the
meaning
of
what
he
said.
that
is
why
i
am
saying
that
there
is
some,
you
could
call
that
a
third
confession,
whether
he
drove
it
or
not.
the
state’s
contention
–-
mr.
j.
robert
olian
mr.
justice,
the
state’s
contention
at
the
trial
was
he
did
not
drive
the
car
in
the
river.
he
jumped
out
of
the
car
before
it
went
into
the
river,
so
i
think
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
well,
in
this
case,
he
is
saying
in
effect
that
he
did
drive
it
into
river
whereas
at
the
trial
i
think
it
goes
more
of
the
question
of
credibility.
at
the
trial
what
he
said
was
he
blank
out;
he
does
not
remember
what
happened,
as
far
as
his
story
of
what
happened.
here
he
says,
yes
i
did
drive
into
the
river.
again,
i
think
this
is
equivocal,
but
i
think
it
raises
some
question
about
credibility
of
his
own
story
of
what
took
place
and
i
think
that
is
important
in
terms
of
the
facts
that
were
presented
at
this
trial
because
there
are
constant
discrepancies
in
terms
of
the
stories
that
were
told
and
i
think
there
are
constant
considerations
here
of
credibility.
i
would
like
to
talk
about
those
considerations
somewhat
further.
again,
that
is
equivocal
as
a
confession,
but
it
does
disagree
with
the
story
that
he
told
he
blanked
out
that
he
does
not
remember
what
happened.
so
how
does
this
is
interpreted
is
not
totally
clear.
and
far
as
the
facts
in
this
case
go,
there
are
number
of
things,
it
was
stated
by
the
petitioner
and
he
was
questioned
almost
daily.
a
couple
of
these
questioning
periods
had
to
do
with
cases
which
were
another
jurisdictions
that
are
asked
when
you
hold
him
for
investigation?
they
came
down,
they
did
interrogate
him.
the
longest
questioning
period
was
one
where
the
--
it
was
either
polk,
florida
or
mississippi,
i
feel
which
one
of
the
two
came
down
questioning
for
six
hours
about
another
alleged
crime.
now,
they
asked
him
at
the
state
hearing
and
this
quite
important
and
it
is
in
our
brief,
they
said
to
him,
you
were
not
questioned
between
the
4th
and
11th?
now
you
notice,
they
are
saying
constant
questioning,
long
questioning,
great
deal
of
psychological
coercion
and
pressure
and
this
kind
of
thing.
the
petitioner
was
asked,
you
were
not
questioned
between
the
4th
and
the
11th?
he
answered,
i
could
have
been.
the
court:
not
could
have
been,
were
you
or
were
you
not.
you
were
there,
you
know
about
it.
you
are
the
only
one
that
can
tell
us
and
it
is
in
the
petitioner
from
the
4th
day
to
the
11th,
i
believe
that
i
was
questioned,
i
mean,
i
was
trying
to
think.
i
believe,
i
was
questioned
sometimes
during
the
time
from
the
4th
to
the
11th
and
on
it
goes,
he
can
identify
three
periods
your
honor,
the
longest
period
being
roughly
one-and-a-half
hours
during
this
time
that
he
was
held
for
questioning.
so
this
matter
of
constant
questioning
in
terms
of
all
the
confessions,
now
this
goes
to
the
holmes
and
mcclure
confession
which
is
not
the
one
which
is
a
primary
basis
for
the
petition
here.
he
says
--
the
petitioner
claims
well,
he
was
asked
to
write
to
his
wife’s
family.
this
has
to
be
clarified.
he
apparently
has
another
wife.
minnie
is
not
his
real
wife
as
far
we
can
tell
and
he
would
said
no,
i
could
not,
i
could
not,
i
was
not
even
allowed
to
write
to
her.
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
appendix,
you
will
find
three
pages
later
where
he
say,
yes,
i
did
write
her.
he
said
i
was
not
even
given
stationery,
three
pages
later,
he
said
yes,
i
did
write
to
her.
now,
another
point
as
far
as
facts
goes,
the
petitioner
points
out
this
is
a
common
type
of
policy.
i
think
it
is
also
worth
pointing
out
that
in
the
record,
john
tyler
took
the
stand.
he
said,
i
was
asked
by
the
petitioner
where
i
could
get
in
his
own
words
a
good
insurance.
i
think
it
is
also
very
important
to
know
that
the
petitioner
was
unable
to
sustain
and
so
very
effectively,
in
fact
one
witness
took
the
stand,
told
him
how
he
hacked
the
suit
for
$2.00
because
he
was
short
of
cash
yet
he
managed
to
keep
up
the
payments
on
these
insurance
policies.
now,
with
that
in
mind,
i
would
like
to
get
to
the
issues
in
terms
of
the
structure
of
our
brief.
first
of
all
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
and
rely
for
the
langford
confession,
if
there
is
any
error
at
all
which
we
deny
and
i
like
to
get
to
this
in
more
details
in
a
moment,
but
if
there
is
any
error
at
all
it
is
clearly
harmless
error.
first,
we
still
have
the
holmes
and
mcclure
confession.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
that
is
correct
your
honor.
that
was
never
brought
up
to
that
court
and
i
think
that
as
we
pointed
in
our
brief
that
the
cases
by
this
court
have
said
if
you
do
not
raise
that
in
your
petition
that
perhaps
should
not
be
considered
by
this
court.
but
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
no,
i
am
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
right.
no,
i
was
talking
about
from
the
petitioner's
side.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
no,
i
was
not
referring
to
that
point,
your
honor.
he
was
not
bringing
up
this
other
confession.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
yes.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
yes.
as
far
as
the
evidence
was
involved,
we
have
the
confession.
we
have
the
evidence.
part
of
the
evidence
goes
in
this
case
there
is
--
that
was
overwhelming
proof
of
guilt.
i
will
just
go
through
some
of
these
facts
very
quickly
because
they
are
not
all
in
the
appendix.
it
is
a
very
long
record,
but
we
did
cite
these
facts
in
our
brief.
first
of
all,
his
car
was
purchased
nine
hours
before
this
accident
took
place.
i
told
you
about
the
insurance.
much
of
this
insurance
will
only
pay
in
case
of
accident.
it
will
not
pay
in
case
of
natural
death.
there
is
a
lot
of
testimony
about
his
relationship
toward
the
deceased,
minnie
claybon
that
he
does
not
particularly
care
for
her
that
he
has
written
to
others
how
he
was
coming
to
a
great
deal
of
money
which
would
further
his
boxing
career.
if
you
look
at
the
record
on
page
150
to
152,
it
tells
us
some
important
things
about
the
scene
of
the
accident.
it
was
well
lit.
there
was
good
weather.
utmost,
there
was
one
space
with
estimates
ranging
from
15
to
25
feet
of
opening.
the
rest
was
a
solid
line
of
both,
so
that
if
someone
lost
control
of
the
car,
the
odds
i
am
getting
in
that
particular
15
to
20
foot
opening
certainly
were
not
very
great
and
your
honors
this
is
particularly
important
in
this
trial.
the
back
windows
in
this
car
were
closed.
the
deceased
was
sitting
on
the
back
seat.
the
back
doors
could
not
be
opened.
they
were
latched
closed.
now,
the
previous
owner
of
the
car
was
asked
about
the
car
and
what
he
testified
to
was
this.
those
ornaments
had
never
kept
the
back
doors
closed,
that
the
doors
freely
opened.
that
at
the
time
of
the
accident,
the
police
officers
pointed
out
that
when
they
removed
the
car
from
the
miami
river,
they
had
to
use
tools
to
get
those
doors
open.
at
that
trial,
they
pointed
out
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
scratches
or
anything
else
on
these
chrome
ornaments
which
indicated
that
they
were
forced
closed
by
the
collision,
by
going
into
the
water
at
that
time.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
is
also
true
when
you
coprolite
with
the
confession
to
holmes
and
mcclure
which
was
at
no
point
in
the
federal
courts
raised
in
or
on
that
particular
regard.
now,
i
think
that
confession
is
particularly
important
and
i
think
two
things
ought
to
be
noticed,
not
only
about
that
confession
which
i
think
adds
to
the
harmless
error
argument
but
the
confession
to
langford.
i
think
when
you
examine
this
trial
transcript,
you
find
a
tremendous
concern
of
the
trial
judge
for
a
fair
trial.
a
meticulous
examination
of
all
the
parties
involved,
he
used
that
procedure
which
was
proscribed
by
this
court
in
jackson
v.
doe.
they
went
into
all
the
details
and
great
detail
and
decided
that
it
was
admissible.
it
was
not
until
then
that
it
was
turned
over
to
the
jury.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
your
honor
the
holmes
and
mcclure
was
put
in
and
put
in
detail
and
the
langford
testimony
was
put
in
and
put
in
detail.
although,
the
petitioner
suggested
that
the
langford
was
the
most
important,
i
think
if
you
examine
the
transcript,
examine
the
length
of
the
trial
you
discover
that
very
clearly
both
of
these
confessions
were
put
into
evidence
with
great
force.
so
the
holmes
and
mcclure
confession
is
just
important.
your
honors,
i
think
that
if
you
also
examine
in
relation
to
the
holmes
and
mcclure
confession
and
the
other
confession,
the
instructions
of
the
judge
to
the
jury,
you
find
again
evidence
of
this
very
meticulous
concern
that
he
cautioned
him
that
as
to
the
reconsidering
whether
or
not
the
confessions
were
voluntary
and
he
told
them,
they
could
disregard
them
entirely
if
they
so
desired.
i
think
that
what
also
was
important
as
some
of
the
evidence
of
other
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
specifically
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
your
honor,
i
think
he
did
not
separate
the
two
confessions
as
he
talked
about
confessions
and
their
voluntariness.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
well,
i
do
not
think
that
--
yes
inherently
he
would
think
so.
they
examined
this
thoroughly
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury
and
they
submitted
to
the
jury
with
these
cautionary
instructions,
i
do
not
think
it
is
a
layman
thing
it
seems.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
mr.
justice
i
had
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
mr.
justice
i
have
no
idea.
this
trial
took
place
in
1958
and
i
think
the
total
atmosphere
at
that
time
was
quite
different.
what
they
did,
i
think
what
their
motives
were
impossible
to
decide
at
this
time.
i
think
as
a
matter
of
law
however,
i
do
feel
that
these
factors
were
effectively
handled
at
trial
and
that
is
the
point
that
i
am
trying
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
your
honor,
i
cited
harrington
and
chapman
and
i
think
that
they
talked
about
the
proposition
here
that
(voice
overlap).
mr.
j.
robert
olian
your
honor,
first
of
all
i
am
not
saying
it
is
involuntary.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
your
honor,
i
would
make
a
distinction.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
well,
i
would
make
a
distinction
it
seems
to
me
in
terms
of
the
case
law
between
a
coerced
confession
and
a
confession
which
violates
his
right.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
and
i
think
it
has
to
be
one
or
the
other.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
in
the
sense
of
the
coercion?
mr.
j.
robert
olian
then
i
would
not
be
arguing
harmless
error
in
that
kind.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
yes,
i
think
harmless
error
applies
in
that
context.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
well,
that
is
not
the
issue
which
i
have
gotten
to.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
yes
mr.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
well
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
your
honor,
i
said
that
in
our
brief
we
say
that
harrington
and
chapman
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
well,
it
is
not
exactly
the
same,
but
we
do
have
confessions
which
were
inadmissible.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
any
mir
--
no,
i
am
sorry
your
honor.
i
did
not
cite
any.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
of
hand,
i
do
not
know.
i
am
sorry.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
your
honor,
my
reading
of
the
case
which
suggested
to
me
that
way
we
only
found
that
a
confession
was
coerced
in
the
sense
of
psychological
and
physical
and
a
like,
that
is
true.
i
do
not
feel
that
in
terms
of
a
massiah
type
situation
that
that
rule
should
be
applied.
i
do
not
think
it
is
the
same
kind
of
thing.
i
think
what
we
are
talking
about
is
a
situation
and
again,
i
am
not
granting
that
massiah
governs
this.
i
am
not
granting
that
massiah
should
be
granted
retroactively,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
abridgment
of
that
sixth
amendment
right
under
those
circumstances
should
not
automatically
result
in
a
reversal.
i
think
in
that
context,
yes,
the
harmless
error
doctrine
in
that
context
should
apply.
that
is
how
i
read
the
case
that
the
petitioner
is
primarily
relying
upon
how
i
read
the
case
of
this
court
and
that
is
what
i
am
urging.
i
think
perhaps,
i
ought
to
turn
to
the
question
of
massiah
in
retroactivity.
i
suggest
in
my
brief
and
i
would
get
to
this
quickly
as
far
as
the
facts
go
that
i
do
not
feel
it
is
desirable
to
extend
massiah
and
i
think
that
particularly
we
pointed
out
that
in
this
case,
what
you
have
is
the
situation
where
every
prisoner
volunteered
his
information
to
a
total
stranger,
i
think
it
is
a
distinction
worth
considering
because
i
think
if
massiah
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
i
might
have
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
yes,
i
do.
i
do.
i
think
if
you
will
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
mr.
justice,
we
are
talking
about
the
statements
to
officer
langford
now
who
is
put
in
the
cell.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
and
in
that
case,
i
think
if
you
look
at
what
the
petitioner
said
at
the
trial
he
said,
he
did
no
not
even
talk
to
the
man.
now
later
in
his
petition,
now
he
turns
around
and
says,
oh!
yes,
he
elicited
a
confession
from
me
but
at
the
trial
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
it
was
a
matter
of
hours.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
oh!
it
was
more
than
a
day,
yes,
but
it
was
something
like
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
well,
what
i
am
saying
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
mr.
justice,
what
i
mean
in
this
situation
is
that
what
happened
in
that
cell
did
not
amend
what
the
first
coerced
confession.
what
did
he
do?
he
asked
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
mr.
justice,
there
are
cases
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
mr.
justice,
there
are
cases
that
this
court
has
ruled
down
which
come
close
to
the
fact
what
you
are
talking
about
which
this
court
has
said
are
coercion.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
yes,
mr.
justice
i
think
there
are
a
lot
of
differences.
i
think
what
has
happened
here
is
that
is
he
in
the
cell
and
he
has
asking
some
questions.
he
made
some
absurd
accusations.
he
said
what
kind
of
psychological
inducement
was
there?
well,
he
shared
his
oatmeal
in
the
morning.
he
let
him
steal
some
candy
bars
and
a
few
times
he
said,
boy,
i
acted
crazy!
now,
i
do
not
think
that
that
is
psychological
coercion
on
the
petitioner.
as
far
as
the
petitioner
goes,
he
said
in
his
own
testimony
at
the
trial,
no,
he
did
not
wake
me
up
at
all.
officer
langford
said,
i
woke
him
up
about
twice,
once
or
twice.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
we
have
to
examine
each
word
that
meticulously
why
he
used
those
particular
words,
i
do
not
know.
but
i
think
if
you
view
the
facts
even
as
officer
langford
told
those
facts
that
it
does
not
come
close
to
any
of
the
cases
that
this
court
has
ruled
that
confession
was
coerced.
there
is
no
constant
questioning
by
a
large
number
of
officers
for
hours
on
end
in
the
odd
hours
of
the
morning.
officer
langford
said,
well,
he
woke
up
a
couple
of
times.
he
woke
up
easily,
but
he
did
not
question,
he
did
not
constantly
interrogate
him.
he
was
in
the
cell
and
occasionally
as
langford
tells
that
the
petitioner
even
denies
it
as
langford
tells
it.
he
says
well,
i
got
back
to
the
subject.
again,
i
accused
him
of
all
kinds
of
things
and
he
said
i
acted
crazy,
but
i
do
not
think
that
this
case
in
any
sense
compares
to
the
cases
where
this
court
has
ruled
that
a
confession
was
coerced.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
mr.
justice,
i
think
it
comes
much
closer
to
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
right,
it
does
not.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
he
does
not,
i
think
right.
i
think
those
two
issues
have
to
be
kept
very
clear
than
it
comes
much
closer
to
massiah.
i
think
we
have
urged
in
our
brief
that
massiah
should
not
be
extended
because
the
implications
of
it
are
that,
for
example
you
could
have
a
situation
where
you
say
well,
the
guard
in
the
jail
has
said
to
another
prisoner,
ask
him
if
he
killed
him
and
he
says,
yes,
i
killed
him,
the
guard,
and
you
say
well
the
guard
cannot
come
into
court.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
mr.
justice,
as
i
suggested
i
think
it
comes
closer
to
massiah
than
to
coercion.
i
do
not
think
massiah
should
necessarily
govern.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
yes,
your
honor
that
is
correct.
i
contend
it
is
distinguishable
and
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make
i
do
no
think
massiah
should
be
extended
beyond
its
facts
and
i
set
forth
irrational.
i
think
perhaps
the
most
important
issue
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
yes,
i
do.
in
that
particular
case,
however,
mr.
justice,
there
it
was
a
--
there
was
nothing
in
what
this
court
said
to
indicate
the
position
of
this
court.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
mr.
justice
it
has,
but
i
would
urge
that
it
should
not
be
extended
anymore
than
that
is
necessary.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
yes.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
i
have
them
here
somewhere,
but
at
the
moment
i
cannot
recall.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
yes.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
it
was
more
than
that,
36
to
40
hours
something.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
yes.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
correct.
i
would
like
to
point
to
the
other
issues
that
i
think
that
we
have
been
talking
about.
i
think
if
all
of
these,
i
have
been
presenting
these
arguments
as
even
as
i
think
perhaps
i
have
not
made
clear
to
the
court.
i
do
feel
that
if
you
feel
that
this
case
is
governed
by
massiah,
even
in
view
what
i
have
told
you
before
that
massiah
should
not
be
declared
retroactively.
up
to
this
point,
the
fourth
circuit
has
said
massiah
should
not
be
declared
retroactively.
now,
the
petitioner
suggests,
well,
that
this
would
be
a
normal
application.
i
do
not
think
that
in
modern
criminal
law,
retroactivity
is
a
normal
application
and
i
think
that
the
decision
of
this
--
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
made
that
absolutely
clear.
you
stated
the
factors
that
are
important.
you
stated
that
as
the
combination
of
those
factors
and
you
ruled
in
a
number
of
cases
on
whether
a
particular
decision
should
be
retroactive
or
not.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
same
rationale
was
governed
in
the
johnson
case,
the
same
rationale
which
governed
in
fact
in
linkletter
applied
in
this
particular
case.
we
talked
about
the
purpose
to
be
served.
the
purpose
to
be
served
in
this
particular
case
is
to
deter
the
police
from
interrogating
when
a
lawyer
is
not
present.
now,
that
purpose
has
already
been
solved
by
massiah.
to
make
massiah
retroactive
has
nothing
additional
to
the
utility,
to
the
practical
outcome
of
that
particular
decision.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
i
do
not
think
it
did,
mr.
justice.
i
did
not
feel
personally
reading
the
cases
of
this
court.
i
do
not
feel
and
i
did
not
feel
and
i
still
do
not
feel
that
that
single
explicit
point
is
telling
one
way
or
the
other.
i
think
the
rationale
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
yes.
yes,
the
prior
history,
prior
reliance.
it
gets
to
two
different
doctrines
which
have
been
stated
by
this
court.
i
do
not
think
that
specific
collection
alone
should
tell,
it
should
be
telling
in
terms
of
the
final
outcome
of
this
case.
i
do
feel
that
the
rationale
is
clear
or
not.
again,
it
is
a
combination
of
all
these
factors.
i
think
the
decisions
in
johnson,
the
decision
in
linkletter
make
it
clear
enough
that
the
purpose,
first
of
all,
the
purpose
would
not
be
served
by
making
it
retroactive.
secondly,
that
in
this
type
of
situation,
in
the
massiah
situation,
massiah,
the
confession
that
was
elicited
in
massiah
was
not
one
that
was
believed
to
be
coerced.
it
was
not
of
those
beliefs
to
be
unreliable.
in
fact,
there
was
believed
to
be
all
too
reliable
and
so
the
basis
for
getting
rid
of
that
kind
of
evidence
by
making
the
rule
retroactive
again
is
not
necessary
in
this
particular
situation.
we
are
not
talking
about
right
to
counsel
at
trial
which
so
infuses
the
entire
trial
with
possibilities
of
error
that
you
have
to
make
it
retroactive,
protect
the
right
of
the
individual.
third,
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
mr.
justice,
i
think
there
are
some
distinctions
there.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
your
honor,
i
feel
that
what
we
are
talking
about
in
those
two
decisions
are
distinguishable.
in
the
broad
sense,
they
are
talking
about
right
to
counsel,
but
massiah
is
very
specific
and
massiah
is
talking
about
a
situation
where
he
is
in
custody.
he
is
released
and
they
have
this
set
up
with
an
informer.
powell
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
and
he
has
been
indicted.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
yes.
in
this
particular
situation,
what
we
are
talking
--
in
powell,
what
we
were
talking
about
was
the
right
to
have
an
appointed
lawyer
in
a
capital
case
and
i
do
not
think
that
although
they
talk
about
the
sixth
amendment
guarantees
in
the
broad
context,
i
do
not
think
that
is
actually
the
same.
and
again,
in
terms
of
the
three
criteria
set
up
by
this
court,
i
do
no
think,
i
do
not
see
in
terms
of
the
decisions
on
miranda
and
escobedo,
i
do
not
see
any
of
the
possibility
logically
but
to
make
massiah
not
retroactive.
the
third
factor
is
the
strain
on
the
judicial
system
and
here
i
think
in
one
of
those
two
decisions
which
i
was
just
referring
to,
this
court
pointed
out
the
problems
related
to
hearings
on
evidence
long
destroyed
and
hearings
based
on
memories
that
are
deemed
by
time.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
mr.
justice,
i
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
mr.
justice
in
johnson
and
in
young
versus
the
united
states
in
the
fifth
circuit,
there
are
comments
to
the
effect
that
these
were
common
practices
and
i
think
that
there
is
enough
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
mr.
justice,
it
is
also
be
hard
to
get
statistics
on
that.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
no,
your
honor
this
trial
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
well,
the
other
--
well,
those
two
cases
suggest
it
is
not
a
rare
practice.
secondly,
--
oh!
my
time
has
expired.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
secondly,
i
think
that
one
of
the
problems
in
this
particular
type
of
situation
is
that
whether
or
not
there
is
a
great
deal
of
reliance.
a
lot
of
petitioners
are
going
to
be
sitting
there
and
thinking
well,
what
i
can
say
is
that
this
kind
of
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
duplicity
or
deception
was
practiced
on
me.
now,
let
us
go
and
get
an
evidentiary
hearing.
how
are
those
claims
going
to
be
solved?
the
reason
that
they
are
going
to
do
that
is
obvious.
they
cannot
get
miranda
and
escobedo
applied
retroactively
so
that
they
will
say,
well
i
will
change
my
story
so
that
it
falls
within
the
aegis
of
massiah
and
therefore
can
get
an
evidentiary
hearing
and
perhaps
get
a
new
trial
and
get
it
to
smith.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
well,
that
is
true
mr.
justice,
but
those
are
things
which
can
easily
be
established
in
one
way
or
another
by
the
record.
this
type
of
situation
cannot
so
easily
be
established
by
the
record.
he
could
say
well
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
it
was
in
this
case
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
well,
what
i
am
getting
at
is
that
within
the
board
preview
of
the
massiah,
a
prisoner
could
say,
well,
at
the
time
i
was
questioned
this
policeman
told
me,
he
was
someone
else
not
a
policemen,
but
someone
else.
now
i
realize
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
mr.
justice,
i
think
that
record
would
show
that
in
1970
or
1971
but
we
are
talking
about
a
case
which
took
place
before
massiah
and
those
records
would
not
have
raised
this
issue
of
deception
it
seems
to
me
because
i
do
not
think
it
as
ever
clear
at
that
time
and
this
court
points
it
out
in
johnson
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
well,
they
may
have
your
honor,
but
not
as
a
constitutional
right
which
was
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
yes,
it
is
possible.
it
is
possible,
but
not
always.
we
read
many
records
everyday.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
mr.
justice,
i
think
you
still
have
some
problems
because
there
are
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
not
that
problem,
but
you
still
have
problems.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
yes,
mr.
justice
we
are
talking
about
the
broad
application
of
this
rule
and
i
am
trying
to
suggest
that
consistent
with
standard
set
forth
by
this
court
massiah
should
not
be
applied
retroactively
and
i
have
been
trying
to
suggest
why
it
should
not
be.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
thank
you.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset
for
the
sake
of
clarification,
i
think
that
we
ought
to
talk
about
the
confessions,
that
were
involved.
in
fact,
i
think
if
you
--
the
best
way
to
look
at
this
confessions
is
one
the
major
confession
that
is
being
talked
about
in
the
petition
of
certiorari
which
was
the
confession
which
was
elicited
by
officer
langford
in
the
cell
of
the
petitioner.
secondly,
there
is
one
other
confession
which
also
was
discussed
by
the
courts
at
the
state
level
which
is
referred
to
in
the
petitioner’s
brief
as
405
confession.
in
fact
what
it
is
one
confession
that
was
taped,
that
was
transcribed,
that
was
changed,
that
was
initial,
but
essentially
we
have
two
and
the
second
one
i
refer
to
is
that
confession
which
was
made
to
officers
holmes
and
mcclure.
now,
there
is
in
fact
in
the
record
and
i
think
you
will
find
it
in
our
brief
one
statement
which
might
in
fact
be
considered
the
third
confession
and
that
statement
has
never
been
challenged
at
any
level
and
that
is
from
the
record
on
page
148
when
officer
mcgraw
arrived
at
the
scene
of
the
crime,
he
was
asked,
when
you
saw
this
defendant
lying
on
the
pavement,
describe
if
you
will
what
he
was
doing,
what
he
was
saying
if
anything?
he
replied,
well,
he
kept
insisting
he
drove
his
car
into
the
river.
now,
in
terms
of
argument,
this
is
quite
important
so
again
there
is
the
langford,
holmes,
and
mcclure
and
this
other
confession
of
officer
mcclure
and
i
think
that
these
distinctions
have
to
be
kept
in
mind.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
mr.
justice,
there
is
no
question
except
the
meaning
of
what
he
said.
that
is
why
i
am
saying
that
there
is
some,
you
could
call
that
a
third
confession,
whether
he
drove
it
or
not.
the
state’s
contention
–-
mr.
j.
robert
olian
mr.
justice,
the
state’s
contention
at
the
trial
was
he
did
not
drive
the
car
in
the
river.
he
jumped
out
of
the
car
before
it
went
into
the
river,
so
i
think
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
well,
in
this
case,
he
is
saying
in
effect
that
he
did
drive
it
into
river
whereas
at
the
trial
i
think
it
goes
more
of
the
question
of
credibility.
at
the
trial
what
he
said
was
he
blank
out;
he
does
not
remember
what
happened,
as
far
as
his
story
of
what
happened.
here
he
says,
yes
i
did
drive
into
the
river.
again,
i
think
this
is
equivocal,
but
i
think
it
raises
some
question
about
credibility
of
his
own
story
of
what
took
place
and
i
think
that
is
important
in
terms
of
the
facts
that
were
presented
at
this
trial
because
there
are
constant
discrepancies
in
terms
of
the
stories
that
were
told
and
i
think
there
are
constant
considerations
here
of
credibility.
i
would
like
to
talk
about
those
considerations
somewhat
further.
again,
that
is
equivocal
as
a
confession,
but
it
does
disagree
with
the
story
that
he
told
he
blanked
out
that
he
does
not
remember
what
happened.
so
how
does
this
is
interpreted
is
not
totally
clear.
and
far
as
the
facts
in
this
case
go,
there
are
number
of
things,
it
was
stated
by
the
petitioner
and
he
was
questioned
almost
daily.
a
couple
of
these
questioning
periods
had
to
do
with
cases
which
were
another
jurisdictions
that
are
asked
when
you
hold
him
for
investigation?
they
came
down,
they
did
interrogate
him.
the
longest
questioning
period
was
one
where
the
--
it
was
either
polk,
florida
or
mississippi,
i
feel
which
one
of
the
two
came
down
questioning
for
six
hours
about
another
alleged
crime.
now,
they
asked
him
at
the
state
hearing
and
this
quite
important
and
it
is
in
our
brief,
they
said
to
him,
you
were
not
questioned
between
the
4th
and
11th?
now
you
notice,
they
are
saying
constant
questioning,
long
questioning,
great
deal
of
psychological
coercion
and
pressure
and
this
kind
of
thing.
the
petitioner
was
asked,
you
were
not
questioned
between
the
4th
and
the
11th?
he
answered,
i
could
have
been.
the
court:
not
could
have
been,
were
you
or
were
you
not.
you
were
there,
you
know
about
it.
you
are
the
only
one
that
can
tell
us
and
it
is
in
the
petitioner
from
the
4th
day
to
the
11th,
i
believe
that
i
was
questioned,
i
mean,
i
was
trying
to
think.
i
believe,
i
was
questioned
sometimes
during
the
time
from
the
4th
to
the
11th
and
on
it
goes,
he
can
identify
three
periods
your
honor,
the
longest
period
being
roughly
one-and-a-half
hours
during
this
time
that
he
was
held
for
questioning.
so
this
matter
of
constant
questioning
in
terms
of
all
the
confessions,
now
this
goes
to
the
holmes
and
mcclure
confession
which
is
not
the
one
which
is
a
primary
basis
for
the
petition
here.
he
says
--
the
petitioner
claims
well,
he
was
asked
to
write
to
his
wife’s
family.
this
has
to
be
clarified.
he
apparently
has
another
wife.
minnie
is
not
his
real
wife
as
far
we
can
tell
and
he
would
said
no,
i
could
not,
i
could
not,
i
was
not
even
allowed
to
write
to
her.
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
appendix,
you
will
find
three
pages
later
where
he
say,
yes,
i
did
write
her.
he
said
i
was
not
even
given
stationery,
three
pages
later,
he
said
yes,
i
did
write
to
her.
now,
another
point
as
far
as
facts
goes,
the
petitioner
points
out
this
is
a
common
type
of
policy.
i
think
it
is
also
worth
pointing
out
that
in
the
record,
john
tyler
took
the
stand.
he
said,
i
was
asked
by
the
petitioner
where
i
could
get
in
his
own
words
a
good
insurance.
i
think
it
is
also
very
important
to
know
that
the
petitioner
was
unable
to
sustain
and
so
very
effectively,
in
fact
one
witness
took
the
stand,
told
him
how
he
hacked
the
suit
for
$2.00
because
he
was
short
of
cash
yet
he
managed
to
keep
up
the
payments
on
these
insurance
policies.
now,
with
that
in
mind,
i
would
like
to
get
to
the
issues
in
terms
of
the
structure
of
our
brief.
first
of
all
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
and
rely
for
the
langford
confession,
if
there
is
any
error
at
all
which
we
deny
and
i
like
to
get
to
this
in
more
details
in
a
moment,
but
if
there
is
any
error
at
all
it
is
clearly
harmless
error.
first,
we
still
have
the
holmes
and
mcclure
confession.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
that
is
correct
your
honor.
that
was
never
brought
up
to
that
court
and
i
think
that
as
we
pointed
in
our
brief
that
the
cases
by
this
court
have
said
if
you
do
not
raise
that
in
your
petition
that
perhaps
should
not
be
considered
by
this
court.
but
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
no,
i
am
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
right.
no,
i
was
talking
about
from
the
petitioner's
side.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
no,
i
was
not
referring
to
that
point,
your
honor.
he
was
not
bringing
up
this
other
confession.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
yes.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
yes.
as
far
as
the
evidence
was
involved,
we
have
the
confession.
we
have
the
evidence.
part
of
the
evidence
goes
in
this
case
there
is
--
that
was
overwhelming
proof
of
guilt.
i
will
just
go
through
some
of
these
facts
very
quickly
because
they
are
not
all
in
the
appendix.
it
is
a
very
long
record,
but
we
did
cite
these
facts
in
our
brief.
first
of
all,
his
car
was
purchased
nine
hours
before
this
accident
took
place.
i
told
you
about
the
insurance.
much
of
this
insurance
will
only
pay
in
case
of
accident.
it
will
not
pay
in
case
of
natural
death.
there
is
a
lot
of
testimony
about
his
relationship
toward
the
deceased,
minnie
claybon
that
he
does
not
particularly
care
for
her
that
he
has
written
to
others
how
he
was
coming
to
a
great
deal
of
money
which
would
further
his
boxing
career.
if
you
look
at
the
record
on
page
150
to
152,
it
tells
us
some
important
things
about
the
scene
of
the
accident.
it
was
well
lit.
there
was
good
weather.
utmost,
there
was
one
space
with
estimates
ranging
from
15
to
25
feet
of
opening.
the
rest
was
a
solid
line
of
both,
so
that
if
someone
lost
control
of
the
car,
the
odds
i
am
getting
in
that
particular
15
to
20
foot
opening
certainly
were
not
very
great
and
your
honors
this
is
particularly
important
in
this
trial.
the
back
windows
in
this
car
were
closed.
the
deceased
was
sitting
on
the
back
seat.
the
back
doors
could
not
be
opened.
they
were
latched
closed.
now,
the
previous
owner
of
the
car
was
asked
about
the
car
and
what
he
testified
to
was
this.
those
ornaments
had
never
kept
the
back
doors
closed,
that
the
doors
freely
opened.
that
at
the
time
of
the
accident,
the
police
officers
pointed
out
that
when
they
removed
the
car
from
the
miami
river,
they
had
to
use
tools
to
get
those
doors
open.
at
that
trial,
they
pointed
out
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
scratches
or
anything
else
on
these
chrome
ornaments
which
indicated
that
they
were
forced
closed
by
the
collision,
by
going
into
the
water
at
that
time.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
is
also
true
when
you
coprolite
with
the
confession
to
holmes
and
mcclure
which
was
at
no
point
in
the
federal
courts
raised
in
or
on
that
particular
regard.
now,
i
think
that
confession
is
particularly
important
and
i
think
two
things
ought
to
be
noticed,
not
only
about
that
confession
which
i
think
adds
to
the
harmless
error
argument
but
the
confession
to
langford.
i
think
when
you
examine
this
trial
transcript,
you
find
a
tremendous
concern
of
the
trial
judge
for
a
fair
trial.
a
meticulous
examination
of
all
the
parties
involved,
he
used
that
procedure
which
was
proscribed
by
this
court
in
jackson
v.
doe.
they
went
into
all
the
details
and
great
detail
and
decided
that
it
was
admissible.
it
was
not
until
then
that
it
was
turned
over
to
the
jury.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
your
honor
the
holmes
and
mcclure
was
put
in
and
put
in
detail
and
the
langford
testimony
was
put
in
and
put
in
detail.
although,
the
petitioner
suggested
that
the
langford
was
the
most
important,
i
think
if
you
examine
the
transcript,
examine
the
length
of
the
trial
you
discover
that
very
clearly
both
of
these
confessions
were
put
into
evidence
with
great
force.
so
the
holmes
and
mcclure
confession
is
just
important.
your
honors,
i
think
that
if
you
also
examine
in
relation
to
the
holmes
and
mcclure
confession
and
the
other
confession,
the
instructions
of
the
judge
to
the
jury,
you
find
again
evidence
of
this
very
meticulous
concern
that
he
cautioned
him
that
as
to
the
reconsidering
whether
or
not
the
confessions
were
voluntary
and
he
told
them,
they
could
disregard
them
entirely
if
they
so
desired.
i
think
that
what
also
was
important
as
some
of
the
evidence
of
other
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
specifically
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
your
honor,
i
think
he
did
not
separate
the
two
confessions
as
he
talked
about
confessions
and
their
voluntariness.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
well,
i
do
not
think
that
--
yes
inherently
he
would
think
so.
they
examined
this
thoroughly
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury
and
they
submitted
to
the
jury
with
these
cautionary
instructions,
i
do
not
think
it
is
a
layman
thing
it
seems.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
mr.
justice
i
had
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
mr.
justice
i
have
no
idea.
this
trial
took
place
in
1958
and
i
think
the
total
atmosphere
at
that
time
was
quite
different.
what
they
did,
i
think
what
their
motives
were
impossible
to
decide
at
this
time.
i
think
as
a
matter
of
law
however,
i
do
feel
that
these
factors
were
effectively
handled
at
trial
and
that
is
the
point
that
i
am
trying
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
your
honor,
i
cited
harrington
and
chapman
and
i
think
that
they
talked
about
the
proposition
here
that
(voice
overlap).
mr.
j.
robert
olian
your
honor,
first
of
all
i
am
not
saying
it
is
involuntary.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
your
honor,
i
would
make
a
distinction.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
well,
i
would
make
a
distinction
it
seems
to
me
in
terms
of
the
case
law
between
a
coerced
confession
and
a
confession
which
violates
his
right.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
and
i
think
it
has
to
be
one
or
the
other.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
in
the
sense
of
the
coercion?
mr.
j.
robert
olian
then
i
would
not
be
arguing
harmless
error
in
that
kind.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
yes,
i
think
harmless
error
applies
in
that
context.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
well,
that
is
not
the
issue
which
i
have
gotten
to.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
yes
mr.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
well
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
your
honor,
i
said
that
in
our
brief
we
say
that
harrington
and
chapman
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
well,
it
is
not
exactly
the
same,
but
we
do
have
confessions
which
were
inadmissible.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
any
mir
--
no,
i
am
sorry
your
honor.
i
did
not
cite
any.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
of
hand,
i
do
not
know.
i
am
sorry.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
your
honor,
my
reading
of
the
case
which
suggested
to
me
that
way
we
only
found
that
a
confession
was
coerced
in
the
sense
of
psychological
and
physical
and
a
like,
that
is
true.
i
do
not
feel
that
in
terms
of
a
massiah
type
situation
that
that
rule
should
be
applied.
i
do
not
think
it
is
the
same
kind
of
thing.
i
think
what
we
are
talking
about
is
a
situation
and
again,
i
am
not
granting
that
massiah
governs
this.
i
am
not
granting
that
massiah
should
be
granted
retroactively,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
abridgment
of
that
sixth
amendment
right
under
those
circumstances
should
not
automatically
result
in
a
reversal.
i
think
in
that
context,
yes,
the
harmless
error
doctrine
in
that
context
should
apply.
that
is
how
i
read
the
case
that
the
petitioner
is
primarily
relying
upon
how
i
read
the
case
of
this
court
and
that
is
what
i
am
urging.
i
think
perhaps,
i
ought
to
turn
to
the
question
of
massiah
in
retroactivity.
i
suggest
in
my
brief
and
i
would
get
to
this
quickly
as
far
as
the
facts
go
that
i
do
not
feel
it
is
desirable
to
extend
massiah
and
i
think
that
particularly
we
pointed
out
that
in
this
case,
what
you
have
is
the
situation
where
every
prisoner
volunteered
his
information
to
a
total
stranger,
i
think
it
is
a
distinction
worth
considering
because
i
think
if
massiah
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
i
might
have
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
yes,
i
do.
i
do.
i
think
if
you
will
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
mr.
justice,
we
are
talking
about
the
statements
to
officer
langford
now
who
is
put
in
the
cell.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
and
in
that
case,
i
think
if
you
look
at
what
the
petitioner
said
at
the
trial
he
said,
he
did
no
not
even
talk
to
the
man.
now
later
in
his
petition,
now
he
turns
around
and
says,
oh!
yes,
he
elicited
a
confession
from
me
but
at
the
trial
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
it
was
a
matter
of
hours.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
oh!
it
was
more
than
a
day,
yes,
but
it
was
something
like
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
well,
what
i
am
saying
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
mr.
justice,
what
i
mean
in
this
situation
is
that
what
happened
in
that
cell
did
not
amend
what
the
first
coerced
confession.
what
did
he
do?
he
asked
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
mr.
justice,
there
are
cases
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
mr.
justice,
there
are
cases
that
this
court
has
ruled
down
which
come
close
to
the
fact
what
you
are
talking
about
which
this
court
has
said
are
coercion.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
yes,
mr.
justice
i
think
there
are
a
lot
of
differences.
i
think
what
has
happened
here
is
that
is
he
in
the
cell
and
he
has
asking
some
questions.
he
made
some
absurd
accusations.
he
said
what
kind
of
psychological
inducement
was
there?
well,
he
shared
his
oatmeal
in
the
morning.
he
let
him
steal
some
candy
bars
and
a
few
times
he
said,
boy,
i
acted
crazy!
now,
i
do
not
think
that
that
is
psychological
coercion
on
the
petitioner.
as
far
as
the
petitioner
goes,
he
said
in
his
own
testimony
at
the
trial,
no,
he
did
not
wake
me
up
at
all.
officer
langford
said,
i
woke
him
up
about
twice,
once
or
twice.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
we
have
to
examine
each
word
that
meticulously
why
he
used
those
particular
words,
i
do
not
know.
but
i
think
if
you
view
the
facts
even
as
officer
langford
told
those
facts
that
it
does
not
come
close
to
any
of
the
cases
that
this
court
has
ruled
that
confession
was
coerced.
there
is
no
constant
questioning
by
a
large
number
of
officers
for
hours
on
end
in
the
odd
hours
of
the
morning.
officer
langford
said,
well,
he
woke
up
a
couple
of
times.
he
woke
up
easily,
but
he
did
not
question,
he
did
not
constantly
interrogate
him.
he
was
in
the
cell
and
occasionally
as
langford
tells
that
the
petitioner
even
denies
it
as
langford
tells
it.
he
says
well,
i
got
back
to
the
subject.
again,
i
accused
him
of
all
kinds
of
things
and
he
said
i
acted
crazy,
but
i
do
not
think
that
this
case
in
any
sense
compares
to
the
cases
where
this
court
has
ruled
that
a
confession
was
coerced.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
mr.
justice,
i
think
it
comes
much
closer
to
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
right,
it
does
not.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
he
does
not,
i
think
right.
i
think
those
two
issues
have
to
be
kept
very
clear
than
it
comes
much
closer
to
massiah.
i
think
we
have
urged
in
our
brief
that
massiah
should
not
be
extended
because
the
implications
of
it
are
that,
for
example
you
could
have
a
situation
where
you
say
well,
the
guard
in
the
jail
has
said
to
another
prisoner,
ask
him
if
he
killed
him
and
he
says,
yes,
i
killed
him,
the
guard,
and
you
say
well
the
guard
cannot
come
into
court.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
mr.
justice,
as
i
suggested
i
think
it
comes
closer
to
massiah
than
to
coercion.
i
do
not
think
massiah
should
necessarily
govern.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
yes,
your
honor
that
is
correct.
i
contend
it
is
distinguishable
and
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make
i
do
no
think
massiah
should
be
extended
beyond
its
facts
and
i
set
forth
irrational.
i
think
perhaps
the
most
important
issue
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
yes,
i
do.
in
that
particular
case,
however,
mr.
justice,
there
it
was
a
--
there
was
nothing
in
what
this
court
said
to
indicate
the
position
of
this
court.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
mr.
justice
it
has,
but
i
would
urge
that
it
should
not
be
extended
anymore
than
that
is
necessary.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
yes.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
i
have
them
here
somewhere,
but
at
the
moment
i
cannot
recall.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
yes.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
it
was
more
than
that,
36
to
40
hours
something.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
yes.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
correct.
i
would
like
to
point
to
the
other
issues
that
i
think
that
we
have
been
talking
about.
i
think
if
all
of
these,
i
have
been
presenting
these
arguments
as
even
as
i
think
perhaps
i
have
not
made
clear
to
the
court.
i
do
feel
that
if
you
feel
that
this
case
is
governed
by
massiah,
even
in
view
what
i
have
told
you
before
that
massiah
should
not
be
declared
retroactively.
up
to
this
point,
the
fourth
circuit
has
said
massiah
should
not
be
declared
retroactively.
now,
the
petitioner
suggests,
well,
that
this
would
be
a
normal
application.
i
do
not
think
that
in
modern
criminal
law,
retroactivity
is
a
normal
application
and
i
think
that
the
decision
of
this
--
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
made
that
absolutely
clear.
you
stated
the
factors
that
are
important.
you
stated
that
as
the
combination
of
those
factors
and
you
ruled
in
a
number
of
cases
on
whether
a
particular
decision
should
be
retroactive
or
not.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
same
rationale
was
governed
in
the
johnson
case,
the
same
rationale
which
governed
in
fact
in
linkletter
applied
in
this
particular
case.
we
talked
about
the
purpose
to
be
served.
the
purpose
to
be
served
in
this
particular
case
is
to
deter
the
police
from
interrogating
when
a
lawyer
is
not
present.
now,
that
purpose
has
already
been
solved
by
massiah.
to
make
massiah
retroactive
has
nothing
additional
to
the
utility,
to
the
practical
outcome
of
that
particular
decision.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
i
do
not
think
it
did,
mr.
justice.
i
did
not
feel
personally
reading
the
cases
of
this
court.
i
do
not
feel
and
i
did
not
feel
and
i
still
do
not
feel
that
that
single
explicit
point
is
telling
one
way
or
the
other.
i
think
the
rationale
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
yes.
yes,
the
prior
history,
prior
reliance.
it
gets
to
two
different
doctrines
which
have
been
stated
by
this
court.
i
do
not
think
that
specific
collection
alone
should
tell,
it
should
be
telling
in
terms
of
the
final
outcome
of
this
case.
i
do
feel
that
the
rationale
is
clear
or
not.
again,
it
is
a
combination
of
all
these
factors.
i
think
the
decisions
in
johnson,
the
decision
in
linkletter
make
it
clear
enough
that
the
purpose,
first
of
all,
the
purpose
would
not
be
served
by
making
it
retroactive.
secondly,
that
in
this
type
of
situation,
in
the
massiah
situation,
massiah,
the
confession
that
was
elicited
in
massiah
was
not
one
that
was
believed
to
be
coerced.
it
was
not
of
those
beliefs
to
be
unreliable.
in
fact,
there
was
believed
to
be
all
too
reliable
and
so
the
basis
for
getting
rid
of
that
kind
of
evidence
by
making
the
rule
retroactive
again
is
not
necessary
in
this
particular
situation.
we
are
not
talking
about
right
to
counsel
at
trial
which
so
infuses
the
entire
trial
with
possibilities
of
error
that
you
have
to
make
it
retroactive,
protect
the
right
of
the
individual.
third,
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
mr.
justice,
i
think
there
are
some
distinctions
there.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
your
honor,
i
feel
that
what
we
are
talking
about
in
those
two
decisions
are
distinguishable.
in
the
broad
sense,
they
are
talking
about
right
to
counsel,
but
massiah
is
very
specific
and
massiah
is
talking
about
a
situation
where
he
is
in
custody.
he
is
released
and
they
have
this
set
up
with
an
informer.
powell
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
and
he
has
been
indicted.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
yes.
in
this
particular
situation,
what
we
are
talking
--
in
powell,
what
we
were
talking
about
was
the
right
to
have
an
appointed
lawyer
in
a
capital
case
and
i
do
not
think
that
although
they
talk
about
the
sixth
amendment
guarantees
in
the
broad
context,
i
do
not
think
that
is
actually
the
same.
and
again,
in
terms
of
the
three
criteria
set
up
by
this
court,
i
do
no
think,
i
do
not
see
in
terms
of
the
decisions
on
miranda
and
escobedo,
i
do
not
see
any
of
the
possibility
logically
but
to
make
massiah
not
retroactive.
the
third
factor
is
the
strain
on
the
judicial
system
and
here
i
think
in
one
of
those
two
decisions
which
i
was
just
referring
to,
this
court
pointed
out
the
problems
related
to
hearings
on
evidence
long
destroyed
and
hearings
based
on
memories
that
are
deemed
by
time.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
mr.
justice,
i
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
mr.
justice
in
johnson
and
in
young
versus
the
united
states
in
the
fifth
circuit,
there
are
comments
to
the
effect
that
these
were
common
practices
and
i
think
that
there
is
enough
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
mr.
justice,
it
is
also
be
hard
to
get
statistics
on
that.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
no,
your
honor
this
trial
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
well,
the
other
--
well,
those
two
cases
suggest
it
is
not
a
rare
practice.
secondly,
--
oh!
my
time
has
expired.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
secondly,
i
think
that
one
of
the
problems
in
this
particular
type
of
situation
is
that
whether
or
not
there
is
a
great
deal
of
reliance.
a
lot
of
petitioners
are
going
to
be
sitting
there
and
thinking
well,
what
i
can
say
is
that
this
kind
of
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
duplicity
or
deception
was
practiced
on
me.
now,
let
us
go
and
get
an
evidentiary
hearing.
how
are
those
claims
going
to
be
solved?
the
reason
that
they
are
going
to
do
that
is
obvious.
they
cannot
get
miranda
and
escobedo
applied
retroactively
so
that
they
will
say,
well
i
will
change
my
story
so
that
it
falls
within
the
aegis
of
massiah
and
therefore
can
get
an
evidentiary
hearing
and
perhaps
get
a
new
trial
and
get
it
to
smith.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
well,
that
is
true
mr.
justice,
but
those
are
things
which
can
easily
be
established
in
one
way
or
another
by
the
record.
this
type
of
situation
cannot
so
easily
be
established
by
the
record.
he
could
say
well
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
it
was
in
this
case
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
well,
what
i
am
getting
at
is
that
within
the
board
preview
of
the
massiah,
a
prisoner
could
say,
well,
at
the
time
i
was
questioned
this
policeman
told
me,
he
was
someone
else
not
a
policemen,
but
someone
else.
now
i
realize
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
mr.
justice,
i
think
that
record
would
show
that
in
1970
or
1971
but
we
are
talking
about
a
case
which
took
place
before
massiah
and
those
records
would
not
have
raised
this
issue
of
deception
it
seems
to
me
because
i
do
not
think
it
as
ever
clear
at
that
time
and
this
court
points
it
out
in
johnson
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
well,
they
may
have
your
honor,
but
not
as
a
constitutional
right
which
was
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
yes,
it
is
possible.
it
is
possible,
but
not
always.
we
read
many
records
everyday.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
mr.
justice,
i
think
you
still
have
some
problems
because
there
are
--
mr.
j.
robert
olian
not
that
problem,
but
you
still
have
problems.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
yes,
mr.
justice
we
are
talking
about
the
broad
application
of
this
rule
and
i
am
trying
to
suggest
that
consistent
with
standard
set
forth
by
this
court
massiah
should
not
be
applied
retroactively
and
i
have
been
trying
to
suggest
why
it
should
not
be.
mr.
j.
robert
olian
thank
you.
