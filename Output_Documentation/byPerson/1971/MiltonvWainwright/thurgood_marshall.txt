justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
there
any
question
that
he
drove
the
car
in
the
river?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
confession
that
he
drove
the
car
in
the
river
has
nothing
to
do
with
murder,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
how
does
this
confession
help
you
on
that
point?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
there
any
suggestions
particularly
as
to
the
police
in
his
testimony?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
is
just
general
as
to
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
i
mean,
as
he
as
a
layman,
would
he
not
think
that
his
talk
with
the
policeman
was
voluntary?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
did
the
state
kept
it
less
then?
what
was
the
reason
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice
overlap)
i
have
this
in
few
parts.
one,
why
did
he
get
it
and
then
why
did
you
use
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
could
you
get
to
this
volunteer?
is
that
the
word
you
just
used?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
really
mean
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
the
basis
of
this
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
days
was
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
a
matter
of
whole
day?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
if
he
volunteered,
why
did
it
take
that
long
for
him
to
volunteer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
do
not
really
mean
he
volunteered?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
when
he
was
first
arrested,
the
police
questioned
him
in
when
they
first
picked
him
up
and
then
questioned
him
again
later
in
the
afternoon
and
then
the
next
morning,
woke
him
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
questioned
him
and
then
woke
him
up
again
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
questioned
him,
would
you
think
that
would
be
coercive?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
consider
that
to
be
coercive?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
now
the
only
difference
is
that
in
my
hypothetical,
the
man
knew
he
was
police
and
in
this
case
he
did
not
know
he
was
a
police,
are
there
any
other
differences?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
point
in
this
question
is,
how
do
explain
mr.
langford’s
statement
that
“he
broke
down?”
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
massiah
specifically
said
that
this
is
true
since
powell
against
alabama?
justice
thurgood
marshall
right,
that
is
on
page
205.
this
yields
no
more
than
reflects
the
constitutional
principle
established
long
ago
as
powell
v.
alabama
and
then
it
quotes
in
trial.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
we
do
not
have
any
problems
if
the
record
is
like
this?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean
you
got
that
problem?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
on
the
case
right
now?
justice
