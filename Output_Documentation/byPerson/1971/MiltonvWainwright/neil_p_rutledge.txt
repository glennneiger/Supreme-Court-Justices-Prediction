mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
on
review
of
a
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
which
affirmed
a
denial
of
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
which
was
challenging
a
conviction
of
first-degree
murder
in
the
state
courts
of
florida.
the
first-degree
murder
conviction
occurred
in
1958
and
became
final,
that
is
in
the
sense,
that
the
appeal
procedures
were
completed
and
the
time
expired
for
petition
of
certiorari
in
this
court
in
1960
after,
i
mention
that
fact
because
this
is
after
of
course
the
decision
of
this
court
in
spano
versus
new
york,
a
1959
decision
which
occurred
after
the
conviction
of
the
trial
court
before
that
conviction
became
final.
the
facts
involving
the
alleged
crime
itself
are
fairly
simple.
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
the
defendant
in
the
state
trial
court
was
a
black
man
from
mississippi.
he
had
completed
less
than
six
years
of
schooling
in
the
mississippi
schools.
he
was
age
23
at
the
time
of
his
conviction.
he
was
working
as
a
porter
in
a
miami
beach
hotel
and
he
was
living
in
the
black
ghetto
section
of
miami
with
his
common-law-wife
who
was
at
that
time
pregnant.
on
the
evening
of
may
31,
after
he
got
off
work,
he
purchased
a
cheap
used
car
for
approximately
a
$100.00
and
then
that
evening
he
took
his
wife
out
for
a
joy
ride
which
ran
through
the
evening
and
apparently
there
was
some
drinking
during
the
course
of
that
evening
in
the
ride
in
the
new
car.
in
the
early
morning
hours
of
june
1,
that
is
about
2
or
3
a.m.,
he
ran
the
car
into
the
miami
river
and
his
wife
was
drowned.
the
petitioner
himself
barely
escaped
with
his
life.
he
was
fished
out
of
the
miami
river
by
a
boat
captain
and
he
was
incoherent
and
he
injured.
he
was
prostrate
on
the
bank
of
the
river
when
the
police
came
and
the
police
took
him
to
the
dade
county
hospital
where
he
was
admitted
to
the
colored
section,
the
hospital
at
that
time
being
segregated,
and
he
was
held
there
overnight
and
then
the
next
day,
he
was
taken
to
the
city
jail.
no
charge
was
made
against
him
and
he
was
placed
in
the
city
jail
in
a
cell
3
feet
or
4
feet
x
6
feet
in
dimensions
with
no
windows
and
with
a
solid
door.
there
was
electric
light
in
the
cell
which
at
times
would
be
turned
on
and
other
times
he
would
be
in
complete
darkness
and
he
was
held
incommunicado
in
that
box
of
the
cell
for
16
days.
during
that
time,
he
was
taken
out
from
time
to
time
for
interrogation.
he
was
put
in
that
cell
on
june
2.
on
june
3,
he
was
taken
out
early
in
the
morning
about
6
a.m.
and
was
taken
by
a
detective
to
a
room
where
a
medical
doctor,
a
psychiatrist
and
a
ph.
d.
psychologist
administered
truth
serum
to
him,
shoot
in
the
arm
with
a
truth
serum,
he
was
then
questioned.
of
course
he
had
no
lawyer,
he
had
no
friends,
and
he
was
not
allowed
to
make
any
telephone
calls.
he
asked
to
call
his
wife’s
family,
but
he
was
not
allowed
to
communicate
in
any
way
with
the
outside
world.
after
the
session
with
the
doctors
and
under
the
truth
serum
he
was
then
the
next
day
taken
out
and
hooked
up
the
wires
to
use
his
words
and
administered
a
polygraph
test.
and
then
the
day
following
that,
he
was
again
questioned
at
which
time
an
alleged
consent
to
search
his
rooming
his
quarters
were
extracted
from
him
and
pursuant
to
that
alleged
consent,
the
detectives
and
the
medical
examiner
of
the
county
searched
his
quarters.
he
was
questioned
again
at
various
times,
he
says
almost
daily,
for
long
periods,
up
until
june
11,
at
which
time
he
was
taken
from
his
cell
at
about
5
p.m.,
and
was
not
returned
to
the
cell
until
about
1
a.m.
the
following
morning
and
during
that
time
from
5
p.m.
of
june
11
until
the
early
morning
hours
of
june
12,
two
confessions
were
extracted
from
him.
he
claims
and
the
evidence,
of
course
he
is
in
dispute
on
this,
he
claims
that
he
was
subjected
to
threats
and
coercion
that
the
detectives
threatened
to
take
him
for
a
ride
out
in
the
country
and
so
forth
at
that
time
and
that
he
had
no
choice
ultimately,
but
to
agree
to
confess
that
he
had
driven
into
the
river
deliberately
in
order
to
murder
his
wife,
the
motive
being
to
collect
insurance
on
her
life
and
it
is
true
that
he
had
an
insurance
policy.
actually,
it
was
a
policy
that
covered
both
him
and
his
wife.
it
covered
healthcare
and
it
was
an
accidental
death
policy.
it
is
one
of
these
policies
that
is
commonly
sold
in
the
black
ghetto
where
the
collector
comes
around
every
week
and
it
is
very
expensive
insurance
actually,
but
you
pay
your
premiums
in
cash
each
week.
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
a
relatively
short
time.
i
think
the
policy
had
been
in
effect
only
several
months.
i
am
not
sure
that
the
precise
date
that
the
policy
was
taken
out
appears
in
the
record,
but
there
is
some
evidence
from
which
you
could
conclude
that
he
originally
had
one
kind
of
policy
and
then
he
changed
it
comparatively
short
time
before
this
incident.
during
this
session
on
june
11,
he
was
questioned
in
extensive
by
two
detectives,
detective
holmes
(ph)
and
detective
mcclure
(ph)
and
they
resorted
to
the
rather
customary
technique
of
tandem
questioning
that
is
one
man
would
question
while
the
other
one
is
in
a
secret
room
adjoining
from
which
he
could
observe
through
a
one-way
mirror
what
was
going
on
and
of
course
unbeknown
to
him
the
room
was
wired
so
that
whatever
he
said
in
there
would
be
recorded.
the
man
in
the
secret
room
behind
the
one-way
mirror
could
turn
on
the
recording
device
and
record
what
was
said.
the
detective
testified
that
he
had
only
one
hour
of
tape
and
so
out
of
the
entire
time
from
5
p.m.
until
1
a.m.
that
he
was
out
of
his
cell,
only
one
hour
was
put
on
tape
and
the
tape
begins
at
a
point
where
the
petitioner
was
saying
that
he
wanted
to
confess
and
that
he
proposed
a
little
charade
where
he
would
go
out
of
the
room
and
then
knock
on
the
door
and
come
in
and
say,
i
am
appearing
here
voluntarily
to
confess
and
that
it
was
stated
that
he
had
asked
that
this
little
charade
be
gone
through
in
order
to
demonstrate
that
he
was
doing
this
voluntarily
and
freely.
he
says
that
he
would
had
been
coerced
into
doing
this
and
once
he
decided
he
had
to
confess
why
he
wanted
to
get
whatever
benefit
he
could
from
it.
in
any
event,
it
was
only
after
they
had
extracted
these
confessions
on
june
11
that
and
then
the
next
day
on
the
12th,
they
took
him
down
to
the
scene
of
the
incident
and
took
photographs
of
him
that
was
in
the
sense
the
third
confession,
the
first
one
was
on
tape,
the
second
was
a
transcribe,
a
secretary
typed
up
confession
which
he
signed.
the
third
was
this
incident
on
the
12th
when
he
was
taken
to
the
scene
and
then
again
on
the
afternoon
of
the
12th
he
asked
to
change
his
statement
and
a
fourth
confession
was
typed
up
which
he
signed.
only
after
that
was
an
attempt
made
to
arrest
him
for
any
specific
crime.
after
these
confessions
were
extracted,
the
detective
went
down
to
the
magistrate
and
swore
out
a
warrant
for
his
arrest
for
first-degree
murder.
this
resulted
in
his
being
transferred
from
the
city
jail
to
the
county
jail
and
then
in
the
county
jail,
he
was
allowed
finally
to
make
a
telephone
call.
he
called
out
and
obtained
a
lawyer
immediately,
but
even
though
he
had
been
arrested
and
changed
to
the
county
jail,
he
still
was
not
brought
before
any
committee
magistrate
and
the
attorney
that
he
was
able
to
contact
by
making
a
telephone
call
on
june
19
filed
a
habeas
corpus
petition
which
resulted
in
a
preliminary
hearing
and
at
that
time
he
was
brought
finally
before
a
magistrate
and
was
committed
over
to
the
grand
jury
and
the
grand
jury
indicted
him
for
first-degree
murder
on
july
1,
1958.
he
was
not
able
to
post
bail
and
so
he
was
held
in
the
county
jail
pending
his
trial
which
occurred
in
december
of
1958.
on
july
18,
the
state
for
some
reason,
unexplained,
feeling
that
it
needed
more
information
from
him,
knowing
that
he
was
represented
by
counsel,
knowing
that
he
had
been
indicted
decided
that
the
way
to
obtain
this
information
was
not
in
a
straightforward
way
by
either
approaching
his
counsel
or
even
by
as
calling
him
in
and
seeing
if
he
would
voluntarily
answer
questions.
instead,
they
resorted
to
the
technique
of
taking
a
negro
police
officer
and
dressing
him
in
civilian
clothes
and
having
him
pose
as
a
fellow
prisoner
and
one
who
supposedly
was
in
jail
being
held
also
on
a
charge
of
murder.
and
this
police
officer
whose
name
is
archie
langford
entered
petitioner’s
cell
on
july
18
at
about
4
or
5
p.m.
and
then
stayed
in
that
cell
continuously
with
him
except
for
one
brief
moment
when
he
was
taken
out
shortly
after
he
entered
the
cell
on
that
friday,
july
18
evening.
other
than
that
short
time
of
less
than
five
minutes
when
he
was
taken
from
the
cell,
officer
langford
was
in
the
cell
continuously
for
45
--
approximately
45
hours
from
4
to
5
p.m.
on
friday,
i
mean,
excuse
me,
from
7
to
8
p.m.
on
friday
until
4
to
5
p.m.
on
the
following
sunday.
the
testimony
of
officer
langford
is
clear
that
he
was
trying
to
extract
information.
he
went
into
the
cell
with
instructions
to
get
information
from
the
petitioner
and
he
tried
to
get
petitioner
to
talk
about
his
case.
petitioner
refused.
petitioner
told
him
that
he
had
been
instructed
by
his
lawyer
not
to
talk
about
his
case
and
he
repeatedly,
over
and
over
and
over
again,
said
i
do
not
want
to
talk
about
the
case.
he
did
not
talk
about
the
case
that
friday
even
though
that
friday
evening
he
was
woken
up
out
his
sleep
by
the
officer
and
still
refused
to,
the
following
morning
he
refused
to
talk
about
his
case.
it
was
not
until
approximately
noon
the
following
day
that
the
officer
by
use
of
rather
clever
and
adroit
psychological
techniques
was
able
to
get
the
petitioner
to
start
talking
in
little
bits
and
phrases
about
the
case
and
then
it
really
was
not
until
in
the
wee
small
hours
of
sunday
morning
that
as
officer
langford
describes
it
himself,
the
petitioner
broke
down
under
this
continuous
pressure
and
told,
as
officer
langford
states
it,
the
full
story
about
why
he
went
into
the
river,
saying
that
he
had
gone
in
the
river
in
order
to
collect
the
insurance
to
kill
his
wife
and
then
to
collect
the
insurance.
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
they
did,
your
honor.
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
it
certainly
amplified
motive
and
it
supplied
this
confession,
this
last
confession
was
the
one
used
and
relied
upon
most
heavily
by
the
state
in
the
trial.
it
was
the
first
one
introduced
and
it
was
referred
to
repeatedly
in
the
final
argument.
one
purpose
obviously
that
they
used
this
last
confession
was
because
the
state
was
going
for
the
death
penalty
and
in
the
course
of
this
confession
to
officer
langford,
the
petitioner
had
commented
to
langford
who
supposedly
was
being
held
or
being
involved
in
a
murder
with
a
white
man
or
actually
a
chinese
man
was
his
fake
story.
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
petitioner
had
said,
i
am
being
held
for
allegedly
killing
a
black
man
and
they
do
not
care
for
the
black
man
and
this
was
the
theme
of
the
final
argument
was,
we
wanted
to
prove
that
it
is
a
serious
to
kill
a
black
man
in
the
state
than
it
is
to
kill
a
white
man,
and
therefore,
that
was
the
premise
on
which
the
state
was
asking
for
the
death
penalty.
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
there
were
details
--
coloration
in
details.
there
was
much
more
rapid
descriptions
than
the
formal
language
that
had
been
written
out.
now,
i
have
not
heard
frankly
the
tape
that
was
recorded
so
i
do
not
know
how
i
could
compare
what
was
on
the
tape
with
what
officer
langford
said.
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
i
can
speculate
on
that,
but
i
cannot
say
that
there
is
anything
in
the
record,
your
honor
that
--
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
the
inference
is
that
the
state
was
worried
that
the
confessions
that
it
had
extracted
on
the
11th
and
12th
would
be
held
inadmissible
because
of
the
description
of
the
events
that
i
have
just
described,
they
were
afraid
that
they
would
be
deemed
to
be
coerced
confession.
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
because
of
the
circumstances,
because
he
had
been
held
incommunicado,
because
he
had
been
cutoff
from
getting
a
lawyer
during
this
period
of
time.
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
i
am
not
sure
that
i
follow
your
honor’s
question.
of
course
neither
massiah
nor
escobedo
had
been
rendered
at
this
time.
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
all
pre.
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
that
is
correct.
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
your
honor,
no
court
and
its
significant
that
no
court
has
ever
looked
at
the
totality
of
the
situation
involving
this
petition.
his
appeal
was
taken,
but
he
escaped
pending
his
appeal
and
that
appeal
was
dismissed
without
opinion
and
without
review
of
the
record.
he
then
applied
for
certiorari
to
the
florida
supreme
court
and
that
was
denied
without
opinion.
he
then
filed
a
series
of
collateral
attacks,
but
none
of
these
presented
the
total
situation
before
the
court
and
the
total
situation
here
is
that
the
sixth
amendment
violation,
that
is
the
violation
of
the
right
to
counsel
begun
from
the
very
day
that
he
was
taken
into
custody
in
june
1
and
continue
right
through
this
july
interrogation,
this
officer
langford
interrogation
and
that
seems
to
me
to
be
the
most
--
the
fact
that
stands
out
in
this
case
is
that
here
is
a
man
who
was
blocked
from
having
any
legal
aid
and
he
needed
it
desperately
until
after
these
confessions
of
the
11th
and
12th
were
extracted.
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
absolutely,
your
honor.
we
certainly
contend,
even
if
you
were
to
take
the
extreme
position
which
i
submit
would
be
an
extreme
position,
that
the
legality
of
this
custody
could
be
judged
only
by
decisions
rendered
by
this
court
at
the
time
that
his
conviction
became
final
that
even
under
those
standards,
his
conviction
cannot
stand.
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
your
honor,
he
was
--
he
filed
this
petition
for
habeas
corpus
in
the
federal
district
court
in
miami
and
counsel
was
appointed
for
him
and
the
court
considered
both
and
rule,
both
on
the
voluntariness
of
this
confession
and
also
on
the
question
of
whether
massiah
was
retroactive
or
not,
but
counsel,
his
appointed
counsel
argued
primarily
the
retroactivity
question.
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
this
is
in
the
federal
district
court.
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
i
cannot
answer
that
question,
your
honor
because
it
does
not
appear.
the
only
opinion
that
discusses
the
merits
of
this
case
is
a
habeas
corpus
case
in
the
florida
supreme
court
state
v.
cochran.
all
the
others
are
per
curiam
without
opinion,
so
that
--
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
yes,
he
did
your
honor.
he
appealed.
that
appeal
was
dismissed.
he
applied
for
certiorari
that
was
denied.
he
then
filed
a
series
of
habeas
corpus
in
rule
1
which
is
a
--
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
in
those
proceedings,
your
honor,
so
far
as
i
can
tell
from
the
record,
he
would
attack
one
of
this
confessions
but
not
the
entire,
the
total
picture.
in
other
words,
as
far
as
i
can
tell
in
state
v.
cochran,
he
attacked
the
voluntariness
of
the
first
four
confessions,
these
ones
on
june
11
to
june
12.
in
the
later
collateral
attack
in
the
florida
court,
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
he
attacked
the
admissibility
of
this
july
confession
as
being
involuntary,
although
i
cannot
say
categorically
that
that
is
so
because
the
opinions
do
not
shed
any
light.
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
petition
that
he
filed
in
the
federal
court
below
in
this
case
squarely
attacked
his
july
12
confession
and
that
the
principal
argument
of
counsel
was
that
it
was
inadmissible
because
of
massiah
and
that
massiah
should
be
(inaudible)
normal
application.
now
--
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
your
honor,
i
stated
in
my
brief
that
i
could
not
say
candidly
that
the
petition
in
the
lower
court
presented
as
a
matter
of
pleading
or
as
a
matter
of
argument
the
validity
of
these
first
four
confessions.
however,
the
evidence
before
the
judge
in
which
was
the
state's
prior
transcript
did
contain
all
of
this
information
and
we
do
submit
that
it
is
relevant
in
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
that
you
cannot
simply
savor
this
case
into
independent
blocks
and
that
the
confession
that
was
extracted
in
july
by
the
use
of
officer
langford
was
merely
a
continuation
of
a
post
scheme
of
depriving
this
man
of
his
right
to
counsel.
but
even
if
you
look
and
address
yourself
only
to
this
confession
that
was
extracted
in
july,
we
say
first
of
all
that
thoroughly
there
is
no
way
to
distinguish
what
the
state
did
in
that
case
from
what
was
held
in
messiah
to
be
impermissible.
here
is
a
man
who
is
indicted
on
the
most
serious
charge
of
all,
involving
a
capital
offense
and
he
had
a
lawyer
and
(inaudible).
the
state
seeks
to
go
around
the
lawyer
and
extract
a
confession
from
the
accused
in
a
way
which
obviously
it
could
not
have
done
if
he
had
been
--
if
he
had
the
benefit
of
counsel
present,
if
there
had
been
notice.
now,
the
real
question
is
whether
that
case,
the
massiah
case
should
be
given
the
normal,
usual
application
or
whether
it
should
be
limited
by
what
we
say
is
a
comparatively
new
doctrine,
the
doctrine
of
non-retroactivity.
now,
this
doctrine
is
new
in
the
sense
that
up
until
the
linkletter
case
in
1965,
no
decision
of
this
court
overruling
a
prior
decision
based
on
the
constitution,
interpreting
the
constitution
had
ever
been
limited
to
prospective
effect
only
or
given
less
than
the
total
effect
that
normal
decisions
have.
now,
the
doctrine
of
the
linkletter
doctrine,
the
doctrine
of
non-retroactivity
of
course
has
roots
going
back
to
the
sandburg
(ph)
case
of
mr.
justice
cardozo
which
held
that
a
state
court,
montana
court
could
give
only
prospective
effect
to
a
decision
in
a
civil
case
without
violating
the
due
process
clause
and
certainly
it
is
now
settled
by
this
court.
if
there
is
no
constitutional
impediment
to
giving
a
new
decision
of
this
court,
a
new
decision,
only
prospective
effect
or
limited
prospective
effect
and
we
do
not
propose
the
challenge
that
contention,
but
we
do
say
that
one,
the
doctrine
of
non-retroactivity
is
a
new
one.
secondly,
that
there
are
obvious
disadvantages
to
it
as
well
as
advantages
and
these
have
been
discussed
at
length
by
mr.
justice
lignose
(ph)
and
justice
black,
the
late
mr.
justice
harlan
and
mr.
justice
douglas
who
had
dissented
consistently
from
the
application
of
this
doctrine.
now,
what
are
the
disadvantages?
one
is
obvious
and
that
is
that
it
produces
and
apparent
inequality
right
away.
in
other
words,
as
professor
courier
(ph)
in
his
article
in
51
virginia
law
review
cited
in
the
williams
case
posed
it,
the
prospect
of
two
man
involved
in
the
same
crime
in
the
same
cell
and
one
of
them
simply
by
the
chance
that
this
case
was
tried
earlier
gets
the
benefit
of
a
new
constitutional
ruling
and
goes
out
whereas
the
other
man
at
the
same
time
that
he
is,
the
first
man
is
freed
on
habeas
corpus,
the
other
man
is
lead
down
to
the
gas
chamber
and
this
inequality,
this
surface
inequality
certainly
is
something
that
causes
people
to
pause.
there
is
also
the
fact
that
if
the
logic
of
the
non-retroactivity
doctrine
were
followed
completely
that
we
would
have
merely
an
advisory
opinion
or
law
dictum,
but
the
most
important
reason
for
not
applying
that
we
submit
is
that
the
doctrine
itself
has
the
potential
of
doing
serious
damage
to
the
image
of
this
court
in
that
the
power
of
this
court
from
marbury
versus
madison
has
been
the
respect
of
the
people
for
this
court
as
the
final
expounder
of
a
constitution
as
the
court
that
does
not
make
law
and
when
the
court
acts
like
a
legislature
and
limits
its
opinion
only
to
prospective
effect,
the
court
then
is
subject
to
the
charge
well-founded
or
not,
of
legislating
like
a
court,
like
a
legislature
rather
than
interpreting
and
applying
the
constitution
as
the
court.
and
so
we
submit
for
this
reason
the
doctrine
should
not
be
applied
unless
there
is
a
sudden
new
change
in
the
law
and
massiah
we
say
was
not
a
sudden
new
change.
massiah,
as
the
opinion
itself
states,
stemmed
from
powell
v.
alabama.
it
was
expressly
anticipated
by
spano
versus
new
york
and
the
spano
case
as
i
pointed
at
the
very
beginning
came
down
before
the
conviction
in
this
case
was
final.
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
i
think
he
did.
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
no.
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
that
is
what
--
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
that
is
correct.
i
think
there
--
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
there
was
a
confusion
between
the
fifth
and
the
sixth
amendment
and
we
say
of
course
that
this
was
even
if
you
examine
this
confession
only
by
fifth
amendment
standard
that
it
was
not
a
voluntary
(voice
overlap)
that
is
the
second
point
and
i
certainly
will
leave
that
to
my
brief.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
no,
your
honor.
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
on
review
of
a
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
which
affirmed
a
denial
of
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
which
was
challenging
a
conviction
of
first-degree
murder
in
the
state
courts
of
florida.
the
first-degree
murder
conviction
occurred
in
1958
and
became
final,
that
is
in
the
sense,
that
the
appeal
procedures
were
completed
and
the
time
expired
for
petition
of
certiorari
in
this
court
in
1960
after,
i
mention
that
fact
because
this
is
after
of
course
the
decision
of
this
court
in
spano
versus
new
york,
a
1959
decision
which
occurred
after
the
conviction
of
the
trial
court
before
that
conviction
became
final.
the
facts
involving
the
alleged
crime
itself
are
fairly
simple.
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
the
defendant
in
the
state
trial
court
was
a
black
man
from
mississippi.
he
had
completed
less
than
six
years
of
schooling
in
the
mississippi
schools.
he
was
age
23
at
the
time
of
his
conviction.
he
was
working
as
a
porter
in
a
miami
beach
hotel
and
he
was
living
in
the
black
ghetto
section
of
miami
with
his
common-law-wife
who
was
at
that
time
pregnant.
on
the
evening
of
may
31,
after
he
got
off
work,
he
purchased
a
cheap
used
car
for
approximately
a
$100.00
and
then
that
evening
he
took
his
wife
out
for
a
joy
ride
which
ran
through
the
evening
and
apparently
there
was
some
drinking
during
the
course
of
that
evening
in
the
ride
in
the
new
car.
in
the
early
morning
hours
of
june
1,
that
is
about
2
or
3
a.m.,
he
ran
the
car
into
the
miami
river
and
his
wife
was
drowned.
the
petitioner
himself
barely
escaped
with
his
life.
he
was
fished
out
of
the
miami
river
by
a
boat
captain
and
he
was
incoherent
and
he
injured.
he
was
prostrate
on
the
bank
of
the
river
when
the
police
came
and
the
police
took
him
to
the
dade
county
hospital
where
he
was
admitted
to
the
colored
section,
the
hospital
at
that
time
being
segregated,
and
he
was
held
there
overnight
and
then
the
next
day,
he
was
taken
to
the
city
jail.
no
charge
was
made
against
him
and
he
was
placed
in
the
city
jail
in
a
cell
3
feet
or
4
feet
x
6
feet
in
dimensions
with
no
windows
and
with
a
solid
door.
there
was
electric
light
in
the
cell
which
at
times
would
be
turned
on
and
other
times
he
would
be
in
complete
darkness
and
he
was
held
incommunicado
in
that
box
of
the
cell
for
16
days.
during
that
time,
he
was
taken
out
from
time
to
time
for
interrogation.
he
was
put
in
that
cell
on
june
2.
on
june
3,
he
was
taken
out
early
in
the
morning
about
6
a.m.
and
was
taken
by
a
detective
to
a
room
where
a
medical
doctor,
a
psychiatrist
and
a
ph.
d.
psychologist
administered
truth
serum
to
him,
shoot
in
the
arm
with
a
truth
serum,
he
was
then
questioned.
of
course
he
had
no
lawyer,
he
had
no
friends,
and
he
was
not
allowed
to
make
any
telephone
calls.
he
asked
to
call
his
wife’s
family,
but
he
was
not
allowed
to
communicate
in
any
way
with
the
outside
world.
after
the
session
with
the
doctors
and
under
the
truth
serum
he
was
then
the
next
day
taken
out
and
hooked
up
the
wires
to
use
his
words
and
administered
a
polygraph
test.
and
then
the
day
following
that,
he
was
again
questioned
at
which
time
an
alleged
consent
to
search
his
rooming
his
quarters
were
extracted
from
him
and
pursuant
to
that
alleged
consent,
the
detectives
and
the
medical
examiner
of
the
county
searched
his
quarters.
he
was
questioned
again
at
various
times,
he
says
almost
daily,
for
long
periods,
up
until
june
11,
at
which
time
he
was
taken
from
his
cell
at
about
5
p.m.,
and
was
not
returned
to
the
cell
until
about
1
a.m.
the
following
morning
and
during
that
time
from
5
p.m.
of
june
11
until
the
early
morning
hours
of
june
12,
two
confessions
were
extracted
from
him.
he
claims
and
the
evidence,
of
course
he
is
in
dispute
on
this,
he
claims
that
he
was
subjected
to
threats
and
coercion
that
the
detectives
threatened
to
take
him
for
a
ride
out
in
the
country
and
so
forth
at
that
time
and
that
he
had
no
choice
ultimately,
but
to
agree
to
confess
that
he
had
driven
into
the
river
deliberately
in
order
to
murder
his
wife,
the
motive
being
to
collect
insurance
on
her
life
and
it
is
true
that
he
had
an
insurance
policy.
actually,
it
was
a
policy
that
covered
both
him
and
his
wife.
it
covered
healthcare
and
it
was
an
accidental
death
policy.
it
is
one
of
these
policies
that
is
commonly
sold
in
the
black
ghetto
where
the
collector
comes
around
every
week
and
it
is
very
expensive
insurance
actually,
but
you
pay
your
premiums
in
cash
each
week.
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
a
relatively
short
time.
i
think
the
policy
had
been
in
effect
only
several
months.
i
am
not
sure
that
the
precise
date
that
the
policy
was
taken
out
appears
in
the
record,
but
there
is
some
evidence
from
which
you
could
conclude
that
he
originally
had
one
kind
of
policy
and
then
he
changed
it
comparatively
short
time
before
this
incident.
during
this
session
on
june
11,
he
was
questioned
in
extensive
by
two
detectives,
detective
holmes
(ph)
and
detective
mcclure
(ph)
and
they
resorted
to
the
rather
customary
technique
of
tandem
questioning
that
is
one
man
would
question
while
the
other
one
is
in
a
secret
room
adjoining
from
which
he
could
observe
through
a
one-way
mirror
what
was
going
on
and
of
course
unbeknown
to
him
the
room
was
wired
so
that
whatever
he
said
in
there
would
be
recorded.
the
man
in
the
secret
room
behind
the
one-way
mirror
could
turn
on
the
recording
device
and
record
what
was
said.
the
detective
testified
that
he
had
only
one
hour
of
tape
and
so
out
of
the
entire
time
from
5
p.m.
until
1
a.m.
that
he
was
out
of
his
cell,
only
one
hour
was
put
on
tape
and
the
tape
begins
at
a
point
where
the
petitioner
was
saying
that
he
wanted
to
confess
and
that
he
proposed
a
little
charade
where
he
would
go
out
of
the
room
and
then
knock
on
the
door
and
come
in
and
say,
i
am
appearing
here
voluntarily
to
confess
and
that
it
was
stated
that
he
had
asked
that
this
little
charade
be
gone
through
in
order
to
demonstrate
that
he
was
doing
this
voluntarily
and
freely.
he
says
that
he
would
had
been
coerced
into
doing
this
and
once
he
decided
he
had
to
confess
why
he
wanted
to
get
whatever
benefit
he
could
from
it.
in
any
event,
it
was
only
after
they
had
extracted
these
confessions
on
june
11
that
and
then
the
next
day
on
the
12th,
they
took
him
down
to
the
scene
of
the
incident
and
took
photographs
of
him
that
was
in
the
sense
the
third
confession,
the
first
one
was
on
tape,
the
second
was
a
transcribe,
a
secretary
typed
up
confession
which
he
signed.
the
third
was
this
incident
on
the
12th
when
he
was
taken
to
the
scene
and
then
again
on
the
afternoon
of
the
12th
he
asked
to
change
his
statement
and
a
fourth
confession
was
typed
up
which
he
signed.
only
after
that
was
an
attempt
made
to
arrest
him
for
any
specific
crime.
after
these
confessions
were
extracted,
the
detective
went
down
to
the
magistrate
and
swore
out
a
warrant
for
his
arrest
for
first-degree
murder.
this
resulted
in
his
being
transferred
from
the
city
jail
to
the
county
jail
and
then
in
the
county
jail,
he
was
allowed
finally
to
make
a
telephone
call.
he
called
out
and
obtained
a
lawyer
immediately,
but
even
though
he
had
been
arrested
and
changed
to
the
county
jail,
he
still
was
not
brought
before
any
committee
magistrate
and
the
attorney
that
he
was
able
to
contact
by
making
a
telephone
call
on
june
19
filed
a
habeas
corpus
petition
which
resulted
in
a
preliminary
hearing
and
at
that
time
he
was
brought
finally
before
a
magistrate
and
was
committed
over
to
the
grand
jury
and
the
grand
jury
indicted
him
for
first-degree
murder
on
july
1,
1958.
he
was
not
able
to
post
bail
and
so
he
was
held
in
the
county
jail
pending
his
trial
which
occurred
in
december
of
1958.
on
july
18,
the
state
for
some
reason,
unexplained,
feeling
that
it
needed
more
information
from
him,
knowing
that
he
was
represented
by
counsel,
knowing
that
he
had
been
indicted
decided
that
the
way
to
obtain
this
information
was
not
in
a
straightforward
way
by
either
approaching
his
counsel
or
even
by
as
calling
him
in
and
seeing
if
he
would
voluntarily
answer
questions.
instead,
they
resorted
to
the
technique
of
taking
a
negro
police
officer
and
dressing
him
in
civilian
clothes
and
having
him
pose
as
a
fellow
prisoner
and
one
who
supposedly
was
in
jail
being
held
also
on
a
charge
of
murder.
and
this
police
officer
whose
name
is
archie
langford
entered
petitioner’s
cell
on
july
18
at
about
4
or
5
p.m.
and
then
stayed
in
that
cell
continuously
with
him
except
for
one
brief
moment
when
he
was
taken
out
shortly
after
he
entered
the
cell
on
that
friday,
july
18
evening.
other
than
that
short
time
of
less
than
five
minutes
when
he
was
taken
from
the
cell,
officer
langford
was
in
the
cell
continuously
for
45
--
approximately
45
hours
from
4
to
5
p.m.
on
friday,
i
mean,
excuse
me,
from
7
to
8
p.m.
on
friday
until
4
to
5
p.m.
on
the
following
sunday.
the
testimony
of
officer
langford
is
clear
that
he
was
trying
to
extract
information.
he
went
into
the
cell
with
instructions
to
get
information
from
the
petitioner
and
he
tried
to
get
petitioner
to
talk
about
his
case.
petitioner
refused.
petitioner
told
him
that
he
had
been
instructed
by
his
lawyer
not
to
talk
about
his
case
and
he
repeatedly,
over
and
over
and
over
again,
said
i
do
not
want
to
talk
about
the
case.
he
did
not
talk
about
the
case
that
friday
even
though
that
friday
evening
he
was
woken
up
out
his
sleep
by
the
officer
and
still
refused
to,
the
following
morning
he
refused
to
talk
about
his
case.
it
was
not
until
approximately
noon
the
following
day
that
the
officer
by
use
of
rather
clever
and
adroit
psychological
techniques
was
able
to
get
the
petitioner
to
start
talking
in
little
bits
and
phrases
about
the
case
and
then
it
really
was
not
until
in
the
wee
small
hours
of
sunday
morning
that
as
officer
langford
describes
it
himself,
the
petitioner
broke
down
under
this
continuous
pressure
and
told,
as
officer
langford
states
it,
the
full
story
about
why
he
went
into
the
river,
saying
that
he
had
gone
in
the
river
in
order
to
collect
the
insurance
to
kill
his
wife
and
then
to
collect
the
insurance.
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
they
did,
your
honor.
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
it
certainly
amplified
motive
and
it
supplied
this
confession,
this
last
confession
was
the
one
used
and
relied
upon
most
heavily
by
the
state
in
the
trial.
it
was
the
first
one
introduced
and
it
was
referred
to
repeatedly
in
the
final
argument.
one
purpose
obviously
that
they
used
this
last
confession
was
because
the
state
was
going
for
the
death
penalty
and
in
the
course
of
this
confession
to
officer
langford,
the
petitioner
had
commented
to
langford
who
supposedly
was
being
held
or
being
involved
in
a
murder
with
a
white
man
or
actually
a
chinese
man
was
his
fake
story.
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
petitioner
had
said,
i
am
being
held
for
allegedly
killing
a
black
man
and
they
do
not
care
for
the
black
man
and
this
was
the
theme
of
the
final
argument
was,
we
wanted
to
prove
that
it
is
a
serious
to
kill
a
black
man
in
the
state
than
it
is
to
kill
a
white
man,
and
therefore,
that
was
the
premise
on
which
the
state
was
asking
for
the
death
penalty.
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
there
were
details
--
coloration
in
details.
there
was
much
more
rapid
descriptions
than
the
formal
language
that
had
been
written
out.
now,
i
have
not
heard
frankly
the
tape
that
was
recorded
so
i
do
not
know
how
i
could
compare
what
was
on
the
tape
with
what
officer
langford
said.
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
i
can
speculate
on
that,
but
i
cannot
say
that
there
is
anything
in
the
record,
your
honor
that
--
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
the
inference
is
that
the
state
was
worried
that
the
confessions
that
it
had
extracted
on
the
11th
and
12th
would
be
held
inadmissible
because
of
the
description
of
the
events
that
i
have
just
described,
they
were
afraid
that
they
would
be
deemed
to
be
coerced
confession.
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
because
of
the
circumstances,
because
he
had
been
held
incommunicado,
because
he
had
been
cutoff
from
getting
a
lawyer
during
this
period
of
time.
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
i
am
not
sure
that
i
follow
your
honor’s
question.
of
course
neither
massiah
nor
escobedo
had
been
rendered
at
this
time.
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
all
pre.
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
that
is
correct.
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
your
honor,
no
court
and
its
significant
that
no
court
has
ever
looked
at
the
totality
of
the
situation
involving
this
petition.
his
appeal
was
taken,
but
he
escaped
pending
his
appeal
and
that
appeal
was
dismissed
without
opinion
and
without
review
of
the
record.
he
then
applied
for
certiorari
to
the
florida
supreme
court
and
that
was
denied
without
opinion.
he
then
filed
a
series
of
collateral
attacks,
but
none
of
these
presented
the
total
situation
before
the
court
and
the
total
situation
here
is
that
the
sixth
amendment
violation,
that
is
the
violation
of
the
right
to
counsel
begun
from
the
very
day
that
he
was
taken
into
custody
in
june
1
and
continue
right
through
this
july
interrogation,
this
officer
langford
interrogation
and
that
seems
to
me
to
be
the
most
--
the
fact
that
stands
out
in
this
case
is
that
here
is
a
man
who
was
blocked
from
having
any
legal
aid
and
he
needed
it
desperately
until
after
these
confessions
of
the
11th
and
12th
were
extracted.
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
absolutely,
your
honor.
we
certainly
contend,
even
if
you
were
to
take
the
extreme
position
which
i
submit
would
be
an
extreme
position,
that
the
legality
of
this
custody
could
be
judged
only
by
decisions
rendered
by
this
court
at
the
time
that
his
conviction
became
final
that
even
under
those
standards,
his
conviction
cannot
stand.
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
your
honor,
he
was
--
he
filed
this
petition
for
habeas
corpus
in
the
federal
district
court
in
miami
and
counsel
was
appointed
for
him
and
the
court
considered
both
and
rule,
both
on
the
voluntariness
of
this
confession
and
also
on
the
question
of
whether
massiah
was
retroactive
or
not,
but
counsel,
his
appointed
counsel
argued
primarily
the
retroactivity
question.
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
this
is
in
the
federal
district
court.
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
i
cannot
answer
that
question,
your
honor
because
it
does
not
appear.
the
only
opinion
that
discusses
the
merits
of
this
case
is
a
habeas
corpus
case
in
the
florida
supreme
court
state
v.
cochran.
all
the
others
are
per
curiam
without
opinion,
so
that
--
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
yes,
he
did
your
honor.
he
appealed.
that
appeal
was
dismissed.
he
applied
for
certiorari
that
was
denied.
he
then
filed
a
series
of
habeas
corpus
in
rule
1
which
is
a
--
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
in
those
proceedings,
your
honor,
so
far
as
i
can
tell
from
the
record,
he
would
attack
one
of
this
confessions
but
not
the
entire,
the
total
picture.
in
other
words,
as
far
as
i
can
tell
in
state
v.
cochran,
he
attacked
the
voluntariness
of
the
first
four
confessions,
these
ones
on
june
11
to
june
12.
in
the
later
collateral
attack
in
the
florida
court,
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
he
attacked
the
admissibility
of
this
july
confession
as
being
involuntary,
although
i
cannot
say
categorically
that
that
is
so
because
the
opinions
do
not
shed
any
light.
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
petition
that
he
filed
in
the
federal
court
below
in
this
case
squarely
attacked
his
july
12
confession
and
that
the
principal
argument
of
counsel
was
that
it
was
inadmissible
because
of
massiah
and
that
massiah
should
be
(inaudible)
normal
application.
now
--
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
your
honor,
i
stated
in
my
brief
that
i
could
not
say
candidly
that
the
petition
in
the
lower
court
presented
as
a
matter
of
pleading
or
as
a
matter
of
argument
the
validity
of
these
first
four
confessions.
however,
the
evidence
before
the
judge
in
which
was
the
state's
prior
transcript
did
contain
all
of
this
information
and
we
do
submit
that
it
is
relevant
in
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
that
you
cannot
simply
savor
this
case
into
independent
blocks
and
that
the
confession
that
was
extracted
in
july
by
the
use
of
officer
langford
was
merely
a
continuation
of
a
post
scheme
of
depriving
this
man
of
his
right
to
counsel.
but
even
if
you
look
and
address
yourself
only
to
this
confession
that
was
extracted
in
july,
we
say
first
of
all
that
thoroughly
there
is
no
way
to
distinguish
what
the
state
did
in
that
case
from
what
was
held
in
messiah
to
be
impermissible.
here
is
a
man
who
is
indicted
on
the
most
serious
charge
of
all,
involving
a
capital
offense
and
he
had
a
lawyer
and
(inaudible).
the
state
seeks
to
go
around
the
lawyer
and
extract
a
confession
from
the
accused
in
a
way
which
obviously
it
could
not
have
done
if
he
had
been
--
if
he
had
the
benefit
of
counsel
present,
if
there
had
been
notice.
now,
the
real
question
is
whether
that
case,
the
massiah
case
should
be
given
the
normal,
usual
application
or
whether
it
should
be
limited
by
what
we
say
is
a
comparatively
new
doctrine,
the
doctrine
of
non-retroactivity.
now,
this
doctrine
is
new
in
the
sense
that
up
until
the
linkletter
case
in
1965,
no
decision
of
this
court
overruling
a
prior
decision
based
on
the
constitution,
interpreting
the
constitution
had
ever
been
limited
to
prospective
effect
only
or
given
less
than
the
total
effect
that
normal
decisions
have.
now,
the
doctrine
of
the
linkletter
doctrine,
the
doctrine
of
non-retroactivity
of
course
has
roots
going
back
to
the
sandburg
(ph)
case
of
mr.
justice
cardozo
which
held
that
a
state
court,
montana
court
could
give
only
prospective
effect
to
a
decision
in
a
civil
case
without
violating
the
due
process
clause
and
certainly
it
is
now
settled
by
this
court.
if
there
is
no
constitutional
impediment
to
giving
a
new
decision
of
this
court,
a
new
decision,
only
prospective
effect
or
limited
prospective
effect
and
we
do
not
propose
the
challenge
that
contention,
but
we
do
say
that
one,
the
doctrine
of
non-retroactivity
is
a
new
one.
secondly,
that
there
are
obvious
disadvantages
to
it
as
well
as
advantages
and
these
have
been
discussed
at
length
by
mr.
justice
lignose
(ph)
and
justice
black,
the
late
mr.
justice
harlan
and
mr.
justice
douglas
who
had
dissented
consistently
from
the
application
of
this
doctrine.
now,
what
are
the
disadvantages?
one
is
obvious
and
that
is
that
it
produces
and
apparent
inequality
right
away.
in
other
words,
as
professor
courier
(ph)
in
his
article
in
51
virginia
law
review
cited
in
the
williams
case
posed
it,
the
prospect
of
two
man
involved
in
the
same
crime
in
the
same
cell
and
one
of
them
simply
by
the
chance
that
this
case
was
tried
earlier
gets
the
benefit
of
a
new
constitutional
ruling
and
goes
out
whereas
the
other
man
at
the
same
time
that
he
is,
the
first
man
is
freed
on
habeas
corpus,
the
other
man
is
lead
down
to
the
gas
chamber
and
this
inequality,
this
surface
inequality
certainly
is
something
that
causes
people
to
pause.
there
is
also
the
fact
that
if
the
logic
of
the
non-retroactivity
doctrine
were
followed
completely
that
we
would
have
merely
an
advisory
opinion
or
law
dictum,
but
the
most
important
reason
for
not
applying
that
we
submit
is
that
the
doctrine
itself
has
the
potential
of
doing
serious
damage
to
the
image
of
this
court
in
that
the
power
of
this
court
from
marbury
versus
madison
has
been
the
respect
of
the
people
for
this
court
as
the
final
expounder
of
a
constitution
as
the
court
that
does
not
make
law
and
when
the
court
acts
like
a
legislature
and
limits
its
opinion
only
to
prospective
effect,
the
court
then
is
subject
to
the
charge
well-founded
or
not,
of
legislating
like
a
court,
like
a
legislature
rather
than
interpreting
and
applying
the
constitution
as
the
court.
and
so
we
submit
for
this
reason
the
doctrine
should
not
be
applied
unless
there
is
a
sudden
new
change
in
the
law
and
massiah
we
say
was
not
a
sudden
new
change.
massiah,
as
the
opinion
itself
states,
stemmed
from
powell
v.
alabama.
it
was
expressly
anticipated
by
spano
versus
new
york
and
the
spano
case
as
i
pointed
at
the
very
beginning
came
down
before
the
conviction
in
this
case
was
final.
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
i
think
he
did.
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
no.
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
that
is
what
--
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
that
is
correct.
i
think
there
--
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
there
was
a
confusion
between
the
fifth
and
the
sixth
amendment
and
we
say
of
course
that
this
was
even
if
you
examine
this
confession
only
by
fifth
amendment
standard
that
it
was
not
a
voluntary
(voice
overlap)
that
is
the
second
point
and
i
certainly
will
leave
that
to
my
brief.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
no,
your
honor.
mr.
neil
p.
rutledge
thank
you,
your
honor.
