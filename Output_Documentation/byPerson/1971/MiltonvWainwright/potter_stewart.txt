justice
potter
stewart
mr.
rutledge,
at
this
time,
i
think
you,
as
i
understood
you
told
us
the
authorities
already
had
one
or
more
confessions,
did
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
--
but
what
these
confessions
did
was
to
supply
motive,
was
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
but
was
their
--
except
for
that
claim,
was
there
anything
additional
revealed
in
this
prison
confession
to
the
other
officers
that
had
not
been
already
confessed
to?
justice
potter
stewart
and
finally,
is
there
any
indication
on
the
record
or
any
thing
at
the
trial
as
to
why
after
they
had
two
or
three
confessions,
they
felt
a
need
to
get
an
additional
one?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
would
be
the
inference?
justice
potter
stewart
because
of
the
circumstances?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
the
district
judge
in
this
case
quite
misstated
the
doctrine
of
massiah
in
the
-
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
opinion.
he
held
that
confessions
are
involuntary
per
se
if
induced
by
officers
or
agents
from
an
accused
after
his
indictment,
while
he
is
without
assistance
of
counsel
and
then
in
the
powell
case,
it
is
quite
different.
the
powell
case
involved
the
sixth
amendment.
well,
the
fact
is
that
massiah
involved
the
sixth
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
it
did
not
hold
that
confessions
are
involuntary
per
se,
did
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that
interrogation
after
indictment
deliberately
undertaken
by
the
government
was
a
denial
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
of
course
the
court
will
appeal
to
affirm
this
case
based
on
the
district
court’s
opinion.
justice
potter
stewart
that
could
have
been
one.
justice
potter
stewart
they
came
with
new
law.
justice
potter
stewart
was
that
the
matter
that
the
court
of
appeals
never
reached,
is
that
not
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
no,
you
are
not
a
petitioner.
justice
potter
stewart
you
could
do
whatever
you
want
to
support
the
judgment.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
he
is
not
going
to
bring
up
the
point
to
this
harmless
error,
would
he?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
am
talking
about
what
you
are
just
beginning
to
address
yourself
to
the
proposition
that
this
was
harmless
error,
the
admission
of
this
confession
even
if
the
error
was
harmless,
is
that
what
you
are
going
to
say?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
question,
that
is
an
issue
that
the
court
of
appeal
and
the
district
court
did
not
reach,
is
that
not
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
would
you
know
any
–-
justice
potter
stewart
now,
do
you
have
any
precedent
for
that
proposition?
justice
potter
stewart
or
for
the
proposition
that
the
admission
of
--
the
wrongful
admission,
the
erroneous
admission
of
any
extrajudicial
confession
can
ever
be
harmless
error?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
not
an
extrajudicial
confession.
justice
potter
stewart
my
question
is
do
you
know
of
any
case
in
this
court
that
has
held
that
the
admission
in
violation
of
the
constitution
of
an
extrajudicial
confession
could
ever
be
harmless
error?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
know
of
any?
justice
potter
stewart
did
it
get
compared
as
to
the
massiah
case?
justice
potter
stewart
which
it
did
not
have
anything
to
do
with
whether
or
not
a
confession
was
(inaudible)?
justice
potter
stewart
quite
contrary
to
what
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
my
question
is,
do
you
think
that
this
comes
within
the
massiah
case,
quite
apart
from
whether
massiah
is
retroactive,
that
after
all
is
the
basic
issue
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
you
know
the
mcleod
case
from
ohio?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i
am
just
taking
about
your
claim
that
massiah
should
not
be
extended
beyond
its
own
facts.
it
has
been
extended
at
least
to
the
facts
of
the
mcleod
case,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
beyond
massiah
and
mcleod?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
know
what
the
facts
were
in
the
mcleod
case?
justice
potter
stewart
has
massiah
overruled
any
previous
decision?
as
mapp
did
and
which
would
--
you
have
mentioned
linkletter,
but
did
massiah?
justice
potter
stewart
it
has
to
do
with
reliance?
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
has
been
indicted?
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
has
a
lawyer?
justice
potter
stewart
how
common
do
you
think
--
how
common
a
practice
of
this
do
you
suppose
before
massiah?
justice
potter
stewart
going
out
to
your
point
as
to
the
strain
on
the
judicial
system?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
and
after
the
man
has
been
indicted
and
after
he
has
a
lawyer,
will
the
government
deliberately
to
get
at
him
and
interrogate
him
further?
justice
potter
stewart
i
ask
this
only
because
i
just
rely
on
my
own
recollection.
i
do
not
remember
that
since
the
trial,
we
had
a
single
--
that
this
question
has
arisen
here.
justice
potter
stewart
the
retroactively
of
massiah
and
that
is
the
reason
that
suggest
to
me
that
this
is
a
very
rare
practice
i
would
hope?
justice
potter
stewart
i
like
to
change
the
story,
let
us
say,
they
denied
the
right
to
guarantee
by
powell
against
alabama
or
by
gideon
against
wainwright?
justice
potter
stewart
the
record
would
show
that,
would
it
not
at
the
trial
whether
or
not
a
policeman
interrogated
an
end,
after
he
had
been
indicted
and
after
a
lawyer,
after
he
had
a
lawyer
and
then
further
testified
at
that
man’s
trial
on
behalf
of
prosecution
and
the
record
will
show
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
if
there
is
any
cross-examination
at
all
with
prosecution
witness
it
would
have
been
brought
out
in
circumstances
under
which
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
facts
would
be
in
the
record?
