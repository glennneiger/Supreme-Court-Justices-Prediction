letter
in

to
mr.

that
philadelphia
had
offered
him
a
contract,
what

i
just
wanted
to
ask
to
you,
but
you
are
now
telling
us
about
the
lack
of
mootness
and
about
his
damages
in
1970
he
was
moved
off

does
the

anything

justice

there
are
many
nlrb
proceedings
involving
the
relationships
between
the
clubs
and
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
merits
of
the
controversy
were
never
reached
either
in
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals.
they
declined
it
--
both
courts
declined
to
reason
the
merits
because
they
held
that
organized
baseball
is
not
subject
to
the
--
neither
the
federal
or
the
state
antitrust
laws
and
it's
that
issue
that's
now
before
this
court
is
it
not?
and
if
we
should
decide
that
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
were
wrong
in
that
view,
then
the
normal
practice
be
for
this
court
to
remand
the
case
to
the
district
court
for
trial
of
the
case
on
the
merits.

well
that's

that
just

that

your
argument

gather
that
this
is
not
a
matter
for
the
