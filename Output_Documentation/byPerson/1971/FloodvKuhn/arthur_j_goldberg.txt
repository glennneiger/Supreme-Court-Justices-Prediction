mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
the
legality
under
federal
antitrust
and
state
statutory
and
commonwealth
organized
baseballs
through
reserved
system.
to
paraphrase
judge
waterman's
opinion
in
the
court
of
appeals,
this
is
a
scheme
which
binds
every
american
professional
baseball
player
to
one
team
or
it's
assignee
for
life.
and
which
compels
team
owners
to
boycott
the
player
or
property
of
another
team
owner,
and
to
boycott
any
fellow
owner,
and
to
boycott
the
player
himself
and
blacklist
him,
who
fails
to
abide
by
the
agreement
among
the
owners
to
eliminate
competition
in
recruitment
and
retention
of
personnel.
the
reach
of
the
reserve
system
extends
beyond
the
continental
united
states
and
even
our
new
states.
beyond
the
24
major
league
clubs
which
are
defendants
in
this
law
suit,
to
155
minor
league
clubs
organized
in
21
minor
leagues,
to
the
mexican
league
and
even
to
japan.
an
american
player
boycotted
by
organized
baseball
today
is
boycotted
by
japanese
employers
as
well.
perhaps
it
maybe
helpful
to
the
court,
if
i
having
stated
the
issue
now
review
a
few
of
the
pertinent
facts.
on
october
8,
1969
curtis
c.
flood
then
a
major
professional
ball
player
for
the
st.
louis
cardinals
was
traded,
his
contract
transferred
and
assigned
to
another
national
league
baseball
club,
the
philadelphia
phillies
as
part
of
the
multi-player
transaction
between
the
two
clubs.
as
judge
cooper
found
in
the
district
court
and
i
paraphrase
him
at
the
time
of
the
trade,
he
was
22
years
old,
a
veteran
of
12
years
of
service
with
the
cardinals.
co-captain
of
the
team
by
the
election
of
his
teammates.
and
acknowledged
to
be
a
player
of
exceptional
and
proven
ability.
about
that
the
record
is
very
clear,
in
his
active
service
with
the
st.
louis
cardinals,
he
batted
around
300,
won
several
golden
gloves
competition,
which
is
the
competition
for
excellent
fielding.
and
was
regarded
to
be
a
great
asset
for
that
team,
and
as
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
he
was
being
paid
$90,000
a
year.
not
a
salary
as
we
know
from
reading
the
newspapers
that
baseball
owners
throw
away
very
lightly.
the
circumstances
surrounding
his
assignment
or
as
judge
waterman
said
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
use
baseball
(inaudible)
sale
are
rather
interesting
as
part
of
the
background
of
this
litigation.
now
perhaps
that
explains
why
he
chose
to
use
the
courts
to
vindicate
his
rights,
although
he
had
deep
routes
in
st.
louis
missouri,
not
only
with
the
ball
club
which
he
had
served
faithfully
for
12
years.
he
was
also
an
artist
who
had
an
artist
studio.
he
had
two
photographic
studios
and
franchises
else
where.
and
he
had
many
friends
and
family
in
st.
louis.
he
was
not
consulted
about
the
training.
at
the
contrary
he
received
a
form
notice
and
then
a
telephone
call.
the
form
notice
was
a
very
cryptic
one.
record
itself
does
not
really
display
what
it
actually
is,
it's
a
printed
form.
and
in
that
printed
form,
there
is
a
checkbox.
your
contract
is
renewed,
your
contract
code
has
been
transferred,
you
have
been
released
from
the
service.
perhaps,
i
would
like
to
suggest
your
honors
you
might
want
to
look
at
the
exhibits
rather
than
the
cold
record,
to
see
how
this
form
is
filled
out.
i
should
say
at
all
fairness
to
my
distinguished
brothers
on
the
opposite
side,
he
also
received
a
telephone
call.
after
the
transaction
was
completed
not
before
presumably,
he
had
relinquished
all
of
his
rights
to
any
consultation
or
disposition
of
his
destiny.
when
at
the
age
of
15,
he
signed
a
contract
with
the
cincinnati
reds
that
without
the
without
the
assistance
of
an
attorney
which
was
the
practice
in
those
days
and
until
very
recently,
until
the
1970
contract.
he
signed
his
first
professional
baseball
contract
for
an
average
salary
of
$4000,
which
of
course
worked
his
way
up
the
ladder,
but
he
was
playing
last.
he
enjoyed
this
very
generous
salary.
the
fact
that
he
was
an
exceptional
player
as
judge
cooper
found
in
the
district
court
and
judge
waterman
speaking
for
the
court
of
appeals
confirmed
that
finding.
it
was
illustrated
by
his
batting
averages.
after
he
started
to
play
full
time
in
1962
he
had
been
there
since
1958
with
st.
louis
cardinals
his
batting
averages
were
1962
296,
1963
302,
1964
311,
1965
310,
1965
267,
1967
335,
1968
301,
1969
285.
i
am
not
a
great
mathematician
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justices,
but
this
seems
to
me
to
be
a
batting
average
around
300.
he
was
also
the
winner
of
several
golden
gloves
awards.
these
are
awards
given
to
players
for
excellent
in
fielding.
he
got
this
notice,
this
form
notice
without
advance
consultation,
and
he
got
the
telephone
call
telling
him
that
he
had
to
uproot
himself,
his
family,
his
business
connections
and
move
to
philadelphia.
on
december
24,
1969
mr.
flood
wrote
to
the
commissioner
of
baseball,
respondent
to
mr.
bowie
kuhn,
the
commissioner
of
baseball
asserting
his
rights
to
negotiate
with
team
other
than
philadelphia
and
state.
and
it's
a
rather
interesting
exchange,
this
was
his
letter
in
part,
the
relevant
part,
“dear
mr.
khun
after
12
years
in
the
major
leagues,
i
do
not
feel
that
i
am
a
piece
of
property
to
be
brought
and
sold,
irrespective
of
my
wishes.
i
believe
that
any
system
which
produces
that
vital
result
violates
my
basic
rights
as
a
citizen,
and
is
inconsistent
with
the
laws
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
law
of
federal
states.”
the
commissioner
of
baseball
mr.
khun
replied,
dear
curt
this
is
frankly
reminiscent
to
me
of
a
unanimous
decision
of
the
supreme
court,
which
reverse
the
hamilton
case
because
a
witness
was
addressed
by
her
first
name
while
other
witnesses
were
addressed
by
their
last
names.
putting
that
aside
the
letter
read,
“dear
curt,
while
we
agreed
with
the
contention
that
as
a
human
being
you
are
not
a
piece
of
property
to
be
bought
and
sold.
and
this
is
fundamental
to
our
society
and
could
not
see
its
applicability
of
the
situation
on
him.”
faced
with
the
sale
which
he
deemed
to
be
an
impairment
of
his
legal
rights
and
denial
of
his
request
that
he
be
made
a
free
agent
of
liberty
to
seek
employment
with
other
teams
and
without
subjecting
the
new
employer
to
boycott
by
the
team
owners,
he
had
no
recourse
in
his
opinion,
other
than
to
mount
this
law
suit.
and
this
law
suit
challenges
the
reserve
system
which
permits
this
to
be
done.
mr.
flood
adhered
to
his
refusal
to
play
for
philadelphia
during
the
1970
season.
well,
then
philadelphia
sold
its
exclusive
right
to
negotiate
with
flood,
to
the
washington
senators
after
1970
season
concluded,
and
until
the
necessity
compelled
him
to
acquiescence.
so
we
have
the
reserve
system,
not
unfamiliar
to
this
court,
because
this
court
has
passed
upon
it.
i
think
wrongly
in
two
cases
and
particularly
toolson.
i
think
a
very
accurate
description
of
the
reserve
clause
as
contained
both
in
the
district
court
opinion
and
in
judge
waterman's
opinion
for
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
whole
court
of
appeals,
judge
moore
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
judge
waterman
in
the
court
of
appeals
described
the
reserve
system
as
a
system
and
i
quote
him,
“which
pursuant
to
a
nationwide
agreement”
and
i
shall
say
a
word
about
that,
clubs,
baseball
clubs
effectively
restrict
a
baseball
player,
if
he
desires
to
play
professional
baseball
at
all,
contract
negotiations
with
that
club
that
organized
baseball
which
firstly
employs
or
reserves
it,
or
with
that
clubs,
assignee
club.
now
in
the
subsequent
assignee
clubs
to
which
in
the
(inaudible)
and
i
am
quoting
judge
waterman,
“he
has
been
sold
or
traded,
there
is
a
more
expensive
treatment
of
how
the
reserve
system
operates
citing
the
rules
which
govern
the
baseball
rules
in
judge
cooper's
opinion
in
the
district
court.”
now
while
i
disagree
with
his
conclusion,
i
do
not
disagree
that
judge
cooper
correctly
describes
how
the
reserve
system
operates.
briefly,
in
addition
to
judge
waterman's
pungent
and
succinct
description
it
goes
beyond
that.
no
other
club
may
bid
for
his
services,
once
he
signs.
he
is
not
permitted
to
approach
any
other
club.
that's
called
the
no
tampering
rule.
a
club
which
violates
this
rule
is
subject
to
boycott
by
the
other
clubs.
in
fact,
any
player
that
plays
for
another
club
which
violates
this
rule,
is
subject
to
discipline,
by
the
commissioner
of
baseball.
and
it
also
extends
beyond,
judge
waterman
did
not
deal
with
clubs,
the
major
league
clubs
that
extends
the
minor
league
club,
that
extends
to
the
mexican
league,
that
extends
even
to
japan.
this
is
un-contradicted
in
the
record.
now
mr.
flood
stated
out
in
1970
and
pursues
this
law
suit,
challenging
the
reserve
system
on
several
grounds.
first,
that
it
violates
the
antitrust
laws
of
the
united
states,
second
that
it
violates
the
antitrust
laws
and
common
law
of
the
several
states,
and
third
that
it
violates
the
thirteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution,
of
the
united
states
prescribing
that
indentured
service
as
well
as
slavery
should
not
be
permitted.
now,
as
he
stayed
out
in
1970
as
i
have
said,
he
was
confronted
with
1971,
and
at
that
time
philadelphia
the
team
that
owned
him,
again
i
quote,
paraphrased
as
waterman’s
opinion,
“the
team
that
owns
him
sold
him
to
washington.
he
agreed
to
play
for
washington,
he
was
there
for
a
few
months
and
we
can
all
take
judicial
notice,
i
think
of
what
occurred
layman,
lawyers
and
i
believe
this
court,
he
tried,
he
had
been
laid
off
for
a
year.
after
trying
for
a
few
months
in
spring
training
and
in
the
actual
season
he
was
best,
he
could
not
easily
regain
his
skills
which
is
not
difficult
to
understand
and
he
left”.
now,
the
transfer
to
philadelphia,
the
transfer
from
philadelphia
to
washington
was
accompanied
by
stipulations
between
ourselves
and
opposing
counsel
that
this
was
not
connected
to
this
lawsuit.
i
am
well
aware
however
that
private
people
cannot
stipulate
a
case
for
this
court,
but
the
transfer
did
not
moot
this
case
and
radovich,
the
football
case,
this
court
held
that
the
success
of
a
boycott
did
not
moot
the
case
and
furthermore
he
had
experienced
damages
in
1970,
and
he
had
suffered
impairment
of
his
career.
now,
i
turn
to
the
reserve
clause.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
they
offered
him
an
increase
to
a
$100,000
with
salary
and
another
benefits,
but
that
was
not
what
he
was
contesting,
he
was
contesting
being
removed
without
his
consent
and
as
his
letter
states
he
didn't
want
to
be
treated
as
channel
property,
question
of
principle.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
it
is
not
by
the
way
new
although
i
have
seen
articles
about
it
which
indicates
that
this
high
paid
ball
player
did
things
as
you
know
that,
why
did
he
do
it
when
other
ball
players,
by
the
way
despite
of
all
the
stories
in
press
in
the
five
years
previous
had
only
averaged
a
little
over
$8,000
a
year,
why
this
high
paid
ball
player
did
this?
he
did
it
as
he
simply
said,
out
of
principle.
he
no
longer
wanted
to
be
treated
as
channel
property,
he
made
that
decision
on
his
own
and
although
he
has
been
supported
in
this
litigation
by
the
players
association
about
which
i
shall
later
have
reference.
this
was
his
decision,
the
record
is
very
plain
on
that,
in
fact
he
was
told
by
the
director
mr.
miller
that
he
had
a
tough
case,
nevertheless
he
felt
in
good
conscience
he
had
to
presume.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
exactly,
mr.
justice
provided
this
clause
is
legal
and
i
shall
say
it
is
not.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
he
said
that
what
he
wanted,
what
is
the
opportunity
as
a
free
agent
to
negotiate
his
own
deal,
not
to
be
traded
as
this
form
that
i
have
referred,
indicates
without
his
concern.
now
the
reserve
clause
has
been
in
existence
one
hundred
years
long
and
today
any
union
that
the
ball
players
formed,
which
i
shall
talk
about
in
the
labor
exemption,
with
one
important
modification.
in
1965,
the
reserve
system
was
extended
for
the
first
time
to
potential
new
players
who
had
never
signed
an
agreement
with
any
team
and
typically
these
are
teenagers
just
graduated
from
high
school
or
who
have
dropped
out
of
high
school.
this
had
never
been
done.
this
category
not
in
the
minor
leagues
they
until
65
enjoyed
the
privilege
of
negotiating
their
first
contract,
that
no
longer
exist.
they
have
a
semiannual
draft.
there
is
another
factor
which
i
shall
advert
to
when
i
talk
about
the
so
called
labor
exemption.
judge
cooper
found
that
the
baseball’s
reserve
system
is
not
presently,
collectively
agreed
to.
citation
is
in
my
brief,
i
shall
not
burden
you
with
the
citation.
now
when
flood
decided
to
sue,
he
challenges
as
i
have
said
on
several
grounds.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
no.
and
i
shall
discuss
that
when
i
come
to
the
labor
exemption.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
will
move
fast,
because
of
the
shortness
of
time,
we
have
these
three
of
our
positions.
on
the
first
the
anti-trust
laws
we
are
confronted
obviously
with
two
decisions
in
this
court,
federal
baseball
decided
in
1942
and
toolson
decided
in
1953.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
they
would
have
to
overruled,
they
should
be
overruled,
they
should
be
overruled
for
very
good
reasons,
they
should
be
overruled
because
the
first
one
federal
baseball
was
not
as
judge
friendly
has
said,
“justice
holmes
happiest
hour”,
indeed.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes,
but
even
then
it
showed,
i
doubt
that
justice
holmes
had
never
seen
a
ball
game--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes
but
it
has
and
quite
recently
as
i
shall
point
out
in
a
moment
in
reading
throwing
opinion
written
by
justice
stewart
for
a
unanimous
court
in
construing
a
statute.
there
is
a
case
that
put
aside
the
collins
versus
hardyman,
the
federal
baseball
in
fact
was
abandoned
by
justice
holmes
the
very
next
term
--
and
toolson
was
a
percuriam
which
merely
said
that
while
we
have
done
it
even
though
we
think
it’s
wrong
because
interstate
commerce
has
changed,
well,
we
rather
leave
it
to
congress
and
the
court
was
troubled
at
that
time
with
whether
or
not
prospective
rulings
could
be
met,
that
problem
of
course
has
been
settled
by
this
court
even
quite
recently
and
i
shall
mention
that.
now,
i
say
to
you
very
simply,
i
shall
not
be
elaborate
that
federal
baseball
was
wrong.
the
development
of
law
or
what
constitutes
the
commerce
was
considered
the
base
and
no
one
would
doubt
that
baseball
is
engaged
in
the
interstate
commerce.
this
court
in
radovich
this
court
shubert
theaters,
this
court
in
the
boxing
area
have
all
characterized
sports,
if
they
are
so
called
as
in
interstate
commerce
baseball
indeed
is
an
interstate
commerce
in
a
very
big
way.
that
is
a
tremendous
institution
that
sends
people
all
over
the
company
and
in
canada.
it
realizes
enormous
revenues
from
television
i
think
i
saw
the
other
day
that
in
the
national
contract
television
rights,
they
realized
$41
million
and
then
it
supplemented
their
local
contracts.
now
we
have
here
a
question
of
stare
decisis
that
i
thought
that
this
had
been
put
to
rest
involving
a
statute--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
it
depends
on
what
way
labor
is
treated,
labor
should
not
be
an
article
of
commerce.
clayton
act
says
it
should
not
be
a
commodity.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes,
because
he
is
been
treated
as
a
commodity,
as
everybody
is
under
the
reserve
rule.
he
is
not
treated
his
labor
as
we
traditionally
understand
labor
people
to
be
treated,
free
american
workers
determining
their
own
destiny.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes
it
did,
the
same
issue
was
radovich
and
decided
against
the
football
owners
which
brought
radovich,
which
were
involved
in
radovich's
decision
in
this
court.
it
was
argued
in
radovich,
and
i
do
not
know
what
prompted
this
court
to
take
certiorari,
i
had
not
assumed
the
purpose
of
the
grant
and
this
necessarily
follows,
if
it
is
treated
as
a
labor
exemption
which
i
shall
talk
about.
if,
it
is
decided
that
the
labor
exemptions
so
called
applies,
then
that
certainly
applies
to
football
they
have
a
union,
certainly
applies
to
hockey
and
the
consequences
of
a
decision
holding
that
the
labor
exemption
applies
to
baseball
may
necessarily
mean
that
it
applies
to
all
of
the
sports,
so
called
sports.
otherwise
it's
very
interesting
when
you
read
this
record,
as
i
know
you
have
or
will,
bowie
kuhn
the
commissioner
of
baseball
does
not
refer
to
it
as
a
sport.
he
refers
to
it
as
an
entertainment,
as
entertainment
it's
governed
by
your
decision
in
shubert
which
says
that
subject
to
antitrust
regulation.
the
decision
justice
stewart
that
i
mentioned,
in
a
statutory
construction
is
your
own
in
griffin
versus
breckenridge,
perhaps
i
shall
read
only
a
few
sentences.
whether
or
not
collins
versus
hardyman
construes
the
civil
rights
act.
correctly
decided
at
its
own
fact
is
a
question
with
which
we
need
not
here
be
concerned,
but
it
is
clear
in
light
of
the
evolution
of
decisional
law,
that
had
passed
since
the
case
was
decided
that
many
of
the
constitutional
problems
there,
proceeds
simply
do
not
exist.
justice
holmes
conceived
there
was
a
constitutional
problem.
the
only
reasons
remains
therefore
not
to
accord
to
the
words
of
the
statute,
their
apparent
meaning.
i
move
quickly
to
the
next
point.
i
think
that
it
ought
to
be
overruled.
it's
anomaly
in
the
law,
every
common
theater
has
said
it's
anomaly
in
the
law
to
adhere
to
toolson
and
to
federal
baseball
as
improperly
decided.
now
i
move
quickly
to
the
next
point.
and
that
is
state
law,
peculiarly
enough
as
judge
waterman
even
says
they
were
the
we
were
in
the
horns
of
a
dilemma.
the
federal
law
did
not
apply
because
it
was
not
interstate
commerce.
why
should
not
state
law
apply?
judge
waterman
said
contrary
to
the
district
court,
which
said
it
was
preempted
judge
waterman
says
that
it
was
interfering
with
interstate
commerce.
i
take
that
this
has
no
foundation
whatsoever.
the
decisions
of
this
court
are
plenty
and
ample.
well,
the
subject
that
state
laws
were
to
carry
out
for
the
purposes
of
the
great
federal
statutes
for
sherman
act
which
are
not
inconsistent
ought
to
be
applied.
and
then
that
is
the
law.
authoritatively
the
sherman
act
said
that
our
law
is
designed
to
supplement,
not
disgrace
federal
law.
there
is
no
preemption
here,
expressed
or
implied,
there
is
no
conflict
nor
as
any
court
found
one.
judge
waterman
says,
there
is
a
necessity
for
uniformity
or
there
was
no
inquiry
into
the
state
statutes
to
determine
whether
there
was.
we
have
listed
the
state
statutes
and
briefly
summarized,
they
are
the
same
as
the
sherman
act.
those
states
that
have
adopted
it.
so
the
decision,
for
example,
in
the
continental
airlines
case
covers
that.
finally
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
pardon.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes,
he
left
--
he
left
now.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
no,
it's
not
because
the
70
season,
is
the
season
where
he
has
right
to
recover
damages
because
he
returned
later
and
he
also
has
right
to
decide
if
he
wants
to
go
to
minor
leagues,
or
japan
which
are
subjected
to
the
same
rules.
i
will
say
one
word,
i
should
take
a
few
more
minutes
of
my
time
and
comes
off
of
rebuttal.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
about,
yes.
about
the
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
there
is
nothing
too
bad
to
the
baseball
argument
that
a
new
found
affection
for
the
collective
bargaining
and
the
labor
act.
i
share
that
affection,
in
fact,
i
shared
it
for
many,
many
years.
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
this
is
hardcore
violation
of
the
antitrust
law.
this
is
a
group
boycott
and
blacklisting,
all
of
this
under
the
rules
are
obligated
not
to
deal
with
a
player,
if
he
is
on
a
reserve
list,
he
is
blacklisted
not
only
here
but
in
mexico
and
in
japan.
and
this
is
the
most
obvious
restraint
of
trait
known
to
man.
i'll
put
a
simple
illustration.
as
your
honor
is
well
know,
i
once
represented
the
steelworkers.
let
me
put
a
proposition.
suppose
the
steelworkers
union,
they
would
never
do
this,
agreed
with
us
steel,
that
if
a
man
signed
up,
he
had
to
work
for
us
steel
all
his
life
and
if
(inaudible)
employed
him
and
he
left.
if
(inaudible)
employed
him,
us
steel
will
not
supply
parts
for
their
fabricating
or
steel
for
their
fabricating
operations.
is
there
any
doubt
in
anybody's
mind
that
would
be
a
per
se
violation?
not
at
all.
finally,
so
there
is
nothing
to
this
labor
exemption.
as
the
court
said
recently,
court
said
in
pennigton,
justice
white's
opinion.
you
cannot
just
say
conditions
of
the
employment
wages,
you
have
to
interpret
the
terms.
this
is
perplexed
to
be
condition
of
employment,
servitude
is
not
a
condition
of
employment
nor
a
slavery.
can
you
conceive
any
union
being
charged
with
a
failure
to
bargain
because
of
this?
i
cannot
conceive
that.
furthermore,
this
goes
beyond
the
bargaining
union,
the
opinion,
justice
brennan,
that
you
just
wrote,
affirming
pennigton
because
it
covers
the
minor
leagues
and
it
goes
beyond
that.
so
it
gets
out
of
the
bargaining
union,
and
for
all
these
reasons,
i
would
say
that
none
of
the
arguments
have
any
basis.
mr.
flood
was
the
victim
of
a
reserve
clause
which
in
my
view
violates
all
of
the
antitrust
statute.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
the
legality
under
federal
antitrust
and
state
statutory
and
commonwealth
organized
baseballs
through
reserved
system.
to
paraphrase
judge
waterman's
opinion
in
the
court
of
appeals,
this
is
a
scheme
which
binds
every
american
professional
baseball
player
to
one
team
or
it's
assignee
for
life.
and
which
compels
team
owners
to
boycott
the
player
or
property
of
another
team
owner,
and
to
boycott
any
fellow
owner,
and
to
boycott
the
player
himself
and
blacklist
him,
who
fails
to
abide
by
the
agreement
among
the
owners
to
eliminate
competition
in
recruitment
and
retention
of
personnel.
the
reach
of
the
reserve
system
extends
beyond
the
continental
united
states
and
even
our
new
states.
beyond
the
24
major
league
clubs
which
are
defendants
in
this
law
suit,
to
155
minor
league
clubs
organized
in
21
minor
leagues,
to
the
mexican
league
and
even
to
japan.
an
american
player
boycotted
by
organized
baseball
today
is
boycotted
by
japanese
employers
as
well.
perhaps
it
maybe
helpful
to
the
court,
if
i
having
stated
the
issue
now
review
a
few
of
the
pertinent
facts.
on
october
8,
1969
curtis
c.
flood
then
a
major
professional
ball
player
for
the
st.
louis
cardinals
was
traded,
his
contract
transferred
and
assigned
to
another
national
league
baseball
club,
the
philadelphia
phillies
as
part
of
the
multi-player
transaction
between
the
two
clubs.
as
judge
cooper
found
in
the
district
court
and
i
paraphrase
him
at
the
time
of
the
trade,
he
was
22
years
old,
a
veteran
of
12
years
of
service
with
the
cardinals.
co-captain
of
the
team
by
the
election
of
his
teammates.
and
acknowledged
to
be
a
player
of
exceptional
and
proven
ability.
about
that
the
record
is
very
clear,
in
his
active
service
with
the
st.
louis
cardinals,
he
batted
around
300,
won
several
golden
gloves
competition,
which
is
the
competition
for
excellent
fielding.
and
was
regarded
to
be
a
great
asset
for
that
team,
and
as
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
he
was
being
paid
$90,000
a
year.
not
a
salary
as
we
know
from
reading
the
newspapers
that
baseball
owners
throw
away
very
lightly.
the
circumstances
surrounding
his
assignment
or
as
judge
waterman
said
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
use
baseball
(inaudible)
sale
are
rather
interesting
as
part
of
the
background
of
this
litigation.
now
perhaps
that
explains
why
he
chose
to
use
the
courts
to
vindicate
his
rights,
although
he
had
deep
routes
in
st.
louis
missouri,
not
only
with
the
ball
club
which
he
had
served
faithfully
for
12
years.
he
was
also
an
artist
who
had
an
artist
studio.
he
had
two
photographic
studios
and
franchises
else
where.
and
he
had
many
friends
and
family
in
st.
louis.
he
was
not
consulted
about
the
training.
at
the
contrary
he
received
a
form
notice
and
then
a
telephone
call.
the
form
notice
was
a
very
cryptic
one.
record
itself
does
not
really
display
what
it
actually
is,
it's
a
printed
form.
and
in
that
printed
form,
there
is
a
checkbox.
your
contract
is
renewed,
your
contract
code
has
been
transferred,
you
have
been
released
from
the
service.
perhaps,
i
would
like
to
suggest
your
honors
you
might
want
to
look
at
the
exhibits
rather
than
the
cold
record,
to
see
how
this
form
is
filled
out.
i
should
say
at
all
fairness
to
my
distinguished
brothers
on
the
opposite
side,
he
also
received
a
telephone
call.
after
the
transaction
was
completed
not
before
presumably,
he
had
relinquished
all
of
his
rights
to
any
consultation
or
disposition
of
his
destiny.
when
at
the
age
of
15,
he
signed
a
contract
with
the
cincinnati
reds
that
without
the
without
the
assistance
of
an
attorney
which
was
the
practice
in
those
days
and
until
very
recently,
until
the
1970
contract.
he
signed
his
first
professional
baseball
contract
for
an
average
salary
of
$4000,
which
of
course
worked
his
way
up
the
ladder,
but
he
was
playing
last.
he
enjoyed
this
very
generous
salary.
the
fact
that
he
was
an
exceptional
player
as
judge
cooper
found
in
the
district
court
and
judge
waterman
speaking
for
the
court
of
appeals
confirmed
that
finding.
it
was
illustrated
by
his
batting
averages.
after
he
started
to
play
full
time
in
1962
he
had
been
there
since
1958
with
st.
louis
cardinals
his
batting
averages
were
1962
296,
1963
302,
1964
311,
1965
310,
1965
267,
1967
335,
1968
301,
1969
285.
i
am
not
a
great
mathematician
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justices,
but
this
seems
to
me
to
be
a
batting
average
around
300.
he
was
also
the
winner
of
several
golden
gloves
awards.
these
are
awards
given
to
players
for
excellent
in
fielding.
he
got
this
notice,
this
form
notice
without
advance
consultation,
and
he
got
the
telephone
call
telling
him
that
he
had
to
uproot
himself,
his
family,
his
business
connections
and
move
to
philadelphia.
on
december
24,
1969
mr.
flood
wrote
to
the
commissioner
of
baseball,
respondent
to
mr.
bowie
kuhn,
the
commissioner
of
baseball
asserting
his
rights
to
negotiate
with
team
other
than
philadelphia
and
state.
and
it's
a
rather
interesting
exchange,
this
was
his
letter
in
part,
the
relevant
part,
“dear
mr.
khun
after
12
years
in
the
major
leagues,
i
do
not
feel
that
i
am
a
piece
of
property
to
be
brought
and
sold,
irrespective
of
my
wishes.
i
believe
that
any
system
which
produces
that
vital
result
violates
my
basic
rights
as
a
citizen,
and
is
inconsistent
with
the
laws
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
law
of
federal
states.”
the
commissioner
of
baseball
mr.
khun
replied,
dear
curt
this
is
frankly
reminiscent
to
me
of
a
unanimous
decision
of
the
supreme
court,
which
reverse
the
hamilton
case
because
a
witness
was
addressed
by
her
first
name
while
other
witnesses
were
addressed
by
their
last
names.
putting
that
aside
the
letter
read,
“dear
curt,
while
we
agreed
with
the
contention
that
as
a
human
being
you
are
not
a
piece
of
property
to
be
bought
and
sold.
and
this
is
fundamental
to
our
society
and
could
not
see
its
applicability
of
the
situation
on
him.”
faced
with
the
sale
which
he
deemed
to
be
an
impairment
of
his
legal
rights
and
denial
of
his
request
that
he
be
made
a
free
agent
of
liberty
to
seek
employment
with
other
teams
and
without
subjecting
the
new
employer
to
boycott
by
the
team
owners,
he
had
no
recourse
in
his
opinion,
other
than
to
mount
this
law
suit.
and
this
law
suit
challenges
the
reserve
system
which
permits
this
to
be
done.
mr.
flood
adhered
to
his
refusal
to
play
for
philadelphia
during
the
1970
season.
well,
then
philadelphia
sold
its
exclusive
right
to
negotiate
with
flood,
to
the
washington
senators
after
1970
season
concluded,
and
until
the
necessity
compelled
him
to
acquiescence.
so
we
have
the
reserve
system,
not
unfamiliar
to
this
court,
because
this
court
has
passed
upon
it.
i
think
wrongly
in
two
cases
and
particularly
toolson.
i
think
a
very
accurate
description
of
the
reserve
clause
as
contained
both
in
the
district
court
opinion
and
in
judge
waterman's
opinion
for
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
whole
court
of
appeals,
judge
moore
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
judge
waterman
in
the
court
of
appeals
described
the
reserve
system
as
a
system
and
i
quote
him,
“which
pursuant
to
a
nationwide
agreement”
and
i
shall
say
a
word
about
that,
clubs,
baseball
clubs
effectively
restrict
a
baseball
player,
if
he
desires
to
play
professional
baseball
at
all,
contract
negotiations
with
that
club
that
organized
baseball
which
firstly
employs
or
reserves
it,
or
with
that
clubs,
assignee
club.
now
in
the
subsequent
assignee
clubs
to
which
in
the
(inaudible)
and
i
am
quoting
judge
waterman,
“he
has
been
sold
or
traded,
there
is
a
more
expensive
treatment
of
how
the
reserve
system
operates
citing
the
rules
which
govern
the
baseball
rules
in
judge
cooper's
opinion
in
the
district
court.”
now
while
i
disagree
with
his
conclusion,
i
do
not
disagree
that
judge
cooper
correctly
describes
how
the
reserve
system
operates.
briefly,
in
addition
to
judge
waterman's
pungent
and
succinct
description
it
goes
beyond
that.
no
other
club
may
bid
for
his
services,
once
he
signs.
he
is
not
permitted
to
approach
any
other
club.
that's
called
the
no
tampering
rule.
a
club
which
violates
this
rule
is
subject
to
boycott
by
the
other
clubs.
in
fact,
any
player
that
plays
for
another
club
which
violates
this
rule,
is
subject
to
discipline,
by
the
commissioner
of
baseball.
and
it
also
extends
beyond,
judge
waterman
did
not
deal
with
clubs,
the
major
league
clubs
that
extends
the
minor
league
club,
that
extends
to
the
mexican
league,
that
extends
even
to
japan.
this
is
un-contradicted
in
the
record.
now
mr.
flood
stated
out
in
1970
and
pursues
this
law
suit,
challenging
the
reserve
system
on
several
grounds.
first,
that
it
violates
the
antitrust
laws
of
the
united
states,
second
that
it
violates
the
antitrust
laws
and
common
law
of
the
several
states,
and
third
that
it
violates
the
thirteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution,
of
the
united
states
prescribing
that
indentured
service
as
well
as
slavery
should
not
be
permitted.
now,
as
he
stayed
out
in
1970
as
i
have
said,
he
was
confronted
with
1971,
and
at
that
time
philadelphia
the
team
that
owned
him,
again
i
quote,
paraphrased
as
waterman’s
opinion,
“the
team
that
owns
him
sold
him
to
washington.
he
agreed
to
play
for
washington,
he
was
there
for
a
few
months
and
we
can
all
take
judicial
notice,
i
think
of
what
occurred
layman,
lawyers
and
i
believe
this
court,
he
tried,
he
had
been
laid
off
for
a
year.
after
trying
for
a
few
months
in
spring
training
and
in
the
actual
season
he
was
best,
he
could
not
easily
regain
his
skills
which
is
not
difficult
to
understand
and
he
left”.
now,
the
transfer
to
philadelphia,
the
transfer
from
philadelphia
to
washington
was
accompanied
by
stipulations
between
ourselves
and
opposing
counsel
that
this
was
not
connected
to
this
lawsuit.
i
am
well
aware
however
that
private
people
cannot
stipulate
a
case
for
this
court,
but
the
transfer
did
not
moot
this
case
and
radovich,
the
football
case,
this
court
held
that
the
success
of
a
boycott
did
not
moot
the
case
and
furthermore
he
had
experienced
damages
in
1970,
and
he
had
suffered
impairment
of
his
career.
now,
i
turn
to
the
reserve
clause.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
they
offered
him
an
increase
to
a
$100,000
with
salary
and
another
benefits,
but
that
was
not
what
he
was
contesting,
he
was
contesting
being
removed
without
his
consent
and
as
his
letter
states
he
didn't
want
to
be
treated
as
channel
property,
question
of
principle.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
it
is
not
by
the
way
new
although
i
have
seen
articles
about
it
which
indicates
that
this
high
paid
ball
player
did
things
as
you
know
that,
why
did
he
do
it
when
other
ball
players,
by
the
way
despite
of
all
the
stories
in
press
in
the
five
years
previous
had
only
averaged
a
little
over
$8,000
a
year,
why
this
high
paid
ball
player
did
this?
he
did
it
as
he
simply
said,
out
of
principle.
he
no
longer
wanted
to
be
treated
as
channel
property,
he
made
that
decision
on
his
own
and
although
he
has
been
supported
in
this
litigation
by
the
players
association
about
which
i
shall
later
have
reference.
this
was
his
decision,
the
record
is
very
plain
on
that,
in
fact
he
was
told
by
the
director
mr.
miller
that
he
had
a
tough
case,
nevertheless
he
felt
in
good
conscience
he
had
to
presume.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
exactly,
mr.
justice
provided
this
clause
is
legal
and
i
shall
say
it
is
not.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
he
said
that
what
he
wanted,
what
is
the
opportunity
as
a
free
agent
to
negotiate
his
own
deal,
not
to
be
traded
as
this
form
that
i
have
referred,
indicates
without
his
concern.
now
the
reserve
clause
has
been
in
existence
one
hundred
years
long
and
today
any
union
that
the
ball
players
formed,
which
i
shall
talk
about
in
the
labor
exemption,
with
one
important
modification.
in
1965,
the
reserve
system
was
extended
for
the
first
time
to
potential
new
players
who
had
never
signed
an
agreement
with
any
team
and
typically
these
are
teenagers
just
graduated
from
high
school
or
who
have
dropped
out
of
high
school.
this
had
never
been
done.
this
category
not
in
the
minor
leagues
they
until
65
enjoyed
the
privilege
of
negotiating
their
first
contract,
that
no
longer
exist.
they
have
a
semiannual
draft.
there
is
another
factor
which
i
shall
advert
to
when
i
talk
about
the
so
called
labor
exemption.
judge
cooper
found
that
the
baseball’s
reserve
system
is
not
presently,
collectively
agreed
to.
citation
is
in
my
brief,
i
shall
not
burden
you
with
the
citation.
now
when
flood
decided
to
sue,
he
challenges
as
i
have
said
on
several
grounds.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
no.
and
i
shall
discuss
that
when
i
come
to
the
labor
exemption.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
will
move
fast,
because
of
the
shortness
of
time,
we
have
these
three
of
our
positions.
on
the
first
the
anti-trust
laws
we
are
confronted
obviously
with
two
decisions
in
this
court,
federal
baseball
decided
in
1942
and
toolson
decided
in
1953.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
they
would
have
to
overruled,
they
should
be
overruled,
they
should
be
overruled
for
very
good
reasons,
they
should
be
overruled
because
the
first
one
federal
baseball
was
not
as
judge
friendly
has
said,
“justice
holmes
happiest
hour”,
indeed.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes,
but
even
then
it
showed,
i
doubt
that
justice
holmes
had
never
seen
a
ball
game--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes
but
it
has
and
quite
recently
as
i
shall
point
out
in
a
moment
in
reading
throwing
opinion
written
by
justice
stewart
for
a
unanimous
court
in
construing
a
statute.
there
is
a
case
that
put
aside
the
collins
versus
hardyman,
the
federal
baseball
in
fact
was
abandoned
by
justice
holmes
the
very
next
term
--
and
toolson
was
a
percuriam
which
merely
said
that
while
we
have
done
it
even
though
we
think
it’s
wrong
because
interstate
commerce
has
changed,
well,
we
rather
leave
it
to
congress
and
the
court
was
troubled
at
that
time
with
whether
or
not
prospective
rulings
could
be
met,
that
problem
of
course
has
been
settled
by
this
court
even
quite
recently
and
i
shall
mention
that.
now,
i
say
to
you
very
simply,
i
shall
not
be
elaborate
that
federal
baseball
was
wrong.
the
development
of
law
or
what
constitutes
the
commerce
was
considered
the
base
and
no
one
would
doubt
that
baseball
is
engaged
in
the
interstate
commerce.
this
court
in
radovich
this
court
shubert
theaters,
this
court
in
the
boxing
area
have
all
characterized
sports,
if
they
are
so
called
as
in
interstate
commerce
baseball
indeed
is
an
interstate
commerce
in
a
very
big
way.
that
is
a
tremendous
institution
that
sends
people
all
over
the
company
and
in
canada.
it
realizes
enormous
revenues
from
television
i
think
i
saw
the
other
day
that
in
the
national
contract
television
rights,
they
realized
$41
million
and
then
it
supplemented
their
local
contracts.
now
we
have
here
a
question
of
stare
decisis
that
i
thought
that
this
had
been
put
to
rest
involving
a
statute--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
it
depends
on
what
way
labor
is
treated,
labor
should
not
be
an
article
of
commerce.
clayton
act
says
it
should
not
be
a
commodity.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes,
because
he
is
been
treated
as
a
commodity,
as
everybody
is
under
the
reserve
rule.
he
is
not
treated
his
labor
as
we
traditionally
understand
labor
people
to
be
treated,
free
american
workers
determining
their
own
destiny.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes
it
did,
the
same
issue
was
radovich
and
decided
against
the
football
owners
which
brought
radovich,
which
were
involved
in
radovich's
decision
in
this
court.
it
was
argued
in
radovich,
and
i
do
not
know
what
prompted
this
court
to
take
certiorari,
i
had
not
assumed
the
purpose
of
the
grant
and
this
necessarily
follows,
if
it
is
treated
as
a
labor
exemption
which
i
shall
talk
about.
if,
it
is
decided
that
the
labor
exemptions
so
called
applies,
then
that
certainly
applies
to
football
they
have
a
union,
certainly
applies
to
hockey
and
the
consequences
of
a
decision
holding
that
the
labor
exemption
applies
to
baseball
may
necessarily
mean
that
it
applies
to
all
of
the
sports,
so
called
sports.
otherwise
it's
very
interesting
when
you
read
this
record,
as
i
know
you
have
or
will,
bowie
kuhn
the
commissioner
of
baseball
does
not
refer
to
it
as
a
sport.
he
refers
to
it
as
an
entertainment,
as
entertainment
it's
governed
by
your
decision
in
shubert
which
says
that
subject
to
antitrust
regulation.
the
decision
justice
stewart
that
i
mentioned,
in
a
statutory
construction
is
your
own
in
griffin
versus
breckenridge,
perhaps
i
shall
read
only
a
few
sentences.
whether
or
not
collins
versus
hardyman
construes
the
civil
rights
act.
correctly
decided
at
its
own
fact
is
a
question
with
which
we
need
not
here
be
concerned,
but
it
is
clear
in
light
of
the
evolution
of
decisional
law,
that
had
passed
since
the
case
was
decided
that
many
of
the
constitutional
problems
there,
proceeds
simply
do
not
exist.
justice
holmes
conceived
there
was
a
constitutional
problem.
the
only
reasons
remains
therefore
not
to
accord
to
the
words
of
the
statute,
their
apparent
meaning.
i
move
quickly
to
the
next
point.
i
think
that
it
ought
to
be
overruled.
it's
anomaly
in
the
law,
every
common
theater
has
said
it's
anomaly
in
the
law
to
adhere
to
toolson
and
to
federal
baseball
as
improperly
decided.
now
i
move
quickly
to
the
next
point.
and
that
is
state
law,
peculiarly
enough
as
judge
waterman
even
says
they
were
the
we
were
in
the
horns
of
a
dilemma.
the
federal
law
did
not
apply
because
it
was
not
interstate
commerce.
why
should
not
state
law
apply?
judge
waterman
said
contrary
to
the
district
court,
which
said
it
was
preempted
judge
waterman
says
that
it
was
interfering
with
interstate
commerce.
i
take
that
this
has
no
foundation
whatsoever.
the
decisions
of
this
court
are
plenty
and
ample.
well,
the
subject
that
state
laws
were
to
carry
out
for
the
purposes
of
the
great
federal
statutes
for
sherman
act
which
are
not
inconsistent
ought
to
be
applied.
and
then
that
is
the
law.
authoritatively
the
sherman
act
said
that
our
law
is
designed
to
supplement,
not
disgrace
federal
law.
there
is
no
preemption
here,
expressed
or
implied,
there
is
no
conflict
nor
as
any
court
found
one.
judge
waterman
says,
there
is
a
necessity
for
uniformity
or
there
was
no
inquiry
into
the
state
statutes
to
determine
whether
there
was.
we
have
listed
the
state
statutes
and
briefly
summarized,
they
are
the
same
as
the
sherman
act.
those
states
that
have
adopted
it.
so
the
decision,
for
example,
in
the
continental
airlines
case
covers
that.
finally
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
pardon.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes,
he
left
--
he
left
now.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
no,
it's
not
because
the
70
season,
is
the
season
where
he
has
right
to
recover
damages
because
he
returned
later
and
he
also
has
right
to
decide
if
he
wants
to
go
to
minor
leagues,
or
japan
which
are
subjected
to
the
same
rules.
i
will
say
one
word,
i
should
take
a
few
more
minutes
of
my
time
and
comes
off
of
rebuttal.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
about,
yes.
about
the
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
there
is
nothing
too
bad
to
the
baseball
argument
that
a
new
found
affection
for
the
collective
bargaining
and
the
labor
act.
i
share
that
affection,
in
fact,
i
shared
it
for
many,
many
years.
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
this
is
hardcore
violation
of
the
antitrust
law.
this
is
a
group
boycott
and
blacklisting,
all
of
this
under
the
rules
are
obligated
not
to
deal
with
a
player,
if
he
is
on
a
reserve
list,
he
is
blacklisted
not
only
here
but
in
mexico
and
in
japan.
and
this
is
the
most
obvious
restraint
of
trait
known
to
man.
i'll
put
a
simple
illustration.
as
your
honor
is
well
know,
i
once
represented
the
steelworkers.
let
me
put
a
proposition.
suppose
the
steelworkers
union,
they
would
never
do
this,
agreed
with
us
steel,
that
if
a
man
signed
up,
he
had
to
work
for
us
steel
all
his
life
and
if
(inaudible)
employed
him
and
he
left.
if
(inaudible)
employed
him,
us
steel
will
not
supply
parts
for
their
fabricating
or
steel
for
their
fabricating
operations.
is
there
any
doubt
in
anybody's
mind
that
would
be
a
per
se
violation?
not
at
all.
finally,
so
there
is
nothing
to
this
labor
exemption.
as
the
court
said
recently,
court
said
in
pennigton,
justice
white's
opinion.
you
cannot
just
say
conditions
of
the
employment
wages,
you
have
to
interpret
the
terms.
this
is
perplexed
to
be
condition
of
employment,
servitude
is
not
a
condition
of
employment
nor
a
slavery.
can
you
conceive
any
union
being
charged
with
a
failure
to
bargain
because
of
this?
i
cannot
conceive
that.
furthermore,
this
goes
beyond
the
bargaining
union,
the
opinion,
justice
brennan,
that
you
just
wrote,
affirming
pennigton
because
it
covers
the
minor
leagues
and
it
goes
beyond
that.
so
it
gets
out
of
the
bargaining
union,
and
for
all
these
reasons,
i
would
say
that
none
of
the
arguments
have
any
basis.
mr.
flood
was
the
victim
of
a
reserve
clause
which
in
my
view
violates
all
of
the
antitrust
statute.
