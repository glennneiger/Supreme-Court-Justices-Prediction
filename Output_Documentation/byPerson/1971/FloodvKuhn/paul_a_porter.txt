mr.
paul
a.
porter
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
wish
to
take
about
five
minutes,
i
represent
the
respondent
bowie
kuhn,
commissioner
of
baseball
who
was
the
defendant
below
on
the
count
of
one,
and
that
was
the
antitrust
law.
mr.
holmes
then
will
discuss
the
issues
in
the
case,
and
totally
what
we
all
agree
is
the
central
issue.
mainly,
that
this
litigation
involves
basically
a
labor
dispute.
now
the
commissioner
of
baseball
serves
for
a
term
of
seven
years,
for
odd
plenary
powers,
both
in
administrative
and
quasi-judicial
nature
to
preside
over
the
institution
of
professional
baseball.
his
first
point,
fundamental
function
is
to
maintain
the
integrity
of
the
sport
on
the
playing
field
and
public
confidence
and
the
honesty
of
the
game.
he
has
the
authority
under
the
rules
of
baseball,
to
take
whatever
action
in
his
judgment
is
in
the
best
interest
of
baseball,
and
he
has
acquired
on
frequent
occasions
to
evaluate
under
that
standard
and
way
in
the
interest
of
players
and
perhaps
their
fans
alike.
now
baseball
as
it
has
been
recognized
by
this
court
again
and
again,
is
a
unique
structure,
primarily
bottomed
on
responsible
self-government.
the
office
of
the
commissioner
as
we
all
recognized,
beginning
the
(inaudible)
was
established
to
police
the
honesty
of
this
court.
since
it
is
developed
into
institutional
apparatus
to
reconcile
many
minor
and
major
issues
in
appropriate
administration
and
the
structure
as
the
whole.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
not
presumably
mr.
justice
brennan.
may
have
copied
including
the
reserve
systems,
essentially
the
same
as
structure
and
the
pattern
as
baseball.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
well
it
is
never
been
challenged
expect
in
radovich.
they
have
settled
a
number
of
cases
as
mr.
hoynes
will
develop.
the
spencer
haywood
case
is
a
notable
exception.
and
they
have
been
living
on
the
brink,
i
think.
they
recognized
it?
mr.
paul
a.
porter
indeed
we
are.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
indeed
we
are.
yes
sir,
and
i
can
develop
that
if
time
is
permitted
where
we
have
spent
25
percent
of
our
revenues
for
player
development,
major
league
revenues.
now
the
other
sports
have
their
forms
as
per
the
college
and
there
are
many
other
distinctions.
now,
the
commissioner
because
of
his
neutral
position
has
no
participation
in
the
bargaining
that
has
gone
along
with
respect
to
the
reserve
system.
now
he
testified
in
the
district
court
that
this
system
was
not
a
fossilized
system,
engraved
in
habris
(ph)
v.
stone
--
it
was
subject
to
changes
and
modifications
and
indeed
it
has
been
changed
and
modified.
the
commissioner
also
gave
important
testimony
on
two
particular
areas
that
i
would
direct
your
attention
to.
number
one;
that
without
some
continuity
of
employment
between
clubs
and
players,
the
relative
equality
of
competition
and
the
honesty
of
the
sport
would
be
seriously
impairing.
i
would
respectfully
direct
your
honors
attention
to
the
commissioner’s
testimony
which
is
summarized
in
our
appendix.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
well,
i
think
that
mr.
justice
white
this
is
a
labor
dispute.
it's
a
bargainable
issue
has
judge
cooper
found
as
i
think
the
second
circuit
and
judge
cooper
said
that
all
evidence
have
not
been
fully
exhausted
in
the
bargaining
process
and
indeed
as
mr.
hoynes
will
develop
this
issue
was
on
the
bargaining
table
while
in
the
toolson,
while
this
litigation
was
brought
by
the
players
union.
also
i
would
direct
your
attention
finally
to
the
commissioner’s
testimony
exhibiting
(inaudible)
which
is
exhibit
a
found
in
page
407
of
the
appendix.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
oh,
it
was
really
financed
by
the
players
union
and
indeed
that's
conceded
in
this
record.
one
final
point
i
would
like
to
make
inspite
of
--
mr.
paul
a.
porter
absolutely.
yes
sir.
and
inspite
of
all
the
record
that
we
hear
here
about
this
being
a
per
se
violation,
and
the
trial
record
below
with
exception
of
the
petitioner
mr.
flood
all
the
witnesses
in
support
of
mr.
flood's
case,
testify
that
some
form
of
reserve
system
was
essential.
and
i
will
not
consume
my
time
as
consumed
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
paul
a.
