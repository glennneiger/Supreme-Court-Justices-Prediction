mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
counsel
for
the
national
league
and
i
here
represent
the
24
major
league
clubs
and
the
two
major
leagues.
the
issues
presented
here
are--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
no,
it's
not
my
position
that
baseball
is
not
commerce
your
honor.
i
think
that
has
been
well
recognized.
indeed
it
is
recognized
by
the
toolson
decision.
the
issues
are
here
much
broader
than
curt
flood’s
particular
situation
which
has
been
described
by
mr.
justice
goldberg.
this
is
fundamentally
in
our
view
institutional
litigation
concerting
the
normal
operation
of
baseball’s
basic
fundamental
and
historic
rules.
and
the
real
protagonists
here
are
suggested
by
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
few
moments
ago.
the
real
protagonists
are
the
players
union,
the
major
league
baseball
players
association
and
the
major
league
clubs
that
i
represent--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
the
record
shows
in
very
great
detail
your
honor
as
does
the
opinion
of
judge
cooper
devoted
a
good
portion
of
his
opinion
to
tracing
the
effectiveness
of
bargaining,
the
effectiveness
of
the
union--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
yes
all
of
the
players
in
major
league
baseball
really
are
members
of
players
association.
they
have
been
association
that
has
been
recognized
by
the
clubs
as
the
formal
collective
bargaining
agent
for
the
football
players.
and
all
of
the
terms
and
condition
of
employment
of
a
major
league
baseball
player
are
in
fact
on
the
table
on
a
more
or
less
constant
basis
--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
well.
there
has
been
no
dispute
over
the
propriety
of
their
representation.
however
there
have
been
a
couple
of
unfair
labor
practice
charges
that
have
been
brought
and
processed
by
the
nlrb,
and
the
nlrb
of
course
asserted
jurisdiction
and
that
point
is
not
debated
by
either
side.
it's
part
of
the
workings
of
major
league
baseball
as
we
know
it
today
have
known
it
for
sometime.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
no,
i
was
referring
to
proceedings
involved
in
the
major
league
baseball
players
association.
some
of
the
dispute
at
the
beginning
of
this
year
on
the
question
of
the
relationship
between
television
revenues
and
bargain
on
the
pension
plan.
there
was
a
disputes
as
to
the
extent
to
which
we
were
required
to
disclose
certain
information.
nlrb
involved
itself
in
working
that
matter
out,
complaint
was
issued
and
so
forth.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
it's
a
player
for
minor
league
player?
your
honor,
i
would
not
be
able
to
say
to
you
that
bargaining
directly
representing
the
minor
league
players
was
being
carried
on,
but
the
major
league
baseball
players
association
certainly
has
bargained
with
the
interest
of
the
minor
league
players
in
mind.
indeed
many
of
the
grievances
that
have
been
brought
before.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
bargaining
with
the
minor
league
players
directly?
no,
there
is
no
direct
formal
representation
by
the
minor
league
players.
that
does
not
mean
they
are
unrepresented
however,
i
suggest
that
their
interest
as
part
of
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
well
at
my
position
would
be
the
same
your
honor.
i
simply
would
not
be
able
to
point
to
the
direct
one
to
one
relationship
between
a
formal
bargaining
representative
and
with
that
particular
players
i
can
with
the
mr.
flood,
it
was
clearly
represented
and
a
member
of
the
organization
but
i
would
still
argue
your
honor
even
if
the
minor
league
player
--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
i
mean,
as
far
as
the
assignment
of
flood's
contract?
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
no
that
contract
assignment
took
place
under
the
rules
which
themselves
were
the
subject
to
bargaining.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
well,
no
one--.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
i
call
it
union
your
honor.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
the
union
after
the
transaction
took
place,
conferred
with
mr.
flood
as
i
understand
it
and
ultimately
agreed
with
him
to
finance
the
cost
of
his
litigation
and
as
i
was
about
to
point
out,
it
is
quite
transparent
i
believe
from
the
reading
of
the
record
that
the
players
association,
the
players
union
has
in
fact
controlled
this
litigation
from
beginning
to
end.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
we
certainly
are
interested
in
not
litigating
your
honor,
we
believe
that--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
well,
when
the
law
suit
--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
no
representations
by
the
union
were
made
to
us
--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
seeking
any
--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
your
honor,
i
believe
it
is
during
the
pendency
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
these
rules
were
part
of
an
arrangement
and
bargaining
was
not
to
take
place
until
a
subsequent
period.
the
transfer
was
entirely
in
accord
because
of
arrangements.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
your
honor
i
don't
believe
the
unions
ever
agreed
to
that.
i
don't
think
that
what
happened
with
mr.
flood.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
the
reserve
system
is
not
simply
a
paragraph
but
a
number
of
inter-related
rules--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
i
believe
that's
right
your
honor
–
i
beg
your
pardon,
with
the
management.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
well,
your
honor
there
are
the
collective
bargain
agreements
in
the
record.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
your
honor,
a
collectively
bargained
agreement
is
an
agreement
signed
obviously
by
the
union
and
by
management
and
all
of
the
major
league
rules
where
encompassed
by
that
agreement.
i
can't
think
of
a
plainer
way
to
demonstrate
it.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
well,
the
union
your
honor
is
i
think
having
participated
in
the
bargaining
on
management
side
for
the
last
several
years,
has
made
remarkable
gains
with
respect
to
player
club
relationships.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
well
the
union
is
--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
no,
i
would
not
say
nothing.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
no,
i
certainly
would
not
say
that.
i
would
say
that
the
reserve
clause
itself,
the
very
core
of
the
reserve
clause
is
a
subject
admitted
by
both
sides,
a
mandatory
subject
of
bargaining
and
something
about
which
bargaining
was
going
on
when
interrupted
by
the
pendency
the
filing
of
this
lawsuit.
and
it
is
back
to
that
form
your
honor
that
we
believe
this
matter
should
be
remitted.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
back
to
the
collective
bargaining
table.
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
well
the
union
is
protecting
the
individual.
your
honor,
this
union
is
very
well.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
your
honor,
the
union
bargains
obviously
for
future
benefits
and
what's
at
stake
here
is
the
shape
of
baseball
and
its
employee
relations
really
for
the
future.
mr.
flood
is
--
i
think
there
is
no
question
about
that.
he
is
retired
from
baseball
now.
he
is
through
with
baseball
he
--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
well,
i
would
call
it
voluntarily
retired
at
this
point,
your
honor.
he
was
playing
for
washington
and
felt
that
he
no
longer
could
play
satisfactory
to
his
standards
and
he
had
other
problems
as
well
and
he
left
the
country.
we
were
most
eager
to
have
the
employee
during
the
pendency
of
this
lawsuit.
we
told
his
counsel
repeatedly
that
we
would
make
no
argument
whatsoever
that
the
case
had
been
mooted
and
that
we
wanted
to
see
curt
flood
playing
and
living
his
normal
life
and
litigation
could
go
forward.
if
they
would
not
hear
one
word
from
us
that
there
was
something
inconsistent
about
him
playing
and
litigating.
we
made
no
threats.
it
was
suggested
constantly
that
this
be
done
and
in
1971
curt
flood
decided
he
would
return
to
baseball.
his
play
was
of
the
caliber
that
as
a
proud
man,
his
play
was
of
the
caliber
that
was
not
satisfactory
to
him.
he
had
other
financial
business
problems
which
caused
him
to
leave
to
both
the
washington
area
and
the
united
states.
we
regretted
that
very
much.
we
would
have
been
delighted
to
see
mr.
flood
continue
a
long
and
prosperous
career.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
none
of
which
is
in
the
record
your
honor.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
well,
the
record
was
closed
before
he
began
to
play
for
washington
your
honor,
yes.
i
think
that
justice
goldberg
adverted
to
it
and
i
am
sure
you
could
take
notice
of
that
fact.
as
i
had
mentioned
before,
it
is
our
position
that
the
players
union
is
entirely
in
control
of
this
litigation,
and
that
it
is
concerned
less
with
remedying
any
alleged
wrong
that
may
have
been
performed
on
mr.
flood,
that
it
is
trying
to
reorganize
the
employment
relationships
in
professional
baseball.
in
other
words,
the
union
is
after
a
larger
game
here.
mr.
flood's
testimony
itself
was
isolated
from
the
rest
of
the
case
presented,
on
behalf
of
petitioner.
he
testified
that
he
would
like
the
entire
system
to
be
torn
apart,
and
like
every
ball
player
to
be
free
to
negotiate
with
any
club
of
his
choice.
while
all
of
the
other
witnesses
testified
on
behalf
of
petitioner,
limited
their
testimony
to
certain
modifications,
that
they
suggested
in
a
reserve
system.
all
assuming
that
some
continuity
of
player
control,
some
form
of
player
reserve
system
would
in
fact
be
necessary.
this
testimony
represented
a
repudiation
of
really
mr.
flood's
position,
and
left
him
a
forgotten
him
for
the
reminder
of
the
case.
in
fact
no
evidence
at
all
was
offered
on
the
damages,
which
mr.
flood's
complaint
indicated
he
had
suffered
to
his
outside
business
interest
in
st.
louis,
not
a
shred
of
it
was
ever
offered
on
that
matter.
that's
the
union
as
i
have
said,
was
after
a
larger
game.
it
intended
to
subvert
the
collective
bargaining
process
in
baseball
to
obtain
games
which
it
had
not
yet
achieved
at
the
bargaining
table,
outside
of
the
bargaining
table,
and
to
unravel
the
very
fabric
of
past
collecting
bargaining,
all
of
which
interwoven
intimately
with
the
reserve
system.
in
order
to
accomplish
this
purpose,
the
petitioner
has
attempted
to
persuade
this
court
to
move
radically
in
two
new
directions.
first
to
change
the
law
abruptly
and
totally,
by
overruling
the
narrow
and
well
confined
precedents
of
long
standing,
which
now
indicate
that
baseball
is
not
subjected
to
the
antitrust
laws.
and
second
to
declare
illegal,
per
se
illegal,
i
believe
according
to
their
briefs,
baseball's
historical
reserve
system
as
the
trial
court
found
the
corner
stone
of
the
game,
and
to
act
in
effect
as
a
compulsory
arbitrator
in
an
employee-employer
dispute,
about
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
in
baseball,
in
fashioning
a
new
system.
a
trial
was
demanded
to
--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
your
honor,
the
adaption
of
the
draft
system
is
simply
one
more
step,
and
a
number
of
steps
that
baseball
had
taken
over
a
period
of
years
to
try
to
equalize
competition
on
a
playing
field,
preceding
the
draft
rule
there
were
rules
about
bonus
issue,
you
may
remember
this.
if
a
bonus
of
a
certain
size
was
awarded
to
a
player,
that
player
must
serve
immediately
on
a
major
league
roster.
all
of
these
were
efforts
to
prevent
the
clubs
with
the
largest
accumulations
of
wealth
in
being
able
to
attract
the
most
skillful
young
ball
player,
and
none
of
those
system
soon
--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
well
i
think
the
first
bonuses
were
probably
of
large
amount
were
paid
in
50s.
sometime
before
the
rule
or
the
65
free
agent
draft,
i
might
note
on
the
free
agent
draft
subject
that
all
of
the
other
sports
have
free
agent
drafts.
in
fact,
in
the
other
sports
the
rights
to
negotiate
with
a
player
are
perpetual.
once
he
is
--
an
amateur
is
drafted,
he
can
negotiate
only
during
his
lifetime,
with
the
club
that
drafted
him,
and
in
baseball
the
negotiating
rights
are
only
of
6
months
duration,
and
if
a
player
doesn't
sign
with
the
club
that
drafted
him,
he
maybe
reselected
by
another
club.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
well,
your
honor,
there
are
number
of
differences
in
the
employment
relationship
between
football,
and
baseball,
and
a
number
of
differences
in
the
sport,
the
character
of
the
sport
themselves.
an
obvious
difference
that
receives
much
publicity
is
the
option
rule
in
professional
football.
a
system
by
which
a
player
can
declare
at
the
beginning
of
the
season
that
he
desires
to
move
to
another
pastures
at
the
end
of
that
season,
he
then
plays
an
option
--
they
call
like
it
the
(inaudible)
option.
at
the
end
of
that
additional
year,
he
is
technically
free
to
seek
employment
by
another
club.
the
rule
has
another
provision
that
says
that
any
other
club
that
signs
that
player
must
compensate
to
the
club
from
which
the
player
came,
either
in
the
amount
measured
by
money
players,
draft
choices,
what
have
you,
satisfactory
to
that
former
club
or
if
a
new
agreement
can
be
reached,
that
the
commissioner
will
establish
compensation.
the
major
league
baseball
players
association
is
announced
this
arrangement
as
essentially
a
fraudulent
one,
and
in
fact
there's
been
a
little
mobility
historically
in
football,
and
if
one
examines
the
collective
bargaining
process
going
on
in
football,
one
will
see
that
the
football
players
themselves
denounced
the
arrangement
as
being
essentially
a
cosmetic
one,
and
not
one
affords
them
any
real
freedom
of
choice
and
then
seeking
their
employment.
other
differences
in
employment
relationship
in
football,
and
baseball,
rather
than
football,
the
management
may
establish
the
rules
of
the
game.
in
baseball
our
collective
bargaining
agreement
expressly
recognizes
the
duty
of
the
major
league
clubs
before
enacting
any
rule
or
involving
in
any
way,
player
benefits
or
player
rights
to
negotiate
that
rule
with
the
players.
also
in
baseball,
there
is
an
grievance
procedure
which
has
been
agreed
to
with
the
players
association,
one
that’s
un-parallel
by
any
other
sport
which
places
all
grievances
about
club
and
player
matters
except
those
involve
the
integrity,
which
are
reserved
for
the
commissioner
but
the
garden-variety
grievance
goes
before,
an
arbitrator
external
to
the
game,
a
man
now
named
lewis
gill
former
president
of
the
american
academy
of
arbitrators
jointly
selected
by
the
union
and
by
the
clubs.
he
has
handled
dozens
of
grievances
in
baseball,
makes
final
and
un-appealable
decisions
with
respect
to
them.
and
finally
with
respect
to
the
differences
in
the
character
of
the
game,
games
themselves
football
for
example,
and
baseball,
football
is
able
to
reach
out
and
plug
from
the
college
campuses
players
are
ready
to
play
professional
football,
already
nationally
known
and
skilled.
baseball
has
no
such
alternative,
baseball
has
an
elaborate
minor
league
system,
in
which
it
develop
its
own
players,
and
to
which
it
devotes
approximately
25%
of
the
major
league
gross
revenues.
something
over
a
million
dollars
per
year
per
club,
poured
into
the
minor
leagues
to
keep
the
flow
of
players,
to
keep
this
player
development
flow
operating.
there
isn't
any
sport,
any
professional
sport,
that
has
anything
that
even
proximates
that
sort
of
an
arrangement,
or
those
sort
of
expenses
and
difficulties
of
player
development.
for
all
these
reasons,
we
believe
and
the
players
association
recognizes
and
they're
bargaining
with
us,
that
the
experience
in
other
sports
is,
well
not
dissimilar
from
baseball's
really,
nevertheless
neither
is
it
a
good
guide
for
the
baseball
world.
there
are
important
differences
in
the
businesses
and
we
feel
and
as
i've
said
the
players
union
feels
too
that
we
must
work
out
our
own
relationships
in
the
light
of
realities
of
the
baseball
business,
not
in
the
light
of
what
some
other
sport
may
do,
or
some
arid
principles,
but
on
the
practical
level,
at
the
bargaining
table,
by
the
people
who
must
live
with
results
of
their
labors,
the
players
and
the
club
owners.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
you're
expressing
a
fact
your
honor.
your
honor
bargaining
had
just
begun
in
the
core
of
the
reserve
system
and
like
any
labor
union
they
think
they
see
an
easy
way
to
achieve
a
position
of
predominance,
a
better
position,
more
clogged
at
the
bargaining
table,
they
seize
the
opportunity.
i
think
there
is
little
doubt,
but
what
the
owner's
position
here
would
be
in
something
of
the
shambles.
if
this
court
would
rule
that
the
reserve
system
is
per
se
illegal.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
don't
know
how
bargaining
could
proceed
at
all.
i
don't
know
what
what
we
would
do
at
the
bargaining
table
because
presumably,
not
only
the
present
system
but
every
modification
there
too,
everything
that
we
might
have
work
out
in
this
area
with
the
union
would
be
forbidden
by
the
antitrust
laws.
and
even
if
only
our
present
system,
not
speaking
of
other
systems
were
to
be
declared
illegal,
still
there
would
be
a
third
party
at
the
bargaining
table
and
that
would
be
the
court
and
the
players
union
i
think
would
be
able
to
use
that
extremely
effectively.
we
would
been
buying
a
new
reserve
system
every
time
we
bargained
and
that
the
option
would
be
that
we
would
be
faced
with
more
litigation
and
wrapped
with
certainty,
that
probability
that
the
arrangements
would
be
illegal
without
their
acquiescence.
i
think
this
kind
of
intrusion
into
a
collective
bargaining
process
is
not
something
that
the
courts
commonly
do.
it's
something
that's
quite
inconsistent.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
only
factual
issues
presented
here,
obviously
the
broader
issue
is
toolson
exemption
which
we
believe
reaches
to
the
entire
structure
of
the
game,
not
only
reserve
system.
but
mr.
flood
and
the
union
here
are
complaining
only
about
the
reserve
system
and
--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
it's
quite
right
your
honor,
but
i
think
there
are
other
levels
of
decision
here
too,
the
labor
matter
that
we're
discussing
that
i'm
now
arguing,
that's
not
--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
that's
right
your
honor.
it's
a
separate
distinct
reason
for
the
use
of
result
as
well.
i
might
also
comment
as
in
--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
yes,
i
presume
we
could
also
lose
the
issue
here
on
broad
coverage
and
prevail
on
the
issue
that
no
suit
can
appropriately
be
brought
by
member
of
the
collective
bargaining
organization
and
matter
which
is
essentially
a
matter
of
collective
bargaining.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
no
your
honor
i
don't.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
no,
the
union
has
expressed
in
its
dealing
to
the
best
that
it
does
not
wish
to
bargain
except
to
set
minimums
and
other
parameters.
it
is
suggested
that
we
would
like
to
bargain
perhaps
not
only
by
minimums
--
at
flow,
but
but
perhaps
the
minimums
that
relate
to
some
very
seniority
levels
as
well,
but
it
does
not
wish
to
intrude
in
the
individual
negotiations
in
the
contract--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
that's
right
your
honor,
but
the
range
of
--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
it
certainly
could
your
honor.
that
would
be
a
mandatory
subject
if
the
union
were
to
raise
--
put
that
issue
on
the
bargaining
table,
we
would
have
no
choice
but
to
deal
with
it.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
we
would
have
put
it
on
the
bargaining
table
as
well.
i
think
both
sides
today
have
felt
that
it
is
not
in
the
interest
of
the
individual
players
or
off
the
process
to
--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
i
think
that
that
is
part
of
the
answer
your
honor,
yes.
it's
part
of
the
answer.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
well,
i
think
that
rest
of
the
answer
is
that
now
we
know
the
players
are
different
but
their
relationships
with
their
clubs
maybe
different
as
well.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
it's
feature
of
the
same
thing,
an
aspect
of
the
same.
there
is
a
wide
range
obviously
of
talent,
of
desire
and
that's
felt
-–
that's
expressed
more
appropriately
realized
in
individual
bargaining.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
well,
your
honor--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
we
don't
think
it
will
be
practical
to
have
a
different
reserve
system
for
each
individual
player,
such
as
you
can't
differentiate
salaries.
but
that
does
not
mean
that
a
reserve
system
must
necessarily,
monolithically
apply
to
all
players.
there
could
be
a
small
number
of
variations
in
the
reserve
system,
again
depending
upon
seniority
or
some
other
factor.
those
kinds
of
suggestions
have
been
made
and
they
certainly
will
continue
to
be
on
the
table.
but
an
individual
reserve
system
for
each
player
having
not
negotiated
out
separately
is
little
difficult
to
understand.
i
think
that
would
not
be
workable.
that's
not
to
say
that
individual
players
and
clubs
can
not
negotiate
such
things
as
long
term
contracts
and
so
on
which
go
a
long
way
toward
modifying
the
reserve
system.
that
can
be
done
and
has
been
done.
and
that
any
player
is
free
to
do
with
his
club.
there
is
certain
precedent
for
that
one.
your
honor
i'd
like
to
briefly
refer
you
to
jewel
tea
and
pennington
decisions
which
mr.
justice
goldberg
referred
to.
as
i
--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
but
we
certainly
would
not
do
that
your
honor.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
not
one
that
we
have
suggested
your
honor.
that
would
be
something
that
we
would
have
to,
i
believe
state
a
maximum,
like
state
a
minimum.
there
is
something
that
we
have
taken
up
with
the
players
association
and
bargain.
if
the
association
were
to
say,
no
we
don't
care
to
bargain--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
i
think
it
would
improper
your
honor.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
no,
not
all
your
honor,
improper
in
terms
of
the
labor
laws.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
if
this
were
put
aside
as
a
bargaining
issue,
you
can't
make
something
that
is
not
a
bargaining
issue,
which
you
can
agree
not
to
bargain
about
it.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
we
had
agreed
not
to
bargain
about
it
and
the
union
thereby
would
have
acquiesced
in
our
setting
such
maximums.
and
i
believe
we
will
be
permitted
to
do
so.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
because
of
the
labor
exemption,
because
of
the
union
acquiescence.
but
the
union
could
challenge
that,
put
it
on
the
bargaining
table
and
at
any
time
if
disputed.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
that
goes
without
saying
your
honor.
that
goes
without
saying.
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
if
i
may
briefly
to
a
matter
not
mentioned
in
our
briefs
simply
because
it
has
not
been
published
by
that
time,
that
is
a
yale
law
journal
article
by
professor
wiener
and
mr.
jacob's
title
antitrust
principles
and
collective
bargaining
by
athletes
in
81
yale
law
journal
number
one,
which
agrees
completely
i
believe
with
the
analysis
which
we've
advanced
in
our
brief
and
suggests
that
the
antitrust
issues
are
perhaps
even
irrelevant
here.
the
labor
policy
and
its
supervening.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
your
honor
i'm
suggesting
that
the
judgment
;
number
one,
that
the
judgment
below
be
upheld
on
the
grounds
reached
below,
but
alternatively
that
there
is
an
additional,
powerful
and
we
think
quite
correct
ground,
which
the
courts
below
felt
that
not
necessary
to
reach
to
a
labor
policy
which
offers
an
alternative
reason
for
--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
i
think
the
record
is
quite
adequate.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
your
honor
i
think
it
would
not
be
inappropriate
to
remand
that
for
such
findings
as
you
might
feel
that
would
be
appropriate
or
not
inconsistent
with
your
opinion.
i
do
believe
the
record
has
been
fully
developed
on
that
point
however.
i
would
mention
only
briefly
that
the
law
which
congress
has
decided
is
one
which
i'm
sure
you're
aware
and
i
will
elaborate
the
point.
congress
has
accepted
the
invitation
of
this
court
repeatedly
given
as
examined
the
baseball
system
repeatedly.
many
bills
have
been
introduced,
many
hearings
held.
the
conclusions
of
those
committee
reports
universally
within
the
effect
that
the
baseballs
reserve
system
was
something
that
was
of
that
substance
of
the
game
and
it
was
needed
to
be
preserved.
whenever
congress
has
acted,
it
has
extended
an
antitrust
exemption.
it
has
never
in
any
way
limited
one
in
professional
sports.
the
matter
is
now
under
active
consideration
by
congress
which
has
flexible
legislative
power.
it's
not
limited
to
applying
only
the
garden-variety
antitrust
laws.
it
can
root
out
evils
as
it
sees
them
with
its
flexible
legislative
power
and
deal
with
them
quite
precisely.
and
if
there
is
any
regulatory
policy
governmental
regulatory
policy
of
baseball
should
be
adopted
and
congress
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
observed
is
the
proper
body
for
adopting
that.
i
would
like
to
mention
as
well
that
the
talk
of
stare
decisis,
as
this
court
has
said
the
last
word
on
stare
decisis
in
the
toolson
and
radovich
opinions,
again
i
need
not
repeat
what
this
court
had
said,
except
the
note
that
the
baseball
community
has
continued
to
operate
under
those
rules,
grown
and
invested
more
and
that
others
reliance
interest
recognized
in
the
50s
or
have
multiplied
or
even
greater
weight
now.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
counsel
for
the
national
league
and
i
here
represent
the
24
major
league
clubs
and
the
two
major
leagues.
the
issues
presented
here
are--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
no,
it's
not
my
position
that
baseball
is
not
commerce
your
honor.
i
think
that
has
been
well
recognized.
indeed
it
is
recognized
by
the
toolson
decision.
the
issues
are
here
much
broader
than
curt
flood’s
particular
situation
which
has
been
described
by
mr.
justice
goldberg.
this
is
fundamentally
in
our
view
institutional
litigation
concerting
the
normal
operation
of
baseball’s
basic
fundamental
and
historic
rules.
and
the
real
protagonists
here
are
suggested
by
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
few
moments
ago.
the
real
protagonists
are
the
players
union,
the
major
league
baseball
players
association
and
the
major
league
clubs
that
i
represent--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
the
record
shows
in
very
great
detail
your
honor
as
does
the
opinion
of
judge
cooper
devoted
a
good
portion
of
his
opinion
to
tracing
the
effectiveness
of
bargaining,
the
effectiveness
of
the
union--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
yes
all
of
the
players
in
major
league
baseball
really
are
members
of
players
association.
they
have
been
association
that
has
been
recognized
by
the
clubs
as
the
formal
collective
bargaining
agent
for
the
football
players.
and
all
of
the
terms
and
condition
of
employment
of
a
major
league
baseball
player
are
in
fact
on
the
table
on
a
more
or
less
constant
basis
--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
well.
there
has
been
no
dispute
over
the
propriety
of
their
representation.
however
there
have
been
a
couple
of
unfair
labor
practice
charges
that
have
been
brought
and
processed
by
the
nlrb,
and
the
nlrb
of
course
asserted
jurisdiction
and
that
point
is
not
debated
by
either
side.
it's
part
of
the
workings
of
major
league
baseball
as
we
know
it
today
have
known
it
for
sometime.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
no,
i
was
referring
to
proceedings
involved
in
the
major
league
baseball
players
association.
some
of
the
dispute
at
the
beginning
of
this
year
on
the
question
of
the
relationship
between
television
revenues
and
bargain
on
the
pension
plan.
there
was
a
disputes
as
to
the
extent
to
which
we
were
required
to
disclose
certain
information.
nlrb
involved
itself
in
working
that
matter
out,
complaint
was
issued
and
so
forth.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
it's
a
player
for
minor
league
player?
your
honor,
i
would
not
be
able
to
say
to
you
that
bargaining
directly
representing
the
minor
league
players
was
being
carried
on,
but
the
major
league
baseball
players
association
certainly
has
bargained
with
the
interest
of
the
minor
league
players
in
mind.
indeed
many
of
the
grievances
that
have
been
brought
before.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
bargaining
with
the
minor
league
players
directly?
no,
there
is
no
direct
formal
representation
by
the
minor
league
players.
that
does
not
mean
they
are
unrepresented
however,
i
suggest
that
their
interest
as
part
of
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
well
at
my
position
would
be
the
same
your
honor.
i
simply
would
not
be
able
to
point
to
the
direct
one
to
one
relationship
between
a
formal
bargaining
representative
and
with
that
particular
players
i
can
with
the
mr.
flood,
it
was
clearly
represented
and
a
member
of
the
organization
but
i
would
still
argue
your
honor
even
if
the
minor
league
player
--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
i
mean,
as
far
as
the
assignment
of
flood's
contract?
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
no
that
contract
assignment
took
place
under
the
rules
which
themselves
were
the
subject
to
bargaining.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
well,
no
one--.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
i
call
it
union
your
honor.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
the
union
after
the
transaction
took
place,
conferred
with
mr.
flood
as
i
understand
it
and
ultimately
agreed
with
him
to
finance
the
cost
of
his
litigation
and
as
i
was
about
to
point
out,
it
is
quite
transparent
i
believe
from
the
reading
of
the
record
that
the
players
association,
the
players
union
has
in
fact
controlled
this
litigation
from
beginning
to
end.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
we
certainly
are
interested
in
not
litigating
your
honor,
we
believe
that--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
well,
when
the
law
suit
--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
no
representations
by
the
union
were
made
to
us
--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
seeking
any
--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
your
honor,
i
believe
it
is
during
the
pendency
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
these
rules
were
part
of
an
arrangement
and
bargaining
was
not
to
take
place
until
a
subsequent
period.
the
transfer
was
entirely
in
accord
because
of
arrangements.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
your
honor
i
don't
believe
the
unions
ever
agreed
to
that.
i
don't
think
that
what
happened
with
mr.
flood.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
the
reserve
system
is
not
simply
a
paragraph
but
a
number
of
inter-related
rules--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
i
believe
that's
right
your
honor
–
i
beg
your
pardon,
with
the
management.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
well,
your
honor
there
are
the
collective
bargain
agreements
in
the
record.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
your
honor,
a
collectively
bargained
agreement
is
an
agreement
signed
obviously
by
the
union
and
by
management
and
all
of
the
major
league
rules
where
encompassed
by
that
agreement.
i
can't
think
of
a
plainer
way
to
demonstrate
it.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
well,
the
union
your
honor
is
i
think
having
participated
in
the
bargaining
on
management
side
for
the
last
several
years,
has
made
remarkable
gains
with
respect
to
player
club
relationships.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
well
the
union
is
--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
no,
i
would
not
say
nothing.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
no,
i
certainly
would
not
say
that.
i
would
say
that
the
reserve
clause
itself,
the
very
core
of
the
reserve
clause
is
a
subject
admitted
by
both
sides,
a
mandatory
subject
of
bargaining
and
something
about
which
bargaining
was
going
on
when
interrupted
by
the
pendency
the
filing
of
this
lawsuit.
and
it
is
back
to
that
form
your
honor
that
we
believe
this
matter
should
be
remitted.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
back
to
the
collective
bargaining
table.
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
well
the
union
is
protecting
the
individual.
your
honor,
this
union
is
very
well.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
your
honor,
the
union
bargains
obviously
for
future
benefits
and
what's
at
stake
here
is
the
shape
of
baseball
and
its
employee
relations
really
for
the
future.
mr.
flood
is
--
i
think
there
is
no
question
about
that.
he
is
retired
from
baseball
now.
he
is
through
with
baseball
he
--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
well,
i
would
call
it
voluntarily
retired
at
this
point,
your
honor.
he
was
playing
for
washington
and
felt
that
he
no
longer
could
play
satisfactory
to
his
standards
and
he
had
other
problems
as
well
and
he
left
the
country.
we
were
most
eager
to
have
the
employee
during
the
pendency
of
this
lawsuit.
we
told
his
counsel
repeatedly
that
we
would
make
no
argument
whatsoever
that
the
case
had
been
mooted
and
that
we
wanted
to
see
curt
flood
playing
and
living
his
normal
life
and
litigation
could
go
forward.
if
they
would
not
hear
one
word
from
us
that
there
was
something
inconsistent
about
him
playing
and
litigating.
we
made
no
threats.
it
was
suggested
constantly
that
this
be
done
and
in
1971
curt
flood
decided
he
would
return
to
baseball.
his
play
was
of
the
caliber
that
as
a
proud
man,
his
play
was
of
the
caliber
that
was
not
satisfactory
to
him.
he
had
other
financial
business
problems
which
caused
him
to
leave
to
both
the
washington
area
and
the
united
states.
we
regretted
that
very
much.
we
would
have
been
delighted
to
see
mr.
flood
continue
a
long
and
prosperous
career.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
none
of
which
is
in
the
record
your
honor.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
well,
the
record
was
closed
before
he
began
to
play
for
washington
your
honor,
yes.
i
think
that
justice
goldberg
adverted
to
it
and
i
am
sure
you
could
take
notice
of
that
fact.
as
i
had
mentioned
before,
it
is
our
position
that
the
players
union
is
entirely
in
control
of
this
litigation,
and
that
it
is
concerned
less
with
remedying
any
alleged
wrong
that
may
have
been
performed
on
mr.
flood,
that
it
is
trying
to
reorganize
the
employment
relationships
in
professional
baseball.
in
other
words,
the
union
is
after
a
larger
game
here.
mr.
flood's
testimony
itself
was
isolated
from
the
rest
of
the
case
presented,
on
behalf
of
petitioner.
he
testified
that
he
would
like
the
entire
system
to
be
torn
apart,
and
like
every
ball
player
to
be
free
to
negotiate
with
any
club
of
his
choice.
while
all
of
the
other
witnesses
testified
on
behalf
of
petitioner,
limited
their
testimony
to
certain
modifications,
that
they
suggested
in
a
reserve
system.
all
assuming
that
some
continuity
of
player
control,
some
form
of
player
reserve
system
would
in
fact
be
necessary.
this
testimony
represented
a
repudiation
of
really
mr.
flood's
position,
and
left
him
a
forgotten
him
for
the
reminder
of
the
case.
in
fact
no
evidence
at
all
was
offered
on
the
damages,
which
mr.
flood's
complaint
indicated
he
had
suffered
to
his
outside
business
interest
in
st.
louis,
not
a
shred
of
it
was
ever
offered
on
that
matter.
that's
the
union
as
i
have
said,
was
after
a
larger
game.
it
intended
to
subvert
the
collective
bargaining
process
in
baseball
to
obtain
games
which
it
had
not
yet
achieved
at
the
bargaining
table,
outside
of
the
bargaining
table,
and
to
unravel
the
very
fabric
of
past
collecting
bargaining,
all
of
which
interwoven
intimately
with
the
reserve
system.
in
order
to
accomplish
this
purpose,
the
petitioner
has
attempted
to
persuade
this
court
to
move
radically
in
two
new
directions.
first
to
change
the
law
abruptly
and
totally,
by
overruling
the
narrow
and
well
confined
precedents
of
long
standing,
which
now
indicate
that
baseball
is
not
subjected
to
the
antitrust
laws.
and
second
to
declare
illegal,
per
se
illegal,
i
believe
according
to
their
briefs,
baseball's
historical
reserve
system
as
the
trial
court
found
the
corner
stone
of
the
game,
and
to
act
in
effect
as
a
compulsory
arbitrator
in
an
employee-employer
dispute,
about
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
in
baseball,
in
fashioning
a
new
system.
a
trial
was
demanded
to
--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
your
honor,
the
adaption
of
the
draft
system
is
simply
one
more
step,
and
a
number
of
steps
that
baseball
had
taken
over
a
period
of
years
to
try
to
equalize
competition
on
a
playing
field,
preceding
the
draft
rule
there
were
rules
about
bonus
issue,
you
may
remember
this.
if
a
bonus
of
a
certain
size
was
awarded
to
a
player,
that
player
must
serve
immediately
on
a
major
league
roster.
all
of
these
were
efforts
to
prevent
the
clubs
with
the
largest
accumulations
of
wealth
in
being
able
to
attract
the
most
skillful
young
ball
player,
and
none
of
those
system
soon
--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
well
i
think
the
first
bonuses
were
probably
of
large
amount
were
paid
in
50s.
sometime
before
the
rule
or
the
65
free
agent
draft,
i
might
note
on
the
free
agent
draft
subject
that
all
of
the
other
sports
have
free
agent
drafts.
in
fact,
in
the
other
sports
the
rights
to
negotiate
with
a
player
are
perpetual.
once
he
is
--
an
amateur
is
drafted,
he
can
negotiate
only
during
his
lifetime,
with
the
club
that
drafted
him,
and
in
baseball
the
negotiating
rights
are
only
of
6
months
duration,
and
if
a
player
doesn't
sign
with
the
club
that
drafted
him,
he
maybe
reselected
by
another
club.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
well,
your
honor,
there
are
number
of
differences
in
the
employment
relationship
between
football,
and
baseball,
and
a
number
of
differences
in
the
sport,
the
character
of
the
sport
themselves.
an
obvious
difference
that
receives
much
publicity
is
the
option
rule
in
professional
football.
a
system
by
which
a
player
can
declare
at
the
beginning
of
the
season
that
he
desires
to
move
to
another
pastures
at
the
end
of
that
season,
he
then
plays
an
option
--
they
call
like
it
the
(inaudible)
option.
at
the
end
of
that
additional
year,
he
is
technically
free
to
seek
employment
by
another
club.
the
rule
has
another
provision
that
says
that
any
other
club
that
signs
that
player
must
compensate
to
the
club
from
which
the
player
came,
either
in
the
amount
measured
by
money
players,
draft
choices,
what
have
you,
satisfactory
to
that
former
club
or
if
a
new
agreement
can
be
reached,
that
the
commissioner
will
establish
compensation.
the
major
league
baseball
players
association
is
announced
this
arrangement
as
essentially
a
fraudulent
one,
and
in
fact
there's
been
a
little
mobility
historically
in
football,
and
if
one
examines
the
collective
bargaining
process
going
on
in
football,
one
will
see
that
the
football
players
themselves
denounced
the
arrangement
as
being
essentially
a
cosmetic
one,
and
not
one
affords
them
any
real
freedom
of
choice
and
then
seeking
their
employment.
other
differences
in
employment
relationship
in
football,
and
baseball,
rather
than
football,
the
management
may
establish
the
rules
of
the
game.
in
baseball
our
collective
bargaining
agreement
expressly
recognizes
the
duty
of
the
major
league
clubs
before
enacting
any
rule
or
involving
in
any
way,
player
benefits
or
player
rights
to
negotiate
that
rule
with
the
players.
also
in
baseball,
there
is
an
grievance
procedure
which
has
been
agreed
to
with
the
players
association,
one
that’s
un-parallel
by
any
other
sport
which
places
all
grievances
about
club
and
player
matters
except
those
involve
the
integrity,
which
are
reserved
for
the
commissioner
but
the
garden-variety
grievance
goes
before,
an
arbitrator
external
to
the
game,
a
man
now
named
lewis
gill
former
president
of
the
american
academy
of
arbitrators
jointly
selected
by
the
union
and
by
the
clubs.
he
has
handled
dozens
of
grievances
in
baseball,
makes
final
and
un-appealable
decisions
with
respect
to
them.
and
finally
with
respect
to
the
differences
in
the
character
of
the
game,
games
themselves
football
for
example,
and
baseball,
football
is
able
to
reach
out
and
plug
from
the
college
campuses
players
are
ready
to
play
professional
football,
already
nationally
known
and
skilled.
baseball
has
no
such
alternative,
baseball
has
an
elaborate
minor
league
system,
in
which
it
develop
its
own
players,
and
to
which
it
devotes
approximately
25%
of
the
major
league
gross
revenues.
something
over
a
million
dollars
per
year
per
club,
poured
into
the
minor
leagues
to
keep
the
flow
of
players,
to
keep
this
player
development
flow
operating.
there
isn't
any
sport,
any
professional
sport,
that
has
anything
that
even
proximates
that
sort
of
an
arrangement,
or
those
sort
of
expenses
and
difficulties
of
player
development.
for
all
these
reasons,
we
believe
and
the
players
association
recognizes
and
they're
bargaining
with
us,
that
the
experience
in
other
sports
is,
well
not
dissimilar
from
baseball's
really,
nevertheless
neither
is
it
a
good
guide
for
the
baseball
world.
there
are
important
differences
in
the
businesses
and
we
feel
and
as
i've
said
the
players
union
feels
too
that
we
must
work
out
our
own
relationships
in
the
light
of
realities
of
the
baseball
business,
not
in
the
light
of
what
some
other
sport
may
do,
or
some
arid
principles,
but
on
the
practical
level,
at
the
bargaining
table,
by
the
people
who
must
live
with
results
of
their
labors,
the
players
and
the
club
owners.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
you're
expressing
a
fact
your
honor.
your
honor
bargaining
had
just
begun
in
the
core
of
the
reserve
system
and
like
any
labor
union
they
think
they
see
an
easy
way
to
achieve
a
position
of
predominance,
a
better
position,
more
clogged
at
the
bargaining
table,
they
seize
the
opportunity.
i
think
there
is
little
doubt,
but
what
the
owner's
position
here
would
be
in
something
of
the
shambles.
if
this
court
would
rule
that
the
reserve
system
is
per
se
illegal.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
don't
know
how
bargaining
could
proceed
at
all.
i
don't
know
what
what
we
would
do
at
the
bargaining
table
because
presumably,
not
only
the
present
system
but
every
modification
there
too,
everything
that
we
might
have
work
out
in
this
area
with
the
union
would
be
forbidden
by
the
antitrust
laws.
and
even
if
only
our
present
system,
not
speaking
of
other
systems
were
to
be
declared
illegal,
still
there
would
be
a
third
party
at
the
bargaining
table
and
that
would
be
the
court
and
the
players
union
i
think
would
be
able
to
use
that
extremely
effectively.
we
would
been
buying
a
new
reserve
system
every
time
we
bargained
and
that
the
option
would
be
that
we
would
be
faced
with
more
litigation
and
wrapped
with
certainty,
that
probability
that
the
arrangements
would
be
illegal
without
their
acquiescence.
i
think
this
kind
of
intrusion
into
a
collective
bargaining
process
is
not
something
that
the
courts
commonly
do.
it's
something
that's
quite
inconsistent.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
only
factual
issues
presented
here,
obviously
the
broader
issue
is
toolson
exemption
which
we
believe
reaches
to
the
entire
structure
of
the
game,
not
only
reserve
system.
but
mr.
flood
and
the
union
here
are
complaining
only
about
the
reserve
system
and
--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
it's
quite
right
your
honor,
but
i
think
there
are
other
levels
of
decision
here
too,
the
labor
matter
that
we're
discussing
that
i'm
now
arguing,
that's
not
--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
that's
right
your
honor.
it's
a
separate
distinct
reason
for
the
use
of
result
as
well.
i
might
also
comment
as
in
--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
yes,
i
presume
we
could
also
lose
the
issue
here
on
broad
coverage
and
prevail
on
the
issue
that
no
suit
can
appropriately
be
brought
by
member
of
the
collective
bargaining
organization
and
matter
which
is
essentially
a
matter
of
collective
bargaining.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
no
your
honor
i
don't.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
no,
the
union
has
expressed
in
its
dealing
to
the
best
that
it
does
not
wish
to
bargain
except
to
set
minimums
and
other
parameters.
it
is
suggested
that
we
would
like
to
bargain
perhaps
not
only
by
minimums
--
at
flow,
but
but
perhaps
the
minimums
that
relate
to
some
very
seniority
levels
as
well,
but
it
does
not
wish
to
intrude
in
the
individual
negotiations
in
the
contract--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
that's
right
your
honor,
but
the
range
of
--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
it
certainly
could
your
honor.
that
would
be
a
mandatory
subject
if
the
union
were
to
raise
--
put
that
issue
on
the
bargaining
table,
we
would
have
no
choice
but
to
deal
with
it.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
we
would
have
put
it
on
the
bargaining
table
as
well.
i
think
both
sides
today
have
felt
that
it
is
not
in
the
interest
of
the
individual
players
or
off
the
process
to
--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
i
think
that
that
is
part
of
the
answer
your
honor,
yes.
it's
part
of
the
answer.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
well,
i
think
that
rest
of
the
answer
is
that
now
we
know
the
players
are
different
but
their
relationships
with
their
clubs
maybe
different
as
well.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
it's
feature
of
the
same
thing,
an
aspect
of
the
same.
there
is
a
wide
range
obviously
of
talent,
of
desire
and
that's
felt
-–
that's
expressed
more
appropriately
realized
in
individual
bargaining.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
well,
your
honor--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
we
don't
think
it
will
be
practical
to
have
a
different
reserve
system
for
each
individual
player,
such
as
you
can't
differentiate
salaries.
but
that
does
not
mean
that
a
reserve
system
must
necessarily,
monolithically
apply
to
all
players.
there
could
be
a
small
number
of
variations
in
the
reserve
system,
again
depending
upon
seniority
or
some
other
factor.
those
kinds
of
suggestions
have
been
made
and
they
certainly
will
continue
to
be
on
the
table.
but
an
individual
reserve
system
for
each
player
having
not
negotiated
out
separately
is
little
difficult
to
understand.
i
think
that
would
not
be
workable.
that's
not
to
say
that
individual
players
and
clubs
can
not
negotiate
such
things
as
long
term
contracts
and
so
on
which
go
a
long
way
toward
modifying
the
reserve
system.
that
can
be
done
and
has
been
done.
and
that
any
player
is
free
to
do
with
his
club.
there
is
certain
precedent
for
that
one.
your
honor
i'd
like
to
briefly
refer
you
to
jewel
tea
and
pennington
decisions
which
mr.
justice
goldberg
referred
to.
as
i
--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
but
we
certainly
would
not
do
that
your
honor.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
not
one
that
we
have
suggested
your
honor.
that
would
be
something
that
we
would
have
to,
i
believe
state
a
maximum,
like
state
a
minimum.
there
is
something
that
we
have
taken
up
with
the
players
association
and
bargain.
if
the
association
were
to
say,
no
we
don't
care
to
bargain--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
i
think
it
would
improper
your
honor.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
no,
not
all
your
honor,
improper
in
terms
of
the
labor
laws.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
if
this
were
put
aside
as
a
bargaining
issue,
you
can't
make
something
that
is
not
a
bargaining
issue,
which
you
can
agree
not
to
bargain
about
it.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
we
had
agreed
not
to
bargain
about
it
and
the
union
thereby
would
have
acquiesced
in
our
setting
such
maximums.
and
i
believe
we
will
be
permitted
to
do
so.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
because
of
the
labor
exemption,
because
of
the
union
acquiescence.
but
the
union
could
challenge
that,
put
it
on
the
bargaining
table
and
at
any
time
if
disputed.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
that
goes
without
saying
your
honor.
that
goes
without
saying.
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
if
i
may
briefly
to
a
matter
not
mentioned
in
our
briefs
simply
because
it
has
not
been
published
by
that
time,
that
is
a
yale
law
journal
article
by
professor
wiener
and
mr.
jacob's
title
antitrust
principles
and
collective
bargaining
by
athletes
in
81
yale
law
journal
number
one,
which
agrees
completely
i
believe
with
the
analysis
which
we've
advanced
in
our
brief
and
suggests
that
the
antitrust
issues
are
perhaps
even
irrelevant
here.
the
labor
policy
and
its
supervening.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
your
honor
i'm
suggesting
that
the
judgment
;
number
one,
that
the
judgment
below
be
upheld
on
the
grounds
reached
below,
but
alternatively
that
there
is
an
additional,
powerful
and
we
think
quite
correct
ground,
which
the
courts
below
felt
that
not
necessary
to
reach
to
a
labor
policy
which
offers
an
alternative
reason
for
--
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
i
think
the
record
is
quite
adequate.
mr.
louis
f.
hoynes
jr.
your
honor
i
think
it
would
not
be
inappropriate
to
remand
that
for
such
findings
as
you
might
feel
that
would
be
appropriate
or
not
inconsistent
with
your
opinion.
i
do
believe
the
record
has
been
fully
developed
on
that
point
however.
i
would
mention
only
briefly
that
the
law
which
congress
has
decided
is
one
which
i'm
sure
you're
aware
and
i
will
elaborate
the
point.
congress
has
accepted
the
invitation
of
this
court
repeatedly
given
as
examined
the
baseball
system
repeatedly.
many
bills
have
been
introduced,
many
hearings
held.
the
conclusions
of
those
committee
reports
universally
within
the
effect
that
the
baseballs
reserve
system
was
something
that
was
of
that
substance
of
the
game
and
it
was
needed
to
be
preserved.
whenever
congress
has
acted,
it
has
extended
an
antitrust
exemption.
it
has
never
in
any
way
limited
one
in
professional
sports.
the
matter
is
now
under
active
consideration
by
congress
which
has
flexible
legislative
power.
it's
not
limited
to
applying
only
the
garden-variety
antitrust
laws.
it
can
root
out
evils
as
it
sees
them
with
its
flexible
legislative
power
and
deal
with
them
quite
precisely.
and
if
there
is
any
regulatory
policy
governmental
regulatory
policy
of
baseball
should
be
adopted
and
congress
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
observed
is
the
proper
body
for
adopting
that.
i
would
like
to
mention
as
well
that
the
talk
of
stare
decisis,
as
this
court
has
said
the
last
word
on
stare
decisis
in
the
toolson
and
radovich
opinions,
again
i
need
not
repeat
what
this
court
had
said,
except
the
note
that
the
baseball
community
has
continued
to
operate
under
those
rules,
grown
and
invested
more
and
that
others
reliance
interest
recognized
in
the
50s
or
have
multiplied
or
even
greater
weight
now.
thank
you
your
honor.
