chief

e.

is
it
possible,
you

clear
this
up
as
you

along,
is
it
possible
that
the
information
about
this
prior
record
came
to
the
attention
of
the
court,
the
second
court
involved
in
de
novo
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
going
to
save
sometime
to
tell
is
why
there
is
not
any
case
here

the
mootness
upon

you
raised?
have

yes.
chief

warren
e.

fourth
circuit,
would
that
solve
your
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.

but
that
is,
then
you
want
us
to
give

advisory
opinion?
chief

you
may
continue,
complete
the
sentence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
alstyne.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
the
point
that
has
been
raised
on
whether
the
superior
court
information
about
the
man’s
prior
record
is
available
which
was
not
in
the
record
of
the
first
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
a
date
on
that
sheet?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
possible
that
one
response
to
what
circuit
holding
if
it
stands
would
be
for
all
of
the
sentences
in
the
first
court,
now,
the
district
court,
to
be
the
maximum?
chief

warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
remedy
that
pearce
prescribes
for
the
enhanced
sentence
on
the
second
time
around?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
my
question
is
when
they
find
the
sentence,
why
not
merit
it
under
pearce?
what
is
the
remedy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
did
not
read
like
a
clerical
error
to
me
mr.
alstyne
and
you
think
it
is
just
an
oversight?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
which
is
the
language
that
led
merely
down
the
other
road?
i
am
reading
from
the
opinion.
“rice
is
not
to
be
held
to
his
conviction
which
means
the
conviction
is
set
aside,
now
is
that
the
remedy
prescribed
by
pearce?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
then,
this
is
not
a
clerical
error,
but
a
judicial
error,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
percentage
of
all
the
cases
are
in
forma
pauperis
to
the
district
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
do
you
not
think
it
might
be
substantial
like
90%?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
after
the
guilty
plea
derived
that
hypothetical
case
that
mr.
justice
white
suggested,
the
man
then
asserts
his
right
to
a
trial
de
novo,
is
his
guilty
plea
under
the
north
carolina
law
admissible
in
evidence
against
him
in
the
new
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
see
a
constitutional
question
if
it
developed
on
a
survey
that
every
judge
in
every
case
in
the
district
court
imposed
the
maximum
sentence
on
that
in
a
given
percentage,
10%
or
15%,
they
later
entertained
motions
for
modification
of
the
sentence
and
did
reduce
the
sentence?
chief

is
there
due
process
question
there
too?
