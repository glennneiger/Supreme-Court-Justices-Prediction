mr.
jacob
l.
safron
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
this
court
upon
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
which
held
in
rice
versus
north
carolina
that
upon
the
strength
of
pearce,
the
imposition
of
a
greater
sentence
is
impermissible
in
a
situation
in
which
a
defendant
receives
a
trial
de
novo
in
the
superior
court
from
a
lower
criminal
court.
and
that
was
the
legal
conclusion
without
the
courts
giving
any
legal
reasoning.
the
course
then
went
on
to
stage
in
reference
to
all
the
cases
to
the
contrary,
but
they
simply
disagreed
and
ordered
the
state
of
north
carolina
to
expunge
any
record
of
mr.
rice’s
conviction
in
the
buncombe
county
superior
court.
wayne
claude
rice
was
originally
arrested
on
july
2,
1968
for
driving
under
the
influence
of
alcohol.
on
july
19,
1968,
he
was
tried
in
the
buncombe
county
court
which
was
then
in
existence
and
received
a
sentence
of
a
nine-month
sentence
suspended
upon
payment
of
a
fine
of
$100.00
and
costs.
as
was
his
absolute
right,
he
applied
for
a
trial
de
novo
in
the
buncombe
county
superior
court.
on
august
2,
his
right
to
trial
de
novo
was
assured
and
on
that
day
he
first
pled
guilty
to
twelve
offenses
of
uttering
worthless
checks
and
then
was
tried
upon
his
plea
of
not
guilty
on
the
charge
of
driving
under
the
influence.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
only
in
this
regard,
your
honor.
there
were
these
twelve
worthless
check
charges.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
he
pled
guilty
to
those,
was
then
tried
upon
the
plea
of
not
guilty
as
driving
under
the
influence.
the
sentence
or
the
sentences
that
were
then
imposed,
he
received
a
two-year
active
sentence
for
driving
under
the
influence,
the
maximum
then
permitted
under
the
law,
but
the
same
time
when
the
judge
sentenced
him
as
to
the
worthless
check
charges,
he
was
sentenced
to
the
consecutive
one-month
sentences
to
run
concurrently
with
the
sentence
imposed
for
driving
under
the
influence.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
your
honor.
it
was
concurrent
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
not
except
for
--
to
the
first
year
of
the
sentences
were
concurrent
whereas
the
court
could
have
imposed
the
sentence
consecutively,
it
was
imposed
concurrently
and
he
received
no
greater
sentence
as
result
of
having
pled
guilty
to
the
twelve
worthless
check
charges.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes
your
honor,
that
is
true.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
his
original
sentence
was
nine
months
suspended
upon
payment
of
$100.00
fine
and
costs.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
oh
yes,
your
honor,
quite
clear!
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
not
at
all.
in
fact
concurrent
sentence,
your
honor,
i
believe
is
merely
something
applies
to
the
federal
judiciary
and
it
is
not
applicable
to
the
states.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
with
all
something
separate
and
apart,
your
honor.
he
received
twelve,
there
were
twelve
warrants
in
the
county
court
at
this
stage
from
january
of
that
year.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
your
honor,
he
applied
for
trial
de
novo
in
these
cases
and
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
before
whom
he
appeared
in
a
driving
under
the
influence,
your
honor?
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i
have
no
idea.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
only
this
respect,
your
honor,
on
the
same
day
when
his
trial
de
novo
for
the
worthless
checks
came
up
for
hearing,
he
also
was
on
for
hearing
for
his
drunk
driving
charge.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
oh
yes,
your
honor,
these
are
all
de
novo.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
it
defends,
your
honor,
upon
the
amount.
at
the
present
time
if
it
does
not
exceed
$50.00,
the
maximum
is
thirty
days.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
apparently
so,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
every
petty
offense,
your
honor.
the
right
to
trial
de
novo
is
an
absolute
right
granted
in
the
north
carolina
constitution.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
your
honor,
for
every
offense
which
is
originally
tried
in
what
are
now
say
the
district
court.
this
could
be
and
ordinance
violation
or
could
be
an
overtime
parking
ticket,
traffic
violation
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
in
the
district
court,
your
honor
or
perhaps
let
me
express
the
other
way.
the
original
jurisdiction
of
the
superior
court
is
only
applicable
to
felonies.
all
other
offenses,
the
district
court
has
original
jurisdiction,
that
is
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
there
is
no
right
to
trial
by
jury
in
the
district
court
your
honor,
criminal
matters.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
that
is
exactly
right,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
oh
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
oh
yes,
your
honor.
they
were
tried
in
what
was
in
the
county
court
and
--
what
your
honor?
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
your
honor
and
then
he
appealed
and
pled
guilty.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i
am
really
not
sure
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
your
honor.
i
believe
it
was
the
same
but
i
am
really
not
sure.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
your
honor.
this
gentleman
has
a
record
dating
back
to
1948.
i
have
here
the
so-called
fbi
wrap
sheet.
it
starts
in
1948
and
he
has
spent
more
time
in
custody.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
your
honor.
in
1962
he
was
convicted
of
escape,
temporary
larceny
of
automobile,
larceny
of
an
automobile
and
drunk
driving.
this
was
not
his
first.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
your
honor,
i
would
say
this.
unfortunately,
the
district
courts
are
the
courts
of
original
jurisdiction.
this
is
where
the
great
mass
of
cases
are
tried.
the
felony
cases
are
only
minuscule
part
of
the
total
case
load
in
the
criminal
judicial
system
and
unfortunately
in
the
district
courts,
the
district
court
judge
does
not
have
made
available
to
him,
all
the
resources
which
are
available
in
the
superior
court.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
this
is
a
misstatement,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
oh!
we
are
talking
now
your
honor
of
nine
months
of
driving
with
the
influence,
30
days
was
the
bad
check
charge.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
your
honor.
there
is
a
problem
involved
here
due
to
the
fact
that
the
sentence
for
driving
under
the
influence
was
amended
subsequent
to
mr.
rice’s
trial.
whether
or
not
that
amendment
in
the
statute
and
the
downgrading
of
the
maximum
should
be
part
of
the
issue
here,
i
am
merely
not
sure.
the
maximum
now
i
believe
is
six
months
for
first
offense
driving
under
the
influence.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
he
received
nine
months
at
the
time
when
two
years
was
a
permissible
maximum,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
your
honor,
at
that
time
the
statute
permitted
up
to
two
years
for
first
offense
driving
under
the
influence.
he
did
receive
the
first,
the
maximum,
but
this
is
bogging
the
issue
because
of
subsequent
legislative
down
grading
of
the
maximum
sentence.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
but
since
i
have
this
here,
i
just
want
to
point
out
that
since
1948,
mr.
rice
spent
more
time
in
custody
than
he
has
out
of
custody.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
there
is
an
absolute
right
to
trial
de
novo
in
the
state
of
north
carolina,
your
honor.
it
does
not
matter
whether
or
not
the
defendant
pled
guilty
or
not
guilty.
if
he
pleads
guilty
and
is
not
satisfied
with
the
sentence
that
is
imposed,
he
can
apply
for
trial
de
novo
that
wipes
the
entire
proceeding
clean.
it
is
completely
off
the
record
and
he
will
then
have
an
opportunity
for
a
jury
trial
in
a
superior
court
as
if
nothing
had
ever
happened
before.
i
just
have
been
advised
that
according
to
mr.
rice’s
prison
jacket
he
received
the
same
sentence
in
the
superior
court
as
he
had
received
in
the
county
court
upon
the
worthless
check
charges.
now,
subsequent
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
your
honor,
i
am
confident
that
upon
his
trial
in
superior
court
which
was
then
the
responsibility
of
the
solicitor
to
a
full
jury
trial
that
this
information
was
obtained.
now,
i
am
familiar
with
procedures
in
the
district
court,
previously
the
county
courts.
the
only
record
available
to
the
judge
at
the
time
is
they
listed
a
man's
convictions
in
that
particular
court.
the
court
does
not
have
available
to
it
due
to
the
tremendous
number
of
case
which
are
processed.
the
availability
of
say
fbi
record
or
in
our
state
an
spi
record
in
addition
to
determine
the
man’s
total
background.
i
know
when
i
tried
cases
in
the
district
courts,
we
merely
have
a
box
which
contains
a
card
with
the
man’s
name
and
his
previous
convictions
from
that
court,
nothing
else.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
nothing
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
the
point
is
this,
your
honor.
we
are
talking
now
about
the
district
court
judge
or
superior
court
judge?
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
i
think
there
is
a
clear
distinction
to
be
made,
your
honor.
the
district
court
judge
once
that
say
one
week
term
is
over,
could
not
impose
the
greater
sentence.
in
fact,
i
would
say
to
this.
if
the
district
court
judge
had
imposed
a
sentence
and
then
subsequently
determined
he
wished
to
increase
it,
he
could
not
increase
it,
not
that
particular
judge.
but
here
is
a
situation
where
a
man
exercises
absolute
and
unlimited
to
right
to
appeal
his
conviction
to
a
superior
court
and
in
the
eyes
of
our
case
law
and
our
statutes,
this
wipes
the
slate
clean,
as
if
it
never
happened
and
he
is
given
a
new
opportunity.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
from
the
district
court?
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
i
would
not
call
an
appeal
as
such.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
you
might
--
i
have
marked
on
the
record
appeal
noted,
but
an
application
for
brand
new
trial.
he
can
still
appeal.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
i
would
not
call
it
an
appeal,
your
honor.
he
has
wiped
the
slate
clean,
he
is
given
the
opportunity
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
there
are
two
instances
here,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
if
you
permit
me
to
draw
a
distinction?
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
one,
the
cases
within
the
jurisdiction
of
a
district
court
are
two-fold.
those
which
are
petty
misdemeanors,
is
only
person’s
violations,
traffic
violations.
two,
those
which
can
be
noted
as
serious
misdemeanors.
as
to
those
which
are
serious
misdemeanors,
constitutional
law,
federal
constitutional
law
requires
that
he
be
given
an
opportunity
to
a
jury
trial.
as
to
those
which
are
petty
misdemeanors,
he
would
have
no
federal
constitutional
right
to
a
jury
trial.
in
any
event
our
state
constitution
as
a
part
of
the
organic
law
of
the
state
of
north
carolina,
massachusetts
and
several
others
states
provides
that
there
shall
be
a
right
to
trial
de
novo.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
an
appeal,
if
we
permit
in
that
context
your
honor,
there
is
no
constitution
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
the
procedure
would
be
this
of
course,
your
honor.
if
the
defendant
is
tried
in
the
district
court,
he
can
apply
for
trial
de
novo
in
the
superior
court.
if
he
is
unsatisfied
with
the
conviction
and,
well,
i
should
say
sentence,
but
unsatisfied
with
conviction
in
the
superior
court,
he
may
apply,
he
may
appeal
as
a
matter
of
right
to
the
north
carolina
court
of
appeals.
from
the
north
carolina
court
of
appeals
he
could
then
if
it
is
a
constitutional
issue
presented
which
are
not
previously
been
determined,
apply
either
by
certiorari
or
direct
appeal
to
supreme
court,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
your
honor
he
may
not.
he
has
to
go
to
the
superior
court.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
your
honor,
the
only
method
of
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
in
that
i
will
forward
an
appeal,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
your
honor,
(voice
overlap)
we
have
to
make
a
distinction
here
i
believe
between
the
case
of
north
carolina
versus
pearce
which
is
the
basis
of
this
and
the
facts
presented
here.
in
the
pearce
case
a
defendant
was
convicted
in
a
superior
court
of
right.
ultimately
because
of
the
inadmissibility
of
his
confession,
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
reversed
and
received
a
greater
sentence
upon
retrial
in
the
same
court
which
convicted
him
the
first
time.
here,
it
is
an
entirely
different
proposition.i
t
is
not
the
same
court.
it
is
not
a
judge
of
the
same
level
of
jurisdiction.
the
trial
now
is
before
a
judge
of
superior
court.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
which
court
your
honor?
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
the
highest
court
is
the
supreme
court.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
they
have
no
sentencing
power
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
under
the
doctrine
of
north
carolina
versus
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
of
course
pearce,
your
honor,
does
not
state
that
enhanced
sentences
are
invalid
unless
of
course
this
court
has
stated
that
if
the
judge
places
on
the
record
supervening
information
or
conduct
as
the
defendant
then
enhanced
sentences
are
constitutionally
permissible.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
assuming
he
did
not
that
upon
a
reversal,
upon
a
point
of
law
the
superior
court
could
not
impose
a
greater
sentence
than
that
superior
court
had
imposed
him
in
this
instance.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
your
honor,
that
is
not
an
appellate
court.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
this,
we
have
a
problem
with
semantics
here,
your
honor.
the
case
is
in
the
contemplation
of
the
law
as
if
it
had
originated
there
in
the
first
instance.
i
believe
we
are
using
the
word
“appeal”
when
i
think
a
proper
phrase
out
would
have
been
application
for
trial
de
novo,
it
is
a
question
of
right.
there
is
no
need
to
point
out
error
to
prove
error.
a
man
could
take
this
application
even
from
a
guilty
plea
because
he
was
merely
dissatisfied
with
the
sentence.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
the
jurisdiction?
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
your
honor,
i
certainly
would
not
argue
an
issue
of
mootness
in
this
case
because
we
have
this
fourth
circuit
opinion
which
is
hanging
as
damocles
sword
over
the
head
of
the
state
of
north
carolina
and
the
other
states
which
have
joined
with
us
amicus.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i
have
no
idea.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
but
we
have
a
fourth
circuit
opinion
which
--
an
order
which
tells
us
that
we
must
expunge
the
record
and
if
mr.
rice
comes
back
as
his
record
appears
he
probably
will,
then
according
to
that
expunction
order
this
conviction
would
never
have
existed
and
it
would
be
no
possibility
for
number
one
to
impose
a
sentence
which
is
required
upon
second
conviction
driving
under
the
influence
or
license
revocation
for
that
period
of
time.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
your
honor
because
it
is
obvious
that
the
fourth
circuit
will
merely
reinstate
and
yet
another
case's
doctrine
and
we
would
be
faced
with
exactly
what
we
are
facing
now.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i
do
not
believe
it
is
advisory,
your
honor,
because
we
have
the
order
of
the
fourth
circuit
requiring
expunction
staring
us
in
the
face
and
this
is
a
valid
order
and
i
would
say
to
this
court
that
this
order
gives
validity
to
the
status
of
our
case
before
this
court.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
it
is
not
moot
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
there
is
an
order
that
we
have
which
has
been
stayed,
but
that
order
is
effective.
the
american
bar
association
has
had
the
opportunity
to
review
this
very
contingent
and
the
american
bar
association
standards
relating
to
jury
trial
i
point
this
court’s
attention
to
1.1
(b)
and
the
american
bar
standards
to
prove
draft
issued
in
1968
states,
defendants
in
all
criminal
cases
shall
have
the
right
to
be
tried
by
a
jury
of
twelve
whose
verdict
must
be
unanimous.
except
that
we
are
not
barred
by
applicable
constitution
provisions,
the
right
to
jury
trial
may
be
limited
in
one
or
more
of
the
following
ways;
of
requiring
trial
of
that
jury
for
lesser
offenses
provided
there
is
a
right
to
appeal
without
unreasonable
restrictions
to
a
court
in
which
a
trial
de
novo
by
jury
may
be
had
and
that
is
exactly
the
situation
which
our
district
court
system
provides.
in
the
commentary,
in
the
aba’s
approved
draft,
it
also
discusses
the
various
states
in
which
this
is
a
part
of
the
state
constitution
and
that
includes
delaware,
new
hampshire,
north
carolina,
virginia,
and
massachusetts.
in
fact,
i
would
like
to
point
this
court’s
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
supreme
judicial
council
of
the
state
of
massachusetts
had
just
had
the
opportunity
to
review
this
very
issue
because
the
massachusetts
as
in
north
carolina,
this
is
an
organic
part
of
our
state
constitution
and
the
case
of
mann
versus
commonwealth
which
was
first
decided
june
15
of
this
year
and
is
reported
in
271
north
east
second
at
331,
a
very
recent
case
came
out
in
the
(inaudible)
just
the
end
of
last
month.
the
chief
justice
of
massachusetts
for
a
unanimous
court
found
as
has
the
state
supreme
courts
of
north
carolina,
virginia,
nebraska,
michigan,
maine
and
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
the
moe
v.
robins
that
the
imposition
of
a
greater
sentence
upon
trial
de
novo
is
not
viable
to
the
due
process
and
does
not
contradict
this
court’s
opinion
in
north
carolina
versus
pearce.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
your
honor,
this
of
course
is
almost
an
impossible
figure
to
produce.
i
can
point
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i
can
point
this
out,
your
honor,
that
last
year,
finally
in
december
of
last
year,
a
district
court
system
was
fully
implemented
to
the
hundred
counties
in
north
carolina
and
statistics
which
we
have
reflect
those
83
counties
which
under
the
administrative
office
of
the
courts,
last
year,
in
those
83
of
the
hundred
counties
for
which
figures
are
available,
there
were
16,751
of
such
hearings
which
constituted
57.4%
of
all
cases
tried
in
our
superior
court.
i
would
submit
in
disregard
that
when
57.4%
of
all
trials
in
superior
court
with
all
the
formalities
of
the
superior
court
are
de
novo
trials.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
that
is
right,
your
honor.
of
all
criminal
cases
tried
in
our
superior
court
57%
are
de
novo
hearing.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
your
honor,
i
would
say
this
that
obviously
the
state
has
an
interest
in
trying
to
save
a
system
of
criminal
justice.
that
without
the
district
courts,
the
superior
courts
will
not
be
able
to
function.
if
defendants
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
this
is
of
course
part
of
it,
your
honor.
we
are,
if
i
can
just
be
bluntly
or
frank
and
silly
that
if
it
is
a
one
way
street,
if
the
state
and
the
defendant
are
not
on
the
parity,
if
ever
defendant
knows
that
the
sentence
imposed
below
is
the
absolute
maximum,
he
has
everything
to
gain
and
possibly
nothing
to
lose
that
i
doubt
if
the
superior
courts
can
long
survive.
we
are
presently
trying
to
keep
up
with
the
constitutional
requirement
of
speedy
trial.
the
leverage
factor
here
is
frightening.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i
am
saying
this,
your
honor.
if
a
defendant
wishes
to
apply
for
trial
de
novo
from
a
district
court
judge
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
a
trial
in
the
superior
court,
your
honor,
brings
forth
a
great
deal
additional
evidence.
it
is
tried
before
a
jury.
it
is
tried
by
the
solicitor.
it
is
tried
before
a
superior
court
judge,
more
evidence
is
brought
out.
the
cross-examination
is
more
intense,
more
records
are
made
available
to
the
court.
i
say
that
the
authority,
the
discretion
of
the
judge
at
superior
court
is
at
question
that
if
judges
of
the
superior
court
where
there
because
we
expect
their
expertise
and
who
developed
an
expertise
in
that
particular
case
before
them
cannot
exercise
their
judgment
and
their
discretion,
then
how
long
can
the
court
system
continue?
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
your
honor,
there
are
many
different
states.
now,
some
states,
now,
in
the
petitioner’s
brief
he
cites,
excuse
me,
in
professor's
brief,
he
cites
the
dabonus
(ph)
case
from
new
jersey
which
was
determined
by
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
as
a
policy
issue.
as
a
matter
of
policy
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
took
the
opportunity
to
criticize
the
structuring
of
their
municipal
courts
which
were
locally
appointed
part-time
judges.
in
north
carolina,
we
have
a
district
court
system
with
full-time
judges.
it
is
a
unified
system
which
has
taken
15
years
to
implement.
the
professor
cites
comments
from
a
report
in
the
mid
50s
and
that
report
we
took
to
heart
and
the
state
of
north
carolina
revamped
its
entire
judicial
system.
we
have
a
completely
unified
system
now
with
full-time
judges
who
are
paid
a
very
respectable
salary.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
your
honor,
no.
there
are
very
few
cases
in
which
that
occurs
and
that
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
there
are
several
reasons.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
let
me
say
this.
number
one,
the
professor
states
in
his
brief
there
is
no
provision
for
representation
in
the
district
court
that
is
wrong.
he
cites
as
precedent
for
one
point,
the
case
of
state
versus
mars
which
he
cites
for
the
proposition
that
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
has
refused
to
adapt
the
holding
in
the
patent
case
which
was
the
basis
for
pearce.
but
in
that
very
case
state
versus
mars,
associate
justice
suzie
sharp
(ph)
held
that
a
man
has
a
constitutional
right
to
representation
by
counsel
if
he
is
indigent
in
the
district
court
in
a
serious
misdemeanor.
we
have
counsel
in
those
courts
and
if
that
man
wishes
to
appeal,
it
goes
on
to
the
superior
court,
that
same
counsel
paid
for
by
the
state.
if
he
wishes
to
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals,
we
pay
for
counsel.
this
year
we
funded
$1.8
million
with
the
appointment
of
counsel.
we
have
public
defenders
in
two
of
our
counties.
we
have
counsel
in
on
those
courts.
the
public
defenders
office
in
their
report
to
the
court
which,
excuse
me
your
honor,
i
see
that
i
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
in
the
public
defenders
office
and
under
our
statutory
scheme
which
provides
for
the
appointment
of
counsel
any
felony
case
and
any
misdemeanor
case
for
which
the
authorized
punishment
exceeds
six
months
in
prison
or
$500.00
we
have
counsel.
and
to
illustrate
this
very
point,
the
public
defender's
office
and
the
two
test
counties
where
we
presently
have
public
defenders,
in
one
county
they
were
appointed
to
represent
949
persons
during
the
year,
that
was
877
felonies
and
they
also
were
involved
in
396
serious
misdemeanors
in
the
state.
the
course
of
its
representation,
the
office
made
612
appearances
in
the
district
court,
404
in
the
superior
court.
the
other
office,
the
office
made
601
appearances
in
district
court,
239
in
the
superior
court.
we
do
have
counsel
in
the
district
court
system.
(voice
overlap)
if
there
any
questions
left
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
have
here
the
annual
report
of
the
administrative
office
of
the
courts
for
the
year
1970
and
in
answer
to
the
question
concerning
representation
of
indigents.
the
report
reads,
“concern
has
been
expressed
as
to
incident
of
indigency
among
the
defendants
and
criminal
cases
processed
by
our
courts.
as
to
the
trial
court’s
this
data
not
available.
in
the
appellate
division
it
is
available
and
interesting.
of
the
criminal
appeals
docketed
in
the
court
of
appeals
during
calendar
year
1968,
70.3%
involved
indigents.
the
figures
for
1969
and
1970
were
72.2%
and
76.1%
respectively.
in
the
supreme
court
73.1%
of
the
criminal
appeals
docketed
in
1968
were
brought
by
indigents.
during
the
two
succeeding
years
the
percentages
were
71.8%
and
81.1%
respectively.
this
data
which
seem
to
support
the
inference
already
drawn
by
some
on
the
basis
of
the
records
on
appeal
that
many
indigents
have
come
to
the
appellate
court
for
no
other
apparent
reason
and
that
the
court
is
there.”
there
are
some
other
comments
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
your
honor
and
i
am
not
reading
further
because
there
are
some
other
comments.
i
would
just
to
point
out
that
in
this
year,
we
have
budgeted
$1,822,797.00
for
indigent
counsel
and
i
am
advised
in
discussion
yesterday
with
the
administrator
director
of
the
courts,
the
courts
will
run
out
of
money.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
this
court
upon
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
which
held
in
rice
versus
north
carolina
that
upon
the
strength
of
pearce,
the
imposition
of
a
greater
sentence
is
impermissible
in
a
situation
in
which
a
defendant
receives
a
trial
de
novo
in
the
superior
court
from
a
lower
criminal
court.
and
that
was
the
legal
conclusion
without
the
courts
giving
any
legal
reasoning.
the
course
then
went
on
to
stage
in
reference
to
all
the
cases
to
the
contrary,
but
they
simply
disagreed
and
ordered
the
state
of
north
carolina
to
expunge
any
record
of
mr.
rice’s
conviction
in
the
buncombe
county
superior
court.
wayne
claude
rice
was
originally
arrested
on
july
2,
1968
for
driving
under
the
influence
of
alcohol.
on
july
19,
1968,
he
was
tried
in
the
buncombe
county
court
which
was
then
in
existence
and
received
a
sentence
of
a
nine-month
sentence
suspended
upon
payment
of
a
fine
of
$100.00
and
costs.
as
was
his
absolute
right,
he
applied
for
a
trial
de
novo
in
the
buncombe
county
superior
court.
on
august
2,
his
right
to
trial
de
novo
was
assured
and
on
that
day
he
first
pled
guilty
to
twelve
offenses
of
uttering
worthless
checks
and
then
was
tried
upon
his
plea
of
not
guilty
on
the
charge
of
driving
under
the
influence.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
only
in
this
regard,
your
honor.
there
were
these
twelve
worthless
check
charges.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
he
pled
guilty
to
those,
was
then
tried
upon
the
plea
of
not
guilty
as
driving
under
the
influence.
the
sentence
or
the
sentences
that
were
then
imposed,
he
received
a
two-year
active
sentence
for
driving
under
the
influence,
the
maximum
then
permitted
under
the
law,
but
the
same
time
when
the
judge
sentenced
him
as
to
the
worthless
check
charges,
he
was
sentenced
to
the
consecutive
one-month
sentences
to
run
concurrently
with
the
sentence
imposed
for
driving
under
the
influence.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
your
honor.
it
was
concurrent
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
not
except
for
--
to
the
first
year
of
the
sentences
were
concurrent
whereas
the
court
could
have
imposed
the
sentence
consecutively,
it
was
imposed
concurrently
and
he
received
no
greater
sentence
as
result
of
having
pled
guilty
to
the
twelve
worthless
check
charges.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes
your
honor,
that
is
true.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
his
original
sentence
was
nine
months
suspended
upon
payment
of
$100.00
fine
and
costs.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
oh
yes,
your
honor,
quite
clear!
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
not
at
all.
in
fact
concurrent
sentence,
your
honor,
i
believe
is
merely
something
applies
to
the
federal
judiciary
and
it
is
not
applicable
to
the
states.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
with
all
something
separate
and
apart,
your
honor.
he
received
twelve,
there
were
twelve
warrants
in
the
county
court
at
this
stage
from
january
of
that
year.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
your
honor,
he
applied
for
trial
de
novo
in
these
cases
and
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
before
whom
he
appeared
in
a
driving
under
the
influence,
your
honor?
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i
have
no
idea.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
only
this
respect,
your
honor,
on
the
same
day
when
his
trial
de
novo
for
the
worthless
checks
came
up
for
hearing,
he
also
was
on
for
hearing
for
his
drunk
driving
charge.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
oh
yes,
your
honor,
these
are
all
de
novo.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
it
defends,
your
honor,
upon
the
amount.
at
the
present
time
if
it
does
not
exceed
$50.00,
the
maximum
is
thirty
days.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
apparently
so,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
every
petty
offense,
your
honor.
the
right
to
trial
de
novo
is
an
absolute
right
granted
in
the
north
carolina
constitution.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
your
honor,
for
every
offense
which
is
originally
tried
in
what
are
now
say
the
district
court.
this
could
be
and
ordinance
violation
or
could
be
an
overtime
parking
ticket,
traffic
violation
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
in
the
district
court,
your
honor
or
perhaps
let
me
express
the
other
way.
the
original
jurisdiction
of
the
superior
court
is
only
applicable
to
felonies.
all
other
offenses,
the
district
court
has
original
jurisdiction,
that
is
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
there
is
no
right
to
trial
by
jury
in
the
district
court
your
honor,
criminal
matters.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
that
is
exactly
right,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
oh
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
oh
yes,
your
honor.
they
were
tried
in
what
was
in
the
county
court
and
--
what
your
honor?
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
your
honor
and
then
he
appealed
and
pled
guilty.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i
am
really
not
sure
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
your
honor.
i
believe
it
was
the
same
but
i
am
really
not
sure.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
your
honor.
this
gentleman
has
a
record
dating
back
to
1948.
i
have
here
the
so-called
fbi
wrap
sheet.
it
starts
in
1948
and
he
has
spent
more
time
in
custody.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
your
honor.
in
1962
he
was
convicted
of
escape,
temporary
larceny
of
automobile,
larceny
of
an
automobile
and
drunk
driving.
this
was
not
his
first.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
your
honor,
i
would
say
this.
unfortunately,
the
district
courts
are
the
courts
of
original
jurisdiction.
this
is
where
the
great
mass
of
cases
are
tried.
the
felony
cases
are
only
minuscule
part
of
the
total
case
load
in
the
criminal
judicial
system
and
unfortunately
in
the
district
courts,
the
district
court
judge
does
not
have
made
available
to
him,
all
the
resources
which
are
available
in
the
superior
court.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
this
is
a
misstatement,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
oh!
we
are
talking
now
your
honor
of
nine
months
of
driving
with
the
influence,
30
days
was
the
bad
check
charge.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
your
honor.
there
is
a
problem
involved
here
due
to
the
fact
that
the
sentence
for
driving
under
the
influence
was
amended
subsequent
to
mr.
rice’s
trial.
whether
or
not
that
amendment
in
the
statute
and
the
downgrading
of
the
maximum
should
be
part
of
the
issue
here,
i
am
merely
not
sure.
the
maximum
now
i
believe
is
six
months
for
first
offense
driving
under
the
influence.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
he
received
nine
months
at
the
time
when
two
years
was
a
permissible
maximum,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
your
honor,
at
that
time
the
statute
permitted
up
to
two
years
for
first
offense
driving
under
the
influence.
he
did
receive
the
first,
the
maximum,
but
this
is
bogging
the
issue
because
of
subsequent
legislative
down
grading
of
the
maximum
sentence.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
but
since
i
have
this
here,
i
just
want
to
point
out
that
since
1948,
mr.
rice
spent
more
time
in
custody
than
he
has
out
of
custody.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
there
is
an
absolute
right
to
trial
de
novo
in
the
state
of
north
carolina,
your
honor.
it
does
not
matter
whether
or
not
the
defendant
pled
guilty
or
not
guilty.
if
he
pleads
guilty
and
is
not
satisfied
with
the
sentence
that
is
imposed,
he
can
apply
for
trial
de
novo
that
wipes
the
entire
proceeding
clean.
it
is
completely
off
the
record
and
he
will
then
have
an
opportunity
for
a
jury
trial
in
a
superior
court
as
if
nothing
had
ever
happened
before.
i
just
have
been
advised
that
according
to
mr.
rice’s
prison
jacket
he
received
the
same
sentence
in
the
superior
court
as
he
had
received
in
the
county
court
upon
the
worthless
check
charges.
now,
subsequent
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
your
honor,
i
am
confident
that
upon
his
trial
in
superior
court
which
was
then
the
responsibility
of
the
solicitor
to
a
full
jury
trial
that
this
information
was
obtained.
now,
i
am
familiar
with
procedures
in
the
district
court,
previously
the
county
courts.
the
only
record
available
to
the
judge
at
the
time
is
they
listed
a
man's
convictions
in
that
particular
court.
the
court
does
not
have
available
to
it
due
to
the
tremendous
number
of
case
which
are
processed.
the
availability
of
say
fbi
record
or
in
our
state
an
spi
record
in
addition
to
determine
the
man’s
total
background.
i
know
when
i
tried
cases
in
the
district
courts,
we
merely
have
a
box
which
contains
a
card
with
the
man’s
name
and
his
previous
convictions
from
that
court,
nothing
else.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
nothing
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
the
point
is
this,
your
honor.
we
are
talking
now
about
the
district
court
judge
or
superior
court
judge?
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
i
think
there
is
a
clear
distinction
to
be
made,
your
honor.
the
district
court
judge
once
that
say
one
week
term
is
over,
could
not
impose
the
greater
sentence.
in
fact,
i
would
say
to
this.
if
the
district
court
judge
had
imposed
a
sentence
and
then
subsequently
determined
he
wished
to
increase
it,
he
could
not
increase
it,
not
that
particular
judge.
but
here
is
a
situation
where
a
man
exercises
absolute
and
unlimited
to
right
to
appeal
his
conviction
to
a
superior
court
and
in
the
eyes
of
our
case
law
and
our
statutes,
this
wipes
the
slate
clean,
as
if
it
never
happened
and
he
is
given
a
new
opportunity.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
from
the
district
court?
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
i
would
not
call
an
appeal
as
such.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
you
might
--
i
have
marked
on
the
record
appeal
noted,
but
an
application
for
brand
new
trial.
he
can
still
appeal.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
i
would
not
call
it
an
appeal,
your
honor.
he
has
wiped
the
slate
clean,
he
is
given
the
opportunity
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
there
are
two
instances
here,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
if
you
permit
me
to
draw
a
distinction?
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
one,
the
cases
within
the
jurisdiction
of
a
district
court
are
two-fold.
those
which
are
petty
misdemeanors,
is
only
person’s
violations,
traffic
violations.
two,
those
which
can
be
noted
as
serious
misdemeanors.
as
to
those
which
are
serious
misdemeanors,
constitutional
law,
federal
constitutional
law
requires
that
he
be
given
an
opportunity
to
a
jury
trial.
as
to
those
which
are
petty
misdemeanors,
he
would
have
no
federal
constitutional
right
to
a
jury
trial.
in
any
event
our
state
constitution
as
a
part
of
the
organic
law
of
the
state
of
north
carolina,
massachusetts
and
several
others
states
provides
that
there
shall
be
a
right
to
trial
de
novo.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
an
appeal,
if
we
permit
in
that
context
your
honor,
there
is
no
constitution
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
the
procedure
would
be
this
of
course,
your
honor.
if
the
defendant
is
tried
in
the
district
court,
he
can
apply
for
trial
de
novo
in
the
superior
court.
if
he
is
unsatisfied
with
the
conviction
and,
well,
i
should
say
sentence,
but
unsatisfied
with
conviction
in
the
superior
court,
he
may
apply,
he
may
appeal
as
a
matter
of
right
to
the
north
carolina
court
of
appeals.
from
the
north
carolina
court
of
appeals
he
could
then
if
it
is
a
constitutional
issue
presented
which
are
not
previously
been
determined,
apply
either
by
certiorari
or
direct
appeal
to
supreme
court,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
your
honor
he
may
not.
he
has
to
go
to
the
superior
court.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
your
honor,
the
only
method
of
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
in
that
i
will
forward
an
appeal,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
your
honor,
(voice
overlap)
we
have
to
make
a
distinction
here
i
believe
between
the
case
of
north
carolina
versus
pearce
which
is
the
basis
of
this
and
the
facts
presented
here.
in
the
pearce
case
a
defendant
was
convicted
in
a
superior
court
of
right.
ultimately
because
of
the
inadmissibility
of
his
confession,
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
reversed
and
received
a
greater
sentence
upon
retrial
in
the
same
court
which
convicted
him
the
first
time.
here,
it
is
an
entirely
different
proposition.i
t
is
not
the
same
court.
it
is
not
a
judge
of
the
same
level
of
jurisdiction.
the
trial
now
is
before
a
judge
of
superior
court.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
which
court
your
honor?
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
the
highest
court
is
the
supreme
court.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
they
have
no
sentencing
power
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
under
the
doctrine
of
north
carolina
versus
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
of
course
pearce,
your
honor,
does
not
state
that
enhanced
sentences
are
invalid
unless
of
course
this
court
has
stated
that
if
the
judge
places
on
the
record
supervening
information
or
conduct
as
the
defendant
then
enhanced
sentences
are
constitutionally
permissible.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
assuming
he
did
not
that
upon
a
reversal,
upon
a
point
of
law
the
superior
court
could
not
impose
a
greater
sentence
than
that
superior
court
had
imposed
him
in
this
instance.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
your
honor,
that
is
not
an
appellate
court.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
this,
we
have
a
problem
with
semantics
here,
your
honor.
the
case
is
in
the
contemplation
of
the
law
as
if
it
had
originated
there
in
the
first
instance.
i
believe
we
are
using
the
word
“appeal”
when
i
think
a
proper
phrase
out
would
have
been
application
for
trial
de
novo,
it
is
a
question
of
right.
there
is
no
need
to
point
out
error
to
prove
error.
a
man
could
take
this
application
even
from
a
guilty
plea
because
he
was
merely
dissatisfied
with
the
sentence.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
the
jurisdiction?
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
your
honor,
i
certainly
would
not
argue
an
issue
of
mootness
in
this
case
because
we
have
this
fourth
circuit
opinion
which
is
hanging
as
damocles
sword
over
the
head
of
the
state
of
north
carolina
and
the
other
states
which
have
joined
with
us
amicus.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i
have
no
idea.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
but
we
have
a
fourth
circuit
opinion
which
--
an
order
which
tells
us
that
we
must
expunge
the
record
and
if
mr.
rice
comes
back
as
his
record
appears
he
probably
will,
then
according
to
that
expunction
order
this
conviction
would
never
have
existed
and
it
would
be
no
possibility
for
number
one
to
impose
a
sentence
which
is
required
upon
second
conviction
driving
under
the
influence
or
license
revocation
for
that
period
of
time.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
your
honor
because
it
is
obvious
that
the
fourth
circuit
will
merely
reinstate
and
yet
another
case's
doctrine
and
we
would
be
faced
with
exactly
what
we
are
facing
now.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i
do
not
believe
it
is
advisory,
your
honor,
because
we
have
the
order
of
the
fourth
circuit
requiring
expunction
staring
us
in
the
face
and
this
is
a
valid
order
and
i
would
say
to
this
court
that
this
order
gives
validity
to
the
status
of
our
case
before
this
court.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
it
is
not
moot
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
there
is
an
order
that
we
have
which
has
been
stayed,
but
that
order
is
effective.
the
american
bar
association
has
had
the
opportunity
to
review
this
very
contingent
and
the
american
bar
association
standards
relating
to
jury
trial
i
point
this
court’s
attention
to
1.1
(b)
and
the
american
bar
standards
to
prove
draft
issued
in
1968
states,
defendants
in
all
criminal
cases
shall
have
the
right
to
be
tried
by
a
jury
of
twelve
whose
verdict
must
be
unanimous.
except
that
we
are
not
barred
by
applicable
constitution
provisions,
the
right
to
jury
trial
may
be
limited
in
one
or
more
of
the
following
ways;
of
requiring
trial
of
that
jury
for
lesser
offenses
provided
there
is
a
right
to
appeal
without
unreasonable
restrictions
to
a
court
in
which
a
trial
de
novo
by
jury
may
be
had
and
that
is
exactly
the
situation
which
our
district
court
system
provides.
in
the
commentary,
in
the
aba’s
approved
draft,
it
also
discusses
the
various
states
in
which
this
is
a
part
of
the
state
constitution
and
that
includes
delaware,
new
hampshire,
north
carolina,
virginia,
and
massachusetts.
in
fact,
i
would
like
to
point
this
court’s
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
supreme
judicial
council
of
the
state
of
massachusetts
had
just
had
the
opportunity
to
review
this
very
issue
because
the
massachusetts
as
in
north
carolina,
this
is
an
organic
part
of
our
state
constitution
and
the
case
of
mann
versus
commonwealth
which
was
first
decided
june
15
of
this
year
and
is
reported
in
271
north
east
second
at
331,
a
very
recent
case
came
out
in
the
(inaudible)
just
the
end
of
last
month.
the
chief
justice
of
massachusetts
for
a
unanimous
court
found
as
has
the
state
supreme
courts
of
north
carolina,
virginia,
nebraska,
michigan,
maine
and
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
the
moe
v.
robins
that
the
imposition
of
a
greater
sentence
upon
trial
de
novo
is
not
viable
to
the
due
process
and
does
not
contradict
this
court’s
opinion
in
north
carolina
versus
pearce.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
your
honor,
this
of
course
is
almost
an
impossible
figure
to
produce.
i
can
point
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i
can
point
this
out,
your
honor,
that
last
year,
finally
in
december
of
last
year,
a
district
court
system
was
fully
implemented
to
the
hundred
counties
in
north
carolina
and
statistics
which
we
have
reflect
those
83
counties
which
under
the
administrative
office
of
the
courts,
last
year,
in
those
83
of
the
hundred
counties
for
which
figures
are
available,
there
were
16,751
of
such
hearings
which
constituted
57.4%
of
all
cases
tried
in
our
superior
court.
i
would
submit
in
disregard
that
when
57.4%
of
all
trials
in
superior
court
with
all
the
formalities
of
the
superior
court
are
de
novo
trials.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
that
is
right,
your
honor.
of
all
criminal
cases
tried
in
our
superior
court
57%
are
de
novo
hearing.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
your
honor,
i
would
say
this
that
obviously
the
state
has
an
interest
in
trying
to
save
a
system
of
criminal
justice.
that
without
the
district
courts,
the
superior
courts
will
not
be
able
to
function.
if
defendants
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
this
is
of
course
part
of
it,
your
honor.
we
are,
if
i
can
just
be
bluntly
or
frank
and
silly
that
if
it
is
a
one
way
street,
if
the
state
and
the
defendant
are
not
on
the
parity,
if
ever
defendant
knows
that
the
sentence
imposed
below
is
the
absolute
maximum,
he
has
everything
to
gain
and
possibly
nothing
to
lose
that
i
doubt
if
the
superior
courts
can
long
survive.
we
are
presently
trying
to
keep
up
with
the
constitutional
requirement
of
speedy
trial.
the
leverage
factor
here
is
frightening.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i
am
saying
this,
your
honor.
if
a
defendant
wishes
to
apply
for
trial
de
novo
from
a
district
court
judge
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
a
trial
in
the
superior
court,
your
honor,
brings
forth
a
great
deal
additional
evidence.
it
is
tried
before
a
jury.
it
is
tried
by
the
solicitor.
it
is
tried
before
a
superior
court
judge,
more
evidence
is
brought
out.
the
cross-examination
is
more
intense,
more
records
are
made
available
to
the
court.
i
say
that
the
authority,
the
discretion
of
the
judge
at
superior
court
is
at
question
that
if
judges
of
the
superior
court
where
there
because
we
expect
their
expertise
and
who
developed
an
expertise
in
that
particular
case
before
them
cannot
exercise
their
judgment
and
their
discretion,
then
how
long
can
the
court
system
continue?
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
your
honor,
there
are
many
different
states.
now,
some
states,
now,
in
the
petitioner’s
brief
he
cites,
excuse
me,
in
professor's
brief,
he
cites
the
dabonus
(ph)
case
from
new
jersey
which
was
determined
by
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
as
a
policy
issue.
as
a
matter
of
policy
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
took
the
opportunity
to
criticize
the
structuring
of
their
municipal
courts
which
were
locally
appointed
part-time
judges.
in
north
carolina,
we
have
a
district
court
system
with
full-time
judges.
it
is
a
unified
system
which
has
taken
15
years
to
implement.
the
professor
cites
comments
from
a
report
in
the
mid
50s
and
that
report
we
took
to
heart
and
the
state
of
north
carolina
revamped
its
entire
judicial
system.
we
have
a
completely
unified
system
now
with
full-time
judges
who
are
paid
a
very
respectable
salary.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
your
honor,
no.
there
are
very
few
cases
in
which
that
occurs
and
that
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
there
are
several
reasons.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
let
me
say
this.
number
one,
the
professor
states
in
his
brief
there
is
no
provision
for
representation
in
the
district
court
that
is
wrong.
he
cites
as
precedent
for
one
point,
the
case
of
state
versus
mars
which
he
cites
for
the
proposition
that
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
has
refused
to
adapt
the
holding
in
the
patent
case
which
was
the
basis
for
pearce.
but
in
that
very
case
state
versus
mars,
associate
justice
suzie
sharp
(ph)
held
that
a
man
has
a
constitutional
right
to
representation
by
counsel
if
he
is
indigent
in
the
district
court
in
a
serious
misdemeanor.
we
have
counsel
in
those
courts
and
if
that
man
wishes
to
appeal,
it
goes
on
to
the
superior
court,
that
same
counsel
paid
for
by
the
state.
if
he
wishes
to
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals,
we
pay
for
counsel.
this
year
we
funded
$1.8
million
with
the
appointment
of
counsel.
we
have
public
defenders
in
two
of
our
counties.
we
have
counsel
in
on
those
courts.
the
public
defenders
office
in
their
report
to
the
court
which,
excuse
me
your
honor,
i
see
that
i
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
in
the
public
defenders
office
and
under
our
statutory
scheme
which
provides
for
the
appointment
of
counsel
any
felony
case
and
any
misdemeanor
case
for
which
the
authorized
punishment
exceeds
six
months
in
prison
or
$500.00
we
have
counsel.
and
to
illustrate
this
very
point,
the
public
defender's
office
and
the
two
test
counties
where
we
presently
have
public
defenders,
in
one
county
they
were
appointed
to
represent
949
persons
during
the
year,
that
was
877
felonies
and
they
also
were
involved
in
396
serious
misdemeanors
in
the
state.
the
course
of
its
representation,
the
office
made
612
appearances
in
the
district
court,
404
in
the
superior
court.
the
other
office,
the
office
made
601
appearances
in
district
court,
239
in
the
superior
court.
we
do
have
counsel
in
the
district
court
system.
(voice

if
there
any
questions
left
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
have
here
the
annual
report
of
the
administrative
office
of
the
courts
for
the
year
1970
and
in
answer
to
the
question
concerning
representation
of
indigents.
the
report
reads,
“concern
has
been
expressed
as
to
incident
of
indigency
among
the
defendants
and
criminal
cases
processed
by
our
courts.
as
to
the
trial
court’s
this
data
not
available.
in
the
appellate
division
it
is
available
and
interesting.
of
the
criminal
appeals
docketed
in
the
court
of
appeals
during
calendar
year
1968,
70.3%
involved
indigents.
the
figures
for
1969
and
1970
were
72.2%
and
76.1%
respectively.
in
the
supreme
court
73.1%
of
the
criminal
appeals
docketed
in
1968
were
brought
by
indigents.
during
the
two
succeeding
years
the
percentages
were
71.8%
and
81.1%
respectively.
this
data
which
seem
to
support
the
inference
already
drawn
by
some
on
the
basis
of
the
records
on
appeal
that
many
indigents
have
come
to
the
appellate
court
for
no
other
apparent
reason
and
that
the
court
is
there.”
there
are
some
other
comments
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
your
honor
and
i
am
not
reading
further
because
there
are
some
other
comments.
i
would
just
to
point
out
that
in
this
year,
we
have
budgeted
$1,822,797.00
for
indigent
counsel
and
i
am
advised
in
discussion
yesterday
with
the
administrator
director
of
the
courts,
the
courts
will
run
out
of
money.
