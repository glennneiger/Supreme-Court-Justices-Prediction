justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
am
confused
about
two
things
in
mr.
rice’s
brief.
it
is
stated
this
was
mr.
rice’s
first
conviction
for
driving
while
intoxicated.
this
is
a
misstatement.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
then
secondly,
i
am
confused
about
the
nine
months
sentence
for
it
imposed
in
the
county
court
when
the
statute
says
for
the
first
conviction,
only
30
days?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
am
not
talking
about
the
sentence.
i
am
talking
about
the
statute.
does
the
statute
not
make
the
first
offense
punishable
no
more
than
30
days?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
any
event
he
got
nine
months?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
only
for
a
third
offense?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
it
is
evident
i
am
referred
by
your
statutes.
i
hope
mr.
van
alstyne
can
straighten
it
out.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
one
last
question.
even
if
he
were
to
plead
guilty
in
the
lower
court,
does
he
have
the
right
to
a
trial
de
novo
(voice
overlap)
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
(inaudible)
one
point
in
179
as
i
read
it,
says
for
the
first

it
is
punishable
by
a
fine
and
not
in
less
than
$100.00.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
