is
an
offense
to
which
on
conviction
the
accused
may
have
a
trial
de

of
right,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

are
these
worthless
check
charges,
would
they
have
been
triable
in
the
district
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see,
and
where
they
in
fact
in
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
pled
guilty
to
the
worthless
check
charge?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
punishment
did
he
get
in
the
district
court
or
the
county
court
on
those
charges?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
any
event,
whatever
it
was
he
appealed
and
got
a
newer
and
larger
and
enhanced
sentence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
safron,
suppose
he
does
not
want
a
trial
de
novo,
but
he
does
want
to
challenge
the
validity
of
his
conviction
in
the
district
court,
may
he
go
directly
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
which
offense?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
indeed
it
would
remain,
even
if
it
were
north
carolina
to
provide
at
some
state
(inaudible)
that
the
sentence
may
not
exceed
in
the
superior
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

you
would
still
have
the
same
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
absence
of
(inaudible)
subsequent
to
the
initial
sentence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
which
would
justify
an
increased
sentence
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
would
come
down
i
gather
in
resubmission.
all
we
decide
in
this
case
are
put
with
each
state
refer
is
that
that
approach
by
as
much
in
this
claim
of
reference
as
it
did
in
what
we
have
recourse
to.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

and
that
would
still
leave
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice

you
have
to
argue
with
other
point
which
--
justice
william

since
there
i
think
it
is
by
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

they
may
not
impose
reference?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

i
should
say.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
would
you
suggest
would
be
upon
conviction
of
some
other
offense
if
he
again
committed
an
offense?
the
fact
that
the
record
show
two
years
of
that
was
it
shows
rather
than
having
it
two
years
expunged
might
result
in
the
subsequent
conviction
a
harsher
sentence
than
otherwise.
justice
william

may
i
ask
(inaudible)
there
was
a
record
in

in
this

justice
william
j.
brennan,

but
at
