justice
thurgood
marshall
these
are
two
indictments,
not
in
one
indictment,
was
it,
the
forged
check?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
was
the
indicted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
these
were
his
check
cases?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
was
he
convicted
by
the
same
judge
below?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
very
confused
as
how
did
worthless
checks
got
involved
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
safron,
suppose
a
man
appeals
--
no,
suppose
if
a
man
after
he
is
convicted,
a
month
later
after
the
sentence,
two
months
later
after
the
sentence
had
been
pronounced,
the
judge
has
come
across
that
wrap
sheet,
does
he
do
anything
about
it
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
what
is
different
in
that
case
and
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
talking
about
the
courts
of
north
carolina.
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
he
have
any
other
way
of
appealing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
that
is
an
appeal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
it
called
in
north
carolina?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
is
still
appeal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
do
you
think
that
state
in
north
carolina
is
bound
to
give
him
a
right
of
appeal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
the
state
of
north
carolina
under
the
constitution
is
bound
to
give
him
an
appeal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
sure.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
under
the
constitution
is
the
man
convicted
in
the
district
court
of
north
carolina,
entitled
to
an
appeal
to
test
the
legality
of
his
conviction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
safron,
if
he
finds
that
there
is
a
possibility
that
is
to
those
who
have
trial
de
novo,
his
sentence
will
be
enhanced?
is
there
any
other
way
he
can
test
that
judgment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
on
constitutional
standard
that
is
an
appeal,
is
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice
overlap)
would
he
agree
if
a
defendant
appealed
to
sentence
him
then
and
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
suppose
after
this
judgment
he
had
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
and
they
had
doubled
his
sentence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
the
highest
court
sought?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
suppose
they
just
send
it
back
to
the
superior
court
for
retrial?
(voice
overlap)
justice
thurgood
marshall
under
the
doctrine
of
pearce
that
would
be
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
assuming
he
did?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it
did
appear
the
superior
court
here
is
sitting
as
the
appellate
court
over
district
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
in
this
case,
what
is
the
case
there?
is
not
the
case
there
on
appeal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
safron,
do
i
gather
what
you
are
saying
is
that
in
order
to
limit
the
number
of
appeals,
de
novo
is
necessary
to
enhance
the
sentence
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
are
you
saying
then?
you
say
you
want
to
leave
this
intact,
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said
because
you
do
not
want
to
increase
the
number
of
cases
in
the
superior
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
van
alstyne,
do
you
mean
that
you
have
never
seen
this
document?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
it
was
not
before
the
court
below?
justice
thurgood
marshall
assuming
that
mr.
rice
gets
to
(inaudible)
and
does
not
commit
any
more
crimes,
he
does
not
have
a
word
on?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
now
we
have
sort
of
conflict
between
you
and
the
fourth
circuit,
i
am
at
loss
as
to
how
you
solve
it.
you
say
the
convictions
are
right.
the
fourth
circuit
says
it
is
not.
you
say
it
is
the
sentence
that
is
wrong
and
the
fourth
circuit
does
not,
so
where
that
comes
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
have
to
decide
between
you
and
the
fourth
circuit
manner?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
there
one
word
in
pearce
that
says
you
were
