i
noticed
mr.

in
the
brief
the
reference
to
the
worthless
check
charge,
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
issues
before
us
(voice

justice

yes.
justice
potter
stewart
but
was
only
partially
concurrent.
in
other
words,
one
with
a
total
of
one
year
and
on
the
driving
intoxicated
was
a
two-year
sentence?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
we
do
not
have
really
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
we
have
at
least
one
additional
year
based
on
the
driving
while
intoxicated?
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
the
original
so-called
sub-constitutional
court,
“your
adversary”
his
sentence
was
what?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
we
do
have
before
us
--
this
issue
is
clearly
presented?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
not
blunted
at
all
really
by
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine?
justice
potter
stewart
you
agree,
in
other
words,
that
the
case
is
not
moot?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
unlike,
the
only
point
i
suppose
best
been
outlined
is
that
unlike
conventional
appeal,
one
need
not
even
allege
any
error?
justice
potter
stewart
one
has
an
absolute
right
to
this
new
trial
without
even
claiming
any
error
in
the
original
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
in
that
connection
mr.
van
alstyne,
does
this
mean
that
if
he
feels
there
is
error
below
in
the
district
court
that
he
may
not
even
move
for
a
new
trial
in
that
court,
his
only
avenue
of
relief
is
to
take
this
so-called
appeal?
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
are
right
in
your
basic
contention,
this
is
wholly
irrelevant?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean,
even
if
the
reason
had
before
the
enhanced
sentence
had
been
information
in
the
wrap
sheet,
it
was
not
available
in
the
lower
court?
justice
potter
stewart
you
are
right
that
you
still
prevail,
this
is
irrelevant?
justice
potter
stewart
does
that
point
of
the
chief
justice
taken
even
further
down
the
road,
if
you
agree
that
as
i
think
you
are
quite
right
in
conceding
that
there
is
nothing
invalid
about
this
conviction
and
since
he
has
now
served
his
sentence,
the
only
invalidity
went
to
the
length
of
the
sentence
which
he
now
served,
why
is
this
case
not
moot?
justice
potter
stewart
from
the
conviction?
justice
potter
stewart
the
fourth
circuit
did
not
apparently,
either
they
did
not
understand
or
they
did
not
accept
your
argument
because
they
say
in
juries
consequences
because
of
the
conviction
might
still
obtain
and
you
are
now
conceding
that
the
convictions
were
improperly
set
aside?
justice
potter
stewart
