mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
might
rather
than
launching
into
an
original
argument,
attempt
to
respond
to
some
of
the
questions
which
were
directed
to
mr.
safron,
simply
by
way
of
helpful
clarification.
so
far
as
the
technicality
of
what
it
is
called
in
16
(a)
new
trial
against
the
correction
of
what
he
may
believe
to
be
an
injustice
committed
in
the
course
of
his
original
trial,
in
the
general
county
court
or
now
in
the
district
court,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
even
in
the
view
of
state
itself
it
is
an
appeal.
indeed
or
by
turning
to
page
17
of
petitioner’s
appendix,
one
of
the
note
that
the
statute
so
defined
it
itself,
it
is
called
an
appeal
to
the
superior
court,
subsequently
appeal
from
district
court,
subsequently
appeal
from
justice
trial
de
novo.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
indeed,
that
is
--
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
unquestionably
correct.
what
needs
to
be
observed
side
by
side
that
observation,
however,
is
it
that
it
is
also
the
exclusive
recourse
one
has
from
any
grievance
which
he
may
honestly
feel
to
pervade
that
original
trial.
in
this
respect
it
seems
to
me
therefore
most
important
that
one
take
the
accurate
measure
of
the
character
of
the
court
in
which
he
is
first
tried.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
that
is
the
case.
that
is
correct,
there
is
no
other
recourse.
the
court
in
which
he
is
first
tried
is
not
a
court
that
merely
tries
petty
offenses.
i
quite
take
exception
to
that
description.
indeed
the
original
and
exclusive
jurisdiction,
original
and
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
a
district
court
runs
to
misdemeanors
which
in
north
carolina
are
defined
as
offenses
punishable
by
as
much
as
two
years
in
prison.
indeed
that
is
exactly
this
case
and
that
is
how
it
originated.
i
think
it
is
quite
then
begs
the
question.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
on
the
drunk
driving
offense
itself
to
be
sure
the
legislator
has
since
revised
the
maximum
penalty
downward,
mr.
justice
brennan,
but
at
the
time
in
question
it
was
punishable
by
two
years.
there
is
no
doubt
or
fault
between
us.
that
the
sole
jurisdiction
in
the
first
instance
was
in
the
general
county
court
that
there
is
no
possible
relief
from
the
sanction
and
result
of
that
decision
in
the
county
court,
other
than
to
an
appeal
for
trial
de
novo.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
blackmun.
in
that
respect
i
think
the
clarification
we
were
seeking
earlier
may
be
in
front
of
us.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
that
of
course
is
a
possibility,
respectfully
mr.
chief
justice.
it
was
the
burden
of
the
state,
so
to
demonstrate
in
the
court
below
that
there
was
that
kind
of
evidence
in
front
of
the
superior
court
judge
not
present
before
the
county
court
judge.
that
evidence
was
not
produced.
it
now
is
a
matter
of
retrospective
idle
speculation
based
upon
the
subsequent
security
of
the
wrap
sheet
and
other
data
that,
that
is
a
possible
explanation.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
there
is,
it
has
been
made
available
to
me.
i
can
only
report
to
you
a
direct
quotation
from
a
federal
court
of
appeals
that
says
in
the
respect
“the
record
reveals
nothing
which
warrants
the
increased
punishment.”
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
i
have
not.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
it
was
not.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
it
is.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
indeed,
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
indeed,
i
do
not
rest
upon
this
outside
observation.
it
is
critical
to
an
affirmance
of
the
decision
below.
indeed,
a
reasonable
reading
of
the
decision
for
this
court
in
the
opinion
of
your
authorship
confines
that
permissibility
of
harsher
sentencing
pursuant
to
a
subsequent
trial
to
evidence
respecting
the
conduct
of
the
accused
which
conduct
must
itself
occur
subsequent
to
the
first
trial.
and
it
seems
to
me
in
retrospect
that
the
manner
in
which
that
line
was
drawn,
they
well
have
anticipated
this
kind
of
case
whereby
definition
when
the
retrial
occurs
in
a
more
formal
court,
following
a
trial
in
a
court
which
does
not
even
make
a
record,
necessarily
therefore
there
is
no
record
of
the
earlier
trial
for
the
superior
court
judge
to
compare
and
thus
to
determine
whether
there
has
been
new
evidence
introduce
respecting
aggravating
circumstances
of
a
crime
or
indeed
additional
data
respecting
the
background
of
the
accused.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
it
is
new,
in
no
respect
different.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
indeed,
that
possibility
is
there.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
i
think
that
is
certainly
among
the
questions
and
if
--
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
that
is
true
and
respectfully
i
do
wish
to
suggest
that
the
case
is
a
clearer
instance
than
pearce
itself,
but
this
is
an
instance
where
a
man
is
placed
in
jeopardy
of
a
substantial
penalty
without
even
the
rudimentary
safeguards
of
fourteenth
amendment
due
process.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
indeed,
but
mr.
justice
white,
is
it
not
in
fact
an
instance
where
the
state
first
submits
the
man
to
trial
with
no
election
for
trial
elsewhere
in
denial
of
his
constitutional
rights.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
i
think
it
is
a
crucial
part
to
the
case
unlike
the
outcome
in
the
court
below
quite
right
on
that
basis
below.
i
do
not
understand
how
any
reasonable
concept
of
due
process
can
contemplate
the
power
of
a
state
to
subject
a
man
to
trial
and
punishment
without
any
due
process.
indeed,
the
judge
may
not
be
law
trained,
i
take
exception
to
the
description
of
these
judges.
there
is
no
record
to
determine
the
voluntariness,
if
it
please
or
the
inadmissibility
of
evidence.
these
are
very
stripped
down
economically
operated
courts.
they
are
operated
now
as
the
state
concedes
without
access
to
trial
by
jury
with
offenses
punishable
by
two
years.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
i
think
the
harm
is
possible
and
addresses
itself
to
every
man’s
common
sense
that
to
the
extent
the
state
says
that
if
you
are
willing
to
succumb
to
the
punishment
that
has
been
imposed
upon
you
by
trading
off
that
which
the
fourteenth
amendment
guarantees
then
we
will
to
that
extent
insulate
you
from
the
risk
of
more
severe
treatment.
it
is
a
kind
of
bargain
that
is
made
in
the
background
without
any
of
the
overt
circumstances,
however,
which
might
ordinarily
participate
in
honest
guilty
plea
bargaining.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
there
is
no
election
here.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
it
seems
to
me
that
the
case
is
somewhat
different
and
it
is
harder
and
closer.
my
frank
position
would
be
that
result
should
be
the
same
because
i
do
think
that
there
are
other
course
in
these
elements
to
this
time
of
procedure.
but
it
is
true
that
if
we
had
an
election
in
the
first
instance,
respecting
the
court
in
which
you
might
first
be
tried,
there
would
be
less
reason
for
this
court
to
be
apprehensive
that
the
superior
court
judges
would
harbor
the
motive
to
discourage
seeking
access
to
the
district
court
in
the
first
instance
through
the
menace
diminish
hardship
sentencing.
it
is
also
true
that
with
that
election
in
front
of
him,
honestly
to
be
made,
in
the
initial
preference
for
the
district
court
it
may
consciously
be
entertained
by
the
accused
that
he
may
be
more
leniently
treated.
that
at
least
comes
closer
to
an
honest
kind
of
negotiation
of
election,
but
that
is
not
this
case.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
no,
my
objection
would
exist
quite
apart
from
pearce.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
yes,
(voice
overlap)
i
did
not
attempt
in
my
brief
--
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
indeed,
i
think
there
is
an
individual
--
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
mr.
justice
brennan
(voice
overlap)
question
of
law.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
respectfully
no
because
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
court
to
affirm
to
anticipate
a
next
case,
that
is
to
say
the
appropriate
case
in
which
this
issue
would
be
raised
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
well,
respectfully
i
think
it
has
separate
strength.
indeed
the
reasoning
of
pearce,
if
i
may
quote
the
court’s
opinion
was
this,
“due
process
of
law
requires
that
vindictiveness
against
a
defendant
for
having
successfully
attacked
this
first
conviction,
must
play
no
part
in
the
sentence
he
received
after
a
new
trial
and
since
the
fear
of
such
vindictiveness
may
constitutionally
deter
a
defendant's
exercise
of
the
right
to
appeal
or
collaterally
attack
his
first
conviction.
due
process
also
requires
that
a
defendant
be
freed
of
apprehension
of
such
retaliatory
motivation
on
the
part
of
the
sentencing
judge.”
now,
respectfully
i
submit
that,
that
at
least
is
the
rationale
of
due
process.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
indeed.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
yes.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
yes.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
it
is
still
leaves
a
constitutional
flaw
remaining
in
the
system
which
this
court
would
doubtless
have
to
consider
in
the
course
of
trail.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
indeed,
i
would.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
yes.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
that
is
correct.
i
have
no
doubt
that
they
are
consistent
with
united
states
versus
jackson.
there
is
now
a
fundamental
flaw.
now,
i
think
there
is
an
additional
relevance
to
that
observation.
mr.
safron
essentially
says
that
the
judicial
system
of
the
state
is
at
stake
to
the
extent
that
is
separately
flawed
because
of
this
observation
with
respecting
juries,
it
seems
to
me,
therefore,
we
cannot
argue
against
affirmance
in
this
instance
on
basis
of
preserving
a
system
which
already
has
at
fatal
flaw
in
it
and
will
require
some
immediate
revision.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
it
is
possible
mr.
chief
justice.
respectfully
that
argument
was
presented
by
counsel
for
the
state
of
north
carolina
in
pearce
itself.
a
speculation
was
made
that
if
this
court
were
to
accept
the
argument
at
that
time,
a
pernicious
reaction
might
set
in
among
superior
court
judges
always
in
the
first
instance
to
place
the
maximum
sentence
upon
the
accused.
it
is
my
opinion
therefore
that,
that
argument
having
been
made
previously
in
this
court
not
entertaining
and
quite
so
negative
in
attitude
for
the
superior
court
judges
and
observing
also
that
if
they
were
to
do
so,
if
anything,
it
would
then
merely
accelerate
and
prompt
further
appeals
in
every
instance
under
such
regime.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
the
remedy
is
to
permit
the
enhancement
of
sentence
only
by
a
mode
which
makes
practical
then,
a
subsequent
in
judicial
review.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
i
beg
your
pardon,
i
misunderstood.
the
appropriate
remedy
i
take
it
would
be
to
enter
a
contingent
order
of
habeas
if
that
is
the
way
the
case
came
up,
specifically
that
the
state
must
correct
the
record
and
reduce
the
sentence.
it
does
not
require
the
obliteration
of
the
finding
of
conviction.
i
agree
with
that
and
to
that
extent
i
think
that
there
was
a
clerical
error
by
the
fourth
circuit.
the
correction
to
be
made
is
the
correction
of
the
record
respecting
the
intensity
of
sentence.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
respectfully
mr.
chief
justice,
i
earnestly
do.
nothing
in
the
argument
presented
below,
nothing
in
the
fabric
of
pearce
suggests
that
a
conviction
subsequently
secured
pursuant
to
a
fair
trial
is
obliterated
or
that
all
go
free.
it
is
rather
that
the
excess
of
service
attributable
to
the
constitutionally
improper
harsher
sentence
must
be
relieved
to
the
extent,
therefore,
that
the
order
was
to
expunge
the
whole
conviction
rather
than
to
let
the
public
record
show
that
the
sentence
is
merely
that
originally
imposed
in
the
general
county
court.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
it
is
not.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
and
for
this
court
appropriately
in
the
disposition
of
the
case
to
note
that
and
call
for
its
correction
seems
to
me
eminently
appropriate.
there
is
nothing
in
the
argument
of
pearce
or
this
case
that
means
to
overthrow
the
conviction,
it
does.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
in
my
judgment
that
issue
was
an
honest
issue
which
was
litigated
in
the
fourth
circuit.
the
fourth
circuit
position
was
that
consistent
with
this
court’s
opinion
in
carafas
and
sibron
and
one
of
its
own
decisions,
a
case
called
hewett
versus
north
carolina,
the
citation
of
which
i
can
provide.
there
were
collateral
legal
consequences.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
i
beg
you
pardon.
in
the
argument
that
i
presented
respecting
mootness
to
the
fourth
circuit,
collaterally
legal
consequences,
assigned
to
record
of
sentence
that
the
degree
or
intensity
of
sentence
might
itself
have
traceable
collateral
legal
consequence.
one
of
these
of
course,
bears
upon
the
possibility
of
subsequent
conviction
for
another
offense,
that
sentence
imposed
pursuant
to
the
subsequent
conviction
might
foreseeably
of
course
be
harsher
than
it
would,
otherwise
in
light
of
previous
sentences,
that
is
to
say
not
really
the
record
of
conviction,
but
surely
the
degree
of
sentence,
the
severity,
a
punishment.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
yes,
respectfully.
i
do
not
mean
that
as
a
concession,
it
is
never
been
my
position
that
pearce
meant
anything
other
than
a
correction
of
the
sentence.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
the
mootness
issue
was
not
only,
not
raised
by
the
state
here
in
this
petition.
it
is
not
briefed,
and
therefore,
it
seems
to
me
unseemly
to
try
to
respond.
the
state
did
not
contest
the
viability
of
the
case
below.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
suspended
on
payment
of
$100.00
fine.
that
is
right.
it
was
position
in
the
fourth
circuit
that
consistent
with
sibron
and
carafas
that
is
a
foreseeable
collateral
legal
punishment.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
unfortunately
he
would
not.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
apparently
congress
authorizes
none
even
for
compensation
of
people
who
spent
time
in
deprivation
of
constitutional
rights,
there
is
no
remedy.
may
i
--
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
i
suppose
he
does
not.
he
has
been
unconditionally
released
by
the
state,
there
is
no
doubt
of
that.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
respectfully
mr.
justice
--
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
i
do
not
think
so.
i
think
if
the
court
will
attend
the
opinion
of
the
fourth
circuit,
the
opinion
is
exactly
modeled
on
pearce.
indeed,
the
court’s
reasons
parallels
pearce.
it
is
we
see
again
the
more
drastic
sentence
on
the
second
trial
as
a
denied
of
federal
due
process
and
by
discouragement
it
impinges
upon
the
state
given
appeal.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
nothing,
nothing.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
nothing.
i
can
assure
you
that
nothing
in
my
submission
or
in
the
briefs
submitted
to
the
fourth
circuit
invited
that
to
be
the
case.
i
merely
mean
to
suggest
that
in
the
appropriate
disposition
of
the
case,
surely
the
order
can
fittingly
be
described
so
to
cure
that
part
of
the
judgment.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
indeed.
yes.
may
i
observe
also
with
regard
to
the
alleged
parade
of
horribles
that
is
foreseen
to
flow
from
an
affirmance
in
that
regard
as
a
perfectly
ordinary
decision.
that
at
least
nine
states
sort
of
examined
this
problem
have
already
set
their
face
systematically
against
harsher
sentencing
even
in
the
context
of
these
absolute
rights
for
appeals
for
trial
de
novo.
five
of
these
have
based
it
on
pearce
itself
and
the
reasoning
is
identical
all
the
way
through.
indeed,
as
the
indiana
supreme
court
has
observed
this
year,
exactly
with
respect
to
this
situation.
“we
failed
to
see
whether
de
novo
aspect
of
the
trial
in
criminal
court
has
any
bearing
upon
the
logic
of
the
pearce
case
which
is
simply
that
the
threat
or
possibility
of
having
a
greater
sentence
imposed
should
not
be
a
deterrent
to
the
exercise
of
one's
right
of
appeal.
the
states
include
arizona
and
indiana,
hawaii
and
maryland.
new
mexico
by
statute
and
not
merely
by
judicial
fiat,
the
louisiana
since
about
1950
has
had
a
dual
trial
system,
but
under
a
construction
of
the
state’s
own
constitution,
has
for
more
than
a
decade
forbidden
harsher
sentencing.
the
alleged
parade
of
horribles
has
simply
not
materialized.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
indeed,
i
have
no
personal
doubt
that
there
are
many.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
yes.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
no,
i
would
have
to
answer
because
of
the
failure
of
district
courts
to
make
a
record
at
all
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
there
being
no
record
made
to
allow
a
subsequent
court
to
ascertain
the
--
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
no,
i
think
that
a
consistent
with
the
court’s
decision
in
parker
and
brady
and
mcminn
is
perfectly
possible
to
find
that
this
is
an
honest
bargain
that
the
accused
has
indeed
received
the
benefit
and
exchange
for
knowingly
giving
up
that
to
which
he
is
entitled.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
mr.
justice
white,
respectfully
there
is
no
possible
basis
for
binding
a
bargain.
mr.
rice
did
not
plea
guilty
and
he
had
no
election
to
be
tried
elsewhere.
he
pleaded
not
guilty.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
oh
it
seems
to
be
clearly,
not
sir.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
and
they
know
yours
and
indeed
one
has
had
to
incur
the
expense
and
the
delay
and
the
ordeal
and
the
harassment
of
the
first
trial.
it
is
just
no
one
threw
up
a
picket
fence
(voice
overlap).
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
yes,
indeed.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
i
do
not
know
whether
the
figures
are
even
available
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
suppose
that
it
is
relatively
a
substantial
percentage.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
i
cannot,
no
honestly
and
it
seems
a
sensible
guess
respectfully,
but
i
do
not
have
the
figures,
perhaps
mr.
safron
does.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
i
will
appreciate
assistance
by
counsel
of
the
state
because
i
am
not
certain
i
am
advised
by
some
local
attorneys
that
it
is
admissible,
but
i
do
not
know
that
and
would
willingly
stand
corrected
on
the
matter.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
i
do
not
know,
i
cannot
answer
that
clearly.
but
part
of
the
difficulty
is
again
that
there
simply
is
no
record
or
transcript
of
that
first
situation.
may
i,
in
a
few
remaining
moments
--
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
yes,
so
far
as
i
know
that
was
never
made
a
part
of
the
record
in
the
case
now
presented
to
the
court.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
yes.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
indeed,
there
was.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
indeed,
there
was.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
no,
i
do
not.
it
is
true
mr.
rice
is
represented
in
the
course
of
that
trial
by
court
assigned
counsel
as
well,
but
there
is
simply
no
record
with
(voice
overlap).
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
we
do
not.
a
question
was
raised
earlier
as
to
the
ascertain
frequency
of
harsher
sentencing
in
north
carolina
in
this
configuration
of
cases.
i
tried
to
determine
that
and
there
are
no
records
kept
of
this
matter.
indeed,
i
think
one
can
understand
the
readily
why,
since
the
general
county
court
and
now
the
district
court
makes
no
record
and
the
state
normally
treats
it
as
though
it
were
indeed
a
new
ball
game.
we
have
nothing
to
compare
to
work
that.
this
court
however
did
rely
upon
a
relatively
informal
survey
in
pearce
itself
that
was
published
in
the
court
journal,
finding
by
sample
of
the
judges
and
their
records
in
the
pearce
profile
allocations,
that
harsher
sentencing
was
imposed
upon
new
trial
in
roughly
70%
of
all
retrials
following
successful
appeal.
now,
i
am
not
a
practitioner
in
the
north
carolina
district
court.
i
can
merely
assure
the
court
that
there
is
wide
spread
interest
in
the
bar
because
it
is
habitual
for
attorneys
to
advise
the
clients
pursuant
to
the
district
court
proceeding.
and
unless
they
are
confident
of
success
there
ought
not
to
appeal
for
trial
de
novo
for
the
frequency
harsher
sentencing
is
believed
to
be
quite
widespread.
but
there
are
no
figures
available,
as
i
say
i
do
not
believe
that
the
condition
of
records
makes
it
possible
together
that
information
at
all.
respectfully
then,
i
want
to
return
to
our
regard
the
central
issue.
the
court
has
establish
a
set
of
sub-constitutional
courts
that
systematically
deny
an
accused
his
fundamental
fourteenth
amendment
safeguards.
it
does
not
give
him
an
opportunity
to
pray
that
off
against
the
superior
court.
this
is
not
a
case
of
bargaining
of
any
kind.
he
stood
upon
his
plea
of
innocence
and
he
sought
recourse
to
the
only
mechanism
which
the
state
possibly
allows
him.
the
state
then
essentially
sets
up
a
kind
of
electric
fence,
but
if
one
is
brazen
enough
to
press
forward
with
a
demand
for
rudimentary
fair
play,
he
is
made
to
take
the
risk
of
judicially
un-reviewable
and
unexplained
harsher
sentencing.
that
is
in
the
essence
is
this
case.
i
say
the
great
majority
of
case
state
supreme
courts,
not
federal
courts,
state
supreme
courts
which
have
reexamined
this
system
subsequent
to
pearce,
have
pronounced
it
absolutely
inadequate
and
i
can
anticipate
no
parade
of
horribles.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
the
sentence
respectfully
to
be
then
determined
and
imposed
by
whom
and
what
they
--
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
if
he
did
not
appeal
from
his
conviction
within
ten
days
sentence
will
then
be
imposed,
as
i
understand
and
the
question
is
--
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
yes,
i
think
that
raises
at
least
a
very
substantial
procedural
due
process
question.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
yes,
indeed.
i
think
the
hypothetical
is
very
well
taken.
the
question
for
this
court
is
to
extent
to
which
the
state
may
suspend
this
sort
of
damage
pleas
or
placing
the
accused
in
a
dilemma
for
a
certain
critical
period
of
time
and
i
would
have
serious
doubts
as
to
whether
that
procedure
in
the
absence
of
very
compelling
government
interest
to
be
served
which
i
can
discern
in
my
hypothetical
itself
should
be
allowed
consistent
with
the
due
process.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
i
do
indeed,
if
firm
figures
of
that
kind
would
be
forthcoming
in
a
given
piece
of
litigation
then
it
seems
to
me
at
least
to
yield
a
prima
facie
inference
of
punitive
original
sentencing
which
would
at
least
shift
a
burden
of
coming
forward
with
some
explanation
so
to
account
for
such
an
odd
and
peculiar
pattern.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
it
need
not
of
course.
the
extent
to
which
fourteenth
amendment
somehow
be
advocated
when
the
maximum
punishment
a
man
may
endure
may
be
as
light
as
90
days
is
of
course
an
open
question.
i
am
not
prepared
quite
frankly
to
take
position
that
no
aspect
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
whatever
applies
though
the
penalty
cannot
exceed
90
days.
possibly
counsel,
but
at
least
the
impartiality
of
the
trier
of
facts,
for
instance,
and
the
requisite
of
hearing
itself,
these
are
all
hardcore
elements
of
due
process
and
an
absolute
notion
that
they
can
all
universally
be
dispensed
with
because
a
man
may
be
subjected
to
no
more
that
90
days
laws
of
freedom.
it
strikes
me
as
quite
implausible
for
not
--
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
yes,
of
course.
that
serves
a
proper
rephrasing
of
it,
i
announce
a
view
i
suppose
in
taking
that
position.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
might
rather
than
launching
into
an
original
argument,
attempt
to
respond
to
some
of
the
questions
which
were
directed
to
mr.
safron,
simply
by
way
of
helpful
clarification.
so
far
as
the
technicality
of
what
it
is
called
in
16
(a)
new
trial
against
the
correction
of
what
he
may
believe
to
be
an
injustice
committed
in
the
course
of
his
original
trial,
in
the
general
county
court
or
now
in
the
district
court,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
even
in
the
view
of
state
itself
it
is
an
appeal.
indeed
or
by
turning
to
page
17
of
petitioner’s
appendix,
one
of
the
note
that
the
statute
so
defined
it
itself,
it
is
called
an
appeal
to
the
superior
court,
subsequently
appeal
from
district
court,
subsequently
appeal
from
justice
trial
de
novo.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
indeed,
that
is
--
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
unquestionably
correct.
what
needs
to
be
observed
side
by
side
that
observation,
however,
is
it
that
it
is
also
the
exclusive
recourse
one
has
from
any
grievance
which
he
may
honestly
feel
to
pervade
that
original
trial.
in
this
respect
it
seems
to
me
therefore
most
important
that
one
take
the
accurate
measure
of
the
character
of
the
court
in
which
he
is
first
tried.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
that
is
the
case.
that
is
correct,
there
is
no
other
recourse.
the
court
in
which
he
is
first
tried
is
not
a
court
that
merely
tries
petty
offenses.
i
quite
take
exception
to
that
description.
indeed
the
original
and
exclusive
jurisdiction,
original
and
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
a
district
court
runs
to
misdemeanors
which
in
north
carolina
are
defined
as
offenses
punishable
by
as
much
as
two
years
in
prison.
indeed
that
is
exactly
this
case
and
that
is
how
it
originated.
i
think
it
is
quite
then
begs
the
question.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
on
the
drunk
driving
offense
itself
to
be
sure
the
legislator
has
since
revised
the
maximum
penalty
downward,
mr.
justice
brennan,
but
at
the
time
in
question
it
was
punishable
by
two
years.
there
is
no
doubt
or
fault
between
us.
that
the
sole
jurisdiction
in
the
first
instance
was
in
the
general
county
court
that
there
is
no
possible
relief
from
the
sanction
and
result
of
that
decision
in
the
county
court,
other
than
to
an
appeal
for
trial
de
novo.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
blackmun.
in
that
respect
i
think
the
clarification
we
were
seeking
earlier
may
be
in
front
of
us.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
that
of
course
is
a
possibility,
respectfully
mr.
chief
justice.
it
was
the
burden
of
the
state,
so
to
demonstrate
in
the
court
below
that
there
was
that
kind
of
evidence
in
front
of
the
superior
court
judge
not
present
before
the
county
court
judge.
that
evidence
was
not
produced.
it
now
is
a
matter
of
retrospective
idle
speculation
based
upon
the
subsequent
security
of
the
wrap
sheet
and
other
data
that,
that
is
a
possible
explanation.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
there
is,
it
has
been
made
available
to
me.
i
can
only
report
to
you
a
direct
quotation
from
a
federal
court
of
appeals
that
says
in
the
respect
“the
record
reveals
nothing
which
warrants
the
increased
punishment.”
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
i
have
not.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
it
was
not.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
it
is.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
indeed,
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
indeed,
i
do
not
rest
upon
this
outside
observation.
it
is
critical
to
an
affirmance
of
the
decision
below.
indeed,
a
reasonable
reading
of
the
decision
for
this
court
in
the
opinion
of
your
authorship
confines
that
permissibility
of
harsher
sentencing
pursuant
to
a
subsequent
trial
to
evidence
respecting
the
conduct
of
the
accused
which
conduct
must
itself
occur
subsequent
to
the
first
trial.
and
it
seems
to
me
in
retrospect
that
the
manner
in
which
that
line
was
drawn,
they
well
have
anticipated
this
kind
of
case
whereby
definition
when
the
retrial
occurs
in
a
more
formal
court,
following
a
trial
in
a
court
which
does
not
even
make
a
record,
necessarily
therefore
there
is
no
record
of
the
earlier
trial
for
the
superior
court
judge
to
compare
and
thus
to
determine
whether
there
has
been
new
evidence
introduce
respecting
aggravating
circumstances
of
a
crime
or
indeed
additional
data
respecting
the
background
of
the
accused.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
it
is
new,
in
no
respect
different.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
indeed,
that
possibility
is
there.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
i
think
that
is
certainly
among
the
questions
and
if
--
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
that
is
true
and
respectfully
i
do
wish
to
suggest
that
the
case
is
a
clearer
instance
than
pearce
itself,
but
this
is
an
instance
where
a
man
is
placed
in
jeopardy
of
a
substantial
penalty
without
even
the
rudimentary
safeguards
of
fourteenth
amendment
due
process.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
indeed,
but
mr.
justice
white,
is
it
not
in
fact
an
instance
where
the
state
first
submits
the
man
to
trial
with
no
election
for
trial
elsewhere
in
denial
of
his
constitutional
rights.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
i
think
it
is
a
crucial
part
to
the
case
unlike
the
outcome
in
the
court
below
quite
right
on
that
basis
below.
i
do
not
understand
how
any
reasonable
concept
of
due
process
can
contemplate
the
power
of
a
state
to
subject
a
man
to
trial
and
punishment
without
any
due
process.
indeed,
the
judge
may
not
be
law
trained,
i
take
exception
to
the
description
of
these
judges.
there
is
no
record
to
determine
the
voluntariness,
if
it
please
or
the
inadmissibility
of
evidence.
these
are
very
stripped
down
economically
operated
courts.
they
are
operated
now
as
the
state
concedes
without
access
to
trial
by
jury
with
offenses
punishable
by
two
years.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
i
think
the
harm
is
possible
and
addresses
itself
to
every
man’s
common
sense
that
to
the
extent
the
state
says
that
if
you
are
willing
to
succumb
to
the
punishment
that
has
been
imposed
upon
you
by
trading
off
that
which
the
fourteenth
amendment
guarantees
then
we
will
to
that
extent
insulate
you
from
the
risk
of
more
severe
treatment.
it
is
a
kind
of
bargain
that
is
made
in
the
background
without
any
of
the
overt
circumstances,
however,
which
might
ordinarily
participate
in
honest
guilty
plea
bargaining.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
there
is
no
election
here.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
it
seems
to
me
that
the
case
is
somewhat
different
and
it
is
harder
and
closer.
my
frank
position
would
be
that
result
should
be
the
same
because
i
do
think
that
there
are
other
course
in
these
elements
to
this
time
of
procedure.
but
it
is
true
that
if
we
had
an
election
in
the
first
instance,
respecting
the
court
in
which
you
might
first
be
tried,
there
would
be
less
reason
for
this
court
to
be
apprehensive
that
the
superior
court
judges
would
harbor
the
motive
to
discourage
seeking
access
to
the
district
court
in
the
first
instance
through
the
menace
diminish
hardship
sentencing.
it
is
also
true
that
with
that
election
in
front
of
him,
honestly
to
be
made,
in
the
initial
preference
for
the
district
court
it
may
consciously
be
entertained
by
the
accused
that
he
may
be
more
leniently
treated.
that
at
least
comes
closer
to
an
honest
kind
of
negotiation
of
election,
but
that
is
not
this
case.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
no,
my
objection
would
exist
quite
apart
from
pearce.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
yes,
(voice
overlap)
i
did
not
attempt
in
my
brief
--
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
indeed,
i
think
there
is
an
individual
--
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
mr.
justice
brennan
(voice
overlap)
question
of
law.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
respectfully
no
because
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
court
to
affirm
to
anticipate
a
next
case,
that
is
to
say
the
appropriate
case
in
which
this
issue
would
be
raised
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
well,
respectfully
i
think
it
has
separate
strength.
indeed
the
reasoning
of
pearce,
if
i
may
quote
the
court’s
opinion
was
this,
“due
process
of
law
requires
that
vindictiveness
against
a
defendant
for
having
successfully
attacked
this
first
conviction,
must
play
no
part
in
the
sentence
he
received
after
a
new
trial
and
since
the
fear
of
such
vindictiveness
may
constitutionally
deter
a
defendant's
exercise
of
the
right
to
appeal
or
collaterally
attack
his
first
conviction.
due
process
also
requires
that
a
defendant
be
freed
of
apprehension
of
such
retaliatory
motivation
on
the
part
of
the
sentencing
judge.”
now,
respectfully
i
submit
that,
that
at
least
is
the
rationale
of
due
process.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
indeed.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
yes.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
yes.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
it
is
still
leaves
a
constitutional
flaw
remaining
in
the
system
which
this
court
would
doubtless
have
to
consider
in
the
course
of
trail.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
indeed,
i
would.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
yes.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
that
is
correct.
i
have
no
doubt
that
they
are
consistent
with
united
states
versus
jackson.
there
is
now
a
fundamental
flaw.
now,
i
think
there
is
an
additional
relevance
to
that
observation.
mr.
safron
essentially
says
that
the
judicial
system
of
the
state
is
at
stake
to
the
extent
that
is
separately
flawed
because
of
this
observation
with
respecting
juries,
it
seems
to
me,
therefore,
we
cannot
argue
against
affirmance
in
this
instance
on
basis
of
preserving
a
system
which
already
has
at
fatal
flaw
in
it
and
will
require
some
immediate
revision.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
it
is
possible
mr.
chief
justice.
respectfully
that
argument
was
presented
by
counsel
for
the
state
of
north
carolina
in
pearce
itself.
a
speculation
was
made
that
if
this
court
were
to
accept
the
argument
at
that
time,
a
pernicious
reaction
might
set
in
among
superior
court
judges
always
in
the
first
instance
to
place
the
maximum
sentence
upon
the
accused.
it
is
my
opinion
therefore
that,
that
argument
having
been
made
previously
in
this
court
not
entertaining
and
quite
so
negative
in
attitude
for
the
superior
court
judges
and
observing
also
that
if
they
were
to
do
so,
if
anything,
it
would
then
merely
accelerate
and
prompt
further
appeals
in
every
instance
under
such
regime.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
the
remedy
is
to
permit
the
enhancement
of
sentence
only
by
a
mode
which
makes
practical
then,
a
subsequent
in
judicial
review.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
i
beg
your
pardon,
i
misunderstood.
the
appropriate
remedy
i
take
it
would
be
to
enter
a
contingent
order
of
habeas
if
that
is
the
way
the
case
came
up,
specifically
that
the
state
must
correct
the
record
and
reduce
the
sentence.
it
does
not
require
the
obliteration
of
the
finding
of
conviction.
i
agree
with
that
and
to
that
extent
i
think
that
there
was
a
clerical
error
by
the
fourth
circuit.
the
correction
to
be
made
is
the
correction
of
the
record
respecting
the
intensity
of
sentence.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
respectfully
mr.
chief
justice,
i
earnestly
do.
nothing
in
the
argument
presented
below,
nothing
in
the
fabric
of
pearce
suggests
that
a
conviction
subsequently
secured
pursuant
to
a
fair
trial
is
obliterated
or
that
all
go
free.
it
is
rather
that
the
excess
of
service
attributable
to
the
constitutionally
improper
harsher
sentence
must
be
relieved
to
the
extent,
therefore,
that
the
order
was
to
expunge
the
whole
conviction
rather
than
to
let
the
public
record
show
that
the
sentence
is
merely
that
originally
imposed
in
the
general
county
court.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
it
is
not.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
and
for
this
court
appropriately
in
the
disposition
of
the
case
to
note
that
and
call
for
its
correction
seems
to
me
eminently
appropriate.
there
is
nothing
in
the
argument
of
pearce
or
this
case
that
means
to
overthrow
the
conviction,
it
does.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
in
my
judgment
that
issue
was
an
honest
issue
which
was
litigated
in
the
fourth
circuit.
the
fourth
circuit
position
was
that
consistent
with
this
court’s
opinion
in
carafas
and
sibron
and
one
of
its
own
decisions,
a
case
called
hewett
versus
north
carolina,
the
citation
of
which
i
can
provide.
there
were
collateral
legal
consequences.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
i
beg
you
pardon.
in
the
argument
that
i
presented
respecting
mootness
to
the
fourth
circuit,
collaterally
legal
consequences,
assigned
to
record
of
sentence
that
the
degree
or
intensity
of
sentence
might
itself
have
traceable
collateral
legal
consequence.
one
of
these
of
course,
bears
upon
the
possibility
of
subsequent
conviction
for
another
offense,
that
sentence
imposed
pursuant
to
the
subsequent
conviction
might
foreseeably
of
course
be
harsher
than
it
would,
otherwise
in
light
of
previous
sentences,
that
is
to
say
not
really
the
record
of
conviction,
but
surely
the
degree
of
sentence,
the
severity,
a
punishment.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
yes,
respectfully.
i
do
not
mean
that
as
a
concession,
it
is
never
been
my
position
that
pearce
meant
anything
other
than
a
correction
of
the
sentence.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
the
mootness
issue
was
not
only,
not
raised
by
the
state
here
in
this
petition.
it
is
not
briefed,
and
therefore,
it
seems
to
me
unseemly
to
try
to
respond.
the
state
did
not
contest
the
viability
of
the
case
below.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
suspended
on
payment
of
$100.00
fine.
that
is
right.
it
was
position
in
the
fourth
circuit
that
consistent
with
sibron
and
carafas
that
is
a
foreseeable
collateral
legal
punishment.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
unfortunately
he
would
not.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
apparently
congress
authorizes
none
even
for
compensation
of
people
who
spent
time
in
deprivation
of
constitutional
rights,
there
is
no
remedy.
may
i
--
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
i
suppose
he
does
not.
he
has
been
unconditionally
released
by
the
state,
there
is
no
doubt
of
that.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
respectfully
mr.
justice
--
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
i
do
not
think
so.
i
think
if
the
court
will
attend
the
opinion
of
the
fourth
circuit,
the
opinion
is
exactly
modeled
on
pearce.
indeed,
the
court’s
reasons
parallels
pearce.
it
is
we
see
again
the
more
drastic
sentence
on
the
second
trial
as
a
denied
of
federal
due
process
and
by
discouragement
it
impinges
upon
the
state
given
appeal.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
nothing,
nothing.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
nothing.
i
can
assure
you
that
nothing
in
my
submission
or
in
the
briefs
submitted
to
the
fourth
circuit
invited
that
to
be
the
case.
i
merely
mean
to
suggest
that
in
the
appropriate
disposition
of
the
case,
surely
the
order
can
fittingly
be
described
so
to
cure
that
part
of
the
judgment.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
indeed.
yes.
may
i
observe
also
with
regard
to
the
alleged
parade
of
horribles
that
is
foreseen
to
flow
from
an
affirmance
in
that
regard
as
a
perfectly
ordinary
decision.
that
at
least
nine
states
sort
of
examined
this
problem
have
already
set
their
face
systematically
against
harsher
sentencing
even
in
the
context
of
these
absolute
rights
for
appeals
for
trial
de
novo.
five
of
these
have
based
it
on
pearce
itself
and
the
reasoning
is
identical
all
the
way
through.
indeed,
as
the
indiana
supreme
court
has
observed
this
year,
exactly
with
respect
to
this
situation.
“we
failed
to
see
whether
de
novo
aspect
of
the
trial
in
criminal
court
has
any
bearing
upon
the
logic
of
the
pearce
case
which
is
simply
that
the
threat
or
possibility
of
having
a
greater
sentence
imposed
should
not
be
a
deterrent
to
the
exercise
of
one's
right
of
appeal.
the
states
include
arizona
and
indiana,
hawaii
and
maryland.
new
mexico
by
statute
and
not
merely
by
judicial
fiat,
the
louisiana
since
about
1950
has
had
a
dual
trial
system,
but
under
a
construction
of
the
state’s
own
constitution,
has
for
more
than
a
decade
forbidden
harsher
sentencing.
the
alleged
parade
of
horribles
has
simply
not
materialized.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
indeed,
i
have
no
personal
doubt
that
there
are
many.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
yes.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
no,
i
would
have
to
answer
because
of
the
failure
of
district
courts
to
make
a
record
at
all
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
there
being
no
record
made
to
allow
a
subsequent
court
to
ascertain
the
--
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
no,
i
think
that
a
consistent
with
the
court’s
decision
in
parker
and
brady
and
mcminn
is
perfectly
possible
to
find
that
this
is
an
honest
bargain
that
the
accused
has
indeed
received
the
benefit
and
exchange
for
knowingly
giving
up
that
to
which
he
is
entitled.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
mr.
justice
white,
respectfully
there
is
no
possible
basis
for
binding
a
bargain.
mr.
rice
did
not
plea
guilty
and
he
had
no
election
to
be
tried
elsewhere.
he
pleaded
not
guilty.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
oh
it
seems
to
be
clearly,
not
sir.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
and
they
know
yours
and
indeed
one
has
had
to
incur
the
expense
and
the
delay
and
the
ordeal
and
the
harassment
of
the
first
trial.
it
is
just
no
one
threw
up
a
picket
fence
(voice
overlap).
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
yes,
indeed.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
i
do
not
know
whether
the
figures
are
even
available
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
suppose
that
it
is
relatively
a
substantial
percentage.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
i
cannot,
no
honestly
and
it
seems
a
sensible
guess
respectfully,
but
i
do
not
have
the
figures,
perhaps
mr.
safron
does.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
i
will
appreciate
assistance
by
counsel
of
the
state
because
i
am
not
certain
i
am
advised
by
some
local
attorneys
that
it
is
admissible,
but
i
do
not
know
that
and
would
willingly
stand
corrected
on
the
matter.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
i
do
not
know,
i
cannot
answer
that
clearly.
but
part
of
the
difficulty
is
again
that
there
simply
is
no
record
or
transcript
of
that
first
situation.
may
i,
in
a
few
remaining
moments
--
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
yes,
so
far
as
i
know
that
was
never
made
a
part
of
the
record
in
the
case
now
presented
to
the
court.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
yes.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
indeed,
there
was.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
indeed,
there
was.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
no,
i
do
not.
it
is
true
mr.
rice
is
represented
in
the
course
of
that
trial
by
court
assigned
counsel
as
well,
but
there
is
simply
no
record
with
(voice
overlap).
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
we
do
not.
a
question
was
raised
earlier
as
to
the
ascertain
frequency
of
harsher
sentencing
in
north
carolina
in
this
configuration
of
cases.
i
tried
to
determine
that
and
there
are
no
records
kept
of
this
matter.
indeed,
i
think
one
can
understand
the
readily
why,
since
the
general
county
court
and
now
the
district
court
makes
no
record
and
the
state
normally
treats
it
as
though
it
were
indeed
a
new
ball
game.
we
have
nothing
to
compare
to
work
that.
this
court
however
did
rely
upon
a
relatively
informal
survey
in
pearce
itself
that
was
published
in
the
court
journal,
finding
by
sample
of
the
judges
and
their
records
in
the
pearce
profile
allocations,
that
harsher
sentencing
was
imposed
upon
new
trial
in
roughly
70%
of
all
retrials
following
successful
appeal.
now,
i
am
not
a
practitioner
in
the
north
carolina
district
court.
i
can
merely
assure
the
court
that
there
is
wide
spread
interest
in
the
bar
because
it
is
habitual
for
attorneys
to
advise
the
clients
pursuant
to
the
district
court
proceeding.
and
unless
they
are
confident
of
success
there
ought
not
to
appeal
for
trial
de
novo
for
the
frequency
harsher
sentencing
is
believed
to
be
quite
widespread.
but
there
are
no
figures
available,
as
i
say
i
do
not
believe
that
the
condition
of
records
makes
it
possible
together
that
information
at
all.
respectfully
then,
i
want
to
return
to
our
regard
the
central
issue.
the
court
has
establish
a
set
of
sub-constitutional
courts
that
systematically
deny
an
accused
his
fundamental
fourteenth
amendment
safeguards.
it
does
not
give
him
an
opportunity
to
pray
that
off
against
the
superior
court.
this
is
not
a
case
of
bargaining
of
any
kind.
he
stood
upon
his
plea
of
innocence
and
he
sought
recourse
to
the
only
mechanism
which
the
state
possibly
allows
him.
the
state
then
essentially
sets
up
a
kind
of
electric
fence,
but
if
one
is
brazen
enough
to
press
forward
with
a
demand
for
rudimentary
fair
play,
he
is
made
to
take
the
risk
of
judicially
un-reviewable
and
unexplained
harsher
sentencing.
that
is
in
the
essence
is
this
case.
i
say
the
great
majority
of
case
state
supreme
courts,
not
federal
courts,
state
supreme
courts
which
have
reexamined
this
system
subsequent
to
pearce,
have
pronounced
it
absolutely
inadequate
and
i
can
anticipate
no
parade
of
horribles.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
the
sentence
respectfully
to
be
then
determined
and
imposed
by
whom
and
what
they
--
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
if
he
did
not
appeal
from
his
conviction
within
ten
days
sentence
will
then
be
imposed,
as
i
understand
and
the
question
is
--
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
yes,
i
think
that
raises
at
least
a
very
substantial
procedural
due
process
question.
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
yes,
indeed.
i
think
the
hypothetical
is
very
well
taken.
the
question
for
this
court
is
to
extent
to
which
the
state
may
suspend
this
sort
of
damage
pleas
or
placing
the
accused
in
a
dilemma
for
a
certain
critical
period
of
time
and
i
would
have
serious
doubts
as
to
whether
that
procedure
in
the
absence
of
very
compelling
government
interest
to
be
served
which
i
can
discern
in
my
hypothetical
itself
should
be
allowed
consistent
with
the
due
process.

i
do
indeed,
if
firm
figures
of
that
kind
would
be
forthcoming
in
a
given
piece
of
litigation
then
it
seems
to
me
at
least
to
yield
a
prima
facie
inference
of
punitive
original
sentencing
which
would
at
least
shift
a
burden
of
coming
forward
with
some
explanation
so
to
account
for
such
an
odd
and
peculiar
pattern.
mr.

it
need
not
of
course.
the
extent
to
which
fourteenth
amendment
somehow
be
advocated
when
the
maximum
punishment
a
man
may
endure
may
be
as
light
as
90
days
is
of
course
an
open
question.
i
am
not
prepared
quite
frankly
to
take
position
that
no
aspect
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
whatever
applies
though
the
penalty
cannot
exceed
90
days.
possibly
counsel,
but
at
least
the
impartiality
of
the
trier
of
facts,
for
instance,
and
the
requisite
of
hearing
itself,
these
are
all
hardcore
elements
of
due
process
and
an
absolute
notion
that
they
can
all
universally
be
dispensed
with
because
a
man
may
be
subjected
to
no
more
that
90
days
laws
of
freedom.
it
strikes
me
as
quite
implausible
for
not
--
mr.
william
w.
van
alstyne
yes,
of
course.
that
serves
a
proper
rephrasing
of
it,
i
announce
a
view
i
suppose
in
taking
that
position.
