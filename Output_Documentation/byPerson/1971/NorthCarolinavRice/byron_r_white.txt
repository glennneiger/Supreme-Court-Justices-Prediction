justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
safron,
what
offense,
could
it
the
other,
what
offenses
are
subject
first
to
trial
in
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
the
district
court,
in
any
other
case
tried
is
district
court,
no
right
to
trial
by
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
know
how
recurring
it
is
--
the
sentences
in
the
superior
court
are
considerably
higher
that
in
the
district
court
and
how
the
courts
do
the
same
in
the
same
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
you
really
would
not
be
here,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
57%
are
cases
that
came
from
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
one
thing,
how
would
you
describe
north
carolina’s
statute
in
not
being
descriptive,
in
effect
it
was
when
they
came
that
rather
than
the
supreme
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
want
to
say
that
you
would
like
to
handle
the
great
(inaudible)
in
criminal
litigation
without
a
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
judge
was
not
less
in
the
district
court
and
in
superior
court
perhaps
it
would
be
satisfied
if
you
tried
it
on
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
case
that
to
have
this
system
that
you
have,
but
to
have
a
formal
rule
that
on
re-trial
de
novo,
the
sentence
may
not
be
larger
than
what
is
imposed
below?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
i
take
it
that
the
trial
de
novo
was
(inaudible)
i
mean,
there
is
no
(inaudible)
as
you
set
aside
as
error,
it
is
questionably
viewing
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
like
that,
it
is
a
brand
new
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
i
think
that
one
has
to
deal
with
the
superior
court
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
not
really
the
question
here
whether
the
state
may
impose
between
him
and
a
constitutional
trial,
a
trial
in
the
district
court
without
a
jury
and
a
without
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
not
a
little
different
question
than
your
pearce
argument
which
really
an
expected
argument
a
deal
and
just
following
the
rule
of
pearce.
the
real
problem
here
is
that
he
could
not
get
the
superior
court
in
the
first
place.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
he
could
point
it
out
without
any
problem?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
point
is
that
--
your
real
point
is
that
if
he
runs
to
this
mode
twice,
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
identify
the
harm
raised
to
the
defendant
when
he
first
subject
to
a
trial
by
district
court
before
he
can
get
to
superior
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
have
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
to
make
the
same
argument
that
the
defendant
has
a
choice
in
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
your
argument,
i
do
not
see
how
the
pearce
rationale
really
solve
the,
you
make
this
objection?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
even
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
correct,
even
if
we
affirm
this
case,
it
seems
to
me
that
basic
objection
to
the
two
tier
procedure
still
remain.
justice
byron
r.
white
without
this
basic
objection
it
seems
to
be
that
pearce
point
--
that
the
pearce
point
is
only
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
would
not
be
expunging
in
two
years,
it
would
just
be
say,
it
should
have
been
nine
months?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
us
assume
it
was
decided
that
his
confinement
beyond
nine
months
is
unconstitutional,
would
he
have
any
civil
remedy
against
the
north
carolina
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)there
is
no
provision
for
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
are
--
you
are
assuming
here
that
the
convictions
are
valid?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
there
any
plea
bargains
in
the
district
courts?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
us
assume
there
is
an
outright
bargain
which
is
you
plead
guilty
and
you
get
nine
months
and
they
present
it
to
the
judge
and
the
judge
says
alright
that
is
satisfactory
and
everybody’s
perfectly
of
--
and
then
he
exercise
his
right
to
appeal.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then,
you
would
make
the
same
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
us
assume
everybody
agrees
that,
i
mean,
on
a
habeas
corpus
after
his
conviction
in
higher
sentence
in
the
superior
court,
the
record
is
perfectly
clear.
if
there
was
a
plea
bargain,
everybody
testifies.
the
facts
are
clear
and
he
says
nevertheless
i
am
limited,
limited
to
nine
months?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
do
not
think
that
this
whole
system
can
be
interpreted
there
is
sort
of
an
enormous
plea
bargain
in
the
sense
that
they
are
saying
to
him
we
are
going
to
run
you
through.
let
us
assume
the
state
says
we
are
going
to
have
an
administrative
determination
of
your
guilt
and
then
a
suggested
sentence.
if
you
are
satisfied
with
it
you
take
it.
if
not
satisfied
with
it,
you
get
a
trial
by
jury.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
choice
not
after
the
district
court
trial
more
effective
than
the
choice
before?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
you
know
the
state
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
terms
of
a
due
process
choice
it
is
better
afterwards
than
before?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
after
this
there
has
been
an
error
on
the
retrial
the
superior
court,
if
he
still
can
produce
evidence
of
what
his
testimony
was
in
the
district
court,
is
that
admissible?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
ask
you
this,
let
us
assume
that
north
carolina
has
the
system
of
trying
people
in
the
district
court
and
having
assigned
them
(inaudible)
that
postponed
the
sentencing
and
then
trying
to
appeal
and
to
appeal
from
your
conviction.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
by
then
i
get
to
--
you
could
appeal
from
your
conviction
or
you
can
appeal
with
your
sentence.
now,
if
he
did
not
appeal
for
this
conviction
within
ten
days
then
he
accepted
in
the
district
court,
but
the
conviction
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
does
conviction
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
believe
in
fact
that
the
question
(voice
overlap)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
your
argument
though
right
across
the
board
in
so-called
petty
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
safron,
what
offense,
could
it
the
other,
what
offenses
are
subject
first
to
trial
in
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
the
district
court,
in
any
other
case
tried
is
district
court,
no
right
to
trial
by
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
know
how
recurring
it
is
--
the
sentences
in
the
superior
court
are
considerably
higher
that
in
the
district
court
and
how
the
courts
do
the
same
in
the
same
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
you
really
would
not
be
here,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
57%
are
cases
that
came
from
the
district
court?
justice
byron

how

that
you

to
handle
the
great
(inaudible)
in
criminal
litigation
without
a

justice

the
judge
was
not

and
in

perhaps
it
would

how
about
the

that
to

it

a

in

without

and
a
without

justice
byron

white
is
that
not
a

different
question
than
your
pearce
argument
which
really
an
expected
argument
a
deal
and
just
following
the
rule
of
pearce.
the
real
problem
here
is
that
he
could
not
get
the
superior
court
in
the
first

justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
he
could
point
it
out
without
any
problem?
justice
byron

your
point
is
that
--
your
real
point
is
that
if
he
runs
to
this

twice,
(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
identify
the
harm
raised
to
the

when
he
first
subject
to
a

by

before
he
can
get
to

justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
have
(voice

justice
byron

white
you
have
to
make
the
same
argument
that
the
defendant
has
a
choice
in
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
your
argument,
i
do
not
see
how
the
pearce
rationale
really
solve
the,
you
make
this
objection?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
even
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
correct,
even
if
we
affirm
this
case,
it
seems
to
me
that
basic
objection
to
the
two

still
remain.
justice
byron

without
this
basic

it
seems
to
be
that

that

justice

(voice

so,
you
are

you

any

if
there

the
facts
are
clear
and
he
says
nevertheless
i
am
limited,
limited
to
nine

and
you
do
not

justice

is
the
choice
not
after
the
district

trial
more
effective
than
the
choice
before?
justice
byron

white
why
not?
you
know
the
state
case?
justice
byron

in

of
a

choice
it
is
better
afterwards
than
before?
justice
byron

yes.
justice

i

after

if

well,
by
then
i
get
to
--
you
could
appeal
from
your
conviction
or
you
can
appeal
with
your
sentence.
now,
if
he
did
not
appeal
for
this
conviction
within

then
he
accepted
in

the
