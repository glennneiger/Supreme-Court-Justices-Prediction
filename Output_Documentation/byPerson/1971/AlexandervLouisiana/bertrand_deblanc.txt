mr.
bertrand
deblanc
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
like
to
just,
excuse
me,
take
my
breathe.
although,
i
have
been
here
three
times,
of
course
--
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
i
have
been
here
three
times.
first
time
it
was
as
justice
douglas
remembers,
i
was
here
representing
an
accused
who
had
been
electrocuted
by
the
state,
cannot
be
electrocuted
by
the
state
once
and
they
were
trying
to
electrocute
him
the
second
time
and
i
was
here
to
plead
but
--
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
that
is
right,
your
honor.
we
were
not
successful,
but
we
had
you
on
our
side.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
yes.
very
good.
if
your
honors,
please,
i
would
like
to
start
off
with
the
first
point
and
there
are
three
points
involved
here,
the
first
one
being
that
they
are
all
complaining
that
there
was
a
systematic
exclusion
of
negroes
on
the
grand
jury,
the
second
being
systematic
exclusion
of
women
and
the
third
of
being
the
failure
to
comply
with
miranda.
so
i
would
like
to
begin
with
the
first
point
and
say
this
that
i
came
here
today
not
to
defend
the
commission
or
the
clerk
at
court
who
was
a
member,
but
to
praise
him
in
the
manner
in
which
he
selected
names
to
be
considered
for
the
grand
jury
as
well
as
the
petit
jury,
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
complaint
here
is
strictly
to
the
grand
jury.
he
is
not
complaining
that
there
was
a
--
that
the
trial
was
not
fair
or
that
there
was
anything
wrong
with
the
petit
jury,
but
simply
to
the
grand
jury.
the
clerk
of
court
began,
as
he
said
to
attempt
to
get
as
wide
the
range
of
persons
as
he
could
to
consider
for
a
grand
jury
and
petit
jury
service
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
he
sent
out
11,000
questionnaires
in
a
parish,
a
county
we
call
it
parish
here
in
louisiana,
but
where
there
was
40,000
population,
he
sent
out
11,000
questionnaires
according
to
his
testimony
which
is
in
the
record
here
and
incidentally
the
record
was
compiled
by
the
complainants
and
we
are
going
to
court
on
the
record
that
they
have
got,
they
have
complied
and
submitted.
but
there
were
11,000
questionnaires
mailed
out,
out
of
the
total
of
40,000
persons
in
the
parish
of
which
there
were
21,000
males.
he
sent
out
this
only
to
the
male
population.
although,
we
did
have
a
place
to
show
whether
they
were
male
or
female
because
the
clerk
did
attempt
and
it
is
shown
in
the
record
that
the
clerk
did
attempt
to
get
women
interested
in
jury
service.
as
the
record
will
show
that
he
talked
to
my
assistant
who
happens
to
be
a
lady,
an
assistant
district
attorney
there
and
trying
to
get
her
to
talk
to
the
women’s
clubs
and
get
them
interested
in
that
and
the
reason,
he
said
in
the
records,
they
had
not
done
it
before
was
because
we
had
an
old
courthouse
which
has
no
facilities
to
help
to
--
for
women
jurors,
but
that
was
going
to
--
were
being
built
at
the
time
a
new
courthouse.
and
at
the
time
that
the
case
was
tried
we
tried
it
in
the
new
courthouse,
but
at
the
time
that
the
selection
was
made
we
were
in
the
temporary
courthouse
at
that
particular
time,
but
he
did
try
to
get
the
assistant
district
attorney
to
get
the
ladies
interested.
now,
to
go
over
this
there
were
21,000
males
in
the
parish
and
there
were
17,000
white
and
about
4,000
negroes
which
amounted
to
20%
negro
and
so
far
as
the
male
population
was
concerned.
then
he
has
the
registered
voters
here,
we
will
show
it
that
there
were
a
total
of
6,541
negroes
who
were
registered
out
of
the
total
population
of
9,000.
so
there
are
--
the
entire
--
the
population
of
this
parish
is
very
highly
registered
both
white
and
negro
because
out
of
the
9,400
negroes
in
the
parish
there
were
6,500
registered
voters
and
there
were
3,573
negro
males
in
the
parish
and
17,000
white
males
in
the
parish.
now,
he
sent
out
11,000
of
these
questionnaires
and
he
went
around
looking
as
everywhere
to
try
to
get
list
from
different
people.
he
used
every
eighth
person
who
was
registered
and
erased
the
border
and
that
was
--
there
were
40,000
voters
of
which
there
30
to
4,000
white
and
6,500
negro.
now
you
have
to
consider
that
there
were
--
that
is
a
parish
that
has
very
few
negroes,
comparatively
speaking,
only
20%
or
21%
negro
there.
so
they
used
every
eighth
person
registered.
he
took
every
eighth
name
and
also
they
went
through
the
city
directory
which
has
every
name
of
every
person
in
the
city
of
lafayette
which
comprises
most
of
the
population
of
the
parish
and
the
phone
directory
which
included
all
of
the
phones
in
the
entire
parish
as
well
as
list
submitted
by
the
school
board
and
also
a
bunch
of
list
submitted
by
other
people
and
also
by
the
commission.
there
was
no
record.
they
did
not
ask
--
they
asked
the
question,
but
he
did
not
insist
on
as
to
how
many
questionnaires
were
returned.
so
we
do
not
know
how
many
questionnaires
were
returned
out
of
11,000,
but
the
clerk
found
by
looking
at
it
and
making
the
determination
as
to
whether
they
were
qualified
not
to
serve
and
he
used
the
requirements
of
the
law
of
the
state,
21
years
old,
reads,
speak,
and
write
the
english
language.
many
people
out
there
do
not
speak
the
english
language,
they
speak
french,
both
white
and
negro,
many
people,
many
or
whites
and
many
negroes
speak
only
french
there
in
this
section
of
the
state
and
they
are
not
qualified
unless
they
can
read
and
right
and
speak
the
english
language.
many
times
we
conduct
a
trial
completely
in
french
out
there.
now,
this
must
now
also
be
on
the
interdiction
of
mental
or
physical
infirmity
and
not
be
interdicted.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
we
speak,
we
conduct
the
trial
in
french
only
where
it
is
a
misdemeanor
and
the
judge
speaks
french,
the
district
attorney
speaks
french,
the
lawyers
on
both
sides
speak
french
and
the
witnesses
also
speak
french.
so
only
to
those
cases.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
no
jury
trials
in
french.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
we
feel
that
sometimes
misdemeanors
are
easier
to
try
that
way
because
it
takes
a
whole
lot
longer
to
have
an
interpreter
and
they
had
to
be
a
resident
of
the
parish
for
a
year.
so
he
stick
to
these
out
after
receiving
all
these
questionnaires
and
he
found
as
far
as
qualification
was
good
and
placed
on
a
card
index,
he
had
6,354
white
and
1,015
negroes
which
he
says
in
his
brief
comprised
of
13
--
a
level
with
13%
of
the
population,
14%
either
13.76
and
i
will
say
the
same
thing
but
i
must
--
i
did
not
put
in
there,
in
my
brief,
that
it
was
--
it
was
over
21%
of
the
entire
male
negro
population.
so
there
were
1,015
negroes
who
were
in
the
box
who
were
qualified
according
to
the
clerk
and
used
that
box
and
it
is
in
the
record
on
page
15
of
the
record,
appendix
and
so
that
means
that
were
over
21%
of
the
negro
male
population
considered
for
jury
service
as
eligible
by
the
clerk
and
by
the
commission.
so
there
were
actually
more
negroes
who
were
considered
for
jury
service
than
there
were
actually
percentage
of
the
community.
now,
he
put
them
in
there.
after
he
did
that
and
he
had
these
names,
he
has
a
--
you
have
to
see
in
the
–
believe
all
the
court
he
has
to
fill
up
this
whole
table,
thousands
and
thousands
of
cards
and
he
has
added
onto
it
since
that
time,
but
he
took
out
400,
100
were
necessary
and
he
put
it
in
the
grand
jury
venire
of
which
he
had
373
whites
and
27
negroes
which
amounted
to
6.75
of
the
population
as
what
he
figured
of
the
population
and
there
was
one
name
drawn
out
of
it.
now
the
grand
jury,
when
they
draw
up
the
grand
jury
venire,
you
have
to
understand
that
it
is
drawn
by
lots
so
they
dipped
in
there
and
got
20
names
for
the
grand
jury
venire
of
which
19
were
white
and
1
negro.
but
it
could
very
well
have
been
just
the
opposite.
it
could
have
been
--
quite
a
few
because
since
that
time,
unlike
this
year,
this
grand
jury
--
this
grand
jury,
we
had
no
negroes
on
it,
but
in
one
instance
in
the
spring
we
had
three
on
the
grand
jury,
but
it
varies.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
yes,
yes
your
honor.
he
did
--
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
your
honor,
if
your
honor
please,
the
clerk
said
that
he
wanted
--
they
do
not
add
because
of
identification
purposes,
he
said
that
on
page
51
and
he
needed
that
for
identification
purposes.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
no,
your
honor.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
no,
your
honor,
he
asked
raised
and
i
thought
also
that
he
should
have
done
it
because
i
thought
that
in
case,
if
the
case
would
be
appealed
and
brought
to
this
court
and
we
would
have
no
problem
in
determining
how
many
negroes
and
whites
were
there
because
if
we
did
not
have
it
on
there
we
would
be
in
a
quandary
here
as
to
how
many
negroes
and
whites
we
had
no
there
and
i
wanted
to
be
sure
that
this
court
understood
that
there
was
more
than
the
percentage
negroes
in
the
parish
--
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
--
who
were
considered.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
sir?
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
that
is
just
the
way
it
falls,
your
honor.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
it
does
not
mean
that
every
year
is
the
same
thing
or
every
term
is
the
same
thing.
it
just
happened
in
that
case
and
i
do
not
believe
that
this
court
would
mold
a
hole
just
because
one
case
that
there
was
no
negroes
on
the
jury.
the
only
way
we
can
come
back
at
that
your
honor,
is
to
arbitrarily
--
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
yes.
but
the
whitus
case
was
a
little
different
than
that.
they
had
been
consistent
--
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
they
were
considered
over
the
period
of
time
that
they
had
certain
so
call
of
cause
for
negroes
and
certain
call
of
cause
for
whites
and
this
is
not
the
situation
here.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
that
is
correct.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
and
how
would
we
ever
find
out
how
many
negroes
were
on
the
jury
if
we
had
not
put
them
on
there
--
put
down
the
race,
we
would
never
be
able
to
tell
this
court
how
many
were
on
and
how
many
were
not
on.
i
say
your
honor
that
the
only
way
we
can
--
would
be
that
--
to
comply
with
the
--
having
a
specific
number
of
negroes
on
the
grand
jury
would
be
to
arbitrarily
put
21%
negroes
on
the
grand
jury.
that
would
be
the
one
way
i
can
see
you
could
arbitrarily
do
that.
i
do
not
think
this
court
would
want
us
to
arbitrarily
place
exactly
the
same
number
of
negroes
on
the
grand
jury
as
they
are
in
the
community
because
that
is
not
what
was
said
in
the
case
of
swain
versus
alabama
where
they
said,
we
learned
neither
the
jury
rules
nor
the
venire
need
be
a
perfect
mirror
of
the
community
or
accurately
reflect
the
proportionate
strength
of
every
identifiable
group.
we
learned
from
this,
that
the
jurors
will
be
selected
as
men
not
as
a
race
and
that
is
what
we
are
doing
your
honor.
we
are
not
selecting
jurors
according
to
race.
we
are
selecting
jurors
according
to
men
and
that
is
what
we
have
been
doing
all
the
time.
and
that
is
what
we
continue
to
do
unless
this
court
will
tell
us
different.
if
this
court
tells
us
that
we
have
to
select
by
proportion,
we
will
do
it,
but
so
far
we
have
followed
avery
versus
georgia
--
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
then
we
would
take
it
off.
we
have
--
try
to
follow
whatever
this
court
says
to
do,
but
avery
versus
georgia
says
that
we
have
got
to
utilize
this.
in
fact,
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
--
when
scott
versus
walker
was
decided
and
davis
versus
davis
which
is
a
fifth
circuit
case
and
also
scott
versus
walker,
that
was
the
time
that
he
thought
of
this
system
and
under
my
direction
as
a
matter
of
fact
as
soon
as
scott
versus
walker
was
decided,
i
wrote
and
i
wrote
letters
to
all
of
these
clerks
of
the
courts
and
told
them
they
have
got
to
comply
with
this
scott
versus
walker
and
there
is
a
conscientious
duty
on
the
local
officials
to
develop
a
system
of
jury
systems
that
would
result
in
a
factor
of
sex
in
the
community
and
that
they
should
be
placed
on
a
master
list
of
these
uses
of
source
from
which
to
select
the
grand
and
petit
jurors
and
there
should
be
no
discrimination
of
any
kind
between
any
classes.
and
he
did
so
at
my
request
and
he
has
got
in
the
record
that
he
–
well,
i
worked
with
him
to
try
to
get
this
system
in
effect
there
that
and
of
course
akins,
your
honor,
akins
versus
texas
is
the
same
thing.
they
say
defendants
on
our
system
of
criminal
statutes
are
not
entitled
to
demand
representatives
of
their
racial
inheritance
upon
jurors
before
whom
they
are
tried.
they
are
simply
entitled
to
a
fair
section
of
the
community
and
there
has
been
no
evidence
to
show
that
the
clerk
of
court
was
in
bad
faith.
they
had
a
chance
to
cross
examine
him.
they
cross
examined
him.
they
questioned
him
for
a
long
time
and
they
did
not
bring
out
anything
to
show
that
he
was
prejudiced
in
any
way.
that
he
tried
to
get
more
negroes
than
whites
or
whites
more
negroes
that
he
tried
to
select
them
in
accordance
with
whether
they
were
qualified
or
not
qualified.
i
would
like
to
pass
if
your
honor
please
to
the
next
question
which
is
the
women
on
the
jury.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
they
are
claiming
that
women
were
systematically
excluded
from
grand
jury
which
is
not
true.
we
give
them
an
exemption,
but
we
do
not
exclude
women
from
the
grand
jury
or
from
any
jury.
they
are
--
there
were
18
states
as
a
matter
of
fact
now
grant
women
and
not
include
exemption
the
same
as
louisiana
and
they
fall
on
great
portion
of
this
--
over
the
population
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
are
presently
i
think
21
million
women
in
the
united
states
who
have
children
and
the
only
difference
between
versus
me
as
a
lawyer
and
you,
your
honors
as
a
judge
in
louisiana
is
that
we
both
exempt
it,
well
i
exempted
as
a
lawyer,
you
are
exempted
as
a
judge
and
women
are
exempted
because
they
are
women
and
there
were
school
teachers
who
were
exempted,
school
bus
drivers,
pharmacists,
ministers,
lawyers,
dentists,
fireman,
but
the
only
difference,
and
they
are
not
excluded,
they
are
not
excluded
as
a
difference,
they
are
not
excluded,
they
are
just
exempted.
the
only
difference
between
us
for
instance,
you
as
a
judge
and
me
as
a
lawyer
is
that
we
must
claim
our
exemption
and
in
order
for
them
to
be
--
they
have
to
waive
their
exemptions,
but
we
must
claim
ours.
there
is
no
difference
at
all
between
the
treatment
of
a
lawyer
or
a
woman
insofar
as
exemption
is
concerned.
it
is
just
a
matter
of
procedure.
if
we
want
to
be
exempted
as
a
lawyer,
we
must
claim
it
also
as
a
judge,
a
school
teacher
or
bus
driver,
but
the
purpose
is
to
save
the
women
a
trip
to
the
courthouse
to
claim
their
exemption
and
that
is
the
only
difference,
but
we
have
certainly
tried
to
get
the
women
interested
in
serving
on
the
grand
jury.
in
louisiana
there
are
one
million
three
hundred
--
over
one
million
women
who
are
married,
over
one
million,
i
mean
population
–
women,
there
are
over
1
million
women
in
the
state
and
they
all
--
69%
are
married
and
as
your
grand
jury
pays
$12.00
a
day,
petit
jury
pays
$8.00
a
day
for
a
woman
has
to
get
a
babysitter,
it
is
going
to
cost
a
whole
lot
more
than
that
to
try
to
get
a
babysitter
even
to
serve
on
a
grand
jury.
if
we
could
take
testimony
of
my
associate
here
he
can
tell
you
how
much
it
cost
him
to
get
babysitters
for
his
wife
to
come
over
here
to
hear
the
case
today.
of
course,
i
have
my
own
babysitters.
we
have
some
old
children
who
baby
sit
for
our
younger
ones.
but
they
are
--
i
think
that
complaint
of
course
is
not
that
the
white
was
unconstitutional.
they
are
not
complaining
about
the
unconstitutionality
of
white.
they
are
complaining
as
i
understand
it
is
that
the
way
we
apply
in
louisiana,
that
we
have
not
encouraged
any
women
to
serve
and
that
in
florida
they
did
have
some,
in
louisiana
there
was
none.
i
do
not
believe
that
they
would
want
a
--
have
a
woman
on
the
jury
be
good
because
the
last
time
they
put
one
on
out
there,
they
made
her
the
foreman
of
the
jury
and
they
convicted
the
accused.
in
fact
that
was
a
rape
case,
but
i
do
not
think
they
will
try
it
again.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
yes
it
could
have
been,
if
you
would
add
a
woman
he
could
have
been
thrown
to
the
electric
chair
and
probably
would
because
he
was
part
of
the
act
--
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
that
is
right,
really
one
--
remarkable
if
i
won
one
your
honor.
i
can
testify
to
that,
but
i
would
like
to
also
now
pass
to
our
last
point
your
honor.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
yes.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
is
that
one
now?
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
in
--
not
in
my
parish.
there
has
been
one
in
my
other
--
when
--
well,
i
have
three
parishes,
in
acadia
parish
is
the
parish
i
am
telling
you
about
where
they
have
had
a
woman
on
the
grand
jury,
made
the
foreman
and
convicted
the
accused
of
rape.
but
--
in
the
rape
case.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
she
was
on
the
petty
jury,
she
was
on
the
petty
jury,
yes.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
but
we
have
many
--
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
yes.
we
have
in
acadia
parish.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
yes.
now
we
have
--
venire
percentages
in
all
three
parish
are
women,
which
we
did
not
have
before
--
we
had
--
we
have
a
new
courthouse
--
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
no
your
honor.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
yes.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
this
is
lafayette.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
yes.
but
they
have
not
--
they
have
not
made
our
request,
a
new
courthouse.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
no,
your
honor.
there
--
they
have
not
made
any
--
there
have
never
been
no
application
made
by
them
for
to
waive
their
exemption.
i
notice
that
there
are
--
under
the
--
in
hoyt
case
that
they
--
the
court
said
that
the
way
these
states
included
the
district
of
columbia
that
time
in
61
where
a
woman
had
a
absolute
exemption
based
upon
sex,
exercisable
in
one
form
or
another
and
the
--
and
that
in
age
stage
they
were
exempted
if
they
had
been
a
responsibilities
which
would
cause
a
new
hardship
and
i
would
like
to
think
of
myself
as
the
representative
of
this
--
by
the
way
there
is
a
--
there
is
this
brief.
it
was
filed
by
certain
bar
on
this
whole
question,
but
he
spent
–
he
got
a
40
page
brief
and
he
spent
all
but
the
eighth
over
the
last
four
pages
in
giving
the
history
of
women’s
right
which
i
agree
with.
it
is
a
very
well
written
brief
about
women’s
rights
and
i
really
agree
with
all
he
said
except
the
last
two
pages
where
he
talked
about
this
particular
case
and
he
represents
a
180
million
or
180,000
women
who
belongs
to
this
organization
of
which
my
assistant
happens
to
be
a
member.
i
would
like
to
think
of
myself
representing
21
million
women
that
are
at
a
liberty
to
make
their
own
choice
as
to
whether
they
should
serve
or
not.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
yes
your
honor.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
well,
because
--
you
see
in
the
--
in
this
--
in
the
hoyt
case
it
was
stated
that
they
talk
about
the
exclusion
of
the
jury
--
the
inclusion
on
the
jury
list
of
persons
so
exempted,
usually
serves
as
a
waste
of
time
to
the
court
and
in
the
hoyt
case
is
what
this
court
said.
so,
they
were
grant
--
they
were
--
did
not
call
them
if
they
were
exempted.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
that
is
right.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
that
is
right.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
what
--
you
see
your
honor,
if
we
did
that
and
who
would
we
mail
--(voice
overlap)
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
well,
that
--
maybe
i
will
be
in
and
if
your
honors
please
--
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
i
will
--
well,
i
will
take
your
honor's
suggestion
and
i
will
--
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
no
it
will
not,
but
--
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
i
know
but
i
do
not
feel
as
though
that
was
in
itself
the
fact
that
i
--
the
clerk
of
court
had
no
responsibility.
i
do
not
feel
that
the
clerk
of
court
had
any
responsibility
to
determine
himself
whether
or
not
the
women
of
the
parish
wanted
to
serve.
he
did
take
means,
he
asked
my
assistant
to
go
out
and
talk
to
these
women
and
asked
them
to
get
themselves
interested
in
this
and
they
did
not.
but
he
did
not
feel
as
though
he
should
send
questionnaires
out
to
them.
as
a
matter
of
fact
one
of
the
ladies
your
honors
please,
one
of
the
ladies
did
sent
one
in.
he
had
one
woman
who
had
wanted
to
serve.
and
i
would
like
to
draw
to
my
last
point
your
honor
which
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
accused
rights
were
prejudice
insofar
as
the
constitution
is
concerned
in
the
miranda
versus
arizona.
now,
understanding
this
particular
case,
your
honor,
insofar
as
the
miranda
was
concerned
we
did
not
use
the
statement
in
convicting
the
accused
and
presenting
our
side
of
the
case.
we
did
not
use
it
at
all
and
we
had
no
intention
because
we
were
able
to
prove
and
that
i
think
is
an
unusual
case
where
they
caught
the
accused
in
the
act
of
committing
the
rape
which
is
a
very
unusual
case.
so
it
was
not
necessary
to
use
the
confession.
so
we
did
not
use
it,
did
not
mention
it
at
all.
but
we
did
serve
on
the
accused
and
his
lawyer
before
the
trial
started
without
the
jury
knowing
about
it,
we
served
a
notice
that
we
would
introduce
the
confession,
you
see,
because
that
is
the
law
of
the
state.
if
you
intend
to
use
a
confession
you
have
to
give
a
notice
ahead
of
time
so
which
we
did.
but
when
we
presented
our
side
of
the
case
we
did
not
use
the
confession.
and
at
the
end
of
that
our
presentation
of
the
case,
when
the
defense
or
when
they
had
to
prove
their
side
they
came
on
and
they
have
put
him
on
the
stand.
so
as
soon
as
they
have
got
through
with
their
examination
of
chief
then
i
asked
the
court
to
withdraw
the
jury.
and
after
the
jury
was
withdrawn
and
i
advised
the
court
that
we
have
a
confession
which
we
intended
to
use
to
impeach
the
testimony
of
the
accused
and
so
while
they
were
out,
we
then
proceeded
to
show
the
voluntary
nature,
under
the
law
of
the
state
we
have
to
show
the
voluntary
nature
of
the
confession,
which
we
did.
we
showed
the
voluntary
nature
of
the
confession
as
well
as
the
compliance
with
miranda.
now,
their
complaint
is
that
miranda
was
complied
with
all
except
for
one
thing,
they
said
that
the
accused
were
not
told
that
he
was
entitled
to
an
attorney
at
the
time
that
the
statement
was
given.
so
that
was
what
we
--
we
did
inform
him,
he
was
informed,
he
was
informed
by
the
officer
or
which
one,
was
it
called
officer,
he
was
informed
of
all
of
the
rights
in
the
miranda
but
we
did
not
inform
him
your
honor
that
he
was
entitled
to
an
attorney
at
that
time
when
he
gave
the
statement.
so
that
is
what
their
complaint
is
now.
so
but
the
judge
thought
that
he
did
complied
with
miranda
because
they
said
he
was
told
you
are
entitled
to
an
attorney.
so
he
said
that
--
he
indicated
that
he
thought
that
when
he
said
you
are
entitled
to
an
attorney
the
guy
should
have
understood
at
that
time,
but
he
did
not
say
at
this
time.
he
did
not
use
the
word
at
this
time.
so
then
that
is
their
complaint,
but
i
am
saying
this
that
the
statement
was
voluntary,
was
shown
to
be
voluntary.
the
court
found
it
was
voluntary.
it
was
proven
to
be
voluntary
outside
the
presence
of
a
jury
then
again
in
the
presence
of
a
jury,
we
showed
it
was
voluntary.
we
did
prove
it,
it
was
voluntary.
it
was
reliable
and
there
was
no
coercion
of
any
kind
there.
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
was
drinking
coffee,
asked
the
fellow
if
he
would
like
to
have
some
coffee,
he
said
no,
i
do
not
want
to
drink
coffee,
offered
him,
i
think
some
cigarettes
and
some
phone
call
or
anything.
but
it
was
a
friendly
place
to
--
attitude
in
that
park
but
--
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
yes.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
well,
you
see
that
was
the
point,
that
is
why
if
--
when
he
took
the
stand
he
had
a
completely
different
story
and
so
he
told
his
story
to
the
jury
about
how
this
thing
happened.
that
he
was
going
out
to
burglarize
the
place
with
a
friend
of
his
and
that
while
they
were,
they
happen
to
stumble
on
this
girl
who
was
in
the
corvette
down
there,
so
we
might
(inaudible)
your
honor
and
when
he
got
down
there
that
was
when
the
officer
shone
the
lights
on
him
and
arrest
him
so,
that
was
his
story
why,
you
see.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
well,
then
i
–
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
then
i
asked
him,
okay,
then
i
went
back
and
cross
examined
if
he
--
and
i
said
now,
did
you
not,
you
say
this
is
the
way
it
happened.
now,
even
the
fact
that
you
had
a
conversation
with
the
officer
on
blank,
they
are
blank
and
did
you
not
tell
them
this.
no,
i
did
not
and
this
and
this,
no
i
did
not.
so
then
i
said,
now,
your
honor
please,
i
intend
to
impeach
this
man’s
testimony
by
the
testimony
of
officer
so
on,
so
on,
so
on,
so
on,
so
on
and
that
is
the
way
i
did
it.
and
then
we
put
the
officers
on
the
stand
but
did
not
introduce
the
confession.
we
just
put
the
officer
in
the
stand
and
--
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
testified
that
he
did
make
the
statement
that
he
denied
having
made.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
well,
in
a
way,
yes.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
but
it
was
used
to
impeach
his
testimony
alone.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
no
sir.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
we
--
i
thought
from
--
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
like
to
just,
excuse
me,
take
my
breathe.
although,
i
have
been
here
three
times,
of
course
--
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
i
have
been
here
three
times.
first
time
it
was
as
justice
douglas
remembers,
i
was
here
representing
an
accused
who
had
been
electrocuted
by
the
state,
cannot
be
electrocuted
by
the
state
once
and
they
were
trying
to
electrocute
him
the
second
time
and
i
was
here
to
plead
but
--
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
that
is
right,
your
honor.
we
were
not
successful,
but
we
had
you
on
our
side.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
yes.
very
good.
if
your
honors,
please,
i
would
like
to
start
off
with
the
first
point
and
there
are
three
points
involved
here,
the
first
one
being
that
they
are
all
complaining
that
there
was
a
systematic
exclusion
of
negroes
on
the
grand
jury,
the
second
being
systematic
exclusion
of
women
and
the
third
of
being
the
failure
to
comply
with
miranda.
so
i
would
like
to
begin
with
the
first
point
and
say
this
that
i
came
here
today
not
to
defend
the
commission
or
the
clerk
at
court
who
was
a
member,
but
to
praise
him
in
the
manner
in
which
he
selected
names
to
be
considered
for
the
grand
jury
as
well
as
the
petit
jury,
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
complaint
here
is
strictly
to
the
grand
jury.
he
is
not
complaining
that
there
was
a
--
that
the
trial
was
not
fair
or
that
there
was
anything
wrong
with
the
petit
jury,
but
simply
to
the
grand
jury.
the
clerk
of
court
began,
as
he
said
to
attempt
to
get
as
wide
the
range
of
persons
as
he
could
to
consider
for
a
grand
jury
and
petit
jury
service
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
he
sent
out
11,000
questionnaires
in
a
parish,
a
county
we
call
it
parish
here
in
louisiana,
but
where
there
was
40,000
population,
he
sent
out
11,000
questionnaires
according
to
his
testimony
which
is
in
the
record
here
and
incidentally
the
record
was
compiled
by
the
complainants
and
we
are
going
to
court
on
the
record
that
they
have
got,
they
have
complied
and
submitted.
but
there
were
11,000
questionnaires
mailed
out,
out
of
the
total
of
40,000
persons
in
the
parish
of
which
there
were
21,000
males.
he
sent
out
this
only
to
the
male
population.
although,
we
did
have
a
place
to
show
whether
they
were
male
or
female
because
the
clerk
did
attempt
and
it
is
shown
in
the
record
that
the
clerk
did
attempt
to
get
women
interested
in
jury
service.
as
the
record
will
show
that
he
talked
to
my
assistant
who
happens
to
be
a
lady,
an
assistant
district
attorney
there
and
trying
to
get
her
to
talk
to
the
women’s
clubs
and
get
them
interested
in
that
and
the
reason,
he
said
in
the
records,
they
had
not
done
it
before
was
because
we
had
an
old
courthouse
which
has
no
facilities
to
help
to
--
for
women
jurors,
but
that
was
going
to
--
were
being
built
at
the
time
a
new
courthouse.
and
at
the
time
that
the
case
was
tried
we
tried
it
in
the
new
courthouse,
but
at
the
time
that
the
selection
was
made
we
were
in
the
temporary
courthouse
at
that
particular
time,
but
he
did
try
to
get
the
assistant
district
attorney
to
get
the
ladies
interested.
now,
to
go
over
this
there
were
21,000
males
in
the
parish
and
there
were
17,000
white
and
about
4,000
negroes
which
amounted
to
20%
negro
and
so
far
as
the
male
population
was
concerned.
then
he
has
the
registered
voters
here,
we
will
show
it
that
there
were
a
total
of
6,541
negroes
who
were
registered
out
of
the
total
population
of
9,000.
so
there
are
--
the
entire
--
the
population
of
this
parish
is
very
highly
registered
both
white
and
negro
because
out
of
the
9,400
negroes
in
the
parish
there
were
6,500
registered
voters
and
there
were
3,573
negro
males
in
the
parish
and
17,000
white
males
in
the
parish.
now,
he
sent
out
11,000
of
these
questionnaires
and
he
went
around
looking
as
everywhere
to
try
to
get
list
from
different
people.
he
used
every
eighth
person
who
was
registered
and
erased
the
border
and
that
was
--
there
were
40,000
voters
of
which
there
30
to
4,000
white
and
6,500
negro.
now
you
have
to
consider
that
there
were
--
that
is
a
parish
that
has
very
few
negroes,
comparatively
speaking,
only
20%
or
21%
negro
there.
so
they
used
every
eighth
person
registered.
he
took
every
eighth
name
and
also
they
went
through
the
city
directory
which
has
every
name
of
every
person
in
the
city
of
lafayette
which
comprises
most
of
the
population
of
the
parish
and
the
phone
directory
which
included
all
of
the
phones
in
the
entire
parish
as
well
as
list
submitted
by
the
school
board
and
also
a
bunch
of
list
submitted
by
other
people
and
also
by
the
commission.
there
was
no
record.
they
did
not
ask
--
they
asked
the
question,
but
he
did
not
insist
on
as
to
how
many
questionnaires
were
returned.
so
we
do
not
know
how
many
questionnaires
were
returned
out
of
11,000,
but
the
clerk
found
by
looking
at
it
and
making
the
determination
as
to
whether
they
were
qualified
not
to
serve
and
he
used
the
requirements
of
the
law
of
the
state,
21
years
old,
reads,
speak,
and
write
the
english
language.
many
people
out
there
do
not
speak
the
english
language,
they
speak
french,
both
white
and
negro,
many
people,
many
or
whites
and
many
negroes
speak
only
french
there
in
this
section
of
the
state
and
they
are
not
qualified
unless
they
can
read
and
right
and
speak
the
english
language.
many
times
we
conduct
a
trial
completely
in
french
out
there.
now,
this
must
now
also
be
on
the
interdiction
of
mental
or
physical
infirmity
and
not
be
interdicted.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
we
speak,
we
conduct
the
trial
in
french
only
where
it
is
a
misdemeanor
and
the
judge
speaks
french,
the
district
attorney
speaks
french,
the
lawyers
on
both
sides
speak
french
and
the
witnesses
also
speak
french.
so
only
to
those
cases.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
no
jury
trials
in
french.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
we
feel
that
sometimes
misdemeanors
are
easier
to
try
that
way
because
it
takes
a
whole
lot
longer
to
have
an
interpreter
and
they
had
to
be
a
resident
of
the
parish
for
a
year.
so
he
stick
to
these
out
after
receiving
all
these
questionnaires
and
he
found
as
far
as
qualification
was
good
and
placed
on
a
card
index,
he
had
6,354
white
and
1,015
negroes
which
he
says
in
his
brief
comprised
of
13
--
a
level
with
13%
of
the
population,
14%
either
13.76
and
i
will
say
the
same
thing
but
i
must
--
i
did
not
put
in
there,
in
my
brief,
that
it
was
--
it
was
over
21%
of
the
entire
male
negro
population.
so
there
were
1,015
negroes
who
were
in
the
box
who
were
qualified
according
to
the
clerk
and
used
that
box
and
it
is
in
the
record
on
page
15
of
the
record,
appendix
and
so
that
means
that
were
over
21%
of
the
negro
male
population
considered
for
jury
service
as
eligible
by
the
clerk
and
by
the
commission.
so
there
were
actually
more
negroes
who
were
considered
for
jury
service
than
there
were
actually
percentage
of
the
community.
now,
he
put
them
in
there.
after
he
did
that
and
he
had
these
names,
he
has
a
--
you
have
to
see
in
the
–
believe
all
the
court
he
has
to
fill
up
this
whole
table,
thousands
and
thousands
of
cards
and
he
has
added
onto
it
since
that
time,
but
he
took
out
400,
100
were
necessary
and
he
put
it
in
the
grand
jury
venire
of
which
he
had
373
whites
and
27
negroes
which
amounted
to
6.75
of
the
population
as
what
he
figured
of
the
population
and
there
was
one
name
drawn
out
of
it.
now
the
grand
jury,
when
they
draw
up
the
grand
jury
venire,
you
have
to
understand
that
it
is
drawn
by
lots
so
they
dipped
in
there
and
got
20
names
for
the
grand
jury
venire
of
which
19
were
white
and
1
negro.
but
it
could
very
well
have
been
just
the
opposite.
it
could
have
been
--
quite
a
few
because
since
that
time,
unlike
this
year,
this
grand
jury
--
this
grand
jury,
we
had
no
negroes
on
it,
but
in
one
instance
in
the
spring
we
had
three
on
the
grand
jury,
but
it
varies.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
yes,
yes
your
honor.
he
did
--
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
your
honor,
if
your
honor
please,
the
clerk
said
that
he
wanted
--
they
do
not
add
because
of
identification
purposes,
he
said
that
on
page
51
and
he
needed
that
for
identification
purposes.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
no,
your
honor.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
no,
your
honor,
he
asked
raised
and
i
thought
also
that
he
should
have
done
it
because
i
thought
that
in
case,
if
the
case
would
be
appealed
and
brought
to
this
court
and
we
would
have
no
problem
in
determining
how
many
negroes
and
whites
were
there
because
if
we
did
not
have
it
on
there
we
would
be
in
a
quandary
here
as
to
how
many
negroes
and
whites
we
had
no
there
and
i
wanted
to
be
sure
that
this
court
understood
that
there
was
more
than
the
percentage
negroes
in
the
parish
--
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
--
who
were
considered.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
sir?
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
that
is
just
the
way
it
falls,
your
honor.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
it
does
not
mean
that
every
year
is
the
same
thing
or
every
term
is
the
same
thing.
it
just
happened
in
that
case
and
i
do
not
believe
that
this
court
would
mold
a
hole
just
because
one
case
that
there
was
no
negroes
on
the
jury.
the
only
way
we
can
come
back
at
that
your
honor,
is
to
arbitrarily
--
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
yes.
but
the
whitus
case
was
a
little
different
than
that.
they
had
been
consistent
--
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
they
were
considered
over
the
period
of
time
that
they
had
certain
so
call
of
cause
for
negroes
and
certain
call
of
cause
for
whites
and
this
is
not
the
situation
here.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
that
is
correct.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
and
how
would
we
ever
find
out
how
many
negroes
were
on
the
jury
if
we
had
not
put
them
on
there
--
put
down
the
race,
we
would
never
be
able
to
tell
this
court
how
many
were
on
and
how
many
were
not
on.
i
say
your
honor
that
the
only
way
we
can
--
would
be
that
--
to
comply
with
the
--
having
a
specific
number
of
negroes
on
the
grand
jury
would
be
to
arbitrarily
put
21%
negroes
on
the
grand
jury.
that
would
be
the
one
way
i
can
see
you
could
arbitrarily
do
that.
i
do
not
think
this
court
would
want
us
to
arbitrarily
place
exactly
the
same
number
of
negroes
on
the
grand
jury
as
they
are
in
the
community
because
that
is
not
what
was
said
in
the
case
of
swain
versus
alabama
where
they
said,
we
learned
neither
the
jury
rules
nor
the
venire
need
be
a
perfect
mirror
of
the
community
or
accurately
reflect
the
proportionate
strength
of
every
identifiable
group.
we
learned
from
this,
that
the
jurors
will
be
selected
as
men
not
as
a
race
and
that
is
what
we
are
doing
your
honor.
we
are
not
selecting
jurors
according
to
race.
we
are
selecting
jurors
according
to
men
and
that
is
what
we
have
been
doing
all
the
time.
and
that
is
what
we
continue
to
do
unless
this
court
will
tell
us
different.
if
this
court
tells
us
that
we
have
to
select
by
proportion,
we
will
do
it,
but
so
far
we
have
followed
avery
versus
georgia
--
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
then
we
would
take
it
off.
we
have
--
try
to
follow
whatever
this
court
says
to
do,
but
avery
versus
georgia
says
that
we
have
got
to
utilize
this.
in
fact,
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
--
when
scott
versus
walker
was
decided
and
davis
versus
davis
which
is
a
fifth
circuit
case
and
also
scott
versus
walker,
that
was
the
time
that
he
thought
of
this
system
and
under
my
direction
as
a
matter
of
fact
as
soon
as
scott
versus
walker
was
decided,
i
wrote
and
i
wrote
letters
to
all
of
these
clerks
of
the
courts
and
told
them
they
have
got
to
comply
with
this
scott
versus
walker
and
there
is
a
conscientious
duty
on
the
local
officials
to
develop
a
system
of
jury
systems
that
would
result
in
a
factor
of
sex
in
the
community
and
that
they
should
be
placed
on
a
master
list
of
these
uses
of
source
from
which
to
select
the
grand
and
petit
jurors
and
there
should
be
no
discrimination
of
any
kind
between
any
classes.
and
he
did
so
at
my
request
and
he
has
got
in
the
record
that
he
–
well,
i
worked
with
him
to
try
to
get
this
system
in
effect
there
that
and
of
course
akins,
your
honor,
akins
versus
texas
is
the
same
thing.
they
say
defendants
on
our
system
of
criminal
statutes
are
not
entitled
to
demand
representatives
of
their
racial
inheritance
upon
jurors
before
whom
they
are
tried.
they
are
simply
entitled
to
a
fair
section
of
the
community
and
there
has
been
no
evidence
to
show
that
the
clerk
of
court
was
in
bad
faith.
they
had
a
chance
to
cross
examine
him.
they
cross
examined
him.
they
questioned
him
for
a
long
time
and
they
did
not
bring
out
anything
to
show
that
he
was
prejudiced
in
any
way.
that
he
tried
to
get
more
negroes
than
whites
or
whites
more
negroes
that
he
tried
to
select
them
in
accordance
with
whether
they
were
qualified
or
not
qualified.
i
would
like
to
pass
if
your
honor
please
to
the
next
question
which
is
the
women
on
the
jury.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
they
are
claiming
that
women
were
systematically
excluded
from
grand
jury
which
is
not
true.
we
give
them
an
exemption,
but
we
do
not
exclude
women
from
the
grand
jury
or
from
any
jury.
they
are
--
there
were
18
states
as
a
matter
of
fact
now
grant
women
and
not
include
exemption
the
same
as
louisiana
and
they
fall
on
great
portion
of
this
--
over
the
population
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
are
presently
i
think
21
million
women
in
the
united
states
who
have
children
and
the
only
difference
between
versus
me
as
a
lawyer
and
you,
your
honors
as
a
judge
in
louisiana
is
that
we
both
exempt
it,
well
i
exempted
as
a
lawyer,
you
are
exempted
as
a
judge
and
women
are
exempted
because
they
are
women
and
there
were
school
teachers
who
were
exempted,
school
bus
drivers,
pharmacists,
ministers,
lawyers,
dentists,
fireman,
but
the
only
difference,
and
they
are
not
excluded,
they
are
not
excluded
as
a
difference,
they
are
not
excluded,
they
are
just
exempted.
the
only
difference
between
us
for
instance,
you
as
a
judge
and
me
as
a
lawyer
is
that
we
must
claim
our
exemption
and
in
order
for
them
to
be
--
they
have
to
waive
their
exemptions,
but
we
must
claim
ours.
there
is
no
difference
at
all
between
the
treatment
of
a
lawyer
or
a
woman
insofar
as
exemption
is
concerned.
it
is
just
a
matter
of
procedure.
if
we
want
to
be
exempted
as
a
lawyer,
we
must
claim
it
also
as
a
judge,
a
school
teacher
or
bus
driver,
but
the
purpose
is
to
save
the
women
a
trip
to
the
courthouse
to
claim
their
exemption
and
that
is
the
only
difference,
but
we
have
certainly
tried
to
get
the
women
interested
in
serving
on
the
grand
jury.
in
louisiana
there
are
one
million
three
hundred
--
over
one
million
women
who
are
married,
over
one
million,
i
mean
population
–
women,
there
are
over
1
million
women
in
the
state
and
they
all
--
69%
are
married
and
as
your
grand
jury
pays
$12.00
a
day,
petit
jury
pays
$8.00
a
day
for
a
woman
has
to
get
a
babysitter,
it
is
going
to
cost
a
whole
lot
more
than
that
to
try
to
get
a
babysitter
even
to
serve
on
a
grand
jury.
if
we
could
take
testimony
of
my
associate
here
he
can
tell
you
how
much
it
cost
him
to
get
babysitters
for
his
wife
to
come
over
here
to
hear
the
case
today.
of
course,
i
have
my
own
babysitters.
we
have
some
old
children
who
baby
sit
for
our
younger
ones.
but
they
are
--
i
think
that
complaint
of
course
is
not
that
the
white
was
unconstitutional.
they
are
not
complaining
about
the
unconstitutionality
of
white.
they
are
complaining
as
i
understand
it
is
that
the
way
we
apply
in
louisiana,
that
we
have
not
encouraged
any
women
to
serve
and
that
in
florida
they
did
have
some,
in
louisiana
there
was
none.
i
do
not
believe
that
they
would
want
a
--
have
a
woman
on
the
jury
be
good
because
the
last
time
they
put
one
on
out
there,
they
made
her
the
foreman
of
the
jury
and
they
convicted
the
accused.
in
fact
that
was
a
rape
case,
but
i
do
not
think
they
will
try
it
again.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
yes
it
could
have
been,
if
you
would
add
a
woman
he
could
have
been
thrown
to
the
electric
chair
and
probably
would
because
he
was
part
of
the
act
--
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
that
is
right,
really
one
--
remarkable
if
i
won
one
your
honor.
i
can
testify
to
that,
but
i
would
like
to
also

our
last
point
your
honor.

bertrand
deblanc
yes.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc

that
one
now?
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
in
--
not
in
my
parish.
there
has
been
one
in
my
other
--
when
--
well,
i
have
three
parishes,
in
acadia
parish
is
the
parish
i
am
telling
you
about
where
they
have
had
a
woman
on
the
grand
jury,
made
the
foreman
and
convicted
the
accused
of
rape.
but
--
in
the
rape
case.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
she
was
on
the
petty
jury,
she
was
on
the
petty
jury,
yes.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
but
we
have
many
--
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
yes.
we
have
in
acadia
parish.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
yes.
now
we
have
--
venire
percentages
in
all
three
parish
are
women,
which
we
did
not
have
before
--
we
had
--
we
have
a
new
courthouse
--
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
no
your
honor.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
yes.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
this
is
lafayette.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
yes.
but
they
have
not
--
they
have
not
made
our
request,
a
new
courthouse.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
no,
your
honor.
there
--
they
have
not
made
any
--
there
have
never
been
no
application
made
by
them
for
to
waive
their
exemption.
i
notice
that
there
are
--
under
the
--
in
hoyt
case
that
they
--
the
court
said
that
the
way
these
states
included
the
district
of
columbia
that
time
in
61
where
a
woman
had
a
absolute
exemption
based
upon
sex,
exercisable
in
one
form
or
another
and
the
--
and
that
in
age
stage
they
were
exempted
if
they
had
been
a
responsibilities
which
would
cause
a
new
hardship
and
i
would
like
to
think
of
myself
as
the
representative
of
this
--
by
the
way
there
is
a
--
there
is
this
brief.
it
was
filed
by
certain
bar
on
this
whole
question,
but
he
spent
–
he
got
a
40
page
brief
and
he
spent
all
but
the
eighth
over
the
last
four
pages
in
giving
the
history
of
women’s
right
which
i
agree
with.
it
is
a
very
well
written
brief
about
women’s
rights
and
i
really
agree
with
all
he
said
except
the
last
two
pages
where
he
talked
about
this
particular
case
and
he
represents
a
180
million
or
180,000
women
who
belongs
to
this
organization
of
which
my
assistant
happens
to
be
a
member.
i
would
like
to
think
of
myself
representing
21
million
women
that
are
at
a
liberty
to
make
their
own
choice
as
to
whether
they
should
serve
or
not.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
yes
your
honor.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
well,
because
--
you
see
in
the
--
in
this
--
in
the
hoyt
case
it
was
stated
that
they
talk
about
the
exclusion
of
the
jury
--
the
inclusion
on
the
jury
list
of
persons
so
exempted,
usually
serves
as
a
waste
of
time
to
the
court
and
in
the
hoyt
case
is
what
this
court
said.
so,
they
were
grant
--
they
were
--
did
not
call
them
if
they
were
exempted.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
that
is
right.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
that
is
right.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
what
--
you
see
your
honor,
if
we
did
that
and
who
would
we
mail
--(voice
overlap)
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
well,
that
--
maybe
i
will
be
in
and
if
your
honors
please
--
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
i
will
--
well,
i
will
take
your
honor's
suggestion
and
i
will
--
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
no
it
will
not,
but
--
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
i
know
but
i
do
not
feel
as
though
that
was
in
itself
the
fact
that
i
--
the
clerk
of
court
had
no
responsibility.
i
do
not
feel
that
the
clerk
of
court
had
any
responsibility
to
determine
himself
whether
or
not
the
women
of
the
parish
wanted
to
serve.
he
did
take
means,
he
asked
my
assistant
to
go
out
and
talk
to
these
women
and
asked
them
to
get
themselves
interested
in
this
and
they
did
not.
but
he
did
not
feel
as
though
he
should
send
questionnaires
out
to
them.
as
a
matter
of
fact
one
of
the
ladies
your
honors
please,
one
of
the
ladies
did
sent
one
in.
he
had
one
woman
who
had
wanted
to
serve.
and
i
would
like
to
draw
to
my
last
point
your
honor
which
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
accused
rights
were
prejudice
insofar
as
the
constitution
is
concerned
in
the
miranda
versus
arizona.
now,
understanding
this
particular
case,
your
honor,
insofar
as
the
miranda
was
concerned
we
did
not
use
the
statement
in
convicting
the
accused
and
presenting
our
side
of
the
case.
we
did
not
use
it
at
all
and
we
had
no
intention
because
we
were
able
to
prove
and
that
i
think
is
an
unusual
case
where
they
caught
the
accused
in
the
act
of
committing
the
rape
which
is
a
very
unusual
case.
so
it
was
not
necessary
to
use
the
confession.
so
we
did
not
use
it,
did
not
mention
it
at
all.
but
we
did
serve
on
the
accused
and
his
lawyer
before
the
trial
started
without
the
jury
knowing
about
it,
we
served
a
notice
that
we
would
introduce
the
confession,
you
see,
because
that
is
the
law
of
the
state.
if
you
intend
to
use
a
confession
you
have
to
give
a
notice
ahead
of
time
so
which
we
did.
but
when
we
presented
our
side
of
the
case
we
did
not
use
the
confession.
and
at
the
end
of
that
our
presentation
of
the
case,
when
the
defense
or
when
they
had
to
prove
their
side
they
came
on
and
they
have
put
him
on
the
stand.
so
as
soon
as
they
have
got
through
with
their
examination
of
chief
then
i
asked
the
court
to
withdraw
the
jury.
and
after
the
jury
was
withdrawn
and
i
advised
the
court
that
we
have
a
confession
which
we
intended
to
use
to
impeach
the
testimony
of
the
accused
and
so
while
they
were
out,
we
then
proceeded
to
show
the
voluntary
nature,
under
the
law
of
the
state
we
have
to
show
the
voluntary
nature
of
the
confession,
which
we
did.
we
showed
the
voluntary
nature
of
the
confession
as
well
as
the
compliance
with
miranda.
now,
their
complaint
is
that
miranda
was
complied
with
all
except
for
one
thing,
they
said
that
the
accused
were
not
told
that
he
was
entitled
to
an
attorney
at
the
time
that
the
statement
was
given.
so
that
was
what
we
--
we
did
inform
him,
he
was
informed,
he
was
informed
by
the
officer
or
which
one,
was
it
called
officer,
he
was
informed
of
all
of
the
rights
in
the
miranda
but
we
did
not
inform
him
your
honor
that
he
was
entitled
to
an
attorney
at
that
time
when
he
gave
the
statement.
so
that
is
what
their
complaint
is
now.
so
but
the
judge
thought
that
he
did
complied
with
miranda
because
they
said
he
was
told
you
are
entitled
to
an
attorney.
so
he
said
that
--
he
indicated
that
he
thought
that
when
he
said
you
are
entitled
to
an
attorney
the
guy
should
have
understood
at
that
time,
but
he
did
not
say
at
this
time.
he
did
not
use
the
word
at
this
time.
so
then
that
is
their
complaint,
but
i
am
saying
this
that
the
statement
was
voluntary,
was
shown
to
be
voluntary.
the
court
found
it
was
voluntary.
it
was
proven
to
be
voluntary
outside
the
presence
of
a
jury
then
again
in
the
presence
of
a
jury,
we
showed
it
was
voluntary.
we
did
prove
it,
it
was
voluntary.
it
was
reliable
and
there
was
no
coercion
of
any
kind
there.
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
was
drinking
coffee,
asked
the
fellow
if
he
would
like
to
have
some
coffee,
he
said
no,
i
do
not
want
to
drink
coffee,
offered
him,
i
think
some
cigarettes
and
some
phone
call
or
anything.
but
it
was
a
friendly
place
to
--
attitude
in
that
park
but
--
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
yes.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
well,
you
see
that
was
the
point,
that
is
why
if
--
when
he
took
the
stand
he
had
a
completely
different
story
and
so
he
told
his
story
to
the
jury
about
how
this
thing
happened.
that
he
was
going
out
to
burglarize
the
place
with
a
friend
of
his
and
that
while
they
were,
they
happen
to
stumble
on
this
girl
who
was
in
the
corvette
down
there,
so
we
might
(inaudible)
your
honor
and
when
he
got
down
there
that
was
when
the
officer
shone
the
lights
on
him
and
arrest
him
so,
that
was
his
story
why,
you
see.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
well,
then
i
–
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
then
i
asked
him,
okay,
then
i
went
back
and
cross
examined
if
he
--
and
i
said
now,
did
you
not,
you
say
this
is
the
way
it
happened.
now,
even
the
fact
that
you
had
a
conversation
with
the
officer
on
blank,
they
are
blank
and
did
you
not
tell
them
this.
no,
i
did
not
and
this
and
this,
no
i
did
not.
so
then
i
said,
now,
your
honor
please,
i
intend
to
impeach
this
man’s
testimony
by
the
testimony
of
officer
so
on,
so
on,
so
on,
so
on,
so
on
and
that
is
the
way
i
did
it.
and
then
we
put
the
officers
on
the
stand
but
did
not
introduce
the
confession.
we
just
put
the
officer
in
the
stand
and
--
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
testified
that
he
did
make
the
statement
that
he
denied
having
made.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
well,
in
a
way,
yes.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
but
it
was
used
to
impeach
his
testimony
alone.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
no
sir.
mr.
bertrand
deblanc
we
--
i
thought
from
--
thank
you,
your
honor.
