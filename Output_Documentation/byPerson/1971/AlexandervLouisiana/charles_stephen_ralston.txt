mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
petitioner,
claude
(ph)
alexander
in
this
case
which
is
here
on
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
to
review
the
affirmance
of
petitioner’s
conviction
of
rape.
the
petitioner
is
a
black
male
who
was
convicted
in
lafayette
parish
in
louisiana
and
he
raised
in
the
state
courts
and
raises
here
three
constitutional
challenges
to
his
indictment
and
his
conviction.
first,
he
urges
that
members
of
his
race
were
unconstitutionally
excluded
from
the
jury
list
and
the
venire
from
which
the
grand
jury
that
indicted
him
was
selected.
secondly,
he
urges
that
the
total
exclusion
of
women
from
the
service
from
jury
list,
and
therefore,
from
service
on
juries
in
the
parish
also
denied
him
due
process
of
law
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
finally,
he
urges
that
the
use
at
his
trial
of
a
statement
which
was
taken
without
compliance
the
requirements
of
miranda
versus
arizona
denied
him
due
process
of
law.
with
regard
to
the
first
contention,
the
exclusion
of
blacks
from
jury,
we
urge
basically
that
petitioner
clearly
established
a
prima
facie
case
of
jury
discrimination
within
the
rule
of
the
series
of
cases
beginning
with
avery
versus
georgia
and
proceeding
to
whitus
versus
georgia
and
the
cases
that
followed
whitus
and
i
will
return
to
briefly
discuss
why
we
urge
that
there
is
a
clear
prima
facie
case.
therefore,
the
issue
really
in
this
case
is
whether
the
state
has
offered
a
satisfactory
rebuttal
to
that
prima
facie
case.
in
other
words,
has
the
state
given
a
constitutionally
satisfactory
explanation
to
a
situation
where
a
disproportion
of
black
representation
on
juries
has
been
shown
wherein
the
jury
selection
process
racial
designations
were
before
the
jury
commissioners
when
they
selected
the
persons
who
were
to
be
on
the
jury
list?
in
getting
to
why
a
clear
prima
facie
case
has
been
made
out,
briefly,
the
evidence
introduced
in
the
motion
to
quash
the
indictment
in
the
court
below
showed
that
there
is
a
significant
draw
up
in
the
proportion
of
blacks
on
the
rolls
or
on
the
group
of
persons
who
were
being
considered
for
jury
service
during
stages
in
the
jury
selection
process
when
the
commissioners
were
working
from
documents
on
which
there
appeared
racial
designation.
the
jury
commission
was
operating
under
louisiana
statute
which
required
that
jury
venires
from
at
least
300
persons
be
made
up.
in
this
particular
instance
in
lafayette
parish,
they
went
above
the
minimum
and
established
venires
of
400
persons.
the
louisiana
statute
did
not
set
out
the
procedure
by
which
these
400
persons
are
to
be
arrived
at.
they
do
set
out
qualifications
for
jurors
and
certain
exemptions,
which
are
mostly
exemptions
based
on
occupation
and
physical
disability.
jury
commissioners
worked
from
a
number
of
sources
of
names
as
a
starting
point
to
achieve
the
final
400.
the
main
source
was
voter
registration
list,
a
city
directory
which
covered
the
city
of
lafayette
itself,
telephone
directory
and
certain
other
lists
which
are
not
fully
specified.
initially
there
was
an
objection
raised
because
these
lists
or
at
least
certain
of
them,
the
voter
registration
list
and
the
telephone
directory
were
not
admittedly
fully
representative
of
the
black
community.
that
is
there
is
a
disproportion
of
black
representations
compared
to
the
black
--
to
the
white
disproportion
and
we
urge
that
this
is
one
basis
why
the
jury
selection
method
violated
the
constitution.
however,
when
these
lists
were
used,
the
jury
commissioners
mailed
out
to
prospective
jurors,
a
total
of
11,000
questionnaires
and
received
back
approximately
7,300.
now,
of
those
7,300,
13.67%
were
from
blacks,
and
this
is
in
a
population
--
this
is
black
males
over
21,
that
is,
this
is
in
a
population
where
black
males
over
21
represented
20.27%
of
the
population.
on
the
questionnaires
there
was
a
request
for
the
race
of
the
person
returning
the
questionnaire
and
this
was
filled
in
all,
but
189
of
the
questionnaires.
a
card
was
made
up,
which
also
had
a
racial
designation.
these
7,000
questionnaires
were
then
gone
through
--
through
process
of
--
the
commissioners
say
weeding
out
those
who
were
not
qualified
or
who
might
claim
exemptions
from
the
service
until
approximately
2,000
questionnaires
were
arrived
at.
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
as
to
the
racial
composition
of
that
2,000.
however,
the
2,000
were
then
put
on
a
table
and
from
those
2,000
were
selected
400,
a
white
set
of
paper
having
just
the
name
and
address
of
the
person,
each
of
the
400
persons
was
put
into
a
box
from
which
20-man
grand
jury
venires
would
be
drawn.
in
the
particular
instance
of
petitioner
of
those
20,
one
was
black
and
he
was
not
picked
when
the
final
12-man
venire
was
picked
or
selected
from
the
20.
now,
of
those
400
names
at
the
end
of
the
selection
process,
the
portion
of
blacks
was
down
to
approximately
6.75%
and
it
is
this
–-
this
proportion
together
with
the
fact
that
at
the
time
in
the
process
when
an
overall
population
of
more
than
13%
was
being
examined.
there
were
racial
designations
on
the
documents
used.
there
was
a
clear
opportunity
to
discriminate.
it
was
condemned
by
whitus
and
avery,
coupled
with
a
disproportionate
weeding
out
of
blacks
as
opposed
to
whites
and
it
is
--
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
your
honor,
i
am
just
saying
myself
to
the
stage
when
they
have
the
7,300
questionnaires.
they
went
through
and
disposed
of
those
who
they
see
were
not
qualified.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
that
was
13.76%
black.
now,
when
they
went
up
to
400,
they
were
down
to
6.75%
black.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
that
is
out
of
20%
plus.
the
thing
that
is
not
clear
is
that
when
they
had
weeded
out
the
7,000
down
to
the
2,000
questionnaires
from
which
the
ultimate
400
were
selected,
what
was
the
racial
proportions
of
the
2,000
and
we
pointed
out
that
whichever
way,
whatever
--
whichever
happened,
whether
the
13%
were
reduced
down
to
6%
when
the
weeding
out
process
occurred
or
whether
it
went
from
13%
to
6%
when
the
final
400
were
drawn,
either
way
a
prima
facie
case
has
been
made
out
because
in
both
times
there
were
racial
designations
available
to
the
commissioners
to
use
during
this
--
during
the
process.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
your
honor,
we
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
we
have
urged
that
the
entire
process
has
to
be
looked
at,
that
whether
--
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
i
think
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
that
a
serious
constitutional
question
arises
just
from
that
shrinkage
because
the
jury
commissioners
admitted
that
the
sources,
at
least
two
of
the
sources,
the
voter
registration
rules
and
the
telephone
book
underrepresented
the
black
population.
so
that
they
knew
they
were
getting
a
greater
response
from
whites
and
the
court
has
indicated
that
for
sometime
that
where
--
that
there
is
a
duty
on
the
jury
commissioners
not
to
use
methods
that
they
know
are
going
to
result
in
a
underrepresentation
so
that
there
is
not
a
reasonable
cross-section
of
the
community.
we
do
not
rely
on
that
solely,
but
we
do
urge
the
entire
process
has
to
be
looked
at
because
the
ultimate
end
of
this
process
was
a
drop
from
20%
down
to
6.75%.
now,
we
again
feel
that
the
use
of
these
questionnaires
with
racial
designations
on
the
drop
of
proportion
brings
this
case
directly
under
avery
and
whitus
and
the
issue
is
essentially
whether
the
state
has
sufficiently
rebutted
this
prima
facie
case.
in
words
of
whitus,
has
the
state
offered
any
testimony
that
the
percentage
of
negroes
on
the
tax
digest
were
not
fully
qualified.
here
we
are
dealing
with
the
percentage
of
blacks
responding
to
the
questionnaires.
has
a
state
given
any
objective
evidence
that
the
proportion
of
blacks
qualified,
who
responded
to
these
questionnaires
was
not
as
fully
qualified
as
the
whites
who
responded
to
the
questionnaires
and
essentially
again
we
say
they
have
not.
they
testified
of
course
that
they
do
not
take
race
into
consideration
in
making
their
selections,
but
this
court
has
held
in
numerous
instances
that
such
protestations
are
not
sufficient
to
rebut
a
prima
facie
case.
they
say
that
they
apply
these
various
objective
criteria
that
are
on
the
face
of
the
questionnaire.
this,
however,
conflicts
with
the
presence
of
the
racial
designation
on
the
questionnaire
in
this
respect
that
if
all
that
was
going
on
was
what
was
on
the
questionnaire
in
terms
of
occupation,
etcetera,
it
is
not
at
all
clear
why,
what
function,
the
racial
identification
plays
except
to
bring
into
play
personal
knowledge
or
subjective
opinions
of
the
commissioners
about
a
particular
individual
which
is
information
not
reflected
on
the
questionnaire.
the
simple
fact
is
that
the
jury
commission
had
within
its
power
in
this
case
to
come
forward
and
explain
or
to
justify
this
drop
in
proportion
of
blacks
by
showing,
by
either,
number
one,
keeping
a
record
of
the
reasons
why
people
were
disqualified
or
coming
forward
with
questionnaires
which
were
available
to
it.
it
just
simply
did
not
do
this.
in
any
way,
simply
rested
on
assertions
about
how
it
functioned
and
again
in
the
face
of
the
racial
designations
and
the
opportunity
to
discriminate,
we
contend
this
simply
was
not
sufficient.
i
just
make
one
additional
comment
about
one
of
the
questions
on
the
questionnaire
which
possibly
might
have
been
used
to
justify
the
inclusion
of
blacks
and
that
is
the
questions
of
whether
a
person
could
read
or
write
or
what
their
educational
attainments
were.
in
turner
versus
fouche,
this
court
specifically
reserved
in
footnote
22,
the
issue
of
whether
such
a
standard
could
be
used
by
a
state
with
a
history
of
racial
discrimination
in
its
schools
to
justify
a
higher
rate
of
exclusion
of
blacks
from
jury
service.
i
will
point
this
out
not
that
this
issue
should
be
decided
in
this
case
that
that
if
the
state
were
made
to
come
forward
with
an
explanation
of
the
disproportion
and
they
offer
this
as
a
possible
explanation,
this
would
raise
an
entirely
another
issue
arising
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
with
regard
to
whether
this
kind
of
a
standard
was
proper
and
it
had
this
kind
of
a
result.
the
second
issue
in
this
case
involves
the
exclusion
of
women
--
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
i
did
not
--
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
i
am
--
i
may
have
misstated,
i
did
not
mean
different
thing
--
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
i
did
not
mean
different
in
the
sense
of
not
being
racial
discrimination.
what
i
meant
was
that
if
the
state
seeks
to
justify
by
saying
that
blacks
have
a
lower
level
of
educational
attainment
and
that
is
the
reason
they
are
disqualify
disproportionately
and
again
they
have
not
made
this
showing
at
all,
but
if
they
were
to,
this
would
raise
the
issue
which
was
reserved
in
turner
versus
fouche,
whether
or
not
this
kind
of
a
standard,
where
it
had
this
result
in
a
state
with
the
history
of
racial
segregation
could
be
justified
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
now,
the
second
issue
raised
by
this
case
is
the
exclusion
of
women
from,
not
merely
service
on
juries,
but
from
considerations
from
listing,
jury
list
at
all,
article
402
of
louisiana
code
which
is
set
out
in
our
appendix
provides
that
women
shall
not
be
selected
for
jury
service,
that
a
woman
shall
not
be
selected
for
jury
service
unless
she
has
previously
filed
with
the
clerk
of
court
a
written
declaration
of
her
desire
to
be
subject
to
jury
service.
this
is
essentially
the
same
statute
that
was
involved
in
this
court,
in
the
case
of
hoyt
versus
florida,
it
is
virtually
word
per
word
identical
of
florida
statute.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
your
honor,
the
premise
by
my
answer,
i
will
respond
to
your
question,
i
would
say
that
the
court
has
never
held
that
this
was
a
significant
factor
in
jury
discrimination
cases
whether
the
difference
in
the
a
particular
setting,
there
will
be
a
difference
in
a
particular
case.
but
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
say,
in
response
to
your
question
directly
depending
on
the
circumstance.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
maybe
if
i
had
an
opportunity,
getting
again
to
the
merits
of
this
particular
case,
i
have
a
black
woman
on
the
jury
perhaps
so
to
bring
insights
into
maybe
in
this
kind
of
situation.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
yes.
there
--
the
whole
notion
of
the
cross-section
of
the
community
being
represented
on
a
jury
is
to
bring
a
variety
of
insights
into
decisions
of
cases
and
in
a
rape
case
even
though
women
may
have
a
negative
reaction
to,
they
could
very
well
bring
insights
that
men
could
never
have.
it
might
be
the
kind
of
case
where
a
defendant
might
very
well
want
a
woman
--
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
no,
your
honor.
that
is
--
my
argument
says
that
at
any
kinds
of
cases
--
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
that
this
kind
of
exclusion
of
women
at
least
violates
the
due
process
right
to
juries
that
fairly
represent
--
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
pardon?
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
no,
your
honor.
we
have
argued
in
our
brief
that
hoyt
is
sufficiently
distinguishable
on
its
facts.
in
hoyt,
there
were
women
on
the
jury
to
some
extent.
here,
there
were
none
at
all.
three
concurring
opinions
--
concurrence
in
hoyt
indicated
that
they
saw
nothing
in
the
hoyt
record
to
show
actions
of
the
jury
commissioners
that
resulted
in
no
service
of
women.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
no,
your
honor,
except
in
this
sense
and
i
suppose
this
case
will
go
back
down
for
a
new
indictment
and
the
issue
will
be
raised
all
over
again
because
the
system
they
are
using
that
no
women
on
the
jury
list
at
all
and
apparently
there
never
has
been
and
when
there
will
be
is
very
unclear.
and
now
the
supreme
court
of
florida
said
this
is
all
right
and
the
issue
will
just
have
to
be
litigated.
i
think
that
it
would
be
proper
for
this
court
to
cite
the
issue
because
i
think
it
will
clearly
be
raised
again
when
the
case
goes
back
down.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
yes,
your
honor.
this
is
the
grand
jury.
only
the
grand
jury
was
challenged
in
this
case
and
under
past
decisions
of
this
court
were
also
involving
challenges
only
to
grand
jury
the
indictment
falls
and
the
conviction
based
on
that
indictment
falls
as
well.
as
i
said
in
response
to
mr.
justice
brennan’s
question,
we
first
contend
that
this
case
is
distinguishable
from
hoyt
and
that
there
has
been
no
service
of
women
on
the
juries
at
all.
moreover,
petitioner
contends
that
unlike
hoyt,
this
total
exclusion
of
women
is
a
direct
result
of
the
jury
selection
procedures
adopted
by
the
jury
commission.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
to
briefly
recapitulate,
we
have
urged
with
regard
to
issue
two
in
this
case
that
the
total
exclusion
of
women
where
it
is
the
direct
result
of
procedures
used
by
jury
commissioners
as
shown
by
this
record
resulting
in
the
total
exclusion
of
more
than
one-half
of
the
population
of
a
community
results
in
a
jury
system
that
in
the
words
of
this
court
in
carter
contravenes
the
very
idea
of
the
jury
that
is
a
body
truly
representative
of
the
community.
now,
the
reasons
why
a
jury
system
which
excludes
women
or
such
a
system
is
not
representative
had
been
set
out
by
this
court
in
its
decision
in
ballard
versus
united
states
which
we
quote
in
our
brief.
and
basically
by
excluding
this
group,
an
identifiable
group,
it
excludes
from
the
jury
system
a
whole
range
of
attitudes
and
perceptions
that
can
be
brought
to
bear
in
any
criminal
case
and
so
excuse
the
system
drastically
away
from
its
proper
function,
that
is,
its
function
to
as
a
democratic
institution.
again,
as
this
court
said
in
ballard
by
such
an
exclusion
there
is
injury
to
the
jury
system
to
the
laws
of
institution
to
community
at
large
and
of
the
democratic
ideals
reflected
in
the
processes
of
our
court.
a
problem
of
what
lafayette
parish
has
done
pursuant
to
louisiana
law
and
the
problem
with
louisiana
statute
itself
is
that
it
rests
on
assumptions
about
the
function
of
women
in
our
society
which
this
court
has
recently
characterized
in
reed
versus
reed
as
arbitrary.
that
is
assumptions
about
the
proper
role
of
women,
the
notion
of
women
will
automatically
have
such
responsibilities
at
home
that
they
cannot
serve
on
jury.
we
contend
that
a
state
must
devoid
this
kind
of
an
assumption,
this
kind
of
a
procedure
that
results
in
an
unrepresentative
jury
system
and
essentially
treat
women
on
the
same
basis
as
men
are
treated,
that
is
to
focus
in
on
specific
and
well
defined
concerns
that
may
allow
an
exemption,
such
as
occupational
exemptions
or
more
narrow
exemptions
for
women
who
have
special
family
duties
that
would
make
it
a
hardship
for
them
to
serve.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
in
individual
cases,
your
honor.
i
might
just
point
out
as
an
illustration,
florida
after
the
hoyt
decision,
amended
its
statute
allowing
women
who
were
pregnant
or
who
had
children,
i
believe
under
the
age
of
16
to
exercise
the
personal
exemption
if
they
so
wished.
the
problem
with
--
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
they
are
and
the
louisiana
statute,
there
are
personal
exemptions
to
be
exercised
by
the
individual.
the
statute
specifically
says
that
they
are
not
basis
for
challenge
or
cause.
as
a
matter
of
fact
what
lafayette
parish
did
was
not
send
questionnaires
to
even
these
exempted
categories,
although
under
the
statute
it
seems
that
they
should
have
and
allow
those
individuals
to
exercise
their
own
exemption.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
your
honor,
i
think
it
would
be
preferable
to
have
again
an
exemption
that
they
could
exercise
at
least
on
their
wish.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
i
would
say
that
that
kind
of
an
exclusion
would
focus
in
on
a
narrow
class
of
persons.
it
would
not
result
in
a
wholesale
exclusion
of
a
large
group
and
thus
focus
in
on
what
i
think
could
be
said
to
be
a
legitimate
interest,
that
is
they
can
--
given
the
importance
of
decision
and
having
sufficient
numbers
and
positions
available.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
there
would
be
a
rational
basis
for
that
kind
of
a
limited
exclusion
of
a
group
and
again
the
effect
on
jury
system
would
not
be
particularly
extreme
in
terms
of
the
portion,
numbers
of
people
to
be
excluded
and
there
are
other
possible
groups,
that
same
kind
of
exclusion
could
be
exercised.
there
maybe
a
problem
at
some
point
if
there
is
so
many
groups
excluded
that
you
do
result
in
a
system
that
is
unrepresentative.
but
narrow
exemptions
or
exclusions
would,
i
think
be
proper.
now,
finally
on
this
point,
i
just
want
to
bring
out
that,
we
feel
that
any
person
faced
with
a
criminal
procedure
has
the
right
to
object
to
the
exclusion,
this
kind
of
a
wholesale
exclusion
of
a
whole
group
even
though
in
this
case
the
defendant
was
a
male,
that
the
right
to
a
jury
system
that
fairly
represents
a
community
in
light
of
the
proper
function
of
the
jury
to
interpose
between
the
accused
and
the
state,
the
voice
of
the
community.
this
right
extends
to
all
persons
and
not
simply
to
persons
of
the
excluded
class.
and
i
would
just
cite
to
the
court,
two
state
cases
that
have
taken
this
position,
the
case
of
maryland
versus
mattison
213
atlantic
2nd
880,
and
allen
versus
state
of
georgia,
137
southeast
2nd.
711.
i
would
just
like
to
touch
for
a
moment
on
the
third
issue
involved
in
this
case,
that
is
the
use
of
the
statement
taken
from
the
defendant
by
interrogation.
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief
the
issue
with
regard
to
this
question
is
the
effect
of
the
harris
case
and
briefly,
we
would
like
to
urge
that
the
harris
case
is
distinguishable
on,
really
on
two
basis.
the
first
as
you
pointed
out
in
our
brief
is
the
question
of
the
reliability
of
the
statement,
whether
or
not
the
defendant
actually
said
what
he
has
claimed
that
he
said
and
there
are
two
points
on
this,
number
one,
he
denies,
that
is
what
he
said
and
there
is
a
conflict
in
the
testimony
of
two
of
the
police
officers.
one
said
that
he
insisted,
a
number
of
times
he
did
not
commit
the
rape
and
the
other
police
officer
said,
he
did
not
say
that.
in
these
kinds
of
questions
of
reliability,
we
feel
the
statement,
harris
should
not
be
excluded
to
that
kind
of
case.
the
other
basis
of
distinction
is
the
fact
that
in
harris
it
was
admitted
that
the
confession
did
not
comply
with
miranda
and
the
jury
was
specifically
instructed
that
it
could
be
considered
only
for
purpose
of
impeachment.
in
this
case,
the
trial
judge
held
that
the
confession
was
taken
in
compliance
with
miranda
and
that
therefore
presumably
the
use
for
all
purposes
and
an
examination
of
the
record
does
not
reveal
that
the
judge
instructed
the
jury
that
the
confession
could
only
be
used
for
the
limited
purpose
of
impeaching
the
defendant’s
testimony.
there
is
no
so
statement
in
his
overall
charge
of
the
jury
and
there
is
no
such
statement
at
the
time
the
confession
was
brought
up.
the
district
attorney
did
say
at
one
point
that
he
was
going
to
impeach
the
defendant’s
testimony,
but
the
judge
never
instructed
the
juries
to
its
limited
use
without
such
an
instruction.
it
is
simply
cannot
be
assumed
that
the
jury
may
not
have
considered
the
confession
as
in
terms
of
the
proving
of
the
actual
fact
of
the
commission
of
the
crime.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
no,
your
honor.
that
does
not
appear
in
the
record.
again
the
judge
has
held
that
it
did
not
violate
miranda.
so
it
maybe
that
everybody
was
going
on
the
presumption
that
it
could
be
used
for
all
purposes.
but
since
it
did
not
comply
with
miranda,
we
feel
this
is
kind
of
error
that
so
permeates
the
whole
system
that
the
court
can
hold
the
use
of
it
unconstitutional
even
without
a
request
for
limiting
instructions
under
those
circumstances.
i
will
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
yes,
your
honor.
i
just
--
the
main
point
i
want
to
make
was
that
mr.
deblanc
indicated
the
one
reason,
the
racial
designation
was
on
these
papers
was
so
that
they
would
know
how
many
blacks
were
serving.
and
the
point
i
wanted
to
make
is
you
can
compile
racial
statistics
without
having
the
racial
statistic
from
the
racial
information
on
the
documents
that
are
actually
used
by
the
jury
commission.
they
have
no
problem
with
compiling
the
racial
statistics
as
such.
the
point
is
where
they
can
be
used
as
an
opportunity
to
discriminate
as
a
result
here
then
whitus
directed
the
file.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
well,
for
example
if
you
send
out
a
questionnaire
that
has
a
perforated
section
on
par
which
the
person
is
asked
if
he
will
to
respond
to
his
race,
he
is
removed
by
a
clerical
person
that
filed
the
way
and
then
used
after
the
whole
process
has
finished
a
cross
check.
that
might
be
perfectly
alright,
but
this
kind
of
a
system
is
not.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
as
long
as
they
are
not
used
so
there
is
an
opportunity
to
discriminate,
they
compile
statistics
as
such
and
cross
check,
i
would
think
it
would
be
permissible.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
petitioner,
claude
(ph)
alexander
in
this
case
which
is
here
on
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
to
review
the
affirmance
of
petitioner’s
conviction
of
rape.
the
petitioner
is
a
black
male
who
was
convicted
in
lafayette
parish
in
louisiana
and
he
raised
in
the
state
courts
and
raises
here
three
constitutional
challenges
to
his
indictment
and
his
conviction.
first,
he
urges
that
members
of
his
race
were
unconstitutionally
excluded
from
the
jury
list
and
the
venire
from
which
the
grand
jury
that
indicted
him
was
selected.
secondly,
he
urges
that
the
total
exclusion
of
women
from
the
service
from
jury
list,
and
therefore,
from
service
on
juries
in
the
parish
also
denied
him
due
process
of
law
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
finally,
he
urges
that
the
use
at
his
trial
of
a
statement
which
was
taken
without
compliance
the
requirements
of
miranda
versus
arizona
denied
him
due
process
of
law.
with
regard
to
the
first
contention,
the
exclusion
of
blacks
from
jury,
we
urge
basically
that
petitioner
clearly
established
a
prima
facie
case
of
jury
discrimination
within
the
rule
of
the
series
of
cases
beginning
with
avery
versus
georgia
and
proceeding
to
whitus
versus
georgia
and
the
cases
that
followed
whitus
and
i
will
return
to
briefly
discuss
why
we
urge
that
there
is
a
clear
prima
facie
case.
therefore,
the
issue
really
in
this
case
is
whether
the
state
has
offered
a
satisfactory
rebuttal
to
that
prima
facie
case.
in
other
words,
has
the
state
given
a
constitutionally
satisfactory
explanation
to
a
situation
where
a
disproportion
of
black
representation
on
juries
has
been
shown
wherein
the
jury
selection
process
racial
designations
were
before
the
jury
commissioners
when
they
selected
the
persons
who
were
to
be
on
the
jury
list?
in
getting
to
why
a
clear
prima
facie
case
has
been
made
out,
briefly,
the
evidence
introduced
in
the
motion
to
quash
the
indictment
in
the
court
below
showed
that
there
is
a
significant
draw
up
in
the
proportion
of
blacks
on
the
rolls
or
on
the
group
of
persons
who
were
being
considered
for
jury
service
during
stages
in
the
jury
selection
process
when
the
commissioners
were
working
from
documents
on
which
there
appeared
racial
designation.
the
jury
commission
was
operating
under
louisiana
statute
which
required
that
jury
venires
from
at
least
300
persons
be
made
up.
in
this
particular
instance
in
lafayette
parish,
they
went
above
the
minimum
and
established
venires
of
400
persons.
the
louisiana
statute
did
not
set
out
the
procedure
by
which
these
400
persons
are
to
be
arrived
at.
they
do
set
out
qualifications
for
jurors
and
certain
exemptions,
which
are
mostly
exemptions
based
on
occupation
and
physical
disability.
jury
commissioners
worked
from
a
number
of
sources
of
names
as
a
starting
point
to
achieve
the
final
400.
the
main
source
was
voter
registration
list,
a
city
directory
which
covered
the
city
of
lafayette
itself,
telephone
directory
and
certain
other
lists
which
are
not
fully
specified.
initially
there
was
an
objection
raised
because
these
lists
or
at
least
certain
of
them,
the
voter
registration
list
and
the
telephone
directory
were
not
admittedly
fully
representative
of
the
black
community.
that
is
there
is
a
disproportion
of
black
representations
compared
to
the
black
--
to
the
white
disproportion
and
we
urge
that
this
is
one
basis
why
the
jury
selection
method
violated
the
constitution.
however,
when
these
lists
were
used,
the
jury
commissioners
mailed
out
to
prospective
jurors,
a
total
of
11,000
questionnaires
and
received
back
approximately
7,300.
now,
of
those
7,300,
13.67%
were
from
blacks,
and
this
is
in
a
population
--
this
is
black
males
over
21,
that
is,
this
is
in
a
population
where
black
males
over
21
represented
20.27%
of
the
population.
on
the
questionnaires
there
was
a
request
for
the
race
of
the
person
returning
the
questionnaire
and
this
was
filled
in
all,
but
189
of
the
questionnaires.
a
card
was
made
up,
which
also
had
a
racial
designation.
these
7,000
questionnaires
were
then
gone
through
--
through
process
of
--
the
commissioners
say
weeding
out
those
who
were
not
qualified
or
who
might
claim
exemptions
from
the
service
until
approximately
2,000
questionnaires
were
arrived
at.
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
as
to
the
racial
composition
of
that
2,000.
however,
the
2,000
were
then
put
on
a
table
and
from
those
2,000
were
selected
400,
a
white
set
of
paper
having
just
the
name
and
address
of
the
person,
each
of
the
400
persons
was
put
into
a
box
from
which
20-man
grand
jury
venires
would
be
drawn.
in
the
particular
instance
of
petitioner
of
those
20,
one
was
black
and
he
was
not
picked
when
the
final
12-man
venire
was
picked
or
selected
from
the
20.
now,
of
those
400
names
at
the
end
of
the
selection
process,
the
portion
of
blacks
was
down
to
approximately
6.75%
and
it
is
this
–-
this
proportion
together
with
the
fact
that
at
the
time
in
the
process
when
an
overall
population
of
more
than
13%
was
being
examined.
there
were
racial
designations
on
the
documents
used.
there
was
a
clear
opportunity
to
discriminate.
it
was
condemned
by
whitus
and
avery,
coupled
with
a
disproportionate
weeding
out
of
blacks
as
opposed
to
whites
and
it
is
--
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
your
honor,
i
am
just
saying
myself
to
the
stage
when
they
have
the
7,300
questionnaires.
they
went
through
and
disposed
of
those
who
they
see
were
not
qualified.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
that
was
13.76%
black.
now,
when
they
went
up
to
400,
they
were
down
to
6.75%
black.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
that
is
out
of
20%
plus.
the
thing
that
is
not
clear
is
that
when
they
had
weeded
out
the
7,000
down
to
the
2,000
questionnaires
from
which
the
ultimate
400
were
selected,
what
was
the
racial
proportions
of
the
2,000
and
we
pointed
out
that
whichever
way,
whatever
--
whichever
happened,
whether
the
13%
were
reduced
down
to
6%
when
the
weeding
out
process
occurred
or
whether
it
went
from
13%
to
6%
when
the
final
400
were
drawn,
either
way
a
prima
facie
case
has
been
made
out
because
in
both
times
there
were
racial
designations
available
to
the
commissioners
to
use
during
this
--
during
the
process.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
your
honor,
we
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
we
have
urged
that
the
entire
process
has
to
be
looked
at,
that
whether
--
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
i
think
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
that
a
serious
constitutional
question
arises
just
from
that
shrinkage
because
the
jury
commissioners
admitted
that
the
sources,
at
least
two
of
the
sources,
the
voter
registration
rules
and
the
telephone
book
underrepresented
the
black
population.
so
that
they
knew
they
were
getting
a
greater
response
from
whites
and
the
court
has
indicated
that
for
sometime
that
where
--
that
there
is
a
duty
on
the
jury
commissioners
not
to
use
methods
that
they
know
are
going
to
result
in
a
underrepresentation
so
that
there
is
not
a
reasonable
cross-section
of
the
community.
we
do
not
rely
on
that
solely,
but
we
do
urge
the
entire
process
has
to
be
looked
at
because
the
ultimate
end
of
this
process
was
a
drop
from
20%
down
to
6.75%.
now,
we
again
feel
that
the
use
of
these
questionnaires
with
racial
designations
on
the
drop
of
proportion
brings
this
case
directly
under
avery
and
whitus
and
the
issue
is
essentially
whether
the
state
has
sufficiently
rebutted
this
prima
facie
case.
in
words
of
whitus,
has
the
state
offered
any
testimony
that
the
percentage
of
negroes
on
the
tax
digest
were
not
fully
qualified.
here
we
are
dealing
with
the
percentage
of
blacks
responding
to
the
questionnaires.
has
a
state
given
any
objective
evidence
that
the
proportion
of
blacks
qualified,
who
responded
to
these
questionnaires
was
not
as
fully
qualified
as
the
whites
who
responded
to
the
questionnaires
and
essentially
again
we
say
they
have
not.
they
testified
of
course
that
they
do
not
take
race
into
consideration
in
making
their
selections,
but
this
court
has
held
in
numerous
instances
that
such
protestations
are
not
sufficient
to
rebut
a
prima
facie
case.
they
say
that
they
apply
these
various
objective
criteria
that
are
on
the
face
of
the
questionnaire.
this,
however,
conflicts
with
the
presence
of
the
racial
designation
on
the
questionnaire
in
this
respect
that
if
all
that
was
going
on
was
what
was
on
the
questionnaire
in
terms
of
occupation,
etcetera,
it
is
not
at
all
clear
why,
what
function,
the
racial
identification
plays
except
to
bring
into
play
personal
knowledge
or
subjective
opinions
of
the
commissioners
about
a
particular
individual
which
is
information
not
reflected
on
the
questionnaire.
the
simple
fact
is
that
the
jury
commission
had
within
its
power
in
this
case
to
come
forward
and
explain
or
to
justify
this
drop
in
proportion
of
blacks
by
showing,
by
either,
number
one,
keeping
a
record
of
the
reasons
why
people
were
disqualified
or
coming
forward
with
questionnaires
which
were
available
to
it.
it
just
simply
did
not
do
this.
in
any
way,
simply
rested
on
assertions
about
how
it
functioned
and
again
in
the
face
of
the
racial
designations
and
the
opportunity
to
discriminate,
we
contend
this
simply
was
not
sufficient.
i
just
make
one
additional
comment
about
one
of
the
questions
on
the
questionnaire
which
possibly
might
have
been
used
to
justify
the
inclusion
of
blacks
and
that
is
the
questions
of
whether
a
person
could
read
or
write
or
what
their
educational
attainments
were.
in
turner
versus
fouche,
this
court
specifically
reserved
in
footnote
22,
the
issue
of
whether
such
a
standard
could
be
used
by
a
state
with
a
history
of
racial
discrimination
in
its
schools
to
justify
a
higher
rate
of
exclusion
of
blacks
from
jury
service.
i
will
point
this
out
not
that
this
issue
should
be
decided
in
this
case
that
that
if
the
state
were
made
to
come
forward
with
an
explanation
of
the
disproportion
and
they
offer
this
as
a
possible
explanation,
this
would
raise
an
entirely
another
issue
arising
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
with
regard
to
whether
this
kind
of
a
standard
was
proper
and
it
had
this
kind
of
a
result.
the
second
issue
in
this
case
involves
the
exclusion
of
women
--
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
i
did
not
--
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
i
am
--
i
may
have
misstated,
i
did
not
mean
different
thing
--
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
i
did
not
mean
different
in
the
sense
of
not
being
racial
discrimination.
what
i
meant
was
that
if
the
state
seeks
to
justify
by
saying
that
blacks
have
a
lower
level
of
educational
attainment
and
that
is
the
reason
they
are
disqualify
disproportionately
and
again
they
have
not
made
this
showing
at
all,
but
if
they
were
to,
this
would
raise
the
issue
which
was
reserved
in
turner
versus
fouche,
whether
or
not
this
kind
of
a
standard,
where
it
had
this
result
in
a
state
with
the
history
of
racial
segregation
could
be
justified
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
now,
the
second
issue
raised
by
this
case
is
the
exclusion
of
women
from,
not
merely
service
on
juries,
but
from
considerations
from
listing,
jury
list
at
all,
article
402
of
louisiana
code
which
is
set
out
in
our
appendix
provides
that
women
shall
not
be
selected
for
jury
service,
that
a
woman
shall
not
be
selected
for
jury
service
unless
she
has
previously
filed
with
the
clerk
of
court
a
written
declaration
of
her
desire
to
be
subject
to
jury
service.
this
is
essentially
the
same
statute
that
was
involved
in
this
court,
in
the
case
of
hoyt
versus
florida,
it
is
virtually
word
per
word
identical
of
florida
statute.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
your
honor,
the
premise
by
my
answer,
i
will
respond
to
your
question,
i
would
say
that
the
court
has
never
held
that
this
was
a
significant
factor
in
jury
discrimination
cases
whether
the
difference
in
the
a
particular
setting,
there
will
be
a
difference
in
a
particular
case.
but
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
say,
in
response
to
your
question
directly
depending
on
the
circumstance.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
maybe
if
i
had
an
opportunity,
getting
again
to
the
merits
of
this
particular
case,
i
have
a
black
woman
on
the
jury
perhaps
so
to
bring
insights
into
maybe
in
this
kind
of
situation.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
yes.
there
--
the
whole
notion
of
the
cross-section
of
the
community
being
represented
on
a
jury
is
to
bring
a
variety
of
insights
into
decisions
of
cases
and
in
a
rape
case
even
though
women
may
have
a
negative
reaction
to,
they
could
very
well
bring
insights
that
men
could
never
have.
it
might
be
the
kind
of
case
where
a
defendant
might
very
well
want
a
woman
--
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
no,
your
honor.
that
is
--
my
argument
says
that
at
any
kinds
of
cases
--
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
that
this
kind
of
exclusion
of
women
at
least
violates
the
due
process
right
to
juries
that
fairly
represent
--
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
pardon?
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
no,
your
honor.
we
have
argued
in
our
brief
that
hoyt
is
sufficiently
distinguishable
on
its
facts.
in
hoyt,
there
were
women
on
the
jury
to
some
extent.
here,
there
were
none
at
all.
three
concurring
opinions
--
concurrence
in
hoyt
indicated
that
they
saw
nothing
in
the
hoyt
record
to
show
actions
of
the
jury
commissioners
that
resulted
in
no
service
of
women.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
no,
your
honor,
except
in
this
sense
and
i
suppose
this
case
will
go
back
down
for
a
new
indictment
and
the
issue
will
be
raised
all
over
again
because
the
system
they
are
using
that
no
women
on
the
jury
list
at
all
and
apparently
there
never
has
been
and
when
there
will
be
is
very
unclear.
and
now
the
supreme
court
of
florida
said
this
is
all
right
and
the
issue
will
just
have
to
be
litigated.
i
think
that
it
would
be
proper
for
this
court
to
cite
the
issue
because
i
think
it
will
clearly
be
raised
again
when
the
case
goes
back
down.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
yes,
your
honor.
this
is
the
grand
jury.
only
the
grand
jury
was
challenged
in
this
case
and
under
past
decisions
of
this
court
were
also
involving
challenges
only
to
grand
jury
the
indictment
falls
and
the
conviction
based
on
that
indictment
falls
as
well.
as
i
said
in
response
to
mr.
justice
brennan’s
question,
we
first
contend
that
this
case
is
distinguishable
from
hoyt
and
that
there
has
been
no
service
of
women
on
the
juries
at
all.
moreover,
petitioner
contends
that
unlike
hoyt,
this
total
exclusion
of
women
is
a
direct
result
of
the
jury
selection
procedures
adopted
by
the
jury
commission.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
to
briefly
recapitulate,
we
have
urged
with
regard
to
issue
two
in
this
case
that
the
total
exclusion
of
women
where
it
is
the
direct
result
of
procedures
used
by
jury
commissioners
as
shown
by
this
record
resulting
in
the
total
exclusion
of
more
than
one-half
of
the
population
of
a
community
results
in
a
jury
system
that
in
the
words
of
this
court
in
carter
contravenes
the
very
idea
of
the
jury
that
is
a
body
truly
representative
of
the
community.
now,
the
reasons
why
a
jury
system
which
excludes
women
or
such
a
system
is
not
representative
had
been
set
out
by
this
court
in
its
decision
in
ballard
versus
united
states
which
we
quote
in
our
brief.
and
basically
by
excluding
this
group,
an
identifiable
group,
it
excludes
from
the
jury
system
a
whole
range
of
attitudes
and
perceptions
that
can
be
brought
to
bear
in
any
criminal
case
and
so
excuse
the
system
drastically
away
from
its
proper
function,
that
is,
its
function
to
as
a
democratic
institution.
again,
as
this
court
said
in
ballard
by
such
an
exclusion
there
is
injury
to
the
jury
system
to
the
laws
of
institution
to
community
at
large
and
of
the
democratic
ideals
reflected
in
the
processes
of
our
court.
a
problem
of
what
lafayette
parish
has
done
pursuant
to
louisiana
law
and
the
problem
with
louisiana
statute
itself
is
that
it
rests
on
assumptions
about
the
function
of
women
in
our
society
which
this
court
has
recently
characterized
in
reed
versus
reed
as
arbitrary.
that
is
assumptions
about
the
proper
role
of
women,
the
notion
of
women
will
automatically
have
such
responsibilities
at
home
that
they
cannot
serve
on
jury.
we
contend
that
a
state
must
devoid
this
kind
of
an
assumption,
this
kind
of
a
procedure
that
results
in
an
unrepresentative
jury
system
and
essentially
treat
women
on
the
same
basis
as
men
are
treated,
that
is
to
focus
in
on
specific
and
well
defined
concerns
that
may
allow
an
exemption,
such
as
occupational
exemptions
or
more
narrow
exemptions
for
women
who
have
special
family
duties
that
would
make
it
a
hardship
for
them
to
serve.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
in
individual
cases,
your
honor.
i
might
just
point
out
as
an
illustration,
florida
after
the
hoyt
decision,
amended
its
statute
allowing
women
who
were
pregnant
or
who
had
children,
i
believe
under
the
age
of
16
to
exercise
the
personal
exemption
if
they
so
wished.
the
problem
with
--
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
they
are
and
the
louisiana
statute,
there
are
personal
exemptions
to
be
exercised
by
the
individual.
the
statute
specifically
says
that
they
are
not
basis
for
challenge
or
cause.
as
a
matter
of
fact
what
lafayette
parish
did
was
not
send
questionnaires
to
even
these
exempted
categories,
although
under
the
statute
it
seems
that
they
should
have
and
allow
those
individuals
to
exercise
their
own
exemption.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
your
honor,
i
think
it
would
be
preferable
to
have
again
an
exemption
that
they
could
exercise
at
least
on
their
wish.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
i
would
say
that
that
kind
of
an
exclusion
would
focus
in
on
a
narrow
class
of
persons.
it
would
not
result
in
a
wholesale
exclusion
of
a
large
group
and
thus
focus
in
on
what
i
think
could
be
said
to
be
a
legitimate
interest,
that
is
they
can
--
given
the
importance
of
decision
and
having
sufficient
numbers
and
positions
available.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
there
would
be
a
rational
basis
for
that
kind
of
a
limited
exclusion
of
a
group
and
again
the
effect
on
jury
system
would
not
be
particularly
extreme
in
terms
of
the
portion,
numbers
of
people
to
be
excluded
and
there
are
other
possible
groups,
that
same
kind
of
exclusion
could
be
exercised.
there
maybe
a
problem
at
some
point
if
there
is
so
many
groups
excluded
that
you
do
result
in
a
system
that
is
unrepresentative.
but
narrow
exemptions
or
exclusions
would,
i
think
be
proper.
now,
finally
on
this
point,
i
just
want
to
bring
out
that,
we
feel
that
any
person
faced
with
a
criminal
procedure
has
the
right
to
object
to
the
exclusion,
this
kind
of
a
wholesale
exclusion
of
a
whole
group
even
though
in
this
case
the
defendant
was
a
male,
that
the
right
to
a
jury
system
that
fairly
represents
a
community
in
light
of
the
proper
function
of
the
jury
to
interpose
between
the
accused
and
the
state,
the
voice
of
the
community.
this
right
extends
to
all
persons
and
not
simply
to
persons
of
the
excluded
class.
and
i
would
just
cite
to
the
court,
two
state
cases
that
have
taken
this
position,
the
case
of
maryland
versus
mattison
213
atlantic
2nd
880,
and
allen
versus
state
of
georgia,
137
southeast
2nd.
711.
i
would
just
like
to
touch
for
a
moment
on
the
third
issue
involved
in
this
case,
that
is
the
use
of
the
statement
taken
from
the
defendant
by
interrogation.
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief
the
issue
with
regard
to
this
question
is
the
effect
of
the
harris
case
and
briefly,
we
would
like
to
urge
that
the
harris
case
is
distinguishable
on,
really
on
two
basis.
the
first
as
you
pointed
out
in
our
brief
is
the
question
of
the
reliability
of
the
statement,
whether
or
not
the
defendant
actually
said
what
he
has
claimed
that
he
said
and
there
are
two
points
on
this,
number
one,
he
denies,
that
is
what
he
said
and
there
is
a
conflict
in
the
testimony
of
two
of
the
police
officers.
one
said
that
he
insisted,
a
number
of
times
he
did
not
commit
the
rape
and
the
other
police
officer
said,
he
did
not
say
that.
in
these
kinds
of
questions
of
reliability,
we
feel
the
statement,
harris
should
not
be
excluded
to
that
kind
of
case.
the
other
basis
of
distinction
is
the
fact
that
in
harris
it
was
admitted
that
the
confession
did
not
comply
with
miranda
and
the
jury
was
specifically
instructed
that
it
could
be
considered
only
for
purpose
of
impeachment.
in
this
case,
the
trial
judge
held
that
the
confession
was
taken
in
compliance
with
miranda
and
that
therefore
presumably
the
use
for
all
purposes
and
an
examination
of
the
record
does
not
reveal
that
the
judge
instructed
the
jury
that
the
confession
could
only
be
used
for
the
limited
purpose
of
impeaching
the
defendant’s
testimony.
there
is
no
so
statement
in
his
overall
charge
of
the
jury
and
there
is
no
such
statement
at
the
time
the
confession
was
brought
up.
the
district
attorney
did
say
at
one
point
that
he
was
going
to
impeach
the
defendant’s
testimony,
but
the
judge
never
instructed
the
juries
to
its
limited
use
without
such
an
instruction.
it
is
simply
cannot
be
assumed
that
the
jury
may
not
have
considered
the
confession
as
in
terms
of
the
proving
of
the
actual
fact
of
the
commission
of
the
crime.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
no,
your
honor.
that
does
not
appear
in
the
record.
again
the
judge
has
held
that
it
did
not
violate
miranda.
so
it
maybe
that
everybody
was
going
on
the
presumption
that
it
could
be
used
for
all
purposes.
but
since
it
did
not
comply
with
miranda,
we
feel
this
is
kind
of
error
that
so
permeates
the
whole
system
that
the
court
can
hold
the
use
of
it
unconstitutional
even
without
a
request
for
limiting
instructions
under
those
circumstances.
i
will
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
yes,
your
honor.
i
just
--
the
main
point
i
want
to
make
was
that
mr.
deblanc
indicated
the
one
reason,
the
racial
designation
was
on
these
papers
was
so
that
they
would
know
how
many
blacks
were
serving.
and
the
point
i
wanted
to
make
is
you
can
compile
racial
statistics
without
having
the
racial
statistic
from
the
racial
information
on
the
documents
that
are
actually
used
by
the
jury
commission.
they
have
no
problem
with
compiling
the
racial
statistics
as
such.
the
point
is
where
they
can
be
used
as
an
opportunity
to
discriminate
as
a
result
here
then
whitus
directed
the
file.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
well,
for
example
if
you
send
out
a
questionnaire
that
has
a
perforated
section
on
par
which
the
person
is
asked
if
he
will
to
respond
to
his
race,
he
is
removed
by
a
clerical
person
that
filed
the
way
and
then
used
after
the
whole
process
has
finished
a
cross
check.
that
might
be
perfectly
alright,
but
this
kind
of
a
system
is
not.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
as
long
as
they
are
not
used
so
there
is
an
opportunity
to
discriminate,
they
compile
statistics
as
such
and
cross
check,
i
would
think
it
would
be
permissible.
