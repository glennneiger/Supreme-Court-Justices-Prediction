mr.
morris
a.
shenker
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
an
indictment
that
was
returned
in
the
city
of
st.
louis
charging
a
labor
union,
local
562
--
pipefitters
union
local
number
562
and
three
individuals
that
conspire
to
make
unlawful
--
to
make
political
contributions
from
that
local.
the
indictment
in
the
case
alleged
that
a
political
fund
was
established
from
which
fund
contributions
would
be
made
and
the
indictment
stated
that
this
fund
was
the
fund
of
the
local
union.
there
was
no
allegation
in
the
indictment
that
the
contributions
were
made
involuntary
by
the
members
of
the
union
and
non-members
of
the
union
who
worked
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
union,
who
made
these
contributions.
and
the
indictment
alleges
that
as
part
of
that
scheme
or
artifacts
that
the
funds
were
collected
by
officers,
stewards,
members,
and
employees
of
the
fund
--
that
is
of
the
union
and
they
were
also
collecting
that
the
members
and
the
officers
of
the
union
were
collecting
for
the
fund.
pre-trial
motions
were
filed
and
in
the
pre-trial
motions,
it
was
alleged
that
the
indictment
was
attacked
on
the
ground
that
it
was
not
charged
that
the
contributions
were
made
involuntarily
on
the
ground
that
it
was
not
alleged
in
the
indictment
that
the
payments
were
union
dues
and
that
the
gist
of
the
pre-trial
motion
was
--
and
the
gist
was
that
this
was
really
a
parallel
political
fund
that
was
set
up
by
the
union
and
that
for
purpose
of
receiving
and
making
political
expenditures.
receiving
political
contributions
or
making
political
expenditures
and
we
contended
that
there
was
no
violation
shown
on
the
face
of
the
indictment.
a
bill
of
particulars
was
requested
but
instead
of
the
bill
of
particulars,
the
government
merely
filed
a
court
memorandum
and
in
that
memorandum,
the
government
stated
that
it
was
not
necessary
that
it
was
no
necessity
to
prove
that
the
funds
were
not
volunteered.
that
voluntariness
was
not
an
essence
of
the
crime
that
was
charged.
the
government's
theory
of
the
case
at
the
trial
was
that
they
submitted
an
instruction
and
that
instruction
which
was
set
up
in
appellants
and
petitioners’
brief
in
pages
12
and
13
lists
a
number
of
grounds.
the
original
10
grounds
which
are
listed
on
page
12
were
submitted
by
the
government
and
that
the
request
of
the
defendants’
additional
grounds
were
at
it
and
that
basis,
the
court
instructed
the
jury
and
gave
that
as
the
task
that
those
are
the
matters
which
the
jury
could
consider
whether
the
fund
was
in
fact
a
fund
of
the
union
or
rather
that
was
a
voluntary
political
fund.
that
was
established
by
the
union.
the
defendants’
requested
instructions
where
in
it
would
specifically
state
as
to
that
making
voluntary
payments
as
a
defense
and
the
court
said
in
the
instruction
however,
the
mere
fact
that
the
payments
into
the
fund
may
have
been
made
voluntary
by
some
or
even
all
of
the
contributors
thereto
does
not
of
itself.
the
court
said
it
means
that
the
monies
that
were
paid
into
the
fund
was
not
union
money
and
it
is
on
that
theory
on
which
the
case
was
tried.
the
defendants
also
submitted
two
instructions
which
i
will
refer
to
later.
they
submitted
many
instructions,
but
two
particular
instructions
which
we
thought
set
up
specifically
the
law
that
should
be
governed
in
accordance
with
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court.
but
the
court
refused
all
of
the
requested
instructions
from
the
defendants
and
the
only
ones
that
the
court
incorporated
were
those
which
are
set
out
in
the
footnote
on
page
20.
now
the
facts
were
as
follows.
but
first
let
me
say
this,
let
me
say
this.
the
jury
found
the
defendants
guilty
and
the
individuals
as
well
as
the
union?
the
union
was
fined
$5,000.00
and
each
defendant
was
sentenced
to
one
year
in
jail
and
a
punishment,
an
additional
fine
of
$1,000.00.
the
history
of
the
fund
is
this.
in
1949,
a
political
fund
was
established
by
this,
a
voluntary
political
fund
was
established
by
this
union
and
it
was
administered
independently
openly
and
notoriously
and
they
made
contributions
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
from
1949
on
until
the
date
of
the
conviction.
but
there
was
one
change
that
took
place
in
this
fund
in
1963.
the
union
negotiated
a
contract
with
the
employers
who
provided
for
a
check
off
system
and
when
they
provided
for
the
check
off
system,
they
consulted
with
their
lawyer,
a
very
prominent
labor
lawyer
in
the
st.
louis
who
has
devoted
most
of
his
lifetime
to
labor
law,
mr.
harry
craig
whose
name
is
mentioned
and
who
was
a
witness
in
the
case.
and
mr.
craig
at
that
time
suggested,
in
view
of
a
decision
that
was
in
the
law
that
prevailed
that
the
eastern
district
of
missouri.
it
was
a
case
wherein
the
teamsters
were
prosecuted
at
local
688
was
prosecuted
for
making
contributions
from
the
union
to
which
the
judge
sustained
a
motion
to
dismiss
after
the
evidence
was
in
on
the
ground
that
this
was
--
that
the
money
came
in
voluntarily
to
the
union.
mr.
craig
first
suggested
that
there
should
be
a
check
off
of
the
political
contributions
that
is
the
voluntary
political
contributions
in
the
same
manner
as
they
checked
off
the
other
monies
that
was
collected
by
the
union
but
it
would
be
paid
specifically
to
the
voluntary
political
fund.
after
a
while,
mr.
craig
changed
his
mind
and
provided
a
form
which
was
to
be
filled
out
by
each
of
the
members
that
wanted
to
contribute
to
the
political
fund
and
that
is
where
in
they
provided
and
stated
in
the
form
that
they
are
willing
to
make
voluntary
contributions.
they
are
willing
to
contribute
so
much
per
day’s
work
and
that
they
can
cancel
that
whenever
they
desire.
they
can
discontinue
giving
that
money
and
that
they
understood
it
is
voluntary
and
that
they
understood
specifically
that
this
money
is
being
given
for
political
and
other
purposes
to
be
administered
by
this
independent
fund.
after
that
was
done,
then
it
was
decided
to
continue
to
collect
the
money
in
the
same
manner
which
they
did
before.
that
is
the
foreman
or
the
stewards
on
the
job
continued
to
collect
the
money
and
send
it
in
to
this
political
organization,
that
is
to
this
voluntary
of
political,
charitable,
and
educational
fund.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
yes.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
no
sir,
this
was
a
complete
fund
--
a
fund
that
was
all
put
in
together
of
all
the
people
that
contributed
and
then
those
people
and
then
they
have
political
meetings
often
and
would
endorse
candidates
and
they
had
an
administrator
of
the
fund
who
could
act
as
he
sought
it
and
that
which
have
brought
powers
to
act.
but
an
answer
to
that
question,
i
might
tell
you,
that
it
so
happens
that
most
of
the
contributors
that
does
–-
well,
i
put
it
like
this,
all
the
witnesses
that
testified
were
testified
that
they
were
democrats
and
they
contributed
to
the
democratic
party
and
then
one
person
that
testified,
he
said
he
was
a
republican
and
that
he
did
not
contribute
to
the
fund.
that
was
one
of
the
witnesses
that
testified
so
that
--
that
question
would
answer
your
question
directly.
they
did
not
specify.
well,
they
could
stop
contributing
anytime
they
wanted.
of
the
evidence
that
was
offered,
the
government
introduced
12
stewards
and
foreman
who
collected
the
money.
some
of
those,
at
least
one
foreman
as
i
recall,
it
is
in
the
record
testified
that
even
though
he
collected
contributions,
he
himself
never
contributed.
they
also
testified
that
in
many
of
these
other
government
witnesses.
they
also
testified
that
in
many
instances,
when
some
people
did
not
contribute
that
he
called
and
asked
the
director
or
other
people
who
were
in
charge
of
the
fund
and
they
told
him
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
that
is
strictly
voluntary.
and
that
that
went
on
two
years.
and
additionally,
77
witnesses
testified
before
the
defendant
and
there
out
of
those
77,
32
testified
that
they
either
never
contributed
to
the
voluntary
political
fund
either
contributed
that
sometimes
and
not
contributed
at
other
times
or
contributed
whenever
they
felt
like
it
as
many
times
they
did
not
contribute.
the
testimony
also
shows
that
while
there
was
a
complete
record
kept
of
the
money
that
was
received
that
there
was
no
way
from
the
records
to
determine
if
anyone
paid
often
full
or
continuously
paid
or
whether
there
was
a
way
of
finding
out
from
the
records
if
a
person
was
delinquent
and
did
not
pay.
the
evidence
also
showed
that
no
effort
was
ever
made
to
get
people
to
pay
off
anything
that
may
have
been
delinquent
or
that
they
may
not
have
paid
in
accordance
with
their
written
instrument
wherein
they
agreed
to
contribute
to
the
voluntary
fund.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
i
do
not
recall
that.
it
does
not
show,
your
honor.
but
for
the
sake
of
discussion,
i
think
while
the
record
does
not
show
i
would
have
to
say
that
a
large
number
of
the
people
of
the
members
of
the
union
as
well
as
the
people
that
worked
under
the
jurisdiction
of
that
union
did
sign
that
agreement.
it
was
a
fund
that
was
administered,
that
had
separate
bank
accounts.
they
have
a
separate
name.
they
made
payments
out
of
that
fund
by
check.
it
was
audited.
there
was
--
no
discrepancies
were
found.
the
government
agents
had
the
(inaudible)
over
a
period
or
year,
in
fact
that
it
turned
them
to
us
just
before
the
trial
and
they
testified
they
could
find
no
shortages
of
any
kind.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
yes,
it
was
sometimes
in
connection
with
the
charitable
contributions.
substantial
amounts
were
used
in
connection
with
charitable
contributions.
on
one
occasion,
there
was
a
contribution
made
towards
some
payment
on
behalf
of
some
people
that
were
benefits.
it
was
not
in
the
union
benefits.
it
was
made
as
a
contribution.
they
also
invested
some
money
in
buying
a
place
in
clarksville,
missouri
which
is
about
approximately
60
miles
from
the
city
where
the
main
office
is
which
place
--
that
it
were
going
to
have
recreation
facilities
where
it
could
also
hold
political
meetings
and
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
no
sir.
no
sir,
it
was
a
facility
belonging
to
a
voluntary
fund.
voluntary
political
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
no
sir,
the
people
that
paid
into
the
fund
would
use
it.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
and
then
it
was
next
to
--
it
was
next
to
another
facility
that
was
helped
by
the
welfare
fund
of
the
said
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
well,
we
say
that
that
is
not
an
issue,
that
we
say
that
this
was
money
that
was
given
specifically
for
that
purpose.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
well,
we
are
not
challenging
it
that
way
unless,
unless
this
court
were
to
hold
--
unless
this
court
were
to
hold
that
we
are
not
permitted
to
do
what
we
did,
that
of
course,
we
would
challenge.
but
basically
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
let
us
put
it
like
this
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
we
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
the
law.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
not
in
so
many
words.
we
did
not
challenge
it
because
we
do
not
consider
that
dues
and
we
never
did
consider
that
dues.
in
other
words,
the
question
is
this?
we
did
not
consider
that
dues.
so
therefore,
we
did
not
challenge
the
law
on
that
manner.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
i
do
not
think
so.
we
did
not.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
we
asked
that
this
was
vague
and
indefinite
and
uncertain.
we
did
contend
that
that
the
law
was
vague
and
we
will
point
out
to
you
particularly
that
it
is
vague
insofar
in
the
manner
in
which
it
was
construed
by
the
lower
court
that
the
law
is
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
right.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
yes.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
that
is
exactly
our
contention,
that
this
is
not
a
contribution
by
a
labor
organization.
but
we
say
that
if
it
is
being
held
unconstitutional
--
if
it
is
being
held
unconstitutional,
in
other
words
if
the
interpretation
that
was
given
to
the
lower
court,
we
say
it
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
here.
but
we
are
not
challenging
it
at
this
point
because
we
are
really
not
concerned.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
well,
that
seems
to
be
the
understanding
accepting
in
our
district,
and
if
i
may
just
say
the
cause
of
good
faith
as
for
as
we
are
concerned,
that
is
important
in
this
case
and
that
is
why
i
am
going
to
say
that
because
we
do
not
have
to
advise
of
counsel
all
the
way
on
it.
and
that
is
just
that
we
did
have
a
case
where
a
union.
the
teamsters
union
local
5688
made
a
contribution
and
they
tried
them
and
the
court
sustained
a
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal
and
the
government
did
not
appeal
but
what
happened
there
was
this
where
they
did
as
the
following
that
members
were
able
to
designate
to
the
union
that
a
part,
a
certain
part
of
their
dues
shall
be
used
for
political
purposes.
in
other
words,
in
the
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
that
is
right.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
that
is
correct.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
that
is
correct.
a
parallel
organization
that
was
established
by
local
562
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
that
is
correct.
you
brought
me
right
to
the
very
important
question
that
we
have
here.
the
court
instructed
on
the
question
about
that
it
was
not
necessary
that
a
contribution
be
voluntary.
in
other
words,
we
say
that
it
did
not
make
any
difference
whether
the
contribution
was
voluntary
or
not
voluntary
but
at
a
trial
below
in
the
district
court
somehow
the
government
just
did
not
get
around
to
ever
say
that
it
was
perfectly
proper
to
have
a
parallel
organization
which
could
make
political
contribution
as
long
as
those
contributions
are
voluntarily
received
and
that
it
was
perfectly
alright
for
the
officers
and
the
agents
of
the
union
and
the
employees
of
the
union
to
participate
in
it.
now,
on
appeal,
for
the
first
time,
the
government
and
they
agreed
says
that
it
is
proper
to
have
such
an
organization
as
long
as
the
contributions
are
voluntary.
now
we
submit
that
the
least
we
should
have
that
is
that
question
determined
--
be
submitted
to
the
jury
to
determine
whether
the
contributions
were
or
were
not
voluntary.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
that
is
correct.
with
this
exception
and
as
i
say
you
do
not
have
to
reach
that.
you
do
not
have
to
reach
that
because
we
contend
that
this
was
not
a
contribution
by
a
labor
union.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
but
i
want
you
to
keep
in
mind
the
teamsters
case
and
say
look
which
was
the
law
in
our
district
at
that
time,
which
law
could
be
liable
where
it
said
that
if
it
is
a
voluntary
contribution
--
that
is
a
voluntary
contribution
to
the
union
that
the
union
could
pass
that
money
on.
but
we
do
not
have
to
reach
that
right
now.
we
are
not
concerned
with
that
because
we
contend
that
this
was
not
a
contribution
of
the
union.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
yes
sir.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
well,
the
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
we
have
an
office
next
door,
right
across
the
hall
from
the
union.
in
other
words
it
is
a
large
building
occupied
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
yes
sir
and
here
is
who
they
were.
they
were
local
562
had
jurisdiction
of
certain
large
jobs.
now
there
are
small
unions
in
the
areas
of
the
outside
of
missouri
who
are
not
equipped
to
handle
large
jobs.
so
local
562
would
have
jurisdiction
of
large
jobs
and
those
instances
some
of
the
employees
that
were
members
of
the
other
locals
would
come
and
work
on
these
jobs.
now
under
the
lehman
griffith
(ph)
originally
they
used
to
pay
$8.00
a
month
as
a
contribution
to
the
union.
under
the
lehman
griffin
(ph)
law,
mr.
craig,
the
union
attorney
said
that
it
would
be
some
question
that
if
they
are
permitted
to
pay
the
$8.00
per
month
that
therefore
they
would
have
to
be
permitted
to
join
later
the
union
and
which
would
make
this
local
entirely
too
big
and
they
would
not
be
justified
that
expenditure
rose
that
way.
so
for
that
reason,
they
abandoned
the
$8.00
completely,
but
the
people
that
worked
on
those
jobs
some
of
them
did
contribute
to
the
political
fund.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
not
all,
they
receive
more
than
that.
they
contribute
as
much
as
$2.00
a
day.
in
other
words,
they
contributed
and
started
off
at
a
dollar
a
day
and
it
finally
went
to
$2.00
a
day.
but
it
was
all
voluntary
and
the
evidence
showed
that
many
of
them
testified
that
they
did
not
--
many
of
them
did
not
contribute
at
all
as
they
did
not
affect
their
job.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
that
is
where
you
finally
wind
up
being
tried.
we
did
not
know
what
was
being
tried
to
be
perfectly
frank
about
it.
but
we
finally
wound
up
that
that
is
what
was
being
tried.
that
was
tried
that
this
was
a
shame
in
the
scheme
to
put
a
union
to
make
political
contributions.
now
the
reason
that
was
voluntariness
was
important
because
if
the
people
made
the
contributions
voluntarily,
why
would
they
make
that
contribution
if
the
union
was
to
put
him
on
pressure
unless
it
was
voluntarily.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
i
think
that
is
correct.
that
was
an
attempt
made
to
do
it
in
that
way.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
that
is
being
thrust
that
the
instructions
to
the
jury
and
if
you
will
look
at
pages
72
and
73
of
the
defendants’
briefs
and
which
were
the
instructions
that
we
requested,
there
are
many
others
but
two
of
them
particular
there
and
if
i
could
just
take
one
second
to
read
of
them
at
least
where
that
is
on
page
72
where
we
said,
the
court
instructs
the
jury
that
the
law
permits
labor
union
members
to
set
up
a
fund
or
organization
for
the
collection
of
money
to
be
used
for
making
contributions
to
candidates
for
federal
political
office.
the
law
merely
prohibits
labor
union
money
from
being
used
for
such
purpose.
therefore,
if
you
find
that
contributions
made
to
the
political,
educational,
legislative,
charity
and
defense
fund
were
made
by
members
of
local
562
voluntarily
and
did
not
constitute
the
payment
of
union
dues
or
labor
union
money,
you
must
find
the
defendants
not
guilty.
now
the
court
refused,
they
gave
these
instructions
in
various
ways
and
the
court
refused
this
particular
instruction
in
every
way.
now,
it
was
not
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
yes.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
yes.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
if
those
contributions
are
made
voluntary.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
only
if
they
are
made
voluntary.
in
other
words,
and
secondly
we
would
say
that
it
is
vague
that
it
does
not
spell
out
just
what
you
can
and
what
you
cannot
do.
and
that
it
is
restrictive
as
far
as
the
first
amendment
is
concerned.
but
now
the
point
that
we
pointed
out,
that
was
a
complete
like
getting
back
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
yes
sir.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
i
would
say
certainly
the
way
they
handled
the
teamsters
case
in
st.
louis
that
it
does
permit
it.
in
other
words,
it
would
automatically
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
now,
i
would
say
it
does.
it
would
automatically
become
a
special
fund.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
yes
sir.
in
other
words,
all
the
legislative
history
shows.
it
says
that
it
should
not
be
union
money
but
if
money
is
given
for
a
special
purpose,
you
could
have
a
trust
fund
set
up
for
political
purposes.
you
can
do
anything
else.
i
am
sure
the
court
is
permitted
with
the
legislative
history.
we
set
it
out
at
great
length
in
our
brief.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
no,
no,
quite
a
little
bit
far
than
that,
a
little
far
than
that.
i
would
say
this,
that
the
crucial
thing
is
here,
that
these
people
adopted
to
do
anything
and
everything
the
legislative
history,
the
lawyers
and
as
well
as
three
judges
of
the
court
of
appeals
said
was
that
adequate
to
set
up
a
parallel
fund.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
that
is
right.
we
did
not
go
all
the
way
as
the
teamsters
are
doing
there.
we
took
precautions.
the
thing
that
--
the
thing
that
is
really
is
so
glad
out
here,
as
this
case
goes,
there
is
not
anything
that
these
people
did
that
was
a
violation
of
law.
you
could
take
all
the
acts
which
--
normally
they
give
all
the
instructions
and
there
are
all
things
which
are
set
out
that
you
can
do
by
setting
up
a
parallel
organization
that
you
can
have
the
business
agent
to
be
active
in
it.
you
can
have
the
stewards.
you
can
have
the
foreman.
you
can
have
everyone
else
be
active
in
it
and
still
they
go
on,
turn
this
on
and
attempt
to
make
this
a
violation,
make
this
a
violation
under
the
conspiracy.
now,
i
see
that
i
only
have
a
few
minutes
left
and
i
would
like
to
have
permission
to
have
some
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
one
minute.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
just
two
things.
one,
there
was
no
co-mingling
of
funds
and
two,
that
the
political
fund
was
given,
the
name
of
it
was
--
the
full
name
was
political,
educational,
legislative,
charity
and
defense
fund.
and
there
was
not
co-mingling.
i
invite
you
to
please
which
i
knew
you
will
read
the
instructions
particularly
those
that
are
given
in
our
brief
from
page
72
and
73
where
we
specifically
asked
the
instructions
which
would
have
fitted
in
in
line
with
the
position
that
they
have
taken
--
the
government
has
taken
now.
i
want
to
call
the
court’s
attention
that
the
government
did
not
take
this
position
at
the
trial
and
they
would
not
--
did
not
take
the
position
that
they
did
not
question
that
a
union
has
a
right
to
establish
a
political
organization
for
the
purpose
of
receiving
ear-marked
political
monies
directly
for
voluntary
contributions.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
well,
that
was
such
a
thing.
i
think
that
they
would
be
authorized
to
hire
a
person
to
attend
the
sessions
of
the
legislature
and
to
keep
advised
on
the
manner
on
which
the
legislature
of
missouri
as
well
as
in
other
states
where
in
their
people
may
be
doing
work
with
that.
they
would
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
laws
related
--
relating
to
all
matters.
in
other
words,
they
contributed
substantial
amount
in
excess,
i
believe
during
that
period
--
in
excess
of
a
$100,000.00
to
charity
during
that
period
and
kind
of
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
one
of
the
things
that
contribute
to
the
united
funds
for
instance
as
i
recall
i
do
not
remember
all
the
charities
that
contributed
to
various
hospitals
as
i
recall,
i
do
not
know
if
it
was
on
the
same
years
that
contributed
substantial
sums
to
the
(inaudible)
foundation.
they
contributed
money
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
no,
no,
these
which
i
mentioned
did
not.
all
these
charities
which
i
mentioned
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
union.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
no,
that
was
only
one
instance
as
i
recall
wherein
there
was
a
certain
contribution
made
towards
helping,
some
of
the
retirees
and
that
was,
i
do
not
recall
now
but
it
was
$10,000.00
out
of
some
practically
million
dollars.
there
was
no
co-mingling
of
funds
at
all.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
i
would
say
that
it
was
for
everybody’s
benefit
but
naturally
they
were
laboring
people
and
undoubtedly
they
were
interested
in
liberal
legislation,
legislation
which
would
be
good
not
necessarily
for
their
union
but
for
labor
generally.
they
were
constantly
supporting
liberal
candidates,
candidates
with
liberal
backgrounds
and
the
same
thing
on
legislation.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
an
indictment
that
was
returned
in
the
city
of
st.
louis
charging
a
labor
union,
local
562
--
pipefitters
union
local
number
562
and
three
individuals
that
conspire
to
make
unlawful
--
to
make
political
contributions
from
that
local.
the
indictment
in
the
case
alleged
that
a
political
fund
was
established
from
which
fund
contributions
would
be
made
and
the
indictment
stated
that
this
fund
was
the
fund
of
the
local
union.
there
was
no
allegation
in
the
indictment
that
the
contributions
were
made
involuntary
by
the
members
of
the
union
and
non-members
of
the
union
who
worked
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
union,
who
made
these
contributions.
and
the
indictment
alleges
that
as
part
of
that
scheme
or
artifacts
that
the
funds
were
collected
by
officers,
stewards,
members,
and
employees
of
the
fund
--
that
is
of
the
union
and
they
were
also
collecting
that
the
members
and
the
officers
of
the
union
were
collecting
for
the
fund.
pre-trial
motions
were
filed
and
in
the
pre-trial
motions,
it
was
alleged
that
the
indictment
was
attacked
on
the
ground
that
it
was
not
charged
that
the
contributions
were
made
involuntarily
on
the
ground
that
it
was
not
alleged
in
the
indictment
that
the
payments
were
union
dues
and
that
the
gist
of
the
pre-trial
motion
was
--
and
the
gist
was
that
this
was
really
a
parallel
political
fund
that
was
set
up
by
the
union
and
that
for
purpose
of
receiving
and
making
political
expenditures.
receiving
political
contributions
or
making
political
expenditures
and
we
contended
that
there
was
no
violation
shown
on
the
face
of
the
indictment.
a
bill
of
particulars
was
requested
but
instead
of
the
bill
of
particulars,
the
government
merely
filed
a
court
memorandum
and
in
that
memorandum,
the
government
stated
that
it
was
not
necessary
that
it
was
no
necessity
to
prove
that
the
funds
were
not
volunteered.
that
voluntariness
was
not
an
essence
of
the
crime
that
was
charged.
the
government's
theory
of
the
case
at
the
trial
was
that
they
submitted
an
instruction
and
that
instruction
which
was
set
up
in
appellants
and
petitioners’
brief
in
pages
12
and
13
lists
a
number
of
grounds.
the
original
10
grounds
which
are
listed
on
page
12
were
submitted
by
the
government
and
that
the
request
of
the
defendants’
additional
grounds
were
at
it
and
that
basis,
the
court
instructed
the
jury
and
gave
that
as
the
task
that
those
are
the
matters
which
the
jury
could
consider
whether
the
fund
was
in
fact
a
fund
of
the
union
or
rather
that
was
a
voluntary
political
fund.
that
was
established
by
the
union.
the
defendants’
requested
instructions
where
in
it
would
specifically
state
as
to
that
making
voluntary
payments
as
a
defense
and
the
court
said
in
the
instruction
however,
the
mere
fact
that
the
payments
into
the
fund
may
have
been
made
voluntary
by
some
or
even
all
of
the
contributors
thereto
does
not
of
itself.
the
court
said
it
means
that
the
monies
that
were
paid
into
the
fund
was
not
union
money
and
it
is
on
that
theory
on
which
the
case
was
tried.
the
defendants
also
submitted
two
instructions
which
i
will
refer
to
later.
they
submitted
many
instructions,
but
two
particular
instructions
which
we
thought
set
up
specifically
the
law
that
should
be
governed
in
accordance
with
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court.
but
the
court
refused
all
of
the
requested
instructions
from
the
defendants
and
the
only
ones
that
the
court
incorporated
were
those
which
are
set
out
in
the
footnote
on
page
20.
now
the
facts
were
as
follows.
but
first
let
me
say
this,
let
me
say
this.
the
jury
found
the
defendants
guilty
and
the
individuals
as
well
as
the
union?
the
union
was
fined
$5,000.00
and
each
defendant
was
sentenced
to
one
year
in
jail
and
a
punishment,
an
additional
fine
of
$1,000.00.
the
history
of
the
fund
is
this.
in
1949,
a
political
fund
was
established
by
this,
a
voluntary
political
fund
was
established
by
this
union
and
it
was
administered
independently
openly
and
notoriously
and
they
made
contributions
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
from
1949
on
until
the
date
of
the
conviction.
but
there
was
one
change
that
took
place
in
this
fund
in
1963.
the
union
negotiated
a
contract
with
the
employers
who
provided
for
a
check
off
system
and
when
they
provided
for
the
check
off
system,
they
consulted
with
their
lawyer,
a
very
prominent
labor
lawyer
in
the
st.
louis
who
has
devoted
most
of
his
lifetime
to
labor
law,
mr.
harry
craig
whose
name
is
mentioned
and
who
was
a
witness
in
the
case.
and
mr.
craig
at
that
time
suggested,
in
view
of
a
decision
that
was
in
the
law
that
prevailed
that
the
eastern
district
of
missouri.
it
was
a
case
wherein
the
teamsters
were
prosecuted
at
local
688
was
prosecuted
for
making
contributions
from
the
union
to
which
the
judge
sustained
a
motion
to
dismiss
after
the
evidence
was
in
on
the
ground
that
this
was
--
that
the
money
came
in
voluntarily
to
the
union.
mr.
craig
first
suggested
that
there
should
be
a
check
off
of
the
political
contributions
that
is
the
voluntary
political
contributions
in
the
same
manner
as
they
checked
off
the
other
monies
that
was
collected
by
the
union
but
it
would
be
paid
specifically
to
the
voluntary
political
fund.
after
a
while,
mr.
craig
changed
his
mind
and
provided
a
form
which
was
to
be
filled
out
by
each
of
the
members
that
wanted
to
contribute
to
the
political
fund
and
that
is
where
in
they
provided
and
stated
in
the
form
that
they
are
willing
to
make
voluntary
contributions.
they
are
willing
to
contribute
so
much
per
day’s
work
and
that
they
can
cancel
that
whenever
they
desire.
they
can
discontinue
giving
that
money
and
that
they
understood
it
is
voluntary
and
that
they
understood
specifically
that
this
money
is
being
given
for
political
and
other
purposes
to
be
administered
by
this
independent
fund.
after
that
was
done,
then
it
was
decided
to
continue
to
collect
the
money
in
the
same
manner
which
they
did
before.
that
is
the
foreman
or
the
stewards
on
the
job
continued
to
collect
the
money
and
send
it
in
to
this
political
organization,
that
is
to
this
voluntary
of
political,
charitable,
and
educational
fund.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
yes.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
no
sir,
this
was
a
complete
fund
--
a
fund
that
was
all
put
in
together
of
all
the
people
that
contributed
and
then
those
people
and
then
they
have
political
meetings
often
and
would
endorse
candidates
and
they
had
an
administrator
of
the
fund
who
could
act
as
he
sought
it
and
that
which
have
brought
powers
to
act.
but
an
answer
to
that
question,
i
might
tell
you,
that
it
so
happens
that
most
of
the
contributors
that
does
–-
well,
i
put
it
like
this,
all
the
witnesses
that
testified
were
testified
that
they
were
democrats
and
they
contributed
to
the
democratic
party
and
then
one
person
that
testified,
he
said
he
was
a
republican
and
that
he
did
not
contribute
to
the
fund.
that
was
one
of
the
witnesses
that
testified
so
that
--
that
question
would
answer
your
question
directly.
they
did
not
specify.
well,
they
could
stop
contributing
anytime
they
wanted.
of
the
evidence
that
was
offered,
the
government
introduced
12
stewards
and
foreman
who
collected
the
money.
some
of
those,
at
least
one
foreman
as
i
recall,
it
is
in
the
record
testified
that
even
though
he
collected
contributions,
he
himself
never
contributed.
they
also
testified
that
in
many
of
these
other
government
witnesses.
they
also
testified
that
in
many
instances,
when
some
people
did
not
contribute
that
he
called
and
asked
the
director
or
other
people
who
were
in
charge
of
the
fund
and
they
told
him
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
that
is
strictly
voluntary.
and
that
that
went
on
two
years.
and
additionally,
77
witnesses
testified
before
the
defendant
and
there
out
of
those
77,
32
testified
that
they
either
never
contributed
to
the
voluntary
political
fund
either
contributed
that
sometimes
and
not
contributed
at
other
times
or
contributed
whenever
they
felt
like
it
as
many
times
they
did
not
contribute.
the
testimony
also
shows
that
while
there
was
a
complete
record
kept
of
the
money
that
was
received
that
there
was
no
way
from
the
records
to
determine
if
anyone
paid
often
full
or
continuously
paid
or
whether
there
was
a
way
of
finding
out
from
the
records
if
a
person
was
delinquent
and
did
not
pay.
the
evidence
also
showed
that
no
effort
was
ever
made
to
get
people
to
pay
off
anything
that
may
have
been
delinquent
or
that
they
may
not
have
paid
in
accordance
with
their
written
instrument
wherein
they
agreed
to
contribute
to
the
voluntary
fund.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
i
do
not
recall
that.
it
does
not
show,
your
honor.
but
for
the
sake
of
discussion,
i
think
while
the
record
does
not
show
i
would
have
to
say
that
a
large
number
of
the
people
of
the
members
of
the
union
as
well
as
the
people
that
worked
under
the
jurisdiction
of
that
union
did
sign
that
agreement.
it
was
a
fund
that
was
administered,
that
had
separate
bank
accounts.
they
have
a
separate
name.
they
made
payments
out
of
that
fund
by
check.
it
was
audited.
there
was
--
no
discrepancies
were
found.
the
government
agents
had
the
(inaudible)
over
a
period
or
year,
in
fact
that
it
turned
them
to
us
just
before
the
trial
and
they
testified
they
could
find
no
shortages
of
any
kind.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
yes,
it
was
sometimes
in
connection
with
the
charitable
contributions.
substantial
amounts
were
used
in
connection
with
charitable
contributions.
on
one
occasion,
there
was
a
contribution
made
towards
some
payment
on
behalf
of
some
people
that
were
benefits.
it
was
not
in
the
union
benefits.
it
was
made
as
a
contribution.
they
also
invested
some
money
in
buying
a
place
in
clarksville,
missouri
which
is
about
approximately
60
miles
from
the
city
where
the
main
office
is
which
place
--
that
it
were
going
to
have
recreation
facilities
where
it
could
also
hold
political
meetings
and
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
no
sir.
no
sir,
it
was
a
facility
belonging
to
a
voluntary
fund.
voluntary
political
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
no
sir,
the
people
that
paid
into
the
fund
would
use
it.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
and
then
it
was
next
to
--
it
was
next
to
another
facility
that
was
helped
by
the
welfare
fund
of
the
said
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
well,
we
say
that
that
is
not
an
issue,
that
we
say
that
this
was
money
that
was
given
specifically
for
that
purpose.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
well,
we
are
not
challenging
it
that
way
unless,
unless
this
court
were
to
hold
--
unless
this
court
were
to
hold
that
we
are
not
permitted
to
do
what
we
did,
that
of
course,
we
would
challenge.
but
basically
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
let
us
put
it
like
this
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
we
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
the
law.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
not
in
so
many
words.
we
did
not
challenge
it
because
we
do
not
consider
that
dues
and
we
never
did
consider
that
dues.
in
other
words,
the
question
is
this?
we
did
not
consider
that
dues.
so
therefore,
we
did
not
challenge
the
law
on
that
manner.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
i
do
not
think
so.
we
did
not.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
we
asked
that
this
was
vague
and
indefinite
and
uncertain.
we
did
contend
that
that
the
law
was
vague
and
we
will
point
out
to
you
particularly
that
it
is
vague
insofar
in
the
manner
in
which
it
was
construed
by
the
lower
court
that
the
law
is
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
right.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
yes.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
that
is
exactly
our
contention,
that
this
is
not
a
contribution
by
a
labor
organization.
but
we
say
that
if
it
is
being
held
unconstitutional
--
if
it
is
being
held
unconstitutional,
in
other
words
if
the
interpretation
that
was
given
to
the
lower
court,
we
say
it
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
here.
but
we
are
not
challenging
it
at
this
point
because
we
are
really
not
concerned.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
well,
that
seems
to
be
the
understanding
accepting
in
our
district,
and
if
i
may
just
say
the
cause
of
good
faith
as
for
as
we
are
concerned,
that
is
important
in
this
case
and
that
is
why
i
am
going
to
say
that
because
we
do
not
have
to
advise
of
counsel
all
the
way
on
it.
and
that
is
just
that
we
did
have
a
case
where
a
union.
the
teamsters
union
local
5688
made
a
contribution
and
they
tried
them
and
the
court
sustained
a
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal
and
the
government
did
not
appeal
but
what
happened
there
was
this
where
they
did
as
the
following
that
members
were
able
to
designate
to
the
union
that
a
part,
a
certain
part
of
their
dues
shall
be
used
for
political
purposes.
in
other
words,
in
the
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
that
is
right.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
that
is
correct.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
that
is
correct.
a
parallel
organization
that
was
established
by
local
562
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
that
is
correct.
you
brought
me
right
to
the
very
important
question
that
we
have
here.
the
court
instructed
on
the
question
about
that
it
was
not
necessary
that
a
contribution
be
voluntary.
in
other
words,
we
say
that
it
did
not
make
any
difference
whether
the
contribution
was
voluntary
or
not
voluntary
but
at
a
trial
below
in
the
district
court
somehow
the
government
just
did
not
get
around
to
ever
say
that
it
was
perfectly
proper
to
have
a
parallel
organization
which
could
make
political
contribution
as
long
as
those
contributions
are
voluntarily
received
and
that
it
was
perfectly
alright
for
the
officers
and
the
agents
of
the
union
and
the
employees
of
the
union
to
participate
in
it.
now,
on
appeal,
for
the
first
time,
the
government
and
they
agreed
says
that
it
is
proper
to
have
such
an
organization
as
long
as
the
contributions
are
voluntary.
now
we
submit
that
the
least
we
should
have
that
is
that
question
determined
--
be
submitted
to
the
jury
to
determine
whether
the
contributions
were
or
were
not
voluntary.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
that
is
correct.
with
this
exception
and
as
i
say
you
do
not
have
to
reach
that.
you
do
not
have
to
reach
that
because
we
contend
that
this
was
not
a
contribution
by
a
labor
union.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
but
i
want
you
to
keep
in
mind
the
teamsters
case
and
say
look
which
was
the
law
in
our
district
at
that
time,
which
law
could
be
liable
where
it
said
that
if
it
is
a
voluntary
contribution
--
that
is
a
voluntary
contribution
to
the
union
that
the
union
could
pass
that
money
on.
but
we
do
not
have
to
reach
that
right
now.
we
are
not
concerned
with
that
because
we
contend
that
this
was
not
a
contribution
of
the
union.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
yes
sir.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
well,
the
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
we
have
an
office
next
door,
right
across
the
hall
from
the
union.
in
other
words
it
is
a
large
building
occupied
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
yes
sir
and
here
is
who
they
were.
they
were
local
562
had
jurisdiction
of
certain
large
jobs.
now
there
are
small
unions
in
the
areas
of
the
outside
of
missouri
who
are
not
equipped
to
handle
large
jobs.
so
local
562
would
have
jurisdiction
of
large
jobs
and
those
instances
some
of
the
employees
that
were
members
of
the
other
locals
would
come
and
work
on
these
jobs.
now
under
the
lehman
griffith
(ph)
originally
they
used
to
pay
$8.00
a
month
as
a
contribution
to
the
union.
under
the
lehman
griffin
(ph)
law,
mr.
craig,
the
union
attorney
said
that
it
would
be
some
question
that
if
they
are
permitted
to
pay
the
$8.00
per
month
that
therefore
they
would
have
to
be
permitted
to
join
later
the
union
and
which
would
make
this
local
entirely
too
big
and
they
would
not
be
justified
that
expenditure
rose
that
way.
so
for
that
reason,
they
abandoned
the
$8.00
completely,
but
the
people
that
worked
on
those
jobs
some
of
them
did
contribute
to
the
political
fund.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
not
all,
they
receive
more
than
that.
they
contribute
as
much
as
$2.00
a
day.
in
other
words,
they
contributed
and
started
off
at
a
dollar
a
day
and
it
finally
went
to
$2.00
a
day.
but
it
was
all
voluntary
and
the
evidence
showed
that
many
of
them
testified
that
they
did
not
--
many
of
them
did
not
contribute
at
all
as
they
did
not
affect
their
job.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
that
is
where
you
finally
wind
up
being
tried.
we
did
not
know
what
was
being
tried
to
be
perfectly
frank
about
it.
but
we
finally
wound
up
that
that
is
what
was
being
tried.
that
was
tried
that
this
was
a
shame
in
the
scheme
to
put
a
union
to
make
political
contributions.
now
the
reason
that
was
voluntariness
was
important
because
if
the
people
made
the
contributions
voluntarily,
why
would
they
make
that
contribution
if
the
union
was
to
put
him
on
pressure
unless
it
was
voluntarily.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
i
think
that
is
correct.
that
was
an
attempt
made
to
do
it
in
that
way.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
that
is
being
thrust
that
the
instructions
to
the
jury
and
if
you
will
look
at
pages
72
and
73
of
the
defendants’
briefs
and
which
were
the
instructions
that
we
requested,
there
are
many
others
but
two
of
them
particular
there
and
if
i
could
just
take
one
second
to
read
of
them
at
least
where
that
is
on
page
72
where
we
said,
the
court
instructs
the
jury
that
the
law
permits
labor
union
members
to
set
up
a
fund
or
organization
for
the
collection
of
money
to
be
used
for
making
contributions
to
candidates
for
federal
political
office.
the
law
merely
prohibits
labor
union
money
from
being
used
for
such
purpose.
therefore,
if
you
find
that
contributions
made
to
the
political,
educational,
legislative,
charity
and
defense
fund
were
made
by
members
of
local
562
voluntarily
and
did
not
constitute
the
payment
of
union
dues
or
labor
union
money,
you
must
find
the
defendants
not
guilty.
now
the
court
refused,
they
gave
these
instructions
in
various
ways
and
the
court
refused
this
particular
instruction
in
every
way.
now,
it
was
not
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
yes.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
yes.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
if
those
contributions
are
made
voluntary.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
only
if
they
are
made
voluntary.
in
other
words,
and
secondly
we
would
say
that
it
is
vague
that
it
does
not
spell
out
just
what
you
can
and
what
you
cannot
do.
and
that
it
is
restrictive
as
far
as
the
first
amendment
is
concerned.
but
now
the
point
that
we
pointed
out,
that
was
a
complete
like
getting
back
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
yes
sir.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
i
would
say
certainly
the
way
they
handled
the
teamsters
case
in
st.
louis
that
it
does
permit
it.
in
other
words,
it
would
automatically
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
now,
i
would
say
it
does.
it
would
automatically
become
a
special
fund.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
yes
sir.
in
other
words,
all
the
legislative
history
shows.
it
says
that
it
should
not
be
union
money
but
if
money
is
given
for
a
special
purpose,
you
could
have
a
trust
fund
set
up
for
political
purposes.
you
can
do
anything
else.
i
am
sure
the
court
is
permitted
with
the
legislative
history.
we
set
it
out
at
great
length
in
our
brief.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
no,
no,
quite
a
little
bit
far
than
that,
a
little
far
than
that.
i
would
say
this,
that
the
crucial
thing
is
here,
that
these
people
adopted
to
do
anything
and
everything
the
legislative
history,
the
lawyers
and
as
well
as
three
judges
of
the
court
of
appeals
said
was
that
adequate
to
set
up
a
parallel
fund.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
that
is
right.
we
did
not
go
all
the
way
as
the
teamsters
are
doing
there.
we
took
precautions.
the
thing
that
--
the
thing
that
is
really
is
so
glad
out
here,
as
this
case
goes,
there
is
not
anything
that
these
people
did
that
was
a
violation
of
law.
you
could
take
all
the
acts
which
--
normally
they
give
all
the
instructions
and
there
are
all
things
which
are
set
out
that
you
can
do
by
setting
up
a
parallel
organization
that
you
can
have
the
business
agent
to
be
active
in
it.
you
can
have
the
stewards.
you
can
have
the
foreman.
you
can
have
everyone
else
be
active
in
it
and
still
they
go
on,
turn
this
on
and
attempt
to
make
this
a
violation,
make
this
a
violation
under
the
conspiracy.
now,
i
see
that
i
only
have
a
few
minutes
left
and
i
would
like
to
have
permission
to
have
some
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
one
minute.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
just
two
things.
one,
there
was
no
co-mingling
of
funds
and
two,
that
the
political
fund
was
given,
the
name
of
it
was
--
the
full
name
was
political,
educational,
legislative,
charity
and
defense
fund.
and
there
was
not
co-mingling.
i
invite
you
to
please
which
i
knew
you
will
read
the
instructions
particularly
those
that
are
given
in
our
brief
from
page
72
and
73
where
we
specifically
asked
the
instructions
which
would
have
fitted
in
in
line
with
the
position
that
they
have
taken
--
the
government
has
taken
now.
i
want
to
call
the
court’s
attention
that
the
government
did
not
take
this
position
at
the
trial
and
they
would
not
--
did
not
take
the
position
that
they
did
not
question
that
a
union
has
a
right
to
establish
a
political
organization
for
the
purpose
of
receiving
ear-marked
political
monies
directly
for
voluntary
contributions.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
well,
that
was
such
a
thing.
i
think
that
they
would
be
authorized
to
hire
a
person
to
attend
the
sessions
of
the
legislature
and
to
keep
advised
on
the
manner
on
which
the
legislature
of
missouri
as
well
as
in
other
states
where
in
their
people
may
be
doing
work
with
that.
they
would
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
laws
related
--
relating
to
all
matters.
in
other
words,
they
contributed
substantial
amount
in
excess,
i
believe
during
that
period
--
in
excess
of
a
$100,000.00
to
charity
during
that
period
and
kind
of
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
one
of
the
things
that
contribute
to
the
united
funds
for
instance
as
i
recall
i
do
not
remember
all
the
charities
that
contributed
to
various
hospitals
as
i
recall,
i
do
not
know
if
it
was
on
the
same
years
that
contributed
substantial
sums
to
the
(inaudible)
foundation.
they
contributed
money
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
no,
no,
these
which
i
mentioned
did
not.
all
these
charities
which
i
mentioned
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
union.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
no,
that
was
only
one
instance
as
i
recall
wherein
there
was
a
certain
contribution
made
towards
helping,
some
of
the
retirees
and
that
was,
i
do
not
recall
now
but
it
was
$10,000.00
out
of
some
practically
million
dollars.
there
was
no
co-mingling
of
funds
at
all.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
i
would
say
that
it
was
for
everybody’s
benefit
but
naturally
they
were
laboring
people
and
undoubtedly
they
were
interested
in
liberal
legislation,
legislation
which
would
be
good
not
necessarily
for
their
union
but
for
labor
generally.
they
were
constantly
supporting
liberal
candidates,
candidates
with
liberal
backgrounds
and
the
same
thing
on
legislation.
