mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
since
1907,
congress
has
prohibited
corporations
and
national
banks
from
making
contributions
to
certain
political
campaigns.
this
legislation
has
been
changed
over
the
years
in
the
history
has
recounted
in
previous
opinions
of
this
court
between
the
auto
workers
case
in
volume
353
u.s.
in
1943,
congress
first
extended
the
same
prohibitions
to
labor
unions
on
a
temporary
wartime
basis
and
then
25
years
ago
in
1947,
this
prohibition
against
unions
and
against
corporations,
the
same
prohibition
was
made
permanent
in
the
statute
under
which
the
present
prosecution
was
brought.
the
legislative
history
of
these
provisions
which
has
also
been
recounted
in
previous
opinions
shows
a
dual
congressional
purpose
(a)
to
protect
the
electoral
process
from
undue
influence
which
in
some
instances
congress
believed
threatened
the
very
integrity
and
the
representative
character
of
the
elections
and
(b)
to
protect
the
individual
stockholders
and
individual
union
members
from
having
their
funds
used
to
support
political
causes
they
might
disagree
with
or
that
they
might
prefer
not
to
support
financially.
and
it
seems
to
us
not
to
be
coincidental
that
the
extension
of
these
prohibitions
to
unions
followed
upon
the
protective
legislation
of
the
preceding
decade
such
as
the
national
labor
relations
act,
norris-laguardia
act.
the
result
of
that
legislation
like
corporations,
unions
that
became
aggregations
of
economic
power
fostered
an
important
way
by
government
through
the
granting
of
special
legal
status
and
special
prerogatives,
legal
powers
which
might
induce
individuals
to
pull
their
economic
resources
in
these
organizations.
and
the
congressional
concern
that
is
manifested
through
the
legislative
history
was
the
payments
made
by
individuals
to
these
organizations
for
reasons
other
than
a
desire
to
support
particular
candidates
for
public
office
might
be
diverted
to
that
use.
congress
sought
to
assure
through
this
legislation
that
when
individuals
join
together
for
the
purpose
of
supporting
political
campaigns,
it
will
be
done
truly
of
their
own
volition.
it
will
be
a
matter
of
their
own
deliberate
choice
and
not
something
that
results
from
the
power
of
organizations
being
applied
to
them.
now
in
the
present
case,
unlike
the
preceding
ones
in
which
this
court
has
considered
the
statute,
disbursements
from
the
pipefitters
fund
were
made
directly
to
federal
political
candidates.
so
that
is
true
in
the
sum
of
almost
$100,000.00
in
the
1964
election
and
almost
$50,000.00
in
the
1966
election
which
are
the
only
two
federal
elections
during
the
indictment
period.
the
indictment
was
in
the
spring
of
1968.
and
there
is
no
question
about
what
these
are
contributions
or
expenditures
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
the
entire
issue
is
whether
these
contributions
or
expenditures
were
made
by
the
union
for
purposes
of
applying
the
statute.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
do
not
think
the
statute
requires
that.
i
think
that
the
facts
here
permitted
the
word
to
be
put
in
at
the
issue
involved
in
this
case
shown
by
the
evidence
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
felt
that
need
not
in
this
case
take
on
that
case
and
we
are
not
arguing
in
this
case
that
the
union
could
never
be
the
conduit
for
if
you
want
to
call
them
voluntary
contributions
that
are
made
through
a
truly
voluntary
association.
i
mean
much
of
the
difficulty
in
the
discussion
here
and
in
the
argument
is
because
the
word
voluntary
is
such
an
imprecise
word.
we
mentioned
this
in
our
brief.
there
is
a
great
difference
between
consenting,
doing
what
you
are
told
to
do
without
protest.
that
kind
of
voluntariness
and
what
we
think
congress
was
trying
to
assure
would
be
the
freedom
of
choice
that
individuals
would
have
in
choosing
to
associate
together
politically
and
make
contributions
to
political
campaign
which
would
be
more
element
of
their
own
free
deliberate
choice
that
this
is
what
they
desire
to
do
rather
than
merely
the
kind
of
consent
that
we
think
the
evidence
in
this
case
pointed
to
in
a
repeated
testimony
of
many
individuals
that
their
contributions
were
voluntary.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
was
refused.
i
think
it
was
properly
refused
considering
the
way
the
term
voluntary
had
been
used
throughout
that
file.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
under
the
statute,
mere
consent
of
the
kind
involved
here
that
the
use
of
the
word
“voluntary”
implied
throughout
this
trial
is
not
a
defense
to
be
used
by
a
corporation
of
its
monies
for
political
campaigns
in
the
use
by
union
of
its
money.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
do
you
think
the
instructions
were
entirely
proper?
we
also
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
acted
properly
in
holding
that
a
deliberate
choice
had
been
made
on
appeal
not
to
preserve
objections
of
the
instructions
and
that
it
was
within
the
priority
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
refuse
to
pass
on
that
issue?
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
believe
that
this
court
sitting
as
a
court,
should
uphold
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
on
that
but
we
also
stand
out
in
the
instructions.
we
think
that
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
these
instructions
in
the
context
of
this
case
and
whether
defending
on
both
grounds
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
now
this
statute
is
about
contributions
by
the
union
of
the
union
funds
that
that
is
what
congress
sought
to
reach
here.
well,
that
is
why
i
was
trying
to
get
to
that?
just
where
does
the
union
contribute
to
funds
here?
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
that
we
believe
was
the
question
put
to
the
jury.
as
with
any
statute
of
this
type,
the
question
is
whether
the
fact
show
what
the
statute
makes
unlawful
happen
here
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
do
not
see
that
the
record
really
establishes
exactly
how
many
contributed
to
the
fund.
there
are
indications
in
the
record
that
the
parties
were
acting
as
if
the
great
majority
practically
all
of
them
contributed
to
the
fund.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
was
the
theory
of
our
case
throughout.
i
think
it
was
set
forth
very
clearly
in
the
indictment.
it
is
on
page
14
of
the
appendix
paragraph
10
of
the
indictment
presents
the
case
under
that
theory.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
this
was
the
device
being
used
by
the
union
to
make
contributions
of
the
union
funds
to
political
campaign.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
do
not
believe
so.
that
is
exactly
the
issue
that
was
put
to
the
jury.
we
have
reproduced
the
pertinent
portion
of
the
instructions
to
the
jury
in
our
brief
and
if
your
honors
want
to
turn
to
page
17
of
our
brief,
the
paragraph
in
the
middle
of
that
page
put
that
precise
issue
to
the
jury.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
what
the
jury
was
asked
to
decide
and
if
you
do
not
mind,
i
will
just
very
quickly
read
through
that
paragraph.
in
this
case
the
evidence
was
offered
by
the
government
to
the
effect
that
funds
were
contributed
to
or
on
behalf
of
candidates
for
federal
office
and
that
such
funds
were
paid
out
upon
checks
drawn
upon
pipefitters
fund,
i
will
call
it.
it
is
necessary
therefore
that
the
evidence
established
that
the
pipefitters
fund
was
in
fact
a
union
fund
that
the
money
there
in
was
union
money
and
that
the
real
contributor
to
the
candidates
was
the
union.
as
to
this
issue,
the
defendants
contend
that
the
fund
in
question
was
a
bona
fide
entity
separate
and
apart
from
the
union
established
by
the
voluntary
good
faith
act
of
members
of
pipefitters
local
562
and
others
from
which
contributions
to
candidates
were
made
on
behalf
of
the
persons
who
created
the
fund
and
not
on
behalf
of
the
union.
on
the
other
hand,
the
government
contend
that
the
fund
was
a
mere
artificer
device
set
up
by
the
defendants
and
others
as
a
part
of
the
alleged
conspiracy
to
give
the
outward
appearance
of
being
an
independent
and
separate
entity
but
in
fact
constituting
a
part
of
union
funds.
and
much
should
be
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
explaining
that
one,
with
that
19
factors
listed
which
the
jury
should
take
into
account
in
answering
the
question.
but
the
question
is
put;
i
think
most
succinctly
in
this
paragraph
and
much
of
the
argument
in
the
briefs
on
the
other
side
and
in
the
oral
argument
on
the
other
side
seems
to
be
based
on
the
premise
that
the
jury
decided
this
issue
of
fact
in
favor
of
the
defendants.
but
of
course,
the
verdict
indicates
that
the
factual
issue
was
decided
in
support
of
the
government’s
theory
of
the
case,
that
the
fund
was
an
artificer
device
through
which
the
union
was
making
contributions
of
the
union
money.
and
we
think
there
is
ample
evidence
in
the
case
to
support
this
factual
determination
by
the
jury.
i
would
like
to
briefly
recount
some
of
that
evidence
to
the
court.
in
the
first
place,
local
562
had
jurisdiction
over
all
the
major
jobs
in
more
than
half
of
the
state
of
missouri
and
contractors
in
this
area
had
to
get
their
pipefitters
for
major
jobs
from
local
562
during
this
period
even
though
there
were
three
other
locals
located
in
the
area
whose
members
regularly
worked
on
jobs
under
562’s
jurisdiction.
those
jobs
paid
more
than
the
jobs
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
other
local
and
the
principle
operating
revenues
of
this
local
came
from
assessments
imposed
as
fixed
sums
per
day
worked
on
each
member
of
this
local
or
each
out
of
town.
they
are
working
under
the
local’s
jurisdiction
in
the
pre-indictment
period
and
smaller
monthly
dues
were
paid
by
the
members
which
were
passed
through
the
international
and
large
part.
the
fund
involved
here,
the
pipefitters
fund
was
began
in
1949
and
at
first,
the
assessments
for
the
fund
and
for
the
union
dues
were
made
to
gather
and
exactly
the
same
way
and
applied
and
exactly
the
same
way
to
both
the
members
of
the
local
and
the
out-of-towner.
the
first
25
cents
per
day
was
paid
by
each
man
as
a
union
assessment
and
25
cents
per
day
to
the
fund.
later
it
was
50
cents
per
day
to
each
and
starting
in
january
1963,
which
is
the
indictment
period,
the
local
stopped
collecting
assessments
from
the
non-members
but
a
pattern
was
established
whereby
each
of
these
non-members
would
contribute
to
the
fund
at
the
same
rate
as
the
total
of
the
daily
contribution
of
a
member
of
the
local
to
the
fund
and
added
to
his
assessment
to
the
union.
and
these
were
still
being
treated
for
all
practical
purposes
collected
in
a
manner
that
they
have
previously
been
collected
as
assessments.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
was
evidence
that
they
did
not
question
about
the
contribution
with
an
obligation
that
they
had
to
the
union.
there
were
some
individual
testimony
that
after
failing
to
contribute,
the
man
was
not
hired
after
that
week
again.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
these
were
out-of-towners.
but
we
do
not
rely
on
that
testimony
alone
because
most
of
the
evidence,
it
seems
to
us
indicates
that
both
the
union
leadership
and
the
members
and
the
out-of-towners
considered
this
just
part
of
their
regular
obligations
to
the
union
that
would
be
regularly
paid
and
indeed
were
regularly
paid.
and
at
one
point,
the
union’s
executive
board
conveyed
this
impression
of
the
membership
quite
clearly.
this
is
recounted
at
page
11
of
our
brief.
in
the
middle
of
page
11,
at
the
time
that
there
was
a
50
cent
increase
in
the
assessment,
the
daily
assessment
of
union
members.
the
executive
board
minutes
distributed
to
the
members
explicitly
tied
this
to
a
50
cent
decrease
in
the
contributions
of
the
fund
that
would
then
be
expected
of
the
members
of
the
local.
and
the
quotation
from
the
minutes
distributed
to
the
members
was
we
believe
when
the
details
are
explained
to
all
of
you.
all
will
agree
as
we
do
on
this
matter
because
this
will
not
be
one
extra
penny
cost
to
members
of
local
union
562.
the
whole
assumption
is
that
every
member
pays
the
prescribed
contribution
to
the
fund.
and
therefore
because
the
union
treasury
needed
more
money
and
adjustment
would
be
made,
50
cents
more
to
the
treasury,
50
cents
less
to
the
fund
for
internal
bookkeeping
purposes.
it
would
not
affect
the
financial
obligations
of
the
members
at
all.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
but
that
instruction
was
given
in
the
context
of
the
entire
instruction
here
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
what
we
are
really
saying
is
that
the
basic
question
put
to
the
jury
was
were
this
really
union
monies
that
have
been
collected
in
the
manner
that
union
monies
are
collected
or
paid
in
as
union
monies?
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
think
that
is
not
the
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
now
that
is
--
you
see
that
is
where
i
stopped.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
the
contribution
was
not
made
for
political
purposes,
the
instructions
were
even
if
these
were
voluntary
contributions
if
they
were
union
monies,
they
were
being
used
illegally
under
the
statute.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
right.
and
not
political
money,
not
funds
that
were
voluntarily
being
contributed
for
the
purpose
of
supporting
political
causes
but
assessments
that
were
being
made
as
part
of
their
obligations
to
the
union.
what
congress
was
concerned
about
was
that
the
economic
power
of
the
organization
would
be
brought
to
bear
to
get
money
with
people
who
are
really
giving
for
other
reasons.
and
use
that
money
--
and
that
money
would
be
used
by
the
organization
for
political
purposes.
the
issue
put
to
the
jury
was,
was
this
really
money
being
given
by
these
individuals
to
the
union
for
union
purposes
because
they
wanted
to
support
the
union
or
thought
that
they
were
obligated
to
support
the
union
even
though
they
were
voluntarily
doing
it
in
the
sense
they
consented
to
make
the
payments
that
were
asked
of
them.
nonetheless,
the
question
of
the
jury
decided
was
that
these
union
monies
were
not
separate
monies
for
a
political
purposes
that
were
intended
to
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
voluntary.
justice,
the
assessments
are
voluntarily
paid
when
you
are
asked
to
pay
your
union
assessment,
you
pay
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
right.
but
it
was
used
over
and
over
again
in
the
testimony
by
people
who
said
that
they
paid
what
they
were
asked
to
voluntarily.
and
this
portion
of
the
instructions
starts
off
a
great
deal
of
evidence
has
been
introduced
and
whether
the
payments
were
voluntary
and
this
is
relevant
but
not
the
total
answer
of
the
question
the
judge
said.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
the
instruction
was
clear
on
that.
i
see
the
whole
trial
is
based
on
the
question
of
whether
this
was
a
bona
fide
political
fund
where
people
were
making
contributions
for
political
purposes.
or
whether,
they
were
really
paying
obligations
that
they
thought
they
had
to
pay
to
the
union
because
of
the
union’s
economic
power.
this
was
the
whole
theory
of
the
case
and
much
of
the
testimony
looked
in
this
direction.
i
would
like
if
may
to
refer
your
honors
to
the
testimony
of
one
man
who
was
an
out-of-towner
working
in
this
jurisdiction
which
is
in
volume
2
of
the
record
on
page
757.
the
cross-examination
begins,
sir,
your
testimony
is
that
you
got
from
$30.00
to
$40.00
more
per
week
when
you
are
working
on
a
st.
louis
job?
answer:
yes,
approximately.
the
question
is,
that
is
why
you
are
willing
to
pay
this
$10.00
a
week
into
the
fund?
answer:
yes.
and
then
after
some
intervening
questioning
on
page
759,
the
witness
says
it
is
to
my
interest
to
pay
the
voluntary
donation
because
the
wages
are
better
under
the
st.
louis
scale
than
they
are
in
the
case
of
gerardo’s
scale.
question:
yes
sir
and
it
is
a
good
deal
for
you
to
pay
$10.00
a
week
in
order
to
get
$30.00
to
$40.00
more
pay
a
week
out
of
that
job?
the
answer,
yes.
that
is
the
type
of
deal
that
you
are
saying
is
better
for
you?
yes.
and
then
the
question
and
except
for
that
you
would
not
be
voluntarily
paying
anything
would
you?
answer:
no.
now,
in
the
context
of
a
trial
in
which
voluntary
payments
was
used
in
that
manner
that
this
instruction
was
made
and
i
think
if
you
read
it
as
part
of
the
entire
instruction,
the
theory
of
the
case
follows
through
from
the
indictment
right
through
the
instructions
and
it
seems
to
us
implements
this
longstanding
congressional
purpose.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
record
does
indicate
that
strike
benefits
were
paid
and
that
the
money
was
also
used
to
purchase
this
retirement
or
recreation
center.
it
was
also
a
time
when
the
gift
fund
for
petitioner
callanan
was
now
deceased,
was
substituted
for
the
political
fund.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
payments?
yes
sir.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
all
we
have
is
a
record
and
accountant’s
record
of
disbursement
from
the
fund,
there
is
not
much
in
the
way
of
indication
of
how
the
funds
were
handled.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
disbursements
from
the
fund?
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
what
the
jury
decided
was
that
those
were
payments
really
made
by
the
union
and
that
is
what
the
statute
prevails.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
is
just
an
indication
that
the
leadership
of
the
union
treated
this
money
as
available
to
them
not
merely
for
political
expenditures
but
for
any
union
purposes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
including
political
expenditures.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
quite
so,
your
honor.
i
did
not
mean
to
say
that
the
statute
would
permit
the
union
to
make
political
contributions
in
a
situation
where
voluntary
contributions
were
being
made
to
the
union.
i
do
think
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
even
though
they
were
voluntarily
made
for
political
purposes.
it
will
be
a
different
case
from
this
one
and
i
think
a
more
difficult
case.
well,
we
believe
that
in
light
of
the
instructions
given
and
the
testimony
before
the
verdict
here,
properly
applied
the
statute
to
these
facts.
it
was
a
complicated
factor
determination
that
that
does
not
mean
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutionally
vague.
it
was
the
kind
of
actual
determination
that
often
has
to
be
made
in
cases
under
the
sherman
act
or
in
criminal
fraud
cases
involving
complex
business
transactions
where
factual
judgment
has
to
be
made
as
to
the
substance
of
the
transaction
that
was
placed
before
the
jury.
your
honor,
in
light
of
the
purposes,
congress
had
in
mind,
does
the
statute
reach
too
broadly
here,
because
i
think
the
evidence
in
this
case
shows
quite
persuasively,
that
it
was
a
reasonable
judgment
for
congress
to
make
that
no
lesser
measure
would
adequately
protect
individual
members
from
having
the
economic
power
of
these
organizations
brought
to
bear
upon
them
in
ways
that
would
cause
their
funds
to
exactly
to
support
political
causes
when
their
preference
might
really
be
not
to
support
those
cause
or
any
cause.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
since
1907,
congress
has
prohibited
corporations
and
national
banks
from
making
contributions
to
certain
political
campaigns.
this
legislation
has
been
changed
over
the
years
in
the
history
has
recounted
in
previous
opinions
of
this
court
between
the
auto
workers
case
in
volume
353
u.s.
in
1943,
congress
first
extended
the
same
prohibitions
to
labor
unions
on
a
temporary
wartime
basis
and
then
25
years
ago
in
1947,
this
prohibition
against
unions
and
against
corporations,
the
same
prohibition
was
made
permanent
in
the
statute
under
which
the
present
prosecution
was
brought.
the
legislative
history
of
these
provisions
which
has
also
been
recounted
in
previous
opinions
shows
a
dual
congressional
purpose
(a)
to
protect
the
electoral
process
from
undue
influence
which
in
some
instances
congress
believed
threatened
the
very
integrity
and
the
representative
character
of
the
elections
and
(b)
to
protect
the
individual
stockholders
and
individual
union
members
from
having
their
funds
used
to
support
political
causes
they
might
disagree
with
or
that
they
might
prefer
not
to
support
financially.
and
it
seems
to
us
not
to
be
coincidental
that
the
extension
of
these
prohibitions
to
unions
followed
upon
the
protective
legislation
of
the
preceding
decade
such
as
the
national
labor
relations
act,
norris-laguardia
act.
the
result
of
that
legislation
like
corporations,
unions
that
became
aggregations
of
economic
power
fostered
an
important
way
by
government
through
the
granting
of
special
legal
status
and
special
prerogatives,
legal
powers
which
might
induce
individuals
to
pull
their
economic
resources
in
these
organizations.
and
the
congressional
concern
that
is
manifested
through
the
legislative
history
was
the
payments
made
by
individuals
to
these
organizations
for
reasons
other
than
a
desire
to
support
particular
candidates
for
public
office
might
be
diverted
to
that
use.
congress
sought
to
assure
through
this
legislation
that
when
individuals
join
together
for
the
purpose
of
supporting
political
campaigns,
it
will
be
done
truly
of
their
own
volition.
it
will
be
a
matter
of
their
own
deliberate
choice
and
not
something
that
results
from
the
power
of
organizations
being
applied
to
them.
now
in
the
present
case,
unlike
the
preceding
ones
in
which
this
court
has
considered
the
statute,
disbursements
from
the
pipefitters
fund
were
made
directly
to
federal
political
candidates.
so
that
is
true
in
the
sum
of
almost
$100,000.00
in
the
1964
election
and
almost
$50,000.00
in
the
1966
election
which
are
the
only
two
federal
elections
during
the
indictment
period.
the
indictment
was
in
the
spring
of
1968.
and
there
is
no
question
about
what
these
are
contributions
or
expenditures
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
the
entire
issue
is
whether
these
contributions
or
expenditures
were
made
by
the
union
for
purposes
of
applying
the
statute.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
do
not
think
the
statute
requires
that.
i
think
that
the
facts
here
permitted
the
word
to
be
put
in
at
the
issue
involved
in
this
case
shown
by
the
evidence
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
felt
that
need
not
in
this
case
take
on
that
case
and
we
are
not
arguing
in
this
case
that
the
union
could
never
be
the
conduit
for
if
you
want
to
call
them
voluntary
contributions
that
are
made
through
a
truly
voluntary
association.
i
mean
much
of
the
difficulty
in
the
discussion
here
and
in
the
argument
is
because
the
word
voluntary
is
such
an
imprecise
word.
we
mentioned
this
in
our
brief.
there
is
a
great
difference
between
consenting,
doing
what
you
are
told
to
do
without
protest.
that
kind
of
voluntariness
and
what
we
think
congress
was
trying
to
assure
would
be
the
freedom
of
choice
that
individuals
would
have
in
choosing
to
associate
together
politically
and
make
contributions
to
political
campaign
which
would
be
more
element
of
their
own
free
deliberate
choice
that
this
is
what
they
desire
to
do
rather
than
merely
the
kind
of
consent
that
we
think
the
evidence
in
this
case
pointed
to
in
a
repeated
testimony
of
many
individuals
that
their
contributions
were
voluntary.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
was
refused.
i
think
it
was
properly
refused
considering
the
way
the
term
voluntary
had
been
used
throughout
that
file.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
under
the
statute,
mere
consent
of
the
kind
involved
here
that
the
use
of
the
word
“voluntary”
implied
throughout
this
trial
is
not
a
defense
to
be
used
by
a
corporation
of
its
monies
for
political
campaigns
in
the
use
by
union
of
its
money.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
do
you
think
the
instructions
were
entirely
proper?
we
also
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
acted
properly
in
holding
that
a
deliberate
choice
had
been
made
on
appeal
not
to
preserve
objections
of
the
instructions
and
that
it
was
within
the
priority
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
refuse
to
pass
on
that
issue?
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
believe
that
this
court
sitting
as
a
court,
should
uphold
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
on
that
but
we
also
stand
out
in
the
instructions.
we
think
that
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
these
instructions
in
the
context
of
this
case
and
whether
defending
on
both
grounds
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
now
this
statute
is
about
contributions
by
the
union
of
the
union
funds
that
that
is
what
congress
sought
to
reach
here.
well,
that
is
why
i
was
trying
to
get
to
that?
just
where
does
the
union
contribute
to
funds
here?
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
that
we
believe
was
the
question
put
to
the
jury.
as
with
any
statute
of
this
type,
the
question
is
whether
the
fact
show
what
the
statute
makes
unlawful
happen
here
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
do
not
see
that
the
record
really
establishes
exactly
how
many
contributed
to
the
fund.
there
are
indications
in
the
record
that
the
parties
were
acting
as
if
the
great
majority
practically
all
of
them
contributed
to
the
fund.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
was
the
theory
of
our
case
throughout.
i
think
it
was
set
forth
very
clearly
in
the
indictment.
it
is
on
page
14
of
the
appendix
paragraph
10
of
the
indictment
presents
the
case
under
that
theory.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
this
was
the
device
being
used
by
the
union
to
make
contributions
of
the
union
funds
to
political
campaign.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
do
not
believe
so.
that
is
exactly
the
issue
that
was
put
to
the
jury.
we
have
reproduced
the
pertinent
portion
of
the
instructions
to
the
jury
in
our
brief
and
if
your
honors
want
to
turn
to
page
17
of
our
brief,
the
paragraph
in
the
middle
of
that
page
put
that
precise
issue
to
the
jury.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
what
the
jury
was
asked
to
decide
and
if
you
do
not
mind,
i
will
just
very
quickly
read
through
that
paragraph.
in
this
case
the
evidence
was
offered
by
the
government
to
the
effect
that
funds
were
contributed
to
or
on
behalf
of
candidates
for
federal
office
and
that
such
funds
were
paid
out
upon
checks
drawn
upon
pipefitters
fund,
i
will
call
it.
it
is
necessary
therefore
that
the
evidence
established
that
the
pipefitters
fund
was
in
fact
a
union
fund
that
the
money
there
in
was
union
money
and
that
the
real
contributor
to
the
candidates
was
the
union.
as
to
this
issue,
the
defendants
contend
that
the
fund
in
question
was
a
bona
fide
entity
separate
and
apart
from
the
union
established
by
the
voluntary
good
faith
act
of
members
of
pipefitters
local
562
and
others
from
which
contributions
to
candidates
were
made
on
behalf
of
the
persons
who
created
the
fund
and
not
on
behalf
of
the
union.
on
the
other
hand,
the
government
contend
that
the
fund
was
a
mere
artificer
device
set
up
by
the
defendants
and
others
as
a
part
of
the
alleged
conspiracy
to
give
the
outward
appearance
of
being
an
independent
and
separate
entity
but
in
fact
constituting
a
part
of
union
funds.
and
much
should
be
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
explaining
that
one,
with
that
19
factors
listed
which
the
jury
should
take
into
account
in
answering
the
question.
but
the
question
is
put;
i
think
most
succinctly
in
this
paragraph
and
much
of
the
argument
in
the
briefs
on
the
other
side
and
in
the
oral
argument
on
the
other
side
seems
to
be
based
on
the
premise
that
the
jury
decided
this
issue
of
fact
in
favor
of
the
defendants.
but
of
course,
the
verdict
indicates
that
the
factual
issue
was
decided
in
support
of
the
government’s
theory
of
the
case,
that
the
fund
was
an
artificer
device
through
which
the
union
was
making
contributions
of
the
union
money.
and
we
think
there
is
ample
evidence
in
the
case
to
support
this
factual
determination
by
the
jury.
i
would
like
to
briefly
recount
some
of
that
evidence
to
the
court.
in
the
first
place,
local
562
had
jurisdiction
over
all
the
major
jobs
in
more
than
half
of
the
state
of
missouri
and
contractors
in
this
area
had
to
get
their
pipefitters
for
major
jobs
from
local
562
during
this
period
even
though
there
were
three
other
locals
located
in
the
area
whose
members
regularly
worked
on
jobs
under
562’s
jurisdiction.
those
jobs
paid
more
than
the
jobs
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
other
local
and
the
principle
operating
revenues
of
this
local
came
from
assessments
imposed
as
fixed
sums
per
day
worked
on
each
member
of
this
local
or
each
out
of
town.
they
are
working
under
the
local’s
jurisdiction
in
the
pre-indictment
period
and
smaller
monthly
dues
were
paid
by
the
members
which
were
passed
through
the
international
and
large
part.
the
fund
involved
here,
the
pipefitters
fund
was
began
in
1949
and
at
first,
the
assessments
for
the
fund
and
for
the
union
dues
were
made
to
gather
and
exactly
the
same
way
and
applied
and
exactly
the
same
way
to
both
the
members
of
the
local
and
the
out-of-towner.
the
first
25
cents
per
day
was
paid
by
each
man
as
a
union
assessment
and
25
cents
per
day
to
the
fund.
later
it
was
50
cents
per
day
to
each
and
starting
in
january
1963,
which
is
the
indictment
period,
the
local
stopped
collecting
assessments
from
the
non-members
but
a
pattern
was
established
whereby
each
of
these
non-members
would
contribute
to
the
fund
at
the
same
rate
as
the
total
of
the
daily
contribution
of
a
member
of
the
local
to
the
fund
and
added
to
his
assessment
to
the
union.
and
these
were
still
being
treated
for
all
practical
purposes
collected
in
a
manner
that
they
have
previously
been
collected
as
assessments.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
was
evidence
that
they
did
not
question
about
the
contribution
with
an
obligation
that
they
had
to
the
union.
there
were
some
individual
testimony
that
after
failing
to
contribute,
the
man
was
not
hired
after
that
week
again.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
these
were
out-of-towners.
but
we
do
not
rely
on
that
testimony
alone
because
most
of
the
evidence,
it
seems
to
us
indicates
that
both
the
union
leadership
and
the
members
and
the
out-of-towners
considered
this
just
part
of
their
regular
obligations
to
the
union
that
would
be
regularly
paid
and
indeed
were
regularly
paid.
and
at
one
point,
the
union’s
executive
board
conveyed
this
impression
of
the
membership
quite
clearly.
this
is
recounted
at
page
11
of
our
brief.
in
the
middle
of
page
11,
at
the
time
that
there
was
a
50
cent
increase
in
the
assessment,
the
daily
assessment
of
union
members.
the
executive
board
minutes
distributed
to
the
members
explicitly
tied
this
to
a
50
cent
decrease
in
the
contributions
of
the
fund
that
would
then
be
expected
of
the
members
of
the
local.
and
the
quotation
from
the
minutes
distributed
to
the
members
was
we
believe
when
the
details
are
explained
to
all
of
you.
all
will
agree
as
we
do
on
this
matter
because
this
will
not
be
one
extra
penny
cost
to
members
of
local
union
562.
the
whole
assumption
is
that
every
member
pays
the
prescribed
contribution
to
the
fund.
and
therefore
because
the
union
treasury
needed
more
money
and
adjustment
would
be
made,
50
cents
more
to
the
treasury,
50
cents
less
to
the
fund
for
internal
bookkeeping
purposes.
it
would
not
affect
the
financial
obligations
of
the
members
at
all.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
but
that
instruction
was
given
in
the
context
of
the
entire
instruction
here
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
what
we
are
really
saying
is
that
the
basic
question
put
to
the
jury
was
were
this
really
union
monies
that
have
been
collected
in
the
manner
that
union
monies
are
collected
or
paid
in
as
union
monies?
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
think
that
is
not
the
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
now
that
is
--
you
see
that
is
where
i
stopped.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
the
contribution
was
not
made
for
political
purposes,
the
instructions
were
even
if
these
were
voluntary
contributions
if
they
were
union
monies,
they
were
being
used
illegally
under
the
statute.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
right.
and
not
political
money,
not
funds
that
were
voluntarily
being
contributed
for
the
purpose
of
supporting
political
causes
but
assessments
that
were
being
made
as
part
of
their
obligations
to
the
union.
what
congress
was
concerned
about
was
that
the
economic
power
of
the
organization
would
be
brought
to
bear
to
get
money
with
people
who
are
really
giving
for
other
reasons.
and
use
that
money
--
and
that
money
would
be
used
by
the
organization
for
political
purposes.
the
issue
put
to
the
jury
was,
was
this
really
money
being
given
by
these
individuals
to
the
union
for
union
purposes
because
they
wanted
to
support
the
union
or
thought
that
they
were
obligated
to
support
the
union
even
though
they
were
voluntarily
doing
it
in
the
sense
they
consented
to
make
the
payments
that
were
asked
of
them.
nonetheless,
the
question
of
the
jury
decided
was
that
these
union
monies
were
not
separate
monies
for
a
political
purposes
that
were
intended
to
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
voluntary.
justice,
the
assessments
are
voluntarily
paid
when
you
are
asked
to
pay
your
union
assessment,
you
pay
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
right.
but
it
was
used
over
and
over
again
in
the
testimony
by
people
who
said
that
they
paid
what
they
were
asked
to
voluntarily.
and
this
portion
of
the
instructions
starts
off
a
great
deal
of
evidence
has
been
introduced
and
whether
the
payments
were
voluntary
and
this
is
relevant
but
not
the
total
answer
of
the
question
the
judge
said.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
the
instruction
was
clear
on
that.
i
see
the
whole
trial
is
based
on
the
question
of
whether
this
was
a
bona
fide
political
fund
where
people
were
making
contributions
for
political
purposes.
or
whether,
they
were
really
paying
obligations
that
they
thought
they
had
to
pay
to
the
union
because
of
the
union’s
economic
power.
this
was
the
whole
theory
of
the
case
and
much
of
the
testimony
looked
in
this
direction.
i
would
like
if
may
to
refer
your
honors
to
the
testimony
of
one
man
who
was
an
out-of-towner
working
in
this
jurisdiction
which
is
in
volume
2
of
the
record
on
page
757.
the
cross-examination
begins,
sir,
your
testimony
is
that
you
got
from
$30.00
to
$40.00
more
per
week
when
you
are
working
on
a
st.
louis
job?
answer:
yes,
approximately.
the
question
is,
that
is
why
you
are
willing
to
pay
this
$10.00
a
week
into
the
fund?
answer:
yes.
and
then
after
some
intervening
questioning
on
page
759,
the
witness
says
it
is
to
my
interest
to
pay
the
voluntary
donation
because
the
wages
are
better
under
the
st.
louis
scale
than
they
are
in
the
case
of
gerardo’s
scale.
question:
yes
sir
and
it
is
a
good
deal
for
you
to
pay
$10.00
a
week
in
order
to
get
$30.00
to
$40.00
more
pay
a
week
out
of
that
job?
the
answer,
yes.
that
is
the
type
of
deal
that
you
are
saying
is
better
for
you?
yes.
and
then
the
question
and
except
for
that
you
would
not
be
voluntarily
paying
anything
would
you?
answer:
no.
now,
in
the
context
of
a
trial
in
which
voluntary
payments
was
used
in
that
manner
that
this
instruction
was
made
and
i
think
if
you
read
it
as
part
of
the
entire
instruction,
the
theory
of
the
case
follows
through
from
the
indictment
right
through
the
instructions
and
it
seems
to
us
implements
this
longstanding
congressional
purpose.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
record
does
indicate
that
strike
benefits
were
paid
and
that
the
money
was
also
used
to
purchase
this
retirement
or
recreation
center.
it
was
also
a
time
when
the
gift
fund
for
petitioner
callanan
was
now
deceased,
was
substituted
for
the
political
fund.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
payments?
yes
sir.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
all
we
have
is
a
record
and
accountant’s
record
of
disbursement
from
the
fund,
there
is
not
much
in
the
way
of
indication
of
how
the
funds
were
handled.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
disbursements
from
the
fund?
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
what
the
jury
decided
was
that
those
were
payments
really
made
by
the
union
and
that
is
what
the
statute
prevails.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
is
just
an
indication
that
the
leadership
of
the
union
treated
this
money
as
available
to
them
not
merely
for
political
expenditures
but
for
any
union
purposes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
including
political
expenditures.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
quite
so,
your
honor.
i
did
not
mean
to
say
that
the
statute
would
permit
the
union
to
make
political
contributions
in
a
situation
where
voluntary
contributions
were
being
made
to
the
union.
i
do
think
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
even
though
they
were
voluntarily
made
for
political
purposes.
it
will
be
a
different
case
from
this
one
and
i
think
a
more
difficult
case.
well,
we
believe
that
in
light
of
the
instructions
given
and
the
testimony
before
the
verdict
here,
properly
applied
the
statute
to
these
facts.
it
was
a
complicated
factor
determination
that
that
does
not
mean
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutionally
vague.
it
was
the
kind
of
actual
determination
that
often
has
to
be
made
in
cases
under
the
sherman
act
or
in
criminal
fraud
cases
involving
complex
business
transactions
where
factual
judgment
has
to
be
made
as
to
the
substance
of
the
transaction
that
was
placed
before
the
jury.
your
honor,
in
light
of
the
purposes,
congress
had
in
mind,
does
the
statute
reach
too
broadly
here,
because
i
think
the
evidence
in
this
case
shows
quite
persuasively,
that
it
was
a
reasonable
judgment
for
congress
to
make
that
no
lesser
measure
would
adequately
protect
individual
members
from
having
the
economic
power
of
these
organizations
brought
to
bear
upon
them
in
ways
that
would
cause
their
funds
to
exactly
to
support
political
causes
when
their
preference
might
really
be
not
to
support
those
cause
or
any
cause.
