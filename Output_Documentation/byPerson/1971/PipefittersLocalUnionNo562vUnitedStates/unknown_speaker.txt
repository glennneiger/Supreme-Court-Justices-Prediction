unknown
speaker
mr.
shenker,
does
the
record
show
what
percentage
of
the
union
members
signed
the
contribution
agreements?
unknown
speaker
was
any
of
the
money
used
for
other
than
political
purposes?
unknown
speaker
was
that
a
union
facility?
unknown
speaker
but
the
fund
was
used
for
--
i
mean
the
union
would
use
it
for
recreation?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
well
then
i
take
it
that
mr.
shenker,
the
issue
here
in
this
case
is
not
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
insofar
as
it
prohibits
the
union
from
using
membership
dues
normally
paid
in
and
checked
off
for
political
purposes?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
not
challenging
the
law
insofar
as
it
would
apply
the
use
of
membership
dues?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
--
unknown
speaker
do
you
or
did
you
in
the
lower
court
challenged
though?
unknown
speaker
right
across
the
board?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
did
not
ask
for
a
dismissal
of
the
indictment
on
the
basis
of
the
law
in
its
entirety
was
unconstitutional,
did
you?
unknown
speaker
and
you
have
never
claimed
that
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
mr.
shenker,
the
statute
meets
its
contributions
by
any
labor
organization?
unknown
speaker
in
your
position,
there
is
no
contribution
here
by
any
labor
organization?
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
basis
of
--
unknown
speaker
well,
i
gather
if
any
labor
organization
makes
a
contribution.
it
is
immaterial
whether
the
fund
from
which
the
contribution
is
made,
union
dues
or
some
other
funds
of
use,
right?
unknown
speaker
there
i
gather
the
charge
of
the
cause
is
the
labor
organization
with
the
team
--
unknown
speaker
--
who
made
the
contributions?
unknown
speaker
and
your
position
here
is
that
no
labor
organization
is
involved
and
the
contribution
is
made
by
an
organization
separate
from
the
labor
law?
unknown
speaker
and
you
are
also
claiming
that
the
union,
the
labor
organization
did
not
compel
members
to
make
the
contribution
to
the
separate
organization?
unknown
speaker
well,
except
as
mr.
justice
brennan
has
suggested
what
the
statute
prohibits
is
the
making
of
the
contribution
by
a
labor
organization
and
if
the
contribution
was
by
the
labor
organization,
there
is
a
violation
of
the
statute
regardless
of
where
those
funds
and
the
labor
organizations
came
from.
now
if
i
gave
your
union
$50,000.00
as
a
present
last
christmas,
right
to
the
union,
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
statute
to
make
a
political
contribution
with
that
$50,000.00
even
though
my
gift
was
wholly
voluntary?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
mr.
shenker,
do
i
understand
you
to
have
answered
mr.
justice
white
earlier,
that
if
we
agreed
that
indeed
this
voluntary
fund
was
simply
an
alter
ego
of
the
union?
unknown
speaker
and
that
you
attack
the
face
of
the
statute
--
unknown
speaker
--
as
unconstitutional
because
you
say
what,
the
--
prohibits
congress
to
enact
or
enacting
a
law
prohibiting
labor
unions
for
making
contributions?
unknown
speaker
only
if
made
voluntary?
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
that,
just
to
carry
it
on.
let
us
assume
that
a
union
collects
regular
dues
from
its
members
but
it
also
has
them
donate
voluntarily
pay
other
money,
and
with
the
consent,
for
the
union
to
use
it
for
political
purposes?
unknown
speaker
and
it
would
be
--
they
would
be
union
funds.
there
is
no
separate
fund
or
anything
else
and
the
union
uses
that
extra
money
for
political
purposes
presumably
that
the
statute
forbids
that?
unknown
speaker
the
statute
permits
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
if
it
did
not
permit
--
if
it
did
not
permit
it
you
would
say
the
statute
was
at
least
to
that
extent
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
so
you
say
the
crucial
thing
in
this
case
has
to
be
whether
or
not
the
members
voluntarily
make
contributions
for
political
purposes
and
really
if
they
are
relevant,
would
they
make
it
to
a
separate
fund
under
the
union?
unknown
speaker
so
you
were
taking
more
precautions
then
--
unknown
speaker
you
state
the
issue
on
page
24
of
your
brief.
so
the
issue
in
this
case
present
as
whether
congress
did
and
may
validly
prohibit
labor
unions
from
using
regular
unions
funds
to
make
direct
monetary
contributions
for
political
purposes
to
candidate
in
federal
elections
and
of
course
that
is
not
the
issue
at
all
from
the
point
of
view
of
your
opponents
on
the
other
side.
they
said
that
issue
is
not
here.
this
is
--
basically
here,
the
issues
are
factual
issues
and
that
is
whether
or
not
these
were
union
funds.
but
even
the
issue
as
you
stated.
mr.
wallace,
i
am
intrigued
by
that
word
“regular.”
that
does
not
appear
in
the
statute,
why
did
you
feel
the
need
to
put
that
adjective
in
there?
unknown
speaker
my
brother
white
gave
--
asked
the
question
involving
hypothetical
case
of
voluntary
contribution,
truly
voluntary
contributions
by
labor
union
members
to
the
union
and
ear-marked
for
further
contributions
to
political
cause
of
the
candidates
and
those
would
be
union
funds
but
they
would
not
be
regular
union
funds,
are
you
trying
to
carve
up
that
case
without
adjective?
unknown
speaker
well
mr.
wallace
in
that
respect,
what
about
the
request
to
instruct
that
the
jury
could
not
convict
unless
the
contributions
were
involuntary?
that
was
refused
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
the
statute
would
permit
conviction
even
though
the
contributions
were
voluntary?
unknown
speaker
the
difficulty
is
of
course
or
one
of
the
many
difficulties
in
this
case
is
that
the
jury
--
the
members
of
the
jury
were
instructed
that
they
could
return
a
verdict
to
guilty
in
this
case
even
if
they
found
that
every
contribution
to
the
fund
was
voluntary.
now
that
is
correct,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
you
are
asking
us
to
second
guess
the
jury
and
if
they
will
they
could
have
not
done
that
that
reasonable
man
must
have
found
all
the
contributions
were
involuntary
and
that
is
what
you
are
asking
us
to
do
in
this
face
of
your
argument?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
union
was
just
a
conduit
for
voluntary
contribution,
i
gather
that
you
implicitly
handed
at
least
at
the
outset
of
your
argument
that
those
might
not
be
regular
union
fund?
so
if
these
were
all
voluntary
--
unknown
speaker
all
are
voluntary
contributions
and
even
then
though
this
was
simply
an
alter
ego
of
the
union,
if
they
were
all
voluntary
contributions
made
for
political
purposes
by
the
contributors?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
the
jury
--
unknown
speaker
regular
union
monies.
unknown
speaker
well,
we
know,
we
may
have
--
the
jury
may
have
decided
that
every
single
one
of
these
contributions
of
the
voluntary
contribution
under
the
instructions.
unknown
speaker
the
difficulty
as
you
rightly
pointed
out
in
your
brief
is
that
the
adverb
voluntary
is
a
difficult
one
to
define
and
no
attempt
was
made
to
define
that
at
the
trial
of
this
case,
is
that
not
correct?
unknown
speaker
well
i
suppose,
it
is
not
even
consistent
for
somebody
to
give
something
to
a
union
for
political
purposes
and
also
be
able
to
say
that
after
it
is
given,
the
money
is
union
money.
i
mean
it
belongs
to
union.
they
just
are
going
to
use
it
for
political
purposes,
is
that
not
true?
now,
you
say
it
is
inconceivable
under
these
instructions
that
the
jury
could
have
found
that
there
were
--
that
these
monies
were
union
monies
even
though
voluntarily
given
for
political
purpose?
unknown
speaker
well,
anyway
mr.
wallace
--
unknown
speaker
well,
in
any
event
that
--
and
(inaudible)
that
even
though
payments
were
made
with
political
purpose
or
political
purposes
or
union
purposes,
not
the
individual
contributors?
unknown
speaker
the
$100,000.00
whatever
it
was
in
one
instance
$50,000.00?
that
those
were
paid
for
union
purposes
to
serve
union
end
not
to
serve
the
individuals
whose
contributions
made
up
the
fund?
unknown
speaker
one
had
to
rely
on
pension
on
that
strike
benefit
and
all
that
if
you
rush?
unknown
speaker
including
political
expenditures?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
how
often
(inaudible)
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
follows
through
with
the
contributions
to
a
union
and
still
not
have
the
union
merely
as
a
conduit
for
those
things,
if
the
union
itself
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
even
though
they
were
voluntarily
made
for
political
purposes?
unknown
speaker
mr.
shenker,
does
the
record
show
what
percentage
of
the
union
members
signed
the
contribution
agreements?
unknown
speaker
was
any
of
the
money
used
for
other
than
political
purposes?
unknown
speaker
was
that
a
union
facility?
unknown
speaker
but
the
fund
was
used
for
--
i
mean
the
union
would
use
it
for
recreation?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
well
then
i
take
it
that
mr.
shenker,
the
issue
here
in
this
case
is
not
the
question

the
constitutionality
of

you

do
you

do
you
or

right

well,
you
did
not
ask
for
a
dismissal
of
the
indictment
on
the
basis
of
the
law
in
its

was
unconstitutional,
did
you?
unknown

and
you
have
never

in

unknown

mr.
shenker,
the
statute
meets
its

any
labor

unknown
speaker
in
your
position,
there
is
no

here
by

unknown
speaker
is
that
the
basis
of

makes
a
contribution.
it
is
immaterial
whether
the

from

some

funds

right?
unknown
speaker
there
i
gather
the
charge

the
cause
is
the
labor

with
the

who
made

unknown

say
it
is
inconceivable
under
these
instructions
that
the
jury
could
have
found
that
there
were
--
that
these
monies
were
union
monies
even
though
voluntarily
given
for
political
purpose?
unknown
speaker
well,
anyway
mr.
wallace
--
unknown
speaker
well,
in
any
event
that

and
(inaudible)
that
even
though
payments
were
made
with
political
purpose
or
political
purposes
or
union
purposes,

the
individual
contributors?
unknown
speaker

$100,000.00
whatever
it
was
in
one

$50,000.00?
that
those
were
paid
for
union
purposes
to
serve
union
end
not
to
serve
the
individuals
whose
contributions
made
up
the
fund?
unknown
speaker
one
had
to
rely
on
pension
on
that
strike
benefit
and
all
that
if
you
rush?
unknown
speaker
including
political
expenditures?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
how
often
(inaudible)
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
follows
through
with
the
contributions
to
a
union
and
still
not
have
the
union
merely
as
a
conduit
for
those
things,
if
the
union
itself

unknown
speaker
even
though
they
were
voluntarily
made
for
political
purposes?
