chief

e.

mr.
shenker?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
any
of
the
contributors
specify
the
candidates
they
wanted
to
contribute
to
or
the
particular
political
party?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
shenker,
i
thought
this
case
had
been
tried
in
district
courts
entirely
on
the
theory
that
this
whole
thing
was
a
scheme
and
a
plan
and
subterfuge
to
have
this
committee
act
like
an
independent
committee
when
it
was
in
fact
the
union
functioning
under
another
name.
now,
was
that
not
the
government
theory?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
was
not
the
theory
of
the
case
much
like
the
theory
of
the
cases
where
the
government
or
some
other
litigant
tries
to
pierce
the
corporate
veil
and
show
that
what
pretends
and
purports
to
be
one
thing
is
really
something
else.
was
that
not
the
whole
idea
of
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
that
is
the
thrust
of
the
instructions
to
the
jury?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
shenker.
mr.
wallace.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
like
how
many
employees
contributed
to
the
fund
in
all?
i
think
these
are
not
too
clear
to
me
i
see
a
figure
2063
and
another
thing
you
have
2064
but
was
it
some
such
number
as
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
put
these
questions
here
that
i
put
to
mr.
shenker.
i
read
this
record
on
the
opinion
on
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
instruction
of
the
trial
judge
to
see
a
case
in
which
the
government
was
alleging
that
this
committee
was
just
upfront
that
was
in
the
same
building
on
the
same
floor.
it
was
run
by
the
officers
of
the
union
and
that
they
call
the
contributions
among
themselves
assessments
and
that
that
with
a
lot
of
other
bits
and
pieces
of
facts
added
up
the
proposition
that
this
committee
really
was
in
fact
the
union
even
though
in
name
it
had
another
name
now.
is
that
the
theory
that
the
government
is
standing
on?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
because
if
you
can
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
this
verdict
cannot
be
read
as
a
verdict
by
the
jury
that
this
committee
was
a
front
for
the
union
and
was
in
fact
the
union,
the
conviction
could
not
stand,
did
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
there
any
evidence
of
coercion
or
reprisal
against
employees
who
did
not
contribute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
these
were
the
out-of-towners?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
wallace.
mr.
shenker
you
have
one
minute
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
shenker,
what
was
the
legislative
purpose
of
this
fund?
what
were
they
going
to
do
with
the
money
for
legislative
purposes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
laws
related
unions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
kind
of
things?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
some
of
it
went
to
retired
members
of
the
union?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
from
the
charity
fund
but
from
the
fund
generally
was
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
going
back
to
this
legislative
fund,
were
they
interested
in
supporting
a
legislation
that
affected
the
union
or
was
it
an
activity
like
the
league
of
women’s
voters
that
is
for
everybody’s
benefit?
