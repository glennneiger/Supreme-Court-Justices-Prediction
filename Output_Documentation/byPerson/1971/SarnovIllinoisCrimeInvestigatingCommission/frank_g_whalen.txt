mr.
frank
g.
whalen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
this
court.
two
questions
are
presented
here
for
the
court’s
consideration.
first
question
is
considering
the
implication
of
the
questions,
the
circumstances,
and
setting
under
which
they
were
asked,
where
the
petitioner
is
justified
in
pleading
the
fifth
amendment
under
a
state
immunity
statute
according
to
the
--
to
afford
transactional
immunity.
and
the
second
question,
must
the
state
affirmatively
demonstrate
to
respondents
when
testifying
and
pursuant
to
the
illinois
immunity
act,
that
an
immunity
is
brought
in
scope
as
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
is
available
and
applicable
to
them.
in
1963,
the
illinois
legislature
created
the
illinois
crime
investigating
commission.
the
sole
purpose
of
which
was
to
investigate
organized
crime
in
the
state
of
illinois.
in
1968,
petitioners,
sarno
and
mccarty,
where
ordered
to
appear
and
give
testimony
before
this
commission.
they
appeared
and
refused
to
testify,
pleading
the
fifth
amendment.
now,
as
to
the
circumstances
and
the
studying
that
were
found
at
the
time
they
appeared,
the
first
would
be
that
illinois
at
this
time
had
a
double
standard
of
immunity
act.
there
was
the
grand
jury
act,
which
applied
to
proceedings
before
grand
juries
and
to
--
and
before
trial
courts.
under
this
the
grand
jury
act,
a
witness
was
given
immunity
from
prosecution
for
any
offense
shown
in
whole
or
in
part
by
such
testimony.
further,
this
act,
the
grand
jury
act
had
been
interpreted
by
the
illinois
state
supreme
court
in
people
versus
walker,
28
illinois
2nd
585
and
there
the
supreme
court
in
very
strong
language
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
that
act.
in
fact,
the
court
there
said
that
the
statue
eliminates
the
constitutional
privilege
against
self
incrimination.
now,
the
state
of
illinois
immunity
act
which
we
are
concerned
here
with,
provided
a
witness
shall
not
be
prosecuted
or
an
account
of
any
transaction,
matter
or
thing
concerning
which
he
gave
answer.
the
act
further
contained
this
provision.
the
court
shall
not
order
any
such
person
to
testify
or
produce
evidence
if
it
reasonably
appeared
to
the
court
that
such
testimony
or
evidence
would
subject
such
witness
to
an
indictment,
information
or
prosecution
under
the
laws
of
another
state
or
of
the
united
states.
this
statute
had
never
been
interpreted
by
the
state
supreme
court
and
was
first
interpreted
on
this
offensive
appeal.
this
was
a
public
hearing
without
the
privacy
in
terms
of
grand
jury
proceeding,
and
it
became
obvious
to
the
petitioners
that
the
questions
asked
were
based
upon
records
that
had
been
at
a
prior
time,
illegally
seized
from
the
home
of
the
petitioner
mccarty.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
yes,
it
is.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
i
would
like
commit
to
--
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
well,
i
can
only
assume
mr.
justice
that
it
is
to
report
as
to
the
various
prosecuting
agents.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
no
and
then,
i
am
really
not
sure
of
my
answer,
but
it
is
my
understanding
that
that
would
be
the
function.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
oh,
i
believe
very
much
so.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
yes
sir,
yes
indeed.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
that
is
my
understanding,
sir.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
i
believe
so.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
yes
sir.
yes
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
it
is
my
understanding
that
it
does
for
the
purpose
of
the
legislature
enacting
further
laws.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
its
report
is
made
public,
its
hearings
are
public,
in
every
sense
of
the
word
public,
that
is
advertised
in
other
words,
its
--
it
is
a
very
public
proceeding
and
under
these
conditions,
to
petitioners
it
became
apparent
that
the
questions
were
based
on
records
that
had
been
illegally
seized
from
the
home
of
the
petitioner
mccarty
on
a
previous
occasion.
these
records
had
been
ordered
suppressed
in
the
trial
court
and
returned
to
the
petitioners.
however,
they
latter
at
this
time
found
--
brought
it
to
them.
further,
at
this
time,
illinois
had
six
statutes
of
carried
immunity
provisions
and
contained
the
phrase
“or
subjected
to
penalty
or
forfeiture.”
state
of
illinois
at
this
time
had
a
malice
is
the
just
of
the
action
statute,
providing
six
months
imprisonment
in
the
county
jail
and
had
at
this
time
enacted
a
law
making
criminal
usury
a
felony.
further
as
to
the
sudden
circumstances,
the
state
of
illinois
at
this
had
more
provision
for
discovery
in
criminal
cases.
in
the
same
and
under
these
to
circumstances
then,
the
petitioners
where
examine
concerning
more
than
200
transactions.
and,
it
was
apparent
that
in
the
event
of
future
prosecutions
it
would
be
impossible
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
the
prosecution
was
based
upon
evidence
independently
obtained
or
upon
the
fruit
or
the
links
of
the
compelled
testimony.
the
questions
that
were
oppose
to
the
petitioner’s
fell
into
five
separate
categories.
they
have
been
abstracted
in
our
brief
and
i
would
refer
to
one
that
question
at
abstract
42,
question
12
and
ask,
suppose
in
the
petitioners
had
been
asked
only
this
question.
the
question,
at
what
places
in
cook
county
have
your
dues
customers
met
you
to
make
their
weekly
payments
and
petitioners
gave
answers
to
the
question.
assume
then
that
the
state
went
to
these
places
interviewed
all
those
found
there
and
learned
from
them
that
petitioners
had
committed
anyone
of
the
offenses,
punishable
under
the
criminal
code.
whether
committed
against
the
particular
persons
that
they
interviewed
or
against
some
persons
known
to
them.
well,
petitioners
then
would
be
in
a
position
where
they
have
no
asked,
they
had
not
been
asked
to
give
answer
to
any
act
of
violence.
nevertheless,
the
answer
to
the
question
would
be
the
link,
necessarily
to
prosecute
them
for
offense
of
violence.
they
further
believed
that
the
illinois
state
legislature
when
creating
this
commission
did
not
intent
to
afford
or
did
not
intent
for
it
to
afford
an
immunity
as
broad
in
scope
as
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
the
courts
two
years
after
the
opinion
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
people
versus
walker
in
which
they
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
the
grand
jury
act,
this
immunity
act
was
amended,
but
the
pertinent
language
to
which
i
have
referred
remain
untouched,
which
indicates
to
me
certainly
and
to
the
petitioners
that
the
legislature
under
this
act,
the
immunity
act
did
not
intend.
certainly,
they
did
not
afford
an
immunity
as
broad,
but
petitioners
believed
that
was
not
even
intended.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
this
--
it
was
first
interpreted
upon
this
instant
appeal
and
there
the
supreme
court
held
that
under
this
statute,
the
court
did
not
have
power
to
grant
express
immunity,
but
that
murphy
work
versus
the
waterfront
supplied
the
necessary
compliment
and
held
it
constitutional.
now
--
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
co-extensive,
yes.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
provided
mr.
chief
justice
that
he
could
establish
that
that
evidence
was
independently
obtained.
we
--
i
do
not
believe
that
it
was
intended
nor
do
i
believe
that
under
the
language
of
the
statute,
this
fifth
amendment
privilege
was
extended
and
certainly
not
an
immunity
as
broad
as
a
privilege.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
yes.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
illinois
has
never
decided
that
the
burden
is
upon
the
prosecution
or
who
upon
whom
the
burden
was
placed.
i
could
only
answer
that
there
would
be
no
way
for
the
petitioner
to
bring
it
to
the
attention
because
could
not
tell.
he
could
not
tell.
because
you
see,
they
are
only
asked,
they
are
referring
to
any
answer
--
20
question
he
gave
answer,
and
that
leads,
leads
and
leads
to
others
that
he
did
not
give
answer.
i
cannot
conceive
mr.
chief
justice
how
as
the
defense
attorney,
how
the
petitioners
in
a
subsequent
prosecution
could
ever
determine
whether
or
not
this
prosecution
was
based
on
independently
obtained
evidence
or
was
the
fruit
of
the
links.
and
in
addition,
in
illinois
at
that
time,
we
do
now
have
by
rule
of
the
supreme
court,
not
by
statute,
not
by
any
act,
we
do
have
a
limited
discovery,
but
at
this
time,
there
was
not
discovery
in
the
state
of
illinois,
in
criminal
cases
and,
i
do
know
how
counsel
could
of
be
of
assistance
to
a
petitioner
faced
with
the
subsequent
prosecution
and
ascertaining
that
fact.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
i
did
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
we
were
concerned
there
with
the
provision
that
where
the
court
--
recently
approve
the
court.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
yes.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
yes.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
no,
it
was
not
raised
in
that
manner
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
i
would
say
they
did
not.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
whether
or
not
the
statute
affords
an
immunity,
as
brought
in
fifth
precede
--
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
it
is
our
contention
that
under
these
circumstances,
it
does
not
and
that
it
was
not
intended
to.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
i
certainly
do
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
yes,
sir,
provided
--
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
provided
mr.
chief
justice
that
he
could
establish
that
this
was
the
fruit
or
the
links
and
he
alleges
that
under
these
circumstances,
he
could
not
and
of
course
when
you
rely
on
murphy
--
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
yes.
i
say
that
while
statute
--
while
the
statute
purports
to
grant
transactional
immunity
it
does
not.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
it
did
not,
sir
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
it
does
use
the
word
transaction,
but
it
also
uses
the
language
to
which
he
gave
answer
and
we
do
not
believe
that
that
affords
them
transactional
immunity.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
yes,
because
the
example
that
i
have
given
and
which
is
abstracted
and
the
question,
where
in
cook
county
do
your
costumers
need
you
to
make
your
dues
payments.
now,
he
is
not
asked
for
anything,
any
question,
he
gives
no
answer
with
regarding
the
crime
of
violence.
however,
if
he
answers
this
question
and
the
state
authorities
go
to
these
places
and
interview
whoever
is
there
and
learn
of
a
crime
of
violence,
he
would
be
absolutely
unable
--
in
other
words
what
we
believe
is
that
if
this
statute
be
only
is
designed
to
represent
an
exchange
for
the
privilege,
it
is
a
poor
exchange
because
the
petitioner
winds
up
much
the
worst
for
it.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
that
is
true
mr.
justice.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
i
am
objecting
to
that
sir.
it
not
--
it
directs
the
commission,
it
directs
the
court
who
enters
the
order.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
not
to
--
not
to
grant
immunity
if
it
reasonably
appeared
to
that
court
that
the
answer
could
involve
prosecution
in
another
state
or
under
the
law
--
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
--
of
and
we
say
that
a
witness
confronted
with
this
situation
is
misled
or
at
least
he
does
not
know,
they
will
be
doubt
in
his
mind
because
he
cannot
tell
--
he
cannot
tell
under
those
circumstances
just
to
extent
of
the
immunity
is
being
granted.
and,
which
leads
to
the
second
question
of
--
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
it
is
a
direction
to
the
court.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
yes,
except
that
the
petitioner
faced
with
the
statute
does
not
know.
certainly,
he
could
not
be
in
contempt
for
refusing
to
obey
a
void
order
and
he
does
not
know
now
under
these
circumstances,
under
these
questions
had
been
asked,
whether
or
not,
it
should
reasonably
appear
to
the
judge
that
the
answers
might
involve
him
with
a
prosecution
in
another
state
or
--
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
yes.
he
can
do
that
and
he
does
that
at
his
peril.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
this
of
course
was
a
--
at
the
time
of
these
were
seized,
this
was
at
the
indictment
level.
they
were
suppressed
and
ordered
return
in
the
trial
court.
now,
had
the
government
--
the
petitioners
here
would
have
no
way
of
--
they
would
assume
and
believe
that
the
govern
--
that
the
local
officials
did
go
to
the
places.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
what
would
be
the
difference?
only
served
at
--
if
they
placed
a
future
prosecution,
they
would
have
known
and
certainly
there,
the
difference
is
that
they
were
not
granted
any
immunity.
there
was
not
even
any
question
about
immunity
being
granted.
that
was
a
strictly
a
fourth
amendment
question.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
perhaps,
i
do
not
make
myself
clear.
mr.
justice,
these
records
were
seized
by
the
city
of
chicago
police
department.
now,
this
is
prior
to
this
commission
--
those
orders
where
ordered
--
those
records
were
suppressed
at
trial
and
ordered
to
be
turned
and
were
returned.
we
assume
of
course
that
they
recall
the
standard
one
jurisdiction
gave
up
to
the
inquiring
commission.
that
is
we
cannot
prove
that,
it
is
only
logical
conclusion.
in
fact,
this
is
never
been
denied
by
the
state
in
any
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
yes.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
yes
and
illinois
then
referred
to
murphy
versus
--
the
illinois
supreme
court
referred
to
murphy
versus
waterfront
commission,
but
it
is
our
position
that
that
applies
only
where
in
the
state
proceeding,
a
state
witness
hears
federal
prosecution
and
here
we
are
talking
about
further
state
prosecution.
it
is
not
argued
by
the
petitioners
here
that
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
embraces
civil
suits
or
punitive
damages,
but
in
conjunction
with
a
analysis
with
the
gist
of
the
statute
where
they
can
be
imprisoned
for
six
months
on
a
great
number
of
judgments,
that
is
then
it
becomes
penal
in
nature
of
penal
and
character.
what
they
are
simply
contending
here
is
that
under
these
circumstances
and
the
setting,
the
state
of
illinois
denied
them
their
federal
privilege.
the
federal
privilege
being
that
they
should
have
received
an
immunity
in
exchange
for
their
testimony,
they
should
have
received
an
immunity
as
broad
and
scope
as
the
privilege
and
it
is
supplanted.
they
did
not.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
i
would
say
mr.
chief
justice
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
do
so,
even
at
the
trail
of
other
subsequent
crime.
i
know
of
no
matter
in
which
it
could
be
tested.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
except
that
the
--
he
would
still
be,
and
i
do
not
know
how
to
answer
otherwise,
he
would
still
be
absolutely
unable
to
ascertain
this
or
to
establish
this
fact.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
no,
mr.
chief
justice
it
would
not.
while
that
burden
--
while
that
burden
would
be
upon
the
prosecution
to
show
that
it
was
independently
obtained,
i
know
of
no
manner
in
which
the
petitioners
could
controvert
it
because
they
have
not
an
immunity
as
to
the
subsequent,
as
to
the
fruits
under
this
act.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
it
could
be
stated
--
formally
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
yes,
sir.
i
believe
that
and
i
believe
that
the
state
must,
duty
is
upon
the
state
to
affirmatively
demonstrate
at
the
time
petitioners
wherein
that
that
--
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
certainly
mr.
justice.
however,
of
course
as
i
said,
this
was
interpreted
on
this
appeal
for
the
first
time,
that
we
do
not
have
the
benefit
of
any
such
holding,
a
lot
of
time.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
that
is
right
sir.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
i
am
still
--
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
that
is
exactly
the
point
mr.
justice.
we
believe
that
the
--
that
any
supplants
to
privilege
or
bridges
the
privilege
must
give.
in
that
camp,
it
must
give
immunity
then
it
is
brought
with
the
privilege
taken.
that
is
our.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
i
believe
so.
i
believe
so
mr.
justice.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
that
is
our
point.
point
to
the
point
of
whether
a
state
must
affirmatively
demonstrate
to
the
respondents,
the
respondents
would
not
testify,
we
have
a
situation
here
now
where
a
--
an
immunity
act
contains
the
provision
that
the
court
shall
not
grant
immunity
if
it
reasonably
appears
that
the
witness
may
fear
prosecution
by
another
state
or
the
united
states,
we
come
to
the
situation
where
it
somewhat
like
the
situation
in
reilly
versus
ohio
where
a
witness
maybe
misled,
and
we
have
the
language
used
by
this
court
in
steven
versus
marks
in
which
they
said
until
at
such
time,
the
witness
has
a
right
to
stand
on
his
fifth
amendment
privilege.
certainly
in
this
instance,
it
was
never
demonstrated.
how
can
the
state
of
illinois
argue
that
they
ever
demonstrated
to
the
petitioners
that
a
privilege
was
available
to
them,
where
they
engaged
in,
were
part
of
the
very
act,
it
contains
the
language
of
complainant.
this
is
no
longer
in
the
illinois
immunity
act.
this
has
been
amended
and
has
been
removed.
however
at
that
time,
it
was
a
pertinent
part
of
it.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
the
provision
of
--
the
provision
that
the
court,
if
the
reason
it
appeared
to
the
court
that
--
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
that
has
been
eliminated.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
no,
it
has
been
eliminated.
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
no.
i
believe
they
would
say
that
if
--
now,
it
would
be
department
or
to
the
decisions
in
the
later
cases.
what
we
urge
the
court
to
consider
is
that
when
a
witness
appeared
before
an
investigative
committee
under
such
immunity
act,
there
should
be
no
doubt
in
the
minds
of
the
witness
as
to
what
immunity
he
is
getting.
we
believe
that
the
state
of
illinois
has
that
duty,
we
believe
that
state
failed.
in
throughout
their
briefs,
in
all
these
proceedings
and
here
in
this
court,
the
state
argues
that
they
manifested
--
the
state
manifested
its
intent
not
to
prosecute
further.
and,
we
do
not
believe
that
answers
supply
this.
it
is
not
the
intent,
the
present
intent
of
the
state
not
to
prosecute
further.
the
assurance
that
a
petitioner
should
receive
and
what
is
guaranteed
by
the
federal
constitution
is
that
the
state
be
unable
to
prosecute
him
further.
thank
you.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
this
court.
two
questions
are
presented
here
for
the
court’s
consideration.
first
question
is
considering
the
implication
of
the
questions,
the
circumstances,
and
setting
under
which
they
were
asked,
where
the
petitioner
is
justified
in
pleading
the
fifth
amendment
under
a
state
immunity
statute
according
to
the
--
to
afford
transactional
immunity.
and
the
second
question,
must
the
state
affirmatively
demonstrate
to
respondents
when
testifying
and
pursuant
to
the
illinois
immunity
act,
that
an
immunity
is
brought
in
scope
as
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
is
available
and
applicable
to
them.
in
1963,
the
illinois
legislature
created
the
illinois
crime
investigating
commission.
the
sole
purpose
of
which
was
to
investigate
organized
crime
in
the
state
of
illinois.
in
1968,
petitioners,
sarno
and
mccarty,
where
ordered
to
appear
and
give
testimony
before
this
commission.
they
appeared
and
refused
to
testify,
pleading
the
fifth
amendment.
now,
as
to
the
circumstances
and
the
studying
that
were
found
at
the
time
they
appeared,
the
first
would
be
that
illinois
at
this
time
had
a
double
standard
of
immunity
act.
there
was
the
grand
jury
act,
which
applied
to
proceedings
before
grand
juries
and
to
--
and
before
trial
courts.
under
this
the
grand
jury
act,
a
witness
was
given
immunity
from
prosecution
for
any
offense
shown
in
whole
or
in
part
by
such
testimony.
further,
this
act,
the
grand
jury
act
had
been
interpreted
by
the
illinois
state
supreme
court
in
people
versus
walker,
28
illinois
2nd
585
and
there
the
supreme
court
in
very
strong
language
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
that
act.
in
fact,
the
court
there
said
that
the
statue
eliminates
the
constitutional
privilege
against
self
incrimination.
now,
the
state
of
illinois
immunity
act
which
we
are
concerned
here
with,
provided
a
witness
shall
not
be
prosecuted
or
an
account
of
any
transaction,
matter
or
thing
concerning
which
he
gave
answer.
the
act
further
contained
this
provision.
the
court
shall
not
order
any
such
person
to
testify
or
produce
evidence
if
it
reasonably
appeared
to
the
court
that
such
testimony
or
evidence
would
subject
such
witness
to
an
indictment,
information
or
prosecution
under
the
laws
of
another
state
or
of
the
united
states.
this
statute
had
never
been
interpreted
by
the
state
supreme
court
and
was
first
interpreted
on
this
offensive
appeal.
this
was
a
public
hearing
without
the
privacy
in
terms
of
grand
jury
proceeding,
and
it
became
obvious
to
the
petitioners
that
the
questions
asked
were
based
upon
records
that
had
been
at
a
prior
time,
illegally
seized
from
the
home
of
the
petitioner
mccarty.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
yes,
it
is.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
i
would
like
commit
to
--
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
well,
i
can
only
assume
mr.
justice
that
it
is
to
report
as
to
the
various
prosecuting
agents.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
no
and
then,
i
am
really
not
sure
of
my
answer,
but
it
is
my
understanding
that
that
would
be
the
function.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
oh,
i
believe
very
much
so.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
yes
sir,
yes
indeed.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
that
is
my
understanding,
sir.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
i
believe
so.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
yes
sir.
yes
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
it
is
my
understanding
that
it
does
for
the
purpose
of
the
legislature
enacting
further
laws.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
its
report
is
made
public,
its
hearings
are
public,
in
every
sense
of
the
word
public,
that
is
advertised
in
other
words,
its
--
it
is
a
very
public
proceeding
and
under
these
conditions,
to
petitioners
it
became
apparent
that
the
questions
were
based
on
records
that
had
been
illegally
seized
from
the
home
of
the
petitioner
mccarty
on
a
previous
occasion.
these
records
had
been
ordered
suppressed
in
the
trial
court
and
returned
to
the
petitioners.
however,
they
latter
at
this
time
found
--
brought
it
to
them.
further,
at
this
time,
illinois
had
six
statutes
of
carried
immunity
provisions
and
contained
the
phrase
“or
subjected
to
penalty
or
forfeiture.”
state
of
illinois
at
this
time
had
a
malice
is
the
just
of
the
action
statute,
providing
six
months
imprisonment
in
the
county
jail
and
had
at
this
time
enacted
a
law
making
criminal
usury
a
felony.
further
as
to
the
sudden
circumstances,
the
state
of
illinois
at
this
had
more
provision
for
discovery
in
criminal
cases.
in
the
same
and
under
these
to
circumstances
then,
the
petitioners
where
examine
concerning
more
than
200
transactions.
and,
it
was
apparent
that
in
the
event
of
future
prosecutions
it
would
be
impossible
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
the
prosecution
was
based
upon
evidence
independently
obtained
or
upon
the
fruit
or
the
links
of
the
compelled
testimony.
the
questions
that
were
oppose
to
the
petitioner’s
fell
into
five
separate
categories.
they
have
been
abstracted
in
our
brief
and
i
would
refer
to
one
that
question
at
abstract
42,
question
12
and
ask,
suppose
in
the
petitioners
had
been
asked
only
this
question.
the
question,
at
what
places
in
cook
county
have
your
dues
customers
met
you
to
make
their
weekly
payments
and
petitioners
gave
answers
to
the
question.
assume
then
that
the
state
went
to
these
places
interviewed
all
those
found
there
and
learned
from
them
that
petitioners
had
committed
anyone
of
the
offenses,
punishable
under
the
criminal
code.
whether
committed
against
the
particular
persons
that
they
interviewed
or
against
some
persons
known
to
them.
well,
petitioners
then
would
be
in
a
position
where
they
have
no
asked,
they
had
not
been
asked
to
give
answer
to
any
act
of
violence.
nevertheless,
the
answer
to
the
question
would
be
the
link,
necessarily
to
prosecute
them
for
offense
of
violence.
they
further
believed
that
the
illinois
state
legislature
when
creating
this
commission
did
not
intent
to
afford
or
did
not
intent
for
it
to
afford
an
immunity
as
broad
in
scope
as
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
the
courts
two
years
after
the
opinion
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
people
versus
walker
in
which
they
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
the
grand
jury
act,
this
immunity
act
was
amended,
but
the
pertinent
language
to
which
i
have
referred
remain
untouched,
which
indicates
to
me
certainly
and
to
the
petitioners
that
the
legislature
under
this
act,
the
immunity
act
did
not
intend.
certainly,
they
did
not
afford
an
immunity
as
broad,
but
petitioners
believed
that
was
not
even
intended.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
this
--
it
was
first
interpreted
upon
this
instant
appeal
and
there
the
supreme
court
held
that
under
this
statute,
the
court
did
not
have
power
to
grant
express
immunity,
but
that
murphy
work
versus
the
waterfront
supplied
the
necessary
compliment
and
held
it
constitutional.
now
--
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
co-extensive,
yes.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
provided
mr.
chief
justice
that
he
could
establish
that
that
evidence
was
independently
obtained.
we
--
i
do
not
believe
that
it
was
intended
nor
do
i
believe
that
under
the
language
of
the
statute,
this
fifth
amendment
privilege
was
extended
and
certainly
not
an
immunity
as
broad
as
a
privilege.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
yes.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
illinois
has
never
decided
that
the
burden
is
upon
the
prosecution
or
who
upon
whom
the
burden
was
placed.
i
could
only
answer
that
there
would
be
no
way
for
the
petitioner
to
bring
it
to
the
attention
because
could
not
tell.
he
could
not
tell.
because
you
see,
they
are
only
asked,
they
are
referring
to
any
answer
--
20
question
he
gave
answer,
and
that
leads,
leads
and
leads
to
others
that
he
did
not
give
answer.
i
cannot
conceive
mr.
chief
justice
how
as
the
defense
attorney,
how
the
petitioners
in
a
subsequent
prosecution
could
ever
determine
whether
or
not
this
prosecution
was
based
on
independently
obtained
evidence
or
was
the
fruit
of
the
links.
and
in
addition,
in
illinois
at
that
time,
we
do
now
have
by
rule
of
the
supreme
court,
not
by
statute,
not
by
any
act,
we
do
have
a
limited
discovery,
but
at
this
time,
there
was
not
discovery
in
the
state
of
illinois,
in
criminal
cases
and,
i
do
know
how
counsel
could
of
be
of
assistance
to
a
petitioner
faced
with
the
subsequent
prosecution
and
ascertaining
that
fact.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
i
did
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
we
were
concerned
there
with
the
provision
that
where
the
court
--
recently
approve
the
court.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
yes.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
yes.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
no,
it
was
not
raised
in
that
manner
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
i
would
say
they
did
not.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
whether
or
not
the
statute
affords
an
immunity,
as
brought
in
fifth
precede
--
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
it
is
our
contention
that
under
these
circumstances,
it
does
not
and
that
it
was
not
intended
to.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
i
certainly
do
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
yes,
sir,
provided
--
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
provided
mr.
chief
justice
that
he
could
establish
that
this
was
the
fruit
or
the
links
and
he
alleges
that
under
these
circumstances,
he
could
not
and
of
course
when
you
rely
on
murphy
--
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
yes.
i
say
that
while
statute
--
while
the
statute
purports
to
grant
transactional
immunity
it
does
not.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
it
did
not,
sir
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
it
does
use
the
word
transaction,
but
it
also
uses
the
language
to
which
he
gave
answer
and
we
do
not
believe
that
that
affords
them
transactional
immunity.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
yes,
because
the
example
that
i
have
given
and
which
is
abstracted
and
the
question,
where
in
cook
county
do
your
costumers
need
you
to
make
your
dues
payments.
now,
he
is
not
asked
for
anything,
any
question,
he
gives
no
answer
with
regarding
the
crime
of
violence.
however,
if
he
answers
this
question
and
the
state
authorities
go
to
these
places
and
interview
whoever
is
there
and
learn
of
a
crime
of
violence,
he
would
be
absolutely
unable
--
in
other
words
what
we
believe
is
that
if
this
statute
be
only
is
designed
to
represent
an
exchange
for
the
privilege,
it
is
a
poor
exchange
because
the
petitioner
winds
up
much
the
worst
for
it.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
that
is
true
mr.
justice.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
i
am
objecting
to
that
sir.
it
not
--
it
directs
the
commission,
it
directs
the
court
who
enters
the
order.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
not
to
--
not
to
grant
immunity
if
it
reasonably
appeared
to
that
court
that
the
answer
could
involve
prosecution
in
another
state
or
under
the
law
--
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
--
of
and
we
say
that
a
witness
confronted
with
this
situation
is
misled
or
at
least
he
does
not
know,
they
will
be
doubt
in
his
mind
because
he
cannot
tell
--
he
cannot
tell
under
those
circumstances
just
to
extent
of
the
immunity
is
being
granted.
and,
which
leads
to
the
second
question
of
--
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
it
is
a
direction
to
the
court.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
yes,
except
that
the
petitioner
faced
with
the
statute
does
not
know.
certainly,
he
could
not
be
in
contempt
for
refusing
to
obey
a
void
order
and
he
does
not
know
now
under
these
circumstances,
under
these
questions
had
been
asked,
whether
or
not,
it
should
reasonably
appear
to
the
judge
that
the
answers
might
involve
him
with
a
prosecution
in
another
state
or
--
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
yes.
he
can
do
that
and
he
does
that
at
his
peril.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
this
of
course
was
a
--
at
the
time
of
these
were
seized,
this
was
at
the
indictment
level.
they
were
suppressed
and
ordered
return
in
the
trial
court.
now,
had
the
government
--
the
petitioners
here
would
have
no
way
of
--
they
would
assume
and
believe
that
the
govern
--
that
the
local
officials
did
go
to
the
places.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
what
would
be
the
difference?
only
served
at
--
if
they
placed
a
future
prosecution,
they
would
have
known
and
certainly
there,
the
difference
is
that
they
were
not
granted
any
immunity.
there
was
not
even
any
question
about
immunity
being
granted.
that
was
a
strictly
a
fourth
amendment
question.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
perhaps,
i
do
not
make
myself
clear.
mr.
justice,
these
records
were
seized
by
the
city
of
chicago
police
department.
now,
this
is
prior
to
this
commission
--
those
orders
where
ordered
--
those
records
were
suppressed
at
trial
and
ordered
to
be
turned
and
were
returned.
we
assume
of
course
that
they
recall
the
standard
one
jurisdiction
gave
up
to
the
inquiring
commission.
that
is
we
cannot
prove
that,
it
is
only
logical
conclusion.
in
fact,
this
is
never
been
denied
by
the
state
in
any
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
yes.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
yes
and
illinois
then
referred
to
murphy
versus
--
the
illinois
supreme
court
referred
to
murphy
versus
waterfront
commission,
but
it
is
our
position
that
that
applies
only
where
in
the
state
proceeding,
a
state
witness
hears
federal
prosecution
and
here
we
are
talking
about
further
state
prosecution.
it
is
not
argued
by
the
petitioners
here
that
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
embraces
civil
suits
or
punitive
damages,
but
in
conjunction
with
a
analysis
with
the
gist
of
the
statute
where
they
can
be
imprisoned
for
six
months
on
a
great
number
of
judgments,
that
is
then
it
becomes
penal
in
nature
of
penal
and
character.
what
they
are
simply
contending
here
is
that
under
these
circumstances
and
the
setting,
the
state
of
illinois
denied
them
their
federal
privilege.
the
federal
privilege
being
that
they
should
have
received
an
immunity
in
exchange
for
their
testimony,
they
should
have
received
an
immunity
as
broad
and
scope
as
the
privilege
and
it
is
supplanted.
they
did
not.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
i
would
say
mr.
chief
justice
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
do
so,
even
at
the
trail
of
other
subsequent
crime.
i
know
of
no
matter
in
which
it
could
be
tested.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
except
that
the
--
he
would
still
be,
and
i
do
not
know
how
to
answer
otherwise,
he
would
still
be
absolutely
unable
to
ascertain
this
or
to
establish
this
fact.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
no,
mr.
chief
justice
it
would
not.
while
that
burden
--
while
that
burden
would
be
upon
the
prosecution
to
show
that
it
was
independently
obtained,
i
know
of
no
manner
in
which
the
petitioners
could
controvert
it
because
they
have
not
an
immunity
as
to
the
subsequent,
as
to
the
fruits
under
this
act.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
it
could
be
stated
--
formally
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
yes,
sir.
i
believe
that
and
i
believe
that
the
state
must,
duty
is
upon
the
state
to
affirmatively
demonstrate
at
the
time
petitioners
wherein
that
that
--
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
certainly
mr.
justice.
however,
of
course
as
i
said,
this
was
interpreted
on
this
appeal
for
the
first
time,
that
we
do
not
have
the
benefit
of
any
such
holding,
a
lot
of
time.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
that
is
right
sir.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
i
am
still
--
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
that
is
exactly
the
point
mr.
justice.
we
believe
that
the
--
that
any
supplants
to
privilege
or
bridges
the
privilege
must
give.
in
that
camp,
it
must
give
immunity
then
it
is
brought
with
the
privilege
taken.
that
is
our.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
i
believe
so.
i
believe
so
mr.
justice.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
that
is
our
point.
point
to
the
point
of
whether
a
state
must
affirmatively
demonstrate
to
the
respondents,
the
respondents
would
not
testify,
we
have
a
situation
here
now
where
a
--
an
immunity
act
contains
the
provision
that
the
court
shall
not
grant
immunity
if
it
reasonably
appears
that
the
witness
may
fear
prosecution
by
another
state
or
the
united
states,
we
come
to
the
situation
where
it
somewhat
like
the
situation
in
reilly
versus
ohio
where
a
witness
maybe
misled,
and
we
have
the
language
used
by
this
court
in
steven
versus
marks
in
which
they
said
until
at
such
time,
the
witness
has
a
right
to
stand
on
his
fifth
amendment
privilege.
certainly
in
this
instance,
it
was
never
demonstrated.
how
can
the
state
of
illinois
argue
that
they
ever
demonstrated
to
the
petitioners
that
a
privilege
was
available
to
them,
where
they
engaged
in,
were
part
of
the
very
act,
it
contains
the
language
of
complainant.
this
is
no
longer
in
the
illinois
immunity
act.
this
has
been
amended
and
has
been
removed.
however
at
that
time,
it
was
a
pertinent
part
of
it.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
the
provision
of
--
the
provision
that
the
court,
if
the
reason
it
appeared
to
the
court
that
--
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
that
has
been
eliminated.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
no,
it
has
been
eliminated.
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
no.
i
believe
they
would
say
that
if
--
now,
it
would
be
department
or
to
the
decisions
in
the
later
cases.
what
we
urge
the
court
to
consider
is
that
when
a
witness
appeared
before
an
investigative
committee
under
such
immunity
act,
there
should
be
no
doubt
in
the
minds
of
the
witness
as
to
what
immunity
he
is
getting.
we
believe
that
the
state
of
illinois
has
that
duty,
we
believe
that
state
failed.
in
throughout
their
briefs,
in
all
these
proceedings
and
here
in
this
court,
the
state
argues
that
they
manifested
--
the
state
manifested
its
intent
not
to
prosecute
further.
and,
we
do
not
believe
that
answers
supply
this.
it
is
not
the
intent,
the
present
intent
of
the
state
not
to
prosecute
further.
the
assurance
that
a
petitioner
should
receive
and
what
is
guaranteed
by
the
federal
constitution
is
that
the
state
be
unable
to
prosecute
him
further.
thank
you.
mr.
frank
g.
whalen
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
