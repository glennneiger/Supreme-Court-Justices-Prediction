mr.
joel
m.
flaum
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court.
there
is
no
double
standard
in
illinois.
illinois
is
a
transaction
state.
it
has
been
so
for
at
least
to
half
the
century
and
some
of
the
strongest
language
contains
in
the
state
court
cases.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
frankly
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
is
not
as
strong
at
some
of
the
language
contained
in
the
cases
preceded.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
well,
i
would
submit
it
justice
stewart
that
it
does
say
that
section
speaking
of
the
specific
section
involved
here
grants
immunity
to
defendants
from
further
prosecution.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
no,
i
appreciate
it
does
not
carry
that
kind
of
language.
if
i
might
just
amplify
on
it
a
little
bit.
illinois
in
cases
starting
in
1924
right
up
until
1963
constantly
referred
to
federal
precedent,
the
councilman
cases,
the
barnes
(ph)
cases.
it
spoke
in
terms
of
complete
substitute
protection
against
all
future
prosecutions.
our
state
is
never
had
a
history
of
a
use
statute.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
yes.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
well,
your
honor,
in
1953,
the
illinois
supreme
court
had
occasion
to
consider
the
identical
language
in
the
cigarette
tax
act,
the
immunity
section
of
it,
the
identical
language.
as
has
this
court,
in
norman
and
in
brown
in
1956
and
1959,
the
language
in
the
1953
case
from
illinois
(inaudible)
in
415
illinois
said
and
this
identical
to
that
holding,
in
order
to
hold
valid
a
statute
requiring
a
person
to
give
evidence
which
might
tend
to
incriminate
him,
the
immunity
afforded
must
brought
enough
to
protect
him
against
all
future
punishment
for
any
offenses
to
which
the
evidence
relate.
that
is
on
identical
language.
i
wish
it
would
found
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
statutory
language,
interpreting
statutory
language.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
not
the
same
statute.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
exactly,
and
i
just
to
reiterate
again,
this
going
to
stand
in
the
immunity
act
of
1954
which
is
court
upheld
as
granting
complete
immunity.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
no,
but
we
follow
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
right,
but
we
follow
mr.
justice
stewart,
all
the
federal
precedent
is
involved
and
while
it
was
not
binding
prior
to
1964,
it
is
found,
we
--
our
language
speaks
of
that
as
being
complete
as
to
the
type
of
immunity
grant
within
(voice
overlap)
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
yes,
we
do.
it
is
identical
in
effect
in
the
united
states
constitution.
i
am
not
just
to
make
one
mention
with
regard
to
the
structure
of
illinios
crime
investigating
commission.
at
the
time
of
its
creation
and
in
the
time
when
these
questions
went
on,
it
was
mixed
commission.
it
had
four
from
the
house,
four
from
the
senate
and
four
private
members
appointed
by
the
governor.
it
is
now
totally
legislative
commission
and
reports
directly
to
that
body,
but
that
is
the
question
arose
as
to
with
--
as
to
its
competition.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
yes,
it
is.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
no.
no,
there
are
not.
in
fact
it
as
required
mr.
chief
justice,
to
submit
in
the
annual
report
to
the
state
legislature
and
that
is
required
in
the
public.
if
our
argument
prevails
that
we
have
full
transactional
immunity,
fifth
amendment
was
never
aimed
towards
avoiding
social
appropriance
(ph)
or
the
acknowledgment
of
one’s
right.
it
just
is
the
guarantee
that
no
criminal
process
would
be
brought
against
him,
the
state
of
illinios
shall
ensure,
we
believe.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
mr.
justice
white,
i
would
suggest
that
upon
a
reading
of
the
cases
prior
(inaudible)
illinois
supreme
court
that
if
a
meaningful
deviation
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
--
were
to
occur?
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
never
occur
like
this.
its
language
and
it
is
not
as
expensive.
i
would
like
to
be
here,
but
i
frankly
think
any
deviation
from
a
history
that
we
have
had
would
not
be
much
more
significant.
speaking
specific
on
that,
i
want
to
dwell
on
it
that
for
and
account
of,
we
feel
--
there
should
be
no
question
on
it.
if
this
court
would
have
forget
about
how
illinois
has
interpreted,
just
changes
mind
on
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
that
is
our
position.
on
the
affirmative
showing,
frankly,
we
feel
a
complete
affirmative
showing,
maybe
a
fact
from
possibility
short
of
appellant
review
and
every
time
they
grant
the
immunity
is
conferred.
however,
the
references
and
the
petitioner’s
brief
to
marks
and
reilly
have
no
analogy
to
this
case
at
all.
there
is
actually
no
evidence
of
intentional
misleading
of
any
citizen
when
called
before
the
commission.
the
requirement
as
we
read
in
reilly
is
that
the
affirmative
showing
in
the
state
may
not
mislead
the
witnesses
as
to
the
consequences
of
his
answer
or
his
refusal
to
answer.
the
state
cannot
be
required
to
meet
him
a
possible
substantive
argument
which
later
maybe
promulgate
by
the
witness
is
on
appeal,
and
which
intents
conviction
which
we
feel
the
case
here.
illinios
met
that
test
that
we
feel
in
this
case.
unlike
marks
for
example,
petitions
were
represented
at
all
times
by
counsel.
after
the
first
refusal,
the
commission,
first
reviewed
and
testified
by
the
petition,
the
commission
filed
verbatim
transcripts
with
the
court
requesting
an
order
to
grant
the
immunity.
both
men
filed
responsive
pleading
and
i
might
point
up
to
the
court
if
i
may,
that
at
no
time
really
has
this
act
ever
been
challenged
as
being
a
use
plus
fruit.
it
is
just
been
charged
with
being
a
defective
transaction.
there
was
always
an
acknowledgment
by
the
petitioners
below
that
the
state
was
attempting
to
confer
transactional
immunity,
only
that
if
had
a
defective
statute
in
which
he
was
working.
both
men
filed
responsive
pleading
then
accepted
that
basic
premise.
after
the
grant
of
immunity,
both
men
again
appeared
and
refused
to
testify.
thirdly,
really
fourthly,
after
the
second
questioning
of
both
parties,
counsel
for
the
commission
read
the
order
of
immunity,
gave
an
opportunity,
a
third
opportunity,
spelled
out
specifically
what
the
counsel
would
do
if
and
by,
that
i
mean
recommending
to
the
commission
that
they
go
to
court
and
seek
contempt,
so
that
if
this
is
not
constitute
the
affirmative
showing.
the
willingness
to
confer
transaction
immunity
is
--
has
spoken
through
both
the
order
of
the
court
which
granted
the
immunity,
and
the
counsel
for
the
commissions,
frankly,
i
see
no
collateral
remedy
that
would
suffice
you
order
an
instant
review
on
appeal
and
then
i
will
return
to
that.
we
fill
that
there
are
--
this
in
not
at
all
a
case
where
there
is
any
misleading.
they
were
suggesting
in
the
opinions
in
reilly
and
marks
that
the
defendant
did
not
even
know
of
the
existence
of
the
immunity
statute.
that
just
did
not
occur
here.
this
has
been
a
contested
with
counsel
type
litigations
for
several
years.
i
can
only
say
that
there
is
no
evidence
on
any
statute
in
the
state
of
illinois
where
there
has
been
a
subsequent
prosecution
which
would
lead
one
to
the
believe
that
there
has
been
an
attempt
to
use
the
use
plus
fruits
approach
with
any
of
its
immunity
statute
from
our
state,
and
we
feel
that
clearly
reading
of
the
illinios
history
would
indicate,
if
that
is
the
case.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
yes.
the
state
of
illinois
has
adapted
for
that
higher
standard.
if
this
court
be
stepped
to
adopt
the
use
plus
fruits,
illinois
apparently
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
may
re-consider
but
it
has
committed
itself
to
transaction.
if
this
statute
falls
it
falls
within
effectiveness
in
structuring.
it
does
not
fall
through
the
intent
that
we
believe
of
the
legislative.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court.
there
is
no
double
standard
in
illinois.
