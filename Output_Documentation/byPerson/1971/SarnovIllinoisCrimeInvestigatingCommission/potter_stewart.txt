justice
potter
stewart
what
are
duties
in
the
event
that
does
as
--
it
does
has
what
it
is
before
that
do
answer
questions,
what
does
it
do
with
him?
justice
potter
stewart
not
just
to
the
state
legislature?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
it
appeared
correctly,
you
are
understanding
that
this
agency
is
a
kin
to
the
new
jersey
commission
from
which
we
have
just
heard?
justice
potter
stewart
rather
than
just
a
legislative?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
transactional
immunity?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
illinois
supreme
court
did
not
toll
one
way
or
the
other
on
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
question
as
i
read
their
answers
and
you
said
that
you
say
constitutionally,
you
are
entitled
to
transactional
immunity
of
your
client?
justice
potter
stewart
and,
i
would
suggest
off
hand
that
at
least
a
casual
reading
of
the
first
part
of
203-14
seems
to
grant
your
client
transactional
immunity,
does
is
not?
using
the
very
word,
transaction?
justice
potter
stewart
to
which
he
gave
answer
or
produced
evidence?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
fact
is
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
really
has
not
been
construed
(voice
overlap)?
justice
potter
stewart
i
have
the
idea
that
you
are
also
objecting
in
this
case
to
the
second
part
of
the
203-14
that
part
of
it
that
purports
to
give
some
kind
of
immunity
against
the
released
or
at
least
required
--
at
least
directs
the
commission
not
to
require
with
a
witness
to
answer
with
respect
to
prosecuted,
could
lead
to
the
danger
of
prosecution
in
another
jurisdiction,
are
you
objecting
to
that?
justice
potter
stewart
right,
it
has
actually
had
the
information.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
he
really
is
not
being
granted
any
immunity,
is
he,
in
the
second
part
against
the
prosecution
by
another
sovereign
because
it
is
just
the
direction
to
the
court
and
it
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
court
tells
him
to
answer,
that
is
it.
and
then
--
justice
potter
stewart
or
is
that
already
that
he
contests
on
that
against
citation
for
refuse
to
answer?
justice
potter
stewart
can
he?
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand,
your
argument
is
simply
this
mr.
whalen
if
your
client
is
entitled
under
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendment
and
he
continued
to
refuse
to
answer
these
questions
until
or
unless
the
state
makes
clear
to
him
that
he
is
given
transactional
immunity,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
should
probably
in
that
right
here
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
far
the
state
has
not
tolled
any
(inaudible)?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
if
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
had
said
in
this
litigation
that
this
immunity
statute
extends
transactional
immunity
to
your
client,
the
councilman
against
hitchcock
immunity,
that
is
--
you
would
be
satisfied,
you
could
have
won
your
case,
and
you
concede
then
that
your
client’s
would
have
the
ability
to
answer,
do
you
not?
justice
potter
stewart
the
answer
is
--
the
illinois
supreme
court
did
not
give
you
an
answer
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
still
have
an
area
there
--
justice
potter
stewart
got
an
assurance
of
transactional
immunity
and
assured
your
point
that
the
constitution
accords
you
that.
in
exchange
for
the
answers
to
the
questions
asked
by
your
client,
is
that
your
point?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
for
a
court
to
say
the
immunity
given
is
as
broad
as
the
constitutional
protection
is
double
talk,
is
not
it?
justice
potter
stewart
you
got
me
that
to
say
what
the
immunity
is
and
you
are
entitled
in
answer
to
your
--
the
issue
you
present,
it
that
your
point?
justice
potter
stewart
right,
this
act
before
us
has
now
been
amended?
justice
potter
stewart
in
what
respect?
justice
potter
stewart
that
part
of
it?
justice
potter
stewart
eliminated
entirely?
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
no
substitute
to
this?
justice
potter
stewart
you
characterize
the
illinois
supreme
court’s
opinion
in
this
case
as
being
containing
you
strong
or
an
ambiguous
language
with
respect
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
statute
gives
transactional
immunity?
justice
potter
stewart
it
does
not
even
address
itself
to
the
question,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
does
not
answer
the
question.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
that
was
under
a
different
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
and,
that
was
at
the
time
when
it
was
not
clear
that
the
federal
constitution
guarantee
against
compulsory
self
incrimination
without
the
approval
of
state
because
it
is
prior
in
the
law,
against
them?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
identical
language
or
statutory
language?
justice
potter
stewart
not
the
same
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
okay,
but
some
of
the
statute
from
which
the
statute
borrows
the
language?
justice
potter
stewart
you
are
talking
about
1953-54,
that
was
prior
to
law
against
hogan
(ph)
and
it
was
any
business
with
this
court
would
be,
was
it,
what
kind
of
immunity
illinois
gave
because
illinois
did
not
have
any
federal
constitutional
obligation
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
protect
somebody
from
compulsory
self
incrimination
because
that
was
the
regime
of
twining
against
new
jersey,
was
not
it?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
it
is
not
a
state
constitution
law?
justice
potter
stewart
i
say,
yours
is
the
picarello
case
that
even
though
they
--
even
know
it
maybe
determined
in
the
companion
cases
today,
that
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
does
not
require
of
the
state
of
illinois
to
grant
transactional
immunity
but
nonetheless,
you
do
so?
justice
potter
stewart
it
may
re-consider
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
are
duties
in
the
event
that
does
as
--
it
does
has
what
it
