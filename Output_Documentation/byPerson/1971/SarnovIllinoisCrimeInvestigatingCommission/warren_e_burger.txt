warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
number
70-7,
sarno
against
the
illinois
crime
investigating
commissioner.
mr.
whalen,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
this
commission
a
legislative
commission,
mr.
whalen?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
much
like
i
suppose
arisen
now,
but
it
is
not
much
like
a
congressional
committee
conducting
an
inquiry
into
this
particular
subject?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
there
is
nothing
that
will
prevent,
if
the
committee
of
the
congress
conducted
an
investigation,
it
is
traditional,
is
it
not,
that
all
those
reports
are
made
available
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states,
if
they
seem
to
disclose
violations
of
law?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
routine?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
first
instance
does
this
commission
report
back
to
the
legislature,
do
you
know?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
its
report
made
public?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
has
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
held
with
respect
to
whether
the
statute
is
co-extensive
with
fifth
amendment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
how
did,
co-extensive
with
the
fifth
amendment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then,
let
us
pursue
a
particular
case.
you
are
concern
about
this
client
that
you
represent
here.
suppose
he
should
be
prosecuted
in
the
future,
assuming
hypothetical
this
court
it
will
then
take
same
position
as
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
and
then
he
was
prosecuted
for
something,
and
you
claim
that
it
was
derivative
from
the
questions
and
answers
and
not
to
inquiry.
would
not
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
be
bound
under
its
holding
to
afford
him
whatever
protection
the
fifth
amendment
would
have
afforded
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
from
the
states,
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
illinois
treating
the
question
has
said
that
it
is
co-extensive
with
the
fifth
amendment.
now,
that
is
clear
is
not
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but,
whether
they
are
not
being
obliged
in
reviewing
any
future
conviction,
would
they
not
be
bound
to
see
to
it
that
he
got
that
degree
of
protection
by
whatever
steps?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
disagree
with
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
would
that
and
i
repeat
would
that
court
not
be
found
in
the
future
case
against
your
particular
client
which
you
claim
was
derivative
from
this
investigation?
would
they
not
be
bound
to
give
them
all
the
protection
that
the
fifth
amendment
gives
him
as
it
is
construed
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
defined
in
the
murphy
among
other
cases?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
get
clear
if
i
can.
your
view
of
what
the
illinois
supreme
court
held,
in
your
brief
you
say,
the
illinois
supreme
court
held
with
the
certain
omissions,
that
the
immunity
referred
to
in
section
203-14
was
co-extensive
with
the
fifth
amendment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
your
position
as
to
what
illinois
has
held?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
you
really
test
that
in
the
case
like
this
mr.
whalen?
that
is
my
--
it
is
my
problem.
do
not
you
have
to
test
the
scope
with
this
immunity
by
a
prosecution
for
a
subsequent
crime
in
light
of
the
supreme
court
--
illinois
supreme
court’s
view
of
the
matter?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
first,
you
have
a
number
of
alternatives
that
he
may
never
be
prosecuted
in
which
case,
there
will
be
no
problem
is
assuming
he
went
on
and
answered
or
if
he
prosecuted,
you
could
assert
that
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
has
said
that
his
immunity
is
freedom
from
prosecution
and
was
co-extensive
with
fifth
amendment
protection
and
that
issue
would
be
presented
by
that
case,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
what
if
hypothetically
the
burden
is
on
the
prosecution
to
establish
that
the
case
rested
on
information
from
an
independent
source?
would
that
give
you
the
protection
that
you
need?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
thank
you
mr.
whalen.
mr.
flaum?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
everything
it
does
is
open
to
the
news
media
and
therefore
to
all
prosecutors?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
there
will
be
no
secret
to
the
reports
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
your
time
is
up,
mr.
whalen?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
number
70-7,
sarno
against
the
illinois
crime
investigating
commissioner.
mr.
whalen,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
this
commission
a
legislative
commission,
mr.
whalen?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
much
like
i
suppose
arisen
now,
but
it
is
not
much
like
a
congressional
committee
conducting
an
inquiry
into
this
particular
subject?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
there
is
nothing
that
will
prevent,
if
the
committee
of
the
congress
conducted
an
investigation,
it
is
traditional,
is
it
not,
that
all
those

are
made
available
to
the
attorney
general
of
the

if
they
seem

of

chief

warren
e.
burger
it
is
routine?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
first
instance
does
this
commission
report
back
to
the
legislature,
do
you
know?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
its
report
made
public?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
has
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
held
with
respect
to
whether
the
statute
is
co-extensive
with
fifth
amendment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
how
did,
co-extensive
with
the
fifth
amendment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then,
let
us
pursue
a
particular
case.
you
are
concern
about
this
client
that
you
represent
here.
suppose
he
should
be
prosecuted
in
the
future,
assuming
hypothetical
this

it
will
then
take
same
position
as
the

and
then

was
prosecuted
for
something,
and
you
claim
that
it
was

the
questions
and
answers
and
not
to

would
not
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
be
bound
under
its
holding
to
afford
him
whatever
protection
the
fifth
amendment
would
have
afforded
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
from
the
states,
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
illinois
treating
the
question
has
said
that
it
is
co-extensive
with
the
fifth
amendment.
now,
that
is
clear
is
not
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but,
whether
they
are
not
being
obliged
in
reviewing
any
future
conviction,
would
they
not
be
bound
to
see
to
it
that
he
got

of

by
whatever

chief

warren
e.

would
you
disagree
with
the

of
illinois
then?
chief

warren
e.
burger
well,
would
that
and
i
repeat
would
that
court
not
be
found
in
the
future
case
against
your
particular
client
which
you
claim
was
derivative
from
this
investigation?
would
they
not
be
bound
to
give
them
all
the
protection
that
the
fifth

gives
him
as
it
is
construed
--
chief

--
defined
in

chief

chief

warren
e.

that
is
your
position
as
to
what
illinois
has
held?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
you
really
test
that
in
the
case
like
this
mr.
whalen?
that
is
my
--
it
is
my
problem.
do
not
you
have
to

the

by
a

in
