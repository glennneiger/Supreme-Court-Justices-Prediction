unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
the
old
--
unknown
speaker
those
actions
you
say
mr.
cutler
are
class
actions
and
that
they
asked
for
damages
as
well
as
for
the
injunction?
unknown
speaker
and
are
they
also
--
the
class
actions
are
they
also
parens
patriae
action?
unknown
speaker
and
in
our
case
today
as
a
parens
patriae
claim
but
not
a
class
action
[voice
overlap]
unknown
speaker
and
as
only
for
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
oh
what
is
that
parens
patriae?
unknown
speaker
would
then
we
have
a
case
here?
unknown
speaker
but
in
any,
you
don't
challenge
their
standing
or
their
cause
of
action
that
you
don't
say
they
don't
plead
the
cause
of
action?
unknown
speaker
and
you
don't
contest
our
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
for
a
retrofit
as
you
would
say
for
what
kind
of
device
would
be
put
on
the
car
or
ready
in
use
owned
by
a
driver
in
a
state?
unknown
speaker
that
is
correct.
[voice

unknown
speaker
let's
assume
the
question
was,
what
kind
of
a
--
let's
assume
that
it
was
found
that
there
was
an
antitrust
violation
under
the
federal
standards.
now
on
the
remedy,
what
kind
of
retrofit
device
would
--?
unknown
speaker
it
would
be
ordered
to
be
installs
in
california
as
compared
the
illinois?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
part
of
your
argument
was
the
congress
has
said
in
the
situation
like
this
state
law
is
to
be
the
governing
standard?
unknown
speaker
if
we
were
saying
--
if
we
were
saying
federal
law
governs
this
suit
that
we
must
look
to
state
law
to
see
what
the
federal
standard
should
be
and
a
state
that
says
there
is
no
retrofit
law
in
our
state?
unknown
speaker
there
would
be
no
remedy
if
you
--
so,
either
you
can
have
dirtier
lawsuits
under
the
federal
act?
unknown
speaker
there's
no
effect
on
old
cars.
unknown
speaker
there's
no
effect
on
idaho
but
idaho
could
--
unknown
speaker
then
idaho
would
not
be
one
of
these
complaining
parties
in
this
course?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
that
the
only
remedy
that
you
are
seeking
that
is
in
addition
of
what
the
government
already
had?
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
that
congress
has
left
the
retrofit
matter
to
the
states?
unknown
speaker
is
congress
free
to
specify
the
standard
applicable
in
original
actions?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
relying
on
this
congressionally
set
standard
in
bringing
this
action
namely
the
sherman
act?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
you
--
unknown
speaker
if
congress
is
free
to
provide
the
law
that
would
govern
original
actions
on
this
one?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
say
jurisdiction,
i
just
said
the
law.
i
have
specified
the
law.
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
make
it
to
control
the
remedy.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
if
under
that
law
does
the
state,
pay
the
car?
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
the
old
