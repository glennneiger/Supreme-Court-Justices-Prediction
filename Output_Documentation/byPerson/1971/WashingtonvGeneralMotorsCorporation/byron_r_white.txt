it's
not
--
what
do
you
view
of
the
parens
patriae,
you
see
--
you
say
that's
what
this
is
in
the
story?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
cutler,
do
you
say
that
some
of
these
cases
in
the
district
courts
are
essentially
different
from
each
other?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
if
the
--
if
there
was
a
special
master
appointed
--
if
we
took
jurisdiction
and
appointed
a
special
master
and
he
face
the
--
these
same
states,
would
you
suggest
that
he
may
have
to
try
different
states
separately?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
we
have
jurisdiction
and
then
special
master
proceeded.
i
take
it
that,
that
in
suit
like
this
federal
law
govern
--
that
in
your
submission
a
suit
like
this
as
to
determining
the
existence
of
an
antitrust
violation
and
the
remedy
federal
law
would
govern?
and
would
you
or
are
you
suggesting
that
the
action
of
congress
would
suggest
to
the
special
master
into
this
court
that
in
that
although
as
a
federal
law
would
govern
the
remedy
that
we
would
borrow
state
law
or
state
standard?
justice
byron
r.
white
aren't
these
defendants
already
entered
an
injunction?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
do
you
want
in
addition
to
what
the
government
already
has?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
let's
say
that
we
took
jurisdiction
and
found
an
antitrust
violation
and
then
would
we
be
free
in
case
of
what
congress
has
said
the
fashion
here,
our
own
standards
with
respect
to
the
used
car,
the
cars
on
the
road?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
congress
have
said
that
as
far
as
the
past
is
concerned
that
the
federal
law
should
at
the
very
least
look
to
the
states
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
for
standards?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
address
yourself
to
this
matter
in
your
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
we
ask
you
about
what
were
the
governing
law
would
be
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
it's
federal
law
but
in
the
process
of
fashioning
federal
law,
do
we
have
to
look
to
the
state
law
borrow
state
law
in
light
of
what
congress
has
said?
