it
says
as

strategies
from

oh
they
didn't
invent
that?
justice

they

it's

my
understanding
of
the
federal

new
federal
law
is
if
the
federal
standard
would
apply
into
cars
manufactured
after
a
certain
date
and
that
the
petition
here
is
talking
about
cars
especially
on
the
road
you
have,
isn't
that
right?
justice

my
question
is
this,
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
that
phase
of
the
problem
is
what
do
states
to
work
out
as
they
might
choose,
is
it
not?
justice
william

douglas
so
you
could
have
50
different
standings
for
a
retrofit?
justice
william

douglas
but
we're
not
dealing
with
an
overall
federal
rule.

only
federal
rule
is
a

a

that
leaves
it
to
the

does
the
state
have
some
leeway
under
the
federal
law?

if
we

justice
william
o.
douglas
he
took
the
case
and
we
had
hearings
then
a
decree,
that
would
not
in
anyway
touch
the
environmental
protection
agency,
would
it?

in
