mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
defendants
urged
that
this
case
is
governed
by
your
decision
at
the
last
term
in
wyandotte
and
that
in
one
important
sense
it
simpler
than
wyandotte.
in
wyandotte,
you
based
your
decision
on
two
major
grounds
the
availability
of
another
impartial
and
no
less
of
appropriate
forum
even
though
ohio
had
not
filed
suit
in
that
forum
and
as
a
cogent
reason,
a
practical
wisdom
for
declining
jurisdiction
on
the
light
of
your
other
responsibilities
the
possibility
of
imminent
legislative
and
administrative
relief
for
the
factually
and
technically
complex
environmental
problem
they
are
involved.
in
the
present
case,
the
court
need
not
reason
on
the
basis
of
the
hypothetical
availability
of
other
no
less
appropriate
forums
or
on
the
mere
possibility
of
legislative
and
administrative
relief.
in
the
present
cases,
the
same
plaintiffs
states
and
the
amici
states
have
already
filed
essentially
the
same
suits
against
all
the
defendants
and
other
more
appropriate
district
court
forums
where
a
pre-trial
preparation
as
mr.
tausend
told
you
or
actively
proceeding
and
more
over
a
comprehensive
program
on
legislative
and
administrative
relief
or
the
even
more
complex
environmental
problems
here
both
the
federal
and
the
state
level
is
already
an
on-going
fact.
i
would
like
to
ask
the
court
if
it
would
to
look
at
our
supplemental
memorandum
in
our
position
which
is
the
cream-colored
memorandum
filed
on
december
23
and
if
you
will
turn
to
the
appendix
of
that
memorandum,
you
will
see
a
compilation
of
all
of
these
pending
district
court
cases
which
have
now
been
consolidated
for
pre-trial
purposes
--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
i
don't
think
it's
correct
to
say
mr.
justice
douglas
that
it
is
impossible,
it
is
our
belief
number
one
that
the
question
of
whether
these
cases
should
be
transferred
to
a
single
district
for
trial
and
then
consolidated
for
trial
is
a
question
that
can
be
best
evaluated
when
the
pre-trial
proceedings
are
further
along
the
identity
of
the
witnesses
and
the
nature
the
issues
are
better
known,
the
question
of
whether
the
cases
as
they
present
themselves
for
the
different
states
are
essentially
different
cases
in
major
aspects
such
as
the
quality
of
the
air
in
the
given
state
the
impact
of
the
defendants'
activities
on
the
quality
of
the
air
in
that
state
and
the
relationships
that
have
going
on
between
the
regulatory
authorities
and
the
automobile
companies
in
that
state.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
no,
sir.
i
am
suggesting
that
is
an
entirely
appropriate
question
for
the
district
courts
to
resolve
under
the
transfer
powers
and
the
consolidation
powers
when
the
pre-trial
proceedings
are
further
along.
moreover,
if
you
would
look
at
the
appendix,
sir,
you
will
see
that
these
plaintiffs,
most
of
them
after
they
filed
the
single
case
before
you
when
the
time
came
as
mr.
tausend
mentioned
when
they
decided
to
file
district
court
complaints
to
protect
against
a
fairly
remote
statute
of
limitations
possibility.
they
filed
those
complaints
not
in
one
action
as
they
filed
before
you
which
they
were
perfectly
free
to
do.
they
filed
those
complaints
as
you
will
see
on
page
42
of
appendix
a
in
some
12
different
federal
districts,
eight
of
them
as
widely
separate
as
hawaii
and
maine
as
it
happens
elected
to
file
a
single
complaint
in
the
central
district
of
california.
but
the
others
for
reasons
best
known
to
themselves
elected
to
file
in
separate
districts
thus
creating
the
transfer
problem
about
which
they
are
now
complaining.
in
fact,
they
did
this
after
we,
in
our
initial
memorandum
and
opposition
to
the
filing
of
the
complaint
here,
had
said
that
these
courts,
original
jurisdiction
is
not
necessary
if
they
want
to
achieve
their
purpose
of
the
single
trial.
all
they
had
to
do
was
get
together
and
file
a
single
complaint
of
the
same
type
in
a
single
district
court
which
they
did
not
do.
moreover,
even
though
they
failed
to
do
it
the
district
courts
among
them
clearly
have
the
power
to
transfer
these
cases
under
section
1404
and
to
consolidate
them
for
trial
under
rule
42.
should
they
conclude,
despite
the
arguments,
we
may
very
well
make
to
do
contrary
after
the
conclusion
of
the
pre-trial
discovery
that
consolidation
and
transfer
are
not
in
the
interest
of
justice.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
no,
they're
not
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
because
liability
in
a
section
16
action
and
in
a
section
4
action
which
this
plaintiffs
have
also
brought
in
the
district
courts
depends
first
on
the
proof
of
an
antitrust
conspiracy
let
us
say,
and
second
on
the
impact
of
that
conspiracy
on
the
particular
plaintiff.
for
example,
there
is
an
allegation
on
these
complaints
that
the
defendant
conspired
to
delay
the
installation
of
one
particular
retrofit
device
on
vehicles
in
the
state
of
california
for
one
year.
we
would
intend
to
show
not
only
that
we
did
not
so
conspire
but
that
if
we
had,
that
particular
act
could
have
had
no
effect
or
certainly
no
tangible
impact
on
the
quality
of
the
air
or
any
injury
to
the
state
of
hawaii
or
the
state
of
maine
or
any
of
the
other
states
which
were
not
directly
involved
in
that
particular
act.
if
you
will
look
again
at
this
list
of
cases
at
page
42,
many
of
these
cases
in
the
district
courts
in
fact
all
of
those
that
are
brought
by
states
are
contained
the
same
allegations
that
are
contained
in
these
cases
before
you.
but
in
addition
to
that
they
are
class
actions
brought
on
behalf
of
all
the
political
units
in
those
states
and
they
are
also
actions
for
damages
and
we
would
submit
to
you
that
the
district
courts
which
have
those
cases
before
them
are
far
better
able
to
deal
with
the
plaintiffs
present
request
made
to
the
district
court
to
drop
their
damage
claims
and
to
deal
with
the
question
of
how
the
dropping
of
those
claims
is
to
be
resolved
among
the
various
members
of
their
classes
and
to
how
the
question
of
dropping
the
damage
claims
in
some
but
not
all
of
the
state
cases
because
california
has
declined
to
drop
its
damage
claim
and
has
declined
to
seek
this
early
equity
trial
how
those
problems
are
to
be
resolved.
first,
to
make
sure
that
the
dismissal
of
this
class
action
complaints
below
is
properly
approved
by
the
court
and
second,
how
any
jury
trial
or
right
to
jury
trial
issues
under
beacon
theaters
are
to
be
resolved.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
all
of
them
plead
parens
patriae
claims
including
the
ones
before
you.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
it's
not
a
class
action
before
you.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
that
is
correct
and
remember
of
course
that
you
have
before
you
only
18
of
the
states
whereas
the
district
court
has
before
it
some
36
states.
one
of
which
at
least
has
said
specifically
it
does
not
intend
to
drop
its
damage
claim
and
does
not
intend
to
seek
this
early
equity
trial
therefore
raising
this
set
of
be
beacon
theaters
problems
that
only
the
district
court,
we
believe,
can
resolve
since
it
has
all
these
cases
before
it.
it
has
all
the
classes
and
it
can
arrive
at
the
proper
resolution
of
which
cases
should
be
tried
first.
i
want
to
say
in
that
connection
in
the
light
of
mr.
tausend's
comments
first
that
what
he
quoted
from
my
remarks
below
before
judge
real
dealt
essentially
with
the
question
of
when
transfer
and
consolidation
where
right
issues
for
consideration
and
not
with
the
question
of
essentially
of
power
in
the
district
courts
to
accomplish
those
two
things
whenever
that
might
be
required.
now
--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
i
say
only
mr.
justice
white
that
these
plaintiffs
have
pleaded
their
case
as
a
parens
patriae
claim
for
the
injunctive
relief
they
seek
in
this
court,
whether
the
parens
patriae
point
is
significant
and
that,
i
have
no
idea.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
this
i
take
it
is
the
issue
you
have
before
you
and
hawaii
case
but
their
claim
is
that
on
behalf
of
all
the
citizens
of
their
state
they
are
seeking
the
injunctive
relief
which
they
claim
to
be
necessary
to
improve
the
quality
of
the
air
in
their
state
--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
--
for
an
antitrust
violation.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
no,
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
i
am
not
making
an
issue
of
the
fact
that
they
have
included
the
parens
patriae
claim
and
i
don't
know
that
it
is
significant
to
your
question
of
whether
that
you
should
accept?
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
well,
i
believed
that
they
are
suing
as
states
and
as
parens
patriae.
they
say
they
bring
in
this
action
in
their
capacity
as
parens
patriae,
etcetera,
etcetera,
etcetera
and
as
proprietors,
state
lands,
properties
and
resources.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
no
sir
and
in
fact
we
do
not
challenge
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
courts
in
anyway
these
defendants
are
suable
and
virtually
any
district,
they
have
not
contested
the
suits
pending
in
any
state
--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
we
of
course,
we
don't
contest
your
jurisdiction
sir.
the
--
not
only
is
the
district
court
a
perfectly
appropriate
forum
and
equally
appropriate
forum
field.
we
submit,
your
honors,
that
the
district
court
is
a
more
appropriate
forum
even
though
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
for
us
for
you
to
reach
that
level
of
proof.
you
have
only
taken
one
original
antitrust
case
so
far
as
i
know
and
that
is
georgia
against
pennsylvania
and
that
case
was
taken
on
the
express
ground
as
we
understand
it
that
the
district
courts
where
incidentally
georgia
had
not
filed.
none
of
the
district
courts
reason
this
court
could
have
in
personam
jurisdiction
over
all
of
the
defendants
and
that
is
why
you
took
this
as
an
original
jurisdiction
case
saying
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
though
in
other
respects
we
assumed
it
namely
district
court
jurisdiction
would
be
wholly
appropriate.
and
here,
all
of
the
handicaps
of
this
court
as
a
trier
of
fact,
since
you
cannot
listen
to
the
taking
of
evidence
in
the
first
instance,
cited
in
the
dissents
in
the
georgia
case
overwritten
in
georgia
only
for
a
reason
that
is
not
present
here
would
be
before
you.
this
is
not,
as
plaintiffs
appear
to
believe,
a
simple
per
se
antitrust
case
and
the
government
never
contended
when
it
brought
its
own
suit
that
it
was
a
per
se
case.
it's
a
case
that
involves
the
complex
history
of
some
20
years
of
interaction
between
governmental
authorities
and
the
automotive
industry
as
both
of
them
were
gradually
coming
to
realize
the
significant
effects
of
automotive
emissions
on
the
general
air
quality.
and
the
case
has
a
unique
quality
to
it
that
is
going
to
require
extensive
proof
because
of
it's
the
first
case
to
our
knowledge
that
involves
the,
what
economist
called
the
principle
of
externality,
namely
the
incorporation
of
a
feature
in
a
product
such
as
an
automobile
which
is
put
their
for
a
social
or
for
public
purposes
and
which
the
individual
purchaser
of
the
vehicle
does
not
perceive
as
having
any
utility
to
himself
on
his
vehicle
and
will
not
pay
an
additional
price
for
if
you
give
him
a
choice.
in
fact,
in
the
case
of
an
emission
control
apart
from
its
cost
the
purchaser
may
regard
it
as
a
positive
detriment
because
of
its
adverse
effects
on
fuel
equality,
on
idling,
on
heating
up
in
traffic
and
on
cold
starting
and
we
have
filed
with
the
court
since
the
relief
of
course
that
these
plaintiffs
insist
on,
its
retrofit
relief,
we
filed
with
you
yesterday
a
recent
report
submitted
to
the
air
quality
--
air
resources
board
of
california
by
its
staff
and
february
16.
it's
only
six
pages
long
and
i
urge
you
to
look
at
it
because
it
analyzes
all
of
the
available
retrofit
kits
that
have
been
submitted
to
the
state
of
california
which
does
have
a
mandatory
retrofit
law
and
which
will
require
all
of
its
citizens
to
retrofit
when
and
as
the
state
triggers
the
law
by
certifying
a
particular
device
something
after
years
of
that
law
being
on
the
books
the
state
has
not
yet
done.
plaintiffs
have
said
to
you
that
the
problems
that
this
court
faces
with
its
difficulties
as
the
trier
of
fact
could
be
resolved
by
appointing
judge
real
as
your
special
master.
but
this
really
would
not
resolve
the
problems
you
face
as
a
trier
of
fact.
judge
real
sitting
as
special
master
would
--
could
only
recommend
findings
of
fact
to
you
on
which
you
could
would
have
to
make
an
independent
evaluation
and
he
could
only
recommend
to
you
rulings
on
issues
of
law
has
plaintiffs
themselves
seem
to
admit.
he
could
do
far
less
himself
and
he
would
involved
you
much
more
in
interlocutory
and
other
reviews
of
what
he
was
doing
if
he
said
as
your
special
master
then
that
he
and
other
district
judges
sat
as
district
judges.
they
could
dispose
issues
as
district
judges
which
they
could
not
dispose
as
special
master.
for
example,
if
there
were
a
plea
of
the
statute
limitations
answered
by
a
claim
of
fraudulent
concealment
or
motion
to
dismiss
at
the
end
of
the
plaintiffs'
case.
judge
real
or
another
district
judge
could
decide
those
and
the
whole
case
might
be
over
at
that
point.
subject
only
to
appellant
review
and
appellant
review
which
might
never
reach
you,
and
might
be
resolved
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
despite
what
mr.
tausend
has
said
it's
perfectly
possible
that
if
these
cases
are
tried
in
the
district
courts
they
will
ultimately
be
resolved
in
ways
that
never
make
it
necessary
for
this
court,
at
least
to
grant
certiorari
and
review
any
particular
aspect
of
them.
further,
if
judge
real
were
to
function
not
only
as
the
appointee
of
the
multidistrict
panel
in
all
of
these
are
the
cases
but
also
as
your
special
master,
he
might
find
a
conflict
of
interest
in
those
two
responsibilities.
you
might
say,
can
a
master
serve
two
masters?
but
he
is
responsible
to
the
multidistrict
panel
for
the
expeditious
conduct
of
the
pre-trial
proceedings
in
those
other
cases.
supposed
we
were
to
say
to
him
at
some
point
that
we
felt
the
california
case
which
raises
both
damage
issues
still
and
equitable
issues
should
be
tried
first
because
california
was
the
state
with
which
asked
the
automobile
companies
in
the
first
instance
to
appoint
a
committee
and
get
to
work
in
this
area
and
most
of
the
interaction
between
the
industry
and
the
government
took
place
initially
with
the
state
of
california.
and
if
that
case
were
tried
first
and
we
would
erase
that
as
the
case
that
should
be
tried
first,
the
beacon
theaters
problems
would
be
resolved.
how
could
judge
real,
sitting
both
as
your
special
master
in
these
cases
and
as
the
multidistrict
panel
judge
in
the
other
cases,
resolve
that
problem?
he
would
have
to
take
his
orders
from
you
which
might
to
proceed
with
this
case
which
might
be
essentially
incompatible
with
his
other
duties.
furthermore,
you
had
an
experience
with
a
special
master
in
the
only
original
antitrust
case
you
ever
took.
georgia,
if
you'll
recall,
came
to
you
itself
for
urgent
equitable
relief,
that
is
all
you
took
and
you
appointed
a
highly
confident
master.
georgia
thought
probably
also
it
had
a
simple
document
case.
one
that
it
put
into
the
master
in
one
day
yet
it
took
this
very
capable
master,
mr.
lloyd
garrison,
four
years
to
hear
first
the
defendants
proof
of
the
lack
of
conspiracy
and
the
essential
reasonableness
of
what
they
have
done.
and
to
prepare
his
report
and
the
report
itself
was
some
700
odd
pages
alone,
there
were
more
than
15
volumes
of
testimony
and
a
dozen-volume
of
exhibits
which
you
would
have
had
to
review.
you
were
fortunately
spared
that
which
might
have
taken
another
year
because
georgia
itself
voluntarily
dropped
its
case
as
mooted
by
some
pending
icc
proceeding.
so
we
would
say
to
you,
your
honors,
that
the
district
courts
left
to
themselves,
we
believe
and
with
whatever
appropriate
appellate
review
first
the
courts
of
appeal
when
which
you
have
always
relied
in
the
past
in
antitrust
cases
and
which
you
have
been
very
unhappy
to
see
eliminated
from
the
review
of
direct
appeals
by
defendants
in
government
antitrust
cases.
you
could
rely
on
them
to
see
that
the
proceedings
were
going
forward
expeditiously.
judge
real,
i
can
assure
you
sitting
as
the
multidistrict
panel
judge
is
applying
the
lash
very
vigorously
to
all
us
and
the
defendants
in
this
case
far
from
doing
what
mr.
tausend
has
said
have
been
taking
the
initiative
below
in
pretrial
discovery.
we
filed
our
first
wave
discovery
requests
something
like
a
month
before
they
were
required
to
be
filed.
the
plaintiffs
have
not
yet
filed
this.
we
initiated
the
taking
of
depositions
of
some
of
our
older
witnesses.
and
we
have
said
to
judge
real
who
incidentally
has
not
yet
approved
the
december
trial
date
and
has
not
yet
adopted
on
any
permanent
basis
the
plaintiffs
program
but
wants
to
see
the
reaction
of
these
classes
in
municipalities
first.
we
have
said
to
him
that
we
are
prepared
to
go
forward
as
to
accept
any
target
date
for
the
completion
of
pretrial
and
to
go
forward
as
rapidly
as
any
case
involving
20
years
of
history
in
this
rather
abstruse
technology
in
these
relationships
with
various
government
agency
would
permit.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
some
of
the
state
cases
we
would
submit,
mr.
justice
white,
are
sufficiently
different
from
one
another
so
that
it
might
not
be
expeditious
to
put
them
all
together
in
one
big
single
consolidated
trial.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
yes,
mr.
justice
white
we
would,
should
you
take
original
jurisdiction
and
depending
on
whether
the
pretrial
discovery
in
proof
work
out
as
we
believe
it
would
and
the
sharpening
of
the
issues
work
out
as
we
believe
it
would.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
that
is
part
of
the
relief
he
is
asking
mr.
justice
douglas
but
it's
the
only
part
on
which
he
is
concentrating
and
urging
you
to
take
original
jurisdiction
of
the
case.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
pardon?
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
one
thing
in
california,
and
other
in
idaho,
and
other
in
washington?
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
douglas
and
this
was
an
advertent
thing.
the
senate
and
the
house
when
they
passed
the
clean
air
amendments
of
1970
considered
imposing
a
mandatory
retrofit
requirement
and
concluded
that
a
retrofit
program
was
not
manageable
at
the
federal
level,
this
is
at
pages
25
to
32
of
our
--
of
that
same
memorandum,
and
should
be
left
to
the
regions
the
air
quality
regions
and
the
states
which
means
essentially
the
states.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
what
would
actually
happened
mr.
justice
white
as
the
plaintiffs
have
conceded
below
is
that
a
remedy
from
this
court
would
be
worthless
without
the
enactment
of
a
statute
in
each
state
requiring
every
car
owner
to
install
a
retrofit
device
whether
it
was
paid
for
by
him
or
furnished
at
the
cost
of
a
billion
dollars
by
us
and
to
maintain
that
device
there
after.
now
the
interesting
thing
is
and
all
of
this
state
in
--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
all
you
could
do
--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
assuming
you
have
any
power
under
section
16
to
order
the
sort
of
a
remedy
a
retrofit
remedy
today,
all
you
could
do
i
believe,
would
be
the
order
the
installation
of
such
of
the
device
as
the
state
by
legislation
or
regulation
might
or
might
not
require.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
well,
not
only
does
it
have
leeway,
the
states
disagree
very
widely
despite
what
they
say
here
about
whether
there
should
be
retrofit,
the
state
as
i
started
to
say
moment
ago
sir,
have
filed
their
so
called
implementation
plans
with
the
environmental
protection
agency
as
to
what
they
intend
to
do
on
air
quality.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
if
we
file
those
with
you
yesterday
not
a
single
state
mr.
justice
douglas
of
these
34
of
plaintiffs
and
amici
has
said
it
intends
to
adopt
a
retrofit
program.
several
of
them
have
said
that
retrofit
is
unnecessary
or
impracticable
or
would
have
minimal
effect.
these
various
states
that
are
before
you
today
and
we
filed
this
paper
with
you
yesterday
analyzing
this
public
filings
have
all
said
that
they
do
not
intend
to
seek
a
retrofit
program.
the
only
one
that
has
said
the
contrary
is
california
and
california
is
not
seeking
an
original
remedy
from
you
or
in
early
equitable
trial.
it
intends
to
proceed
on
its
claim
for
damage.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
it
would
not
--
it
might
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
in
this
way
that
the
federal
government
decided
that
the
thing
if
the
federal
government
by
which
in
the
sense
you're
a
part
should
concentrate
on
was
emissions
from
new
cars
and
that
the
manufacturers
face
very
substantial
problems
in
working
out
the
technology
and
incurring
the
cost
necessary
to
meet
those
standards.
if
it's
a
still
a
very
near
thing
whether
we
are
going
to
meet
this
new
standards
or
not
but
if
on
top
of
our
obligations
to
meet
standards
on
new
cars,
which
none
of
us
have
yet
figured
out
how
to
do,
this
court
or
any
other
court
should
impose
on
us
a
substantial
retrofit
obligation
amounting
to
some
billions
of
dollars
in
the
production
of
50
million
units
for
that
purpose
it
might
have
a
very
substantial
effect
on
the
epa
program.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
congress
has
said
that
the
question
of
whether
a
car
should
or
should
not
be
retrofitted
are
cars
already
on
the
road
cannot
be
manage
at
the
federal
level
and
should
be
left
to
the
state.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
there
would
be
no
evidence.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
that.
are
you
speaking
with
respect
to
old
cars?
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
well
the
state
could
decide
or
--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
but
idaho
could
also
decide
that
it
does
not
want
dirty
air
quite
that
emissions
from
old
cars
in
idaho
are
not
a
problem.
that
carbon
monoxide
in
idaho
is
not
a
problem,
that
hydrocarbons
in
idaho
are
not
a
problem,
and
that
oxides
of
nitrogen
are
not
a
problem
and
that
is
not
a
useful
expenditure
of
resources
to
cure
air
pollution.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
and
yet
the
very
states,
as
i
said,
that
are
here
before
you
and
in
the
district
court
demanding
this
retrofit
at
defendants'
expense
have
just
filed
plans
with
epa
saying
none
of
them
saying
that
the
intend
of
propose
a
mandatory
retrofit
program
and
yet
this
plaintiffs
have
conceded
below
that
no
remedy
any
court
should
grant
with
work
unless
the
state
pass
such
laws.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
perhaps
so
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
but
i
think
that
very
question
or
that
posture
would
bear
on
the
alleged
urgency
of
this
remedy
and
the
fact
that
the
remedy
may
be
disappearing
unless
the
states
do
something
about
it.
california
which
has
the
most
urgent
problem
has
decided
to
go
ahead
and
rely
on
its
claim
for
damages.
if
the
relief
were
really
that
urgent
other
states
would
do
the
same
and
certainly
this
defendants
should
be
not
be
deprived
of
the
fullest
opportunity
to
prove
(a)
that
there
was
no
antitrust
violation,
(b)
that
if
there
was
one
it
had
no
impact
on
that
particular
state,
and
(c)
even
if
it
did
have
an
impact,
the
air
quality
requirements
in
that
state
were
not
such
as
to
justify
this
drastic
remedy
which
goes
far
beyond
anything
that's
ever
been
called
for
under
section
16.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
defendants
urged
that
this
case
is
governed
by
your
decision
at
the
last
term
in
wyandotte
and
that
in
one
important
sense
it
simpler
than
wyandotte.
in
wyandotte,
you
based
your
decision
on
two
major
grounds
the
availability
of
another
impartial
and
no
less
of
appropriate
forum
even
though
ohio
had
not
filed
suit
in
that
forum
and
as
a
cogent
reason,
a
practical
wisdom
for
declining
jurisdiction
on
the
light
of
your
other
responsibilities
the
possibility
of
imminent
legislative
and
administrative
relief
for
the
factually
and
technically
complex
environmental
problem
they
are
involved.
in
the
present
case,
the
court
need
not
reason
on
the
basis
of
the
hypothetical
availability
of
other
no
less
appropriate
forums
or
on
the
mere
possibility
of
legislative
and
administrative
relief.
in
the
present
cases,
the
same
plaintiffs
states
and
the
amici
states
have
already
filed
essentially
the
same
suits
against
all
the
defendants
and
other
more
appropriate
district
court
forums
where
a
pre-trial
preparation
as
mr.
tausend
told
you
or
actively
proceeding
and
more
over
a
comprehensive
program
on
legislative
and
administrative
relief
or
the
even
more
complex
environmental
problems
here
both
the
federal
and
the
state
level
is
already
an
on-going
fact.
i
would
like
to
ask
the
court
if
it
would
to
look
at
our
supplemental
memorandum
in
our
position
which
is
the
cream-colored
memorandum
filed
on
december
23
and
if
you
will
turn
to
the
appendix
of
that
memorandum,
you
will
see
a
compilation
of
all
of
these
pending
district
court
cases
which
have
now
been
consolidated
for
pre-trial
purposes
--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
i
don't
think
it's
correct
to
say
mr.
justice
douglas
that
it
is
impossible,
it
is
our
belief
number
one
that
the
question
of
whether
these
cases
should
be
transferred
to
a
single
district
for
trial
and
then
consolidated
for
trial
is
a
question
that
can
be
best
evaluated
when
the
pre-trial
proceedings
are
further
along
the
identity
of
the
witnesses
and
the
nature
the
issues
are
better
known,
the
question
of
whether
the
cases
as
they
present
themselves
for
the
different
states
are
essentially
different
cases
in
major
aspects
such
as
the
quality
of
the
air
in
the
given
state
the
impact
of
the
defendants'
activities
on
the
quality
of
the
air
in
that
state
and
the
relationships
that
have
going
on
between
the
regulatory
authorities
and
the
automobile
companies
in
that
state.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
no,
sir.
i
am
suggesting
that
is
an
entirely
appropriate
question
for
the
district
courts
to
resolve
under
the
transfer
powers
and
the
consolidation
powers
when
the
pre-trial
proceedings
are
further
along.
moreover,
if
you
would
look
at
the
appendix,
sir,
you
will
see
that
these
plaintiffs,
most
of
them
after
they
filed
the
single
case
before
you
when
the
time
came
as
mr.
tausend
mentioned
when
they
decided
to
file
district
court
complaints
to
protect
against
a
fairly
remote
statute
of
limitations
possibility.
they
filed
those
complaints
not
in
one
action
as
they
filed
before
you
which
they
were
perfectly
free
to
do.
they
filed
those
complaints
as
you
will
see
on
page
42
of
appendix
a
in
some
12
different
federal
districts,
eight
of
them
as
widely
separate
as
hawaii
and
maine
as
it
happens
elected
to
file
a
single
complaint
in
the
central
district
of
california.
but
the
others
for
reasons
best
known
to
themselves
elected
to
file
in
separate
districts
thus
creating
the
transfer
problem
about
which
they
are
now
complaining.
in
fact,
they
did
this
after
we,
in
our
initial
memorandum
and
opposition
to
the
filing
of
the
complaint
here,
had
said
that
these
courts,
original
jurisdiction
is
not
necessary
if
they
want
to
achieve
their
purpose
of
the
single
trial.
all
they
had
to
do
was
get
together
and
file
a
single
complaint
of
the
same
type
in
a
single
district
court
which
they
did
not
do.
moreover,
even
though
they
failed
to
do
it
the
district
courts
among
them
clearly
have
the
power
to
transfer
these
cases
under
section
1404
and
to
consolidate
them
for
trial
under
rule
42.
should
they
conclude,
despite
the
arguments,
we
may
very
well
make
to
do
contrary
after
the
conclusion
of
the
pre-trial
discovery
that
consolidation
and
transfer
are
not
in
the
interest
of
justice.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
no,
they're
not
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
because
liability
in
a
section
16
action
and
in
a
section
4
action
which
this
plaintiffs
have
also
brought
in
the
district
courts
depends
first
on
the
proof
of
an
antitrust
conspiracy
let
us
say,
and
second
on
the
impact
of
that
conspiracy
on
the
particular
plaintiff.
for
example,
there
is
an
allegation
on
these
complaints
that
the
defendant
conspired
to
delay
the
installation
of
one
particular
retrofit
device
on
vehicles
in
the
state
of
california
for
one
year.
we
would
intend
to
show
not
only
that
we
did
not
so
conspire
but
that
if
we
had,
that
particular
act
could
have
had
no
effect
or
certainly
no
tangible
impact
on
the
quality
of
the
air
or
any
injury
to
the
state
of
hawaii
or
the
state
of
maine
or
any
of
the
other
states
which
were
not
directly
involved
in
that
particular
act.
if
you
will
look
again
at
this
list
of
cases
at
page
42,
many
of
these
cases
in
the
district
courts
in
fact
all
of
those
that
are
brought
by
states
are
contained
the
same
allegations
that
are
contained
in
these
cases
before
you.
but
in
addition
to
that
they
are
class
actions
brought
on
behalf
of
all
the
political
units
in
those
states
and
they
are
also
actions
for
damages
and
we
would
submit
to
you
that
the
district
courts
which
have
those
cases
before
them
are
far
better
able
to
deal
with
the
plaintiffs
present
request
made
to
the
district
court
to
drop
their
damage
claims
and
to
deal
with
the
question
of
how
the
dropping
of
those
claims
is
to
be
resolved
among
the
various
members
of
their
classes
and
to
how
the
question
of
dropping
the
damage
claims
in
some
but
not
all
of
the
state
cases
because
california
has
declined
to
drop
its
damage
claim
and
has
declined
to
seek
this
early
equity
trial
how
those
problems
are
to
be
resolved.
first,
to
make
sure
that
the
dismissal
of
this
class
action
complaints
below
is
properly
approved
by
the
court
and
second,
how
any
jury
trial
or
right
to
jury
trial
issues
under
beacon
theaters
are
to
be
resolved.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
all
of
them
plead
parens
patriae
claims
including
the
ones
before
you.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
it's
not
a
class
action
before
you.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
that
is
correct
and
remember
of
course
that
you
have
before
you
only
18
of
the
states
whereas
the
district
court
has
before
it
some
36
states.
one
of
which
at
least
has
said
specifically
it
does
not
intend
to
drop
its
damage
claim
and
does
not
intend
to
seek
this
early
equity
trial
therefore
raising
this
set
of
be
beacon
theaters
problems
that
only
the
district
court,
we
believe,
can
resolve
since
it
has
all
these
cases
before
it.
it
has
all
the
classes
and
it
can
arrive
at
the
proper
resolution
of
which
cases
should
be
tried
first.
i
want
to
say
in
that
connection
in
the
light
of
mr.
tausend's
comments
first
that
what
he
quoted
from
my
remarks
below
before
judge
real
dealt
essentially
with
the
question
of
when
transfer
and
consolidation
where
right
issues
for
consideration
and
not
with
the
question
of
essentially
of
power
in
the
district
courts
to
accomplish
those
two
things
whenever
that
might
be
required.
now
--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
i
say
only
mr.
justice
white
that
these
plaintiffs
have
pleaded
their
case
as
a
parens
patriae
claim
for
the
injunctive
relief
they
seek
in
this
court,
whether
the
parens
patriae
point
is
significant
and
that,
i
have
no
idea.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
this
i
take
it
is
the
issue
you
have
before
you
and
hawaii
case
but
their
claim
is
that
on
behalf
of
all
the
citizens
of
their
state
they
are
seeking
the
injunctive
relief
which
they
claim
to
be
necessary
to
improve
the
quality
of
the
air
in
their
state
--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
--
for
an
antitrust
violation.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
no,
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
i
am
not
making
an
issue
of
the
fact
that
they
have
included
the
parens
patriae
claim
and
i
don't
know
that
it
is
significant
to
your
question
of
whether
that
you
should
accept?
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
well,
i
believed
that
they
are
suing
as
states
and
as
parens
patriae.
they
say
they
bring
in
this
action
in
their
capacity
as
parens
patriae,
etcetera,
etcetera,
etcetera
and
as
proprietors,
state
lands,
properties
and
resources.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
no
sir
and
in
fact
we
do
not
challenge
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
courts
in
anyway
these
defendants
are
suable
and
virtually
any
district,
they
have
not
contested
the
suits
pending
in
any
state
--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
we
of
course,
we
don't
contest
your
jurisdiction
sir.
the
--
not
only
is
the
district
court
a
perfectly
appropriate
forum
and
equally
appropriate
forum
field.
we
submit,
your
honors,
that
the
district
court
is
a
more
appropriate
forum
even
though
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
for
us
for
you
to
reach
that
level
of
proof.
you
have
only
taken
one
original
antitrust
case
so
far
as
i
know
and
that
is
georgia
against
pennsylvania
and
that
case
was
taken
on
the
express
ground
as
we
understand
it
that
the
district
courts
where
incidentally
georgia
had
not
filed.
none
of
the
district
courts
reason
this
court
could
have
in
personam
jurisdiction
over
all
of
the
defendants
and
that
is
why
you
took
this
as
an
original
jurisdiction
case
saying
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
though
in
other
respects
we
assumed
it
namely
district
court
jurisdiction
would
be
wholly
appropriate.
and
here,
all
of
the
handicaps
of
this
court
as
a
trier
of
fact,
since
you
cannot
listen
to
the
taking
of
evidence
in
the
first
instance,
cited
in
the
dissents
in
the
georgia
case
overwritten
in
georgia
only
for
a
reason
that
is
not
present
here
would
be
before
you.
this
is
not,
as
plaintiffs
appear
to
believe,
a
simple
per
se
antitrust
case
and
the
government
never
contended
when
it
brought
its
own
suit
that
it
was
a
per
se
case.
it's
a
case
that
involves
the
complex
history
of
some
20
years
of
interaction
between
governmental
authorities
and
the
automotive
industry
as
both
of
them
were
gradually
coming
to
realize
the
significant
effects
of
automotive
emissions
on
the
general
air
quality.
and
the
case
has
a
unique
quality
to
it
that
is
going
to
require
extensive
proof
because
of
it's
the
first
case
to
our
knowledge
that
involves
the,
what
economist
called
the
principle
of
externality,
namely
the
incorporation
of
a
feature
in
a
product
such
as
an
automobile
which
is
put
their
for
a
social
or
for
public
purposes
and
which
the
individual
purchaser
of
the
vehicle
does
not
perceive
as
having
any
utility
to
himself
on
his
vehicle
and
will
not
pay
an
additional
price
for
if
you
give
him
a
choice.
in
fact,
in
the
case
of
an
emission
control
apart
from
its
cost
the
purchaser
may
regard
it
as
a
positive
detriment
because
of
its
adverse
effects
on
fuel
equality,
on
idling,
on
heating
up
in
traffic
and
on
cold
starting
and
we
have
filed
with
the
court
since
the
relief
of
course
that
these
plaintiffs
insist
on,
its
retrofit
relief,
we
filed
with
you
yesterday
a
recent
report
submitted
to
the
air
quality
--
air
resources
board
of
california
by
its
staff
and
february
16.
it's
only
six
pages
long
and
i
urge
you
to
look
at
it
because
it
analyzes
all
of
the
available
retrofit
kits
that
have
been
submitted
to
the
state
of
california
which
does
have
a
mandatory
retrofit
law
and
which
will
require
all
of
its
citizens
to
retrofit
when
and
as
the
state
triggers
the
law
by
certifying
a
particular
device
something
after
years
of
that
law
being
on
the
books
the
state
has
not
yet
done.
plaintiffs
have
said
to
you
that
the
problems
that
this
court
faces
with
its
difficulties
as
the
trier
of
fact
could
be
resolved
by
appointing
judge
real
as
your
special
master.
but
this
really
would
not
resolve
the
problems
you
face
as
a
trier
of
fact.
judge
real
sitting
as
special
master
would
--
could
only
recommend
findings
of
fact
to
you
on
which
you
could
would
have
to
make
an
independent
evaluation
and
he
could
only
recommend
to
you
rulings
on
issues
of
law
has
plaintiffs
themselves
seem
to
admit.
he
could
do
far
less
himself
and
he
would
involved
you
much
more
in
interlocutory
and
other
reviews
of
what
he
was
doing
if
he
said
as
your
special
master
then
that
he
and
other
district
judges
sat
as
district
judges.
they
could
dispose
issues
as
district
judges
which
they
could
not
dispose
as
special
master.
for
example,
if
there
were
a
plea
of
the
statute
limitations
answered
by
a
claim
of
fraudulent
concealment
or
motion
to
dismiss
at
the
end
of
the
plaintiffs'
case.
judge
real
or
another
district
judge
could
decide
those
and
the
whole
case
might
be
over
at
that
point.
subject
only
to
appellant
review
and
appellant
review
which
might
never
reach
you,
and
might
be
resolved
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
despite
what
mr.
tausend
has
said
it's
perfectly
possible
that
if
these
cases
are
tried
in
the
district
courts
they
will
ultimately
be
resolved
in
ways
that
never
make
it
necessary
for
this
court,
at
least
to
grant
certiorari
and
review
any
particular
aspect
of
them.
further,
if
judge
real
were
to
function
not
only
as
the
appointee
of
the
multidistrict
panel
in
all
of
these
are
the
cases
but
also
as
your
special
master,
he
might
find
a
conflict
of
interest
in
those
two
responsibilities.
you
might
say,
can
a
master
serve
two
masters?
but
he
is
responsible
to
the
multidistrict
panel
for
the
expeditious
conduct
of
the
pre-trial
proceedings
in
those
other
cases.
supposed
we
were
to
say
to
him
at
some
point
that
we
felt
the
california
case
which
raises
both
damage
issues
still
and
equitable
issues
should
be
tried
first
because
california
was
the
state
with
which
asked
the
automobile
companies
in
the
first
instance
to
appoint
a
committee
and
get
to
work
in
this
area
and
most
of
the
interaction
between
the
industry
and
the
government
took
place
initially
with
the
state
of
california.
and
if
that
case
were
tried
first
and
we
would
erase
that
as
the
case
that
should
be
tried
first,
the
beacon
theaters
problems
would
be
resolved.
how
could
judge
real,
sitting
both
as
your
special
master
in
these
cases
and
as
the
multidistrict
panel
judge
in
the
other
cases,
resolve
that
problem?
he
would
have
to
take
his
orders
from
you
which
might
to
proceed
with
this
case
which
might
be
essentially
incompatible
with
his
other
duties.
furthermore,
you
had
an
experience
with
a
special
master
in
the
only
original
antitrust
case
you
ever
took.
georgia,
if
you'll
recall,
came
to
you
itself
for
urgent
equitable
relief,
that
is
all
you
took
and
you
appointed
a
highly
confident
master.
georgia
thought
probably
also
it
had
a
simple
document
case.
one
that
it
put
into
the
master
in
one
day
yet
it
took
this
very
capable
master,
mr.
lloyd
garrison,
four
years
to
hear
first
the
defendants
proof
of
the
lack
of
conspiracy
and
the
essential
reasonableness
of
what
they
have
done.
and
to
prepare
his
report
and
the
report
itself
was
some
700
odd
pages
alone,
there
were
more
than
15
volumes
of
testimony
and
a
dozen-volume
of
exhibits
which
you
would
have
had
to
review.
you
were
fortunately
spared
that
which
might
have
taken
another
year
because
georgia
itself
voluntarily
dropped
its
case
as
mooted
by
some
pending
icc
proceeding.
so
we
would
say
to
you,
your
honors,
that
the
district
courts
left
to
themselves,
we
believe
and
with
whatever
appropriate
appellate
review
first
the
courts
of
appeal
when
which
you
have
always
relied
in
the
past
in
antitrust
cases
and
which
you
have
been
very
unhappy
to
see
eliminated
from
the
review
of
direct
appeals
by
defendants
in
government
antitrust
cases.
you
could
rely
on
them
to
see
that
the
proceedings
were
going
forward
expeditiously.
judge
real,
i
can
assure
you
sitting
as
the
multidistrict
panel
judge
is
applying
the
lash
very
vigorously
to
all
us
and
the
defendants
in
this
case
far
from
doing
what
mr.
tausend
has
said
have
been
taking
the
initiative
below
in
pretrial
discovery.
we
filed
our
first
wave
discovery
requests
something
like
a
month
before
they
were
required
to
be
filed.
the
plaintiffs
have
not
yet
filed
this.
we
initiated
the
taking
of
depositions
of
some
of
our
older
witnesses.
and
we
have
said
to
judge
real
who
incidentally
has
not
yet
approved
the
december
trial
date
and
has
not
yet
adopted
on
any
permanent
basis
the
plaintiffs
program
but
wants
to
see
the
reaction
of
these
classes
in
municipalities
first.
we
have
said
to
him
that
we
are
prepared
to
go
forward
as
to
accept
any
target
date
for
the
completion
of
pretrial
and
to
go
forward
as
rapidly
as
any
case
involving
20
years
of
history
in
this
rather
abstruse
technology
in
these
relationships
with
various
government
agency
would
permit.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
some
of
the
state
cases
we
would
submit,
mr.
justice
white,
are
sufficiently
different
from
one
another
so
that
it
might
not
be
expeditious
to
put
them
all
together
in
one
big
single
consolidated
trial.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
yes,
mr.
justice
white
we
would,
should
you
take
original
jurisdiction
and
depending
on
whether
the
pretrial
discovery
in
proof
work
out
as
we
believe
it
would
and
the
sharpening
of
the
issues
work
out
as
we
believe
it
would.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
that
is
part
of
the
relief
he
is
asking
mr.
justice
douglas
but
it's
the
only
part
on
which
he
is
concentrating
and
urging
you
to
take
original
jurisdiction
of
the
case.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
pardon?
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
one
thing
in
california,
and
other
in
idaho,
and
other
in
washington?
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
douglas
and
this
was
an
advertent
thing.
the
senate
and
the
house
when
they
passed
the
clean
air
amendments
of
1970
considered
imposing
a
mandatory
retrofit
requirement
and
concluded
that
a
retrofit
program
was
not
manageable
at
the
federal
level,
this
is
at
pages
25
to
32
of
our
--
of
that
same
memorandum,
and
should
be
left
to
the
regions
the
air
quality
regions
and
the
states
which
means
essentially
the
states.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
what
would
actually
happened
mr.
justice
white
as
the
plaintiffs
have
conceded
below
is
that
a
remedy
from
this
court
would
be
worthless
without
the
enactment
of
a
statute
in
each
state
requiring
every
car
owner
to
install
a
retrofit
device
whether
it
was
paid
for
by
him
or
furnished
at
the
cost
of
a
billion
dollars
by
us
and
to
maintain
that
device
there
after.
now
the
interesting
thing
is
and
all
of
this
state
in
--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
all
you
could
do
--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
assuming
you
have
any
power
under
section
16
to
order
the
sort
of
a
remedy
a
retrofit
remedy
today,
all
you
could
do
i
believe,
would
be
the
order
the
installation
of
such
of
the
device
as
the
state
by
legislation
or
regulation
might
or
might
not
require.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
well,
not
only
does
it
have
leeway,
the
states
disagree
very
widely
despite
what
they
say
here
about
whether
there
should
be
retrofit,
the
state
as
i
started
to
say
moment
ago
sir,
have
filed
their
so
called
implementation
plans
with
the
environmental
protection
agency
as
to
what
they
intend
to
do
on
air
quality.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
if
we
file
those
with
you
yesterday
not
a
single
state
mr.
justice
douglas
of
these
34
of
plaintiffs
and
amici
has
said
it
intends
to
adopt
a
retrofit
program.
several
of
them
have
said
that
retrofit
is
unnecessary
or
impracticable
or
would
have
minimal
effect.
these
various
states
that
are
before
you
today
and
we
filed
this
paper
with
you
yesterday
analyzing
this
public
filings
have
all
said
that
they
do
not
intend
to
seek
a
retrofit
program.
the
only
one
that
has
said
the
contrary
is
california
and
california
is
not
seeking
an
original
remedy
from
you
or
in
early
equitable
trial.
it
intends
to
proceed
on
its
claim
for
damage.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
it
would
not
--
it
might
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
in
this
way
that
the
federal
government
decided
that
the
thing
if
the
federal
government
by
which
in
the
sense
you're
a
part
should
concentrate
on
was
emissions
from
new
cars
and
that
the
manufacturers
face
very
substantial
problems
in
working
out
the
technology
and
incurring
the
cost
necessary
to
meet
those
standards.
if
it's
a
still
a
very
near
thing
whether
we
are
going
to
meet
this
new
standards
or
not
but
if
on
top
of
our
obligations
to
meet
standards
on
new
cars,
which
none
of
us
have
yet
figured
out
how
to
do,
this
court
or
any
other
court
should
impose
on
us
a
substantial
retrofit
obligation
amounting
to
some
billions
of
dollars
in
the
production
of
50
million
units
for
that
purpose
it
might
have
a
very
substantial
effect
on
the
epa
program.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
congress
has
said
that
the
question
of
whether
a
car
should
or
should
not
be
retrofitted
are
cars
already
on
the
road
cannot
be
manage
at
the
federal
level
and
should
be
left
to
the
state.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
there
would
be
no
evidence.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
that.
are
you
speaking
with
respect
to
old
cars?
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
well
the
state
could
decide
or
--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
but
idaho
could
also
decide
that
it
does
not
want
dirty
air
quite
that
emissions
from
old
cars
in
idaho
are
not
a
problem.
that
carbon
monoxide
in
idaho
is
not
a
problem,
that
hydrocarbons
in
idaho
are
not
a
problem,
and
that
oxides
of
nitrogen
are
not
a
problem
and
that
is
not
a
useful
expenditure
of
resources
to
cure
air
pollution.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
and
yet
the
very
states,
as
i
said,
that
are
here
before
you
and
in
the
district
court
demanding
this
retrofit
at
defendants'
expense
have
just
filed
plans
with
epa
saying
none
of
them
saying
that
the
intend
of
propose
a
mandatory
retrofit
program
and
yet
this
plaintiffs
have
conceded
below
that
no
remedy
any
court
should
grant
with
work
unless
the
state
pass
such
laws.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
perhaps
so
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
but
i
think
that
very
question
or
that
posture
would
bear
on
the
alleged
urgency
of
this
remedy
and
the
fact
that
the
remedy
may
be
disappearing
unless
the
states
do
something
about
it.
california
which
has
the
most
urgent
problem
has
decided
to
go
ahead
and
rely
on
its
claim
for
damages.
if
the
relief
were
really
that
urgent
other
states
would
do
the
same
and
certainly
this
defendants
should
be
not
be
deprived
of
the
fullest
opportunity
to
prove
(a)
that
there
was
no
antitrust
violation,
(b)
that
if
there
was
one
it
had
no
impact
on
that
particular
state,
and
(c)
even
if
it
did
have
an
impact,
the
air
quality
requirements
in
that
state
were
not
such
as
to
justify
this
drastic
remedy
which
goes
far
beyond
anything
that's
ever
been
called
for
under
section
16.
