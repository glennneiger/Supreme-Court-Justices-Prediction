mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
mr.
chief
justice,
my
name
is
fredric
tausend.
i
am
a
special
assistant
attorney
general
for
the
state
of
washington.
i
could
introduce
the
argument
now
if
that’s
satisfactory
to
mr.
cutler.
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
i
would
divide
my
argument
in
half
but
i’d
be
willing
to
do
it.
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
antitrust
action
brought
by
18
states
against
the
four
major
american
automobile
manufacturers
and
their
trade
association,
charging
the
defendants
with
violating
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
we
are
here
on
the
motion
of
the
plaintiff
states
to
file
this
action
as
an
original
action.
and
we
are
joined
in
this
request
by
18
additional
states
in
the
city
of
new
york
as
amici
curiae
who
have
indicated
to
this
court
that
they
would
intervene
in
this
action
for
a
total
of
36
states
in
the
city
of
new
york
if
this
court
exercises
its
original
jurisdiction.
now,
the
complaint
which
we
proposed
to
file
charges
the
defendants
with
a
section
1
sherman
act
conspiracy
lasting
over
15
years
from
1953
until
at
least
1968.
the
purpose
in
effect
of
which
was
to
delay,
prevent
and
retard
the
development,
the
manufacture
and
finally
the
installation
of
pollution
control
equipment
for
their
automobiles.
i
would
like
if
i
could,
to
flash
out
the
allegations
of
this
compliant
with
reference
to
some
of
the
documents
which
have
been
obtained
and
reviewed
by
us
in
connection
with
a
related
multi-district
proceeding
in
los
angeles
to
which
i
will
refer
shortly.
mainly
for
the
purpose
of
assuring
this
court
that
this
is
not
a
case
where
we
have
serious
allegations
of
illegal
activity
but
no
evidence
to
support
them.
but
a
protective
order
entered
in
mdl
31
prevents
me
from
giving
such
examples.
suffice
it
to
say,
that
the
charges
on
which
our
compliant
is
based
are
identical
to
a
civil
action
filed
by
the
justice
department
in
january
1969,
settled
in
october
1969
by
consent
decreed.
the
injunctive
relief
obtained
by
the
government
in
that
decree
is
entirely
preventative.
it
seeks
to
prevent
the
alleged
conspiracy
from
continuing
and
so
it
ended
the
alleged
conspiracy
and
to
quote
former
attorney
general
mitchell
as
we
do
as
page
18
of
our
opening
brief,
“it
encouraged
immediate
action
by
the
automobile
companies
to
solve
the
problem.
however,
it
did
not
attempt
to
repair
the
damage
which
continues
to
this
day
and
in
the
future
to
be
inflicted
by
the
cars
manufactured
as
a
result
of
the
alleged
conspiracy.”
and
this
is
where
the
36
states
and
the
other
governmental
bodies
have
taken
up
to
cajoles
with
this
action.
this
act
--
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
retrofit.
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
the
basic
relief
that
we’re
seeking,
we
ask
for
some
other
equitable
relief
but
the
basic
principle
thing
we’re
seeking
is
a
mandatory
or
reparative
injunction
which
would
require
the
installation
on
all
cars
manufactured
as
a
result
of
the
conspiracy
and
for
convenience
we
talked
about
pre
1968
cars.
that
might
be
the
first
cutoff
date
with
effective
pollution
control
equipment
and
that
is
called
“retrofit.”
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
the
aggregate
liability
of
the
users,
you
mean
the
people
who
drive
the
automobiles?
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
i
suppose
we
are
polluting
the
air,
your
honor.
i
don’t
think
the
users
have
violated
or
charged
with
violating
the
antitrust
laws
and
we’re
not
here
on
a
nuisance
count
and
as
the
court,
i
trust
to
where
in
our
latest
brief,
we
have
stricken
count
iii
and
we’ve
done
it
because
we
want
to
get
the
speediest
possible
remedy.
the
retrofit
remedy
is
only
a
viable
remedy
if
it
can
be
applied
quickly.
and
in
count
iii,
which
we
put
in
because
we
needed
it
as
a
backup
town,
we
didn’t
know
what
kind
of
an
antitrust
case
we
have.
we
haven’t
seen
any
documents
when
we
file
this.
now
appears
to
us
to
be
ballast
and
we’ve
thrown
it
over
board
to
speed
up
the
case
and
get
to
the
end
of
our
voyage
because,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
retrofit
remedy
and
i
can’t
give
you
an
actual
calendar
date
but
i
can
predict
reasonably
closely.
we
have
asked
in
the
multi-district
proceedings
and
i
will
probably
have
to
come
to
those
tomorrow
for
a
december
1972
target
trial
date
and
judge
real
on
those
proceedings
which
are
consolidated
on
1407
before
him
and
not
all
before
him
filed
in
this
court.
judge
real
has
indicated
that
as
a
practical
matter
he
is
geared
to
discovery
to
december
1972
target
trial
date
on
equitable
claims,
equitable
relief
only,
and
if
we
can
get
that
or
reasonably
near
that
then
retrofit
remedy
retains
its
viability.
but
as
the
defendants
have
pointed
out
in
there
briefs
at
every
occasion
and
as
we
point
out
in
our
source
of
law
brief
in
the
conclusion,
these
pre
1968
cars
of
which
they
are
now
50
million
approximately
in
the
united
states
are
leaving
the
road
at
the
rate
of
seven
or
eight
million
cars
a
year
and
that
rate
maybe
accelerated.
now,
they’re
leaving
the
pollution
in
the
air
but
they’re
leaving
the
road
and
then
say,
two
years
or
three
years,
there
will
be
fewer
and
fewer
of
these
cars,
the
air
will
have
been
polluted
and
the
res
to
which
the
equitable
remedy
could
attach
the
possibility
if
this
defendants
has
alleged
did
violate
the
antitrust
laws,
the
possibility
of
making
them
supply
the
equitable
remedy
of
which
best
gets
the
wrong
alleged
is
reduced
and
even
eliminated
and
that
is
why
--
because
in
this
case
we
see
--
its
one
of
those
rare
cases
where
the
best
remedy
is
the
simplest
remedy.
it’s
direct,
it
cleans
the
air,
it
doesn’t
compensate
in
money.
the
defendants
themselves
as
we
point
as
--
as
we
point
out
at
page
21
of
our
choice
of
law
brief
have
indicated,
number
one,
that
effective
devices
do
exist.
both
chrysler
and
delco
have
such
devices
and
i’ve
talked
about
them
and
as
we
also
point
out
at
page
21
of
that
choice
of
law
brief,
mr.
delorean,
a
vice
president
of
general
motors
riding
in
look
magazine
in
may
of
1970
said,
that
--
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
our
choice
of
law
brief,
your
honor
is
gray,
the
finest
memorandum
and
the
quote
i
have
is
on
page
21,
right
at
the
bottom,
john
delorean,
vice
president
of
general
motors,
in
charge
of
chevrolet
division,
what
magazine?
page
57,
august
25,
1970,
said,
“if
every
car
produced
before
1969
had
available
retrofit
devices,
our
air
would
be
as
pure
as
it
was
30
years
ago.”
now,
allowing
for
some
exaggeration,
maybe
30%
if
it
could
be
as
pure
as
it
was
20
years
ago
and
if
they
did
violate
the
antitrust
laws
as
alleged
and
if
we
can
prove
that
then
it
seems
to
me
the
remedy
most
clearly
directed
to
the
wrong
is
available
if
it
can
be
obtained
quickly
enough.
i
think
before
i
talk
about
further
the
remedy
and
the
reason
why
we
need
original
jurisdiction,
i
would
meet
briefly
the
court’s
request
to
talk
about
the
applicable
sustentative
law
and
that
is
really
easy
because
the
question
is
largely
moot.
as
i
pointed
out,
count
iii
has
been
stricken
and
i
gave
you
the
reasons.
count
ii
is
a
common
law
antitrust
account.
and
number
one,
that
was
included,
i
think
as
a
very
remote
hedge
against
the
possibility,
the
court
of
equity
would
as
the
defendants
argue
it
should
adopt
an
interpretation
of
the
section
16
of
the
clayton
act,
that
section
16
clayton
act,
equity
court
doesn’t
have
the
full
powers
that
a
common
law
equity
or
federal
equity
court
has.
in
any
event,
we’re
in
total
agreement
with
mr.
cutler
on
this.
his
brief
states
that
is
an
independent
count
based
on
state
common
law
and
we
agree.
we
don’t
think
the
counts
are
going
to
be
reduced
and
i
really
think
that
that
for
this
case
resolves
the
question
of
choice
of
law.
now,
i
would
like
to
come
to
the
reasons
why
we’re
urging
this
court
to
accept
original
jurisdiction
of
this
case.
we
recognized,
although
defendants
suggests
we
don’t,
the
burden
that
an
original
action
case
puts
on
the
court,
we
believe
that
this
case
fully
satisfies
the
standards
laid
down
by
this
court
in
wyandotte
and
in
georgia
versus
the
pennsylvania
railroad
company.
there
simply
is
no
state
forum
to
which
this
cost
could
be
remitted
as
was
the
case
with
the
state
court
of
ohio
in
wyandotte.
this
is
a
federal
antitrust
case
and
we
also
believe
there
is
no
single
federal
court
and
i
want
to
emphasize
single
federal
court
because
we
believe
in
the
interest
of
the
burden
on
the
judiciary
system,
in
the
interest
of
at
least
the
plaintiff
states
because
the
defendants
want
a
different
result
that
this
case
should
be
tried
in
a
single
court,
the
equitable
claims
of
the
public
body
plaintiffs
we
believe
can
and
should
be
tried
in
a
single
federal
court.
now,
the
obvious
question
occurs,
why
not
the
central
district
of
los
angeles
where
judge
real
is
presiding
as
a
district
judge.
and
i
think
that
the
answer
is
that
the
defendants
won’t
let
us
and
if
they’re
in
the
position
to
keep
us
from
that
single
trial
there
long
enough
to
make
the
equitable
remedy
no
longer
viable.
so,
we
have
a
consideration
of
time,
a
speedy
remedy
in
order
to
make
the
equitable
relief
viable
and
a
consideration
of
place,
a
single
court.
you
see,
in
the
multi-district
proceedings
in
los
angeles,
only
nine
states
actually
filed
in
los
angeles,
two
actions.
the
state
of
california,
the
state
of
washington
and
seven
states
has
filed
on
a
consolidated
action
with
us.
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday
afternoon
i
told
you
what
this
case
was
about.
this
morning,
i
hope
to
persuade
you
to
exercise
your
discretion
to
accept
this
case
as
an
original
action.
the
states
who
are
plaintiffs
in
the
amici
seek
two
things.
one,
a
single
unified
trial
of
the
antitrust
for
equitable
relief
only,
and
two,
a
speedy
resolution
of
this
litigation
so
that
what
now
appears
to
be
the
most
adequate
equitable
remedy
namely
retrofit
of
pre
1968
cars
at
the
expense
of
the
defendants
can
remain
a
viable
possibility
for
the
court
to
administer
if
it
sees
fit
to
do
so
at
the
conclusion
of
the
case.
under
the
standards
which
this
court
lay
down
in
wyandotte
and
georgia,
you
must
been
exercising
your
discretion
ascertain
first
if
there
was
an
alternative
forum
to
which
this
case
may
be
remitted
in
the
interest
of
convenience,
efficiency,
and
justice.
now
clearly
because
this
is
a
sherman
act,
section
1
case,
that
forum
must
be
a
federal
one.
the
appellant's
alternative
forum
that
comes
to
mind
is
the
district
court
in
the
central
district
of
california
at
los
angeles,
the
multidistrict
court.
judge
real
has
served
almost
two
years
as
the
1407
transferee
judge.
he
is
familiar
with
many
of
the
facts
in
this
litigation
in
that
capacity.
he
has
presided
over
extensive
pre-trial
hearings
i
believe
there
have
been
at
least
six.
he
has
attended
portions
of
a
two
depositions
of
officers
to
the
defendants
that
have
been
taking
to
date.
he
has
read
some
of
the
documents
which
were
submitted
to
him
in
a
brief
under
seal
and
he
has
made
it
clear
by
adopting
the
plaintiff
proposed
discovery
and
trial
preparation
schedule
that
under
his
direction
these
cases
could
be
ready
to
go
to
trial
in
december
1972.
but
standing
ultimately
in
the
way
of
that
resolution,
a
single
trial
in
december
1972
on
the
equitable
issues
are
these
defendants.
as
i
pointed
that
yesterday,
34
of
the
governmental
cases
were
brought
in
districts
other
than
central
district
of
california,
23
separate
districts
as
a
matter
of
fact.
so
to
achieve
a
single
trial
at
the
district
court
level
there
would
have
to
be
transfers
to
los
angeles
of
all
34
cases
under
28
usc
section
1404.
and
the
defendants
have
announced
time
and
again
that
they
would
resist
such
to
transfers
and
such
a
consolidated
trial.
at
page
4
of
their
supplemental
brief
which
is
the
cream-colored
brief,
the
next
to
the
last
brief
they
filed
in
this
action.
they
assert
that
the
joint
trial
was
not
feasible,
not
feasible.
and
at
the
proceeding
before
judge
real
in
los
angeles,
a
week
ago
thursday,
the
defendants
indicated
just
how
vigorously
they
will
resist
such
a
transfer
on
both
substantive
and
procedural
grounds
if
judge
real
attempts
to
go
ahead
with
it.
i
have
submitted
the
transcripts
of
those
proceedings
such
an
the
appendix
to
our
brief
and
i
am
going
to
quote
for
mr.
cutler,
at
page
51
of
the
transcript.
i
am
going
a
quote
a
few
remarks
and
if
the
court
has
the
transcript
and
would
like
to
see
the
entire
context
of
those
remarks
that
mr.
cutler
made,
i'll
invite
your
attention
to
page
51.
mr.
cutler
told
the
court
and
i
quote,
"i
think
we
would
have
to
say
that
any
decision
at
this
point
in
favor
of
transfer
and
consolidation
is
something
which
we
would
feel
bound
to
seek
review."
and
then
said
mr.
cutler
everything
would
be
help
up
while
that
was
being
resolved.
now,
mr.
cutler's
thrust
has
two
points.
one,
very
clearly
the
defendants
intend
if
they
can
to
hold
up
everything
attacking
this
transfers
and
the
second
point
is
that
they
will
seek
with
you
which
means
that
ultimately
this
case
is
going
to
reach
this
court
and
probably
more
than
once
because
the
defendants
have
already
taken
and
interlocutory
appeal
from
judge
real's
order
denying
their
motion
to
dismiss.
the
interlocutory
appeal
your
honors
was
certified
in
november
1970.
the
case
was
finally
argued
in
the
ninth
circuit
on
january
1972,
it
is
now
subjudicy
and
certiorari
i
believe
as
certain.
so
i
think
the
defendants
have
made
it
clear
that
they're
not
going
to
let
this
court
escape
the
burden
of
this
litigation.
so
the
question
then
is
i
believe,
would
the
burden
imposed
by
accepting
original
jurisdiction
as
we
urge
this
court
to
do,
especially
where
the
master
can
be
a
federal
district
judge
who
is
totally
familiar
with
the
case
and
was
indicated
that
but
for
the
legal
obstacles
which
the
defendants
are
raising,
he
would
most
probably
be
prepared
to
go
to
trial
on
the
equitable
claims
on
december
1972.
is
that
burden
really
greater
than
the
burden
imposed
by
the
persistent,
excuse
me,
by
the
persistent
threat
from
the
defendants
on
what
can
only
be
characterized
as
protracted
in
piecemeal
litigation.
and
beyond
the
burden
that
would
be
imposed
on
this
court
is
the
burden
which
would
be
imposed
on
the
entire
federal
judicial
system
if
the
defendants
succeed
on
delaying
the
trial
to
a
point
where
the
possibility
of
equitable
relief
through
retrofit
is
no
longer
a
viable
one
because
of
the
delays
in
time
and
the
cars
leaving
the
road
at
the
rate
of
8
to
10
million
a
year
as
it
accelerates
as
i
explained
to
the
court
yesterday.
because
of
that
point,
at
some
point
on
the
future
money
damages
would
then
be
the
only
sensible
recourse
of
the
states
and
the
difficulties
and
complexities
of
this
case
will
be
every
bit
as
great
and
perhaps
greater
than
the
multidistrict
panel
warned
up
when
it
assigned
these
cases
to
judge
real.
now
the
defendants
also
will
be
greatly
burden
by
multiple
jury
trials
and
diverse
appeals
but
apparently
they
are
willing
to
bear
this
burden
in
order
to
avoid
paying
in
this
way
for
their
sherman
act
violations.
it
is
to
avoid
these
burdens
on
the
court
on
the
federal
judiciary
on
the
34
states
and
new
york
and
to
obtain
an
early
end
to
the
litigation
and
to
preserve
the
possibility
of
retrofit
relief
at
the
defendants
expense
as
a
viable
remedy
for
the
wrong
alleged
that
we
urged
this
court
now
to
accept
the
original
jurisdiction
of
this
case,
appoint
judge
real
as
your
master
and
let
us
proceed
the
trial
in
december
1972,
that
is
my
argument.
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
yes,
i
do
your
honor.
your
honors,
this
is
not
an
air
pollution
case.
this
is
not
retrofit
case.
this
is
not
a
nuisance
case.
it
is
an
antitrust
case
for
equitable
relief
only
and
it
is
true
that
we
have
emphasized
in
urging
you
to
accept
the
original
jurisdiction
the
widely
possibility
of
seeking
as
we
do
now
and
seeking
at
the
end
of
the
trial
retrofit
relief
for
pre-1968
cars
as
the
most
adequate
remedy
if
we
proved
the
antitrust
wrong.
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
well
--
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
yes,
we
are
not
seeking
preventive
relief
mr.
justice
white.
we
are
not
trying
to
collaterally
supplement
--
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
the
other
possibility
as
we
hold
out
are
possibility
of
additional
devices
on
new
cars
if
the
technology
of
speed
or
an
accelerated
research
program
which
we're
not
particularly
emphasizing
at
this
times
and
might
raise
additional
problems
but
we
do
want
to
keep
the
equitable
relief
flexible
although
we
think
and
we're
pretty
sure
that
the
partly
because
of
what
the
defendants
have
said
and
what
technology
seems
to
be
producing
that
the
retrofit
device
making
those
cars
manufactured
doing
the
period
of
the
conspiracy
clean
cars
which
they
would
have
been,
but
for
the
antitrust
conspiracy
is
the
most
fitted
device.
but
i
want
to
make
clear
that
we're
not
asking
this
court
today
to
decide
that
issue.
we're
asking
this
court
because
we
think
it
would
be
pre-mature.
it
came
before
judge
real
and
he
said
it's
pre-mature.
and
we
quoted
in
our
reply
brief
the
judge
real
said,
"at
the
end
of
the
trial
when
the
evidence
is
in,
it
is
possible
that
plaintiffs,
the
states
will
be
able
to
show
facts
to
this
court
sitting
equity
that
will
justify
the
kind
of
relief
they
seek."
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
well,
in
legislating
your
honor,
yes
i
do.
congress
has
said
that
in
respect
to
the
pre-1968
cars,
the
standards
of
the
emissions
are
up
to
the
states
but
i
do
not
think
that,
that
says
anything
about
what
would
happen
if
antitrust
violation
--
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
i
certainly
think
so,
your
honor.
congress
certainly
has
not
given
any
indication
to
abandon
the
field
in
any
of
this.
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
well
con
--
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
i
think
yes
mr.
justice
white
congress
made
a
political
a
compromise.
they
passed
the
law
and
they
said
we're
on
the
facts
that
we
have
before
us.
we're
going
to
set
emission
standards
based
on
things
done
to
new
cars.
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
well,
we
addressed
ourselves
yes
in
our
reply
brief
and
particularly
in
our
--
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
well,
on
that
point
we
address
--
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
no,
because
i
think
very
different
considerations
are
involved
except
possibly
for
this.
i
think
what
--
you
not
only
have
federal
law
versus
state
law
here
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
you
also
have
something
that
isn't
really
a
pre-emption
argument
at
all
which
is
the
role
of
a
legislative
body
in
regulating
the
air
and
the
role
of
a
court
of
equity
in
remedying
any
antitrust
violation.
now
it
just
so
happens
that
the
antitrust
conspirators,
the
antitrust
defendants
effectuated
their
conspiracy
in
an
area
which
affected
the
air.
but
i
--
and
so
i
don't
think
it's
a
choice
of
law
or
question
in
that
case
at
all.
i
think
when
the
equity
court
comes
to
render
the
decree
it's
going
to
have
to
consider
the
state
of
the
art.
it's
going
to
have
to
consider
by
that
time,
mr.
justice
white,
it's
entirely
possible
that
federal
law
will
govern
used
cars
because
congress
has
not
necessarily
indicated
an
intention
to
stands
still
on
this
and
the
epa,
the
federal
agency
has
a
real
role
in
directing
the
states
and
stimulating
the
states
in
respect
to
the
retrofit
inspection
programs
which
they
have
indicated
they
may
start
--
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
i
don't
believe
so.
i
believe
that
the
standard
applicable
on
original
action
is
set
in
article
3
of
the
constitution
and
derives
from
the
powers
of
this
court
and
the
only
--
the
only
thing
there
is
that
because
this
court
in
original
action
such
as
this
one
not
state
against
state
sir,
but
state
against
citizens
of
another
state
is
concurrent
with
federal
court
--
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
yes.
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
of
course
--
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
you
mean
to
take
away
jurisdiction
from
this
court?
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
i
see.
i
see
not
the
exercise
of
the
discretion
but
the
law
applicable.
they
have
specified
the
law
applicable
in
specifying
the
sherman
act
and
--
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
i
would
have
very
serious
question
with
a
congressional
imposition
on
the
powers
of
a
court
of
equity
to
grant
equitable
relief.
and
if
i
may
refer
to
guaranty
trust
versus
york,
which
is
not
in
our
brief,
it's
326
u.s.
99.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
that
opinion
wrote
a
rather
extended
dissertation
on
the
powers
of
equity
and
where
equity
powers
on
the
federal
court
came
from.
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
yes,
i
think
there
are
instances
where
the
court
stands
could
be
state
and
some
like
that
but
that
haven't
happen
here
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
in
fact,
that
to
the
contrary
all
that,
that
i
see
that
happen
is
that
congress
isn't
ready
yet
and
hasn't
been
ready
yet
to
apply
emission
standards
to
used
cars.
that's
really
all
it's
happen.
it
might
be
by
the
time
this
court
was
ready
to
decide
this
case
and
i
think
that
a
lot
of
the
reason
why
congress
hasn't
been
ready
yet
to
do
that
is
who
pays
for
it.
now,
mr.
cutler
mentioned
the
court
--
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
could
this
court
make
the
car
owner
do
it?
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
well,
i
think
this
and
--
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
you
could
not
make
him
accept
the
right
of
it.
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
yes
i
think
that
is
right
mr.
justice
marshall.
except
for
this,
i
think
that
the
relief,
the
equitable
relief
could
be
conditioned
on
a
state
enactment
of
retrofit
law
or
some
other
retrofit
administrative
requirement.
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
i
think.
pardon
me
sir?
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
i
think
you
could
get
condition
relief
on
it
i
don't
think
you
could
direct
the
state
to
pass
a
statute
but
i
think
that
court
of
equity
could
and
frequently
does
condition
relief
--m
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
no.
not
one
that's
not
involved.
now,
there
are
i'd
like
to
talk
about
two
things
because
i
think
you
couldn't
get
to
the
states
that
are
not
involved
because
they
wouldn't
be
any
antitrust
case
and
they
wouldn't
be
involve
in
the
antitrust
decree.
but
i
think
you
could
condition
or
the
court
of
equity
could
condition
the
granting
of
the
equitable
relief
on
meeting
certain
standards
and
one
of
the
standards
would
be
that
the
retrofit
be
put
on
the
car
so
that
the
cars
can
be
made
clean.
now,
i'd
like
to
mention
two
things
in
our
context.
one
is
mr.
cutler
referred
to
the
cost
of
equitable
relief
and
how
this
cost
would
somehow
interfere
with
the
efforts
of
the
automobile
companies
to
go
ahead
and
meet
the
75
standards.
i
think
that
argument
simply
has
no
place
here
at
all.
and
i
would
like
to
put
in
perspective.
the
cost
of
these
devices
according
to
these
defendants
is
approximately
$20.00
a
device.
we're
talking
now
today
about
50
million
used
cars.
each
year,
at
least
8
million
go
off
the
road
so
we
are
talking
at
most
about
less
than
a
billion
dollars
in
the
light
of
an
antitrust
conspiracy
that
lasted
15
years
and
in
the
light
of
net
after
tax
revenues
of
general
motors
alone
in
1971
of
over
$2
billion.
so
i
am
not
saying
it's
a
little
amount
of
money
that
is
involved.
but
it's
not
the
kind
of
gigantic
staggering
cost
that
mr.
cutler
has
indicated
at
the
court
would
be
involved.
and
secondly,
it
should
be
pointed
out
which
is
exactly
what
the
defendants
want
to
accomplish
that
as
we
go
on,
each
year
eight
million
leave
$116
million
is
depleted
from
the
obligation
that
these
defendants
could
meet
if
retrofit
is
the
correct
and
adequate
remedy.
and
i
would
like
to
say
that
mr.
cutler
did
say
that
when
i
quoted
him,
he
was
talking
in
1404
about
a
pre-mature
argument
that
the
--
that
it
would
be
premature
to
transfer
at
this
time.
but
he
went
further
at
that
at
page
53
of
the
transcript
and
he
said
and
i
assume
he
still
believes
it.
there
is
a
major
substantive
issue
as
to
whether
section
1404
meant
that
the
transferee
judge
in
effect
could
transfer
cases
to
himself
for
trial.
i
would
like
to
say
who
is
in
this
case.
mr.
cutler
has
said
there
are
18
states
and
california
isn't
in.
well,
california
did
sign
the
amicus
brief
and
which
it
said
if
the
court
agrees
to
entertain
his
complaint
amici
will
seek
leave
to
join
as
plaintiffs
here.
now,
they
haven't
changed
that
position.
california
is
under
just
a
little
bit
tighter
gun
than
some
of
the
rest
of
us
and
it's
because
their
state
is
getting
very
close
already.
they
passed
the
statute
in
november
1971
requiring
retrofit
when
devices
are
certified
and
made
mandatory
by
the
air
resources
board.
in
february
1972
report
which
mr.
cutler
submitted
late
yesterday
to
this
court,
there
is
an
indication
of
how
that
is
proceeding
devices
are
just
about
ready
to
certification
and
as
we
are
worried
about
a
trial
being
postponed
long
enough
so
that
the
equitable
relief
is
no
longer
viable
as
cars
go
off
the
road,
so
california
is
concerned
that
when
the
retrofit
law
goes
into
effect
and
when
cars
start
being
retrofitted
at
the
expense
of
california,
the
equitable
remedy
may
not
be
adequate
now
as
we
point
it
out
in
our
brief
--
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
no.
under
that
all
the
individual
citizen
of
california
pays
the
cost
and
that's
why
there
concern
that
they
would
need
and
even
quicker
resolution
of
this
but
it
would
be
sometime
in
1972
before
their
equitable
relief
becomes
a
less
viable
remedy
to
them.
unless
this
court,
as
we
indicate
in
our
brief
can
under
vane
versus
barnard
and
related
cases
direct
that
the
wrong
be
repaired
at
the
expense
of
the
defendant
and
make
restitution.
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
mr.
chief
justice,
my
name
is
fredric
tausend.
i
am
a
special
assistant
attorney
general
for
the
state
of
washington.
i
could
introduce
the
argument
now
if
that’s
satisfactory
to
mr.
cutler.
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
i
would
divide
my
argument
in
half
but
i’d
be
willing
to
do
it.
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
antitrust
action
brought
by
18
states
against
the
four
major
american
automobile
manufacturers
and
their
trade
association,
charging
the
defendants
with
violating
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
we
are
here
on
the
motion
of
the
plaintiff
states
to
file
this
action
as
an
original
action.
and
we
are
joined
in
this
request
by
18
additional
states
in
the
city
of
new
york
as
amici
curiae
who
have
indicated
to
this
court
that
they
would
intervene
in
this
action
for
a
total
of
36
states
in
the
city
of
new
york
if
this
court
exercises
its
original
jurisdiction.
now,
the
complaint
which
we
proposed
to
file
charges
the
defendants
with
a
section
1
sherman
act
conspiracy
lasting
over
15
years
from
1953
until
at
least
1968.
the
purpose
in
effect
of
which
was
to
delay,
prevent
and
retard
the
development,
the
manufacture
and
finally
the
installation
of
pollution
control
equipment
for
their
automobiles.
i
would
like
if
i
could,
to
flash
out
the
allegations
of
this
compliant
with
reference
to
some
of
the
documents
which
have
been
obtained
and
reviewed
by
us
in
connection
with
a
related
multi-district
proceeding
in
los
angeles
to
which
i
will
refer
shortly.
mainly
for
the
purpose
of
assuring
this
court
that
this
is
not
a
case
where
we
have
serious
allegations
of
illegal
activity
but
no
evidence
to
support
them.
but
a
protective
order
entered
in
mdl
31
prevents
me
from
giving
such
examples.
suffice
it
to
say,
that
the
charges
on
which
our
compliant
is
based
are
identical
to
a
civil
action
filed
by
the
justice
department
in
january
1969,
settled
in
october
1969
by
consent
decreed.
the
injunctive
relief
obtained
by
the
government
in
that
decree
is
entirely
preventative.
it
seeks
to
prevent
the
alleged
conspiracy
from
continuing
and
so
it
ended
the
alleged
conspiracy
and
to
quote
former
attorney
general
mitchell
as
we
do
as
page
18
of
our
opening
brief,
“it
encouraged
immediate
action
by
the
automobile
companies
to
solve
the
problem.
however,
it
did
not
attempt
to
repair
the
damage
which
continues
to
this
day
and
in
the
future
to
be
inflicted
by
the
cars
manufactured
as
a
result
of
the
alleged
conspiracy.”
and
this
is
where
the
36
states
and
the
other
governmental
bodies
have
taken
up
to
cajoles
with
this
action.
this
act
--
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
retrofit.
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
the
basic
relief
that
we’re
seeking,
we
ask
for
some
other
equitable
relief
but
the
basic
principle
thing
we’re
seeking
is
a
mandatory
or
reparative
injunction
which
would
require
the
installation
on
all
cars
manufactured
as
a
result
of
the
conspiracy
and
for
convenience
we
talked
about
pre
1968
cars.
that
might
be
the
first
cutoff
date
with
effective
pollution
control
equipment
and
that
is
called
“retrofit.”
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
the
aggregate
liability
of
the
users,
you
mean
the
people
who
drive
the
automobiles?
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
i
suppose
we
are
polluting
the
air,
your
honor.
i
don’t
think
the
users
have
violated
or
charged
with
violating
the
antitrust
laws
and
we’re
not
here
on
a
nuisance
count
and
as
the
court,
i
trust
to
where
in
our
latest
brief,
we
have
stricken
count
iii
and
we’ve
done
it
because
we
want
to
get
the
speediest
possible
remedy.
the
retrofit
remedy
is
only
a
viable
remedy
if
it
can
be
applied
quickly.
and
in
count
iii,
which
we
put
in
because
we
needed
it
as
a
backup
town,
we
didn’t
know
what
kind
of
an
antitrust
case
we
have.
we
haven’t
seen
any
documents
when
we
file
this.
now
appears
to
us
to
be
ballast
and
we’ve
thrown
it
over
board
to
speed
up
the
case
and
get
to
the
end
of
our
voyage
because,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
retrofit
remedy
and
i
can’t
give
you
an
actual
calendar
date
but
i
can
predict
reasonably
closely.
we
have
asked
in
the
multi-district
proceedings
and
i
will
probably
have
to
come
to
those
tomorrow
for
a
december
1972
target
trial
date
and
judge
real
on
those
proceedings
which
are
consolidated
on
1407
before
him
and
not
all
before
him
filed
in
this
court.
judge
real
has
indicated
that
as
a
practical
matter
he
is
geared
to
discovery
to
december
1972
target
trial
date
on
equitable
claims,
equitable
relief
only,
and
if
we
can
get
that
or
reasonably
near
that
then
retrofit
remedy
retains
its
viability.
but
as
the
defendants
have
pointed
out
in
there
briefs
at
every
occasion
and
as
we
point
out
in
our
source
of
law
brief
in
the
conclusion,
these
pre
1968
cars
of
which
they
are
now
50
million
approximately
in
the
united
states
are
leaving
the
road
at
the
rate
of
seven
or
eight
million
cars
a
year
and
that
rate
maybe
accelerated.
now,
they’re
leaving
the
pollution
in
the
air
but
they’re
leaving
the
road
and
then
say,
two
years
or
three
years,
there
will
be
fewer
and
fewer
of
these
cars,
the
air
will
have
been
polluted
and
the
res
to
which
the
equitable
remedy
could
attach
the
possibility
if
this
defendants
has
alleged
did
violate
the
antitrust
laws,
the
possibility
of
making
them
supply
the
equitable
remedy
of
which
best
gets
the
wrong
alleged
is
reduced
and
even
eliminated
and
that
is
why
--
because
in
this
case
we
see
--
its
one
of
those
rare
cases
where
the
best
remedy
is
the
simplest
remedy.
it’s
direct,
it
cleans
the
air,
it
doesn’t
compensate
in
money.
the
defendants
themselves
as
we
point
as
--
as
we
point
out
at
page
21
of
our
choice
of
law
brief
have
indicated,
number
one,
that
effective
devices
do
exist.
both
chrysler
and
delco
have
such
devices
and
i’ve
talked
about
them
and
as
we
also
point
out
at
page
21
of
that
choice
of
law
brief,
mr.
delorean,
a
vice
president
of
general
motors
riding
in
look
magazine
in
may
of
1970
said,
that
--
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
our
choice
of
law
brief,
your
honor
is
gray,
the
finest
memorandum
and
the
quote
i
have
is
on
page
21,
right
at
the
bottom,
john
delorean,
vice
president
of
general
motors,
in
charge
of
chevrolet
division,
what
magazine?
page
57,
august
25,
1970,
said,
“if
every
car
produced
before
1969
had
available
retrofit
devices,
our
air
would
be
as
pure
as
it
was
30
years
ago.”
now,
allowing
for
some
exaggeration,
maybe
30%
if
it
could
be
as
pure
as
it
was
20
years
ago
and
if
they
did
violate
the
antitrust
laws
as
alleged
and
if
we
can
prove
that
then
it
seems
to
me
the
remedy
most
clearly
directed
to
the
wrong
is
available
if
it
can
be
obtained
quickly
enough.
i
think
before
i
talk
about
further
the
remedy
and
the
reason
why
we
need
original
jurisdiction,
i
would
meet
briefly
the
court’s
request
to
talk
about
the
applicable
sustentative
law
and
that
is
really
easy
because
the
question
is
largely
moot.
as
i
pointed
out,
count
iii
has
been
stricken
and
i
gave
you
the
reasons.
count
ii
is
a
common
law
antitrust
account.
and
number
one,
that
was
included,
i
think
as
a
very
remote
hedge
against
the
possibility,
the
court
of
equity
would
as
the
defendants
argue
it
should
adopt
an
interpretation
of
the
section
16
of
the
clayton
act,
that
section
16
clayton
act,
equity
court
doesn’t
have
the
full
powers
that
a
common
law
equity
or
federal
equity
court
has.
in
any
event,
we’re
in
total
agreement
with
mr.
cutler
on
this.
his
brief
states
that
is
an
independent
count
based
on
state
common
law
and
we
agree.
we
don’t
think
the
counts
are
going
to
be
reduced
and
i
really
think
that
that
for
this
case
resolves
the
question
of
choice
of
law.
now,
i
would
like
to
come
to
the
reasons
why
we’re
urging
this
court
to
accept
original
jurisdiction
of
this
case.
we
recognized,
although
defendants
suggests
we
don’t,
the
burden
that
an
original
action
case
puts
on
the
court,
we
believe
that
this
case
fully
satisfies
the
standards
laid
down
by
this
court
in
wyandotte
and
in
georgia
versus
the
pennsylvania
railroad
company.
there
simply
is
no
state
forum
to
which
this
cost
could
be
remitted
as
was
the
case
with
the
state
court
of
ohio
in
wyandotte.
this
is
a
federal
antitrust
case
and
we
also
believe
there
is
no
single
federal
court
and
i
want
to
emphasize
single
federal
court
because
we
believe
in
the
interest
of
the
burden
on
the
judiciary
system,
in
the
interest
of
at
least
the
plaintiff
states
because
the
defendants
want
a
different
result
that
this
case
should
be
tried
in
a
single
court,
the
equitable
claims
of
the
public
body
plaintiffs
we
believe
can
and
should
be
tried
in
a
single
federal
court.
now,
the
obvious
question
occurs,
why
not
the
central
district
of
los
angeles
where
judge
real
is
presiding
as
a
district
judge.
and
i
think
that
the
answer
is
that
the
defendants
won’t
let
us
and
if
they’re
in
the
position
to
keep
us
from
that
single
trial
there
long
enough
to
make
the
equitable
remedy
no
longer
viable.
so,
we
have
a
consideration
of
time,
a
speedy
remedy
in
order
to
make
the
equitable
relief
viable
and
a
consideration
of
place,
a
single
court.
you
see,
in
the
multi-district
proceedings
in
los
angeles,
only
nine
states
actually
filed
in
los
angeles,
two
actions.
the
state
of
california,
the
state
of
washington
and
seven
states
has
filed
on
a
consolidated
action
with
us.
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday
afternoon
i
told
you
what
this
case
was
about.
this
morning,
i
hope
to
persuade
you
to
exercise
your
discretion
to
accept
this
case
as
an
original
action.
the
states
who
are
plaintiffs
in
the
amici
seek
two
things.
one,
a
single
unified
trial
of
the
antitrust
for
equitable
relief
only,
and
two,
a
speedy
resolution
of
this
litigation
so
that
what
now
appears
to
be
the
most
adequate
equitable
remedy
namely
retrofit
of
pre
1968
cars
at
the
expense
of
the
defendants
can
remain
a
viable
possibility
for
the
court
to
administer
if
it
sees
fit
to
do
so
at
the
conclusion
of
the
case.
under
the
standards
which
this
court
lay
down
in
wyandotte
and
georgia,
you
must
been
exercising
your
discretion
ascertain
first
if
there
was
an
alternative
forum
to
which
this
case
may
be
remitted
in
the
interest
of
convenience,
efficiency,
and
justice.
now
clearly
because
this
is
a
sherman
act,
section
1
case,
that
forum
must
be
a
federal
one.
the
appellant's
alternative
forum
that
comes
to
mind
is
the
district
court
in
the
central
district
of
california
at
los
angeles,
the
multidistrict
court.
judge
real
has
served
almost
two
years
as
the
1407
transferee
judge.
he
is
familiar
with
many
of
the
facts
in
this
litigation
in
that
capacity.
he
has
presided
over
extensive
pre-trial
hearings
i
believe
there
have
been
at
least
six.
he
has
attended
portions
of
a
two
depositions
of
officers
to
the
defendants
that
have
been
taking
to
date.
he
has
read
some
of
the
documents
which
were
submitted
to
him
in
a
brief
under
seal
and
he
has
made
it
clear
by
adopting
the
plaintiff
proposed
discovery
and
trial
preparation
schedule
that
under
his
direction
these
cases
could
be
ready
to
go
to
trial
in
december
1972.
but
standing
ultimately
in
the
way
of
that
resolution,
a
single
trial
in
december
1972
on
the
equitable
issues
are
these
defendants.
as
i
pointed
that
yesterday,
34
of
the
governmental
cases
were
brought
in
districts
other
than
central
district
of
california,
23
separate
districts
as
a
matter
of
fact.
so
to
achieve
a
single
trial
at
the
district
court
level
there
would
have
to
be
transfers
to
los
angeles
of
all
34
cases
under
28
usc
section
1404.
and
the
defendants
have
announced
time
and
again
that
they
would
resist
such
to
transfers
and
such
a
consolidated
trial.
at
page
4
of
their
supplemental
brief
which
is
the
cream-colored
brief,
the
next
to
the
last
brief
they
filed
in
this
action.
they
assert
that
the
joint
trial
was
not
feasible,
not
feasible.
and
at
the
proceeding
before
judge
real
in
los
angeles,
a
week
ago
thursday,
the
defendants
indicated
just
how
vigorously
they
will
resist
such
a
transfer
on
both
substantive
and
procedural
grounds
if
judge
real
attempts
to
go
ahead
with
it.
i
have
submitted
the
transcripts
of
those
proceedings
such
an
the
appendix
to
our
brief
and
i
am
going
to
quote
for
mr.
cutler,
at
page
51
of
the
transcript.
i
am
going
a
quote
a
few
remarks
and
if
the
court
has
the
transcript
and
would
like
to
see
the
entire
context
of
those
remarks
that
mr.
cutler
made,
i'll
invite
your
attention
to
page
51.
mr.
cutler
told
the
court
and
i
quote,
"i
think
we
would
have
to
say
that
any
decision
at
this
point
in
favor
of
transfer
and
consolidation
is
something
which
we
would
feel
bound
to
seek
review."
and
then
said
mr.
cutler
everything
would
be
help
up
while
that
was
being
resolved.
now,
mr.
cutler's
thrust
has
two
points.
one,
very
clearly
the
defendants
intend
if
they
can
to
hold
up
everything
attacking
this
transfers
and
the
second
point
is
that
they
will
seek
with
you
which
means
that
ultimately
this
case
is
going
to
reach
this
court
and
probably
more
than
once
because
the
defendants
have
already
taken
and
interlocutory
appeal
from
judge
real's
order
denying
their
motion
to
dismiss.
the
interlocutory
appeal
your
honors
was
certified
in
november
1970.
the
case
was
finally
argued
in
the
ninth
circuit
on
january
1972,
it
is
now
subjudicy
and
certiorari
i
believe
as
certain.
so
i
think
the
defendants
have
made
it
clear
that
they're
not
going
to
let
this
court
escape
the
burden
of
this
litigation.
so
the
question
then
is
i
believe,
would
the
burden
imposed
by
accepting
original
jurisdiction
as
we
urge
this
court
to
do,
especially
where
the
master
can
be
a
federal
district
judge
who
is
totally
familiar
with
the
case
and
was
indicated
that
but
for
the
legal
obstacles
which
the
defendants
are
raising,
he
would
most
probably
be
prepared
to
go
to
trial
on
the
equitable
claims
on
december
1972.
is
that
burden
really
greater
than
the
burden
imposed
by
the
persistent,
excuse
me,
by
the
persistent
threat
from
the
defendants
on
what
can
only
be
characterized
as
protracted
in
piecemeal
litigation.
and
beyond
the
burden
that
would
be
imposed
on
this
court
is
the
burden
which
would
be
imposed
on
the
entire
federal
judicial
system
if
the
defendants
succeed
on
delaying
the
trial
to
a
point
where
the
possibility
of
equitable
relief
through
retrofit
is
no
longer
a
viable
one
because
of
the
delays
in
time
and
the
cars
leaving
the
road
at
the
rate
of
8
to
10
million
a
year
as
it
accelerates
as
i
explained
to
the
court
yesterday.
because
of
that
point,
at
some
point
on
the
future
money
damages
would
then
be
the
only
sensible
recourse
of
the
states
and
the
difficulties
and
complexities
of
this
case
will
be
every
bit
as
great
and
perhaps
greater
than
the
multidistrict
panel
warned
up
when
it
assigned
these
cases
to
judge
real.
now
the
defendants
also
will
be
greatly
burden
by
multiple
jury
trials
and
diverse
appeals
but
apparently
they
are
willing
to
bear
this
burden
in
order
to
avoid
paying
in
this
way
for
their
sherman
act
violations.
it
is
to
avoid
these
burdens
on
the
court
on
the
federal
judiciary
on
the
34
states
and
new
york
and
to
obtain
an
early
end
to
the
litigation
and
to
preserve
the
possibility
of
retrofit
relief
at
the
defendants
expense
as
a
viable
remedy
for
the
wrong
alleged
that
we
urged
this
court
now
to
accept
the
original
jurisdiction
of
this
case,
appoint
judge
real
as
your
master
and
let
us
proceed
the
trial
in
december
1972,
that
is
my
argument.
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
yes,
i
do
your
honor.
your
honors,
this
is
not
an
air
pollution
case.
this
is
not
retrofit
case.
this
is
not
a
nuisance
case.
it
is
an
antitrust
case
for
equitable
relief
only
and
it
is
true
that
we
have
emphasized
in
urging
you
to
accept
the
original
jurisdiction
the
widely
possibility
of
seeking
as
we
do
now
and
seeking
at
the
end
of
the
trial
retrofit
relief
for
pre-1968
cars
as
the
most
adequate
remedy
if
we
proved
the
antitrust
wrong.
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
well
--
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
yes,
we
are
not
seeking
preventive
relief
mr.
justice
white.
we
are
not
trying
to
collaterally
supplement
--
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
the
other
possibility
as
we
hold
out
are
possibility
of
additional
devices
on
new
cars
if
the
technology
of
speed
or
an
accelerated
research
program
which
we're
not
particularly
emphasizing
at
this
times
and
might
raise
additional
problems
but
we
do
want
to
keep
the
equitable
relief
flexible
although
we
think
and
we're
pretty
sure
that
the
partly
because
of
what
the
defendants
have
said
and
what
technology
seems
to
be
producing
that
the
retrofit
device
making
those
cars
manufactured
doing
the
period
of
the
conspiracy
clean
cars
which
they
would
have
been,
but
for
the
antitrust
conspiracy
is
the
most
fitted
device.
but
i
want
to
make
clear
that
we're
not
asking
this
court
today
to
decide
that
issue.
we're
asking
this
court
because
we
think
it
would
be
pre-mature.
it
came
before
judge
real
and
he
said
it's
pre-mature.
and
we
quoted
in
our
reply
brief
the
judge
real
said,
"at
the
end
of
the
trial
when
the
evidence
is
in,
it
is
possible
that
plaintiffs,
the
states
will
be
able
to
show
facts
to
this
court
sitting
equity
that
will
justify
the
kind
of
relief
they
seek."
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
well,
in
legislating
your
honor,
yes
i
do.
congress
has
said
that
in
respect
to
the
pre-1968
cars,
the
standards
of
the
emissions
are
up
to
the
states
but
i
do
not
think
that,
that
says
anything
about
what
would
happen
if
antitrust
violation
--
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
i
certainly
think
so,
your
honor.
congress
certainly
has
not
given
any
indication
to
abandon
the
field
in
any
of
this.
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
well
con
--
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
i
think
yes
mr.
justice
white
congress
made
a
political
a
compromise.
they
passed
the
law
and
they
said
we're
on
the
facts
that
we
have
before
us.
we're
going
to
set
emission
standards
based
on
things
done
to
new
cars.
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
well,
we
addressed
ourselves
yes
in
our
reply
brief
and
particularly
in
our
--
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
well,
on
that
point
we
address
--
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
no,
because
i
think
very
different
considerations
are
involved
except
possibly
for
this.
i
think
what
--
you
not
only
have
federal
law
versus
state
law
here
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
you
also
have
something
that
isn't
really
a
pre-emption
argument
at
all
which
is
the
role
of
a
legislative
body
in
regulating
the
air
and
the
role
of
a
court
of
equity
in
remedying
any
antitrust
violation.
now
it
just
so
happens
that
the
antitrust
conspirators,
the
antitrust
defendants
effectuated
their
conspiracy
in
an
area
which
affected
the
air.
but
i
--
and
so
i
don't
think
it's
a
choice
of
law
or
question
in
that
case
at
all.
i
think
when
the
equity
court
comes
to
render
the
decree
it's
going
to
have
to
consider
the
state
of
the
art.
it's
going
to
have
to
consider
by
that
time,
mr.
justice
white,
it's
entirely
possible
that
federal
law
will
govern
used
cars
because
congress
has
not
necessarily
indicated
an
intention
to
stands
still
on
this
and
the
epa,
the
federal
agency
has
a
real
role
in
directing
the
states
and
stimulating
the
states
in
respect
to
the
retrofit
inspection
programs
which
they
have
indicated
they
may
start
--
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
i
don't
believe
so.
i
believe
that
the
standard
applicable
on
original
action
is
set
in
article
3
of
the
constitution
and
derives
from
the
powers
of
this
court
and
the
only
--
the
only
thing
there
is
that
because
this
court
in
original
action
such
as
this
one
not
state
against
state
sir,
but
state
against
citizens
of
another
state
is
concurrent
with
federal
court
--
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
yes.
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
of
course
--
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
you
mean
to
take
away
jurisdiction
from
this
court?
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
i
see.
i
see
not
the
exercise
of
the
discretion
but
the
law
applicable.
they
have
specified
the
law
applicable
in
specifying
the
sherman
act
and
--
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
i
would
have
very
serious
question
with
a
congressional
imposition
on
the
powers
of
a
court
of
equity
to
grant
equitable
relief.
and
if
i
may
refer
to
guaranty
trust
versus
york,
which
is
not
in
our
brief,
it's
326
u.s.
99.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
that
opinion
wrote
a
rather
extended
dissertation
on
the
powers
of
equity
and
where
equity
powers
on
the
federal
court
came
from.
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
yes,
i
think
there
are
instances
where
the
court
stands
could
be
state
and
some
like
that
but
that
haven't
happen
here
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
in
fact,
that
to
the
contrary
all
that,
that
i
see
that
happen
is
that
congress
isn't
ready
yet
and
hasn't
been
ready
yet
to
apply
emission
standards
to
used
cars.
that's
really
all
it's
happen.
it
might
be
by
the
time
this
court
was
ready
to
decide
this
case
and
i
think
that
a
lot
of
the
reason
why
congress
hasn't
been
ready
yet
to
do
that
is
who
pays
for
it.
now,
mr.
cutler
mentioned
the
court
--
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
could
this
court
make
the
car
owner
do
it?
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
well,
i
think
this
and
--
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
you
could
not
make
him
accept
the
right
of
it.
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
yes
i
think
that
is
right
mr.
justice
marshall.
except
for
this,
i
think
that
the
relief,
the
equitable
relief
could
be
conditioned
on
a
state
enactment
of
retrofit
law
or
some
other
retrofit
administrative
requirement.
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
i
think.
pardon
me
sir?
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
i
think
you
could
get
condition
relief
on
it
i
don't
think
you
could
direct
the
state
to
pass
a
statute
but
i
think
that
court
of
equity
could
and
frequently
does
condition
relief
--m
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
no.
not
one
that's
not
involved.
now,
there
are
i'd
like
to
talk
about
two
things
because
i
think
you
couldn't
get
to
the
states
that
are
not
involved
because
they
wouldn't
be
any
antitrust
case
and
they
wouldn't
be
involve
in
the
antitrust
decree.
but
i
think
you
could
condition
or
the
court
of
equity
could
condition
the
granting
of
the
equitable
relief
on
meeting
certain
standards
and
one
of
the
standards
would
be
that
the
retrofit
be
put
on
the
car
so
that
the
cars
can
be
made
clean.
now,
i'd
like
to
mention
two
things
in
our
context.
one
is
mr.
cutler
referred
to
the
cost
of
equitable
relief
and
how
this
cost
would
somehow
interfere
with
the
efforts
of
the
automobile
companies
to
go
ahead
and
meet
the
75
standards.
i
think
that
argument
simply
has
no
place
here
at
all.
and
i
would
like
to
put
in
perspective.
the
cost
of
these
devices
according
to
these
defendants
is
approximately
$20.00
a
device.
we're
talking
now
today
about
50
million
used
cars.
each
year,
at
least
8
million
go
off
the
road
so
we
are
talking
at
most
about
less
than
a
billion
dollars
in
the
light
of
an
antitrust
conspiracy
that
lasted
15
years
and
in
the
light
of
net
after
tax
revenues
of
general
motors
alone
in
1971
of
over
$2
billion.
so
i
am
not
saying
it's
a
little
amount
of
money
that
is
involved.
but
it's
not
the
kind
of
gigantic
staggering
cost
that
mr.
cutler
has
indicated
at
the
court
would
be
involved.
and
secondly,
it
should
be
pointed
out
which
is
exactly
what
the
defendants
want
to
accomplish
that
as
we
go
on,
each
year
eight
million
leave
$116
million
is
depleted
from
the
obligation
that
these
defendants
could
meet
if
retrofit
is
the
correct
and
adequate
remedy.
and
i
would
like
to
say
that
mr.
cutler
did
say
that
when
i
quoted
him,
he
was
talking
in
1404
about
a
pre-mature
argument
that
the
--
that
it
would
be
premature
to
transfer
at
this
time.
but
he
went
further
at
that
at
page
53
of
the
transcript
and
he
said
and
i
assume
he
still
believes
it.
there
is
a
major
substantive
issue
as
to
whether
section
1404
meant
that
the
transferee
judge
in
effect
could
transfer
cases
to
himself
for
trial.
i
would
like
to
say
who
is
in
this
case.
mr.
cutler
has
said
there
are
18
states
and
california
isn't
in.
well,
california
did
sign
the
amicus
brief
and
which
it
said
if
the
court
agrees
to
entertain
his
complaint
amici
will
seek
leave
to
join
as
plaintiffs
here.
now,
they
haven't
changed
that
position.
california
is
under
just
a
little
bit
tighter
gun
than
some
of
the
rest
of
us
and
it's
because
their
state
is
getting
very
close
already.
they
passed
the
statute
in
november
1971
requiring
retrofit
when
devices
are
certified
and
made
mandatory
by
the
air
resources
board.
in
february
1972
report
which
mr.
cutler
submitted
late
yesterday
to
this
court,
there
is
an
indication
of
how
that
is
proceeding
devices
are
just
about
ready
to
certification
and
as
we
are
worried
about
a
trial
being
postponed
long
enough
so
that
the
equitable
relief
is
no
longer
viable
as
cars
go
off
the
road,
so
california
is
concerned
that
when
the
retrofit
law
goes
into
effect
and
when
cars
start
being
retrofitted
at
the
expense
of
california,
the
equitable
remedy
may
not
be
adequate
now
as
we
point
it
out
in
our
brief
--
mr.
fredric
c.
tausend
no.
under
that
all
the
individual
citizen
of
california
pays
the
cost
and
that's
why
there
concern
that
they
would
need
and
even
quicker
resolution
of
this
but
it
would
be
sometime
in
1972
before
their
equitable
relief
becomes
a
less
viable
remedy
to
them.
unless
this
court,
as
we
indicate
in
our
brief
can
under
vane
versus
barnard
and
related
cases
direct
that
the
wrong
be
repaired
at
the
expense
of
the
defendant
and
make
restitution.
