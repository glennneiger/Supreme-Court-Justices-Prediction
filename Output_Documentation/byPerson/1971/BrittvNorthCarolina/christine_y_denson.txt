ms.
christine
y.
denson
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
want
very
strenuously
to
divorce
this
case
from
the
one
this
court
has
just
heard
because
we
are
in
a
court
far
the
situation
with
this
case.
the
north
carolina
system
i
am
very
proud
off.
we
do
have
trial
de
novo
even
for
the
petty
offenses
or
misdemeanor
and
in
event
those
cases
are
appealed
nor
collaterally
attacked
by
certiorari
or
by
habeas
corpus,
file
temporary
out,
a
transcript
would
be
available
and
the
merits
of
statement
that
our
appellate
courts
require
would
be
coming,
forth
coming
from
that
transcript
which
would
be
made
available.
so
we
are
certainly
not
talking
about
cases
that
i
said,
this
court
has
--
as
i
read
your
decision
previously
decided.
here
we
are
talking
about
a
direct
attack,
we
talking
about
direct
appeal,
we
are
talking
about
a
collateral
attack
on
habeas
corpus
with
the
question
of
transcript
being
made
available.
rather
we
are
talking
about
the
mistrial
situation
which
can
be
extended.
we
are
talking
about
mistrial
situation
which
as
the
court
has
already
pointed
out
can
be
extended
not
only
in
the
mistrial
application
but
in
preliminary
hearing.
as
your
honors
pointed
out,
a
rich
could
hire
a
reporter
to
come
in
and
take
the
transcript
and
could
make
that
available
to
himself
on
his
trial,
he
could
thereby
impeach
the
witnesses.
we
are
talking
also
about
the
trial
de
novo
situation
which
we
have
in
north
carolina
and
in
many
other
states.
a
rich
man
again
could
hire
reporter
to
come
on
his
traffic
offense
and
hear
the
testimony
there
and
have
that
reporter
available
at
his
appeal
in
superior
court
to
again
to
try
to
impeach
the
testimony.
so
we
are
talking
about
an
application
that
is
far
divorced
from
the
previous
decisions
of
this
court
and
we
are
talking
about
an
application
that
could
be
very
sweepy
and
it
go
not
only
to
this
mistrial
situation
of
which
hopefully
there
are
limited
number,
but
could
go
to
the
preliminary
hearing
or
to
any
other
trial
or
any
other
kind
of
testimony
by
witness
who
comes
on
at
the
trial
with
final
result
from
a
conviction
and
we
would
emphasize
that
fact
to
the
court.
we
have
also
in
this
case
no
indication
that
counsel
did
try
to
contact
the
court
reporter.
we
note
that
the
appendix
shows
that
the
motion
for
the
transcript
whether
actually
presented
to
the
court
at
that
time
or
not
was
dated
the
25
november
and
the
man
was
not
tried
until
mid
december
and
so
counsel
knew
what
he
was
going
to
do
on
the
25
november
at
least
in
making
his
motion
for
a
transcript
and
there
is
no
evidence
that
he
made
any
efforts
to
get
up
with
the
court
reporter.
he
says,
the
reporter
would
have
told
him
what
was
in
that
transcript.
he
could
have
made
notes
himself
and
then
again
the
reporter
was
available
and
is
on
trial.
he
found
from
his
notes
that
there
were
some
discrepancies.
he
could
have
asked
those
questions
of
the
court
reporter
and
brought
the
court
reporter
on
to
impeach
the
witness.
as
it
was,
he
had
of
course
available
to
him
the
fact
that
this
captain
brucher
had
made
no
notes.
he
pointed
that
out
to
the
jury.
he
pointed
out
to
the
jury
that
the
alleged
confession
was
never
reduced
to
writing,
again
calling
into
question
the
credibility
of
that
witness.
in
fact
we
think
that
he
had
available
to
him
all
of
the
things
which
the
jury
could
see
that
would
impeach
the
credibility
of
this
witness.
we
think
rather,
we
got
a
case
where
although
there
are
some
alleged
discrepancies
in
the
testimony
and
we
do
not
know
what
those
discrepancies
actually
were,
they
are
not
important
to
this
case.
we
are
talking
about
the
difference
between
questioning
a
witness
30
or
45
minutes
and
an
hour
and
a
half.
we
do
not
think
that
is
important.
we
are
talking
about
whether
or
not
he
made
some
comments
at
the
first
trial
about
the
defendant’s
clothes.
again,
that
cannot
be
important.
question
of
who
took
the
fingerprints
from
the
water
glass?
was
it
the
officer
dody
who
was
present
at
the
present
the
second
time
the
defendant
confessed
and
testified
about
that
or
was
it
accompanied
by
through
himself.
that
cannot
be
important.
ms.
christine
y.
denson
your
honor
i
would
say
no,
i
would
not
say
he
was.
ms.
christine
y.
denson
he
testified
as
to
defendant’s
confession
the
first
time
then
after
that
he
got
on
who
was
present
the
second
time
the
defendant
repeated
his
statement
in
front
of
brucher,
afobest,
the
girlfriend
and
officer
dody.
so
we
have
a
reconfirmation
of
those
times.
his
statement
was
essentially
the
same.
we
have
done
to
the
facts
that
(inaudible)
got
to
blow
with
a
knife
and
he
did
not
do
that
himself.
so
we
have
some
collaboration
there
of
brucher's
testimony
by
officer
dody.
ms.
christine
y.
denson
yes,
afobest
herself,
the
girlfriend
who
was
present,
testified
and
the
discrepancy
between
what
he
had
to
say
and
what
part
of
the
confession
of
the
defendant
would
be
or
was
a
difference
in
who
struck
the
blow
with
a
knife.
she
said
the
defendant
did
it
and
that
she
only
stayed
there
because
she
was
scared
of
him.
the
defendant
said
that
she
got
the
blow
with
the
knife.
ms.
christine
y.
denson
it
was
the
frying
pan
that
killed
the
deceased.
the
medical
testimony
of
the
doctor
was
that
the
knife
wound
was
superficial
and
it
would
not
have
inflected
death.
ms.
christine
y.
denson
i
do
not
recall
from
the
record.
i
believe
--
ms.
christine
y.
denson
i
believe
it
is
t.m.
i
talked
to
captain
brucher
yesterday
about
the
matter.
in
short,
we
think
that
the
alleged
discrepancies
here
and
counsel
will
admit
that
he
cannot
take
for
sure
what
those
discrepancies
are,
are
not
important
discrepancies
in
this
case
and
for
the
court
to
use
this
case
as
a
step
to
take
a
very
giant
step
who
can
make
transcripts
available
to
defendants,
we
think
would
be
serious
miscarriage
of
justice.
as
the
court
has
pointed
out,
we
think
that
this
would
put
a
premium
a
mistrial,
not
only
of
course
do
the
disagreeing
jurors
cause
mistrials,
but
the
conduct
of
a
defendant
or
of
some
witness
or
even
if
some
police
officer,
as
we
had
in
our
state
where
the
policeman
will
put
defendants
in
handcuffs
in
view
of
the
jury
or
some
such
things
can
cause
a
mistrial.
if
the
defendant
has
some
key
testimony
and
his
attorney
has
not
known
about
it
before
and
he
does
not
like
what
his
attorney
does
and
(inaudible)
by
a
way
of
cross
examination
of
that
witness,
we
think
it
would
put
a
premium
on
the
mistrial
situation
for
him
to
cause
a
mistrial
knowing
that
he
could
get
a
free
transcript
from
the
state
and
have
that
available
for
his
attorney
on
the
next
trial
to
better
cross
examine
the
witnesses.
so
we
fear
that
result.
we
fear
also
of
course
the
overburdening
of
our
trial
courts.
we
make
transcripts
available
when
the
defendant
is
directly
appealing
on
collateral,
they
are
attacking
his
conviction.
we
feel
that
they
are
entitled
to
that.
in
north
carolina
we
have
done
that
voluntarily
on
the
smallest
offense,
but
to
recall
the
court
authority
to
delay
the
activities,
the
court
to
delay
the
preparation
of
transcripts
for
direct
appeals,
in
order
to
prepare
the
transcripts
of
the
mistrials
was
again
caused
the
delay
in
the
court
system
which
seriously
overburdened
the
reporting
of
our
own
state
courts
and
those
of
other
state
and
the
federal
courts
with
them.
for
that
reason
we
ask
the
court
not
to
take
that
step.
ms.
christine
y.
denson
yes.
i
do
not
have
the
statistics
--
ms.
christine
y.
denson
your
honor,
i
have
no
idea.
i
do
not
even
have
a
statistics
for
our
state.
ms.
christine
y.
denson
no
we
do
not,
but
we
think
that
this
--
ms.
christine
y.
denson
well,
your
honor,
far
from
those
that
we
have
now,
we
are
afraid
that
this
would
give
them
an
additional
reason
to
make
a
mistrial.
not
only
the
defendant
who
would
tend
to
be
disruptive
anyway,
but
the
defendant
who
knowing
that
he
has
got
a
transcript
available,
he
causes
a
mistrial
and
feels
for
some
reason
that
he
is
not
happy
with
counsel
and
could
do
better
the
next
time,
maybe
even
changing
counsel,
this
would
give
him
an
additional
reason
we
do
not
want.
ms.
christine
y.
denson
well,
i
do
not
think
anyone
knows
your
honor,
certainly
i
do
not.
i
do
not
know
the
incidents
now,
but
i
am
afraid
the
incidents
will
be
increased
and
this
is
our
great
theory.
we
think
that
the
defendant
on
a
showing
of
needs
might
be
entitled
to
a
transcript.
there
maybe
some
reason
that
the
court
reporter
is
not
available.
there
maybe
some
reason
of
a
key
state
witness
which
we
do
not
have
in
this
case
and
maybe
occasion
for
key
testimonies
that
he
does
want
to
check,
but
first
of
all
we
do
not
have
any
indication
in
this
case
that
he
could
not
have
secured
and
that
they
tried
and
secondly
we
do
not
have
identification
of
special
need
in
this
case.
ms.
christine
y.
denson
no.
i
think
the
essential
reason
our
court
said,
made
no
decision
with
the
first
reason
i
alluded
it
to
that
there
been
no
showing
that
he
had
not
had
the
court
reporter
available
to
call
and
that
there
is
no
showing
that
he
made
any
effort
to
make
use
of
that
formal
transcript
in
between
the
trial
and
for
that
reason
though
it
is
no
showing
of
needs.
ms.
christine
y.
denson
i
believe
judge
mao
did
discuss
since
i
urged
to
him
as
i
urge
to
this
court
today
that
the
point
at
which
they
were
alleged
discrepancies
which
fill
and
they
attended
on
minor.
ms.
christine
y.
denson
yes.
i
believe
there
was,
the
usual
motions
that
are
made
for
a
new
trial.
ms.
christine
y.
denson
i
think
that
you
(inaudible)
as
available.
ms.
christine
y.
denson
well,
yes
your
honor.
practically
i
think
the
time
for
doing
that
would
be
before
the
defendant
rested
this
case.
the
court
of
course
gives
him
time
to
get
ready
to
make
his
presentation
and
at
that
point
i
think
he
could
have
searched
his
memory
for
any
discrepancy
he
thought
there
was.
the
court
reporter
was
there
at
that
time
and
could
have
asked
for
a
recess
and
taken
two
years
the
time
for
this
court,
certainly
is
far
in
a
way
grater
delay
than
the
one
they
might
have
been
occasioned
by
getting
the
court
reporter
to
search
his
notes
and
although
i
cannot
say
this
to
the
court
with
certainty,
i
am
very
certain
the
court
would
have
allow
him
that
delay,
if
he
told
the
court
that
he
thought
there
were
discrepancies
and
he
wanted
to
see
what
the
reporter
might
show.
we
think
there
is
been
an
absence
by
the
defendants
of
any
showing
for
special
need
in
this
case
and
at
the
very
least
if
the
court
is
going
to
say
transcript
should
be
available,
we
think
that
that
ought
to
be
restricted
to
those
cases
where
there
is
some
sort
of
showing
the
need.
for
that
reason,
we
would
ask
the
court
not
to
extend
the
doctrine
on
transcript
and
to
say
that
in
the
case
of
mistrials,
they
remain
in
all
of
this,
they
are
not
important
for
that
objectively,
they
are
not
important
for
these
reasons
unless
there
is
some
special
need
in
the
case.
thank
you.
ms.
christine
y.
denson
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
want
very
strenuously
to

from

we
are

so
we
are
certainly
not

this
court
has
--
as
i
read
your
decision
previously
decided.
here
we
are
talking

we
talking
about
direct

we
are

which
as
the
court
has
already
pointed

can
be

we

so
we
are
talking
about
an

and
we
are

at

for
a

and
there
is
no

the
testimony
and
we
do
not
know
what
those
discrepancies
actually
were,
they
are
not
important
to
this
case.
we
are
talking
about
the
difference
between
questioning
a
witness
30
or
45
minutes
and
an
hour
and
a
half.
we
do
not
think
that
is
important.
we
are
talking
about
whether
or
not
he
made
some
comments
at
the
first
trial
about
the
defendant’s
clothes.
again,
that
cannot
be
important.
question
of
who
took
the
fingerprints
from
the
water
glass?
was
it
the
officer
dody
who
was
present
at
the
present
the
second
time
the
defendant
confessed
and
testified
about
that
or
was
it
accompanied
by
through
himself.
that
cannot
be
important.
ms.
christine
y.
denson
your
honor
i
would
say
no,
i
would
not
say
he
was.
ms.
christine
y.
denson
he
testified
as
to
defendant’s
confession
the
first
time
then
after
that
he
got
on
who
was
present
the
second
time
the
defendant
repeated
his
statement
in
front
of
brucher,
afobest,
the
girlfriend
and
officer
dody.
so
we
have
a
reconfirmation
of
those
times.
his
statement
was
essentially
the
same.
we
have
done
to
the
facts
that
(inaudible)
got
to
blow
with
a
knife
and
he
did
not
do
that
himself.
so
we
have
some
collaboration
there
of
brucher's
testimony
by
officer
dody.
ms.
christine
y.
denson
yes,
afobest
herself,
the
girlfriend
who
was
present,
testified
and
the
discrepancy
between
what
he
had
to
say
and
what
part
of
the
confession
of
the
defendant
would
be
or
was
a
difference
in
who
struck
the
blow
with
a
knife.
she
said
the
defendant
did
it
and
that
she
only
stayed
there
because
she
was
scared
of
him.
the
defendant
said
that
she
got
the
blow
with
the
knife.
ms.
christine
y.
denson
it
was
the
frying
pan
that
killed
the
deceased.
the
medical
testimony
of
the
doctor
was
that
the
knife
wound
was
superficial
and
it
would
not
have
inflected
death.
ms.
christine
y.
denson
i
do
not
recall
from
the
record.
i
believe
--
ms.
christine
y.
denson
i
believe
it
is
t.m.
i
talked
to
captain
brucher
yesterday
about
the
matter.
in
short,
we
think
that
the
alleged
discrepancies
here
and
counsel
will
admit
that
he
cannot
take
for
sure
what
those
discrepancies
are,
are
not
important
discrepancies
in
this
case
and
for
the
court
to
use
this
case
as
a
step
to
take
a
very
giant
step
who
can
make
transcripts
available
to
defendants,
we
think
would
be
serious
miscarriage
of
justice.
as
the
court
has
pointed
out,
we
think
that
this
would
put
a
premium
a
mistrial,
not
only
of
course
do
the
disagreeing
jurors
cause
mistrials,
but
the
conduct
of
a
defendant
or
of
some
witness
or
even
if
some
police
officer,
as
we
had
in
our
state
where
the
policeman
will
put
defendants
in
handcuffs
in
view
of
the
jury
or
some
such
things
can
cause
a
mistrial.
if
the
defendant
has
some
key
testimony
and
his
attorney
has
not
known
about
it
before
and
he
does
not
like
what
his
attorney
does
and
(inaudible)
by
a
way
of
cross
examination
of
that
witness,
we
think
it
would
put
a
premium
on
the
mistrial
situation
for
him
to
cause
a
mistrial
knowing
that
he
could
get
a
free
transcript
from
the
state
and
have
that
available
for
his
attorney
on
the
next
trial
to
better
cross
examine
the
witnesses.
so
we
fear
that
result.
we
fear
also
of
course
the
overburdening
of
our
trial
courts.
we
make
transcripts
available
when
the
defendant
is
directly
appealing
on
collateral,
they
are
attacking
his
conviction.
we
feel
that
they
are
entitled
to
that.
in
north
carolina
we
have
done
that
voluntarily
on
the
smallest
offense,
but
to
recall
the
court
authority
to
delay
the
activities,
the
court
to
delay
the
preparation
of
transcripts
for
direct
appeals,
in
order
to
prepare
the
transcripts
of
the
mistrials
was
again
caused
the
delay
in
the
court
system
which
seriously
overburdened
the
reporting
of
our
own
state
courts
and
those
of
other
state
and
the
federal
courts
with
them.
for
that
reason
we
ask
the
court
not
to
take
that
step.
ms.
christine
y.
denson
yes.
i
do
not
have
the
statistics
--
ms.
christine
y.
denson
your
honor,
i
have
no
idea.
i
do
not
even
have
a
statistics
for
our
state.
ms.
christine
y.
denson
no
we
do
not,
but
we
think
that
this
--
ms.
christine
y.
denson
well,
your
honor,
far
from
those
that
we
have
now,
we
are
afraid
that
this
would
give
them
an
additional
reason
to
make
a
mistrial.
not
only
the
defendant
who
would
tend
to
be
disruptive
anyway,
but
the
defendant
who
knowing
that
he
has
got
a
transcript
available,
he
causes
a
mistrial
and
feels
for
some
reason
that
he
is
not
happy
with
counsel
and
could
do
better
the
next
time,
maybe
even
changing
counsel,
this
would
give
him
an
additional
reason
we
do
not
want.
ms.
christine
y.
denson
well,
i
do
not
think
anyone
knows
your
honor,
certainly
i
do
not.
i
do
not
know
the
incidents
now,
but
i
am
afraid
the
incidents
will
be
increased
and
this
is
our
great
theory.
we
think
that
the
defendant
on
a
showing
of
needs
might
be
entitled
to
a
transcript.
there
maybe
some
reason
that
the
court
reporter
is
not
available.
there
maybe
some
reason
of
a
key
state
witness
which
we
do
not
have
in
this
case
and
maybe
occasion
for
key
testimonies
that
he
does
want
to
check,
but
first
of
all
we
do
not
have
any
indication
in
this
case
that
he
could
not
have
secured
and
that
they
tried
and
secondly
we
do
not
have
identification
of
special
need
in
this
case.
ms.
christine
y.
denson
no.
i
think
the
essential
reason
our
court
said,
made
no
decision
with
the
first
reason
i
alluded
it
to
that
there
been
no
showing
that
he
had
not
had
the
court
reporter
available
to
call
and
that
there
is
no
showing
that
he
made
any
effort
to
make
use
of
that
formal
transcript
in
between
the
trial
and
for
that
reason
though
it
is
no
showing
of
needs.
ms.
christine
y.
denson
i
believe
judge
mao
did
discuss
since
i
urged
to
him
as
i
urge
to
this
court
today
that
the
point
at
which
they
were
alleged
discrepancies
which
fill
and
they
attended
on
minor.
ms.
christine
y.
denson
yes.
i
believe
there
was,
the
usual
motions
that
are
made
for
a
new
trial.
ms.
christine
y.
denson
i
think
that
you
(inaudible)
as
available.
ms.
christine
y.
denson
well,
yes
your
honor.
practically
i
think
the
time
for
doing
that
would
be
before
the
defendant
rested
this
case.
the
court
of
course
gives
him
time
to
get
ready
to
make
his
presentation
and
at
that
point
i
think
he
could
have
searched
his
memory
for
any
discrepancy
he
thought
there
was.
the
court
reporter
was
there
at
that
time
and
could
have
asked
for
a
recess
and
taken
two
years
the
time
for
this
court,
certainly
is
far
in
a
way
grater
delay
than
the
one
they
might
have
been
occasioned
by
getting
the
court
reporter
to
search
his
notes
and
although
i
cannot
say
this
to
the
court
with
certainty,
i
am
very
certain
the
court
would
have
allow
him
that
delay,
if
he
told
the
court
that
he
thought
there
were
discrepancies
and
he
wanted
to
see
what
the
reporter
might
show.
we
think
there
is
been
an
absence
by
the
defendants
of
any
showing
for
special
need
in
this
case
and
at
the
very
least
if
the
court
is
going
to
say
transcript
should
be
available,
we
think
that
that
ought
to
be
restricted
to
those
cases
where
there
is
some
sort
of
showing
the
need.
for
that
reason,
we
would
ask
the
court
not
to
extend
the
doctrine
on
transcript
and
to
say
that
in
the
case
of
mistrials,
they
remain
in
all
of
this,
they
are
not
important
for
that
objectively,
they
are
not
important
for
these
reasons
unless
there
is
some
special
need
in
the
case.
thank
you.
