number

britt
against
north
carolina.
mr.
bowers
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
long
did
that
first
trial
case
last?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
you
may
have
answered
one
question
(inaudible)
there
with
time
of
trial.
someone
questioned
you,
you
said
“you
could
not
have
put
him
on
the
stand”
what
would
present
to
in
calling
the
reporter,
putting
him
on
stand
and
i
asking
him
to
read
into
the
record
at
second
trial,
testimonies
that
he
had
taken
down
in
the
first
trial.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
you
conceivably
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
could
take
a
chance
if
you
were
sure
by
just
putting
him
on
to
clarify
the
record.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that
could
not
stop
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
suppose
that
it
is
often
done
counsel
and
i
have
done
it
myself
in
the
trial
of
cases,
to
call
the
reporter
from
prior
trial,
put
him
on
the
stand
and
read
the
testimony
of
a
particular
witness
or
some
other
aspect
of
the
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
do
i
understand
correctly
that
you
and
this
may
be
of
some
importance,
you
said,
if
you
had
asked
the
reporter
out
of
the
court,
he
would
have
read
back
any
part
of
notes
of
the
first
trial
if
he
wanted
to?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
that
does
not
quite
square
with
your
response
a
few
minutes
ago
that
if
you
had
asked
the
reporter
to
read
it,
you
would
have
got
it?
chief
justice
warren

burger
