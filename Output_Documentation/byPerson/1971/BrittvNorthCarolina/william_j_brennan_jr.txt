justice

what
you
have
to
do
is
talk
with
him
outside
the
courtroom,
outside
the
trial,
get
a
recess
or
something
after
you
heard
the
captain
testify
and
you
thought
he
had
testified
differently
at
the
first
trial,
you
can
then
go
to
reporter
and
say,
“hey,
i
think
i
remember
such
and
such
that
he
said.”

that
what
