mr.
robert
g.
bowers
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
chief
judge
of
the
north
carolina
court
of
appeals,
judge
raymond
mallard
makes
a
comment
frequently,
has
to
me,
that
every
case
that
he
sees
in
his
court
has
a
hooker
in
it.
while
i
was
noting
the
previous
argument
and
this
one
has
to
do
with
a
transcript,
but
it
has
a
little
bit
different
twist
to
it.
in
this
case,
different
from
the
previous
case,
the
defendant,
there
is
no
question
about
his
indigency
now
or
then.
he
is
now
in
state
prison,
a
young
man
who,
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
question
ever
raised
by
anybody,
that
he
was
absolutely
indigenous.
he
was
tried
in
a
trial
beginning
on
november
11.
he
was
not
convicted.
the
jury
verdict
was
never
reached.
there
was
a
mistrial
order
and
the
defendant
was
then
set
down
for
trial
again.
prior
to
the
second
trial,
very
shortly
after
the
first
trial
a
motion
was
filed
for
a
transcript.
you
will
find
the
order
of
mistrial
on
page
11
of
the
appendix.
the
affidavit
--
on
the
bottom
of
that
page
it
has
motion
for
transcript
which
of
course
obviously
is
an
affidavit
in
which
the
defendant
signed
an
affidavit
that
he
was
indigent,
that
i
had
advised
him
that
a
transcript
would
be
a
great
help
and
that
it
would
be
available
if
we
could
afford
to
pay
for
it.
the
motion
was
made
on
that
affidavit
which
was
summarily
denied
by
judge
fountain
(ph)
who
is
a
very
fine
and
gracious
judge
and
very
gifted
judge,
but
he
and
i
disagreed
on
this
but
it
was
a
matter
of
fact
without
argument
denied
to
which
the
defendant
accepted
and
this
is
the
crux
of
our
case
of
whether
or
not
the
defendant
was
entitled
to
a
transcript
of
the
evidentiary
portion
of
the
trial
which
commenced
on
november
11.
the
mistrial
was
ordered
on
november
14.
the
trial
--
the
jury
had
commenced
its
deliberation
at
9:30
on
that
morning.
there
where
three
days
of
trial.
now,
a
question
has
been
raised
in
the
previous
case
about
whether
or
not
counsel
could
reconstruct.
well,
there
again
we
have
a
peculiar
situation
here
in
which
we
do
not
need
to
have
the
reconstruction.
that
was
to
probably
done
for
purposes
of
an
appeal,
but
for
purposes
of
preparation
and
cross
examination
of
the
second
trial
this
we
thought
was
absolutely
essential.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
yes
sir,
both
for
that
and
for
investigative
purposes
prior
to
the
second
trial.
i
will
be
very
frank
on
this.
i
used
my
own
recollection
in
trying
to
investigate
what
had
been
brought
out
in
the
first
trial
and
i
do
not
know
that
i
made
many
errors
in
them,
but
it
would
have
still
been
most
helpful.
now,
commenting
collaterally
on
that,
after
the
second
trial
and
after
we
had
transcript
in
preparation
for
the
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
the
second,
of
the
second
trial.
we
have
never
seen
the
transcript
of
the
first
trial.
so
far
as
we
know
it
is
never
been
prepared
in
any
way
shape
form
or
matter.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
four
days.
well,
actually
three
days
of
trial
and
one
day
of
jury
deliberation.
i
do
not
want
to
lead
optimistically
the
court
in
anyway.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
yes
sir.
in
this
particular
case,
the
young
defendant,
i
say
young,
20-21
years
old
and
it
might
that
young,
was
charged
with
beating
his
girlfriend's
grandmother
to
death
with
a
frying
pan
in
an
effort
to
rob
her
of
her
worldly
possessions.
now,
whether
or
not
he
is
guilty
is
not
a
matter
that
is
before
this
court
or
was
never
subject
of
my
determination.
i
was
appointed
to
represent
him
and
i
hope
i
did
the
best
job
that
i
could
possibly
do,
but
be
that
as
it
maybe,
i
do
not
think
that
i
did
the
best
job
that
i
could
have
possibly
done
had
i
had
that
transcript.
it
is
difficult
to
argue
this
matter
in
this
court
and
try
to
put
this
court
back
in
the
courtroom
in
craven
county,
new
bern,
north
carolina,
where
the
fine
judge,
where
the
good
court,
the
courtrooms
are
fine
place
to
work.
there
is
one
witness
who
was
the
primary
witness
for
the
state,
a
captain
t.
m.
brucher
(ph)
of
new
bern
police
department.
now
captain
brucher
had
made
no
notes,
this
appears
in
the
transcript
which
is
before
you
or
the
record
which
is
before
you,
had
made
no
notes
of
any
kind,
type
or
description
with
respect
to
anything
that
he
had
done
in
connection
with
the
investigation
of
this
case.
yet
he
testified
that
he
had
spent
one
hour-and-a-half
at
the
scene,
but
if
you
will
read
the
testimony
as
elicited
in
the
second
trial,
you
will
find
that
he
did
not
account
for
more
than
five
minutes
of
his
time
list.
he
said
that
he
was
at
the
funeral
home
for
an
hour-and-a-half,
yet
he
had
made
no
notes.
he
said
--
he
testified
with
respect
to
the
arrest
of
the
defendant
without
a
warrant,
his
incarceration
without
a
warrant,
without
being
taken
before
a
magistrate.
he
testified
about
taking
him
out
of
jail
and
taking
him
back
to
the
detective
division
of
the
police
department
and
questioning.
oh!
yes
he
testified
that
he
calls
under
the
miranda.
he
testified
further
about
the
statements
made
to
him,
but
no
where
in
this
whole
procedure
had
he
ever
filed
a
first
note
with
his
supervisor,
where
had
he
made
the
first
note
for
his
records.
we
could
not
have
ask
to
examine
the
notes
that
he
had
made
under
the
jinks
rule,
we
could
not
have
done
anything.
the
only
thing
he
did
by
sitting
in
that
courtroom
was
a
folder
in
his
hand
which
we
found
to
contain
upon
questioning,
the
record
of
the
(inaudible).
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
t.m.
brucher.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
yes
sir.
now,
this
--
i
will
frankly
say
i
do
not
think
this
prejudiced
the
defendant
a
great
deal
in
his
defense
because
we
pointed
out
what
he
was
doing
and
i
think
it
probably
militated
more
against
him
than
it
did
in
his
favor.
i
am
trying
to
be
candid
about
this.
i
am
not
trying
to
say
that
the
prosecutor
was
guilty
of
any
misconduct
of
any
kind
type
or
description.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
no
sir.
he
did
not
or
if
he
did
i
did
not
know
about
it
and
i
do
not
think
that
he
did
and
he
was
very
honorable
man
and
he
is
and
i
am
sure
he
would
have
told
me
ahead,
in
fact
he
probably
would
have
handed
it
to
me
--
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
your
honor,
yes
sir,
the
reporter
was
available
to
us.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
yes
sir,
the
reporter
had
his
notes.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
it
would
have
necessitated
probably
a
day's
delay
for
him
to
go
get
his
notes.
now,
this
would
have,
had
he
brought
his
notes
to
court
with
him,
this
would
have
been
available.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
now,
one
motion,
one
moment
here
if
i
may,
excuse
me,
may
i
answer
your
question
to
that.
one
question
in
this,
you
see
that
motion
was
denied,
we
were
unable
to
get
a
hearing
on
the
motion,
it
was
denied
and
we
were
forced
to
go
immediately
within
ten
minutes
into
the
selection
of
the
jury.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
i
am
sure
he
would
have.
frankly
i
did.
i
am
not
trying
to
--
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
no
sir.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
this
is
correct.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
i
do
not
think
it
would
have
been
practical
at
all.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
yes
sir.
he
would
have,
but
there
again
my
problem
was
this.
had
he
read
me
those
notes,
it
would
still
would
have
not
furnished
me
the
need
that
i
had
for
cross
examination
later.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
no
sir
i
could.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
this
was
my
problem.
i
did
not
know
what
the
situation
would
be
until
it
arose
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
i
could
not
have
put
him,
i
did
answer
that
too
hastily,
i
could
not
have
put
him
on
stand
until
i
had
reviewed
what
he
had
to
testify
about.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
yes.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
of
course
there
would
have
been
the
problem.
he
was
also,
the
court
reporter
that
was
taking
this
at
the
trial.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
no,
i
agree
with
you
though,
it
would
have
been
inconvenient
but
it
would
not
have
stopped
it.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
no
sir.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
yes
sir.
my
problem
in
cross
examination,
if
that
would
have
been
rebuttal
testimony,
yes.
that
would
rebutted
what
he
said,
but
he
would
not
have
given
me
the
paper
that
would
have
said
now
on
such
and
such
date
did
you
not
testify
as
fallows
and
then
ask
it
and
was
your
answer
not
as
fallows.
now,
how
do
you
put
these
two
together,
how
do
you
get
your
position
that
your
answer
today
is
in
conformity
with
your
answer
before.
the
type
of
cross
examination
is
detailed,
of
course,
and
this
is
where
our
complaint
is,
not
with
the
fact
that
the
court
reporter
was
not
available
to
comeback
later
and
say
“oh!
no,
he
testified
this
way
on
that
date.”
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
yes
sir
and
i
say
this.
may
i
clarify
that
a
moment.
the
court
reporter
and
i
are
good
friends.
i
do
not
think
he
would
turn
down
my
request.
i
do
not
think
i
would
have
had
an
legal
standing
to
have
demanded
that
he
do
that.
not
in
our
system,
but
because
of
the
fact
that
the
court
reporter
in
a
small
eastern
north
carolina
town
is
usually
a
friend
of
all
the
lawyers,
i
could
have
asked
him
and
i
am
sure
that
he
would
have
accommodated
me
to
that
extent.
i
did
not,
maybe
i
should
have.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
approximately
about
--
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
yes
sir.
same
judge,
same
reporter,
same
counsel.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
different
jury
and
frankly
somewhat
different
testimony.
now,
i
will
say
this.
i
do
no
want
to
mislead
the
court
in
that
respect.
they
had
additional
witnesses
at
the
second
trial
that
had
not
been
in
the
first
trial.
i
am
not
trying
to
say
to
you
and
try
to
say
they
amended
a
lot
of
things
with
this
previous
testimony.
frankly
i
do
not
know
how
many
things
they
amended
because
i
have
been
not
to
read
the
transcript,
with
my
own
personal
recollection
that
is
all.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
it
does
not
tell
me
exactly
all
the
discrepancies
between
the
two
trials.
i
do
not
claim
to
have
perfectly
called.
i
wish
i
did,
but
i
do
not
and
i
frankly
do
not
believe
many
lawyers
do
and
i
think
that
this
is
a
very
necessary
element.
i
am
fully
well
aware
of
some
decisions
of
the
circuit
court
that
are
opposed
to
my
position.
i
am
perfectly
well
aware
of
ones
that
are
in
favor
of
my
position.
of
course
they
are
the
ones
i
would
like
to
argue
more
strenuously
than
the
three
that
i
found
that
are
opposed
and
i
am
sure
ms.
denson
will
argue
those
diligently.
however,
there
is
very
little
law.
i
am
not
going
into
the
griffin
case.
you
heard
that
i
am
sure
until
it
is
pending
out
--
well,
you
got
--
like
never
hear
that
again,
but
it
still
we
think
basic
law
that
justice
should
not
depend
upon
the
thickness
of
a
man’s
pocket
book.
and
if
a
transcript
was
available
to
me
or
to
anybody
else
that
had
a
pocket
thick
enough
to
pay
for
it,
it
sure
certainly
should
have
been
available
to
young
charles
w.
(inaudible).
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
i
am
saying
that
he
would
read
it
back
to
me,
but
having
in
writing
and
having
it
available
to
me
for
use
for
cross
examination,
i
would
not
have
been
able
to
obtain
that.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
--
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
no
sir,
it
would
not.
it
would
not
in
north
carolina
or
anywhere
that
i
had
dealings
with
grand
jury
testimony
because
that
made
available
to
the
state
nor
that
he
would
depend
on.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
it
is
completely
secret
hearing.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
it
was
available,
i
had
to
ask
for
it.
this,
the
state
could
have
gotten
it
merely
by
requesting
upon
the
court
reporter.
if
the
court
reporter
were
applied
to,
he
would
have
billed
the
state
--
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
we
have
--
frankly
we
do
not
have
court
reporters
at
preliminary
hearings
normally.
i
think
we
should,
but
unfortunately
we
do
not.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
yes
sir.
now,
i
might
say
this.
in
the
fourth
district
in
our
state,
the
judges
are
now
requiring
the
court
reporter
to
come
in
for
preliminary
hearings,
but
this
is
not
into
any
mandate
that
has
come
down.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
yes
sir,
they
certainly
would.
representing
the
defendant,
i
first
would
make
that
and
so
i
think
he
is
entitled
to
every
defense
that
is
available
to
anybody.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
i
do
not
think
it
is
a
factor
that
should
be
considered
in
this
particular
manner.
i
think
it
is
a
factor
naturally
in
the
actual
trial
because
there
is
a
certainty
fin
any
case,
any
lawyer
get
the
prior
cases
and
i
think
that
with
this
figure
he
can
go
to
the
second
trial
probably
better
than
the
first.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
i
think
that
the
state
would
argue
that
it
would,
but
i
do
not
think
so.
i
frankly
think
that
we
got
an
extra
judiciary
in
north
carolina
and
i
think
that
--
well
in
this
particular
case
we
had
no
transcript.
the
jury
stayed
out
one
day
and
the
mistrial
was
ordered.
this
was
not
matter
of
deciding
whether
a
transcript
would
be
made
available
or
not.
that
factor
never
entered
into
it.
the
court
had
found
they
were
hopelessly
in
deadlock.
so
far,
the
court
there
can
be
an
off
deck
--
cannot
be
a
mistrial
in
north
carolina
unless
a
judge
orders.
most
judges
require
the
jurors
to
sit
there
until
every
reasonable
hypothesis
had
been
pursued
and
they
are
satisfied
with
the
trial.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
i
think
not.
i
frankly
think
that
the
disruptive
tactics
that
has
been
followed
by
some
and
i
could
use
a
word
of
abbreviation
here,
but
i
think
i
better
leave
it
out,
some
who
are
not
as
ethical
as
others
and
some
who
are
trying
to
try
cases
other
than
a
legal
process
are
still
aware
and
hope
they
remain
aware.
i
hope
they
disappear
in
time,
but
i
do
not
think
that
this
particular
procedure
of
providing
transcript
would
encourage
that
in
anyway.
i
certainly
if
i
--
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
no
sir,
nothing
whatever.
and
in
fact
i
cannot
conceive
of
that
being
the
basic.
i
think
they
are
trying
to
be
political
rather
than
to
try
to
get
transcript.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
yes,
i
would
make
just
one
very,
rather
short
comment.
in
our
statute
which
appears
on
page
5
of
my
brief
78450,
sub
section
(b)
says
whenever
a
person
under
the
standards
and
procedure
set
out
in
this
sub
chapter
is
determined
to
be
an
indigent
person
entitled
to
counsel.
it
is
the
responsibility
of
the
state
to
provide
him
with
counsel
and
these
were
the
important
words,
and
the
other
necessary
expenses
of
representation.
i
was
about
to
point
that
out
to
court.
with
that
i
will
sit
down.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
chief
judge
of
the
north
carolina
court
of
appeals,
judge
raymond
mallard
makes
a
comment
frequently,
has
to
me,
that
every
case
that
he
sees
in
his
court
has
a
hooker
in
it.
while
i
was
noting
the
previous
argument
and
this
one
has
to
do
with
a
transcript,
but
it
has
a
little
bit
different
twist
to
it.
in
this
case,
different
from
the
previous
case,
the
defendant,
there
is
no
question
about
his
indigency
now
or
then.
he
is
now
in
state
prison,
a
young
man
who,
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
question
ever
raised
by
anybody,
that
he
was
absolutely
indigenous.
he
was
tried
in
a
trial
beginning
on
november
11.
he
was
not
convicted.
the
jury
verdict
was
never
reached.
there
was
a
mistrial
order
and
the
defendant
was
then
set
down
for
trial
again.
prior
to
the
second
trial,
very
shortly
after
the
first
trial
a
motion
was
filed
for
a
transcript.
you
will
find
the
order
of
mistrial
on
page
11
of
the
appendix.
the
affidavit
--
on
the
bottom
of
that
page
it
has
motion
for
transcript
which
of
course
obviously
is
an
affidavit
in
which
the
defendant
signed
an
affidavit
that
he
was
indigent,
that
i
had
advised
him
that
a
transcript
would
be
a
great
help
and
that
it
would
be
available
if
we
could
afford
to
pay
for
it.
the
motion
was
made
on
that
affidavit
which
was
summarily
denied
by
judge
fountain
(ph)
who
is
a
very
fine
and
gracious
judge
and
very
gifted
judge,
but
he
and
i
disagreed
on
this
but
it
was
a
matter
of
fact
without
argument
denied
to
which
the
defendant
accepted
and
this
is
the
crux
of
our
case
of
whether
or
not
the
defendant
was
entitled
to
a
transcript
of
the
evidentiary
portion
of
the
trial
which
commenced
on
november
11.
the
mistrial
was
ordered
on
november
14.
the
trial
--
the
jury
had
commenced
its
deliberation
at
9:30
on
that
morning.
there
where
three
days
of
trial.
now,
a
question
has
been
raised
in
the
previous
case
about
whether
or
not
counsel
could
reconstruct.
well,
there
again
we
have
a
peculiar
situation
here
in
which
we
do
not
need
to
have
the
reconstruction.
that
was
to
probably
done
for
purposes
of
an
appeal,
but
for
purposes
of
preparation
and
cross
examination
of
the
second
trial
this
we
thought
was
absolutely
essential.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
yes
sir,
both
for
that
and
for
investigative
purposes
prior
to
the
second
trial.
i
will
be
very
frank
on
this.
i
used
my
own
recollection
in
trying
to
investigate
what
had
been
brought
out
in
the
first
trial
and
i
do
not
know
that
i
made
many
errors
in
them,
but
it
would
have
still
been
most
helpful.
now,
commenting
collaterally
on
that,
after
the
second
trial
and
after
we
had
transcript
in
preparation
for
the
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
the
second,
of
the
second
trial.
we
have
never
seen
the
transcript
of
the
first
trial.
so
far
as
we
know
it
is
never
been
prepared
in
any
way
shape
form
or
matter.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
four
days.
well,
actually
three
days
of
trial
and
one
day
of
jury
deliberation.
i
do
not
want
to
lead
optimistically
the
court
in
anyway.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
yes
sir.
in
this
particular
case,
the
young
defendant,
i
say
young,
20-21
years
old
and
it
might
that
young,
was
charged
with
beating
his
girlfriend's
grandmother
to
death
with
a
frying
pan
in
an
effort
to
rob
her
of
her
worldly
possessions.
now,
whether
or
not
he
is
guilty
is
not
a
matter
that
is
before
this
court
or
was
never
subject
of
my
determination.
i
was
appointed
to
represent
him
and
i
hope
i
did
the
best
job
that
i
could
possibly
do,
but
be
that
as
it
maybe,
i
do
not
think
that
i
did
the
best
job
that
i
could
have
possibly
done
had
i
had
that
transcript.
it
is
difficult
to
argue
this
matter
in
this
court
and
try
to
put
this
court
back
in
the
courtroom
in
craven
county,
new
bern,
north
carolina,
where
the
fine
judge,
where
the
good
court,
the
courtrooms
are
fine
place
to
work.
there
is
one
witness
who
was
the
primary
witness
for
the
state,
a
captain
t.
m.
brucher
(ph)
of
new
bern
police
department.
now
captain
brucher
had
made
no
notes,
this
appears
in
the
transcript
which
is
before
you
or
the
record
which
is
before
you,
had
made
no
notes
of
any
kind,
type
or
description
with
respect
to
anything
that
he
had
done
in
connection
with
the
investigation
of
this
case.
yet
he
testified
that
he
had
spent
one
hour-and-a-half
at
the
scene,
but
if
you
will
read
the
testimony
as
elicited
in
the
second
trial,
you
will
find
that
he
did
not
account
for
more
than
five
minutes
of
his
time
list.
he
said
that
he
was
at
the
funeral
home
for
an
hour-and-a-half,
yet
he
had
made
no
notes.
he
said
--
he
testified
with
respect
to
the
arrest
of
the
defendant
without
a
warrant,
his
incarceration
without
a
warrant,
without
being
taken
before
a
magistrate.
he
testified
about
taking
him
out
of
jail
and
taking
him
back
to
the
detective
division
of
the
police
department
and
questioning.
oh!
yes
he
testified
that
he
calls
under
the
miranda.
he
testified
further
about
the
statements
made
to
him,
but
no
where
in
this
whole
procedure
had
he
ever
filed
a
first
note
with
his
supervisor,
where
had
he
made
the
first
note
for
his
records.
we
could
not
have
ask
to
examine
the
notes
that
he
had
made
under
the
jinks
rule,
we
could
not
have
done
anything.
the
only
thing
he
did
by
sitting
in
that
courtroom
was
a
folder
in
his
hand
which
we
found
to
contain
upon
questioning,
the
record
of
the
(inaudible).
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
t.m.
brucher.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
yes
sir.
now,
this
--
i
will
frankly
say
i
do
not
think
this
prejudiced
the
defendant
a
great
deal
in
his
defense
because
we
pointed
out
what
he
was
doing
and
i
think
it
probably
militated
more
against
him
than
it
did
in
his
favor.
i
am
trying
to
be
candid
about
this.
i
am
not
trying
to
say
that
the
prosecutor
was
guilty
of
any
misconduct
of
any
kind
type
or
description.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
no
sir.
he
did
not
or
if
he
did
i
did
not
know
about
it
and
i
do
not
think
that
he
did
and
he
was
very
honorable
man
and
he
is
and
i
am
sure
he
would
have
told
me
ahead,
in
fact
he
probably
would
have
handed
it
to
me
--
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
your
honor,
yes
sir,
the
reporter
was
available
to
us.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
yes
sir,
the
reporter
had
his
notes.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
it
would
have
necessitated
probably
a
day's
delay
for
him
to
go
get
his
notes.
now,
this
would
have,
had
he
brought
his
notes
to
court
with
him,
this
would
have
been
available.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
now,
one
motion,
one
moment
here
if
i
may,
excuse
me,
may
i
answer
your
question
to
that.
one
question
in
this,
you
see
that
motion
was
denied,
we
were
unable
to
get
a
hearing
on
the
motion,
it
was
denied
and
we
were
forced
to
go
immediately
within
ten
minutes
into
the
selection
of
the
jury.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
i
am
sure
he
would
have.
frankly
i
did.
i
am
not
trying
to
--
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
no
sir.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
this
is
correct.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
i
do
not
think
it
would
have
been
practical
at
all.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
yes
sir.
he
would
have,
but
there
again
my
problem
was
this.
had
he
read
me
those
notes,
it
would
still
would
have
not
furnished
me
the
need
that
i
had
for
cross
examination
later.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
no
sir
i
could.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
this
was
my
problem.
i
did
not
know
what
the
situation
would
be
until
it
arose
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
i
could
not
have
put
him,
i
did
answer
that
too
hastily,
i
could
not
have
put
him
on
stand
until
i
had
reviewed
what
he
had
to
testify
about.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
yes.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
of
course
there
would
have
been
the
problem.
he
was
also,
the
court
reporter
that
was
taking
this
at
the
trial.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
no,
i
agree
with
you
though,
it
would
have
been
inconvenient
but
it
would
not
have
stopped
it.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
no
sir.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
yes
sir.
my
problem
in
cross
examination,
if
that
would
have
been
rebuttal
testimony,
yes.
that
would
rebutted
what
he
said,
but
he
would
not
have
given
me
the
paper
that
would
have
said
now
on
such
and
such
date
did
you
not
testify
as
fallows
and
then
ask
it
and
was
your
answer
not
as
fallows.
now,
how
do
you
put
these
two
together,
how
do
you
get
your
position
that
your
answer
today
is
in
conformity
with
your
answer
before.
the
type
of
cross
examination
is
detailed,
of
course,
and
this
is
where
our
complaint
is,
not
with
the
fact
that
the
court
reporter
was
not
available
to
comeback
later
and
say
“oh!
no,
he
testified
this
way
on
that
date.”
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
yes
sir
and
i
say
this.
may
i
clarify
that
a
moment.
the
court
reporter
and
i
are
good
friends.
i
do
not
think
he
would
turn
down
my
request.
i
do
not
think
i
would
have
had
an
legal
standing
to
have
demanded
that
he
do
that.
not
in
our
system,
but
because
of
the
fact
that
the
court
reporter
in
a
small
eastern
north
carolina
town
is
usually
a
friend
of
all
the
lawyers,
i
could
have
asked
him
and
i
am
sure
that
he
would
have
accommodated
me
to
that
extent.
i
did
not,
maybe
i
should
have.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
approximately
about
--
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
yes
sir.
same
judge,
same
reporter,
same
counsel.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
different
jury
and
frankly
somewhat
different
testimony.
now,
i
will
say
this.
i
do
no
want
to
mislead
the
court
in
that
respect.
they
had
additional
witnesses
at
the
second
trial
that
had
not
been
in
the
first
trial.
i
am
not
trying
to
say
to
you
and
try
to
say
they
amended
a
lot
of
things
with
this
previous
testimony.
frankly
i
do
not
know
how
many
things
they
amended
because
i
have
been
not
to
read
the
transcript,
with
my
own
personal
recollection
that
is
all.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
it
does
not
tell
me
exactly
all
the
discrepancies
between
the
two
trials.
i
do
not
claim
to
have
perfectly
called.
i
wish
i
did,
but
i
do
not
and
i
frankly
do
not
believe
many
lawyers
do
and
i
think
that
this
is
a
very
necessary
element.
i
am
fully
well
aware
of
some
decisions
of
the
circuit
court
that
are
opposed
to
my
position.
i
am
perfectly
well
aware
of
ones
that
are
in
favor
of
my
position.
of
course
they
are
the
ones
i
would
like
to
argue
more
strenuously
than
the
three
that
i
found
that
are
opposed
and
i
am
sure
ms.
denson
will
argue
those
diligently.
however,
there
is
very
little
law.
i
am
not
going
into
the
griffin
case.
you
heard
that
i
am
sure
until
it
is
pending
out
--
well,
you
got
--
like
never
hear
that
again,
but
it
still
we
think
basic
law
that
justice
should
not
depend
upon
the
thickness
of
a
man’s
pocket
book.
and
if
a
transcript
was
available
to
me
or
to
anybody
else
that
had
a
pocket
thick
enough
to
pay
for
it,
it
sure
certainly
should
have
been
available
to
young
charles
w.
(inaudible).
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
i
am
saying
that
he
would
read
it
back
to
me,
but
having
in
writing
and
having
it
available
to
me
for
use
for
cross
examination,
i
would
not
have
been
able
to
obtain
that.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
--
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
no
sir,
it
would
not.
it
would
not
in
north
carolina
or
anywhere
that
i
had
dealings
with
grand
jury
testimony
because
that
made
available
to
the
state
nor
that
he
would
depend
on.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
it
is
completely
secret
hearing.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
it
was
available,
i
had
to
ask
for
it.
this,
the
state
could
have
gotten
it
merely
by
requesting
upon
the
court
reporter.
if
the
court
reporter
were
applied
to,
he
would
have
billed
the
state
--
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
we
have
--
frankly
we
do
not
have
court
reporters
at
preliminary
hearings
normally.
i
think
we
should,
but
unfortunately
we
do
not.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
yes
sir.
now,
i
might
say
this.
in
the
fourth
district
in
our
state,
the
judges
are
now
requiring
the
court
reporter
to
come
in
for
preliminary
hearings,
but
this
is
not
into
any
mandate
that
has
come
down.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
yes
sir,
they
certainly
would.
representing
the
defendant,
i
first
would
make
that
and
so
i
think
he
is
entitled
to
every
defense
that
is
available
to
anybody.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
i
do
not
think
it
is
a
factor
that
should
be
considered
in
this
particular
manner.
i
think
it
is
a
factor
naturally
in
the
actual
trial
because
there
is
a
certainty
fin
any
case,
any
lawyer
get
the
prior
cases
and
i
think
that
with
this
figure
he
can
go
to
the
second
trial
probably
better
than
the
first.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
i
think
that
the
state
would
argue
that
it
would,
but
i
do
not
think
so.
i
frankly
think
that
we
got
an
extra
judiciary
in
north
carolina
and
i
think
that
--
well
in
this
particular
case
we
had
no
transcript.
the
jury
stayed
out
one
day
and
the
mistrial
was
ordered.
this
was
not
matter
of
deciding
whether
a
transcript
would
be
made
available
or
not.
that
factor
never
entered
into
it.
the
court
had
found
they
were
hopelessly
in
deadlock.
so
far,
the
court
there
can
be
an
off
deck
--
cannot
be
a
mistrial
in
north
carolina
unless
a
judge
orders.
most
judges
require
the
jurors
to
sit
there
until
every
reasonable
hypothesis
had
been
pursued
and
they
are
satisfied
with
the
trial.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
i
think
not.
i
frankly
think
that
the
disruptive
tactics
that
has
been
followed
by
some
and
i
could
use
a
word
of
abbreviation
here,
but
i
think
i
better
leave
it
out,
some
who
are
not
as
ethical
as
others
and
some
who
are
trying
to
try
cases
other
than
a
legal
process
are
still
aware
and
hope
they
remain
aware.
i
hope
they
disappear
in
time,
but
i
do
not
think
that
this
particular
procedure
of
providing
transcript
would
encourage
that
in
anyway.
i
certainly
if
i
--
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
no
sir,
nothing
whatever.
and
in
fact
i
cannot
conceive
of
that
being
the
basic.
i
think
they
are
trying
to
be
political
rather
than
to
try
to
get
transcript.
mr.
robert
g.
bowers
yes,
i
would
make
just
one
very,
rather
short
comment.
in
our
statute
which
appears
on
page
5
of
my
brief
78450,
sub
section
(b)
says
whenever
a
person
under
the
standards
and
procedure
set
out
in
this
sub
chapter
is
determined
to
be
an
indigent
person
entitled
to
counsel.
it
is
the
responsibility
of
the
state
to
provide
him
with
counsel
and
these
were
the
important
words,
and
the
other
necessary
expenses
of
representation.
i
was
about
to
point
that
out
to
court.
with
that
i
will
sit
down.
