justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
other
words,
you
want
to
defend
this
with
the
evidence
of
the
state
witnesses
at
the
first
trial?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
cross
examine
if
they
testified
against
the
second
trial?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
bowers,
how
long
was
a
decree
to
a
trial?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
defended
in
both?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
bowers,
you
feel
that
the
fact
that
same
counsel
defended
in
both
trials
is
a
factor?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
if
we
were
to
go
along
with
you,
would
you
really
place
the
premium
on
mistrial?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
we
have
seen
a
lot
and
heard
a
lot
about
disruptive
tactics
in
the
courtroom.
i
wondered
if
a
ruling
in
your
favor
here
would
tend
to
promote
further
disruptions
or
a
counsel
can
get
a
transcript
to
the
first
trial
and
be
better
off
in
the
examination
of
witnesses
is
susceptible?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
if
you
have
nothing
of
this
kind
here?
