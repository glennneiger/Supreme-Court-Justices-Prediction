justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
lakusta,
we
have
--
i
take
it,
we're
approaching
this
case
on
the
assumption
that
the
allegation
is
in
the
complaint
is
true,
i
think.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
so
we
will
you
take
this
true
that
we
--
that
in
advance,
the
defendants
agreed
to
oppose
every
petition
of
the
time
listed
in
the
complaint.
we
got
without
ever
having
seen
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
--
and
i
take
as
they
did,
regardless
of
what
it
says.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
they
had
agreed
--
if
the
parties
had
agreed
to
bribe
one
of
the
commissioners
to
get
a
favorable
decision
in
order
to
monopolize
commerce,
would
you
have
a
different
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
it
be
(voice
overlap)
as
you
--
well,
i
know
it
that
it
might
be
--
there
might
be
duly
a
bribery
that
--
but
it
would
--
that
if
--
duly
of
a
sherman
act
violation,
if
they
did
it
to
--
did
it
by
subverting
the
--
the
adjudicatory
process
for
the
purpose
of
achieving
a
monopoly.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
you
accept
the
wood
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
where
if
you
agreed
to
file
false
information
with
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
now,
how
many
defendants
are
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
19,
they
don't
operate
on
the
same
area,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
think
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
every
single
defendant
--
every
single
defendant
who's
named
--
would
really
have
substantial
interest
in
every
single
petition
of
any
kind
that
was
ever
filed
before
the
puc
or
the
icc?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
what
interest
that
some
--
what
interest
would
a
operating
in
southern
california,
having
agreeing
with
b,
in
northern
california
for
b
to
help
him
oppose
and
help
--
and
jointly
to
finance
the
opposition
before
the
puc
of
a
transfer
of
some
operating
right
in
southern
california.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
interest
does
the
northern
california
men
does
in
contributing
to
--
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it's
--
it's
hard
to
conceive
that
out
of
--
there
were
500
petitions
filed,
there
wouldn't
be
a
single
one
of
them
that
was
meritorious.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
every
one
of
them
deserves
joint
--
jointly
commenced
doctrine.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
are
also,
isn't
that
the
base
of
the
matter
that
a
--
a
question
of
whether
the
puc,
if
it
--
in
taking
the
action,
can
--
well,
we'll
put
it
this
way,
assume
the
icc
or
the
puc
decided
to
reduce
the
number
of
carriers
in
a
certain
area,
the
one
given
the
monopoly.
how
can
it
--
how
can
a
state
puc
body
do
that
under
the
antitrust
law?
you
have
to
get
back
to
parker
don't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
didn't
say
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
state
can
authorize
private
individuals
to
violate
the
antitrust
laws
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
--
but
it
can
take
action
that
isn't
reached
by
the
--
by
the
antitrust
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
ask
for
an
injunction,
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
you
want
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
may
have
never
changed
that
policy.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
there
any
allegations
in
the
complaint
that
they
--
that
the
defendants
agreed
to
agree,
if
upon
what
--
on
what
transactions
not
to
oppose?
let's
assume
there
was
a
merger
proposed
between
one
of
the
defendants
and
some
smaller
carrier
or
something.
did
they
--
did
they
agree
among
themselves
not
to
(inaudible)
certain
--
certain
transactions
or
is
there
--
you
just
don't
allege
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
lakusta,
we
have
--
i
take
it,
we're
approaching
this
case
on
the
assumption
that
the
allegation
is
in

is
true,
i
think.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
so
we
will
you
take
this
true
that
we
--
that
in
advance,
the
defendants
agreed
to
oppose
every
petition
of
the
time
listed
in
the
complaint.
we
got
without
ever
having
seen
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
--
and
i
take
as
they
did,
regardless
of
what
it
says.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
they
had
agreed
--
if
the
parties
had
agreed
to
bribe
one
of
the

to
get
a

it
would

it
by

the

for

of

justice
byron

white
well,
then
you
accept
the
wood

where
if
you
agreed
to

with
the

justice
byron

yes.
justice
byron

yes.
justice

well
now,
how

in
