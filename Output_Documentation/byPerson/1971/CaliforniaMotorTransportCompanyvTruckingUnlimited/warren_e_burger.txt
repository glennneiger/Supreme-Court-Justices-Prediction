e.

we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
number
92,
california
motor
transport
company
against
trucking
unlimited.
mr.
lakusta,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
mr.
lakusta.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
this
respect
is
it
basically
fundamentally
any
different
from
collective
enterprises
by
working
men
or
collective
enterprises
of
trade
associations?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
--
this
is
in
fact
a
trade
association,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
a
trade
association
of
the
ins
against
the
outs.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
because
it's
cast
in
this
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
don't
you
have
to
--
don't
you
have
to
argue
to
make
your
case
look
even
--
with
this
first
amendment
rights
that
underlies
the
case
includes
the
right
to
act
in
bad
faith
and
for
improper
motives.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
improper
is
defined
by
the
sherman
act.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
we
--
we
don't
have
in
this
case
the
distance
where
there's
joint
efforts
to
persuade
a
governmental
body
or
an
administrative
due
simply
doesn't
have
power
to
do.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
this
is
essentially
the
same
as
though
a
newspaper
carried
a
box
on
the
front
page
saying,
“if
anyone
sues
us
for
libel
--
libel
by
virtue
of
what
we
say,
we
will
--
we
will
keep
them
in
litigation
for
years
and
it
will
not
be
profitable
to
sue
us
for
libel,
something
of
that
kind.
are
you
suggesting
this
first
amendment
right
is
the
same
as
this
hypothetical
i'm
giving
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
say
that
that's
what
your
point
for
doing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
allegation
as
distinguished
from
the
conclusion
as
--
and
inferences
drawn
from
those
allegations.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
you
consumed
your
entire
time,
mr.
lakusta.
mr.
khourie.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
to
every
adjudicatory
body
possessed
of
enhanced
powers
to
deal
with,
what
we
might
call
abuses
of
its
process.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
--
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
the
factor
that
backstops
this
situation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
isn't
that
enough
ground
without
the
sherman
act?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
good
arguments
could
be
made
advanced
if
you
ever
get
the
trial
in
this
case
on
the
part
of
your
opponents
that
it
is
not
in
the
public
interest
to
grant
all
applications.
somehow,
this
is
an
enormous
number
of
people
holding
certificates,
the
arguments
have
decided
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
extent,
a
further
argument
can
be
made,
they
serve
public
interest
by
keeping
the
operations
confined
to
strong
carriers.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
it's
almost
the
history
of
the
railroads
in
the
united
states,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
the
legislature
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
would
the
legislature
of
california
has
the
power
to
meet
your
problem
by
providing
that
after
one
hearing,
the
decision
of
the
utilities
commission
should
be
made
and
that
would
be
unreviewable
and
final.
and
--
and
then
there
could
be
no
harassment.
would
that
--
would
they
have
that
power?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that
would
be
a
solution
to
the
harassment
by
repetitive
appeals
and
that
sort
of
thing,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
not
sure
this
(voice

suggestion
a
good

it
(voice

of
