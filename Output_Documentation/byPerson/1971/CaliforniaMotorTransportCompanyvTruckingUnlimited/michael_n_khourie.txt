mr.
michael
n.
khourie
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
--
i
think
from
mr.
lakusta's
remarks
about
the
content
of
the
complaint,
it's
certainly
emphasized
in
my
mind
that
a
trial
is
needed
in
this
case
to
determine
what
this
plan
embraced,
whether
it
embraced
as
you
posited
this
ad
in
the
paper
saying,
“we'll
sue
anyone
or
whether
it
said
in
effect,
“if
you
sue
us,
we'll
defend
on
the
good
grounds.”
because
although
we
admit
in
our
complaint,
in
our
brief,
that
no
lies
were
told
because
we
don't
know
of
any.
we
do
not
say
that
relevant
information
was
given
in
all
protest
because
many
of
the
protests
were
made
without
any
cost
at
all.
we've
alleged
this
agreement
was
made
in
advance
at
one
point.
in
coronado
hotel,
in
1961,
in
san
diego
which
said
that,
“we
will
protest
each
and
every
application
irrespective
of
what
it
is,
where
its
location
is,
which
is
hereafter
filed
by
any
applicant.
now,
i
would
like
in
a
moment,
if
i
may,
to
review
the
--
what
i
believe,
the
allegation
clearly
to
say,
but
i
think
it's
important
that
at
least
that
i
communicate
to
this
court
that
what
the
charge
here
is
that
there
is
an
abuse
of
the
processes
by
which
government
receives
information
by
these
defendants
for
anticompetitive
purposes.
now,
the
processes
in
this
case
are
the
processes
which
follow
--
happens
to
be
the
way
that
was
set
up
for
certification.
the
processes
are
in
the
judicial
model.
we
have
filled
our
appendix
perhaps
over
full
with
regulatory
processes
--
processes
and
rules
which
show
that
it
isn't
a
judicial
model.
and
of
course,
it's
the
way
that
california
and
united
states
congress
and
legislature
has
set
up
certification.
this
is
done
because
these
are
individually
decided
cases,
based
upon
as
judge
browning
said
in
the
ninth
circuit,
“standards
of
more
or
less
generality,”
but
they
still
are
individually-decided
cases
which
much
more
are
in
the
--
not
in
the
political
rough
and
tumble
which
is
all
i
believe
that
noerr
dealt
with
and
that
all
noerr
meant
to
deal
with.
now,
the
processes
that
i'm
speaking
of
are
not
government
action,
they're
self-actuated.
in
other
words,
just
like
all
court
processes.
you
file
a
protest
and
things
start
happening
without
any
government
official
making
any
kind
of
a
decision.
and
those
things
are
things
which
cause
delay
and
expense.
and
it
is
knowledge
of
these
things
and
their
impact
on
competitors
which
the
defendants
relied
upon
to
harass
and
make
expensive
any
protest.
now,
when
a
notice
of
appeal
is
filed,
that's
just
things
in
a
motion
and
no
government
official
and
authority
has
made
any
kind
of
a
decision.
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
certainly
is,
mr.
chief
justice
burger.
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
it
is.
it's
the
--
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
because
it
is
a
--
the
abuse
of
the
judicial
process
was
--
was
designed
to
restrain
competition.
now,
i
don't
think
the
law
is
that
--
if
there
is
another
remedy
that
the
sherman
act
is
thereby
ousted
of
jurisdiction,
i
believe
that
with
--
unless
there's
a
specific
exemption
in
legislation
as
in
some
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
act
exemptions,
the
reed-bullwinkle
exemption
etcetera,
or
unless
there
is
an
implied
immunity
as
there
was
in
the
--
in
the
pan
american
case
where
there's
a
coalition
between
the
regulatory
scheme
and
the
antitrust
laws
or
unless
there's
a
parker
against
brown
type
of
immunity,
which
is
a
judge-created
immunity,
which
construe
the
sherman
act
not
to
apply
the
valid
state
action
or
unless
there's
a
kind
of
immunity
given
in
noerr-pennington.
i
do
believe
sincerely
that
there
is
no
immunity
for
tortfeasors
who
commit
other
torts
and
as
against
whom
a
competitor
may
have
a
tort
action
that
that
tortfeasor
is
thereby
entitled
to
an
immunity
from
the
sherman
act.
i
believe
the
--
the
sherman
act
is
a
law
of
general
application
and
you
can
violate
it
by
lawful
means
and
unlawful
means.
and
the
mere
fact
for
example
that
slander
is
perhaps
a
remedy
which
is
available,
or
perhaps
the
public
utilities
commission,
although
i
don't'
think
it
is
within
their
can
to
remedy
this
situation
because
they
would
have
to
have
a
hearing
on
standing
first,
to
see
if
there
is
probable
cause
for
this
person
to
be
there.
but
to
answer
your
question,
as
i
see
it,
i
don't
believe
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
regulatory
body
may
have
and
prospectively
i
might
say,
the
right
to
remedy
this
situation,
can
be
used
to
deny
these
defendants
the
right
to
certain
treble
damages
and
they
have
been
found
to
be
damaged.
and
i
don't
think
it
oust
the
federal
courts
of
jurisdiction.
i
don't
think
that
was
a
congressional
intent.
i
think
that
these
rules,
these
rules
which
are
actuated
by
private
citizens,
because
in
noerr,
you
have
the
--
you
have
two
things
in
noerr,
you
had
genuine
attempts
to
influence
government
for
the
purpose
of
restraining
trade.
and
that's
what
was
protected.
here,
there
are
no
genuine
attempts
in
our
view.
the
plan
cannot
be
segmented
between
those
applications
which
were
protested
and
which
there
was
probable
cause
and
those
applications
which
were
--
protests
and
which
there
were
none.
what
the
defendants
plan
embraced
was
to
protest
everything
and
to
appeal
everything
and
to
take
everything
to
the
highest
level
without
exception.
and
the
thing
that
separates
their
plan,
i
think
from
noerr,
is
that
they
knew
that
these
government
processes
they
were
using
would
act
directly
upon
--
upon
the
applicants.
and
they
also
knew
--
they
also
didn't
let
the
public
utilities
commission
know
of
their
plan,
nor
the
public,
nor
others.
they
let
their
competitors
know
--
they
let
their
competitors
know
that
as
we
say,
they
would
appeal
all
the
way.
the
plan
we
say
was
a
plan
which
was
devised
solely
to
deter
the
filing
of
applications.
it
wasn't
devised
for
any
other
reason
and
mr.
lakusta
is
incorrect
at
saying
that
we
alleged
that
the
plan
was
to
provide
information
to
government
in
every
case.
that's
not
what
we
alleged
at
all.
we
have
alleged
and
we
believe
that
we
can
prove
that
the
plan
was
to
deter
other
people
from
informing
government
and
from
coming
before
government
and
to
intensify
the
--
and
here
again,
we
admit
there's
a
burden
to
litigation.
there's
an
--
there's
a
burden
to
meeting
the
protests,
legitimate
protests
of
your
competitor,
but
the
plan
here
was
to
intensify
it
to
such
a
degree,
to
let
competitors
know
the
wealth
and
the
determination
and
the
binding
agreement
that
these
20
or
so
carriers
had
to
take
every
protest
and
--
and
they
protested
to
the
--
to
the
degree
that
they
did.
this
was
made
known
immediately
after
the
1961
meeting.
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
to
a
hearing,
yes,
it
does.
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
now,
there
are
other
--
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
that's
correct.
and
entitles
him
under
the
rules
to
a
rehearing.
entitles
him
to
bring
it
before
the
full
commission,
entitles
him
to
go
into
the
court
system,
entitles
him
to
appeal
to
the
--
to
the
highest
courts.
and
that
was
a
feature
of
a
plan.
that's
what
they
said
they
were
going
to
do.
it
was
in
effect
a
--
the
use
of
the
processes
to
terrorize,
i
believe,
the
competitors,
smaller
competitors
by
use
of
this
gigantic
force.
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
we
desire,
mr.
justice
brennan,
to
obtain
damages
for
them.
we
will
have
to
prove
under
the
applicable
rules
of
damages
that
the
impact
--
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
--
that
they
did
not
apply.
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
yes.
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
we
want
an
injunction.
yes,
we
do.
because
we
believe
that
the
policy
of
the
puc
have
not
changed.
the
policy
is
still
a
liberal
policy.
that's
why
we
say
they
have
subverted
the
policies
of
the
puc.
they've
done
it
by
employing
mechanisms
which
merely
are
expensive
in
--
in
coping
with.
we
do
not
believe
--
now,
the
point
is
made
that
they
made
the
best
case
possible
now,
in
every
case.
now,
obviously
they
did
because
we
believe
that
part
of
their
plan
and
the
plan
couldn't
have
been
effective,
must
they
went
before
the
commission
with
competent
counsel,
which
they
did.
they
made
every
argument
conceivable,
which
they
did.
and
i
submit
that
even
if
they
--
that
there's
no
probable
cause
whatsoever
to
our
position
that
counsel
can
always
think
of
arguments,
always
arguments,
but
the
basic
purpose
was
there
and
the
result
on
a
policy
basis
was
that
information
stopped
flowing
to
government.
because
if
you
--
in
1961,
if
you
can
take
that
breath
of
hands
that
were
--
these
many
applications.
and
--
and
there
was
the
right
to
protest.
and
information
was
flowing
to
government.
in
1962,
there
were
that
many
applications
and
information
to
that
extent
was
flowing
to
government.
in
1964
and
1965
this
--
with
these
many
applications
and
to
that
extent,
information
the
government
was
being
curtailed.
it
got
to
the
point
where
no
information
was
flowing
to
government.
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
extremely
few.
it
--
i
can
tell
you
that
we
can
prove
in
my
opinion
that
applications
went
from
a
level
of
pure
competition
because
the
policy
of
the
public
utilities
commission
was
that
they
were
going
to
grant
virtually
every
application
upon
a
showing
of
fitness.
they
had
adopted
and
the
--
and
in
our
brief,
we
cite
opinions
of
the
public
utilities
commission,
where
they
have
adopted
a
policy
of
open
competition.
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
we
have
--
we
do
not
believe
they
had
changed
that
policy.
we
believe
that
applications
have
dried
up
and
we
believe
we
can
prove
that
applications
have
dried
up.
we
can
prove
that
applications
have
dried
up.
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
we
allege
that
mr.
justice
white,
that
the
--
they
agree
to
oppose
applications
for
certificates,
applications
to
transfer
certificates
and
applications
to
register
certificates
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
and
those
are
the
--
and
they
agreed
to
oppose
all
of
their
applications.
and
as
far
as
we
know,
they
didn't
agree
to
--
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
--
do
anything
else.
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
well,
they
could
but
that
--
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
well,
any
monopolist,
i
suppose,
could
take
that
position
and
perhaps
they
sincerely
feel
that
that
is
a
correct
position.
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
that's
correct,
your
--
your
honor.
however,
i
think,
that's
the
job
of
the
commission
and
not
these
defendants.
the
defendants
have,
i
believe
in
california
taken
over
the
job
of
regulating
carriers.
and
they've
done
so
by
--
they
don't
have
to
bribe.
they're
too
powerful
to
have
to
bribe
or
too
powerful
to
have
to
lie.
they
have
taken
this
power
and
they
have
used
and
abused
a
procedure,
a
delicate
proceeding
of
government,
which
is
not
the
noerr-pennington
type
of
behavior.
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
that's
right.
i
believe
that
the
court
in
noerr
held
that
the
values
protectable
in
the
--
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
--
in
the
political
process
where
a
representative
government
is
involved
and
where
the
free
access
to
--
to
the
elected
representative
of
people
in
the
manner
in
which
it
was
achieved
in
noerr,
was
protected
by
the
right
to
petition
government.
noerr
did
have,
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
caution
that
there
must
be
a
genuine
effort
to
influence
government.
in
other
words,
no
doubt
in
noerr,
there's
no
doubt
in
pennington
that
the
defendants
there
sought
to
have
the
government
do
their
restraining
for
them.
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
genuine
effort.
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
the
--
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
yes.
the
effort
in
this
case
was
not
to
have
government
restrain
trade.
the
effort
in
this
case
was
to
make
the
processes
of
government
and
i'm
talking
about
these
self-initiating
processes
where
a
government
doesn't
have
to
act
at
all
in
a
decision
making
kind
of
--
kind
of
a
proceeding,
whereby
filing
a
protest,
there's
a
hearing,
but
filing
a
petition
for
rehearing,
there
has
to
be
another
hearing.
that's
what
has
restrained
trade
in
this
case
and
not
the
decisions
of
the
governmental
body
--
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
that's
correct.
this
is
an
abuse
case.
it's
an
abuse
of
process.
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
we
know
of
none.
but
we
do
not
--
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
we
do
not
say
by
that,
that
there
was
always
relevant
information
given
that
mr.
lakusta
has
argued.
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
well,
there
are
always
objections
found
--
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
(voice
overlap)
excuse
me.
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
it
could.
the
--
the
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
public
utilities
committee
--
commission
is
a
creature
of
the
legislature
of
california.
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
it
would
be
a
--
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
--
prospective
goods
--
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
--
and
it
would
be
a
prospective
solution
which
might
be
achieved
by
lobbying
and
by
persuading
the
legislature,
which
incidentally,
these
defendants
could
have
tried
to
achieve
this
liberal
policy
that
erred
this
shortening
of
a
liberal
policy
that
they
objected
to.
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
no.
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
exactly.
no
--
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
--
prospectively,
i'd
--
i
believe
that
--
well,
prospectively,
there's
no
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
you're
right.
but
for
--
and
i
don't
think
that
the
antitrust
laws
would
--
would
or
could
apply
in
that
situation.
however,
in
the
situation
we
have
found
ourselves
in,
where
the
legislature
has
decided
to
put
this
certificating
function
into
the
hands
of
the
public
utilities
commission
and
has
decided
to
make
certification
and
adjudicating
procedure.
it
didn't
have
to
do
that,
but
it
did
that.
and
it
isn't
adjudicated
procedure.
and
they
set
up
the
rules
of
procedure
which
have
to
be
followed.
and
these
are
--
we
believe
that
these
--
the
abuse
of
these
procedures
for
anticompetitive
purposes
have
put
these
defendants
forever
within
the
sherman
act.
certainly,
the
mere
fact
their
public
utilities
is
subject
to
regulation
and
certainly,
the
mere
fact
that
their
may
be
pervasive
regulation
does
not
immunize
them
from
the
sherman
act.
we
believe
and
we
argue
that
sherman
act
is
applicable
to
them
and
that
they
are
just
like
any
other
defendants
because
they
chose
this
method.
they
might
have
chosen
lobbying
and
then
protected
by
noerr,
but
they
did
not
choose
the
noerr
method.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
--
i
think
from
mr.
lakusta's
remarks
about
the
content
of
the
complaint,
it's
certainly
emphasized
in
my
mind
that
a
trial
is
needed
in
this
case
to
determine
what
this
plan
embraced,
whether
it
embraced
as
you
posited
this
ad
in
the
paper
saying,
“we'll
sue
anyone
or
whether
it
said
in
effect,
“if
you
sue
us,
we'll
defend
on
the
good
grounds.”
because
although
we
admit
in
our
complaint,
in
our
brief,
that
no
lies
were
told
because
we
don't
know
of
any.
we
do
not
say
that
relevant
information
was
given
in
all
protest
because
many
of
the
protests
were
made
without
any
cost
at
all.
we've
alleged
this
agreement
was
made
in
advance
at
one
point.
in
coronado
hotel,
in
1961,
in
san
diego
which
said
that,
“we
will
protest
each
and
every
application
irrespective
of
what
it
is,
where
its
location
is,
which
is
hereafter
filed
by
any
applicant.
now,
i
would
like
in
a
moment,
if
i
may,
to
review
the
--
what
i
believe,
the
allegation
clearly
to
say,
but
i
think
it's
important
that
at
least
that
i
communicate
to
this
court
that
what
the
charge
here
is
that
there
is
an
abuse
of
the
processes
by
which
government
receives
information
by
these
defendants
for
anticompetitive
purposes.
now,
the
processes
in
this
case
are
the
processes
which
follow
--
happens
to
be
the
way
that
was
set
up
for
certification.
the
processes
are
in
the
judicial
model.
we
have
filled
our
appendix
perhaps
over
full
with
regulatory
processes
--
processes
and
rules
which
show
that
it
isn't
a
judicial
model.
and
of
course,
it's
the
way
that
california
and
united
states
congress
and
legislature
has
set
up
certification.
this
is
done
because
these
are
individually
decided
cases,
based
upon
as
judge
browning
said
in
the
ninth
circuit,
“standards
of
more
or
less
generality,”
but
they
still
are
individually-decided
cases
which
much
more
are
in
the
--
not
in
the
political
rough
and
tumble
which
is
all
i
believe
that
noerr
dealt
with
and
that
all
noerr
meant
to
deal
with.
now,
the
processes
that
i'm
speaking
of
are
not
government
action,
they're
self-actuated.
in
other
words,
just
like
all
court
processes.
you
file
a
protest
and
things
start
happening
without
any
government
official
making
any
kind
of
a
decision.
and
those
things
are
things
which
cause
delay
and
expense.
and
it
is
knowledge
of
these
things
and
their
impact
on
competitors
which
the
defendants
relied
upon
to
harass
and
make
expensive
any
protest.
now,
when
a
notice
of
appeal
is
filed,
that's
just
things
in
a
motion
and
no
government
official
and
authority
has
made
any
kind
of
a
decision.
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
certainly
is,
mr.
chief
justice
burger.
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
it
is.
it's
the
--
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
because
it
is
a
--
the
abuse
of
the
judicial
process
was
--
was
designed
to
restrain
competition.
now,
i
don't
think
the
law
is
that
--
if
there
is
another
remedy
that
the
sherman
act
is
thereby
ousted
of
jurisdiction,
i
believe
that
with
--
unless
there's
a
specific
exemption
in
legislation
as
in
some
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
act
exemptions,
the
reed-bullwinkle
exemption
etcetera,
or
unless
there
is
an
implied
immunity
as
there
was
in
the
--
in
the
pan
american
case
where
there's
a
coalition
between
the
regulatory
scheme
and
the
antitrust
laws
or
unless
there's
a
parker
against
brown
type
of
immunity,
which
is
a
judge-created
immunity,
which
construe
the
sherman
act
not
to
apply
the
valid
state
action
or
unless
there's
a
kind
of
immunity
given
in
noerr-pennington.
i
do
believe
sincerely
that
there
is
no
immunity
for
tortfeasors
who
commit
other
torts
and
as
against
whom
a
competitor
may
have
a
tort
action
that
that
tortfeasor
is
thereby
entitled
to
an
immunity
from
the
sherman
act.
i
believe
the
--
the
sherman
act
is
a
law
of
general
application
and
you
can
violate
it
by
lawful
means
and
unlawful
means.
and
the
mere
fact
for
example
that
slander
is
perhaps
a
remedy
which
is
available,
or
perhaps
the
public
utilities
commission,
although
i
don't'
think
it
is
within
their
can
to
remedy
this
situation
because
they
would
have
to
have
a
hearing
on
standing
first,
to
see
if
there
is
probable
cause
for
this
person
to
be
there.
but
to
answer
your
question,
as
i
see
it,
i
don't
believe
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
regulatory
body
may
have
and
prospectively
i
might
say,
the
right
to
remedy
this
situation,
can
be
used
to
deny
these
defendants
the
right
to
certain
treble
damages
and
they
have
been
found
to
be
damaged.
and
i
don't
think
it
oust
the
federal
courts
of
jurisdiction.
i
don't
think
that
was
a
congressional
intent.
i
think
that
these
rules,
these
rules
which
are
actuated
by
private
citizens,
because
in
noerr,
you
have
the
--
you
have
two
things
in
noerr,
you
had
genuine
attempts
to
influence
government
for
the
purpose
of
restraining
trade.
and
that's
what
was
protected.
here,
there
are
no
genuine
attempts
in
our
view.
the
plan
cannot
be
segmented
between
those
applications
which
were
protested
and
which
there
was
probable
cause
and
those
applications
which
were
--
protests
and
which
there
were
none.
what
the
defendants
plan
embraced
was
to
protest
everything
and
to
appeal
everything
and
to
take
everything
to
the
highest
level
without
exception.
and
the
thing
that
separates
their
plan,
i
think
from
noerr,
is
that
they
knew
that
these
government
processes
they
were
using
would
act
directly
upon
--
upon
the
applicants.
and
they
also
knew
--
they
also
didn't
let
the
public
utilities
commission
know
of
their
plan,
nor
the
public,
nor
others.
they
let
their
competitors
know
--
they
let
their
competitors
know
that
as
we
say,
they
would
appeal
all
the
way.
the
plan
we
say
was
a
plan
which
was
devised
solely
to
deter
the
filing
of
applications.
it
wasn't
devised
for
any
other
reason
and
mr.
lakusta
is
incorrect
at
saying
that
we
alleged
that
the
plan
was
to
provide
information
to
government
in
every
case.
that's
not
what
we
alleged
at
all.
we
have
alleged
and
we
believe
that
we
can
prove
that
the
plan
was
to
deter
other
people
from
informing
government
and
from
coming
before
government
and
to
intensify
the
--
and
here
again,
we
admit
there's
a
burden
to
litigation.
there's
an
--
there's
a
burden
to
meeting
the
protests,
legitimate
protests
of
your
competitor,
but
the
plan
here
was
to
intensify
it
to
such
a
degree,
to
let
competitors
know
the
wealth
and
the
determination
and
the
binding
agreement
that
these
20
or
so
carriers
had
to
take
every
protest
and
--
and
they
protested
to
the
--
to
the
degree
that
they
did.
this
was
made
known
immediately
after
the
1961
meeting.
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
to
a
hearing,
yes,
it
does.
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
now,
there
are
other
--
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
that's
correct.
and
entitles
him
under
the
rules
to
a
rehearing.
entitles
him
to
bring
it
before
the
full
commission,
entitles
him
to
go
into
the
court
system,
entitles
him
to
appeal
to
the
--
to
the
highest
courts.
and
that
was
a
feature
of
a
plan.
that's
what
they
said
they
were
going
to
do.
it
was
in
effect
a
--
the
use
of
the
processes
to
terrorize,
i
believe,
the
competitors,
smaller
competitors
by
use
of
this
gigantic
force.
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
we
desire,
mr.
justice
brennan,
to
obtain
damages
for
them.
we
will
have
to
prove
under
the
applicable
rules
of
damages
that
the
impact
--
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
--
that
they
did
not
apply.
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
yes.
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
we
want
an
injunction.
yes,
we
do.
because
we
believe
that
the
policy
of
the
puc
have
not
changed.
the
policy
is
still
a
liberal
policy.
that's
why
we
say
they
have
subverted
the
policies
of
the
puc.
they've
done
it
by
employing
mechanisms
which
merely
are
expensive
in
--
in
coping
with.
we
do
not
believe
--
now,
the
point
is
made
that
they
made
the
best
case
possible
now,
in
every
case.
now,
obviously
they
did
because
we
believe
that
part
of
their
plan
and
the
plan
couldn't
have
been
effective,
must
they
went
before
the
commission
with
competent
counsel,
which
they
did.
they
made
every
argument
conceivable,
which
they
did.
and
i
submit
that
even
if
they
--
that
there's
no
probable
cause
whatsoever
to
our
position
that
counsel
can
always
think
of
arguments,
always
arguments,
but
the
basic
purpose
was
there
and
the
result
on
a
policy
basis
was
that
information
stopped
flowing
to
government.
because
if
you
--
in
1961,
if
you
can
take
that
breath
of
hands
that
were
--
these
many
applications.
and
--
and
there
was
the
right
to
protest.
and
information
was
flowing
to
government.
in
1962,
there
were
that
many
applications
and
information
to
that
extent
was
flowing
to
government.
in
1964
and
1965
this
--
with
these
many
applications
and
to
that
extent,
information
the
government
was
being
curtailed.
it
got
to
the
point
where
no
information
was
flowing
to
government.
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
extremely
few.
it
--
i
can
tell
you
that
we
can
prove
in
my
opinion
that
applications
went
from
a
level
of
pure
competition
because
the
policy
of
the
public
utilities
commission
was
that
they
were
going
to
grant
virtually
every
application
upon
a
showing
of
fitness.
they
had
adopted
and
the
--
and
in
our
brief,
we
cite
opinions
of
the
public
utilities
commission,
where
they
have
adopted
a
policy
of
open
competition.
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
we
have
--
we
do
not
believe
they
had
changed
that
policy.
we
believe
that
applications
have
dried
up
and
we
believe
we
can
prove
that
applications
have
dried
up.
we
can
prove
that
applications
have
dried
up.
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
we
allege
that
mr.
justice
white,
that
the
--
they
agree
to
oppose
applications
for
certificates,
applications
to
transfer
certificates
and
applications
to
register
certificates
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
and
those
are
the
--
and
they
agreed
to
oppose
all
of
their
applications.
and
as
far
as
we
know,
they
didn't
agree
to
--
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
--
do
anything
else.
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
well,
they
could
but
that
--
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
well,
any
monopolist,
i
suppose,
could
take
that
position
and
perhaps
they
sincerely
feel
that
that
is
a
correct
position.
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
that's
correct,
your
--
your
honor.
however,
i
think,
that's
the
job
of
the
commission
and
not
these
defendants.
the
defendants
have,
i
believe
in
california
taken
over
the
job
of
regulating
carriers.
and
they've
done
so
by
--
they
don't
have
to
bribe.
they're
too
powerful
to
have
to
bribe
or
too
powerful
to
have
to
lie.
they
have
taken
this
power
and
they
have
used
and
abused
a
procedure,
a
delicate
proceeding
of
government,
which
is
not
the
noerr-pennington
type
of
behavior.
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
that's
right.
i
believe
that
the
court
in
noerr
held
that
the
values
protectable
in
the
--
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
--
in
the
political
process
where
a
representative
government
is
involved
and
where
the
free
access
to
--
to
the
elected
representative
of
people
in
the
manner
in
which
it
was
achieved
in
noerr,
was
protected
by
the
right
to
petition
government.
noerr
did
have,
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
caution
that
there
must
be
a
genuine
effort
to
influence
government.
in
other
words,
no
doubt
in
noerr,
there's
no
doubt
in
pennington
that
the
defendants
there
sought
to
have
the
government
do
their
restraining
for
them.
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
genuine
effort.
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
the
--
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
yes.
the
effort
in
this
case
was
not
to
have
government
restrain
trade.
the
effort
in
this
case
was
to
make
the
processes
of
government
and
i'm
talking
about
these
self-initiating
processes
where
a
government
doesn't
have
to
act
at
all
in
a
decision
making
kind
of
--
kind
of
a
proceeding,
whereby
filing
a
protest,
there's
a
hearing,
but
filing
a
petition
for
rehearing,
there
has
to
be
another
hearing.
that's
what
has
restrained
trade
in
this
case
and
not
the
decisions
of
the
governmental
body
--
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
that's
correct.
this
is
an
abuse
case.
it's
an
abuse
of
process.
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
we
know
of
none.
but
we
do
not
--
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
we
do
not
say
by
that,
that
there
was
always
relevant
information
given
that
mr.
lakusta
has
argued.
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
well,
there
are
always
objections
found
--
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
(voice
overlap)
excuse
me.
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
it
could.
the
--
the
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
public
utilities
committee
--
commission
is
a
creature
of
the
legislature
of
california.
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
it
would
be
a
--
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
--
prospective
goods
--
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
--
and
it
would
be
a
prospective
solution
which
might
be
achieved
by
lobbying
and
by
persuading
the
legislature,
which
incidentally,
these
defendants
could
have
tried
to
achieve
this
liberal
policy
that
erred
this
shortening
of
a
liberal
policy
that
they
objected
to.
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
no.
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
exactly.
no
--
mr.
michael
n.
khourie
--
prospectively,
i'd
--
i
believe
that
--
well,
prospectively,
there's
no
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
you're
right.
but
for
--
and
i
don't
think
that
the
antitrust
laws
would
--
would
or
could
apply
in
that
situation.
however,
in
the
situation
we
have
found
ourselves
in,
where
the
legislature
has
decided
to
put
this
certificating
function
into
the
hands
of
the
public
utilities
commission
and
has
decided
to
make
certification
and
adjudicating
procedure.
it
didn't
have
to
do
that,
but
it
did
that.
and
it
isn't
adjudicated
procedure.
and
they
set
up
the
rules
of
procedure
which
have
to
be
followed.
and
these
are
--
we
believe
that
these
--
the
abuse
of
these
procedures
for
anticompetitive
purposes
have
put
these
defendants
forever
within
the
sherman
act.
certainly,
the
mere
fact
their
public
utilities
is
subject
to
regulation
and
certainly,
the
mere
fact
that
their
may
be
pervasive
regulation
does
not
immunize
them
from
the
sherman
act.
we
believe
and
we
argue
that
sherman
act
is
applicable
to
them
and
that
they
are
just
like
any
other
defendants
because
they
chose
this
method.
they
might
have
chosen
lobbying
and
then
protected
by
noerr,
but
they
did
not
choose
the
noerr
method.
thank
you
very
much.
