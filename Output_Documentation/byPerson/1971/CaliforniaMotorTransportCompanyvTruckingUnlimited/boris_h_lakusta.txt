mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
--
the
issue
in
this
proceeding
is
whether
the
--
the
facts
in
a
treble
damage
antitrust
complaint,
constitute
a
violation
on
--
under
the
sherman
act.
in
this
case,
a
--
a
group
of
15
certificated
motor
carriers
brought
the
complaint
against
a
group
of
19
motor
carriers,
certificated
motor
carriers,
alleging
that
the
defendant
had
violated
the
sherman
act.
the
complaint
was
amended
and
the
first
amended
complaint
is
one
with
which
we
are
concerned.
i
--
i
shall
refer
to
it
simply
as
the
complaint.
we
move
to
dismiss
it
on
the
ground
that
it
fails
to
state
a
cause
of
action
under
the
sherman
act.
judge
sweigert
of
the
federal
district
court
agreed
with
our
position
and
wrote
a
really
extensive
opinion.
in
support
of
his
views,
he
gave
the
plaintiff
an
opportunity
to
amend
and
they
did
not
avail
themselves
about
and
instead
appealed
to
the
ninth
circuit.
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
by
a
2-to-1
vote.
the
dissenting
judge,
senior
judge
hamlin,
wrote
a
separate
dissenting
opinion.
we
then
petitioned
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
this
court.
now,
i
turn
to
the
complaint
and
we'll
summarize
the
--
the
fact
which
it
alleges.
that
alleges
that
these
defending
carriers
got
together
in
early
1961
and
agreed
on
a
program
of
protesting
all
certificate
proceedings
which
might
result
in
competition
to
the
defendant.
all
certificate
proceedings
brought
before
either
the
interstate
commerce
commission
or
the
california
public
utilities
commission.
the
program
was
to
include
court
review
in
the
event
the
protest
before
the
administrative
body
should
prove
unsuccessful.
the
allegation
is
that
the
defendants
agreed
to
finance
a
program
jointly,
under
an
arrangement
under
which
each
carrier
would
contribute
monthly,
a
sum
based
on
his
gross
annual
revenues,
rather
than
according
to
his
interest
or
participation
in
any
given
case.
the
agreement
was
that
the
program
should
be
publicized
to
the
carrier
industry.
the
complaint
goes
on
to
allege
that
the
agreement
was
carried
out
and
has
been
carried
out
consistently
since
1961.
as
to
purpose,
the
allegation
is
that
the
agreement
and
program
were
designed
to
reduce
or
eliminate
competition
and
that
to
achieve
that
--
that
anticompetitive
result,
the
complaint
alleges
if
we
accept
plaintiff's
version,
which
i
think
we
must,
for
purposes
of
this
case,
that
in
defendant's
primary
intent
was
to
use
the
words
of
the
complaint,
to
discourage
and
deter
the
plaintiff
and
others
in
like
position
from
filing
certificate
applications
or
from
pursuing
those
applications,
was
they
did
file.
in
this
connection,
the
--
the
plaintiff
say
that
defendants
--
that
the
defending
carriers
intended
to
make
as
effective,
a
presentation
in
each
case
before
the
relevant
commission
as
possible.
in
fact
they
recognized
that
such
an
intent
was
essential
to
the
primary
purpose
of
giving
authority
to
the
desire
to
discourage
or
deter
plaintiffs
and
others
in
the
like
position
from
coming
before
the
commission.
there's
no
--
there's
no
suggestion
in
the
complaint
that
the
defendants
were,
at
anytime,
guilty
of
dishonesty
or
deception.
there
is
no
suggestion
in
the
complaint
that
the
defendant
at
anytime
offers
false
or
irrelevant
testimony.
i
would
like
to
turn
now
to
the
reasons
why
we
believe
the
sherman
act
should
--
should
not
be
extended
to
the
fact
that's
alleged.
the
two
cases
on
which
we
chiefly
rely
are
eastern
railroad
conference
versus
noerr,
decided
in
1961
by
this
court.
it
--
it
was
a
unanimous
decision
and
justice
black
wrote
the
decision.
the
other
case
since
united
mine
workers
versus
pennington,
decided
four
years
later
in
1965.
mr.
justice
white
wrote
the
opinion
for
the
majority
in
that
case.
we
start
with
a
proposition
in
noerr
that
a
restraint
imposed
by
government
is
immune
from
the
antitrust
act.
that
has
been
held
in
parker
versus
brown
and
u.s.
versus
royal
rock.
it
would
seem
to
follow
that
--
reason
to
believe
that
the
efforts
to
influence
government
to
impose
such
governmental
restraint
should
also
be
immune
from
the
sherman
act.
i
think
that
is
at
least
in
broad
terms,
the
--
the
holding
in
--
in
noerr
and
in
pennington.
the
joint
efforts
involved
in
noerr
were
efforts
to
influence
at
least
one
state
governor
and
more
than
one
state
legislature
and
also
certain
law
enforcement
agencies.
the
joint
effort
in
pennington
involved
joint
efforts
to
influence
the
secretary
of
labor
and
officials
of
the
tennessee
valley
authority.
now,
the
noerr
case
sets
for
three
reasons
for
holding
that
the
sherman
act
should
not
apply
to
these
joint
efforts.
the
first
reason
was
essential
dissimilarity.
in
other
words
that
appeals
to
governmental
bodies
are
essentially
dissimilar
from
a
kind
of
--
of
trade
restraint
which
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
enacted
the
--
the
sherman
act.
the
second
reason
given
in
noerr
was
that
there
is
indeed
a
--
a
strong
policy
of
government
to
encourage
the
--
the
free
flow
of
information
to
governmental
officials
towards
--
with
adopting
or
imposing
restrictive
action.
the
third
reason
given
was
that
if
the
sherman
act
were
extended
to
apply
in
--
in
--
in
these
joint
efforts,
it
would
raise
serious
questions
of
whether
the
first
amendment
right
to
petition
would
be
jeopardized.
so
the
second
reason
deserves
our
particular
attention,
namely,
the
strong
policy
of
government
to
encourage
the
free
flow
of
information
to
governmental
officers
charged
with
action,
which
may
have
a
restrictive
effect.
the
concept
is
that
in
such
an
area,
the
government
can
do
its
job
best
in
this
very
discretionary
sphere,
if
it
can
call
upon
the
information
of
members
of
the
public
who
have
an
interest.
it
is
and
as
noted
in
noerr,
it
is
those
that
a
competitive
interest
who
can
be
best
counted
on
and
certainly
are
the
most
motivating
to
furnish
the
very
kind
of
information
which
will
be
of
assistance
to
the
government.
and
i
suppose
you
to
charge
(inaudible)
that
that
should
be
true,
but
it
is
true
that
those
with
anticompetitive
motive
can
often
be
most
useful
in
assisting
the
governmental
body
to
make
its
determination.
mr.
khourie,
counsel
for
the
plaintiffs,
recognizes
that
reason
in
--
in
the
noerr
case,
but
he
says
“and
the
doctrine
should
apply
only
to
legislative
and
executive
activity
and
in
any
event
not
to
applications
for
certificates
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
for
the
general
certificating
process,
engaged
in
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
the
public
utilities
commission.”
he
goes
to
great
efforts
to
say
that
their
activities
are
judicial
in
--
in
nature
and
equates
to
the
fact
that
certainly
the
procedures
of
those
bodies
have
many,
if
the
--
the
overtones
of
proceedings
before
a
court,
the
calling
of
witnesses,
swearing
of
witnesses
and
the
receipt
of
false
evidence,
which
is
not
here
and
so
on.
then
he
turns
to
the
--
hereto
say
that
what
these
bodies
do
is
--
is
to
adjudicate
in
the
realm
of
certification,
then
herein
as
to
the
patent
cases,
which
he
relies
on
very
heavily
for
the
proposition
that
efforts
to
obtain
a
restraint
for
the
use
of
the
judicial
machinery
maybe
actionable
under
the
sherman
act.
i
submit
that
the
patent
cases
which
in
law
of
the
grant
of
an
absolute
monopoly
have
little
relevance
to
the
case
we
have
here
and
that
all
of
them
can
be
readily
explained,
if
--
if
--
to
the
extent
they
do
present
any
conflict
with
the
noerr-pennington
doctrine.
now,
i
submit
that
it
is
immaterial
whether
the
action
of
the
--
of
the
utilities
commission
or
the
interstate
commerce
commission
be
described
as
adjudication
or
adjudicatory
or
by
any
--
any
other
name.
the
pertinent
question
is
whether
the
agency
is
substantially
aiding
by
the
kind
of
information
which
competitive
interests
can
be
expected
to
produce,
if
they
are
protected
from
the
sherman
act.i
submit
that
the
answer
is
yes,
vis-à-vis,
the
icc
and
the
puc.
so
i
--
to
substantiate
that
i
--
i
point
out
what
the
certificate
regulating
function
is.senior
judge
hamlin,
the
dissenting
judge
of
the
ninth
circuit,
correctly
characterized
it
as,
“one,
i
can
to
policymaking”.
the
concept
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
connotes
a
--
a
very
broad
discretion.
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
so.
the
content
can
vary
a
great
deal
according
to
time
and
circumstances.
i
would
suggest
that
in
practical
effect,
there
is
great
difference
between
what
i
might
describe
as
the
public
good
standard,
which
a
--
a
legislature
or
a
governor
employs,
when
he
makes
a
--
when
he
takes
action
of
a
restrictive
nature
and
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
standards
which
enable
such
the
icc
or
puc
applies.
the
agency
contract
about
mr.
khourie
would
say,
does
not
adjudicate
rights.
there's
no
such
thing
as
a
right
by
carrier
a
to
a
certificate.
on
the
contrary
the
agency
is
regulating
in
the
public
interest.
and
the
grant
or
denial
of
a
certificate
is
simply
an
incident
to
that
overall
regulation
of
one
segment
of
the
public
utility
industry.
now,
with
such
understanding
of
a
certificating
function,
it
is
perhaps
no
surprise
that
protests
from
existing
carriers
are
sanctioned
and
encouraged.
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
the
public
utilities
code,
both
contained
provisions
which
indicate
an
anticipation
that
the
protest
and
participation
of
competitors
in
the
form
of
those
already
holding
certificates
shall
be
entertained.
then
very
specifically,
the
procedures
of
the
two
agencies
provide
for
the
invention
of
competitors.
that
will
be
competitors
is,
so
far
the
count
for
any
permission
goes
at
least,
required
to
or
entitled
to
receive
notice
of
the
application,
if
the
application
is
for
a
certification
in
his
area
and
such
carrier
is
entitled
to
come
in
and
protest
and
say
his
piece.
indeed,
it
is
customary
both
before
the
icc
and
the
puc
for
groups
of
carriers
to
come
in
and
protest
as
the
defendant
are
alleged
to
have
done
here.
the
only
difference
that
i
can
see
being
that
in
this
case,
their
program
was
a
considered
program
to
participate
in
all
proceedings
that
came
along
rather
than
sporadically.
this
leads
me
to
comment
on
the
concept
of
probable
cause.
the
--
the
complaint
alleges
that
protests
were
filed
in
all
cases
and
it
goes
on
from
the
say
thing
to
so
say,
“with
or
without
probable
cause
and
regardless
of
the
merits.”
i
suggest
to
your
honors,
that
the
concept
of
probable
cause
simply
has
no
place
in
a
proceeding
which
involves
the
issue
of
public
convenience
and
necessity.
it
is
not
the
adjudication
of
a
private
right.
probable
cause
is
a
concept
which
applies
for
instance
in
a
--
a
suit
on
the
contract,
involving
the
payment
of
money
in
a
--
and
most
of
the
time,
be
determined
very
quickly,
whether
the
complaint
is
frivolous
or
whether
there
is
probable
cause.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
we
must,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
yes.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
we
--
we
accept
that
allegation.
and
that
--
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
i
certainly
would.
i
consider
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
i
should
take
they
well
might
be.
the
--
the
concept
is
--
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
i
--
i
accept
the
wood
case.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
yes,
assuming
that
the
facts
are
as
they
were
found
by
--
by
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
--
in
that
case
--
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
--
then
i
accept
the
wood
case.
i
--
i
say
that
in
--
and
if
--
in
--
found
adjudicative
--
i
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
in
--
in
a
proceeding
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
or
the
public
utilities
commission
which
has
its
own
procedures
and
which
is
designed
to
get
a
fact.
the
--
the
presentation
of
--
or
false
information
should
very
welcome
come
in
a
--
in
a
different
category.
the
presentation
of
facts
which
are
relevant
and
bear
upon
that
overall
concept
of
what
is
in
the
public
interest
and
which
any
two
people
can
differ.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
there
are
19.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
no,
there's
--
to
some
extent
they
do.
they
--
they
--
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
--
they're
overlapped.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
well,
i
--
i
you
--
you
will
--
you
will
observe,
your
honor,
that
the
complaint
alleges
that
the
protests
were
filed
in
every
case
where
there
was
a
competitive
interest,
not
in
--
not
quite
to
me
in
--
in
every
case,
every
conceivable
case.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
well
--
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
i
--
i
think,
i
--
i
understand
your
question,
mr.
justice
white.
and
--
and
the
--
the
answer
lies
from
the
fact
that
what
the
commission
does
is
to
regulate
a
whole
industry
and
it
is
very
much
in
the
interest
--
it
was
very
much
in
the
interest
of
these
defendants
to
make
an
effort
to
persuade
the
commission
to
apply
a
more
restrictive
policy.
so
that
in
every
case
since
that
the
commission
does
determine
policy
on
a
case
by
case
basis,
it
means
that
every
case
that
comes
along,
does
involve
an
issue
of
the
overall
policy
of
the
extent
to
which
certification
would
be
in
the
public
interest.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
well
--
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
well,
i
--
i
think
we
--
we
have
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
--
the
--
our
position
was
only
to
the
extent
and
as
permitted
by
the
regulatory
agency
that
there's
no
allegation
of
abuse
of
the
administrative
process.
so
i
--
i
would
say
that
the
interest
of
every
carrier
who
participated
in
--
in
this
program
arises
from
the
fact
that
he
has
an
interest
in
the
overall
way
in
which
the
commission
formulates
its
continuing
policy
in
determining
the
scope
and
content
to
be
given
in
--
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
i
--
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
yes,
it
is,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
it's
not
really
altogether
the
ins
against
the
outs
because
the
(voice
overlap)
plaintiffs
as
well
or
--
or
certificate
of
carriers.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
yes,
it
is.
it
is,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
i
think
basically
it
is
what
trade
associations
do
when
they
group
together
to
produce
a
--
a
joint
result.
i
--
i
believe
that
so
long
as
the
evidence
offered
by
these
protesters
is
honest
and
relevant,
they
are
--
and
--
and
they
are
helping
the
agency
formulate
the
policy.
their
activity
should
not
be
allowed
to
fall
under
the
sherman
act.
now
--
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
well,
i
--
i
think
if
--
if
it
includes
--
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
it
--
it
includes
the
--
the
right
to
--
to
act
for
that
kind
of
motive.
yes,
provided
the
--
the
intent,
the
one
intent,
namely,
to
influence
the
governmental
body
is
--
is
genuine.
now,
in
--
in
the
noerr
case,
also
it's
a
devious
means
were
--
were
used
to
influence
the
legislature
and
the
governor.
that
kind
of
thing
would
--
would
not
be
allowed
in
an
administrative
body
such
as
the
icc
or
puc.
i
would
say
that
in
that
category,
it
has
to
be
shown
that
the
intent
was
to
be
as
effective
as
possible
with
honest
evidence
and
relevant
evidence
in
order
to
come
within
the
--
the
purview
of
the
--
the
noerr
doctrine.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
yes.
well,
you
got
back
to
parker
and
they
--
that
parker
can't
hold
of
course
that
any
--
any
action
by
--
by
the
government
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
and
--
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
no.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
that
is
quite
true.
now,
i
--
i
suggest
that
the
--
the
action
in
this
case,
any
restraint
in
this
case
is
governmentally
imposed
because
the
final
result
is
what
the
commission
does
based
upon
evidence
in
granting
or
denying
certificates.
as
to
the
value
of
the
participation
in
defendants,
the
complaint
makes
the
remarkably
revealing
allegation
that
there
were
instances
in
which
certificates
were
denied
only
because
the
defendants
and
only
because
the
defendants
were
--
were
present.
that
i
think
judge
white
had
put
his
finger
on
it,
when
he
said
that
if
you
don't
have
a
protest,
these
applications
otherwise
become
one-sided
affairs,
the
commissioners
rendered
more
or
less
helpless,
it
does
not
have
the
manpower
to
go
out
and
make
all
the
investigations
which
the
defendant
motivated
to
come
in
and
--
and
give
evidence
on.
and
unless
you
permit
them
to
come
in,
the
commission
is
--
is
in
the
very
unhappy
possession
of
having
to
give
a
certificate
based
only
on
what
they
see
in
--
in
the
application.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
no.
there's
no
allegation
of
that
kind
and
i
think
that
--
that
is
the
fatal
weakness
in
this
complaint.
the
--
the
power,
there's
no
allegation
that
the
administrative
bodies
ever
lacked
complete
power
to
control
their
processes
and
prevent
abuses
in
the
form
of
redundancy
or
excessive
protest.
there's
no
allegation
that
the
complaint
that
--
that
the
agency's
lack
the
power
to
make
determinations
on
the
merit.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
yes.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
well
--
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
i
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
that
it
--
that
it
is
correct,
unless
you
--
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
yes.
well,
they
--
the
decline
in
--
in
application
is
most
significant,
because
it
--
it
shows
that
the
agency
was
enabled
to
--
first
of
all
that
there
was
an
effect
of
discouraging
and
deterring
those
from
coming
before
the
agency
who
did
not
--
were
not
willing
to
withstand
the
--
the
test
of
--
of
making
a
--
a
presentation.
i
--
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
the
--
the
real
crux
of
the
matter
is
that
a
person
who
comes
in
and
presents
an
application
to
the
commission
should
expect
to
have
to
under
--
undergo
the
--
the
burden
of
having
to
prove
up.
now,
the
effect
of
--
of
the
program
of
the
defendant
was
to
keep
out
those
who
do
not
have
the
responsibility
or
the
sense
of
responsibility
to
be
willing
to
prove
up,
but
they
wanted
in
the
sense
was
a
free
ride.
they
wanted
to
take
advantage
of
a
situation
that
had
obtained
before
when
the
commission
had
nothing
to
go
on
except
the
application
and
therefore,
was
granting
certificates
more
or
less,
freely
and
i
--
i
think
the
--
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
it
--
it
did.
yes.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
no.
prior
to
the
time
of
the
activity
alleged
here,
there
were
virtually
no
protests.
in
fact,
i
think
that's
alleged
in
--
in
the
complaint
certainly
in
--
in
the
plaintiff's
briefing.
that
there
were
virtually
no
protest
and
that
commission
was
granting
certificates
as
they
say
under
a
legal
policy.
the
commission
does
not
have
any
liberal
policy
as
such
on
--
on
the
books.
it
--
it
--
contrary
to
what
mr.
khourie
says,
there
was
--
indeed,
there
was
a
grace
period
to
clean
up
the
bad
situation,
but
after
that,
the
--
the
policy
was
public
convenience
and
necessity.
and
during
the
period
until
the
defendants
came,
the
certificates
were
granted
as
very
freely,
not
because
of
any
liberal
policy,
but
because
of
the
absence
of
the
kind
of
--
of
counter
evidence,
which
is
very
useful
to
the
governmental
body
in
making
its
determinations
--
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
well
if
--
if
one
reads
to
the
factual
context
in
the
--
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
yes.
and
--
and
the
--
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
well,
the
--
the
allegation
is
that
the
way
in
which
that
threat
occurs
was
to
say
to
publicize
fact,
we
will
go
in
and
we
will
protect.
so
i
say
that
any
discouragement
or
deterrent
is
the
result
of
governmental
action
-
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
--
the
governmental
process.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
yes,
i
think
it
is.
because,
unless
--
unless
this
kind
of
activity
is
protected.
it
simply
means
that
the
agency
is
--
is
deprived
of
the
kind
of
information
--
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
well,
there
is
--
there
is
nothing
--
nothing
wrong
in
--
in
imposing
upon
an
applicant
a
requirement
that
he
make
out
of
his
case.
certainly,
he
has
no
--
no
right
to
--
to
receive
a
certificate
without
--
without
proving
up
his
case.
and
i
think
that
--
that
is
what
--
what
justifies
whatever
discouragement
or
--
or
deterrent
may
have
arisen
on
the
program.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
no.
it's
quite
true.
it
--
it
is
different
in
that
respect,
your
honor.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
i
--
i
didn't
understand,
your
honor.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
no,
in
the
contrary
your
honor,
that
the
factual
allegations,
mr.
--
mr.
justice
brennan
has
referred
to
conclusions
but
the
factual
allegation's
been
supported
or
simply
that
the
defendants
publicized
this
program
and
said,
“if
you
come
in,
we
shall
protest.”
now,
the
--
the
expense
can
--
can
always
be
controlled
by
the
agency
itself.
there
is
no
--
no
problem
of
--
of
an
inability
on
the
part
of
--
of
the
plaintiff
to
complain
to
the
commission
and
say
this
proceeding
is
--
is
becoming
too
burdensome.
the
evidence
is
being
repetitious
and
i'd
see
many
of
cases
where
such
an
allegation
has
been
made
and
the
--
and
the
proceeding
has
been
carefully
restricted.
now,
there
was
no
--
certainly,
no
allegation
here
that
the
defendants
or
--
or
that
the
agencies
in
question
were
rendered
powerless
to
control
any
abuses.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
well,
your
hypothetical
goes
a
little
bit
far
if
that
--
if
that
news
item
said,
“if
you
sue
us
libel,
we
will
fight
you
and
fight
you
hard
and
fight
you
all
the
way,”
then
i
would
say
that
is
perhaps
what
we
have
here.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
well,
that
--
that
is
the
allegation.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
yes.
i
--
i
figured
it's
true
to
say
that
the
--
the
allegation
is
that
the
defendants
would
protest
in
every
--
in
every
case,
but
always
with
that
--
that
caveat
that
the
protest
would
be
within
the
realms
of
the
administrative
processes
and
would
not
transgress
those
protests
and
that
the
protest
would
be
for
the
purpose
of
offering
honest
evidence
and
--
and
never
falsify.
and
i
say
that
caveat
is
--
is
there
because
there's
no
--
no
allegation
in
the
complaint
to
the
contrary.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
--
the
issue
in
this
proceeding
is
whether
the
--
the
facts
in
a
treble
damage
antitrust
complaint,
constitute
a
violation
on
--
under
the
sherman
act.
in
this
case,
a
--
a
group
of
15
certificated
motor
carriers
brought
the
complaint
against
a
group
of
19
motor
carriers,
certificated
motor
carriers,
alleging
that
the
defendant
had
violated
the
sherman
act.
the
complaint
was
amended
and
the
first
amended
complaint
is
one
with
which
we
are
concerned.
i
--
i
shall
refer
to
it
simply
as
the
complaint.
we
move
to
dismiss
it
on
the
ground
that
it
fails
to
state
a
cause
of
action
under
the
sherman
act.
judge
sweigert
of
the
federal
district
court
agreed
with
our
position
and
wrote
a
really
extensive
opinion.
in
support
of
his
views,
he
gave
the
plaintiff
an
opportunity
to
amend
and
they
did
not
avail
themselves
about
and
instead
appealed
to
the
ninth
circuit.
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
by
a
2-to-1
vote.
the
dissenting
judge,
senior
judge
hamlin,
wrote
a
separate
dissenting
opinion.
we
then
petitioned
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
this
court.
now,
i
turn
to
the
complaint
and
we'll
summarize
the
--
the
fact
which
it
alleges.
that
alleges
that
these
defending
carriers
got
together
in
early
1961
and
agreed
on
a
program
of
protesting
all
certificate
proceedings
which
might
result
in
competition
to
the
defendant.
all
certificate
proceedings
brought
before
either
the
interstate
commerce
commission
or
the
california
public
utilities
commission.
the
program
was
to
include
court
review
in
the
event
the
protest
before
the
administrative
body
should
prove
unsuccessful.
the
allegation
is
that
the
defendants
agreed
to
finance
a
program
jointly,
under
an
arrangement
under
which
each
carrier
would
contribute
monthly,
a
sum
based
on
his
gross
annual
revenues,
rather
than
according
to
his
interest
or
participation
in
any
given
case.
the
agreement
was
that
the
program
should
be
publicized
to
the
carrier
industry.
the
complaint
goes
on
to
allege
that
the
agreement
was
carried
out
and
has
been
carried
out
consistently
since
1961.
as
to
purpose,
the
allegation
is
that
the
agreement
and
program
were
designed
to
reduce
or
eliminate
competition
and
that
to
achieve
that
--
that
anticompetitive
result,
the
complaint
alleges
if
we
accept
plaintiff's
version,
which
i
think
we
must,
for
purposes
of
this
case,
that
in
defendant's
primary
intent
was
to
use
the
words
of
the
complaint,
to
discourage
and
deter
the
plaintiff
and
others
in
like
position
from
filing
certificate
applications
or
from
pursuing
those
applications,
was
they
did
file.
in
this
connection,
the
--
the
plaintiff
say
that
defendants
--
that
the
defending
carriers
intended
to
make
as
effective,
a
presentation
in
each
case
before
the
relevant
commission
as
possible.
in
fact
they
recognized
that
such
an
intent
was
essential
to
the
primary
purpose
of
giving
authority
to
the
desire
to
discourage
or
deter
plaintiffs
and
others
in
the
like
position
from
coming
before
the
commission.
there's
no
--
there's
no
suggestion
in
the
complaint
that
the
defendants
were,
at
anytime,
guilty
of
dishonesty
or
deception.
there
is
no
suggestion
in
the
complaint
that
the
defendant
at
anytime
offers
false
or
irrelevant
testimony.
i
would
like
to
turn
now
to
the
reasons
why
we
believe
the
sherman
act
should
--
should
not
be
extended
to
the
fact
that's
alleged.
the
two
cases
on
which
we
chiefly
rely
are
eastern
railroad
conference
versus
noerr,
decided
in
1961
by
this
court.
it
--
it
was
a
unanimous
decision
and
justice
black
wrote
the
decision.
the
other
case
since
united
mine
workers
versus
pennington,
decided
four
years
later
in
1965.
mr.
justice
white
wrote
the
opinion
for
the
majority
in
that
case.
we
start
with
a
proposition
in
noerr
that
a
restraint
imposed
by
government
is
immune
from
the
antitrust
act.
that
has
been
held
in
parker
versus
brown
and
u.s.
versus
royal
rock.
it
would
seem
to
follow
that
--
reason
to
believe
that
the
efforts
to
influence
government
to
impose
such
governmental
restraint
should
also
be
immune
from
the
sherman
act.
i
think
that
is
at
least
in
broad
terms,
the
--
the
holding
in
--
in
noerr
and
in
pennington.
the
joint
efforts
involved
in
noerr
were
efforts
to
influence
at
least
one
state
governor
and
more
than
one
state
legislature
and
also
certain
law
enforcement
agencies.
the
joint
effort
in
pennington
involved
joint
efforts
to
influence
the
secretary
of
labor
and
officials
of
the
tennessee
valley
authority.
now,
the
noerr
case
sets
for
three
reasons
for
holding
that
the
sherman
act
should
not
apply
to
these
joint
efforts.
the
first
reason
was
essential
dissimilarity.
in
other
words
that
appeals
to
governmental
bodies
are
essentially
dissimilar
from
a
kind
of
--
of
trade
restraint
which
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
enacted
the
--
the
sherman
act.
the
second
reason
given
in
noerr
was
that
there
is
indeed
a
--
a
strong
policy
of
government
to
encourage
the
--
the
free
flow
of
information
to
governmental
officials
towards
--
with
adopting
or
imposing
restrictive
action.
the
third
reason
given
was
that
if
the
sherman
act
were
extended
to
apply
in
--
in
--
in
these
joint
efforts,
it
would
raise
serious
questions
of
whether
the
first
amendment
right
to
petition
would
be
jeopardized.
so
the
second
reason
deserves
our
particular
attention,
namely,
the
strong
policy
of
government
to
encourage
the
free
flow
of
information
to
governmental
officers
charged
with
action,
which
may
have
a
restrictive
effect.
the
concept
is
that
in
such
an
area,
the
government
can
do
its
job
best
in
this
very
discretionary
sphere,
if
it
can
call
upon
the
information
of
members
of
the
public
who
have
an
interest.
it
is
and
as
noted
in
noerr,
it
is
those
that
a
competitive
interest
who
can
be
best
counted
on
and
certainly
are
the
most
motivating
to
furnish
the
very
kind
of
information
which
will
be
of
assistance
to
the
government.
and
i
suppose
you
to
charge
(inaudible)
that
that
should
be
true,
but
it
is
true
that
those
with
anticompetitive
motive
can
often
be
most
useful
in
assisting
the
governmental
body
to
make
its
determination.
mr.
khourie,
counsel
for
the
plaintiffs,
recognizes
that
reason
in
--
in
the
noerr
case,
but
he
says
“and
the
doctrine
should
apply
only
to
legislative
and
executive
activity
and
in
any
event
not
to
applications
for
certificates
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
for
the
general
certificating
process,
engaged
in
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
the
public
utilities
commission.”
he
goes
to
great
efforts
to
say
that
their
activities
are
judicial
in
--
in
nature
and
equates
to
the
fact
that
certainly
the
procedures
of
those
bodies
have
many,
if
the
--
the
overtones
of
proceedings
before
a
court,
the
calling
of
witnesses,
swearing
of
witnesses
and
the
receipt
of
false
evidence,
which
is
not
here
and
so
on.
then
he
turns
to
the
--
hereto
say
that
what
these
bodies
do
is
--
is
to
adjudicate
in
the
realm
of
certification,
then
herein
as
to
the
patent
cases,
which
he
relies
on
very
heavily
for
the
proposition
that
efforts
to
obtain
a
restraint
for
the
use
of
the
judicial
machinery
maybe
actionable
under
the
sherman
act.
i
submit
that
the
patent
cases
which
in
law
of
the
grant
of
an
absolute
monopoly
have
little
relevance
to
the
case
we
have
here
and
that
all
of
them
can
be
readily
explained,
if
--
if
--
to
the
extent
they
do
present
any
conflict
with
the
noerr-pennington
doctrine.
now,
i
submit
that
it
is
immaterial
whether
the
action
of
the
--
of
the
utilities
commission
or
the
interstate
commerce
commission
be
described
as
adjudication
or
adjudicatory
or
by
any
--
any
other
name.
the
pertinent
question
is
whether
the
agency
is
substantially
aiding
by
the
kind
of
information
which
competitive
interests
can
be
expected
to
produce,
if
they
are
protected
from
the
sherman
act.i
submit
that
the
answer
is
yes,
vis-à-vis,
the
icc
and
the
puc.
so
i
--
to
substantiate
that
i
--
i
point
out
what
the
certificate
regulating
function
is.senior
judge
hamlin,
the
dissenting
judge
of
the
ninth
circuit,
correctly
characterized
it
as,
“one,
i
can
to
policymaking”.
the
concept
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
connotes
a
--
a
very
broad
discretion.
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
so.
the
content
can
vary
a
great
deal
according
to
time
and
circumstances.
i
would
suggest
that
in
practical
effect,
there
is
great
difference
between
what
i
might
describe
as
the
public
good
standard,
which
a
--
a
legislature
or
a
governor
employs,
when
he
makes
a
--
when
he
takes
action
of
a
restrictive
nature
and
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
standards
which
enable
such
the
icc
or
puc
applies.
the
agency
contract
about
mr.
khourie
would
say,
does
not
adjudicate
rights.
there's
no
such
thing
as
a
right
by
carrier
a
to
a
certificate.
on
the
contrary
the
agency
is
regulating
in
the
public
interest.
and
the
grant
or
denial
of
a
certificate
is
simply
an
incident
to
that
overall
regulation
of
one
segment
of
the
public
utility
industry.
now,
with
such
understanding
of
a
certificating
function,
it
is
perhaps
no
surprise
that
protests
from
existing
carriers
are
sanctioned
and
encouraged.
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
the
public
utilities
code,
both
contained
provisions
which
indicate
an
anticipation
that
the
protest
and
participation
of
competitors
in
the
form
of
those
already
holding
certificates
shall
be
entertained.
then
very
specifically,
the
procedures
of
the
two
agencies
provide
for
the
invention
of
competitors.
that
will
be
competitors
is,
so
far
the
count
for
any
permission
goes
at
least,
required
to
or
entitled
to
receive
notice
of
the
application,
if
the
application
is
for
a
certification
in
his
area
and
such
carrier
is
entitled
to
come
in
and
protest
and
say
his
piece.
indeed,
it
is
customary
both
before
the
icc
and
the
puc
for
groups
of
carriers
to
come
in
and
protest
as
the
defendant
are
alleged
to
have
done
here.
the
only
difference
that
i
can
see
being
that
in
this
case,
their
program
was
a
considered
program
to
participate
in
all
proceedings
that
came
along
rather
than
sporadically.
this
leads
me
to
comment
on
the
concept
of
probable
cause.
the
--
the
complaint
alleges
that
protests
were
filed
in
all
cases
and
it
goes
on
from
the
say
thing
to
so
say,
“with
or
without
probable
cause
and
regardless
of
the
merits.”
i
suggest
to
your
honors,
that
the
concept
of
probable
cause
simply
has
no
place
in
a
proceeding
which
involves
the
issue
of
public
convenience
and
necessity.
it
is
not
the
adjudication
of
a
private
right.
probable
cause
is
a
concept
which
applies
for
instance
in
a
--
a
suit
on
the
contract,
involving
the
payment
of
money
in
a
--
and
most
of
the
time,
be
determined
very
quickly,
whether
the
complaint
is
frivolous
or
whether
there
is
probable
cause.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
we
must,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
yes.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
we
--
we
accept
that
allegation.
and
that
--
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
i
certainly
would.
i
consider
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
i
should
take
they
well
might
be.
the
--
the
concept
is
--
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
i
--
i
accept
the
wood
case.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
yes,
assuming
that
the
facts
are
as
they
were
found
by
--
by
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
--
in
that
case
--
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
--
then
i
accept
the
wood
case.
i
--
i
say
that
in
--
and
if
--
in
--
found
adjudicative
--
i
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
in
--
in
a
proceeding
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
or
the
public
utilities
commission
which
has
its
own
procedures
and
which
is
designed
to
get
a
fact.
the
--
the
presentation
of
--
or
false
information
should
very
welcome
come
in
a
--
in
a
different
category.
the
presentation
of
facts
which
are
relevant
and
bear
upon
that
overall
concept
of
what
is
in
the
public
interest
and
which
any
two
people
can
differ.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
there
are
19.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
no,
there's
--
to
some
extent
they
do.
they
--
they
--
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
--
they're
overlapped.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
well,
i
--
i
you
--
you
will
--
you
will
observe,
your
honor,
that
the
complaint
alleges
that
the
protests
were
filed
in
every
case
where
there
was
a
competitive
interest,
not
in
--
not
quite
to
me
in
--
in
every
case,
every
conceivable
case.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
well
--
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
i
--
i
think,
i
--
i
understand
your
question,
mr.
justice
white.
and
--
and
the
--
the
answer
lies
from
the
fact
that
what
the
commission
does
is
to
regulate
a
whole
industry
and
it
is
very
much
in
the
interest
--
it
was
very
much
in
the
interest
of
these
defendants
to
make
an
effort
to
persuade
the
commission
to
apply
a
more
restrictive
policy.
so
that
in
every
case
since
that
the
commission
does
determine
policy
on
a
case
by
case
basis,
it
means
that
every
case
that
comes
along,
does
involve
an
issue
of
the
overall
policy
of
the
extent
to
which
certification
would
be
in
the
public
interest.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
well
--
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
well,
i
--
i
think
we
--
we
have
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
--
the
--
our
position
was
only
to
the
extent
and
as
permitted
by
the
regulatory
agency
that
there's
no
allegation
of
abuse
of
the
administrative
process.
so
i
--
i
would
say
that
the
interest
of
every
carrier
who
participated
in
--
in
this
program
arises
from
the
fact
that
he
has
an
interest
in
the
overall
way
in
which
the
commission
formulates
its
continuing
policy
in
determining
the
scope
and
content
to
be
given
in
--
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
i
--
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
yes,
it
is,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
it's
not
really
altogether
the
ins
against
the
outs
because
the
(voice
overlap)
plaintiffs
as
well
or
--
or
certificate
of
carriers.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
yes,
it
is.
it
is,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
i
think
basically
it
is
what
trade
associations
do
when
they
group
together
to
produce
a
--
a
joint
result.
i
--
i
believe
that
so
long
as
the
evidence
offered
by
these
protesters
is
honest
and
relevant,
they
are
--
and
--
and
they
are
helping
the
agency
formulate
the
policy.
their
activity
should
not
be
allowed
to
fall
under
the
sherman
act.
now
--
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
well,
i
--
i
think
if
--
if
it
includes
--
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
it
--
it
includes
the
--
the
right
to
--
to
act
for
that
kind
of
motive.
yes,
provided
the
--
the
intent,
the
one
intent,
namely,
to
influence
the
governmental
body
is
--
is
genuine.
now,
in
--
in
the
noerr
case,
also
it's
a
devious
means
were
--
were
used
to
influence
the
legislature
and
the
governor.
that
kind
of
thing
would
--
would
not
be
allowed
in
an
administrative
body
such
as
the
icc
or
puc.
i
would
say
that
in
that
category,
it
has
to
be
shown
that
the
intent
was
to
be
as
effective
as
possible
with
honest
evidence
and
relevant
evidence
in
order
to
come
within
the
--
the
purview
of
the
--
the
noerr
doctrine.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
yes.
well,
you
got
back
to
parker
and
they
--
that
parker
can't
hold
of
course
that
any
--
any
action
by
--
by
the
government
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
and
--
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
no.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
that
is
quite
true.
now,
i
--
i
suggest
that
the
--
the
action
in
this
case,
any
restraint
in
this
case
is
governmentally
imposed
because
the
final
result
is
what
the
commission
does
based
upon
evidence
in
granting
or
denying
certificates.
as
to
the
value
of
the
participation
in
defendants,
the
complaint
makes
the
remarkably
revealing
allegation
that
there
were
instances
in
which
certificates
were
denied
only
because
the
defendants
and
only
because
the
defendants
were
--
were
present.
that
i
think
judge
white
had
put
his
finger
on
it,
when
he
said
that
if
you
don't
have
a
protest,
these
applications
otherwise
become
one-sided
affairs,
the
commissioners
rendered
more
or
less
helpless,
it
does
not
have
the
manpower
to
go
out
and
make
all
the
investigations
which
the
defendant
motivated
to
come
in
and
--
and
give
evidence
on.
and
unless
you
permit
them
to
come
in,
the
commission
is
--
is
in
the
very
unhappy
possession
of
having
to
give
a
certificate
based
only
on
what
they
see
in
--
in
the
application.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
no.
there's
no
allegation
of
that
kind
and
i
think
that
--
that
is
the
fatal
weakness
in
this
complaint.
the
--
the
power,
there's
no
allegation
that
the
administrative
bodies
ever
lacked
complete
power
to
control
their
processes
and
prevent
abuses
in
the
form
of
redundancy
or
excessive
protest.
there's
no
allegation
that
the
complaint
that
--
that
the
agency's
lack
the
power
to
make
determinations
on
the
merit.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
yes.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
well
--
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
i
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
that
it
--
that
it
is
correct,
unless
you
--
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
yes.
well,
they
--
the
decline
in
--
in
application
is
most
significant,
because
it
--
it
shows
that
the
agency
was
enabled
to
--
first
of
all
that
there
was
an
effect
of
discouraging
and
deterring
those
from
coming
before
the
agency
who
did
not
--
were
not
willing
to
withstand
the
--
the
test
of
--
of
making
a
--
a
presentation.
i
--
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
the
--
the
real
crux
of
the
matter
is
that
a
person
who
comes
in
and
presents
an
application
to
the
commission
should
expect
to
have
to
under
--
undergo
the
--
the
burden
of
having
to
prove
up.
now,
the
effect
of
--
of
the
program
of
the
defendant
was
to
keep
out
those
who
do
not
have
the
responsibility
or
the
sense
of
responsibility
to
be
willing
to
prove
up,
but
they
wanted
in
the
sense
was
a
free
ride.
they
wanted
to
take
advantage
of
a
situation
that
had
obtained
before
when
the
commission
had
nothing
to
go
on
except
the
application
and
therefore,
was
granting
certificates
more
or
less,
freely
and
i
--
i
think
the
--
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
it
--
it
did.
yes.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
no.
prior
to
the
time
of
the
activity
alleged
here,
there
were
virtually
no
protests.
in
fact,
i
think
that's
alleged
in
--
in
the
complaint
certainly
in
--
in
the
plaintiff's
briefing.
that
there
were
virtually
no
protest
and
that
commission
was
granting
certificates
as
they
say
under
a
legal
policy.
the
commission
does
not
have
any
liberal
policy
as
such
on
--
on
the
books.
it
--
it
--
contrary
to
what
mr.
khourie
says,
there
was
--
indeed,
there
was
a
grace
period
to
clean
up
the
bad
situation,
but
after
that,
the
--
the
policy
was
public
convenience
and
necessity.
and
during
the
period
until
the
defendants
came,
the
certificates
were
granted
as
very
freely,
not
because
of
any
liberal
policy,
but
because
of
the
absence
of
the
kind
of
--
of
counter
evidence,
which
is
very
useful
to
the
governmental
body
in
making
its
determinations
--
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
well
if
--
if
one
reads
to
the
factual
context
in
the
--
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
yes.
and
--
and
the
--
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
well,
the
--
the
allegation
is
that
the
way
in
which
that
threat
occurs
was
to
say
to
publicize
fact,
we
will
go
in
and
we
will
protect.
so
i
say
that
any
discouragement
or
deterrent
is
the
result
of
governmental
action
-
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
--
the
governmental
process.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
yes,
i
think
it
is.
because,
unless
--
unless
this
kind
of
activity
is
protected.
it
simply
means
that
the
agency
is
--
is
deprived
of
the
kind
of
information
--
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
well,
there
is
--
there
is
nothing
--
nothing
wrong
in
--
in
imposing
upon
an
applicant
a
requirement
that
he
make
out
of
his
case.
certainly,
he
has
no
--
no
right
to
--
to
receive
a
certificate
without
--
without
proving
up
his
case.
and
i
think
that
--
that
is
what
--
what
justifies
whatever
discouragement
or
--
or
deterrent
may
have
arisen
on
the
program.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
no.
it's
quite
true.
it
--
it
is
different
in
that
respect,
your
honor.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
i
--
i
didn't
understand,
your
honor.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
no,
in
the
contrary
your
honor,
that
the
factual
allegations,
mr.
--
mr.
justice
brennan
has
referred
to
conclusions
but
the
factual
allegation's
been
supported
or
simply
that
the
defendants
publicized
this
program
and
said,
“if
you
come
in,
we
shall
protest.”
now,
the
--
the
expense
can
--
can
always
be
controlled
by
the
agency
itself.
there
is
no
--
no
problem
of
--
of
an
inability
on
the
part
of
--
of
the
plaintiff
to
complain
to
the
commission
and
say
this
proceeding
is
--
is
becoming
too
burdensome.
the
evidence
is
being
repetitious
and
i'd
see
many
of
cases
where
such
an
allegation
has
been
made
and
the
--
and
the
proceeding
has
been
carefully
restricted.
now,
there
was
no
--
certainly,
no
allegation
here
that
the
defendants
or
--
or
that
the
agencies
in
question
were
rendered
powerless
to
control
any
abuses.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
well,
your
hypothetical
goes
a
little
bit
far
if
that
--
if
that
news
item
said,
“if
you
sue
us
libel,
we
will
fight
you
and
fight
you
hard
and
fight
you
all
the
way,”
then
i
would
say
that
is
perhaps
what
we
have
here.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
well,
that
--
that
is
the
allegation.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
yes.
i
--
i
figured
it's
true
to
say
that
the
--
the
allegation
is
that
the
defendants
would
protest
in
every
--
in
every
case,
but
always
with
that
--
that
caveat
that
the
protest
would
be
within
the
realms
of
the
administrative
processes
and
would
not
transgress
those
protests
and
that
the
protest
would
be
for
the
purpose
of
offering
honest
evidence
and
--
and
never
falsify.
and
i
say
that
caveat
is
--
is
there
because
there's
no
--
no
allegation
in
the
complaint
to
the
contrary.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
thank
you,
your
honor.
