have
you
any
plans
underway
for
doing
that?
unknown
speaker
i
was
going
to
ask
you
is
mr.
blumstein
attacking
the
30-day
provision
also
as
well
as
the
three-month
provision
here?
unknown
speaker
he
can
not
very
well
attack
it
because
he
brought
his
suit
within
the
30
days
of
his,
assuming
his
residency.
unknown
speaker
at
this
point,
what
are
you
asking
us
to
do
with
pope
against
williams?
unknown
speaker
if
we
are
going
to
overrule
it
anyway?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
i
am
asking
you
is
that
do
you
want
us
to
distinguish
it
or
to
overrule
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
always
are
there
are
never
two
cases
as
alike
that
i
wanted
to
pin
down
your
approach
on
pope
v.
williams,
whether
you
thought
it
could
stand,
be
distinguished
because
of
the
popularity
of
different
approaches
in
the
past
or
whether
it
should
go
and
to
discard,
and
i
take
it,
it
is
the
latter
that
you
are
asking
us
to
do.
unknown
speaker
now
you
have
used
both
terms,
domicile
and
residence,
are
you
drawing
any
technical
distinctions
between
the
two?
unknown
