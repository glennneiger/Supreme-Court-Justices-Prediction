we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
dunn
against
blumstein.
mr.
roberts
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief

e.

mr.
roberts,
have
there
been
any
studies
made
on
a
widespread
or
even
a
national
basis
to
determine
how
long
it
takes
to
pack
up
registration
and
that
sort
of
thing
to
check
out
to
be
sure
that
the
voters
are
voting
in
two
states.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
tennessee
have
criminal
penalties
for
voting
in
tennessee
and
voting
somewhere
else
if
it
could
be
accomplished?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
roberts.
mr.
blumstein?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
on
your
theory,
a
man
can
move
into
tennessee
in
the
morning,
get
off
the
plane,
go
and
buy
a
house
that
afternoon
which
he
might
readily
do,
present
himself
in
the
afternoon
at
5
o’clock
in
the
polling
booth
and
insist
on
voting.
is
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
tennessee
could,
by
its
constitution,
fix
voting
age
at
the
age
25
for
everyone
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
federal
constitution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
except
for
national
elections?
i
am
talking
about
local
elections.
could
tennessee
fix
the
voting
age
at
the
age
25?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
was
just
asking
your
response
on
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
state
and
local
elections?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
inspired
of
the
twenty
sixth
amendment,
could
it
be
that
tennessee
have
made
that
choice?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
the
penalty
that
is
surprising.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
what
you
are
challenging
is
the
right
of
tennessee
to
say
that
they
want
people
who
are
politically
mature
in
relationship
to
the
issues
and
the
candidates,
is
that
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
true
on
bond
issues
for
example?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
constitutional
amendments
and
things
of
that
kind?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
suppose
we
could
take
traditional
notice
that
money
is
not
spent
that
way
generally
speaking
on
bond
issue
problems
that
are
submitted
to
the
voters.
would
you
agree
with
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
were
placing
a
great
deal
of
weight
on
someone
making
a
survey
that
most
of
the
money
that
a
candidate
spends
is
spent
in
the
last
30
days
on
television,
and
i
was
simply
asking
you
whether
the
same
thing
is
true
with
respect
to
bond
issue
which
is
being
submitted
to
the
voters.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
blumstein.
mr.

i
think
we
will
not
ask
you
to

your
rebuttal.

mr.
