justice
potter
stewart
and,
that
is
because,
mr.
roberts,
under
existing
tennessee
law,
you
can
move
into
another
county
and
still
vote
in
the
old
county,
is
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
then,
you
would
have
to
vote
in
the
new
county.
justice
potter
stewart
if
a
man
move
from
shelby
county
to
jackson
county
of
tennessee,
say,
he
could
continue
to
vote
in
shelby
county
so
long
as
he
have
not
reregistered
in
jackson
county
for
a
period
of
at
least
of
90
days?
justice
potter
stewart
to
the
volatile
--
justice
potter
stewart
and,
this
is
at
existing
tennessee
law
long
before
this
court
decision.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then,
you
also
said
that
a
man
can
move
away
from
the
state
of
tennessee
and
continue
to
vote
in
tennessee.
for
how
long?
justice
potter
stewart
and
becomes
eligible
to
vote
by
registering
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
your
are
not
talking
simply
about
absentee
ballots,
are
you?
justice
potter
stewart
all
right
justice
potter
stewart
or
the
man
can
move,
we
would
say,
the
company
sends
into
missouri.
he
does
not
know
how
long
he
had
been
staying
there
so
he
is
living
in
an
apartment
or
a
motel
and
doest
not
plan
to
make
that
his
home.
he
can
continue
to
vote
in
tennessee
even
though
he
is
physically
out
of
the
state
and
has
been
for
a
period
of
weeks
or
months.
justice
potter
stewart
yeah,
because
that
is
--
that
is
different
though
from
what
you
told
me
about
changing
your
home
from
pickett
county
to
nashville.
if
you
changed
your
home,
you
could
vote
in
pickett
county
only
until
you
would
register
in
nashville.
is
that
not
right?
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
did
not
consider
pickett
county
your
home.
if
you
had
moved
--
moved
your
domicile
from
picket
county
to
--
what
is
the
county’s
name?
justice
potter
stewart
davidson
county.
you
could
continue
to
vote
in
pickett
county
for
90
days
until
you
became
eligible
and
registered
to
vote
in
davidson
county,
even
though
you
had
moved,
which
you
tell
us
you
have
not.
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
the
state
said
that
you
had
to
be
a
resident
of
the
state
for
30
years
and
a
resident
of
the
county
for
15
years
for
you
are
eligible
to
vote.
do
you
not
think
that
might
be
the
business
of
the
court
than
somebody
with
constitutional
adjudication.
justice
potter
stewart
obviously
to
justify
a
long,
long
period
like
that,
it
could
just
say
that
we
only
want
old-timers
around
here
to
vote.
justice
potter
stewart
was
tennessee
itself
had
decided
that
30
days
is
sufficient
for
registration
purposes,
had
it
not,
by
through
its
own
legislature?
justice
potter
stewart
but
by
the
same
token
i
gather
mr.
blumstein,
you
are
not
asserting
that
a
state
is
constitutionally
required
to
let
every
single
resident,
who
is
qualified
by
age,
vote,
are
you,
because
a
person
can
become
a
resident
under
the
law
in
less
than
24
hours,
be
in
the
state
with
no
intention
to
live
elsewhere
and
that
can
happen
in
a
matter
of
hours.
and,
are
you
contending
that
the
constitution
requires
the
state
to
permit
every
resident
of
tennessee
who
is
18
years
old
or
over
and
otherwise
qualified
to
vote.
justice
potter
stewart
there
is,
but,
i
am
asking
you
if
you
--
there
is,
as
a
matter
of
state
statute.
i
am
asking
about
what
your
constitutional
claim
is.
justice
potter
stewart
i
did
not
ask
the
kind
of
review
it
triggered,
i
asked
you
whether
your
claim
is
that
the
state
is
compelled
to
commit
every
bona
fide
resident
of
tennessee
who
is
over
18
years
old
to
vote.
and,
i
point
out
that
as
a
matter
of
law
while
apart
from
these
evidentiary
indicia
having
to
do
with
driver’s
licenses
and
taxes
and
so
on,
as
a
matter,
well-established
law,
a
person
can
become
a
resident
of
the
state
--
a
new
resident
of
a
state
in
a
matter
of
minutes.
justice
potter
stewart
you
are
not
complaining
that
30-day
period
is
constitutionally
invalid?
justice
potter
stewart
does
tennessee
has
a
permanent
registration
or
does
a
person
have
to
register
for
each
election
or
does
he
have
to
register
only
if
he
misses
a
couple
of
elections?
justice
potter
stewart
certain
number
consecutively.
justice
potter
stewart
i
do
not
see
how
you
can
say
that
30-day
provision
applies
equally
to
long
time
residents
and
new
residents.
it
is
a
matter
of
degree
but
certainly,
it
discriminates
against
people
who
have
been
residents
of
the
state
only
29
days
or
anything
less
than
that.
justice
potter
stewart
then
all
person
who
has
been
in
the
state
29-and-a-half
days
or
less
may
attempt
because
he
wants
to
register
but
he
cannot.
so,
it
does
discriminate
against
him,
doest
it
not,
the
new
resident?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
it
is
a
matter
of
degree
as
the
question
of
my
brother
white
implies.
justice
potter
stewart
and,
that
is
because,
mr.
roberts,
under

if
a

say,
he
could

so

you
also
said
that
a

of
tennessee
and
continue
to

in
tennessee.
for
how
long?
justice
potter
stewart
and
becomes

or
--
justice
potter
stewart
your
are

are

justice

all
