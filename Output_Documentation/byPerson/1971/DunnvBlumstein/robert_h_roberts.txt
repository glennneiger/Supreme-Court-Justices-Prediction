mr.
robert
h.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
three-judge
district
court
of
the
middle
district
of
tennessee
and
i
suppose
to
struck
down
the
durational
residency
requirements
for
voting
as
provided
by
the
state
constitution
and
implemented
by
statues
of
the
legislature.
the
time
fixed
in
tennessee
for
durational
residency
requirements
was
one
year
in
the
state
and
three
months
in
the
county
for
the
person
offers
himself
to
vote.
the
question
presented
is
whether
or
not
such
constitutional
and
statutory
provisions
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
and
whether
or
not
in
determining
this,
the
doctrine
of
irrational
or
unreasonable
or
the
compelling
state
interest
doctrine
is
to
be
made
applicable
in
this
kind
of
a
case
in
part
of
determination
of
this
case.
at
the
time,
this
case
was
decided
by
the
district
court
and
so
far
as
this
counsel
has
any
way
of
ascertaining
now,
33
states
and
three
territories
had
the
durational
residence
requirements
of
at
least
the
one
year
as
the
case
in
tennessee;
15
states
had
a
six-month
residency
requirement
which
is
double
to
the
county
residence
requirement
provided
for
in
the
state
of
tennessee.
the
remaining
two
states
had
respectfully
190
days
and
the
other
three
months
the
residency
requirement.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
no
sir,
not
to
my
knowledge,
if
your
honor
please,
that
is
where
we
think
that
the
district
court
erred
in
trying
to
make
such
a
determination
based
on
the
registration
cutoff
deadline
of
30
days,
which
implies
in
tennessee
and
in
most
of
the
states
that
have
registration
laws,
but,
it
is
our
insistence
that
the
court
was
in
error
there
because
that
cutoff
period
is
designed
specifically
and
it
is
very
clearly
shown
in
the
law
to
be
for
the
purpose
of
permitting
the
county
election
officials,
the
necessary
time
to
make
the
administrative
acts
that
they
are
required
to
do.
for
example,
they
have
to
take
your
master
registration
list
and
break
that
down
precinct
by
precinct
and
make
duplicates
of
it
throughout
to
the
precinct.
they
got
to
run
their
advertisements
and
the
paper
notices
of
the
election,
select
all
of
the
judges
and
officers
to
hold
the
election
at
the
precinct
level
and
it
is
countless
number
of
things.
no
word
during
that
period
of
time
can
be
election
commission
in
tennessee
and
i
think
it
is
generally
true
at
everywhere
else
use
that
period
of
time
to
purge
an
ineligible
voter.
therefore
the
durational
residency
requirement
is
necessary,
we
feel,
in
order
to
give
some
time
for
which
the
election
commission
can
get
rid
of
any
ineligible
voters,
purge
them
as
the
case
might
be,
and
then,
the
30-day
registration
cutoff
only
for
administrative
period
and
things
alone,
because
somewhere
there
has
got
to
be
a
period
of
time
when
the
voter
knows
that
he
is
going
to
be
entitled
to
go
to
the
booth
and
vote
and
that
is
what
we
think
the
30
days
is
for.
now,
as
far
as
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
of
course
--
we
of
course
we
have
not
had
a
presidential
election
since
then.
we
do
not
yet
how
it
is
going
to
work
out.
i
do
not
think
that
there
would
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
sir?
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir.
30-day
registration
cutoff.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir.
well,
tennessee,
if
your
honor
please,
already
had
done
this
before
the
1970
voting
rights
act
was
passed.
that
is
one
of
the
things
that
i
wanted
to
point
out
to
court.
there
are
other
ways
of
doing
it
besides
in
effect
reinterpreting
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
order
to
bring
it
about.
in
tennessee,
anybody
that
moves
within
a
precinct
or
anywhere
else
in
the
state
has
90
days
in
which
to
qualify
himself
in
the
new
area
or
until
that
period
of
time,
he
can
go
back
and
vote
where
he
had
always
voted
either
in
person
or
by
absentee
ballot.
he
is
never
disfranchised.
the
same
is
true
so
far
as
the
year
and
the
state
is
concerned
by
act
--
legislature
even
before
the
1970
voting
rights.
we
provided
that
in
tennessee
any
person
who
live
in
that
state
would
maintain
his
domicile,
which
in
tennessee
is
the
same
as
legal
residence,
he
would
maintain
that
domicile
until
such
time
as
he
acquired
a
new
one
and
no
matter
what
state
he
went
to.
and,
we
think
that
that
is
an
essential
way
of
doing
it,
so
that
you
are
protecting
the
people
that
usually
would
have
the
most
standards.
it
takes
some
little
time.
i
think
the
court
can
take
a
notice
of
the
fact
that
a
person
who
has
lived
a
number
of
years
in
a
county
and
then
he
moves,
it
is
a
little
while
that
he
would
prefer
to
be
identified
back
where
he
had
been
for
any
period
of
time
as
opposed
to
immediately
entering
into
the
political
arena
in
a
new
place.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir,
we
do.
the
problem
with
this
though
if
you
go
to
confine
it
through
registration
deadline,
for
example,
as
it
is
determining,
whether
or
not
the
person
really
is
a
bona
fide
resident
of
the
state.
now,
the
district
court
in
striking
down
a
year
and
the
state
and
the
three
months
in
the
county,
did
indicate
that
they
felt
that
the
30-day
registration
deadline
was
sufficient
to
accomplish
this,
and
it
then
argued
in
opposing
counsel’s
brief
that
anybody
that
would
go
into
the
registrar’s
office
and
be
willing
to
make
an
oath
that
he
is
a
bona
fide
resident
would
also
be
willing
to
make
an
oath
and
swear
a
lie
about
anything
else
that
would
be
necessary
to
do
this.
but,
that
does
not
follow
because
it
is
nebulas
sort
of
thing.
the
matter
of
whether
a
person
is
a
bona
fide
resident
is
almost
decided
on
the
matter
of
intent.
now,
you
can
very
well
leave
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir,
that
is
true
if
this
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
and
this
court
upholds
the
lower
court’s
decision
that
that
would
be
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir.
they
are
already
raged
them,
you
see,
under
this
three-judged
court
ordered
down
there
act
of
the
30
days,
if
they
have
been
there
over
thirty
days
and
have
satisfied
the
requirements
of
being
a
bona
fide
resident.
now
so
there
--
we
have
already
had
an
election
in
other
words
since
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
since
this
was
changed,
yes
sir.
the
november
general
election
the
last
year.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
no
sir.
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
how
many
fraudulent
votes
were
cast.
we
have
this
problem
in
tennessee.
it
is
a
little
different
for
most
states
and
that
we
are
bounded
by
eight
states.
three
of
our
four
large
metropolitan
areas
are
on
the
state
lines.
in
the
case
of
memphis
which
is
our
largest
metropolitan
area,
three
states
bound
on
that
one
county,
arkansas,
mississippi
and
missouri.
now,
ever
since
the
reapportionment
decisions
and
the
breakdown
within
the
county
of
legislative
seats,
for
example,
took
place.
the
county
has
divided
into
these
various
legislative
seats
based
on
population,
of
course,
and
it
would
take
very
few
votes
to
change
the
outcome
of
an
election
in
many
of
these.
but
house
seat
changes
in
tennessee
would
change
the
complete
complexion
of
the
legislature
itself
for
that
matter.
the
possibility
of
colonization
is
just
too
greater
risk
we
feel
to
go
through
just
to
ensure
somebody
the
right
to
vote
in
one
election
at
the
very
most
before
he
would
otherwise
become
qualified
to
do
so.
now
when
you
start
trying
to
determine
who
is
going
to
draw
that
line,
all
we
have
to
do
is
just
look
at
what
has
happened
in
the
us
district
courts
already
in
regard
to
it
to
see
the
court’s
known
position
to
do
it.
the
people,
lacked
into
their
constitution,
we
feel,
are
in
position
to
do
it.
since
this
court
spoke
on
the
question,
i
think
at
least
12
federal
district
court’s
decisions.
four
of
them
sustained
the
four-year
residency
period.
that
was
in
ohio,
illinois,
arizona
and
washington.
three
found
the
one-year
residency
requirement
unconstitutional
but
upheld
shorter
periods.
for
example,
in
the
burg
which
is
out
in
massachusetts,
the
first
one
of
them
i
believe,
it
was
decided.
the
court
there
held
that
six
months
in
the
county,
double
our
county
residency
requirement
was
fine
and
said
that
there
had
been
showing
of
a
compelling
state
interest
to
justify
the
additional
six
months
in
the
state.
and
that
therefore
is
discriminatory
against
someone
that
might
live
just
across
the
state
line
but
had
moved
and
been
there
more
than
six
months.
so,
that
is
the
situations
you
had.
in
fact,
one
of
the
amazing
things
about
this
case
when
it
was
heard
in
nashville
was
the
fact
that
direct
from
the
bench,
the
court
for
all
practical
purposes,
discounted
the
three
months
question
just
about
rule
from
the
bench
that
they
were
not
concerned
at
all
of
the
three
months.
there
did
not
see
anything
wrong
with
this.
they
were
only
concerned
of
whether
this
year
was
too
long.
and
then
to
our
amazement,
they
give
the
opinion.
they
struck
down
not
only
the
one-year
but
the
tree
months
in
the
county
provision,
which
could
not
be
discriminatory
and
viewed
in
any
line.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir,
until
such
time
as
you
get
reregistered.
in
other
words,
there
is
no
such
thing
as
subtle
first
of
all
from
being
able
to
vote.
we
have
got
to
see
--
the
virgin
is
required
to
take
place
90
days
before
an
election.
we
have
also
got
the
three
months
or
ninety
days
directly
to
change
from
one
precinct
to
another
or
from
one
county
to
another
and
you
could
still
go
back
to
the
other.
now,
you
can
go
ahead
and
register
in
the
new
county
as
soon
as
you
got
there
as
long
as
it
would
be
three
months
before
there
would
be
an
election.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir.
and
then
the
act
of
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir.
in
other
words,
until
such
time
as
he
would
have
been
able
to
live
new
county
to
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir,
or
he
is
never
really
cutoff.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
until
such
time
as
he
established
his
domicile
in
the
new
state
and
becomes
eligible
to
vote
there.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir.
whatever,
there
so
we
are
not
saying
there
are
few
states
that
do
not
have
registration
laws
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
no
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
they
could
come
back
and
do
it
in
person
or
by
absentee
in
their
law
that
could
return
to
tennessee
authority.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir.
an
example
of
the
inside
of
the
state,
intrastate
state
situation
of
that
--
i
have
been
in
nashville
now
for
17
years
and
i
still
vote
in
mountain
city
(ph).
it
is
still
my
home
and
so
what
i
think
--
that
is
my
home
and
where
i
expect
to
return.
and
so
long
as
that
is
established,
the
laws
in
tennessee
permits
that
voting
there
as
well.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir
if
i
--
but
i
do
not
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
davidson
county.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
we
--
traditionally,
the
purposes
of
residency
requirement
as
set
out
in
most
of
legal
publications
and
the
one
i
have
selected
to
use
here
is
from
(inaudible).
this
is
the
reason
for
it
to
ensure
security
of
a
ballot
box
through
proper
legislation
by
prediction
against
frauds
through
colonization
and
inability
to
identify
a
person
offering
the
vote.
and
two,
to
afford
some
surety
that
the
voter
has
in
fact
become
a
member
of
the
community
and
that
as
such,
he
has
a
common
manner
in
all
matters
pertained
to
its
government
and
therefore
he
is
likely
to
exercise
his
right
more
intelligently.
now,
those
are
the
reasons
we
say
that
there
is
a
need
for
benefit
that
boils
down
to
how
much
time
and
how
is
a
state
going
to
show
if
he
had
used
the
compelling
state
interest
doctrine,
however,
the
state
is
going
to
possibly
show
that
31
days
is
as
proper
as
opposed
to
45
days
or
60
days.
we
just
insist
that
it
is
a
thing
that
can
not
be
done,
and
it
has
been
recognized
by
this
court
on
all
previous
occasions
that
this
is
a
proper
regulation
by
the
state
and
the
state
residency
or
durational
residency
requirements
had
been
upheld
by
this
court
in
cases
here
before,
in
every
essence
that
it
has
been
challenged.
now
the
first
case
for
example
in
1904,
pope
versus
williams
coming
out
of
maryland
where
they
had
six
months
in
the
county
and
a
year
in
the
state
which
is
longer
than
tennessee’s
durational
residency
requirement.
this
court
upheld
those
requirements
and
in
doing
so,
stated
that
at
that
time
they
had
registration
already
in
maryland.
they
took
notice
of
what
this
court
did
of
the
fact
that
they
had
registration
there
and
said,
well,
we
might
personally
feel
that
the
one
year
is
too
long
now
in
due
of
having
registration.
at
the
same
time,
we
cannot
say
that
this
is
a
function
of
the
court
to
take
it
away
--
the
decision
away
from
the
state
of
maryland
and
its
people
in
deciding
this.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir
and
so
will
drueding
versus
devlin,
1964
case
would
necessarily
be
overruled
if
this
case
is
affirmed
barely
to
--
that
get
directly,
and
both
of
them
incidentally
awarded
from
the
state
the
maryland
where
the
one
year
in
the
state
and
six
months
in
the
county
was
involved.
now
in
addition
to
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir,
and
under
the
--
yes
sir,
and,
this
court
has
said
repeatedly
in
the
past
that
they
have
used
the
unreasonable
or
irresponsible
rule
in
the
time.
well,
now
that
is
done,
i
do
not
think
that
surely
the
one
year
in
the
state
or
at
least
the
three
months
in
the
county
could
be
conceived
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
one
year
is
--
it
is
more
difficult
of
course
to
justify
than
three
months.
i
would
not
agree
but
at
the
same
time,
i
think
it
is
a
question
of
who
is
to
make
that
determination.
as
we
have
found
here,
the
court
has
been
trying
to
make
it
if
they
went
another
direction.
the
12
different
us
district
courts
that
in
fact
decided
this,
none
of
them
have
agreed
on
what
it
is
or
what
it
ought
to
be.
not
a
single
one,
except
for
the
four
that
said
that
the
courts
have
no
business
ended
in
the
first
place
and
upheld
the
state
durational
residency
requirement.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir
for
registration
--
that
is
a
cutoff
for
registration,
but
the
purpose
--
but
what
i
was
attempting
to
explain
a
while
ago,
the
purpose
for
having
that
cut
off
is
not
the
same
purpose
that
you
obtained
from
having
a
durational
residency
requirement,
because
that
is
to
check
the
eligibility
of
the
voters.
if
in
that
last
30
days
while
you
are
trying
to
get
an
election
ready
to
go
with
all
the
appointment
of
the
officials,
the
ballot
prepared,
the
machines
service
--
now,
everything
like
that,
if
the
election
commissioners
are
tempted
to
at
that
time,
they
try
to
get
in
to
the
eligibility
of
voters,
many,
many
voters
would
probably
get
this
and
franchise
because
they
would
have
no
opportunity
to
overcome
it
before
the
election.
so
that
this
matter
of
--
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
no
sir.
the
district
court
recognized
that
30
days
was
all
right,
but
they
did
not
--mr.
blumstein
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir.
we
would
respectfully
insist
that
all
of
the
previous
cases
are
on
the
appellant
side
in
this
matter.
not
only
of
the
cases
that
i
have
cited
but
where
this
court
dealt
directly
with
the
proposition,
but
also,
on
interpreting
provisions
under
the
tenth
amendment
and
in
other
cases,
this
court
has
used
the
durational
residency
requirement
or
residency
power
of
a
state
for
voting
as
example,
a
state
power
that
still
left
to
it.
now,
that
was
true
in
kramer
versus
union
free
school
district
as
late
as
in
1969.
the
only
thing
that
the
us
district
court
could
have
gotten
their
key
from
was
when
this
court
granted
their
noted
proper
jurisdiction
in
hall
versus
beals
coming
out
in
colorado
which
later
was
dismissed
as
being
moot.
now,
there
was
no
other
law
that
the
district
courts
could
be
using
out
of
that
their
second
guess
in
this
court,
and,
that
is
all
--
all
the
basis
or
authority
that
they
could
have
for
hold
in
a
way
to
have
in
this
case.
i
just
want
to
say
one
other
thing
in
that
and
i
am
going
to
close
and
that
is,
in
1970,
mr.
chief
justice
in
the
walz
v.
tax
commission
of
the
city
of
new
york
quoted
from
the
old
jackman
case
where
mr.
justice
holmes
said
that
“if
a
thing
has
been
practiced
for
200
years
but
common
can
certainly
lead
a
strong
case
for
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
affect.”
we
think
that
is
what
you
have
here.
you
have
all
of
the
states
fixing
residential
or
residency
requirements
and
it
has
been
that
way
for
a
long
time
and
it
is
not
--
it
is
not
just
antiquated
provisions.
in
the
case
of
tennessee,
(inaudible)
point
this
out,
the
adversary
counsel
insists
and
the
court
has
even
handed
tort
in
their
opinion
that
the
registration
laws
took
the
place
of
the
residency
requirements
in
tennessee
and
that
that
was
a
stated
purpose
and
it
was
a
later
law.
well,
that
is
not
true.
in
1953,
it
is
when
the
people
had
the
chance
to
relook
at
the
durational
residency
requirement
provision
in
tennessee
and
their
constitution,
and
they
did
retain
the
one
year
in
the
state,
but
it
was
at
that
time
that
the
six
months
in
the
county
was
lowered
to
three
months.
so,
that
that
is
not
an
antiquated
provision
and
it
is
one
the
clearly
shows
that
the
people
want
in
their
constitutions
some
protection
against
voter
fraud
and
that
they
put
it
in
there
after
they
had
registration.
there
could
be
no
serious
argument
that
the
registration
law
and
the
30-day
cutoff
there
did
away
or
just
does
away
with
any
purpose
to
be
served
by
durational
residency
requirement.
so,
that
just
is
not
the
case.
i
might
have
just
a
short
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
one
of
things
i
wish
to
point
out
is
the
distinction
that
adversary
counsel
has
attempted
to
make
between
the
time
elements
of
durational
residence
in
saying
that
30
days,
there
would
be
no
discrimination
but
somehow
rather,
reading
into
it,
that
90
days
in
the
county
would
be.
i
submit
that
there
is
no
discrimination
there
as
found
in
the
burg
case
coming
out
of
massachusetts.
this
would
be
applicable
thereby
that
there
is
no
discrimination
at
all,
and
if
anybody
whether
he
had
lived
in
the
state
before
or
not,
after
three
months
in
the
county
where
he
proposes
to
vote,
would
be
entitled
to
do
so.
now
a
little
better
case
could
be
made
out
on
the
hype
of
what
he
has
alleged
in
regard
to
the
one
year
in
the
state,
because
there
you
could
be
discriminated
against
just
by
the
virtue
of
the
fact
that
you
lived
across
a
state
line
or
even
though
you
worked
back
and
fourth
during
the
year
and
then
moved
in
for
the
three
months
preceding
an
election
and
satisfied
the
country
requirement,
but
would
not
have
satisfied
the
state
requirement.
now,
there
was
one
other
thing
that
i
did
wish
to
point
out
to
the
court,
and
that
is
the
obvious
intent
of
congress
in
this
matter.
and
that
is
the
court
as
to
where
the
1970
voting
rights
act
amendment
originally
contained
the
provision
that
would
have
abolished
the
durational
residency
requirements
in
all
elections.
it
was
congress’s
decision
to
remove
that.
they
rejected
this
proposal,
yet
despite
that,
somehow
rather
our
district
court,
in
its
opinion,
has
read
into
that
an
interpretation
that
congress
really
is
supporting
the
proposition
of
abolishing
residency
requirement
when
actually
they
had
it
in
their
bill
and
then
took
it
out
on
their
own.
at
page
9
of
his
brief,
the
appellee,
in
discussing
whether
or
not
voter
waiting
period
is
beneficial
in
weeding
out
ineligible
voters,
concludes
that
anyone
who
is
willing
to
swear
falsely
that
he
is
an
ineligible
voter
would
is
just
as
readily
swear
falsely
that
he
had
been
in
the
state
for
a
year
and
then
a
county
for
three
months.
well,
that
just
does
not
necessarily
follow
at
all.
the
second
oath
could
be
proven
much
more
easily
than
the
other.
all
of
the
precinct
workers
at
an
election
are
local
to
the
voting
precincts.
the
judges
and
officers
and
all
are
local
people.
for
purposes
of
identity,
they
can
challenge
any
voter
that
comes
up
even
on
election
day,
if
they
have
an
opportunity
to
know
that
that
person
has
not
been
in
the
community
that
long,
they
can
challenge
him
and
the
election
commission
decide
itself
then
whether
he
really
is
entitled
to
cast
that
ballot.
but,
there
is
no
other
way
except
for
having
a
time
element
involved
in
the
community,
i
submit,
that
for
the
local
people
to
be
able
to
pull
out
the
illegal
voter.
now
this
could
be
a
very
serious
thing
in
connection
with
the
question
of
mobility.
that
is
a
two-way
sword.
not
only
there
are
lot
more
people
moving
intrastate
and
interstate
as
a
result
of
the
type
of
society
that
we
now
have,
but
that
also
goes
the
other
way
too
and
it
offers
an
opportunity
for
a
type
of
fraud
that
before
could
not
have
existed.
i
submit
that
(inaudible)
in
his
state
and
my
state
would
have
had
a
field
day
out
of
a
30-day
cutoff
deadline
and
no
other
resident
requirements
for
voters.
that
is
just
the
way
it
works.
i
had
the
opportunity
a
few
years
ago
to
be
an
state
election
coordinator
in
my
home
state,
and
while
at
that,
i
organized
the
statewide
association
of
county
election
commissioners,
and
i
have
heard
every
kind
of
complaints
and
i
submit
that
if
there
is
any
way
of
stealing
election,
somebody
has
got
a
way
to
figure
out
how
to
do
it.
and,
every
time
that
we
opened
a
gate
like
that
and
let
fraud
get
into
our
elections,
then
the
republic
an
form
of
government
that
article
iv
section
4
of
our
constitution
guarantees,
no
longer
will
be
applicable
to
it.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
three-judge
district
court
of
the
middle
district
of
tennessee
and
i
suppose
to
struck
down
the
durational
residency
requirements
for
voting
as
provided
by
the
state
constitution
and
implemented
by
statues
of
the
legislature.
the
time
fixed
in
tennessee
for
durational
residency
requirements
was
one
year
in
the
state
and
three
months
in
the
county
for
the
person
offers
himself
to
vote.
the
question
presented
is
whether
or
not
such
constitutional
and
statutory
provisions
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
and
whether
or
not
in
determining
this,
the
doctrine
of
irrational
or
unreasonable
or
the
compelling
state
interest
doctrine
is
to
be
made
applicable
in
this
kind
of
a
case
in
part
of
determination
of
this
case.
at
the
time,
this
case
was
decided
by
the
district
court
and
so
far
as
this
counsel
has
any
way
of
ascertaining
now,
33
states
and
three
territories
had
the
durational
residence
requirements
of
at
least
the
one
year
as
the
case
in
tennessee;
15
states
had
a
six-month
residency
requirement
which
is
double
to
the
county
residence
requirement
provided
for
in
the
state
of
tennessee.
the
remaining
two
states
had
respectfully
190
days
and
the
other
three
months
the
residency
requirement.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
no
sir,
not
to
my
knowledge,
if
your
honor
please,
that
is
where
we
think
that
the
district
court
erred
in
trying
to
make
such
a
determination
based
on
the
registration
cutoff
deadline
of
30
days,
which
implies
in
tennessee
and
in
most
of
the
states
that
have
registration
laws,
but,
it
is
our
insistence
that
the
court
was
in
error
there
because
that
cutoff
period
is
designed
specifically
and
it
is
very
clearly
shown
in
the
law
to
be
for
the
purpose
of
permitting
the
county
election
officials,
the
necessary
time
to
make
the
administrative
acts
that
they
are
required
to
do.
for
example,
they
have
to
take
your
master
registration
list
and
break
that
down
precinct
by
precinct
and
make
duplicates
of
it
throughout
to
the
precinct.
they
got
to
run
their
advertisements
and
the
paper
notices
of
the
election,
select
all
of
the
judges
and
officers
to
hold
the
election
at
the
precinct
level
and
it
is
countless
number
of
things.
no
word
during
that
period
of
time
can
be
election
commission
in
tennessee
and
i
think
it
is
generally
true
at
everywhere
else
use
that
period
of
time
to
purge
an
ineligible
voter.
therefore
the
durational
residency
requirement
is
necessary,
we
feel,
in
order
to
give
some
time
for
which
the
election
commission
can
get
rid
of
any
ineligible
voters,
purge
them
as
the
case
might
be,
and
then,
the
30-day
registration
cutoff
only
for
administrative
period
and
things
alone,
because
somewhere
there
has
got
to
be
a
period
of
time
when
the
voter
knows
that
he
is
going
to
be
entitled
to
go
to
the
booth
and
vote
and
that
is
what
we
think
the
30
days
is
for.
now,
as
far
as
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
of
course
--
we
of
course
we
have
not
had
a
presidential
election
since
then.
we
do
not
yet
how
it
is
going
to
work
out.
i
do
not
think
that
there
would
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
sir?
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir.
30-day
registration
cutoff.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir.
well,
tennessee,
if
your
honor
please,
already
had
done
this
before
the
1970
voting
rights
act
was
passed.
that
is
one
of
the
things
that
i
wanted
to
point
out
to
court.
there
are
other
ways
of
doing
it
besides
in
effect
reinterpreting
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
order
to
bring
it
about.
in
tennessee,
anybody
that
moves
within
a
precinct
or
anywhere
else
in
the
state
has
90
days
in
which
to
qualify
himself
in
the
new
area
or
until
that
period
of
time,
he
can
go
back
and
vote
where
he
had
always
voted
either
in
person
or
by
absentee
ballot.
he
is
never
disfranchised.
the
same
is
true
so
far
as
the
year
and
the
state
is
concerned
by
act
--
legislature
even
before
the
1970
voting
rights.
we
provided
that
in
tennessee
any
person
who
live
in
that
state
would
maintain
his
domicile,
which
in
tennessee
is
the
same
as
legal
residence,
he
would
maintain
that
domicile
until
such
time
as
he
acquired
a
new
one
and
no
matter
what
state
he
went
to.
and,
we
think
that
that
is
an
essential
way
of
doing
it,
so
that
you
are
protecting
the
people
that
usually
would
have
the
most
standards.
it
takes
some
little
time.
i
think
the
court
can
take
a
notice
of
the
fact
that
a
person
who
has
lived
a
number
of
years
in
a
county
and
then
he
moves,
it
is
a
little
while
that
he
would
prefer
to
be
identified
back
where
he
had
been
for
any
period
of
time
as
opposed
to
immediately
entering
into
the
political
arena
in
a
new
place.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir,
we
do.
the
problem
with
this
though
if
you
go
to
confine
it
through
registration
deadline,
for
example,
as
it
is
determining,
whether
or
not
the
person
really
is
a
bona
fide
resident
of
the
state.
now,
the
district
court
in
striking
down
a
year
and
the
state
and
the
three
months
in
the
county,
did
indicate
that
they
felt
that
the
30-day
registration
deadline
was
sufficient
to
accomplish
this,
and
it
then
argued
in
opposing
counsel’s
brief
that
anybody
that
would
go
into
the
registrar’s
office
and
be
willing
to
make
an
oath
that
he
is
a
bona
fide
resident
would
also
be
willing
to
make
an
oath
and
swear
a
lie
about
anything
else
that
would
be
necessary
to
do
this.
but,
that
does
not
follow
because
it
is
nebulas
sort
of
thing.
the
matter
of
whether
a
person
is
a
bona
fide
resident
is
almost
decided
on
the
matter
of
intent.
now,
you
can
very
well
leave
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir,
that
is
true
if
this
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
and
this
court
upholds
the
lower
court’s
decision
that
that
would
be
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir.
they
are
already
raged
them,
you
see,
under
this
three-judged
court
ordered
down
there
act
of
the
30
days,
if
they
have
been
there
over
thirty
days
and
have
satisfied
the
requirements
of
being
a
bona
fide
resident.
now
so
there
--
we
have
already
had
an
election
in
other
words
since
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
since
this
was
changed,
yes
sir.
the
november
general
election
the
last
year.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
no
sir.
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
how
many
fraudulent
votes
were
cast.
we
have
this
problem
in
tennessee.
it
is
a
little
different
for
most
states
and
that
we
are
bounded
by
eight
states.
three
of
our
four
large
metropolitan
areas
are
on
the
state
lines.
in
the
case
of
memphis
which
is
our
largest
metropolitan
area,
three
states
bound
on
that
one
county,
arkansas,
mississippi
and
missouri.
now,
ever
since
the
reapportionment
decisions
and
the
breakdown
within
the
county
of
legislative
seats,
for
example,
took
place.
the
county
has
divided
into
these
various
legislative
seats
based
on
population,
of
course,
and
it
would
take
very
few
votes
to
change
the
outcome
of
an
election
in
many
of
these.
but
house
seat
changes
in
tennessee
would
change
the
complete
complexion
of
the
legislature
itself
for
that
matter.
the
possibility
of
colonization
is
just
too
greater
risk
we
feel
to
go
through
just
to
ensure
somebody
the
right
to
vote
in
one
election
at
the
very
most
before
he
would
otherwise
become
qualified
to
do
so.
now
when
you
start
trying
to
determine
who
is
going
to
draw
that
line,
all
we
have
to
do
is
just
look
at
what
has
happened
in
the
us
district
courts
already
in
regard
to
it
to
see
the
court’s
known
position
to
do
it.
the
people,
lacked
into
their
constitution,
we
feel,
are
in
position
to
do
it.
since
this
court
spoke
on
the
question,
i
think
at
least
12
federal
district
court’s
decisions.
four
of
them
sustained
the
four-year
residency
period.
that
was
in
ohio,
illinois,
arizona
and
washington.
three
found
the
one-year
residency
requirement
unconstitutional
but
upheld
shorter
periods.
for
example,
in
the
burg
which
is
out
in
massachusetts,
the
first
one
of
them
i
believe,
it
was
decided.
the
court
there
held
that
six
months
in
the
county,
double
our
county
residency
requirement
was
fine
and
said
that
there
had
been
showing
of
a
compelling
state
interest
to
justify
the
additional
six
months
in
the
state.
and
that
therefore
is
discriminatory
against
someone
that
might
live
just
across
the
state
line
but
had
moved
and
been
there
more
than
six
months.
so,
that
is
the
situations
you
had.
in
fact,
one
of
the
amazing
things
about
this
case
when
it
was
heard
in
nashville
was
the
fact
that
direct
from
the
bench,
the
court
for
all
practical
purposes,
discounted
the
three
months
question
just
about
rule
from
the
bench
that
they
were
not
concerned
at
all
of
the
three
months.
there
did
not
see
anything
wrong
with
this.
they
were
only
concerned
of
whether
this
year
was
too
long.
and
then
to
our
amazement,
they
give
the
opinion.
they
struck
down
not
only
the
one-year
but
the
tree
months
in
the
county
provision,
which
could
not
be
discriminatory
and
viewed
in
any
line.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir,
until
such
time
as
you
get
reregistered.
in
other
words,
there
is
no
such
thing
as
subtle
first
of
all
from
being
able
to
vote.
we
have
got
to
see
--
the
virgin
is
required
to
take
place
90
days
before
an
election.
we
have
also
got
the
three
months
or
ninety
days
directly
to
change
from
one
precinct
to
another
or
from
one
county
to
another
and
you
could
still
go
back
to
the
other.
now,
you
can
go
ahead
and
register
in
the
new
county
as
soon
as
you
got
there
as
long
as
it
would
be
three
months
before
there
would
be
an
election.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir.
and
then
the
act
of
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir.
in
other
words,
until
such
time
as
he
would
have
been
able
to
live
new
county
to
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir,
or
he
is
never
really
cutoff.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
until
such
time
as
he
established
his
domicile
in
the
new
state
and
becomes
eligible
to
vote
there.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir.
whatever,
there
so
we
are
not
saying
there
are
few
states
that
do
not
have
registration
laws
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
no
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
they
could
come
back
and
do
it
in
person
or
by
absentee
in
their
law
that
could
return
to
tennessee
authority.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir.
an
example
of
the
inside
of
the
state,
intrastate
state
situation
of
that
--
i
have
been
in
nashville
now
for
17
years
and
i
still
vote
in
mountain
city
(ph).
it
is
still
my
home
and
so
what
i
think
--
that
is
my
home
and
where
i
expect
to
return.
and
so
long
as
that
is
established,
the
laws
in
tennessee
permits
that
voting
there
as
well.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir
if
i
--
but
i
do
not
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
davidson
county.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
we
--
traditionally,
the
purposes
of
residency
requirement
as
set
out
in
most
of
legal
publications
and
the
one
i
have
selected
to
use
here
is
from
(inaudible).
this
is
the
reason
for
it
to
ensure
security
of
a
ballot
box
through
proper
legislation
by
prediction
against
frauds
through
colonization
and
inability
to
identify
a
person
offering
the
vote.
and
two,
to
afford
some
surety
that
the
voter
has
in
fact
become
a
member
of
the
community
and
that
as
such,
he
has
a
common
manner
in
all
matters
pertained
to
its
government
and
therefore
he
is
likely
to
exercise
his
right
more
intelligently.
now,
those
are
the
reasons
we
say
that
there
is
a
need
for
benefit
that
boils
down
to
how
much
time
and
how
is
a
state
going
to
show
if
he
had
used
the
compelling
state
interest
doctrine,
however,
the
state
is
going
to
possibly
show
that
31
days
is
as
proper
as
opposed
to
45
days
or
60
days.
we
just
insist
that
it
is
a
thing
that
can
not
be
done,
and
it
has
been
recognized
by
this
court
on
all
previous
occasions
that
this
is
a
proper
regulation
by
the
state
and
the
state
residency
or
durational
residency
requirements
had
been
upheld
by
this
court
in
cases
here
before,
in
every
essence
that
it
has
been
challenged.
now
the
first
case
for
example
in
1904,
pope
versus
williams
coming
out
of
maryland
where
they
had
six
months
in
the
county
and
a
year
in
the
state
which
is
longer
than
tennessee’s
durational
residency
requirement.
this
court
upheld
those
requirements
and
in
doing
so,
stated
that
at
that
time
they
had
registration
already
in
maryland.
they
took
notice
of
what
this
court
did
of
the
fact
that
they
had
registration
there
and
said,
well,
we
might
personally
feel
that
the
one
year
is
too
long
now
in
due
of
having
registration.
at
the
same
time,
we
cannot
say
that
this
is
a
function
of
the
court
to
take
it
away
--
the
decision
away
from
the
state
of
maryland
and
its
people
in
deciding
this.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir
and
so
will
drueding
versus
devlin,
1964
case
would
necessarily
be
overruled
if
this
case
is
affirmed
barely
to
--
that
get
directly,
and
both
of
them
incidentally
awarded
from
the
state
the
maryland
where
the
one
year
in
the
state
and
six
months
in
the
county
was
involved.
now
in
addition
to
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir,
and
under
the
--
yes
sir,
and,
this
court
has
said
repeatedly
in
the
past
that
they
have
used
the
unreasonable
or
irresponsible
rule
in
the
time.
well,
now
that
is
done,
i
do
not
think
that
surely
the
one
year
in
the
state
or
at
least
the
three
months
in
the
county
could
be
conceived
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
one
year
is
--
it
is
more
difficult
of
course
to
justify
than
three
months.
i
would
not
agree
but
at
the
same
time,
i
think
it
is
a
question
of
who
is
to
make
that
determination.
as
we
have
found
here,
the
court
has
been
trying
to
make
it
if
they
went
another
direction.
the
12
different
us
district
courts
that
in
fact
decided
this,
none
of
them
have
agreed
on
what
it
is
or
what
it
ought
to
be.
not
a
single
one,
except
for
the
four
that
said
that
the
courts
have
no
business
ended
in
the
first
place
and
upheld
the
state
durational
residency
requirement.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir
for
registration
--
that
is
a
cutoff
for
registration,
but
the
purpose
--
but
what
i
was
attempting
to
explain
a
while
ago,
the
purpose
for
having
that
cut
off
is
not
the
same
purpose
that
you
obtained
from
having
a
durational
residency
requirement,
because
that
is
to
check
the
eligibility
of
the
voters.
if
in
that
last
30
days
while
you
are
trying
to
get
an
election
ready
to
go
with
all
the
appointment
of
the
officials,
the
ballot
prepared,
the
machines
service
--
now,
everything
like
that,
if
the
election
commissioners
are
tempted
to
at
that
time,
they
try
to
get
in
to
the
eligibility
of
voters,
many,
many
voters
would
probably
get
this
and
franchise
because
they
would
have
no
opportunity
to
overcome
it
before
the
election.
so
that
this
matter
of
--
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
no
sir.
the
district
court
recognized
that
30
days
was
all
right,
but
they
did
not
--mr.
blumstein
--
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
yes
sir.
we
would
respectfully
insist
that
all
of
the
previous
cases
are
on
the
appellant
side
in
this
matter.
not
only
of
the
cases
that
i
have
cited
but
where
this
court
dealt
directly
with
the
proposition,
but
also,
on
interpreting
provisions
under
the
tenth
amendment
and
in
other
cases,
this
court
has
used
the
durational
residency
requirement
or
residency
power
of
a
state
for
voting
as
example,
a
state
power
that
still
left
to
it.
now,
that
was
true
in
kramer
versus
union
free
school
district
as
late
as
in
1969.
the
only
thing
that
the
us
district
court
could
have
gotten
their
key
from
was
when
this
court
granted
their
noted
proper
jurisdiction
in
hall
versus
beals
coming
out
in
colorado
which
later
was
dismissed
as
being
moot.
now,
there
was
no
other
law
that
the
district
courts
could
be
using
out
of
that
their
second
guess
in
this
court,
and,
that
is
all
--
all
the
basis
or
authority
that
they
could
have
for
hold
in
a
way
to
have
in
this
case.
i
just
want
to
say
one
other
thing
in
that
and
i
am
going
to
close
and
that
is,
in
1970,
mr.
chief
justice
in
the
walz
v.
tax
commission
of
the
city
of
new
york
quoted
from
the
old
jackman
case
where
mr.
justice
holmes
said
that
“if
a
thing
has
been
practiced
for
200
years
but
common
can
certainly
lead
a
strong
case
for
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
affect.”
we
think
that
is
what
you
have
here.
you
have
all
of
the
states
fixing
residential
or
residency
requirements
and
it
has
been
that
way
for
a
long
time
and
it
is
not
--
it
is
not
just
antiquated
provisions.
in
the
case
of
tennessee,
(inaudible)
point
this
out,
the
adversary
counsel
insists
and
the
court
has
even
handed
tort
in
their
opinion
that
the
registration
laws
took
the
place
of
the
residency
requirements
in
tennessee
and
that
that
was
a
stated
purpose
and
it
was
a
later
law.
well,
that
is
not
true.
in
1953,
it
is
when
the
people
had
the
chance
to
relook
at
the
durational
residency
requirement
provision
in
tennessee
and
their
constitution,
and
they
did
retain
the
one
year
in
the
state,
but
it
was
at
that
time
that
the
six
months
in
the
county
was
lowered
to
three
months.
so,
that
that
is
not
an
antiquated
provision
and
it
is
one
the
clearly
shows
that
the
people
want
in
their
constitutions
some
protection
against
voter
fraud
and
that
they
put
it
in
there
after
they
had
registration.
there
could
be
no
serious
argument
that
the
registration
law
and
the
30-day
cutoff
there
did
away
or
just
does
away
with
any
purpose
to
be
served
by
durational
residency
requirement.
so,
that
just
is
not
the
case.
i
might
have
just
a
short
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
h.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
one
of
things
i
wish
to
point
out
is
the
distinction
that
adversary
counsel
has
attempted
to
make
between
the
time
elements
of
durational
residence
in
saying
that
30
days,
there
would
be
no
discrimination
but
somehow
rather,
reading
into
it,
that
90
days
in
the
county
would
be.
i
submit
that
there
is
no
discrimination
there
as
found
in
the
burg
case
coming
out
of
massachusetts.
this
would
be
applicable
thereby
that
there
is
no
discrimination
at
all,
and
if
anybody
whether
he
had
lived
in
the
state
before
or
not,
after
three
months
in
the
county
where
he
proposes
to
vote,
would
be
entitled
to
do
so.
now
a
little
better
case
could
be
made
out
on
the
hype
of
what
he
has
alleged
in
regard
to
the
one
year
in
the
state,
because
there
you
could
be
discriminated
against
just
by
the
virtue
of
the
fact
that
you
lived
across
a
state
line
or
even
though
you
worked
back
and
fourth
during
the
year
and
then
moved
in
for
the
three
months
preceding
an
election
and
satisfied
the
country
requirement,
but
would
not
have
satisfied
the
state
requirement.
now,
there
was
one
other
thing
that
i
did
wish
to
point
out
to
the
court,
and
that
is
the
obvious
intent
of
congress
in
this
matter.
and
that
is
the
court
as
to
where
the
1970
voting
rights
act
amendment
originally
contained
the
provision
that
would
have
abolished
the
durational
residency
requirements
in
all
elections.
it
was
congress’s
decision
to
remove
that.
they
rejected
this
proposal,
yet
despite
that,
somehow
rather
our
district
court,
in
its
opinion,
has
read
into
that
an
interpretation
that
congress
really
is
supporting
the
proposition
of
abolishing
residency
requirement
when
actually
they
had
it
in
their
bill
and
then
took
it
out
on
their
own.
at
page
9
of
his
brief,
the
appellee,
in
discussing
whether
or
not
voter
waiting
period
is
beneficial
in
weeding
out
ineligible
voters,
concludes
that
anyone
who
is
willing
to
swear
falsely
that
he
is
an
ineligible
voter
would
is
just
as
readily
swear
falsely
that
he
had
been
in
the
state
for
a
year
and
then
a
county
for
three
months.
well,
that
just
does
not
necessarily
follow
at
all.
the
second
oath
could
be
proven
much
more
easily
than
the
other.
all
of
the
precinct
workers
at
an
election
are
local
to
the
voting
precincts.
the
judges
and
officers
and
all
are
local
people.
for
purposes
of
identity,
they
can
challenge
any
voter
that
comes
up
even
on
election
day,
if
they
have
an
opportunity
to
know
that
that
person
has
not
been
in
the
community
that
long,
they
can
challenge
him
and
the
election
commission
decide
itself
then
whether
he
really
is
entitled
to
cast
that
ballot.
but,
there
is
no
other
way
except
for
having
a
time
element
involved
in
the
community,
i
submit,
that
for
the
local
people
to
be
able
to
pull
out
the
illegal
voter.
now
this
could
be
a
very
serious
thing
in
connection
with
the
question
of
mobility.
that
is
a
two-way
sword.
not
only
there
are
lot
more
people
moving
intrastate
and
interstate
as
a
result
of
the
type
of
society
that
we
now
have,
but
that
also
goes
the
other
way
too
and
it
offers
an
opportunity
for
a
type
of
fraud
that
before
could
not
have
existed.
i
submit
that
(inaudible)
in
his
state
and
my
state
would
have
had
a
field
day
out
of
a
30-day
cutoff
deadline
and
no
other
resident
requirements
for
voters.
that
is
just
the
way
it
works.
i
had
the
opportunity
a
few
years
ago
to
be
an
state
election
coordinator
in
my
home
state,
and
while
at
that,
i
organized
the
statewide
association
of
county
election
commissioners,
and
i
have
heard
every
kind
of
complaints
and
i
submit
that
if
there
is
any
way
of
stealing
election,
somebody
has
got
a
way
to
figure

every
time
that
we
opened
a
