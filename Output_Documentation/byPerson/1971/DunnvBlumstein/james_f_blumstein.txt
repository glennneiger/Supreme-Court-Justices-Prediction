mr.
james
f.
blumstein
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
is
important
to
understand
that
the
first
measure
that
this
case
does
not
involve
the
question
of
residency.
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
that
i
am
a
bona
fide
resident
of
the
state.
the
state
has
conceded
this
throughout
and
the
district
court
found
this
as
a
fact.
there
is
no
question
that
i
meet
the
standards
of
domicile
that
tennessee
imposes
as
its
standard
residence.
so,
the
state’s
argument
entirely
has
been
pitched
to
the
fact
that
there
is
a
question
of
residency
here.
this
is
not
a
question
of
residency.
this
is
a
question
of
an
additional
separate
factor
and
that
is
a
calendar
waiting
period
beyond
the
bona
fide
residency
criteria.
there
is
currently
in
tennessee
--
the
law
revision
commission
of
tennessee
is
currently
under
a
mandate
of
the
legislature
to
revise
the
election
code.
and
a
specific
section
of
that
tentative
draft
of
the
revision
goes
to
the
question
of
defining
bona
fide
residents.
tennessee
is
now
planning
to
adapt
the
standards
of
new
mexico
setting
out
several
indicia
in
criteria
of
determining
bona
fide
residents.
duration
of
residence
is
a
separate
category;
it
is
not
within
one
of
these
factors.
so,
i
just
want
to
make
that
perfectly
clear
at
the
outset.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
mr.
justice
stewart,
there
are
several
points
that
i
can
make
a
response
to
that.
first,
there
is
a
30-day
cutoff
period
for
registration.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
if
a
person
comes
in
to
the
state
of
tennessee
and
establishes
its
domicile,
according
to
the
relevant
tennessee
standards,
you
would
look
at
whether
he
has
become
a
domicile
for
tax
purpose,
you
would
look
at
whether
he
becomes
a
domicile
for
purposes
of
his
driver’s
license,
his
automobile
registration
and
so
forth.
if
he
meets
those
criteria,
either
separate
independent
criteria
that
the
election
commission
and
the
county
registrars
are
entitled
to
investigate.
if
after
their
investigation
at
the
time
of
registration,
it
is
their
conclusion
that
a
new
resident
is
a
bona
fide
resident,
then,
it
is
my
contention
that
there
is
a
discrimination
that
this
court
must
then
review
under
the
compelling
interest
standards.
just
showing
the
discrimination,
your
honor,
is
not
the
answer
to
a
constitutional
question.
at
that
point,
it
triggers
a
strict
constitutional
standard
of
review
and
then
we
must
go
into
the
policy
questions
that
the
state
articulates
to
support
this
discrimination.
so,
my
answer
to
your
question
then
is,
yes,
it
does
trigger
strict
review
and
know
that
the
state
does
not
meet
-
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
yes
sir,
under
those
circumstances
unless
the
state
can
show
a
compelling
reason
to
discriminate
against
this
bona
fide
resident,
it
is
the
constitutional
obligation
of
the
state
to
allow
him
to
vote.
and
there
are
other
classes
of
people
perhaps
in
certain
situations
that
may
be
able
to
--
the
state
may
be
able
to
discriminate
against
as
far
as
the
franchise
is
concerned.
for
example,
many
states
discriminate
against
felons
who
have
already
been
convicted,
and
even
though
they
are
bona
fide
residents,
they
may
be
eliminated
from
the
franchise.
but,
that
is
not
the
case
here,
your
honor.
these
are
not
a
class
of
insane
committed
people
or
felons,
these
are
qualified
voters
in
every
other
respect
except
as
far
as
durational
residence
are
concerned.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
yes,
your
honor;
that
is
correct.
under
existing
tennessee
law,
to
take
your
hypothetical
a
step
further,
if
a
person
were
to
move
to
the
state
--
suppose
someone
in
my
situation
was
is
an
academic.
he
moved
to
the
state,
buy
a
house
and
then
go
on
a
sabbatical
leave
for
the
first
year
of
his
tenure
out
of
a
university,
for
example.
he
never
appeared
in
the
state;
he
never
have
anything
to
do
whatsoever
with
the
politics
of
the
state
or
go
to
rush
ro
go
anywhere
and
come
back
one
year
later
precisely
having
no
contact
whatsoever
with
the
state
and
he
would
be
allowed
to
vote
because
he
would
be
a
domiciliary.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
well,
that
specifically
the
--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
i
believe
your
honor
that
would
be
covered
by
the
most
recent
twenty
sixth
amendment
which
stipulates
18
years
old
for
all
elections.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
well,
i
think
it
would
be
specifically
barred
by
the
twenty
sixth
amendment
from
doing
that.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
my
understanding
is
that
the
twenty
sixth
amendment
covers
both,
your
honor.
this
court’s
opinion
in
united
states
against
arizona
or
oregon
against
mitchell
covered,
restricted
only
to
federal
elections,
but,
the
twenty
sixth
amendment
specifically
covers
all
elections.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
under
this
court’s
opinion
in
oregon
against
mitchell,
i
think
it
certainly
could.
it
would
face
the
penalty
however,
your
honor,
under
section
2
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
establishes
a
21-year-old
age
requirement.
it
would
then
lose
the
aliquot
share
if
its
representation
in
congress.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
yes,
your
honor;
that
is
right.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
no,
your
honor,
justice
blackmun.
the
30-day
provision
is
not
discriminatory.
this
applies
equally
to
all
residents
of
the
state.
the
only
issue
under
attack
here
is
the
discriminatory
aspect.
so
there
is
no
--
there
is
an
administrative
period
that
the
state
has
said
is
necessary
to
prepare
voter
list
and
do
other
administrative
matters
prior
to
an
election.
it
was
this
30-day
period
by
the
way
that
the
district
court
relied
upon
to
deny
the
preliminary
injunction
in
this
case.
the
hearing
occurred
on
july
the
30th
in
the
district
court
and
the
primary
election
was
set
for
august
the
6th,
it
was
only
one
week
later.
and,
the
court
refused
to
interfere
not
because
it
said
the
three-month
period
was
reasonable
but
because
they
thought
it
would
be
judicially
improper.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
provided
that
you
are
within
the
30-day
--
provided
the
registration
books
were
open
which
only
occurs
more
than
30
days
before
the
election.
what
i
am
--
mr.
justice
blackmun,
the
position
that
the
appellee
is
taking
is
that
new
residents
must
be
permitted
to
register
under
the
same
standards
and
under
the
same
criteria
as
long
time
residents.
if
a
long
time
resident
happens
to
delay
his
attempt
to
register
beyond
the
30-day
period,
then
he
is
disfranchised
too,
and
we
are
not
asking
for
any
greater
or
special
treatment
for
new
residents.
all
the
appellee
is
seeking
is
that
new
residents
be
treated
the
same
as
long
time
residents.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
not
if
it
is
--
within
that
30-day
period,
no
sir.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
no
sir.
that
remains
after
this
case.
i
think
i
may
point
out
to
the
court
that
that
is
an
obvious
loophole
in
appellee’s
theory.
if
the
state
for
the
example
were
legislatively
to
argue
that
35
or
40
days
were
the
appropriate
period
and
this
would
apply
equally
to
all
new
residents
and
old
residents
alike,
this
would
be,
if
you
will,
a
backdoor
away
of
achieving
some
of
the
same
objectives.
i
think
that
administratively,
this
would
cause
chaos
because
of
the
30-day
period
congress
has
set
in
the
1970
voting
rights
act.
but,
i
think
that
it
is
clear
and
i
think
i
have
made
that
point
in
the
brief
that
this
is
a
potential
loophole
that
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
there
is
permanent
registration
but
they
are
all
provisions
for
purging
if
you
do
not
vote
for
a
certain
number
of
years.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
yes
sir.
at
this
point,
i
think
it
would
be
relevant
to
talk
about
what
the
discrimination
is.
i
have
talked
about
discrimination
between
new
and
old
residents.
well,
the
state
of
tennessee
is
a
homogenous
community
and
nashville,
davidson
county
is
a
homogenous
community
that
is
stable
over
time.
well,
this
flies
in
the
face
of
census
statistics.
americans
are
extremely
mobile
people.
over
the
course
of
a
very
few
years,
the
entire
character
of
a
community
may
change.
communities
are
in
no
sense
stable
in
the
unites
states.
each
year
for
example,
more
than
13
million
people
move
from
one
county
to
another.
and
of
those,
more
than
7
million
move
from
one
state
to
another.
this
represents
an
annual
interstate
migration
almost
the
size
of
the
city
of
new
york.
moreover,
of
those
almost
4,500,000
people
of
voting
age
adults,
who
move
from
one
state
to
another,
are
disfranchised.
in
addition,
census
figures
estimate
that
the
total
disfranchisement
from
these
residency
period
is
5,590,000
people
throughout
the
united
states.
this
is
a
staggering
figure
and
it
represents
about
7.7%
of
the
total
vote
cast
in
the
1968
presidential
election.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
your
honor,
the
7.7
figure?
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
that
was
a
percent
of
the
actual
vote
cast.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
no,
your
honor.
that
does
make
that
assumption.
the
census
refined
that
figure.
in
a
questionnaire
they
asked
people
who
were
potentially
disfranchised,
who
were
not
eligible
to
vote
because
of
these
durational
residency
requirements,
and
census
figure
show
that
3,022,000
of
those
numbers
would
have,
according
to
a
questionnaire,
would
have
participated
in
the
election.
the
figure
is
smaller
when
you
only
look
at
those
who
would
have
participated.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
well,
it
is
possible,
your
honor,
the
amicus
points
out
that
it
might
overstate
the
actual
disfranchisement
of
those
who
would
vote.
however,
i
would
like
to
point
out
in
this
regard,
one
of
the
characteristics
of
the
class
of
new
residents
are
that
they
typically
have
higher
educational
levels.
they
tend
to
have
finished
high
school
more
frequently
than
the
rest
of
the
population
and
if
they
tend
to
have
to
been
at
least
to
some
college
to
a
significant
degree
more
than
the
rest
of
the
population.
there
is
also
evidence
to
show,
your
honor,
that
people
who
have
higher
degrees
of
education
who
typically
find
themselves
in
white
collar
and
professional
occupations
are
tend
to
participate
more
frequently
in
the
election
process.
and
therefore,
i
think
the
figure
is
not
as
overstated
as
it
might
seem
on
its
face.
the
new
residents,
i
think
typically
do
participate
as
a
group
more
because
of
these
characteristics.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
yes,
your
honor.
the
district
court
was
handed
down
on
september
9,
1970,
and
since
that
time,
two
general
elections
and
one
primary
election
have
been
held
in
the
state
of
tennessee.
it
might
be
interesting
to
add
that
tennessee
was
a
major
political
battle
ground
in
1970
where
a
former
senator
gore
was
defeated
by
the
incumbent
senator
brock.
this
was
an
election
of
nationwide
significance.
and
since
this
decision
was
one
of
the
earliest
handed
down
by
the
district
court
involving
durational
residency,
there
was
no
question
that
it
got
widespread
dissemination
among
all
the
neighboring
states
in
tennessee.
and,
there
was
ample
opportunity
with
colonization
of
the
other
fraudulent
devices
of
the
state
it
refers
to,
and
there
was
no
evidence
whatsoever
and
it
was
reported
to
me
of
any
problems
in
this
regards,
to
be
sure
that
the
registrar
of
davidson
county
did
make
the
statement
that
she
would
have
to
ensure
a
bicycle
rack
in
front
of
her
county
courthouse,
but
this
is
the
kind
of
armchair
assertion
that
is
not
backed
up
by
any
data
at
all.
there
was
no
evidence
whatsoever
of
fraud;
there
was
no
data
that
the
state
has
brought
to
bear
on
this
question.
in
discussing
the
constitutional
claim,
it
is
essential
to
look
at
the
alternatives
that
the
state
has
in
order
to
prevent
frauds,
since
we
seem
to
have
focused
on
fraud.
the
voter
registration
system
was
not
--
statewide
voter
registration
did
not
come
in
being
in
tennessee
until
1951.
the
expressed
purpose
of
voter
registration,
as
stated
in
the
statute,
is
to
protect
the
purity
of
the
ballot.
the
district
court
found
this
as
a
fact.
there
is
no
interest
that
the
state
is
protecting
by
duration
of
residency
that
cannot
be
protected
in
determining
bona
fide
residents
at
the
time
of
registration.
there
is
no
additional
protection
that
the
period
of
durational
residency
provides
at
all.
and
the
state
--
just
this
morning
in
fact,
in
discussing
the
need
to
purge
voters
and
so
forth,
does
not
go
to
the
question
of
why
at
the
time
of
registration,
the
state
cannot
make
the
determination
of
bona
fide
residence.
this
is
the
role
of
registration.
in
fact,
there
are
figures
to
indicate
that
the
system
of
voter
registration
itself
has
raised
a
great
obstacle
for
voter
turnout.
voter
turnout
in
the
last
three
presidential
elections
did
not
match
at
all
with
what
voter
turnout
was
prior
to
voter
registration
law
has
been
enacted
and
there
is
the
study
that
shows,
in
the
1880’s
and
1890’s,
voter
participation
was
at
a
much
higher
level
than
voter
participation
is
now.
now
appellee
does
not
argue
that
voter
registration
is
an
impermissible
bar
in
the
franchise,
but,
what
the
appellee
does
asserts
is
the
only
justification
for
this
disfranchisement
is
that
it
does
not
prevent
voter
fraud.
but,
if
that
is
a
significant
enough
price
to
pay
for
prevention
of
fraud
and
if
there
is
no
need
to
have
an
additional
penalty
imposed
and
that
is
the
durational
residency
provisions.
moreover,
there
are
--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
your
honor,
i
think
there
has
been
some
confusion
generated
about
that
and
i
would
like
to
set
the
record
clear.
there
is
no
--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
before
you
can
vote
but
not
before
you
can
register.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
yes
sir.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
your
honor,
there
is
no
discrimination
in
that.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
they
are
also,
if
please
your
honor,
they
are
also
not
discriminatory.
they
apply
equally
to
long
time
residents
and
to
new
residents
a
lot.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
no,
i
think
that
would
be
a
different
case,
your
honor.
it
would
have
to
be
analyzed
under
different
constitutional
theory.
of
course,
it
would
be
applicable
to
new
residents
and
old
residents.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
or,
it
discriminates
against
all
those
who
have
not
attempted
to
register
at
that
point.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
yes
sir,
to
that
extent,
it
does
discriminate
against
him.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
to
that
extent,
yes
sir,
it
is.
mr.
roberts,
in
his
argument,
mentioned
the
concepts
of
line
drawing
and
whether
this
was
an
appropriate
judicial
function.
in
this
case,
the
district
court
did
not
attempt
to
draw
a
line
as
to
a
permissible
duration
of
residency
period.
it
said
that
this
was
an
impermissible
--
in
position
regardless
of
how
long
the
line
was
provided
that
discriminated
in
the
way
that
we
were
talking
about
it,
mr.
justice
stewart.
as
far
as
colonization
argument
is
concerned,
the
state
protects
its
interest
against
fraud
in
several
ways
as
far
in
the
criminal
penalties.
there
is
a
specific
provision
of
the
tennessee
code
section
2-2209
which
makes
the
colonization
a
criminal
penalty,
a
felony
and
poses
a
minimum
term
of
two
years
and
a
maximum
term
of
five
years
for
bringing
voters
from
out
of
state.
there
are
similar
provisions.
tennessee
code
2-1614,
makes
it
a
felony
to
vote
when
note
legally
entitled
and
there
are
other
provisions
in
the
tennessee
code
which
make
it
a
misdemeanor
to
vote
when
note
legally
entitled
to
vote.
moreover,
there
are
the
possibilities
of
purchase,
as
mr.
roberts
mentions,
is
another
way
of
assuring
of
this
interest
that
the
state
has
in
maintaining
the
purity
of
the
election.
also,
tennessee
provides
for
a
challenge
system
at
the
polls
for
people
who
are
not
bona
fide
residents.
this
is
another
way
that
the
state’s
interest
can
be
protected
in
this
way.
in
short,
these
durational
residency
requirements
had
nothing
in
a
significant
way
towards
improving
the
states
purity
of
the
election
system.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
your
honor,
i
think
candidly,
pope
against
williams
--
the
reasoning
in
pope
against
williams
would
have
to
be
overruled
in
this
case.
but,
i
think
that
there
are
certain
factual
distinctions
in
pope
against
williams
that
are
germane.
first
in
pope,
mr.
pope
himself
--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
your
honor,
the
reasoning
of
that
case,
i
think,
is
no
longer
applicable
in
this
case.
i
believe,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
there
are
certain
factual
distinctions
which
also
help
distinguish
the
case.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
i
think
your
honor,
despite
the
factual
distinctions,
candidly,
it
must
be
overruled.
i
was
just
pointing
out
that
there
are
factual
distinctions.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
so.
but,
i
beg
your
indulgence,
i
think
that
the
factual
distinction
is
worth
at
least
mentioning
at
this
point.
mr.
pope
was
a
resident
of
the
state
of
maryland
for
beyond
--
for
more
than
the
duration
of
residency
provision.
he
was
a
resident
for
more
than
a
year.
and,
what
he
was
challenging
was
the
specific
statute
that
required
him
to
state
his
intent
to
become
a
resident
one
year
in
advance.
i
just
think
that
factual
distinction
is
worth
making
at
this
point.
the
state,
in
its
brief,
has
also
asserted
another
interest
and
this
is
a
knowledgeability,
learning
about
the
local
community.
i
think
that
the
point
that
i
raised
before
about
the
domicile
requirement
is
worth
mentioning
here.
there
is
no
requirement,
for
example,
in
tennessee
that
you
physically
be
present
in
the
state
during
the
period
of
this
duration
of
residency.
there
is
no
requirement
that
you
physically
reside
and
just
that
you
establish
your
intent
to
remain
definitely
and
set
up
the
indicia
of
domicile.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
no
sir.
that
is
a
slip
on
my
part.
the
tennessee
courts
have
defined
them
as
the
same.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
yes
sir.
tennessee
is
arguing
that
this
one-year
and
the
three-month
period
is
necessary
for
becoming
knowledgeable
about
the
candidates.
i
think
it
is
interesting
to
note
in
disregard,
sir,
that
the
figures
that
amicus
curiae
brought
to
their
common
cause
in
the
case.
and,
i
think
it
is
recognized
that
the
california
case
in
striking
down
its
durational
residency
noted
that
the
campaigns
typically
now
are
conducted
through
the
media,
and
the
data
of
the
common
cause
show
that
within
the
last
30
days,
candidates
spent
from
between
70%
to
85%
of
their
dollars
for
advertising
within
this
last
30-day
period.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
the
data
did
not
show
--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
sir,
the
data
did
not
show
--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
i
am
not
sure
that
i
understand
your
honor’s
point?
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
as
far
as
ascertaining
the
developing
factors
behind
the
bond
issue,
again,
i
think
that
there
is
no
indication
why
a
long
time
resident
is
necessarily
more
knowledgeable
about
the
fact
that
is
involved
than
someone
who
is
a
new
resident
although
i
do
not
have
any
figures
about
the
advertising
expenditures.
in
sum,
the
state
has
not
shown
its
interest
in
this
case;
it
is
compelling
that
the
durational
residency
requirements
are
required
to
prevent
fraud
or
to
ensure
knowledgeability.
the
case
falls
comfortably
within
the
rationale
that
this
court
has
articulated
in
the
kramer
case
and
within
the
shapiro
against
thompson
case
as
far
as
interstate
travel
is
concerned.
both
of
those
fundamental
rights
are
infringed
in
this
case.
and
therefore,
the
strict
standard
of
review
is
triggered.
under
the
strict
standard
of
review,
the
state
does
not
make
its
burden
of
showing
that
its
interests
are
compelling.
thank
you.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
is
important
to
understand
that
the
first
measure
that
this
case
does
not
involve
the
question
of
residency.
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
that
i
am
a
bona
fide
resident
of
the
state.
the
state
has
conceded
this
throughout
and
the
district
court
found
this
as
a
fact.
there
is
no
question
that
i
meet
the
standards
of
domicile
that
tennessee
imposes
as
its
standard
residence.
so,
the
state’s
argument
entirely
has
been
pitched
to
the
fact
that
there
is
a
question
of
residency
here.
this
is
not
a
question
of
residency.
this
is
a
question
of
an
additional
separate
factor
and
that
is
a
calendar
waiting
period
beyond
the
bona
fide
residency
criteria.
there
is
currently
in
tennessee
--
the
law
revision
commission
of
tennessee
is
currently
under
a
mandate
of
the
legislature
to
revise
the
election
code.
and
a
specific
section
of
that
tentative
draft
of
the
revision
goes
to
the
question
of
defining
bona
fide
residents.
tennessee
is
now
planning
to
adapt
the
standards
of
new
mexico
setting
out
several
indicia
in
criteria
of
determining
bona
fide
residents.
duration
of
residence
is
a
separate
category;
it
is
not
within
one
of
these
factors.
so,
i
just
want
to
make
that
perfectly
clear
at
the
outset.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
mr.
justice
stewart,
there
are
several
points
that
i
can
make
a
response
to
that.
first,
there
is
a
30-day
cutoff
period
for
registration.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
if
a
person
comes
in
to
the
state
of
tennessee
and
establishes
its
domicile,
according
to
the
relevant
tennessee
standards,
you
would
look
at
whether
he
has
become
a
domicile
for
tax
purpose,
you
would
look
at
whether
he
becomes
a
domicile
for
purposes
of
his
driver’s
license,
his
automobile
registration
and
so
forth.
if
he
meets
those
criteria,
either
separate
independent
criteria
that
the
election
commission
and
the
county
registrars
are
entitled
to
investigate.
if
after
their
investigation
at
the
time
of
registration,
it
is
their
conclusion
that
a
new
resident
is
a
bona
fide
resident,
then,
it
is
my
contention
that
there
is
a
discrimination
that
this
court
must
then
review
under
the
compelling
interest
standards.
just
showing
the
discrimination,
your
honor,
is
not
the
answer
to
a
constitutional
question.
at
that
point,
it
triggers
a
strict
constitutional
standard
of
review
and
then
we
must
go
into
the
policy
questions
that
the
state
articulates
to
support
this
discrimination.
so,
my
answer
to
your
question
then
is,
yes,
it
does
trigger
strict
review
and
know
that
the
state
does
not
meet
-
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
yes
sir,
under
those
circumstances
unless
the
state
can
show
a
compelling
reason
to
discriminate
against
this
bona
fide
resident,
it
is
the
constitutional
obligation
of
the
state
to
allow
him
to
vote.
and
there
are
other
classes
of
people
perhaps
in
certain
situations
that
may
be
able
to
--
the
state
may
be
able
to
discriminate
against
as
far
as
the
franchise
is
concerned.
for
example,
many
states
discriminate
against
felons
who
have
already
been
convicted,
and
even
though
they
are
bona
fide
residents,
they
may
be
eliminated
from
the
franchise.
but,
that
is
not
the
case
here,
your
honor.
these
are
not
a
class
of
insane
committed
people
or
felons,
these
are
qualified
voters
in
every
other
respect
except
as
far
as
durational
residence
are
concerned.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
yes,
your
honor;
that
is
correct.
under
existing
tennessee
law,
to
take
your
hypothetical
a
step
further,
if
a
person
were
to
move
to
the
state
--
suppose
someone
in
my
situation
was
is
an
academic.
he
moved
to
the
state,
buy
a
house
and
then
go
on
a
sabbatical
leave
for
the
first
year
of
his
tenure
out
of
a
university,
for
example.
he
never
appeared
in
the
state;
he
never
have
anything
to
do
whatsoever
with
the
politics
of
the
state
or
go
to
rush
ro
go
anywhere
and
come
back
one
year
later
precisely
having
no
contact
whatsoever
with
the
state
and
he
would
be
allowed
to
vote
because
he
would
be
a
domiciliary.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
well,
that
specifically
the
--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
i
believe
your
honor
that
would
be
covered
by
the
most
recent
twenty
sixth
amendment
which
stipulates
18
years
old
for
all
elections.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
well,
i
think
it
would
be
specifically
barred
by
the
twenty
sixth
amendment
from
doing
that.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
my
understanding
is
that
the
twenty
sixth
amendment
covers
both,
your
honor.
this
court’s
opinion
in
united
states
against
arizona
or
oregon
against
mitchell
covered,
restricted
only
to
federal
elections,
but,
the
twenty
sixth
amendment
specifically
covers
all
elections.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
under
this
court’s
opinion
in
oregon
against
mitchell,
i
think
it
certainly
could.
it
would
face
the
penalty
however,
your
honor,
under
section
2
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
establishes
a
21-year-old
age
requirement.
it
would
then
lose
the
aliquot
share
if
its
representation
in
congress.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
yes,
your
honor;
that
is
right.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
no,
your
honor,
justice
blackmun.
the
30-day
provision
is
not
discriminatory.
this
applies
equally
to
all
residents
of
the
state.
the
only
issue
under
attack
here
is
the
discriminatory
aspect.
so
there
is
no
--
there
is
an
administrative
period
that
the
state
has
said
is
necessary
to
prepare
voter
list
and
do
other
administrative
matters
prior
to
an
election.
it
was
this
30-day
period
by
the
way
that
the
district
court
relied
upon
to
deny
the
preliminary
injunction
in
this
case.
the
hearing
occurred
on
july
the
30th
in
the
district
court
and
the
primary
election
was
set
for
august
the
6th,
it
was
only
one
week
later.
and,
the
court
refused
to
interfere
not
because
it
said
the
three-month
period
was
reasonable
but
because
they
thought
it
would
be
judicially
improper.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
provided
that
you
are
within
the
30-day
--
provided
the
registration
books
were
open
which
only
occurs
more
than
30
days
before
the
election.
what
i
am
--
mr.
justice
blackmun,
the
position
that
the
appellee
is
taking
is
that
new
residents
must
be
permitted
to
register
under
the
same
standards
and
under
the
same
criteria
as
long
time
residents.
if
a
long
time
resident
happens
to
delay
his
attempt
to
register
beyond
the
30-day
period,
then
he
is
disfranchised
too,
and
we
are
not
asking
for
any
greater
or
special
treatment
for
new
residents.
all
the
appellee
is
seeking
is
that
new
residents
be
treated
the
same
as
long
time
residents.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
not
if
it
is
--
within
that
30-day
period,
no
sir.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
no
sir.
that
remains
after
this
case.
i
think
i
may
point
out
to
the
court
that
that
is
an
obvious
loophole
in
appellee’s
theory.
if
the
state
for
the
example
were
legislatively
to
argue
that
35
or
40
days
were
the
appropriate
period
and
this
would
apply
equally
to
all
new
residents
and
old
residents
alike,
this
would
be,
if
you
will,
a
backdoor
away
of
achieving
some
of
the
same
objectives.
i
think
that
administratively,
this
would
cause
chaos
because
of
the
30-day
period
congress
has
set
in
the
1970
voting
rights
act.
but,
i
think
that
it
is
clear
and
i
think
i
have
made
that
point
in
the
brief
that
this
is
a
potential
loophole
that
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
there
is
permanent
registration
but
they
are
all
provisions
for
purging
if
you
do
not
vote
for
a
certain
number
of
years.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
yes
sir.
at
this
point,
i
think
it
would
be
relevant
to
talk
about
what
the
discrimination
is.
i
have
talked
about
discrimination
between
new
and
old
residents.
well,
the
state
of
tennessee
is
a
homogenous
community
and
nashville,
davidson
county
is
a
homogenous
community
that
is
stable
over
time.
well,
this
flies
in
the
face
of
census
statistics.
americans
are
extremely
mobile
people.
over
the
course
of
a
very
few
years,
the
entire
character
of
a
community
may
change.
communities
are
in
no
sense
stable
in
the
unites
states.
each
year
for
example,
more
than
13
million
people
move
from
one
county
to
another.
and
of
those,
more
than
7
million
move
from
one
state
to
another.
this
represents
an
annual
interstate
migration
almost
the
size
of
the
city
of
new
york.
moreover,
of
those
almost
4,500,000
people
of
voting
age
adults,
who
move
from
one
state
to
another,
are
disfranchised.
in
addition,
census
figures
estimate
that
the
total
disfranchisement
from
these
residency
period
is
5,590,000
people
throughout
the
united
states.
this
is
a
staggering
figure
and
it
represents
about
7.7%
of
the
total
vote
cast
in
the
1968
presidential
election.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
your
honor,
the
7.7
figure?
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
that
was
a
percent
of
the
actual
vote
cast.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
no,
your
honor.
that
does
make
that
assumption.
the
census
refined
that
figure.
in
a
questionnaire
they
asked
people
who
were
potentially
disfranchised,
who
were
not
eligible
to
vote
because
of
these
durational
residency
requirements,
and
census
figure
show
that
3,022,000
of
those
numbers
would
have,
according
to
a
questionnaire,
would
have
participated
in
the
election.
the
figure
is
smaller
when
you
only
look
at
those
who
would
have
participated.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
well,
it
is
possible,
your
honor,
the
amicus
points
out
that
it
might
overstate
the
actual
disfranchisement
of
those
who
would
vote.
however,
i
would
like
to
point
out
in
this
regard,
one
of
the
characteristics
of
the
class
of
new
residents
are
that
they
typically
have
higher
educational
levels.
they
tend
to
have
finished
high
school
more
frequently
than
the
rest
of
the
population
and
if
they
tend
to
have
to
been
at
least
to
some
college
to
a
significant
degree
more
than
the
rest
of
the
population.
there
is
also
evidence
to
show,
your
honor,
that
people
who
have
higher
degrees
of
education
who
typically
find
themselves
in
white
collar
and
professional
occupations
are
tend
to
participate
more
frequently
in
the
election
process.
and
therefore,
i
think
the
figure
is
not
as
overstated
as
it
might
seem
on
its
face.
the
new
residents,
i
think
typically
do
participate
as
a
group
more
because
of
these
characteristics.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
yes,
your
honor.
the
district
court
was
handed
down
on
september
9,
1970,
and
since
that
time,
two
general
elections
and
one
primary
election
have
been
held
in
the
state
of
tennessee.
it
might
be
interesting
to
add
that
tennessee
was
a
major
political
battle
ground
in
1970
where
a
former
senator
gore
was
defeated
by
the
incumbent
senator
brock.
this
was
an
election
of
nationwide
significance.
and
since
this
decision
was
one
of
the
earliest
handed
down
by
the
district
court
involving
durational
residency,
there
was
no
question
that
it
got
widespread
dissemination
among
all
the
neighboring
states
in
tennessee.
and,
there
was
ample
opportunity
with
colonization
of
the
other
fraudulent
devices
of
the
state
it
refers
to,
and
there
was
no
evidence
whatsoever
and
it
was
reported
to
me
of
any
problems
in
this
regards,
to
be
sure
that
the
registrar
of
davidson
county
did
make
the
statement
that
she
would
have
to
ensure
a
bicycle
rack
in
front
of
her
county
courthouse,
but
this
is
the
kind
of
armchair
assertion
that
is
not
backed
up
by
any
data
at
all.
there
was
no
evidence
whatsoever
of
fraud;
there
was
no
data
that
the
state
has
brought
to
bear
on
this
question.
in
discussing
the
constitutional
claim,
it
is
essential
to
look
at
the
alternatives
that
the
state
has
in
order
to
prevent
frauds,
since
we
seem
to
have
focused
on
fraud.
the
voter
registration
system
was
not
--
statewide
voter
registration
did
not
come
in
being
in
tennessee
until
1951.
the
expressed
purpose
of
voter
registration,
as
stated
in
the
statute,
is
to
protect
the
purity
of
the
ballot.
the
district
court
found
this
as
a
fact.
there
is
no
interest
that
the
state
is
protecting
by
duration
of
residency
that
cannot
be
protected
in
determining
bona
fide
residents
at
the
time
of
registration.
there
is
no
additional
protection
that
the
period
of
durational
residency
provides
at
all.
and
the
state
--
just
this
morning
in
fact,
in
discussing
the
need
to
purge
voters
and
so
forth,
does
not
go
to
the
question
of
why
at
the
time
of
registration,
the
state
cannot
make
the
determination
of
bona
fide
residence.
this
is
the
role
of
registration.
in
fact,
there
are
figures
to
indicate
that
the
system
of
voter
registration
itself
has
raised
a
great
obstacle
for
voter
turnout.
voter
turnout
in
the
last
three
presidential
elections
did
not
match
at
all
with
what
voter
turnout
was
prior
to
voter
registration
law
has
been
enacted
and
there
is
the
study
that
shows,
in
the
1880’s
and
1890’s,
voter
participation
was
at
a
much
higher
level
than
voter
participation
is
now.
now
appellee
does
not
argue
that
voter
registration
is
an
impermissible
bar
in
the
franchise,
but,
what
the
appellee
does
asserts
is
the
only
justification
for
this
disfranchisement
is
that
it
does
not
prevent
voter
fraud.
but,
if
that
is
a
significant
enough
price
to
pay
for
prevention
of
fraud
and
if
there
is
no
need
to
have
an
additional
penalty
imposed
and
that
is
the
durational
residency
provisions.
moreover,
there
are
--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
your
honor,
i
think
there
has
been
some
confusion
generated
about
that
and
i
would
like
to
set
the
record
clear.
there
is
no
--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
before
you
can
vote
but
not
before
you
can
register.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
yes
sir.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
your
honor,
there
is
no
discrimination
in
that.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
they
are
also,
if
please
your
honor,
they
are
also
not
discriminatory.
they
apply
equally
to
long
time
residents
and
to
new
residents
a
lot.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
no,
i
think
that
would
be
a
different
case,
your
honor.
it
would
have
to
be
analyzed
under
different
constitutional
theory.
of
course,
it
would
be
applicable
to
new
residents
and
old
residents.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
or,
it
discriminates
against
all
those
who
have
not
attempted
to
register
at
that
point.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
yes
sir,
to
that
extent,
it
does
discriminate
against
him.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
to
that
extent,
yes
sir,
it
is.
mr.
roberts,
in
his
argument,
mentioned
the
concepts
of
line
drawing
and
whether
this
was
an
appropriate
judicial
function.
in
this
case,
the
district
court
did
not
attempt
to
draw
a
line
as
to
a
permissible
duration
of
residency
period.
it
said
that
this
was
an
impermissible
--
in
position
regardless
of
how
long
the
line
was
provided
that
discriminated
in
the
way
that
we
were
talking
about
it,
mr.
justice
stewart.
as
far
as
colonization
argument
is
concerned,
the
state
protects
its
interest
against
fraud
in
several
ways
as
far
in
the
criminal
penalties.
there
is
a
specific
provision
of
the
tennessee
code
section
2-2209
which
makes
the
colonization
a
criminal
penalty,
a
felony
and
poses
a
minimum
term
of
two
years
and
a
maximum
term
of
five
years
for
bringing
voters
from
out
of
state.
there
are
similar
provisions.
tennessee
code
2-1614,
makes
it
a
felony
to
vote
when
note
legally
entitled
and
there
are
other
provisions
in
the
tennessee
code
which
make
it
a
misdemeanor
to
vote
when
note
legally
entitled
to
vote.
moreover,
there
are
the
possibilities
of
purchase,
as
mr.
roberts
mentions,
is
another
way
of
assuring
of
this
interest
that
the
state
has
in
maintaining
the
purity
of
the
election.
also,
tennessee
provides
for
a
challenge
system
at
the
polls
for
people
who
are
not
bona
fide
residents.
this
is
another
way
that
the
state’s
interest
can
be
protected
in
this
way.
in
short,
these
durational
residency
requirements
had
nothing
in
a
significant
way
towards
improving
the
states
purity
of
the
election
system.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
your
honor,
i
think
candidly,
pope
against
williams
--
the
reasoning
in
pope
against
williams
would
have
to
be
overruled
in
this
case.
but,
i
think
that
there
are
certain
factual
distinctions
in
pope
against
williams
that
are
germane.
first
in
pope,
mr.
pope
himself
--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
your
honor,
the
reasoning
of
that
case,
i
think,
is
no
longer
applicable
in
this
case.
i
believe,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
there
are
certain
factual
distinctions
which
also
help
distinguish
the
case.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
i
think
your
honor,
despite
the
factual
distinctions,
candidly,
it
must
be
overruled.
i
was
just
pointing
out
that
there
are
factual
distinctions.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
so.
but,
i
beg
your
indulgence,
i
think
that
the
factual
distinction
is
worth
at
least
mentioning
at
this
point.
mr.
pope
was
a
resident
of
the
state
of
maryland
for
beyond
--
for
more
than
the
duration
of
residency
provision.
he
was
a
resident
for
more
than
a
year.
and,
what
he
was
challenging
was
the
specific
statute
that
required
him
to
state
his
intent
to
become
a
resident
one
year
in
advance.
i
just
think
that
factual
distinction
is
worth
making
at
this
point.
the
state,
in
its
brief,
has
also
asserted
another
interest
and
this
is
a
knowledgeability,
learning
about
the
local
community.
i
think
that
the
point
that
i
raised
before
about
the
domicile
requirement
is
worth
mentioning
here.
there
is
no
requirement,
for
example,
in
tennessee
that
you
physically
be
present
in
the
state
during
the
period
of
this
duration
of
residency.
there
is
no
requirement
that
you
physically
reside
and
just
that
you
establish
your
intent
to
remain
definitely
and
set
up
the
indicia
of
domicile.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
no
sir.
that
is
a
slip
on
my
part.
the
tennessee
courts
have
defined
them
as
the
same.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
yes
sir.
tennessee
is
arguing
that
this
one-year
and
the
three-month
period
is
necessary
for
becoming
knowledgeable
about
the
candidates.
i
think
it
is
interesting
to
note
in
disregard,
sir,
that
the
figures
that
amicus
curiae
brought
to
their
common
cause
in
the
case.
and,
i
think
it
is
recognized
that
the
california
case
in
striking
down
its
durational
residency
noted
that
the
campaigns
typically
now
are
conducted
through
the
media,
and
the
data
of
the
common
cause
show
that
within
the
last
30
days,
candidates
spent
from
between
70%
to
85%
of
their
dollars
for
advertising
within
this
last
30-day
period.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
the
data
did
not
show
--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
sir,
the
data
did
not
show
--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
i
am
not
sure
that
i
understand
your
honor’s
point?
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
as
far
as
ascertaining
the
developing
factors
behind
the
bond
issue,
again,
i
think
that
there
is
no
indication
why
a
long
time
resident
is
necessarily
more
knowledgeable
about
the
fact
that
is
involved
than
someone
who
is
a
new
resident
although
i
do
not
have
any
figures
about
the
advertising
expenditures.
in
sum,
the
state
has
not
shown
its
interest
in
this
case;
it
is
compelling
that
the
durational
residency
requirements
are
required
to
prevent
fraud
or
to
ensure
knowledgeability.
the
case
falls
comfortably
within
the
rationale
that
this
court
has
articulated
in
the
kramer
case
and
within
the
shapiro
against
thompson
case
as
far
as
interstate
travel
is
concerned.
both
of
those
fundamental
rights
are
infringed
in
this
case.
and
therefore,
the
strict
standard
of
review
is
triggered.
under
the
strict
standard
of
review,
the
state
does
not
make
its
burden
of
showing
that
its
interests
are
compelling.
thank
you.
