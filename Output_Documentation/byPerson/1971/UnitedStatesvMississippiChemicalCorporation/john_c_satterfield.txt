mr.
john
c.
satterfield
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
we
have
a
very
basic
difference
of
opinion
with
the
government
in
its
position.
in
order
for
the
government
to
prevail
as
has
been
indicated
by
counsel,
they
must
establish
this
proposition
which
appeared
on
page
11
of
their
brief
15
is
taken
to
all
grand
position
on
the
case,
neither
the
fact
that
respondents
are
required
to
invest
in
class
c
stock
in
connection
with
their
loans.
now
the
limitations
on
transferability
of
the
stock
could
convert
its
cost
into
a
deductible
expense.
if
it
otherwise
would
qualify
as
an
income-producing
asset
providing
benefits
in
50
years.
our
position
is
and
i
will
demonstrate
that
this
is
not
an
income-producing
asset,
that
in
fact
it
has
only
a
nominal
value
or
as
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
held
while
it
is
not
worthless
using
the
words
of
that
court,
it
was
without
an
appreciable
market
value
and
had
only
a
nominal
value.
as
said
again
by
that
court,
class
c
stock
shares
are
of
no
appreciable
value
to
the
taxpayer.
as
said
further
in
that
court,
the
class
c
shares
had
no
fair
market
value
and
no
more
than
a
nominal
value
and
no
value
to
the
taxpayers
“in
the
usual
sense.”
now,
reference
had
been
made
by
counsel
both
in
the
brief
and
in
argument,
taking
the
position
that
the
patronage
refund
is
credited
upon
the
books
as
class
c
stock
and
allocated
surplus
credited
upon
the
books
as
a
class
c
stock,
were
credited
upon
and
earned
by
the
amount
paid
as
interest
override
or
for
purchase
of
so-called
of
class
c
stock.
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
is
wholly
without
any
foundation
and
the
statute
and
the
regulations,
in
law
or
in
fact.
the
statute
provides
in
section
1134
(g),
all
patronage
refund
shall
be
paid
in
proportion
the
amount
of
interest
earned
on
the
loans
of
each
borrower
bears
to
the
total
interest
earned
on
the
loans
of
all
borrowers
during
the
year.
it
has
no
relationship
to
the
free
interest
made
at
the
end
of
the
year,
qualify
c
stock
to
with
one
interest,
the
amount
paid
as
interest
override
on
the
class
c
stock
column,
another
entry
on
the
patronage
refund
as
class
c
stock
on
the
column,
another
entry
as
allocated
surplus
on
the
class
c
stock
column.
and
the
regulation
70
part
162
which
appear
on
page
65
of
the
brief
as
an
appendix
of
the
government,
allocation
shall
be
made
in
what?
they
are
wholly
unrelated
to
this,
it
is
just
override
itself.
allocation
shall
be
made
in
proportion
that
the
amount
of
interest
accrued
on
the
loans
of
each
borrower
bears
to
the
total
interest
accrued
on
the
loans
of
all
borrowers
during
the
fiscal
year
and
shall
be
recorded
as
allocations
at
the
end
of
the
fiscal
year.
it
is
impossible
to
conclude
that
the
interest
made
as
patronage
refunds,
allocations
of
surplus
are
returns
upon
the
interest
made
at
the
end
of
the
year
of
the
interest
override
amount
on
the
so-called
class
c
stock.
let
us
take
an
illustration
as
to
what
this
really
means.
these
class
c
stocks
are
in
either
in
that
year
or
in
subsequent
years
any
income.
cooperative
“a”
has
accumulated
a
$150,000.00
in
par
or
face
value
of
class
c
stock.
cooperative
“b”
has
just
come
in
and
bought
one
qualifying
share
of
class
c
stock
on
the
basis
of
$100.00.
each
borrows
from
the
new
orleans
bank
for
cooperatives
that
is
the
same
amount
of
money,
their
loans
are
identical
now.
the
cooperative
with
$150,000.00
in
par
value
of
class
c
stock,
the
cooperative
with
the
$100.00
par
value
of
class
c
stock
received
the
identical
amount
of
patronage
refund,
the
identical
amount
of
allocated
surplus,
the
same
being
related
not
to
class
c
stock
or
to
interest
override.
it
is
related
to
the
interest
paid
upon
the
loan
for
the
year.
that
is
true
both
as
to
the
first
year
and
as
to
every
subsequent
every
year.
so
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
impossible
that
this
can
be
attributed
to
it.
now,
this
has
been
recognized
by
the
government
in
this
case,
in
the
m.f.a
case
and
in
other
cases.
in
this
case,
that
was
included
in
the
district
court
an
attempt
to
recover
patronage
refund.
the
basis
being
that
the
patronage
refund
had
a
value
which
was
a
taxable
value
for
basis
of
$100.00
per
share.
the
district
court
held
against
the
government
on
that.
in
the
court
of
appeals
the
government
abandoned
that
position.
it
did
not
appeal
from
the
district
court
to
the
court
of
appeals.
it
has
not
appealed
to
this
court.
in
the
m.f.a.
case,
come
to
eighth
circuit,
it
was
not
even
involved
in
the
district
court
although
it
is
one
of
the
briefs
it
was
indicated
that
it
might
have
been
involved.
but
in
the
–-
at
the
court
of
appeals
level,
it
was
not
urged
and
now
on
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
now
pending.
it
is
not
urged.
and
why
is
that?
and
mind
you,
this
is
all
the
same
class
c
stock.
no
difference
on
one
class
c
and
another
class
c,
all
interest
as
suggested
by
indicated
on
the
books.
now
why
is
it
that
we
are
not
asked
to
pay
tax
on
the
class
c
stock
on
the
second
column
under
the
heading
patronage
refund?
class
c
was
made
for
class
c
stock
under
the
heading
allocated
surplus
but
only
those
interests
may
at
the
same
time
at
the
end
of
the
year
under
first
column
class
c
stock
said
to
be
resulting
from
the
payment
of
interest
overriding
it.
here
is
the
reason.
in
rome
and
in
cafter,
it
was
hereby
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
fourth
circuit
and
in
regulation,
treasury
regulation
161-5-b-123
and
124,
the
irs
had
taken
the
position
that
while
this
type
of
certificate
or
stock
is
issued
and
is
received
as
patronage
refund,
the
market
value
shall
be
taxed
to
the
patriot
at
the
time
of
the
receipt
and
“the
regulation,”
this
is
taken
all
from
those
two
decisions,
“however,
to
the
parts
of
this
subdivision,
any
document
which
is
payable
only
in
the
discretion
of
a
cooperative
association,
shall
be
considered
not
to
have
any
fair
market
value
unless
it
is
clearly
established
to
the
contract.”
therefore,
this
class
c
stock
while
that
being
1,
2,
or
third
column
does
not
have
market
value
unless
it
is
clearly
established
as
contrary
and
this
record,
as
we
have
shown
in
our
briefs,
as
were
found
by
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
as
was
found
by
the
district
court,
not
only
was
not
clearly
shown
to
have
value
or
market
value
it
was
clearly
shown
to
have
only
a
nominal
value.
that
is
a
matter
of
discretion.
this
illustration
of
the
compensating
balance
is
holding
applicable.
if
there
is
a
compensating
balance,
it
is
repayable
when
the
loan
is
repaid
as
kept
by
loan
value
on
that.
it
serves
money.
what
if
it
does
not
have
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
supplemental
brief?
if
it
is
a
$10,000.00
deal
you
have
a
compensation
of
about
$1,000.00,
you
save
for
about
$9,000.00.
say
upon
8%
you
pay
8.9%
but
the
number
of
dollars
is
the
same.
you
pay
$800.00
interest
on
a
$10,000.00
loan
but
you
deposit
$1,000.00
you
actually
get
$9,000.00.
hence,
you
are
paying
8.9%
and
you
have
a
deduction
for
the
full
$800.00
paid
and
you
do
not
ask
for
it
or
receive
anymore.
but
that
is
your
money,
it
comes
back
to
you
and
you
receive
it.
now
here,
if
or
when,
or
how
under
what
circumstances,
class
c
stock
may
be
revolved
is
within
discretion
of
three
borrowers.
the
market
says
it
has
recommendations
to
original
farm
credit
administration.
there
are
important
credit
administration
recommendations
to
the
farm
credit
administration
within
all
three
discretions
not
to
be
exercised
in
order
for
it
to
be
repaid.
now,
not
only
that
but
there
has
been
some
inadvertent
errors
or
omissions
in
the
brief
which
has
been
filed
by
the
government
in
this
case.
i
think
perhaps
in
receiving
advice
from
the
farm
credit
administration
their
telephone
–-
it
is
just
hard
for
telephone
too
soon.
for
instance,
there
is
a
statement
made
is
not
in
the
record,
no
evidences
are
supplied
whatsoever
it
is
not
--
but
the
statement
is
made
that
they
have
been
advised
by
the
administration,
farm
credit
administration,
this
is
note
number
26
on
page
21
that
all
the
a
stock
in
your
bank
cooperative
have
been
repaid.
but,
and
this
is
what
(inaudible)
assumes,
but
what
actually
happen
was
the
clear
implication,
is
it
was
repaid
by
the
revolving
of
c
stock.
the
fact
is
bank
of
cooperatives,
borrowed
several
millions
of
dollars
on
open
market
in
order
to
pay
it
off
and
now
the
effect
of
it
rather
hastening
the
repayment
of
c
stock
as
a
financial
matter,
it
means
it
would
be
a
longer
period
time
before
the
c
stock
can
be
revolved
because
they
are
paying
a
higher
interest
and
no
matter
they
borrowed
the
a
stock
then
they
were
paying
returns
to
the
government
on
the
a
stock.
now,
it
is
a
fact
that
by
borrowing
that
money,
inviting
themselves
by
that
additional
interest
and
inviting
themselves
with
taxes
in
all
its
exempt,
they
have
reduced
their
financial
ability
to
repay
c
stock.
but
they
have
removed
the
legal
inhibition
which
existed
because
they
could
not
revolve
c
stock
as
long
as
a
was
outstanding,
but
that
is
a
situation
which
has
not
improved
the
possibility
of
the
revolving
of
the
c
stock.
and
it
is
to
that,
now,
i
mentioned
only
in
facing
another
time
in
which
(inaudible)
note
number
16
–-
of
the
note,
i
am
sorry,
on
page
7,
this
is
note
on
page
21.
some
reference
is
made
to
the
possibility
that
if
this
court
holds
this
–
the
taxable
income
there
might
be
a
$100
million
less
lending
power
for
the
banks
for
cooperative.
i
say
that
it
is
kind
of
a
point
to
assume,
but
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
it
should
occur
that
on
the
other
side
of
the
coin
that
the
banks,
it
should
be
held
this
is
interest
income
to
the
bank.
the
statute
having
additional
interest
income
or
margin,
the
statute
requires
that
that
be
paid
to
their
patron.
it
is
not
taxable
income.
it
increases
the
amount
of
patronage
refund
which
is
deductible
from
the
bank
and
from
their
taxable
sources.
in
addition
to
that,
depending
on
the
discretion
of
the
bank
and
they
have
full
discretion,
it
would
not
affect
their
lending
power
in
any
way.
if
they,
in
their
discretion
simply
said
we
would
simply
delay
the
revolving
of
the
earliest
c
stock
because
we
have
a
million
dollars
less
or
$500,000.00
less
since
this
went
out
in
patronage
as
additional
margins.
therefore
there
would
be
no
burden
of
whatever
upon
the
banks
if
that
occurs.
now,
may
i
point
out
to
the
court
a
few
things,
especially
in
connection
with
this
lincoln
case?
mr.
john
c.
satterfield
may
it
please
the
court,
the
answer
is
yes.
in
that
instance
the
$1,000.00
is
placed
in
the
account.
the
actual
$1,000.00
is
repayable
when
the
loan
is
repaid.
it
is
true
that
the
borrower
received
$9,000.00
rather
a
net
of
$9,000.00,
rather
a
net
of
$10,000.00
as
a
loan.
the
only
result
is
he
paying
a
higher
rate
of
interest
because
if
he
pays
8%
on
$10,000.00
that
amounts
to
8.9%
on
a
$9,000.00
and
there,
there
is
no
similarity
to
this
situation
at
all
because
it
is
the
money
of
the
borrower.
it
is
repayable
not
in
possible
discretion
depending
on
as
i
have
listed
in
the
brief
at
11
contingencies
it
may
or
may
not
have,
but
it
is
fund.
it
is
money
there
belonging
to
the
borrower.
therefore
there
is
no
parallel
to
this
case
whatsoever.
it
is
simply
in
that
case
you
see
not
that
there
is
a
lack
by
the
taxpayer
of
claiming
what
he
might
have
earned
by
the
use
of
$1,000.00.
he
has
said
he
required
to
pay
a
higher
rate
of
interest
because
it
gets
the
$9,000.00
loan
and
he
spent
8.9%
interest
by
paying
the
same
interest
that
he
would
have
contracted
upon
$10,000.00,
otherwise
$8,00.00
is
all
the
interest
what
he
paid
on
$10,000.00
loan
on
8%.
if
he
pays
$800.00
a
year
on
a
$9,000.00
loan,
he
pays
8.9%
and
he
has
the
right
to
deduct
the
full
$800.00.
he
does
not
deduct
more,
he
does
not
deduct
less.
he
deducts
what
he
pays.
mr.
john
c.
satterfield
well
as
--
if
you
are
saying
that
in
your
case,
the
point
that
you
have
plenty
of
class
you
divide
it
with
class
c
stock
and
get
to
the
certificate,
you
say
there
is
no
one
tell
you
at
all?
mr.
john
c.
satterfield
well,
has
no
value,
it
had
only
a
number
of
that.
mr.
john
c.
satterfield
right.
and
it
remains
as
in
time
instead
of
a
loan;
it
is
money
belonging
to
the
party
involved,
contingencies
as
to
possible
repayment
in
28.1
years
as
the
evidence
shown
in
this
case
or
31
years
in
penn
yan
case
so
some
other
indefinite
period
of
years
does
not
exist.
it
is
his
money,
like
in
lincoln
case.
now
in
lincoln,
as
the
court
will
remember,
there
was
a
secondary
result.
now
this
secondary
reserve
in
lincoln,
the
money
was
deposited.
now,
under
the
statute
there,
there
were
the
mandatory
provisions
as
the
court
said
in
discussing
the
effect,
three
instances
in
which
the
party
would
get
the
money
back
and
was
required
to
be
paid
the
money
back
by
the
statute,
said
the
court
in
that
case
–-
this
court
on
that
case.
the
prospective
refund
indicates
an
in
cash
effect
of
institution
of
pro-rata
share
upon
culmination
of
its
insured
status
or
upon
receivership
or
liquidation,
or
when
the
primary
reserve
alone
reaches
suspension
level
was
required
to
be
made
by
the
statute.
in
other
words,
if
the
primary
reserve
got
big
enough
the
guy
got
back
what
he
put
in
the
secondary
reserve.
now
in
addition
to
that,
in
that
statute,
there
was
income
producing
as
a
matter
of
fact
because
the
statute
required
that
the
home
loan
of
the
insurance
company
(hlic)
pay
interest
upon
the
secondary
reserve
amounts
in
the
identical
percentages
that
they
received
from
their
obligations
held
by
them
with
the
unites
states
government,
and
in
the
brief,
filed
by
government
in
that
case
it
was
said
without
dispute
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
time
involved
in
this
particular
case
that
there
was
earned
from
3.15
to
4.43%
annually
upon
the
secondary
reserve.
that
was
always
there.
it
was
mandated
to
be
returned
under
any
or
all
circumstances
which
might
occur.
whereas
in
this
case,
this
credit
entered
upon
the
books
is
(1)
as
to
which
the
fund
may
or
may
not
be
repaid.
there
is
quite
a
difference
between
a
legal
right
to
receive
by
a
depositing
case
with
interest
guaranteed
by
the
statute
or
a
right
to
receive
back
a
compensating
deposit
with
the
bank
with
or
without
interest.
as
compared
to
a
situation
in
which
we
have
this.
now,
what
is
this
interest
override?
the
statute
itself
is
clear.
the
statute
says
in
26
u.s.c.
1134
(d)
uses
the
words
that
the
borrower
shall
be
required
to
invest
quarterly
in
class
c
stock
and
of
course
as
we
said
in
lincoln,
so
the
statutory
label
of
prepayment
and
advance
premium
contains
404
(d)
are
not
controlled.
but
as
you
call
it,
the
purchase
of
class
c
stock
is
not
controlled.
the
fact
that
was
made
is
controlled.
it
comes
on
to
the
old
principle
recognized
by
this
court
since
the
beginning
of
taxation.
if
the
substance
is
not
to
fall
the
incisive
substance,
the
incisive
facts
as
distinguished
from
the
form
that
are
governing
all
tax
matters.
now,
how
about
these
amounts?
these
amounts
required
to
be
paid
which
are
here
involved
as
the
only,
the
first
of
the
three
kinds
about
this
stock,
that
is
so
called
interest
override,
an
amount
equal
to
not
less
than
10
not
more
than
15%
of
what,
i
am
reading
it
from
the
statute
now,
“of
the
amount
of
interest
payable
by
it
to
the
bank
during
the
calendar
quarter,
8%
of
the
interest
thus
is
required
to
be
paid.”
now,
this
is
right
significant
sentence
seems
to
me,
this
is
coming
from
the
statute,
“payments
for
such
stock
shall
be
made
quarterly
and
when
the
regular
interest
payments
of
the
borrower
are
payable.”
there
is
no
question
about
the
regulating
an
interest
fall.
within
regular
interest
of
6%
at
this
time,
period
of
time,
let
me
spend
remove
we
are
now
paying
7
or
8
regular
interest,
but
we
pay
15%
more
upon
the
regular
interest.
therefore,
we
do
have
a
valid
question,
a
matter
of
the
payment
of
funds
for
what
part?
now,
let
us
look
at
that
just
a
minute.
why
was
it
paid?
that
is
the
real
question.
why
was
these
amounts
paid?
were
they
paid
as
investment?
are
we
paying
a
$100.00
a
share
for
the
interest
on
the
books
so
called
class
c
stock
as
an
investment
because
we
expected
that
it
might
be
returned
if
the
discretion
was
so
exercised
in
20.4
years
or
21.6
years
without
interest,
without
dividends,
without
any
earning?
well,
of
course
not.
the
incisive
practicality
affects
session
required
that
it
be
determined.
well,
this
taxpayer
paid
the
$99.00
difference
between
the
$100.00
so
called
par
and
the
nominal
value
found
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
district
court
for
the
use
of
money
or
to
buy
an
investment
and
i
do
no
think
there
is
any
businessman
in
the
united
states
would
be
foolish
enough
to
pay
a
$100.00
to
buy
the
so-called
class
c
stock
which
may
in
the
discretion
of
free
bodies,
being
paid
by
some
unknown
date
if
congress
does
not
change
at
all
and
if
the
bank
does
not
decide
to
go
ahead
and
pay
taxes
refund
in
some
other
matter.
mr.
john
c.
satterfield
yes,
i
do.
mr.
john
c.
satterfield
may
it
please
the
court,
our
position
is
this,
that
as
is
set
forth
in
the
statute
itself,
these
preference
dividends
or
refunds
and
allocated
surplus
are
a
participation
in
the
margin
of
profits
of
the
bank
that
they
are
arising
from
the
payment
of
the
--
as
the
statutory
regular
interest.
now,
this
15%
is
at
the
end
of
year,
the
statute
so
provides
and
so
does
70.142
of
the
regulation.
so
the
interest
upon
which
the
government
now
says,
we
receive
patronage
refunds
or
receive
allocated
surplus,
did
not
even
exist
during
the
year.
they
will
make
at
the
end
of
the
year
at
the
same
time
that
the
patronage
refund
and
allocated
surplus
were
credited
for
one
reason.
mr.
john
c.
satterfield
that
actually
has
a
result
if
and
when
it
is
repaid
20
to
31
to
40
years
later
to
the
extent
of
the
value
of
the
money
in
1958
which
may
be
repaid
by
1981.
to
that
extent,
it
will
reduce
the
cost
of
the
regular
interest
and
also
the
interest
override
which
have
added
to
the
regular
interest.
it
would
reduce
to
cost
to
the
extent
of
its
value
by
$1.00
share.
mr.
john
c.
satterfield
yes
sir,
we
believe
and
it
is
our
position
that
if
ever
we
are
repaid,
it
would
be
ordinary
income,
taxable
as
ordinary
income
to
the
borrower
and
that
may
be
28
years
or
31
years
from
now.
mr.
john
c.
satterfield
now,
that
is
true.
it
is
merely
a
possibility
and
possibilities
are
not
taxed
and
we
have
pointed
out
on
page
7
of
our
brief
and
further
on
page
9
of
our
brief,
eleven
contingencies
upon
which
depends
the
amount
paid
and
on
page
9
we
pointed
out
seven
contingencies
or
discretions
which
has
to
be
exercised
if
it
ever
easily
paid.
so
seven
and
11,
18
different
elements
that
are
into
whether
or
not
we
will
ever
see
the
inchoate
income
which
might
come
as
a
result
of
the
interest
which
arose
from
actually
not
the
entry
of
the
first
column
at
the
end
of
the
year.
so
for
interest
over,
whatever
it
may
be
called
class-c
stock,
but
from
the
payment
of
the
regular
interest
quarterly
which
were
paid.
the
interests
of
this
under
the
regulations
are
made
only
at
the
end
of
the
year.
mr.
john
c.
satterfield
to
this
extent
mr.
justice
powell,
the
class
c
stock
is
subject
to
a
lien
securing
any
borrowing
by
the
borrower,
a
loan
by
the
borrower
then
(inaudible),
but
the
record
shows
on
page
242
and
246,
the
testimony
of
the
president
of
the
bank
un-contradicted
this
that
under
no
circumstances
is
it
ever
given
any
collateral
value.
he
testified
that
if
an
application
is
made
for
a
loan
and
if
the
balance
sheet
shows
class
c
stock
by
$100,000.00,
they
strike
that
out
in
arriving
at
the
valuation
or
the
security
given.
it
is
never
used
as
security
to
obtain
a
loan.
it
is
technically
liable
to
a
lien
of
the
repayment
below.
the
bank
has
never
sold
a
single
share
of
class
c
stock
all
of
them
under
compulsion
of
the
statute.
the
testimony
shows
that
unlike
the
situation
in
m.f.a.,
that
there
has
never
been
a
sale
from
one
cooperative
to
the
other
of
new
cooperative
stock,
the
situation
being
fine
severe
or
different.
mr.
john
c.
satterfield
yes,
there
have
been
failing
borrowers.
mr.
john
c.
satterfield
if
in
those
instances
there
was
the
class
c
balance,
they
would
credit
up
to
the
balance
who
would
not
pay
one
nickel
on
what
was
left
over?
mr.
john
c.
satterfield
only
to
the
extent
that
it
was
required
to
balance
all
of
the
loan
if
it
was
sufficient.
mr.
john
c.
satterfield
if
it
was
required
to
pay
the
balance,
otherwise
not.
in
other
words
--
mr.
john
c.
satterfield
oh
well
--
mr.
john
c.
satterfield
mr.
justice
in
the
instance,
i
am
talking
about
that,
it
have
to
be
no
because
in
that
instances
that
were
in
the
record,
there
was
an
insolvency.
there
was
class
c
stock
which
would
balance
all
of
what
was
left
and
additional
class
c
stock.
all
“owned
by
the
borrower”
which
was
not
balanced
of.
now,
this
additional
class
c
stock
“own
by
the
borrower”
was
canceled.
he
got
no
money.
mr.
john
c.
satterfield
yes,
if
there
was
an
opportunity.
mr.
john
c.
satterfield
to
the
extent
that
it
might
be
--
mr.
john
c.
satterfield
right,
in
other
words,
it
was
used
to
balance
to
the
extent
it
was
available.
well,
may
it
please
the
court
we
like
to
close
in
pointing
out
this
fact.
and
that
is
that
the
real
and
only
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
these
payments
of
15%
of
the
regular
interest
were
made
for
the
use
of
money
because
of
the
need
of
use
of
money
in
order
to
obtain
unused
money.
it
was
not
made
as
an
investment
to
obtain
a
capital
income-producing
asset.
i
concede
only
one
answer.
they
were
made
under
compulsion
of
statute.
they
were
made
in
order
to
obtain
and
retain
the
loan.
may
i
call
the
attention
of
the
fact
this
intrinsic
value
argument
has
no
substance
whatever.
this,
unlike
the
home
loan
bank
situation
in
(inaudible),
one
share,
the
qualifying
share
a
$100.00
are
paid
par
value,
part
of
the
constraint
they
issued
the
$100.00
when
they
got
the
fair
share
qualifying
into
the
said
loan.
but
as
they
received
that,
it
made
no
difference
with
how
much
stock
they
had.
they
only
have
one
vote.
they
got
that
vote
in
1956
in
mcc
in
1957
“and
all
the
stock
that
is
involved
in
this
suit
did
not
give
them
another
vote,
did
not
give
them
any
additional
eligibility
for
loan,
did
not
give
them
any
additional
right
to
call
on
the
bank
for
services,
it
did
not
give
them
any
fact,
accept
that.
perhaps
in
the
discretion
of
these
parties,
they
might
receive
what?
the
amount
they
had
paid
back
in
20.1,
21.2,
17.1
year
and
the
records
of
the
government
to
14
years
is
without
any
basis
or
facts
whatever.
thank
you.
mr.
john
c.
satterfield
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
we
have
a
very
basic
difference
of
opinion
with
the
government
in
its
position.
in
order
for
the
government
to
prevail
as
has
been
indicated
by
counsel,
they
must
establish
this
proposition
which
appeared
on
page
11
of
their
brief
15
is
taken
to
all
grand
position
on
the
case,
neither
the
fact
that
respondents
are
required
to
invest
in
class
c
stock
in
connection
with
their
loans.
now
the
limitations
on
transferability
of
the
stock
could
convert
its
cost
into
a
deductible
expense.
if
it
otherwise
would
qualify
as
an
income-producing
asset
providing
benefits
in
50
years.
our
position
is
and
i
will
demonstrate
that
this
is
not
an
income-producing
asset,
that
in
fact
it
has
only
a
nominal
value
or
as
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
held
while
it
is
not
worthless
using
the
words
of
that
court,
it
was
without
an
appreciable
market
value
and
had
only
a
nominal
value.
as
said
again
by
that
court,
class
c
stock
shares
are
of
no
appreciable
value
to
the
taxpayer.
as
said
further
in
that
court,
the
class
c
shares
had
no
fair
market
value
and
no
more
than
a
nominal
value
and
no
value
to
the
taxpayers
“in
the
usual
sense.”
now,
reference
had
been
made
by
counsel
both
in
the
brief
and
in
argument,
taking
the
position
that
the
patronage
refund
is
credited
upon
the
books
as
class
c
stock
and
allocated
surplus
credited
upon
the
books
as
a
class
c
stock,
were
credited
upon
and
earned
by
the
amount
paid
as
interest
override
or
for
purchase
of
so-called
of
class
c
stock.
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
is
wholly
without
any
foundation
and
the
statute
and
the
regulations,
in
law
or
in
fact.
the
statute
provides
in
section
1134
(g),
all
patronage
refund
shall
be
paid
in
proportion
the
amount
of
interest
earned
on
the
loans
of
each
borrower
bears
to
the
total
interest
earned
on
the
loans
of
all
borrowers
during
the
year.
it
has
no
relationship
to
the
free
interest
made
at
the
end
of
the
year,
qualify
c
stock
to
with
one
interest,
the
amount
paid
as
interest
override
on
the
class
c
stock
column,
another
entry
on
the
patronage
refund
as
class
c
stock
on
the
column,
another
entry
as
allocated
surplus
on
the
class
c
stock
column.
and
the
regulation
70
part
162
which
appear
on
page
65
of
the
brief
as
an
appendix
of
the
government,
allocation
shall
be
made
in
what?
they
are
wholly
unrelated
to
this,
it
is
just
override
itself.
allocation
shall
be
made
in
proportion
that
the
amount
of
interest
accrued
on
the
loans
of
each
borrower
bears
to
the
total
interest
accrued
on
the
loans
of
all
borrowers
during
the
fiscal
year
and
shall
be
recorded
as
allocations
at
the
end
of
the
fiscal
year.
it
is
impossible
to
conclude
that
the
interest
made
as
patronage
refunds,
allocations
of
surplus
are
returns
upon
the
interest
made
at
the
end
of
the
year
of
the
interest
override
amount
on
the
so-called
class
c
stock.
let
us
take
an
illustration
as
to
what
this
really
means.
these
class
c
stocks
are
in
either
in
that
year
or
in
subsequent
years
any
income.
cooperative
“a”
has
accumulated
a
$150,000.00
in
par
or
face
value
of
class
c
stock.
cooperative
“b”
has
just
come
in
and
bought
one
qualifying
share
of
class
c
stock
on
the
basis
of
$100.00.
each
borrows
from
the
new
orleans
bank
for
cooperatives
that
is
the
same
amount
of
money,
their
loans
are
identical
now.
the
cooperative
with
$150,000.00
in
par
value
of
class
c
stock,
the
cooperative
with
the
$100.00
par
value
of
class
c
stock
received
the
identical
amount
of
patronage
refund,
the
identical
amount
of
allocated
surplus,
the
same
being
related
not
to
class
c
stock
or
to
interest
override.
it
is
related
to
the
interest
paid
upon
the
loan
for
the
year.
that
is
true
both
as
to
the
first
year
and
as
to
every
subsequent
every
year.
so
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
impossible
that
this
can
be
attributed
to
it.
now,
this
has
been
recognized
by
the
government
in
this
case,
in
the
m.f.a
case
and
in
other
cases.
in
this
case,
that
was
included
in
the
district
court
an
attempt
to
recover
patronage
refund.
the
basis
being
that
the
patronage
refund
had
a
value
which
was
a
taxable
value
for
basis
of
$100.00
per
share.
the
district
court
held
against
the
government
on
that.
in
the
court
of
appeals
the
government
abandoned
that
position.
it
did
not
appeal
from
the
district
court
to
the
court
of
appeals.
it
has
not
appealed
to
this
court.
in
the
m.f.a.
case,
come
to
eighth
circuit,
it
was
not
even
involved
in
the
district
court
although
it
is
one
of
the
briefs
it
was
indicated
that
it
might
have
been
involved.
but
in
the
–-
at
the
court
of
appeals
level,
it
was
not
urged
and
now
on
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
now
pending.
it
is
not
urged.
and
why
is
that?
and
mind
you,
this
is
all
the
same
class
c
stock.
no
difference
on
one
class
c
and
another
class
c,
all
interest
as
suggested
by
indicated
on
the
books.
now
why
is
it
that
we
are
not
asked
to
pay
tax
on
the
class
c
stock
on
the
second
column
under
the
heading
patronage
refund?
class
c
was
made
for
class
c
stock
under
the
heading
allocated
surplus
but
only
those
interests
may
at
the
same
time
at
the
end
of
the
year
under
first
column
class
c
stock
said
to
be
resulting
from
the
payment
of
interest
overriding
it.
here
is
the
reason.
in
rome
and
in
cafter,
it
was
hereby
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
fourth
circuit
and
in
regulation,
treasury
regulation
161-5-b-123
and
124,
the
irs
had
taken
the
position
that
while
this
type
of
certificate
or
stock
is
issued
and
is
received
as
patronage
refund,
the
market
value
shall
be
taxed
to
the
patriot
at
the
time
of
the
receipt
and
“the
regulation,”
this
is
taken
all
from
those
two
decisions,
“however,
to
the
parts
of
this
subdivision,
any
document
which
is
payable
only
in
the
discretion
of
a
cooperative
association,
shall
be
considered
not
to
have
any
fair
market
value
unless
it
is
clearly
established
to
the
contract.”
therefore,
this
class
c
stock
while
that
being
1,
2,
or
third
column
does
not
have
market
value
unless
it
is
clearly
established
as
contrary
and
this
record,
as
we
have
shown
in
our
briefs,
as
were
found
by
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
as
was
found
by
the
district
court,
not
only
was
not
clearly
shown
to
have
value
or
market
value
it
was
clearly
shown
to
have
only
a
nominal
value.
that
is
a
matter
of
discretion.
this
illustration
of
the
compensating
balance
is
holding
applicable.
if
there
is
a
compensating
balance,
it
is
repayable
when
the
loan
is
repaid
as
kept
by
loan
value
on
that.
it
serves
money.
what
if
it
does
not
have
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
supplemental
brief?
if
it
is
a
$10,000.00
deal
you
have
a
compensation
of
about
$1,000.00,
you
save
for
about
$9,000.00.
say
upon
8%
you
pay
8.9%
but
the
number
of
dollars
is
the
same.
you
pay
$800.00
interest
on
a
$10,000.00
loan
but
you
deposit
$1,000.00
you
actually
get
$9,000.00.
hence,
you
are
paying
8.9%
and
you
have
a
deduction
for
the
full
$800.00
paid
and
you
do
not
ask
for
it
or
receive
anymore.
but
that
is
your
money,
it
comes
back
to
you
and
you
receive
it.
now
here,
if
or
when,
or
how
under
what
circumstances,
class
c
stock
may
be
revolved
is
within
discretion
of
three
borrowers.
the
market
says
it
has
recommendations
to
original
farm
credit
administration.
there
are
important
credit
administration
recommendations
to
the
farm
credit
administration
within
all
three
discretions
not
to
be
exercised
in
order
for
it
to
be
repaid.
now,
not
only
that
but
there
has
been
some
inadvertent
errors
or
omissions
in
the
brief
which
has
been
filed
by
the
government
in
this
case.
i
think
perhaps
in
receiving
advice
from
the
farm
credit
administration
their
telephone
–-
it
is
just
hard
for
telephone
too
soon.
for
instance,
there
is
a
statement
made
is
not
in
the
record,
no
evidences
are
supplied
whatsoever
it
is
not
--
but
the
statement
is
made
that
they
have
been
advised
by
the
administration,
farm
credit
administration,
this
is
note
number
26
on
page
21
that
all
the
a
stock
in
your
bank
cooperative
have
been
repaid.
but,
and
this
is
what
(inaudible)
assumes,
but
what
actually
happen
was
the
clear
implication,
is
it
was
repaid
by
the
revolving
of
c
stock.
the
fact
is
bank
of
cooperatives,
borrowed
several
millions
of
dollars
on
open
market
in
order
to
pay
it
off
and
now
the
effect
of
it
rather
hastening
the
repayment
of
c
stock
as
a
financial
matter,
it
means
it
would
be
a
longer
period
time
before
the
c
stock
can
be
revolved
because
they
are
paying
a
higher
interest
and
no
matter
they
borrowed
the
a
stock
then
they
were
paying
returns
to
the
government
on
the
a
stock.
now,
it
is
a
fact
that
by
borrowing
that
money,
inviting
themselves
by
that
additional
interest
and
inviting
themselves
with
taxes
in
all
its
exempt,
they
have
reduced
their
financial
ability
to
repay
c
stock.
but
they
have
removed
the
legal
inhibition
which
existed
because
they
could
not
revolve
c
stock
as
long
as
a
was
outstanding,
but
that
is
a
situation
which
has
not
improved
the
possibility
of
the
revolving
of
the
c
stock.
and
it
is
to
that,
now,
i
mentioned
only
in
facing
another
time
in
which
(inaudible)
note
number
16
–-
of
the
note,
i
am
sorry,
on
page
7,
this
is
note
on
page
21.
some
reference
is
made
to
the
possibility
that
if
this
court
holds
this
–
the
taxable
income
there
might
be
a
$100
million
less
lending
power
for
the
banks
for
cooperative.
i
say
that
it
is
kind
of
a
point
to
assume,
but
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
it
should
occur
that
on
the
other
side
of
the
coin
that
the
banks,
it
should
be
held
this
is
interest
income
to
the
bank.
the
statute
having
additional
interest
income
or
margin,
the
statute
requires
that
that
be
paid
to
their
patron.
it
is
not
taxable
income.
it
increases
the
amount
of
patronage
refund
which
is
deductible
from
the
bank
and
from
their
taxable
sources.
in
addition
to
that,
depending
on
the
discretion
of
the
bank
and
they
have
full
discretion,
it
would
not
affect
their
lending
power
in
any
way.
if
they,
in
their
discretion
simply
said
we
would
simply
delay
the
revolving
of
the
earliest
c
stock
because
we
have
a
million
dollars
less
or
$500,000.00
less
since
this
went
out
in
patronage
as
additional
margins.
therefore
there
would
be
no
burden
of
whatever
upon
the
banks
if
that
occurs.
now,
may
i
point
out
to
the
court
a
few
things,
especially
in
connection
with
this
lincoln
case?
mr.
john
c.
satterfield
may
it
please
the
court,
the
answer
is
yes.
in
that
instance
the
$1,000.00
is
placed
in
the
account.
the
actual
$1,000.00
is
repayable
when
the
loan
is
repaid.
it
is
true
that
the
borrower
received
$9,000.00
rather
a
net
of
$9,000.00,
rather
a
net
of
$10,000.00
as
a
loan.
the
only
result
is
he
paying
a
higher
rate
of
interest
because
if
he
pays
8%
on
$10,000.00
that
amounts
to
8.9%
on
a
$9,000.00
and
there,
there
is
no
similarity
to
this
situation
at
all
because
it
is
the
money
of
the
borrower.
it
is
repayable
not
in
possible
discretion
depending
on
as
i
have
listed
in
the
brief
at
11
contingencies
it
may
or
may
not
have,
but
it
is
fund.
it
is
money
there
belonging
to
the
borrower.
therefore
there
is
no
parallel
to
this
case
whatsoever.
it
is
simply
in
that
case
you
see
not
that
there
is
a
lack
by
the
taxpayer
of
claiming
what
he
might
have
earned
by
the
use
of
$1,000.00.
he
has
said
he
required
to
pay
a
higher
rate
of
interest
because
it
gets
the
$9,000.00
loan
and
he
spent
8.9%
interest
by
paying
the
same
interest
that
he
would
have
contracted
upon
$10,000.00,
otherwise
$8,00.00
is
all
the
interest
what
he
paid
on
$10,000.00
loan
on
8%.
if
he
pays
$800.00
a
year
on
a
$9,000.00
loan,
he
pays
8.9%
and
he
has
the
right
to
deduct
the
full
$800.00.
he
does
not
deduct
more,
he
does
not
deduct
less.
he
deducts
what
he
pays.
mr.
john
c.
satterfield
well
as
--
if
you
are
saying
that
in
your
case,
the
point
that
you
have
plenty
of
class
you
divide
it
with
class
c
stock
and
get
to
the
certificate,
you
say
there
is
no
one
tell
you
at
all?
mr.
john
c.
satterfield
well,
has
no
value,
it
had
only
a
number
of
that.
mr.
john
c.
satterfield
right.
and
it
remains
as
in
time
instead
of
a
loan;
it
is
money
belonging
to
the
party
involved,
contingencies
as
to
possible
repayment
in
28.1
years
as
the
evidence
shown
in
this
case
or
31
years
in
penn
yan
case
so
some
other
indefinite
period
of
years
does
not
exist.
it
is
his
money,
like
in
lincoln
case.
now
in
lincoln,
as
the
court
will
remember,
there
was
a
secondary
result.
now
this
secondary
reserve
in
lincoln,
the
money
was
deposited.
now,
under
the
statute
there,
there
were
the
mandatory
provisions
as
the
court
said
in
discussing
the
effect,
three
instances
in
which
the
party
would
get
the
money
back
and
was
required
to
be
paid
the
money
back
by
the
statute,
said
the
court
in
that
case
–-
this
court
on
that
case.
the
prospective
refund
indicates
an
in
cash
effect
of
institution
of
pro-rata
share
upon
culmination
of
its
insured
status
or
upon
receivership
or
liquidation,
or
when
the
primary
reserve
alone
reaches
suspension
level
was
required
to
be
made
by
the
statute.
in
other
words,
if
the
primary
reserve
got
big
enough
the
guy
got
back
what
he
put
in
the
secondary
reserve.
now
in
addition
to
that,
in
that
statute,
there
was
income
producing
as
a
matter
of
fact
because
the
statute
required
that
the
home
loan
of
the
insurance
company
(hlic)
pay
interest
upon
the
secondary
reserve
amounts
in
the
identical
percentages
that
they
received
from
their
obligations
held
by
them
with
the
unites
states
government,
and
in
the
brief,
filed
by
government
in
that
case
it
was
said
without
dispute
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
time
involved
in
this
particular
case
that
there
was
earned
from
3.15
to
4.43%
annually
upon
the
secondary
reserve.
that
was
always
there.
it
was
mandated
to
be
returned
under
any
or
all
circumstances
which
might
occur.
whereas
in
this
case,
this
credit
entered
upon
the
books
is
(1)
as
to
which
the
fund
may
or
may
not
be
repaid.
there
is
quite
a
difference
between
a
legal
right
to
receive
by
a
depositing
case
with
interest
guaranteed
by
the
statute
or
a
right
to
receive
back
a
compensating
deposit
with
the
bank
with
or
without
interest.
as
compared
to
a
situation
in
which
we
have
this.
now,
what
is
this
interest
override?
the
statute
itself
is
clear.
the
statute
says
in
26
u.s.c.
1134
(d)
uses
the
words
that
the
borrower
shall
be
required
to
invest
quarterly
in
class
c
stock
and
of
course
as
we
said
in
lincoln,
so
the
statutory
label
of
prepayment
and
advance
premium
contains
404
(d)
are
not
controlled.
but
as
you
call
it,
the
purchase
of
class
c
stock
is
not
controlled.
the
fact
that
was
made
is
controlled.
it
comes
on
to
the
old
principle
recognized
by
this
court
since
the
beginning
of
taxation.
if
the
substance
is
not
to
fall
the
incisive
substance,
the
incisive
facts
as
distinguished
from
the
form
that
are
governing
all
tax
matters.
now,
how
about
these
amounts?
these
amounts
required
to
be
paid
which
are
here
involved
as
the
only,
the
first
of
the
three
kinds
about
this
stock,
that
is
so
called
interest
override,
an
amount
equal
to
not
less
than
10
not
more
than
15%
of
what,
i
am
reading
it
from
the
statute
now,
“of
the
amount
of
interest
payable
by
it
to
the
bank
during
the
calendar
quarter,
8%
of
the
interest
thus
is
required
to
be
paid.”
now,
this
is
right
significant
sentence
seems
to
me,
this
is
coming
from
the
statute,
“payments
for
such
stock
shall
be
made
quarterly
and
when
the
regular
interest
payments
of
the
borrower
are
payable.”
there
is
no
question
about
the
regulating
an
interest
fall.
within
regular
interest
of
6%
at
this
time,
period
of
time,
let
me
spend
remove
we
are
now
paying
7
or
8
regular
interest,
but
we
pay
15%
more
upon
the
regular
interest.
therefore,
we
do
have
a
valid
question,
a
matter
of
the
payment
of
funds
for
what
part?
now,
let
us
look
at
that
just
a
minute.
why
was
it
paid?
that
is
the
real
question.
why
was
these
amounts
paid?
were
they
paid
as
investment?
are
we
paying
a
$100.00
a
share
for
the
interest
on
the
books
so
called
class
c
stock
as
an
investment
because
we
expected
that
it
might
be
returned
if
the
discretion
was
so
exercised
in
20.4
years
or
21.6
years
without
interest,
without
dividends,
without
any
earning?
well,
of
course
not.
the
incisive
practicality
affects
session
required
that
it
be
determined.
well,
this
taxpayer
paid
the
$99.00
difference
between
the
$100.00
so
called
par
and
the
nominal
value
found
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
district
court
for
the
use
of
money
or
to
buy
an
investment
and
i
do
no
think
there
is
any
businessman
in
the
united
states
would
be
foolish
enough
to
pay
a
$100.00
to
buy
the
so-called
class
c
stock
which
may
in
the
discretion
of
free
bodies,
being
paid
by
some
unknown
date
if
congress
does
not
change
at
all
and
if
the
bank
does
not
decide
to
go
ahead
and
pay
taxes
refund
in
some
other
matter.
mr.
john
c.
satterfield
yes,
i
do.
mr.
john
c.
satterfield
may
it
please
the
court,
our
position
is
this,
that
as
is
set
forth
in
the
statute
itself,
these
preference
dividends
or
refunds
and
allocated
surplus
are
a
participation
in
the
margin
of
profits
of
the
bank
that
they
are
arising
from
the
payment
of
the
--
as
the
statutory
regular
interest.
now,
this
15%
is
at
the
end
of
year,
the
statute
so
provides
and
so
does
70.142
of
the
regulation.
so
the
interest
upon
which
the
government
now
says,
we
receive
patronage
refunds
or
receive
allocated
surplus,
did
not
even
exist
during
the
year.
they
will
make
at
the
end
of
the
year
at
the
same
time
that
the
patronage
refund
and
allocated
surplus
were
credited
for
one
reason.
mr.
john
c.
satterfield
that
actually
has
a
result
if
and
when
it
is
repaid
20
to
31
to
40
years
later
to
the
extent
of
the
value
of
the
money
in
1958
which
may
be
repaid
by
1981.
to
that
extent,
it
will
reduce
the
cost
of
the
regular
interest
and
also
the
interest
override
which
have
added
to
the
regular
interest.
it
would
reduce
to
cost
to
the
extent
of
its
value
by
$1.00
share.
mr.
john
c.
satterfield
yes
sir,
we
believe
and
it
is
our
position
that
if
ever
we
are
repaid,
it
would
be
ordinary
income,
taxable
as
ordinary
income
to
the
borrower
and
that
may
be
28
years
or
31
years
from
now.
mr.
john
c.
satterfield
now,
that
is
true.
it
is
merely
a
possibility
and
possibilities
are
not
taxed
and
we
have
pointed
out
on
page
7
of
our
brief
and
further
on
page
9
of
our
brief,
eleven
contingencies
upon
which
depends
the
amount
paid
and
on
page
9
we
pointed
out
seven
contingencies
or
discretions
which
has
to
be
exercised
if
it
ever
easily
paid.
so
seven
and
11,
18
different
elements
that
are
into
whether
or
not
we
will
ever
see
the
inchoate
income
which
might
come
as
a
result
of
the
interest
which
arose
from
actually
not
the
entry
of
the
first
column
at
the
end
of
the
year.
so
for
interest
over,
whatever
it
may
be
called
class-c
stock,
but
from
the
payment
of
the
regular
interest
quarterly
which
were
paid.
the
interests
of
this
under
the
regulations
are
made
only
at
the
end
of
the
year.
mr.
john
c.
satterfield
to
this
extent
mr.
justice
powell,
the
class
c
stock
is
subject
to
a
lien
securing
any
borrowing
by
the
borrower,
a
loan
by
the
borrower
then
(inaudible),
but
the
record
shows
on
page
242
and
246,
the
testimony
of
the
president
of
the
bank
un-contradicted
this
that
under
no
circumstances
is
it
ever
given
any
collateral
value.
he
testified
that
if
an
application
is
made
for
a
loan
and
if
the
balance
sheet
shows
class
c
stock
by
$100,000.00,
they
strike
that
out
in
arriving
at
the
valuation
or
the
security
given.
it
is
never
used
as
security
to
obtain
a
loan.
it
is
technically
liable
to
a
lien
of
the
repayment
below.
the
bank
has
never
sold
a
single
share
of
class
c
stock
all
of
them
under
compulsion
of
the
statute.
the
testimony
shows
that
unlike
the
situation
in
m.f.a.,
that
there
has
never
been
a
sale
from
one
cooperative
to
the
other
of
new
cooperative
stock,
the
situation
being
fine
severe
or
different.
mr.
john
c.
satterfield
yes,
there
have
been
failing
borrowers.
mr.
john
c.
satterfield
if
in
those
instances
there
was
the
class
c
balance,
they
would
credit
up
to
the
balance
who
would
not
pay
one
nickel
on
what
was
left
over?
mr.
john
c.
satterfield
only
to
the
extent
that
it
was
required
to
balance
all
of
the
loan
if
it
was
sufficient.
mr.
john
c.
satterfield
if
it
was
required
to
pay
the
balance,
otherwise
not.
in
other
words
--
mr.
john
c.
satterfield
oh
well
--
mr.
john
c.
satterfield
mr.
justice
in
the
instance,
i
am
talking
about
that,
it
have
to
be
no
because
in
that
instances
that
were
in
the
record,
there
was
an
insolvency.
there
was
class
c
stock
which
would
balance
all
of
what
was
left
and
additional
class
c
stock.
all
“owned
by
the
borrower”
which
was
not
balanced
of.
now,
this
additional
class
c
stock
“own
by
the
borrower”
was
canceled.
he
got
no
money.
mr.
john
c.
satterfield
yes,
if
there
was
an
opportunity.
mr.
john
c.
satterfield
to
the
extent
that
it
might
be
--
mr.
john
c.
satterfield
right,
in
other
words,
it
was
used
to
balance
to
the
extent
it
was
available.
well,
may
it
please
the
court
we
like
to
close
in
pointing
out
this
fact.
and
that
is
that
the
real
and
only
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
these
payments
of
15%
of
the
regular
interest
were
made
for
the
use
of
money
because
of
the
need
of
use
of
money
in
order
to
obtain
unused
money.
it
was
not
made
as
an
investment
to
obtain
a
capital
income-producing
asset.
i
concede
only
one
answer.
they
were
made
under
compulsion
of
statute.
they
were
made
in
order
to
obtain
and
retain
the
loan.
may
i
call
the
attention
of
the
fact
this
intrinsic
value
argument
has
no
substance
whatever.
this,
unlike
the
home
loan
bank
situation
in
(inaudible),
one
share,
the
qualifying
share
a
$100.00
are
paid
par
value,
part
of
the
constraint
they
issued
the
$100.00
when
they
got
the
fair
share
qualifying
into
the
said
loan.
but
as
they
received
that,
it
made
no
difference
with
how
much
stock
they
had.
they
only
have
one
vote.
they
got
that
vote
in
1956
in
mcc
in
1957
“and
all
the
stock
that
is
involved
in
this
suit
did
not
give
them
another
vote,
did
not
give
them
any
additional
eligibility
for
loan,
did
not
give
them
any
additional
right
to
call
on
the
bank
for
services,
it
did
not
give
them
any
fact,
accept
that.
perhaps
in
the
discretion
of
these
parties,
they
might
receive
what?
the
amount
they
had
paid
back
in
20.1,
21.2,
17.1
year
and
the
records
of
the
government
to
14
years
is
without
any
basis
or
facts
whatever.
thank
you.
