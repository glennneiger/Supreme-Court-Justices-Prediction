mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
federal
income
tax
case
is
hereon
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
it
raises
the
question
whether
farmer
cooperative
associations
like
the
respondents
which
are
required
to
purchase
the
class
c
stock
of
the
new
orleans
bank
of
cooperatives
as
a
condition
to
borrowing
from
the
bank
may
deduct
the
cost
of
such
stock
as
interest
expense
or
as
an
ordinary
necessary
business
expense.
in
new
orleans,
bank
for
cooperatives
is
one
of
12
regional
banks
which
together
with
the
central
bank
here
in
washington
were
created
by
congress
in
1933
to
furnish
credit
to
farmer
cooperatives
at
the
lowest
possible
cost.
the
bank’s
original
capital
was
furnished
by
the
united
states
but
under
a
congressional
plan
embodied
in
the
farm
credit
act
of
1955,
the
government
capital
was
to
be
replaced
gradually
by
capital
belonging
to
member-borrowers
which
would
purchase
class
c
stock.
the
ultimate
goal
of
the
statute
was
complete
borrower
ownership
of
the
banks.
the
banks'
authorize
capital
consists
of
three
classes
of
stock,
a,
b,
and
c,
each
with
a
par
value
of
a
$100.00
a
share.
class
a
stock
represents
the
government’s
initial
contribution
to
capital
is
nonvoting,
pays
no
dividend
and
is
to
be
retired
at
par
with
the
retirement
proceeds
coming
from
borrower
contributions
to
capital
and
the
banks’
earnings.
class
b
stock
is
intended
for
sale
to
the
public.
it
is
issued
at
par,
is
nonvoting
and
may
pay
a
noncumulative
dividend
not
to
exceed
4%
a
year.
after
all,
class
a
stock
has
been
retired;
class
b
stock
may
then
be
retired
at
par,
the
oldest
class
b
stock
to
be
retired
first.
class
c
stock
is
the
voting
common
stock
of
the
banks.
it
may
normally
be
issued
only
to
farmer
cooperatives
at
its
par
value
of
a
$100.00
a
share.
farmer
cooperatives
may
acquire
class
c
stock
in
four
ways.
first,
each
must
purchase
at
least
one
share
of
class
c
stock
to
be
eligible
to
borrow
from
the
bank.
each
of
the
respondents
purchased
the
so-called
qualifying
share
and
capitalized
its
cost.
the
capitalization
treatment
of
the
so-called
qualifying
share
is
not
here
in
dispute.
second,
each
borrower
must
invest
quarterly
in
class
c
stock,
an
amount
equal
to
at
least
10,
but
not
more
than
25%
of
the
interest
and
payees
to
the
bank
on
its
loan
during
the
calendar
quarter.
the
percentage
requirement
of
the
new
orleans
bank
during
the
year’s
here
at
issue
was
15%.
it
is
the
proper
treatment
of
the
cost
of
the
class
c
stock
purchased
under
the
15%
requirement
that
is
herein
dispute.
the
respondents
contend
that
they
may
deduct
in
addition
to
the
stated
interest
on
their
loans,
the
cost
of
class
c
stock
in
excess
of
a
nominal
value
of
a
dollar
share.
they
contend
that
this
is
deductible
as
interest
or
as
ordinary
necessary
business
expense.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
it
pays
no
dividends.
that
is
right
mr.
justice.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
the
situation
is
much
the
same
as
it
was
in
the
lincoln
savings
case
where
there
were
no
stock
certificates.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
just
like
in
the
lincoln
savings
case,
it
is
precisely
that,
no
transfer.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
it
does.
our
position
mr.
justice
is
however
that
even
though
there
is
no
stated
return
on
the
stock,
that
the
farmer
cooperatives
do
indeed
on
the
return
in
that
they
have
a
right
to
share
in
the
profits
of
the
year
in
which
they
purchased
stock.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well
in
the
first
instance,
that
is
the
third
way
in
which
they
acquire
stock
mr.
justice
brennan.
at
the
end
of
each
year,
each
farmer
cooperative
gets
what
is
called
the
patronage
refund
and
then
it
initially
issued
in
the
form
of
class
c
stock.
the
patronage
refund
stock
is
distributed
to
farmer
cooperatives
in
the
proportion
that
the
interest
paid
by
each
cooperative
is
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
it
is
allocated
on
the
books.
that
is
the
same
situation
as
it
was
in
lincoln
where
the
credits
to
the
secondary
reserve.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
the
way
it
realizes
it
perhaps
i
can
refer
the
court
to
the
graph
on
page
163
of
the
record.
it
shows
a
revolving
wheel
and
the
farmer
cooperative
puts
in
its
dollars
at
the
top
of
that
wheel
and
gradually
as
subsequent
borrowers
make
investments
in
class
c
stock.
after
the
government’s
capital
has
been
retired
completely,
and
the
class
b
stock
has
been
retired
completely,
the
class
c
stock
whether
purchased
or
issued
as
a
patronage
refund
is
revolved
out
on
the
cooperative
principle
of
retiring
first
the
oldest
contribution.
now
to
give
you
some
idea
of
what
is
involved
here
mr.
justice
brennan,
let
me
refer
you
to
page
8
of
our
opening
brief.
there
are
several
in
this
case.
we
set
out
there
in
figures
for
the
class
c
stock
purchased;
the
patronage
dividends
and
the
allocated
surplus
credits
received
by
each
farmer
cooperative
here
-–
each
of
the
respondent
cooperative.
now,
let
us
just
take
mississippi
chemical
for
1961.
they
paid
in
$18,940.00
in
change
for
class
c
stock.
now,
that
money
presumably
was
used
to
retire
class
a
stock
or
class
b
stock
or
earlier
issued
class
c
stock.
and
the
same
how
they
received
a
patronage
dividend
in
the
form
of
the
class
c
stock
bookkeeping
entry
of
$27,000.00
and
they
also
received
an
allocated
surplus
credit
of
some
$12,000.00.
the
way
this
thing
works
is
that
at
some
future
time
after
enough
later
people
have
purchased
class
c
stock
they
are
going
to
get
back
not
only
the
19,000.00
that
they
came
up
with
at
the
outset
but
the
total
of
those
three
numbers
in
that
line
which
is
just
under
$59,000.00.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
cash
in
hand
at
an
indefinite
future
time.
i
have
already
referred
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
it
is.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that
is
right
mr.
justice
but
we
see
no
reason
why
an
ordinary
corporation
could
not
instead
of
allowing
stock
to
share
in
the
profits
of
the
corporation
for
all
years
which
is
the
way
it
works
in
an
ordinary
corporation.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
right
and
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
and
it
is
proportional.
that
is
exactly
what
it
comes
down
to
and
it
is
proportional
to
the
stock
purchased
in
that
year
because
of
the
cooperative
mechanism.
the
statute
does
provide
for
an
allocation
in
terms
of
the
interest
paid
by
each
cooperative
to
the
interest
paid
by
all,
but
the
stock
is
purchased
in
the
same
proportion
and
the
respondents’
contention
is
that
we
should
not
decide
this
case
by
reference
to
cooperative
principles
because
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
this
is
the
provision
of
capital
from
the
bank.
and
if
that
were
recognized
this
would
be
a
nondeductible
capital
contribution
and
what
we
are
saying
is
simply
this
that
if
they
do
not
want
the
case
decided
on
the
basis
of
cooperative
principles
under
which
we
clearly
prevail,
we
look
at
the
substance
of
the
thing,
the
substance
is
that
you
are
sharing
the
bank’s
profits
for
that
year.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
exactly.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
mr.
justice,
under
the
statute.
i
will
refer
the
court
to
the
first
page
on
appendix
b
to
our
brief.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
of
our
opening
brief,
i
am
sorry.
that
is
on
page
47.
during
the
years
herein
issue,
the
statutory
limit,
the
stated
interest
was
6%.
now
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
6%
stated
interest
was
the
most
that
any
bank
could
charge.
now
if
you
have
to
pay,
come
up
with
15%
of
that
to
purchase
class
c
stock,
that
would
raise
the
15%
of
6%
as
nine-tenths
of
1%.
so
that
would
be
the
effective
rate.
does
that
answer
your
question
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
yes.
i
was
about
to
say
when
we
say
if
you
borrow
every
year,
so
long
as
your
borrowing
is
outstanding
mr.
justice,
you
do
not
have
to
make
a
new
loan
each
year.
you
have
to
pay
15%
of
the
interest
each
(voice
overlap)
year
that
you
borrow.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
right,
you
share
on
the
profits.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
we
do
not
use
those
terms
because
we
do
not
find
them
in
the
legislative
history,
the
respondents
do.
the
legislative
history
refers
to
these
as
investment
and
patronage
refunds
and
we
will
stick
with
those
statutory
terms.
the
position
of
the
respondents
here
is
that
all
they
got
was
the
right
to
receive
the
money
they
paid
in
at
some
indefinite
future
time.
now,
we
think
we
have
already
shown
that
they
got
more
than
that
if
they
got
the
right
to
receive
that
money
back
in
cash
and
also
got
the
right
to
receive
the
profits
of
the
year
in
which
they
made
the
purchase.
but
our
position
here
does
not
turn
on
whether
there
is
a
retirement
or
not.
in
the
last
brief
which
we
filed
in
october,
we
attempted
to
respond
to
the
respondent’s
contention
that
there
exists
a
universal
principle
that
if
as
a
condition
to
a
loan,
a
borrower
is
required
to
purchase
an
asset
at
more
than
its
fair
market
value,
the
excess
is
deductible
interest.
we
attempted
to
dispute
the
assertion
of
that
universal
principle
by
putting
the
hypothetical
of
a
case
in
which
a
borrower
goes
to
a
commercial
bank
and
asks
to
borrow
$10,000.00
for
10
years
and
the
bank
says
very
well,
we
will
loan
you
$10,000.00
for
10
years
at
a
stated
interest
rate
of
8%.
but
as
a
condition
to
that
loan,
we
are
going
to
ask
you
to
keep
on
hand
in
a
non-interest
bearing
checking
account
$1,000.00
during
the
term
of
the
loan.
we
say
in
that
case
that
only
$800.00
is
deductible
interest.
now,
the
fair
market
value
of
that
compensating
balance
may
be
zero.
it
may
be
that
there
is
no
market
for
restricted
compensating
balances.
nonetheless,
we
say
it
is
clear
that
you
cannot
deduct
the
whole
$1,000.00
because
you
still
own
it.
the
present
value
of
the
$1,000.00
compensating
balance
that
is
the
right
to
receive
$1,000.000
in
10
years,
we
assume
to
be
$650.00.
nevertheless,
we
urge
that
the
$350.00
difference
is
not
deductible
interest.
it
is
simply
interest
that
they
might
have
earned,
but
did
not
earn
and
they
might
have
earned
it
had
they
been
free
to
invest
the
$1,000.00
at
a
growing
rate
of
interest
for
the
10-year
period
rather
than
a
non-interest
bearing
checking
account.
for
this
latter
proposition,
we
relied
on
this
court’s
decision
30
years
ago
in
hort
against
the
commissioner
in
which
the
court
held
that
no
deduction
is
allowable
or
income
that
might
have
been
but
was
not
earned.
in
the
paper
which
respondents
filed
last
week,
they
now
can
see
that
only
$800.00
is
deductible
interest
in
that
hypothetical.
under
their
analysis,
the
borrower
in
the
hypothetical
really
borrowed
only
$9,000.00
and
so
they
say
the
proposition
which
they
originally
asserted
that
whenever
a
borrower
is
required
to
purchase
an
asset
at
more
than
its
fair
market
value,
the
excess
as
deductible
interest
remains
intact.
we
disagree
and
we
submit
that
by
conceding
the
hypothetical,
respondents
have
conceded
this
case.
let
me
put
a
second
hypothetical
to
the
court.
instead
of
having
to
pay
in
to
the
checking
account
$1,000.00
at
the
outset,
the
borrower
has
to
pay
only
$100.00
at
the
outset,
but
on
each
succeeding
anniversary
of
the
loan,
must
also
pay
$100.00.
under
respondents’
analysis,
the
amount
of
the
outstanding
loan
during
the
first
year
would
be
$9,900.00.
the
amount
during
the
second
year
would
be
$9,800.00.
the
amount
during
the
third
year
would
be
$9,700.00
and
so
on,
so
that
on
the
tenth
year,
the
amount
outstanding
on
the
loan
would
be
$9,000.00.
the
average
balance
over
the
10-year
period
would
be
$9,450.00.
nonetheless,
no
more
than
$800.00
would
be
deductible
as
interest
in
any
of
those
years.
if
$1,000.00
based
at
the
outset
is
not
deductible
as
respondents
now
concede,
a
fortiori
a
$100.00
placed
each
year
is
not
deductible.
it
is
no
more
fictional
to
say
in
this
second
hypothetical
that
the
amount
of
the
outstanding
loan
was
reduced
gradually
to
$9,000.00
than
it
is
to
say
that
the
amount
of
the
loans
reduced
gradually
or
reduced
in
the
first
instance
to
$9,000.00
in
the
hypothetical
put
in
our
reply
brief
and
neither
of
those
cases
is
this
case.
but
let
me
move
matters
somewhat
closer
to
home.
take
the
same
facts
as
in
the
second
hypothetical
except
that
instead
of
being
required
to
keep
the
compensating
balance
on
hand
for
only
the
term
of
the
loan
10
years,
the
borrower
has
to
keep
the
compensating
balance
on
hand
for
13
years.
under
respondents’
analysis,
the
borrower
has
borrowed
$9,000.00
for
10
years
or
$9,450.00
in
the
periodic
payment
case
and
has
had
to
leave
on
deposits
for
three
additional
years
in
a
non-interest
bearing
checking
account
of
$1,000.00.
the
fourth
case
tells
us
that
interest
that
they
might
have
earned
on
that
checking
account,
had
it
been
invested
at
the
growing
rate
of
interest
instead
of
a
non-interest
bearing
account.
it
is
not
the
deductible.
finally,
let
me
move
to
the
last
hypothetical
which
i
think
approximates
this
case.
it
is
the
same
as
the
facts
in
the
third
hypothetical
except
that
instead
of
the
banks
agreeing
to
release
the
compensating
balance
at
the
end
of
13
years,
the
release
is
to
be
made
at
an
indefinite
future
time.
this
in
effect
is
the
situation
in
the
instant
case,
on
the
respondents’
assumption
which
we
do
not
agree
with
that
purchased
class
c
stock
earns
no
return
that
it
has
on
other
value
to
respondents.
in
other
words,
that
gives
the
respondents
only
the
right
to
get
their
money
back
at
some
indefinite
future
time.
now,
here
just
as
in
the
third
hypothetical
what
the
borrower
has
foregone
is
simply
the
interest
income
that
he
might
have
earned
from
the
end
of
the
tenth
year,
until
the
indefinite
future
time
that
will
receive
its
money
back.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that
is
right.
we
say
that
it
is
getting
a
return.
we
say
that
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
right.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
oh
in
that
case
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
the
banks
are
empowered
to
possess
the
face
amount
of
class
c
stock
against
the
face
amount.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
legally
entitled?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
no,
it
is
in
the
discretion
of
the
banks,
but
nonetheless
at
some
future
time,
it
will
come
back.
now,
i
think
what
you
are
referring
to
mr.
justice,
the
respondents’
intimate
that
the
bank
may
never
retire
the
class
c
stock.
so
they
will
never
get
their
money
back.
it
is
true
that
there
is
discretion
here
as
to
the
exact
time
and
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that
is
right,
as
to
when
and
really
in
this
case
that
argument
is
wholly
unfitting
because
after
all
we
are
talking
about
instrumentalities
of
the
united
states
and
the
only
way
that
can
achieve
the
purpose
that
congress
has
put
forth
here
is
to
allow
foreign
cooperatives
to
own
the
bank
entirely
and
to
allow
those
who
borrow
from
a
cooperative
bank
to
own
this.
and
these
purposes
can
only
be
achieved
if
the
class
c
stock
has
rolled
over.
they
will
not
be
achieved
if
the
class
c
stock
is
never
redeemed.
furthermore,
if
we
are
talking
about
a
situation
where
the
13
people
who
are
on
the
federal
farm
credit
board
are
very
responsible
officials.
12
are
appointed
by
the
president
of
the
untied
states
with
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate.
they
are
nominated
by
the
farmers
and
the
farmer
cooperatives
itself.
well,
thirteenth
member
of
the
federal
farm
credit
board
is
appointed
by
the
secretary
of
agriculture.
now
as
far
as
the
board
of
directors
of
these
individual
banks,
six
of
them,
six
out
of
the
seven
are
elected
by
farmers
and
farmer
cooperatives.
the
seventh
is
appointed
by
the
governor
or
the
farm
credit
administration.
we
agree
that
there
is
discretion
as
to
timing,
but
we
say
that
there
is
little
doubt
here,
that
the
stock
eventually
will
be
redeemed
and
that
even
on
respondents’
assumption
that
they
are
only
getting
the
right
to
get
their
money
back,
there
is
no
deduction
based
on
the
four
hypotheticals
that
i
have
put
to
the
court.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
should
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
believe
that
there
is
a
return
on
this
investment.
mr.
satterfield
has
addressed
the
fact
that
the
statute
provides
for
the
allocation
of
each
year’s
profits
on
the
basis
of
the
interest
paid
by
one
cooperative
to
the
interest
paid
by
all
and
that
is
what
the
statute
provides.
but
stock
is
purchased
in
the
same
proportion
that
interest
is
paid
and
the
statute
might
as
well
have
provided
that
the
return
is
payable
in
accordance
with
the
ratio
of
the
stock
purchased
by
each
cooperative,
so
the
stock
purchased
by
all
for
the
profits
of
that
one
year.
now,
this
is
different
from
the
division
of
profits
in
an
ordinary
corporation.
if
you
buy
stock
in
an
ordinary
corporation,
you
are
able
to
share
in
the
profits
of
all
years.
in
this
situation,
you
are
able
to
share
in
the
profits
of
only
a
single
year.
as
i
mentioned
too
earlier
however,
it
should
not
make
any
difference.
there
is
no
reason
why
an
ordinary
corporation
could
not
issue
securities
of
the
same
type.
the
fact
remains
that
at
the
end
of
the
period,
whenever
that
indefinite
time
when
the
class
c
stock
is
revolved,
that
these
people
put
in
$19,000.00
in
1961,
they
are
going
to
get
back
$59,000.00
whether
it
would
be
14
years
later
or
30
years
later,
it
is
of
no
consequence.
they
are
going
to
get
it
back.
interest,
mr.
chief
justice
is
not
something
that
you
own,
a
divisible
interest
that
you
own
and
that
you
get
back.
you
do
not
get
interest
back
and
this
is
not
interest.
it
was
the
same
situation
in
lincoln.
it
was
a
kind
of
insurance
even
though
the
only
reason
it
was
paid
into
the
secondary
reserve
was
to
get
car
insurance.
you
got
it
back.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
we
will
accept
that
mr.
chief
justice.
we
will
accept
that
if
that
is
his
representation.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that
is
ordinary
income?
i
am
not
sure
i
understand.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes.
in
addition
attempting
to
show
that
the
stock
does
not
substance
bear
return
mr.
justice
to
the
four
hypotheticals,
i
attempted
to
show
that
even
if
bears
no
return
and
that
it
–-
even
if
it
gives
the
respondents
only
the
right
to
get
their
money
back
at
an
indefinite
future
time
there
is
still
no
deduction.
what
the
respondents
are
seeking
to
deduct
here
is
interest
income
that
they
might
have
earned,
had
they
been
able
to
invest
their
money.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
or
ten
years.
that
is
right
or
13
years
or
20
because
under
their
analysis
you
borrowed
$9,000.00
for
10
years.
now
what
you
are
left
with,
you
have
a
$1,000.00
on
deposit
after
that,
you
do
not
earn
interest.
if
you
have
it
invested
at
interest-bearing
account,
you
would
have
earned
interest.
but
in
howard
against
the
commissioner
30
years
ago,
this
court
held
that
income
that
you
might
have
earned
and
did
not
is
not
deductible
and
the
respondents
do
not
challenge
the
howard
case.
we
cited
it
in
our
brief
and
they
do
not
ask
the
court
to
overrule
it.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
the
$1,000.00
you
purchased?
no.
now,
i
would
like
to
make
one
final
point.
yes
sir
mr.
justice.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
the
$99.00?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that
is
deducting?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that
is
allocated?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
on
the
assumption
that
they
win
this
case
or
lose
it
mr.
justice?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
if
the
government
prevails
in
this
case
and
we
would
not
attempt
to
tax
the
$100.00
that
they
will
be
getting
back.
we
would
attempt
to
tax
the
amounts
in
two
and
three
on
page
8.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
exactly.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that
is
right.
as
ordinary
income.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
now,
one
final
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
exactly.
and
i
think
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
that
even
if
it
was
30
years
and
without
regard
to
the
allocated
surplus
credit,
there
would
still
be
a
return
of
the
slightly
more
than
3%.
while
in
lincoln,
it
was
between
3.15
and
4.75%
at
the
time
on
investment.
but
we
do
not
–-
as
i
say,
i
want
to
stress
we
do
not
rely
exclusively
on
the
fact
that
this
has
to
be
interest-bearing.
we
say,
even
if
the
court
views
it
as
merely
the
right
to
get
your
money
back,
that
under
the
four
compensating
balance
hypotheticals
that
i
referred
to
in
my
opening
remarks,
they
are
trying
to
deduct
income
that
they
might
have
earned,
but
did
not
and
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
that
is
true
and
in
the
case
of
any
investment
in
a
common
stock,
you
only
get
your
money
back
if
the
entity
is
successful.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
exactly,
that
is
the
way
we
described
it
in
our
brief
that
at
the
end
of
the
year,
you
know
you
are
going
to
get
that
$59,000.00
and
you
pay
$19,000.00
for
that
certificate
and
in
the
midland-ross
case,
mr.
justice
brennan
writing
the
opinion
for
the
court,
held
that
that
differential
was
ordinary
income.
one
final
point,
the
court
in
the
lincoln
savings
case,
not
only
discussed
the
secondary
reserve,
but
also
the
federal
home
loan
bank
stock
that
savings
and
loan
associations
are
required
to
purchase
in
order
to
be
members
of
the
local
federal
home
loan
bank
and
the
court
said,
certainly,
the
fhlb
stock
is
an
asset
and
its
acquisition
is
capital
in
nature
that
is
in
403
u.s.
356.
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
statement
there
is
not
qualified
by
whether
you
get
or
return
or
not
get
a
return
on
fhlb
stock.
he
recognized
that,
that
is
an
asset,
a
nondeductible
cost
because
it
was
a
provision
of
capital
for
the
federal
home
loan
banks.
it
provided
as
he
pointed,
requited
the
unavailability
of
loan
funds.
now,
that
is
precisely
the
function
of
the
contributions
to
capital
that
we
are
concerned
with
here.
they
provide
liquidity
and
availability
of
loan
funds.
now,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
certain
federal
home
loan
banks
throughout
the
higher
1960s
pay
the
return
of
roughly
13.75%.
now,
the
going
rate
of
interest
during
the
1960s
are
presumably
was
more
than
13.75%
and
nonetheless,
there
is
no
room
for
the
argument
that
any
portion
of
the
contribution
to
the
federal
home
loan
banks
capital
is
deductible
because
if
they
invested
their
money
elsewhere,
they
might
have
gotten
5%
or
10%.
but
that
is
the
respondents’
argument
in
this
case.
they
even
say
that
the
lincoln
case
is
going
to
be
back
here
next
term
because
they
say
that
–-
well,
let
us
say
if
lincoln
got
4%,
if
lincoln,
if
the
going
rate
of
interest
was
8%,
they
say
that
in
the
fair
market
value,
the
contribution
to
the
secondary
reserve
therefore
was
only
50%
of
the
amount
paid.
they
say
that
lincoln
is
entitled
to
deduct
the
other
half
as
an
ordinary
expense.
that
this
court
really
did
not
resolve
the
secondary
reserve
problem
last
time
and
we
say
that
is
inadmissible
because
there
is
other
value
except
value
in
the
marketplace
and
the
court
recognize
that
other
value
at
403
u.s.
356.
that
is
all
i
have.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
federal
income
tax
case
is
hereon
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
it
raises
the
question
whether
farmer
cooperative
associations
like
the
respondents
which
are
required
to
purchase
the
class
c
stock
of
the
new
orleans
bank
of
cooperatives
as
a
condition
to
borrowing
from
the
bank
may
deduct
the
cost
of
such
stock
as
interest
expense
or
as
an
ordinary
necessary
business
expense.
in
new
orleans,
bank
for
cooperatives
is
one
of
12
regional
banks
which
together
with
the
central
bank
here
in
washington
were
created
by
congress
in
1933
to
furnish
credit
to
farmer
cooperatives
at
the
lowest
possible
cost.
the
bank’s
original
capital
was
furnished
by
the
united
states
but
under
a
congressional
plan
embodied
in
the
farm
credit
act
of
1955,
the
government
capital
was
to
be
replaced
gradually
by
capital
belonging
to
member-borrowers
which
would
purchase
class
c
stock.
the
ultimate
goal
of
the
statute
was
complete
borrower
ownership
of
the
banks.
the
banks'
authorize
capital
consists
of
three
classes
of
stock,
a,
b,
and
c,
each
with
a
par
value
of
a
$100.00
a
share.
class
a
stock
represents
the
government’s
initial
contribution
to
capital
is
nonvoting,
pays
no
dividend
and
is
to
be
retired
at
par
with
the
retirement
proceeds
coming
from
borrower
contributions
to
capital
and
the
banks’
earnings.
class
b
stock
is
intended
for
sale
to
the
public.
it
is
issued
at
par,
is
nonvoting
and
may
pay
a
noncumulative
dividend
not
to
exceed
4%
a
year.
after
all,
class
a
stock
has
been
retired;
class
b
stock
may
then
be
retired
at
par,
the
oldest
class
b
stock
to
be
retired
first.
class
c
stock
is
the
voting
common
stock
of
the
banks.
it
may
normally
be
issued
only
to
farmer
cooperatives
at
its
par
value
of
a
$100.00
a
share.
farmer
cooperatives
may
acquire
class
c
stock
in
four
ways.
first,
each
must
purchase
at
least
one
share
of
class
c
stock
to
be
eligible
to
borrow
from
the
bank.
each
of
the
respondents
purchased
the
so-called
qualifying
share
and
capitalized
its
cost.
the
capitalization
treatment
of
the
so-called
qualifying
share
is
not
here
in
dispute.
second,
each
borrower
must
invest
quarterly
in
class
c
stock,
an
amount
equal
to
at
least
10,
but
not
more
than
25%
of
the
interest
and
payees
to
the
bank
on
its
loan
during
the
calendar
quarter.
the
percentage
requirement
of
the
new
orleans
bank
during
the
year’s
here
at
issue
was
15%.
it
is
the
proper
treatment
of
the
cost
of
the
class
c
stock
purchased
under
the
15%
requirement
that
is
herein
dispute.
the
respondents
contend
that
they
may
deduct
in
addition
to
the
stated
interest
on
their
loans,
the
cost
of
class
c
stock
in
excess
of
a
nominal
value
of
a
dollar
share.
they
contend
that
this
is
deductible
as
interest
or
as
ordinary
necessary
business
expense.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
it
pays
no
dividends.
that
is
right
mr.
justice.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
the
situation
is
much
the
same
as
it
was
in
the
lincoln
savings
case
where
there
were
no
stock
certificates.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
just
like
in
the
lincoln
savings
case,
it
is
precisely
that,
no
transfer.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
it
does.
our
position
mr.
justice
is
however
that
even
though
there
is
no
stated
return
on
the
stock,
that
the
farmer
cooperatives
do
indeed
on
the
return
in
that
they
have
a
right
to
share
in
the
profits
of
the
year
in
which
they
purchased
stock.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well
in
the
first
instance,
that
is
the
third
way
in
which
they
acquire
stock
mr.
justice
brennan.
at
the
end
of
each
year,
each
farmer
cooperative
gets
what
is
called
the
patronage
refund
and
then
it
initially
issued
in
the
form
of
class
c
stock.
the
patronage
refund
stock
is
distributed
to
farmer
cooperatives
in
the
proportion
that
the
interest
paid
by
each
cooperative
is
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
it
is
allocated
on
the
books.
that
is
the
same
situation
as
it
was
in
lincoln
where
the
credits
to
the
secondary
reserve.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
the
way
it
realizes
it
perhaps
i
can
refer
the
court
to
the
graph
on
page
163
of
the
record.
it
shows
a
revolving
wheel
and
the
farmer
cooperative
puts
in
its
dollars
at
the
top
of
that
wheel
and
gradually
as
subsequent
borrowers
make
investments
in
class
c
stock.
after
the
government’s
capital
has
been
retired
completely,
and
the
class
b
stock
has
been
retired
completely,
the
class
c
stock
whether
purchased
or
issued
as
a
patronage
refund
is
revolved
out
on
the
cooperative
principle
of
retiring
first
the
oldest
contribution.
now
to
give
you
some
idea
of
what
is
involved
here
mr.
justice
brennan,
let
me
refer
you
to
page
8
of
our
opening
brief.
there
are
several
in
this
case.
we
set
out
there
in
figures
for
the
class
c
stock
purchased;
the
patronage
dividends
and
the
allocated
surplus
credits
received
by
each
farmer
cooperative
here
-–
each
of
the
respondent
cooperative.
now,
let
us
just
take
mississippi
chemical
for
1961.
they
paid
in
$18,940.00
in
change
for
class
c
stock.
now,
that
money
presumably
was
used
to
retire
class
a
stock
or
class
b
stock
or
earlier
issued
class
c
stock.
and
the
same
how
they
received
a
patronage
dividend
in
the
form
of
the
class
c
stock
bookkeeping
entry
of
$27,000.00
and
they
also
received
an
allocated
surplus
credit
of
some
$12,000.00.
the
way
this
thing
works
is
that
at
some
future
time
after
enough
later
people
have
purchased
class
c
stock
they
are
going
to
get
back
not
only
the
19,000.00
that
they
came
up
with
at
the
outset
but
the
total
of
those
three
numbers
in
that
line
which
is
just
under
$59,000.00.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
cash
in
hand
at
an
indefinite
future
time.
i
have
already
referred
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
it
is.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that
is
right
mr.
justice
but
we
see
no
reason
why
an
ordinary
corporation
could
not
instead
of
allowing
stock
to
share
in
the
profits
of
the
corporation
for
all
years
which
is
the
way
it
works
in
an
ordinary
corporation.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
right
and
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
and
it
is
proportional.
that
is
exactly
what
it
comes
down
to
and
it
is
proportional
to
the
stock
purchased
in
that
year
because
of
the
cooperative
mechanism.
the
statute
does
provide
for
an
allocation
in
terms
of
the
interest
paid
by
each
cooperative
to
the
interest
paid
by
all,
but
the
stock
is
purchased
in
the
same
proportion
and
the
respondents’
contention
is
that
we
should
not
decide
this
case
by
reference
to
cooperative
principles
because
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
this
is
the
provision
of
capital
from
the
bank.
and
if
that
were
recognized
this
would
be
a
nondeductible
capital
contribution
and
what
we
are
saying
is
simply
this
that
if
they
do
not
want
the
case
decided
on
the
basis
of
cooperative
principles
under
which
we
clearly
prevail,
we
look
at
the
substance
of
the
thing,
the
substance
is
that
you
are
sharing
the
bank’s
profits
for
that
year.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
exactly.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
mr.
justice,
under
the
statute.
i
will
refer
the
court
to
the
first
page
on
appendix
b
to
our
brief.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
of
our
opening
brief,
i
am
sorry.
that
is
on
page
47.
during
the
years
herein
issue,
the
statutory
limit,
the
stated
interest
was
6%.
now
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
6%
stated
interest
was
the
most
that
any
bank
could
charge.
now
if
you
have
to
pay,
come
up
with
15%
of
that
to
purchase
class
c
stock,
that
would
raise
the
15%
of
6%
as
nine-tenths
of
1%.
so
that
would
be
the
effective
rate.
does
that
answer
your
question
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
yes.
i
was
about
to
say
when
we
say
if
you
borrow
every
year,
so
long
as
your
borrowing
is
outstanding
mr.
justice,
you
do
not
have
to
make
a
new
loan
each
year.
you
have
to
pay
15%
of
the
interest
each
(voice
overlap)
year
that
you
borrow.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
right,
you
share
on
the
profits.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
we
do
not
use
those
terms
because
we
do
not
find
them
in
the
legislative
history,
the
respondents
do.
the
legislative
history
refers
to
these
as
investment
and
patronage
refunds
and
we
will
stick
with
those
statutory
terms.
the
position
of
the
respondents
here
is
that
all
they
got
was
the
right
to
receive
the
money
they
paid
in
at
some
indefinite
future
time.
now,
we
think
we
have
already
shown
that
they
got
more
than
that
if
they
got
the
right
to
receive
that
money
back
in
cash
and
also
got
the
right
to
receive
the
profits
of
the
year
in
which
they
made
the
purchase.
but
our
position
here
does
not
turn
on
whether
there
is
a
retirement
or
not.
in
the
last
brief
which
we
filed
in
october,
we
attempted
to
respond
to
the
respondent’s
contention
that
there
exists
a
universal
principle
that
if
as
a
condition
to
a
loan,
a
borrower
is
required
to
purchase
an
asset
at
more
than
its
fair
market
value,
the
excess
is
deductible
interest.
we
attempted
to
dispute
the
assertion
of
that
universal
principle
by
putting
the
hypothetical
of
a
case
in
which
a
borrower
goes
to
a
commercial
bank
and
asks
to
borrow
$10,000.00
for
10
years
and
the
bank
says
very
well,
we
will
loan
you
$10,000.00
for
10
years
at
a
stated
interest
rate
of
8%.
but
as
a
condition
to
that
loan,
we
are
going
to
ask
you
to
keep
on
hand
in
a
non-interest
bearing
checking
account
$1,000.00
during
the
term
of
the
loan.
we
say
in
that
case
that
only
$800.00
is
deductible
interest.
now,
the
fair
market
value
of
that
compensating
balance
may
be
zero.
it
may
be
that
there
is
no
market
for
restricted
compensating
balances.
nonetheless,
we
say
it
is
clear
that
you
cannot
deduct
the
whole
$1,000.00
because
you
still
own
it.
the
present
value
of
the
$1,000.00
compensating
balance
that
is
the
right
to
receive
$1,000.000
in
10
years,
we
assume
to
be
$650.00.
nevertheless,
we
urge
that
the
$350.00
difference
is
not
deductible
interest.
it
is
simply
interest
that
they
might
have
earned,
but
did
not
earn
and
they
might
have
earned
it
had
they
been
free
to
invest
the
$1,000.00
at
a
growing
rate
of
interest
for
the
10-year
period
rather
than
a
non-interest
bearing
checking
account.
for
this
latter
proposition,
we
relied
on
this
court’s
decision
30
years
ago
in
hort
against
the
commissioner
in
which
the
court
held
that
no
deduction
is
allowable
or
income
that
might
have
been
but
was
not
earned.
in
the
paper
which
respondents
filed
last
week,
they
now
can
see
that
only
$800.00
is
deductible
interest
in
that
hypothetical.
under
their
analysis,
the
borrower
in
the
hypothetical
really
borrowed
only
$9,000.00
and
so
they
say
the
proposition
which
they
originally
asserted
that
whenever
a
borrower
is
required
to
purchase
an
asset
at
more
than
its
fair
market
value,
the
excess
as
deductible
interest
remains
intact.
we
disagree
and
we
submit
that
by
conceding
the
hypothetical,
respondents
have
conceded
this
case.
let
me
put
a
second
hypothetical
to
the
court.
instead
of
having
to
pay
in
to
the
checking
account
$1,000.00
at
the
outset,
the
borrower
has
to
pay
only
$100.00
at
the
outset,
but
on
each
succeeding
anniversary
of
the
loan,
must
also
pay
$100.00.
under
respondents’
analysis,
the
amount
of
the
outstanding
loan
during
the
first
year
would
be
$9,900.00.
the
amount
during
the
second
year
would
be
$9,800.00.
the
amount
during
the
third
year
would
be
$9,700.00
and
so
on,
so
that
on
the
tenth
year,
the
amount
outstanding
on
the
loan
would
be
$9,000.00.
the
average
balance
over
the
10-year
period
would
be
$9,450.00.
nonetheless,
no
more
than
$800.00
would
be
deductible
as
interest
in
any
of
those
years.
if
$1,000.00
based
at
the
outset
is
not
deductible
as
respondents
now
concede,
a
fortiori
a
$100.00
placed
each
year
is
not
deductible.
it
is
no
more
fictional
to
say
in
this
second
hypothetical
that
the
amount
of
the
outstanding
loan
was
reduced
gradually
to
$9,000.00
than
it
is
to
say
that
the
amount
of
the
loans
reduced
gradually
or
reduced
in
the
first
instance
to
$9,000.00
in
the
hypothetical
put
in
our
reply
brief
and
neither
of
those
cases
is
this
case.
but
let
me
move
matters
somewhat
closer
to
home.
take
the
same
facts
as
in
the
second
hypothetical
except
that
instead
of
being
required
to
keep
the
compensating
balance
on
hand
for
only
the
term
of
the
loan
10
years,
the
borrower
has
to
keep
the
compensating
balance
on
hand
for
13
years.
under
respondents’
analysis,
the
borrower
has
borrowed
$9,000.00
for
10
years
or
$9,450.00
in
the
periodic
payment
case
and
has
had
to
leave
on
deposits
for
three
additional
years
in
a
non-interest
bearing
checking
account
of
$1,000.00.
the
fourth
case
tells
us
that
interest
that
they
might
have
earned
on
that
checking
account,
had
it
been
invested
at
the
growing
rate
of
interest
instead
of
a
non-interest
bearing
account.
it
is
not
the
deductible.
finally,
let
me
move
to
the
last
hypothetical
which
i
think
approximates
this
case.
it
is
the
same
as
the
facts
in
the
third
hypothetical
except
that
instead
of
the
banks
agreeing
to
release
the
compensating
balance
at
the
end
of
13
years,
the
release
is
to
be
made
at
an
indefinite
future
time.
this
in
effect
is
the
situation
in
the
instant
case,
on
the
respondents’
assumption
which
we
do
not
agree
with
that
purchased
class
c
stock
earns
no
return
that
it
has
on
other
value
to
respondents.
in
other
words,
that
gives
the
respondents
only
the
right
to
get
their
money
back
at
some
indefinite
future
time.
now,
here
just
as
in
the
third
hypothetical
what
the
borrower
has
foregone
is
simply
the
interest
income
that
he
might
have
earned
from
the
end
of
the
tenth
year,
until
the
indefinite
future
time
that
will
receive
its
money
back.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that
is
right.
we
say
that
it
is
getting
a
return.
we
say
that
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
right.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
oh
in
that
case
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
the
banks
are
empowered
to
possess
the
face
amount
of
class
c
stock
against
the
face
amount.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
legally
entitled?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
no,
it
is
in
the
discretion
of
the
banks,
but
nonetheless
at
some
future
time,
it
will
come
back.
now,
i
think
what
you
are
referring
to
mr.
justice,
the
respondents’
intimate
that
the
bank
may
never
retire
the
class
c
stock.
so
they
will
never
get
their
money
back.
it
is
true
that
there
is
discretion
here
as
to
the
exact
time
and
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that
is
right,
as
to
when
and
really
in
this
case
that
argument
is
wholly
unfitting
because
after
all
we
are
talking
about
instrumentalities
of
the
united
states
and
the
only
way
that
can
achieve
the
purpose
that
congress
has
put
forth
here
is
to
allow
foreign
cooperatives
to
own
the
bank
entirely
and
to
allow
those
who
borrow
from
a
cooperative
bank
to
own
this.
and
these
purposes
can
only
be
achieved
if
the
class
c
stock
has
rolled
over.
they
will
not
be
achieved
if
the
class
c
stock
is
never
redeemed.
furthermore,
if
we
are
talking
about
a
situation
where
the
13
people
who
are
on
the
federal
farm
credit
board
are
very
responsible
officials.
12
are
appointed
by
the
president
of
the
untied
states
with
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate.
they
are
nominated
by
the
farmers
and
the
farmer
cooperatives
itself.
well,
thirteenth
member
of
the
federal
farm
credit
board
is
appointed
by
the
secretary
of
agriculture.
now
as
far
as
the
board
of
directors
of
these
individual
banks,
six
of
them,
six
out
of
the
seven
are
elected
by
farmers
and
farmer
cooperatives.
the
seventh
is
appointed
by
the
governor
or
the
farm
credit
administration.
we
agree
that
there
is
discretion
as
to
timing,
but
we
say
that
there
is
little
doubt
here,
that
the
stock
eventually
will
be
redeemed
and
that
even
on
respondents’
assumption
that
they
are
only
getting
the
right
to
get
their
money
back,
there
is
no
deduction
based
on
the
four
hypotheticals
that
i
have
put
to
the
court.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
should
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
believe
that
there
is
a
return
on
this
investment.
mr.
satterfield
has
addressed
the
fact
that
the
statute
provides
for
the
allocation
of
each
year’s
profits
on
the
basis
of
the
interest
paid
by
one
cooperative
to
the
interest
paid
by
all
and
that
is
what
the
statute
provides.
but
stock
is
purchased
in
the
same
proportion
that
interest
is
paid
and
the
statute
might
as
well
have
provided
that
the
return
is
payable
in
accordance
with
the
ratio
of
the
stock
purchased
by
each
cooperative,
so
the
stock
purchased
by
all
for
the
profits
of
that
one
year.
now,
this
is
different
from
the
division
of
profits
in
an
ordinary
corporation.
if
you
buy
stock
in
an
ordinary
corporation,
you
are
able
to
share
in
the
profits
of
all
years.
in
this
situation,
you
are
able
to
share
in
the
profits
of
only
a
single
year.
as
i
mentioned
too
earlier
however,
it
should
not
make
any
difference.
there
is
no
reason
why
an
ordinary
corporation
could
not
issue
securities
of
the
same
type.
the
fact
remains
that
at
the
end
of
the
period,
whenever
that
indefinite
time
when
the
class
c
stock
is
revolved,
that
these
people
put
in
$19,000.00
in
1961,
they
are
going
to
get
back
$59,000.00
whether
it
would
be
14
years
later
or
30
years
later,
it
is
of
no
consequence.
they
are
going
to
get
it
back.
interest,
mr.
chief
justice
is
not
something
that
you
own,
a
divisible
interest
that
you
own
and
that
you
get
back.
you
do
not
get
interest
back
and
this
is
not
interest.
it
was
the
same
situation
in
lincoln.
it
was
a
kind
of
insurance
even
though
the
only
reason
it
was
paid
into
the
secondary
reserve
was
to
get
car
insurance.
you
got
it
back.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
we
will
accept
that
mr.
chief
justice.
we
will
accept
that
if
that
is
his
representation.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that
is
ordinary
income?
i
am
not
sure
i
understand.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes.
in
addition
attempting
to
show
that
the
stock
does
not
substance
bear
return
mr.
justice
to
the
four
hypotheticals,
i
attempted
to
show
that
even
if
bears
no
return
and
that
it
–-
even
if
it
gives
the
respondents
only
the
right
to
get
their
money
back
at
an
indefinite
future
time
there
is
still
no
deduction.
what
the
respondents
are
seeking
to
deduct
here
is
interest
income
that
they
might
have
earned,
had
they
been
able
to
invest
their
money.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
or
ten
years.
that
is
right
or
13
years
or
20
because
under
their
analysis
you
borrowed
$9,000.00
for
10
years.
now
what
you
are
left
with,
you
have
a
$1,000.00
on
deposit
after
that,
you
do
not
earn
interest.
if
you
have
it
invested
at
interest-bearing
account,
you
would
have
earned
interest.
but
in
howard
against
the
commissioner
30
years
ago,
this
court
held
that
income
that
you
might
have
earned
and
did
not
is
not
deductible
and
the
respondents
do
not
challenge
the
howard
case.
we
cited
it
in
our
brief
and
they
do
not
ask
the
court
to
overrule
it.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
the
$1,000.00
you
purchased?
no.
now,
i
would
like
to
make
one
final
point.
yes
sir
mr.
justice.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
the
$99.00?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that
is
deducting?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that
is
allocated?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
on
the
assumption
that
they
win
this
case
or
lose
it
mr.
justice?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
if
the
government
prevails
in
this

is
right.
as
ordinary
income.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
now,
one
final
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
exactly.
and
i
think
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
that
even
if
it
was
30
years
and
without
regard
to
the
allocated
surplus
credit,
there
would
still
be
a
return
of
the
slightly
more
than
3%.
while
in
lincoln,
it
was
between
3.15
and
4.75%
at
the
time
on
investment.
but
we
do
not
–-
as
i
say,
i
want
to
stress
we
do
not
rely
exclusively
on
the
fact
that
this
has
to
be
interest-bearing.
we
say,
even
if
the
court
views
it
as
merely
the
right
to
get
your
money
back,
that
under
the
four
compensating
balance
hypotheticals
that
i
referred
to
in
my
opening
remarks,
they
are
trying
to
deduct
income
that
they
might
have
earned,
but
did
not
and
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
that
is
true
and
in
the
case
of
any
investment
in
a
common
stock,
you
only
get
your
money
back
if
the
entity
is
successful.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
exactly,
that
is
the
way
we
described
it
in
our
brief
that
at
the
end
of
the
year,
you
know
you
are
going
to
get
that
$59,000.00
and
you
pay
$19,000.00
for
that
certificate
and
in
the
midland-ross
case,
mr.
justice
brennan
writing
the
opinion
for
the
court,
held
that
that
differential
was
ordinary
income.
one
final
point,
the
court
in
the
lincoln
savings
case,
not
only
discussed
the
secondary
reserve,
but
also
the
federal
home
loan
bank
stock
that
savings
and
loan
associations
are
required
to
purchase
in
order
to
be
members
of
the
local
federal
home
loan
bank
and
the
court
said,
certainly,
the
fhlb
stock
is
an
asset
and
its
acquisition
is
capital
in
nature
that
is
in
403
u.s.
356.
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
statement
there
is
not
qualified
by
whether
you
get
or
return
or
not
get
a
return
on
fhlb
stock.
he
recognized
that,
that
is
an
asset,
a
nondeductible
cost
because
it
was
a
provision
of
capital
for
the
federal
home
loan
banks.
it
provided
as
he
pointed,
requited
the
unavailability
of
loan
funds.
now,
that
is
precisely
the
function
of
the
contributions
to
capital
that
we
are
concerned
with
here.
they
provide
liquidity
and
availability
of
loan
funds.
now,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
certain
federal
home
loan
banks
throughout
the
higher
1960s
pay
the
return
of
roughly
13.75%.
now,
the
going
rate
of
interest
during
the
1960s
are
presumably
was
more
than
13.75%
and
nonetheless,
there
is
no
room
for
the
argument
that
any
portion
of
the
contribution
to
the
federal
home
loan
banks
capital
is
deductible
because
if
they
invested
their
money
elsewhere,
they
might
have
gotten
5%
or
10%.
but
that
is
the
respondents’
argument
in
this
case.
they
even
say
that
the
lincoln
case
is
going
to
be
back
here
next
term
because
they
say
that
–-
well,
let
us
say
if
lincoln
got
4%,
if
lincoln,
if
the
going
rate
of
interest
was
8%,
they
say
that
in
the
fair
market
value,
the
contribution
to
the
secondary
reserve
therefore
was
only
50%
of
the
amount
paid.
they
say
that
lincoln
is
entitled
to
deduct
the
other
half
as
an
ordinary
expense.
that
this
court
really
did
not
resolve
the
secondary
reserve
problem
last
time
and
we
say
that
is
inadmissible
because
there
is
other
value
except
value
in
the
marketplace
and
the
court
recognize
that
other
value
at
403
u.s.
356.
that
is
all
i
have.
