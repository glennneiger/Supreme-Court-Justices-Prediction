chief

warren
e.

before
you
get
to
that
mr.
satterfield,
i
would
like
to
have
your
comment
on
analogy
that
mr.
zinn
suggested.
i
think
he
pointed
out
that
as
he
saw
it,
this
situation
was
very
much
like
a
borrower
going
to
a
bank
to
borrow
$10,000.00,
if
i
followed
his
hypothetical
correctly,
and
the
bank
said
yes,
we
will
lend
you
the
$10,000.00
at
6%
or
whatever,
provided
you
leave
$1,000.00
at
all
times
in
a
non-interest
bank
checking
account.
now,
is
he
unduly
over
simplifying
this
transaction
when
he
puts
that
analogy
to
us?
chief

e.
burger
mr.
satterfield,
the
solicitor
general
made
some
argument
with
respect
to
note
8,
i
think
on
page
8,
of
his
main
brief
in
which
he
set
up
the
cost
of
the
class
c
stock
purchased
and
offset
that
with
the
patronage
dividends
and
allocated
surplus.
what
--
you
recall

what
do
you
have
to
say
about
his
contention
on
that
score?
chief
justice
warren
e.

well,
what
is
your
theory
of
the
impact
of
that
patronage
refund
and
the
allocation
on
the
cost
of
borrowing
this
money?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
you
are
saying,
this
is
just
an
inchoate
income,
this
$27,489.00
for
1961
is
inchoate
income
that
he
may
--
on
which
he
may
have
to
pay
an
income
tax
in
some
future
year?

thank
you,

at
some
point
in
here,
would
you
comment
on
mr.
satterfield’s
comment
on
your
footnote

argument?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
i
understand
mr.
satterfield’s
argument
though
he
said,
i
think
in
response
to
a
question
from
justice
white
that
whenever
this
windfall,
this
return
comes,
it
will
be
taxable
in
this
ordinary
income.
do
you
agree
with
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
this
brings
you
back
to
your
analogy
of
the
$1,000.00?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
non-interest
bearing
checking
account,
but
it
does
not
make
any
difference

you
get
it
back
in
one
year,
you
are
saying
to
us
now
of
four
years?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
say
i
suppose,
if
i
may
interrupt
once
more,
in
response
to
mr.
satterfield’s
point
about
this
being
30
or
40
years
from
now,
that
they
knew
that
when
they
made
the
contract
and
borrowed
the
money,

it
