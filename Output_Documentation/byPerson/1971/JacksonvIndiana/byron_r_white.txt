justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
spencer,
if
he
had
been
civilly
committed,
where
would
he
be
confined
today?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
conceded
by
your
opposition
that
he
definitely
would
be
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
your
supreme
court
say
however
that
irrespective
of
the
root,
he
would
be
at
the
same
place?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
asking
us
to
not
accept
to
that
statement?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
i
have
to
subordinate
questions
here.
when
you
use
the
word
insane
in
the
context
of
that
statute,
if
what
it
means
or
i
am
asking
does
it
mean
that
he
is
incompetent
to
stand
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
my
second
question
and
then
i
will
let
you
proceed.
i
have
read
both
briefs
and
they
seem
to
speak
of
this
feeble
minded
commitment
procedure
you
have
and
also
the
one
in
the
criminal
context.
does
indiana
also
have
a
third
procedure
for
the
commitment
of
the
mentally
ill?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
find
this
unmentioned
in
either
brief.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
this
is
because
it
is
of
no
significance
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
say
that,
let's
suppose
the
state
had
proceeded
to
commit
your
client
as
a
feeble-minded
person
under
the
section
1907?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
committed
him
in
courts
with
the
procedure
outlined
for
the
statute
and
putting
in
the
institution
muscatatuck
or
whatever
it
is,
and
he
was
there.
would
you
say
to
the
state
to
keep
him
there,
or
as
long
as
his
condition
improves?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
just
want
to
know
whether
your
contention
is
that
before
a
state
may
restrain
a
person,
for
as
long
as
this
young
man
has
been
restrained
or
will
be
restrained,
there
must
be
some
finding
that
in
the
proceeding
somewhere
that
he
is
dangerous
to
himself
or
others?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
that
the
state
may
take
custody
of
the
feeble-minded
person,
even
though
he's
not
dangerous
to
himself
or
others
and
keep
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
are
saying
that
without
that
kind
of
interpreting
they
may
take
custody
of
the
feeble-minded
person
and
keep
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
right
and
if
he
needs
treatment,
the
state
may
keep
in
custody
while
they
give
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
existence
of
the
criminal
bar
now
prevent
a
commitment
under
the
feeble-minded
in
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
resist
such
a
procedure?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
sort
of
thought
you
were
claiming
that
if
they
reverse
the
charges
back,
he
can't
stand
trial
because
he
is
incompetent
to
understand
proceeding,
that
the
state
while
they
may
keep
the
criminal
charges
pending
can't
just
put
him
in
the
jail
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
cannot
be
ineffective
because
you
say
the
criminal
charges
must
be
dismissed.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
department
of
mental
health
apparently
can
transfer
him
right
now
to
muscatatuck
or
whatever.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
seems
to
me
like
the
state
court
has
addressed
himself
to
many
of
the
state
law
issues
that
we
are
bringing.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
any
event
isn't
that
a
state
court
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
concededly
he
can
be
placed
in
the
institution
you
want
him
to
be
placed
in.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
you
are
claiming
that
the
state
may
not
charge
a
person
with
crime
and
then
keep
him
in
jail
forever
just
because
he
is
incompetent
to
stand
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
need
to
go
anyway,
whatever
your
broad
claim
is,
it
includes
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
let
us
come
back
to
your
indiana
procedure,
may
only
the
state
institute
a
proceeding
for
commitment
to
feeble-mindedness?
justice
byron
r.
white
be
relative
to
adopting.
you
could
not
--
justice
byron
r.
white
precisely
in
other
words,
you
could
do
it,
if
you
wanted
to
by
a
petition.
justice
byron
r.
white
under
civil
commitment.
justice
byron
r.
white
under
civil
commitment
for
feeble-mindedness,
who
may
institute
that
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
any
record
of
the
citizen?
then
let
me
go
back
to
a
question
i
asked
long
time
ago.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
barrier
to
doing
this,
and
thereby
unraveling
this
procedural
somatic
difficulty
in
your
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
isn't
that
part
of
your
application
for
relief
and
your
feeble-mindedness
procedure
to
ask
that
the
other
judgment
be
set
aside?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
in
the
same
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
it
in
the
same
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
about
that
state
habeas,
do
you
have
habeas
corpus
in
indiana?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
it
lie
to
a
relieve
--
they
claimed
illegal
custody
pursuant
to
a
criminal
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
raise
in
that
court
all
grounds
you
are
raising
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
how
about
federal
habeas?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
compatible
--
lot
of
factual
differences
in
this
situation.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
are
major
differences
between
the
two
of
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
for
example,
of
whether
or
not
that
this
person
was
committed
as
an
insane
person
whether
this
person
is
a
feeble-minded
person,
whether
commitment
under
the
1907
is
available
to
this
particular
person
under
the
indiana
law.
all
of
them
are
argued
here,
before
us
in
the
briefs.
you
have
major
differences
between
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
argue
that's
what
your
supreme
court
decided
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
could
be
placed
there
by
the
department?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
that
be
done
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
letâ€™s
assume
he
had
been
placed,
you
say
that
he
could
have
have.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
he
had
that
placement
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
now
he
would
have
to
be
in
muscatatuck
in
order
to
be
eligible
for
furlough
and
he
could
be
placed
there
inherently.
justice
byron
r.
white
until
he
is
placed
there
and
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
no
furlough
at
the
central
state
hospital?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
have
you
ever
known
a
feeble
person
admitted
under
the
re
is
feeble-minded
section
1907
where
two
have
been
placed
in
the
facilities
of
jackson.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
even
so
as
i
understand
it
other
than
the
differences
to
furlough,
no
matter
where
jackson
is
confined,
if
he
has
to
have
any
release,
he
has
to
initiate
a
habeas
proceeding
under
your
practice
to
get
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
indiana,
i
don't
think,
there
have
never
been
any
criminal
charges
here
it
means
to
me
that
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
why
doesn't
state
commit
him
civilly
and
then
let
the
civil
statutes
operate
therefore?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
has
never
been
established
in
indiana,
yet
that
he
is
a
feeble
minded
person
--
.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
you
take
this
redundant?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
maybe
because
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
i
know,
but
that's
all
of
the
assumption
that
the
state
has
come
over
just
because
it
can't
understand
the
criminal
charges.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
didn't
you
say
that,
you
know
of
no
other
case
where
the
feeble
minded
ended
up
from
central
state
hospital.
justice
byron
r.
white
certainly,
where
he
is
now,
he
has
no
furlough
possibility,
he
would
have
at
muscatatuck.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
there
isn't
any
practical
possibility
for
a
person
(inaudible)
have
you
ever
heard
that
for
instance
has
been
committed
for
his
inability
to
understand
the
criminal
charge(inaudible)
being
transferred
to
muscatatuck?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
could
be
help
for
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
has
ever
decided
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
spencer,
if
he
had
been
civilly
committed,
where
would
he
be
confined
today?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
conceded
by
your
opposition
that
he
definitely
would
be
there?

(inaudible)
why
doesn't
state
commit
him
civilly
and
then
let
the
civil
statutes
operate
therefore?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
has
never
been
established
in
indiana,
yet
that
he
is
a
feeble
minded
person
--
.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
you
take
this
redundant?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
maybe
because
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
i
know,
but
that's
all
of
the
assumption
that
the
state
has
come
over
just
because
it
can't
understand
the
criminal
charges.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
didn't
you
say
that,
you
know
of
no
other
case
where
the
feeble
minded
ended
up
from
central
state
hospital.
justice
byron
r.
white
certainly,
where
he
is
now,
he
has
no
furlough
possibility,
he
would
have
at
muscatatuck.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
there
isn't
any
practical
possibility
for
a
person
(inaudible)
have
you
ever
heard
that
for
instance
has
been
committed
for
his
inability
to
understand
the
criminal
charge(inaudible)
being
transferred
to
muscatatuck?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
could
be
help
for
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
has
ever
decided
that.
