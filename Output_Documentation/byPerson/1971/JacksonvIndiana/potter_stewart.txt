justice
potter
stewart
he
is
a
deaf
child?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
he
was
a
mental
age
with
3
or
4-year-old
deaf
child.
justice
potter
stewart
that
he
being
who
the
judge
or
--?
justice
potter
stewart
your
basic
constitutional
argument
that
closely
parallels
the
dissenting
opinion
of
justice
debruler
absolutely
in
court.
trial
counsel
was
you
say
the
signed
counsel
because
jackson
as
an
indigent.
trial
counsel
was
assigned
by
the
court.
justice
potter
stewart
what
explains
the
change
in
counsel?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
sad
you
didn't
represent
him.
justice
potter
stewart
that
leaves
counsel
on
appeal
free
to
make
the
claim
that
there
was
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
at
the
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
i
take
it
one
of
your
–
as
i
read
your
brief,
you
suggest
that
under
indiana
law
he
cannot
then
be
committed
under
1907?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
to
say
if
we
have
a
civil,
and
where
what
do
you
called
this
place?
i
can't
quite
--
justice
potter
stewart
muscatatuck,
and
he
was
committed
there,
that
the
authority
of
the
commission
of
the
transfer,
would
have
committed
the
commission
of
transfer
right
where
he
is
now?
justice
potter
stewart
how
can
there
be
a
proceeding
initiated,
whether
it's
under
this
commitment
or
under
the
civil
commitment
to
get
the
due
process
hearing
that
he
now
can
comprehend
the
thing?
how
does
that
come
to
that?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i
thought
you
said
earlier
that
under
either
this
commitment
or
a
civil
commitment,
it's
possible
to
have
a
due
process
hearing
and
which
it
shall
be
determined
whether
he
is
to
remain
committed
or
to
be
released
or
?
justice
potter
stewart
how
is
that
initiated?
justice
potter
stewart
my
question
goes
to,
how
now
can
there
be
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
he
ought
to
be
released
to
understand
trial,
that's
what
i
meant?
justice
potter
stewart
suppose
there
have
never
been
any
criminal
charges
here,
but
someone
had
initiated
a
civil
judgment
and
he
were
now
at
either
place
under
civil
commitment
and
he
want
it
out.
how
could
he
initiate
a
proceeding
to
get
out?
justice
potter
stewart
only
by
habeas?
justice
potter
stewart
but
right
now,
you
just
say
you
assume
that.
justice
potter
stewart
jackson's
remedy
is
only
habeas
corpus.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is,
he
can
comprehend.
justice
potter
stewart
yeah.
and
if
he
filed
habeas
corpus
will
he
get
a
full
scale
reprocess
hearing
on
the
question
whether
he
is
now
saying
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
jackson
is
not
eligible
now
for
any
follow
ups.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
his
theory
is
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
at
this
place?
justice
potter
stewart
alright,
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
at
this
place
he
is
not
eligible
for
anything.
justice
potter
stewart
if
he
had
been
committed
civilly
as
a
feeble-minded
person
and
had
been
placed
in
this
particular
prison
--
justice
potter
stewart
after
the
commitment
of
feeble-minded,
would
he
be
then
be
eligible
for
furlough?
justice
potter
stewart
i
gather
are
those
offenses
(inaudible)
so
that
means
if
he
will
be
there
at
least
50
years
before
he
would
serve
--
the
possible
term
he
could
serve.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
we
don't
even
have
that
much
of
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
but
my
point
would
be
--
comprehension,
you
lose
all
those
application.
justice
potter
stewart
but
so
he
stays
there
for
the
rest
of
his
life.
justice
potter
stewart
i
was
addressing
my
question
only
to
your
statement
that
he
very
clearly
could
never
be
released,
if
he
were
civilly
committed.
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
wondered
how
inevitable
that
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
doesn't
require
that
a
person
recovers.
this
language
i
just
read
to
you,
not
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
let
me
point
out
to
you
that
for
27
years
he
was
not
in
an
institution.
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
had
two
jobs.
justice
potter
stewart
well
not
most
three
and
four
year
children
are
not
in
institutions.
are
they?
justice
potter
stewart
his
mother
is
still
living?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
the
non-comprehension
test
for
not
trying
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
he
is
a
deaf
child?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
he
was
a
mental
age
with
3
or
4-year-old
deaf
child.
