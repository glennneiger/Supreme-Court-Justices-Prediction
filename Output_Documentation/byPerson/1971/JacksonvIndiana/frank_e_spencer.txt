mr.
frank
e.
spencer
mr.
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
hope
you
won't
consider
my
comment
too
dramatic
under
the
circumstance,
if
i
respectfully
call
to
the
court's
attention
at
the
outset
that
at
this
time,
the
petitioner
here
is
confined
in
the
central
state
hospital
for
the
insane
in
indianapolis
because
of
two
charges,
which
were
filed
against
him
in
may
of
'68,
charging
the
commission
of
two
robberies,
ten
months
before
that
in
1967,
that
there
has
been
no
hearing
in
respect
to
probable
cause
that
the
petitioner
is
a
deaf
mute,
neither
able
to
hear
nor
to
speak,
having
a
mental
age
of
a
3
or
4
year-old
child
and
that
the
--
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
yes
sir,
i
say
he
is
deaf,
he
is
unable
to
speak.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
the
witness
at
that
instance
emphasized
that
and
i
appreciate
your
calling
that
to
my
attention
and
he
will
be
confined
unless
this
court
sees
fit
to
do
something
about
it
for
the
rest
of
his
life.
i
depreciate
the
contention
of
the
state
of
indiana
in
this
cause,
that
it
makes
no
difference,
that
there
is
no
difference
between
a
civil
or
criminal
commitment
in
this
proceeding.
and
that
he
may
recover
flying
in
the
face
of
the
evidence
which
was
heard
by
the
trial
court.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
he
would
be
at
muscatatuck
your
honor.
there
are
two
institutions
in
indiana,
one
at
fort
wayne
and
one
at
muscatatuck
--
with
his
age
and
the
area
of
the
state,
which
he
is
from,
he
would
be
at
muscatatuck.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
i
don't.
well,
they
disputed
to
the
extent
that
with
a
vale
of
words,
they
say
that
he
couldn't
get
there,
i
don't
think
that
they
dispute
that
if
he
were
in
fact
committed
as
a
feeble
minded
person,
that
he
would
be
at
muscatatuck.
they
also
repeat
their
statement
of
the
supreme
court
of
indiana,
a
very
superficial
statement
that
there
is
nothing
to
worry
about
anyway
because
as
a
charge
of
the
department
of
mental
health,
he
could
be
transferred
to
muscatatuck.
it
is
our
position
that
there
is
a
great
difference
and
that
by
the
holding
of
our
court
for
the
first
time
that
muscatatuck
is
by
definition
under
our
statute
a
psychiatric
institution
and
therefore,
that
a
transfer
could
be
made
from
the
psychiatric
institution
at
central
state
hospital
to
muscatatuck
does
not
answer
the
problem.
he
is
not
at
muscatatuck
and
if
he
were
at
muscatatuck
under
a
transfer,
he
would
still
be
held
by
reason
of
the
commitment
of
the
criminal
court.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
they
didn't
say
he
would
be,
they
said
he
could
and
--
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
for
practical
purposes,
i
think
there
is
a
world
of
difference
and
it
does
not
answer
the
problem
your
honor.
the
fact
that
they
now
hold
and
this
was
a
holding
for
the
first
instance,
and
as
far
as
i
know,
there
never
has
been
such
a
transfer.
they
hold
as
a
matter
of
law.
now
in
this
case,
that
the
department
through
the
commissioner
would
have
the
power
to
transfer
him
to
muscatatuck,
but
that
doesn't
answer
the
problem
because
arriving
at
muscatatuck
under
a
transfer
does
not
change
the
nature
of
his
commitment
and
he
has
been
committed
as
a
person
found
to
be
insane
under
an
indiana
statute
designed
for
the
use
in
instances
in
which
person's
insane
had
been
charged
with
crimes
and
under
the
judgment
of
the
criminal
court
of
marion
county,
he
cannot
be
released
until
he
has
recovered
his
sanity.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
well,
under
the
statute
and
i
dispute
the
position
of
the
indiana
court
in
this
regard.
the
statute
speaks
in
terms
of
insanity,
the
determinative
principle
as
to
whether
or
not
he
will
be
committed
on
the
one
hand
or
held
to
trial
on
the
other,
and
go
to
trial
is
the
determination
of
his
comprehension
or
lack
of
comprehension
to
understand
the
nature
of
the
proceedings
and
to
assist
his
counsel
in
defense.
the
state
of
indiana,
through
the
attorney
general
has
taken
the
position
that
that
is
insanity
and
not
only
that,
but
that
is
the
same
insanity
to
use
that
word
as
contemplated
in
the
section
of
the
statute
in
regard
to
what
i
referred
to
as
the
civil
commitment,
which
requires
as
a
condition
precedent
that
a
physician
certify
that
the
person
for
whom
application
is
made
is
not
insane.
i
don't
see
any
great
difficulty
involved
in
differentiating
between
the
two.
the
statute
in
respect
to
a
person
charged
with
crime
contemplates
that
some
persons,
not
all,
who
are
insane
will
be
found
to
lack
comprehension
to
understand
the
nature
of
the
proceedings
and
to
assist
in
their
defense
and
those
persons,
not
everyone
who
is
insane,
but
those
persons
who
are
found
to
lack
comprehension
shall
be
committed.
on
the
other
hand,
there
is
no
standard
in
respect
to
the
civil
commitment
of
a
feeble
minded
person
to
muscatatuck,
except
that
which
i
respectfully
submit
is
now
generally
considered
and
denominated
a
mental
illness.
the
statute
--
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
that
is
correct.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
i
do
not
think
it
is
of
any
significance,
except
to
render
questionable
or
at
least
indicate
question
in
regard
to
the
state's
position
that
insanity,
in
the
statute
for
commitment
has
reference
to
the
same
insanity,
the
same
concept
of
insanity
in
the
provision,
in
the
criminal
proceedings.
there
is
a
difference.
persons
who
are
insane
maybe
committed
under
an
entirely
separate
procedure,
persons
that
we
are
speaking
of
are
persons
who
are
mentally
ill,
persons
who
are
committed
to
muscatatuck
in
the
school
at
fort
wayne
are
committed
because
they
are
feeble
minded
and
that
the
legislature
for
a
long
period
of
time
has
determined
as
a
matter
of
policy
that
those
persons
who
are
mentally
ill
should
not
be
so
committed
that
they
go
some
place
else
and
therefore,
as
provided
this
condition
precedent
that
a
physician
certify
that
they
are
not
insane.
the
provision
in
regard
to
the
person
charged
with
crime,
dealing
with
persons
who
are
insane
is
only
concerned
with
the
one
aspect
of
mental
illness
whether
or
not
there
is
such
mental
illness
there
that
the
effective
result
is
that
they
lack
the
comprehension
to
understand
the
nature
of
the
proceedings
and
to
assist
in
their
defense.
to
me,
that
does
not
equate
the
terminology
of
insanity
in
the
one
statute
with
the
terminology
of
insanity
as
negative
as
a
condition
precedent
in
the
other
statute.
we
are
talking
about
two
different
things
and
i
think
that
the
existence
of
the
separate
procedure
for
feeble
minded
persons
emphasizes
what
i
am
talking
about
even
though
both
statutes
have
existed
for
a
long
time
in
indiana.
if
it
has
come
up
before
i
am
unaware
of,
this
is
the
first
instance
that
i
know
of
in
indiana
where
a
muscatatuck
feeble
minded
person
has
been
committed
under
this
statute
designed
to
take
care
of
the
person
with
a
mental
illness
who
lacks
comprehension
to
understand
the
nature
of
the
charges
against
him
and
who
therefore
is
committed
until
he
shall
become
sane,
until
he
shall
regain
that
much
comprehension,
in
spite
of
his
prior
existing
mental
illness.
i
would
like
to
invite
your
attention
to
some
statements
made
by
the
state
of
indiana.
excuse
me.
i'd
better
go
back
for
just
a
moment
in
regard
to
how
this
developed.
it
is
very
clear
in
the
transcript
and
i
have
set
out
in
the
appendix,
at
the
conclusion
of
the
hearing
held
in
the
trial
court.
this
contemplates
the
appointment
of
two
physicians
and
these
two
physicians
were
appointed
and
tested
by
dr.
nai
and
dr.
houster
(ph)
also
the
superintendent
who
had
worked
with
this
man,
who
had
experience
in
background
at
the
desk,
had
worked
with
this
man.
he
had
attempted
to
communicate
and
was
available
to
the
two
physicians
who
examined
him
and
there
is
no
dispute
in
the
testimony
before
the
court
that
this
is
a
condition
that
will
remain,
that
we're
not
talking
about
a
mental
illness,
we're
talking
about
a
retardation.
it
is
a
condition
that
does
exist
and
has
existed,
a
retardation
and
the
fact
that
this
man
is
even
unable
to
understand
and
comprehend
the
usual
sign
language
of
the
deaf
mutes,
just
a
very,
very
small
amount
of
that
can
he
even
comprehend.
to
emphasize
the
limitations
of
this
comprehension
in
his
testimony
this
supervisor
informed
the
court
that
the
man
has
no
comprehension
of
time,
he
has
no
comprehension
of
when,
he
has
no
comprehension
of
how,
and
then
as
i
state
the
--
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
well,
and
to
conclusion
of
your
question
you
used
the
word
which
the
state
has
used,
which
i
dispute.
it
is
not
a
matter
as
to
whether
or
not
he
improves,
as
contended
by
the
state.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
no,
that
is
not
a
necessity
and
that's
not
my
contention.
the
determination
must
--
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
whether
or
not
he's
dangerous
is
not
a
sole
determination.
that
may
be
a
determination
--
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
yes
sir.
if
he
needs
treatment,
if
the
interest
of
society
and
he
is
in
fact
feeble-minded
and
there
is
an
interest
there
he
can
be
--
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
absolutely.
no
question
about
that.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
well,
i'm
not
going
to
take
the
position
that
the
care
offered
by
the
state
of
indiana
at
muscatatuck
is
merely
custodial.
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
if
he
were
committed
on
a
civil
commitment
of
this
fashion,
he
would
be
receiving
more
than
custodial
care.
they
have
a
good
setup.
the
difference
lies
not
in
how
he's
being
treated,
but
in
how,
when
and
under
what
circumstances
he
is
able
to
be
released
and
what
the
attitude
is.
there
is
no
chance,
the
way
he
has
been
committed
in
the
criminal
proceedings
merely
because
of
pendency
of
two
criminal
charges
for
which
there
is
never
even
been
a
hearing
as
to
probable
cause.
there
is
no
chance
he
will
ever
be
released
because
--
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
no
sir,
but
it
is
a
moot
question
because
he
is
in
fact
in
the
custody
of
the
state.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
no
sir.
but
i
would
resist
doing
anything
that
would
not
also
include
the
dismissal
of
the
criminal
charges.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
because
he
can
not
be
released
under
any
circumstances
as
long
as
the
present
commitment
stands
based
upon
the
existence
of
the
two
criminal
charges.
he
cannot
be
released
until
he
recovers
his
sanity.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
something
that
he
never
lost
except
in
terms
of
comprehension.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
no
sir.
that
is
not
my
position.
there
are
persons
who
are
taking
the
position.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
no.
let
me
say
this.
because
of
the
aspects
in
this
case,
he
is
not
only
a
deaf,
mute
unable
to
communicate,
but
he
has
a
mental
age
of
3
or
4
that
in
these
circumstances
he
is
feeble-minded,
he
should
be
in
muscatatuck.
there
is
no
basis
for
the
existence
of
the
criminal
charges
as
a
matter
of
fairness
and
justice,
these
prevent
his
civil
commitment
because
they
are
the
basis
of
his
criminal
commitment.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
that's
what
the
supreme
court
says.
but
he
--
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
if
the
court
please,
the
state
court
did
not
address
itself
to
the
basic
issue
involved
as
to
the
applicability
of
the
statute
and
the
result.
they
related
at
the
outset
what
the
position
of
--
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
no
sir.
absolutely
not.
this
man
is
imprisoned
for
life
and
has
never
had
a
trial
and
cannot
get
out
under
any
procedure.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
and
can
never
get
out.
and
on
a
civil
commitment
he
can
get
out
merely
on
the
determination
of
the
superintendent
that
it
is
in
his
interest
and
that
it's
okay
in
effect.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
no,
i
think
this
case
is
broader
than
that.
i
think
this
case
is
broader
than
that.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
that
is
a
part
of
it.
that
is
correct
but
only
honest
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
i'm
not
going
to
contend
before
you
that
all
of
the
law
should
be
changed,
that
there
should
be
a
tremendous
upheaval
maybe
yes,
maybe
no.
but
under
these
circumstances
even
the
state
of
indiana
concedes
that
there
is
no
criminal
responsibility
here
and
yet
the
basis
for
his
being
maintained
is
the
existence
of
the
criminal
charge.
i
invite
your
attention.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
there
is
nothing
that
the
state
can
do
at
this
point
as
far
as
i
concede
because
the
commitment
unless
you
do
something
about
it
is
a
final
judgment.
at
any
give
point
along
the
way,
the
state
could
have
dismissed
the
criminal
charges.
but
there
is
a
judgment
rendered
and
it
except
for
the
disposition
in
this
court
has
become
final
and
he
will
be
held
until
he
is
certified
sane
and
that
will
never
be.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
well
it
certainly
be
a
better
help.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
the
judgment
of
the
lower
court
should
be
reversed.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
no.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
the
man
has
already
been
in
there
your
honor
for
--
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
well,
if
this
court
would
determine
that
has
of
the
time
of
your
decision
that
the
state
must
take
such
action.
that
would
be
the
relief.
if
it's
that
you
may
keep
him
now
for
another
seven
or
eight
years.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
if
i
understand
you
correctly,yes.
the
thing
that
i
strenuously
object
to,
is
the
prospective
application
of
the
judgment
throughout
the
life,
of
the
man
who
has
been
charged
with
no
possibility
of
release.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
if
there
was
nothing
further
done
on
the
criminal
charges
and
if
he
were
civilly
committed.
no
i
wouldn't
care,
what
would
happen
as
far
as
the
charges
that
would
take
care
of
itself.
but
they
have
proceeded
by
reason
of
those
charges.
the
way
things
stand
now.
so
that
he
is
committed
merely
by
a
reason
of
the
existence
of
those
charges.
if
he
were
civilly
committed,
so
that
he
could
be
released
just
on
the
basis
of
determination
of
the
superintendent
at
muscatatuck.
that
under
the
circumstances
that's
what
should
be
done.
that's
what
the
statute
amounts
to.
i
don't
think
that;
that
two,
three,
four,
five
years
from
the
time
that
he
goes
in,
that
the
state
is
going
to
be
interested
in
proceedings
in
respect
to
the
criminal
charges.
i
invite
the
court's
attention
to
the
statement
made
by
the
state
of
indiana
at
page
4
of
the
brief
of
the
respondent,
stating
that
should,
jackson
recover.
his
present
incompetency
could
effectively
absolve
jackson
of
all
criminal
responsibility,
for
the
acts
of
robbery
themselves
even
though
there
has
been
no
trial
on
the
merits
to
determine
whether
jackson
committed
the
acts
charged.
and
if
so
whether
he
was
criminally
responsible
at
the
time
they
were
committed,
but
what
the
state
is
asking
is
that
you
postpone
that
determination
or
that
that
determination
be
postponed,
until
he
has
recovered
his
sanity,
which
will
never
be.
and
this
is
what
they
have
referred
to
in
their
brief
as
“the
indiana
solution”
and
they
additionally
point
out
for
the
edification
of
this
court,
that
his
incompetency
does
not
bar
the
state
from
charging
robbery
even
though
no
further
proceedings
maybe
held.
in
this
situation,
it
is
the
same,
as
if
they
were
charging
a
three-year-old
child.
and
in
essence
they
are
writing
about
the,
power
that
the
state
has
to
bring
the
charge
and
cause
a
life
commitment,
because
of
the
existence
of
the
charge,
when
they
in
fact
admit
that
under
these
circumstances
when
they
get
around
to
determining
it,
after
infinity
that
there
was
and
never
has
been
any
criminal
responsibility.
i
started
to
mention
that
a
few
minutes
ago,
and
i
want
to
point
that
out.
the
trial
court
even
though
the
supreme
court,
three
judges,
haven't
didn't
appear
to
be
particularly
bothered.
the
trial
court
was
concerned
about
the
result
that
was
impending
in
these
proceedings.
he
made
a
point
at
the
conclusion
of
inquiring
as
to
whether
the
attorney
then
representing
the
defendant
felt
that
any
other
statute
could
be
used.
and
then
he
directed
that
attorney
who
by
the
way
was
proper
counsel,
directed
that
attorney
to
file
a
motion
for
a
new
trial,
agreeing
with
him
that
this
determination
was
an
appealable
determination.
and
he
has
maintained
his
interest
that
this
matter
be
pursued
for
final
solution.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
the
judge,
the
judge
was
very
much
disturbed
by
what
appeared
to
be
the
necessary
result
in
the
application
of
this
statute
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
on
its
face,
this
statute
was
designed
for
an
entirely
different
circumstance.
and
it
is
an
abortion
to
apply
it,
to
a
situation
like
this.
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
only
solution
as
a
matter
of
due
process,
is
that
the
state
be
allowed
an
opportunity
to
obtain
civil
commitment,
and
the
criminal
charges
be
dismissed
or
even
if
they
are
going
to
pend
at
least
that
no
further
proceedings
be
had
and
that
this
commitment
until
he
recovers
his
sanity
be
vacated.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
yes
your
honor.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
differentiating
in
between
the
court
and
the
state.
no,
the
court
can
initiate
it
when
anything
comes
to
his
attention
which
raises
a
question
as
to
the
comprehensive
ability
of
the
defendant,
the
defendant's
counsel
can
do
it,
the
prosecuting
attorney
can
do
it.
the
judge
in
open
court
observing
--
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
you
are
talking
about
under
the
criminal
statute.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
any
resident
in
the
county.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
rapidly
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
because
of
the
outstanding
commitment
from
which
we
are
dealing.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
judge,
your
honor
i
know
of
no
precedent
anywhere
in
the
law
that
the
persons
involved
in
litigation
as
against
whom
a
final
judgment
has
been
rendered,
particularly
coerce
in
commitment,
can
at
any
given
point
merely
ignore
it.
it's
there
and
he
is
in
fact
being
held
in
custody
by
reason
of
this.
now
if
we
add
another
civil
commitment
to
it,
or
ten
commitments
it
will
not
erase
or
change
the
fact,
that
until
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
is
set
aside
committing
him
under
the
statute
designed
for
insane
persons,
until
he
shall
recover
his
sanity,
he
cannot
be
released.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
that
could
not
be
done,
no
that
would
be
a
collateral
attack
on
a
judgment
in
an
entirely
separate
case
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
no
sir,
no
sir,
the
court
in
which
these
proceedings
were
had
has
criminal
jurisdictional.
the
civil
commitment
would
be
in
our
superior
or
criminal
court
and
as
the
state
has
also
pointed
out,
as
long
as
the
present
commitment
stands,
we
have
a
judicial
determination,
res
judicata,
as
between
the
state
of
indiana
and
this
defendant
that
he
is
insane,
and
they
contend
it's
the
same
concept
of
insanity
and
until
this
is
set
aside
and
vacated,
it
would
be
a
complete
bar
to
a
determination
in
a
civil
proceedings,
that
he
is
not
insane.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
well
whether
or
not
it
would
in
some
instance
where
no
appeal
had
been
pursued,
i
don't
know.
it
could
not
lie
here
because
appeal
was
pursued
in
the
highest
court
and
the
state
of
indiana
has
affirmed
the
commitment.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
if
you
had
denied
certiorari
i
would
try
it.
you
accepted
certiorari
and
it's
your
baby
and
i
am
very
happy
to
be
here
now.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
the
state
contends
that
i
see
none.
i
don't
see
the
necessity.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
well
major
in
the
nature
of
the
conclusion
not
major
in
nature
of
the
basis,
i
submit
that
it's
a
veil
of
words
as
far
as
the
attorney
general
is
concerned.
that
there
are
no
major
differences
in
terms
of
the
facts.
i
think
they
are
concession
here
in
regard
to
the
incompetence,
is
in
direct
conflict
with
many
of
other
insertions
which
they
make.
thank
you
gentlemen.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
yes
sir,
as
are
we,
proper
counsel
all
the
way.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
no
change,
we
are
proper
counsel.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
oh
i
am
sorry
i
misunderstood,
as
a
matter
of
procedure
with
which
i
certainly
approve
that
it's
been
a
custom
for
sometime,
our
two
criminal
courts
in
marion
county
do
not
appoint
the
same
attorney
to
proceed
on
appeal
as
was
in
the
trail.
we
have
the
benefit
of
everything
they
did,
they
are
there
to
confer
with,
but
over
a
long
period
of
time
as
a
matter
of
practice,
they
appointed
another
attorney
to
proceed
with
the
appeal
in
any
criminal
case.
there
is
nothing
there,
than
a
matter
of
custom
and
determination
of
policy.
nothing
in
this
case
that
call
for
that.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
occasionally.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
pretty
much
case
law
your
honor.
pretty
much
case
law
in
indiana.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
the
county
treasure
yes
sir,
but
it
is
not
a
statutory
procedure
setup.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
the
discharge
provisions
are
essentially
the
same
your
honor.
jackson
as
a
practical
matter
would
be
in
as
good,
as
position
to
be
released
under
what
has
been
described
as
the
criminal
commitment
statute
9-1706
a
when
he
gains
comprehension
--
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
the
superintendent
of
the
institution
your
honor.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
your
honor
let
me
submit
to
you
that
--
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
no
matter
what
--
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
yes
sir,
and
after
the
--
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
after
the
jackson
decision
in
this
case,
by
the
indiana
court,
he
could
have
very
well
gone
to
central
state.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
i
submit
to
you
mr.
justice
marshall
that
we
are
not
saying
here
that
jackson
had
to
go
central
state
because
he
was
insane
under
9-1706
a
and
then
therefore
not
feeble-minded
under
the
other
statute.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
i
don’t
take
that
position;
i
say
he
was
sent
there
because
the
mental
heath
commissioner
decided
that
was
the
best
place
for
him,
who
had
the
alternative
to
send
him
to
muscatatuck.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
i
said,
i
didn’t
know
of
any
case
where
feeble-minded
were
sent
to
muscatatuck
when
i
asked
why,
i
said
because
that’s
to
central
state
because
historically
central
state
that
has
been
for
more
serious.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
serious.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
that
isn’t
necessary
for
the
central
state.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
we
don’t
make
the
distinction
in
indiana
your
honor
between
criminally
insane
and
civilly
insane.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
that
is
not
the
case.
he
would
not
have
ended
up
in
muscatatuck
absent
the
charges.
he
would
have
ended
up
where
the
mental
health
commissioner
sent
him
which
may
have
well
been
central
state.
that
discretion
is
within
the
mental
health
commissioner
and
as
justice
arterburn
said
in
his
opinion
that’s
his
expertise,
not
jackson’s.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
mr.
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
hope
you
won't
consider
my
comment
too
dramatic
under
the
circumstance,
if
i
respectfully
call
to
the
court's
attention
at
the
outset
that
at
this
time,
the
petitioner
here
is
confined
in
the
central
state
hospital
for
the
insane
in
indianapolis
because
of
two
charges,
which
were
filed
against
him
in
may
of
'68,
charging
the
commission
of
two
robberies,
ten
months
before
that
in
1967,
that
there
has
been
no
hearing
in
respect
to
probable
cause
that
the
petitioner
is
a
deaf
mute,
neither
able
to
hear
nor
to
speak,
having
a
mental
age
of
a
3
or
4
year-old
child
and
that
the
--
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
yes
sir,
i
say
he
is
deaf,
he
is
unable
to
speak.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
the
witness
at
that
instance
emphasized
that
and
i
appreciate
your
calling
that
to
my
attention
and
he
will
be
confined
unless
this
court
sees
fit
to
do
something
about
it
for
the
rest
of
his
life.
i
depreciate
the
contention
of
the
state
of
indiana
in
this
cause,
that
it
makes
no
difference,
that
there
is
no
difference
between
a
civil
or
criminal
commitment
in
this
proceeding.
and
that
he
may
recover
flying
in
the
face
of
the
evidence
which
was
heard
by
the
trial
court.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
he
would
be
at
muscatatuck
your
honor.
there
are
two
institutions
in
indiana,
one
at
fort
wayne
and
one
at
muscatatuck
--
with
his
age
and
the
area
of
the
state,
which
he
is
from,
he
would
be
at
muscatatuck.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
i
don't.
well,
they
disputed
to
the
extent
that
with
a
vale
of
words,
they
say
that
he
couldn't
get
there,
i
don't
think
that
they
dispute
that
if
he
were
in
fact
committed
as
a
feeble
minded
person,
that
he
would
be
at
muscatatuck.
they
also
repeat
their
statement
of
the
supreme
court
of
indiana,
a
very
superficial
statement
that
there
is
nothing
to
worry
about
anyway
because
as
a
charge
of
the
department
of
mental
health,
he
could
be
transferred
to
muscatatuck.
it
is
our
position
that
there
is
a
great
difference
and
that
by
the
holding
of
our
court
for
the
first
time
that
muscatatuck
is
by
definition
under
our
statute
a
psychiatric
institution
and
therefore,
that
a
transfer
could
be
made
from
the
psychiatric
institution
at
central
state
hospital
to
muscatatuck
does
not
answer
the
problem.
he
is
not
at
muscatatuck
and
if
he
were
at
muscatatuck
under
a
transfer,
he
would
still
be
held
by
reason
of
the
commitment
of
the
criminal
court.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
they
didn't
say
he
would
be,
they
said
he
could
and
--
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
for
practical
purposes,
i
think
there
is
a
world
of
difference
and
it
does
not
answer
the
problem
your
honor.
the
fact
that
they
now
hold
and
this
was
a
holding
for
the
first
instance,
and
as
far
as
i
know,
there
never
has
been
such
a
transfer.
they
hold
as
a
matter
of
law.
now
in
this
case,
that
the
department
through
the
commissioner
would
have
the
power
to
transfer
him
to
muscatatuck,
but
that
doesn't
answer
the
problem
because
arriving
at
muscatatuck
under
a
transfer
does
not
change
the
nature
of
his
commitment
and
he
has
been
committed
as
a
person
found
to
be
insane
under
an
indiana
statute
designed
for
the
use
in
instances
in
which
person's
insane
had
been
charged
with
crimes
and
under
the
judgment
of
the
criminal
court
of
marion
county,
he
cannot
be
released
until
he
has
recovered
his
sanity.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
well,
under
the
statute
and
i
dispute
the
position
of
the
indiana
court
in
this
regard.
the
statute
speaks
in
terms
of
insanity,
the
determinative
principle
as
to
whether
or
not
he
will
be
committed
on
the
one
hand
or
held
to
trial
on
the
other,
and
go
to
trial
is
the
determination
of
his
comprehension
or
lack
of
comprehension
to
understand
the
nature
of
the
proceedings
and
to
assist
his
counsel
in
defense.
the
state
of
indiana,
through
the
attorney
general
has
taken
the
position
that
that
is
insanity
and
not
only
that,
but
that
is
the
same
insanity
to
use
that
word
as
contemplated
in
the
section
of
the
statute
in
regard
to
what
i
referred
to
as
the
civil
commitment,
which
requires
as
a
condition
precedent
that
a
physician
certify
that
the
person
for
whom
application
is
made
is
not
insane.
i
don't
see
any
great
difficulty
involved
in
differentiating
between
the
two.
the
statute
in
respect
to
a
person
charged
with
crime
contemplates
that
some
persons,
not
all,
who
are
insane
will
be
found
to
lack
comprehension
to
understand
the
nature
of
the
proceedings
and
to
assist
in
their
defense
and
those
persons,
not
everyone
who
is
insane,
but
those
persons
who
are
found
to
lack
comprehension
shall
be
committed.
on
the
other
hand,
there
is
no
standard
in
respect
to
the
civil
commitment
of
a
feeble
minded
person
to
muscatatuck,
except
that
which
i
respectfully
submit
is
now
generally
considered
and
denominated
a
mental
illness.
the
statute
--
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
that
is
correct.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
i
do
not
think
it
is
of
any
significance,
except
to
render
questionable
or
at
least
indicate
question
in
regard
to
the
state's
position
that
insanity,
in
the
statute
for
commitment
has
reference
to
the
same
insanity,
the
same
concept
of
insanity
in
the
provision,
in
the
criminal
proceedings.
there
is
a
difference.
persons
who
are
insane
maybe
committed
under
an
entirely
separate
procedure,
persons
that
we
are
speaking
of
are
persons
who
are
mentally
ill,
persons
who
are
committed
to
muscatatuck
in
the
school
at
fort
wayne
are
committed
because
they
are
feeble
minded
and
that
the
legislature
for
a
long
period
of
time
has
determined
as
a
matter
of
policy
that
those
persons
who
are
mentally
ill
should
not
be
so
committed
that
they
go
some
place
else
and
therefore,
as
provided
this
condition
precedent
that
a
physician
certify
that
they
are
not
insane.
the
provision
in
regard
to
the
person
charged
with
crime,
dealing
with
persons
who
are
insane
is
only
concerned
with
the
one
aspect
of
mental
illness
whether
or
not
there
is
such
mental
illness
there
that
the
effective
result
is
that
they
lack
the
comprehension
to
understand
the
nature
of
the
proceedings
and
to
assist
in
their
defense.
to
me,
that
does
not
equate
the
terminology
of
insanity
in
the
one
statute
with
the
terminology
of
insanity
as
negative
as
a
condition
precedent
in
the
other
statute.
we
are
talking
about
two
different
things
and
i
think
that
the
existence
of
the
separate
procedure
for
feeble
minded
persons
emphasizes
what
i
am
talking
about
even
though
both
statutes
have
existed
for
a
long
time
in
indiana.
if
it
has
come
up
before
i
am
unaware
of,
this
is
the
first
instance
that
i
know
of
in
indiana
where
a
muscatatuck
feeble
minded
person
has
been
committed
under
this
statute
designed
to
take
care
of
the
person
with
a
mental
illness
who
lacks
comprehension
to
understand
the
nature
of
the
charges
against
him
and
who
therefore
is
committed
until
he
shall
become
sane,
until
he
shall
regain
that
much
comprehension,
in
spite
of
his
prior
existing
mental
illness.
i
would
like
to
invite
your
attention
to
some
statements
made
by
the
state
of
indiana.
excuse
me.
i'd
better
go
back
for
just
a
moment
in
regard
to
how
this
developed.
it
is
very
clear
in
the
transcript
and
i
have
set
out
in
the
appendix,
at
the
conclusion
of
the
hearing
held
in
the
trial
court.
this
contemplates
the
appointment
of
two
physicians
and
these
two
physicians
were
appointed
and
tested
by
dr.
nai
and
dr.
houster
(ph)
also
the
superintendent
who
had
worked
with
this
man,
who
had
experience
in
background
at
the
desk,
had
worked
with
this
man.
he
had
attempted
to
communicate
and
was
available
to
the
two
physicians
who
examined
him
and
there
is
no
dispute
in
the
testimony
before
the
court
that
this
is
a
condition
that
will
remain,
that
we're
not
talking
about
a
mental
illness,
we're
talking
about
a
retardation.
it
is
a
condition
that
does
exist
and
has
existed,
a
retardation
and
the
fact
that
this
man
is
even
unable
to
understand
and
comprehend
the
usual
sign
language
of
the
deaf
mutes,
just
a
very,
very
small
amount
of
that
can
he
even
comprehend.
to
emphasize
the
limitations
of
this
comprehension
in
his
testimony
this
supervisor
informed
the
court
that
the
man
has
no
comprehension
of
time,
he
has
no
comprehension
of
when,
he
has
no
comprehension
of
how,
and
then
as
i
state
the
--
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
well,
and
to
conclusion
of
your
question
you
used
the
word
which
the
state
has
used,
which
i
dispute.
it
is
not
a
matter
as
to
whether
or
not
he
improves,
as
contended
by
the
state.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
no,
that
is
not
a
necessity
and
that's
not
my
contention.
the
determination
must
--
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
whether
or
not
he's
dangerous
is
not
a
sole
determination.
that
may
be
a
determination
--
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
yes
sir.
if
he
needs
treatment,
if
the
interest
of
society
and
he
is
in
fact
feeble-minded
and
there
is
an
interest
there
he
can
be
--
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
absolutely.
no
question
about
that.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
well,
i'm
not
going
to
take
the
position
that
the
care
offered
by
the
state
of
indiana
at
muscatatuck
is
merely
custodial.
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
if
he
were
committed
on
a
civil
commitment
of
this
fashion,
he
would
be
receiving
more
than
custodial
care.
they
have
a
good
setup.
the
difference
lies
not
in
how
he's
being
treated,
but
in
how,
when
and
under
what
circumstances
he
is
able
to
be
released
and
what
the
attitude
is.
there
is
no
chance,
the
way
he
has
been
committed
in
the
criminal
proceedings
merely
because
of
pendency
of
two
criminal
charges
for
which
there
is
never
even
been
a
hearing
as
to
probable
cause.
there
is
no
chance
he
will
ever
be
released
because
--
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
no
sir,
but
it
is
a
moot
question
because
he
is
in
fact
in
the
custody
of
the
state.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
no
sir.
but
i
would
resist
doing
anything
that
would
not
also
include
the
dismissal
of
the
criminal
charges.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
because
he
can
not
be
released
under
any
circumstances
as
long
as
the
present
commitment
stands
based
upon
the
existence
of
the
two
criminal
charges.
he
cannot
be
released
until
he
recovers
his
sanity.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
something
that
he
never
lost
except
in
terms
of
comprehension.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
no
sir.
that
is
not
my
position.
there
are
persons
who
are
taking
the
position.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
no.
let
me
say
this.
because
of
the
aspects
in
this
case,
he
is
not
only
a
deaf,
mute
unable
to
communicate,
but
he
has
a
mental
age
of
3
or
4
that
in
these
circumstances
he
is
feeble-minded,
he
should
be
in
muscatatuck.
there
is
no
basis
for
the
existence
of
the
criminal
charges
as
a
matter
of
fairness
and
justice,
these
prevent
his
civil
commitment
because
they
are
the
basis
of
his
criminal
commitment.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
that's
what
the
supreme
court
says.
but
he
--
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
if
the
court
please,
the
state
court
did
not
address
itself
to
the
basic
issue
involved
as
to
the
applicability
of
the
statute
and
the
result.
they
related
at
the
outset
what
the
position
of
--
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
no
sir.
absolutely
not.
this
man
is
imprisoned
for
life
and
has
never
had
a
trial
and
cannot
get
out
under
any
procedure.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
and
can
never
get
out.
and
on
a
civil
commitment
he
can
get
out
merely
on
the
determination
of
the
superintendent
that
it
is
in
his
interest
and
that
it's
okay
in
effect.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
no,
i
think
this
case
is
broader
than
that.
i
think
this
case
is
broader
than
that.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
that
is
a
part
of
it.
that
is
correct
but
only
honest
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
i'm
not
going
to
contend
before
you
that
all
of
the
law
should
be
changed,
that
there
should
be
a
tremendous
upheaval
maybe
yes,
maybe
no.
but
under
these
circumstances
even
the
state
of
indiana
concedes
that
there
is
no
criminal
responsibility
here
and
yet
the
basis
for
his
being
maintained
is
the
existence
of
the
criminal
charge.
i
invite
your
attention.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
there
is
nothing
that
the
state
can
do
at
this
point
as
far
as
i
concede
because
the
commitment
unless
you
do
something
about
it
is
a
final
judgment.
at
any
give
point
along
the
way,
the
state
could
have
dismissed
the
criminal
charges.
but
there
is
a
judgment
rendered
and
it
except
for
the
disposition
in
this
court
has
become
final
and
he
will
be
held
until
he
is
certified
sane
and
that
will
never
be.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
well
it
certainly
be
a
better
help.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
the
judgment
of
the
lower
court
should
be
reversed.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
no.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
the
man
has
already
been
in
there
your
honor
for
--
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
well,
if
this
court
would
determine
that
has
of
the
time
of
your
decision
that
the
state
must
take
such
action.
that
would
be
the
relief.
if
it's
that
you
may
keep
him
now
for
another
seven
or
eight
years.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
if
i
understand
you
correctly,yes.
the
thing
that
i
strenuously
object
to,
is
the
prospective
application
of
the
judgment
throughout
the
life,
of
the
man
who
has
been
charged
with
no
possibility
of
release.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
if
there
was
nothing
further
done
on
the
criminal
charges
and
if
he
were
civilly
committed.
no
i
wouldn't
care,
what
would
happen
as
far
as
the
charges
that
would
take
care
of
itself.
but
they
have
proceeded
by
reason
of
those
charges.
the
way
things
stand
now.
so
that
he
is
committed
merely
by
a
reason
of
the
existence
of
those
charges.
if
he
were
civilly
committed,
so
that
he
could
be
released
just
on
the
basis
of
determination
of
the
superintendent
at
muscatatuck.
that
under
the
circumstances
that's
what
should
be
done.
that's
what
the
statute
amounts
to.
i
don't
think
that;
that
two,
three,
four,
five
years
from
the
time
that
he
goes
in,
that
the
state
is
going
to
be
interested
in
proceedings
in
respect
to
the
criminal
charges.
i
invite
the
court's
attention
to
the
statement
made
by
the
state
of
indiana
at
page
4
of
the
brief
of
the
respondent,
stating
that
should,
jackson
recover.
his
present
incompetency
could
effectively
absolve
jackson
of
all
criminal
responsibility,
for
the
acts
of
robbery
themselves
even
though
there
has
been
no
trial
on
the
merits
to
determine
whether
jackson
committed
the
acts
charged.
and
if
so
whether
he
was
criminally
responsible
at
the
time
they
were
committed,
but
what
the
state
is
asking
is
that
you
postpone
that
determination
or
that
that
determination
be
postponed,
until
he
has
recovered
his
sanity,
which
will
never
be.
and
this
is
what
they
have
referred
to
in
their
brief
as
“the
indiana
solution”
and
they
additionally
point
out
for
the
edification
of
this
court,
that
his
incompetency
does
not
bar
the
state
from
charging
robbery
even
though
no
further
proceedings
maybe
held.
in
this
situation,
it
is
the
same,
as
if
they
were
charging
a
three-year-old
child.
and
in
essence
they
are
writing
about
the,
power
that
the
state
has
to
bring
the
charge
and
cause
a
life
commitment,
because
of
the
existence
of
the
charge,
when
they
in
fact
admit
that
under
these
circumstances
when
they
get
around
to
determining
it,
after
infinity
that
there
was
and
never
has
been
any
criminal
responsibility.
i
started
to
mention
that
a
few
minutes
ago,
and
i
want
to
point
that
out.
the
trial
court
even
though
the
supreme
court,
three
judges,
haven't
didn't
appear
to
be
particularly
bothered.
the
trial
court
was
concerned
about
the
result
that
was
impending
in
these
proceedings.
he
made
a
point
at
the
conclusion
of
inquiring
as
to
whether
the
attorney
then
representing
the
defendant
felt
that
any
other
statute
could
be
used.
and
then
he
directed
that
attorney
who
by
the
way
was
proper
counsel,
directed
that
attorney
to
file
a
motion
for
a
new
trial,
agreeing
with
him
that
this
determination
was
an
appealable
determination.
and
he
has
maintained
his
interest
that
this
matter
be
pursued
for
final
solution.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
the
judge,
the
judge
was
very
much
disturbed
by
what
appeared
to
be
the
necessary
result
in
the
application
of
this
statute
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
on
its
face,
this
statute
was
designed
for
an
entirely
different
circumstance.
and
it
is
an
abortion
to
apply
it,
to
a
situation
like
this.
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
only
solution
as
a
matter
of
due
process,
is
that
the
state
be
allowed
an
opportunity
to
obtain
civil
commitment,
and
the
criminal
charges
be
dismissed
or
even
if
they
are
going
to
pend
at
least
that
no
further
proceedings
be
had
and
that
this
commitment
until
he
recovers
his
sanity
be
vacated.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
yes
your
honor.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
differentiating
in
between
the
court
and
the
state.
no,
the
court
can
initiate
it
when
anything
comes
to
his
attention
which
raises
a
question
as
to
the
comprehensive
ability
of
the
defendant,
the
defendant's
counsel
can
do
it,
the
prosecuting
attorney
can
do
it.
the
judge
in
open
court
observing
--
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
you
are
talking
about
under
the
criminal
statute.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
any
resident
in
the
county.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
rapidly
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
because
of
the
outstanding
commitment
from
which
we
are
dealing.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
judge,
your
honor
i
know
of
no
precedent
anywhere
in
the
law
that
the
persons
involved
in
litigation
as
against
whom
a
final
judgment
has
been
rendered,
particularly
coerce
in
commitment,
can
at
any
given
point
merely
ignore
it.
it's
there
and
he
is
in
fact
being
held
in
custody
by
reason
of
this.
now
if
we
add
another
civil
commitment
to
it,
or
ten
commitments
it
will
not
erase
or
change
the
fact,
that
until
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
is
set
aside
committing
him
under
the
statute
designed
for
insane
persons,
until
he
shall
recover
his
sanity,
he
cannot
be
released.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
that
could
not
be
done,
no
that
would
be
a
collateral
attack
on
a
judgment
in
an
entirely
separate
case
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
no
sir,
no
sir,
the
court
in
which
these
proceedings
were
had
has
criminal
jurisdictional.
the
civil
commitment
would
be
in
our
superior
or
criminal
court
and
as
the
state
has
also
pointed
out,
as
long
as
the
present
commitment
stands,
we
have
a
judicial
determination,
res
judicata,
as
between
the
state
of
indiana
and
this
defendant
that
he
is
insane,
and
they
contend
it's
the
same
concept
of
insanity
and
until
this
is
set
aside
and
vacated,
it
would
be
a
complete
bar
to
a
determination
in
a
civil
proceedings,
that
he
is
not
insane.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
well
whether
or
not
it
would
in
some
instance
where
no
appeal
had
been
pursued,
i
don't
know.
it
could
not
lie
here
because
appeal
was
pursued
in
the
highest
court
and
the
state
of
indiana
has
affirmed
the
commitment.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
if
you
had
denied
certiorari
i
would
try
it.
you
accepted
certiorari
and
it's
your
baby
and
i
am
very
happy
to
be
here
now.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
the
state
contends
that
i
see
none.
i
don't
see
the
necessity.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
well
major
in
the
nature
of
the
conclusion
not
major
in
nature
of
the
basis,
i
submit
that
it's
a
veil
of
words
as
far
as
the
attorney
general
is
concerned.
that
there
are
no
major
differences
in
terms
of
the
facts.
i
think
they
are
concession
here
in
regard
to
the
incompetence,
is
in
direct
conflict
with
many
of
other
insertions
which
they
make.
thank
you
gentlemen.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
yes
sir,
as
are
we,
proper
counsel
all
the
way.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
no
change,
we
are
proper
counsel.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
oh
i
am
sorry
i
misunderstood,
as
a
matter
of
procedure
with
which
i
certainly
approve
that
it's
been
a
custom
for
sometime,
our
two
criminal
courts
in
marion
county
do
not
appoint
the
same
attorney
to
proceed
on
appeal
as
was
in
the
trail.
we
have
the
benefit
of
everything
they
did,
they
are
there
to
confer
with,
but
over
a
long
period
of
time
as
a
matter
of
practice,
they
appointed
another
attorney
to
proceed
with
the
appeal
in
any
criminal
case.
there
is
nothing
there,
than
a
matter
of
custom
and
determination
of
policy.
nothing
in
this
case
that
call
for
that.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
occasionally.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
pretty
much
case
law
your
honor.
pretty
much
case
law
in
indiana.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
the
county
treasure
yes
sir,
but
it
is
not
a
statutory
procedure
setup.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
the
discharge
provisions
are
essentially
the
same
your
honor.
jackson
as
a
practical
matter
would
be
in
as
good,
as
position
to
be
released
under
what
has
been
described
as
the
criminal
commitment
statute
9-1706
a
when
he
gains
comprehension
--
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
the
superintendent
of
the
institution
your
honor.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
your
honor
let
me
submit
to
you
that
--
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
no
matter
what
--
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
yes
sir,
and
after
the
--
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
after
the
jackson
decision
in
this
case,
by
the
indiana
court,
he
could
have
very
well
gone
to
central
state.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
i
submit
to
you
mr.
justice
marshall
that
we
are
not
saying
here
that
jackson
had
to
go
central
state
because
he
was
insane
under
9-1706
a
and
then
therefore
not
feeble-minded
under
the
other
statute.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
i
don’t
take
that
position;
i
say
he
was
sent
there
because
the
mental
heath
commissioner
decided
that
was
the
best
place
for
him,
who
had
the
alternative
to
send
him
to
muscatatuck.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
i
said,
i
didn’t
know
of
any
case
where
feeble-minded
were
sent
to
muscatatuck
when
i
asked
why,
i
said
because
that’s
to
central
state
because
historically
central
state
that
has
been
for
more
serious.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
serious.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
that
isn’t
necessary
for
the
central
state.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
we
don’t
make
the
distinction
in
indiana
your
honor
between
criminally
insane
and
civilly
insane.
mr.
frank
e.
spencer
that
is
not
the
case.
he
would
not
have
ended
up
in
muscatatuck
absent
the
charges.
he
would
have
ended
up
where
the
mental
health
commissioner
sent
him
which
may
have
well
been
central
state.
that
discretion
is
within
the
mental
health
commissioner
and
as
justice
arterburn
said
in
his
opinion
that’s
his
expertise,
not
jackson’s.
