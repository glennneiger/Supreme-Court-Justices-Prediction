mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
may
i
present
my
associates
at
the
counsel
table
with
me
professor
james
weavers
of
the
indiana
university
law
school
and
assistant
attorney
general
robert
colder(ph).
may
it
please
the
court,
based
with
the
dilemma
concerning
jackson's
condition
as
described
by
the
petitioner
in
his
argument,
just
what
was
indiana
to
do.
indiana
had
three
alternatives,
indiana
could
try
jackson
anyway.
indiana
could
discharge
him
by
dismissing
the
criminal
charges
against
him
or
indiana
could
do
what
it
did
and
that
is
commitment
to
an
appropriate
psychiatric
and
rehabilitative
institution,
until
jackson
gained
the
necessary
comprehension
to
be
tried.
in
order
to
make
its
choice,
indiana
looked
at
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
found
that
in
pate
versus
robinson,
it
would
have
been
a
fourteenth
amendment
violation
to
try
jackson.
it
was
conceded
by
the
state
in
that
court
in
that
decision,
that
the
defendant
in
that
case
--
it
would
have
been
a
fourteenth
amendment
violation
to
try
him,
but
the
court
went
on
to
say
in
its
opinion
that
it
was
error
and
an
fourteenth
amendment
violation
for
the
court
not
to
give
the
defendant
in
that
case
a
competency
hearing
on
its
own
motion,
even
where
it
was
not
specifically
requested
by
counsel
in
pate
versus
robinson.
so
the
fourteenth
amendment
precluded
indiana
from
trying
jackson.
the
second
alternative
that
jackson
be
released
on
a
dismissal
of
the
criminal
charges
was
not
appealing
or
appropriate
to
indiana.
it
was
not
constitutionally
required
respondent
submits,
certainly
not
by
the
equal
protection
arguments
and
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
arguments
that
petitioner
makes
to
this
court
by
his
brief.
and
it
would
have
been
that
the
peace
in
dignity
of
indiana
was
offended
by
the
commission
of
the
two
robberies,
which
jackson
was
charged.
to
release
him
and
discharge
him
would
have
further
offended
the
state
and
would
have
offended
mrs.
farley
and
mrs.
lions.
the
alleged
victims
of
those
robberies.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
your
honor
the
state's
position
is
essentially
this
and
it
was
the
position
of
judge
arterburn
in
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
decision.
the
commitments
in
indiana
are
all
the
same.
there
is
no
criminal
commitment
as
such.
jackson
by
his
commitment
--
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
i
do
your
honor,
i
do.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
it
is
not,
it
would
be
for
life,
if
he
were
committed
under
any
statute
your
honor
if
he
is
not
going
to
recover.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
it's
non-comprehension
in
the
case
of
1917
06a
your
honor,
non-comprehension
in
the
case
of
the
commitments
statute
to
which
petitioner
would
have
a
commit.
the
standard
is
--
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
in
each
instance
and
the
superintendent
of
the
--
and
the
institution
your
honor
is
determined
on
the
basis
of
where
the
mental
health
--
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
yes
sir.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
he
would
stay
until
he
had
sufficient
--
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
until
–
if
the
test
is
your
honor
when
he
had
sufficient
mental
and
physical
capacity
to
the
satisfaction
of
superintendent
that's
a
paraphrase,
that
he'll
be
released.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
no
sir,
that
he
have
a
sufficient
comprehension
to
understand
the
nature
of
a
criminal
proceeding,
to
understand
the
charges
and
assistant
--
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
your
honor
let
me
submit
to
you
that
jackson
--
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
if
jackson
was
sane
and
tried
for
robbery,
robbery
carries
10
to
25
years
sentence
in
indiana.
and
he
is
charged
with
two
charges
of
robberies.
under
the
new
york
test
that
he
would
be--
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
by
force
and
violence
or
by
fear
your
honor
which
makes
it
robbery.
the
stealing
of
the
$4
is
not
--
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
your
honor
in
indiana,
if
a
man
by
force
and
violence
takes
$0.25
by
force
and
violence,
robbery
being
with
crime
against
the
person,
not
against
the
property.
he
is
subject
to
the
robbery
penalty
of
10
to
25
years.
no
matter
the
amount
of
money
or
the
value
of
the
property
involved.
not
so
for
largely
indiana.
indiana
has
the
$100
limit
on
felony
larceny
anything
under
$100
is
credit
larceny,
but
not
so
with
robbery.
robbery
doesn't
relate
to
the
value
of
taking.
so
that
we
see
that
pate
versus
robinson
would
not
let
indiana
try,
it
would
not
be
constitutionally
required
that
indiana
release
jackson,
and
the
third
proposition
that
he
be
committed
is
completely
within
the
decisions
of
this
court
so
far.
baxstrom
versus
herold
has
said
to
new
york
with
respect
to
the
commitment
of
the
baxstrom
that
you
cannot
procedurally
handle
baxstrom
any
different
from
any
other
potential
civil
committee
in
new
york.
baxstrom
nearing
the
end
of
a
criminal
penal
sentence
had
to
be
afforded
the
same
jury
trial
that
other
potential
civil
committees
were
afforded
in
new
york.
in
indiana,
jackson
is
given
the
same
due
process
hearing
with
respect
to
his
failure
to
have
comprehension
that
he
would
have
gotten
with
respect
to
a
22-1907
feeble-mindedness.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
no,
your
honor,
it's
an
alternative
argument.
we
are
saying,
if
insane
means
something,
the
same
as
9-1706
a,
non-comprehension
that
he
couldn't
have
been
committed
as
feeble-minded
but
it
is
equally
arguable
that
insane
does
not
mean
that,
that
insane
in
a
non-comprehension
statute
merely
means
that
you
don't
know
anything
about
a
criminal
case.
you
don't
understand
as
mr.
justice
marshall
pointed
out,
the
nature
of
a
criminal
case.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
no
sir,
no
sir
our
supreme
court
said,
quite
the
opposite.
our
supreme
court
said
that
jackson
could
go
to
muscatatuck
school
for
feeble
mind.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
by
the
department
and
the
vehicle
by
which
he
gets
there
is
precisely
what
mr.
justice
blackmun
was
pointing
out
to
the
counsel
for
the
petitioner,
that
some
responsible
citizen
in
the
county
in
which
jackson
resides
files
a
petition
for
civil
commitment.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
yes
your
honor.
but
i
submit
you
have
this
very
same
result
by
taking
that
fact
as
you
do
in
the
instant
case
because
he
is
committed
under
either
statute
to
the
department
of
mental
health,
at
the
discretion
of
the
commissioner's
placement.
he
isn't
precisely
--.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
muscatatuck.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
yes
sir,
absolutely.
absolutely,
the
indiana
supreme
court
decision
which
this
court
certainly
wants
to
pay
attention
to
says
in
interpreting
the
indiana
state
law,
that
jackson
can
go
anywhere,
any
mental
institution
is
the
language
at
the
discretion
of
the
commission
for
action
and
he
says
to
jackson
it's
not
for
you
to
say
mr.
jackson.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
it
comes,
if
i
understand
your
question
mr.
justice.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
yes,
that's
true.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
let
me
give
you
--
there
are
two
separate
proceedings
and
the
case
of
a
non-comprehension
commitment
as
we
have
in
the
instant
case.
the
court
on
the
suggestion,
that
he
may
not
have
sufficient
comprehension
appoints
two
physicians
to
examine
the
petitioner
and
report
to
the
court
there
is
a
full-blown
hearing
with
rights
of
petitioner
to
be
present,
cross
examine,
call
his
own
witnesses
which
he
did
in
this
case,
by
his
counsel
and
at
the
conclusion,
the
commitment
order
is
reviewable
by
the
appellate
court
of
indiana.
now
compare
it,
if
you
will
your
honor.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
well,
first
of
all,
how
can
there
be
a
hearing?
he
has
habeas
corpus
available
to
him.
presumably
if
his
treatment
is
not
right,
and
we
have
a
nason
type
situation,
he
can
file
a
habeas
corpus.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
he
could
file
a
habeas
corpus.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
he
could
file
a
habeas
corpus.
i
presume
that
he
would
also
have
the
opportunity
to
petition
the
court,
to
claim
that
he
is
now
sane.
he
could
do
it
better.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
yes,
but
he
could
do
it
better
because
he
attacks
the
discretion
of
the
superintendent
in
saying
that
he
is
not
and
therefore
he
is
being
illegally
detained
by
habeas
corpus,
your
honor.
that's
the
appropriate
remedy.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
jackson's
remedy
is
habeas
corpus.
if
jackson
is
saying.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
yes.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
yes,
he
would
your
honor,
both
in
state
court
and
in
federal.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
let
me
say
this,
your
honor.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
yes.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
no.
not
where
he
is
now.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
not
where
he
is
now.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
he
could
not
have
been
placed
in
central
state
hospital,
your
honor.
that
is
not
for
feeble-minded.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
yes.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
no
probably
not
because
it
isn’t
the
institution
that
carries
a
furlough
proposition.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
yes.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
yes,
that's
precisely
right.
but
it’s
because
of
the
nature
of
the
institution
not
the
nature
of
the
commitment.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
i
don't
know.
classically,
historically
central
state
hospital
was
for
more
serious
cases.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
no.
this
is
it.
this
is
a
case
of
personal
prejudice,
petitioner
would
have
say
it.
had
you
understand?
there
has
never
been
a
decision
in
indiana
that
someone
committed
for
non-comprehension
is
able
to
be
sent
to
muscatatuck,
but
it’s
reasonable
to
say
that
with
the
67
amendment
of
the
indiana
statute
that
equates
mental
institution
with
psychiatric
institution
and
makes
no
distinction
and
allows
the
commissioner
to
have
discretion
in
the
manner.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
that
would
be
my
understanding,
together
with
i
have
to
equivocate
your
honor.
i
would
think
he
would
be
in
a
position
to
petition
the
court,
the
committing
court
and
claim
his
sanity
whereas
there
are
nine
ways
to
get
into
mental
institutions,
nine
vehicles
by
this
indiana
statutory
scheme.
they
overlap,
they
repeal
that
my
implication,
they
supersede
in
part
but
in
spite
of
all
that
our
position
is
that
all
the
statutes
procedurally
treat
the
committee
alike
procedurally,
certainly
the
criteria
might
be
different
as
mr.
justice
marshall
pointed
out
to
me.
non
comprehension
in
the
one
instance
against
mentally
feeble-minded
and
needing
care
because
you
can’t
take
care
of
yourself.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
he
must
be
about
39
your
honor,
he
was
27
at
the
time
of
--
.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
yes.
now
let
me
take
the
edge
off
that
a
little
bit
mr.
justice.
he
has
two
pending
criminal
cases.
they
are
presently
pending
in
the
marion
criminal
court
in
indiana.
presumably
the
marion
criminal
court
judge
would
inquire
periodically
as
to
the
welfare
of
jackson
particularly
in
light
of
recent
history
and
the
need
to
suppose
of
cases,
group
cases.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
yes
sir.
and
it’s
interesting
to
note
that
the
new
york
statute
that
attempts
to
handle
the
problem
of
this
guy
say
that
the
criminal
charges
must
be
dismissed
if
length
of
time
to
be
in
a
commitment
is
more
than
two-thirds
of
the
sentence.
in
this
case
it
would
be
something
like
32-37
years.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
we
have
more,
your
honor.
we
have
more,
we
have
the
opportunity
for
jackson
to
periodically
petition
and
file
habeas
corpus.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
yeah.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
but
he
would
anyway.
that's
our
point.
he
would
anyway
under
the
civil
commitments
statute.
and
he
would
go
to
the
mental
health
department
under
those
statutes.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
yes,
your
honor,
but
i
might
point
out
that
it
only
became
--
it
came
to
the
attention
of
the
government,
of
the
state
government
by
these
criminal
charges.
i
would
submit
to
your
honor
that--
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
very
possible,
very
possible.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
he
says
that
in
his
own
case
that
his
condition
is
such
that
he
will
never
recover.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
your
honor,
it
requires
that
he
at
least
be
able
to
communicate
with
the
superintendent
or
someway
give
the
superintendent
reason
to
know
that
he
has
this
sufficient
mental
and
physical
ability
that
he
can
be
released.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
but
that
is
to
say
--
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
but
that
is
to
say
that
he
should
not
have
been
your
honor.
that
is
to
say
that
he
should
not
have
been.
he
has
the
intellect
of
a
three
or
four-year-old
child.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
he
has
the
intellect
of
--
i
would
be
derelict
in
my
responsibility
to
my
young
daughter,
if
i
placed
her
on
the
streets
of
indianapolis
your
honor.
the
same
way
as
the
state
would
be
derelict
to
this
person
who
has
the
intellect
of
three
or
four-year-old
child.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
yes
i
assume
so.
she
testified
the
case.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
no
sir
your
honor.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
that
might
be
an
act,
a
very
significant
argument.
i
think
probably
that's
what
this
case
is
all
about
your
honor.
in
some
other
case
other
than
jackson's
where
someone
just
didn't
know
about
the
criminal
case.
it
was
alright
in
every
other
respect
but
in
jackson's
case,
jackson
would
have
been
committed
any
way.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
because
it
would
be
redundant
your
honor.
he
is
--
under
the
same
sort
of
procedure
that
he
would
be
in
a
civil
commitment.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
that's
true.
but
if
--
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
the
commissioner
of
mental
health
i
submit
to
you
your
honor
could
make
that
determination
unilaterally
without
a
court,
it
could
transfer
jackson
to
his
muscatatuck.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
the
criteria
your
honor
--
the
criteria
in
order
to
meet
one
institution
or
another
is
determined
by
the
mental
health
commission.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
that
as
i
say
to
you
your
honor
that
would
be
significant
but
in
jackson's
case
with
the
condition
of
jackson
as
it's
been
described
here.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
i
would
have
to
recommend
the
civil
commitment
proceedings
be
started.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
if
he
were
transferred
to
muscatatuck,
we
probably
wouldn't
be
here
either
your
honor.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
but
that
is
probably
true,
that
is
probably
true
your
honor.
but
i
want
to
reemphasize
your
honor,
that
it
would
be
redundant
because
it
doesn't
matter,
under
which
statute,
he
goes
ultimately
to
the
commissioner
of
mental
health
of
indiana.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
i
know
of
no
other
case
personally
your
honor.
and
as
i
say,
the
jackson
case
decided
in
'71,
was
the
case
of
first
impression
with
respect
to
sending
people
to
muscatatuck,
under
the
non-comprehension
commitment.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
yes
sir,
because
of
the
nature
of
the
institution,
not
the
nature
of
the
commitment.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
no
i
don't,
no
i
haven't
your
honor.
the
decision
referring
you
to
the
appendix
of
page
26
of
judge
arterburn,
says
that
he
can't
be
though
your
honor,
he
can
be
so
transferred
to
muscatatuck.
this
9-1706
a,
non-comprehension
committee.
now,
we've
already
discussed
that,
greenwood
baxstrom,
williams
if
you
will
and
robinson
versus
california,
the
classic
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
cases,
would
not
preclude
indiana
from
taking
alternative
3,
the
commitment
alternative
that
it
does
now
because
that
as
was
pointed
out
by
mr.
justice
douglas
in
the
robinson
versus
california,
in
his
concurring
opinion.
it
is
not
the
confinement
which
amounts
to
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
it's
the
confinement
together
with
the
conviction
of
a
crime.
we
don't
have
that
in
this
situation.
in
closing,
let
me
submit
to
the
court,
that
the
indiana
treats
procedurally
all
potential
committees
alike,
whether
they
would
be
civil
committees
or
criminal
committees
as
designated
by
the
petitioner.
procedurally
alike,
admittedly
the
criteria
is
different.
baxstrom
does
not
require
that
the
criteria
be
the
same.
for
this
court
to
say
so
would
be
for
this
court
to
establish
a
test
for
insanity,
to
all
be
it
non-comprehension
in
indiana.
different
from
the
indiana
legislature's
definition
of
insanity,
for
purposes
of
non-comprehension,
and
classically,
the
sovereignty
of
indiana.
the
states
necessarily
treat
and
handle
they
are
insane.
the
same
as
they
do
with
respect
to
other
cases
that
are
strictly
the
states,
divorce,
marriage,
title
to
real
estate
and
insane.
and
the
indiana
legislature
has
adopted
the
non-comprehension
test.
for
this
court
to
say,
that
there
has
to
be
the
non-comprehension
test
plus
something
more
would
be
to
establish
a
different
test.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
only
if
the
charge
pending
against
him.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
pardon
me.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
no,
no
court
has
ever
decided
that.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
your
honor,
either
way,
it
that
doesn't
bear
on
his
being
able
to
go
in
muscatatuck,
the
charges,
that's
arterburn's
point.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
i
have
to
assume
your
honor
that
if
the
commissioner
acted
regularly
and
he'd
still
be
at
central
state,
no
matter
--
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
may
i
present
my
associates
at
the
counsel
table
with
me
professor
james
weavers
of
the
indiana
university
law
school
and
assistant
attorney
general
robert
colder(ph).
may
it
please
the
court,
based
with
the
dilemma
concerning
jackson's
condition
as
described
by
the
petitioner
in
his
argument,
just
what
was
indiana
to
do.
indiana
had
three
alternatives,
indiana
could
try
jackson
anyway.
indiana
could
discharge
him
by
dismissing
the
criminal
charges
against
him
or
indiana
could
do
what
it
did
and
that
is
commitment
to
an
appropriate
psychiatric
and
rehabilitative
institution,
until
jackson
gained
the
necessary
comprehension
to
be
tried.
in
order
to
make
its
choice,
indiana
looked
at
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
found
that
in
pate
versus
robinson,
it
would
have
been
a
fourteenth
amendment
violation
to
try
jackson.
it
was
conceded
by
the
state
in
that
court
in
that
decision,
that
the
defendant
in
that
case
--
it
would
have
been
a
fourteenth
amendment
violation
to
try
him,
but
the
court
went
on
to
say
in
its
opinion
that
it
was
error
and
an
fourteenth
amendment
violation
for
the
court
not
to
give
the
defendant
in
that
case
a
competency
hearing
on
its
own
motion,
even
where
it
was
not
specifically
requested
by
counsel
in
pate
versus
robinson.
so
the
fourteenth
amendment
precluded
indiana
from
trying
jackson.
the
second
alternative
that
jackson
be
released
on
a
dismissal
of
the
criminal
charges
was
not
appealing
or
appropriate
to
indiana.
it
was
not
constitutionally
required
respondent
submits,
certainly
not
by
the
equal
protection
arguments
and
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
arguments
that
petitioner
makes
to
this
court
by
his
brief.
and
it
would
have
been
that
the
peace
in
dignity
of
indiana
was
offended
by
the
commission
of
the
two
robberies,
which
jackson
was
charged.
to
release
him
and
discharge
him
would
have
further
offended
the
state
and
would
have
offended
mrs.
farley
and
mrs.
lions.
the
alleged
victims
of
those
robberies.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
your
honor
the
state's
position
is
essentially
this
and
it
was
the
position
of
judge
arterburn
in
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
decision.
the
commitments
in
indiana
are
all
the
same.
there
is
no
criminal
commitment
as
such.
jackson
by
his
commitment
--
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
i
do
your
honor,
i
do.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
it
is
not,
it
would
be
for
life,
if
he
were
committed
under
any
statute
your
honor
if
he
is
not
going
to
recover.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
it's
non-comprehension
in
the
case
of
1917
06a
your
honor,
non-comprehension
in
the
case
of
the
commitments
statute
to
which
petitioner
would
have
a
commit.
the
standard
is
--
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
in
each
instance
and
the
superintendent
of
the
--
and
the
institution
your
honor
is
determined
on
the
basis
of
where
the
mental
health
--
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
yes
sir.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
he
would
stay
until
he
had
sufficient
--
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
until
–
if
the
test
is
your
honor
when
he
had
sufficient
mental
and
physical
capacity
to
the
satisfaction
of
superintendent
that's
a
paraphrase,
that
he'll
be
released.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
no
sir,
that
he
have
a
sufficient
comprehension
to
understand
the
nature
of
a
criminal
proceeding,
to
understand
the
charges
and
assistant
--
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
your
honor
let
me
submit
to
you
that
jackson
--
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
if
jackson
was
sane
and
tried
for
robbery,
robbery
carries
10
to
25
years
sentence
in
indiana.
and
he
is
charged
with
two
charges
of
robberies.
under
the
new
york
test
that
he
would
be--
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
by
force
and
violence
or
by
fear
your
honor
which
makes
it
robbery.
the
stealing
of
the
$4
is
not
--
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
your
honor
in
indiana,
if
a
man
by
force
and
violence
takes
$0.25
by
force
and
violence,
robbery
being
with
crime
against
the
person,
not
against
the
property.
he
is
subject
to
the
robbery
penalty
of
10
to
25
years.
no
matter
the
amount
of
money
or
the
value
of
the
property
involved.
not
so
for
largely
indiana.
indiana
has
the
$100
limit
on
felony
larceny
anything
under
$100
is
credit
larceny,
but
not
so
with
robbery.
robbery
doesn't
relate
to
the
value
of
taking.
so
that
we
see
that
pate
versus
robinson
would
not
let
indiana
try,
it
would
not
be
constitutionally
required
that
indiana
release
jackson,
and
the
third
proposition
that
he
be
committed
is
completely
within
the
decisions
of
this
court
so
far.
baxstrom
versus
herold
has
said
to
new
york
with
respect
to
the
commitment
of
the
baxstrom
that
you
cannot
procedurally
handle
baxstrom
any
different
from
any
other
potential
civil
committee
in
new
york.
baxstrom
nearing
the
end
of
a
criminal
penal
sentence
had
to
be
afforded
the
same
jury
trial
that
other
potential
civil
committees
were
afforded
in
new
york.
in
indiana,
jackson
is
given
the
same
due
process
hearing
with
respect
to
his
failure
to
have
comprehension
that
he
would
have
gotten
with
respect
to
a
22-1907
feeble-mindedness.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
no,
your
honor,
it's
an
alternative
argument.
we
are
saying,
if
insane
means
something,
the
same
as
9-1706
a,
non-comprehension
that
he
couldn't
have
been
committed
as
feeble-minded
but
it
is
equally
arguable
that
insane
does
not
mean
that,
that
insane
in
a
non-comprehension
statute
merely
means
that
you
don't
know
anything
about
a
criminal
case.
you
don't
understand
as
mr.
justice
marshall
pointed
out,
the
nature
of
a
criminal
case.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
no
sir,
no
sir
our
supreme
court
said,
quite
the
opposite.
our
supreme
court
said
that
jackson
could
go
to
muscatatuck
school
for
feeble
mind.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
by
the
department
and
the
vehicle
by
which
he
gets
there
is
precisely
what
mr.
justice
blackmun
was
pointing
out
to
the
counsel
for
the
petitioner,
that
some
responsible
citizen
in
the
county
in
which
jackson
resides
files
a
petition
for
civil
commitment.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
yes
your
honor.
but
i
submit
you
have
this
very
same
result
by
taking
that
fact
as
you
do
in
the
instant
case
because
he
is
committed
under
either
statute
to
the
department
of
mental
health,
at
the
discretion
of
the
commissioner's
placement.
he
isn't
precisely
--.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
muscatatuck.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
yes
sir,
absolutely.
absolutely,
the
indiana
supreme
court
decision
which
this
court
certainly
wants
to
pay
attention
to
says
in
interpreting
the
indiana
state
law,
that
jackson
can
go
anywhere,
any
mental
institution
is
the
language
at
the
discretion
of
the
commission
for
action
and
he
says
to
jackson
it's
not
for
you
to
say
mr.
jackson.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
it
comes,
if
i
understand
your
question
mr.
justice.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
yes,
that's
true.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
let
me
give
you
--
there
are
two
separate
proceedings
and
the
case
of
a
non-comprehension
commitment
as
we
have
in
the
instant
case.
the
court
on
the
suggestion,
that
he
may
not
have
sufficient
comprehension
appoints
two
physicians
to
examine
the
petitioner
and
report
to
the
court
there
is
a
full-blown
hearing
with
rights
of
petitioner
to
be
present,
cross
examine,
call
his
own
witnesses
which
he
did
in
this
case,
by
his
counsel
and
at
the
conclusion,
the
commitment
order
is
reviewable
by
the
appellate
court
of
indiana.
now
compare
it,
if
you
will
your
honor.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
well,
first
of
all,
how
can
there
be
a
hearing?
he
has
habeas
corpus
available
to
him.
presumably
if
his
treatment
is
not
right,
and
we
have
a
nason
type
situation,
he
can
file
a
habeas
corpus.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
he
could
file
a
habeas
corpus.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
he
could
file
a
habeas
corpus.
i
presume
that
he
would
also
have
the
opportunity
to
petition
the
court,
to
claim
that
he
is
now
sane.
he
could
do
it
better.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
yes,
but
he
could
do
it
better
because
he
attacks
the
discretion
of
the
superintendent
in
saying
that
he
is
not
and
therefore
he
is
being
illegally
detained
by
habeas
corpus,
your
honor.
that's
the
appropriate
remedy.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
jackson's
remedy
is
habeas
corpus.
if
jackson
is
saying.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
yes.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
yes,
he
would
your
honor,
both
in
state
court
and
in
federal.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
let
me
say
this,
your
honor.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
yes.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
no.
not
where
he
is
now.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
not
where
he
is
now.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
he
could
not
have
been
placed
in
central
state
hospital,
your
honor.
that
is
not
for
feeble-minded.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
yes.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
no
probably
not
because
it
isn’t
the
institution
that
carries
a
furlough
proposition.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
yes.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
yes,
that's
precisely
right.
but
it’s
because
of
the
nature
of
the
institution
not
the
nature
of
the
commitment.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
i
don't
know.
classically,
historically
central
state
hospital
was
for
more
serious
cases.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
no.
this
is
it.
this
is
a
case
of
personal
prejudice,
petitioner
would
have
say
it.
had
you
understand?
there
has
never
been
a
decision
in
indiana
that
someone
committed
for
non-comprehension
is
able
to
be
sent
to
muscatatuck,
but
it’s
reasonable
to
say
that
with
the
67
amendment
of
the
indiana
statute
that
equates
mental
institution
with
psychiatric
institution
and
makes
no
distinction
and
allows
the
commissioner
to
have
discretion
in
the
manner.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
that
would
be
my
understanding,
together
with
i
have
to
equivocate
your
honor.
i
would
think
he
would
be
in
a
position
to
petition
the
court,
the
committing
court
and
claim
his
sanity
whereas
there
are
nine
ways
to
get
into
mental
institutions,
nine
vehicles
by
this
indiana
statutory
scheme.
they
overlap,
they
repeal
that
my
implication,
they
supersede
in
part
but
in
spite
of
all
that
our
position
is
that
all
the
statutes
procedurally
treat
the
committee
alike
procedurally,
certainly
the
criteria
might
be
different
as
mr.
justice
marshall
pointed
out
to
me.
non
comprehension
in
the
one
instance
against
mentally
feeble-minded
and
needing
care
because
you
can’t
take
care
of
yourself.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
he
must
be
about
39
your
honor,
he
was
27
at
the
time
of
--
.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
yes.
now
let
me
take
the
edge
off
that
a
little
bit
mr.
justice.
he
has
two
pending
criminal
cases.
they
are
presently
pending
in
the
marion
criminal
court
in
indiana.
presumably
the
marion
criminal
court
judge
would
inquire
periodically
as
to
the
welfare
of
jackson
particularly
in
light
of
recent
history
and
the
need
to
suppose
of
cases,
group
cases.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
yes
sir.
and
it’s
interesting
to
note
that
the
new
york
statute
that
attempts
to
handle
the
problem
of
this
guy
say
that
the
criminal
charges
must
be
dismissed
if
length
of
time
to
be
in
a
commitment
is
more
than
two-thirds
of
the
sentence.
in
this
case
it
would
be
something
like
32-37
years.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
we
have
more,
your
honor.
we
have
more,
we
have
the
opportunity
for
jackson
to
periodically
petition
and
file
habeas
corpus.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
yeah.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
but
he
would
anyway.
that's
our
point.
he
would
anyway
under
the
civil
commitments
statute.
and
he
would
go
to
the
mental
health
department
under
those
statutes.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
yes,
your
honor,
but
i
might
point
out
that
it
only
became
--
it
came
to
the
attention
of
the
government,
of
the
state
government
by
these
criminal
charges.
i
would
submit
to
your
honor
that--
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
very
possible,
very
possible.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
he
says
that
in
his
own
case
that
his
condition
is
such
that
he
will
never
recover.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
your
honor,
it
requires
that
he
at
least
be
able
to
communicate
with
the
superintendent
or
someway
give
the
superintendent
reason
to
know
that
he
has
this
sufficient
mental
and
physical
ability
that
he
can
be
released.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
but
that
is
to
say
--
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
but
that
is
to
say
that
he
should
not
have
been
your
honor.
that
is
to
say
that
he
should
not
have
been.
he
has
the
intellect
of
a
three
or
four-year-old
child.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
he
has
the
intellect
of
--
i
would
be
derelict
in
my
responsibility
to
my
young
daughter,
if
i
placed
her
on
the
streets
of
indianapolis
your
honor.
the
same
way
as
the
state
would
be
derelict
to
this
person
who
has
the
intellect
of
three
or
four-year-old
child.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
yes
i
assume
so.
she
testified
the
case.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
no
sir
your
honor.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
that
might
be
an
act,
a
very
significant
argument.
i
think
probably
that's
what
this
case
is
all
about
your
honor.
in
some
other
case
other
than
jackson's
where
someone
just
didn't
know
about
the
criminal
case.
it
was
alright
in
every
other
respect
but
in
jackson's
case,
jackson
would
have
been
committed
any
way.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
because
it
would
be
redundant
your
honor.
he
is
--
under
the
same
sort
of
procedure
that
he
would
be
in
a
civil
commitment.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
that's
true.
but
if
--
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
the
commissioner
of
mental
health
i
submit
to
you
your
honor
could
make
that
determination
unilaterally
without
a
court,
it
could
transfer
jackson
to
his
muscatatuck.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
the
criteria
your
honor
--
the
criteria
in
order
to
meet
one
institution
or
another
is
determined
by
the
mental
health
commission.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
that
as
i
say
to
you
your
honor
that
would
be
significant
but
in
jackson's
case
with
the
condition
of
jackson
as
it's
been
described
here.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
i
would
have
to
recommend
the
civil
commitment
proceedings
be
started.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
if
he
were
transferred
to
muscatatuck,
we
probably
wouldn't
be
here
either
your
honor.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
but
that
is
probably
true,
that
is
probably
true
your
honor.
but
i
want
to
reemphasize
your
honor,
that
it
would
be
redundant
because
it
doesn't
matter,
under
which
statute,
he
goes
ultimately
to
the
commissioner
of
mental
health
of
indiana.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
i
know
of
no
other
case
personally
your
honor.
and
as
i
say,
the
jackson
case
decided
in
'71,
was
the
case
of
first
impression
with
respect
to
sending
people
to
muscatatuck,
under
the
non-comprehension
commitment.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
yes
sir,
because
of
the
nature
of
the
institution,
not
the
nature
of
the
commitment.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
no
i
don't,
no
i
haven't
your
honor.
the
decision
referring
you
to
the
appendix
of
page
26
of
judge
arterburn,
says
that
he
can't
be
though
your
honor,
he
can
be
so
transferred
to
muscatatuck.
this
9-1706
a,
non-comprehension
committee.
now,
we've
already
discussed
that,
greenwood
baxstrom,
williams
if
you
will
and
robinson
versus
california,
the
classic
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
cases,
would
not
preclude
indiana
from
taking
alternative
3,
the
commitment
alternative
that
it
does
now
because
that
as
was
pointed
out
by
mr.
justice
douglas
in
the
robinson
versus
california,
in
his
concurring
opinion.
it
is
not
the
confinement
which
amounts
to
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
it's
the
confinement
together
with
the
conviction
of
a
crime.
we
don't
have
that
in
this
situation.
in
closing,
let
me
submit
to
the
court,
that
the
indiana
treats
procedurally
all
potential
committees
alike,
whether
they
would
be
civil
committees
or
criminal
committees
as
designated
by
the
petitioner.
procedurally
alike,
admittedly
the
criteria
is
different.
baxstrom
does
not
require
that
the
criteria
be
the
same.
for
this
court
to
say
so
would
be
for
this
court
to
establish
a
test
for
insanity,
to
all
be
it
non-comprehension
in
indiana.
different
from
the
indiana
legislature's
definition
of
insanity,
for
purposes
of
non-comprehension,
and
classically,
the
sovereignty
of
indiana.
the
states
necessarily
treat
and
handle
they
are
insane.
the
same
as
they
do
with
respect
to
other
cases
that
are
strictly
the
states,
divorce,
marriage,
title
to
real
estate
and
insane.
and
the
indiana
legislature
has
adopted
the
non-comprehension
test.
for
this
court
to
say,
that
there
has
to
be
the
non-comprehension
test
plus
something
more
would
be
to
establish
a
different
test.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
only
if
the
charge
pending
against
him.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
pardon
me.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
no,
no
court
has
ever
decided
that.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
your
honor,
either
way,
it
that
doesn't
bear
on
his
being
able
to
go
in
muscatatuck,
the
charges,
that's
arterburn's
point.
mr.
sheldon
a.
breskow
i
have
to
assume
your
honor
that
if
the
commissioner
acted
regularly
and
he'd
still
be
at
central
state,
no
matter
