we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
no.
5009,
jackson
against
indiana.
mr.
spencer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
it's
just
custodial
care,
not
treatment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
spencer
let
me
try
one
hypothetical
--
purely
hypothetical.
suppose
we
held
that
it
is
a
violation
of
due
process
in
these
circumstances
to
hold
such
a
person
as
your
client
in
confinement
in
an
institution
for
more
than
whatever
reasonable
time
is
required
to
determine
his
capacity
to
stand
trial.
the
expiration
of
that
reasonable
time,
he
must
be
civilly
committed
if
he
has
to
be
confined
at
all.
would
that
satisfy
your
problems?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
what
more
would
be
problem
than
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
just
take
the
things
i
pose.
that
we
said
after
reasonable
time
and
assume
also
add
to
the
hypothetical
that
we
would
say
that
nine
years
is
obviously
a
reasonable
time.
and
that
they
must
now
begin
proceedings
to
commit
him
civilly,
within
90
days
or
discharge
him
from
custody.
would
that
give
you
all
the
relief
you
wanted?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
else
do
you
want?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
he
is
going
out
in
90
days
unless,
on
this
hypothetical,
unless
civil
proceedings
are
commenced.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
90
days
i
have
said.
90
days
they
must
commence
the
civil
proceedings
within
90
days
or
discharge
him
from
custody,
haven't
you
got
then
all
the
relief
you
want?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
is
no
judgment
in
hypothetical,
i
have
given
you.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
merely
is
a
proceeding
and
if
they
can't
sustain
the
burden
of
proving
that
he
must
be
committed
civilly,
then
he
would
not
be
confined.
now
i
don't
know
what
your
standards
are
for
civil
commitment
in
detail,
or
what
the
practice
is,
but
you
don't
insist
that
they
dismiss
the
criminal
charges
as
part
of
this
process.
if
you
got
the
relief
i
am
talking
about
you,
do
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
you
know
that?
have
you
tried
that
remedy
that
justice
blackmun
has
suggested?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
they
get
paid
in
the
state
system?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
a
state
counterpart
of
the
criminal
justice
act?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it's
paid
by
the
state.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr
breskow.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
told
me
just
a
while
ago,
i
know
i
told
justice
brennan
that
if
this
man,
if
jackson
had
been
committed
as
the
feeble-minded
person,
the
department
of
mental
health,
could
still
have
placed
him
in
the
very
institution
where
he
is
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
breskow,
i
want
you
to
address
yourself
to
the
hypothetical
questions
i
put
to
your
friend.
namely,
what
would
the
state
of
the
indiana
do
now
if
hypothetically
this
court
says
due
process
requires
that
he
can
be
held
as
he
is
now
being
held
only
for
a
period
reasonably
long
enough
to
determine
whether
he
is
competent
to
stand
trial,
or
whether
forcibly
will
be
competent
to
stand
trial.
then
after
that,
he
must
be
released
unless
the
civil
commitment
is
started
within
90
days.
what
would
you
do
in
fact?
what
would
you
recommend?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
the
civil
commitment
proceeding
had
been
started,
let's
say
six
months
ago
or
a
year
ago
you
wouldn't
be
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
it
may
be
redundant
as
an
administrative
matter
but
perhaps
not
as
the
constitutional
problem.
and
that's
when
i
was
addressing
myself
to
and
you
had
answered
the
question.
