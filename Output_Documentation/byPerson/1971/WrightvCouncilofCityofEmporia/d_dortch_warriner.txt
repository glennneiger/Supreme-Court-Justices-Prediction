mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
at
the
outset,
it
might
be
well
to
remark
that
the
facts
is
found
by
the
district
court
and
by
the
court
of
appeals,
should
be
looked
to
for
a
determination
of
what
are
the
underlying
facts
in
this
case
rather
than
to
the
suspicions
expressed
by
counsel
at
the
bar.
and
in
this
connection,
i
would
point
to
page
318
of
the
joint
appendix
where
the
court
of
appeals
says,
“notably,
there
was
no
finding
of
discriminatory
purpose.”
and
instead,
the
quote
note
--
court
noted
its
satisfaction
that
the
city
would
if
permitted,
operate
its
own
system
on
a
unitary
basis.
obviously,
the
case
must
be
as
it
appears
rather
than
as
one
might
think
it
might
have
been.
we
have
listened
here
this
morning
to
the
scotland
neck
case
along
with
the
court,
and
that
if
we
may
express
an
opinion,
it
is
a
strong
case.
we
believe
because
of
certain
differences
of
substance
at
the
case
which
emporia
has
before
you
is
an
even
stronger
case.
in
the
emporia
case,
there
are
no
new
laws
involved.
there
is
no
chapter
31
(c).
the
city
of
emporia
is
not
in
existence
because
the
state
interposed
anything
as
they
did
in
scotland
neck.
emporia
is
in
existence
not
because
of
any
special
act
of
the
general
assembly
of
virginia,
but
is
in
existence
instead
because
it
has
followed
the
unique
pattern
of
independent
cities
which
has
existed
in
our
common
law
for
at
least
100
years.
when
the
town
of
emporia
in
the
summer
of
1967,
became
a
city,
automatically,
it
became
a
school
district.
no
additional
act
of
legislation,
no
additional
group
of
people
having
to
get
together
or
decide
anything.
automatically,
under
section
133
of
the
constitution
of
virginia,
the
city
of
emporia
became
a
separate
school
district.
it
became
a
separate
governmental
entity
for
all
purposes
other
than
those
related
to
the
circuit
court
of
the
--
in
the
circuit
of
which
it's
a
part,
that
is
the
sheriff,
commonwealth's
attorney
and
clerk
of
the
court.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
there
are
some
provisions
in
the
state
statutes
of
virginia
and
under
section
133
of
the
constitution
of
virginia
which
with
the
consent
of
two
governing
bodies,
two
independent
governing
bodies
such
as
two
cities
or
city
in
an
adjoining
county,
there
may
be
a
joint
school
board
in
which
both
the
city
and
the
county
as
the
case
might
be,
would
have
a
representation.
they
could
then
operate
a
joint
school
district.
absent
consent
from
both
governing
bodies,
there
is
no
provision
under
virginia
law
for
a
joint
school
district.
and
in
this
case,
as
the
evidence
shows,
the
county
of
greensville
which
would
be
the
logical
adjoining
county
refused
flatly
to
consent
to
any
joint
school
system.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
yes,
sir.
the
contract
provision
is
contained
in
section
20,
item
99
of
the
code
if
i
cited
correctly.
and
the
contract
provision
specifically
provides
that
even
in
the
event
of
a
contract,
that
the
city
must
have
a
representation
on
a
joint
school
board.
that
would
be
a
representation
from
each
magisterial
district
of
the
county
--
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
--
representation
from
--
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
1967
was
when
emporia
became
a
city.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
and
at
that
--
yes.
at
that
time,
the
city
of
emporia
elected
its
school
board
as
required
by
law,
and
as
the
fact
show,
considered
very
seriously
and
in-depth
the
determination
of
forming
its
own
school
system.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
because
of
problems
that
existed
at
that
time
largely
having
to
do
with
the
availability
of
school
buildings.
the
city
then
moved
to
the
next
choice
and
that
is
the
joint
school
board.
this
--
the
county
refused
and
so
the
city
in
april
of
1968
after
having
become
a
city
on
--
in
august
of
1967,
was
presented
with
an
ultimatum
from
the
county
saying,
“if
you
don't
sign
this
particular
contract
which
the
county
had
drawn,
without
change
and
do
it
by
the
30th
of
april,
your
children
will
be
expelled
from
our
schools.”
and,
under
those
circumstances,
a
contract
was
entered
into
which
in
the
opinion
of
counsel
was
a
void
and
illegal
contract
under
the
constitution
of
virginia.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
it
is
presently
before
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
no
decision.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
it
has
not
been
argued,
the
briefs
had
been
filed.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
the
lower
court
said
that
contracts
of
this,
i'll
try
to
quote,
“contracts
of
this
type
are
unconstitutional.
but,
since
a
necessity
existed
at
the
time
that
the
contract
was
entered
into,
the
court
will
not
hold
it
unconstitutional.”
this
was
the
opinion
of
the
lower
court
which
left
us
in
quite
a
contrary
--
contrary
as
you
can
imagine.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
that
is
correct.
once
a
town
has
passed
the
5000
point
in
population,
it
may
elect
to
become
a
city
by
merely
filing
a
census
with
the
court,
the
court
then
is
in
order
saying
it
is
now
a
city.
and
this
became
an
imperative
thing
for
the
towns
of
over
5000
in
virginia
to
do
in
1967
because
of
the
enactment
in
that
year,
the
state
sales
tax
which
returned
to
the
point
of
sale,
that
is
the
source,
one
cent
out
of
every
dollar
spent.
and
so
long
as
the
town
of
emporia
which
was
the
market
area
was
a
town,
and
then
the
money
was
being
returned
to
the
county
which
was
not
a
market
area.
since
it
became
a
city,
then
the
one
cent
was
returned
to
the
city.
and
that
was
why
the
haste
to
proceed
immediately
to
become
a
city
--
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
--
when
that
law
became
effective.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
no
allegation,
no
claim
and
no
finding.
and
this
is
again
a
--
a
somewhat
different
i
think
from
scotland
neck
in
which
there
were
some
allegations
to
that
effect.
also,
scotland
neck
is
still
a
part
of
halifax
county.
the
city
of
emporia
is
not
a
part
of
the
county
of
greensville.
it
is
not
a
part
of
it
for
any
purpose.
not
the
purpose
of
the
basic
school
levy
or
the
purpose
of
that
superimposed
school
or
for
any
other
purpose
other
than
as
i
mentioned
in
connection
with
the
circuit
court.
another
--
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
it
does.
in
our
particular
case,
it
covers
six
counties
--
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
--
and
two
cities.
another,
i
think
difference
which
made
way
in
their
balance
was
the
fact
that
in
the
city
of
emporia
with
its
separate
distinct
school
system.
there
will
be
no
schools
with
a
white
majority.
all
the
schools
will
be
with
a
black
majority.
actually,
i
think
for
purposes
of
argument,
we
generally
think
of
it
as
being
50:50
but
that
at
the
time
of
1969,
the
ratio
would
have
been
52%
black,
48%
white
and
i
think
the
chief
justice
asked
what
the
present
figures
were
and
they
would
be
if
--
and
care
to
have
them
55%
black
and
45%
white
if
the
school
were
in
existence
at
the
present
time.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
the
city
school
system
would
be
55%
black
and
45%
white
as
of
this
school
year.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
that's
correct.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
all
through
the
city
school
system
because
you
see,
we
would
have
the
simplest
type
of
unitary
system.
we
would
have
one
elementary
school
building
into
which
all
elementary
children
would
go.
we
would
have
one
high
school
building
into
which
all
high
school
children
would
go.
we
would
have
for
all
practical
purposes
the
most
perfect
integration
of
schools
that
one
could
seek
anywhere.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
that
is
correct.
and
we
also
envision
and
is
an
evidence,
a
special
program
in
hope
to
forbid
drop
outs.
an
enhancement
program,
aims
specifically
at
the
mentioned
drop
outs.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
the
district
court
plan
was
to
go
into
effect
in
the
fall
of
1969.
it
was
decided
in
june
of
1969
effective
that
fall.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
did
it
go
into
effect?
oh,
yes,
sir.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
i'm
sorry.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
that's
correct.
and
the
schools
at
the
present
time,
just
simply
are
not
racially
identifiable.
for
the
past
three
years,
the
majority
of
blacks
in
all
of
the
schools
of
the
county
has
been
roughly
two-to-three-to-one.
and
that's
--
would
be
in
schools
that
might
be
characterized
as
formally
all
white.
they're
all
now
with
a
black
majority
and
they
will
be
with
the
black
majority
after
the
city
is
permitted
to
proceed
with
its
unitary
school
plan.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
as
of
this
school
year.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
in
fact,
now,
the
ratio
is
66%
black,
34%
white.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
that's
--
yes.
that's
because
the
entire
system
of
greensville
county
with
the
city
of
emporia
combined
would
give
you
a
ratio
of
66
black
to
34
white.
if
the
city
were
proceeding
in
its
own
system,
it
would
be
--
the
city
would
be
55%
black,
45%
white
like
a
remaining
county,
would
be
a
change
from
66%
combined
to
71%
if
it
were
by
itself.
and
the
city
--
the
county
would
have
29%
white
to
go
by
itself.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
within
the
city?
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
there
is
a
school
on
--
at
greensville
county
training
school
which
is
located
on
the
edge
of
the
city,
the
north
eastern
edge
of
the
city.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
we
do
not
desire,
the
county
needs
it
and
would
use
it.
in
our
suit,
what
we
call
the
equity
suit
which
is
our
suit
to
allocate
to
the
city
that
which
it
is
entitled
to
have
upon
the
transition
from
a
town
to
a
city,
we
have
asked
that
for
an
event
which
we
need
it
and
no
more.
and
we
need
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
school
children
in
the
city,
an
elementary
school
building
and
a
high
school
building.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
none.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
none.
no,
sir.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
no,
sir.
not
unless
the
district
court
says
so.
and
on
that
--
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
none.
none,
sir.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
it
--
it
presents
a
problem
because
--
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
no.
now,
each
body
then
--
each
governmental
body
has
to
raise
its
proportionate
share
which
is
generally
a
contractual
share
of
the
combined
budget,
and
the
problem
exist
because
one
body
or
the
other
may
want
to
spend
more
or
less
than
the
other.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
and
we
don't
have
--
excuse
me.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
yes,
your
honor.
one
for
each
award
and
there
happen
to
be
four
awards
in
the
city
of
emporia
but
there's
no
reason
why
we
couldn't
have
more
awards
than
that
or
less
awards
than
that
which
again
leads
to
awkwardness
in
the
--
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
--
in
their
ruling.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
i
would
suspect
in
all
fairness
that
the
county
should
have
voting
control
of
the
joint
board
because
its
population
is
roughly
two-to-one
that
of
the
city.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
no,
your
honor,
they
did
not.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
it's
not
in
the
record
and
so
far
as
i
know,
they
didn't
give
a
reason.
they
just
said
they
weren't
going
to
do
it
which
is
not
contrary
to
the
usual
cause
of
affairs
between
the
city
of
emporia
and
the
county
of
greensville,
it's
part
of
the
pattern.
and
it's
part
of
the
reason
we're
here,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it's
--
it's
the
overwhelming
reason
if
they're
here.
this
case
is
not
the
usual
zoning
case
with
which
you
have
dealt
before
as
you
can
readily
see.
the
zoning
case
involves
one
government
which
is
dividing
itself
up
into
attendance
zones.
that's
not
the
case
here.
we're
talking
about
two
governments.
the
--
the
populace
of
one
having
no
voice
whatever
in
the
operations
of
the
other.
and
since
the
stay
of
the
court
--
the
district
court's
order,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
since
1967,
the
children
of
the
city
of
emporia
had
been
educated
in
the
school
system
over
which
their
parents
who
are
taxpayers
and
their
city
council
and
their
city
school
board
has
had
not
one
item
or
(inaudible)
of
control.
this
of
course
is
contrary
to
the
whole
american
idea
of
how
government
ought
to
be
one.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
no,
it
did
not,
your
honor.
that
is
a
state
court
matter
and
it's
under
the
state
law
that
it's
illegal.
however,
i
think
that
certainly,
that's
a
federal
question
with
all
--
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
no,
your
honor.
it's
exactly
as
--
as
i've
just
stated
it.
our
children
go
to
a
school
system
over
which
we
have
no
control.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
we
have
to
pay
--
the
order
said
that
we
should
pay
out
“proportionate
or
proper
share.”
and
we
are
now
paying
a
share
which
we
unilaterally
determined
to
be
appropriate
and
proper
and
that
is
we
took
the
local
effort
and
divided
it
by
the
total
number
of
children
in
the
school
system
and
we're
paying
on
a
per
capita
basis.
this
involves
problems
of
careful
expenditures
which
are
difficult
to
rule
out
and
certainly,
we
don't
owe
anything
for
capital
expenditures.
but
this
is
the
most
anomalous
situation
that
we're
in
under
the
present
situation
and
it
gives
ample
justification
of
what
we
are
seeking
to
do.
no
governing
body,
no
people
would
want
the
most
important
aspect
of
local
government
to
be
completely
out
of
their
control
as
it
is
in
--
in
the
city
of
montgomery.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
since
june
the
25th
of
1969
when
it
was
entered
by
the
district
court.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
the
city
has
been
appropriating
funds?
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
oh,
yes.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
well,
it
involves
bussing
of
city
children
out
into
the
county
to
county
schools
and
the
city
has
had
to
pay
its
proportionate
share
of
that.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
that
is
correct.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
if
your
honor
please,
there's
a
difference
between
carrying
out
the
mechanics
of
a
plan
and
carrying
out
the
spirit
of
a
plan.
and
it
is
our
position
then
and
our
position
now
that
the
spirit
and
the
will
which
must
go
into
a
unitary
system
of
education
to
work
is
lacking,
and
if
it
is
not
lacking
in
the
city.
the
city
may
have
delayed
long
in
trying
to
pick
up
the
beat
of
the
drum
but
they
picked
it
up
and
they
went
to
march.
and
i
--
i
respectfully
submit
that
we
should
be
seeking
in
obtaining
the
help
of
our
adversaries
here
at
the
bar
rather
than
their
obstruction
because
we
have
sought
and
seek
now
to
implement
a
realistic,
workable
unitary
system.
we
know
that
it
can
work
and
it
will
work
if
given
the
altitude
--
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
that
is
in
error.
we
do
not
have
a
transfer
plan.
may
i
explain
that
a
bit?
at
the
time
that
we
first
proposed
operating
our
independent
school
system,
as
a
part
of
our
hope
of
persuading
the
county
to
do
that
which
it
ought
to
do
and
that
is
turned
over
to
us,
the
school
buildings
which
rightfully
should
be
ours,
we
included
on
a
first
come,
first
serve,
no
transportation
basis
on
tuition,
the
opportunity
for
anyone
who
wanted
to
attend
a
city
school
system
to
attend
it.
the
district
court
expressed
doubt
about
the
validity
of
that.
we
said
very
well
and
if
there
is
any
question
about
it,
if
that
shows
any
casting
of
doubt
upon
our
good
faith,
we
freely
and
willingly
give
it
up,
and
we
have.
i
think
that
we
have
to
view
this
case
conceptually
by
going
back
to
the
basics.
what
constitutional
right
has
been
violated?
now,
no
constitutional
right
admittedly
was
violated
at
the
time
the
town
of
emporia
became
a
city
in
1967.
and
so,
if
a
right
has
been
violated,
it
had
to
be
violated
as
a
result
of
having
a
separate
school
system
flowing
from
the
city
status.
and
you
look
at
the
school
system
and
you
see
that
there
is
a
completely
and
wholly
unitary
system
in
the
city
of
emporia.
you
look
if
you
will
at
the
county
school
system
and
you
see
a
complete
and
wholly
unitary
school
system
in
the
county.nothing
artificial
in
either
case,
nothing
forced,
nothing
temporarily
expedient
in
order
to
obtain
some
particular
boundaries.
but
the
natural
consequences
of
non-state
action
result
in
two
separate
school
units,
each
having
within
it
a
unitary
system,
each
with
no
predominance
of
one
race
over
the
other,
but
each
representing
the
community
which
it
intended
to
serve.
now,
if
--
if
there
is
a
constitutional
right
involved,
it
must
be
a
constitutional
right
to
a
specified
ratio
because
we're
not
damaging
any
other
right.
that
must
be
a
right
to
a
specified
ratio
in
some
geographic
area.
we
submit
that
swann
didn't
say
that,
green
didn't
say
that,
and
spencer
against
kugler
decided
by
this
court
in
january
did
not
say
that.
where
there
is
no
showing
of
state
action
which
produced
a
ratio
pattern
in
a
community
and
certainly
inside
of
south
virginia
based
no
racial
pattern.
there
is
a
--
it
is
a
completely
intermixed
community.
no
one
in
emporia
lives
over
three
blocks
from
someone
of
a
different
race.he
just
--
it's
just
that
way.
so,
not
only
is
no
state
action
creating
a
racial
pattern,
it
doesn't
exist
just
as
in
kugler.
just
as
in
kugler,
the
boundary
lines
of
the
city
of
emporia
were
not
drawn
in
an
attempt
to
gerrymander
in
or
out
anyone.
and
when
i
mentioned
that,
i'm
reminded
of
the
fact
that
enclosing
counsel
for
the
plaintiffs
mentioned
something
about
75%
of
the
children
being
included
out.
25%
of
his
plans
are
included
in
a
substantially
better
system
which
is
the
uncontradicted
evidence
in
this
case.
and
certainly,
they
are
entitled
to
rights
where
a
unitary
school
system
can
bring
about
a
better
school
system,
then
it
ought
to
be
implemented
too
often.
i
feel
assure
you
have
the
arguments
before
you
that
the
unitary
school
system
is
going
to
bring
about
a
poorer
school
system.
this
is
just
an
opposite
of
that
argument
and
it
is
a
sincere
argument.
and
it
is
an
argument
which
is
not
contradicted
in
the
evidence.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
evidence
is
conclusive
to
the
effect
found
by
the
district
court.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
--
the
record
which
we
have
presented
to
you
is
abundantly
clear
that
the
problem
of
having
a
separate
--
the
desire
to
have
a
separate
school
system
for
the
city
of
emporia
just
as
every
other
city
in
--
in
virginia
has,
has
been
one
of
the
long
standing.
the
dissatisfaction
with
the
arrangement
that
we've
had
with
the
county
is
one
that
is
ingrained.
the
ameliorative
influence
that
you
have
suggested
of
having
representation
on
the
board
proportionate
would
not
cure
the
problems
that
existed
--
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
yes
--
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
it
--
it
was
offered
--
we
offered
to
do
it,
if
your
honor
please,
because
--
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
well,
we
first
say
it's
been
withdrawn.
but
second,
we'd
say
we've
got
something
better.
we've
got
our
--
we've
got
what
we
think
is
--
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
the
experience
that
we've
had
with
the
county
has
changed
our
mind
and
the
case
of
green,
the
(inaudible)
has
changed
our
minds.
i
say
that
without
blanching
at
it
at
all
because
a
county
could
operate
a
reasonably
good
school
system
under
the
circumstances
that
existed
prior
to
green.
they
had
no
will
to
implement
green.
they
had
no
desire
to
implement
green
and
this
is
what
the
evidence
shows.
i'm
not
stating
my
view,
the
evidence
shows
that,
apathy
with
respect
to
green.
the
evidence
shows
that
they,
post-green,
didn't
increase
their
budget
even
and
have
to
take
care
of
inflation.
and
yet,
the
needs
that
arise,
post-green,
a
far
and
greater
than
the
pre-green
leaves.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
insofar
as
race
is
concerned?
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
there
are
four
people
on
this
county
--
county
school
board,
three
of
them
are
white
and
one
of
them
is
black.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
population
of
the
county
is
above
9000.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
roughly,
50:50.
i
think
that
i'm
correct
in
saying
it's
four.
any
--
any
event,
it's
the
four
or
five
and
one
of
them
was
black.
i
think
it's
four.
if
there
is
anything
in
the
decision
of
swann
with
respect
to
the
problem
of
flexibility,
that
problem
being
met
by
flexibility
that
the
school
boards
have
plenary
power
provided,
there
is
no
invidious
discrimination.
then,
this
is
a
case
to
imply
--
to
apply
the
language
of
swann.
this
is
a
case
where
a
city
has
undertaken
its
obligation
under
brown
and
has
asked
and
fought
for
the
right
through
the
courts
to
provide
a
realistic
unitary
school
system
to
--
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
if
it
is
a
factor
in
this
case,
it's
a
most
muted
one.
we
have
an
area
that
is
already
a
municipality
--
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
they
didn't
make
any
observation
on
that
that
i
can
recall.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
nor
did
the
district
court.
there
was
discussion
of
the
fact
that
a
good
school
system
would
help
make
a
viable
growing
community
which
would
include
growth,
white
and
black.
but,
so
far
as
i
can
recall,
neither
the
district
court
nor
the
court
of
appeals
addressed
itself
to
white
flight
and
insofar
as
i
can
recall,
neither
did
our
evidence.
however,
i
think
it's
obvious
that
the
better
the
school
system,
the
more
people
will
stay
in
it,
white
and
black.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
we
have
managed
to
keep
them
out
of
our
county
and
city
up
to
now.
i
hope
we
can
always
do
that.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
at
the
outset,
it
might
be
well
to
remark
that
the
facts
is
found
by
the
district
court
and
by
the
court
of
appeals,
should
be
looked
to
for
a
determination
of
what
are
the
underlying
facts
in
this
case
rather
than
to
the
suspicions
expressed
by
counsel
at
the
bar.
and
in
this
connection,
i
would
point
to
page
318
of
the
joint
appendix
where
the
court
of
appeals
says,
“notably,
there
was
no
finding
of
discriminatory
purpose.”
and
instead,
the
quote
note
--
court
noted
its
satisfaction
that
the
city
would
if
permitted,
operate
its
own
system
on
a
unitary
basis.
obviously,
the
case
must
be
as
it
appears
rather
than
as
one
might
think
it
might
have
been.
we
have
listened
here
this
morning
to
the
scotland
neck
case
along
with
the
court,
and
that
if
we
may
express
an
opinion,
it
is
a
strong
case.
we
believe
because
of
certain
differences
of
substance
at
the
case
which
emporia
has
before
you
is
an
even
stronger
case.
in
the
emporia
case,
there
are
no
new
laws
involved.
there
is
no
chapter
31
(c).
the
city
of
emporia
is
not
in
existence
because
the
state
interposed
anything
as
they
did
in
scotland
neck.
emporia
is
in
existence
not
because
of
any
special
act
of
the
general
assembly
of
virginia,
but
is
in
existence
instead
because
it
has
followed
the
unique
pattern
of
independent
cities
which
has
existed
in
our
common
law
for
at
least
100
years.
when
the
town
of
emporia
in
the
summer
of
1967,
became
a
city,
automatically,
it
became
a
school
district.
no
additional
act
of
legislation,
no
additional
group
of
people
having
to
get
together
or
decide
anything.
automatically,
under
section
133
of
the
constitution
of
virginia,
the
city
of
emporia
became
a
separate
school
district.
it
became
a
separate
governmental
entity
for
all
purposes
other
than
those
related
to
the
circuit
court
of
the
--
in
the
circuit
of
which
it's
a
part,
that
is
the
sheriff,
commonwealth's
attorney
and
clerk
of
the
court.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
there
are
some
provisions
in
the
state
statutes
of
virginia
and
under
section
133
of
the
constitution
of
virginia
which
with
the
consent
of
two
governing
bodies,
two
independent
governing
bodies
such
as
two
cities
or
city
in
an
adjoining
county,
there
may
be
a
joint
school
board
in
which
both
the
city
and
the
county
as
the
case
might
be,
would
have
a
representation.
they
could
then
operate
a
joint
school
district.
absent
consent
from
both
governing
bodies,
there
is
no
provision
under
virginia
law
for
a
joint
school
district.
and
in
this
case,
as
the
evidence
shows,
the
county
of
greensville
which
would
be
the
logical
adjoining
county
refused
flatly
to
consent
to
any
joint
school
system.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
yes,
sir.
the
contract
provision
is
contained
in
section
20,
item
99
of
the
code
if
i
cited
correctly.
and
the
contract
provision
specifically
provides
that
even
in
the
event
of
a
contract,
that
the
city
must
have
a
representation
on
a
joint
school
board.
that
would
be
a
representation
from
each
magisterial
district
of
the
county
--
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
--
representation
from
--
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
1967
was
when
emporia
became
a
city.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
and
at
that
--
yes.
at
that
time,
the
city
of
emporia
elected
its
school
board
as
required
by
law,
and
as
the
fact
show,
considered
very
seriously
and
in-depth
the
determination
of
forming
its
own
school
system.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
because
of
problems
that
existed
at
that
time
largely
having
to
do
with
the
availability
of
school
buildings.
the
city
then
moved
to
the
next
choice
and
that
is
the
joint
school
board.
this
--
the
county
refused
and
so
the
city
in
april
of
1968
after
having
become
a
city
on
--
in
august
of
1967,
was
presented
with
an
ultimatum
from
the
county
saying,
“if
you
don't
sign
this
particular
contract
which
the
county
had
drawn,
without
change
and
do
it
by
the
30th
of
april,
your
children
will
be
expelled
from
our
schools.”
and,
under
those
circumstances,
a
contract
was
entered
into
which
in
the
opinion
of
counsel
was
a
void
and
illegal
contract
under
the
constitution
of
virginia.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
it
is
presently
before
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
no
decision.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
it
has
not
been
argued,
the
briefs
had
been
filed.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
the
lower
court
said
that
contracts
of
this,
i'll
try
to
quote,
“contracts
of
this
type
are
unconstitutional.
but,
since
a
necessity
existed
at
the
time
that
the
contract
was
entered
into,
the
court
will
not
hold
it
unconstitutional.”
this
was
the
opinion
of
the
lower
court
which
left
us
in
quite
a
contrary
--
contrary
as
you
can
imagine.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
that
is
correct.
once
a
town
has
passed
the
5000
point
in
population,
it
may
elect
to
become
a
city
by
merely
filing
a
census
with
the
court,
the
court
then
is
in
order
saying
it
is
now
a
city.
and
this
became
an
imperative
thing
for
the
towns
of
over
5000
in
virginia
to
do
in
1967
because
of
the
enactment
in
that
year,
the
state
sales
tax
which
returned
to
the
point
of
sale,
that
is
the
source,
one
cent
out
of
every
dollar
spent.
and
so
long
as
the
town
of
emporia
which
was
the
market
area
was
a
town,
and
then
the
money
was
being
returned
to
the
county
which
was
not
a
market
area.
since
it
became
a
city,
then
the
one
cent
was
returned
to
the
city.
and
that
was
why
the
haste
to
proceed
immediately
to
become
a
city
--
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
--
when
that
law
became
effective.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
no
allegation,
no
claim
and
no
finding.
and
this
is
again
a
--
a
somewhat
different
i
think
from
scotland
neck
in
which
there
were
some
allegations
to
that
effect.
also,
scotland
neck
is
still
a
part
of
halifax
county.
the
city
of
emporia
is
not
a
part
of
the
county
of
greensville.
it
is
not
a
part
of
it
for
any
purpose.
not
the
purpose
of
the
basic
school
levy
or
the
purpose
of
that
superimposed
school
or
for
any
other
purpose
other
than
as
i
mentioned
in
connection
with
the
circuit
court.
another
--
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
it
does.
in
our
particular
case,
it
covers
six
counties
--
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
--
and
two
cities.
another,
i
think
difference
which
made
way
in
their
balance
was
the
fact
that
in
the
city
of
emporia
with
its
separate
distinct
school
system.
there
will
be
no
schools
with
a
white
majority.
all
the
schools
will
be
with
a
black
majority.
actually,
i
think
for
purposes
of
argument,
we
generally
think
of
it
as
being
50:50
but
that
at
the
time
of
1969,
the
ratio
would
have
been
52%
black,
48%
white
and
i
think
the
chief
justice
asked
what
the
present
figures
were
and
they
would
be
if
--
and
care
to
have
them
55%
black
and
45%
white
if
the
school
were
in
existence
at
the
present
time.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
the
city
school
system
would
be
55%
black
and
45%
white
as
of
this
school
year.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
that's
correct.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
all
through
the
city
school
system
because
you
see,
we
would
have
the
simplest
type
of
unitary
system.
we
would
have
one
elementary
school
building
into
which
all
elementary
children
would
go.
we
would
have
one
high
school
building
into
which
all
high
school
children
would
go.
we
would
have
for
all
practical
purposes
the
most
perfect
integration
of
schools
that
one
could
seek
anywhere.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
that
is
correct.
and
we
also
envision
and
is
an
evidence,
a
special
program
in
hope
to
forbid
drop
outs.
an
enhancement
program,
aims
specifically
at
the
mentioned
drop
outs.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
the
district
court
plan
was
to
go
into
effect
in
the
fall
of
1969.
it
was
decided
in
june
of
1969
effective
that
fall.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
did
it
go
into
effect?
oh,
yes,
sir.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
i'm
sorry.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
that's
correct.
and
the
schools
at
the
present
time,
just
simply
are
not
racially
identifiable.
for
the
past
three
years,
the
majority
of
blacks
in
all
of
the
schools
of
the
county
has
been
roughly
two-to-three-to-one.
and
that's
--
would
be
in
schools
that
might
be
characterized
as
formally
all
white.
they're
all
now
with
a
black
majority
and
they
will
be
with
the
black
majority
after
the
city
is
permitted
to
proceed
with
its
unitary
school
plan.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
as
of
this
school
year.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
in
fact,
now,
the
ratio
is
66%
black,
34%
white.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
that's
--
yes.
that's
because
the
entire
system
of
greensville
county
with
the
city
of
emporia
combined
would
give
you
a
ratio
of
66
black
to
34
white.
if
the
city
were
proceeding
in
its
own
system,
it
would
be
--
the
city
would
be
55%
black,
45%
white
like
a
remaining
county,
would
be
a
change
from
66%
combined
to
71%
if
it
were
by
itself.
and
the
city
--
the
county
would
have
29%
white
to
go
by
itself.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
within
the
city?
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
there
is
a
school
on
--
at
greensville
county
training
school
which
is
located
on
the
edge
of
the
city,
the
north
eastern
edge
of
the
city.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
we
do
not
desire,
the
county
needs
it
and
would
use
it.
in
our
suit,
what
we
call
the
equity
suit
which
is
our
suit
to
allocate
to
the
city
that
which
it
is
entitled
to
have
upon
the
transition
from
a
town
to
a
city,
we
have
asked
that
for
an
event
which
we
need
it
and
no
more.
and
we
need
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
school
children
in
the
city,
an
elementary
school
building
and
a
high
school
building.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
none.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
none.
no,
sir.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
no,
sir.
not
unless
the
district
court
says
so.
and
on
that
--
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
none.
none,
sir.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
it
--
it
presents
a
problem
because
--
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
no.
now,
each
body
then
--
each
governmental
body
has
to
raise
its
proportionate
share
which
is
generally
a
contractual
share
of
the
combined
budget,
and
the
problem
exist
because
one
body
or
the
other
may
want
to
spend
more
or
less
than
the
other.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
and
we
don't
have
--
excuse
me.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
yes,
your
honor.
one
for
each
award
and
there
happen
to
be
four
awards
in
the
city
of
emporia
but
there's
no
reason
why
we
couldn't
have
more
awards
than
that
or
less
awards
than
that
which
again
leads
to
awkwardness
in
the
--
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
--
in
their
ruling.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
i
would
suspect
in
all
fairness
that
the
county
should
have
voting
control
of
the
joint
board
because
its
population
is
roughly
two-to-one
that
of
the
city.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
no,
your
honor,
they
did
not.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
it's
not
in
the
record
and
so
far
as
i
know,
they
didn't
give
a
reason.
they
just
said
they
weren't
going
to
do
it
which
is
not
contrary
to
the
usual
cause
of
affairs
between
the
city
of
emporia
and
the
county
of
greensville,
it's
part
of
the
pattern.
and
it's
part
of
the
reason
we're
here,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it's
--
it's
the
overwhelming
reason
if
they're
here.
this
case
is
not
the
usual
zoning
case
with
which
you
have
dealt
before
as
you
can
readily
see.
the
zoning
case
involves
one
government
which
is
dividing
itself
up
into
attendance
zones.
that's
not
the
case
here.
we're
talking
about
two
governments.
the
--
the
populace
of
one
having
no
voice
whatever
in
the
operations
of
the
other.
and
since
the
stay
of
the
court
--
the
district
court's
order,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
since
1967,
the
children
of
the
city
of
emporia
had
been
educated
in
the
school
system
over
which
their
parents
who
are
taxpayers
and
their
city
council
and
their
city
school
board
has
had
not
one
item
or
(inaudible)
of
control.
this
of
course
is
contrary
to
the
whole
american
idea
of
how
government
ought
to
be
one.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
no,
it
did
not,
your
honor.
that
is
a
state
court
matter
and
it's
under
the
state
law
that
it's
illegal.
however,
i
think
that
certainly,
that's
a
federal
question
with
all
--
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
no,
your
honor.
it's
exactly
as
--
as
i've
just
stated
it.
our
children
go
to
a
school
system
over
which
we
have
no
control.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
we
have
to
pay
--
the
order
said
that
we
should
pay
out
“proportionate
or
proper
share.”
and
we
are
now
paying
a
share
which
we
unilaterally
determined
to
be
appropriate
and
proper
and
that
is
we
took
the
local
effort
and
divided
it
by
the
total
number
of
children
in
the
school
system
and
we're
paying
on
a
per
capita
basis.
this
involves
problems
of
careful
expenditures
which
are
difficult
to
rule
out
and
certainly,
we
don't
owe
anything
for
capital
expenditures.
but
this
is
the
most
anomalous
situation
that
we're
in
under
the
present
situation
and
it
gives
ample
justification
of
what
we
are
seeking
to
do.
no
governing
body,
no
people
would
want
the
most
important
aspect
of
local
government
to
be
completely
out
of
their
control
as
it
is
in
--
in
the
city
of
montgomery.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
since
june
the
25th
of
1969
when
it
was
entered
by
the
district
court.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
the
city
has
been
appropriating
funds?
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
oh,
yes.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
well,
it
involves
bussing
of
city
children
out
into
the
county
to
county
schools
and
the
city
has
had
to
pay
its
proportionate
share
of
that.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
that
is
correct.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
if
your
honor
please,
there's
a
difference
between
carrying
out
the
mechanics
of
a
plan
and
carrying
out
the
spirit
of
a
plan.
and
it
is
our
position
then
and
our
position
now
that
the
spirit
and
the
will
which
must
go
into
a
unitary
system
of
education
to
work
is
lacking,
and
if
it
is
not
lacking
in
the
city.
the
city
may
have
delayed
long
in
trying
to
pick
up
the
beat
of
the
drum
but
they
picked
it
up
and
they
went
to
march.
and
i
--
i
respectfully
submit
that
we
should
be
seeking
in
obtaining
the
help
of
our
adversaries
here
at
the
bar
rather
than
their
obstruction
because
we
have
sought
and
seek
now
to
implement
a
realistic,
workable
unitary
system.
we
know
that
it
can
work
and
it
will
work
if
given
the
altitude
--
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
that
is
in
error.
we
do
not
have
a
transfer
plan.
may
i
explain
that
a
bit?
at
the
time
that
we
first
proposed
operating
our
independent
school
system,
as
a
part
of
our
hope
of
persuading
the
county
to
do
that
which
it
ought
to
do
and
that
is
turned
over
to
us,
the
school
buildings
which
rightfully
should
be
ours,
we
included
on
a
first
come,
first
serve,
no
transportation
basis
on
tuition,
the
opportunity
for
anyone
who
wanted
to
attend
a
city
school
system
to
attend
it.
the
district
court
expressed
doubt
about
the
validity
of
that.
we
said
very
well
and
if
there
is
any
question
about
it,
if
that
shows
any
casting
of
doubt
upon
our
good
faith,
we
freely
and
willingly
give
it
up,
and
we
have.
i
think
that
we
have
to
view
this
case
conceptually
by
going
back
to
the
basics.
what
constitutional
right
has
been
violated?
now,
no
constitutional
right
admittedly
was
violated
at
the
time
the
town
of
emporia
became
a
city
in
1967.
and
so,
if
a
right
has
been
violated,
it
had
to
be
violated
as
a
result
of
having
a
separate
school
system
flowing
from
the
city
status.
and
you
look
at
the
school
system
and
you
see
that
there
is
a
completely
and
wholly
unitary
system
in
the
city
of
emporia.
you
look
if
you
will
at
the
county
school
system
and
you
see
a
complete
and
wholly
unitary
school
system
in
the
county.nothing
artificial
in
either
case,
nothing
forced,
nothing
temporarily
expedient
in
order
to
obtain
some
particular
boundaries.
but
the
natural
consequences
of
non-state
action
result
in
two
separate
school
units,
each
having
within
it
a
unitary
system,
each
with
no
predominance
of
one
race
over
the
other,
but
each
representing
the
community
which
it
intended
to
serve.
now,
if
--
if
there
is
a
constitutional
right
involved,
it
must
be
a
constitutional
right
to
a
specified
ratio
because
we're
not
damaging
any
other
right.
that
must
be
a
right
to
a
specified
ratio
in
some
geographic
area.
we
submit
that
swann
didn't
say
that,
green
didn't
say
that,
and
spencer
against
kugler
decided
by
this
court
in
january
did
not
say
that.
where
there
is
no
showing
of
state
action
which
produced
a
ratio
pattern
in
a
community
and
certainly
inside
of
south
virginia
based
no
racial
pattern.
there
is
a
--
it
is
a
completely
intermixed
community.
no
one
in
emporia
lives
over
three
blocks
from
someone
of
a
different
race.he
just
--
it's
just
that
way.
so,
not
only
is
no
state
action
creating
a
racial
pattern,
it
doesn't
exist
just
as
in
kugler.
just
as
in
kugler,
the
boundary
lines
of
the
city
of
emporia
were
not
drawn
in
an
attempt
to
gerrymander
in
or
out
anyone.
and
when
i
mentioned
that,
i'm
reminded
of
the
fact
that
enclosing
counsel
for
the
plaintiffs
mentioned
something
about
75%
of
the
children
being
included
out.
25%
of
his
plans
are
included
in
a
substantially
better
system
which
is
the
uncontradicted
evidence
in
this
case.
and
certainly,
they
are
entitled
to
rights
where
a
unitary
school
system
can
bring
about
a
better
school
system,
then
it
ought
to
be
implemented
too
often.
i
feel
assure
you
have
the
arguments
before
you
that
the
unitary
school
system
is
going
to
bring
about
a
poorer
school
system.
this
is
just
an
opposite
of
that
argument
and
it
is
a
sincere
argument.
and
it
is
an
argument
which
is
not
contradicted
in
the
evidence.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
evidence
is
conclusive
to
the
effect
found
by
the
district
court.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
--
the
record
which
we
have
presented
to
you
is
abundantly
clear
that
the
problem
of
having
a
separate
--
the
desire
to
have
a
separate
school
system
for
the
city
of
emporia
just
as
every
other
city
in
--
in
virginia
has,
has
been
one
of
the
long
standing.
the
dissatisfaction
with
the
arrangement
that
we've
had
with
the
county
is
one
that
is
ingrained.
the
ameliorative
influence
that
you
have
suggested
of
having
representation
on
the
board
proportionate
would
not
cure
the
problems
that
existed
--
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
yes
--
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
it
--
it
was
offered
--
we
offered
to
do
it,
if
your
honor
please,
because
--
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
well,
we
first
say
it's
been
withdrawn.
but
second,
we'd
say
we've
got
something
better.
we've
got
our
--
we've
got
what
we
think
is
--
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
the
experience
that
we've
had
with
the
county
has
changed
our
mind
and
the
case
of
green,
the
(inaudible)
has
changed
our
minds.
i
say
that
without
blanching
at
it
at
all
because
a
county
could
operate
a
reasonably
good
school
system
under
the
circumstances
that
existed
prior
to
green.
they
had
no
will
to
implement
green.
they
had
no
desire
to
implement
green
and
this
is
what
the
evidence
shows.
i'm
not
stating
my
view,
the
evidence
shows
that,
apathy
with
respect
to
green.
the
evidence
shows
that
they,
post-green,
didn't
increase
their
budget
even
and
have
to
take
care
of
inflation.
and
yet,
the
needs
that
arise,
post-green,
a
far
and
greater
than
the
pre-green
leaves.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
insofar
as
race
is
concerned?
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
there
are
four
people
on
this
county
--
county
school
board,
three
of
them
are
white
and
one
of
them
is
black.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
population
of
the
county
is
above
9000.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
roughly,
50:50.
i
think
that
i'm
correct
in
saying
it's
four.
any
--
any
event,
it's
the
four
or
five
and
one
of
them
was
black.
i
think
it's
four.
if
there
is
anything
in
the
decision
of
swann
with
respect
to
the
problem
of
flexibility,
that
problem
being
met
by
flexibility
that
the
school
boards
have
plenary
power
provided,
there
is
no
invidious
discrimination.
then,
this
is
a
case
to
imply
--
to
apply
the
language
of
swann.
this
is
a
case
where
a
city
has
undertaken
its
obligation
under
brown
and
has
asked
and
fought
for
the
right
through
the
courts
to
provide
a
realistic
unitary
school
system
to
--
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
if
it
is
a
factor
in
this
case,
it's
a
most
muted
one.
we
have
an
area
that
is
already
a
municipality
--
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
they
didn't
make
any
observation
on
that
that
i
can
recall.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
nor
did
the
district
court.
there
was
discussion
of
the
fact
that
a
good
school
system
would
help
make
a
viable
growing
community
which
would
include
growth,
white
and
black.
but,
so
far
as
i
can
recall,
neither
the
district
court
nor
the
court
of
appeals
addressed
itself
to
white
flight
and
insofar
as
i
can
recall,
neither
did
our
evidence.
however,
i
think
it's
obvious
that
the
better
the
school
system,
the
more
people
will
stay
in
it,
white
and
black.
mr.
d.
dortch
warriner
we
have
managed
to
keep
them
out
of
our
county
and
city
up
to
now.
i
hope
we
can
always
do
that.
thank
you,
your
honor.
