justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
--
i
take
it
that
under
virginia
law,
a
school
district
like
the
emporia
became
--
could
contract
with
the
adjoining
county
without
joining
with
it
in
a
joint
school
board,
could
contract
for
educational
services
to
city
children.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
--
so
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
so,
you
make
emporia
since
1965
and
then
acting
in
conflict
with
that
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.constitute
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
is
that
--
that
contract
has
been
the
subject
for
litigation
in
the
virginia
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there's
no
decision?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
be
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
decision
of
the
lower
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
was
there
--
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
any
allegations
in
this
case
or
any
findings
by
the
district
court
that
the
decision
to
become
a
city
had
anything
to
do
with
the
school
to
join?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
virginia
law,
if
a
city
in
the
surrounding
county
had
this
joint
arrangement,
this
joint
school
board
as
the
law
permits,
how
does
the
city
under
the
law
then
paid
for
its
education?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
don't
become
subject
to
a
county
taxation?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
under
--
justice
byron
r.
white
under
the
law
--
the
representation
that
the
city
would
have
to
have
on
the
board
as
it
specified?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
what
kind
of
a
ruling
had
voting
control
of
the
joint
board?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
county
give
a
reason
for
rejecting
the
proposal?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
anyway,
it's
not
in
the
record.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
district
court
purport
to
make
--
issue
any
opinion
on
the
legality
of
the
contract
arrangements?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
district
court's
order,
what
is
the
arrangement
between
a
city
and
county?
were
they
specified?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
how
about
the
money?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
plan
has
been
in
operation
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
a
county
that
appropriating
funds
to
implement
the
plan?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
county?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
for
transportation?
listed
in
the
district
court
quite
involve
some
bussing,
did
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
and
readily,
city
councils
have
minutes
that
they
were
careful,
a
county
wouldn't
seriously
implement
the
plan.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
are?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
is
a
part
of
the
district
court's
plan,
the
court
had
--
had
ordered,
i'm
not
suggesting
it
had
the
power
to
or
not
suggesting
it
didn't
but
suppose
it
had
ordered
that
the
county
make
available
to
the
city
a
proportionate
share
based
on
students,
a
proportionate
share
or
representation
on
the
county
school
board,
and
that
the
money
that
the
city
was
going
to
contribute,
let's
assume
was
passed
in
terms
of
anybody's
judgment,
would
you
still
be
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
may
not
have
cured
it
but
you
offered
to
do
it
once.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wanted
to
do
it
once
that
was
rejected?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
--
why
wouldn't
of
that
argument?
what
was
--
what
if
the
--
if
the
county
had
come
back
and
limited
and
the
district
court
proceeded
and
said,
“now,
we
accept
your
offer.”
why
wouldn't
you
have
accepted
it
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
was
--
has
changed
your
mind?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
composition
of
the
county
school
board?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
number
and
race.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what's
the
population
of
the
county?
justice
byron
r.
white
divided
between
blacks
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
say
that
the
--
do
you
say
then
that
the
desire
to
maintain
a
racial
balance
in
the
school
acceptable
to
the
white
population
is
not
a
factor
in
this
case
as
in
--
as
it
is
said
to
be
in
the
scotland
neck?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
say
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
about
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
agree
that
--
that
neither
the
district
court
nor
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
race
was
a
factor
in
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
court
of
appeals
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
court
of
appeals
said
the
record
does
not
intend
for
--
emporia
chose
to
become
a
city
in
order
to
prevent
or
diminish
integration.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
was
--
is
the
decision
to
become
a
city.
the
real
question
is,
what
(voice

--
justice
byron

white
you
don't
say
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
langford,
the
chairman
of
the
school
board
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
testified
that
part
of
the
--
part
of
the
desire
was
to
have
a
quality
school
system
that
would
hold
the
--
hold
the
residents

the
white

in
the
public

rather
