arguments
next

against
the

mr.

you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
tucker,
are
you
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
not
clear
whether
you're
now
taking
issue
with
the
allocation
of
students
entirely
within
emporia
or
whether
you're
talking
about
the
indict
on
the
whole
school
district
as
it
were
or
was
before
emporia
was
carved
out?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
but
i
--
i
--
your
--
your
last
remarks
that
in
the
figures
you
were
giving.
that
is,
do
you
challenge
the
end
result
within
emporia
as
an
improper
allocation
just
as
to
emporia
laying
aside
the
impact
on
the
district
or
county
as
a
whole?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
you
suggesting
a
reverse
flight
that
is
a
county
flight
into
the
city
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
of
white
pupils.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
want
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
forgive
me
again
so
i
have
it
clear
in
my
mind
what
is
the
composition
of
the
emporia
schools?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
within
emporia,
what
is
the
breakdown?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
the
--
at
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
at
the
present
and
what
--
what
was
before
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
what
are
those
figures
at
present
in
emporia
--
within
the
city
of
emporia?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what's
the
figure
again?
700?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
we'll
continue
there
after
lunch,
mr.
tucker.
mr.
tucker,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
warriner.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say
it
automatically
became
a
school
district,
could
the
--
had
any
option
about
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
did
the
district
court
plan
going
to
effect?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you've
said
“was
to.”
did
it
or
did
it
not
go
into
effect?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
well,
that
--
that's
why
your
phrase
“was
to
go
into
effect”
mislead
me
for
a
moment.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
--
it
went
into
effect
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
stay
the
order?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
you
said
that
if
the
school
board,
the
emporia
city
plan
had
gone
into
effect,
it
would've
been
55:45?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
what
is
in
fact
now
--
let
me
get
that
difference
clearly
in
mind?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
because
of
the
going
outside
the
city
into
the
county?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
warriner.
mr.
tucker.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
tucker,
let
ask
you
one
question.
suppose
in
1965,
was
that
when
this
litigation
of
your
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
case
started?
suppose
in
1965,
emporia
had
reached
this
5000
population
point.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
it
had
the
other
--
well,
it
makes
it
easier.
and
emporia
said,
“we're
tired
of
waiting
for
these
people
out
in
the
county
to
catch
up
with
what
the
court
so
required
in
compliance
with
the
constitution
and
we
want
to
run
a
purely
unitary
system
and
they
withdrew,
and
they'd
run
a
unitary
system
with
percentages
which
now
prevailed,
what
have
just
been
described
to
us,
and
they'd
been
doing
it
ever
since.
this
--
i
think
the
district
court
will
have
the
power
to
say,
“yes,
that's
fine.
that
you
were
ahead
of
these
people
all
these
time
but
now
you've
got
to
be
put
into
the
whole
--
the
county
system.”
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
suppose
they
had
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
hypothetical
question,
would
the
district
court
now
have
the
power
to
do
what
it
did?
