mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
was
commenced
on
march
15,
1965
before
the
city
of
emporia
came
into
being.
the
litigation
was
litigation
against
the
county
school
board
of
greensville
county
to
require
desegregation
of
public
schools
which
it
operated
has
a
biracial
school
--
school
system
for
the
entire
county
including
what
then
was
the
town
of
emporia.
at
that
time,
all
of
the
county's
white
children
attended
the
schools
located
in
emporia.
there
were
two
such
schools,
one,
the
emporia
elementary
school,
one,
the
greensville
county
high
school.
both
of
which
located
in
the
town
of
emporia
was
at
that
time,
and
they
were
the
only
schools
which
white
children
in
the
county
attended.
the
--
in
other
words,
children
who
live
in
the
county
cross
the
line
to
attend
--
white
children
who
live
in
the
county
cross
the
line
to
attend
schools
in
the
city.
some
of
the
negro
children,
the
elementary
children
who
live
in
the
city
cross
the
lines
to
attend
schools
at
the
county,
all
of
the
negro
high
school
children
who
live
in
the
city
cross
the
line
to
attend
schools
at
the
county.
that's
one
school
system.
as
far
as
the
school
system
is
concern,
there
were
no
political
lines.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
there
was
one
negro
school
in
the
city
which
had
been
the
old
high
school
or
the
training
school
doubling
this
high
school
and
other
school
and
there--
there's
a
--
as
far
as
the
high
school
is
concerned,
it
was
replaced
by
new
school.
in
1953,
i
believe,
it
was
built
about
a
mile
north
of
the
town.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
greensville
county
is
on
this
north
carolina
line.
it's
just
about
10
to
20
miles
of
--
north
haley
place
county
which
was
just
being
spoken
about.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
it's
quite
close
to
scotland
neck,
yes.
after
four
years
of
litigation,
we
prevailed
upon
the
district
court
to
require
a
plan
that
would
prompt
us
realistically
to
--
to
desegregate
the
schools.
the
essence
of
the
plan
was
one
that
was
proposed
by
the
plaintiffs
and
that
was
to
assign
certain
grades
to
certain
schools
and
assign
children
other
who
lived
in
the
city
or
in
the
county
to
the
grade
served
in
that
particular
school.
specifically
of
interest
here,
all
the
children
in
grades
one,
two
and
three
were
assigned
to
the
emporia
elementary
school
in
emporia,
that
then
the
traditional
white
elementary
school.and
all
the
children
in
grades
10,
11
and
12
were
assigned
to
the
greensville
county
high
school
in
emporia
that
hadn't
been
the
--
the
traditional
white
school.
and
all
of
the
children
in
those
intermediate
grades
were
assigned
to
the
previously
all-black
schools
in
accordance
to
the
grades
that
those
schools
had
served.
now,
immediately
after
the
district
court
gave
approval
to
this
plan,
the
city
of
emporia
decided
it
would
take
over
the
two
traditionally
white
schools
and
operate
them
as
a
separate
school
system.
and
the
court
of
appeals
has
held,
reversing
the
district
court
that
this
should
have
been
permitted.
and
if
--
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
well
--
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
became
a
city
while
this
case
was
pending.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
which
i
don't
--
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
well,
if
they
had
the
(inaudible).
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
but
in
--
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
--
in
the
local
court
to
show
that
reaches
a
population
of
5000.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
it
really
doesn't
make
a
lot
of
difference
because
as
a
town,
they
could've
operated
the
separate
school
system
if
they
had
wanted
to.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
they
could
have.
there
are
towns
of
virginia
that
have
separate
school
systems.
now,
we
say
that
--
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
it's
not
a
--
it's
in
--
politically
independent
of
the
county,
that
is
true.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
it's
not
politically
independent,
that's
correct.
now,
we
think
that
court
of
appeals
reached
its
judgment
through
a
certain
unfortunate
distortions
of
the
evidence.
so,
we
have
held
to
discuss
the
evidence
at
quite
some
length
because
we
wouldn't
like
the
same
thing
to
happen
here.
and
first,
we'll
start
with
sort
of
an
overview
of
the
county
and
the
--
and
the
area.
the
longest
is
a
small
county,
only
312
or
so
square
miles.
along
the
straight
line
distance
were
being
measured
from
east
to
west
or
whether
you
measure
it
from
north
to
south
is
a
--
north
to
south
would
be
about
25
miles.
the
county
average
is
about
12
to
13
miles
in
--
in
that.
this
shaded
area
here
schematically
into
some
of
the
county
is
emporia.
and
the
meherrin
river
puts
the
west-east
across
and
then
right
through
the
middle
of
emporia
and
on
and
over.
so,
in
the
literal
sense,
it
turns
out
that
all
roads
sort
of
lead
to
emporia
and
the
only
bridges
across
that
river
are
at
--
are
at
emporia.
the
bridge
that
the
local
people
used
to
use
is
the
connecting
link
between
north
main
street
and
south
main
street
emporia.
another
significant
fact
is
which
minimizes
this
question
of
transportation
and
so
forth,
every
school
in
the
system
of
the
--
the
high
school
is
built
for
the
negro
high
school
is
located
both
here
at
the
elementary
school,
one
here
over,
one
over
here.
all
of
them
within
a
--
a
radius
of
two
and
a
half
miles
from
--
from
some
point
in
emporia.
no
school
is
more
than
two
or
three
miles
over
town.
so,
the
distance
travelled
or
the
difference
in
distances
and
this
problem
are
minimal.
and
between
1965
when
this
litigation
was
commenced,
in
1969
when
complete
desegregation
was
ordered,
the
black
majority
of
pupils
had
decreased
by
223,
from
2700
to
2477.
and
white
minority
had
decreased
by
518,
from
1800
to
1282.
this
is
the
talk
about
the
school
system
about
3750
pupils
roughly.
as
to
that
effortless
litigation
had
been
two
years
and
going,
july
1,
1967,
emporia
obtained
its
conversion
to
a
second
class
of
status.
and
we
don't
make
a
big
point
about
the
testimony
that
their
purpose
was
to
get
a
big
--
better
break
of
the
sales
tax
proceeds.
but
we
do
submit
that
whatever
the
underlying
motivation
for
the
transition,
the
transition
was
made
subject
to
the
right,
the
power
and
the
duty
of
district
court
to
dispose
of
this
case.
and
to
accomplish
the
desegregation
of
the
schools
in
the
county
including
those
that
were
situated
in
emporia.
now,
as
the
law
required,
the
--
the
emporia
city
council
appointed
members
to
a
newly
formed
emporia
school
board.
and
that
school
board
function
only
in
two
respects.
it
joined
in
signing
the
april
10,
1968
contract
between
emporia
and
greensville
county
of
which
the
county
was
going
to
continue
to
provide
certain
essential
services
brought
out
this
year
in
courthouse
and
even
--
and
specifically
the
public
schools
and
the
city
agreed
that
they
would
pay
a
share
calculated
on
a
percentage
basis
for
those
services.
on
the
--
on
the
other
function
performed
by
the
school
board
until
desegregation
was
ordered,
was
that
the
school
board
met
--
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
if
it
was
annually
or
--
or
once
a
year,
joined
with
the
county
school
board
so
that
they
could
legally
hire
a
superintendant
of
the
schools.
otherwise,
the
schools
went
on,
the
county
school
board
ran
the
schools'
business
as
usual.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
was
no
complaint,
no
question
at
all
on
the
part
of
the
city
school
officials
of
the
city
council
numbers
as
to
the
resistance
that
the
county
school
was
putting
up
to
this
lawsuit
to
desegregate
the
schools.
and,
even
after
the
new
kent
case,
they
now
properly
filed
motion
for
relief
in
light
of
the
new
kent,
the
county
school
board
was
successful
by
one
way
or
another
by
proposing
plans
that
obviously
would
not
work
a
series
or
everything
that
they
successfully
held
of
inevitable
for
a
full
year.
until
the
district
court
considering
that
the
county
board
had
repeatedly
failed
and
virtually
refused
to
propose
an
adequate
desegregation
plan
as
to
the
plaintiffs
would
prepare
a
plan
which
we
did
in
the
sense
that
that's
a
plan
that's
in
operation
in
--
in
the
schools
right
now.
and
when
the
court
announced
that
it
would
adopt
that
plan
and
that
also
being
made
in
june
of
1969.
but
the
taste
of
a
hard-worked
victory
didn't
last
very
long
because
suddenly,
final
result
hadn't
been
another
ball
game.
on
july
23rd,
when
the
county
school
board
sought
to
have
the
court
make
amendments
to
the
plan
that
the
plaintiffs
had
offered,
they
would
desire
--
considered
administratively
desirable
and
they
were
not
objected
to
by
the
plaintiffs.and
the
court
taking
that
matter
on
advisement
was
advised
that
the
--
by
the
county
school
board
that
they
may
have
to
come
back
to
submit
another
plan
if
the
city
children
withdrew
from
the
school
system.
and
that
remark
the
literate
plaintiff's
counsel
to
their
counter
attack
that
was
then
being
developed
by
the
city
of
emporia.
we
found
that
on
july
7,
the
count
--
city
council
had
sent
a
letter
to
the
county
board
of
supervisors
and
the
county
school
board
and
their
legal
adviser
which
the
letter
is
printed
in
the
appendix
at
page
56.
the
letter
takes
note
of
the
federal
court's
decision,
desegregate.
and
the
second
paragraph
of
the
complaint
and
we'll
quote,
“the
directive
plan
becomes
even
more
unpalatable
when
the
school
records
reflects
those
students
of
a
city
who
attend
to
combine
school
system
are
not
contributing
to
the
imbalance
which
apparently
led
the
court
to
order
school
class
relocations,
bussing,
et
cetera.”
the
county
was
by
then
better
requested
to
transfer
to
the
city
the
title
to
all
school
property
sighted
within
the
city.
and
in
return,
the
county
was
promised
that
upon
payment
of
tuition,
the
county
students
might
attend
the
city
schools
on
a
first
come,
first
serve
basis.
and
we
think
it
obvious
that
they
were
referring
to
the
white
students
of
the
county.
as
if
the
--
if
they
had
been
anticipating
the
black
students
of
the
county
also
attending
the
schools
had
been
no
real
purpose
for
their
separating
the
schools.
this
is
just
one
of
the
many
evidences
in
this
record
justifying
the
district
court's
finding
that
emporia's
decision
to
secede
from
the
county
was
racially
motivated.
from
the
beginning,
the
city's
concern
was
with
the
1880
black
county
children,
two-third
--
three-fourths
i
believe,
were
the
plaintiff
class
who
as
the
city
officials
sought,
calls
a
racial
imbalance
which
had
required
the
desegregation
order.
on
july
14,
1969,
the
minutes
of
that
time
the
appendix
at
page
62
and
we
think
that
they
are
the
essence
of
the
plaintiff's
case
here.
on
july
14th,
the
city
council
admit
publicly
on
a
special
session.
they
leave
--
those
minutes
leave
no
doubt
as
to
the
purpose
of
the
assembly
was
to
the
motivation
as
though
--
of
those
who
addressed
the
assembly
including
the
council
meetings
--
the
council
members.
merely
announced
and
we
quote,
“the
purpose
of
the
meeting
is
to
take
action
on
the
establishment
of
a
city
school
system
to
try
and
save
a
school
system
for
the
city
of
emporia
and
greensville
county.”
he
further
--
later
said
that
the
city
of
emporia
and
greensville
county
are
as
one.
we
could
work
together
to
save
our
school
system.
and
cases
came
on
to
trial,
the
things
that
--
well,
we
had
to
say
about
the
officials
of
greensville
county
were
--
were
less
complimentary
and
we
get
the
idea
that
greensville
county
and
emporia
had
been
waging
along
--
long
drawn
out
war.
by
the
time
they're
making
this
decision
that
at
the
time
that
they're
under
--
really
under
the
impact
of
the
federal
court
order,
the
city
and
the
county
wanted
--
we
can
cooperate
and
still
see
if
our
school
system
and
carry
on
business
as
we
always
have.
mr.
langford
to
show
the
racial
interest
in
--
in
their
decision
of
the
racial
effect
in
that
decision,
chairman
of
the
city
school
board
gave
a
plan
based
on
judge
merritt's
ruling
and
percentages
of
negroes
at
each
school
for
the
first
seven
grades
if
judge
merritt's
order
would
--
would
be
allowed
to
go
into
effect.
you
cannot
read
the
minutes
of
the
meeting
without
seeing
that
the
thing
about
which
the
city
was
unhappy
was
the
fact
that
the
district
court
order
was
going
to
require
actual
desegregation
of
the
public
schools
of
greensville
county.
at
the
foot
of
page
65
and
--
for
me
to
say
minutes,
you'll
see
that
mr.
langford,
chairman
of
the
school
board,
told
the
council
that
approximately
500
county
children
could
attend
city
schools
if
the
city
obtained
the
buildings
it
wanted.
they
have
only
728
white
children
--
white
county
children
in
the
system.
now,
a
separate
system
offered
the
only
way
to
continue
to
insulate
these
children
from
that
mass
--
of
what
we
consider
mass
of
1888
black
children
who
lived
in
the
county.
and
that
was
what
was
to
be
accomplished
at
all
cost
even,
and
we
get
for
the
minutes,
even
if
it
required
moving
into
temporary
buildings
and
using
makeshift
equipment
as
amount
of
the
separation.
now,
at
the
interlocutory
hearing,
hearing
on
interlocutory
injunction
some
three
weeks
later,
the
man
responses
and
city
attorney's
leading
question
testified
that
the
primary
motive,
and
seeking
to
separate
was
to
provide
a
substantially
superior
education.
and
once
relate
that
the
december
plenary
hearing,
the
city
school
board
exhibited
an
elaborately
expensive
budget
which
the
school
board
saw
for
the
first
time
and
adopted
at
a
meeting
held
15
days
prior
to
the
trial
in
which
the
city
council
saw
for
the
first
time
and
adopted
the
meaning
two
--
two
nights
later.
but
in
july,
the
decision
to
secede
was
made,
the
whole
mark
quality
was
a
more
palatable
percentage
of
black
children.
and
the
physical
thinking
reflected
in
the
july
meeting
was
the
expression
of
the
mayor
that
city
system
wouldn't
cost
anymore
than
they
were
paying
being
with
the
county.
and
that
they
could
take
county
students
in
on
a
tuition
basis.
nothing
else
in
that
meeting,
only
questions
of
adolescence
sense
was
expressed.
that
was
i
think
in
--
in
july
when
the
city
school
board
was
instructed
to
take
immediate
steps
to
establish
a
school
division
from
the
city
of
emporia,
and
the
city
attorney
was
instructed
to
take
immediate
steps
to
effect
the
legal
separation
in
terms
of
the
equity
of
--
of
the
--
which
the
city
and
county
had
in
the
jointly
owned
--
in
the
jointly
owned
property.
july
31st,
the
city
school
board
published
a
notice
to
parents
that
they
should
--
city
parents
that
they
should
register
in
the
city
schools
and
in
--
but
that
notice
invited
the
county
parents
to
register
their
children
on
the
first
come
--
no
transportation
tuition
basis.
the
city
attorney
wasn't
quite
so
prompt
in
executing
his
direct
there
because
it
went
until
october
of
1969
that
he
filed
a
suit
to
have
the
state
court
invalidate
the
contract
if
the
contract
was
indeed
invalid.
and
for
some
reason,
the
court
of
appeals
was
in
the
impression
that
the
sequence
of
events
happened
at
first
in
june
of
1969,
the
city
attorney
advised
the
council
that
the
contract
was
void.
and
the
city
then
filed
action
in
the
state
courts
to
have
the
contract
invalidated.
and
then
the
parents
were
then
notified
that
the
city
children
would
attend
city
schools
has
been
--
the
plaintiffs
followed
the
supplemental
complaint
seeking
an
injunction,
but
things
didn't
happen
in
that
sequence.
the
notification
to
the
parents
was
dated
july
31st.
the
supplemental
complaint
was
filed
august
1st.
the
hearing
on
the
motion
for
the
interlocutory
injunction
was
august
8th
and
sometime
after
that
hearing,
the
council
doubt
this
was
advised
that
the
contract
might
be
successfully
attacked.
in
the
court
now
on
october
1st,
the
--
a
suit
for
--
for
that
purpose
was
filed
in
the
state
court.
now,
there
are
erroneous
empiric
questions
the
court
of
appeals
seems
to
have
stemmed
with
the
testimony
of
mr.
langford,
chairman
of
the
city
school
board
who
was
asked
by
the
city
attorney,
“when
did
you
obtain
a
lawyer
who
advised
you
that
the
contract
was
illegal
and
violative
of
the
constitution?”
and
his
answer
was
in
june.
but
on
cross
examination,
we
devote
that
the
advice
was
a
matter
--
something
to
him
as
an
individual,
he
was
not
a
member
of
the
council.
the
chairman
of
the
school
board
was
not
giving
at
a
meeting
of
the
school
board
of
the
city
council
or
any
other
group.
and
when
we
read
--
read
the
testimony
that
was
being
heard
at
the
august
interlocutory
hearing,
we
find
that
the
--
that
the
school
board
people
and
the
city
council
people
looked
upon
this
contract
as
a
formidable
obstacle.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
went
back
to
the
minutes
of
that
july
meeting
in
which
the
city
attorney
was
present.
this
followed
the
contract
as
being
something
that
might
be
of
a
void
by
mutual
consent
or
by
annexation
that
makes
you
a
territory
from
the
county.
the
contract
had
a
provision
had
a
provision
that
it
would
be
terminated
if
the
city
did
take
an
annexation.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
yes,
sir?
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
district
court's
findings
support
of
the
position.
it
gave
the
date
on
which
the
--
the
city
filed
its
lawsuit
this
october.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
the
district
court
found
that
the
--
he
found
the
order
is
mixed.
he
says
that
the
--
that
the
--
raised
and
motivated,
he
gave
them
credit
for
their
protestations
that
they
wanted
to
develop
a
better
school
system
but
he
could
not
close
his
eyes
to
the
fact
that
the
thing
that
--
that
triggered
the
entire
thing
was
his
order.
i
think
that's
a
fair
statement
of
it,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
but,
in
another
and
perhaps
more
important
aspect,
the
fourth
circuit
majority
misstated
the
facts
of
the
case.
the
circuit
court
sought
to
ascertain
the
primary
purpose
of
the
city
by
looking
to
the
projections
of
the
numbers
and
percentages
of
the
black
and
white
students
will
be
attending
the
two
systems.
the
city's
witness
had
predicted
a
48%
black
and
a
52%
white
ratio
in
the
city-operated
high
school,
in
a
similar
but
in
greater
ratio
in
the
city-operated
elementary
schools.
but
these
predictions
link
the
facts.
the
anticipated
return
of
10%
of
the
school
population
from
the
private
school
would
increase
the
white
percentage
of
the
high
school
to
56%.
this
--
there
is
some
talk
in
the
testimony
about
annexation
and
they
could
annex
outline
areas
of
the
county
and
--
and
increase
the
white
population
of
the
county
immeasurably.
well,
how
--
the
figure
isn't
given
and
this
is
the
part
that's
not
accurate
work.
and
then
as
--
face
the
reality
of
why
he's,
they
didn't
take
in
account
that
the
children
who
lived
in
the
county
wouldn't
manage
to
live
with
relatives
in
the
--
in
the
city
or
with
friends
or
people
who
had
moved
out
--
who
could
afford
to
move
from
the
county
into
the
city
or
into
the
newly
--
the
part
of
the
city
to
be
annexed
in
order
to
--
that
their
children
could
attend
the
public
schools.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
well,
i
think
there's
a
little
difficulty
to
keep
the
two
separate
because
one
--
one
bears
on
the
other
anyhow.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
i
might
--
i
--
i
find
it
difficult
to
really
think
that
the
figures
and
vicinities
make
no
difference
but,
when
i
look
at
the
entire
picture
of
whatever
happens
in
emporia
to
increase
the
white
majority
is
--
wanted
to
increase
the
black
majority
in
the
counties.
and
it
doesn't
take
a
lot
of
imagination
that
--
to
see
that
the
county
schools
would
become
for
all
intensive
purposes
or
remain
for
the
intensive
purposes
of
the
black
schools.
well,
if
they
--
few
shifts,
annexation
or
adjustments
or
tuition
basis
or
a
county
children
attend
the
city
schools
on
tuition
basis
that
the
white
children
would
remain
out
of
the
school
sighted
in
the
county
just
as
they
have
remained
of
those
schools
during
the
freedom
of
choice
and
during
(inaudible).
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
i
am
suggesting
that.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
that
--
that's
what
would
--
would
happen
and
i
think
the
--
i
think
that's
fairly
what
the
--
what
the
council
meant
when
it
was
trying
to
negotiate
with
the
city,
whit
--
with
this
county.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
but
to
get
the
buildings
and
promising
the
county
children
they
come
in
on
a
tuition
basis
and
so
forth.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
i
--
i
--
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
at
present
of
what
the
--
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
--
of
what
the
emporia
proposed.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
at
the
present,
the
--
the
plan
that
the
plaintiffs
proposed
and
the
--
and
the
district
court
approved
is
in
operation
and
it
has
been
in
operation
for
two
and
a
half
years.
so
that
the
grades
one,
two
and
three
of
children
from
all
over
the
area
attended
the
emporia
elementary
school
and
grades
10,
11
and
12
from
children
all
over
the
area,
both
county
and
city
had
presently
attend
the
high
school
and
had
been
doing
so
for
two
and
half
years.
it
happens
that
we
got
the
injunction
entirely
and
the
district
court
gave
the
injunction
to
protect
this
order
and
the
order
went
into
effect
and
--
and
--
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
i
--
as
i
said
that
--
that
these
at
the
present,
the
best
figures
that
we
have
is
that
the
city
had
543
white
children
and
580
negro
children.
the
county
had
728
white
children
and
1888
negro
children.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
728
white,
1888
black.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
that's
correct.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
as
the
record
--
though
our
--
our
updated
figures
which
is
--
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
but
the
record
will
show
--
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
the
record
would
show
on
page
28,
297
of
the
appendix.
in
the
emporia
elementary
school,
that's
30.1%
white
and
69.9%
negro.
and
the
senior
high
school,
that's
in
the
city
--
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
44.9%
white
and
55.1%
negro.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
that
--
that's
quite
a
bit
of
--
we'd
like
to
suggest
that
the
method
that
the
circuit
used
to
--
divine
purpose
from
projection
was
--
was
not
a
valid
method
that
the
only
--
the
best
way
we
know
what
people's
purpose
are
--
as
what
they
say
the
--
the
purpose
is
at
the
time
they're
making
the
decision.
and
the
time
that
they're
making
decision
was
when
we
--
when
we
read
this
--
read
the
minutes.
at
that
time,
i'll
read
what
they
were
doing
and
saying
at
that
time,
the
purpose
is
all
too
clear
and
that
was
to
get
from
out,
from
under
the
district
court's
order.
we
also
would
like
to
suggest
that
the
circuit
formed
a
rule
of
--
ascertain
the
dominant
purpose.
but
we
think
it
here,
did
not
--
it
applied
that
rule
rather
than
remand
to
the
district
court
for
him
to
have,
made
the
assessment
in
the
light
of
that
rule.
we
think
that
in
any
aspect
of
this
case,
the
--
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed
by
any
one
of
six
reasons.
one,
any
validity
could
possibly
attach
to
the
fourth
circuit's
requirement
of
a
balancing
of
benign
purpose
against
the
constitutional
imperative.
then,
this
--
we're
going
to
read
new
rule
as
we
said,
the
case
should
have
been
remanded
to
the
district
court
who
made
the
initial
judgment
and
the
balancing.
we
suggest
that
the
proposed
balancing
test
is
invalid.
that
the
constitution
commands
that
the
school
systems
be
desegregated
and
it
makes
no
exception
to
permit
that
command
to
be
subordinated
to
notions
of
quality,
education,
anything
else
also
benign.
and
what
we
have
here
was
a
system
they
could
point
to
the
beautiful
school
system
they
have
for
emporia.
they
omit
the
fact
that
the
three
force
of
the
plaintiff
class
is
going
to
be
automatically
cut
other
than
beautiful
system.
and
i
don't
think
that
the
constitution
allows
us
to
balance
the
rights
of
those
children
against
the
proposed
benign
purposes.
we
think
that
--
as
was
said,
that
we
think
the
fourth
circuit
here,
in
--
in
trying
ascertain
or
ignoring
the
motivations
and
purposes
as
expressed
with
as
the
fact
was
going
on
rather
than
try
to
ascertain
them
from
some
projections.
we
think
that
the
district
court
--
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
--
was
correct
--
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
we
would
to
submit
--
i'll
save
the
rest
of
our
counter
rebuttal.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
thank
you
--
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
that's
right.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
i
think
it
had.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i
live
there.
and
if
emporia
had
1965
decided,
and
made
in
a
such
decision,
you
could've
knocked
me
over
with
a
feather.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
but
suppose
they
had
--
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
i
think
it
probably
would
have
had
the
power.
if
anything
like
i
believe
is
--
would
happen
in
emporia
that
--
had
emporia
--
or
had
emporia,
you're
saying,
created
a
unitary,
nonracial
school
system
as
early
as
1965,
would
the
district
court
have
had
power
to
eliminate
the
lines
and
expand
the
school
system
to
--
to
--
i
think
it
could
have
if
the
necessities
would've
required
it.
if,
as
a
result
of
that
or
even
without
result,
if
it
had
meant
that
the
children
in
the
county
were
attending
what
in
effect
were
racially
segregated
schools
because
that
--
if
it
--
if
it
meant
that
the
children
of
the
county
were
attending
racial
identifiable
schools
were
being
denied
equal
protection
of
laws,
i
think
the
district
court
could
take
--
could
use
the
command
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
state,
not
to
a
city,
not
to
a
county,
to
provide
equal
education
opportunities
for
all
the
children
in
the
state
where
as
far
as
that
is
practical.
so,
i
--
i
wouldn't
have
in
a
whole
lot
of
problem
if
--
if
the
evidence
demonstrated
the
necessity
for
that
--
for
the
district
court
to
have
erased
the
lines
and
--
and
required
one
school
system.
because
after
all,
the
--
that
doctrine
of
federalism
does
not
recognize
the
state's
(inaudible)
to
base
the
command
to
the
state,
not
to
denying
the
first
within
its
jurisdiction
of
the
state
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
and
that
is
the
basis
for
this
entire
line
of
litigation
now.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
the
district
court
found
that
the
--
that
the
emporia's
plan
of
proposal
was
racially
motivated.
he
says
on
page
--
well,
now,
he
--
he
said
that
the
--
the
motives
were
mixed
and
he
does
not
discount
the
racial
motivation.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
on
page
307
--
307
of
the
appendix,
right
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
“the
court
finds
that
in
a
sense,
race
was
a
factor
into
this
city's
decision
to
secede.”
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
the
court
of
appeals
furnished
the
board
and
the
district
court's
finding
that
race
was
a
factor.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
or
the
decision,
this
is
to
become
a
city,
i
--
i
think
it's
immaterial
to
our
consideration
here.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
in
our
decision
to
secede
from
the
school
system
--
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
--
is
the
thing
that
the
district
court
was
addressing
--
which
found
race
as
been
a
motivating
factor.
and
i
don't
think
it's
a
--
i
don't
think
that
conclusion
is
unavoidable.
we
just
look
at
the
minutes
of
july
14,
1969
when
they
made
the
decision
and
look
at
the
effort
and
look
at
the
things
that
they
did,
even
the
resolution
of
the
city
school
board
asking
the
state
board
to
create
them
a
separate
school
division
points
to,
every
plea
of
it
points
to
the
district
court
orders
the
things
which
they
were
unhappy.
the
--
the
being
unhappy
about
the
poverty
of
the
school
system
came
as
a
matter
--
after
the
application
for
an
injunction
as
a
matter
of
preparation
for
trial.
the
question
was
asked
whether
we
have
a
private
school
but
mr.
warriner
correctly
added
an
--
answered
that
we
don't
have
private
schools
in
the
county
of
greensville.
but
in
the
neighboring
county
of
brunswick,
there
is
a
private
school
wherein
a
considerable
number
of
white
children
do
attend
the
private
school
there.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that's
--
i
think
that's
in
the
record,
the
testimony
of
the
mayor
some
--
somewhere
later
first
to
the
--
people
who
had
--
who
had
gone
to
the
private
school
in
the
neighboring
county
of
brunswick.
you
get
only
across,
out
of
which
would
be
about
20
miles
away
from
emporia.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
well,
my
--
well,
it's
difficult
for
me
to
say
what
judge
meritt
meant.
i
can
say
the
evidence
he's
looking
at
and
i
think
the
evidence
he
is
looking
at
was
the
fact
that
the
people
took
into
consideration
when
they
made
the
decision
to
secede,
they
took
into
consideration
as
--
as
shown
by
their
minutes,
the
percentages
of
blacks
that
will
be
in
the
schools
under
judge
meritt
decision.
the
chairman
of
the
school
board
came
to
the
council
meeting
armed
with
that
information,
the
testimonies
went
by
the
superintendent's
office
to
get
it.
so,
you
could
carry
that
information
to
the
council
--
to
the
council
meeting
at
which
the
formal
decision
to
secede
was
made.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
that's
correct.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
i
recall
that
and
this
is
the
testimony,
sir.
but
again,
i
go
back
to
letter
of
july
14
and
i
find
two
references
to
quality
education
and
i
get
that
the
whole
market
quality
there
was
the
palatable
racial
mix
in
the
schools.
i
mean,
i
--
i
--
that
--
that's
the
impression
i
get
from
reading
the
minutes
of
--
of
july
14
where
they
made
the
decision
as
what
they
were
concerned
about.
they
weren't
concerned
in
spending
money
then
because
their
only
question
of
money
was
the
mayor's
suggestion
that
we
can
operate
city
schools
as
--
as
--
cheaply.
it
was
much
money
as
we're
paying
the
county
and
we
can
take
county
students
in
on
a
tuition
basis.
and
i
can't
omit
the
fact
even
though
now,
the
city
can
protest
that
no
county's
children
will
come
into
--
come
into
the
city.
when
they
decided
to
secede,
their
purpose
was
to
let
children
come
in
on
a
county
basis
and
that
can
not
be
denied.
and
there
was
--
i
have
mentioned
in
my
original
argument
that
the
town
could
have
had
a
separate
school
system
even
when
it
was
a
town.
the
statute
for
that
is
printed
in
the
--
in
our
brief,
i
would
like
to
--
also
to
call
attention
the
--
on
page
--
appendix
4
of
the
petitioner's
brief,
section
2299
which
governs
when
city
contracts
with
--
with
county
to
furnish
facilities.
but
there
is
a
statutory
provision
in
a
--
provided
and
the
city
--
and
the
statute
provides
the
city
representation
on
the
school
board.
and
while
we're
at
that,
i
might
even
point
out
that
the
present
school
board
does
have
one
black
member
who
--
if
my
recollection
is
correct,
have
been
appointed
there
sometime
after
the
court's
decision
to
desegregate
schools,
and
i
point
out
also
that
the
evidence
shows
that
two
of
the
members
of
the
--
of
the
school
board
live
in
the
city
of
emporia.
so,
there
was
that
--
that
sort
of
open
warfare
between
emporia
and
--
and
its
neighbors
in
greensville
county.
there
has
been
a
quite
a
bit
of
cooperation
even
to
the
point
as
we
can
in
--
that
taking
into
position
before
the
district
court
will
in
--
in
our
injunctive
proceedings
to
protect
the
district
court's
order.
yes,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
thank
you.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
was
commenced
on
march
15,
1965
before
the
city
of
emporia
came
into
being.
the
litigation
was
litigation
against
the
county
school
board
of
greensville
county
to
require
desegregation
of
public
schools
which
it
operated
has
a
biracial
school
--
school
system
for
the
entire
county
including
what
then
was
the
town
of
emporia.
at
that
time,
all
of
the
county's
white
children
attended
the
schools
located
in
emporia.
there
were
two
such
schools,
one,
the
emporia
elementary
school,
one,
the
greensville
county
high
school.
both
of
which
located
in
the
town
of
emporia
was
at
that
time,
and
they
were
the
only
schools
which
white
children
in
the
county
attended.
the
--
in
other
words,
children
who
live
in
the
county
cross
the
line
to
attend
--
white
children
who
live
in
the
county
cross
the
line
to
attend
schools
in
the
city.
some
of
the
negro
children,
the
elementary
children
who
live
in
the
city
cross
the
lines
to
attend
schools
at
the
county,
all
of
the
negro
high
school
children
who
live
in
the
city
cross
the
line
to
attend
schools
at
the
county.
that's
one
school
system.
as
far
as
the
school
system
is
concern,
there
were
no
political
lines.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
there
was
one
negro
school
in
the
city
which
had
been
the
old
high
school
or
the
training
school
doubling
this
high
school
and
other
school
and
there--
there's
a
--
as
far
as
the
high
school
is
concerned,
it
was
replaced
by
new
school.
in
1953,
i
believe,
it
was
built
about
a
mile
north
of
the
town.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
greensville
county
is
on
this
north
carolina
line.
it's
just
about
10
to
20
miles
of
--
north
haley
place
county
which
was
just
being
spoken
about.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
it's
quite
close
to
scotland
neck,
yes.
after
four
years
of
litigation,
we
prevailed
upon
the
district
court
to
require
a
plan
that
would
prompt
us
realistically
to
--
to
desegregate
the
schools.
the
essence
of
the
plan
was
one
that
was
proposed
by
the
plaintiffs
and
that
was
to
assign
certain
grades
to
certain
schools
and
assign
children
other
who
lived
in
the
city
or
in
the
county
to
the
grade
served
in
that
particular
school.
specifically
of
interest
here,
all
the
children
in
grades
one,
two
and
three
were
assigned
to
the
emporia
elementary
school
in
emporia,
that
then
the
traditional
white
elementary
school.and
all
the
children
in
grades
10,
11
and
12
were
assigned
to
the
greensville
county
high
school
in
emporia
that
hadn't
been
the
--
the
traditional
white
school.
and
all
of
the
children
in
those
intermediate
grades
were
assigned
to
the
previously
all-black
schools
in
accordance
to
the
grades
that
those
schools
had
served.
now,
immediately
after
the
district
court
gave
approval
to
this
plan,
the
city
of
emporia
decided
it
would
take
over
the
two
traditionally
white
schools
and
operate
them
as
a
separate
school
system.
and
the
court
of
appeals
has
held,
reversing
the
district
court
that
this
should
have
been
permitted.
and
if
--
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
well
--
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
became
a
city
while
this
case
was
pending.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
which
i
don't
--
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
well,
if
they
had
the
(inaudible).
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
but
in
--
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
--
in
the
local
court
to
show
that
reaches
a
population
of
5000.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
it
really
doesn't
make
a
lot
of
difference
because
as
a
town,
they
could've
operated
the
separate
school
system
if
they
had
wanted
to.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
they
could
have.
there
are
towns
of
virginia
that
have
separate
school
systems.
now,
we
say
that
--
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
it's
not
a
--
it's
in
--
politically
independent
of
the
county,
that
is
true.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
it's
not
politically
independent,
that's
correct.
now,
we
think
that
court
of
appeals
reached
its
judgment
through
a
certain
unfortunate
distortions
of
the
evidence.
so,
we
have
held
to
discuss
the
evidence
at
quite
some
length
because
we
wouldn't
like
the
same
thing
to
happen
here.
and
first,
we'll
start
with
sort
of
an
overview
of
the
county
and
the
--
and
the
area.
the
longest
is
a
small
county,
only
312
or
so
square
miles.
along
the
straight
line
distance
were
being
measured
from
east
to
west
or
whether
you
measure
it
from
north
to
south
is
a
--
north
to
south
would
be
about
25
miles.
the
county
average
is
about
12
to
13
miles
in
--
in
that.
this
shaded
area
here
schematically
into
some
of
the
county
is
emporia.
and
the
meherrin
river
puts
the
west-east
across
and
then
right
through
the
middle
of
emporia
and
on
and
over.
so,
in
the
literal
sense,
it
turns
out
that
all
roads
sort
of
lead
to
emporia
and
the
only
bridges
across
that
river
are
at
--
are
at
emporia.
the
bridge
that
the
local
people
used
to
use
is
the
connecting
link
between
north
main
street
and
south
main
street
emporia.
another
significant
fact
is
which
minimizes
this
question
of
transportation
and
so
forth,
every
school
in
the
system
of
the
--
the
high
school
is
built
for
the
negro
high
school
is
located
both
here
at
the
elementary
school,
one
here
over,
one
over
here.
all
of
them
within
a
--
a
radius
of
two
and
a
half
miles
from
--
from
some
point
in
emporia.
no
school
is
more
than
two
or
three
miles
over
town.
so,
the
distance
travelled
or
the
difference
in
distances
and
this
problem
are
minimal.
and
between
1965
when
this
litigation
was
commenced,
in
1969
when
complete
desegregation
was
ordered,
the
black
majority
of
pupils
had
decreased
by
223,
from
2700
to
2477.
and
white
minority
had
decreased
by
518,
from
1800
to
1282.
this
is
the
talk
about
the
school
system
about
3750
pupils
roughly.
as
to
that
effortless
litigation
had
been
two
years
and
going,
july
1,
1967,
emporia
obtained
its
conversion
to
a
second
class
of
status.
and
we
don't
make
a
big
point
about
the
testimony
that
their
purpose
was
to
get
a
big
--
better
break
of
the
sales
tax
proceeds.
but
we
do
submit
that
whatever
the
underlying
motivation
for
the
transition,
the
transition
was
made
subject
to
the
right,
the
power
and
the
duty
of
district
court
to
dispose
of
this
case.
and
to
accomplish
the
desegregation
of
the
schools
in
the
county
including
those
that
were
situated
in
emporia.
now,
as
the
law
required,
the
--
the
emporia
city
council
appointed
members
to
a
newly
formed
emporia
school
board.
and
that
school
board
function
only
in
two
respects.
it
joined
in
signing
the
april
10,
1968
contract
between
emporia
and
greensville
county
of
which
the
county
was
going
to
continue
to
provide
certain
essential
services
brought
out
this
year
in
courthouse
and
even
--
and
specifically
the
public
schools
and
the
city
agreed
that
they
would
pay
a
share
calculated
on
a
percentage
basis
for
those
services.
on
the
--
on
the
other
function
performed
by
the
school
board
until
desegregation
was
ordered,
was
that
the
school
board
met
--
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
if
it
was
annually
or
--
or
once
a
year,
joined
with
the
county
school
board
so
that
they
could
legally
hire
a
superintendant
of
the
schools.
otherwise,
the
schools
went
on,
the
county
school
board
ran
the
schools'
business
as
usual.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
was
no
complaint,
no
question
at
all
on
the
part
of
the
city
school
officials
of
the
city
council
numbers
as
to
the
resistance
that
the
county
school
was
putting
up
to
this
lawsuit
to
desegregate
the
schools.
and,
even
after
the
new
kent
case,
they
now
properly
filed
motion
for
relief
in
light
of
the
new
kent,
the
county
school
board
was
successful
by
one
way
or
another
by
proposing
plans
that
obviously
would
not
work
a
series
or
everything
that
they
successfully
held
of
inevitable
for
a
full
year.
until
the
district
court
considering
that
the
county
board
had
repeatedly
failed
and
virtually
refused
to
propose
an
adequate
desegregation
plan
as
to
the
plaintiffs
would
prepare
a
plan
which
we
did
in
the
sense
that
that's
a
plan
that's
in
operation
in
--
in
the
schools
right
now.
and
when
the
court
announced
that
it
would
adopt
that
plan
and
that
also
being
made
in
june
of
1969.
but
the
taste
of
a
hard-worked
victory
didn't
last
very
long
because
suddenly,
final
result
hadn't
been
another
ball
game.
on
july
23rd,
when
the
county
school
board
sought
to
have
the
court
make
amendments
to
the
plan
that
the
plaintiffs
had
offered,
they
would
desire
--
considered
administratively
desirable
and
they
were
not
objected
to
by
the
plaintiffs.and
the
court
taking
that
matter
on
advisement
was
advised
that
the
--
by
the
county
school
board
that
they
may
have
to
come
back
to
submit
another
plan
if
the
city
children
withdrew
from
the
school
system.
and
that
remark
the
literate
plaintiff's
counsel
to
their
counter
attack
that
was
then
being
developed
by
the
city
of
emporia.
we
found
that
on
july
7,
the
count
--
city
council
had
sent
a
letter
to
the
county
board
of
supervisors
and
the
county
school
board
and
their
legal
adviser
which
the
letter
is
printed
in
the
appendix
at
page
56.
the
letter
takes
note
of
the
federal
court's
decision,
desegregate.
and
the
second
paragraph
of
the
complaint
and
we'll
quote,
“the
directive
plan
becomes
even
more
unpalatable
when
the
school
records
reflects
those
students
of
a
city
who
attend
to
combine
school
system
are
not
contributing
to
the
imbalance
which
apparently
led
the
court
to
order
school
class
relocations,
bussing,
et
cetera.”
the
county
was
by
then
better
requested
to
transfer
to
the
city
the
title
to
all
school
property
sighted
within
the
city.
and
in
return,
the
county
was
promised
that
upon
payment
of
tuition,
the
county
students
might
attend
the
city
schools
on
a
first
come,
first
serve
basis.
and
we
think
it
obvious
that
they
were
referring
to
the
white
students
of
the
county.
as
if
the
--
if
they
had
been
anticipating
the
black
students
of
the
county
also
attending
the
schools
had
been
no
real
purpose
for
their
separating
the
schools.
this
is
just
one
of
the
many
evidences
in
this
record
justifying
the
district
court's
finding
that
emporia's
decision
to
secede
from
the
county
was
racially
motivated.
from
the
beginning,
the
city's
concern
was
with
the
1880
black
county
children,
two-third
--
three-fourths
i
believe,
were
the
plaintiff
class
who
as
the
city
officials
sought,
calls
a
racial
imbalance
which
had
required
the
desegregation
order.
on
july
14,
1969,
the
minutes
of
that
time
the
appendix
at
page
62
and
we
think
that
they
are
the
essence
of
the
plaintiff's
case
here.
on
july
14th,
the
city
council
admit
publicly
on
a
special
session.
they
leave
--
those
minutes
leave
no
doubt
as
to
the
purpose
of
the
assembly
was
to
the
motivation
as
though
--
of
those
who
addressed
the
assembly
including
the
council
meetings
--
the
council
members.
merely
announced
and
we
quote,
“the
purpose
of
the
meeting
is
to
take
action
on
the
establishment
of
a
city
school
system
to
try
and
save
a
school
system
for
the
city
of
emporia
and
greensville
county.”
he
further
--
later
said
that
the
city
of
emporia
and
greensville
county
are
as
one.
we
could
work
together
to
save
our
school
system.
and
cases
came
on
to
trial,
the
things
that
--
well,
we
had
to
say
about
the
officials
of
greensville
county
were
--
were
less
complimentary
and
we
get
the
idea
that
greensville
county
and
emporia
had
been
waging
along
--
long
drawn
out
war.
by
the
time
they're
making
this
decision
that
at
the
time
that
they're
under
--
really
under
the
impact
of
the
federal
court
order,
the
city
and
the
county
wanted
--
we
can
cooperate
and
still
see
if
our
school
system
and
carry
on
business
as
we
always
have.
mr.
langford
to
show
the
racial
interest
in
--
in
their
decision
of
the
racial
effect
in
that
decision,
chairman
of
the
city
school
board
gave
a
plan
based
on
judge
merritt's
ruling
and
percentages
of
negroes
at
each
school
for
the
first
seven
grades
if
judge
merritt's
order
would
--
would
be
allowed
to
go
into
effect.
you
cannot
read
the
minutes
of
the
meeting
without
seeing
that
the
thing
about
which
the
city
was
unhappy
was
the
fact
that
the
district
court
order
was
going
to
require
actual
desegregation
of
the
public
schools
of
greensville
county.
at
the
foot
of
page
65
and
--
for
me
to
say
minutes,
you'll
see
that
mr.
langford,
chairman
of
the
school
board,
told
the
council
that
approximately
500
county
children
could
attend
city
schools
if
the
city
obtained
the
buildings
it
wanted.
they
have
only
728
white
children
--
white
county
children
in
the
system.
now,
a
separate
system
offered
the
only
way
to
continue
to
insulate
these
children
from
that
mass
--
of
what
we
consider
mass
of
1888
black
children
who
lived
in
the
county.
and
that
was
what
was
to
be
accomplished
at
all
cost
even,
and
we
get
for
the
minutes,
even
if
it
required
moving
into
temporary
buildings
and
using
makeshift
equipment
as
amount
of
the
separation.
now,
at
the
interlocutory
hearing,
hearing
on
interlocutory
injunction
some
three
weeks
later,
the
man
responses
and
city
attorney's
leading
question
testified
that
the
primary
motive,
and
seeking
to
separate
was
to
provide
a
substantially
superior
education.
and
once
relate
that
the
december
plenary
hearing,
the
city
school
board
exhibited
an
elaborately
expensive
budget
which
the
school
board
saw
for
the
first
time
and
adopted
at
a
meeting
held
15
days
prior
to
the
trial
in
which
the
city
council
saw
for
the
first
time
and
adopted
the
meaning
two
--
two
nights
later.
but
in
july,
the
decision
to
secede
was
made,
the
whole
mark
quality
was
a
more
palatable
percentage
of
black
children.
and
the
physical
thinking
reflected
in
the
july
meeting
was
the
expression
of
the
mayor
that
city
system
wouldn't
cost
anymore
than
they
were
paying
being
with
the
county.
and
that
they
could
take
county
students
in
on
a
tuition
basis.
nothing
else
in
that
meeting,
only
questions
of
adolescence
sense
was
expressed.
that
was
i
think
in
--
in
july
when
the
city
school
board
was
instructed
to
take
immediate
steps
to
establish
a
school
division
from
the
city
of
emporia,
and
the
city
attorney
was
instructed
to
take
immediate
steps
to
effect
the
legal
separation
in
terms
of
the
equity
of
--
of
the
--
which
the
city
and
county
had
in
the
jointly
owned
--
in
the
jointly
owned
property.
july
31st,
the
city
school
board
published
a
notice
to
parents
that
they
should
--
city
parents
that
they
should
register
in
the
city
schools
and
in
--
but
that
notice
invited
the
county
parents
to
register
their
children
on
the
first
come
--
no
transportation
tuition
basis.
the
city
attorney
wasn't
quite
so
prompt
in
executing
his
direct
there
because
it
went
until
october
of
1969
that
he
filed
a
suit
to
have
the
state
court
invalidate
the
contract
if
the
contract
was
indeed
invalid.
and
for
some
reason,
the
court
of
appeals
was
in
the
impression
that
the
sequence
of
events
happened
at
first
in
june
of
1969,
the
city
attorney
advised
the
council
that
the
contract
was
void.
and
the
city
then
filed
action
in
the
state
courts
to
have
the
contract
invalidated.
and
then
the
parents
were
then
notified
that
the
city
children
would
attend
city
schools
has
been
--
the
plaintiffs
followed
the
supplemental
complaint
seeking
an
injunction,
but
things
didn't
happen
in
that
sequence.
the
notification
to
the
parents
was
dated
july
31st.
the
supplemental
complaint
was
filed
august
1st.
the
hearing
on
the
motion
for
the
interlocutory
injunction
was
august
8th
and
sometime
after
that
hearing,
the
council
doubt
this
was
advised
that
the
contract
might
be
successfully
attacked.
in
the
court
now
on
october
1st,
the
--
a
suit
for
--
for
that
purpose
was
filed
in
the
state
court.
now,
there
are
erroneous
empiric
questions
the
court
of
appeals
seems
to
have
stemmed
with
the
testimony
of
mr.
langford,
chairman
of
the
city
school
board
who
was
asked
by
the
city
attorney,
“when
did
you
obtain
a
lawyer
who
advised
you
that
the
contract
was
illegal
and
violative
of
the
constitution?”
and
his
answer
was
in
june.
but
on
cross
examination,
we
devote
that
the
advice
was
a
matter
--
something
to
him
as
an
individual,
he
was
not
a
member
of
the
council.
the
chairman
of
the
school
board
was
not
giving
at
a
meeting
of
the
school
board
of
the
city
council
or
any
other
group.
and
when
we
read
--
read
the
testimony
that
was
being
heard
at
the
august
interlocutory
hearing,
we
find
that
the
--
that
the
school
board
people
and
the
city
council
people
looked
upon
this
contract
as
a
formidable
obstacle.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
went
back
to
the
minutes
of
that
july
meeting
in
which
the
city
attorney
was
present.
this
followed
the
contract
as
being
something
that
might
be
of
a
void
by
mutual
consent
or
by
annexation
that
makes
you
a
territory
from
the
county.
the
contract
had
a
provision
had
a
provision
that
it
would
be
terminated
if
the
city
did
take
an
annexation.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
yes,
sir?
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
district
court's
findings
support
of
the
position.
it
gave
the
date
on
which
the
--
the
city
filed
its
lawsuit
this
october.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
the
district
court
found
that
the
--
he
found
the
order
is
mixed.
he
says
that
the
--
that
the
--
raised
and
motivated,
he
gave
them
credit
for
their
protestations
that
they
wanted
to
develop
a
better
school
system
but
he
could
not
close
his
eyes
to
the
fact
that
the
thing
that
--
that
triggered
the
entire
thing
was
his
order.
i
think
that's
a
fair
statement
of
it,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
but,
in
another
and
perhaps
more
important
aspect,
the
fourth
circuit
majority
misstated
the
facts
of
the
case.
the
circuit
court
sought
to
ascertain
the
primary
purpose
of
the
city
by
looking
to
the
projections
of
the
numbers
and
percentages
of
the
black
and
white
students
will
be
attending
the
two
systems.
the
city's
witness
had
predicted
a
48%
black
and
a
52%
white
ratio
in
the
city-operated
high
school,
in
a
similar
but
in
greater
ratio
in
the
city-operated
elementary
schools.
but
these
predictions
link
the
facts.
the
anticipated
return
of
10%
of
the
school
population
from
the
private
school
would
increase
the
white
percentage
of
the
high
school
to
56%.
this
--
there
is
some
talk
in
the
testimony
about
annexation
and
they
could
annex
outline
areas
of
the
county
and
--
and
increase
the
white
population
of
the
county
immeasurably.
well,
how
--
the
figure
isn't
given
and
this
is
the
part
that's
not
accurate
work.
and
then
as
--
face
the
reality
of
why
he's,
they
didn't
take
in
account
that
the
children
who
lived
in
the
county
wouldn't
manage
to
live
with
relatives
in
the
--
in
the
city
or
with
friends
or
people
who
had
moved
out
--
who
could
afford
to
move
from
the
county
into
the
city
or
into
the
newly
--
the
part
of
the
city
to
be
annexed
in
order
to
--
that
their
children
could
attend
the
public
schools.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
well,
i
think
there's
a
little
difficulty
to
keep
the
two
separate
because
one
--
one
bears
on
the
other
anyhow.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
i
might
--
i
--
i
find
it
difficult
to
really
think
that
the
figures
and
vicinities
make
no
difference
but,
when
i
look
at
the
entire
picture
of
whatever
happens
in
emporia
to
increase
the
white
majority
is
--
wanted
to
increase
the
black
majority
in
the
counties.
and
it
doesn't
take
a
lot
of
imagination
that
--
to
see
that
the
county
schools
would
become
for
all
intensive
purposes
or
remain
for
the
intensive
purposes
of
the
black
schools.
well,
if
they
--
few
shifts,
annexation
or
adjustments
or
tuition
basis
or
a
county
children
attend
the
city
schools
on
tuition
basis
that
the
white
children
would
remain
out
of
the
school
sighted
in
the
county
just
as
they
have
remained
of
those
schools
during
the
freedom
of
choice
and
during
(inaudible).
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
i
am
suggesting
that.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
that
--
that's
what
would
--
would
happen
and
i
think
the
--
i
think
that's
fairly
what
the
--
what
the
council
meant
when
it
was
trying
to
negotiate
with
the
city,
whit
--
with
this
county.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
but
to
get
the
buildings
and
promising
the
county
children
they
come
in
on
a
tuition
basis
and
so
forth.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
i
--
i
--
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
at
present
of
what
the
--
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
--
of
what
the
emporia
proposed.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
at
the
present,
the
--
the
plan
that
the
plaintiffs
proposed
and
the
--
and
the
district
court
approved
is
in
operation
and
it
has
been
in
operation
for
two
and
a
half
years.
so
that
the
grades
one,
two
and
three
of
children
from
all
over
the
area
attended
the
emporia
elementary
school
and
grades
10,
11
and
12
from
children
all
over
the
area,
both
county
and
city
had
presently
attend
the
high
school
and
had
been
doing
so
for
two
and
half
years.
it
happens
that
we
got
the
injunction
entirely
and
the
district
court
gave
the
injunction
to
protect
this
order
and
the
order
went
into
effect
and
--
and
--
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
i
--
as
i
said
that
--
that
these
at
the
present,
the
best
figures
that
we
have
is
that
the
city
had
543
white
children
and
580
negro
children.
the
county
had
728
white
children
and
1888
negro
children.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
728
white,
1888
black.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
that's
correct.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
as
the
record
--
though
our
--
our
updated
figures
which
is
--
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
but
the
record
will
show
--
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
the
record
would
show
on
page
28,
297
of
the
appendix.
in
the
emporia
elementary
school,
that's
30.1%
white
and
69.9%
negro.
and
the
senior
high
school,
that's
in
the
city
--
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
44.9%
white
and
55.1%
negro.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
that
--
that's
quite
a
bit
of
--
we'd
like
to
suggest
that
the
method
that
the
circuit
used
to
--
divine
purpose
from
projection
was
--
was
not
a
valid
method
that
the
only
--
the
best
way
we
know
what
people's
purpose
are
--
as
what
they
say
the
--
the
purpose
is
at
the
time
they're
making
the
decision.
and
the
time
that
they're
making
decision
was
when
we
--
when
we
read
this
--
read
the
minutes.
at
that
time,
i'll
read
what
they
were
doing
and
saying
at
that
time,
the
purpose
is
all
too
clear
and
that
was
to
get
from
out,
from
under
the
district
court's
order.
we
also
would
like
to
suggest
that
the
circuit
formed
a
rule
of
--
ascertain
the
dominant
purpose.
but
we
think
it
here,
did
not
--
it
applied
that
rule
rather
than
remand
to
the
district
court
for
him
to
have,
made
the
assessment
in
the
light
of
that
rule.
we
think
that
in
any
aspect
of
this
case,
the
--
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed
by
any
one
of
six
reasons.
one,
any
validity
could
possibly
attach
to
the
fourth
circuit's
requirement
of
a
balancing
of
benign
purpose
against
the
constitutional
imperative.
then,
this
--
we're
going
to
read
new
rule
as
we
said,
the
case
should
have
been
remanded
to
the
district
court
who
made
the
initial
judgment
and
the
balancing.
we
suggest
that
the
proposed
balancing
test
is
invalid.
that
the
constitution
commands
that
the
school
systems
be
desegregated
and
it
makes
no
exception
to
permit
that
command
to
be
subordinated
to
notions
of
quality,
education,
anything
else
also
benign.
and
what
we
have
here
was
a
system
they
could
point
to
the
beautiful
school
system
they
have
for
emporia.
they
omit
the
fact
that
the
three
force
of
the
plaintiff
class
is
going
to
be
automatically
cut
other
than
beautiful
system.
and
i
don't
think
that
the
constitution
allows
us
to
balance
the
rights
of
those
children
against
the
proposed
benign
purposes.
we
think
that
--
as
was
said,
that
we
think
the
fourth
circuit
here,
in
--
in
trying
ascertain
or
ignoring
the
motivations
and
purposes
as
expressed
with
as
the
fact
was
going
on
rather
than
try
to
ascertain
them
from
some
projections.
we
think
that
the
district
court
--
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
--
was
correct
--
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
we
would
to
submit
--
i'll
save
the
rest
of
our
counter
rebuttal.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
thank
you
--
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
that's
right.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
i
think
it
had.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i
live
there.
and
if
emporia
had
1965
decided,
and
made
in
a
such
decision,
you
could've
knocked
me
over
with
a
feather.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
but
suppose
they
had
--
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
i
think
it
probably
would
have
had
the
power.
if
anything
like
i
believe
is
--
would
happen
in
emporia
that
--
had
emporia
--
or
had
emporia,
you're
saying,
created
a
unitary,
nonracial
school
system
as
early
as
1965,
would
the
district
court
have
had
power
to
eliminate
the
lines
and
expand
the
school
system
to
--
to
--
i
think
it
could
have
if
the
necessities
would've
required
it.
if,
as
a
result
of
that
or
even
without
result,
if
it
had
meant
that
the
children
in
the
county
were
attending
what
in
effect
were
racially
segregated
schools
because
that
--
if
it
--
if
it
meant
that
the
children
of
the
county
were
attending
racial
identifiable
schools
were
being
denied
equal
protection
of
laws,
i
think
the
district
court
could
take
--
could
use
the
command
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
state,
not
to
a
city,
not
to
a
county,
to
provide
equal
education
opportunities
for
all
the
children
in
the
state
where
as
far
as
that
is
practical.
so,
i
--
i
wouldn't
have
in
a
whole
lot
of
problem
if
--
if
the
evidence
demonstrated
the
necessity
for
that
--
for
the
district
court
to
have
erased
the
lines
and
--
and
required
one
school
system.
because
after
all,
the
--
that
doctrine
of
federalism
does
not
recognize
the
state's
(inaudible)
to
base
the
command
to
the
state,
not
to
denying
the
first
within
its
jurisdiction
of
the
state
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
and
that
is
the
basis
for
this
entire
line
of
litigation
now.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
the
district
court
found
that
the
--
that
the
emporia's
plan
of
proposal
was
racially
motivated.
he
says
on
page
--
well,
now,
he
--
he
said
that
the
--
the
motives
were
mixed
and
he
does
not
discount
the
racial
motivation.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
on
page
307
--
307
of
the
appendix,
right
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
“the
court
finds
that
in
a
sense,
race
was
a
factor
into
this
city's
decision
to
secede.”
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
the
court
of
appeals
furnished
the
board
and
the
district
court's
finding
that
race
was
a
factor.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
or
the
decision,
this
is
to
become
a
city,
i
--
i
think
it's
immaterial
to
our
consideration
here.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
in
our
decision
to
secede
from
the
school
system
--
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
--
is
the
thing
that
the
district
court
was
addressing
--
which
found
race
as
been
a
motivating
factor.
and
i
don't
think
it's
a
--
i
don't
think
that
conclusion
is
unavoidable.
we
just
look
at
the
minutes
of
july
14,
1969
when
they
made
the
decision
and
look
at
the
effort
and
look
at
the
things
that
they
did,
even
the
resolution
of
the
city
school
board
asking
the
state
board
to
create
them
a
separate
school
division
points
to,
every
plea
of
it
points
to
the
district
court
orders
the
things
which
they
were
unhappy.
the
--
the
being
unhappy
about
the
poverty
of
the
school
system
came
as
a
matter
--
after
the
application
for
an
injunction
as
a
matter
of
preparation
for
trial.
the
question
was
asked
whether
we
have
a
private
school
but
mr.
warriner
correctly
added
an
--
answered
that
we
don't
have
private
schools
in
the
county
of
greensville.
but
in
the
neighboring
county
of
brunswick,
there
is
a
private
school
wherein
a
considerable
number
of
white
children
do
attend
the
private
school
there.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that's
--
i
think
that's
in
the
record,
the
testimony
of
the
mayor
some
--
somewhere
later
first
to
the
--
people
who
had
--
who
had
gone
to
the
private
school
in
the
neighboring
county
of
brunswick.
you
get
only
across,
out
of
which
would
be
about
20
miles
away
from
emporia.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
well,
my
--
well,
it's
difficult
for
me
to
say
what
judge
meritt
meant.
i
can
say
the
evidence
he's
looking
at
and
i
think
the
evidence
he
is
looking
at
was
the
fact
that
the
people
took
into
consideration
when
they
made
the
decision
to
secede,
they
took
into
consideration
as
--
as
shown
by
their
minutes,
the
percentages
of
blacks
that
will
be
in
the
schools
under
judge
meritt
decision.
the
chairman
of
the
school
board
came
to
the
council
meeting
armed
with
that
information,
the
testimonies
went
by
the
superintendent's
office
to
get
it.
so,
you
could
carry
that
information
to
the
council
--
to
the
council
meeting
at
which
the
formal
decision
to
secede
was
made.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
that's
correct.
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
i
recall
that
and
this
is
the
testimony,
sir.
but
again,
i
go
back
to
letter
of
july
14
and
i
find
two
references
to
quality
education
and
i
get
that
the
whole
market
quality
there
was
the
palatable
racial
mix
in
the
schools.
i
mean,
i
--
i
--
that
--
that's
the
impression
i
get
from
reading
the
minutes
of
--
of
july
14
where
they
made
the
decision
as
what
they
were
concerned
about.
they
weren't
concerned
in
spending
money
then
because
their
only
question
of
money
was
the
mayor's
suggestion
that
we
can
operate
city
schools
as
--
as
--
cheaply.
it
was
much
money
as
we're
paying
the
county
and
we
can
take
county
students
in
on
a
tuition
basis.
and
i
can't
omit
the
fact
even
though
now,
the
city
can
protest
that
no
county's
children
will
come
into
--
come
into
the
city.
when
they
decided
to
secede,
their
purpose
was
to
let
children
come
in
on
a
county
basis
and
that
can
not
be
denied.
and
there
was
--
i
have
mentioned
in
my
original
argument
that
the
town
could
have
had
a
separate
school
system
even
when
it
was
a
town.
the
statute
for
that
is
printed
in
the
--
in
our
brief,
i
would
like
to
--
also
to
call
attention
the
--
on
page
--
appendix
4
of
the
petitioner's
brief,
section
2299
which
governs
when
city
contracts
with
--
with
county
to
furnish
facilities.
but
there
is
a
statutory
provision
in
a
--
provided
and
the
city
--
and
the
statute
provides
the
city
representation
on
the
school
board.
and
while
we're
at
that,
i
might
even
point
out
that
the
present
school
board
does
have
one
black
member
who
--
if
my
recollection
is
correct,
have
been
appointed
there
sometime
after
the
court's
decision
to
desegregate
schools,
and
i
point
out
also
that
the
evidence
shows
that
two
of
the
members
of
the
--
of
the
school
board
live
in
the
city
of
emporia.
so,
there
was
that
--
that
sort
of
open
warfare
between
emporia
and
--
and
its
neighbors
in
greensville
county.
there
has
been
a
quite
a
bit
of
cooperation
even
to
the
point
as
we
can
in
--
that
taking
into
position
before
the
district
court
will
in
--
in
our
injunctive
proceedings
to
protect
the
district
court's
order.
yes,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
samuel
w.
tucker
thank
you.
