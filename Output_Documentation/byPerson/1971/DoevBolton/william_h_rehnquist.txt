justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mrs.
hames,
is
there
any
limit
to
the
judicial
notice
which
we
can
take?
i
mean,
is
last
sunday’s
newspaper
a
perfectly
permissible
thing
to
rely
on
in
deciding
a
case
like
this?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mrs.
hames,
i
suppose
doctors
are
not
alone
in
being
eager
to
have
their
profession
or
occupation
wholly
taken
out
from
state
regulation.
wouldn’t
a
lot
of
professional
associations,
other
than
doctors,
cheerfully
subscribe
to
that
notion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
yet
professions
and
occupations
have
been
traditionally
regulated
by
the
state
for
a
long
time.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i
think--
don’t
you
think
your
argument
is
on
stronger
ground
there
than
to
tell
us
how
the
georgia
medical
association
last
month
decided
it
didn’t
want
any
regulation?
that
doesn’t
really
bear
on
the
constitutional
issue
here,
does
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
bakers
in
lochner
versus
new
york
didn’t
want
any
regulation
either.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mrs.
beasley,
are
you
claiming
that
if
i
bring
a
1983
action
in
the
georgia
court
and
the
court,
after
granting
a
hearing,
decides
if
i
lose,
i
didn’t
have
a
constitutional
right
under
19--
that
was
secured
by
anything,
then
the
court
never
had
jurisdiction
in
the
first
place?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
isn’t
that
what
the
court
has
to
hear
and
determine
and
doesn’t
jurisdiction
mean
the
power
to
hear
and
determine
and
decide
against
a
plaintiff?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
at
least
got
to
argue
whether
or
not
their
constitutional
right
exists.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mrs.
beasley,
supposing
that
the
georgia
legislature
on
evidence
presented
before
one
of
its
committees
were
to
determine
that
there
had
been,
say,
more
than
50%
fatalities
in
connection
with
open
heart
surgery
that
had
been
performed
in
georgia
and,
as
a
result
of
that,
the
legislature
were
to
enact
a
law
prohibiting
open
heart
surgery
in
the
state
of
georgia.
on
your
theory,
would
that
be
a
constitutional
exercise
of
legislative
power?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mrs.
beasley,
i
take
it
that
the
state,
in
making
its
determination
as
to
what
sort
of
a
statute
it
will
enact
and
what
rights
it
will
support,
need
not
choose
only
from
those
guaranteed
by
the
federal
constitution.
