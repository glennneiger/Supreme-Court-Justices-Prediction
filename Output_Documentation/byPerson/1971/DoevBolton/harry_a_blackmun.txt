justice
harry
a.
blackmun
are
those
things
something
that
goes
to
legislative
judgment
rather
than
to
constitutional
evaluation?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
you
were
just
talking
about
statistics,
however,
and
recent
reports
in
this
kind
of
thing,
rather
than
jcah.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
you
mean
recognized
authority,
you
mean
there
are
no
others?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
“a.”
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
don’t
you
think
that
there
are
other
factors
there
that
the
more
complicated
cases
go
into
hospitals
and
more
complicated
patients
are
in-patients
rather
than
out-patients?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mrs.
hames,
let
me
inquire
here.
would
you
oppose
a
georgia
statute
which
said
that
an
abortion
must
be
performed
by
a
licensed
physician
and
may
not
be
performed
by
a
midwife
or
a
registered
nurse
or
something
of
that
kind?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
then
you’re
making
a
constitutional
issue
out
of
these
new
facts.
what
i’m
asking
you
is
whether
you
feel
a
georgia
statute
confining
the
abortion
process
to
a
physician
would
be
unconstitutional.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
the
constitutionality
will
change
depending
on
the
advancement
of
medical
knowledge.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
then
you
are
conceding
that
the
state
may
license
an
abortion
facility.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
i
take
it
i
heard
you
correctly
that
among
its
requirements
it
may
require--
it
may
list
proximity
to
a
licensed
hospital.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i’m
asking
you
whether
you
would
regard
this
as
a
constitutional
restriction.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
i
also
take
it
that
what
you
said
before
that
you’re
reserving
the
right
to
say
that
it
isn’t
constitutional
20
years
since.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mrs.
beasley,
if
my
memory
serves
me
correctly,
the
last
time
around
i
asked
you
why
the
situation
as
to
incest
was
left
out
of
the
georgia
statute.
were
you--
have
you
been
able
to
trace
that
down
at
all?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
other
question
that
i
have,
while
i
have
you
interrupted,
in
your
list
of
supplemental
authorities
which
you
submitted
without
any
particular
explanation,
there
are
some
what
i
take
it
to
be
proposed
bills
in
georgia
which
would
change
your
current
statute,
am
i
correct
in
that
impression?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
would
you
have
some
comment
on
those?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
that
connection,
mrs.
hames,
i
don’t
recall
that
i
found
it
mentioned
in
your
brief
either
and
perhaps
you
would
tell
me
why
it
wasn’t
even
footnoted.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
where
do
you
get
the
authority
to
say
that
medical
schools
are
not
now
using
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
would
it
surprise
you
if
some
are
using
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
maybe
one
way
to
answer
that
is
that
kidney
stone
treatment
is
certainly
different
than
it
was
400
years
b.c.,
but
you
must
concede
that
it
goes
directly
to
the
point,
doesn’t
it?
i
will
give
no
deadly
medicine
to
anyone
who
ask
that
ties
it
in
to
suicide,
nor
suggest
any
such
council
and,
in
light
manner,
i
will
not
give
to
a
woman
of
causerie
to
produce
abortion
or,
in
another
translation,
nor
will
i
make
a
suggestion
to
this
effect.
similarly,
i
will
not
give
to
a
woman
an
abortive
remedy.
now,
this
is
the
definitive
statement
of
medical
ethics
for
centuries,
and
yet
neither
briefs,
in
your
side
of
the
case,
thinks
even
a
reference
to
it.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
of
course
the
oath
was
formulated
at
a
time
when
abortion
was
common
and
widely
practiced
historically.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
are
those
things
something
that
goes

judgment
rather
