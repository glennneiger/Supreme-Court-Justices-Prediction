justice

marshall
well,
if
the
doctor
is
already
protected,
you
do
not
have
any
criminal
prosecution
to
any
other
operations,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
georgia?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
why
then
he
ask
for
protection
on
abortions?
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
abortion
statute
is
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
excuse
me.
go
ahead.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i’m
a
little
confused.
you
say
that
the
state
is
interested
in
protecting
the
life
of
the
fetus
and
yet
the
state
statute,
under
certain
conditions,
allows
the
death
of
the
fetus.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any
other
statute
of
georgia
which
says
under
certain
conditions
you
can
kill
somebody?
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
you
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
there
any
statute
in
georgia
that
says
that
a
commission
of
three
people
could
decide
whether
a
man
lives
or
dies?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
there
any
statute
which
says
three
doctors
can
decide
whether
a
man
lives
or
dies
or,
obviously--
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
isn’t
a
statute.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
can
say
three
doctors
can
decide
as
to
whether
you
what
you
claim
as
a
living
fetus
with
the
exact
same
rights
as
a
grown
person,
can
be
killed.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
is
it
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
a
living
being
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
have
a
right
with
the
provision
of
three
doctors
to
kill
the
“human
being.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
have
great
problem
with
this
human
being
point.
i
think
that’s
what
my
problem
is,
and
do
you
have
to
go
so
far
to
sustain
your
position
and
to
say
that
the
fetus
is
a
human
being.
why
don’t
you
treat
it
as
a
fetus?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
why
i
was
mistaken.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
can’t
give--
you
can’t
recognize
the
ninth
amendment
for
the
fetus
and
not
recognize
the
ninth
amendment
for
the
mother,
can
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
the
