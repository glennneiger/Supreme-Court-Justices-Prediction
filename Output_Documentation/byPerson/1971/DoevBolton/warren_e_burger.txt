very

chief

i
suppose
when

to

chief

but
you
wouldn’t

would
you,
that
the

have
authority
to

a
statute
or
could
sustain
a
statute
that
would
forbid
tonsillectomies,
for
example?
chief

warren
e.
burger
well,
suppose
the

pointed
to
the
fact
that
sometimes
people
die
in
the
process
of
having
a
tonsils
removed,
which
they
do,
perhaps
one
out
of
every
200,000
or
some
such
figure.
chief

warren
e.

and
on
that
grounds,
they
were

you
think
the

sustain
that
against

on

well,
it

it
