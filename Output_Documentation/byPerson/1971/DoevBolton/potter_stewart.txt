justice
potter
stewart
mrs.
hames,
just
before
you
sit
down,
perhaps
you
made
this
clear
with
yourself,
but
it
is
not
very
clear
to
me.
you
are
appealing
here
because
while
you
want
at
least
a
partial
victory
by
way
of
a
declaratory
judgment,
you
were
denied
of
injunction
and
that
is
what
technically
giving
you
a
right
to
appeal
directly
to
this
court,
the
denial
of
the
injunction.
you
are
arguing
now
that
you
should
have
wholly
had
a
complete
victory
on
the
merits
of
the
entire
statute,
should
have
been
stricken
and
also
that
an
injunction
should
have
issued.
and
i
am
asking
you
in
that
connection,
that
second
connection
whether
the
georgia
authorities
had
disregarded
or
manifested
an
intent
to
disregard
the
federal
district
courts’
declaratory
judgment
of
the
invalidity
of
the
substantive
part
of
this
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
you
were
here
i
think
in
the
argument
of
the
previous
case
where
that
was
true
and
apparently
in
texas.
justice
potter
stewart
we
do
not
have
here,
any
question
of
the
application
of
2283.
there
was
no
pending
state?
justice
potter
stewart
of
any
kind,
was
it
simply
criminal?
