ms.
margie
pitts
hames
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
decision
of
the
northern
district
of
georgia
and
also
a
three-judge
court
which
declared
portions
of
the
georgia
abortion
statute
unconstitutional
that
upheld
certain
procedural
requirement
and
refused
in
issuing
injunction
in
support
of
the
declaratory
judgment.
the
parties
here
included
mary
doe,
a
pregnant
woman,
a
married
pregnant
woman,
doctors,
nurses,
ministers,
social
workers
and
family
planning
and
abortion
council
organization.
they
found
this
action
as
a
class
action
seeking
to
represent
members
of
their
various
classes.
the
district
court
below
found
that
the
right
of
privacy
included
the
right
to
terminate
an
unwanted
pregnancy
and
that
the
statute
which
limited
the
reasons
therefore
was
unduly
unrestricted
and
overly
broad.
the
district
court
found
that
mary
doe
and
her
class
was
entitled
to
declaratory
relief.
the
physicians
even
though
they
were
found
to
have
standing
and
other
parties
were
said
to
have
insufficient
collision
of
interest.
this
question
was
brought
to
this
court
also.
this
case
stands
on
jurisdictional
grounds
similar
to
the
roe
versus
wade
case
which
has
just
been
argued
except
that
no
plaintiff
in
this
case
had
pending
from
the
prosecutions
outstanding
against
them.
it
is
our
position
that
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
is
much
like
the
case
in
wisconsin
versus
constantineau
where
that
case
–-the
statute
in
that
case
outrighted
against
the
third
parties
rights.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
yes,
your
honor
they
are.
the
statute
in
wisconsin
versus
constantineau
outright
against
the
third
parties
rights
and
sure
you
would
recall
that
with
the
posting
of
the
alcoholic
case.
the
criminal
penalty
there
ran
against
the
bartender
who
sold
alcoholic
beverages
so
that
the
woman,
that
posted
party
would
never
have
an
opportunity
to
assert
her
right,
that
was
a
woman
in
the
case,
in
the
defense
of
the
criminal
action
against
the
bartender.
here
we
have
a
like
situation
of
the
third
parties
rights.
mary
doe
who
would
never
have
an
opportunity,
we
say
adequately
to
assert
her
constitutional
rights
in
the
defense
of
the
doctor’s
criminal
prosecution.
georgia
like
texas,
it
is
not
a
crime
for
a
woman
to
submit
to
an
abortion
or
to
abort
herself.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
i
cannot
cite
you
a
case
expressed
but
it
is
my
recollection
that
the
georgia
courts
have
held
that
she
would
not
be
so
guilty.
her
husband
or
her
paramour
could
have
been
charged
but
to
my
recollection
is
not
going
to
charge
against
the
woman
as
a
conspirator.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
no,
your
honor,
it
was
not.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
the
hospital
was
not
thought
to
be
an
indispensable
party
since
the
hospital
abortion
committee
was
a
statutory
committee
created
by
the
statute
or
the
abortion
statute.
it
was
our
opinion
that
under
the
georgia
law
dealing
with
the
attorney
general
in
his
powers
which
gave
him
powers
over
our
board’s
committee
and
commissions
as
to
matters
of
law
that
this
was
sufficient
to
bring
that
interest
into
operation.
also,
the
abortion
committee
is
a
revolving
committee
and
it
would
involve
the
various
doctors
from
time
to
time.
most
hospitals
in
georgia
have
their
staff
members
sit
on
the
abortion
committee
so
that
it
changes
from
month
to
month
or
from
day
to
day
even.
so
that
it
was
felt
that
bringing
the
state
attorney
general
in
as
a
defendant
in
the
case
would
be
sufficient
to
raise
the
state
statutory
abortion
committee
in
the
exercise
of
a
statutory
authority
given
to
them.
mary
doe
was
a
22-year-old
woman.
she
was
married
and
pregnant
at
the
time
that
this
action
was
filed.
her
reasons
for
abortion
were
several.
she
had
three
previous
children.
two
of
whom
had
been
taken
from
her
custody
by
state
authorities
because
of
her
inability
to
care
for
them.
and
the
third
she
had
placed
with
adopted
parents
at
birth.
she
applied
to
the
public
hospital
for
an
abortion
which
she
was
eligible
for
free
medical
care.
her
application
there
was
denied.
she
later
planned
through
her
private
physician
to
a
private
hospital
abortion
committee
where
her
abortion
application
was
approved.
she
did
not
obtain
the
abortion,
however
because
she
did
not
have
the
cash
to
deposit
entire
hospital
bill
in
advance.
the
georgia
statute
is
--
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
yes,
your
honor
there
is
and
found
in
the
original
file
which
has
been
sent
up
to
this
court.
this
is
sealed
affidavit
which
is
signed
in
mary
doe’s
real
name.
it
was
signed
and
filed
with
the
court
originally
in
the
proceeding.
she
was
present
at
the
hearing
of
this
case
and
we
offered
to
have
her
testify
and
disclose
her
identity
and
the
court
did
not
deem
that
necessary.
we
found
that
in
the
fictitious
name
to
protect
her
then
not
to
be
involved
in
embarrassment
but
that
originally,
in
fact
they
do
not
follow
in
this
court.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
it
was
not
with
her
consent
your
honor.
as
i
recall,
that
was
for
the
protection
of
her
children.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
yes,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
chief
justice.
our
major
contingent
here
or
appeal
here
is
directed
primarily
at
the
procedural
requirements
less
standing
by
the
district
court
below.
our
statute
does
provide
that
right
as
a
ground
for
abortions.
also,
a
fetal
malformation
endangered
to
the
life
of
the
woman
or
serious
and
permanent
danger
to
her
health.
these
were
the
reasons
that
the
court
declared
unconstitutional
however,
there
were
other
good
reasons
–-
good
and
sufficient
reasons
for
an
abortion.
the
requirement
said
unless
standing
are
the
residency
requirement
that
the
woman’s
doctor
have
at
least
two
consultants
who
concur
on
his
opinion
and
approval
by
hospital
abortion
committee
of
at
least
three
more
doctors
and
the
accredited
licensed
hospital
provision.
this
accreditation
requirement
is
by
the
joint
commission
on
hospital
accreditation
of
chicago,
illinois
corporation
which
is
a
private
organization.
there
are
other
many
reporting
requirements
and
miscellaneous
provisions
left
in
the
statute
but
i
wish
to
direct
the
court’s
attention
to
the
hospital
abortion
committee,
the
accreditation
and
residency
requirement.
it
is
the
appellant’s
contention
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
debate
to
fetal
life
problem
in
this
case
because
if
the
district
court
below
recognized,
this
statute
is
aimed
at
protecting
the
health
of
women.
judge
smith
in
delivering
the
opinion
of
the
court
found
that
the
whole
thrust
of
the
present
georgia
statute
is
to
treat
the
problem
as
a
medical
one.
the
only
compelling
state
interest
however
that
has
been
asserted
by
the
state,
is
the
interest
in
preserving
fetal
life
and
then
taking
this
approach
to
the
statute,
the
state
finds
itself
in
a
very
inconsistent
position
we
feel,
that
is
affirming
that
fetuses
from
the
moment
of
conception
have
the
right
to
develop
and
be
born
and
yet
having
abandoned
such
right
as
to
those
fetuses
the
product
of
rape
or
which
may
like
to
be
malformed
or
those
which
may
endanger
the
life
or
health
of
the
woman.
further
the
state
is
in
the
inconsistent
position
of
financing
a
family
planning
program
which
daily
distributes
--.
excuse
me.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
that
is
correct.
right
both
forceful
and
statutory
which
is
girls
13
years
and
younger
in
georgia.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
yes,
that
is
one
of
the
exceptions.
i
will
always
model
after
the
model
penal
code
of
american
law
institute
version.
the
further
inconsistency
involves
the
financing
of
the
family
planning
program
which
distributes
further
department
of
public
health,
the
intrauterine
contraceptive
device
which
substantial
medical
opinion
has
destroyed
the
product
of
conception
or
prevent
implantation
of
the
fertilize
egg
or
embryo.
we
feel
that
if
the
state
has
such
an
unfettered
interest
in
fetal
life,
that
these
are
very
inconsistent
provisions.
thus
it
is
our
contention
that
the
statute
must
be
viewed
as
a
health
of
the
woman
directive
purpose
statute.
i
would
point
out
that
abortion
is
not
a
new
medical
procedure.
of
course
we
have
heard
a
lot
about
it
in
the
last
few
years.
but
it
is
one
that
has
been
extensively
performed
throughout
the
history
of
our
country
and
of
course
illegally.
because
of
the
abortion
statutes,
the
great
majority
of
abortion
had
been
performed
by
unskilled
person,
those
at
least
equipped
to
take
care
of
the
health
problems.
doctors,
because
it
is
a
crime,
have
not
been
performing
abortion.
abortion
statutes
however,
had
not
stopped
the
abortions.
they
have
not
served
their
purpose
or
they
are
not
reaching
the
purpose
of
protecting
fetal
life.
the
fact
is
a
valid
purpose.
to
ascend
that
these
statutes
do
protect
fetal
life
is
to
ignore
the
actual
fact.
in
our
brief
and
in
the
many
amici
brief
filed
in
this
case,
there
is
extensive
citation
to
statistics
about
illegal
abortion
and
the
admission
of
patient
or
septic
abortions
that
is
the
incomplete
abortion
in
the
hospital
which
show
that
illegal
abortions
are
being
performed.
what
we
are
actually
talking
about
is
getting
abortion
out
of
the
illegal
arena
into
the
health
service
arena.
and
this
is
the
purpose
of
this
litigation.
i
would
point
out
that
illegal
abortion
and
the
complications
there
from
is
the
largest
single
cause
of
maternal
mortality
in
the
united
states.
therefore
abortion
statute
have
resulted
and
one
of
our
notions,
largest
health
problems.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
procedural
requirements
less
standing
by
the
court
below
had
virtually
manipulated
out
of
existence
the
right
to
terminate
an
unwanted
pregnancy
as
recognized
by
the
court.
the
decision
below
characterizes
the
decision
to
terminate
an
unwanted
pregnancy
as
a
personal-medical
decision.
in
commenting
about
the
procedural
requirement,
the
hospital
abortion
committee,
the
limitation
to
the
accredited
hospital,
the
court
said
that
the
state
has
an
interest
in
the
quality
of
healthcare
to
be
administered
to
its
citizen.
but
this
is
not
to
imply
that
the
present
procedures
are
the
best
means
of
control.
the
present
seems
to
be
unnecessarily
cumbersome
and
possibly
a
due
process
hazard.
this
was
the
observation
on
the
court
in
a
footnote
and
it
is
our
contention
that
these
procedures
are
so
cumbersome,
counseling
and
time
consuming
as
to
the
date,
mary
doe
and
members
of
her
class
and
doctors
and
members
of
their
class
of
various
rights.
of
course
there
is
an
inherent
time
factor
in
pregnancy
and
this
must
be
a
factor
considered.
first
trimester,
abortions
are
safer
than
late
abortions.
therefore
it
is
imperative
that
the
right
to
terminate
an
unwanted
pregnancy
be
efficiently
exercised.
mortality
and
complications
for
late
abortions
are
three
times
greater
after
12
weeks.
and
it
is
only
about
the
sixth
or
the
eighth
week
that
pregnancy
test
actually
become
accurate
or
the
degree
of
accuracy
is
such
that
to
predict
whether
one
is
pregnant
or
not.
so
that
we
actually
have
about
12
weeks
--
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
does
the
record?
i
am
sorry.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
no,
your
honor.
we
were
not
permitted
to
introduce
our
evidence
at
the
hearing
that
was
--
we
have
many
witnesses
to
testify
that
various
aspect
of
abortion
and
pregnancy.
i
am
sure
that
this
court
can
take
judicial
notice
on
many
medical
intricacies
which
would
disclose
that
this
is
fact.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
yes,
it
is.
from
my
recollection,
from
my
understanding
that
this
is
accepted
procedure
that
a
pregnancy
is
not
easily
detectable
until
after
the
sixth
week
and
accuracy
is
about
the
eighth
week.
the
requirement
that
a
physician
have
two
consultants
and
then
presents
the
case
to
the
abortion
committee.
it
is
un-civic,
an
unsuited
procedure
for
medical
treatment.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
there
are
many
committees
in
hospitals
or
that
have
committees
and
they
have
other
kinds
of
committees
but
these
do
not
make
decisions
about
constitutional
right
on
whether
or
not,
it
would
be
exercised
and
in
the
hospital
abortion
committee
being
a
statutory
committee
is
beyond
of
the
state
government,
we
can
contend
and
would
be
different
from
an
administration
committee
from
which
it
is
--
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
accreditation
standards
of
the
joint
commission
do
not
require
appointment
of
abortion
or
other
committees.
this
is
a
practice
that
has
developed
and
grown
up
and
i
think
it
grew
up
prior
to
the
american
law
institute
specifically
as
to
abortion
and
it
was
to
relieve
doctors
from
the
responsibility
of
making
this
decisions
solely
and
they
were
afraid
of
assuming
that
responsibility
because
of
the
criminal
sanctions
imposed
by
law.
therefore
they
have
their
hospitals
constitute
abortion
committee.
they
would
have
to
share
the
responsibility
for
such
a
decision.
the
operations
of
committees
or
the
hospitals,
of
course,
would
be
an
internal
matter
for
hospital
and
it
might
be
possible
that
a
committee,
that
a
hospital
could
continue
to
have
a
committee
to
govern
abortions
in
that
hospital.
however,
it
is
our
contention
that
the
right
to
terminate
a
pregnancy
should
not
be
controlled
by
statutory
committee
from
which
there
is
no
appeal,
where
there
is
no
opportunity
for
a
hearing,
the
woman
is
never
seen
by
the
members
of
the
committee.
she
is
never
told
where
her
abortion
was
denied.
and
her
doctor
at
many
times
is
not
even
permitted
to
come
and
present
her
case.
if
this
committee,we
feel
is
not
a
vehicle
which
could
properly,
determine
this
constitutional
right.
we
feel
that
it
is
as
the
court
said
below
in
medical-personal
decision
that
many
factors
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
have
an
abortion
are
personal
like
your
desire
to
have
only
two
children
on
the
family
size.
your
economic
status
is
a
matter
of
personal
knowledge.
this
is
not
a
matter
that
can
be
effectively
presented
to
a
committee.
a
doctor
could
not
possibly
present
all
these
matters
to
a
hospital
abortion
committee.
we
feel
that
this
committee
is
just
an
improper
vehicle
for
determining
the
right
to
terminate
an
unwanted
pregnancy.
additionally,
there
is
a
problem
of
the
doctor
and
he
feels
that
his
patient
should
have
an
abortion.
she
wants
an
abortion
but
he
must
submit
his
decision
not
only
to
concurrence
of
two
more
consultants
but
to
the
hospital
abortion
committee.
these
are
his
competitors,
his
professional
competitors.
there
are
doctors
in
his
community
who
decide
what
he
will
do
in
his
medical
practice.
it
is
the
position
of
the
doctors
that
this
infringes
their
right
to
practice
medicine
in
accordance
with
their
best
medical
judgment.
it
permits
the
committee
to
substitute
their
judgment,
their
religious
or
personal
views
for
those,
of
his
and
the
decision
rates
between
himself
and
his
patient.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
that
is
true
but
then
could
he
have
some
voice
in
arriving
at
the
standards
of
his
profession
and
that
the
application
of
his
professional
standards
would
not
be
designed
as
application
of
the
abortion
committees
on
personal
views.
i
think
that
these
are
matters
that
are
better
left
to
the
profession.
i
would
think
that
the
medical
profession
can
develop
its
standards,
the
american
college
of
obstetricians
and
gynecologists
has
taken
a
policy
that
when
an
abortion
is
requested
by
a
woman
and
there
are
no
contra-medical
indications
then
the
abortion
would
be
performed
without
even
the
necessity
of
the
consultant,
where
it
is
recommended
by
the
doctor
then
the
american
college
recommends
that
the
doctor
have
a
consultant
on
that
decision.
i
think
that
the
profession
can
develop
standards
and
that
this
is
where
it
should
be
controlled
rather
than
by
hospital
abortion
committee
sitting
in
a
quasi-judicial
situation.
i
would
point
out
that
the
hospital
(inaudible)

abortions
in
georgia
and
then
as
many
women
access
to
abortion
services,
105
of
georgia’s
candidates
have
no
accredited
hospital.
so
that
those
women
who
are
dependent
upon
their
county
hospital
for
free
medical
service
are
denied
by
virtue
of
this
hospital
accreditation
requirement.
there
--
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
there
are
284
hospitals
and
i
have
not
made
the
comparison
to
see.
only
abortions
that
only
been
found
in
22
counties
in
georgia.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
yes,
it
is
possible
your
honor
that
some
8
or
10
or
the
smaller,
less
populated
hospital
counties
could
have
that.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
down
the
lane
we
do.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
one
further
thing
as
to
hospitals.
the
new
york
experience
has
shown
that
abortion
in
clinics
is
a
relatively
safe
--
is
a
safe
procedure.
early
abortions
are
not
required
to
be
performed
in
hospitals.
and
if
we
have
this
requirement
or
did
not
have
the
limitation
to
accredit
the
hospitals
in
georgia
then
we
can
have
abortion
clinics
in
the
more
rural
areas.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
it
was
adopted
in
1968,
april
of
1968.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
that
is
correct.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
yes.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
that
is
correct
or
other
application
of
the
law
meaning
by
abortion
committees
of
hospitals.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
that
is
correct.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
as
to
the
nurses,
we
would
say
that
they
still
have
a
controversy
or
a
need
for
relief
because
they
too
are
not
permitted
to
practice
their
professions.
of
course,
they
would
not
be
independently
performing
abortion
but
would
be
assisting
doctors
so
that
there
is.
as
to
the
ministers
and
other
counselors
and
social
workers
who
wish
to
counsel
abortion
based
under
the
decision
below
which
said
that
abortion
are
obtainable
for
any
reason.
they
would
not
now
fear
the
prosecution
under
the
conspiracy
statute,
the
aiding
and
abetting
statute
for
counseling
abortion.
there
is
no
really
real
relief
needed
here.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
on
behalf
of
the
nurses,
yes,
your
honor
and
as
to
the
counselors,
it
is
our
contention
that
they
had
a
sufficient
collision
of
interest
for
the
declaratory
relief
that
have
been
granted
as
to
them.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
we
occupy
a
position
similar
to
texas
as
to
declaratory
relief.
we
have
a
statute
in
georgia
which
says
that
equity
will
not
interfere
in
the
administration
of
criminal
laws.
yes,
criminal
laws.
this
has
recently
been
construed
in
1968
to
prohibit
a
declaratory
judgment
and
equitable
relief
as
to
a
criminal
statute.
so
that
there
is
no
alternative
to
go
into
state
court
for
declaratory
relief
and
this
is
the
only
forum
in
which
we
contend
that
plaintiffs
to
assert
their
right.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
yes,
we
are
making
a
constitutional
argument
for
everyone
in
the
--
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
with
respect
to
including
the
first
amendment
argument
which
was
made
below
as
to
counseling
abortion.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
thank
you.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
no
mr.
justice,
there
has
been
no
manifestation.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
yes,
i
think
the
need
for
injunctive
relief
arises
from
the
fact
that
out
of
the
24
appellate
decisions
on
abortion
in
georgia,
13
of
those
have
involved
doctors
so
that
there
--
we
have
a
history
of
prosecution
of
doctors
in
georgia.
additionally,
the
law
has
continued
to
be
in
force
and
abortions
are
being
denied
for
unknown
reasons
by
the
hospital
abortion
committee
that
presents
a
very
real
need
for
injunctive
relief
at
--
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
we
do
not
know
why
they
are
denying
the
abortions
but
are
not
required
to
disclose
and
they
do
not
disclose.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
contractors.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
yes,
abortionists,
illegal
abortionist.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
yes,
non-physician.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
thank
you.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
just
a
few
things
mr.
chief
justice.
all
of
the
defendants
in
this
case
did
file
motion
to
dismiss
which
the
court
treated
as
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
the
judgment
of
the
court
specifies
that
in
page
87
of
the
appendix.
we
have
not
designated
constitutional
basis
for
our
case
but
i
would
like
to
say
that
we
contend
that
the
procedure
requirements
infringe
due
process
and
equal
protection
and
that
the
right
of
privacy
as
enunciated
in
griswold
of
course
is
their
basic
reliance.
i
would
commend
to
the
court
the
article
of
professor
miens(ph)
also
which
goes
into
the
abortion,
common-law
of
abortion
and
point
out
that
in
georgia,
abortion
before
quickening
was
only
a
misdemeanor
beginning
in
1876
and
prior
to
that
then,
it
was
not
crime
at
all.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
decision
in
the
northern
district
court
of
georgia
where
the
three-judge
court
below
held
portions
of
a
model
penal
code
type
abortion
statute
unconstitutional
and
upheld
other
provisions,
and
refused
to
issue
an
injunction
in
support
of
a
declaratory
judgment.
the
case
was
filed
on
behalf
of
mary
doe
a
pregnant
woman,
doctors,
nurses,
ministers,
social
workers,
and
family
planning
organizations
as
a
class
action
seeking
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief.
the
district
court
found
that
the
right
of
privacy
there
did
include
the
right
to
terminate
an
unwanted
pregnancy
without
hanging
the
case
on
any
particular
provision
in
the
constitution
that
rely
primarily
on
this
court’s
decision
in
griswold.
the
court
found
that
the
specification
of
three
reasons
for
abortion
in
our
statute
was
unduly
restrictive
and
overbroad.
mary
doe
was
given
a
declaratory
judgment.
however,
the
physicians
and
other
parties,
even
though
said
to
have
sufficient
standing,
lacked
sufficient
collision
of
interests
and,
therefore,
the
case
was
dismissed
as
to
them.
this
case
stands
on
similar
jurisdictional
grounds
as
the
roe
versus
white
case
which
we
just
heard.
i
would
only
point
to
two
cases
on
the
jurisdictional
point.
one
is
wisconsin
versus
constantineau
which
dealt
with
a
third
party’s
constitutional
right
there,
and
then
the
discussion
in
the
eisenstadt
versus
baird
case,
the
recent
case
of
this
court.
the
facts
of
this
case
involved
mary
doe
who
was
a
22-year-old
woman,
married.
she
had
given
birth
to
three
previous
children,
two
of
whom
had
been
taken
away
from
her
by
state
authorities
because
she
was
unable
to
care
for
them.
the
third
child,
she
was
required
by
her
husband
to
place
with
adoptive
parents.
mrs.
doe
requested
an
abortion
at
the
public
hospital
where
she
was
entitled
to
free
medical
service.
she
was
an
indigent
person,
by
the
way.
her--
mary
had
been
unstable,
and
during
the
pendency
of
her
pregnancy
her
husband
abandoned
her.
she
was
about
10
or
11
weeks
when
this
lawsuit
was
commenced,
and
she
subsequently
applied
to
private
physicians
in
atlanta
in
a
private
hospital
for
an
abortion
and
that
application
was
approved.
she
was
turned
down,
however,
by
the
public
hospital.
the
abortion
statute
in
georgia,
as
i
said,
is
modeled
after
the
model
penal
code
and
was
adopted
in
1968.
the
prior
law
was
adopted
in
1976
and
it
was
of
the
texas
type
to
save
the
life
of
the
woman
statute.
the
legislature
in
1968,
however,
permitted
abortion
for
three
reasons:
rape,
likelihood
of
grave
and
permanent
or
irremediable
fetal
malformation
and
danger
to
the
life
of
the
woman
or
serious
and
permanent
injury
to
her
health.
these
were
the
reasons
the
court
declared
unconstitutional.
they
left
standing,
however,
the
procedures
in
the
statute.
the
residency
requirement,
the
requirement
that
a
doctor
have
two
consultants,
the
hospital
abortion
committee
approval
requirement
of
at
least
three
more
doctors,
and
the
requirement
that
all
abortions
be
performed
in
accredited
licensed
hospitals,
that
is
those
accredited
by
the
joint
commission
on
hospital
accreditation,
and
there
were
several
other
reporting
requirements
that
were
left
standing.
appellants
here
contend
that
it’s
not
necessary
to
debate
the
fetal
life
problem
in
the
georgia
case
because,
as
the
district
court
recognized,
the
georgia
statute
is
aimed
at
protecting
the
health
of
the
woman.
judge
smith
said
that
the
whole
thrust
of
the
present
statute
is
to
treat
the
problem
as
a
medical
one.
the
only
compelling
interest
that
has
been
asserted
by
the
state,
however,
is
the
interest
in
preserving
fetal
life.
in
taking
this
position,
the
state
has
found
itself
in
a
very--
several
inconsistent
positions,
that
is
they
have
abandoned
the
fetuses
that
are
products
of
rape,
they
have
abandoned
those
that
might
likely
be
malformed,
and
they
have
abandoned
those
that
might
injure
the
life
or
the
health
of
the
woman,
so
that
if
the
state
claims
an
interest
in
fetal
life
there,
they
have
abandoned
some
and
are
protecting
others.
the
state
is
in
the
further
inconsistent
position
because,
under
its
public
health
code
and
family
planning
service
it
has--
as
a
medical
service,
inserted
several
thousand
intrauterine
devices
which
substantial
medical
opinion
holds
either
destroys
the
product
of
conception
or
prevents
implantation
of
the
fertilized
egg
or
embryo.
the
brief
on
behalf
of
the
state
has
argued
that
the
right
to
life
begins
at
the
moment
of
conception,
and
we
report
this
out
as
another
inconsistency
in
their
argument.
abortion
is
not
a
new
medical
procedure
or
maybe
it’s
not
a
new
procedure,
i
should
say.
illegal
abortions
have
been
performed
for
many
years.
there
aren’t
any
statistics
that
are
very
reliable
on
this,
but
writers
in
the
area
estimate
several
thousand
per
year
in
the
united
states
and
several
thousand
deaths
have
occurred
from
illegal
abortions.
i
think
the
real
abortion
that
this
court
is
faced
with
is
whether
abortion
is
going
to
be
made
a
legal
health
service
for
women
or
whether
it’s
going
to
be
kept
in
the
illegal
rim
and
handled
by
the
unskilled
so-called
non-medical
practitioners.
i
believe
i’ve
pointed
out
before
in
the
prior
argument
that
we
have
had
some-23--
25
cases
now
reported
involving
abortions
in
georgia
and
many
of
those
involved
nurses
or
contractors
and,
i
believe,
a
plumber
in
one
case,
and
you
can
find
those
kinds
of
cases
all
over
the
united
states,
woman
placing
their
hands--
their
life
in
the
hands
of
an
unskilled
abortionist.
therefore,
we
feel
that
the
statute
must
be
viewed
in
the
health
context.
1,579
women
received
abortions
in
georgia
in
1971
and
3,410
georgia
women
went
to
new
york
for
abortions.
we
do
not
have
any
statistics
available
for
the
district
of
columbia,
california,
and
other
more
liberal
states.
i
give
you
these
statistics
to
show
that
there
is
still
a
considerable
limitation
on
the
availability
of
abortion
services
in
georgia.
i
think
the
reasons
that
these
limitations
are
there
are
apparent
from
the
face
of
the
statute
as
it
remains.
the
procedures
are
the
three
doctors,
two
consultants,
and
a
hospital
abortion
committee
of
three
doctors,
is
on
its
face
a
very
time
consuming
procedure
not
only
for
the
woman,
but
for
the
doctors.
of
course,
time
is
a
very
important
factor
in
the
decision
to
terminate
a
pregnancy
for
two
reasons.
the
risk
to
a
woman’s
life
does
increase
as
time
goes
on.
first
trimester
abortions
are
safer
than
a
lot
of
late
abortions.
complications
are
three
to
four
times
higher
in
the
second
trimester.
in
a
study
that
was
conducted
at
the
public
hospital
in
atlanta
which
is
cited
in
our
original
brief
at
page
36,
doctors
baker
and
freeman
showed
that
54%
of
the
applicants
for
abortion
were
forced
to
discontinue
their
application
all
together,
so
their
alternatives
were
to
go
to
new
york
if
they
had
money
and
they
wouldn’t
have
been
applying
to
the
public
hospital
in
the
first
place
because
they
would’ve
been
ineligible
for
the
treatment
there,
or
to
resort
to
a
$50-illegal
abortion
in
atlanta,
or
of
course
$500-illegal
abortion
in
atlanta
would’ve
been
available
to
them,
or
to
place
the
child
for
adoption
or
rear
the
child.
that
study
further
showed
that
by
the
end
of
the
work
up
period
of
all
the
paper
work
that
56%
of
those
applicants
of
that
hospital
had
become
second
trimester
pregnancy.
that
is,
later
procedure,
the
saline
procedure.
not
only
is
this
a
time
consuming
procedure,
it
is
costly
to
the
patient.
we
now
can--
abortions
in
georgia,
atlanta
costs
from
$400
to
$600.
that
is
a
hospital
abortion
under
all
of
the
procedures
of
the
statute.
you
can
pay
airplane
fair
and
go
to
new
york
for
an
abortion
for
about
$225.
so,
it’s
no
wonder
that
so
many
women
choose
the
alternative
of
going
away
from
home
for
abortion
services.
they
cannot
afford
the
three
consultants
and
to
check
into
a
hospital
in
georgia.
in
addition,
we
feel
that
the
procedures
are
not
fair
to
the
woman
or
the
doctor.
there
is
no
hearing
before
the
abortion
committee.
there
is
no
right
for
the
woman
to
be
heard
at
any
event.
some
abortion
committees
do
permit
doctors
to
come.
some
of
them
transact
their
hospital
abortion
committee
business
by
telephone,
some
by
review
of
charts
only.
there
is
no
right
on
behalf
of
the
woman
to
know
the
reason
why
she’s
turned
down
and
there’s
no
right
to
have
a
review
of
the
decision
and
the
committee
procedure,
we
contend,
is
in
it
of
itself
an
invasion
of
the
patient’s
privacy.
not
only
must
she
reveal
to
her
doctor
the
private
information
or
the
private
reasons
for
which
she
wants
an
abortion,
but
they
are
then--
this
information,
she
has
to
give
it
to
two
other
consultants.
the
hospital
abortion
committee
becomes
a
permanent
part
of
the
records
that
stay.
so,
we
feel
that
the
whole
committee
procedure
is
devoid
of
fairness
and
due
process.
it
also
raises
a
substantial
conflict
of
interest
problem.
this
is
primarily
because
of
the
doctor.
the
limitation
of
abortions
to
accredited
hospitals
is
also
limiting
the
availability
of
this
service
to
georgia
women.
the
joint
commission
on
hospital
accreditation
privilege--
requirement
rather,
i
believe,
is
contained
in
only
4
of
the
13
ali
type
statutes,
and
this
is
not
included
as
a
recommendation
in
the
uniform
abortion
act
which
was
last
february,
approved
by
the
american
bar
association.
in
the
recent
case,
kansas
and
maryland
both
recognized
that
this
place
has
a
substantial
limitation
on
the
availability
of
facilities.
even
in
maryland
where
only
two
hospitals
were
not
accredited,
the
court
recognized
that,
and
in
georgia
we
have
some
150--
at
about
159
counties,
only
54
have
accredited
hospitals.
we
say
that
the
georgia
statute--
in
this
georgia
statute,
it
is
said
that
the
jcah
is
to
establish
standards
for
the
hospital
abortion
committee.
we
have
argued
that
this
is
an
unlawful
delegation
of
legislative
authority.
they--
in
fact,
jcah
just
does
not
operate
in
this
manner
or
in
this
area,
and
it
is
recognized
principle
of
law
in
georgia
that
delegation
of
legislative
authority
to
private
individuals
or
private
organizations
is
an
imperfect
delegation.
also,
we
would
point
out
that
the
limitation
to
accredited
hospitals
is
shown
to
be
unwarranted
by
the
new
york
experience.
there
was
an
article
in
sunday’s
new
york
times
which
reported
the
substantial
number
of
abortions
in
new
york,
but
most
significantly
found
that
there
were
only
4.6
tests
per
100,000
live
births
the
first
year
and
3.5
the
second
year
so
that
the
new
york
clinical
experience
is
proved
to
be
successful.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
your
honor,
i
think
that
this
study
is
a
published
document.
it
is
a
very
recent
published
document,
but
it
is
something
that
does
receive
wide
circulation
as
a
public
health
department
report.
i
do
not
have
a
copy
of
it
because
it
is
such
a
recent
report,
but
there
are
similar
reports
by
the
us
public
health
department.
we
have
recently
furnished
reports
to
the
court’s
library
and
would
be
happy
to
do
so
on
the
statistical
information.
i
do--
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
i
think
that
it
is
important
that
legislatures
not
encumber
a
fundamental
constitutional
right
with
so
many
procedures
as
to
effectively
manipulate
it
out
of
existence
and
this
is
our
argument
about
the
jcah
requirement
that,
to
limit
abortions
to
accredited
hospitals
in
many
instances
deprives
women
of
their
fundamental
right
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
have
a
child,
and
i
think
that
that
is
not
properly
a
legislative
judgment.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
well,
i
would
also--
instead
of
the
new
york
times
which
i
recognize
is
not
a
very
widely
accepted
source
for
judicial
notice,
however,
a
highly
recognized
newspaper.
i
would
cite
a
study
by
dr.
christopher
tutsi
who
is
the
recognized
medical
authority
in
the
area
of
statistics
in
which
he
finds
that
complications
are
lower--
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
well--
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
“a,”
excuse
me.
he
finds
that
complications
are
lower
in
clinics
than
in
hospitals
and
were
lower
for
hospital
out-patients
than
for
in-patients,
and
that
study
is
found--
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
he
took
that
into
consideration
in
arriving
at
his
statistics,
and
i’m
sorry,
i
should’ve
pointed
that
out.
complications
for
abortion
by
the
suction
curettage
method
excluding
preexisting
complications—cases,
this
is
strictly
the
normal
abortion
situation,
the
normal
patient.
we
also
say
that
the
procedure
imposed
on
the
abortion
service
is
not
imposed
on
other
medical
service
and
i
believe
that
point
has
been
previously
made
from
the
bench.
we
feel
that
the
state
would
have
an
interest
in
regulating
the
quality
of
health
service
just--
in
this
area
just
as
they
would
in
other
areas.
it’s
a
question
of
how
much,
and
i
think
it
could
be
adequately
regulated
to
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
health
department
as
on
the
licensing
requirements
for
hospitals.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
your
honor,
if
the
time
that
this
lawsuit
was
brought
i
would
probably
said
that
i
would
limit
abortion
services
to
being
performed
by
licensed
physicians.
however,
the
medical
technology
and
knowhow
in
this
area
is
developing
very
fast.
medical
students,
of
course,
are
doing
abortions
or--
and
i
think
that
midwives
are
going
to
be
learning
to
do
abortions
so
that
by
the
time
i
say
it,
it
may
be
out
of
date.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
probably
not.
i
feel
at
this
time
i
would
probably
not
be
unconstitutional
but,
in
the
future,
it
may
be
outdated
and
outlive
its
constitutionality
as
some
other
statutes.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
yes,
sir.
i
think
that’s
possible.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
in
a
joint
commission?
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
i
think
that
that
depends
on
each
state’s
particular
situation
and
it
depends
on
whether
your
licensing
requirements
are
so
strict
that
that
would,
in
turn,
effectively
manipulate
out
of
existence
the
same
fundamental
right
we’re
talking
about.
in
georgia,
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
minimum
requirement
for
a
licensed
hospital
is
two
beds
so
that
you
can
run
all
the
way
from
a
very
large
hospital
and
require
lots
of
facilities
to
the
two-bed
situation.
i
think
that
abortions
should
be
performed
in
specialized
facilities
regulated
by
the
state.
those
that
are
designed
for
abortion
purposes
and,
of
course,
in
the
regulation
you
could
require
that
they’d
be
close
to
hospitals
for
backup
services,
but
i
think
clinics
are
fully
capable
by
virtue
of
the
new
york
experience
statistics
that
i
was
citing
to
perform
effective
and
safe
abortion
services.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
i’m
saying
that
may
be
one
of
the
things
that
the
body
who
draws
the
rules
and
regulations
may
want
to
require.
i
believe
that
is
true
in
new
york
city.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
i
think
you’d
have
to
look
at
each
fact.
the
situation
in
new
york
city
probably
would
not.
some
of
the
more
rural
areas,
it
may
be
that
you
could
have
a
safe
abortion
facility
without
being
close
to
an
emergency
center.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
that’s
correct.
i
would
point
out
that
under--
if
your--
if
you
put
the
abortion
facilities
under
the
licensure
requirements
of
the
state,
then
the
citizens
have
the
protection
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
in
drawing
out
the
rules
and
regulations.
this
is
quite
different
from
turning
over
rules
and
regulations
to
jcha
which
is
a
private
organization
in
chicago
over
which
citizens
of
georgia
have
no
control.
i
would
like
to
speak
for
just
a
moment
about
the
doctor’s
interest
because
this
action
was
brought
on
behalf
of
a
group
of
doctors
and
we
have
asserted
their
rights
in
this
court.
we
assert
the
physician’s
right
to
practice
their
professions,
and
we
say
that
these
procedure
requirements
interfere
with
the
best
professional
judgment
or
interfere
with
their
practicing
of
their
profession
in
accordance
with
their
best
professional
judgment.
it
puts
them--
it
puts
the
doctor,
the
whole
area
of
having
abortion
in
the
criminal
area,
it
puts
the
doctor
in
a
position
of
always
having
to
weigh
his
interest
against
the
wife’s
interest--
the
woman’s
interest.
if
he
thinks
it’s
doubtful,
he’s
not
going
to
do
it.
he’s
going
to
resolve
the
question
in
his
own
favor
so
that
he
won’t
go
to
jail.
if
he--
and
i
think
this
is
a
conflict
of
interest
situation
that
we
should
not
put
the
doctor
in.
in
the
medical
association
of
georgia
in
its
last
legislative
effort
was
for
leaving
the
entire
area
of
abortion
unregulated
by
the
legislature,
but
leading
it
as
a
medical
practice
matter
and
so
that
the
illegal
abortionist
would
be
guilty
of
practicing
medicine
without
a
license
which
is
a
misdemeanor
in
georgia,
but
it
would
take
the
whole
area
of
abortion
out
from
under
the
criminal
statute.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
i
think
we
lawyers
dislike
having
our
profession
regulated
and
i
would
dislike
being
told
that
i
had
to
do
so
many
antitrust
cases
or
divorce
cases
per
month.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
well,
i
think
that
the
regulation
here
is
too
much.
it
comes
down
to
a
matter
of
degree,
i
think.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
well,
it
indicates
only
the
attitude
of
the
medical
profession
in
georgia
and
there--
i
think
that
is
important.
as
you
say,
everybody
would
like
to
be
out
from
under
regulation.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
well,
this
is
the
only
instance
that
i
know
of
where
doctors
submit
their
medical
judgment
to
a
committee
of
three
and
that
committee
of
three
has
the
right
to
override
the
practicing
physician’s
judgment,
and
i
think
this
is
the
type
of
regulation
or
the
degree
that
i
object
to.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
yes,
but
that
doesn’t
make
him
a
criminal
if
he
doesn’t
follow
them.
they
then
can
revoke
his
staff
privileges.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
well,
it
is
possible,
but
i
think
that
what
i
would
say
is
to
leave
it
up
to
the
professional
standards,
and
if
a
hospital
chooses
to
have
a
committee,
they
might
want
to
run
their
business
that
way
but
let’s
not
make
it
mandatory
for
the
woman
to
exercise
her
right
to
have
to
submit
her
case
to
a
hospital
committee.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
to
my
recollection,
it
does
have
a
time
limitation
on
it.
is
that
correct?
i
think
that
it’s
my
recollection
that
there
are
no
consultants
required,
no
committee,
no
limitation,
no
facility,
but
a
20-week
limitation
with
some
exceptions
as
i
recall.
i
would
think
it’s
constitutional.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
i’m
not
prepared
to
say
20
weeks,
but
i
am
prepared
to
say
that
the
reason
for
enacting
abortion
laws
in
the
very
beginning
was
to
protect
the
health
of
the
woman.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
and
that
reason
may
come
back
into
existence
at
some
period
during
the
pregnancy.
so
that,
it
could
be--
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that’s
possible.
that’s
not
involved
in
the
georgia
case.
there’s
no
time
limitation
in
our
statute
at
all.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
i
would
like
to
reserve
some
time.
thank
you.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
okay.
i
wanted
to
mention
some
of
the
things
that
came
up
in
the
argument.
the
hippocratic
oath,
i
believe,
was
mentioned.
i
have
had
some--
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
i
do
not
consider
it
medically
relevant
and
i
understand
that
medical
schools
are
not
now
using
it
and
that
the
oath
also
forbids
the
treatment
of
kidney
stones,
and
so
that
is
an
example
of
its
relevance
to
today.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
i--
based
on
personal
experience
with
the
me
medical
schools
in
lectures
on
ethics
and
abortion--
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
i
don’t
doubt
that
some
might
still
be
using
it,
but
i
think
it
was
an
oath
that
was
of
its
time
and
that
the
prohibition
against
treatment
for
kidney
stones
indicates
that
also.
it--
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
i
believe
the
brief
filed
on
behalf
of
the
obgyn
doctors
does
go
into
it.
i’m
not
sure
it’s
a
very
extensive
brief,
but
i
think
that
your
comments
indicate
the
lack
of
relevance
to
it
today
too
because
the
treatment
for
abortion
is
quite
different
today
than
when
it
was
when
it
was
written.
now,
it’s
about
a
15-minute
procedure
with
the
suction
device,
so
that
the
treatment
is--
if
you
say
that
the
treatment
for
kidney
stone
is
different
today,
then
i
would
answer
that
the
treatment
for
abortion
is
also
different
today.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
that
is
not
a
very
safe
procedure
then
either.
further,
to
just
kind
of
summarize
some
of
the
other
things
that
have
come
up,
the
state
in
its
supplemental
authorities
did
refer
to
this
legislative
study
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
some
information
in
there
and
in
that--
i
think
that
study
shows
that
it’s
the
interest
of
the
woman
and
not
the
fetus
involved,
and
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
information
in
there
that’s
not
contained
anywhere
else
and
that
is
that
there
were
about
60
or
70
abortions
performed
in
georgia
during
the
measles,
german
measles
academic
of
‘64
and
’65
and
that
did
place
a
lot
of
doctors
in
jeopardy,
and
i
think
that
there
are
now
compelling
reasons,
be
they
socio
or
economic
reasons,
just
as
valid
for
performing
abortions.
thank
you
very
much.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
decision
of
the
northern
district
of
georgia
and
also
a
three-judge
court
which
declared
portions
of
the
georgia
abortion
statute
unconstitutional
that
upheld
certain
procedural
requirement
and
refused
in
issuing
injunction
in
support
of
the
declaratory
judgment.
the
parties
here
included
mary
doe,
a
pregnant
woman,
a
married
pregnant
woman,
doctors,
nurses,
ministers,
social
workers
and
family
planning
and
abortion
council
organization.
they
found
this
action
as
a
class
action
seeking
to
represent
members
of
their
various
classes.
the
district
court
below
found
that
the
right
of
privacy
included
the
right
to
terminate
an
unwanted
pregnancy
and
that
the
statute
which
limited
the
reasons
therefore
was
unduly
unrestricted
and
overly
broad.
the
district
court
found
that
mary
doe
and
her
class
was
entitled
to
declaratory
relief.
the
physicians
even
though
they
were
found
to
have
standing
and
other
parties
were
said
to
have
insufficient
collision
of
interest.
this
question
was
brought
to
this
court
also.
this
case
stands
on
jurisdictional
grounds
similar
to
the
roe
versus
wade
case
which
has
just
been
argued
except
that
no
plaintiff
in
this
case
had
pending
from
the
prosecutions
outstanding
against
them.
it
is
our
position
that
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
is
much
like
the
case
in
wisconsin
versus
constantineau
where
that
case
–-the
statute
in
that
case
outrighted
against
the
third
parties
rights.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
yes,
your
honor
they
are.
the
statute
in
wisconsin
versus
constantineau
outright
against
the
third
parties
rights
and
sure
you
would
recall
that
with
the
posting
of
the
alcoholic
case.
the
criminal
penalty
there
ran
against
the
bartender
who
sold
alcoholic
beverages
so
that
the
woman,
that
posted
party
would
never
have
an
opportunity
to
assert
her
right,
that
was
a
woman
in
the
case,
in
the
defense
of
the
criminal
action
against
the
bartender.
here
we
have
a
like
situation
of
the
third
parties
rights.
mary
doe
who
would
never
have
an
opportunity,
we
say
adequately
to
assert
her
constitutional
rights
in
the
defense
of
the
doctor’s
criminal
prosecution.
georgia
like
texas,
it
is
not
a
crime
for
a
woman
to
submit
to
an
abortion
or
to
abort
herself.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
i
cannot
cite
you
a
case
expressed
but
it
is
my
recollection
that
the
georgia
courts
have
held
that
she
would
not
be
so
guilty.
her
husband
or
her
paramour
could
have
been
charged
but
to
my
recollection
is
not
going
to
charge
against
the
woman
as
a
conspirator.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
no,
your
honor,
it
was
not.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
the
hospital
was
not
thought
to
be
an
indispensable
party
since
the
hospital
abortion
committee
was
a
statutory
committee
created
by
the
statute
or
the
abortion
statute.
it
was
our
opinion
that
under
the
georgia
law
dealing
with
the
attorney
general
in
his
powers
which
gave
him
powers
over
our
board’s
committee
and
commissions
as
to
matters
of
law
that
this
was
sufficient
to
bring
that
interest
into
operation.
also,
the
abortion
committee
is
a
revolving
committee
and
it
would
involve
the
various
doctors
from
time
to
time.
most
hospitals
in
georgia
have
their
staff
members
sit
on
the
abortion
committee
so
that
it
changes
from
month
to
month
or
from
day
to
day
even.
so
that
it
was
felt
that
bringing
the
state
attorney
general
in
as
a
defendant
in
the
case
would
be
sufficient
to
raise
the
state
statutory
abortion
committee
in
the
exercise
of
a
statutory
authority
given
to
them.
mary
doe
was
a
22-year-old
woman.
she
was
married
and
pregnant
at
the
time
that
this
action
was
filed.
her
reasons
for
abortion
were
several.
she
had
three
previous
children.
two
of
whom
had
been
taken
from
her
custody
by
state
authorities
because
of
her
inability
to
care
for
them.
and
the
third
she
had
placed
with
adopted
parents
at
birth.
she
applied
to
the
public
hospital
for
an
abortion
which
she
was
eligible
for
free
medical
care.
her
application
there
was
denied.
she
later
planned
through
her
private
physician
to
a
private
hospital
abortion
committee
where
her
abortion
application
was
approved.
she
did
not
obtain
the
abortion,
however
because
she
did
not
have
the
cash
to
deposit
entire
hospital
bill
in
advance.
the
georgia
statute
is
--
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
yes,
your
honor
there
is
and
found
in
the
original
file
which
has
been
sent
up
to
this
court.
this
is
sealed
affidavit
which
is
signed
in
mary
doe’s
real
name.
it
was
signed
and
filed
with
the
court
originally
in
the
proceeding.
she
was
present
at
the
hearing
of
this
case
and
we
offered
to
have
her
testify
and
disclose
her
identity
and
the
court
did
not
deem
that
necessary.
we
found
that
in
the
fictitious
name
to
protect
her
then
not
to
be
involved
in
embarrassment
but
that
originally,
in
fact
they
do
not
follow
in
this
court.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
it
was
not
with
her
consent
your
honor.
as
i
recall,
that
was
for
the
protection
of
her
children.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
yes,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
chief
justice.
our
major
contingent
here
or
appeal
here
is
directed
primarily
at
the
procedural
requirements
less
standing
by
the
district
court
below.
our
statute
does
provide
that
right
as
a
ground
for
abortions.
also,
a
fetal
malformation
endangered
to
the
life
of
the
woman
or
serious
and
permanent
danger
to
her
health.
these
were
the
reasons
that
the
court
declared
unconstitutional
however,
there
were
other
good
reasons
–-
good
and
sufficient
reasons
for
an
abortion.
the
requirement
said
unless
standing
are
the
residency
requirement
that
the
woman’s
doctor
have
at
least
two
consultants
who
concur
on
his
opinion
and
approval
by
hospital
abortion
committee
of
at
least
three
more
doctors
and
the
accredited
licensed
hospital
provision.
this
accreditation
requirement
is
by
the
joint
commission
on
hospital
accreditation
of
chicago,
illinois
corporation
which
is
a
private
organization.
there
are
other
many
reporting
requirements
and
miscellaneous
provisions
left
in
the
statute
but
i
wish
to
direct
the
court’s
attention
to
the
hospital
abortion
committee,
the
accreditation
and
residency
requirement.
it
is
the
appellant’s
contention
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
debate
to
fetal
life
problem
in
this
case
because
if
the
district
court
below
recognized,
this
statute
is
aimed
at
protecting
the
health
of
women.
judge
smith
in
delivering
the
opinion
of
the
court
found
that
the
whole
thrust
of
the
present
georgia
statute
is
to
treat
the
problem
as
a
medical
one.
the
only
compelling
state
interest
however
that
has
been
asserted
by
the
state,
is
the
interest
in
preserving
fetal
life
and
then
taking
this
approach
to
the
statute,
the
state
finds
itself
in
a
very
inconsistent
position
we
feel,
that
is
affirming
that
fetuses
from
the
moment
of
conception
have
the
right
to
develop
and
be
born
and
yet
having
abandoned
such
right
as
to
those
fetuses
the
product
of
rape
or
which
may
like
to
be
malformed
or
those
which
may
endanger
the
life
or
health
of
the
woman.
further
the
state
is
in
the
inconsistent
position
of
financing
a
family
planning
program
which
daily
distributes
--.
excuse
me.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
that
is
correct.
right
both
forceful
and
statutory
which
is
girls
13
years
and
younger
in
georgia.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
yes,
that
is
one
of
the
exceptions.
i
will
always
model
after
the
model
penal
code
of
american
law
institute
version.
the
further
inconsistency
involves
the
financing
of
the
family
planning
program
which
distributes
further
department
of
public
health,
the
intrauterine
contraceptive
device
which
substantial
medical
opinion
has
destroyed
the
product
of
conception
or
prevent
implantation
of
the
fertilize
egg
or
embryo.
we
feel
that
if
the
state
has
such
an
unfettered
interest
in
fetal
life,
that
these
are
very
inconsistent
provisions.
thus
it
is
our
contention
that
the
statute
must
be
viewed
as
a
health
of
the
woman
directive
purpose
statute.
i
would
point
out
that
abortion
is
not
a
new
medical
procedure.
of
course
we
have
heard
a
lot
about
it
in
the
last
few
years.
but
it
is
one
that
has
been
extensively
performed
throughout
the
history
of
our
country
and
of
course
illegally.
because
of
the
abortion
statutes,
the
great
majority
of
abortion
had
been
performed
by
unskilled
person,
those
at
least
equipped
to
take
care
of
the
health
problems.
doctors,
because
it
is
a
crime,
have
not
been
performing
abortion.
abortion
statutes
however,
had
not
stopped
the
abortions.
they
have
not
served
their
purpose
or
they
are
not
reaching
the
purpose
of
protecting
fetal
life.
the
fact
is
a
valid
purpose.
to
ascend
that
these
statutes
do
protect
fetal
life
is
to
ignore
the
actual
fact.
in
our
brief
and
in
the
many
amici
brief
filed
in
this
case,
there
is
extensive
citation
to
statistics
about
illegal
abortion
and
the
admission
of
patient
or
septic
abortions
that
is
the
incomplete
abortion
in
the
hospital
which
show
that
illegal
abortions
are
being
performed.
what
we
are
actually
talking
about
is
getting
abortion
out
of
the
illegal
arena
into
the
health
service
arena.
and
this
is
the
purpose
of
this
litigation.
i
would
point
out
that
illegal
abortion
and
the
complications
there
from
is
the
largest
single
cause
of
maternal
mortality
in
the
united
states.
therefore
abortion
statute
have
resulted
and
one
of
our
notions,
largest
health
problems.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
procedural
requirements
less
standing
by
the
court
below
had
virtually
manipulated
out
of
existence
the
right
to
terminate
an
unwanted
pregnancy
as
recognized
by
the
court.
the
decision
below
characterizes
the
decision
to
terminate
an
unwanted
pregnancy
as
a
personal-medical
decision.
in
commenting
about
the
procedural
requirement,
the
hospital
abortion
committee,
the
limitation
to
the
accredited
hospital,
the
court
said
that
the
state
has
an
interest
in
the
quality
of
healthcare
to
be
administered
to
its
citizen.
but
this
is
not
to
imply
that
the
present
procedures
are
the
best
means
of
control.
the
present
seems
to
be
unnecessarily
cumbersome
and
possibly
a
due
process
hazard.
this
was
the
observation
on
the
court
in
a
footnote
and
it
is
our
contention
that
these
procedures
are
so
cumbersome,
counseling
and
time
consuming
as
to
the
date,
mary
doe
and
members
of
her
class
and
doctors
and
members
of
their
class
of
various
rights.
of
course
there
is
an
inherent
time
factor
in
pregnancy
and
this
must
be
a
factor
considered.
first
trimester,
abortions
are
safer
than
late
abortions.
therefore
it
is
imperative
that
the
right
to
terminate
an
unwanted
pregnancy
be
efficiently
exercised.
mortality
and
complications
for
late
abortions
are
three
times
greater
after
12
weeks.
and
it
is
only
about
the
sixth
or
the
eighth
week
that
pregnancy
test
actually
become
accurate
or
the
degree
of
accuracy
is
such
that
to
predict
whether
one
is
pregnant
or
not.
so
that
we
actually
have
about
12
weeks
--
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
does
the
record?
i
am
sorry.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
no,
your
honor.
we
were
not
permitted
to
introduce
our
evidence
at
the
hearing
that
was
--
we
have
many
witnesses
to
testify
that
various
aspect
of
abortion
and
pregnancy.
i
am
sure
that
this
court
can
take
judicial
notice
on
many
medical
intricacies
which
would
disclose
that
this
is
fact.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
yes,
it
is.
from
my
recollection,
from
my
understanding
that
this
is
accepted
procedure
that
a
pregnancy
is
not
easily
detectable
until
after
the
sixth
week
and
accuracy
is
about
the
eighth
week.
the
requirement
that
a
physician
have
two
consultants
and
then
presents
the
case
to
the
abortion
committee.
it
is
un-civic,
an
unsuited
procedure
for
medical
treatment.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
there
are
many
committees
in
hospitals
or
that
have
committees
and
they
have
other
kinds
of
committees
but
these
do
not
make
decisions
about
constitutional
right
on
whether
or
not,
it
would
be
exercised
and
in
the
hospital
abortion
committee
being
a
statutory
committee
is
beyond
of
the
state
government,
we
can
contend
and
would
be
different
from
an
administration
committee
from
which
it
is
--
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
accreditation
standards
of
the
joint
commission
do
not
require
appointment
of
abortion
or
other
committees.
this
is
a
practice
that
has
developed
and
grown
up
and
i
think
it
grew
up
prior
to
the
american
law
institute
specifically
as
to
abortion
and
it
was
to
relieve
doctors
from
the
responsibility
of
making
this
decisions
solely
and
they
were
afraid
of
assuming
that
responsibility
because
of
the
criminal
sanctions
imposed
by
law.
therefore
they
have
their
hospitals
constitute
abortion
committee.
they
would
have
to
share
the
responsibility
for
such
a
decision.
the
operations
of
committees
or
the
hospitals,
of
course,
would
be
an
internal
matter
for
hospital
and
it
might
be
possible
that
a
committee,
that
a
hospital
could
continue
to
have
a
committee
to
govern
abortions
in
that
hospital.
however,
it
is
our
contention
that
the
right
to
terminate
a
pregnancy
should
not
be
controlled
by
statutory
committee
from
which
there
is
no
appeal,
where
there
is
no
opportunity
for
a
hearing,
the
woman
is
never
seen
by
the
members
of
the
committee.
she
is
never
told
where
her
abortion
was
denied.
and
her
doctor
at
many
times
is
not
even
permitted
to
come
and
present
her
case.
if
this
committee,we
feel
is
not
a
vehicle
which
could
properly,
determine
this
constitutional
right.
we
feel
that
it
is
as
the
court
said
below
in
medical-personal
decision
that
many
factors
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
have
an
abortion
are
personal
like
your
desire
to
have
only
two
children
on
the
family
size.
your
economic
status
is
a
matter
of
personal
knowledge.
this
is
not
a
matter
that
can
be
effectively
presented
to
a
committee.
a
doctor
could
not
possibly
present
all
these
matters
to
a
hospital
abortion
committee.
we
feel
that
this
committee
is
just
an
improper
vehicle
for
determining
the
right
to
terminate
an
unwanted
pregnancy.
additionally,
there
is
a
problem
of
the
doctor
and
he
feels
that
his
patient
should
have
an
abortion.
she
wants
an
abortion
but
he
must
submit
his
decision
not
only
to
concurrence
of
two
more
consultants
but
to
the
hospital
abortion
committee.
these
are
his
competitors,
his
professional
competitors.
there
are
doctors
in
his
community
who
decide
what
he
will
do
in
his
medical
practice.
it
is
the
position
of
the
doctors
that
this
infringes
their
right
to
practice
medicine
in
accordance
with
their
best
medical
judgment.
it
permits
the
committee
to
substitute
their
judgment,
their
religious
or
personal
views
for
those,
of
his
and
the
decision
rates
between
himself
and
his
patient.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
that
is
true
but
then
could
he
have
some
voice
in
arriving
at
the
standards
of
his
profession
and
that
the
application
of
his
professional
standards
would
not
be
designed
as
application
of
the
abortion
committees
on
personal
views.
i
think
that
these
are
matters
that
are
better
left
to
the
profession.
i
would
think
that
the
medical
profession
can
develop
its
standards,
the
american
college
of
obstetricians
and
gynecologists
has
taken
a
policy
that
when
an
abortion
is
requested
by
a
woman
and
there
are
no
contra-medical
indications
then
the
abortion
would
be
performed
without
even
the
necessity
of
the
consultant,
where
it
is
recommended
by
the
doctor
then
the
american
college
recommends
that
the
doctor
have
a
consultant
on
that
decision.
i
think
that
the
profession
can
develop
standards
and
that
this
is
where
it
should
be
controlled
rather
than
by
hospital
abortion
committee
sitting
in
a
quasi-judicial
situation.
i
would
point
out
that
the
hospital
(inaudible)
georgia
requirement
limits
abortions
in
georgia
and
then
as
many
women
access
to
abortion
services,
105
of
georgia’s
candidates
have
no
accredited
hospital.
so
that
those
women
who
are
dependent
upon
their
county
hospital
for
free
medical
service
are
denied
by
virtue
of
this
hospital
accreditation
requirement.
there
--
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
there
are
284
hospitals
and
i
have
not
made
the
comparison
to
see.
only
abortions
that
only
been
found
in
22
counties
in
georgia.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
yes,
it
is
possible
your
honor
that
some
8
or
10
or
the
smaller,
less
populated
hospital
counties
could
have
that.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
down
the
lane
we
do.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
one
further
thing
as
to
hospitals.
the
new
york
experience
has
shown
that
abortion
in
clinics
is
a
relatively
safe
--
is
a
safe
procedure.
early
abortions
are
not
required
to
be
performed
in
hospitals.
and
if
we
have
this
requirement
or
did
not
have
the
limitation
to
accredit
the
hospitals
in
georgia
then
we
can
have
abortion
clinics
in
the
more
rural
areas.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
it
was
adopted
in
1968,
april
of
1968.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
that
is
correct.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
yes.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
that
is
correct
or
other
application
of
the
law
meaning
by
abortion
committees
of
hospitals.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
that
is
correct.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
as
to
the
nurses,
we
would
say
that
they
still
have
a
controversy
or
a
need
for
relief
because
they
too
are
not
permitted
to
practice
their
professions.
of
course,
they
would
not
be
independently
performing
abortion
but
would
be
assisting
doctors
so
that
there
is.
as
to
the
ministers
and
other
counselors
and
social
workers
who
wish
to
counsel
abortion
based
under
the
decision
below
which
said
that
abortion
are
obtainable
for
any
reason.
they
would
not
now
fear
the
prosecution
under
the
conspiracy
statute,
the
aiding
and
abetting
statute
for
counseling
abortion.
there
is
no
really
real
relief
needed
here.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
on
behalf
of
the
nurses,
yes,
your
honor
and
as
to
the
counselors,
it
is
our
contention
that
they
had
a
sufficient
collision
of
interest
for
the
declaratory
relief
that
have
been
granted
as
to
them.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
we
occupy
a
position
similar
to
texas
as
to
declaratory
relief.
we
have
a
statute
in
georgia
which
says
that
equity
will
not
interfere
in
the
administration
of
criminal
laws.
yes,
criminal
laws.
this
has
recently
been
construed
in
1968
to
prohibit
a
declaratory
judgment
and
equitable
relief
as
to
a
criminal
statute.
so
that
there
is
no
alternative
to
go
into
state
court
for
declaratory
relief
and
this
is
the
only
forum
in
which
we
contend
that
plaintiffs
to
assert
their
right.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
yes,
we
are
making
a
constitutional
argument
for
everyone
in
the
--
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
with
respect
to
including
the
first
amendment
argument
which
was
made
below
as
to
counseling
abortion.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
thank
you.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
no
mr.
justice,
there
has
been
no
manifestation.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
yes,
i
think
the
need
for
injunctive
relief
arises
from
the
fact
that
out
of
the
24
appellate
decisions
on
abortion
in
georgia,
13
of
those
have
involved
doctors
so
that
there
--
we
have
a
history
of
prosecution
of
doctors
in
georgia.
additionally,
the
law
has
continued
to
be
in
force
and
abortions
are
being
denied
for
unknown
reasons
by
the
hospital
abortion
committee
that
presents
a
very
real
need
for
injunctive
relief
at
--
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
we
do
not
know
why
they
are
denying
the
abortions
but
are
not
required
to
disclose
and
they
do
not
disclose.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
contractors.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
yes,
abortionists,
illegal
abortionist.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
yes,
non-physician.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
thank
you.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
just
a
few
things
mr.
chief
justice.
all
of
the
defendants
in
this
case
did
file
motion
to
dismiss
which
the
court
treated
as
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
the
judgment
of
the
court
specifies
that
in
page
87
of
the
appendix.
we
have
not
designated
constitutional
basis
for
our
case
but
i
would
like
to
say
that
we
contend
that
the
procedure
requirements
infringe
due
process
and
equal
protection
and
that
the
right
of
privacy
as
enunciated
in
griswold
of
course
is
their
basic
reliance.
i
would
commend
to
the
court
the
article
of
professor
miens(ph)
also
which
goes
into
the
abortion,
common-law
of
abortion
and
point
out
that
in
georgia,
abortion
before
quickening
was
only
a
misdemeanor
beginning
in
1876
and
prior
to
that
then,
it
was
not
crime
at
all.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
decision
in
the
northern
district
court
of
georgia
where
the
three-judge
court
below
held
portions
of
a
model
penal
code
type
abortion
statute
unconstitutional
and
upheld
other
provisions,
and
refused
to
issue
an
injunction
in
support
of
a
declaratory
judgment.
the
case
was
filed
on
behalf
of
mary
doe
a
pregnant
woman,
doctors,
nurses,
ministers,
social
workers,
and
family
planning
organizations
as
a
class
action
seeking
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief.
the
district
court
found
that
the
right
of
privacy
there
did
include
the
right
to
terminate
an
unwanted
pregnancy
without
hanging
the
case
on
any
particular
provision
in
the
constitution
that
rely
primarily
on
this
court’s
decision
in
griswold.
the
court
found
that
the
specification
of
three
reasons
for
abortion
in
our
statute
was
unduly
restrictive
and
overbroad.
mary
doe
was
given
a
declaratory
judgment.
however,
the
physicians
and
other
parties,
even
though
said
to
have
sufficient
standing,
lacked
sufficient
collision
of
interests
and,
therefore,
the
case
was
dismissed
as
to
them.
this
case
stands
on
similar
jurisdictional
grounds
as
the
roe
versus
white
case
which
we
just
heard.
i
would
only
point
to
two
cases
on
the
jurisdictional
point.
one
is
wisconsin
versus
constantineau
which
dealt
with
a
third
party’s
constitutional
right
there,
and
then
the
discussion
in
the
eisenstadt
versus
baird
case,
the
recent
case
of
this
court.
the
facts
of
this
case
involved
mary
doe
who
was
a
22-year-old
woman,
married.
she
had
given
birth
to
three
previous
children,
two
of
whom
had
been
taken
away
from
her
by
state
authorities
because
she
was
unable
to
care
for
them.
the
third
child,
she
was
required
by
her
husband
to
place
with
adoptive
parents.
mrs.
doe
requested
an
abortion
at
the
public
hospital
where
she
was
entitled
to
free
medical
service.
she
was
an
indigent
person,
by
the
way.
her--
mary
had
been
unstable,
and
during
the
pendency
of
her
pregnancy
her
husband
abandoned
her.
she
was
about
10
or
11
weeks
when
this
lawsuit
was
commenced,
and
she
subsequently
applied
to
private
physicians
in
atlanta
in
a
private
hospital
for
an
abortion
and
that
application
was
approved.
she
was
turned
down,
however,
by
the
public
hospital.
the
abortion
statute
in
georgia,
as
i
said,
is
modeled
after
the
model
penal
code
and
was
adopted
in
1968.
the
prior
law
was
adopted
in
1976
and
it
was
of
the
texas
type
to
save
the
life
of
the
woman
statute.
the
legislature
in
1968,
however,
permitted
abortion
for
three
reasons:
rape,
likelihood
of
grave
and
permanent
or
irremediable
fetal
malformation
and
danger
to
the
life
of
the
woman
or
serious
and
permanent
injury
to
her
health.
these
were
the
reasons
the
court
declared
unconstitutional.
they
left
standing,
however,
the
procedures
in
the
statute.
the
residency
requirement,
the
requirement
that
a
doctor
have
two
consultants,
the
hospital
abortion
committee
approval
requirement
of
at
least
three
more
doctors,
and
the
requirement
that
all
abortions
be
performed
in
accredited
licensed
hospitals,
that
is
those
accredited
by
the
joint
commission
on
hospital
accreditation,
and
there
were
several
other
reporting
requirements
that
were
left
standing.
appellants
here
contend
that
it’s
not
necessary
to
debate
the
fetal
life
problem
in
the
georgia
case
because,
as
the
district
court
recognized,
the
georgia
statute
is
aimed
at
protecting
the
health
of
the
woman.
judge
smith
said
that
the
whole
thrust
of
the
present
statute
is
to
treat
the
problem
as
a
medical
one.
the
only
compelling
interest
that
has
been
asserted
by
the
state,
however,
is
the
interest
in
preserving
fetal
life.
in
taking
this
position,
the
state
has
found
itself
in
a
very--
several
inconsistent
positions,
that
is
they
have
abandoned
the
fetuses
that
are
products
of
rape,
they
have
abandoned
those
that
might
likely
be
malformed,
and
they
have
abandoned
those
that
might
injure
the
life
or
the
health
of
the
woman,
so
that
if
the
state
claims
an
interest
in
fetal
life
there,
they
have
abandoned
some
and
are
protecting
others.
the
state
is
in
the
further
inconsistent
position
because,
under
its
public
health
code
and
family
planning
service
it
has--
as
a
medical
service,
inserted
several
thousand
intrauterine
devices
which
substantial
medical
opinion
holds
either
destroys
the
product
of
conception
or
prevents
implantation
of
the
fertilized
egg
or
embryo.
the
brief
on
behalf
of
the
state
has
argued
that
the
right
to
life
begins
at
the
moment
of
conception,
and
we
report
this
out
as
another
inconsistency
in
their
argument.
abortion
is
not
a
new
medical
procedure
or
maybe
it’s
not
a
new
procedure,
i
should
say.
illegal
abortions
have
been
performed
for
many
years.
there
aren’t
any
statistics
that
are
very
reliable
on
this,
but
writers
in
the
area
estimate
several
thousand
per
year
in
the
united
states
and
several
thousand
deaths
have
occurred
from
illegal
abortions.
i
think
the
real
abortion
that
this
court
is
faced
with
is
whether
abortion
is
going
to
be
made
a
legal
health
service
for
women
or
whether
it’s
going
to
be
kept
in
the
illegal
rim
and
handled
by
the
unskilled
so-called
non-medical
practitioners.
i
believe
i’ve
pointed
out
before
in
the
prior
argument
that
we
have
had
some-23--
25
cases
now
reported
involving
abortions
in
georgia
and
many
of
those
involved
nurses
or
contractors
and,
i
believe,
a
plumber
in
one
case,
and
you
can
find
those
kinds
of
cases
all
over
the
united
states,
woman
placing
their
hands--
their
life
in
the
hands
of
an
unskilled
abortionist.
therefore,
we
feel
that
the
statute
must
be
viewed
in
the
health
context.
1,579
women
received
abortions
in
georgia
in
1971
and
3,410
georgia
women
went
to
new
york
for
abortions.
we
do
not
have
any
statistics
available
for
the
district
of
columbia,
california,
and
other
more
liberal
states.
i
give
you
these
statistics
to
show
that
there
is
still
a
considerable
limitation
on
the
availability
of
abortion
services
in
georgia.
i
think
the
reasons
that
these
limitations
are
there
are
apparent
from
the
face
of
the
statute
as
it
remains.
the
procedures
are
the
three
doctors,
two
consultants,
and
a
hospital
abortion
committee
of
three
doctors,
is
on
its
face
a
very
time
consuming
procedure
not
only
for
the
woman,
but
for
the
doctors.
of
course,
time
is
a
very
important
factor
in
the
decision
to
terminate
a
pregnancy
for
two
reasons.
the
risk
to
a
woman’s
life
does
increase
as
time
goes
on.
first
trimester
abortions
are
safer
than
a
lot
of
late
abortions.
complications
are
three
to
four
times
higher
in
the
second
trimester.
in
a
study
that
was
conducted
at
the
public
hospital
in
atlanta
which
is
cited
in
our
original
brief
at
page
36,
doctors
baker
and
freeman
showed
that
54%
of
the
applicants
for
abortion
were
forced
to
discontinue
their
application
all
together,
so
their
alternatives
were
to
go
to
new
york
if
they
had
money
and
they
wouldn’t
have
been
applying
to
the
public
hospital
in
the
first
place
because
they
would’ve
been
ineligible
for
the
treatment
there,
or
to
resort
to
a
$50-illegal
abortion
in
atlanta,
or
of
course
$500-illegal
abortion
in
atlanta
would’ve
been
available
to
them,
or
to
place
the
child
for
adoption
or
rear
the
child.
that
study
further
showed
that
by
the
end
of
the
work
up
period
of
all
the
paper
work
that
56%
of
those
applicants
of
that
hospital
had
become
second
trimester
pregnancy.
that
is,
later
procedure,
the
saline
procedure.
not
only
is
this
a
time
consuming
procedure,
it
is
costly
to
the
patient.
we
now
can--
abortions
in
georgia,
atlanta
costs
from
$400
to
$600.
that
is
a
hospital
abortion
under
all
of
the
procedures
of
the
statute.
you
can
pay
airplane
fair
and
go
to
new
york
for
an
abortion
for
about
$225.
so,
it’s
no
wonder
that
so
many
women
choose
the
alternative
of
going
away
from
home
for
abortion
services.
they
cannot
afford
the
three
consultants
and
to
check
into
a
hospital
in
georgia.
in
addition,
we
feel
that
the
procedures
are
not
fair
to
the
woman
or
the
doctor.
there
is
no
hearing
before
the
abortion
committee.
there
is
no
right
for
the
woman
to
be
heard
at
any
event.
some
abortion
committees
do
permit
doctors
to
come.
some
of
them
transact
their
hospital
abortion
committee
business
by
telephone,
some
by
review
of
charts
only.
there
is
no
right
on
behalf
of
the
woman
to
know
the
reason
why
she’s
turned
down
and
there’s
no
right
to
have
a
review
of
the
decision
and
the
committee
procedure,
we
contend,
is
in
it
of
itself
an
invasion
of
the
patient’s
privacy.
not
only
must
she
reveal
to
her
doctor
the
private
information
or
the
private
reasons
for
which
she
wants
an
abortion,
but
they
are
then--
this
information,
she
has
to
give
it
to
two
other
consultants.
the
hospital
abortion
committee
becomes
a
permanent
part
of
the
records
that
stay.
so,
we
feel
that
the
whole
committee
procedure
is
devoid
of
fairness
and
due
process.
it
also
raises
a
substantial
conflict
of
interest
problem.
this
is
primarily
because
of
the
doctor.
the
limitation
of
abortions
to
accredited
hospitals
is
also
limiting
the
availability
of
this
service
to
georgia
women.
the
joint
commission
on
hospital
accreditation
privilege--
requirement
rather,
i
believe,
is
contained
in
only
4
of
the
13
ali
type
statutes,
and
this
is
not
included
as
a
recommendation
in
the
uniform
abortion
act
which
was
last
february,
approved
by
the
american
bar
association.
in
the
recent
case,
kansas
and
maryland
both
recognized
that
this
place
has
a
substantial
limitation
on
the
availability
of
facilities.
even
in
maryland
where
only
two
hospitals
were
not
accredited,
the
court
recognized
that,
and
in
georgia
we
have
some
150--
at
about
159
counties,
only
54
have
accredited
hospitals.
we
say
that
the
georgia
statute--
in
this
georgia
statute,
it
is
said
that
the
jcah
is
to
establish
standards
for
the
hospital
abortion
committee.
we
have
argued
that
this
is
an
unlawful
delegation
of
legislative
authority.
they--
in
fact,
jcah
just
does
not
operate
in
this
manner
or
in
this
area,
and
it
is
recognized
principle
of
law
in
georgia
that
delegation
of
legislative
authority
to
private
individuals
or
private
organizations
is
an
imperfect
delegation.
also,
we
would
point
out
that
the
limitation
to
accredited
hospitals
is
shown
to
be
unwarranted
by
the
new
york
experience.
there
was
an
article
in
sunday’s
new
york
times
which
reported
the
substantial
number
of
abortions
in
new
york,
but
most
significantly
found
that
there
were
only
4.6
tests
per
100,000
live
births
the
first
year
and
3.5
the
second
year
so
that
the
new
york
clinical
experience
is
proved
to
be
successful.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
your
honor,
i
think
that
this
study
is
a
published
document.
it
is
a
very
recent
published
document,
but
it
is
something
that
does
receive
wide
circulation
as
a
public
health
department
report.
i
do
not
have
a
copy
of
it
because
it
is
such
a
recent
report,
but
there
are
similar
reports
by
the
us
public
health
department.
we
have
recently
furnished
reports
to
the
court’s
library
and
would
be
happy
to
do
so
on
the
statistical
information.
i
do--
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
i
think
that
it
is
important
that
legislatures
not
encumber
a
fundamental
constitutional
right
with
so
many
procedures
as
to
effectively
manipulate
it
out
of
existence
and
this
is
our
argument
about
the
jcah
requirement
that,
to
limit
abortions
to
accredited
hospitals
in
many
instances
deprives
women
of
their
fundamental
right
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
have
a
child,
and
i
think
that
that
is
not
properly
a
legislative
judgment.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
well,
i
would
also--
instead
of
the
new
york
times
which
i
recognize
is
not
a
very
widely
accepted
source
for
judicial
notice,
however,
a
highly
recognized
newspaper.
i
would
cite
a
study
by
dr.
christopher
tutsi
who
is
the
recognized
medical
authority
in
the
area
of
statistics
in
which
he
finds
that
complications
are
lower--
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
well--
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
“a,”
excuse
me.
he
finds
that
complications
are
lower
in
clinics
than
in
hospitals
and
were
lower
for
hospital
out-patients
than
for
in-patients,
and
that
study
is
found--
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
he
took
that
into
consideration
in
arriving
at
his
statistics,
and
i’m
sorry,
i
should’ve
pointed
that
out.
complications
for
abortion
by
the
suction
curettage
method
excluding
preexisting
complications—cases,
this
is
strictly
the
normal
abortion
situation,
the
normal
patient.
we
also
say
that
the
procedure
imposed
on
the
abortion
service
is
not
imposed
on
other
medical
service
and
i
believe
that
point
has
been
previously
made
from
the
bench.
we
feel
that
the
state
would
have
an
interest
in
regulating
the
quality
of
health
service
just--
in
this
area
just
as
they
would
in
other
areas.
it’s
a
question
of
how
much,
and
i
think
it
could
be
adequately
regulated
to
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
health
department
as
on
the
licensing
requirements
for
hospitals.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
your
honor,
if
the
time
that
this
lawsuit
was
brought
i
would
probably
said
that
i
would
limit
abortion
services
to
being
performed
by
licensed
physicians.
however,
the
medical
technology
and
knowhow
in
this
area
is
developing
very
fast.
medical
students,
of
course,
are
doing
abortions
or--
and
i
think
that
midwives
are
going
to
be
learning
to
do
abortions
so
that
by
the
time
i
say
it,
it
may
be
out
of
date.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
probably
not.
i
feel
at
this
time
i
would
probably
not
be
unconstitutional
but,
in
the
future,
it
may
be
outdated
and
outlive
its
constitutionality
as
some
other
statutes.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
yes,
sir.
i
think
that’s
possible.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
in
a
joint
commission?
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
i
think
that
that
depends
on
each
state’s
particular
situation
and
it
depends
on
whether
your
licensing
requirements
are
so
strict
that
that
would,
in
turn,
effectively
manipulate
out
of
existence
the
same
fundamental
right
we’re
talking
about.
in
georgia,
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
minimum
requirement
for
a
licensed
hospital
is
two
beds
so
that
you
can
run
all
the
way
from
a
very
large
hospital
and
require
lots
of
facilities
to
the
two-bed
situation.
i
think
that
abortions
should
be
performed
in
specialized
facilities
regulated
by
the
state.
those
that
are
designed
for
abortion
purposes
and,
of
course,
in
the
regulation
you
could
require
that
they’d
be
close
to
hospitals
for
backup
services,
but
i
think
clinics
are
fully
capable
by
virtue
of
the
new
york
experience
statistics
that
i
was
citing
to
perform
effective
and
safe
abortion
services.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
i’m
saying
that
may
be
one
of
the
things
that
the
body
who
draws
the
rules
and
regulations
may
want
to
require.
i
believe
that
is
true
in
new
york
city.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
i
think
you’d
have
to
look
at
each
fact.
the
situation
in
new
york
city
probably
would
not.
some
of
the
more
rural
areas,
it
may
be
that
you
could
have
a
safe
abortion
facility
without
being
close
to
an
emergency
center.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
that’s
correct.
i
would
point
out
that
under--
if
your--
if
you
put
the
abortion
facilities
under
the
licensure
requirements
of
the
state,
then
the
citizens
have
the
protection
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
in
drawing
out
the
rules
and
regulations.
this
is
quite
different
from
turning
over
rules
and
regulations
to
jcha
which
is
a
private
organization
in
chicago
over
which
citizens
of
georgia
have
no
control.
i
would
like
to
speak
for
just
a
moment
about
the
doctor’s
interest
because
this
action
was
brought
on
behalf
of
a
group
of
doctors
and
we
have
asserted
their
rights
in
this
court.
we
assert
the
physician’s
right
to
practice
their
professions,
and
we
say
that
these
procedure
requirements
interfere
with
the
best
professional
judgment
or
interfere
with
their
practicing
of
their
profession
in
accordance
with
their
best
professional
judgment.
it
puts
them--
it
puts
the
doctor,
the
whole
area
of
having
abortion
in
the
criminal
area,
it
puts
the
doctor
in
a
position
of
always
having
to
weigh
his
interest
against
the
wife’s
interest--
the
woman’s
interest.
if
he
thinks
it’s
doubtful,
he’s
not
going
to
do
it.
he’s
going
to
resolve
the
question
in
his
own
favor
so
that
he
won’t
go
to
jail.
if
he--
and
i
think
this
is
a
conflict
of
interest
situation
that
we
should
not
put
the
doctor
in.
in
the
medical
association
of
georgia
in
its
last
legislative
effort
was
for
leaving
the
entire
area
of
abortion
unregulated
by
the
legislature,
but
leading
it
as
a
medical
practice
matter
and
so
that
the
illegal
abortionist
would
be
guilty
of
practicing
medicine
without
a
license
which
is
a
misdemeanor
in
georgia,
but
it
would
take
the
whole
area
of
abortion
out
from
under
the
criminal
statute.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
i
think
we
lawyers
dislike
having
our
profession
regulated
and
i
would
dislike
being
told
that
i
had
to
do
so
many
antitrust
cases
or
divorce
cases
per
month.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
well,
i
think
that
the
regulation
here
is
too
much.
it
comes
down
to
a
matter
of
degree,
i
think.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
well,
it
indicates
only
the
attitude
of
the
medical
profession
in
georgia
and
there--
i
think
that
is
important.
as
you
say,
everybody
would
like
to
be
out
from
under
regulation.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
well,
this
is
the
only
instance
that
i
know
of
where
doctors
submit
their
medical
judgment
to
a
committee
of
three
and
that
committee
of
three
has
the
right
to
override
the
practicing
physician’s
judgment,
and
i
think
this
is
the
type
of
regulation
or
the
degree
that
i
object
to.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
yes,
but
that
doesn’t
make
him
a
criminal
if
he
doesn’t
follow
them.
they
then
can
revoke
his
staff
privileges.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
well,
it
is
possible,
but
i
think
that
what
i
would
say
is
to
leave
it
up
to
the
professional
standards,
and
if
a
hospital
chooses
to
have
a
committee,
they
might
want
to
run
their
business
that
way
but
let’s
not
make
it
mandatory
for
the
woman
to
exercise
her
right
to
have
to
submit
her
case
to
a
hospital
committee.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
to
my
recollection,
it
does
have
a
time
limitation
on
it.
is
that
correct?
i
think
that
it’s
my
recollection
that
there
are
no
consultants
required,
no
committee,
no
limitation,
no
facility,
but
a
20-week
limitation
with
some
exceptions
as
i
recall.
i
would
think
it’s
constitutional.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
i’m
not
prepared
to
say
20
weeks,
but
i
am
prepared
to
say
that
the
reason
for
enacting
abortion
laws
in
the
very
beginning
was
to
protect
the
health
of
the
woman.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
and
that
reason
may
come
back
into
existence
at
some
period
during
the
pregnancy.
so
that,
it
could
be--
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that’s
possible.
that’s
not
involved
in
the
georgia
case.
there’s
no
time
limitation
in
our
statute
at
all.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
i
would
like
to
reserve
some
time.
thank
you.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
okay.
i
wanted
to
mention
some
of
the
things
that
came
up
in
the
argument.
the
hippocratic
oath,
i
believe,
was
mentioned.
i
have
had
some--
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
i
do
not
consider
it
medically
relevant
and
i
understand
that
medical
schools
are
not
now
using
it
and
that
the
oath
also
forbids
the
treatment
of
kidney
stones,
and
so
that
is
an
example
of
its
relevance
to
today.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
i--
based
on
personal
experience
with
the
me
medical
schools
in
lectures
on
ethics
and
abortion--
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
i
don’t
doubt
that
some
might
still
be
using
it,
but
i
think
it
was
an
oath
that
was
of
its
time
and
that
the
prohibition
against
treatment
for
kidney
stones
indicates
that
also.
it--
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
i
believe
the
brief
filed
on
behalf
of
the
obgyn
doctors
does
go
into
it.
i’m
not
sure
it’s
a
very
extensive
brief,
but
i
think
that
your
comments
indicate
the
lack
of
relevance
to
it
today
too
because
the
treatment
for
abortion
is
quite
different
today
than
when
it
was
when
it
was
written.
now,
it’s
about
a
15-minute
procedure
with
the
suction
device,
so
that
the
treatment
is--
if
you
say
that
the
treatment
for
kidney
stone
is
different
today,
then
i
would
answer
that
the
treatment
for
abortion
is
also
different
today.
ms.
margie
pitts
hames
that
is
not
a
very
safe
procedure
then
either.
further,
to
just
kind
of
summarize
some
of
the
other
things
that
have
come
up,
the
state
in
its
supplemental
authorities
did
refer
to
this
legislative
study
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
some
information
in
there
and
in
that--
i
think
that
study
shows
that
it’s
the
interest
of
the
woman
and
not
the
fetus
involved,
and
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
information
in
there
that’s
not
contained
anywhere
else
and
that
is
that
there
were
about
60
or
70
abortions
performed
in
georgia
during
the
measles,
german
measles
academic
of
‘64
and
’65
and
that
did
place
a
lot
of
doctors
in
jeopardy,
and
i
think
that
there
are
now
compelling
reasons,
be
they
socio
or
economic
reasons,
just
as
valid
for
performing
abortions.
thank
you
very
much.
