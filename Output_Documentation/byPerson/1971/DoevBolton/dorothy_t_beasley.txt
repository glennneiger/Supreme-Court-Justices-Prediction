ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
very
knot
of
the
argument
before
this
court
and
the
issue
facing
this
court
is
the
value
which
is
to
be
placed
on
fetal
life.
the
state
in
this
case
takes
the
position
that
fetal
life
is
to
be
protected,
that
it
is
a
protectable
interest.
the
question
is
whether
there
should
be
no
value
placed
on
it
so
that
a
woman
may,
in
her
own
decision
and
with
her
own
doctor
determine
without
any
intervention
by
the
state
that
she
may
abort
a
pregnancy
after
she
has
conceived
and
is
carrying
a
live
human
fetus.
or
rather
on
the
other
hand,
the
state
itself
may
protect
the
interest
of
that
fetus
in
any
regard.
the
court
below
determines
that
the
state
interest
or
the
state
was
attempting
to
go
too
far
in
protecting
the
fetal
life.
but
that
it
could
protect
to
some
degree
because
it
could
prohibit
those
abortions
which
were
not
necessary
in
the
best
critical
judgment
of
the
physician
taking
into
consideration
that
not
only
medical
factors
but
really
everything
involved
in
the
particular
case.
the
woman’s
economic
position,
her
family
physician,
and
so
on.
but
at
any
rate,
the
court
did
indicate
that
the
state
had
an
interest
in
protecting
fetal
life
at
least
to
that
extent.
now,
if
the
court
of
course
said
well,
you
can
have
an
abortion
in
any
event
whether
it
is
necessary
or
not
then
of
course
it
would
be
consistent
with
the
argument
that
is
made
by
the
appellants.
however,
they
said
the
state
does
have
an
opportunity
to
control
those
abortions
which
are
not
necessary.
they
may
prohibit
them,
period.
i
think
a
great
mistake
has
been
made
by
that
court
and
by
appellants
in
saying
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
single.
that
is
there
is
only
a
help
measure.
in
the
first
place
it
is
in
the
criminal
code.
as
a
separate
bill,
it
was
introduced
to
amend
a
part
of
the
criminal
code.
the
original
bill
or
the
original
statute
in
1876
was
a
criminal
action.
and
it
speaks
of
the
unborn
child.
it
does
not
speak
of
a
thing
or
an
organism
but
it
speaks
of
protecting
the
unborn
child
and
that
is
at
least
one
of
the
interests
of
the
state
in
the
statute.
i
submit
that
there
are
three,
if
you
read
the
whole
statute
in
its
entirety.
number
one
and
the
underlying
reason
is
the
protection
of
fetal
life
from
wanting
or
arbitrary
destruction
simply
upon
the
convenience
or
the
desire
of
the
woman
who
is
bearing
it.
secondly,
of
course
the
state
is
interested
in
protecting
women
who
are
going
to
undergo
a
very
serious
procedure
at
any
stage
and
that
is
the
abortion
procedure
and
that
of
course
is
indicated
by
the
very
serious
procedure
that
is
set
out
by
not
only
having
her
own
physician
think
that
she
could
have
one
but
in
getting
consultants
and
also
approved
by
the
hospital
abortion
committee
and
requirement
to
be
done
in
the
hospital
which
by
the
way
has
certainly
been
the
position
of
the
american
life
association
and
house
of
delegates
in
1967
which
was
just
one
year
prior
to
the
time
this
statute
was
enacted
and
has,
in
my
understanding
at
least,
been
in
the
position
of
the
american
college
of
obstetricians
and
gynecologists
in
their
standards
and
in
their
latest
standard
with
regard
to
abortions
as
i
read
it
and
of
course
this
is
not
before
the
court.
and
i
just
make
them
aside
for
a
moment
to
say
that
that
is
one
of
the
troubles
with
this
case.
it
is
facial
attack
on
the
constitutionality
statute
and
all
the
statistics
and
what
the
doctors
think
on
one
side
or
on
the
other
and
whether
the
abortions
are
safer
than
child
birth
and
so
on
are
not
really
before
any
court
because
they
were
not
introduced
into
evidence
in
the
court
below.
so
they
are
not
part
of
the
record.
now
certainly
the
appellants
tried
to
present
evidence
and
in
the
only
hearing
that
was
held
before
the
lower
court
which
nearly
lasted
about
two
hours
at
the
most,
there
was
an
argument
but
both
sides
came
prepared
to
present
evidence
and
of
course
in
order
to
attack
the
constitutionality
as
to
its
effect
or
its
operation
in
georgia
or
its
applicability,
i
submit
that
we
would
need
a
fuller
record
and
that
is
an
attack
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
it
cannot
be
supported
without
looking
at
these
further
facts
unless
we
can
say
that
the
state
has
no
interest
whatsoever
in
protecting
fetal
life.
and
i
think
that
the
interest
which
the
fetus
has
as
human
fetus
in
this
instance
becomes
broader
as
time
goes
on.
i
think
the
state
has
a
greater
obligation
to
protect
that
fetal
life
today
than
it
did
in
1876.
and
for
this
reason,
it
is
more
protectable
now
than
it
ever
was
before.
there
are
more
methods
now
that
can
be
used
to
protect
them
including
blood
transfusion
and
surgery
while
it
is
still
in
the
womb.
now
this
i
think
has
been
brought
to
the
court’s
attention
in
some
degree
that
has
filed
by
the
physician.
but
at
any
rate
there
are
more
possible
ways
now
for
example,
the
very
growth
of
the
science
of
fetology
which
is
of
course
the
treatment
of
the
fetus
before
it
is
born.
so,
its
development,
it
has
been
created
and
its
development
up
to
the
period
of
birth
is
such
now
than
it
can
be
protected
by
the
state
and
so
i
think
there
is
a
greater
duty
upon
the
state
to
do
so.
now
the
question
which
i
think
comes
here
with
regard
to
these
exceptions
is
the
balancing
of
competing
interests.
the
state
certainly
takes
no
position
that
the
woman
has
a
constitutional
right
to
abortion.
we
have
not
been
shown
where
that
right
emanates
from.
if
it
emanates
from
the
considerations
which
was
given
in
the
griswold
case,
i
think
it
is
erroneous
because
in
that
case,
there
was
not
the
introduction
of
another
entity.
a
person
has
a
right
to
be
let
alone,
certainly.
but
not
when
another
person
is
involved
or
another
per
human
entity
is
involved.
the
same
thing
with
the
marriage
relationship,
here
a
third
entity
is
involved
and
the
state
says
you
may
not
indiscriminately
dispose
off
or
discontinue
the
life
of
that
third
entity
except
in
various
special
circumstances.
now
this
is
where
we
get
to
the
competing
interest
and
the
balancing
of
the
interest
which
by
the
way
think
was
a
statement
in
recognition
that
former
mr.
justice
clark
made
in
his
law
review
article
about
the
state
being
in
the
position
to
balance
imputing
interests.
i
would
say
if
you
have
a
fetus
growing
in
the
woman
on
one
side
and
a
woman
that
she
does
not
want
it,
you
got
a
class
of
interest
there.
now,
the
state
has
taken
a
position
where
we
are
not
going
to
prohibit
all
abortions
because
we
understand
that
there
are
circumstances
in
which
a
woman
should
be
able
to
destroy
that
fetus
because
her
interest
is
superior.
and
there
are
three
broad
reasons
now
that
are
given
in
our
statute
of
course
which
was
struck
out
by
the
court
below
so
that
we
cannot
here
really
argue
those
although
we
attempted
to
bring
an
appeal
here
which
was
denied
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
and
our
appeal
is
awaiting,
its
further
pursuit
in
the
fifth
circuit.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
thank
you
very
much.
underlying
the
exceptions
or
the
reasons
for
the
exception
in
the
statute
is
the
broad
principle
of
self-preservation.
we
recognize
that
a
human
being
has
a
right
ultimately
of
self-defense
and
i
think
that
these
exceptions
are
manifestations
of
that.
we
allow
a
woman
to
abort
a
fetus,
if
it
is
a
product
of
rape.
now
that
has
been
construed
in
our
state,
it
will
also
include
incest.
this
is
the
product
of
course
in
that
situation
of
an
unwarranted,
uninvited
attack
on
her.
and
to
require
her
to
bear
that
child
is
almost
a
punishment
or
at
least
she
would
often
require
regard
it
as
a
punishment
so
here
she
can
defend
herself
from
that
fetus
by
destroying
it.
secondly,
as
far
as
the
fetus
which
is
gravely
malformed
and
will
be
permanently
malformed
or
deficient,
the
state
recognizes,
i
think
the
very
practical
exception
because
it
recognizes
that
in
most
cases,
she
is
the
one
who
is
going
to
have
to
raise
that
child
and
the
state
is
not
now
in
a
position
where
it
can
automatically
taking
all
of
these
children
and
of
course
it
would
be
a
great
deal
of
heart
break
to
her
and
so
it
would
involve
her
own
well-being
and
the
state
says,
in
these
circumstances,
science
is
not
enough
developed
so
that
we
can
correct
these
deformities.
the
state
cannot
help
enough
in
these
circumstances
and
therefore
we
regard
it
as
an
exception
and
allow
you
to
defend
yourself
against
the
circumstances
which
will
arise
if
you
have
to
bear
and
keep
this
child.
the
third
one
of
course
is
the
preservation
of
her
own
life
or
her
own
health.
and
of
course
it
has
been
construed
not
judicially
but
as
a
matter
of
factors
that
help
here
includes
mental
health.
now
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
i
did
and
i
say
this
only
from
an
observation
of
the
reports
that
has
been
collected
by
the
georgia
department
public
health
to
whom
all
abortions
of
course
are
reported.
that
again
is
not
in
the
record
because
there
was
no
evidence
presented.
however,
particularly
since
the
period
of
the
court
decision.
the
reasons
that
are
reported
in
by
the
physicians
that
are
performing
abortions,
have
been
expanded
so
that
not
only
have
you
got
rape
and
incest
separate
and
not
only
do
we
have
for
mental
problems
or
physical
problems
so
that
a
maternal
--you
also
have
economic
and
social
now
being
given
as
a
separate
category
and
reason.
so
that
brings
me
to
the
point
that
an
injunction
is
not
needed
also.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that
is
right
but
no
one
has
brought
the
matter
to
the
attention
of
the
georgia
courts
and
i
would
dispute.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
as
far
as
the
social
and
economic
things
are
concerned.
i
think
your
question
as
to
the
rape
or
incest
as
suggested
before,
i
am
not
certain
of
that
but
i
think
it
would
because
the
court
decision
would
make
no
distinction
or
broaden
it
necessarily.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that
is
correct
but
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
clearly.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
indeed,
it
has
happened
since
then
and
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
very
reasons
why
no
injunction
would
be
necessary.
in
the
first
place,
the
parties
against
the
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
until
it
has
changed,
otherwise
but
if
the
state
of
course
takes
position
that
the
statute
is
constitutional
as
it
was
written.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
if
the
judgment
below
were
to
be
affirmed,
certainly,
there
is
no
indication
that
the
state
and
the
district
attorneys
and
the
hospital
abortion
committees
would
not
follow
the
mandate
of
this
court
as
has
been
done.
no
prosecutions
have
been
brought
despite
the
fact
of
the
reporting
of
these
other
extra
statutory
abortions.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
indeed.
and
so
there
would
be
no
purpose
for
an
injunction
because
it
is
being
abate
of
a
declaratory
judgment.
moreover,
an
injunction
against
anyone
of
the
defending
parties
would
really
lead
nowhere
because
the
attorney
general
of
course
does
not
want
to
bring
prosecutions
in
the
first
place
and
has
no
connection
whatsoever
with
the
hospital
abortion
committee
despite
what
the
court
below
believed.
another
suit
as
a
matter
of
fact
was
instituted
last
year
against
the
fulton
and
dekalb
hospital
authority,
a
body
of
politic
and
corporate
doing
business
with
grady
memorial
hospital.
and
that
is
where
you
get
the
abortion
committee
in
the
hospital.
and
the
attorney
general
has
not
idea
what
the
abortion
committee
in
this
particular
case
did
or
how
much
it
knew
and
that
again
is
one
of
the
great
problems
with
this
case.
we
now
no
facts.
there
are
no
facts
in
this
case.
no
established
facts.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
the
court
apparently
believed
that
it
was
not
necessary
because
they
were
going
to
consider
as
a
facial
attack
only.
and
i
think
the
court
made
a
mistake
in
that
circumstance.
i
think
they
have
confused
these
two
things.
one,
whether
you
need
facts
to
establish
a
justiciable
controversy
and
two,
whether
you
need
facts
and
a
concrete
circumstance
in
order
to
decide
facial
unconstitutionality.
and
i
think
they
jumped
to
the
second
situation
and
said
well,
we
are
going
to
just
look
at
the
statute
anyway
and
so
the
facts
do
not
matter.
and
i
would
submit
that,
that
is
a
wrong
circumstance
even
the
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
say
there
was
not.
there
was
not
a
case
of
controversy.
the
attorney
general,
the
district
attorney
of
fulton
county,
and
the
chief
of
police
of
the
city
of
atlanta
had
no
case
or
controversy
whatsoever
with
mary
doe
or
any
of
the
doctors
or
nurses
or
organizations
or
ministers
or
counselors.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
think
the
controversy
is
with
the,
whoever
the
denied
the
abortion.
that
is
it
may
have
been
the
committee.
i
think
that
that
will
have
to
–-
they
will
have
to
an
important
party.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
think
you
would
indeed
have
a
case
of
controversy
there.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no
sir,
not
with
the
attorney
general,
with
those
who
were
implementing
the
law.
the
attorney
general
would
be
interested
and
would
undoubtedly
as
required
by
law.
he
would
file
a
brief.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
and
that
is
not
the
attorney
general.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
it
would
be
the
district
attorney.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
he
is
one
of
the
appellees
mr.
justice.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that
is
indeed
correct.
of
course
the
chief
of
police
would
not
bring
a
prosecution
and
there
were
no
prosecutions
or
threats.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
you
may
but
there
was
not
enforcement
during
which
was
threatened
or
impending.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
but
we
do
not
know
that
it
was
pursuant
to
the
law.
you
are
assuming
i
believe
another
circumstance
that
there
was
compliance
with
the
law.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
it
alleged
that
that
was
the
reason
but
again
they
also
stated
that
they
did
not
know
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
am
sorry
i
did
not
hear
your
question.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no
sir,
i
think
it
must
appear
in
the
–-
as
the
case
proceeds.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
think
there
are
not
enough
facts
there.
no.
no
case
of
controversy.
not
with
these
defendants.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
thank
you.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
we
were
seeking,
i
think
when
we
started
our
case
of
controversy
and
i
think
that
is
very
clear
that
a
case
of
controversy
would
exist
with
a
hospital
of
abortion
committee
and
all
the
constitutional
questions
which
are
sought
to
be
raised
and
argued
in
this
case
could
be
brought
there.
i
think
also
that
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that
is
correct
if
there
were
a
threat.
but
here
we
have
enough
case
of
controversy
and
a
threat
of
course,
would
involved
the
anti-injunction
statute
i
think
rather
than
whether
it
could
by
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
a
threat
might.
if
the
proper
price
were
involved
but
here
for
example
we
do
not
have
as
far
as
we
know
we
do
not
have
mary
doe’s
doctor.
someone
who
was
taking
any
action
and
even
in
the
cases
which
the
court
recently
has
considered
about
the
facial
constitutionality
for
some
criminal
statutes,
there
was
an
actual
case
of
controversy
or
not
even
with
regard
to
the
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
do
not
know.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no
sir.
we
know
no
facts
about
her
at
all.
we
assume
that
since
there
is
an
affidavit
concerning
it
that
those
facts
may
very
well
be
true
but
we
have
had
no
opportunity
to
see
whether
there
are
other
facts.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that
is
correct.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
the
court
below
accepted
as
far
as
i
know
the
statements
that
were
made
in
allegation
as
being
true.
so
that
no
proof
was
submitted,
no
interrogatories
were
answered.
we
had
no
opportunity
to
find
out.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
through
counsel.
that
is
correct.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that
is
what
counsel
informs
us
as
correct.
she
was
not
pointed
out.
she
did
not
stand
up
in
court
for
example
and
indicate
herself
to
the
court
but
we
just
understand
that
she
was
there,
we
do
not
know
who
she
was.
there
was
a
courtroom
full
of
people.
so
we
could
not
follow
up
to
see
it
in
any
way.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
pardon.
i
am
sorry.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
if
her
allegations
are
accepted?
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
because
it
was
not
a
complete
divulgence
of
the
facts
surrounding
her
circumstance.
for
example,
we
do
not
know
that
the
hospital
abortion
committee
knew
as
much
about
her
as
in
her
allegations.
we
do
not
know
the
real
reason
for
which
they
denied
her
of
the
abortion.
particularly
since
she
was
assertedly
granted
the
approval
of
another
hospital
abortion
committee
which
again
makes
her
situation
somewhat
moot
because
she
did
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no
sir,
mr.
justice
douglas,
we
think
that
the
statute
itself
in
total
does
not
render
any
lack
of
due
process
or
equal
protection
on
its
face
to
any
of
these
plaintiffs
or
anyone
else.
we
think
that
the
statute
is
a
constitutional
one
as
of
writ
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
if
this
court
decides
that
the
restrictions
that
were
made
on
the
statute
are
correct
and
a
declaratory
judgment
should
issue,
we
would
think
that
would
indeed
be
proper
and
that
an
injunction
would
not
be
necessary.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
we
think
not
because
we
find
no
necessity
and
of
course
injunction
is
extraordinary
legal
relief.
injunction
against
anyone
of
these
appellees
would
do
nothing
as
far
as
the
enforcement
that
is
not
already
being
done
as
far
as
the
statute
is
concerned.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
there
may
be
situation
in
which
an
injunction
would
be
appropriate
but
not
in
this
circumstance
where
there
is
no
–-
well,
if
the
court
considers
that
there
is
a
case
of
controversy
there
still
would
not
be
a
need
for
an
injunction.
of
course
injunction
being
a
discretionary
type
of
thing
and
the
court
below
finding
no
necessity
for
one,
we
think
that
was
a
correct
finding
by
the
court
and
so
there
should
be
no
necessity
for
this
court
to
direct
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes
sir.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes
sir
if
it
became
necessary.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
indeed.
i
think
that
there
would
be
a
continuing
opportunity
to
do
so.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no
sir.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no
mr.
justice
stewart,
there
were
nothing
at
all
as
far
as
those
are
concerned.
not
even
a
threat.
and
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
makes
it
so
different
from
the
wisconsin
versus
constantineau
case
where
there
was
something
actually
done.
it
was
conduct
there
taken
on
behalf
of
the
officials
of
the
state
in
that
case
the
chief
of
police,
i
believe
it
was,
which
we
do
not
have
here
at
all.
i
would
like
to
point
out
one
other
thing
though.
we
were
mentioning
to
the
court
the
purposes
of
the
statute.
i
think
one
of
the
other
purposes
of
it.
i
think
there
are
primarily
three
being
to
protect
fetal
life
and
of
course
the
health
of
the
mother
and
having
to
go
through
this
procedure
and
also
to
protect
doctors
who
are
going
to
perform
therapeutic
abortions.
the
procedure
is
set
out
and
they
are
protected.
and
if
they
stay
within
those
wide
protections
that
are
given
in
statutes.
the
procedure
that
is
given
and
the
district
attorney
has
no
basis
on
which
to
refer
an
indictment
against
them
and
of
course
the
burden
would
be
on
him
to
show
that
the
abortion
was
not
necessary.
so
i
think
the
statute
is
also
to
protect
the
doctors
so
that
they
can
operate
with
regard
to
therapeutic
abortions.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that
is
correct.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no,
it
is
not.
not
that
i
know
of.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
because
abortions
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that
is
right.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
one
other
point
i
would
like
to
make
and
that
is
this.
in
another
area,
the
state
does
recognize
fetal
life
as
being
human
life
and
that
but
that
is
with
regard
to
fetal
death
certificates
which
are
required
to
be
filed
when
there
is
a
fetal
death.
and
that
portion
of
the
statute
which
deals
with
(inaudible)
arrangements
and
so
on
and
vital
records,
the
distinction
is
made
between
life,
birth,
and
fetal
death.
life,
birth
is
regarded
as
situation
where
a
product
of
conception
that
whatever
stage
it
occurs
is
expelled
or
extracted
from
a
mother’s
womb
and
there
is
evidence
of
life
which
means
–-
and
some
examples
are
given
in
the
statute;
voluntary
muscle
movement
or
heartbeat
or
something
that
indicates
breathing
or
movement.
sone
independent
activity
in
that
fetal
life
and
that
is
regarded
as
a
life
birth.
a
fetal
death
is
regarded
as
that
type
of
extraction
where
there
is
no
evidence
of
life.
so
i
think
in
that
instance
too,
the
state
carries
forward
this
consistent
concept
and
attitude
towards
pre-birth
children
and
that
they
are
indeed
human
life
that
needs
to
be
recorded
and
that
should
be
very
carefully
watched
before
there
is
any
destruction
of
it.
and
i
think
that
in
closing,
i
would
like
to
just
say
that
we
looked
at
a
criminal
defendant
and
say
before
he
is
going
to
be
condemned,
his
guilt
must
be
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
now,
we
look
that
at
an
unborn
child
and
say
can
we
now
at
least
limit
the
destruction
of
his
life
to
these
certain
circumstances
or
see
as
an
innocent
human
life
allowed
to
be
extinguished
without
any
regard
whatsoever.
thank
you.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
underlying
this
suit
is
an
appeal
by
pregnant
women
to
the
federal
judiciary
and,
particularly,
this
court
for
an
annunciation
that
they
have
a
right
secured
by
our
constitution
to
procure
the
destruction
of
their
living
unborn
children.
they
make
this
plea
because
the
people
of
the
state
of
georgia
forbid
abortion
except
in
certain
circumstances
which
the
people
of
the
state
through
our
legislature
believe
constitute
justifiable
homicide.
i
do
not
directly
represent
the
unborn
children
here,
nor
the
child
of
mary
doe
who
is
probably
now
two
years
old.
their
representation
by
a
guardian
at
litem
was
denied
by
the
court
below.
i
do,
however,
represent
three
state
and
local
officials
of
the
government
at
this
argument
and,
at
that
capacity,
i
do
represent
the
state
in
defending
the
statute
attacked.
the
state
is
parens
patriae
here,
exerting
the
power
of
guardianship
over
persons
on
a
disability
standing
as
it
were
in
local
parentis
or
in
place
of
the
parent.
here,
the
mother,
in
defending
the
unborn
child.
now,
before
we
get
into
whatever
issues
there
may
be
before
this
court,
with
respect
to
that
very
basic
fundamental
underlying
issue.
i
think
we
must
look
at
it
in
the
context
of
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
for
which
the
proposition
in
presented.
mary
doe
and
the
other
appellants,
whom
i
wish
to
prefer
to
as
plaintiffs
because
i
think
they
had
no
business
here
as
the
parents,
brought
this
action
under
section
12--
excuse
me,
1983.
this
is
a
1983
action
which
was
brought
in
the
federal
court
below
and
a
three-judge
court
was
requested.
that
action
which
gives
them
a
cause
or
a
right
of
our
claim
says
that
every
person
who
under
color
of
any
state
statute
subjects
or
cause
to
be
subjected
any
citizen
to
the
deprivation
of
any
rights
which
are
protected
by
the
constitution
has
a
cause
of
action.
so,
we
must
start
out
first
with
what
right
under
the
constitution
is
being
abridged
or
what
right
is
mary
doe
and
the
other
plaintiffs
alleging
exists.
the
burden
is
on
mary
doe
to
show
what
the
constitutional
right
is
in
the
first
place
before
she
has
a
course
of
action,
and
that
question
comes
before
this
court
because
this
court
has
not
yet
ruled
on
its
jurisdiction.
its
jurisdiction
depends
on
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court.
if
the
district
court
didn’t
have
jurisdiction
over
this
1983
case,
obviously
there
would
be
no
jurisdiction
in
this
court.
now,
to
begin
with,
since
she
must
show
what
this
right
is
and
the
burden
in
on
her,
this
court
could
decide
that
question
which
is
a
part
of
its
jurisdictional
question
because
if
there
was
no
constitutional
right
in
the
beginning,
then
the
district
court
had
no
business
looking
at
the
state
statute
and
measuring
it
against
that
constitutional
right.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that’s
right.
if
there
was
no
constitutional
right
in
the
first
place,
there’s
no
1983
action.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
indeed,
but
if
that
constitutional
right
is
lacking,
thyen
it
has
no
jurisdiction
to
go
any
further
because
then
there
is
no
deprivation
of
a
constitutional
right.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
not
at
all.
you
don’t
need
a
three-judge
court
to
decide
if
there’s
a
constitutional
right.
you
needed
a
three-judge
court
to
determine
if
there
should
be
an
injunction.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
you
probably
would
have
to
make
that
determination.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that’s
right,
and
that’s
why
the
question
is
ultimately
here
because
this
court
must
determine
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
below
so
that
we
say
that
all
these
arguments
and
all
these
statistics
with
regard
to
the
statute
itself
are
irrelevant
to
the
argument
here.
that
they
have
nothing
to
do
at
all
with
the
argument
here
because
mary
doe
and
the
other
plaintiffs
cannot
establish
the
constitutional
right
in
the
beginning
which
they
say
was
abridged
by
the
existence
of
the
statute.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
right,
exactly,
and
that’s
why
i
think
this
court
at
least--
excuse
me,
has
jurisdiction,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
to
determine
that
a
woman
does
not
have
a
right
secured
by
our
constitution
to
terminate
the
life
of
her
unborn
child
arbitrarily.
this
court
can
make
that
determination
in
this
suit
despite
all
the
other
lack
of
jurisdiction
of
the
court
below
with
regard
to
operation
of
the
statute
or
the
application
of
the
statute,
all
these
peripheral
issues.
now
the
burden,
as
i
said,
is
on
the
woman
who
is
exerting
this
so-called
right
to
establish
that
she
has
it.
that
it
is
secured
by
our
constitution,
but
i
still
admit
that
it
is
not.
there
is
no
such
right
and
for
several
reasons
that
i
think
are
very
fundamental.
abortion,
of
course,
is
the
killing
of
a
human
fetus
or
embryo.
the
victim
of
criminal
abortion
is
the
fetus,
not
the
mother.
the
victim
is
the
fetus.
so,
it’s
a
crime
recognized
by
the
state
against
the
unborn
child,
and
that
was
one
reason
why
i
brought
to
your
attention
that
little
booklet
established
by
the
state
in
1922
in
a
supplemental
authorities.
it’s
called
in
loco
parentis
and
it
was
published
by
the
state
welfare
department
and
it
has
to
do
with
all
the
statutes
of
the
state
and
the
decisions
of
the
state
protecting
children
and
under
the
catching
laws
protecting
children
are
crimes
against
children
and
that’s
where
abortion
is
discussed,
1922.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that’s
correct
and
that’s--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that
is
precisely
one
of
the
manifestations
of
the
state’s
interest
not
only
in
the
mother,
but
also
in
the
unborn
child.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
not
at
all,
but
there,
again,
the
great
distinction
is
that
there
is
not
another
entity--
human
entity
involved
which
there
is
here
and
that’s
the
source
of
the
protection
here.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
the
state--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
don’t
think
a
constitutional
basis
would
be
involved,
but
under
the
police
power
of
the
united--
of
the
state
to
protect
health
and
safety,
it
could
proscribe
tonsillectomies
at
least
so
that
it
was
related
to
health.
now,
if
it
might
be
overbroad
because,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
tonsillectomies
may
not
be
dangerous
and
may
be
a
health
measure,
but
that
has
little
to
do
with
the
purpose
of
the
state
in
prohibiting
abortion.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
because
that
would
be
a
health
measure
and
despite
what
the--
mary
doe
and
the
other
plaintiffs
or
appellants
say
here
and
despite
what
the
court
said
below,
the
purpose
of
this
abort--
criminal
abortion
statute
of
georgia
is
not--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
it
does
indeed.
it’s
a
very
direct
restriction
on
the
performance
of
such
operations.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
so--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
go
ahead,
mr.
justice
marshall.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that’s
right.
there
is
a
balancing
of
the
interests
which
we
have
talked
about
so
much.
under
the
19--
mary
doe
suggests
that
she
has
a
right
which
emanates
from--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes.
well
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
we
used
to
have
capital
punishment
statutes.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
not
a
commission
of
three
people.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
excuse
me,
not
as
to
whether
he
lives
or
dies.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
but
there
is--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no,
i’m
not
saying
that.
what
i’m
saying
is
this.
under
our
constitution,
obviously
as
mr.
justice
stewart
said,
a
person
that’s
born
has
all
the
protections
that
the
constitution
has
to
offer,
but
there
is
a
gray
area
where
we
don’t
know
when
life
as
such
begins
or
humanity
or
a
person
or
any
other
term
by
which
we
want
to
call
it.
obviously,
life
occurs
before
birth
because
there’s
movement
and
all--
medicine
recognizes
that.
so,
let’s
not
talk
about
life
then.
let’s
just
say
personhood
which,
of
course,
is
not
a
medical
term
at
all.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
there’s
a
gray
area
and
that
is
the
area
in
which
we
say
the
state
has
a
right
to
determine
by
its
legislature
how
far
it
will
go
in
protecting
that
because
it’s
a
matter
of
public
policy.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
indeed,
it
is
a
living
being
and
i
don’t
think
anybody
could
dispute
that.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
because
the
state
also
recognizes
the
competing
interest
of
self-preservation
that
the
mother
has
in
extreme
circumstances,
the
statute
doesn’t
allow--
the
exceptions
are
not
broad.
the
exceptions
are
very
narrow.
the
health
must
be
very
seriously
impaired.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
think
that’s
a
matter
of
terminology.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
of
course.
let’s
call
it
the
fetus
then.
the
state,
it
is
our
position,
has
a
right
in
this
gray
area
where
it
can’t
say
the
particular
moment
at
which
the
state
can
protect
human
beings
or
fetuses
or
whatever
area
on
the
continuum
of
life
that
you
want
to
talk
about,
but
there
is
a
right,
we
think,
that
a
human
being
has
which
emanates
from
the
ninth
amendment
itself
because
those
rights
are
retained
by
the
people
under
the
ninth
amendment,
and--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
if
you
recognize
both,
then
you
simply
would
have
to
justify
some--
find
some
common
medium
way
in
order
to
deal
with
both
conflicting
interests.
that’s
what’s
really
at
issue
here,
the
conflicting
interests
between
the
two,
but
under
the
common
law
and
under
natural
law,
according
to
blackstone
&
co.,
and
we
still
rely
on
those
despite
what
professor
means
may
say
and
i
cite
to
the
court
strongly
the
history
of
the
common
law
which
is
put
out
in
an
1865
book
which
we
cited
in
our
first
brief
as
storer
and
heard
book
describing
the
cases
before
any
statute
was
enacted
in
england
where
abortion
was
regarded
as
a
crime.
it
was
not
a
felony.
you’ve
asked
the
question
earlier
if
it
was
a
felony.
no,
it
was
a
misdemeanor
but,
regardless
of
whether
it
was
a
felony
or
misdemeanor
at
common
law,
it
was
regarded
as
a
misdemeanor
in
georgia
and
although
they
are
not
cases
before
the
statute
was
enacted
in
1865,
the
cases
around
that
time
including
the
1849
case
of
morrow
versus
scott
speak
of
the
unborn
child
as
having
any
right
which
a
state
was
able
to
give
it,
whatever
rights
were
protectable
insofar
as
it
was
protectable.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
i
apologize
for
so
late
providing
for
the
court
the
legislative
history
such
as
it
is
in
north
carolina
population
center
study
on
this
statute,
but
it
indicates
in
there
that
the
thought
was
that
rape
included
incest
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
statistics
which
are
kept
by
the
georgia
department
of
health
internal
health
section
classify
incest
separately
from
rape
and
indicate
that
prior
to
the
time
the
statute
was
emasculated
by
the
court
below,
abortions
were
being
performed
and
were
being
reported
and
were
not
being
prosecuted
under
the
title
incest
as
opposed
to
rape
so
that,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
has
secluded
that.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that’s
right.
there
were
two.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
sir.
thank
you
for
asking
about
them.
i
submitted
those
for
this
proposition
to
show
that
even
though
the
statute
had
been
passed
in
1968,
there
are
still
efforts
being
made
to
change
it
and
that,
despite
the
fact
that
after
the
district
court
changed
the
statute
and
really
wrote
its
own
statute
because
it
gave
an
entirely
different
purpose
to
the
statute
than
the
legislature
had,
efforts
were
made
and
they
were
still
knocked
down.
those
statutes
were
not
passed
because
they
were
too
liberal
with
respect
to
dealing
with
the
fetus.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no,
it
isn’t.
i
moved
very
likely
to
file
supplemental
authorities
and
i
simply
listed
them
because
i
felt
that,
as
shown
by
the
stack
in
front
of
you
mr.
justice
douglas,
there
were
so
many
briefs
that
it
would
be
superfluous
for
me
to
submit
another
supplemental
brief.
so,
i
simply
listed
the
authorities
so
that
i
might
be
able
to
talk
to
you
about
them
in
argument.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
it
might
be
under
a
health
measure,
a
policy
to
protect
health,
but
that’s
not
what’s
involved
here.
this
is
not
to
protect
the
health
of
the
person
who
wants
the
operation
which
is
what
you
would
have
in
the
open
heart
surgery.
legislation
to
protect
the
life
or
the
health,
and
the
police
power
comes
in
there
to
protect
the
life
of
the
one
who
wants
it
or
the
one
whose
doctor
thinks
they
already
have
it.
but,
that’s
not
the
purpose
of
the
georgia
abortion
statute.
it
is
not
health
related
or
health--
primarily
health
related.
that
is
not
its
primary
purpose
and
i
think
that
this
study
of
the
north
carolina
population
center
which,
by
the
way
in
the
very
preference
to
the
study,
says
that
the
reason
they
were
doing
it
was
to
assist
those
who
might
be
trying
to
get
more
liberal
abortion
legislation,
so
that
the
study
was
not
done
for
us
or
for
my--
our
stand
point
at
all,
but
it
shows
underlying
all
of
the
consideration
that
was
given
in
the
passage
of
this
bill
in
1968
which
was
proposed
actually
in
1967.
it
was
carried
over
and
there
were
public
hearings,
and
so
on.
the
underlying
assumption
and
basic
foundation
was
we
are
not
going
to
destroy
fetal
health
or
fetal
life
except
in
very
unusual
and
exceptional
extreme
circumstances.
the
basic
proposition
is
we
don’t
destroy
it,
and
i
submit
that
it’s
up
to
the--
up
to
mary
doe
to
show
that
there
is.
she
has
to
have
the
burden.
she
has
the
burden
of
showing
what
the
justification
is
because
it
is
a
natural
rate
under
an
order
of
things
emanating
from
the
ninth
amendment
to
be
let
alone,
and
that,
we
say,
is
what
the
right
which
the
fetus
has.
the
right
to
be
let
alone
and
not
to
be
stopped
in
its
growth
towards
birth
at
a
time
which
would
be
premature
and,
despite
the
fact
that
perhaps
now
as
we
look
at
all
the
authorities,
perhaps
when
the
statute
were
first
passed
and
ours
was
1876
or
1859
in
texas
then.
perhaps
the
original
purpose
was
to
protect
the
health
of
the
woman
from
aseptic
surgery,
but
purposes
evolve
and
change.
things
are
not
static.
our
constitution
is
not
static,
and
we
now
have
a
showing
by
the
study
which
is
done
by
north
carolina
and,
by
looking
at
the
statute
itself,
we
don’t
even
have
to
go
to
the
north
carolina
study,
but
looking
at
the
statute
itself
shows
that
the
purpose
has
evolved
to
protect
this
fetus
and,
as
an
illustration
of
that,
let
me
point
to
the
very
procedure
which
is
being
attacked
here.
the
procedure
involves
four
doctors
or
six.
there’s
some
question
about
whether
the
hospital
committee
can
include
the
two
consultants,
but
let’s
say
six.
they
are
not
required
by
the
statute
to
determine
whether
the
method
that’s
used
for
the
abortion
is
safe
or
not,
or
whether
the
woman
is
too
far
advanced
to
undergo
abortion.
all
they
are
required
to
do
under
the
statute
is
to
determine
whether
the
abortion
should
be
performed,
whether
it
comes
within
one
of
the
exceptions.
that’s
all.
they
don’t
make
a
medical
judgment
about
the
operation
itself.
what
they’re
concerned
about
is,
is
this
an
instance?
is
this
an
extreme
instance
in
which
we
should
allow
the
fetus
to
be
destroyed?
that’s
all,
and
that
shows
that
the
purpose
is
the
fetus’
protection.
look
also
at
the
exceptions,
the
three
exceptions.
if
it
were
that
the
purpose
of
the
exceptions
was
any
time
that
it
was
for
the
woman’s
desire
or
want,
it
would
deal
only
with
her
own
health,
but
the
exception
are
only
when
extreme
circumstances
of
self-preservation
or
self-defense
as
far
as
she’s
concerned,
not
things
that
have
to
do
with
her
health.
so,
i
think
the
statute
itself
shows
that
the
underlying
purpose
is
the
protection
of
fetal
life.
also,
i
think
that,
very
clearly,
the
part
that
was
struck
out
by
the
court
below
with
respect
to
the
action
which
was
a
statutory
action
to
be
brought
in
a
superior
court
for
the
trial
of
the
fetus’
underlying
constitutional
or
other
rights.
that
shows
clearly
that
the
legislature’s
purpose
was
to
protect
the
fetus
from
being
destroyed.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i’d
like
to
point
out
at
this
juncture
again,
with
respect
to
jurisdiction,
that
the
right
which
mary
doe
is
asserting
here
as
being
protected
by
the
constitution
is
really
not
the
right
that
she
asserts
in
her
brief,
and
i
say
that
for
this
reason.
she
doesn’t
disagree
with
the
court
below
and
the
statute
that
it
made.
although
it
found
the
basis
of
the
statute
or
the
purpose
of
the
statute
to
be
health
oriented,
it
said
the
state
has
some
interest
in
protecting
fetal
life.
the
state
does
have
an
interest
which
it
can
assert
by
statute
and,
therefore,
the
district
court-made
statute
recognized
from
the
very
beginning
that
there
was
something
protectable
by
the
state
prior
to
birth.
so,
i
say
that
mary
doe
is
beat
from
the
beginning
because
she
doesn’t
come
to
this
court
and
say
the
district
court’s
statute
is
overbroad,
but
she
only
says
that
it’s
vague.
so
that,
what
we
have
here
is
not
a
question
as
to
whether
a
woman
has
a
constitutional
right
to
abort
any
pregnancy,
but
whether
she
has
one
in
the
terms
that
the
district
court
outlined,
that
is
one
that
is
not
necessary
in
the
best
clinical
judgment
of
the
physician.
now,
i
say
that
supports
the
state’s
physician
because
that’s
a
recognition
by
the
court
below
that
there
is
protectable
fetal
life
and
that
it
becomes
a
matter
of
degree
how
far
the
state
can
go
in
protecting
it.
and,
the
district
court
below
said
that,
under
the
constitution,
the
state
can
only
protect
it
if
it
is
necessary
to
take
the
fetal
life
for
the
health
of
the
mother,
whereas
the
state
legislature
said
“no,
it’s
more
protectable
than
that”
and
where
our
regard
to
allow
abortions,
except
in
the
three
unusual
extreme
circumstances
which
we
set
out.
so,
the
district
court
was
not
making
a
judgment
based
on
constitution
but
a
value
judgment
once
it
had
already
accepted
the
proposition
that
there
was
protectable
human
life
involved
in
the
destruction
of
an
unborn
human
child.
so--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that’s
right.
i
think
it
is
a
matter
of
degree.
i
think
it’s
a
value
judgment
that
is
best
left
in
the
hands
of
the
legislature
to
determine
in
this
gray
area
of
prior
to
birth,
what
human
rights
are
there
prior
to
birth,
and
i
say
it
is
also
for
the
reason
that,
under
our
constitution,
we’ve
talked
a
lot
about
the
term
“person”
but
the
term
“person”
is
not
defined
in
the
constitution.
and,
as
we
said
earlier,
the
constitution
of
course
is
the
living
document
and,
today,
we
know
more
medically
and
under
science
with
respect
to
personhood
and
what
occurs
prior
to
birth
and
what
the
movement
is
and
at
what
stage
it’s
on,
what
a
person
is.
and,
i
think
that
the
state
has
an
interest
in
protecting,
as
far
as
it
can,
that
life
and
that’s
illustrated
by
this
criminal
abortion
law
that
georgia
has
in
the
context
of
its
many
statutes
which
protect
fetal
life
in
various
forms
and
the
decisions
of
its
courts
over
the
years
which
say
time
after
time
after
time.
beginning
with
that
at
least
the
1849
case,
we
are
going
to
consider
an
unborn
child
and
ventra
saunier
as
being
in
rerum
natura,
that
is
in
the
secular
world
where
it’s
in
its
own
interest
to
do
so,
so
that
it’s
part
of
georgia’s
whole
public
policy
to
protect
the
fetal
life
which
it
is
seeking
to
protect
in
this
instance.
now,
there
is
one
other
basis,
i
think,
or
at
least
two.
of
course,
it
wants
to
protect
the
health
of
the
mother
and
that’s
why
it
allows
these
exceptions,
at
least
the
exception
for
her
own
health
in
her
own
life
and
the
rape
exception
protects
her
mental
health.
but,
there
is
also
the
basis
that
the
state
wants
to
protect
not
only
health.
as
i
said,
primarily,
it
was
for
the
protection
of
the
fetal
life
and
also
for
the
general
welfare
to
protect
the
public
ethic,
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
suggested,
the
hippocratic
oath.
the
state
has
an
obligation
to
uphold
the
general
welfare
which
includes
how
a
government
protects
the
individuals
that
live
in
it,
and
i
would
suggest
that
this
is
an
emanation
of
that
or
a
manifestation
of
that
obligation
on
government
because
the
natural
right
which
an
unborn
fetus
has
to
continue
its
existence
without
being
disturbed,
it’s
right
to
be
let
alone
which
is
recognized
in
natural
law
and
has
been
recognized
in
the
common
law
under
blackstone
&
co.
and
those
authorities
which
were
accepted,
by
the
way,
by
the
georgia
courts,
they
didn’t
have
all
the
cases
necessarily
from
england
but
they
relied
on
blackstone
&
co.
as
shown
in
the
decisions
which
they
rendered.
so,
it
was
regarded
as
a
protectable
right
in
the
very
beginning
of
our
state’s
existence.
i
think
this
is
a
particularly
critical
area
where
what
mr.
justice
powell
said
in
chadwick
versus
tampa
very
recently
is
very
important.
he
said
that
our
federal
system
warrants
of
converting
desirable
practices
into
constitutional
commandment,
and
i
think
that’s
what’s
being
asked
for
here.
i
think
that’s
what
mary
doe
is
asking
for.
for
her
desire
or
a
desirable
practice
getting
into
all
the
health
significances
of
infant
mortality
or
maternal
mortality,
that
may
be
desirable,
but
let’s
not
turn
it
into
a
constitutional
commandment
because
it
isn’t
there.
if
there’s
anything
emanating
from
the
ninth
amendment,
it’s
the
fetus’
right
to
be
left
alone
and
his
own
self-preservation
which
is
the
ultimate
responsibility
of
government
to
protect.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
indeed.
i
think
there
is
that
right,
plus
other
rights
or
other
interests
which
the
state
has
to
see
that
it
is
let
alone
from
undue
destruction.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
not
at
all.
of
course
she
has
her
own
rights
too
to
her
own
privacy
but,
here,
another
entity
becomes
involved.
thank
you.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that
is
correct
because
it
has
powers
of--
under
its
police
powers
to
pass
statutes
to
protect
other
interests
which
aren’t
necessarily
constitutional
rights.
i
don’t
think
your
necessarily
balancing
two
constitutional
rights
here
at
all
and,
certainly,
despite
what
mrs.
weddington
said,
there
are
constitutional
rights
abridged
by
compelling
state
interests
which
are
other
than
the
protection
of
other
constitutional
rights
in
many
regards:
public
welfare,
those
type
of
things,
or
health.
it
may
not
be
a
constitutional
right
to
health
in
that
instance.
thank
you.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
very
knot
of
the
argument
before
this
court
and
the
issue
facing
this
court
is
the
value
which
is
to
be
placed
on
fetal
life.
the
state
in
this
case
takes
the
position
that
fetal
life
is
to
be
protected,
that
it
is
a
protectable
interest.
the
question
is
whether
there
should
be
no
value
placed
on
it
so
that
a
woman
may,
in
her
own
decision
and
with
her
own
doctor
determine
without
any
intervention
by
the
state
that
she
may
abort
a
pregnancy
after
she
has
conceived
and
is
carrying
a
live
human
fetus.
or
rather
on
the
other
hand,
the
state
itself
may
protect
the
interest
of
that
fetus
in
any
regard.
the
court
below
determines
that
the
state
interest
or
the
state
was
attempting
to
go
too
far
in
protecting
the
fetal
life.
but
that
it
could
protect
to
some
degree
because
it
could
prohibit
those
abortions
which
were
not
necessary
in
the
best
critical
judgment
of
the
physician
taking
into
consideration
that
not
only
medical
factors
but
really
everything
involved
in
the
particular
case.
the
woman’s
economic
position,
her
family
physician,
and
so
on.
but
at
any
rate,
the
court
did
indicate
that
the
state
had
an
interest
in
protecting
fetal
life
at
least
to
that
extent.
now,
if
the
court
of
course
said
well,
you
can
have
an
abortion
in
any
event
whether
it
is
necessary
or
not
then
of
course
it
would
be
consistent
with
the
argument
that
is
made
by
the
appellants.
however,
they
said
the
state
does
have
an
opportunity
to
control
those
abortions
which
are
not
necessary.
they
may
prohibit
them,
period.
i
think
a
great
mistake
has
been
made
by
that
court
and
by
appellants
in
saying
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
single.
that
is
there
is
only
a
help
measure.
in
the
first
place
it
is
in
the
criminal
code.
as
a
separate
bill,
it
was
introduced
to
amend
a
part
of
the
criminal
code.
the
original
bill
or
the
original
statute
in
1876
was
a
criminal
action.
and
it
speaks
of
the
unborn
child.
it
does
not
speak
of
a
thing
or
an
organism
but
it
speaks
of
protecting
the
unborn
child
and
that
is
at
least
one
of
the
interests
of
the
state
in
the
statute.
i
submit
that
there
are
three,
if
you
read
the
whole
statute
in
its
entirety.
number
one
and
the
underlying
reason
is
the
protection
of
fetal
life
from
wanting
or
arbitrary
destruction
simply
upon
the
convenience
or
the
desire
of
the
woman
who
is
bearing
it.
secondly,
of
course
the
state
is
interested
in
protecting
women
who
are
going
to
undergo
a
very
serious
procedure
at
any
stage
and
that
is
the
abortion
procedure
and
that
of
course
is
indicated
by
the
very
serious
procedure
that
is
set
out
by
not
only
having
her
own
physician
think
that
she
could
have
one
but
in
getting
consultants
and
also
approved
by
the
hospital
abortion
committee
and
requirement
to
be
done
in
the
hospital
which
by
the
way
has
certainly
been
the
position
of
the
american
life
association
and
house
of
delegates
in
1967
which
was
just
one
year
prior
to
the
time
this
statute
was
enacted
and
has,
in
my
understanding
at
least,
been
in
the
position
of
the
american
college
of
obstetricians
and
gynecologists
in
their
standards
and
in
their
latest
standard
with
regard
to
abortions
as
i
read
it
and
of
course
this
is
not
before
the
court.
and
i
just
make
them
aside
for
a
moment
to
say
that
that
is
one
of
the
troubles
with
this
case.
it
is
facial
attack
on
the
constitutionality
statute
and
all
the
statistics
and
what
the
doctors
think
on
one
side
or
on
the
other
and
whether
the
abortions
are
safer
than
child
birth
and
so
on
are
not
really
before
any
court
because
they
were
not
introduced
into
evidence
in
the
court
below.
so
they
are
not
part
of
the
record.
now
certainly
the
appellants
tried
to
present
evidence
and
in
the
only
hearing
that
was
held
before
the
lower
court
which
nearly
lasted
about
two
hours
at
the
most,
there
was
an
argument
but
both
sides
came
prepared
to
present
evidence
and
of
course
in
order
to
attack
the
constitutionality
as
to
its
effect
or
its
operation
in
georgia
or
its
applicability,
i
submit
that
we
would
need
a
fuller
record
and
that
is
an
attack
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
it
cannot
be
supported
without
looking
at
these
further
facts
unless
we
can
say
that
the
state
has
no
interest
whatsoever
in
protecting
fetal
life.
and
i
think
that
the
interest
which
the
fetus
has
as
human
fetus
in
this
instance
becomes
broader
as
time
goes
on.
i
think
the
state
has
a
greater
obligation
to
protect
that
fetal
life
today
than
it
did
in
1876.
and
for
this
reason,
it
is
more
protectable
now
than
it
ever
was
before.
there
are
more
methods
now
that
can
be
used
to
protect
them
including
blood
transfusion
and
surgery
while
it
is
still
in
the
womb.
now
this
i
think
has
been
brought
to
the
court’s
attention
in
some
degree
that
has
filed
by
the
physician.
but
at
any
rate
there
are
more
possible
ways
now
for
example,
the
very
growth
of
the
science
of
fetology
which
is
of
course
the
treatment
of
the
fetus
before
it
is
born.
so,
its
development,
it
has
been
created
and
its
development
up
to
the
period
of
birth
is
such
now
than
it
can
be
protected
by
the
state
and
so
i
think
there
is
a
greater
duty
upon
the
state
to
do
so.
now
the
question
which
i
think
comes
here
with
regard
to
these
exceptions
is
the
balancing
of
competing
interests.
the
state
certainly
takes
no
position
that
the
woman
has
a
constitutional
right
to
abortion.
we
have
not
been
shown
where
that
right
emanates
from.
if
it
emanates
from
the
considerations
which
was
given
in
the
griswold
case,
i
think
it
is
erroneous
because
in
that
case,
there
was
not
the
introduction
of
another
entity.
a
person
has
a
right
to
be
let
alone,
certainly.
but
not
when
another
person
is
involved
or
another
per
human
entity
is
involved.
the
same
thing
with
the
marriage
relationship,
here
a
third
entity
is
involved
and
the
state
says
you
may
not
indiscriminately
dispose
off
or
discontinue
the
life
of
that
third
entity
except
in
various
special
circumstances.
now
this
is
where
we
get
to
the
competing
interest
and
the
balancing
of
the
interest
which
by
the
way
think
was
a
statement
in
recognition
that
former
mr.
justice
clark
made
in
his
law
review
article
about
the
state
being
in
the
position
to
balance
imputing
interests.
i
would
say
if
you
have
a
fetus
growing
in
the
woman
on
one
side
and
a
woman
that
she
does
not
want
it,
you
got
a
class
of
interest
there.
now,
the
state
has
taken
a
position
where
we
are
not
going
to
prohibit
all
abortions
because
we
understand
that
there
are
circumstances
in
which
a
woman
should
be
able
to
destroy
that
fetus
because
her
interest
is
superior.
and
there
are
three
broad
reasons
now
that
are
given
in
our
statute
of
course
which
was
struck
out
by
the
court
below
so
that
we
cannot
here
really
argue
those
although
we
attempted
to
bring
an
appeal
here
which
was
denied
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
and
our
appeal
is
awaiting,
its
further
pursuit
in
the
fifth
circuit.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
thank
you
very
much.
underlying
the
exceptions
or
the
reasons
for
the
exception
in
the
statute
is
the
broad
principle
of
self-preservation.
we
recognize
that
a
human
being
has
a
right
ultimately
of
self-defense
and
i
think
that
these
exceptions
are
manifestations
of
that.
we
allow
a
woman
to
abort
a
fetus,
if
it
is
a
product
of
rape.
now
that
has
been
construed
in
our
state,
it
will
also
include
incest.
this
is
the
product
of
course
in
that
situation
of
an
unwarranted,
uninvited
attack
on
her.
and
to
require
her
to
bear
that
child
is
almost
a
punishment
or
at
least
she
would
often
require
regard
it
as
a
punishment
so
here
she
can
defend
herself
from
that
fetus
by
destroying
it.
secondly,
as
far
as
the
fetus
which
is
gravely
malformed
and
will
be
permanently
malformed
or
deficient,
the
state
recognizes,
i
think
the
very
practical
exception
because
it
recognizes
that
in
most
cases,
she
is
the
one
who
is
going
to
have
to
raise
that
child
and
the
state
is
not
now
in
a
position
where
it
can
automatically
taking
all
of
these
children
and
of
course
it
would
be
a
great
deal
of
heart
break
to
her
and
so
it
would
involve
her
own
well-being
and
the
state
says,
in
these
circumstances,
science
is
not
enough
developed
so
that
we
can
correct
these
deformities.
the
state
cannot
help
enough
in
these
circumstances
and
therefore
we
regard
it
as
an
exception
and
allow
you
to
defend
yourself
against
the
circumstances
which
will
arise
if
you
have
to
bear
and
keep
this
child.
the
third
one
of
course
is
the
preservation
of
her
own
life
or
her
own
health.
and
of
course
it
has
been
construed
not
judicially
but
as
a
matter
of
factors
that
help
here
includes
mental
health.
now
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
i
did
and
i
say
this
only
from
an
observation
of
the
reports
that
has
been
collected
by
the
georgia
department
public
health
to
whom
all
abortions
of
course
are
reported.
that
again
is
not
in
the
record
because
there
was
no
evidence
presented.
however,
particularly
since
the
period
of
the
court
decision.
the
reasons
that
are
reported
in
by
the
physicians
that
are
performing
abortions,
have
been
expanded
so
that
not
only
have
you
got
rape
and
incest
separate
and
not
only
do
we
have
for
mental
problems
or
physical
problems
so
that
a
maternal
--you
also
have
economic
and
social
now
being
given
as
a
separate
category
and
reason.
so
that
brings
me
to
the
point
that
an
injunction
is
not
needed
also.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that
is
right
but
no
one
has
brought
the
matter
to
the
attention
of
the
georgia
courts
and
i
would
dispute.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
as
far
as
the
social
and
economic
things
are
concerned.
i
think
your
question
as
to
the
rape
or
incest
as
suggested
before,
i
am
not
certain
of
that
but
i
think
it
would
because
the
court
decision
would
make
no
distinction
or
broaden
it
necessarily.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that
is
correct
but
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
clearly.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
indeed,
it
has
happened
since
then
and
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
very
reasons
why
no
injunction
would
be
necessary.
in
the
first
place,
the
parties
against
the
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
until
it
has
changed,
otherwise
but
if
the
state
of
course
takes
position
that
the
statute
is
constitutional
as
it
was
written.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
if
the
judgment
below
were
to
be
affirmed,
certainly,
there
is
no
indication
that
the
state
and
the
district
attorneys
and
the
hospital
abortion
committees
would
not
follow
the
mandate
of
this
court
as
has
been
done.
no
prosecutions
have
been
brought
despite
the
fact
of
the
reporting
of
these
other
extra
statutory
abortions.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
indeed.
and
so
there
would
be
no
purpose
for
an
injunction
because
it
is
being
abate
of
a
declaratory
judgment.
moreover,
an
injunction
against
anyone
of
the
defending
parties
would
really
lead
nowhere
because
the
attorney
general
of
course
does
not
want
to
bring
prosecutions
in
the
first
place
and
has
no
connection
whatsoever
with
the
hospital
abortion
committee
despite
what
the
court
below
believed.
another
suit
as
a
matter
of
fact
was
instituted
last
year
against
the
fulton
and
dekalb
hospital
authority,
a
body
of
politic
and
corporate
doing
business
with
grady
memorial
hospital.
and
that
is
where
you
get
the
abortion
committee
in
the
hospital.
and
the
attorney
general
has
not
idea
what
the
abortion
committee
in
this
particular
case
did
or
how
much
it
knew
and
that
again
is
one
of
the
great
problems
with
this
case.
we
now
no
facts.
there
are
no
facts
in
this
case.
no
established
facts.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
the
court
apparently
believed
that
it
was
not
necessary
because
they
were
going
to
consider
as
a
facial
attack
only.
and
i
think
the
court
made
a
mistake
in
that
circumstance.
i
think
they
have
confused
these
two
things.
one,
whether
you
need
facts
to
establish
a
justiciable
controversy
and
two,
whether
you
need
facts
and
a
concrete
circumstance
in
order
to
decide
facial
unconstitutionality.
and
i
think
they
jumped
to
the
second
situation
and
said
well,
we
are
going
to
just
look
at
the
statute
anyway
and
so
the
facts
do
not
matter.
and
i
would
submit
that,
that
is
a
wrong
circumstance
even
the
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
say
there
was
not.
there
was
not
a
case
of
controversy.
the
attorney
general,
the
district
attorney
of
fulton
county,
and
the
chief
of
police
of
the
city
of
atlanta
had
no
case
or
controversy
whatsoever
with
mary
doe
or
any
of
the
doctors
or
nurses
or
organizations
or
ministers
or
counselors.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
think
the
controversy
is
with
the,
whoever
the
denied
the
abortion.
that
is
it
may
have
been
the
committee.
i
think
that
that
will
have
to
–-
they
will
have
to
an
important
party.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
think
you
would
indeed
have
a
case
of
controversy
there.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no
sir,
not
with
the
attorney
general,
with
those
who
were
implementing
the
law.
the
attorney
general
would
be
interested
and
would
undoubtedly
as
required
by
law.
he
would
file
a
brief.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
and
that
is
not
the
attorney
general.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
it
would
be
the
district
attorney.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
he
is
one
of
the
appellees
mr.
justice.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that
is
indeed
correct.
of
course
the
chief
of
police
would
not
bring
a
prosecution
and
there
were
no
prosecutions
or
threats.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
you
may
but
there
was
not
enforcement
during
which
was
threatened
or
impending.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
but
we
do
not
know
that
it
was
pursuant
to
the
law.
you
are
assuming
i
believe
another
circumstance
that
there
was
compliance
with
the
law.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
it
alleged
that
that
was
the
reason
but
again
they
also
stated
that
they
did
not
know
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
am
sorry
i
did
not
hear
your
question.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no
sir,
i
think
it
must
appear
in
the
–-
as
the
case
proceeds.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
think
there
are
not
enough
facts
there.
no.
no
case
of
controversy.
not
with
these
defendants.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
thank
you.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
we
were
seeking,
i
think
when
we
started
our
case
of
controversy
and
i
think
that
is
very
clear
that
a
case
of
controversy
would
exist
with
a
hospital
of
abortion
committee
and
all
the
constitutional
questions
which
are
sought
to
be
raised
and
argued
in
this
case
could
be
brought
there.
i
think
also
that
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that
is
correct
if
there
were
a
threat.
but
here
we
have
enough
case
of
controversy
and
a
threat
of
course,
would
involved
the
anti-injunction
statute
i
think
rather
than
whether
it
could
by
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
a
threat
might.
if
the
proper
price
were
involved
but
here
for
example
we
do
not
have
as
far
as
we
know
we
do
not
have
mary
doe’s
doctor.
someone
who
was
taking
any
action
and
even
in
the
cases
which
the
court
recently
has
considered
about
the
facial
constitutionality
for
some
criminal
statutes,
there
was
an
actual
case
of
controversy
or
not
even
with
regard
to
the
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
do
not
know.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no
sir.
we
know
no
facts
about
her
at
all.
we
assume
that
since
there
is
an
affidavit
concerning
it
that
those
facts
may
very
well
be
true
but
we
have
had
no
opportunity
to
see
whether
there
are
other
facts.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that
is
correct.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
the
court
below
accepted
as
far
as
i
know
the
statements
that
were
made
in
allegation
as
being
true.
so
that
no
proof
was
submitted,
no
interrogatories
were
answered.
we
had
no
opportunity
to
find
out.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
through
counsel.
that
is
correct.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that
is
what
counsel
informs
us
as
correct.
she
was
not
pointed
out.
she
did
not
stand
up
in
court
for
example
and
indicate
herself
to
the
court
but
we
just
understand
that
she
was
there,
we
do
not
know
who
she
was.
there
was
a
courtroom
full
of
people.
so
we
could
not
follow
up
to
see
it
in
any
way.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
pardon.
i
am
sorry.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
if
her
allegations
are
accepted?
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
because
it
was
not
a
complete
divulgence
of
the
facts
surrounding
her
circumstance.
for
example,
we
do
not
know
that
the
hospital
abortion
committee
knew
as
much
about
her
as
in
her
allegations.
we
do
not
know
the
real
reason
for
which
they
denied
her
of
the
abortion.
particularly
since
she
was
assertedly
granted
the
approval
of
another
hospital
abortion
committee
which
again
makes
her
situation
somewhat
moot
because
she
did
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no
sir,
mr.
justice
douglas,
we
think
that
the
statute
itself
in
total
does
not
render
any
lack
of
due
process
or
equal
protection
on
its
face
to
any
of
these
plaintiffs
or
anyone
else.
we
think
that
the
statute
is
a
constitutional
one
as
of
writ
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
if
this
court
decides
that
the
restrictions
that
were
made
on
the
statute
are
correct
and
a
declaratory
judgment
should
issue,
we
would
think
that
would
indeed
be
proper
and
that
an
injunction
would
not
be
necessary.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
we
think
not
because
we
find
no
necessity
and
of
course
injunction
is
extraordinary
legal
relief.
injunction
against
anyone
of
these
appellees
would
do
nothing
as
far
as
the
enforcement
that
is
not
already
being
done
as
far
as
the
statute
is
concerned.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
there
may
be
situation
in
which
an
injunction
would
be
appropriate
but
not
in
this
circumstance
where
there
is
no
–-
well,
if
the
court
considers
that
there
is
a
case
of
controversy
there
still
would
not
be
a
need
for
an
injunction.
of
course
injunction
being
a
discretionary
type
of
thing
and
the
court
below
finding
no
necessity
for
one,
we
think
that
was
a
correct
finding
by
the
court
and
so
there
should
be
no
necessity
for
this
court
to
direct
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes
sir.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes
sir
if
it
became
necessary.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
indeed.
i
think
that
there
would
be
a
continuing
opportunity
to
do
so.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no
sir.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no
mr.
justice
stewart,
there
were
nothing
at
all
as
far
as
those
are
concerned.
not
even
a
threat.
and
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
makes
it
so
different
from
the
wisconsin
versus
constantineau
case
where
there
was
something
actually
done.
it
was
conduct
there
taken
on
behalf
of
the
officials
of
the
state
in
that
case
the
chief
of
police,
i
believe
it
was,
which
we
do
not
have
here
at
all.
i
would
like
to
point
out
one
other
thing
though.
we
were
mentioning
to
the
court
the
purposes
of
the
statute.
i
think
one
of
the
other
purposes
of
it.
i
think
there
are
primarily
three
being
to
protect
fetal
life
and
of
course
the
health
of
the
mother
and
having
to
go
through
this
procedure
and
also
to
protect
doctors
who
are
going
to
perform
therapeutic
abortions.
the
procedure
is
set
out
and
they
are
protected.
and
if
they
stay
within
those
wide
protections
that
are
given
in
statutes.
the
procedure
that
is
given
and
the
district
attorney
has
no
basis
on
which
to
refer
an
indictment
against
them
and
of
course
the
burden
would
be
on
him
to
show
that
the
abortion
was
not
necessary.
so
i
think
the
statute
is
also
to
protect
the
doctors
so
that
they
can
operate
with
regard
to
therapeutic
abortions.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that
is
correct.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no,
it
is
not.
not
that
i
know
of.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
because
abortions
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that
is
right.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
one
other
point
i
would
like
to
make
and
that
is
this.
in
another
area,
the
state
does
recognize
fetal
life
as
being
human
life
and
that
but
that
is
with
regard
to
fetal
death
certificates
which
are
required
to
be
filed
when
there
is
a
fetal
death.
and
that
portion
of
the
statute
which
deals
with
(inaudible)
arrangements
and
so
on
and
vital
records,
the
distinction
is
made
between
life,
birth,
and
fetal
death.
life,
birth
is
regarded
as
situation
where
a
product
of
conception
that
whatever
stage
it
occurs
is
expelled
or
extracted
from
a
mother’s
womb
and
there
is
evidence
of
life
which
means
–-
and
some
examples
are
given
in
the
statute;
voluntary
muscle
movement
or
heartbeat
or
something
that
indicates
breathing
or
movement.
sone
independent
activity
in
that
fetal
life
and
that
is
regarded
as
a
life
birth.
a
fetal
death
is
regarded
as
that
type
of
extraction
where
there
is
no
evidence
of
life.
so
i
think
in
that
instance
too,
the
state
carries
forward
this
consistent
concept
and
attitude
towards
pre-birth
children
and
that
they
are
indeed
human
life
that
needs
to
be
recorded
and
that
should
be
very
carefully
watched
before
there
is
any
destruction
of
it.
and
i
think
that
in
closing,
i
would
like
to
just
say
that
we
looked
at
a
criminal
defendant
and
say
before
he
is
going
to
be
condemned,
his
guilt
must
be
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
now,
we
look
that
at
an
unborn
child
and
say
can
we
now
at
least
limit
the
destruction
of
his
life
to
these
certain
circumstances
or
see
as
an
innocent
human
life
allowed
to
be
extinguished
without
any
regard
whatsoever.
thank
you.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
underlying
this
suit
is
an
appeal
by
pregnant
women
to
the
federal
judiciary
and,
particularly,
this
court
for
an
annunciation
that
they
have
a
right
secured
by
our
constitution
to
procure
the
destruction
of
their
living
unborn
children.
they
make
this
plea
because
the
people
of
the
state
of
georgia
forbid
abortion
except
in
certain
circumstances
which
the
people
of
the
state
through
our
legislature
believe
constitute
justifiable
homicide.
i
do
not
directly
represent
the
unborn
children
here,
nor
the
child
of
mary
doe
who
is
probably
now
two
years
old.
their
representation
by
a
guardian
at
litem
was
denied
by
the
court
below.
i
do,
however,
represent
three
state
and
local
officials
of
the
government
at
this
argument
and,
at
that
capacity,
i
do
represent
the
state
in
defending
the
statute
attacked.
the
state
is
parens
patriae
here,
exerting
the
power
of
guardianship
over
persons
on
a
disability
standing
as
it
were
in
local
parentis
or
in
place
of
the
parent.
here,
the
mother,
in
defending
the
unborn
child.
now,
before
we
get
into
whatever
issues
there
may
be
before
this
court,
with
respect
to
that
very
basic
fundamental
underlying
issue.
i
think
we
must
look
at
it
in
the
context
of
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
for
which
the
proposition
in
presented.
mary
doe
and
the
other
appellants,
whom
i
wish
to
prefer
to
as
plaintiffs
because
i
think
they
had
no
business
here
as
the
parents,
brought
this
action
under
section
12--
excuse
me,
1983.
this
is
a
1983
action
which
was
brought
in
the
federal
court
below
and
a
three-judge
court
was
requested.
that
action
which
gives
them
a
cause
or
a
right
of
our
claim
says
that
every
person
who
under
color
of
any
state
statute
subjects
or
cause
to
be
subjected
any
citizen
to
the
deprivation
of
any
rights
which
are
protected
by
the
constitution
has
a
cause
of
action.
so,
we
must
start
out
first
with
what
right
under
the
constitution
is
being
abridged
or
what
right
is
mary
doe
and
the
other
plaintiffs
alleging
exists.
the
burden
is
on
mary
doe
to
show
what
the
constitutional
right
is
in
the
first
place
before
she
has
a
course
of
action,
and
that
question
comes
before
this
court
because
this
court
has
not
yet
ruled
on
its
jurisdiction.
its
jurisdiction
depends
on
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court.
if
the
district
court
didn’t
have
jurisdiction
over
this
1983
case,
obviously
there
would
be
no
jurisdiction
in
this
court.
now,
to
begin
with,
since
she
must
show
what
this
right
is
and
the
burden
in
on
her,
this
court
could
decide
that
question
which
is
a
part
of
its
jurisdictional
question
because
if
there
was
no
constitutional
right
in
the
beginning,
then
the
district
court
had
no
business
looking
at
the
state
statute
and
measuring
it
against
that
constitutional
right.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that’s
right.
if
there
was
no
constitutional
right
in
the
first
place,
there’s
no
1983
action.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
indeed,
but
if
that
constitutional
right
is
lacking,
thyen
it
has
no
jurisdiction
to
go
any
further
because
then
there
is
no
deprivation
of
a
constitutional
right.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
not
at
all.
you
don’t
need
a
three-judge
court
to
decide
if
there’s
a
constitutional
right.
you
needed
a
three-judge
court
to
determine
if
there
should
be
an
injunction.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
you
probably
would
have
to
make
that
determination.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that’s
right,
and
that’s
why
the
question
is
ultimately
here
because
this
court
must
determine
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
below
so
that
we
say
that
all
these
arguments
and
all
these
statistics
with
regard
to
the
statute
itself
are
irrelevant
to
the
argument
here.
that
they
have
nothing
to
do
at
all
with
the
argument
here
because
mary
doe
and
the
other
plaintiffs
cannot
establish
the
constitutional
right
in
the
beginning
which
they
say
was
abridged
by
the
existence
of
the
statute.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
right,
exactly,
and
that’s
why
i
think
this
court
at
least--
excuse
me,
has
jurisdiction,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
to
determine
that
a
woman
does
not
have
a
right
secured
by
our
constitution
to
terminate
the
life
of
her
unborn
child
arbitrarily.
this
court
can
make
that
determination
in
this
suit
despite
all
the
other
lack
of
jurisdiction
of
the
court
below
with
regard
to
operation
of
the
statute
or
the
application
of
the
statute,
all
these
peripheral
issues.
now
the
burden,
as
i
said,
is
on
the
woman
who
is
exerting
this
so-called
right
to
establish
that
she
has
it.
that
it
is
secured
by
our
constitution,
but
i
still
admit
that
it
is
not.
there
is
no
such
right
and
for
several
reasons
that
i
think
are
very
fundamental.
abortion,
of
course,
is
the
killing
of
a
human
fetus
or
embryo.
the
victim
of
criminal
abortion
is
the
fetus,
not
the
mother.
the
victim
is
the
fetus.
so,
it’s
a
crime
recognized
by
the
state
against
the
unborn
child,
and
that
was
one
reason
why
i
brought
to
your
attention
that
little
booklet
established
by
the
state
in
1922
in
a
supplemental
authorities.
it’s
called
in
loco
parentis
and
it
was
published
by
the
state
welfare
department
and
it
has
to
do
with
all
the
statutes
of
the
state
and
the
decisions
of
the
state
protecting
children
and
under
the
catching
laws
protecting
children
are
crimes
against
children
and
that’s
where
abortion
is
discussed,
1922.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that’s
correct
and
that’s--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that
is
precisely
one
of
the
manifestations
of
the
state’s
interest
not
only
in
the
mother,
but
also
in
the
unborn
child.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
not
at
all,
but
there,
again,
the
great
distinction
is
that
there
is
not
another
entity--
human
entity
involved
which
there
is
here
and
that’s
the
source
of
the
protection
here.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
the
state--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
don’t
think
a
constitutional
basis
would
be
involved,
but
under
the
police
power
of
the
united--
of
the
state
to
protect
health
and
safety,
it
could
proscribe
tonsillectomies
at
least
so
that
it
was
related
to
health.
now,
if
it
might
be
overbroad
because,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
tonsillectomies
may
not
be
dangerous
and
may
be
a
health
measure,
but
that
has
little
to
do
with
the
purpose
of
the
state
in
prohibiting
abortion.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
because
that
would
be
a
health
measure
and
despite
what
the--
mary
doe
and
the
other
plaintiffs
or
appellants
say
here
and
despite
what
the
court
said
below,
the
purpose
of
this
abort--
criminal
abortion
statute
of
georgia
is
not--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
it
does
indeed.
it’s
a
very
direct
restriction
on
the
performance
of
such
operations.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
so--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
go
ahead,
mr.
justice
marshall.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that’s
right.
there
is
a
balancing
of
the
interests
which
we
have
talked
about
so
much.
under
the
19--
mary
doe
suggests
that
she
has
a
right
which
emanates
from--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes.
well
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
we
used
to
have
capital
punishment
statutes.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
not
a
commission
of
three
people.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
excuse
me,
not
as
to
whether
he
lives
or
dies.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
but
there
is--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no,
i’m
not
saying
that.
what
i’m
saying
is
this.
under
our
constitution,
obviously
as
mr.
justice
stewart
said,
a
person
that’s
born
has
all
the
protections
that
the
constitution
has
to
offer,
but
there
is
a
gray
area
where
we
don’t
know
when
life
as
such
begins
or
humanity
or
a
person
or
any
other
term
by
which
we
want
to
call
it.
obviously,
life
occurs
before
birth
because
there’s
movement
and
all--
medicine
recognizes
that.
so,
let’s
not
talk
about
life
then.
let’s
just
say
personhood
which,
of
course,
is
not
a
medical
term
at
all.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
there’s
a
gray
area
and
that
is
the
area
in
which
we
say
the
state
has
a
right
to
determine
by
its
legislature
how
far
it
will
go
in
protecting
that
because
it’s
a
matter
of
public
policy.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
indeed,
it
is
a
living
being
and
i
don’t
think
anybody
could
dispute
that.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
because
the
state
also
recognizes
the
competing
interest
of
self-preservation
that
the
mother
has
in
extreme
circumstances,
the
statute
doesn’t
allow--
the
exceptions
are
not
broad.
the
exceptions
are
very
narrow.
the
health
must
be
very
seriously
impaired.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
think
that’s
a
matter
of
terminology.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
of
course.
let’s
call
it
the
fetus
then.
the
state,
it
is
our
position,
has
a
right
in
this
gray
area
where
it
can’t
say
the
particular
moment
at
which
the
state
can
protect
human
beings
or
fetuses
or
whatever
area
on
the
continuum
of
life
that
you
want
to
talk
about,
but
there
is
a
right,
we
think,
that
a
human
being
has
which
emanates
from
the
ninth
amendment
itself
because
those
rights
are
retained
by
the
people
under
the
ninth
amendment,
and--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
if
you
recognize
both,
then
you
simply
would
have
to
justify
some--
find
some
common
medium
way
in
order
to
deal
with
both
conflicting
interests.
that’s
what’s
really
at
issue
here,
the
conflicting
interests
between
the
two,
but
under
the
common
law
and
under
natural
law,
according
to
blackstone
&
co.,
and
we
still
rely
on
those
despite
what
professor
means
may
say
and
i
cite
to
the
court
strongly
the
history
of
the
common
law
which
is
put
out
in
an
1865
book
which
we
cited
in
our
first
brief
as
storer
and
heard
book
describing
the
cases
before
any
statute
was
enacted
in
england
where
abortion
was
regarded
as
a
crime.
it
was
not
a
felony.
you’ve
asked
the
question
earlier
if
it
was
a
felony.
no,
it
was
a
misdemeanor
but,
regardless
of
whether
it
was
a
felony
or
misdemeanor
at
common
law,
it
was
regarded
as
a
misdemeanor
in
georgia
and
although
they
are
not
cases
before
the
statute
was
enacted
in
1865,
the
cases
around
that
time
including
the
1849
case
of
morrow
versus
scott
speak
of
the
unborn
child
as
having
any
right
which
a
state
was
able
to
give
it,
whatever
rights
were
protectable
insofar
as
it
was
protectable.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
i
apologize
for
so
late
providing
for
the
court
the
legislative
history
such
as
it
is
in
north
carolina
population
center
study
on
this
statute,
but
it
indicates
in
there
that
the
thought
was
that
rape
included
incest
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
statistics
which
are
kept
by
the
georgia
department
of
health
internal
health
section
classify
incest
separately
from
rape
and
indicate
that
prior
to
the
time
the
statute
was
emasculated
by
the
court
below,
abortions
were
being
performed
and
were
being
reported
and
were
not
being
prosecuted
under
the
title
incest
as
opposed
to
rape
so
that,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
has
secluded
that.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that’s
right.
there
were
two.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
sir.
thank
you
for
asking
about
them.
i
submitted
those
for
this
proposition
to
show
that
even
though
the
statute
had
been
passed
in
1968,
there
are
still
efforts
being
made
to
change
it
and
that,
despite
the
fact
that
after
the
district
court
changed
the
statute
and
really
wrote
its
own
statute
because
it
gave
an
entirely
different
purpose
to
the
statute
than
the
legislature
had,
efforts
were
made
and
they
were
still
knocked
down.
those
statutes
were
not
passed
because
they
were
too
liberal
with
respect
to
dealing
with
the
fetus.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no,
it
isn’t.
i
moved
very
likely
to
file
supplemental
authorities
and
i
simply
listed
them
because
i
felt
that,
as
shown
by
the
stack
in
front
of
you
mr.
justice
douglas,
there
were
so
many
briefs
that
it
would
be
superfluous
for
me
to
submit
another
supplemental
brief.
so,
i
simply
listed
the
authorities
so
that
i
might
be
able
to
talk
to
you
about
them
in
argument.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
it
might
be
under
a
health
measure,
a
policy
to
protect
health,
but
that’s
not
what’s
involved
here.
this
is
not
to
protect
the
health
of
the
person
who
wants
the
operation
which
is
what
you
would
have
in
the
open
heart
surgery.
legislation
to
protect
the
life
or
the
health,
and
the
police
power
comes
in
there
to
protect
the
life
of
the
one
who
wants
it
or
the
one
whose
doctor
thinks
they
already
have
it.
but,
that’s
not
the
purpose
of
the
georgia
abortion
statute.
it
is
not
health
related
or
health--
primarily
health
related.
that
is
not
its
primary
purpose
and
i
think
that
this
study
of
the
north
carolina
population
center
which,
by
the
way
in
the
very
preference
to
the
study,
says
that
the
reason
they
were
doing
it
was
to
assist
those
who
might
be
trying
to
get
more
liberal
abortion
legislation,
so
that
the
study
was
not
done
for
us
or
for
my--
our
stand
point
at
all,
but
it
shows
underlying
all
of
the
consideration
that
was
given
in
the
passage
of
this
bill
in
1968
which
was
proposed
actually
in
1967.
it
was
carried
over
and
there
were
public
hearings,
and
so
on.
the
underlying
assumption
and
basic
foundation
was
we
are
not
going
to
destroy
fetal
health
or
fetal
life
except
in
very
unusual
and
exceptional
extreme
circumstances.
the
basic
proposition
is
we
don’t
destroy
it,
and
i
submit
that
it’s
up
to
the--
up
to
mary
doe
to
show
that
there
is.
she
has
to
have
the
burden.
she
has
the
burden
of
showing
what
the
justification
is
because
it
is
a
natural
rate
under
an
order
of
things
emanating
from
the
ninth
amendment
to
be
let
alone,
and
that,
we
say,
is
what
the
right
which
the
fetus
has.
the
right
to
be
let
alone
and
not
to
be
stopped
in
its
growth
towards
birth
at
a
time
which
would
be
premature
and,
despite
the
fact
that
perhaps
now
as
we
look
at
all
the
authorities,
perhaps
when
the
statute
were
first
passed
and
ours
was
1876
or
1859
in
texas
then.
perhaps
the
original
purpose
was
to
protect
the
health
of
the
woman
from
aseptic
surgery,
but
purposes
evolve
and
change.
things
are
not
static.
our
constitution
is
not
static,
and
we
now
have
a
showing
by
the
study
which
is
done
by
north
carolina
and,
by
looking
at
the
statute
itself,
we
don’t
even
have
to
go
to
the
north
carolina
study,
but
looking
at
the
statute
itself
shows
that
the
purpose
has
evolved
to
protect
this
fetus
and,
as
an
illustration
of
that,
let
me
point
to
the
very
procedure
which
is
being
attacked
here.
the
procedure
involves
four
doctors
or
six.
there’s
some
question
about
whether
the
hospital
committee
can
include
the
two
consultants,
but
let’s
say
six.
they
are
not
required
by
the
statute
to
determine
whether
the
method
that’s
used
for
the
abortion
is
safe
or
not,
or
whether
the
woman
is
too
far
advanced
to
undergo
abortion.
all
they
are
required
to
do
under
the
statute
is
to
determine
whether
the
abortion
should
be
performed,
whether
it
comes
within
one
of
the
exceptions.
that’s
all.
they
don’t
make
a
medical
judgment
about
the
operation
itself.
what
they’re
concerned
about
is,
is
this
an
instance?
is
this
an
extreme
instance
in
which
we
should
allow
the
fetus
to
be
destroyed?
that’s
all,
and
that
shows
that
the
purpose
is
the
fetus’
protection.
look
also
at
the
exceptions,
the
three
exceptions.
if
it
were
that
the
purpose
of
the
exceptions
was
any
time
that
it
was
for
the
woman’s
desire
or
want,
it
would
deal
only
with
her
own
health,
but
the
exception
are
only
when
extreme
circumstances
of
self-preservation
or
self-defense
as
far
as
she’s
concerned,
not
things
that
have
to
do
with
her
health.
so,
i
think
the
statute
itself
shows
that
the
underlying
purpose
is
the
protection
of
fetal
life.
also,
i
think
that,
very
clearly,
the
part
that
was
struck
out
by
the
court
below
with
respect
to
the
action
which
was
a
statutory
action
to
be
brought
in
a
superior
court
for
the
trial
of
the
fetus’
underlying
constitutional
or
other
rights.
that
shows
clearly
that
the
legislature’s
purpose
was
to
protect
the
fetus
from
being
destroyed.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i’d
like
to
point
out
at
this
juncture
again,
with
respect
to
jurisdiction,
that
the
right
which
mary
doe
is
asserting
here
as
being
protected
by
the
constitution
is
really
not
the
right
that
she
asserts
in
her
brief,
and
i
say
that
for
this
reason.
she
doesn’t
disagree
with
the
court
below
and
the
statute
that
it
made.
although
it
found
the
basis
of
the
statute
or
the
purpose
of
the
statute
to
be
health
oriented,
it
said
the
state
has
some
interest
in
protecting
fetal
life.
the
state
does
have
an
interest
which
it
can
assert
by
statute
and,
therefore,
the
district
court-made
statute
recognized
from
the
very
beginning
that
there
was
something
protectable
by
the
state
prior
to
birth.
so,
i
say
that
mary
doe
is
beat
from
the
beginning
because
she
doesn’t
come
to
this
court
and
say
the
district
court’s
statute
is
overbroad,
but
she
only
says
that
it’s
vague.
so
that,
what
we
have
here
is
not
a
question
as
to
whether
a
woman
has
a
constitutional
right
to
abort
any
pregnancy,
but
whether
she
has
one
in
the
terms
that
the
district
court
outlined,
that
is
one
that
is
not
necessary
in
the
best
clinical
judgment
of
the
physician.
now,
i
say
that
supports
the
state’s
physician
because
that’s
a
recognition
by
the
court
below
that
there
is
protectable
fetal
life
and
that
it
becomes
a
matter
of
degree
how
far
the
state
can
go
in
protecting
it.
and,
the
district
court
below
said
that,
under
the
constitution,
the
state
can
only
protect
it
if
it
is
necessary
to
take
the
fetal
life
for
the
health
of
the
mother,
whereas
the
state
legislature
said
“no,
it’s
more
protectable
than
that”
and
where
our
regard
to
allow
abortions,
except
in
the
three
unusual
extreme
circumstances
which
we
set
out.
so,
the
district
court
was
not
making
a
judgment
based
on
constitution
but
a
value
judgment
once
it
had
already
accepted
the
proposition
that
there
was
protectable
human
life
involved
in
the
destruction
of
an
unborn
human
child.
so--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that’s
right.
i
think
it
is
a
matter
of
degree.
i
think
it’s
a
value
judgment
that
is
best
left
in
the
hands
of
the
legislature
to
determine
in
this
gray
area
of
prior
to
birth,
what
human
rights
are
there
prior
to
birth,
and
i
say
it
is
also
for
the
reason
that,
under
our
constitution,
we’ve
talked
a
lot
about
the
term
“person”
but
the
term
“person”
is
not
defined
in
the
constitution.
and,
as
we
said
earlier,
the
constitution
of
course
is
the
living
document
and,
today,
we
know
more
medically
and
under
science
with
respect
to
personhood
and
what
occurs
prior
to
birth
and
what
the
movement
is
and
at
what
stage
it’s
on,
what
a
person
is.
and,
i
think
that
the
state
has
an
interest
in
protecting,
as
far
as
it
can,
that
life
and
that’s
illustrated
by
this
criminal
abortion
law
that
georgia
has
in
the
context
of
its
many
statutes
which
protect
fetal
life
in
various
forms
and
the
decisions
of
its
courts
over
the
years
which
say
time
after
time
after
time.
beginning
with
that
at
least
the
1849
case,
we
are
going
to
consider
an
unborn
child
and
ventra
saunier
as
being
in
rerum
natura,
that
is
in
the
secular
world
where
it’s
in
its
own
interest
to
do
so,
so
that
it’s
part
of
georgia’s
whole
public
policy
to
protect
the
fetal
life
which
it
is
seeking
to
protect
in
this
instance.
now,
there
is
one
other
basis,
i
think,
or
at
least
two.
of
course,
it
wants
to
protect
the
health
of
the
mother
and
that’s
why
it
allows
these
exceptions,
at
least
the
exception
for
her
own
health
in
her
own
life
and
the
rape
exception
protects
her
mental
health.
but,
there
is
also
the
basis
that
the
state
wants
to
protect
not
only
health.
as
i
said,
primarily,
it
was
for
the
protection
of
the
fetal
life
and
also
for
the
general
welfare
to
protect
the
public
ethic,
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
suggested,
the
hippocratic
oath.
the
state
has
an
obligation
to
uphold
the
general
welfare
which
includes
how
a
government
protects
the
individuals
that
live
in
it,
and
i
would
suggest
that
this
is
an
emanation
of
that
or
a
manifestation
of
that
obligation
on
government
because
the
natural
right
which
an
unborn
fetus
has
to
continue
its
existence
without
being
disturbed,
it’s
right
to
be
let
alone
which
is
recognized
in
natural
law
and
has
been
recognized
in
the
common
law
under
blackstone
&
co.
and
those
authorities
which
were
accepted,
by
the
way,
by
the
georgia
courts,
they
didn’t
have
all
the
cases
necessarily
from
england
but
they
relied
on
blackstone
&
co.
as
shown
in
the
decisions
which
they
rendered.
so,
it
was
regarded
as
a
protectable
right
in
the
very
beginning
of
our
state’s
existence.
i
think
this
is
a
particularly
critical
area
where
what
mr.
justice
powell
said
in
chadwick
versus
tampa
very
recently
is
very
important.
he
said
that
our
federal
system
warrants
of
converting
desirable
practices
into
constitutional
commandment,
and
i
think
that’s
what’s
being
asked
for
here.
i
think
that’s
what
mary
doe
is
asking
for.
for
her
desire
or
a
desirable
practice
getting
into
all
the
health
significances
of
infant
mortality
or
maternal
mortality,
that
may
be
desirable,
but
let’s
not
turn
it
into
a
constitutional
commandment
because
it
isn’t
there.
if
there’s
anything
emanating
from
the
ninth
amendment,
it’s
the
fetus’
right
to
be
left
alone
and
his
own
self-preservation
which
is
the
ultimate
responsibility
of
government
to
protect.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
indeed.
i
think
there
is
that
right,
plus
other
rights
or
other
interests
which
the
state
has
to
see
that
it
is
let
alone
from
undue
destruction.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
not
at
all.
of
course
she
has
her
own
rights
too
to
her
own
privacy
but,
here,
another
entity
becomes
involved.
thank
you.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that
is
correct
because
it
has
powers
of--
under
its
police
powers
to
pass
statutes
to
protect
other
interests
which
aren’t
necessarily
constitutional
rights.
i
don’t
think
your
necessarily
balancing
two
constitutional
rights
here
at
all
and,
certainly,
despite
what
mrs.
weddington
said,
there
are
constitutional
rights
abridged
by
compelling
state
interests
which
are
other
than
the
protection
of
other
constitutional
rights
in
many
regards:
public
welfare,
those
type
of
things,
or
health.
it
may
not
be
a
constitutional
right
to
health
in
that
instance.
thank
you.
