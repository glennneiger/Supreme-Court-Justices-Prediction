unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
these
are
class
actions
too?
unknown
speaker
would
she
be
guilty
of
a
conspiracy
to
perform
that
abortion?
unknown
speaker
mrs.
hames,
the
hospital
here
was
not
named
as
a
defendant,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
any
reason
for
that?
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
real
mary
doe
or
is
it?
unknown
speaker
under
this
statute
though,
does
the
fetus
have
collective
right?
may
that
be
afforded?
unknown
speaker
without
more,
whether
or
not
involving
health
of
the
mother?
unknown
speaker
that
is
by
specific
provision
i
gather?
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
assume
that?
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
disclose
that
it
is
medically
established
that
pregnancy
tests
are
not
very
accurate
until
after
six
weeks?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
asking
if
it
is
an
established
medical
fact.
unknown
speaker
again,
has
it
not
been
followed
through
years
in
accredited
hospital?
unknown
speaker
as
i
understood,
you
are
arguing
this
as
being
unduly
cumbersome
and
the
response
is,
is
it
not
the
fact
that
this
has
been
a
routine
in
accredited
hospitals
all
over
the
countries
for
many,
many
years?
unknown
speaker
unless
that
that
argument
would
be
true
about
the
maintenance
of
professional
standards
generally
in
the
medical
profession
would
it
not?
disciplinary
proceedings
and
everything
else?
is
there
a
way
those
who
pass
upon
malpractice
or
the
lack
of
professional
confidence
or
ethical
judgment
on
the
part
of
doctors
are
his
competitors?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
those
counties
have
no
hospitals
at
all?
unknown
speaker
but
is
it
not
possible
that
some
of
these
counties
to
which
you
refer
do
not
have
hospitals
at
all?
unknown
speaker
well
if
that
is
alright
in
georgia
with
the
large
number
of
counties
you
have,
i
think
you
have
more
counties
than
others
do,
do
you
not?
unknown
speaker
you
are
far
better
developed
than
many
other
states.
i
just
question
your
general
statement
about
the
denial
of
relief?
unknown
speaker
this
georgia
legislation
is
relatively
recently?
unknown
speaker
may
i
declare,
that
the
relief
that
you
are
asking,
you
have
got
a
declaratory
judgment
bearing
some
provisions
to
declare
the
statute
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
you
are
asking
a
declaratory
judgment
declaring
the
entire
statute
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
and
then
you
want
us
to?
unknown
speaker
and
then
you
want
us
to
order
and
issue
and
injunction
against
all
future
enforcement
statute?
unknown
speaker
yes.
and
as
i
understand
it,
you
are
arguing
the
constitutional
rights
of
mary
doe
and
the
physicians
here?
unknown
speaker
am
i
correct
in
not
detecting
any
constitutional
argument
on
behalf
of
your
other
plaintiffs,
your
registered
nurses,
your
counselors
and
the
rest?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
this
may
be
needed,
but
are
you
making
a
constitutional
argument
on
behalf
of
the
nurses,
counselors,
and
ministers
and
what
have
you?
unknown
speaker
well
do
i
detect
that
you
are
not
making
an
constitutional
argument
with
respect
to
that?
it
is
only
a
need
for
declaratory
relief,
is
that
not
a
state
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
still
do
not
whether
you
are
making
a
constitutional
argument?
unknown
speaker
with
respect
to
all?
unknown
speaker
where,
i
did
not
get
that
in
your
brief.
i
will
be
glad
if
you
straighten
that
out.
unknown
speaker
no.
do
i
understand
it
correctly
that
no
hospital
abortion
committee
has
said
we
are
denying
this
because
we
are
not
going
to
follow
the
district
court
judgment
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
and
you
said
a
24
appellate
decision
13
involved
doctor?
unknown
speaker
what
did
the
other
13
involved?
unknown
speaker
the
other
11?
unknown
speaker
non-physician?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
well,
mrs.
beasley,
i
do
not
see
why
you
cannot
argue
that
here.
your
position
is
that
the
court
was
right
in
not
issuing
an
injunction
and
you
can
support
that
position
by
the
arguments
you
want.
you
are
the
appellee,
you
are
not
the
appellant.
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
that
the
first
one
you
mentioned,
which
was
the
third
one
under
the
statute,
pregnancy
resulting
from
forcible
statutory
rape
also
include
by
construction
includes
pregnancy
resulting
from
incest?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
it
incidentally,
i
gather
that
the
court
has
said
that
is
the
correct
interpretation
of
this
statue?
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
this
has
happened
since
this
court’s
decision
though,
do
you
not?
that
is
it,
so
it
is
the
effect
of
he
decision,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
statute
does
not
mention
incest.
unknown
speaker
clearly,
it
does
not
mention
economic
or
social
conditions
–-
unknown
speaker
--
and
now
if
abortions
are
taking
place
based
upon
those
extra
statutory
reasons,
i
would
suppose
that
this
has
began
to
happen
since
this
case
was
decided
by
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
it
have
to
say
the
court
to
the
extent
of
the
judgment
below,
affirmed
that
georgia
accepted
and
it
was
not
prosecuted
on
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
my
(inaudible)
was
that
the
judgment
below
were
to
be
affirmed?
unknown
speaker
my
assumption
is
relied
on
the
judgment
below
and
the
positions
i
gather
--
that
performing
abortions
and
relying
on
the
judgment
has
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
why
would
the
three-judge
court
did
not
commit
with
the
introduction
of
those?
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
there
is,
there
was,
or
was
there
a
case
of
controversy?
unknown
speaker
well,
let
us
say
a
person
alleges
that
she
is
pregnant
and
has
tried
to
get
an
abortion,
and
has
been
refused?
unknown
speaker
but
let
us
assume
that
their
refusal
to
abort
is
wholly
consistent
with
the
law?
and
that
the
refusal
was
precisely
what
the
law
required
them
to
do,
then
where
was
the
controversy?
unknown
speaker
with
the
attorney
general?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
doctor
refuses
an
abortion
because
he
is
afraid
of
criminal
prosecution,
i
supposed
one
effective
way
to
avoid
resolve
a
controversy
is
to
enjoin
the
person
who
might
prosecute.
unknown
speaker
then
who
is
it?
unknown
speaker
he
is
one
of
the
appellees
here?
unknown
speaker
it
is
the
same
thing
as
the
chief
of
police?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
but
is
there
not
a
case
that
a
woman
who
has
been
refused
of
abortion
and
because
a
doctor
is
afraid
of
being
prosecuted,
do
you
not
have
a
controversy
of
the
law
enforcement
officers
who
are
enforcing
the
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
here
with
conduct
pursuant
to
the
law
though
namely
refusal
of
an
abortion?
unknown
speaker
what
did
the
complaint
allege?
unknown
speaker
when
do
you
decide
defending,
after
a
trial
or
on
the
basis
of
complaint?
unknown
speaker
when
do
you
decide
defending
after
a
trial?
unknown
speaker
let
as
assume
the
facts
are
true
as
alleged
by
the
complaint,
a
case
of
controversy?
unknown
speaker
suppose
if
your
requirement
to
satisfy
and
show
the
threat
would
then
conclude
that
it
would
be
beyond
the
confidence
of
the
three-judge
court
and
the
decree.
unknown
speaker
well,
a
threat
to
make
it
a
case
upon
this?
unknown
speaker
well,
mary
doe
was
real?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
it
was
considered?
unknown
speaker
as
i
remember
your
colleague
on
the
other
side
answered
that
there
was
an
offer
of
proof
to
the
district
court
that
she
was
real.
and
that
he
said
that
was
not
necessary.
unknown
speaker
that
means
he
accepted
that
he
accept
the
fact
that
this
was
a
real
human
being.
unknown
speaker
but
it
was.
but
the
plaintiff
expressed
her
willingness
and
then
offered
just
to
show
this,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
she
was
in
the
courtroom?
unknown
speaker
but
once
it
is
accepted,
what
difference
does
it
make
to
the
case
if
any?
unknown
speaker
once
that
is
accepted
as
a
fact,
why
will
that
make
any
difference
to
the
case?
unknown
speaker
if
the
proffer,
the
court
said
that
the
proffer
proof
was
unnecessary
then
why
do
we
need
to
be
concerned
about
whether
she
is
a
fictitious
or
a
real
person?
unknown
speaker
if
you
should
boost
on
with
what
your
point
of
there
is
no
case
of
controversy.
you
can
see
that
the
remedy
given
was
proper?
unknown
speaker
so
you
lose
on
that,
you
think
the
remedy
given
was
improper?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
an
injunction
would
be
proper
in
light
of
1983?
unknown
speaker
if
you
would
construe
that
the
word
inequity
in
1983
is
allowing
injunction
in
some
case?
unknown
speaker
the
declaratory
decree
would
not
be
proper
under
1983?
unknown
speaker
and
that
of
course,
suppose
the
court
could
in
the
interest
of
effectuating
its
declaratory
judgment
and
of
some
later
time
issuing
an
injunction,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
if
there
were
indications
of
the
declaratory
judgment
were
not
being
otherwise
made
or
effectuated?
unknown
speaker
then
--
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
these
are
class
actions
too?
unknown
speaker
would
she
be
guilty
of
a
conspiracy
to
perform
that
abortion?
unknown
speaker
mrs.
hames,
the
hospital
here
was
not
named
as
a
defendant,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
any
reason
for
that?
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
real
mary
doe
or
is
it?
unknown
speaker
under
this
statute
though,
does
the
fetus
have
collective
right?
may
that
be
afforded?
unknown
speaker
without
more,
whether
or

of
the

unknown

that
is
by

does
the

does
the

have

than

do,
do

unknown

you
are

than

i
just
question
your
general
statement
about
the
denial
of

unknown
speaker
this
georgia

is
relatively

unknown

may
i

that
the
relief
that
you
are
asking,
you
have
got
a

i
do

show
the
threat
would
then
conclude
that
it
would
be
beyond
the
confidence
of
the
three-judge
court
and
the
decree.
unknown
speaker
well,
a
threat
to
make
it
a
case
upon
this?
unknown
speaker
well,
mary
doe
was
real?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
it
was
considered?
unknown
speaker
as
i
remember
your
colleague
on
the
other
side
answered
that
there
was
an
offer
of
proof
to
the
district
court
that
she
was
real.
and
that
he
said
that
was
not
necessary.
unknown
speaker
that
means
he
accepted
that
he
accept
the
fact
that
this
was
a
real
human
being.
unknown
speaker
but
it
was.
but
the
plaintiff
expressed
her
willingness
and
then
offered
just
to
show
this,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
she
was
in
the
courtroom?
unknown
speaker
but
once
it
is
accepted,
what
difference
does
it
make
to
the
case
if
any?
unknown
speaker
once
that
is
accepted
as
a
fact,
why
will
that
make
any
difference
to
the
case?
unknown
speaker
if
the
proffer,
the
court
said
that
the
proffer
proof
was
unnecessary
then
why
do
we
need
to
be
concerned
about
whether
she
is
a
fictitious
or
a
real
person?
unknown
speaker
if
you
should
boost
on
with
what
your
point
of
there
is
no
case
of
controversy.
you
can
see
that
the
remedy
given
was
proper?
unknown
speaker
so
you
lose
on
that,
you
think
the
remedy
given
was
improper?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
an
injunction
would
be
proper
in
light
of
1983?
unknown
speaker
if
you
would
construe
that
the
word
inequity
in
1983
is
allowing
injunction
in
some
case?
unknown
speaker
the
declaratory
decree
would
not
be
proper
under
1983?
unknown
speaker
and
that
of
course,
suppose
the
court
could
in
the
interest
of
effectuating
its
declaratory
judgment
and
of
some
later
time
issuing
an
injunction,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
if
there
were
indications
of
the
declaratory
judgment
were
not
being
otherwise
made
or
effectuated?
unknown
speaker
then
