mr.
mcclearn,
to
enable
me
to
get
this
into
focus,
has
there
been
any
attempt
by
the
petitioner
to
secure
his
rights
through
the
collective
bargaining
agent?
unknown
speaker
am
i
correct
in
my
impression
that
there
have
however,
been
attempts
of
this
kind
by
other
petitioners
in
the
same
predicament?
unknown
speaker
the
reason
i
asked
you
is
that
i
have
a
distinct
impression,
i
have
not
checked
it
but
we
have
litigation
of
this
kind
on
the
court
of
appeals
in
which
was
sent
before
brought
by
just
such
petitioners
against
all
the
system
board
or
the
brotherhoods
and
so
forth.
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
relief
sought?
unknown
speaker
there
is
--
i
see
--
because
i
was
wondering
because
it
appears
in
the
brief
that
mr.
love
voluntarily
resigned
from
his
employment
with
the
pullman
company
in
november
of
1968.
unknown
speaker
and
i
wanted,
if
by
any
chance
the
issues
in
this
case
become
moot
because
of
that?
unknown
speaker
and
the
back
pay?
unknown
speaker
when
they
referred
it
to
the
state,
when
they
did
refer
it
to
the
state,
the
state
came
back
and
said
we
do
not
want
anything
to
do
with
it.
now,
was
the
state
proceedings
terminated?
unknown
speaker
well,
now
let
us
assume
there
had
been
an
exchange
of
formal
letters,
we
refer
to
you
a
claim
that
colorado
says
we
do
not
anything
to
do
with
it,
would
that
have
been
an
adequate
going
to
the
state
--
unknown
speaker
mr.
eppich,
straighten
me
out
a
little
bit.
title
vii
of
the
’64
act
became
effective
on
july
2,
’65?
unknown
speaker
was
it
after
that
date
that
the
federal
commission
referred
or
made
a
reference
to
the
colorado
people?
unknown
speaker
the
government
brief
says
may
19,
’66.
would
you
say
that
this
is
not
a
proper
filing
with
the
state
commission
subsequent
to
the
adoption
of
title
vii.
unknown
speaker
but
was
not
that
more
than
an
oral
communication?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
love
however,
wrote
to
the
eeoc.
and
did
not
the
eeoc
refer
that
writing
to
the
colorado
commission?
unknown
speaker
what
does
it
do?
just
telephone?
unknown
speaker
firstly,
colorado
commission
knew
what
it
was
all
about.
they
had
it
before
--
unknown
speaker
it
just
began
back
in
1963
as
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
it
is
at
first
sentence,
that
it
has
come
to
my
attention
that
mr.
love
has
filed
a
complaint
against
the
pullman
companies
from
your
office,
that
you
say
evidence
is
that
something
got
from
the
state
of
colorado
in
writing
or
orally
or
not
it
does
not
say
just
for
a
comparison.
unknown
speaker
shows
irregularity
or
something?
unknown
speaker
that
is
one
jurisdiction
until
60
day
deferment
period.
unknown
speaker
even
if
it
was
orally
complained
and
written
was
required,
they
can
waive
written
and
take
it
off,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
so
it
is
really
is,
it
is
the
state’s
privilege
to
determine
how
much
jurisdiction
is
invoked?
