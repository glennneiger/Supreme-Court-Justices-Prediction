the
issue
before
this
court
involves
the
interpretation
of
section
706,
subtitle
7
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act.
this
section
of
the
statute
deals
with
the
mechanics
of
lodging
a
charge
of
discrimination
with
the
equal

opportunity
commission.
more
specifically
it
deals
with
the
mechanical
steps
that
one
must
take
to
lodge
such
a
charge
in
a
state
that
has
its
own
fair
employment
practices
acts,
and
colorado
does
have
such
an
act
which
makes
discrimination
at
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
on
the
basis
of
race
improper.
mr.
love
is
a
black
man.
his
complaint
in
the
district
court
was
that
he
had
been
discriminated
against
in
the
terms
and
conditions
of
his
employment
by
the
pullman
company
because
he
was
given
a
job
classification
of
“porter
in
charge”
where
he
performed
the
same
functions
as
were
performed
by
white
people
that
were
called
conductors.
and
yet
he
received
substantially
less
pay
for
doing
so.
he
alleges
that
the
only
basis
for
the
differentiation
was
race
and
that
this
constituted
a
violation
of
title
vii.
his
complaint
is
that
this
discrimination
was
perpetrated
against
him.
everyday
he
was
employed
by
the
pullman
company
because
of
the
continuing
existence
of
the
discriminatory
job
classification
and
pay
differential.
he
first
sought
relief
for
this
discriminatory
condition
in
1963
by
approaching
the
colorado
civil
rights
commission
and
of
course
at
that
time
there
was
no
1964
civil
rights
act.
the
records
of
that
context
are
lost.
however,
he
did
what
was
required
by
the
colorado
statute
to
initiate
a
complaint.
he
returned
to
the
colorado
civil
rights
commission
in
1965
and
verbally
reiterated
his
complaint.
the
colorado
civil
rights
commission
investigated
his
complaint
in
1965
and
they
discussed
the
matter
with
the
pullman
company.
but
the
only
relief
that
the
colorado
civil
rights
commission
offered
mr.
love
was
the
opportunity
to
be
reclassified
as
a
conductor.
but
if
he
were
to
do
that,
he
would
lose
all
of
the
job
seniority
and
it
would
have
actually
have
resulted
in
his
being
laid
off
and
being
put
out
of
work.
this
relief
was
offered
to
him
in
a
letter
from
the
colorado
civil
rights
commission
that
is
dated
july
30th
1965
and
to
which
he
did
not
respond.
instead,
in
may
19th
1966,
he
wrote
a
letter
directly
to
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
complaining
about
this
discriminatory
classification
and
pay
system.
and
that
letter
appears
to
have
been
received
by
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
on
may
23rd
1966.
the
colorado
civil
rights
commission
was
advised
by
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
that
mr.
love
had
lodged
a
complaint
with
it.
the
colorado
civil
rights
commission
responded
by
writing
a
letter
to
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
specifically
saying
that
they
did
not
want
to
investigate
mr.
love’s
complaint
waiving
the
60
day
deferment
period
provided
for
in
the
statute
and
--
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
the
60
day
period
could
have
run
from
i
suppose
either
the
time
when
they
received
the
complaint
or
at
the
time
that
they
were
advised
of
it
which
would
have
had
been
somewhere
between
may
23rd
and
the
1st
of
june
which
is
the
date
of
the
letter
from
the
colorado
civil
rights
commission
to
the
equal
employment
opportunity.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
the
statute
provides
that
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
can
do
nothing
for
60
days.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
the
term
of
the
statute
is
after
the
filing
of
the,
excuse
me
--
the
indication
is
that
the
eeoc
can
do
nothing
from
the
time
when
a
charge
initiated
with
the
state
agency,
and
the
last
section
of
section
--
the
last
sentence
in
section
706b
indicates
that
all
that
need
to
be
done
under
the
federal
statute
is
to
send
a
letter
to
the
state
statute.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
that
is
my
reference.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
it
would
indicate
whatever
is
sent.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
or
by
the
individual
complainant,
i
suppose.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
there
was
none.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
i
am
not
prepared,
in
this
case
or
in
related
case
generally?
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
well,
in
answer
to
that
question
i
think
there
has
been
litigation
in
the
norman
case
from
your
old
circuit
and
i
think
the
conclusion
reached
in
those
and
other
cases
has
been
that
that
is
not
an
exclusive
remedy
and
that
the
federal
rights
created
by
title
vii
of
the
’64
act
can
be
exercised
regardless
of
whether
or
not
an
attempt
is
made
to
seek
redress
under
collective
bargaining
agreements.
in
answer
to
your
specific
question
here,
in
this
case,
there
is
no
record
that
mr.
love
made
any
formal
attempt
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
that
he
was
working
under
as
a
porter.
well,
the
eeoc
after
having
been
told
by
the
colorado
commission
that
the
colorado
commission
did
not
want
to
proceed
went
forward
and
put
mr.
love’s
charge
on
an
official
form
which
was
sworn
to
on
july
23rd,
served
that
on
the
pullman
company
which
under
regulations
then
and
now
in
effect
had
the
right
at
that
time
to
respond
to
the
charge
of
discrimination
that
had
been
lodged
with
the
eeoc.
during
the
course
of
the
next
two
years,
the
eeoc
investigated,
found
probable
cause,
attempted
to
conciliate
and
being
unable
to
do
so,
on
may
28th,
1968,
mr.
love
filed
this
litigation.
six
months
thereafter,
on
december
3rd
1968,
the
pullman
company
moved
to
dismiss
and
it
is
that
motion
that
dismissed
which
was
granted.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
the
relief
sought
in
the
complaint
in
this
case
at
that
time
and
still
is
for
a
declaratory
judgment
terminating
the
differentiation
and
for
back
pay
on
behalf
of
mr.
love
and
all
those
similarly
situated.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
that
is
correct.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
we
do
not
believe
that
they
are
because
of
the
class
allegation.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
as
well
as
the
back
pay
relief
which
has
been
sought.
now,
the
tenth
circuit’s
judgment
on
rehearing,
quite
properly
in
our
judgment
determined
that
the
complaints
that
mr.
love
had
made
about
events
that
occurred
prior
to
july
2nd
1965,
the
effective
date
of
this
act,
were
not
properly
considered
in
this
case
and
its
judgment
on
rehearing
therefore,
is
quite
different
and
on
quite
different
grounds
than
its
original
judgment
in
this
case
or
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
the
court
of
appeals
ruling
on
rehearing
maybe
summarized
as
follows:
because
colorado
statutes
prohibit
discrimination
in
employment
based
on
race,
706b
says
that
no
charge
maybe
filed
with
the
eeoc
until
60
days
after
a
proceeding
under
the
colorado
statute
had
been
initiated
or
such
earlier
time
as
such
a
proceeding
is
terminated.
mr.
love
did
not
go
to
the
colorado
agency
in
1966.
he
went
directly
to
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
as
many
others
do.
the
eeoc
then
referred
his
complaint
to
the
colorado
agency
and
was
specifically
advised
by
it
that.
colorado
wanted
nothing
further
to
do
with
it.
when
mr.
love’s
complaint
was
rejected
by
the
colorado
civil
rights
commission,
the
eeoc
then
commenced
to
process
the
charge
which
it
already
physically
had
in
its
possession.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
the
letter
which
she
sent
to
it
on
may
19th.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
that
is
correct.
the
opinion
on
hearing
says
that
the
eeoc
cannot
consider
the
letter
of
may
19
as
the
basis
of
the
charge
because
it
was
physically
received
by
the
eeoc
prior
to
the
time
when
any
approach
had
been
made
to
the
colorado
civil
rights
commission.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
that
is
right.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
that
is
correct.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
that
is
correct.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
well,
the
opinion
can
be
read
to
the
effect
that
the
referral
of
the
complaint
by
the
eeoc
is
not
proper.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
that
is
right.
and
there
is
the
indication
is
that
he
physically
personally
must
do
it.
the
decision
thus
requires
that
one
administrative
agency,
the
eeoc
which
is
receiving
complaints
from
the
most
unsophisticated
of
our
citizens
must
ascertain
at
the
time
the
charge
is
received
by
it,
either
from
the
complainant
or
from
a
state
administrative
agency
whether
or
not
a
complaint
had
been
lodged
with
that
state
agency.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
that
is
correct.
and
he
also
has
been
advised
that
he
could
come
back.
but
he
has
to
do
so
within
very
prescribed
time
limits.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
that
would
be
30
days.
in
other
words
30
days
after
the
termination
of
the
state
proceeding.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
intermittently,
the,
forgive
me
your
honor.
the
30
day
would
be
the
minimum
time
and
60
days
after
the
state
proceeding
has
commenced
he
may
then
come
back.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
that
is
correct.
the
lower
courts
had
trouble
with
that.
we
point
out
two
things
that
i
do,
we
are
dealing
with
the
mechanical
steps
that
people
who
believe
they
have
been
discriminated
against
must
follow.
after
hearing
--
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
well,
we
feel
that
title
vii
creates
federal
rights
which
are
to
be
enforced
by
a
federal
agency
in
the
united
states
district
courts.
the
policy
behind
706b,
the
congressional
policy
is
to
give
the
states
the
first
track
at
resolving
those
problems.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
that
is
right.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
as
long
as
the
state
agency
has
an
opportunity
to
rectify
the
claim
of
the
--
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
that
is
our
position.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
and
the
provision
will
--
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
we
would
say
that
was
a
useless
act.
they
already
have
the
claim
in
their
file.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
we
feel
--
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
yes.
we
do
not
believe
the
federal
statute
creates
federal
rights.
the
policy
is
to
give
the
state
an
opportunity
to
intercede
but
regardless
of
whether
they
do
or
do
not.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
that
is
right.
the
state
whether
or
not
the
state
takes
action
affirmatively
or
not
--
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
that
is
correct.
and
for
that
period
of
time,
you
are
quite
right.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
well,
mr.
justice
white,
the
deferral
period
is
built
in
to
the
statute
but
whether
or
not
the
state
acts
on
the
complaint
is
immaterial.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
to
that
extent,
i
would
agree
with
that
statement.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
mr.

letter
to
the
state
statute.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
that
is
my
reference.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
it
would
indicate
whatever
is
sent.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
or
by
the
individual
complainant,
i
suppose.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
there
was
none.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
i
am
not
prepared,
in
this
case
or
in
related
case
generally?
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
well,
in
answer
to
that
question
i
think
there
has
been
litigation
in
the
norman
case
from
your
old
circuit
and
i
think
the
conclusion
reached
in
those
and
other
cases
has
been
that
that
is
not
an
exclusive
remedy
and
that
the
federal
rights
created
by
title
vii
of
the
’64
act
can
be
exercised
regardless
of
whether
or
not
an
attempt
is
made
to
seek
redress
under
collective
bargaining
agreements.
in
answer
to
your
specific
question
here,
in
this
case,
there
is
no
record
that
mr.
love
made
any
formal
attempt
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
that
he
was
working
under
as
a
porter.
well,
the
eeoc
after
having
been
told
by
the
colorado
commission
that
the
colorado
commission
did
not
want
to
proceed
went
forward
and
put
mr.
love’s
charge
on
an
official
form
which
was
sworn
to
on
july
23rd,
served
that
on
the
pullman
company
which
under
regulations
then
and
now
in
effect
had
the
right
at
that
time
to
respond
to
the
charge
of
discrimination
that
had
been
lodged
with
the
eeoc.
during
the
course
of
the
next
two
years,
the
eeoc
investigated,
found
probable
cause,
attempted
to
conciliate
and
being
unable
to
do
so,
on
may
28th,
1968,
mr.
love
filed
this
litigation.
six
months
thereafter,
on
december
3rd
1968,
the
pullman
company
moved
to
dismiss
and
it
is
that
motion
that
dismissed
which
was
granted.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
the
relief
sought
in
the
complaint
in
this
case
at
that
time
and
still
is
for
a
declaratory
judgment
terminating
the
differentiation
and
for
back
pay
on
behalf
of
mr.
love
and
all
those
similarly
situated.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
that
is
correct.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
we
do
not
believe
that
they
are
because
of
the
class
allegation.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
as
well
as
the
back
pay
relief
which
has
been
sought.
now,
the
tenth
circuit’s
judgment
on
rehearing,
quite
properly
in
our
judgment
determined
that
the
complaints
that
mr.
love
had
made
about
events
that
occurred
prior
to
july
2nd
1965,
the
effective
date
of
this
act,
were
not
properly
considered
in
this
case
and
its
judgment
on
rehearing
therefore,
is
quite
different
and
on
quite
different
grounds
than
its
original
judgment
in
this
case
or
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
the
court
of
appeals
ruling
on
rehearing
maybe
summarized
as
follows:
because
colorado
statutes
prohibit
discrimination
in
employment
based
on
race,
706b
says
that
no
charge
maybe
filed
with
the
eeoc
until
60
days
after
a
proceeding
under
the
colorado
statute
had
been
initiated
or
such
earlier
time
as
such
a
proceeding
is
terminated.
mr.
love
did
not
go
to
the
colorado
agency
in
1966.
he
went
directly
to
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
as
many
others
do.
the
eeoc
then
referred
his
complaint
to
the
colorado
agency
and
was
specifically
advised
by
it
that.
colorado
wanted
nothing
further
to
do
with
it.
when
mr.
love’s
complaint
was
rejected
by
the
colorado
civil
rights
commission,
the
eeoc
then
commenced
to
process
the
charge
which
it
already
physically
had
in
its
possession.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
the
letter
which
she
sent
to
it
on
may
19th.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
that
is
correct.
the
opinion
on
hearing
says
that
the
eeoc
cannot
consider
the
letter
of
may
19
as
the
basis
of
the
charge
because
it
was
physically
received
by
the
eeoc
prior
to
the
time
when
any
approach
had
been
made
to
the
colorado
civil
rights
commission.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
that
is
right.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
that
is
correct.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
that
is
correct.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
well,
the
opinion
can
be
read
to
the
effect
that
the
referral
of
the
complaint
by
the
eeoc
is
not
proper.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
that
is
right.
and
there
is
the
indication
is
that
he
physically
personally
must
do
it.
the
decision
thus
requires
that
one
administrative
agency,
the
eeoc
which
is
receiving
complaints
from
the
most
unsophisticated
of
our
citizens
must
ascertain
at
the
time
the
charge
is
received
by
it,
either
from
the
complainant
or
from
a
state
administrative
agency
whether
or
not
a
complaint
had
been
lodged
with
that
state
agency.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
that
is
correct.
and
he
also
has
been
advised
that
he
could
come
back.
but
he
has
to
do
so
within
very
prescribed
time
limits.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
that
would
be
30
days.
in
other
words
30
days
after
the
termination
of
the
state
proceeding.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
intermittently,
the,
forgive
me
your
honor.
the
30
day
would
be
the
minimum
time
and
60
days
after
the
state
proceeding
has
commenced
he
may
then
come
back.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
that
is
correct.
the
lower
courts
had
trouble
with
that.
we
point
out
two
things
that
i
do,
we
are
dealing
with
the
mechanical
steps
that
people
who
believe
they
have
been
discriminated
against
must
follow.
after
hearing
--
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
well,
we
feel
that
title
vii
creates
federal
rights
which
are
to
be
enforced
by
a
federal
agency
in
the
united
states
district
courts.
the
policy
behind
706b,
the
congressional
policy
is
to
give
the
states
the
first
track
at
resolving
those
problems.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
that
is
right.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
as
long
as
the
state
agency
has
an
opportunity
to
rectify
the
claim
of
the
--
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
that
is
our
position.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
and
the
provision
will
--
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
we
would
say
that
was
a
useless
act.
they
already
have
the
claim
in
their
file.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
we
feel
--
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
yes.
we
do
not
believe
the
federal
statute
creates
federal
rights.
the
policy
is
to
give
the
state
an
opportunity
to
intercede
but
regardless
of
whether
they
do
or
do
not.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
that
is
right.
the
state
whether
or
not
the
state
takes
action
affirmatively
or
not
--
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
that
is
correct.
and
for
that
period
of
time,
you
are
quite
right.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
well,
mr.
justice
white,
the
deferral
period
is
built
in
to
the
statute
but
whether
or
not
the
state
acts
on
the
complaint
is
immaterial.
mr.
hugh
j.
mcclearn
to
that
extent,
i
would
agree
with
that
statement.
