justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
telling
us
that
it
is
crystal
clear
on
the
face
of
the
statute
that
what
congress
said
was,
“employee
could
go
to
the
state
agency
if
there
is
one.
you
go
within
certain
time
and
you
get
its
determination
within
the
certain
time
where
after
a
certain
lapse
of
time,
then
you
start
all
over
again
before
the
federal
commission.
and
unless
you
do
those
two
things,
no
matter
what
happens
in
either
agency
if
they
are
adverse,
you
cannot
ever
get
any
judicial
relief”?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
did
not
mean
to
put
it
that
way.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
what
i
meant
to
put
was
you
have
to
wait
a
certain
length
of
time.
i
gather,it
is
60
days,
you
have
to
go
to
the
state
agency.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
any
that
whatever
maybe
the
time
of
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
will
you
tell
me
what
you
think,
what
you
say
the
statute
said.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
commenced
by
the
authority?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
certainly
you
say
that
if
he
goes
in
the
federal
commission
first,
the
federal
commission
cannot
send
it
to
the
state.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh
you
do
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
the
federal
body
send
it
to
the
state
body?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
now,
at
least
it
has
to
be
before
the
state
body
first?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
how
long
do
you
say
it
has
to
be
there
before
being
held
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whatever
that
time
is,
then
he
has
to
file
all
over
again
with
the
federal
body,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
brand
new,
even
though
it
is
the
identical
complaint
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
get
your
position,
even
if
whatever
it
is
that
takes
to
get
the
names
of
the
state
had
been
complied,
after
the
state
finished
with
it,
nevertheless,
eeoc
cannot
move
on
it
until
the
employee
then
bring
something
within
30
days
that
the
states
finished
back
to
the
eeoc,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
your
position?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
has
never
been
a
state
after
the
enactment
of
the
civil
rights
act,
there
has
never
been
a
state
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
by
anybody?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
that
they
responded
to
then
when
they
said
we
were
no
part
of
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
nothing
has
ever
been
referred
to
the
state
in
writing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it
is
because
there
has
been
a
failure
to
submit
anything
to
the
state
agency
in
writing,
the
states
never
for
purposes
of
the
statute
had
anything?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
the
national
arbitration
you
mean,
the
adjustment
to
for
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes
i
know.
i
just
wonder
what
you
are
talking
about
the,
i
just
never
heard
of
the
national
railway
arbitration.
