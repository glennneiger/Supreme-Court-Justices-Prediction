mr.
edward
c.
eppich
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
is
important
to
begin
with
to
straighten
out
the
sequence
of
filing
requirement
of
section
706
and
the
time
requirements
of
section
706.
the
act
is
quite
clear
for
the
states
that
no
charge
maybe
filed
with
the
act
until
a
state
proceeding
was
commenced.
that
is
what
the
act
says
and
there
is
just
in
my
humble
opinion
no
room
for
construction
otherwise.
in
this
particular
case,
mr.
love,
at
no
time
filed
a
written
charge
with
the
colorado
state
commission
nor
any
time
was
a
written
charge
filed
on
mr.
love’s
behalf.
initially
and
in
the
trial
court,
we,
because
the
state
did
listen
to
mr.
love’s
oral
claim,
and
because
the
state
did
take
some
affirmative
action
and
did
terminate
the
proceedings,
the
trial
court
decided,
yes
he
had
complied
with
commencing
a
state
proceeding
as
required
by
the
act
but
we
must
then
look
at
the
timeliness
requirements
of
section
706(d)
which
state
an
equally
equivocal
terms.
that
the
man
must
then
file
with
eeoc
within
30
days
after
the
state
has
terminated
proceedings
or
over
than
210
days
after
the
alleged
unlawful
employment
practice
has
occurred,
whichever
is
earlier.
it
is
just
that
simple.
it
is
just
that
clear.
and
that
posture
went
up
to
the
tenth
circuit
and
the
tenth
circuit
affirmed
on
the
timeliness
issue.
at
that
point
however,
the
equal
employment
opportunities
commission
interjected
into
the
case
their
deferral
regulation
which
is
set
forth
in
their
brief
and
also
in
our
brief
and
tried
to
justify
their
procedures
utilized
in
this
case
based
upon
a
1968
regulation
which
of
course
was
not
in
force
at
the
time
that
this
particular
matter
transpired.
it
was
at
that
point
that
judge
seth
(ph)
made
the
comments
about
the
deferral
regulations.
then
on
we
hearing,
it
was
pointed
out
to
the
court
that
title
vii
of
civil
rights
act
did
not
become
effective
until
july
2,
1965.
accordingly,
the
matters
before
the
state
in
1965
had
to
antedate
the
jurisdiction
of
the
equal
employment
opportunities
commission
and
hence,
they
could
not
be
the
basis
on
determining
the
timeliness
and
hence,
the
basis
for
the
decision.
it
was
at
this
point
that
we
got
into
the
manipulative
trial
and
debates
and
in
manipulative
procedures.
because
this
record
is
very
clear
and
the
trial
court
so
found
that
there
was
one
filing
date
in
this
case,
that
is
may
23.
1966.
it
was
not
until
the
appellate
arguments
that
the
equal
employment
opportunities
commission
decided
to
say,
“well,
we
will
use
another
filing
date."
this,
the
tenth
circuit
did
not
think
was
proper.
with
that
thought
in
line
gentlemen,
i
would
like
--
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
this
time
i
cannot,
your
honor.
there
has
been
no
hearing
on
the
waiver.
now,
as
far
as
the
prejudice
is
concerned,
we
certainly
have
a
lapse
of
time
but
other
than
that,
no
i
cannot
really
say
that
pullman
company
has
been
prejudiced
but
i
think
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
subject
matter
jurisdiction
granted.
there
is
no
question
that
the
racial
discrimination
is
invidious
and
we
are
not
questioning
that
at
all.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
prior
to
the
civil
rights
act
of
1965,
as
wrongful
as
the
discrimination
might
have
been,
it
was
not
an
action
of
a
wrong,
at
least
not
in
the
federal
courts.
congress
created
statutory
right.
and
within
that
statutory
right,
congress
imposed
certain
limitations,
and
certain
guidelines,
and
certain
things
that
had
to
be
done.
and
gentlemen,
a
reading
of
this
act
can
lead
that
to
two
conclusions.
one
is
thou
shalt
go
to
the
state
first
and
thou
shalt
thereafter
go
to
the
equal
employment
opportunities
commission
from
the
time
there
in
prescribed.
and
failure
to
do
that
sir,
has
been
held
each
time
by
each
circuit
court
to
be
a
jurisdictional
deficiency.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
i
cannot
answer
the
question
sir,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
i
should
imagine
that
way,
that
is
far
back
in
the
--
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
the
pullman
company
sir,
no
longer
has
porter
in
charge
as
the
operations
had
been
turned
over.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
well,
sir
i
do
not
know
why
it
was
limited
but
it
sounds
like
a
very
technical
situation
but
it
is
not
gentleman.
congress,
in
the
legislative
history
of
be
it
as
marked
in
some
areas
is
quite
clear
in
one
area
and
that
is
the
states
will
have
the
initial
opportunity
to
take
care
of
these
matters
and
resolve
them
at
the
local
level.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
yes
sir
that
is
what
i
am
saying,
that
the
act
is
just
that
clear.
now
with
one
exception.
as
i
understood
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
question
was
that
regardless
of
what
the
state
did,
you
still
could
not
go
back
to
the
equal
employment
opportunities
commission.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
right,
that
is
not
the
case.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
alright,
it
can
be
either
60
days
or
30
days
after
the
state
has
terminated
its
proceedings.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
no,
let
me
straighten
this
out,
this
is
a
little
confusing.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
the
statute
says
this
and
i
can
refer
the
court
in
section
706(d)
where
it
says
no
charge
maybe
filed.
it
is
just
that
no
charge
maybe
filed
with
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
until
the
state
proceeding
has
been
commenced.
alright,
that
provides
that
for
60
days
--
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
this
is
an
interesting
question
sir.
it
is
not
entirely
clear
i
would
suggest
this
to
you.
when
the
bill
initially
came
out
of
the
house
into
the
senate,
it
contained
the
language,
the
expressed
language
that
the
charge
could
be
filed
by
or
in
behalf
of
the
person
agreed.
now,
in
the
senate,
in
the
erikson
landfill
amendment
to
it,
which
eventually
became
the
law,
removed
those
words
on
individual
behalf
and
just
left
in
the
words
“filed
by
the
individual”.
now,
i
am
not
going
to
sit
here
and
tell
this
court
that
the
lawyer
could
not
file
a
charge
with
the
equal
employment
opportunities
commission
or
with
the
state.
but
nevertheless,
the
act
does
state
that
you
will
to
the
state
first
and
then
--
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
i
do
not
see
that
sir.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
no
sir.
i
say
that
the
federal
body
cannot
accept
the
charge
for
filing
unless
the
man
has
been
to
the
state
first
because
that
is
what
the
act
says.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
i
have
no
objection
to
that
sir.
i
certainly
think
they
can.
if
they
are
acting
solely
in
the
capacity
as
a
conduit.
in
other
words,
here
is
a
misdirected
complaint.
it
was
sent
to
the
wrong
place,
we
are
going
to
forward
it
on
to
the
proper
body.
i
have
no
question
with
that.
no
problem
with
that
at
all.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
no
question
about
it
sir.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
60
days
or
30
days
depending.
it
could
be
early.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
yes.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
or
some
further
direction,
some
further
direction,
if
any,
some
further
different
direction.
something
plenty
to
revive
that
which
he
previously,
the
prematurely
did.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
sir,
he
never
filed
with
the
state
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
that
is
correct.
however,
i
do
not
believe
that
he
has
to
file
an
identical
charge.
i
think
that
is
all
that
is
required
is
that
some
direction
be
given
by
him
to
revive
that
charge,
in
other
words
refer
to
my
complaint
and
let
us
get
it
off.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
well,
i
think
your
honor
--
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
it
is
not
in
the
record
but
they
did
sir.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
yes.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
no
sir.
i
think
the
commission
too,
is
required
to
go
to
the
state.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
i
am
lost
now,
pardon
me.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
are
we
presupposing
the
matter
has
been
before
the
state.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
sir
it
was
not
before
the
state,
it
never
did
get
before
the
state.
let
me
try
this
sir
again.
the
matter
was
never
before
the
state,
because
at
the
time
mr.
love
proceeded
before
the
state,
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
had
not
become
effective.
therefore,
the
jurisdictional
arm
of
title
vii
was
not
in
play.
therefore,
his
acts
before
the
state
cannot
be
considered
for
any
purpose.
however
if
you
are
going
to
consider
him
for
being
--
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
in
that
regard,
let
us
find
out
how
they
referred
it
to
the
state.
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
is
a
sharp
talk,
sharp
talk
type
of
discussion
between
a
representative
of
the
equal
employment
opportunities
commission
and
the
director
of
the
colorado
civil
rights
commission.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
like,
i
think
would
be
much
more
difficult
case
from
my
stand
point
sir.
there
is
very
simple
reason
that
both
the
state
and
the
federal
act
require
that
filing
of
written
complaint
to
start
a
state
proceeding.
and
i
do
not
believe
that
this
is
meaningless
procedural
requirement.
i
do
not
know
of
any
proceeding
that
be
commenced
without
something
in
writing,
and
this
is
a
simple.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
well,
that
is
what
their
interpretation
of
the
time
set,
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
i
do
not
think
we
get
to
that
point
here
because
--
it
is
before
the
state
sir.
now
--
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
there
has
never
been
a
written
charge
filed
with
the
state
of
colorado,
no
sir.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
by
anybody.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
apparently
the
sharp
talk
type
discussion
when
overall
policy
of
the
eeoc
and
the
colorado
commission
--
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
precisely,
and
having
that
decided
by
the
state,
the
requirement
that
they
first
go
to
the
state,
the
eeoc
has
never
got
into
it.
and
let
us
assume
that
this
oral
advice
method
is
proper,
is
a
proper
referral,
and
realizing
that
matters
such
as
notice,
and
matters
such
as
preserving
a
record,
and
matters
such
as
some
sort
of
an
orderly
proceeding
which
generally
follow
the
filing
of
written
complaint.
we
then
get
back
to
the
situation.
well,
is
this
referral
procedure
that
the
eeoc
is
trying
to
establish
here,
is
it
proper?
i
do
not
think
it
is.
if
it
is
only
to
misdirect
the
misguided
complaints,
that
is
one
thing.
and
if
it
is
designed
to
get
the
complaint
and
to
get
the
man
before
the
state
so
that
the
state
can
take
some
meaningful
action,
then
i
have
to
quarrel
with
it.
i
think
that
is
proper.
i
think
that
is
in
keeping
with
the
statute.
i
think
that
is
in
keeping
with
the
congressional
intent
the
state
had
first
--
but
the
regulation
of
the
eeoc
is
asking
this
court
to
hold,
there
is
more
than
that.
what
in
effect
it
does
it
says
this,
when
this
charges
come
in,
let
us
bear
in
mind
we
are
not
talking
about
filing
dates
because
we
are
talking
limitation
period.
when
these
charges
come
in,
the
eeoc
says
we
will
take
the
time
to
stop
them,
that
they
will
send
them
a
copy
of
it
to
the
state.
and
then
without
further
word
or
act,
the
complaining
party
unless
we
have
heard
the
contrary,
we
will
on
our
own
hook,
undertake
and
resolve
this
matter
for
you.
gentlemen
i
submit
that
that
does
nothing
to
play
lip
service.
to
the
requirement,
states
have
the
first
opportunity
to
do
this
thing
because
what
happens;
the
charges
go
into
the
federal
government
first,
the
federal
agency
first,
and
for
all
practical
purposes,
the
mechanics
of
the
statute
are
complied
with.
but
the
state
did
not
get
a
meaningful
whack
at
it.
i
certainly
do
not,
an
oral
reference
and
that
is
what
they
are
asking
this
court
to
do;
to
affirm
an
oral
reference
and
secondly
to
say
that
you
can
have
a
proceeding
without
a
written
complaint.
i
just
cannot
see
that
that
regulation
accomplishes
a
congressional
purpose.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
well,
sir
first
of
i
think
we
would
probably
get
in
the
national
railway
arbitration
act,
because
of
course
the
labor
agreements
with
both
the
porters
union
and
the
conductors
union
are,
as
i
understand
had
entered
into
under
the
offices
of
other
national
railway
arbitration
act.
whether
or
not
he
has
an
arbitration,
if
you
reversed
whether
or
not
we
would
raise
that
as
a
defense
on
our
own,
i
do
not
know.
probably
not.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
national
railway
labor
act
as
advised
by
the
pullman
company
is
under
the
office
of
whom
these
labor
agreements
were
in
the
interest,
sir.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
so
you
got
to
say
pullman
company,
in
this
situation
they
entered
into
an
agreement
of
the
office
one
federal
act.
this
is
the
labor
agreement.
they
are
paying
conductors
extra,
paying
porters
why.
well
another
piece
of
federal
legislation
comes
along
and
says
that
at
least
mr.
love
said
that
this
is
discriminatory
against
--
where
does
it
fit
gentlemen,
i
frankly
do
not
know.
i
have
not
straightened
it
out.
but
i
do
believe
it
is
going
to
be
a
problem
and
i
do
believe
that
eventually
be
raised.
and
then
this
simply
effect
the
jurisdictional
matters
are
dispose
off
contrary
as
pullman
company’s
position
to
its
trial
on
the
merits.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
in
the
united
states
in
district
of
colorado.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
yes
sir.
yes
sir
it
does.
in
may
of
1966,
at
some
place
between
may
23
and
june
1,
it
has
to
--
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
yes
sir.
to
say
that
it
is
a
proper
filing
when
first
disregards
the
clear
statutory
language
that
a
written
complaint
be
filed.
because
this
best
was
an
oral
communication,
the
exact
nature
which
we
do
not
know
and
this
i
say
we
cannot
do.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
no
sir.
not
to
the
state.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
no
sir,
at
no
time.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
apparently
it
came
up
when
a
representative
of
the
equal
employment
opportunities
commission
was
in
denver
talking
with
mr.
reynolds
about
overall
policies.
in
other
words,
what
are
we
going
to
do
with,
how
we
are
going
to
set
this
thing
up
to
make
it
work?
and
mr.
love
came
up
just
kind
of
an
aside,
a
collateral
matter.
this
is
what
they
are
doing
upon
this
court;
to
have
the
dignity
of
commencing
a
state
proceeding
in
courts
of
federal
legislation.
when
the
federal
act
itself
specifically
states
that
you
will
file
a
written
complaint.
i
am
aware
of
no
proceeding
can
be
started
in
this
matter.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
this
is
questionable
sir
whether
it
did
in
fact
know
what
was
all
about.
this
get
us
back
to
this
problem
with
the
labor
management
agreements.
at
least
according
to
mr.
love’s
letter
to
the
equal
employment
opportunities
commission,
he
says
that
the
commission
did
not
understand
my
complaint.
so,
we
must
take
mr.
love's
and
his
word.
i
think
he
was
more
to
it
than
that.
mr.
reynolds
testified
his
deposition
that
when
the
matter
was
initially
before
them
in
1965,
the
colorado
commission
was
not
recognizing
discrimination
through
labor
agreement
as
such.
in
other
words,
this
was
not
a
discriminatory
practice.
however
he
testified
in
1966
that
the
colorado
commission
views
in
this
have
changed.
and
that
they
were
now
recognizing
that
a
man
could
be
discriminated
against
through
his
particular
collective
bargaining
agreement.
so
what
i
cannot
tell
this
court
nor
would
the
tenth
circuit
say
and
as
a
matter
fact
as
they
specifically
said
that
a
referral
in
1966,
they
would
not
say,
--
would
have
been
totally
futile.
and
based
upon
this
record,
they
could
not.
i
suggest
to
this
court
that
it
may
well
have
been.
that
had
mr.
love
or
someone
on
behalf
of
him
submitted
this
written
charge
to
the
colorado
commission.
the
colorado
commission
would
have
considered
it
and
considered
it
in
view
of
their
enlightened
views
on
discrimination.
this
discrimination
is
a
changing
thing.
i
think
we
all
recognize
that.
colorado
is
no
different
but
they
recognized
in
’66
that
being
discriminatory
they
did
not
recognize
in
’65.
what
they
recognized
in
’65,
they
did
not
recognize
in
’60
so
on
down
the
line.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
that
is
correct
sir,
yes.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
yes
sir
and
at
that
time
all
record
not
entirely
clear
apparently
a
finding
of
no
discrimination
was
made.
but
here
again,
you
see
mr.
love
is
tied
in
to
his
union,
to
this
management
agreements.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
came
back
to
1965.
and
at
which
point
they
could
make
him
connector
but
because
of
the
seniority
rules,
and
the
course
of
the
fact
that
fringes
for
all
the
state
and
attributed
services
added,
or
there
is
just
no
work
available.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
he
does
not
want
to
be
paid
less.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
that
is
yes.
that
is
as
i
understand
it.
but,
he
just
did
not
comply
with
the
act.
and
i
think
we
also
have
to
bear
in
mind
one
other
thing.
he
was
advised,
at
least
judging
from
mr.
reynolds
so
called
waiver
letter
of
june
1966.
he
was
advised
to
return
the
colorado
commission
and
file
a
written
complaint.
we
do
not
have
a
situation
here
of
a
man
being
totally
mislead
or
led
down
the
garden
path.
he
was
told
by
the
director
to
do,
he
chose
not
to.
that
is
certainly
his
decision
but
i
believe
congress
gave
him
a
right
that
is
now
previously
on
a
concept
to
that
man
to
comply
with
it.
what
congress
says
he
will
do,
obtain
remedies
under
that.
there
is
one
other
danger
here
gentlemen.
i
think
it
should
be
called
to
your
attention.
in
his
getting
back
again
in
this
manipulated
filing
date,
a
filing
date
could
make
it
have
at
one
time
that
is
when
its
is
received,
it
is
filed.
the
eeoc
would
seem
to
say
well,
we
can
file
them.
at
this
time
when
we
receive
them
or
we
can
sit
on
and
wait
on
it
for
a
while
and
then
fit
it
to
the
scheme
of
thing
so
that
nobody
is
out
at
court.
i
suggest
that
this
practice
that
they
do
not
file
things
when
they
receive
it
could
well
deprive
a
man
of
his
day
in
court,
a
man
who
has
complied
with
the
act.
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
he
must
go
to
the
state
first
and
thereafter,
he
has
only
30
days
within
which
to
file
with
the
eeoc.
let
us
assume
the
man
has
gone
to
the
state.
let
us
assume
that
on
the
29th
day
he
sends
this
charge
into
the
equal
employment
opportunities
commission
and
instead
of
filing
it,
they
refer
it
back
to
the
state.
gentlemen
that
man
is
out
of
court
and
yet
he
has
done
everything
that
the
law
requires
him
because
the
eeoc
did
not
filed
it.
there
can
only
one
filing
date
and
it
should
not
give
them
the
opportunity
to
manipulate
these
things
because
as
i
say,
the
man
has
done
what
he
is
supposed
to
do
and
is
not
allowed
to
be
in
court.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
is
important
to
begin
with
to
straighten
out
the
sequence
of
filing
requirement
of
section
706
and
the
time
requirements
of
section
706.
the
act
is
quite
clear
for
the
states
that
no
charge
maybe
filed
with
the
act
until
a
state
proceeding
was
commenced.
that
is
what
the
act
says
and
there
is
just
in
my
humble
opinion
no
room
for
construction
otherwise.
in
this
particular
case,
mr.
love,
at
no
time
filed
a
written
charge
with
the
colorado
state
commission
nor
any
time
was
a
written
charge
filed
on
mr.
love’s
behalf.
initially
and
in
the
trial
court,
we,
because
the
state
did
listen
to
mr.
love’s
oral
claim,
and
because
the
state
did
take
some
affirmative
action
and
did
terminate
the
proceedings,
the
trial
court
decided,
yes
he
had
complied
with
commencing
a
state
proceeding
as
required
by
the
act
but
we
must
then
look
at
the
timeliness
requirements
of
section
706(d)
which
state
an
equally
equivocal
terms.
that
the
man
must
then
file
with
eeoc
within
30
days
after
the
state
has
terminated
proceedings
or
over
than
210
days
after
the
alleged
unlawful
employment
practice
has
occurred,
whichever
is
earlier.
it
is
just
that
simple.
it
is
just
that
clear.
and
that
posture
went
up
to
the
tenth
circuit
and
the
tenth
circuit
affirmed
on
the
timeliness
issue.
at
that
point
however,
the
equal
employment
opportunities
commission
interjected
into
the
case
their
deferral
regulation
which
is
set
forth
in
their
brief
and
also
in
our
brief
and
tried
to
justify
their
procedures
utilized
in
this
case
based
upon
a
1968
regulation
which
of
course
was
not
in
force
at
the
time
that
this
particular
matter
transpired.
it
was
at
that
point
that
judge
seth
(ph)
made
the
comments
about
the
deferral
regulations.
then
on
we
hearing,
it
was
pointed
out
to
the
court
that
title
vii
of
civil
rights
act
did
not
become
effective
until
july
2,
1965.
accordingly,
the
matters
before
the
state
in
1965
had
to
antedate
the
jurisdiction
of
the
equal
employment
opportunities
commission
and
hence,
they
could
not
be
the
basis
on
determining
the
timeliness
and
hence,
the
basis
for
the
decision.
it
was
at
this
point
that
we
got
into
the
manipulative
trial
and
debates
and
in
manipulative
procedures.
because
this
record
is
very
clear
and
the
trial
court
so
found
that
there
was
one
filing
date
in
this
case,
that
is
may
23.
1966.
it
was
not
until
the
appellate
arguments
that
the
equal
employment
opportunities
commission
decided
to
say,
“well,
we
will
use
another
filing
date."
this,
the
tenth
circuit
did
not
think
was
proper.
with
that
thought
in
line
gentlemen,
i
would
like
--
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
this
time
i
cannot,
your
honor.
there
has
been
no
hearing
on
the
waiver.
now,
as
far
as
the
prejudice
is
concerned,
we
certainly
have
a
lapse
of
time
but
other
than
that,
no
i
cannot
really
say
that
pullman
company
has
been
prejudiced
but
i
think
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
subject
matter
jurisdiction
granted.
there
is
no
question
that
the
racial
discrimination
is
invidious
and
we
are
not
questioning
that
at
all.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
prior
to
the
civil
rights
act
of
1965,
as
wrongful
as
the
discrimination
might
have
been,
it
was
not
an
action
of
a
wrong,
at
least
not
in
the
federal
courts.
congress
created
statutory
right.
and
within
that
statutory
right,
congress
imposed
certain
limitations,
and
certain
guidelines,
and
certain
things
that
had
to
be
done.
and
gentlemen,
a
reading
of
this
act
can
lead
that
to
two
conclusions.
one
is
thou
shalt
go
to
the
state
first
and
thou
shalt
thereafter
go
to
the
equal
employment
opportunities
commission
from
the
time
there
in
prescribed.
and
failure
to
do
that
sir,
has
been
held
each
time
by
each
circuit
court
to
be
a
jurisdictional
deficiency.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
i
cannot
answer
the
question
sir,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
i
should
imagine
that
way,
that
is
far
back
in
the
--
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
the
pullman
company
sir,
no
longer
has
porter
in
charge
as
the
operations
had
been
turned
over.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
well,
sir
i
do
not
know
why
it
was
limited
but
it
sounds
like
a
very
technical
situation
but
it
is
not
gentleman.
congress,
in
the
legislative
history
of
be
it
as
marked
in
some
areas
is
quite
clear
in
one
area
and
that
is
the
states
will
have
the
initial
opportunity
to
take
care
of
these
matters
and
resolve
them
at
the
local
level.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
yes
sir
that
is
what
i
am
saying,
that
the
act
is
just
that
clear.
now
with
one
exception.
as
i
understood
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
question
was
that
regardless
of
what
the
state
did,
you
still
could
not
go
back
to
the
equal
employment
opportunities
commission.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
right,
that
is
not
the
case.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
alright,
it
can
be
either
60
days
or
30
days
after
the
state
has
terminated
its
proceedings.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
no,
let
me
straighten
this
out,
this
is
a
little
confusing.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
the
statute
says
this
and
i
can
refer
the
court
in
section
706(d)
where
it
says
no
charge
maybe
filed.
it
is
just
that
no
charge
maybe
filed
with
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
until
the
state
proceeding
has
been
commenced.
alright,
that
provides
that
for
60
days
--
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
this
is
an
interesting
question
sir.
it
is
not
entirely
clear
i
would
suggest
this
to
you.
when
the
bill
initially
came
out
of
the
house
into
the
senate,
it
contained
the
language,
the
expressed
language
that
the
charge
could
be
filed
by
or
in
behalf
of
the
person
agreed.
now,
in
the
senate,
in
the
erikson
landfill
amendment
to
it,
which
eventually
became
the
law,
removed
those
words
on
individual
behalf
and
just
left
in
the
words
“filed
by
the
individual”.
now,
i
am
not
going
to
sit
here
and
tell
this
court
that
the
lawyer
could
not
file
a
charge
with
the
equal
employment
opportunities
commission
or
with
the
state.
but
nevertheless,
the
act
does
state
that
you
will
to
the
state
first
and
then
--
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
i
do
not
see
that
sir.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
no
sir.
i
say
that
the
federal
body
cannot
accept
the
charge
for
filing
unless
the
man
has
been
to
the
state
first
because
that
is
what
the
act
says.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
i
have
no
objection
to
that
sir.
i
certainly
think
they
can.
if
they
are
acting
solely
in
the
capacity
as
a
conduit.
in
other
words,
here
is
a
misdirected
complaint.
it
was
sent
to
the
wrong
place,
we
are
going
to
forward
it
on
to
the
proper
body.
i
have
no
question
with
that.
no
problem
with
that
at
all.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
no
question
about
it
sir.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
60
days
or
30
days
depending.
it
could
be
early.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
yes.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
or
some
further
direction,
some
further
direction,
if
any,
some
further
different
direction.
something
plenty
to
revive
that
which
he
previously,
the
prematurely
did.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
sir,
he
never
filed
with
the
state
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
that
is
correct.
however,
i
do
not
believe
that
he
has
to
file
an
identical
charge.
i
think
that
is
all
that
is
required
is
that
some
direction
be
given
by
him
to
revive
that
charge,
in
other
words
refer
to
my
complaint
and
let
us
get
it
off.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
well,
i
think
your
honor
--
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
it
is
not
in
the
record
but
they
did
sir.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
yes.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
no
sir.
i
think
the
commission
too,
is
required
to
go
to
the
state.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
i
am
lost
now,
pardon
me.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
are
we
presupposing
the
matter
has
been
before
the
state.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
sir
it
was
not
before
the
state,
it
never
did
get
before
the
state.
let
me
try
this
sir
again.
the
matter
was
never
before
the
state,
because
at
the
time
mr.
love
proceeded
before
the
state,
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
had
not
become
effective.
therefore,
the
jurisdictional
arm
of
title
vii
was
not
in
play.
therefore,
his
acts
before
the
state
cannot
be
considered
for
any
purpose.
however
if
you
are
going
to
consider
him
for
being
--
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
in
that
regard,
let
us
find
out
how
they
referred
it
to
the
state.
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
is
a
sharp
talk,
sharp
talk
type
of
discussion
between
a
representative
of
the
equal
employment
opportunities
commission
and
the
director
of
the
colorado
civil
rights
commission.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
like,
i
think
would
be
much
more
difficult
case
from
my
stand
point
sir.
there
is
very
simple
reason
that
both
the
state
and
the
federal
act
require
that
filing
of
written
complaint
to
start
a
state
proceeding.
and
i
do
not
believe
that
this
is
meaningless
procedural
requirement.
i
do
not
know
of
any
proceeding
that
be
commenced
without
something
in
writing,
and
this
is
a
simple.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
well,
that
is
what
their
interpretation
of
the
time
set,
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
i
do
not
think
we
get
to
that
point
here
because
--
it
is
before
the
state
sir.
now
--
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
there
has
never
been
a
written
charge
filed
with
the
state
of
colorado,
no
sir.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
by
anybody.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
apparently
the
sharp
talk
type
discussion
when
overall
policy
of
the
eeoc
and
the
colorado
commission
--
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
precisely,
and
having
that
decided
by
the
state,
the
requirement
that
they
first
go
to
the
state,
the
eeoc
has
never
got
into
it.
and
let
us
assume
that
this
oral
advice
method
is
proper,
is
a
proper
referral,
and
realizing
that
matters
such
as
notice,
and
matters
such
as
preserving
a
record,
and
matters
such
as
some
sort
of
an
orderly
proceeding
which
generally
follow
the
filing
of
written
complaint.
we
then
get
back
to
the
situation.
well,
is
this
referral
procedure
that
the
eeoc
is
trying
to
establish
here,
is
it
proper?
i
do
not
think
it
is.
if
it
is
only
to
misdirect
the
misguided
complaints,
that
is
one
thing.
and
if
it
is
designed
to
get
the
complaint
and
to
get
the
man
before
the
state
so
that
the
state
can
take
some
meaningful
action,
then
i
have
to
quarrel
with
it.
i
think
that
is
proper.
i
think
that
is
in
keeping
with
the
statute.
i
think
that
is
in
keeping
with
the
congressional
intent
the
state
had
first
--
but
the
regulation
of
the
eeoc
is
asking
this
court
to
hold,
there
is
more
than
that.
what
in
effect
it
does
it
says
this,
when
this
charges
come
in,
let
us
bear
in
mind
we
are
not
talking
about
filing
dates
because
we
are
talking
limitation
period.
when
these
charges
come
in,
the
eeoc
says
we
will
take
the
time
to
stop
them,
that
they
will
send
them
a
copy
of
it
to
the
state.
and
then
without
further
word
or
act,
the
complaining
party
unless
we
have
heard
the
contrary,
we
will
on
our
own
hook,
undertake
and
resolve
this
matter
for
you.
gentlemen
i
submit
that
that
does
nothing
to
play
lip
service.
to
the
requirement,
states
have
the
first
opportunity
to
do
this
thing
because
what
happens;
the
charges
go
into
the
federal
government
first,
the
federal
agency
first,
and
for
all
practical
purposes,
the
mechanics
of
the
statute
are
complied
with.
but
the
state
did
not
get
a
meaningful
whack
at
it.
i
certainly
do
not,
an
oral
reference
and
that
is
what
they
are
asking
this
court
to
do;
to
affirm
an
oral
reference
and
secondly
to
say
that
you
can
have
a
proceeding
without
a
written
complaint.
i
just
cannot
see
that
that
regulation
accomplishes
a
congressional
purpose.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
well,
sir
first
of
i
think
we
would
probably
get
in
the
national
railway
arbitration
act,
because
of
course
the
labor
agreements
with
both
the
porters
union
and
the
conductors
union
are,
as
i
understand
had
entered
into
under
the
offices
of
other
national
railway
arbitration
act.
whether
or
not
he
has
an
arbitration,
if
you
reversed
whether
or
not
we
would
raise
that
as
a
defense
on
our
own,
i
do
not
know.
probably
not.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
national
railway
labor
act
as
advised
by
the
pullman
company
is
under
the
office
of
whom
these
labor
agreements
were
in
the
interest,
sir.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
so
you
got
to
say
pullman
company,
in
this
situation
they
entered
into
an
agreement
of
the
office
one
federal
act.
this
is
the
labor
agreement.
they
are
paying
conductors
extra,
paying
porters
why.
well
another
piece
of
federal
legislation
comes
along
and
says
that
at
least
mr.
love
said
that
this
is
discriminatory
against
--
where
does
it
fit
gentlemen,
i
frankly
do
not
know.
i
have
not
straightened
it
out.
but
i
do
believe
it
is
going
to
be
a
problem
and
i
do
believe
that
eventually
be
raised.
and
then
this
simply
effect
the
jurisdictional
matters
are
dispose
off
contrary
as
pullman
company’s
position
to
its
trial
on
the
merits.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
in
the
united
states
in
district
of
colorado.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
yes
sir.
yes
sir
it
does.
in
may
of
1966,
at
some
place
between
may
23
and
june
1,
it
has
to
--
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
yes
sir.
to
say
that
it
is
a
proper
filing
when
first
disregards
the
clear
statutory
language
that
a
written
complaint
be
filed.
because
this
best
was
an
oral
communication,
the
exact
nature
which
we
do
not
know
and
this
i
say
we
cannot
do.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
no
sir.
not
to
the
state.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
no
sir,
at
no
time.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
apparently
it
came
up
when
a
representative
of
the
equal
employment
opportunities
commission
was
in
denver
talking
with
mr.
reynolds
about
overall
policies.
in
other
words,
what
are
we
going
to
do
with,
how
we
are
going
to
set
this
thing
up
to
make
it
work?
and
mr.
love
came
up
just
kind
of
an
aside,
a
collateral
matter.
this
is
what
they
are
doing
upon
this
court;
to
have
the
dignity
of
commencing
a
state
proceeding
in
courts
of
federal
legislation.
when
the
federal
act
itself
specifically
states
that
you
will
file
a
written
complaint.
i
am
aware
of
no
proceeding
can
be
started
in
this
matter.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
this
is
questionable
sir
whether
it
did
in
fact
know
what
was
all
about.
this
get
us
back
to
this
problem
with
the
labor
management
agreements.
at
least
according
to
mr.
love’s
letter
to
the
equal
employment
opportunities
commission,
he
says
that
the
commission
did
not
understand
my
complaint.
so,
we
must
take
mr.
love's
and
his
word.
i
think
he
was
more
to
it
than
that.
mr.
reynolds
testified
his
deposition
that
when
the
matter
was
initially
before
them
in
1965,
the
colorado
commission
was
not
recognizing
discrimination
through
labor
agreement
as
such.
in
other
words,
this
was
not
a
discriminatory
practice.
however
he
testified
in
1966
that
the
colorado
commission
views
in
this
have
changed.
and
that
they
were
now
recognizing
that
a
man
could
be
discriminated
against
through
his
particular
collective
bargaining
agreement.
so
what
i
cannot
tell
this
court
nor
would
the
tenth
circuit
say
and
as
a
matter
fact
as
they
specifically
said
that
a
referral
in
1966,
they
would
not
say,
--
would
have
been
totally
futile.
and
based
upon
this
record,
they
could
not.
i
suggest
to
this
court
that
it
may
well
have
been.
that
had
mr.
love
or
someone
on
behalf
of
him
submitted
this
written
charge
to
the
colorado
commission.
the
colorado
commission
would
have
considered
it
and
considered
it
in
view
of
their
enlightened
views
on
discrimination.
this
discrimination
is
a
changing
thing.
i
think
we
all
recognize
that.
colorado
is
no
different
but
they
recognized
in
’66
that
being
discriminatory
they
did
not
recognize
in
’65.
what
they
recognized
in
’65,
they
did
not
recognize
in
’60
so
on
down
the
line.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
that
is
correct
sir,
yes.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
yes
sir
and
at
that
time
all
record
not
entirely
clear
apparently
a
finding
of
no
discrimination
was
made.
but
here
again,
you
see
mr.
love
is
tied
in
to
his
union,
to
this
management
agreements.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
came
back
to
1965.
and
at
which
point
they
could
make
him
connector
but
because
of
the
seniority
rules,
and
the
course
of
the
fact
that
fringes
for
all
the
state
and
attributed
services
added,
or
there
is
just
no
work
available.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
he
does
not
want
to
be
paid
less.
mr.
edward
c.
eppich
that
is
yes.
that
is
as
i
understand
it.
but,
he
just
did
not
comply
with
the
act.
and
i
think
we
also
have
to
bear
in
mind
one
other
thing.
he
was
advised,
at
least
judging
from
mr.
reynolds
so
called
waiver
letter
of
june
1966.
he
was
advised
to
return
the
colorado
commission
and
file
a
written
complaint.
we
do
not
have
a
situation
here
of
a
man
being
totally
mislead
or
led
down
the
garden
path.
he
was
told
by
the
director
to
do,
he
chose
not
to.
that
is
certainly
his
decision
but
i
believe
congress
gave
him
a
right
that
is
now
previously
on
a
concept
to
that
man
to
comply
with
it.
what
congress
says
he
will
do,
obtain
remedies
under
that.
there
is
one
other
danger
here
gentlemen.
i
think
it
should
be
called
to
your
attention.
in
his
getting
back
again
in
this
manipulated
filing
date,
a
filing
date
could
make
it
have
at
one
time
that
is
when
its
is
received,
it
is
filed.
the
eeoc
would
seem
to
say
well,
we
can
file
them.
at
this
time
when
we
receive
them
or
we
can
sit
on
and
wait
on
it
for
a
while
and
then
fit
it
to
the
scheme
of
thing
so
that
nobody
is
out
at
court.
i
suggest
that
this
practice
that
they
do
not
file
things
when
they
receive
it
could
well
deprive
a
man
of
his
day
in
court,
a
man
who
has
complied
with
the
act.
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
he
must
go
to
the
state
first
and
thereafter,
he
has
only
30
days
within
which
to
file
with
the
eeoc.
let
us
assume
the
man
has
gone
to
the
state.
let
us
assume
that
on
the
29th
day
he
sends
this
charge
into
the
equal
employment
opportunities
commission
and
instead
of
filing
it,
they
refer
it
back
to
the
state.
gentlemen
that
man
is
out
of
court
and
yet
he
has
done
everything
that
the
law
requires
him
because
the
eeoc
did
not
filed
it.
there
can
only
one
filing
date
and
it
should
not
give
them
the
opportunity
to
manipulate
these
things
because
as
i
say,
the
man
has
done
what
he
is
supposed
to
do
and
is
not
allowed
to
be
in
court.
