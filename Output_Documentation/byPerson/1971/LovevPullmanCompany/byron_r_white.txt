justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
form
of
the
prior
complaint?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
that,
did
they
admit
that
charge
although
it
had
been
filed
within
the
court
before
going
to
the
colorado
commission?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
it
have
that
effect
saying
no
complaint
is
pending?
justice
byron
r.
white
eeoc.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
must
be
a
complaint
before
the
eeoc
can
act
and
that
is
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
the
complaint
must
by
the
aggrieved
employee?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
that
not
tantamount
to
say
that
the
aggrieved
employee
must
first
invoke
a
state
remedy
whatever
the
state
commission,
as
they
never
go
to
the
federal
agency?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose,
well
suppose
to
do
that
as
it
finds
it
has
not
been
--
that
it
has
to
return
the
complaint
to
the
employee
and
say
you
got
have
to
go
the
state
agency
before
you
can
come
to
us.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
is
that?
is
that
60
days?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
state
proceeding
may
go
on
intermittently
--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
other
words,
60
days
after
the
employee
has
gone
to
the
state
agency,
if
he
has
not
had
a
termination,
then
he
can
come
to
eeoc.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
is
your
position?
how
do
you
think
it
should
be
constituted?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
is
it
your
position
that
it
does
not
matter
let,
him
come
to
the
federal
agency.
the
federal
agency
should
not
move
but
invoke
the
state
agency
to
proceed.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
long
as
it
ought
not
to
be
denied
it
merely
because
he
did
not
go
to
the
state
agency
first.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
interpretation
that
the
federal
agency
gives
the
state
agency
that
opportunity.
justice
byron
r.
white
by
transferring
the
matter
to
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
also
said
that
he
--
must
say
that
he
does
not
exactly
finish
in
the
state
agency,
he
had
to
file
a
claim
with
the
eeoc.
justice
byron
r.
white
let
us
go
back
to
what
you
said
that
eeoc
could
not
do;
treat
their
prior
claim
as
the
current
claim.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
it
is
definitely
why
difference
matter
though,
the
federal
agency
has
to
give
the
state
agency,
if
it
is
appropriate
for
the
federal
agency
to
accept
the
employee’s
complaint.
it
may
not
enact
on
it
until
it
has
given
the
state
agency
an
opportunity
to
act
on
it
and
that
the
60
day
period,
that
is
only
up
to
state
agency
does
nothing
within
60
days
that
the
federal
agency
may
then
rule,
is
not
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
first
of
all
it
requires
the
exhaustion
of
the
state
remedies
to
that
extent.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
it
congressionally
require
the
exhaustion
for
60
days.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
lawrence,
what
would
the
reference
manipulate
the
filing
date?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
that
suppose
to
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
excuse
me,
would
you
just
bring
me
up
to
date.
when
is
it
that
the
employee
after
eeoc
finally
has
acted
on
this
case,
may
go
on
to
federal
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
30
days,
whatever
it
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
according
to
you
he
has
never
filed
before.
he
does
not
even
file
it
again
because
he
has
never
filed.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
mean
he
has
never
filed
a
corpus
charge
with
the
federal
authority
because
he
filed
it
before
he
went
to
the
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
eppich,
in
this
case
when
he
came
back
from
the
state,
well,
he
did
not
come
back
from
the
state
--
justice
byron
r.
white
he
did
not
comeback
from
the
state
but
the
federal
people
revived
the
old
charge
should
i
take
it,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
started
moving
anyway,
did
not
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
something.
now,
let
us
assume
for
the
moment
they
moved
on
the
old
charge
that
had
been
filed,
and
you
say
that
would
be
wrong
under
the
plain
words
of
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
in
the
alternative
however,
if
they
had
sat
down
and
talked
about
it,
they
would
not
need
to
have
moved
on
the
old
charge
at
all,
a
member
of
the
commission
could
have
filed
the
charge?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
that
point,
without
hearing
a
word
from
the
employee?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
had
already
been
to
the
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
will
you
think
if
a
member
of
the
commission
had
wanted
to
sentence
him
down
after
the
state
had
disposed
off
this
claim
and
file
a
charge
except
you
to
have
even
not
with
the
identical
charge,
he
would
have
to
take
it
to
the
state
first?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
like
it
was
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
form
of
the
prior
complaint?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
that,
did
they
admit
that
charge
although
it
had
been
filed
within
the

before
going

justice
byron

white
eeoc.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
must
be
a
complaint
before
the
eeoc
can
act
and
that
is
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
the
complaint
must
by
the
aggrieved
employee?
justice
byron

well,
is

justice

what
is
that?
is
that
60
days?
justice
byron

the
state
proceeding
may
go
on
intermittently
--
justice
byron

in

words,
60
days
after
the
employee
has
gone
to
