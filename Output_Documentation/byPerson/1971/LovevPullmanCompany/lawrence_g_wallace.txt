may
it
please
the
court.
title
vii
of
the
’64
act
was
a
product
of
legislative
compromise
and
accommodation
in
which
congress
stressed
voluntarily
compliance
by
assigning
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission,
the
role
of
attempting
conciliation
but
also
conferred
a
right
on
the
complainant
to
sue
in
a
federal
court
if
the
commission's
efforts
were
unsuccessful
and
this
was
layered
over
by
another
legislative
compromise
to
give
state
and
local
employment
commissions
where
they
exist
an
opportunity
to
attempt
first
to
resolve
the
complaint
locally,
while
preserving
that
reasonable
process
of
the
complainants
federal
remedies.
and
one
result
of
these
compromises
is
the
uncommonly
complex
procedural
provisions
of
section
706,
set
forth
in
our
brief
on
pages
32
through
35.
and
the
act
intended
beneficiaries
as
has
already
been
said
are
lay
working
men
and
women,
many
of
whom
are
unlettered
and
uncounseled
in
attempting
to
pursue
these
remedies.
accordingly,
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
and
most
federal
courts
have
from
the
outset
taken
the
view
that
the
procedural
requirements
of
section
706
should
be
applied
so
as
to
accomplish
in
substance
the
various
policies
of
the
federal
statute
but
not
in
a
way
that
imposes
unnecessary
obstacles
to
the
ultimate
determination
of
the
merits
of
complaints
made
in
good
faith.
the
problem
of
this
application
has
arisen
in
various
contexts
discussed
in
our
brief.
some
of
these
arose
because
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
which
under
its
appropriations,
has
never
been
generously
staffed
and
still
is
not,
quickly
develop
a
sizable
backlog
of
cases
which
is
still
growing.
there
have
been
imperfections
and
some
inconsistencies
in
the
commission’s
application
of
this
procedural
requirements
particularly
in
the
early
years
but
we
believe
its
basic
approach
has
been
sound
one.
indeed,
the
act
itself
specifically
authorizes
the
commission
to
adopt
procedural
regulations.
this
is
in
section
713(a)
which
is
set
forth
on
page
35
of
our
brief.
and
the
adoption
of
such
regulations
is
particularly
appropriate
with
respect
to
the
procedural
matter
involved
here,
the
receipt
of
the
complaint
initially
by
the
eeoc
when
there
is
a
state
agency
to
whom
it
must
first
be
referred
because
the
act,
despite
the
detail
of
procedural
complexity
does
not
speak
to
the
question
of
what
the
eeoc
should
do
when
it
received
the
complaint
initially
in
such
a
situation.
and
so,
bearing
in
mind
all
of
the
policies
of
the
act,
especially
the
overall
of
policy
of
preserving
a
federal
remedy
on
the
merits
ultimately
in
federal
court,
eeoc
has
adopted
this
policy
of
referring
such
complaint
to
the
appropriate
state
agency
under
regulations
duly
adopted.
the
regulation
is
within
effect
at
time
of
this
complaint
was
a
generally
worded
regulation
set
forth
on
page
38
of
our
brief.
that
regulation
has
since
been
refined
and
elaborated
and
the
new
regulation
begins
on
page
36
of
our
brief.
i
think
it
is
worthwhile
to
look
for
just
a
moment
on
page
36
at
subsection
a
of
that
regulations
in
which
the
commission
recites
some
of
the
reasoning
behind
the
regulation
particularly
in
the
last
two
sentences
of
that
subsection,
the
commission
stated
“it
is
the
experience
of
the
commission
that
because
of
the
complexities
of
the
present
procedures,
persons
who
seeks
the
aid
of
the
commission
are
often
confused
and
even
risk
loss
protection
of
the
act.
accordingly,
it
is
the
intent
of
the
commission
to
simplify
filing
procedures
for
parties
in
deferral
states
and
localities
and
thereby
avoid
the
accidental
forfeiture
of
important
federal
rights.
but
in
the
previous
part
of
the
paragraph,
the
commission
also
recites
that
its
purpose
is
to
encourage
the
maximum
degree
of
effectiveness
in
the
state
and
local
agencies,
also
in
accordance
with
congressional
intent
under
section
706.
now,
we
believe
that
this
practice
which
the
commission
has
developed
is
a
valid
procedure
under
the
act
and
under
the
commissions
regulations
both
those
existing
at
the
time
in
the
present
regulation.
the
court
of
appeals,
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals,
believed
in
its
word
that
the
commission
could
not
manipulate
the
filing
dates
in
this
fashion.
this
meant
that
there
were
two
possible
defects
as
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
saw
it,
i
think
this
is
already
been
brought
out;
one
would
be
that
rather
than
have
the
commission
refer
the
complaint
to
the
colorado
agency,
mr.
love
should
have
been
told
to
file
a
complaint
and
solve
with
the
colorado
agency
when
the
commission
received
the
complaint.
we
hardly
see
that
this
would
make
a
substantial
difference
in
the
case.
the
colorado
agency
quickly
indicated
that
it
was
waiving
its
jurisdiction
having
previously
failed
to
satisfy
mr.
love.
the
other
possible
defect
under
the
majority
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
that
after
the
commission
received
word
from
the
colorado
agency
that
it
was
waiving
its
jurisdiction,
it
should
have
asked
mr.
love
to
file
another
form
of
complaint
within
thirty
days
even
though
he
had
just
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
was
what
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
complained
of
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
do
not
quite
understand
the
opinion
ourselves.
as
far
as
we
can
see,
it
is
referring
to
one
of
these
two
possible
defects;
that
treating
the
letter
previously
received
is
having
them
filed
after
the
waiver
of
jurisdiction,
apparently
was
a
manipulation
of
the
filing
date
in
view
of
the
majority.
that
letter
was
received
only
a
week
prior
to
words
from
the
colorado
commission
that
it
was
waving
its
jurisdiction
so
that
it
hardly
seems
a
very
serious
question
whether
mr.
love
still
would
want
eeoc
to
proceed.
we
believe
the
procedure
that
was
followed
was
a
valid
procedure
and
honored
all
of
the
policies
of
the
act
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thirty
days
after
he
received
words
from
eeoc.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
right,
and
we
also
specify
in
our
brief
that
even
if
the
eeoc
procedure
is
not
valid,
we
still
believe
that
under
the
policy
of
the
federal
act,
eeocs
in
the
state
should
not
file
relief
for
the
employee
as
we
have
elaborated
both
in
this
brief
and
the
brief
we
filed
last
term
in
the
crosland
case
at
the
invitation
of
the
court.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
respond
to
two
points
that
are
arisen
in
the
questioning.
first,
this
record
does
not
show
the
manner
in
which
the
referral
was
made
by
eeoc
to
the
colorado
commission
in
1966.
this
referral
was
made
during
the
first
year
of
the
administration
of
title
vii
and
the
procedures
at
that
time
were
not
as
regularized
as
they
are
now.
but
what
the
record
does
show
on
page
8
of
the
appendix
is
the
colorado
commission
responds
to
that
referral.
that
responds
says
specifically
that
the
case
of
mr.
love
has
come
to
the
commission’s
attention,
the
colorado
commission’s
attention
and
in
the
last
paragraph
of
that
letter,
it
seems
quite
clear
that
the
colorado
commission
treated
the
referral
whatever
matter
it
was
made
in
as
adequate
to
invoke
its
jurisdiction.
the
colorado
commission
said
under
the
circumstances,
we
could
not
in
good
conscience
accept
the
60
day
deferment
period
and
accordingly
waive
it.
will
you
proceed,
speaking
to
the
eeoc
under
the
provisions
of
title
vii,
to
give
any
relief
that
you
can
to
mr.
love.
now,
i
see
nothing
in
the
federal
act
that
prohibits
this
state
from
treating
a
referral
or
an
oral
complaint
of
any
kind,
in
whatever
matter
made
as
adequate
to
invoke
the
state’s
jurisdiction.
this
is
the
matter
for
the
state
agency
to
decide
the
matter
of
state
law
whether
its
jurisdiction
was
invoked.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
record
does
not
show
it
but
this
letter
shows
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
this
letter
showed
that
however
it
was
done
and
the
testimony
is
that
it
was
a
referral
from
the
eeoc
but
the
testimony
does
not
say
in
what
manner
or
i
think
the
letter
shows
that
however
it
was
done,
the
colorado
commission
treated
this
referral
as
adequate
to
invoke
this
response
that
it
was
waving
its
60
day
jurisdiction
under
the
statutory
deferral
period.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
right.
well,
that
is
what
it
has
under
the
title
vii,
it
has
60
days
before
eeoc
can
grant
it
sub-jurisdiction
and
it
is
waiving
that
period.
it
treated
its
jurisdiction
as
invoked
and
it
waived
its
jurisdiction.
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
federal
act
that
prevents
the
state
from
treating
that
referral
as
adequate
to
invoke
its
jurisdiction.
what
706b
says
that
if
the
state
agency
requires
more
than
just
a
simple
--?
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
our
position.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
our
position
your
honor.
we
do
not
believe
the
federal
statute
presumes
to
say
that
the
state
could
not
have
treated
this
as
the
adequate
invocation
of
its
jurisdiction.
it
does
in
706b
say
that
if
the
state
requires
too
much
that
a
merely
written
complaint
dating
back
will
be
treated
as
having
been
adequate
for
purposes
if
that
invoke
in
the
federal
remedy.
and
the
other
point
i
wish
to
respond
to
is
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
question
about
whether
the
pullman
company
has
been
prejudiced.
judge
seth
(ph)
own
opinion
on
rehearing,
he
states
the
record
shows
that
the
colorado
commission
in
the
1965
proceeding
discussed
the
complaint
with
the
pullman
company.
they
have
had
noted
that
at
least
since,
shortly
before
the
federal
act
became
effective
of
mr.
love’s
complaint
and
any
lapse
of
time
that
occurred
thereafter,
is
attributable
to
the
fact
that
the
company
was
unwilling
to
give
re-dress
and
so
we
ask
the
court
to
remand
this
case
for
hearing
on
the
merits
of
this
long
standing
complaint
of
mr.
love.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.

the
colorado
agency
quickly
indicated
that
it
was
waiving
its

having
previously

the
other
possible
defect
under

was
that
after

complained
of
--
mr.

well,
we
do
not

as
far
as
we
can
see,
it
is
referring
to
one
of
these
two
possible
defects;
that
treating
the

previously

having
them

the
waiver
of

apparently
was
a

of
the

in

of
the

that
letter
was
received
only
a
week
prior
to
words
from
the
colorado
commission
that
it
was
waving
its

so
that
it
hardly
seems
a
very
serious
question
whether
mr.
love
still
would
want
eeoc
to
proceed.
we
believe
the
procedure
that
was
followed
was
a
valid
procedure
and
honored
all
of
the
policies
of
the
act
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thirty
days
after
he
received
words
from
eeoc.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
right,
and
we
also
specify
in
our
brief
that
even
if
the
eeoc
procedure
is
not
valid,
we
still
believe
that
under
the
policy
of
the
federal
act,
eeocs
in
the
state
should
not
file
relief
for
the
employee
as
we
have
elaborated
both
in
this
brief
and
the
brief
we
filed
last
term
in
the
crosland
case
at
the
invitation
of
the
court.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
respond
to
two
points
that
are
arisen
in
the
questioning.
first,
this
record
does
not
show
the
manner
in
which
the
referral
was
made
by
eeoc
to
the
colorado
commission
in
1966.
this
referral
was
made
during
the
first
year
of
the
administration
of
title
vii
and
the
procedures
at
that
time
were
not
as
regularized
as
they
are
now.
but
what
the
record
does
show
on
page
8
of
the
appendix
is
the
colorado
commission
responds
to
that
referral.
that
responds
says
specifically
that
the
case
of
mr.
love
has
come
to
the
commission’s
attention,
the
colorado
commission’s
attention
and
in
the
last
paragraph
of
that
letter,
it
seems
quite
clear
that
the
colorado
commission
treated
the
referral
whatever
matter
it
was
made
in
as
adequate
to
invoke
its
jurisdiction.
the
colorado
commission
said
under
the
circumstances,
we
could
not
in
good
conscience
accept
the
60
day
deferment
period
and
accordingly
waive
it.
will
you
proceed,
speaking
to
the
eeoc
under
the
provisions
of
title
vii,
to
give
any
relief
that
you
can
to
mr.
love.
now,
i
see
nothing
in
the
federal
act
that
prohibits
this
state
from
treating
a
referral
or
an
oral
complaint
of
any
kind,
in
whatever
matter
made
as
adequate
to
invoke
the
state’s
jurisdiction.
this
is
the
matter
for
the
state
agency
to
decide
the
matter
of
state
law
whether
its
jurisdiction
was
invoked.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
record
does
not
show
it
but
this
letter
shows
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
this
letter
showed
that
however
it
was
done
and
the
testimony
is
that
it
was
a
referral
from
the
eeoc
but
the
testimony
does
not
say
in
what
manner
or
i
think
the
letter
shows
that
however
it
was
done,
the
colorado
commission
treated
this
referral
as
adequate
to
invoke
this
response
that
it
was
waving
its
60
day
jurisdiction
under
the
statutory
deferral
period.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
right.
well,
that
is
what
it
has
under
the
title
vii,
it
has
60
days
before
eeoc
can
grant
it
sub-jurisdiction
and
it
is
waiving
that
period.
it
treated
its
jurisdiction
as
invoked
and
it
waived
its
jurisdiction.
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
federal
act
that
prevents
the
state
from
treating
that
referral
as
adequate
to
invoke
its
jurisdiction.
what
706b
says
that
if
the
state
agency
requires
more
than
just
a
simple
--?
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
our
position.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
our
position
your
honor.
we
do
not
believe
the
federal
statute
presumes
to
say
that
the
state
could
not
have
treated
this
as
the
adequate
invocation
of
its
jurisdiction.
it
does
in
706b
say
that
if
the
state
requires
too
much
that
a
merely
written
complaint
dating
back
will
be
treated
as
having
been
adequate
for
purposes
if
that
invoke
in
the
federal
remedy.
and
the
other
point
i
wish
to
respond
to
is
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
question
about
whether
the
pullman
company
has
been
prejudiced.
judge
seth
(ph)
own
opinion
on
rehearing,
he
states
the
record
shows
that
the
colorado
commission
in
the
1965
proceeding
discussed
the
complaint
with
the
pullman
company.
they
have
had
noted
that
at
least
since,
shortly
before
the
federal
act
became
effective
of
mr.
love’s
complaint
and
any
lapse
of
time
that
occurred
thereafter,
is
attributable
to
the
fact
that
the
company
was
unwilling
to
give
re-dress
and
so
we
ask
the
court
to
remand
this
case
for
hearing
on
the
merits
of
this
long
standing
complaint
of
mr.
love.
