justice

powell,
jr.
i'd
like
to
go
back
to
discussion
merely
as
to
the
distinction
you
draw
between
race
and
sex
as
a
basis
for
discrimination
and
i
have
in
mind
the
numerous
court
decisions
which
do
not
allow
states
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
sex
with
respect
to
admission
to
state
institutions,
schools
and
the
like.
is
it
your
position
that
a
club
could
discriminate,
a
men's
only
club
or
women's
only
club.
