mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
substantive
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
anything
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
requires
the
virtual
destruction
of
private
clubs
in
this
country.
but
before
i
can
reach
that
question,
the
rules
require
that
i
reach
the
jurisdictional
issue
which
the
court
postponed.
before
i
can
usefully
do
either,
i
must
re-sketch
the
facts.
appellant
moose
lodge
is
a
private
club
in
every
respect
and
the
parties
have
so
stipulated
in
detail.
it
has
selective
and
invitational
membership
procedures.
admission
to
the
club
house
is
restricted
to
members
and
their
guests.
it
has
never
received,
and
isn’t
now
receiving
any
public
funds.
it’s
club
house
is
not
located
on
public
property.
it
performs
no
public
functions.
it
conducts
no
community
activity.
it
has
never
ask
for
public
assistance
either
from
courts
or
police
in
the
conduct
of
it
affairs.
it's
never
sought
public
patronage
through
advertising.
it’s
not
a
recent
transformation.
there
is
no
sham
or
substitutes
here.
it
is
a
non-profit
corporation,
controlled
by
its
membership
and
the
object
of
its
bounty
are
mooseheart
which
is
an
orphanage
and
school
and
mooseheaven
which
is
a
home
for
the
elder.
now
here
is
all
that
moose
lodge
receives
from
public
bodies.
it
has
a
occupancy
permit
for
its
building.
it
has
an
operating
permit
for
its
elevator.
it
has
a
health
permit
for
its
restaurant.
it
gets
also
what
every
private
residents
within
the
city
limits
gets,
water,
steam
heat,
and
trash
removal
for
which
it
pays
and
it
has
a
club
liquor
license
from
the
commonwealth.
moose
lodge's
membership
is
restrictive
as
is
that
of
other
clubs
and
organizations
in
this
country
that
include
more
than
70,000,0000
americans.
restriction
are;
first
male,
second
caucasian
and
not
married
to
a
non
caucasian,
third
belief
in
the
supreme
being.
i
better
read
from
the
court's
findings
as
to
how
this
case
arose.
a
caucasian
member
in
good
standing
brought
plaintiff,
a
negro
to
the
lodge's
dining
room
and
bar
as
his
guest
and
requested
service
of
food
and
beverages.
the
lodge
through
its
employees
refused
service
to
plaintiff,
solely
because
he
is
a
negro.
there
upon,
the
plaintiff
mr.
irvis,
who
is
the
majority
leader
of
the
pennsylvania
house
of
representatives
brought
this
action
against
the
moose
lodge
and
the
members
of
the
pennsylvania
liquor
control
board,
alleging
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
pennsylvania
liquor
code
as
applied,
because
it
did
not
prohibit
the
issuance
of
club
licenses
to
clubs
with
racial
membership
restrictions.
the
three-judge
court
held
that
liquor
regulation
by
pennsylvania
was
so
pervasive
that
moose
lodge's
membership
restrictions
were
there
by
transformed
into
state
action,
but
it
made
a
significant
qualification
which
i’d
better
read
in
preference
to
characterizing,
this
is
from
page
40
of
the
appendix.
nothing
in
what
we
hearsay
implies
a
judgment
on
private
clubs
which
limits
participation
to
those
of
a
shared
religious
affiliation
or
a
mutual
heritage
in
national
origin.
such
cases
are
not
the
same
as
the
present
one
where
discrimination
is
practiced
solely
on
racial
grounds
and
the
judgment
was
that
either
the
moose
lodge
had
to
drop
it’s
racial
restrictions
or
else
lose
its
liquor
license.
moose
lodge
moved
to
modify
that
judgment
so
as
to
permit
mr.
irvis
guest
privileges.
he
opposed
that
it
was
denied
by
the
court.
this
appeal
followed
and
your
honors
postponed
jurisdiction.
now
under
the
rules
i
must
argue
that
jurisdictional
point
first.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
that
is
at
page
42
of
the
appendix.
there
is
an
answer
at
page
44
and
the
motion
was
denied.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
permit
any
member
to
bring
mr.
irvis
in
as
a
guest.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
anybody
similarly
situated.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes.
now
one
of
the
points
on
which
we
agree
with
irvis
is
that
the
complaint
did
in
did
state
a
cause
of
action
within
the
jurisdiction
of
a
three-judge
court
because
it
is
an
action
to
enjoin
state
wide
legislation
on
the
ground
that
as
applied,
it
denied
the
plaintiff
the
equal
protection
of
the
law.
now
it's
just
not
like
that
texas
university
case
where
the
legislation
wasn’t
a
state
wide
application.
it
wasn’t
like
that
native
american
church
case
where
some
of
the
members
of
the
court
couldn’t
find
an
allegation
of
unconstitutionality.
here
that
allegation
was
made.
i
don’t
think
it
would
be
proper
to
both
or
helpful
to
the
court
for
me
to
discuss
the
cases
in
detail,
they
are
all
set
out
in
our
break.
we
think
that
even
though
jurisdiction
originally
attached
and
of
course
the
touch
tone
is
the
compliant,
it
was
thereafter
laws
and
it
is
our
view
that
there
is
no
present
case
for
controversy
because
the
decree
gives
irvis
no
personal
redress,
but
to
the
contrary
is
a
judgment
punitive
in
character
and
legislative
in
it’s
application.
now
they
stipulated
that
the
loss
of
a
liquor
license
would
seriously
impair
moose
lodge's
ability
to
contribute
to
the
benevolent
purposes
of
the
supreme
lodge.
irvis
didn’t
ask
for
damages,
he
did
not
sue
as
a
tax
payer,
he
didn’t
bring
a
class
action,
he
doesn’t
seek
membership.
he
repeatedly
conceded
here
and
below
the
right
of
the
moose
lodge
to
exclude
him,
and
he
repeatedly
said
that
there
was
nothing
illegal
in
its
doing
so
and
he
rejected
modification
of
the
judgment
which
would
have
let
him
in
as
a
guest.
so
that
all
he
wants
is
to
have
the
moose
lodge
lose
its
liquor
license
and
we
say
he
has
no
personal
stake
in
that
anymore
than
any
of
the
12,000,000
other
inhabitants
of
the
county.
so
that
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes,
your
honor,
and
having
done
our
duty
by
raising
the
jurisdictional
question,
i
ask
for
the
substantive
issue.
by
way
of
essential
preliminary,
i
must
deal
with
the
district
court's
suggestion
that
there
is
somehow
a
difference
between
racial
restrictions
on
the
one
hand
and
religious
or
ethnic
restrictions
on
the
other.
now
that,
to
put
it
most
gently
is
completely
mistaken.
there
is
no
constitutional
distinction
whatever
between
state
action
that
discriminates
either
on
races
--
racial
or
religious
or
ethnic
grounds.
it
is
simply
not
true
that
the
constitution
sustains
the
anti
semi
while
denouncing
the
anti
hemi
(ph).
it
is
simply
not
true
that
some
groups
are
entitled
to
more
equal
protection
than
others.
what
this
purported
distinction
really
does
is
picking
and
choosing
among
association
and
groups
on
the
bases
of
their
beliefs
and
preference
which
seems
to
me
a
most
glaring
denial
of
due
process
because
all
three
restrictions
are
equally
bad
if
the
membership
requirements
are
indeed
state
action
and
interestingly
enough
that
is
the
one
of
the
few
points
on
which
the
attorney
general
of
the
commonwealth
agrees
with
us.
he
says
they
are
all
equally
bad.
therefore,
if
the
private
club
with
the
racial
restriction
can't
have
a
liquor
license
because
those
restrictions
are
state
action,
then
either
can
any
other
private
club
with
religious
or
ethnic
distinctions.
so
that
if
the
judgment
below
is
correct,
scores
of
millions
of
americans
now
associated
in
all
manner
of
private
clubs
can't
have
liquor
licenses
either
and
since
precedents
invariably
build
on
each
other,
the
next
will
be
they
will
risk
losing
building
permits,
restaurant
permits
and
all
the
rest.
irvis
says
they
are
all
different,
but
there
is
a
main
statue
that
makes
the
racially
restricted
club
lose
its
restaurant
permit
also,
while
not
taking
it
away
from
the
religiously
or
ethnically
restrictive
club.
fortunately
for
the
continued
pluralistic
existence
of
the
republic
and
the
elks'
brief
amicus
documents
this
statement
that
we
are
indeed
a
nation
of
jointness.
the
decision
below
is
wrong
for
three
separate
reasons
which
i
shall
discuss
in
order.
first,
the
first
amendment
right
of
associational
privacy
protects
private
clubs
and
fraternal
organizations
from
any
and
all
state
efforts,
directed
at
the
full
exercise
and
joined
under
that
right.
second,
the
issuance
of
a
liquor
license
does
not
and
cannot
transform
the
acts
of
the
licensee
into
those
of
the
licensing
authority
and
three,
congress
in
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
has
twice
drawn
a
line
between
these
apparently
competing
constitutional
rights
by
accepting
from
the
public
accommodations
title,
private
clubs
not
in
fact
open
to
the
public
and
by
forbidding
the
civil
rights
commission
from
investigating
the
membership
practices
and
the
internal
operations,
both
of
private
clubs
and
a
fraternal
organization
and
i
will
take
first
the
right
of
associational
privacy
which
it
seems
to
us
can
be
viewed
in
either
negatively
or
affirmatively.
negatively
it
is
the
proposition
that
social
rights
are
not
enforceable
in
the
courts
or
by
law
and
for
this
proposition
i
draw
on
the
dissenting
opinion
of
the
elder
justice
harlan
in
the
civil
rights
cases.
i
better
give
that
citation
because
it
is
not
in
brief,
109
us
at
59.
i
agree
that
government
has
nothing
to
do
with
social
as
distinguished
from
technically
legal
rights
of
individuals.
no
government
has
ever
brought
or
ever
can
bring
its
people
into
social
intercourse
against
their
wishes.
whether
one
person
will
permit
or
maintain
social
relations
with
another
is
a
matter
with
which
government
has
no
concern
i
agree
that
if
one
citizen
chooses
not
to
hold
social
intercourse
with
another,
he
is
not
and
cannot
be
made
amenable
to
the
law
for
his
conduct
in
that
regard.
for
even
upon
grounds
of
race,
no
legal
right
of
the
citizen
is
violated
by
the
refusal
of
others
to
maintain
nearly
social
relations
with
it.
now
that
as
i
had
indicated
is
a
dissenting
opinion,
but
it
is
in
an
area
where
the
dissents
of
the
elder
justice
harlan
have
now
moral
weight
than
those
of
the
court.
affirmatively
there
is
a
right
of
constitutional
right
of
liberty
of
association
which
is
documented
by
many
decisions
of
this
court
and
which
amounts
to
this
that
in
my
home
and
in
my
club
and
in
my
chose
of
business
associates,
i
can
act
on
my
prejudice
as
even
those
of
race,
i
--
they
can
--
my
preferences
maybe
enlightened,
they
maybe
eccentric,
they
may
be
bigoted,
they
may
represent
prejudices,
they
may
represent
postjudices,
but
in
my
private
domain,
i
can
exclude
whom
i
want
and
for
any
reasons
and
as
indicated
there
is
no
doubt
here.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
think
very
clearly
so
on
the
analogy
that
we
used
in
the
brief
where
the
it
was
the
doctrine
of
unconstitutional
conditions.
your
honor
will
recall
anti
removal
statutes.
well
the
basis,
the
rationality
for
striking
down
those
statures
was
that
the
state
cannot
interfere
with
the
exercise
of
a
federally
guaranteed
right,
so
that
the
answer
is,
the
short
answer
your
honor
is
yes.
the
state
can
interfere
the
right
to
pick
ones
associates
from
among
those
like
minded
is
an
area
beyond
governmental
cognizance
and
the
result
below
really
strikes
a
wounding
blow
at
human
types.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
if
that
private
i
would,
definitely,
definitely
because
if
it
is
private
you
can
discriminate.
if
it
is
a
public
place,
no,
fairly
not,
but
this
is
private,
this
is
--
the
club
is
just
an
extension
of
the
home
and
evidently
knew
--
the
court
said
that
if
you
have
a
golf
club
that
is
all
white
or
a
golf
club
that
is
all
black,
that
is
the
right
of
private
association,
but
if
you
have
a
municipal
golf
course
then
you
cannot
discriminate.
so
i
would
say
as
long
as
long
as
it
is
private,
you
can’t
--
the
state
can't
--
can
no
more
lift
the
license
of
moose
because
it
is
limited
to
caucasians
only
or
to
those
who
aren’t
agnostics
or
aliens,
and
it
can
lift
the
license
of
the
knights
of
columbus
council
which
is
restricted
as
i
am
told
to
practice
in
catholic
or
the
liquor
license
of
the
knights
of
peter
claver,
who
are
black
male
and
catholics,
so
if
it
is
a
boa
fide,
a
private
club
and
of
course
i
am
excluding
the
shams
and
subterfuges
and
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
it
would.
there
isn’t
much
deference
because
your
honor,
once
you
say
that
the
liquor
license
is
special,
we
get
to
the
restaurant
license.
now
my
brother
says
that
the
restaurant
license
is
different.
the
state
of
maine
says
no.
irvis
in
his
last
brief
espouses
the
proposition
from
a
recent
three-judge
court
case
that
anybody
who
discriminates
can't
have
solace
from
the
government.
well,
that
means
that
where
you
cut
of
the
water
because
how
many
--
how
many
homes
in
this
country
get
water
from
other
than
public
body
and
you
would
cut
of
power
in
large
parts
of
the
west,
urban
and
rural
because
of
the
vast
proliferation
of
municipal
power
plants.
so
that
if
you
can
cut
of
a
liquor
license,
you
can
step
by
step
cut
of
all
the
rest,
if
you
agree
with
three-judge
district
court
that
no
discrimination
can
receive
any
solace
and
i
want
to
emphasis,
there
is
no
difference
between
racial,
religious
or
ethnic
because
after
all
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
i
have
three
positions
and
the
second
one
is
which
i'll
--
one
is
the
affirmative
right
to
privacy
and
the
inability
of
law
or
government
to
dictate
social
relations.
the
second
is,
the
second
proposition
for
reversal
is
that
the
issuance
of
a
license
doesn’t
transform
or
transmute
or
metamorphoses
the
acts
of
the
licensee
into
those
of
the
licensesor.
i
want
to
emphasis
the
shaky
and
indeed
sandy
foundation
on
which
the
notion
of
state
action
was
directed
in
this
case.
a
caucasian
member
in
good
standing
brought
plaintiff,
a
negro
to
the
lodge's
dinning
room
and
bar
as
his
guest,
requested
service
of
food
and
beverages.
the
lodge
through
its
employees
refused
service
to
plaintiff,
solely
because
he
was
a
negro.
well,
this
is
an
action
against
the
liquor
control
board
to
remove,
lift
the
liquor
license.
what
did
the
liquor
control
board
had
to
do
with
refusal
to
serve
food
and
there
is
nothing
in
this
finding
by
the
court
that
says
that
the
commonwealth
had
anything
to
do
with
this
refusal
of
service
because
after
all
you
can't
hardly
exist
now
a
days
without
some
kind
of
whole
series
of
licenses
from
state
and
federal
authority.
now
if
i
may
interject
a
personal
note,
i
need
four
licenses
to
be
here
at
this
elect
and
speaking
to
your
honors.
first
i
had
to
be
admitted
to
a
state
court,
then
i
have
to
be
admitted
here,
then
i
have
to
be
admitted
in
the
district
and
now
every
year
i
have
to
pay
professional
license
fee
to
the
district
to
be
able
to
practice
my
profession
and
gain
my
livelihood.
if
you
drive
an
auto
on
the
highway,
you
need
a
driving
license,
you
need
a
car
registration
and
in
many
perhaps
most
states,
you
need
an
annual
safety
inspection.
if
you
operate
a
teetotaler
club
or
a
locker
system
club,
you
need
an
occupancy
permit,
an
elevator
permit
and
a
restaurant
permit.
now
those
essential
licenses
don’t
turn
the
lawyer
or
driver
into
a
public
utility
who
is
required
to
serve
all
commerce
and
those
licenses
don’t
turn
a
private
club
into
a
place
of
public
accommodation.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
am
told
that
having
a
bottle,
well
--
i
am
told
that
having
a
locker
system,
that
is
every
member
having
his
stick
or
stock
of
liquor
in
your
locker,
not
selling
liquor,
not
buying
liquor
from
the
club
that
that
would
not
require
a
liquor
license.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes
but
the
state
doesn’t
say
that
if
you
buy
a
bottle
of
old
overholt
and
take
it
to
your
home,
you
can
exclude
people
you
don’t
like
or
prefer
not
to
associate.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
that
is
the
extent
to
which
you
would
go
and
the
--
the
irrationality
of
the
decision
becomes
apparent
when
you
look
at
some
of
the
other
restrictions.
now
there
as
regulation
119
deals
with
sacramental
lines
--
wines.
by
parity
of
reasoning
that
would
be
unconstitutional
support
of
religion
and
we
think
that
there
just
isn't
any
state
action
here
because
of
any
--
as
i
have
said
it's
benefit,
if
any
benefit
is
a
touch
tone,
nobody
can
have
electric
light
or
electric
power
if
you
discriminate
in
you
home.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
exactly.
in
other
words,
the
position
we
take
on
that
is
the
position
that
your
honor
and
justice
black
and
justice
harlan
took
in
bell
against
maryland,
that
you
can’t
attribute
to
the
licensing
authority
a
discriminatory
acts
on
the
part
of
licensees
is
too
big
of
a
jump.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
your
honor,
i
am
not
an
expert
of
liquor
regulation
in
the
several
states,
but
if
you
--
if
you
say
that
pennsylvania
is
so
pervasive,
you
got
to
have
to
test
the
other
50
states
to
see
whether
there
are
differences.
now
the
notion
that
the
-
the
court
below
espoused
that
it
was
liquor
regulation
was
more
continues
that
other
regulations,
the
bar
isn’t
regulated
anymore
continuously
than
the
restaurant
and
as
for
the
so
called
pervasive
regulation
what
is
pervasive.
look
at
building
codes,
look
at
building
codes.
this
is
the
pennsylvania
liquor
code,
this
is
the
building
official's
conference
of
america
basic
voca,
basic
building
code.
my
figures
are
that
some
800
municipalities
have
adopted
these
codes
in
full
or
in
part.
now,
i
don’t
think
that
one
is
more
pervasive
than
the
other
and
i
think
you
going
to
have
an
awful
time
if
you
are
going
to
try
to
compare
every
area
of
regulation
against
liquor
regulation
to
see
whether
one
is
or
is
not
pervasive.
i
just
think
that
to
say
that
the
pervasiveness
of
a
regulation
transforms
the
acts
of
the
licensee
into
those
of
the
licensing
authority
is
just
to
rewrite
the
constitution.
now,
the
constitution
says
no
state,
no
state
shall
deny
to
any
person
within
its
jurisdiction
the
equal
protection
of
laws.
it
doesn’t
say
no
person
licensed
by
a
state,
it
doesn’t
say
no
person
pervasively
licensed
by
a
state
and
indeed
your
honors
our
entire
recent
constitutional
history
warns
against
two
great
departures
from
the
text.
take
liberty
of
contract.
what
a
sorry
chapter
that
was
from
lochner
v.
new
york
through
morehead
against
tipaldo
or
take
the
immunity
of
governmental
instrumentality
which
--
which
emphasis
the
value
of
looking
to
the
text
rather
than
its
exajesus.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
when
that
doctrine
was
overruled
said
this.
the
judicial
history
of
this
doctrine
of
immunity
is
a
striking
illustration
of
an
occasional
tendency
to
encrust
on
wide
interpretations
upon
the
constitution
and
thereafter
to
consider
merely
what
has
been
judicially
said
about
the
constitution
rather
than
to
be
primarily
controlled
by
a
fair
conception
of
the
constitution.
judicial
exajesus
is
unavoidable
with
reference
to
an
organic
act
like
our
constitution,
drawn
in
many
particulars
with
purpose
of
vagueness
so
as
to
live
room
for
the
unfolding
future.
but
the
ultimate
touch
stone
of
constitutionality
is
the
constitution
itself
and
not
what
we
have
set
about
and
the
constitution
says
no
state.
now
the
third
ground
for
reversal
is
the
congressional
action
in
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
there
are
two
previsions.
first,
is
section
203e
which
exempts
from
the
operation
of
the
public
accommodations
title,
private
clubs
that
are
not
in
fact
open
to
the
public
and
then
perhaps
even
more
significantly
the
section
504a
which
forbids
the
civil
rights
commission
from
examining
the
membership
practices
and
the
internal
operation
of
private
clubs
and
fraternal
organizations
and
that
is
the
commission
as
your
honors
please
that
congress
directed
to
collect
information
concerning
the
denial
of
equal
protection
and
the
weren’t
to
look
into
private
clubs.
congress,
as
the
legislative
history
shows
wanted
to
protect
the
constitutional
right
of
private
association
from
interference
by
the
commission
and
that
is
clear
from
the
legislative
history.
finally,
there
is
a
thirteenth
amendment
point
which
has
been
raised
up
to
page
39,
of
his
brief
here,
irvis
said
the
injury
suffered
by
irvis
was
not
just
that
a
private
organization
barred
him
because
he
was
black.
this,
it
was
entitled
to
do,
but
70
pages
later
he
contents
that
to
have
bargained
was
a
badge
or
incident
of
slavery.
well,
now
that
is
just
doesn’t
wash
because
the
moose
restriction
is
caucasians
only.
that
bars
american
indians.
american
indians
not
only
weren't
never
systematically
enslaved,
but
they
had
negro
slaves
of
their
own.
the
freed
men
of
choctaw
and
chickasaw
and
seminole
nations,
so
that
clearly
caucasians
only
is
not
badge
or
incident
of
slavery.
so
that
we
say
a
jurisdiction
isn’t
lost
or
if
it
can't
be
regained
by
a
memo,
the
judgment
below
must
be
reversed
with
directions
to
dismiss
for
failure
to
safeguard
(inaudible).
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
mr.
chief
justice,
yes,
your
honor.
i
want
to
address
my
self
to
worthy
norms.
the
recognition
of
the
right
of
privacy
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
worthiness
or
unworthiness
of
the
associational
rights
sought
to
be
protected.
us
against
roble,
389
us
held
that
roble's
constitutional
right
of
association
in
this
instance
to
be
a
member
of
the
communist
party
prevail
over
the
congressional
probation
of
his
being
employed
in
the
defense
panel.
i
take
that
decision
did
not
mean
that
the
court
was
endorsing
the
norms
of
the
communist
party,
much
less
saying
that
they
were
worthy
norms
and
the
same
thing
here.
whatever
the
moose
restrictions
are
worthy
or
otherwise
is
not
my
concern.
it
is
their’s.
they
have
the
right
to
privacy
and
i
want
to
emphasis
that
when
they
say
caucasians
only,
it
isn't
any
worst
than
saying
any
one
of
20
european
nationalities
because
there
are
aren’t
black
swiss,
there
are
aren’t
black
swedes,
there
are
aren’t
black
english
and
except
in
the
pejorative
sense
there
are
aren’t
black
irish.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
it
is
not
restrictive
to
someone
who
hails
from
the
region
of
the
caucasus
mountains
and
it's
seems
to
me
that
insofar
as
there
seem
to
be
conflicting
interests
involved,
congress
has
drawn
the
line
in
two
provisions
of
the
civil
rights
act
and
it
is
our
view
if
you
are
going
to
respect.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes,
your
honor.
203e
on
private
clubs,
504a
on
limiting
the
civil
rights
commission
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
are
going
to
support
the
congressional
determination
and
the
enforcement
of
the
both
civil
war
amendments
to
permit
to
illiterates
to
vote
because
that
is
a
congressional
determination,
i
think
you
should
give
at
least
equal
weight
to
the
congressional
determination
that
private
clubs
and
fraternal
organizations
are
beyond
the
reach
of
government.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
substantive
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
anything
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
requires
the
virtual
destruction
of
private
clubs
in
this
country.
but
before
i
can
reach
that
question,
the
rules
require
that
i
reach
the
jurisdictional
issue
which
the
court
postponed.
before
i
can
usefully
do
either,
i
must
re-sketch
the
facts.
appellant
moose
lodge
is
a
private
club
in
every
respect
and
the
parties
have
so
stipulated
in
detail.
it
has
selective
and
invitational
membership
procedures.
admission
to
the
club
house
is
restricted
to
members
and
their
guests.
it
has
never
received,
and
isn’t
now
receiving
any
public
funds.
it’s
club
house
is
not
located
on
public
property.
it
performs
no
public
functions.
it
conducts
no
community
activity.
it
has
never
ask
for
public
assistance
either
from
courts
or
police
in
the
conduct
of
it
affairs.
it's
never
sought
public
patronage
through
advertising.
it’s
not
a
recent
transformation.
there
is
no
sham
or
substitutes
here.
it
is
a
non-profit
corporation,
controlled
by
its
membership
and
the
object
of
its
bounty
are
mooseheart
which
is
an
orphanage
and
school
and
mooseheaven
which
is
a
home
for
the
elder.
now
here
is
all
that
moose
lodge
receives
from
public
bodies.
it
has
a
occupancy
permit
for
its
building.
it
has
an
operating
permit
for
its
elevator.
it
has
a
health
permit
for
its
restaurant.
it
gets
also
what
every
private
residents
within
the
city
limits
gets,
water,
steam
heat,
and
trash
removal
for
which
it
pays
and
it
has
a
club
liquor
license
from
the
commonwealth.
moose
lodge's
membership
is
restrictive
as
is
that
of
other
clubs
and
organizations
in
this
country
that
include
more
than
70,000,0000
americans.
restriction
are;
first
male,
second
caucasian
and
not
married
to
a
non
caucasian,
third
belief
in
the
supreme
being.
i
better
read
from
the
court's
findings
as
to
how
this
case
arose.
a
caucasian
member
in
good
standing
brought
plaintiff,
a
negro
to
the
lodge's
dining
room
and
bar
as
his
guest
and
requested
service
of
food
and
beverages.
the
lodge
through
its
employees
refused
service
to
plaintiff,
solely
because
he
is
a
negro.
there
upon,
the
plaintiff
mr.
irvis,
who
is
the
majority
leader
of
the
pennsylvania
house
of
representatives
brought
this
action
against
the
moose
lodge
and
the
members
of
the
pennsylvania
liquor
control
board,
alleging
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
pennsylvania
liquor
code
as
applied,
because
it
did
not
prohibit
the
issuance
of
club
licenses
to
clubs
with
racial
membership
restrictions.
the
three-judge
court
held
that
liquor
regulation
by
pennsylvania
was
so
pervasive
that
moose
lodge's
membership
restrictions
were
there
by
transformed
into
state
action,
but
it
made
a
significant
qualification
which
i’d
better
read
in
preference
to
characterizing,
this
is
from
page
40
of
the
appendix.
nothing
in
what
we
hearsay
implies
a
judgment
on
private
clubs
which
limits
participation
to
those
of
a
shared
religious
affiliation
or
a
mutual
heritage
in
national
origin.
such
cases
are
not
the
same
as
the
present
one
where
discrimination
is
practiced
solely
on
racial
grounds
and
the
judgment
was
that
either
the
moose
lodge
had
to
drop
it’s
racial
restrictions
or
else
lose
its
liquor
license.
moose
lodge
moved
to
modify
that
judgment
so
as
to
permit
mr.
irvis
guest
privileges.
he
opposed
that
it
was
denied
by
the
court.
this
appeal
followed
and
your
honors
postponed
jurisdiction.
now
under
the
rules
i
must
argue
that
jurisdictional
point
first.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
that
is
at
page
42
of
the
appendix.
there
is
an
answer
at
page
44
and
the
motion
was
denied.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
permit
any
member
to
bring
mr.
irvis
in
as
a
guest.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
anybody
similarly
situated.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes.
now
one
of
the
points
on
which
we
agree
with
irvis
is
that
the
complaint
did
in
did
state
a
cause
of
action
within
the
jurisdiction
of
a
three-judge
court
because
it
is
an
action
to
enjoin
state
wide
legislation
on
the
ground
that
as
applied,
it
denied
the
plaintiff
the
equal
protection
of
the
law.
now
it's
just
not
like
that
texas
university
case
where
the
legislation
wasn’t
a
state
wide
application.
it
wasn’t
like
that
native
american
church
case
where
some
of
the
members
of
the
court
couldn’t
find
an
allegation
of
unconstitutionality.
here
that
allegation
was
made.
i
don’t
think
it
would
be
proper
to
both
or
helpful
to
the
court
for
me
to
discuss
the
cases
in
detail,
they
are
all
set
out
in
our
break.
we
think
that
even
though
jurisdiction
originally
attached
and
of
course
the
touch
tone
is
the
compliant,
it
was
thereafter
laws
and
it
is
our
view
that
there
is
no
present
case
for
controversy
because
the
decree
gives
irvis
no
personal
redress,
but
to
the
contrary
is
a
judgment
punitive
in
character
and
legislative
in
it’s
application.
now
they
stipulated
that
the
loss
of
a
liquor
license
would
seriously
impair
moose
lodge's
ability
to
contribute
to
the
benevolent
purposes
of
the
supreme
lodge.
irvis
didn’t
ask
for
damages,
he
did
not
sue
as
a
tax
payer,
he
didn’t
bring
a
class
action,
he
doesn’t
seek
membership.
he
repeatedly
conceded
here
and
below
the
right
of
the
moose
lodge
to
exclude
him,
and
he
repeatedly
said
that
there
was
nothing
illegal
in
its
doing
so
and
he
rejected
modification
of
the
judgment
which
would
have
let
him
in
as
a
guest.
so
that
all
he
wants
is
to
have
the
moose
lodge
lose
its
liquor
license
and
we
say
he
has
no
personal
stake
in
that
anymore
than
any
of
the
12,000,000
other
inhabitants
of
the
county.
so
that
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes,
your
honor,
and
having
done
our
duty
by
raising
the
jurisdictional
question,
i
ask
for
the
substantive
issue.
by
way
of
essential
preliminary,
i
must
deal
with
the
district
court's
suggestion
that
there
is
somehow
a
difference
between
racial
restrictions
on
the
one
hand
and
religious
or
ethnic
restrictions
on
the
other.
now
that,
to
put
it
most
gently
is
completely
mistaken.
there
is
no
constitutional
distinction
whatever
between
state
action
that
discriminates
either
on
races
--
racial
or
religious
or
ethnic
grounds.
it
is
simply
not
true
that
the
constitution
sustains
the
anti
semi
while
denouncing
the
anti
hemi
(ph).
it
is
simply
not
true
that
some
groups
are
entitled
to
more
equal
protection
than
others.
what
this
purported
distinction
really
does
is
picking
and
choosing
among
association
and
groups
on
the
bases
of
their
beliefs
and
preference
which
seems
to
me
a
most
glaring
denial
of
due
process
because
all
three
restrictions
are
equally
bad
if
the
membership
requirements
are
indeed
state
action
and
interestingly
enough
that
is
the
one
of
the
few
points
on
which
the
attorney
general
of
the
commonwealth
agrees
with
us.
he
says
they
are
all
equally
bad.
therefore,
if
the
private
club
with
the
racial
restriction
can't
have
a
liquor
license
because
those
restrictions
are
state
action,
then
either
can
any
other
private
club
with
religious
or
ethnic
distinctions.
so
that
if
the
judgment
below
is
correct,
scores
of
millions
of
americans
now
associated
in
all
manner
of
private
clubs
can't
have
liquor
licenses
either
and
since
precedents
invariably
build
on
each
other,
the
next
will
be
they
will
risk
losing
building
permits,
restaurant
permits
and
all
the
rest.
irvis
says
they
are
all
different,
but
there
is
a
main
statue
that
makes
the
racially
restricted
club
lose
its
restaurant
permit
also,
while
not
taking
it
away
from
the
religiously
or
ethnically
restrictive
club.
fortunately
for
the
continued
pluralistic
existence
of
the
republic
and
the
elks'
brief
amicus
documents
this
statement
that
we
are
indeed
a
nation
of
jointness.
the
decision
below
is
wrong
for
three
separate
reasons
which
i
shall
discuss
in
order.
first,
the
first
amendment
right
of
associational
privacy
protects
private
clubs
and
fraternal
organizations
from
any
and
all
state
efforts,
directed
at
the
full
exercise
and
joined
under
that
right.
second,
the
issuance
of
a
liquor
license
does
not
and
cannot
transform
the
acts
of
the
licensee
into
those
of
the
licensing
authority
and
three,
congress
in
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
has
twice
drawn
a
line
between
these
apparently
competing
constitutional
rights
by
accepting
from
the
public
accommodations
title,
private
clubs
not
in
fact
open
to
the
public
and
by
forbidding
the
civil
rights
commission
from
investigating
the
membership
practices
and
the
internal
operations,
both
of
private
clubs
and
a
fraternal
organization
and
i
will
take
first
the
right
of
associational
privacy
which
it
seems
to
us
can
be
viewed
in
either
negatively
or
affirmatively.
negatively
it
is
the
proposition
that
social
rights
are
not
enforceable
in
the
courts
or
by
law
and
for
this
proposition
i
draw
on
the
dissenting
opinion
of
the
elder
justice
harlan
in
the
civil
rights
cases.
i
better
give
that
citation
because
it
is
not
in
brief,
109
us
at
59.
i
agree
that
government
has
nothing
to
do
with
social
as
distinguished
from
technically
legal
rights
of
individuals.
no
government
has
ever
brought
or
ever
can
bring
its
people
into
social
intercourse
against
their
wishes.
whether
one
person
will
permit
or
maintain
social
relations
with
another
is
a
matter
with
which
government
has
no
concern
i
agree
that
if
one
citizen
chooses
not
to
hold
social
intercourse
with
another,
he
is
not
and
cannot
be
made
amenable
to
the
law
for
his
conduct
in
that
regard.
for
even
upon
grounds
of
race,
no
legal
right
of
the
citizen
is
violated
by
the
refusal
of
others
to
maintain
nearly
social
relations
with
it.
now
that
as
i
had
indicated
is
a
dissenting
opinion,
but
it
is
in
an
area
where
the
dissents
of
the
elder
justice
harlan
have
now
moral
weight
than
those
of
the
court.
affirmatively
there
is
a
right
of
constitutional
right
of
liberty
of
association
which
is
documented
by
many
decisions
of
this
court
and
which
amounts
to
this
that
in
my
home
and
in
my
club
and
in
my
chose
of
business
associates,
i
can
act
on
my
prejudice
as
even
those
of
race,
i
--
they
can
--
my
preferences
maybe
enlightened,
they
maybe
eccentric,
they
may
be
bigoted,
they
may
represent
prejudices,
they
may
represent
postjudices,
but
in
my
private
domain,
i
can
exclude
whom
i
want
and
for
any
reasons
and
as
indicated
there
is
no
doubt
here.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
think
very
clearly
so
on
the
analogy
that
we
used
in
the
brief
where
the
it
was
the
doctrine
of
unconstitutional
conditions.
your
honor
will
recall
anti
removal
statutes.
well
the
basis,
the
rationality
for
striking
down
those
statures
was
that
the
state
cannot
interfere
with
the
exercise
of
a
federally
guaranteed
right,
so
that
the
answer
is,
the
short
answer
your
honor
is
yes.
the
state
can
interfere
the
right
to
pick
ones
associates
from
among
those
like
minded
is
an
area
beyond
governmental
cognizance
and
the
result
below
really
strikes
a
wounding
blow
at
human
types.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
if
that
private
i
would,
definitely,
definitely
because
if
it
is
private
you
can
discriminate.
if
it
is
a
public
place,
no,
fairly
not,
but
this
is
private,
this
is
--
the
club
is
just
an
extension
of
the
home
and
evidently
knew
--
the
court
said
that
if
you
have
a
golf
club
that
is
all
white
or
a
golf
club
that
is
all
black,
that
is
the
right
of
private
association,
but
if
you
have
a
municipal
golf
course
then
you
cannot
discriminate.
so
i
would
say
as
long
as
long
as
it
is
private,
you
can’t
--
the
state
can't
--
can
no
more
lift
the
license
of
moose
because
it
is
limited
to
caucasians
only
or
to
those
who
aren’t
agnostics
or
aliens,
and
it
can
lift
the
license
of
the
knights
of
columbus
council
which
is
restricted
as
i
am
told
to
practice
in
catholic
or
the
liquor
license
of
the
knights
of
peter
claver,
who
are
black
male
and
catholics,
so
if
it
is
a
boa
fide,
a
private
club
and
of
course
i
am
excluding
the
shams
and
subterfuges
and
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
it
would.
there
isn’t
much
deference
because
your
honor,
once
you
say
that
the
liquor
license
is
special,
we
get
to
the
restaurant
license.
now
my
brother
says
that
the
restaurant
license
is
different.
the
state
of
maine
says
no.
irvis
in
his
last
brief
espouses
the
proposition
from
a
recent
three-judge
court
case
that
anybody
who
discriminates
can't
have
solace
from
the
government.
well,
that
means
that
where
you
cut
of
the
water
because
how
many
--
how
many
homes
in
this
country
get
water
from
other
than
public
body
and
you
would
cut
of
power
in
large
parts
of
the
west,
urban
and
rural
because
of
the
vast
proliferation
of
municipal
power
plants.
so
that
if
you
can
cut
of
a
liquor
license,
you
can
step
by
step
cut
of
all
the
rest,
if
you
agree
with
three-judge
district
court
that
no
discrimination
can
receive
any
solace
and
i
want
to
emphasis,
there
is
no
difference
between
racial,
religious
or
ethnic
because
after
all
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
i
have
three
positions
and
the
second
one
is
which
i'll
--
one
is
the
affirmative
right
to
privacy
and
the
inability
of
law
or
government
to
dictate
social
relations.
the
second
is,
the
second
proposition
for
reversal
is
that
the
issuance
of
a
license
doesn’t
transform
or
transmute
or
metamorphoses
the
acts
of
the
licensee
into
those
of
the
licensesor.
i
want
to
emphasis
the
shaky
and
indeed
sandy
foundation
on
which
the
notion
of
state
action
was
directed
in
this
case.
a
caucasian
member
in
good
standing
brought
plaintiff,
a
negro
to
the
lodge's
dinning
room
and
bar
as
his
guest,
requested
service
of
food
and
beverages.
the
lodge
through
its
employees
refused
service
to
plaintiff,
solely
because
he
was
a
negro.
well,
this
is
an
action
against
the
liquor
control
board
to
remove,
lift
the
liquor
license.
what
did
the
liquor
control
board
had
to
do
with
refusal
to
serve
food
and
there
is
nothing
in
this
finding
by
the
court
that
says
that
the
commonwealth
had
anything
to
do
with
this
refusal
of
service
because
after
all
you
can't
hardly
exist
now
a
days
without
some
kind
of
whole
series
of
licenses
from
state
and
federal
authority.
now
if
i
may
interject
a
personal
note,
i
need
four
licenses
to
be
here
at
this
elect
and
speaking
to
your
honors.
first
i
had
to
be
admitted
to
a
state
court,
then
i
have
to
be
admitted
here,
then
i
have
to
be
admitted
in
the
district
and
now
every
year
i
have
to
pay
professional
license
fee
to
the
district
to
be
able
to
practice
my
profession
and
gain
my
livelihood.
if
you
drive
an
auto
on
the
highway,
you
need
a
driving
license,
you
need
a
car
registration
and
in
many
perhaps
most
states,
you
need
an
annual
safety
inspection.
if
you
operate
a
teetotaler
club
or
a
locker
system
club,
you
need
an
occupancy
permit,
an
elevator
permit
and
a
restaurant
permit.
now
those
essential
licenses
don’t
turn
the
lawyer
or
driver
into
a
public
utility
who
is
required
to
serve
all
commerce
and
those
licenses
don’t
turn
a
private
club
into
a
place
of
public
accommodation.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
am
told
that
having
a
bottle,
well
--
i
am
told
that
having
a
locker
system,
that
is
every
member
having
his
stick
or
stock
of
liquor
in
your
locker,
not
selling
liquor,
not
buying
liquor
from
the
club
that
that
would
not
require
a
liquor
license.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes
but
the
state
doesn’t
say
that
if
you
buy
a
bottle
of
old
overholt
and
take
it
to
your
home,
you
can
exclude
people
you
don’t
like
or
prefer
not
to
associate.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
that
is
the
extent
to
which
you
would
go
and
the
--
the
irrationality
of
the
decision
becomes
apparent
when
you
look
at
some
of
the
other
restrictions.
now
there
as
regulation
119
deals
with
sacramental
lines
--
wines.
by
parity
of
reasoning
that
would
be
unconstitutional
support
of
religion
and
we
think
that
there
just
isn't
any
state
action
here
because
of
any
--
as
i
have
said
it's
benefit,
if
any
benefit
is
a
touch
tone,
nobody
can
have
electric
light
or
electric
power
if
you
discriminate
in
you
home.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
exactly.
in
other
words,
the
position
we
take
on
that
is
the
position
that
your
honor
and
justice
black
and
justice
harlan
took
in
bell
against
maryland,
that
you
can’t
attribute
to
the
licensing
authority
a
discriminatory
acts
on
the
part
of
licensees
is
too
big
of
a
jump.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
your
honor,
i
am
not
an
expert
of
liquor
regulation
in
the
several
states,
but
if
you
--
if
you
say
that
pennsylvania
is
so
pervasive,
you
got
to
have
to
test
the
other
50
states
to
see
whether
there
are
differences.
now
the
notion
that
the
-
the
court
below
espoused
that
it
was
liquor
regulation
was
more
continues
that
other
regulations,
the
bar
isn’t
regulated
anymore
continuously
than
the
restaurant
and
as
for
the
so
called
pervasive
regulation
what
is
pervasive.
look
at
building
codes,
look
at
building
codes.
this
is
the
pennsylvania
liquor
code,
this
is
the
building
official's
conference
of
america
basic
voca,
basic
building
code.
my
figures
are
that
some
800
municipalities
have
adopted
these
codes
in
full
or
in
part.
now,
i
don’t
think
that
one
is
more
pervasive
than
the
other
and
i
think
you
going
to
have
an
awful
time
if
you
are
going
to
try
to
compare
every
area
of
regulation
against
liquor
regulation
to
see
whether
one
is
or
is
not
pervasive.
i
just
think
that
to
say
that
the
pervasiveness
of
a
regulation
transforms
the
acts
of
the
licensee
into
those
of
the
licensing
authority
is
just
to
rewrite
the
constitution.
now,
the
constitution
says
no
state,
no
state
shall
deny
to
any
person
within
its
jurisdiction
the
equal
protection
of
laws.
it
doesn’t
say
no
person
licensed
by
a
state,
it
doesn’t
say
no
person
pervasively
licensed
by
a
state
and
indeed
your
honors
our
entire
recent
constitutional
history
warns
against
two
great
departures
from
the
text.
take
liberty
of
contract.
what
a
sorry
chapter
that
was
from
lochner
v.
new
york
through
morehead
against
tipaldo
or
take
the
immunity
of
governmental
instrumentality
which
--
which
emphasis
the
value
of
looking
to
the
text
rather
than
its
exajesus.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
when
that
doctrine
was
overruled
said
this.
the
judicial
history
of
this
doctrine
of
immunity
is
a
striking
illustration
of
an
occasional
tendency
to
encrust
on
wide
interpretations
upon
the
constitution
and
thereafter
to
consider
merely
what
has
been
judicially
said
about
the
constitution
rather
than
to
be
primarily
controlled
by
a
fair
conception
of
the
constitution.
judicial
exajesus
is
unavoidable
with
reference
to
an
organic
act
like
our
constitution,
drawn
in
many
particulars
with
purpose
of
vagueness
so
as
to
live
room
for
the
unfolding
future.
but
the
ultimate
touch
stone
of
constitutionality
is
the
constitution
itself
and
not
what
we
have
set
about
and
the
constitution
says
no
state.
now
the
third
ground
for
reversal
is
the
congressional
action
in
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
there
are
two
previsions.
first,
is
section
203e
which
exempts
from
the
operation
of
the
public
accommodations
title,
private
clubs
that
are
not
in
fact
open
to
the
public
and
then
perhaps
even
more
significantly
the
section
504a
which
forbids
the
civil
rights
commission
from
examining
the
membership
practices
and
the
internal
operation
of
private
clubs
and
fraternal
organizations
and
that
is
the
commission
as
your
honors
please
that
congress
directed
to
collect
information
concerning
the
denial
of
equal
protection
and
the
weren’t
to
look
into
private
clubs.
congress,
as
the
legislative
history
shows
wanted
to
protect
the
constitutional
right
of
private
association
from
interference
by
the
commission
and
that
is
clear
from
the
legislative
history.
finally,
there
is
a
thirteenth
amendment
point
which
has
been
raised
up
to
page
39,
of
his
brief
here,
irvis
said
the
injury
suffered
by
irvis
was
not
just
that
a
private
organization
barred
him
because
he
was
black.
this,
it
was
entitled
to
do,
but
70
pages
later
he
contents
that
to
have
bargained
was
a
badge
or
incident
of
slavery.
well,
now
that
is
just
doesn’t
wash
because
the
moose
restriction
is
caucasians
only.
that
bars
american
indians.
american
indians
not
only
weren't
never
systematically
enslaved,
but
they
had
negro
slaves
of
their
own.
the
freed
men
of
choctaw
and
chickasaw
and
seminole
nations,
so
that
clearly
caucasians
only
is
not
badge
or
incident
of
slavery.
so
that
we
say
a
jurisdiction
isn’t
lost
or
if
it
can't
be
regained
by
a
memo,
the
judgment
below
must
be
reversed
with
directions
to
dismiss
for
failure
to
safeguard
(inaudible).
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
mr.
chief
justice,
yes,
your
honor.
i
want
to
address
my
self
to
worthy
norms.
the
recognition
of
the
right
of
privacy
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
worthiness
or
unworthiness
of
the
associational
rights
sought
to
be
protected.
us
against
roble,
389
us
held
that
roble's
constitutional
right
of
association
in
this
instance
to
be
a
member
of
the
communist
party
prevail
over
the
congressional
probation
of
his
being
employed
in
the
defense
panel.
i
take
that
decision
did
not
mean
that
the
court
was
endorsing
the
norms
of
the
communist
party,
much
less
saying
that
they
were
worthy
norms
and
the
same
thing
here.
whatever
the
moose
restrictions
are
worthy
or
otherwise
is
not
my
concern.
it
is
their’s.
they
have
the
right
to
privacy
and
i
want
to
emphasis
that
when
they
say
caucasians
only,
it
isn't
any
worst
than
saying
any
one
of
20
european
nationalities
because
there
are
aren’t
black
swiss,
there
are
aren’t
black
swedes,
there
are
aren’t
black
english
and
except
in
the
pejorative
sense
there
are
aren’t
black
irish.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
it
is
not
restrictive
to
someone
who
hails
from
the
region
of
the
caucasus
mountains
and
it's
seems
to
me
that
insofar
as
there
seem
to
be
conflicting
interests
involved,
congress
has
drawn
the
line
in
two
provisions
of
the
civil
rights
act
and
it
is
our
view
if
you
are
going
to
respect.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes,
your
honor.
203e
on
private
clubs,
504a
on
limiting
the
civil
rights
commission
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
are
going
to
support
the
congressional
determination
and
the
enforcement
of
the
both
civil
war
amendments
to
permit
to
illiterates
to
vote
because
that
is
a
congressional
determination,
i
think
you
should
give
at
least
equal
weight
to
the
congressional
determination
that
private
clubs
and
fraternal
organizations
are
beyond
the
reach
of
government.
