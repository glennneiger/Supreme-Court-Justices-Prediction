mr.
harry
j.
rubin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
like
mr.
wiener,
i
would
like
to
begin
with
a
brief
discussion
of
the
preliminary
jurisdictional
issue
which
the
court
has
asked
us
to
argue
and
i
would
like
to
note
as
mr.
wiener
did
that
both
parties
agree
that
a
three-judge
court
jurisdiction
was
proper
in
this
case
and
therefore
approach
the
issue
from
another
angle.
i
would
like
to
approach
it
from
the
standpoint
of
what
this
case
is
not
with
respect
to
the
three-judge
court
problem
and
i
would
take
my
text
from
the
citations
which
appeared
just
a
little
over
a
month
ago
in
this
court's
opinion
in
board
of
regions.
the
citations,
twice
as
i
recall,
to
the
case
of
phillips
versus
the
united
states,
i
believed
in
this
court,
united
states
versus
phillips
in
which
justice
frankfurter
discussed
the
three-judge
court
problem
in
some
depth
and
pointed
out
that
the
touch
stone
in
these
cases
where
we
have
legislative
action
or
administrative
action
is
whether
or
not
there
has
been
some
lawless
exercise
of
authority
by
some
administrative
agency
of
the
commonwealth,
pennsylvania
in
this
case
or
some
state
official
in
the
phillips
case.
and
i
think
when
you
raise
or
cast
this
case
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
there
has
or
has
not
been
a
lawless
exercise
of
authority,
you
realize
that
this
is
not
the
phillips
case.
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
state
liquor
board
acting
pursuant
to
powers
granted
to
it
only
by
the
state
liquor
code
and
acting
strictly
in
accordance
with
the
previsions
of
that
state
liquor
code
has
granted
and
renewed
a
license
to
a
private
club
in
conformity
with
the
provisions
of
that
state
liquor
code.
consequently
this
case
does
not
involve
the
type
of
lawless,
unauthorized
administrative
action
which
the
court
in
the
phillips
case
held
would
preclude
three-judge
court
jurisdiction.
i
think
it
goes
without
saying
of
course
that
this
is
not
a
case
like
board
of
regents.
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
only
a
purely
local
issue
is
involved.
this
is
a
case
in
which
a
state
wide
statue,
depicting
state
wide
policy
of
state
wide
application
is
presented
to
the
court.
i
think
we
need
not
dwell
on
that
particular
aspect
of
the
three-judge
court
problem.
i
would
point
out
that
this
case
goes
further
than
a
case
in
the
area
of
liquor
regulation
in
which
this
court
has
upheld
three-judge
court
jurisdiction.
in
the
case
of
idlewild
v.
epstein,
the
new
york
liquor
case
involving
the
store
at
new
york
airport,
the
court
upheld
three-judge
court
jurisdiction
there
in
an
attack
on
a
special
provision
of
the
new
york
liquor
law
which
applied
only
to
one
particular
complainant
the
idlewild
liquor
shop
at
the
new
york
airport.
that
shop
claiming
that
it
was
not
required
to
get
a
license
because
of
its
peculiar
operations
in
which
it
sold
only
to
passengers
in
foreign
commerce.
well,
our
case
is
much
broader
than
that.
our
case
involves
statewide
application
of
pennsylvania's
liquor
laws
to
hundreds
of
state
wide
and
local
club
organizations.
consequently
if
phillips
is
good
law
if
idlewild
is
good
law,
if
board
of
regents
is
good
law
as
i
urge
that
they
all
are,
then
this
case
does
present
a
case
for
a
three-judge
court
jurisdiction
and
does
present
a
case
for
appeal
to
this
court
from
the
decision
of
the
court
below.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
yes,
mr.
justice
white
the
pennsylvania
human
relations
commission
and
i
speak
only
from
hearsay,
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
case
nor
did
my
client
have
anything
to
do
with
that
case,
the
pennsylvania
human
relations
commission
itself
brought
an
action
in
the
state
courts,
seeking
to
hold
that
his
private
club
was
in
fact
a
place
of
public
accommodation,
i
believe
on
the
grounds
that
because
it
allowed
guests
to
enter,
it
should
then
be
so
held
to
that
extent.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
under
the
pennsylvania
law.
that
case,
that
argument
was
rejected
by
the
court
of
common
police
in
dauphin
county
in
harrisburg.
on
appeal
to
the
pennsylvania
superior
court,
it
was
again
rejected
and
the
decision
of
the
court
below
was
affirmed.
it
was
held
that
this
was
not
a
place
of
public
accommodation.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
i
understand
that
the
human
relations
commission
has
filed
a
petition
to
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
requesting
the
supreme
court
to
hear
it
and
at
best
i
know
no
action
has
been
taken
on
that
petition.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
that
issue
would
be
considered
still
pending.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
there
was
not.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
as
the
human
relations
commission
has
brought
it
under
pennsylvania
human
relations
act.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
we
have
taken
that
position
from
beginning
of
the
case.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
i
think
an
all
black
club
whose
only
purpose
was
to
provide
social
and
fraternal
amenities
to
it's
membership
would
be
in
the
same
position.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
mr.
wiener
has
raised
the
question
based
on
the
lower
court
statement
about
ethnic
clubs,
religious
clubs
and
we
have
answered
it
this
way
at
great
length
in
our
brief
and
i'll
argue
this.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
the
answer
is
yes
and
no
mr.
justice
white
and
the
answer
is
this
way.
there
are
bona
fide
private
clubs
whose
purposes
involve
ethnic
distinctions,
that
is
in
the
brief
that
has
been
filed
by
elks,
there
are
literally
hundreds
of
clubs
of
say
ethnic
americans
who
are
together
in
private
organizations
for
the
purpose
of
furthering
their
ethnic
histories,
their
ethnic
traditions,
their
ethnic
backgrounds.
if
that
club
is
bona
fide
and
once
we
have
passed
the
special
scrutiny
that
race
requires
in
these
matters
then
there
is
no
reason
why
that
club
cannot
discriminate
on
those
grounds
as
we
see
it
because
the
purpose
of
the
discrimination
is
a
rationale
one.
it
is
not
what
this
court
is
called
invidious
discrimination.
it
is
true
they
may
exclude
someone
who
is
not
of
that
ethnic
origin,
but
the
purpose
of
the
club
being
in
existence
is
a
reasonable
one,
it
is
not
just
a
social
purpose.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
all
male
clubs?
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
we
still
don’t
have
a
constitutional
amendment
as
i
believe,
forbidding
discrimination
on
grounds
of
sex.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
well,
that
is
as
far
as
i
know
there
has
been
no
ruling
on
that
point.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
on
all
male
clubs?
i
would
have
to
relay
on
the
feeling
that
since
we
do
not
yet
have
a
constitutional
amendment
specifically
stating
that
the
equal
protection
clause
does
not
provide
that
type
of
protection.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
a
restaurant
is
a
normally
a
public
place,
a
person
who
is
entitled
to
go.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
a
restaurant
sure
has
waived
any
rights
to
privacy.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
yes
in
that
respect.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
i
would
probably
have
to
ask
further
why
you
were
stopped
at
the
door?
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
like
mr.
wiener
in
his
discussion
of
liquor
laws,
i
am
going
to
have
to
retreat
to
the
point
of
saying
i
know
little
or
not
about
that
to
try
to
expound
on
the
depths
to
which
that
would
go.
we
know
how
far
we
would
go
when
we
are
discussing
this
particular
problem.
i
am
not
sufficiently
familiar
with
the
black
muslims.
i
do
want
to
mention
one
other
thing,
however,
in
connection
with
the
preliminary
issues
or
what
would
i
call
the
preliminary
issues
and
that
is
this
question
whether
there
is
or
is
not
a
case
or
controversy
here.
mr.
irvis
initiated
this
case,
seeking
only
one
thing.
he
was
only
seeking
to
preclude
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
from
giving
solace
or
support
or
comfort
to
the
discriminating
private
club
by
issuing
this
liquor
license
to
it.
he
never
at
any
time
requested
membership
in
the
moose
lodge
because
we
respect
the
right
of
moose
lodge
as
a
private
club
to
determine
it's
own
membership
requirements.
he
did
not
seek
damages
because
the
nature
of
the
deprivation
that
is
involved
here
would
make
a
redress
by
way
of
damages
insufficient
and
inadequate,
this
is
a
continuing
type
of
discrimination
that
takes
place
which
would
involve
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
over
and
over
and
over
again.
therefore,
it
seems
to
us
and
we
assume
that
the
lower
court
agrees
that
the
proper
redress
here
is
to
sever
the
relationship
between
the
discriminating
private
club
and
the
commonwealth.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
yes
i
think
the
same
--
that
result
inevitably
follows
your
honor.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
the
problem
--
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
that
is
correct.
the
problem
then
will
only
be
one
of
proof
that
is
it
does
the
moose
lodge
in
fact
exclude
negroes,
there
obviously
would
been
no
proof
problem.
here
our
proof
was
supplied
by
the
fact
that
mr.
irvis
was
excluded,
so
we
don’t
have
that
problem.
(inaudible)
in
the
--
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
it
tuned
--
it
was
the
catalyst
which
proved
our
point.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
you
mean
i
think
the
white
person
who
was
the
member
of
the
moose
lodge?
any
citizen
could
raise
it
i
suppose?
i
am
not
that
certain,
i
think
that
a
black
person,
any
person
who
is
discriminated
against,
has
a
special
standing.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
yes,
i
think
that
is
true.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
mr.
irvis
was
taken
to
the
club
by
a
white
member
and
they
sat
down
at
the
bar.
i
understand
they
requested
food
and
beverage
and
were
refused.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
i
believe
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
yes
on
page
32
of
the
appendix,
mr.
wiener
points
out
in
the
opinion
of
the
court,
food
and
beverage
were
requested.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
food
and
beverage
--
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
that
is
correct.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
it
will
put
mr.
irvis
in
a
position
of
being
a
negro
citizen
of
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
who
knows
that
a
private
club
is
not
being
aided
by
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
in
its
discrimination.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
the
restaurant
license?
the
restaurant
license
like
and
i
would
answer
mr.
justice
white's
point
on
the
same
thing.
we
think
of
the
restaurant
license,
the
building
permit,
the
supply
of
water,
the
supply
of
electricity
as
being
in
a
totally
different
category
from
this
liquor
license
and
there
are
several
reasons
for
that.
first
of
all
the
restaurant
license,
the
building
permit
are
supplied
to
the
moose
lodge
as
they
are
supplied
to
any
public,
any
person,
any
organization
for
the
benefit
of
the
public.
it
is
for
public
health
and
safety.
they
are
open
to
all
persons.
water
and
electricity
is
supplied
to
all
persons
generally.
it's
a
function
of
government.
the
liquor
license
is
not
in
that
position.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
the
restaurant
license
mr.
justice
marshal
as
we
understand
it
it
is
only
a
sanitary
license,
that
is
we
only
used
the
phrase
restaurant
license,
we
where
talking
only
about
that
license
which
indicates
that
the
city
of
harrisburg
has
inspected
the
restaurant
kitchen
facilities
and
found
them
to
be
sanitary.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
and
must
continue
to
do
it,
but
that
to
is
for
the
protection
of
the
public,
protection
of
those
persons
who
use
the
restaurant,
it
is
not
the
type
of
license
that
has
special
benefit
to
it.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
the
motion
that
was
made
to
modify
was
a
motion
which
would
have
allowed
mr.
irvis
to
be
admitted
as
a
guest.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
i
would
assume
it
would
have
to
be
any
others,
mr.
wieners
has
so
stated.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
yes
i
can
answer
both
of
those
questions
i
think
at
the
same
time.
the
motion
to
modify
which
would
have
allowed
mr.
irvis
or
any
others
to
be
admitted
us
a
guest
would
have
done
nothing
to
remove
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
from
the
discriminatory
actions
of
the
moose
lodge,
that
is
it
still
would
have
been
a
matter
of
being
dependent
upon
a
white
member
of
the
moose
lodge
to
invite
him
there.
it
still
would
have
been
a
matter
of
no
particular
negro
being
sure
that
the
moose
lodge
would
or
would
not
discriminate.
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
would
still
be
issuing
that
license
to
a
discriminating
private
club
and
i
think
it
worth
nothing
that
at
the
time
this
motion
to
modify
was
being
presented,
the
moose
lodge
was
in
the
process
of
amending
it's
by
laws
to
forbid
negroes
from
being
guest.
so
at
the
same
time
they
were
saying
let
us
modify
the
decree
so
that
we
can
admit
mr.
irvis
as
a
guest,
their
by
laws
were
being
amended
to
say
no
negroes
can
came
in
as
guest
let
alone
members.
we
feel
that
the
idea
that
he
should
then
be
allowed
to
come
in
as
a
guest
to
a
modification
decree
does
not
go
to
heart
of
the
problem.
it
does
not
supply
the
type
of
redress
that
we
think
cuts
through
the
problem
of
state
participation
or
support
for
the
discrimination
of
the
moose
lodge
and
that
is
why
we
opposed
it.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
that
is
correct.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
that
is
correct.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
that
is
right.
we
have
never
requested
membership.
we
would
not
request
membership
because
we
respect
the
argument
that
the
moose
lodge
as
a
private
club
is
entitled
to
select
it's
own
members.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
we
are
only
asking
that
pennsylvania’s
liquor
licensing
participation
be
removed
from
whatever
moose
lodge
wants
to
do.
there
have
been
references
made
to
the
bottle
club
problem.
like
mr.
wiener
i
would
say
in
pennsylvania
that
does
not
pose
any
issue
of
state
involvement
at
all.
a
person
can
take
a
bottle
to
another
place,
sit
down
with
his
friends
and
have
a
drink
of
liquor
if
he
wishes.
but
that
is
not
the
same
thing
as
we
have
here
and
i
--
just
so
that
there
is
no
misunderstanding
of
what
we
have
here,
i
trust
the
court
understands
that
in
pennsylvania
liquor
licenses
are
not
just
something
freely
available.
there
is
a
quota
system
to
the
number
of
licenses
that
can
be
given.
there
is
local
option
which
prevent
licenses
from
being
given
out
to
certain
places.
it
has
been
stipulated
in
this
case
that
the
liquor
license
provides
special
benefits
to
the
moose
lodge
because
the
moose
lodge
has
stipulated
that
it
would
suffer
damage
in
it's
membership
and
operations
if
it
didn’t
have
this
liquor
license
and
that
is
why
to
go
back
to
what
i
was
saying
before
and
to
what
mr.
justice
white
raised
before.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
no
it
does
not
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
off
hand?
no
i
would
have
to
say
that
it
is
in
hundreds.
in
the
brief
for
the
commonwealth
attorney
general,
this
is
not
in
the
record,
it
is
in
the
attorney
general's
brief,
there
are
4238
clubs
licensed
under
the
pennsylvania
liquor
code.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
that
is
my
understanding
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
he
was
simply
refused
service
and
he
was
told
he
was
refused
service
because
he
was
a
negro.
there
was
nothing
written
in
the
bylaws
that
said
guests
could
not
be
negroes.
that
came
during
the
course
of
these
proceedings.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
i
would
have
to
answer
that
mr.
chief
justice
by
saying
that
i
am
not
really
aware
of
it
and
i
am
not
sure
whether
we
were
talking
locker
clubs
as
one
thing.
i
think
the
reference
in
mr.
wiener's
brief
was
to
a
bottle
club.
i
was
thinking
when
i
read
that
of
someone
who
would
live
this
house
with
a
bottle
in
his
hand,
go
to
his
club,
meet
with
some
few
of
his
friends
and
have
a
drink.
to
that
extent
i
don’t
know
of
any
regulation,
but
i
would
not
preclude
that
from
being
the
case
in
other
states.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
yes
it
clearly
states
that
on
page
32.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
i
would
have
to
look.
i
know
that
the
court's
opinion
below
is
very
clearly
stated
that
point.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
oh
yes
there
was
no
question
about
that
mr.
chief
justice.
that
was
a
matter
of
public
record
i
should
say
because
it
was
in
the
newspapers
at
that
time.
there
was
--
no
one
had
any
question
about
that
point.
i
do
want
to
finish
the
point
i
was
making
about
whether
or
not
this
license
is
like
water
or
like
electricity.
i
would
sum
that
up
simply
by
saying
that
when
you
have
the
government
providing
or
through
the
governmental
process
some
thing
that
is
being
provided
to
everyone,
you
don’t
have
the
same
thing
as
you
have
with
the
liquor
license
in
pennsylvania.
as
i
mentioned
pennsylvania
has
a
restriction
on
liquor
licenses.
they
aren’t
freely
available.
in
addition
to
that,
the
liquor
license
can
further
certain
special
benefits
as
this
record
very
clearly
shows
by
the
moose
lodge's
own
admissions.
it
would
have
trouble
maintaining
it's
self
according
to
it
and
it's
membership
and
it's
operations,
if
it
didn't
have
this
liquor
license.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
that
is
true,
but
the
heat
or
light
is
supplied
to
you,
to
me
and
to
everyone
else
--
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
that
is
correct,
but
we
think
the
proper
constitutional
line
is
if
the
government
is
doing
something
on
a
special
places,
if
there
are
some
special
benefit,
not
freely
available
to
all
and
this
is
the
case
with
the
liquor
license.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
no,
there
are
many
places
in
pennsylvania
tpday
where
there
are
no
license
is
available
because
the
--
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
well,
i
can
only
go
outside
the
record
mr.
justice
white
on
that
by
telling
you
that
any
recent
case
of
which
i
am
familiar,
when
a
new
municipality
elected
to
have
a
licenses,
there
would
was
such
a
rush
for
club
licenses
that
everyone
was
trampled,
so
there
seems
to
have
no
end
to
the
desire
for
these
restrictive
licenses
in
pennsylvania
just
like
the
fact
that
there
are
4000
--
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
i
would
disqualify
those
who
discriminate
on
grounds
of
race
and
i
want
to
make
it
perfectly
clear,
i
previously
indicated
in
my
answer
to
your
question
that
there
are
certain
clubs
which
discriminate
in
which
racial
discrimination
may
take
place
as
a
consequence
of
a
nature
of
a
discrimination
and
that
makes
discrimination.
it
may
or
may
not
take
place,
but
if
that
ethnic
discrimination
is
reasonable
in
relation
to
the
purposes
of
the
club,
we
are
satisfied
that
that
is
permissible
and
i
don’t
want
to
overlook
in
al
candor
something
that
is
not
mentioned
in
the
brief
of
moose
lodge
and
that
is
there
are
many
clubs.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
there
are
many
clubs
in
that
list
of
elks
that
the
presents
which
you
know
in
our
opinion
would
not
be
precluded
from
getting
a
liquor
license,
but
there
are
many
clubs
which
are
not
in
that
list,
the
local
social
clubs
which
have
no
purpose
in
life
except
social,
there
is
no
basis
for
their
discrimination
except
they
don’t
want
negroes,
those
clubs
would
be
affected
by
this
decision
in
pennsylvania,
there
is
no
question
about
that.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
there
it
is
there
is
a
case
as
i
recall
barton
case
in
this
court
in
which
it
would
have
--
it
would
have
stated
that
the
white
person
who
was
affected
by
the
discrimination
practiced
against
his
black
brother
would
have
a
cost
of
action
against
his
club,
would
have
standing
to
raise
that.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
well,
he
has
the
right
not
to
raise
it
as
well
as
to
raise
it,
but
we
would
have
indicated
that
mr.
ingleheart
who
happened
to
be
the
white
member
who
took
mr.
irvis
to
the
club
would
have
been
able
to
bring
a
case
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
that
is
not
the
direct
issue
here.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
i
don’t
think
that
mr.
irvis
is
harmed
by
a
sanction
against
the
guest
because
there
was
no
sanction.
if
in
fact
the
moose
lodge
(voice
overlap)
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
that
is
true
and
i
think
that
is
mr.
ingleheart,
that
would
be
his
right
of
action
to
raise
it,
just
like
i
think,
yes
sir
mr.
justice
powell?
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
well,
it
really
is
my
position
that
we
are
slowly
reaching
the
point
where
that
will
not
be
allowed.
i
do
not
know
if
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
yet
reached
that
point,
but
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
the
purpose
of
the
club
has
nothing
to
do
with
maleness
to
be
consistent
with
my
position
with
respect
to
the
reasons
for
the
clubs'
existence,
if
it
has
nothing
to
with
maleness
as
such
and
there
is
no
reasonable
ground
for
the
exclusion,
then
the
club
would
have
to
be
put
to
the
test
of
admitting
the
female
or
giving
up
its
license,
but
it
would
not
be
ordered
out
of
hand
to
admit
the
female;
that
is
the
basis
for
the
distinction,
we
are
making
here
between
a
private
club
and
a
public
organization.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
i
just
going
to
have
to
avoid
that
question
i
suppose
the
reasons
for
it
in
one
culture
is
different
from
the
reasons
in
another.
i
understand
in
the
orient
they
don’t
find
those
distinctions
that
we
do.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
the
license
it
self
is
not
expensive.
no
license
is
expensive
itself
as
pennsylvania
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
the
differences
are
only
in
the
fact
that
basically
the
club
has
more
freedom
in
the
use
of
it's
license.
it
can
stay
open
on
sundays
it
can
stay
open
on
election
day,
stay
open
on
sunday
is
great
time
now
pennsylvania
were
to
open
else
where
but
there
is
no
other
great
distinction
between
the
licenses.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
that's
one
of
the
values
certainly
one
of
the
values.
we
think
that
what
we
are
dealing
here,
if
it
please
the
court
with
is
a
matter
of
great
concern
to
the
country.
it's
a
matter
of
whether
of
not
state
supported,
state
aided
discriminations
should
be
permitted.
a
member
of
this
court
i
think
has
stated
it
as
well
as
anyone.
the
state
action
doctrine
reflects
the
profound
judgment
that
denials
of
equal
treatment
and
particularly
denials
on
account
of
race
or
color
are
singularly
grey
when
government
has
or
shares
responsibility
for
them.
government
is
the
social
organ
to
which
all
in
our
society
look
for
the
promotion
of
liberty,
justice,
fair
and
equal
treatment
in
the
setting
of
worthy
norms
and
goals
for
social
conduct.
therefore
something
is
uniquely
amiss
in
a
society
where
the
government,
the
authoritative
article
of
community
values
involves
itself
in
racial
discrimination.
we
see
this
case
as
a
case
which
pennsylvania
by
granting
this
license
to
this
private
club
and
to
other
racially
discriminating
private
clubs
has
involved
itself
in
the
racial
discrimination
of
the
private
club
and
we
urge
this
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
the
state
would
share
mr.
chief
justice
in
the
same
way
that
the
state
would
have
shared
in
barton.
it
helped
to
make
possible
the
existence
and
the
actions
of
the
organization
which
does
the
discriminating.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
that
is
perfectly
alright.
the
state
with
in
not
share
in
the
discrimination
and
that
is
all
we
are
seeking.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
that
is
correct.
we
see
no,
no,
nothing
wrong
in
the
discrimination.
it
is
in
the
state
participation.
thank
you.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
like
mr.
wiener,
i
would
like
to
begin
with
a
brief
discussion
of
the
preliminary
jurisdictional
issue
which
the
court
has
asked
us
to
argue
and
i
would
like
to
note
as
mr.
wiener
did
that
both
parties
agree
that
a
three-judge
court
jurisdiction
was
proper
in
this
case
and
therefore
approach
the
issue
from
another
angle.
i
would
like
to
approach
it
from
the
standpoint
of
what
this
case
is
not
with
respect
to
the
three-judge
court
problem
and
i
would
take
my
text
from
the
citations
which
appeared
just
a
little
over
a
month
ago
in
this
court's
opinion
in
board
of
regions.
the
citations,
twice
as
i
recall,
to
the
case
of
phillips
versus
the
united
states,
i
believed
in
this
court,
united
states
versus
phillips
in
which
justice
frankfurter
discussed
the
three-judge
court
problem
in
some
depth
and
pointed
out
that
the
touch
stone
in
these
cases
where
we
have
legislative
action
or
administrative
action
is
whether
or
not
there
has
been
some
lawless
exercise
of
authority
by
some
administrative
agency
of
the
commonwealth,
pennsylvania
in
this
case
or
some
state
official
in
the
phillips
case.
and
i
think
when
you
raise
or
cast
this
case
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
there
has
or
has
not
been
a
lawless
exercise
of
authority,
you
realize
that
this
is
not
the
phillips
case.
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
state
liquor
board
acting
pursuant
to
powers
granted
to
it
only
by
the
state
liquor
code
and
acting
strictly
in
accordance
with
the
previsions
of
that
state
liquor
code
has
granted
and
renewed
a
license
to
a
private
club
in
conformity
with
the
provisions
of
that
state
liquor
code.
consequently
this
case
does
not
involve
the
type
of
lawless,
unauthorized
administrative
action
which
the
court
in
the
phillips
case
held
would
preclude
three-judge
court
jurisdiction.
i
think
it
goes
without
saying
of
course
that
this
is
not
a
case
like
board
of
regents.
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
only
a
purely
local
issue
is
involved.
this
is
a
case
in
which
a
state
wide
statue,
depicting
state
wide
policy
of
state
wide
application
is
presented
to
the
court.
i
think
we
need
not
dwell
on
that
particular
aspect
of
the
three-judge
court
problem.
i
would
point
out
that
this
case
goes
further
than
a
case
in
the
area
of
liquor
regulation
in
which
this
court
has
upheld
three-judge
court
jurisdiction.
in
the
case
of
idlewild
v.
epstein,
the
new
york
liquor
case
involving
the
store
at
new
york
airport,
the
court
upheld
three-judge
court
jurisdiction
there
in
an
attack
on
a
special
provision
of
the
new
york
liquor
law
which
applied
only
to
one
particular
complainant
the
idlewild
liquor
shop
at
the
new
york
airport.
that
shop
claiming
that
it
was
not
required
to
get
a
license
because
of
its
peculiar
operations
in
which
it
sold
only
to
passengers
in
foreign
commerce.
well,
our
case
is
much
broader
than
that.
our
case
involves
statewide
application
of
pennsylvania's
liquor
laws
to
hundreds
of
state
wide
and
local
club
organizations.
consequently
if
phillips
is
good
law
if
idlewild
is
good
law,
if
board
of
regents
is
good
law
as
i
urge
that
they
all
are,
then
this
case
does
present
a
case
for
a
three-judge
court
jurisdiction
and
does
present
a
case
for
appeal
to
this
court
from
the
decision
of
the
court
below.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
yes,
mr.
justice
white
the
pennsylvania
human
relations
commission
and
i
speak
only
from
hearsay,
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
case
nor
did
my
client
have
anything
to
do
with
that
case,
the
pennsylvania
human
relations
commission
itself
brought
an
action
in
the
state
courts,
seeking
to
hold
that
his
private
club
was
in
fact
a
place
of
public
accommodation,
i
believe
on
the
grounds
that
because
it
allowed
guests
to
enter,
it
should
then
be
so
held
to
that
extent.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
under
the
pennsylvania
law.
that
case,
that
argument
was
rejected
by
the
court
of
common
police
in
dauphin
county
in
harrisburg.
on
appeal
to
the
pennsylvania
superior
court,
it
was
again
rejected
and
the
decision
of
the
court
below
was
affirmed.
it
was
held
that
this
was
not
a
place
of
public
accommodation.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
i
understand
that
the
human
relations
commission
has
filed
a
petition
to
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
requesting
the
supreme
court
to
hear
it
and
at
best
i
know
no
action
has
been
taken
on
that
petition.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
that
issue
would
be
considered
still
pending.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
there
was
not.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
as
the
human
relations
commission
has
brought
it
under
pennsylvania
human
relations
act.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
we
have
taken
that
position
from
beginning
of
the
case.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
i
think
an
all
black
club
whose
only
purpose
was
to
provide
social
and
fraternal
amenities
to
it's
membership
would
be
in
the
same
position.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
mr.
wiener
has
raised
the
question
based
on
the
lower
court
statement
about
ethnic
clubs,
religious
clubs
and
we
have
answered
it
this
way
at
great
length
in
our
brief
and
i'll
argue
this.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
the
answer
is
yes
and
no
mr.
justice
white
and
the
answer
is
this
way.
there
are
bona
fide
private
clubs
whose
purposes
involve
ethnic
distinctions,
that
is
in
the
brief
that
has
been
filed
by
elks,
there
are
literally
hundreds
of
clubs
of
say
ethnic
americans
who
are
together
in
private
organizations
for
the
purpose
of
furthering
their
ethnic
histories,
their
ethnic
traditions,
their
ethnic
backgrounds.
if
that
club
is
bona
fide
and
once
we
have
passed
the
special
scrutiny
that
race
requires
in
these
matters
then
there
is
no
reason
why
that
club
cannot
discriminate
on
those
grounds
as
we
see
it
because
the
purpose
of
the
discrimination
is
a
rationale
one.
it
is
not
what
this
court
is
called
invidious
discrimination.
it
is
true
they
may
exclude
someone
who
is
not
of
that
ethnic
origin,
but
the
purpose
of
the
club
being
in
existence
is
a
reasonable
one,
it
is
not
just
a
social
purpose.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
all
male
clubs?
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
we
still
don’t
have
a
constitutional
amendment
as
i
believe,
forbidding
discrimination
on
grounds
of
sex.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
well,
that
is
as
far
as
i
know
there
has
been
no
ruling
on
that
point.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
on
all
male
clubs?
i
would
have
to
relay
on
the
feeling
that
since
we
do
not
yet
have
a
constitutional
amendment
specifically
stating
that
the
equal
protection
clause
does
not
provide
that
type
of
protection.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
a
restaurant
is
a
normally
a
public
place,
a
person
who
is
entitled
to
go.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
a
restaurant
sure
has
waived
any
rights
to
privacy.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
yes
in
that
respect.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
i
would
probably
have
to
ask
further
why
you
were
stopped
at
the
door?
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
like
mr.
wiener
in
his
discussion
of
liquor
laws,
i
am
going
to
have
to
retreat
to
the
point
of
saying
i
know
little
or
not
about
that
to
try
to
expound
on
the
depths
to
which
that
would
go.
we
know
how
far
we
would
go
when
we
are
discussing
this
particular
problem.
i
am
not
sufficiently
familiar
with
the
black
muslims.
i
do
want
to
mention
one
other
thing,
however,
in
connection
with
the
preliminary
issues
or
what
would
i
call
the
preliminary
issues
and
that
is
this
question
whether
there
is
or
is
not
a
case
or
controversy
here.
mr.
irvis
initiated
this
case,
seeking
only
one
thing.
he
was
only
seeking
to
preclude
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
from
giving
solace
or
support
or
comfort
to
the
discriminating
private
club
by
issuing
this
liquor
license
to
it.
he
never
at
any
time
requested
membership
in
the
moose
lodge
because
we
respect
the
right
of
moose
lodge
as
a
private
club
to
determine
it's
own
membership
requirements.
he
did
not
seek
damages
because
the
nature
of
the
deprivation
that
is
involved
here
would
make
a
redress
by
way
of
damages
insufficient
and
inadequate,
this
is
a
continuing
type
of
discrimination
that
takes
place
which
would
involve
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
over
and
over
and
over
again.
therefore,
it
seems
to
us
and
we
assume
that
the
lower
court
agrees
that
the
proper
redress
here
is
to
sever
the
relationship
between
the
discriminating
private
club
and
the
commonwealth.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
yes
i
think
the
same
--
that
result
inevitably
follows
your
honor.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
the
problem
--
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
that
is
correct.
the
problem
then
will
only
be
one
of
proof
that
is
it
does
the
moose
lodge
in
fact
exclude
negroes,
there
obviously
would
been
no
proof
problem.
here
our
proof
was
supplied
by
the
fact
that
mr.
irvis
was
excluded,
so
we
don’t
have
that
problem.
(inaudible)
in
the
--
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
it
tuned
--
it
was
the
catalyst
which
proved
our
point.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
you
mean
i
think
the
white
person
who
was
the
member
of
the
moose
lodge?
any
citizen
could
raise
it
i
suppose?
i
am
not
that
certain,
i
think
that
a
black
person,
any
person
who
is
discriminated
against,
has
a
special
standing.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
yes,
i
think
that
is
true.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
mr.
irvis
was
taken
to
the
club
by
a
white
member
and
they
sat
down
at
the
bar.
i
understand
they
requested
food
and
beverage
and
were
refused.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
i
believe
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
yes
on
page
32
of
the
appendix,
mr.
wiener
points
out
in
the
opinion
of
the
court,
food
and
beverage
were
requested.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
food
and
beverage
--
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
that
is
correct.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
it
will
put
mr.
irvis
in
a
position
of
being
a
negro
citizen
of
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
who
knows
that
a
private
club
is
not
being
aided
by
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
in
its
discrimination.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
the
restaurant
license?
the
restaurant
license
like
and
i
would
answer
mr.
justice
white's
point
on
the
same
thing.
we
think
of
the
restaurant
license,
the
building
permit,
the
supply
of
water,
the
supply
of
electricity
as
being
in
a
totally
different
category
from
this
liquor
license
and
there
are
several
reasons
for
that.
first
of
all
the
restaurant
license,
the
building
permit
are
supplied
to
the
moose
lodge
as
they
are
supplied
to
any
public,
any
person,
any
organization
for
the
benefit
of
the
public.
it
is
for
public
health
and
safety.
they
are
open
to
all
persons.
water
and
electricity
is
supplied
to
all
persons
generally.
it's
a
function
of
government.
the
liquor
license
is
not
in
that
position.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
the
restaurant
license
mr.
justice
marshal
as
we
understand
it
it
is
only
a
sanitary
license,
that
is
we
only
used
the
phrase
restaurant
license,
we
where
talking
only
about
that
license
which
indicates
that
the
city
of
harrisburg
has
inspected
the
restaurant
kitchen
facilities
and
found
them
to
be
sanitary.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
and
must
continue
to
do
it,
but
that
to
is
for
the
protection
of
the
public,
protection
of
those
persons
who
use
the
restaurant,
it
is
not
the
type
of
license
that
has
special
benefit
to
it.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
the
motion
that
was
made
to
modify
was
a
motion
which
would
have
allowed
mr.
irvis
to
be
admitted
as
a
guest.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
i
would
assume
it
would
have
to
be
any
others,
mr.
wieners
has
so
stated.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
yes
i
can
answer
both
of
those
questions
i
think
at
the
same
time.
the
motion
to
modify
which
would
have
allowed
mr.
irvis
or
any
others
to
be
admitted
us
a
guest
would
have
done
nothing
to
remove
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
from
the
discriminatory
actions
of
the
moose
lodge,
that
is
it
still
would
have
been
a
matter
of
being
dependent
upon
a
white
member
of
the
moose
lodge
to
invite
him
there.
it
still
would
have
been
a
matter
of
no
particular
negro
being
sure
that
the
moose
lodge
would
or
would
not
discriminate.
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
would
still
be
issuing
that
license
to
a
discriminating
private
club
and
i
think
it
worth
nothing
that
at
the
time
this
motion
to
modify
was
being
presented,
the
moose
lodge
was
in
the
process
of
amending
it's
by
laws
to
forbid
negroes
from
being
guest.
so
at
the
same
time
they
were
saying
let
us
modify
the
decree
so
that
we
can
admit
mr.
irvis
as
a
guest,
their
by
laws
were
being
amended
to
say
no
negroes
can
came
in
as
guest
let
alone
members.
we
feel
that
the
idea
that
he
should
then
be
allowed
to
come
in
as
a
guest
to
a
modification
decree
does
not
go
to
heart
of
the
problem.
it
does
not
supply
the
type
of
redress
that
we
think
cuts
through
the
problem
of
state
participation
or
support
for
the
discrimination
of
the
moose
lodge
and
that
is
why
we
opposed
it.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
that
is
correct.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
that
is
correct.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
that
is
right.
we
have
never
requested
membership.
we
would
not
request
membership
because
we
respect
the
argument
that
the
moose
lodge
as
a
private
club
is
entitled
to
select
it's
own
members.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
we
are
only
asking
that
pennsylvania’s
liquor
licensing
participation
be
removed
from
whatever
moose
lodge
wants
to
do.
there
have
been
references
made
to
the
bottle
club
problem.
like
mr.
wiener
i
would
say
in
pennsylvania
that
does
not
pose
any
issue
of
state
involvement
at
all.
a
person
can
take
a
bottle
to
another
place,
sit
down
with
his
friends
and
have
a
drink
of
liquor
if
he
wishes.
but
that
is
not
the
same
thing
as
we
have
here
and
i
--
just
so
that
there
is
no
misunderstanding
of
what
we
have
here,
i
trust
the
court
understands
that
in
pennsylvania
liquor
licenses
are
not
just
something
freely
available.
there
is
a
quota
system
to
the
number
of
licenses
that
can
be
given.
there
is
local
option
which
prevent
licenses
from
being
given
out
to
certain
places.
it
has
been
stipulated
in
this
case
that
the
liquor
license
provides
special
benefits
to
the
moose
lodge
because
the
moose
lodge
has
stipulated
that
it
would
suffer
damage
in
it's
membership
and
operations
if
it
didn’t
have
this
liquor
license
and
that
is
why
to
go
back
to
what
i
was
saying
before
and
to
what
mr.
justice
white
raised
before.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
no
it
does
not
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
off
hand?
no
i
would
have
to
say
that
it
is
in
hundreds.
in
the
brief
for
the
commonwealth
attorney
general,
this
is
not
in
the
record,
it
is
in
the
attorney
general's
brief,
there
are
4238
clubs
licensed
under
the
pennsylvania
liquor
code.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
that
is
my
understanding
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
he
was
simply
refused
service
and
he
was
told
he
was
refused
service
because
he
was
a
negro.
there
was
nothing
written
in
the
bylaws
that
said
guests
could
not
be
negroes.
that
came
during
the
course
of
these
proceedings.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
i
would
have
to
answer
that
mr.
chief
justice
by
saying
that
i
am
not
really
aware
of
it
and
i
am
not
sure
whether
we
were
talking
locker
clubs
as
one
thing.
i
think
the
reference
in
mr.
wiener's
brief
was
to
a
bottle
club.
i
was
thinking
when
i
read
that
of
someone
who
would
live
this
house
with
a
bottle
in
his
hand,
go
to
his
club,
meet
with
some
few
of
his
friends
and
have
a
drink.
to
that
extent
i
don’t
know
of
any
regulation,
but
i
would
not
preclude
that
from
being
the
case
in
other
states.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
yes
it
clearly
states
that
on
page
32.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
i
would
have
to
look.
i
know
that
the
court's
opinion
below
is
very
clearly
stated
that
point.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
oh
yes
there
was
no
question
about
that
mr.
chief
justice.
that
was
a
matter
of
public
record
i
should
say
because
it
was
in
the
newspapers
at
that
time.
there
was
--
no
one
had
any
question
about
that
point.
i
do
want
to
finish
the
point
i
was
making
about
whether
or
not
this
license
is
like
water
or
like
electricity.
i
would
sum
that
up
simply
by
saying
that
when
you
have
the
government
providing
or
through
the
governmental
process
some
thing
that
is
being
provided
to
everyone,
you
don’t
have
the
same
thing
as
you
have
with
the
liquor
license
in
pennsylvania.
as
i
mentioned
pennsylvania
has
a
restriction
on
liquor
licenses.
they
aren’t
freely
available.
in
addition
to
that,
the
liquor
license
can
further
certain
special
benefits
as
this
record
very
clearly
shows
by
the
moose
lodge's
own
admissions.
it
would
have
trouble
maintaining
it's
self
according
to
it
and
it's
membership
and
it's
operations,
if
it
didn't
have
this
liquor
license.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
that
is
true,
but
the
heat
or
light
is
supplied
to
you,
to
me
and
to
everyone
else
--
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
that
is
correct,
but
we
think
the
proper
constitutional
line
is
if
the
government
is
doing
something
on
a
special
places,
if
there
are
some
special
benefit,
not
freely
available
to
all
and
this
is
the
case
with
the
liquor
license.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
no,
there
are
many
places
in
pennsylvania
tpday
where
there
are
no
license
is
available
because
the
--
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
well,
i
can
only
go
outside
the
record
mr.
justice
white
on
that
by
telling
you
that
any
recent
case
of
which
i
am
familiar,
when
a
new
municipality
elected
to
have
a
licenses,
there
would
was
such
a
rush
for
club
licenses
that
everyone
was
trampled,
so
there
seems
to
have
no
end
to
the
desire
for
these
restrictive
licenses
in
pennsylvania
just
like
the
fact
that
there
are
4000
--
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
i
would
disqualify
those
who
discriminate
on
grounds
of
race
and
i
want
to
make
it
perfectly
clear,
i
previously
indicated
in
my
answer
to
your
question
that
there
are
certain
clubs
which
discriminate
in
which
racial
discrimination
may
take
place
as
a
consequence
of
a
nature
of
a
discrimination
and
that
makes
discrimination.
it
may
or
may
not
take
place,
but
if
that
ethnic
discrimination
is
reasonable
in
relation
to
the
purposes
of
the
club,
we
are
satisfied
that
that
is
permissible
and
i
don’t
want
to
overlook
in
al
candor
something
that
is
not
mentioned
in
the
brief
of
moose
lodge
and
that
is
there
are
many
clubs.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
there
are
many
clubs
in
that
list
of
elks
that
the
presents
which
you
know
in
our
opinion
would
not
be
precluded
from
getting
a
liquor
license,
but
there
are
many
clubs
which
are
not
in
that
list,
the
local
social
clubs
which
have
no
purpose
in
life
except
social,
there
is
no
basis
for
their
discrimination
except
they
don’t
want
negroes,
those
clubs
would
be
affected
by
this
decision
in
pennsylvania,
there
is
no
question
about
that.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
there
it
is
there
is
a
case
as
i
recall
barton
case
in
this
court
in
which
it
would
have
--
it
would
have
stated
that
the
white
person
who
was
affected
by
the
discrimination
practiced
against
his
black
brother
would
have
a
cost
of
action
against
his
club,
would
have
standing
to
raise
that.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
well,
he
has
the
right
not
to
raise
it
as
well
as
to
raise
it,
but
we
would
have
indicated
that
mr.
ingleheart
who
happened
to
be
the
white
member
who
took
mr.
irvis
to
the
club
would
have
been
able
to
bring
a
case
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
that
is
not
the
direct
issue
here.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
i
don’t
think
that
mr.
irvis
is
harmed
by
a
sanction
against
the
guest
because
there
was
no
sanction.
if
in
fact
the
moose
lodge
(voice
overlap)
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
that
is
true
and
i
think
that
is
mr.
ingleheart,
that
would
be
his
right
of
action
to
raise
it,
just
like
i
think,
yes
sir
mr.
justice
powell?
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
well,
it
really
is
my
position
that
we
are
slowly
reaching
the
point
where
that
will
not
be
allowed.
i
do
not
know
if
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
yet
reached
that
point,
but
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
the
purpose
of
the
club
has
nothing
to
do
with
maleness
to
be
consistent
with
my
position
with
respect
to
the
reasons
for
the
clubs'
existence,
if
it
has
nothing
to
with
maleness
as
such
and
there
is
no
reasonable
ground
for
the
exclusion,
then
the
club
would
have
to
be
put
to
the
test
of
admitting
the
female
or
giving
up
its
license,
but
it
would
not
be
ordered
out
of
hand
to
admit
the
female;
that
is
the
basis
for
the
distinction,
we
are
making
here
between
a
private
club
and
a
public
organization.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
i
just
going
to
have
to
avoid
that
question
i
suppose
the
reasons
for
it
in
one
culture
is
different
from
the
reasons
in
another.
i
understand
in
the
orient
they
don’t
find
those
distinctions
that
we
do.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
the
license
it
self
is
not
expensive.
no
license
is
expensive
itself
as
pennsylvania
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
the
differences
are
only
in
the
fact
that
basically
the
club
has
more
freedom
in
the
use
of
it's
license.
it
can
stay
open
on
sundays
it
can
stay
open
on
election
day,
stay
open
on
sunday
is
great
time
now
pennsylvania
were
to
open
else
where
but
there
is
no
other
great
distinction
between
the
licenses.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
that's
one
of
the
values
certainly
one
of
the
values.
we
think
that
what
we
are
dealing
here,
if
it
please
the
court
with
is
a
matter
of
great
concern
to
the
country.
it's
a
matter
of
whether
of
not
state
supported,
state
aided
discriminations
should
be
permitted.
a
member
of
this
court
i
think
has
stated
it
as
well
as
anyone.
the
state
action
doctrine
reflects
the
profound
judgment
that
denials
of
equal
treatment
and
particularly
denials
on
account
of
race
or
color
are
singularly
grey
when
government
has
or
shares
responsibility
for
them.
government
is
the
social
organ
to
which
all
in
our
society
look
for
the
promotion
of
liberty,
justice,
fair
and
equal
treatment
in
the
setting
of
worthy
norms
and
goals
for
social
conduct.
therefore
something
is
uniquely
amiss
in
a
society
where
the
government,
the
authoritative
article
of
community
values
involves
itself
in
racial
discrimination.
we
see
this
case
as
a
case
which
pennsylvania
by
granting
this
license
to
this
private
club
and
to
other
racially
discriminating
private
clubs
has
involved
itself
in
the
racial
discrimination
of
the
private
club
and
we
urge
this
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
the
state
would
share
mr.
chief
justice
in
the
same
way
that
the
state
would
have
shared
in
barton.
it
helped
to
make
possible
the
existence
and
the
actions
of
the
organization
which
does
the
discriminating.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
that
is
perfectly
alright.
the
state
with
in
not
share
in
the
discrimination
and
that
is
all
we
are
seeking.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
that
is
correct.
we
see
no,
no,
nothing
wrong
in
the
discrimination.
it
is
in
the
state
participation.
thank
you.
