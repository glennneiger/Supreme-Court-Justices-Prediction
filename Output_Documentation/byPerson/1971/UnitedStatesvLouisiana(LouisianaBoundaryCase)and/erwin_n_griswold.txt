mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
motion
in
the
pending
case
of
united
states
against
louisiana.
the
motion
seeks
the
release
of
certain
funds,
which
had
been
impounded
under
an
agreement
entered
into
between
the
united
states
and
louisiana
in
1956.
the
underlying
issue
here
has
been
squarely
decided
by
the
court
at
least
three
times
over
a
period
of
21
years.
in
a
sense,
the
controversy
begins
nearly
25
years
ago
with
the
filing
of
the
suit
by
the
united
states
against
california
which
was
decided
in
332
us
19
in
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
black.
this
court
there
held
that
california
had
no
ownership
right
in
the
land
under
the
seas
beyond
low
water
mark.
although
the
decision
was
applicable
to
california
only,
it
was
based
on
reasoning
which
was
equally
relevant
to
all
other
states
boarding
on
either
of
the
oceans.
and
thereafter
the
united
states
brought
a
suit
against
louisiana
which
was
decided
in
1950,
21
years
ago
in
339
us
and
opinion
by
mr.
justice
douglas.
in
that
case
the
court
held
that
the
united
states
was
entitled
to
a
decree
adjudging
and
declaring
its
paramount
rights
in
the
land
under
the
gulf
of
mexico,
beyond
the
low
water
mark
on
the
coast
of
louisiana.
and
later
in
that
year,
this
court
entered
a
decree
to
this
effect
and
this
is
in
340
us
at
page
899
and
the
decree
reads
“the
united
states
is
now
and
has
been
at
all
times
pertinent
hereto
possessed
a
paramount
rights
in
and
hold
dominion
and
power
over
the
lands,
minnows
and
other
things
under
lying
the
gulf
of
mexico,
lying
seaward
of
the
ordinary
low
water
mark
on
the
coast
of
louisiana
and
outside
of
the
inland
waters.
and
that
is
the
first
time
when
this
court
decided
the
underlying
issue.
that
decree
has
become
as
final
as
any
decree
of
this
court
can
be.
there
are
always
equitable
doctrines
like
bills
of
review
and
cases
can
be
overruled,
but
the
decree
is
a
decree
and
is
outstanding.
in
1953,
congress
passed
the
submerged
lands
act.
this
was
a
reaction,
a
reappraisal
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
california
and
louisiana
case
and
by
this
statute
congress
could
claim
to
all
the
sea
bound
states,
the
land
under
the
sea
adjacent
to
the
states
for
three
miles
from
the
coastline.
it
also
provided
that
the
states
might
have
more
than
three
miles
up
to
nine
miles
where
this
had
been
recognized
by
legislation
prior
to
this
court's
decisions.
in
1956,
oil
leasing
had
become
active
in
the
gulf
of
mexico,
and
there
were
controversies
between
the
united
states
and
louisiana,
and
on
june
11,
1956
this
court
entered
a
decree
enjoining
louisiana
and
the
united
states
from
leasing
or
beginning
the
drilling
of
new
wells
in
the
disputed
tidelands
area,
pending
further
order
of
this
court
unless
by
agreement
of
the
parties
hereto.
this
was
the
background
of
the
agreement
entered
into
later
in
1956,
the
full
text
of
which
it
is
set
out
as
appendix
a
to
the
motion
of
the
united
states
on
page
29
of
that
motion
and
the
funds
involved
here
have
been
impounded
pursuant
to
that
decree.
now
as
i
have
indicated,
the
submerged
land
act
indicated
the
possibility
that
gulf
states
might
have
nine
miles
rather
than
three
miles
and
the
united
states
filed
a
bill
in
equity
against
all
five
of
the
gulf
states
which
i
believe
is
the
suit,
which
is
now
still
pending
here,
and
this
was
decided
by
the
court
in
1960,
united
states
against
louisiana.
the
court
determined
that
texas
and
florida
were
entitled
to
nine
miles
from
their
coast
lines
under
the
submerged
land
act,
but
it
determined
that
and
i
quote
“louisiana
is
entitled
to
submerged
land
rights
to
a
distance
of
no
greater
than
three
geographical
miles
from
the
coastlines
wherever
those
lines
may
ultimately
be
shown
to
be.”
and
a
few
months
later
this
court
entered
its
final
decree
in
that
second
case
of
united
states
against
louisiana
and
that
decree
is
reported
in
364
at
us
502
and
the
irrelevant
portion
reads,
“as
against
the
respective
defendant
states,
the
united
states
is
entitled
to
all
the
lands,
minerals
and
other
natural
resources
underlying
the
gulf
of
mexico
more
than
three
geographic
miles
seaward
from
the
coastlines
of
louisiana,
mississippi
and
alabama
and
that
is
the
second
time
that
this
court
decided
the
issue
which
underlies
the
motion
here.
following
that
decision
in
1965
on
motion
of
the
united
states,
the
court
entered
a
supplemental
decree
providing
for
the
distribution
of
some
of
the
funds
which
have
been
impounded
under
the
agreement
entered
into
between
louisiana
and
the
united
states
in
1956
and
this
supplemental
decree
is
recorded
in
382
us
page
288.
i
am
advised
that
under
it,
about
a
$191
million
was
distributed
to
the
united
states
and
somewhat
over
34
million
dollars
were
distributed
to
louisiana
and
that
decree
i
believe
is
a
clear
precedent
for
the
present
motion.
i
have
here
a
map
too
small
i
am
afraid
to
be
seen
from
the
bench
and
i
will
hand
to
the
clerk
and
ask
that
if
he
pass
to
the
members
of
the
court.
it
is
a
map
which
was
used
and
connection
with
the
argument
three
years
ago
which
led
to
the
third
decision
in
this
case.
on
it
you
will
find
a
green
area
at
the
bottom
and
that
is
the
area
which
was
covered
by
the
order
in
388
--
in
382
us.
just
to
the
north
of
it,
you
see
a
very
faint
line,
that
is
the
so-called
coast
guard
line
that
louisiana
was
claiming,
and
the
green
area
is
three
miles
outside
the
coastguard
line.
close
to
the
shoreline,
you
see
a
pink
area
and
a
red
area.
the
pink
area
is
the
area
of
claimed
by
louisiana.
the
red
area
is
areas
awarded
to
louisiana
by
decision
of
this
court
involving
questions
relating
to
what
are
inland
waters
and
how
and
where
straight
lines
should
be
drawn
across
indentations
and
that
leaves
between
the
pink
area
and
the
green
area
a
gray
area
which
is
essentially
the
area
which
is
involved
here.
i
think
that
this
will
help
the
court
to
see
what
is
involved
here
and
i
will
ask
the
clerk
to
make
it
available.
in
1969,
the
court
decided
the
third
stage
of
this
controversy,
it
is
known
as
the
louisiana
boundary
case
in
394
us.
in
this
decision,
the
court
rejected
the
principal
contention
of
louisiana,
which
was
that
its
coastline
was
to
be
determined
by
the
so-called
coast
guard
line.
the
court
also
decided
a
number
of
other
technical
questions
relating
to
the
coastline
and
referred
the
case
to
mr.
walter
p
armstrong
jr
as
special
master
for
the
purpose
of
resolving
a
relevantly
small
number
of
further
issues,
relating
to
the
location
of
the
coastline
from
which
the
three
miles
granted
to
the
state
by
the
submerged
land
act
is
measured.
in
connection
with
the
hearings
before
the
special
master,
in
response
to
interrogatories,
the
state
of
louisiana
has
conceded
that
it
has
no
claim
to
the
land
specified
in
our
proposed
supplemental
decree.
this
is
stated
in
our
proposed
decree
and
in
a
highly
technical
language
of
geographers,
but
that
designation
is
what
louisiana
has
conceded
that
it
has
no
claim
to
that
land,
that
is
that
it
has
no
claim,
which
it
can
make
consistent
with
this
court's
opinion
of
march
3,
1969,
which
is
the
third
time
that
the
court
has
decided
the
underlying
issue
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
as
i
understand
it,
the
record
is
closed
or
nearly
closed
and
there
will
be
then
arguments
and
decision.
i
think
a
decision
is
expected
sometime
in
the
next,
that
is
a
report
of
the
master
to
this
court,
is
expected
sometime
in
the
1972
term
of
the
court.
and
louisiana
has
conceded
in
those
proceedings
that
with
respect
to
the
territory
covered
by
our
motion,
it
has
no
claim
which
it
can
make
consistent
with
the
court's
several
decisions
which
have
been
entered
in
this
case.
as
we
understand
the
situation,
the
only
substantial
objection
that
louisiana
raises
to
the
present
motion
is
that
the
earlier
decisions
were
wrong
and
should
now
be
reconsidered
and
reversed.
this
of
course
is
contrary
to
the
decisions
which
the
court
has
rendered.
it
is
contrary
to
the
principals
of
law
of
the
case
and
res
judicata
and
should
not
resubmit
by
appropriate
action
which
is
fully
consistent
with
the
decisions
which
the
court
has
rendered
and
which
should
be
held
binding
on
the
state
of
louisiana.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
source
of
the
funds
is
entirely
royalty.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
not
an
issue
here
mr.
justice.
that
line
is
not
the
exact
line
for
which
is
covered
by
this.
that
is
the
line,
which
was
used
in
the
1968
argument
to
indicate
the
claim
of
louisiana.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
you
can
disregard
that
now.
the
map
is
simply
to
illustrate
the
general
area
which
is
covered.
i
think
the
south
line
of
the
map,
three
miles
beyond
the
coast
guard
line
is
precise.
the
north
line
of
the
map
involves
some
areas,
which
are
still
in
dispute
before
the
special
master,
but
the
motion
covers
only
land
which
louisiana
has
conceded
before
the
special
master
that
it
has
no
claim
to,
consistent
with
this
court's
prior
decisions.
at
the
present
time,
i
am
advised
that
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
judge,
i
was
just
about
to
state
that.
at
the
present
time,
i
am
advised
that
about
1
billion,
seven
hundred
million
dollars
are
held
in
the
treasury
of
the
united
states
pursuant
to
the
contract
of
1956.
i
am
further
advised
that
the
amount
covered
by
the
present
motion
is
something
over
1
billion
dollars
and
this
could
be
released
to
the
united
states
if
the
present
motion
is
granted
as
was
done
when
the
first
supplemental
decree
was
entered
in
1965.
this
would
leave
a
balance
of
about
700
million
dollars
still
held
in
suspense
under
the
1956
agreement,
awaiting
the
ultimate
decision
of
this
court
after
the
special
master
has
made
his
report
here.
i
might
find
out
that
the
agreement
calls
for
some
of
the
impounded
funds
to
be
impounded
by
louisiana
that
is
with
respect
to
the
northern
most
zones
and
i
am
not
informed
as
to
what
amount
there
may
be
there.
this
relates
only
to
amounts
now
held
in
the
treasury
of
the
united
states
and
relates
primarily
to
the
disputed
zones,
which
was
zones
two
and
three
under
the
contract
of
1956.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
those
came
from
the
funds
in
the
treasury
of
united
states.
the
190
million
to
the
united
states
related,
i
understand
to
the
green
area
in
the
map.
since
it
appears
to
be,
clear
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
the
amount
covered
by
the
present
motion
is
due
to
the
united
states
without
any
dispute
from
the
louisiana
if
the
decisions
of
this
court
are
to
be
followed.
we
submit
that
the
court
should
enter
the
supplemental
decree
requested
and
make
these
funds
available
for
the
general
purposes
of
the
united
states.
where
the
purpose
of
keeping
funds
in
escrow
has
seized,
the
amount
involved
here
is
too
great
to
be
left
in
limbo.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
understand
there
is
not
mr.
justice.
there
is
some
reference
in
their
briefs
to
problems,
which
might
arise
with
split
leases,
that
is
leases
part
in
and
part
out,
but
we
have
expressly
waived
that
in
our
motion.
the
motion
expressly
provides
that
with
respect
to
any
split
lease,
the
payment
should
not
be
made.
there
is
no
purpose
to
be
served
by
continuing
the
impounding
of
the
funds
held
in
the
treasury.
the
only
valid
equitable
claim
to
them
is
in
the
united
states
and
they
should
be
released
to
the
united
states
in
accordance
with
our
motion
and
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
the
contract
of
1956.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
motion
in
the
pending
case
of
united
states
against
louisiana.
the
motion
seeks
the
release
of
certain
funds,
which
had
been
impounded
under
an
agreement
entered
into
between
the
united
states
and
louisiana
in

the
underlying

here
has

at

over

the
united
states
on
page
29
of
that
motion
and
the
funds
involved
here
have
been
impounded
pursuant
to
that
decree.
now
as
i
have
indicated,
the
submerged
land
act
indicated
the
possibility
that
gulf
states
might
have
nine
miles
rather
than
three
miles
and
the
united
states
filed
a
bill
in
equity
against
all
five
of
the
gulf
states
which
i
believe
is
the
suit,
which
is
now
still
pending
here,
and
this
was
decided
by
the
court
in
1960,
united
states
against
louisiana.
the
court
determined
that
texas
and
florida
were
entitled
to
nine
miles
from
their
coast
lines
under
the
submerged
land
act,
but
it
determined
that
and
i
quote
“louisiana
is
entitled
to
submerged
land
rights
to
a
distance
of
no
greater
than
three
geographical
miles
from
the
coastlines
wherever
those
lines
may
ultimately
be
shown
to
be.”
and
a
few
months
later
this
court
entered
its
final
decree
in
that
second
case
of
united
states
against
louisiana
and
that
decree
is
reported
in
364
at
us
502
and
the
irrelevant
portion
reads,
“as
against
the
respective
defendant
states,
the
united
states
is
entitled
to
all
the
lands,
minerals
and
other
natural
resources
underlying
the
gulf
of
mexico
more
than
three
geographic
miles
seaward
from
the
coastlines
of
louisiana,
mississippi
and
alabama
and
that
is
the
second
time
that
this
court
decided
the
issue
which
underlies
the
motion
here.
following
that
decision
in
1965
on
motion
of
the
united
states,
the
court
entered
a
supplemental
decree
providing
for
the
distribution
of
some
of
the
funds
which
have
been
impounded
under
the
agreement
entered
into
between
louisiana
and
the
united
states
in
1956
and
this
supplemental
decree
is
recorded
in
382
us
page
288.
i
am
advised
that
under
it,
about
a
$191
million
was
distributed
to
the
united
states
and
somewhat
over
34
million
dollars
were
distributed
to
louisiana
and
that
decree
i
believe
is
a
clear
precedent
for
the
present
motion.
i
have
here
a
map
too
small
i
am
afraid
to
be
seen
from
the
bench
and
i
will
hand
to
the
clerk
and
ask
that
if
he
pass
to
the
members
of
the
court.
it
is
a
map
which
was
used
and
connection
with
the
argument
three
years
ago
which
led
to
the
third
decision
in
this
case.
on
it
you
will
find
a
green
area
at
the
bottom
and
that
is
the
area
which
was
covered
by
the
order
in
388
--
in
382
us.
just
to
the
north
of
it,
you
see
a
very
faint
line,
that
is
the
so-called
coast
guard
line
that
louisiana
was
claiming,
and
the
green
area
is
three
miles
outside
the
coastguard
line.
close
to
the
shoreline,
you
see
a
pink
area
and
a
red
area.
the
pink
area
is
the
area
of
claimed
by
louisiana.
the
red
area
is
areas
awarded
to
louisiana
by
decision
of
this
court
involving
questions
relating
to
what
are
inland
waters
and
how
and
where
straight
lines
should
be
drawn
across
indentations
and
that
leaves
between
the
pink
area
and
the
green
area
a
gray
area
which
is
essentially
the
area
which
is
involved
here.
i
think
that
this
will
help
the
court
to
see
what
is
involved
here
and
i
will
ask
the
clerk
to
make
it
available.
in
1969,
the
court
decided
the
third
stage
of
this
controversy,
it
is
known
as
the
louisiana
boundary
case
in
394
us.
in
this
decision,
the
court
rejected
the
principal
contention
of
louisiana,
which
was
that
its
coastline
was
to
be
determined
by
the
so-called
coast
guard
line.
the
court
also
decided
a
number
of
other
technical
questions
relating
to
the
coastline
and
referred
the
case
to
mr.
walter
p
armstrong
jr
as
special
master
for
the
purpose
of
resolving
a
relevantly
small
number
of
further
issues,
relating
to
the
location
of
the
coastline
from
which
the
three
miles
granted
to
the
state
by
the
submerged
land
act
is
measured.
in
connection
with
the
hearings
before
the
special
master,
in
response
to
interrogatories,
the
state
of
louisiana
has
conceded
that
it
has
no
claim
to
the
land
specified
in
our
proposed
supplemental
decree.
this
is
stated
in
our
proposed
decree
and
in
a
highly
technical
language
of
geographers,
but
that
designation
is
what
louisiana
has
conceded
that
it
has
no
claim
to
that
land,
that
is
that
it
has
no
claim,
which
it
can
make
consistent
with
this
court's
opinion
of
march
3,
1969,
which
is
the
third
time
that
the
court
has
decided
the
underlying
issue
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
as
i
understand
it,
the
record
is
closed
or
nearly
closed
and
there
will
be
then
arguments
and
decision.
i
think
a
decision
is
expected
sometime
in
the
next,
that
is
a
report
of
the
master
to
this
court,
is
expected
sometime
in
the
1972
term
of
the
court.
and
louisiana
has
conceded
in
those
proceedings
that
with
respect
to
the
territory
covered
by
our
motion,
it
has
no
claim
which
it
can
make
consistent
with
the
court's
several
decisions
which
have
been
entered
in
this
case.
as
we
understand
the
situation,
the
only
substantial
objection
that
louisiana
raises
to
the
present
motion
is
that
the
earlier
decisions
were
wrong
and
should
now
be
reconsidered
and
reversed.
this
of
course
is
contrary
to
the
decisions
which
the
court
has
rendered.
it
is
contrary
to
the
principals
of
law
of
the
case
and
res
judicata
and
should
not
resubmit
by
appropriate
action
which
is
fully
consistent
with
the
decisions
which
the
court
has
rendered
and
which
should
be
held
binding
on
the
state
of
louisiana.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
source
of
the
funds
is
entirely
royalty.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
not
an
issue
here
mr.
justice.
that
line
is
not
the
exact
line
for
which
is
covered
by
this.
that
is
the
line,
which
was
used
in
the
1968
argument
to
indicate
the
claim
of
louisiana.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
you
can
disregard
that
now.
the
map
is
simply
to
illustrate
the
general
area
which
is
covered.
i
think
the
south
line
of
the
map,
three
miles
beyond
the
coast
guard
line
is
precise.
the
north
line
of
the
map
involves
some
areas,
which
are
still
in
dispute
before
the
special
master,
but
the
motion
covers
only
land
which
louisiana
has
conceded
before
the
special
master
that
it
has
no
claim
to,
consistent
with
this
court's
prior
decisions.
at
the
present
time,
i
am
advised
that
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
judge,
i
was
just
about
to
state
that.
at
the
present
time,
i
am
advised
that
about
1
billion,
seven
hundred
million
dollars
are
held
in
the
treasury
of
the
united
states
pursuant
to
the
contract
of
1956.
i
am
further
advised
that
the
amount
covered
by
the
present
motion
is
something
over
1
billion
dollars
and
this
could
be
released
to
the
united
states
if
the
present
motion
is
granted
as
was
done
when
the
first
supplemental
decree
was
entered
in
1965.
this
would
leave
a
balance
of
about
700
million
dollars
still
held
in
suspense
under
the
1956
agreement,
awaiting
the
ultimate
decision
of
this
court
after
the
special
master
has
made
his
report
here.
i
might
find
out
that
the
agreement
calls
for
some
of
the
impounded
funds
to
be
impounded
by
louisiana
that
is
with
respect
to
the
northern
most
zones
and
i
am
not
informed
as
to
what
amount
there
may
be
there.
this
relates
only
to
amounts
now
held
in
the
treasury
of
the
united
states
and
relates
primarily
to
the
disputed
zones,
which
was
zones
two
and
three
under
the
contract
of
1956.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
those
came
from
the
funds
in
the
treasury
of
united
states.
the
190
million
to
the
united
states
related,
i
understand
to
the
green
area
in
the
map.
since
it
appears
to
be,
clear
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
the
amount
covered
by
the
present
motion
is
due
to
the
united
states
without
any
dispute
from
the
louisiana
if
the
decisions
of
this
court
are
to
be
followed.
we
submit
that
the
court
should
enter
the
supplemental
decree
requested
and
make
these
funds
available
for
the
general
purposes
of
the
united
states.
where
the
purpose
of
keeping
funds
in
escrow
has
seized,
the
amount
involved
here
is
too
great
to
be
left
in
limbo.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
understand
there
is
not
mr.
justice.
there
is
some
reference
in
their
briefs
to
problems,
which
might
arise
with
split
leases,
that
is
leases
part
in
and
part
out,
but
we
have
expressly
waived
that
in
our
motion.
the
motion
expressly
provides
that
with
respect
to
any
split
lease,
the
payment
should
not
be
made.
there
is
no
purpose
to
be
served
by
continuing
the
impounding
of
the
funds
held
in
the
treasury.
the
only
valid
equitable
claim
to
them
is
in
the
united
states
and
they
should
be
released
to
the
united
states
in
accordance
with
our
motion
and
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
the
contract
of
1956.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no.
