mr.
victor
a.
sachse
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
1947,
this
court
held
that
the
united
states
had
paramount
rights
to
the
waters
of
california.
the
united
states
government
claimed
dominion,
claimed
ownership.
this
court
refused
a
decree
declaring
ownership,
but
held
that
california
had
no
title.
in
1950
before
the
congress
could
act,
louisiana
and
texas
were
before
this
court
and
at
that
time,
this
court
held
that
the
california
decision
was
binding.
the
problem
was
not
reviewed
again.
it
was
simply
a
matter
of
following
stare
decisis,
but
the
court
through
justice
douglas,
used
these
words.
that
louisiana
had
no
better
claim
to
the
waters
of
its
coast
than
had
the
original
13
states
or
california
and
having
decided
that
california
had
no
claim
because
the
original
13
states
had
no
claim
so
louisiana
had
none.
i
will
come
back
to
that
in
a
moment
in
connection
with
the
present
litigation
going
on
between
the
united
states
and
the
atlantic
coast
states.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
even
so
sir
i
believe
that
the
reservoir
equity
which
is
in
this
court
and
the
fact
that
no
final
decree
has
been
rendered
in
this
case
must
mean
that
the
matter
is
adjudged
finally
or
there
would
not
be
this
motion
for
a
decree
i
think.
at
any
rate,
if
i
may
briefly
proceed,
i
would
like
to
say
to
your
honors
that
at
this
moment,
this
money
is
in
the
possession
of
the
united
states.
at
this
motion
--
moment,
it
may
be
used
and
doubtless
is
being
used
by
the
united
states
not
just
pursuant
to
the
agreement
of
1956,
but
more
precisely
according
to
section
7
of
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
and
no
interest
is
being
paid
by
the
united
states
to
anyone
in
anyway
on
this
money.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
sir?
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
no
one,
no
one.
the
point
then
mr.
chief
justice
is
when
the
solicitor
general
says
this
is
too
much
money
not
to
be
used,
the
answer
is
that
it
is
being
used
by
the
united
states
and
we
have
the
letter
of
the
chief
of
staff
of
the
joint
committee
on
internal
revenue
taxation
dated
yesterday,
making
very
clear
that
what
i
am
saying
is
correct.
so
the
united
states
is
suffering
nothing
by
allowing
this
money
to
remain
“impounded
in
treasury
of
the
united
states.”
may
i
ask
the
clerk
to
make
this
letter
available
to
you
sir.
if
however,
if
however
this
court
allows
these
funds
to
be
again
i
“released”
because
this
is
only
a
change
of
nomenclature
and
not
a
change
of
fact,
but
if
this
court
allows
these
funds
to
be
released
and
if
afterwards
this
court
decides
that
all
states
of
the
union
are
to
be
treated
alike
and
that
the
atlantic
coast
states
did
indeed
have
territory
into
the
sea
and
that
the
california
decision
was
incorrect,
then
it
would
follow
that
the
decision
later
applied
to
louisiana
is
incorrect
and
this
court
would
surely
wish
to
do
justice.
indeed
justice
douglas,
as
far
back
as
when
the
state
of
rhode
island
taught
of
proceeding
against
louisiana,
warned
the
court
or
admonished
all
of
us
that
the
composition
of
the
court
had
changed
since
the
california
decision,
that
a
majority
of
the
court
might
well
wish
to
review
the
matter,
i
well
conclude
that
the
minority
was
correct
at
that
time
and
that
it
should
not
be
dealt
with
lightly.
so
apparently,
to
us
at
least,
this
court
is
going
to
reconsider
the
matter
because
when
the
united
states
filed
a
motion
against
the
states
of
maine
and
new
hampshire,
massachusetts,
rhode
island,
new
york,
new
jersey,
delaware,
maryland,
virginia,
north
carolina,
south
carolina,
georgia
and
florida
saying
precisely
what
mr.
griswold
has
said
here,
that
is
that
this
matter
had
been
decided
in
the
california
case
and
that
no
state
could
have
more
than
three
miles
into
the
atlantic
ocean
even
under
the
submerged
land
act.
those
states
filed
in
opposition
to
the
motion
of
the
united
states
and
when
this
motion
was
considered
by
your
honors
instead
of
granting
the
motion
of
the
united
states
which
you
might
well
have
done
and
said
that
this
is
stare
decisis
and
the
matter
is
closed,
you
instead
appointed
judge
marris
of
philadelphia
as
a
special
master
to
receive
evidence
on
the
very
point.
louisiana
had
asked
and
the
record
shows
and
our
memorandum
refers
to
it,
in
the
early
days
of
this
litigation
as
far
back
as
1956,
to
take
testimony
on
the
meaning
of
the
colonies
and
of
louisiana
and
of
la
salle
and
of
france
in
that
declarations
with
respect
to
the
literal
states
of
the
union
as
to
whether
there
was
an
area
into
the
seas
that
belonged
to
them
naturally.
the
court
denied
that
motion,
but
the
same
thing
is
now
occurring,
your
honors,
before
three
special
masters
appointed
by
this
court.
number
one,
in
our
own
case,
the
very
case
that
is
before
your
honors
now,
you
said
through
justice
stewart
that
in
the
matter
of
determining
the
historic
waters
of
louisiana,
we
said
several
things,
you
said
that
obviously
the
louisiana
coast
was
such
a
one
and
should
have
the
benefit
of
straight
base
lines
but
that
was
up
to
the
president
and
the
congress,
but
you
said
that
although
that
government
could
adjure
straight
base
lines
to
the
prejudice
of
louisiana,
it
could
not
adjure
historic
waters
to
the
prejudice
of
louisiana
and
the
words
of
the
court
are
beautiful
words.
they
are
that
in
this
phase
of
the
case,
louisiana
shall
act
as
if
it
represented
the
nation
and
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
shall
act
as
if
he
represents
an
opposing
foreign
power
and
the
reason
is
so
clear
because
the
issue
is
now,
whether
the
united
states
will
cast
away,
will
give
away
areas
that
no
other
nation
in
the
world
claims
and
solely
for
the
purpose
of
winning
these
submerged
mineral
resources
which
in
any
event
will
be
for
the
benefit
of
the
united
states.
whether
we
consider
it
a
benefit
of
the
united
states
federal
government
or
the
benefit
of
the
united
states
through
state
governments,
no
one
gets
these
resources,
but
we
americans.
but
it
is
wrong
to
give
away
territory
of
the
united
states
to
a
composite
and
this
court
through
justice
stewart
said
that
in
this
phase
of
the
case,
we
act
as
if
we
represent
the
national
interest.
now
we
have
not
conceded,
we
have
not
conceded
that
these
areas
belong
to
the
united
states.
we
took
the
greatest
of
pains
to
prevent
making
any
such
concession,
but
to
do
mr.
griswold
justice,
we
did
say
it
substantially
as
he
has
recited
to
the
court.
what
we
said
and
i
know
you
rules
do
not
favor
reading,
but
this
will
be
short.
louisiana
has
objected
to
answering
broadly
phrased
interrogatories
submitted
by
the
united
states,
which
relate
to
matters
not
pertinent
to
the
issues
that
are
before
the
special
master.
you
referred
about
eight
or
nine
specific
issues
to
this
special
master,
thereafter
the
case
to
be
returned
to
this
court,
and
you
retained
jurisdiction
to
dispose
these
and
we
said
we
should
not
get
involved
in
a
diversionary
matter.
our
sole
intention
should
be
given
to
resolving
the
matters
before
the
special
master.
you
also
by
referring
it
to
a
special
master
opened
the
doors
to
louisiana
for
the
first
time
to
really
produce
evidence
and
we
are
doing.
let
me
give
you
some
of
the
evidence
that
we
are
producing.
first
of
all,
we
were
able
to
get
over
serious
objection
of
the
government,
a
letter
from
mr.
lee
rankin
in
1960
when
he
was
the
solicitor
general
and
when
he
was
referring
to
concessions,
concessions
in
the
term
of
agreements
really,
we
had
argued
that
the
adjacent
islands
to
louisiana
and
the
reference
to
the
adjacent
islands
meant
that
we
were
to
have
a
territory
out
to
the
islands
and
right
at
this
spot,
mr.
rankins
said
we
concede
that
these
areas
belong
to
louisiana
as
in
the
orders
not
for
the
reason
mr.
sachse
has
argued,
but
for
the
reason
that
these
islands
are
set
as
to
the
shelter
to
the
coast,
and
therefore
the
areas
within
them
are
inland
waters.
then
the
state
department
wanted
him
to
retain
and
the
correspondence
shows
that
he
refused
to
retain,
that
is
one
item
of
evidence
going
to
the
special
master.
another
item
of
evidence,
which
we
had
no
knowledge
of
in
the
1960
case,
but
which
we
now
know
of,
is
an
exchange
of
correspondence
between
mr.
bogs,
the
historian
of
the
state
department
and
mr.
valance
the
legal
officer
of
the
state
department
in
which
they
explicitly
say
that
spain
claimed
six
miles
into
the
gulf
of
mexico,
originally
spain
had
claimed
the
gulf
of
mexico,
but
at
the
critical
time,
that
is
in
1760,
spain
was
claiming
six
miles
into
the
gulf
of
mexico.
we
did
not
know
this.
we
did
not
have
access
to
these
records
until
the
present
matter
was
referred
to
the
special
master.
this
was
not
in
published
documents,
this
correspondence.
this
is
what
we
have
obtained.
there
are
other
matters
now
being
reviewed
in
camera
by
mr.
armstrong,
matters
that
the
government
has
declined
to
make
available
to
us
and
we
do
not
know
what
they
will
show,
or
how
much
seaward
they
will
extend
out
boundaries,
but
they
are
being
examined
now
by
mr.
armstrong,
a
special
master
in
camera
and
we
say
it
is
unjust
in
the
extreme
to
quote
“release”
this
money
so
that
when
louisiana
wins
it
will
win
a
parte
victory
because
we
would
then
have
to
go
to
the
congress
for
an
appropriation
to
give
us
this
money,
which
is
not
the
situation
now.
as
long
as
the
government
uses
the
money,
without
interest,
but
under
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
and
the
agreement
of
1956,
it
uses
it
as
fully
as
if
its
title
was
established
to
it,
but
if
we
win
as
we
hope
to
do,
i
believe
we
shall,
then
we
could
get
it
without
an
act
of
congress,
not
otherwise.
now
this
is
the
justice,
this
is
the
equity
of
the
case;
this
is
the
balancing
that
this
court
provided.
you
wrote
rule
60
and
before
rule
60
was
ever
written,
this
court
said
and
we
cite
the
cases
in
our
brief,
that
justice
could
always
be
done
by
a
court,
which
had
jurisdiction
of
the
case
as
you
have.
if
you
were
a
district
court
of
the
united
states,
your
directions
to
district
courts
would
enable
that
district
court
to
do
justice
in
this
matter
because
we
are
here
under
your
original
jurisdiction.
you
have
said
that
rule
9
of
your
rules
that
you
will
apply
as
far
as
possible
the
rules
of
the
district
court,
the
rules
of
civil
procedures
and
we
say
that
you
have
retained
jurisdiction
in
this
case
and
this
money
should
remain
here
until
the
matter
is
closed.
i
come
back
now
to
the
basic
problem
of
the
atlantic
coast
states.
remember,
if
this
court
in
1947
had
said
that
the
13
original
colonies
had
territory
into
the
sea
as
they
came
into
the
union,
this
court
would
have
said
that
equal
footing
clause
would
give
california
a
right
into
the
sea.
necessarily
so
because
you
said
that
the
absence
of
the
right
of
the
13
colonies
meant
that
the
equal
footing
clause
prevented
california
from
having
such
a
right.
when
we
were
before
the
court
and
i
have
been
in
other
cases
for
louisiana,
in
1950
you
simply
said,
louisiana
has
no
better
claim
than
the
13
original
states.
judge
marris
in
philadelphia
last
week
was
receiving
testimony
from
men
of
high
renown
in
our
country
from
professor
howard
from
harvard,
from
professor
kirk
patrick
of
brown,
from
mr.
joesph
who
for
nine
years
served
on
the
court
of
international
justice
at
hague
and
they
have
testified
so
far
without
contradiction
though
the
opportunity
of
the
solicitor
general
to
contradict
them
has
not
yet
arisen
as
letting
the
states
finish
their
case
before
the
government
puts
on
its
case,
but
so
far,
they
are
making
it
perfectly
clear
by
expert
testimony
which
is
justified
by
reason
of
a
difficulty
of
finding
the
sources
for
opinions
in
this
matter.
that
after
time
the
unites
states
who
is
established
as
a
separate
nation,
it
was
recognized
by
england
and
by
the
colonies
and
by
international
law
generally
that
where
recession
of
a
territory
changed
and
act
of
conveyance
said
certain
land
and
islands
within
a
certain
distance
of
the
coast,
it
meant
that
these
islands,
that
distance
marked
a
territorial
periphery
and
that
indeed
the
treaty
with
the
united
states
and
england
in
1783
referring
to
islands
within
20
leagues
of
the
coast
meant
that
american
territory
on
the
atlantic
ocean
which
was
the
only
place
we
had
any
went
that
far.
now
we
dropped
back
somewhat.
we
have
dropped
back.
finally
we
are
claiming
three
miles
generally
but
not
for
some
purposes
for
fishing
for
other
things
we
claim
greater
distances,
we
recognize
that
there,
we
being
united
states
recognize
that
there
is
no
international
line
in
any
distance
that
anyone
will
recognize.
we
know
that
russia
for
example
claims
12
miles
at
least.
we
know
that
our
limiting
our
claims
to
three
miles
is
not
going
to
make
russia
limit
her
claims
to
three
miles.
we
know
that
there
is
any
one
rule
so
the
important
thing
is
to
determine
what
was
the
understanding
of
statesman
and
congressmen
or
maybe
the
one
time
that
covers
them
both
at
the
time
of
the
formation
of
our
country
and
fairly
according
to
the
testimony
of
mr.
joseph,
it
is
that
with
this
reference
to
islands
within
so
many
leagues
of
coast
meant
that
territory
goes
that
far.
if,
if
and
when
that
case
reaches
you,
you
decide
that
that
is
the
correct
view.
this
was
not
view
the
court
accepted
so
far,
but
if
the
court
then
accepts
that
view
and
decides
that
the
atlantic
coast
states
did
indeed
have
waters
into
the
sea,
that
therefore
they
do
now
have
waters
into
the
sea.
will
you
not
want
to
say
the
same
thing
to
louisiana?
the
sole
claim
for
france,
the
seas
and
the
ports
and
the
bays
and
the
lands
in
1682
as
precisely
and
as
explicitly
as
george
iii
or
any
other
english
king
ever
provided
in
any
pattern
or
any
conveyance
to
any
of
the
atlantic
states
and
if
you
say
as
i
hope
you
will
and
as
the
atlantic
coast
states
hope
you
will,
that
they
are
right,
i
have
no
right
or
wish
to
argue
for
them
and
i
do
not.
but
if
you
then
say
that
that
is
the
correct
rule
of
law
with
respect
to
our
great
nation
and
the
states
which
form
it
and
that
when
this
federal
government
acts
in
international
affairs,
as
it
and
not
the
states
can
do
so
then
it
acts
for
the
benefit
and
not
to
the
decrement
of
the
states
then
i
think
you
will
want
to
say
as
justice
douglas
said
in
an
earlier
case
in
a
dissent
in
the
1960
case
that
certainly,
if
texas
is
recognized
as
three
leagues
into
the
sea
so
should
louisiana
be
recognized
and
now
i
want
to
say
one
more
thing,
i
believe
i
have
a
few
minutes
left.
under
the
submerged
land
act,
there
are
two
criterion.
one,
what
did
you
have
when
you
came
into
the
union?
two,
what
has
congress
recognized
since?
and
the
reason
for
those
two
criterion
is
that
none
of
the
states
of
our
great
union
had
an
explicit
water
boundary
as
it
came
into
the
union.
so,
if
we
view
louisiana
as
a
french
colony,
which
it
was
at
the
time
of
the
purchase
in
1803,
which
it
was
at
the
time
of
discovery
until
1763
then
there
would
be
a
historic
claim
to
three
leagues
which
we
believe
this
court
meant
to
preserve
our
historic
claims
until
this
case
is
finally
litigated.
if
you
consider
that
we
were
a
spanish
colony
because
we
were
a
spanish
colony
from
1763
to
1803,
the
french
and
indian
war
until
napoleon
was
triumphant
then
you
would
recognize
as
a
state
department
has
recognized
the
spanish
claim
of
six
miles.
then
you
would
say,
i
would
hope,
that
considering
what
has
happened
after
louisiana
came
into
the
union
recognition,
i
hope
you
would
say
that
the
treaty
of
1819,
the
treaty
of
amity
recognized
that
the
spanish
boundary
was
the
mountain
boundary,
the
boundary
separating
the
two,
that
this
boundary
went
into
the
sea.
now
we
failed
in
1860
to
show
how
far
into
the
sea
it
went
but
certain
of
the
evidence
now
before
mr.
armstrong
that
will
be
before
all
of
the
special
masters
before
the
matter
is
closed,
will
convince
anyone
that
at
least
it
went
the
spanish
six
miles
if
not
the
french
three
leagues
into
the
sea
and
we
say
to
you
we
know
that
your
decisions
to
this
point
are
against
us.
we
hope
that
your
refusal
of
the
judgment
to
the
united
states
against
the
atlantic
coast
states
means
that
you
will
reconsider
the
matter
for
them
and
if
you
consider
the
matter
for
them,
then
the
basis
of
this
whole
situation
may
well
be
changed.
we
ask
you
please
to
preserve
the
status
quo,
to
preserve
the
duress
until
you
are
ready
to
make
your
decision
with
all
of
the
evidence
before
you.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
right
and
we
have
been
asking
to.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
our
answer
to
the
request
for
admissions
we
explicitly
said
mr.
justice
stewart
precisely
what
you
are
saying
now.
we
said
we
answered
these
interrogatories
and
these
requests
for
admissions
within
the
limit
of
the
matters
referred
to
him
by
the
court
which
gives
mr.
griswold
the
right
to
say
that
we
are
saying
this
is
the
most
that
we
can
claim
under
the
--
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
under
the
record,
but
we
said
the
supreme
court
has
retained
jurisdiction,
the
supreme
court
is
entertaining
motions
concerning
the
atlantic
coast
states.
we
propose
to
bring
this
up
again,
we
reserve
our
rights
to
do
so
and
we
are
not
empowered
to
concede
anything,
to
give
away
any
louisiana
territory
and
we
do
not
give
away
any
louisiana
territory.
mr.
armstrong
is
receiving
the
evidence
we
give
and
that
the
government
has
very
few
objections
to
evidence
you
have
been
sustained.
how
he
will
rule
we
do
not
know
and
i
do
not
propose
to
stand
here
and
say
how
he
will
rule.
how
judge
marris
will
rule.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
what,
we
do
not
know
what
--
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
what
we
hope
we
will
develop
is
the
thing
that
you
reserve
to
us,
i
say
you
because
you
speak
for
the
court.
reserved
us
in
a
decision,
that
is
to
prove
that
in
effect
if
we
could
that
the
united
states
had
in
effect
drawn
straight
base
lines
that
the
united
states
had
in
effect
recognized
the
waters
we
claim
as
internal
waters
and
the
first
extend
of
them
begins
the
line
from
which
we
measure
the
three
miles
or
three
leagues.
so,
if
we
are
at
our
six,
whatever
the
measurement
may
be,
but
we
have
to
get
to
the
base
line
of
measurement
and
you
also
said
that
he
could
respect
our
historic
water
within
bays
and
for
example
sir,
and
this
is
the
most
important
thing
if
we
prove
that
east
bay
is
historic,
then
our
line
of
three
miles
or
whatever
the
measure
will
be,
will
be
from
the
line
closing
the
bay
and
closing
all
of
the
bay.
we
are
confronted
with
the
most
amazing
thing
about
these
bays.
you
who
are
on
the
court
now
and
were
on
the
court
in
1960
remember
the
concession
and
you
who
were
on
the
court
in
1969
discussed
that
concession
and
you
know
that
the
government
withdrew
its
concession
as
to
kayou
bay,
but
you
gave
us
a
right
to
prove
if
we
can
factually
the
kayou
bay
is
nevertheless
internal
waters.
well
it
would
amaze
you
to
see
the
lines
that
the
federal
government
would
draw
for
kayou
bay
shaped
like
my
hand
as
to
what
are
internal
waters
and
what
are
international
waters.
you
would
have
a
little
scar
going
in
and
out
of
international
waters
within
this
inland
bay.
you
would
have
the
strangest
situation
where
russia,
mexico,
japan,
anyone
could
operate
in
international
waters
in
kayou
bay,
but
they
have
to
be
careful
because
going
from
the
island
to
the
land
from
the
land
to
the
island,
they
would
have
twice
to
cross,
twice
to
cross
inland
waters.
it
would
be
as
if
maryland
and
virginia
had
a
sliver
of
international
waters
running
through
chesapeake
bay.
now
we
hope
to
knock
this
out
and
we
hope
to
knock
it
out
by
geography,
by
history,
by
the
actions
of
the
government.
we
do
now
know
now
what
is
in
camera.
if
we
could
see
it
we
might
have
many
more
things
to
say
to
this
court
and
we
ask
you
to
preserve
the
race
until
the
facts
can
be
determined.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
1947,
this
court
held
that
the
united
states
had
paramount
rights
to
the
waters
of
california.
the
united
states
government
claimed
dominion,
claimed
ownership.
this
court
refused
a
decree
declaring
ownership,
but
held
that
california
had
no
title.
in
1950
before
the
congress
could
act,
louisiana
and
texas
were
before
this
court
and
at
that
time,
this
court
held
that
the
california
decision
was
binding.
the
problem
was
not
reviewed
again.
it
was
simply
a
matter
of
following
stare
decisis,
but
the
court
through
justice
douglas,
used
these
words.
that
louisiana
had
no
better
claim
to
the
waters
of
its
coast
than
had
the
original
13
states
or
california
and
having
decided
that
california
had
no
claim
because
the
original
13
states
had
no
claim
so
louisiana
had
none.
i
will
come
back
to
that
in
a
moment
in
connection
with
the
present
litigation
going
on
between
the
united
states
and
the
atlantic
coast
states.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
even
so
sir
i
believe
that
the
reservoir
equity
which
is
in
this
court
and
the
fact
that
no
final
decree
has
been
rendered
in
this
case
must
mean
that
the
matter
is
adjudged
finally
or
there
would
not
be
this
motion
for
a
decree
i
think.
at
any
rate,
if
i
may
briefly
proceed,
i
would
like
to
say
to
your
honors
that
at
this
moment,
this
money
is
in
the
possession
of
the
united
states.
at
this
motion
--
moment,
it
may
be
used
and
doubtless
is
being
used
by
the
united
states
not
just
pursuant
to
the
agreement
of
1956,
but
more
precisely
according
to
section
7
of
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
and
no
interest
is
being
paid
by
the
united
states
to
anyone
in
anyway
on
this
money.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
sir?
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
no
one,
no
one.
the
point
then
mr.
chief
justice
is
when
the
solicitor
general
says
this
is
too
much
money
not
to
be
used,
the
answer
is
that
it
is
being
used
by
the
united
states
and
we
have
the
letter
of
the
chief
of
staff
of
the
joint
committee
on
internal
revenue
taxation
dated
yesterday,
making
very
clear
that
what
i
am
saying
is
correct.
so
the
united
states
is
suffering
nothing
by
allowing
this
money
to
remain
“impounded
in
treasury
of
the
united
states.”
may
i
ask
the
clerk
to
make
this
letter
available
to
you
sir.
if
however,
if
however
this
court
allows
these
funds
to
be
again
i
“released”
because
this
is
only
a
change
of
nomenclature
and
not
a
change
of
fact,
but
if
this
court
allows
these
funds
to
be
released
and
if
afterwards
this
court
decides
that
all
states
of
the
union
are
to
be
treated
alike
and
that
the
atlantic
coast
states
did
indeed
have
territory
into
the
sea
and
that
the
california
decision
was
incorrect,
then
it
would
follow
that
the
decision
later
applied
to
louisiana
is
incorrect
and
this
court
would
surely
wish
to
do
justice.
indeed
justice
douglas,
as
far
back
as
when
the
state
of
rhode
island
taught
of
proceeding
against
louisiana,
warned
the
court
or
admonished
all
of
us
that
the
composition
of
the
court
had
changed
since
the
california
decision,
that
a
majority
of
the
court
might
well
wish
to
review
the
matter,
i
well
conclude
that
the
minority
was
correct
at
that
time
and
that
it
should
not
be
dealt
with
lightly.
so
apparently,
to
us
at
least,
this
court
is
going
to
reconsider
the
matter
because
when
the
united
states
filed
a
motion
against
the
states
of
maine
and
new
hampshire,
massachusetts,
rhode
island,
new
york,
new
jersey,
delaware,
maryland,
virginia,
north
carolina,
south
carolina,
georgia
and
florida
saying
precisely
what
mr.
griswold
has
said
here,
that
is
that
this
matter
had
been
decided
in
the
california
case
and
that
no
state
could
have
more
than
three
miles
into
the
atlantic
ocean
even
under
the
submerged
land
act.
those
states
filed
in
opposition
to
the
motion
of
the
united
states
and
when
this
motion
was
considered
by
your
honors
instead
of
granting
the
motion
of
the
united
states
which
you
might
well
have
done
and
said
that
this
is
stare
decisis
and
the
matter
is
closed,
you
instead
appointed
judge
marris
of
philadelphia
as
a
special
master
to
receive
evidence
on
the
very
point.
louisiana
had
asked
and
the
record
shows
and
our
memorandum
refers
to
it,
in
the
early
days
of
this
litigation
as
far
back
as
1956,
to
take
testimony
on
the
meaning
of
the
colonies
and
of
louisiana
and
of
la
salle
and
of
france
in
that
declarations
with
respect
to
the
literal
states
of
the
union
as
to
whether
there
was
an
area
into
the
seas
that
belonged
to
them
naturally.
the
court
denied
that
motion,
but
the
same
thing
is
now
occurring,
your
honors,
before
three
special
masters
appointed
by
this
court.
number
one,
in
our
own
case,
the
very
case
that
is
before
your
honors
now,
you
said
through
justice
stewart
that
in
the
matter
of
determining
the
historic
waters
of
louisiana,
we
said
several
things,
you
said
that
obviously
the
louisiana
coast
was
such
a
one
and
should
have
the
benefit
of
straight
base
lines
but
that
was
up
to
the
president
and
the
congress,
but
you
said
that
although
that
government
could
adjure
straight
base
lines
to
the
prejudice
of
louisiana,
it
could
not
adjure
historic
waters
to
the
prejudice
of
louisiana
and
the
words
of
the
court
are
beautiful
words.
they
are
that
in
this
phase
of
the
case,
louisiana
shall
act
as
if
it
represented
the
nation
and
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
shall
act
as
if
he
represents
an
opposing
foreign
power
and
the
reason
is
so
clear
because
the
issue
is
now,
whether
the
united
states
will
cast
away,
will
give
away
areas
that
no
other
nation
in
the
world
claims
and
solely
for
the
purpose
of
winning
these
submerged
mineral
resources
which
in
any
event
will
be
for
the
benefit
of
the
united
states.
whether
we
consider
it
a
benefit
of
the
united
states
federal
government
or
the
benefit
of
the
united
states
through
state
governments,
no
one
gets
these
resources,
but
we
americans.
but
it
is
wrong
to
give
away
territory
of
the
united
states
to
a
composite
and
this
court
through
justice
stewart
said
that
in
this
phase
of
the
case,
we
act
as
if
we
represent
the
national
interest.
now
we
have
not
conceded,
we
have
not
conceded
that
these
areas
belong
to
the
united
states.
we
took
the
greatest
of
pains
to
prevent
making
any
such
concession,
but
to
do
mr.
griswold
justice,
we
did
say
it
substantially
as
he
has
recited
to
the
court.
what
we
said
and
i
know
you
rules
do
not
favor
reading,
but
this
will
be
short.
louisiana
has
objected
to
answering
broadly
phrased
interrogatories
submitted
by
the
united
states,
which
relate
to
matters
not
pertinent
to
the
issues
that
are
before
the
special
master.
you
referred
about
eight
or
nine
specific
issues
to
this
special
master,
thereafter
the
case
to
be
returned
to
this
court,
and
you
retained
jurisdiction
to
dispose
these
and
we
said
we
should
not
get
involved
in
a
diversionary
matter.
our
sole
intention
should
be
given
to
resolving
the
matters
before
the
special
master.
you
also
by
referring
it
to
a
special
master
opened
the
doors
to
louisiana
for
the
first
time
to
really
produce
evidence
and
we
are
doing.
let
me
give
you
some
of
the
evidence
that
we
are
producing.
first
of
all,
we
were
able
to
get
over
serious
objection
of
the
government,
a
letter
from
mr.
lee
rankin
in
1960
when
he
was
the
solicitor
general
and
when
he
was
referring
to
concessions,
concessions
in
the
term
of
agreements
really,
we
had
argued
that
the
adjacent
islands
to
louisiana
and
the
reference
to
the
adjacent
islands
meant
that
we
were
to
have
a
territory
out
to
the
islands
and
right
at
this
spot,
mr.
rankins
said
we
concede
that
these
areas
belong
to
louisiana
as
in
the
orders
not
for
the
reason
mr.
sachse
has
argued,
but
for
the
reason
that
these
islands
are
set
as
to
the
shelter
to
the
coast,
and
therefore
the
areas
within
them
are
inland
waters.
then
the
state
department
wanted
him
to
retain
and
the
correspondence
shows
that
he
refused
to
retain,
that
is
one
item
of
evidence
going
to
the
special
master.
another
item
of
evidence,
which
we
had
no
knowledge
of
in
the
1960
case,
but
which
we
now
know
of,
is
an
exchange
of
correspondence
between
mr.
bogs,
the
historian
of
the
state
department
and
mr.
valance
the
legal
officer
of
the
state
department
in
which
they
explicitly
say
that
spain
claimed
six
miles
into
the
gulf
of
mexico,
originally
spain
had
claimed
the
gulf
of
mexico,
but
at
the
critical
time,
that
is
in
1760,
spain
was
claiming
six
miles
into
the
gulf
of
mexico.
we
did
not
know
this.
we
did
not
have
access
to
these
records
until
the
present
matter
was
referred
to
the
special
master.
this
was
not
in
published
documents,
this
correspondence.
this
is
what
we
have
obtained.
there
are
other
matters
now
being
reviewed
in
camera
by
mr.
armstrong,
matters
that
the
government
has
declined
to
make
available
to
us
and
we
do
not
know
what
they
will
show,
or
how
much
seaward
they
will
extend
out
boundaries,
but
they
are
being
examined
now
by
mr.
armstrong,
a
special
master
in
camera
and
we
say
it
is
unjust
in
the
extreme
to
quote
“release”
this
money
so
that
when
louisiana
wins
it
will
win
a
parte
victory
because
we
would
then
have
to
go
to
the
congress
for
an
appropriation
to
give
us
this
money,
which
is
not
the
situation
now.
as
long
as
the
government
uses
the
money,
without
interest,
but
under
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
and
the
agreement
of
1956,
it
uses
it
as
fully
as
if
its
title
was
established
to
it,
but
if
we
win
as
we
hope
to
do,
i
believe
we
shall,
then
we
could
get
it
without
an
act
of
congress,
not
otherwise.
now
this
is
the
justice,
this
is
the
equity
of
the
case;
this
is
the
balancing
that
this
court
provided.
you
wrote
rule
60
and
before
rule
60
was
ever
written,
this
court
said
and
we
cite
the
cases
in
our
brief,
that
justice
could
always
be
done
by
a
court,
which
had
jurisdiction
of
the
case
as
you
have.
if
you
were
a
district
court
of
the
united
states,
your
directions
to
district
courts
would
enable
that
district
court
to
do
justice
in
this
matter
because
we
are
here
under
your
original
jurisdiction.
you
have
said
that
rule
9
of
your
rules
that
you
will
apply
as
far
as
possible
the
rules
of
the
district
court,
the
rules
of
civil
procedures
and
we
say
that
you
have
retained
jurisdiction
in
this
case
and
this
money
should
remain
here
until
the
matter
is
closed.
i
come
back
now
to
the
basic
problem
of
the
atlantic
coast
states.
remember,
if
this
court
in
1947
had
said
that
the
13
original
colonies
had
territory
into
the
sea
as
they
came
into
the
union,
this
court
would
have
said
that
equal
footing
clause
would
give
california
a
right
into
the
sea.
necessarily
so
because
you
said
that
the
absence
of
the
right
of
the
13
colonies
meant
that
the
equal
footing
clause
prevented
california
from
having
such
a
right.
when
we
were
before
the
court
and
i
have
been
in
other
cases
for
louisiana,
in
1950
you
simply
said,
louisiana
has
no
better
claim
than
the
13
original
states.
judge
marris
in
philadelphia
last
week
was
receiving
testimony
from
men
of
high
renown
in
our
country
from
professor
howard
from
harvard,
from
professor
kirk
patrick
of
brown,
from
mr.
joesph
who
for
nine
years
served
on
the
court
of
international
justice
at
hague
and
they
have
testified
so
far
without
contradiction
though
the
opportunity
of
the
solicitor
general
to
contradict
them
has
not
yet
arisen
as
letting
the
states
finish
their
case
before
the
government
puts
on
its
case,
but
so
far,
they
are
making
it
perfectly
clear
by
expert
testimony
which
is
justified
by
reason
of
a
difficulty
of
finding
the
sources
for
opinions
in
this
matter.
that
after
time
the
unites
states
who
is
established
as
a
separate
nation,
it
was
recognized
by
england
and
by
the
colonies
and
by
international
law
generally
that
where
recession
of
a
territory
changed
and
act
of
conveyance
said
certain
land
and
islands
within
a
certain
distance
of
the
coast,
it
meant
that
these
islands,
that
distance
marked
a
territorial
periphery
and
that
indeed
the
treaty
with
the
united
states
and
england
in
1783
referring
to
islands
within
20
leagues
of
the
coast
meant
that
american
territory
on
the
atlantic
ocean
which
was
the
only
place
we
had
any
went
that
far.
now
we
dropped
back
somewhat.
we
have
dropped
back.
finally
we
are
claiming
three
miles
generally
but
not
for
some
purposes
for
fishing
for
other
things
we
claim
greater
distances,
we
recognize
that
there,
we
being
united
states
recognize
that
there
is
no
international
line
in
any
distance
that
anyone
will
recognize.
we
know
that
russia
for
example
claims
12
miles
at
least.
we
know
that
our
limiting
our
claims
to
three
miles
is
not
going
to
make
russia
limit
her
claims
to
three
miles.
we
know
that
there
is
any
one
rule
so
the
important
thing
is
to
determine
what
was
the
understanding
of
statesman
and
congressmen
or
maybe
the
one
time
that
covers
them
both
at
the
time
of
the
formation
of
our
country
and
fairly
according
to
the
testimony
of
mr.
joseph,
it
is
that
with
this
reference
to
islands
within
so
many
leagues
of
coast
meant
that
territory
goes
that
far.
if,
if
and
when
that
case
reaches
you,
you
decide
that
that
is
the
correct
view.
this
was
not
view
the
court
accepted
so
far,
but
if
the
court
then
accepts
that
view
and
decides
that
the
atlantic
coast
states
did
indeed
have
waters
into
the
sea,
that
therefore
they
do
now
have
waters
into
the
sea.
will
you
not
want
to
say
the
same
thing
to
louisiana?
the
sole
claim
for
france,
the
seas
and
the
ports
and
the
bays
and
the
lands
in
1682
as
precisely
and
as
explicitly
as
george
iii
or
any
other
english
king
ever
provided
in
any
pattern
or
any
conveyance
to
any
of
the
atlantic
states
and
if
you
say
as
i
hope
you
will
and
as
the
atlantic
coast
states
hope
you
will,
that
they
are
right,
i
have
no
right
or
wish
to
argue
for
them
and
i
do
not.
but
if
you
then
say
that
that
is
the
correct
rule
of
law
with
respect
to
our
great
nation
and
the
states
which
form
it
and
that
when
this
federal
government
acts
in
international
affairs,
as
it
and
not
the
states
can
do
so
then
it
acts
for
the
benefit
and
not
to
the
decrement
of
the
states
then
i
think
you
will
want
to
say
as
justice
douglas
said
in
an
earlier
case
in
a
dissent
in
the
1960
case
that
certainly,
if
texas
is
recognized
as
three
leagues
into
the
sea
so
should
louisiana
be
recognized
and
now
i
want
to
say
one
more
thing,
i
believe
i
have
a
few
minutes
left.
under
the
submerged
land
act,
there
are
two
criterion.
one,
what
did
you
have
when
you
came
into
the
union?
two,
what
has
congress
recognized
since?
and
the
reason
for
those
two
criterion
is
that
none
of
the
states
of
our
great
union
had
an
explicit
water
boundary
as
it
came
into
the
union.
so,
if
we
view
louisiana
as
a
french
colony,
which
it
was
at
the
time
of
the
purchase
in
1803,
which
it
was
at
the
time
of
discovery
until
1763
then
there
would
be
a
historic
claim
to
three
leagues
which
we
believe
this
court
meant
to
preserve
our
historic
claims
until
this
case
is
finally
litigated.
if
you
consider
that
we
were
a
spanish
colony
because
we
were
a
spanish
colony
from
1763
to
1803,
the
french
and
indian
war
until
napoleon
was
triumphant
then
you
would
recognize
as
a
state
department
has
recognized
the
spanish
claim
of
six
miles.
then
you
would
say,
i
would
hope,
that
considering
what
has
happened
after
louisiana
came
into
the
union
recognition,
i
hope
you
would
say
that
the
treaty
of
1819,
the
treaty
of
amity
recognized
that
the
spanish
boundary
was
the
mountain
boundary,
the
boundary
separating
the
two,
that
this
boundary
went
into
the
sea.
now
we
failed
in
1860
to
show
how
far
into
the
sea
it
went
but
certain
of
the
evidence
now
before
mr.
armstrong
that
will
be
before
all
of
the
special
masters
before
the
matter
is
closed,
will
convince
anyone
that
at
least
it
went
the
spanish
six
miles
if
not
the
french
three
leagues
into
the
sea
and
we
say
to
you
we
know
that
your
decisions
to
this
point
are
against
us.
we
hope
that
your
refusal
of
the
judgment
to
the
united
states
against
the
atlantic
coast
states
means
that
you
will
reconsider
the
matter
for
them
and
if
you
consider
the
matter
for
them,
then
the
basis
of
this
whole
situation
may
well
be
changed.
we
ask
you
please
to
preserve
the
status
quo,
to
preserve
the
duress
until
you
are
ready
to
make
your
decision
with
all
of
the
evidence
before
you.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
right
and
we
have
been
asking
to.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
our
answer
to
the
request
for
admissions
we
explicitly
said
mr.
justice
stewart
precisely
what
you
are
saying
now.
we
said
we
answered
these
interrogatories
and
these
requests
for
admissions
within
the
limit
of
the
matters
referred
to
him
by
the
court
which
gives
mr.
griswold
the
right
to
say
that
we
are
saying
this
is
the
most
that
we
can
claim
under
the
--
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
under
the
record,
but
we
said
the
supreme
court
has
retained
jurisdiction,
the
supreme
court
is
entertaining
motions
concerning
the
atlantic
coast
states.
we
propose
to
bring
this
up
again,
we
reserve
our
rights
to
do
so
and
we
are
not
empowered
to
concede
anything,
to
give
away
any
louisiana
territory
and
we
do
not
give
away
any
louisiana
territory.
mr.
armstrong
is
receiving
the
evidence
we
give
and
that
the
government
has
very
few
objections
to
evidence
you
have
been
sustained.
how
he
will
rule
we
do
not
know
and
i
do
not
propose
to
stand
here
and
say
how
he
will
rule.
how
judge
marris
will
rule.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
what,
we
do
not
know
what
--
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
what
we
hope
we
will
develop
is
the
thing
that
you
reserve
to
us,
i
say
you
because
you
speak
for
the
court.
reserved
us
in
a
decision,
that
is
to
prove
that
in
effect
if
we
could
that
the
united
states
had
in
effect
drawn
straight
base
lines
that
the
united
states
had
in
effect
recognized
the
waters
we
claim
as
internal
waters
and
the
first
extend
of
them
begins
the
line
from
which
we
measure
the
three
miles
or
three
leagues.
so,
if
we
are
at
our
six,
whatever
the
measurement
may
be,
but
we
have
to
get
to
the
base
line
of
measurement
and
you
also
said
that
he
could
respect
our
historic
water
within
bays
and
for
example
sir,
and
this
is
the
most
important
thing
if
we
prove
that
east
bay
is
historic,
then
our
line
of
three
miles
or
whatever
the
measure
will
be,
will
be
from
the
line
closing
the
bay
and
closing
all
of
the
bay.
we
are
confronted
with
the
most
amazing
thing
about
these
bays.
you
who
are
on
the
court
now
and
were
on
the
court
in
1960
remember
the
concession
and
you
who
were
on
the
court
in
1969
discussed
that
concession
and
you
know
that
the
government
withdrew
its
concession
as
to
kayou
bay,
but
you
gave
us
a
right
to
prove
if
we
can
factually
the
kayou
bay
is
nevertheless
internal
waters.
well
it
would
amaze
you
to
see
the
lines
that
the
federal
government
would
draw
for
kayou
bay
shaped
like
my
hand
as
to
what
are
internal
waters
and
what
are
international
waters.
you
would
have
a
little
scar
going
in
and
out
of
international
waters
within
this
inland
bay.
you
would
have
the
strangest
situation
where
russia,
mexico,
japan,
anyone
could
operate
in
international
waters
in
kayou
bay,
but
they
have
to
be
careful
because
going
from
the
island
to
the
land
from
the
land
to
the
island,
they
would
have
twice
to
cross,
twice
to
cross
inland
waters.
it
would
be
as
if
maryland
and
virginia
had
a
sliver
of
international
waters
running
through
chesapeake
bay.
now
we
hope
to
knock
this
out
and
we
hope
to
knock
it
out
by
geography,
by
history,
by
the
actions
of
the
government.
we
do
now
know
now
what
is
in
camera.
if
we
could
see
it
we
might
have
many
more
things
to
say
to
this
court
and
we
ask
you
to
preserve
the
race
until
the
facts
can
be
determined.
