what
does
the
state
have
to
show
to
declare
dependent,
the
children
of
a
widow
or
widower?
justice
byron

white
well,
let
us
assume
they
were
married
and
mother
is
dead
and
the
father
is
indigent,
he
cannot
--?
justice
byron

white
but
they
have
to
prove
neglect?
justice
byron
r.
white
indigency
is
no
--
is
not
enough?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
there
are
other
state
funds
to
support
him
and
his
child
together?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
under
the
statute
he
is
not
a
parent,
is
that
it?
he
is
not
being
the
parent.
justice
byron
r.
white
his
only
recourse
here
is
possibly
to
be
appointed
a
guardian
or
to
adopt
the
children?
justice
byron

white
alright,
but
let
us
say
even
if
he
could?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
would
be
a
guardian
not
a
parent.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
he
adopted
them
he
could
become
a
parent?m
justice
byron
r.
white
the
state
says
that
the
unwed
father
has
limited
responsibilities
for
the
child
until
and
unless
he
adopts
or
something
like
that
and
hence
that
justifies
treating
him
differently.
but
what
is
the
--
how
are
his
responsibilities
different
from
the
unwed
mother’s
responsibilities
vis-à-vis
the
child?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let
us
assume
the
state
--
under
the
state
law
though
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
an
unwed
father
until
he
adopted
the
child
had
no
obligations
to
support
the
child,
let
us
just
assume
that,
but
that
the
mother
was
treated
as
a
parent
with
those
responsibilities,
would
not
that
be
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
would
--
justice
byron
r.
white
tell
me
under
the
illinois
law,
what
responsibility
does
the
unwed
have
for
his
child?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
for
medical
--
for
medicine?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
education?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
food
and
shelter?
justice
byron
r.
white
clothes?
well,
then
what
are
we
talking
about,
what
is
the
difference
between
the
married
and
the
unmarried?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
unmarried
father
under
illinois
law
is
not
subject
the
criminal
penalty
associated
with
neglect?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
maybe
so
but
you
still
have
to
reach
the
question
of
why
does
illinois
treat
the
man
different
from
the
woman
in
this
respect?
i
mean,
this
is
sort
of
a
bootstrap
argument.
we
do
not
make
him
responsible,
therefore,
we
treat
him
differently
and
because
we
make
the
woman
responsible
we
can
treat
her
differently?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do
not
think
the
woman
would
have
an
equal
protection
claim
who
said
that
she
should
not
be
criminally
penalized
for
certain
acts
when
the
father
of
the
child
is
not
subjected
to
same
(inaudible)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
should
it
impose
in
terms
the
welfare
of
the
child,
why
should
it
impose
the
same
obligation
on
the
male?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that
was
irrelevant
too
under
the
illinois
law
because
he
is
a
father,
he
is
not
a
parent.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
saying
until
he
has
proved
to
be
the
parent
the
equal
protection
point
is
not
right
for
any
parent,
does
he
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
of
course
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
but
here
the
unwed
father
cannot
adopt
just
like
going
in
and
saying
but
i
want
to
adopt
and
i
want
to
--
i
will
file
a
piece
of
paper
that
i
accept
all
the
responsibilities
that
you
are
saying
i
do
not
have.
the
state
--
he
cannot
just
do
that
and
just
have
it
for
the
asking.
he
must
shoulder
a
substantial
burden
of
proof
to
show
his
fitness
and
his
capability
in
taking
care
of
the
children.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that
is
--
but
we
are
still
talking
about
the
position
of
the
father
with
respect
to
the
unwed
mother,
the
position
of
the
father
with
respect
to
say
they
divorced,
the
divorced
father
and
several
other
categories?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
the
state
must
concede
that
there
is
a
quite
a
category
of
unwed
fathers
that
are
going
to
abandon
their
children
or
who
refuse
to
act
with
respect
to
them
like
a
parent
and
you
must
concede
that
there
is
quite
a
category
of
unwed
mothers
who
abandon
their
children?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
yet
we
treat
all
unwed
mothers
in
one
way
and
all
unwed
fathers
in
quite
a
different
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
would
not
do
him
any
good
in
this
dependency
hearing
to
say,
look
i
am
fit.
i
am
ready
to
assume
all
the
responsibilities
that
you
want
me
to
assume.
that
is
just
irrelevant.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
say
that
the
state
should
consider
him
as
the
children
--
apparently
the
interest
in
the
children
were
irrelevant
in
this
proceeding
in
the
sense
that
they
taken
from
what
is
conceived
to
be
the

and
given
to
some

justice
byron

well,
they
were
declared

were
appointed
for

the

the
state,
as

of
this

automatically

legally
forbade
his
