mr.
morton
e.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioner
before
this
court
seeks
automatic
legal
control
of
these
persons
--
these
children
assumed
to
be
his.
the
state
demands
only
that
if
he
has
to
gain
legal
rights
over
them
and
if
he
is
to
impose
upon
them,
legal
responsibilities
towards
him
that
he
do
so
by
means
of
an
adoption
proceeding
comparable
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
to
a
marriage,
a
normal
marriage
between
husband
and
wife.
marriage
at
least
in
part,
is
a
contract
between
the
parties
and
between
the
state
in
which
the
parties
undertake
from
the
moment
of
the
birth
of
a
child
of
the
union,
legal
responsibility
not
just
for
the
support
of
the
child
as
is
the
case
with
an
unwed
father,
but
legal
responsibility
for
a
wide
range
of
human
activities,
including
the
schooling
of
the
child,
the
medical
care
and
needs
of
the
child,
criminal
penalties
against
abandoning
the
child.
through
the
adoption
proceeding,
the
state
is
asking
that
the
petitioner
stanley
signify
his
willingness
to
accept
those
same
responsibilities
which
are
imposed
upon
all
females
who
bear
children
--
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
and
upon
marriage.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
only
monetary
sir.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
yes
sir.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
yes.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
the
married
father
cannot
take
his
children,
cannot
abandon
his
children,
cannot
walk
away
from
them
on
the
street.
the
married
father
cannot
permit
his
children
to
associate
in
a
place
of
prostitution
or
with
thieves.
a
married
father
is
responsible
for
attending
to
the
medical
care
of
the
children
not
just
providing
the
money
by
which
someone
else
can
accomplish
that
at
or
have
been
--
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
that
is
correct
sir.
he
has
no
criminal
penalties
attached
under
the
laws
relating
to
financial
support
of
the
child.
through
an
adoption
proceeding,
he
would
be
regarded
as
a
parent
and
he
would
have
imposed
upon
him
all
the
responsibilities
of
that
parenthood.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
because
of
the
fact
sir
that
through
a
combination
both
of
history,
cultural
patterns
and
real
physical
differences
between
the
sexes
they
are
different
sir.
it
is
the
position
of
the
state
that,
it
is
a
combination
of
these
factors,
no
one
of
which
we
think
can
be
isolated.
there
are
real
differences
between
male
and
female,
differences
in
their
abilities
and
drives
directed
toward
child
rearing.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
no
sir,
she
would
have
no
such
claim
unlike
the
case,
the
invidious
discriminations
of
race
or
religion
in
which
the
classification
is
unrelated
to
a
permissible
state
objective.
the
classification
here
imposing
upon
her
burdens
is
related
to
the
permissible
or
compelling
state
objective
of
promoting
the
welfare
of
the
child.
if
the
state
imposes
on
the
female
the
obligations
that
it
does
not
impose
on
the
married
male
--
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
because
unlike
the
case
of
married
male
and
female
in
which
the
parties
have
signified
their
willingness
to
work
together
to
the
rearing
of
the
children,
the
male
and
female
in
this
case
may
or
may
not
be
willing
to
work
together
towards
the
common
end
of
child
rearing.
what
the
state
would
be
doing
if
it
imposed
upon
the
petitioner
the
demand
that
he
accept
all
the
responsibilities
of
parenthood
is
to
interject
him
into
the
family
of
the
mother
and
child
and
to
create
two
conflicting
parties
competing
for
legal
control
of
the
child.
the
situation
does
not
arise
in
the
marriage
simply
--
at
least
initially
because
the
parties
have
signified
their
willingness
to
work
together.
since
it
is
necessary
to
impose
upon
at
least
one
of
the
parties,
legal
responsibility
for
the
welfare
of
children
and
since
necessarily
the
female
is
present
at
the
birth
of
the
child
and
identifiable
as
the
mother,
unlike
the
case
of
the
married
father
where
the
law
presumes
quite
overwhelmingly
that
he
is
in
fact
the
father
of
the
children
born
to
his
spouse,
unlike
that
case
as
to
the
unmarried
father
there
are
no
presumptions
as
to
who
the
father
is,
there
is
an
unknown
factor
except
as
the
female
may
state
who
the
father
is.
in
the
case
of
the
father
who
is
married
to
a
woman
other
than
the
mother
of
the
child
requiring
a
putative
father
to
accept
all
the
responsibilities
of
a
married
father
is
to
in
effect
create
multi-family
units
and
destroy
the
nuclear
family
as
we
know
it
today.
one
cannot
impose
on
the
unmarried
father,
or
the
father
who
is
unmarried
to
the
mother
of
the
child
responsibilities
or
in
rights
without
giving
him
responsibilities
to
require
the
state
to
impose
on
a
potentially
hostile
father
responsibilities
outside
of
his
own
marriage
unit
is
to
tamper
with
the
family
as
we
know
it
in
society
today.
i
would
submit
that
that
was
one
of
factors
in
the
case
of
levine
versus
vincent
upon
which
the
court
based
its
decision.
unlike
the
case
of
race
or
religion,
the
distinctions
between
male
and
female
are
real.
they
are
founded
upon
biological
and
historic
facts
which
are
valid
today.
there
have
been
a
number
of
suggestions
as
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
only
fact
that
was
relevant
in
the
juvenile
court
below
was
whether
or
not
peter
stanley
was
the
legal
father
as
defined
by
statute.
no
other
fact
was
relevant
to
the
inquiry
below.
no
suggestion
was
made
as
to
the
constitutionality
or
lack
of
it
of
the
statutes.
the
question
of
the
proofs
involved
were
thereby
not
relevant
and
are
not
properly
before
this
court.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
contrary
i
am
suggesting
that
the
only
fact
that
this
court
can
take
cognizance
of
is
that
peter
stanley,
the
petitioner
was
not
married
to
the
mother
of
the
children.
the
need
for
a
proceeding
--
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
no
sir,
not
at
all.
the
fact
that
he
had
been
found
to
be
the
father
of
the
child
would
not
give
him
any
greater
rights
than
he
has
under
the
present
state.
the
problem
remains
however
that
there
has
been
no
proof
that
peter
stanley,
in
this
record
there
has
been
no
proof
that
peter
stanley
in
fact
is
the
father
of
these
children.
he
may
well
be
--
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
that
is
correct
sir,
which
i
suggest
that
by
noting
that
there
has
to
be
a
judicial
proceeding
to
determine
the
rights
of
one
who
claims
to
be
a
legal
father
over
the
children
and
who
would
seek
to
gain
legal
control
over
them.
as
the
matter
now
stands
peter
stanley
claims
to
be
the
father,
he
maybe
if
in
a
proper
proceeding
for
adoption
or
guardianship
he
asserts
his
parenthood.
if
he
asserts
his
18
years
supposedly
of
living
with
the
children
these
matters
may
be
very
relevant
to
a
determination
of
what
would
be
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child.
we
suggest
that
is
the
only
relevant
consideration.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
that
is
correct
sir.
the
--
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
the
illinois
supreme
court
did
not
pass
directly
on
the
matter
noting
that
petitioner
had
not
challenged
it
in
the
lower
court
and
left
him
to
his
remedy
of
applying
for
adoption
or
guardianship.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
correct
sir.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
yes
sir.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
only
if
this
court
does
not
accept
the
determination
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
that
since
the
petitioner
stanley
--
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
yes
sir.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
but
this
court
need
not
to
accept
as
a
fact
that
the
petitioner
stanley
as
a
matter
of
fact
is
the
father
of
the
children.
otherwise
any
party
who
claims
to
be
the
father
of
the
children
whether
in
fact
he
was
or
not
would
have
the
same
right
as
peter
stanley
to
bring
the
case
before
the
court.
the
state
in
this
case
does
not
nor
has
it
interfered
with
the
relationship
of
those
people
who
would
seek
with
or
without
marriage
to
rear
children.
the
statute
in
this
case
by
not
imposing
has
no
parents
upon
the
children
of
a
union
whether
in
or
out
of
wedlock
is
seeking
but
to
secure
for
the
welfare
of
these
children
one
responsible
parent
to
account
to
the
state
for
their
welfare.
we
think
this
interest
compelling.
we
think
it
the
most
compelling
interest
the
state
may
have.
the
petition
in
this
case
reads
as
a
neglect
petition
although
it
is
not
so.
the
petition
as
originally
filed
was
not
a
dependency
petition.
it
was
filed
as
a
neglect
petition.
the
question
of
stanley’s
visitation
is
not
before
this
court.
in
fact,
he
has
been
visiting
the
children
pending
the
outcome
of
this
case.
nor
is
the
question
of
the
petitioner’s
indigency
before
the
court,
the
question
not
being
raised
by
stanley
in
the
court
below.
we
submit
both
based
on
history
or
culture,
the
very
real
differences
of
between
male
and
female
and
very
real
differences
between
the
married
father
and
the
unmarried
father,
in
terms
of
their
interest
in
children
and
their
legal
responsibilities
for
their
children,
that
the
statute
here
fulfills
the
compelling
governmental
objective
of
protecting
children
born
in
or
out
of
wedlock
and
not
to
be
affirmed.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
only
that
through
a
combination
of
historical
circumstances
brought
about
sir
at
least
in
part
by
virtue
of
physical
differences
between
the
sexes.
it
is
a
pattern
within
our
society
that
the
woman
is
primarily
responsible
in
the
rearing
of
the
young
children.
the
state
has
properly
taken
cognizance
of
this
existing
condition
which
is
a
result
of
real
differences
between
male
and
female
married
and
unmarried
males.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
no
sir.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
no
sir,
(voice
overlap)
it
is
merely
a
product
of
those
--
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan
and
it
is
the
holding
of
white
versus
florida.
we
think
that
holding,
particularly
as
noted
by
dr.
mead
(ph)
on
the
following
page
quote
by
quote
is
significant
in
the
sense
that
it
is
a
real
fact
of
life
that
as
a
combination
of
these
circumstances
none
of
which
can
be
neatly
isolated,
that
is
a
combination
of
these
men
and
women
do
not
have
the
same
direct
interest
in
child
rearing,
that
the
illinois
legislature
has
properly
taken
cognizance
of
these
very
real
differences
which
have
never
been
suggested
to
the
other
than
real
differences
in
child
rearing.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
mr.
justice
marshall,
he
would
then
be
classified
as
a
legal
parent
and
entitled
automatically
the
custody
and
control
of
them.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
yes
sir.
he
would
be
--
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
no,
he
did
not
change
one
bit.
he
performed
a
legal
act
that
imposed
on
him
by
law
responsibility
for
the
children
beyond
mere
money
payments
by
the
act
of
marriage.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
he
change
not
at
all
but
by
the
act
the
marrying
the
woman
he
became
liable
under
law
for
more
responsibilities
than
he
had
before.
he
became
liable
for
the
schooling,
for
sending
the
child
to
school.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
that
peter
stanley
be
now
after
marriage
is
legally
responsible
for
his
welfare
and
as
to
the
child,
that
the
child
has
legal
duties
towards
peter
stanley.
he
is
responsible
at
the
time
of
the
legal
relationship
to
support
the
adult
parent
who
cannot
support
himself.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
not
at
all
justice
marshall.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
i
am
--
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
yes,
mr.
justice
and
in
addition
he
is
responsible
too
not
desert
and
tend
for
the
children.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
by
the
adoption
formality
which
is
exactly
comparable
in
this
case
to
the
formality
of
the
marriage
ceremony
he
is
merely
undertaking
the
same
rights
as
a
male
does
by
the
act
of
marriage.
but
more
importantly,
with
a
human
being
who
is
in
existence
when
a
person
gains
the
rights
of
parenthood
over
the
child,
there
is
imposed
by
illinois
law,
legal
responsibility
on
the
child.
to
impose
these
responsibilities
without
consulting
the
interest
of
the
child
either
by
the
desire
of
the
child’s
natural
mother
in
marriage
or
by
the
supervision
of
the
courts
in
an
adoption
proceeding,
to
impose
legal
responsibility
on
a
child
after
he
is
in
existence
to
care
for
an
adult
parent
and
to
do
so,
automatically,
without
consulting
the
interest
of
the
child
is
to
deny
that
child
due
process
of
law.
when
the
child
gains
a
parent,
he
gains
legal
responsibilities.
it
may
or
may
not
be
in
his
best
interest
to
gain
those
legal
responsibilities
toward
his
parent.
that
problem
does
not
exist
between
a
married
couple
where
the
female
gives
birth
to
the
child
because
the
state
imposes
from
the
moment
of
birth
onward
those
reciprocal
rights
and
duties
between
male
and
female,
between
the
children
to
the
parents
and
the
parents
to
the
children.
the
adoption
proceeding
which
the
state
has
required
is
but
a
substitute
for
that
marriage
ceremony,
that
social
contract
with
the
state
where
the
parties
have
agreed
to
accept
those
responsibilities.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
white
but
to
give
the
father
the
children
for
the
asking
of
him
to
make
their
legal
custody
and
control
dependent
only
on
the
will
of
the
father
is
to
make
the
children
chattels
and
to
deny
to
the
children
any
opportunity
and
with
that
in
person
--
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
but
those
--
but
the
unwed
father
while
he
does
have
a
biological
relationship
or
he
may
have
with
the
children
that
is
not
the
determining
factor.
parenthood
is
more
than
biology
and
it
is
more
than
support.
it
encompasses
within
our
society
a
very
wide
range
of
human
activities.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
initially
i
would
observe.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
in
answer
to
your
last
question
mr.
justice
white.
no,
it
would
not
do
him
any
good
to
merely
lay
an
automatic
claim
to
the
children.
the
state
would
require
their
interest
to
be
consulted
before
they
are
handed
over
like
shuttles
chattels
to
the
father.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
and
the
fact
that
the
woman
is
necessarily
present
when
the
child
is
born,
she
is
there
and
identifiable.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
in
fact
the
paternity
is
not
relevant
to
that.
it
is
in
case
and
that
sense
the
concession
is
irrelevant
so
whether
or
not
the
state
has
made
it.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
because
in
that
case
--
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
because
in
the
case
of
the
case
of
the
married
couple,
the
father
will
generally
participate
not
in
the
act
of
birth
but
from
that
time
on
in
caring
with
the
child.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
no
mr.
chief
justice.
most
respectfully
illinois
encourages
him
to
do
so
if
he
will
accept
the
legal
responsibility
for
those
children
by
a
formal
proceeding
comparable
to
the
marriage
ceremony
in
which
he
is
evidencing
through
a
judicial
proceeding
his
desire
to
accept
legal
responsibility
for
the
children.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
no
sir.
i
would
not
agree
to
that
and
the
suggestions
on
the
record
that
would
tend
to
indicate
that
were
not
relevant
to
the
trial
court
below.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
no
sir,
they
were
not
--
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
that
is
correct,
but
it
is
the
petitioner
stanley
who
placed
the
children
with
the
nesses.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
the
nesses,
whether
that
was
done
--
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
no
sir.
the
state
imposed
upon
the
nesses,
the
parties
he
had
physically
deposited
the
children
with
upon
some
person
the
state
imposed
legal
responsibility.
stanley
did
not
ask
for
custody,
he
did
not
ask
for
legal
responsibility.
he
only
objected
to
someone
having
legal
control
over
the
children.
the
question
of
his
prior
relationship,
the
question
of
his
paternity
or
lack
of
it
or
his
misconduct
or
lack
of
it
was
not
part
of
the
trial
below
and
is
not
relevant
to
outcome
of
this
case.
it
is
purely
the
question
of
the
act
of
discrimination.
in
requesting
the
nesses
to
accept
that
legal
responsibility,
the
custodians
he
had
given
the
children
to,
the
state
was
merely
attempting
to
secure
the
welfare
of
the
children
by
providing
a
criminal
penalty
for
anyone
who
would
abandon
a
child.
stanley
was
--
did
not
ask
to
have
them.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
i
would
submit
that
to
be
a
mere
inadvertence
sir.
the
adoption
is
clearly
open
as
an
alternative
to
stanley
in
this
case.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
there
is
no
state
which
imposes
upon
the
unwed
father
the
full
range
of
parental
responsibility
and
there
is
no
state
which
grants
the
unwed
father
outside
of
a
common
law
marriage
state
the
full
range
of
legal
rights
of
parenthood.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioner
before
this
court
seeks
automatic
legal
control
of
these
persons
--
these
children
assumed
to
be
his.
the
state
demands
only
that
if
he
has
to
gain
legal
rights
over
them
and
if
he
is
to
impose
upon
them,
legal
responsibilities
towards
him
that
he
do
so
by
means
of
an
adoption
proceeding
comparable
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
to
a
marriage,
a
normal
marriage
between
husband
and
wife.
marriage
at
least
in
part,
is
a
contract
between
the
parties
and
between
the
state
in
which
the
parties
undertake
from
the
moment
of
the
birth
of
a
child
of
the
union,
legal
responsibility
not
just
for
the
support
of
the
child
as
is
the
case
with
an
unwed
father,
but
legal
responsibility
for
a
wide
range
of
human
activities,
including
the
schooling
of
the
child,
the
medical
care
and
needs
of
the
child,
criminal
penalties
against
abandoning
the
child.
through
the
adoption
proceeding,
the
state
is
asking
that
the
petitioner
stanley
signify
his
willingness
to
accept
those
same
responsibilities
which
are
imposed
upon
all
females
who
bear
children
--
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
and
upon
marriage.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
only
monetary
sir.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
yes
sir.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
yes.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
the
married
father
cannot
take
his
children,
cannot
abandon
his
children,
cannot
walk
away
from
them
on
the
street.
the
married
father
cannot
permit
his
children
to
associate
in
a
place
of
prostitution
or
with
thieves.
a
married
father
is
responsible
for
attending
to
the
medical
care
of
the
children
not
just
providing
the
money
by
which
someone
else
can
accomplish
that
at
or
have
been
--
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
that
is
correct
sir.
he
has
no
criminal
penalties
attached
under
the
laws
relating
to
financial
support
of
the
child.
through
an
adoption
proceeding,
he
would
be
regarded
as
a
parent
and
he
would
have
imposed
upon
him
all
the
responsibilities
of
that
parenthood.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
because
of
the
fact
sir
that
through
a
combination
both
of
history,
cultural
patterns
and
real
physical
differences
between
the
sexes
they
are
different
sir.
it
is
the
position
of
the
state
that,
it
is
a
combination
of
these
factors,
no
one
of
which
we
think
can
be
isolated.
there
are
real
differences
between
male
and
female,
differences
in
their
abilities
and
drives
directed
toward
child
rearing.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
no
sir,
she
would
have
no
such
claim
unlike
the
case,
the
invidious
discriminations
of
race
or
religion
in
which
the
classification
is
unrelated
to
a
permissible
state
objective.
the
classification
here
imposing
upon
her
burdens
is
related
to
the
permissible
or
compelling
state
objective
of
promoting
the
welfare
of
the
child.
if
the
state
imposes
on
the
female
the
obligations
that
it
does
not
impose
on
the
married
male
--
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
because
unlike
the
case
of
married
male
and
female
in
which
the
parties
have
signified
their
willingness
to
work
together
to
the
rearing
of
the
children,
the
male
and
female
in
this
case
may
or
may
not
be
willing
to
work
together
towards
the
common
end
of
child
rearing.
what
the
state
would
be
doing
if
it
imposed
upon
the
petitioner
the
demand
that
he
accept
all
the
responsibilities
of
parenthood
is
to
interject
him
into
the
family
of
the
mother
and
child
and
to
create
two
conflicting
parties
competing
for
legal
control
of
the
child.
the
situation
does
not
arise
in
the
marriage
simply
--
at
least
initially
because
the
parties
have
signified
their
willingness
to
work
together.
since
it
is
necessary
to
impose
upon
at
least
one
of
the
parties,
legal
responsibility
for
the
welfare
of
children
and
since
necessarily
the
female
is
present
at
the
birth
of
the
child
and
identifiable
as
the
mother,
unlike
the
case
of
the
married
father
where
the
law
presumes
quite
overwhelmingly
that
he
is
in
fact
the
father
of
the
children
born
to
his
spouse,
unlike
that
case
as
to
the
unmarried
father
there
are
no
presumptions
as
to
who
the
father
is,
there
is
an
unknown
factor
except
as
the
female
may
state
who
the
father
is.
in
the
case
of
the
father
who
is
married
to
a
woman
other
than
the
mother
of
the
child
requiring
a
putative
father
to
accept
all
the
responsibilities
of
a
married
father
is
to
in
effect
create
multi-family
units
and
destroy
the
nuclear
family
as
we
know
it
today.
one
cannot
impose
on
the
unmarried
father,
or
the
father
who
is
unmarried
to
the
mother
of
the
child
responsibilities
or
in
rights
without
giving
him
responsibilities
to
require
the
state
to
impose
on
a
potentially
hostile
father
responsibilities
outside
of
his
own
marriage
unit
is
to
tamper
with
the
family
as
we
know
it
in
society
today.
i
would
submit
that
that
was
one
of
factors
in
the
case
of
levine
versus
vincent
upon
which
the
court
based
its
decision.
unlike
the
case
of
race
or
religion,
the
distinctions
between
male
and
female
are
real.
they
are
founded
upon
biological
and
historic
facts
which
are
valid
today.
there
have
been
a
number
of
suggestions
as
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
only
fact
that
was
relevant
in
the
juvenile
court
below
was
whether
or
not
peter
stanley
was
the
legal
father
as
defined
by
statute.
no
other
fact
was
relevant
to
the
inquiry
below.
no
suggestion
was
made
as
to
the
constitutionality
or
lack
of
it
of
the
statutes.
the
question
of
the
proofs
involved
were
thereby
not
relevant
and
are
not
properly
before
this
court.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
contrary
i
am
suggesting
that
the
only
fact
that
this
court
can
take
cognizance
of
is
that
peter
stanley,
the
petitioner
was
not
married
to
the
mother
of
the
children.
the
need
for
a
proceeding
--
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
no
sir,
not
at
all.
the
fact
that
he
had
been
found
to
be
the
father
of
the
child
would
not
give
him
any
greater
rights
than
he
has
under
the
present
state.
the
problem
remains
however
that
there
has
been
no
proof
that
peter
stanley,
in
this
record
there
has
been
no
proof
that
peter
stanley
in
fact
is
the
father
of
these
children.
he
may
well
be
--
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
that
is
correct
sir,
which
i
suggest
that
by
noting
that
there
has
to
be
a
judicial
proceeding
to
determine
the
rights
of
one
who
claims
to
be
a
legal
father
over
the
children
and
who
would
seek
to
gain
legal
control
over
them.
as
the
matter
now
stands
peter
stanley
claims
to
be
the
father,
he
maybe
if
in
a
proper
proceeding
for
adoption
or
guardianship
he
asserts
his
parenthood.
if
he
asserts
his
18
years
supposedly
of
living
with
the
children
these
matters
may
be
very
relevant
to
a
determination
of
what
would
be
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child.
we
suggest
that
is
the
only
relevant
consideration.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
that
is
correct
sir.
the
--
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
the
illinois
supreme
court
did
not
pass
directly
on
the
matter
noting
that
petitioner
had
not
challenged
it
in
the
lower
court
and
left
him
to
his
remedy
of
applying
for
adoption
or
guardianship.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
correct
sir.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
yes
sir.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
only
if
this
court
does
not
accept
the
determination
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
that
since
the
petitioner
stanley
--
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
yes
sir.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
but
this
court
need
not
to
accept
as
a
fact
that
the
petitioner
stanley
as
a
matter
of
fact
is
the
father
of
the
children.
otherwise
any
party
who
claims
to
be
the
father
of
the
children
whether
in
fact
he
was
or
not
would
have
the
same
right
as
peter
stanley
to
bring
the
case
before
the
court.
the
state
in
this
case
does
not
nor
has
it
interfered
with
the
relationship
of
those
people
who
would
seek
with
or
without
marriage
to
rear
children.
the
statute
in
this
case
by
not
imposing
has
no
parents
upon
the
children
of
a
union
whether
in
or
out
of
wedlock
is
seeking
but
to
secure
for
the
welfare
of
these
children
one
responsible
parent
to
account
to
the
state
for
their
welfare.
we
think
this
interest
compelling.
we
think
it
the
most
compelling
interest
the
state
may
have.
the
petition
in
this
case
reads
as
a
neglect
petition
although
it
is
not
so.
the
petition
as
originally
filed
was
not
a
dependency
petition.
it
was
filed
as
a
neglect
petition.
the
question
of
stanley’s
visitation
is
not
before
this
court.
in
fact,
he
has
been
visiting
the
children
pending
the
outcome
of
this
case.
nor
is
the
question
of
the
petitioner’s
indigency
before
the
court,
the
question
not
being
raised
by
stanley
in
the
court
below.
we
submit
both
based
on
history
or
culture,
the
very
real
differences
of
between
male
and
female
and
very
real
differences
between
the
married
father
and
the
unmarried
father,
in
terms
of
their
interest
in
children
and
their
legal
responsibilities
for
their
children,
that
the
statute
here
fulfills
the
compelling
governmental
objective
of
protecting
children
born
in
or
out
of
wedlock
and
not
to
be
affirmed.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
only
that
through
a
combination
of
historical
circumstances
brought
about
sir
at
least
in
part
by
virtue
of
physical
differences
between
the
sexes.
it
is
a
pattern
within
our
society
that
the
woman
is
primarily
responsible
in
the
rearing
of
the
young
children.
the
state
has
properly
taken
cognizance
of
this
existing
condition
which
is
a
result
of
real
differences
between
male
and
female
married
and
unmarried
males.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
no
sir.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
no
sir,
(voice
overlap)
it
is
merely
a
product
of
those
--
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan
and
it
is
the
holding
of
white
versus
florida.
we
think
that
holding,
particularly
as
noted
by
dr.
mead
(ph)
on
the
following
page
quote
by
quote
is
significant
in
the
sense
that
it
is
a
real
fact
of
life
that
as
a
combination
of
these
circumstances
none
of
which
can
be
neatly
isolated,
that
is
a
combination
of
these
men
and
women
do
not
have
the
same
direct
interest
in
child
rearing,
that
the
illinois
legislature
has
properly
taken
cognizance
of
these
very
real
differences
which
have
never
been
suggested
to
the
other
than
real
differences
in
child
rearing.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
mr.
justice
marshall,
he
would
then
be
classified
as
a
legal
parent
and
entitled
automatically
the
custody
and
control
of
them.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
yes
sir.
he
would
be
--
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
no,
he
did
not
change
one
bit.
he
performed
a
legal
act
that
imposed
on
him
by
law
responsibility
for
the
children
beyond
mere
money
payments
by
the
act
of
marriage.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
he
change
not
at
all
but
by
the
act
the
marrying
the
woman
he
became
liable
under
law
for
more
responsibilities
than
he
had
before.
he
became
liable
for
the
schooling,
for
sending
the
child
to
school.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
that
peter
stanley
be
now
after
marriage
is
legally
responsible
for
his
welfare
and
as
to
the
child,
that
the
child
has
legal
duties
towards
peter
stanley.
he
is
responsible
at
the
time
of
the
legal
relationship
to
support
the
adult
parent
who
cannot
support
himself.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
not
at
all
justice
marshall.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
i
am
--
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
yes,
mr.
justice
and
in
addition
he
is
responsible
too
not
desert
and
tend
for
the
children.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
by
the
adoption
formality
which
is
exactly
comparable
in
this
case
to
the
formality
of
the
marriage
ceremony
he
is
merely
undertaking
the
same
rights
as
a
male
does
by
the
act
of
marriage.
but
more
importantly,
with
a
human
being
who
is
in
existence
when
a
person
gains
the
rights
of
parenthood
over
the
child,
there
is
imposed
by
illinois
law,
legal
responsibility
on
the
child.
to
impose
these
responsibilities
without
consulting
the
interest
of
the
child
either
by
the
desire
of
the
child’s
natural
mother
in
marriage
or
by
the
supervision
of
the
courts
in
an
adoption
proceeding,
to
impose
legal
responsibility
on
a
child
after
he
is
in
existence
to
care
for
an
adult
parent
and
to
do
so,
automatically,
without
consulting
the
interest
of
the
child
is
to
deny
that
child
due
process
of
law.
when
the
child
gains
a
parent,
he
gains
legal
responsibilities.
it
may
or
may
not
be
in
his
best
interest
to
gain
those
legal
responsibilities
toward
his
parent.
that
problem
does
not
exist
between
a
married
couple
where
the
female
gives
birth
to
the
child
because
the
state
imposes
from
the
moment
of
birth
onward
those
reciprocal
rights
and
duties
between
male
and
female,
between
the
children
to
the
parents
and
the
parents
to
the
children.
the
adoption
proceeding
which
the
state
has
required
is
but
a
substitute
for
that
marriage
ceremony,
that
social
contract
with
the
state
where
the
parties
have
agreed
to
accept
those
responsibilities.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
white
but
to
give
the
father
the
children
for
the
asking
of
him
to
make
their
legal
custody
and
control
dependent
only
on
the
will
of
the
father
is
to
make
the
children
chattels
and
to
deny
to
the
children
any
opportunity
and
with
that
in
person
--
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
but
those
--
but
the
unwed
father
while
he
does
have
a
biological
relationship
or
he
may
have
with
the
children
that
is
not
the
determining
factor.
parenthood
is
more
than
biology
and
it
is
more
than
support.
it
encompasses
within
our
society
a
very
wide
range
of
human
activities.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
initially
i
would
observe.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
in
answer
to
your
last
question
mr.
justice
white.
no,
it
would
not
do
him
any
good
to
merely
lay
an
automatic
claim
to
the
children.
the
state
would
require
their
interest
to
be
consulted
before
they
are
handed
over
like
shuttles
chattels
to
the
father.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
and
the
fact
that
the
woman
is
necessarily
present
when
the
child
is
born,
she
is
there
and
identifiable.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
in
fact
the
paternity
is
not
relevant
to
that.
it
is
in
case
and
that
sense
the
concession
is
irrelevant
so
whether
or
not
the
state
has
made
it.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
because
in
that
case
--
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
because
in
the
case
of
the
case
of
the
married
couple,
the
father
will
generally
participate
not
in
the
act
of
birth
but
from
that
time
on
in
caring
with
the
child.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
no
mr.
chief
justice.
most
respectfully
illinois
encourages
him
to
do
so
if
he
will
accept
the
legal
responsibility
for
those
children
by
a
formal
proceeding
comparable
to
the
marriage
ceremony
in
which
he
is
evidencing
through
a
judicial
proceeding
his
desire
to
accept
legal
responsibility
for
the
children.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
no
sir.
i
would
not
agree
to
that
and
the
suggestions
on
the
record
that
would
tend
to
indicate
that
were
not
relevant
to
the
trial
court
below.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
no
sir,
they
were
not
--
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
that
is
correct,
but
it
is
the
petitioner
stanley
who
placed
the
children
with
the
nesses.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
the
nesses,
whether
that
was
done
--
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
no
sir.
the
state
imposed
upon
the
nesses,
the
parties
he
had
physically
deposited
the
children
with
upon
some
person
the
state
imposed
legal
responsibility.
stanley
did
not
ask
for
custody,
he
did
not
ask
for
legal
responsibility.
he
only
objected
to
someone
having
legal
control
over
the
children.
the
question
of
his
prior
relationship,
the
question
of
his
paternity
or
lack
of
it
or
his
misconduct
or
lack
of
it
was
not
part
of
the
trial
below
and
is
not
relevant
to
outcome
of
this
case.
it
is
purely
the
question
of
the
act
of
discrimination.
in
requesting
the
nesses
to
accept
that
legal
responsibility,
the
custodians
he
had
given
the
children
to,
the
state
was
merely
attempting
to
secure
the
welfare
of
the
children
by
providing
a
criminal
penalty
for
anyone
who
would
abandon
a
child.
stanley
was
--
did
not
ask
to
have
them.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
i
would
submit
that
to
be
a
mere
inadvertence
sir.
the
adoption
is
clearly
open
as
an
alternative
to
stanley
in
this
case.
mr.
morton
e.
friedman
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
there
is
no
state
which
imposes
upon
the
unwed
father
the
full
range
of
parental
responsibility
and
there
is
no
state
which
grants
the
unwed
father
outside
of
a
common
law
marriage
state
the
full
range
of
legal
rights
of
parenthood.
