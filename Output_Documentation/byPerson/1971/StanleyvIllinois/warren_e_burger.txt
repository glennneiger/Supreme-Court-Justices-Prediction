chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
number
5014
stanley
against
illinois.
you
may
proceed
mr.
murphy.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
a
finding
here
of
a
valid
common-law
marriage?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
how
--
how
can
you
have
a
common-law
marriage
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
course
we
are
dealing
with
legal
issues
here
so
that
colloquialism
really
is
not
very
relevant,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
there
in
any
occasion
in
that
procedure
that
you
have
just
described
to
determine
paternity
of
the
children?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
there
any
impediment
that
you
can
think
of
that
would
have
prevented
the
petitioner
here
from
carrying
out
an
adoption
of
these
children
or
legal
adoption?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
do
we
find
that
out?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
challenge
the
classification
as
being
unconstitutional
per
se,
i
take
it
under
the
fourteenth
amendment?
the
classification
of
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wed
or
unwed,
but
are
there
not
some
differences
in
a
support
proceeding
for
example
if
they
--
if
a
support
proceeding
were
brought
against
a
father,
in
support
of
his
illegitimate
children
under
the
state
law,
there
would
be
a
greater
burden
with
respect
to
proof
of
his
responsibility
than
there
would
be
of
a
married
father,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
once
you
have
established
that
he
is
the
father,
now
here
he
admitted
it,
so
the
proof
in
this
particular
case
is
not
required,
but
if
he
denied
it
the
state
would
be
--
someone
would
be
put
to
the
burden
of
establishing
i
is
a
fact,
would
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
that
not
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
is
it
not
historically
true
in
the
proceedings
of
this
kind,
for
the
support
of
illegitimate
children
that
someone
must
prove
the
paternity?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
in
paternity
cases
generally,
it
must
be
to
be
established
by
proof
or
admit
it,
is
that
not
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
i
come
back
to
the
question.
is
that
not
a
valid
basis
for
the
classification?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
murphy.
mr.
friedman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
in
the
present
state
of
the
record
we
should
view
this
case
as
one
in
which
there
had
been
a
paternity
proceeding
and
it
had
been
judicially
determined
that
this
man
was
the
father
of
the
child
or
children?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let
me
put
it
in
a
different
way.
if
there
had
been
a
paternity
proceeding
and
there
had
been
a
finding
of
fact,
and
the
conclusion
drawn
was
that
he
was
indeed
the
father,
would
the
case
be
any
different?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
at
the
same
you
concede
that
they
are
handed
over
to
take
your
term
to
the
natural
mother
without
any
inquiry
of
that
kind,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
justify
that
on
the
grounds
of
these
cultural
and
biological
and
historical
practice?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
does
that
not
go
only
to
the
question
of
whether
he
is
in
fact
the
father
which
i
had
understood
you
to
have
conceded?
in
this
proceeding,
this
record
is
filled
with
illusions
to
the
fact
that
everyone
seems
to
concede
this
man
to
be
the
father.
he
insists
upon
it.
he
is
referred
to
as
the
father
only
with
the
adjective
unwed.
so
is
it
not
the
fact
of
paternity
out
of
the
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
why
does
it
not
help
your
case
any
that
the
mother
is
present
at
the
birth
of
necessity?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
can
emphasize
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
this
man
is
trying
to
participate,
but
illinois
will
not
let
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
call
your
attention
to
one,
two
comments
from
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
opinion
which
i
am
not
too
clear
about.
in
referring
here
at
the
end
of
the
opinion
at
page
33
to
the
equal
protection
arguments,
the
court
concludes
by
saying
that
if
that
is
his
claim,
we
need
only
respond
in
this
instance
by
noting
that
the
section
was
not
so
applied
to
him
and
here
is
the
key
part,
in
fact
the
trial
court’s
comments
clearly
indicate
that
court's
willingness
to
consider
a
future
request
by
the
father,
the
court
apparently
then
conceded
that
he
was
the
father,
as
custodian
or
guardian.
now
i
notice
it
does
not
say
or
there
is
no
reference
to
an
adoption
proceeding.
is
there
any
–-
do
you
see
any
significance
in
their
having
omitted
reference
to
adoption
or
was
that
just
inadvertent?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
friedman.
mr.
murphy
you
have
a
few
minutes
left
here,
would
you
care
to
comment
some
time
on
this
language
at
page
33
of
the
supreme
court,
illinois
supreme
court’s
opinion
as
to
what
the
court
had
in
mind?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
we
are
only
concerned
with
what
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
is
said
in
this
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
should
not
--
is
there
not
some
possibility
that
your
client
ought
to
be
exhausting
his
state
remedies
before
he
asks
this
court
to
get
into
this
difficult
--?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
including
adoption?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
us
stay
on
my
question
if
you
will
and
address
your
self
to
that
point.
chief

warren
e.

thank
you,

you
challenge

the
