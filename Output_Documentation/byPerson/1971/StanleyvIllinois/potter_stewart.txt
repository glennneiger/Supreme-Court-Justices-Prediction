justice
potter
stewart
it
was
my
understanding
that
you
have
implicitly
concede
that
the
state
could
make
--
put
some
--
that
the
state
could
put
some
unwed
fathers
in
this
category
of
strangers
to
their
illegitimate
children,
i.e.
fathers
who
were
say
married
and
acting
as
father
in
another
family
or
fathers
who
were
unidentifiable
or
unfindable
but
that
the
state
has
constitutionally
compelled
to
create
a
sub
category
for
the
class
to
which
you
tell
us
your
client
belongs
that
is
a
good
suitable
interested
unwed
father.
is
that
my
understanding?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
the
way
of
putting
your
case?
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand
it
you
claim
that
you
--
that
your
client
belongs
to
an
identifiable
sub-classification
of
unwed
fathers
which
classification
has
a
right
to
constitutional
protection
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
being
not
treated
differently
from
unwed
mothers,
i.e.
that
sub-classification
is
good,
suitable,
interested
unwed
father.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
your
argument,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
of
course
unwed
fathers
such
as
that
i
suppose
have
it
within
their
power
to
correct
the
situation
by
becoming
wed
fathers,
unlike
the
previous
case
where
if
you
are
born
a
woman
you
are
a
woman
and
you
cannot,
i
would
say,
correct
the
situation
as
you
can
alter
the
situation?
justice
potter
stewart
he
could
have
married
the
mother
of
his
children?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
within
his
power
to
become
aware
about
it?
justice
potter
stewart
before
we
–
while
you
are
still
interrupted,
perhaps
a
word.
who
is
this
other
child
who
keeps
--
whose
names
keeps
getting
mentioned,
mentioned
throughout
the
brief
here,
karen
is
her
name?
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
his
legitimate
child
by
a
previous
marriage?
justice
potter
stewart
by
the
same
marriage.
and
he
was
the
target
of
neglect?
justice
potter
stewart
with
respect
to
that
daughter?
justice
potter
stewart
did
that
have
anything
to
do
with
the
decision
in
this
in
case?
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean,
that
may
not
be
relevant
but
karen’s
name
keeps
being
mentioned
(voice
overlap)
throughout
the
brief
and
i
wanted
to
--?
justice
potter
stewart
you
have
--
i
am
not
sure
on
if
i
understand
you
when
you
talk
to,
rely
upon
which
you
call
our
culture,
rely
upon
history
and
upon
physical
differences
but
that
i
understand
and
i
understand
the
interest
in
adoption
and
the
interest
of
legitimizing
the
children.
i
do
not
quite
understand
what
you
mean
by
the
relying
on
what
you
call
our
culture?
justice
potter
stewart
so
our
culture
as
you
put
is
really
--
that
is
not
an
additional
--
that
is
not
an
additional
support
for
the
state
classification
that
is
additional
to
history
or
the
physical?
justice
potter
stewart
distinguishing
characteristics?
justice
potter
stewart
product
of
those?
justice
potter
stewart
or
have
they
change
his
status
it
certainly
among
other
things
made
him
ineligible
to
legally
marry
anybody
else,
has
not
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
once
you
marry,
at
least
again
in
our
culture
and
under
our
laws,
if
a
man
marries
a
woman
it
changes
his
status
at
least
to
the
extent
that
he
his
legally
ineligible
to
marry
anybody
else
until
he
divorces
that
wife
or
she
died?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
question
of
that
--
at
least
now
that
the
law
has
been
clarified
in
illinois,
it
is
clear,
is
it
not,
that
he
is
an
eligible
applicant.
he
therefore
asked
for
custody
of
the
children
or
as
an
adopted
parent?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
not
a
constitutional
claim
at
all,
is
it?
your
claim
is
that
the
state
by
making
just
the
equivalent
of
john
joan
denies
him
equal
protection
law?
justice
potter
stewart
he
just
be
the
child's
mother?
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
have
been
apparently
eligible
suitor
in
history,
would
he
not?[laughter]
justice

it
