mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
for
18
years,
peter
stanley
lived
with
his
common-law-wife.
from
the
time
his
two
minor
children
peter
stanley,
jr.
and
kimberly
stanley
were
born,
he
lived
with
and
supported
and
build-up
a
familial
relationship
with
these
children.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
common-law-marriage
was
outlawed
in
illinois
i
believe
at
the
turn
of
the
century
in
1905.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
i
am
using
it
in
the
generic
sense
of
the
word.
he
lived
with
a
woman
for
18
years
whom
he
called
his
wife.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
i
assume
not,
your
honor.
joan
stanley
died
and
sometime
thereafter
peter
stanley
asked
his
long
time
and
trusted
friend,
the
nesses
to
care
for
his
children.
two
months
thereafter
a
dependency
petition
was
filed
in
juvenile
court
of
cook
county
and
there
was
a
finding
of
dependency.
it
is
much
as
--
and
the
children
were
made
wards
of
the
juvenile
court
of
cook
county.
in
as
much
as
a
finding
of
wardship
as
a
final
order,
his
only
way
to
get
around
this
order
was
to
appeal
which
he
did
do.
now
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
--
is
simply
whether
it
is
a
denial
of
equal
protection
for
the
state
of
illinois
not
to
recognize
peter
stanley
for
what
he
was,
that
is
the
father
of
this
two
minor
children
and
the
non-neglectful
father
of
this
two
minor
children
and
whether
it
was
a
denial
of
equal
protection
for
the
state
of
illinois
who
treated
peter
stanley
as
something
less
than
a
stranger
that
is
giving
no
right
to
custody
control
or
even
visitation
with
his
two
minor
children.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
no,
it
was
assumed
by
the
state’s
attorney
and
by
the
trial
court
and
by
all
parties
that
he
was
the
father.
in
fact,
the
assistant
state’s
attorney
did
state
that
there
was
no
--
that
they
were
contending
that
peter
stanley
was
not
the
father
of
the
two
children,
that
never
became
an
issue.
of
course
for
equal
protection
analysis
a
classification
must
be
reasonable
and
not
arbitrary
and
rest
upon
some
ground
of
difference
having
a
fair
in
substantial
relation
to
the
object
of
the
legislature.
so
that
all
persons
similarly
situated
shall
be
treated
a
like.
further
of
course,
certain
interests
that
are
disadvantaged
require
a
more
strict
scrutiny
by
this
court.
now
it
is
difficult
for
us
to
argue
as
to
just
what
the
state
purpose
is
behind
the
statute,
behind
this
discriminatory
classification
are.
the
state
and
the
illinois
supreme
court
argued
one
purpose
in
its
brief
in
opposition
filed
in
this
court
argue
the
second
purpose
and
its
brief
in
this
court
seem
to
argue
yet
another
purpose
to
make
the
statutory
scheme
stand
the
scrutiny
of
this
court.
however,
there
seems
to
be
a
threat
running
through
it
and
that
is
that
somehow
it
is
in
the
best
interest
of
minor
children
that
their
fathers
who
have
built
up
familiar
relationships,
but
who
have
never
married
their
mothers
be
treated
as
strangers
to
the
children.
however,
an
analysis
of
illinois
law
and
of
the
historical
background
in
illinois
law
will
demonstrate,
we
believe
that
the
purpose
behind
the
discriminatory
scheme
in
illinois
was
simply
for
the
better
administration
of
the
illinois
adoption
act.
now,
the
state
alleges
that
the
welfare
of
children
in
illinois
is
promoted
by
the
making
of
the
illegitimate
father
a
stranger
to
his
child
by
faired
out
good
and
bad
unwed
fathers.
we
believe
that
an
examination
of
this
will
show
that
this
was
not
the
purpose
of
the
general
assembly
and
secondly
even
assuming
it
were
that
there
simply
is
no
rational
relationship
between
this
alleged
purpose
and
the
classification.
first
of
all
it
does
not
faired
out
good
and
bad
unwed
fathers.
it
merely
grants
to
the
uninterested
in
abandoning
and
perhaps
neglectful
unwed
father
his
wish
of
not
being
a
father
to
the
children
and
allowing
him
to
do
what
he
wishes
to.
it
places
the
burden
upon
the
unwed
father
like
peter
stanley
to
come
in
and
show
by
a
greater
burden
of
proof
than
a
neglectful
parent
has
to
that
he
wants
his
children.
but
the
state
simply
does,
it
takes
the
children
away
from
the
parent,
places
them
in
either
an
orphanage
or
a
foster
home
and
then
tells
the
father,
if
you
want
them
back
you
must
go
back
to
adoption
court
and
show
not
that
you
are
non-neglectful
and
not
that
you
are
something
less
than
indigent,
but
that
you
are
not
indigent
and
that
you
are
very
suitable
parent.
now
--
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
if
peter
stanley
could
have
adopted
his
children,
we
would
not
be
here
today.
peter
stanley
was
in
the
same
position
as
any
wed
father
would
have
been
whose
wife
had
just
died
and
who
was
also
indigent.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
he
left
his
children
with
his
long
time
and
trusted
friend,
the
nesses
and
he
said,
“would
you
take
care
of
them?”
it
is
in
the
record,
same
thing
that
a
wed
father
might
have
done.
so
obviously,
stanley
was
in
no
position
to
care
for
his
children.
furthermore
the
probation
officer
states
that
peter
stanley
was
indigent,
so
he
has
--
he
is
indigent.
he
is
in
a
position
not
to
care
for
his
children
at
that
time,
of
course
he
could
not
adopt.
there
is
no
court
in
the
world
that
would
have
allowed
stanley
to
adopt
his
children
plus
having
the
opprobrium
of
being
an
unwed
father
and
all
through
its
brief
the
state
says
unwed
fathers
are
bad
people
or
historically
we
know
they
are
abandoning
people
and
then
they
come
across
and
say,
well
all
stanley
has
to
do
his
run
down
to
the
adoption
court
to
adopt.
the
same
opprobrium
which
the
state
attaches
to
stanley
in
its
brief
the
adoption
court
is
going
to
attach
that
stanley
also.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
no,
he
has
not.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
at
the
time,
that
this
proceeding
arose
it
was
theoretically
impossible
for
stanley
to
apply
for
custody.
section
62
of
the
paternity
act
in
illinois
states
that
no
parent
has
the
right
to
custody
--
no
unwed
father
has
the
right
to
custody
or
control
--
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
no,
the
state
and
we
have
assumed
for
argument
here
that
they
would
allow
peter
stanley
to
have
custody.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
no
and
for
this
reason
that
after
the
stanley
decision
came
down
from
the
illinois
supreme
court,
the
illinois
appellate
court
in
the
case
of
the
vandolin
v.
vandolin
(ph)
upheld
the
former
illinois
supreme
and
appellate
court
decisions
in
denying
the
putative
father
even
the
right
to
visit
his
children.
and
in
fact
pursuant
to
that
decision,
the
attorney
general’s
office
moved
in
the
juvenile
court
to
terminate
all
visitations
between
stanley
and
his
children
and
the
juvenile
court
in
fact
did
terminate
such
visitation.
it
was
only
after
this
court
granted
certiorari
that
they
even
allowed
stanley
to
start
visiting
his
children
again.
so
as
a
theoretical
–-
it
was
theoretically
impossible,
even
practically
it
was
out
of
the
question.
stanley
still
indigent
and
still
not
married.
i
point
out
that
the
state’s
attorney
in
the
court
below
when
he
suggested
ways
in
which
stanley
might
regain
some
type
of
custody
over
his
children,
suggested
that
stanley
marry
in
order
and
establish
an
orderly
family
situation
that
at
times
can
be
rather
difficult
thing
for
any
male.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
equal
protection,
your
honor.
we
are
not
talking
about
custody
even
if
stanley
--
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
well,
these
lines
are
so
arbitrarily
drawn
here.
stanley
is
over
--
there
is
over
classification
from
one
point
of
view.
we
are
putting
stanley
and
similar
petitioners
into
a
classification
of
all
unwed
fathers.
we
are
just
making
the
presumption
that
all
unwed
fathers
are
bad
people,
the
same
way
we
--
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
as
against
not
only
unwed
mothers,
but
as
against
wed
but
widowed
fathers
for
instance
or
wed
and
neglectful
fathers
or
wed
and
neglectful
mothers
or
unwed
neglectful
mothers,
we
do
not
make
these
presumptions.
it
is
like
saying
that
all
japanese
are
security
risk.
we
are
saying
all
unwed
fathers
are
bad
people
and
they
must
go
through
this
long
arguist
degrading
and
expensive
process
to
establish
some
rights.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
no
sir
and
under
section
53
if
i
understand
your
question
mr.
chief
justice,
under
section
53
of
the
paternity
act,
the
unwed
father
has
the
responsibility
of
maintenance,
board,
education
and
welfare.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
well
i
--
our
argument
is
--
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
the
state
would
have
to
prove
that
he
were
the
father
that
is
correct.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
in
the
case
of
abandoning
fathers
that
is
correct.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
that
is
true.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
no,
your
honor
because
again
we
are
making
the
assumption
that
all
unwed
fathers
are
the
type
of
people
we
have
to
drag
in
the
court
by
their
neck
and
say
pay,
but
that
is
simply
untrue.
there
are
thousands,
obviously
of
unwed
fathers
who
simply
cannot
marry
the
mothers
for
many,
many
reasons.
one
of
which
the
state
admits
is
that
there
are
many
people
who
are
too
poor
to
get
a
divorce
and
simply
take
up
living
with
someone
else
and
build
the
familial
relationship
with
their
wife.
these
people
do
not
have
to
be
dragged
in
court,
but
yet
they
are
familial
fathers
and
why
should
we
classify
these
familial
fathers
and
put
them
in
the
broad
classification
of
bad
fellows
and
that
is
what
the
state
of
illinois
has
done.
that
is
why
we
are
saying
these
lines
are
so
broadly
drawn.
the
state
of
illinois
simply
could
have
said
unwed
fathers
who
abandon
their
children
or
who
are
unknown
or
who
do
not
show
up
within
two
months
will
be
considered
strangers
to
their
children.
and
they
would
have
accomplished
what
they
wish
to
accomplish.
that
simply
would
be
the
–-
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
the
father
and
mother
have
never
married.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
it
can
be
--
they
can
prove
neglect.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
that
is
right.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
indigency
is
not
enough.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
indigency
is
never
a
requirement
to
find
neglect,
to
prove
neglect
and
you
must
prove
it
beyond
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
and
all
your
rights
are
not
cut
off.
you
have
the
right
to
visitation
and
right
to
name
his
religious
affiliation
and
the
right
to
(voice
overlap)
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
he
is
not
a
parent.
he
is
a
stranger.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
he
cannot.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
even
if
he
could,
it
does
not
change
the
posture
of
this
case.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
that
is
correct.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
that
is
correct.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
oh
certainly!
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
that
is
correct.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
that
is
correct.
and
while
the
mother
is
alive
the
state
will
not
interfere
with
the
familial
relationship
of
the
father
either
except
through
a
neglect
proceeding.
i
would
--
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
it
is
true.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
that
is
the
narrow
equal
protection
argument.
we
think
it
is
broader
than
that.
we
think
the
lines
are
just
so
arbitrarily
drawn
in
other
words
why
treat
stanley
any
different
then
you
would
a
wed
father
in
similar
circumstances.
we
agree
that
is
the
primary
equal
protection
argument.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
no,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
that
is
correct.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
entirely
different
case.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
well,
of
course
they
are
not
different
at
all.
as
i
pointed
out
previously,
paternity
act
is
the
father,
unwed
fathers
have
the
obligation
of
support,
maintenance,
welfare
and
education.
and
what
other
responsibilities
that
any
parent
had
except
the
law
and
we
cannot
legislate
that.
secondly,
the
state
really
misstates
these
statutes.
they
do
not
say
that
no
parent,
and
your
honors
can
read
the
statutes,
they
do
not
say,
no
parent,
only
a
parent
has
responsibility
as
the
state
lays
out.
they
talk
about
one
who
has
cut
--
most
of
the
statutes
say
one
who
has
custody
and
control
for
any
father,
mother
or
person
who
has
custody
and
control
and
i
think
here,
and
i
would
further
point
out
that
the
paternity
act
and
the
juvenile
court
act
are
the
only
two
acts
in
state
of
illinois
in
general
assembly
as
attempted
to
define
the
word
parent
as
excluding
the
unwed
father.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
it
would
not
change
the
posture
of
this
case.
if
the
father
had
build-up
a
familial
relationship
with
his
children
and
there
was
a
biological
relationship
as
well,
we
believe
that
it
would
not
change
the
posture.
i
would
further
add
to
an
early
question
that
mr.
chief
justice
asked
me
as
to
why
could
have
stanley
not
adopted.
let
us
assume
that
stanley
put
in
for
adoption
and
if
it
were
denied
because
he
was
indigent
or
still
not
in
any
situation
to
adopt
his
children,
he
then
would
be
forever
in
all
probability
restricted
from
adopting
his
children.
they
could
be
placed
up
for
adoption
if
someone
else
could
adopt
them
without
notice
to
stanley
and
that
as
a
very
practical
matter
why
he
did
not
asked
them.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
if
--
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
if
for
the
better
administration
of
the
adoption
act,
the
state
feels
that
it
cannot
notify
abandoning
unwed
fathers
and
if
they
are
unknown
then
we
might
concede
it
is
not
the
case
here.
we
have
considered
that
if
we
might
--
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
that
is
correct.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
that
is
correct
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
unwed
fathers,
in
the
situation
of
mr.
stanley,
have
an
opportunity
to
correct
the
situation
by
that.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
well,
the
problem
does
not
arise
while
the
mother
is
alive.
it
only
arises
when
the
mother
dies
and
at
that
time
it
becomes
biologically
impossible
perhaps
theologically
possible
to
marry
her.
as
long
as
the
mother
is
alive
state
--
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
it
was
in
his
power
but
the
problem
did
not
arise
and
(voice
overlap)
the
state
did
not
interfere
and
cannot
interfere
under
the
relationship
of
that.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
i
tend
to
believe
that
if
stanley
did
not
place
the
children
with
the
nesses
it
would
come
out
differently.
i
do
not
know.
i
do
not
think
it
is
difficult
to
say.
once
charges
were
brought,
the
court
had
to
make
the
only
finding
it
could
have.
there
is
no
defense
--
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
no.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
there
would
--
the
probation
officer
was
talking
about
perhaps
we
give
him
custody
if
he
--
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
right
and
i
think
all
these
people
really
--
i
was
not
at
the
trial.
but
i
think
all
these
people
merely
trying
to
placate
stanley
who
assumedly
was
very
upset
to
find
it.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
yes,
there
was
an
older
daughter
who
was
17,
there
was
a
neglect
petition
filed
against
stanley
and
it
was
proven
against
him.
i
was
the
prosecuting
attorney
in
that
case.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
yes,
no
by
the
same
the
marriage.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
that
is
correct.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
that
is
correct.
=
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
i
believe
that
it
may
have
been
something
to
do
with
charge
being
brought.
it
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
decision.
from
the
court’s
point
of
view
and
the
from
the
state’s
attorney’s
point,
it
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
decision.
in
the
probation
officer’s
point
of
view
i
do
not
know.
but
i
--
and
i
am
speaking
outside
the
record
now
from
knowing
the
court
and
the
state’s
attorney
personally
in
the
matters
obviously
which
are
not
relevant.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
i
was
not
the
prosecuting
attorney.
i
was
the
attorney
who
prosecuted
the
case.
there
is
a
slight
difference.
the
state’s
response
--
well
we
have
covered
most
of
the
points
already.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
adoption
that
it
is
our
point
of
view
--
that
it
is
what
we
believe
that
the
statutory
scheme
is
what
is
it
is
because
general
assembly
wished
to
make
plans
for
the
better
administration
of
the
adoption
statute.
between
the
years
1827
and
1949
in
illinois,
unwed
fathers
had
the
right
to
custody
of
their
children
merely
for
the
asking.
between
1827
and
1872,
all
they
had
to
do
is
demand
from
the
unwed
mother
the
child
and
she
had
to
deliver
them
up
or
the
father
could
stop
support
payments.
between
1872
and
1949,
it
was
after
the
child’s
tenth
birthday.
in
1946,
the
illinois
attorney
general
issued
an
opinion
which
held
that
was
stated
that
adoption
agencies
would
after
that
point
have
to
notify
any
unwed
father
of
adoption
proceedings.
and
if
in
fact,
the
unwed
father
were
unknown
then
the
guardian
would
have
to
be
appointed
for
this
purpose.
in
1949,
the
first
convenient
general
assembly
thereafter
the
illinois
state
legislature
amended
the
act
to
state
which
the
predecessor
of
today’s
paternity
act
that
no
unwed
father
would
have
any
right
to
custody
or
control
over
his
children
and
in
illinois
law
review
article
that
we
cite
here
point
out
that
this
was
merely
to
amend
the
paternity
act
to
keep
it
in
line
with
the
adoption
act.
the
juvenile
court
act
was
passed
in
1965.
there
is
no
historical
background
on
why
unwed
fathers
are
excluded
from
the
definition
of
parents
except
the
obvious
one
of
making
this
in
line
with
the
paternity
and
adoption
acts
in
the
state
of
illinois.
and
it
seems
quite
obvious
that
better
administration
of
the
adoption
act
is
not
a
compelling
reason.
in
fact,
it
is
not
rationally
related
at
all
to
the
classification
here
and
as
a
practical
matter,
it
does
not
succeed
in
what
it
wants
to
do
because
again
it
merely
allows
the
uninterested,
abandoning
and
unknown
unwed
fathers
not
to
come
into
court
while
it
forces
the
suitable
and
caring
for
unwed
fathers
to
come
to
court
to
demand
some
type
custody.
and
if
in
fact,
the
adoption
act
actually
did
force
these
unwed
fathers
to
come
before
it,
it
would
merely
clog
the
adoption
courts
with
unwed,
but
suitable
fathers
seeking
to
adopt
their
own
children.
i
think
what
happened
here,
we
believe
what
happened
here
is
that
the
general
assembly
never
considered
this
subclass
of
the
fathers
and
simply
made
a
law
to
make
the
juvenile
court
act
fit
in
with
the
adoption
act
never
considering
unwed
but
familial
fathers
and
of
course
this
type
of
father
like
japanese,
chinese
and
black
people
and
indigent
criminal
appellants
did
not
have
at
that
time
much
of
a
lobby
in
the
state
legislature.
so
for
the
reasons
which
we
have
stated
in
the
brief,
for
the
reasons
we
have
argued,
we
would
ask
that
this
court
reverse
the
opinion
of
the
illinois
supreme
court.
thank
you.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
i
would
find
difficulty,
your
honor.
the
court
there
did
suggest
the
right
of
custody
but
in
later
case
they
again
agreed
that
unwed
fathers
had
no
right
to
custody.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
the
adopt
--
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
i
would
assume
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
realized
that
he
may
have
had
the
theoretical
possibility
to
adopt
the
children
as
he
did
at
that
time.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
i
think
the
law
is
clear
that
he
has
a
theoretical
possibility
to
adopt.
i
believe
the
law
is
unclear
as
to
whether
he
has
a
right
to
custody.
you
see
vandollin
came
down
after
stanley
at
least
and
vandollin
said
no
right
of
custody.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
we
did
exhaust
our
state
remedy.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
we
did
exhaust
our
state
remedy.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
(inaudible)
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
yes
that
is
correct,
their
claim
is
that
--
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
fine.
first
of
course,
there
is
the
point
that
why
put
the
burden
on
him
to
go
the
adoption
when
we
do
not
do
it
to
anyone
else
and
that
is
our
claim
and
that
is
the
claim
the
illinois
supreme
court
answered
negatively
to
us.
secondly,
once
there
is
a
finding
of
wardship
we
have
to
appeal
within
30
days
which
we
did.
stanley
at
that
time
obviously
from
his
placement
with
his
children
with
the
nesses
a
practical
matter
could
not
adopt.
in
fact,
if
he
could
have
adopted
and
were
not
indigent,
we
would
not
be
before
this
court
today
as
a
practical
matter.
i
would
like
to
address
very
briefly
a
point
that
the
state
raised
and
that
is
that
he
could
have
married
joan
stanley
while
she
was
living
and
if
we
assume
this
we
are
assuming
that
all
women
are
weak
frivolous
creatures
that
any
man
has
to
say
please
marry
me
and
she
will.
there
is
no
evidence
there
was
not
joan
stanley
would
not
marry
peter
stanley
and
we
can
assume
that
in
many
cases
it
is
the
woman
who
will
not
marry
the
man
and
not
the
man
who
refuses
to
marry
the
woman.
so
what
happens
in
the
case
of
a
man
who
lives
for
18
years
with
the
woman
who
has
two
children
by
him
and
she
refuses
to
marry
him
and
then
she
dies.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
they
term
a
bachelor.
i
do
not
know,
but
they
tell
me,
the
longer
you
lived
with
person,
might
be
less
eligible.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
your
honor,
as
i
say
i
do
not
--
why
what
makes
a
woman
do
what
she
does
is
beyond
my
comprehension
very
well.
and
i
simply
do
not
know
why
a
woman
why
not
marry
a
man
certainly
i
think
just
about
any
woman
who
want
to
marry.[laughter]
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
but
the
--
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
well,
the
difference
is
there,
so
different
in
here.
there
it
was
merely
a
father’s
interest
in
gaining
the
estate
of
his
son.
here,
it
is
the
interest
of
a
father
who
has
built
a
familial
relationship
in
maintaining
that
relationship
with
his
children.
it
is
more
than
money
that
is
concerned
here.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
excuse
me,
it
was
the
other
way
around,
it
was
the
son.
but
again
it
was
matter
of
money
and
here
it
is
a
matter
of
familial
relationship.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
for
18
years,
peter
stanley
lived
with
his
common-law-wife.
from
the
time
his
two
minor
children
peter
stanley,
jr.
and
kimberly
stanley
were
born,
he
lived
with
and
supported
and
build-up
a
familial
relationship
with
these
children.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
common-law-marriage
was
outlawed
in
illinois
i
believe
at
the
turn
of
the
century
in
1905.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
i
am
using
it
in
the
generic
sense
of
the
word.
he
lived
with
a
woman
for
18
years
whom
he
called
his
wife.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
i
assume
not,
your
honor.
joan
stanley
died
and
sometime
thereafter
peter
stanley
asked
his
long
time
and
trusted
friend,
the
nesses
to
care
for
his
children.
two
months
thereafter
a
dependency
petition
was
filed
in
juvenile
court
of
cook
county
and
there
was
a
finding
of
dependency.
it
is
much
as
--
and
the
children
were
made
wards
of
the
juvenile
court
of
cook
county.
in
as
much
as
a
finding
of
wardship
as
a
final
order,
his
only
way
to
get
around
this
order
was
to
appeal
which
he
did
do.
now
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
--
is
simply
whether
it
is
a
denial
of
equal
protection
for
the
state
of
illinois
not
to
recognize
peter
stanley
for
what
he
was,
that
is
the
father
of
this
two
minor
children
and
the
non-neglectful
father
of
this
two
minor
children
and
whether
it
was
a
denial
of
equal
protection
for
the
state
of
illinois
who
treated
peter
stanley
as
something
less
than
a
stranger
that
is
giving
no
right
to
custody
control
or
even
visitation
with
his
two
minor
children.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
no,
it
was
assumed
by
the
state’s
attorney
and
by
the
trial
court
and
by
all
parties
that
he
was
the
father.
in
fact,
the
assistant
state’s
attorney
did
state
that
there
was
no
--
that
they
were
contending
that
peter
stanley
was
not
the
father
of
the
two
children,
that
never
became
an
issue.
of
course
for
equal
protection
analysis
a
classification
must
be
reasonable
and
not
arbitrary
and
rest
upon
some
ground
of
difference
having
a
fair
in
substantial
relation
to
the
object
of
the
legislature.
so
that
all
persons
similarly
situated
shall
be
treated
a
like.
further
of
course,
certain
interests
that
are
disadvantaged
require
a
more
strict
scrutiny
by
this
court.
now
it
is
difficult
for
us
to
argue
as
to
just
what
the
state
purpose
is
behind
the
statute,
behind
this
discriminatory
classification
are.
the
state
and
the
illinois
supreme
court
argued
one
purpose
in
its
brief
in
opposition
filed
in
this
court
argue
the
second
purpose
and
its
brief
in
this
court
seem
to
argue
yet
another
purpose
to
make
the
statutory
scheme
stand
the
scrutiny
of
this
court.
however,
there
seems
to
be
a
threat
running
through
it
and
that
is
that
somehow
it
is
in
the
best
interest
of
minor
children
that
their
fathers
who
have
built
up
familiar
relationships,
but
who
have
never
married
their
mothers
be
treated
as
strangers
to
the
children.
however,
an
analysis
of
illinois
law
and
of
the
historical
background
in
illinois
law
will
demonstrate,
we
believe
that
the
purpose
behind
the
discriminatory
scheme
in
illinois
was
simply
for
the
better
administration
of
the
illinois
adoption
act.
now,
the
state
alleges
that
the
welfare
of
children
in
illinois
is
promoted
by
the
making
of
the
illegitimate
father
a
stranger
to
his
child
by
faired
out
good
and
bad
unwed
fathers.
we
believe
that
an
examination
of
this
will
show
that
this
was
not
the
purpose
of
the
general
assembly
and
secondly
even
assuming
it
were
that
there
simply
is
no
rational
relationship
between
this
alleged
purpose
and
the
classification.
first
of
all
it
does
not
faired
out
good
and
bad
unwed
fathers.
it
merely
grants
to
the
uninterested
in
abandoning
and
perhaps
neglectful
unwed
father
his
wish
of
not
being
a
father
to
the
children
and
allowing
him
to
do
what
he
wishes
to.
it
places
the
burden
upon
the
unwed
father
like
peter
stanley
to
come
in
and
show
by
a
greater
burden
of
proof
than
a
neglectful
parent
has
to
that
he
wants
his
children.
but
the
state
simply
does,
it
takes
the
children
away
from
the
parent,
places
them
in
either
an
orphanage
or
a
foster
home
and
then
tells
the
father,
if
you
want
them
back
you
must
go
back
to
adoption
court
and
show
not
that
you
are
non-neglectful
and
not
that
you
are
something
less
than
indigent,
but
that
you
are
not
indigent
and
that
you
are
very
suitable
parent.
now
--
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
if
peter
stanley
could
have
adopted
his
children,
we
would
not
be
here
today.
peter
stanley
was
in
the
same
position
as
any
wed
father
would
have
been
whose
wife
had
just
died
and
who
was
also
indigent.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
he
left
his
children
with
his
long
time
and
trusted
friend,
the
nesses
and
he
said,
“would
you
take
care
of
them?”
it
is
in
the
record,
same
thing
that
a
wed
father
might
have
done.
so
obviously,
stanley
was
in
no
position
to
care
for
his
children.
furthermore
the
probation
officer
states
that
peter
stanley
was
indigent,
so
he
has
--
he
is
indigent.
he
is
in
a
position
not
to
care
for
his
children
at
that
time,
of
course
he
could
not
adopt.
there
is
no
court
in
the
world
that
would
have
allowed
stanley
to
adopt
his
children
plus
having
the
opprobrium
of
being
an
unwed
father
and
all
through
its
brief
the
state
says
unwed
fathers
are
bad
people
or
historically
we
know
they
are
abandoning
people
and
then
they
come
across
and
say,
well
all
stanley
has
to
do
his
run
down
to
the
adoption
court
to
adopt.
the
same
opprobrium
which
the
state
attaches
to
stanley
in
its
brief
the
adoption
court
is
going
to
attach
that
stanley
also.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
no,
he
has
not.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
at
the
time,
that
this
proceeding
arose
it
was
theoretically
impossible
for
stanley
to
apply
for
custody.
section
62
of
the
paternity
act
in
illinois
states
that
no
parent
has
the
right
to
custody
--
no
unwed
father
has
the
right
to
custody
or
control
--
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
no,
the
state
and
we
have
assumed
for
argument
here
that
they
would
allow
peter
stanley
to
have
custody.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
no
and
for
this
reason
that
after
the
stanley
decision
came
down
from
the
illinois
supreme
court,
the
illinois
appellate
court
in
the
case
of
the
vandolin
v.
vandolin
(ph)
upheld
the
former
illinois
supreme
and
appellate
court
decisions
in
denying
the
putative
father
even
the
right
to
visit
his
children.
and
in
fact
pursuant
to
that
decision,
the
attorney
general’s
office
moved
in
the
juvenile
court
to
terminate
all
visitations
between
stanley
and
his
children
and
the
juvenile
court
in
fact
did
terminate
such
visitation.
it
was
only
after
this
court
granted
certiorari
that
they
even
allowed
stanley
to
start
visiting
his
children
again.
so
as
a
theoretical
–-
it
was
theoretically
impossible,
even
practically
it
was
out
of
the
question.
stanley
still
indigent
and
still
not
married.
i
point
out
that
the
state’s
attorney
in
the
court
below
when
he
suggested
ways
in
which
stanley
might
regain
some
type
of
custody
over
his
children,
suggested
that
stanley
marry
in
order
and
establish
an
orderly
family
situation
that
at
times
can
be
rather
difficult
thing
for
any
male.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
equal
protection,
your
honor.
we
are
not
talking
about
custody
even
if
stanley
--
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
well,
these
lines
are
so
arbitrarily
drawn
here.
stanley
is
over
--
there
is
over
classification
from
one
point
of
view.
we
are
putting
stanley
and
similar
petitioners
into
a
classification
of
all
unwed
fathers.
we
are
just
making
the
presumption
that
all
unwed
fathers
are
bad
people,
the
same
way
we
--
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
as
against
not
only
unwed
mothers,
but
as
against
wed
but
widowed
fathers
for
instance
or
wed
and
neglectful
fathers
or
wed
and
neglectful
mothers
or
unwed
neglectful
mothers,
we
do
not
make
these
presumptions.
it
is
like
saying
that
all
japanese
are
security
risk.
we
are
saying
all
unwed
fathers
are
bad
people
and
they
must
go
through
this
long
arguist
degrading
and
expensive
process
to
establish
some
rights.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
no
sir
and
under
section
53
if
i
understand
your
question
mr.
chief
justice,
under
section
53
of
the
paternity
act,
the
unwed
father
has
the
responsibility
of
maintenance,
board,
education
and
welfare.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
well
i
--
our
argument
is
--
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
the
state
would
have
to
prove
that
he
were
the
father
that
is
correct.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
in
the
case
of
abandoning
fathers
that
is
correct.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
that
is
true.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
no,
your
honor
because
again
we
are
making
the
assumption
that
all
unwed
fathers
are
the
type
of
people
we
have
to
drag
in
the
court
by
their
neck
and
say
pay,
but
that
is
simply
untrue.
there
are
thousands,
obviously
of
unwed
fathers
who
simply
cannot
marry
the
mothers
for
many,
many
reasons.
one
of
which
the
state
admits
is
that
there
are
many
people
who
are
too
poor
to
get
a
divorce
and
simply
take
up
living
with
someone
else
and
build
the
familial
relationship
with
their
wife.
these
people
do
not
have
to
be
dragged
in
court,
but
yet
they
are
familial
fathers
and
why
should
we
classify
these
familial
fathers
and
put
them
in
the
broad
classification
of
bad
fellows
and
that
is
what
the
state
of
illinois
has
done.
that
is
why
we
are
saying
these
lines
are
so
broadly
drawn.
the
state
of
illinois
simply
could
have
said
unwed
fathers
who
abandon
their
children
or
who
are
unknown
or
who
do
not
show
up
within
two
months
will
be
considered
strangers
to
their
children.
and
they
would
have
accomplished
what
they
wish
to
accomplish.
that
simply
would
be
the
–-
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
the
father
and
mother
have
never
married.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
it
can
be
--
they
can
prove
neglect.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
that
is
right.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
indigency
is
not
enough.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
indigency
is
never
a
requirement
to
find
neglect,
to
prove
neglect
and
you
must
prove
it
beyond
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
and
all
your
rights
are
not
cut
off.
you
have
the
right
to
visitation
and
right
to
name
his
religious
affiliation
and
the
right
to
(voice
overlap)
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
he
is
not
a
parent.
he
is
a
stranger.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
he
cannot.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
even
if
he
could,
it
does
not
change
the
posture
of
this
case.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
that
is
correct.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
that
is
correct.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
oh
certainly!
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
that
is
correct.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
that
is
correct.
and
while
the
mother
is
alive
the
state
will
not
interfere
with
the
familial
relationship
of
the
father
either
except
through
a
neglect
proceeding.
i
would
--
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
it
is
true.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
that
is
the
narrow
equal
protection
argument.
we
think
it
is
broader
than
that.
we
think
the
lines
are
just
so
arbitrarily
drawn
in
other
words
why
treat
stanley
any
different
then
you
would
a
wed
father
in
similar
circumstances.
we
agree
that
is
the
primary
equal
protection
argument.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
no,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
that
is
correct.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
entirely
different
case.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
well,
of
course
they
are
not
different
at
all.
as
i
pointed
out
previously,
paternity
act
is
the
father,
unwed
fathers
have
the
obligation
of
support,
maintenance,
welfare
and
education.
and
what
other
responsibilities
that
any
parent
had
except
the
law
and
we
cannot
legislate
that.
secondly,
the
state
really
misstates
these
statutes.
they
do
not
say
that
no
parent,
and
your
honors
can
read
the
statutes,
they
do
not
say,
no
parent,
only
a
parent
has
responsibility
as
the
state
lays
out.
they
talk
about
one
who
has
cut
--
most
of
the
statutes
say
one
who
has
custody
and
control
for
any
father,
mother
or
person
who
has
custody
and
control
and
i
think
here,
and
i
would
further
point
out
that
the
paternity
act
and
the
juvenile
court
act
are
the
only
two
acts
in
state
of
illinois
in
general
assembly
as
attempted
to
define
the
word
parent
as
excluding
the
unwed
father.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
it
would
not
change
the
posture
of
this
case.
if
the
father
had
build-up
a
familial
relationship
with
his
children
and
there
was
a
biological
relationship
as
well,
we
believe
that
it
would
not
change
the
posture.
i
would
further
add
to
an
early
question
that
mr.
chief
justice
asked
me
as
to
why
could
have
stanley
not
adopted.
let
us
assume
that
stanley
put
in
for
adoption
and
if
it
were
denied
because
he
was
indigent
or
still
not
in
any
situation
to
adopt
his
children,
he
then
would
be
forever
in
all
probability
restricted
from
adopting
his
children.
they
could
be
placed
up
for
adoption
if
someone
else
could
adopt
them
without
notice
to
stanley
and
that
as
a
very
practical
matter
why
he
did
not
asked
them.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
if
--
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
if
for
the
better
administration
of
the
adoption
act,
the
state
feels
that
it
cannot
notify
abandoning
unwed
fathers
and
if
they
are
unknown
then
we
might
concede
it
is
not
the
case
here.
we
have
considered
that
if
we
might
--
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
that
is
correct.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
that
is
correct
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
unwed
fathers,
in
the
situation
of
mr.
stanley,
have
an
opportunity
to
correct
the
situation
by
that.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
well,
the
problem
does
not
arise
while
the
mother
is
alive.
it
only
arises
when
the
mother
dies
and
at
that
time
it
becomes
biologically
impossible
perhaps
theologically
possible
to
marry
her.
as
long
as
the
mother
is
alive
state
--
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
it
was
in
his
power
but
the
problem
did
not
arise
and
(voice
overlap)
the
state
did
not
interfere
and
cannot
interfere
under
the
relationship
of
that.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
i
tend
to
believe
that
if
stanley
did
not
place
the
children
with
the
nesses
it
would
come
out
differently.
i
do
not
know.
i
do
not
think
it
is
difficult
to
say.
once
charges
were
brought,
the
court
had
to
make
the
only
finding
it
could
have.
there
is
no
defense
--
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
no.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
there
would
--
the
probation
officer
was
talking
about
perhaps
we
give
him
custody
if
he
--
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
right
and
i
think
all
these
people
really
--
i
was
not
at
the
trial.
but
i
think
all
these
people
merely
trying
to
placate
stanley
who
assumedly
was
very
upset
to
find
it.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
yes,
there
was
an
older
daughter
who
was
17,
there
was
a
neglect
petition
filed
against
stanley
and
it
was
proven
against
him.
i
was
the
prosecuting
attorney
in
that
case.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
yes,
no
by
the
same
the
marriage.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
that
is
correct.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
that
is
correct.
=
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
i
believe
that
it
may
have
been
something
to
do
with
charge
being
brought.
it
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
decision.
from
the
court’s
point
of
view
and
the
from
the
state’s
attorney’s
point,
it
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
decision.
in
the
probation
officer’s
point
of
view
i
do
not
know.
but
i
--
and
i
am
speaking
outside
the
record
now
from
knowing
the
court
and
the
state’s
attorney
personally
in
the
matters
obviously
which
are
not
relevant.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
i
was
not
the
prosecuting
attorney.
i
was
the
attorney
who
prosecuted
the
case.
there
is
a
slight
difference.
the
state’s
response
--
well
we
have
covered
most
of
the
points
already.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
adoption
that
it
is
our
point
of
view
--
that
it
is
what
we
believe
that
the
statutory
scheme
is
what
is
it
is
because
general
assembly
wished
to
make
plans
for
the
better
administration
of
the
adoption
statute.
between
the
years
1827
and
1949
in
illinois,
unwed
fathers
had
the
right
to
custody
of
their
children
merely
for
the
asking.
between
1827
and
1872,
all
they
had
to
do
is
demand
from
the
unwed
mother
the
child
and
she
had
to
deliver
them
up
or
the
father
could
stop
support
payments.
between
1872
and
1949,
it
was
after
the
child’s
tenth
birthday.
in
1946,
the
illinois
attorney
general
issued
an
opinion
which
held
that
was
stated
that
adoption
agencies
would
after
that
point
have
to
notify
any
unwed
father
of
adoption
proceedings.
and
if
in
fact,
the
unwed
father
were
unknown
then
the
guardian
would
have
to
be
appointed
for
this
purpose.
in
1949,
the
first
convenient
general
assembly
thereafter
the
illinois
state
legislature
amended
the
act
to
state
which
the
predecessor
of
today’s
paternity
act
that
no
unwed
father
would
have
any
right
to
custody
or
control
over
his
children
and
in
illinois
law
review
article
that
we
cite
here
point
out
that
this
was
merely
to
amend
the
paternity
act
to
keep
it
in
line
with
the
adoption
act.
the
juvenile
court
act
was
passed
in
1965.
there
is
no
historical
background
on
why
unwed
fathers
are
excluded
from
the
definition
of
parents
except
the
obvious
one
of
making
this
in
line
with
the
paternity
and
adoption
acts
in
the
state
of
illinois.
and
it
seems
quite
obvious
that
better
administration
of
the
adoption
act
is
not
a
compelling
reason.
in
fact,
it
is
not
rationally
related
at
all
to
the
classification
here
and
as
a
practical
matter,
it
does
not
succeed
in
what
it
wants
to
do
because
again
it
merely
allows
the
uninterested,
abandoning
and
unknown
unwed
fathers
not
to
come
into
court
while
it
forces
the
suitable
and
caring
for
unwed
fathers
to
come
to
court
to
demand
some
type
custody.
and
if
in
fact,
the
adoption
act
actually
did
force
these
unwed
fathers
to
come
before
it,
it
would
merely
clog
the
adoption
courts
with
unwed,
but
suitable
fathers
seeking
to
adopt
their
own
children.
i
think
what
happened
here,
we
believe
what
happened
here
is
that
the
general
assembly
never
considered
this
subclass
of
the
fathers
and
simply
made
a
law
to
make
the
juvenile
court
act
fit
in
with
the
adoption
act
never
considering
unwed
but
familial
fathers
and
of
course
this
type
of
father
like
japanese,
chinese
and
black
people
and
indigent
criminal
appellants
did
not
have
at
that
time
much
of
a
lobby
in
the
state
legislature.
so
for
the
reasons
which
we
have
stated
in
the
brief,
for
the
reasons
we
have
argued,
we
would
ask
that
this
court
reverse
the
opinion
of
the
illinois
supreme
court.
thank
you.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
i
would
find
difficulty,
your
honor.
the
court
there
did
suggest
the
right
of
custody
but
in
later
case
they
again
agreed
that
unwed
fathers
had
no
right
to
custody.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
the
adopt
--
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
i
would
assume
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
realized
that
he
may
have
had
the
theoretical
possibility
to
adopt
the
children
as
he
did
at
that
time.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
i
think
the
law
is
clear
that
he
has
a
theoretical
possibility
to
adopt.
i
believe
the
law
is
unclear
as
to
whether
he
has
a
right
to
custody.
you
see
vandollin
came
down
after
stanley
at
least
and
vandollin
said
no
right
of
custody.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
we
did
exhaust
our
state
remedy.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
we
did
exhaust
our
state
remedy.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
(inaudible)
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
yes
that
is
correct,
their
claim
is
that
--
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
fine.
first
of
course,
there
is
the
point
that
why
put
the
burden
on
him
to
go
the
adoption
when
we
do
not
do
it
to
anyone
else
and
that
is
our
claim
and
that
is
the
claim
the
illinois
supreme
court
answered
negatively
to
us.
secondly,
once
there
is
a
finding
of
wardship
we
have
to
appeal
within
30
days
which
we
did.
stanley
at
that
time
obviously
from
his
placement
with
his
children
with
the
nesses
a
practical
matter
could
not
adopt.
in
fact,
if
he
could
have
adopted
and
were
not
indigent,
we
would
not
be
before
this
court
today
as
a
practical
matter.
i
would
like
to
address
very
briefly
a
point
that
the
state
raised
and
that
is
that
he
could
have
married
joan
stanley
while
she
was
living
and
if
we
assume
this
we
are
assuming
that
all
women
are
weak
frivolous
creatures
that
any
man
has
to
say
please
marry
me
and
she
will.
there
is
no
evidence
there
was
not
joan
stanley
would
not
marry
peter
stanley
and
we
can
assume
that
in
many
cases
it
is
the
woman
who
will
not
marry
the
man
and
not
the
man
who
refuses
to
marry
the
woman.
so
what
happens
in
the
case
of
a
man
who
lives
for
18
years
with
the
woman
who
has
two
children
by
him
and
she
refuses
to
marry
him
and
then
she
dies.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
they
term
a
bachelor.
i
do
not
know,
but
they
tell
me,
the
longer
you
lived
with
person,
might
be
less
eligible.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
your
honor,
as
i
say
i
do
not
--
why
what
makes
a
woman
do
what
she
does
is
beyond
my
comprehension
very
well.
and
i
simply
do
not
know
why
a
woman
why
not
marry
a
man
certainly
i
think
just
about
any
woman
who
want
to
marry.[laughter]
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
but
the
--
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
well,
the
difference
is
there,
so
different
in
here.
there
it
was
merely
a
father’s
interest
in
gaining
the
estate
of
his
son.
here,
it
is
the
interest
of
a
father
who
has
built
a
familial
relationship
in
maintaining
that
relationship
with
his
children.
it
is
more
than
money
that
is
concerned
here.
mr.
patrick
t.
murphy
excuse
me,
it
was
the
other
way
around,
it
was
the
son.
but
again
it
was
matter
of
money
and
here
it
is
a
matter
of
familial
relationship.
thank
you
very
much.
