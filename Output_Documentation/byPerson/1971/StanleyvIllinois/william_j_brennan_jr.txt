brennan,

whereas
the
unwed
mother
i
gather
is
regarded
as
a
parent?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
the
children
are
to
be
taken
from
her,
it
is
only
for
neglect
as
a
mother?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
is
--
am
i
right
then
the
equal
protection
issue
comes
down
to
this,
that
illinois
will
allow
an
unwed
mother
in
his
circumstances
either
be
regarded
as
a
parent
for
whatever
purpose
and
that
is
important,
but
will
not
allow
an
unwed
father
in
these
circumstance
regard
as
parent,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally
i
know
that
your
brief
was
filed
before
this
court
decided
to
bind
the
(inaudible),
you
do
not
cite
it
in
your
brief,
although
the
respondent
does.
do
you
think
that
the
decision
of
the
court
in
that
case
has
any
bearing
on
the
issue
in
this
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
involved
--
the
court
said
there
was
no
equal
protection
for
illegitimates
under
the
--
or
it
was
inherited
under
the
louisiana
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
do
not
think
that
has
any
bearing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
has
to
take
it
that
not
denial
of
equal
protection
that
treats
the
unwed
father
different
from
the
unwed
mother?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
the
point
was
raised,
passed
on
(inaudible)
and
it
was
with
your
with
your
case
is
the
case
here
on
that
premise?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
we
not
have
to
reach
it?
do
we
not
have
to
reach
the
equal
protection
issue
on
that
premise
and
decide
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
you
do
not
understand
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
my
question
is
the
premise
in
which
the
case
here
is
that
he
is
the
father
of
the
children,
is
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright
and
the
equal
protection
argument
is
made
on
that
premise?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
guess
you
–-
is
this
what
you
summed
up
at
page
25
while
a
temperament
toward
child
rearing
may
be
largely
a
product
of
societal
condition,
these
temperamental
patterns
have
been
so
deeply
ingrained
within
rest
of
the
civilization,
that
they
cannot
be
ignored?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
did
he
do
all
things
that
you
say
that
a
married
father
would
do
from
the
birth
of
these
children
until
the
time
that
joan
stanley
died?
i
gather
from
this
record
that
that
is
the
fact.
he
did
not
get
into
this
difficulty
until
after
her
death,
but
he
did
everything
apparently
that
that
he
had
been
married
to
joan.
