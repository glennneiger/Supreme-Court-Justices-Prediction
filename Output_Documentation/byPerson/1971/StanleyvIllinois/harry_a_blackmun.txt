do
you
think
mr.
murphy
this
case
would
have
come
up
the
way
it
did
below
if
stanley
instead
of
being
indigent
had
been
in
the
position,
financially
to
provide
for
these
children?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
i
am
really
trying
to
get
at,
is
his
indigency
have
a
controlling
weight
in
the
decision?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
notice
that
you
quoted
in
page
5
of
your
brief
that
a
probation
officer
who
said
that
if
he
had
been
in
the
position
to
financially
to
provide
properly
for
the
children
in
the
future
or
to
become
so,
there
might
be
a
reconsideration
of
the
case.
justice

give
him
custody?

you
know,
do
other

have
situations

like
this?
justice

mr.
murphy
what
could
she
possibly
gain
by
not
marrying
him
under
the
circumstances?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
a
little
while
ago
you
said
that
levine
against
vincent
was
of
no
consequence
here
and
yet
there
also
the
opportunity
was
afforded
the
father
to
have
legitimatized
these
children
for
inheritance
purposes
in
any
event
and
he
failed
to
do
so.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
now
i
take
it
it
you
distinguish
this
because
you
say
marriage
is
a
two-way
street?
justice
harry

the

was
not
interested
in
gaining
