mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
mr,
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
essentially
a
very
simple
issue
is
involved
here,
not
the
very
complex
issue
that
mr.
wallace
refers
to
because
most
of
the
things
that
he
talks
about
are
either
rules
and
regulations
that
have
been
adopted
since
this
case
was
before
the
court
below
as
to
which,
the
administrative
process
had
not
yet
even
been
completed
and
the
other
aspect
of
which
what
happens
with
voluntary
origination.
the
rules
and
regulations
commission
were
not
passed
upon
by
the
court
below
and
not
before
this
court.
what's
involved
here
is
the
simple
requirement
of
the
commission
that
says
to
a
catv
system.
if
you
understand
a
business
as
a
catv
system,
you
have
got
to
originate
programs,
you
got
to
become
a
broadcast
station
in
effect.
if
you
refuse
to
do
that,
you
have
got
to
cease
being
a
catv
system.
and
i
think
it
might
be
helpful
if
i
just
backed
up
a
little
bit
and
gave
a
little
bit
of
history
of
catv,
so
as
to
show
how
it
fills
in
with
respect
to
what
the
commission
has
done
in
this
case.
catv
started
when
television
broadcast
stations
were
not
able
to
fill
in
and
provide
service
to
their
entire
service
area,
principally
communities
located
in
valleys,
where
there
are
mountains
in
between
the
television
antenna
and
the
community
whereas
the
television
signal
might
extend
for
miles
beyond
this
particular
community,
they
were
unable
to
receive
the
signals,
television
signals
go
line
aside
and
the
mountains
cut
them
off.
so
individual
entrepreneurs
undertook
to
put
an
antenna
on
top
of
the
mountain
where
the
signal
was
available,
capture
it,
bring
it
down
by
cable
into
the
community
and
then
to
distribute
it.
they
started
off
originally,
people
doing
it
for
themselves
then
making
it
available
to
their
neighbors
and
they
suddenly
realized
that
when
their
neighbors
came
around
that
this
was
the
sort
of
the
service
that
everybody
want
to
have
and
it
became
a
business
that
they
would
charge
people
for
the
opportunity
of
being
able
to
get
television
service
that
otherwise
was
not
available.
and
basically,
while
the
rates
for
this
service
tends
to
vary
throughout
united
states,
mostly
they
are
now
between
the
low
of
$4
and
a
high
of
$6
per
month
for
this
service.
as
the
institution
developed,
what
happened
was
in
some
communities,
they
did
have
their
own
television
stations
but
they
maybe
only
had
one
or
two.
by
means
of
catv,
sometimes
by
bringing
them
the
signals
by
high
antenna
or
sometimes
by
microwave,
you
were
able
to
bring
in
the
three
networks
and
maybe
independent
stations
whereas
people
could
get
some
free
television
in
their
communities
from
the
one
or
two
stations
there.
they
were
willing
to
pay
this
$4
to
$6
a
month
for
the
ability
to
be
able
to
get
three-four-five
or
six
signals
which
were
distributed
over
the
same
cable.
initially,
the
federal
communications
commission
paid
no
attention
to
this
phenomena,
neither
did
the
broadcasting
stations.
quite
to
the
contrary
the
broadcast
stations
were
very
happy
with
what
catv
was
doing
because
it
was
really
filling
out
their
service
area
in
a
way
that
geography
and
terrains
had
not
intervened,
the
signal
would
be
available
and
obviously
the
more
people
who
are
able
to
receive
the
signal,
the
better
for
the
broadcast
station
because
the
broadcast
station
was
able
to
sell
advertising
on
the
basis
of
a
circulation.
but
as
this
started
to
proliferate,
and
the
commission
initially
even
said,
it
had
no
jurisdiction
on
the
subject
matter.
but
as
it
started
to
proliferate,
and
as
the
importation
of
signals
tended
to
create
an
economic
problem
for
some
of
the
existing
television
stations
because
obviously
if
you
are
the
only
television
station
in
town,
with
no
catv,
you
have
a
captive
audience,
people
either
listen
to
you
or
don't
listen
anyone
at
all.
but
when
catv
brought
in
signals
from
two-three
or
four
stations,
it
fractionated
the
audience.
people
were
given
the
program
choice,
this
is
what
the
law
and
the
policy
of
our
government
demands
but
obviously
the
local
broadcaster
was
unhappy
because
he
was
losing
his
monopoly.
so
he
began
to
complain
to
the
commission
about
this
process
and
the
commission
undertook
to
regulate
catv
systems
to
the
extent
that
they
imported
signals
and
they
adopted
basically
two
types
of
rules
and
regulations
on
the
subject.
one
was
a
rule
and
regulation
that
said,
that
a
catv
system
must
carry
all
local
signals.
in
other
words,
if
the
signal
is
locally
available
in
a
community,
the
catv
system
must
put
it
on
its
system.
now
this
seems
self-evident
but
at
least
at
the
outset,
when
catv
systems
got
started
and
when
capacity
on
catv
system
was
rather
limited.
the
local
station
many
time
would
not
particularly
(inaudible)
and
the
catv
system
would
bring
in
signals
from
outside,
that
were
more
salable
and
the
local
station
therefore
would
tend
to
have
difficulty
in
getting
an
audience
because
once
a
person
was
on
a
cable,
if
the
local
station
was
not
on
a
cable,
that
subscriber
would
have
difficulty
in
getting
a
local
station.
so
the
commission
said
as
a
minimum
matter,
you
must
carry
all
local
signals
so
as
to
make
sure
that
the
local
station
does
not
effect
us
and
certainly
the
commission
said
that
we
will
restrict
the
importation
of
distant
signals
because
since
distance
signals
come
in
to
the
market
and
tend
to
fractionate
the
audience.
it
might
cause
a
problem
so
far
as
the
local
station
is
concerned.
we
will
restrict
it
to
make
sure
that
you
don't
overdo
it,
we
will
undertake
to
strike
a
balance.
so
as
to
make
sure
that
you
do
--
you
are
able
to
bring
in
enough
signal
so
that
when
added
to
the
local
signals,
people
get
adequate
service
and
by
that
they
generally
meant
that
they
are
able
to
get
service
at
least
from
the
three
networks.
but
beyond
that
they
wouldn't
permit
it.
that
was
challenged
and
ultimately
this
court
in
southwestern
did
sustain
the
authority
of
the
commission
to
adopt
such
rules
and
regulations
because
these
rules
and
regulations
were
ancillary
to
the
commission's
authority
with
respect
to
broadcasting.
catv
systems,
the
commission
held
and
this
court
agreed,
are
engaged
in
communication
by
wire
or
radio
within
the
meaning
in
the
air.
now,
while
they
are
not
broadcast
station
themselves,
they
are
instrumentality
medium
and
in
purpose
of
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
they
because
they
are
carrying
broadcast
signals,
that's
right.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
that's
right,
they
are
really
preforming
no
different
function
in
that
respect
than
you
do
in
your
home,
when
you
put
an
antenna
on
top
of
your
roof,
you
have
a
wire
coming
down
from
the
antenna
into
your
set.
this
is
obviously
a
much
more
sophisticated
wire
but
they
were
doing
the
same
thing.
they
were
also
capturing
the
signal
on
the
antenna
and
distributing
over
a
long
wire
to
many
people.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
no
that
wasn't
even
involved
at
that
time.
quite
a
contrary,
when
this
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
to
carry
what?
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
yes,
that
was
what
was
involved
there,
the
commission
said
as
part
of
out
authority.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
the
rule
was
involved
in
that
case
that
wasn't
challenged.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
yeah
that
particular
moment
wasn't
challenged
but
in
another
case,
which
midwest
had
brought
in
the
eight
circuit
where
that
rule
was
challenged,
the
eight
circuit
did
uphold
that
regulation
and
so
it
was
not
solved.
so
the
courts
have
upheld
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
that's
the
position
we
took
several
years
ago
and
we
were
not
able
to
persuade
the
courts
that
that
was
correct.
the
reason
we
took
was
on
that
just
for
a
little
history
was
that
this
was
a
reception
service
and
the
commission
only
has
jurisdiction
over
transmission
service.
the
courts
agreed
with
the
commission
on
that,
said
you
can
adopt
rules
and
regulation
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
no,
in
this
case,
not
at
all.
not
only
it
wouldn't
invalidate
that
rule
but
it
wouldn't
invalidate
the
rules
and
regulations
that
the
commission
had
adopted
that
said
that
if
you
voluntarily
originate,
you
will
have
to
comply
with
the
fairness
doctrine,
you
have
to
comply
with
(inaudible)
law,
with
all
the
other
rules
and
regulation
with
respect
to
it.
there
are
difficult
legal
questions
i
think
that
your
honor
was
adverting
to
on
questioning
mr.
wallace
as
to
whether
there
are
not
constitutional
queasiness
about
that
because
there
is
not
at
the
same
scarcity
involved
there
but
that's
not
involved
here
and
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
well
the
state's
--
the
commission,
at
this
stage
of
the
game
is
undertaking
in
many
areas
to
pre-empt
the
theory
of
state
regulation,
the
states
are
fighting
that
and
that
matter
is
now
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
that
is
not,
the
state
illinois
has
filed
a
brief
for
amicus
in
this
court
which
they
assert
that
it
is
involved.
i
don't
think
it
is
involved
myself
and
i
don't
think
the
government
feels
that's
involved
but
the
states
at
least
see
where
it's
leading
to,
getting
into
this
problem
really.
i
don't
think
this
particular
rule
and
regulation
does
involve
the
divisions
of
authority
between
the
federal
and
state
authority
but
we
think
that
the
politics
compel
someone
to
go
into
a
business
that
he
doesn't
want
to,
the
state
will
let
that
politics
as
much
as
the
fcc
does.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
some
municipalities,
when
you
have
to
get
a
franchise
from
municipality
to
operate
a
catv
system
because
your
wires
cross
over
alleys
and
screeching,
you
have
to
get
a
franchise
from
it.
now
some
of
those
franchises
require
the
catv
operator
to
originate
problems.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
what?
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
not
automatically
because
we
think
that
what’s
involved
here
is
an
absence
of
statutory
authority
with
constitutional
overtones
but
we
don't
think
you
have
reached
a
reached
the
constitutional
problem
because
there’s
an
absence
of
statutory
authority.
but
if
the
constitutional
overtone
to
argument
is
involved,
the
same
constitutional
limitation
would
be
applicable
to
the
municipalities
or
applicable
to
federal
governments.
but
that
is
not
involved
here
because
i
think
we
don't
reach
that
because
the
commission
has
not
been
given
this
authority
by
congress,
where
the
congress
could
give
it
the
authority,
is
not
entirely
a
clear
question
and
it
would
depend
entirely
on
a
type
of
statute
that
congress
drafted,
the
type
of
findings
they
made
as
to
whether
they
could,
as
to
what
would
be
involved,
but
that's
not
involved
here.
we
think
it's
very
clear,
that
congress
has
not
given
the
fcc
authority
with
respect
to
that.
what
congress
did
give
the
commission
authority
so
far
as
reception
activities
are
concerned
is
that
you
can
adapt
rules
and
regulations,
that
are
reasonably
ancillary
to
your
regulation
of
broadcast
station.
and
for
example,
with
respect
to
your
mandatory
carriage
of
all
local
signals.
since
the
commission
in
section
3,
303(a),
and
303(h)
of
the
communication
provides
that
the
commission
has
the
authority
to
classify
radio
stations
and
to
prescribe
the
areas
to
be
served
by
them.
well,
obviously
it's
ancillary
to
that
jurisdiction
says
the
court
for
the
commission
to
require
local
catv
system
to
carry
local
signal.
because
if
they
don't,
the
area
that
the
commission
has
prescribed
for
a
broadcast
station,
is
cut-off
by
the
same
token
when
the
commission
says
that
you
shall
not
import
distant
signals
beyond
where
they
are
intended
to
be
carried.
for
example,
if
you
are
operating
a
system
that
cast
for
wyoming
and
you’re
trying
to
import
a
signal
from
denver,
colorado,
you’re
obviously
extending
that
signal
beyond
the
area
which
the
commission
had
prescribed
which
that
station
is
to
be
served.
the
commission
under
certain
circumstances
do
permit
those
signals
to
be
imported,
but
permitted
only
for
the
purpose
of
making
sure
that
the
people
in
riverton,
wyoming
have
enough
reception
services.
so
that
was
the
theory
upon
which
the
commission
upheld
authority
in
the
southwestern
case
because
it
was
reasonably
ancillary
to
broadcast
jurisdiction
over
television
station.
now
catv
system
in
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
that's
right,
that's
right.
and
this
is
why
this
does
perform
a
very
important
public
interest
function
and
when
they
do
perform
their
function,
if
there
are
engagements,
state
communication
by
wire
or
radio,
they
are
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
that
congress
has
given
to
the
commission,
to
make
sure
that
it
carries
out
to
policies
of
regulating
broadcast
stations
is
not
inconsistent
therewith.
now
a
catv
system,
in
this
essence
is
a
very,
very
simple
matter.
it
erects
an
antenna,
cables
come
down,
distribute
it
to
the
people
who
paid
$4
to
$6
a
month
for
that
service.
the
pertinent
is
relatively
simple.
the
personnel
involved
in
it
are
relatively
few
in
number
and
unsophisticated
personnel,
the
people
that
string
cables
or
maintain
cables,
will
hook
up
television
receivers
and
a
small
billing
department
that
goes
out
and
bills
the
people
$4
to
$6
a
month
and
collects
it.
now
the
commission
comes
along
and
says,
catv
operates
in
many
small
communities
that
don't
have
their
own
television
stations.
wouldn't
it
be
nice
if
those
communities
had
television
stations?
and
therefore
the
commission
said
that
if
you’re
going
to
stay
in
the
business,
since
you
are
using
broadcast
signals
--
if
you're
going
to
stay
in
the
business
of
providing
broadcast
stations,
we
want
to
know,
we
want,
we
demand
that
if
you
have
3,500
or
more
subscribers,
that
you
must
also
become
a
broadcast
station
and
that's
what
cablecasting
needs.
you
must
become
a
broadcast
station,
you
must
originate
your
own
programs.
you
must
have
facilities
available
for
local
program
and
you
must
originate
it.
now
this
is
an
entirely
a
business
activity
from
what
catv
is
involved
in.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
under
the
statute
that
congress
had
drafted,
i
say
they
do
not
have
the
statutory
authority,
that
is
correct.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
under
any
of
the
present
statute.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
under
present
statute
they
are
not.
i
should
point
out
to
your
honor
that
in
a
somewhat
related
field,
when
television
receivers
were
first
been
marketed,
they
would
be
marketed
with
vhf
channels
only,
even
though
they
were
both
vhf
and
uhf
channels,
the
television
receivers
have
been
marketed
with
vhf
channels
only
and
the
commission
–
the
television
was
not
getting
off
to
ground
so
far
as
uhf
was
concerned.
the
commission
went
to
congress,
to
get
a
statute
passed
that
says
if
you
manufacture
television
receivers
you
must
make
sure
that
they
have
all
the
channels.
the
commission
felt
the
need
of
going
to
congress
to
get
some
specific
statutory
authority,
desirable
as
the
objective
was.
they
felt
powerless
to
doing
things
without
getting
an
enactment
of
congress.
the
commission
has
similarly
gone
to
congress
in
the
area
of
catv
to
try
to
get
additional
or
supplementary
legislation
and
congress
had
not
done
anything
on
the
subject.
not
that
congress
has
approved,
congress
has
sat
back
and
is
watching
what's
happening.
but
the
need
to
go
to
the
congress
to
get
authority
in
this
field
is
very,
very
clear.
in
the
reception
field,
where
they
had
to
get
a
statute
which
section
303(s)
which
specifically
authorizes
the
commission
to
prevent
the
shipment
in
interstate
commerce
of
any
television
receiver
unless
it
carries
both
vhf
and
uhf,
so
that
the
entire
spectrum
can
be
utilized.
now,
what
the
fcc
is
telling
to
a
catv
system,
is
you
must
become
a
broadcaster.
not
only
must
you
have
this
simple
equipment
up
there
for
distributing
signals,
you
have
got
to
go
out
and
buy
cameras.
you
have
got
to
go
out
and
buy
a
microphone.
you
have
got
to
hire
people
who
creates
programs.
we
don't
create
programs
as
the
catv
system
where
a
passive
distributor
programs,
we're
really
performing
the
function
of
distributing
the
signals
that
are
dedicated
to
the
public,
we're
making
them
available
to
the
people,
that's
a
simple
dedicated
function.
we
are
not
created
people
in
the
sense
of,
of
being
able
to
create
a
program.
they
say,
we
got
to
buy
the
equipment,
the
color
--
the
television
cameras
to
project
the
images,
sophisticated
people
who
can
create
programs,
to
the
extent
that
their
copyright
programs
are
involved.
we
got
to
go
out
and
get
copyrights
on
all
those
and
even
under
fortnightly
there
is
no
doubt,
that
when
we
originate
a
program
that
involved
copyrighted
material,
we
must
get
a
copyright
license.
we
never
contended
that
we
can
do
it
without
a
copyright
license.
not
like
that,
but
we
submit
ourselves
to
a
whole
new
area
of
regulation
of
the
commission,
we
got
to
learn
about
fairness,
we
got
to
learn
about
the
equal
opportunity,
the
volumes
and
volumes
of
commission
regulations
that
they
have
adopted,
dealing
with
broadcast
that
we've
got
to
learn
about.
we're
not
challenging
that,
that
if
we
do
it
voluntarily.
but
we're
saying
this,
as
an
entirely
different
business
activity
from
what's
been
involved
in,
when
we
dedicated
our
property
really
to
being
a
catv
operator.
the
commission
now
comes
to
say,
find
your
catv
operator,
but
we
now
want
to
enter
into
an
entirely
different
business
activity
from
what
you
yourself
undertook
to
do.
that's
what's
involved
in
mandatory
origination.
the
commission
in
effect
says,
if
you're
all
okay
even
in
a
small
community,
even
if
when
there
is
no
other
television
stations
involved.
so
you're
not
having
an
impact
on,
and
if
you
have
5,000
subscribers,
important
as
your
services,
bringing
television
service
to
those
people
who
might
not
get
it
otherwise.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
yes.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
the
commission
says
to
him,
that
you
can't
operate
a
broadcast
station
without
a
license,
and
license
requires
you
to
operate
in
the
public
interest.
when
you
come
to
us
and
say,
you
want
a
station
to
operate
in
public
interest,
then
they
say,
you've
got
to
comply
with
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
only
to
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
well,
but
the
license
that
the
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
they
have
to
get
permission
from
the
commission.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
that's
what
they
are
saying,
what
we
are
saying.
but
that's
the
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
the
difference
between
the
two
situations
in
effect
they
are
saying
is,
that
if
you
want
to
carry
broadcast
signals,
you
must
become
something
additional
to
that.
you
must
become
a
broadcast
station.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
yes.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
the
innovative
question
that
mr.
justice
white
asked
and
is
really
the
novel
case
is,
as
to
what
is
the
nature
of
the
undertaking
of
the
commission's
jurisdictions.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
the
quintessence
of
the
question
that
we
use
broadcast
signal,
because
it's
an
implication,
not
only
an
implication
a
direct
statement
to
commission,
that
there
is
a
benefit
conferred
that
since
we
used
broadcast
signal.
but
basically,
this
is
not
a
parasitic
or
an
exploitation
relationship,
it's
a
symbiotic
relationship.
broadcast
signals
when
they
are
transmitted
over
the
year
are
worthless
unless
there
is
something
on
the
other
end
to
receive
and
then
making
use
of
it.
we
are
just
as
much
a
part
of
it,
not
as
a
recipient
of
the
benefit,
but
as
a
part
of
the
symbiotic
processes
as
well.
we
are
no
different
than
the
sale,
than
the
local
dealer,
that
makes
television
sets
to
make
them
available
to
the
people
so
that
they
can
receive
the
broadcast.
obviously,
if
no
one
will
make
them
broadcast,
there
would
be
no
market
facets.
but
by
the
same
token,
if
no
one
were
making
sets
there
would
be
no
purpose
in
transmitting
signals
over
the
year.
it's
a
duality
of
the
process,
to
tell
us
that
just
because
we
utilize
broadcast
signals
in
a
manner
in
which
they
are
intended
to
be
utilized,
and
in
a
manner
which
unless
we
did
something
with
them,
they
wouldn't
be
useful
at
all,
that
therefore
we
should
now
undertake
to
become
a
broadcast
station
in
effect
as
to
be
able
to
tell
the
manufacturer
of
television
receivers
or
the
sales
or
television
receiver,
since
you
are
making
use
of
broadcast
signals.
you
want
to
do
some,
you
want
to
go
in
and
open
a
broadcast
station
in
your
town.
we
are
undertaking
positive
process,
the
commission
has
certain
jurisdiction
over
one
part
of
process
and
another
type
of
jurisdiction
over
the
other
part
of
the
process,
but
no
where
has
the
congress
given
the
commission
the
power
to
say
that
if
you
do
part
of
the
process,
you
also
must
do
another
part
of
the
process.
and
this
is,
it's
like
in
the
case
of
frost
&
frost
(ph)
where
we
cited
in
effect
where
the
state
of
california
told
this
gentleman
if
you
want
to
use
our
road,
you've
got
to
be
not
just
a
private
contractor
for
hire,
you
must
be
a
common
carrier
for
hire.
and
the
supreme
court
said,
no,
you
can
make
reasonable
regulations
relating
to
the
use
of
the
road,
and
you
may
have
even
forbid
the
use
of
the
road,
but
you
can't
say
that
if
you
utilized
the
road,
you
can
at
the
same
time,
say
now
since
you
are
utilizing
the
road,
you
have
become
a
common
carrier
even
though
that's
not
what
you
intended
to
dedicate
your
property
to.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
what
i
am
saying
--
that's
what
they
are
trying
to
say,
and
i
am
not
saying
that
it's
an
un-worthy
thing
that
they
are
trying
to
do,
but
in
effect
they
are
telling
us
who
only
want
to
be
--
to
manufacture
and
install
receivers
or
to
install
receivers
since
we
are
performing
that
function,
we
ought
to
do
something
else.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
that's
right.
now
if
congress
had
said
that
this
whole
business
of
installing,
as
a
new
business
okay,
that
if
you
install
and
so
forth,
that
as
part
of
that,
there
ought
to
be
certain
responsibilities
to
it,
that
could
be
another
matter.
but
so
far
as
our
function
is
concerned,
and
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
fortnightly,
true
from
a
copyright
point
of
view,
what
we
do
is
perform
the
reception
part
of
this,
and
not
the
transmission
part.
it's
an
entirely
different
activity
that
they
are
asking
us
to
do,
it's
not
like
the
broadcast
station,
when
a
man
who
enters
into
operating
a
broadcast
station
must
operate
in
the
public
interest.
but
at
the
same
--
what
they
can
do
the
analogy
is
–
they
say,
if
you
got
to
be
a
catv
system,
you
got
to
be
a
catv
system
which
means
you
got
to
carry
the
local
signals,
means
you
got
to
carry
them
in
such
a
way
as
not
to
degrade
them,
that
you
must
meet
certain
technical
standards
in
your
operation
of
a
catv
function.
we
have
no
problem,
that's
the
business
where
in
it's
legitimate
and
severable
business,
and
the
commission
can
lay
down
rules
and
regulations
that
if
we
enter
the
catv
business
we
must
do
it,
in
appropriate
manner,
and
that's
what
southwestern
was
all
about.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
in
the
public
interest
related
to
the
reception
functions,
and
there
is
ancillary
to
the
broadcast
function.
i
don't
see
how
it's
ancillary
to
the
broadcast
function
to
tell
us
that
we
must
become
a
broadcast
station
in
effect
in
a
way
that
might
yield
benefits
to
the
public.
but
it
does
not
help
the
broadcast
stations
in
any
event
to
have
us
become
a
competitor
by
originating
problems.
the
whole
theory
of
regulation,
even
in
a
broadcast
field,
those
of
us
who
come
from
small
towns
who
don't
have
any
broadcast
stations
--
we'd
love
to
have
had
broadcast
station.
the
commission
has
never
had
the
power
to
say
to
someone
that
you've
got
to
go
in,
and
operate
the
broadcast
station
in
that
particular
town.
they
will
say,
if
you
want
to
operate
a
station
in
that
town,
you
have
got
to
live
up
to
certain
rules
and
regulation.
but
the
affirmative
requirement
that
tells
someone
that
he
must
operate
a
broadcast
station
is
really
what's
involved
here.
that's
imposing
a
duty
on
difference
of
time,
not
just
of
decree,
not
just
a
definition.
they
can
tell
us
how
to
operate
a
catv
business,
the
quintessence
of
a
catv
system.
but
when
they
say
beyond
that,
you
now
must
undertake
to
operate
in
addition,
a
broadcast
station.
the
correlative
of
this
would
be,
when
in
the
area
before
there
was
an
old
channel
law
that
is
to
say,
when
people
were
operating
either
vhf
or
uhf
television
stations
and
the
commission
said,
television
is
not
getting
its
maximum
potential
for
the
simple
reason
that
there
aren't
enough
either
cheap
receivers
out
or
there
aren't
enough
receivers
outstanding
that
are
capable
of
receiving
uhf
and
therefore
as
a
condition
of
operating
your
television
station,
we
insist
that
you
go
into
the
manufacturing
business
and
manufacturer
receivers,
so
that
people
around
to
be
able
to
receive
those
signals.
and
not
only
didn't
the
commission
undertake
to
do
that
with
respect
to
broadcast
as
i
mentioned
earlier
even
with
respect
to
manufacture,
to
manufacturing
receivers
it
took
a
specific
enactment
of
congress
to
enable
the
commission
to
be
able
to
tell
the
manufactures
that
in
order
to
engage
in
this
business
your
receiver
must
carry
all
channels,
and
not
just
the
channels
that
you
want
to
put
on.
when
the
commission
adopted
these
rules
and
regulations
which
says
that
you
can't
have
the
luxury
of
carrying
only
distant
signal
that
if
you
got
to
be
a
catv
system,
you
must
carry
local
signal.
that
was
enabling
them
to
regulate
the
business
that
we
have
gone
into
perform
and
a
recipient
function.
if
they
say
that
the
signal
must
have
a
certain
quality
to
make
sure
that
the
public
gets
the
same
quality
of
signal
on
their
set
that's
been
transmitted
by
the
station.
that
also
is
part
of
it.
but
to
say
in
addition,
that
we
must
become
a
broadcast
station
is
in
effect
--
the
analogy
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
like
the
distributor
of
the
new
york
times
in
washington
for
example,
is
performing
a
function,
he
is
taking
advantage
of
newspaper
function.
if
some
local
authority
said
that
in
return
for
that
privilege,
we
don't
think
there
is
enough
local
newspapers
in
town,
we
think
that
you
ought
to
publish
a
local
newspaper.
this
is
what
the
commission
is
doing.
we
are
not
arguing
with
the
desirability
of
the
function.
what
we
are
saying
is
under
our
system
of
regulation
that
this
volition
that
goes
into
business,
that
you
cannot
be
compelled
to
dedicate
your
property
to
a
business
that
you
don't
use.
that
you
--
that
when
you
enter
a
business
you
are
subject
to
rules
and
regulations,
and
if
we
voluntarily
originate
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
we
can't
originate
and
fail
to
comply
with
the
same
fairness,
equal
opportunity
(inaudible)
law
that
does
a
broadcast
station.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
that's
correct.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
that's
right.
it
is,
and
that's
why
i
am
saying,
we
are
not
arguing
whether
it's
reasonable.
now,
we
are
not
arguing
that
the
length
should
be
3,500
or
6,000
or
10,000,
we
are
not
arguing
on
that.
but
what
we
are
arguing
is
it's
not
within
the
statutory
jurisdiction
to
compel
us
to
do
this.
i
do
want
to
mention
one
further
fact
it's
not
crucial
to
the
case,
but
mr.
justice
douglas
had
asked
whether
there
are
any
grandfather
rights
with
respect
to
this.
the
grandfather
right
is
not
applicable
here,
this
is
applicable
all
catv
system
no
matter
when
they
started.
the
grandfather
rights
that
the
commission
had
recognized
in
this
field,
pertained
to
the
situation
that
you
are
permitted
to
continue
to
carry
the
broadcast
signal
that
you
did
before.
but
no
grandfather
protection
has
been
recorded
in
this
thing.
we
don't
think
that's
crucial
because
we
think
the
statutory
jurisdiction
is
lacking
for
new
system
as
well
as
old
system.
but
i
didn't
want
the
record
to
be
vague
on
that
point.
in
summary,
the
position
that
we
have
taken
is
that
as
a
matter
of
statutory
authority,
the
commission
is
authorized
to
regulate
broadcast
station.
they
are
authorized
to
regulate
catv
system
only
to
the
extent
that's
reasonably
ancillary
to
broadcast
function,
and
that
relates
to
the
type
of
rules
and
regulation
as
to
carry
the
broadcast
signals.
we
do
not
argue
because
it's
not
involved
as
to
whether
if
we
undertake
voluntary
origination
that
we
are
not
subject
to
the
same
rules
and
regulation,
as
are
applicable
to
broadcast
station
that
is
not
before
the
court,
we
are
not
contesting
insofar
as
this
record
is
concerned.
we
do
say
though
that
we
cannot
be
compelled
to
enter
into
a
brand
new
and
entirely
different
kind
of
business
as
a
condition
of
performing
the
function,
or
making
the
signals
available
that
are
dedicated
to
the
public,
by
taking
those
signals
and
putting
them
to
the
use
for
which
the
dedication
was
contemplated.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
mr,
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
essentially
a
very
simple
issue
is
involved
here,
not
the
very
complex
issue
that
mr.
wallace
refers
to
because
most
of
the
things
that
he
talks
about
are
either
rules
and
regulations
that
have
been
adopted
since
this
case
was
before
the
court
below
as
to
which,
the
administrative
process
had
not
yet
even
been
completed
and
the
other
aspect
of
which
what
happens
with
voluntary
origination.
the
rules
and
regulations
commission
were
not
passed
upon
by
the
court
below
and
not
before
this
court.
what's
involved
here
is
the
simple
requirement
of
the
commission
that
says
to
a
catv
system.
if
you
understand
a
business
as
a
catv
system,
you
have
got
to
originate
programs,
you
got
to
become
a
broadcast
station
in
effect.
if
you
refuse
to
do
that,
you
have
got
to
cease
being
a
catv
system.
and
i
think
it
might
be
helpful
if
i
just
backed
up
a
little
bit
and
gave
a
little
bit
of
history
of
catv,
so
as
to
show
how
it
fills
in
with
respect
to
what
the
commission
has
done
in
this
case.
catv
started
when
television
broadcast
stations
were
not
able
to
fill
in
and
provide
service
to
their
entire
service
area,
principally
communities
located
in
valleys,
where
there
are
mountains
in
between
the
television
antenna
and
the
community
whereas
the
television
signal
might
extend
for
miles
beyond
this
particular
community,
they
were
unable
to
receive
the
signals,
television
signals
go
line
aside
and
the
mountains
cut
them
off.
so
individual
entrepreneurs
undertook
to
put
an
antenna
on
top
of
the
mountain
where
the
signal
was
available,
capture
it,
bring
it
down
by
cable
into
the
community
and
then
to
distribute
it.
they
started
off
originally,
people
doing
it
for
themselves
then
making
it
available
to
their
neighbors
and
they
suddenly
realized
that
when
their
neighbors
came
around
that
this
was
the
sort
of
the
service
that
everybody
want
to
have
and
it
became
a
business
that
they
would
charge
people
for
the
opportunity
of
being
able
to
get
television
service
that
otherwise
was
not
available.
and
basically,
while
the
rates
for
this
service
tends
to
vary
throughout
united
states,
mostly
they
are
now
between
the
low
of
$4
and
a
high
of
$6
per
month
for
this
service.
as
the
institution
developed,
what
happened
was
in
some
communities,
they
did
have
their
own
television
stations
but
they
maybe
only
had
one
or
two.
by
means
of
catv,
sometimes
by
bringing
them
the
signals
by
high
antenna
or
sometimes
by
microwave,
you
were
able
to
bring
in
the
three
networks
and
maybe
independent
stations
whereas
people
could
get
some
free
television
in
their
communities
from
the
one
or
two
stations
there.
they
were
willing
to
pay
this
$4
to
$6
a
month
for
the
ability
to
be
able
to
get
three-four-five
or
six
signals
which
were
distributed
over
the
same
cable.
initially,
the
federal
communications
commission
paid
no
attention
to
this
phenomena,
neither
did
the
broadcasting
stations.
quite
to
the
contrary
the
broadcast
stations
were
very
happy
with
what
catv
was
doing
because
it
was
really
filling
out
their
service
area
in
a
way
that
geography
and
terrains
had
not
intervened,
the
signal
would
be
available
and
obviously
the
more
people
who
are
able
to
receive
the
signal,
the
better
for
the
broadcast
station
because
the
broadcast
station
was
able
to
sell
advertising
on
the
basis
of
a
circulation.
but
as
this
started
to
proliferate,
and
the
commission
initially
even
said,
it
had
no
jurisdiction
on
the
subject
matter.
but
as
it
started
to
proliferate,
and
as
the
importation
of
signals
tended
to
create
an
economic
problem
for
some
of
the
existing
television
stations
because
obviously
if
you
are
the
only
television
station
in
town,
with
no
catv,
you
have
a
captive
audience,
people
either
listen
to
you
or
don't
listen
anyone
at
all.
but
when
catv
brought
in
signals
from
two-three
or
four
stations,
it
fractionated
the
audience.
people
were
given
the
program
choice,
this
is
what
the
law
and
the
policy
of
our
government
demands
but
obviously
the
local
broadcaster
was
unhappy
because
he
was
losing
his
monopoly.
so
he
began
to
complain
to
the
commission
about
this
process
and
the
commission
undertook
to
regulate
catv
systems
to
the
extent
that
they
imported
signals
and
they
adopted
basically
two
types
of
rules
and
regulations
on
the
subject.
one
was
a
rule
and
regulation
that
said,
that
a
catv
system
must
carry
all
local
signals.
in
other
words,
if
the
signal
is
locally
available
in
a
community,
the
catv
system
must
put
it
on
its
system.
now
this
seems
self-evident
but
at
least
at
the
outset,
when
catv
systems
got
started
and
when
capacity
on
catv
system
was
rather
limited.
the
local
station
many
time
would
not
particularly
(inaudible)
and
the
catv
system
would
bring
in
signals
from
outside,
that
were
more
salable
and
the
local
station
therefore
would
tend
to
have
difficulty
in
getting
an
audience
because
once
a
person
was
on
a
cable,
if
the
local
station
was
not
on
a
cable,
that
subscriber
would
have
difficulty
in
getting
a
local
station.
so
the
commission
said
as
a
minimum
matter,
you
must
carry
all
local
signals
so
as
to
make
sure
that
the
local
station
does
not
effect
us
and
certainly
the
commission
said
that
we
will
restrict
the
importation
of
distant
signals
because
since
distance
signals
come
in
to
the
market
and
tend
to
fractionate
the
audience.
it
might
cause
a
problem
so
far
as
the
local
station
is
concerned.
we
will
restrict
it
to
make
sure
that
you
don't
overdo
it,
we
will
undertake
to
strike
a
balance.
so
as
to
make
sure
that
you
do
--
you
are
able
to
bring
in
enough
signal
so
that
when
added
to
the
local
signals,
people
get
adequate
service
and
by
that
they
generally
meant
that
they
are
able
to
get
service
at
least
from
the
three
networks.
but
beyond
that
they
wouldn't
permit
it.
that
was
challenged
and
ultimately
this
court
in
southwestern
did
sustain
the
authority
of
the
commission
to
adopt
such
rules
and
regulations
because
these
rules
and
regulations
were
ancillary
to
the
commission's
authority
with
respect
to
broadcasting.
catv
systems,
the
commission
held
and
this
court
agreed,
are
engaged
in
communication
by
wire
or
radio
within
the
meaning
in
the
air.
now,
while
they
are
not
broadcast
station
themselves,
they
are
instrumentality
medium
and
in
purpose
of
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
they
because
they
are
carrying
broadcast
signals,
that's
right.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
that's
right,
they
are
really
preforming
no
different
function
in
that
respect
than
you
do
in
your
home,
when
you
put
an
antenna
on
top
of
your
roof,
you
have
a
wire
coming
down
from
the
antenna
into
your
set.
this
is
obviously
a
much
more
sophisticated
wire
but
they
were
doing
the
same
thing.
they
were
also
capturing
the
signal
on
the
antenna
and
distributing
over
a
long
wire
to
many
people.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
no
that
wasn't
even
involved
at
that
time.
quite
a
contrary,
when
this
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
to
carry
what?
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
yes,
that
was
what
was
involved
there,
the
commission
said
as
part
of
out
authority.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
the
rule
was
involved
in
that
case
that
wasn't
challenged.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
yeah
that
particular
moment
wasn't
challenged
but
in
another
case,
which
midwest
had
brought
in
the
eight
circuit
where
that
rule
was
challenged,
the
eight
circuit
did
uphold
that
regulation
and
so
it
was
not
solved.
so
the
courts
have
upheld
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
that's
the
position
we
took
several
years
ago
and
we
were
not
able
to
persuade
the
courts
that
that
was
correct.
the
reason
we
took
was
on
that
just
for
a
little
history
was
that
this
was
a
reception
service
and
the
commission
only
has
jurisdiction
over
transmission
service.
the
courts
agreed
with
the
commission
on
that,
said
you
can
adopt
rules
and
regulation
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
no,
in
this
case,
not
at
all.
not
only
it
wouldn't
invalidate
that
rule
but
it
wouldn't
invalidate
the
rules
and
regulations
that
the
commission
had
adopted
that
said
that
if
you
voluntarily
originate,
you
will
have
to
comply
with
the
fairness
doctrine,
you
have
to
comply
with
(inaudible)
law,
with
all
the
other
rules
and
regulation
with
respect
to
it.
there
are
difficult
legal
questions
i
think
that
your
honor
was
adverting
to
on
questioning
mr.
wallace
as
to
whether
there
are
not
constitutional
queasiness
about
that
because
there
is
not
at
the
same
scarcity
involved
there
but
that's
not
involved
here
and
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
well
the
state's
--
the
commission,
at
this
stage
of
the
game
is
undertaking
in
many
areas
to
pre-empt
the
theory
of
state
regulation,
the
states
are
fighting
that
and
that
matter
is
now
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
that
is
not,
the
state
illinois
has
filed
a
brief
for
amicus
in
this
court
which
they
assert
that
it
is
involved.
i
don't
think
it
is
involved
myself
and
i
don't
think
the
government
feels
that's
involved
but
the
states
at
least
see
where
it's
leading
to,
getting
into
this
problem
really.
i
don't
think
this
particular
rule
and
regulation
does
involve
the
divisions
of
authority
between
the
federal
and
state
authority
but
we
think
that
the
politics
compel
someone
to
go
into
a
business
that
he
doesn't
want
to,
the
state
will
let
that
politics
as
much
as
the
fcc
does.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
some
municipalities,
when
you
have
to
get
a
franchise
from
municipality
to
operate
a
catv
system
because
your
wires
cross
over
alleys
and
screeching,
you
have
to
get
a
franchise
from
it.
now
some
of
those
franchises
require
the
catv
operator
to
originate
problems.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
what?
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
not
automatically
because
we
think
that
what’s
involved
here
is
an
absence
of
statutory
authority
with
constitutional
overtones
but
we
don't
think
you
have
reached
a
reached
the
constitutional
problem
because
there’s
an
absence
of
statutory
authority.
but
if
the
constitutional
overtone
to
argument
is
involved,
the
same
constitutional
limitation
would
be
applicable
to
the
municipalities
or
applicable
to
federal
governments.
but
that
is
not
involved
here
because
i
think
we
don't
reach
that
because
the
commission
has
not
been
given
this
authority
by
congress,
where
the
congress
could
give
it
the
authority,
is
not
entirely
a
clear
question
and
it
would
depend
entirely
on
a
type
of
statute
that
congress
drafted,
the
type
of
findings
they
made
as
to
whether
they
could,
as
to
what
would
be
involved,
but
that's
not
involved
here.
we
think
it's
very
clear,
that
congress
has
not
given
the
fcc
authority
with
respect
to
that.
what
congress
did
give
the
commission
authority
so
far
as
reception
activities
are
concerned
is
that
you
can
adapt
rules
and
regulations,
that
are
reasonably
ancillary
to
your
regulation
of
broadcast
station.
and
for
example,
with
respect
to
your
mandatory
carriage
of
all
local
signals.
since
the
commission
in
section
3,
303(a),
and
303(h)
of
the
communication
provides
that
the
commission
has
the
authority
to
classify
radio
stations
and
to
prescribe
the
areas
to
be
served
by
them.
well,
obviously
it's
ancillary
to
that
jurisdiction
says
the
court
for
the
commission
to
require
local
catv
system
to
carry
local
signal.
because
if
they
don't,
the
area
that
the
commission
has
prescribed
for
a
broadcast
station,
is
cut-off
by
the
same
token
when
the
commission
says
that
you
shall
not
import
distant
signals
beyond
where
they
are
intended
to
be
carried.
for
example,
if
you
are
operating
a
system
that
cast
for
wyoming
and
you’re
trying
to
import
a
signal
from
denver,
colorado,
you’re
obviously
extending
that
signal
beyond
the
area
which
the
commission
had
prescribed
which
that
station
is
to
be
served.
the
commission
under
certain
circumstances
do
permit
those
signals
to
be
imported,
but
permitted
only
for
the
purpose
of
making
sure
that
the
people
in
riverton,
wyoming
have
enough
reception
services.
so
that
was
the
theory
upon
which
the
commission
upheld
authority
in
the
southwestern
case
because
it
was
reasonably
ancillary
to
broadcast
jurisdiction
over
television
station.
now
catv
system
in
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
that's
right,
that's
right.
and
this
is
why
this
does
perform
a
very
important
public
interest
function
and
when
they
do
perform
their
function,
if
there
are
engagements,
state
communication
by
wire
or
radio,
they
are
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
that
congress
has
given
to
the
commission,
to
make
sure
that
it
carries
out
to
policies
of
regulating
broadcast
stations
is
not
inconsistent
therewith.
now
a
catv
system,
in
this
essence
is
a
very,
very
simple
matter.
it
erects
an
antenna,
cables
come
down,
distribute
it
to
the
people
who
paid
$4
to
$6
a
month
for
that
service.
the
pertinent
is
relatively
simple.
the
personnel
involved
in
it
are
relatively
few
in
number
and
unsophisticated
personnel,
the
people
that
string
cables
or
maintain
cables,
will
hook
up
television
receivers
and
a
small
billing
department
that
goes
out
and
bills
the
people
$4
to
$6
a
month
and
collects
it.
now
the
commission
comes
along
and
says,
catv
operates
in
many
small
communities
that
don't
have
their
own
television
stations.
wouldn't
it
be
nice
if
those
communities
had
television
stations?
and
therefore
the
commission
said
that
if
you’re
going
to
stay
in
the
business,
since
you
are
using
broadcast
signals
--
if
you're
going
to
stay
in
the
business
of
providing
broadcast
stations,
we
want
to
know,
we
want,
we
demand
that
if
you
have
3,500
or
more
subscribers,
that
you
must
also
become
a
broadcast
station
and
that's
what
cablecasting
needs.
you
must
become
a
broadcast
station,
you
must
originate
your
own
programs.
you
must
have
facilities
available
for
local
program
and
you
must
originate
it.
now
this
is
an
entirely
a
business
activity
from
what
catv
is
involved
in.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
under
the
statute
that
congress
had
drafted,
i
say
they
do
not
have
the
statutory
authority,
that
is
correct.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
under
any
of
the
present
statute.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
under
present
statute
they
are
not.
i
should
point
out
to
your
honor
that
in
a
somewhat
related
field,
when
television
receivers
were
first
been
marketed,
they
would
be
marketed
with
vhf
channels
only,
even
though
they
were
both
vhf
and
uhf
channels,
the
television
receivers
have
been
marketed
with
vhf
channels
only
and
the
commission
–
the
television
was
not
getting
off
to
ground
so
far
as
uhf
was
concerned.
the
commission
went
to
congress,
to
get
a
statute
passed
that
says
if
you
manufacture
television
receivers
you
must
make
sure
that
they
have
all
the
channels.
the
commission
felt
the
need
of
going
to
congress
to
get
some
specific
statutory
authority,
desirable
as
the
objective
was.
they
felt
powerless
to
doing
things
without
getting
an
enactment
of
congress.
the
commission
has
similarly
gone
to
congress
in
the
area
of
catv
to
try
to
get
additional
or
supplementary
legislation
and
congress
had
not
done
anything
on
the
subject.
not
that
congress
has
approved,
congress
has
sat
back
and
is
watching
what's
happening.
but
the
need
to
go
to
the
congress
to
get
authority
in
this
field
is
very,
very
clear.
in
the
reception
field,
where
they
had
to
get
a
statute
which
section
303(s)
which
specifically
authorizes
the
commission
to
prevent
the
shipment
in
interstate
commerce
of
any
television
receiver
unless
it
carries
both
vhf
and
uhf,
so
that
the
entire
spectrum
can
be
utilized.
now,
what
the
fcc
is
telling
to
a
catv
system,
is
you
must
become
a
broadcaster.
not
only
must
you
have
this
simple
equipment
up
there
for
distributing
signals,
you
have
got
to
go
out
and
buy
cameras.
you
have
got
to
go
out
and
buy
a
microphone.
you
have
got
to
hire
people
who
creates
programs.
we
don't
create
programs
as
the
catv
system
where
a
passive
distributor
programs,
we're
really
performing
the
function
of
distributing
the
signals
that
are
dedicated
to
the
public,
we're
making
them
available
to
the
people,
that's
a
simple
dedicated
function.
we
are
not
created
people
in
the
sense
of,
of
being
able
to
create
a
program.
they
say,
we
got
to
buy
the
equipment,
the
color
--
the
television
cameras
to
project
the
images,
sophisticated
people
who
can
create
programs,
to
the
extent
that
their
copyright
programs
are
involved.
we
got
to
go
out
and
get
copyrights
on
all
those
and
even
under
fortnightly
there
is
no
doubt,
that
when
we
originate
a
program
that
involved
copyrighted
material,
we
must
get
a
copyright
license.
we
never
contended
that
we
can
do
it
without
a
copyright
license.
not
like
that,
but
we
submit
ourselves
to
a
whole
new
area
of
regulation
of
the
commission,
we
got
to
learn
about
fairness,
we
got
to
learn
about
the
equal
opportunity,
the
volumes
and
volumes
of
commission
regulations
that
they
have
adopted,
dealing
with
broadcast
that
we've
got
to
learn
about.
we're
not
challenging
that,
that
if
we
do
it
voluntarily.
but
we're
saying
this,
as
an
entirely
different
business
activity
from
what's
been
involved
in,
when
we
dedicated
our
property
really
to
being
a
catv
operator.
the
commission
now
comes
to
say,
find
your
catv
operator,
but
we
now
want
to
enter
into
an
entirely
different
business
activity
from
what
you
yourself
undertook
to
do.
that's
what's
involved
in
mandatory
origination.
the
commission
in
effect
says,
if
you're
all
okay
even
in
a
small
community,
even
if
when
there
is
no
other
television
stations
involved.
so
you're
not
having
an
impact
on,
and
if
you
have
5,000
subscribers,
important
as
your
services,
bringing
television
service
to
those
people
who
might
not
get
it
otherwise.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
yes.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
the
commission
says
to
him,
that
you
can't
operate
a
broadcast
station
without
a
license,
and
license
requires
you
to
operate
in
the
public
interest.
when
you
come
to
us
and
say,
you
want
a
station
to
operate
in
public
interest,
then
they
say,
you've
got
to
comply
with
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
only
to
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
well,
but
the
license
that
the
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
they
have
to
get
permission
from
the
commission.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
that's
what
they
are
saying,
what
we
are
saying.
but
that's
the
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
the
difference
between
the
two
situations
in
effect
they
are
saying
is,
that
if
you
want
to
carry
broadcast
signals,
you
must
become
something
additional
to
that.
you
must
become
a
broadcast
station.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
yes.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
the
innovative
question
that
mr.
justice
white
asked
and
is
really
the
novel
case
is,
as
to
what
is
the
nature
of
the
undertaking
of
the
commission's
jurisdictions.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
the
quintessence
of
the
question
that
we
use
broadcast
signal,
because
it's
an
implication,
not
only
an
implication
a
direct
statement
to
commission,
that
there
is
a
benefit
conferred
that
since
we
used
broadcast
signal.
but
basically,
this
is
not
a
parasitic
or
an
exploitation
relationship,
it's
a
symbiotic
relationship.
broadcast
signals
when
they
are
transmitted
over
the
year
are
worthless
unless
there
is
something
on
the
other
end
to
receive
and
then
making
use
of
it.
we
are
just
as
much
a
part
of
it,
not
as
a
recipient
of
the
benefit,
but
as
a
part
of
the
symbiotic
processes
as
well.
we
are
no
different
than
the
sale,
than
the
local
dealer,
that
makes
television
sets
to
make
them
available
to
the
people
so
that
they
can
receive
the
broadcast.
obviously,
if
no
one
will
make
them
broadcast,
there
would
be
no
market
facets.
but
by
the
same
token,
if
no
one
were
making
sets
there
would
be
no
purpose
in
transmitting
signals
over
the
year.
it's
a
duality
of
the
process,
to
tell
us
that
just
because
we
utilize
broadcast
signals
in
a
manner
in
which
they
are
intended
to
be
utilized,
and
in
a
manner
which
unless
we
did
something
with
them,
they
wouldn't
be
useful
at
all,
that
therefore
we
should
now
undertake
to
become
a
broadcast
station
in
effect
as
to
be
able
to
tell
the
manufacturer
of
television
receivers
or
the
sales
or
television
receiver,
since
you
are
making
use
of
broadcast
signals.
you
want
to
do
some,
you
want
to
go
in
and
open
a
broadcast
station
in
your
town.
we
are
undertaking
positive
process,
the
commission
has
certain
jurisdiction
over
one
part
of
process
and
another
type
of
jurisdiction
over
the
other
part
of
the
process,
but
no
where
has
the
congress
given
the
commission
the
power
to
say
that
if
you
do
part
of
the
process,
you
also
must
do
another
part
of
the
process.
and
this
is,
it's
like
in
the
case
of
frost
&
frost
(ph)
where
we
cited
in
effect
where
the
state
of
california
told
this
gentleman
if
you
want
to
use
our
road,
you've
got
to
be
not
just
a
private
contractor
for
hire,
you
must
be
a
common
carrier
for
hire.
and
the
supreme
court
said,
no,
you
can
make
reasonable
regulations
relating
to
the
use
of
the
road,
and
you
may
have
even
forbid
the
use
of
the
road,
but
you
can't
say
that
if
you
utilized
the
road,
you
can
at
the
same
time,
say
now
since
you
are
utilizing
the
road,
you
have
become
a
common
carrier
even
though
that's
not
what
you
intended
to
dedicate
your
property
to.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
what
i
am
saying
--
that's
what
they
are
trying
to
say,
and
i
am
not
saying
that
it's
an
un-worthy
thing
that
they
are
trying
to
do,
but
in
effect
they
are
telling
us
who
only
want
to
be
--
to
manufacture
and
install
receivers
or
to
install
receivers
since
we
are
performing
that
function,
we
ought
to
do
something
else.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
that's
right.
now
if
congress
had
said
that
this
whole
business
of
installing,
as
a
new
business
okay,
that
if
you
install
and
so
forth,
that
as
part
of
that,
there
ought
to
be
certain
responsibilities
to
it,
that
could
be
another
matter.
but
so
far
as
our
function
is
concerned,
and
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
fortnightly,
true
from
a
copyright
point
of
view,
what
we
do
is
perform
the
reception
part
of
this,
and
not
the
transmission
part.
it's
an
entirely
different
activity
that
they
are
asking
us
to
do,
it's
not
like
the
broadcast
station,
when
a
man
who
enters
into
operating
a
broadcast
station
must
operate
in
the
public
interest.
but
at
the
same
--
what
they
can
do
the
analogy
is
–
they
say,
if
you
got
to
be
a
catv
system,
you
got
to
be
a
catv
system
which
means
you
got
to
carry
the
local
signals,
means
you
got
to
carry
them
in
such
a
way
as
not
to
degrade
them,
that
you
must
meet
certain
technical
standards
in
your
operation
of
a
catv
function.
we
have
no
problem,
that's
the
business
where
in
it's
legitimate
and
severable
business,
and
the
commission
can
lay
down
rules
and
regulations
that
if
we
enter
the
catv
business
we
must
do
it,
in
appropriate
manner,
and
that's
what
southwestern
was
all
about.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
in
the
public
interest
related
to
the
reception
functions,
and
there
is
ancillary
to
the
broadcast
function.
i
don't
see
how
it's
ancillary
to
the
broadcast
function
to
tell
us
that
we
must
become
a
broadcast
station
in
effect
in
a
way
that
might
yield
benefits
to
the
public.
but
it
does
not
help
the
broadcast
stations
in
any
event
to
have
us
become
a
competitor
by
originating
problems.
the
whole
theory
of
regulation,
even
in
a
broadcast
field,
those
of
us
who
come
from
small
towns
who
don't
have
any
broadcast
stations
--
we'd
love
to
have
had
broadcast
station.
the
commission
has
never
had
the
power
to
say
to
someone
that
you've
got
to
go
in,
and
operate
the
broadcast
station
in
that
particular
town.
they
will
say,
if
you
want
to
operate
a
station
in
that
town,
you
have
got
to
live
up
to
certain
rules
and
regulation.
but
the
affirmative
requirement
that
tells
someone
that
he
must
operate
a
broadcast
station
is
really
what's
involved
here.
that's
imposing
a
duty
on
difference
of
time,
not
just
of
decree,
not
just
a
definition.
they
can
tell
us
how
to
operate
a
catv
business,
the
quintessence
of
a
catv
system.
but
when
they
say
beyond
that,
you
now
must
undertake
to
operate
in
addition,
a
broadcast
station.
the
correlative
of
this
would
be,
when
in
the
area
before
there
was
an
old
channel
law
that
is
to
say,
when
people
were
operating
either
vhf
or
uhf
television
stations
and
the
commission
said,
television
is
not
getting
its
maximum
potential
for
the
simple
reason
that
there
aren't
enough
either
cheap
receivers
out
or
there
aren't
enough
receivers
outstanding
that
are
capable
of
receiving
uhf
and
therefore
as
a
condition
of
operating
your
television
station,
we
insist
that
you
go
into
the
manufacturing
business
and
manufacturer
receivers,
so
that
people
around
to
be
able
to
receive
those
signals.
and
not
only
didn't
the
commission
undertake
to
do
that
with
respect
to
broadcast
as
i
mentioned
earlier
even
with
respect
to
manufacture,
to
manufacturing
receivers
it
took
a
specific
enactment
of
congress
to
enable
the
commission
to
be
able
to
tell
the
manufactures
that
in
order
to
engage
in
this
business
your
receiver
must
carry
all
channels,
and
not
just
the
channels
that
you
want
to
put
on.
when
the
commission
adopted
these
rules
and
regulations
which
says
that
you
can't
have
the
luxury
of
carrying
only
distant
signal
that
if
you
got
to
be
a
catv
system,
you
must
carry
local
signal.
that
was
enabling
them
to
regulate
the
business
that
we
have
gone
into
perform
and
a
recipient
function.
if
they
say
that
the
signal
must
have
a
certain
quality
to
make
sure
that
the
public
gets
the
same
quality
of
signal
on
their
set
that's
been
transmitted
by
the
station.
that
also
is
part
of
it.
but
to
say
in
addition,
that
we
must
become
a
broadcast
station
is
in
effect
--
the
analogy
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
like
the
distributor
of
the
new
york
times
in
washington
for
example,
is
performing
a
function,
he
is
taking
advantage
of
newspaper
function.
if
some
local
authority
said
that
in
return
for
that
privilege,
we
don't
think
there
is
enough
local
newspapers
in
town,
we
think
that
you
ought
to
publish
a
local
newspaper.
this
is
what
the
commission
is
doing.
we
are
not
arguing
with
the
desirability
of
the
function.
what
we
are
saying
is
under
our
system
of
regulation
that
this
volition
that
goes
into
business,
that
you
cannot
be
compelled
to
dedicate
your
property
to
a
business
that
you
don't
use.
that
you
--
that
when
you
enter
a
business
you
are
subject
to
rules
and
regulations,
and
if
we
voluntarily
originate
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
we
can't
originate
and
fail
to
comply
with
the
same
fairness,
equal
opportunity
(inaudible)
law
that
does
a
broadcast
station.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
that's
correct.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
that's
right.
it
is,
and
that's
why
i
am
saying,
we
are
not
arguing
whether
it's
reasonable.
now,
we
are
not
arguing
that
the
length
should
be
3,500
or
6,000
or
10,000,
we
are
not
arguing
on
that.
but
what
we
are
arguing
is
it's
not
within
the
statutory
jurisdiction
to
compel
us
to
do
this.
i
do
want
to
mention
one
further
fact
it's
not
crucial
to
the
case,
but
mr.
justice
douglas
had
asked
whether
there
are
any
grandfather
rights
with
respect
to
this.
the
grandfather
right
is
not
applicable
here,
this
is
applicable
all
catv
system
no
matter
when
they
started.
the
grandfather
rights
that
the
commission
had
recognized
in
this
field,
pertained
to
the
situation
that
you
are
permitted
to
continue
to
carry
the
broadcast
signal
that
you
did
before.
but
no
grandfather
protection
has
been
recorded
in
this
thing.
we
don't
think
that's
crucial
because
we
think
the
statutory
jurisdiction
is
lacking
for
new
system
as
well
as
old
system.
but
i
didn't
want
the
record
to
be
vague
on
that
point.
in
summary,
the
position
that
we
have
taken
is
that
as
a
matter
of
statutory
authority,
the
commission
is
authorized
to
regulate
broadcast
station.
they
are
authorized
to
regulate
catv
system
only
to
the
extent
that's
reasonably
ancillary
to
broadcast
function,
and
that
relates
to
the
type
of
rules
and
regulation
as
to
carry
the
broadcast
signals.
we
do
not
argue
because
it's
not
involved
as
to
whether
if
we
undertake
voluntary
origination
that
we
are
not
subject
to
the
same
rules
and
regulation,
as
are
applicable
to
broadcast
station
that
is
not
before
the
court,
we
are
not
contesting
insofar
as
this
record
is
concerned.
we
do
say
though
that
we
cannot
be
compelled
to
enter
into
a
brand
new
and
entirely
different
kind
of
business
as
a
condition
of
performing
the
function,
or
making
the
signals
available
that
are
dedicated
to
the
public,
by
taking
those
signals
and
putting
them
to
the
use
for
which
the
dedication
was
contemplated.
