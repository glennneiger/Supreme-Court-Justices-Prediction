mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
upon
the
challenge
of
the
respondent,
which
is
an
operator
of
cable
television
systems
in
missouri,
new
mexico
and
texas,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
held
invalid,
a
rule
of
the
federal
communications
commission,
which
provides
that
a
cable
television
system
having
3,500
or
more
subscribers
may
not
in
the
absence
of
waiver
of
the
rule
by
the
commission,
which
is
not
stated
in
the
rule
but
it
had
become
clear
in
subsequent
reports,
may
not
distribute
the
signals
of
television
broadcast
stations
unless
it
“also
operates
to
a
significant
extent
as
a
local
outlet
by
cablecasting”
and
by
having
available
“facilities
for
local
production
and
presentation
of
programs,
other
than
automated
services”.
the
cablecasting
simply
means
the
providing
of
programming
on
the
system,
without
the
use
of
broadcast
signals.
most
cable
television
service
does
originate
as
broadcast
programming
of
the
system
that
brings
in
through
its
antennas.
cablecasting
would
be
programming
that
it
provides
itself,
rather
than
from
broadcast
services.
the
background
of
the
rule
is
this.
in
june
of
1968,
this
court
in
the
south
western
cable
company
decision
in
392
us
upheld
the
fcc’s
authority
to
stay
cable
transmission
of
distant
broadcast
signals
into
a
community
pending
a
hearing.
the
situation
there
involving
the
100
largest
television
markets.
the
court
held
in
that
case
that
cable
television
systems
engage
in
interstate
communication
by
wire
or
radio
within
the
meaning
of
section
2(a)
of
the
communications
act
and
that
the
systems
are
therefore
subject
to
the
commission’s
regulatory
jurisdiction
at
least
to
the
extent,
that
the
commission's
regulation
is
reasonably
ancillary
in
the
words
of
the
court
to
the
effect
of
performance
of
the
commission's
various
responsibilities
for
the
regulation
of
television
broadcasting.
with
uncertainties
about
the
commission’s
jurisdiction
in
regulatory
authority
over
cable
television
thus
dispelled
at
least
to
this
extent,
which
i
will
argue
as
basically
all
we
need
here.
the
commission
has
undertaken
a
major
effort
to
integrate
the
rapidly
burgeoning
cable
systems
into
the
national
communication
systems
in
ways
that
will
be
consistent
with
and
in
furtherance
of
the
public
interest
policy
objectives
of
the
communications
act.
since
the
decision
in
south
western,
the
commission
has
so
far
devoted
more
than
three
years
of
intensive
study
to
cable
television.
in
a
series
of
rulemaking
proceedings,
which
began
in
december
of
1968
with
the
notice
of
rulemaking,
reprinted
in
the
appendix,
which
resolved
and
the
rule
is
at
issue
here.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
nothing
in
the
act
on
that
subject.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
needn't
reach
that
issue
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
act
on
that
subject,
it
would
still
be
communication
by
wire,
there
might
be
interstate
aspects
to
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
it
does.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
under
southwestern,
we
don't
think
that
that's
limited
to
common
carriers
but
this
case
no
more
in
a
southwestern
requires
the
court
to
reach
that
issue.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
presumably,
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
decided
the
case
differently.
i
agree,
your
honor,
but
i
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
undoubtedly.
if
the
act
as
you
know,
was
enacted
in
1934
and
has
not
been
amended
on
this
subject.
the
commission
is
proceeding
as
best
it
can.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
at
all,
your
honor.
in
southwestern
cable,
the
court
reviewed
the
attempts
to
amend
the
act
that
up
to
that
time
had
occurred
in
congress
and
noted
that
none
of
them
had
resulted
in
the
adoption
of
any
legislation,
and
since
that
time,
there
has
not
even
been
a
bill
considered
in
committee
on
this
subject
since
the
southwestern
decision.
but
we
think
there
is
some
significance
in
the
close
scrutiny
that
congress
has
been
giving
to
the
development
of
the
commission's
rulemaking
proceedings
in
this
subject.
the
commission
has
submitted
several
written
reports
to
congress
on
its
cable
television
rulemaking
endeavors
during
the
periods
in
southwestern
to
the
requisite
congressional
committees,
mostly
the
communication,
subcommittees
of
the
two
commerce
committees.
and
members
of
the
commission
have
at
times
been
quite
closely
questioned
about
these
efforts
at
committee
hearings
and
while
this
is
certainly
not
dispositive
of
the
case,
we
believe
that
it's
significant
because
of
this
close
scrutiny
that
there
has
so
far
been
no
substantial
indication
of
any
congressional
dissatisfaction
with
the
way
the
commission
has
been
performing
its
task
in
this
area.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
commission
has
devoted
a
great
deal
of
time
and
effort
to
that
covering
various
subjects
in
the
course
of
these
rulemaking
proceedings.
i
can
broadly
characterize
them
as
the
carriage
of
television
broadcast
signals
by
cable
systems
and
the
use
of
cable
television
channels
for
the
distribution
of
non-broadcast
programming,
the
main
one
at
issue
here.
but
also
a
minimum
technical
standards
for
cable
television
systems,
including
minimum
channel
requirements,
two-way
transmission
capability
and
separate
neighborhood
program
origination
centers
and
the
whole
question
of
the
appropriate
distribution
of
regulatory
jurisdiction
between
federal
and
state
and
local
levels
of
government,
and
question
of
limitation
on
local
franchise
fees
paid
by
cable
systems.
in
the
course
of
these
proceedings
over
the
past
three
years,
more
than
700
comments
have
been
received
from
various
industries,
civic
and
academic
groups
and
there
were
two
lengthy
realms
of
oral
presentations
and
panel
discussions
held
by
the
commission
involving
more
than
200
participants.
one
round
in
february
1969,
before
the
orders
at
issue
here
were
adopted
and
another
realm
in
march
of
1971,
all
together
ten
full
days
were
spent
on
these
hearings
of
panel
discussions,
and
following
the
1971
consideration,
the
commission
in
february
of
1972
adopted
a
much
more
comprehensive
set
of
rules
on
this
subject
than
the
rules
at
issue
here.
we
have
lodged
ten
copies
of
these
with
the
court
in
this
case.
and
in
addition
to
the
reference
materials
that
are
cited
in
the
briefs
on
the
subject,
there
is
a
very
lengthy
and
comprehensive
article
on
the
subject
coming
out
in
the
forthcoming
issue,
the
april
issue
of
the
notre
dame
lawyer
which
should
be
brought
to
the
court's
attention.
it's
an
article
by
professor
steven
barnett
of
the
university
of
california
law
school
which
discusses
very
comprehensively
the
new
rules
and
also
the
issues
involved
in
the
question
of
the
commission's
jurisdiction.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
sir.
you'll
find
after
the
initial
part
of
it
which
is
the
report
and
order
discussing
them
on
page
3278.
you
have
it
with
you
there.
there's
an
index
to
the
rules
themselves
which
gives
you
some
idea
of
the
scope
of
it.
it
might
have
been.
while
professor
barnett
does
take
issue
on
policy
grounds
with
some
of
the
conclusions
the
commission
has
reached,
he
does
say
that
his
view
--
there
is
jurisdiction.
now
the
1969
rules
challenged
in
this
case,
have
three
general
aspects.
you
get
back
to
the
rules
at
issue
here.
and
these
were
summarized
--
this
case
is
only
under
the
1969
rules
which
had
three
general
aspects
summarized
in
commissioner
bartley's
concurring
state,
concurring
statement
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
rules,
that
is
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
great
covered
petition.
on
pages
55
and
56,
at
the
bottom
of
page
55
commissioner
bartley
very
briefly
summarized
what
was
involved
in
the
rules
that
were
challenged
in
this
case.
one
is
the
provision
that
a
cable
system
may
originate
programs
without
limitation
as
to
number
of
channels.
and
beginning
on
january
1,
any
system
with
3,500
or
more
subscribers
is
required
to
originate
programs
to
a
significant
extent
or
else
it's
just
forbidden
to
carry
broadcasting.
and
then
his
b
and
c
applied
to
the
program
originated,
the
cablecasting
programs.
one
was
provisions
that
they
may
sell
advertising
with
respect
to
such
programs
to
be
presented
only
at
natural
breaks
or
intermissions
in
the
programs,
and
c
is
that
this
programming
that
they
originate
this
cablecasting
is
required
generally
to
comply
with
the
equal
opportunity
and
fairness
doctrine
provisions
and
sponsorship
identification
provisions
of
the
communications
act
and
of
the
rules.
the
respondent
here
challenged
all
three
aspects,
that
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
program
origination
requirement
is
invalid
and
then
refused
to
pass
on
the
validity
of
the
remaining
rules
on
the
ground
that
the
respondent
lacks
standing
to
challenge
them
since
it
did
not
intend
to
originate
any
programming,
once
the
programming
requirement,
the
origination
requirement
was
struck
down.
so
the
only
question
before
this
court
is
the
validity
of
the
origination
or
cablecasting
requirement.
the
respondent
correctly
points
out
that
no
cablecasting
was
involved
in
the
southwestern
case.
and
i
have
already
mentioned
that
the
rule
at
issue
here
applies
only
to
systems
that
carry
broadcast
signals,
not
to
the
presently
nonexistent
possibility
of
a
system
that
does
nothing
but
cablecasting.
so
there
is
no
need
for
the
court
in
this
case
to
reach
any
question
of
the
commission's
jurisdiction
over
cablecasting
as
it
stands
alone.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
a
programming
over
the
cable
that
does
not
involve
any
broadcast
signals
or
any
broadcast
originating
program.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
wholly
originated
by
the
cablecaster
although
it
may
not
necessarily
be
local
programming,
there
can
be
programming
that
supply
to
him
from
elsewhere,
including
networking
possibilities
here,
but
it
would
not
be
programming
that
originates
through
radio
signals
that
are
being
broadcast
to
other
viewers.
it
could
be
programming
that
is
sent
to
him
by
radio
signals
that
are
not
really
broadcast
signals.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
a
possibility.
the
rule
contemplates
that
some
of
this
origination
requirement
could
be
met
by
networking
or
other
interconnected
programming,
although
there
is
a
requirement
that
there
be
local
facilities
available
but
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
there
is
also
the
possibility
of
this
networking
including
the
use
of
satellites,
which
has
been
discussed
in
the
course
of
these
rulemaking
proceedings
as
a
possible
way
of
networking
cablecasting.
it's
not
the
primary
purpose
of
the
rule,
but
a
substantial
part
of
the
cable
systems
obligations
could
be
fulfilled
by
use
of
these
services,
and
it's
one
consideration
that
we
think
should
be
taken
into
account
with
respect
to
the
commission's
authority
here
although
it's
not
the
basic,
the
heart
of
the
commission's
rationale
here.
all
of
the
programs
whether
broadcast
originated
or
not,
are
supplied
by
cable
systems
as
they
exist
today
to
their
subscribers
over
the
same
cable,
and
from
the
standpoint
of
the
viewer
turning
the
dial
from
one
channel
to
another,
cablecasting
offered
by
the
system
is
for
all
practical
purposes
undifferentiated
from
the
other
services
being
offered,
and
indeed
from
broadcast
services
that
he
receives.
for
this
reason,
we
think
it
fairly
clear
that
under
the
ancillary
standard,
reasonably
ancillary
standard
of
southwestern
cable,
the
commission
must
have
some
authority
to
regulate
cablecasting
service
because
if
the
system
were
free
to
ignore
its
cablecasting,
the
fairness,
equal
opportunities,
sponsorship
identification
requirements,
that
otherwise
exist
on
the
set,
their
overall
effect
would
be
quite
seriously
undermined
and
there
is
also
the
problem
of
the
possible
use
of
pay
cablecasting.
this
would
be
a
per
program
or
per
service
fee
rather
than
just
the
subscription
for
hooking
in
to
the
cable,
and
the
concerns
of
the
commission
has
had
about
the
siphoning
off
through
pay
television
of
programming
that
is
now
available
free
to
viewers.
it
could
very
well
be
undermined,
if
pay
cablecasting
could
come
in,
and
perform
the
same
siphoning
off
of
programming
and
the
commission
were
powerless
to
regulate.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
not
not
that
kind
but
i
am
talking
about
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
there
is
a
subscription
fee.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
that
sense,
but
now
i
am
talking
about
the
additional
element
of
a
per
service
or
a
per
program
fee
that
you
can't
get
the
particular
program
unless
you
pay
a
particular
fee
for
it,
such
as
we
have
with
pay
broadcast
television.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
advertising
it
--
there
isn't,
with
respect
to
the
broadcast
programming
that
is
carried.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
there
--
it
is
now
--
they
can
carry
the
advertising
that
is
already
put
on
the
air
by
the
broadcast.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
as
it
is,
and
they
don't
interfere
with
the
advertising
that
is
on
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
in
their
cablecasting
operations,
the
commission
has
authorized
them
to
introduce
advertising,
but
only
at
natural
breaks
in
the
programming.
they
are
not
authorized
to
interrupt
the
programming,
and
those
systems
that
are
now
engaging
in
cablecasting
do
have
advertising
from
the
originated
program.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
all
do
operate
with
subscriber's
fees.
of
course,
to
the
extent
that
their
programming
cost
can
be
defrayed
through
advertising
there
than
able
to
reduce
subscription
fees,
and
the
commission
considers
these
matters
and
decided
to
authorize
advertising
to
that
limited
extent
with
cablecasting.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
they
have
the
option
to
carry
it
just
as
broadcasting.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
nothing
to
stop
them
if
they
choose
to
limit
their
advertising
that
way,
they
do
have
the
fairness
doctrine
requirements
and
the
equal
opportunities
requirements
to
comply
with,
and
in
the
commission's
view,
and
not
in
the
commission's
rule,
if
the
commission
has
authority
to
apply
them.
and
of
course
we
contend
that
they
do,
but
the
question
here
is
whether
the
commission
had
authority
to
apply
the
origination
requirement
to
cablecasters,
to
cable
systems
that
would
prefer
not
to
do
any
cablecasting,
that
is
the
issue
here,
and
while
we
do
not
concede
that
the
reasonably
ancillary
standard
of
southwestern
sets
the
outer
limit
of
the
commission's
authority
with
respect
to
cable
television.
our
position
is
that
that
standard
is
met
with
respect
to
the
origination
requirement
also,
which
brings
me
now
to
the
rationale
of
the
commission
which
is
at
the
heart
of
this
requirement
that
they
have
imposed.
this
court
in
southwestern
recognize
the
legitimacy
of
the
commission's
concern
that
local
broadcast
service
not
be
destroyed
or
foreclosed
by
unregulated
importation
of
distant
broadcast
signals
on
cable
systems.
and
there
are
two
reasons
for
this
concern.
one
is
the
importance
to
the
public
of
programming
the
deals
with
local
issues
of
public
importance
which
can
only
reasonably
be
anticipated
on
local
service,
and
the
other
reason
is
the
very
practical
problem
that
cable
systems
do
not
serve
many
persons
in
their
area
who
are
served
by
local
broadcasting.
both
because
some
of
these
persons
cannot
or
will
not
pay
the
subscription
fees,
and
because
it
is
prohibitively
expensive
to
extend
the
cable
to
those
who
are
in
rural
areas
or
other
sparsely
populated
areas.
the
development
of
cablecasting
on
these
cable
systems
however
offers
in
the
commission's
view,
compensating
opportunities
for
service
to
the
community
that
cannot
otherwise
be
made
available
both
because
it
overcomes
the
physical
limitations
of
the
broadcast
spectrum
on
program
diversity
and
because
it
offers
new
possibilities
for
specialized
local
service.
for
example,
if
you
have
a
system
that
brings
new
york
city
signals
into
a
small
community
in
pennsylvania
as
we
do
or
you
could
just
as
well
use
a
system
bringing
denver
signals
into
small
communities
in
colorado
or
in
wyoming
as
we
have.
you
have
an
illustration
of
the
sort
of
thing
that
i
mean.
it
may
be
that
the
ability
of
the
local
broadcasters
to
continue
serving
this
small
community
and
other
small
communities
in
the
area
will
be
threatened
by
the
importation
of
these
signals.
and
perhaps
other
communities
will
also
have
their
own
cable
systems.
but
it
is
also
true
that
the
cable
system
which
now
they
have
up
to
20
channels
on
the
cable
and
provide
many
services
to
the
subscribers
in
this
local
community
that
really
can't
as
a
practical
matter
be
performed
by
broadcasters.
because
they
serve
only
a
very
local
community.
it’s
quite
possible
for
the
two
candidates
for
mayor
to
have
a
debate
on
one
of
the
cable
casting
channels
or
a
panel
discussion
to
be
held
on
a
local
school
board
problems
or
other
matters
of
particular
local
concern.
it’s
even
possible
for
small
merchants
who
want
only
a
local
audience
to
advertise
to.
to
have
available
to
them
facilities
that
really
are
not
available
through
broadcasting.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
are
some
grandfather
provisions
involved.
but
they
are
not
at
issue
in
the
present
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
our
submission
is
that
the
power
derives
basically
from
the
fact
that
these
systems
do
use
broadcast
signals.
and
what
the
commission
has
concluded
here
is
that
the
impairment
or
the
threat,
the
possible
threat
here
to
television
service
that
results
from
the
commission’s
authorization
of
the
use
of
the
radio
signals
is
the
sustenance
of
these
systems
is
offset.
it’s
sufficiently
compensated
for
by
the
news
services
to
the
community
that
cable
casting
can
provide.
so
that
it’s
only
in
light
of
both
aspects
of
the
operation
that
the
commission
is
willing
to
go
ahead
and
authorize
the
services
to
the
extent
they
have
to
use
radio
signals.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
only
would
i
say
but
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
commission's
rule
does
apply
in
that
case.
it’s
largely
because
of
the
impact
on
the
viewer
to
him
the
differentiation
of
whether
it’s
coming
in
his
cable
casting
or
his
broadcasting
is
not
all
that
apparent
as
he
flips
from
one
station
to
another.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
rather
commission
and
if
the
fairness
doctrine
is
to
operate
effectively
or
if
the
equal
opportunities
provision
had
to
operate
effectively
but
what
is
the
commission
to
do,
if
the
cablecasting
is
all
going
to
feature
people
from
one
party.
should
the
commission
then
say
that
in
compensation
for
that
the
broadcasters
must
wait
their
presentations
in
favor
of
the
other
party.
it
seems
that
the
commission
has
the
idea
is
to
get
an
overall
effect
that’s
fair
through
the
television
set.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
commission
has
not
attempted
to
apply
that
far
and
that
would
present
a
much
more
difficult
question.
but
at
least
the
viewer
there
would
tend
to
be
more
aware
that
he's
listening
only
to
someone
who
is
coming
in
with
a
cable
casting
operation.
as
it
is
now,
it
is
served
by
a
single
cable
that
presents
a
mixture
of
broadcast
originated
programming
where
these
protections
apply.
and
the
other
is
not
very
aware
of
which
he's
getting
at
any
given
moment.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
it
has
relevance
in
this
respect.
of
course,
it
only
decided
whether
there
is
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
it
does
indicate
that
--
it
seems
to
me,
it
goes
somewhat
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
commission's
rule
and
i
am
obviously
not
going
to
have
time
to
discuss
that
issue
at
any
length.
i
think
it's
well-developed
in
the
course
of
the
appendix
here.
the
considerations
that
the
commission
gave
to
financial
arguments
resulting
ultimately
in
the
waiver
that
they
provided.
but
the
fact
is
broadcasters
who
do
have
to
pay
for
networking
and
other
programs
that
they
receive.
and
who
do
not
receive
any
fees
from
their
subscribes
are
all
required
by
the
commission
to
provide
local
service
of
a
public
interest
nature.
and
when
it
comes
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
rule,
what
the
commission
has
done
here
is
to
say
that
cablecasters
now
have
the
capacity
to
provide
additional
kinds
of
local
service
that
are
not
available
through
broadcasting.
should
be
required
to
do
the
same
sort
of
thing
when
they
have
the
financial
capacity
to
do
so
and
the
commission
has
been
very
cautious
on
the
question
of
the
financial
capacity
rather
than
just
exist
in
a
parasitic
relationship
to
broadcasting.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
it
was
developed
in
the
course
of
very
lengthy
considerations
here
that
i
rehearsed
quite
a
bit
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
and
if
i
may
just
refer
you
to
the
relevant
pages.
first
is
pages
38
through
45
of
the
appendix
in
which
the
commission
originally
arrived
at
that
figure
on
the
basis
of
detailed
information
that
was
submitted
to
it.
and
especially
noting
that
more
than
70%
of
the
cablecasters
now
in
existence
now
cablecasting,
have
less
than
3,500
subscribers.
and
also
in
light
of
the
flexibility
of
their
rules,
they're
not
required
in
order
to
meet
this
rule
to
engage
in
a
high
cost
operation.
the
chart
on
page
40
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
indicates
that
it's
possible
to
get
down
to
what's
called
a
small
monochrome
system
or
minimum
monochrome
system
that
is
much
less
costly
for
those
who
don't
really
have
the
financial
resources
to
do
better.
and
then
if
i
may
add
references
to
pages
58
and
59,
where
the
commission
considered
this
further
upon
motions
for
reconsideration.
and
then
finally,
pages
66
and
67
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
in
which
the
commission
setup
procedures
for
waiver
and
said
that
any
system
with
less
than
10,000
subscribers
when
it
applies
for
a
waiver,
will
get
an
automatic
stay
until
the
waiver
situation
is
clarified,
until
the
waiver
decision
is
made.
the
commission
has
been
very
cautious
on
the
question
of
financial
capacity
and
burden
here.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
i
may
say
so,
your
honor,
it
reads
to
me
like
a
dissenting
opinion
of
the
commissioner
to
this
report
in
order
rather
than
an
opinion
on
review.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you
sir.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
upon
the
challenge
of
the
respondent,
which
is
an
operator
of
cable
television
systems
in
missouri,
new
mexico
and
texas,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
held
invalid,
a
rule
of
the
federal
communications
commission,
which
provides
that
a
cable
television
system
having
3,500
or
more
subscribers
may
not
in
the
absence
of
waiver
of
the
rule
by
the
commission,
which
is
not
stated
in
the
rule
but
it
had
become
clear
in
subsequent
reports,
may
not
distribute
the
signals
of
television
broadcast
stations
unless
it
“also
operates
to
a
significant
extent
as
a
local
outlet
by
cablecasting”
and
by
having
available
“facilities
for
local
production
and
presentation
of
programs,
other
than
automated
services”.
the
cablecasting
simply
means
the
providing
of
programming
on
the
system,
without
the
use
of
broadcast
signals.
most
cable
television
service
does
originate
as
broadcast
programming
of
the
system
that
brings
in
through
its
antennas.
cablecasting
would
be
programming
that
it
provides
itself,
rather
than
from
broadcast
services.
the
background
of
the
rule
is
this.
in
june
of
1968,
this
court
in
the
south
western
cable
company
decision
in
392
us
upheld
the
fcc’s
authority
to
stay
cable
transmission
of
distant
broadcast
signals
into
a
community
pending
a
hearing.
the
situation
there
involving
the
100
largest
television
markets.
the
court
held
in
that
case
that
cable
television
systems
engage
in
interstate
communication
by
wire
or
radio
within
the
meaning
of
section
2(a)
of
the
communications
act
and
that
the
systems
are
therefore
subject
to
the
commission’s
regulatory
jurisdiction
at
least
to
the
extent,
that
the
commission's
regulation
is
reasonably
ancillary
in
the
words
of
the
court
to
the
effect
of
performance
of
the
commission's
various
responsibilities
for
the
regulation
of
television
broadcasting.
with
uncertainties
about
the
commission’s
jurisdiction
in
regulatory
authority
over
cable
television
thus
dispelled
at
least
to
this
extent,
which
i
will
argue
as
basically
all
we
need
here.
the
commission
has
undertaken
a
major
effort
to
integrate
the
rapidly
burgeoning
cable
systems
into
the
national
communication
systems
in
ways
that
will
be
consistent
with
and
in
furtherance
of
the
public
interest
policy
objectives
of
the
communications
act.
since
the
decision
in
south
western,
the
commission
has
so
far
devoted
more
than
three
years
of
intensive
study
to
cable
television.
in
a
series
of
rulemaking
proceedings,
which
began
in
december
of
1968
with
the
notice
of
rulemaking,
reprinted
in
the
appendix,
which
resolved
and
the
rule
is
at
issue
here.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
nothing
in
the
act
on
that
subject.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
needn't
reach
that
issue
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
act
on
that
subject,
it
would
still
be
communication
by
wire,
there
might
be
interstate
aspects
to
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
it
does.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
under
southwestern,
we
don't
think
that
that's
limited
to
common
carriers
but
this
case
no
more
in
a
southwestern
requires
the
court
to
reach
that
issue.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
presumably,
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
decided
the
case
differently.
i
agree,
your
honor,
but
i
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
undoubtedly.
if
the
act
as
you
know,
was
enacted
in
1934
and
has
not
been
amended
on
this
subject.
the
commission
is
proceeding
as
best
it
can.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
at
all,
your
honor.
in
southwestern
cable,
the
court
reviewed
the
attempts
to
amend
the
act
that
up
to
that
time
had
occurred
in
congress
and
noted
that
none
of
them
had
resulted
in
the
adoption
of
any
legislation,
and
since
that
time,
there
has
not
even
been
a
bill
considered
in
committee
on
this
subject
since
the
southwestern
decision.
but
we
think
there
is
some
significance
in
the
close
scrutiny
that
congress
has
been
giving
to
the
development
of
the
commission's
rulemaking
proceedings
in
this
subject.
the
commission
has
submitted
several
written
reports
to
congress
on
its
cable
television
rulemaking
endeavors
during
the
periods
in
southwestern
to
the
requisite
congressional
committees,
mostly
the
communication,
subcommittees
of
the
two
commerce
committees.
and
members
of
the
commission
have
at
times
been
quite
closely
questioned
about
these
efforts
at
committee
hearings
and
while
this
is
certainly
not
dispositive
of
the
case,
we
believe
that
it's
significant
because
of
this
close
scrutiny
that
there
has
so
far
been
no
substantial
indication
of
any
congressional
dissatisfaction
with
the
way
the
commission
has
been
performing
its
task
in
this
area.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
commission
has
devoted
a
great
deal
of
time
and
effort
to
that
covering
various
subjects
in
the
course
of
these
rulemaking
proceedings.
i
can
broadly
characterize
them
as
the
carriage
of
television
broadcast
signals
by
cable
systems
and
the
use
of
cable
television
channels
for
the
distribution
of
non-broadcast
programming,
the
main
one
at
issue
here.
but
also
a
minimum
technical
standards
for
cable
television
systems,
including
minimum
channel
requirements,
two-way
transmission
capability
and
separate
neighborhood
program
origination
centers
and
the
whole
question
of
the
appropriate
distribution
of
regulatory
jurisdiction
between
federal
and
state
and
local
levels
of
government,
and
question
of
limitation
on
local
franchise
fees
paid
by
cable
systems.
in
the
course
of
these
proceedings
over
the
past
three
years,
more
than
700
comments
have
been
received
from
various
industries,
civic
and
academic
groups
and
there
were
two
lengthy
realms
of
oral
presentations
and
panel
discussions
held
by
the
commission
involving
more
than
200
participants.
one
round
in
february
1969,
before
the
orders
at
issue
here
were
adopted
and
another
realm
in
march
of
1971,
all
together
ten
full
days
were
spent
on
these
hearings
of
panel
discussions,
and
following
the
1971
consideration,
the
commission
in
february
of
1972
adopted
a
much
more
comprehensive
set
of
rules
on
this
subject
than
the
rules
at
issue
here.
we
have
lodged
ten
copies
of
these
with
the
court
in
this
case.
and
in
addition
to
the
reference
materials
that
are
cited
in
the
briefs
on
the
subject,
there
is
a
very
lengthy
and
comprehensive
article
on
the
subject
coming
out
in
the
forthcoming
issue,
the
april
issue
of
the
notre
dame
lawyer
which
should
be
brought
to
the
court's
attention.
it's
an
article
by
professor
steven
barnett
of
the
university
of
california
law
school
which
discusses
very
comprehensively
the
new
rules
and
also
the
issues
involved
in
the
question
of
the
commission's
jurisdiction.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
sir.
you'll
find
after
the
initial
part
of
it
which
is
the
report
and
order
discussing
them
on
page
3278.
you
have
it
with
you
there.
there's
an
index
to
the
rules
themselves
which
gives
you
some
idea
of
the
scope
of
it.
it
might
have
been.
while
professor
barnett
does
take
issue
on
policy
grounds
with
some
of
the
conclusions
the
commission
has
reached,
he
does
say
that
his
view
--
there
is
jurisdiction.
now
the
1969
rules
challenged
in
this
case,
have
three
general
aspects.
you
get
back
to
the
rules
at
issue
here.
and
these
were
summarized
--
this
case
is
only
under
the
1969
rules
which
had
three
general
aspects
summarized
in
commissioner
bartley's
concurring
state,
concurring
statement
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
rules,
that
is
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
great
covered
petition.
on
pages
55
and
56,
at
the
bottom
of
page
55
commissioner
bartley
very
briefly
summarized
what
was
involved
in
the
rules
that
were
challenged
in
this
case.
one
is
the
provision
that
a
cable
system
may
originate
programs
without
limitation
as
to
number
of
channels.
and
beginning
on
january
1,
any
system
with
3,500
or
more
subscribers
is
required
to
originate
programs
to
a
significant
extent
or
else
it's
just
forbidden
to
carry
broadcasting.
and
then
his
b
and
c
applied
to
the
program
originated,
the
cablecasting
programs.
one
was
provisions
that
they
may
sell
advertising
with
respect
to
such
programs
to
be
presented
only
at
natural
breaks
or
intermissions
in
the
programs,
and
c
is
that
this
programming
that
they
originate
this
cablecasting
is
required
generally
to
comply
with
the
equal
opportunity
and
fairness
doctrine
provisions
and
sponsorship
identification
provisions
of
the
communications
act
and
of
the
rules.
the
respondent
here
challenged
all
three
aspects,
that
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
program
origination
requirement
is
invalid
and
then
refused
to
pass
on
the
validity
of
the
remaining
rules
on
the
ground
that
the
respondent
lacks
standing
to
challenge
them
since
it
did
not
intend
to
originate
any
programming,
once
the
programming
requirement,
the
origination
requirement
was
struck
down.
so
the
only
question
before
this
court
is
the
validity
of
the
origination
or
cablecasting
requirement.
the
respondent
correctly
points
out
that
no
cablecasting
was
involved
in
the
southwestern
case.
and
i
have
already
mentioned
that
the
rule
at
issue
here
applies
only
to
systems
that
carry
broadcast
signals,
not
to
the
presently
nonexistent
possibility
of
a
system
that
does
nothing
but
cablecasting.
so
there
is
no
need
for
the
court
in
this
case
to
reach
any
question
of
the
commission's
jurisdiction
over
cablecasting
as
it
stands
alone.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
a
programming
over
the
cable
that
does
not
involve
any
broadcast
signals
or
any
broadcast
originating
program.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
wholly
originated
by
the
cablecaster
although
it
may
not
necessarily
be
local
programming,
there
can
be
programming
that
supply
to
him
from
elsewhere,
including
networking
possibilities
here,
but
it
would
not
be
programming
that
originates
through
radio
signals
that
are
being
broadcast
to
other
viewers.
it
could
be
programming
that
is
sent
to
him
by
radio
signals
that
are
not
really
broadcast
signals.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
a
possibility.
the
rule
contemplates
that
some
of
this
origination
requirement
could
be
met
by
networking
or
other
interconnected
programming,
although
there
is
a
requirement
that
there
be
local
facilities
available
but
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
there
is
also
the
possibility
of
this
networking
including
the
use
of
satellites,
which
has
been
discussed
in
the
course
of
these
rulemaking
proceedings
as
a
possible
way
of
networking
cablecasting.
it's
not
the
primary
purpose
of
the
rule,
but
a
substantial
part
of
the
cable
systems
obligations
could
be
fulfilled
by
use
of
these
services,
and
it's
one
consideration
that
we
think
should
be
taken
into
account
with
respect
to
the
commission's
authority
here
although
it's
not
the
basic,
the
heart
of
the
commission's
rationale
here.
all
of
the
programs
whether
broadcast
originated
or
not,
are
supplied
by
cable
systems
as
they
exist
today
to
their
subscribers
over
the
same
cable,
and
from
the
standpoint
of
the
viewer
turning
the
dial
from
one
channel
to
another,
cablecasting
offered
by
the
system
is
for
all
practical
purposes
undifferentiated
from
the
other
services
being
offered,
and
indeed
from
broadcast
services
that
he
receives.
for
this
reason,
we
think
it
fairly
clear
that
under
the
ancillary
standard,
reasonably
ancillary
standard
of
southwestern
cable,
the
commission
must
have
some
authority
to
regulate
cablecasting
service
because
if
the
system
were
free
to
ignore
its
cablecasting,
the
fairness,
equal
opportunities,
sponsorship
identification
requirements,
that
otherwise
exist
on
the
set,
their
overall
effect
would
be
quite
seriously
undermined
and
there
is
also
the
problem
of
the
possible
use
of
pay
cablecasting.
this
would
be
a
per
program
or
per
service
fee
rather
than
just
the
subscription
for
hooking
in
to
the
cable,
and
the
concerns
of
the
commission
has
had
about
the
siphoning
off
through
pay
television
of
programming
that
is
now
available
free
to
viewers.
it
could
very
well
be
undermined,
if
pay
cablecasting
could
come
in,
and
perform
the
same
siphoning
off
of
programming
and
the
commission
were
powerless
to
regulate.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
not
not
that
kind
but
i
am
talking
about
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
there
is
a
subscription
fee.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
that
sense,
but
now
i
am
talking
about
the
additional
element
of
a
per
service
or
a
per
program
fee
that
you
can't
get
the
particular
program
unless
you
pay
a
particular
fee
for
it,
such
as
we
have
with
pay
broadcast
television.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
advertising
it
--
there
isn't,
with
respect
to
the
broadcast
programming
that
is
carried.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
there
--
it
is
now
--
they
can
carry
the
advertising
that
is
already
put
on
the
air
by
the
broadcast.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
as
it
is,
and
they
don't
interfere
with
the
advertising
that
is
on
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
in
their
cablecasting
operations,
the
commission
has
authorized
them
to
introduce
advertising,
but
only
at
natural
breaks
in
the
programming.
they
are
not
authorized
to
interrupt
the
programming,
and
those
systems
that
are
now
engaging
in
cablecasting
do
have
advertising
from
the
originated
program.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
all
do
operate
with
subscriber's
fees.
of
course,
to
the
extent
that
their
programming
cost
can
be
defrayed
through
advertising
there
than
able
to
reduce
subscription
fees,
and
the
commission
considers
these
matters
and
decided
to
authorize
advertising
to
that
limited
extent
with
cablecasting.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
they
have
the
option
to
carry
it
just
as
broadcasting.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
nothing
to
stop
them
if
they
choose
to
limit
their
advertising
that
way,
they
do
have
the
fairness
doctrine
requirements
and
the
equal
opportunities
requirements
to
comply
with,
and
in
the
commission's
view,
and
not
in
the
commission's
rule,
if
the
commission
has
authority
to
apply
them.
and
of
course
we
contend
that
they
do,
but
the
question
here
is
whether
the
commission
had
authority
to
apply
the
origination
requirement
to
cablecasters,
to
cable
systems
that
would
prefer
not
to
do
any
cablecasting,
that
is
the
issue
here,
and
while
we
do
not
concede
that
the
reasonably
ancillary
standard
of
southwestern
sets
the
outer
limit
of
the
commission's
authority
with
respect
to
cable
television.
our
position
is
that
that
standard
is
met
with
respect
to
the
origination
requirement
also,
which
brings
me
now
to
the
rationale
of
the
commission
which
is
at
the
heart
of
this
requirement
that
they
have
imposed.
this
court
in
southwestern
recognize
the
legitimacy
of
the
commission's
concern
that
local
broadcast
service
not
be
destroyed
or
foreclosed
by
unregulated
importation
of
distant
broadcast
signals
on
cable
systems.
and
there
are
two
reasons
for
this
concern.
one
is
the
importance
to
the
public
of
programming
the
deals
with
local
issues
of
public
importance
which
can
only
reasonably
be
anticipated
on
local
service,
and
the
other
reason
is
the
very
practical
problem
that
cable
systems
do
not
serve
many
persons
in
their
area
who
are
served
by
local
broadcasting.
both
because
some
of
these
persons
cannot
or
will
not
pay
the
subscription
fees,
and
because
it
is
prohibitively
expensive
to
extend
the
cable
to
those
who
are
in
rural
areas
or
other
sparsely
populated
areas.
the
development
of
cablecasting
on
these
cable
systems
however
offers
in
the
commission's
view,
compensating
opportunities
for
service
to
the
community
that
cannot
otherwise
be
made
available
both
because
it
overcomes
the
physical
limitations
of
the
broadcast
spectrum
on
program
diversity
and
because
it
offers
new
possibilities
for
specialized
local
service.
for
example,
if
you
have
a
system
that
brings
new
york
city
signals
into
a
small
community
in
pennsylvania
as
we
do
or
you
could
just
as
well
use
a
system
bringing
denver
signals
into
small
communities
in
colorado
or
in
wyoming
as
we
have.
you
have
an
illustration
of
the
sort
of
thing
that
i
mean.
it
may
be
that
the
ability
of
the
local
broadcasters
to
continue
serving
this
small
community
and
other
small
communities
in
the
area
will
be
threatened
by
the
importation
of
these
signals.
and
perhaps
other
communities
will
also
have
their
own
cable
systems.
but
it
is
also
true
that
the
cable
system
which
now
they
have
up
to
20
channels
on
the
cable
and
provide
many
services
to
the
subscribers
in
this
local
community
that
really
can't
as
a
practical
matter
be
performed
by
broadcasters.
because
they
serve
only
a
very
local
community.
it’s
quite
possible
for
the
two
candidates
for
mayor
to
have
a
debate
on
one
of
the
cable
casting
channels
or
a
panel
discussion
to
be
held
on
a
local
school
board
problems
or
other
matters
of
particular
local
concern.
it’s
even
possible
for
small
merchants
who
want
only
a
local
audience
to
advertise
to.
to
have
available
to
them
facilities
that
really
are
not
available
through
broadcasting.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
are
some
grandfather
provisions
involved.
but
they
are
not
at
issue
in
the
present
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
our
submission
is
that
the
power
derives
basically
from
the
fact
that
these
systems
do
use
broadcast
signals.
and
what
the
commission
has
concluded
here
is
that
the
impairment
or
the
threat,
the
possible
threat
here
to
television
service
that
results
from
the
commission’s
authorization
of
the
use
of
the
radio
signals
is
the
sustenance
of
these
systems
is
offset.
it’s
sufficiently
compensated
for
by
the
news
services
to
the
community
that
cable
casting
can
provide.
so
that
it’s
only
in
light
of
both
aspects
of
the
operation
that
the
commission
is
willing
to
go
ahead
and
authorize
the
services
to
the
extent
they
have
to
use
radio
signals.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
only
would
i
say
but
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
commission's
rule
does
apply
in
that
case.
it’s
largely
because
of
the
impact
on
the
viewer
to
him
the
differentiation
of
whether
it’s
coming
in
his
cable
casting
or
his
broadcasting
is
not
all
that
apparent
as
he
flips
from
one
station
to
another.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
rather
commission
and
if
the
fairness
doctrine
is
to
operate
effectively
or
if
the
equal
opportunities
provision
had
to
operate
effectively
but
what
is
the
commission
to
do,
if
the
cablecasting
is
all
going
to
feature
people
from
one
party.
should
the
commission
then
say
that
in
compensation
for
that
the
broadcasters
must
wait
their
presentations
in
favor
of
the
other
party.
it
seems
that
the
commission
has
the
idea
is
to
get
an
overall
effect
that’s
fair
through
the
television
set.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
commission
has
not
attempted
to
apply
that
far
and
that
would
present
a
much
more
difficult
question.
but
at
least
the
viewer
there
would
tend
to
be
more
aware
that
he's
listening
only
to
someone
who
is
coming
in
with
a
cable
casting
operation.
as
it
is
now,
it
is
served
by
a
single
cable
that
presents
a
mixture
of
broadcast
originated
programming
where
these
protections
apply.
and
the
other
is
not
very
aware
of
which
he's
getting
at
any
given
moment.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
it
has
relevance
in
this
respect.
of
course,
it
only
decided
whether
there
is
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
it
does
indicate
that
--
it
seems
to
me,
it
goes
somewhat
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
commission's
rule
and
i
am
obviously
not
going
to
have
time
to
discuss
that
issue
at
any
length.
i
think
it's
well-developed
in
the
course
of
the
appendix
here.
the
considerations
that
the
commission
gave
to
financial
arguments
resulting
ultimately
in
the
waiver
that
they
provided.
but
the
fact
is
broadcasters
who
do
have
to
pay
for
networking
and
other
programs
that
they
receive.
and
who
do
not
receive
any
fees
from
their
subscribes
are
all
required
by
the
commission
to
provide
local
service
of
a
public
interest
nature.
and
when
it
comes
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
rule,
what
the
commission
has
done
here
is
to
say
that
cablecasters
now
have
the
capacity
to
provide
additional
kinds
of
local
service
that
are
not
available
through
broadcasting.
should
be
required
to
do
the
same
sort
of
thing
when
they
have
the
financial
capacity
to
do
so
and
the
commission
has
been
very
cautious
on
the
question
of
the
financial
capacity
rather
than
just
exist
in
a
parasitic
relationship
to
broadcasting.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
it
was
developed
in
the
course
of
very
lengthy
considerations
here
that
i
rehearsed
quite
a
bit
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
and
if
i
may
just
refer
you
to
the
relevant
pages.
first
is
pages
38
through
45
of
the
appendix
in
which
the
commission
originally
arrived
at
that
figure
on
the
basis
of
detailed
information
that
was
submitted
to
it.
and
especially
noting
that
more
than
70%
of
the
cablecasters
now
in
existence
now
cablecasting,
have
less
than
3,500
subscribers.
and
also
in
light
of
the
flexibility
of
their
rules,
they're
not
required
in
order
to
meet
this
rule
to
engage
in
a
high
cost
operation.
the
chart
on
page
40
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
indicates
that
it's
possible
to
get
down
to
what's
called
a
small
monochrome
system
or
minimum
monochrome
system
that
is
much
less
costly
for
those
who
don't
really
have
the
financial
resources
to
do
better.
and
then
if
i
may
add
references
to
pages
58
and
59,
where
the
commission
considered
this
further
upon
motions
for
reconsideration.
and
then
finally,
pages
66
and
67
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
in
which
the
commission
setup
procedures
for
waiver
and
said
that
any
system
with
less
than
10,000
subscribers
when
it
applies
for
a
waiver,
will
get
an
automatic
stay
until
the
waiver
situation
is
clarified,
until
the
waiver
decision
is
made.
the
commission
has
been
very
cautious
on
the
question
of
financial
capacity
and
burden
here.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
i
may
say
so,
your
honor,
it
reads
to
me
like
a
dissenting
opinion
of
the
commissioner
to
this
report
in
order
rather
than
an
opinion
on
review.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you
sir.
