mr.

mr.

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
has
there
been
any
amendment
in
this
area
since
cable
television
emerged
as
a
real
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
the
origination
doesn't
really
have
controlling
impact
here,
doesn't
it?
it
could
originate
network
in
new
york
and
be
deliver
in
ohama,
nebraska
by
cable,
could
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
all
cable
television
pay
television?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
comes
into
your
home
by
wire.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
a
pay
television,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
noticed
that
judge
gibson
was
somewhat
exercised
about
the
problems
of
advertising,
is
there
advertising
on
cable
television?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
not
on
those
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
they
pick
it
up
from
a
network
or
another
station
and
then
run
it
by
cable
into
the
private
home
they
take
it
as
it
is.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
cable
television
as
such
does
not
introduce
advertising
on
the
wire,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
that
mean
the
viewers
are
going
to
pay
a
fee
to
get
advertising
piped
into
their
homes
and
televisions,
ever
since
department
can
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
wallace
as
i
read
judge
gibson's
concurring
opinion
at
least,
he
doesn't
--
he
does
not
question
fcc
power
in
any
broad
sense,
i
noted
in
his
opinion,
he
uses
the
phrase
at
this
time
at
least
to,
perhaps
three
times
in
his
opinion.
and
he
addresses
himself
to
the
particular
order
so
that
his
question
really
doesn't
go
to
power
but
to
the
discussion
of
the
commission
in
exercising
pervasive
power
at
this
particular
time
and
in
particular
way.

mr.

well,
you

operating
a

stage
of

installing.
