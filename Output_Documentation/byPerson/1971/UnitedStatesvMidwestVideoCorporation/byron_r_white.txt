that
notice
announced
that
the
commission
would
explore
“how
best
to
obtain
consistent

standard
of
the

the

well,
i
think
there
is
nothing
expressed
in
the
act
that
says
that
a
cablecasting
as
such
is
subject
to
the
commission's
regulation.
let's
assume
which,
is
true
that
a
cablecaster
carried
no
broadcast
signals,
he
just
originated
programs.
is
there
something
in
the
act?
justice
byron

it
had
to
be
a
common
carrier
by
wire
to
be
subject
i
take
it.
justice

white
commission
does
have
jurisdiction
over
interstate
communications
by
wire?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
they
common
carriers?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
there
was
some
real
statutory
authority,
obvious
statutory
authority
over
just
wired
communications,
we
wouldn't
have
had
this
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
but
the
commission
would
have
decided
it
differently.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
no
amended
tv
sets
can
received
that?
justice
byron

primarily

is
to

local
--
justice

there
is
no
grandfather

here.
justice
byron

white
or
may
be
plenty
of
reasons
for
this
but
is
your
submission
in
terms
of
power
that
because
a
cablecaster
does
use
broadcast
signals
that
gives
the
fcc
power
to
order
him
or
to
control
rest
of
his
program
or
to
supervise
the
content
of
rest
of
his
program?
justice
byron
r.
white
true
but
commission's
power
and
authority?
justice
byron
r.
white
assume
the
non-existent
cablecaster,
doesn't
use
broadcasting.
and
assume
that
the
commission
had
power
over
that
broadcaster
to
license
with
that
cablecaster.
would
you
think
the
fairness
doctrine
would
have
the
same
basis
in
the
constitution?
justice
byron

white
mr.
wallace
that
point
is,
we
do
have
this
demarcation
of
3,500
subscribers.
do
we
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
my
question
is,
is
there
anything
arbitrary
about
the
3,500
mark?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
because
they
are
carrying
broadcast
signals.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
that
they
are
carrying
it
by
wire.
justice
byron

and
did
southwestern
approve
the
power
commission
to
force
the
cable
tvs
to
carry
things
they
didn't
want
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
order
to
carry
local
stations?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
the
cable
operators
have
to
carry
all
local
stations
even
though
they
didn't
want
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know,
but
was
that
involved
in
southwestern?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
upheld
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
challenge
that
as
well,
i
mean
if
your
position
were
sustained,
would
you
say
that
commission
couldn't
force
the
cable
tv
people
to
carry
all
local
station?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
just
wonder
all,
mr.
plotkin,
i
just
wondered
if
your
position
--
if
your
position
were
sustained,
would
it
also
invalidate
that
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
some
of
the
mountainous
areas
out
west
can't
get
television
without
--
.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
there
is
a
licensed
tv
station
and
the
operator
and
the
owner
prefers
to
just
to
be
a
transmitter,
to
get
a
network
100%.
justice
byron

and
doesn't
the
commission
have
power
to
tell
him
he
has
to
put
on
the
air,
certain
amount
of
local
program
and
originate
some
programs.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
say
to
the
cablecaster,
if
you
want
to
use
broadcast
signals,
you've
to
get
a
little
piece
of
paper
from
us.
justice
byron

white
that
you
call
the
license
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
does
anything
--
they
have
to
get
permission?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
commission
says
to
him,
if
you
want
to
use
these
broadcast
signals,
you
have
got
to
carry
for
the
houses,
a
certain
balance
of
programs.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
difference
between
the
two
situations?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
in
the
example
i
gave
you,
a
man
says
all
i

all
i

don't
