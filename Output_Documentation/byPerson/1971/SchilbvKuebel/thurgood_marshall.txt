justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
rooney,
the
fact
that
1%,
is
it
not
$100,000
bond
and
a
$1000
bond
are
the
same
kind
of
papers,
just
fixing
the
amount
of
time--
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean,
why
does
not
he
just
have
flat
rate
of
$10
for
each
bond.
is
anything
in
history
on
that
at
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
see.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
that
the
original
one
that
of
the
three
systems
of
bail
in
illinois,
there
is
only
one
that
get
1%
charges.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
all
three
of
them
need
court
officials
to
do
the
paperwork,
all
three
of
them.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
only
basis
of
this
1%
on
this
would
be
because
of
this
special
new
thing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
could
release
him
for
nothing,
on
recognizance.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
what
i
think
is
the
petitioner’s
argument.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
the
difference
is
that
you
take
position
that
once
you
reach
to
the
point
where
he
is
not
eligible
(inaudible).
he
is
in
a
different
category
and
if
he
gets
his
10%,
he
has
to
pay
for
that
because
he
does
not
have
to
put
the
money,
that
is
your
position,
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
confused,
they
would
have
paid
10%
to
the
bond,
like
these
people
right
here
and
there
would
not
be
any
like
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
illinois
says,
if
you
pay
us
the
10%,
we
will
let
you
out
on
the
same
condition
and
when
the
case
is
over
we
will
give
you
9%
back
(voice
overlap)
i
mean,
how
do
you
lose
on
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
does
this
man
lose?
