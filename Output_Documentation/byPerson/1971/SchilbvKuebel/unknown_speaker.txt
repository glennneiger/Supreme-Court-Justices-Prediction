unknown
speaker
your
honor
prior
to
proceeding
i
would
like
to
make
a
motion.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
even
if
it
were
simply
that
everyone
has
set
released
under
it
either
of
the
three
provisions
would
pay
$10
(inaudible),
is
it
still
like
that?
unknown
speaker
true
indigent,
might
be
if
he
could
not
pay
up,
that
would
be
one
of
problem.
but
you
would
also
say
it
was
unconstitutional
as
charge
found
innocent--
unknown
speaker
--of
the
$10,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
everybody
who
walks
with
a
lower
amount
pays
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
gather
your
class
here
is
not
relative
to
indigent--
unknown
speaker
indigents,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
yes
but,
you
mean
the
true
indigent
would
not
have
a
10%
of
those,
will
he?
unknown
speaker
but
would
it
be
about
people
here
who,
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
who
have
posted
the
10%--
unknown
speaker
and
whose
complaint
is
that
when
the
purpose
of
the
bail
has
been
served,
they
get
back
only
90%
of
what
they
deposit.
so
we
are
really
about
indigents
as
indigents?
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
saying
that
the
statement
did
not
say
to
anybody,
we
will
relieve
you
from
the
obligation
to
post
a
100%
of
bail
which
is
parole
system,
we
will
give
you
the
option
--
we
will
give
you
the
chance
of
getting
out
on
bail
by
depositing
10%
but
in
that
case,
it
is
going
to
cost
you
something,
it
is
going
to
cost
you
1%.
unknown
speaker
do
they
say
that
to
everybody?
unknown
speaker
they
say
that
for
everybody?
unknown
speaker
but
if
i
were
a
rich
man
or
if
i
had
some
money
and
the
state
gave
me
this
charge,
it
would
still
be
invalid
to
me?
unknown
speaker
well
as
i
get
it--
if
you
have
--
those
who
were
released
on
own
recognizance.
unknown
speaker
--are
charged
no
fees.
unknown
speaker
--
to
support
the
bail
system
or
administration,
right?
unknown
speaker
those
who
post
to
100%
are
charged
no
fees.
unknown
speaker
the
only
ones
who
pay
are
those
who
post
10%--
unknown
speaker
and
they
are
charged
10%
of
the
10%.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
well
obviously,
there
is
an
expense
to
administering
this
purpose.
unknown
speaker
of
course
they
could
put
$5
bail,
they
can
impose
$5
ahead
on
everyone
who
has
admitted
the
bail.
in
other
words
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
not
have
anymore
trouble
in
the
areas
of
the
true
indigents
and
you
have
worked
with
this
present
system
where
a
true
indigent
is
required
to
put
up
10%
of
the
bail
and
if
he
cannot
pay
it,
he
stays
in
jail.
unknown
speaker
mr.
o’toole,
what
do
you
think
was
the
supposed
policy
behind
the
distinction
between
the
10%
people
and
the
100%
people?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
think
it
was
that
the
10%
people
would
be
more
likely
to
jump
bonds
of
those
who
have
done
a
100%?
unknown
speaker
and
this
is
a
bailable
offense.
unknown
speaker
yeah,
the
number
released
on
--
unknown
speaker
what
for
is
that
10%
should
be
paid?
unknown
speaker
usually,
what
are
the
forms
may
it
take?
unknown
speaker
so,
it
has
to
be
cash?
unknown
speaker
mr.
rooney
then
tell
us,
what
you
think
is
the
purpose
of
the
1%?
unknown
speaker
and
then
what
is
in
the
charge
if
the
man
who
puts
a
100%
down?
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
is
it
hard
for
them
to
justify
those
who
are
out
on
their
own
recognizance?
unknown
speaker
what
if
we
charge
it
to
them?
they
are
not
necessarily
indigent.
as
a
matter
of
fact
that's
what
likely
they
are.
unknown
speaker
not
expense
wise
to
the
system?
unknown
speaker
well
exactly
--
let
us
now
ever
consider
a
fact
free
basis
instead
of--
unknown
speaker
have
other
states
adopted
systems
like
the
state
of
illinois?
unknown
speaker
have
they
gone
to
the
10%
deposit
and
so
forth,
do
you
know
whether
they
charge?
unknown
speaker
they
charge
a
flat
rate
or
what?
what
do
the
others
do?
charge
nothing
or
charge
a
flat
rate?
unknown
speaker
that's
is
1%
not
1,000,000,
we
are
taking
about
10%,
the
10%
deposit,
the
total
of
all
debts,
10%
deposit
is
how
much?
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
that
much
money--
unknown
speaker
can
you
make
any
suggestions
whether
the
state
considers
that
a
fellow
puts
up
a
100%
and
provided
the
state
with
money
from
which
the
state
earns
this
interest
enough
so
that
he
makes
a
contribution
not
unlike
that
of
the
1%
charge
against
the
fellow
who
puts
his
own
recognizance.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
it
has
to
be
encumbered
real
estate.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
recognizance
people?
unknown
speaker
i
know
you
said
that
but
i
do
not
understand
it.
they
are
different
in
the
sense
that
they
do
not
have
to
put
up
any
money.
unknown
speaker
that
is
true,
but
are
you
saying
that
you
are
deciding
in
advance
there
are
certain
kind
of
people
as
that
people
and
a
hundred
people--
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)in
extensive
expense
of
administering
the
program.
there
is
certainly
an
expense
involved
in
connection
with
those
who
are
released
on
their
own
recognizance
that
(voice
overlap)
unknown
speaker
i
know
the
state
considers
them
different
but
how
are
they
different
so
that
a
state
may
satisfy
their
entire
burden
out
of
this
one
group?
unknown
speaker
--just
made
a
decision
that
it
is
not
going
to
require
the
people
involved
to
contribute
to
the
administrative
cost
of
the
cash
bond
system
but
not
to
the
collateral
bond
system
but
not
to
the
recognizance
bond
system
and
the
question
is
whether
or
not
that
can
be
rationally
supported?
unknown
speaker
but
when
one
is
released
on
his
own
recognizance,
does
he
execute,
i
know
that
you
said,
i-bond,
does
he
execute
a
bond,
a
personal
bond
in
the
amount
15,000,
10,000,
25,000?
unknown
speaker
whenever
the
judge
fixes?
but
the
only
difference
is
that
he
executes
a
personal
bond
without
surety,
really,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
he
does
not
sign
the
bond
that
agreed
to
show
up
or
not?
unknown
speaker
but
if
he
does
not,
he
can
forfeit
15,000
--
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
sure
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
your
personal
recognizance
is
that
typical
kind
of
--
unknown
speaker
so
the
bond
that
is
signed
by
the
individual
with
no
assurance.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
the
same
question
i
asked
your
opponent.
if
you
lose
this
case,
do
you
anticipate
to
return
to
the
old
bondsman
system?
unknown
speaker
so
really
(inaudible)--
let
us
say
that
the
judge
set
bail
on
every
case
to
some
people
and
you
have
to
put
up
the
100%,
a
lot
of
people
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
puts
up
10%
or
100
—
unknown
speaker
entirely.
unknown
speaker
the
law
permitted,
the
law
permitted
these
three
ways
of
identifying
the
bail
law
procedures.
have
you
ever
released
anyone
there,
just
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
well
what
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
that
is
why
that
any
forms
of
bond,
in
my
state
we
have
on
personal
recognizance
judge
(inaudible)
decided
a
personal
bond
of
$15,000
if
we
did
not
show
up
and
the
state
would
have
to
reduce
that
bond
and
judgement
against
your
property
or
the
judge
could
say
that
at
many
times,
i
will
just
accept
your
promise
that
you
will
show
up,
do
you
not
have
that?
unknown
speaker
but
the
court
would
not
have
undertaken
the
pay
himself,
obviously.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean
the
bondsmen
are
not
plotting
this
as
the
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
worried
about
these
people.
(voice
overlap)
these
people
who
instead
of
paying
10%
have
paid
9%.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
you
pay
1%,
and
they
are
complaining?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
would
agree
that
—
unknown
speaker
yes,
your
honor.
but,
in
relation
to
mr.
justice
brennan’s
question,
there
are
several
jurisdictions,
there
are
three
jurisdictions
at
present
which
have
a
10%
deposit
statute
such
as
illinois
too
charge
no
one
any
cost
that
has
—
unknown
speaker
iowa
and,
i
think
it
is
alaska,
your
honor.
wisconsin
last
july,
july
of
1969
put
in
10%
deposit
statute.
they
charged
the
guilty
who
deposited
10%,
1%
and
charged
the
innocent
nothing.
and
in
the
state
of
new
york,
they
have
across
the
board
2%,
i
believe
--
unknown
speaker
no
matter
how
you
are
released,
but
they
do
not
have
10%
system
such
as
ours,
it
is
not
a
true
10%
deposit
system.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
that
is
under
the
federal
act,
your
honor.
now,
right
after
the
state
of
illinois
enacted
our
10%,
the
federal
government
congress
—
88th
congress,
there
were
three
bills
introduced
in
the
senate.
one
of
the
bills
was
the
identical
provision
that
we
have
here
in
illinois
and
that
is
10%
in
10%
charge.
those
bills
died
in
the
committee
in
the
88th
congress
and
were
resubmitted
into
the
89th
congress
and
between
the
two
sessions
of
congress,
the
congress
pulled
out
the
10%
charge,
so
now
there
is
no
charge
in
the
federal
system
which
permits
a
judge
to
release
a
person
on
less
than
full
bond
in
his
discretion.
now
our
system
is
contra
into
the
federal
system
and
those
are
the
only
jurisdictions
i
know
that
have
any
provision
for
release
on
less
than
full.
in
relation
to
the
statistics,
now
we
just
wish
to
make
one
observation
in
as
to
all
people
would
make
a
deposit,
their
conclusion,
if
you
return
to
their
statistics,
you
would
note
one
thing
that
have
have
not
broken
down.
initially,
all
people
who
have
a
bond
of
$25
or
less,
this
is
on
minor
offenses,
must
post
the
full
amount,
there
is
not
any
10%
deposit
on
$25
or
less,
so
that
throws
the
statistics
out
a
little
bit.
the
second
thing
is
that
on
taking
a
look
at
their
breakdown,
in
district
number
1
which
is
the
city
of
chicago,
where
1
out
of
47
puts
up
the
full
amount
of
bond.
if
you
take
a
look
at
district
number
3,
which
is
a
relatively
affluent
suburban
area,
2
out
of
every
5
deposit
the
full
amount,
and
what
benefit
do
they
get
and
why
do
they
do
it?
well
one,
they
have
the
means
to
do
it,
and
just
as
the
individual
who
gets
out
on
his
own
recognizance
and
incidentally,
mr.
justice
brennan,
there
was
no
amount
mentioned
in
our
rare
occasion,
but
then
only
about
2%
of
people.
bail
application
in
the
state
of
illinois
is
not
at
its
best,
well
not
in
the
record,
it
is
just
a
matter
of
information
that
there
is
a
schedule
in
cook
county
for
bail,
$10,000
for
this,
narcotics
arrest,
take
the
advice
of
the
narcotics
officer,
these
are
the
directions
that
go
to
the
judges.
about
2%
are
released
on
their
own
own
recognizance.
now
what
benefit
or
why
would
somebody
who
has
to
full
post
the
full
amount,
because
he
has
the
ability
to
post
treasury
bills,
stocks,
bonds,
any
type
of
security
representing
an
interest.
he
can
pledge
for
his
freedom
and
leave
that
asset
in
tact
and
earn
interest
while
we
are
imposing
a
cost
here,
we
are
allowing
this
person
to
continue
making
money
on
his
investment.
and
here
he
sees
about
it,
the
person
who
was
released
are
allowed
to
see
the
benefit,
the
10%
person
receives
the
benefit.
well,
why
should
a
system
insist
that
one
segment
of
those
who
are
released
on
bond
support
that
entire
system
and
when
there
is
not
even
a
need
for
it
because
the
same
bond
forfeitures
that
existed
prior
to
the
act
exist
today.
this
is
actually
a
fiscal
policy
of
increasing
the
revenues
and
that
is
all
it
is.
unknown
speaker
your
honor
prior
to
proceeding
i
would
like
to
make
a
motion.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
even
if
it
were
simply
that
everyone
has
set
released
under
it
either
of
the
three
provisions
would
pay
$10
(inaudible),
is
it
still
like
that?
unknown
speaker
true
indigent,
might
be
if
he
could
not
pay
up,
that
would
be
one
of
problem.
but
you
would
also
say
it
was
unconstitutional
as
charge
found
innocent--
unknown
speaker
--of
the
$10,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
everybody
who
walks
with
a
lower
amount
pays
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
gather
your
class
here
is
not
relative
to
indigent--
unknown
speaker
indigents,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
yes
but,
you
mean
the
true
indigent
would
not
have
a
10%
of
those,
will
he?
unknown
speaker
but
would
it
be
about
people
here
who,
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
who
have
posted
the
10%--
unknown
speaker
and
whose
complaint
is
that
when
the
purpose
of
the
bail
has
been
served,
they
get
back
only
90%
of
what
they
deposit.
so
we
are
really
about
indigents
as
indigents?
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
saying
that
the
statement
did
not

in
that

it
is
going

something,
it
is
going
to
cost
you
1%.
unknown
speaker
do
they
say
that
to
everybody?
unknown
speaker
they
say
that
for
everybody?
unknown
speaker
but
if
i
were
a
rich
man
or
if
i
had
some
money
and
the
state
gave

this

it
would
still

unknown

well
as
i

if
you

unknown
speaker
--are
charged
no

unknown
speaker
--
to
support
the
bail

or

right?
unknown
speaker
those
who
post
to
100%
are
charged
no

unknown
speaker
the
only
ones
who
pay
are
those
who
post
10%--
unknown
speaker
and
they
are
charged
10%
of
the
10%.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
well
obviously,
there
is
an
expense
to
administering
this
purpose.
unknown
speaker
of
course
they
could
put
$5
bail,
they
can
impose
$5

on

and
this
is
a

unknown

yeah,
the
number
released
on
--
unknown
speaker
what
for
is
that
10%
should
be
paid?
unknown
speaker
usually,
what
are
the
forms
may
it
take?
unknown
speaker
so,
it
has
to
be
cash?
unknown
speaker
mr.
rooney
then
tell
us,
what
you
think
is
the
purpose
of
the
1%?
unknown
speaker
and
then
what
is
in
the
charge
if
the
man
who
puts
a
100%
down?
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
is
it
hard
for
them
to
justify
those
who
are
out
on
their
own
recognizance?
unknown
speaker
what
if
we
charge
it
to
them?
they
are
not
necessarily
indigent.
as
a
matter
of
fact
that's
what
likely
they
are.
unknown
speaker
not
expense
wise
to
the
system?
unknown
speaker
well
exactly
--
let
us
now
ever
consider
a
fact
free
basis
instead
of--
unknown
speaker
have
other
states
adopted
systems
like
the
state
of
illinois?
unknown
speaker
have
they
gone
to
the
10%
deposit
and
so
forth,
do
you
know
whether
they
charge?
unknown
speaker
they
charge
a
flat
rate
or
what?
what
do
the
others
do?
charge
nothing
or
charge
a
flat
rate?
unknown
speaker
that's
is
1%
not
1,000,000,
we
are
taking
about
10%,
the
10%
deposit,
the
total
of
all
debts,
10%
deposit
is
how
much?
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
that
much
money--
unknown
speaker
can
you
make
any
suggestions
whether
the
state
considers
that
a
fellow
puts
up
a
100%
and
provided
the
state
with
money
from
which
the
state
earns
this
interest
enough
so
that
he
makes
a
contribution
not
unlike
that
of
the
1%
charge
against
the
fellow
who
puts
his
own
recognizance.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
it
has
to
be
encumbered
real
estate.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
recognizance
people?
unknown
speaker
i
know
you
said
that
but
i
do
not
understand
it.
they
are
different
in
the
sense
that
they
do
not
have
to
put
up
any
money.
unknown
speaker
that
is
true,
but
are
you
saying
that
you
are
deciding
in
advance
there
are
certain
kind
of
people
as
that
people
and
a
hundred
people--
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)in
extensive
expense
of
administering
the
program.
there
is
certainly
an
expense
involved
in
connection
with
those
who
are
released
on
their
own
recognizance
that
(voice
overlap)
unknown
speaker
i
know
the
state
considers
them
different
but
how
are
they
different
so
that
a
state
may
satisfy
their
entire
burden
out
of
this
one
group?
unknown
speaker
--just
made
a
decision
that
it
is
not
going
to
require
the
people
involved
to
contribute
to
the
administrative
cost
of
the
cash
bond
system
but
not
to
the
collateral
bond
system
but
not
to
the
recognizance
bond
system
and
the
question
is
whether
or
not
that
can
be
rationally
supported?
unknown
speaker
but
when
one
is
released
on
his
own
recognizance,
does
he
execute,
i
know
that
you
said,
i-bond,
does
he
execute
a
bond,
a
personal
bond
in
the
amount
15,000,
10,000,
25,000?
unknown
speaker
whenever
the
judge
fixes?
but
the
only
difference
is
that
he
executes
a
personal
bond
without
surety,
really,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
he
does
not
sign
the
bond
that
agreed
to
show
up
or
not?
unknown
speaker
but
if
he
does
not,
he
can
forfeit
15,000
--
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
sure
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
your
personal
recognizance
is
that
typical
kind
of
--
unknown
speaker
so
the
bond
that
is
signed
by
the
individual
with
no
assurance.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
the
same
question
i
asked
your
opponent.
if
you
lose
this
case,
do
you
anticipate
to
return
to
the
old
bondsman
system?
unknown
speaker
so
really
(inaudible)--
let
us
say
that
the
judge
set
bail
on
every
case
to
some
people
and
you
have
to
put
up
the
100%,
a
lot
of
people
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
puts
up
10%
or
100
—
unknown
speaker
entirely.
unknown
speaker
the
law
permitted,
the
law
permitted
these
three
ways
of
identifying
the
bail
law
procedures.
have
you
ever
released
anyone
there,
just
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
well
what
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
that
is
why
that
any
forms
of
bond,
in
my
state
we
have
on
personal
recognizance
judge
(inaudible)
decided
a
personal
bond
of
$15,000
if
we
did
not
show
up
and
the
state
would
have
to
reduce
that
bond
and
judgement
against
your
property
or
the
judge
could
say
that
at
many
times,
i
will
just
accept
your
promise
that
you
will
show
up,
do
you
not
have
that?
unknown
speaker
but
the
court
would
not
have
undertaken
the
pay
himself,
obviously.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean
the
bondsmen
are
not
plotting
this
as
the
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
worried
about
these
people.
(voice
overlap)
these
people
who
instead
of
paying
10%
have
paid
9%.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
you
pay
1%,
and
they
are
complaining?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
would
agree
that
—
unknown
speaker
yes,
your
honor.
but,
in
relation
to
mr.
justice
brennan’s
question,
there
are
several
jurisdictions,
there
are
three
jurisdictions
at
present
which
have
a
10%
deposit
statute
such
as
illinois
too
charge
no
one
any
cost
that
has
—
unknown
speaker
iowa
and,
i
think
it
is
alaska,
your
honor.
wisconsin
last
july,
july
of
1969
put
in
10%
deposit
statute.
they
charged
the
guilty
who
deposited
10%,
1%
and
charged
the
innocent
nothing.
and
in
the
state
of
new
york,
they
have
across
the
board
2%,
i
believe
--
unknown
speaker
no
matter
how
you
are
released,
but
they
do
not
have
10%
system
such
as
ours,
it
is
not
a
true
10%
deposit
system.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
that
is
under
the
federal
act,
your
honor.
now,
right
after
the
state
of
illinois
enacted
our
10%,
the
federal
government
congress
—
88th
congress,
there
were
three
bills
introduced
in
the
senate.
one
of
the
bills
was
the
identical
provision
that
we
have
here
in
illinois
and
that
is
10%
in
10%
charge.
those
bills
died
in
the
committee
in
the
88th
congress
and
were
resubmitted
into
the
89th
congress
and
between
the
two
sessions
of
congress,
the
congress
pulled
out
the
10%
charge,
so
now
there
is
no
charge
in
the
federal
system
which
permits
a
judge
to
release
a
person
on
less
than
full
bond
in
his
discretion.
now
our
system
is
contra
into
the
federal
system
and
those
are
the
only
jurisdictions
i
know
that
have
any
provision
for
release
on
less
than
full.
in
relation
to
the
statistics,
now
we
just
wish
to
make
one
observation
in
as
to
all
people
would
make
a
deposit,
their
conclusion,
if
you
return
to
their
statistics,
you
would
note
one
thing
that
have
have
not
broken
down.
initially,
all
people
who
have
a
bond
of
$25
or
less,
this
is
on
minor
offenses,
must
post
the
full
amount,
there
is
not
any
10%
deposit
on
$25
or
less,
so
that
throws
the
statistics
out
a
little
bit.
the
second
thing
is
that
on
taking
a
look
at
their
breakdown,
in
district
number
1
which
is
the
city
of
chicago,
where
1
out
of
47
puts
up
the
full
amount
of
bond.
if
you
take
a
look
at
district
number
3,
which
is
a
relatively
affluent
suburban
area,
2
out
of
every
5
deposit
the
full
amount,
and
what
benefit
do
they
get
and
why
do
they
do
it?
well
one,
they
have
the
means
to
do
it,
and
just
as
the
individual
who
gets
out
on
his
own
recognizance
and
incidentally,
mr.
justice
brennan,
there
was
no
amount
mentioned
in
our
rare
occasion,
but
then
only
about
2%
of
people.
bail
application
in
the
state
of
illinois
is
not
at
its
best,
well
not
in
the
record,
it
is
just
a
matter
of
information
that
there
is
a
schedule
in
cook
county
for
bail,
$10,000
for
this,
narcotics
arrest,
take
the
advice
of
the
narcotics
officer,
these
are
the
directions
that
go
to
the
judges.
about
2%
are
released
on
their
own
own
recognizance.
now
what
benefit
or
why
would
somebody
who
has
to
full
post
the
full
amount,
because
he
has
the
ability
to
post
treasury
bills,
stocks,
bonds,
any
type
of
security
representing
an
interest.
he
can
pledge
for
his
freedom
and
leave
that
asset
in
tact
and
earn
interest
while
we
are
imposing
a
cost
here,
we
are
allowing
this
person
to
continue
making
money
on
his
investment.
and
here
he
sees
about
it,
the
person
who
was
released
are
allowed
to
see
the
benefit,
the
10%
person
receives
the
benefit.
well,
why
should
a
system
insist
that
one
segment
of
those
who
are
released
on
bond
support
that
entire
system
and
when
there
is
not
even
a
need
for
it
because
the
same
bond
forfeitures
that
existed
prior
to
the
act
exist
today.
this
is
actually
a
fiscal
policy
of
increasing
the
revenues
and
that
is
all
it
is.
