mr.
james
a.
rooney
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
the
best
way
to
understand
why
the
illinois
10%
deposit
provisions
are
constitutional
to
take
a
look
at
what
we
had
in
illinois
before
they
were
passed.
prior
to
1963,
when
the
whole
bail
procedure
in
illinois
was
overhauled,
we
had
two
ways
of
getting
out
of
the
jail
once
bailed
had
been
set.
first
of
all,
you
had
a
release
on
recognizance
which
was
not
utilized,
that
was
perhaps
cured,
perhaps
not
cured
if
the
release
on
recognizance
is
doubled
in
illinois
since
the
bail
reform
statute
went
through.
it
has
doubled.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
the
number
released
on
recognizance
has
double
and
it
is
still
not
an
extremely
large
percent.
but
we
still
have
to
release
on
recognizance.
the
only
other
way
you
can
get
out
prior
to
1963
was
either
to
have
yourself
or
somebody
else
for
you
pledge
the
full
amount
of
the
bond.
now
because
you
have
to
pledge
the
full
amount
of
the
bond,
there
were
defacto
three
categories
of
people.
there
were
the
rich
who
could
put
up
the
full
amount
of
the
bond,
there
were
those
who
could
not
put
up
the
full
amount
of
the
bond
but
could
go
to
the
bondsman
to
pay
his
fee
and
get
out
that
way,
and
then
there
were
who
really
--
the
truly
indigent
who
just
did
not
have
the
money
even
to
go
to
the
bondsman,
they
have
to
stay
in
jail,
attending
the
trial
of
their
case.
now,
i
think
there
is
a
difference
of
opinion
as
to
the
purposes
of
110-7,
the
10%
bail
deposit
provisions.
they
were,
first
of
all,
designed
to
get
rid
of
the
bail
bondsman
in
illinois.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
the
10%,
usually
cash.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
the
statute
says
that,
money,
it
is
all.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
it
has
to
be
cash.
the
other
purpose
of
the
bail
reform
act
110-7
was
to
reduce
the
financial
imposition
on
those
who
had
to
go
to
the
bail
bondsman.
now,
the
reason
why
to
get
rid
of
the
bail
bondsman
is
fairly
obvious,
they
have
been
the
villains
for
all
the
legal
journals
over
the
last
20
year.
there
were
all
sorts
of
abuses
including
some
scandals
that
unfortunately
involved
judges
and
the
assistant
state
attorneys
in
cook
county
and
throughout
the
state
of
illinois
but
that
does
not
mean
that
bail
bondsman
should
still
be
around
just
because
we
had
judges
and
assistant
states
attorneys
involved.
the
big
problem
was
that,
by
statute
in
illinois,
a
bail
bondsman
could
charge
10%.
now,
that
was
suppose
to
be
the
maximum
limit
that
bail
bondsman
could
charge
but
unfortunately
in
things
like
this,
that
became
the
minimum
and
it
finally
got
to
the
place
where
the
bail
bondsman,
not
the
judge,
held
accused
to
the
jail
in
many
cases
because
if
you
are
unable
to
post
the
full
amount
of
the
bond
and
you
want
to
go
to
see
the
bail
bondsman,
the
bail
bondsman
will
take
a
look
at
you
and
you
will
decide
whether
or
not
you
are
a
good
risk.
if
you
are
not
at
good
risk,
the
price
went
up
and
so
10%
was
the
beginning
of
the
bargaining.
now
other
scandals
that
involved
the
bail
bondsman
having
judgments
vacated
and
not
returning
the
pledges
to
the
defendants,
and
of
course
the
way
they
got
the
defendants
back
to
the
courtroom
if
the
bond
had
been
jumped
was
notorious.
so,
what
the
illinois
legislature
wanted
to
do
is
first
of
all,
get
rid
of
the
bail
bondsman,
second
of
all,
make
it
a
little
bit
less
expensive
for
those
who
are
not
exercising
a
constitutional
right
but
exercising
really
statutory
right
to
get
out.
when
you
went
to
the
bail
bondsman,
you
put
down
the
amount
of
your
bail,
excuse
me,
the
10%
with
him,
the
statutory
amount
and
then
the
bail
bondsman
all
he
did
was
was
sign
a
bond,
he
did
not
have
to
put
down
any
money
because
he
had
money
down
in
his
bank,
that
is
the
way
it
worked.
but
when
you
put
down
that
10%,
that
is
the
less
you
saw
that
--
no
matter
whether
you
were
innocent,
not-guilty,
you
forfeited
10%
of
the
amount
of
your
bond.
now,
i
think
a
question
was
asked,
where
do
we
get
the
10%
and
the
1%?
mr.
james
a.
rooney
the
purpose
of
the
1%
is
to
cover
basically
the
expenses
of
the
clerk
in
writing
the
bonds,
keeping
records
on
the
bonds,
returning
forfeited
bonds—it
is
a
big
operation.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
it
is
not
charged
to
the
man
who
puts
a
100%
down
because
we
feel
that
he
is
exercising
a
constitutional
right.
we
feel
that
the
constitutional
right
is
the
right
to
a
reasonable
amount
of
bond.
now,
the
man
who
gets
the
100%
bond,
he
is
exercising
a
constitutional
right
to
what
his
reasonable
amount
would
be.
a
man
is
exercising
the
10%
right
is
exercising
a
statutory
right
which
we
feel
--
we
are
not
letting
him
out
on
reasonable
amount
of
bond,
we
are
letting
him
out
on
10%
of
what
a
reasonable
amount
would
be.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
it
makes
it
harder
to
justify
those
who
are
on
their
on
recognizance.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
we
think
they
are
little
differently
situated
than
those—
mr.
james
a.
rooney
no,
not
expense
wise
to
the
system
but
before
you
are
released
on
recognizance,
the
judge
makes
a
a
defacto
but
rather
extensive
look
into
your
background
and
we
think
that
these
type
of
defendants,
since
it
is
more
likely
that
they
will
show
up
and
it
is
all
relative,
the
sort
of
discretionary
with
the
judge
,
the
release
on
recognizance,
since
they
more
likely
to
show
up
do
we
think
that
there
is
sufficiently,
differently
situated
as
not
to
charge
them.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
i
do
not
believe
so.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
the
cost
of
the
state
is
across
the
board
and
in
the
stipulation
of
facts
when
we
process
a
bond
where
there
are
securities
or
mortgage
and
the
un-
mortgaged
real
estate
are
put
down,
there
is
perhaps
a
slightly
greater
expense
to
the
state
then
when
just
cash
is
put
down
under
the
10%
--
mr.
james
a.
rooney
not--
mr.
james
a.
rooney
no,
it
is
unique.
illinois
is
unique
in
charging
a
1%,
so
you
have
a
total
(voice
overlap)
mr.
james
a.
rooney
well,
a
good
example
is
the
federal
statute.
in
the
federal
statute,
it
is
up
to
the
discretion
of
the
judge
whether
he
lets
you
out
at
a
100%
or
10%.
now,
there
are
all
sorts
of
other
conditions
you
can
put
on
your
bond.
in
illinois,
the
legislatures
limited
the
discretion
of
the
judges
to
releasing
a
man
on
his
recognizance
or
setting
a
dollar
amount
of
bail.
the
legislature
has
not
vested
the
judge
with
that
type
of
discretion,
perhaps
by
an
amount
of
10%,
perhaps
not
by
the
amount
of
10%.
once
he
sets
the
amount,
it
is
automatic.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
correct.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
only
one.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
correct.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
no,
because
we
are
giving
them
a
special
benefit.
we
are
releasing
them
at
10%
of
the
amount
of
the
reasonable
bond.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
yes,
we
could.
that
is
not
utilized.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
well,
i
did
not
perhaps
understand
it
that
way.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
correct
and
as
i
try
to
explain,
i
believe
that
is
because
judges
made
a
determination
before
we
get
to
that
point
that
he
is
substantially
different.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
correct.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
correct,
absolutely
right.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
yes,
he
just
signs
a
bond
promising
that
he
will
show
up.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
he
forfeits
the
face
amount
of
the
bond.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
well,
it
depends
on
the
type
of
the
offense.
the
judge
sets
what
the
amount
of
bond
would
be
except
for
the
fact
the
he
feels
this
accused
person
is
a
type
of
person
who
is
most
likely
to
show
up
for
trial
and
therefore
the
state
will
not
have
to
go
to
additional
expense
of
going
out
and
looking
for
him
and
bringing
him
to
trial.
one
of
the
problems
with
the
bail
bond
system
was
that
the
bail
bonds,
it
was
not
the
man
that
returned
to
defendant
if
the
bail
was
jumped.
that
type
of
value
is
very
speculative,
most
of
them
were
picked
up
by
police
officials
and
brought
back
to
the
court,
that
is
where
the
bail
bonds
did
not
go
through
really
any
expense
that
way.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
i
think
it
is
universal
--
mr.
james
a.
rooney
yes,
i
think,
it
is
universal
throughout
the
court
system
in
the
united
states.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
i
do
not
know
how
else
the
state
of
illinois
can
function
still
having
a
100%
system.
if
you
take
the
10%
fee,
you
will
have
10%
system
with
no
fee
and
it
will
be
mandatory
as
of
right
now.
so
what
that
will
mean,
is
that
after
a
judge
finds
that
a
reasonable
amount
of
bond
will
be
100%,
it
will
be
allowed
down
on
10%
and
we
can
go
in
abrogation
of
the
judges
discretion
in
setting
by.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
correct.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
oh,
yes,
and
the
100%
and
10%
it
is
up
to
the
defendant.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
but
on
the
recognizance
—
mr.
james
a.
rooney
that
is
the
recognizance
spot
of
what
we
in
illinois
call
the
i-bond.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
oh,
correct,
i
think
the
state
has
a
—
mr.
james
a.
rooney
it
is
not
utilized
that
way
mr.
justice.
in
closing,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
third
point
that
the
plaintiffs
raised
in
their
brief
and
that
is
that
no
bond
cost
can
be
imposed
on
any
person
who
has
found
innocent
and
they
rely
on
the
giaccio
case
and
in
the
giaccio
case
involved
court
cost
where
the
jury
was
given
the
option
really
of
punishing
a
person
after
they
found
him
innocent.
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
termed
this
an
administrative
cost,
but
i
do
not
think
the
inquiry
has
to
stop
there.
i
think
that,
as
was
suggested
earlier,
there
are
some
parts
of
our
society
that
do
not
function
perfectly
and
part
of
it
is
our
criminal
justice
system
and
of
course
there
are
going
to
be
mistakes
where
an
innocent
person,
we
do
find
innocent
people
and
those
people
unfortunately,
will
have
to
bear
this
type
of
cost
and
there
are
might
be
a
type
of
remedy
if
the
state
has
absolutely
no
justification
for
picking
them
up
just
like
the
–
in
element
of
damages
in
the
civil
rights
actions
or
in
a
false
imprisonment
action,
but
it
is
not
the
type
of
situation
that
should
be
brought
up
here
really
on
a
kind
of
class
action.
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
there
was
no
allegation
in
this
that
anybody
was
indigent,
there
is
no
motion
for
reduction
of
bond,
there
is
no
motion
for
release
on
recognizance
and
if
the
case
is
here
and
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
is
really
sewing
on
the
head
of
indigent
people,
we
do
not
know
really
anything
about
him.
there
is
a
stipulation
of
facts,
but
the
--
it
is
very
sketchy.
it
is
from
down
state
illinois,
our
office
did
not
participate
in
it,
but
one
of
the
real
problems
is
that
john
schilb
might
have
been
one
of
these
people
who
made
an
intelligent
decision.
he
had
the
money,
but
he
added
up
in
the
interest
rates
and
came
out
and
says,
i
will
put
down
the
10%
and
i
think
that
if
the
bond
was
excessive
in
this
case,
it
should
have
been
tested
the
general
way
by
habeas
corpus
on
motion
for
reduction
of
bond.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
i
think
the
fact
that
the
state
of
illinois
is
granting
to
these
people
a
substantial
benefit
which
they
did
not
have
before
and
also
pursuing
a
valid
purpose
in
eliminating
the
bondsman
from
the
court
system
justify
as
the
imposition
of
this
type
of
cost
and
this
quest.
they
were
the
ones
who
had
to
go
to
the
bondsmen
before
and
they
are
the
ones
who
had
to
pay
the
10%
before,
we
are
letting
them
out
on
a
cost
of
1%.
we
think
that
is
sufficient
to
designate
that
class
as
the
one
to
bear
the
cost.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
yes.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
it
is
an
interesting
situation,
we
have
the
same
type
of
class
action
pending
in
cook
county
and
we
felt
that
we
had
a
quite
an
interest
in
this
case
because
we
handle
much
of
the
criminal
litigation
in
cook
county
and
there
is
a
possibility
of
loss
right
now
of
$2,500,000
to
cook
county
through
a
refund
of
this
type
of
a
payment.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
st.
clair
county
i
believe
was
going
to
be
here,
but
they
called
me
and
said
they
did
not
–
they
are
abidingly
interested.
they
asked
our
office
to
handle
the
deal
fr
them.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
the
best
way
to
understand
why
the
illinois
10%
deposit
provisions
are
constitutional
to
take
a
look
at
what
we
had
in
illinois
before
they
were
passed.
prior
to
1963,
when
the
whole
bail
procedure
in
illinois
was
overhauled,
we
had
two
ways
of
getting
out
of
the
jail
once
bailed
had
been
set.
first
of
all,
you
had
a
release
on
recognizance
which
was
not
utilized,
that
was
perhaps
cured,
perhaps
not
cured
if
the
release
on
recognizance
is
doubled
in
illinois
since
the
bail
reform
statute
went
through.
it
has
doubled.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
the
number
released
on
recognizance
has
double
and
it
is
still
not
an
extremely
large
percent.
but
we
still
have
to
release
on
recognizance.
the
only
other
way
you
can
get
out
prior
to
1963
was
either
to
have
yourself
or
somebody
else
for
you
pledge
the
full
amount
of
the
bond.
now
because
you
have
to
pledge
the
full
amount
of
the
bond,
there
were
defacto
three
categories
of
people.
there
were
the
rich
who
could
put
up
the
full
amount
of
the
bond,
there
were
those
who
could
not
put
up
the
full
amount
of
the
bond
but
could
go
to
the
bondsman
to
pay
his
fee
and
get
out
that
way,
and
then
there
were
who
really
--
the
truly
indigent
who
just
did
not
have
the
money
even
to
go
to
the
bondsman,
they
have
to
stay
in
jail,
attending
the
trial
of
their
case.
now,
i
think
there
is
a
difference
of
opinion
as
to
the
purposes
of
110-7,
the
10%
bail
deposit
provisions.
they
were,
first
of
all,
designed
to
get
rid
of
the
bail
bondsman
in
illinois.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
the
10%,
usually
cash.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
the
statute
says
that,
money,
it
is
all.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
it
has
to
be
cash.
the
other
purpose
of
the
bail
reform
act
110-7
was
to
reduce
the
financial
imposition
on
those
who
had
to
go
to
the
bail
bondsman.
now,
the
reason
why
to
get
rid
of
the
bail
bondsman
is
fairly
obvious,
they
have
been
the
villains
for
all
the
legal
journals
over
the
last
20
year.
there
were
all
sorts
of
abuses
including
some
scandals
that
unfortunately
involved
judges
and
the
assistant
state
attorneys
in
cook
county
and
throughout
the
state
of
illinois
but
that
does
not
mean
that
bail
bondsman
should
still
be
around
just
because
we
had
judges
and
assistant
states
attorneys
involved.
the
big
problem
was
that,
by
statute
in
illinois,
a
bail
bondsman
could
charge
10%.
now,
that
was
suppose
to
be
the
maximum
limit
that
bail
bondsman
could
charge
but
unfortunately
in
things
like
this,
that
became
the
minimum
and
it
finally
got
to
the
place
where
the
bail
bondsman,
not
the
judge,
held
accused
to
the
jail
in
many
cases
because
if
you
are
unable
to
post
the
full
amount
of
the
bond
and
you
want
to
go
to
see
the
bail
bondsman,
the
bail
bondsman
will
take
a
look
at
you
and
you
will
decide
whether
or
not
you
are
a
good
risk.
if
you
are
not
at
good
risk,
the
price
went
up
and
so
10%
was
the
beginning
of
the
bargaining.
now
other
scandals
that
involved
the
bail
bondsman
having
judgments
vacated
and
not
returning
the
pledges
to
the
defendants,
and
of
course
the
way
they
got
the
defendants
back
to
the
courtroom
if
the
bond
had
been
jumped
was
notorious.
so,
what
the
illinois
legislature
wanted
to
do
is
first
of
all,
get
rid
of
the
bail
bondsman,
second
of
all,
make
it
a
little
bit
less
expensive
for
those
who
are
not
exercising
a
constitutional
right
but
exercising
really
statutory
right
to
get
out.
when
you
went
to
the
bail
bondsman,
you
put
down
the
amount
of
your
bail,
excuse
me,
the
10%
with
him,
the
statutory
amount
and
then
the
bail
bondsman
all
he
did
was
was
sign
a
bond,
he
did
not
have
to
put
down
any
money
because
he
had
money
down
in
his
bank,
that
is
the
way
it
worked.
but
when
you
put
down
that
10%,
that
is
the
less
you
saw
that
--
no
matter
whether
you
were
innocent,
not-guilty,
you
forfeited
10%
of
the
amount
of
your
bond.
now,
i
think
a
question
was
asked,
where
do
we
get
the
10%
and
the
1%?
mr.
james
a.
rooney
the
purpose
of
the
1%
is
to
cover
basically
the
expenses
of
the
clerk
in
writing
the
bonds,
keeping
records
on
the
bonds,
returning
forfeited
bonds—it
is
a
big
operation.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
it
is
not
charged
to
the
man
who
puts
a
100%
down
because
we
feel
that
he
is
exercising
a
constitutional
right.
we
feel
that
the
constitutional
right
is
the
right
to
a
reasonable
amount
of
bond.
now,
the
man
who
gets
the
100%
bond,
he
is
exercising
a
constitutional
right
to
what
his
reasonable
amount
would
be.
a
man
is
exercising
the
10%
right
is
exercising
a
statutory
right
which
we
feel
--
we
are
not
letting
him
out
on
reasonable
amount
of
bond,
we
are
letting
him
out
on
10%
of
what
a
reasonable
amount
would
be.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
it
makes
it
harder
to
justify
those
who
are
on
their
on
recognizance.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
we
think
they
are
little
differently
situated
than
those—
mr.
james
a.
rooney
no,
not
expense
wise
to
the
system
but
before
you
are
released
on
recognizance,
the
judge
makes
a
a
defacto
but
rather
extensive
look
into
your
background
and
we
think
that
these
type
of
defendants,
since
it
is
more
likely
that
they
will
show
up
and
it
is
all
relative,
the
sort
of
discretionary
with
the
judge
,
the
release
on
recognizance,
since
they
more
likely
to
show
up
do
we
think
that
there
is
sufficiently,
differently
situated
as
not
to
charge
them.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
i
do
not
believe
so.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
the
cost
of
the
state
is
across
the
board
and
in
the
stipulation
of
facts
when
we
process
a
bond
where
there
are
securities
or
mortgage
and
the
un-
mortgaged
real
estate
are
put
down,
there
is
perhaps
a
slightly
greater
expense
to
the
state
then
when
just
cash
is
put
down
under
the
10%
--
mr.
james
a.
rooney
not--
mr.
james
a.
rooney
no,
it
is
unique.
illinois
is
unique
in
charging
a
1%,
so
you
have
a
total
(voice
overlap)
mr.
james
a.
rooney
well,
a
good
example
is
the
federal
statute.
in
the
federal
statute,
it
is
up
to
the
discretion
of
the
judge
whether
he
lets
you
out
at
a
100%
or
10%.
now,
there
are
all
sorts
of
other
conditions
you
can
put
on
your
bond.
in
illinois,
the
legislatures
limited
the
discretion
of
the
judges
to
releasing
a
man
on
his
recognizance
or
setting
a
dollar
amount
of
bail.
the
legislature
has
not
vested
the
judge
with
that
type
of
discretion,
perhaps
by
an
amount
of
10%,
perhaps
not
by
the
amount
of
10%.
once
he
sets
the
amount,
it
is
automatic.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
correct.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
only
one.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
correct.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
no,
because
we
are
giving
them
a
special
benefit.
we
are
releasing
them
at
10%
of
the
amount
of
the
reasonable
bond.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
yes,
we
could.
that
is
not
utilized.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
well,
i
did
not
perhaps
understand
it
that
way.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
correct
and
as
i
try
to
explain,
i
believe
that
is
because
judges
made
a
determination
before
we
get
to
that
point
that
he
is
substantially
different.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
correct.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
correct,
absolutely
right.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
yes,
he
just
signs
a
bond
promising
that
he
will
show
up.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
he
forfeits
the
face
amount
of
the
bond.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
well,
it
depends
on
the
type
of
the
offense.
the
judge
sets
what
the
amount
of
bond
would
be
except
for
the
fact
the
he
feels
this
accused
person
is
a
type
of
person
who
is
most
likely
to
show
up
for
trial
and
therefore
the
state
will
not
have
to
go
to
additional
expense
of
going
out
and
looking
for
him
and
bringing
him
to
trial.
one
of
the
problems
with
the
bail
bond
system
was
that
the
bail
bonds,
it
was
not
the
man
that
returned
to
defendant
if
the
bail
was
jumped.
that
type
of
value
is
very
speculative,
most
of
them
were
picked
up
by
police
officials
and
brought
back
to
the
court,
that
is
where
the
bail
bonds
did
not
go
through
really
any
expense
that
way.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
i
think
it
is
universal
--
mr.
james
a.
rooney
yes,
i
think,
it
is
universal
throughout
the
court
system
in
the
united
states.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
i
do
not
know
how
else
the
state
of
illinois
can
function
still
having
a
100%
system.
if
you
take
the
10%
fee,
you
will
have
10%
system
with
no
fee
and
it
will
be
mandatory
as
of
right
now.
so
what
that
will
mean,
is
that
after
a
judge
finds
that
a
reasonable
amount
of
bond
will
be
100%,
it
will
be
allowed
down
on
10%
and
we
can
go
in
abrogation
of
the
judges
discretion
in
setting
by.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
correct.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
oh,
yes,
and
the
100%
and
10%
it
is
up
to
the
defendant.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
but
on
the
recognizance
—
mr.
james
a.
rooney
that
is
the
recognizance
spot
of
what
we
in
illinois
call
the
i-bond.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
oh,
correct,
i
think
the
state
has
a
—
mr.
james
a.
rooney
it
is
not
utilized
that
way
mr.
justice.
in
closing,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
third
point
that
the
plaintiffs
raised
in
their
brief
and
that
is
that
no
bond
cost
can
be
imposed
on
any
person
who
has
found
innocent
and
they
rely
on
the
giaccio
case
and
in
the
giaccio
case
involved
court
cost
where
the
jury
was
given
the
option
really
of
punishing
a
person
after
they
found
him
innocent.
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
termed
this
an
administrative
cost,
but
i
do
not
think
the
inquiry
has
to
stop
there.
i
think
that,
as
was
suggested
earlier,
there
are
some
parts
of
our
society
that
do
not
function
perfectly
and
part
of
it
is
our
criminal
justice
system
and
of
course
there
are
going
to
be
mistakes
where
an
innocent
person,
we
do
find
innocent
people
and
those
people
unfortunately,
will
have
to
bear
this
type
of
cost
and
there
are
might
be
a
type
of
remedy
if
the
state
has
absolutely
no
justification
for
picking
them
up
just
like
the
–
in
element
of
damages
in
the
civil
rights
actions
or
in
a
false
imprisonment
action,
but
it
is
not
the
type
of
situation
that
should
be
brought
up
here
really
on
a
kind
of
class
action.
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
there
was
no
allegation
in
this
that
anybody
was
indigent,
there
is
no
motion
for
reduction
of
bond,
there
is
no
motion
for
release
on
recognizance
and
if
the
case
is
here
and
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
is
really
sewing
on
the
head
of
indigent
people,
we
do
not
know
really
anything
about
him.
there
is
a
stipulation
of
facts,
but
the
--
it
is
very
sketchy.
it
is
from
down
state
illinois,
our
office
did
not
participate
in
it,
but
one
of
the
real
problems
is
that
john
schilb
might
have
been
one
of
these
people
who
made
an
intelligent
decision.
he
had
the
money,
but
he
added
up
in
the
interest
rates
and
came
out
and
says,
i
will
put
down
the
10%
and
i
think
that
if
the
bond
was
excessive
in
this
case,
it
should
have
been
tested
the
general
way
by
habeas
corpus
on
motion
for
reduction
of
bond.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
i
think
the
fact
that
the
state
of
illinois
is
granting
to
these
people
a
substantial
benefit
which
they
did
not
have
before
and
also
pursuing
a
valid
purpose
in
eliminating
the
bondsman
from
the
court
system
justify
as
the
imposition
of
this
type
of
cost
and
this
quest.
they
were
the
ones
who
had
to
go
to
the
bondsmen
before
and
they
are
the
ones
who
had
to
pay
the
10%
before,
we
are
letting
them
out
on
a
cost
of
1%.
we
think
that
is
sufficient
to
designate
that
class
as
the
one
to
bear
the
cost.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
yes.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
it
is
an
interesting
situation,
we
have
the
same
type
of
class
action
pending
in
cook
county
and
we
felt
that
we
had
a
quite
an
interest
in
this
case
because
we
handle
much
of
the
criminal
litigation
in
cook
county
and
there
is
a
possibility
of
loss
right
now
of
$2,500,000
to
cook
county
through
a
refund
of
this
type
of
a
payment.
mr.
james
a.
rooney
st.
clair
county
i
believe
was
going
to
be
here,
but
they
called
me
and
said
they
did
not
–
they
are
abidingly
interested.
they
asked
our
office
to
handle
the
deal
fr
them.
