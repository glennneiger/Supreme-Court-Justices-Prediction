we

arguments

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
just
protest
this
event
for
a
moment
that
we
can
clear
this
counsel?
mr.
o’toole,
you
may
now
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
motion
is
granted
for
the
purpose
of
this
case,
so
you
may
proceed
mr.
o’toole.
chief

not
necessarily
true.
a
man
might
be
in
business
and
want
to
keep
his
cash,
keep
his
cash
flow
position
very
liquid.
so,
instead
of
buying
a
bond,
he
put
up
the
10%
even
though
he
had
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
in
the
bank.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
going
back
to
hypothetical,
if
someone
opposes,
do
you
require,
i
would
like
to
get
your
answer
again,
suppose
the
statute
provided
for
a
$25
fee
for
everyone
for
administrative
override,
where
they
released
on
its
own
recognizance,
where
they
released
on
a
bail
bond
or
they
released
on
10%
or
a
100%
what
about
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
by
definition
of
the
indigents,
for
all
practical
purposes
has
a
waiver
(voice
overlap)
which
you
cannot
(inaudible)
as
it
were,
then
you
would
say
it
is
invalid
as
to
the
person
ultimately
found
innocent.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
what
theory
is
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
constitutional
theory?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
going
back
to
the
preposition
i
suggested
before
and
let
me
make
a
variation
of
it,
suppose
a
man
had
a
million
dollars
in
the
bank
and
they
fix
$100,000
as
bail,
now
he
has
got
that
money
out
earning
interest,
is
he
likely
to
put
up
the
100%
or
is
he
likely
to
put
up
10%?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(voice
overlap)
it
is
arithmetic
and
common
sense
to
put
up
10%.
so
it
is
not
a
poor-man
rich-man
argument
really
at
all,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
rooney,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
certainly
the
cost
to
the
state
is
across
the
board,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
any
given
time
do
you
know
what
is
the
balance
or
the
average
balance
in
all
of
the
accounts
maintained
to
this
10%?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
interest?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh
no,
i
mean
in
interest,
this
money
whether
it
is
a
100%
or
10%
is
put
in
the
bank
i
assume,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
assume
also
if
we
put
it
in
the
bank
it
pays
interest.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
let
us
assume
4%,
that
is
quite
a
lot
of
money
that
is
coming
in.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
any
information
of
how
many
people
who
have
put
up
a
100%
in
money?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
100%
money
be
in
money
or
real
estate?
chief
