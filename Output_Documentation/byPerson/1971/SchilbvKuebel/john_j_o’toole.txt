mr.
john
j.
o’toole
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
moved
that
james
a.
rooney
be
permitted
to
argue
pro
hac
vice
on
behalf
of
the
appellee
in
this
case,
he
is
a
member
in
good
standing
of
the
bar
of
illinois
but
he
has
not
been
a
member
for
more
than
three
years.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
in
1963,
75th
general
assembly
of
the
state
of
illinois
revamped
our
entire
bail
procedure,
and
they
did
this
for
two-fold
reasons
and
the
main
and
the
most
important
one
was
to
assure
that
all
persons
regardless
of
their
financial
status
would
not
be
unnecessarily
detained
a
waiting
trial.
as
an
ancillary
blessing
of
the
system
we
have
practically
eliminated
the
bondsman
system
in
the
state
of
illinois.
basically,
what
this
legislation
did
was
to
enable
a
person
accused
of
a
crime
to
gain
his
pretrial
freedom
in
one
of
the
three
manners,
under
110-2
he
could
make
an
application
for
release
on
his
recognizance,
under
110-8
he
could
post
the
full
amount
of
the
bond,
i
mean
the
bail
set
by
the
court
in
either
cash,
stocks,
bonds
or
real
estate
in
double
the
value,
or
he
could
deposit
10%
of
the
full
amount
of
bail
under
110-7
and
all
of
this
was
very
good
and
has
been
very
effective.
but
in
doing
so,
they
put
in
one
anachronism
and
that
is
they
impose
a
cost
on
the
individuals
who
are
released
under
110-7,
those
that
make
a
deposit
of
10%
of
the
full
amount
of
bail.
in
this
case,
john
schilb
and
all
those
other
similarly
situate
sought
and
received
their
release
under
110-7
and
they
were
all
charged
a
10%
bail
cost
upon
their
release
or
conviction.
now
we
contend
that
this
imposition
of
a
cost
on
this
one
segment
is
unconstitutional
for
all
of
the
people
involved
here
seek
one
end
and
that
is
to
be
released
so
they
could
prepare
for
trial
and
not
to
be
subject
to
pretrial
incarceration,
yet
they
impose
the
burden
of
supporting
the
entire
system
on
one
segment
of
that
class.
the
second--
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
oh
no,
i
think
there
is
--
as
the
argument
develops
mr.
justice
blackmun,
you
will
see
that
if
there
was
an
over
across
the
board
imposition
of
the
cost,
i
would
still
alleged
that
it
would
be
not
proper
in
that
it
could
never
be
imposed
upon
indigents,
true
indigents,
nor
could
it
ever
be
imposed
upon
a
man
who
is
found
innocent.
so,
just
across
the
board
statute
i
do
not
think
would
solve
our
judges
--
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
i
think
it
would
be
wrong,
when
it
became
to
a
true
indigent
or
to
a
person
that
was
innocent.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
right.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
that
is
part
of
our
contention
before
this
court,
where
it
is
not
only
this
class
aspect
where
we
say
one
segment
is
segregated
out
in
burden.
but
in
addition
to
that,
we
also
contend
that
these
people
who
put
up
the
10%
simply
cannot
afford
the
full
amount
of
bail
and
they
are
penalized
in
their
quest
for
justice
in
contrary
to
the
long
line
of
cases
since
griffin
versus
illinois.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
oh
yes,
your
honor.
i
buy
this
fully
that
that
statement
was
not
meant
to
be
a
universal.
i
think
the
statistics
will
bear
out
which
we
have
cited
some
in
our
brief
that
as
the
amount
of
bail
goes
up,
the
ability
to
make
the
full
bond
decreases
sharply
and
whereas
some
people
might
choose
to
only
put
up
the
10%.
the
fact
is,
that
he
has
a
choice
but
what
about
that
large
segment
of
our
population?
and
actually
this
is
a
moderately
poor,
the
working
man,
who
just
does
not
have
a
sufficient
assets
to
make
that
choice.
he
has
no
choice,
he
has
to
go
in
and
make
the
deposit
and
then
he
is
subjected
to
the
burden
of
supporting
the
whole
system.
it
is
not
his
choice.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
yes,
yes
your
honor—that
was
an
element.
but
then,
if
it
is
unconstitutional
to
even
impose
it
on
one
person,
i
think
the
whole
statute--
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
no,
i
will
agree.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
a
true
indigent
is
helped
in
one
way,
by
110-7.
and
he
is
harmed
in
one
way
by
110-7f
which
is
the
cross
provision.
if
i
were
a
true
indigent,
i
would
have
a
far
better
chance
of
borrowing
the
money
if
i
could
signed
the
back
of
that
bond
receipt
and
the
one
who
lends
it
on
me
was
willing
to
get
full
amount
back.
as
it
is
now,
he
only
gets
90%
of
it.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
oh,
i
agree
with
you,
your
honor.
we
are
talking
about
the
people
who
are
relative.
bail--
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
no,
actually
not
indigents
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
i
do
not
think
they
can
do
it
if
they
do
it
in
an
equal
manner.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
excuse
me
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
i
do
not
think
that
they
have
the
power.
i
think
that
the
way
that
it
is
set
up
here
is
that,
it
is
just
not
constitutionally
permissible.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
on
the
10%?
i
do
not
think
that
it
could
be
practically
segregated
out
to
a
question
of
proof
in
each
case
if
an
individual
actually
had
the
option,
but
the
question
remains
that
as
long
as
all
people
do
not
have
a
choice,
this
is
their
only
means
of
getting
out
on
bail,
they
should
not
be
charged
with
the
burdens.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
right
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
not
at
all.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
right
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
are
charged
no
fee.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
that
is
right.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
10%
of
the
10%
or
a
net
of
1%.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
i
would
answer
the
question
in
the
same
manner,
mr.
chief
justice
and
that
would
be
that
i
think
that
it
would
valid
as
to
all
except
the
true
indigent
and
except
to
those
that
are
found
innocent.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
right
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
well
the
theory
of
that
is
what—
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
constitutional
theory.
this
court
entered
a
decision
in
1966
in
giaccio
versus
pennsylvania
in
which
a
jury
in
pennsylvania
was
permitted
at
the
finding
of
a
person
innocent
to
impose
court
trust.
and
that
the
court
in
majority
opinion
held
that
the
statute
was
vague.
but
the
concurring
opinion
of
mr.
justice
stewart
stated
that
in
his
opinion,
it
was
a
violation
of
due
process,
rudimentary
due
process,
and
i
think
that
that
is
the
law
of
the
land
and
that
should
be
the
law
in
regard
to
this
case,
that
in
no
manner
can
anybody
impose
a
cost
attended
to
a
criminal
proceeding
and
individual
found
innocent.
and
if
there
is
any
question
as
to
whether
that
is
an
integral
part
of
a
proceeding
is
probably
the
most
important
aspect
because
it
affects
the
man’s
family,
it
affects
the
outcome
of
the
trial
or
it
affects
the
severity
of
a
sentence,
unduly
burdens
of
man,
he
losses
his
job
and
that—
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
i
agree
with
you
mr.
justice
stewart
that
there
are
other
costs
that
are
created
by
our
society.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
right.
but
this
is
not
created
by
our
society.
this
is
created
by
our
legislature.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
it
is
a
cost
that's
imminent
to
that
proceeding.
the
interesting
thing
to
note
too
in
relation
to
that
cost
is
that
prior
to
enactment
of
this
new
act
when
we
had
the
bondsman,
the
court
perform
the
same
service,
handled
the
same
paper
and
never
charged
anybody
anything.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
no.
but
now,
the
legislation—
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
that
is
right
your
honor.
but
basically,
i
believed,
that
the
difference
here
is
that
we
cannot
remedy
the
aspect
of
the
social
evil
but
we
can
remedy
this
cost.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
oh
no,
your
honor,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
that
is
farthest
thing
we
want
to
make
that
eminently
clear,
we
believe
this
to
be
very
good
legislation.
we
feel
this
aspect
of
it
is
wrong
and
definitely
not,
there
would
not
be
any
reincarnation
of
the
bondsman.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
the
same
place
they
got
it
before
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
back
into
old
system,
on
the
bond
forfeitures,
they
realized
x
balance.
today,
under
out
statute,
our
sheriff,
our
state’s
attorney
is
required
to
collect
bond
forfeitures
and
they
go
after
people
that
do
jump
bond
and
that
if
a
person
had
the
full
amount
of
bail
up
or
he
has
got
10%
up,
right
at
that
point
you
have
costs
coming
in
or
cost
reimbursement.
in
addition
to
that,
it
is
quite
a
record
in
the
very
foundation,
the
columbia
bail
study
and
various
other
findings
that
the
local
and
state
and
federal
governments
are
saving
millions
and
millions
of
dollars
a
year
due
to
the
fact
that
when
we
have
enlightened
legislation
such
as
this
that
the
jail
population
slips
significantly
and
that
our
fewer
people
incarcerated
waiting
trial.
now
—
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
i
will
only
say
that
we
are
having
trouble
in
the
area
of
a
true
indigent
and
i
still
feel
that
this
is
cost
attending—
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
that
is
right
your
honor.
the
true
indigent,
there
is
no
problem
in
that
area.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
well,
i
believe
this
was
the
idea
behind
it,
is
that
at
the
time
or
prior
to
the
enactment
of
legislation
under
the
bondsman
system,
an
individual
could
give
the
bondsman
10%,
the
bondsman
in
most
cases
would
retain
the
entire
10%.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
believe
basically,
it
was
a
question
that
they
felt
if
they
were
--
if
these
people
were
paying
a
charge
to
the
bondsman,
they
can
pay
a
charge
to
the
clerk,
a
charge
which
was
never
imposed
on
them
before,
but
there
is
one
basic
difference
in
that
too,
is
that
our
clerk
does
not
assume
liability
for
any
bail
jumping
as
the
bondsman
did.
and
there
the
cost
was
justified
by
a
possible
liability.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
mr.
justice
brennan,
in
the
state
of
illinois
it
is
10%
flat,
no
discretion
in
the
court
at
all.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
if
he
has--
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
right,
if
he
has
the
necessary
funds.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
yes,
that
is
right
your
honor,
that
there
are
a
couple
of
offenses
in
the
state
of
illinois
which
are
not
bailable.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
i
do
not
know
what
that
individual
would
do
perhaps
he
would
elect
to
put
up
the
10%.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
well,
i
think
when
you
get
into
the
poor-man
rich-man
area
mr.
chief
justice,
this
court
--
in
a
bail
application
mr.
justice
douglas
said,
that
having
that
poverty
in
the
area
of
bail
is
merely
whether
you
have
enough
money
to
pledge
for
your
freedom.
this
was
recognized
by
our
former
chief
justice
in
a
speech
before
the
national
bail
conference
also,
that
when
it
comes
to
bail,
the
question
of
poverty
is
a
relative
concept.
it
might
bond
as
a
thousand
dollars
and
i
have
900.
i
am
a
poor
man
because
i
am
going
to
be
incarcerated
waiting
trial,
that
is
the
concept.
also,
we
have
to
take
into
–
a
factor
i
could
you
an
example
saying
the
state
of
illinois
that
if
an
individual
owned
a
larg
ebuilding
with
a
million
dollars
and
he
had
a
mortgage
of
a
100,000,
he
could
not
pledge
that
on
a
real
estate
bond
because
our
statute
requires
unencumbered,
that
he
would
be
relatively
poor
as
far
as
that
was
concerned
and
he
would
have
no
choice
as
to
whether
he
was
going
to
deposit
full
or
10%.
we
feel
that
that
it
is
very
clear
from
(inaudible)
that
the
one
segment
is
definitely
discriminated
against.
we
feel
the
relative
is
poor
discriminated
against
and
we
feel
that
this
is
a
cost
pertinent
to
a
criminal
proceeding
which
should
not
be
recognizance.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
yes,
there
is
something
in
the
history.
the
committee
that
recommended
the
legislature
that
this
bail
reform
act
be
adopted
found
that,
first
of
all,
there
was
a
10%
charge
as
the
bail
bondsman
charge
and
that
the
general
bond
forfeiture
rate
brought
into
the
state
1%.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
out
of
all
the
bonds
that
are
forfeited,
almost
all
of
them
were
written
by
bail
bondsman
at
that
time.
we
got
a
return
of
1%
of
the
amount
of
money,
so
that
is
why
they
chose
the
1%.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
the
average
balance,
i
can
tell
you
how
much
the
state
ends
up
making
each
year
in
cook
county.
in
cook
county,
we
end
up
making
about
$1,250,000
a
year.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
in
1%.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
i
assume
so.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
our
public
officials
would
be
--
were
missing
their
duty
if
they
did
not
put
it
in
that
type
of
an
account.
i
do
not
know
what
the
--
i
guess
the
interest
would
be
1,250,000
times
whatever
the
prevailing
bank
rate
would
be.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
that
would
be
12,
12
million.
12,500,000
over
a
year.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
i
do
not
know
what
the
cash
flow
is
and
how
much
we
do
have
in
the
accounts
at
any
given
moment.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
yes
it
is,
but
i
tried
to
do
some
research
on
how
much
it
costs
the
state
to
process
all
the
bonds
and
it
was
rather
a
few.
i
could
find
out
that
certain
departments
that
are
concerned
only
with
bonds,
the
two
departments
i
am
talking
about
are
those
that
once
the
bonds
are
executed
are
responsible
for
keeping
track
of
them
and
that
the
bond
refund
section
and
those
two
sections,
the
expenses
around
each
year
are
about
$415,000.
this
does
not
count
at
all,
the
salaries
of
people
who
write
bonds
and
that
is
hard
to
find
out
because
some
are
written
at
the
police
station
by
policeman,
some
are
written
by
clerks
in
the
courts,
and
we
just
could
not
find
the
figures
on
it,
we
tried.
now,
the
difference
between
1963
and
now
is
that
illinois
is
granting
a
substantial
benefit
to
those
same
people
who
would
have
to
go
to
the
bail
bondsman.
the
indigents
still
have
to
sit
in
jail.
but
there
is
certain
group,
just
sort
of
medium
group
between
being
able
to
put
up
the
100%
and
going
to
the
bail
bondsman.
but
they
do
not
have
to
go
to
the
bail
bondsman
and
pay
10%.
now
what
illinois
has
done
is,
let
us
say
you
got
a
bond
set
a
$100,
the
person
will
put
down
$10
and
be
released
and
the
state
would
charge
him
$1,
so
what
in
effect
has
happened
is
the
state
of
illinois
has
loaned
him
a
for
the
period
of
the
case,
no
matter
how
long
it
took
and
for
john
schilb
it
took
five
months,
they
have
loaned
him
$90
and
they
are
charging
a
$1
interest
for
the
term
of
the
case
and
no
bail
bondsman
can
match
that
and
that
is
the
really
the
reason
the
bail
bondsman
vanished
in
the
illinois
courts.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
yes
he
does
during
the
term
that
the
100%
is
put
up,
that
money
also
is
invested
just
like
the
10%.
he
is
not
making
a
contribution.
i
do
not
know
what
the
figures
on
that
also.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
correct,
he
does
not.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
yes,
in
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county,
90%
of
the
people
put
up
the
10%
bond.
about
10%
put
up
the
100%
and--
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
might
be
money
or
real
estate
or
bonds
or
bonds
or
securities.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
an
encumbered
real
estate.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
i
am
sure
although
we
have
got
quite
a
few
more
(inaudible).
the
reason
that
90%
of
the
people
put
up
the
10%
bond
rather
than
the
100%
bond
is
based
on
i
think
on
the
return
that
they
can
get.
there
are
a
lot
of
rich
people
who
would
much
rather
put
up
10%
and
have
the
other
90%
working
for
them
because
the
state
loans
money
at
such
a
fantastically
low
interest
rate.
so,
i
do
not
think
that
really
rich
man
poor
man
makes
much
difference
here
because
anybody
given
a
choice,
if
they
think
it
out,
will
put
up
the
1%.
for
those
poor
people,
the
state
is
loaning
the
money
at
such
a
fantastically
low
interest
rate
that
i
just
do
not
think
rich
man
poor
man
applies.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
the
recognizance
people,
as
i
tried
to
make
clear,
state
considers
them
substantially
different
than
the
people
who
required
the
money.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
but
there
are
also
different
type
of
individual
that
the
judge
would
not
have
let
them
out.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
no,
but
the
judge
has
to
make
that
type
of
determination.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
correct,
their
expenses
are
the
same
as
putting
up
cash
bond.
i
am
sorry
i
did
not
understand
the
question
which
you
asked.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
they
are
substantially
different
and
the
judges
made
a
decision
that
they
are
most
likely
to
return
to
the
court
and
therefore
they
need
not
to
be
burdened
with
this
type
of
expense
as
opposed
to
the
others.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
i
think
that
since
we
are
granting
to
this
people,
a
new
substantial
benefit—
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
the
way
i
justified
is
over
past
this
stream,
the
illinois
has
never
charged
people
out
on
the
recognizance
bond
—
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
well,
i
do
not
think
we
can
charge
them
because
they
are
exercising
their
constitutional
right
also.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
correct.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
that
is
an
official
designation.
there
are
three
types
of
bonds
i
know
are
really
high
bonds
of
which
are
personal
recognizance,
d-bonds
which
are
the
10%
bonds
and
c-bonds
which
are
bonds
when
a
man
has
posted
the
full
amount.
in
cook
county
when
we
found
that
where
the
petty
offenses,
where
the
amount
of
bail
is
$25
or
less,
nobody
posts
a
10%
bond.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
on
parking
tickets
there
is
a
different
type.
but
on
most
cases,
it
is
$25
to
a
minimum
of
$5.
we
have
also
found
that
once
you
get
over
$25
that
the
amount,
the
percentage
is
90%,
it
will
post
the
10%
and
10%
it
will
post
the
100%.
now,
other
that,
about
10%
to
post
to
the
100%
bond.
there
are
illinois
supreme
court
rule
which
govern
certain
types
of
offenses
where
the
illinois
supreme
court
by
rule
and
it
is
specified
in
the
bond
statutes
that
supreme
court
made
specified
by
rule.
the
supreme
court
specifies
$500
cash,
which
means
that
10%
is
not
available
to
them,
and
that
is
anomaly
and
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
put
that
in
mostly
on
traffic
offenses
and
i
believe
it
is
to
prevent
practices
of
setting
too
high
a
bond
by
speed
track
judges,
i
believe
that,
that
is
the
policy
and
i
do
not
really
understand
—
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
no,
there
was
an
argument
made
in
the
illinois
supreme
court
on
the
petition
for
re-hearing
that
perhaps
one
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
rules
would
govern
at
100%
should
have
been
posted
rather
than
the
10%.
that
petition
for
hearing
was
denied
by
the
county.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
i
believed
it
to
be
your
honor.
the
supreme
has
passed
and
said
the
10%
would
properly
apply
here.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
just
wish
to
make
a
few
observations.
initially,
the
issue
here
is
the
constitutionality
of
that
cost
retention
provision.
this
system
will
go
on
regardless
of
whether
this
discriminatory
imposition
of
a
burden
on
one
segment
is
gone
away
with
their
net
or
if
i
can
answer,
i
believe
it
was
mr.
justice
marshall,
where
did
the
1%
figure
come
from?
it
came
from
the
fact
that
they
got
1%
on
forfeitures
from
bondsmen.
today,
they
equate
very
close
to
that
1%
on
forfeitures
and
bail
jumping
where
people
deposit
10%
and
they
deposit
the
full
amount.
they
are
getting
the
same
amount
of
money
that
they
got
before,
the
only
thing
they
are
doing
today
is
they
are
charging
one
segment
across
where
they
never
charged
them
--
across
anybody
across
before.
that
is
basically
what
it
is.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
well,
basically.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
that
man
did
not
lose
at
all,
i
agree
with
you
that
they
had
improved
the
system,
there
is
no
doubt
about
it,
but
the
difference
between
the
clerk
and
the
bondsman
is,
the
clerk
is
not
having
an
undertaking
to
pay
the
full
amount
if
the
guy
jumps
bail.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
or
it
all
go
onto
the
country
treasury,
but
the
county
is
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
no,
they
are
not,
definitely
not.
we
do
not
want
that.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
they
do
not
think
that
they
should
pay
anything
because
nobody
is
paying
for
it.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
(inaudible)
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
what
other
states?
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
how
they
were
released?
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
does
the
district
of
columbis
not
leverage
10%
or
something
like
that?
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
moved
that
james
a.
rooney
be
permitted
to
argue
pro
hac
vice
on
behalf
of
the
appellee
in
this
case,
he
is
a
member
in
good
standing
of
the
bar
of
illinois
but
he
has
not
been
a
member
for
more
than
three
years.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
in
1963,
75th
general
assembly
of
the
state
of
illinois
revamped
our
entire
bail
procedure,
and
they
did
this
for
two-fold
reasons
and
the
main
and
the
most
important
one
was
to
assure
that
all
persons
regardless
of
their
financial
status
would
not
be
unnecessarily
detained
a
waiting
trial.
as
an
ancillary
blessing
of
the
system
we
have
practically
eliminated
the
bondsman
system
in
the
state
of
illinois.
basically,
what
this
legislation
did
was
to
enable
a
person
accused
of
a
crime
to
gain
his
pretrial
freedom
in
one
of
the
three
manners,
under
110-2
he
could
make
an
application
for
release
on
his
recognizance,
under
110-8
he
could
post
the
full
amount
of
the
bond,
i
mean
the
bail
set
by
the
court
in
either
cash,
stocks,
bonds
or
real
estate
in
double
the
value,
or
he
could
deposit
10%
of
the
full
amount
of
bail
under
110-7
and
all
of
this
was
very
good
and
has
been
very
effective.
but
in
doing
so,
they
put
in
one
anachronism
and
that
is
they
impose
a
cost
on
the
individuals
who
are
released
under
110-7,
those
that
make
a
deposit
of
10%
of
the
full
amount
of
bail.
in
this
case,
john
schilb
and
all
those
other
similarly
situate
sought
and
received
their
release
under
110-7
and
they
were
all
charged
a
10%
bail
cost
upon
their
release
or
conviction.
now
we
contend
that
this
imposition
of
a
cost
on
this
one
segment
is
unconstitutional
for
all
of
the
people
involved
here
seek
one
end
and
that
is
to
be
released
so
they
could
prepare
for
trial
and
not
to
be
subject
to
pretrial
incarceration,
yet
they
impose
the
burden
of
supporting
the
entire
system
on
one
segment
of
that
class.
the
second--
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
oh
no,
i
think
there
is
--
as
the
argument
develops
mr.
justice
blackmun,
you
will
see
that
if
there
was
an
over
across
the
board
imposition
of
the
cost,
i
would
still
alleged
that
it
would
be
not
proper
in
that
it
could
never
be
imposed
upon
indigents,
true
indigents,
nor
could
it
ever
be
imposed
upon
a
man
who
is
found
innocent.
so,
just
across
the
board
statute
i
do
not
think
would
solve
our
judges
--
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
i
think
it
would
be
wrong,
when
it
became
to
a
true
indigent
or
to
a
person
that
was
innocent.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
right.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
that
is
part
of
our
contention
before
this
court,
where
it
is
not
only
this
class
aspect
where
we
say
one
segment
is
segregated
out
in
burden.
but
in
addition
to
that,
we
also
contend
that
these
people
who
put
up
the
10%
simply
cannot
afford
the
full
amount
of
bail
and
they
are
penalized
in
their
quest
for
justice
in
contrary
to
the
long
line
of
cases
since
griffin
versus
illinois.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
oh
yes,
your
honor.
i
buy
this
fully
that
that
statement
was
not
meant
to
be
a
universal.
i
think
the
statistics
will
bear
out
which
we
have
cited
some
in
our
brief
that
as
the
amount
of
bail
goes
up,
the
ability
to
make
the
full
bond
decreases
sharply
and
whereas
some
people
might
choose
to
only
put
up
the
10%.
the
fact
is,
that
he
has
a
choice
but
what
about
that
large
segment
of
our
population?
and
actually
this
is
a
moderately
poor,
the
working
man,
who
just
does
not
have
a
sufficient
assets
to
make
that
choice.
he
has
no
choice,
he
has
to
go
in
and
make
the
deposit
and
then
he
is
subjected
to
the
burden
of
supporting
the
whole
system.
it
is
not
his
choice.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
yes,
yes
your
honor—that
was
an
element.
but
then,
if
it
is
unconstitutional
to
even
impose
it
on
one
person,
i
think
the
whole
statute--
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
no,
i
will
agree.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
a
true
indigent
is
helped
in
one
way,
by
110-7.
and
he
is
harmed
in
one
way
by
110-7f
which
is
the
cross
provision.
if
i
were
a
true
indigent,
i
would
have
a
far
better
chance
of
borrowing
the
money
if
i
could
signed
the
back
of
that
bond
receipt
and
the
one
who
lends
it
on
me
was
willing
to
get
full
amount
back.
as
it
is
now,
he
only
gets
90%
of
it.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
oh,
i
agree
with
you,
your
honor.
we
are
talking
about
the
people
who
are
relative.
bail--
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
no,
actually
not
indigents
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
i
do
not
think
they
can
do
it
if
they
do
it
in
an
equal
manner.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
excuse
me
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
i
do
not
think
that
they
have
the
power.
i
think
that
the
way
that
it
is
set
up
here
is
that,
it
is
just
not
constitutionally
permissible.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
on
the
10%?
i
do
not
think
that
it
could
be
practically
segregated
out
to
a
question
of
proof
in
each
case
if
an
individual
actually
had
the
option,
but
the
question
remains
that
as
long
as
all
people
do
not
have
a
choice,
this
is
their
only
means
of
getting
out
on
bail,
they
should
not
be
charged
with
the
burdens.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
right
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
not
at
all.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
right
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
are
charged
no
fee.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
that
is
right.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
10%
of
the
10%
or
a
net
of
1%.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
i
would
answer
the
question
in
the
same
manner,
mr.
chief
justice
and
that
would
be
that
i
think
that
it
would
valid
as
to
all
except
the
true
indigent
and
except
to
those
that
are
found
innocent.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
right
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
well
the
theory
of
that
is
what—
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
constitutional
theory.
this
court
entered
a
decision
in
1966
in
giaccio
versus
pennsylvania
in
which
a
jury
in
pennsylvania
was
permitted
at
the
finding
of
a
person
innocent
to
impose
court
trust.
and
that
the
court
in
majority
opinion
held
that
the
statute
was
vague.
but
the
concurring
opinion
of
mr.
justice
stewart
stated
that
in
his
opinion,
it
was
a
violation
of
due
process,
rudimentary
due
process,
and
i
think
that
that
is
the
law
of
the
land
and
that
should
be
the
law
in
regard
to
this
case,
that
in
no
manner
can
anybody
impose
a
cost
attended
to
a
criminal
proceeding
and
individual
found
innocent.
and
if
there
is
any
question
as
to
whether
that
is
an
integral
part
of
a
proceeding
is
probably
the
most
important
aspect
because
it
affects
the
man’s
family,
it
affects
the
outcome
of
the
trial
or
it
affects
the
severity
of
a
sentence,
unduly
burdens
of
man,
he
losses
his
job
and
that—
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
i
agree
with
you
mr.
justice
stewart
that
there
are
other
costs
that
are
created
by
our
society.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
right.
but
this
is
not
created
by
our
society.
this
is
created
by
our
legislature.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
it
is
a
cost
that's
imminent
to
that
proceeding.
the
interesting
thing
to
note
too
in
relation
to
that
cost
is
that
prior
to
enactment
of
this
new
act
when
we
had
the
bondsman,
the
court
perform
the
same
service,
handled
the
same
paper
and
never
charged
anybody
anything.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
no.
but
now,
the
legislation—
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
that
is
right
your
honor.
but
basically,
i
believed,
that
the
difference
here
is
that
we
cannot
remedy
the
aspect
of
the
social
evil
but
we
can
remedy
this
cost.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
oh
no,
your
honor,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
that
is
farthest
thing
we
want
to
make
that
eminently
clear,
we
believe
this
to
be
very
good
legislation.
we
feel
this
aspect
of
it
is
wrong
and
definitely
not,
there
would
not
be
any
reincarnation
of
the
bondsman.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
the
same
place
they
got
it
before
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
back
into
old
system,
on
the
bond
forfeitures,
they
realized
x
balance.
today,
under
out
statute,
our
sheriff,
our
state’s
attorney
is
required
to
collect
bond
forfeitures
and
they
go
after
people
that
do
jump
bond
and
that
if
a
person
had
the
full
amount
of
bail
up
or
he
has
got
10%
up,
right
at
that
point
you
have
costs
coming
in
or
cost
reimbursement.
in
addition
to
that,
it
is
quite
a
record
in
the
very
foundation,
the
columbia
bail
study
and
various
other
findings
that
the
local
and
state
and
federal
governments
are
saving
millions
and
millions
of
dollars
a
year
due
to
the
fact
that
when
we
have
enlightened
legislation
such
as
this
that
the
jail
population
slips
significantly
and
that
our
fewer
people
incarcerated
waiting
trial.
now
—
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
i
will
only
say
that
we
are
having
trouble
in
the
area
of
a
true
indigent
and
i
still
feel
that
this
is
cost
attending—
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
that
is
right
your
honor.
the
true
indigent,
there
is
no
problem
in
that
area.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
well,
i
believe
this
was
the
idea
behind
it,
is
that
at
the
time
or
prior
to
the
enactment
of
legislation
under
the
bondsman
system,
an
individual
could
give
the
bondsman
10%,
the
bondsman
in
most
cases
would
retain
the
entire
10%.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
believe
basically,
it
was
a
question
that
they
felt
if
they
were
--
if
these
people
were
paying
a
charge
to
the
bondsman,
they
can
pay
a
charge
to
the
clerk,
a
charge
which
was
never
imposed
on
them
before,
but
there
is
one
basic
difference
in
that
too,
is
that
our
clerk
does
not
assume
liability
for
any
bail
jumping
as
the
bondsman
did.
and
there
the
cost
was
justified
by
a
possible
liability.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
mr.
justice
brennan,
in
the
state
of
illinois
it
is
10%
flat,
no
discretion
in
the
court
at
all.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
if
he
has--
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
right,
if
he
has
the
necessary
funds.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
yes,
that
is
right
your
honor,
that
there
are
a
couple
of
offenses
in
the
state
of
illinois
which
are
not
bailable.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
i
do
not
know
what
that
individual
would
do
perhaps
he
would
elect
to
put
up
the
10%.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
well,
i
think
when
you
get
into
the
poor-man
rich-man
area
mr.
chief
justice,
this
court
--
in
a
bail
application
mr.
justice
douglas
said,
that
having
that
poverty
in
the
area
of
bail
is
merely
whether
you
have
enough
money
to
pledge
for
your
freedom.
this
was
recognized
by
our
former
chief
justice
in
a
speech
before
the
national
bail
conference
also,
that
when
it
comes
to
bail,
the
question
of
poverty
is
a
relative
concept.
it
might
bond
as
a
thousand
dollars
and
i
have
900.
i
am
a
poor
man
because
i
am
going
to
be
incarcerated
waiting
trial,
that
is
the
concept.
also,
we
have
to
take
into
–
a
factor
i
could
you
an
example
saying
the
state
of
illinois
that
if
an
individual
owned
a
larg
ebuilding
with
a
million
dollars
and
he
had
a
mortgage
of
a
100,000,
he
could
not
pledge
that
on
a
real
estate
bond
because
our
statute
requires
unencumbered,
that
he
would
be
relatively
poor
as
far
as
that
was
concerned
and
he
would
have
no
choice
as
to
whether
he
was
going
to
deposit
full
or
10%.
we
feel
that
that
it
is
very
clear
from
(inaudible)
that
the
one
segment
is
definitely
discriminated
against.
we
feel
the
relative
is
poor
discriminated
against
and
we
feel
that
this
is
a
cost
pertinent
to
a
criminal
proceeding
which
should
not
be
recognizance.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
yes,
there
is
something
in
the
history.
the
committee
that
recommended
the
legislature
that
this
bail
reform
act
be
adopted
found
that,
first
of
all,
there
was
a
10%
charge
as
the
bail
bondsman
charge
and
that
the
general
bond
forfeiture
rate
brought
into
the
state
1%.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
out
of
all
the
bonds
that
are
forfeited,
almost
all
of
them
were
written
by
bail
bondsman
at
that
time.
we
got
a
return
of
1%
of
the
amount
of
money,
so
that
is
why
they
chose
the
1%.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
the
average
balance,
i
can
tell
you
how
much
the
state
ends
up
making
each
year
in
cook
county.
in
cook
county,
we
end
up
making
about
$1,250,000
a
year.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
in
1%.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
i
assume
so.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
our
public
officials
would
be
--
were
missing
their
duty
if
they
did
not
put
it
in
that
type
of
an
account.
i
do
not
know
what
the
--
i
guess
the
interest
would
be
1,250,000
times
whatever
the
prevailing
bank
rate
would
be.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
that
would
be
12,
12
million.
12,500,000
over
a
year.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
i
do
not
know
what
the
cash
flow
is
and
how
much
we
do
have
in
the
accounts
at
any
given
moment.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
yes
it
is,
but
i
tried
to
do
some
research
on
how
much
it
costs
the
state
to
process
all
the
bonds
and
it
was
rather
a
few.
i
could
find
out
that
certain
departments
that
are
concerned
only
with
bonds,
the
two
departments
i
am
talking
about
are
those
that
once
the
bonds
are
executed
are
responsible
for
keeping
track
of
them
and
that
the
bond
refund
section
and
those
two
sections,
the
expenses
around
each
year
are
about
$415,000.
this
does
not
count
at
all,
the
salaries
of
people
who
write
bonds
and
that
is
hard
to
find
out
because
some
are
written
at
the
police
station
by
policeman,
some
are
written
by
clerks
in
the
courts,
and
we
just
could
not
find
the
figures
on
it,
we
tried.
now,
the
difference
between
1963
and
now
is
that
illinois
is
granting
a
substantial
benefit
to
those
same
people
who
would
have
to
go
to
the
bail
bondsman.
the
indigents
still
have
to
sit
in
jail.
but
there
is
certain
group,
just
sort
of
medium
group
between
being
able
to
put
up
the
100%
and
going
to
the
bail
bondsman.
but
they
do
not
have
to
go
to
the
bail
bondsman
and
pay
10%.
now
what
illinois
has
done
is,
let
us
say
you
got
a
bond
set
a
$100,
the
person
will
put
down
$10
and
be
released
and
the
state
would
charge
him
$1,
so
what
in
effect
has
happened
is
the
state
of
illinois
has
loaned
him
a
for
the
period
of
the
case,
no
matter
how
long
it
took
and
for
john
schilb
it
took
five
months,
they
have
loaned
him
$90
and
they
are
charging
a
$1
interest
for
the
term
of
the
case
and
no
bail
bondsman
can
match
that
and
that
is
the
really
the
reason
the
bail
bondsman
vanished
in
the
illinois
courts.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
yes
he
does
during
the
term
that
the
100%
is
put
up,
that
money
also
is
invested
just
like
the
10%.
he
is
not
making
a
contribution.
i
do
not
know
what
the
figures
on
that
also.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
correct,
he
does
not.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
yes,
in
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county,
90%
of
the
people
put
up
the
10%
bond.
about
10%
put
up
the
100%
and--
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
might
be
money
or
real
estate
or
bonds
or
bonds
or
securities.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
an
encumbered
real
estate.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
i
am
sure
although
we
have
got
quite
a
few
more
(inaudible).
the
reason
that
90%
of
the
people
put
up
the
10%
bond
rather
than
the
100%
bond
is
based
on
i
think
on
the
return
that
they
can
get.
there
are
a
lot
of
rich
people
who
would
much
rather
put
up
10%
and
have
the
other
90%
working
for
them
because
the
state
loans
money
at
such
a
fantastically
low
interest
rate.
so,
i
do
not
think
that
really
rich
man
poor
man
makes
much
difference
here
because
anybody
given
a
choice,
if
they
think
it
out,
will
put
up
the
1%.
for
those
poor
people,
the
state
is
loaning
the
money
at
such
a
fantastically
low
interest
rate
that
i
just
do
not
think
rich
man
poor
man
applies.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
the
recognizance
people,
as
i
tried
to
make
clear,
state
considers
them
substantially
different
than
the
people
who
required
the
money.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
but
there
are
also
different
type
of
individual
that
the
judge
would
not
have
let
them
out.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
no,
but
the
judge
has
to
make
that
type
of
determination.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
correct,
their
expenses
are
the
same
as
putting
up
cash
bond.
i
am
sorry
i
did
not
understand
the
question
which
you
asked.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
they
are
substantially
different
and
the
judges
made
a
decision
that
they
are
most
likely
to
return
to
the
court
and
therefore
they
need
not
to
be
burdened
with
this
type
of
expense
as
opposed
to
the
others.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
i
think
that
since
we
are
granting
to
this
people,
a
new
substantial
benefit—
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
the
way
i
justified
is
over
past
this
stream,
the
illinois
has
never
charged
people
out
on
the
recognizance
bond
—
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
well,
i
do
not
think
we
can
charge
them
because
they
are
exercising
their
constitutional
right
also.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
correct.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
that
is
an
official
designation.
there
are
three
types
of
bonds
i
know
are
really
high
bonds
of
which
are
personal
recognizance,
d-bonds
which
are
the
10%
bonds
and
c-bonds
which
are
bonds
when
a
man
has
posted
the
full
amount.
in
cook
county
when
we
found
that
where
the
petty
offenses,
where
the
amount
of
bail
is
$25
or
less,
nobody
posts
a
10%
bond.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
on
parking
tickets
there
is
a
different
type.
but
on
most
cases,
it
is
$25
to
a
minimum
of
$5.
we
have
also
found
that
once
you
get
over
$25
that
the
amount,
the
percentage
is
90%,
it
will
post
the
10%
and
10%
it
will
post
the
100%.
now,
other
that,
about
10%
to
post
to
the
100%
bond.
there
are
illinois
supreme
court
rule
which
govern
certain
types
of
offenses
where
the
illinois
supreme
court
by
rule
and
it
is
specified
in
the
bond
statutes
that
supreme
court
made
specified
by
rule.
the
supreme
court
specifies
$500
cash,
which
means
that
10%
is
not
available
to
them,
and
that
is
anomaly
and
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
put
that
in
mostly
on
traffic
offenses
and
i
believe
it
is
to
prevent
practices
of
setting
too
high
a
bond
by
speed
track
judges,
i
believe
that,
that
is
the
policy
and
i
do
not
really
understand
—
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
no,
there
was
an
argument
made
in
the
illinois
supreme
court
on
the
petition
for
re-hearing
that
perhaps
one
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
rules
would
govern
at
100%
should
have
been
posted
rather
than
the
10%.
that
petition
for
hearing
was
denied
by
the
county.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
i
believed
it
to
be
your
honor.
the
supreme
has
passed
and
said
the
10%
would
properly
apply
here.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
just
wish
to
make
a
few
observations.
initially,
the
issue
here
is
the
constitutionality
of
that
cost
retention
provision.
this
system
will
go
on
regardless
of
whether
this
discriminatory
imposition
of
a
burden
on
one
segment
is
gone
away
with
their
net
or
if
i
can
answer,
i
believe
it
was
mr.
justice
marshall,
where
did
the
1%
figure
come
from?
it
came
from
the
fact
that
they
got
1%
on
forfeitures
from
bondsmen.
today,
they
equate
very
close
to
that
1%
on
forfeitures
and
bail
jumping
where
people
deposit
10%
and
they
deposit
the
full
amount.
they
are
getting
the
same
amount
of
money
that
they
got
before,
the
only
thing
they
are
doing
today
is
they
are
charging
one
segment
across
where
they
never
charged
them
--
across
anybody
across
before.
that
is
basically
what
it
is.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
well,
basically.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
that
man
did
not
lose
at
all,
i
agree
with
you
that
they
had
improved
the
system,
there
is
no
doubt
about
it,
but
the
difference
between
the
clerk
and
the
bondsman
is,
the
clerk
is
not
having
an
undertaking
to
pay
the
full
amount
if
the
guy
jumps
bail.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
or
it
all
go
onto
the
country
treasury,
but
the
county
is
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
no,
they
are
not,
definitely
not.
we
do
not
want
that.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
they
do
not
think
that
they
should
pay
anything
because
nobody
is
paying
for
it.
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
(inaudible)
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
what
other
states?
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
how
they
were
released?
mr.
john
j.
o’toole
does
the
district
of
columbis
not
leverage
10%
or
something
like
that?
