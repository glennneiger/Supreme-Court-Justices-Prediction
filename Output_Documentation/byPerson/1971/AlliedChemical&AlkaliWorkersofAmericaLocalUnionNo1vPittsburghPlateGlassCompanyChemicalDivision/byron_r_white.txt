mr.
come,
were
the
benefits
that
the
employer
had
been
paying
before
the
change
or
before
they
offer,
were
they
required
by
an
effective
bargaining
contract,
were
they
part
of
the
terms
of
the
collective
bargaining
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
the
union
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
anyway
it's
a
contractual
matter
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now
what
if
the
employer
had
just
instead
of
changing
the
payments,
he
just
cancels,
i
suppose
the
individual
retired
employees
would
have
had
a
cause
of
action
against
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
the
union
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
some
doubt
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
is
it
your
position
also
that
the
proposition
that
the
union
could
negotiate
a
modification
of
the
side
agreement
on
the
retirement
benefits,
reducing
them
and
bind
the
retired
employees?
here
is
an
agreement
that
has
been
made
that
promises
to
pay
x
and
there
are
employees
who
retire,
the
union
and
the
employer
get
together
and
they
all
agree
that
there
is
(inaudible)
or
something
or
that
there
is
this
desirable
of
low
retirement
benefits
generally
and
they
lower
them.
is
the
union
the
representative
of
those
retired
employees
for
that
purpose?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
does
that
workout
when
the
employee,
when
that
retired
employee
has
absolutely
no
voice?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
but
if
there
are
always
contractual
remedies
against
them.
if
he
lowers
the
--
if
he
does
not
live
up
to
his
agreement,
the
retired
employees
can
have
an
action
against
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
objection
is
that
he
is
raising
the
benefit?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
union
claim
or
does
the
board
claim
that
the
employer
would
process
or
just
reach
the
collective
or
side
agreement,
aside
of
what
he
has
done
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
would
been
a
remedy
for
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
the
plan
a
funded
by
the
insurance?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
had
a
contractual
right
to
keep
the
employer
from
canceling,
from
terminating
unilaterally
some
contracts?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
any
kind
of
a
grievance
arbitration
provision
in
the
said
agreement?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there
were
disagreements
that
they
would
arbitrate
or
something?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
normally
an
8
(a)
(5)
type
or
8
(a)
(5)
type
violation
if
an
employer
refuses
to
follow
the
grievance
procedure
in
a
collective
bargaining
contract
normally,
isn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
farmer,
suppose
the
union
during
negotiation
can
make
a
demand
upon
the
company
for
a
provision
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
no
changes
should
be
made
after
retirement
and
the
retirement
benefits
except
in
collective
bargaining
with
the
union,
would
that
demand
be
a
mandatory
subject
to
bargaining?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
are
bargaining
now
for
the
active
employee?
justice
byron
r.
white
without
collective
bargaining
with
union
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
contend
that
the
employer
has
the
right
either
to
increase
or
decrease
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
benefits
to
a
retired
employees?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
they
have
(inaudible)
--
your
premise
is
the
union
in
this
side
agreement?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i
mean
the
parties
to
the
contract,
to
the
union
and
the
company?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh
let's
assume
that
the
company
comes
along
and
just
unilaterally
increases
its
contributions
for
retired
employees
to
five-dollars?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
the
union
says
that
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
taking
--
there
is
less
money
available
for
active
employees?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
am
not
talking
about
the
bargaining
part.
i
am
just
asking
you
whether
there
is
an
existing
remedy
that
the
union
already
has
with
respect
to
either
increases
or
decreases?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
union
--
but
if
the
union
is
right
that
it
has
a
substantial
interest
in
presenting
increases
of
which
to
retired
employees
which
would
take
money
away
from
actives,
then
it
is
a
breach
of
a
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
farmer
does
this
issue
really
go
that
far.
i
thought
it
was
limited
to
the
question
whether
they
are
being
an
existing
agreement,
the
union
has
any
right
to
insist
on
bargaining
changes
in
an
existing
agreement?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
the
collective
bargaining?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
come
if
the
employer
during
the
term
of
collective
bargaining
contract
unilaterally
lowers
wages
contrary
to
contract
without
bargaining,
that
certainly
is
a
breach
of
contract,
isn't
it,
an
unfair
labor
practice?
justice
byron
r.
white
8
(d)--?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
but
it
is
not
an
8
(a)
(5)?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
now
no
other
reason?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
is
the
remedy
to
restore
it,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
the
only
remedy
plus
do
not
do
it
again?
justice
byron

the

that
