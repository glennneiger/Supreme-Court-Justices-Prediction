i
suppose
also
it
is
common
now,
is
it
not
mr.
farmer
that
retirement
benefits
for
the
present
employees
are
a
mandatory
subject
matter?
justice

stewart
but
the
emphasis
in
that
sentence
should
be
on
the
phrase
trade
mid-term?
justice
potter
stewart
as
you
rightly
say
i
think
in
answer
to
the
basic
question
when
the
board
said
that
this
is
a
violation
of
8
(a)
(5),
it
necessarily
said
that
this
is
a
subject
of
a
mandatory
collective
bargaining.
justice

stewart
(voice

have
been
any
unilateral
change?
justice
potter
stewart
the
legal
principle
here
does
not
boils
down
that.
he
can't
make
any
change
unilaterally
in
a
collective
agreement
that
he
has
made
without
being
sued
for
breach
of
the
contract,
for
breach
of
that
agreement.
it
does
not
involve
his
right
to
make
unilateral
changes
in
an
existing
employee
retired
existing
system
of
benefits
retirees?
he
obviously
does
not
have
that
right
without
violating
a
contract.
justice
potter
stewart
now
i
do
not
like
(inaudible)
your
submission
of
the
question,
but
i
do
not
think
it
is
a
matter
of
policy
decision
about
whether
or
not
it's
healthy
or
not
and
i
do
not
think
you
really
think
so
either,
it's
a
matter
that
law
provides.
