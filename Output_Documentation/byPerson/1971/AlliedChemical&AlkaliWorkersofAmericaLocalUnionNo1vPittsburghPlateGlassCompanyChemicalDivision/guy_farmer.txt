mr.
guy
farmer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
court.
we
say
the
case
of
course
quite
differently
from
brother
mr.
come
and
the
union
counsel,
mr.
riemer.
we
see
the
case
as
being
like
issue
not
of
subject
matter
of
bargaining,
but
a
fundamental
issue
as
to
the
representation
rights
of
the
union
and
a
parallel
bargaining
obligation
of
the
employer.
now
we
see
these
two
things
as
parallel
of
as
the
union's
exclusive
representation
rights
under
the
statue
are
the
same
or
cover
the
same
group
or
the
union
as
the
act
speaks
off,
as
a
group
which
the
employer
must
bargain
for.
now
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
the
question
of
whether
it
would
be
permissible
on
a
voluntary
basis
for
this
union
and
this
company
to
make
some
arrangements
to
improve
benefits
for
people
who
are
already
retired.
there
is
no
issue
with
that.
it
is
agreed.
the
court
below
held
that
on
a
voluntary
basis
this
could
be
done
under
the
act.
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
question
of
whether
it
is
mandatory,
obligatory
on
the
part
of
the
union
and
on
the
part
of
the
employer
to
bargain
for
these
people
who
have
already
retired.
mr.
guy
farmer
no
question
in
that.
it's
been
decided
for
many,
many
years
under
inland
steel
and
subsequent
cases
that
the
benefits
with
which
the
employees
retire
are
a
mandatory
subject
to
bargaining,
but
this
court
held
in
the
borg-warner
case
several
years
ago
after
a
different
gradations
of
bargaining
that
it's
permissive
and
that
it's
mandatory
and
that
it's
unlawful.
i
think
you
cannot
bargain
about
it
at
all.
i
think
you
must
bargain
about
and
there
are
things
you
may
bargain
about.
we
say
that
the
--
mr.
guy
farmer
190.
mr.
guy
farmer
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
guy
farmer
not
in
my
opinion,
your
honor.
in
my
opinion,
once
the
employer
employee
relationship
is
terminated
and
they
will
no
longer
working
or
performing
services,
that
they
no
longer
have
a
right
to
band
together
to
say
force
concessions
through
circulative
action
out
of
their
former
employer.
it
is
my
position
and
it
was
the
position
of
the
court
below
that
the
proper
time
for
employees
to
negotiate
their
retirement
benefits
is
when
they
are
working
and
performing
the
services
for
which
they
are
being
compensated
and
which
they
are
negotiating
about.
mr.
guy
farmer
i
do
not
believe
so.
mr.
guy
farmer
because
they
have
these
--
mr.
guy
farmer
they
could
bargain
for
the
active
employee
that
there
would
be
no
change
made
in
their
benefits
after
retirement
--
mr.
guy
farmer
now
that
without
collective
bargain
with
the
union
i
think
then
an
attempt
to
project
the
bargaining
obligation
into
the
retirement
situation,
i
think
they
could
even
bargain
that
if
the
cost
of
living
went
up,
the
benefits
would
automatically
escalate.
mr.
guy
farmer
yes
and
that
again
is
perfectly
valid
bargaining,
but
the
point
is
that
once
a
bargain
is
made
while
the
employees
working
as
to
what
his
benefits
would
be,
now
this
is
the
part
of
this
total
compensation.
this
was
based
on
a
combined
agreement
and
judgment
by
the
union
and
the
employer
as
to
value
of
the
services
which
he
is
rendering
and
this
comes
out
in
wages
and
benefits,
some
of
which
are
to
be
the
deferred
until
he
retires
and
when
he
retires
he
has
the
right
to
bargain
the
best
those
benefits
so
they
cannot
be
taken
away
or
reduced
by
the
company
or
anyone
else
and
all
this
is
valid.
but
once
this
employee
retires,
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
contrary
to
purpose
to
the
act
and
it
is
unfair
to
the
employer
to
say
that
he
must
continue
to
renegotiate
after
retirement
the
value
of
this
person's
services.
now,
he
cannot
as
the
court
below
pointed
out,
go
back
and
adjust
his
basis
to
compensate
for
what
he
is
going
to
bill
on
the
benefits
of
these
people
who
have
already
retired
and
so
he
is
going
to
be
subjected
under
the
board's
view
here
to
continued
repetition,
repetitive
re-evaluation
of
services
that
have
long
since
been
rendered
for
people
who
are
no
longer
rendering
any
services
at
all.
now
we
say
that
this
is
contrary
to
the
whole
principle
of
collective
bargaining
as
that
in
the
statute.
it
arises
from
the
statute
and
it
should
be
controlled
by
the
statute.
we
say
the
issue
here
is
who
this
union
represents,
and
who
does
the
employer
have
to
bargain
for
and
we
say
as
the
court
below
did
that
this
is
determined
by
the
statutory
provision
except
the
bargaining
process.
one
of
these
is
section
8
(a)
(5)
which
says
that
the
employer
must
bargain
with
the
representative
of
--
i
mean,
his
employees
are
subject
to
the
provisions
of
section
9,
that
is
what
8
(a)
(5)
--
mr.
guy
farmer
yes.
mr.
guy
farmer
i
do
not
think
the
--
if
the
contract
--
mr.
guy
farmer
change
in
the
benefits
of
retired
--
people
already
retired?
mr.
guy
farmer
i
do
not
quite
see
--
on
that.
mr.
guy
farmer
yes.
mr.
guy
farmer
it
depends
on
whether
that
change
is
to
be
applied
to
you
or
to
someone
who
has
already
retired.
that
would
depend
on
the
agreement
that
was
made.
now
there
are
many
people
who
retired
from
companies
who
have
different
levels
of
retirement
benefits
--
mr.
guy
farmer
on
time
in
which
they
have
retired
and
if
i
as
the
company
and
the
union
agree
to
go
back
to
the
1960
retirees
and
give
them
an
extra
three
dollars
a
month
that
would
not
automatically
apply
to
you
as
an
active
employee
unless
the
agreement
so
provides.
mr.
guy
farmer
i
am
sorry
i
did
not
quite
get
the
valid
point.
mr.
guy
farmer
no
that
is
not
true
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
guy
farmer
it
can
sue
for
breach
of
the
agreement
under
section
301.
mr.
guy
farmer
yes.
mr.
guy
farmer
yes.
mr.
guy
farmer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
guy
farmer
nothing
else
except
possible
arbitration
that
is
provided
for
which
could
be
provided
and
is
provided
in
some
cases.
now
if
it
pleases
the
court,
we
think
that
this
is
a
new
issue
before
the
court,
but
that
it
is
levered
by
very
clearly
established
principles.
now
up
to
this
time
and
i
would
challenge
the
board
to
produce
a
case
in
which
the
board
has
ever
held
that
a
union
can
force
bargaining
for
any
person
who
is
not
a
member
of
the
bargaining
unit
under
section
9.
mr.
guy
farmer
oh
i
do
not
--
mr.
guy
farmer
--
oh
i
do
not
--
i
think
he
has
the
right
to
increase
and
if
they
accept
the
--
if
they
want
to
accept
the
benefits
--
mr.
guy
farmer
you
are
talking
about
this
particular
--
mr.
guy
farmer
normally
agree
to
pay
four
dollars
a
month
as
a
contribution
towards
this
medical
insurance.
mr.
guy
farmer
and
with
the
right
to
reduce
it
to
two
dollars.
mr.
guy
farmer
the
company
did
not
--
the
company
started
to
or
acted
as
ever
talked
as
if
they
were
going
to
change
that
agreement,
but
they
did
not.
mr.
guy
farmer
well,
i
think
it
definitely
can
do
that.
mr.
guy
farmer
not
if
it
hurt
the
union.
mr.
guy
farmer
well,
that's
a
separate
interest.
bargaining
opens
up
a
pandora's
box,
that
i
can't
see
the
into
--
mr.
guy
farmer
well
if
the
increase
is
a
violation
of
that
agreement,
certainly
they
have
a
remedy.
the
question
in
my
own
mind
whether
that
would
be
a
violation
if
i
agree
to
pay
you
two-dollars
and
i
voluntarily
pay
you
four
out
of
--
mr.
guy
farmer
i
agree,
but
i
do
not
agree
that
the
company
had
--
that
the
union
has
much
of
an
interest
in
controlling
what
happens
to
people
that
is
doesn't
represent.
the
company
might
want
to
set
up
and
would
set
up
a
retirement
plan
for
supervisors
who
are
represented
by
the
union
and
the
union
might
say
well
that
money
you
should
not
do
that
because
that
money
is
money
you
could
spend
in
retirement
benefits
for
us,
but
certainly
they
have
no
right
to
require
the
company,
thus
negotiate
with
them
about
what
they
are
going
to
do
for
the
supervisors.
and
perhaps
i
have
not
got
your
point,
but
i
do
not
agree
with
the
interest
merely
that
the
union
can
represent
and
speak
for
exclusively
people
who
were
not,
whom
it
does
not
represents
or
not
in
the
bargaining
unit
because
the
company
might
in
someway
do
something
for
those
people
that
would
take
some
money
away
from
the
union
that
might
otherwise
go
to
union.
that
kind
of
an
argument
i
think
opens
up
a
completely
chaotic
situation
under
which
a
union
could
demand
bargaining
about
anything
and
anybody
at
anytime.
mr.
guy
farmer
no
questions.
mr.
guy
farmer
if
the
board
decision
is
right,
they
could
strike
the
force
more
benefits
for
retirees
and
even
if
they
had
no
benefits,
the
people
who
retire
without
benefits
of
any
kind
presumably
under
this
decisions
of
the
board
the
union
could
demand
that
at
the
program
of
benefits
be
instituted
for
people
who
have
retired
since
1950
or
whatever
date
and
the
company
would
have
to
negotiate
that
the
union
did
not
like
what
the
company
did
was
willing
to
do
they
strike
in
all
plants.
mr.
guy
farmer
i
do
not
believe
if
that
is
the
board's
position
and
i
would
say
that
if
that
were
the
position
that
the
it
would
be
pretty
close
to
being
correct.
in
other
words,
if
the
company
here
did
violate
that
agreement
then
it
was
under
board
decisions
that
unilateral
modifications
of
an
agreement
under
section
8
(b)
of
the
act,
and
therefore,
it
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice.
if
--
but
that
is
not
i
understand
the
board's
position.
the
board's
position
is
that
regardless
to
that
agreement
that
as
a
general
universal
rule,
persons
on
retirement
are
covered
by
the
mandatory
bargaining
obligation
and
the
union
that
happens
to
be
representing
the
active
employees
which
incidentally
may
never
have
represented
these
people,
though
you
can
have
a
change
in
representatives.
you
may
never
--
that
union
has
the
right
to
demand
mandatory
bargaining
for
a
people
who
have
left
the
employ
of
the
company
and
some
there
are
some
loose
arrangements
(inaudible)
time.
mr.
guy
farmer
yes,
your
honor
--
mr.
guy
farmer
yes
and
i
would
like
to
hear
the
answer
too
because
as
i
understand
it
if
claim
is
brought
on
that,
that
the
union
represents
these
people,
just
as
it
does
the
active
employees
and
they
can
initiate
negotiations
for
retirees
same
as
--
and
the
active
employees
don't
have
to
wait
until
the
company
does
something
or
initiate
something,
that
this
becomes
a
part
of
the
union’s
representation
rights
and
a
part
of
the
employer's
mandatory
bargaining
obligation.
this
is
the
way
they
presented
below
and
this
is
the
basis
on
which
the
court
below
decided
it
and
incidentally
we
could
add
i
think
very
little
to
the
analysis
of
the
court
below
simply
here
repeating
i
think
arguments
that
have
already
been
made
by
the
court
below.
we
think
it
covers
the
case
in
the
most
excellent
fashion
and
there
is
very
little
that
i
can
say.
now,
let
me
just
say
about
the
oliver
case.
well,
certainly
they
do
try
to
get
a
lot
of
millage
out
of
oliver.
they
are
saying
that
--
and
oliver
of
course
was
a
case
where
the
union
had
a
legitimate
interest
as
this
court
found
in
saying
that
it's
job
--
that
their
jobs
as
drivers
were
not
eroded
by
phony
arrangements
made
with
driver-owners,
and
therefore
the
union
and
the
company
made
an
agreement
that
the
amounts
paid
to
these
owner-drivers
would
not
be
below
a
certain
minimum,
that
was
just
to
project
the
erosion
of
the
jobs
in
that
bargaining
unit.
those
owner-drivers
presented
a
direct
threat
to
the
jobs
of
these
employee
drivers
and
this
court
so
hell
in
that
case.
now
to
say
that
to
these
retirees
who
have
no
bargaining
strings
whatsoever
who
are
not
competing
for
jobs,
they
are
not
competing
for
wages
that
they
present
such
as
threat
to
these
active
employees
who
have
the
power
to
shut
down
this
operation
anytime
to
get
their
demands
and
say
that
these
retirees
threat
them
so
much
that
the
actives
have
to
have
control
over
their
benefits,
i
think
becomes
almost
absurd
argument
and
i
do
not
think
that
oliver,
it
was
intended
to
go
that
far
at
all.
in
no
case
prior
to
this
has
a
board
ever
come
to
this
court
or
any
other
court,
had
made
the
argument
that
a
union
has
the
exclusive
right
to
represent
people
who
are
not
in
the
bargaining
unit
and
the
board
it
made
sure
that
retirees
are
not
in
the
bargaining
unit.
in
fact
the
board
has
uniformly
excluded
them
for
all
bargain
units
saying
they
do
not
have
a
community
interest
with
the
active
employees
and
probably
they
are
not
employees
at
all.
they
have
excluded
them.
they
have
excluded
them
here.
they
have
set
up
the
union
of
only
active
employees.
they
do
not
include
these
people.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
one
aspect
to
the
act,
that
is
the
investor
democracy
aspect
which
i
would
like
to
discuss
next.
thank
you.
mr.
guy
farmer
thank
you
and
may
it
please
the
court.
no
i
think
i
will
need
all
that
time
–
10
minutes
of
what
would
say.
i
think
that
court
as
i
said
the
court's
decision
below
in
my
opinion
is
sound
and
the
sets
forth
the
rationale
which
supports
the
decisions
of
the
court
below.
i
would
like
to
make
just
one
or
two
points
that
i
have
not
touched
on.
the
board
is
arguing
here
today
and
i
believe
for
the
first
time
that
bargaining
unit
does
not
control
the
scope
of
the
bargaining.
it
does
not
necessary
control
the
scope
of
the
bargaining.
this
i
think
it
is
basic
to
this
case
and
this
is
a
change
of
position
on
the
part
of
board,
the
position
it
took
in
the
court
below.
in
the
court
below
the
board
conceded
that
the
obligation
to
bargain
is
limited
to
bargaining
unit
and
that
position
is
supported
by
a
long
line,
unbroken
line
of
decisions
by
the
board
itself
and
by
the
courts
and
is
supported
by
the
statute.
i
did
not
cite
section
8
(b)
(3)
in
the
appendix
to
read.
i
didn't
cite
8
(a)
(5)
which
says
that
the
employer's
bargaining
obligation
is
to
bargain
with
the
representative
of
his
employees
subject
to
section
9
(a).
section
8
(b)
(3)
says
same
thing
with
respect
to
unions.
it
says
that
a
union
bargains
subject
to
section
9.
that
as
the
court
said,
the
second
circuit
said
in
the
one
of
the
two
ila
cases
where
the
ila
tried
to
force
a
company
or
the
shipping
companies
in
new
york
to
bargain
for
longshoremen
in
florida
and
other
places
which
were
not
in
the
same
bargaining
unit
a.
the
board
went
into
court
in
that
case
and
got
an
injunction
against
that
strike
and
later
held
that
it
was
a
violation
of
the
act
to
try
to
force
bargaining
outside
the
bargain
unit.
and
in
that
case,
i
believe
it
judge
friendly
who
said,
section
9
fixes
the
framework
within
which
labor
and
management
are
required
to
bargain
and
the
court
of
appeals
here
in
the
second
ila
case
under
similar
circumstances
held
the
same
thing.
it
said
that
the
extent
of
the
bargaining
obligation
is
determined
by
certification
of
the
bargaining
unit.
that
is
precisely
what
the
act
itself
says
in
section
9.
now,
the
board
would
have
to
concede
here
that
people
who
have
retired
permanently
and
no
longer
are
employed
or
employment
services
are
not
in
the
bargaining
unit.
the
board
does
not
pay
as
i
understand,
in
fact
these
people
are
in
the
bargaining
unit,
that
they
project
here
an
entirely
new
argument
that
a
union
can
under
certain
circumstances
not
clearly
defined
demand
bargaining
for
people
who
are
not
in
the
bargaining
unit.
mr.
guy
farmer
i
think
they
very
well
might.
i
know
one
union
at
least
that
would
and
has
consistently
honored
such
--
well
a
picket
line
by
retired
persons
have
been
honored
traditionally
in
the
coal
industry
and
i
can't
ask
elsewhere,
but
i
know
that
to
be
a
fact
as
far
coal
miners
are
concerned.
now,
it
seems
to
me
whether
congress
designed
the
act,
designed
it
around
the
theory
of
industrial
democracy
and
the
employees
in
groupings
that
the
board
would
determine
which
are
called
bargaining
units
that
they
would
select
by
a
majority
vote
their
representative
and
that
representative
would
then
represent
all
of
them
exclusively
in
that
unit.
but
by
like
token
that
representative
was
not
intended
to
have
any
authority
to
represent
anyone
who
was
not
in
that
unit
for
which
it
had
been
selected.
now
in
this
particular
case
the
board
has
certified
the
unit
back
in
1949
in
which
it
excluded
which
it
limited
the
unit
to
active
working
employees
and
not
include
those
pensioners
and
then
allowed
them
to
vote.
but
that
is
in
accordance
with
the
board's
uniform
policy
which
they
followed
in
every
case
in
which
this
issue
has
ever
come
up
and
they
are
saying
today
in
their
brief
that
they
still
would
not
allow
retired
people
to
vote
or
be
a
part
of
a
bargaining
unit.
they
say
that
they
do
not
have
a
community
of
interest
with
these
active
people
sufficient
to
allow
them
to
be
in
the
same
bargaining
unit.
and
yet
inconsistently
it
seems
to
me
they
are
still
arguing
that
the
bargaining
unit
representative
is
their
exclusive
representative
so
this
is
representation
without
any
voice
in
the
selection
of
the
union
or
provisions
in
the
act
whereby
a
union
can
be
changed.
they
have
no
voice
in
that.
they
have
no
voice
in
this
particular
union
in
ratifying
agreements
that
are
made.
now,
it
may
well
be
that
unions
would
not
as
a
matter
of
fact
just
want
to
try
to
injure
retirees.
i
am
not
saying
that
they
would
but
i
am
saying
uncertainty
the
possibility
exists.
we
kind
of
expect
that
it
could
not
happen
that
the
active
people
say
we
want
all
his
money
in
wages
now
and
we
do
not
want
you
giving
any
money
to
these
people
who
have
retired
and
they
would
have
the
right
to
strike
to
force
that
demand
and
an
employer,
a
weak
employer
might
very
well
give
into
it.
i
think
regardless
of
arguments
about
the
right
to
fair
representation
and
arguments
that
the
unions
are
altruistic
and
all
those
things
which
they
are,
nevertheless
the
opportunity
would
still
exist
and
we
could
not
say
and
i
do
not
believe
anyone
could
say
that
it
would
not
happen
that
a
union
might
under
certain
circumstances
act
to
the
determent
of
these
people
who
have
no
economic
strength
of
their
own
because
they
scattered
all
over,
those
190
people
in
several
different
states
and
some
are
even
in
yugoslavia
today
where
they
are
obviously
would
not
have
any
economic
strength
in
this
picture
as
the
court
below
pointed
out.
mr.
guy
farmer
well
i
think
if
they
ever
have
one
that
it
ought
to
be
one
they
select
themselves
and
of
course
the
board
hasn't
answered
that
question,
if
they
are
a
part
of
some
bargaining
set
up.
do
they
--
must
they
only
be
represented
by
this
union
that
represents
the
actives?
should
they
not
be
permitted
to
have
their
own
union
to
represent
their
own
interest
as
the
board
says
they
are
not
in
common
with
the
interest
of
the
active
employees.
these
are
questions
that
we
have
raised
concerning
the
scope
of
this
ruling
and
we
have
had
no
answer
to
those
questions
and
i
cannot
say,
but
it
would
say
to
me
logically
that
they
should
not
be
entitled,
if
they
are
going
to
be
represented,
they
should
be
entitled
to
select
their
representative.
i
like
to
move
now
to
the
pint
made
by
my
brother
come
that
there
is
a,
and
by
union
counsel
that
everybody
is
doing
this.
now
that
is
not
true
because
we
have
in
this
case
amicus
briefs
filed
by
employer
groups
who
say
they
are
not
doing
it
and
they
know
others
who
are
not
doing
it
too.
i
mean,
bargaining
for
benefits
for
people
after
they
retire,
but
they
are
saying,
the
argument
is
that
because
it's
asserted
that
a
lot
of
people
are
permissively
or
voluntarily
making
arrangements
for
retirees
that
the
court
should
then
say
well
this
now
becomes
a
mandatory
obligation
for
everyone
and
the
logic
of
that
argument
i
must
say
escapes
me
and
would
certainly
inhibit
employers
and
unions
from
experimenting
with
new
subjects
of
bargaining
in
new
areas
if
then
turned
out
to
be
a
practice
that
was
turned
to
practice
and
becomes
the
law.
now,
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
in
this
case
which
the
board
sat
on
for
two
years
before
deciding
what
to
do
with
it,
there
is
not
one
iota
of
evidence
as
to
what
industry
practice
is
in
the
record
this
case
and
all
this
is
derived
from
self
serving
statements
made
by,
amicus
briefs
on
both
sides.
mr.
guy
farmer
yes
i
say
it
is
not
because
they
are
not
employees.
they
are
not
in
any
and
in
order
to
be
whether
it's
be
a
bargaining
obligation,
it
runs
between
the
employer
and
his
employees
and
once
they
have
retired
permanently
with
no
expectations
of
re-employment,
requiring
no
services,
receiving
no
salary
which
simply
enjoying
the
fruits
of
what
they
negotiated
while
they
were
working
that
the
bargaining
obligation
no
longer
exists.
of
course
that
is
our
position
and
that
is
what
the
court
below
held
that
there
is
no
place
in
this
structure
for
organizations
of
retirees
who
can
force
mandatory
bargaining
on
the
employer,
who
could
come
and
picket
his
plant
and
shut
it
down
even
though
the
employees
working
there
might
have
perfectly
satisfactory
arrangement
as
far
as
their
concerned,
but
the
retiree
wants
more,
he
wants
more
for
himself
so
he
bands
together
and
forms
a
union
to
come
in
and
negotiate,
but
he
does
not
have
any
understanding
under
the
act
because
under
the
act
as
it
is
structured
as
the
court
below
held
that
the
bargain
relationship
exists
in
between
the
employer
and
his
current
employees.
mr.
guy
farmer
i
would
say
it
would
be
limited
to
a
suit
for
violation
of
the
agreement
which
could
be
a
class
action
or
what
we
have
here
under
section
301.
now
they
can
when
they
are
in
active
status
they
can
negotiate
these
benefits,
they
can
provide
for
their
investing
as
here
the
pensions
are
invested
in
this
company
after
15
years.
nobody
can
take
those
away
from
the
ones
they
have
invested
and
they
have
served
the
15
years
and
then
retired
and
if
they
were
taken
away
or
reduced
they
would
have
their
remedy
in
court
to
protect
their
beneficial
interests
and
there
are
many
cases
which
so
hold,
but
to
say
that
they
can
come
to
the
employer
they
have
let's
say
retired
with
$250
a
month
pension
based
on
the
pension
plan
in
effect
they
come
to
him
five
years
later
and
say
we
think
this
ought
to
be
five
hundred
and
we
banded
together
and
now
we
are
going
to
picket
you
until
you
agree
to
pay.
i
think
this
is
outside
the
contemplation
of
the
statute
which
is
supposed
to
resolve
of
all
ongoing
issues
between,
in
our
industrial
society,
between
employers
and
their
current
work
force
of
employees.
and
i
think
that
every
word
in
the
act
and
every
decision
up
to
now
has
been
consistent
with
that
interpretation
of
it
and
inconsistent
with
the
view
that
a
union
representing
active
employees
can
not
only
negotiate
their
benefits
to
take
effect
when
they
retire,
but
can
reach
out
and
renegotiate
without
limitation,
not
just
once
but
any
number
of
times
the
benefits
that
the
employee
retired
with.
as
i
said
earlier
i
do
not
think
--
i
think
that
this
creates
a
an
unfair
burden
on
employers
to
expose
him
to
this
risk
indefinitely
when
he
cannot
got
back
and
say
alright
i
will
have
to
adjust
my
price
levels
in
order
to
pay
those
things
retroactively.
now
the
industrial
practice
is
very
spotty
as
i
read
the
various
amicus
briefs.
there
are
some
companies
do
negotiate
these
things
with
their
unions,
some
do
not,
some
discuss
them
with
them
and
work
them
out
on
an
amicable
basis
but
to
say
that
the
act
will
be
in
effect
amended
by
some
kind
of
industrial
practice
i
think
is
contrary
to
normal
rules
of
the
statutory
interpretations.
thank
you.
mr.
guy
farmer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
court.
we
say
the
case
of
course
quite
differently
from
brother
mr.
come
and
the
union
counsel,
mr.
riemer.
we
see
the
case
as
being
like
issue
not
of
subject
matter
of
bargaining,
but
a
fundamental
issue
as
to
the
representation
rights
of
the
union
and
a
parallel
bargaining
obligation
of
the
employer.
now
we
see
these
two
things
as
parallel
of
as
the
union's
exclusive
representation
rights
under
the
statue
are
the
same
or
cover
the
same
group
or
the
union
as
the
act
speaks
off,
as
a
group
which
the
employer
must
bargain
for.
now
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
the
question
of
whether
it
would
be
permissible
on
a
voluntary
basis
for
this
union
and
this
company
to
make
some
arrangements
to
improve
benefits
for
people
who
are
already
retired.
there
is
no
issue
with
that.
it
is
agreed.
the
court
below
held
that
on
a
voluntary
basis
this
could
be
done
under
the
act.
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
question
of
whether
it
is
mandatory,
obligatory
on
the
part
of
the
union
and
on
the
part
of
the
employer
to
bargain
for
these
people
who
have
already
retired.
mr.
guy
farmer
no
question
in
that.
it's
been
decided
for
many,
many
years
under
inland
steel
and
subsequent
cases
that
the
benefits
with
which
the
employees
retire
are
a
mandatory
subject
to
bargaining,
but
this
court
held
in
the
borg-warner
case
several
years
ago
after
a
different
gradations
of
bargaining
that
it's
permissive
and
that
it's
mandatory
and
that
it's
unlawful.
i
think
you
cannot
bargain
about
it
at
all.
i
think
you
must
bargain
about
and
there
are
things
you
may
bargain
about.
we
say
that
the
--
mr.
guy
farmer
190.
mr.
guy
farmer
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
guy
farmer
not
in
my
opinion,
your
honor.
in
my
opinion,
once
the
employer
employee
relationship
is
terminated
and
they
will
no
longer
working
or
performing
services,
that
they
no
longer
have
a
right
to
band
together
to
say
force
concessions
through
circulative
action
out
of
their
former
employer.
it
is
my
position
and
it
was
the
position
of
the
court
below
that
the
proper
time
for
employees
to
negotiate
their
retirement
benefits
is
when
they
are
working
and
performing
the
services
for
which
they
are
being
compensated
and
which
they
are
negotiating
about.
mr.
guy
farmer
i
do
not
believe
so.
mr.
guy
farmer
because
they
have
these
--
mr.
guy
farmer
they
could
bargain
for
the
active
employee
that
there
would
be
no
change
made
in
their
benefits
after
retirement
--
mr.
guy
farmer
now
that
without
collective
bargain
with
the
union
i
think
then
an
attempt
to
project
the
bargaining
obligation
into
the
retirement
situation,
i
think
they
could
even
bargain
that
if
the
cost
of
living
went
up,
the
benefits
would
automatically
escalate.
mr.
guy
farmer
yes
and
that
again
is
perfectly
valid
bargaining,
but
the
point
is
that
once
a
bargain
is
made
while
the
employees
working
as
to
what
his
benefits
would
be,
now
this
is
the
part
of
this
total
compensation.
this
was
based
on
a
combined
agreement
and
judgment
by
the
union
and
the
employer
as
to
value
of
the
services
which
he
is
rendering
and
this
comes
out
in
wages
and
benefits,
some
of
which
are
to
be
the
deferred
until
he
retires
and
when
he
retires
he
has
the
right
to
bargain
the
best
those
benefits
so
they
cannot
be
taken
away
or
reduced
by
the
company
or
anyone
else
and
all
this
is
valid.
but
once
this
employee
retires,
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
contrary
to
purpose
to
the
act
and
it
is
unfair
to
the
employer
to
say
that
he
must
continue
to
renegotiate
after
retirement
the
value
of
this
person's
services.
now,
he
cannot
as
the
court
below
pointed
out,
go
back
and
adjust
his
basis
to
compensate
for
what
he
is
going
to
bill
on
the
benefits
of
these
people
who
have
already
retired
and
so
he
is
going
to
be
subjected
under
the
board's
view
here
to
continued
repetition,
repetitive
re-evaluation
of
services
that
have
long
since
been
rendered
for
people
who
are
no
longer
rendering
any
services
at
all.
now
we
say
that
this
is
contrary
to
the
whole
principle
of
collective
bargaining
as
that
in
the
statute.
it
arises
from
the
statute
and
it
should
be
controlled
by
the
statute.
we
say
the
issue
here
is
who
this
union
represents,
and
who
does
the
employer
have
to
bargain
for
and
we
say
as
the
court
below
did
that
this
is
determined
by
the
statutory
provision
except
the
bargaining
process.
one
of
these
is
section
8
(a)
(5)
which
says
that
the
employer
must
bargain
with
the
representative
of
--
i
mean,
his
employees
are
subject
to
the
provisions
of
section
9,
that
is
what
8
(a)
(5)
--
mr.
guy
farmer
yes.
mr.
guy
farmer
i
do
not
think
the
--
if
the
contract
--
mr.
guy
farmer
change
in
the
benefits
of
retired
--
people
already
retired?
mr.
guy
farmer
i
do
not
quite
see
--
on
that.
mr.
guy
farmer
yes.
mr.
guy
farmer
it
depends
on
whether
that
change
is
to
be
applied
to
you
or
to
someone
who
has
already
retired.
that
would
depend
on
the
agreement
that
was
made.
now
there
are
many
people
who
retired
from
companies
who
have
different
levels
of
retirement
benefits
--
mr.
guy
farmer
on
time
in
which
they
have
retired
and
if
i
as
the
company
and
the
union
agree
to
go
back
to
the
1960
retirees
and
give
them
an
extra
three
dollars
a
month
that
would
not
automatically
apply
to
you
as
an
active
employee
unless
the
agreement
so
provides.
mr.
guy
farmer
i
am
sorry
i
did
not
quite
get
the
valid
point.
mr.
guy
farmer
no
that
is
not
true
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
guy
farmer
it
can
sue
for
breach
of
the
agreement
under
section
301.
mr.
guy
farmer
yes.
mr.
guy
farmer
yes.
mr.
guy
farmer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
guy
farmer
nothing
else
except
possible
arbitration
that
is
provided
for
which
could
be
provided
and
is
provided
in
some
cases.
now
if
it
pleases
the
court,
we
think
that
this
is
a
new
issue
before
the
court,
but
that
it
is
levered
by
very
clearly
established
principles.
now
up
to
this
time
and
i
would
challenge
the
board
to
produce
a
case
in
which
the
board
has
ever
held
that
a
union
can
force
bargaining
for
any
person
who
is
not
a
member
of
the
bargaining
unit
under
section
9.
mr.
guy
farmer
oh
i
do
not
--
mr.
guy
farmer
--
oh
i
do
not
--
i
think
he
has
the
right
to
increase
and
if
they
accept
the
--
if
they
want
to
accept
the
benefits
--
mr.
guy
farmer
you
are
talking
about
this
particular
--
mr.
guy
farmer
normally
agree
to
pay
four
dollars
a
month
as
a
contribution
towards
this
medical
insurance.
mr.
guy
farmer
and
with
the
right
to
reduce
it
to
two
dollars.
mr.
guy
farmer
the
company
did
not
--
the
company
started
to
or
acted
as
ever
talked
as
if
they
were
going
to
change
that
agreement,
but
they
did
not.
mr.
guy
farmer
well,
i
think
it
definitely
can
do
that.
mr.
guy
farmer
not
if
it
hurt
the
union.
mr.
guy
farmer
well,
that's
a
separate
interest.
bargaining
opens
up
a
pandora's
box,
that
i
can't
see
the
into
--
mr.
guy
farmer
well
if
the
increase
is
a
violation
of
that
agreement,
certainly
they
have
a
remedy.
the
question
in
my
own
mind
whether
that
would
be
a
violation
if
i
agree
to
pay
you
two-dollars
and
i
voluntarily
pay
you
four
out
of
--
mr.
guy
farmer
i
agree,
but
i
do
not
agree
that
the
company
had
--
that
the
union
has
much
of
an
interest
in
controlling
what
happens
to
people
that
is
doesn't
represent.
the
company
might
want
to
set
up
and
would
set
up
a
retirement
plan
for
supervisors
who
are
represented
by
the
union
and
the
union
might
say
well
that
money
you
should
not
do
that
because
that
money
is
money
you
could
spend
in
retirement
benefits
for
us,
but
certainly
they
have
no
right
to
require
the
company,
thus
negotiate
with
them
about
what
they
are
going
to
do
for
the
supervisors.
and
perhaps
i
have
not
got
your
point,
but
i
do
not
agree
with
the
interest
merely
that
the
union
can
represent
and
speak
for
exclusively
people
who
were
not,
whom
it
does
not
represents
or
not
in
the
bargaining
unit
because
the
company
might
in
someway
do
something
for
those
people
that
would
take
some
money
away
from
the
union
that
might
otherwise
go
to
union.
that
kind
of
an
argument
i
think
opens
up
a
completely
chaotic
situation
under
which
a
union
could
demand
bargaining
about
anything
and
anybody
at
anytime.
mr.
guy
farmer
no
questions.
mr.
guy
farmer
if
the
board
decision
is
right,
they
could
strike
the
force
more
benefits
for
retirees
and
even
if
they
had
no
benefits,
the
people
who
retire
without
benefits
of
any
kind
presumably
under
this
decisions
of
the
board
the
union
could
demand
that
at
the
program
of
benefits
be
instituted
for
people
who
have
retired
since
1950
or
whatever
date
and
the
company
would
have
to
negotiate
that
the
union
did
not
like
what
the
company
did
was
willing
to
do
they
strike
in
all
plants.
mr.
guy
farmer
i
do
not
believe
if
that
is
the
board's
position
and
i
would
say
that
if
that
were
the
position
that
the
it
would
be
pretty
close
to
being
correct.
in
other
words,
if
the
company
here
did
violate
that
agreement
then
it
was
under
board
decisions
that
unilateral
modifications
of
an
agreement
under
section
8
(b)
of
the
act,
and
therefore,
it
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice.
if
--
but
that
is
not
i
understand
the
board's
position.
the
board's
position
is
that
regardless
to
that
agreement
that
as
a
general
universal
rule,
persons
on
retirement
are
covered
by
the
mandatory
bargaining
obligation
and
the
union
that
happens
to
be
representing
the
active
employees
which
incidentally
may
never
have
represented
these
people,
though
you
can
have
a
change
in
representatives.
you
may
never
--
that
union
has
the
right
to
demand
mandatory
bargaining
for
a
people
who
have
left
the
employ
of
the
company
and
some
there
are
some
loose
arrangements
(inaudible)
time.
mr.
guy
farmer
yes,
your
honor
--
mr.
guy
farmer
yes
and
i
would
like
to
hear
the
answer
too
because
as
i
understand
it
if
claim
is
brought
on
that,
that
the
union
represents
these
people,
just
as
it
does
the
active
employees
and
they
can
initiate
negotiations
for
retirees
same
as
--
and
the
active
employees
don't
have
to
wait
until
the
company
does
something
or
initiate
something,
that
this
becomes
a
part
of
the
union’s
representation
rights
and
a
part
of
the
employer's
mandatory
bargaining
obligation.
this
is
the
way
they
presented
below
and
this
is
the
basis
on
which
the
court
below
decided
it
and
incidentally
we
could
add
i
think
very
little
to
the
analysis
of
the
court
below
simply
here
repeating
i
think
arguments
that
have
already
been
made
by
the
court
below.
we
think
it
covers
the
case
in
the
most
excellent
fashion
and
there
is
very
little
that
i
can
say.
now,
let
me
just
say
about
the
oliver
case.
well,
certainly
they
do
try
to
get
a
lot
of
millage
out
of
oliver.
they
are
saying
that
--
and
oliver
of
course
was
a
case
where
the
union
had
a
legitimate
interest
as
this
court
found
in
saying
that
it's
job
--
that
their
jobs
as
drivers
were
not
eroded
by
phony
arrangements
made
with
driver-owners,
and
therefore
the
union
and
the
company
made
an
agreement
that
the
amounts
paid
to
these
owner-drivers
would
not
be
below
a
certain
minimum,
that
was
just
to
project
the
erosion
of
the
jobs
in
that
bargaining
unit.
those
owner-drivers
presented
a
direct
threat
to
the
jobs
of
these
employee
drivers
and
this
court
so
hell
in
that
case.
now
to
say
that
to
these
retirees
who
have
no
bargaining
strings
whatsoever
who
are
not
competing
for
jobs,
they
are
not
competing
for
wages
that
they
present
such
as
threat
to
these
active
employees
who
have
the
power
to
shut
down
this
operation
anytime
to
get
their
demands
and
say
that
these
retirees
threat
them
so
much
that
the
actives
have
to
have
control
over
their
benefits,
i
think
becomes
almost
absurd
argument
and
i
do
not
think
that
oliver,
it
was
intended
to
go
that
far
at
all.
in
no
case
prior
to
this
has
a
board
ever
come
to
this
court
or
any
other
court,
had
made
the
argument
that
a
union
has
the
exclusive
right
to
represent
people
who
are
not
in
the
bargaining
unit
and
the
board
it
made
sure
that
retirees
are
not
in
the
bargaining
unit.
in
fact
the
board
has
uniformly
excluded
them
for
all
bargain
units
saying
they
do
not
have
a
community
interest
with
the
active
employees
and
probably
they
are
not
employees
at
all.
they
have
excluded
them.
they
have
excluded
them
here.
they
have
set
up
the
union
of
only
active
employees.
they
do
not
include
these
people.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
one
aspect
to
the
act,
that
is
the
investor
democracy
aspect
which
i
would
like
to
discuss
next.
thank
you.
mr.
guy
farmer
thank
you
and
may
it
please
the
court.
no
i
think
i
will
need
all
that
time
–
10
minutes
of
what
would
say.
i
think
that
court
as
i
said
the
court's
decision
below
in
my
opinion
is
sound
and
the
sets
forth
the
rationale
which
supports
the
decisions
of
the
court
below.
i
would
like
to
make
just
one
or
two
points
that
i
have
not
touched
on.
the
board
is
arguing
here
today
and
i
believe
for
the
first
time
that
bargaining
unit
does
not
control
the
scope
of
the
bargaining.
it
does
not
necessary
control
the
scope
of
the
bargaining.
this
i
think
it
is
basic
to
this
case
and
this
is
a
change
of
position
on
the
part
of
board,
the
position
it
took
in
the
court
below.
in
the
court
below
the
board
conceded
that
the
obligation
to
bargain
is
limited
to
bargaining
unit
and
that
position
is
supported
by
a
long
line,
unbroken
line
of
decisions
by
the
board
itself
and
by
the
courts
and
is
supported
by
the
statute.
i
did
not
cite
section
8
(b)
(3)
in
the
appendix
to
read.
i
didn't
cite
8
(a)
(5)
which
says
that
the
employer's
bargaining
obligation
is
to
bargain
with
the
representative
of
his
employees
subject
to
section
9
(a).
section
8
(b)
(3)
says
same
thing
with
respect
to
unions.
it
says
that
a
union
bargains
subject
to
section
9.
that
as
the
court
said,
the
second
circuit
said
in
the
one
of
the
two
ila
cases
where
the
ila
tried
to
force
a
company
or
the
shipping
companies
in
new
york
to
bargain
for
longshoremen
in
florida
and
other
places
which
were
not
in
the
same
bargaining
unit
a.
the
board
went
into
court
in
that
case
and
got
an
injunction
against
that
strike
and
later
held
that
it
was
a
violation
of
the
act
to
try
to
force
bargaining
outside
the
bargain
unit.
and
in
that
case,
i
believe
it
judge
friendly
who
said,
section
9
fixes
the
framework
within
which
labor
and
management
are
required
to
bargain
and
the
court
of
appeals
here
in
the
second
ila
case
under
similar
circumstances
held
the
same
thing.
it
said
that
the
extent
of
the
bargaining
obligation
is
determined
by
certification
of
the
bargaining
unit.
that
is
precisely
what
the
act
itself
says
in
section
9.
now,
the
board
would
have
to
concede
here
that
people
who
have
retired
permanently
and
no
longer
are
employed
or
employment
services
are
not
in
the
bargaining
unit.
the
board
does
not
pay
as
i
understand,
in
fact
these
people
are
in
the
bargaining
unit,
that
they
project
here
an
entirely
new
argument
that
a
union
can
under
certain
circumstances
not
clearly
defined
demand
bargaining
for
people
who
are
not
in
the
bargaining
unit.
mr.
guy
farmer
i
think
they
very
well
might.
i
know
one
union
at
least
that
would
and
has
consistently
honored
such
--
well
a
picket
line
by
retired
persons
have
been
honored
traditionally
in
the
coal
industry
and
i
can't
ask
elsewhere,
but
i
know
that
to
be
a
fact
as
far
coal
miners
are
concerned.
now,
it
seems
to
me
whether
congress
designed
the
act,
designed
it
around
the
theory
of
industrial
democracy
and
the
employees
in
groupings
that
the
board
would
determine
which
are
called
bargaining
units
that
they
would
select
by
a
majority
vote
their
representative
and
that
representative
would
then
represent
all
of
them
exclusively
in
that
unit.
but
by
like
token
that
representative
was
not
intended
to
have
any
authority
to
represent
anyone
who
was
not
in
that
unit
for
which
it
had
been
selected.
now
in
this
particular
case
the
board
has
certified
the
unit
back
in
1949
in
which
it
excluded
which
it
limited
the
unit
to
active
working
employees
and
not
include
those
pensioners
and
then
allowed
them
to
vote.
but
that
is
in
accordance
with
the
board's
uniform
policy
which
they
followed
in
every
case
in
which
this
issue
has
ever
come
up
and
they
are
saying
today
in
their
brief
that
they
still
would
not
allow
retired
people
to
vote
or
be
a
part
of
a
bargaining
unit.
they
say
that
they
do
not
have
a
community
of
interest
with
these
active
people
sufficient
to
allow
them
to
be
in
the
same
bargaining
unit.
and
yet
inconsistently
it
seems
to
me
they
are
still
arguing
that
the
bargaining
unit
representative
is
their
exclusive
representative
so
this
is
representation
without
any
voice
in
the
selection
of
the
union
or
provisions
in
the
act
whereby
a
union
can
be
changed.
they
have
no
voice
in
that.
they
have
no
voice
in
this
particular
union
in
ratifying
agreements
that
are
made.
now,
it
may
well
be
that
unions
would
not
as
a
matter
of
fact
just
want
to
try
to
injure
retirees.
i
am
not
saying
that
they
would
but
i
am
saying
uncertainty
the
possibility
exists.
we
kind
of
expect
that
it
could
not
happen
that
the
active
people
say
we
want
all
his
money
in
wages
now
and
we
do
not
want
you
giving
any
money
to
these
people
who
have
retired
and
they
would
have
the
right
to
strike
to
force
that
demand
and
an
employer,
a
weak
employer
might
very
well
give
into
it.
i
think
regardless
of
arguments
about
the
right
to
fair
representation
and
arguments
that
the
unions
are
altruistic
and
all
those
things
which
they
are,
nevertheless
the
opportunity
would
still
exist
and
we
could
not
say
and
i
do
not
believe
anyone
could
say
that
it
would
not
happen
that
a
union
might
under
certain
circumstances
act
to
the
determent
of
these
people
who
have
no
economic
strength
of
their
own
because
they
scattered
all
over,
those
190
people
in
several
different
states
and
some
are
even
in
yugoslavia
today
where
they
are
obviously
would
not
have
any
economic
strength
in
this
picture
as
the
court
below
pointed
out.
mr.
guy
farmer
well
i
think
if
they
ever
have
one
that
it
ought
to
be
one
they
select
themselves
and
of
course
the
board
hasn't
answered
that
question,
if
they
are
a
part
of
some
bargaining
set
up.
do
they
--
must
they
only
be
represented
by
this
union
that
represents
the
actives?
should
they
not
be
permitted
to
have
their
own
union
to
represent
their
own
interest
as
the
board
says
they
are
not
in
common
with
the
interest
of
the
active
employees.
these
are
questions
that
we
have
raised
concerning
the
scope
of
this
ruling
and
we
have
had
no
answer
to
those
questions
and
i
cannot
say,
but
it
would
say
to
me
logically
that
they
should
not
be
entitled,
if
they
are
going
to
be
represented,
they
should
be
entitled
to
select
their
representative.
i
like
to
move
now
to
the
pint
made
by
my
brother
come
that
there
is
a,
and
by
union
counsel
that
everybody
is
doing
this.
now
that
is
not
true
because
we
have
in
this
case
amicus
briefs
filed
by
employer
groups
who
say
they
are
not
doing
it
and
they
know
others
who
are
not
doing
it
too.
i
mean,
bargaining
for
benefits
for
people
after
they
retire,
but
they
are
saying,
the
argument
is
that
because
it's
asserted
that
a
lot
of
people
are
permissively
or
voluntarily
making
arrangements
for
retirees
that
the
court
should
then
say
well
this
now
becomes
a
mandatory
obligation
for
everyone
and
the
logic
of
that
argument
i
must
say
escapes
me
and
would
certainly
inhibit
employers
and
unions
from
experimenting
with
new
subjects
of
bargaining
in
new
areas
if
then
turned
out
to
be
a
practice
that
was
turned
to
practice
and
becomes
the
law.
now,
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
in
this
case
which
the
board
sat
on
for
two
years
before
deciding
what
to
do
with
it,
there
is
not
one
iota
of
evidence
as
to
what
industry
practice
is
in
the
record
this
case
and
all
this
is
derived
from
self
serving
statements
made
by,
amicus
briefs
on
both
sides.
mr.
guy
farmer
yes
i
say
it
is
not
because
they
are
not
employees.
they
are
not
in
any
and
in
order
to
be
whether
it's
be
a
bargaining
obligation,
it
runs
between
the
employer
and
his
employees
and
once
they
have
retired
permanently
with
no
expectations
of
re-employment,
requiring
no
services,
receiving
no
salary
which
simply
enjoying
the
fruits
of
what
they
negotiated
while
they
were
working
that
the
bargaining
obligation
no
longer
exists.
of
course
that
is
our
position
and
that
is
what
the
court
below
held
that
there
is
no
place
in
this
structure
for
organizations
of
retirees
who
can
force
mandatory
bargaining
on
the
employer,
who
could
come
and
picket
his
plant
and
shut
it
down
even
though
the
employees
working
there
might
have
perfectly
satisfactory
arrangement
as
far
as
their
concerned,
but
the
retiree
wants
more,
he
wants
more
for
himself
so
he
bands
together
and
forms
a
union
to
come
in
and
negotiate,
but
he
does
not
have
any
understanding
under
the
act
because
under
the
act
as
it
is
structured
as
the
court
below
held
that
the
bargain
relationship
exists
in
between
the
employer
and
his
current
employees.
mr.
guy
farmer
i
would
say
it
would
be
limited
to
a
suit
for
violation
of
the
agreement
which
could
be
a
class
action
or
what
we
have
here
under
section
301.
now
they
can
when
they
are
in
active
status
they
can
negotiate
these
benefits,
they
can
provide
for
their
investing
as
here
the
pensions
are
invested
in
this
company
after
15
years.
nobody
can
take
those
away
from
the
ones
they
have
invested
and
they
have
served
the
15
years
and
then
retired
and
if
they
were
taken
away
or
reduced
they
would
have
their
remedy
in
court
to
protect
their
beneficial
interests
and
there
are
many
cases
which
so
hold,
but
to
say
that
they
can
come
to
the
employer
they
have
let's
say
retired
with
$250
a
month
pension
based
on
the
pension
plan
in
effect
they
come
to
him
five
years
later
and
say
we
think
this
ought
to
be
five
hundred
and
we
banded
together
and
now
we
are
going
to
picket
you
until
you
agree
to
pay.
i
think
this
is
outside
the
contemplation
of
the
statute
which
is
supposed
to
resolve
of
all
ongoing
issues
between,
in
our
industrial
society,
between
employers
and
their
current
work
force
of
employees.
and
i
think
that
every
word
in
the
act
and
every
decision
up
to
now
has
been
consistent
with
that
interpretation
of
it
and
inconsistent
with
the
view
that
a
union
representing
active
employees
can
not
only
negotiate
their
benefits
to
take
effect
when
they
retire,
but
can
reach
out
and
renegotiate
without
limitation,
not
just
once
but
any
number
of
times
the
benefits
that
the
employee
retired
with.
as
i
said
earlier
i
do
not
think
--
i
think
that
this
creates
a
an
unfair
burden
on
employers
to
expose
him
to
this
risk
indefinitely
when
he
cannot
got
back
and
say
alright
i
will
have
to
adjust
my
price
levels
in
order
to
pay
those
things
retroactively.
now
the
industrial
practice
is
very
spotty
as
i
read
the
various
amicus
briefs.
there
are
some
companies
do
negotiate
these
things
with
their
unions,
some
do
not,
some
discuss
them
with
them
and
work
them
out
on
an
amicable
basis
but
to
say
that
the
act
will
be
in
effect
amended
by
some
kind
of
industrial
practice
i
think
is
contrary
to
normal
rules
of
the
statutory
interpretations.
thank
you.
