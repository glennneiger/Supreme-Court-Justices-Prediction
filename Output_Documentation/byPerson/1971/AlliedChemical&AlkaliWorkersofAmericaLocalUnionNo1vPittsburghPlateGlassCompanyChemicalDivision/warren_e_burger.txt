mr.
come
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
going
back
to
the
hypothetical
that
mr.
justice
white
suggested
to
you
about
the
union
exercising
this
power
to
negotiate
a
reduction
in
benefits
previously
pre
defined.
it
seems
to
me
i
recall
some
court
of
appeals
cases
that
have
referred
to
this
in
terms
of
the
possible
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
of
the
union
towards
its
members?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
should
the
board
have
jurisdiction
of
that
or
that
be
a
suit
under
301
or
where
will
it
be?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
come.
mr.
riemer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
union
has
something
in
the
nature
of
club
facilities
as
some
of
them
do,
are
they
permitted
to
use
all
those
facilities
generally?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
this
means
the
suggestion
that
the
active
membership
of
the
union
might
sell
the
retirees
down
the
river
sometime?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
see
you
think
it
meets
the
suggestion
and
answers
that
there
is
no
likelihood
that
the
actives
are
going
to
sell
all
the
retirees
down
the
river?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
if
they
did
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
there
is
some
possibility
if
they
did,
at
least
if
not
a
301
action
that
would
be
an
accountability
as
fiduciary,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
farmer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
framer
as
a
practical
matter
when
you
are
dealing
with
a
large
number
of
retired
employees,
this
was
fairly
large
number,
190
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
190.
if
they
have
no
access
to
bargaining
to
their
union
of
which
they
are
honorary
members,
does
that
mean
they
must
bring
a
class
action
or
must,
if
they
want
to
negotiate
they
must
band
together
in
some
sort
of
an
organization.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
if
they
did,
could
they
require
the
employer
to
negotiate
with?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
some
of
them
have
done
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
read
the
union's
claim
here
on
the
board’s
position
as
permitting
the
union
to
have
a
strike
issue
if
the
union
made
a
demand
for
an
increase
in
pensions
of
retired
employees
and
that
is
refuses.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
can
implement
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
did
not
read
it
as
that
type
of
claim,
but
i
will
ask
counsel
in
rebuttal
to
clarify
that.
my
impression
was
that
their
claim
was
rather
narrow
that
the
company,
the
employer
cannot
unilaterally
make
any
changes
without
negotiating,
but
we
will
see
whether
the
claim
that
they
on
the
union
side
could
initiate
the
claim
for
increased
benefits
and
go
on
strike
if
they
were
denied?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that'd
be
a
very
important
distinction,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
farmer
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
farmer
in
your
view
would
a
union
honor
a
picket
line
consisting
exclusively
of
the
retired
employees
who
were
picketing
for
an
increase
in
pensions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
the
federal
(inaudible)
consideration
for
their
having
a
bargaining
representative
of
some
kind?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
mr.
farmer
that
these
190
employees
had
managed
in
some
way
to
get
together
and
engage
a
lawyer
and
designate
him
as
their
bargaining
representative
as
does
the
group
for
an
active
union,
the
effective
union.
isn't
the
real
question
whether
there
is
an
obligation
of
the
employer
to
engage
in
bargaining
on
the
--
(voice

chief

warren
e.

if
the
employer
arbitrarily
cut
the
pension
in
half
as
the
case,
what
in
your
view
would
be
remedy
if
the
employees
would
be
limited
to
sue
as
third
party
beneficiaries
of
the
contract

made?
