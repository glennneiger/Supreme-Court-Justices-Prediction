mr.
mortimer
riemer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
1950,
the
union
began
to
put
together
a
comprehensive
program
of
retirement
benefits
for
the
employees
of
the
company
at
its
barberton,
ohio
plant.
the
first
insurance
program,
one
of
hospitalization
and
surgical
benefits
was
in
oral
agreement.
by
1960,
this
became
a
written
document,
supplementing
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
1960
written
agreement
provided
for
hospitalization
and
surgical
program
was
non
contributory
and
in
1962,
the
first
contributory
program
was
executed
by
the
parties
under
which
the
company
agreed
to
contribute
two-dollars
per
month
per
employee,
per
retiree.
the
cost
was
otherwise
borne
by
deductions
from
the
pension
check
of
the
retiree.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
yes
sir.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
they
remained
your
honor,
mr.
justice
brennan,
they
remained
honorary
members.
they
have
no
other
obligation
to
the
union.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
they
pay
no
dues.
they
are
considered
honorary
members
without
the
payment
to
dues.
they
have
the
right
to
visit
meetings,
attend
meetings.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
but
not
to
vote.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
well,
your
honor,
some
years
ago
the
union
was
going
to
start
such
a
program,
but
it
was
abandoned
because
of
cost.
now
what
they
do,
the
retirees
do
use
the
union
meeting
hall
as
congregating
place.
it
is
very
ample
for
that
purpose,
but
there
is
no
recreational
program
as
such.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
yes,
the
insurance
program?
yes
sir,
equitable
life
insurance
society,
mosley
carriers.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
yes
indeed,
they
do,
your
honor.
i
could
mention
many
that
do
and
it
is
a
definite
program
of
many
unions.
this
small
independent
union
had
never
been
able
to
bear
the
financial
cost
of
such
a
program.
what
i
want
to
say
mr.
chief
justice
and
to
the
members
of
the
court
is
that
from
1950
down
to
1964,
this
insurance
program
was
a
negotiated
program
and
it
usually
reached
at
or
about
the
time
collective
bargain
negotiations
were
entered
into
and
adjustments
were
made
to
the
pension
agreement.
so
it
was
not
a
loose
and
formal
arrangement,
but
it
was
a
firmly
bargained
arrangement,
particularly
the
1962
and
the
1964
agreement.
now
in
1962
and
i
think
this
the
most
significant,
when
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
was
negotiated,
when
changes
were
made
and
the
pension
agreement,
the
company
exacted
from
the
union
a
promise
as
part
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
retirement
would
become
mandatory
at
the
age
65,
effective
in
1964
and
at
that
point
it
seems
to
me
the
union
members
must
look
to
the
union,
the
retiree
must
look
to
the
union.
for
some
quid
pro
if
i
am
going
to
be
forced
to
retire
when
i
reach
the
age
of
65
then
at
least
i
must
look
to
the
union
to
be
sure
the
bargain
for
program
on
surgical
benefits,
on
hospitalizations
benefits
is
going
to
be
carried
out
and
if
there
are
going
to
be
any
changes
in
what
the
union
bargained
for
me,
since
i
must
retire
at
the
age
of
65
then
i
must
rely
upon
the
union
to
accomplish
those
changes.
but
what
happened
in
between
1950
and
1964
as
i
related
was
consistent
with
what
was
happening
throughout
the
entire
industrial
movement
and
this
brings
me
to
one
point
that
i
should
like
to
make,
and
that
is
to
deprive
what
i
think
is
a
misleading
effort
on
the
part
of
the
company
to
challenge
the
statistics
and
studies
which
have
been
included
in
the
briefs
of
the
board
and
the
brief
the
union
and
then
the
amici
briefs.
we
think
we
had
the
right,
we
think
we
had
the
right
to
call
to
this
court's
attention
of
luminous
studies
of
the
department
of
labor,
other
authentic
information,
showing
the
growth
of
the
industrial
practice
of
bargaining
about
hospitalization
and
surgical
benefits
for
retirees.
and
under
to
this
court's
decision
in
vaca
against
sipes
and
in
fiberboard
i
think
there
is
ample
authority
to
sustain
what
was
done.
the
1964
agreement,
your
honor,
was
a
firmly
bargained
agreement.
it
had
three
years
to
go,
expiring
in
1967
and
supplementing
that
collective
bargaining
agreement
was
the
insurance
agreement
in
the
appendix
was
co-terminus,
this
too
had
three
years
to
run,
subject
only
to
a
deficiency
if
you
want
to
call
it
that,
that
effective
with
medicare,
the
company
would
reclaim
the
two-dollar
additional
contribution
which
it
had
agreed
to
1964
and
so
it
is
understandable
with
the
approaching
effective
date
of
medicare
and
its
impact
upon
the
active
employees
now
retiring.
the
union
was
in
a
position
to
inquire
and
asked
did
the
company
proposed
to
do,
come
july
1966
when
medicare
became
effective?
the
union
had
bargained
for
these
benefits
for
these
people
when
they
were
active.
the
benefits
were
being
enjoyed
now
that
they
were
retired
and
they
have
assumed
a
continuing
responsibility
to
these
retired
employees
which
could
not
be
awaited.
and
so
in
november
1965.
this
was
an
entirely
plausible
and
understandable
and
i
think
correct
from
the
trade
union
point
of
view,
inquiry
to
make
of
a
company,
what
you
propose
to
do
in
1966
when
medicare
becomes
effective.
the
company
replied,
we
are
going
to
cancel
because
medicare
has
made
this
program
useless.
we
are
going
to
take
back
the
two
dollars
and
we
are
going
to
contribute
three
dollars
to
medicare.
this
was
challenged
sharply
by
the
union
and
had
it
not
been
at
that
point,
had
it
not
been
for
the
challenge
of
the
union,
the
entire
company
program
in
barberton
would
have
been
canceled.
not
only
retirees
eligible
for
social
security
would
have
lost
the
advantage
of
their
insurance,
but
retirees
who
are
not
eligible
for
social
security
or
medicare
because
they
were
below
the
age
of
65
and
their
spouses
too
would
have
lost
their
insurance.
but
for
the
intervening
and
necessary
act
of
the
union
this
was
prevented
and
two
days
later
the
company
came
in
with
a
new
program
of
no
cancellation,
but
refusing
to
consider
or
discuss
with
the
union
any
modification
of
the
insurance
program
effective
on
medicare
became
--
went
into
effect
in
july
of
1966.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
yes.
i
think
a
suit
for
breach
of
contract
might
have
been
brought
your
honor.
i
think
the
individuals
might
have
brought
a
301
action.
if
i
may
suggest
--
mr.
mortimer
riemer
yes
in
the
side
agreement
--
mr.
mortimer
riemer
there
was
a
never
any
attempt
to
arbitrate.
the
union
filed
no
grievance.
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
does
contain
a
very
comprehensive
grievance
and
arbitration
procedure.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
i
should
think
it
would
be,
but
i
do
not
think
it
is
normally
right.
i
think
it
said
your
honor
on
the
part
of
the
employer
to
--
well,
to
refuse
to
arbitrate,
to
refuse
to
file
the
grievance
procedure
i
think
is
an
8
(a)
(5),
and
normally
this
does
not
occur,
at
least
in
my
experience.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
well,
the
interest
to
the
act
of
the
employees,
your
honor,
mr.
justice
brennan
effected
by
this,
it
seems
to
me
somewhat
of
manciple
view.
the
union
rode
into
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
a
mandatory
retirement
provision.
the
active
employees
had
the
right
to
look
to
the
future
or
a
program
of
benefits
that
would
be
rewarded
and
perhaps
above
the
mere
poverty
level.
the
dollar
value
of
this
hospitalization
and
surgical
program
together
with
a
reduced
life
insurance
program
is
of
some
monetary
value.
the
active
employees
know
that
this
cost
is
something
that
they
have
been
given
up
in
order
that
they
may
in
the
future
recoup
in
a
sort
of
deferred
way
what
they
have
given
up
while
active
employees.
i
think
this
is
all
inscrutably
intertwined
--
mr.
mortimer
riemer
--
one
generates
another.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
i
believe
that
is
true,
your
honor.
the
more
advantages
provisions
that
can
be
made
for
the
retiree,
the
more
the
active
employee
anticipates
that
upon
reaching
the
age
of
65,
he
will
enjoy
no
less
than
the
retiree
--
mr.
mortimer
riemer
mr.
chief
justice,
absolutely
not.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
complete
confidence
that
the
union
would
not
permit
active
employees
to
sell
retired
employees
down
river.
i
do
not
think
any
union
itself
would
dare
to
take
that
position.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
and
if
they
did
--
mr.
mortimer
riemer
there
would
be
an
accountability,
legally
and
politically.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
1950,
the

began
to
put

a

the

was
going

but
it
was
abandoned
because
of

now
what
they
do,
the
retirees
do
use
the
union
meeting
hall
as
congregating
place.
it
is
very
ample
for
that
purpose,
but
there
is
no
recreational
program
as
such.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
yes,
the
insurance
program?
yes
sir,
equitable
life

mosley

mr.

yes
indeed,
they
do,
your

i
could
mention
many

the
financial

of

what
i
want
to
say
mr.
chief
justice
and
to
the
members
of
the
court
is
that
from
1950
down
to
1964,
this
insurance
program
was
a
negotiated
program
and
it
usually
reached
at
or
about
the
time
collective
bargain
negotiations
were
entered
into
and
adjustments
were
made
to
the
pension
agreement.
so
it
was
not
a
loose
and
formal
arrangement,
but
it
was
a
firmly
bargained
arrangement,
particularly
the
1962
and
the
1964

now
in

it

me
the

must
look

the
retiree
must
look
to
the
union.
for
some
quid

if
i
am
going

mr.

yes.
i
think
a

might
have
been
brought

i
think
the

might
have

if
i
may
suggest
--
mr.
mortimer
riemer
yes
in
the
side

--
mr.
mortimer
riemer
there
was
a
never
any
attempt
to
arbitrate.
the
union
filed
no
grievance.
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
does
contain
a
very
comprehensive
grievance
and
arbitration
procedure.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
i
should
think
it
would
be,
but
i
do
not
think
it
is
normally
right.
i
think
it
said
your
honor
on
the
part
of
the
employer
to
--
well,
to
refuse
to
arbitrate,
to
refuse
to
file
the
grievance
procedure
i
think
is
an
8
(a)
(5),
and
normally
this
does
not
occur,
at
least
in
my
experience.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
well,
the
interest
to
the
act
of
the
employees,
your
honor,
mr.
justice
brennan
effected
by
this,
it
seems
to
me
somewhat
of
manciple
view.
the
union
rode
into
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
a
mandatory
retirement
provision.
the
active
employees
had
the
right
to
look
to
the
future
or
a
program
of
benefits
that
would
be
rewarded
and
perhaps
above
the
mere
poverty
level.
the
dollar
value
of
this
hospitalization
and
surgical
program
together
with
a
reduced
life
insurance
program
is
of
some
monetary
value.
the
active
employees
know
that
this
cost
is
something
that
they
have
been
given
up
in
order
that
they
may
in
the
future
recoup
in
a
sort
of
deferred
way
what
they
have
given
up
while
active
employees.
i
think
this
is
all
inscrutably
intertwined
--
mr.
mortimer
riemer
--
one
generates
another.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
i
believe
that
is
true,
your
honor.
the
more
advantages
provisions
that
can
be
made
for
the
retiree,
the
more
the
active
employee
anticipates
that
upon
reaching
the
age
of
65,
he
will
enjoy
no
less
than
the
retiree
--
mr.
mortimer
riemer
mr.
chief
justice,
absolutely
not.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
complete
confidence
that
the
union
would
not
permit
active
employees
to
sell
retired
employees
down
river.
i
do
not
think
any
union
itself
would
dare
to
take
that
position.
mr.
mortimer
riemer
and
if
they
did
--
mr.
mortimer
riemer
there
would
be
an
accountability,
legally
and
politically.
