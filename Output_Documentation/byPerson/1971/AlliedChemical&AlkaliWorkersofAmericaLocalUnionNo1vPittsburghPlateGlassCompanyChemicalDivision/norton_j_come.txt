mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
which
denied
enforcement
of
the
board's
bargaining
order.
the
question
presented
is
whether
an
employer
violates
his
bargaining
obligation
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
by
refusing
to
bargain
with
the
union
representative
of
his
employees
about
the
changes
in
health
benefits
which
the
employer
proposes
to
negotiate
with
employees
who
have
already
retired.
now
the
basic
facts
are
these.
since
1949,
local
one
of
the
allied
chemical
workers
of
america
has
been
the
bargaining
representative
for
all
hourly
employees
at
the
barberton,
ohio
plant
of
the
pittsburgh
plate
glass
company.
in
1950,
the
union
and
the
company
negotiated
a
contract
which
for
the
first
time
included
provisions
for
pension
and
hospitalization
and
surgical
insurance
plan.
at
the
same
time
the
parties
orally
agreed
that
the
employees
who
retired
could
participate
in
the
medical
plan
by
contributing
the
entire
cost
of
the
insurance
premium
which
would
be
deducted
from
their
pensions.
in
1959,
retiree
benefits
under
the
plan
were
improved
and
as
a
result
of
contract
negotiations
1962,
the
medical
insurance
plan
became
contributory
for
the
first
time.
the
company
agreeing
to
two
dollars
towards
the
cost
of
insurance
premiums
for
employees
who
retired
in
future.
this
was
available
to
both
the
retiree
and
spouse.
at
the
same
time
a
change
was
made
in
the
pension
plan
to
make
65
the
mandatory
retirement
age.
a
new
contract
was
negotiated
in
1964
and
that
forms
the
basis
for
this
case.
at
that
time
the
company
agreed
to
increase
its
monthly
contribution
of
medical
insurance
from
two
dollars
to
four
dollars.
the
increase
was
made
available
not
only
to
employees
who
retired
after
the
effective
date
of
the
contract,
but
also
to
each
participating
employer
or
employee
in
the
health
plan,
who
had
retired
on
or
after
the
effective
date
of
the
1962
contract,
in
other
words
it
went
back
indefinitely
to
reach
employees
who
had
already
retired.
in
anticipation
of
the
enactment
of
medicare,
however,
the
agreement
further
provided
that
the
company
could
rescind
the
two-dollar
increase
in
its
contribution,
if
a
government
health
program
were
enacted.
now,
congress
enacted
medicare
on
july
30,
1965.
this
contract
as
i
said
was
negotiated
in
1964
and
by
its
terms
it
had
until
october
of
1967,
before
it
would
terminate.
in
november
of
1965,
the
union
asked
the
company
to
engaged
in
bargaining
for
the
purpose
of
negotiating
insurance
benefits
not
covered
by
medicare.
the
company
responded
several
months
later
by
stating
that
the
because
of
enactment
of
medicare
it
intended
to
rescind
the
two-dollar
extra
contribution
that
it
was
making
to
the
health
insurance
plan
and
it
intended
as
a
matter
of
fact
to
cancel
the
medical
insurance
plan
for
retirees
entirely
because
the
enactment
of
medicare
would
render
the
company
insurance
plan
useless.
instead
the
company
said
that
it
would
pay
the
three-dollars
per
month
subscription
cost
of
supplemental
medicare
for
each
retired
employee
who
elected
that
and
decided
to
leave
the
company
plan.
the
union
conceded
that
under
the
contract,
the
company
by
virtue
of
its
reservation
had
the
right
to
reduce
its
contribution
to
the
health
and
welfare
plan
from
four
dollars
to
two
dollars.
however,
the
union
vigorously
protested
the
company’s
further
action
in
canceling
the
company
plan
all
together.
and
the
union
further
inquired
what
provision
did
the
company
intend
to
make
for
those
pensioners
and
their
wives
who
are
under
65
and
not
eligible
for
medicare
at
all.
the
company
challenged
the
union’s
right
to
bargain
about
retirees
and
acknowledged
that
there
was
a
problem
about
the
pensioner
who
would
not
--
or
were
not
eligible
for
65
and
said
that
they
have
to
think
about
that.
several
days
later,
the
company
informed
the
union
that
it
would
not
cancel
the
medical
plan
for
retired
employees.
instead
it
would
write
each
retiree
notifying
of
the
pendency
of
medicare
and
indicating
that
it
would
give
it
the
option
for
either
remaining
under
the
company
plan
with
reduced
contribution
of
two-dollars
on
the
part
of
the
company
or
getting
out
of
the
company
plan
in
which
case
the
company
would
pay
the
three-dollars
supplemental
medicare
subscriptions.
the
union
objected
on
the
ground
that
such
change
should
be
the
matter
of
negotiations
and
could
not
be
done
unilaterally
by
the
company.
the
company
took
the
position,
the
reiterated
position
and
said
we
will
not
apply
the
matter
and
went
ahead
and
bid
to
contact
the
retirees
individually
about
the
offer.
as
a
result
out
of
15
out
of
the
190
retirees
availed
itself
of
the
company's
option,
the
remainder
remained
under
the
old
plan
with
the
reduced
employee
contribution.
the
union
thereupon
filed
charges
with
the
board
alleging
that
the
company's
refusal
to
bargain
about
the
changes
in
the
health
plan
for
the
retirees
violated
the
company's
bargaining
obligation
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
board
sustained
the
complaint
which
is
an
issued
by
the
board's
general
counsel,
agreeing
with
the
union's
contention
that
company
had
violated
its
bargaining
obligation.
there
were
two
basis
for
the
board's
decision.
first
of
all
that
retirees
remained
employees
under
the
act
for
purposes
of
their
retirement
benefits
and
secondly
that
even
if
they
were
not
employees,
there
was
the
duty
to
bargain
about
this
matter
because
changes
in
retirement
benefits
had
a
direct
and
vital
impact
on
the
terms
and
conditions
of
the
employment
of
the
active
employees
as
to
whom
there
was
clearly
a
bargaining
obligation.
the
board
entered
an
appropriate
order.
the
six
circuit
denied
enforcement
of
the
board’s
order
and
we
are
here.
now
we
submit
that
the
six
circuit
erred
for
two
basic
reasons
which
i
will
try
to
develop.
section
8
(a)
(5)
and
8
(d)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
imposes
on
the
employer
and
the
representative
of
his
employees
the
obligation
to
bargain
with
each
other
in
good
faith
with
respect
to
wages,
hours
and
other
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
by
now
it
is
well
established
that
employers
are
obligated
to
bargain
with
union
representative
about
pensions
and
insurance
benefits
to
be
enjoyed
by
active
employees
upon
their
retirement
and
indeed
a
large
percentage
of
union
represented
employees
are
currently
working
under
negotiated
pensions
and
retirement
plans.
however,
experience
and
the
facts
of
this
case
show
that
retirement
benefits
once
negotiated
do
not
remain
static,
but
they
are
subject
to
unanticipated
events
even
after
the
employee
has
retired.
monetary
inflation
is
one
obvious
unanticipated
event.
the
other
one,
a
change
in
public
law,
in
this
case
illustrates
that
because
at
the
time
that
the
parties
originally
hammered
out
a
health
insurance
plan
nobody
contemplated
what
effect
medicare
would
have
on
it.
so
the
question
presented
here
is
whether
when
these
changes
are
to
be
made
in
the
benefits
of
employees
that
have
retired,
the
employer
must
bargain
with
the
union
on
behalf
of
the
employees,
of
the
retired
employees
about
those
changes
just
as
it
did
with
the
union
when
they
were
originally
negotiated
or
whether
it
is
one
of
the
three
and
act
unilateral.
now
this
court
in
the
fiber
board
case
indicated
that
industrial
practice
in
this
country
is
a
very
important
consideration
in
determining
whether
a
matter
is
a
mandatory
subject
of
collective
bargaining
and
further
the
amenability
of
the
subject
to
the
collective
bargaining
processes
of
the
act.
this
experience
we
submit,
supports
the
board's
conclusion,
the
changes
in
retiree
benefits
are
a
mandatory
subject
of
collective
bargaining
because
as
shown
in
the
amicus
brief
that
has
been
filed
by
the
afl
and
cio
and
by
the
senior
citizen's
committee.
employers
and
unions
have
for
many
years
regularly
and
consistently
bargained
not
only
about
the
pension
and
retirement
benefits
for
active
employees
to
be
enjoyed
upon
their
retirement,
but
also
upon
improvements
in
the
benefits
for
employees
who
have
already
retired.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
you
honor
i
think
that
that
is
basic
to
the
board's
argument.
that
was
certainly
the
basis
on
which
the
pension
and
retirement
benefits
were
held
for
active
employee
to
be
enjoyed
upon
retirement
was
found
to
be
within
wages,
hours
and
terms
and
conditions
and
to
carry
that
to
retirees
is
just
a
what
we
submit
as
a
natural
progression,
it
is
a
part
of
the
wage.
now
both
the
company
and
the
union
however
arrived
at
a
contrary
conclusion,
principally
in
this
fashion.
they
say
section
8
(a)
(5)
of
the
act
requires
the
employer
to
bargain
with
the
representative
of
his
employees,
subject
to
the
provisions
of
section
9
(a)
which
in
turn
makes
the
representative
selected
by
a
majority
of
the
employees
in
an
appropriate
unit,
the
exclusive
representative
of
all
the
employees
in
the
section.
now
since
retirees
are
no
longer
on
the
payroll
of
the
employer
and
the
board
does
not
permit
them
to
vote
in
a
representation
election,
the
argument
runs
they
cannot
be
regarded
as
his
employees
or
employees
in
such
units
within
the
meaning
of
section
8
(a)
(5)
and
section
9
(a).
we
submit
that
there
is
not
warrant
for
such
a
restrictive
interpretation
of
the
terms
employee
and
unit.
however,
if
we
prevail
on
our
first
argument,
namely
that
there
is
a
duty
to
bargain
about
the
benefits
paid
to
retirees
because
of
the
direct
impact
that
it
has
on
the
benefits
of
the
active
employees,
we
do
not
even
have
to
reach
the,
what
is
the
principle
thrust
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
of
the
company
here.
that
comes
in
only
on
the
second
prong
to
the
board's
argument,
namely
that
in
any
event
a
retiree
still
remains
employee
for
purposes
of
the
retirement
benefit.
mr.
norton
j.
come
they
were
required
by
an
agreement.
what
the
company
did
was
they
negotiated
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
then
they
at
the
same
time
executed
a
side
agreement
covering
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
with
the
union.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
a
correct
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
for
breach
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
perhaps
under
--
probably
under
301.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
any
doubt.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yeah,
breach
of
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
the
logic
of
my
argument
would
cover
that
as
well.
mr.
norton
j.
come
if
(voice
overlap)
however
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
(voice
overlap)
i
think
you
then
get
into
problems
of
breach
of
the
duty
of
their
representation.
question
as
to
whether
or
not
if
the
thing
is
invested
any
such
agreement
is
going
to
be
one
of
the
in
person.
however,
when
the
employer
is
free
to
act
unilaterally,
you
got
the
same
problem.
the
only
question
is
whether
you
reach
it
as
a
result
of
the
employer's
unilateral
action
or
as
a
result
of
collective
bargaining.
i
think
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
they
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
they
could
also
have
an
action
against
the
union
for
breach
of
the
duty
of
their
representation.
however,
we
do
not
have
anything
like
that
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
union
would
bring
itself
afoul
of
that
line
of
the
decisions.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
it
would
be
a
suit
in
the
courts
as
an
independent
suit
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
along
the
line
tungsten
steel
cases.
it
might
be
under
launder
and
griffin.
the
board
could
also
have
jurisdiction
under
that
under
its
miranda
line
of
decisions
which
has
held
that
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
on
the
part
of
the
union
is
a
violation
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
i
think
there
are
a
whole
host
of
remedies
for
the
situation
of
a
union
that
would
be
so
unwise
as
to
negotiate
a
reduction
of
retiree
benefits.
the
experience
that
is
shown
as
to
the
way
the
bargaining
has
taken
place
in
this
area
which
i
refer
the
court
to
amicus
briefs
for
it
shows
that
invariably
negotiations
have
resulted
in
an
increase
in
retirement
benefits.
there
have
been
no
instance
that
i
have
been
able
to
find
where
there
has
been
such
a
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
we
do
not
--
that
is
the
board
does
not
get
into
the
question
as
to
whether
in
act
there
has
been
a
breach
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
there
would
have
been
a
remedy,
but
there
could
it
be
concurrent
remedy.
there
are
some
reaches
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
they
also
be
a
breach
of
the
duty
to
bargain
collectively
under
8
(a)
(5)
of
the
national
labor
relation
act
and
that
is
what
we
submit
we
have
here.
now
i
would
like
to
develop
for
a
moment
our
first
line
of
argument
here
that
without
regard
to
the
question
of
whether
the
retiree
remains
an
employee
or
not,
the
active
employees
are
clearly
the
company’s
employees
and
they
are
included
in
the
unit
which
the
union
represents.
the
company,
there
is
no
question
is
required
to
bargain
with
the
union,
respecting
their
wages,
hours
and
other
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
now
this
obligation
includes
the
employment
conditions
of
persons
outside
the
unit
where
they
have
a
direct
impact
on
the
conditions
of
the
employees
within
the
union
unit,
and
therefore,
the
company
i
submit,
is
wholly
accurate
in
saying
that
the
bargaining
unit
finds
the
boundaries
of
the
bargaining
obligation
and
concludes
the
scope
of
the
bargain.
this
court's
decision
in
the
oliver
case,
we
submit,
establishes
the
proposition
--
the
contrary
proposition
because
in
oliver
as
the
court
will
recall,
it
held
that
a
bargaining
unit,
including
an
overwhelming
majority
of
concededly
employed
drivers
of
carry
your
own
equipment
was
entitled
under
section
8
(b)
of
the
national
labor
relation
act.
the
bargain
to
impasse
concerning
the
minimum
rentals
to
be
received
by
owner-drivers
when
they
became
leasees
of
the
carrier
and
as
the
court
explained
in
the
drum
case,
it
is
holding
in
oliver,
said
“it
was
not
necessary
to
determine
whether
the
owner-drivers
were
employees
protected
by
the
act
since
the
establishment
of
the
minimal
rental
to
them
was
integral
to
the
establishment
of
a
stable
wage
structure
were
clearly
covered
employee
drivers.
now
we
submit
here
that
so
here
the
benefits
paid
to
retirees
are
integral
to
the
establishment
of
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
are
clearly
covered
active
employees.
and
if
we
are
right
on
this
point,
we
think
that
that
is
enough
to
sustain
the
board's
as
position
without
more.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
now
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
we
submit,
no
your
honor
for
this
reason.
there
is
a
very
close
relationship
here
between
the
benefits
paid
to
the
actives
and
adjustments
in
retiree
benefits.
it
is
true
that
it
does
not
involve
a
loss
of
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
loss
of
jobs
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
when
we
say
immediate
threat
to
wages
i
think
that
is
where
we
would
differ
with
the
company
here
because
the
adjustments
that
are
made
in
the
benefits
for
retired
employees
directly
affect
the
bargain
that
is
going
to
be
made
for
the
active
employees.
if
the
adjustments
made
for
retirees
are
too
liberal,
as
obviously
it
is
going
to
be
less
in
the
path
where
the
active
employees
because
the
employers
generally
allocate
a
certain
amount
for
their
total
labor
cost
fixed
beyond
that.
the
active
employee
being
aware
of
these
unanticipated
changes
is
going
to
look
to
what
the
retiree
is
getting.
if
there
is
a
history
in
this
plan
of
negotiation
to
improve
the
retirement
benefits,
the
active
employees
will
might
well
be
willing
to
settle
for
a
fixed
retirement
plan
and
a
mandatory
retirement
age,
living
the
negotiations,
the
ironing
out
of
the
unanticipated
events
develop
in
the
future.
if
there
is
not
this
history
of
bargaining
or
this
possibility
of
bargaining,
the
chances
are
that
the
active
employees
are
going
to
insist
upon
some
kind
of
a
flexible
retirement
plan
where
the
cost
of
living
escalates
across.
this
is
going
to
make
it
much
harder
to
get
a
bargain
for
the
active
employees
so
that
there
is
a
very
close
relationship
here
between
the
bargaining
for
the
active
employees
and
the
adjustment
in
retiree
benefits.
i
should
like
to
save
the
balance
of
my
time
for
the
rebuttal
and
leave
the
briefs
secondly
to
the
my
arguments.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
your
honor,
i
think
might
as
well
start
with
that
precise
holding
of
the
board
in
this
case
that
at
pages
46
and
47
of
the
appendix
and
the
board
reading
down
toward
the
middle
there
says
“accordingly
we
find
that
by
unilaterally
modifying
its
medical
insurance
plan
for
retired
employees
respondent
violated
section
8
(a)
(5)
and
one
of
the
act.
mr.
norton
j.
come
46,
the
last
sentence
of
the
first
paragraph
accordingly
and
then
at
the
bottom
of
the
next
paragraph
the
board
says
we
hold
only
on
the
record
this
case
that
the
respondent
violated
statute
by
making
unilateral
changes
and
then
finding
three
on
page
47
by
instituting
unilateral
adjustments
in
the
health
insurance
plan
for
its
retired
employees.
now
i
think
that
is
the
factual
setting
of
this
case
and
a
precise
holding
of
the
board.
i
think
however
that
candor
requires
me
to
point
out
that
although
that
is
not
this
case
that
the
logic
of
upholding
that
this
is
a
mandatory
subject
of
bargaining
would
mean
that
in
a
case
where
you
did
not
have
employer
making
a
unilateral
adjustment,
but
the
union
proposes
a
change
in
the
retiree
benefits.
there
would
be
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
assuming
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
is
the
logic
of
the
board's
holding
here.
i
do
not
think
that
is
what
it
held
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
all
that
i
say
however
pre
supposes
that
under
the
contract
will
not
preclude
a
reopening.
i
mean,
obviously
if
there
is
a
contract
in
an
effect
that
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
what
does
means
is,
your
honor
is
that
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
facts,
the
contract
here
had
two
years
i
believe
to
go.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
now
under
8
(b)
neither
party
is
obliged
to
discuss
reopening
of
the
terms
fixed,
however,
since
the
company
agreed
to
reconsider
the
effects
of
medicare,
the
matter,
it
did
not
effect
waived
its
right
to
say
no
we
are
not
going
to
talk
about
this
while
the
contract
is
still
on
effect
and
at
that
point
it
became
a
bargainable
matter.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
and
of
course
the
way
the.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
but
of
course
the
way
that
the
problem
is
most
likely
to
arise
is
judged
by
the
experience
in
the
area
is
going
to
be
in
the
context
of
your
having
negotiated
a
health
and
welfare
or
pension
plan
that
is
going
to
cover
active
employees
and
retirees.
and
then
as
a
result
of
unforeseen
changes
either
the
employer
or
the
union
is
going
to
bring
up
the
question
whether
it'd
be
at
the
time
that
you
negotiate
a
new
contract
or
whether
in
the
course
of
an
old
one
that
can
be
reopened,
the
question
of
adjusting
to
these
unexpected,
unforeseen
changes
and
the
questions
and
these
adjustments
are
made
today
so
that
the
question
is
should
the
employer
although
up
to
now
as
our
data
shows,
he
has
been
willing
to
bargain
about
it,
should
he
be
permitted
to
say
that
from
here
on
i
am
going
to
do
it
unilaterally,
that
is
what
this
case
boils
down
to.
now
we
are
not
seeking
to
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
but
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
him
however
from
improving
those
adjustments
and
those
provisions
and
the
question
is,
is
it
healthier
for
collective
bargaining
relationship
plus
the
impact,
including
the
impact
on
the
active
employees
for
these
improvements
to
be
negotiated
as
a
result
of
the
same
kind
of
bilateral
negotiations
that
went
into
formulating
them
to
begin
with
or
to
permit
the
employer
to
make
these
changes
unilaterally.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
(inaudible)
your
honor
i
just
want
to
say
without
being
overly
argumentative
that
part
of
the
reason
in
that
governs
whether
you
conclude
that
a
subject
is
a
mandatory
subject
of
collective
bargaining
or
not
is
whether
or
not
it
is
likely
to
be
a
bone
of
contention
between
labor
and
management
and
that
it
makes
for
industrial
peace
rather
than
strike
subjective
to
the
collective
bargaining
processes
of
the
act
and
that
is
all
that
i
meant
by
health
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
in
the
board's
view
your
honor
as
i
understand
it,
it
could.
whether
it
would
or
not
of
course
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
the
same
argument
could
have
been
made
and
was
made
by
the
employers
in
1947
when
they
were
protesting
the
extension
of
the
ex-bargaining
requirements,
the
bargaining
over
pensions
and
health
and
welfare
benefits.
there
is
a
whole
history
of
what
is
a
mandatory
subject
of
bargaining
has
been
an
evolving
one.
and
things
that
today
are
routinely
accepted
as
bargainable
in
1935
or
even
in
1947
were
looked
at
as
being
unheard
of
extension,
but
the
concept
does
grow
and
we
submit
that
this
a
reasonable
extension
of
the
holding
in
inland
steel
in
1947
that
the
whole
matter
of
pensions
and
health
and
welfare
matters
are
part
of
matter.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
the
board
would
find
that,
that
is
a
violation
of
8
(d).
the.
mr.
norton
j.
come
8
(d)
says
that
you
cannot
make
a
modification.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
an
8
(a)
(5)
via
8
(d).
mr.
norton
j.
come
no
other
reason.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
and
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
believe
that
is
right
on
that
aspect
oft
the
issue,
thank
you.
mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
which
denied
enforcement
of
the
board's
bargaining
order.
the
question
presented
is
whether
an
employer
violates
his
bargaining
obligation
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
by
refusing
to
bargain
with
the
union
representative
of
his
employees
about
the
changes
in
health
benefits
which
the
employer
proposes
to
negotiate
with
employees
who
have
already
retired.
now
the
basic
facts
are
these.
since
1949,
local
one
of
the
allied
chemical
workers
of
america
has
been
the
bargaining
representative
for
all
hourly
employees
at
the
barberton,
ohio
plant
of
the
pittsburgh
plate
glass
company.
in
1950,
the
union
and
the
company
negotiated
a
contract
which
for
the
first
time
included
provisions
for
pension
and
hospitalization
and
surgical
insurance
plan.
at
the
same
time
the
parties
orally
agreed
that
the
employees
who
retired
could
participate
in
the
medical
plan
by
contributing
the
entire
cost
of
the
insurance
premium
which
would
be
deducted
from
their
pensions.
in
1959,
retiree
benefits
under
the
plan
were
improved
and
as
a
result
of
contract
negotiations
1962,
the
medical
insurance
plan
became
contributory
for
the
first
time.
the
company
agreeing
to
two
dollars
towards
the
cost
of
insurance
premiums
for
employees
who
retired
in
future.
this
was
available
to
both
the
retiree
and
spouse.
at
the
same
time
a
change
was
made
in
the
pension
plan
to
make
65
the
mandatory
retirement
age.
a
new
contract
was
negotiated
in
1964
and
that
forms
the
basis
for
this
case.
at
that
time
the
company
agreed
to
increase
its
monthly
contribution
of
medical
insurance
from
two
dollars
to
four
dollars.
the
increase
was
made
available
not
only
to
employees
who
retired
after
the
effective
date
of
the
contract,
but
also
to
each
participating
employer
or
employee
in
the
health
plan,
who
had
retired
on
or
after
the
effective
date
of
the
1962
contract,
in
other
words
it
went
back
indefinitely
to
reach
employees
who
had
already
retired.
in
anticipation
of
the
enactment
of
medicare,
however,
the
agreement
further
provided
that
the
company
could
rescind
the
two-dollar
increase
in
its
contribution,
if
a
government
health
program
were
enacted.
now,
congress
enacted
medicare
on
july
30,
1965.
this
contract
as
i
said
was
negotiated
in
1964
and
by
its
terms
it
had
until
october
of
1967,
before
it
would
terminate.
in
november
of
1965,
the
union
asked
the
company
to
engaged
in
bargaining
for
the
purpose
of
negotiating
insurance
benefits
not
covered
by
medicare.
the
company
responded
several
months
later
by
stating
that
the
because
of
enactment
of
medicare
it
intended
to
rescind
the
two-dollar
extra
contribution
that
it
was
making
to
the
health
insurance
plan
and
it
intended
as
a
matter
of
fact
to
cancel
the
medical
insurance
plan
for
retirees
entirely
because
the
enactment
of
medicare
would
render
the
company
insurance
plan
useless.
instead
the
company
said
that
it
would
pay
the
three-dollars
per
month
subscription
cost
of
supplemental
medicare
for
each
retired
employee
who
elected
that
and
decided
to
leave
the
company
plan.
the
union
conceded
that
under
the
contract,
the
company
by
virtue
of
its
reservation
had
the
right
to
reduce
its
contribution
to
the
health
and
welfare
plan
from
four
dollars
to
two
dollars.
however,
the
union
vigorously
protested
the
company’s
further
action
in
canceling
the
company
plan
all
together.
and
the
union
further
inquired
what
provision
did
the
company
intend
to
make
for
those
pensioners
and
their
wives
who
are
under
65
and
not
eligible
for
medicare
at
all.
the
company
challenged
the
union’s
right
to
bargain
about
retirees
and
acknowledged
that
there
was
a
problem
about
the
pensioner
who
would
not
--
or
were
not
eligible
for
65
and
said
that
they
have
to
think
about
that.
several
days
later,
the
company
informed
the
union
that
it
would
not
cancel
the
medical
plan
for
retired
employees.
instead
it
would
write
each
retiree
notifying
of
the
pendency
of
medicare
and
indicating
that
it
would
give
it
the
option
for
either
remaining
under
the
company
plan
with
reduced
contribution
of
two-dollars
on
the
part
of
the
company
or
getting
out
of
the
company
plan
in
which
case
the
company
would
pay
the
three-dollars
supplemental
medicare
subscriptions.
the
union
objected
on
the
ground
that
such
change
should
be
the
matter
of
negotiations
and
could
not
be
done
unilaterally
by
the
company.
the
company
took
the
position,
the
reiterated
position
and
said
we
will
not
apply
the
matter
and
went
ahead
and
bid
to
contact
the
retirees
individually
about
the
offer.
as
a
result
out
of
15
out
of
the
190
retirees
availed
itself
of
the
company's
option,
the
remainder
remained
under
the
old
plan
with
the
reduced
employee
contribution.
the
union
thereupon
filed
charges
with
the
board
alleging
that
the
company's
refusal
to
bargain
about
the
changes
in
the
health
plan
for
the
retirees
violated
the
company's
bargaining
obligation
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
board
sustained
the
complaint
which
is
an
issued
by
the
board's
general
counsel,
agreeing
with
the
union's
contention
that
company
had
violated
its
bargaining
obligation.
there
were
two
basis
for
the
board's
decision.
first
of
all
that
retirees
remained
employees
under
the
act
for
purposes
of
their
retirement
benefits
and
secondly
that
even
if
they
were
not
employees,
there
was
the
duty
to
bargain
about
this
matter
because
changes
in
retirement
benefits
had
a
direct
and
vital
impact
on
the
terms
and
conditions
of
the
employment
of
the
active
employees
as
to
whom
there
was
clearly
a
bargaining
obligation.
the
board
entered
an
appropriate
order.
the
six
circuit
denied
enforcement
of
the
board’s
order
and
we
are
here.
now
we
submit
that
the
six
circuit
erred
for
two
basic
reasons
which
i
will
try
to
develop.
section
8
(a)
(5)
and
8
(d)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
imposes
on
the
employer
and
the
representative
of
his
employees
the
obligation
to
bargain
with
each
other
in
good
faith
with
respect
to
wages,
hours
and
other
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
by
now
it
is
well
established
that
employers
are
obligated
to
bargain
with
union
representative
about
pensions
and
insurance
benefits
to
be
enjoyed
by
active
employees
upon
their
retirement
and
indeed
a
large
percentage
of
union
represented
employees
are
currently
working
under
negotiated
pensions
and
retirement
plans.
however,
experience
and
the
facts
of
this
case
show
that
retirement
benefits
once
negotiated
do
not
remain
static,
but
they
are
subject
to
unanticipated
events
even
after
the
employee
has
retired.
monetary
inflation
is
one
obvious
unanticipated
event.
the
other
one,
a
change
in
public
law,
in
this
case
illustrates
that
because
at
the
time
that
the
parties
originally
hammered
out
a
health
insurance
plan
nobody
contemplated
what
effect
medicare
would
have
on
it.
so
the
question
presented
here
is
whether
when
these
changes
are
to
be
made
in
the
benefits
of
employees
that
have
retired,
the
employer
must
bargain
with
the
union
on
behalf
of
the
employees,
of
the
retired
employees
about
those
changes
just
as
it
did
with
the
union
when
they
were
originally
negotiated
or
whether
it
is
one
of
the
three
and
act
unilateral.
now
this
court
in
the
fiber
board
case
indicated
that
industrial
practice
in
this
country
is
a
very
important
consideration
in
determining
whether
a
matter
is
a
mandatory
subject
of
collective
bargaining
and
further
the
amenability
of
the
subject
to
the
collective
bargaining
processes
of
the
act.
this
experience
we
submit,
supports
the
board's
conclusion,
the
changes
in
retiree
benefits
are
a
mandatory
subject
of
collective
bargaining
because
as
shown
in
the
amicus
brief
that
has
been
filed
by
the
afl
and
cio
and
by
the
senior
citizen's
committee.
employers
and
unions
have
for
many
years
regularly
and
consistently
bargained
not
only
about
the
pension
and
retirement
benefits
for
active
employees
to
be
enjoyed
upon
their
retirement,
but
also
upon
improvements
in
the
benefits
for
employees
who
have
already
retired.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
you
honor
i
think
that
that
is
basic
to
the
board's
argument.
that
was
certainly
the
basis
on
which
the
pension
and
retirement
benefits
were
held
for
active
employee
to
be
enjoyed
upon
retirement
was
found
to
be
within
wages,
hours
and
terms
and
conditions
and
to
carry
that
to
retirees
is
just
a
what
we
submit
as
a
natural
progression,
it
is
a
part
of
the
wage.
now
both
the
company
and
the
union
however
arrived
at
a
contrary
conclusion,
principally
in
this
fashion.
they
say
section
8
(a)
(5)
of
the
act
requires
the
employer
to
bargain
with
the
representative
of
his
employees,
subject
to
the
provisions
of
section
9
(a)
which
in
turn
makes
the
representative
selected
by
a
majority
of
the
employees
in
an
appropriate
unit,
the
exclusive
representative
of
all
the
employees
in
the
section.
now
since
retirees
are
no
longer
on
the
payroll
of
the
employer
and
the
board
does
not
permit
them
to
vote
in
a
representation
election,
the
argument
runs
they
cannot
be
regarded
as
his
employees
or
employees
in
such
units
within
the
meaning
of
section
8
(a)
(5)
and
section
9
(a).
we
submit
that
there
is
not
warrant
for
such
a
restrictive
interpretation
of
the
terms
employee
and
unit.
however,
if
we
prevail
on
our
first
argument,
namely
that
there
is
a
duty
to
bargain
about
the
benefits
paid
to
retirees
because
of
the
direct
impact
that
it
has
on
the
benefits
of
the
active
employees,
we
do
not
even
have
to
reach
the,
what
is
the
principle
thrust
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
of
the
company
here.
that
comes
in
only
on
the
second
prong
to
the
board's
argument,
namely
that
in
any
event
a
retiree
still
remains
employee
for
purposes
of
the
retirement
benefit.
mr.
norton
j.
come
they
were
required
by
an
agreement.
what
the
company
did
was
they
negotiated
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
then
they
at
the
same
time
executed
a
side
agreement
covering
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
with
the
union.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
a
correct
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
for
breach
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
perhaps
under
--
probably
under
301.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
any
doubt.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yeah,
breach
of
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
the
logic
of
my
argument
would
cover
that
as
well.
mr.
norton
j.
come
if
(voice
overlap)
however
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
(voice
overlap)
i
think
you
then
get
into
problems
of
breach
of
the
duty
of
their
representation.
question
as
to
whether
or
not
if
the
thing
is
invested
any
such
agreement
is
going
to
be
one
of
the
in
person.
however,
when
the
employer
is
free
to
act
unilaterally,
you
got
the
same
problem.
the
only
question
is
whether
you
reach
it
as
a
result
of
the
employer's
unilateral
action
or
as
a
result
of
collective
bargaining.
i
think
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
they
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
they
could
also
have
an
action
against
the
union
for
breach
of
the
duty
of
their
representation.
however,
we
do
not
have
anything
like
that
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
union
would
bring
itself
afoul
of
that
line
of
the
decisions.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
it
would
be
a
suit
in
the
courts
as
an
independent
suit
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
along
the
line
tungsten
steel
cases.
it
might
be
under
launder
and
griffin.
the
board
could
also
have
jurisdiction
under
that
under
its
miranda
line
of
decisions
which
has
held
that
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
on
the
part
of
the
union
is
a
violation
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
i
think
there
are
a
whole
host
of
remedies
for
the
situation
of
a
union
that
would
be
so
unwise
as
to
negotiate
a
reduction
of
retiree
benefits.
the
experience
that
is
shown
as
to
the
way
the
bargaining
has
taken
place
in
this
area
which
i
refer
the
court
to
amicus
briefs
for
it
shows
that
invariably
negotiations
have
resulted
in
an
increase
in
retirement
benefits.
there
have
been
no
instance
that
i
have
been
able
to
find
where
there
has
been
such
a
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
we
do
not
--
that
is
the
board
does
not
get
into
the
question
as
to
whether
in
act
there
has
been
a
breach
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
there
would
have
been
a
remedy,
but
there
could
it
be
concurrent
remedy.
there
are
some
reaches
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
they
also
be
a
breach
of
the
duty
to
bargain
collectively
under
8
(a)
(5)
of
the
national
labor
relation
act
and
that
is
what
we
submit
we
have
here.
now
i
would
like
to
develop
for
a
moment
our
first
line
of
argument
here
that
without
regard
to
the
question
of
whether
the
retiree
remains
an
employee
or
not,
the
active
employees
are
clearly
the
company’s
employees
and
they
are
included
in
the
unit
which
the
union
represents.
the
company,
there
is
no
question
is
required
to
bargain
with
the
union,
respecting
their
wages,
hours
and
other
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
now
this
obligation
includes
the
employment
conditions
of
persons
outside
the
unit
where
they
have
a
direct
impact
on
the
conditions
of
the
employees
within
the
union
unit,
and
therefore,
the
company
i
submit,
is
wholly
accurate
in
saying
that
the
bargaining
unit
finds
the
boundaries
of
the
bargaining
obligation
and
concludes
the
scope
of
the
bargain.
this
court's
decision
in
the
oliver
case,
we
submit,
establishes
the
proposition
--
the
contrary
proposition
because
in
oliver
as
the
court
will
recall,
it
held
that
a
bargaining
unit,
including
an
overwhelming
majority
of
concededly
employed
drivers
of
carry
your
own
equipment
was
entitled
under
section
8
(b)
of
the
national
labor
relation
act.
the
bargain
to
impasse
concerning
the
minimum
rentals
to
be
received
by
owner-drivers
when
they
became
leasees
of
the
carrier
and
as
the
court
explained
in
the
drum
case,
it
is
holding
in
oliver,
said
“it
was
not
necessary
to
determine
whether
the
owner-drivers
were
employees
protected
by
the
act
since
the
establishment
of
the
minimal
rental
to
them
was
integral
to
the
establishment
of
a
stable
wage
structure
were
clearly
covered
employee
drivers.
now
we
submit
here
that
so
here
the
benefits
paid
to
retirees
are
integral
to
the
establishment
of
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
are
clearly
covered
active
employees.
and
if
we
are
right
on
this
point,
we
think
that
that
is
enough
to
sustain
the
board's
as
position
without
more.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
now
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
we
submit,
no
your
honor
for
this
reason.
there
is
a
very
close
relationship
here
between
the
benefits
paid
to
the
actives
and
adjustments
in
retiree
benefits.
it
is
true
that
it
does
not
involve
a
loss
of
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
loss
of
jobs
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
when
we
say
immediate
threat
to
wages
i
think
that
is
where
we
would
differ
with
the
company
here
because
the
adjustments
that
are
made
in
the
benefits
for
retired
employees
directly
affect
the
bargain
that
is
going
to
be
made
for
the
active
employees.
if
the
adjustments
made
for
retirees
are
too
liberal,
as
obviously
it
is
going
to
be
less
in
the
path
where
the
active
employees
because
the
employers
generally
allocate
a
certain
amount
for
their
total
labor
cost
fixed
beyond
that.
the
active
employee
being
aware
of
these
unanticipated
changes
is
going
to
look
to
what
the
retiree
is
getting.
if
there
is
a
history
in
this
plan
of
negotiation
to
improve
the
retirement
benefits,
the
active
employees
will
might
well
be
willing
to
settle
for
a
fixed
retirement
plan
and
a
mandatory
retirement
age,
living
the
negotiations,
the
ironing
out
of
the
unanticipated
events
develop
in
the
future.
if
there
is
not
this
history
of
bargaining
or
this
possibility
of
bargaining,
the
chances
are
that
the
active
employees
are
going
to
insist
upon
some
kind
of
a
flexible
retirement
plan
where
the
cost
of
living
escalates
across.
this
is
going
to
make
it
much
harder
to
get
a
bargain
for
the
active
employees
so
that
there
is
a
very
close
relationship
here
between
the
bargaining
for
the
active
employees
and
the
adjustment
in
retiree
benefits.
i
should
like
to
save
the
balance
of
my
time
for
the
rebuttal
and
leave
the
briefs
secondly
to
the
my
arguments.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
your
honor,
i
think
might
as
well
start
with
that
precise
holding
of
the
board
in
this
case
that
at
pages
46
and
47
of
the
appendix
and
the
board
reading
down
toward
the
middle
there
says
“accordingly
we
find
that
by
unilaterally
modifying
its
medical
insurance
plan
for
retired
employees
respondent
violated
section
8
(a)
(5)
and
one
of
the
act.
mr.
norton
j.
come
46,
the
last
sentence
of
the
first
paragraph
accordingly
and
then
at
the
bottom
of
the
next
paragraph
the
board
says
we
hold
only
on
the
record
this
case
that
the
respondent
violated
statute
by
making
unilateral
changes
and
then
finding
three
on
page
47
by
instituting
unilateral
adjustments
in
the
health
insurance
plan
for
its
retired
employees.
now
i
think
that
is
the
factual
setting
of
this
case
and
a
precise
holding
of
the
board.
i
think
however
that
candor
requires
me
to
point
out
that
although
that
is
not
this
case
that
the
logic
of
upholding
that
this
is
a
mandatory
subject
of
bargaining
would
mean
that
in
a
case
where
you
did
not
have
employer
making
a
unilateral
adjustment,
but
the
union
proposes
a
change
in
the
retiree
benefits.
there
would
be
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
assuming
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
is
the
logic
of
the
board's
holding
here.
i
do
not
think
that
is
what
it
held
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
all
that
i
say
however
pre
supposes
that
under
the
contract
will
not
preclude
a
reopening.
i
mean,
obviously
if
there
is
a
contract
in
an
effect
that
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
what
does
means
is,
your
honor
is
that
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
facts,
the
contract
here
had
two
years
i
believe
to
go.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
now
under
8
(b)
neither
party
is
obliged
to
discuss
reopening
of
the
terms
fixed,
however,
since
the
company
agreed
to
reconsider
the
effects
of
medicare,
the
matter,
it
did
not
effect
waived
its
right
to
say
no
we
are
not
going
to
talk
about
this
while
the
contract
is
still
on
effect
and
at
that
point
it
became
a
bargainable
matter.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
and
of
course
the
way
the.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
but
of
course
the
way
that
the
problem
is
most
likely
to
arise
is
judged
by
the
experience
in
the
area
is
going
to
be
in
the
context
of
your
having
negotiated
a
health
and
welfare
or
pension
plan
that
is
going
to
cover
active
employees
and
retirees.
and
then
as
a
result
of
unforeseen
changes
either
the
employer
or
the
union
is
going
to
bring
up
the
question
whether
it'd
be
at
the
time
that
you
negotiate
a
new
contract
or
whether
in
the
course
of
an
old
one
that
can
be
reopened,
the
question
of
adjusting
to
these
unexpected,
unforeseen
changes
and
the
questions
and
these
adjustments
are
made
today
so
that
the
question
is
should
the
employer
although
up
to
now
as
our
data
shows,
he
has
been
willing
to
bargain
about
it,
should
he
be
permitted
to
say
that
from
here
on
i
am
going
to
do
it
unilaterally,
that
is
what
this
case
boils
down
to.
now
we
are
not
seeking
to
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
but
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
him
however
from
improving
those
adjustments
and
those
provisions
and
the
question
is,
is
it
healthier
for
collective
bargaining
relationship
plus
the
impact,
including
the
impact
on
the
active
employees
for
these
improvements
to
be
negotiated
as
a
result
of
the
same
kind
of
bilateral
negotiations
that
went
into
formulating
them
to
begin
with
or
to
permit
the
employer
to
make
these
changes
unilaterally.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
(inaudible)
your
honor
i
just
want
to
say
without
being
overly
argumentative
that
part
of
the
reason
in
that
governs
whether
you
conclude
that
a
subject
is
a
mandatory
subject
of
collective
bargaining
or
not
is
whether
or
not
it
is
likely
to
be
a
bone
of
contention
between
labor
and
management
and
that
it
makes
for
industrial
peace
rather
than
strike
subjective
to
the
collective
bargaining
processes
of
the
act
and
that
is
all
that
i
meant
by
health
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
in
the
board's
view
your
honor
as
i
understand
it,
it
could.
whether
it
would
or
not
of
course
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
the
same
argument
could
have
been
made
and
was
made
by
the
employers
in
1947
when
they
were
protesting
the
extension
of
the
ex-bargaining
requirements,
the
bargaining
over
pensions
and
health
and
welfare
benefits.
there
is
a
whole
history
of
what
is
a
mandatory
subject
of
bargaining
has
been
an
evolving
one.
and
things
that
today
are
routinely
accepted
as
bargainable
in
1935
or
even
in
1947
were
looked
at
as
being
unheard
of
extension,
but
the
concept
does
grow
and
we
submit
that
this
a
reasonable
extension
of
the
holding
in
inland
steel
in
1947
that
the
whole
matter
of
pensions
and
health
and
welfare
matters
are
part
of
matter.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
the
board
would
find
that,
that
is
a
violation
of
8
(d).
the.
mr.
norton
j.
come
8
(d)
says
that
you
cannot
make
a
modification.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
an
8
(a)
(5)
via
8
(d).
mr.
norton
j.
come
no
other
reason.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
and
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
believe
that
is
right
on
that
aspect
oft
the
issue,
thank
you.
