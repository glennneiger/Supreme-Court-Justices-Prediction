mr.

you
may
proceed.
chief

warren
e.

was
it
the
relationship
that
--
chief

warren
e.
burger
how
is
the
son
different
from
the
checkroom
that
mr.
justice
white
postulated?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
he
drove
out
the
country
with
the
truck
and
had
a
bulldozer,
and
bulldozed
a
great,
big
hole
on
the
ground,
buried
it
and
cover
it
over,
and
just
we
don’t
know
whose
land
it
is?
chief

burger
expectation
of
privacy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
amendment
honors
and
protects
that
kind
of
a
claim
of
privacy,
that
kind
of
an
expectation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
personal
right
to
bury
--
i’d
stolen
goods
on
somebody
else’s
land?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
course,
they
aren’t
his,
by
definition
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
--
so
that
you’d
have
standing
to
lose
the
issue,
to
lose
the
point?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
wouldn’t
you
--
aren’t
there
some
situations
in
which
prior
to
the
determination
of
the
ultimate
issue,
the
known
possession
of
stolen
property
affords
spaces
for
probable
cause
for
either
an
arrest
or
a
warrant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
you
sometimes
do
need
to
make
a
preliminary
and
tentative
determination
before
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
anymore
than
that
involved
here,
the
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he
wasn’t
entitled
to
the
possession
of
this,
probably?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
reynolds.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
as
i
understood
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
with
mr.
justice
white’s
question,
maybe
i
got
a
different
thrust
from
what
you
did.
i
understood
him
to
pose
to
you
a
case
where
the
owner
of
the
establishment
had
consented
to
the
entry
and
the
search,
and
then
an
officer
went
in
and
saw
the
shotguns,
hand
grenades,
machine
guns
on
their
face,
something
he
could
observe.
now,
is
that
the
way
you
understood
this
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
standing
to
complain
before
the
material
was
admitted
in
evidence.
but
would
there
be
any
question
about
its
admissibility?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
until
you’ve
determined
the
very
narrow
question
that
you
suggest
to
remand
on.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
perry,
do
you
have
anything
further
