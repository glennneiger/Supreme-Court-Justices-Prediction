mr.
james
n.
perry
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we’d
like
to
acknowledge
and
recognize
that
mr.
william
f.
hopkins
would
have
been
here
today,
but
on
advice
of
counsel,
he
was
unable
to
travel
to
washington.
the
petitioner
was
charged
with
an
indictment
having
to
do
with
receiving,
possessing,
and
concealing
goods
that
were
stolen
in
interstate
commerce.
when
the
matter
came
on
for
trial,
there
was
a
pretrial
motion
to
suppress.
the
argument
was
basically
that
the
affidavit
in
the
search
warrant
was
defective.
without
the
issue
of
standing
having
been
challenged,
the
court
overruled
the
pretrial
motion
to
suppress,
the
matter
went
to
trial,
petitioner
was
found
guilty.
when
the
matter
was
appealed
to
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
time,
the
united
states
government
raised
the
issue
of
standing.
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
determined
that
we
did
not
have
standing
and
they
affirmed
the
trial
court.
now,
the
argument
of
the
petitioner
is
relatively
straight
forward.
we
feel
there’s
a
tension
between
the
fourth
and
the
fifth
amendment.
we’re
relying
upon
jones
and
we’re
relying
upon
simmons,
and
we’re
saying
that
if
an
indictment
has
as
one
of
its
element’s
possession,
the
government
cannot
deny
to
a
standing
to
attack
a
search
warrant.
now
the
government
has
argued
that
actually
they
have
two
positions.
they’ve
argued
that
simmons
gives
the
petitioner
protection
because
whatever
he
says
at
the
pretrial
hearing
cannot
be
used
against
him
but
the
trial
in
chief.
and
they
also,
have
urged
the
court
to
adopt
the
theory
that
a
thief
can
have
no
expectation
of
privacy
with
regard
to
the
goods
that
he
stolen,
and
cannot
therefore
bring
himself
within
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
james
n.
perry
no,
your
honor.
i’d
say
they
had
permission
to
enter
the
checkroom
by
the
checkroom
girl.
mr.
james
n.
perry
yes
sir.
mr.
james
n.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
n.
perry
yes,
sir.
i
would
say
that
the
thief
at
least
has
standing
to
make
that
argument,
he
may
lose.
mr.
james
n.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
n.
perry
in
our
case,
the
goods
were
seized
on
a
farm
in
hazard,
kentucky
where
the
goods
were
stored
on
the
petitioner’s
father’s
farm.
mr.
james
n.
perry
no,
sir.
mr.
james
n.
perry
well,
we
feel
that
to
assert
that
–
yes,
this
liquor
did
belong
to
me.
that
i
did
have
possession
of
it,
forces
him
to
admit
an
element
of
the
crime
which
--
mr.
james
n.
perry
yes
sir.
mr.
james
n.
perry
oh!
it
would
appear
that
we
do
not
have
a
search,
your
honor.
if
they
saw
it,
did
they
look
for
it
on
the
farm?
mr.
james
n.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
n.
perry
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
there
are
no
violations
of
his
rights
at
that
point.
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
n.
perry
your
honor,
we
feel
that
in
this
particular
instance,
the
search
warrant
was
and
i
think
it’s
conceded,
it
was
not
an
adequate
warrant,
and
we
want
to
attack
that.
mr.
james
n.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
n.
perry
we
had
an
expectation
of
privacy
and
that’s
why
we
concealed
on
this
farm.
the
goods
were
hot,
were
trying
to
hide
it.
mr.
james
n.
perry
your
honor,
the
issue
of
standing
was
not
discussed
at
the
trial
court
level.
when
we
had
the
pretrial
motion
to
suppress,
it
was
never
raised.
in
other
words,
the
issue
was
never
discussed.
the
only
thing
that
was
discussed
was
the
sufficiency
of
the
affidavit.
mr.
james
n.
perry
i
believe
that’s
right.
yes,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
i’m
saying
that
we
feel
that
if
they
did
not
have
a
valid
warrant,
they
did
not
have
a
right
to
go
on
this
farm
and
find
the
liquor.
mr.
james
n.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
n.
perry
no,
your
honor.
our
point
of
view
would
be
that
we
are
entitled
to
suppress
that
evidence
even
though
the
liquor
that
we
had
stolen
was
secreted
on
the
farm
of
a
stranger.
mr.
james
n.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
n.
perry
yes
sir
because
in
this
instance,
he
hid
them,
he
doesn’t
want
anybody
to
find
them
illustrating
his
intent
to
conceal
them.
he’s
trying
to
hide
them,
he
does
expect
privacy
and
further
--
mr.
james
n.
perry
well,
we
understand
that
the
fourth
amendment
is
a
personal
right
and
the
--
mr.
james
n.
perry
well,
to
be
protected
in
your
effects
and
your
effects
are
the
liquor
that
you’ve
buried.
mr.
james
n.
perry
well,
in
the
--
from
the
concept
of
property
and
ownership,
the
court
is
correct.
but
the
man
did
have
possession
of
them
and
he’s
charged
with
possession
as
an
element
of
the
crime.
mr.
james
n.
perry
yes,
your
honor,
based
on
the
idea
that
we
were
charged
with
possession.
the
mere
fact
that
we’re
charged
with
possession
forces
us
to
give
up
something
in
order
to
protect
ourselves
so
that
we
can
have
this
evidence
suppressed.
mr.
james
n.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
n.
perry
your
honor,
maybe
if
i
had
the
opportunity,
i
take
that
back.
mr.
james
n.
perry
your
honor,
that
question
is
a
difficult
imposed
question.
i
would
say
that
they
had
an
access
to
the
courtroom
but
with
regard
to
the
goods
that
they
took,
if
they’re
charging
us
with
possession
of
them
as
an
element
of
our
crime,
then
i
think
that
gives
us
standing.
if
they
were
--
mr.
james
n.
perry
in
that
case,
i
would
say
probably
not.
mr.
james
n.
perry
yes,
sir.
now,
we
have
this
problem
that
when
we
had
a
motion
to
suppress,
and
we
are
asked
to
explain
how
we
acquire
our
rights
to
suppress
these
items.
whatever
we
say
may
be
used
against
this
is
of
the
trial
in
chief.
mr.
james
n.
perry
yes
sir,
that’s
correct.
now,
we’re
tying
to
determine
if
it
can
be
used
indirectly
from
the
standpoint
of
impeachment
as
harris
would
suggest
or
could
it
be
used
in
this
way.
let’s
suppose
that
we
were
successful
on
the
motion
to
suppress
and
the
tangible
evidence
could
not
be
used.
now,
could
the
united
states
government
use
other
facts
that
were
tainted
or
with
–
they
were
--
their
origin
was
the
basis
of
our
testimony
on
suppression
and
would
we
then
have
in
our
owned
type
of
question,
what
was
the
origin
of
these
facts
that
they’ve
presented?
was
it
truly
independent
or
was
it
from
our
testimony
at
the
pretrial?
now,
the
government
makes
the
point
that
if
the
man
is
a
thief,
with
regard
to
the
stolen
goods,
he
shouldn’t
have
standing.
but
in
order
to
determine
that
issue,
do
we
first
have
to
determine
that
he
is
a
thief,
which
is
really
what
is
supposed
to
be
determined
at
the
trial
in
chief.
we
would
say
that
he
is
entitled
to
assert
standing
without
having
any
determination
on
a
pretrial
basis
whether
he’s
a
thief
or
not.
mr.
james
n.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
n.
perry
yes
sir,
that’s
the
probable
cause
determination.
mr.
james
n.
perry
well,
except
to
that
at
the
pretrial
hearing,
he
might
come
on
and
say,
no,
i’m
not
a
thief.
and
then
you’re
going
to
have
an
issue
whether
there
was
probable
cause
that
he
was
thief
or
what
argue
was
not,
and
actually,
you’ve
got
an
issue
with
an
issue
determination.
mr.
james
n.
perry
your
honor,
the
tax
was
properly
paid,
it
was
legitimate
alcohol.
mr.
james
n.
perry
your
honor,
i
think
there
was
a
question
of
whether
it
was
stolen
and
who
stole
it.
as
i
understand
the
facts,
it
was
transported
in
interstate
commerce
from
ohio
to
kentucky.
it
was
properly
taxed
at
the
time
it
was
taken.
i
guess
basically,
what
we’re
saying,
the
court
has
shown
familiarity
with
our
position
certainly.
we’re
saying
the
united
states
government
should
not
be
allowed
to
benefit
from
lawlessness
that
is
if
they
can
go
out
and
breakdown
a
door
or
with
an
inadequate
warrant,
go
out
and
search
and
find
something.
they
should
not
through
the
limitation
of
simmons
or
through
the
suggestion
of
the
u.s.
attorney
be
permitted
to
use
that
evidence
against
us.
we
don’t
think
this
court
should
sanction
lawlessness
and
law
enforcement.
that’s
all
we
have
now.
mr.
james
n.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
n.
perry
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
james
n.
perry
we’d
argue
for
a
waiver
of
that
point
as
a
matter
of
fact,
while
the
u.s.
government,
we’re
not
raising
it
at
a
trial
court
level.
mr.
james
n.
perry
no,
sir.
mr.
james
n.
perry
well,
your
honor,
at
the
time
they
rested
on
the
arguments
at
pre
–
at
the
pretrial
motion
to
suppress,
they
did
not
know
if
it
was
going
to
be
favorable
or
not.
if
they
were
going
to,
if
they
were
concerned
about
it
you
would
think
that
it
ends
every
argument
that
they
had
and
not
reserve
one
for
an
after
the
fact,
use
as
it
were.
mr.
james
n.
perry
your
honor
as
a
matter
of
fact,
a
little
bit
more
on
that
point,
if
the
affidavit
in
the
search
warrant
had
been
adequate
under
aguilar
and
spinelli.
the
question
of
standing
probably
would
not
have
been
raised
because
that
affidavit
would’ve
been
included
the
basis
for
the
informant’s
information,
which
was
the
transportation
of
the
goods
by
the
petitioner
to
the
farm,
the
concealing
of
the
goods
on
the
farm.
mr.
james
n.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
n.
perry
yes,
sir.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
james
n.
perry
nothing
further,
your
honor.
mr.
james
n.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
n.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
n.
perry
your
honor,
i’m
unable
to
say
right
now.
i
don’t
know.
mr.
james
n.
perry
your
honor,
this
man
is
out.
he
is
on
an
appeal
bond.
mr.
james
n.

no,
sir.
mr.
james

perry
no,

give
up
something
in
order
to
protect
ourselves
so
that
we
can
have
this
evidence
suppressed.
mr.
james
n.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
n.
perry
your
honor,
maybe
if
i
had
the
opportunity,
i
take
that
back.
mr.
james
n.
perry
your
honor,
that
question
is
a
difficult
imposed
question.
i
would
say
that
they
had
an
access
to
the
courtroom
but
with
regard
to
the
goods
that
they
took,
if
they’re
charging
us
with
possession
of
them
as
an
element
of
our
crime,
then
i
think
that
gives
us
standing.
if
they
were
--
mr.
james
n.
perry
in
that
case,
i
would
say
probably
not.
mr.
james
n.
perry
yes,
sir.
now,
we
have
this
problem
that
when
we
had
a
motion
to
suppress,
and
we
are
asked
to
explain
how
we
acquire
our
rights
to
suppress
these
items.
whatever
we
say
may
be
used
against
this
is
of
the
trial
in
chief.
mr.
james
n.
perry
yes
sir,
that’s
correct.
now,
we’re
tying
to
determine
if
it
can
be
used
indirectly
from
the
standpoint
of
impeachment
as
harris
would
suggest
or
could
it
be
used
in
this
way.
let’s
suppose
that
we
were
successful
on
the
motion
to
suppress
and
the
tangible
evidence
could
not
be
used.
now,
could
the
united
states
government
use
other
facts
that
were
tainted
or
with
–
they
were
--
their
origin
was
the
basis
of
our
testimony
on
suppression
and
would
we
then
have
in
our
owned
type
of
question,
what
was
the
origin
of
these
facts
that
they’ve
presented?
was
it
truly
independent
or
was
it
from
our
testimony
at
the
pretrial?
now,
the
government
makes
the
point
that
if
the
man
is
a
thief,
with
regard
to
the
stolen
goods,
he
shouldn’t
have
standing.
but
in
order
to
determine
that
issue,
do
we
first
have
to
determine
that
he
is
a
thief,
which
is
really
what
is
supposed
to
be
determined
at
the
trial
in
chief.
we
would
say
that
he
is
entitled
to
assert
standing
without
having
any
determination
on
a
pretrial
basis
whether
he’s
a
thief
or
not.
mr.
james
n.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
n.
perry
yes
sir,
that’s
the
probable
cause
determination.
mr.
james
n.
perry
well,
except
to
that
at
the
pretrial
hearing,
he
might
come
on
and
say,
no,
i’m
not
a
thief.
and
then
you’re
going
to
have
an
issue
whether
there
was
probable
cause
that
he
was
thief
or
what
argue
was
not,
and
actually,
you’ve
got
an
issue
with
an
issue
determination.
mr.
james
n.
perry
your
honor,
the
tax
was
properly
paid,
it
was
legitimate
alcohol.
mr.
james
n.
perry
your
honor,
i
think
there
was
a
question
of
whether
it
was
stolen
and
who
stole
it.
as
i
understand
the
facts,
it
was
transported
in
interstate
commerce
from
ohio
to
kentucky.
it
was
properly
taxed
at
the
time
it
was
taken.
i
guess
basically,
what
we’re
saying,
the
court
has
shown
familiarity
with
our
position
certainly.
we’re
saying
the
united
states
government
should
not
be
allowed
to
benefit
from
lawlessness
that
is
if
they
can
go
out
and
breakdown
a
door
or
with
an
inadequate
warrant,
go
out
and
search
and
find
something.
they
should
not
through
the
limitation
of
simmons
or
through
the
suggestion
of
the
u.s.
attorney
be
permitted
to
use
that
evidence
against
us.
we
don’t
think
this
court
should
sanction
lawlessness
and
law
enforcement.
that’s
all
we
have
now.
mr.
james
n.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
n.
perry
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
james
n.
perry
we’d
argue
for
a
waiver
of
that
point
as
a
matter
of
fact,
while
the
u.s.
government,
we’re
not
raising
it
at
a
trial
court
level.
mr.
james
n.
perry
no,
sir.
mr.
james
n.
perry
well,
your
honor,
at
the
time
they
rested
on
the
arguments
at
pre
–
at
the
pretrial
motion
to
suppress,
they
did
not
know
if
it
was
going
to
be
favorable
or
not.
if
they
were
going
to,
if
they
were
concerned
about
it
you
would
think
that
it
ends
every
argument
that
they
had
and
not
reserve
one
for
an
after
the
fact,
use
as
it
were.
mr.
james
n.
perry
your
honor
as
a
matter
of
fact,
a
little
bit
more
on
that
point,
if
the
affidavit
in
the
search
warrant
had
been
adequate
under
aguilar
and
spinelli.
the
question
of
standing
probably
would
not
have
been
raised
because
that
affidavit
would’ve
been
included
the
basis
for
the
informant’s
information,
which
was
the
transportation
of
the
goods
by
the
petitioner
to
the
farm,
the
concealing
of
the
goods
on
the
farm.
mr.
james
n.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
n.
perry
yes,
sir.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
james
n.
perry
nothing
further,
your
honor.
mr.
james
n.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
n.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
n.
perry
your
honor,
i’m
unable
to
say
right
now.
i
don’t
know.
mr.
james
n.
perry
your
honor,
this
man
is
out.
he
is
on
an
appeal
bond.
mr.
james
n.
perry
no,
sir.
mr.
james
n.
perry
no,
sir.
