justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
suppose
you
had
a
case
where
a
man
who
was
charged
with
stealing
it
and
transporting
it
in
interstate
commerce.
he
had
no
reason
to
be
sure
that
he
had
it
in
his
possession
at
the
time.
does
that
make
any
difference?
i
take
it
your
position
is
the
possession
itself
even
constructive,
that
it
makes
no
difference?
