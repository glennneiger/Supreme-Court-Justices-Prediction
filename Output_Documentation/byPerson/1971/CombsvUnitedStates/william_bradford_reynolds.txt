mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
the
single
issue
whether
one
charged
with
possession
of
stolen
property
should
by
virtue
of
that
charged
alone
be
accorded
automatic
standing
to
challenge
a
search
for
or
seizure
of
that
property,
and
in
order
to
put
that
issue
in
proper
context,
let
me
amplify
on
the
facts
provided
by
mr.
perry
just
briefly.
prior
to
trial
in
this
case,
petitioner
moved
to
suppress
the
26
cases
of
whiskey
involved
here
that
were
seized
by
the
kentucky
state
police,
claming
that
the
underlying
affidavit
for
the
search
warrant
was
legally
deficient.
the
motion
was
heard
by
the
district
court
and
denied
and
at
that
time
the
question
of
standing
was
not
raised
or
argued
by
the
parties.
the
case
then
proceeded
to
trial
where
the
government’s
evidence
reveals
the
following.
on
july
28,
1969,
petitioner
telephoned
one
janet
ballard
and
asked
whether
she
knew
of
anyone
who
wanted
to
buy
some
whiskey.
she
said,
yes.
and
later
that
day,
petitioner
delivered
approximately
40
cases
of
whiskey
to
her
home
in
newport,
kentucky.
the
following
evening,
mrs.
ballard
called
petitioner,
told
him
that
she
had
heard
the
whiskey
was
stolen
and
asked
the
he
removed
it.
he
did
so
with
the
help
of
one
james
martin,
mrs.
ballard’s
brother,
and
they
stored
the
whiskey
in
a
basement
of
the
home
of
petitioner’s
estranged
wife,
which
at
that
time
also
contained
some
30
or
40
additional
cases
of
whiskey.
later
that
same
week,
martin
received
the
--
a
telephone
call
from
petitioner.
he
was
told
that
“the
heat
was
on”
and
that
the
whiskey
had
to
be
moved.
the
two
men
then
went
to
the
house,
loaded
all
the
cases
of
whiskey
onto
a
pick-up
truck
and
transported
the
whiskey
some
200
miles
to
hazard,
kentucky.
the
cases
were
stored
in
an
old
shed
on
the
farm
of
petitioner’s
father.
thereafter,
martin
went
to
the
fbi
agents
assigned
to
the
area
and
told
him
of
the
stolen
whiskey.
the
agent
gave
the
information
to
the
kentucky
state
police
and
they
obtained
and
executed
a
warrant
to
search
the
father’s
farm.
pursuant
thereto,
the
police
seized
in
the
shed
the
26
cases
of
whiskey
involved
here.
petitioner
who
is
now
present
at
the
time
was
later
arrested
in
his
home
in
newport,
kentucky.
his
defense
at
trial
was
based
on
testimony
given
by
petitioner
and
members
of
his
family
to
the
effect
that
the
shed
had
earlier
been
rented
by
james
martin
and
one
charles
chapman.
that
it
was
martin
and
chapman
who
had
stored
the
whiskey
in
the
shed
and
the
petitioner
had
not
been
on
or
near
his
father’s
farm
during
the
relevant
period
and
had
never
anything
to
do
with
the
whiskey
in
question.
following
his
conviction,
petitioner
appealed
to
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
on
the
ground
that
the
whiskey
had
been
seized
under
an
invalid
search
warrant
and
that
the
evidence
had
therefore
been
improperly
admitted.
the
government,
recognizing
for
the
first
on
appeal
that
the
underlying
affidavit
for
the
search
warrant
was
legally
deficient
under
aguilar
v.
texas
argued
only
in
the
court
of
appeals
the
petitioner
lacks
standing
to
raise
the
fourth
amendment
claim.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
the
argument
there
was
based
on
the
fact
that
petitioner
had
no
interest
in
the
premises
searched
or
in
the
property
seized,
and
he
was
not
on
the
premises
nor--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
believe
that
that’s
the
issue
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
your
honor
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
he
had
no
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well
then,
i
believe
that
there
isn’t
--
there
--
the
issue
was
whether
he
could
assert
an
interest
in
the
personal
property
that
was
seized.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
our
position
is
that
he
should
not
be
able
to
assert
an
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
seized
property
because
it
was
stolen
property,
but
that
our
position
that
the
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well
your
honor,
i
believe
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
believe
that
there
may
be
some
question
under
a
prior
decision
of
this
court,
jeffers
v.
united
states,
where
there
was
language
to
the
effect
that
contraband
property
and
we
don’t
perceive
any
basis
for
distinction
between
contraband
and
stolen
property
in
this
respect
--
contraband
per
se.
there
was
language
which
indicated
that
one
might
have
a
proprietary
interest
in
contraband,
sufficient
to
give
him
a
right
of
privacy
in
the
property
seized.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
no,
i
think
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
that’s
correct
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
that’s
the
position
we
take
and
we
believe
that
they
can
do
that.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
is
correct
your
honor
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
to
object
to
that.
but
i
understood.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
believe
that’s
correct.
we
will
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
right.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
we
--
yes.
well,
the
question
of
the
suppression
is
over
if
he
has
no
interest
in
the
premises.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
then
he
would
not
have
any
standing
to
raise
a
fourth
amendment
claim.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
to
the
extent
that
--
well,
our
position
is
that
if
they
are
not
his
effects,
he
has
no
right
to
assert
a
fourth
amendment
claim
as
to
effects
that
are
stolen.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
our
position
would
be
the
same
with
respect
to
heroin.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
in
this
case,
we’re
talking
about
stolen
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
alright,
i
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
the
evidence
unquestionably
belongs
to
the
sense
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
that
the
defendant
would
then
have
a
right
of
privacy
in
the
effect
that
unquestionably
belonged
to
him
which
would
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
--
the
question,
i
believe
is
whether
he
would
have
standing
to
object
to
the
seizure,
i
believe
we
could
seize.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
turns
on
whether
it
was
a
reasonable
or
unreasonable
seizure
and
i
believe
that
draws
into
question
whether
it
was
plain
view
or
whether
it’s
in
the
permissible
scope
of
the
search
at
the
time,
and
questions
of
that
nature.
but
as
to
standing,
our
position
would
be
that
he
would
have
standing
to
object
to
the
seizure
because
it
was
an
effect
that
did
belong
to
him.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
resolution
to
that
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
believe
that
on
those
facts
that
he
would
have
standing.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
oh!
i
--
no,
i
think
that
the
admissibility,
it
would
clearly
--
he
would
not
be
in
a
position
to
suppress
the
evidence.
but
i
believe
that
that’s
a
different
question
as
to
whether
--
then
the
question
whether
he
has
standing.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
think
there
is
an
overlap
and
it’s
interrelated
but
i
believe
that
there
--
it
could
be
that
a
person
has
standing
to
object
to
a
seizure
of
what
is
lawfully
his
personal
effects,
and
yet,
because
the
seizure
is
reasonable,
not
be
able
to
suppress
that.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
our
position,
yes.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
that’s
our
position.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
we
do.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
somebody’s
fourth
amendment
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy,
yes.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
now,
the
problem
that
the
--
the
reason
we
have
such
a
problem
with
respect
to
standing
is
because
of
the
decision
of
this
court
in
jones
v.
united
states
where
it
was
held
that
one
who
is
charged
with
a
possessory
crime,
in
this
case
possession
of
stolen
property
automatically
has
standing
to
contest
or
challenge
the
search
and
seizure.
and
we
believe
that
the
dual
rational
of
the
jones
decision
has
been
undermined
significantly
by
the
subsequent
decision
in
this
court
in
simmons.
and
that
it
should
be
reexamined
by
this
court
and
to
the
extent
that
it
would
confer
automatic
standing
in
one
charged
with
a
possessory
crime
of
stolen
property
it
should
be
abandoned.
the
reason
given,
one
of
the
reasons
given
by
the
court
to
sustain
the
automatic
standing
rule,
it’s
--
was
essentially
that
the
defendant
in
order
to
establish
standing
to
suppress
evidence
might
well
have
virtually
to
admit
his
guilt
of
the
possessory
offense
charged.
and
his
virtual
admission
could
then
at
that
time,
be
used
against
him
at
the
trial.
in
this
prospect
or
dilemma
as
it
were
referred
to
in
jones
was
viewed
by
the
court
as
a
deterrent
on
some
defendants
who
would
otherwise
have
come
forward
to
vindicate
their
fourth
amendment
claims.
and
was
thus
considered,
the
court
said
to
weaken
the
efficacy
of
the
exclusionary
rule
as
a
sanction
from
unlawful
police
behavior.
no
longer,
however
does
there
seem
to
be
a
real
prospect
of
later
direct
use
at
trial
of
testimony
given
earlier
in
support
of
a
suppression
motion.
in
simmons
v.
united
states
at
390
u.s.
decided
several
years
after
jones,
this
court
held
the
testimony
given
by
a
defendant
in
support
of
his
motion
to
suppress
under
the
fourth
amendment
may
not
thereafter
be
admitted
against
him
at
trial
on
the
issue
of
guilt
unless
he
makes
no
objection
and
this
use
restriction
rule
of
simmons
essentially
removes
the
dilemma
that
was
confronting
defendants
at
the
time
that
jones
was
deciding
and
then
thereby
eliminates
one
of
the
two
reasons
given
by
the
court
in
jones
for
fashioning
an
automatic
standing
rule.
as
to
the
other
reason
which
was
that
the
government
would
have
the
benefit
of
the
--
the
rule
of
the
automatic
standing
rule
was
fashioned
so
the
government
would
not
have
the
benefit
of
contradictory
positions
as
a
basis
for
conviction.
that’s
also
undermined
by
simmons
cause
that
rational
was
based
on
the
argument
that
if
a
defendant
was
sufficiently
deterred
from
asserting
his
fourth
amendment
right,
so
that
he
remain
silent,
choosing
not
to
acknowledge
any
interest
in
the
premises
search
to
the
property
seized.
but
the
government
would
then
have
the
advantage
of
a
position
on
a
question
of
the
admissibility
of
evidence
that
was
seemingly
inconsistent
with
its
proof
of
lawful
possession
at
trial.
however,
now
that
the
fact
that
it
was
deterred,
defendants
from
moving
to
suppress
has
been
removed
by
simmons,
the
used
restriction
rule
of
simmons.
it
seems
unlikely
that
defendants
will
choose
to
forego
pressing
their
fourth
amendment
claims.
perhaps
even
more
to
the
point,
if
one
is
charged
--
who
is
charged
with
possession
moves
to
suppress
on
grounds
of
illegal
search
or
seizure,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
government
is
required
as
we
understand
the
fundamental
inquiry
for
purposes
of
standing
under
the
fourth
amendment
to
maintain
a
position
inconsistent
with
or
contradictory
to
its
position
at
trial.
in
this
case,
petitioner’s
conviction
flows
from
proof
of
his
knowing
possession
of
the
stolen
whiskey
before
and
at
the
time
of
the
search.
if
the
admissibility
into
evidence
of
the
fruits
of
that
search,
on
the
ground
the
petitioner
lacks
standing
is
perfectly
consistent
we
think,
but
the
theory
that
petitioner
have
constructed
possession
of
the
whiskey
at
all
relevant
times.
his
standing
depends
upon
some
showing
of
an
intrusion
of
privacy
of
his
own
person,
his
own
house,
his
own
papers
or
his
own
effects,
or
an
intrusion
on
premises
in
which
he
personally
had
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy.
in
the
absence
of
such
a
showing,
the
evidence
is
admissible
without
regard
to
whether
petitioner
might
claim
which
he
never
has
done
in
this
case
that
he
possessed
the
stolen
whiskey.
it
would
thus
be
no
need
for
the
government
to
dispute
such
a
claim
on
a
motion
to
suppress.
in
sum,
we
do
not
believe
that
he
had
the
fundamental
purpose
of
the
fourth
amendment
to
protect
individual
privacy,
or
the
dual
rational
of
jones
v.
united
states
when
read
in
light
of
this
court’s
subsequent
decision
in
simmons.
warrants
and
application
of
auto
--
of
the
automatic
standing
rule
to
one
charge
with
lawless
possession
on
the
sole
basis
for
its
fourth
amendment
claim
is
the
seizure
of
stolen
property
in
which
he
has
no
legitimate
proprietary
interest
and
with
respect
to
which
he
can
have
no
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
your
honor,
i
don’t
believe
i
have
an
answer
as
to
why
they
did
not
raise
a
standing
point.
the
government
failed
to
raise
it.
it
raised
it
for
the
first
time
in
the
court
of
appeals.
no
objection
was
made
by
petitioner
at
that
time.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
it
was
argued
in
the
briefs
and
it
was
argued
on
petition
for
rehearing.
the
court
of
appeals
decided
the
question
on
the
standing
issue
alone
and
at
no
time
in
the
court
of
appeals
was
an
objection
made
to
the
fact
that
the
standing
issue
had
not
been
raised
in
the
district
court.
when
the
court
came
here
--
when
the
case
came
here
on
petition
for
certiorari,
there
was
no
objection
to
that
--
to
the
fact
that
it
had
not
been
raised
below.
the
petition
was
addressed
itself
solely
to
the
point
that
we’re
discussing
here
going
to
the
standing.
in
the
merits
brief,
there
was
also
no
objection
raised
on
that
point,
on
petitioner’s
merits
brief.
again,
addressing
himself
solely
to
the
standing
question.
now
in
jones,
v.
united
states,
the
same
one
we’ve
been
discussing
at
362,
this
court
had
a
similar
situation
before
it
and
said
that
the
question
was
properly
before
it
in
the
circumstances
and
if
they
could
decide
the
issue.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
was
going
to
–
i
was
about
to
mention,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
correct,
i
believe
that
the
case,
if
we
or
we
prevail,
we
believe
the
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
an
opportunity
to
determine
the
interest
whether
it
was
a
sufficient
interest
in
the
premises
search.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
believe
that’s
correct
your
honor.
the
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
and
he
is
the
petitioner.
if
our
argument
is
accepted
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
believe
that
if
the
case
is
remanded
for
the
purposes
of
a
hearing,
it
would
have
to
reversed
and
vacated.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
the
fact
finder
has
never
yet
heard
the
stand.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
the
father
was
convicted
and
did
not
have
the
appropriate
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
the
brother
was
not
convicted.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
in
the
same
time
trial,
your
honor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
no,
there
was
no
conspiracy
alleged.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
it
was
a
joint
trial,
there
was
no
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
believe
there
could
be
a
remand
before
the
--
to
hear
on
the
evidence
on
the
suppression
hearing
without
--
before
doing
that
--
vacating
the
judgment.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
yes,
your
honor,
that
would
be
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
no!
no,
just
the
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
the
court
of
appeals
judgment.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
the
court
of
appeals
but
–
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
we
think
that
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
could
remain
in
effect
until
such
time
as
you
had
the
hearing.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
on
the
suppression.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
right.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
yes,
perhaps
vacation
might
have
been
a
better
choice
of
word.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well
he
is
--
in
this
case
the
defendant
was
charged
with
receiving,
possessing
and
concealing
tax
paid
whiskey
that
have
been
stolen
from
an
interstate
shipment
knowing
it
to
be
stolen.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
correct
your
honor.
we
don’t
believe
that
the
element
of
possession
should
have
a
bearing
on
the
question
of
the
fourth
amendment
question.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
with
respect
to
stolen
goods.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
at
the
trial.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
yes
it
is,
it
is
an
element
of
the
offense
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
under
this
indictment.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
to
be
guilty
under
this
indictment.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
correct.
is
that,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
the
single
issue
whether
one
charged
with
possession
of
stolen
property
should
by
virtue
of
that
charged
alone
be
accorded
automatic
standing
to
challenge
a
search
for
or
seizure
of
that
property,
and
in
order
to
put
that
issue
in
proper
context,
let
me
amplify
on
the
facts
provided
by
mr.
perry
just
briefly.
prior
to
trial
in
this
case,
petitioner
moved
to
suppress
the
26
cases
of
whiskey
involved
here
that
were
seized
by
the
kentucky
state
police,
claming
that
the
underlying
affidavit
for
the
search
warrant
was
legally
deficient.
the
motion
was
heard
by
the
district
court
and
denied
and
at
that
time
the
question
of
standing
was
not
raised
or
argued
by
the
parties.
the
case
then
proceeded
to
trial
where
the
government’s
evidence
reveals
the
following.
on
july
28,
1969,
petitioner
telephoned
one
janet
ballard
and
asked
whether
she
knew
of
anyone
who
wanted
to
buy
some
whiskey.
she
said,
yes.
and
later
that
day,
petitioner
delivered
approximately
40
cases
of
whiskey
to
her
home
in
newport,
kentucky.
the
following
evening,
mrs.
ballard
called
petitioner,
told
him
that
she
had
heard
the
whiskey
was
stolen
and
asked
the
he
removed
it.
he
did
so
with
the
help
of
one
james
martin,
mrs.
ballard’s
brother,
and
they
stored
the
whiskey
in
a
basement
of
the
home
of
petitioner’s
estranged
wife,
which
at
that
time
also
contained
some
30
or
40
additional
cases
of
whiskey.
later
that
same
week,
martin
received
the
--
a
telephone
call
from
petitioner.
he
was
told
that
“the
heat
was
on”
and
that
the
whiskey
had
to
be
moved.
the
two
men
then
went
to
the
house,
loaded
all
the
cases
of
whiskey
onto
a
pick-up
truck
and
transported
the
whiskey
some
200
miles
to
hazard,
kentucky.
the
cases
were
stored
in
an
old
shed
on
the
farm
of
petitioner’s
father.
thereafter,
martin
went
to
the
fbi
agents
assigned
to
the
area
and
told
him
of
the
stolen
whiskey.
the
agent
gave
the
information
to
the
kentucky
state
police
and
they
obtained
and
executed
a
warrant
to
search
the
father’s
farm.
pursuant
thereto,
the
police
seized
in
the
shed
the
26
cases
of
whiskey
involved
here.
petitioner
who
is
now
present
at
the
time
was
later
arrested
in
his
home
in
newport,
kentucky.
his
defense
at
trial
was
based
on
testimony
given
by
petitioner
and
members
of
his
family
to
the
effect
that
the
shed
had
earlier
been
rented
by
james
martin
and
one
charles
chapman.
that
it
was
martin
and
chapman
who
had
stored
the
whiskey
in
the
shed
and
the
petitioner
had
not
been
on
or
near
his
father’s
farm
during
the
relevant
period
and
had
never
anything
to
do
with
the
whiskey
in
question.
following
his
conviction,
petitioner
appealed
to
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
on
the
ground
that
the
whiskey
had
been
seized
under
an
invalid
search
warrant
and
that
the
evidence
had
therefore
been
improperly
admitted.
the
government,
recognizing
for
the
first
on
appeal
that
the
underlying
affidavit
for
the
search
warrant
was
legally
deficient
under
aguilar
v.
texas
argued
only
in
the
court
of
appeals
the
petitioner
lacks
standing
to
raise
the
fourth
amendment
claim.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
the
argument
there
was
based
on
the
fact
that
petitioner
had
no
interest
in
the
premises
searched
or
in
the
property
seized,
and
he
was
not
on
the
premises
nor--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
believe
that
that’s
the
issue
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
your
honor
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
he
had
no
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well
then,
i
believe
that
there
isn’t
--
there
--
the
issue
was
whether
he
could
assert
an
interest
in
the
personal
property
that
was
seized.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
our
position
is
that
he
should
not
be
able
to
assert
an
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
seized
property
because
it
was
stolen
property,
but
that
our
position
that
the
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well
your
honor,
i
believe
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
believe
that
there
may
be
some
question
under
a
prior
decision
of
this
court,
jeffers
v.
united
states,
where
there
was
language
to
the
effect
that
contraband
property
and
we
don’t
perceive
any
basis
for
distinction
between
contraband
and
stolen
property
in
this
respect
--
contraband
per
se.
there
was
language
which
indicated
that
one
might
have
a
proprietary
interest
in
contraband,
sufficient
to
give
him
a
right
of
privacy
in
the
property
seized.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
no,
i
think
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
that’s
correct
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
that’s
the
position
we
take
and
we
believe
that
they
can
do
that.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
is
correct
your
honor
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
to
object
to
that.
but
i
understood.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
believe
that’s
correct.
we
will
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
right.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
we
--
yes.
well,
the
question
of
the
suppression
is
over
if
he
has
no
interest
in
the
premises.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
then
he
would
not
have
any
standing
to
raise
a
fourth
amendment
claim.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
to
the
extent
that
--
well,
our
position
is
that
if
they
are
not
his
effects,
he
has
no
right
to
assert
a
fourth
amendment
claim
as
to
effects
that
are
stolen.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
our
position
would
be
the
same
with
respect
to
heroin.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
in
this
case,
we’re
talking
about
stolen
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
alright,
i
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
the
evidence
unquestionably
belongs
to
the
sense
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
that
the
defendant
would
then
have
a
right
of
privacy
in
the
effect
that
unquestionably
belonged
to
him
which
would
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
--
the
question,
i
believe
is
whether
he
would
have
standing
to
object
to
the
seizure,
i
believe
we
could
seize.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
turns
on
whether
it
was
a
reasonable
or
unreasonable
seizure
and
i
believe
that
draws
into
question
whether
it
was
plain
view
or
whether
it’s
in
the
permissible
scope
of
the
search
at
the
time,
and
questions
of
that
nature.
but
as
to
standing,
our
position
would
be
that
he
would
have
standing
to
object
to
the
seizure
because
it
was
an
effect
that
did
belong
to
him.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
resolution
to
that
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
believe
that
on
those
facts
that
he
would
have
standing.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
oh!
i
--
no,
i
think
that
the
admissibility,
it
would
clearly
--
he
would
not
be
in
a
position
to
suppress
the
evidence.
but
i
believe
that
that’s
a
different
question
as
to
whether
--
then
the
question
whether
he
has
standing.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
think
there
is
an
overlap
and
it’s
interrelated
but
i
believe
that
there
--
it
could
be
that
a
person
has
standing
to
object
to
a
seizure
of
what
is
lawfully
his
personal
effects,
and
yet,
because
the
seizure
is
reasonable,
not
be
able
to
suppress
that.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
our
position,
yes.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
that’s
our
position.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
we
do.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
somebody’s
fourth
amendment
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy,
yes.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
now,
the
problem
that
the
--
the
reason
we
have
such
a
problem
with
respect
to
standing
is
because
of
the
decision
of
this
court
in
jones
v.
united
states
where
it
was
held
that
one
who
is
charged
with
a
possessory
crime,
in
this
case
possession
of
stolen
property
automatically
has
standing
to
contest
or
challenge
the
search
and
seizure.
and
we
believe
that
the
dual
rational
of
the
jones
decision
has
been
undermined
significantly
by
the
subsequent
decision
in
this
court
in
simmons.
and
that
it
should
be
reexamined
by
this
court
and
to
the
extent
that
it
would
confer
automatic
standing
in
one
charged
with
a
possessory
crime
of
stolen
property
it
should
be
abandoned.
the
reason
given,
one
of
the
reasons
given
by
the
court
to
sustain
the
automatic
standing
rule,
it’s
--
was
essentially
that
the
defendant
in
order
to
establish
standing
to
suppress
evidence
might
well
have
virtually
to
admit
his
guilt
of
the
possessory
offense
charged.
and
his
virtual
admission
could
then
at
that
time,
be
used
against
him
at
the
trial.
in
this
prospect
or
dilemma
as
it
were
referred
to
in
jones
was
viewed
by
the
court
as
a
deterrent
on
some
defendants
who
would
otherwise
have
come
forward
to
vindicate
their
fourth
amendment
claims.
and
was
thus
considered,
the
court
said
to
weaken
the
efficacy
of
the
exclusionary
rule
as
a
sanction
from
unlawful
police
behavior.
no
longer,
however
does
there
seem
to
be
a
real
prospect
of
later
direct
use
at
trial
of
testimony
given
earlier
in
support
of
a
suppression
motion.
in
simmons
v.
united
states
at
390
u.s.
decided
several
years
after
jones,
this
court
held
the
testimony
given
by
a
defendant
in
support
of
his
motion
to
suppress
under
the
fourth
amendment
may
not
thereafter
be
admitted
against
him
at
trial
on
the
issue
of
guilt
unless
he
makes
no
objection
and
this
use
restriction
rule
of
simmons
essentially
removes
the
dilemma
that
was
confronting
defendants
at
the
time
that
jones
was
deciding
and
then
thereby
eliminates
one
of
the
two
reasons
given
by
the
court
in
jones
for
fashioning
an
automatic
standing
rule.
as
to
the
other
reason
which
was
that
the
government
would
have
the
benefit
of
the
--
the
rule
of
the
automatic
standing
rule
was
fashioned
so
the
government
would
not
have
the
benefit
of
contradictory
positions
as
a
basis
for
conviction.
that’s
also
undermined
by
simmons
cause
that
rational
was
based
on
the
argument
that
if
a
defendant
was
sufficiently
deterred
from
asserting
his
fourth
amendment
right,
so
that
he
remain
silent,
choosing
not
to
acknowledge
any
interest
in
the
premises
search
to
the
property
seized.
but
the
government
would
then
have
the
advantage
of
a
position
on
a
question
of
the
admissibility
of
evidence
that
was
seemingly
inconsistent
with
its
proof
of
lawful
possession
at
trial.
however,
now
that
the
fact
that
it
was
deterred,
defendants
from
moving
to
suppress
has
been
removed
by
simmons,
the
used
restriction
rule
of
simmons.
it
seems
unlikely
that
defendants
will
choose
to
forego
pressing
their
fourth
amendment
claims.
perhaps
even
more
to
the
point,
if
one
is
charged
--
who
is
charged
with
possession
moves
to
suppress
on
grounds
of
illegal
search
or
seizure,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
government
is
required
as
we
understand
the
fundamental
inquiry
for
purposes
of
standing
under
the
fourth
amendment
to
maintain
a
position
inconsistent
with
or
contradictory
to
its
position
at
trial.
in
this
case,
petitioner’s
conviction
flows
from
proof
of
his
knowing
possession
of
the
stolen
whiskey
before
and
at
the
time
of
the
search.
if
the
admissibility
into
evidence
of
the
fruits
of
that
search,
on
the
ground
the
petitioner
lacks
standing
is
perfectly
consistent
we
think,
but
the
theory
that
petitioner
have
constructed
possession
of
the
whiskey
at
all
relevant
times.
his
standing
depends
upon
some
showing
of
an
intrusion
of
privacy
of
his
own
person,
his
own
house,
his
own
papers
or
his
own
effects,
or
an
intrusion
on
premises
in
which
he
personally
had
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy.
in
the
absence
of
such
a
showing,
the
evidence
is
admissible
without
regard
to
whether
petitioner
might
claim
which
he
never
has
done
in
this
case
that
he
possessed
the
stolen
whiskey.
it
would
thus
be
no
need
for
the
government
to
dispute
such
a
claim
on
a
motion
to
suppress.
in
sum,
we
do
not
believe
that
he
had
the
fundamental
purpose
of
the
fourth
amendment
to
protect
individual
privacy,
or
the
dual
rational
of
jones
v.
united
states
when
read
in
light
of
this
court’s
subsequent
decision
in
simmons.
warrants
and
application
of
auto
--
of
the
automatic
standing
rule
to
one
charge
with
lawless
possession
on
the
sole
basis
for
its
fourth
amendment
claim
is
the
seizure
of
stolen
property
in
which
he
has
no
legitimate
proprietary
interest
and
with
respect
to
which
he
can
have
no
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
your
honor,
i
don’t
believe
i
have
an
answer
as
to
why
they
did
not
raise
a
standing
point.
the
government
failed
to
raise
it.
it
raised
it
for
the
first
time
in
the
court
of
appeals.
no
objection
was
made
by
petitioner
at
that
time.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
it
was
argued
in
the
briefs
and
it
was
argued
on
petition
for
rehearing.
the
court
of
appeals
decided
the
question
on
the
standing
issue
alone
and
at
no
time
in
the
court
of
appeals
was
an
objection
made
to
the
fact
that
the
standing
issue
had
not
been
raised
in
the
district
court.
when
the
court
came
here
--
when
the
case
came
here
on
petition
for
certiorari,
there
was
no
objection
to
that
--
to
the
fact
that
it
had
not
been
raised
below.
the
petition
was
addressed
itself
solely
to
the
point
that
we’re
discussing
here
going
to
the
standing.
in
the
merits
brief,
there
was
also
no
objection
raised
on
that
point,
on
petitioner’s
merits
brief.
again,
addressing
himself
solely
to
the
standing
question.
now
in
jones,
v.
united
states,
the
same
one
we’ve
been
discussing
at
362,
this
court
had
a
similar
situation
before
it
and
said
that
the
question
was
properly
before
it
in
the
circumstances
and
if
they
could
decide
the
issue.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
was
going
to
–
i
was
about
to
mention,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
correct,
i
believe
that
the
case,
if
we
or
we
prevail,
we
believe
the
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
an
opportunity
to
determine
the
interest
whether
it
was
a
sufficient
interest
in
the
premises
search.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
believe
that’s
correct
your
honor.
the
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
and
he
is
the
petitioner.
if
our
argument
is
accepted
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
believe
that
if
the
case
is
remanded
for
the
purposes
of
a
hearing,
it
would
have
to
reversed
and
vacated.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
the
fact
finder
has
never
yet
heard
the
stand.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
the
father
was
convicted
and
did
not
have
the
appropriate
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
the
brother
was
not
convicted.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
in
the
same
time
trial,
your
honor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
no,
there
was
no
conspiracy
alleged.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
it
was
a
joint
trial,
there
was
no
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
believe
there
could
be
a
remand
before
the
--
to
hear
on
the
evidence
on
the
suppression
hearing
without
--
before
doing
that
--
vacating
the
judgment.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
yes,
your
honor,
that
would
be
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
no!
no,
just
the
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
the
court
of
appeals
judgment.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
the
court
of
appeals
but
–
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
we
think
that
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
could
remain
in
effect
until
such
time
as
you
had
the
hearing.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
on
the
suppression.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
right.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
yes,
perhaps
vacation
might
have
been
a
better
choice
of
word.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well
he
is
--
in
this
case
the
defendant
was
charged
with
receiving,
possessing
and
concealing
tax
paid
whiskey
that
have
been
stolen
from
an
interstate
shipment
knowing
it
to
be
stolen.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
correct
your
honor.
we
don’t
believe
that
the
element
of
possession
should
have
a
bearing
on
the
question
of
the
fourth
amendment
question.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
with
respect
to
stolen
goods.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
at
the
trial.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
yes
it
is,
it
is
an
element
of
the
offense
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
under
this
indictment.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
to
be
guilty
under
this
indictment.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
correct.
is
that,
yes
sir.
