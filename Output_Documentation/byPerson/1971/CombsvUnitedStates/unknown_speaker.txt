unknown
speaker
because?
what
was
your
argument
there?
because
what?
unknown
speaker
or
they
did
it
--
the
argument
was
deferred?
unknown
speaker
a
what?
unknown
speaker
let’s
assume
you
went
on
that,
that
he
--
unknown
speaker
that
he
had
no
interest
in
the
property
–
in
the
real
property?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
there’s
some
doubt
about
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
seem
to
think
there
is
a
--
do
you
think
there
really
is
some
substantial
question
that
if
the
policeman
comes
upon
--
legally,
comes
upon
stolen
property,
he
can’t
seize
it?
if
the
--
if
it’s
evident,
i
mean
if
he
has
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
property
is
stolen?
unknown
speaker
is
that
in
doubt?
unknown
speaker
what
about
historically,
regardless
of
the
--
of
what
the
scope
of
the
incident
to
arrest
searches
whether
it’s
very
narrow
or
broad?
when
you
make
an
arrest
and
you
seize
evidence,
just
evidence
or
contraband
or
stolen
property
that
you
find
on
the
person,
is
there
any
question
that
the
police
may
seize
that?
unknown
speaker
and
that
the
reason
they
may
seize
it
under
the
fourth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
well,
what’s
the
difference
here
if
the
police
are
legally
where
they
are,
why
they
can’t
they
seize
the
property
that
they
recognize
as
having
been
stolen
or
they
at
least
they
have
reasonable
grounds
to
think
that
it’s
stolen?
unknown
speaker
well,
except
as
i
understand
it,
you
now
concede
that
they
were
not
legally
where
they
were,
that
they
were
there
by
reason
of
an
invalid
insufficient
search
warrant?
unknown
speaker
and
you
begin
on
the
premise
that
they
were
not
legally
where
they
were
there.
unknown
speaker
and
the
question
is
whether
or
not
this
person
has
a
standing
to
raise
that
illegality?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
don’t
you
concede
from
your
--
what
you
suggest
ought
to
be
done
to
this
case
that
he
had
--
that
he
will
win
this
case
if
he
can
show
he
has
a
sufficient
interest
in
the
real
property?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
but
do
you
conceive
standing
to
claim
that
there
was
an
invasion
of
his
fourth
amendment
rights
by
entering
the
real
property?
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
certainly
--
but
there
is
a
--
do
you
think
you
must
also
show
or
do
anything
about
the
personal
property
that
was
seized?
let’s
assume
you
win
on
the
--
on
remand.
assume
this
case
was
remanded
and
you
won
and
were
–
and
that
it
was
shown
that
he
had
no
interest
in
the
real
property
such
as
to
make
this
entry
an
invasion
of
his
fourth
amendment
rights.
unknown
speaker
is
the
case
over
then
or
not?
unknown
speaker
yes,
he
can.
unknown
speaker
about
the
entry
to
the
property?
unknown
speaker
then
how
about
the
fourth
amendment,
supposedly
protects
against
seizure
of
effects?
unknown
speaker
let’s
assume
that
if
--
instead
of
a
whiskey,
stolen
whiskey,
it
was
heroin,
which
did
belong
to
him
that
he
had
bought
and
paid
for
and
in
that
sense
they
belonged
to
him
--
it
belonged
to
him?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
doesn’t
have
to
be,
does
it?
it
doesn’t
have
to
be.
you’re
talking
here
about
stolen
property.
unknown
speaker
i
suggest
that
although
you
don’t
see
a
distinction
between
contraband
and
stolen
goods
that
there
might
be
one?
there
may
be
in
terms
of
what
you
argue
in
your
case,
in
your
brief
because
you
are
saying
it
doesn’t
belong
to
him?
right,
exactly.
unknown
speaker
how
about
if
you
--
what
about
if
you’re
legally
in
a
place
and
you
see
some
evidence
of
a
crime
that
unquestionably
belongs
to
the
defendant?
unknown
speaker
let’s
assume
you’re
searching
a
house
with
the
consent
of
the
owner?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
that,
you
couldn’t
seize
it
if
there
was
a
--
if
it
was
evidence
of
a
crime?
unknown
speaker
but
could
he
win?
unknown
speaker
because
they
were
not
his
personal
effects,
they
belong
to
somebody
else,
that’s
your
basic
position.
unknown
speaker
because
as
i
say
again
as
i
understand
your
position
here,
at
least,
you
conceded
that
this
was
an
unreasonable
search.
unknown
speaker
that
this
search
violated
the
fourth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
alright.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
you
--
if
prevail
like
--
it
gets
that
perhaps
if
the
other
side
if
--
it
does
happens
while
the
other
side
is
prevailing
in
sense
that
the
judgment
below
is
going
to
be
vacated?
unknown
speaker
in
the
petition.
unknown
speaker
do
you
ask
--
you
asked
if
the
judgment
below
be
reversed,
in
looking
at
page
42
of
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
vacated
that
reversed.
unknown
speaker
because
there
was
never
any
opportunity
for
such
an
investigation
in
the
district
court.
unknown
speaker
we’re
going
to
have
a
factual
examination
of
the
--
unknown
speaker
and
i
take
that
the
father
convicted
with
--
unknown
speaker
the
brother
was
not
convicted?
unknown
speaker
in
a
separate
trial?
unknown
speaker
in
the
same
trial,
was
it
--
was
there
conspiracy
alleged?
unknown
speaker
kind
of
a
shotwell
(ph)
technique.
is
that
what
your
position
here?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
i
take
the
judgment
with
what
you
vacate?
unknown
speaker
should
be
reversed,
that’s
what
you
say
on
page
42.
unknown
speaker
yes.
and
what
does
--
and
what
has
that
--
and
what
does
that
do
to
the
judgment
of
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
what
we’re
talking
about
i
gather
is
--
shotwell.
you
sent
it
back
and
as
the
district
court
finds
that
there’s
no
merit,
no
standing
but
then
he
reinstates
the
judgment
of
conviction
without
warrant,
isn’t
that
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
that’s
shotwell
or
it’s
been
done
in
–
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
it’s
been
done
in
all
the
line
up
cases
in
such.
unknown
speaker
are
we
indulging
in
semantics
in
the
difference
between
the
reversal
and
vacation
of
the
judgment?
it
sounds
to
me
as
we
might
be?
unknown
speaker
when
you
asked
for
a
reversal.
i
wonder
whether
you
really
mean
a
vacation.
unknown
speaker
mr.
reynolds,
may
i
come
back
to
a
point
you’ve
touched
on
that
i’m
not
entirely
clear
about.
would
it
be
necessary
in
this
case
for
the
government
to
allege
possession?
would
not
--
there
have
been
a
crime
committed
if
the
government
had
alleged
that
the
whiskey
was
stolen
and
transported
in
interstate
commerce?
unknown
speaker
but
you
do
state
as
i
understand
it
and
i
wondered,
i
have
the
same
question
in
my
mind
as
that
expressed
by
mr.
justice
powell
apparently.
you
do
state
that
possession
is
an
element
of
the
offense
to
be
proved.
unknown
speaker
at
the
least
under
this
indictment?
unknown
speaker
not
just
--
unknown
speaker
not
just
the
theft
or
the
concealment
causing
it
to
be
concealed.
he
has
to
have
himself
possession,
actual
and
constructive
to
be
guilty
under
this
indictment.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
could
i
ask
him
a
question
mr.
chief
justice?
unknown
speaker
he
is
in
the
federal
prison?
unknown
speaker
he
was
on
appeal
bond.
so
it
wouldn’t
it
make
any
difference?
unknown
speaker
in
terms
of
the
good
time
or
credit
on
the
sentence?
unknown
speaker
oh!
sorry.
unknown
speaker
because?
what
was
your
argument
there?
because
what?
unknown
speaker
or
they
did
it
--
the
argument
was
deferred?
unknown
speaker
a
what?
unknown
speaker
let’s
assume
you
went
on
that,
that
he
--
unknown
speaker
that
he
had
no
interest
in
the
property
–
in
the
real
property?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
there’s
some
doubt
about
that?
unknown

well,
you

there
