now,
how
is
your
case
different
from
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
all
you’re
claiming
is
a
basis
for
attacking
the
warrant
is
the
claim
of
possession
in
the
goods,
isn’t
it?
not
any
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
property
owned
by
the
defendant’s
father?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
the

supposing
your
client
had
planted
the
liquor
on
some
farm
of
a
complete
stranger,
would
that
case
from
your
point
of
view
been
a
--
different
than
this
one?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
thought
you’re
arguing
a
minute
ago
that
your
principle
contention
was
violation
of
the
expectation
of
privacy
on
the
farm.
now,
are
you
also
saying
that
you’re
claiming
of
right
in
the
liquor
itself,
which
was
violated
by
a
seizure
without
an
appropriate
warrant?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
liquor
was
taken
from
you
before
this.
you
mean
give
up
something
in
the
sense
of
a
concession
related
–
the
merits
of
a
criminal
charge?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course
the
reason
that
the
government
might
not

raised
that

is
that
they
got
a
favorable
ruling
on
the
validity
of
the
search
warrant
affidavit.
justice
william

you
thought

of

on
the

of

affidavit
on

on

standing

mr.
reynolds,
what’s
your
