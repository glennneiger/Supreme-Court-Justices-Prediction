justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
be
satisfied
if
it
were
held
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
did
not
incorporate
these
terms
of
the
contract
that
did
not
have
to
but
that
a
contract
made
pursuant
to
this
authorization
of
the
federal
statute,
is
enough
in
itself
to
present
a
federal
question,
(inaudible)
federal
court.
i
know
you
would
like
to
have
the
right
answer
given
by
the
court
but
would
you
be
satisfied
as
far
as
jurisdiction
is
concerned?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
you
would
raise
the
same
question,
may
subsequent
agreement
modified
either
a
prior
agreement
or
an
order
the
commission?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
we
could
reduce
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
what
i
mean.
it
may
lower
benefit,
it
may
have
something
in
the
agreement
lower
the
benefit?
would
you
say
no?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
would
you
say
that
whether
the
prior
right
you
are
claiming
is
stated
in
the
contract
or
commission
order.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
those
questions
are
inevitably
in
the
case?
