justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
that
not
one
of
the
point
here
as
to
what
that
first
agreement
means,
it
is
arguable
that
is
there
any
more
than
that
provided
further
that
none
of
such
employees
shall
be
deprived
of
the
employment
or
placed
in
a
worst
position
with
respect
to
compensation
at
any
time
during
such
employment,
except
and
so
forth,
does
that
mean
just
a
partial
years
employment?
it
does
not
mean
a
four-year,
is
it
arguable
is
what
i
am
asking,
mr.
