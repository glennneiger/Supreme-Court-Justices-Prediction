unknown
speaker
can
i
ask
you,
that
the
commission
does
incorporate
in
its
order
the
terms
of
an
agreement
entered
into
between
the
union
and
the
company,
may
the
union
and
the
company
after
the
commission
enters
its
order,
arrive
in
an
agreement
different
from
what
the
commission
has
put
in
its
order?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
your
view?
unknown
speaker
contrary
for
setting
different
terms
--
unknown
speaker
and
do
you
not
have
to
win
on
that
point
to
win
this
case?
unknown
speaker
exactly.
unknown
speaker
let
us
assume
that
the
prior
agreement
and
the
commission's
order
have
terms
in
them
that
are
different
from
the
later
agreement.
unknown
speaker
so,
to
win
you
have
got
to
overturn
then
i
take
it
or
you
would
like
to
overturn
the
construction
of
the
prior
agreement,
given
to
that
agreement
by
the
district
court
and
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
that
is
one
point.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
to
my
understanding,
then
go
on,
supposedly
commission’s
order
is
an
order
pursuant
to
the
first
two
sentences
of
section.
and
it
becomes
operative
for
a
year,
year
and
a
half,
then
the
unions
and
the
carrier,
and
what
carrier
would
that
be?
the
surviving
carrier
or
merger
sit
down
and
make
a
brand
new
agreement
that
then
supersedes
the
board’s
order,
is
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
is
that
by
reason
of
the
proviso
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
does
not
happen
in
the
subsequent
agreement?
unknown
speaker
what
has
been
the
practice
since
5
(2)
(f)
came
on
the
books,
when
the
merger
is
contemplated,
do
the
unions
and
the
carriers
sit
down
and
workout
these
preliminary
agreements
before
the
approval
of
the
--
unknown
speaker
which
has
been
the
--
is
that
more
generally
the
case?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
reference
made
to
such
agreements
when
are
completely
executed
before
the
approval
in
the
order
of
approval,
is
there
any
reference
in
the
order
of
approval?
unknown
speaker
it
is
order
of
approval,
is
there
any
reference
(voice
overlap)
-
unknown
speaker
no,
first
or
second
sentence
of
provisions
at
all?
unknown
speaker
under
the
first
two
sentences?
unknown
speaker
i
have
just
one
other
question
in
that
is,
if
you
should
prevail
here,
do
these
claimant’s,
your
opposition,
have
any
place
to
go?
unknown
speaker
here
is
an
initial
agreement
in
1962
and
we
just
ignore
the
commission's
order
on
theory
of
the
case,
then
we
have
a
subsequent
agreement,
and
that
subsequent
agreement
just
purports
to
interpret
the
prior
agreement.
it
does
not
take
the
approach,
if
prior
agreement
says
'a'
and
we
are
going
to
change
the
protections
that
the
1962
agreement
set-up,
is
that
not
correct?
unknown
speaker
now,
would
you
say
that
the
subsequent
agreement
if
it
took
the
approach
that
we
are
going
to
change
the
protectors
of
‘62
agreement
would
nevertheless
be
valid.
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
suppose
the
statute
would
intended
to
give
such
an
agreement
any
validity
that
did
not
otherwise
have.
unknown
speaker
what?
unknown
speaker
that
is
wholly
aside
from
the
statute,
do
you
think
a
union
and
a
employer
may
renegotiate
downward,
the
benefits
of
a
prior
collective
bargaining
contract?
unknown
speaker
subject
only
i
suppose
to
vaca
against
sipes
considerations
of
good
faith
representation.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
this,
thus
i
will
not
hold
you
anymore.
let
us
suppose
we
disagreed
with
you
and
agreed
with
the
courts
below
that
the
subsequent
agreement
actually
changed
the
1962
agreement.
that
the
1962
agreement
meant
one
thing
and
the
‘65
agreement
meant
the
other,
in
short
we
disagreed
with
the
union
and
the
company
as
to
what
the
‘62
agreement
meant.
what
should
we
do
then,
because
the
both
courts
below
have
given
a
construction
of
the
‘62
agreement
contrary
to
your
point.
now,
we
agree
with
the
two
courts
below
then
affirmance
would
have
to
rest
on
the
idea
that
even
if
the
two
parties
negotiating
had
thought
they
were
changing
the
‘62
agreement,
they
nevertheless
would
have
changed
them.
i
am
not
sure
they
would
have.
let
us
assume
the
‘62
agreement
had
clearly
said
earnings
are
to
be
measured
by
reference
to
the
entire
toledo
division.
it
could
have
been
any
argument
about
it,
and
then
the
two
parties
sat
down.
do
you
think
they
would
nevertheless
come
out
saying
we
are
going
to
reduce
that
pay
and
measure
it
by
the
sandusky
service
at
all?
unknown
speaker
well
it
has
happened,
but
what
should
we
do?
should
we
assume
that
or
what
would
we
have
to
remand
it?
unknown
speaker
i
am
just
assuming,
assume
we
agreed
with
them.
unknown
speaker
but
the
court
is
already,
the
district
court
and
court
of
appeals
have
already
said
that
the
62
agreement
has
been
modified
by
the
‘65
agreement.
unknown
speaker
if
you
would
you
apply
5
(2)
(f)
there
must
be
without
the
guard
to
whether
there
are
prior
agreements
or
not,
at
the
time
of
approval,
a
provision
imposed
by
the
icc
under
sections
1
and
2?
unknown
speaker
and
then
you
go
on
from
that
to
say
that
the
notwithstanding
clause
then
is
limited
in
application
to
implementing
agreements,
that
is
agreements
which
implement
that
provision?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
i
just
want
to
be
sure
though.although
you
do
concede,
i
gather
this
is
under
the
notwithstanding
clause
that
unions
and
the
railroads
may
enter
into
agreements
before
the
merger
and
after
the
merger,
you
nevertheless
contend
that
there
must
be
section
1
and
2
conditions
imposed
by
the
icc
in
the
order
of
approval,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
if
as
you
have
said
that
the
5
(2)
(f)
has
to
be
interpreted,
by
saying,
“yes,
you
may
have
a
prior
agreement,
but
there
must
be
protective
provisions
in
the
board's
order
of
approval.”
suppose
you
have
a
prior
agreement
that
gives
less
protection
than
the
provisions
in
the
board’s
order,
which
prevails?
unknown
speaker
supposed
they
had
said
earning
were
to
be
--
the
board
order
said
earnings
were
to
be
based
on
legal
service.
but
the
prior
agreement
said
earnings
would
be
computed
on
the
basis
on
sandusky
service.
which
would
prevail,
even
though
the
unions
and
the
railroads
entered
into
the
earlier
sandusky
basis
agreement
pursuant
to
the
notwithstanding
clause.
unknown
speaker
what
you
are
really
saying
is
the
board
order
and
not
the
prior
agreement
would
be
holding
requirement.
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
way
i
see
in
its
amicus
brief,
concede
that,
since
it
may
enter
supplemental
order
and
award
supplemental
benefits
over
and
above
any
agreement?
unknown
speaker
can
i
ask
you,
that
the
commission
does
incorporate
in
its
order
the
terms
of
an
agreement
entered
into
between
the
union
and
the
company,
may
the
union
and
the
company
after
the
commission
enters
its
order,
arrive
in
an
agreement
different
from
what
the
commission
has
put
in
its
order?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
your
view?
unknown
speaker
contrary
for
setting
different
terms
--
unknown
speaker
and
do
you
not
have
to
win
on
that
point
to
win
this
case?
unknown
speaker
exactly.
unknown
speaker
let
us

that
the
prior
agreement
and
the
commission's
order
have
terms
in
them
that
are
different
from

unknown
speaker
so,
to
win
you
have
got
to
overturn
then
i
take
it
or
you
would
like
to
overturn
the
construction
of
