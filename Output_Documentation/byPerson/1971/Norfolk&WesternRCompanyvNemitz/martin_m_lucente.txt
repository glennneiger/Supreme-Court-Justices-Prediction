this
is
not
in
anticipation
of
the
argument
in
fact.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
primary
question
presented
by
this
case
involves
section
5
(2)
(f)
in
the
interstate
commerce
act.
initial
provisions
of
that
section
required
interstate
commerce
commission
as
a
prerequisite,
the
approval
of
a
merger
to
impose
protective
conditions
for
the
benefit
of
employees
affected
by
the
transaction.
that
last
sentence
as
an
alternative
to
the
imposition
of
conditions
by
the
commission,
provide
that
not
withstanding
any
other
provisions
of
the
act,
in
agreement
pertaining
to
the
protection
of
employees
maybe
entered
into
by
any
carrier
and
a
duly
authorize
representative
that
with
its
employees.
at
issue
here,
the
relationship
between
the
commission’s
authority
to
impose
protective
conditions
and
the
right
of
representatives,
their
carriers
and
their
employees
to
enter
into
agreements
concerning
that
subject.
the
claims
asserted
by
the
respondents
in
this
case
arise
out
of
the
1964
merger
of
the
nickel
plate,
norfolk
and
western
and
several
other
carriers.
as
a
part
of
that
transaction,
the
norfolk
and
western
required
the
sandusky
line
from
the
pennsylvania
railroad.
the
respondents
were
employed
by
the
pennsylvania
and
worked
on
the
sandusky
line
prior
to
its
sale
to
the
norfolk
and
western.
his
employees
seek
certain
payments
which
they
contend
they
are
entitled
to
under
the
commission’s
order
approving
the
merger.
when
the
n
and
w
sought
commission
approval
of
the
merger
approximately
20
railroad
unions
intervened
in
opposition
and
asked
the
commission
to
impose
protective
conditions
by
the
benefit
of
employees
who
might
be
affected.
following
extensive
negotiations
however,
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen
which
representative
respondents
and
the
other
unions
entered
in
to
an
employee
protection
agreement
with
the
norfolk
and
western
dated
january
10,
1962.
this
agreement
which
we
cited
that
it
was
made
pursuant
to
the
last
sentence
of
section
5(2)(f)
provided
a
type
of
employee
protection
which
differed
significantly
from
that
which
section
5(2)(f)
requires
when
the
commission
imposes
protective
conditions.
and
protective
benefits
are
prescribed
by
the
commission
and
employees
pre-merger
compensation
must
be
protected
for
a
period
of
four
years
or
for
the
number
of
years
of
employment
prior
to
the
merger
whichever
is
less.
there
is
no
guarantee
of
continued
employment
and
the
protection
flows
only
from
the
employing
carrier.
when
the
protective
benefits
are
prescribed
with
the
1962
agreement
however
when
far
beyond
this
type
of
protection
and
constituted
in
effect
a
lifetime
guarantee
of
employment
and
compensation.
initial
paragraph,
the
agreement
provided
that
with
respect
to
nickel
plate
employees,
n
and
w
would
take
such
employees
into
his
employment
would
guarantee
that
they
would
not
be
adversely
affected
with
respect
to
employment
or
compensation
subsequent
to
the
merger.
paragraph
2
of
the
agreement
provided
the
same
thing
for
wabash
employees.
section
3
of
the
agreement
covered
the
pennsylvania
employees
on
the
sandusky
line,
they
were
given
an
option
first
to
remain
with
the
pennsylvania
or
to
become
employees
of
the
n
and
w.
section
3
provided
that
those
electing
n
and
w
employment
would
not
be
deprived
of
employment
or
placing
the
worst
position
with
respect
to
compensation
except
and
i
quote
“that
norfolk
and
western
shall
not
be
required
to
provided
employment
to
any
such
employee
of
greater
duration
than
such
employee
and
joined
under
sandusky
line
in
the
year
prior
to
merger.”
the
written
record
of
the
negotiations
with
respect
to
this
agreement
shows
that
the
parties
by
this
proviso
intended
to
make
the
guarantee
for
pennsylvania
employees,
co-extensive
with
there
pre-merger
employment
experience
on
the
sandusky
line.
in
this
respect,
the
protection
provided
by
section
3
differed
somewhat
from
that
provided
by
sections
1
and
2,
under
sections
1
and
2
the
employees
were
protected
on
the
basis
of
their
full
pre-merger
earnings,
by
protection
for
pennsylvania
employees
was
limited
to
their
earnings
from
the
sandusky
line.
the
reason
for
this
difference
lies
in
the
nature
of
the
transaction.
with
respect
to
the
nickel
plate
and
wabash
employees
who
were
covered
by
sections
1
and
2,
the
pennsylvania
or
the
n
and
w
rather
required
the
entire
working
territory
that
these
employees
held
seniority
rights
over.
the
protection
which
the
n
and
w
provided
was
accordingly
based
on
their
pre-merger
employment
without
limitation.
the
pennsylvania
employees
then
on
the
other
hand
who
worked
on
the
sandusky
line,
also
worked
in
other
portions
of
the
pennsylvania
which
were
not
acquired
by
the
n
and
w.
operations
on
the
sandusky
line
or
maine
by
employees
of
the
pennsylvania
who
had
seniority
right
over
the
entire
toledo
division.
sandusky
line
was
a
only
part
of
the
toledo
division.
these
employees
worked
part
of
the
time
on
the
sandusky
line
and
part
of
the
time
another
portions
of
the
toledo
division.
when
the
n
and
w
acquired
the
sandusky
line
it
thus
acquired
only
a
portion
of
the
working
territory
of
these
employees
and
it
offered
protection
limited
to
the
portion
of
the
territory
acquired.
this
type
of
protection
was
intended
primarily
to
discourage
an
excessive
transfer
of
pennsylvania
employees
to
the
n
and
w
pursuant
to
the
option
which
i
have
already
referred
to.
if
a
transfer
appeared
attractive
only
to
those
with
full
time
earnings
on
the
sandusky
line,
it
was
assumed
that
a
sufficient
number
of
employees
would
remain
with
the
pennsylvania
to
permit
it,
to
man
its
operation
on
the
remaining
portions
of
the
toledo
division
and
that
the
number
electing
employment
with
the
n
and
w
would
be
fairly
consistent
with
the
operational
need
down
the
acquired
line.
despite
this
purpose
some
employee
with
limited
earnings
on
the
sandusky
line
did
elect
to
become
n
and
w
employees.
the
respondent
in
this
situation,
in
this
case
rather,
illustrate
the
situation.
prior
to
the
merger,
the
respondents
here
worked
primarily
on
other
portions
of
the
toledo
division
spending
only
very
limited
time
on
the
sandusky
line.
they
nevertheless
chose
to
abandon
their
former
working
territory
and
to
limit
themselves
to
the
sandusky
line,
which
had
provided
only
minimal
work
opportunities
for
them.
had
these
employees
remained
with
the
pennsylvania,
it
is
unlikely
that
the
sale
of
the
sandusky
line
would
have
any
appreciable
effect
on
their
earnings.
to
return
to
the
chronology
events,
the
commission
approved
the
merger
in
1964.
its
report
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
employee
representatives
in
the
n
and
w
had
entered
into
an
agreement
pertaining
to
employee
protection
and
as
to
such
employees
the
commission
found
that
in
view
of
the
agreement,
no
conditions
be
imposed
for
the
protection
of
those
employees
covered
by
such
agreements.
now,
with
respect
to
employees
not
covered
by
the
agreement,
the
commission
did
prescribe
and
imposed
in
its
order
of
approval
the
traditional
for
your
income
protection
with
section
5
2
f
requires
in
those
circumstances.
the
approved
transactions
were
consummated
in
october
1964.
during
the
month
immediately
following
the
n
and
w
and
the
brotherhood
attempted
to
compute
protective
benefit
due
to
the
sandusky
line
employees.
the
n
and
w
was
able
to
obtain
from
the
pennsylvania
earnings
data
pertaining
only
to
total
earnings
over
the
toledo
division.
it
was
unable
to
obtain
in
the
initial
stages
following
the
merger,
a
break
down
showing
wages
earned
on
the
sandusky
line
alone.
it
was
consequently
impossible
on
basis
of
that
data
to
determine
the
benefits
due
to
employees
under
section
3.
accordingly,
an
implementing
agreement
and
a
letter
of
understanding
were
entered
into.
the
letter
of
understanding
provided
for
monetary
payments
which
met
the
immediate
needs
of
the
employees,
while
the
implementing
agreement
contained
a
very
detailed
formula
with
respect
to
the
calculation
of
benefits.
the
agreement
very
expressly
provided
that
such
benefits
were
to
be
determined
by
taking
the
total
compensation
received
by
the
affected
employees
for
service
performed
on
the
sandusky
line
in
12
months
prior
to
merger
and
dividing
by
12.
following
this
disposition
of
the
matter
several
of
the
employees,
former
pennsylvania
employees,
complained
to
their
union
officials
that
implementing
agreement
1a
and
the
letter
of
understanding
did
not
provide
the
payment
that
they
were
entitled
to
under
the
1962
agreement.
these
employees
contented
that
the
1962
agreement
protected
entire
earnings
over
the
entire
toledo
division
that
implementing
agreement
1a
gave
them
something
less.
the
brotherhood
officials,
who
had
negotiated
these
agreement,
advised
the
complaining
employees
that
their
interpretation
of
the
1962
agreement
was
wrong
and
that
implementing
agreement
1a
as
fully
consistent
with
the
1962
agreement.
the
complaining
employees
were
then
afforded
to
full
hearing
before
the
brotherhood
of
national
board
of
appeals
where
their
position
was
fully
presented
and
thoroughly
considered.
the
employees
also
urged
before
the
board
that
the
question
of
the
meaning
of
the
1962
agreement
at
relationship
to
the
implementing
agreement
1a
should
be
taken
to
arbitration
and
as
provided
by
the
agreement.
the
brotherhood's
national
board
of
appeals,
is
very
highest
appellate
body
concluded
that
the
position
taken
by
the
employees
was
without
merit
and
that
implementing
agreement
1a
was
entirely
consistent
with
the
1962
agreement.
the
board
also
did
conclude
that
there
was
no
disagreement
between
brotherhood
and
the
n
and
w
as
to
the
meaning
of
these
agreements
and
it
consequently
inclined
to
invoke
arbitration.
employees
then
instituted
the
present
action
under
section
9
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
under
theory
that
the
n
and
w
had
acted
contrary
to
the
1962
agreement,
that
the
commission
had
incorporated
the
1962
agreement
in
to
its
order,
that
the
n
and
w
had
therefore
violated
an
order
of
interstate
commerce
commission.
the
n
and
w
moved
for
dismissal
in
summary
judgment
under
ground,
one,
that
the
court
was
without
jurisdiction
since
the
action
was
going
to
enforce
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
not
an
order
of
the
commission.
two,
the
arbitration
procedures
of
the
1962
agreement
were
alternatively
the
process
of
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
provided
exclusive
remedies
and
three,
that
implementing
agreement
1a
governed
the
rights
of
the
employees
in
this
matter.
district
court
denied
these
motions
but
granted
a
cross
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
issued
to
declaratory
judgment
upholding
the
1962
agreement
interpretation
for
which
the
respondents
contended.
the
court
of
appeal
deferred
holding
that
under
section
5
(2)
(f),
the
commission
must
prescribe
protection
for
affected
employees
whether
or
not
a
prior
agreement
on
this
subject
has
been
made.
the
court
acknowledged
the
commission
had
expressly
disclaimed
any
intent
or
obligation
to
prescribe
protective
conditions
but
it
held
that
the
commission
order
must
nevertheless
be
construed
to
impose
the
provisions
of
the
1962
agreement,
because
of
the
court’s
view
of
the
meaning
of
the
section
5
(2)
(f).
the
court
accordingly
concluded
that
the
right
set
forth
in
the
1962
agreement
were
incorporated
in
the
1964
order
and
for
purposes
of
federal
court
jurisdiction
stand
from
such
order.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
had
just
described
to
the
holdings
of
the
courts
below.
i
should
now
like
to
discuss
the
respects
in
which
we
can
consider
those
decisions
to
be
wrong.
the
basic
and
primary
error
of
the
decisions
below
concerns
the
conclusion
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
as
required
by
section
5
(2)
(f)
of
the
act
to
prescribe
protection
for
employees
despite
the
existence
of
a
prior
collective
bargaining
agreement
on
this
subject.
in
terms
of
the
act,
its
legislative
history,
it
clearly
show
that
congress
intended
to
preserve
for
the
parties
to
a
merger,
the
right
to
resolve
employee
protection
problems
reflect
to
bargaining
and
that
an
agreement
on
the
subject
was
to
be
a
self
sustaining
alternative
to
the
prescription
of
conditions
by
the
commission.
this
is
apparent
both
in
the
terms
of
the
act
and
its
legislative
history.
respect
to
the
letter
structure
of
the
act,
the
first
two
sentences
require
the
commission
as
a
part
of
its
approval
of
a
covered
transaction
to
prescribe
conditions
for
the
benefit
of
affected
employees.
the
last
sentence
specifically
provide
that
not
withstanding
any
other
provision
of
the
act,
representatives
of
the
carrier
and
there
employees
may
enter
into
agreements
pertaining
to
protection
of
employee.
the
only
possible
reason
for
the
inclusion
of
this
not
withstanding
language
was
to
ensure
that
nothing
in
the
act
would
be
construed
to
limit
the
right
to
make
agreements
and
to
require
any
questions
in
this
regard
to
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
party's
right
to
make
collective
bargaining
agreements
pertaining
to
employee
protection.
the
only
provisions
of
the
act
which
relates
in
any
way
to
employee
protection
are
the
provisions
section
5
(2)
(f).
the
first
two
sentences
of
that
section
are
thus
the
only
possible
source
of
restrictions
on
the
party's
rights
to
agree
to
employee
protection
would
seem
indisputable
therefore
that
the
notwithstanding
clause
of
section
5
(2)
(f)
eliminates
any
restrictions
on
the
collective
bargaining
process
which
might
otherwise
be
inferred
from
the
first
two
sentences
relating
to
the
commission's
authority
and
obligations
in
the
premises.
this
apparent
literal
meaning
is
amply
confirmed
by
the
legislative
history
of
the
section.
this
history
shows
that
section
5
was
the
results
of
an
agreement
between
labor
and
management
that
congress
enacted
the
substantive
provisions
upon
which
the
parties
agreed.
the
labor
spokesman
for
the
sponsoring
group
stated
at
the
so
called
washington
job
protection
agreement
provided
a
suitable
protection
in
the
event
of
a
merger
and
that
labor
would
not
be
seeking
legislation
on
the
subject
at
all,
were
not
for
the
fact
that
approximately
15%
of
the
railroads
were
not
parties
to
the
agreement.
this
spokesman
said
that
if
we
could
get
all
of
the
roads
into
the
agreement,
we
would
not
even
suggest
protection
as
a
matter
of
law.
thus
the
requirement
that
the
commission
imposed
protection
for
employees
was
intended
to
be
operative
only
in
the
event
that
a
voluntary
agreement
had
not
been
reached
on
this
subject
prior
to
commission
approval.
the
principle
congressional
spokesmen
supporting
this
legislation
stated
the
purpose
of
the
section
as
follows
and
i
quote.
“he
proposed
labor
clause,
set-up
specifics
standard
for
the
commission
to
follow.
but
this
provision
also
contained
a
clause
that
permits
the
industry
through
the
processes
of
the
collective
bargaining,
to
work
out
its
problems
in
a
democratic
manner.”
the
congressmen
primarily
involved
in
the
passage
section
5
(2)
(f)
thus
clearly
expressed
the
view
that
the
language
of
section
5
(2)
(f)
provided
standards
for
the
commission
to
follow
but
only
where
the
parties
did
not
resolve
employee
protection
problems
through
a
voluntary
collective
bargaining
agreement.
this
legislative
history
revealed
that
every
group,
that
was
active
in
sponsoring
section
5
(2)
(f)
was
opposed
to
agency
dictated
protection
in
every
merger
and
was
insistent
that
the
process
of
collective
bargaining
be
preserved
as
an
alternative
to
agency
prescription
of
protective
conditions.
despite
this
overwhelming
evidence
of
the
purpose
and
meaning
of
section
5
(2)
(f),
the
courts
below
construed
the
severely
limited
ability
of
unions
and
the
carriers
to
enter
into
agreements
with
respect
to
the
protection
and
to
require
the
commission
to
impose
protection
in
every
instance.
the
decisions
below
effectively
eliminate
the
last
sentence
of
section
5
(2)
(f)
as
an
operative
portion
of
the
statute.
under
these
decisions,
the
commission
is
required
to
review
agreements
relating
to
employee
protection,
to
determine
their
adequacy
and
to
impose
the
terms
and
conditions
which
it
considers
proper.
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
thus
become
nothing
more
than
a
suggestion
to
the
commission
as
to
what
it
might
do
in
the
case
pending
before
it.
if
the
third
sentence
of
section
5
(2)
(f)
were
eliminated
from
the
statute
entirely,
no
one
would
question
the
right
of
labor
and
management
to
enter
into
a
stipulation,
submit
the
stipulation
to
the
commission
suggesting
what
protective
conditions
should
be
imposed.
but
under
the
decision
below
that
is
sole
function
which
is
now
attributable
to
the
last
sentence
of
section
5
(2)
(f),
the
last
sentence
thus
become
a
virtually
meaningless
appendage
to
the
section.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
under
the
decision
below
--.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
my
view
of
the
statute
is
that
if
the
commission
has
entered
an
order
which
imposes
certain
protective
conditions,
the
parties
thereafter,
under
the
last
sentences
of
section
5
(2)
(f),
have
the
right
to
enter
into
an
agreement
--
.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
which
might
be
at
different
terms
in
those
prescribed.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
no.
no
your
honor,
we
do
not
because
in
this
case
the
agreement
upon
which
we
rely
principally
that
the
agreement
that
was
entered
into
prior
to
the
commission’s
order
approval
--
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
this
was
arrived
at
prior
to
the
commission’s
order
of
approval.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
then
we
have
to
convince
you
your
honor
that
under
section
5
(2)
(f)
the
party
subsequent
to
a
merger,
may
collectively
bargain
and
adjust
the
condition
to
suit
what
they
considered
to
be
the
—
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
we
assume
your
honor
that
the
prior
agreement
was
not
incorporated
in
the
commission
authority.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
then
we
need
only
prove
as
i
said
that
under
the
section
5
(2)
(f),
the
parties
have
a
right
to
enter
in
to
such
a
prior
agreement
and
if
any
dispute
arises
as
to
what
the
prior
to
agreement
means
then
there
is
a
process
and
arbitration
and
the
other
administrator
process
is
open
to
determine
that
question.
if
the
prior
agreement
stands
then
your
honor
as
independent
self-sustaining
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
the
party's
right
with
respect
to
are
the
same
with
respect
to
any
other
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
to
the
extent
that
it
provides
for
different
conditions,
it
would,
yes
supersede
the
conditions
imposed—
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
it
is
by
reason
of
the
proviso.
the
proviso
your
honor
relates
both
to
agreements
which
are
made
prior
to
commission
approval
of
a
merger.
and
it
is
also
relates
to
agreement
which
are
made
subsequent
to
commission
approval
of
the
merger.
and
in
both
instances
the
notwithstanding
language
of
that
proviso
is
intended
to
make
it
clear
that
the
parties
may
make
an
agreement
pertaining
to
employee
protection
notwithstanding
the
other
provisions
of
the
act
which
in
effect
means
notwithstanding
the
first
two
sentences
of
that
section.
and
the
first,
two
sentences
of
that
section
are
the
sentences
pursuant
to
which
the
commission
acts
when
it
imposes
protective
conditions.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
there
are
subsequent
agreement
made
your
honor
but
if
the
frequently
happens
that
the
subsequent
agreements
will
implement
or
explain
the
terms
that
fill
in
the
details
that
more
general
provisions
in
the
prior
agreement
and
the
--
so
that
the
process
of
negotiating
with
respect
to
conditions
which
arise
after
the
merger
is
consummated,
is
a
very
vital
and
active
one.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
that
frequently
has
been
the
practice
your
honors.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
that
is
more
generally
the
case
at
least
in
the
last
10
years
than
having
the
commission
prescribe
condition
without
any
prior
agreement
by
the
party.
and
more
general
condition
currently
is
for
the
parties
to
sit
down
and
workout
agreement
pertaining
to
employee
protection
before
the
commission
enters
its
orders.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
the
commission
in
its
report
will
refer
to
those
and
it
did
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
not
in
the
order
of
approval
in
the
form
or
order
of
approval.
but
in
the
report
it
does
set
forth
the
fact
that
the
parties
have
entered
into
an
agreement
and
as
it
does
in
this
case,
it
resides
that
because
the
parties
have
made
an
agreement
pertaining
to
this
subject
there
is
nothing
for
us
to
do
under
section
5
(2)
(f).
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
well,
in
this
case
that
is
right
with
respect
to
employees
covered
by
the
agreement.
that
i
should
add
that
this
additional
detail
that
sometimes
the
agreements
which
are
made
do
not
cover
all
of
the
employees
and
the
commission
in
its
order
of
approval
will
then
impose
terms
and
conditions
where
the
employee
is
not
covered.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
under
the
first
two
sentences.
but
when
an
agreement
has
been
made,
the
invariable
practice
of
the
commission,
and
this
is
discussed
in
detail
in
amicus
brief
which
the
united
states
and
the
commission
has
submitted
in
this
case
your
honor.
in
variable
practice
of
the
commission
where
an
agreement
has
been
made
is
to
recite
that
fact
in
its
report
and
then
to
proceed
to
approve
the
merger
on
the
ground
that
the
agreement
provides
the
protection
required
by
act
and
its
order
need
not
provide
that
protection.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
that
is
undoubtedly
a
situation
your
honor
and
it
permits
the
railroads
and
the
unions
to
workout
into
the
problems
that
are
not
only
directly
relevant
to
employee
protection
but
are
also
relevant
to
other
situations
which
will
arise
in
connection
with
the
merger.
the
great
northern
burlington
merger
for
example
which
is
before
this
court,
the
parties
worked
out
voluminous
agreements,
implementing
the
manner
in
which
the
various
seniority
district
would
be
put
together
on
the
combined
properties,
the
manner
which
trains
would
be
made
and
including
among
the
terms
of
the
agreement
protection
for
employee,
which
is
quite
customary
and
when
these
agreement
are
made
as
they
are
almost
invariably
made
in
current
mergers
for
the
parties
to
workout
problems
of
employee
protection
and
at
the
same
time
to
workout
many
other
labor
relations
problems
that
tended
upon
the
contemplated
merger.
the
whole
thing
fits
together
as
one
bundle
as
it
works.
as
one
of
the
difficulties
of
the
approach
below
that
the
court
looked
at
the
agreements
only
for
this
very
narrow
area
of
whether
it
provides
full
protection
for
four
years
based
on
all
earning
and
it
ignored
all
of
the
other
aspects
of
the
agreement.
and
the
respects
in
which
the
agreement
dealt
with
other
things.
and
dealt
with
them
on
a
very
favorable
basis
as
far
as
the
unions
are
concerned.
one
other
further
point
i
would
like
to
make,
conclusion
is
that
the
lower
court’s
decision
are
also
wrong
because
they
failed
to
give
appropriate
effect
to
this
court’s
holdings
in
republic
steel
versus
maddox
and
in
vaca
versus
sipes
regarding
administrative
remedies
and
the
necessity
of
their
exhaustion
before
judicial
remedies
can
be
invoked.
i
call
the
court's
attention
again
to
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
united
state
and
the
commission
as
discussed
of
the
legislative
history
interstate
commerce
commission’s
interpretation
of
the
statute
and
arrives
at
the
conclusions
which
i
have
stated
with
respect
to
what
section
5
(2)
(f)
mean.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
yes.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
yes,
i
do
your
honor
in
the
district
court,
your
honor,
when
the
complaint
wad
filed
it
alleged
that
the
plaintiff’s
claims
were
based
upon
the
1964
order
of
the
commission.
in
a
number
of
paragraph
it
alleged
that
the
order
had
been
incorporated,
the
agreement
had
been
incorporated
in
the
order.
the
norfolk
and
western
first
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss.
the
board
filed
an
answer
to
the
district
court.
the
motion
to
dismiss
as
the
district
court
judge
recognized
at
pages
28
and
29
at
the
appendix,
stated
that
jurisdiction
did
not
lie
in
the
district
court
because
the
order
had
not
been
incorporated,
the
agreement
had
not
been
incorporated
in
the
order
and
that
the
parties
were
proceeding
under
the
terms
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
not
under
the
terms
of
the
commission
order.
the
lower
court
overruled
that
contention.
it
held
in
effect
that
under
the
section
5
(2)
(f),
the
parties
were
not
permitted
to
enter
into
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
prior
to
approval
and
it
held
therefore
that
the
agreement
must
me
considered
to
be
part
of
the
commission’s
order
of
approval.
now,
subsequent
to
that
the
n
and
w
filed
an
answer,
and
in
that
answer
it
admitted
the
allegations
of
three
or
four
paragraphs
in
a
single
part
of
his
answer
and
among
the
allegations
admitted
in
that
answer
was
a
conclusion
of
laws
stated
in
the
complaint,
the
effect
that
the
agreement
of
1962
had
been
incorporated
in
the
commission’s
order.
so,
the
n
and
w
at
that
stage
of
the
proceeding
your
honor
was
merely
acknowledging
what
had
already
been
established
as
the
law
of
the
case.
it
did
not
make
any
admission
as
to
what
the
commission
had
done
in
the
premises
and
we
had
merely
abided
by
what
the
district
court
had
already
ruled
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
the
agreement
was
incorporated
in
the
order.
and
of
course,
subsequently,
on
appeal,
we
raised
the
point
again,
and
the
order
did
not
incorporate
the
agreement
which
the
parties
had
made.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
the
commission
your
honor
has
suggested
in
its
brief
in
the
united
states,
the
commission
has
suggested
that
under
section
5
(9)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
under
section
5
(2)
that
it
has
some
responsibility
to
supplement
its
order,
if
it
can
be
shown
that
supplementation
of
its
prior
order
is
necessary
in
order
to
make
the
order
consistent
with
the
public
interest.
so,
i
take
it
that
the
respondent
here
if
they
have
complaint
of
the
adequacy
of
the
protection
in
the
agreement
can
go
back
to
the
commission.
moreover,
the
respondents
here
have
the
right
to
go
to
the
adjustment
board
with
their
individual
complaints
about
what
the
agreements
mean.
the
adjustment
board
does
not
require
presentation
by
the
brotherhood
on
behalf
of
an
individual,
they
can
present
there
own
individual
claims.
and
accordingly
they
go
the
adjustment
board
for
a
determination
as
to
what
their
rights
are
in
premises.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
that
it
what
is
at
the
fact
in
this
situation,
as
what
i
have
in
this
case.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
yes,
i
would
because
of
the
not
withstanding
clause
of
the
--
the
subsequent
agreement,
your
honor,
stands
on
its
own
feet
as
an
independent
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
yes,
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
i
would
agree
to
that.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
yes,
i
think
that
under
the
notwithstanding
clause
of
the
proviso
--
independent
of
the
statute,
i
am
sorry.
i
would
think
so
your
honor
because
of
the
general
principles
regarding
the
authority
of
a
collective
bargaining
representative,
the
collective
bargaining
representative
has
the
authority
to
change
the
terms
of
a
prior
agreement
at
--
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
we
are
contending
for
here
with
respect
to
these
agreements
is
the
reorganization
of
the
traditional
principle
that
the
collective
bargaining
representative,
in
the
absence
of
vaca
versus
sipes
and
doctrine
that
can
do
it,
has
authority
to
bind
the
class
that
it
represents
and
it
may
do
so
even
though
the
terms
differ
from
those
of
the
previously
--
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
there
is
a
possibility
although.
i
think
it
is
quite
unlikely
but
it
has
happened
in
mergers
and
--
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
you
would
not
reach
the
question
your
honor
of
whether
the
subsequent
agreement
change
the
prior
agreement,
i
take
it
unless
it
is
first
determined
that
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
were
correct
in
their
interpretation
of
statute
--
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
i
think
that
if
the
court
arrives
at
that
conclusion
that
and
if
the
issue
could
properly
be
put
to
the
district
court
as
to
what
these
agreements
means
that
there
are
issues
which
are
properly
triable
back
there
as
to
--
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
the
district
court
your
honor
also
left
open
certain
issues
to
be
arbitrated
and
court
of
appeals
held
that
those
issues
should
be
resolved
and
set
by
the
district
court.
so,
there
is
something
remaining
to
be
done
in
the
district
court.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
--
the
court
please,
just
in
reference
to
this
last
case
that
mr.
murray
cited,
beholding
that
court
in
that
case
was
that,
the
arbitration
provisions
governed
that
the
employees
were
required
to
arbitrate
and
could
not
maintain
a
judicial
action
for
the
purpose
of
securing
an
interpretation.
it
was
not
the
provision
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
that
came
into
play
in
that
decision
but
the
fact
that
arbitration
period
in
the
underlying
document
and
that
of
course
is
characteristic
of
the
agreements
which
the
employees
made.
that
is
all
i
have.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
this
is
not
in
anticipation
of
the
argument
in
fact.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
primary
question
presented
by
this
case
involves
section
5
(2)
(f)
in
the
interstate
commerce
act.
initial
provisions
of
that
section
required
interstate
commerce
commission
as
a
prerequisite,
the
approval
of
a
merger
to
impose
protective
conditions
for
the
benefit
of
employees
affected
by
the
transaction.
that
last
sentence
as
an
alternative
to
the
imposition
of
conditions
by
the
commission,
provide
that
not
withstanding
any
other
provisions
of
the
act,
in
agreement
pertaining
to
the
protection
of
employees
maybe
entered
into
by
any
carrier
and
a
duly
authorize
representative
that
with
its
employees.
at
issue
here,
the
relationship
between
the
commission’s
authority
to
impose
protective
conditions
and
the
right
of
representatives,
their
carriers
and
their
employees
to
enter
into
agreements
concerning
that
subject.
the
claims
asserted
by
the
respondents
in
this
case
arise
out
of
the
1964
merger
of
the
nickel
plate,
norfolk
and
western
and
several
other
carriers.
as
a
part
of
that
transaction,
the
norfolk
and
western
required
the
sandusky
line
from
the
pennsylvania
railroad.
the
respondents
were
employed
by
the
pennsylvania
and
worked
on
the
sandusky
line
prior
to
its
sale
to
the
norfolk
and
western.
his
employees
seek
certain
payments
which
they
contend
they
are
entitled
to
under
the
commission’s
order
approving
the
merger.
when
the
n
and
w
sought
commission
approval
of
the
merger
approximately
20
railroad
unions
intervened
in
opposition
and
asked
the
commission
to
impose
protective
conditions
by
the
benefit
of
employees
who
might
be
affected.
following
extensive
negotiations
however,
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen
which
representative
respondents
and
the
other
unions
entered
in
to
an
employee
protection
agreement
with
the
norfolk
and
western
dated
january
10,
1962.
this
agreement
which
we
cited
that
it
was
made
pursuant
to
the
last
sentence
of
section
5(2)(f)
provided
a
type
of
employee
protection
which
differed
significantly
from
that
which
section
5(2)(f)
requires
when
the
commission
imposes
protective
conditions.
and
protective
benefits
are
prescribed
by
the
commission
and
employees
pre-merger
compensation
must
be
protected
for
a
period
of
four
years
or
for
the
number
of
years
of
employment
prior
to
the
merger
whichever
is
less.
there
is
no
guarantee
of
continued
employment
and
the
protection
flows
only
from
the
employing
carrier.
when
the
protective
benefits
are
prescribed
with
the
1962
agreement
however
when
far
beyond
this
type
of
protection
and
constituted
in
effect
a
lifetime
guarantee
of
employment
and
compensation.
initial
paragraph,
the
agreement
provided
that
with
respect
to
nickel

of

provided
the
same
thing
for

section
3
of
the
agreement
covered
the
pennsylvania
employees
on
the
sandusky
line,
they
were
given
an
option
first
to
remain
with
the
pennsylvania
or
to
become
employees
of

section

to
any
such
employee
of
greater

than
such

and
joined

in
the
year
prior
to

the
written
record
of
the
negotiations
with
respect
to
this
agreement
shows
that
the
parties
by
this
proviso
intended
to
make
the
guarantee
for
pennsylvania
employees,
co-extensive
with
there
pre-merger
employment
experience
on
the
sandusky
line.
in
this
respect,
the
protection
provided
by
section
3
differed
somewhat
from
that
provided
by
sections
1
and
2,
under
sections
1
and
2
the
employees
were
protected
on
the
basis
of
their
full
pre-merger
earnings,
by
protection
for
pennsylvania
employees
was
limited
to
their
earnings
from
the
sandusky
line.
the
reason
for
this
difference
lies
in
the
nature
of
the
transaction.
with
respect
to
the
nickel
plate
and
wabash
employees
who
were
covered
by
sections
1
and
2,
the
pennsylvania
or
the
n
and
w
rather
required
the
entire
working
territory
that
these
employees
held
seniority
rights
over.
the
protection
which
the
n
and
w
provided
was
accordingly
based
on
their
pre-merger
employment
without
limitation.
the
pennsylvania
employees
then
on
the
other
hand
who
worked
on
the
sandusky
line,
also
worked
in
other
portions
of
the
pennsylvania
which
were
not
acquired
by
the
n
and
w.
operations
on
the
sandusky
line
or
maine
by
employees
of
the
pennsylvania
who
had
seniority
right
over
the
entire
toledo
division.
sandusky
line
was
a
only
part
of
the
toledo
division.
these
employees
worked
part
of
the
time
on
the
sandusky
line
and
part
of
the
time
another
portions
of
the
toledo
division.
when
the
n
and
w
acquired
the
sandusky
line
it
thus
acquired
only
a
portion
of
the
working
territory
of
these
employees
and
it
offered
protection
limited
to
the
portion
of
the
territory
acquired.
this
type
of
protection
was
intended
primarily
to
discourage
an
excessive
transfer
of
pennsylvania
employees
to
the
n
and
w
pursuant
to
the
option
which
i
have
already
referred
to.
if
a
transfer
appeared
attractive
only
to
those
with
full
time
earnings
on
the
sandusky
line,
it
was
assumed
that
a
sufficient
number
of
employees
would
remain
with
the
pennsylvania
to
permit
it,
to
man
its
operation
on
the
remaining
portions
of
the
toledo
division
and
that
the
number
electing
employment
with
the
n
and
w
would
be
fairly
consistent
with
the
operational
need
down
the
acquired
line.
despite
this
purpose
some
employee
with
limited
earnings
on
the
sandusky
line
did
elect
to
become
n
and
w
employees.
the
respondent
in
this
situation,
in
this
case
rather,
illustrate
the
situation.
prior
to
the
merger,
the
respondents
here
worked
primarily
on
other
portions
of
the
toledo
division
spending
only
very
limited
time
on
the
sandusky
line.
they
nevertheless
chose
to
abandon
their
former
working
territory
and
to
limit
themselves
to
the
sandusky
line,
which
had
provided
only
minimal
work
opportunities
for
them.
had
these
employees
remained
with
the
pennsylvania,
it
is
unlikely
that
the
sale
of
the
sandusky
line
would
have
any
appreciable
effect
on
their
earnings.
to
return
to
the
chronology
events,
the
commission
approved
the
merger
in
1964.
its
report
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
employee
representatives
in
the
n
and
w
had
entered
into
an
agreement
pertaining
to
employee
protection
and
as
to
such
employees
the
commission
found
that
in
view
of
the
agreement,
no
conditions
be
imposed
for
the
protection
of
those
employees
covered
by
such
agreements.
now,
with
respect
to
employees
not
covered
by
the
agreement,
the
commission
did
prescribe
and
imposed
in
its
order
of
approval
the
traditional
for
your
income
protection
with
section
5
2
f
requires
in
those
circumstances.
the
approved
transactions
were
consummated
in
october
1964.
during
the
month
immediately
following
the
n
and
w
and
the
brotherhood
attempted
to
compute
protective
benefit
due
to
the
sandusky
line
employees.
the
n
and
w
was
able
to
obtain
from
the
pennsylvania
earnings
data
pertaining
only
to
total
earnings
over
the
toledo
division.
it
was
unable
to
obtain
in
the
initial
stages
following
the
merger,
a
break
down
showing
wages
earned
on
the
sandusky
line
alone.
it
was
consequently
impossible
on
basis
of
that
data
to
determine
the
benefits
due
to
employees
under
section
3.
accordingly,
an
implementing
agreement
and
a
letter
of
understanding
were
entered
into.
the
letter
of
understanding
provided
for
monetary
payments
which
met
the
immediate
needs
of
the
employees,
while
the
implementing
agreement
contained
a
very
detailed
formula
with
respect
to
the
calculation
of
benefits.
the
agreement
very
expressly
provided
that
such
benefits
were
to
be
determined
by
taking
the
total
compensation
received
by
the
affected
employees
for
service
performed
on
the
sandusky
line
in
12
months
prior
to
merger
and
dividing
by
12.
following
this
disposition
of
the
matter
several
of
the
employees,
former
pennsylvania
employees,
complained
to
their
union
officials
that
implementing
agreement
1a
and
the
letter
of
understanding
did
not
provide
the
payment
that
they
were
entitled
to
under
the
1962
agreement.
these
employees
contented
that
the
1962
agreement
protected
entire
earnings
over
the
entire
toledo
division
that
implementing
agreement
1a
gave
them
something
less.
the
brotherhood
officials,
who
had
negotiated
these
agreement,
advised
the
complaining
employees
that
their
interpretation
of
the
1962
agreement
was
wrong
and
that
implementing
agreement
1a
as
fully
consistent
with
the
1962
agreement.
the
complaining
employees
were
then
afforded
to
full
hearing
before
the
brotherhood
of
national
board
of
appeals
where
their
position
was
fully
presented
and
thoroughly
considered.
the
employees
also
urged
before
the
board
that
the
question
of
the
meaning
of
the
1962
agreement
at
relationship
to
the
implementing
agreement
1a
should
be
taken
to
arbitration
and
as
provided
by
the
agreement.
the
brotherhood's
national
board
of
appeals,
is
very
highest
appellate
body
concluded
that
the
position
taken
by
the
employees
was
without
merit
and
that
implementing
agreement
1a
was
entirely
consistent
with
the
1962
agreement.
the
board
also
did
conclude
that
there
was
no
disagreement
between
brotherhood
and
the
n
and
w
as
to
the
meaning
of
these
agreements
and
it
consequently
inclined
to
invoke
arbitration.
employees
then
instituted
the
present
action
under
section
9
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
under
theory
that
the
n
and
w
had
acted
contrary
to
the
1962
agreement,
that
the
commission
had
incorporated
the
1962
agreement
in
to
its
order,
that
the
n
and
w
had
therefore
violated
an
order
of
interstate
commerce
commission.
the
n
and
w
moved
for
dismissal
in
summary
judgment
under
ground,
one,
that
the
court
was
without
jurisdiction
since
the
action
was
going
to
enforce
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
not
an
order
of
the
commission.
two,
the
arbitration
procedures
of
the
1962
agreement
were
alternatively
the
process
of
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
provided
exclusive
remedies
and
three,
that
implementing
agreement
1a
governed
the
rights
of
the
employees
in
this
matter.
district
court
denied
these
motions
but
granted
a
cross
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
issued
to
declaratory
judgment
upholding
the
1962
agreement
interpretation
for
which
the
respondents
contended.
the
court
of
appeal
deferred
holding
that
under
section
5
(2)
(f),
the
commission
must
prescribe
protection
for
affected
employees
whether
or
not
a
prior
agreement
on
this
subject
has
been
made.
the
court
acknowledged
the
commission
had
expressly
disclaimed
any
intent
or
obligation
to
prescribe
protective
conditions
but
it
held
that
the
commission
order
must
nevertheless
be
construed
to
impose
the
provisions
of
the
1962
agreement,
because
of
the
court’s
view
of
the
meaning
of
the
section
5
(2)
(f).
the
court
accordingly
concluded
that
the
right
set
forth
in
the
1962
agreement
were
incorporated
in
the
1964
order
and
for
purposes
of
federal
court
jurisdiction
stand
from
such
order.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
had
just
described
to
the
holdings
of
the
courts
below.
i
should
now
like
to
discuss
the
respects
in
which
we
can
consider
those
decisions
to
be
wrong.
the
basic
and
primary
error
of
the
decisions
below
concerns
the
conclusion
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
as
required
by
section
5
(2)
(f)
of
the
act
to
prescribe
protection
for
employees
despite
the
existence
of
a
prior
collective
bargaining
agreement
on
this
subject.
in
terms
of
the
act,
its
legislative
history,
it
clearly
show
that
congress
intended
to
preserve
for
the
parties
to
a
merger,
the
right
to
resolve
employee
protection
problems
reflect
to
bargaining
and
that
an
agreement
on
the
subject
was
to
be
a
self
sustaining
alternative
to
the
prescription
of
conditions
by
the
commission.
this
is
apparent
both
in
the
terms
of
the
act
and
its
legislative
history.
respect
to
the
letter
structure
of
the
act,
the
first
two
sentences
require
the
commission
as
a
part
of
its
approval
of
a
covered
transaction
to
prescribe
conditions
for
the
benefit
of
affected
employees.
the
last
sentence
specifically
provide
that
not
withstanding
any
other
provision
of
the
act,
representatives
of
the
carrier
and
there
employees
may
enter
into
agreements
pertaining
to
protection
of
employee.
the
only
possible
reason
for
the
inclusion
of
this
not
withstanding
language
was
to
ensure
that
nothing
in
the
act
would
be
construed
to
limit
the
right
to
make
agreements
and
to
require
any
questions
in
this
regard
to
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
party's
right
to
make
collective
bargaining
agreements
pertaining
to
employee
protection.
the
only
provisions
of
the
act
which
relates
in
any
way
to
employee
protection
are
the
provisions
section
5
(2)
(f).
the
first
two
sentences
of
that
section
are
thus
the
only
possible
source
of
restrictions
on
the
party's
rights
to
agree
to
employee
protection
would
seem
indisputable
therefore
that
the
notwithstanding
clause
of
section
5
(2)
(f)
eliminates
any
restrictions
on
the
collective
bargaining
process
which
might
otherwise
be
inferred
from
the
first
two
sentences
relating
to
the
commission's
authority
and
obligations
in
the
premises.
this
apparent
literal
meaning
is
amply
confirmed
by
the
legislative
history
of
the
section.
this
history
shows
that
section
5
was
the
results
of
an
agreement
between
labor
and
management
that
congress
enacted
the
substantive
provisions
upon
which
the
parties
agreed.
the
labor
spokesman
for
the
sponsoring
group
stated
at
the
so
called
washington
job
protection
agreement
provided
a
suitable
protection
in
the
event
of
a
merger
and
that
labor
would
not
be
seeking
legislation
on
the
subject
at
all,
were
not
for
the
fact
that
approximately
15%
of
the
railroads
were
not
parties
to
the
agreement.
this
spokesman
said
that
if
we
could
get
all
of
the
roads
into
the
agreement,
we
would
not
even
suggest
protection
as
a
matter
of
law.
thus
the
requirement
that
the
commission
imposed
protection
for
employees
was
intended
to
be
operative
only
in
the
event
that
a
voluntary
agreement
had
not
been
reached
on
this
subject
prior
to
commission
approval.
the
principle
congressional
spokesmen
supporting
this
legislation
stated
the
purpose
of
the
section
as
follows
and
i
quote.
“he
proposed
labor
clause,
set-up
specifics
standard
for
the
commission
to
follow.
but
this
provision
also
contained
a
clause
that
permits
the
industry
through
the
processes
of
the
collective
bargaining,
to
work
out
its
problems
in
a
democratic
manner.”
the
congressmen
primarily
involved
in
the
passage
section
5
(2)
(f)
thus
clearly
expressed
the
view
that
the
language
of
section
5
(2)
(f)
provided
standards
for
the
commission
to
follow
but
only
where
the
parties
did
not
resolve
employee
protection
problems
through
a
voluntary
collective
bargaining
agreement.
this
legislative
history
revealed
that
every
group,
that
was
active
in
sponsoring
section
5
(2)
(f)
was
opposed
to
agency
dictated
protection
in
every
merger
and
was
insistent
that
the
process
of
collective
bargaining
be
preserved
as
an
alternative
to
agency
prescription
of
protective
conditions.
despite
this
overwhelming
evidence
of
the
purpose
and
meaning
of
section
5
(2)
(f),
the
courts
below
construed
the
severely
limited
ability
of
unions
and
the
carriers
to
enter
into
agreements
with
respect
to
the
protection
and
to
require
the
commission
to
impose
protection
in
every
instance.
the
decisions
below
effectively
eliminate
the
last
sentence
of
section
5
(2)
(f)
as
an
operative
portion
of
the
statute.
under
these
decisions,
the
commission
is
required
to
review
agreements
relating
to
employee
protection,
to
determine
their
adequacy
and
to
impose
the
terms
and
conditions
which
it
considers
proper.
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
thus
become
nothing
more
than
a
suggestion
to
the
commission
as
to
what
it
might
do
in
the
case
pending
before
it.
if
the
third
sentence
of
section
5
(2)
(f)
were
eliminated
from
the
statute
entirely,
no
one
would
question
the
right
of
labor
and
management
to
enter
into
a
stipulation,
submit
the
stipulation
to
the
commission
suggesting
what
protective
conditions
should
be
imposed.
but
under
the
decision
below
that
is
sole
function
which
is
now
attributable
to
the
last
sentence
of
section
5
(2)
(f),
the
last
sentence
thus
become
a
virtually
meaningless
appendage
to
the
section.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
under
the
decision
below
--.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
my
view
of
the
statute
is
that
if
the
commission
has
entered
an
order
which
imposes
certain
protective
conditions,
the
parties
thereafter,
under
the
last
sentences
of
section
5
(2)
(f),
have
the
right
to
enter
into
an
agreement
--
.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
which
might
be
at
different
terms
in
those
prescribed.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
no.
no
your
honor,
we
do
not
because
in
this
case
the
agreement
upon
which
we
rely
principally
that
the
agreement
that
was
entered
into
prior
to
the
commission’s
order
approval
--
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
this
was
arrived
at
prior
to
the
commission’s
order
of
approval.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
then
we
have
to
convince
you
your
honor
that
under
section
5
(2)
(f)
the
party
subsequent
to
a
merger,
may
collectively
bargain
and
adjust
the
condition
to
suit
what
they
considered
to
be
the
—
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
we
assume
your
honor
that
the
prior
agreement
was
not
incorporated
in
the
commission
authority.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
then
we
need
only
prove
as
i
said
that
under
the
section
5
(2)
(f),
the
parties
have
a
right
to
enter
in
to
such
a
prior
agreement
and
if
any
dispute
arises
as
to
what
the
prior
to
agreement
means
then
there
is
a
process
and
arbitration
and
the
other
administrator
process
is
open
to
determine
that
question.
if
the
prior
agreement
stands
then
your
honor
as
independent
self-sustaining
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
the
party's
right
with
respect
to
are
the
same
with
respect
to
any
other
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
to
the
extent
that
it
provides
for
different
conditions,
it
would,
yes
supersede
the
conditions
imposed—
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
it
is
by
reason
of
the
proviso.
the
proviso
your
honor
relates
both
to
agreements
which
are
made
prior
to
commission
approval
of
a
merger.
and
it
is
also
relates
to
agreement
which
are
made
subsequent
to
commission
approval
of
the
merger.
and
in
both
instances
the
notwithstanding
language
of
that
proviso
is
intended
to
make
it
clear
that
the
parties
may
make
an
agreement
pertaining
to
employee
protection
notwithstanding
the
other
provisions
of
the
act
which
in
effect
means
notwithstanding
the
first
two
sentences
of
that
section.
and
the
first,
two
sentences
of
that
section
are
the
sentences
pursuant
to
which
the
commission
acts
when
it
imposes
protective
conditions.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
there
are
subsequent
agreement
made
your
honor
but
if
the
frequently
happens
that
the
subsequent
agreements
will
implement
or
explain
the
terms
that
fill
in
the
details
that
more
general
provisions
in
the
prior
agreement
and
the
--
so
that
the
process
of
negotiating
with
respect
to
conditions
which
arise
after
the
merger
is
consummated,
is
a
very
vital
and
active
one.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
that
frequently
has
been
the
practice
your
honors.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
that
is
more
generally
the
case
at
least
in
the
last
10
years
than
having
the
commission
prescribe
condition
without
any
prior
agreement
by
the
party.
and
more
general
condition
currently
is
for
the
parties
to
sit
down
and
workout
agreement
pertaining
to
employee
protection
before
the
commission
enters
its
orders.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
the
commission
in
its
report
will
refer
to
those
and
it
did
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
not
in
the
order
of
approval
in
the
form
or
order
of
approval.
but
in
the
report
it
does
set
forth
the
fact
that
the
parties
have
entered
into
an
agreement
and
as
it
does
in
this
case,
it
resides
that
because
the
parties
have
made
an
agreement
pertaining
to
this
subject
there
is
nothing
for
us
to
do
under
section
5
(2)
(f).
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
well,
in
this
case
that
is
right
with
respect
to
employees
covered
by
the
agreement.
that
i
should
add
that
this
additional
detail
that
sometimes
the
agreements
which
are
made
do
not
cover
all
of
the
employees
and
the
commission
in
its
order
of
approval
will
then
impose
terms
and
conditions
where
the
employee
is
not
covered.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
under
the
first
two
sentences.
but
when
an
agreement
has
been
made,
the
invariable
practice
of
the
commission,
and
this
is
discussed
in
detail
in
amicus
brief
which
the
united
states
and
the
commission
has
submitted
in
this
case
your
honor.
in
variable
practice
of
the
commission
where
an
agreement
has
been
made
is
to
recite
that
fact
in
its
report
and
then
to
proceed
to
approve
the
merger
on
the
ground
that
the
agreement
provides
the
protection
required
by
act
and
its
order
need
not
provide
that
protection.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
that
is
undoubtedly
a
situation
your
honor
and
it
permits
the
railroads
and
the
unions
to
workout
into
the
problems
that
are
not
only
directly
relevant
to
employee
protection
but
are
also
relevant
to
other
situations
which
will
arise
in
connection
with
the
merger.
the
great
northern
burlington
merger
for
example
which
is
before
this
court,
the
parties
worked
out
voluminous
agreements,
implementing
the
manner
in
which
the
various
seniority
district
would
be
put
together
on
the
combined
properties,
the
manner
which
trains
would
be
made
and
including
among
the
terms
of
the
agreement
protection
for
employee,
which
is
quite
customary
and
when
these
agreement
are
made
as
they
are
almost
invariably
made
in
current
mergers
for
the
parties
to
workout
problems
of
employee
protection
and
at
the
same
time
to
workout
many
other
labor
relations
problems
that
tended
upon
the
contemplated
merger.
the
whole
thing
fits
together
as
one
bundle
as
it
works.
as
one
of
the
difficulties
of
the
approach
below
that
the
court
looked
at
the
agreements
only
for
this
very
narrow
area
of
whether
it
provides
full
protection
for
four
years
based
on
all
earning
and
it
ignored
all
of
the
other
aspects
of
the
agreement.
and
the
respects
in
which
the
agreement
dealt
with
other
things.
and
dealt
with
them
on
a
very
favorable
basis
as
far
as
the
unions
are
concerned.
one
other
further
point
i
would
like
to
make,
conclusion
is
that
the
lower
court’s
decision
are
also
wrong
because
they
failed
to
give
appropriate
effect
to
this
court’s
holdings
in
republic
steel
versus
maddox
and
in
vaca
versus
sipes
regarding
administrative
remedies
and
the
necessity
of
their
exhaustion
before
judicial
remedies
can
be
invoked.
i
call
the
court's
attention
again
to
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
united
state
and
the
commission
as
discussed
of
the
legislative
history
interstate
commerce
commission’s
interpretation
of
the
statute
and
arrives
at
the
conclusions
which
i
have
stated
with
respect
to
what
section
5
(2)
(f)
mean.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
yes.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
yes,
i
do
your
honor
in
the
district
court,
your
honor,
when
the
complaint
wad
filed
it
alleged
that
the
plaintiff’s
claims
were
based
upon
the
1964
order
of
the
commission.
in
a
number
of
paragraph
it
alleged
that
the
order
had
been
incorporated,
the
agreement
had
been
incorporated
in
the
order.
the
norfolk
and
western
first
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss.
the
board
filed
an
answer
to
the
district
court.
the
motion
to
dismiss
as
the
district
court
judge
recognized
at
pages
28
and
29
at
the
appendix,
stated
that
jurisdiction
did
not
lie
in
the
district
court
because
the
order
had
not
been
incorporated,
the
agreement
had
not
been
incorporated
in
the
order
and
that
the
parties
were
proceeding
under
the
terms
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
not
under
the
terms
of
the
commission
order.
the
lower
court
overruled
that
contention.
it
held
in
effect
that
under
the
section
5
(2)
(f),
the
parties
were
not
permitted
to
enter
into
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
prior
to
approval
and
it
held
therefore
that
the
agreement
must
me
considered
to
be
part
of
the
commission’s
order
of
approval.
now,
subsequent
to
that
the
n
and
w
filed
an
answer,
and
in
that
answer
it
admitted
the
allegations
of
three
or
four
paragraphs
in
a
single
part
of
his
answer
and
among
the
allegations
admitted
in
that
answer
was
a
conclusion
of
laws
stated
in
the
complaint,
the
effect
that
the
agreement
of
1962
had
been
incorporated
in
the
commission’s
order.
so,
the
n
and
w
at
that
stage
of
the
proceeding
your
honor
was
merely
acknowledging
what
had
already
been
established
as
the
law
of
the
case.
it
did
not
make
any
admission
as
to
what
the
commission
had
done
in
the
premises
and
we
had
merely
abided
by
what
the
district
court
had
already
ruled
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
the
agreement
was
incorporated
in
the
order.
and
of
course,
subsequently,
on
appeal,
we
raised
the
point
again,
and
the
order
did
not
incorporate
the
agreement
which
the
parties
had
made.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
the
commission
your
honor
has
suggested
in
its
brief
in
the
united
states,
the
commission
has
suggested
that
under
section
5
(9)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
under
section
5
(2)
that
it
has
some
responsibility
to
supplement
its
order,
if
it
can
be
shown
that
supplementation
of
its
prior
order
is
necessary
in
order
to
make
the
order
consistent
with
the
public
interest.
so,
i
take
it
that
the
respondent
here
if
they
have
complaint
of
the
adequacy
of
the
protection
in
the
agreement
can
go
back
to
the
commission.
moreover,
the
respondents
here
have
the
right
to
go
to
the
adjustment
board
with
their
individual
complaints
about
what
the
agreements
mean.
the
adjustment
board
does
not
require
presentation
by
the
brotherhood
on
behalf
of
an
individual,
they
can
present
there
own
individual
claims.
and
accordingly
they
go
the
adjustment
board
for
a
determination
as
to
what
their
rights
are
in
premises.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
that
it
what
is
at
the
fact
in
this
situation,
as
what
i
have
in
this
case.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
yes,
i
would
because
of
the
not
withstanding
clause
of
the
--
the
subsequent
agreement,
your
honor,
stands
on
its
own
feet
as
an
independent
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
yes,
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
i
would
agree
to
that.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
yes,
i
think
that
under
the
notwithstanding
clause
of
the
proviso
--
independent
of
the
statute,
i
am
sorry.
i
would
think
so
your
honor
because
of
the
general
principles
regarding
the
authority
of
a
collective
bargaining
representative,
the
collective
bargaining
representative
has
the
authority
to
change
the
terms
of
a
prior
agreement
at
--
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
we
are
contending
for
here
with
respect
to
these
agreements
is
the
reorganization
of
the
traditional
principle
that
the
collective
bargaining
representative,
in
the
absence
of
vaca
versus
sipes
and
doctrine
that
can
do
it,
has
authority
to
bind
the
class
that
it
represents
and
it
may
do
so
even
though
the
terms
differ
from
those
of
the
previously
--
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
there
is
a
possibility
although.
i
think
it
is
quite
unlikely
but
it
has
happened
in
mergers
and
--
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
you
would
not
reach
the
question
your
honor
of
whether
the
subsequent
agreement
change
the
prior
agreement,
i
take
it
unless
it
is
first
determined
that
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
were
correct
in
their
interpretation
of
statute
--
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
i
think
that
if
the
court
arrives
at
that
conclusion
that
and
if
the
issue
could
properly
be
put
to
the
district
court
as
to
what
these
agreements
means
that
there
are
issues
which
are
properly
triable
back
there
as
to
--
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
the
district
court
your
honor
also
left
open
certain
issues
to
be
arbitrated
and
court
of
appeals
held
that
those
issues
should
be
resolved
and
set
by
the
district
court.
so,
there
is
something
remaining
to
be
done
in
the
district
court.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
--
the
court
please,
just
in
reference
to
this
last
case
that
mr.
murray
cited,
beholding
that
court
in
that
case
was
that,
the
arbitration
provisions
governed
that
the
employees
were
required
to
arbitrate
and
could
not
maintain
a
judicial
action
for
the
purpose
of
securing
an
interpretation.
it
was
not
the
provision
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
that
came
into
play
in
that
decision
but
the
fact
that
arbitration
period
in
the
underlying
document
and
that
of
course
is
characteristic
of
the
agreements
which
the
employees
made.
that
is
all
i
have.
