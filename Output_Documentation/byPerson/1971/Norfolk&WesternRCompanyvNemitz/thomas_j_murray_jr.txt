mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
respond
immediately
to
the
discussion
concerning
this
post
merger
agreement.
we
submit
that
the
holdings
of
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
are
unequivocal
that
what
the
agreements
themselves
show
is
not
that
the
subsequent
agreement
modified
or
altered
the
protection
given
these
employees
by
the
1962
agreement
but
that
it
abrogated
any
meaningful
protection
that
these
employees
received.
that
was
their
finding
by
simply
reading
the
two
agreements,
the
pre-merger
and
the
subsequent
agreement.
just
how
dramatically
the
two,
the
latter
agreement
modified
that
the
protection
which
we
submit
and
the
courts
found
was
imposed
by
the
commission,
is
i
believe
set
forth
in
some
detail
in
our
brief
at
page
31
and
what
we
conclude
there
in
our
discussion
of
that
portion
of
the
record
is
that
--in
net
effect
what
happened
to
these
men,
three
years
after
the
merger
was
that
they
were
forced
to
payback
the
limited
benefits
which
norfolk
and
western
said
they
were
entitled
to
because
having
had
received
an
unemployment
compensation
during
the
18-month
period
immediately
after
the
merger.
they,
under
the
law,
were
now
receiving
theoretically
at
least
income
through
the
subsequent
agreement.
and
since
the
amounts
that
they
had
received,
in
non-employment
compensation
for
the
most
part
were
not
any
greater
than
they
have
received
by
way
of
these
subsequent
agreements.
they
literally
were
told
that,
now
they
are
back
on
their
feet
and
back
at
work,
they
were
literally
told
they
had
to
repay
this.
i
just
point
this
out
because
it
dramatizes
in
practical,
a
point
of
fact,
how
seriously
the
subsequent
agreements
abrogated
or
nullified
the
protected
features
of
the
pre-merger
agreement.
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not
believe
the
record
as
it
was
at
the
time
the
court
below
entered
summary
judgment
permitted
a
sufficient
development
of
the
facts
in
this
case
quite
candidly
to
permit
a
comment
categorically
as
to
whether
there
was
bad
faith.
i
would
say
this
that
there
was
at
the
very
least,
a
perfunctory
handling
of
the
claims
of
these
small
bands
of
sandusky
men
by
their
union
at
the
very
least,
if
not
bad
faith.
but
that
particular
aspect
of
the
case
did
not
develop
the
question
of
whether
or
not
their
union
impacted-
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
permit
me
to
respond
to
that
question
and
i
hope
responsibly.
we
are
not
here
contending
that
subsequent
to
agreements,
the
unions
and
railroad
can
get
together
and
make
what
is
termed
in
the
industry
implementing
agreements.
quite
the
contrary
we
recognized
the
fact
that
implementing
agreements
are
absolutely
necessary
to
carry-out
the
various
features
of
these
mergers.
our
contention
here
is
and
the
courts
below
held
that
the
very
language
of
the
third
sentence
of
section
5
(2)
(f)
which
says
that
the
agreements
which
pertain
to
the
protection
of
the
interest
of
the
employees
may
be
entered
into
subsequent
to
these
orders
of
approval.
that
this
at
the
very
least
requires
that
all
of
the
protection,
all
of
the
meaningful
protection
given
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
its
order
simply
cannot
be
wiped
out
by
an
agreement
whether
it
is
based
on
bad
faith,
a
mistake.
if
the
court
please,
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
we
submit
did
not
reach
the
question
of
the
motive
behind
the
unions
and
turning
down
the
appeal
of
these
men
when
they
appeal
to
their
national
board
of
appeals.
it
merely
looked
at
the
two
agreements
and
said
this
agreement
takes
away
everything
that
was
given
by
the
agreement
prior
to
the
merger.
and
i
might,
mr.
chief
justice,
add
one
further
point
in
the
same
thing.
the
position
of
these
trainmen
was
that
their
union
temporized
on
their
behalf
and
we
believe
that
if
we
were
permitted
--
had
we
been
permitted
to
develop
the
evidence
in
this
case,
it
would
have
been
that
more
temporization
and
perfunctory
handling
or
lack
of
grasp
about
the
complexities
of
their
claim
on
the
part
of
that
union
hierarchy
which
was
responsible
for
the
fact
that
its
union
did
not
act
on
their
behalf.
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
no,
your
honor
it
would
not.
it
has
been
suggested
and
if
i
may
just
attempt
to
respond
to
that
question,
during
mr.
lucente's
comments,
the
court
referred
to
--
the
mr.
justice
white
asking
the
assuming
that
the
jurisdictional
determination
of
the
court
below
concerning
incorporation
as
accepted
as
fact.
assuming
this
to
be
the
case
what
would
be
the
results?
i
believe,
mr.
justice
blackmun
asked
the
question
of
whether
how
mr.
lucente
would
answer
the
question
of
the
admission
and
the
answer
as
to
to
the
fact
of
incorporation.
we
want
to
meet
this
case
head
on
in
this
court
not
on
any
technical
admissions
in
the
answer.
and
we
want
to
meet
it
head
on
for
two
reasons.
and
we
submit
that
as
an
intensely
practical
matter
unless
the
decisions
of
the
court
below
are
affirmed
on
the
question
of
jurisdiction
employees
who
are
denied
protection
will
have
no
practicable
avenue
of
redress
to
come
back
to
mr.
chief
justice
burger’s
question.
one
suggestion
in
the
brief
of
the
appellee
is
that
employees
in
the
position
of
these
trainmen
could
very
well
sue
their
own
union
for
bad
faith.
that
would
have
been
one
alternative
course
of
action
open
to
them.
and
we
submit
that
this,
as
well
as
the
other
arguable
avenues
are
re-dress
which
have
been
argued
are
utterly
impracticable.
these
men
were
out
of
work,
on
unemployment,
they
were
now
in
a
restructured
union
situation
and
to
suggest
that
men
in
this
position
should
now
have
to
sue
their
own
union,
assuming
that
would
be
even
be
a
viable,
alternative
open
to
them,
should
have
to
sue
their
own
union
and
thereby
in
effect
have
to
pay
their
own
merger
protection
from
the
union
dues
they
were
paying
in,
we
suggest
is
manifestly
contrary
to
the
explicit
intentions
of
section
5
(2)
(f)
and
its
power
--
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
that
is
our
position.
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
that
is
correct
and
if
i
may
respond
just
briefly
further.
i
believe
the
icc
in
a
very
exhaustive
study
of
the
legislative
history
has
placed
its
emphasis
on
the
theory
that
if
the
interstate
commerce
commission
is
not
to
step
aside
and
disavow
any
connection
or
any
obligation
where
they
have
met,
where
the
unions
and
the
railroads
have
agreed
to
conditions,
that
the
result
would
be
encroachment
upon
traditional
collective
bargaining
process.
and
what
we
are
suggesting
here,
attempting
to
suggest
in
out
brief
is
that
the
important
point,
the
important
focus
in
this
type
of
situation
should
not
be
at
the
pre-merger
stage.
but
it
should
be
on
the
question
of
how
the
employee
who
is
actually
caught
up
in
these
mergers
and
in
the
aftermath
stages
is
going
to
enforce
them.
and
here
is
why
we
think
that
it
is
not
only
vital
to
these
employees,
it
is
vital
to
the
railroad
industry
itself
that
as
far
as
the
operation
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
itself,
that
section
511
of
that
act
to
be
given
full
play
in
these
situations
whether
it
is
the
employees
who
come
to
court
saying,
look,
we
have
not
been
for
protected
as
we
were
promised
under
the
agreement
or
whether
it
is
the
railroad.
more
importantly
as
far
as
the
broader
economic
and
social
aspects
of
this
case
are
concerned,
i
would
think
would
be
the
situation
where
the
railroad
comes
in
and
says
we
are
trying
to
get
this
merger
implemented
and
as
happened
in
the
north
western
case.
the
unions
there
took
the
position
that
the
railroad
can
not
put
this
consolidation
into
effect
without
complying
with
the
major
dispute
procedures
of
the
railway
labor
act.
and
in
that
case
the
court
we
think
very
perceptively
held
that
in
facts
exactly
the
facts
as
the
court
found
before,
the
facts
before
the
court
in
this
case,
that
the
only
way
that
you
are
going
to
as
a
practical
matter,
avoid
a
situation
where
the
union
could
hold
a
thread
of
strike
over
the
railroad,
as
a
condition
of
meeting
its
post
merger
conditions
despite
what
the
interstate
commerce
commission
said,
how
its
post
merger
conditions
with
respect
to
the
consolidation
were
going
to
be
carried
out.
the
only
way
you
were
going
to
protect
against
this
threat
would
be
if
you
held
that
the
interstate
commerce
act
applied.
and
in
the
north
western
case,
where
it
was
the
railroad
that
came
into
court
and
said
in
cases
and
in
a
factually
similar
case
to
this
one
where
the
commission
had
simply
acknowledged
the
existence
of
a
prior
agreement
with
respect
to
merger
conditions.
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
as
far
as
jurisdiction
is
concerned
i
feel
we
would
establish
jurisdiction,
yes,
there
would
be
basis
for
jurisdiction.
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
i
would
only
mr.
justice
white
question
the
phrasing
of
that.
we
do
not
question
that
it
can
modify
it.
what
we
are
talking
about
is
can
it
now
--
reduce
it,
yes,
take
away
the
benefit.
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
no,
no
your
honor
we
say
that—
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
we
say
it
may
not
lower
the
benefits.
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
i
would
have
to
say
they
are.
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
well,
we
would
say
your
honor
that
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly,
it
is
our
position
--
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
we
feel
your
honor
that
the
soundest
possible
decision
for
the
railroad
industry
and
for
the
employee
would
be
to
have
this
court
hold
that
the
section
5
(2)
(f)
imposes
an
obligation
on
the
commission
to
assure
whether
through
imposition
or
through
operation
of
law,
a
minimal
level
of
protection
up
to
four
years
compensation
protection,
that
we
feel
--
and
the
reason
i
say
that
is—
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
that
is
correct
and
let
us
assume-
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
i
believe
your
honor
that
the
commission
in
its
brief
as
i
recall
it
took
the
position
that
these
employees
would
be
protected
by
the
fact
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
will
always
come
in
and
supplement
this
order
with
respect
to
benefits,
and
all
the
worst
thing
is
that
is
perfectly
commensurate
with
our
position
but
so
long
as
the
employees
who
are
politically
weakened
or
who
are
pragmatically
weakened
by
these
mergers
have
at
least
the
minimal
protection
because
without
it
they
do
not
have
any
redress.
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
i
would
not
say
that
you
have
to
add
that
we
feel
that—
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
i
believe
this
court
in
two
cases
that
brotherhood
in
the
maine
subway
case
and
the
railway
labor
executive's
case
in
reviewing
this
legislative
history
held
without
getting
to
the
question
of
the
effect
of
the
third
sentence
agreement.
that
the
second
sentence
of
section
5
(2)
(f)
composes
a
mandatory
minimum
duty
on
the
commission
to
impose
four
years
of
compensation
protection.
it
is
so
construed
the
first
and
second
sentences
and
what
we
are
saying
here
is
that
leaving
aside
the
question
of
any
technical
admission
about
incorporation
of
the
agreement,
what
we
are
saying
here
is
that,
unless
at
the
enforcement
stages,
employees
who
are
caught
up
in
the
type
of
situation
these
men
were
caught
up,
have
a
right
to
come
in
to
the
court
and
invoke
the
remedial
scheme
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
which
gives
them
attorney’s
fees,
cost,
unless
they
have
this
practical
means
of
assuring
that
the
protection
promise
them
as
a
condition
of
approval
of
these
mergers.
they
do
not
really
have
any
practicable
avenue
of
redress,
the
other
than
suing
their
own
union
which
has
been
suggested,
the
other
two
alternatives
that
i
believe
have
been
mentioned
are
to
go
to
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board.
this
would
be
a
five-year
process
on
the
average
for
men
who
desperately
need
to
help
now.
now,
that
the
merger
has
dislocated
and
in
this
regard,
i
want
to
point
out
something
that
should
be
stressed
about
the
record
in
this
case.
these
men’s
primary
working
connections
with
the
city
of
sandusky
on
the
average
i
believe
they
had
approximately
10
to
20
years
seniority
at
the
time,
that
this
merger
went
into
effect.
the
year
prior
to
this
merger,
their
opportunities
for
employment
at
sandusky
had
diminished
because
of
the
very
facts
which
gave
a
reason
for
the
merger
to
take
place
in
the
first
place,
so,
you
had
a
declining
volume
of
revenue
and
traffic
at
sandusky.
so,
that
during
that
period
immediately
prior
to
the
merger,
their
work
opportunities
were
limited,
but
these
were
men
that
had
homes
at
sandusky.
and
15
days
before
this
merger
took
place,
they
received
a
notification
that
they
could
uproot
and
go
to
toledo
and
remain
with
pansy
or
they
could
take
employment
with
the
norfolk
and
western
railway
company.
and
in
that
agreement
unequivocally
was
stated
or
attached
to
that
agreement,
i
should
say
was
the
portion
of
the
pre-merger
agreements
which
categorically
stated
that
if
you
take
employment
with
the
norfolk
and
western
railway
company,
you
will
have
your
employment
protected
and
you
will
not
be
placed
in
the
worst
position
with
respect
compensation
at
anytime
during
norfolk
and
western
employment.
we
might
add
here
at
this
point
that
these
men
have
never
claimed
the
full
arguable
scope
of
that
protection.
they
have
never
claimed
that
they
had
a
right
to
a
job
at
sandusky.
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
you
just
read
part
of
section
3
but
attached
to
that
same
agreement
was
a
very
simple
formula
and
which
is
admitted
was
part
of
that
agreement.
and
it
provided
that
the
employee’s
protection
was
to
be
supplemented
to
the
extent
that
it
fell
below
his
average
monthly
compensation.
based
upon
the
last
12
months
in
which
he
performs
service
divided
by
12.
and
it
is
practical
matter
the
only
exposure
of
the
norfolk
and
western
and
sandusky
under
this
pre-merger
agreement
was
during
the
transitional
period
and
this
is
alluded
to
indirectly
by
the
district
court
because
this
particular
merger
protection
agreement
had
a
built
in
a
protection
against
failure
of
the
merger.
if
your
court
may
have
noted
that
there
was
a
proviso
in
there
that
if
the
norfolk
and
western’s
traffic
or
revenues
declined
as
a
result
of
this
merger,
these
employees
will
not
be
protected.
and
all
that
means
is
that
neither
you
have
to
meteor
of
operations,
pennsylvania
is
going
out
of
operation,
the
norfolk
and
western
is
coming
in
and
to
the
extent
that
after
this
merger,
the
norfolk
and
western
business
declined
from
that
point
on,
these
employees
would
not
have
any
protection.
the
only
thing
that
they
are
asking,
they
only
thing
that
they
have
asked
here
is
for
that
simple
compensation
protection
as
a
result
of
being
out
of
the
job
at
sandusky
after
the
merger
and
that
is
the
only
thing
that
they
have
asked.
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
we
would
concede
that,
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
if
the
union
agreed
to
what
norfolk
and
western
claims
they
agreed
here,
it
was
at
least
improvident,
if
not
egregious
and
unfair.
if
you
look
from
their
point
of
view,
these
men
are
out
of
work
and
they
filed
their
claim,
they
are
told,
“you
cannot
be
compensated
for
the
simple
reason
that
we
do
not
have
pennsylvania
earnings
available
so,
wait!”
and
they
wait
a
year,
this
is
what
happened
to
them.
they
wait
a
year
and
the
pressure
builds
up
within
the
union
so
that
their
local
chairman
puts
pressure
on
the
intermediate
run
and
they
go
to
cleveland
and
they
sit
down
and
they
enter
in
to
this
subsequent
agreement
which
we
have
alluded
to
here.
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
all
that
we
would
say
is
that
your
honor,
where
you
have
a
statute
with
the
clear
policy,
underlying
policy
reasons
at
the
interstate
commerce
act
section
5
(2)
(f)
has
--
which
has
a
sole
purpose
of
existence
employee
protection,
to
say
that
for
any
reason
because
of
political
motivation,
because
of
ignorance
of
what
is
in
the
interstate
commerce
acts
or
the
interstate
commission's
order.
if
the
railroads
can
sit
down
with
the
representatives
of
these
employees
who
are
politically
and
practically
disrupted
in
their
lives
by
and
can
simply
abolish
out
of
hand,
the
protection
given
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
which
is
exactly
what
happened
here.
then
in
this
type
of
case,
the
protection
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
is
a
cruel
illusion
and
that
is
what
it
turned
out
to
be
to
these
men.
these
men
ended
up
literally
in
a
worst
position.
these
employees
literally
ended
up
in
a
worst
position
that
if
the
interstate
commerce
act
had
never
been
written
and
then
if
they
had
never
been
promised
anything
under
the
pre-merger
agreements
as
a
practical
matter.
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
no,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
would
submit
that
you
really
do
not,
as
matter
of
fact,
we
feel
that
notwithstanding
clause
is
very
much
--
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
that
is
correct
that
there
is
nothing
really
inconsistent
between
the
third
sentence
of
section
5
(2)
(f)
in
the
first
and
second
sentences.
we
feel
that
all
that
this
boils
down
to
is
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
is
required
to
impose
conditions
where
the
parties
can
agree
upon.
and
where
the
parties
agree
upon
and
the
very
least
that
they
have
to
do
is
make
sure
that
the
employees
who
are
going
to
be
most
drastically
affected
in
their
employment
relationships
receive
the
minimal
level
of
protection.
that
is
all
we
are
saying.
we
have
an
alternative
argument
in
there
that
even
this
court
should
hold
that
notwithstanding
clause
relieves
the
interstate
commerce
commission
of
any
responsibility
whatsoever
with
respect
to
employee
protection
and
at
the
very
least
this
court
should
hold
as
a
practical
matter,
if
you
are
going
to
have
these
mergers
carried
out
at
all,
is
that
at
the
enforcement
stages,
they
have
a
right
to
the
remedial
scheme
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
first
of
all.
and
secondly,
that
their
unions
cannot
sit
down
and
literally
undo
out
of
hand,
protection
afforded
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
or
by
the
agreement
between
the
union
and
the
railroad
at
the
time
that
the
protective
conditions
were
considered
and
agreed
upon.
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
mr.
justice
burger,
may
i
come
back
to
a
point
that
i
tried
to
make
a
moment
ago.
as
a
practical
matter,
it
would
be
far
more
disastrous
for
the
railroad
industry,
if
this
court
should
reverse
the
reasoning
of
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
then
it
would
be
for
the
employees
in
the
position
of
these
plaintiffs,
if
i
may
take
a
moment
to
explain
why.
the
basic
holding
of
this
court,
of
the
courts
below
is
that
section
511
exempts
the
carriers
and
the
railroads
from
the
operation
of
the
railway
labor
act.
these
men
are
coming
here
merely
saying
that
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
they
have
certain
rights
to
protection.
now,
turn
that
around
if
you
would
for
sake
a
hypothetical
illustration.
suppose
that
sandusky,
that
the
employees
had
put
their
foot
down
through
their
unions
and
said
“we
are
not
going
ahead
with
this
merger
until
you
comply
with
the
major
dispute
procedures
of
the
railway
labor
act”.
that
is
we
do
not
like
certain
condition
that
we
agreed
upon
and
we
do
not
like
certain
condition
the
interstate
commerce
commission
imposed
here.
and
before
you
can
go
ahead,
we
will
strike,
if
you
go
ahead
and
change
our
contract.
now,
all
that
we
are
saying
here
is
that
the
same
principles
which
the
court
applied
below,
that
is
if
you
are
going
to
get
these
mergers
in
to
effect
and
efficaciously
provide
employment
for
the
employees,
and
if
you
are
going
to
absolved
the
railroad
from
having
the
unions
hold
a
threat
of
strike
over
their
head,
if
they
do
not
do
something
different
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
order,
as
was
the
case
in
north
western,
you
simply
got
to
reconcile
the
objectives
of
the
railway
labor
act
which
we
concede
require
collective
agreements
on
all
matters
and
the
requirements
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
and
that
is
what
the
court
did.
and
we
suggest
that
there
is
a
real
genius
in
the
decisions
of
the
courts
below,
a
very
great
perception
because
in
effect
it
hires
out
the
disputes
related
to
mergers
and
makes
the
interstate
commerce
act
the
applicable
law
and
obviates
the
risk
of
national
rail
strikes,
in
situations
where
the
unions
do
not
like
what
the
interstate
commerce
commission
requires.
we
feel
that,
if
i
may
say
in
conclusion,
we
feel
that
the
results
to
the
railroad
industry
itself
would
be
far
more
deleterious
and
far
more
adverse,
if
the
decisions
of
the
courts
below
were
reversed,
as
reflected
in
this
most
practical
intensely
practical
aspects
by
the
fact
situation
in
the
north
western
case
upon
which
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
very
heavily
relied.
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
yes,
it
could,
your
honor,
yes
it
could.
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
well,
if
i
may
use
the
phrase
--
the
real
beauty
of
the
decision
below,
because
the
court
held
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
not
the
railway
labor
act
applies
--
if
may
call
your
attention
mr.
justice
stewart
to
49
us
section
511
which
exempts
the
carriers
and
the
employees
from
the
operation
of
the
railway
labor
act.
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
and
as
it
was
done
in
the
north
western,
they
threatened
a
strike
and
if
i
may
say
just
in
conclusion,
i
lost
the
case
in
the
northern
district
of
ohio,
three-and-a-half
weeks
ago
where
the
railroad
and
norfolk
and
western
came
in
and
rely
on
this
very
decision.
the
nemitz
case
and
i
may
take
just
a
moment
to
give
mr.
justice
stewart
the
facts
of
that
case.
the
railroad
attempted
to
change
the
merger
benefits,
to
adjust
them
downward
as
a
result
of
the
hours
of
service
act
amendments
which
limit
the
number
of
hours
an
employee
can
work.
and
the
union
took
a
national
strike
ballot
and
they
asked
me
to
take
the
case
to
court
and
i
knew
this
nemitz
case
was
here
and
i
knew
we
are
gong
to
meet
it
and
we
did
and
we
lost.
and
we
lost
because
the
court
said
that
the
law
that
applies
here
is
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
the
nemitz
decision
and
the
rationale
of
the
nemitz
in
north
western
decisions
literally,
in
that
case
in
c
70-145
that
will
be
recorded
in
the
federal
supplement,
that
case
literally
removed
the
risk
of
the
national
railroad
strike
and
it
is
give
an
expeditious
avenue
of
determination
of
disputes
which
arise
in
the
aftermath
of
these
complicated
rail
consolidation
which
are
bound
to
create
disputes
out
of
confusion
or
ignorance
or
whatever
as
was
done
this
case,
and
in
this
case
it
just
happened
to
be
that
the
victims
of
the
confusion
were
the
employees,
it
could
very
well
up
in
the
railroad,
the
railroads
themselves.
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
respond
immediately
to
the
discussion
concerning
this
post
merger
agreement.
we
submit
that
the
holdings
of
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
are
unequivocal
that
what
the
agreements
themselves
show
is
not
that
the
subsequent
agreement
modified
or
altered
the
protection
given
these
employees
by
the
1962
agreement
but
that
it
abrogated
any
meaningful
protection
that
these
employees
received.
that
was
their
finding
by
simply
reading
the
two
agreements,
the
pre-merger
and
the
subsequent
agreement.
just
how
dramatically
the
two,
the
latter
agreement
modified
that
the
protection
which
we
submit
and
the
courts
found
was
imposed
by
the
commission,
is
i
believe
set
forth
in
some
detail
in
our
brief
at
page
31
and
what
we
conclude
there
in
our
discussion
of
that
portion
of
the
record
is
that
--in
net
effect
what
happened
to
these
men,
three
years
after
the
merger
was
that
they
were
forced
to
payback
the
limited
benefits
which
norfolk
and
western
said
they
were
entitled
to
because
having
had
received
an
unemployment
compensation
during
the
18-month
period
immediately
after
the
merger.
they,
under
the
law,
were
now
receiving
theoretically
at
least
income
through
the
subsequent
agreement.
and
since
the
amounts
that
they
had
received,
in
non-employment
compensation
for
the
most
part
were
not
any
greater
than
they
have
received
by
way
of
these
subsequent
agreements.
they
literally
were
told
that,
now
they
are
back
on
their
feet
and
back
at
work,
they
were
literally
told
they
had
to
repay
this.
i
just
point
this
out
because
it
dramatizes
in
practical,
a
point
of
fact,
how
seriously
the
subsequent
agreements
abrogated
or
nullified
the
protected
features
of
the
pre-merger
agreement.
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not
believe
the
record
as
it
was
at
the
time
the
court
below
entered
summary
judgment
permitted
a
sufficient
development
of
the
facts
in
this
case
quite
candidly
to
permit
a
comment
categorically
as
to
whether
there
was
bad
faith.
i
would
say
this
that
there
was
at
the
very
least,
a
perfunctory
handling
of
the
claims
of
these
small
bands
of
sandusky
men
by
their
union
at
the
very
least,
if
not
bad
faith.
but
that
particular
aspect
of
the
case
did
not
develop
the
question
of
whether
or
not
their
union
impacted-
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
permit
me
to
respond
to
that
question
and
i
hope
responsibly.
we
are
not
here
contending
that
subsequent
to
agreements,
the
unions
and
railroad
can
get
together
and
make
what
is
termed
in
the
industry
implementing
agreements.
quite
the
contrary
we
recognized
the
fact
that
implementing
agreements
are
absolutely
necessary
to
carry-out
the
various
features
of
these
mergers.
our
contention
here
is
and
the
courts
below
held
that
the
very
language
of
the
third
sentence
of
section
5
(2)
(f)
which
says
that
the
agreements
which
pertain
to
the
protection
of
the
interest
of
the
employees
may
be
entered
into
subsequent
to
these
orders
of
approval.
that
this
at
the
very
least
requires
that
all
of
the
protection,
all
of
the
meaningful
protection
given
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
its
order
simply
cannot
be
wiped
out
by
an
agreement
whether
it
is
based
on
bad
faith,
a
mistake.
if
the
court
please,
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
we
submit
did
not
reach
the
question
of
the
motive
behind
the
unions
and
turning
down
the
appeal
of
these
men
when
they
appeal
to
their
national
board
of
appeals.
it
merely
looked
at
the
two
agreements
and
said
this
agreement
takes
away
everything
that
was
given
by
the
agreement
prior
to
the
merger.
and
i
might,
mr.
chief
justice,
add
one
further
point
in
the
same
thing.
the
position
of
these
trainmen
was
that
their
union
temporized
on
their
behalf
and
we
believe
that
if
we
were
permitted
--
had
we
been
permitted
to
develop
the
evidence
in
this
case,
it
would
have
been
that
more
temporization
and
perfunctory
handling
or
lack
of
grasp
about
the
complexities
of
their
claim
on
the
part
of
that
union
hierarchy
which
was
responsible
for
the
fact
that
its
union
did
not
act
on
their
behalf.
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
no,
your
honor
it
would
not.
it
has
been
suggested
and
if
i
may
just
attempt
to
respond
to
that
question,
during
mr.
lucente's
comments,
the
court
referred
to
--
the
mr.
justice
white
asking
the
assuming
that
the
jurisdictional
determination
of
the
court
below
concerning
incorporation
as
accepted
as
fact.
assuming
this
to
be
the
case
what
would
be
the
results?
i
believe,
mr.
justice
blackmun
asked
the
question
of
whether
how
mr.
lucente
would
answer
the
question
of
the
admission
and
the
answer
as
to
to
the
fact
of
incorporation.
we
want
to
meet
this
case
head
on
in
this
court
not
on
any
technical
admissions
in
the
answer.
and
we
want
to
meet
it
head
on
for
two
reasons.
and
we
submit
that
as
an
intensely
practical
matter
unless
the
decisions
of
the
court
below
are
affirmed
on
the
question
of
jurisdiction
employees
who
are
denied
protection
will
have
no
practicable
avenue
of
redress
to
come
back
to
mr.
chief
justice
burger’s
question.
one
suggestion
in
the
brief
of
the
appellee
is
that
employees
in
the
position
of
these
trainmen
could
very
well
sue
their
own
union
for
bad
faith.
that
would
have
been
one
alternative
course
of
action
open
to
them.
and
we
submit
that
this,
as
well
as
the
other
arguable
avenues
are
re-dress
which
have
been
argued
are
utterly
impracticable.
these
men
were
out
of
work,
on
unemployment,
they
were
now
in
a
restructured
union
situation
and
to
suggest
that
men
in
this
position
should
now
have
to
sue
their
own
union,
assuming
that
would
be
even
be
a
viable,
alternative
open
to
them,
should
have
to
sue
their
own
union
and
thereby
in
effect
have
to
pay
their
own
merger
protection
from
the
union
dues
they
were
paying
in,
we
suggest
is
manifestly
contrary
to
the
explicit
intentions
of
section
5
(2)
(f)
and
its
power
--
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
that
is
our
position.
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
that
is
correct
and
if
i
may
respond
just
briefly
further.
i
believe
the
icc
in
a
very
exhaustive
study
of
the
legislative
history
has
placed
its
emphasis
on
the
theory
that
if
the
interstate
commerce
commission
is
not
to
step
aside
and
disavow
any
connection
or
any
obligation
where
they
have
met,
where
the
unions
and
the
railroads
have
agreed
to
conditions,
that
the
result
would
be
encroachment
upon
traditional
collective
bargaining
process.
and
what
we
are
suggesting
here,
attempting
to
suggest
in
out
brief
is
that
the
important
point,
the
important
focus
in
this
type
of
situation
should
not
be
at
the
pre-merger
stage.
but
it
should
be
on
the
question
of
how
the
employee
who
is
actually
caught
up
in
these
mergers
and
in
the
aftermath
stages
is
going
to
enforce
them.
and
here
is
why
we
think
that
it
is
not
only
vital
to
these
employees,
it
is
vital
to
the
railroad
industry
itself
that
as
far
as
the
operation
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
itself,
that
section
511
of
that
act
to
be
given
full
play
in
these
situations
whether
it
is
the
employees
who
come
to
court
saying,
look,
we
have
not
been
for
protected
as
we
were
promised
under
the
agreement
or
whether
it
is
the
railroad.
more
importantly
as
far
as
the
broader
economic
and
social
aspects
of
this
case
are
concerned,
i
would
think
would
be
the
situation
where
the
railroad
comes
in
and
says
we
are
trying
to
get
this
merger
implemented
and
as
happened
in
the
north
western
case.
the
unions
there
took
the
position
that
the
railroad
can
not
put
this
consolidation
into
effect
without
complying
with
the
major
dispute
procedures
of
the
railway
labor
act.
and
in
that
case
the
court
we
think
very
perceptively
held
that
in
facts
exactly
the
facts
as
the
court
found
before,
the
facts
before
the
court
in
this
case,
that
the
only
way
that
you
are
going
to
as
a
practical
matter,
avoid
a
situation
where
the
union
could
hold
a
thread
of
strike
over
the
railroad,
as
a
condition
of
meeting
its
post
merger
conditions
despite
what
the
interstate
commerce
commission
said,
how
its
post
merger
conditions
with
respect
to
the
consolidation
were
going
to
be
carried
out.
the
only
way
you
were
going
to
protect
against
this
threat
would
be
if
you
held
that
the
interstate
commerce
act
applied.
and
in
the
north
western
case,
where
it
was
the
railroad
that
came
into
court
and
said
in
cases
and
in
a
factually
similar
case
to
this
one
where
the
commission
had
simply
acknowledged
the
existence
of
a
prior
agreement
with
respect
to
merger
conditions.
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
as
far
as
jurisdiction
is
concerned
i
feel
we
would
establish
jurisdiction,
yes,
there
would
be
basis
for
jurisdiction.
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
i
would
only
mr.
justice
white
question
the
phrasing
of
that.
we
do
not
question
that
it
can
modify
it.
what
we
are
talking
about
is
can
it
now
--
reduce
it,
yes,
take
away
the
benefit.
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
no,
no
your
honor
we
say
that—
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
we
say
it
may
not
lower
the
benefits.
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
i
would
have
to
say
they
are.
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
well,
we
would
say
your
honor
that
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly,
it
is
our
position
--
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
we
feel
your
honor
that
the
soundest
possible
decision
for
the
railroad
industry
and
for
the
employee
would
be
to
have
this
court
hold
that
the
section
5
(2)
(f)
imposes
an
obligation
on
the
commission
to
assure
whether
through
imposition
or
through
operation
of
law,
a
minimal
level
of
protection
up
to
four
years
compensation
protection,
that
we
feel
--
and
the
reason
i
say
that
is—
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
that
is
correct
and
let
us
assume-
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
i
believe
your
honor
that
the
commission
in
its
brief
as
i
recall
it
took
the
position
that
these
employees
would
be
protected
by
the
fact
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
will
always
come
in
and
supplement
this
order
with
respect
to
benefits,
and
all
the
worst
thing
is
that
is
perfectly
commensurate
with
our
position
but
so
long
as
the
employees
who
are
politically
weakened
or
who
are
pragmatically
weakened
by
these
mergers
have
at
least
the
minimal
protection
because
without
it
they
do
not
have
any
redress.
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
i
would
not
say
that
you
have
to
add
that
we
feel
that—
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
i
believe
this
court
in
two
cases
that
brotherhood
in
the
maine
subway
case
and
the
railway
labor
executive's
case
in
reviewing
this
legislative
history
held
without
getting
to
the
question
of
the
effect
of
the
third
sentence
agreement.
that
the
second
sentence
of
section
5
(2)
(f)
composes
a
mandatory
minimum
duty
on
the
commission
to
impose
four
years
of
compensation
protection.
it
is
so
construed
the
first
and
second
sentences
and
what
we
are
saying
here
is
that
leaving
aside
the
question
of
any
technical
admission
about
incorporation
of
the
agreement,
what
we
are
saying
here
is
that,
unless
at
the
enforcement
stages,
employees
who
are
caught
up
in
the
type
of
situation
these
men
were
caught
up,
have
a
right
to
come
in
to
the
court
and
invoke
the
remedial
scheme
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
which
gives
them
attorney’s
fees,
cost,
unless
they
have
this
practical
means
of
assuring
that
the
protection
promise
them
as
a
condition
of
approval
of
these
mergers.
they
do
not
really
have
any
practicable
avenue
of
redress,
the
other
than
suing
their
own
union
which
has
been
suggested,
the
other
two
alternatives
that
i
believe
have
been
mentioned
are
to
go
to
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board.
this
would
be
a
five-year
process
on
the
average
for
men
who
desperately
need
to
help
now.
now,
that
the
merger
has
dislocated
and
in
this
regard,
i
want
to
point
out
something
that
should
be
stressed
about
the
record
in
this
case.
these
men’s
primary
working
connections
with
the
city
of
sandusky
on
the
average
i
believe
they
had
approximately
10
to
20
years
seniority
at
the
time,
that
this
merger
went
into
effect.
the
year
prior
to
this
merger,
their
opportunities
for
employment
at
sandusky
had
diminished
because
of
the
very
facts
which
gave
a
reason
for
the
merger
to
take
place
in
the
first
place,
so,
you
had
a
declining
volume
of
revenue
and
traffic
at
sandusky.
so,
that
during
that
period
immediately
prior
to
the
merger,
their
work
opportunities
were
limited,
but
these
were
men
that
had
homes
at
sandusky.
and
15
days
before
this
merger
took
place,
they
received
a
notification
that
they
could
uproot
and
go
to
toledo
and
remain
with
pansy
or
they
could
take
employment
with
the
norfolk
and
western
railway
company.
and
in
that
agreement
unequivocally
was
stated
or
attached
to
that
agreement,
i
should
say
was
the
portion
of
the
pre-merger
agreements
which
categorically
stated
that
if
you
take
employment
with
the
norfolk
and
western
railway
company,
you
will
have
your
employment
protected
and
you
will
not
be
placed
in
the
worst
position
with
respect
compensation
at
anytime
during
norfolk
and
western
employment.
we
might
add
here
at
this
point
that
these
men
have
never
claimed
the
full
arguable
scope
of
that
protection.
they
have
never
claimed
that
they
had
a
right
to
a
job
at
sandusky.
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
you
just
read
part
of
section
3
but
attached
to
that
same
agreement
was
a
very
simple
formula
and
which
is
admitted
was
part
of
that
agreement.
and
it
provided
that
the
employee’s
protection
was
to
be
supplemented
to
the
extent
that
it
fell
below
his
average
monthly
compensation.
based
upon
the
last
12
months
in
which
he
performs
service
divided
by
12.
and
it
is
practical
matter
the
only
exposure
of
the
norfolk
and
western
and
sandusky
under
this
pre-merger
agreement
was
during
the
transitional
period
and
this
is
alluded
to
indirectly
by
the
district
court
because
this
particular
merger
protection
agreement
had
a
built
in
a
protection
against
failure
of
the
merger.
if
your
court
may
have
noted
that
there
was
a
proviso
in
there
that
if
the
norfolk
and
western’s
traffic
or
revenues
declined
as
a
result
of
this
merger,
these
employees
will
not
be
protected.
and
all
that
means
is
that
neither
you
have
to
meteor
of
operations,
pennsylvania
is
going
out
of
operation,
the
norfolk
and
western
is
coming
in
and
to
the
extent
that
after
this
merger,
the
norfolk
and
western
business
declined
from
that
point
on,
these
employees
would
not
have
any
protection.
the
only
thing
that
they
are
asking,
they
only
thing
that
they
have
asked
here
is
for
that
simple
compensation
protection
as
a
result
of
being
out
of
the
job
at
sandusky
after
the
merger
and
that
is
the
only
thing
that
they
have
asked.
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
we
would
concede
that,
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
if
the
union
agreed
to
what
norfolk
and
western
claims
they
agreed
here,
it
was
at
least
improvident,
if
not
egregious
and
unfair.
if
you
look
from
their
point
of
view,
these
men
are
out
of
work
and
they
filed
their
claim,
they
are
told,
“you
cannot
be
compensated
for
the
simple
reason
that
we
do
not
have
pennsylvania
earnings
available
so,
wait!”
and
they
wait
a
year,
this
is
what
happened
to
them.
they
wait
a
year
and
the
pressure
builds
up
within
the
union
so
that
their
local
chairman
puts
pressure
on
the
intermediate
run
and
they
go
to
cleveland
and
they
sit
down
and
they
enter
in
to
this
subsequent
agreement
which
we
have
alluded
to
here.
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
all
that
we
would
say
is
that
your
honor,
where
you
have
a
statute
with
the
clear
policy,
underlying
policy
reasons
at
the
interstate
commerce
act
section
5
(2)
(f)
has
--
which
has
a
sole
purpose
of
existence
employee
protection,
to
say
that
for
any
reason
because
of
political
motivation,
because
of
ignorance
of
what
is
in
the
interstate
commerce
acts
or
the
interstate
commission's
order.
if
the
railroads
can
sit
down
with
the
representatives
of
these
employees
who
are
politically
and
practically
disrupted
in
their
lives
by
and
can
simply
abolish
out
of
hand,
the
protection
given
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
which
is
exactly
what
happened
here.
then
in
this
type
of
case,
the
protection
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
is
a
cruel
illusion
and
that
is
what
it
turned
out
to
be
to
these
men.
these
men
ended
up
literally
in
a
worst
position.
these
employees
literally
ended
up
in
a
worst
position
that
if
the
interstate
commerce
act
had
never
been
written
and
then
if
they
had
never
been
promised
anything
under
the
pre-merger
agreements
as
a
practical
matter.
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
no,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
would
submit
that
you
really
do
not,
as
matter
of
fact,
we
feel
that
notwithstanding
clause
is
very
much
--
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
that
is
correct
that
there
is
nothing
really
inconsistent
between
the
third
sentence
of
section
5
(2)
(f)
in
the
first
and
second
sentences.
we
feel
that
all
that
this
boils
down
to
is
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
is
required
to
impose
conditions
where
the
parties
can
agree
upon.
and
where
the
parties
agree
upon
and
the
very
least
that
they
have
to
do
is
make
sure
that
the
employees
who
are
going
to
be
most
drastically
affected
in
their
employment
relationships
receive
the
minimal
level
of
protection.
that
is
all
we
are
saying.
we
have
an
alternative
argument
in
there
that
even
this
court
should
hold
that
notwithstanding
clause
relieves
the
interstate
commerce
commission
of
any
responsibility
whatsoever
with
respect
to
employee
protection
and
at
the
very
least
this
court
should
hold
as
a
practical
matter,
if
you
are
going
to
have
these
mergers
carried
out
at
all,
is
that
at
the
enforcement
stages,
they
have
a
right
to
the
remedial
scheme
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
first
of
all.
and
secondly,
that
their
unions
cannot
sit
down
and
literally
undo
out
of
hand,
protection
afforded
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
or
by
the
agreement
between
the
union
and
the
railroad
at
the
time
that
the
protective
conditions
were
considered
and
agreed
upon.
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
mr.
justice
burger,
may
i
come
back
to
a
point
that
i
tried
to
make
a
moment
ago.
as
a
practical
matter,
it
would
be
far
more
disastrous
for
the
railroad
industry,
if
this
court
should
reverse
the
reasoning
of
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
then
it
would
be
for
the
employees
in
the
position
of
these
plaintiffs,
if
i
may
take
a
moment
to
explain
why.
the
basic
holding
of
this
court,
of
the
courts
below
is
that
section
511
exempts
the
carriers
and
the
railroads
from
the
operation
of
the
railway
labor
act.
these
men
are
coming
here
merely
saying
that
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
they
have
certain
rights
to
protection.
now,
turn
that
around
if
you
would
for
sake
a
hypothetical
illustration.
suppose
that
sandusky,
that
the
employees
had
put
their
foot
down
through
their
unions
and
said
“we
are
not
going
ahead
with
this
merger
until
you
comply
with
the
major
dispute
procedures
of
the
railway
labor
act”.
that
is
we
do
not
like
certain
condition
that
we
agreed
upon
and
we
do
not
like
certain
condition
the
interstate
commerce
commission
imposed
here.
and
before
you
can
go
ahead,
we
will
strike,
if
you
go
ahead
and
change
our
contract.
now,
all
that
we
are
saying
here
is
that
the
same
principles
which
the
court
applied
below,
that
is
if
you
are
going
to
get
these
mergers
in
to
effect
and
efficaciously
provide
employment
for
the
employees,
and
if
you
are
going
to
absolved
the
railroad
from
having
the
unions
hold
a
threat
of
strike
over
their
head,
if
they
do
not
do
something
different
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
order,
as
was
the
case
in
north
western,
you
simply
got
to
reconcile
the
objectives
of
the
railway
labor
act
which
we
concede
require
collective
agreements
on
all
matters
and
the
requirements
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
and
that
is
what
the
court
did.
and
we
suggest
that
there
is
a
real
genius
in
the
decisions
of
the
courts
below,
a
very
great
perception
because
in
effect
it
hires
out
the
disputes
related
to
mergers
and
makes
the
interstate
commerce
act
the
applicable
law
and
obviates
the
risk
of
national
rail
strikes,
in
situations
where
the
unions
do
not
like
what
the
interstate
commerce
commission
requires.
we
feel
that,
if
i
may
say
in
conclusion,
we
feel
that
the
results
to
the
railroad
industry
itself
would
be
far
more
deleterious
and
far
more
adverse,
if
the
decisions
of
the
courts
below
were
reversed,
as
reflected
in
this
most
practical
intensely
practical
aspects
by
the
fact
situation
in
the
north
western
case
upon
which
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
very
heavily
relied.
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
yes,
it
could,
your
honor,
yes
it
could.
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
well,
if
i
may
use
the
phrase
--
the
real
beauty
of
the
decision
below,
because
the
court
held
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
not
the
railway
labor
act
applies
--
if
may
call
your
attention
mr.
justice
stewart
to
49
us
section
511
which
exempts
the
carriers
and
the
employees
from
the
operation
of
the
railway
labor
act.
mr.
thomas
j.
murray,
jr.
and
as
it
was
done
in
the
north
western,
they
threatened
a
strike
and
if
i
may
say
just
in
conclusion,
i
lost
the
case
in
the
northern
district
of
ohio,
three-and-a-half
weeks
ago
where
the
railroad
and
norfolk
and
western
came
in
and
rely
on
this
very
decision.
the
nemitz
case
and
i
may
take
just
a
moment
to
give
mr.
justice
stewart
the
facts
of
that
case.
the
railroad
attempted
to
change
the
merger
benefits,
to
adjust
them
downward
as
a
result
of
the
hours
of
service
act
amendments
which
limit
the
number
of
hours
an
employee
can
work.
and
the
union
took
a
national
strike
ballot
and
they
asked
me
to
take
the
case
to
court
and
i
knew
this
nemitz
case
was
here
and
i
knew
we
are
gong
to
meet
it
and
we
did
and
we
lost.
and
we
lost
because
the
court
said
that
the
law
that
applies
here
is
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
the
nemitz
decision
and
the
rationale
of
the
nemitz
in
north
western
decisions
literally,
in
that
case
in
c
70-145
that
will
be
recorded
in
the
federal
supplement,
that
case
literally
removed
the
risk
of
the
national
railroad
strike
and
it
is
give
an
expeditious
avenue
of
determination
of
disputes
which
arise
in
the
aftermath
of
these
complicated
rail
consolidation
which
are
bound
to
create
disputes
out
of
confusion
or
ignorance
or
whatever
as
was
done
this
case,
and
in
this
case
it
just
happened
to
be
that
the
victims
of
the
confusion
were
the
employees,
it
could
very
well

in
the
railroad,
the
railroads
themselves.
