very
well,
you
may
proceed.
chief

e.

so
try
to
assume
that
this
custom
that
you
described
of
having
the
railroad
and
the
union
workout
these
agreements
as
simply
reflection
of
the
fact
that
most
often
they
would
rather
workout
their
own
problems,
then
have
some
governmental
agency
impose
agreements
on
them.
chief

e.

mr.
lucente,
may
i
ask
one
question
before
you
sit
down.
you
are
adhering
to
your
position
on
the
jurisdictional
issue
here
i
take
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
a
comment
about
the
suggestion
in
your
opponent’s
brief
that
norfolk
and
western
apparently,
by
its
answer,
conceded
that
the
1962
agreement
was
incorporated
in
64?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
mr.
murray.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
us
that
they
breach
your
fiduciary
duty
as
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
why
i
was
leading
up
that
you
are
suggesting
here
to
take
into
attack
the
agreement,
undermined
on
that
ground
you
got
a
heavy,
heavy
burden
and
can
you
undermine
it
just
because
it
turns
out
to
be
an
improvidence,
undesirable,
unwise
agreements
having
in
mind
the
rather
explicit
provisions
of
the
statute
in
the
last
sentence
of
the
statute.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
conceivably
that
might
be
the
cause
of
action
of
some
kind
against
the
union,
that
would
be
in
agreement
to
this
situation,
would
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you
are
doing
and
your
suggestion
may
have
--
in
fact,
the
same
agreements
to
add
to
the
statute,
a
provision
after
the
word
employees,
unless
said
the
supplemental
agreement
reduces
the
benefits
of
the
employees?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
are
reading
the
statute
as
to
those
words
were
in
--
.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
not
that
really
add
up
to
where
we
were
before
that
perhaps
they
made
an
improvident
agreement?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
rather
dangerous
proposition
to
for
all
contracted
parties
to
urge
this
kind
of
relief
from
provident
contracts,
i
suspect
that
sometime
railroads
make
provident
contracts,
would
they
be
entitled
to
relief
because
of
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
a
little
like
arguing
though,
i
suggest
that
railroad
should
not
have
its
interest
undone
because
of
the
provident
agreement
made
by
their
lawyers
thereat.
