now
i
take,
mr.
selna,
in
your
remark
you
concede
there
is
some
limitations
than
other
than
a
broad
and
that
a
broad
general
interest
of
the
problems
of
ecology
is
not
enough.
to
be
more
specific,
if
there
were
a
controversy
about
the
installation
of
a
nuclear
power
plant
on
the
mississippi
river,
would
you
feel
the
sierra
club
would
have
standing

sue
in

that?

mr.
selna,
let
me
--
i
am
still
struggling.
let
me
ask
my
question
in
the
reverse
although
i
realize
it
is
one
perhaps
i
should
ask
the
solicitor
general.
if
an
organization
like
the
sierra
club
is
not
qualified
to
bring
litigation
of
this
kind
who
would
be
to
protect
alleged
overreaching
by
the
government
in
an
area
of
this
kind
where
i
take
it,
private
parts
of
land
are
not
anywhere
as
near
the
mineral
king
development?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
yet
it
has
been
used
rather
widely,
has
it
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
solicitor
general
i
have
one
question
and
i
suppose
it
is
presumptuous
of
me
to
ask
you
at
this
stage
of
the
case.
the
road,
if
put
in
and
developed,
would
be
at
best
a
two-lane
road
with
little
turn
places
or
passing
places.
it
strikes
me
as
though
this
likely
insufficient
for
the
number
of
daily
guests
and
trucking
requirements
for
the
disney
center
if
it
ever
comes.
do
you
have
any
feel
about
that?(voice
