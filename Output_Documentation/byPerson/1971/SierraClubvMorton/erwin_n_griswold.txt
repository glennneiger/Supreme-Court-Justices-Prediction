mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
important
i
think
to
get
the
setting
in
this
case.
mineral
king
is
not
a
wilderness
area
and
has
not
been
for
nearly
a
hundred
years.
there
was
substantial
mining
activity
there
back
in
the
1870’s.
road
into
mineral
king
was
built
by
the
county
of
tulare
in
the
1880’s
and
has
been
continuously
maintained
since
that
time.
that
is
the
road
--
this
is
the
main
public
highway
in
the
sequoia
park
and
this
is
the
road
which
has
existed
since
the
1880’s
for
nearly
90
years
in
the
mineral
king.
in
the
early
1900’s,
a
hydro
electric
facility
was
built
at
mineral
king
which
is
still
in
use
there.
there
are
many
cabins,
60
summer
homes,
two
small
resorts,
a
commercial
pack
station
and
three
public
camp
grounds
located
in
mineral
king
as
the
record
shows
at
page
80.
there
is
indeed
a
great
deal
of
wilderness
area
in
sequoia
national
park.
that
is
well
shown
by
the
map
which
is
near
the
end
of
the
brief
filed
in
this
case
by
tulare
county
which
is
essentially
the
same
area
as
the
map
on
the
board
behind
me.
but
the
enormous
grey
areas
on
that
map
are
wilderness
areas
had
been
so
designated
by
the
president
and
recommended
by
him
to
congress
for
establishment
as
wilderness
area.
the
publicly
occupied
part
of
sequoia
park
is
entirely
to
the
west,
in
here
where
the
big
trees
are.
all
of
this
area
over
here
is
wilderness
area.
mount
whitney
is
here
and
that
is
full
of
pack
trails
and
things
like
that
but
is
wilderness
area.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mount
whitney
is
on
the
border
of
the
park
about
here,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
we
had
been
under
something
of
a
dilemma
in
preparing
this
case.
it
has
been
our
best
judgment
that
a
decision
on
the
merits
of
the
case
would
be
in
favor
of
the
respondents
and
of
course
we
would
welcome
such
a
decision.
nevertheless,
a
decision
on
the
merits
could
be
reached
only
after
it
was
concluded
that
the
petitioner
had
adequate
standing
to
raise
the
questions
on
the
merits
in
the
district
court.
the
question
of
standing
is
important
to
the
government
and
to
the
court
too,
i
believe.
for
this
case
in
a
very
real
sense
is
the
ultimate
case
on
standing.
if
the
petitioner
here
has
standing
then
i
believe
it
is
fair
to
conclude
that
anyone
who
asserts
an
interest
in
a
controversy
has
standing.
in
our
judgment,
we
would
not
meet
our
responsibility
either
to
the
government
or
to
the
court
if
we
accepted
such
a
position
without
fully
canvassing
the
problems
involved.
the
sierra
club
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
there
are
bills
pending
before
congress,
we
referred
to
them
in
our
brief.
they
have
not
been
adopted.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
would
certainly
be
a
relevant
and
important.
i
am
not
sure
that
even
congress
has
the
power
to
create
a
case
or
controversy
which
is
within
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
although
it
is
certainly
relevant
and
could
press
the
matter
further
than
it
would
be
without
the
act
of
congress.
certainly
congress
can
in
certain
circumstances
authorize
what
had
been
called
by
the
attorney
generals.
the
sierra
club
is
the
only
plaintiff
here.
in
this
respect
it
is
different
from
what
--
for
example
overton
park,
there
are
many
other
plaintiffs
and
we
did
not
have
to
question
the
position
of
the
sierra
club.
in
this
complaint
in
the
district
court
it
did
not
allege
that
it
had
any
financial
interest
in
the
controversy.
it
did
not
allege
the
ownership
of
any
property
involved
or
any
interference
within
the
activities
that
it
is
conducting.
it
did
not
even
allege
a
special
interest
in
mineral
king.
the
whole
basis
of
their
standing
is
in
paragraph
three
of
the
complaint
at
the
top
of
page
4
of
the
appendix
and
it
is
--
its
sole
allegation
is
that
it
has
a
large
number
of
members
and
that
it
has
exhibited
a
special
interest
in
the
conservation
and
sound
maintenance
of
the
national
parks,
game
refuges
and
forests
of
the
country
and
that
would
include
new
hampshire
and
maine
as
well
as
california
with
particular
reference
to
the
national
resources
of
the
sierra
nevada
mountains
and
that
is
the
complete
allegation
in
the
complaint,
page
4,
paragraph
3.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
would
help,
but
they
have
not
done
it.
they
have
come
close
to
it
as
i
will
say
in
the
moment.
one
of
the
amici
here,
the
wilderness
society,
incidentally
i
find
i
have
19
papers
altogether
in
this
case,
something
of
a
pleasure
to
find
three
of
the
briefs
amici
filed
on
my
side
rather
than
having
them
all
against
me
and
i
would
call
attention
--
the
court’s
attention
particularly
to
the
brief
filed
by
the
county
of
tulare
and
the
brief
filed
by
the
far
west
ski
association,
both
of
which
it
seems
to
me
are
in
some
respects
rather
better
than
the
brief
which
have
--
we
have
filed.
but
the
wilderness
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
have
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
filed
the
--
the
one
i
am
referring
to
is
the
red
one
which
tulare
county
is
yellow
and
the
red
one
i
believe
leave
to
file
was
granted
by
consent
of
both
sides.
but
the
wilderness
society
says
that
the
sierra
club
really
has
more
specific
grounds
of
standing
and
in
its
reply
brief
and
then
the
oral
argument
here,
the
club
now
adopts
the
position
of
the
wilderness
society,
but
there
are
no
allegations
in
the
complaint
to
warrant
such
a
position.
the
complaint
was
based
solely
on
the
boldest
grounds
of
standing
of
interest.
it
is
not
inappropriate
to
conclude
i
think
that
the
sierra
club
took
this
position
for
two
reasons.
and
one
of
first
of
these
reasons
is
now
disclosed
in
--
on
page
six
of
their
reply
brief
where
they
say,
the
government
seeks
to
create
a
heads
i
win,
tails
you
lose
situation
in
which
either
the
courthouse
door
is
barred
for
lack
of
assertion
of
a
private
unique
injury
or
a
preliminary
injunction
is
denied
on
the
ground
of
the
litigant
who
has
advanced
private
injury,
has
advanced
private
injury
which
does
not
warrant
an
injunction
adverse
to
a
competing
public
interest.
counsel
have
shaped
their
case
to
avoid
this
trap.
what
they
say
is
that
if
they
had
a
real
plaintiff
here,
he
could
not
have
shown
irreparable
harm
because
whatever
damage
he
suffered
would
be
met
by
the
government.
they
could
not
on
that
basis
have
got
a
preliminary
injunction
so
they
had
to
appear
in
the
most
general
terms
in
order
to
get
a
preliminary
injunction
of
which
they
have
got.
and
then
the
second
ground
of
their
proceeding
is
they
have
i
think
is
in
the
hope
that
there
would
be
a
decision
on
the
merits
and
that
such
a
decision
would
thereby
establish
the
proposition
that
the
sierra
club
and
numerous
other
worthy
organizations,
old
and
new
have
standing
to
raise
in
court
any
legal
question
in
which
they
assert
an
interest
and
without
warrant.
if
such
a
result
is
reached,
i
believe
that
any
individual
whether
he
would
be
a
citizen
or
alien
and
in
the
(inaudible)
case
we
had
a
canadian
club
of
a
few
hundred
members
as
a
party
would
have
standing
to
raise
any
question
in
court
in
which
he
asserts
he
has
an
interest
without
more.
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
magic
in
the
fact
that
the
sierra
club
is
a
club
or
that
has
members
all
along
in
distinguished
history,
many
of
which
members
may
well
share
the
interest
which
its
management
now
advances.
if
it
is
the
fact
that
it
is
a
group
that
gives
its
standing,
how
big
a
group
must
it
be,
three
members
or
five
or
fifty
or
50,000?
what
reason
is
there
for
picking
any
number?
if
any
group
has
standing
because
it
has
an
intellectual
or
emotional
interest,
does
it
not
inevitably
follow
that
any
individual
who
asserts
an
interest
likewise
has
standing
to
raise
these
legal
questions.
if
the
sierra
club
has
standing
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
suggested,
would
not
john
muir
have
standing.
if
the
sierra
club
has
standing,
why
does
it
not
follow
that
john
gardner
and
my
ethnical
former
student
ralph
neider
likewise
have
standing
to
raise
in
court
any
questions
of
law
which
appeal
to
them
as
being
in
the
public
interest.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice,
although
i
think
it
is
--
i
think
it
is
very
close
to
the
line
but
i
think
it
is
on
the
proper
side
of
the
line.
that
is
a
little
complicated
because
it
arose
out
of
an
administrative
proceeding
and
as
i
understand
it
the
united
church
was
a
party
in
the
administrative
proceeding
and
thus
might
well
be
a
party
aggrieved
under
the
statute
authorized
by
congress.
here
there
has
been
no
administrative
proceeding
and
the
sierra
club
claims
no
standing
as
a
party.
i
can
accept
the
united
church
of
christ
case
perhaps
because
i
happen
to
like
the
outcome,
but
i
think
it
is
though
very
close
to
the
line
and
not
quite
the
same
as
this
one.
if
the
sierra
club
has
standing,
why
would
not
the
wilderness
society
and
the
other
amici
likewise
have
standing?
there
is
no
reason
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
there
is
no
reason
that
i
can
see
why
such
cases
would
have
to
brought
in
the
northern
district
of
california.
the
suits
are
against
government
officers
and
they
cannot
be
served
anywhere
in
the
united
states.
theoretically,
we
could
have
a
thousands
suits
brought
by
interested
individuals
and
organizations
in
the
93
judicial
districts
to
the
united
states
resulting
vast
confusion.
this
could
probably
--
perhaps
be
helped
by
transfer
and
special
procedures
for
molded
district
litigation.
but
it
would
become
flast
at
best.
now,
in
the
matter
involving
the
recent
(inaudible),
there
was
not
only
the
suit
in
the
district
of
columbia
or
that
of
which
came
to
this
court,
but
there
was
also
a
suit
in
the
district
court
in
alaska.
that
court
decided
the
case
on
november
4,
two
days
before
the
decision
here.
we
knew
about
the
decision,
but
did
not
have
the
text
available
on
the
saturday
morning
of
the
argument
here.
the
decision
was
favorable
to
the
government.
whether
it
was
in
some
way
entitled
to
a
res
judicata
effect,
i
do
not
know.
why
would
it
not
be
a
good
idea
to
have
let
anyone
raise
in
court
any
legal
issue
which
he
has
moved
to
raise.
at
least
if
he
has
moved
enough
to
litigate
about
it,
do
we
not
have
as
this
case
shows
the
vigorous
stress
of
the
adversary
system
so
that
this
court
and
the
lower
courts
will
be
fully
informed
on
the
issues
involved.
was
not
that
bridge
crossed
in
baker
against
carr.
but
the
plaintiff
in
baker
and
carr
lost
his
right
to
have
his
boat
fairly
accounted.
he
was
injured.
the
plaintiff
in
the
association
of
data
processing
service
organization
suffered
immediate
competitive
injury.
it
was
injured.
the
plaintiff
in
barlow
against
collins
separate
direct
economic
injury
or
at
least
contended
he
did.
as
far
as
i
know,
no
case
has
yet
been
decided
which
holds
that
a
plaintiff
which
merely
asserts
that
to
quote
from
the
complaint
here,
“its
interest
would
be
widely
affected
and
that“
and
that
“it
would
be
aggrieved”
by
the
acts
of
the
defendant
has
standing
to
raise
legal
questions
in
court.
but
why
not?
do
not
the
courts
exist
to
decide
legal
questions
and
are
they
not
the
most
impartial
and
learned
agencies
that
we
have
in
our
governmental
system.
are
there
not
many
questions
that
must
be
decided
by
the
courts?
why
should
not
the
courts
decide
any
question
that
any
citizen
wants
to
raise?
as
the
tenor
argument
indicates,
this
raises
i
think
a
true
question,
perhaps
to
somewhat
novel
question
in
the
separation
of
powers.
that
doctrine
derived
from
locke
and
montesquieu
and
others
which
permeates
our
constitution
in
the
federalist
papers
and
they
are
so
often
been
recognized
by
this
court
as
in
cases
as
divergent
as
marbury
against
madison
and
myers
against
the
united
states.
ours
is
not
a
government
by
the
judiciary.
it
is
a
government
of
three
branches,
each
of
which
was
intended
to
have
broad
and
effective
powers
subject
to
checks
and
balances.
in
litigable
cases,
the
courts
have
great
authority.
but
the
founders
also
intended
that
the
congress
should
have
wide
powers
and
that
the
executive
branch
should
have
wide
powers.
all
these
officers
have
great
responsibilities.
they
are
no
less
sworn
than
are
the
members
of
this
court
to
uphold
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
this
i
submit
is
what
really
lies
behind
the
standing
doctrine.
embodied
in
those
cryptic
words,
case
and
controversy
in
article
3
of
the
constitution.
analytically
one
could
have
a
system
of
government
in
which
every
legal
question
arising
in
the
(inaudible)
of
government
would
be
decided
by
the
courts.
it
would
not
be,
i
submit
a
good
system.
more
important,
it
is
not
the
system
which
was
ordained
and
established
in
our
constitution
as
it
has
been
understood
for
nearly
200
years.
over
the
past
20
or
25
years
there
has
been
a
great
shift
of
the
decision
of
legal
questions
in
our
governmental
operations
into
the
courts.
this
has
been
the
result
of
continuous
whittling
away
of
the
numerous
doctrines
which
have
been
established
over
the
years,
designed
to
minimize
the
number
of
governmental
questions
which
it
was
the
responsibility
of
the
courts
to
consider.
i
have
already
mentioned
the
most
ancient
of
a
case
or
controversy
which
was
earlier
relied
on
to
prevent
the
presentation
of
feigned
issues
to
the
court.
but
there
are
many
other
doctrines
which
i
cannot
go
into
in
detail;
reviewability,
justiciability,
sovereign
immunity,
mootness
in
various
aspects,
statutes
of
limitations
and
latches,
jurisdictional
amount,
real
party
and
interest
and
various
questions
in
relation
to
joinder.
under
all
of
these
headings,
limitations
which
previously
existed
to
minimize
the
number
of
questions
decided
in
courts
have
broken
down
in
varying
degrees.
i
might
also
mention
the
explosive
development
of
class
actions
which
has
sown
more
and
more
issues
into
the
courts.
in
this
connection
i
would
refer
to
the
case
of
laird
against
tatum
in
which
certiorari
was
granted
yesterday.
now
that
--
it
was
because
of
the
very
extreme
nature
of
the
position
in
that
case
that
i
thought
it
worthy
of
bringing
to
this
court.
the
position
there
is
that
the
plaintiff
can
maintain
that
suit
as
a
class
action,
although
the
plaintiffs
in
that
case
are
not
intimidated
as
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
they
bring
the
suit,
but
they
bring
it
on
behalf
of
others
citizens
who
might
be
intimidated
if
they
did
not
stand
up
and
talk
for
them.
and
similarly
in
the
case
of
alabama
against
the
secretary
of
the
treasury,
at
the
very
last
minute,
a
common
cause
applied
to
me
for
a
consent
to
file
a
brief,
amicus
curie,
i
thought
it
came
much
too
late
to
grant
my
consent.
i
do
not
know
whether
the
court
adopted
their
motion
or
not,
but
they
did
file
a
motion
and
a
brief
in
which
they
said
that
common
cause
intends
to
litigate
many
issues
involving
fiscal
and
other
matters,
and
therefore,
it
is
much
interested
in
the
questions
of
standing
involved
in
that
case.
if
there
is
standing
in
this
case
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
think
of
any
legal
issue
arising
in
government
which
will
not
have
to
await
one
or
more
decisions
of
a
court
or
the
administrator
sworn
to
uphold
the
law
can
take
any
action.
i
am
not
sure
that
this
is
good
for
the
government.
i
am
not
sure
if
it
is
good
for
the
courts.
i
do
find
myself
more
and
more
sure
that
it
is
not
the
kind
of
allocation
of
governmental
power
in
our
tripartite
constitutional
system
that
was
contemplated
by
the
founders.
this
point
is
well
and
briefly
covered
in
the
red
covered
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
far
west
ski
association.
in
this
case,
on
page
8
of
their
brief,
they
cautioned
against
the
situation
where
the
government
will
be
deceived
in
the
future
by
those
who
would
substitute
their
judgment
for
the
government’s
judgment
to
the
point
where
it
can
no
longer
fulfill
its
responsibilities
to
its
citizens.
and
they
add
on
page
9,
administrators
must
be
held
to
act
within
the
scope
of
authority
provided
them,
but
likewise
actions
which
they
take
within
that
scope
of
authority
must
not
be
subjected
to
protected
litigation
for
the
sole
purpose
of
forcing
another
look
at
the
decision
already
reached.
i
do
not
suggest
that
the
administrators
can
act
at
their
whim
and
without
any
check
at
all.
on
the
contrary
in
this
area
they
are
subject
to
continuous
check
by
the
congress.
congress
can
stop
this
development
anytime
it
wants
to.
i
think
it
was
to
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
must
conclude
my
argument
on
standing.
the
issue
here
in
that
respect
is
a
basic
and
fundamental
one.
it
is
the
appropriate
limit
on
the
judicial
function
under
our
constitutional
system.
should
judges
be
dealing
almost
continuously
with
heeded
socio
and
economic
controversies?
will
not
the
courts
be
in
a
better
position
to
decide
the
many
difficult
and
important
questions,
which
only
the
courts
can
effectively
resolve
in
our
constitutional
system?
if
they
do
not
undertake
to
decide
all
the
legal
questions,
that
anyone
wants
to
present
to
them.
now,
with
respect
to
the
merits,
there
are
essentially
three
questions.
there
is
the
question
of
the
term
permit
not
exceeding
80
acres
for
30
years.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice
but
that
turns
in
part
on
the
questions
of
standing.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
on
the
merits
by
that,
i
mean,
on
whether
there
was
sufficient
chance
that
the
plaintiff
could
win
in
a
trial
on
the
merits
that
it
was
appropriate
for
the
court
to
grant
a
temporary
injunction.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
appreciate
that
mr.
justice,
but
if
the
court
can
conclude
that,
the
legal
situation
is
such
that
no
showing
of
facts
would
warrant
the
issuance
of
a
permanent
injunction
then
there
should
not
be
issued
a
temporary
injunction
or
indeed
even
less
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
only
mr.
justice
that
they
are
not
serious
enough
to
make
it
appropriate
to
grant
a
temporary
injunction
without
a
trial.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
you
do
not
have
finally
to
decide
them,
but
my
position
is
that
it
can
be
readily
found
that
they
are
not
serious
enough
so
as
to
warrant
the
granting
of
a
permanent
injunction
even
though
there
is
some
chance
that
after
trial
it
might
be
that
circumstances
could
be
shown
which
would
lead
to
the
other
conclusion.
mineral
king
is
not
a
national
forest,
excuse
me,
mineral
king
is
a
national
forest.
it
was
excluded
from
the
sequoia
national
park
in
1926
because
there
were
mining
claims
there.
it
is
perfectly
obvious
that
it
is
geographically
a
part
of
the
park
area
and
new
mining
claims
cannot
be
located
in
a
national
park.
although
it
is
not
a
national
park
it
was
made
a
national
game
refuge
and
the
function
of
that
is
that
hunting
is
not
allowed
in
a
national
game
refuge,
although
it
is
allowed
in
a
national
park.
there
is
nothing
about
making
it
a
national
game
refuge
which
means
that
it
must
be
kept
to
wilderness
or
that
people
may
not
use
the
park
freely.
as
long
as
it
goes
to
1949,
the
secretary
of
agriculture
designated
the
area
as
a
recreation
area
“hereby
set
apart
and
reserved
for
public
recreation
use.”a
nd
in
1960
congress
enacted
the
multiple-use
sustained-yield
act
which
provides
for
recreational
use.
there
are
two
statutes,
one
of
which
now
authorizes
term
permits
for
80
years,
the
other
of
which
authorizes
the
term
permits
for
80
hectares
up
to
30
years,
the
other
of
which
authorizes
revocable
permits
without
limitation
of
area,
but
always
revocable.
and
the
legislative
history
makes
its
perfectly
plain
that
when
congress
extended
the
term
permit
area
from
five
hectares
to
80
hectares
in
1956
both
committees
and
both
houses
of
congress
recorded
in
the
committee
reports
that
the
department
of
agriculture
now
has
adequate
authority
to
issue
revocable
permits
for
all
purposes
under
the
act
of
june
4,
1897.
i
do
not
see
that
there
is
any
basis
for
saying
that
there
cannot
be
both
term
permits
and
revocable
permits.
and
as
the
appendix
in
our
brief
shows,
there
are
84
situations
where
that
has
been
done
over
a
period
of
many
years
and
both
the
practical
construction
and
the
fact
that
this
has
been
repeatedly
called
to
the
attention
of
congress,
lead
to
that
conclusion.
now,
with
respect
to
the
highway
through
the
park
that
becomes
interior
department
rather
than
agriculture
department.
16
u.s.c.
8
expressly
provides
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
shall
have
power
“to
construct,
reconstruct
and
improve
roads
in
the
national
parks.
this
is
either
a
construction
of
a
new
road
or
a
reconstruction.
it
is
in
part
on
the
same
right
of
way
and
in
part
elsewhere.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
which
says
that
the
road
must
be
for
park
purposes
nevertheless,
the
road
does
have
a
legitimate
park
use.
it
will
enable
people
to
see
areas
in
the
park
which
would
not
otherwise
be
available
to
them.
it
will
connect
with
certain
areas
in
the
park
where
there
are
no
camps.
more
important
i
am
advised
that
it
will
provide
markedly
improved
access
for
equipment
and
men
engaged
in
fighting
forest
fires
within
the
park.
perhaps
the
superficially
most
difficult
problem
in
the
case
is
the
provision
with
respect
to
the
electric
line.
this
is
a
66,000
volt
transmission
line
which,
however,
is
to
be
buried
in
the
road.
no
powers
and
no
cables
and
we
do
have
a
statute,
section
45
(c)
which
says
that
no
permit,
license,
lease
and
so
forth
for
conduits,
reservoirs,
dams,
power
houses,
transmission
lines
or
other
works
for
storage
or
carriage
of
water
shall
be
granted
or
made
without
specific
authority
from
congress.
and
the
best
statute
is
read
alone,
it
becomes
a
very
difficult
to
deal
with.
however,
the
legislative
history
shows
very
plainly
that
this
language
first
appeared
in
the
federal
power
act
and
was
intended
to
prevent
the
federal
power
commission
from
granting
licenses
to
build
a
hydroelectric
establishments,
dams,
water
park
and
transmission
lines
in
national
parks.
when
sequoia
national
park,
this
was
done
in
1921,
when
sequoia
national
park
was
established
in
1926,
this
same
paragraph
was
taken
over
verbatim
and
put
into
the
sequoia
national
park
act.
but
at
that
time
congress
expressed
in
the
committee
report
that
this
was
done
to
prohibit
the
development
of
hydroelectric
power
in
the
proposed
enlarged
part,
in
except
by
act
of
congress.
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
hydroelectric
power.
there
are
other
statutes
which
expressly
authorizes
the
secretary
to
grant
rights
of
way
for
electric
poles,
plants
and
lines
for
the
generation
and
distribution
of
electrical
power
and
for
telephone
and
telegraph
purposes.
and
in
the
light
of
all
the
history,
we
think
it
is
plain
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
repeal
old
statute
when
it
could
in
this
provision
designed
to
prevent
the
establishment
of
hydro
electric
establishments
in
the
national
park.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
is
a
provision
in
the
proposed
permit
mr.
justice,
which
says
that
the
road
will
not
be
increased
in
size
and
that
if
it
turns
out
to
be
inadequate
that
the
state
will
provide
other
means
for
getting
into
the
area
and
it
is
possible
to
do
so
and
this
i
am
told
is
paragraph
37
of
the
proposed
permit
on
page
76
of
our
brief
as
a
condition
for
granting
this
permit,
permitee
which
is
the
state
of
california
agrees
that
should
it
ever
be
necessary
in
the
future
to
provide
for
increased
visitor
capacity
in
mineral
king,
an
alternate
means
of
access
to
mineral
king
shall
be
provided
which
does
not
involve
access
through
the
park
or
in
the
alternatives
such
excess
capacity
shall
be
accommodated
through
mechanical
means
in
lieu
of
any
further
improvement
of
road
access
and
the
only
thing
that
i
could
think
of
that
the
mechanical
means
is
would
be
helicopters
or
maybe
some
other
kind
of
airplanes.
i
am
told
that
it
is
possible
to
construct
roads
through
here,
which
however
would
be
much
longer
and
would
involve
greater
injury
to
public
land,
though
not
the
national
park.
certainly
the
problem
with
which
your
question
is
directed
mr.
justice
has
been
considered
by
the
department.
let
me
say
just
one
more
thing.
there
is
some
confusions
where
which
we
are
to
blame
about
the
difference
between
this
appendix
in
our
brief
of
a
proposed
permit
being
different
from
the
one
in
the
ninth
circuit.
it
was
not
intended
to
be.
it
is
intended
to
be
the
same
permit,
but
when
it
got
to
our
office,
a
member
of
my
staff
found
that
there
were
two
paragraph
17,
so
he
proceeded
to
renumber
the
subsequent
paragraphs
and
that
naturally
is
confusing,
but
this
is
essentially
the
same
permit
as
was
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
i
covered
standing
in
the
footnote.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
oh!
yes
i
am
sure
it
is
in
my
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
will
find
it
and
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
thank
you.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
i
mr.
justice
douglas’
question?
mr.
justice
douglas
it
was
not
a
footnote,
it
is
on
page
17
of
our
brief.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
just
at
the
middle
of
the
page
and
then
there
is
a
related
reference
on
page
26
with
a
footnote
following
that
and
i
think
that
is
what
i
had
in
mind.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
at
pages
17
and
26.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
important
i
think
to
get
the
setting
in
this
case.
mineral
king
is
not
a
wilderness
area
and
has
not
been
for
nearly
a
hundred
years.
there
was
substantial
mining
activity
there
back
in
the
1870’s.
road
into
mineral
king
was
built
by
the
county
of
tulare
in
the
1880’s
and
has
been
continuously
maintained
since
that
time.
that
is
the
road
--
this
is
the
main
public
highway
in
the
sequoia
park
and
this
is
the
road
which
has
existed
since
the
1880’s
for
nearly
90
years
in
the
mineral
king.
in
the
early
1900’s,
a
hydro
electric
facility
was
built
at
mineral
king
which
is
still
in
use
there.
there
are
many
cabins,
60
summer
homes,
two
small
resorts,
a
commercial
pack
station
and
three
public
camp
grounds
located
in
mineral
king
as
the
record
shows
at
page
80.
there
is
indeed
a
great
deal
of
wilderness
area
in
sequoia
national
park.
that
is
well
shown
by
the
map
which
is
near
the
end
of
the
brief
filed
in
this
case
by
tulare
county
which
is
essentially
the
same
area
as
the
map
on
the
board
behind
me.
but
the
enormous
grey
areas
on
that
map
are
wilderness
areas
had
been
so
designated
by
the
president
and
recommended
by
him
to
congress
for
establishment
as
wilderness
area.
the
publicly
occupied
part
of
sequoia
park
is
entirely
to
the
west,
in
here
where
the
big
trees
are.
all
of
this
area
over
here
is
wilderness
area.
mount
whitney
is
here
and
that
is
full
of
pack
trails
and
things
like
that
but
is
wilderness
area.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mount
whitney
is
on
the
border
of
the
park
about
here,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
we
had
been
under
something
of
a
dilemma
in
preparing
this
case.
it
has
been
our
best
judgment
that
a
decision
on
the
merits
of
the
case
would
be
in
favor
of
the
respondents
and
of
course
we
would
welcome
such
a
decision.
nevertheless,
a
decision
on
the
merits
could
be
reached
only
after
it
was
concluded
that
the
petitioner
had
adequate
standing
to
raise
the
questions
on
the
merits
in
the
district
court.
the
question
of
standing
is
important
to
the
government
and
to
the
court
too,
i
believe.
for
this
case
in
a
very
real
sense
is
the
ultimate
case
on
standing.
if
the
petitioner
here
has
standing
then
i
believe
it
is
fair
to
conclude
that
anyone
who
asserts
an
interest
in
a
controversy
has
standing.
in
our
judgment,
we
would
not
meet
our
responsibility
either
to
the
government
or
to
the
court
if
we
accepted
such
a
position
without
fully
canvassing
the
problems
involved.
the
sierra
club
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
there
are
bills
pending
before
congress,
we
referred
to
them
in
our
brief.
they
have
not
been
adopted.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
would
certainly
be
a
relevant
and
important.
i
am
not
sure
that
even
congress
has
the
power
to
create
a
case
or
controversy
which
is
within
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
although
it
is
certainly
relevant
and
could
press
the
matter
further
than
it
would
be
without
the
act
of
congress.
certainly
congress
can
in
certain
circumstances
authorize
what
had
been
called
by
the
attorney
generals.
the
sierra
club
is
the
only
plaintiff
here.
in
this
respect
it
is
different
from
what
--
for
example
overton
park,
there
are
many
other
plaintiffs
and
we
did
not
have
to
question
the
position
of
the
sierra
club.
in
this
complaint
in
the
district
court
it
did
not
allege
that
it
had
any
financial
interest
in
the
controversy.
it
did
not
allege
the
ownership
of
any
property
involved
or
any
interference
within
the
activities
that
it
is
conducting.
it
did
not
even
allege
a
special
interest
in
mineral
king.
the
whole
basis
of
their
standing
is
in
paragraph
three
of
the
complaint
at
the
top
of
page
4
of
the
appendix
and
it
is
--
its
sole
allegation
is
that
it
has
a
large
number
of
members
and
that
it
has
exhibited
a
special
interest
in
the
conservation
and
sound
maintenance
of
the
national
parks,
game
refuges
and
forests
of
the
country
and
that
would
include
new
hampshire
and
maine
as
well
as
california
with
particular
reference
to
the
national
resources
of
the
sierra
nevada
mountains
and
that
is
the
complete
allegation
in
the
complaint,
page
4,
paragraph
3.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
would
help,
but
they
have
not
done
it.
they
have
come
close
to
it
as
i
will
say
in
the
moment.
one
of
the
amici
here,
the
wilderness
society,

i

papers
altogether
in
this
case,
something
of
a
pleasure
to
find
three
of
the
briefs
amici
filed
on
my
side
rather
than
having
them
all
against
me
and
i
would
call
attention
--
the
court’s
attention
particularly
to
the
brief
filed
by
the
county
of
tulare
and
the
brief
filed
by
the
far
west
ski
association,
both
of
which
it
seems
to
me
are
in
some
respects
rather
better
than
the
brief
which
have
--
we
have
filed.
but
the
wilderness
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
have
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
filed
the
--
the
one
i
am
referring
to
is
the
red
one
which
tulare
county
is
yellow
and
the
red
one
i
believe
leave
to
file
was
granted
by
consent
of
both
sides.
but
the
wilderness
society
says
that
the
sierra
club
really
has
more
specific
grounds
of
standing
and
in
its
reply
brief
and
then
the
oral
argument
here,
the
club
now
adopts
the
position
of
the
wilderness
society,
but
there
are
no
allegations
in
the
complaint
to
warrant
such
a
position.
the
complaint
was
based
solely
on
the
boldest
grounds
of
standing
of
interest.
it
is
not
inappropriate
to
conclude
i
think
that
the
sierra
club
took
this
position
for
two
reasons.
and
one
of
first
of
these
reasons
is
now
disclosed
in
--
on
page
six
of
their
reply
brief
where
they
say,
the
government
seeks
to
create
a
heads
i
win,
tails
you
lose
situation
in
which
either
the
courthouse
door
is
barred
for
lack
of
assertion
of
a
private
unique
injury
or
a
preliminary
injunction
is
denied
on
the
ground
of
the
litigant
who
has
advanced
private
injury,
has
advanced
private
injury
which
does
not
warrant
an
injunction
adverse
to
a
competing
public
interest.
counsel
have
shaped
their
case
to
avoid
this
trap.
what
they
say
is
that
if
they
had
a
real
plaintiff
here,
he
could
not
have
shown
irreparable
harm
because
whatever
damage
he
suffered
would
be
met
by
the
government.
they
could
not
on
that
basis
have
got
a
preliminary
injunction
so
they
had
to
appear
in
the
most
general
terms
in
order
to
get
a
preliminary
injunction
of
which
they
have
got.
and
then
the
second
ground
of
their
proceeding
is
they
have
i
think
is
in
the
hope
that
there
would
be
a
decision
on
the
merits
and
that
such
a
decision
would
thereby
establish
the
proposition
that
the
sierra
club
and
numerous
other
worthy
organizations,
old
and
new
have
standing
to
raise
in
court
any
legal
question
in
which
they
assert
an
interest
and
without
warrant.
if
such
a
result
is
reached,
i
believe
that
any
individual
whether
he
would
be
a
citizen
or
alien
and
in
the
(inaudible)
case
we
had
a
canadian
club
of
a
few
hundred
members
as
a
party
would
have
standing
to
raise
any
question
in
court
in
which
he
asserts
he
has
an
interest
without
more.
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
magic
in
the
fact
that
the
sierra
club
is
a
club
or
that
has
members
all
along
in
distinguished
history,
many
of
which
members
may
well
share
the
interest
which
its
management
now
advances.
if
it
is
the
fact
that
it
is
a
group
that
gives
its
standing,
how
big
a
group
must
it
be,
three
members
or
five
or
fifty
or
50,000?
what
reason
is
there
for
picking
any
number?
if
any
group
has
standing
because
it
has
an
intellectual
or
emotional
interest,
does
it
not
inevitably
follow
that
any
individual
who
asserts
an
interest
likewise
has
standing
to
raise
these
legal
questions.
if
the
sierra
club
has
standing
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
suggested,
would
not
john
muir
have
standing.
if
the
sierra
club
has
standing,
why
does
it
not
follow
that
john
gardner
and
my
ethnical
former
student
ralph
neider
likewise
have
standing
to
raise
in
court
any
questions
of
law
which
appeal
to
them
as
being
in
the
public
interest.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice,
although
i
think
it
is
--
i
think
it
is
very
close
to
the
line
but
i
think
it
is
on
the
proper
side
of
the
line.
that
is
a
little
complicated
because
it
arose
out
of
an
administrative
proceeding
and
as
i
understand
it
the
united
church
was
a
party
in
the
administrative
proceeding
and
thus
might
well
be
a
party
aggrieved
under
the
statute
authorized
by
congress.
here
there
has
been
no
administrative
proceeding
and
the
sierra
club
claims
no
standing
as
a
party.
i
can
accept
the
united
church
of
christ
case
perhaps
because
i
happen
to
like
the
outcome,
but
i
think
it
is
though
very
close
to
the
line
and
not
quite
the
same
as
this
one.
if
the
sierra
club
has
standing,
why
would
not
the
wilderness
society
and
the
other
amici
likewise
have
standing?
there
is
no
reason
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
there
is
no
reason
that
i
can
see
why
such
cases
would
have
to
brought
in
the
northern
district
of
california.
the
suits
are
against
government
officers
and
they
cannot
be
served
anywhere
in
the
united
states.
theoretically,
we
could
have
a
thousands
suits
brought
by
interested
individuals
and
organizations
in
the
93
judicial
districts
to
the
united
states
resulting
vast
confusion.
this
could
probably
--
perhaps
be
helped
by
transfer
and
special
procedures
for
molded
district
litigation.
but
it
would
become
flast
at
best.
now,
in
the
matter
involving
the
recent
(inaudible),
there
was
not
only
the
suit
in
the
district
of
columbia
or
that
of
which
came
to
this
court,
but
there
was
also
a
suit
in
the
district
court
in
alaska.
that
court
decided
the
case
on
november
4,
two
days
before
the
decision
here.
we
knew
about
the
decision,
but
did
not
have
the
text
available
on
the
saturday
morning
of
the
argument
here.
the
decision
was
favorable
to
the
government.
whether
it
was
in
some
way
entitled
to
a
res
judicata
effect,
i
do
not
know.
why
would
it
not
be
a
good
idea
to
have
let
anyone
raise
in
court
any
legal
issue
which
he
has
moved
to
raise.
at
least
if
he
has
moved
enough
to
litigate
about
it,
do
we
not
have
as
this
case
shows
the
vigorous
stress
of
the
adversary
system
so
that
this
court
and
the
lower
courts
will
be
fully
informed
on
the
issues
involved.
was
not
that
bridge
crossed
in
baker
against
carr.
but
the
plaintiff
in
baker
and
carr
lost
his
right
to
have
his
boat
fairly
accounted.
he
was
injured.
the
plaintiff
in
the
association
of
data
processing
service
organization
suffered
immediate
competitive
injury.
it
was
injured.
the
plaintiff
in
barlow
against
collins
separate
direct
economic
injury
or
at
least
contended
he
did.
as
far
as
i
know,
no
case
has
yet
been
decided
which
holds
that
a
plaintiff
which
merely
asserts
that
to
quote
from
the
complaint
here,
“its
interest
would
be
widely
affected
and
that“
and
that
“it
would
be
aggrieved”
by
the
acts
of
the
defendant
has
standing
to
raise
legal
questions
in
court.
but
why
not?
do
not
the
courts
exist
to
decide
legal
questions
and
are
they
not
the
most
impartial
and
learned
agencies
that
we
have
in
our
governmental
system.
are
there
not
many
questions
that
must
be
decided
by
the
courts?
why
should
not
the
courts
decide
any
question
that
any
citizen
wants
to
raise?
as
the
tenor
argument
indicates,
this
raises
i
think
a
true
question,
perhaps
to
somewhat
novel
question
in
the
separation
of
powers.
that
doctrine
derived
from
locke
and
montesquieu
and
others
which
permeates
our
constitution
in
the
federalist
papers
and
they
are
so
often
been
recognized
by
this
court
as
in
cases
as
divergent
as
marbury
against
madison
and
myers
against
the
united
states.
ours
is
not
a
government
by
the
judiciary.
it
is
a
government
of
three
branches,
each
of
which
was
intended
to
have
broad
and
effective
powers
subject
to
checks
and
balances.
in
litigable
cases,
the
courts
have
great
authority.
but
the
founders
also
intended
that
the
congress
should
have
wide
powers
and
that
the
executive
branch
should
have
wide
powers.
all
these
officers
have
great
responsibilities.
they
are
no
less
sworn
than
are
the
members
of
this
court
to
uphold
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
this
i
submit
is
what
really
lies
behind
the
standing
doctrine.
embodied
in
those
cryptic
words,
case
and
controversy
in
article
3
of
the
constitution.
analytically
one
could
have
a
system
of
government
in
which
every
legal
question
arising
in
the
(inaudible)
of
government
would
be
decided
by
the
courts.
it
would
not
be,
i
submit
a
good
system.
more
important,
it
is
not
the
system
which
was
ordained
and
established
in
our
constitution
as
it
has
been
understood
for
nearly
200
years.
over
the
past
20
or
25
years
there
has
been
a
great
shift
of
the
decision
of
legal
questions
in
our
governmental
operations
into
the
courts.
this
has
been
the
result
of
continuous
whittling
away
of
the
numerous
doctrines
which
have
been
established
over
the
years,
designed
to
minimize
the
number
of
governmental
questions
which
it
was
the
responsibility
of
the
courts
to
consider.
i
have
already
mentioned
the
most
ancient
of
a
case
or
controversy
which
was
earlier
relied
on
to
prevent
the
presentation
of
feigned
issues
to
the
court.
but
there
are
many
other
doctrines
which
i
cannot
go
into
in
detail;
reviewability,
justiciability,
sovereign
immunity,
mootness
in
various
aspects,
statutes
of
limitations
and
latches,
jurisdictional
amount,
real
party
and
interest
and
various
questions
in
relation
to
joinder.
under
all
of
these
headings,
limitations
which
previously
existed
to
minimize
the
number
of
questions
decided
in
courts
have
broken
down
in
varying
degrees.
i
might
also
mention
the
explosive
development
of
class
actions
which
has
sown
more
and
more
issues
into
the
courts.
in
this
connection
i
would
refer
to
the
case
of
laird
against
tatum
in
which
certiorari
was
granted
yesterday.
now
that
--
it
was
because
of
the
very
extreme
nature
of
the
position
in
that
case
that
i
thought
it
worthy
of
bringing
to
this
court.
the
position
there
is
that
the
plaintiff
can
maintain
that
suit
as
a
class
action,
although
the
plaintiffs
in
that
case
are
not
intimidated
as
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
they
bring
the
suit,
but
they
bring
it
on
behalf
of
others
citizens
who
might
be
intimidated
if
they
did
not
stand
up
and
talk
for
them.
and
similarly
in
the
case
of
alabama
against
the
secretary
of
the
treasury,
at
the
very
last
minute,
a
common
cause
applied
to
me
for
a
consent
to
file
a
brief,
amicus
curie,
i
thought
it
came
much
too
late
to
grant
my
consent.
i
do
not
know
whether
the
court
adopted
their
motion
or
not,
but
they
did
file
a
motion
and
a
brief
in
which
they
said
that
common
cause
intends
to
litigate
many
issues
involving
fiscal
and
other
matters,
and
therefore,
it
is
much
interested
in
the
questions
of
standing
involved
in
that
case.
if
there
is
standing
in
this
case
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
think
of
any
legal
issue
arising
in
government
which
will
not
have
to
await
one
or
more
decisions
of
a
court
or
the
administrator
sworn
to
uphold
the
law
can
take
any
action.
i
am
not
sure
that
this
is
good
for
the
government.
i
am
not
sure
if
it
is
good
for
the
courts.
i
do
find
myself
more
and
more
sure
that
it
is
not
the
kind
of
allocation
of
governmental
power
in
our
tripartite
constitutional
system
that
was
contemplated
by
the
founders.
this
point
is
well
and
briefly
covered
in
the
red
covered
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
far
west
ski
association.
in
this
case,
on
page
8
of
their
brief,
they
cautioned
against
the
situation
where
the
government
will
be
deceived
in
the
future
by
those
who
would
substitute
their
judgment
for
the
government’s
judgment
to
the
point
where
it
can
no
longer
fulfill
its
responsibilities
to
its
citizens.
and
they
add
on
page
9,
administrators
must
be
held
to
act
within
the
scope
of
authority
provided
them,
but
likewise
actions
which
they
take
within
that
scope
of
authority
must
not
be
subjected
to
protected
litigation
for
the
sole
purpose
of
forcing
another
look
at
the
decision
already
reached.
i
do
not
suggest
that
the
administrators
can
act
at
their
whim
and
without
any
check
at
all.
on
the
contrary
in
this
area
they
are
subject
to
continuous
check
by
the
congress.
congress
can
stop
this
development
anytime
it
wants
to.
i
think
it
was
to
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
must
conclude
my
argument
on
standing.
the
issue
here
in
that
respect
is
a
basic
and
fundamental
one.
it
is
the
appropriate
limit
on
the
judicial
function
under
our
constitutional
system.
should
judges
be
dealing
almost
continuously
with
heeded
socio
and
economic
controversies?
will
not
the
courts
be
in
a
better
position
to
decide
the
many
difficult
and
important
questions,
which
only
the
courts
can
effectively
resolve
in
our
constitutional
system?
if
they
do
not
undertake
to
decide
all
the
legal
questions,
that
anyone
wants
to
present
to
them.
now,
with
respect
to
the
merits,
there
are
essentially
three
questions.
there
is
the
question
of
the
term
permit
not
exceeding
80
acres
for
30
years.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice
but
that
turns
in
part
on
the
questions
of
standing.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
on
the
merits
by
that,
i
mean,
on
whether
there
was
sufficient
chance
that
the
plaintiff
could
win
in
a
trial
on
the
merits
that
it
was
appropriate
for
the
court
to
grant
a
temporary
injunction.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
appreciate
that
mr.
justice,
but
if
the
court
can
conclude
that,
the
legal
situation
is
such
that
no
showing
of
facts
would
warrant
the
issuance
of
a
permanent
injunction
then
there
should
not
be
issued
a
temporary
injunction
or
indeed
even
less
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
only
mr.
justice
that
they
are
not
serious
enough
to
make
it
appropriate
to
grant
a
temporary
injunction
without
a
trial.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
you
do
not
have
finally
to
decide
them,
but
my
position
is
that
it
can
be
readily
found
that
they
are
not
serious
enough
so
as
to
warrant
the
granting
of
a
permanent
injunction
even
though
there
is
some
chance
that
after
trial
it
might
be
that
circumstances
could
be
shown
which
would
lead
to
the
other
conclusion.
mineral
king
is
not
a
national
forest,
excuse
me,
mineral
king
is
a
national
forest.
it
was
excluded
from
the
sequoia
national
park
in
1926
because
there
were
mining
claims
there.
it
is
perfectly
obvious
that
it
is
geographically
a
part
of
the
park
area
and
new
mining
claims
cannot
be
located
in
a
national
park.
although
it
is
not
a
national
park
it
was
made
a
national
game
refuge
and
the
function
of
that
is
that
hunting
is
not
allowed
in
a
national
game
refuge,
although
it
is
allowed
in
a
national
park.
there
is
nothing
about
making
it
a
national
game
refuge
which
means
that
it
must
be
kept
to
wilderness
or
that
people
may
not
use
the
park
freely.
as
long
as
it
goes
to
1949,
the
secretary
of
agriculture
designated
the
area
as
a
recreation
area
“hereby
set
apart
and
reserved
for
public
recreation
use.”a
nd
in
1960
congress
enacted
the
multiple-use
sustained-yield
act
which
provides
for
recreational
use.
there
are
two
statutes,
one
of
which
now
authorizes
term
permits
for
80
years,
the
other
of
which
authorizes
the
term
permits
for
80
hectares
up
to
30
years,
the
other
of
which
authorizes
revocable
permits
without
limitation
of
area,
but
always
revocable.
and
the
legislative
history
makes
its
perfectly
plain
that
when
congress
extended
the
term
permit
area
from
five
hectares
to
80
hectares
in
1956
both
committees
and
both
houses
of
congress
recorded
in
the
committee
reports
that
the
department
of
agriculture
now
has
adequate
authority
to
issue
revocable
permits
for
all
purposes
under
the
act
of
june
4,
1897.
i
do
not
see
that
there
is
any
basis
for
saying
that
there
cannot
be
both
term
permits
and
revocable
permits.
and
as
the
appendix
in
our
brief
shows,
there
are
84
situations
where
that
has
been
done
over
a
period
of
many
years
and
both
the
practical
construction
and
the
fact
that
this
has
been
repeatedly
called
to
the
attention
of
congress,
lead
to
that
conclusion.
now,
with
respect
to
the
highway
through
the
park
that
becomes
interior
department
rather
than
agriculture
department.
16
u.s.c.

expressly
provides
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
shall
have
power
“to
construct,
reconstruct
and
improve
roads
in
the
national
parks.
this
is
either
a
construction
of
a
new
road
or
a
reconstruction.
it
is
in
part
on
the
same
right
of
way
and
in
part
elsewhere.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
which
says
that
the
road
must
be
for
park
purposes
nevertheless,
the
road
does
have
a
legitimate
park
use.
it
will
enable
people
to
see
areas
in
the
park
which
would
not
otherwise
be
available
to
them.
it
will
connect
with
certain
areas
in
the
park
where
there
are
no
camps.
more
important
i
am
advised
that
it
will
provide
markedly
improved
access
for
equipment
and
men
engaged
in
fighting
forest
fires
within
the
park.
perhaps
the
superficially
most
difficult
problem
in
the
case
is
the
provision
with
respect
to
the
electric
line.
this
is
a
66,000
volt
transmission
line
which,
however,
is
to
be
buried
in
the
road.
no
powers
and
no
cables
and
we
do
have
a
statute,
section
45
(c)
which
says
that
no
permit,
license,
lease
and
so
forth
for
conduits,
reservoirs,
dams,
power
houses,
transmission
lines
or
other
works
for
storage
or
carriage
of
water
shall
be
granted
or
made
without
specific
authority
from
congress.
and
the
best
statute
is
read
alone,
it
becomes
a
very
difficult
to
deal
with.
however,
the
legislative
history
shows
very
plainly
that
this
language
first
appeared
in
the
federal
power
act
and
was
intended
to
prevent
the
federal
power
commission
from
granting
licenses
to
build
a
hydroelectric
establishments,
dams,
water
park
and
transmission
lines
in
national
parks.
when
sequoia
national
park,
this
was
done
in
1921,
when
sequoia
national
park
was
established
in
1926,
this
same
paragraph
was
taken
over
verbatim
and
put
into
the
sequoia
national
park
act.
but
at
that
time
congress
expressed
in
the
committee
report
that
this
was
done
to
prohibit
the
development
of
hydroelectric
power
in
the
proposed
enlarged
part,
in
except
by
act
of
congress.
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
hydroelectric
power.
there
are
other
statutes
which
expressly
authorizes
the
secretary
to
grant
rights
of
way
for
electric
poles,
plants
and
lines
for
the
generation
and
distribution
of
electrical
power
and
for
telephone
and
telegraph
purposes.
and
in
the
light
of
all
the
history,
we
think
it
is
plain
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
repeal
old
statute
when
it
could
in
this
provision
designed
to
prevent
the
establishment
of
hydro
electric
establishments
in
the
national
park.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
is
a
provision
in
the
proposed
permit
mr.
justice,
which
says
that
the
road
will
not
be
increased
in
size
and
that
if
it
turns
out
to
be
inadequate
that
the
state
will
provide
other
means
for
getting
into
the
area
and
it
is
possible
to
do
so
and
this
i
am
told
is
paragraph
37
of
the
proposed
permit
on
page
76
of
our
brief
as
a
condition
for
granting
this
permit,
permitee
which
is
the
state
of
california
agrees
that
should
it
ever
be
necessary
in
the
future
to
provide
for
increased
visitor
capacity
in
mineral
king,
an
alternate
means
of
access
to
mineral
king
shall
be
provided
which
does
not
involve
access
through
the
park
or
in
the
alternatives
such
excess
capacity
shall
be
accommodated
through
mechanical
means
in
lieu
of
any
further
improvement
of
road
access
and
the
only
thing
that
i
could
think
of
that
the
mechanical
means
is
would
be
helicopters
or
maybe
some
other
kind
of
airplanes.
i
am
told
that
it
is
possible
to
construct
roads
through
here,
which
however
would
be
much
longer
and
would
involve
greater
injury
to
public
land,
though
not
the
national
park.
certainly
the
problem
with
which
your
question
is
directed
mr.
justice
has
been
considered
by
the
department.
let
me
say
just
one
more
thing.
there
is
some
confusions
where
which
we
are
to
blame
about
the
difference
between
this
appendix
in
our
brief
of
a
proposed
permit
being
different
from
the
one
in
the
ninth
circuit.
it
was
not
intended
to
be.
it
is
intended
to
be
the
same
permit,
but
when
it
got
to
our
office,
a
member
of
my
staff
found
that
there
were
two
paragraph
17,
so
he
proceeded
to
renumber
the
subsequent
paragraphs
and
that
naturally
is
confusing,
but
this
is
essentially
the
same
permit
as
was
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals.

there
