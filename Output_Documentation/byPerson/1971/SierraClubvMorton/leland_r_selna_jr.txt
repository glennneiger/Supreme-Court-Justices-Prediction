mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
burger
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
sierra
club
brought
this
proceeding
against
the
secretaries
of
agriculture
and
interior
and
their
assistants
to
establish
that
their
plans
to
authorize
a
huge
private
recreational
development
at
mineral
king
in
sequoia
national
game
refuge
and
for
a
state
highway
across
sequoia
national
park
to
reach
that
development
are
--
were
illegal.
the
club
argued
that
unless
temporarily
enjoined,
the
implementation
of
those
plans,
would
cause
a
irreparable
harm
to
the
special
conversation
interests
of
the
club
and
to
the
public.
the
district
court
after
two
days
of
hearings
granted
a
preliminary
injunction.
the
government
appealed
and
the
ninth
circuit
reversed,
denying
the
club
standing
and
then
finding
district
court
error
in
upholding
the
club
on
the
merits.
the
order
dissolving
the
injunction
has
been
stayed
pending
the
outcome
of
this
case
and
this
court
granted
the
club's
petition
for
certiorari
on
february
22,
1971.
the
case
presents
several
key
issues,
including
first,
whether
the
sierra
club
may
have
standing
for
itself
and
the
public
to
challenge
violations
of
laws
which
would
injure
its
long
held
aesthetic
and
conservational
interests
in
mineral
king
and
sequoia
national
park.
second,
whether
the
secretary
of
the
interior
may
permit
the
state
of
california
to
build
and
operate
a
new
connecting
link
freeway
across
sequoia
national
park
when
it
serves
no
park
purpose.
third,
whether
congress
has
limited
the
size
of
long
term
developments
in
national
forests,
say
to
80
acres.
fourth,
whether
the
secretary
of
agriculture
may
authorize
a
huge
recreational
development
in
a
game
refuge.
mineral
king
is
located
in
the
sierra
nevada
mountains,
approximately
225
miles
north
of
los
angeles.
it
is
a
portion
of
the
15,000
acre
game
refuge
which
congress
created
in
1926.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
the
area
that
is
in
white
is
15,000
acres,
sequoia
national
park
surrounds
it
on
the
three
sides.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
no
it
is
not
mr.
chief
justice.
it
is
a
game
refuge
and
it
is
part
of
sequoia
national
forest,
but
it
has
a
special
status
which
we
will
come
to.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
the
road
--
the
smaller
road
is
an
existing
road.
the
road
that
is
in
heavier
mark
is
that
which
is
proposed
to
connect
the
state
highway
here
across
sequoia
national
park
here,
dead
end
of
mineral
king
here.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
that
is
correct.
walt
disney
productions
has
described
mineral
king
and
i
am
quoting
from
the
appendix
at
page
53a.
“as
unsurpassed
in
natural
splendor,
perhaps
more
similar
to
the
european
alps
than
any
other
area
in
the
united
states
and
generously
endowed
with
lakes,
streams,
cascades,
caverns
and
matchless
mountain
visitors.
in
1969,
the
forest
service
accepted
a
proposal
from
disney
for
a
huge
resort
development
at
mineral
king.
disney
would
construct
hotels,
lodges,
restaurants,
other
permanent
facilities,
so
the
14,000
persons
could
ski
at
mineral
king
at
one
time.
some
of
those
permanent
features,
including
ski
lifts,
parking
and
sewage
disposal
facilities
and
roads,
among
other
things,
would
not
fit
on
the
80
acres
which
is
the
limit
of
agriculture's
term
authority
under
16
u.s.code
section
497.
the
district
court
found
that
up
to
1,000
acres
would
be
occupied
and
affected
by
the
development.
agriculture
plan
to
get
around
that
limit
of
497
by
issuing
a
second
interlocking
permit
relying
on
16
u.s.
code,
section
551,
which
authorizes
him
to
make
rules
and
regulations
for
the
national
forests.
now,
the
road
that
we
spoke
off
that
is
in
existence
is
only
partially
paved.
it
was
in
existence
when
the
park
was
created
and
has
served
mineral
king
for
90
years.
to
solve
the
problem
of
transporting
14,000
persons
at
one
time
to
mineral
king
was
the
--
was
a
problem.
and
the
state
of
california
agreed
to
construct
a
high
standard
freeway
to
dead
end
at
mineral
king
provided
that
it
could
cut
across
the
park.
the
state
rejected
other
avenues
as
longer
and
more
costly.
the
secretary
of
the
interior
finally
acquiesced
in
the
highway,
although
it
would
not
serve
a
park
purpose.
he
also
was
prepared
to
issue
a
permit
for
a
high
voltage
transmission
line
across
the
park
to
serve
mineral
king.
sierra
club
has
worked
to
preserve
the
lands
of
sequoia
national
park
and
mineral
king
since
its
founding.
it
helped
draw
the
boundary
lines
and
to
work
out
the
compromise
which
established
the
game
refuge
in
1926.
as
at
incident
of
the
club's
interest
in
the
area
some
of
these
members
used
mineral
king.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
mr.
justice
blackmun,
the
record
contains
a
letter
which
is
written
by
a
member
of
the
board
of
directors
of
the
sierra
club
in
which
he
in
turn
refers
to
his
trip
to
mineral
king.
the
public
record
which
is
referred
to
at
page
30
of
our
brief,
in
footnote
3
refers
to
testimony
in
1920
before
the
house
committee
on
public
lands
in
which
steven
maker,
director
of
the
park
service
refers
down
about
halfway
in
the
footnote,
“the
sierra
club
members
probably
know
that
area
better
than
now
than
any
other
living
people.
they
go
there
nearly
every
year,
a
club
of
about
2,000
members
and
they
know
every
nook
and
corner
of
it.”
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
direct
testimony
concerning
their
use
mr.
chief
--mr.
justice
blackmun,
no
there
is
not.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
yes
it
does.
commencing
in
1965,
the
club
sought
public
hearings
to
challenge
the
project
which
threatened
to
seriously
impair
its
conservation
program
and
to
harm
the
public
interest
in
conserving
these
special
lands.
but
the
secretary
of
agriculture
refused
to
conduct
those
hearings
and
without
them
he
promised
to
sue,
he
promised
to
issue
the
two
interlocking
permits
to
disney.
those
permits
were
to
become
effective
when
the
state
of
california
let
a
contract
for
highway
construction
and
with
those
permits
disney
would
have
commence
the
bulldozing
and
earth
moving
which
would
have
cause
the
re
--
irreversible
change
at
mineral
king.
the
secretary
of
interior
was
about
to
issue
that
highway
permit
which
would
have
triggered
the
entire
project
when
the
sierra
club
filed
this
action.
we
first
argued
that
the
sierra
club
had
standing
to
sue.
our
success
on
this
issue
though
without
more
would
leave
unresolved
significant
national
questions
of
public
land
management.
it
also
would
leave
intact
the
ninth
circuit’s
predisposition
of
the
merits
in
this
case.
we
therefore
argue
that
the
highway
across
the
park
and
the
disney
development
would
be
illegal.
we
will
not
argue
orally
concerning
the
failure
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
conduct
hearings
on
the
park
highway
concerning
the
transmission
line
across
the
park
and
concerning
the
standards
applied
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
dissolving
the
preliminary
injunction.
these
matters
have
been
fully
briefed.
this
court
decided
in
the
data
processing
case
in
1970
that
aggrievement
to
a
aesthetic
conversation
and
recreation
was
well
of
economic
values
could
sustain
the
standing.
the
court
in
that
case
cited
the
scenic
hudson
preservation
conference
and
office
of
communication
of
the
united
church
of
christ
cases.
those
were
cases
in
which
organizations,
aesthetic
for
a
conservational
or
recreational
interests
were
sufficiently
aggrieved,
to
permit
them
to
represent
the
public
interest.
the
case
is
very
comparable
with
this.
this
court
this
year
granted
the
sierra
club
standing
in
taking
jurisdiction
of
the
citizens
to
preserve
overton
park
versus
volpe
case
to
enforce
the
conservational
purposes
of
federal
highway
8
statutes.
all
of
these
cases
confirm
the
sierra
club’s
standing
here.
the
club
meets
the
standing
tests
of
data
processing.
it
provides
a
more
than
adequate
assurance
of
concrete
adversity.
the
club
would
be
aggrieved
or
injured
in
fact
by
the
threatened
acts
against
its
conservational
interests
in
these
lands.
i
have
referred
to
its
long-term
efforts
and
it
--
to
it
and
it
has
had
a
long-term
program
to
preserve
these
lands
for
educational
programs,
writings
and
advocacy
which
would
have
been
impaired
if
the
development
had
occurred
–
had
occurred.
at
the
same
time
the
development
threatened
the
public's
interest
in
preserving
our
natural
resources
for
pub
--
present
and
the
future
generations.
the
club
was
within
the
zone
of
interests
of
the
relevant
statutes.
we
will
see
that
16
u.s.
code,
section
1
protects
sequoia
national
park
in
its
present
state,
in
its
natural
state.
section
497
protects
the
national
forest
against
to
over
development.
section
688
protects
wildlife
and
its
habitat
in
the
game
refuge.
all
of
these
are
conservation
statutes.
all
of
them
protect
the
public
interest
which
is
shared
by
the
club.
third,
none
of
these
statutes
precludes
judicial
review.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
it
is
over
70
years
old.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
it
had,
at
the
time
the
action
was
filed,
i
believe
that
at
this
time
they
are
over
a
hundred
thousand
members.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
the
question
of
anybody’s
standing,
mr.
justice
brennan,
all
it
be
an
evaluation
that
the
court
would
link,
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice
stewart,
would
ought
to
be
an
evaluation
which
any
--
which
the
court
would
have
to
make
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
a
variety
of
criteria
and
might
be
appropriate
as
the
--
has
organization
been
in
existence
and
has
it
taken
a
stand
over
an
unextended
period
of
time
that
is
consistent
with
its
stand,
has
not
done
anything
which
--
gives
its
special
expertise
in
the
area
that
arises
to
argue
about?
does
it
have
an
educational
program,
does
is
it
write
on
the
subject,
does
not
do
its
members
use
the
area,
is
it
adequately
staffed
so
that
it
can
present
a
case
in
a
way
that
a
court
can
understand.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
mr.
justice
stewart
it
is
a
--
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
no
mr.
justice
stewart
but
if
the
concern
as
i
understand
it
ought
to
be
is
that
the
court
be
assured
that
a
case
or
controversy
is
presented
then
while
an
exhausted
trial
should
not
be
necessary
or
an
exhausted
litigation
of
the
quality
of
the
club’s
position
should
not
be
necessary.
there
are
of
these
criteria
which
i
think
rather
quickly
and
rather
easily
could
be
determined
by
the
court.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
it
is
conceivable
that
they
could.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
yes.
mr.
chief
justice
and
--
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
we
do.
we
do
and
then
--
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
except
to
the
extent
that
if
the
question
is
to
whether
it
was
truly
representative
might
be
reflected
in
its
age
and--
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
and
the
truly
representative
him.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
yes
it
does,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
mr.
justice
stewart
i
think
that
he
could.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
could
do
it.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
am
not
at
this
moment
familiar
with
--
whether
the
sierra
club
has
a
chapter
or
an
expertise
in
that
area.
i
would
have
to
consult
with
the
club
before
i
could
answer
your
question.
but
it
would
have
to
have
competence
in
the
area
in
which
it
sought
to
represent
the
public
interest
or
it
would
not
be
able
to
do
it.
now,
the
ninth
circuit
denied
standing
in
this
case
because
and
i
quote
from
its
opinion,
“the
club
had
not
asserted
that
any
of
its
property
will
be
damaged.
that
its
organization
and
members
will
be
in
danger
or
that
its
will
threatened.”
that
is
at
the
appendix
at
page
217.
these
injuries
to
property,
organization
and
status
have
nothing
to
do
with
aesthetic,
conservational,
recreational
of
values.
they
are
not
redressable
under
a
conservation
statute
because
while
the
litigant
beautifully
satisfies
the
first
test
of
data
processing,
he
is
injured
in
fact,
he
is
not
covered
by
the
conservation
purposes
of
the
statute.
and
he
is
outside
his
zone
of
interest.
now,
because
the
sierra
club
represents
not
only
itself
but
the
public
interests,
the
government
is
wrong
in
its
argument
that
injury
to
the
public
demands
a
special
statutory
grant
of
--
in
order
to
permit
standing.
but
data
processing
case
already
answered
that
argument
when
it
recognized
that
widely
held
aesthetic
conservational
and
recreational
values
which
by
their
nature
affect
the
public
could
be
a
basis
for
standing.
its
zone
of
interest
in
reviewability
test
apply
only
to
cases
where
no
special
statute
confers
standing
and
the
fact
that
the
interest
to
group
is
broad,
does
not
bar
standing
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
flast
versus
cohen
in
1968
and
baker
versus
carr
in
1962.
on
the
contrary
it
is
because
the
club
represents
the
public
interest
that
any
questions
regarding
standing
should
be
resolved
in
its
favor
because
in
these
cases,
conservationist
organizations
maybe
the
only
people
who
will
step
forward
to
challenge
the
illegal
acts.
the
sierra
club
does
not
seek
to
review
authority
over
the
exercise
of
the
--
it
does
not
seek
to
have
its
own
review
authority
over
the
exercise
of
the
administrative
discretion.
it
asks
the
court
to
do
that
in
which
it
is
expert,
namely
to
decide
whether
the
federal
administrator
stepped
outside
the
bounds
of
their
statutory
authority.
that
view
should
not
be
barred
if
the
courthouse
do
it.
we
argue
that
the
disney
development
at
the
mineral
king
would
be
illegal
on
several
grounds,
but
in
any
event
the
proposed
new
high
speed
access
highway
across
the
sequoia
national
park
is
independently
illegal.
congress
has
expressly
protected
these
parks
in
their
natural
state
and
has
severely
limited
the
use
of
park
land.
the
organic
act
of
1916,
which
established
the
national
park
service,
included
section
16
u.s.
code,
section
1,
as
quoted
at
page
66
of
our
brief.
that
section
permits
the
use
of
parks
only
and
i
quote,
“by
such
means
and
measures
as
conform
to
the
fundamental
purposes
of
said
parks,
monuments
and
reservations
which
purposes
to
conserve
the
scenery,
the
natural
and
historic
objects
and
the
wildlife
therein
and
to
provide
for
the
enjoinment
of
that
the
same
in
such
a
manner
and
by
such
means
as
will
leave
them
unimpaired
for
the
enjoyment
of
future
generations.
this
statute
requires
that
any
changes
in
parks
from
their
natural
state
must
be
in
conformity
with
the
park
purpose.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
there
is
a
road
which
is
the
state
highway
that
traverses
sequoia
national
park
and
serves
the
purpose
of
providing
access
to
the
park.
there
is
the
mineral
king
road
which
existed
prior
to
the
existence
of
the
park.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
parallels
it,
but
on
an
entirely
different
route.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
mr.
justice
blackmun,
in
fact
there
are
private
in-holdings
in
mineral
king.
in
fact
this
is
an
instance
where
it
is
conceivable
that
there
are
people
who
--
individuals
who
would
have
an
injury
of
a
type
that
would
cause
them
in
theory
to
step
forward.
they
are
practical
limitations
on
their
doing
it.
one
is
that
often
people
in
this
in-holdings
are
benefited
economically
by
the
development
that
is
about
to
occur
and
any
aesthetic
impulse
they
had
is
overpowered
by
the
contrary
economic
impulse.
in
many
instances
and
in
the
case
of
sequoia
national
park
itself
--
it
is
a
good
example,
they
are
users
in
the
sense
of
people
who
have
private
in-holdings
that
would
be
affected
one
way
or
the
other
by
the
development.
so
in
answer
to
your
question,
if
not
the
sierra
club,
in
many
instances
nobody
or
if
not
an
environmental
organization,
nobody.
mr.
leland

yes,
there
are.
mr.

many
years.
mr.

now
in
order
to
give
the
highway
a
park
purpose
the
government
argues
now
that
to
see
--
that
mineral
king
really
is
part
of
the
park
at
--
that
the
statute
is
clear
that
congress
did
not
include
mineral
king
in
the
park
but
if
it
had
there
would
be
no
need
for
the
highway
because
the
disney
development
could
not
be
built
in
sequoia
national
park.
in
that
park,
16
u.s.
code,
section
45
(b)
which
is
set
forth
at
page
16
of
our
reply
brief,
barred
the
use
of
more
than
ten
acres
for
more
than
20
years
for
this
type
development.
disney’s
development
violates
both
the
space
and
time
limitations
of
that
section.
the
government
urges
us
to
disregard
all
of
these
statutes
because
the
secretary
of
the
interior
ought
to
be
able
to
cooperate
in
such
a
ways
to
provide
access
to
something
that
is
legal
outside
the
park.
in
the
first
place,
the
route
across
sequoia
national
park
is
not
the
only
available
route
of
access
to
mineral
king,
but
if
it
were
this
argument
must
fail.
it
would
permit
interior
to
disregard
all
limits
on
its
power
as
long
as
he
was
acting
in
aid
of
another
governmental
official.
nor
is
the
fact
that
there
is
a
road
in
existence,
a
legalizing
effect
for
the
proposed
new
highway.
a
new
highway
would
be
huge
by
contrast,
would
be
on
a
different
route,
with
new
cuts,
fills
and
structures
and
the
record
shows
that
its
effect
would
be
wipe
out
220
acres
of
virgin
park
land
to
endanger
sequoia
trees
and
to
create
a
barrier
for
the
3,000
man
and
wildlife.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
this
from
--
this
from
the
state
highway
to
mineral
king
is
approximately
25
miles.
that
highway
in
distance
across
sequoia
national
park
is
approximately
9
miles.
concerning
mineral
king
itself,
agriculture
would
not
have
authority
to
allow
it
even
if
it
were
ordinary
national
forest
land
which
it
is
not.
16
u.s.
code,
section
497
permits
the
term
use
of
only
80
acres
of
that
land
for
recreational
purposes.
the
disney
development
at
mineral
king
is
so
large
that
it
is
spills
over
those
80
acres
and
its
permanent
facilities
extend
beyond
them.
the
secretary
of
agriculture’s
attempt
to
get
around
497
by
issuing
a
second
permit
for
indispensable
acreage
violates
that
law.
16
u.s.
code,
section
551
is
not
authority
for
the
expanded
term
used.
that
statute
as
this
court
found
in
united
states
v.
grimaud
in
1911,
delegates
congress
power
only
over
administrative
detail.
it
is
not
the
necessary
express
delegation
of
power
to
transfer
term
interests
in
federal
land.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
mr.
justice
blackmun,
it
is
been
used
widely
for
permits
which
the
government
has
represented
in
every
case
were
terminable
at
will
and
those
permits
had
been
for
structures
in
many
instances.
but
in
every
instance
the
government
has
said,
we
are
in
a
position
to
take
this
--
the
usual
way
immediately
and
restore
the
public's
right
in
that
land.
the
fatal
difference,
the
difference
here
is
that
the
term
use
is
set
for
30
years
under
the
80
acre
permit
and
the
other
uses
are
absolutely
indispensable
to
the
use
that
is
made
on
the
80
acres
and
it
results
in
a
tie-in
together
other
uses
which
is
one
for
a
permit
for
a
period
of
30
years
for
acreage
exceeding
80.
the
government
correctly
argues,
section
497
previously
had
a
five
acre
limitation
and
that
was
amended
in
1956.
the
government
correctly
argues
that
the
motivation
of
those
who
wanted
to
expand
five
acres
to
80
acres
was
to
obtain
certainty
of
tenure
and
increase
financial
support
for
larger
developments.
but
this
explanation
is
of
what
happened
in
1956
is
incomplete
because
it
considers
only
the
goals
of
those
who
sought
relief
from
the
5
acre
limit
while
disregarding
the
reasons
for
any
acreage
limitation
at
all.
congress
was
concerned
over
the
adverse
effects
of
large
developments
on
national
forest
lands.
the
forest
service
told
congress
that
80
acres
was
necessary
in
order
to
include
all
the
facilities
in
modern
developments,
including
ski
lifts.
it
calmed
congress'
fears
by
saying
that
80
acres
was
the
maximum
limit.
this
is
set
forth
in
our
reply
brief
at
page
11,
footnote
25.
congress
did
not
make
the
amendment
which
could
have
been
in
order,
certainty
if
tenure
had
been
its
only
concern.
it
did
not
just
wipe
out
the
five
acre
limit.
instead
it
set
up
a
new
limit
80
acres.
in
the
entire
history
of
this
case
no
one
has
explained
the
purpose
of
that
limitation
if
not
to
restrict
developments
to
80
acres.
and
when
he
was
campaigning
for
relief
from
the
five-acre
limitation,
the
secretary
of
agriculture
did
reveal
that
he
had
used
combined
permits
to
get
around
the
five-acre
limit.
he
did
not
say
that
any
of
these
combined
permits
exceeded
80-acres.
a
key
to
this
matter
is
as
if
he
was
not
seeking
to
have
congress
ratify
his
practice
of
combining
permits,
rather
he
was
representing
that
if
he
could
grant
permits
for
up
to
80-acres
the
practice
would
be
discontinued.
the
ninth
circuit
erroneously
decided
that
the
interlocking
supplemental
permit
to
be
used
in
this
case
need
not
be
terminable
at
will.
several
attorneys-general,
including
harlan
fiske
stone
have
said
otherwise.
the
government
admits
at
page
48
of
its
brief,
the
supplemental
permit
is
essential
to
the
viability
of
the
project,
it
is
correct.
revocation
would
destroy
the
$35
million
disney
investment
a
major
portion
of
which
will
be
--
within
80
acres.
the
terrific
impact
on
mineral
king
of
this
development
would
make
it
impossible
to
restore
it
to
its
natural
state.
the
supplemental
term
from
--
supplemental
permit
is
not
even
technically
reputable.
now,
the
government
has
said
if
the
court
finds
that
all
of
this
is
illegal
--
it
will
affect
84
existing
ski
resorts.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
it
need
not
do
that.
this
is
not
a
consistent
administrative
practice.
some
regional
foresters
have
used
the
practice
and
others
have
rejected
it
and
in
any
event
there
is
no
general
department
policy
or
regulation
on
the
subject.
these
illegal
acts
do
not
legalize
mineral
king
and
they
do
not
require
this
court
to
choose
between
closing
them
down
and
making
mineral
king
legal.
the
court
may
--
make
the
operation
of
its
order
in
this
case
perspective
only.
now,
the
disney
development
is
illegal
as
it
stands
on
a
national
forest,
but
it
is
doubly
illegal
because
it
was
attempted
to
be
placed
on
a
game
refuge.
in
1926
when
it
created
that
game
refuge,
congress
said
that
its
purpose
was
to
protect
from
trespass,
the
public
lands
of
the
refuge
and
the
game
animals
that
may
be
on
it,
which
maybe
they
are
on,
is
the
language
of
the
statute.
the
impact
of
the
disney’s
develop
--
of
the
disney
development
on
the
games
habitat
would
be
enormous.
california
fishing
game
commission
personnel
have
stated
that
in
an
extensive
development
and
i
am
reading
from
our
appendix
at
page
30,
“that
in
an
extensive
development
such
as
the
disney
proposal,
considerable
wildlife
habitat
would
be
lost
and
wildlife
would
suffer
from
human
encroachment.”
the
secretary
has
made
no
finding
on
this
subject.
if
he
had,
the
finding
would
have
shown
that
he
abused
his
discretion.
we
previously
have
argued
that
the
refuge
is
not
in
sequoia
national
park
and
that
whatever
practice
there
maybe
on
national
parks
in
regard
to
ski
resorts
does
not
legalize
it
at
mineral
king.
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
in
looking
at
the
merits
this
court
will
find
that
both
the
issue
of
the
legality
of
the
highway
in
the
national
park
and
the
legality
of
the
term
permits
or
combining
of
permits
to
exceed
80
acres
are
such
that
they
could
indeed
and
finally
decided
in
this
court.
turning
to
the
question
of
standing,
it
should
be
clear
from
our
argument
that
we
do
not
urge
that
the
doors
of
courts
be
opened
wide
to
anyone.
we
have
argued
that
there
are
criteria
which
should
be
applied
by
a
court
and
by
which
the
organizations
or
individual’s
qualifications
for
standing
should
be
tested.
the
club
in
this
case
did
in
fact
allege
its
special
interest
in
the
area
involved
and
in
this
area
i
have
noticed
pleading,
no
one
in
california
at
the
district
court
level
had
any
question
in
their
mind
as
to
the
deep
involvement
of
the
club
with
sequoia
national
park
and
mineral
king,
so
that
a
case
or
controversy
would
be
assured.
now,
the
solicitor
general
has
made
reference
to
the
reply
brief
and
to
our
reply
brief
in
dealing
with
the
matter
of
the
club’s
use
of
the
area
in
question.
it
is
true
that
the
sierra
club
for
a
number
of
years
has
run
pack
trips
in
mineral
king
and
it
is
also
true
that
is
specific
indicator
of
its
interest
in
the
area
was
not
part
of
the
allegations
of
the
complaint.
those
pack
trips
that
are
non-profit
activity
and
they
are
not
for
any
private
purpose.
their
purpose
is
to
acquaint
people
with
the
national
features
of
the
area
so
that
they
in
turn
will
be
workers
that
would
help
to
preserve
it.
any
interference,
which
the
disney
plan
would
have
with
those
pack
trips
would
not
have
been
of
sufficient
importance
to
this
club
to
undertake
the
litigation
that
it
has
ensued
here
and
because
of
those
pack
trips,
though
they
are
non-profit
and
though
they
are
in
furthering
service,
interest
in
the
area
could
have
been
misunderstood
as
an
economically
oriented
or
other
private
interest
not
directly
related
to
the
public
interest.
they
were
not
alleged.
now,
concerning
whether
the
courts
will
be
inundated
by
the
granting
of
standing
in
a
case
such
as
this,
i
should
only
say
that
the
experience
which
many,
many
cases
we
have
eluded
to
has
been
not
to
purport
--
inundated
it
all,
but
that
the
number
of
lawsuits
brought
by
environmentalists
and
conservationists
groups
has
been
significantly
limited
by
the
practicalities
and
the
realities
of
carrying
out
litigation
of
this
type.
now,
concerning
injury,
it
is
true
that
injury
to
aesthetic
and
conservational
and
recreational
values
is
different
in
kind
than
an
injury
to
a
voter’s
rights
or
an
injury
to
a
tax
payer’s
rights.
it
is
nevertheless
a
concrete
injury
and
it
should
serve
everybody
strongly.
as
this
court
has
already
noted
in
the
data
processing
case
as
a
basis
for
statutory
agreement,
aggrievement
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
as
those
other
types
of
injury.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
burger
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
sierra
club
brought
this
proceeding
against
the
secretaries
of
agriculture
and
interior
and
their
assistants
to
establish
that
their
plans
to
authorize
a
huge
private
recreational
development
at
mineral
king
in
sequoia
national
game
refuge
and
for
a
state
highway
across
sequoia
national
park
to
reach
that
development
are
--
were
illegal.
the
club
argued
that
unless
temporarily
enjoined,
the
implementation
of
those
plans,
would
cause
a
irreparable
harm
to
the
special
conversation
interests
of
the
club
and
to
the
public.
the
district
court
after
two
days
of
hearings
granted
a
preliminary
injunction.
the
government
appealed
and
the
ninth
circuit
reversed,
denying
the
club
standing
and
then
finding
district
court
error
in
upholding
the
club
on
the
merits.
the
order
dissolving
the
injunction
has
been
stayed
pending
the
outcome
of
this
case
and
this
court
granted
the
club's
petition
for
certiorari
on
february
22,
1971.
the
case
presents
several
key
issues,
including
first,
whether
the
sierra
club
may
have
standing
for
itself
and
the
public
to
challenge
violations
of
laws
which
would
injure
its
long
held
aesthetic
and
conservational
interests
in
mineral
king
and
sequoia
national
park.
second,
whether
the
secretary
of
the
interior
may
permit
the
state
of
california
to
build
and
operate
a
new
connecting
link
freeway
across
sequoia
national
park
when
it
serves
no
park
purpose.
third,
whether
congress
has
limited
the
size
of
long
term
developments
in
national
forests,
say
to
80
acres.
fourth,
whether
the
secretary
of
agriculture
may
authorize
a
huge
recreational
development
in
a
game
refuge.
mineral
king
is
located
in
the
sierra
nevada
mountains,
approximately
225
miles
north
of
los
angeles.
it
is
a
portion
of
the
15,000
acre
game
refuge
which
congress
created
in
1926.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
the
area
that
is
in
white
is
15,000
acres,
sequoia
national
park
surrounds
it
on
the
three
sides.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
no
it
is
not
mr.
chief
justice.
it
is
a
game
refuge
and
it
is
part
of
sequoia
national
forest,
but
it
has
a
special
status
which
we
will
come
to.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
the
road
--
the
smaller
road
is
an
existing
road.
the
road
that
is
in
heavier
mark
is
that
which
is
proposed
to
connect
the
state
highway
here
across
sequoia
national
park
here,
dead
end
of
mineral
king
here.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
that
is
correct.
walt
disney
productions
has
described
mineral
king
and
i
am
quoting
from
the
appendix
at
page
53a.
“as
unsurpassed
in
natural
splendor,
perhaps
more
similar
to
the
european
alps
than
any
other
area
in
the
united
states
and
generously
endowed
with
lakes,
streams,
cascades,
caverns
and
matchless
mountain
visitors.
in
1969,
the
forest
service
accepted
a
proposal
from
disney
for
a
huge
resort
development
at
mineral
king.
disney
would
construct
hotels,
lodges,
restaurants,
other
permanent
facilities,
so
the
14,000
persons
could
ski
at
mineral
king
at
one
time.
some
of
those
permanent
features,
including
ski
lifts,
parking
and
sewage
disposal
facilities
and
roads,
among
other
things,
would
not
fit
on
the
80
acres
which
is
the
limit
of
agriculture's
term
authority
under
16
u.s.code
section
497.
the
district
court
found
that
up
to
1,000
acres
would
be
occupied
and
affected
by
the
development.
agriculture
plan
to
get
around
that
limit
of
497
by
issuing
a
second
interlocking
permit
relying
on
16
u.s.
code,
section
551,
which
authorizes
him
to
make
rules
and
regulations
for
the
national
forests.
now,
the
road
that
we

served

for
90
years.
to
solve
the
problem
of
transporting
14,000
persons
at
one
time
to
mineral
king
was
the
--
was
a
problem.
and
the
state
of

agreed
to
construct
a
high
standard
freeway
to
dead
end
at
mineral
king
provided
that
it
could
cut
across
the
park.
the
state
rejected
other
avenues
as
longer
and
more
costly.
the
secretary
of
the
interior
finally
acquiesced
in
the
highway,

it
would

was

sierra
club
has
worked
to
preserve
the
lands
of
sequoia
national
park
and
mineral
king
since
its
founding.
it
helped
draw
the
boundary

and
to
work
out

compromise
which
established

refuge
in
1926.
as
at
incident
of
the
club's
interest
in
the
area
some
of
these
members
used
mineral
king.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
mr.
justice
blackmun,
the
record
contains
a
letter
which
is
written
by
a
member
of
the
board
of
directors
of
the
sierra
club
in
which
he
in
turn
refers
to
his
trip
to
mineral
king.
the
public
record
which
is
referred
to
at
page
30
of
our
brief,
in
footnote
3
refers
to
testimony
in
1920
before
the
house
committee
on
public
lands
in
which
steven
maker,
director
of
the
park
service
refers
down
about
halfway
in
the
footnote,
“the
sierra
club
members
probably
know
that
area
better
than
now
than
any
other
living
people.
they
go
there
nearly
every
year,
a
club
of
about
2,000
members
and
they
know
every
nook
and
corner
of
it.”
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
direct
testimony
concerning
their
use
mr.
chief
--mr.
justice
blackmun,
no
there
is
not.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
yes
it
does.
commencing
in
1965,
the
club
sought
public
hearings
to
challenge
the
project
which
threatened
to
seriously
impair
its
conservation
program
and
to
harm
the
public
interest
in
conserving
these
special
lands.
but
the
secretary
of
agriculture
refused
to
conduct
those
hearings
and
without
them
he
promised
to
sue,
he
promised
to
issue
the
two
interlocking
permits
to
disney.
those
permits
were
to
become
effective
when
the
state
of
california
let
a
contract
for
highway
construction
and
with
those
permits
disney
would
have
commence
the
bulldozing
and
earth
moving
which
would
have
cause
the
re
--
irreversible
change
at
mineral
king.
the
secretary
of
interior
was
about
to
issue
that
highway
permit
which
would
have
triggered
the
entire
project
when
the
sierra
club
filed
this
action.
we
first
argued
that
the
sierra
club
had
standing
to
sue.
our
success
on
this
issue
though
without
more
would
leave
unresolved
significant
national
questions
of
public
land
management.
it
also
would
leave
intact
the
ninth
circuit’s
predisposition
of
the
merits
in
this
case.
we
therefore
argue
that
the
highway
across
the
park
and
the
disney
development
would
be
illegal.
we
will
not
argue
orally
concerning
the
failure
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
conduct
hearings
on
the
park
highway
concerning
the
transmission
line
across
the
park
and
concerning
the
standards
applied
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
dissolving
the
preliminary
injunction.
these
matters
have
been
fully
briefed.
this
court
decided
in
the
data
processing
case
in
1970
that
aggrievement
to
a
aesthetic
conversation
and
recreation
was
well
of
economic
values
could
sustain
the
standing.
the
court
in
that
case
cited
the
scenic
hudson
preservation
conference
and
office
of
communication
of
the
united
church
of
christ
cases.
those
were
cases
in
which
organizations,
aesthetic
for
a
conservational
or
recreational
interests
were
sufficiently
aggrieved,
to
permit
them
to
represent
the
public
interest.
the
case
is
very
comparable
with
this.
this
court
this
year
granted
the
sierra
club
standing
in
taking
jurisdiction
of
the
citizens
to
preserve
overton
park
versus
volpe
case
to
enforce
the
conservational
purposes
of
federal
highway
8
statutes.
all
of
these
cases
confirm
the
sierra
club’s
standing
here.
the
club
meets
the
standing
tests
of
data
processing.
it
provides
a
more
than
adequate
assurance
of
concrete
adversity.
the
club
would
be
aggrieved
or
injured
in
fact
by
the
threatened
acts
against
its
conservational
interests
in
these
lands.
i
have
referred
to
its
long-term
efforts
and
it
--
to
it
and
it
has
had
a
long-term
program
to
preserve
these
lands
for
educational
programs,
writings
and
advocacy
which
would
have
been
impaired
if
the
development
had
occurred
–
had
occurred.
at
the
same
time
the
development
threatened
the
public's
interest
in
preserving
our
natural
resources
for
pub
--
present
and
the
future
generations.
the
club
was
within
the
zone
of
interests
of
the
relevant
statutes.
we
will
see
that
16
u.s.
code,
section
1
protects
sequoia
national
park
in
its
present
state,
in
its
natural
state.
section
497
protects
the
national
forest
against
to
over
development.
section
688
protects
wildlife
and
its
habitat
in
the
game
refuge.
all
of
these
are
conservation
statutes.
all
of
them
protect
the
public
interest
which
is
shared
by
the
club.
third,
none
of
these
statutes
precludes
judicial
review.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
it
is
over
70
years
old.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
it
had,
at
the
time
the
action
was
filed,
i
believe
that
at
this
time
they
are
over
a
hundred
thousand
members.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
the
question
of
anybody’s
standing,
mr.
justice
brennan,
all
it
be
an
evaluation
that
the
court
would
link,
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice
stewart,
would
ought
to
be
an
evaluation
which
any
--
which
the
court
would
have
to
make
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
a
variety
of
criteria
and
might
be
appropriate
as
the
--
has
organization
been
in
existence
and
has
it
taken
a
stand
over
an
unextended
period
of
time
that
is
consistent
with
its
stand,
has
not
done
anything
which
--
gives
its
special
expertise
in
the
area
that
arises
to
argue
about?
does
it
have
an
educational
program,
does
is
it
write
on
the
subject,
does
not
do
its
members
use
the
area,
is
it
adequately
staffed
so
that
it
can
present
a
case
in
a
way
that
a
court
can
understand.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
mr.
justice
stewart
it
is
a
--
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
no
mr.
justice
stewart
but
if
the
concern
as
i
understand
it
ought
to
be
is
that
the
court
be
assured
that
a
case
or
controversy
is
presented
then
while
an
exhausted
trial
should
not
be
necessary
or
an
exhausted
litigation
of
the
quality
of
the
club’s
position
should
not
be
necessary.
there
are
of
these
criteria
which
i
think
rather
quickly
and
rather
easily
could
be
determined
by
the
court.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
it
is
conceivable
that
they
could.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
yes.
mr.
chief
justice
and
--
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
we
do.
we
do
and
then
--
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
except
to
the
extent
that
if
the
question
is
to
whether
it
was
truly
representative
might
be
reflected
in
its
age
and--
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
and
the
truly
representative
him.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
yes
it
does,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
mr.
justice
stewart
i
think
that
he
could.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
could
do
it.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
am
not
at
this
moment
familiar
with
--
whether
the
sierra
club
has
a
chapter
or
an
expertise
in
that
area.
i
would
have
to
consult
with
the
club
before
i
could
answer
your
question.
but
it
would
have
to
have
competence
in
the
area
in
which
it
sought
to
represent
the
public
interest
or
it
would
not
be
able
to
do
it.
now,
the
ninth
circuit
denied
standing
in
this
case
because
and
i
quote
from
its
opinion,
“the
club
had
not
asserted
that
any
of
its
property
will
be
damaged.
that
its
organization
and
members
will
be
in
danger
or
that
its
will
threatened.”
that
is
at
the
appendix
at
page
217.
these
injuries
to
property,
organization
and
status
have
nothing
to
do
with
aesthetic,
conservational,
recreational
of
values.
they
are
not
redressable
under
a
conservation
statute
because
while
the
litigant
beautifully
satisfies
the
first
test
of
data
processing,
he
is
injured
in
fact,
he
is
not
covered
by
the
conservation
purposes
of
the
statute.
and
he
is
outside
his
zone
of
interest.
now,
because
the
sierra
club
represents
not
only
itself
but
the
public
interests,
the
government
is
wrong
in
its
argument
that
injury
to
the
public
demands
a
special
statutory
grant
of
--
in
order
to
permit
standing.
but
data
processing
case
already
answered
that
argument
when
it
recognized
that
widely
held
aesthetic
conservational
and
recreational
values
which
by
their
nature
affect
the
public
could
be
a
basis
for
standing.
its
zone
of
interest
in
reviewability
test
apply
only
to
cases
where
no
special
statute
confers
standing
and
the
fact
that
the
interest
to
group
is
broad,
does
not
bar
standing
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
flast
versus
cohen
in
1968
and
baker
versus
carr
in
1962.
on
the
contrary
it
is
because
the
club
represents
the
public
interest
that
any
questions
regarding
standing
should
be
resolved
in
its
favor
because
in
these
cases,
conservationist
organizations
maybe
the
only
people
who
will
step
forward
to
challenge
the
illegal
acts.
the
sierra
club
does
not
seek
to
review
authority
over
the
exercise
of
the
--
it
does
not
seek
to
have
its
own
review
authority
over
the
exercise
of
the
administrative
discretion.
it
asks
the
court
to
do
that
in
which
it
is
expert,
namely
to
decide
whether
the
federal
administrator
stepped
outside
the
bounds
of
their
statutory
authority.
that
view
should
not
be
barred
if
the
courthouse
do
it.
we
argue
that
the
disney
development
at
the
mineral
king
would
be
illegal
on
several
grounds,
but
in
any
event
the
proposed
new
high
speed
access
highway
across
the
sequoia
national
park
is
independently
illegal.
congress
has
expressly
protected
these
parks
in
their
natural
state
and
has
severely
limited
the
use
of
park
land.
the
organic
act
of
1916,
which
established
the
national
park
service,
included
section
16
u.s.
code,
section
1,
as
quoted
at
page
66
of
our
brief.
that
section
permits
the
use
of
parks
only
and
i
quote,
“by
such
means
and
measures
as
conform
to
the
fundamental
purposes
of
said
parks,
monuments
and
reservations
which
purposes
to
conserve
the
scenery,
the
natural
and
historic
objects
and
the
wildlife
therein
and
to
provide
for
the
enjoinment
of
that
the
same
in
such
a
manner
and
by
such
means
as
will
leave
them
unimpaired
for
the
enjoyment
of
future
generations.
this
statute
requires
that
any
changes
in
parks
from
their
natural
state
must
be
in
conformity
with
the
park
purpose.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
there
is
a
road
which
is
the
state
highway
that
traverses
sequoia
national
park
and
serves
the
purpose
of
providing
access
to
the
park.
there
is
the
mineral
king
road
which
existed
prior
to
the
existence
of
the
park.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
parallels
it,
but
on
an
entirely
different
route.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
mr.
justice
blackmun,
in
fact
there
are
private
in-holdings
in
mineral
king.
in
fact
this
is
an
instance
where
it
is
conceivable
that
there
are
people
who
--
individuals
who
would
have
an
injury
of
a
type
that
would
cause
them
in
theory
to
step
forward.
they
are
practical
limitations
on
their
doing
it.
one
is
that
often
people
in
this
in-holdings
are
benefited
economically
by
the
development
that
is
about
to
occur
and
any
aesthetic
impulse
they
had
is
overpowered
by
the
contrary
economic
impulse.
in
many
instances
and
in
the
case
of
sequoia
national
park
itself
--
it
is
a
good
example,
they
are
users
in
the
sense
of
people
who
have
private
in-holdings
that
would
be
affected
one
way
or
the
other
by
the
development.
so
in
answer
to
your
question,
if
not
the
sierra
club,
in
many
instances
nobody
or
if
not
an
environmental
organization,
nobody.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
yes,
there
are.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
mr.
justice
stewart
they
have
been
there
for
many,
many
years.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
now
in
order
to
give
the
highway
a
park
purpose
the
government
argues
now
that
to
see
--
that
mineral
king
really
is
part
of
the
park
at
--
that
the
statute
is
clear
that
congress
did
not
include
mineral
king
in
the
park
but
if
it
had
there
would
be
no
need
for
the
highway
because
the
disney
development
could
not
be
built
in
sequoia
national
park.
in
that
park,
16
u.s.
code,
section
45
(b)
which
is
set
forth
at
page
16
of
our
reply
brief,
barred
the
use
of
more
than
ten
acres
for
more
than
20
years
for
this
type
development.
disney’s
development
violates
both
the
space
and
time
limitations
of
that
section.
the
government
urges
us
to
disregard
all
of
these
statutes
because
the
secretary
of
the
interior
ought
to
be
able
to
cooperate
in
such
a
ways
to
provide
access
to
something
that
is
legal
outside
the
park.
in
the
first
place,
the
route
across
sequoia
national
park
is
not
the
only
available
route
of
access
to
mineral
king,
but
if
it
were
this
argument
must
fail.
it
would
permit
interior
to
disregard
all
limits
on
its
power
as
long
as
he
was
acting
in
aid
of
another
governmental
official.
nor
is
the
fact
that
there
is
a
road
in
existence,
a
legalizing
effect
for
the
proposed
new
highway.
a
new
highway
would
be
huge
by
contrast,
would
be
on
a
different
route,
with
new
cuts,
fills
and
structures
and
the
record
shows
that
its
effect
would
be
wipe
out
220
acres
of
virgin
park
land
to
endanger
sequoia
trees
and
to
create
a
barrier
for
the
3,000
man
and
wildlife.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
this
from
--
this
from
the
state
highway
to
mineral
king
is
approximately
25
miles.
that
highway
in
distance
across
sequoia
national
park
is
approximately
9
miles.
concerning
mineral
king
itself,
agriculture
would
not
have
authority
to
allow
it
even
if
it
were
ordinary
national
forest
land
which
it
is
not.
16
u.s.
code,
section
497
permits
the
term
use
of
only
80
acres
of
that
land
for
recreational
purposes.
the
disney
development
at
mineral
king
is
so
large
that
it
is
spills
over
those
80
acres
and
its
permanent
facilities
extend
beyond
them.
the
secretary
of
agriculture’s
attempt
to
get
around
497
by
issuing
a
second
permit
for
indispensable
acreage
violates
that
law.
16
u.s.
code,
section
551
is
not
authority
for
the
expanded
term
used.
that
statute
as
this
court
found
in
united
states
v.
grimaud
in
1911,
delegates
congress
power
only
over
administrative
detail.
it
is
not
the
necessary
express
delegation
of
power
to
transfer
term
interests
in
federal
land.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
mr.
justice
blackmun,
it
is
been
used
widely
for
permits
which
the
government
has
represented
in
every
case
were
terminable
at
will
and
those
permits
had
been
for
structures
in
many
instances.
but
in
every
instance
the
government
has
said,
we
are
in
a
position
to
take
this
--
the
usual
way
immediately
and
restore
the
public's
right
in
that
land.
the
fatal
difference,
the
difference
here
is
that
the
term
use
is
set
for
30
years
under
the
80
acre
permit
and
the
other
uses
are
absolutely
indispensable
to
the
use
that
is
made
on
the
80
acres
and
it
results
in
a
tie-in
together
other
uses
which
is
one
for
a
permit
for
a
period
of
30
years
for
acreage
exceeding
80.
the
government
correctly
argues,
section
497
previously
had
a
five
acre
limitation
and
that
was
amended
in
1956.
the
government
correctly
argues
that
the
motivation
of
those
who
wanted
to
expand
five
acres
to
80
acres
was
to
obtain
certainty
of
tenure
and
increase
financial
support
for
larger
developments.
but
this
explanation
is
of
what
happened
in
1956
is
incomplete
because
it
considers
only
the
goals
of
those
who
sought
relief
from
the
5
acre
limit
while
disregarding
the
reasons
for
any
acreage
limitation
at
all.
congress
was
concerned
over
the
adverse
effects
of
large
developments
on
national
forest
lands.
the
forest
service
told
congress
that
80
acres
was
necessary
in
order
to
include
all
the
facilities
in
modern
developments,
including
ski
lifts.
it
calmed
congress'
fears
by
saying
that
80
acres
was
the
maximum
limit.
this
is
set
forth
in
our
reply
brief
at
page
11,
footnote
25.
congress
did
not
make
the
amendment
which
could
have
been
in
order,
certainty
if
tenure
had
been
its
only
concern.
it
did
not
just
wipe
out
the
five
acre
limit.
instead
it
set
up
a
new
limit
80
acres.
in
the
entire
history
of
this
case
no
one
has
explained
the
purpose
of
that
limitation
if
not
to
restrict
developments
to
80
acres.
and
when
he
was
campaigning
for
relief
from
the
five-acre
limitation,
the
secretary
of
agriculture
did
reveal
that
he
had
used
combined
permits
to
get
around
the
five-acre
limit.
he
did
not
say
that
any
of
these
combined
permits
exceeded
80-acres.
a
key
to
this
matter
is
as
if
he
was
not
seeking
to
have
congress
ratify
his
practice
of
combining
permits,
rather
he
was
representing
that
if
he
could
grant
permits
for
up
to
80-acres
the
practice
would
be
discontinued.
the
ninth
circuit
erroneously
decided
that
the
interlocking
supplemental
permit
to
be
used
in
this
case
need
not
be
terminable
at
will.
several
attorneys-general,
including
harlan
fiske
stone
have
said
otherwise.
the
government
admits
at
page
48
of
its
brief,
the
supplemental
permit
is
essential
to
the
viability
of
the
project,
it
is
correct.
revocation
would
destroy
the
$35
million
disney
investment
a
major
portion
of
which
will
be
--
within
80
acres.
the
terrific
impact
on
mineral
king
of
this
development
would
make
it
impossible
to
restore
it
to
its
natural
state.
the
supplemental
term
from
--
supplemental
permit
is
not
even
technically
reputable.
now,
the
government
has
said
if
the
court
finds
that
all
of
this
is
illegal
--
it
will
affect
84
existing
ski
resorts.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
it
need
not
do
that.
this
is
not
a
consistent
administrative
practice.
some
regional
foresters
have
used
the
practice
and
others
have
rejected
it
and
in
any
event
there
is
no
general
department
policy
or
regulation
on
the
subject.
these
illegal
acts
do
not
legalize
mineral
king
and
they
do
not
require
this
court
to
choose
between
closing
them
down
and
making
mineral
king
legal.
the
court
may
--
make
the
operation
of
its
order
in
this
case
perspective
only.
now,
the
disney
development
is
illegal
as
it
stands
on
a
national
forest,
but
it
is
doubly
illegal
because
it
was
attempted
to
be
placed
on
a
game
refuge.
in
1926
when
it
created
that
game
refuge,
congress
said
that
its
purpose
was
to
protect
from
trespass,
the
public
lands
of
the
refuge
and
the
game
animals
that
may
be
on
it,
which
maybe
they
are
on,
is
the
language
of
the
statute.
the
impact
of
the
disney’s
develop
--
of
the
disney
development
on
the
games
habitat
would
be
enormous.
california
fishing
game
commission
personnel
have
stated
that
in
an
extensive
development
and
i
am
reading
from
our
appendix
at
page
30,
“that
in
an
extensive
development
such
as
the
disney
proposal,
considerable
wildlife
habitat
would
be
lost
and
wildlife
would
suffer
from
human
encroachment.”
the
secretary
has
made
no
finding
on
this
subject.
if
he
had,
the
finding
would
have
shown
that
he
abused
his
discretion.
we
previously
have
argued
that
the
refuge
is
not
in
sequoia
national
park
and
that
whatever
practice
there
maybe
on
national
parks
in
regard
to
ski
resorts
does
not
legalize
it
at
mineral
king.
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
leland
r.
selna,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
in
looking
at
the
merits
this
court
will
find
that
both
the
issue
of
the
legality
of
the
highway
in
the
national
park
and
the
legality
of
the
term
permits
or
combining
of
permits
to
exceed
80
acres
are
such
that
they
could
indeed
and
finally
decided
in
this
court.
turning
to
the
question
of
standing,
it
should
be
clear
from
our
argument
that
we
do
not
urge
that
the
doors
of
courts
be
opened
wide
to
anyone.
we
have
argued
that
there
are
criteria
which
should
be
applied
by
a
court
and
by
which
the
organizations
or
individual’s
qualifications
for
standing
should
be
tested.
the
club
in
this
case
did
in
fact
allege
its
special
interest
in
the
area
involved
and
in
this
area
i
have
noticed
pleading,
no
one
in
california
at
the
district
court
level
had
any
question
in
their
mind
as
to
the
deep
involvement
of
the
club
with
sequoia
national
park
and
mineral
king,
so
that
a
case
or
controversy
would
be
assured.
now,
the
solicitor
general
has
made
reference
to
the
reply
brief
and
to
our
reply
brief
in
dealing
with
the
matter
of
the
club’s
use
of
the
area
in
question.
it
is
true
that
the
sierra
club
for
a
number
of
years
has
run
pack
trips
in
mineral
king
and
it
is
also
true
that
is
specific
indicator
of
its
interest
in
the
area
was
not
part
of
the
allegations
of
the
complaint.
those
pack
trips
that
are
non-profit
activity
and
they
are
not
for
any
private
purpose.
their
purpose
is
to
acquaint
people
with
the
national
features
of
the
area
so
that
they
in
turn
will
be
workers
that
would
help
to
preserve
it.
any
interference,
which
the
disney
plan
would
have
with
those
pack
trips
would
not
have
been
of
sufficient
importance
to
this
club
to
undertake
the
litigation
that
it
has
ensued
here
and
because
of
those
pack
trips,
though
they
are
non-profit
and
though
they
are
in
furthering
service,
interest
in
the
area
could
have
been
misunderstood
as
an
economically
oriented
or
other
private
interest
not
directly
related
to
the
public
interest.
they
were
not
alleged.
now,
concerning
whether
the
courts
will
be
inundated
by
the
granting
of
standing
in
a
case
such
as
this,
i
should
only
say
that
the
experience
which
many,
many
cases
we
have
eluded
to
has
been
not
to
purport
--
inundated
it
all,
but
that
the
number
of
lawsuits
brought
by
environmentalists
and
conservationists
groups
has
been
significantly
limited
by
the
practicalities
and
the
realities
of
carrying
out
litigation
of
this
type.
now,
concerning
injury,
it
is
true
that
injury
to
aesthetic
and
conservational
and
recreational
values
is
different
in
kind
than
an
injury
to
a
voter’s
rights
or
an
injury
to
a
tax
payer’s
rights.
it
is
nevertheless
a
concrete
injury
and
it
should
serve
everybody
strongly.
as
this
court
has
already
noted
in
the
data
processing
case
as
a
basis
for
statutory
agreement,
aggrievement
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
as
those
other
types
of
injury.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
