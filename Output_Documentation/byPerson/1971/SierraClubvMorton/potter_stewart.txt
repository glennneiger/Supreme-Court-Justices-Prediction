how
old
is
this
club?
justice
potter
stewart
it
has
about
78,000
members?
justice
potter
stewart
i
was
just
wondering
how
far
your
argument
would
go.
i
am
reminded
of
these
so
called
clubs
that
--
that
gets
chartered
airplane
flights
across
the
atlantic
ocean,
these
ad
hoc
organizations
because
i
have
formed
a
club,
the
fans
of
the
walt
disney
production
come
in
on
the
other
side
as
party?
justice
potter
stewart
a
lot
of
what
then
and
on
what
criteria?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
all
of
these
things
would
have
to
be
tried
out
and
litigated
and
decided
before
one
could
decide
whether
or
not
this
organization
was
a
proper
party?
justice
potter
stewart
i
might
say,
i
am
using
my
analogy
which
like
all
analogies
is
not
very
exact
perhaps,
but
of
these
clubs
that
charter
airplanes
across
the
atlantic
ocean,
even
with
all
enforcement
of
the
schedule
to
airlines,
trying
to
implement
the
policing
of
them
they
have
not
--
there
has
not
been
very
successful
policing,
has
there?
justice
potter
stewart
i
do
not
think
even
if
the
club
were
brand
new,
if
it
were
a
club
of
an
association
of
people
interested,
let
us
say
friends
of
--
friends
of
bigger
highways,
that
was
all
--
all
in
favor
of
this
new
highway
coming
into
mineral
king
and
if
they
were
really
friends
of
great
big
broad
paved
highways
and
they
were
bona
fide,
and
if
they
associate
to
become
a
party
and
bring
a
lawsuit
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
why
does
it
have
to
be
an
association?
why
could
not
be
a
man,
let
us
make
him
an
old
man
who
for
70
years
has
had
a
very
genuine
interest,
you
know
what
the
sierra
cub
was
interested
in.
he
is
now
75
and
he
has
had
this
--
a
very
genuine
interest
since
he
was
5
years
old,
for
70
years
and
he
can
show
it
to
the
satisfaction
of
a
court,
has
exact
--
has
had
exactly
the
same
interest
that
the
sierra
club
has.
why
could
he
not
bring
this
lawsuit?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
is
--
in
this
specific
case
there
are
private
landowners
up
there,
are
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
i
was,
you
can
take
pot
trips
out
of
there
and
they
have
have
done
it
and
then
--
there
are
outsiders
and
so
on?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
mount
whitney
--
mount
whitney
is
in
the
national
park,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
i
have
a
motion
for
leave
to
file
a
brief
of
amicus
curiae
in
behalf
of
the
united
states
ski
association
and
the
far
west
ski
association?
justice
potter
stewart
in
january,
i
have
not
--
i
do
not
seem
to
have
their
brief,
did
they
file
their
brief?
