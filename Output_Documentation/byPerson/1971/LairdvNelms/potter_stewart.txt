the

(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
well
this
is
--
north
carolina
has
what's
called
a
uniform
aviation
statute.
i
can't
find
text
to
that
statute
because
it
means
patently
something
else.
justice
potter
stewart
you
referred
to
trespass
and
my
impression
was,
although
i
don't
have
the
text
to
this
statute,
state
statute,
before
me
that
that's
exactly
what
the
state
makes
this.
and
it
says
that
in
a
point
of
view
of
over
flying
aircraft
and
a
landowner
owns
all
the
way
up
to
the
heavens
in
concept
and
the
old
common
law
concept
and
then
goes
an
airplane
that
invades
the
airspace
above
his
real
estate
is
truly
a
trespass.
damages
are
involved,
those
are
damages
that
result
from
trespass.
and
you
just
conceded
that
there
is
federal
tort
claim
act
liability
and
the
you
have
a
trespass.
have
you
not?
justice
potter
stewart
we
don't
have
the
text
of
the
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
liability,
we
were
told
that
it
was
trespass
and
there
wasn't
that
kind
of
a
physical
kind
of
trespass
and
that
wasn't
that
kind
of
trespass
into
my
case.
justice
potter
stewart
well
it
is
wrongful
it's
by
virtue
of
apartments
and
trespass,
is
it
not?
if
i
walk
on
somebody
else's
property
to
get
a
airplane
in
the
statute,
that's
a
trespass
whether
or
not
i
have
evil
intent
or
not.
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
it's
not
this
theory
on
which
of
the
court
of
appeals
has
rested
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
quite,
and
we
believe
quite
certainly
that
it
had
a
much
narrower
definition
that
if
had
meant
something
that
would
give
rise
to
liability
under
state
law,
different
words
would
have
been
used
and
the
court
said
in
dalehite,
that
different
words
would
have
been
used
and
the
court
said
in
dalehite
that
if
“wrongful'
had
meant
simply
tortious
in
the
sense
of
giving
rise
to
liability
that
there
are
other
models
for
compensation
such
as
the
maritime
act,
for
example,
which
specify
that
any
act
which
is
considered
tortious,
gives
rise
to
federal
liability.
justice
potter
stewart
that
strikes
me,
might
be
materials
that
you
do
see
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
exactly
those
imply
to
my
brother
marshall's
question
as
i
understood
it.
the
government
doesn't
have
to
show
that
the
regulations
were
legal,
why
it
is
reasonable
or
right
through
anything
else
but
simply
that
they
were.
there
was
a
discretionary
function
even
though
the
discretion
was
--
arguably
an
unreasonably
exercise
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
basically
here
you
would
say
there
was
simply
no
taking
whatever
--
justice
potter
stewart
what's
that
decision?
justice
potter
stewart
you
have
to
have
the
citation?
justice
potter
stewart
in
your
brief,
no
doubt,
but
i
can't
find
--
page
3
of
the
brief
on
opposition?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
i
have.
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
was
the
praylou
case
decided
before
or
after
the
dalehite
case,
do
you
know?
justice
potter
stewart
afterwards,
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
happen
to
have
any
citations
of
those
two
law
reviews?
