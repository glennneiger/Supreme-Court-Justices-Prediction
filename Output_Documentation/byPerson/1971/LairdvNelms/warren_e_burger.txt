mr.

you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
not
so
sure
that
it's
important
at
all
that
dalehite
case,
actually
it
was
not
government,
private
contractors
were
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
was
basic
issue
that
a
private
contractor
was
implementing
governmental
policies
and
try
to
keep
(inaudible)
from
starving?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
stone,
one
of
the
most
frequent
kinds
of
damages
from
the
sonic
booms
is
shattered
windows.
were
there
any
shattered
windows
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
only
inquiry
is
whether
the
sonic
boom
caused
the
damage
to
the
extent
of
the
damage.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
anything
in
the
nature
of
the
election
of
remedies
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
there
any
private
aircraft
that
created
sonic
boom?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
it's
military
aircraft
only.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
they
are
all
properly
built,
there
are
no
governmentally
instructed
construct
a
military
aircraft?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
should
say,
it
might
be
rather
important
in
this
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
stone,
suppose
this
plane,
this
was
giving
off
sonic
booms
or
creating,
had
instead,
or
at
the
same
time
it
was
doing
this
booming,
lost
its
power,
and
fallen
right
on
this
house
and
demolished,
tort
claims
act
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
don't
recall
the
fourth
circuit
case,
there
was
one
perhaps
17
or
18
years
ago,
shortly
after
dalehite
in
which
the
pilot
thought
his
plane
was
going
to
crash
and
so
he
put
it
on
automatic
control
and
headed
it
out
to
sea
and
he
jumped
with
a
parachute
and
the
automatic
pilot
wasn't
working
and
the
plane
circled
and
landed
on
a
house
in
baltimore.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
stone,
we
will
remand
your
time
five
minutes
and
give
mr.

five
minutes,
so
you
can
divide
it
the
way
you
wish.
chief

warren
e.

very
well,
mr.

mr.

you
will
have
five
additional
minutes
in
addition
to
your
30
minutes,
mr.
allen.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
all
of
these
allegations
and
damage
appeared
in
the
complaint
itself?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
are
they
not
limited
to
cases
which
are
not
covered?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
those
regulations
limited
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
are
not.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
the
case
where
the
plane
fell
on
the
house
in
baltimore,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
you
go
onto
that
mr.
allen.
do
you
read
the
tort
claims
act
with
decisions
under
it
as
affecting
the
basic
fifth
amendment
rights
for
a
taking?
chief
justice
warren
e.

your
last
statement
sounded
as
though
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
prior
statement
sounded
as
thought
that
tort
claims
act
had
intent
on
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
allen
let
me
a
put
a
hypothetical
question
to
you
which
may
or
may
not
shed
any
light
on
the
problem.
suppose
we
were
engaged
in
the
war,
enemy
attacks
on
an
american
establishment
and
antiaircraft
guns
were
used
to
repel
the
attack,
and
of
course
as
we
know
antiaircraft
gun
fire,
if
it
doesn't
hit
the
enemy
airplane,
ultimately,
it
has
to
fall
down
back
to
earth.
of
course,
it
falls
on
either
people
or
houses
or
cows,
animals,
it
does
some
damage.
do
you
think
it's
covered
with
the
tort
claims
act?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
would
be
a
highly
discretionary
governmental
function
was
it
not
just
to
shoot
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
think
that
exception
that
about
discretionary
actions
means
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
would
be
the
highest
order
of
discretion,
would
it
not
if
the
ground
forces
were
ordered
to
repel
the
enemy
attack
by
the
use
of
anti
aircraft
fire?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
could
supply
both
of
them
to
the
clerk
mr.
allen,
if
you
may
supply
both
to
the
clerk
after
the
argument
if
you
don't
have
them
at
this
time.
chief

you

you
