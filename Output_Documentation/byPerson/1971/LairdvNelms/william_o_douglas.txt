i
thought
that
the
government
had
a
department
where
the
person
who
suffered
damages
of
this
nature
can
submit
a
claim
and
they
would
be
paid
administratively.
justice
william

it
is
at
west,
where
i
come
from,
this
sonic
thing
has
been
a
terrible
nuisance
and
it
has
injured
a
lot
of
properties,
people
have
filed
their
claims
and
they
get
paid.
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
there
a,
like
the
maximum
that's
allowed
under
the
pay
claim
act?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
i
get
that
mr.
stone,
are
you
suggesting
that
under
the
military
pay
claims
act,
in
that
procedure,
there
has
to
be
a
determination
in
the
first
instance
before
an
allowance
is
made
to
the
claimant,
that
there
would
be
liability
under
the
tort
claims
act?
justice
william
o.
douglas
before
that
maybe,
is
that
right?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
did
he
have
to
go
first
for
relief
from
the
military
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
because
for
no
other
reason,
they
are
mutually
exclusive.
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
is
it
congress
that
has
said
that
no
administrative
payments
where
it
is
covered
by
the
tort
claims
act
or
is
that
regulated
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
so
that,
you
argued
that
congress
thereby
itself
indicates
at
least,
some
kinds
of
damage
that
are
not
covered
by
the
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
have
you
ever
been
on
a
horse
when
one
of
these
sonic
booms
hits?
justice
william
o.
douglas
speaking
of
what's
wrong
or
not,
perhaps
that
aircrafts
fly
over
horse
and
people
not
doing
their
own
business
in
a
peaceful
ordinary
way,
and
this
thing
hits.

is
to
suffer
the
loss?
