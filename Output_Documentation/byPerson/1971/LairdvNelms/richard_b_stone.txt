mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
which
comes
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
raises
two
important
questions
of
statutory
interpretation
concerning
the
scope
of
the
government's
liability
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
the
issues
in
this
case
are
closely
related
to
and
in
our
opinion,
virtually
controlled
by
the
issues
decided
by
this
court
in
the
landmark
case
of
dalehite
versus
united
states
decided
at
346
us.
in
that
case,
of
course,
the
government
was
held
not
liable
under
the
tort
claims
act
for
damage
caused
in
the
disastrous
explosion
of
certain
chemical
fertilizers
with
it
in
fact
being
transported
by
the
government
for
export
abroad
which
explosion
virtually
devastated
the
city
of
texas.
fortunately,
the
factual
context
to
this
case
is
somewhat
less
ghastly
than
that
which
the
court
confronted
in
dalehite.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that's
right,
but
it
had
been
carried
out
for
suing
to
a
government
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
think,
for
the
most
part
mr.
chief
justice,
it
was
assumed
in
the
decision
that
the
government
had
played
a
sufficiently
close
role
in
entire
process
including
the
planning
of
the
export
and
the
transporting
and
packing
of
the
materials,
that,
that
issue
was,
at
least
that
level
of
responsibility
was
assumed
in
the
opinion.
respondents
or
residents
of
nashville,
north
carolina
which
is
a
rural
community
of
about
1500
inhabitants.
and
respondents
alleged
there
on
several
occasions
and
especially
on
november
14,
1968,
their
house
was
damaged
by
so
called
sonic
booms,
which
put
simply
noisy
vibrations
that
may
occur
when
aircraft
fly
overhead,
it's
speed
greater
than
the
speed
of
sound.
respondent
sought
first
to
recover
from
the
air
force
under
the
administrative
procedures
authorized
by
the
military
pay
claims
act
and
the
air
force
regulations
promulgated
thereunder.
but
the
air
force
engineer
who
investigated
their
house,
concluded
in
a
detailed
report
which
is
reproduced
at
pages
16
and
17
of
the
record,
concluded
that
the
damages
to
respondent's
home
had
indeed
not
been
caused
by
sonic
booms.
respondents
then
sued
the
government
and
the
district
court
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
in
answer
to
their
complaint
and
supporting
affidavits,
corroborating
the
event
of
the
sonic
boom
and
the
relation
of
the
november
14
sonic
boom
to
certain
damages
sustained
by
respondent's
home.
the
government
filed
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
supporting
affidavits.
the
government's
affidavits
acknowledged
that
indeed
the
air
force
had
conducted
a
supersonic
flight
over
the
nashville,
north
carolina
area
on
the
alleged
day
and
that
the
aircraft
and
the
flight
were
attached
to
the
ninth
strategic
reconnaissance
wing
of
the
strategic
air
command.
that
is
a
branch
of
the
air
force
which
is
charged
with
the
execution
of
periodic
high
level
supersonic
training
flights.
these
flights,
i
understand
are
used
for
training
pilots
for
combat
missions
and
are
regulated
by
comprehensive
predetermined
flight
plans.
the
commander-in-chief
of
the
strategic
air
command
general
holloway
who
ranks
for
purposes
of
this
type
of
operations
directly
below
the
joint
chiefs
of
staff,
stated
in
his
affidavit
that
he
directed
the
operational
training
of
air
cruise
by
supersonic
flights.
and
that
the
november
14
flight
was
in
his
words,
“authorized
by
and
conducted
pursuant
to
my
direction”.
other
affidavits
filed
by
high
air
force
personnel
also
stated
that
the
flight
was
at
all
times
on
course,
with
respect
to
location
and
altitude
as
prescribed
by
the
mission
flight
plan
directed
by
the
commander
in
chief
and
this
statement
is,
i
gather
not
controverted
in
any
of
the
record
of
this
case
or
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
nor
it
is
alleged
at
all
that
the
flight
plan
itself
was
in
any
manner
faulty.
the
district
court
granted
the
government's
motion
for
summary
judgment
on
the
authority
of
the
dalehite
case,
on
the
ground
primarily
that
the
planning
and
execution
of
the
flights
in
question
was
a
“discretionary
function”
for
which
the
government
is
specifically
exempted
from
liability
under
section
2688
of
the
tort
claims
act.
and
i
shall
address
myself
to
that
discretionary
function
provision
shortly.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
district
court's
plan
of
summary
judgment
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
discretionary
function
exemption
was
inapplicable
in
this
case
for
reasons
which
as
i
say,
i
shall
refer
to
later.
on
the
merits
of
the
case,
after
getting
over
the
discretionary
function
exemption,
the
court
held
in
direct
contradiction
i
believe
to
this
court's
holding
in
dalehite,
that
even
though
no
negligence
in
the
planning
or
operation
of
the
flight
had
been
alleged
and
no
wrongful
conduct
at
all
had
been
alleged,
the
government
could
still
be
liable
under
the
tort
claims
act
under
a
fury
of
strict
liability
for
engaging
in
ultra
hazardous
activity.
the
government
believes
that
court
of
appeals
erred
in
both
aspects
of
its
holding,
both
respect
to
it's
refusal
to
apply
the
discretionary
function
exemption
and
on
the
merits
in
it's
imposition
of
the
theory
of
absolute
liability
for
the
conduct
of
ultra
hazardous
activity
under
the
tort
claims
act.
and
i
shall
with
the
court's
permission
deal
first
with
the
merits
of
the
case,
that
is,
the
question
whether
the
tort
claims
act
gives
rise
to
government
liability
for
ultra
hazardous
activities
without
finding
a
fault
or
negligence.
as
i
imagine
the
members
of
this
court
are
well
aware
that
tort
claims
act
was
enacted
by
congress
in
1946
and
authorized
for
the
first
time
in
this
country's
history,
a
very
limited
and
well
defined
range
of
tort
actions
which
could
be
brought
against
the
federal
government.
the
issue
whether
the
government
ought
to
waive
its
sovereign
immunity
from
tort
actions
had
been
vigorously
debated
in
virtually
every
congress
since
1990
and
over
30
bills
had
been
introduced
and
extensively
discussed
in
both
houses
of
the
congress.
we
attempt
to
show
throughout
our
brief
in
this
case,
as
we
did
very
extensively
in
our
brief
in
the
dalehite
case.
we
have
put
in
our
brief
here
a
summary
of
extremely
complex
legislative
history
of
this
act.
as
this
court
noted
in
dalehite
the
overwhelming
concern
of
the
congress
throughout
its
discussions
about
whether
to
subject
the
united
states
to
tort
liability
was
the
need
to
provide
compensation
without
resort
to
the
laborious
process
of
private
bills
for
those
who
had
been
injured
by
the
ordinary
common
law
tortuous
acts
of
individual
government
employees
and
agents.
and
the
chief
example
of
such
a
tortuous
act
used
literally
hundreds
of
times
in
the
discussions
is
the
negligent
operation
of
a
motor
vehicle
driven
by
government
employee
in
the
scope
of
his
employment.
indeed
the
house
report
in
the
79th
congress
which
ultimately
passed
the
final
version
of
the
tort
claims
act
noted
the
need
to
ensure
that
the
act
would
“preclude
any
possibility
that
the
bill
might
be
construed
to
authorize
suit
for
damages
growing
out
of
an
authorized
activity
where
no
negligence
on
the
part
of
any
governmental
agent
is
shown
and
the
only
ground
for
suit
is
the
contention
that
the
same
conduct
by
private
individual
would
be
tortuous.”
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that
is
right
mr.
justice
douglas.
there
is
provision
in
the
military
pay
claims
act
which
is
set
out
at
10
usc
2732
and
so
on
by
which
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes,
and
so
in
this
case,
similarly
in
this
case
a
claim
was
filed
to
the
air
force.
what
the
military
pay
claims
act
does
is
authorize
the
air
force
to
establish,
and
there
are
other
branches
of
the
military
through
whom
damage
might
occur
to
civilians
to
institute
procedures
under
which
recovery
might
be
sought
regardless
of
fault.
and
that
administrative
procedure
was
indeed
followed
in
this
case
by
respondents
and
the
air
force
as
i
stated
earlier,
the
air
force
engineer
determined
that
there
was
no
cause
of
connection
in
this
case
between
the
sonic
boom
and
the
damage
inflicted.
as
a
routine
matter,
the
air
force
does
pay
up
to
a
certain
maximum
amount
specified
in
the
military
pay
claims
act,
damages
that
occur
through
sonic
booms,
but
this
is
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
according
to
the
investigative
report,
there
were
no
shattered
windows
here
and
i
gathered
that
the
primary
aspect
to
damage
which
respondents
have
alleged
is
cracking
in
the
walls.
and
the
engineer
noted
in
his
report
a
number
of
reasons
why
he
thought
that
it
was
impossible
that
the
cracking
in
the
walls
of
this
particular
house
could
have
been
caused
by
sonic
boom
and
i
think
the
air
force
takes
position
generally,
that
cracked
glass
is
the
primary
danger
and
that
major
structural
damage
has
really
not
been
proved
yet
to
be
correlated
with
the
sonic
booms,
but
i
think,
that
issue
is
not
present
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that's
right.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
and
the
suit
was
filed
under
the
tort
claims
act
which
is
by
the
very
terms
of
the
military
pay
claims
act,
mutually
exclusive
with
tort
act
liability.
there
is
only,
military
pay
claims
acts
liability
is
only
authorized
in
the
event
that
there
is
no
claim
under
the
tort
claims
act
which
we
believe
incidentally
is
a
recognition
of
the
fact
that
the
tort
claims
act
does
not
cover
liability
in
the
absence
of
some
sort
of
fault
or
wrong.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
under
the
pay
claim
act,
there
is
a
$15,000
maximum
except
in
certain
--
that
can
be
through
certain
special
procedures
can
be
waived,
if
necessary.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no,
there
has
to
be
a
determination
that
there
would
not
be
liability
under
the
tort
claims
act
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that's
right,
that's
right.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
exactly.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no,
we
are
not
suggesting,
i
don't
think
anything
in
that
nature.
we
are
suggesting
that
respondent
has
failed
successfully
to
achieve
a
remedy
through
the
administrative
process
authorized
by
the
military
pay
claims
act
that
he
is
now
suing
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
and
that,
that
act
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no,
i
don't
believe
he
did.
we
would
not
argue
with
any
exhaustion
principle.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
mutually
exclusive,
that's
right.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that's
congress
who
said
that,
that's
10
u.s.c.
2733
(b).
mr.
richard
b.
stone
tort
claims
act,
that's
right.
let
me
get
back
to
the
language
of
the
tort
claims
act
itself,
even
though
negligence
was
the
major
concern,
we
of
course,
acknowledged
that
the
act
was
worded
not
truly
in
terms
of
negligence
but
rather
in
terms
of
injury
caused
by
the
negligent
or
wrongful
act
or
mission
of
any
employee
under
circumstances
that
may
give
rise
to
state
liability.
in
the
view
of
the
court
of
appeals,
the
addition
of
the
word
wrongful,
and
that
is
the
important
word
for
purposes
of
this
case,
means
the
congress
intended
to
waive
the
immunity
from
tort
action
by
the
government
for
any
act
which
would
be
grounds
for
tort
suit
under
the
law
of
the
state,
where
the
act
in
question
occurred,
and
since
a
person
maybe
liable
in
north
carolina
to
a
tort
suit
for
ultra
hazardous
activity
without
any
question
of
fault,
the
court
reasons
that
the
government
is
correspondingly
liable
here
and
disregarding
the
question
of
whether
operation
of
supersonic
flights
constitutes
an
ultra
hazardous
activity
which
i
don't
believe
the
court
properly
determined,
which
in
any
event
what
i
think
require
a
fact
finding
proceeding
of
some
sort.
we
believe
the
court
was
in
very
serious
error
when
it
read
the
word,
wrongful,
in
the
tort
claims
act,
to
apply
to
absolute
liability
for
ultra
hazardous
activity.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
now
there
are
two
different
problems
here,
there
is
both
the
discretionary
function
problem
which
i
shall
get
to
and
the
question
whether
there
was
any
wrongful
and
negligent
act.
both,
in
order
for
there
to
be
federal
tort
claim
act
liability,
both
of
those
conditions
have
to
be
fulfilled.
there
has
to
be
a
non-discretionary
function
by
a
federal
employee
and
there
has
to
be
a
wrongful
or
negligent
act.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
then
your
only
remedy
is
from
the
air
force
administrative
procedure.
our
essential
position
in
this
case
is,
i
think
it
is
hornbook
tort
law
that
strict
or
absolute
liability
for
the
conduct
of
an
ultra
hazardous
activity
is
imposed
not
because
a
person
has
engaged
in
conduct
which
is
in
any
way
negligent
or
wrongful,
but
merely
because
the
activity
is
one
which
poses
a
likelihood
of
damage
regardless
of
a
level
of
care
exercised
and
as
the
commentators,
i
think,
unanimously
agree,
it
is
the
unique
characteristic
of
this
type
of
liability
that
it
is
imposed
not
because
of
a
wrongful
act
but
because
of
a
policy
judgment
that
the
person
who
engages
in
an
ultrahazardous
activity
should
bear
the
risk
of
harm
caused
by
that
activity.
and
whatever
the
word
wrongful
means,
in
addition
to
the
word
negligence,
it
simply
makes
no
sense
to
say
that
an
act
is
wrongful
because
it
gives
rise
to
liability
under
state
law,
especially
when
the
underlying
assumption
of
that
state
law
is
not
that
the
conduct
is
wrongful
but
on
the
contrary,
that
it
is
being
to
give
rise
to
liability
for
policy
reasons
in
spite,
explicitly
in
spite
of
its
not
being
wrongful.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
to
my
knowledge
mr.
chief
justice
there
are
not
so
far,
but
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
to
my
knowledge,
it
is
a
problem
that
has
been
exclusively
here
in
the
domain
of
military
aircraft
but
if
that
is
not
in
the
record,
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question
whether
--
i
am
quite
certain
that
there
are
private
companies
which
are
engaged
in
building
the
planes
that
can
fly
at
more
than
supersonic
speeds
but
whether
they
are
being
used
for
any
other
than
military
purposes,
i
don't
know.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that's
right.
what
i
understand
is
that
there
are
plans
for
the
use
of
planes
flying
at
these
sonic
boom
oriented
speeds
by
private
industry,
but
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
evidence
that
they
are
yet
flying.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
don't
know.
i
would
conclude
this
portion
of
the
argument
by
referring
to
the
very
extensive
legislative
history
of
the
act
which
we
discussed
for
these
purposes
at
pages
13-16
of
our
brief,
which
indicate
that
the
word
negligence
was
intended
to
cover
the
great
bulk
of
cases
brought
under
the
statute
and
the
word
wrongful
was
quite
explicitly
meant
to
have
a
very,
very
narrow
purpose
of
primarily
including
certain
kinds
of
trespass
which
were
not
necessarily
negligent
and
this
court
in
dalehite,
very
explicitly
agreed
with
this
reading
of
the
legislative
history.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
it
excludes
most
intentional
wrong,
section
2680
(f),
i
think,
it
is,
quite
explicitly
excludes
assaults
and
false
imprisonments
and
intentional
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
those
deliberate
torts
which
are
excluded
are
excluded
by
name
and
trespass,
deliberate
trespass
is
not
excluded.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
within
wrongful,
that's
right.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
think
that's
precisely
the
kind
of
situation
which
gives
rise
to
strict
liability
for
ultrahazardous
activity
where
there
is
a
statistical
certainty
that
at
some
point
if
you
continue
to
carry
on
this
activity,
some
kind
of
damage
will
occur,
but
it
is
considered
inherently
a
reasonable
activity
to
perform,
and
liability
is
considered
to
be
imposed
regardless
of
any
fault.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
this
is
a
question
that's
raised
in
all
the
commentaries
with
respect
to
where
the
strict
liability
is
an
intentional
tort.
i
don't
think
that
plays
into
the
tort
claims
act
in
any
event
because
the
exceptions
in
the
tort
claims
act
are
not
too
intentional
torts
by
category
but
to
certain
specific
torts
all
of
which
are
intentional.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
think,
that's
right,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
and
the
mere
fact
that
he
intended
to
do
the
act
and
knew
that
it
was
a
statistical
probability
indeed,
a
statistical
certainty
that
some
damage
would
ultimately
occur,
is
not,
i
think,
been
considered
by
any
of
the
commentators
to
be
an
intentional
tort
for
proser
and
restatement
of
torts
by
categorization
purposes
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
and
we
say
not
wrongful
and
this
court
quite
specifically
in
dalehite
said
that
activity
of
this
nature
was
not
wrongful
and
that
was
not
dealing
with
sonic
booms
but
it
was
dealing
with
this
broad
category
which
is
defined
in
terms
of
a
relative
certainty
that
some
sort
of
damage
will
occur.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
have
not
been
mr.
justice
douglas.
i
understand
that's
one
of
the
more
unpleasant
aspects
of
a
sonic
booms.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
mr.
justice
douglas,
there
are
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
there
indeed
is
the
question
as
to
who
should
suffer
the
loss,
in
this
situation
and
in
many
situations
in
which
many
governmental
activity
regardless
of
finding
a
fault
or
wrong
causes
damage
to
an
individual.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
the
congress
has
not
chosen
to
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that's
exactly
right
mr.
justice
brennan,
but
the
tort
claims
act
in
very
specific
terms
says
that
the
activity
must
be
wrongful
and
this
court
in
dalehite
very
explicitly
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
oh,
it's
--
yeah,
i
am
told
that
it's
not.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
whether
north
carolina
law
categorizes
this
as
a
trespass.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
we
have
a
reference
in
our
petition
to
north
carolina
general
statute
6314,
this
is
on
the
footnote
on
page
26
of
the
petition
and
i
think
that
the
reason
we
have
not
gone
into
this
in
detail
in
north
carolina
law
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
which
held
in
respondent's
favor
assumed
that
the
theory
of
north
carolina
law
which
it
was
based
in
its
holding
of
tort
claims
act
liability
on
was
a
strict,
conventional
strict-liability
for
hazardous
activity
theory
and
not
a
trespass
theory.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
oh,
excuse
me,
let
me
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
let
me
answer
the
question
by
saying
that
i
don't
think
--
i
think
that
the
kind
of
trespass,
even
a
trespass
would
have
to
be
wrongful
in
some
sense.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
think
unless
there
is
some
element
of
thought
even
though
it
can
be
labeled
a
trespass,
it's
not
necessarily
wrongful.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
it's
tortious.
it
maybe
tortious
but
it
is
not
necessarily
wrongful.
and
in
any
event,
excuse
me.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
i
would
suggest
that
we
don't
know
whether
north
carolina
law
specifically
hold
this
on.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
it
would
be
rather
importance
but
it's
not.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that
i
gather
has
been
held
in
different
ways
in
circuits
that
if
a
falling
which
is
--
a
falling
which
occurs,
regardless
of
fault,
i
think
we
would
argue,
it's
still
not
a
compensable
necessarily
under
the
tort
claims
act.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that's
right
mr.
justice
white,
we'd
say
that
that
was
not
a
wrongful,
not
a
wrongful
act
by
a
federal
employee.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
believe
mr.
chief
justice,
that
that's
the
praylou
case
and
indeed
that
case
was
decided
very
shortly
after
dalehite,
and
this
court
held
that
--
this
court
denied
certiorari
in
the
case.
the
fourth
circuit
held
that
there
was
liability
but
one
of
the
theories
argued
in
that
case,
was
the
theory
of
(inaudible)
and
that
when
this
court
denied
certiorari,
the
papers
before
the
court
emphasized
heavily
that
the
theory
of
(inaudible)was
in
the
case,
so
that
in
effect
negligence
was
alleged
and
we
have
always
assumed
that
the
court
denied
certiorari
for
primarily
because
there
was
a
problem
of
negligence
and
not
an
understanding
that
dalehite
was
being
quietly
reversed
four
months
later
on
it's
holding
that
there
was
no
absolute
liability.
mr.
justice
stewart,
let
me
add
to
your
question
that
i
simply
don't
know
precisely
how
--
i
have
taken
this
on
the
assumption
that
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
interpreted
north
carolina
laws
especially
since
the
court
of
appeals
held
for
respondent's
on
a
theory,
most
favorable
to
them,
and
i
haven't
looked
any
further
into
it
but
i
would
certainly
be
happy
to
make
a
further
submission
about
north
carolina
law
if
the
court
beams
at
questions
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
we'd
be
happy
to
address
ourselves
to
this
question
in
a
supplemental
--
i
see,
i
have
right
at
the
time
and
i
have
not
yet
gotten
to
the
second
question
which
is
whether
the
tort
claims
act
precludes
recovery
on
the
basis
of
the
section
2680a
exemption
for
discretionary
functions.
i
would
say
in
brief
that
i
think
that
the
fact
that
this
activity
inherently,
the
planning
operation
of
this
flight
was
inherently
a
discretionary
function
within
the
meaning
of
a
2680
exemption,
is
un-controverted
by
anyone
in
this
case
including
respondents
and
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
activity
was
inherently
discretionary,
follows
very
much
a
fortiori
from
the
dalehite
case.
the
ground
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
refused
to
apply
the
discretionary
function
exemption,
was
not
that
the
activities
were
not
discretionary
but
that
the
discretion
was
moved
by
the
air
force
regulation
5534
which
is
reprinted
as
appendix
c
to
our
petition
and
that
is
indeed
the
regulation
promulgated
pursuant
to
the
military
claims
act,
which
deals
with
procedures
applicable
to
super
sonic
flights
and
recovery
for
super
sonic
flights.
and
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that,
that
regulation
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
discretionary
nature
of
the
activities
involved
in
this
case.
the
court
cited
specifically
two
aspects
of
regulation
5534.
it
first
noted
that
the
regulation
instructs
the
air
force
to
assure
“maximum
protection
for
civilian
communities
in
carrying
out
the
flights,”
and
from
this
the
court
appears
to
have
a
reason
that
if
any
damage
to
a
civilian
occurs,
the
conduct
of
the
flight
in
some
way,
loses
its
discretionary
nature.
the
short
answer
to
this
contention
and
i
think
there
are
several
other
answers
also
is
that
that
the
provision
for
maximum
protection
of
civilians
is
in
its
own
words
made
applicable
only
wherever
or
whenever
feasible
and
accordingly
flights
are
required
to
avoid
populated
areas,
“as
much
as
possible”,
language
which
on
its
face
leaves
the
air
force
with
considerable
discretion
and
which
is
not
even
alleged
to
have
been
abused
in
this
case.
and
in
addition
of
course,
i
don't
think
that
that
regulation
could
have
changed,
widened
the
scope
of
government
liability
under
the
tort
claims
act
anyway.
the
court
also
refused
to
apply
the
discretionary
function
exemption
on
the
ground
that
the
regulation
specifies
that
“the
air
force
must
accept
the
responsibility,”
for
damage
caused
by
sonic
boom
and
from
this,
the
court
reasoned
that
there
is
no
discretion
to
fly
supersonic
airplane
without
compensating
injured
civilians.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
this
aspect
of
the
lower
court’s
holding
is
really
plain
on
words
because
whatever
discretion
the
air
force
has
to
under
its
own
regulations
to
pay
or
refuse,
to
pay
damages
to
injured
persons
has
nothing
to
do
with
discretionary
function
provision
of
the
tort
claims
act,
which
relates
only
to
the
nature
of
the
activity
engaged
in
and
not
to
the
obligation
to
pay
a
claim.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
i
would
add
again
that
i
don't
think
air
force
regulations
dealing
with
repayment
of
claims
can
confer
tort
claim
act
jurisdiction
on
the
federal
courts
in
cases
which
are
specifically
excluded
from
jurisdiction
by
that
act.
when
respondents
sought
relief
from
the
act,
from
the
air
force
pursuant
to
this
regulation,
as
i
said
earlier
that
the
air
force
engineer
who
investigated
the
damaged
of
premises
concluded
that
the
damage
was
really
far
smaller
in
amount
than
respondents
had
claimed
and
then
in
any
event
it
was
not
the
type
of
damage
that
could
be
caused
by
sonic
boom.
and
i
think
one
suspects
that
the
court
below
was
motivated
in
this
case
essentially
by
fueling
that
the
government
ought
to
bear
the
risk
of
damage
caused
by
its
operation
of
supersonic
flights,
and
indeed
i
suppose
the
theory
would
extend
to
the
risk
of
most
any
government
operation
in
which
there
was
some
likelyhood
of
damaged
being
imposed
or
even
in
which
damage
was
inflicted
at
all.
congress
has
simply
not
chosen
and
deliberately
not
chosen
to
undertake
this
kind
of
risk.
prior
to
1946
as
i
said,
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
don't
want
to
go
all
that
distance
of
course,
i
don't
have
to
in
this
case
mr.
justice
marshall
but
i
suppose
if
the
air
force
could
produce
important
governmental
considerations
which
weighed
into
its
decision
to
fly
supersonic
flights,
thousand
feet
over
washington
--
at
least
its
face,
the
discretionary
function
exemption
of
the
tort
claims
act
would
apply.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
think
we
do.
i
think
precisely
what
dalehite
held
and
precisely
what
the
discretionary
function
exemption
of
the
tort
claims
act
comes
to
tell
us
is
that
the
tort
suits
ought
not
to
be
the
vehicle
by
which
regulations
and
discretionary
activities
either
pursuing
to
regulations
or
otherwise
ought
to
be
reviewed.
now
if
the
regulation
is
negligibly
carried
out
in
someway
then
the
tort
claims
act
covers
the
case
but
precisely
what
that
exemption
meant
to
tell
you
was
that
this
is
not
the
vehicle.
the
tort
claims
act
is
not
the
vehicle
to
review
the
reasonability
of
regulations
or
high
level
government
plans.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
in
fact
that
is
--
i
see
what
the,
if
we
read
the
language
of
26-88,
the
provisions
of
this
chapter
in
section
13-46
(b)
which
is
the
tort
claims
act
shall
not
apply
to
any
claim
based
upon
an
act
or
omission
of
an
employee
of
the
government,
exercising
due
care
in
the
execution
of
a
statute
or
regulation,
whether
or
not
such
statute
or
regulation
be
valid,
or
based
upon
the
exercise
or
performance
or
the
failure
to
exercise
or
perform
a
discretionary
function
or
duty.
in
other
words,
the
congress
has
not
taken
the
risk
of
tort
claim
suits
for
improper
regulations
and
it
has
not
taken
the
risk
of
tort
claim
suits
for
conduct
that
is
not
wrongful
and
this
court
explicitly
says
so
and
after
this
court
read
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
to
to
preclude
relief
in
dalehite,
congress
threw
a
very
extensive
private
relief
bill
setup
an
ad
hoc
commission
which
it
authorized
to
compensate
the
victims
of
the
texas
city
explosion
and
throughout
all
the
debates
that
proceeded
this
relief
provision,
there
was
no
suggestion
whatsoever
of
amending
the
tort
claims
act
in
anyway
that
would
change
the
holding
of
dalehite
decision,
nor
has
there
been
any
such
discussion
since
then.
the
act
still
stands,
it
still
applies
negligent
or
wrongful
activity,
it
still
accepts
liability
arising
from
the
performance
of
discretionary
functions
and
we
believe
that
for
that
reason,
the
decision
below
must
be
reversed
by
this
court.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
court
of
appeals
ordered
that
the
trial
court
was
to
allow
plaintiffs
to
change
their
complaint
around
so
as
to
fit
in,
unjust
taking
provision
under
the
fifth
amendment.
i
suppose
the
government
would
not
oppose
in
principle
a
expansion
of
the
complaint
to
fit
that
ground.
the
complaint
was
rather
un-artfully
drawn,
it
was
a
home
drawn
complaint
and
i
suppose
it
could
be
read
fairly
broadly
to
include
lots
of
claims.
i
think
we
would
definitely
take
the
position
that
the
causby
case
does
not
in
anyway
control
this
case
in
very,
very
different
circumstances
in
causby
and
the
planes
were
flying
50-feet
overhead
constantly
over
the
plaintiff's
property
and
that
was
in
effect
a
constant
easement
that
had
been
taken
from
the
plaintiffs
and
it
was
on
that
basis
that
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
there
had
been
a
compensable
taking.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no
i
don't
think.
this
kind
of
a
very
occasional
infliction
of
damage,
i
think
just
bears
no
resemblance
to
taking
and
i
think
this
court
could
really
take
notice
of
that
but
i
think
i
would
be
hesitant
to
argue
that
the
complaint
was
too
narrow
to
encompass
that
theory.
i
just
think
the
theory
is
virtually
frivolous
in
context
of
this
case.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
which
comes
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
raises
two
important
questions
of
statutory
interpretation
concerning
the
scope
of
the
government's
liability
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
the
issues
in
this
case
are
closely
related
to
and
in
our
opinion,
virtually
controlled
by
the
issues
decided
by
this
court
in
the
landmark
case
of
dalehite
versus
united
states
decided
at
346
us.
in
that
case,
of
course,
the
government
was
held
not
liable
under
the
tort
claims
act
for
damage
caused
in
the
disastrous
explosion
of
certain
chemical
fertilizers
with
it
in
fact
being
transported
by
the
government
for
export
abroad
which
explosion
virtually
devastated
the
city
of
texas.
fortunately,
the
factual
context
to
this
case
is
somewhat
less
ghastly
than
that
which
the
court
confronted
in
dalehite.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that's
right,
but
it
had
been
carried
out
for
suing
to
a
government
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
think,
for
the
most
part
mr.
chief
justice,
it
was
assumed
in
the
decision
that
the
government
had
played
a
sufficiently
close
role
in
entire
process
including
the
planning
of
the
export
and
the
transporting
and
packing
of
the
materials,
that,
that
issue
was,
at
least
that
level
of
responsibility
was
assumed
in
the
opinion.
respondents
or
residents
of
nashville,
north
carolina
which
is
a
rural
community
of
about
1500
inhabitants.
and
respondents
alleged
there
on
several
occasions
and
especially
on
november
14,
1968,
their
house
was
damaged
by
so
called
sonic
booms,
which
put
simply
noisy
vibrations
that
may
occur
when
aircraft
fly
overhead,
it's
speed
greater
than
the
speed
of
sound.
respondent
sought
first
to
recover
from
the
air
force
under
the
administrative
procedures
authorized
by
the
military
pay
claims
act
and
the
air
force
regulations
promulgated
thereunder.
but
the
air
force
engineer
who
investigated
their
house,
concluded
in
a
detailed
report
which
is
reproduced
at
pages
16
and
17
of
the
record,
concluded
that
the
damages
to
respondent's
home
had
indeed
not
been
caused
by
sonic
booms.
respondents
then
sued
the
government
and
the
district
court
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
in
answer
to
their
complaint
and
supporting
affidavits,
corroborating
the
event
of
the
sonic
boom
and
the
relation
of
the
november
14
sonic
boom
to
certain
damages
sustained
by
respondent's
home.
the
government
filed
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
supporting
affidavits.
the
government's
affidavits
acknowledged
that
indeed
the
air
force
had
conducted
a
supersonic
flight
over
the
nashville,
north
carolina
area
on
the
alleged
day
and
that
the
aircraft
and
the
flight
were
attached
to
the
ninth
strategic
reconnaissance
wing
of
the
strategic
air
command.
that
is
a
branch
of
the
air
force
which
is
charged
with
the
execution
of
periodic
high
level
supersonic
training
flights.
these
flights,
i
understand
are
used
for
training
pilots
for
combat
missions
and
are
regulated
by
comprehensive
predetermined
flight
plans.
the
commander-in-chief
of
the
strategic
air
command
general
holloway
who
ranks
for
purposes
of
this
type
of
operations
directly
below
the
joint
chiefs
of
staff,
stated
in
his
affidavit
that
he
directed
the
operational
training
of
air
cruise
by
supersonic
flights.
and
that
the
november
14
flight
was
in
his
words,
“authorized
by
and
conducted
pursuant
to
my
direction”.
other
affidavits
filed
by
high
air
force
personnel
also
stated
that
the
flight
was
at
all
times
on
course,
with
respect
to
location
and
altitude
as
prescribed
by
the
mission
flight
plan
directed
by
the
commander
in
chief
and
this
statement
is,
i
gather
not
controverted
in
any
of
the
record
of
this
case
or
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
nor
it
is
alleged
at
all
that
the
flight
plan
itself
was
in
any
manner
faulty.
the
district
court
granted
the
government's
motion
for
summary
judgment
on
the
authority
of
the
dalehite
case,
on
the
ground
primarily
that
the
planning
and
execution
of
the
flights
in
question
was
a
“discretionary
function”
for
which
the
government
is
specifically
exempted
from
liability
under
section
2688
of
the
tort
claims
act.
and
i
shall
address
myself
to
that
discretionary
function
provision
shortly.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
district
court's
plan
of
summary
judgment
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
discretionary
function
exemption
was
inapplicable
in
this
case
for
reasons
which
as
i
say,
i
shall
refer
to
later.
on
the
merits
of
the
case,
after
getting
over
the
discretionary
function
exemption,
the
court
held
in
direct
contradiction
i
believe
to
this
court's
holding
in
dalehite,
that
even
though
no
negligence
in
the
planning
or
operation
of
the
flight
had
been
alleged
and
no
wrongful
conduct
at
all
had
been
alleged,
the
government
could
still
be
liable
under
the
tort
claims
act
under
a
fury
of
strict
liability
for
engaging
in
ultra
hazardous
activity.
the
government
believes
that
court
of
appeals
erred
in
both
aspects
of
its
holding,
both
respect
to
it's
refusal
to
apply
the
discretionary
function
exemption
and
on
the
merits
in
it's
imposition
of
the
theory
of
absolute
liability
for
the
conduct
of
ultra
hazardous
activity
under
the
tort
claims
act.
and
i
shall
with
the
court's
permission
deal
first
with
the
merits
of
the
case,
that
is,
the
question
whether
the
tort
claims
act
gives
rise
to
government
liability
for
ultra
hazardous
activities
without
finding
a
fault
or
negligence.
as
i
imagine
the
members
of
this
court
are
well
aware
that
tort
claims
act
was
enacted
by
congress
in
1946
and
authorized
for
the
first
time
in
this
country's
history,
a
very
limited
and
well
defined
range
of
tort
actions
which
could
be
brought
against
the
federal
government.
the
issue
whether
the
government
ought
to
waive
its
sovereign
immunity
from
tort
actions
had
been
vigorously
debated
in
virtually
every
congress
since
1990
and
over
30
bills
had
been
introduced
and
extensively
discussed
in
both
houses
of
the
congress.
we
attempt
to
show
throughout
our
brief
in
this
case,
as
we
did
very
extensively
in
our
brief
in
the
dalehite
case.
we
have
put
in
our
brief
here
a
summary
of
extremely
complex
legislative
history
of
this
act.
as
this
court
noted
in
dalehite
the
overwhelming
concern
of
the
congress
throughout
its
discussions
about
whether
to
subject
the
united
states
to
tort
liability
was
the
need
to
provide
compensation
without
resort
to
the
laborious
process
of
private
bills
for
those
who
had
been
injured
by
the
ordinary
common
law
tortuous
acts
of
individual
government
employees
and
agents.
and
the
chief
example
of
such
a
tortuous
act
used
literally
hundreds
of
times
in
the
discussions
is
the
negligent
operation
of
a
motor
vehicle
driven
by
government
employee
in
the
scope
of
his
employment.
indeed
the
house
report
in
the
79th
congress
which
ultimately
passed
the
final
version
of
the
tort
claims
act
noted
the
need
to
ensure
that
the
act
would
“preclude
any
possibility
that
the
bill
might
be
construed
to
authorize
suit
for
damages
growing
out
of
an
authorized
activity
where
no
negligence
on
the
part
of
any
governmental
agent
is
shown
and
the
only
ground
for
suit
is
the
contention
that
the
same
conduct
by
private
individual
would
be
tortuous.”
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that
is
right
mr.
justice
douglas.
there
is
provision
in
the
military
pay
claims
act
which
is
set
out
at
10
usc
2732
and
so
on
by
which
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes,
and
so
in
this
case,
similarly
in
this
case
a
claim
was
filed
to
the
air
force.
what
the
military
pay
claims
act
does
is
authorize
the
air
force
to
establish,
and
there
are
other
branches
of
the
military
through
whom
damage
might
occur
to
civilians
to
institute
procedures
under
which
recovery
might
be
sought
regardless
of
fault.
and
that
administrative
procedure
was
indeed
followed
in
this
case
by
respondents
and
the
air
force
as
i
stated
earlier,
the
air
force
engineer
determined
that
there
was
no
cause
of
connection
in
this
case
between
the
sonic
boom
and
the
damage
inflicted.
as
a
routine
matter,
the
air
force
does
pay
up
to
a
certain
maximum
amount
specified
in
the
military
pay
claims
act,
damages
that
occur
through
sonic
booms,
but
this
is
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
according
to
the
investigative
report,
there
were
no
shattered
windows
here
and
i
gathered
that
the
primary
aspect
to
damage
which
respondents
have
alleged
is
cracking
in
the
walls.
and
the
engineer
noted
in
his
report
a
number
of
reasons
why
he
thought
that
it
was
impossible
that
the
cracking
in
the
walls
of
this
particular
house
could
have
been
caused
by
sonic
boom
and
i
think
the
air
force
takes
position
generally,
that
cracked
glass
is
the
primary
danger
and
that
major
structural
damage
has
really
not
been
proved
yet
to
be
correlated
with
the
sonic
booms,
but
i
think,
that
issue
is
not
present
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that's
right.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
and
the
suit
was
filed
under
the
tort
claims
act
which
is
by
the
very
terms
of
the
military
pay
claims
act,
mutually
exclusive
with
tort
act
liability.
there
is
only,
military
pay
claims
acts
liability
is
only
authorized
in
the
event
that
there
is
no
claim
under
the
tort
claims
act
which
we
believe
incidentally
is
a
recognition
of
the
fact
that
the
tort
claims
act
does
not
cover
liability
in
the
absence
of
some
sort
of
fault
or
wrong.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
under
the
pay
claim
act,
there
is
a
$15,000
maximum
except
in
certain
--
that
can
be
through
certain
special
procedures
can
be
waived,
if
necessary.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no,
there
has
to
be
a
determination
that
there
would
not
be
liability
under
the
tort
claims
act
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that's
right,
that's
right.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
exactly.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no,
we
are
not
suggesting,
i
don't
think
anything
in
that
nature.
we
are
suggesting
that
respondent
has
failed
successfully
to
achieve
a
remedy
through
the
administrative
process
authorized
by
the
military
pay
claims
act
that
he
is
now
suing
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
and
that,
that
act
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no,
i
don't
believe
he
did.
we
would
not
argue
with
any
exhaustion
principle.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
mutually
exclusive,
that's
right.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that's
congress
who
said
that,
that's
10
u.s.c.
2733
(b).
mr.
richard
b.
stone
tort
claims
act,
that's
right.
let
me
get
back
to
the
language
of
the
tort
claims
act
itself,
even
though
negligence
was
the
major
concern,
we
of
course,
acknowledged
that
the
act
was
worded
not
truly
in
terms
of
negligence
but
rather
in
terms
of
injury
caused
by
the
negligent
or
wrongful
act
or
mission
of
any
employee
under
circumstances
that
may
give
rise
to
state
liability.
in
the
view
of
the
court
of
appeals,
the
addition
of
the
word
wrongful,
and
that
is
the
important
word
for
purposes
of
this
case,
means
the
congress
intended
to
waive
the
immunity
from
tort
action
by
the
government
for
any
act
which
would
be
grounds
for
tort
suit
under
the
law
of
the
state,
where
the
act
in
question
occurred,
and
since
a
person
maybe
liable
in
north
carolina
to
a
tort
suit
for
ultra
hazardous
activity
without
any
question
of
fault,
the
court
reasons
that
the
government
is
correspondingly
liable
here
and
disregarding
the
question
of
whether
operation
of
supersonic
flights
constitutes
an
ultra
hazardous
activity
which
i
don't
believe
the
court
properly
determined,
which
in
any
event
what
i
think
require
a
fact
finding
proceeding
of
some
sort.
we
believe
the
court
was
in
very
serious
error
when
it
read
the
word,
wrongful,
in
the
tort
claims
act,
to
apply
to
absolute
liability
for
ultra
hazardous
activity.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
now
there
are
two
different
problems
here,
there
is
both
the
discretionary
function
problem
which
i
shall
get
to
and
the
question
whether
there
was
any
wrongful
and
negligent
act.
both,
in
order
for
there
to
be
federal
tort
claim
act
liability,
both
of
those
conditions
have
to
be
fulfilled.
there
has
to
be
a
non-discretionary
function
by
a
federal
employee
and
there
has
to
be
a
wrongful
or
negligent
act.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
then
your
only
remedy
is
from
the
air
force
administrative
procedure.
our
essential
position
in
this
case
is,
i
think
it
is
hornbook
tort
law
that
strict
or
absolute
liability
for
the
conduct
of
an
ultra
hazardous
activity
is
imposed
not
because
a
person
has
engaged
in
conduct
which
is
in
any
way
negligent
or
wrongful,
but
merely
because
the
activity
is
one
which
poses
a
likelihood
of
damage
regardless
of
a
level
of
care
exercised
and
as
the
commentators,
i
think,
unanimously
agree,
it
is
the
unique
characteristic
of
this
type
of
liability
that
it
is
imposed
not
because
of
a
wrongful
act
but
because
of
a
policy
judgment
that
the
person
who
engages
in
an
ultrahazardous
activity
should
bear
the
risk
of
harm
caused
by
that
activity.
and
whatever
the
word
wrongful
means,
in
addition
to
the
word
negligence,
it
simply
makes
no
sense
to
say
that
an
act
is
wrongful
because
it
gives
rise
to
liability
under
state
law,
especially
when
the
underlying
assumption
of
that
state
law
is
not
that
the
conduct
is
wrongful
but
on
the
contrary,
that
it
is
being
to
give
rise
to
liability
for
policy
reasons
in
spite,
explicitly
in
spite
of
its
not
being
wrongful.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
to
my
knowledge
mr.
chief
justice
there
are
not
so
far,
but
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
to
my
knowledge,
it
is
a
problem
that
has
been
exclusively
here
in
the
domain
of
military
aircraft
but
if
that
is
not
in
the
record,
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question
whether
--
i
am
quite
certain
that
there
are
private
companies
which
are
engaged
in
building
the
planes
that
can
fly
at
more
than
supersonic
speeds
but
whether
they
are
being
used
for
any
other
than
military
purposes,
i
don't
know.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that's
right.
what
i
understand
is
that
there
are
plans
for
the
use
of
planes
flying
at
these
sonic
boom
oriented
speeds
by
private
industry,
but
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
evidence
that
they
are
yet
flying.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
don't
know.
i
would
conclude
this
portion
of
the
argument
by
referring
to
the
very
extensive
legislative
history
of
the
act
which
we
discussed
for
these
purposes
at
pages
13-16
of
our
brief,
which
indicate
that
the
word
negligence
was
intended
to
cover
the
great
bulk
of
cases
brought
under
the
statute
and
the
word
wrongful
was
quite
explicitly
meant
to
have
a
very,
very
narrow
purpose
of
primarily
including
certain
kinds
of
trespass
which
were
not
necessarily
negligent
and
this
court
in
dalehite,
very
explicitly
agreed
with
this
reading
of
the
legislative
history.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
it
excludes
most
intentional
wrong,
section
2680
(f),
i
think,
it
is,
quite
explicitly
excludes
assaults
and
false
imprisonments
and
intentional
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
those
deliberate
torts
which
are
excluded
are
excluded
by
name
and
trespass,
deliberate
trespass
is
not
excluded.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
within
wrongful,
that's
right.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
think
that's
precisely
the
kind
of
situation
which
gives
rise
to
strict
liability
for
ultrahazardous
activity
where
there
is
a
statistical
certainty
that
at
some
point
if
you
continue
to
carry
on
this
activity,
some
kind
of
damage
will
occur,
but
it
is
considered
inherently
a
reasonable
activity
to
perform,
and
liability
is
considered
to
be
imposed
regardless
of
any
fault.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
this
is
a
question
that's
raised
in
all
the
commentaries
with
respect
to
where
the
strict
liability
is
an
intentional
tort.
i
don't
think
that
plays
into
the
tort
claims
act
in
any
event
because
the
exceptions
in
the
tort
claims
act
are
not
too
intentional
torts
by
category
but
to
certain
specific
torts
all
of
which
are
intentional.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
think,
that's
right,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
and
the
mere
fact
that
he
intended
to
do
the
act
and
knew
that
it
was
a
statistical
probability
indeed,
a
statistical
certainty
that
some
damage
would
ultimately
occur,
is
not,
i
think,
been
considered
by
any
of
the
commentators
to
be
an
intentional
tort
for
proser
and
restatement
of
torts
by
categorization
purposes
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
and
we
say
not
wrongful
and
this
court
quite
specifically
in
dalehite
said
that
activity
of
this
nature
was
not
wrongful
and
that
was
not
dealing
with
sonic
booms
but
it
was
dealing
with
this
broad
category
which
is
defined
in
terms
of
a
relative
certainty
that
some
sort
of
damage
will
occur.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
have
not
been
mr.
justice
douglas.
i
understand
that's
one
of
the
more
unpleasant
aspects
of
a
sonic
booms.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
mr.
justice
douglas,
there
are
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
there
indeed
is
the
question
as
to
who
should
suffer
the
loss,
in
this
situation
and
in
many
situations
in
which
many
governmental
activity
regardless
of
finding
a
fault
or
wrong
causes
damage
to
an
individual.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
the
congress
has
not
chosen
to
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that's
exactly
right
mr.
justice
brennan,
but
the
tort
claims
act
in
very
specific
terms
says
that
the
activity
must
be
wrongful
and
this
court
in
dalehite
very
explicitly
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
oh,
it's
--
yeah,
i
am
told
that
it's
not.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
whether
north
carolina
law
categorizes
this
as
a
trespass.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
we
have
a
reference
in
our
petition
to
north
carolina
general
statute
6314,
this
is
on
the
footnote
on
page
26
of
the
petition
and
i
think
that
the
reason
we
have
not
gone
into
this
in
detail
in
north
carolina
law
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
which
held
in
respondent's
favor
assumed
that
the
theory
of
north
carolina
law
which
it
was
based
in
its
holding
of
tort
claims
act
liability
on
was
a
strict,
conventional
strict-liability
for
hazardous
activity
theory
and
not
a
trespass
theory.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
oh,
excuse
me,
let
me
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
let
me
answer
the
question
by
saying
that
i
don't
think
--
i
think
that
the
kind
of
trespass,
even
a
trespass
would
have
to
be
wrongful
in
some
sense.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
think
unless
there
is
some
element
of
thought
even
though
it
can
be
labeled
a
trespass,
it's
not
necessarily
wrongful.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
it's
tortious.
it
maybe
tortious
but
it
is
not
necessarily
wrongful.
and
in
any
event,
excuse
me.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
i
would
suggest
that
we
don't
know
whether
north
carolina
law
specifically
hold
this
on.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
it
would
be
rather
importance
but
it's
not.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that
i
gather
has
been
held
in
different
ways
in
circuits
that
if
a
falling
which
is
--
a
falling
which
occurs,
regardless
of
fault,
i
think
we
would
argue,
it's
still
not
a
compensable
necessarily
under
the
tort
claims
act.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that's
right
mr.
justice
white,
we'd
say
that
that
was
not
a
wrongful,
not
a
wrongful
act
by
a
federal
employee.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
believe
mr.
chief
justice,
that
that's
the
praylou
case
and
indeed
that
case
was
decided
very
shortly
after
dalehite,
and
this
court
held
that
--
this
court
denied
certiorari
in
the
case.
the
fourth
circuit
held
that
there
was
liability
but
one
of
the
theories
argued
in
that
case,
was
the
theory
of
(inaudible)
and
that
when
this
court
denied
certiorari,
the
papers
before
the
court
emphasized
heavily
that
the
theory
of
(inaudible)was
in
the
case,
so
that
in
effect
negligence
was
alleged
and
we
have
always
assumed
that
the
court
denied
certiorari
for
primarily
because
there
was
a
problem
of
negligence
and
not
an
understanding
that
dalehite
was
being
quietly
reversed
four
months
later
on
it's
holding
that
there
was
no
absolute
liability.
mr.
justice
stewart,
let
me
add
to
your
question
that
i
simply
don't
know
precisely
how
--
i
have
taken
this
on
the
assumption
that
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
interpreted
north
carolina
laws
especially
since
the
court
of
appeals
held
for
respondent's
on
a
theory,
most
favorable
to
them,
and
i
haven't
looked
any
further
into
it
but
i
would
certainly
be
happy
to
make
a
further
submission
about
north
carolina
law
if
the
court
beams
at
questions
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
we'd
be
happy
to
address
ourselves
to
this
question
in
a
supplemental
--
i
see,
i
have
right
at
the
time
and
i
have
not
yet
gotten
to
the
second
question
which
is
whether
the
tort
claims
act
precludes
recovery
on
the
basis
of
the
section
2680a
exemption
for
discretionary
functions.
i
would
say
in
brief
that
i
think
that
the
fact
that
this
activity
inherently,
the
planning
operation
of
this
flight
was
inherently
a
discretionary
function
within
the
meaning
of
a
2680
exemption,
is
un-controverted
by
anyone
in
this
case
including
respondents
and
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
activity
was
inherently
discretionary,
follows
very
much
a
fortiori
from
the
dalehite
case.
the
ground
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
refused
to
apply
the
discretionary
function
exemption,
was
not
that
the
activities
were
not
discretionary
but
that
the
discretion
was
moved
by
the
air
force
regulation
5534
which
is
reprinted
as
appendix
c
to
our
petition
and
that
is
indeed
the
regulation
promulgated
pursuant
to
the
military
claims
act,
which
deals
with
procedures
applicable
to
super
sonic
flights
and
recovery
for
super
sonic
flights.
and
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that,
that
regulation
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
discretionary
nature
of
the
activities
involved
in
this
case.
the
court
cited
specifically
two
aspects
of
regulation
5534.
it
first
noted
that
the
regulation
instructs
the
air
force
to
assure
“maximum
protection
for
civilian
communities
in
carrying
out
the
flights,”
and
from
this
the
court
appears
to
have
a
reason
that
if
any
damage
to
a
civilian
occurs,
the
conduct
of
the
flight
in
some
way,
loses
its
discretionary
nature.
the
short
answer
to
this
contention
and
i
think
there
are
several
other
answers
also
is
that
that
the
provision
for
maximum
protection
of
civilians
is
in
its
own
words
made
applicable
only
wherever
or
whenever
feasible
and
accordingly
flights
are
required
to
avoid
populated
areas,
“as
much
as
possible”,
language
which
on
its
face
leaves
the
air
force
with
considerable
discretion
and
which
is
not
even
alleged
to
have
been
abused
in
this
case.
and
in
addition
of
course,
i
don't
think
that
that
regulation
could
have
changed,
widened
the
scope
of
government
liability
under
the
tort
claims
act
anyway.
the
court
also
refused
to
apply
the
discretionary
function
exemption
on
the
ground
that
the
regulation
specifies
that
“the
air
force
must
accept
the
responsibility,”
for
damage
caused
by
sonic
boom
and
from
this,
the
court
reasoned
that
there
is
no
discretion
to
fly
supersonic
airplane
without
compensating
injured
civilians.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
this
aspect
of
the
lower
court’s
holding
is
really
plain
on
words
because
whatever
discretion
the
air
force
has
to
under
its
own
regulations
to
pay
or
refuse,
to
pay
damages
to
injured
persons
has
nothing
to
do
with
discretionary
function
provision
of
the
tort
claims
act,
which
relates
only
to
the
nature
of
the
activity
engaged
in
and
not
to
the
obligation
to
pay
a
claim.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
i
would
add
again
that
i
don't
think
air
force
regulations
dealing
with
repayment
of
claims
can
confer
tort
claim
act
jurisdiction
on
the
federal
courts
in
cases
which
are
specifically
excluded
from
jurisdiction
by
that
act.
when
respondents
sought
relief
from
the
act,
from
the
air
force
pursuant
to
this
regulation,
as
i
said
earlier
that
the
air
force
engineer
who
investigated
the
damaged
of
premises
concluded
that
the
damage
was
really
far
smaller
in
amount
than
respondents
had
claimed
and
then
in
any
event
it
was
not
the
type
of
damage
that
could
be
caused
by
sonic
boom.
and
i
think
one
suspects
that
the
court
below
was
motivated
in
this
case
essentially
by
fueling
that
the
government
ought
to
bear
the
risk
of
damage
caused
by
its
operation
of
supersonic
flights,
and
indeed
i
suppose
the
theory
would
extend
to
the
risk
of
most
any
government
operation
in
which
there
was
some
likelyhood
of
damaged
being
imposed
or
even
in
which
damage
was
inflicted
at
all.
congress
has
simply
not
chosen
and
deliberately
not
chosen
to
undertake
this
kind
of
risk.
prior
to
1946
as
i
said,
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
don't
want
to
go
all
that
distance
of
course,
i
don't
have
to
in
this
case
mr.
justice
marshall
but
i
suppose
if
the
air
force
could
produce
important
governmental
considerations
which
weighed
into
its
decision
to
fly
supersonic
flights,
thousand
feet
over
washington
--
at
least
its
face,
the
discretionary
function
exemption
of
the
tort
claims
act
would
apply.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
think
we
do.
i
think
precisely
what
dalehite
held
and
precisely
what
the
discretionary
function
exemption
of
the
tort
claims
act
comes
to
tell
us
is
that
the
tort
suits
ought
not
to
be
the
vehicle
by
which
regulations
and
discretionary
activities
either
pursuing
to
regulations
or
otherwise
ought
to
be
reviewed.
now
if
the
regulation
is
negligibly
carried
out
in
someway
then
the
tort
claims
act
covers
the
case
but
precisely
what
that
exemption
meant
to
tell
you
was
that
this
is
not
the
vehicle.
the
tort
claims
act
is
not
the
vehicle
to
review
the
reasonability
of
regulations
or
high
level
government
plans.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
in
fact
that
is
--
i
see
what
the,
if
we
read
the
language
of
26-88,
the
provisions
of
this
chapter
in
section
13-46
(b)
which
is
the
tort
claims
act
shall
not
apply
to
any
claim
based
upon
an
act
or
omission
of
an
employee
of
the
government,
exercising
due
care
in
the
execution
of
a
statute
or
regulation,
whether
or
not
such
statute
or
regulation
be
valid,
or
based
upon
the
exercise
or
performance
or
the
failure
to
exercise
or
perform
a
discretionary
function
or
duty.
in
other
words,
the
congress
has
not
taken
the
risk
of
tort
claim
suits
for
improper
regulations
and
it
has
not
taken
the
risk
of
tort
claim
suits
for
conduct
that
is
not
wrongful
and
this
court
explicitly
says
so
and
after
this
court
read
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
to
to
preclude
relief
in
dalehite,
congress
threw
a
very
extensive
private
relief
bill
setup
an
ad
hoc
commission
which
it
authorized
to
compensate
the
victims
of
the
texas
city
explosion
and
throughout
all
the
debates
that
proceeded
this
relief
provision,
there
was
no
suggestion
whatsoever
of
amending
the
tort
claims
act
in
anyway
that
would
change
the
holding
of
dalehite
decision,
nor
has
there
been
any
such
discussion
since
then.
the
act
still
stands,
it
still
applies
negligent
or
wrongful
activity,
it
still
accepts
liability
arising
from
the
performance
of
discretionary
functions
and
we
believe
that
for
that
reason,
the
decision
below
must
be
reversed
by
this
court.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
court
of
appeals
ordered
that
the
trial
court
was
to
allow
plaintiffs
to
change
their
complaint
around
so
as
to
fit
in,
unjust
taking
provision
under
the
fifth
amendment.
i
suppose
the
government
would
not
oppose
in
principle
a
expansion
of
the
complaint
to
fit
that
ground.
the
complaint
was
rather
un-artfully
drawn,
it
was
a
home
drawn
complaint
and
i
suppose
it
could
be
read
fairly
broadly
to
include
lots
of
claims.
i
think
we
would
definitely
take
the
position
that
the
causby
case
does
not
in
anyway
control
this
case
in
very,
very
different
circumstances
in
causby
and
the
planes
were
flying
50-feet
overhead
constantly
over
the
plaintiff's
property
and
that
was
in
effect
a
constant
easement
that
had
been
taken
from
the
plaintiffs
and
it
was
on
that
basis
that
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
there
had
been
a
compensable
taking.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no
i
don't
think.
this
kind
of
a
very
occasional
infliction
of
damage,
i
think
just
bears
no
resemblance
to
taking
and
i
think
this
court
could
really
take
notice
of
that
but
i
think
i
would
be
hesitant
to
argue
that
the
complaint
was
too
narrow
to
encompass
that
theory.
i
just
think
the
theory
is
virtually
frivolous
in
context
of
this
case.
