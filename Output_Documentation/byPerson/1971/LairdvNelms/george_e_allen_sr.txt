mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
don't
think
i
am
going
to
need
the
five
additional
minutes,
unless
i
am
asked
a
lot
of
questions,
a
lot
of
time
is
consumed
in
that
duration.
upon
reading
the
comprehensive
brief
of
the
government,
and
the
learned
and
able
and
my
distinguished
friend
here,
inquiring
in
the
minds
of
the
congressmen
who
have
enacted
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
they've
filled
references
and
quotations
to
the
congressional
record,
rather
inconclusive
of
the
intentions
of
the
congressmen,
reminds
me
of
the
observation
of
the
great
chief
justice
marshall
in
the
case
gibbons
against
ogden
in
which
he
said,
“powerful
and
ingenious
minds
by
course
of
well
digested
but
refined
metaphysical
reason.”
so
entangled
and
the
work,
the
understand
as
to
obscure
the
principles
which
were
before
“complaint”.
an
induced
doubts
where
(inaudible)to
follow
its
own
common
sense
of
course,
not
even
be
perceived.
in
such
a
case,
he
said,
we
should
recur
to
commonsense
fundamental
principles
and
diverse
principles
to
test
their
own,
examine
the
arguments
that
are
to
be
tested.
now
let
us
follow
that
advice.
this
case
is
not
as
difficult
as
my
good
friends
on
the
other
side
would
have
us
believe.
reduced
to
its
simplest
analysis,
it
is
just
this.
nelms
(inaudible)
at
the
foothills
of
north
carolina
in
a
home
which
is
not
a
mansion,
that
is
all
the
home
they
have.
the
federal
government
conducting
training
missions
with
supersonic
planes
from
california
to
north
carolina,
pass
over
his
house
at
a
distance,
i
don't
know
what
the
distance
was,
but
it
was
close
enough
so
the
sonic
booms
generated
to
hit
the
man's
house
like
a
(inaudible).
they
shattered
the
walls,
they
broke
the
windows
and
the
damage
was
so
extensive
that
barely
the
contractor
said,
it
will
cost
more
to
repair
the
house
than
to
rebuild
it.
nelms
seeking
damages
to
rebuild
his
home,
filed
suit
in
a
district
court
in
north
carolina.
that
court
followed
the
theories
of
the
government
and
dismissed
the
complaint.
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
yes
sir,
they
appear
in
affidavits
that
were
filed.
we've
never
had
any
trial
on
that
issue,
in
fact.
nelms
was
a
poor
man,
too
poor
to
afford
a
counsel,
so
in
the
district
court
employed
--
asked
the
local
counsel
to
represent
him.
after
the
decision
was
against
nelms,
he
appealed
to
the
fourth
circuit
at
richmond
in
propria
persona
and
when
the
case
got
there,
chief
judge
hemsworth
asked
the
clerk
of
the
court
to
call
and
asked
if
i
would
represent
nelms
in
that
court
saying
that
he
felt
it
was
a
type
of
case
that
i
would
relate.
of
course,
i
agreed.
they
have
refused,
the
point
we
made,
for
a
court
represent
an
innocent
person.
so
i
walked
down
to
the
clerk's
office,
examined
the
record
and
then
i
found
myself
87
years
old,
semi-retired,
trying
to
get
out
of
it,
in
the
midst
of
the
one
of
the
biggest
questions
of
the
day.
well
of
course,
the
first
thing,
i
did
was
to
look
at
the
federal
tort
claims
act
and
of
course,
i
found
that
it
provides
that
the
government
shall
be
liable
just
as
an
individual
would
be
under
like
circumstances
and
liable
according
to
the
law
of
the
piece
where
the
act
of
omission
took
place.
naturally
then,
i
would
tend
to
see
what
north
carolina
law
was,
and
i
found
that
north
carolina
had
adopted
the
uniform
aeronautics
act
which
provides
a
strict
liability,
that
is
liability
without
negligence.
the
north
carolina
statutes
are
set
out
in
the
appendix
to
our
response
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
and
have
been
put
and
reference
in
our
brief
is
made
to
that
appendix.
then
i
found
another
thing,
that
the
air
force
itself
which
is
home
of
of
the
federal
government,
which
is
the
defendant
in
this
case
had
no
need
of
regulations,
case
resulted
in
the
same
liability
that
the
statutes
of
north
carolina
had
created.
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
sorry.
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
no,
sir,
no
sir.
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
no,
sir
they
are
not.
they
are
set
out
in
the
record
in
this
case,
and
the
regulation
itself
is
mentioned
by
judge
butzner
in
his
opinion.
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
yes
sir.
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
that's
right.
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
that's
right,
that's
what
judge
butzner
had
--
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
that's
right.
now
not
withstanding
the
laws
that
i
have
mentioned,
the
government
claims
that
is
not
liable,
because
of
this
discretionary
function
in
the
statute
and
it
is
our
claim
supported
by
an
abundance
of
authority
cases
cited
in
the
brief
that
neither
the
government
nor
an
agency
of
the
government
has
any
discretion
to
violate
the
positive
law
of
a
state.
it's
outside
of
anyone's
discretion.
i
think
judge
parker,
the
late
john
j.
parker
who
by
the
way
was
really
the
greatest
appellate
judges
that
ever
sat
on
the
appellate
court
in
this
country.
i
know
because
i
already
ran
a
case
before
him.
he
should
have
been
approved
when
he
was
nominated
for
this
court.
but
people
defeated
him.
now
judge
parker,
i
might
be
a
little
bit
inaccurate,
so
i
am
afraid
exactly
what
he
had
in
the
praylou
case.
the
praylou
case
went
up
as
i
recall
from
south
carolina
and
south
carolina
had
adapted
the
same
rule
universal,
uniform
aeronautics
act
of
north
carolina,
and
therefore
the
court
had
referred
in
that
case
the
exact
question
that
we
have
for
before
here,
and
judge
parker
said
or
held
this,
congress
did
not
intend
to
exclude
from
coverage
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act
liability
arising
from
operation
of
government
aircraft
merely
because
under
the
state
law
liability
for
entry
was
made
absolute
and
not
the
dependent
upon
negligence.
nor
did
congress
intend
the
that
there
should
be
a
liability,
in
states
where
a
liability
under
the
state
law
is
based
on
negligence
and
no
liability
in
the
great
majority
of
states
which
have
adapted
a
uniform
aeronautics
act.
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
that's
the
praylou
case
from
the
first
--
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
no
sir,
i
don't
think
that's
this
case.
this
case
arose
in
south
carolina,
of
course
they
applied
the
south
carolina
law.
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
yes,
we
have
a
citation.
it's
in
the
--
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
it's
208
federal
2nd
cited
in
our
brief
on
page
10,
of
our
brief.
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
our
brief
is
a
readmission.
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
now
this
court
refused
certiorari
in
the
praylou
case.
well,
i
know
that
they
say
you
don't
need
anything
to
refuse
certiorari,
but
it
does
mean
something
in
some
cases
because
if
the
decision
in
praylou
on
the
identical
question
was
as
erroneous
and
would
disastrous
to
the
federal
government
as
the
government
claims
now
that
it
would
be
in
the
nelms
case,
i
am
sure,
somewhere
would
have
this
honorable
court
would
assess
it
and
grant
it
certiorari.
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
afterwards.
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
now,
when
the
nelms
case
came
before
the
fourth
circuit,
what
was
that
court
supposed
to
do?
an
identical
question
had
been
raised
and
decided
in
the
praylou
case
and
this
court
had
refused
certiorari.
this
court
had
led
the
decision
stand,
surely
there
was
nothing
for
the
fourth
circuit
to
do
except
to
follow
the
praylou
case,
which
it
did.
this
court
in
what
is
known
as
the
famous
chicken
case,
the
federal
tort
claims
act
was
enacted,
decided
that
government
planes
passing
over
a
farmer's
chicken
farm,
frightened
the
chicken
so
that
they
would
fly
up
against
the
walls
of
the
buildings
and
(inaudible)
and
some
of
the
hens
will
stop
laying
and
those
few
that
continued
to
lay,
their
eggs
were
worthless
for
raising
the
chickens,
no
doubt
because
the
males
were
so
frightened
that
they
couldn't
perform
their
duties
in
fertilizing
days.
now
this
high
court
held
in
that
case
that
according
to
the
fifth
amendment
that
man
was
entitled
to
compensation,
although
not
one
square
foot
of
his
property
was
taken.
they
said
that
it
was
practiclaly
disturbed
for
the
purpose
of
raising
chickens.
now
according
to
the
argument
of
the
government,
nelms
would
have
been
better
off
if
the
federal
tort
claims
act
haven't
been
passed.
he
will
have
some
chance
to
recover
under
the
fifth
amendment.
and
now
i
want
to
have
something
to
say
in
passing
there
for
regulation.
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
i
don't
think
it
can
do
it,
sir.
i
think
an
act
of
congress
can't
affect
--
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
sorry.
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
no,
not
at
all.
i
only
meant
to
say
that
if
we
try
to
recover
on
to
the
tort
claims
act,
we
would
have
been
better
off
to
haven't
given
the
tort
claims
act.
that's
in
the
fifth
amendment,
no
sir.
now
we
will
come
to
that
in
an
another
connection
little
bit
later.
just
a
word
about
these
regulations.
a
federal
statute
authorizes
the
president
of
the
united
states
as
command
in
chief
of
the
army
and
navy,
to
make
regulations
of
the
army,
navy,
and
air
force.
of
course,
he
doesn't
actually
make
them
himself,
he
delegates
that
to
respective
agencies,
in
this
case
the
air
force.
but
when
the
courts
hold
that
they
are
presumed
to
have
been
made
by
the
president
and
they
have
the
force
of
law,
feeling
and
i
might
not
have
time
to
complete
my
brief,
i
have
decided
to
write
a
brief
on
that
issue
before
i
received
the
government's
brief.
we
found
31
cases,
three
from
this
high
court,
holding
that
regulations
of
that
type
have
the
force
of
law.
we
found
one
the
ward
(ph)
case
making
particularly
a
scrap
of
paper
out
of
a
regulation,
the
ward
case
was
a
district
court
case
in
pennsylvania.
so
lo
and
behold,
when
i
got
the
brief
of
the
government,
they
cited
the
ward
case.
we
had
cited
in
our
brief,
because
along
the
cases
we
found
two
of
those
claims
were
made
to
us,
but
we
cited
all
other
cases.
they
cited
the
ward
case.
they
decided
one
above
all
of
these
other
cases,
(inaudible)
that
this
court
had
decided.
perhaps
the
gentlemen
belonging
to
that
school
of
thought
that
the
last
cases
have
any
relevance
or
importance
and
they
stopped
where
the
last
advent
cheat
of
a
larger
system
and
looked
back.
in
the
first
case
they
find
(inaudible).
now
dean
palm
(ph)
told
us
that
you
might
as
well
read
throw
your
whole
law
books
that's
just
been
in
the
shelf
for
30
years,
but
you
didn't
lend
it
back
to
one.
now,
of
course
the
(inaudible)
case,
i
understand,
it
is
before
the
third
circuit
and
that
the
third
circuit
is
awaiting
the
decision
of
this
court
in
this
case
before
it
decides
the
ward
case.
i
want
to
pay
my
respects
to
the
famous
dalehite
case,
of
course
the
lawyers
were
depleted.
i
had
been
the
defendant
against
them
in
that
case.
500
and
some
persons
were
killed
and
millions
of
dollars
worth
of
property
was
destroyed
and
hundreds
of
persons
injured.
now
the
amount
of
the
damage
ought
not
to
have
had
anything
to
do
with
the
decision,
but
apparently
it
did.
but
aside
from
that
in
the
dalehite
case
there
was
no
statute
involved
as
a
guide
to
the
court
and
there
was
no
regulation
involved
as
a
guide
to
the
court.
and
according
to
the
court's
own
reading
the
ultrahazardous
doctrine
didn't
apply,
because
the
court
found
that
the
explosion
was
a
result
of
an
accident,
hear
what
i
am
saying,
absolutely
unforeseeable
by
the
exercise
of
the
(inaudible).
so
nothing
has
been
put
in
--
exercise
of
ordinary
care.
i
don't
think
the
case
has
any
control
over
the
issues
in
this
case
and
that's
was
judge
butzner
said,
judge
butzner
of
the
fourth
circuit,
who
might
approach
this
case
from
another
angle.
we
know
that
the
federal
government
has
no
powers
except
those
granted
in
the
constitution
either
expressed
it
or
by
necessary
implication.
now,
we
have
a
federal
statute
and
a
state
statute
on
the
same
subject.
what
are
we
to
do?
we
are
required
by
the
law
to
examine
both
statutes
and
if
they
are
not
irreconcilably
--
if
they
are
not
wholly
irreconcilable,
then
we
must
-–
what
i
am
saying,
we
must
construe
the
two
statutes
so
as
to
let
them
both
stand
if
we
can,
and
you
have
a
unique
situation
here.
the
federal
statute
actually
creates
for
word
of
action
under
the
state
law,
because
it
says
that
the
federal
government
will
be
liable,
if
any
individual
in
the
state
(inaudible)
and
it
says
further
that
the
liability
must
be
according
to
the
state
law,
then
you
have
the
discretion
that
i
am
referring
to
in
the
federal
statute.
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
that,
when
you
come
to
construe
the
statutes?
remember,
a
lot
of
times,
the
limited
powers
of
the
federal
government
and
the
unlimited
powers
of
the
state
government
except
as
they
are
restricted
by
federal
constitution
and
its
own
constitution
and
by
federal
statute
authorized
by
the
federal
constitution.
you
will
have
to
construe
the
discretionary
function
provision
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act
to
the
effect
that
there
is
no
discretion
on
the
power
of
the
federal
government
or
any
agency
of
the
federal
government
or
any
person
representing
the
federal
government,
no
discretion
to
violate
the
positive
unambiguous
state
law.
then
both
statutes
can
live
together.
now,
that
construction
in
my
own
judgment
would
be
more
in
keeping
with
the
intention
of
the
congress
to
spread
the
liability
over
all
of
the
taxpayers
instead
of
requiring
the
poor
taxpayer
who
sustained
the
loss
to
bear
it
all.
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
i
don't
think
that
the
federal
government
has
any
right
even
for
the
benefit
in
war
times
and
any
other
times
to
destroy
a
property
and
put
the
burden
of
all
damage
on
that
property
only
rather
than
on
all
the
people
through
taxes
letting
all
the
citizens
bear
it.
i
don't
think
they
would
have
a
right
to
do
that.
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
yes
sir,
it
would.
in
many
instance
has
the
government
any
discretion
to
take
property
or
destroy
a
property,
without
claim.
they
are
prohibited
by
the
first
amendment
to
the
constitution.
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
well.
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
that's
right,
it
certainly
is,
but
still
if
they
destroy
the
property
of
a
private
person,
you
have
being
destroy
for
public
purposes,
private
property
being
destroyed
for
public
purposes,
without
compensation.
it's
just
a
question
of
magnitude,
suppose
a
government
tank
runs
over
a
house.
i
will
illustrate
this
again.
when
i
first
came
to
the
bar,
we
have
a
--
the
highway
commission
was
vested
with
absolute
and
uncontrollable
discretion
to
run
highways
to
new...
but
there
was
another
law
which
provided
that
they
could
run
a
highway
through
a
man's
(inaudible).
now
they
couldn't
exercise
that
uncontrollable
discretion
and
violated
that
other
statute.
so
anyway
you
look
at,
you
would
see
rules
of
law
and
your
discretion
can't
be
exercised
in
violation
of
rules
--
positive
rules
and
you
had
the
law
in
dalehite
case
–
you
had
no
rules
of
that
kind,
no
statutes
or
anything
of
that
kind.
you
had
nothing
but
the
ultra
hazardous
act,
and
of
course
that
wasn't
up
further
in
view,
fine
use
of
fact
that
the
court
made.
just
before,
after
i
had
written
our
brief
in
this
case,
a
few
days
before
i
left
home,
i
came
across
my
desk,
two
articles
written
on
the
nelms
case.
one
from
the
new
york
law
review,
from
university
of
new
york
and
other
from
students
in
university
of
washington,
at
seattle.
i
read
those
two
articles
with
a
great
deal
of
interest.
there
we
have
a
younger
generation
taking
a
new
look
at
the
situation
and
i
became
more
convinced
than
ever
of
the
confusion
that
exists
in
this
country
in
reference
to
the
torts
claims
act
and
particularly
the
discretionary
function.
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
well,
i
have
one
of
them,
sir.
i
have
the
new
york.
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
now,
the
one
from
washington
state,
the
only
citation,
i
can
give
there
is
the
name
of
the
two
gentlemen
that
wrote
it.
it
seems
that
they
wrote
the
brief
in
the
court
argument
case.
now
the
federal
--
the
new
york
review,
i
don't
think
it's
out
yet,
but
it
will
be
published
in
the
april
issue
of
the
new
york
university
law
review
and
the
title
of
it
is
federal
torts
claims
act.
the
government
maybe
is
strictly
liable
to
a
homeowner
for
damage
resulting
from
a
sonic
boom
(inaudible).
there
was
a
very
good
discussion
there
and
the
other
case
is
a
brief
written
by
--
i
have
the
name
here
somewhere
--
two
students
(inaudible)
i
have
the
given
them
down
to
the
clerk,
you
can
take
them
down.
now
after
reading
those
articles
as
i
said,
i
was
more
convinced
than
ever
of
the
predicament
we
are
in,
and
the
state
of
confusion
we
are
in
on
this
subject.
and
i
am
going
to
offer
this
solutions
which
is
the
only
one
i
think
of,
that
will
clear
up
in
that,
and
it
would
be
in
harmony,
i
think
with
the
intention
of
the
congress.
that
is
wherever
that
is
a
state
statute
fixing
the
liabilities
or
even
a
regulation
of
the
air
force
which
is
a
part
of
the
government,
then
they
take
this
discretionary
function
provision
out
of
the
area
of
discretion
and
the
government
should
pay
it.
now
neither
the
rules
require
merely
indicate
to
this
honorable
court
what
action
i
think
it
should
take.
what
special
relief
i
believe,
where
the
rule
says,
i
think
the
fourth
circuit
should
be
affirmed
in
its
ruling
on
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
and
the
case
remanded
for
trial
to
court
on
the
question
of
proximate
cause
and
damages,
and
that
as
to
the
fifth
amendment,
the
case
should
be
remanded
with
trial
before
the
court
with
a
jury,
if
we
make
a
submissible
case
on
the
question
of
taking
with
private
property
for
public
purposes
without
compensations,
and
i
thank
you.
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
don't
think
i
am
going
to
need
the
five
additional
minutes,
unless
i
am
asked
a
lot
of
questions,
a
lot
of
time
is
consumed
in
that
duration.
upon
reading
the
comprehensive
brief
of
the
government,
and
the
learned
and
able
and
my
distinguished
friend
here,
inquiring
in
the
minds
of
the
congressmen
who
have
enacted
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
they've
filled
references
and
quotations
to
the
congressional
record,
rather
inconclusive
of
the
intentions
of
the
congressmen,
reminds
me
of
the
observation
of
the
great
chief
justice
marshall
in
the
case
gibbons
against
ogden
in
which
he
said,
“powerful
and
ingenious
minds
by
course
of
well
digested
but
refined
metaphysical
reason.”
so
entangled
and
the
work,
the
understand
as
to
obscure
the
principles
which
were
before
“complaint”.
an
induced
doubts
where
(inaudible)to
follow
its
own
common
sense
of
course,
not
even
be
perceived.
in
such
a
case,
he
said,
we
should
recur
to
commonsense
fundamental
principles
and
diverse
principles
to
test
their
own,
examine
the
arguments
that
are
to
be
tested.
now
let
us
follow
that
advice.
this
case
is
not
as
difficult
as
my
good
friends
on
the
other
side
would
have
us
believe.
reduced
to
its
simplest
analysis,
it
is
just
this.
nelms
(inaudible)
at
the
foothills
of
north
carolina
in
a
home
which
is
not
a
mansion,
that
is
all
the
home
they
have.
the
federal
government
conducting
training
missions
with
supersonic
planes
from
california
to
north
carolina,
pass
over
his
house
at
a
distance,
i
don't
know
what
the
distance
was,
but
it
was
close
enough
so
the
sonic
booms
generated
to
hit
the
man's
house
like
a
(inaudible).
they
shattered
the
walls,
they
broke
the
windows
and
the
damage
was
so
extensive
that
barely
the
contractor
said,
it
will
cost
more
to
repair
the
house
than
to
rebuild
it.
nelms
seeking
damages
to
rebuild
his
home,
filed
suit
in
a
district
court
in
north
carolina.
that
court
followed
the
theories
of
the
government
and
dismissed
the
complaint.
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
yes
sir,
they
appear
in
affidavits
that
were
filed.
we've
never
had
any
trial
on
that
issue,
in
fact.
nelms
was
a
poor
man,
too
poor
to
afford
a
counsel,
so
in
the
district
court
employed
--
asked
the
local
counsel
to
represent
him.
after
the
decision
was
against
nelms,
he
appealed
to
the
fourth
circuit
at
richmond
in
propria
persona
and
when
the
case
got
there,
chief
judge
hemsworth
asked
the
clerk
of
the
court
to
call
and
asked
if
i
would
represent
nelms
in
that
court
saying
that
he
felt
it
was
a
type
of
case
that
i
would
relate.
of
course,
i
agreed.
they
have
refused,
the
point
we
made,
for
a
court
represent
an
innocent
person.
so
i
walked
down
to
the
clerk's
office,
examined
the
record
and
then
i
found
myself
87
years
old,
semi-retired,
trying
to
get
out
of
it,
in
the
midst
of
the
one
of
the
biggest
questions
of
the
day.
well
of
course,
the
first
thing,
i
did
was
to
look
at
the
federal
tort
claims
act
and
of
course,
i
found
that
it
provides
that
the
government
shall
be
liable
just
as
an
individual
would
be
under
like
circumstances
and
liable
according
to
the
law
of
the
piece
where
the
act
of
omission
took
place.
naturally
then,
i
would
tend
to
see
what
north
carolina
law
was,
and
i
found
that
north
carolina
had
adopted
the
uniform
aeronautics
act
which
provides
a
strict
liability,
that
is
liability
without
negligence.
the
north
carolina
statutes
are
set
out
in
the
appendix
to
our
response
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
and
have
been
put
and
reference
in
our
brief
is
made
to
that
appendix.
then
i
found
another
thing,
that
the
air
force
itself
which
is
home
of
of
the
federal
government,
which
is
the
defendant
in
this
case
had
no
need
of
regulations,
case
resulted
in
the
same
liability
that
the
statutes
of
north
carolina
had
created.
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
sorry.
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
no,
sir,
no
sir.
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
no,
sir
they
are
not.
they
are
set
out
in
the
record
in
this
case,
and
the
regulation
itself
is
mentioned
by
judge
butzner
in
his
opinion.
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
yes
sir.
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
that's
right.
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
that's
right,
that's
what
judge
butzner
had
--
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
that's
right.
now
not
withstanding
the
laws
that
i
have
mentioned,
the
government
claims
that
is
not
liable,
because
of
this
discretionary
function
in
the
statute
and
it
is
our
claim
supported
by
an
abundance
of
authority
cases
cited
in
the
brief
that
neither
the
government
nor
an
agency
of
the
government
has
any
discretion
to
violate
the
positive
law
of
a
state.
it's
outside
of
anyone's
discretion.
i
think
judge
parker,
the
late
john
j.
parker
who
by
the
way
was
really
the
greatest
appellate
judges
that
ever
sat
on
the
appellate
court
in
this
country.
i
know
because
i
already
ran
a
case
before
him.
he
should
have
been
approved
when
he
was
nominated
for
this
court.
but
people
defeated
him.
now
judge
parker,
i
might
be
a
little
bit
inaccurate,
so
i
am
afraid
exactly
what
he
had
in
the
praylou
case.
the
praylou
case
went
up
as
i
recall
from
south
carolina
and
south
carolina
had
adapted
the
same
rule
universal,
uniform
aeronautics
act
of
north
carolina,
and
therefore
the
court
had
referred
in
that
case
the
exact
question
that
we
have
for
before
here,
and
judge
parker
said
or
held
this,
congress
did
not
intend
to
exclude
from
coverage
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act
liability
arising
from
operation
of
government
aircraft
merely
because
under
the
state
law
liability
for
entry
was
made
absolute
and
not
the
dependent
upon
negligence.
nor
did
congress
intend
the
that
there
should
be
a
liability,
in
states
where
a
liability
under
the
state
law
is
based
on
negligence
and
no
liability
in
the
great
majority
of
states
which
have
adapted
a
uniform
aeronautics
act.
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
that's
the
praylou
case
from
the
first
--
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
no
sir,
i
don't
think
that's
this
case.
this
case
arose
in
south
carolina,
of
course
they
applied
the
south
carolina
law.
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
yes,
we
have
a
citation.
it's
in
the
--
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
it's
208
federal
2nd
cited
in
our
brief
on
page
10,
of
our
brief.
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
our
brief
is
a
readmission.
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
now
this
court
refused
certiorari
in
the
praylou
case.
well,
i
know
that
they
say
you
don't
need
anything
to
refuse
certiorari,
but
it
does
mean
something
in
some
cases
because
if
the
decision
in
praylou
on
the
identical
question
was
as
erroneous
and
would
disastrous
to
the
federal
government
as
the
government
claims
now
that
it
would
be
in
the
nelms
case,
i
am
sure,
somewhere
would
have
this
honorable
court
would
assess
it
and
grant
it
certiorari.
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
afterwards.
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
now,
when
the
nelms
case
came
before
the
fourth
circuit,
what
was
that
court
supposed
to
do?
an
identical
question
had
been
raised
and
decided
in
the
praylou
case
and
this
court
had
refused
certiorari.
this
court
had
led
the
decision
stand,
surely
there
was
nothing
for
the
fourth
circuit
to
do
except
to
follow
the
praylou
case,
which
it
did.
this
court
in
what
is
known
as
the
famous
chicken
case,
the
federal
tort
claims
act
was
enacted,
decided
that
government
planes
passing
over
a
farmer's
chicken
farm,
frightened
the
chicken
so
that
they
would
fly
up
against
the
walls
of
the
buildings
and
(inaudible)
and
some
of
the
hens
will
stop
laying
and
those
few
that
continued
to
lay,
their
eggs
were
worthless
for
raising
the
chickens,
no
doubt
because
the
males
were
so
frightened
that
they
couldn't
perform
their
duties
in
fertilizing
days.
now
this
high
court
held
in
that
case
that
according
to
the
fifth
amendment
that
man
was
entitled
to
compensation,
although
not
one
square
foot
of
his
property
was
taken.
they
said
that
it
was
practiclaly
disturbed
for
the
purpose
of
raising
chickens.
now
according
to
the
argument
of
the
government,
nelms
would
have
been
better
off
if
the
federal
tort
claims
act
haven't
been
passed.
he
will
have
some
chance
to
recover
under
the
fifth
amendment.
and
now
i
want
to
have
something
to
say
in
passing
there
for
regulation.
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
i
don't
think
it
can
do
it,
sir.
i
think
an
act
of
congress
can't
affect
--
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
sorry.
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
no,
not
at
all.
i
only
meant
to
say
that
if
we
try
to
recover
on
to
the
tort
claims
act,
we
would
have
been
better
off
to
haven't
given
the
tort
claims
act.
that's
in
the
fifth
amendment,
no
sir.
now
we
will
come
to
that
in
an
another
connection
little
bit
later.
just
a
word
about
these
regulations.
a
federal
statute
authorizes
the
president
of
the
united
states
as
command
in
chief
of
the
army
and
navy,
to
make
regulations
of
the
army,
navy,
and
air
force.
of
course,
he
doesn't
actually
make
them
himself,
he
delegates
that
to
respective
agencies,
in
this
case
the
air
force.
but
when
the
courts
hold
that
they
are
presumed
to
have
been
made
by
the
president
and
they
have
the
force
of
law,
feeling
and
i
might
not
have
time
to
complete
my
brief,
i
have
decided
to
write
a
brief
on
that
issue
before
i
received
the
government's
brief.
we
found
31
cases,
three
from
this
high
court,
holding
that
regulations
of
that
type
have
the
force
of
law.
we
found
one
the
ward
(ph)
case
making
particularly
a
scrap
of
paper
out
of
a
regulation,
the
ward
case
was
a
district
court
case
in
pennsylvania.
so
lo
and
behold,
when
i
got
the
brief
of
the
government,
they
cited
the
ward
case.
we
had
cited
in
our
brief,
because
along
the
cases
we
found
two
of
those
claims
were
made
to
us,
but
we
cited
all
other
cases.
they
cited
the
ward
case.
they
decided
one
above
all
of
these
other
cases,
(inaudible)
that
this
court
had
decided.
perhaps
the
gentlemen
belonging
to
that
school
of
thought
that
the
last
cases
have
any
relevance
or
importance
and
they
stopped
where
the
last
advent
cheat
of
a
larger
system
and
looked
back.
in
the
first
case
they
find
(inaudible).
now
dean
palm
(ph)
told
us
that
you
might
as
well
read
throw
your
whole
law
books
that's
just
been
in
the
shelf
for
30
years,
but
you
didn't
lend
it
back
to
one.
now,
of
course
the
(inaudible)
case,
i
understand,
it
is
before
the
third
circuit
and
that
the
third
circuit
is
awaiting
the
decision
of
this
court
in
this
case
before
it
decides
the
ward
case.
i
want
to
pay
my
respects
to
the
famous
dalehite
case,
of
course
the
lawyers
were
depleted.
i
had
been
the
defendant
against
them
in
that
case.
500
and
some
persons
were
killed
and
millions
of
dollars
worth
of
property
was
destroyed
and
hundreds
of
persons
injured.
now
the
amount
of
the
damage
ought
not
to
have
had
anything
to
do
with
the
decision,
but
apparently
it
did.
but
aside
from
that
in
the
dalehite
case
there
was
no
statute
involved
as
a
guide
to
the
court
and
there
was
no
regulation
involved
as
a
guide
to
the
court.
and
according
to
the
court's
own
reading
the
ultrahazardous
doctrine
didn't
apply,
because
the
court
found
that
the
explosion
was
a
result
of
an
accident,
hear
what
i
am
saying,
absolutely
unforeseeable
by
the
exercise
of
the
(inaudible).
so
nothing
has
been
put
in
--
exercise
of
ordinary
care.
i
don't
think
the
case
has
any
control
over
the
issues
in
this
case
and
that's
was
judge
butzner
said,
judge
butzner
of
the
fourth
circuit,
who
might
approach
this
case
from
another
angle.
we
know
that
the
federal
government
has
no
powers
except
those
granted
in
the
constitution
either
expressed
it
or
by
necessary
implication.
now,
we
have
a
federal
statute
and
a
state
statute
on
the
same
subject.
what
are
we
to
do?
we
are
required
by
the
law
to
examine
both
statutes
and
if
they
are
not
irreconcilably
--
if
they
are
not
wholly
irreconcilable,
then
we
must
-–
what
i
am
saying,
we
must
construe
the
two
statutes
so
as
to
let
them
both
stand
if
we
can,
and
you
have
a
unique
situation
here.
the
federal
statute
actually
creates
for
word
of
action
under
the
state
law,
because
it
says
that
the
federal
government
will
be
liable,
if
any
individual
in
the
state
(inaudible)
and
it
says
further
that
the
liability
must
be
according
to
the
state
law,
then
you
have
the
discretion
that
i
am
referring
to
in
the
federal
statute.
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
that,
when
you
come
to
construe
the
statutes?
remember,
a
lot
of
times,
the
limited
powers
of
the
federal
government
and
the
unlimited
powers
of
the
state
government
except
as
they
are
restricted
by
federal
constitution
and
its
own
constitution
and
by
federal
statute
authorized
by
the
federal
constitution.
you
will
have
to
construe
the
discretionary
function
provision
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act
to
the
effect
that
there
is
no
discretion
on
the
power
of
the
federal
government
or
any
agency
of
the
federal
government
or
any
person
representing
the
federal
government,
no
discretion
to
violate
the
positive
unambiguous
state
law.
then
both
statutes
can
live
together.
now,
that
construction
in
my
own
judgment
would
be
more
in
keeping
with
the
intention
of
the
congress
to
spread
the
liability
over
all
of
the
taxpayers
instead
of
requiring
the
poor
taxpayer
who
sustained
the
loss
to
bear
it
all.
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
i
don't
think
that
the
federal
government
has
any
right
even
for
the
benefit
in
war
times
and
any
other
times
to
destroy
a
property
and
put
the
burden
of
all
damage
on
that
property
only
rather
than
on
all
the
people
through
taxes
letting
all
the
citizens
bear
it.
i
don't
think
they
would
have
a
right
to
do
that.
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
yes
sir,
it
would.
in
many
instance
has
the
government
any
discretion
to
take
property
or
destroy
a
property,
without
claim.
they
are
prohibited
by
the
first
amendment
to
the
constitution.
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
well.
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
that's
right,
it
certainly
is,
but
still
if
they
destroy
the
property
of
a
private
person,
you
have
being
destroy
for
public
purposes,
private
property
being
destroyed
for
public
purposes,
without
compensation.
it's
just
a
question
of
magnitude,
suppose
a
government
tank
runs
over
a
house.
i
will
illustrate
this
again.
when
i
first
came
to
the
bar,
we
have
a
--
the
highway
commission
was
vested
with
absolute
and
uncontrollable
discretion
to
run
highways
to
new...
but
there
was
another
law
which
provided
that
they
could
run
a
highway
through
a
man's
(inaudible).
now
they
couldn't
exercise
that
uncontrollable
discretion
and
violated
that
other
statute.
so
anyway
you
look
at,
you
would
see
rules
of
law
and
your
discretion
can't
be
exercised
in
violation
of
rules
--
positive
rules
and
you
had
the
law
in
dalehite
case
–
you
had
no
rules
of
that
kind,
no
statutes
or
anything
of
that
kind.
you
had
nothing
but
the
ultra
hazardous
act,
and
of
course
that
wasn't
up
further
in
view,
fine
use
of
fact
that
the
court
made.
just
before,
after
i
had
written
our
brief
in
this
case,
a
few
days
before
i
left
home,
i
came
across
my
desk,
two
articles
written
on
the
nelms
case.
one
from
the
new
york
law
review,
from
university
of
new
york
and
other
from
students
in
university
of
washington,
at
seattle.
i
read
those
two
articles
with
a
great
deal
of
interest.
there
we
have
a
younger
generation
taking
a
new
look
at
the
situation
and
i
became
more
convinced
than
ever
of
the
confusion
that
exists
in
this
country
in
reference
to
the
torts
claims
act
and
particularly
the
discretionary
function.
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
well,
i
have
one
of
them,
sir.
i
have
the
new
york.
mr.
george
e.
allen,
sr.
now,
the
one
from
washington
state,
the
only
citation,
i
can
give
there
is
the
name
of
the
two
gentlemen
that
wrote
it.
it
seems
that
they
wrote
the
brief
in
the
court
argument
case.
now
the
federal
--
the
new
york
review,
i
don't
think
it's
out
yet,
but
it
will
be
published
in
the
april
issue
of
the
new
york
university
law
review
and
the
title
of
it
is
federal
torts
claims
act.
the
government
maybe
is
strictly
liable
to
a
homeowner
for
damage
resulting
from
a
sonic
boom
(inaudible).
there
was
a
very
good
discussion
there
and
the
other
case
is
a
brief
written
by
--
i
have
the
name
here
somewhere
--
two
students
(inaudible)
i
have
the
given
them
down
to
the
clerk,
you
can
take
them
down.
now
after
reading
those
articles
as
i
said,
i
was
more
convinced
than
ever
of
the
predicament
we
are
in,
and
the
state
of
confusion
we
are
in
on
this
subject.
and
i
am
going
to
offer
this
solutions
which
is
the
only
one
i
think
of,
that
will
clear
up
in
that,
and
it
would
be
in
harmony,
i
think
with
the
intention
of
the
congress.
that
is
wherever
that
is
a
state
statute
fixing
the
liabilities
or
even
a
regulation
of
the
air
force
which
is
a
part
of
the
government,
then
they
take
this
discretionary
function
provision
out
of
the
area
of
discretion
and
the
government
should
pay
it.
now
neither
the
rules
require
merely
indicate
to
this
honorable
court
what
action
i
think
it
should
take.
what
special
relief
i
believe,
where
the
rule
says,
i
think
the
fourth
circuit
should
be
affirmed
in
its
ruling
on
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
and
the
case
remanded
for
trial
to
court
on
the
question
of
proximate
cause
and
damages,
and
that
as
to
the
fifth
amendment,
the
case
should
be
remanded
with
trial
before
the
court
with
a
jury,
if
we
make
a
submissible
case
on
the
question
of
taking
with
private
property
for
public
purposes
without
compensations,
and
i
thank
you.
