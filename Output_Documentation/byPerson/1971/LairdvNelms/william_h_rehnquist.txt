i
think
that
there
is
a
difference
too,
where
you
are
talking
about
an
intentional
tort,
whether
you
mean,
whether
the
act
intending
to
do
the
particular
act
or
whether
we
did
it
with
some
sort
of
bad
intent
towards
the
recipient
of
the
circuit.

and
was
not
wrongful,
isn't
it?
justice
william

rehnquist
do
you
think
congress
use
the
word
“wrongful”
in
the
act?
to
me,
anything
that
was
a
legal
wrong
under
state
law
or
do
you
think
it
has
some
narrower
definition?
justice
william

mr.
stone,
as
i
read
the
respondent's
brief,
they
contend
that
even
though
they
don't
prevail
on
statutory
grounds,
they
are
entitled
to
remand
on
fifth
amendment
grounds
on
united
states
versus
causby.
i
didn't
notice
the
government
addressing
itself
to
that
issue,
in
the
brief,
but
what's
the
government
position
on
that?
