where

justice
william
j.
brennan,

--what
i
meant
by
that
was
is
that
a
statute
or—
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
since
i
interrupted
you,
may
i
ask
that
the
court
of
appeals
by
law,
turned
this
on
cases
of
--
i
gather
here,
supreme
judicial
court
that
indictments
are
amendable
only
with
respect
to
matters
of
form
and
as
to
matters
of
substance
as
to
minor
details
or
other
sense
of
formalities,
is
that
the
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
does
this
thing
turn
on
whether
this
amendment
was
an
amendment
in
minor
detail
or
in
the
sense
of
formality?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
your
position
is
that
whatever
maybe,
by
statute,
indictments
are
also
amendable
in
the
particular
that
we
have
involved.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
the
appellant
present
the
issue
whether
that
statute
is
constitutional?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
we
have
that
in
the
appendix?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

you
said
i
will
find
it
at

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
fact
did
chief
justice
tauro
knew
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
perhaps
i
misunderstood
you
about
what
you
said,
the
ruling
in
gedzium
is
that
there
must
be
this
determination
that
in
fact
the
person,
whose
name
is
now
to
be
substituted,
is
the
person
that
the
grand
jury
intended
to
indict.
is
that
right?
and
you
said
that
under
gedzium
that
determination
must
be
made
by
the
--
trial
justice
has
to
make
the
amendment.
is
that
correct?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
nothing,
gedzium
did
not
prescribed
any
procedure
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then,
who
assumed
this?
your
case
say
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
an
assumption?
that
is
the
presumption
of
regularity
in
that
respect?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
that
the
grand
jury
intended
to
indict
that
very
person.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
cause?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
irwin
i
suppose
that
the
issue
is
whether
this
particular
individual
is
the
one
whom
the
grand
jury
intended
to
indict,
would
not
the
grand
jury
had
to
have
some
kind
of
evidence
that
the
perpetrator
or
the
murderer
was
a
man
5’7”,
black
hair
or
something
of
that
effect,
so
that
you
could
say
that
yes
obviously
they
did
not
have
his
name,
but
this
is
the
individual
that
satisfies
that
description?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i
have
in
mind
was
that,
how
could
chief
justice
tauro
conclude
that
this
is
the
man
that
the
grand
jury
intended
to
indict?
unless
he
at
least,
had
some
idea
of
what
the
person
looked
like
that
the
grand
jury
had
in
mind.
how
could
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
before
the
grand
jury.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
we
do.
i
thought
the
issue
here
was
whether
chief
justice
tauro
complied
with
what
you
tell
us
as
the
requirement
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
decisions
that
he
must
be
satisfied
that
the
person
whose
name
is
now
to
be
put
on
the
indictment
is
the
person
whom
the
grand
jury
intended
to
indict.
is
that
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
i
do
not
see
on
this
record
how
we
can
know
one
way
or
the
other
what
he
did.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
court
below
did
consider
exhaustion
and
rejected,
did
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

but,
that
was
what
grounds?
