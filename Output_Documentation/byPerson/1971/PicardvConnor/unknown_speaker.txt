on

do

or
--

do
i
understand
mr.

that
your
position
is
that
in

this

never
submitted
this

do

(voice

unknown

mr.
twohig,
is
there
a
transcript
of
that

now,
you
say
they
must
to
go
back
to
the
grand
jury
again
and
do
what?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
go
ahead
under
this
statute
with
the
trial
then?
unknown
speaker
he
is
tried
as
john
doe.
unknown
speaker
if
the
statute
does
not
say
john
doe
and
the
description,
it
says
he
maybe
described
by
a
fictitious
name
or
by
any
other
practicable
description.
unknown
speaker
but
we
are
not
--
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
constitutional
question
not
with
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
mr.
twohig,
did
you
have
any
method
of
reviewing
the
amendment
after
it
was
allowed
of
your
objection
on
the
state
law?
unknown
speaker
but,
i
take
it
you
could
appeal
the
allowance
of
the
amendment
over
your
objection
without
first
going
to
trial,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
do
we
have
the
trial
proceedings,
are
they
towards
--
unknown
speaker
there
is
a
complete
record?
unknown
speaker
well,
were
there
any
witnesses
who
testified
at
the
trial,
who
identified
connor
as
one
of
the
--
unknown
speaker
and,
when
you
get
it,
would
you
say
to
whether
any
of
the
said
they
had
also
identified
it
before
the
grand
jury?
unknown
speaker
well,
whether
this
betty
moore
(ph)
that
was
her
name
changed
her
story.
she
told
one
story,
first
to
the
grand
jury
and
then
she
changed
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
because
of
the
hold
of
(inaudible)
employment.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
we
are
not
concerned
here
with
whether
or
not
the
statutory
or
common
law
of
massachusetts
is
violated
in
this
case.
it
was
determined
by
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
that
it
was
not
and
this
was
in
conformity
with
the
law
massachusetts
and
we
accept
that.
we
are
concerned
with
here
is
only
a
federal
constitution
question
that
alone.
unknown
speaker
where
do
we
find
in
your
brief
that
you
specifically
rested
on
the
federal
constitutional
grounds
of
equal
protection
that
i
think
you
are
pointing?
unknown
speaker
page
21
of
your
brief
or
the
transcript
(voice

unknown
speaker
i
noticed
that
the
supreme
judicial
court
opinion
dealing
with
this
indictment
issue,
does
not
treat,
at
least
in
equal
protection
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
terms
that
is
--
unknown
speaker
in
your
brief,
included
in
the
--
unknown
speaker
mr.
justice
clark's
dissenting
opinion
in
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
seems
to
rely
on
the
state
constitution,
on
the
article
12
of
the
declaration
of
rights
of
the

of
the
commonwealth
of

was
the

moore?
unknown
speaker
did
you
make
a

and
that
when
you
began
asking
her
about

for

objected
and
that
then

was
concluded
i
thought,
i
saw
that
in
the
record.
