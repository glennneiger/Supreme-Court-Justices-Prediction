mr.
james
j.
twohig
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case
involving
a
homicide
that
occurred
in
the
early
morning
hours
of
may
1st
1965.
the
indictment
was
handed
down
by
a
grand
jury
but
that
was
in
session
during
the
entire
summer
of
1965,
and
i
believe
was
even
in
session
during
may
1965
and
throughout
august
1965.
on
august
4th
of
wednesday,
i
believe,
this
particular
indictment
was
handed
down
and
the
indictment
besides
naming
a
man
named
donald
landry,
also
stated
that
another
man
was
involved,
john
doe
and
that
they
had
no
description
of
this
man
and
no
other
man.
and,
that
is
the
way
the
indictment
read
and
i
believe
it
is
stated
in
full
on
page
74
of
the
appendix.
this
information
was
attested
under
oath
by
the
grand
jury
and
signed
by
the
foreman.
on
august
6th,
two
days
after
this
so
called
indictment
of
john
doe,
which
is
not
a
fictitious
name
in
my
belief
under
the
massachusetts
statute,
in
my
belief
that
statute
is
intended
to
indicate
a
man
who
was
known
to
the
police
only
by
a
nickname,
a
part
of
the
name
or
a
fictitious
or
assumed
name.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
not
even
any
name,
your
honor,
i
will
agree
to
that,
but
in
those
cases,
the
statute
provides
that
there
shall
be
a
practicable
description
before
indictment.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
yes
and
in
this
case,
connor
was
five
feet
seven,
had
black
hair
and
was
a
very
slight
built,
but
there
was
no
description
of
any
kind
in
this
indictment.
all
the
grand
jury
did
was
to
indicate
that
it
did
not
know
any
way
of
identifying
the
second
man
involved
in
the
homicide.
now,
on
august
6th,
landry’s
wife
was
moving
from
her
apartment
in
boston
and
some
friends
had
gone
there
to
help
her.
connor
and
his
girlfriend
were
at
that
apartment.
connor
was
arrested
when
the
police
visited
the
apartment
with
another
man
of
about
the
same
description.
this
other
man
had
been
in
jail
on
may
1st,
so
connor
was
held
and
this
was
in
fact
stated
to
connor
by
one
of
the
policeman.
i
have
made
this
statement
in
open
court
and
there
has
never
been
any
denial.
connor
was
then
taken
to
police
head
quarters
in
boston
and
thereafter
on
the
9th
of
august,
the
following
monday
i,
in
response
to
a
telephone
call
on
behalf
of
connor,
went
to
suffolk
superior
court
for
the
purpose
of
representing
connor.
it
was
not
known
at
that
time
when
the
case
was
called
that
i
was
in
the
courtroom,
but
it
was
called
and
i
presented
myself
to
the
court.
i
have
supplied
the
court
with
a
copy
of
that
session.
shortly
after
the
court
recognized
me,
the
assistant
district
attorney
in-charge
of
the
case
and
mr.
irwin
was
not
there.
the
attorney
general’s
offices
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
case
until
it
was
in
the
federal
courts,
but
the
assistant
district
attorney
presented
a
motion
for
an
amendment
to
the
indictment.
the
only
information
of
evidence
or
anything
of
any
kind
that
the
court
ever
had
was
a
bold
statement
by
the
prosecutor.
since
the
indictment
has
been
returned,
we
and
he
did
not
identify
who
he
meant
by
we,
we
have
ascertained
the
name
of
the
defendant,
we
did
not
know
it
at
the
time
of
indictment.
those
statements
were
made
as
to
any
other
means
of
identification.
i
objected
to
this,
although
i
was
taken
by
surprise
and
accepted
to
the
allowance
of
the
amendment
and
went
to
it
in
detail
stating
that
there
was
no
indication
that
connor
was
the
man
intended,
to
be
indicted
by
the
grand
jury
or
indeed
that
they
ever
intended
to
indict
any
specific
person.
and
the
consequently
the
indictment
had
no
application
to
connor
what
so
ever.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
i
have
supplied
one
to
the
court
you
honor.
it
is
not
in
the
appendix,
no
your
honor.
it
is
with
--
the
voluminous
record
of
the
free
trial
proceedings
and
the
evidence
in
the
case.
the
amendment
was
allowed,
now
the
amendment
was
not
sanctioned
by
the
gedzium
case.
the
procedure
in
the
gedzium
case
was
in
accordance
with
what
the
gedzium
case
said
the
statute
intended.
the
procedure
in
the
gedzium
case
was
that
the
amendment
was
not
to
apply,
there
was
not
to
be
any
amendment
that
the
indictment
was
in
effect
secret
and
could
not
be
touched,
and
this
is
in
accordance
with
the
decision
in
commonwealth
versus
maher
(ph)
in
massachusetts
which
i
believe
has
never
been
overruled
and
which
states
that
no
amendment
can
be
made
to
an
indictment
in
an
capitol
case.
the
gedzium
case
said
that
when
the
true
name
of
the
man
accused
in
the
indictment
under
the
name
of
john
doe
is
discovered,
it
can
be
entered
in
the
record
and
there
after
the
defendant
will
be
referred
to
by
that
name
and
that
is
what
the
statute
says,
which
mr.
irwin
has
just
read.
but,
that
presupposes
that
john
doe
is
actually
a
fictitious
name
and
that
no
other
practicable
description
is
necessary
and
i
submit
that
the
statute
does
not
mean
that,
but
even
if
it
did
it
would
be
unconstitutional,
because
it
would
deprive
the
defendant,
not
only
of
equal
protection,
but
also
of
due
process.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
he
can
be
tried
under
the
practicable
description
your
honor
in
the
name
of
john
doe.
but,
there
must
be
under
the
statute
a
practicable
description.
he
must
have
been
indicted
by
some
identification
by
the
grand
jury.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
something
of
that
kind,
or
by
photographs,
or
by
fingerprints,
or
by
some
birthmark.
some
description
of
any
kind
--
mr.
james
j.
twohig
and
in
such
a
case
the
culprit
would
never
been
discovered,
i
suppose,
but
in
this
particular
--
mr.
james
j.
twohig
they
do
not
need
it,
the
witnesses
can
go
before
the
grand
jury,
again
your
honor
and
they
can
identify
the
man
as
the
man
whom
they
failed
to
identify
before.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
yes.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
no,
they
do
not
have
to
go
back
this
time,
because
they
had
previously
identified
him
by
a
practicable
description.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
you
go
ahead
with
the
indictment
as
it
stands,
because
it
cannot
be
amended
on
the
massachusetts
law,
in
my
opinion.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
john
doe
and
the
description.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
yes
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
no.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
on
many
occasions
i
brought
up
the
question
of
the
illegality,
i
claimed
it
was
illegal
and
unconstitutional.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
that
is
it
your
honor,
because
how
you
tried
that
--
mr.
james
j.
twohig
i
have
furnished
a
copy
of
them
to
the
clerk.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
the
complete
record
is
here.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
yes
and
i
am
coming
to
that.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
they
said
they
had
not
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
yes,
she
had
testified
twice
your
honor
before
the
grand
jury
and
this
is
my
impression
that
she
said,
she
gave
different
stories
this
time,
but
at
no
occasion
had
she
identified
connor
although
she
had
known
connor
for
several
years.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
no,
before
that.
no
of
that,
because
of
the
hold-up,
connor
was
not
involved
in
the
hold-up.
connor
was
--
i
believe
in
jail
at
the
time
of
the
holdup
and
release
the
day
of
the
hold
up.
but,
two
days
later
he
became
eligible
to
be
charged
in
the
murder
by
virtue
of
being
at
large.
the
two
witnesses
did
not
identify
connor
before
the
grand
jury
and
that
was
their
testimony
at
the
trial
and
since
one
of
them
admitted
at
the
trial
in
order
to
testify
the
trial
that
she
committed
perjury
on
the
occasions
when
she
testified
before
the
grand
jury,
although
this
grand
jury
was
the
same
one,
still
in
session.
at
the
time
when
connor
was
brought
before
the
court
it
was
impractical
for
the
prosecutor
to
go
back
to
the
grand
jury
with
the
same
two
identifying
witnesses
for
some
reason
and
that
is
a
reason.
and
it
was
on
that
ground
that
i
asked
repeatedly
for
the
grand
jury
minutes,
because
if
there
were
any
evidence
in
that
transcript
that
was
favorable
to
connor,
i
felt
that
i
was
entitled
to
have
it
as
stated
in
brady
(ph)
and
maryland
(ph).
the
identification
must
have
been
favorable
to
connor
if
any
there
were,
and
i
do
not
believe
there
was
any
before
the
grand
jury,
but
there
might
have
been
other
evidence
that
they
gave
relating
to
the
events
of
the
robbery,
two
days
before
the
murder.
and,
relating
to
the
events
that
night
before
the
murder
or
the
homicide
or
whatever
it
was.
there
might
have
been
something
there
which
was
favorable
to
connor
and
i
believe
that
i
was
entitled
to
have
that
and
i
was
denied
that
of
course,
repeatedly
right
up
to
time
and
during
trial.
the
court
then,
having
adopted
the
amendment
on
the
thirteenth,
there
was
another
action
taken
by
the
court,
this
time
without
any
information
whatsoever.
it
was
just
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
clerk.
i
suppose
the
statute
had
been
read
more
carefully
in
the
meantime
by
the
prosecutor.
that
an
entry
should
be
made
in
the
record
in
accordance
with
the
statute
to
the
effect,
that
the
true
name
of
the
man
indicted
was
james
j.
connor
and
in
fact,
the
copy
of
the
amendment
which
was
served
upon
connor,
when
he
was
in
jail
after
appearing
in
the
court
on
the
thirteenth
contained
his
name.
now,
the
indictment
of
course
handed
down
by
the
grand
jury
did
not
contain
his
name.
that
was
not
the
indictment,
which
was
served
upon
in
the
jail.
so,
in
my
view
not
only
the
constitution
of
massachusetts
and
the
constitution
of
united
states
were
violated
by
this
procedure,
but
the
law
itself,
statutory
law
of
massachusetts
was
violated
and
he
was
denied
due
process.
on
the
grounds,
i
suppose
stated
in
gedzium
that
when
a
miscreant
conceals
his
identity
during
the
commission
of
a
crime,
he
has
no
right
to
complain
if
he
is
arrested
on
the
general
warrant.
this
is
of
course,
contrary
to
all
the
previous
traditions
of
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
and
to
the
history,
the
judicial
history
that
preceded
establishment
of
the
commonwealth.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
now,
the
federal
questions
were
also
presented
to
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
and
i
have
reviewed
the
presentation
of
these
questions
in
my
brief.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
page
21
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
my
brief,
yes.
in
the
second
paragraph,
i
said
the
constitutional
and
legal
issues
arising
out
of
the
indictment
and
arrest
were
also
fully
argued
in
connor’s
brief
and
in
the
supreme
judicial
court,
pages
10
to
14
as
to
probably
cause.
the
absolute
limitation
on
material
indictments,
two
indictments
in
serious
cases,
the
nullity
of
the
indictment
as
an
the
indictment
in
blank
and
the
warrant
as
a
general
warrant.
all
involving
the
violation
of
connor’s
rights
under
--
i
will
skip
the
massachusetts
laws,
under
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
i
might
also
say
at
this
time
that
i
believe
that
the
sixth
amendment
was
involved.
these
issues
were
of
course,
also
stated
and
argued
in
the
united
states
district
court
at
length
and
i
have
the
citation
there.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
no,
they
did
not
your
honor,
although
i
raised
the
fourteenth
amendment
at
that
time
and
i
believe,
i
mentioned
the
equal
protection
in
my
brief
couple
of
times.
i
did
not
stress
it
or
emphasize
it,
due
process
was
my
main
reliance,
but
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
its
entirely
was
also
relied
--
mr.
james
j.
twohig
i
believe,
yes.
i
have
supplied
the
copy
of
my
brief
to
the
court,
but
i
have
another
copy
here,
which
i
will
give
to
the
court
and
the
court
could
collect
in
case,
i
did
not
do
that.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
yes,
yes
it
does.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
i
did
not
get
that
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
no,
i
do
not
believe
there
was,
but
i
believe
that
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
was
nevertheless
violated
your
honor.
the
second
court
pointed
out
clearly
to
me,
what
i
had
failed
to
emphasize,
although
i
had
mentioned
it
and
that
and
that
was
that
equal
protection
was
also
involved.
but,
i
do
believe,
nevertheless
that
due
process
also
was
involved
here.
the
procedure
then,
that
was
authorized
in
gedzium
was
thus
expanded
and
elaborated
upon.
in
this
particular
case,
to
include
something
that
had
never
been
applied
to
any
other
defendant
in
massachusetts
and
clearly
in
violations,
his
federal
constitutional
rights.
the
case
then
proceeded
and
i
continued
to
protest
from
time
to
time
about
the
indictment.
i
asked
for
the
grand
jury
minutes
and
in
order
that
i
would
get
some
information,
which
would
enable
me
to
ask
for
an
evidentiary
hearing,
as
to
whether
or
not
the
grand
jury
had
been
intending
to
indict
conner
as
some
other
person.
i
asked
for
the
grand
jury
minutes
also
on
several
other
grounds
to
prepare
my
case
for
inconsistent
statements,
to
prepare
for
cross
examination,
but
i
was
principally
concerned
with
the
question
that
whether
or
not
conner
should
ever
have
been
brought
to
trial,
forced
to
respond
to
a
charge
of
murder
in
first
degree.
that
was
my
objective
in
asking
for
the
grand
jury
minutes
primarily.
i
was
denied
the
grand
jury
minutes.
i
think
i
must
have
asked
for
them
formally
at
least
a
dozen
times.
they
were
kept
from
me
on
pretext
after
pretext.
i
have
stated
these
pretext
in
the
brief
on
page
25.
no
--
and
it
continues
for
several
pages
there
after.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
i
have
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
i
will
your
honor.
may
i
say
your
honor
that
the
one
that
i
have
is
marked
in
pencil
and
i
apologize
for
that
--
mr.
james
j.
twohig
alright.
the
grand
jury
minutes
who
withheld
from
me,
me
at
any
rate,
although
they
were
--
i
think
several
constitutional
grounds
in
which
i
was
entitled
to
them.
and,
this
policy
of
secrecy
and
the
withholding
of
evidence
material
to
the
defense
was
applied
to
the
matter
of
interviewing
the
two
identifying
witnesses.
i
have
never
even
seen
the
identifying
witnesses
up
to
the
time
of
trial,
except
on
one
occasion
when
i
visited
the
court
house
back
in
--
i
believe
the
end
of
august,
1965
when
i
saw
a
girl
in
conference,
the
door
opened
and
inadvertently
i
saw
this
girl
in
conference
with
several
police
officers
and
the
assistant
district
attorney
in
charge
of
the
case,
whom
at
the
trial,
six
or
seven
months
later
i
recognized,
as
a
material
witness.
they
had
her
there
at
that
time.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
betty
moore,
a
very
attractive
young
lady,
tall,
slim,
dark
and
one
that
was
easy
to
recognize
later
on.
this
witness
and
the
other
witness
also
a
striking
young
man,
his
name
was
ronald
haze
(ph)
were
both
withheld
from
any
conversations
with
me
or
with
any
of
the
counsel
for
the
three
called
defendants.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
yes
your
honor,
several
demands.
and
--
mr.
james
j.
twohig
no,
your
honor,
just
before
the
trial.
she
was
presented
to
the
court
and
the
last
hearing
before
the
trial,
i
think.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
no
your
honor.
she
was
not.
she
was
put
on
the
stand
in
open
court.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
before
the
trial.
and,
the
judge
instructed
her
that
she
did
not
have
to
say
anything
if
she
did
not
want
to,
that
she
was
entitled
to
counsel
and
so
on
and
he
asked
her
if
she
wanted
to
say
anything
other
the
name
and
address
and
she
gave
the
name
and
that
was
all
she
would
say,
we
were
never
allowed
to
question
her.
the
attorney,
i
recall
now
--
the
attorney
for
one
of
the
other
defendants
was
given
an
opportunity
to
see
her
in
the
district
attorney’s
office
before
that
and
when
he
started
to
ask
her
questions,
the
prosecutor
intervened
with
the
statements
that
she
did
not
have
to
answer
any
questions
if
she
did
not
want
to
and
that
he
was
not
to
ask
her
anything
about
what
she
said
before
the
grand
jury.
and,
the
conference
exploded
in
an
argument
and
nothing
was
elicited
from
her
there.
we
have
maintained
all
of
us,
four
counsels
that
we
never
had
an
opportunity
to
talk
to
these
witnesses.
we
did
not
consider
that
incident
in
court
an
opportunity
to
discuss
the
case
with
the
witness.
i
believe
that
she
was
advised
not
to
talk
to
us.
the
case
was
replete
with
irregularities.
there
were
answers
to
specifications
of
two
of
the
other
defendants.
my
own
specifications,
i
had
no
quarrel
with
other
than
that
they
were
not
responsive
and
that
i
got
no
answers
to
anything
that
i
tried
to
get
about
the
information
i
considered
material
in
the
grand
jury
minutes.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
yes,
i
do
your
honor,
the
full
and
fair
trial.
it
has
been
the
contention;
one
of
the
minor
contentions
i
believe
of
the
prosecution
offices,
that
we
had
a
jury
trial
and
i
think
that
has
been
intimated
in
the
decisions
that
you
always
have
the
jury
trial
as
final
protection.
but,
we
did
not
have
a
full
and
fair
trial,
your
honor.
and,
i
believe
that,
that
is
fundamental
thing,
which
involves
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
the
protection
that
provides
to
every
defendant.
so,
i
regard
it
as
being
involved
in
the
constitutional
issue,
your
honor.
i
do
not
think
that
in
any
way
the
rights
of
the
defendant
connor
were
respected
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
under
the
fifth,
the
sixth
or
the
fourteenth
amendments.
that
he
was
denied
equal
protection
and
that
he
was
denied
due
process.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case
involving
a
homicide
that
occurred
in
the
early
morning
hours
of
may
1st
1965.
the
indictment
was
handed
down
by
a
grand
jury
but
that
was
in
session
during
the
entire
summer
of
1965,
and
i
believe
was
even
in
session
during
may
1965
and
throughout
august
1965.
on
august
4th
of
wednesday,
i
believe,
this
particular
indictment
was
handed
down
and
the
indictment
besides
naming
a
man
named
donald
landry,
also
stated
that
another
man
was
involved,
john
doe
and
that
they
had
no
description
of
this
man
and
no
other
man.
and,
that
is
the
way
the
indictment
read
and
i
believe
it
is
stated
in
full
on
page
74
of
the
appendix.
this
information
was
attested
under
oath
by
the
grand
jury
and
signed
by
the
foreman.
on
august
6th,
two
days
after
this
so
called
indictment
of
john
doe,
which
is
not
a
fictitious
name
in
my
belief
under
the
massachusetts
statute,
in
my
belief
that
statute
is
intended
to
indicate
a
man
who
was
known
to
the
police
only
by
a
nickname,
a
part
of
the
name
or
a
fictitious
or
assumed
name.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
not
even
any
name,
your
honor,
i
will
agree
to
that,
but
in
those
cases,
the
statute
provides
that
there
shall
be
a
practicable
description
before
indictment.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
yes
and
in
this
case,
connor
was
five
feet
seven,
had
black
hair
and
was
a
very
slight
built,
but
there
was
no
description
of
any
kind
in
this
indictment.
all
the
grand
jury
did
was
to
indicate
that
it
did
not
know
any
way
of
identifying
the
second
man
involved
in
the
homicide.
now,
on
august
6th,
landry’s
wife
was
moving
from
her
apartment
in
boston
and
some
friends
had
gone
there
to
help
her.
connor
and
his
girlfriend
were
at
that
apartment.
connor
was
arrested
when
the
police
visited
the
apartment
with
another
man
of
about
the
same
description.
this
other
man
had
been
in
jail
on
may
1st,
so
connor
was
held
and
this
was
in
fact
stated
to
connor
by
one
of
the
policeman.
i
have
made
this
statement
in
open
court
and
there
has
never
been
any
denial.
connor
was
then
taken
to
police
head
quarters
in
boston
and
thereafter
on
the
9th
of
august,
the
following
monday
i,
in
response
to
a
telephone
call
on
behalf
of
connor,
went
to
suffolk
superior
court
for
the
purpose
of
representing
connor.
it
was
not
known
at
that
time
when
the
case
was
called
that
i
was
in
the
courtroom,
but
it
was
called
and
i
presented
myself
to
the
court.
i
have
supplied
the
court
with
a
copy
of
that
session.
shortly
after
the
court
recognized
me,
the
assistant
district
attorney
in-charge
of
the
case
and
mr.
irwin
was
not
there.
the
attorney
general’s
offices
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
case
until
it
was
in
the
federal
courts,
but
the
assistant
district
attorney
presented
a
motion
for
an
amendment
to
the
indictment.
the
only
information
of
evidence
or
anything
of
any
kind
that
the
court
ever
had
was
a
bold
statement
by
the
prosecutor.
since
the
indictment
has
been
returned,
we
and
he
did
not
identify
who
he
meant
by
we,
we
have
ascertained
the
name
of
the
defendant,
we
did
not
know
it
at
the
time
of
indictment.
those
statements
were
made
as
to
any
other
means
of
identification.
i
objected
to
this,
although
i
was
taken
by
surprise
and
accepted
to
the
allowance
of
the
amendment
and
went
to
it
in
detail
stating
that
there
was
no
indication
that
connor
was
the
man
intended,
to
be
indicted
by
the
grand
jury
or
indeed
that
they
ever
intended
to
indict
any
specific
person.
and
the
consequently
the
indictment
had
no
application
to
connor
what
so
ever.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
i
have
supplied
one
to
the
court
you
honor.
it
is
not
in
the
appendix,
no
your
honor.
it
is
with
--
the
voluminous
record
of
the
free
trial
proceedings
and
the
evidence
in
the
case.
the
amendment
was
allowed,
now
the
amendment
was
not
sanctioned
by
the
gedzium
case.
the
procedure
in
the
gedzium
case
was
in
accordance
with
what
the
gedzium
case
said
the
statute
intended.
the
procedure
in
the
gedzium
case
was
that
the
amendment
was
not
to
apply,
there
was
not
to
be
any
amendment
that
the
indictment
was
in
effect
secret
and
could
not
be
touched,
and
this
is
in
accordance
with
the
decision
in
commonwealth
versus
maher
(ph)
in
massachusetts
which
i
believe
has
never
been
overruled
and
which
states
that
no
amendment
can
be
made
to
an
indictment
in
an
capitol
case.
the
gedzium
case
said
that
when
the
true
name
of
the
man
accused
in
the
indictment
under
the
name
of
john
doe
is
discovered,
it
can
be
entered
in
the
record
and
there
after
the
defendant
will
be
referred
to
by
that
name
and
that
is
what
the
statute
says,
which
mr.
irwin
has
just
read.
but,
that
presupposes
that
john
doe
is
actually
a
fictitious
name
and
that
no
other
practicable
description
is
necessary
and
i
submit
that
the
statute
does
not
mean
that,
but
even
if
it
did
it
would
be
unconstitutional,
because
it
would
deprive
the
defendant,
not
only
of
equal
protection,
but
also
of
due
process.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
he
can
be
tried
under
the
practicable
description
your
honor
in
the
name
of
john
doe.
but,
there
must
be
under
the
statute
a
practicable
description.
he
must
have
been
indicted
by
some
identification
by
the
grand
jury.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
something
of
that
kind,
or
by
photographs,
or
by
fingerprints,
or
by
some
birthmark.
some
description
of
any
kind
--
mr.
james
j.
twohig
and
in
such
a
case
the
culprit
would
never
been
discovered,
i
suppose,
but
in
this
particular
--
mr.
james
j.
twohig
they
do
not
need
it,
the
witnesses
can
go
before
the
grand
jury,
again
your
honor
and
they
can
identify
the
man
as
the
man
whom
they
failed
to
identify
before.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
yes.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
no,
they
do
not
have
to
go
back
this
time,
because
they
had
previously
identified
him
by
a
practicable
description.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
you
go
ahead
with
the
indictment
as
it
stands,
because
it
cannot
be
amended
on
the
massachusetts
law,
in
my
opinion.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
john
doe
and
the
description.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
yes
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
no.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
on
many
occasions
i
brought
up
the
question
of
the
illegality,
i
claimed
it
was
illegal
and
unconstitutional.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
that
is
it
your
honor,
because
how
you
tried
that
--
mr.
james
j.
twohig
i
have
furnished
a
copy
of
them
to
the
clerk.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
the
complete
record
is
here.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
yes
and
i
am
coming
to
that.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
they
said
they
had
not
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
yes,
she
had
testified
twice
your
honor
before
the
grand
jury
and
this
is
my
impression
that
she
said,
she
gave
different
stories
this
time,
but
at
no
occasion
had
she
identified
connor
although
she
had
known
connor
for
several
years.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
no,
before
that.
no
of
that,
because
of
the
hold-up,
connor
was
not
involved
in
the
hold-up.
connor
was
--
i
believe
in
jail
at
the
time
of
the
holdup
and
release
the
day
of
the
hold
up.
but,
two
days
later
he
became
eligible
to
be
charged
in
the
murder
by
virtue
of
being
at
large.
the
two
witnesses
did
not
identify
connor
before
the
grand
jury
and
that
was
their
testimony
at
the
trial
and
since
one
of
them
admitted
at
the
trial
in
order
to
testify
the
trial
that
she
committed
perjury
on
the
occasions
when
she
testified
before
the
grand
jury,
although
this
grand
jury
was
the
same
one,
still
in
session.
at
the
time
when
connor
was
brought
before
the
court
it
was
impractical
for
the
prosecutor
to
go
back
to
the
grand
jury
with
the
same
two
identifying
witnesses
for
some
reason
and
that
is
a
reason.
and
it
was
on
that
ground
that
i
asked
repeatedly
for
the
grand
jury
minutes,
because
if
there
were
any
evidence
in
that
transcript
that
was
favorable
to
connor,
i
felt
that
i
was
entitled
to
have
it
as
stated
in
brady
(ph)
and
maryland
(ph).
the
identification
must
have
been
favorable
to
connor
if
any
there
were,
and
i
do
not
believe
there
was
any
before
the
grand
jury,
but
there
might
have
been
other
evidence
that
they
gave
relating
to
the
events
of
the
robbery,
two
days
before
the
murder.
and,
relating
to
the
events
that
night
before
the
murder
or
the
homicide
or
whatever
it
was.
there
might
have
been
something
there
which
was
favorable
to
connor
and
i
believe
that
i
was
entitled
to
have
that
and
i
was
denied
that
of
course,
repeatedly
right
up
to
time
and
during
trial.
the
court
then,
having
adopted
the
amendment
on
the
thirteenth,
there
was
another
action
taken
by
the
court,
this
time
without
any
information
whatsoever.
it
was
just
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
clerk.
i
suppose
the
statute
had
been
read
more
carefully
in
the
meantime
by
the
prosecutor.
that
an
entry
should
be
made
in
the
record
in
accordance
with
the
statute
to
the
effect,
that
the
true
name
of
the
man
indicted
was
james
j.
connor
and
in
fact,
the
copy
of
the
amendment
which
was
served
upon
connor,
when
he
was
in
jail
after
appearing
in
the
court
on
the
thirteenth
contained
his
name.
now,
the
indictment
of
course
handed
down
by
the
grand
jury
did
not
contain
his
name.
that
was
not
the
indictment,
which
was
served
upon
in
the
jail.
so,
in
my
view
not
only
the
constitution
of
massachusetts
and
the
constitution
of
united
states
were
violated
by
this
procedure,
but
the
law
itself,
statutory
law
of
massachusetts
was
violated
and
he
was
denied
due
process.
on
the
grounds,
i
suppose
stated
in
gedzium
that
when
a
miscreant
conceals
his
identity
during
the
commission
of
a
crime,
he
has
no
right
to
complain
if
he
is
arrested
on
the
general
warrant.
this
is
of
course,
contrary
to
all
the
previous
traditions
of
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
and
to
the
history,
the
judicial
history
that
preceded
establishment
of
the
commonwealth.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
now,
the
federal
questions
were
also
presented
to
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
and
i
have
reviewed
the
presentation
of
these
questions
in
my
brief.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
page
21
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
my
brief,
yes.
in
the
second
paragraph,
i
said
the
constitutional
and
legal
issues
arising
out
of
the
indictment
and
arrest
were
also
fully
argued
in
connor’s
brief
and
in
the
supreme
judicial
court,
pages
10
to
14
as
to
probably
cause.
the
absolute
limitation
on
material
indictments,
two
indictments
in
serious
cases,
the
nullity
of
the
indictment
as
an
the
indictment
in
blank
and
the
warrant
as
a
general
warrant.
all
involving
the
violation
of
connor’s
rights
under
--
i
will
skip
the
massachusetts
laws,
under
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
i
might
also
say
at
this
time
that
i
believe
that
the
sixth
amendment
was
involved.
these
issues
were
of
course,
also
stated
and
argued
in
the
united
states
district
court
at
length
and
i
have
the
citation
there.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
no,
they
did
not
your
honor,
although
i
raised
the
fourteenth
amendment
at
that
time
and
i
believe,
i
mentioned
the
equal
protection
in
my
brief
couple
of
times.
i
did
not
stress
it
or
emphasize
it,
due
process
was
my
main
reliance,
but
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
its
entirely
was
also
relied
--
mr.
james
j.
twohig
i
believe,
yes.
i
have
supplied
the
copy
of
my
brief
to
the
court,
but
i
have
another
copy
here,
which
i
will
give
to
the
court
and
the
court
could
collect
in
case,
i
did
not
do
that.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
yes,
yes
it
does.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
i
did
not
get
that
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
no,
i
do
not
believe
there
was,
but
i
believe
that
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
was
nevertheless
violated
your
honor.
the
second
court
pointed
out
clearly
to
me,
what
i
had
failed
to
emphasize,
although
i
had
mentioned
it
and
that
and
that
was
that
equal
protection
was
also
involved.
but,
i
do
believe,
nevertheless
that
due
process
also
was
involved
here.
the
procedure
then,
that
was
authorized
in
gedzium
was
thus
expanded
and
elaborated
upon.
in
this
particular
case,
to
include
something
that
had
never
been
applied
to
any
other
defendant
in
massachusetts
and
clearly
in
violations,
his
federal
constitutional
rights.
the
case
then
proceeded
and
i
continued
to
protest
from
time
to
time
about
the
indictment.
i
asked
for
the
grand
jury
minutes
and
in
order
that
i
would
get
some
information,
which
would
enable
me
to
ask
for
an
evidentiary
hearing,
as
to
whether
or
not
the
grand
jury
had
been
intending
to
indict
conner
as
some
other
person.
i
asked
for
the
grand
jury
minutes
also
on
several
other
grounds
to
prepare
my
case
for
inconsistent
statements,
to
prepare
for
cross
examination,
but
i
was
principally
concerned
with
the
question
that
whether
or
not
conner
should
ever
have
been
brought
to
trial,
forced
to
respond
to
a
charge
of
murder
in
first
degree.
that
was
my
objective
in
asking
for
the
grand
jury
minutes
primarily.
i
was
denied
the
grand
jury
minutes.
i
think
i
must
have
asked
for
them
formally
at
least
a
dozen
times.
they
were
kept
from
me
on
pretext
after
pretext.
i
have
stated
these
pretext
in
the
brief
on
page
25.
no
--
and
it
continues
for
several
pages
there
after.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
i
have
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
i
will
your
honor.
may
i
say
your
honor
that
the
one
that
i
have
is
marked
in
pencil
and
i
apologize
for
that
--
mr.
james
j.
twohig
alright.
the
grand
jury
minutes
who
withheld
from
me,
me
at
any
rate,
although
they
were
--
i
think
several
constitutional
grounds
in
which
i
was
entitled
to
them.
and,
this
policy
of
secrecy
and
the
withholding
of
evidence
material
to
the
defense
was
applied
to
the
matter
of
interviewing
the
two
identifying
witnesses.
i
have
never
even
seen
the
identifying
witnesses
up
to
the
time
of
trial,
except
on
one
occasion
when
i
visited
the
court
house
back
in
--
i
believe
the
end
of
august,
1965
when
i
saw
a
girl
in
conference,
the
door
opened
and
inadvertently
i
saw
this
girl
in
conference
with
several
police
officers
and
the
assistant
district
attorney
in
charge
of
the
case,
whom
at
the
trial,
six
or
seven
months
later
i
recognized,
as
a
material
witness.
they
had
her
there
at
that
time.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
betty
moore,
a
very
attractive
young
lady,
tall,
slim,
dark
and
one
that
was
easy
to
recognize
later
on.
this
witness
and
the
other
witness
also
a
striking
young
man,
his
name
was
ronald
haze
(ph)
were
both
withheld
from
any
conversations
with
me
or
with
any
of
the
counsel
for
the
three
called
defendants.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
yes
your
honor,
several
demands.
and
--
mr.
james
j.
twohig
no,
your
honor,
just
before
the
trial.
she
was
presented
to
the
court
and
the
last
hearing
before
the
trial,
i
think.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
no
your
honor.
she
was
not.
she
was
put
on
the
stand
in
open
court.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
before
the
trial.
and,
the
judge
instructed
her
that
she
did
not
have
to
say
anything
if
she
did
not
want
to,
that
she
was
entitled
to
counsel
and
so
on
and
he
asked
her
if
she
wanted
to
say
anything
other
the
name
and
address
and
she
gave
the
name
and
that
was
all
she
would
say,
we
were
never
allowed
to
question
her.
the
attorney,
i
recall
now
--
the
attorney
for
one
of
the
other
defendants
was
given
an
opportunity
to
see
her
in
the
district
attorney’s
office
before
that
and
when
he
started
to
ask
her
questions,
the
prosecutor
intervened
with
the
statements
that
she
did
not
have
to
answer
any
questions
if
she
did
not
want
to
and
that
he
was
not
to
ask
her
anything
about
what
she
said
before
the
grand
jury.
and,
the
conference
exploded
in
an
argument
and
nothing
was
elicited
from
her
there.
we
have
maintained
all
of
us,
four
counsels
that
we
never
had
an
opportunity
to
talk
to
these
witnesses.
we
did
not
consider
that
incident
in
court
an
opportunity
to
discuss
the
case
with
the
witness.
i
believe
that
she
was
advised
not
to
talk
to
us.
the
case
was
replete
with
irregularities.
there
were
answers
to
specifications
of
two
of
the
other
defendants.
my
own
specifications,
i
had
no
quarrel
with
other
than
that
they
were
not
responsive
and
that
i
got
no
answers
to
anything
that
i
tried
to
get
about
the
information
i
considered
material
in
the
grand
jury
minutes.
mr.
james
j.
twohig
yes,
i
do
your
honor,
the
full
and
fair
trial.
it
has
been
the
contention;
one
of
the
minor
contentions
i
believe
of
the
prosecution
offices,
that
we
had
a
jury
trial
and
i
think
that
has
been
intimated
in
the
decisions
that
you
always
have
the
jury
trial
as
final
protection.
but,
we
did
not
have
a
full
and
fair
trial,
your
honor.
and,
i
believe
that,
that
is
fundamental
thing,
which
involves
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
the
protection
that
provides
to
every
defendant.
so,
i
regard
it
as
being
involved
in
the
constitutional
issue,
your
honor.
i
do
not
think
that
in
any
way
the
rights
of
the
defendant
connor
were
respected
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
under
the
fifth,
the
sixth
or
the
fourteenth
amendments.
that
he
was
denied
equal
protection
and
that
he
was
denied
due
process.
