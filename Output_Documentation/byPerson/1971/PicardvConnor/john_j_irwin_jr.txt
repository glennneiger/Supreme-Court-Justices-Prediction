mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
respectfully
ask
that
five
minutes
of
the
time
allotted
to
me
for
argument
be
reserved
for
a
rebuttal.
this
case
is
here
on
the
commonwealth’s
petition
for
certiorari.
the
court
of
law
found
that
a
massachusetts
charging
procedure
that
permitted
a
grand
jury
to
indict
with
a
fictitious
name
and
permitted
a
court
thereafter
to
substitute
a
true
name
was
in
fact
violative
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
that
to
me
is
the
overriding
issue,
the
commonwealth
takes
the
position
that
in
addition
to
the
equal
protection
argument,
there
is
also
an
exhaustion
argument,
and
there
is
also
a
question
of
whether
or
not
a
purely
state
procedural
statute
should
be
the
subject
matter
of
the
review
by
way
of
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
but
in
answer
to
your
question
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
say
that
the
overriding
argument
that
we
want
to
make
and
stress
upon
the
court
is
the
equal
protection
argument.
the
suffolk
county
grand
jury
and
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
on
august
4th
1965,
returned
a
first
degree
murder
indictment
charging
two
people.
they
charged,
one
donald
landry,
which
in
fact
was
a
true
name,
and
it
also
charged
that
a
john
doe
was
also
accused,
guilty
of
the
murder
of
one
robert
davis.
the
defendant
or
the
respondent
here,
james
j.
connor,
was
later
on
august
9th
1965
on
a
motion
under
general
laws
chapter
277,
section
19,
filed
by
the
prosecutor
was
named
on
the
court
docket
as
the
true
named
defendant
and
the
john
doe
indictment
was
changed
to
read,
james
j.
connor.
the
defendant
seasonably
objected
to
that
on
the
ground
that
he
had
an
absolute
constitutional
right
to
be
indicted
in
his
own
name.
that
as
far
as
the
record
indicates
was
his
sole
basis
for
objection
at
that
particular
time.
that
motion
was
directed
to
chief
justice
tauro
of
the
massachusetts
superior
court,
who
is
presently
the
chief
justice
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts.
the
chief
justice
was
asked
under
the
provisions
of
general
laws
chapter
277,
section
19
which
reads
as
follows
to
make
the
substitution:
"if
the
name
of
an
accused
person
is
unknown
to
the
grand
jury,
he
may
be
described
by
a
fictitious
name
or
by
any
other
practicable
description,
with
an
allegation
that
his
real
name
is
unknown.
an
indictment
of
the
defendant
by
a
fictitious
or
erroneous
name
shall
not
be
ground
for
abatement;
but
if
at
any
subsequent
stage
of
the
proceedings,
his
true
name
is
discovered,
it
shall
be
entered
on
the
record
and
may
be
used
in
the
subsequent
proceedings,
with
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
he
was
indicted
by
the
name
or
description
mentioned
in
the
indictment."

from
the
commonwealth’s
brief

mr.
john
j.

yes,

laws
chapter
277,

19.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes
it
is,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
well,
we
would
suggest
that
this
case
does
not
necessarily
turn
on
that
issue
in
view
of
this
particular
statute.
i
would
suggest
that
those
particular
decisions
return
by
direct
themselves
to
matters
other
than
the
change
of
name.
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
right,
in
the
fictitious
name
situation
or
an
erroneous
name
situation.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes,
it
does.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes.
yes
they
do.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
no.
they
do
not,
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
court
pursuant
to
a
hearing
that
apparently
at
least
on
the
record
appears
to
have
been
un-transcribed,
justice
tauro
on
presentment
of
this
particular
motion
under
general
laws
chapter
277,
section
19
by
the
prosecutor
on
august
10th
of
1965,
audit
the
following
entry
made
on
the
record.
and
i
am
reading
this
entry
from
the
commonwealth’s
brief
or
the
petitioner’s
brief,
which
is
on
page
14
and
i
quote
“tauro,
cj
having
determined
that
the
true
name
of
john
doe
--
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
on
the
docket
entry,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
yes.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
he
made
this
by
the
district
attorney;
he
made
this
entry
on
the
docket.
and
it
read
as
follows:
“the
court
--
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes
it
is
in
the
appendix
although
i
do
not
have
the
--
i
think
it
is
page
59
mr.
justice
brennan.
it
says
that
“the
court
having
determined
that
the
true
name
of
john
doe
has
been
discovered
to
be
james
j.
connor,
orders
the
name
of
james
j.
connor
to
be
entered
on
the
record.”
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
thereafter,
the
defendant
along
with
others
were
tried
in
the
superior
court
of
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
and
convicted.
they
appealed,
of
course,
their
conviction
to
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
the
commonwealth.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes
i
will
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
they
appealed
their
conviction
to
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
the
commonwealth.
and
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
the
commonwealth
was
again
asked
to
confront
itself
or
decide
the
issue
raised
by
this
particular
statute,
277,
section
19.
the
court
there
reaffirmed
its
prior
decision
in
the
commonwealth
v.
gedzium.
there
the
court
suggested
that
this
alternative
charging
procedure
was
in
fact
a
valid
state
interest,
a
valid
state
procedure
and
was
in
fact
in
conformity
with
all
of
the
constitutional
requirements
placed
upon
procedural
statutes
and
that
the
particular
statute
itself
in
no
way
violated
equal
protections
of
the
law,
because
it
required
the
court
to
stand
between
the
accused
and
the
prosecutor
before
this
particular
change
on
the
indictment
could
be
made.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
below
makes
a
significant
argument
and
puts
significant
stress
on
a
fact
that
this
type
of
statute
would
allow
a
prosecutor
to
arbitrarily
or
for
some
other
unworthy
reason
substitute
the
name
of
a
person
not
otherwise
meant
to
be
inserted.
the
court
in
the
gedzium
case
said,
and
i
think
this
is
significant
with
reference
to
the
equal
protection
argument,
the
court
said
that
the
trial
justice
before
he
allows
a
motion
under
this
statute
must
make
“the
requisite
findings”
and
also,
must
make
an
independent
determination
that
no
defendant
is
injured
by
such
substitution.
we
have
to
assume
then
that
the
massachusetts
court
itself
through
its
construction
of
general
laws
chapter
277,
section
19
has
imposed
upon
the
court
a
burden
of
finding
cause
or
probable
cause
that
the
person,
whose
name
is
ought
to
be
substituted
for
that
of
john
doe,
must
be
in
fact
be
the
one
that
the
grand
jury
intended.
and
that
no
injustice
is
done
to
him
by
such
substitution.
we
respectfully
suggest
that
their
construction
placed
on
that
statute
by
the
massachusetts
court
corrects
any
possible
infirmity
with
reference
to
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
what
he
has
done
in
this
instance
and
here
again
we
have
to
--
the
commonwealth
has
to
make
an
analogy
between
the
grand
jury
function
and
the
function
of
the
court.
the
grand
jury
function
in
massachusetts
is
conducted
of
course
in
secret.
it
is
ex
parte;
the
prosecutor
does
not
of
right
have
the
ability
to
be
present
at
their
deliberations.
they
can
conduct
their
deliberations
without
him
and
traditionally
the
massachusetts
grand
jury
has
the
power
to
call
upon
the
court
to
assist
it
in
the
performance
of
his
duty
and
to
serve
as
its
agent
for
advise
to
the
grand
jury
and
if
need
be
for
protection
of
the
grand
jury.
so,
our
argument
is
that
this
particular
statute,
as
it
has
been
construed,
empowers
the
court
or
the
trial
justice
to
whom
this
motion
is
presented
to
place
himself
in
the
capacity
as
an
agent
for
the
grand
jury.
and
then,
to
conduct
this
hearing
ex
parte
to
hear
whatever
evidence
he
feels
is
required,
under
the
gedzium
case,
to
make
the
requisite
findings.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
that
we
do
not
know
mr.
justice
brennan,
because
the
preceding
was
un-transcribed
and
how
the
chief
justice
reached
the
decision
with
reference
to
this
particular
amendment
has
never
been
litigated.
and,
there
again
getting
back
to
argument
of
exhaustion
as
we
make
reference
to
it
in
our
brief
and
i
intend
into
my
argument,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
particular
issue
could
have
been
litigated
on
the
question
of
exhaustion
in
sending
the
case
back
to
the
state
court.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
no
it
did
not.
if
your
honor
please,
the
language
is
that
they
assumed
that
the
court,
before
allowing
this
motion
as
any
other
motion,
will
find
that
there
is
the
requisite
findings
and
find
“that
there
is
no
injustice
done
to
any
defendant.”
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
the
gedzium,
the
gedzium
case.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
right
and
that
the
court
will
act
with
the
fact
in
mind,
that
a
defendant,
before
his
name
can
be
substituted,
is
entitled
to
a
finding
of
cause.
it
does
not
in
any
way
--
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes
it
is,
mr.
justice
brennan.
we
recognized
of
course,
that
if
a
state
confers
a
benefit,
such
as
massachusetts
does
with
reference
to
indictment
procedure
to
the
extent
that
generally
speaking
everybody
is
indicted
in
their
true
name,
we
recognized
that
once
we
do
confer
that
benefit,
that
we
must
do
it
with
an
even
hand
and
we
must
do
it
equally.
however,
we
do
insist
that
equal
protection
does
not
prevent
differences
in
treatment
provided
that
the
differences
are
not
applied
arbitrarily
and
provided
that
they
do
in
fact
serve
a
valid
state
purpose.
in
this
particular
situation,
we
respectfully
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
massachusetts
system
of
criminal
justice
has
a
very
decided
valid
interest
in
empowering
grand
juries
to
return
indictments
even
in
no
situations
where
they
do
not
know
the
true
name
of
the
person
whom
they
are
accusing.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
a
valid
state
interest
that
a
grand
jury
serve
that
function,
that
it
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
public
that
in
fact
there
was
a
person
maybe
among
others
or
maybe
alone
who
they
know
committed
a
crime
and
that
even
though
they
do
not
have
that
evidence,
they
want
the
public
to
be
aware
that
this
person
in
fact
did
commit
this
crime
even
though
he
is
only
identified
as
john
doe.
so,
that
those
people
who
are
responsible
for
the
investigation
and
the
prosecution
of
crime
will
not
be
in
a
position
to
discontinue
their
efforts
to
locate
and
eventually
prosecute
that
particular
individual.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice
marshall
i
did
not
understand.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes
they
can.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
we
do
not
know.
because
of
course,
in
this
particular
situation
we
assumed
--
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
would
the
indictment
still
be
good?
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
no.
i
would
say
they
could
not.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
because
i
would
say
that
the
appropriate
way
of
describing
any
individual
would
be,
if
it
happened
to
be
a
female,
would
be
a
mary
doe
or
jane
doe,
obviously
making
a
query
that
the
person
was
a
female.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
to
a
certain
extent?
yes
it
does
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
right.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
i
would
concede
that
it
is
possible
that
it
might
be
erroneous.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes
it
would
be
possible.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
well,
i
would
respectfully
suggest
to
the
court
that
traditionally,
the
type
of
evidence
that
is
presented
to
the
grand
jury
is
not
a
matter
for
our
inquiry
and
i
would
say
costello
v.the
united
states.
i
think
the
court
is
well
aware
that
the
grand
jury
is
able
to
receive
heresay
evidence,
is
able
to
receive
virtually
any
type
of
evidence.
and
we
do
not
look
behind
the
sufficiency
of
an
indictment
by
a
way
of
examining
what
evidence
was
necessarily
presented
to
a
grand
jury
for
the
purpose
of
producing
the
indictment.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
no,
i
do
not
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
think
that
your
point
is
well
taken.
i
think
that
it
obviously
it
troubles
me,
but
it
seems
that
the
evidence
that
has
been
presented
to
the
grand
jury
is
something
that
we
just
cannot
necessarily
look
behind
all
of
these
times.
i
think
that
the
court
below
put
great
stress
on
the
fact
that
had
there
been
a
more
adequate
description
of
the
defendant,
such
as
you
just
suggested
that
it
would
have
been
easier
to
the
court
to
find
that
this
was
not
violative
of
the
equal
protection
clause
and
that
the
court
below
would
not
necessarily
have
had
the
misgivings
that
they
did
have
about
this
particular
case.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
well,
again
and
this
is
probably
not
a
very
satisfactory
answer,
i
would
suggest
that
the
record
is
bound
with
reference
to
what
evidence
was
before
chief
justice
tauro
thought
--
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes
it
is.
and
again
as
i
suggest,
this
is
probably
not
a
very
satisfactory
answer,
but
i
would
represent
that
the
law
has
been
explicit
that
where
the
grand
jury
speaks,
we
assume
that
what
the
grand
jury
has
done
is
sufficient.
we
do
not
look
to
the
sufficiency
of
it.
and
therefore
--
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes
it
is
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
well,
this
is
again
the
reason
why
we
suggest
that
the
“exhaustion
of
remedy”
would
have
been
more
appropriate.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
very
point
that
you
make
required
the
court
below
on
the
comity
theory
and
on
the
exhaustion
of
remedies
doctrine
to
remand
this
case
to
the
state
court
for
the
appropriate
procedures,
to
determine
exactly
what
you
have
said.
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
to
take
the
position
in
advancing
an
argument
before
this
court
that
the
judge
in
making
this
determination
is
in
fact
an
agent
of
the
grand
jury.
and
once
he
sets
down
on
paper
that
he
is
satisfied
that
the
true
name
is
that
of
james
j.
connor,
the
respondent,
where
in
an
analogous
situation
where
we
would
be
trying
to
examine
why
a
grand
jury
indicted
him.
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
suggestion
that
you
made
points
out
the
argument
that
we
make
in
our
brief
with
reference
to
the
exhaustion
situation.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes,
very,
very
summarily.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
i
think
it
was
a
suggestion
that
the
controlling
legal
principles
were
before
the
court
and
therefore
that
the
court,
sue
sponte
could
have
raised
the
federal
issue
and
therefore
there
is
no
exhaustion
situation
before
the
court
below.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
exactly.
and
mr.
chief
justice
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
we
of
course,
do
not
agree
at
all
with
that
particular
conclusion
by
that
court.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
is
interesting
to
note
in
the
decision
below
that
the
court
does
not
in
anyway
discuss
the
fact
that
the
court,
the
massachusetts
trial
court,
stands
between
the
prosecutor
and
the
accused
with
reference
to
making
this
substitution.
and
i
think
had
the
court
had
recognized
that,
it
would
in
fact
recognize
that
at
least
part
of
its
equal
protections
objection
would
be
dissipated
and
that
if
there
was
a
further
problem
with
reference
to
it,
the
situation
that
justice
brennan
suggests
would
be
appropriate
to
exhaust
the
matter
in
a
state
court.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes.
mr.
chief
justice
i
would
suggest
that
there
could
be
a
due
process
problem
at
that
particular
point.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes,
but
that
was
only
when
the
respondent
and
his
counsel
were
present.
this
particular
matter
was
initially
heard
by
the
chief
justice
on
the
motion
ex
parte.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
when
he
raised
his
objection
on
his
amendment.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
that
is
right.
and
i
think
it
is
significant
to
point
out
though
that
there
was
again,
this
is
in
connection
with
our
argument
that
the
justice
on
the
277,
19
serves
as
an
agent
for
the
grand
jury.
i
think
it
is
significant
to
point
out
that
there
was
a
prior
hearing
even
though
it
was
ex
parte.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
he
instructs
and
he
impanels
the
grand
jury.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
well,
he
is
to
this
extent
that
the
massachusetts
grand
jury
has
available
to
it.
the
justices
of
the
superior
court,
not
only
for
their
advice
with
reference
to
the
proceedings,
they
are
conducting,
but
also
for
their
assistance,
for
the
court’s
assistance
in
the
event
that
the
grand
jury
needs
them.
so,
i
would
suggest
that
at
least
on
that
analogy
that
they
are
serving
in
this
capacity
as
an
agent
for
the
grand
jury.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
the
appendix
shows
that
there
was
a
hearing
held
on
august
9th
1965,
where
the
prosecutor
presented
this
motion
and
that
apparent
--
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
before
the
arraignment
mr.
justice
marshall.
the
arraignment
was
subject
--
subsequent
to
the
time
of
the
substitution
of
the
name.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
no
there
was
not,
because
the
record
is
bound
with
reference
to
that.
but
the
docket,
the
court
docket
indicates
that
a
motion
was
presented
by
the
prosecutor
to
the
chief
justice
on
august
9th.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
that
is
accurate
to
this
extent
that
at
the
arraignment,
at
the
arraignment
the
defendant
through
his
counsel
raised
an
objection
to
the
substitution
of
his
name.
and
at
that
particular
time
the
court
made
that
appropriate
remark.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
that
is
all.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
that
is
all
that
was
said
at
the
arraignment.
and
i
think
the
chief
justice’s
comment
was
that
this
was
not
an
uncommon
procedure.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
no
it
has
not
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
no,
but
i
would
not
want
the
court
to
conclude
from
that
but
that
is
not
feasible
or
practicable.
i
would
assume
that
it
can
be
and
has
been
done
in
the
past.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes
it
is.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
no
we
do
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
of
that
mr.
chief
justice,
quite.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
that
is
exactly
correct.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
exactly,
exactly.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
never
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
i
would
assume
that
they
are
very
few;
i
do
not
know
exactly
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
do
know
that
a
great
many
states
in
an--in
page
20
of
our
brief
we
make
some
reference
to
it,
but
i
would
assume
that
probably
35
states
use
the
information
procedure,
so
i
would
assume
that
maybe
somewhere
between
14
and
15
have
a
variation
of
--
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
we
do
not
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
i
would
suggest
that
there
could
be,
yes.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
no
i
do
not
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
no,
we
cannot
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes
we
do
mr.
justice
stewart.
in
summary,
then
i
would
just
like
to
conclude
by
stating
that
the
commonwealth
for
the
reasons
that
it
has
asserted
in
its
brief
and
in
its
argument
before
the
court
feels
that
the
court
below
if
it
thought
that
there
was
indeed
an
equal
protection
problem
should
have
under
the
comity
doctrine
and
the
exhaustion
doctrine
refer
the
case
back
to
the
state
court,
so
that
the
state
court
for
the
first
time
would
be
able
to
view
its
statute
with
reference
to
whether
or
not
it
was
a
valid
state
procedure
in
light
of
the
constitutional
claims
made
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
by
way
of
a
rebuttal
i
would
only
reiterate
that
it
is
the
commonwealth’s
position
that
the
constitutional
matter
before
this
court
on
this
hearing
is
whether
or
not
that
the
respondent,
james
j.
connor,
was
deprived
of
any
constitutional
guarantee,
especially
the
equal
protection
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution.
with
respect
to
the
argument
that
was
made
by
the
respondent,
through
his
counsel,
i
respectfully
suggest
that
a
reading
of
the
commonwealth
v.
doherty
case
that
is
cited
in
the
brief,
with
the
dissents
will
indicate
that
the
massachusetts
supreme
court
was
not
presented
with
the
constitutional
argument.
and,
that
the
justices
in
deciding
that
case
were
concerned
solely
with
determining
whether
or
not
hurtado
v.
california
was
still
strong
enough
to
support
the
doctrine
of
jones
v.
robbins
in
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
and
no
other
issue.
and,
getting
back
to
the
position
that
the
commonwealth
takes
in
its
brief,
in
its
argument,
i
would
respectfully
suggest
to
the
court
that
this
particular
vehicle,
general
laws
chapter
277,
section
19
is
strictly
a
procedural
vehicle,
by
which
a
grand
jury
which
has
a
valid
interest
in
seeing
to
it
that
they
are
on
occasion,
john
doe
indictment
retained
has
the
power
to
indict
somebody
and
then,
later
require
a
substitution
on
the
“showing
of
cause.”
it
seems
to
me
that
in
that
situation,
that
if
the
court
wanted
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
had
been
an
equal
protection
violation,
that
the
proper
thing
to
do
would
be
to
remand
the
case
to
the
state
of
court
--
the
appropriate
state
court
for
hearings
consistent
with
those
particular
claims.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
respectfully
ask
that
five
minutes
of
the
time
allotted
to
me
for
argument
be
reserved
for
a
rebuttal.
this
case
is
here
on
the
commonwealth’s
petition
for
certiorari.
the
court
of
law
found
that
a
massachusetts
charging
procedure
that
permitted
a
grand
jury
to
indict
with
a
fictitious
name
and
permitted
a
court
thereafter
to
substitute
a
true
name
was
in
fact
violative
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
that
to
me
is
the
overriding
issue,
the
commonwealth
takes
the
position
that
in
addition
to
the
equal
protection
argument,
there
is
also
an
exhaustion
argument,
and
there
is
also
a
question
of
whether
or
not
a
purely
state
procedural
statute
should
be
the
subject
matter
of
the
review
by
way
of
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
but
in
answer
to
your
question
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
say
that
the
overriding
argument
that
we
want
to
make
and
stress
upon
the
court
is
the
equal
protection
argument.
the
suffolk
county
grand
jury
and
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
on
august
4th
1965,
returned
a
first
degree
murder
indictment
charging
two
people.
they
charged,
one
donald
landry,
which
in
fact
was
a
true
name,
and
it
also
charged
that
a
john
doe
was
also
accused,
guilty
of
the
murder
of
one
robert
davis.
the
defendant
or
the
respondent
here,
james
j.
connor,
was
later
on
august
9th
1965
on
a
motion
under
general
laws
chapter
277,
section
19,
filed
by
the
prosecutor
was
named
on
the
court
docket
as
the
true
named
defendant
and
the
john
doe
indictment
was
changed
to
read,
james
j.
connor.
the
defendant
seasonably
objected
to
that
on
the
ground
that
he
had
an
absolute
constitutional
right
to
be
indicted
in
his
own
name.
that
as
far
as
the
record
indicates
was
his
sole
basis
for
objection
at
that
particular
time.
that
motion
was
directed
to
chief
justice
tauro
of
the
massachusetts
superior
court,
who
is
presently
the
chief
justice
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts.
the
chief
justice
was
asked
under
the
provisions
of
general
laws
chapter
277,
section
19
which
reads
as
follows
to
make
the
substitution:
"if
the
name
of
an
accused
person
is
unknown
to
the
grand
jury,
he
may
be
described
by
a
fictitious
name
or
by
any
other
practicable
description,
with
an
allegation
that
his
real
name
is
unknown.
an
indictment
of
the
defendant
by
a
fictitious
or
erroneous
name
shall
not
be
ground
for
abatement;
but
if
at
any
subsequent
stage
of
the
proceedings,
his
true
name
is
discovered,
it
shall
be
entered
on
the
record
and
may
be
used
in
the
subsequent
proceedings,
with
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
he
was
indicted
by
the
name
or
description
mentioned
in
the
indictment."
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
from
the
commonwealth’s
brief
mr.
justice
brennan,
page
3.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes,
general
laws
chapter
277,
section
19.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes
it
is,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
well,
we
would
suggest
that
this
case
does
not
necessarily
turn
on
that
issue
in
view
of
this
particular
statute.
i
would
suggest
that
those
particular
decisions
return
by
direct
themselves
to
matters
other
than
the
change
of
name.
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
right,
in
the
fictitious
name
situation
or
an
erroneous
name
situation.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes,
it
does.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes.
yes
they
do.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
no.
they
do
not,
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
court
pursuant
to
a
hearing
that
apparently
at
least
on
the
record
appears
to
have
been
un-transcribed,
justice
tauro
on
presentment
of
this
particular
motion
under
general
laws
chapter
277,
section
19
by
the
prosecutor
on
august
10th
of
1965,
audit
the
following
entry
made
on
the
record.
and
i
am
reading
this
entry
from
the
commonwealth’s
brief
or
the
petitioner’s
brief,
which
is
on
page
14
and
i
quote
“tauro,
cj
having
determined
that
the
true
name
of
john
doe
--
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
on
the
docket
entry,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
yes.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
he
made
this
by
the
district
attorney;
he
made
this
entry
on
the
docket.
and
it
read
as
follows:
“the
court
--
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes
it
is
in
the
appendix
although
i
do
not
have
the
--
i
think
it
is
page
59
mr.
justice
brennan.
it
says
that
“the
court
having
determined
that
the
true
name
of
john
doe
has
been
discovered
to
be
james
j.
connor,
orders
the
name
of
james
j.
connor
to
be
entered
on
the
record.”
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
thereafter,
the
defendant
along
with
others
were
tried
in
the
superior
court
of
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
and
convicted.
they
appealed,
of
course,
their
conviction
to
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
the
commonwealth.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes
i
will
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
they
appealed
their
conviction
to
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
the
commonwealth.
and
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
the
commonwealth
was
again
asked
to
confront
itself
or
decide
the
issue
raised
by
this
particular
statute,
277,
section
19.
the
court
there
reaffirmed
its
prior
decision
in
the
commonwealth
v.
gedzium.
there
the
court
suggested
that
this
alternative
charging
procedure
was
in
fact
a
valid
state
interest,
a
valid
state
procedure
and
was
in
fact
in
conformity
with
all
of
the
constitutional
requirements
placed
upon
procedural
statutes
and
that
the
particular
statute
itself
in
no
way
violated
equal
protections
of
the
law,
because
it
required
the
court
to
stand
between
the
accused
and
the
prosecutor
before
this
particular
change
on
the
indictment
could
be
made.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
below
makes
a
significant
argument
and
puts
significant
stress
on
a
fact
that
this
type
of
statute
would
allow
a
prosecutor
to
arbitrarily
or
for
some
other
unworthy
reason
substitute
the
name
of
a
person
not
otherwise
meant
to
be
inserted.
the
court
in
the
gedzium
case
said,
and
i
think
this
is
significant
with
reference
to
the
equal
protection
argument,
the
court
said
that
the
trial
justice
before
he
allows
a
motion
under
this
statute
must
make
“the
requisite
findings”
and
also,
must
make
an
independent
determination
that
no
defendant
is
injured
by
such
substitution.
we
have
to
assume
then
that
the
massachusetts
court
itself
through
its
construction
of
general
laws
chapter
277,
section
19
has
imposed
upon
the
court
a
burden
of
finding
cause
or
probable
cause
that
the
person,
whose
name
is
ought
to
be
substituted
for
that
of
john
doe,
must
be
in
fact
be
the
one
that
the
grand
jury
intended.
and
that
no
injustice
is
done
to
him
by
such
substitution.
we
respectfully
suggest
that
their
construction
placed
on
that
statute
by
the
massachusetts
court
corrects
any
possible
infirmity
with
reference
to
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
what
he
has
done
in
this
instance
and
here
again
we
have
to
--
the
commonwealth
has
to
make
an
analogy
between
the
grand
jury
function
and
the
function
of
the
court.
the
grand
jury
function
in
massachusetts
is
conducted
of
course
in
secret.
it
is
ex
parte;
the
prosecutor
does
not
of
right
have
the
ability
to
be
present
at
their
deliberations.
they
can
conduct
their
deliberations
without
him
and
traditionally
the
massachusetts
grand
jury
has
the
power
to
call
upon
the
court
to
assist
it
in
the
performance
of
his
duty
and
to
serve
as
its
agent
for
advise
to
the
grand
jury
and
if
need
be
for
protection
of
the
grand
jury.
so,
our
argument
is
that
this
particular
statute,
as
it
has
been
construed,
empowers
the
court
or
the
trial
justice
to
whom
this
motion
is
presented
to
place
himself
in
the
capacity
as
an
agent
for
the
grand
jury.
and
then,
to
conduct
this
hearing
ex
parte
to
hear
whatever
evidence
he
feels
is
required,
under
the
gedzium
case,
to
make
the
requisite
findings.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
that
we
do
not
know
mr.
justice
brennan,
because
the
preceding
was
un-transcribed
and
how
the
chief
justice
reached
the
decision
with
reference
to
this
particular
amendment
has
never
been
litigated.
and,
there
again
getting
back
to
argument
of
exhaustion
as
we
make
reference
to
it
in
our
brief
and
i
intend
into
my
argument,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
particular
issue
could
have
been
litigated
on
the
question
of
exhaustion
in
sending
the
case
back
to
the
state
court.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
no
it
did
not.
if
your
honor
please,
the
language
is
that
they
assumed
that
the
court,
before
allowing
this
motion
as
any
other
motion,
will
find
that
there
is
the
requisite
findings
and
find
“that
there
is
no
injustice
done
to
any
defendant.”
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
the
gedzium,
the
gedzium
case.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
right
and
that
the
court
will
act
with
the
fact
in
mind,
that
a
defendant,
before
his
name
can
be
substituted,
is
entitled
to
a
finding
of
cause.
it
does
not
in
any
way
--
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes
it
is,
mr.
justice
brennan.
we
recognized
of
course,
that
if
a
state
confers
a
benefit,
such
as
massachusetts
does
with
reference
to
indictment
procedure
to
the
extent
that
generally
speaking
everybody
is
indicted
in
their
true
name,
we
recognized
that
once
we
do
confer
that
benefit,
that
we
must
do
it
with
an
even
hand
and
we
must
do
it
equally.
however,
we
do
insist
that
equal
protection
does
not
prevent
differences
in
treatment
provided
that
the
differences
are
not
applied
arbitrarily
and
provided
that
they
do
in
fact
serve
a
valid
state
purpose.
in
this
particular
situation,
we
respectfully
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
massachusetts
system
of
criminal
justice
has
a
very
decided
valid
interest
in
empowering
grand
juries
to
return
indictments
even
in
no
situations
where
they
do
not
know
the
true
name
of
the
person
whom
they
are
accusing.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
a
valid
state
interest
that
a
grand
jury
serve
that
function,
that
it
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
public
that
in
fact
there
was
a
person
maybe
among
others
or
maybe
alone
who
they
know
committed
a
crime
and
that
even
though
they
do
not
have
that
evidence,
they
want
the
public
to
be
aware
that
this
person
in
fact
did
commit
this
crime
even
though
he
is
only
identified
as
john
doe.
so,
that
those
people
who
are
responsible
for
the
investigation
and
the
prosecution
of
crime
will
not
be
in
a
position
to
discontinue
their
efforts
to
locate
and
eventually
prosecute
that
particular
individual.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice
marshall
i
did
not
understand.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes
they
can.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
we
do
not
know.
because
of
course,
in
this
particular
situation
we
assumed
--
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
would
the
indictment
still
be
good?
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
no.
i
would
say
they
could
not.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
because
i
would
say
that
the
appropriate
way
of
describing
any
individual
would
be,
if
it
happened
to
be
a
female,
would
be
a
mary
doe
or
jane
doe,
obviously
making
a
query
that
the
person
was
a
female.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
to
a
certain
extent?
yes
it
does
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
right.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
i
would
concede
that
it
is
possible
that
it
might
be
erroneous.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes
it
would
be
possible.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
well,
i
would
respectfully
suggest
to
the
court
that
traditionally,
the
type
of
evidence
that
is
presented
to
the
grand
jury
is
not
a
matter
for
our
inquiry
and
i
would
say
costello
v.the
united
states.
i
think
the
court
is
well
aware
that
the
grand
jury
is
able
to
receive
heresay
evidence,
is
able
to
receive
virtually
any
type
of
evidence.
and
we
do
not
look
behind
the
sufficiency
of
an
indictment
by
a
way
of
examining
what
evidence
was
necessarily
presented
to
a
grand
jury
for
the
purpose
of
producing
the
indictment.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
no,
i
do
not
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
think
that
your
point
is
well
taken.
i
think
that
it
obviously
it
troubles
me,
but
it
seems
that
the
evidence
that
has
been
presented
to
the
grand
jury
is
something
that
we
just
cannot
necessarily
look
behind
all
of
these
times.
i
think
that
the
court
below
put
great
stress
on
the
fact
that
had
there
been
a
more
adequate
description
of
the
defendant,
such
as
you
just
suggested
that
it
would
have
been
easier
to
the
court
to
find
that
this
was
not
violative
of
the
equal
protection
clause
and
that
the
court
below
would
not
necessarily
have
had
the
misgivings
that
they
did
have
about
this
particular
case.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
well,
again
and
this
is
probably
not
a
very
satisfactory
answer,
i
would
suggest
that
the
record
is
bound
with
reference
to
what
evidence
was
before
chief
justice
tauro
thought
--
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes
it
is.
and
again
as
i
suggest,
this
is
probably
not
a
very
satisfactory
answer,
but
i
would
represent
that
the
law
has
been
explicit
that
where
the
grand
jury
speaks,
we
assume
that
what
the
grand
jury
has
done
is
sufficient.
we
do
not
look
to
the
sufficiency
of
it.
and
therefore
--
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes
it
is
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
well,
this
is
again
the
reason
why
we
suggest
that
the
“exhaustion
of
remedy”
would
have
been
more
appropriate.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
very
point
that
you
make
required
the
court
below
on
the
comity
theory
and
on
the
exhaustion
of
remedies
doctrine
to
remand
this
case
to
the
state
court
for
the
appropriate
procedures,
to
determine
exactly
what
you
have
said.
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
to
take
the
position
in
advancing
an
argument
before
this
court
that
the
judge
in
making
this
determination
is
in
fact
an
agent
of
the
grand
jury.
and
once
he
sets
down
on
paper
that
he
is
satisfied
that
the
true
name
is
that
of
james
j.
connor,
the
respondent,
where
in
an
analogous
situation
where
we
would
be
trying
to
examine
why
a
grand
jury
indicted
him.
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
suggestion
that
you
made
points
out
the
argument
that
we
make
in
our
brief
with
reference
to
the
exhaustion
situation.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes,
very,
very
summarily.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
i
think
it
was
a
suggestion
that
the
controlling
legal
principles
were
before
the
court
and
therefore
that
the
court,
sue
sponte
could
have
raised
the
federal
issue
and
therefore
there
is
no
exhaustion
situation
before
the
court
below.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
exactly.
and
mr.
chief
justice
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
we
of
course,
do
not
agree
at
all
with
that
particular
conclusion
by
that
court.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
is
interesting
to
note
in
the
decision
below
that
the
court
does
not
in
anyway
discuss
the
fact
that
the
court,
the
massachusetts
trial
court,
stands
between
the
prosecutor
and
the
accused
with
reference
to
making
this
substitution.
and
i
think
had
the
court
had
recognized
that,
it
would
in
fact
recognize
that
at
least
part
of
its
equal
protections
objection
would
be
dissipated
and
that
if
there
was
a
further
problem
with
reference
to
it,
the
situation
that
justice
brennan
suggests
would
be
appropriate
to
exhaust
the
matter
in
a
state
court.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes.
mr.
chief
justice
i
would
suggest
that
there
could
be
a
due
process
problem
at
that
particular
point.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes,
but
that
was
only
when
the
respondent
and
his
counsel
were
present.
this
particular
matter
was
initially
heard
by
the
chief
justice
on
the
motion
ex
parte.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
when
he
raised
his
objection
on
his
amendment.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
that
is
right.
and
i
think
it
is
significant
to
point
out
though
that
there
was
again,
this
is
in
connection
with
our
argument
that
the
justice
on
the
277,
19
serves
as
an
agent
for
the
grand
jury.
i
think
it
is
significant
to
point
out
that
there
was
a
prior
hearing
even
though
it
was
ex
parte.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
he
instructs
and
he
impanels
the
grand
jury.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
well,
he
is
to
this
extent
that
the
massachusetts
grand
jury
has
available
to
it.
the
justices
of
the
superior
court,
not
only
for
their
advice
with
reference
to
the
proceedings,
they
are
conducting,
but
also
for
their
assistance,
for
the
court’s
assistance
in
the
event
that
the
grand
jury
needs
them.
so,
i
would
suggest
that
at
least
on
that
analogy
that
they
are
serving
in
this
capacity
as
an
agent
for
the
grand
jury.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
the
appendix
shows
that
there
was
a
hearing
held
on
august
9th
1965,
where
the
prosecutor
presented
this
motion
and
that
apparent
--
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
before
the
arraignment
mr.
justice
marshall.
the
arraignment
was
subject
--
subsequent
to
the
time
of
the
substitution
of
the
name.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
no
there
was
not,
because
the
record
is
bound
with
reference
to
that.
but
the
docket,
the
court
docket
indicates
that
a
motion
was
presented
by
the
prosecutor
to
the
chief
justice
on
august
9th.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
that
is
accurate
to
this
extent
that
at
the
arraignment,
at
the
arraignment
the
defendant
through
his
counsel
raised
an
objection
to
the
substitution
of
his
name.
and
at
that
particular
time
the
court
made
that
appropriate
remark.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
that
is
all.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
that
is
all
that
was
said
at
the
arraignment.
and
i
think
the
chief
justice’s
comment
was
that
this
was
not
an
uncommon
procedure.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
no
it
has
not
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
no,
but
i
would
not
want
the
court
to
conclude
from
that
but
that
is
not
feasible
or
practicable.
i
would
assume
that
it
can
be
and
has
been
done
in
the
past.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes
it
is.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
no
we
do
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
of
that
mr.
chief
justice,
quite.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
that
is
exactly
correct.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
exactly,
exactly.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
never
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
i
would
assume
that
they
are
very
few;
i
do
not
know
exactly
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
do
know
that
a
great
many
states
in
an--in
page
20
of
our
brief
we
make
some
reference
to
it,
but
i
would
assume
that
probably
35
states
use
the
information
procedure,
so
i
would
assume
that
maybe
somewhere
between
14
and
15
have
a
variation
of
--
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
we
do
not
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
i
would
suggest
that
there
could
be,
yes.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
no
i
do
not
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
no,
we
cannot
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes
we
do
mr.
justice
stewart.
in
summary,
then
i
would
just
like
to
conclude
by
stating
that
the
commonwealth
for
the
reasons
that
it
has
asserted
in
its
brief
and
in
its
argument
before
the
court
feels
that
the
court
below
if
it
thought
that
there
was
indeed
an
equal
protection
problem
should
have
under
the
comity
doctrine
and
the
exhaustion
doctrine
refer
the
case
back
to
the
state
court,
so
that
the
state
court
for
the
first
time
would
be
able
to
view
its
statute
with
reference
to
whether
or
not
it
was
a
valid
state
procedure
in
light
of
the
constitutional
claims
made
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
by
way
of
a
rebuttal
i
would
only
reiterate
that
it
is
the
commonwealth’s
position
that
the
constitutional
matter
before
this
court
on
this
hearing
is
whether
or
not
that
the
respondent,
james
j.
connor,
was
deprived
of
any
constitutional
guarantee,
especially
the
equal
protection
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution.
with
respect
to
the
argument
that
was
made
by
the
respondent,
through
his
counsel,
i
respectfully
suggest
that
a
reading
of
the
commonwealth
v.
doherty
case
that
is
cited
in
the
brief,
with
the
dissents
will
indicate
that
the
massachusetts
supreme
court
was
not
presented
with
the
constitutional
argument.
and,
that
the
justices
in
deciding
that
case
were
concerned
solely
with
determining
whether
or
not
hurtado
v.
california
was
still
strong
enough
to
support
the
doctrine
of
jones
v.
robbins
in
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
and
no
other
issue.
and,
getting
back
to
the
position
that
the
commonwealth
takes
in
its
brief,
in
its
argument,
i
would
respectfully
suggest
to
the
court
that
this
particular
vehicle,
general
laws
chapter
277,
section
19
is
strictly
a
procedural
vehicle,
by
which
a
grand
jury
which
has
a
valid
interest
in
seeing
to
it
that
they
are
on
occasion,
john
doe
indictment
retained
has
the
power
to
indict
somebody
and
then,
later
require
a
substitution
on
the
“showing
of
cause.”
it
seems
to
me
that
in
that
situation,
that
if
the
court
wanted
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
had
been
an
equal
protection
violation,
that
the
proper
thing
to
do
would
be
to
remand
the
case
to
the
state
of
court
--
the
appropriate
state
court
for
hearings
consistent
with
those
particular
claims.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
