the

chief

warren
e.

as
i
read
the
opinion
of

it
was
an
attitude
that
it
did
not
make
any
difference,
but
the
proceedings
and
procedures
were
in
the
massachusetts
courts
it
was
constitutionally
permissible.
that
is
why
at

i
read,
that

chief

would
you

some

problems
if
it

this
is
a
hypothetical,
if
it
develops,
that
the

this

solely
because
the
district
attorney

came
in
and
said
this
is
our

nothing
more.
chief

do
you

what

you

mr.

about
