justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
facts
are
still
pending
and
that
apparently
is
an
action
for
damages,
i
gather
based
on
breaching
of
the
contract?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
lead
just
mentioned
denied
as
(inaudible)
conjunctively,
if
the
action
still
has
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
pending?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
this
was
dismissed
by
agreement
or
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
harvey,
may
i
ask
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
one
thing,
i
understood
you
say
that,
that
as
part
of
the
agreement,
the
defective
deal.
frick
released
mechanic’s
lien?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
what
i
am
trying
to
get
through
(voice
overlap).
what
is
the
relation
between
that
release
and
the
cognovit
note?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
noticed,
what
you
are
saying
is
that
really,
the
whole
judgment
note
procedure
that
since
they
filed
a
consideration
that
when
they
negotiate
it
has
bearing
on
the
support
the
first
note
that
substitutes
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
but
i
do
not
think
that
they
agreed
to
give
judgment
clause
in
lieu
of
and
subsequently
for
what
previously
have
been
construed
by
mechanic’s
liens?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
gather
this
was
just
the
standard
form
(inaudible)
agreement
–-
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
the
significance
of
that?
that
the
answer
on
cross
petition
has
been
only
counterclaims?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
the
base
on
the
basis
of
this
adjudication;
they
might
have
proceeded
on
the
counterclaims
if
they
chose
to
do?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
that
counterclaim
is
still
pending
in
ohio
or
that
was
supposed
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
happened
to
the
counterclaim
in
the
ohio
court,
it
got
dismissed
or
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
brown?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let
me
on
what
mr.
harvey
has
been
presenting
to
us
(inaudible).
it
does
appear
as
though
this
whole
arrangement
was
at
arm’s
length,
both
lawyers
appearing
for
both
and
with
an
understanding,
certainly
on
the
part
of
the
lawyers
i
would
supposed,
what
the
consequences
were
of
this
confession,
of
this
judgment
note?
can
you
really
suggest
that
it
was
not
a
called
a
waiver,
call
it
what
you
will,
that
there
was
not
a
complete
understanding
on
the
part
of
overmyer
of
what
they
are
getting
into?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
you
are
argued
earlier
that
the
arrangement
affected
by
the
lawyer
was
the
breach
of
his
professional
responsibility
and
yet
your
client
entered
into
this
with
his
eyes
open
for
a
quid
pro
quo,
the
release
of
the
mechanic's
liens
and
all
the
rest
of
it
all,
knowing
that
this
is
precisely
the
way
that
the
security
has
to
be
enforced,
that
it
would
be
enforced?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
was
not
suggest
to
you
that
is
your
client
must
have
known.
that
is
the
form
of
security
that
he
gave
frick
in
substitution
for
what
frick
had
in
the
way
of
the
security
before
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
but
you
are
asking
us
to
say
that
this
procedure,
the
filing
of
this
case
is
in
unconstitutional.
(voice
overlap)
back
sort
of
thing
because
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
is
certainly
not,
now
that
you
put
yourself
with
your
eyes
open,
is
it,
in
that
position,
would
you
not
either
have
waive
to
estoppel
it
or
something
based
on
that
kind
of
fact
situation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
but
that
is
not
this
case
as
i
understand
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
was
the
second
note
that
was
substituted
for
an
earlier
note
that
frick
had
one
form
of
security
and
they
swapped
it
for
this
form
of
security
and
surely
your
client
has
to
know
in
giving
this
form
of
security
of
what
that
man
said?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suggest
he
also
knew
that
if
he
defaulted,
it
meant
that
frick
could
do
exactly
what
it
did
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
facts
are
still
pending
and
that
apparently
is
an
action
for
damages,
i
gather
based
on
breaching
of
the
contract?
