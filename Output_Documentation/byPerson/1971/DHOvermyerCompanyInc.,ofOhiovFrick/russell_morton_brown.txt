mr.
russell
morton
brown
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
brings
up
for
consideration
a
judgment
rendered
in
the
ohio
state
court
on
a
promissory
note
which
contained
a
provision
for
confession
of
judgment.
this
is
the
note,
commonly
known
as
cognovit
note
by
which
the
maker
of
the
note
agrees
that
if
there
is
any
default
in
payment
of
an
installment
or
in
the
principal
of
the
note,
that
he
appoints
any
attorney
in
the
state
to
enter
an
appearance,
waive
notice
and
service
of
process
and
confess
judgment
for
the
amount
demanded.
appointment
of
this
attorney
has
been
made
by
the
holder
of
the
note,
the
adverse
body
to
the
maker
of
the
note.
in
the
case
that
borrower,
it
appears
that
the
party
have
a
contract
whereby
the
respondent,
holder
of
the
note,
wants
to
install
a
cold
storage,
a
refrigerating
plant
in
very
large
warehouse
and
the
original
contract
was
for
some
$230,000.00
for
$223,000.00.
the
payment
of
$94,000.00
was
made
and
a
note
in
the
amount
of
$130,000.00
was
executed
to
cover
the
balance.
this
was
to
be
paid
in
monthly
payments
of
some
16
months
and
it
contained
this
provision
that
we
are
considering
here,
the
cognovit
provision,
that
is
any
attorney
might
be
designated
by
the
holder
of
the
note
to
enter
an
appearance
and
confess
judgment.
now
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
yes,
your
honor,
it
was.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
that
would
be
correct,
yes
sir.
now
after
the
installation
was
completed,
the
equipment
was
put
in
operation.
it
was
to
be
automatically
controlled
to
produce
a
temperature
or
10
degrees
below
zero
and
it
functioned
for
a
little
while
and
then
died
of
heart
failure.
the
warehouse
company
lost
some
ice
cream
and
very
nearly
lost
a
large
quantity
of
turkeys,
but
they
were
salvaged
and
they
called
on
the
supplier
to
remedy
the
defect
and
they
tried,
it
was
unsuccessful
and
they
had
to
maintain
a
staff
of
people
to
watch
the
machinery
and
keep
it
going
and
keep
it
controlled.
and
so
the
purchaser
notified
them
that
he
would
not
make
payment
unless
they
could
put
in
good
order
and
refused
to
go
forward
with
the
scheduled
payments.
and
when
that
happened,
they
proceeded
to
take
judgment,
the
attorney
who
confessed
judgment
for
the
defendant,
the
petitioner
here,
was
completely
unknown
to
the
defendant,
never
communicated
with
the
defendant,
was
obviously
selected
by
the
holder
of
the
note
and
paid
by
the
holder
of
the
note
and
he
simply
entered
an
appearance
and
confessed
judgment
waiving
notice
and
service.
then
under
ohio
procedure,
notice
was
given,
that
there
is
a
judgment
against
you
and
the
defendant
engaged
counsel
in
an
attempt
to
set
it
aside.
they
filed
a
motion
for
new
trial,
filed
a
motion
to
stay
execution
and
a
motion
to
vacate
the
judgment.
setting
forth
that
it
was
ended
without
notice
and
that
they
wanted
a
trial
and
tendered
as
sworn
answer
showing
the
difficulties
with
the
equipment
and
the
problems
that
had
risen
and
also
attached
a
course
action
which
alleged
to
claims
in
excess
of
the
amount
demanded
on
the
note
as
damages
due
to
the
malfunctioning
of
the
equipment.
the
trial
court
declined
to
entertain
the
course
action
and
simply
affirmed
the
judgment
and
refused
to
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
yes,
your
honor.
there
was
some
discussion
as
to
whether
it
should
or
should
not,
but
it
did
not
go
into
the
merits.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
yes.
no
witnesses.
no,
nothing
of
that
kind.
thereafter,
an
appeal
was
taken
to
court
of
appeals
and
the
constitutional
question
was
set
forth.
the
court
of
appeals
simply
said,
this
is
a
matter
of
discretion
and
it
would
not
be
offset.
they
then
asked
the
ohio
supreme
court
to
review
the
matter
on
constitutional
grounds,
federal
and
state
and
the
ohio
supreme
court
on
its
own
motion
dismissed
the
appeal
saying
that
there
is
no
constitutional
question
involved.
we
then
filed
this
petition
for
certiorari
and
the
court
granted
it.
now,
we
say
there
are
three
objections
here
really.
first
and
foremost
and
most
important
is
the
question
of
in
personam
jurisdiction
and
i
have
to
dredge
up
from
our
law
school
days
the
case
of
pennoyer
against
neff
in
which
this
court
very
clearly
set
forth
the
rule
that
unless
there
is
jurisdiction
in
personam
there
can
be
no
judgment
in
personam
and
there
certainly
was
no
jurisdiction
here.
in
the
first
place,
it
has
established
that
in
personam
of
jurisdiction
was
rest
upon
service
of
process
within
the
jurisdiction
or
a
voluntary
appearance
and
submission
to
the
court.
now,
there
is
no
argument
that
service
was
made
in
this
case
because
it
was
expressly
waived,
but
they
rest
the
entire
judgment
on
appearance
by
this
attorney
who
was
unknown
to
the
defendant,
who
was
selected
by
the
advisory
and
paid
by
him
for
the
sole
and
only
purpose
of
coming
into
court
and
confessing
judgment.
it
might
be
different,
if
he
communicated
with
the
defendant
and
said
if
you
got
any
defense,
you
got
any
case,
the
right
thing
you
want
me
to
do.
he
did
not
do
anything.
he
just
confessed
the
judgment
and
that
was
all.
now,
we
take
it
as
a
fundamental
that
a
lawyer
who
owes
an
obligation
to
a
client
to
represent
his
interests,
that
he
cannot
go
in
there
and
throw
his
client
into
the
hands
of
the
other
side
without
even
communicating.
for
example,
i
can
conceive
of
a
situation
where
there
is
note
and
i
am
not
saying
that
happens
in
this
case,
the
note
might
be
signed
by
somebody
other
than
the
person
whose
name
is
on
there
or
it
might
have
been
signed
under
circumstances
that
he
might
validly
object
to.
for
example,
there
might
some
misrepresentation
of
fraud
in
the
inducement
and
inducing
him
to
sign.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
it
possibly
would,
your
honor,
but
in
ohio
you
have
a
judgment
against
you.
you
have
lien
on
all
the
real
estate
and
in
ohio,
the
statute
and
the
case
law
and
we
noted
it
in
our
brief
here
and
the
statute
is
set
forth,
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
person
who
moves
to
set
it
aside,
that
is
upon
the
defendant
and
he
must
show
that
he
has
a
valid
defense.
that
is
what
the
statute
says.
in
other
words,
there
is
a
shifting
of
the
burden
of
proof
from
the
plaintiff
to
the
defendant
to
overcome
this,
whereas
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
the
case
were
tried
in
good
order
and
in
accordance
with
usual
standards,
the
burden
of
proof
would
rest
upon
the
plaintiff
to
make
out
his
case.
in
this
kind
of
situation
he
might
not
be
able
to
make
out
a
case,
but
for
the
promissory
note
with
the
cognovit
provision.
at
any
rate
it
is
clear,
that
this
confession
or
this
appearance
by
this
attorney
should
not
be
permitted
to
stand
and
we
have
referred
in
the
brief
to
canon
6
of
the
american
bar
association
which
we
have
set
out
verbatim
and
which
says,
in
so
many
words
that
an
attorney
owes
the
kind
of
obligation
to
his
client
to
disclose
any
conflict
of
interest,
to
disclose
any
possible
basis
upon
which
the
client
might
object
to
his
representation.
he
owes
single-minded
loyalty
to
his
client
and
the
canon
even
says
that
it
is
unprofessional
for
an
attorney
to
accept
an
obligation
where
he
may
be
obligated
to
carry
water
on
both
shoulders.
it
is
his
duty
to
contend
for
that,
it
is
his
duty
to
contend
for
that
which
duty
to
another
client
requires
him
to
oppose.
clearly
that
happened
in
this
case.
the
lawyer
who
was
engaged
by
the
plaintiff
below,
the
respondent
here
has
only
an
obligation
to
the
advisory
of
his
client.
and
he
goes
into
court
only
for
the
purpose
of
throwing
his
client
to
the
wolves,
not
for
the
purpose
of
representing
him,
but
for
the
purpose
of
betraying
him.
now,
that
is
strong
language,
but
that
is
the
obvious
and
inevitable
construction
that
must
be
placed
upon
his
undertaking.
he
goes
in
there
only
to
confess
judgment
against
his
client
and
i
cannot
get
by
the
fact
that
he
does
so
without
ever
talking
to
his
client.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
in
that
event
your
honor
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
russell
morton
brown
i
would
think
it
would
be
materially
different
on
the
facts
because
the
trustee
under
a
trust
note
is
held
as
i
understand
your
honor
to
represent
both
parties.
he
is
not
a
partisan.
he
can
never
take
action
against
the
maker
of
the
trust
note.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
ordinarily
your
honor,
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
situation
where
the
trustee
is
authorized
to
do
more
than
all
of
the
property
in
trust
and
that
the
request
of
the
debtor
offer
it
for
sale.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
if
that
should
happen,
your
honor
and
assuming
the
fact
as
you
state
them
i
would
say,
mr.
chief
justice
that
he
is
under
an
obligation
certainly
to
give
notice
to
the
debtor
of
what
he
proposes
to
do
and
what
is
being
done
and
give
the
debtor
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
before
his
rights
are
concluded
and
represented
in
the
judgment.
in
that
event,
your
honor,
though
the
trustee
is
really
not
engaging
to
be
attorney
for
one
of
the
parties,
but
presumably
to
represent
both
parties
to
the
trust
transaction.
we
have
that
in
the
district
of
columbia
as
a
general
practice,
as
i
am
sure,
your
honor
is
well
aware
and
the
trustee
commonly
says
that
disinterested
third
party
holding
the
note
for
the
benefit
of
both
parties
and
with
an
obligation
to
advertise
or
give
notice
upon
a
default.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
that
is
almost
always
the
case,
yes
your
honor.
but
his
obligation
has
been
held
by
the
courts
to
run
to
both
parties
to
the
trust
transaction.
at
any
rate,
it
is
our
conclusion
that
because
there
was
no
service
of
process
and
there
was
no
voluntary
appearance
by
an
attorney
in
the
sense
in
which
we
members
of
the
bar
would
like
to
look
upon
attorneys
as
obligated
to
represent
a
client
truthfully
and
honorably
and
fairly,
there
was
no
jurisdiction
in
personam
within
the
meaning
of
decisions
cited
in
our
brief
by
this
court
holding
that
such
jurisdiction
in
personam
is
a
vital
prerequisite
to
a
judgment
in
personam.
now,
point
number
two,
brings
us
to
this
ohio
statute
which
authorizes
this
kind
of
confession
and
it
is
our
position
that
the
ohio
statute
is
unconstitutional
when
it
is
measured
against
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
if
your
honor
please,
mr.
justice
white,
this
contention
of
no
notice
was
raises
when
the
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
if
your
honor
please
i
would
say
the
first
time
that
due
process
language
was
used
was
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
it
was
raised
there
then
again
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
state.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
yes,
your
honor
they
did.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
specifically
treat
of
it,
but
it
was
raised.
they
said
that
the
matter
of
the
proceedings
in
the
trial
court
were
a
matter
of
discretion
in
that
they
would
not
set
aside
the
judgment.
when
it
went
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
ohio,
that
court
sua
sponte
dismissed
the
appeal
saying
there
is
no
constitutional,
no
substantial
constitutional
question
involved.
now,
we
have
referred
to
cases
and
decisions
of
this
court
which
required
the
court
to
give
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
these
are
fundamental
requisites
that
have
been
dealt
with
by
this
court
from
the
beginning
of
the
republic.
the
fifth
amendment
with
the
due
process
clause
as
been
in
the
constitution
from
the
very
beginning
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
clause
is
materially
different.
we
have
cited
the
authorities
in
our
brief
and
we
feel
that
the
court's
decisions
speak
very
well
for
themselves
and
for
the
rule
for
which
we
were
contending.
there
is
one
point
that
i
need
to
make
here
and
that
is
this.
the
waiver
that
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
the
waiver
that
it
is
embodied
in
the
contract.
it
is
a
waiver,
the
right
to
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
and
it
is
a
waiver
before
there
is
any
controversy.
we
feel
at
that
is
a
very,
very
important
and
crucial.
we
make
no
point
of
the
fact
that
a
person
who
served
this
process
can
certainly
waive
it
here.
he
can
waive
any
rights
that
he
has,
but
at
that
point,
he
knows
what
a
controversy
is.
he
knows
what
the
consequences
will
be
and
he
knows
what
he
is
doing.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
i
believe
it
would,
your
honor,
yes
sir.
i
think,
as
i
read
some
of
the
court’s
decisions
that
actual
notice
will
measure
up
to
the
constitutional
provision.
it
need
not
take
any
particular
form.
as
long
as
the
individual
has
a
reasonable
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
come
in
and
present
his
defense
that
is
all
that
is
required,
provided
of
course,
your
honor
that
the
court,
the
trial
court
would
entertain
the
defense
and
of
this,
i
have
serious
doubts
in
ohio
because
the
courts
out
there
are
have
from
the
time
in
memorial
given
effect
to
this
cognovit
provisions
and
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
even
though
the
defendant
had
come
in
here,
the
court
would
hold
him
to
that
confession
of
judgment.
i
am
not
in
the
position
to
say
that
they
would
because
i
am
not
an
ohio
lawyer,
but
that
appears
to
be
the
situation,
your
honor.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
well
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
well,
mr.
justice
marshall
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
mr.
justice
marshall,
it
is
my
opinion
that
unless
a
party
to
litigation
himself
engages
counsel,
that
is
not
his
lawyer,
so
he
only
would
have
one
lawyer.
he
would
certainly
disown
the
lawyer
selected
by
the
other
side.
we
have
set
forth
in
the
brief,
cases
in
which
this
has
happened
in
the
other
courts.
fortunately,
i
must
confess,
very
extensive
research
has
not
disclosed
the
great
volume
of
case
law
in
the
subject
because
lawyers
are
generally
very
careful
not
to
appear
in
a
case
where
there
is
a
conflict
of
interest.
all
of
our
training
is
to
be
faithful
and
the
loyal
to
one
client
to
look
out
to
his
interest.
and
in
the
glasser
case
which
we
have
cited
in
the
brief,
this
court
invalidated
the
conviction
because
counsel
for
the
petitioner
who
is
one
of
several
defendants
also
represented
other
defendants
in
the
case
below
where
there
was
a
possibility
of
conflict.
they
were
on
the
same
side,
but
there
was
a
possibility
of
conflict
in
the
court,
in
very
clear
language
announced
the
doctrine
that
there
must
be
no
conflict
of
interest
in
a
lawyer’s
undertaking
when
he
appears
in
court.
now
that
glasser
case
is
typical
of
many
that
we
have
cited
and
we
have
discussed
at
length.
the
cases
were,
for
example,
in
the
indiana
court
a
proceeding
was
brought
against
a
non-resident
and
appearance
was
entered
by
a
non-resident
employee
of
the
defendant
who
sent
an
answer
to
counsel
for
the
plaintiff
in
the
indiana
and
they
entered
a
confession
of
judgment.
indiana
court
threw
it
out
saying,
public
policy
prohibits
this,
a
matter
of
serious
public
policy
prohibits
a
party
from
representing
both
sides
in
the
litigation
and
the
defendant
in
the
case
cannot
be
represented
by
counsel
for
the
plaintiff.
now,
that
is
exactly
what
happens
in
the
case
at
bar.
there
is
one
more
point
i
would
like
to
touch
upon
briefly
and
that
is
the
waiver
point.
the
other
side
says,
well,
he
waived
his
constitutional
rights.
it
does
not
seems
sensible
to
say,
that
when
you
sign
a
contract,
you
equate
even
the
right
the
performance
of
the
contract
and
that
is
what
this
argument
goes
to.
in
other
words,
you
may
waive
rights
when
you
know
what
those
rights
are.
but
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
the
point
comes
up
this
way
though,
if
you
please
sir.
when
the
defendant
is
sued
on
his
note,
he
has
a
valid
defense
to
the
note.
for
example,
that
there
was
no
performance
by
the
other
side.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
and
he
should
not
be
permitted
to
recover.
now,
under
the
ohio
practice
that
is
under
attack
here,
they
go
in
and
get
a
judgment.
this
judgment
is
subject
to
immediate
execution
and
it
could
result
in
tying
up
the
bank
account;
it
constitutes
a
lien
automatically
under
ohio
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
no
sir.
ohio
law
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
if
the
note
where
in
the
hands
of
the
holder
in
of
course
i
am
inclined
to
think
the
holder
it
could
recover.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
he
would
have
to
proceed
against
the
holder
of
the
--
against
to
payee
of
the
note.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
the
original
holder
for
breach
of
warranty.
however,
in
this
case,
you
honor,
we
do
not
have
that
situation
at
all.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
not
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
no
sir.
at
any
rate
that
the
note
--
action
on
the
note
was
more
quite
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
and
i
do
not
believe,
your
honor
that
it
ever
was
in
any
other
hands.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
yes,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
we
have
referred
here
to
a
wisconsin
case
in
which
they
required
that
any
insurance
company
coming
into
the
state
had
to
waive
the
right
to
remove
a
case
from
a
state
court
to
federal
court.
this
court
passed
on
it
and
says,
we
will
not
stand
for
a
waiver
of
fundamental
rights
and
that
is
the
position.
now,
after
we
came
up
here
with
this
case,
the
state
of
ohio
amended
its
statute
and
we
set
that
forth
on
page
23
of
the
brief.
it
says,
the
note
must
contain
this
language.
one;
by
signing
this
paper
you
give
up
your
right
to
notice
and
court
trial.
if
you
do
not
pay
on
time,
a
court
judgment
may
be
taken
against
you
without
your
prior
knowledge
and
the
powers
of
a
court
then
can
be
used
to
collect
from
you
or
your
employer,
regardless,
of
any
claims
you
may
have
against
the
creditor
whether
for
returned
goods,
for
the
goods,
failure
on
his
part
to
comply
with
the
agreement
or
any
other
course.
now
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
believe
anything
that
strips
him
of
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
before
judgment
is
unconstitutional
under
the
authorities
of
this
case.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor.
it
was
an
attempt
to
stay
the
proceedings
in
ohio.
the
court
refused
to
interfere
with
the
proceedings
in
ohio
and
that
is
all
that
happen.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
i
would
say
no.
there
was
no
hearing
on
the
merits.
there
were
no
witnesses,
there
were
no
testimony
taken.
the
court
simply
declined
the
stay
the
ohio
proceedings
and
very
properly
so
i
am
sure,
your
honor.
i
was
not
a
party
to
that
litigation.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
i
do
not
believe
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
our
issue
is
on
constitutional
law
and
i
would
particularly
ask
the
court
to
have
in
mind
two
cases
which
we
have
cited
in
the
brief.
armstrong
against
manzo
and
griffin
against
griffin,
particularly
the
latter
which
was
decided
by
this
court
in
an
opinion
by
mr.
chief
justice
stone
where
the
shifting
of
the
verdict
is
the
unconstitutional
aspect
of
things.
in
the
new
york
case,
they
imposed
the
burden
to
pay
alimony
without
hearing.
brought
it
down
here
and
filed
suit
on
it
and
it
was
held
by
this
court,
that
the
shifting
of
the
verdict,
the
post
judgment
determination
will
not
measure
up
to
constitutional
standards
of
due
process.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
yes
sir?
mr.
russell
morton
brown
i
think
mr.
chief
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
if
your
honor
please,
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
on
its
face
appears
to
be
the
thrust
of
the
fact.
however,
who
would
know
at
the
time
that
the
debtor
would
be
held
to
pay
for
something
he
never
got.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
now,
that
relates,
mr.
justice
brennan,
to
the
merits
that
should
be
determined
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
exactly!
precisely!
that
is
the
constitutional
issue
and
it
is
our
position
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way
mr.
justice
brennan.
if
it
turned
out
that
they
had
not
installed
the
equipment
at
all
or
material
part
of
it
was
omitted
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
no,
it
is
not
this
case.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
we
knew
what
it
meant,
your
honor,
and
he
had
to
pay
this
obligation,
but
i
submit.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
and
then
it
would
go
into
court
and
try
to
get
a
hearing
on
the
valid
defense
it
had
on
the
merits,
but
it
never
got
that.
it
is
our
position
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
in
manzo
and
in
griffin,
this
court
has
held
that
that
will
not
measure
up
to
constitutional
standard
of
due
process.
now,
let
me
just
say
one
thing
that
mr.
justice
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
russell
morton
brown
no,
he
was
the
father,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
well,
it
was
said
in
that
case
that
he
had
forfeited
his
right
because
he
had
not
kept
in
touch
and
supported
the
charge.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
well,
that
is
right,
but
the
court
said
that
you
cannot
adjudicate
these
rights
without
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
this
was
to
restrain
them
from
going
ahead.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
where
any
action
out
there
in
ohio
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
i
am
not
informed
and
i
would
be
inclined
to
think
that
that
is
immaterial,
your
honor.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
yes,
there
is
not
question
about
that.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
they
were
represented
by
a
counsel,
but
there
is
one
factor
i
would
like
to
emphasize
if
you
please
sir.
and
that
is
that
this
been
as
waiving
in
the
beginning,
before
you
know
what
the
controversy
is
about,
before
you
know
anything
about
it,
it
simply
does
not
conform
to
the
decisions
for
this
court.
now,
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
fact
that,
for
example,
now
as
a
judge
you
will
be
aware
of
course
that
all
this
information
about
the
prior
negotiations
would
not
be
admissible
as
fraud.
these
were
merged
in
the
notes.
that
is
the
contract
on
which
they
sue.
they
can
bring
up
all
this
prior
negotiation,
it
is
merged.
as
a
matter
of
evidentiary
law,
i
would
object
at
the
trial
and
the
court
would
sustain
that
objection,
i
am
sure.
nothing
can
modify
the
agreement
between
the
party
and
that
is
where
we
stand
here
as
you
place
it.
was
this
a
constitutional
agreement?
does
it
measure
up
to
standards
of
due
process?
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
be
heard?
all
that
has
been,
it
simply
says
he
got
consideration,
same
thing
applies
in
the
case
of
the
little
consumers.
they
got
it
something.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
brings
up
for
consideration
a
judgment
rendered
in
the
ohio
state
court
on
a
promissory
note
which
contained
a
provision
for
confession
of
judgment.
this
is
the
note,
commonly
known
as
cognovit
note
by
which
the
maker
of
the
note
agrees
that
if
there
is
any
default
in
payment
of
an
installment
or
in
the
principal
of
the
note,
that
he
appoints
any
attorney
in
the
state
to
enter
an
appearance,
waive
notice
and
service
of
process
and
confess
judgment
for
the
amount
demanded.
appointment
of
this
attorney
has
been
made
by
the
holder
of
the
note,
the
adverse
body
to
the
maker
of
the
note.
in
the
case
that
borrower,
it
appears
that
the
party
have
a
contract
whereby
the
respondent,
holder
of
the
note,
wants
to
install
a
cold
storage,
a
refrigerating
plant
in
very
large
warehouse
and
the
original
contract
was
for
some
$230,000.00
for
$223,000.00.
the
payment
of
$94,000.00
was
made
and
a
note
in
the
amount
of
$130,000.00
was
executed
to
cover
the
balance.
this
was
to
be
paid
in
monthly
payments
of
some
16
months
and
it
contained
this
provision
that
we
are
considering
here,
the
cognovit
provision,
that
is
any
attorney
might
be
designated
by
the
holder
of
the
note
to
enter
an
appearance
and
confess
judgment.
now
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
yes,
your
honor,
it
was.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
that
would
be
correct,
yes
sir.
now
after
the
installation
was
completed,
the
equipment
was
put
in
operation.
it
was
to
be
automatically
controlled
to
produce
a
temperature
or
10
degrees
below
zero
and
it
functioned
for
a
little
while
and
then
died
of
heart
failure.
the
warehouse
company
lost
some
ice
cream
and
very
nearly
lost
a
large
quantity
of
turkeys,
but
they
were
salvaged
and
they
called
on
the
supplier
to
remedy
the
defect
and
they
tried,
it
was
unsuccessful
and
they
had
to
maintain
a
staff
of
people
to
watch
the
machinery
and
keep
it
going
and
keep
it
controlled.
and
so
the
purchaser
notified
them
that
he
would
not
make
payment
unless
they
could
put
in
good
order
and
refused
to
go
forward
with
the
scheduled
payments.
and
when
that
happened,
they
proceeded
to
take
judgment,
the
attorney
who
confessed
judgment
for
the
defendant,
the
petitioner
here,
was
completely
unknown
to
the
defendant,
never
communicated
with
the
defendant,
was
obviously
selected
by
the
holder
of
the
note
and
paid
by
the
holder
of
the
note
and
he
simply
entered
an
appearance
and
confessed
judgment
waiving
notice
and
service.
then
under
ohio
procedure,
notice
was
given,
that
there
is
a
judgment
against
you
and
the
defendant
engaged
counsel
in
an
attempt
to
set
it
aside.
they
filed
a
motion
for
new
trial,
filed
a
motion
to
stay
execution
and
a
motion
to
vacate
the
judgment.
setting
forth
that
it
was
ended
without
notice
and
that
they
wanted
a
trial
and
tendered
as
sworn
answer
showing
the
difficulties
with
the
equipment
and
the
problems
that
had
risen
and
also
attached
a
course
action
which
alleged
to
claims
in
excess
of
the
amount
demanded
on
the
note
as
damages
due
to
the
malfunctioning
of
the
equipment.
the
trial
court
declined
to
entertain
the
course
action
and
simply
affirmed
the
judgment
and
refused
to
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
yes,
your
honor.
there
was
some
discussion
as
to
whether
it
should
or
should
not,
but
it
did
not
go
into
the
merits.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
yes.
no
witnesses.
no,
nothing
of
that
kind.
thereafter,
an
appeal
was
taken
to
court
of
appeals
and
the
constitutional
question
was
set
forth.
the
court
of
appeals
simply
said,
this
is
a
matter
of
discretion
and
it
would
not
be
offset.
they
then
asked
the
ohio
supreme
court
to
review
the
matter
on
constitutional
grounds,
federal
and
state
and
the
ohio
supreme
court
on
its
own
motion
dismissed
the
appeal
saying
that
there
is
no
constitutional
question
involved.
we
then
filed
this
petition
for
certiorari
and
the
court
granted
it.
now,
we
say
there
are
three
objections
here
really.
first
and
foremost
and
most
important
is
the
question
of
in
personam
jurisdiction
and
i
have
to
dredge
up
from
our
law
school
days
the
case
of
pennoyer
against
neff
in
which
this
court
very
clearly
set
forth
the
rule
that
unless
there
is
jurisdiction
in
personam
there
can
be
no
judgment
in
personam
and
there
certainly
was
no
jurisdiction
here.
in
the
first
place,
it
has
established
that
in
personam
of
jurisdiction
was
rest
upon
service
of
process
within
the
jurisdiction
or
a
voluntary
appearance
and
submission
to
the
court.
now,
there
is
no
argument
that
service
was
made
in
this
case
because
it
was
expressly
waived,
but
they
rest
the
entire
judgment
on
appearance
by
this
attorney
who
was
unknown
to
the
defendant,
who
was
selected
by
the
advisory
and
paid
by
him
for
the
sole
and
only
purpose
of
coming
into
court
and
confessing
judgment.
it
might
be
different,
if
he
communicated
with
the
defendant
and
said
if
you
got
any
defense,
you
got
any
case,
the
right
thing
you
want
me
to
do.
he
did
not
do
anything.
he
just
confessed
the
judgment
and
that
was
all.
now,
we
take
it
as
a
fundamental
that
a
lawyer
who
owes
an
obligation
to
a
client
to
represent
his
interests,
that
he
cannot
go
in
there
and
throw
his
client
into
the
hands
of
the
other
side
without
even
communicating.
for
example,
i
can
conceive
of
a
situation
where
there
is
note
and
i
am
not
saying
that
happens
in
this
case,
the
note
might
be
signed
by
somebody
other
than
the
person
whose
name
is
on
there
or
it
might
have
been
signed
under
circumstances
that
he
might
validly
object
to.
for
example,
there
might
some
misrepresentation
of
fraud
in
the
inducement
and
inducing
him
to
sign.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
it
possibly
would,
your
honor,
but
in
ohio
you
have
a
judgment
against
you.
you
have
lien
on
all
the
real
estate
and
in
ohio,
the
statute
and
the
case
law
and
we
noted
it
in
our
brief
here
and
the
statute
is
set
forth,
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
person
who
moves
to
set
it
aside,
that
is
upon
the
defendant
and
he
must
show
that
he
has
a
valid
defense.
that
is
what
the
statute
says.
in
other
words,
there
is
a
shifting
of
the
burden
of
proof
from
the
plaintiff
to
the
defendant
to
overcome
this,
whereas
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
the
case
were
tried
in
good
order
and
in
accordance
with
usual
standards,
the
burden
of
proof
would
rest
upon
the
plaintiff
to
make
out
his
case.
in
this
kind
of
situation
he
might
not
be
able
to
make
out
a
case,
but
for
the
promissory
note
with
the
cognovit
provision.
at
any
rate
it
is
clear,
that
this
confession
or
this
appearance
by
this
attorney
should
not
be
permitted
to
stand
and
we
have
referred
in
the
brief
to
canon
6
of
the
american
bar
association
which
we
have
set
out
verbatim
and
which
says,
in
so
many
words
that
an
attorney
owes
the
kind
of
obligation
to
his
client
to
disclose
any
conflict
of
interest,
to
disclose
any
possible
basis
upon
which
the
client
might
object
to
his
representation.
he
owes
single-minded
loyalty
to
his
client
and
the
canon
even
says
that
it
is
unprofessional
for
an
attorney
to
accept
an
obligation
where
he
may
be
obligated
to
carry
water
on
both
shoulders.
it
is
his
duty
to
contend
for
that,
it
is
his
duty
to
contend
for
that
which
duty
to
another
client
requires
him
to
oppose.
clearly
that
happened
in
this
case.
the
lawyer
who
was
engaged
by
the
plaintiff
below,
the
respondent
here
has
only
an
obligation
to
the
advisory
of
his
client.
and
he
goes
into
court
only
for
the
purpose
of
throwing
his
client
to
the
wolves,
not
for
the
purpose
of
representing
him,
but
for
the
purpose
of
betraying
him.
now,
that
is
strong
language,
but
that
is
the
obvious
and
inevitable
construction
that
must
be
placed
upon
his
undertaking.
he
goes
in
there
only
to
confess
judgment
against
his
client
and
i
cannot
get
by
the
fact
that
he
does
so
without
ever
talking
to
his
client.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
in
that
event
your
honor
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
russell
morton
brown
i
would
think
it
would
be
materially
different
on
the
facts
because
the
trustee
under
a
trust
note
is
held
as
i
understand
your
honor
to
represent
both
parties.
he
is
not
a
partisan.
he
can
never
take
action
against
the
maker
of
the
trust
note.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
ordinarily
your
honor,
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
situation
where
the
trustee
is
authorized
to
do
more
than
all
of
the
property
in
trust
and
that
the
request
of
the
debtor
offer
it
for
sale.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
if
that
should
happen,
your
honor
and
assuming
the
fact
as
you
state
them
i
would
say,
mr.
chief
justice
that
he
is
under
an
obligation
certainly
to
give
notice
to
the
debtor
of
what
he
proposes
to
do
and
what
is
being
done
and
give
the
debtor
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
before
his
rights
are
concluded
and
represented
in
the
judgment.
in
that
event,
your
honor,
though
the
trustee
is
really
not
engaging
to
be
attorney
for
one
of
the
parties,
but
presumably
to
represent
both
parties
to
the
trust
transaction.
we
have
that
in
the
district
of
columbia
as
a
general
practice,
as
i
am
sure,
your
honor
is
well
aware
and
the
trustee
commonly
says
that
disinterested
third
party
holding
the
note
for
the
benefit
of
both
parties
and
with
an
obligation
to
advertise
or
give
notice
upon
a
default.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
that
is
almost
always
the
case,
yes
your
honor.
but
his
obligation
has
been
held
by
the
courts
to
run
to
both
parties
to
the
trust
transaction.
at
any
rate,
it
is
our
conclusion
that
because
there
was
no
service
of
process
and
there
was
no
voluntary
appearance
by
an
attorney
in
the
sense
in
which
we
members
of
the
bar
would
like
to
look
upon
attorneys
as
obligated
to
represent
a
client
truthfully
and
honorably
and
fairly,
there
was
no
jurisdiction
in
personam
within
the
meaning
of
decisions
cited
in
our
brief
by
this
court
holding
that
such
jurisdiction
in
personam
is
a
vital
prerequisite
to
a
judgment
in
personam.
now,
point
number
two,
brings
us
to
this
ohio
statute
which
authorizes
this
kind
of
confession
and
it
is
our
position
that
the
ohio
statute
is
unconstitutional
when
it
is
measured
against
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
if
your
honor
please,
mr.
justice
white,
this
contention
of
no
notice
was
raises
when
the
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
if
your
honor
please
i
would
say
the
first
time
that
due
process
language
was
used
was
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
it
was
raised
there
then
again
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
state.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
yes,
your
honor
they
did.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
specifically
treat
of
it,
but
it
was
raised.
they
said
that
the
matter
of
the
proceedings
in
the
trial
court
were
a
matter
of
discretion
in
that
they
would
not
set
aside
the
judgment.
when
it
went
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
ohio,
that
court
sua
sponte
dismissed
the
appeal
saying
there
is
no
constitutional,
no
substantial
constitutional
question
involved.
now,
we
have
referred
to
cases
and
decisions
of
this
court
which
required
the
court
to
give
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
these
are
fundamental
requisites
that
have
been
dealt
with
by
this
court
from
the
beginning
of
the
republic.
the
fifth
amendment
with
the
due
process
clause
as
been
in
the
constitution
from
the
very
beginning
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
clause
is
materially
different.
we
have
cited
the
authorities
in
our
brief
and
we
feel
that
the
court's
decisions
speak
very
well
for
themselves
and
for
the
rule
for
which
we
were
contending.
there
is
one
point
that
i
need
to
make
here
and
that
is
this.
the
waiver
that
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
the
waiver
that
it
is
embodied
in
the
contract.
it
is
a
waiver,
the
right
to
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
and
it
is
a
waiver
before
there
is
any
controversy.
we
feel
at
that
is
a
very,
very
important
and
crucial.
we
make
no
point
of
the
fact
that
a
person
who
served
this
process
can
certainly
waive
it
here.
he
can
waive
any
rights
that
he
has,
but
at
that
point,
he
knows
what
a
controversy
is.
he
knows
what
the
consequences
will
be
and
he
knows
what
he
is
doing.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
i
believe
it
would,
your
honor,
yes
sir.
i
think,
as
i
read
some
of
the
court’s
decisions
that
actual
notice
will
measure
up
to
the
constitutional
provision.
it
need
not
take
any
particular
form.
as
long
as
the
individual
has
a
reasonable
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
come
in
and
present
his
defense
that
is
all
that
is
required,
provided
of
course,
your
honor
that
the
court,
the
trial
court
would
entertain
the
defense
and
of
this,
i
have
serious
doubts
in
ohio
because
the
courts
out
there
are
have
from
the
time
in
memorial
given
effect
to
this
cognovit
provisions
and
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
even
though
the
defendant
had
come
in
here,
the
court
would
hold
him
to
that
confession
of
judgment.
i
am
not
in
the
position
to
say
that
they
would
because
i
am
not
an
ohio
lawyer,
but
that
appears
to
be
the
situation,
your
honor.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
well
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
well,
mr.
justice
marshall
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
mr.
justice
marshall,
it
is
my
opinion
that
unless
a
party
to
litigation
himself
engages
counsel,
that
is
not
his
lawyer,
so
he
only
would
have
one
lawyer.
he
would
certainly
disown
the
lawyer
selected
by
the
other
side.
we
have
set
forth
in
the
brief,
cases
in
which
this
has
happened
in
the
other
courts.
fortunately,
i
must
confess,
very
extensive
research
has
not
disclosed
the
great
volume
of
case
law
in
the
subject
because
lawyers
are
generally
very
careful
not
to
appear
in
a
case
where
there
is
a
conflict
of
interest.
all
of
our
training
is
to
be
faithful
and
the
loyal
to
one
client
to
look
out
to
his
interest.
and
in
the
glasser
case
which
we
have
cited
in
the
brief,
this
court
invalidated
the
conviction
because
counsel
for
the
petitioner
who
is
one
of
several
defendants
also
represented
other
defendants
in
the
case
below
where
there
was
a
possibility
of
conflict.
they
were
on
the
same
side,
but
there
was
a
possibility
of
conflict
in
the
court,
in
very
clear
language
announced
the
doctrine
that
there
must
be
no
conflict
of
interest
in
a
lawyer’s
undertaking
when
he
appears
in
court.
now
that
glasser
case
is
typical
of
many
that
we
have
cited
and
we
have
discussed
at
length.
the
cases
were,
for
example,
in
the
indiana
court
a
proceeding
was
brought
against
a
non-resident
and
appearance
was
entered
by
a
non-resident
employee
of
the
defendant
who
sent
an
answer
to
counsel
for
the
plaintiff
in
the
indiana
and
they
entered
a
confession
of
judgment.
indiana
court
threw
it
out
saying,
public
policy
prohibits
this,
a
matter
of
serious
public
policy
prohibits
a
party
from
representing
both
sides
in
the
litigation
and
the
defendant
in
the
case
cannot
be
represented
by
counsel
for
the
plaintiff.
now,
that
is
exactly
what
happens
in
the
case
at
bar.
there
is
one
more
point
i
would
like
to
touch
upon
briefly
and
that
is
the
waiver
point.
the
other
side
says,
well,
he
waived
his
constitutional
rights.
it
does
not
seems
sensible
to
say,
that
when
you
sign
a
contract,
you
equate
even
the
right
the
performance
of
the
contract
and
that
is
what
this
argument
goes
to.
in
other
words,
you
may
waive
rights
when
you
know
what
those
rights
are.
but
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
the
point
comes
up
this
way
though,
if
you
please
sir.
when
the
defendant
is
sued
on
his
note,
he
has
a
valid
defense
to
the
note.
for
example,
that
there
was
no
performance
by
the
other
side.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
and
he
should
not
be
permitted
to
recover.
now,
under
the
ohio
practice
that
is
under
attack
here,
they
go
in
and
get
a
judgment.
this
judgment
is
subject
to
immediate
execution
and
it
could
result
in
tying
up
the
bank
account;
it
constitutes
a
lien
automatically
under
ohio
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
no
sir.
ohio
law
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
if
the
note
where
in
the
hands
of
the
holder
in
of
course
i
am
inclined
to
think
the
holder
it
could
recover.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
he
would
have
to
proceed
against
the
holder
of
the
--
against
to
payee
of
the
note.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
the
original
holder
for
breach
of
warranty.
however,
in
this
case,
you
honor,
we
do
not
have
that
situation
at
all.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
not
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
no
sir.
at
any
rate
that
the
note
--
action
on
the
note
was
more
quite
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
and
i
do
not
believe,
your
honor
that
it
ever
was
in
any
other
hands.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
yes,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
we
have
referred
here
to
a
wisconsin
case
in
which
they
required
that
any
insurance
company
coming
into
the
state
had
to
waive
the
right
to
remove
a
case
from
a
state
court
to
federal
court.
this
court
passed
on
it
and
says,
we
will
not
stand
for
a
waiver
of
fundamental
rights
and
that
is
the
position.
now,
after
we
came
up
here
with
this
case,
the
state
of
ohio
amended
its
statute
and
we
set
that
forth
on
page
23
of
the
brief.
it
says,
the
note
must
contain
this
language.
one;
by
signing
this
paper
you
give
up
your
right
to
notice
and
court
trial.
if
you
do
not
pay
on
time,
a
court
judgment
may
be
taken
against
you
without
your
prior
knowledge
and
the
powers
of
a
court
then
can
be
used
to
collect
from
you
or
your
employer,
regardless,
of
any
claims
you
may
have
against
the
creditor
whether
for
returned
goods,
for
the
goods,
failure
on
his
part
to
comply
with
the
agreement
or
any
other
course.
now
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
believe
anything
that
strips
him
of
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
before
judgment
is
unconstitutional
under
the
authorities
of
this
case.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor.
it
was
an
attempt
to
stay
the
proceedings
in
ohio.
the
court
refused
to
interfere
with
the
proceedings
in
ohio
and
that
is
all
that
happen.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
i
would
say
no.
there
was
no
hearing
on
the
merits.
there
were
no
witnesses,
there
were
no
testimony
taken.
the
court
simply
declined
the
stay
the
ohio
proceedings
and
very
properly
so
i
am
sure,
your
honor.
i
was
not
a
party
to
that
litigation.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
i
do
not
believe
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
our
issue
is
on
constitutional
law
and
i
would
particularly
ask
the
court
to
have
in
mind
two
cases
which
we
have
cited
in
the
brief.
armstrong
against
manzo
and
griffin
against
griffin,
particularly
the
latter
which
was
decided
by
this
court
in
an
opinion
by
mr.
chief
justice
stone
where
the
shifting
of
the
verdict
is
the
unconstitutional
aspect
of
things.
in
the
new
york
case,
they
imposed
the
burden
to
pay
alimony
without
hearing.
brought
it
down
here
and
filed
suit
on
it
and
it
was
held
by
this
court,
that
the
shifting
of
the
verdict,
the
post
judgment
determination
will
not
measure
up
to
constitutional
standards
of
due
process.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
yes
sir?
mr.
russell
morton
brown
i
think
mr.
chief
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
if
your
honor
please,
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
on
its
face
appears
to
be
the
thrust
of
the
fact.
however,
who
would
know
at
the
time
that
the
debtor
would
be
held
to
pay
for
something
he
never
got.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
now,
that
relates,
mr.
justice
brennan,
to
the
merits
that
should
be
determined
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
exactly!
precisely!
that
is
the
constitutional
issue
and
it
is
our
position
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way
mr.
justice
brennan.
if
it
turned
out
that
they
had
not
installed
the
equipment
at
all
or
material
part
of
it
was
omitted
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
no,
it
is
not
this
case.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
we
knew
what
it
meant,
your
honor,
and
he
had
to
pay
this
obligation,
but
i
submit.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
and
then
it
would
go
into
court
and
try
to
get
a
hearing
on
the
valid
defense
it
had
on
the
merits,
but
it
never
got
that.
it
is
our
position
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
in
manzo
and
in
griffin,
this
court
has
held
that
that
will
not
measure
up
to
constitutional
standard
of
due
process.
now,
let
me
just
say
one
thing
that
mr.
justice
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
russell
morton
brown
no,
he
was
the
father,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
well,
it
was
said
in
that
case
that
he
had
forfeited
his
right
because
he
had
not
kept
in
touch
and
supported
the
charge.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
well,
that
is
right,
but
the
court
said
that
you
cannot
adjudicate
these
rights
without
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
this
was
to
restrain
them
from
going
ahead.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
where
any
action
out
there
in
ohio
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
i
am
not
informed
and
i
would
be
inclined
to
think
that
that
is
immaterial,
your
honor.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
yes,
there
is
not
question
about
that.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
they
were
represented
by
a
counsel,
but
there
is
one
factor
i
would
like
to
emphasize
if
you
please
sir.
and
that
is
that
this
been
as
waiving
in
the
beginning,
before
you
know
what
the
controversy
is
about,
before
you
know
anything
about
it,
it
simply
does
not
conform
to
the
decisions
for
this
court.
now,
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
fact
that,
for
example,
now
as
a
judge
you
will
be
aware
of
course
that
all
this
information
about
the
prior
negotiations
would
not
be
admissible
as
fraud.
these
were
merged
in
the
notes.
that
is
the
contract
on
which
they
sue.
they
can
bring
up
all
this
prior
negotiation,
it
is
merged.
as
a
matter
of
evidentiary
law,
i
would
object
at
the
trial
and
the
court
would
sustain
that
objection,
i
am
sure.
nothing
can
modify
the
agreement
between
the
party
and
that
is
where
we
stand
here
as
you
place
it.
was
this
a
constitutional
agreement?
does
it
measure
up
to
standards
of
due
process?
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
be
heard?
all
that
has
been,
it
simply
says
he
got
consideration,
same
thing
applies
in
the
case
of
the
little
consumers.
they
got
it
something.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
thank
you
very
much.
