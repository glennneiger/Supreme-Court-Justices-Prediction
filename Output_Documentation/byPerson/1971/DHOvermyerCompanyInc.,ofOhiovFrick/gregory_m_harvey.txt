mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
facts
in
the
record
in
this
case
conclusively
refute
each
of
the
constitutional
contentions
which
have
just
been
advanced
and
by
that,
i
refer
to
both
the
facts
as
to
what
happened
between
frick
and
overmyer
over
a
period
of
several
years
prior
to
overmyer’s
default
on
the
second
installment
note
and
the
facts
as
to
what
subsequently
occurred,
first
in
the
district
court
in
new
york
and
what
occurred
in
the
state
courts
in
ohio.
now,
i
think
i
should
start,
just
by
making
reference
to
what
actually
happened
in
the
federal
district
court
in
new
york.
the
opinion
of
judge
mansfield
is
set
forth
in
full
in
the
appendix
at
page
81.
i
think
that
is
instructive
reading.
it
is
true
that
no
witnesses
appeared
in
the
new
york
proceeding,
but
that
is
because
overmyer
chose
to
present
no
witnesses.
at
page
81
through
83
in
the
record,
overmyer
presented
no
witnesses.
the
matter
is
gone
into
preceding
the
opinion
in
the
affidavits
of
new
york
counsel
who
handled
the
matter,
which
established
in
judge
mansfield’s
opinion
that
there
was
no
merit
to
overmyer’s
position.
i
think
that
is
merely
one
example
of
how
the
record
has
not
accurately
been
stated
in
the
briefs
for
the
petitioners.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
nixon
is
an
overmyer
affiliate,
your
honor,
which
was
the
construction
company
for
whom
frick
performed
the
subcontract.
so
nixon
is
overmyer
for
the
purposes.
now,
i
think
to
proceed
chronologically
–-
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
yes
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
well,
your
honor
i
would
have
to
go
outside
the
record
to
answer
that.
i
will
do
so,
only
if
the
court
requests
me
to.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
now
that
action
is
not,
but
there
is
another
action
pending.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
i
believe
it
was
dismissed
by
agreement
as
to
moot
or
dismissed
by
overmyer
as
a
matter
of
fact
voluntarily,
i
am
informed
by
my
associate.
i
think
we
have
to
start
chronologically
from
the
beginning
to
establish
briefly
just
what
occurred
prior
to
the
litigation.
it
is
very
important
to
the
case,
both
on
the
constitutional
issues
and
because
what
happened
between
frick
and
overmyer
was
the
basis
for
the
ohio
court’s
decisions
that
overmyer
had
no
valid
defense
to
the
note,
although
it
might
well
have
a
counter
claim
for
breach
of
warranty
to
be
asserted
separately
against
frick.
now,
the
first
contract
relevant
to
the
case
was
the
original
construction
subcontract
which
has
been
described
for
the
installation
of
refrigeration
machinery
in
a
warehouse
under
construction
in
toledo.
the
record
before
you,
printed
in
the
appendix,
establishes
that
overmyer
consistently
failed
to
make
the
progress
payments
which
were
required
under
that
constructions
subcontract.
and
frick
accordingly,
after
numerous
demands
for
payment
which
were
again
printed
in
the
appendix,
frick
accordingly,
stop
to
work
and
as
to
what
is
right
under
ohio
law
recorded
mechanic’s
liens
against
the
property
in
a
total
amount
of
194,000
and
some
odd
dollars.
those
liens
have
never
been
challenged
at
any
stage
in
this
proceeding.
three
months
later,
frick,
the
respondent
here
agreed
to
an
overmyer
proposal
for
extended
terms
of
payment.
frick
agreed
to
take
10%
of
the
balance
then
due
and
owing
in
cash
and
the
remainder
in
12
monthly
installments
with
interest
at
6-1/2%.
the
effect
of
that
was
that
instead
of
being
paid
in
full
in
october
1966,
as
required
by
the
original
contract,
frick
agreed
to
receive
the
final
payment
in
february
of
1968
and
overmyer
accordingly
executed
the
first
installment
note
which
is
in
the
record
at
page
51,
which
contains
no
confession
of
judgment
clause
and
which
in
language
which
appears
in
the
middle
of
appendix
page
52,
expressly
preserves
frick’s
mechanic’s
liens
against
the
property.
frick
agreed
to
forgo
their
enforcement
so
long
is
there
is
no
default.
immediately
after
delivery
by
overmyer
to
frick
of
this
first
installment
note,
frick
completed
the
work,
placed
the
system
in
operation,
conducted
a
demonstration
of
the
system
and
formally
requested
of
overmyer
that
it
accepted
the
system.
overmyer
did
accept
the
system
and
the
acceptance
documents
are
also
printed
in
the
record
at
page
54.
now,
under
the
subcontract
and
the
subcontract
is
in
the
record,
although
not
printed
in
the
appendix,
but
under
the
subcontract,
if
overmyer
had
been
dissatisfied
with
the
system,
overmyer
was
required
to
give
written
notice
of
the
alleged
deficiencies
and
frick
was
required
under
the
subcontract
to
correct
those
deficiencies
to
overmyer’s
satisfaction.
i
think
this
is
very
important
because
the
original
construction
subcontract
reserved
to
overmyer’s
engineer
the
final
determination
of
whether
the
work
done
was
in
accordance
with
the
specifications.
on
the
other
hand,
however,
the
effect
of
overmyer’s
written
acceptance
which
you
see
in
the
record
at
page
54
was
to
waive
all
claims
except
those
which
might
be
made
under
the
continuing
warranty
provisions
of
the
contract
which
are
also
in
the
appendix
and
overmyer’s
failure
to
specify
in
writing
any
deficiencies
of
course
would
have
the
same
effect
under
the
contract,
but
overmyer
did
formally
accept
the
work.
now,
the
next
development
in
the
relations
between
the
two
sides
--
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
yes
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
i
am
about
to
get
to
that.
we
are
not
to
that
stage
chronologically.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
yes,
that
is
exactly
the
stage
at
which
i
am.
overmyer
desired
to
have
the
liens
released,
that
is
my
point
in
the
record
at
several
points.
why
they
so
desired
is
not
clear,
but
it
was
apparently
an
urgent
desire.
i
comment
first
on
reasons
for
it.
there
were
negotiations.
there
were
exchanges
of
correspondence
between
general
counsel
for
overmyer
and
the
counsel
for
frick.
negotiations
were
conducted
largely
through
lawyers
on
both
sides.
the
result
of
those
negotiations
was
the
execution
of
the
second
installment
note,
which
did
three
things
very
favorable
to
overmyer.
first,
it
extended
the
term
time
of
payment
for
21
months.
so
instead
of
getting
the
money
in
full
in
october
1966,
which
had
then
been
extended
to
february
1968,
frick
now
agreed
to
wait
till
february
of
1969.
second,
the
rate
of
interest
was
reduced
by
half
point.
third,
frick
agreed
in
the
second
note
to
release
and
frick
actually
did
release
the
three
mechanic’s
liens.
i
think
that
the
text
of
the
note
is
instructive
in
that.
it
appears
at
page
6
and
7
of
the
record.
you
will
see
on
page
7
of
the
appendix
that
the
two
provisions
follow
immediately
upon
them
and
there
is
in
the
record,
the
affidavit
of
the
frick
person
responsible
for
the
work
to
the
effect,
but
in
frick’s
mind
the
two
were
linked,
that
appears
in
the
middle
of
page
32,
mr.
justice
brennan.
in
other
words
that
frick
was
willing
to
extend
the
time
of
payment
so
long
as
it
could
obtain
security
and
the
security
which
frick
desired
was
either
the
mechanic’s
liens
which
it
thought
were
adequate
security
or
a
bundle
of
other
rights,
including
first
the
confession
of
judgment
clause,
second
mortgages
and
i
think
that
is
it.
that
was
the
additional
security,
but
it
is
clear
from
the
record
and
another
point,
mr.
justice
brennan
also,
i
refer
to
frick’s
letter
of
october
10
reproduced
in
the
record
at
page
49,
the
second
numbered
paragraph
of
that
letter
says,
“in
lieu
of
actual
cash,
frick
has
indicated
their
willingness
to
accept
$35,000.00,”
i
am
just
giving
you
the
high
points,
“provided
the
balance
can
be
evidenced
by
interest-bearing
judgment
note.”
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
well,
the
second
installment
note
was
an
interest-bearing
judgment
note,
a
note
containing
a
confession
of
judgment
clause
and
bearing
interest.
the
first
installment
note,
however,
was
not
a
judgment
note
and
frick
did
not
require
so
long
as
the
mechanic’s
liens
continued
on
the
record
and
a
confession
of
judgment
clause.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
yes,
it
is.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
and
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
due
to
clerical
error
at
some
stage
the
letter
at
page
59
has
been
truncated.
the
last
three
paragraphs
refer
explicitly
to
a
release
of
the
mechanic’s
liens
and
request
that
frick
make
arrangements
with
its
local
counsel
in
toledo
to
be
able
to
have
those
released
promptly
and
then
that
is
referred
to
again
in
the
letter
on
page
60.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
i
think
there
is
no
doubt
on
the
entire
record
and
of
course
it
is
a
small
record
before
you.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
that
is
correct
and
of
course
the
first
note
was
secured
that
it
falls
under
the
original
contract.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
by
three
mechanic’s
liens.
yes,
it
is
plain
as
can
be
that
that
is
what
actually
happened
and
i
think
skipping
ahead
in
my
argument
somewhat
that
that
creates
what
is
a
very
unique
situation,
but
the
court
has
passed
on
it
before
in
the
shepherd
case
in
194
u.s.
which
i
cite,
it
creates
an
estoppel
situation.
the
mechanic’s
liens
were
of
record.
they
were
regarded
by
frick
as
entirely
satisfactory
security.
overmyer
desired
that
they
be
released.
frick
had
no
interest
in
obtaining
overmyer’s
consent
to
this
judgment
note.
frick
could
have
gotten
his
money
earlier
under
the
first
installment
note.
overmyer
induced
frick
to
release
the
mechanic’s
liens
and
take
in
consideration
for
that
the
confession
of
judgment
clause.
both
parties
knew
what
they
were
doing
and
since
if
it
involves
any
constitutional
right
at
all
it
is
merely
a
due
process
right
for
the
protection
of
property
rights
and
not
individual
freedom.
that
is
estoppel
situation
and
this
court
should
never
reach
the
question
of
constitutionality.
i
think
that
is
a
decisive
argument
if
in
fact
you
ever
get
to
that
stage.
now,
if
i
may
take
up
the
constitutional
issue
of
voluntariness
first
because
it
follows
from
what
i
have
just
said.
there
is
the
estoppel
argument.
there
is
also
the
fact
that
is
plainly
not
a
contract
of
adhesion
in
the
hamingson
or
the
walker
furniture
case
from
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
compare
the
first
note
with
the
second
note,
it
is
plain
that
frick
does
not
require
of
its
customers
that
they
sign
confession
of
judgment
clauses.
also,
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
there
has
been
a
disparity
of
bargaining
power
on
the
two
sides
or
in
which
a
poor,
poor
in
the
economic
sense
individual
of
limited
education,
has
been
seduced
into
signing
something
the
meaning
of
which
he
does
not
know.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
they
where
made
and
type
as
best
i
can
determine
mr.
justice
brennan,
typed
on
the
typewriter
of
general
counsel
for
overmyer
and
transmitted
by
him
and
insofar
as
the
record
shows
prepared
by
general
counsel
for
overmyer
and
that
maybe
why,
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
text
of
the
confession
clause
is
about
the
most
favorable
to
the
judgment
debtor
that
i
ever
seen.
and
i
am
a
pennsylvania
lawyer
i
would
urge
you
to
compare
that
confession
clause
on
page
7
in
the
instant
record
with
the
typical
pennsylvanian
notes
which
will
be
before
you
in
an
hour,
compare
them
also
with
the
typical
delaware
note
which
appears
at
page
1353
in
the
osmond
decision
that
is
in
327
f
2nd
and
you
will
see
that
this
is
a
very
limited
form
of
power
to
confess
judgment.
i
just
like
to
make
one
other
point,
under
voluntariness
and
that
is
this.
the
transaction,
which
resulted
in
the
second
installment
note,
was
not
priorly
to
the
benefit
of
overmyer
insofar
as
the
record
shows.
there
was
nothing
of
any
substance
and
nothing
of
any
value
that
frick
obtained
from
that
transaction
and
i
think
that
distinguishes
it
again
perhaps
from
those
retail
cases
in
which
it
might
be
argued,
i
am
sure,
it
will
be
argued,
the
consumer
gets
nothing
for
signing
the
confession
of
judgment
clause,
that
is
not
the
case
here.
here
overmyer
obtained
a
very
tangible
benefit,
the
release
the
liens.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
none
whatsoever.
in
fact,
it
reflects
quite
to
a
contrary
mr.
chief
justice.
at
least
an
implicit
recognition
in
the
first
installment
note
and
that
is
set
forth
at
page
52,
an
implicit
recognition
that
the
liens
were
valid
and
that
overmyer
requested
frick
forgo
enforcement
of
the
liens.
i
think
i
may
comment
there
of
course
with
that.
a
mechanic’s
lien
is
a
very,
very
severe
weapon
in
the
law.
it
is
an
equitable
proceeding.
there
is
no
right
to
jury
trial.
it
is
in
rem.
it
operates
against
the
property.
the
property
can
be
sold
off
by
the
sheriff
and
there
are
very
few
defenses
which
the
court
recognized
under
mechanics
–-
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
yes,
and
that
was
done
and
there
is
also
a
provision
by
which
the
debtor
may
give
notice
to
the
lien
holder
to
proceed
to
enforcement
and
so
that
the
question
whether
the
lien
is
valid
must
be
promptly
resolved.
so
overmyer
had
the
right
to
test
the
liens
if
it
desired,
but
it
never
did
so.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
oh
yes,
absolutely!
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
it
could
had
been
raised
as
a
defense
(voice
overlap).
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
to
that
extent.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
well,
in
this
transaction
and
of
course,
bear
in
mind
this
transaction
was
negotiated
two
months
after
overmyer
had
executed
the
unconditional
acceptance,
which
appears
at
page
54
of
the
record.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
yes.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
yes.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
it
would
have
to
have
been
dealt
with
under
the
--
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
well,
notice
had
been
waived
in
the
confession
of
judgment
clause.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
i
think
it
is
clear
no
direct
--
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
no,
i
want
to
get
to
the
hearing
question.
i
am
dealing
just
with
notice.
now,
also
the
record
in
this
case
establishes
that
the
absence
of
notice
in
the
sense
of
a
notice
we
are
going
to
proceed
on
the
note,
notice
was
of
no
detriment,
lack
of
notice
was
of
no
detriment
to
overmyer.
the
first
notice
which
frick,
my
client
received
that
overmyer
intended
to
default
on
the
note
with
the
service
upon
it
of
an
ex
parte
restraining
order
obtained
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
from
judge
frankel,
restraining
their
entry
of
judgment
on
the
note.
only
at
that
point,
did
frick
know
that
it
was
not
going
to
be
paid
that
monthly
installment.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
well,
it
knew
that
there
was
going
to
be
a
claim
raised
as
a
defense
to
the
note
and
the
exact
claim
which
is
raised
is
set
forth
in
the
record.
yes,
they
knew
at
that
point.
but
what
proceed
--
i
think
your
question
is
answered
by
what
happened
in
the
ohio
courts
with
respect
to
these
defenses,
which
i
think
it
is
your
question.
did
overmyer
actually
have
a
chance
to
assert
its
defenses
which
i
think
is
where
your
question
takes
us
and
the
record
on
that
point
is
very
clear.
if
you
look
at
the
text
of
the
note,
the
note
does
only
two
things.
it
waives
notice
and
it
waives
a
prejudgment
hearing.
it
certainly
does
not
purport
to
waive
a
post
judgment
hearing.
some
of
the
notes
which
will
be
before
you
later
today
do
purport
to
that
and
do
purport
to
waive
the
rights
to
appeal
and
various
other
things.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
right,
or
things
like
this
and
there
are
such
notes
i
have
seen
them.
this
note
does
none
of
those
things.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
it
is
at
page
6
and
7.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
now
this
note
and
it
is
page
7
is
the
only
page,
which
is
relevant.
it
is
short.
it
is
simple.
it
waives
a
prejudgment
hearing,
but
it
does
not
waive
a
post
judgment
hearing
and
this
is
what
most
important.
the
note
does
not
waive
any
defenses
whatsoever
and
what
actually
happened
is
that
overmyer
presented
its
defenses
to
the
ohio
courts
when
it
is
said
that
there
was
only
oral
argument,
the
record
is
not
being
correctly
stated
to
this
court.
i
urge
you
to
have
the
original
record,
this
thick
brought
before
you
to
see
how
many
papers
were
filed,
how
much
factual
material
was
presented
to
the
court
by
way
of
affidavits,
how
much
informal
testimony
was
delivered
by
mr.
garrigan
(ph),
attorney
for
overmyer
who
came
in
--
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
this
is
all
on
the
motion
to
vacate.
there
were
several
hearings.
a
few
excerpts
merely
from
the
hearings
are
included
at
pages
28
and
29,
but
i
refer
you
the
page
29,
towards
the
end
of
the
page
where
the
court
expressly
gives
overmyer.
it
says,
“i
want
to
give
him
a
reasonable
time
to
file
whatever
he
wants
to”
and
they
filed
a
great
deal
of
what
they
wanted
to
file
and
it
is
now
in
the
record
before
this
court
and
it
is
our
contention
that
overmyer
received
a
very
full
hearing
and
adjudication
on
its
defenses.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
alright,
if
i
can
answer
that
by
starting
first
with
the
ohio
procedure
and
then
i
will
give
you
the
exact
basis
of
the
adjudication.
the
ohio
procedure
on
a
motion
to
vacate
requires
that
the
trial
court
do
two
things.
first
--
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
yes,
surely.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
not
really,
there
used
to
be
a
distinction
between
filing
in
term
and
out
of
term
of
which
the
recent
decisions
really
tend
to
overlook.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
yes.
in
this
case,
however,
it
was
filed
in
term
immediately
after
and
therefore
it
is
the
term
distinction
in
this
court
as
in
others
is
tending
to
become.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
yes.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
yes,
indeed.
the
court
must
give
notice
and
the
notice
went
out
in
this
case
to
five
different
overmyer
locations
and
so
far
as
i
am
aware
which
received
in
all
of
them.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
notice
by
mail,
yes
and
the
notice,
the
form
of
notice
appears
in
the
record
here
and
the
docket
entries
reflects
the
places
to
which
a
notice
was
sent,
that
is
page
1
and
2,
you
will
see
sets
forth
all
the
places
that
notice
was
sent.
now,
the
ohio
court’s
have
a
two-step
procedure
which
the
trial
court
takes
in
passing
on
a
motion
to
vacate.
first,
is
to
determine
whether
the
judgment
debtor
has
presented
a
valid
defense
and
that
is
a
question
of
examining
the
pleadings,
that
does
not
go
to
whether
is
meritorious
or
whether
it
will
eventually
prevail,
that
is
just,
has
he
pleaded
a
valid
defense
and
then
second
since
under
the
ohio
procedure,
you
are
not
supposed
to
plead
your
evidence
and
it
is
a
very
special
pleading
system,
under
to
the
ohio
procedure
you
are
not
supposed
to
plead
your
evidence.
the
next
step
is
to
determine
whether
there
is
some
evidence
adduced
by
way
of
affidavit,
testimony
in
open
court,
deposition
or
anything
else
by
the
judgment
debtor
which
would
avoid
a
directed
verdict
against
him,
if
the
matter
went
to
trial,
very
similar
to
avoidance
of
summary
judgment
in
the
federal
procedure,
any
show
of
an
issue
or
fact.
if
that
occurs,
he
presents
a
valid
pleading
and
enough
evidence
in
support
of
it
to
avoid
judgment
against
him,
then
the
court
has
the
duty,
that
is
the
phrase
used,
has
the
duty
in
the
ohio
cases
to
open
the
judgment
and
a
full
trial
is
had
in
which
there
is
a
right
to
trial
by
jury
if
demanded,
in
which
the
burdens
are
the
same
as
in
a
normal
proceeding
not
started
by
confession
of
judgment
and
the
result
is
the
determination
either
that
the
judgment
was
good
in
which
case
it
is
confirmed
and
relates
back
or
that
the
judgment
is
stricken.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
yes.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
well,
i
mean
that
the
burden
on
overmyer
to
present
evidence
and
support
of
its
affirmative
defenses
in
that
plenary
proceeding
following
the
opening
of
the
judgment
if
that
occurred,
would
be
the
same.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
as
in
a
normal
trial
(voice
overlap)
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
merely
brought
suit
without
attempting
to
confess
judgment.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
yes.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
all
of
that
could
happen,
could
still
have
happened
in
that
proceeding
if
overmyer
chose
to
prosecute
it
there.
they
could
have
kept
going,
the
answer
could
have
--
the
counterclaims
could
have
been
filed.
they
could
have
proceeded
to
a
trial.
they
did
not.
now,
what
the,
and
as
my
time
is
just
about
to
expire,
what
that
court
of
appeals
held
and
i
refer
you
to
page
84
of
the
record,
the
motion
for
reconsideration,
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
and
unfortunately
it
is
not
in
the
appendix,
but
it
is
in
the
docket
entries
which
are
part
of
the
record
in
this
court,
the
court
of
appeals
said,
“finding
that
the
defendant’s
appellants
failed
to
prove
the
existence
of
a
valid
defense;
further
finding
there
from
that
the
answer
and
cross
petition
of
defendant’s
appellants
constituted
only
a
counterclaim
to
the
petition
on
the
judgment
note”
and
they
go
on
to
hold
that
the
judgment
properly
was
not
opened.
the
entire
constitutional
issue
presented
here,
may
it
please
the
court,
depends
upon
overmyer’s
contention
that
it
had
a
valid
defense
rather
than
a
counterclaim,
but
the
ohio
courts
for
reasons
which
i
think
are
not
properly
to
be
passed
upon
by
this
court,
but
with
which
this
court
would
agree,
if
you
have
the
factual
background,
the
ohio
courts
found
that
there
was
no
valid
defense
as
a
matter
of
the
pleadings
that
there
was
a
counterclaim.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
because
under
ohio
law,
mr.
justice
brennan,
if
it
is
only
a
counterclaim
then
that
maybe
litigated
in
the
same
proceeding
and
eventually
there
maybe
judgment
in
favor
of
the
judgment
debtor
against
the
judgment
creditor
in
the
amount
of
the
counterclaims,
but
since
it
is
only
a
counterclaim
under
ohio
law,
it
is
no
defense
to
an
obligation
of
the
certainty
of
the
second
installment
note
which
was
a
replacement
for
the
first
installment
note
--
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
absolutely,
absolutely.
they
were
not
cut-off
from
proceeding
on
that.
they
had
the
full
right
to
assert
it.
they
have
in
fact
asserted
it
in
new
york
in
another
civil
action
and
the
matter
is
still
open
and
still
available
to
them.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
no,
it
is
now
pending,
may
it
please
the
court,
in
the
southern
district
--
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
well,
they
have
proceeded
no
further
with
the
ohio
matter
because
it
has
been
constantly
on
appeal,
but
they
did
assert
the
counterclaim
in
a
separate
civil
action
in
new
york
filed
december
20,
1968,
an
answer
was
filed
within
20
days.
there
has
been
no
action
taken
to
prosecute
that
proceeding.
no
action
whatsoever.
counterclaim
was
still
open
and
available
to
them.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
facts
in
the
record
in
this
case
conclusively
refute
each
of
the
constitutional
contentions
which
have
just
been
advanced
and
by
that,
i
refer
to
both
the
facts
as
to
what
happened
between
frick
and
overmyer
over
a
period
of
several
years
prior
to
overmyer’s
default
on
the
second
installment
note
and
the
facts
as
to
what
subsequently
occurred,
first
in
the
district
court
in
new
york
and
what
occurred
in
the
state
courts
in
ohio.
now,
i
think
i
should
start,
just
by
making
reference
to
what
actually
happened
in
the
federal
district
court
in
new
york.
the
opinion
of
judge
mansfield
is
set
forth
in
full
in
the
appendix
at
page
81.
i
think
that
is
instructive
reading.
it
is
true
that
no
witnesses
appeared
in
the
new
york
proceeding,
but
that
is
because
overmyer
chose
to
present
no
witnesses.
at
page
81
through
83
in
the
record,
overmyer
presented
no
witnesses.
the
matter
is
gone
into
preceding
the
opinion
in
the
affidavits
of
new
york
counsel
who
handled
the
matter,
which
established
in
judge
mansfield’s
opinion
that
there
was
no
merit
to
overmyer’s
position.
i
think
that
is
merely
one
example
of
how
the
record
has
not
accurately
been
stated
in
the
briefs
for
the
petitioners.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
nixon
is
an
overmyer
affiliate,
your
honor,
which
was
the
construction
company
for
whom
frick
performed
the
subcontract.
so
nixon
is
overmyer
for
the
purposes.
now,
i
think
to
proceed
chronologically
–-
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
yes
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
well,
your
honor
i
would
have
to
go
outside
the
record
to
answer
that.
i
will
do
so,
only
if
the
court
requests
me
to.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
now
that
action
is
not,
but
there
is
another
action
pending.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
i
believe
it
was
dismissed
by
agreement
as
to
moot
or
dismissed
by
overmyer
as
a
matter
of
fact
voluntarily,
i
am
informed
by
my
associate.
i
think
we
have
to
start
chronologically
from
the
beginning
to
establish
briefly
just
what
occurred
prior
to
the
litigation.
it
is
very
important
to
the
case,
both
on
the
constitutional
issues
and
because
what
happened
between
frick
and
overmyer
was
the
basis
for
the
ohio
court’s
decisions
that
overmyer
had
no
valid
defense
to
the
note,
although
it
might
well
have
a
counter
claim
for
breach
of
warranty
to
be
asserted
separately
against
frick.
now,
the
first
contract
relevant
to
the
case
was
the
original
construction
subcontract
which
has
been
described
for
the
installation
of
refrigeration
machinery
in
a
warehouse
under
construction
in
toledo.
the
record
before
you,
printed
in
the
appendix,
establishes
that
overmyer
consistently
failed
to
make
the
progress
payments
which
were
required
under
that
constructions
subcontract.
and
frick
accordingly,
after
numerous
demands
for
payment
which
were
again
printed
in
the
appendix,
frick
accordingly,
stop
to
work
and
as
to
what
is
right
under
ohio
law
recorded
mechanic’s
liens
against
the
property
in
a
total
amount
of
194,000
and
some
odd
dollars.
those
liens
have
never
been
challenged
at
any
stage
in
this
proceeding.
three
months
later,
frick,
the
respondent
here
agreed
to
an
overmyer
proposal
for
extended
terms
of
payment.
frick
agreed
to
take
10%
of
the
balance
then
due
and
owing
in
cash
and
the
remainder
in
12
monthly
installments
with
interest
at
6-1/2%.
the
effect
of
that
was
that
instead
of
being
paid
in
full
in
october
1966,
as
required
by
the
original
contract,
frick
agreed
to
receive
the
final
payment
in
february
of
1968
and
overmyer
accordingly
executed
the
first
installment
note
which
is
in
the
record
at
page
51,
which
contains
no
confession
of
judgment
clause
and
which
in
language
which
appears
in
the
middle
of
appendix
page
52,
expressly
preserves
frick’s
mechanic’s
liens
against
the
property.
frick
agreed
to
forgo
their
enforcement
so
long
is
there
is
no
default.
immediately
after
delivery
by
overmyer
to
frick
of
this
first
installment
note,
frick
completed
the
work,
placed
the
system
in
operation,
conducted
a
demonstration
of
the
system
and
formally
requested
of
overmyer
that
it
accepted
the
system.
overmyer
did
accept
the
system
and
the
acceptance
documents
are
also
printed
in
the
record
at
page
54.
now,
under
the
subcontract
and
the
subcontract
is
in
the
record,
although
not
printed
in
the
appendix,
but
under
the
subcontract,
if
overmyer
had
been
dissatisfied
with
the
system,
overmyer
was
required
to
give
written
notice
of
the
alleged
deficiencies
and
frick
was
required
under
the
subcontract
to
correct
those
deficiencies
to
overmyer’s
satisfaction.
i
think
this
is
very
important
because
the
original
construction
subcontract
reserved
to
overmyer’s
engineer
the
final
determination
of
whether
the
work
done
was
in
accordance
with
the
specifications.
on
the
other
hand,
however,
the
effect
of
overmyer’s
written
acceptance
which
you
see
in
the
record
at
page
54
was
to
waive
all
claims
except
those
which
might
be
made
under
the
continuing
warranty
provisions
of
the
contract
which
are
also
in
the
appendix
and
overmyer’s
failure
to
specify
in
writing
any
deficiencies
of
course
would
have
the
same
effect
under
the
contract,
but
overmyer
did
formally
accept
the
work.
now,
the
next
development
in
the
relations
between
the
two
sides
--
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
yes
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
i
am
about
to
get
to
that.
we
are
not
to
that
stage
chronologically.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
yes,
that
is
exactly
the
stage
at
which
i
am.
overmyer
desired
to
have
the
liens
released,
that
is
my
point
in
the
record
at
several
points.
why
they
so
desired
is
not
clear,
but
it
was
apparently
an
urgent
desire.
i
comment
first
on
reasons
for
it.
there
were
negotiations.
there
were
exchanges
of
correspondence
between
general
counsel
for
overmyer
and
the
counsel
for
frick.
negotiations
were
conducted
largely
through
lawyers
on
both
sides.
the
result
of
those
negotiations
was
the
execution
of
the
second
installment
note,
which
did
three
things
very
favorable
to
overmyer.
first,
it
extended
the
term
time
of
payment
for
21
months.
so
instead
of
getting
the
money
in
full
in
october
1966,
which
had
then
been
extended
to
february
1968,
frick
now
agreed
to
wait
till
february
of
1969.
second,
the
rate
of
interest
was
reduced
by
half
point.
third,
frick
agreed
in
the
second
note
to
release
and
frick
actually
did
release
the
three
mechanic’s
liens.
i
think
that
the
text
of
the
note
is
instructive
in
that.
it
appears
at
page
6
and
7
of
the
record.
you
will
see
on
page
7
of
the
appendix
that
the
two
provisions
follow
immediately
upon
them
and
there
is
in
the
record,
the
affidavit
of
the
frick
person
responsible
for
the
work
to
the
effect,
but
in
frick’s
mind
the
two
were
linked,
that
appears
in
the
middle
of
page
32,
mr.
justice
brennan.
in
other
words
that
frick
was
willing
to
extend
the
time
of
payment
so
long
as
it
could
obtain
security
and
the
security
which
frick
desired
was
either
the
mechanic’s
liens
which
it
thought
were
adequate
security
or
a
bundle
of
other
rights,
including
first
the
confession
of
judgment
clause,
second
mortgages
and
i
think
that
is
it.
that
was
the
additional
security,
but
it
is
clear
from
the
record
and
another
point,
mr.
justice
brennan
also,
i
refer
to
frick’s
letter
of
october
10
reproduced
in
the
record
at
page
49,
the
second
numbered
paragraph
of
that
letter
says,
“in
lieu
of
actual
cash,
frick
has
indicated
their
willingness
to
accept
$35,000.00,”
i
am
just
giving
you
the
high
points,
“provided
the
balance
can
be
evidenced
by
interest-bearing
judgment
note.”
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
well,
the
second
installment
note
was
an
interest-bearing
judgment
note,
a
note
containing
a
confession
of
judgment
clause
and
bearing
interest.
the
first
installment
note,
however,
was
not
a
judgment
note
and
frick
did
not
require
so
long
as
the
mechanic’s
liens
continued
on
the
record
and
a
confession
of
judgment
clause.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
yes,
it
is.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
and
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
due
to
clerical
error
at
some
stage
the
letter
at
page
59
has
been
truncated.
the
last
three
paragraphs
refer
explicitly
to
a
release
of
the
mechanic’s
liens
and
request
that
frick
make
arrangements
with
its
local
counsel
in
toledo
to
be
able
to
have
those
released
promptly
and
then
that
is
referred
to
again
in
the
letter
on
page
60.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
i
think
there
is
no
doubt
on
the
entire
record
and
of
course
it
is
a
small
record
before
you.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
that
is
correct
and
of
course
the
first
note
was
secured
that
it
falls
under
the
original
contract.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
by
three
mechanic’s
liens.
yes,
it
is
plain
as
can
be
that
that
is
what
actually
happened
and
i
think
skipping
ahead
in
my
argument
somewhat
that
that
creates
what
is
a
very
unique
situation,
but
the
court
has
passed
on
it
before
in
the
shepherd
case
in
194
u.s.
which
i
cite,
it
creates
an
estoppel
situation.
the
mechanic’s
liens
were
of
record.
they
were
regarded
by
frick
as
entirely
satisfactory
security.
overmyer
desired
that
they
be
released.
frick
had
no
interest
in
obtaining
overmyer’s
consent
to
this
judgment
note.
frick
could
have
gotten
his
money
earlier
under
the
first
installment
note.
overmyer
induced
frick
to
release
the
mechanic’s
liens
and
take
in
consideration
for
that
the
confession
of
judgment
clause.
both
parties
knew
what
they
were
doing
and
since
if
it
involves
any
constitutional
right
at
all
it
is
merely
a
due
process
right
for
the
protection
of
property
rights
and
not
individual
freedom.
that
is
estoppel
situation
and
this
court
should
never
reach
the
question
of
constitutionality.
i
think
that
is
a
decisive
argument
if
in
fact
you
ever
get
to
that
stage.
now,
if
i
may
take
up
the
constitutional
issue
of
voluntariness
first
because
it
follows
from
what
i
have
just
said.
there
is
the
estoppel
argument.
there
is
also
the
fact
that
is
plainly
not
a
contract
of
adhesion
in
the
hamingson
or
the
walker
furniture
case
from
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
compare
the
first
note
with
the
second
note,
it
is
plain
that
frick
does
not
require
of
its
customers
that
they
sign
confession
of
judgment
clauses.
also,
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
there
has
been
a
disparity
of
bargaining
power
on
the
two
sides
or
in
which
a
poor,
poor
in
the
economic
sense
individual
of
limited
education,
has
been
seduced
into
signing
something
the
meaning
of
which
he
does
not
know.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
they
where
made
and
type
as
best
i
can
determine
mr.
justice
brennan,
typed
on
the
typewriter
of
general
counsel
for
overmyer
and
transmitted
by
him
and
insofar
as
the
record
shows
prepared
by
general
counsel
for
overmyer
and
that
maybe
why,
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
text
of
the
confession
clause
is
about
the
most
favorable
to
the
judgment
debtor
that
i
ever
seen.
and
i
am
a
pennsylvania
lawyer
i
would
urge
you
to
compare
that
confession
clause
on
page
7
in
the
instant
record
with
the
typical
pennsylvanian
notes
which
will
be
before
you
in
an
hour,
compare
them
also
with
the
typical
delaware
note
which
appears
at
page
1353
in
the
osmond
decision
that
is
in
327
f
2nd
and
you
will
see
that
this
is
a
very
limited
form
of
power
to
confess
judgment.
i
just
like
to
make
one
other
point,
under
voluntariness
and
that
is
this.
the
transaction,
which
resulted
in
the
second
installment
note,
was
not
priorly
to
the
benefit
of
overmyer
insofar
as
the
record
shows.
there
was
nothing
of
any
substance
and
nothing
of
any
value
that
frick
obtained
from
that
transaction
and
i
think
that
distinguishes
it
again
perhaps
from
those
retail
cases
in
which
it
might
be
argued,
i
am
sure,
it
will
be
argued,
the
consumer
gets
nothing
for
signing
the
confession
of
judgment
clause,
that
is
not
the
case
here.
here
overmyer
obtained
a
very
tangible
benefit,
the
release
the
liens.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
none
whatsoever.
in
fact,
it
reflects
quite
to
a
contrary
mr.
chief
justice.
at
least
an
implicit
recognition
in
the
first
installment
note
and
that
is
set
forth
at
page
52,
an
implicit
recognition
that
the
liens
were
valid
and
that
overmyer
requested
frick
forgo
enforcement
of
the
liens.
i
think
i
may
comment
there
of
course
with
that.
a
mechanic’s
lien
is
a
very,
very
severe
weapon
in
the
law.
it
is
an
equitable
proceeding.
there
is
no
right
to
jury
trial.
it
is
in
rem.
it
operates
against
the
property.
the
property
can
be
sold
off
by
the
sheriff
and
there
are
very
few
defenses
which
the
court
recognized
under
mechanics
–-
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
yes,
and
that
was
done
and
there
is
also
a
provision
by
which
the
debtor
may
give
notice
to
the
lien
holder
to
proceed
to
enforcement
and
so
that
the
question
whether
the
lien
is
valid
must
be
promptly
resolved.
so
overmyer
had
the
right
to
test
the
liens
if
it
desired,
but
it
never
did
so.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
oh
yes,
absolutely!
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
it
could
had
been
raised
as
a
defense
(voice
overlap).
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
to
that
extent.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
well,
in
this
transaction
and
of
course,
bear
in
mind
this
transaction
was
negotiated
two
months
after
overmyer
had
executed
the
unconditional
acceptance,
which
appears
at
page
54
of
the
record.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
yes.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
yes.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
it
would
have
to
have
been
dealt
with
under
the
--
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
well,
notice
had
been
waived
in
the
confession
of
judgment
clause.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
i
think
it
is
clear
no
direct
--
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
no,
i
want
to
get
to
the
hearing
question.
i
am
dealing
just
with
notice.
now,
also
the
record
in
this
case
establishes
that
the
absence
of
notice
in
the
sense
of
a
notice
we
are
going
to
proceed
on
the
note,
notice
was
of
no
detriment,
lack
of
notice
was
of
no
detriment
to
overmyer.
the
first
notice
which
frick,
my
client
received
that
overmyer
intended
to
default
on
the
note
with
the
service
upon
it
of
an
ex
parte
restraining
order
obtained
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
from
judge
frankel,
restraining
their
entry
of
judgment
on
the
note.
only
at
that
point,
did
frick
know
that
it
was
not
going
to
be
paid
that
monthly
installment.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
well,
it
knew
that
there
was
going
to
be
a
claim
raised
as
a
defense
to
the
note
and
the
exact
claim
which
is
raised
is
set
forth
in
the
record.
yes,
they
knew
at
that
point.
but
what
proceed
--
i
think
your
question
is
answered
by
what
happened
in
the
ohio
courts
with
respect
to
these
defenses,
which
i
think
it
is
your
question.
did
overmyer
actually
have
a
chance
to
assert
its
defenses
which
i
think
is
where
your
question
takes
us
and
the
record
on
that
point
is
very
clear.
if
you
look
at
the
text
of
the
note,
the
note
does
only
two
things.
it
waives
notice
and
it
waives
a
prejudgment
hearing.
it
certainly
does
not
purport
to
waive
a
post
judgment
hearing.
some
of
the
notes
which
will
be
before
you
later
today
do
purport
to
that
and
do
purport
to
waive
the
rights
to
appeal
and
various
other
things.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
right,
or
things
like
this
and
there
are
such
notes
i
have
seen
them.
this
note
does
none
of
those
things.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
it
is
at
page
6
and
7.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
now
this
note
and
it
is
page
7
is
the
only
page,
which
is
relevant.
it
is
short.
it
is
simple.
it
waives
a
prejudgment
hearing,
but
it
does
not
waive
a
post
judgment
hearing
and
this
is
what
most
important.
the
note
does
not
waive
any
defenses
whatsoever
and
what
actually
happened
is
that
overmyer
presented
its
defenses
to
the
ohio
courts
when
it
is
said
that
there
was
only
oral
argument,
the
record
is
not
being
correctly
stated
to
this
court.
i
urge
you
to
have
the
original
record,
this
thick
brought
before
you
to
see
how
many
papers
were
filed,
how
much
factual
material
was
presented
to
the
court
by
way
of
affidavits,
how
much
informal
testimony
was
delivered
by
mr.
garrigan
(ph),
attorney
for
overmyer
who
came
in
--
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
this
is
all
on
the
motion
to
vacate.
there
were
several
hearings.
a
few
excerpts
merely
from
the
hearings
are
included
at
pages
28
and
29,
but
i
refer
you
the
page
29,
towards
the
end
of
the
page
where
the
court
expressly
gives
overmyer.
it
says,
“i
want
to
give
him
a
reasonable
time
to
file
whatever
he
wants
to”
and
they
filed
a
great
deal
of
what
they
wanted
to
file
and
it
is
now
in
the
record
before
this
court
and
it
is
our
contention
that
overmyer
received
a
very
full
hearing
and
adjudication
on
its
defenses.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
alright,
if
i
can
answer
that
by
starting
first
with
the
ohio
procedure
and
then
i
will
give
you
the
exact
basis
of
the
adjudication.
the
ohio
procedure
on
a
motion
to
vacate
requires
that
the
trial
court
do
two
things.
first
--
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
yes,
surely.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
not
really,
there
used
to
be
a
distinction
between
filing
in
term
and
out
of
term
of
which
the
recent
decisions
really
tend
to
overlook.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
yes.
in
this
case,
however,
it
was
filed
in
term
immediately
after
and
therefore
it
is
the
term
distinction
in
this
court
as
in
others
is
tending
to
become.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
yes.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
yes,
indeed.
the
court
must
give
notice
and
the
notice
went
out
in
this
case
to
five
different
overmyer
locations
and
so
far
as
i
am
aware
which
received
in
all
of
them.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
notice
by
mail,
yes
and
the
notice,
the
form
of
notice
appears
in
the
record
here
and
the
docket
entries
reflects
the
places
to
which
a
notice
was
sent,
that
is
page
1
and
2,
you
will
see
sets
forth
all
the
places
that
notice
was
sent.
now,
the
ohio
court’s
have
a
two-step
procedure
which
the
trial
court
takes
in
passing
on
a
motion
to
vacate.
first,
is
to
determine
whether
the
judgment
debtor
has
presented
a
valid
defense
and
that
is
a
question
of
examining
the
pleadings,
that
does
not
go
to
whether
is
meritorious
or
whether
it
will
eventually
prevail,
that
is
just,
has
he
pleaded
a
valid
defense
and
then
second
since
under
the
ohio
procedure,
you
are
not
supposed
to
plead
your
evidence
and
it
is
a
very
special
pleading
system,
under
to
the
ohio
procedure
you
are
not
supposed
to
plead
your
evidence.
the
next
step
is
to
determine
whether
there
is
some
evidence
adduced
by
way
of
affidavit,
testimony
in
open
court,
deposition
or
anything
else
by
the
judgment
debtor
which
would
avoid
a
directed
verdict
against
him,
if
the
matter
went
to
trial,
very
similar
to
avoidance
of
summary
judgment
in
the
federal
procedure,
any
show
of
an
issue
or
fact.
if
that
occurs,
he
presents
a
valid
pleading
and
enough
evidence
in
support
of
it
to
avoid
judgment
against
him,
then
the
court
has
the
duty,
that
is
the
phrase
used,
has
the
duty
in
the
ohio
cases
to
open
the
judgment
and
a
full
trial
is
had
in
which
there
is
a
right
to
trial
by
jury
if
demanded,
in
which
the
burdens
are
the
same
as
in
a
normal
proceeding
not
started
by
confession
of
judgment
and
the
result
is
the
determination
either
that
the
judgment
was
good
in
which
case
it
is
confirmed
and
relates
back
or
that
the
judgment
is
stricken.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
yes.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
well,
i
mean
that
the
burden
on
overmyer
to
present
evidence
and
support
of
its
affirmative
defenses
in
that
plenary
proceeding
following
the
opening
of
the
judgment
if
that
occurred,
would
be
the
same.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
as
in
a
normal
trial
(voice
overlap)
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
merely
brought
suit
without
attempting
to
confess
judgment.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
yes.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
all
of
that
could
happen,
could
still
have
happened
in
that
proceeding
if
overmyer
chose
to
prosecute
it
there.
they
could
have
kept
going,
the
answer
could
have
--
the
counterclaims
could
have
been
filed.
they
could
have
proceeded
to
a
trial.
they
did
not.
now,
what
the,
and
as
my
time
is
just
about
to
expire,
what
that
court
of
appeals
held
and
i
refer
you
to
page
84
of
the
record,
the
motion
for
reconsideration,
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
and
unfortunately
it
is
not
in
the
appendix,
but
it
is
in
the
docket
entries
which
are
part
of
the
record
in
this
court,
the
court
of
appeals
said,
“finding
that
the
defendant’s
appellants
failed
to
prove
the
existence
of
a
valid
defense;
further
finding
there
from
that
the
answer
and
cross
petition
of
defendant’s
appellants
constituted
only
a
counterclaim
to
the
petition
on
the
judgment
note”
and
they
go
on
to
hold
that
the
judgment
properly
was
not
opened.
the
entire
constitutional
issue
presented
here,
may
it
please
the
court,
depends
upon
overmyer’s
contention
that
it
had
a
valid
defense
rather
than
a
counterclaim,
but
the
ohio
courts
for
reasons
which
i
think
are
not
properly
to
be
passed
upon
by
this
court,
but
with
which
this
court
would
agree,
if
you
have
the
factual
background,
the
ohio
courts
found
that
there
was
no
valid
defense
as
a
matter
of
the
pleadings
that
there
was
a
counterclaim.
mr.
gregory
m.
harvey
because
under
ohio
law,
mr.
justice
brennan,
if
it
is
only

judgment

of
the
judgment
debtor

the

creditor
in
the

but
since
it

only
a
counterclaim

asserted
it

no
further
with
the
ohio

it
has
been
constantly

civil
action
in

december
