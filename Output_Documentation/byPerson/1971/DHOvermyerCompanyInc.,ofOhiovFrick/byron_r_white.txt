justice
byron
r.
white
when
was
this
context
been
raised
in
the
state
courts?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that,
what
about
the
federal
question
raised,
has
been
presented
as
federal
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
supreme
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
supreme
court
deal
with
this
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
no
one
suggested
that
he
waived
the
right
to
recover
for
breach
of
warranty.
all
it
suggested
is
that
he
waived
his
right
to
present
this
as
a
defense
to
collection
of
the
note.
no
one
suggested
he
could
not
sue
the
breach
for
warranty?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
do
not
suggest
that
he
is
precluded
from
filing
his
own
suit
for
breach
of
warranty?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
is
in
no
different
position
than
if
there
had
been
a
negotiation
of
the
note
and
a
holder
in
due
course
sued
him?
do
you
think
he
had
have
a
defense
for
breach
of
warranty?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
and
then
he
just
has
to
sue
for
breach
of
warranty?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
this
note
never
was
negotiated
and
then
given
back
to
the
maker
when
it
was
the
default.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
say,
it
is
unconstitutional
to
waive
in
advance
the
right
to
present
a
defense
in
an
action
on
the
note?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
this
would
be
unconstitutional
if
the
note
said
that
he
waives
his
right
to
present
a
defense
in
an
action
on
the
note,
but
not
his
right
to
file
and
independent
suit
for
breach
of
warrant?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that,
there
is
judicial
foreclosure
of
the
mechanic’s
lien?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
that
proceeding,
breach
of
warranty
could
be
raised
to
the
defense?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
it
were
found
valid
that
would
had
been
a
judgment
against
the
plaintiff
to
that
extent?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
the
transaction,
plaintiff
retained
his
right
to
breach
of
warranty,
frick
admitted
those
were
not
being
made?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
us
assume
instead
of
confessing
judgment,
the
frick
had
just
sued
on
the
note.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
served
overmyer
as
they
could
have
found
them
and
overmyer
came
in
and
presented
a
defense
of
breach
of
warranty.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
that
would
have
to
been
dealt
with,
would
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
your
then
--
what
is
your
explanation
--
what
is
your
constitutional
ground
for
saying
that
the
in
the
confession
of
judgment
proceeding
overmyer
was
not
entitled
to
notice
and
a
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
right,
strictly
on
the
advance?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
knew
then
that
claims
of
breach
of
warranty
were
being
presented?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
any
cause
of
action
for
breach
of
warranty?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
in
the
appendix
is
the
note
itself?
justice
byron
r.
white
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
it
just
waived
the
particular
proceeding
or
form
which
had
presented
claim,
just
could
not
present
it,
just
waived
his
right
to
present
the
judgment
in
the
form
in
which
the
judge
--
presented
was
a
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
manzo
never
waived
his
right
to
notice?
justice
byron

manzo
never
or
