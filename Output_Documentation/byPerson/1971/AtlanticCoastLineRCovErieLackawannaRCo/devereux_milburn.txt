mr.
devereux
milburn
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
your
honors
please,
i
would
like
to
reserve
five
minutes
for
rebuttal
at
the
end
of
my
argument.
mr.
devereux
milburn
the
question
which
this
appeal
presents
to
the
court
is
whether
or
not
this
court
should
recognize
a
right
to
contribution
in
maritime
noncollision
cases.
an
obstacle
to
granting
such
a
right
is
halcyon
lines
against
haenn,
a
famous
case.
a
subsidiary
question
is
whether
contribution
by
the
erie
railroad
is
precluded
by
the
longshoremen
&
harbor
workers'
compensation
act.
an
alternative
is
should
the
court
of
appeals
have
applied
a
new
jersey
statue,
creating
a
right
of
contribution
by
supplementation.
the
factual
setting
in
which
these
questions
ought
to
be
decided
is
relatively
simple
and
can
be
briefly
stated.
an
action
was
commenced
in
may
of
1966
against
atlantic
by
a
plaintiff
benazet
for
injuries
he
sustained
on
july
30,
1964.
for
those
injuries,
erie
railroad
paid
him
compensation
under
the
act.
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
rested
on
diversity
of
the
citizenship.
a
box
car
belonging
to
atlantic,
but
on
erie's
tracks
and
having
been
in
erie's
possession
for
three
days,
rolled
down
the
erie's
tracks,
across
a
floating
bridge
and
on
to
a
car
float
which
was
floating.
benazet
climbed
of
the
back
of
the
box
car
to
adjust
the
brakes
and
while
turning
the
wheel,
the
brake
wheel,
the
foot
board
gave
away,
thus
throwing
his
weight
backwards
against
the
wheel
and
the
supports
of
the
wheel
gave
way
and
benazet
fell
to
the
deck
and
suffered
serious
injuries.
this
occurred
after
the
atlantic
box
car
had
been
through
many
railroads
as
stated
in
the
brief
for
erie
railroad.
erie,
although
it
had
a
duty
to
inspect
upon
receiving
the
car,
did
not
detect
the
decay
of
the
foot
board
or
the
fissure
in
the
supports
of
the
wheel
which
could
be
detected
from
the
ground.
the
case
was
--
as
was
set
aside,
the
case
was
tried
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
a
common
law
tort
and
a
maritime
law
was
not
thought
off
until
after
the
summation
by
both
counsel
and
just
prior
to
the
charge,
when
a
memorandum
was
submitted
that
this
thing,
that
the
box
car
was
on
it
was
float
and
not
attached
to
the
pier
and
not
attached
to
the
land
except
by
the
floating
bridge
and
therefore
maritime
law
applied.
counsel
were
given
from
5
'o
clock
that
evening
until
9
'o
clock
next
morning
to
readjust
their
thinking
and
suddenly
become
experts
in
maritime
law.
the
district
judge
gave
a
questionnaire
to
the
jurors.
the
jurors
found
that
atlantic
was
negligent.
the
jurors
found
that
erie
was
negligent
and
the
jurors
further
found
that
erie’s
negligence
was
a
substantial
factor
contributing
to
the
injuries
of
benazet.
the
judge,
judge
cooper
dismissed
atlantic's
third
party
claim
against
erie
on
the
ground
that
in
maritime
law,
no
right
of
contribution
existed
and
refused
supplementation
by
using
the
new
jersey
joint
tortfeasor's
contribution
act.
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed
while
finding
that
our
arguments
were
appealing,
nevertheless
stating
that
they
propound
by
the
halcyon
decision
of
this
court.
certiorari
was
granted
by
this
court
on
october
26,
1971.
the
first
problem
that
we
are
faced
with,
obviously
is
halcyon
against
haenn.
that
decision
decided
that
a
right
to
contribution
had
never
been
extended
in
maritime
noncollision
cases.
this
was
true
even
though
such
a
right
existed
in
collision
cases.
furthermore,
the
court
held
that
this
was
a
subject
for
congress
rather
than
for
judicial
decision.
mr.
devereux
milburn
at
present
time
your
honor,
i
believe
you
have
that
problem
before
you
on
the
certiorari
of
october
26,
1971.
mr.
devereux
milburn
i
would
say
it
would
have
an
impact
and
that
if
it
went
to
divide
the
damages
in
accordance
with
fall,
in
our
opinion
that
is
the
most
just
way
of
deciding
these
problems
and
we
would
have
changed
our
brief
and
we
would
change
our
argument,
but
we
didn't
think
we
could
change
the
entire
maritime
law,
well
in
one
day,
until
we
solve
that
case.
mr.
devereux
milburn
that's
because
clearly
because
it
was
traditional
and
also
because
the
two
dissenting
justices
in
halcyon
came
down
on
that
side
with
three
choices
or
four
choices.
mr.
devereux
milburn
that
is
right
sir.
mr.
devereux
milburn
well,
i
think
the
only
way
it
affects
it,
is
that
it
establishes,
(a)
unfortunately
the
negligence
of
atlantic
and
(b)
the
negligence
of
erie
and
the
fact
that
erie
was,
it's
negligence
was
a
substantial
factor
in
contributing
to
the
injuries
of
benazet.
well,
i
think
that,
that
is
important
when
we
get
into
the
active
passive
arguments
which
have
been
used
so
often
in
indemnity
and
in
other
cases
such
as
this.
mr.
devereux
milburn
it
will,
i
hope
your
honor,
if
halcyon
--
it
will
become
very
simple.
then
the
damages
will
be
apportioned
in
accordance
with
the
fall
enterprise
because
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
that
is
correct.
mr.
devereux
milburn
no
issue.
mr.
devereux
milburn
yes,
it
was.
mr.
devereux
milburn
no
you
could
not
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
they
would
have
to
be
a
remand
through
the
jury
finding.
mr.
devereux
milburn
if
you
do
it
proportionately
and
not
divided
them
--
if
you
divide
them
equally,
you
don't
need
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
equal
division?
that
is
the
usual
rule
in
admiralty
up
until
the
time
that
you
hear
the
(inaudible)
case.
the
congress
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
a
tort
case,
i
don't
understand
you.
mr.
devereux
milburn
an
injury
to
longshoremen
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
no,
an
injured
longshoremen.
mr.
devereux
milburn
because
he
was
on
the
wharf,
your
honor.
mr.
devereux
milburn
he
was
a
railroad
worker.
mr.
devereux
milburn
his
job
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
yes
sir.
mr.
devereux
milburn
yes
sir,
but
his
job
was.
mr.
devereux
milburn
and
he
was
employed
by
erie.
his
job
was
loading
the
barge.
mr.
devereux
milburn
a
longshoreman's
job,
yes
sir.
mr.
devereux
milburn
well,
jones
act
had
divided
damages
too,
sir.
mr.
devereux
milburn
erie.
mr.
devereux
milburn
that
is
correct,
there
wasn’t
a
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
no
sir,
no.
mr.
devereux
milburn
he
can
sue
a
shipowner
for
unseaworthiness.
mr.
devereux
milburn
we
wouldn't
need
negligence
on
unseaworthiness
because
our
support
without
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
not
in
our
case,
no
sir.
mr.
devereux
milburn
he
could
have
sure
the
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
i
don't
know
the
case
that
says
he
could
have
sued
the
shipowner
on
negligence,
but
he
could
have
sued
the
shipowner
for
unseaworthiness
because
as
soon
as
the
sign
of
the
negligence
without
fault.
mr.
devereux
milburn
yes
sir.
mr.
devereux
milburn
yes
sir.
mr.
devereux
milburn
that's
right.
mr.
devereux
milburn
yes
sir.
now,
if
i
could
spend
a
very
few
seconds
on
lack
of
congressional
activity,
we
didn't
have
it,
there
isn't
any.
two
decades
have
passed
since
the
halcyon
decision.
there
have
been
bills
in
congress
which
are
in
the
briefs
which
indicate
that
in
a
periphery
sort
of
a
way,
this
was
considered.
it
was
put
in
bills
but
it
was
never
reported
and
never
amounted
to
anything.
this
is
understandable
probably
because
of
the
decision
in
the
ryan
case
which
followed
the
halcyon
case
by
some
two
years
and
in
the
ryan
case
which
i
am
sure
your
honors
are
familiar
with,
an
indemnity
was
found
by
an
implied
warranty
on
the
part
of
the
stevedore
and
the
shipowner
recovered
from
the
stevedore.
this
relieved
the
shipowner
in
most
cases
of
his
absolute
liability
and
his
failure
to
be
able
to
contribute
--
to
obtain
contribution
from
the
stevedore
company.
now
i
think,
that
though
there
are
--
that
the
ryan
case
explains
that
i
think,
in
our
brief
you
will
find
a
footnote
which
indicates
that
far
from
coming
in
to
argue
about
halcyon,
they
came
in
to
say
that
the
whole
unseaworthiness
theory
was
wrong
and
a
bill
should
be
introduced
to
eliminate
that.
but,
we
do
not
have
any
congressional
action
in
the
last
two
decades
which
would
change
the
result
of
halcyon.
i
think
our
answer
to
that
is
contained
completely
in
our
quote
from
maragni
(ph)
which
appears
in
our
brief.
i
think,
that
in
the
interest
now
of
symmetry
and
the
maritime
law,
it
is
time
for
this
court
to
create
such
a
right,
to
recognize
a
right
of
contribution
in
cases
similar
to
this.
now
if
i
might
spend
just
a
second
on
the
history
of
halcyon
and
that
line
of
cases.
it
started,
because
i
am
sure
you
know
with
the
(inaudible)
case
and
then
through
sieracki
to
halcyon
and
from
halcyon
to
pope
&
talbot.
a
great
deal
was
made
of
the
sieracki
case,
i
would
like
to
just
point
out
one
difference
between
that
case
and
our
case.
there
was
a
great
deal
of
language
there
and
there
is
a
great
deal
of
language
in
all
these
cases
on
this
point
about
the
absolute
liability
of
the
shipowner
and
the
non-delegable
character
of
that
liability.
many
cases
go
off
on
that
line
that
we
cannot
let
him
pass
on
any
part
of
his
liability
because
if
he
does
so,
he
will
not
have
a
safe
ship.
he
will
not
have
the
incentive
to
have
a
safer
ship.well,
the
difference
is
that
we
are
not
the
ship
owner,
erie
is
the
shipowner.
we
don't
have
that,
we
don't
have
liability
without
fault.
erie
is
the
one
that
has
that
and
i
think
that
that
to
some
extent
distinguishes
sieracki
and
pope
&
talbot,
and
to
some
extent
halcyon.
now,
when
they
get
to
--
through
halcyon
and
pope
&
talbot,
the
law
suddenly
takes
a
bend
to
the
right.
the
shipping
industry,
the
maritime
law
finds
the
halcyon
case
hard
to
stomach
and
instead
of
that
it
develops
the
ryan
theory
and
the
ryan
theory
came
two
years
later,
decided
by
mr.
justice
burton
who
had
dissented
in
halcyon.
the
ryan
case,
developed
a
theory
of
indemnity
and
said
that
the
stevedore
had
an
implied
warranty,
had
given
an
implied
warranty
for
workmen
like
service.
in
some
cases,
there
was
a
written
warranty
of
working
rights
service,
but
in
the
ryan
case,
it
was
an
implied
warranty
of
workmen
like
service.
from
ryan,
we
went
to
weyerhaeuser
against
mcquinn
(ph).
there,
the
indemnity
held
even
though
it
was
equipment
that
was
used
negligibly
by
the
stevedore
and
had
said
in
that
case,
this
court
said
in
that
case,
that
not
even
the
negligence
of
shipowner
would
defeat
this
claim
of
indemnity
against
the
stevedore.
that
was
the
case
that
also
said
that
the
active,
passive
concept
of
negligence
was
not
important
and
it
was
in
opposite
in
cases
such
as
that
we
have
here.
after
that,
we
have
the
fisser
case,
the
crumady
against
fisser,
where
even
their
equipment
that
was
thoroughly
in
use,
in
a
faulty
manner
by
the
stevedore
was
supplied
by
the
shipowner.
then
in
boudoin,
we
have
the
warranty
not
only
running
to
the
shipowner
but
it
went
to
the
consignee
of
the
cargo,
and
finally
in
ataya
(ph),
we
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
stevedore
was
liable
for
indemnity
even
though
he
had
not
been
negligent
himself.
the
next
case
which
came
along
and
which
really
is
where
we
are
at
present
moment
was
the
federal
maritime
against
isbrandtsen,
which
suddenly
showed
the
opposite
side
of
the
coin.
this
case
suddenly
said,
that
the
shipowner
might
owe
some
duties
itself.
they
did
owe
a
duty
to
the
stevedore.
in
that
case,
where
they
said,
all
the
duty
to
the
stevedore
and
it's
last
sentence
said
that
it
did
not
judge
at
that
time,
between
the
liability
of
the
stevedore
for
indemnity
and
the
negligence
of
the
shipowner
for
violation
of
his
duty
to
the
stevedore
and
it
left
it
at
that.
now
the
isbrandtsen
case
pointed
out
that
there
was
no
quid
pro
quo
running
between
these
two
people,
the
stevedore
and
the
shipowner.
there
is
a
quid
pro
quo
running
between
the
stevedore
and
his
employee
and
that
is
contained
in
the
longshoremen's
act.
he
gave
up
and
he
accepted
the
stevedore
absolute
liability
and
in
return
for
that,
he
gave,
he
received
a
limitation
of
his
damages.
now,
that
isbrandtsen
leads
us
to
looking
for
a
possible
solution,
i
might
just
add
one
other
line
of
cases
running
out
of
halcyon
which
is
the
fifth
circuit,
the
horton
and
now
the
second
circuit
with
its
latest
moragne
case.
all
those
cases
interpret
halcyon
as
being
limited
towards
facts,
as
holding
that
there
is
only
--
no
right
to
contribution
when
one
of
the
parties
is
barred
--
his
limitations,
his
liabilities
is
limited
is
limited
by
statute.
now
we
have
maintained
and
said
throughout
in
our
brief
that
the
liability
of
erie
in
this
case
is
not
limited
by
statute
or
is
not
exclusively
set
by
the
statute.
as
i
stated
before
benazet
has
right
to
sue
erie
for
unseaworthiness
and
if
he
did
sue
on
this
--
based
on
the
yaka
and
the
jackson
against
lykes
cases,
if
he
did
sue
erie
and
was
successful,
it
could
recover
in
addition
to
its
payments
under
the
longshoremen's
act.
we
therefore
could
extend
the
cotton
and
watz
and
moragne
case
in
such
a
way
is
to
avoid
halcyon
and
say
that
halcyon
is
limited
to
its
facts
and
here
the
liability
is
not
limited
and
only
under
the
act,
but
there
was
also
the
unseaworthiness
liability.
on
the
other
hand
by
so
doing,
we
will
avoid
the
frontal
attack
on
halcyon
which
we
feel
is
so
necessary
at
this
time.
now
as
was
stated
in
the
ataya
case,
contribution
is
based
on
law
and
indemnity
is
based
on
a
contract
theory.
both
are
unjust.
i
don't
say
contribution
is
unjust
but
the
denial
of
the
right
of
contribution
and
indemnity
are
unjust
in
that
both
put
100%
of
the
liability
on
one
side
or
on
the
other,
unless
of
course
the
indemnity
is
set
by
a
written
contract.
now,
that
brings
me
to
a
interesting
case
which
is
annexed
to
applied
brief
as
an
appendix,
dole
against
dow
chemical.
that
case
was
decided
by
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
within
the
last
week
or
so,
came
out
with
in
the
last
week
or
so.
in
that
case
the
manufacturer
manufactured
an
insecticide
or
a
powder
of
aerosol
of
one
kind
or
another
and
the
user
sprayed
the
room
and
shortly
that
after
his
employee
walked
in
and
died
because
of
the
effects.
the
user
claimed
that,
there
wasn't
on
the
can
how
it
should
be
used,
the
manufacturer
said
it
was
on
the
can,
you
didn't
use
it
rightly,
you
should
have
aired
the
room.
judge
began
(ph)
in
that
case
threw
aside
all
considerations
of
active
and
passive
negligence
and
that
case
was
a
natural
for
active
and
passive
negligence
in
an
indemnity
case.
but
he
threw
that
aside
and
he
decided
that
he
was
going
to
fashion
a
new
remedy
and
that
remedy
was
going
to
be
decided
upon
where
did
the
fault
lie
and
if
the
fault
was
evenly
divided
or
unevenly
divided
in
either
case,
he
was
going
to
decide
where
the
fault
lay
and
at
what
percentage
and
at
what
proportion
and
in
that
way
distribute
it.
now,
he
talks
in
the
language
of
indemnity,
but
he
comes
out
with
a
result
of
the
contribution
and
quite
frequently
during
his
opinion,
he
certainly
stops
talking
about
indemnity
and
talks
about
contribution,
but
it
is
the
result
that
we
are
particularly
interested
in.
it
is
the
discarding
of
the
active-passive
theory
and
the
idea
of
sitting
down
and
looking
at
this
problem,
if
negligence
was
against
--
now
you
ought
to
pay
in
proportion
of
how
you
--
in
proportion
which
you
are
negligent.
and
we
recommend
the
consideration
of
that
decision
as
a
solution,
as
a
cutting
of
this
knot
between
indemnity
a
100%,
and
denial
of
contribution
a
100%
and
let
the
damages
for
wherever
this
court
will
decide
within
the
next
few
weeks,
either
equally
divide
it
if
it
is
a
maritime
or
in
some
other
way
depending
on
(inaudible)
case.
now,
one
thing
about
the
dole
case
that
i
would
emphasis
is,
at
the
end,
he
ends
up
with
a
tort
solution
and
this
is
a
tort
case
and
his
was
a
tort
case
and
you
ought
to
have
a
tort
decision
dividing
the
remedies
equally
or
unequally
in
accordance
with
fall
but
you
should
not
--
these
cases
should
not
really
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
contract
and
implied
warranties.
now,
the
next
problem
that
arises
is
the
longshore
and
harbor
workers
act
and
its
language
which
might
to
some
at
first
blush
indicate
that
it
was
exclusive
--
that
it
was
the
exclusive
liability
of
the
erie
railroad.
i
would
say,
that
there
are
three
reasons
why
--
not
reasons
but
three
reasons
why
this
was
not
necessarily
true.
it
was
decided
in
the
ryan
case
that
the
act
did
not
--
was
not
exclusive
and
in
weyerhaeuser
against
united
states
case,
it
was
decided
that
it
was
said
our
act,
the
longshore
act
is
virtually
identical
with
the
workmen's
compensation
act,
the
federal
employees'
compensation
act
which
is
under
consideration
there,
and
that
didn't
bar
what
we
are
asking
for
and
thirdly,
there
is
no
principle
of
court
that
we
are
saying
as
they
said
in
the
new
york
case
and
as
was
indicated
in
isbrandtsen
that
we
have
a
separable,
legal
entity
of
rights
here.
we
have
got
atlantic
against
erie,
erie
against
atlantic,
all
mr.
benazet
does
really
in
this
case
is
to
measure
the
damages
which
are
to
be
apportioned.
mr.
devereux
milburn
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
commence
this
rebuttal
period
by
just
reading
two
sentences
which
i
think
are
very
important
in
this
case,
and
they
come
from
the
questionnaire
presented
by
judge
cooper
to
the
jury.
mr.
devereux
milburn
page
62
mr.
justice.
mr.
devereux
milburn
question
6;
if
you
find
the
atlantic
coastline
railroad
is
liable,
was
the
erie
lackawanna
railroad
also
negative.
answer,
yes.
if
so,
was
such
negligence,
a
substantial
factor
in
bringing
about
plaintiff's
injury.
answer,
yes.
now
judge
cooper
in
his
opinion
also
found
that
erie
was
negative
--
pointed
out
the
jury
had
so
found
and
the
erie's
negligence
was
approximate
cause
as
was
atlantic's.
judge
cooper
found
not
that
there
was
no
intervening
cause
as
was
such
stated
yesterday,
but
that
there
was
no
superseding
cause
and
that
we
admit.
there
was
no
superseding
cause,
we
were
approximate
cause
as
was
erie.
now
we
seem
to
be
turning
up
here
as
the
bad
guys
in
this,
the
only
one's
who
were
negligent.
erie
had
solely
a
duty
to
inspect.
well,
i
might
call
your
honor's
attention
to
a
case
cited
in
our
petition
for
certiorari
on
page
6,
chicago
rock
islandrailroad
against
chicago
north
western
railroad
in
the
eighth
circuit
and
i
think
that
that
case
illustrates
pretty
clearly
that
the
primary
responsibility
for
an
unsafe
car,
lies
with
the
railroad
upon
whose
tracks,
the
unsafe
car
is
at
the
time
of
the
accident.
i
might
point
out
that
this
car
was
on
erie's
tracks
at
the
time
of
the
accident.
mr.
devereux
milburn
with
some
qualification
mr.
chief
justice
but
i
believe
in
the
rock
island
and
northwestern
case,
it
was
the
about
as
close
as
you
could
come.
the
tracks
intersected
at
right
angles.
there
was
a
circular
interchanged
track
in
between.
rock
island
left
it
on
the
interchange
and
northwestern
picked
it
up
and
the
court
indicated
that
northwestern
had
the
primary
responsibility
to
inspect
that
car
and
it
was
on
there
lines
and
they
have
the
primary
liability.
now
we
were
also
told
yesterday
that
this
car
was
never
in
(inaudible)
by
erie.
well,
if
it
had
been
in
their
shop
and
the
evidence
says
that
you
could
notice
this,
the
decay
and
the
fissure
from
the
ground,
if
the
car
had
been
in
their
shop,
we
wouldn't
have
had
the
accident
and
we
wouldn't
have
been
here
now
and
we
maintain
that
it
was
their
duty
and
their
duty
not
only
to
benazet,
but
also
their
duty
to
us
to
inspect
that
car
and
to
put
it
in
the
shop
and
to
fix
it
and
it
was
that
duty
to
us
that
they
have
violated
and
it
was
one
of
their
duties.
there
are
two
duties,
one
to
benazet
and
one
duty
to
us
and
they
violated
both
of
them.
now,
as
we've
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
erie
had
the
last
clear
chance
to
fix
this
car,
we
didn't,
we
hadn't
had
it
for
three
days.
there
is
no
way
before
benazet
was
here,
we
could've
fixed
that
car.
well,
assuming
we
know
where
it
was,
but
were
not
inspecting
it,
they
had
the
duty.
now
if
i
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
yes
sir,
and
i
believe
that's
why
we
were
held
negligent
by
the
jury.
to
sum
up,
may
i
say
that
erie
is
expecting
to
get
out
of
this
scot-free.
erie,
in
this
case,
the
ship
owner
with
liability
without
fault.
erie
who
is
negligent,
erie
who
had
the
last
chance,
erie
who
employed
benazet
and
erie
wants
to
get
out
with
no
money
and
13.07,
this
court
said
if
they
could
--
if
they
were
convinced
with
the
justice,
they
might
have
decided
it
the
other
way.
i
cannot
see
how
there
can
be
any
question,
well
the
justice
of
this
case
if
erie
gets
all
scot-free.
thank
you.
mr.
devereux
milburn
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
your
honors
please,
i
would
like
to
reserve
five
minutes
for
rebuttal
at
the
end
of
my
argument.
mr.
devereux
milburn
the
question
which
this
appeal
presents
to
the
court
is
whether
or
not
this
court
should
recognize
a
right
to
contribution
in
maritime
noncollision
cases.
an
obstacle
to
granting
such
a
right
is
halcyon
lines
against
haenn,
a
famous
case.
a
subsidiary
question
is
whether
contribution
by
the
erie
railroad
is
precluded
by
the
longshoremen
&
harbor
workers'
compensation
act.
an
alternative
is
should
the
court
of
appeals
have
applied
a
new
jersey
statue,
creating
a
right
of
contribution
by
supplementation.
the
factual
setting
in
which
these
questions
ought
to
be
decided
is
relatively
simple
and
can
be
briefly
stated.
an
action
was
commenced
in
may
of
1966
against
atlantic
by
a
plaintiff
benazet
for
injuries
he
sustained
on
july
30,
1964.
for
those
injuries,
erie
railroad
paid
him
compensation
under
the
act.
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
rested
on
diversity
of
the
citizenship.
a
box
car
belonging
to
atlantic,
but
on
erie's
tracks
and
having
been
in
erie's
possession
for
three
days,
rolled
down
the
erie's
tracks,
across
a
floating
bridge
and
on
to
a
car
float
which
was
floating.
benazet
climbed
of
the
back
of
the
box
car
to
adjust
the
brakes
and
while
turning
the
wheel,
the
brake
wheel,
the
foot
board
gave
away,
thus
throwing
his
weight
backwards
against
the
wheel
and
the
supports
of
the
wheel
gave
way
and
benazet
fell
to
the
deck
and
suffered
serious
injuries.
this
occurred
after
the
atlantic
box
car
had
been
through
many
railroads
as
stated
in
the
brief
for
erie
railroad.
erie,
although
it
had
a
duty
to
inspect
upon
receiving
the
car,
did
not
detect
the
decay
of
the
foot
board
or
the
fissure
in
the
supports
of
the
wheel
which
could
be
detected
from
the
ground.
the
case
was
--
as
was
set
aside,
the
case
was
tried
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
a
common
law
tort
and
a
maritime
law
was
not
thought
off
until
after
the
summation
by
both
counsel
and
just
prior
to
the
charge,
when
a
memorandum
was
submitted
that
this
thing,
that
the
box
car
was
on
it
was
float
and
not
attached
to
the
pier
and
not
attached
to
the
land
except
by
the
floating
bridge
and
therefore
maritime
law
applied.
counsel
were
given
from
5
'o
clock
that
evening
until
9
'o
clock
next
morning
to
readjust
their
thinking
and
suddenly
become
experts
in
maritime
law.
the
district
judge
gave
a
questionnaire
to
the
jurors.
the
jurors
found
that
atlantic
was
negligent.
the
jurors
found
that
erie
was
negligent
and
the
jurors
further
found
that
erie’s
negligence
was
a
substantial
factor
contributing
to
the
injuries
of
benazet.
the
judge,
judge
cooper
dismissed
atlantic's
third
party
claim
against
erie
on
the
ground
that
in
maritime
law,
no
right
of
contribution
existed
and
refused
supplementation
by
using
the
new
jersey
joint
tortfeasor's
contribution
act.
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed
while
finding
that
our
arguments
were
appealing,
nevertheless
stating
that
they
propound
by
the
halcyon
decision
of
this
court.
certiorari
was
granted
by
this
court
on
october
26,
1971.
the
first
problem
that
we
are
faced
with,
obviously
is
halcyon
against
haenn.
that
decision
decided
that
a
right
to
contribution
had
never
been
extended
in
maritime
noncollision
cases.
this
was
true
even
though
such
a
right
existed
in
collision
cases.
furthermore,
the
court
held
that
this
was
a
subject
for
congress
rather
than
for
judicial
decision.
mr.
devereux
milburn
at
present
time
your
honor,
i
believe
you
have
that
problem
before
you
on
the
certiorari
of
october
26,
1971.
mr.
devereux
milburn
i
would
say
it
would
have
an
impact
and
that
if
it
went
to
divide
the
damages
in
accordance
with
fall,
in
our
opinion
that
is
the
most
just
way
of
deciding
these
problems
and
we
would
have
changed
our
brief
and
we
would
change
our
argument,
but
we
didn't
think
we
could
change
the
entire
maritime
law,
well
in
one
day,
until
we
solve
that
case.
mr.
devereux
milburn
that's
because
clearly
because
it
was
traditional
and
also
because
the
two
dissenting
justices
in
halcyon
came
down
on
that
side
with
three
choices
or
four
choices.
mr.
devereux
milburn
that
is
right
sir.
mr.
devereux
milburn
well,
i
think
the
only
way
it
affects
it,
is
that
it
establishes,
(a)
unfortunately
the
negligence
of
atlantic
and
(b)
the
negligence
of
erie
and
the
fact
that
erie
was,
it's
negligence
was
a
substantial
factor
in
contributing
to
the
injuries
of
benazet.
well,
i
think
that,
that
is
important
when
we
get
into
the
active
passive
arguments
which
have
been
used
so
often
in
indemnity
and
in
other
cases
such
as
this.
mr.
devereux
milburn
it
will,
i
hope
your
honor,
if
halcyon
--
it
will
become
very
simple.
then
the
damages
will
be
apportioned
in
accordance
with
the
fall
enterprise
because
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
that
is
correct.
mr.
devereux
milburn
no
issue.
mr.
devereux
milburn
yes,
it
was.
mr.
devereux
milburn
no
you
could
not
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
they
would
have
to
be
a
remand
through
the
jury
finding.
mr.
devereux
milburn
if
you
do
it
proportionately
and
not
divided
them
--
if
you
divide
them
equally,
you
don't
need
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
equal
division?
that
is
the
usual
rule
in
admiralty
up
until
the
time
that
you
hear
the
(inaudible)
case.
the
congress
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
a
tort
case,
i
don't
understand
you.
mr.
devereux
milburn
an
injury
to
longshoremen
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
no,
an
injured
longshoremen.
mr.
devereux
milburn
because
he
was
on
the
wharf,
your
honor.
mr.
devereux
milburn
he
was
a
railroad
worker.
mr.
devereux
milburn
his
job
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
yes
sir.
mr.
devereux
milburn
yes
sir,
but
his
job
was.
mr.
devereux
milburn
and
he
was
employed
by
erie.
his
job
was
loading
the
barge.
mr.
devereux
milburn
a
longshoreman's
job,
yes
sir.
mr.
devereux
milburn
well,
jones
act
had
divided
damages
too,
sir.
mr.
devereux
milburn
erie.
mr.
devereux
milburn
that
is
correct,
there
wasn’t
a
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
no
sir,
no.
mr.
devereux
milburn
he
can
sue
a
shipowner
for
unseaworthiness.
mr.
devereux
milburn
we
wouldn't
need
negligence
on
unseaworthiness
because
our
support
without
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
not
in
our
case,
no
sir.
mr.
devereux
milburn
he
could
have
sure
the
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
i
don't
know
the
case
that
says
he
could
have
sued
the
shipowner
on
negligence,
but
he
could
have
sued
the
shipowner
for
unseaworthiness
because
as
soon
as
the
sign
of
the
negligence
without
fault.
mr.
devereux
milburn
yes
sir.
mr.
devereux
milburn
yes
sir.
mr.
devereux
milburn
that's
right.
mr.
devereux
milburn
yes
sir.
now,
if
i
could
spend
a
very
few
seconds
on
lack
of
congressional
activity,
we
didn't
have
it,
there
isn't
any.
two
decades
have
passed
since
the
halcyon
decision.
there
have
been
bills
in
congress
which
are
in
the
briefs
which
indicate
that
in
a
periphery
sort
of
a
way,
this
was
considered.
it
was
put
in
bills
but
it
was
never
reported
and
never
amounted
to
anything.
this
is
understandable
probably
because
of
the
decision
in
the
ryan
case
which
followed
the
halcyon
case
by
some
two
years
and
in
the
ryan
case
which
i
am
sure
your
honors
are
familiar
with,
an
indemnity
was
found
by
an
implied
warranty
on
the
part
of
the
stevedore
and
the
shipowner
recovered
from
the
stevedore.
this
relieved
the
shipowner
in
most
cases
of
his
absolute
liability
and
his
failure
to
be
able
to
contribute
--
to
obtain
contribution
from
the
stevedore
company.
now
i
think,
that
though
there
are
--
that
the
ryan
case
explains
that
i
think,
in
our
brief
you
will
find
a
footnote
which
indicates
that
far
from
coming
in
to
argue
about
halcyon,
they
came
in
to
say
that
the
whole
unseaworthiness
theory
was
wrong
and
a
bill
should
be
introduced
to
eliminate
that.
but,
we
do
not
have
any
congressional
action
in
the
last
two
decades
which
would
change
the
result
of
halcyon.
i
think
our
answer
to
that
is
contained
completely
in
our
quote
from
maragni
(ph)
which
appears
in
our
brief.
i
think,
that
in
the
interest
now
of
symmetry
and
the
maritime
law,
it
is
time
for
this
court
to
create
such
a
right,
to
recognize
a
right
of
contribution
in
cases
similar
to
this.
now
if
i
might
spend
just
a
second
on
the
history
of
halcyon
and
that
line
of
cases.
it
started,
because
i
am
sure
you
know
with
the
(inaudible)
case
and
then
through
sieracki
to
halcyon
and
from
halcyon
to
pope
&
talbot.
a
great
deal
was
made
of
the
sieracki
case,
i
would
like
to
just
point
out
one
difference
between
that
case
and
our
case.
there
was
a
great
deal
of
language
there
and
there
is
a
great
deal
of
language
in
all
these
cases
on
this
point
about
the
absolute
liability
of
the
shipowner
and
the
non-delegable
character
of
that
liability.
many
cases
go
off
on
that
line
that
we
cannot
let
him
pass
on
any
part
of
his
liability
because
if
he
does
so,
he
will
not
have
a
safe
ship.
he
will
not
have
the
incentive
to
have
a
safer
ship.well,
the
difference
is
that
we
are
not
the
ship
owner,
erie
is
the
shipowner.
we
don't
have
that,
we
don't
have
liability
without
fault.
erie
is
the
one
that
has
that
and
i
think
that
that
to
some
extent
distinguishes
sieracki
and
pope
&
talbot,
and
to
some
extent
halcyon.
now,
when
they
get
to
--
through
halcyon
and
pope
&
talbot,
the
law
suddenly
takes
a
bend
to
the
right.
the
shipping
industry,
the
maritime
law
finds
the
halcyon
case
hard
to
stomach
and
instead
of
that
it
develops
the
ryan
theory
and
the
ryan
theory
came
two
years
later,
decided
by
mr.
justice
burton
who
had
dissented
in
halcyon.
the
ryan
case,
developed
a
theory
of
indemnity
and
said
that
the
stevedore
had
an
implied
warranty,
had
given
an
implied
warranty
for
workmen
like
service.
in
some
cases,
there
was
a
written
warranty
of
working
rights
service,
but
in
the
ryan
case,
it
was
an
implied
warranty
of
workmen
like
service.
from
ryan,
we
went
to
weyerhaeuser
against
mcquinn
(ph).
there,
the
indemnity
held
even
though
it
was
equipment
that
was
used
negligibly
by
the
stevedore
and
had
said
in
that
case,
this
court
said
in
that
case,
that
not
even
the
negligence
of
shipowner
would
defeat
this
claim
of
indemnity
against
the
stevedore.
that
was
the
case
that
also
said
that
the
active,
passive
concept
of
negligence
was
not
important
and
it
was
in
opposite
in
cases
such
as
that
we
have
here.
after
that,
we
have
the
fisser
case,
the
crumady
against
fisser,
where
even
their
equipment
that
was
thoroughly
in
use,
in
a
faulty
manner
by
the
stevedore
was
supplied
by
the
shipowner.
then
in
boudoin,
we
have
the
warranty
not
only
running
to
the
shipowner
but
it
went
to
the
consignee
of
the
cargo,
and
finally
in
ataya
(ph),
we
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
stevedore
was
liable
for
indemnity
even
though
he
had
not
been
negligent
himself.
the
next
case
which
came
along
and
which
really
is
where
we
are
at
present
moment
was
the
federal
maritime
against
isbrandtsen,
which
suddenly
showed
the
opposite
side
of
the
coin.
this
case
suddenly
said,
that
the
shipowner
might
owe
some
duties
itself.
they
did
owe
a
duty
to
the
stevedore.
in
that
case,
where
they
said,
all
the
duty
to
the
stevedore
and
it's
last
sentence
said
that
it
did
not
judge
at
that
time,
between
the
liability
of
the
stevedore
for
indemnity
and
the
negligence
of
the
shipowner
for
violation
of
his
duty
to
the
stevedore
and
it
left
it
at
that.
now
the
isbrandtsen
case
pointed
out
that
there
was
no
quid
pro
quo
running
between
these
two
people,
the
stevedore
and
the
shipowner.
there
is
a
quid
pro
quo
running
between
the
stevedore
and
his
employee
and
that
is
contained
in
the
longshoremen's
act.
he
gave
up
and
he
accepted
the
stevedore
absolute
liability
and
in
return
for
that,
he
gave,
he
received
a
limitation
of
his
damages.
now,
that
isbrandtsen
leads
us
to
looking
for
a
possible
solution,
i
might
just
add
one
other
line
of
cases
running
out
of
halcyon
which
is
the
fifth
circuit,
the
horton
and
now
the
second
circuit
with
its
latest
moragne
case.
all
those
cases
interpret
halcyon
as
being
limited
towards
facts,
as
holding
that
there
is
only
--
no
right
to
contribution
when
one
of
the
parties
is
barred
--
his
limitations,
his
liabilities
is
limited
is
limited
by
statute.
now
we
have
maintained
and
said
throughout
in
our
brief
that
the
liability
of
erie
in
this
case
is
not
limited
by
statute
or
is
not
exclusively
set
by
the
statute.
as
i
stated
before
benazet
has
right
to
sue
erie
for
unseaworthiness
and
if
he
did
sue
on
this
--
based
on
the
yaka
and
the
jackson
against
lykes
cases,
if
he
did
sue
erie
and
was
successful,
it
could
recover
in
addition
to
its
payments
under
the
longshoremen's
act.
we
therefore
could
extend
the
cotton
and
watz
and
moragne
case
in
such
a
way
is
to
avoid
halcyon
and
say
that
halcyon
is
limited
to
its
facts
and
here
the
liability
is
not
limited
and
only
under
the
act,
but
there
was
also
the
unseaworthiness
liability.
on
the
other
hand
by
so
doing,
we
will
avoid
the
frontal
attack
on
halcyon
which
we
feel
is
so
necessary
at
this
time.
now
as
was
stated
in
the
ataya
case,
contribution
is
based
on
law
and
indemnity
is
based
on
a
contract
theory.
both
are
unjust.
i
don't
say
contribution
is
unjust
but
the
denial
of
the
right
of
contribution
and
indemnity
are
unjust
in
that
both
put
100%
of
the
liability
on
one
side
or
on
the
other,
unless
of
course
the
indemnity
is
set
by
a
written
contract.
now,
that
brings
me
to
a
interesting
case
which
is
annexed
to
applied
brief
as
an
appendix,
dole
against
dow
chemical.
that
case
was
decided
by
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
within
the
last
week
or
so,
came
out
with
in
the
last
week
or
so.
in
that
case
the
manufacturer
manufactured
an
insecticide
or
a
powder
of
aerosol
of
one
kind
or
another
and
the
user
sprayed
the
room
and
shortly
that
after
his
employee
walked
in
and
died
because
of
the
effects.
the
user
claimed
that,
there
wasn't
on
the
can
how
it
should
be
used,
the
manufacturer
said
it
was
on
the
can,
you
didn't
use
it
rightly,
you
should
have
aired
the
room.
judge
began
(ph)
in
that
case
threw
aside
all
considerations
of
active
and
passive
negligence
and
that
case
was
a
natural
for
active
and
passive
negligence
in
an
indemnity
case.
but
he
threw
that
aside
and
he
decided
that
he
was
going
to
fashion
a
new
remedy
and
that
remedy
was
going
to
be
decided
upon
where
did
the
fault
lie
and
if
the
fault
was
evenly
divided
or
unevenly
divided
in
either
case,
he
was
going
to
decide
where
the
fault
lay
and
at
what
percentage
and
at
what
proportion
and
in
that
way
distribute
it.
now,
he
talks
in
the
language
of
indemnity,
but
he
comes
out
with
a
result
of
the
contribution
and
quite
frequently
during
his
opinion,
he
certainly
stops
talking
about
indemnity
and
talks
about
contribution,
but
it
is
the
result
that
we
are
particularly
interested
in.
it
is
the
discarding
of
the
active-passive
theory
and
the
idea
of
sitting
down
and
looking
at
this
problem,
if
negligence
was
against
--
now
you
ought
to
pay
in
proportion
of
how
you
--
in
proportion
which
you
are
negligent.
and
we
recommend
the
consideration
of
that
decision
as
a
solution,
as
a
cutting
of
this
knot
between
indemnity
a
100%,
and
denial
of
contribution
a
100%
and
let
the
damages
for
wherever
this
court
will
decide
within
the
next
few
weeks,
either
equally
divide
it
if
it
is
a
maritime
or
in
some
other
way
depending
on
(inaudible)
case.
now,
one
thing
about
the
dole
case
that
i
would
emphasis
is,
at
the
end,
he
ends
up
with
a
tort
solution
and
this
is
a
tort
case
and
his
was
a
tort
case
and
you
ought
to
have
a
tort
decision
dividing
the
remedies
equally
or
unequally
in
accordance
with
fall
but
you
should
not
--
these
cases
should
not
really
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
contract
and
implied
warranties.
now,
the
next
problem
that
arises
is
the
longshore
and
harbor
workers
act
and
its
language
which
might
to
some
at
first
blush
indicate
that
it
was
exclusive
--
that
it
was
the
exclusive
liability
of
the
erie
railroad.
i
would
say,
that
there
are
three
reasons
why
--
not
reasons
but
three
reasons
why
this
was
not
necessarily
true.
it
was
decided
in
the
ryan
case
that
the
act
did
not
--
was
not
exclusive
and
in
weyerhaeuser
against
united
states
case,
it
was
decided
that
it
was
said
our
act,
the
longshore
act
is
virtually
identical
with
the
workmen's
compensation
act,
the
federal
employees'
compensation
act
which
is
under
consideration
there,
and
that
didn't
bar
what
we
are
asking
for
and
thirdly,
there
is
no
principle
of
court
that
we
are
saying
as
they
said
in
the
new
york
case
and
as
was
indicated
in
isbrandtsen
that
we
have
a
separable,
legal
entity
of
rights
here.
we
have
got
atlantic
against
erie,
erie
against
atlantic,
all
mr.
benazet
does
really
in
this
case
is
to
measure
the
damages
which
are
to
be
apportioned.
mr.
devereux
milburn
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
commence
this
rebuttal
period
by
just
reading
two
sentences
which
i
think
are
very
important
in
this
case,
and
they
come
from
the
questionnaire
presented
by
judge
cooper
to
the
jury.
mr.
devereux
milburn
page
62
mr.
justice.
mr.
devereux
milburn
question
6;
if
you
find
the
atlantic
coastline
railroad
is
liable,
was
the
erie
lackawanna
railroad
also
negative.
answer,
yes.
if
so,
was
such
negligence,
a
substantial
factor
in
bringing
about
plaintiff's
injury.
answer,
yes.
now
judge
cooper
in
his
opinion
also
found
that
erie
was
negative
--
pointed
out
the
jury
had
so
found
and
the
erie's
negligence
was
approximate
cause
as
was
atlantic's.
judge
cooper
found
not
that
there
was
no
intervening
cause
as
was
such
stated
yesterday,
but
that
there
was
no
superseding
cause
and
that
we
admit.
there
was
no
superseding
cause,
we
were
approximate
cause
as
was
erie.
now
we
seem
to
be
turning
up
here
as
the
bad
guys
in
this,
the
only
one's
who
were
negligent.
erie
had
solely
a
duty
to
inspect.
well,
i
might
call
your
honor's
attention
to
a
case
cited
in
our
petition
for
certiorari
on
page
6,
chicago
rock
islandrailroad
against
chicago
north
western
railroad
in
the
eighth
circuit
and
i
think
that
that
case
illustrates
pretty
clearly
that
the
primary
responsibility
for
an
unsafe
car,
lies
with
the
railroad
upon
whose
tracks,
the
unsafe
car
is
at
the
time
of
the
accident.
i
might
point
out
that
this
car
was
on
erie's
tracks
at
the
time
of
the
accident.
mr.
devereux
milburn
with
some
qualification
mr.
chief
justice
but
i
believe
in
the
rock
island
and
northwestern
case,
it
was
the
about
as
close
as
you
could
come.
the
tracks
intersected
at
right
angles.
there
was
a
circular
interchanged
track
in
between.
rock
island
left
it
on
the
interchange
and
northwestern
picked
it
up
and
the
court
indicated
that
northwestern
had
the
primary
responsibility
to
inspect
that
car
and
it
was
on
there
lines
and
they
have
the
primary
liability.
now
we
were
also
told
yesterday
that
this
car
was
never
in
(inaudible)
by
erie.
well,
if
it
had
been
in
their
shop
and
the
evidence
says
that
you
could
notice
this,
the
decay
and
the
fissure
from
the
ground,
if
the
car
had
been
in
their
shop,
we
wouldn't
have
had
the
accident
and
we
wouldn't
have
been
here
now
and
we
maintain
that
it
was
their
duty
and
their
duty
not
only
to
benazet,
but
also
their
duty
to
us
to
inspect
that
car
and
to
put
it
in
the
shop
and
to
fix
it
and
it
was
that
duty
to
us
that
they
have
violated
and
it
was
one
of
their
duties.
there
are
two
duties,
one
to
benazet
and
one
duty
to
us
and
they
violated
both
of
them.
now,
as
we've
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
erie
had
the
last
clear
chance
to
fix
this
car,
we
didn't,
we
hadn't
had
it
for
three
days.
there
is
no
way
before
benazet
was
here,
we
could've
fixed
that
car.
well,
assuming
we
know
where
it
was,
but
were
not
inspecting
it,
they
had
the
duty.
now
if
i
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
yes
sir,
and
i
believe
that's
why
we
were
held
negligent
by
the
jury.
to
sum
up,
may
i
say
that
erie
is
expecting
to
get
out
of
this
scot-free.
erie,
in
this
case,
the
ship
owner
with
liability
without
fault.
erie
who
is
negligent,
erie
who
had
the
last
chance,
erie
who
employed
benazet
and
erie
wants
to
get
out
with
no
money
and
13.07,
this
court
said
if
they
could
--
if
they
were
convinced
with
the
justice,
they
might
have
decided
it
the
other
way.
i
cannot
see
how
there
can
be
any
question,
well
the
justice
of
this
case
if
erie
gets
all
scot-free.
thank
you.
