mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
barrett
prettyman
and
i
represent
the
respondent
the
erie
lackawanna
railway
in
this
case.
i
think
there
is
something
superficially
appealing
about
the
proposition
advanced
by
petitioner
here.
we
have
two
people
at
fault
plus
petitioner,
make
them
divide
the
damages
which
are
due
to
injured
party.
well,
it's
not
so
simple
and
i
think
once
we
will
get
into
it,
i
will
show
that
it's
not
so
appealing
either.
let's
look
first
to
see
how
the
rule
would
operate
within
the
specific
facts
of
this
case
and
then
let's
see
how
they
would
operate
generally.
there
were
two
serious
defects
in
this
railroad
car
which
was
owned
by
atlantic
and
both
of
these
defects
were
at
least
two
years
old.
during
those
two
years,
this
boxcar
had
been
in
the
possession
of
49
different
railroads.
it
had
been
in
the
possession
of
7
railroads
as
often
or
more
often
than
it
had
been
in
the
erie's
possession.
it
had
been
in
atlantic's
own
possession
eight
times,
twice
as
many
as
it
had
been
in
erie's.
more
importantly,
it
had
been
in
atlantic's
repair
shop
for
other
repairs,
at
least
four
times
during
this
period
and
there
were
three
additional
inspection
reports
by
atlantic,
one
of
them
within
seven
weeks
of
this
accident.
it
had
never
been
in
erie's
repair
shop.
now,
the
test
--
the
relevance
of
that
is
this.
the
testimony
shows
that
the
owning
railroad
has
a
very
special
duty
in
regard
to
its
own
cars.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
three
days.
the
only
railroad
when
it
has
its
car,
now
this
is
not
just
in
the
repair
shop,
but
when
it
gets
hold
of
its
own
car,
it
looks
for
cardable
(ph)
damage,
damage
which
was
done
by
others
and
should
have
been
repaired
by
others,
it
wasn't.
it
looks
for
excessive
wear
and
tries
to
anticipate
excessive
wear.
it
looks
also
at
empty
cars
and
this
is
important
because
in
this
case
for
example,
the
car
was
full.
we
couldn't
have
looked
inside
and
while
the
particular
defect
happened
to
be
outside,
it
indicates
the
only
railroad
has
more
of
a
chance
to
review
the
damage
to
a
car
and
moreover,
once
the
car
goes
into
the
repair
shop,
it
gets
a
complete
inspection
supposedly
from
top
to
bottom.
thus
while
the
normal
inspection
of
a
braking
system
which
is
done
by
a
car
into
its
possession,
the
car
happens
to
fall,
is
a
two
minute
examination,
normally
walking
around
the
car
and
inspecting
things
on
sight.
the
owning
car
has
a
special
duty
to
look
at
its
own
cars
and
particularly
when
it's
in
his
own
repair
shop
and
remember
this
car
was
in
atlantic's
own
repair
shop
four
times
during
this
two-year
period.
it
was
pure
happenstance,
that
this
accident
happened
while
the
car
happened
to
be
in
erie's
possession,
rather
than
somebody
else's,
one
of
these
48
other
railroads.
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
the
car
float
or
a
car
barge
which
was
what
erie,
erie
owned
here,
nothing
wrong
with
that.
there
is
no
evidence
that
mr.
benezet,
who
was
erie's
employee
was
negligent,
or
contributorily
negligent,
in
fact,
the
jury
said
no
he
wasn't.
there
was
no
evidence
that
any
other
erie
employee
was
in
anyway
negligent
either.
this
accident
could
as
easily
have
happened
on
any
other
person's
properties
as
erie's.
following
the
accident
and
here
is
rather
unique
point
going
to
your
point
mr.
justice
white,
following
the
accident,
erie
promptly
paid
mr.
benazet
over
$11,000
under
the
longshoremen
&
harbor
workers'
act.
and
i
think
one
of
the
interesting
facts
here
is
that
you
have
a
man,
who
was
paid
under
the
longshoremen's
act,
treated
as
a
longshoremen
and
yet
if
he
is
a
ship
owner,
why
isn't
he
a
crewman
and
if
i
may
very
respectfully
suggest
that
this
is
one
of
a
number
of
reasons
why,
my
own
view
is
that
this
is
quite
an
inappropriate
case
to
decide
this
far-reaching
question
of
maritime
law
because
you
do
have
this
confusion
between
things
like
the
safety
appliance
act
and
the
longshoremen's
act
and
so
forth,
in
this
particular
rather
peculiar
incident
where
you
have
railroad
car
sitting
on
a
car
bridge.
maritime
law
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
and
which
is
precise
the
end-point.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i
might
say
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no
sir,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
both
parties
agree
that
maritime
law
applies,
but
you
do
have
these
rather
peculiar
facts
over
and
above
your
normal
maritime
time
situation,
including
trying
to
figure
out
which
party
is
equal
to
the
stevedoring
company
and
which
party
is
equal
to
the
shipowners.
now
i
want
to
emphasize
that
in
paying
under
the
longshoremen's
act,
erie
had
no
choice.
this
was
an
absolute
duty
and
without
relation
before,
no
normal
defenses
applied,
such
as
the
fellow-servant
or
assumption
or
as
a
contributory
negligence.
now,
we
had
to
pay
that
money
without
regard
to
anything.
we
had
to
pay
it
and
we
paid
it
and
that
money
has
been
paid.
now,
those
are
the
facts
against
which,
we
approach
the
law
in
this
case.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
correct,
correct.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
and
it
was
the
longshoremen,
that's
correct.
now,
to
turn
to
the
law,
there
was
no
contribution
as
you
know,
in
common
law
and
then
the
courts
fashioned
an
exception
in
collision
cases.
what
halcyon
did
really,
was
to
extend,
was
to
refuse
to
extend
this
particular
exception
to
noncollision
cases.
why?
well
i
think
it
did
so
for
a
very
good
reason.
congress
had
repeatedly
legislated
in
this
field.
harbor
workers'
act,
harbor
act,
jones
act,
public
vessels
act,
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
extension
of
admiralty
jurisdiction
act,
limited
liability
act
and
yet
it
had
repeatedly
refused
to
provide
for
contribution.
if
there
really
was
a
need
for
contribution,
said
this
court
in
halcyon.
let
congress
provide
for
it.
congress
is
better
suited
to
say,
not
only
whether
contribution
ought
to
be
provided,
but
also
if
so,
what
measure
of
contribution
should
be
provided,
that
is
equally
divided,
proportionate
or
as
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
halcyon,
limited
by
the
amount
of
compensation,
which
the
employer
would
have
paid,
if
in
that
case,
he
had
paid
it.
the
court
pointed
out
that
there
are
awful
lot
of
people
interested
in
these
admiralty
matters
and
they
could
present
their
diversion
views
to
congress
and
these
views
could
be
reconciled.
now
that
was
20
years
ago.
congress
has
refused
to
change
the
halcyon
rule.
where
are
all
those
people
who
were
so
quick
to
find
maritime
abusive,
the
insurance
companies,
maritime
administration,
interior,
treasury,
justice,
commerce
department.
insurance
companies
as
i
said,
shipping
and
stevedoring
companies
union.
they
have
not
come
forward
to
complain
about
the
halcyon
rule.
it
is
true,
as
we
stress
that
congress
has
introduced
bills
which
we
think
would
have
the
effect
of
changing
halcyon,
but
the
interesting
thing
about
it
is
that
the
reports
on
those
bills
not
only
indicate
that
congress
didn't
have
in
mind
changing
halcyon,
but
more
importantly,
none
of
those
bills
have
even
gone
out
of
committee.
congress
is
satisfied
with
the
halcyon
rule
as
established
by
this
court.
now
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
was
informed
several
days
ago
that
on
may
2,
s525,
which
was
introduced
on
behalf
of
the
administration
will
have
hearings
in
the
congress
and
with
the
chief
justice's
permission,
i
would
like
to
submit
copies.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
may,
of
that
bill
to
the
clerk,
copies,
i
have
given
copies
today
to
my
opponent.
that
bill
would
make
a
compensation
the
exclusive
remedy
by
anyone
against
any
employer
and
this
even
would
include
indemnity.
secretary
of
labor
as
i
understand
would
testify
first
on
may
2.
so
this
is
hardly
a
dead
issue
in
congress.
this
issue,
which
this
court
said
in
halcyon
was
peculiarly
one
for
the
congress,
is
actively
under
consideration.
i
would
next
like
to
point
out
that
even
if
halcyon
were
restrictive
in
some
way,
there
would
be
no
contribution
here.
in
halcyon
no
compensation
was
paid.
the
injured
worker
sued
the
shipowner,
which
impleaded
the
employer
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
employer
was
liable
in
contribution
only
for
the
amount
it
would
have
paid
in
compensation,
if
the
employee
had
elected
to
sue
for
compensation,
but
in
this
case,
erie
has
already
paid
compensation.
so
even
if
the
halcyon
rule
is
restricted
back
to
the
view
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
that
case,
erie
still
owes
nothing
here.
secondly,
in
halcyon,
the
employer
was
the
real
party
at
fault,
not
the
shipowner.
the
jury
found
in
that
case
that
the
employer
was
75%
negligent
and
here
of
course
the
situation
is
reversed.
so
if
the
court
adopted
a
rule
of
contribution,
which
was
designed
to
make
sure
that
the
chief
wrongdoer
will
not
be
immune
from
all
liability,
which
really
happened
in
halcyon,
that
purpose
would
not
be
served
by
contribution
in
this
case.
but
in
any
event
we
claim
that
halcyon
shouldn’t
be
cut
back,
much
less
to
overruled.
barring
contribution
is
entirely
consistent
with
established
law.
unlike
indemnity,
contribution
is
based
on
joint
liability
as
joint
tortfeasors
to
a
common
injured
party
resulting
from
a
single
tort.
this
court
has
made
that
distinction
many
times.
there
is
no
such
joint
liability
here.
erie’s
obligation
without
regard
to
fault
to
this
injured
party
was
to
paying
compensation
under
the
act,
which
it
did.
mr.
benazet,
the
injured
employee
could
not
have
sued
erie
for
negligence.
with
all
due
respect,
mr.
justice
stewart
indicated
a
minute
ago,
that
the
court
had
established
that
anyone
could
sue
for
negligence,
that
is
accurate
with
a
single
exception
[attempt
to
laughter].
here
the
longshoremen
cannot
sue
his
employer
for
negligence.
the
furtherest
the
court
is
gone
in
the
yaka
and
lykes
brothers
case
is
to
say
that
he
can
sue
for
unseaworthiness
if
the
employer
is
also
the
owner
of
the
vessel
and
the
employer
is
solely
responsible.
but
there
is
a
large
difference
between
suing
for
unseaworthiness
and
a
suing
for
negligence.
on
negligence,
we
are
absolutely
protected
by
the
specific
words
of
this
act.
the
act
could
hardly
be
clear
in
regard
to
that.
therefore,
contribution
is
totally
inapplicable
here.
now
as
to
the
equities
of
this
situation,
a
strongly
favor
of
erie
and
i
would
like
to
point
--.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes
sir
and
i
am
going
to
submit
that
to
the
clerk
and
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
there
is
a
committee
hearing
set
for
may
2.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
the
thrust
of
the
bill
would
provide
that
no
one
can
recover
against
the
employer
who
has
paid
compensation
at
all
that
is
either
in
contribution
or
indemnity,
it
doesn’t
use
those
words,
but
it
in
effect,
makes
compensation
the
exclusive
remedy,
would
affect
even
this
court’s
indemnity
cases
really.
because
it
would
--
what
it
would
really
do
is
to
make
explicitly
clear
that
the
act
means
what
a
lot
of
us
had
assumed
[attempt
to
laughter]
that
meant
originally
and
that
was
that
when
you
pay
compensation,
that's
it.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes
sir.
[attempt
to
laughter]
now
the
same
argument,
precisely
the
same
argument
that
atlantic
is
making
here
in
terms
of
the
equities,
that
was
made
by
the
shipowner
in
pope
&
talbot
v.
hawn.
i
would
like
you
to
refer
very
specifically
to
that
case
because
in
that
case
here’s
what
the
shipowner
argued.
he
said
to
allow
the
employee
to
get
full
recovery
and
then
to
pay
over
to
his
employer,
what
he
had
received
in
contribute
--
in
that
compensation,
would
reward
the
employer
who
had
also
been
negligent,
that
was
precisely
the
argument
that
he
made.
this
court
said
no,
the
act
intends
that
employers
who
are
absolutely
liable
to
employees
for
compensation
being
protected.
therefore
if
the
court
overrules
halcyon,
it's
also
going
to
have
to
rule
this
portion
of
hawn
as
well.
moreover,
it’s
simply
not
fair
to
impose
contribution
in
this
case
for
this
reason.
here,
erie
and
atlanta
of
course
happen
both
to
be
parties,
but
in
another
cases,
where
the
employer
recovers
against
the
third-party,
that
third-party
can
turn
around
and
sue
the
employer
later
for
contribution,
doesn’t
have
to
be
on
the
same
suit
and
when
it
does,
the
employer
is
not
allowed
many
of
the
normal
defenses,
including
statute
limitations.
the
burden
in
these
cases,
we
submit,
should
fall
on
the
responsible
party.
there’s
no
question
here
as
judge
cooper
found
that
there
was
no
intervening
cause
between
the
negligence
of
this
boxcar’s
owner
and
the
accident.
more
importantly,
the
burden
and
this
is
something
that's
been
developed
in
your
recent
cases,
the
burden
should
fall
on
the
party
best
able
to
prevent
the
accident.
this
theme
runs
through
so
many
of
your
recent
opinions.
isn’t
that
what
we’re
really
trying
to
do
here.
we're
going
to
talk
about
the
acts
of
equity,
trying
to
prevent
the
accident
itself.
if
atlantic
can
get
contribution
from
erie,
when
erie's
only
fault,
only
fault
was
a
failure
to
inspect.
that's
what
the
pleading
even
said
on
behalf
of
atlantic,
that’s
all
we
were
ever
charged
with,
was
a
failure
to
inspect.
i
see
no
reason
why
we
couldn’t
bring
in
the
other
railroads
as
well,
rather
atlantic
could
bring
in
the
other
railroad
as
well,
who
had
had
this
car
in
their
possession
and
further
dilute
its
responsibility.
but
even
if
it
splits
only
with
us,
the
net
effect
is
to
give
comfort
to
this
one
party
best
able
to
cure
the
defects
in
this
boxcar
and
that's
its
owner.
if
you
gave
contribution
in
this
case,
you
would
be
saying
that
atlantic
doesn’t
owe
a
$100,000
of
this
judgment,
even
though
for
two
years
it
allowed
its
own
boxcar
to
stay
in
this
condition
and
even
though
it
had
this
boxcar
in
its
possession
8
times
in
its
own
shop,
four
times,
and
never
could
detected
this
condition
in
its
own
boxcars.
now
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
you
in
the
light
of
the
rather
simplistic
argument
that
you
should
simply
allow
contribution
to
some
of
the
difficulties
and
a
few
other
things
that
you
will
have
to
face
if
you
say
that
it
is
applicable
to
this
case.
first,
if
you
decide
that
contribution
is
not
absolutely
barred
as
a
kind
of
general
proposition,
then
you’re
going
to
have
to
face
the
question
that
would
not
have
to
be
decided
in
halcyon
and
that
is
does
the
harbor
workers'
act
bar
contribution
where
the
employer
has
paid
compensation?
again,
i
can
only
say,
i
am
not
going
to
read
it
to
you,
you’re
familiar
with
it,
the
language
is
absolutely
clear
and
no
case
i
emphasize
by
this
court
is
held
to
the
contrary.
secondly,
if
for
some
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
address
myself
and
that
why
you
acknowledge
in
that
respect.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes.
in
the
yaka
and
lykes
brothers,
with
right
respect
i
suggest
that
court
didn’t
go
that
far.
what
it
said
was
that
the
longshoremen
could
sue
for
unseaworthiness,
but
only
in
the
situation
where
the
employer
was
also
the
shipowner
and
was
solely
responsible.
in
both
those
cases,
the
shipowner
was
solely
responsible
of
the
act.
it
did
not
address
itself
to
the
negligence
question
and
neither
did
the
(inaudible)
case
which
involved
the
invitee.
i
suggest
that
the
court
has
never
held
that
--
against
the
language
of
the
act,
that
you
can
sue
for
negligence
which
is
an
entirely
different
thing.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
that's
right,
really.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yeah,
yes.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
that's
quite--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
because
in
the
shipowner
situation,
you
really
--
you
have
a
non-delegable
duty
or
as
the
owner
of
the
ship
in
regard
to
unseaworthiness,
but
you
can
in
turn,
turn
around
and
get
indemnity
by
bringing
in
the
real
party
in
interest.
now
in
this
case,
you
are
suing
directly
for
negligence
presumably,
the
party
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
as
a
shipowner,
that's
right,
which
you
see
has
a
peculiar
proposition
here
as
that
you
have
got
a
longshoreman
who
is
also
[attempt
to
laughter]
a
seaman,
in
the
sense
that
he
is
the
employee
of
the
--
i
also
would
like
to
point
out
that
in
the
yaka
and
lykes
brothers,
no
rights
were
established
in
third-parties
at
all.
this
related
entirely
to
the
suit
directly
between
the
longshoreman
and
his
employer.
no
rights
and
third-parties
were
established.
so
that
we
have
the
additional
distinction,
not
only
was
it
a
suit
for
unseaworthiness,
not
only
was
their
sole
responsibility,
but
here,
we're
really
talking
about
even
if
you
have
the
suit,
even
if
you
allow
the
suit
for
negligence
on
some
theoretical
ground,
aren't
you
then
face
to
face
with
the
language
of
the
statute,
that
is
despite
some
theoretical
right
to
sue
when
the
statute
says,
that
compensation
shall
be
the
sole
remedy
against
the
employer,
aren't
you
face
to
face
with
the
statute
--
?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well
the
longshoremen's
act
your
honor
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i'm
sorry,
but
i
respectfully
disagree
with
that.
the
language
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
the
language
your
honor,
let
me
just
find
the
language
here.
can
i
have
that
--?
the
language
says,
“the
liability
of
an
employer
prescribed
in
section
904,
shall
be
exclusive
and
in
place
of
all
other
liability
of
such
employer
to
the
employee,
his
legal
representatives,
husband
or
wife,
parents,
dependents,
next
of
kin
and
anyone
otherwise
entitled
to
recover
damages
from
such
employer
at
law
or
an
admiralty
on
account
of
such
injury
or
death.”
now
what
could
be
clear
than
that.
if
you
allow
contribution
after
mr.
benazet
has
recovered
for
negligence
against
atlantic,
if
you
allow
contribution,
you're
allowing
it
not
on
an
indemnity
theory,
that
to
somehow
there
is
--
something
owing
as
between
erie
and
atlantic,
because
there
isn't.
you
are
allowing
it
because
of
the
common
tortfeasor
status
to
mr.
benazet.
it
is
only
through
his
recovery
against
atlantic
that
somehow
we
would
have
to
owe
atlantic
something.
this
is
not
indemnity,
atlantic
specifically
said
in
this
suit
that
we
did
not
owe
them
for
indemnity.
they
are
not
saying
we
warranted
anything
or
we
owe
them
some
duty.
they're
saying
that
because
we
have
to
pay
mr.
benazet,
because
we
are
negligent
to
mr.
benazet,
you
as
a
joint
tortfeasor
owe
us
compensation.
the
statute
specifically
says
that
our
liability
should
be
exclusive
not
only
to
him,
but
to
anyone
otherwise
entitled
to
recover
damage
on
account
of
injury.
i
just
can't
imagine
how
language
could
be
more
specific
than
that.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
you
mean
that
--
not
his
employer,
sued?
yes,
certainly.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
he
did
sue
somebody
else.
he
sued
atlantic,
which
was
not
the
shipowner
and
he
did
recover.
and
now
the
shipowner
--
now
the
non-shipowner
so
to
speak,
the
third-party,
normally
let's
say
the
stevedoring
company,
is
attempting
not
to
get
indemnity
from
us,
because
of
something
that
we
owe
directly
to
them.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
they're
saying
because
of
the
common
liability
as
joint
tortfeasors
to
mr.
benazet,
and
that's
precisely
what
the
act
says
you
can't
do.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
exactly
your
honor.
we
are
not
a
joint
tortfeasor,
solely
because
of
the
kind
of
idea
that
even
if
you
allowed
contribution
here,
we
are
going
to
get
indemnity
from
them
because
that's
precisely
what
you
allow
in
these
cases.
do
you
want
me
to
continue
your
honor?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
alright,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
was
about
to
start
something
new
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
i
was
naming
some
of
the
problems
that
would
face
the
court,
if
contribution
were
now
to
be
allowed
as
a
general
proposition
and
i
was
pointing
out
that
the
first
problem
of
course
would
be
the
harbor
workers
act
and
i
was
saying
that
the
erie
and
atlantic
are
not
joint
tortfeasors
owing
a
common
duty
in
tort
to
benazet,
the
injured
party
because
while
atlantic
owes
that
duty
to
mr.
benazet
,
erie's
duty
is
quite
different,
mainly
to
pay
compensation
under
the
act.
i
want
to
make
it
clear
of
course
that
benazet
never
sued
eries
in
this
case.
benazet
sued
atlantic
and
erie
was
in
pleading.
therefore,
even
if
the
contribution
is
not
absolutely
barred
as
a
general
proposition,
you
must
then
decide
whether
the
act,
in
view
of
the
very
clear
language
nevertheless
makes
erie
somehow
subject
to
contribution.
now,
the
second
problem
i'd
like
to
point
out
is
that
if
you
said
contribution
was
somehow
available,
what
do
you
do
about
the
conflict
between
contribution
and
erie's
own
right
to
indemnity
in
this
case.
of
course
it
was
not
appropriate
in
the
trial
court
here
to
submit
to
the
jury,
erie's
claim
for
indemnity
because
under
erie's
theory
neither
under
state
law
nor
maritime
law
nor
any
other
law,
did
it
owe
anything,
and
therefore,
the
question
of
indemnity
never
arose.
but
if
you
were
now
to
say
the
contribution,
contribution
was
available
to
atlantic
upon
remand,
erie
could,
we
submit,
obtain
indemnity
against
atlantic
as
the
real
party
at
fall.
now,
if
i
may,
ask
the
court's
indulgence
to
turn
to
page
13
of
the
joint
appendix.
this
is
the
atlantic's
complaint
against
erie
and
in
paragraph
6
there
on
page
13,
you
will
see
what
they
charged
erie
with.
this
is
all
they
charged
erie
with
and
this
is
all
--
the
only
reason
erie
got
into
the
case.
in
plain
language,
in
paragraph
6,
they
charges
with
nothing
more
than
a
failure
to
inspect.
now,
you
have
held
in
ryan
and
(inaudible),
repeatedly,
“where
there
is
a
duty
of
seaworthiness
on
the
part
of
the
ship
owner,
the
ship
owner
can
then
implead
the
party
really
responsible
for
the
accident
if
the
ship
owners'
only
duty
was
to
inspect
and
can
obtain
indemnity.”
that's
precisely
our
situation
here.
they
claim
we
failed
to
inspect.
we
would
show
that
this
was
their
car,
that
over
two-year
period
it
became
in
terrible
shape
and
they
didn't
do
anything
about
it,
and
so
forth
and
we
would
say
that
we
are
entitled
to
indemnity
here.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
the
basis
for
the
indemnity
in
this
case
would
probably
be
both.
it
would
be
a
duty
on
behalf
of
the
owning
line
in
contract,
not
to
pass
along
its
own
car
to
a
connecting
carrier
when
it
was
not
in
proper
shape
and
in
tort
for
imposing
upon
others
a
defective
car.
it
would
might
well
be
both
or
either.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
think
indemnity
is
usually
a
contractual
indemnity
or
warrant,
either
contractual
warranty,
but
the
lower
courts
your
honor
have
now
developed
a
theory
of,
of
sort
of
tort
indemnity
or
quasi
contractual
indemnity
and
whether
that
would
apply
here
and
whether
this
court
would
accept
that,
i
don't
know.
but
in
view
of
the
fact
that
i
think
we
could
recover
under
either
theory,
i
don't
think
it
controls
here.
in
any
event,
under
your
prior
cases,
since
we
would
clearly
be
entitled
to
the
indemnity
against
atlantic,
now
what
do
you
do
with
the
conflicting
claim
of
contribution
whereas
the
parties
would
somehow
split
the
judgment
50-50
or
otherwise
and
our
claim
for
complete
indemnity,
that's
the
next
point
you
would
have
to
resolve
here.
then
you
come
to
the
problem
of
the
conflict
between
various
statutes
here.
as
you
remember
in
halcyon,
one
of
the
reasons
the
court
didn't
want
to
say
there
was
contribution
was
that
congress
had
passed
all
these
other
statutes
and
that
contribution
was
somehow
going
to
fit
into
the
pattern
established
by
congress.
just
to
give
you
an
example
here,
there
is
a
limitation
liability
act
and
we
would
be
limited
to
the
value
of
the
car
flow
and
to
the
cargo,
which
is
not
in
the
record,
but
i
am
told
that
it's
somewhere
around
$34,000,
$35,000,
$40,000.
now,
what
do
you
do?
if
you're
going
to
say
there
is
a
50-50
split,
we
owe
100,000
but
you
have
got
the
limitation
liability
act,
we
only
owe
35,000
or
40,000,
what
about
the
harbor
act?
you
are
going
to
have
to
work
this
contribution
in
somehow
to
all
these
other
statutes,
is
that
a
problem?
there
are
other
problems
which
unfortunately
i
don't
have
time
to
go
into
such
as
what
the
proper
split
would
be.
we
think
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
in
halcyon
ought
to
control
or
ought
to
be
strictly
based
on
fault
and
not
50-50
and
so
forth.
they're
a
number
of
problems
which
you
would
have
to
reach.
in
conclusion,
let
me
simply
say
that
to
grant
contribution
now
after
20
years
of
halcyon
would
have
an
extremely
unsettling
effect
on
maritime
law
generally.
it
would
throw
out
the
carefully
drawn
line
between
indemnity
and
contribution
which
has
been
established
by
this
case
and
so
many
cases
and
it
would
in
fact
create
a
conflict
between
the
two.
it
would
dilute
the
owner's
responsibility
to
correct
effects
because
from
their
standpoint,
let's
face
it,
the
way
these
railroad
cars
go
by
the
luck
of
the
draw,
this
car
is
probably
going
to
end
up
on
somebody's
else's
line
rather
than
theirs,
and
therefore,
if
you're
going
to
dilute
responsibility
around
among
the
various
lines
who
had
the
car
or
even
share
it
with
the
one
where
the
accident
happen
to
happen,
so
much
the
better
for
the
owning
line.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
during
the
time
that
the
--
there
was
testimony
that
the
defect
had
taken
at
least
two
year
post
effects,
and
it
had
taken
at
least
two
years
to
develop.
the
eroded
board
and
the
fissure
in
the
brake
equipment
itself,
could
not
have
occurred
overnight.
that
it
took
at
least
two
years
for
that
to
develop.
it
developed
slowly
and
that
during
that
time,
if
the
car
had
been
properly
inspected,
these
defects
would
have
been
discovered.
during
that
two
year
period,
49
different
railroads
had
had
this
car
in
their
possession.
yes
sir!
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
it
would
impose
on
employers
in
direct
contradiction
to
the
clear
and
unmistakable
language
of
the
harbor
workers
act,
a
duty
to
pay
not
only
compensation,
regardless
of
fault,
but
an
additional
judgment
based
on
what
the
two
court
of
appeals
have
passed.
and
with
that,
unless
you
have
questions,
and
i
think
the
judgment
clearly
ought
to
be
affirmed.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
barrett
prettyman
and
i
represent
the
respondent
the
erie
lackawanna
railway
in
this
case.
i
think
there
is
something
superficially
appealing
about
the
proposition
advanced
by
petitioner
here.
we
have
two
people
at
fault
plus
petitioner,
make
them
divide
the
damages
which
are
due
to
injured
party.
well,
it's
not
so
simple
and
i
think
once
we
will
get
into
it,
i
will
show
that
it's
not
so
appealing
either.
let's
look
first
to
see
how
the
rule
would
operate
within
the
specific
facts
of
this
case
and
then
let's
see
how
they
would
operate
generally.
there
were
two
serious
defects
in
this
railroad
car
which
was
owned
by
atlantic
and
both
of
these
defects
were
at
least
two
years
old.
during
those
two
years,
this
boxcar
had
been
in
the
possession
of
49
different
railroads.
it
had
been
in
the
possession
of
7
railroads
as
often
or
more
often
than
it
had
been
in
the
erie's
possession.
it
had
been
in
atlantic's
own
possession
eight
times,
twice
as
many
as
it
had
been
in
erie's.
more
importantly,
it
had
been
in
atlantic's
repair
shop
for
other
repairs,
at
least
four
times
during
this
period
and
there
were
three
additional
inspection
reports
by
atlantic,
one
of
them
within
seven
weeks
of
this
accident.
it
had
never
been
in
erie's
repair
shop.
now,
the
test
--
the
relevance
of
that
is
this.
the
testimony
shows
that
the
owning
railroad
has
a
very
special
duty
in
regard
to
its
own
cars.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
three
days.
the
only
railroad
when
it
has
its
car,
now
this
is
not
just
in
the
repair
shop,
but
when
it
gets
hold
of
its
own
car,
it
looks
for
cardable
(ph)
damage,
damage
which
was
done
by
others
and
should
have
been
repaired
by
others,
it
wasn't.
it
looks
for
excessive
wear
and
tries
to
anticipate
excessive
wear.
it
looks
also
at
empty
cars
and
this
is
important
because
in
this
case
for
example,
the
car
was
full.
we
couldn't
have
looked
inside
and
while
the
particular
defect
happened
to
be
outside,
it
indicates
the
only
railroad
has
more
of
a
chance
to
review
the
damage
to
a
car
and
moreover,
once
the
car
goes
into
the
repair
shop,
it
gets
a
complete
inspection
supposedly
from
top
to
bottom.
thus
while
the
normal
inspection
of
a
braking
system
which
is
done
by
a
car
into
its
possession,
the
car
happens
to
fall,
is
a
two
minute
examination,
normally
walking
around
the
car
and
inspecting
things
on
sight.
the
owning
car
has
a
special
duty
to
look
at
its
own
cars
and
particularly
when
it's
in
his
own
repair
shop
and
remember
this
car
was
in
atlantic's
own
repair
shop
four
times
during
this
two-year
period.
it
was
pure
happenstance,
that
this
accident
happened
while
the
car
happened
to
be
in
erie's
possession,
rather
than
somebody
else's,
one
of
these
48
other
railroads.
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
the
car
float
or
a
car
barge
which
was
what
erie,
erie
owned
here,
nothing
wrong
with
that.
there
is
no
evidence
that
mr.
benezet,
who
was
erie's
employee
was
negligent,
or
contributorily
negligent,
in
fact,
the
jury
said
no
he
wasn't.
there
was
no
evidence
that
any
other
erie
employee
was
in
anyway
negligent
either.
this
accident
could
as
easily
have
happened
on
any
other
person's
properties
as
erie's.
following
the
accident
and
here
is
rather
unique
point
going
to
your
point
mr.
justice
white,
following
the
accident,
erie
promptly
paid
mr.
benazet
over
$11,000
under
the
longshoremen
&
harbor
workers'
act.
and
i
think
one
of
the
interesting
facts
here
is
that
you
have
a
man,
who
was
paid
under
the
longshoremen's
act,
treated
as
a
longshoremen
and
yet
if
he
is
a
ship
owner,
why
isn't
he
a
crewman
and
if
i
may
very
respectfully
suggest
that
this
is
one
of
a
number
of
reasons
why,
my
own
view
is
that
this
is
quite
an
inappropriate
case
to
decide
this
far-reaching
question
of
maritime
law
because
you
do
have
this
confusion
between
things
like
the
safety
appliance
act
and
the
longshoremen's
act
and
so
forth,
in
this
particular
rather
peculiar
incident
where
you
have
railroad
car
sitting
on
a
car
bridge.
maritime
law
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
and
which
is
precise
the
end-point.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i
might
say
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no
sir,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
both
parties
agree
that
maritime
law
applies,
but
you
do
have
these
rather
peculiar
facts
over
and
above
your
normal
maritime
time
situation,
including
trying
to
figure
out
which
party
is
equal
to
the
stevedoring
company
and
which
party
is
equal
to
the
shipowners.
now
i
want
to
emphasize
that
in
paying
under
the
longshoremen's
act,
erie
had
no
choice.
this
was
an
absolute
duty
and
without
relation
before,
no
normal
defenses
applied,
such
as
the
fellow-servant
or
assumption
or
as
a
contributory
negligence.
now,
we
had
to
pay
that
money
without
regard
to
anything.
we
had
to
pay
it
and
we
paid
it
and
that
money
has
been
paid.
now,
those
are
the
facts
against
which,
we
approach
the
law
in
this
case.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
correct,
correct.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
and
it
was
the
longshoremen,
that's
correct.
now,
to
turn
to
the
law,
there
was
no
contribution
as
you
know,
in
common
law
and
then
the
courts
fashioned
an
exception
in
collision
cases.
what
halcyon
did
really,
was
to
extend,
was
to
refuse
to
extend
this
particular
exception
to
noncollision
cases.
why?
well
i
think
it
did
so
for
a
very
good
reason.
congress
had
repeatedly
legislated
in
this
field.
harbor
workers'
act,
harbor
act,
jones
act,
public
vessels
act,
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
extension
of
admiralty
jurisdiction
act,
limited
liability
act
and
yet
it
had
repeatedly
refused
to
provide
for
contribution.
if
there
really
was
a
need
for
contribution,
said
this
court
in
halcyon.
let
congress
provide
for
it.
congress
is
better
suited
to
say,
not
only
whether
contribution
ought
to
be
provided,
but
also
if
so,
what
measure
of
contribution
should
be
provided,
that
is
equally
divided,
proportionate
or
as
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
halcyon,
limited
by
the
amount
of
compensation,
which
the
employer
would
have
paid,
if
in
that
case,
he
had
paid
it.
the
court
pointed
out
that
there
are
awful
lot
of
people
interested
in
these
admiralty
matters
and
they
could
present
their
diversion
views
to
congress
and
these
views
could
be
reconciled.
now
that
was
20
years
ago.
congress
has
refused
to
change
the
halcyon
rule.
where
are
all
those
people
who
were
so
quick
to
find
maritime
abusive,
the
insurance
companies,
maritime
administration,
interior,
treasury,
justice,
commerce
department.
insurance
companies
as
i
said,
shipping
and
stevedoring
companies
union.
they
have
not
come
forward
to
complain
about
the
halcyon
rule.
it
is
true,
as
we
stress
that
congress
has
introduced
bills
which
we
think
would
have
the
effect
of
changing
halcyon,
but
the
interesting
thing
about
it
is
that
the
reports
on
those
bills
not
only
indicate
that
congress
didn't
have
in
mind
changing
halcyon,
but
more
importantly,
none
of
those
bills
have
even
gone
out
of
committee.
congress
is
satisfied
with
the
halcyon
rule
as
established
by
this
court.
now
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
was
informed
several
days
ago
that
on
may
2,
s525,
which
was
introduced
on
behalf
of
the
administration
will
have
hearings
in
the
congress
and
with
the
chief
justice's
permission,
i
would
like
to
submit
copies.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
may,
of
that
bill
to
the
clerk,
copies,
i
have
given
copies
today
to
my
opponent.
that
bill
would
make
a
compensation
the
exclusive
remedy
by
anyone
against
any
employer
and
this
even
would
include
indemnity.
secretary
of
labor
as
i
understand
would
testify
first
on
may
2.
so
this
is
hardly
a
dead
issue
in
congress.
this
issue,
which
this
court
said
in
halcyon
was
peculiarly
one
for
the
congress,
is
actively
under
consideration.
i
would
next
like
to
point
out
that
even
if
halcyon
were
restrictive
in
some
way,
there
would
be
no
contribution
here.
in
halcyon
no
compensation
was
paid.
the
injured
worker
sued
the
shipowner,
which
impleaded
the
employer
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
employer
was
liable
in
contribution
only
for
the
amount
it
would
have
paid
in
compensation,
if
the
employee
had
elected
to
sue
for
compensation,
but
in
this
case,
erie
has
already
paid
compensation.
so
even
if
the
halcyon
rule
is
restricted
back
to
the
view
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
that
case,
erie
still
owes
nothing
here.
secondly,
in
halcyon,
the
employer
was
the
real
party
at
fault,
not
the
shipowner.
the
jury
found
in
that
case
that
the
employer
was
75%
negligent
and
here
of
course
the
situation
is
reversed.
so
if
the
court
adopted
a
rule
of
contribution,
which
was
designed
to
make
sure
that
the
chief
wrongdoer
will
not
be
immune
from
all
liability,
which
really
happened
in
halcyon,
that
purpose
would
not
be
served
by
contribution
in
this
case.
but
in
any
event
we
claim
that
halcyon
shouldn’t
be
cut
back,
much
less
to
overruled.
barring
contribution
is
entirely
consistent
with
established
law.
unlike
indemnity,
contribution
is
based
on
joint
liability
as
joint
tortfeasors
to
a
common
injured
party
resulting
from
a
single
tort.
this
court
has
made
that
distinction
many
times.
there
is
no
such
joint
liability
here.
erie’s
obligation
without
regard
to
fault
to
this
injured
party
was
to
paying
compensation
under
the
act,
which
it
did.
mr.
benazet,
the
injured
employee
could
not
have
sued
erie
for
negligence.
with
all
due
respect,
mr.
justice
stewart
indicated
a
minute
ago,
that
the
court
had
established
that
anyone
could
sue
for
negligence,
that
is
accurate
with
a
single
exception
[attempt
to
laughter].
here
the
longshoremen
cannot
sue
his
employer
for
negligence.
the
furtherest
the
court
is
gone
in
the
yaka
and
lykes
brothers
case
is
to
say
that
he
can
sue
for
unseaworthiness
if
the
employer
is
also
the
owner
of
the
vessel
and
the
employer
is
solely
responsible.
but
there
is
a
large
difference
between
suing
for
unseaworthiness
and
a
suing
for
negligence.
on
negligence,
we
are
absolutely
protected
by
the
specific
words
of
this
act.
the
act
could
hardly
be
clear
in
regard
to
that.
therefore,
contribution
is
totally
inapplicable
here.
now
as
to
the
equities
of
this
situation,
a
strongly
favor
of
erie
and
i
would
like
to
point
--.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes
sir
and
i
am
going
to
submit
that
to
the
clerk
and
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
there
is
a
committee
hearing
set
for
may
2.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
the
thrust
of
the
bill
would
provide
that
no
one
can
recover
against
the
employer
who
has
paid
compensation
at
all
that
is
either
in
contribution
or
indemnity,
it
doesn’t
use
those
words,
but
it
in
effect,
makes
compensation
the
exclusive
remedy,
would
affect
even
this
court’s
indemnity
cases
really.
because
it
would
--
what
it
would
really
do
is
to
make
explicitly
clear
that
the
act
means
what
a
lot
of
us
had
assumed
[attempt
to
laughter]
that
meant
originally
and
that
was
that
when
you
pay
compensation,
that's
it.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes
sir.
[attempt
to
laughter]
now
the
same
argument,
precisely
the
same
argument
that
atlantic
is
making
here
in
terms
of
the
equities,
that
was
made
by
the
shipowner
in
pope
&
talbot
v.
hawn.
i
would
like
you
to
refer
very
specifically
to
that
case
because
in
that
case
here’s
what
the
shipowner
argued.
he
said
to
allow
the
employee
to
get
full
recovery
and
then
to
pay
over
to
his
employer,
what
he
had
received
in
contribute
--
in
that
compensation,
would
reward
the
employer
who
had
also
been
negligent,
that
was
precisely
the
argument
that
he
made.
this
court
said
no,
the
act
intends
that
employers
who
are
absolutely
liable
to
employees
for
compensation
being
protected.
therefore
if
the
court
overrules
halcyon,
it's
also
going
to
have
to
rule
this
portion
of
hawn
as
well.
moreover,
it’s
simply
not
fair
to
impose
contribution
in
this
case
for
this
reason.
here,
erie
and
atlanta
of
course
happen
both
to
be
parties,
but
in
another
cases,
where
the
employer
recovers
against
the
third-party,
that
third-party
can
turn
around
and
sue
the
employer
later
for
contribution,
doesn’t
have
to
be
on
the
same
suit
and
when
it
does,
the
employer
is
not
allowed
many
of
the
normal
defenses,
including
statute
limitations.
the
burden
in
these
cases,
we
submit,
should
fall
on
the
responsible
party.
there’s
no
question
here
as
judge
cooper
found
that
there
was
no
intervening
cause
between
the
negligence
of
this
boxcar’s
owner
and
the
accident.
more
importantly,
the
burden
and
this
is
something
that's
been
developed
in
your
recent
cases,
the
burden
should
fall
on
the
party
best
able
to
prevent
the
accident.
this
theme
runs
through
so
many
of
your
recent
opinions.
isn’t
that
what
we’re
really
trying
to
do
here.
we're
going
to
talk
about
the
acts
of
equity,
trying
to
prevent
the
accident
itself.
if
atlantic
can
get
contribution
from
erie,
when
erie's
only
fault,
only
fault
was
a
failure
to
inspect.
that's
what
the
pleading
even
said
on
behalf
of
atlantic,
that’s
all
we
were
ever
charged
with,
was
a
failure
to
inspect.
i
see
no
reason
why
we
couldn’t
bring
in
the
other
railroads
as
well,
rather
atlantic
could
bring
in
the
other
railroad
as
well,
who
had
had
this
car
in
their
possession
and
further
dilute
its
responsibility.
but
even
if
it
splits
only
with
us,
the
net
effect
is
to
give
comfort
to
this
one
party
best
able
to
cure
the
defects
in
this
boxcar
and
that's
its
owner.
if
you
gave
contribution
in
this
case,
you
would
be
saying
that
atlantic
doesn’t
owe
a
$100,000
of
this
judgment,
even
though
for
two
years
it
allowed
its
own
boxcar
to
stay
in
this
condition
and
even
though
it
had
this
boxcar
in
its
possession
8
times
in
its
own
shop,
four
times,
and
never
could
detected
this
condition
in
its
own
boxcars.
now
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
you
in
the
light
of
the
rather
simplistic
argument
that
you
should
simply
allow
contribution
to
some
of
the
difficulties
and
a
few
other
things
that
you
will
have
to
face
if
you
say
that
it
is
applicable
to
this
case.
first,
if
you
decide
that
contribution
is
not
absolutely
barred
as
a
kind
of
general
proposition,
then
you’re
going
to
have
to
face
the
question
that
would
not
have
to
be
decided
in
halcyon
and
that
is
does
the
harbor
workers'
act
bar
contribution
where
the
employer
has
paid
compensation?
again,
i
can
only
say,
i
am
not
going
to
read
it
to
you,
you’re
familiar
with
it,
the
language
is
absolutely
clear
and
no
case
i
emphasize
by
this
court
is
held
to
the
contrary.
secondly,
if
for
some
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
address
myself
and
that
why
you
acknowledge
in
that
respect.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes.
in
the
yaka
and
lykes
brothers,
with
right
respect
i
suggest
that
court
didn’t
go
that
far.
what
it
said
was
that
the
longshoremen
could
sue
for
unseaworthiness,
but
only
in
the
situation
where
the
employer
was
also
the
shipowner
and
was
solely
responsible.
in
both
those
cases,
the
shipowner
was
solely
responsible
of
the
act.
it
did
not
address
itself
to
the
negligence
question
and
neither
did
the
(inaudible)
case
which
involved
the
invitee.
i
suggest
that
the
court
has
never
held
that
--
against
the
language
of
the
act,
that
you
can
sue
for
negligence
which
is
an
entirely
different
thing.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
that's
right,
really.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yeah,
yes.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
that's
quite--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
because
in
the
shipowner
situation,
you
really
--
you
have
a
non-delegable
duty
or
as
the
owner
of
the
ship
in
regard
to
unseaworthiness,
but
you
can
in
turn,
turn
around
and
get
indemnity
by
bringing
in
the
real
party
in
interest.
now
in
this
case,
you
are
suing
directly
for
negligence
presumably,
the
party
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
as
a
shipowner,
that's
right,
which
you
see
has
a
peculiar
proposition
here
as
that
you
have
got
a
longshoreman
who
is
also
[attempt
to
laughter]
a
seaman,
in
the
sense
that
he
is
the
employee
of
the
--
i
also
would
like
to
point
out
that
in
the
yaka
and
lykes
brothers,
no
rights
were
established
in
third-parties
at
all.
this
related
entirely
to
the
suit
directly
between
the
longshoreman
and
his
employer.
no
rights
and
third-parties
were
established.
so
that
we
have
the
additional
distinction,
not
only
was
it
a
suit
for
unseaworthiness,
not
only
was
their
sole
responsibility,
but
here,
we're
really
talking
about
even
if
you
have
the
suit,
even
if
you
allow
the
suit
for
negligence
on
some
theoretical
ground,
aren't
you
then
face
to
face
with
the
language
of
the
statute,
that
is
despite
some
theoretical
right
to
sue
when
the
statute
says,
that
compensation
shall
be
the
sole
remedy
against
the
employer,
aren't
you
face
to
face
with
the
statute
--
?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well
the
longshoremen's
act
your
honor
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i'm
sorry,
but
i
respectfully
disagree
with
that.
the
language
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
the
language
your
honor,
let
me
just
find
the
language
here.
can
i
have
that
--?
the
language
says,
“the
liability
of
an
employer
prescribed
in
section
904,
shall
be
exclusive
and
in
place
of
all
other
liability
of
such
employer
to
the
employee,
his
legal
representatives,
husband
or
wife,
parents,
dependents,
next
of
kin
and
anyone
otherwise
entitled
to
recover
damages
from
such
employer
at
law
or
an
admiralty
on
account
of
such
injury
or
death.”
now
what
could
be
clear
than
that.
if
you
allow
contribution
after
mr.
benazet
has
recovered
for
negligence
against
atlantic,
if
you
allow
contribution,
you're
allowing
it
not
on
an
indemnity
theory,
that
to
somehow
there
is
--
something
owing
as
between
erie
and
atlantic,
because
there
isn't.
you
are
allowing
it
because
of
the
common
tortfeasor
status
to
mr.
benazet.
it
is
only
through
his
recovery
against
atlantic
that
somehow
we
would
have
to
owe
atlantic
something.
this
is
not
indemnity,
atlantic
specifically
said
in
this
suit
that
we
did
not
owe
them
for
indemnity.
they
are
not
saying
we
warranted
anything
or
we
owe
them
some
duty.
they're
saying
that
because
we
have
to
pay
mr.
benazet,
because
we
are
negligent
to
mr.
benazet,
you
as
a
joint
tortfeasor
owe
us
compensation.
the
statute
specifically
says
that
our
liability
should
be
exclusive
not
only
to
him,
but
to
anyone
otherwise
entitled
to
recover
damage
on
account
of
injury.
i
just
can't
imagine
how
language
could
be
more
specific
than
that.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
you
mean
that
--
not
his
employer,
sued?
yes,
certainly.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
he
did
sue
somebody
else.
he
sued
atlantic,
which
was
not
the
shipowner
and
he
did
recover.
and
now
the
shipowner
--
now
the
non-shipowner
so
to
speak,
the
third-party,
normally
let's
say
the
stevedoring
company,
is
attempting
not
to
get
indemnity
from
us,
because
of
something
that
we
owe
directly
to
them.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
they're
saying
because
of
the
common
liability
as
joint
tortfeasors
to
mr.
benazet,
and
that's
precisely
what
the
act
says
you
can't
do.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
exactly
your
honor.
we
are
not
a
joint
tortfeasor,
solely
because
of
the
kind
of
idea
that
even
if
you
allowed
contribution
here,
we
are
going
to
get
indemnity
from
them
because
that's
precisely
what
you
allow
in
these
cases.
do
you
want
me
to
continue
your
honor?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
alright,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
was
about
to
start
something
new
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
i
was
naming
some
of
the
problems
that
would
face
the
court,
if
contribution
were
now
to
be
allowed
as
a
general
proposition
and
i
was
pointing
out
that
the
first
problem
of
course
would
be
the
harbor
workers
act
and
i
was
saying
that
the
erie
and
atlantic
are
not
joint
tortfeasors
owing
a
common
duty
in
tort
to
benazet,
the
injured
party
because
while
atlantic
owes
that
duty
to
mr.
benazet
,
erie's
duty
is
quite
different,
mainly
to
pay
compensation
under
the
act.
i
want
to
make
it
clear
of
course
that
benazet
never
sued
eries
in
this
case.
benazet
sued
atlantic
and
erie
was
in
pleading.
therefore,
even
if
the
contribution
is
not
absolutely
barred
as
a
general
proposition,
you
must
then
decide
whether
the
act,
in
view
of
the
very
clear
language
nevertheless
makes
erie
somehow
subject
to
contribution.
now,
the
second
problem
i'd
like
to
point
out
is
that
if
you
said
contribution
was
somehow
available,
what
do
you
do
about
the
conflict
between
contribution
and
erie's
own
right
to
indemnity
in
this
case.
of
course
it
was
not
appropriate
in
the
trial
court
here
to
submit
to
the
jury,
erie's
claim
for
indemnity
because
under
erie's
theory
neither
under
state
law
nor
maritime
law
nor
any
other
law,
did
it
owe
anything,
and
therefore,
the
question
of
indemnity
never
arose.
but
if
you
were
now
to
say
the
contribution,
contribution
was
available
to
atlantic
upon
remand,
erie
could,
we
submit,
obtain
indemnity
against
atlantic
as
the
real
party
at
fall.
now,
if
i
may,
ask
the
court's
indulgence
to
turn
to
page
13
of
the
joint
appendix.
this
is
the
atlantic's
complaint
against
erie
and
in
paragraph
6
there
on
page
13,
you
will
see
what
they
charged
erie
with.
this
is
all
they
charged
erie
with
and
this
is
all
--
the
only
reason
erie
got
into
the
case.
in
plain
language,
in
paragraph
6,
they
charges
with
nothing
more
than
a
failure
to
inspect.
now,
you
have
held
in
ryan
and
(inaudible),
repeatedly,
“where
there
is
a
duty
of
seaworthiness
on
the
part
of
the
ship
owner,
the
ship
owner
can
then
implead
the
party
really
responsible
for
the
accident
if
the
ship
owners'
only
duty
was
to
inspect
and
can
obtain
indemnity.”
that's
precisely
our
situation
here.
they
claim
we
failed
to
inspect.
we
would
show
that
this
was
their
car,
that
over
two-year
period
it
became
in
terrible
shape
and
they
didn't
do
anything
about
it,
and
so
forth
and
we
would
say
that
we
are
entitled
to
indemnity
here.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
the
basis
for
the
indemnity
in
this
case
would
probably
be
both.
it
would
be
a
duty
on
behalf
of
the
owning
line
in
contract,
not
to
pass
along
its
own
car
to
a
connecting
carrier
when
it
was
not
in
proper
shape
and
in
tort
for
imposing
upon
others
a
defective
car.
it
would
might
well
be
both
or
either.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
think
indemnity
is
usually
a
contractual
indemnity
or
warrant,
either
contractual
warranty,
but
the
lower
courts
your
honor
have
now
developed
a
theory
of,
of
sort
of
tort
indemnity
or
quasi
contractual
indemnity
and
whether
that
would
apply
here
and
whether
this
court
would
accept
that,
i
don't
know.
but
in
view
of
the
fact
that
i
think
we
could
recover
under
either
theory,
i
don't
think
it
controls
here.
in
any
event,
under
your
prior
cases,
since
we
would
clearly
be
entitled
to
the
indemnity
against
atlantic,
now
what
do
you
do
with
the
conflicting
claim
of
contribution
whereas
the
parties
would
somehow
split
the
judgment
50-50
or
otherwise
and
our
claim
for
complete
indemnity,
that's
the
next
point
you
would
have
to
resolve
here.
then
you
come
to
the
problem
of
the
conflict
between
various
statutes
here.
as
you
remember
in
halcyon,
one
of
the
reasons
the
court
didn't
want
to
say
there
was
contribution
was
that
congress
had
passed
all
these
other
statutes
and
that
contribution
was
somehow
going
to
fit
into
the
pattern
established
by
congress.
just
to
give
you
an
example
here,
there
is
a
limitation
liability
act
and
we
would
be
limited
to
the
value
of
the
car
flow
and
to
the
cargo,
which
is
not
in
the
record,
but
i
am
told
that
it's
somewhere
around
$34,000,
$35,000,
$40,000.
now,
what
do
you
do?
if
you're
going
to
say
there
is
a
50-50
split,
we
owe
100,000
but
you
have
got
the
limitation
liability
act,
we
only
owe
35,000
or
40,000,
what
about
the
harbor
act?
you
are
going
to
have
to
work
this
contribution
in
somehow
to
all
these
other
statutes,
is
that
a
problem?
there
are
other
problems
which
unfortunately
i
don't
have
time
to
go
into
such
as
what
the
proper
split
would
be.
we
think
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
in
halcyon
ought
to
control
or
ought
to
be
strictly
based
on
fault
and
not
50-50
and
so
forth.
they're
a
number
of
problems
which
you
would
have
to
reach.
in
conclusion,
let
me
simply
say
that
to
grant
contribution
now
after
20
years
of
halcyon
would
have
an
extremely
unsettling
effect
on
maritime
law
generally.
it
would
throw
out
the
carefully
drawn
line
between
indemnity
and
contribution
which
has
been
established
by
this
case
and
so
many
cases
and
it
would
in
fact
create
a
conflict
between
the
two.
it
would
dilute
the
owner's
responsibility
to
correct
effects
because
from
their
standpoint,
let's
face
it,
the
way
these
railroad
cars
go
by
the
luck
of
the
draw,
this
car
is
probably
going
to
end
up
on
somebody's
else's
line
rather
than
theirs,
and
therefore,
if
you're
going
to
dilute
responsibility
around
among
the
various
lines
who
had
the
car
or
even
share
it
with
the
one
where
the
accident
happen
to
happen,
so
much
the
better
for
the
owning
line.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
during
the
time
that
the
--
there
was
testimony
that
the
defect
had
taken
at
least
two
year
post
effects,
and
it
had
taken
at
least
two
years
to
develop.
the
eroded
board
and
the
fissure
in
the
brake
equipment
itself,
could
not
have
occurred
overnight.
that
it
took
at
least
two
years
for
that
to
develop.
it
developed
slowly
and
that
during
that
time,
if
the
car
had
been
properly
inspected,
these
defects
would
have
been
discovered.
during
that
two
year
period,
49
different
railroads
had
had
this
car
in
their
possession.
yes
sir!
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
it
would
impose
on
employers
in
direct
contradiction
to
the
clear
and
unmistakable
language
of
the
harbor
workers
act,
a
duty
to
pay
not
only
compensation,
regardless
of
fault,
but
an
additional
judgment
based
on
what
the
two
court
of
appeals
have
passed.
and
with
that,
unless
you
have
questions,
and
i
think
the
judgment
clearly
ought
to
be
affirmed.
