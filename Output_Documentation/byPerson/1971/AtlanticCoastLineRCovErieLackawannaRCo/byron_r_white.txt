justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
if
you
did
it
proportionately?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
the
usual
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
cause
of
--
what
kind
of
a
maritime
cause
of
action
was
it
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
this
was
a,
was
this
a
suit
by
what
against
whom?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it
by
a
seaman?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
was
this
fellow
a
longshoremen?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
–
well,
why
wasn't
he
a
seaman?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright
he
was
a
railroad
worker,
but
he
was
on
a
--
wasn't
he
employed
by
erie?
justice
byron
r.
white
wasn’t
he
employed
by
erie?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
erie
owned
a
ship?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
was
employed
by
erie?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
he
was
performing
the
a
longshoreman's
job?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
jones
act
isn't
available
for
longshoreman,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
a
longshoreman,
if
he
sues
a
shipowner,
if
a
longshoreman
sues
a
shipowner
not
for
seaworthy,
but
for
negligence,
what
is
that,
just
a
maritime
cause
of
action
for
negligence
or
can
he
sue
a
shipowner
for
negligence?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but,
how
about
negligence?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
here
is
a
longshoreman
suing
a
shipowner?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
could
he
have
sued
the
shipowner
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
for
negligence?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that
but
the
liability
you
established
here
was
for
negligence?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
and
you
want
to
assert
that
against
erie?
justice
byron
r.
white
wasn’t
the
critical
thing
in
the
reed
--
in
the
yaka
that
the
shipowner
was
being
sued
not
as
a
longshoremen
but
as
a
shipowner?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
the
longshoremen
was
an
act
protected
--
longshoremen,
that's
a
stevedoring
company.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
a
shipowner.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
wouldn't
the
same
approach
permit
the
suit
for
negligence
against
a
shipowner,
rather
than
against
an
employer?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
a
shipowner?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
but
the
longshoreman's
act
doesn't
deal
with
the
shipowners
liability?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
longshoremen's
act
doesn't
prohibit
recoveries
against
the
shipowner,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
suppose
you
would
--[attempt
to
laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
this
barge
had
been
owned
by
somebody
else,
this
longshoreman
that
have
sued
the
shipowner
is
negligent?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
his
employer
happens
to
own
the
boat,
or
own
the
ship.
you
say
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
view
of
that
basis
for
the
indemnity
toward
a
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
do
you
think
our
cases
put
the
indemnity
on
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
if
you
did
it
proportionately?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
the
usual
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
cause
of
--
what
kind
of
a
maritime
cause
of
action
was
it
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
this
was
a,
was
this
a
suit
by
what
against
whom?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it
by
a
seaman?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
was
this
fellow
a
longshoremen?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
–
well,
why
wasn't
he
a
seaman?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright
he
was
a
railroad
worker,
but
he
was
on
a
--
wasn't
he
employed
by
erie?
justice
byron
r.
white
wasn’t
he
employed
by
erie?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
erie
owned
a
ship?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
was
employed
by
erie?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
he
was
performing
the
a
longshoreman's
job?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
jones
act
isn't
available
for
longshoreman,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
a
longshoreman,
if
he
sues
a
shipowner,
if
a
longshoreman
sues
a
shipowner
not
for
seaworthy,
but

no,
but
here
is
a

but,
could
he
have
sued
the
shipowner
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
for
negligence?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that

the
