fifth
amendment
cases

to
do
it,
don't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
amsterdam,
is
there
any
other
group
that
can
tell
a
grand
jury
or

be

justice
thurgood
marshall
group
of
people
in
the
united
states,
when
they
get
a
grand
jury
subpoena,
can
say
i
won't
come?
justice
thurgood
marshall
who?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you're
talking
about
a
group.
you
said
anybody
who
has
the
word
reporter
in
his
vocabulary,
is
it,
or
did
you
draw
a
line?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
am
speaking
about
1972?
in
california,
what
proof
is
there
that
has
this
privilege
of
not
even
going,
i
mean,
a
lawyer
can
go
to
the
grand
jury
and
say
what
you
want
for
me
would
violate
the
lawyer-client
privilege,
and
i
won't
tell
you,
the
doctor
can
say
and
they
have
their
privileges
fairly
established,
but
they
go
and
raised
that
privilege,
but
as
i
understand
your
point,
they
don't
even
have
to
go
to
the
grand
jury?
justice
thurgood
marshall
let's
get
to
this
point.
wouldn't
it
be,
you
wouldn't
raise
the
question,
as
i
understand
a
part
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
that
government
has
a
responsibility
for
showing
what
they
need
you
for,
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
would
happen
for
example,
if
mr.
caldwell
was
talking
to
members
of
the
high
pollutant
fly
people,
a
confidentially
etcetera,
and
he
gets
subpoenaed
and
he
says
i
don't
have
to
come
because
whatever
i
heard
was
confidential,
and
the
government
shows,
yeah,
but
while
you
were
there
they
brought
out
two
dead
bodies.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
have
no
problem
with
it.
justice
thurgood
