justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
mr.
solicitor
general
what
about
--
what
is
this
court
of
appeals
trying
to
--
is
this,
i
am
looking
at
125,
“if
this
is
true
and
the
government
apparently
has
not
believed
it's
necessary
to
excuse.
”
the
next
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
it
has
disputed
now
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
are
you
suggesting
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
the
government
agreed
with
the
appellant's
assertion
on
first
sentence,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask
mr.
amsterdam,
let's
take
this
very
protective
order,
an
article
which
had
been
published
in
the
new
york
times
attributing
to
someone,
an
admission
that
he
had
committed
a
murder.
in
that
circumstance,
would
this
very
protective
order,
would
that
be
a
situation
in
which
he
would
have
to
appear
where
the
balance
would
be
that
he
must
appear?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
all
you
are
asking
is,
as
i
understand
it
a
principle
which
requires
a
balance
in
which
balance
made
in
this
case,
opts
in
favor
of
affirmance
of
the
court
of
appeal,
that's
all
there
is
to
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
in
any
event
you
are
not
asking
or
suggesting
that
first
amendment
in
this
area
requires
a
prophylactic
rule?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
the
reporter
need
not,
that
even
appeal.
