mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
if
constitutional
adjudication
were
a
process
of
picking
the
general
legal
doctrine
that
fitted
a
case
most
closely
and
applying
it
mechanically
to
result
a
specific
controversy
then
the
present
case
would
involve
an
interactively
difficult
problem.
the
government
stands
on
a
categorical
imperative
that
the
grand
jury
is
entitled
every
man’s
evidence.
we
would
i
suppose
have
to
stand
on
a
categorical
imperative
with
equal
abstraction
on
the
other
side
that
government
may
not
abridge
the
freedom
of
the
press
and
the
court
would
have
to
pick
between
the
two.
of
course,
that
is
not
the
issue,
that
is
not
our
position.
but
it
is
the
government's
position
which
stands
i
think
rather
woodenly
on
a
proposition
that
whatever
protection
the
first
amendment
may
give
against
specific
questioning
by
grand
jury,
the
obligation
of
a
witness
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury
is
so
absolute,
saving
only
perhaps
the
president
of
the
united
states,
that
no
situation,
no
conflict
with
any
other
right,
however
extreme,
can
qualify
the
grand
jury’s
right
to
have
every
witness
appear
before
it.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well,
that
is
certainly
one
of
the
dangers
involved
in
his
appearance
and
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
think
his
non-appearance,
and
particularly
in
very
narrow
circumstances
of
this
case
is
not
required.
we
think
the
government's
position
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes,
but
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
mr.
justice
marshall
is
based
on
quite
a
different
footing.
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
is
based
on
the
notion
that
the
evidence
that
one
gives
may
result
in
harm
by
incrimination.
nothing
that
underlies
the
fifth
amendment
depends
on
the
effect
of
testimony
upon
one’s
relations
with
other
people.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
cannot
conceive
of
any
way
in
which
his
appearance
before
the
grand
jury
would
incur
much
harm
under
the
fifth
amendment,
let
alone
more
than
in
this
case
to
the
first.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
perhaps
i
misunderstand
the
question.
i
have
no
doubt
that
no
one
maybe
exempted
from
appearance
before
a
grand
jury,
nor
indeed
from
answering
questions,
simply
because
of
considerations
of
personal
safety.
but
in
terms
of
mr.
justice
marshall’s
question
as
to
why
one
may
compel
a
witness
to
appear
in
front
of
the
grand
jury
without
a
prejudice
for
fifth
and
i
think
your
honor's
question
in
regards
to
what
criteria
for
the
fifth
would
be
incurred,
there
is
no
criteria
to
the
the
fifth.
when
a
question
is
asked,
he
claims
it.
if
the
government
overbears
him
in
anyway
as
mr.
justice
douglas
suggested
and
the
evidence
is
sought
to
be
used
against
him,
we
have
of
course
self-incrimination
in
violation
of
the
constitution
and
it
simply
can’t
be
used.
the
fifth
amendment
in
short
is
protectable
by
the
process
of
having
to
respond
to
a
particular
question.
the
first
amendment
privilege
which
i
hope
to
develop
on
the
basis
of
the
record
here,
rested
on
very
different
footing
all
together.
it
rested
on
the
impact
of
the
interrogative
process,
on
relations
between
the
reporter
and
his
sources
which
are
not
protected
in
the
way
that
the
fifth
amendment
could
adequately
be
protected
before
the
grand
jury.
the
--
it's
our
position
that
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes,
your
honor.
i
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
nothing
is
more
important
than
life,
but
one
doesn’t
reason
back
within
the
fact
that
deprivation
of
life
maybe
involved
that
other
rights
can’t
be
taken
away
by
a
process
which
jeopardizes
specific
constitutional
guarantees.
the
question
in
this
case
we
think
is
as
the
government
has
stated
whether
or
not
mr.
caldwell
is
required
to
appear.
i
would
answer
your
honor’s
question
as
to
whether
a
witness
was
required
to
answer
any
specific
question
in
the
same
way
and
which
i
answer
the
question
whether
he
is
obliged
to
appear.
fear
for
the
safety
of
life
would
be
no
defense
to
refuse
to
answer
to
a
specific
question.
fear
for
the
safety
of
life
would
be
no
excuse
for
not
appearing
at
all.
the
government
is
drawing
a
distinction
between
appearing
and
answering
a
specific
question.
surely,
that
distinction
draws
no
sustenance
from
the
fact
that
a
grand
jury
witness
is
not
permitted
to
refuse
to
appear
because
his
life
maybe
in
jeopardy,
he
is
also
not
permitted
to
refuse
to
answer
questions
because
his
life
maybe
in
jeopardy.
that
is
i
think
a
totally
different
issue
from
the
issue
here
where
it's
not
the
witness’
right
primarily
that
is
at
stake
at
all.
what
is
primarily
involved
is
the
impact
of
the
process
of
subpoenaing
witnesses
who
are
newsmen
with
the
inevitable
effect
on
the
editorial
decisions
which
are
made,
which
i'll
come
back
to,
and
also
the
process
of
gathering
news
upon
the
free
flow
of
information
of
the
problem,
that
i
think
poses
a
totally
different
problem
than
any
question
of
personal
safety
of
any
one
particular
witness.
the
government
states
the
grand
jury’s
right
to
the
testimony
of
every
man
in
terms
which
i
think
bring
to
mind
justice
holmes’
favorite
aphorism
that
every
right
tends
to
declare
itself
absolute
to
it's
logical
extreme,
followed
of
course
by
the
observation
that
in
fact
every
right
is
not
absolute
to
it's
logical
extreme,
but
is
limited
by
the
neighborhood
of
other
principles
which
come
to
hold
water,
to
hold
their
own
against
that
right
when
a
certain
point
is
reached.
the
question
in
this
case
very
simply
is
whether
the
point
has
been
reached,
at
which
the
general
right
which
we
do
not
contest
at
all
of
a
grand
jury
to
have
the
testimony
of
every
man,
to
have
every
man
appear
is
to
be
accommodated
at
all
to
concerns
for
the
first
amendment.
we
take
a
very
different
views
from
the
government.
we
don't
stand
on
the
proposition
that
nothing
that
the
grand
jury
does
which
affects
the
first
amendment
maybe
permitted.
we
don't
take
the
position
that
the
first
amendment
is
the
end
of
the
grand
jury.
what
we
think
is
involved
is
the
accommodation
of
two
very,
very
important
concerns.
the
grand
jury’s
investigative
process
on
the
one
hand
and
the
reporter's
investigative
process
on
the
other.
and
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
properly,
again
on
the
narrow
facts
of
this
case
struck
the
balance
between
those
two
by
saying
that,
although
ordinarily
any
witness
must
appear
before
a
grand
jury,
that
in
a
case
of
reporters,
on
the
showing
made
on
this
record.
the
government
may
compel
appearance
only
by
making
a
foundation
showing
which
it
has
never
made
or
attempted
to
make
in
this
case.
well,
the
government
has
presented
the
case
in
this
court
both
in
its
brief
and
the
argument
by
taking
really
two
positions.
but,
the
one
that
most
stands
on
is
that
even
if
mr.
caldwell
has
a
right
as
a
journalist
protected
by
the
first
amendment
not
to
answer
specific
questions,
but
nevertheless
he
must
appear.
then
the
government
appears
to
take
the
position,
although
is
not
argued
separately
this
morning
in
detail
that
in
fact
the
journalist
doesn't
even
have
any
protection
against
specific
questions.
now,
that
way
of
phrasing
the
matter
kind
of
requires
me
to
argue
my
case
backwards.
i
would
like
to
start
logically
by
demonstrating
that
as
the
court
of
appeals
found
and
through
the
processes
by
which
it
found
it,
that
a
reporter
does
have
some
constitutional
protection
if
there
is
some
first
amendment
interest
implicated
and
the
subpoena-compelled
testimony
of
newsmen.
and
that,
that
first
amendment
interest
requires
some
accommodation
with
the
grand
jury
process
and
then
i
would
like
to
proceed
to
discover
what
accommodation
is
required
in
this
case.
but
since
my
argument
time
is
limited
and
there
are
two
other
cases
that
follow
this
one,
it
will
be
of
primarily
with
the
question
of
whether
the
reporter
has
any
first
amendment
protection
at
all,
i
think
i
would
like
to
start
with
the
same
position
that
the
government
took
in
this
case
and
assume
the
validity
of
judge
zirpoli's
order
and
ask
whether
if
judge
zirpoli's
order
is
proper
and
if
this
court
would
affirm
it,
mr.
caldwell
should
be
entirely
excused
from
appearing,
then
in
what
time
i
have
left
after
that
i
can
come
back,
if
i
can
and
deal
with
the
question
of
the
propriety
of
the
order.
now,
in
dealing
with
that
question
i
think
it
is
very
important
to
follow
the
course
of
litigation
in
this
case
and
the
positions
that
the
parties
have
taken
in
it.
the
litigation
began
by
the
service
of
the
subpoena
on
mr.
caldwell,
it
had
a
duces
tecum
rider
which
made
very
clear
that
he
was
to
be
questioned
about
the
black
panthers.
mr.
caldwell
filed
an
affidavit
in
support
of
a
motion
to
quash
that
subpoena
which
was
cited
that
among
other
things,
he
had
no
unpublished,
non-confidential
information
about
the
black
panthers.
i
will
read
the
specific
terms
in
that
affidavit
for
one
second,
but
first
thing
i
want
to
point
out
is
this
affidavit
was
not
filed
at
latterly
stage
of
this
proceeding
with
an
intent
to
ride
himself
into
the
protection
of
the
district
judge's
orders.
this
was
quite
at
the
very
beginning
before
everybody
had
the
faintest
idea
what
the
district
judge's
order
was
going
to
be.
and
mr.
caldwell,
the
reason
for
the
work
generally
at
the
beginning
i
should
note
of
the
quotation
i
am
going
to
read
which
mr.
griswold
is
focussed
on
is
to
explain
the
immediately
preceding
sentences
in
which
mr.
caldwell
makes
clear
that
to
write
a
panther's
function
with
the
press
doesn't
involve
an
on
the
record
off
the
record
type
of
a
thing,
it's
an
understanding
of
what
is
confidential
and
what
is
not.
it
is
in
that
context
that
he
says
generally,
those
matters
which
were
made
on
non-confidential
or
for
publication
basis
have
been
published
in
articles
i
have
written
in
the
new
york
times.
now,
we
get
to
the
converse
preposition
which
is
the
important
one
and
which
is
qualified
by
generally,
conversely
any
matters
which
i
have
not
thus
far
disclosed
in
published
articles
would
have
been
given
to
me
based
on
the
understanding,
that
they
were
confidential
and
would
not
be
published
is
a
certain
quite
categorically
that
he
does
not
have
unpublished
non
confidential
material
about
the
black
panthers.
now
the
government
putting
numerous
affidavits,
made
no
contest
on
this
point
whatsoever.
the
district
court
came
down
with
an
order
granting
mr.
caldwell
a
protection
against
specific
questioning
but
requiring
to
go
before
the
grand
jury.
during
the
course
of
proceedings
under
that
when
that
grand
jury
expired,
a
new
subpoena
was
issued,
the
government
again
had
a
full
blown
chance
to
contest
factually
the
proposition
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
later
was
to
make
its
finding
that
mr.
caldwell
had
no
unpublished
non-confidential
information
to
give
the
grand
jury.
the
government
made
no
such
showing.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
have
no
doubt
that
if
there
were
no
reason
to
give
him
protection
against
appearing
before
the
grand
jury,
that
a
perfectly
proper
place
to
explore
that
question
would
be
before
the
grand
jury.
but
where
the
claim
is
made,
as
it
was
in
this
case,
that
there
are
serious
constitutional
implications,
harms
to
the
first
amendment
of
his
very
appearance,
then
it
quietly
and
properly
inquire
i
believe
whether
there
is
anything
that
the
government
could
get
out
of
him
if
he
went
in
front
of
the
grand
jury.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well,
that
is
precisely
we
think
the
implication
of
this
court's
decisions
for
example
in
legislative
investigation
area,
that
although
government
is
at
a
disadvantage
in
starting
investigations,
it
may
not
start
them
in
a
way
that
has
a
drastic
effect
on
the
first
amendment
simply
on
speculation.
i
agree
that
in
many
cases
it
maybe
difficult
for
the
government
to
know
what
a
reporter
knows.
but,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
government
subpoenaed
this
man
for
a
reason
i
suppose.
we
think
it
is
based
in
part
on
electronic
eavesdropping,
but
the
government
says
it
subpoenaed
him
on
basis
of
his
stories.
now
if
there
were
any
evidence
in
the
stories
that
he
had
non
confidential,
unpublished
information
or
if
the
government
provide
other
information
that
we
think
it
has
about
mr.
caldwell's
communication
with
the
panthers,
there
would
be
no
difficulty
your
honors
establishing
what
the
government
thinks
that
mr.
caldwell
knows.
the
government
has
not
even
suggested
in
this
case
anything
that
maybe
non
confidential
and
mr.
caldwell
has
in
many
ways
in
which
the
government
could
go
about
making
such
a
showing
in
face
of
his
writings,
anything
that
he
had
said
outside
of
his
writings,
that
the
government
may
have
overheard
in
terms
of
his
communications
with
the
panthers
something
very
much
in
issue
in
background
of
this
case.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
mr
justice
white,
i
cannot
deny
and
do
not
deny
that
it
would
be
admissible
evidence
before
a
grand
jury
to
have
mr.
caldwell
come
in
and
authenticate
his
story,
i
do
not
deny
that.
nor
do
i
assert
is
what
he
published
was
confidential,
his
publication
of
it
makes
very
clear
that
it
was
not
confidential.
what
i
do
assert
what
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
very
plainly
believed
or
is
it
there
a
certain
implements
to
investigation
which
are
so
de
minimis,
so
marginal,
so
totally
insignificant,
that
any
significant
first
amendment
harmony
other
side
plainly
out
raged
them
in
the
same
way
in
which
the
state
cannot,
even
though
it
has
an
interest
in
prohibiting
street
littering,
it
cannot
forbid
to
giving
out
handbooks.
now
let
us
look
for
a
moment
at
what
mr.
caldwell's
authentication
of
this
article
would
tell
a
grand
jury.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well,
your
honor,
do
i
think
that
the
grand
jury
could
or
properly
should
subpoena
the
reporter?
i
think
that
if
the
reporter's
statement
describes
the
elements
of
indictable
offenses
that
the
authentication
of
the
story
would
in
many
but
not
all
cases
provide
valuable
information
for
the
grand
jury.
now
one
of
the
tests
we
propose
as
a
foundation
for
calling
a
reporter
before
the
grand
jury
is
that,
that
information
not
be
available
through
means
that
are
less
destructive
of
first
amendment
interest.
so
i
am
not
in
answering
your
honor's
question
suggesting
that
i
think
that,
that
witness
could
always
be
called,
but
it
was
there
would
be
totally
different
case
in
this
case.
because
here
what
we
have
is
authentication,
if
any,
of
a
proposition
that
david
hilliard
said
that
the
black
panthers
were
revolutionary
group
and
that
this
was
serious.
let
me
suggest
this
way,
what
that
would
add
to
the
grand
jury's
information
is
charitably
described
as
zero.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
alright
then
mr.
justice
white,
actually
approach
what
basically
is
that
that
kind
of
accommodative
judgment
is
what
the
stand
off,
if
you
will,
of
the
grand
jury
institution
embodied
in
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
first
amendment
across
the
board.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
am
sorry,
mr.
justice
marshall,
is
there
are
any
other
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh!
yes,
your
honor,
there
are
a
number
of
people
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well,
one
case
is,
for
example,
window
glass
workers
workers
case
we
cited
in
our
brief.
it's
not
a
matter
of
a
group
if
an
individual
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
would
suppose
that
there
were
constitutional
rules
and
i
think
that
the
first
amendment
might
be
one
of
them,
which
might
very
well
preclude
other
people
from
being
called
before
the
grand
jury
than
reporters.
i
think
that,
for
example,
if
the
grand
jury
called
before
it,
individuals
who
were
members
of
the
naacp
in
little
rock
that
in
particular
circumstances
with
a
particular
balancing
test,
this
court
might
very
well
find
that
the
very
appearance
of
those
people
before
the
grand
jury
was
so
destructive
of
first
amendment
interest
that
they
could
not
be
called.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
to
start
with
that
is
not
necessarily
my
point,
that
is
not
the
basis
--
is
not
the
basis
on
which
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
rests.
my
point
is
that
if
the
defendant
--
if
the
grand
jury
witness
is
so
completely
protected
by
the
protective
order
that
he
needs
to
answer
no
questions
which
could
be
of
any
use
to
the
government,
that
it
would
be
a
futile
exercise
to
make
him
appear
and
that
would
violate
the
first
amendment,
if
the
fact
of
appearance
would
have
a
significant
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
think
with
one
qualification,
again,
your
honor,
that
i
think
the
government
should
have
to
show
also
unavailability
of
equal
information
could
not
be
served,
but
if
we
put
that
one
aside,
and
i
am
willing
to
put
it
aside
because
i
don't
need
to
reach
it,
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
then
i
would
say
that
the
government
could
call
it.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
precisely.
now
your
honor,
i
think
this
is
very
important.
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
court
below
tool
this
thing
in
two
bites
and
i
would
like
to
take
it
in
two
bites
if
i
can.
bite
one
is
the
question
whether
or
not
this
witness
was
entitled
to
some
kind
of
protection
against
open-ended
questioning
before
the
grand
jury
which
might
intrude
on
first
amendment
relations.
now
we
argue
that
its
open-ended
appearance
before
the
grand
jury
would
have
a
devastating
effect
on
the
free
flow
of
information,
that's
central
to
the
first
amendment.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
on
the
narrow
facts
of
this
case,
that's
correct,
but
let
me
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that
would
meet
the
government's
burden.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no
problem
and
the
court
of
appeals
decision
leaves
that
open,
and
the
thing
that
has
been
i
think
totally
ignored
in
the
government's
argument
is
court
is
that
that
is
open.
not
only
has
the
government
at
every
opportunity
below
failed
to
claim,
that
there
weren't
any
dead
bodies
working
around
here
or
any
non-confidential
information,
but
the
court
of
appeals
sort
of
leaves
it
to
the
government
to
show
that
on
remand.
the
court
of
appeals,
the
only
holding
in
this
case
is
that
they
are
very
narrow
and
this
appears
on
page
25.
it
says
if
any
competing
public
interest
is
ever
to
arise
in
a
case
such
as
this,
that
is
any
competing
need
where
the
testimony
of
a
witness,
where
first
amendment
liberties
are
threatened
by
the
mere
appearance
at
a
grand
jury
investigation,
it
would
be
on
an
occasion
in
which
the
witness
or
in
with
his
privilege
can
still
serve
a
useful
purpose
before
the
grand
jury.
considering
the
scope
of
the
privilege
embodied
in
the
protective
order
these
occasions
would
seem
to
be
unusual.
it
is
not
asking
too
much
of
the
government
to
show
that
such
an
occasion
is
presented
here.
we
stand
or
not,
we
think
this
court
plainly
ought
to
affirm
it,
because
it's
plainly
read.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
absolutely
not.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
absolutely
not
your
honor.
we
are
seeking
to
sustain
this
decision
on
the
ground
below
that
the
witness
had
a
privilege,
embodied
in
judge
zirpoli's
order
which
would,
in
fact
have
so
totally
deprived
his
appearance
of
in
fact,
have
so
totally
deprived
his
appearance
of
meaning
that
the
residual
harm
which
would
have
been
done
to
the
first
amendment
rights
far
outweighed
the
residual
benefit
that
would
have
been
done
to
the
grand
jury's
investigative
process.
now
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it
is
not
possible
that
they
had
no
factual
basis
in
which
to
reach
it
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
i
think
first
of
all,
due
deference
to
the
court
of
appeals'
conclusion
which
stated
not
only
that
it
reached
it
on
the
basis
of
the
record,
but
that
the
government
had
not
contested
it,
would
not
permit
this
court
to
offset
the
point.
we
would
be
satisfied
but
i
think
it
would
be
inappropriate
for
the
court
to
offset
it
because
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment
allows
the
matter
to
be
litigated
by
the
government
in
the
district
court
where
it
can
be
far
better
litigated
than
by
inferences
such
as
what
the
word
generally
means
on
a
court
record
in
this
court.
now
my
time
is
so
close
to
running,
and
i
would
just
like
to
spend
a
minute
or
two
more
on
why
i
think
the
residual
harm
of
mere
appearance
in
this
case
does
outweigh
the
residual
benefit
of
mere,
for
example,
authentication
of
the
article.
the
government
is
wrong
in
its
assertion
that
only
one,
i
think
it
said
here,
two
in
its
brief,
that
the
reporters
below
claimed
that
mere
appearance
would
have
a
devastating
effect
on
first
amendment
rights.
in
fact,
there
are
six
reporters
who
said
this.
the
pages
in
the
record
cited
in
the
footnote
on
page
53
of
our
brief
will
give
the
court
those
page
references.
the
government
has
also
made
some
reference
to
professor
blasi's
study.
there
are
several
things
that
ought
to
be
said
about
professor
blasi's
study
and
not
the
least
of
which
appears
on
page
69
of
it
nothing
in
the
opinion
of
every
reporter
with
whom
i
discussed
the
matter,
would
be
more
damaging
to
source
relationships
in
a
supreme
court
reversal
of
the
ninth
circuit's
caldwell
holding.
several
newsmen
told
me
initially
they
were
extremely
worried
by
the
subpoena
spread
three
years
ago,
but
now
their
anxieties
have
greatly
subsided
as
a
result
of
the
strong
stand
taken
by
the
journalism
profession,
and
their
tentative
victories
in
court.
however,
a
supreme
court
declaration
of
the
first
amendment
is
in
no
ways
abridged
by
the
practice
of
subpoenaing
reporters
would
be
administered
set
off
a
way
that
anxiety
among
sources
but
[voice
overlap]
holding
would
---
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
have
the
full
scale
study,
i
believe
that
these
are
available
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
page
69,
it
is
at
footnote,
if
the
footnote
is
the
same,
it
would
be
footnote
215
in
that
area.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
next
point
that
i
want
to
make
about
the
blasi's
study,
i
think
demonstrates
importance
of
not
litigating
fact
questions
in
this
court,
but
rather
sticking
to
the
record
which
i
think
is
very
clear
on
such
questions,
the
source
reliance
and
chilling
effect.
the
government
has
mentioned
a
fact
that
8%
of
reporters
say
that
in
he
last
18
months
they
had
not
been
affected
by
the
subpoena
controversy.
the
blasi
study
nowhere
says
when
the
reporters
were
asked
that
question
and
when
answered
it.
in
fact,
the
questionnaire
went
out
in
the
third
week
of
july
of
1971
and
answers
were
tabulated
until
october
28,
1971.
eighteen-and-one-half
months
after
the
caldwell
decision
by
the
district
court.
the
caldwell
decision
by
the
district
court
had
been
given
very
wide
publicity,
as
giving
newsman
a
general
protection.
it
as
professor
blasi
says
on
page
68
of
this
document,
clear
to
the
error
and
it's
perfectly
understandable
and
relatively
to
few
reporters
would
have
been
affected
in
the
period
of
18
months
following
that
decision
by
the
fears
which
it
is
a
very
purpose
of
this
litigation
for
late
arrest.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
if
constitutional
adjudication
were
a
process
of
picking
the
general
legal
doctrine
that
fitted
a
case
most
closely
and
applying
it
mechanically
to
result
a
specific
controversy
then
the
present
case
would
involve
an
interactively
difficult
problem.
the
government
stands
on
a
categorical
imperative
that
the
grand
jury
is
entitled
every
man’s
evidence.
we
would
i
suppose
have
to
stand
on
a
categorical
imperative
with
equal
abstraction
on
the
other
side
that
government
may
not
abridge
the
freedom
of
the
press
and
the
court
would
have
to
pick
between
the
two.
of
course,
that
is
not
the
issue,
that
is
not
our
position.
but
it
is
the
government's
position
which
stands
i
think
rather
woodenly
on
a
proposition
that
whatever
protection
the
first
amendment
may
give
against
specific
questioning
by
grand
jury,
the
obligation
of
a
witness
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury
is
so
absolute,
saving
only
perhaps
the
president
of
the
united
states,
that
no
situation,
no
conflict
with
any
other
right,
however
extreme,
can
qualify
the
grand
jury’s
right
to
have
every
witness
appear
before
it.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well,
that
is
certainly
one
of
the
dangers
involved
in
his
appearance
and
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
think
his
non-appearance,
and
particularly
in
very
narrow
circumstances
of
this
case
is
not
required.
we
think
the
government's
position
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes,
but
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
mr.
justice
marshall
is
based
on
quite
a
different
footing.
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
is
based
on
the
notion
that
the
evidence
that
one
gives
may
result
in
harm
by
incrimination.
nothing
that
underlies
the
fifth
amendment
depends
on
the
effect
of
testimony
upon
one’s
relations
with
other
people.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
cannot
conceive
of
any
way
in
which
his
appearance
before
the
grand
jury
would
incur
much
harm
under
the
fifth
amendment,
let
alone
more
than
in
this
case
to
the
first.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
perhaps
i
misunderstand
the
question.
i
have
no
doubt
that
no
one
maybe
exempted
from
appearance
before
a
grand
jury,
nor
indeed
from
answering
questions,
simply
because
of
considerations
of
personal
safety.
but
in
terms
of
mr.
justice
marshall’s
question
as
to
why
one
may
compel
a
witness
to
appear
in
front
of
the
grand
jury
without
a
prejudice
for
fifth
and
i
think
your
honor's
question
in
regards
to
what
criteria
for
the
fifth
would
be
incurred,
there
is
no
criteria
to
the
the
fifth.
when
a
question
is
asked,
he
claims
it.
if
the
government
overbears
him
in
anyway
as
mr.
justice
douglas
suggested
and
the
evidence
is
sought
to
be
used
against
him,
we
have
of
course
self-incrimination
in
violation
of
the
constitution
and
it
simply
can’t
be
used.
the
fifth
amendment
in
short
is
protectable
by
the
process
of
having
to
respond
to
a
particular
question.
the
first
amendment
privilege
which
i
hope
to
develop
on
the
basis
of
the
record
here,
rested
on
very
different
footing
all
together.
it
rested
on
the
impact
of
the
interrogative
process,
on
relations
between
the
reporter
and
his
sources
which
are
not
protected
in
the
way
that
the
fifth
amendment
could
adequately
be
protected
before
the
grand
jury.
the
--
it's
our
position
that
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes,
your
honor.
i
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
nothing
is
more
important
than
life,
but
one
doesn’t
reason
back
within
the
fact
that
deprivation
of
life
maybe
involved
that
other
rights
can’t
be
taken
away
by
a
process
which
jeopardizes
specific
constitutional
guarantees.
the
question
in
this
case
we
think
is
as
the
government
has
stated
whether
or
not
mr.
caldwell
is
required
to
appear.
i
would
answer
your
honor’s
question
as
to
whether
a
witness
was
required
to
answer
any
specific
question
in
the
same
way
and
which
i
answer
the
question
whether
he
is
obliged
to
appear.
fear
for
the
safety
of
life
would
be
no
defense
to
refuse
to
answer
to
a
specific
question.
fear
for
the
safety
of
life
would
be
no
excuse
for
not
appearing
at
all.
the
government
is
drawing
a
distinction
between
appearing
and
answering
a
specific
question.
surely,
that
distinction
draws
no
sustenance
from
the
fact
that
a
grand
jury
witness
is
not
permitted
to
refuse
to
appear
because
his
life
maybe
in
jeopardy,
he
is
also
not
permitted
to
refuse
to
answer
questions
because
his
life
maybe
in
jeopardy.
that
is
i
think
a
totally
different
issue
from
the
issue
here
where
it's
not
the
witness’
right
primarily
that
is
at
stake
at
all.
what
is
primarily
involved
is
the
impact
of
the
process
of
subpoenaing
witnesses
who
are
newsmen
with
the
inevitable
effect
on
the
editorial
decisions
which
are
made,
which
i'll
come
back
to,
and
also
the
process
of
gathering
news
upon
the
free
flow
of
information
of
the
problem,
that
i
think
poses
a
totally
different
problem
than
any
question
of
personal
safety
of
any
one
particular
witness.
the
government
states
the
grand
jury’s
right
to
the
testimony
of
every
man
in
terms
which
i
think
bring
to
mind
justice
holmes’
favorite
aphorism
that
every
right
tends
to
declare
itself
absolute
to
it's
logical
extreme,
followed
of
course
by
the
observation
that
in
fact
every
right
is
not
absolute
to
it's
logical
extreme,
but
is
limited
by
the
neighborhood
of
other
principles
which
come
to
hold
water,
to
hold
their
own
against
that
right
when
a
certain
point
is
reached.
the
question
in
this
case
very
simply
is
whether
the
point
has
been
reached,
at
which
the
general
right
which
we
do
not
contest
at
all
of
a
grand
jury
to
have
the
testimony
of
every
man,
to
have
every
man
appear
is
to
be
accommodated
at
all
to
concerns
for
the
first
amendment.
we
take
a
very
different
views
from
the
government.
we
don't
stand
on
the
proposition
that
nothing
that
the
grand
jury
does
which
affects
the
first
amendment
maybe
permitted.
we
don't
take
the
position
that
the
first
amendment
is
the
end
of
the
grand
jury.
what
we
think
is
involved
is
the
accommodation
of
two
very,
very
important
concerns.
the
grand
jury’s
investigative
process
on
the
one
hand
and
the
reporter's
investigative
process
on
the
other.
and
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
properly,
again
on
the
narrow
facts
of
this
case
struck
the
balance
between
those
two
by
saying
that,
although
ordinarily
any
witness
must
appear
before
a
grand
jury,
that
in
a
case
of
reporters,
on
the
showing
made
on
this
record.
the
government
may
compel
appearance
only
by
making
a
foundation
showing
which
it
has
never
made
or
attempted
to
make
in
this
case.
well,
the
government
has
presented
the
case
in
this
court
both
in
its
brief
and
the
argument
by
taking
really
two
positions.
but,
the
one
that
most
stands
on
is
that
even
if
mr.
caldwell
has
a
right
as
a
journalist
protected
by
the
first
amendment
not
to
answer
specific
questions,
but
nevertheless
he
must
appear.
then
the
government
appears
to
take
the
position,
although
is
not
argued
separately
this
morning
in
detail
that
in
fact
the
journalist
doesn't
even
have
any
protection
against
specific
questions.
now,
that
way
of
phrasing
the
matter
kind
of
requires
me
to
argue
my
case
backwards.
i
would
like
to
start
logically
by
demonstrating
that
as
the
court
of
appeals
found
and
through
the
processes
by
which
it
found
it,
that
a
reporter
does
have
some
constitutional
protection
if
there
is
some
first
amendment
interest
implicated
and
the
subpoena-compelled
testimony
of
newsmen.
and
that,
that
first
amendment
interest
requires
some
accommodation
with
the
grand
jury
process
and
then
i
would
like
to
proceed
to
discover
what
accommodation
is
required
in
this
case.
but
since
my
argument
time
is
limited
and
there
are
two
other
cases
that
follow
this
one,
it
will
be
of
primarily
with
the
question
of
whether
the
reporter
has
any
first
amendment
protection
at
all,
i
think
i
would
like
to
start
with
the
same
position
that
the
government
took
in
this
case
and
assume
the
validity
of
judge
zirpoli's
order
and
ask
whether
if
judge
zirpoli's
order
is
proper
and
if
this
court
would
affirm
it,
mr.
caldwell
should
be
entirely
excused
from
appearing,
then
in
what
time
i
have
left
after
that
i
can
come
back,
if
i
can
and
deal
with
the
question
of
the
propriety
of
the
order.
now,
in
dealing
with
that
question
i
think
it
is
very
important
to
follow
the
course
of
litigation
in
this
case
and
the
positions
that
the
parties
have
taken
in
it.
the
litigation
began
by
the
service
of
the
subpoena
on
mr.
caldwell,
it
had
a
duces
tecum
rider
which
made
very
clear
that
he
was
to
be
questioned
about
the
black
panthers.
mr.
caldwell
filed
an
affidavit
in
support
of
a
motion
to
quash
that
subpoena
which
was
cited
that
among
other
things,
he
had
no
unpublished,
non-confidential
information
about
the
black
panthers.
i
will
read
the
specific
terms
in
that
affidavit
for
one
second,
but
first
thing
i
want
to
point
out
is
this
affidavit
was
not
filed
at
latterly
stage
of
this
proceeding
with
an
intent
to
ride
himself
into
the
protection
of
the
district
judge's
orders.
this
was
quite
at
the
very
beginning
before
everybody
had
the
faintest
idea
what
the
district
judge's
order
was
going
to
be.
and
mr.
caldwell,
the
reason
for
the
work
generally
at
the
beginning
i
should
note
of
the
quotation
i
am
going
to
read
which
mr.
griswold
is
focussed
on
is
to
explain
the
immediately
preceding
sentences
in
which
mr.
caldwell
makes
clear
that
to
write
a
panther's
function
with
the
press
doesn't
involve
an
on
the
record
off
the
record
type
of
a
thing,
it's
an
understanding
of
what
is
confidential
and
what
is
not.
it
is
in
that
context
that
he
says
generally,
those
matters
which
were
made
on
non-confidential
or
for
publication
basis
have
been
published
in
articles
i
have
written
in
the
new
york
times.
now,
we
get
to
the
converse
preposition
which
is
the
important
one
and
which
is
qualified
by
generally,
conversely
any
matters
which
i
have
not
thus
far
disclosed
in
published
articles
would
have
been
given
to
me
based
on
the
understanding,
that
they
were
confidential
and
would
not
be
published
is
a
certain
quite
categorically
that
he
does
not
have
unpublished
non
confidential
material
about
the
black
panthers.
now
the
government
putting
numerous
affidavits,
made
no
contest
on
this
point
whatsoever.
the
district
court
came
down
with
an
order
granting
mr.
caldwell
a
protection
against
specific
questioning
but
requiring
to
go
before
the
grand
jury.
during
the
course
of
proceedings
under
that
when
that
grand
jury
expired,
a
new
subpoena
was
issued,
the
government
again
had
a
full
blown
chance
to
contest
factually
the
proposition
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
later
was
to
make
its
finding
that
mr.
caldwell
had
no
unpublished
non-confidential
information
to
give
the
grand
jury.
the
government
made
no
such
showing.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
have
no
doubt
that
if
there
were
no
reason
to
give
him
protection
against
appearing
before
the
grand
jury,
that
a
perfectly
proper
place
to
explore
that
question
would
be
before
the
grand
jury.
but
where
the
claim
is
made,
as
it
was
in
this
case,
that
there
are
serious
constitutional
implications,
harms
to
the
first
amendment
of
his
very
appearance,
then
it
quietly
and
properly
inquire
i
believe
whether
there
is
anything
that
the
government
could
get
out
of
him
if
he
went
in
front
of
the
grand
jury.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well,
that
is
precisely
we
think
the
implication
of
this
court's
decisions
for
example
in
legislative
investigation
area,
that
although
government
is
at
a
disadvantage
in
starting
investigations,
it
may
not
start
them
in
a
way
that
has
a
drastic
effect
on
the
first
amendment
simply
on
speculation.
i
agree
that
in
many
cases
it
maybe
difficult
for
the
government
to
know
what
a
reporter
knows.
but,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
government
subpoenaed
this
man
for
a
reason
i
suppose.
we
think
it
is
based
in
part
on
electronic
eavesdropping,
but
the
government
says
it
subpoenaed
him
on
basis
of
his
stories.
now
if
there
were
any
evidence
in
the
stories
that
he
had
non
confidential,
unpublished
information
or
if
the
government
provide
other
information
that
we
think
it
has
about
mr.
caldwell's
communication
with
the
panthers,
there
would
be
no
difficulty
your
honors
establishing
what
the
government
thinks
that
mr.
caldwell
knows.
the
government
has
not
even
suggested
in
this
case
anything
that
maybe
non
confidential
and
mr.
caldwell
has
in
many
ways
in
which
the
government
could
go
about
making
such
a
showing
in
face
of
his
writings,
anything
that
he
had
said
outside
of
his
writings,
that
the
government
may
have
overheard
in
terms
of
his
communications
with
the
panthers
something
very
much
in
issue
in
background
of
this
case.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
mr
justice
white,
i
cannot
deny
and
do
not
deny
that
it
would
be
admissible
evidence
before
a
grand
jury
to
have
mr.
caldwell
come
in
and
authenticate
his
story,
i
do
not
deny
that.
nor
do
i
assert
is
what
he
published
was
confidential,
his
publication
of
it
makes
very
clear
that
it
was
not
confidential.
what
i
do
assert
what
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
very
plainly
believed
or
is
it
there
a
certain
implements
to
investigation
which
are
so
de
minimis,
so
marginal,
so
totally
insignificant,
that
any
significant
first
amendment
harmony
other
side
plainly
out
raged
them
in
the
same
way
in
which
the
state
cannot,
even
though
it
has
an
interest
in
prohibiting
street
littering,
it
cannot
forbid
to
giving
out
handbooks.
now
let
us
look
for
a
moment
at
what
mr.
caldwell's
authentication
of
this
article
would
tell
a
grand
jury.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well,
your
honor,
do
i
think
that
the
grand
jury
could
or
properly
should
subpoena
the
reporter?
i
think
that
if
the
reporter's
statement
describes
the
elements
of
indictable
offenses
that
the
authentication
of
the
story
would
in
many
but
not
all
cases
provide
valuable
information
for
the
grand
jury.
now
one
of
the
tests
we
propose
as
a
foundation
for
calling
a
reporter
before
the
grand
jury
is
that,
that
information
not
be
available
through
means
that
are
less
destructive
of
first
amendment
interest.
so
i
am
not
in
answering
your
honor's
question
suggesting
that
i
think
that,
that
witness
could
always
be
called,
but
it
was
there
would
be
totally
different
case
in
this
case.
because
here
what
we
have
is
authentication,
if
any,
of
a
proposition
that
david
hilliard
said
that
the
black
panthers
were
revolutionary
group
and
that
this
was
serious.
let
me
suggest
this
way,
what
that
would
add
to
the
grand
jury's
information
is
charitably
described
as
zero.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
alright
then
mr.
justice
white,
actually
approach
what
basically
is
that
that
kind
of
accommodative
judgment
is
what
the
stand
off,
if
you
will,
of
the
grand
jury
institution
embodied
in
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
first
amendment
across
the
board.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
am
sorry,
mr.
justice
marshall,
is
there
are
any
other
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh!
yes,
your
honor,
there
are
a
number
of
people
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well,
one
case
is,
for
example,
window
glass
workers
workers
case
we
cited
in
our
brief.
it's
not
a
matter
of
a
group
if
an
individual
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
would
suppose
that
there
were
constitutional
rules
and
i
think
that
the
first
amendment
might
be
one
of
them,
which
might
very
well
preclude
other
people
from
being
called
before
the
grand
jury
than
reporters.
i
think
that,
for
example,
if
the
grand
jury
called
before
it,
individuals
who
were
members
of
the
naacp
in
little
rock
that
in
particular
circumstances
with
a
particular
balancing
test,
this
court
might
very
well
find
that
the
very
appearance
of
those
people
before
the
grand
jury
was
so
destructive
of
first
amendment
interest
that
they
could
not
be
called.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
to
start
with
that
is
not
necessarily
my
point,
that
is
not
the
basis
--
is
not
the
basis
on
which
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
rests.
my
point
is
that
if
the
defendant
--
if
the
grand
jury
witness
is
so
completely
protected
by
the
protective
order
that
he
needs
to
answer
no
questions
which
could
be
of
any
use
to
the
government,
that
it
would
be
a
futile
exercise
to
make
him
appear
and
that
would
violate
the
first
amendment,
if
the
fact
of
appearance
would
have
a
significant
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
think
with
one
qualification,
again,
your
honor,
that
i
think
the
government
should
have
to
show
also
unavailability
of
equal
information
could
not
be
served,
but
if
we
put
that
one
aside,
and
i
am
willing
to
put
it
aside
because
i
don't
need
to
reach
it,
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
then
i
would
say
that
the
government
could
call
it.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
precisely.
now
your
honor,
i
think
this
is
very
important.
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
court
below
tool
this
thing
in
two
bites
and
i
would
like
to
take
it
in
two
bites
if
i
can.
bite
one
is
the
question
whether
or
not
this
witness
was
entitled
to
some
kind
of
protection
against
open-ended
questioning
before
the
grand
jury
which
might
intrude
on
first
amendment
relations.
now
we
argue
that
its
open-ended
appearance
before
the
grand
jury
would
have
a
devastating
effect
on
the
free
flow
of
information,
that's
central
to
the
first
amendment.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
on
the
narrow
facts
of
this
case,
that's
correct,
but
let
me
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that
would
meet
the
government's
burden.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no
problem
and
the
court
of
appeals
decision
leaves
that
open,
and
the
thing
that
has
been
i
think
totally
ignored
in
the
government's
argument
is
court
is
that
that
is
open.
not
only
has
the
government
at
every
opportunity
below
failed
to
claim,
that
there
weren't
any
dead
bodies
working
around
here
or
any
non-confidential
information,
but
the
court
of
appeals
sort
of
leaves
it
to
the
government
to
show
that
on
remand.
the
court
of
appeals,
the
only
holding
in
this
case
is
that
they
are
very
narrow
and
this
appears
on
page
25.
it
says
if
any
competing
public
interest
is
ever
to
arise
in
a
case
such
as
this,
that
is
any
competing
need
where
the
testimony
of
a
witness,
where
first
amendment
liberties
are
threatened
by
the
mere
appearance
at
a
grand
jury
investigation,
it
would
be
on
an
occasion
in
which
the
witness
or
in
with
his
privilege
can
still
serve
a
useful
purpose
before
the
grand
jury.
considering
the
scope
of
the
privilege
embodied
in
the
protective
order
these
occasions
would
seem
to
be
unusual.
it
is
not
asking
too
much
of
the
government
to
show
that
such
an
occasion
is
presented
here.
we
stand
or
not,
we
think
this
court
plainly
ought
to
affirm
it,
because
it's
plainly
read.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
absolutely
not.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
absolutely
not
your
honor.
we
are
seeking
to
sustain
this
decision
on
the
ground
below
that
the
witness
had
a
privilege,
embodied
in
judge
zirpoli's
order
which
would,
in
fact
have
so
totally
deprived
his
appearance
of
in
fact,
have
so
totally
deprived
his
appearance
of
meaning
that
the
residual
harm
which
would
have
been
done
to
the
first
amendment
rights
far
outweighed
the
residual
benefit
that
would
have
been
done
to
the
grand
jury's
investigative
process.
now
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it
is
not
possible
that
they
had
no
factual
basis
in
which
to
reach
it
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
i
think
first
of
all,
due
deference
to
the
court
of
appeals'
conclusion
which
stated
not
only
that
it
reached
it
on
the
basis
of
the
record,
but
that
the
government
had
not
contested
it,
would
not
permit
this
court
to
offset
the
point.
we
would
be
satisfied
but
i
think
it
would
be
inappropriate
for
the
court
to
offset
it
because
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment
allows
the
matter
to
be
litigated
by
the
government
in
the
district
court
where
it
can
be
far
better
litigated
than
by
inferences
such
as
what
the
word
generally
means
on
a
court
record
in
this
court.
now
my
time
is
so
close
to
running,
and
i
would
just
like
to
spend
a
minute
or
two
more
on
why
i
think
the
residual
harm
of
mere
appearance
in
this
case
does
outweigh
the
residual
benefit
of
mere,
for
example,
authentication
of
the
article.
the
government
is
wrong
in
its
assertion
that
only
one,
i
think
it
said
here,
two
in
its
brief,
that
the
reporters
below
claimed
that
mere
appearance
would
have
a
devastating
effect
on
first
amendment
rights.
in
fact,
there
are
six
reporters
who
said
this.
the
pages
in
the
record
cited
in
the
footnote
on
page
53
of
our
brief
will
give
the
court
those
page
references.
the
government
has
also
made
some
reference
to
professor
blasi's
study.
there
are
several
things
that
ought
to
be
said
about
professor
blasi's
study
and
not
the
least
of
which
appears
on
page
69
of
it
nothing
in
the
opinion
of
every
reporter
with
whom
i
discussed
the
matter,
would
be
more
damaging
to
source
relationships
in
a
supreme
court
reversal
of
the
ninth
circuit's
caldwell
holding.
several
newsmen
told
me
initially
they
were
extremely
worried
by
the
subpoena
spread
three
years
ago,
but
now
their
anxieties
have
greatly
subsided
as
a
result
of
the
strong
stand
taken
by
the
journalism
profession,
and
their
tentative
victories
in
court.
however,
a
supreme
court
declaration
of
the
first
amendment
is
in
no
ways
abridged
by
the
practice
of
subpoenaing
reporters
would
be
administered
set
off
a
way
that
anxiety
among
sources
but
[voice
overlap]
holding
would
---
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
have
the
full
scale
study,
i
believe
that
these
are
available
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
page
69,
it
is
at
footnote,
if
the
footnote
is
the
same,
it
would
be
footnote
215
in
that
area.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
next
point
that
i
want
to
make
about
the
blasi's
study,
i
think
demonstrates
importance
of
not
litigating
fact
questions
in
this
court,
but
rather
sticking
to
the
record
which
i
think
is
very
clear
on
such
questions,
the
source
reliance
and
chilling
effect.
the
government
has
mentioned
a
fact
that
8%
of
reporters
say
that
in
he
last
18
months
they
had
not
been
affected
by
the
subpoena
controversy.
the
blasi
study
nowhere
says
when
the
reporters
were
asked
that
question
and
when
answered
it.
in
fact,
the
questionnaire
went
out
in
the
third
week
of
july
of
1971
and
answers
were
tabulated
until
october
28,
1971.
eighteen-and-one-half
months
after
the
caldwell
decision
by
the
district
court.
the
caldwell
decision
