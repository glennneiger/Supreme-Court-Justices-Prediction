mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
question
raised
relates
to
the
obligation
of
a
newspaperman
to
appear
before
a
grand
jury.
the
court
below
held
that
he
need
not
even
appear.
we
think
that
decision
was
wrong,
and
that
it
goes
far
beyond
anything
that
can
be
found
in
the
words
of
the
first
amendment,
and
beyond
anything
that
can
fairly
or
properly
be
implied
from
that
provision.
the
case
arises
in
this
setting.
in
november
1969,
david
hilliard,
the
chief
of
staff
of
the
black
panther
party,
stated
publicly
in
a
speech,
“we
will
kill
richard
nixon.”
this
speech
was
televised
live,
and
rebroadcast
over
many
stations.
as
a
result
hilliard
was
indicted
in
december
1969,
charged
with
making
threats
against
the
life
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
contrary
to
section
871
of
title
18
of
the
united
states
code.
the
threat
was
repeated
in
three
subsequent
issues
of
the
weekly
periodical
called
'the
black
panther.
'
numerous
public
statements
of
a
similar
nature
were
reported
as
being
made
during
the
same
period
by
members
or
friends
of
the
black
panther
party
in
various
parts
of
the
country.
the
respondent
in
this
case,
mr.
caldwell,
is
a
newspaper
man,
employed
by
the
new
york
times.
he
wrote
a
series
of
articles
about
the
black
panther
party,
three
of
which
appear
in
the
printed
record.
one
of
these
was
published
in
the
new
york
times
on
december
14,
1969.
it
appears
in
full
at
pages
11
to
16,
of
the
appendix.
in
this
article,
the
respondent
reported
on
a
conversation
he
had
with
hilliard
and
others
at
the
panther's
headquarters
in
berkeley
california.
he
quoted
hilliard
as
making
the
following
statement,
and
this
appears
on
page
13
of
the
record.
“we
are
special,”
mr.
hilliard
said
recently,
“we
advocate
the
very
direct
overthrow
of
the
government
by
way
of
force
and
violence,
by
picking
up
guns
and
moving
against
it
because
we
recognize
it
as
being
oppressive
and
in
recognizing
that
we
know
that
the
only
solution
to
it
is
armed
struggle.”
and
then
mr.
caldwell
went
to
say
in
the
article,
"in
their
role
as
the
vanguard
in
a
revolutionary
struggle,
the
panthers
have
picked
up
guns.”
some
weeks
after
the
publication
of
this
article,
the
first
subpoena
was
issued
to
mr.
caldwell,
on
january
30,
1970.
this
was
a
subpoena
duces
tecum.
it
appears
on
page
20
of
the
appendix,
but
it
was
not
pressed
and
it
is
now
involved
in
this
case.
the
second
subpoena
was
issued
on
march
15,
1970,
it
appears
on
page
21
of
the
appendix.
it
is
a
subpoena
to
testify
only.
most
of
the
proceedings
in
the
district
court
were
taken
with
respect
to
it,
but
the
grand
jury
to
which
that
subpoena
was
returnable,
expired
early
in
may,
1970.
a
new
grand
jury
was
in
empaneled
and
a
new
subpoena,
the
third
subpoena
was
served
on
may
22,
1970.
it's
that
subpoena
which
is
involved
here.
the
decision
of
the
district
court
related
to
it,
but
by
order
of
the
district
court,
the
proceedings
relating
to
the
earlier
subpoena
were
incorporated
into
these
proceedings,
and
therefore,
we
refer
to
one
or
the
other
interchangeably.
a
motion
was
filed
to
quash
the
may
22,
subpoena,
it
appears
on
pages
98,
99
of
the
appendix.
it
states,
the
grounds
of
this
motion
are
identical
to
the
grounds
of
(inaudible)
motion
to
quash
grand
jury
subpoenas
filed
march
17,
1970,
and
it
was
with
respect
to
the
earlier
motion
to
quash
that
mr.
amsterdam
stated,
and
this
is
on
page
36
of
the
appendix,
right
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
the
essential
claim
of
the
motion
to
quash
is
that
mr.
caldwell's
very
appearance
before
the
grand
jury
under
the
broad
terms
of
these
subpoenas
will
irreparably
breached
and
damage
associations
and
means
of
freedom
of
speech
and
of
the
press,
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
the
district
court,
judge
zirpoli
in
the
northern
district
of
california,
denied
the
motion
to
quash
and
directed
the
respondent
to
appear,
but
subject
to
very
specific
conditions.
the
district
court's
order
of
april
7
which
was
where
he
made
the
determination,
appears
at
pages
94–97
of
the
appendix,
and
the
corresponding
order
of
june
4
appears
at
pages
104
and
105
of
the
appendix.
the
relevant
portion
of
the
order
actually
involved
is
on
page
105
and
it
reads
as
follows.
it
is
hereby
ordered
that
earl
caldwell
is
directed
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury
pursuant
to
the
subpoena
of
may
22,
1970
and
in
so
doing,
he
shall
not
be
required
to
reveal
confidential
associations,
sources,
or
information
received,
developed,
or
maintained
by
him
as
a
professional
journalist
in
the
course
of
his
efforts
to
gather
news
for
dissemination
to
the
public
through
the
press
or
other
news
media.
two,
that
specifically
without
limiting
paragraph
one,
mr.
caldwell
shall
not
be
required
to
answer
questions,
concerning
statements
made
to
him,
or
information
given
to
him
by
members
of
the
black
panther
party,
unless
such
statements
or
information
were
given
to
him
for
public
information,
for
publication
or
public
disclosure.
and
third,
that
to
assure
the
effectuation
of
this
order
mr.
caldwell
shall
be
permitted
to
consult
with
his
counsel
at
anytime
he
wishes
during
the
course
of
his
appearance
before
the
grand
jury.
thus,
the
issue
here
is
an
exceedingly
narrower.
the
respondent
has
been
granted
protection
against
revealing
confidential
sources
and
confidential
statements.
the
government
did
not
appeal
from
that
part
of
judge
zirpoli's
order
and
this
was
partly
because
we
did
not
think
that
it
was
appealable.
it
is
clear,
however,
that
these
limitations
are
in
no
way
at
issue
here.
the
only
issue
here
is
that
expressed
in
mr.
amsterdam's
words,
in
the
show
cause
hearing
before
judge
zirpoli,
when
he
said
and
this
appears
on
page
108
of
the
appendix
in
the
transcript
of
the
hearing
before
judge
zirpoli
just
below
the
middle
of
the
page.
the
only
cause
which
we
have
to
show
is
that
mr.
caldwell
has
a
constitutional
right
not
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury.
”
the
court
of
appeals
below
sustained
this
contention
in
it's
entirety
and
held
that
the
respondent
need
not
even
appear
before
the
grand
jury
and
despite
the
broad
protection
which
has
been
afforded
to
him
by
the
district
court's
order.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
that,
that
is
perhaps
an
appropriate
interpretation
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
it
is
exemplified
at
page
125
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
now
appellant
asserted
in
affidavit
that
there
is
nothing
to
which
he
could
testify
beyond
that
which
he
has
already
made
public
and
for
which
therefore,
his
appearance
is
unnecessary
and
i
question
whether
his
appearance
is
unnecessary
just
because
it
appears
in
an
article,
there
is
some
difference
between
testimony
under
oath
and
a
newspaper
article
that
is
not
protected
by
the
district
court's
order.
this
is
a
rather
definitive
and
positive
statement,
but
i
think
its
basis
in
the
record
is
(inaudible)
and
unattenuated.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
but
this
particular
statement
can
rest
only
on
the
affidavit
of
earl
caldwell
which
appears
at
pages
17-19
of
the
appendix.
this
is
an
affidavit
intended
to
be
self-serving
and
without
any
executors
and
of
course
without
cross
examination
and
the
only
passage
in
the
affidavit
which
bears
any
relation
to
this
is
on
page
18
of
the
appendix
about
two
inches
above
the
bottom
of
the
page
where
mr.
caldwell
said,
“generally”
and
generally
certainly
leaves
quite
a
lot
of
room
for
discussion.
“generally,
those
matters
which
were
made
on
a
confidential
or
on
a
non-confidential
or
for
publication
basis
have
been
published
in
articles
i
have
written
in
'the
new
york
times.'
conversely
any
matters
which
i
have
not
thus
far
disclosed
in
published
articles
would
have
been
given
to
me
based
on
the
understanding
that
they
were
confidential
and
would
not
be
published.
”well,
in
the
first
place
what
that
word
generally
covers,
what
the
exceptions
maybe
because
obviously
when
you
say
generally,
you
recognize
that
there
are
exceptions,
does
not
in
any
way
appear
and
it
is
surely
a
legitimate
subject
of
inquiry
but
there
other
aspects
of
the
matter.
mr.
hilliard
has
quoted
in
the
article
written
by
the
respondent.
that
certainly
is
no
longer
confidential.
what
were
the
circumstances
in
which
it
was
said?
was
it
after
an
evening
of
drinks
when
people
were
talking
pretty
freely
and
loosely?
was
it
puffing
or
boosting
as
a
means
of
attracting
attention?
could
it
had
been
said
in
jest?
the
government
and
the
grand
jury
are
as
much
interested
in
establishing
the
innocence
of
mr.
hillard
as
in
getting
a
further
indictment
against
him.
this
has
not
begun
to
cover
the
field
of
questions
which
an
experienced
examiner
could
direct
his
respondent
within
the
limitations
imposed
by
the
district
court.
but
it
isn't
sufficient
it
seems
to
me
to
show
that
this
key
statement
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
has
no
adequate
foundation
in
the
record.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
know
what
it
is
meant
by
the
government
apparently
has
not
believed
it
necessary
to
dispute
it
as
disputed
it
in
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
consistently
all
the
way
along.
it
disputed
it
and
counter
affidavits
before
judge
zirpoli,
it
disputed
it
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
it
is
trying
to
dispute
it
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
if
the
court
of
appeals
believed
that,
it
was
against
every
effort
made
to
disabuse
with
such
a
belief.
the
government
has
accepted
the
restriction
as
i
believe
it
had
to,
i
don't
think
it
had
any
choice.
conceivably
we
could
have
sought
mandamus
to
compel
the
judge
to
remove
this
restriction.
that
would
have
involved
long
delays
which
at
that
time
we
were
anxious
to
avoid
and
we
did
not
foresee
the
long
delay
which
had
occurred.
we
thought
that
the
court
of
appeals
would
decide
the
case
the
other
way
and
we
could
get
on
with
the
inquiry.
we
felt
that
the
order,
that
the
limitation
was
not
appealable
and
that
in
our
judgment
discretion
it
was
not
wise
to
seek
a
review
of
it
by
a
mandamus,
but
it
by
no
means
follows
that
we
accepted
it,
thought
it
was
correct,
thought
that
it
was
warranted
or
indeed
that
it
completely
foreclosed
any
possible
inquiry
of
mr.
caldwell
before
the
grand
jury.
i
believe
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
he
need
not
even
appear
is
unprecedented.
i
know
of
no
other
decision
that
is
held
with
a
newsman
or
any
other
person
need
not
appear
before
a
grand
jury.
i
suppose
that
everyone
in
the
country
except,
the
president
of
the
united
states,
was
amenable
to
subpoena
before
a
grand
jury,
subject
only
to
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
after
he
got
there
and
to
the
control
of
the
court
as
to
specific
questions
that
might
be
put
to
him,
such
control
being
exercised
after
he
appeared
and
it
was
known
what
those
questions
were
and
the
reasons
why
he
felt
that
he
should
not
be
required
to
answer
them.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
in
separation
of
powers,
i
suppose,
by
historical
derivations
from
the
king,
it's
simply
a
matter
of
common
constitutional
law.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think,
if
i
go
back,
if
my
mind
goes
back
as
far
as,
livingston
and
jefferson
and
the
president
was
held
not
amenable
to
suit
and
i
understand
that
he
is
commonly
regarded
as
not
amenable
to
process
of
the
courts.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
in
the
trial
of
aaron
burr,
he
said
he
did
not
have
to
appear
and
i
repeat
i
believe
that's
what
livingston
and
jefferson
decided.
it's
just
one
of
those
historical
(inaudible)
anomalous
rules
which
one
learns
in
school
and
which
i
had
supposed
with
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
which
i
had
supposed
was
unquestioned
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
there
was
a
case
following
the
civil
war,
if
i
recall
too,
it
was
somebody
against
johnson.
south
carolina
against
johnson
could
it
be
in
which
it
was
held
when
president
johnson
was
not
amenable
to
suit.
though
the
question
actually
involved
in
this
case
is
a
relatively
narrow
one,
there
is
a
constant
effort
to
treat
the
case
on
a
broader
basis
in
the
numerous
briefs
which
have
been
filed.
but
this
court
has
called
upon
here
to
decide
only,
whether
a
reporter
can
refuse
to
appear
and
testify
before
a
grand
jury
about
matters
concededly
non-confidential
in
nature
on
the
ground
that
his
appearance
alone
would
jeopardize
confidential
relationships
and
thereby
have
a
chilling
effect
on
the
freedom
of
the
press
guaranteed
by
the
first
amendment,
the
first
amendment.
it's
clear
there's
no
privilege
to
newspaperman
at
common
law.
a
number
of
states
have
adopted
statutes
granting
a
privilege
to
newspaper
reporters,
but
there
has
never
been
a
federal
statute
to
this
effect
and
bills
which
were
granted
have
never
come
out
of
the
committee.
thus
the
respondent's
position
must
rest
exclusively
on
constitutional
grounds,
namely,
that
the
first
amendment
protects
not
only
the
right
to
print
and
publish
without
abridgment,
but
also
provides
a
constitutionally
protected
right
to
have
a
wholly
unconstrained
road
in
gathering
the
news.
there
is
no
foundation
for
this
in
the
language
of
the
first
amendment,
surely
in
it's
historical
background
or
in
prior
decisions
of
this
court.
nevertheless,
whatever
this
court
may
do
about
the
reporter's
privilege
generally,
it
should
not
justify
his
refusal
even
to
appear
before
a
grand
jury,
to
testify
only
to
matters
concededly
non-confidential
in
nature.
most
of
the
material
in
this
record,
consisting
largely
of
affidavits
prepared
by
well
known
newsman
is
not
relevant
to
this
issue.
since
with
few
exceptions
they
deal
with
the
questions
of
confidential
sources
and
confidential
material,
they
were
filed
before
judge
zirpoli's
opinion.
nevertheless,
the
position
that
the
reporter
to
need
not
even
appear
to
answer
the
questions
with
respect
to
non-confidential
material
is
argued
vigorously,
one
might
even
say
extravagantly.
thus
counsel
for
the
respondent
in
his
brief
says,
“to
an
extent
never
previously
shown,
this
record
documents,
the
devastating
effect
that
the
compulsion
of
newsman's
testimony
has
upon
freedom
of
the
press.
yet
as
i
have
indicated
with
only
one
exception,
the
items
relied
on
deal
with
confidential
sources
and
confidential
material
which
are
not
involved
here
and
they
are
based
solely
on
affidavits
from
newsman
which
are
in
their
nature
self-serving,
and
never
subject
to
cross
examination.
these
affidavits
do
show
that
there
is
a
reaching
out
among
journalists
for
a
reported
source
privilege.
but
such
a
desire
among
newsman
as
heretofore
fallen
short
of
establishing
a
constitutional
right.
since
the
briefs
were
filed
in
this
case,
we
have
a
new
source
of
information
about
this.
i
am
not
sure
just
what
it's
status
is,
but
there
has
been
made
available
within
the
past
two
weeks,
a
study
report
of
the
reporters'
committee
on
freedom
of
the
press.
this
seems
to
be
an
ad
hoc
group
of
which
mr.
fred
p.
graham
of
the
new
york
times
has
listed
as
coordinator.
the
work
was
done
by
professor
vince
blasi
of
the
university
of
michigan
law
school.
it's
clearly
a
thoughtful,
through
and
reasonably
objective
report
subject
to
the
comment
that
the
information
summarized
was
obtained
only
from
reporters
and
others
connected
with
the
communications
media.
in
addition,
a
portion
of
the
report
has
just
been
published
in
an
article
in
the
michigan
law
review
for
december
1971.
this
is
the
newsman's
privilege
and
empirical
study
in
70
michigan
law
review
229.
now
perhaps
it's
just
my
academic
background
that
makes
me
regret
that
the
professor
blasi
does
not
disclose
in
his
michigan
article
that
his
study
was
in
fact
commissioned
by
the
reporter's
committee.
as
i
have
indicated
though
within
the
plan
that
he
has
adopted,
he
appears
to
have
done
a
careful
and
thoughtful
job
and
the
court
may
find
some
useful
materials
in
the
study
or
in
the
article.
one
thing
that
does
appear
i
think,
is
that
reporters
generally
are
much
less
intense
about
this
than
is
the
respondent's
brief.
professor
blasi
says
for
example,
that
the
average
newsman
in
the
population
survey
relies
on
regular
confidential
sources
in
22.2%
of
his
stories
and
on
first
time
confidential
sources,
in
12.2
2%
of
his
stories.
another
item
of
possible
interest,
it
appears
he
asked
his
respondents,
“in
the
last
18
months,
has
your
coverage
of
any
story
been
adversely
affected
by
the
possibility
that
you
might
be
of
subpoenaed.
of
the
887
newsman
who
answered
this
question,
8%
said
yes,
10.9%
said,
i
am
not
sure
and
81.1%
said
no.
and
again,
in
the
respondent's
brief
in
this
case,
a
reporter
anthony
ripley
is
referred
to
and
the
statement
is
made
that
“anthony
ripley
was
destroyed
by
being
subjected
to
a
subpoena,”
that's
on
page
75
of
the
respondent's
brief.
but
professor
blasi
says
in
his
report
these
incidents
were
personally
very
upsetting
directly,
but
they
did
not
significantly
interfere
with
his
reporting
career.
he
subsequently
was
able
to
do
a
superb
investigative
story
on
the
shootout
in
cleveland.
anthony
ripley's
case
is
thus
not
as
it
is
sometimes
cited
to
be,
referring
to
the
brief
in
this
case,
an
example
of
the
subpoena
causing
an
intolerable
interference
with
news
quote.
if
there
were
a
reported
privilege
not
even
to
appear
before
a
grand
jury,
found
by
this
court
for
the
first
time
somewhere
in
the
penumbra
of
the
first
amendment
where
it's
surely
not
within
it's
terms,
how
far
is
it
to
extend?
to
whom
is
it
to
be
made
available?
surely,
it
could
not
be
limited
to
what
might
be
called
the
established
press
like
'the
new
york
times'
nor
can
it
be
limited
to
daily
newspapers,
or
to
newspapers.
it
would
have
to
apply
to
radio
and
television
reporting.
it
would
also
have
to
apply
to
the
foreign
language
press,
the
underground
press,
the
college
press.
it
would
have
to
apply
to
magazines
and
surely
to
pamphleteers.
what
about
people
who
write
books?
and
there
are
beginning
to
be
assertions
that
there
is
an
academic
privilege,
a
privilege
by
academic
persons
not
to
testify
about
activities
in
which
they
have
been
engaged
which
bear
some
relation
to
their
fields
of
interest
and
scholarship.
if
a
privilege
is
not
even
to
appear
before
grand
jury
is
established
on
the
part
of
the
established
press,
i
find
it
difficult
to
see
where
the
limit
can
fairly
be
drawn
with
respect
to
anyone
who
publishes
in
any
form
or
speaks,
whether
in
the
classroom
or
on
the
platform
or
on
the
street
corner
or
an
union
square.
there
maybe
safeguards
which
are
appropriate
in
particular
cases.
this
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case,
but
to
hold
that
any
person
has
a
privilege
not
even
to
appear
before
a
grand
jury
without
a
single
question
being
asked,
goes
beyond
anything
that
has
yet
been
decided
and
seems
to
us
to
go
too
far.
the
grand
jury
should
not
in
this
case,
any
more
than
in
other
cases,
be
required
to
predetermine
and
disclose
the
scope
of
it's
investigation
as
a
condition
to
calling
the
reporter
who
has
undertaken
to
make
public
any
statements
including
allegedly
direct
quotations
from
a
number
of
people.
the
press
plays
a
great
role
in
this
country
and
rightly
so.
it
has
almost
unlimited
freedom
to
print
what
it
pleases
without
prior
restraint.
as
this
court's
decisions
last
june
in
'the
new
york
times'
against
the
united
states
shows.
but
as
i
read
the
opinions
in
that
case,
though
a
majority
of
the
court
opposed
prior
restraint
on
the
facts
of
that
case,
there
was
also
a
majority
of
the
court
that
seemed
to
say
that
the
press
can
be
held
responsible
through
criminal
sanctions
when
they
are
applicable,
for
what
it
does
decide
to
print.
surely,
such
possible
criminal
sanctions
or
civil
liabilities
for
malicious
libel
which
as
far
as
i
know,
have
never
been
barred,
malicious
libel,
must
have
a
chilling
effect
on
the
press
to
utilize
that
overused
phrase.
what
this
means
is
that
the
press,
though
having
great
freedom
to
print,
likewise
has
many
responsibilities
of
citizenship.
just
as
the
press
is
responsible
and
can
be
held
responsible
for
its
actions,
reporters
are
citizens
and
retain
the
responsibilities
of
citizenship
at
the
very
least.
whereas
here,
protection
has
been
given
against
disclosing
confidential
sources
or
confidential
information,
there
is
no
basis
for
giving
a
privilege
not
even
to
appear
before
a
grand
jury.
since
the
court
below
in
effect
established
such
a
privilege,
which
judgment
should
be
reversed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
question
raised
relates
to
the
obligation
of
a
newspaperman
to
appear
before
a
grand
jury.
the
court
below
held
that
he
need
not
even
appear.
we
think
that
decision
was
wrong,
and
that
it
goes
far
beyond
anything
that
can
be
found
in
the
words
of
the
first
amendment,
and
beyond
anything
that
can
fairly
or
properly
be
implied
from
that
provision.
the
case
arises
in
this
setting.
in
november
1969,
david
hilliard,
the
chief
of
staff
of
the
black
panther
party,
stated
publicly
in
a
speech,
“we
will
kill
richard
nixon.”
this
speech
was
televised
live,
and
rebroadcast
over
many
stations.
as
a
result
hilliard
was
indicted
in
december
1969,
charged
with
making
threats
against
the
life
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
contrary
to
section
871
of
title
18
of
the
united
states
code.
the
threat
was
repeated
in
three
subsequent
issues
of
the
weekly
periodical
called
'the
black
panther.
'
numerous
public
statements
of
a
similar
nature
were
reported
as
being
made
during
the
same
period
by
members
or
friends
of
the
black
panther
party
in
various
parts
of
the
country.
the
respondent
in
this
case,
mr.
caldwell,
is
a
newspaper
man,
employed
by
the
new
york
times.
he
wrote
a
series
of
articles
about
the
black
panther
party,
three
of
which
appear
in
the
printed
record.
one
of
these
was
published
in
the
new
york
times
on
december
14,
1969.
it
appears
in
full
at
pages
11
to
16,
of
the
appendix.
in
this
article,
the
respondent
reported
on
a
conversation
he
had
with
hilliard
and
others
at
the
panther's
headquarters
in
berkeley
california.
he
quoted
hilliard
as
making
the
following
statement,
and
this
appears
on
page
13
of
the
record.
“we
are
special,”
mr.
hilliard
said
recently,
“we
advocate
the
very
direct
overthrow
of
the
government
by
way
of
force
and
violence,
by
picking
up
guns
and
moving
against
it
because
we
recognize
it
as
being
oppressive
and
in
recognizing
that
we
know
that
the
only
solution
to
it
is
armed
struggle.”
and
then
mr.
caldwell
went
to
say
in
the
article,
"in
their
role
as
the
vanguard
in
a
revolutionary
struggle,
the
panthers
have
picked
up
guns.”
some
weeks
after
the
publication
of
this
article,
the
first
subpoena
was
issued
to
mr.
caldwell,
on
january
30,
1970.
this
was
a
subpoena
duces
tecum.
it
appears
on
page
20
of
the
appendix,
but
it
was
not
pressed
and
it
is
now
involved
in
this
case.
the
second
subpoena
was
issued
on
march
15,
1970,
it
appears
on
page
21
of
the
appendix.
it
is
a
subpoena
to
testify
only.
most
of
the
proceedings
in
the
district
court
were
taken
with
respect
to
it,
but
the
grand
jury
to
which
that
subpoena
was
returnable,
expired
early
in
may,
1970.
a
new
grand
jury
was
in
empaneled
and
a
new
subpoena,
the
third
subpoena
was
served
on
may
22,
1970.
it's
that
subpoena
which
is
involved
here.
the
decision
of
the
district
court
related
to
it,
but
by
order
of
the
district
court,
the
proceedings
relating
to
the
earlier
subpoena
were
incorporated
into
these
proceedings,
and
therefore,
we
refer
to
one
or
the
other
interchangeably.
a
motion
was
filed
to
quash
the
may
22,
subpoena,
it
appears
on
pages
98,
99
of
the
appendix.
it
states,
the
grounds
of
this
motion
are
identical
to
the
grounds
of
(inaudible)
motion
to
quash
grand
jury
subpoenas
filed
march
17,
1970,
and
it
was
with
respect
to
the
earlier
motion
to
quash
that
mr.
amsterdam
stated,
and
this
is
on
page
36
of
the
appendix,
right
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
the
essential
claim
of
the
motion
to
quash
is
that
mr.
caldwell's
very
appearance
before
the
grand
jury
under
the
broad
terms
of
these
subpoenas
will
irreparably
breached
and
damage
associations
and
means
of
freedom
of
speech
and
of
the
press,
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
the
district
court,
judge
zirpoli
in
the
northern
district
of
california,
denied
the
motion
to
quash
and
directed
the
respondent
to
appear,
but
subject
to
very
specific
conditions.
the
district
court's
order
of
april
7
which
was
where
he
made
the
determination,
appears
at
pages
94–97
of
the
appendix,
and
the
corresponding
order
of
june
4
appears
at
pages
104
and
105
of
the
appendix.
the
relevant
portion
of
the
order
actually
involved
is
on
page
105
and
it
reads
as
follows.
it
is
hereby
ordered
that
earl
caldwell
is
directed
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury
pursuant
to
the
subpoena
of
may
22,
1970
and
in
so
doing,
he
shall
not
be
required
to
reveal
confidential
associations,
sources,
or
information
received,
developed,
or
maintained
by
him
as
a
professional
journalist
in
the
course
of
his
efforts
to
gather
news
for
dissemination
to
the
public
through
the
press
or
other
news
media.
two,
that
specifically
without
limiting
paragraph
one,
mr.
caldwell
shall
not
be
required
to
answer
questions,
concerning
statements
made
to
him,
or
information
given
to
him
by
members
of
the
black
panther
party,
unless
such
statements
or
information
were
given
to
him
for
public
information,
for
publication
or
public
disclosure.
and
third,
that
to
assure
the
effectuation
of
this
order
mr.
caldwell
shall
be
permitted
to
consult
with
his
counsel
at
anytime
he
wishes
during
the
course
of
his
appearance
before
the
grand
jury.
thus,
the
issue
here
is
an
exceedingly
narrower.
the
respondent
has
been
granted
protection
against
revealing
confidential
sources
and
confidential
statements.
the
government
did
not
appeal
from
that
part
of
judge
zirpoli's
order
and
this
was
partly
because
we
did
not
think
that
it
was
appealable.
it
is
clear,
however,
that
these
limitations
are
in
no
way
at
issue
here.
the
only
issue
here
is
that
expressed
in
mr.
amsterdam's
words,
in
the
show
cause
hearing
before
judge
zirpoli,
when
he
said
and
this
appears
on
page
108
of
the
appendix
in
the
transcript
of
the
hearing
before
judge
zirpoli
just
below
the
middle
of
the
page.
the
only
cause
which
we
have
to
show
is
that
mr.
caldwell
has
a
constitutional
right
not
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury.
”
the
court
of
appeals
below
sustained
this
contention
in
it's
entirety
and
held
that
the
respondent
need
not
even
appear
before
the
grand
jury
and
despite
the
broad
protection
which
has
been
afforded
to
him
by
the
district
court's
order.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
that,
that
is
perhaps
an
appropriate
interpretation
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
it
is
exemplified
at
page
125
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
now
appellant
asserted
in
affidavit
that
there
is
nothing
to
which
he
could
testify
beyond
that
which
he
has
already
made
public
and
for
which
therefore,
his
appearance
is
unnecessary
and
i
question
whether
his
appearance
is
unnecessary
just
because
it
appears
in
an
article,
there
is
some
difference
between
testimony
under
oath
and
a
newspaper
article
that
is
not
protected
by
the
district
court's
order.
this
is
a
rather
definitive
and
positive
statement,
but
i
think
its
basis
in
the
record
is
(inaudible)
and
unattenuated.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
but
this
particular
statement
can
rest
only
on
the
affidavit
of
earl
caldwell
which
appears
at
pages
17-19
of
the
appendix.
this
is
an
affidavit
intended
to
be
self-serving
and
without
any
executors
and
of
course
without
cross
examination
and
the
only
passage
in
the
affidavit
which
bears
any
relation
to
this
is
on
page
18
of
the
appendix
about
two
inches
above
the
bottom
of
the
page
where
mr.
caldwell
said,
“generally”
and
generally
certainly
leaves
quite
a
lot
of
room
for
discussion.
“generally,
those
matters
which
were
made
on
a
confidential
or
on
a
non-confidential
or
for
publication
basis
have
been
published
in
articles
i
have
written
in
'the
new
york
times.'
conversely
any
matters
which
i
have
not
thus
far
disclosed
in
published
articles
would
have
been
given
to
me
based
on
the
understanding
that
they
were
confidential
and
would
not
be
published.
”well,
in
the
first
place
what
that
word
generally
covers,
what
the
exceptions
maybe
because
obviously
when
you
say
generally,
you
recognize
that
there
are
exceptions,
does
not
in
any
way
appear
and
it
is
surely
a
legitimate
subject
of
inquiry
but
there
other
aspects
of
the
matter.
mr.
hilliard
has
quoted
in
the
article
written
by
the
respondent.
that
certainly
is
no
longer
confidential.
what
were
the
circumstances
in
which
it
was
said?
was
it
after
an
evening
of
drinks
when
people
were
talking
pretty
freely
and
loosely?
was
it
puffing
or
boosting
as
a
means
of
attracting
attention?
could
it
had
been
said
in
jest?
the
government
and
the
grand
jury
are
as
much
interested
in
establishing
the
innocence
of
mr.
hillard
as
in
getting
a
further
indictment
against
him.
this
has
not
begun
to
cover
the
field
of
questions
which
an
experienced
examiner
could
direct
his
respondent
within
the
limitations
imposed
by
the
district
court.
but
it
isn't
sufficient
it
seems
to
me
to
show
that
this
key
statement
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
has
no
adequate
foundation
in
the
record.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
know
what
it
is
meant
by
the
government
apparently
has
not
believed
it
necessary
to
dispute
it
as
disputed
it
in
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
consistently
all
the
way
along.
it
disputed
it
and
counter
affidavits
before
judge
zirpoli,
it
disputed
it
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
it
is
trying
to
dispute
it
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
if
the
court
of
appeals
believed
that,
it
was
against
every
effort
made
to
disabuse
with
such
a
belief.
the
government
has
accepted
the
restriction
as
i
believe
it
had
to,
i
don't
think
it
had
any
choice.
conceivably
we
could
have
sought
mandamus
to
compel
the
judge
to
remove
this
restriction.
that
would
have
involved
long
delays
which
at
that
time
we
were
anxious
to
avoid
and
we
did
not
foresee
the
long
delay
which
had
occurred.
we
thought
that
the
court
of
appeals
would
decide
the
case
the
other
way
and
we
could
get
on
with
the
inquiry.
we
felt
that
the
order,
that
the
limitation
was
not
appealable
and
that
in
our
judgment
discretion
it
was
not
wise
to
seek
a
review
of
it
by
a
mandamus,
but
it
by
no
means
follows
that
we
accepted
it,
thought
it
was
correct,
thought
that
it
was
warranted
or
indeed
that
it
completely
foreclosed
any
possible
inquiry
of
mr.
caldwell
before
the
grand
jury.
i
believe
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
he
need
not
even
appear
is
unprecedented.
i
know
of
no
other
decision
that
is
held
with
a
newsman
or
any
other
person
need
not
appear
before
a
grand
jury.
i
suppose
that
everyone
in
the
country
except,
the
president
of
the
united
states,
was
amenable
to
subpoena
before
a
grand
jury,
subject
only
to
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
after
he
got
there
and
to
the
control
of
the
court
as
to
specific
questions
that
might
be
put
to
him,
such
control
being
exercised
after
he
appeared
and
it
was
known
what
those
questions
were
and
the
reasons
why
he
felt
that
he
should
not
be
required
to
answer
them.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
in
separation
of
powers,
i
suppose,
by
historical
derivations
from
the
king,
it's
simply
a
matter
of
common
constitutional
law.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think,
if
i
go
back,
if
my
mind
goes
back
as
far
as,
livingston
and
jefferson
and
the
president
was
held
not
amenable
to
suit
and
i
understand
that
he
is
commonly
regarded
as
not
amenable
to
process
of
the
courts.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
in
the
trial
of
aaron
burr,
he
said
he
did
not
have
to
appear
and
i
repeat
i
believe
that's
what
livingston
and
jefferson
decided.
it's
just
one
of
those
historical
(inaudible)
anomalous
rules
which
one
learns
in
school
and
which
i
had
supposed
with
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
which
i
had
supposed
was
unquestioned
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
there
was
a
case
following
the
civil
war,
if
i
recall
too,
it
was
somebody
against
johnson.
south
carolina
against
johnson
could
it
be
in
which
it
was
held
when
president
johnson
was
not
amenable
to
suit.
though
the
question
actually
involved
in
this
case
is
a
relatively
narrow
one,
there
is
a
constant
effort
to
treat
the
case
on
a
broader
basis
in
the
numerous
briefs
which
have
been
filed.
but
this
court
has
called
upon
here
to
decide
only,
whether
a
reporter
can
refuse
to
appear
and
testify
before
a
grand
jury
about
matters
concededly
non-confidential
in
nature
on
the
ground
that
his
appearance
alone
would
jeopardize
confidential
relationships
and
thereby
have
a
chilling
effect
on
the
freedom
of
the
press
guaranteed
by
the
first
amendment,
the
first
amendment.
it's
clear
there's
no
privilege
to
newspaperman
at
common
law.
a
number
of
states
have
adopted
statutes
granting
a
privilege
to
newspaper
reporters,
but
there
has
never
been
a
federal
statute
to
this
effect
and
bills
which
were
granted
have
never
come
out
of
the
committee.
thus
the
respondent's
position
must
rest
exclusively
on
constitutional
grounds,
namely,
that
the
first
amendment
protects
not
only
the
right
to
print
and
publish
without
abridgment,
but
also
provides
a
constitutionally
protected
right
to
have
a
wholly
unconstrained
road
in
gathering
the
news.
there
is
no
foundation
for
this
in
the
language
of
the
first
amendment,
surely
in
it's
historical
background
or
in
prior
decisions
of
this
court.
nevertheless,
whatever
this
court
may
do
about
the
reporter's
privilege
generally,
it
should
not
justify
his
refusal
even
to
appear
before
a
grand
jury,
to
testify
only
to
matters
concededly
non-confidential
in
nature.
most
of
the
material
in
this
record,
consisting
largely
of
affidavits
prepared
by
well
known
newsman
is
not
relevant
to
this
issue.
since
with
few
exceptions
they
deal
with
the
questions
of
confidential
sources
and
confidential
material,
they
were
filed
before
judge
zirpoli's
opinion.
nevertheless,
the
position
that
the
reporter
to
need
not
even
appear
to
answer
the
questions
with
respect
to
non-confidential
material
is
argued
vigorously,
one
might
even
say
extravagantly.
thus
counsel
for
the
respondent
in
his
brief
says,
“to
an
extent
never
previously
shown,
this
record
documents,
the
devastating
effect
that
the
compulsion
of
newsman's
testimony
has
upon
freedom
of
the
press.
yet
as
i
have
indicated
with
only
one
exception,
the
items
relied
on
deal
with
confidential
sources
and
confidential
material
which
are
not
involved
here
and
they
are
based
solely
on
affidavits
from
newsman
which
are
in
their
nature
self-serving,
and
never
subject
to
cross
examination.
these
affidavits
do
show
that
there
is
a
reaching
out
among
journalists
for
a
reported
source
privilege.
but
such
a
desire
among
newsman
as
heretofore
fallen
short
of
establishing
a
constitutional
right.
since
the
briefs
were
filed
in
this
case,
we
have
a
new
source
of
information
about
this.
i
am
not
sure
just
what
it's
status
is,
but
there
has
been
made
available
within
the
past
two
weeks,
a
study
report
of
the
reporters'
committee
on
freedom
of
the
press.
this
seems
to
be
an
ad
hoc
group
of
which
mr.
fred
p.
graham
of
the
new
york
times
has
listed
as
coordinator.
the
work
was
done
by
professor
vince
blasi
of
the
university
of
michigan
law
school.
it's
clearly
a
thoughtful,
through
and
reasonably
objective
report
subject
to
the
comment
that
the
information
summarized
was
obtained
only
from
reporters
and
others
connected
with
the
communications
media.
in
addition,
a
portion
of
the
report
has
just
been
published
in
an
article
in
the
michigan
law
review
for
december
1971.
this
is
the
newsman's
privilege
and
empirical
study
in
70
michigan
law
review
229.
now
perhaps
it's
just
my
academic
background
that
makes
me
regret
that
the
professor
blasi
does
not
disclose
in
his
michigan
article
that
his
study
was
in
fact
commissioned
by
the
reporter's
committee.
as
i
have
indicated
though
within
the
plan
that
he
has
adopted,
he
appears
to
have
done
a
careful
and
thoughtful
job
and
the
court
may
find
some
useful
materials
in
the
study
or
in
the
article.
one
thing
that
does
appear
i
think,
is
that
reporters
generally
are
much
less
intense
about
this
than
is
the
respondent's
brief.
professor
blasi
says
for
example,
that
the
average
newsman
in
the
population
survey
relies
on
regular
confidential
sources
in
22.2%
of
his
stories
and
on
first
time
confidential
sources,
in
12.2
2%
of
his
stories.
another
item
of
possible
interest,
it
appears
he
asked
his
respondents,
“in
the
last
18
months,
has
your
coverage
of
any
story
been
adversely
affected
by
the
possibility
that
you
might
be
of
subpoenaed.
of
the
887
newsman
who
answered
this
question,
8%
said
yes,
10.9%
said,
i
am
not
sure
and
81.1%
said
no.
and
again,
in
the
respondent's
brief
in
this
case,
a
reporter
anthony
ripley
is
referred
to
and
the
statement
is
made
that
“anthony
ripley
was
destroyed
by
being
subjected
to
a
subpoena,”
that's
on
page
75
of
the
respondent's
brief.
but
professor
blasi
says
in
his
report
these
incidents
were
personally
very
upsetting
directly,
but
they
did
not
significantly
interfere
with
his
reporting
career.
he
subsequently
was
able
to
do
a
superb
investigative
story
on
the
shootout
in
cleveland.
anthony
ripley's
case
is
thus
not
as
it
is
sometimes
cited
to
be,
referring
to
the
brief
in
this
case,
an
example
of
the
subpoena
causing
an
intolerable
interference
with
news
quote.
if
there
were
a
reported
privilege
not
even
to
appear
before
a
grand
jury,
found
by
this
court
for
the
first
time
somewhere
in
the
penumbra
of
the
first
amendment
where
it's
surely
not
within
it's
terms,
how
far
is
it
to
extend?
to
whom
is
it
to
be
made
available?
surely,
it
could
not
be
limited
to
what
might
be
called
the
established
press
like
'the
new
york
times'
nor
can
it
be
limited
to
daily
newspapers,
or
to
newspapers.
it
would
have
to
apply
to
radio
and
television
reporting.
it
would
also
have
to
apply
to
the
foreign
language
press,
the
underground
press,
the
college
press.
it
would
have
to
apply
to
magazines
and
surely
to
pamphleteers.
what
about
people
who
write
books?
and
there
are
beginning
to
be
assertions
that
there
is
an
academic
privilege,
a
privilege
by
academic
persons
not
to
testify
about
activities
in
which
they
have
been
engaged
which
bear
some
relation
to
their
fields
of
interest
and
scholarship.
if
a
privilege
is
not
even
to
appear
before
grand
jury
is
established
on
the
part
of
the
established
press,
i
find
it
difficult
to
see
where
the
limit
can
fairly
be
drawn
with
respect
to
anyone
who
publishes
in
any
form
or
speaks,
whether
in
the
classroom
or
on
the
platform
or
on
the
street
corner
or
an
union
square.
there
maybe
safeguards
which
are
appropriate
in
particular
cases.
this
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case,
but
to
hold
that
any
person
has
a
privilege
not
even
to
appear
before
a
grand
jury
without
a
single
question
being
asked,
goes
beyond
anything
that
has
yet
been
decided
and
seems
to
us
to
go
too
far.
the
grand
jury
should
not
in
this
case,
any
more
than
in
other
cases,
be
required
to
predetermine
and
disclose
the
scope
of
it's
investigation
as
a
condition
to
calling
the
reporter
who
has
undertaken
to
make
public
any
statements
including
allegedly
direct
quotations
from
a
number
of
people.
the
press
plays
a
great
role
in
this
country
and
rightly
so.
it
has
almost
unlimited
freedom
to
print
what
it
pleases
without
prior
restraint.
as
this
court's
decisions
last
june
in
'the
new
york
times'
against
the
united
states
shows.
but
as
i
read
the
opinions
in
that
case,
though
a
majority
of
the
court
opposed
prior
restraint
on
the
facts
of
that
case,
there
was
also
a
majority
of
the
court
that
seemed
to
say
that
the
press
can
be
held
responsible
through
criminal
sanctions
when
they
are
applicable,
for
what
it
does
decide
to
print.
surely,
such
possible
criminal
sanctions
or
civil
liabilities
for
malicious
libel
which
as
far
as
i
know,
have
never
been
barred,
malicious
libel,
must
have
a
chilling
effect
on
the
press
to
utilize
that
overused
phrase.
what
this
means
is
that
the
press,
though
having
great
freedom
to
print,
likewise
has
many
responsibilities
of
citizenship.
just
as
the
press
is
responsible
and
can
be
held
responsible
for
its
actions,
reporters
are
citizens
and
retain
the
responsibilities
of
citizenship
at
the
very
least.
whereas
here,
protection
has
been
given
against
disclosing
confidential
sources
or
confidential
information,
there
is
no
basis
for
giving
a
privilege
not
even
to
appear
before
a
grand
jury.
since
the
court
below
in
effect
established
such
a
privilege,
which
judgment
should
be
reversed.
