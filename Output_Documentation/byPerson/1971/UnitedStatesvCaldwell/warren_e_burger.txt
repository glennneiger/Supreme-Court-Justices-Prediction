out

what

he
is
at

thought
by

witness

they
are
not
sure
and
they
serve
a
subpoena
on
him
in

usual
course

go

never

didn’t

never
be

staying
away.

before
you
get
to
that,
let
me
ask
you
this
because
it
may
relate
to
it?
suppose
the
articles
that
were
actually
published
showed
concrete
evidence
of
indictable
offenses,
do
you
think
that
the
grand
jury
could
just
put
those
articles
in
the
record
of
the
grand
jury
and
then
indict
on
that
basis
or
do
you
think
that
they
ought
to
have
the
duty
to
call
him
and
make
the
same
statements
under
oath?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
possible
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
factual
basis
on
which
to
reach
that
conclusion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i
suppose,
you
would
be
saying
that
it
would

us

make

conclusion

this
record?
