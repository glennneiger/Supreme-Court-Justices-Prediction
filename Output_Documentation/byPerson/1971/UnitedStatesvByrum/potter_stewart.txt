the

over

and
how

yes,
that
is
what
you
now
suggesting
but
the
track
of
the
majority
was
still
in
his
hands
at
time
of
his
death,
doesn’t
make
your
case
any
stronger,
really?
justice
potter
stewart
alright,
but
a
lot
of
percentage
was
still
in
his
hands?
justice
potter
stewart
if
there
has
been
a
complete
transfer
of
all
of
these
stocks
even
if
the
trust
in

your

submission
would
still
be
basically
the
