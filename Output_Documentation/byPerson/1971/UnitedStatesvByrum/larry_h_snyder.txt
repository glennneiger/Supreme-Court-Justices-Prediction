mr.
larry
h.
snyder
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
relatively
simple
and
to
my
knowledge
they’re
not
in
dispute.
however,
i
think
there
is
some
danger
that
some
of
more
important
facts
may
be
obscured
by
the
rather
extensive
citations
or
previous
cases
and
some
of
the
arguments
here.
so,
if
the
risk
of
repeating
some
of
the
facts
that
i
before
you,
i
would
like
to
outline
briefly
some
of
the
more
important
elements
of
the
byrum
trust.
counsel
has
told
you
that
it’s
in
irrevocable
trust
for
the
children
of
the
decedent
and
that
a
national
banking
corporation
is
trustee.
the
trustee
instrument
provides
that
until
the
youngest
of
these
minor
children
reaches
21,
no
distributions
from
either
corpus.
to
put
it
this
way
that
the
distributions
from
either
corpus
or
income
are
entirely
within
the
discretion
of
a
trustee
having
do
regard
for
the
education
and
the
maintenance
and
the
care
for
the
children
upon
the
youngest
child’s
reaching
21.
the
terms
of
the
trust
provide
that
the
trust
corpus
is
to
be
divided
into
separate
trust
funds
for
each
of
the
living
or
deceased
children
of
the
decedent,
and
that
each
such
fund
is
to
continue
until
that
beneficiary
reaches
the
age
of
35.
if
prior
to
reaching
age
35,
a
beneficiary
has
an
emergency
such
as
an
extended
illness
or
some
other
need.
the
trustee
is
authorized
to
pay
two
on
behalf
of
that
beneficiary
from
either
corpus
or
income.
otherwise,
the
income
is
to
be
accumulated
and
to
be
distributed
at
the
termination
of
a
trust.
decedent
didn’t
retain
the
right
to
vote
the
stock,
the
unlisted
stock
held
in
the
trust
corpus.
and
it’s
true
that
there
was
of
the
time
the
decedent’s
death
unless
it
stocked
in
three
corporations
and
at
the
right
to
vote
this
stock
together
with
the
right
to
vote
stock
owned
by
the
decedent
gave
him
the
majority
voting
interest
in
these
three
corporations.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
no,
sir
but
i
know
who
did.
it’s
the
court’s
interest
did.
my
law
partner
did
before
i
joined.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
before
i
was
associated
with
them,
my
law
partner
did.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
yes,
i
believe
some
officer
of
all
three
corporations.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
yes.
the
government
has
made
the
principle
issue
in
this
case.
the
question
of
whether
these
right
to
vote
stock.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
no.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
i
have
to
guess
it
that
i
don’t
know,
i
didn’t
know
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
i
doubt
very
much
but
i
know
he
wasn’t
a
director.
i
am
in
no
position
to
know
whether
he
was
a
customer
at
bank
or
not.
as
i
started
to
say,
the
government
has
made
the
principle
issue
in
this
case.
the
question
of
whether
this
reserved
power
to
vote
this
stock
constituted
the
right
to
designate
the
persons
who
shall
possess
or
enjoy
this
property
or
the
income
from
the
property,
the
stock
within
the
meaning
of
section
2036
(a)
(2).
the
argument
is
of
course
that
the
right
to
vote
the
stock
gave
him
the
right
to
dictate
a
corporate
dividend
policies
of
these
three
corporations
and
therefore
to
regulate
the
flow
of
dividend
income
to
the
trust.
now,
assuming
for
the
moment
that
decedent
had
this
absolute
right
to
dictate
corporate
dividend
policies
that
by
no
means
follows
under
the
circumstances
of
byrum
at
least
that
he
had
the
power
to
shift
the
income
of
the
stock,
the
beneficial
enjoyment
said
by
the
cases
to
be
the
basis
for
tax
under
section
2036
(a)
(2)
is
indicated
earlier.
the
income
from
the
stock
did
not
vest
in
the
sense
that
it
was
not
payable
as
earned.
it
was
to
be
accumulated
unless
there
were
certain
emergencies
or
other
conditions
shown
at
which
time
it
was
in
the
discretion,
excuse
me,
of
the
trustee
to
pay
this
income.
if
that
condition
or
those
conditions
did
not
exist
then
the
income
was
accumulated
headed
to
the
corpus
of
the
trust
and
paid
to
the
beneficiary
under
termination
of
the
trust.
and
we
submit
that
this
indirect
and
conditional
power
to
affect
distributions
of
income
from
the
trust
does
not
constitute
a
right
to
designate
who
shall
receive
the
trust
income.
the
right
to
designate,
the
term
“right
to
designate”
we
feel
implies
some
sort
of
a
permissive
choice
between
potential
income
beneficiaries.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
i
accept
that,
yes.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
i
think
o’malley
is
distinguishable.
o’malley
was
a
direct
part.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
in
o’malley,
as
i
recall
o’malley
the
set
lower
trustee
had
the
[voice
overlap].
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
there,
there
was
the
conscious
the
permissive
choice
that
settlor
had
the
power
to
choose.
here
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
i
like
to
get,
i’d
like
not
to
accept
it
but
its
law,
i
think
i
am.
so,
we
submit
that
that
the
reason
in
this
case,
the
facts
of
byrum,
this
right
to
designate
which
predicates
tax
under
section
2036
(a)
(2)
at
least
if
the
terms
of
the
statute
or
to
have
meaning
at
all.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
no
sir,
prior
to
age
21
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
it’s
a
discretionary
distribution,
that’s
right.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
but
the
discretion
to
distribute
income
from
or
corpus,
from
the
trust
before
the
youngest
child
reaches
21,
you
will
further
read
is
with
do
regard
for
the
education
of
maintenance
and
the
care
for
the
child
of
its
shoulder.
so,
the
question
is
not
a
reason
under
the
byrum
trust
but
it
would
seem
to
me
that
under
the
--
and
i
think
this
is
the
way
to
interpret
it
that
it
is
accumulated
unless
the
trustee
determines
in
its
discretion
that
there
is
a
need
for
distribution
of
either
income
or
corpus
or
educational
needs
or
for
maintenance
or
for
care
that
child
or
the
children.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
as
far
as
i’m
concern
it
would
be
yes.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
you’re
talking
now
who
is
the
trustee,
it’s
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
mr.
byrum
has
reserved
this
power
to
determine
what
am
to
maintain
it.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
or
it
may
not
be.
i
would
say
unto
those
terms
that
it
was
taxable,
it
was
includable
in
the
estate
of
the
decedent.
some
may
not
agree
with
me
but
i
don’t
see
how
that
could
be
held
not
to
be
taxable
in
that
case.
as
distinguish
here
from
whether
income
is
definitely
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
well,
of
course
we
keep
knowing
that
i
would
think
even
in
that
case,
it
would
still
be
a
taxable
transaction.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
but
here
is
how
equivocally
departed
for
many
interests
in
this
income
in
this
stock
whatsoever.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
well,
he
does
have
a
majority
voting
interest
in
the
corporations
and
i
think
that’s
a
point,
that
should
be
considered
because
contrary
to
the
position
of
the
government
in
this
case,
i
disagree
that
this
gives
or
gave
mr.
byrum
the
right
to
dictate
dividend
policies
to
suit
his
personal
interest.
under
the
law
of
ohio
and
under
the
general
corporation
law,
he
stood
in
a
fiduciary
relationship
to
these
corporations
and
to
all
of
the
stockholders
of
the
corporations
and
significantly
that
all
three
of
these
corporations,
there
was
a
minority
stock
holder
outstanding
or
minority
stock
interest
outstanding
who
was
not
related
to
mr.
byrum,
was
not
a
member
of
his
family.
and
we
submit
that
he
could
not
regulated
the
dividend
flow
from
these
corporations
to
suit
his
personal
interest,
his
private
purpose
without
violating
his
position
of
trust
and
question
arose
as
to
what
objective
standard
is
there
to
hold
the
majority
stock
holder
and
the
directors
to
the
objective
standard
is
this,
i
think
quite
clearly
that
this
is
corporation
law
is
that
the
stockholders
are
entitled
of
the
profits
of
the
corporation
other
than
those
profits
which
are
reasonably
needed
for
the
business
and
the
question
of
what
profits
are
reasonably
needed
for
the
business
is
a
question
that’s
answered
constantly
by
the
courts.
and
it
is
of
course
the
very
question
which
is
involved
and
the
corporate
accumulated
earnings
tax
which
was
referred
to
by
justice
stewart.
so,
they’re
very
definitely
is
an
objective
standard
to
which
a
majority
stockholder
is
held.
indeed,
in
many
respects
i
think
it’s
more
objective,
more
restrictive
than
is
some
of
the
(inaudible),
some
of
the
standards
supposedly
imposed
upon
trustees.
quite
clearly,
it
is
not
a
matter
of
the
good
faith
of
the
majority
stockholder
or
a
majority
or
the
board
of
trustees.
there’s
an
objective
standard.
they
are
obligated
to
pay
out
the
profits
of
the
corporation
unless
there
is
a
reason
on
business
need
to
retain
these
profits.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
well,
i
think
the
purpose
of
mr.,
but
frankly,
i
think
the
purpose
of
mr.
byrum
and
understand
i
did
not
know
him
and
was
not
around
when
the
trust
was
created.
i
think
his
purpose
was
to
attempt
to
hold
the
corporation
together.
i
think
a
small
corporation
has
extreme
disadvantage
or
an
older
having
an
interest
in
a
small
corporation
or
larger
corporation.
you
can
give
extensive
stock
to
a
large
listed
corporation
away
without
a
danger
of
having
the
corporation
collapse
but
this
was
a
small
everyday
kind
of
a
business
and
i
think
he
was
concerned
about
the
business
judgments
that
a
bank
would
make
or
a
successor
trustee
which
would
have
to
be
a
corporation.
so
an
answer
to
your
question,
i
think
he
was
concerned
about
the
business
judgments
that
might
occur
if
the
right
to
vote
the
stock
was
given
of
the
national
bank.
and
frankly,
i
don’t
agree
with
him.
i
think
that
i
don’t
know
how
these
other
places
but
in
columbus,
ohio,
we
probably
didn’t
have
to
do
that,
i’m
sure
the
bank
would’ve
call
them
and
said
mr.
byrum
how
do
you
want
us
to
vote
the
stock,
but
that
is
in
our
case.
unfortunately,
he
did
retain
the
right
to
vote
the
stock.
but
focusing
again
on
the
statute
which
we
can’t
get
away
from
section
2036
(a)
(2),
i
don’t
really
think
in
the
circumstances
of
byrum
that
there’s
any
shifting
of
corporate
income
or
rather
of
dividend
income
by
the
payment
or
the
withholding
of
dividends.
if
dividends
are
declared,
they
are
paid
under
the
terms
of
this
trust,
unequivocally
to
the
trust.
mr.
byrum
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.
they
were
subject
to
being
withdraw
on
the
terms
of
the
trust.
he
had
no
control
of.
if
dividends
were
withheld
as
a
results
of
legitimate
business
decision,
how
can
you
say
there’s
any
shifting
of
income
if
they
were
withheld
partially
or
totally
because
of
his
private
motives
then
the
minority
stockholders
had
redressed
in
the
court
and
indeed
under
those
circumstances,
i
think
the
trustee
himself
would
be
obligated
to
take
action
because
after
all
he
is
representing
the
stockholders,
the
beneficiary
of
this
trust.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
in
addition
to
the
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
i
don’t
think
it
would
have
changed
my
case.
i
don’t
think
it
would
particularly
help
it
but
i
don’t
think
it
would
damage
it
either
which
is
not
a
it
is
rather
unequivocal
answer.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
i
don’t
see
that
the
situation
would
change.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
[laughter]
yes!
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
yes,
i
think
it
would
and
i
think
really
that
byrum
rises
and
falls
under
reinecke.
because
byrum
is
after
all
no
more
than
an
administrative,
an
administrative
power,
byrum
have
no
more
than
an
administrative
power
and
in
the
matter
of
fact
it
was
indirect
administrative
power.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
yes,
it
was.
but
the
issue
common
to
reinecke
and
common
to
byrum
is
this
overly
back
up.
the
specific
question
in
reinecke
was
whether
these
powers
to
the
set
law
of
supervising
an
investment
of
the
trust
and
both
the
stock
held
in
trust
whether
this
constituted
the
gift
of
the
corpus
of
the
trust;
a
gift
intended
to
take
effect
at
or
after
death.
now,
that
the
rule
of
reinecke
is
that
this
kind
of
administrative
power
did
not
delay
possession
or
enjoyment.
it
did
not
delay
the
vesting
of
possession
or
enjoyment.
the
question
is
here
does
the
same
kind
of
a
power
cause
a
shifting
of
possession
or
enjoyment
and
by
apparently
of
reason
if
it
does
not
constituted
delay
of
possession
or
enjoyment,
it
doesn’t
constitute
shifting
of
possession
or
enjoyment.
i
think
the
reinecke
and
all
the
cases,
the
lower
court
cases
that
have
been
decided
after
reinecke
and
followed
reinecke
stand
or
as
a
complete
bar
to
the
position
of
the
government
here.
they
have
as
you
point
out
attempted
to
this
discount
it
because
it
was
an
active
before
the
predecessor
to
section
2036
(a)
(2)
but
the
fact
to
the
matter
is
there
is
a
common
thread
in
reinecke
and
in
byrum.
and
reinecke
cannot
be
dismissed.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
no,
there
wasn’t.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
there’s
a
specific
provision
saying
that
there
shall
be
no
revision.
i
can’t
pick
it
out
of
the
record
for
you
now
but
its
part
of
a
trust
instrument
and
there
is
no
possibility
of
a
revered
in
this
case.
to
this
point
discussion
has
been
about
the
section
2036
(a)
(2)
issue,
the
government
also
raises
the
question
of
section
30
--
the
applicability
of
section
2036
(a)
(1).
i
think
the
argument
in
support
of
its
position
is
unpersuasive
on
its
face.
i
don’t
intend
at
this
oral
argument
to
try
to
add
to
the
briefs
on
this
question
unless
there
are
specific
questions.
i
would
like
the
direct
the
attention
just
briefly
to
the
government’s
reply
brief
and
it
seems
to
me
in
it’s
reply
brief,
the
government
backs
off
of
its
earlier
position,
this
is
my
opinion.
they
take
a
new
track
and
say
that
actually
byrum
is
disposed
of
by
the
president
of
three
cases
decided
by
this
court.
the
one
being
the
o’malley
case
that
we
discussed
here
and
the
other
is
commissioner
versus
estate
of
holmes
and
lober
versus
u.s.,
and
they
also
suggest
or
it
seems
to
me,
that
we
didn’t
cite
these
cases
if
we
were
trying
to
avoid
them.
and
we
didn’t
cite
them
but
we’re
not
trying
to
avoid
them
because
on
this
point
we
agree
with
the
government.
we
think
these
three
cases
do
invite
comparison
with
byrum.
we’ve
compared
o’malley
and
as
you
will
recall
in
holmes
and
in
lober.
the
set
law
reserved
the
right
to
terminate
the
trust
in
those
two
situations
before
the
specified
termination
date
and
thereby
to
cutoff
the
contingent
remainder
interest
and
as
compared
to
byrum,
we
think
clearly
here
in
lober
and
in
holmes
is
the
situation
where
the
set
law
held
a
conscious,
a
permissive
and
open
choice.
he
had
an
open
power
to
directly
affect
the
beneficiaries
of
those
two
trusts.
this
is
not
the
case
in
byrum,
the
government
has
to
look
to
some
subjective
consideration
about
stock
manipulation
or
dividend
manipulation
in
order
to
get
to
where
it
is
now
and
we
submit
that
this
ought
not
to
be
made
the
basis
of
taxation.
the
government
is
also
somewhere
in
one
of
its
briefs
indicated
that
if
byrum
is
not
reversed
that
there
will
be
a
great
deal
of
litigation
to
follow.
and
i
think
frankly
just
the
opposite
is
true,
i
think
it’s
been
demonstrative
by
the
argument
here
today
that
byrum
is
just
one
step
in
the
government’s
plan
to
expand
section
2036
and
i
supposed
then
2038
because
if
i
understood
correctly
in
the
argument
here,
i
don’t
think
even
a
trust
will
stand
in
the
way
of
the
government
search
to
tax
this
transaction.
and
i
would
simply
say
you
in
conclusion
that
if
these
are
situations,
if
byrum
represents
a
situation
that
an
equity
dictates
that
there
should
be
a
tax
and
i
don’t
think
it
is
but
assuming
that
that’s
true
that
i
submit
to
you,
it’s
for
the
congress
to
enact
the
statutes
to
tax.
it’s
not
taxable
under
the
present
laws
and
i
submit
in
all
do
respect
that
should
not
be
made
taxable
by
this
court
but
should
be
left
in
the
congress.
thank
you.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
relatively
simple
and
to
my
knowledge
they’re
not
in
dispute.
however,
i
think
there
is
some
danger
that
some
of
more
important
facts
may
be
obscured
by
the
rather
extensive
citations
or
previous
cases
and
some
of
the
arguments
here.
so,
if
the
risk
of
repeating
some
of
the
facts
that
i
before
you,
i
would
like
to
outline
briefly
some
of
the
more
important
elements
of
the
byrum
trust.
counsel
has
told
you
that
it’s
in
irrevocable
trust
for
the
children
of
the
decedent
and
that
a
national
banking
corporation
is
trustee.
the
trustee
instrument
provides
that
until
the
youngest
of
these
minor
children
reaches
21,
no
distributions
from
either
corpus.
to
put
it
this
way
that
the
distributions
from
either
corpus
or
income
are
entirely
within
the
discretion
of
a
trustee
having
do
regard
for
the
education
and
the
maintenance
and
the
care
for
the
children
upon
the
youngest
child’s
reaching
21.
the
terms
of
the
trust
provide
that
the
trust
corpus
is
to
be
divided
into
separate
trust
funds
for
each
of
the
living
or
deceased
children
of
the
decedent,
and
that
each
such
fund
is
to
continue
until
that
beneficiary
reaches
the
age
of
35.
if
prior
to
reaching
age
35,
a
beneficiary
has
an
emergency
such
as
an
extended
illness
or
some
other
need.
the
trustee
is
authorized
to
pay
two
on
behalf
of
that
beneficiary
from
either
corpus
or
income.
otherwise,
the
income
is
to
be
accumulated
and
to
be
distributed
at
the
termination
of
a
trust.
decedent
didn’t
retain
the
right
to
vote
the
stock,
the
unlisted
stock
held
in
the
trust
corpus.
and
it’s
true
that
there
was
of
the
time
the
decedent’s
death
unless
it
stocked
in
three
corporations
and
at
the
right
to
vote
this
stock
together
with
the
right
to
vote
stock
owned
by
the
decedent
gave
him
the
majority
voting
interest
in
these
three
corporations.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
no,
sir
but
i
know
who
did.
it’s
the
court’s
interest
did.
my
law
partner
did
before
i
joined.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
before
i
was
associated
with
them,
my
law
partner
did.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
yes,
i
believe
some
officer
of
all
three
corporations.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
yes.
the
government
has
made
the
principle
issue
in
this
case.
the
question
of
whether
these
right
to
vote
stock.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
no.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
i
have
to
guess
it
that
i
don’t
know,
i
didn’t
know
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
i
doubt
very
much
but
i
know
he
wasn’t
a
director.
i
am
in
no
position
to
know
whether
he
was
a
customer
at
bank
or
not.
as
i
started
to
say,
the
government
has
made
the
principle
issue
in
this
case.
the
question
of
whether
this
reserved
power
to
vote
this
stock
constituted
the
right
to
designate
the
persons
who
shall
possess
or
enjoy
this
property
or
the
income
from
the
property,
the
stock
within
the
meaning
of
section
2036
(a)
(2).
the
argument
is
of
course
that
the
right
to
vote
the
stock
gave
him
the
right
to
dictate
a
corporate
dividend
policies
of
these
three
corporations
and
therefore
to
regulate
the
flow
of
dividend
income
to
the
trust.
now,
assuming
for
the
moment
that
decedent
had
this
absolute
right
to
dictate
corporate
dividend
policies
that
by
no
means
follows
under
the
circumstances
of
byrum
at
least
that
he
had
the
power
to
shift
the
income
of
the
stock,
the
beneficial
enjoyment
said
by
the
cases
to
be
the
basis
for
tax
under
section
2036
(a)
(2)
is
indicated
earlier.
the
income
from
the
stock
did
not
vest
in
the
sense
that
it
was
not
payable
as
earned.
it
was
to
be
accumulated
unless
there
were
certain
emergencies
or
other
conditions
shown
at
which
time
it
was
in
the
discretion,
excuse
me,
of
the
trustee
to
pay
this
income.
if
that
condition
or
those
conditions
did
not
exist
then
the
income
was
accumulated
headed
to
the
corpus
of
the
trust
and
paid
to
the
beneficiary
under
termination
of
the
trust.
and
we
submit
that
this
indirect
and
conditional
power
to
affect
distributions
of
income
from
the
trust
does
not
constitute
a
right
to
designate
who
shall
receive
the
trust
income.
the
right
to
designate,
the
term
“right
to
designate”
we
feel
implies
some
sort
of
a
permissive
choice
between
potential
income
beneficiaries.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
i
accept
that,
yes.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
i
think
o’malley
is
distinguishable.
o’malley
was
a
direct
part.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
in
o’malley,
as
i
recall
o’malley
the
set
lower
trustee
had
the
[voice
overlap].
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
there,
there
was
the
conscious
the
permissive
choice
that
settlor
had
the
power
to
choose.
here
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
i
like
to
get,
i’d
like
not
to
accept
it
but
its
law,
i
think
i
am.
so,
we
submit
that
that
the
reason
in
this
case,
the
facts
of
byrum,
this
right
to
designate
which
predicates
tax
under
section
2036
(a)
(2)
at
least
if
the
terms
of
the
statute
or
to
have
meaning
at
all.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
no
sir,
prior
to
age
21
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
it’s
a
discretionary
distribution,
that’s
right.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
but
the
discretion
to
distribute
income
from
or
corpus,
from
the
trust
before
the
youngest
child
reaches
21,
you
will
further
read
is
with
do
regard
for
the
education
of
maintenance
and
the
care
for
the
child
of
its
shoulder.
so,
the
question
is
not
a
reason
under
the
byrum
trust
but
it
would
seem
to
me
that
under
the
--
and
i
think
this
is
the
way
to
interpret
it
that
it
is
accumulated
unless
the
trustee
determines
in
its
discretion
that
there
is
a
need
for
distribution
of
either
income
or
corpus
or
educational
needs
or
for
maintenance
or
for
care
that
child
or
the
children.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
as
far
as
i’m
concern
it
would
be
yes.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
you’re
talking
now
who
is
the
trustee,
it’s
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
mr.
byrum
has
reserved
this
power
to
determine
what
am
to
maintain
it.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
or
it
may
not
be.
i
would
say
unto
those
terms
that
it
was
taxable,
it
was
includable
in
the
estate
of
the
decedent.
some
may
not
agree
with
me
but
i
don’t
see
how
that
could
be
held
not
to
be
taxable
in
that
case.
as
distinguish
here
from
whether
income
is
definitely
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
well,
of
course
we
keep
knowing
that
i
would
think
even
in
that
case,
it
would
still
be
a
taxable
transaction.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
but
here
is
how
equivocally
departed
for
many
interests
in
this
income
in
this
stock
whatsoever.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
well,
he
does
have
a
majority
voting
interest
in
the
corporations
and
i
think
that’s
a
point,
that
should
be
considered
because
contrary
to
the
position
of
the
government
in
this
case,
i
disagree
that
this
gives
or
gave
mr.
byrum
the
right
to
dictate
dividend
policies
to
suit
his
personal
interest.
under
the
law
of
ohio
and
under
the
general
corporation
law,
he
stood
in
a
fiduciary
relationship
to
these
corporations
and
to
all
of
the
stockholders
of
the
corporations
and
significantly
that
all
three
of
these
corporations,
there
was
a
minority
stock
holder
outstanding
or
minority
stock
interest
outstanding
who
was
not
related
to
mr.
byrum,
was
not
a
member
of
his
family.
and
we
submit
that
he
could
not
regulated
the
dividend
flow
from
these
corporations
to
suit
his
personal
interest,
his
private
purpose
without
violating
his
position
of
trust
and
question
arose
as
to
what
objective
standard
is
there
to
hold
the
majority
stock
holder
and
the
directors
to
the
objective
standard
is
this,
i
think
quite
clearly
that
this
is
corporation
law
is
that
the
stockholders
are
entitled
of
the
profits
of
the
corporation
other
than
those
profits
which
are
reasonably
needed
for
the
business
and
the
question
of
what
profits
are
reasonably
needed
for
the
business
is
a
question
that’s
answered
constantly
by
the
courts.
and
it
is
of
course
the
very
question
which
is
involved
and
the
corporate
accumulated
earnings
tax
which
was
referred
to
by
justice
stewart.
so,
they’re
very
definitely
is
an
objective
standard
to
which
a
majority
stockholder
is
held.
indeed,
in
many
respects
i
think
it’s
more
objective,
more
restrictive
than
is
some
of
the
(inaudible),
some
of
the
standards
supposedly
imposed
upon
trustees.
quite
clearly,
it
is
not
a
matter
of
the
good
faith
of
the
majority
stockholder
or
a
majority
or
the
board
of
trustees.
there’s
an
objective
standard.
they
are
obligated
to
pay
out
the
profits
of
the
corporation
unless
there
is
a
reason
on
business
need
to
retain
these
profits.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
well,
i
think
the
purpose
of
mr.,
but
frankly,
i
think
the
purpose
of
mr.
byrum
and
understand
i
did
not
know
him
and
was
not
around
when
the
trust
was
created.
i
think
his
purpose
was
to
attempt
to
hold
the
corporation
together.
i
think
a
small
corporation
has
extreme
disadvantage
or
an
older
having
an
interest
in
a
small
corporation
or
larger
corporation.
you
can
give
extensive
stock
to
a
large
listed
corporation
away
without
a
danger
of
having
the
corporation
collapse
but
this
was
a
small
everyday
kind
of
a
business
and
i
think
he
was
concerned
about
the
business
judgments
that
a
bank
would
make
or
a
successor
trustee
which
would
have
to
be
a
corporation.
so
an
answer
to
your
question,
i
think
he
was
concerned
about
the
business
judgments
that
might
occur
if
the
right
to
vote
the
stock
was
given
of
the
national
bank.
and
frankly,
i
don’t
agree
with
him.
i
think
that
i
don’t
know
how
these
other
places
but
in
columbus,
ohio,
we
probably
didn’t
have
to
do
that,
i’m
sure
the
bank
would’ve
call
them
and
said
mr.
byrum
how
do
you
want
us
to
vote
the
stock,
but
that
is
in
our
case.
unfortunately,
he
did
retain
the
right
to
vote
the
stock.
but
focusing
again
on
the
statute
which
we
can’t
get
away
from
section
2036
(a)
(2),
i
don’t
really
think
in
the
circumstances
of
byrum
that
there’s
any
shifting
of
corporate
income
or
rather
of
dividend
income
by
the
payment
or
the
withholding
of
dividends.
if
dividends
are
declared,
they
are
paid
under
the
terms
of
this
trust,
unequivocally
to
the
trust.
mr.
byrum
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.
they
were
subject
to
being
withdraw
on
the
terms
of
the
trust.
he
had
no
control
of.
if
dividends
were
withheld
as
a
results
of
legitimate
business
decision,
how
can
you
say
there’s
any
shifting
of
income
if
they
were
withheld
partially
or
totally
because
of
his
private
motives
then
the
minority
stockholders
had
redressed
in
the
court
and
indeed
under
those
circumstances,
i
think
the
trustee
himself
would
be
obligated
to
take
action
because
after
all
he
is
representing
the
stockholders,
the
beneficiary
of
this
trust.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
in
addition
to
the
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
i
don’t
think
it
would
have
changed
my
case.
i
don’t
think
it
would
particularly
help
it
but
i
don’t
think
it
would
damage
it
either
which
is
not
a
it
is
rather
unequivocal
answer.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
i
don’t
see
that
the
situation
would
change.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
[laughter]
yes!
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
yes,
i
think
it
would
and
i
think
really
that
byrum
rises
and
falls
under
reinecke.
because
byrum
is
after
all
no
more
than
an
administrative,
an
administrative
power,
byrum
have
no
more
than
an
administrative
power
and
in
the
matter
of
fact
it
was
indirect
administrative
power.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
yes,
it
was.
but
the
issue
common
to
reinecke
and
common
to
byrum
is
this
overly
back
up.
the
specific
question
in
reinecke
was
whether
these
powers
to
the
set
law
of
supervising
an
investment
of
the
trust
and
both
the
stock
held
in
trust
whether
this
constituted
the
gift
of
the
corpus
of
the
trust;
a
gift
intended
to
take
effect
at
or
after
death.
now,
that
the
rule
of
reinecke
is
that
this
kind
of
administrative
power
did
not
delay
possession
or
enjoyment.
it
did
not
delay
the
vesting
of
possession
or
enjoyment.
the
question
is
here
does
the
same
kind
of
a
power
cause
a
shifting
of
possession
or
enjoyment
and
by
apparently
of
reason
if
it
does
not
constituted
delay
of
possession
or
enjoyment,
it
doesn’t
constitute
shifting
of
possession
or
enjoyment.
i
think
the
reinecke
and
all
the
cases,
the
lower
court
cases
that
have
been
decided
after
reinecke
and
followed
reinecke
stand
or
as
a
complete
bar
to
the
position
of
the
government
here.
they
have
as
you
point
out
attempted
to
this
discount
it
because
it
was
an
active
before
the
predecessor
to
section
2036
(a)
(2)
but
the
fact
to
the
matter
is
there
is
a
common
thread
in
reinecke
and
in
byrum.
and
reinecke
cannot
be
dismissed.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
no,
there
wasn’t.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
there’s
a
specific
provision
saying
that
there
shall
be
no
revision.
i
can’t
pick
it
out
of
the
record
for
you
now
but
its
part
of
a
trust
instrument
and
there
is
no
possibility
of
a
revered
in
this
case.
to
this
point
discussion
has
been
about
the
section
2036
(a)
(2)
issue,
the
government
also
raises
the
question
of
section
30
--
the
applicability
of
section
2036
(a)
(1).
i
think
the
argument
in
support
of
its
position
is
unpersuasive
on
its
face.
i
don’t
intend
at
this
oral
argument
to
try
to
add
to
the
briefs
on
this
question
unless
there
are
specific
questions.
i
would
like
the
direct
the
attention
just
briefly
to
the
government’s
reply
brief
and
it
seems
to
me
in
it’s
reply
brief,
the
government
backs
off
of
its
earlier
position,
this
is
my
opinion.
they
take
a
new
track
and
say
that
actually
byrum
is
disposed
of
by
the
president
of
three
cases
decided
by
this
court.
the
one
being
the
o’malley
case
that
we
discussed
here
and
the
other
is
commissioner
versus
estate
of
holmes
and
lober
versus
u.s.,
and
they
also
suggest
or
it
seems
to
me,
that
we
didn’t
cite
these
cases
if
we
were
trying
to
avoid
them.
and
we
didn’t
cite
them
but
we’re
not
trying
to
avoid
them
because
on
this
point
we
agree
with
the
government.
we
think
these
three
cases
do
invite
comparison
with
byrum.
we’ve
compared
o’malley
and
as
you
will
recall
in
holmes
and
in
lober.
the
set
law
reserved
the
right
to
terminate
the
trust
in
those
two
situations
before
the
specified
termination
date
and
thereby
to
cutoff
the
contingent
remainder
interest
and
as
compared
to
byrum,
we
think
clearly
here
in
lober
and
in
holmes
is
the
situation
where
the
set
law
held
a
conscious,
a
permissive
and
open
choice.
he
had
an
open
power
to
directly
affect
the
beneficiaries
of
those
two
trusts.
this
is
not
the
case
in
byrum,
the
government
has
to
look
to
some
subjective
consideration
about
stock
manipulation
or
dividend
manipulation
in
order
to
get
to
where
it
is
now
and
we
submit
that
this
ought
not
to
be
made
the
basis
of
taxation.
the
government
is
also
somewhere
in
one
of
its
briefs
indicated
that
if
byrum
is
not
reversed
that
there
will
be
a
great
deal
of
litigation
to
follow.
and
i
think
frankly
just
the
opposite
is
true,
i
think
it’s
been
demonstrative
by
the
argument
here
today
that
byrum
is
just
one
step
in
the
government’s
plan
to
expand
section
2036
and
i
supposed
then
2038
because
if
i
understood
correctly
in
the
argument
here,
i
don’t
think
even
a
trust
will
stand
in
the
way
of
the
government
search
to
tax
this
transaction.
and
i
would
simply
say
you
in
conclusion
that
if
these
are
situations,
if
byrum
represents
a
situation
that
an
equity
dictates
that
there
should
be
a
tax
and
i
don’t
think
it
is
but
assuming
that
that’s
true
that
i
submit
to
you,
it’s
for
the
congress
to
enact
the
statutes
to
tax.
it’s
not
taxable
under
the
present
laws
and
i
submit
in
all
do
respect
that
should
not
be
made
taxable
by
this
court
but
should
be
left
in
the
congress.
thank
you.
