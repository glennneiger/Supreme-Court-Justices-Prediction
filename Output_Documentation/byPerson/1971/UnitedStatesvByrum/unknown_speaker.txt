unknown
speaker
mr.
zinn,
is
the
term
“effective
control”
one
that
it
used
in
the
statute
or
in
the
regulation?
unknown
speaker
are
you
going
to
give
it
somewhere
along
the
line
that
definition
of
effective
control
and
why
it
is
the
controlling
principle?
unknown
speaker
but
i
took
it
in
and
your
answer
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
powell
that
you
said
that
effective
control
would
be
equally
good,
it
might
be
a
weaker
case
in
some
respect
but
i
take
it
the
rationale
of
your
argument
must
embrace
both
actual
control
and
effective
control.
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
case
with
all
your
(inaudible)
trust?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
didn’t
sit
in
that
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
they
have
was
the
--
whatever
rights
beneficial
stockholders,
i
haven’t
any
corporation,
isn’t
it
correct?
whether
the
owner
was
mr.
byrum
and
mr.
smith
or
mr.
jones
what
the
beneficiaries
of
trust
have
were
what
the
beneficial
owners
of
the
shares
and
the
corporations
have,
correct?
unknown
speaker
whatever
those
rights
are
as
what
they
had.
unknown
speaker
you
said
that
the
beneficiaries
and
the
trust
you
were
implying
that
they
got
very
little
because
unknown
speaker
mr.
byrum’s
control
[voice
overlap]?
unknown
speaker
they
got
whatever
shareholders,
whatever
right
shareholders
have
beneficial
to
shareholders.
unknown
speaker
and
this
would
be
true
whether
mr.
byrum
where
the
owner
of
the
majority
of
stock
or
whether
mr.
john
smith
was.
unknown
speaker
now,
talking
about
the
taxability
of
mr.
byrum’s
estate
but--
unknown
speaker
you
implied
the
somehow
or
another
since
he
was
the
owner
of
the
corporation
that
the
beneficiaries
of
the
trust
got
less
but
i
didn’t
follow
that
argument.
unknown
speaker
we’ll
understand
that
as
a
holding
of
the
court
because
that
wasn’t
the
issue
in
that
case
but
it
was
apparent
approval
of
what
the
court
recognized
to
be
a
rule
of
longstanding,
isn’t
that
right?
unknown
speaker
but
that
wasn’t
the
issue.
unknown
speaker
but
necessary?
unknown
speaker
because
that
was
not
the
issue,
that
had
not
been
questioned
on
the
ideal
party
in
that
court,
in
that
case.
unknown
speaker
or
can
be
federal
income
tax
consequences
can
they
not
--
unknown
speaker
and
unreasonable
accumulation
of
earnings
which
had
motivates
directors
not
do
so
if
they’re
going
to
run
that
risk?
unknown
speaker
mr.
zinn?
unknown
speaker
i’d
like
to
be
sure,
i
understand
your
position.
suppose
the
stock
placed
in
the
trust
had
no
voting
rights
at
all.
let’s
assume
we’re
nonvoting
stock,
so
with
respect
to
that
trust
no
problem,
no
issue
with
respect
to
voting
but
the
grantor
had
retained
control
of
the
corporation,
do
retention
of
voting
stock,
that
[voice

can
be
the
same?
unknown
speaker
67-54?
unknown
speaker
suppose
there’ve
been
no
limitation
on
the
sale
of
the
stock
transferred
to
the
trustee,
would
that
make
a
difference?
unknown
speaker
but
it
might
if
in
fact
the
trustee
had
not
sold?
unknown
speaker
let’s
assume,
maybe
this
is
a
case
i
want
to
put
through
you.
suppose
the
grantor
transfers
to
a
bank
and
to
himself
as
trustee,
100%
of
the
stock
of
the
corporation
and
he
would
have
to
trustee
but
the
trustees
are
under
a
duty
to
distribute
all
of
the
income
that
they
received
but
they
happen
to
be
between
the
two
of
a
100%
over
to
a
corporation
and
as
trustee
they
have
to
control
we've
been
talking
about,
does
this
make
a
difference?
unknown
speaker
you’d
be
here
even
though
the
trustees
are
under
a
fiduciary
duty
as
trustees
that
this
taxpayer
in
this
case
is
not?
unknown
speaker
but
i
think
they
have
whatever
fiduciary
duty
of
trustees
got?
unknown
speaker
but
you
produce
the
kind
of
income
before
for
beneficiaries
that
has
to
be
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
say
that
any
kind
the
owner
of
stock
wish
to
transfer
whether
he
remains
as
it,
whether
he
is
trustee
or
whether
he
is
not
trustee,
as
long
as
he’s
got
a
control,
whether
as
a
trustee
or
not?
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
a
trustee
never
sell
unproductive
stock
in
closely
held
corporation?
well,
i
don’t
know
about
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
this
case
he
had
duty
not
to
sell
except
with
the
permission
of
the
grantor,
that
was
a
[voice

operate?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
presumption
in
fact
by
the
sec
to
the
effect
that
a
10%
owner
is
presumptively
a
controlling
stockholder,
would
you
carry
your
doctrine
that
far?
unknown
speaker
mr.
snyder,
does
the
record
show
who
do
this
trust
instrument?
unknown
speaker
before
what?
unknown
speaker
what’s
that
(inaudible)
officer
of
the
corporation?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
incidentally,
let
me
follow
through,
was
mr.
byrum
a
director
of
the
trustee
bank?
unknown
speaker
was
he
a
customer
otherwise
than
a
trust
customer?
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
show?
unknown
speaker
do
you
accept
the
proposition
that
a
trustee’s
power
to
accumulate
or
not
is
the
right
to
designate
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
(inaudible)
o’malley.
what
o’malley
has
said
to
stand
for
by
the
government,
do
you
accept
that
as
a
[voice
overlap]?
unknown
speaker
you
do?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
the
court
said
that
was
the
power
to
designate
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
you
do
begin
by
accepting
that
but
then
you
distinguish
this
situation.
unknown
speaker
mr.
snyder,
i
follow
off
the
wagon
long
away
sometime.
prior
to
age
21,
there
is
no
accumulation
direction
i
take
it,
prior
to
age
21?
unknown
speaker
well,
everything
is
discretionary
distribution?
unknown
speaker
now,
if
the
youngest
reaches
21
and
there
is
a
direction
to
accumulate
except
in
terms
of
emergency.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
that
if
the
stock
if
they
given
--
but
this
test
says
i
retain
the
income
to
the
stock
for
my
lifetime
that
the
stock
would
be
includable
in
this
estate.
unknown
speaker
but
if
this
trust
instrument
said,
i
will
pay
to
you
what
part
of
the
income
from
the
stock
that
i’ve
feel
inclined
to
pay
you?
i
may
pay
a
100%
of
it
or
i
may
a
50%
of
it,
it
will
be
the
same
result
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
independent
trustee,
mr.
byrum
gives
the
stock
to
the
bank
that
as
trustee
but
says,
i
am
going
to
[voice
overlap],
how
much
of
the
income
i
keep,
it’s
up
to
me.
unknown
speaker
he
maintain
100%
all
the
time
but
--
unknown
speaker
if
he
said,
i
won’t
keep
any
of
it
for
myself
but
i
retain
the
power
to
have
some
of
it
channeled
to
somebody
else
besides
you
mr.
trustee?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
he
does
have
to
retain
the
power
to
direct
that
the
money
shall
be
used
in
a
corporation.
unknown
speaker
mr.
snyder,
what
do
you
think
was
the
purpose
of
mr.
byrum
in
retaining
these
powers?
unknown
speaker
what
if
mr.
byrum
had
been
himself
for
trustee,
would
that
have
made
your
case
stronger
or
weaker?
unknown
speaker
yes,
and
everything
else
what
if
he
had
been
a
co-trustee?
unknown
speaker
no,
you’re
probably
--
unknown
speaker
it
was
never
on
the
brief
will
be
on
that?
unknown
speaker
we
will
bring
it
a
little
closer
partially
to
the
reinecke
northern
trust
case,
wouldn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
one
last
question
on
stock.
was
there
any
of
chance
or
reverse
in
here
in
mr.
byrum,
what
if
he
survived
all
of
the
issue?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
stock
in
a
closely
held
corporation
is
transferred
in
trust
to
somebody
else
you
mean?
unknown
speaker
what
if
he
subject
of
the
most
prevailing
were
all
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
why
is
then
that?
unknown
speaker
however,
broad
at
times
to
give
the
trust
whether
he
has
support
on
legal
list
or
they
have
big
fund
that
come
and
stock,
if
still
subject
normally
there’s
just
some
specific
provision
in
the
trust
instrument,
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
if
you
think
he
can
get
the
power
of
that
100%
common
stock.
unknown
speaker
that
doesn’t
give
any
power
to
hold
the
work
with
common
stock?
unknown
speaker
briefs
under
state
laws
--
unknown
speaker
mr.
zinn,
is
the
term
“effective
control”
one
that
it
used
in
the
statute
or
in
the
regulation?
unknown
speaker
are
you
going
to
give
it
somewhere
along
the
line
that
definition
of
effective

and
why
it
is
the
