mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
estate
planners
have
long
sort
of
method
whereby
majority
owners
of
closely
held
corporate
stock
could
maintain
control
of
their
corporations
throughout
their
lifetimes
but
nevertheless
be
able
to
pass
on
their
businesses
a
debt
without
payment
of
estate
tax.
this
federal
estate
tax
case
presents
an
attempt
which
has
less
far
been
successful
to
achieve
these
two
most
desirable
goals.
here,
the
method
employed
was
a
transfer
of
a
portion
of
the
majority
owner
stock
into
a
trust
with
the
owner
retaining
a
sure
lifetime
control
of
these
corporations
by
reserving
the
right
to
vote
the
stock
he
transferred
in
trust
and
the
right
to
veto
any
sale
of
that
stock
by
the
trustee.
we
brought
this
case
hereon
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
because
of
our
concern
with
its
effect
on
the
administration
of
the
federal
estate
tax
laws.
the
specific
facts
are
these.
the
decedent,
mr.
byrum
owned
controlling
stock
interest
in
three
corporations.
late
in
1958,
he
created
an
irrevocable
trust
naming
a
bank
as
trustee
to
which
he
there
have
to
transferred
stock
in
the
three
corporations.
the
trustee
had
power
until
mr.
byrum’s
youngest
child
reached
the
age
21
to
distribute
trust
income
and
principal
to
the
beneficiaries
in
its
discretion
when
the
youngest
child
reached
age
21,
separate
trusts
would
be
establish
for
each
child
or
for
the
surviving
issue
of
any
deceased
child.
each
child’s
separate
trust
was
to
terminate
when
that
child
reached
age
35.
the
trust
instruments
specifically
provided
that
mr.
byrum
would
retain
for
his
lifetime,
the
right
to
vote
all
unlisted
stocks
such
as
the
stock
in
the
three
corporations
he
transferred
and
the
right
to
veto
sale
of
that
stock
by
the
trustee.
on
page
4
of
our
opening
brief,
there
appears
a
small
chart
showing
the
percentage
of
each
corporation’s
stock
owned
by
mr.
byrum
and
by
the
trust
at
the
time
of
mr.
byrum’s
death.
in
the
case
of
the
first
corporation
which
is
byrum
lithographing
company,
you
can
see
that
the
total
originally
owned
by
mr.
byrum
was
71%
of
the
corporation’s
stock.
he
transferred
12%
of
the
stock
in
trust
and
retained
59%
in
his
own
name.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes
sir,
he
did.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
this
case
came
on,
on
cross
motions
for
a
summary
judgment
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
the
record
doesn’t
reveal
any
such
instance.
the
situation
that
obtained
with
byrum
lithographing
then
so
far
as
the
record
discloses,
is
that
at
all
times
mr.
byrum
owned
the
seven
--
was
able
to
vote
71%
of
the
stock
of
the
corporation
and
at
all
times
until
his
death
was
in
control
of
the
corporation.
looking
at
the
second
and
third
corporations,
graphic
realty
and
bychrome,
the
situation
is
the
same.
he
originally
owned
83%
and
88%
of
the
stock
of
those
corporations
transferred
the
portion
in
trust
and
by
retaining
the
right
to
vote
that
stock
for
his
lifetime
and
the
right
to
veto
any
sale
of
the
stock
which
assured
lifetime
control
of
those
corporations
as
well
as
byrum
lithographing.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
the
trust
was
created
in
december
1958.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
right.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
correct
the
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
correct.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
so
far
as
the
united
states
is
concerned
mr.
justice
stewart
the
case
would
be
precisely
the
same.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
indeed,
that
may
have
been
the
plan
in
order
to
obtain
the
maximum
gift
tax.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
it
would
and
i
would
suggest
that
that
would
be
a
kind
of
see
it
for
estate
planners
because
by
then
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
only
true
in
the
case
of
the
first
corporation.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
we
don’t
rely
on
the
distinction
between
whether
the
stock
retained
in
his
own
name
or
was
enough
to
control
or
whether
to
combine
right
to
vote
the
transfer
stock.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
we’d
still
be
here.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
sold
the
stock?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
in
other
words
suppose
that
he
didn’t
have
control?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
in
the
case
of
the
first
corporation,
if
he
got
below
50%
ownership,
we
might
still
be
here
if
we
could
show
that
he
had
in
substance
had
control
even
with
the
smaller
interest.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
it
does
but
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
effective
control,
that’s
right
and
if
we’re
less
than
50%
it
still
might
be
effective
control.
we
have
to
look
at
the
particular
facts.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
but
in
this
case,
we
don’t
have
that
problem
on,
mr.
justice
powell
because
there’s
no
question
that
he
had
controlled.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
no,
it
is
not
mr.
justice.
i’m
to
get
to
the
statute
in
just
one
moment
if
i
may.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
no,
because
we
don’t
think
we
have
to
rely
on
effective
control
in
this
case.
he
has
actual
control,
that’s
not
disputed
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
think
the
respondent
conceives
that
mr.
byrum
was
in
control
of
this
corporation
for
his
lifetime.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that
is
right.
i
hope
to
demonstrate
of
why
this
was
in
effect
the
testamentary
transfer
because
of
the
retention
of
control
in
this
case
legal
control
perhaps
in
another
effective
control.
after
mr.
byrum’s
death
in
september
of
1964,
the
commissioner
asserted
estate
tax
deficiencies
against
his
estate
on
the
ground
that
the
stock
transferred
in
trust
was
includable
in
this
gross
estate
under
both
section
2036
(a)
(1)
and
2036
(a)
(2)
of
the
code.
the
estate
of
course
had
included
in
the
gross
estate
only
the
stock
retained
by
mr.
byrum
in
his
own
name.
the
statute
that
set
out
on
pages
2
and
3
of
our
opening
brief
and
reads
as
follows,
“the
value
of
the
gross
estate
shall
include
the
value
of
all
property
to
the
extent
of
any
interest
therein
of
which
the
decedent
has
at
anytime
made
a
transfer,
except
in
the
case
of
a
bona
fide
sale
for
an
adequate
and
full
consideration
in
money
or
money’s
worth,
by
trust
or
otherwise
under
which
he
has
retained
for
his
life
or
for
any
period
not
as
ascertainable
without
reference
to
his
death
or
for
any
period
which
does
not
in
fact
end
before
his
death.”
one,
the
possession
or
enjoyment
of,
or
the
right
to
the
income
from
the
property
or
two,
the
right,
either
alone
or
in
conjunction
with
any
person
to
designate
the
persons
who
shall
possess
or
enjoy
the
property
or
the
income
therefrom.
on
cross
motion
for
summary
judgment
in
the
district
court,
the
district
court
granted
the
estate’s
motion
and
a
divided
sixth
circuit
affirmed.
we
begin
any
discussion
of
section
2036
with
this
court’s
decisions
in
the
o’malley
case
six
years
ago
and
more
recently
in
the
grace
estate
case
in
1969.
in
1966,
in
o’malley,
mr.
justice
white
speaking
for
the
court
stated
that
the
predecessor
of
section
2036
was
“an
important
cause
of
the
legislative
policy
of
subjecting
to
tax
all
property
which
has
been
a
subject
of
an
incomplete
inter
vivos
transfer.
in
grace
estate,
mr.
justice
marshall
writing
for
the
court
explained
that
the
purpose
of
the
predecessor
of
section
2036
and
i
quote
now
from
395
you
asked
that
320
was
to
include
in
a
decedent’s
gross
estate
transfers
that
are
essentially
testamentary,
“i
transfers
which
leave
the
transferor
a
significant
interest
in
for
control
over
the
property
transferred
during
his
lifetime.”
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
that
was
the
cross
trust.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
judged
by
the
statements
of
purpose
of
section
2036,
we
think
that
these
transfers
must
be
considered
incomplete
until
the
time
of
mr.
byrum’s
death.
that
is
essentially
testamentary,
nothing
changed
with
regard
to
corporate
operations
following
the
transfers.
mr.
byrum
was
in
control
as
he
had
been
previously.
all
that
the
beneficiaries
had
after
they
transfers
were,
one,
the
right
to
receive
such
dividends
as
mr.
byrum
as
controlling
stock
holder
determine
should
be
paid;
two,
the
right
to
receive
the
proceeds
of
a
sale
of
its
stock
if
mr.
byrum
agreed
that
the
stock
should
be
sold;
and
three,
the
right
to
the
proceeds
on
liquidation
of
any
of
the
corporations
if
mr.
byrum
voted
in
favor
for
liquidation.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i’m
not
sure
i
understand
the
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
the
statute
doesn’t
tax
all
of
the
rights,
all
such
interest
mr.
justice
but
it
taxes
them
with
a
transfer
in
trust
and
the
transfer
in
effect
is
testamentary
as
it
is
here.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that
is
right.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
they
got
what
he
said
he
should.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
would
draw
a
distinction
and
i
think
between
his
share
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
right.
but
section
2036
have
taxes
such
transfers
we
believe
where
the
transferor
isn’t
control.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
right.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
he
could
have
given
them
to
the
trustee,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
he
could
have
given
them
to
a
third
person
and
then
you’re
going
to
ask
me
whether
what
the
tax
consequences
would
be.
in
the
case
of
the
first
corporation
we’d
still
be
here
because
he
retained
it
in
his
own
name
full
in
control.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
not
at
all.
we
think
fully
within
the
scope
for
this
fiduciary
duty
he
could’ve
determined
that
all
of
the
money
should
be
returned
to
the
corporation.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
very
scanty
limits
mr.
chief
justice.
we
think
the
record
in
this
case
shows
clearly
enough
how
little
did
go
on.
if
you
will
refer
to
page
25
and
26
of
the
record,
you
will
see
that
the
dividends
that
were
the
paid
on
the
transferred
stock
from
the
time
of
creation
of
the
trust
until
mr.
byrum’s
death
total
$303.50.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
we
don’t
know
that
but
we
do
know
in
the
period
immediately
after
mr.
byrum’s
death.
the
dividends
went
up
from
10
cents
a
share
on
each
of
the
stocks
to
$2.00
of
share
a
24
of
increase
and
that
the
dividends
in
the
first
year
after
his
death
were
$1,498.00
which
were
some
five
times
what
they
have
been
in
the
preceding
six
years.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
right,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
so
long
as
directors
act
in
good
faith
in
determining
dividend
policy,
there’s
virtually
no
check
on
them.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
sir
but
that
was
precisely
the
limitation
on
the
grantor
in
the
o’malley
case
and
which
this
court
held
that
the
power
to
accumulate
income
constitutes
the
right
to
designate
within
the
meaning
of
section
2036.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
would
say
that
it’s
something
i
would
agree
with
you
that
technically
it’s
not
holding
on
the
other
hand
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
on
the
other
hand
i
would
have
to
say
it’s
something
more
than
dictum
because
it
was
essential
to
what
the
court
did
hold
than
the
sense
on
the
question
whether
accumulated
income
was
transferred
that
holding
presupposes.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes
sir.
so,
i
think
it’s
something
more
than
dictum
but
perhaps
something
less
than
square
holding.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
right.
in
any
event
our
point
here
is
that
the
grantor
in
the
o’malley
case
also
had
to
act
in
good
faith
despite
of
broad
grant
of
power
that
he
retained
to
withhold
or
distribute
income
to
the
beneficiaries
if
it
could
be
shown
that
he
was
acting
out
his
private
interest
rather
than
out
of
the
beneficiary’s
interest
in
exercising
that
power.
we
think
the
court
of
equity
would’ve
stepped
in
and
could’ve
required
the
distribution
every
trustee
has
a
duty
of
good
faith
and
a
duty
of
good
motive
but
in
order
to
establish
an
objective
limitation
on
the
power
to
designate,
we
think
there
has
to
be
a
most
specific
duty
and
nothing
in
the
respondent’s
brief,
or
for
that
matter
in
amicus
brief
suggests
that
there’s
any
objective
standard
by
which
a
corporate
director’s
exercise
of
discretion
is
limited.
they
can
--
if
they
decide
to
return
all
of
the
corporation’s
profits
into
the
business.
there’s
no
way
that
the
court
can
step
in
and
do
anything
about
it
unless
you
could
show
that
the
directors
had
a
bad
motive
but
that’s
a
subjective
standard.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
in
this
particular
case?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
would
say
couple
of
things
about
that.
first
of
all,
there’s
a
$100,000.00
exemption
from
the
section
531
tax
and
secondly,
that
still
doesn’t
prevent
a
reinvestment
of
all
the
earnings.
there’s
no
way
that
section
531
tax
can
check,
can
be
a
check
on
the
powers.
if
you
reinvested
business,
it’s
only
if
you
sit
on
and
again,
we
fail
to
see
any
distinction
between
the
limitation
on
the
power
here
and
a
limitation
on
the
power
in
o’malley.
it’s
roughly
the
same
thing
and
for
that
reason,
we
think
that
the
trust
that’s
taxable
under
section
2036
(a)
(2)
because
mr.
byrum
retained
the
right
to
designate.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
we’d
be
here,
mr.
justice.
that’s
pretty
close
to
revenue
ruling
that
chief
judge
phillips
relied
upon
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
the
court
of
appeals
which
revenue
ruling
67-54.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes
and
its
reprinted
beginning
at
page
48
of
the
record
appendix.
mr.
justice,
our
concern
here
is
not
with
the
formalities
but
ever
since
this
court
decided
the
hallock
case.
it
has
consistently
held
that
the
estate
tax
laws
to
be
determined
by
the
realities
of
the
situation.
the
realities
are
put
precisely
the
same
whether
the
grantor
turn
his
none
voting
stock
in
trust
of
to
whether
he
transfers
voting
but
retains
control
of
the
corporations.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
think
that
might
make
a
difference,
mr.
justice
if
the
trustee
had
the
power
to
sell
and
if
the
stock
was
marketable
and
if
it
could
be
shown
that
there
was
no
understanding
of
the
record
whether
expressed
or
implied
between
the
grantor
and
the
trustee
then
i
think
that
the
government
would
not
raise
this
kind
of
question.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
it
might
but
i
would
point
to
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
no,
that
wouldn’t
make
any
difference.
i
think
that
helps
our
case
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
he
might
be
under
a
duty
to
sell.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
the
trustee
in
amicus
case
did
precisely
that
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
the
grantor
in
amicus
(ph)
case
was
the
trustee
and
well,
the
facts
aren’t
of
record
yet
the
deficiency
notice
just
having
issue.
that
stock
was
transferred
in
trust
in
1948
and
the
decedent
there
died
in
1967.
the
government
has
asserted
that
the
value
of
the
stock
transferred
at
a
date
of
the
decedent’s
death
was
$24.5
million.
now,
that
subject
to
question
of
course,
that’s
the
government’s
evaluation
but
i
don’t
think
it’s
subject
to
question
that
only
$300.00
of
dividends
was
paid
on
that
stock
in
the
20
years
that
it
was
held.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
we’d
be
here.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
we
question
of
whether
they
have
more
than
a
fiduciary
duty
in
those
circumstances
more
than
a
good
faith
fiduciary
duty
because
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
they
may
be
supposed
to
produce
it
mr.
justice
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
just
don’t
produce
it.
and
i
don’t
think
amicus
case
is
a
typical
when
you
have
a
situation
like
this.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
i
am
saying
that
unless
that
he
has
a
duty
to
sell
the
stock
if
a
determination
is
made
that
no
dividends
should
be
paid.
in
the
exercise
of
his
power
as
a
director,
he
may
determine
that
they
shouldn’t
have
be
any
dividends
pay.
he
may
determine
that
the
corporation
has
cash
shortage.
now,
nobody
sells
this
kind
of
stock
in
closely
held
corporations,
mr.
justice
they
hold
on
to
it.
and
so
there’s
a
conflict
in
duties
here
and
we
say
that
the
way
of
that
conflict
is
resolve
is,
yes
the
trustee
has
a
duty
of
good
faith,
yes
to
that
trustee
has
duty
of
to
a
motive
but
he
has
no
duty
in
those
circumstances
to
fairly
apportion
income.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
as
i
say
in
this
case,
one
could
make
the
same
argument
for
an
amicus
case
but
the
fact
is
they
didn’t
sell
it.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
this
is
an
easier
case
for
the
government
but
i’ll
not
be
prepared
to
concede
amicus
case.
i
think
the
facts
in
that
case
are
so
bizarre
that’s
a
stronger
case
for
the
government
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
no.
one
last
word
mr.
justice
powell
with
regard
to
the
question
of
where
the
power
to
sell
is
given
to
the
trustee,
i
would
refer
you
to
the
berkwitz
case
which
is
cited
in
the
footnote
on
page
19
of
our
brief
involving
the
situation
largely
like
the
one
that
you
raised.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
might
if
the
rest
of
the
stock
was
45-45
and
the
other
two
people
log
ahead.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
should
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do.
three
points,
first
if
this
court
affirms
the
decision
below,
i
want
to
suggest
that
in
the
absence
of
further
legislative
change,
it
would
be
a
rare
case
indeed
when
stock
in
a
closely
held
corporation
is
subject
to
the
estate
tax.
i
don’t
think
this
is
consistent.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
if
you
can
do
it
this
way
mr.
justice
and
keep
control
throughout
your
lifetime,
i
don’t
see
why
you
transfer
to
independent
trust
estate.
i
would
suggest
only
that
this
is
totally
incompatible
with
the
congressional
intent,
i
would
refer
the
court
to
section
303
of
the
code
which
provides
a
special
redemption
provisions
for
the
payment
of
debt
taxes
and
administrative
expenses
and
is
usually
applicable
in
the
case
of
stock
with
closely
held
corporations,
how
deferral
so
the
section
6166
of
the
code
which
provides
that
where
the
bulk
in
the
estate
is
made
up
of
stock
that
closely
held
corporation.
the
state
tax
maybe
paid
in
10
installments
rather
than
15
months
after
death.
i
would
like
to
return
if
i
may
to
mr.
justice
white’s
query
regarding
the
duties
of
trustees.
i
would
agree
with
him
that
where
the
trustee
has
only
those
powers
necessary
on
the
estate
law
that
is
let’s
if
he
is
confined
in
an
investment
to
the
legal
list
that
he
has
a
duty
to
apportion
fairly
between
the
income
beneficiaries
and
remainder
but
you
can
take
gradations
of
that
case
and
first
you
can
give
him
the
power
to
go
beyond
the
legal
list
and
that
gives
him
some
all
latitude
in
shifting
the
beneficial
enjoyment
of
income
and
then
i
would
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
i
think
but
these
additional
powers,
mr.
justice
are
put
in
to
the
trust
instruments
and
they
go
so
far
as
to
say
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
if
he
has
only
the
powers
that
to
invest,
talking
about
the
investment
power
to
invest
in
property
on
legal
list,
we
wouldn’t
say
that
he
has
the
right
to
designat.
but
when
he
can
go
beyond
that,
when
he
can
go
beyond
it
and
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
right.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
100%
in
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
it
may
give
power;
i
think
that
it
could
give
power
to
invest.
let’s
say
in
arbien
stocks.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
[laughter]
i
would
like
to
make
one
last
point.
we
rely
also
on
section
2036(a)
(1)
of
the
code.
we
say
that
the
decedent
here
retains
the
enjoyment
of
the
transferred
property
and
we
think
again
the
court’s
realistic
approach
that
it
has
been
applied
since
holland
should
be
applied
here.
if
one
has
bond
of
at&t,
obviously
the
essence
of
enjoyment
to
that
bond
is
the
income
from
the
bond.
if
one
has
an
oil
painting,
the
essence
of
enjoyment
of
the
oil
painting
is
having
it
hang
in
once
home.
in
the
case
of
a
close
corporation,
the
essence
of
enjoyment
is
controlling
that
corporation
setting
ones
own
salary,
setting
ones
own
fringe
benefits
within
limits
to
be
sure
that
setting
them
nonetheless
and
i
would
in
closing
in
refer
the
court
to
the
quotation
from
professor
o’neal
which
we
have
set
out
at
some
length
on
pages
24
and
25
on
our
brief.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
estate
planners
have
long
sort
of
method
whereby
majority
owners
of
closely
held
corporate
stock
could
maintain
control
of
their
corporations
throughout
their
lifetimes
but
nevertheless
be
able
to
pass
on
their
businesses
a
debt
without
payment
of
estate
tax.
this
federal
estate
tax
case
presents
an
attempt
which
has
less
far
been
successful
to
achieve
these
two
most
desirable
goals.
here,
the
method
employed
was
a
transfer
of
a
portion
of
the
majority
owner
stock
into
a
trust
with
the
owner
retaining
a
sure
lifetime
control
of
these
corporations
by
reserving
the
right
to
vote
the
stock
he
transferred
in
trust
and
the
right
to
veto
any
sale
of
that
stock
by
the
trustee.
we
brought
this
case
hereon
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
because
of
our
concern
with
its
effect
on
the
administration
of
the
federal
estate
tax
laws.
the
specific
facts
are
these.
the
decedent,
mr.
byrum
owned
controlling
stock
interest
in
three
corporations.
late
in
1958,
he
created
an
irrevocable
trust
naming
a
bank
as
trustee
to
which
he
there
have
to
transferred
stock
in
the
three
corporations.
the
trustee
had
power
until
mr.
byrum’s
youngest
child
reached
the
age
21
to
distribute
trust
income
and
principal
to
the
beneficiaries
in
its
discretion
when
the
youngest
child
reached
age
21,
separate
trusts
would
be
establish
for
each
child
or
for
the
surviving
issue
of
any
deceased
child.
each
child’s
separate
trust
was
to
terminate
when
that
child
reached
age
35.
the
trust
instruments
specifically
provided
that
mr.
byrum
would
retain
for
his
lifetime,
the
right
to
vote
all
unlisted
stocks
such
as
the
stock
in
the
three
corporations
he
transferred
and
the
right
to
veto
sale
of
that
stock
by
the
trustee.
on
page
4
of
our
opening
brief,
there
appears
a
small
chart
showing
the
percentage
of
each
corporation’s
stock
owned
by
mr.
byrum
and
by
the
trust
at
the
time
of
mr.
byrum’s
death.
in
the
case
of
the
first
corporation
which
is
byrum
lithographing
company,
you
can
see
that
the
total
originally
owned
by
mr.
byrum
was
71%
of
the
corporation’s
stock.
he
transferred
12%
of
the
stock
in
trust
and
retained
59%
in
his
own
name.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes
sir,
he
did.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
this
case
came
on,
on
cross
motions
for
a
summary
judgment
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
the
record
doesn’t
reveal
any
such
instance.
the
situation
that
obtained
with
byrum
lithographing
then
so
far
as
the
record
discloses,
is
that
at
all
times
mr.
byrum
owned
the
seven
--
was
able
to
vote
71%
of
the
stock
of
the
corporation
and
at
all
times
until
his
death
was
in
control
of
the
corporation.
looking
at
the
second
and
third
corporations,
graphic
realty
and
bychrome,
the
situation
is
the
same.
he
originally
owned
83%
and
88%
of
the
stock
of
those
corporations
transferred
the
portion
in
trust
and
by
retaining
the
right
to
vote
that
stock
for
his
lifetime
and
the
right
to
veto
any
sale
of
the
stock
which
assured
lifetime
control
of
those
corporations
as
well
as
byrum
lithographing.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
the
trust
was
created
in
december
1958.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
right.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
correct
the
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
correct.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
so
far
as
the
united
states
is
concerned
mr.
justice
stewart
the
case
would
be
precisely
the
same.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
indeed,
that
may
have
been
the
plan
in
order
to
obtain
the
maximum
gift
tax.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
it
would
and
i
would
suggest
that
that
would
be
a
kind
of
see
it
for
estate
planners
because
by
then
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
only
true
in
the
case
of
the
first
corporation.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
we
don’t
rely
on
the
distinction
between
whether
the
stock
retained
in
his
own
name
or
was
enough
to
control
or
whether
to
combine
right
to
vote
the
transfer
stock.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
we’d
still
be
here.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
sold
the
stock?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
in
other
words
suppose
that
he
didn’t
have
control?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
in
the
case
of
the
first
corporation,
if
he
got
below
50%
ownership,
we
might
still
be
here
if
we
could
show
that
he
had
in
substance
had
control
even
with
the
smaller
interest.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
it
does
but
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
effective
control,
that’s
right
and
if
we’re
less
than
50%
it
still
might
be
effective
control.
we
have
to
look
at
the
particular
facts.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
but
in
this
case,
we
don’t
have
that
problem
on,
mr.
justice
powell
because
there’s
no
question
that
he
had
controlled.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
no,
it
is
not
mr.
justice.
i’m
to
get
to
the
statute
in
just
one
moment
if
i
may.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
no,
because
we
don’t
think
we
have
to
rely
on
effective
control
in
this
case.
he
has
actual
control,
that’s
not
disputed
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
think
the
respondent
conceives
that
mr.
byrum
was
in
control
of
this
corporation
for
his
lifetime.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that
is
right.
i
hope
to
demonstrate
of
why
this
was
in
effect
the
testamentary
transfer
because
of
the
retention
of
control
in
this
case
legal
control
perhaps
in
another
effective
control.
after
mr.
byrum’s
death
in
september
of
1964,
the
commissioner
asserted
estate
tax
deficiencies
against
his
estate
on
the
ground
that
the
stock
transferred
in
trust
was
includable
in
this
gross
estate
under
both
section
2036
(a)
(1)
and
2036
(a)
(2)
of
the
code.
the
estate
of
course
had
included
in
the
gross
estate
only
the
stock
retained
by
mr.
byrum
in
his
own
name.
the
statute
that
set
out
on
pages
2
and
3
of
our
opening
brief
and
reads
as
follows,
“the
value
of
the
gross
estate
shall
include
the
value
of
all
property
to
the
extent
of
any
interest
therein
of
which
the
decedent
has
at
anytime
made
a
transfer,
except
in
the
case
of
a
bona
fide
sale
for
an
adequate
and
full
consideration
in
money
or
money’s
worth,
by
trust
or
otherwise
under
which
he
has
retained
for
his
life
or
for
any
period
not
as
ascertainable
without
reference
to
his
death
or
for
any
period
which
does
not
in
fact
end
before
his
death.”
one,
the
possession
or
enjoyment
of,
or
the
right
to
the
income
from
the
property
or
two,
the
right,
either
alone
or
in
conjunction
with
any
person
to
designate
the
persons
who
shall
possess
or
enjoy
the
property
or
the
income
therefrom.
on
cross
motion
for
summary
judgment
in
the
district
court,
the
district
court
granted
the
estate’s
motion
and
a
divided
sixth
circuit
affirmed.
we
begin
any
discussion
of
section
2036
with
this
court’s
decisions
in
the
o’malley
case
six
years
ago
and
more
recently
in
the
grace
estate
case
in
1969.
in
1966,
in
o’malley,
mr.
justice
white
speaking
for
the
court
stated
that
the
predecessor
of
section
2036
was
“an
important
cause
of
the
legislative
policy
of
subjecting
to
tax
all
property
which
has
been
a
subject
of
an
incomplete
inter
vivos
transfer.
in
grace
estate,
mr.
justice
marshall
writing
for
the
court
explained
that
the
purpose
of
the
predecessor
of
section
2036
and
i
quote
now
from
395
you
asked
that
320
was
to
include
in
a
decedent’s
gross
estate
transfers
that
are
essentially
testamentary,
“i
transfers
which
leave
the
transferor
a
significant
interest
in
for
control
over
the
property
transferred
during
his
lifetime.”
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
that
was
the
cross
trust.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
judged
by
the
statements
of
purpose
of
section
2036,
we
think
that
these
transfers
must
be
considered
incomplete
until
the
time
of
mr.
byrum’s
death.
that
is
essentially
testamentary,
nothing
changed
with
regard
to
corporate
operations
following
the
transfers.
mr.
byrum
was
in
control
as
he
had
been
previously.
all
that
the
beneficiaries
had
after
they
transfers
were,
one,
the
right
to
receive
such
dividends
as
mr.
byrum
as
controlling
stock
holder
determine
should
be
paid;
two,
the
right
to
receive
the
proceeds
of
a
sale
of
its
stock
if
mr.
byrum
agreed
that
the
stock
should
be
sold;
and
three,
the
right
to
the
proceeds
on
liquidation
of
any
of
the
corporations
if
mr.
byrum
voted
in
favor
for
liquidation.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i’m
not
sure
i
understand
the
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
the
statute
doesn’t
tax
all
of
the
rights,
all
such
interest
mr.
justice
but
it
taxes
them
with
a
transfer
in
trust
and
the
transfer
in
effect
is
testamentary
as
it
is
here.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that
is
right.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
they
got
what
he
said
he
should.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
would
draw
a
distinction
and
i
think
between
his
share
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
right.
but
section
2036
have
taxes
such
transfers
we
believe
where
the
transferor
isn’t
control.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
right.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
he
could
have
given
them
to
the
trustee,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
he
could
have
given
them
to
a
third
person
and
then
you’re
going
to
ask
me
whether
what
the
tax
consequences
would
be.
in
the
case
of
the
first
corporation
we’d
still
be
here
because
he
retained
it
in
his
own
name
full
in
control.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
not
at
all.
we
think
fully
within
the
scope
for
this
fiduciary
duty
he
could’ve
determined
that
all
of
the
money
should
be
returned
to
the
corporation.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
very
scanty
limits
mr.
chief
justice.
we
think
the
record
in
this
case
shows
clearly
enough
how
little
did
go
on.
if
you
will
refer
to
page
25
and
26
of
the
record,
you
will
see
that
the
dividends
that
were
the
paid
on
the
transferred
stock
from
the
time
of
creation
of
the
trust
until
mr.
byrum’s
death
total
$303.50.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
we
don’t
know
that
but
we
do
know
in
the
period
immediately
after
mr.
byrum’s
death.
the
dividends
went
up
from
10
cents
a
share
on
each
of
the
stocks
to
$2.00
of
share
a
24
of
increase
and
that
the
dividends
in
the
first
year
after
his
death
were
$1,498.00
which
were
some
five
times
what
they
have
been
in
the
preceding
six
years.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
right,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
so
long
as
directors
act
in
good
faith
in
determining
dividend
policy,
there’s
virtually
no
check
on
them.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
sir
but
that
was
precisely
the
limitation
on
the
grantor
in
the
o’malley
case
and
which
this
court
held
that
the
power
to
accumulate
income
constitutes
the
right
to
designate
within
the
meaning
of
section
2036.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
would
say
that
it’s
something
i
would
agree
with
you
that
technically
it’s
not
holding
on
the
other
hand
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
on
the
other
hand
i
would
have
to
say
it’s
something
more
than
dictum
because
it
was
essential
to
what
the
court
did
hold
than
the
sense
on
the
question
whether
accumulated
income
was
transferred
that
holding
presupposes.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes
sir.
so,
i
think
it’s
something
more
than
dictum
but
perhaps
something
less
than
square
holding.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
right.
in
any
event
our
point
here
is
that
the
grantor
in
the
o’malley
case
also
had
to
act
in
good
faith
despite
of
broad
grant
of
power
that
he
retained
to
withhold
or
distribute
income
to
the
beneficiaries
if
it
could
be
shown
that
he
was
acting
out
his
private
interest
rather
than
out
of
the
beneficiary’s
interest
in
exercising
that
power.
we
think
the
court
of
equity
would’ve
stepped
in
and
could’ve
required
the
distribution
every
trustee
has
a
duty
of
good
faith
and
a
duty
of
good
motive
but
in
order
to
establish
an
objective
limitation
on
the
power
to
designate,
we
think
there
has
to
be
a
most
specific
duty
and
nothing
in
the
respondent’s
brief,
or
for
that
matter
in
amicus
brief
suggests
that
there’s
any
objective
standard
by
which
a
corporate
director’s
exercise
of
discretion
is
limited.
they
can
--
if
they
decide
to
return
all
of
the
corporation’s
profits
into
the
business.
there’s
no
way
that
the
court
can
step
in
and
do
anything
about
it
unless
you
could
show
that
the
directors
had
a
bad
motive
but
that’s
a
subjective
standard.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
in
this
particular
case?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
would
say
couple
of
things
about
that.
first
of
all,
there’s
a
$100,000.00
exemption
from
the
section
531
tax
and
secondly,
that
still
doesn’t
prevent
a
reinvestment
of
all
the
earnings.
there’s
no
way
that
section
531
tax
can
check,
can
be
a
check
on
the
powers.
if
you
reinvested
business,
it’s
only
if
you
sit
on
and
again,
we
fail
to
see
any
distinction
between
the
limitation
on
the
power
here
and
a
limitation
on
the
power
in
o’malley.
it’s
roughly
the
same
thing
and
for
that
reason,
we
think
that
the
trust
that’s
taxable
under
section
2036
(a)
(2)
because
mr.
byrum
retained
the
right
to
designate.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
we’d
be
here,
mr.
justice.
that’s
pretty
close
to
revenue
ruling
that
chief
judge
phillips
relied
upon
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
the
court
of
appeals
which
revenue
ruling
67-54.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes
and
its
reprinted
beginning
at
page
48
of
the
record
appendix.
mr.
justice,
our
concern
here
is
not
with
the
formalities
but
ever
since
this
court
decided
the
hallock
case.
it
has
consistently
held
that
the
estate
tax
laws
to
be
determined
by
the
realities
of
the
situation.
the
realities
are
put
precisely
the
same
whether
the
grantor
turn
his
none
voting
stock
in
trust
of
to
whether
he
transfers
voting
but
retains
control
of
the
corporations.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
think
that
might
make
a
difference,
mr.
justice
if
the
trustee
had
the
power
to
sell
and
if
the
stock
was
marketable
and
if
it
could
be
shown
that
there
was
no
understanding
of
the
record
whether
expressed
or
implied
between
the
grantor
and
the
trustee
then
i
think
that
the
government
would
not
raise
this
kind
of
question.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
it
might
but
i
would
point
to
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
no,
that
wouldn’t
make
any
difference.
i
think
that
helps
our
case
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
he
might
be
under
a
duty
to
sell.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
the
trustee
in
amicus
case
did
precisely
that
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
the
grantor
in
amicus
(ph)
case
was
the
trustee
and
well,
the
facts
aren’t
of
record
yet
the
deficiency
notice
just
having
issue.
that
stock
was
transferred
in
trust
in
1948
and
the
decedent
there
died
in
1967.
the
government
has
asserted
that
the
value
of
the
stock
transferred
at
a
date
of
the
decedent’s
death
was
$24.5
million.
now,
that
subject
to
question
of
course,
that’s
the
government’s
evaluation
but
i
don’t
think
it’s
subject
to
question
that
only
$300.00
of
dividends
was
paid
on
that
stock
in
the
20
years
that
it
was
held.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
we’d
be
here.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
we
question
of
whether
they
have
more
than
a
fiduciary
duty
in
those
circumstances
more
than
a
good
faith
fiduciary
duty
because
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
they
may
be
supposed
to
produce
it
mr.
justice
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
just
don’t
produce
it.
and
i
don’t
think
amicus
case
is
a
typical
when
you
have
a
situation
like
this.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
i
am
saying
that
unless
that
he
has
a
duty
to
sell
the
stock
if
a
determination
is
made
that
no
dividends
should
be
paid.
in
the
exercise
of
his
power
as
a
director,
he
may
determine
that
they
shouldn’t
have
be
any
dividends
pay.
he
may
determine
that
the
corporation
has
cash
shortage.
now,
nobody
sells
this
kind
of
stock
in
closely
held
corporations,
mr.
justice
they
hold
on
to
it.
and
so
there’s
a
conflict
in
duties
here
and
we
say
that
the
way
of
that
conflict
is
resolve
is,
yes
the
trustee
has
a
duty
of
good
faith,
yes
to
that
trustee
has
duty
of
to
a
motive
but
he
has
no
duty
in
those
circumstances
to
fairly
apportion
income.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
as
i
say
in
this
case,
one
could
make
the
same
argument
for
an
amicus
case
but
the
fact
is
they
didn’t
sell
it.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
this
is
an
easier
case
for
the
government
but
i’ll
not
be
prepared
to
concede
amicus
case.
i
think
the
facts
in
that
case
are
so
bizarre
that’s
a
stronger
case
for
the
government
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
no.
one
last
word
mr.
justice
powell
with
regard
to
the
question
of
where
the
power
to
sell
is
given
to
the
trustee,
i
would
refer
you
to
the
berkwitz
case
which
is
cited
in
the
footnote
on
page
19
of
our
brief
involving
the
situation
largely
like
the
one
that
you
raised.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
might
if
the
rest
of
the
stock
was
45-45
and
the
other
two
people
log
ahead.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
should
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do.
three
points,
first
if
this
court
affirms
the
decision
below,
i
want
to
suggest
that
in
the
absence
of
further
legislative
change,
it
would
be
a
rare
case
indeed
when
stock
in
a
closely
held
corporation
is
subject
to
the
estate
tax.
i
don’t
think
this
is
consistent.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
if
you
can
do
it
this
way
mr.
justice
and
keep
control
throughout
your
lifetime,
i
don’t
see
why
you
transfer
to
independent
trust
estate.
i
would
suggest
only
that
this
is
totally
incompatible
with
the
congressional
intent,
i
would
refer
the
court
to
section
303
of
the
code
which
provides
a
special
redemption
provisions
for
the
payment
of
debt
taxes
and
administrative
expenses
and
is
usually
applicable
in
the
case
of
stock
with
closely
held
corporations,
how
deferral
so
the
section
6166
of
the
code
which
provides
that
where
the
bulk
in
the
estate
is
made
up
of
stock
that
closely
held
corporation.
the
state
tax
maybe
paid
in
10
installments
rather
than
15
months
after
death.
i
would
like
to
return
if
i
may
to
mr.
justice
white’s
query
regarding
the
duties
of
trustees.
i
would
agree
with
him
that
where
the
trustee
has
only
those
powers
necessary
on
the
estate
law
that
is
let’s
if
he
is
confined
in
an
investment
to
the
legal
list
that
he
has
a
duty
to
apportion
fairly
between
the
income
beneficiaries
and
remainder
but
you
can
take
gradations
of
that
case
and
first
you
can
give
him
the
power
to
go
beyond
the
legal
list
and
that
gives
him
some
all
latitude
in
shifting
the
beneficial
enjoyment
of
income
and
then
i
would
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
i
think
but
these
additional
powers,
mr.
justice
are
put
in
to
the
trust
instruments
and
they
go
so
far
as
to
say
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
if
he
has
only
the
powers
that
to
invest,
talking
about
the
investment
power
to
invest
in
property
on
legal
list,
we
wouldn’t
say
that
he
has
the
right
to
designat.
but
when
he
can
go
beyond
that,
when
he
can
go
beyond
it
and
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
right.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
100%
in
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
it
may
give
power;
i
think
that
it
could
give
power
to
invest.
let’s
say
in
arbien
stocks.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
[laughter]
i
would
like
to
make
one
last
point.
we
rely
also
on
section
2036(a)
(1)
of
the
code.
we
say
that
the
decedent
here
retains
the
enjoyment
of
the
transferred
property
and
we
think
again
the
court’s
realistic
approach
that
it
has
been
applied
since
holland
should
be
applied
here.
if
one
has
bond
of
at&t,
obviously
the
essence
of
enjoyment
to
that
bond
is
the
income
from
the
bond.
if
one
has
an
oil
painting,
the
essence
of
enjoyment
of
the
oil
painting
is
having
it
hang
in
once
home.
in
the
case
of
a
close
corporation,
the
essence
of
enjoyment
is
controlling
that
corporation
setting
ones
own
salary,
setting
ones
own
fringe
benefits
within
limits
to
be
sure
that
setting
them
nonetheless
and
i
would
in
closing
in
refer
the
court
to
the
quotation
from
professor
o’neal
which
we
have
set
out
at
some
length
on
pages
24
and
25
on
our
brief.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
