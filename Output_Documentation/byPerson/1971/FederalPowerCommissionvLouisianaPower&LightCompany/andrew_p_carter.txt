mr.
andrew
p.
carter
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
lp&l's
affirmative
position
in
this
case
is
that
its
contracts
with
united
or
direct
sales
contract,
direct
industrial
sales
contracts
exempt
under
section
1
(b)
of
the
act.
the
fifth
circuit
has
so
held,
that's
the
decision
here
on
for
review.
now
the
fpc
in
order
to
scrape
that
holding
is
arguing
that
it
has
a
plenary
jurisdiction
under
what
it
terms
its
transportation
authority,
and
it
points
to
the
first
part
of
section
1
(b)
to
say
that
that's
where
its
transportation
authority
resides.
now,
our
brief
we
believe
adequately
talked
about
the
direct
sale
aspects
and
we
believe
the
fifth
circuit
opinion
adequately
speaks
to
that
subject
and
we're
going
to
spend
our
time
today
in
rebutting
that
the
position
that
the
fpc
takes
about
this
plenary
transportation
authority.
i
think
that
while
there
is
a
lot
of
chaff
in
this
case,
we
can
get
to
the
essence
very
quickly
by
my
saying
that
in
order
to
determine
the
jurisdiction
here,
all
we
have
to
look
at
is
three
key
factors.
and
i'm
not
going
to
say
as
mr.
plotkin
said
earlier
that
this
is
a
simple
issue.
but
i
believe
that
if
we
look
at
the
three
factors
it
will
simplify
the
case
for
the
court.
those
three
factors
are,
first
of
all,
the
congressional
history.
and
in
this
case
i
don't
believe
i
can
emphasize
too
strongly,
the
effect
of
that
congressional
history
on
this
whole
matter.
the
second
thing
is
the
decisions
of
this
court,
and
i'm
speaking
now
of
the
panhandle
indiana
case,
337
and
the
transco
case
in
365
us.
and
the
third
is
the
actions
of
the
fpc
itself.
now,
addressing
myself
to
the
congressional
history
first
and
i'll
dwell
on
it
a
little
bit
because
as
i
said
it
is
so
important
to
this
whole
matter.
we
did
a
rather
comprehensive
study
of
that
legislative
history
and
it
became
more
interesting
all
along,
because
we
found
that
the
history
here
was
taking
place
during
1936,
1937
and
1938,
which
i
believe
we
all
will
agree
were
the
high
watermarks
of
the
roosevelt
administration
in
terms
of
the
passage
of
regulatory
legislation.
and
an
example
of
that
i
would
say
is
the
national
labor
relations
act,
which
is
i
think
the
court
knows
so
well
has
an
exclusive
or
peremptory
nature
to
it.
and
i
think
all
of
that
legislation
at
that
time
was
of
the
same
type
with
the
sole
exception
of
this
natural
gas
act.
that's
an
interesting
thing
about
this
congressional
history
is
that
congress
and
apparently
it
was
getting
a
lot
of
heat,
i
would
say,
from
the
national
association
of
railroad
and
utilities
commission
as
the
representatives
of
the
state
authorities.
and
speaking
for
the
states,
they
made
a
strong
case
for
the
proposition
of
dual
regulation
here.
and
as
a
result,
you
had
--
running
like
a
thread
through
the
congressional
history,
the
proposition
that
we
would
have
dual
regulation
and
we
were
going
to
leave
to
the
states,
those
things
that
the
states
had
already
been
regulating
and
that
congress
felt
they
could
reach
and
the
courts
felt
they
could
reach.
now
section
1
(b)
reflects
that
history
because
section
1
(b)
really
is
a
two
part
sort
of
statute.
in
the
first
part
of
the
statute,
it
tells
what
matters
will
fall
into
the
ambit
of
fpc
jurisdiction,
and
then
it
has
a
'but'
clause
in
it,
a
conservatory
proviso
which
reserves
to
the
states
those
things
that
are
to
be
for
state
regulation.
and
it
is
in
that
conservatory
proviso
that
we
find
the
saving
grace
to
opposition
here
because
it
was
there
that
congress
reflected
in
the
statute
that
congressional
history
that
i
just
described.
the
second
aspect
that
i
find
in
the
congressional
history
that
so
pertinent
here
is
that
congress
indicated
plainly
and
unqualifiedly
that
it
knew
of
the
court
decisions
and
the
reach
of
the
states
under
those
court
decisions,
and
specifically
mentioned
the
pennsylvania
gas
company
case
during
the
congressional
debate.
i
think
that
without
dwelling
on
any
long
quotes
from
the
congressional
history,
i
do
have
a
sample
that's
only
one
shot
couple
of
sentences.
that
sums
the
whole
matter
up
here.
in
house
report
for
709,
of
the
75th
congress
which
is,
i
would
say
is
the
foundation
report,
in
all
of
this
congressional
history
and
the
court
will
find
that
this
court
has
many
times
discussed
that
house
report
and
cited
it
in
its
decisions.
in
that
house
report
709,
it
is
said
that
states
have
of
course
for
many
years
regulated
sales
of
natural
gas
to
consumers
in
intrastate
transactions.
the
states
have
also
been
able
to
regulate
sales
to
consumers
even
though
such
sales
are
in
interstate
commerce.
such
sales
being
considered
local
in
character
and
in
the
absence
of
congressional
prohibition
subject
to
state
regulation,
and
they
cite
the
pennsylvania
gas
company
case
and
then
they
say
there
is
no
intention
in
enacting
the
present
legislation
to
disturb
the
states
in
the
exercise
of
such
jurisdiction.
now,
your
honors,
it
seems
to
me
plain
from
that
congressional
history,
that
the
fpc's
claim
to
a
plenary
transportation
jurisdiction,
just
is
completely
contradicted
by
that
history.
because
the
congress
knew
that
these
direct
industrial
sales
were
being
made
through
interstate
facilities,
which
is
what
the
fpc
says
gives
them
this
plenary
authority.
and
yet
they
exempted
in
section
1
(b),
all
of
those
sales
even
though
they
were
through
interstate
facilities.
so,
i
think
the
first
key
furnishes
us
a
rather
adequate
pick
for
the
fpc
coffin.
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
we
are
relying
on
the
exclusion
that
comes
about
from
the
conservatory
proviso
that
commences
with
but
shall
not
apply
to
any
other
transportation
or
sale
of
natural
gas.
now,
we
say
that
that
language
when
compared
with
the
language
of
the
remainder
of
that
section
means
to
reflect
the
congressional
history,
that
i
just
talked
about
of
exempting
all
direct
industrial
sales
even
those
made
through
interstate
facilities.
that's
what
that
language
has
been
held,
i
mean
this
isn't
my
interpretation.
now,
let's
go
to
the
second
factor
i
said
was
a
key
here.
let's
talk
about
for
a
moment
the
decisions
of
this
court.
i
am
speaking
now
again
of
panhandle
indiana
and
transco.
the
panhandle
indiana
case
involved
an
effort
by
a
pipeline
to
make
a
direct
sale
in
indiana.
the
indiana
commission
sought
to
regulate
both
the
rate
of
that
sale
and
the
service
terms.
by
the
way,
you
will
find
in
the
briefs,
although
it
didn't
come
out
in
this
oral
argument
today
that
(inaudible)
company
and
i
think
the
fifth
circuit
does
too
with
the
fpc
when
they
tried
to
talk
about
separating
out
rate
by
equating
it
with
sale.
i
think
it's
perfectly
understandable
from
the
whole,
you
might
say
the
conjures
of
jurisprudence
on
this
whole
subject
that
a
sale
includes
not
only
rate
but
other
terms.
and
their
knowledgeable
former
chairman
mr.
swidler
certainly
admitted
that
during
his
efforts
in
congress.
but
back
to
the
panhandle
case,
in
that
case,
the
state
commission
was
trying
to
regulate
both
the
rate
and
the
service
terms,
which
is
what
is
put
in
this
case
because
we
are
arguing
here
about
curtailment.
the
pipeline
went
in
to
court
and
sought
an
injunction
on
the
ground
that
the
fpc
had
jurisdiction
and
this
court
held
that
the
fpc
had
no
jurisdiction
over
a
direct
industrial
sale
of
the
type
lp&l
has
here,
and
it
said
that
the
state
could
regulate
the
rate
and
the
terms,
the
rate
and
the
terms.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
it
is
from
that
decision,
way
at
the
end
of
the
decision
about
the
last
paragraph
or
two
that
we
find
a
random
sentence
by
mr.
justice
rutledge,
at
lo
and
behold
has
furnished
what
i
called
in
my
brief
the
(inaudible)
of
dictum
that
the
fpc
is
hanging
on
desperately
here.
that's
a
sentence
where
mr.
justice
rutledge
talked
about
interruptions
of
services
and
suggested
that
the
fpc
might
be
able
to
handle
those
in
accommodation
with
the
states.
now,
to
take
that
random
sentence
at
the
end
of
that
decision
after
the
majority,
after
the
holding
had
been
made
that
there
was
this
exemption
of
direct
industrial
sale
in
both
its
rates
and
its
terms,
means,
certainly
that
it
had
to
be
dictum
because
otherwise
it
would
contradict
the
main
holding.
but
it
also
rather
much
picked
our
curiosity
and
we
went
to
the
brief
of
panhandle
that
mr.
justice
rutledge
was
speaking
to
when
he
got
to
that
point.
it
looked
to
me
like
he
was
just
trying
to
tidy
up
this
opinion
and
answer
all
the
panhandle's
little
complaints
and
he
sure
enough
was
doing
that
because
panhandle's
brief
was
arguing
that
there
might
be
a
conflict
between
state
federal
power
commission,
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
the
state
had
jurisdiction
of
the
rates
and
terms.
so,
upon
looking
at
panhandle's
brief
lo
and
behold,
we
found
that
what
they
were
talking
about
and
therefore
what
we
have
to
assume
mr.
justice
rutledge
was
talking
about,
was
a
preposition
of
the
initial
certification
of
a
direct
industrial
sale,
and
unquestionably
nobody
said,
that
there
is
no
quarrel
in
this
case
about
their
initial
certificate
authority
as
a
transportation
matter.
and
that's
what
mr.
justice
rutledge
was
talking
about
and
it
furnishes
the
fpc
no
comfort
here
whatever.
now,
over
to
the
transco
case,
which
i
think
is
really
the
dispositive
situation
here.
that
case
your
honors,
was
a
transportation
case.
in
that
case
an
electric
utility
in
new
york
state
bought
some
gas
down
in
texas
and
wanted
the
pipeline
company
to
haul
it
for
them,
transport
it
for
them
to
new
york.
and
the
matter
came
before
the
fpc
on
a
transportation
certificate,
the
very
thing
that
is
in
dispute
here
and
the
thing
that
they
say,
they
have
a
continuing
jurisdiction
over.
now
what
did
the
fpc
do
there
if
they're
ever
going
to
be
right,
it
would
be
in
this
case,
and
what
happened.
this
court
held
just
as
squarely
as
can
be,
chief
justice
warren
said,
“there
is
only
a
veto
power
in
the
transportation
authority
of
the
fpc,
only
a
veto
power.”
and
of
course
i
think
veto
power
implies
initial
power
anyhow
but
those
are
chief
justice
warren's
exact
words
and
then
in
less
than
one
page
later,
he
said,
that
the
fpc
as
itself
understands
does
not
have
allocation
power,
complete
allocation
power
to
use
his
exact
words.
so,
your
honors,
it
seems
to
us
just
as
plain
as
can
be
from
panhandle
and
transco,
that
you
have
the
second
peg
in
the
fpc
coffin
because
there
is
absolutely
no
authority
in
the
fpc
over
a
direct
industrial
sale
or
the
transportation
of
gas
for
a
direct
industrial
sale.
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
no,
i
think
your
honor
at
that
point
at
the
termination
of
a
contract,
you
have
a
situation
then
developed
that
is
akin
to
a
new
certificate
because
now
you're
going
to
have
a
new
contract,
so
i
think
if
united
took
that
position
--
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
they
said,
we
are
not
going
to
send
you
anything,
i
think
we
would
just
have
to
go
look
for
another
supplier,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
actually,
i
have
my
own
debates
within
myself
as
to
that
to
give
you
an
honest
answer
--
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
i
would
think
probably
not,
mr.
justice
white.
i
would
think
they
might
be
able
to
--
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
haven't
really
thought
it
through
to
find
out
whether
it
helps
me
or
not
actually.
in
other
words
you
are
little
ahead
of
me.
now,
i
think
the
third
key
and
i
will
have
to
try
to
travel
through
this
rather
quickly
although,
it's
halting
sort
of
thing
and
that
third
key
is
the
fpc
actions
themselves
and
to
try
to
briefly
cover
it
up,
i
will
put
it
this
way.
in
the
city
of
hastings
case
back
in
1954
in
footnote
3
of
that
case,
the
court
commented
on
the
commission's
statement
that
it
had
been
to
congress,
to
recommend
that
it
“extend
our
jurisdiction
over
interstate
sales
by
natural
gas
companies
to
include
direct
sales
to
industries
and
sales
to
utilities
which
are
not
for
resale.”
that's
the
case
you
have
before
you
today,
that's
us.
the
commission
obviously
didn't
get
that
sort
of
authority,
nothing
had
been
done
to
the
act
since
1954
and
then
up
to
1963
we
come,
and
we
find
that,
in
1963,
mr.
swidler
who
was
then
the
chairman
of
the
fpc
and
who
has
a
reputation
as
a
very
knowledgeable
man
in
this
field,
had
this
to
say
to
congress.
he
is
talking
now
to
congress
and
he
says,
“under
existing
law,
the
commission's
authority
is
limited
to
sales
for
resale
in
interstate
commerce.
hence
the
price
and
other
terms,”
that's
my
emphasis,
“and
other
terms
of
a
direct
sale
by
pipeline
to
an
industrial
customer,”
and
that's
us,
“outside
this
field
of
this
commission's
regulatory
authority.”
that's
the
chairman
himself
speaking
and
he
then
went
on
to
ask
congress,
to
give
them
the
authority
to
require
that
interstate
industrial
gas
sales,
that's
us,
will
be
made
at
such
prices
and
on
such
terms
as
to
realize
the
potential
benefits
of
such
sales
to
both
industrial
and
domestic
consumers
and
congress
turned
him
down.
so,
now
we
come
up
to
1970
and
we
are
getting
rather
close
up
to
date,
and
in
1970,
this
same
commission
that's
appearing
before
this
court
and
saying
we
have
got
this
plenary
authority,
said
to
congress
that
it's
recommendation
was
that
congress
enact
“a
new
subsection
to
section
7
of
the
natural
gas
act,
that
would
enable
the
commission
to
determine
when
an
emergency
exists,
so
as
to
require
and
now
i
am
emphasizing
lower
curtailment
and
allocation,”
that's
what's
being
attempted
here.
low
curtailment
and
allocation
of
gas
by
any
gas
company
whether
or
not
it
is
otherwise
subject
to
the
commission
jurisdiction.
now,
the
fpc
says
in
its
reply
brief
that
the
effort
there
was
to
reach
distribution
companies
in
intra
state
pipelines.
now,
your
honors
with
all
respect
to
the
fpc
and
i
am
not
saying
this
meanly
but
that's
just
solemn
nonsense
on
their
part
because
they
already
have
a
reach
of
distribution
companies
by
way
of
their
authority
over
the
pipelines.
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
i
think
they
are
a
very
carefully
phrased
reservation
of
the
powers
to
the
states,
so
that
if
you
could
look
at
it
this
way
and
i
am
not
saying
that
it's
the
only
way
to
look
at
it,
but
you
could
look
at
it
as
though
those
first
portions
of
that
section
or
the
statement
of
jurisdiction
by
the
fpc,
and
that
the
latter
conservatory
proviso
is
to
indicate
which
portions
of
that
upper
part
are
actually
reserved
to
the
states.
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
i
am
not
sure,
i
understand
that
question,
your
honor,
if
you
mean
if
the
two
sections
suppose
were
separated?
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
oh,
yes,
i
do
think
that.
now,
i
think
i
had
just
about
finished
saying
what
i
had
to
say
about
the
fpc
actions
themselves
of
going
to
congress
to
ask
for
an
authority
that
they
are
now
saying
to
this
court
that
they
have,
and
i
think
that
the
best
evidence
of
an
agency's
lack
of
jurisdiction
is
the
agency's
own
admission
of
that
lack
of
jurisdiction.
so
i
consider
that
the
third
peg
in
the
fpc
coffin
here,
and
i
turn
at
that
point
to
the
issue
involved
in
what
is
known
as
a
green
system.
and
if
your
honors
would
refer
to
the
first
appendix
in
our
brief
which
is
about
midway,
it's
a
foldout
map
and
i
assure
to
court
that
we
have
no
idea
here
of
emulating
any
popular
magazine.
but
this
foldout
map
shows,
i
think
the
location
and
the
configuration
of
the
green
system
very
clearly.
and
your
honors
will
note
that
the
green
system
lies
in
the
very
deep
part
of
the,
south
part
of
louisiana,
which
means
you
are
really
getting
down
south.
and
that
green
system,
your
honors,
is
a
system
that
was
designed
and
constructed
to
be
an
intrastate
system,
as
you
can
see
merely
by
looking
at
it.
and
it's
a
self-contained
separate
system,
and
in
the
court
below,
by
united's
own
witnesses,
we
were
able
to
prove
that
this
line
is
located
wholly
in
louisiana,
the
gas
going
into
that
launch
produced
wholly
in
louisiana.
it's
shipped
wholly
in
louisiana,
it's
consumed
wholly
in
louisiana.
we
also
show
that
there
was
2.6%
or
2.7%
of
gas
from
what's
known
as
a
black
system,
which
is
an
interstate
line
nearby.
it
was
artificially
injected
into
that
green
system
by
united
in
1970,
and
i
say
artificially
for
this
reason,
the
proof
also
shows
that
they
need
not
have
put
that
black
gas
into
the
green
system.
and
indeed
one
of
their
wholly
owned
subsidiary
companies
breached
some
of
its
contracts
in
not
putting
enough
green
gas
into
the
system.
and
so
you
had
a
situation
there
where
practically
everything
about
it
is
intrastate.
the
fifth
circuit
looked
at
that
whole
situation
and
they
on
the
teachings
of
the
lovaca
case
out
of
this
court,
decided
not
as
fpc
has
said
to
the
court
today
that
this
matter
was
de
minimis.
it's
2.6%,
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
holding
actually.
the
court
will
find
upon
reading
the
fifth
circuit
decision
that
the
decision
on
the
green
system
went
off
on
what
is
known
as
the
channel
of
constant
flow
which
is
a
teaching
coming
out
of
the
lovaca
case,
also
impliedly
out
of
amerada.
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
not
at
all,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
you
have
in
the
case
of
the
green
system,
a
wholly
different
channel,
there
is
a
different
pressure
from
the
black
system.
unlike
in
florida
power
where
you
had
some
interconnections,
you
see
electricity
is
traveling
on
the
same
level,
let's
put
it
that
way.
here,
the
pressure
in
the
green
system
is
at
a
wholly
different
pressure
than
the
black
system,
so
in
order
to
put
gas
from
the
black
system
into
the
green
system,
you
have
to
manipulate
valves
and
push
it
into
that
system,
and
you
can't
get
it
back
out
of
the
green
system
because
the
pressure
is
low.
so,
this
just
guides
you
naturally
into
this
theory
of
the
channel
of
constant
flow
and
that's
what
the
fifth
circuit
went
off
on
which
was
lovaca
all
over
again.
finally,
on
the
green
system,
i
think
we
just
get
down
to
a
case
of
common
sense,
your
honors.
here
is
a
pipeline
looking
at
that
map
you
see
where
it
is,
it's
laying
right
on
top
of
some
of
the
largest
natural
gas
fields
in
the
western
hemisphere.
and
yet
here,
are
people
telling
us
that
they
have
got
to
inject
some
black
gas,
some
interstate
gas
into
this
green
system
in
order
to
make
it
viable,
that's
like
chopping
ice
in
greenland
and
shipping
it
to
alaska.
there's
just
no
sense
to
that
sort
of
--
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
mr.
justice
white,
the
fpc
voluntarily
walked
into
this
cases.
this
case
started
out
as
a
simple
injunction
suit
that
pulls
our
contract.
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
even
if
it
had
not
walked
into
it,
i
would
say
to
you
that
once
it
got
into
it
and
took
part
then
the
panhandle
case
applies
--
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
well,
if
it
never
was
in
it,
i
don't
think
you
would
ever
have
the
question
of
primary
jurisdiction
arise.
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
it
might
have
made
a
difference.
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
i
don't
think
it
would
have
been,
but
it
might
have.
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
i
think
it
did
in
terms
of
what
has
actually
happened
here,
yes,
your
honor.
i
imagine
my
time
since
i
see
the
white
line
is
apparently
just
about
to
expire,
i
will
just
close
mr.
chief
justice
by
saying
to
the
court
that
what
we
are
saying
in
essence
here
and
all
that
we
are
saying
is
that
we
think
this
court
should
stick
by
the
duality
of
regulation
that
congress
prescribed,
that
was
put
into
the
act
and
that
this
court
went
by
in
transco
and
panhandle.
i
thank
you.
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
lp&l's
affirmative
position
in
this
case
is
that
its
contracts
with
united
or
direct
sales
contract,
direct
industrial
sales
contracts
exempt
under
section
1
(b)
of
the
act.
the
fifth
circuit
has
so
held,
that's
the
decision
here
on
for
review.
now
the
fpc
in
order
to
scrape
that
holding
is
arguing
that
it
has
a
plenary
jurisdiction
under
what
it
terms
its
transportation
authority,
and
it
points
to
the
first
part
of
section
1
(b)
to
say
that
that's
where
its
transportation
authority
resides.
now,
our
brief
we
believe
adequately
talked
about
the
direct
sale
aspects
and
we
believe
the
fifth
circuit
opinion
adequately
speaks
to
that
subject
and
we're
going
to
spend
our
time
today
in
rebutting
that
the
position
that
the
fpc
takes
about
this
plenary
transportation
authority.
i
think
that
while
there
is
a
lot
of
chaff
in
this
case,
we
can
get
to
the
essence
very
quickly
by
my
saying
that
in
order
to
determine
the
jurisdiction
here,
all
we
have
to
look
at
is
three
key
factors.
and
i'm
not
going
to
say
as
mr.
plotkin
said
earlier
that
this
is
a
simple
issue.
but
i
believe
that
if
we
look
at
the
three
factors
it
will
simplify
the
case
for
the
court.
those
three
factors
are,
first
of
all,
the
congressional
history.
and
in
this
case
i
don't
believe
i
can
emphasize
too
strongly,
the
effect
of
that
congressional
history
on
this
whole
matter.
the
second
thing
is
the
decisions
of
this
court,
and
i'm
speaking
now
of
the
panhandle
indiana
case,
337
and
the
transco
case
in
365
us.
and
the
third
is
the
actions
of
the
fpc
itself.
now,
addressing
myself
to
the
congressional
history
first
and
i'll
dwell
on
it
a
little
bit
because
as
i
said
it
is
so
important
to
this
whole
matter.
we
did
a
rather
comprehensive
study
of
that
legislative
history
and
it
became
more
interesting
all
along,
because
we
found
that
the
history
here
was
taking
place
during
1936,
1937
and
1938,
which
i
believe
we
all
will
agree
were
the
high
watermarks
of
the
roosevelt
administration
in
terms
of
the
passage
of
regulatory
legislation.
and
an
example
of
that
i
would
say
is
the
national
labor
relations
act,
which
is
i
think
the
court
knows
so
well
has
an
exclusive
or
peremptory
nature
to
it.
and
i
think
all
of
that
legislation
at
that
time
was
of
the
same
type
with
the
sole
exception
of
this
natural
gas
act.
that's
an
interesting
thing
about
this
congressional
history
is
that
congress
and
apparently
it
was
getting
a
lot
of
heat,
i
would
say,
from
the
national
association
of
railroad
and
utilities
commission
as
the
representatives
of
the
state
authorities.
and
speaking
for
the
states,
they
made
a
strong
case
for
the
proposition
of
dual
regulation
here.
and
as
a
result,
you
had
--
running
like
a
thread
through
the
congressional
history,
the
proposition
that
we
would
have
dual
regulation
and
we
were
going
to
leave
to
the
states,
those
things
that
the
states
had
already
been
regulating
and
that
congress
felt
they
could
reach
and
the
courts
felt
they
could
reach.
now
section
1
(b)
reflects
that
history
because
section
1
(b)
really
is
a
two
part
sort
of
statute.
in
the
first
part
of
the
statute,
it
tells
what
matters
will
fall
into
the
ambit
of
fpc
jurisdiction,
and
then
it
has
a
'but'
clause
in
it,
a
conservatory
proviso
which
reserves
to
the
states
those
things
that
are
to
be
for
state
regulation.
and
it
is
in
that
conservatory
proviso
that
we
find
the
saving
grace
to
opposition
here
because
it
was
there
that
congress
reflected
in
the
statute
that
congressional
history
that
i
just
described.
the
second
aspect
that
i
find
in
the
congressional
history
that
so
pertinent
here
is
that
congress
indicated
plainly
and
unqualifiedly
that
it
knew
of
the
court
decisions
and
the
reach
of
the
states
under
those
court
decisions,
and
specifically
mentioned
the
pennsylvania
gas
company
case
during
the
congressional
debate.
i
think
that
without
dwelling
on
any
long
quotes
from
the
congressional
history,
i
do
have
a
sample
that's
only
one
shot
couple
of
sentences.
that
sums
the
whole
matter
up
here.
in
house
report
for
709,
of
the
75th
congress
which
is,
i
would
say
is
the
foundation
report,
in
all
of
this
congressional
history
and
the
court
will
find
that
this
court
has
many
times
discussed
that
house
report
and
cited
it
in
its
decisions.
in
that
house
report
709,
it
is
said
that
states
have
of
course
for
many
years
regulated
sales
of
natural
gas
to
consumers
in
intrastate
transactions.
the
states
have
also
been
able
to
regulate
sales
to
consumers
even
though
such
sales
are
in
interstate
commerce.
such
sales
being
considered
local
in
character
and
in
the
absence
of
congressional
prohibition
subject
to
state
regulation,
and
they
cite
the
pennsylvania
gas
company
case
and
then
they
say
there
is
no
intention
in
enacting
the
present
legislation
to
disturb
the
states
in
the
exercise
of
such
jurisdiction.
now,
your
honors,
it
seems
to
me
plain
from
that
congressional
history,
that
the
fpc's
claim
to
a
plenary
transportation
jurisdiction,
just
is
completely
contradicted
by
that
history.
because
the
congress
knew
that
these
direct
industrial
sales
were
being
made
through
interstate
facilities,
which
is
what
the
fpc
says
gives
them
this
plenary
authority.
and
yet
they
exempted
in
section
1
(b),
all
of
those
sales
even
though
they
were
through
interstate
facilities.
so,
i
think
the
first
key
furnishes
us
a
rather
adequate
pick
for
the
fpc
coffin.
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
we
are
relying
on
the
exclusion
that
comes
about
from
the
conservatory
proviso
that
commences
with
but
shall
not
apply
to
any
other
transportation
or
sale
of
natural
gas.
now,
we
say
that
that
language
when
compared
with
the
language
of
the
remainder
of
that
section
means
to
reflect
the
congressional
history,
that
i
just
talked
about
of
exempting
all
direct
industrial
sales
even
those
made
through
interstate
facilities.
that's
what
that
language
has
been
held,
i
mean
this
isn't
my
interpretation.
now,
let's
go
to
the
second
factor
i
said
was
a
key
here.
let's
talk
about
for
a
moment
the
decisions
of
this
court.
i
am
speaking
now
again
of
panhandle
indiana
and
transco.
the
panhandle
indiana
case
involved
an
effort
by
a
pipeline
to
make
a
direct
sale
in
indiana.
the
indiana
commission
sought
to
regulate
both
the
rate
of
that
sale
and
the
service
terms.
by
the
way,
you
will
find
in
the
briefs,
although
it
didn't
come
out
in
this
oral
argument
today
that
(inaudible)
company
and
i
think
the
fifth
circuit
does
too
with
the
fpc
when
they
tried
to
talk
about
separating
out
rate
by
equating
it
with
sale.
i
think
it's
perfectly
understandable
from
the
whole,
you
might
say
the
conjures
of
jurisprudence
on
this
whole
subject
that
a
sale
includes
not
only
rate
but
other
terms.
and
their
knowledgeable
former
chairman
mr.
swidler
certainly
admitted
that
during
his
efforts
in
congress.
but
back
to
the
panhandle
case,
in
that
case,
the
state
commission
was
trying
to
regulate
both
the
rate
and
the
service
terms,
which
is
what
is
put
in
this
case
because
we
are
arguing
here
about
curtailment.
the
pipeline
went
in
to
court
and
sought
an
injunction
on
the
ground
that
the
fpc
had
jurisdiction
and
this
court
held
that
the
fpc
had
no
jurisdiction
over
a
direct
industrial
sale
of
the
type
lp&l
has
here,
and
it
said
that
the
state
could
regulate
the
rate
and
the
terms,
the
rate
and
the
terms.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
it
is
from
that
decision,
way
at
the
end
of
the
decision
about
the
last
paragraph
or
two
that
we
find
a
random
sentence
by
mr.
justice
rutledge,
at
lo
and
behold
has
furnished
what
i
called
in
my
brief
the
(inaudible)
of
dictum
that
the
fpc
is
hanging
on
desperately
here.
that's
a
sentence
where
mr.
justice
rutledge
talked
about
interruptions
of
services
and
suggested
that
the
fpc
might
be
able
to
handle
those
in
accommodation
with
the
states.
now,
to
take
that
random
sentence
at
the
end
of
that
decision
after
the
majority,
after
the
holding
had
been
made
that
there
was
this
exemption
of
direct
industrial
sale
in
both
its
rates
and
its
terms,
means,
certainly
that
it
had
to
be
dictum
because
otherwise
it
would
contradict
the
main
holding.
but
it
also
rather
much
picked
our
curiosity
and
we
went
to
the
brief
of
panhandle
that
mr.
justice
rutledge
was
speaking
to
when
he
got
to
that
point.
it
looked
to
me
like
he
was
just
trying
to
tidy
up
this
opinion
and
answer
all
the
panhandle's
little
complaints
and
he
sure
enough
was
doing
that
because
panhandle's
brief
was
arguing
that
there
might
be
a
conflict
between
state
federal
power
commission,
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
the
state
had
jurisdiction
of
the
rates
and
terms.
so,
upon
looking
at
panhandle's
brief
lo
and
behold,
we
found
that
what
they
were
talking
about
and
therefore
what
we
have
to
assume
mr.
justice
rutledge
was
talking
about,
was
a
preposition
of
the
initial
certification
of
a
direct
industrial
sale,
and
unquestionably
nobody
said,
that
there
is
no
quarrel
in
this
case
about
their
initial
certificate
authority
as
a
transportation
matter.
and
that's
what
mr.
justice
rutledge
was
talking
about
and
it
furnishes
the
fpc
no
comfort
here
whatever.
now,
over
to
the
transco
case,
which
i
think
is
really
the
dispositive
situation
here.
that
case
your
honors,
was
a
transportation
case.
in
that
case
an
electric
utility
in
new
york
state
bought
some
gas
down
in
texas
and
wanted
the
pipeline
company
to
haul
it
for
them,
transport
it
for
them
to
new
york.
and
the
matter
came
before
the
fpc
on
a
transportation
certificate,
the
very
thing
that
is
in
dispute
here
and
the
thing
that
they
say,
they
have
a
continuing
jurisdiction
over.
now
what
did
the
fpc
do
there
if
they're
ever
going
to
be
right,
it
would
be
in
this
case,
and
what
happened.
this
court
held
just
as
squarely
as
can
be,
chief
justice
warren
said,
“there
is
only
a
veto
power
in
the
transportation
authority
of
the
fpc,
only
a
veto
power.”
and
of
course
i
think
veto
power
implies
initial
power
anyhow
but
those
are
chief
justice
warren's
exact
words
and
then
in
less
than
one
page
later,
he
said,
that
the
fpc
as
itself
understands
does
not
have
allocation
power,
complete
allocation
power
to
use
his
exact
words.
so,
your
honors,
it
seems
to
us
just
as
plain
as
can
be
from
panhandle
and
transco,
that
you
have
the
second
peg
in
the
fpc
coffin
because
there
is
absolutely
no
authority
in
the
fpc
over
a
direct
industrial
sale
or
the
transportation
of
gas
for
a
direct
industrial
sale.
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
no,
i
think
your
honor
at
that
point
at
the
termination
of
a
contract,
you
have
a
situation
then
developed
that
is
akin
to
a
new
certificate
because
now
you're
going
to
have
a
new
contract,
so
i
think
if
united
took
that
position
--
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
they
said,
we
are
not
going
to
send
you
anything,
i
think
we
would
just
have
to
go
look
for
another
supplier,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
actually,
i
have
my
own
debates
within
myself
as
to
that
to
give
you
an
honest
answer
--
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
i
would
think
probably
not,
mr.
justice
white.
i
would
think
they
might
be
able
to
--
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
haven't
really
thought
it
through
to
find
out
whether
it
helps
me
or
not
actually.
in
other
words
you
are
little
ahead
of
me.
now,
i
think
the
third
key
and
i
will
have
to
try
to
travel
through
this
rather
quickly
although,
it's
halting
sort
of
thing
and
that
third
key
is
the
fpc
actions
themselves
and
to
try
to
briefly
cover
it
up,
i
will
put
it
this
way.
in
the
city
of
hastings
case
back
in
1954
in
footnote
3
of
that
case,
the
court
commented
on
the
commission's
statement
that
it
had
been
to
congress,
to
recommend
that
it
“extend
our
jurisdiction
over
interstate
sales
by
natural
gas
companies
to
include
direct
sales
to
industries
and
sales
to
utilities
which
are
not
for
resale.”
that's
the
case
you
have
before
you
today,
that's
us.
the
commission
obviously
didn't
get
that
sort
of
authority,
nothing
had
been
done
to
the
act
since
1954
and
then
up
to
1963
we
come,
and
we
find
that,
in
1963,
mr.
swidler
who
was
then
the
chairman
of
the
fpc
and
who
has
a
reputation
as
a
very
knowledgeable
man
in
this
field,
had
this
to
say
to
congress.
he
is
talking
now
to
congress
and
he
says,
“under
existing
law,
the
commission's
authority
is
limited
to
sales
for
resale
in
interstate
commerce.
hence
the
price
and
other
terms,”
that's
my
emphasis,
“and
other
terms
of
a
direct
sale
by
pipeline
to
an
industrial
customer,”
and
that's
us,
“outside
this
field
of
this
commission's
regulatory
authority.”
that's
the
chairman
himself
speaking
and
he
then
went
on
to
ask
congress,
to
give
them
the
authority
to
require
that
interstate
industrial
gas
sales,
that's
us,
will
be
made
at
such
prices
and
on
such
terms
as
to
realize
the
potential
benefits
of
such
sales
to
both
industrial
and
domestic
consumers
and
congress
turned
him
down.
so,
now
we
come
up
to
1970
and
we
are
getting
rather
close
up
to
date,
and
in
1970,
this
same
commission
that's
appearing
before
this
court
and
saying
we
have
got
this
plenary
authority,
said
to
congress
that
it's
recommendation
was
that
congress
enact
“a
new
subsection
to
section
7
of
the
natural
gas
act,
that
would
enable
the
commission
to
determine
when
an
emergency
exists,
so
as
to
require
and
now
i
am
emphasizing
lower
curtailment
and
allocation,”
that's
what's
being
attempted
here.
low
curtailment
and
allocation
of
gas
by
any
gas
company
whether
or
not
it
is
otherwise
subject
to
the
commission
jurisdiction.
now,
the
fpc
says
in
its
reply
brief
that
the
effort
there
was
to
reach
distribution
companies
in
intra
state
pipelines.
now,
your
honors
with
all
respect
to
the
fpc
and
i
am
not
saying
this
meanly
but
that's
just
solemn
nonsense
on
their
part
because
they
already
have
a
reach
of
distribution
companies
by
way
of
their
authority
over
the
pipelines.
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
i
think
they
are
a
very
carefully
phrased
reservation
of
the
powers
to
the
states,
so
that
if
you
could
look
at
it
this
way
and
i
am
not
saying
that
it's
the
only
way
to
look
at
it,
but
you
could
look
at
it
as
though
those
first
portions
of
that
section
or
the
statement
of
jurisdiction
by
the
fpc,
and
that
the
latter
conservatory
proviso
is
to
indicate
which
portions
of
that
upper
part
are
actually
reserved
to
the
states.
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
i
am
not
sure,
i
understand
that
question,
your
honor,
if
you
mean
if
the
two
sections
suppose
were
separated?
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
oh,
yes,
i
do
think
that.
now,
i
think
i
had
just
about
finished
saying
what
i
had
to
say
about
the
fpc
actions
themselves
of
going
to
congress
to
ask
for
an
authority
that
they
are
now
saying
to
this
court
that
they
have,
and
i
think
that
the
best
evidence
of
an
agency's
lack
of
jurisdiction
is
the
agency's
own
admission
of
that
lack
of
jurisdiction.
so
i
consider
that
the
third
peg
in
the
fpc
coffin
here,
and
i
turn
at
that
point
to
the
issue
involved
in
what
is
known
as
a
green
system.
and
if
your
honors
would
refer
to
the
first
appendix
in
our
brief
which
is
about
midway,
it's
a
foldout
map
and
i
assure
to
court
that
we
have
no
idea
here
of
emulating
any
popular
magazine.
but
this
foldout
map
shows,
i
think
the
location
and
the
configuration
of
the
green
system
very
clearly.
and
your
honors
will
note
that
the
green
system
lies
in
the
very
deep
part
of
the,
south
part
of
louisiana,
which
means
you
are
really
getting
down
south.
and
that
green
system,
your
honors,
is
a
system
that
was
designed
and
constructed
to
be
an
intrastate
system,
as
you
can
see
merely
by
looking
at
it.
and
it's
a
self-contained
separate
system,
and
in
the
court
below,
by
united's
own
witnesses,
we
were
able
to
prove
that
this
line
is
located
wholly
in
louisiana,
the
gas
going
into
that
launch
produced
wholly
in
louisiana.
it's
shipped
wholly
in
louisiana,
it's
consumed
wholly
in
louisiana.
we
also
show
that
there
was
2.6%
or
2.7%
of
gas
from
what's
known
as
a
black
system,
which
is
an
interstate
line
nearby.
it
was
artificially
injected
into
that
green
system
by
united
in
1970,
and
i
say
artificially
for
this
reason,
the
proof
also
shows
that
they
need
not
have
put
that
black
gas
into
the
green
system.
and
indeed
one
of
their
wholly
owned
subsidiary
companies
breached
some
of
its
contracts
in
not
putting
enough
green
gas
into
the
system.
and
so
you
had
a
situation
there
where
practically
everything
about
it
is
intrastate.
the
fifth
circuit
looked
at
that
whole
situation
and
they
on
the
teachings
of
the
lovaca
case
out
of
this
court,
decided
not
as
fpc
has
said
to
the
court
today
that
this
matter
was
de
minimis.
it's
2.6%,
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
holding
actually.
the
court
will
find
upon
reading
the
fifth
circuit
decision
that
the
decision
on
the
green
system
went
off
on
what
is
known
as
the
channel
of
constant
flow
which
is
a
teaching
coming
out
of
the
lovaca
case,
also
impliedly
out
of
amerada.
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
not
at
all,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
you
have
in
the
case
of
the
green
system,
a
wholly
different
channel,
there
is
a
different
pressure
from
the
black
system.
unlike
in
florida
power
where
you
had
some
interconnections,
you
see
electricity
is
traveling
on
the
same
level,
let's
put
it
that
way.
here,
the
pressure
in
the
green
system
is
at
a
wholly
different
pressure
than
the
black
system,
so
in
order
to
put
gas
from
the
black
system
into
the
green
system,
you
have
to
manipulate
valves
and
push
it
into
that
system,
and
you
can't
get
it
back
out
of
the
green
system
because
the
pressure
is
low.
so,
this
just
guides
you
naturally
into
this
theory
of
the
channel
of
constant
flow
and
that's
what
the
fifth
circuit
went
off
on
which
was
lovaca
all
over
again.
finally,
on
the
green
system,
i
think
we
just
get
down
to
a
case
of
common
sense,
your
honors.
here
is
a
pipeline
looking
at
that
map
you
see
where
it
is,
it's
laying
right
on
top
of
some
of
the
largest
natural
gas
fields
in
the
western
hemisphere.
and
yet
here,
are
people
telling
us
that
they
have
got
to
inject
some
black
gas,
some
interstate
gas
into
this
green
system
in
order
to
make
it
viable,
that's
like
chopping
ice
in
greenland
and
shipping
it
to
alaska.
there's
just
no
sense
to
that
sort
of
--
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
mr.
justice
white,
the
fpc
voluntarily
walked
into
this
cases.
this
case
started
out
as
a
simple
injunction
suit
that
pulls
our
contract.
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
even
if
it
had
not
walked
into
it,
i
would
say
to
you
that
once
it
got
into
it
and
took
part
then
the
panhandle
case
applies
--
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
well,
if
it
never
was
in
it,
i
don't
think
you
would
ever
have
the
question
of
primary
jurisdiction
arise.
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
it
might
have
made
a
difference.
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
i
don't
think
it
would
have
been,
but
it
might
have.
mr.
andrew
p.
carter
i
think
it
did
in
terms
of
what
has
actually
happened
here,
yes,
your
honor.
i
imagine
my
time
since
i
see
the
white
line
is
apparently
just
about
to
expire,
i
will
just
close
mr.
chief
justice
by
saying
to
the
court
that
what
we
are
saying
in
essence
here
and
all
that
we
are
saying
is
that
we
think
this
court
should
stick
by
the
duality
of
regulation
that
congress
prescribed,
that
was
put
into
the
act
and
that
this
court
went
by
in
transco
and
panhandle.
i
thank
you.
