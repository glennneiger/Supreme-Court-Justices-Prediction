justice
byron
r.
white
it
held
that
the
commission
had
the
power
neither
under
1
(b)
4
and
5,
nor
under
section
7
or
8.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh
yes,
but
they
held
that
they
cannot
have
a
curtailment
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
section
7.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
wasn't
one
of
the
claims
before
the
fifth
circuit
that
there
could
be
a
curtailment
sort
of
abandonment
under
section
7?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
rejected
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
united
have
to
get
to
consent
of
the
federal
power
commission
to
curtail
transportation
to
lp&l?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
what
section?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
there
was
no
contract
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
have
just
been
selling
gas
to
lp&l
over
a
long
period
of
time,
and
they
suddenly
decided
they
want
to
sell
it
all
to,
to
transport
it
farther
east.
justice
byron
r.
white
will
they
have
to
get
consent?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
what
section?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
they
have
ordered
but
that's
sort
of
assuming
the
answer
to
this
case,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
forbid
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
united
have
to
get
consent
from
the
federal
power
commission
if
it
cut
down
its
deliveries
to
its
domestic,
to
the
utilities
for
the
resale?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
one
way
or
another,
if
they
can't
satisfy
both
direct
users
then
the
utility
customers
are
going
to
have
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
somebody
is
going
to
have
to
go
to
the
commission?
justice
byron
r.
white
one
way
or
the
other?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
are
some
contract
provisions
on
the
contract
sale
under
which
united
could
curtail
without
coming
in
the
commission?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
a
court
could
decide
that
united
had
to
satisfy
deliveries
to
lp&l
and
the
commission
could
refuse
to
give
united
the
permission
to
cut
down
its
gas
deliveries
to
the
utility
resale.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly
the
same
circumstances.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
mean
to
commission
and
the
courts
could
decide
it
differently?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
that
if
the
contract
here
between
united
and
lp&l
had
expired
and
united
said
to
lp&l
we
are
only
going
to
send
you
half
as
much
gas
from
now
on,
that
ceased
transporting
that
much
to
lp&l
that
you
say
the
united
wouldn't
have
to
get
permission
from
anybody?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
united
said,
we
aren't
going
to
send
you
anything?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
as
far
as
i
know
you
would
probably
have
to
but
wouldn't
united
have
to
get
consent
of
the
fpc
before
it
terminated
this
transportation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
mean
within
the
transco
and
i
suppose
that
would
be
a
veto
if
the
fpc
might
say,
--
if
lp&l
came
up
to
the
commissioner
and
says,
please
don't
give
them
consent,
you
would
say,
would
the
fpc
have
veto
power
over
that
termination?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
must
say
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
court's
power
to
do
this
ab
initio
in
a
suit
like
this
rather
than
on
review
of
the
power
commission?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
it
hadn't
walked
into
it,
and
the
united
would
have
had
to
plead
the
primary
jurisdiction.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
it
never
was
in
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
know,
united
easily
could
have
raised
it.
so
it's
usually
raised.
let's
assume
united
had
raised
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
could
have
been
arguable
primary
jurisdiction
in
the
commission?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
any
event
the
commissions
coming
in
and
litigating
the
issue
curative
--
justice
byron
r.
white
did
united
itself
come
into
this
or
prior
to
the
fpc?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
under
what
section
did
it
wrote
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
kind
of
power
the
commission
did
it
asked
to
be
invoked?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
said,
they
already
had
a
curtailment
plan?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
long
had
that
been
filed?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
held
that
the
commission
had
the
power
neither
under
1
(b)
4
and
5,
nor
under
section
7
or
8.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh
yes,
but
they
held
that
they
cannot
have
a
curtailment
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
section
7.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron

i
