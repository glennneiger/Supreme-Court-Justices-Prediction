mr.
william
c.
harvin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
while
the
question
before
the
court
is
a
limited
one
of
the
curtailment
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
power
commission,
the
commission
has
graciously
conceded
five
minutes
of
this
presentation
to
united,
its
co-petitioner
here
to
speak
to
a
few
of
the
practical
aspects
of
this
problem
that
we
hope
the
court
will
keep
in
its
mind
as
it
decides
the
question
of
fpc
curtailment
jurisdiction
or
not.
united
is
an
interstate
gas
transmission
system
covering
the
states
of
texas,
louisiana,
mississippi,
alabama,
and
florida,
and
supplying
some
five
other
jurisdictional
pipelines
which
in
turn
supply
much
of
the
gas,
that's
eventually
consumed
in
the
mid-west
and
in
the
east.
in
addition
to
people
such
as
louisiana
power
and
light
and
in
addition
to
those
other
jurisdictional
pipeline
customers,
we
serve
over
200
other
direct
industrial
customers
including
some
14
different
power
plants
such
as
louisiana
power
and
light.
we
serve
over
100
distribution
companies
that
in
turn
supply
gas
to
some
800
different
communities.
and
of
extreme
significance
is
the
fact
that
some
37%
of
our
volume
is
taken
up
in
these
direct
industrial
sales
and
this
makes
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
excluding
direct
industrial
sales
from
the
curtailment
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
power
commission,
extremely
important
not
only
to
united
but
to
united's
other
customers
as
well,
or
it's
undisputed
that
the
total
gas
requirements
of
all
of
united's
customers
just
cannot
be
met
irrespective
of
what
this
court
decides
about
whether
the
fpc
has
curtailment
jurisdiction
or
not.
the
electrical
utilities
and
the
other
direct
industrial
customers
all
assert
different
theories
about
why
they
should
have
priority
to
get
their
full
requirements,
and
they
do
so
without
regard
to
the
impact
or
effect
that
these
positions
they
are
taking
may
have
on
the
distribution
companies
and
the
domestic
consumers
along
the
length
and
the
breadth
or
our
system.
well,
if
these
conflicting
interests
are
to
be
resolved
in
terms
of
a
system
wide
shortage
without
effective
regulation,
the
priorities
will
have
to
be
based
on
such
factors
as
who
has
the
physical
capacity
by
virtue
of
his
geographical
location
close
to
the
source
of
supply
of
united's
gas,
or
who
is
able
to
get
to
the
courthouse
first
and
then
join
united's
reduction
of
deliveries.
gas
beyond
curtailed
levels
that's
obtained
by
such
means
is
simply
going
to
be
taken
away
from
others
of
united's
customers.
so
we
get
right
down
to
the
question
of
who
is
going
to
determine
the
priorities
to
an
interstate
pipelines
limited
supplies
of
gas
among
a
variety
of
customers
in
many,
many
states.
well,
reducing
deliveries
to
industrial
customers
as
maybe
necessary
to
meet
human
needs
or
requirements,
is
basically
a
matter
of
interrupting
service,
not
abandoning
contracts.
and
it
calls
for
interruption
of
services
all
along
the
interstate
pipeline
system.
and
this
court
had
announced
on
two
occasions
that
interrupting
service
was
a
matter
largely
related
to
the
transportation
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
power
commission.
thus
within
its
jurisdiction,
that
was
the
procedure
united
followed
to
implement
and
seek
fpc
approval
of
a
curtailment
program.
a
curtailment
which
had
its
impact
on
industrial
sales.
it
has
thus
far
had
no
impact
and
foreseeably
and
hopefully
will
have
no
impact
on
domestic
consumers.
the
same
is
true
with
respect
to
the
gas
that's
supplied
to
the
power
plants.
their
deliveries
are
reduced
to
the
extent
that
they
use
gas
for
the
generation
of
electricity
for
industrial
consumption,
but
their
human
needs
requirements
are
supplied
without
any
reduction
whatsoever.
under
fpc
jurisdiction,
we
believe
that
this
program
of
orderly
reduction
of
deliveries
can
be
handled
in
the
public
interest.
it
can
be
handled
uniformly,
whether
exceptional
circumstances
that
apply
to
one
customer,
they
can
be
viewed
in
light
of
the
interests
of
all
the
customers.
state
regulatory
agencies
for
practical
and
legal
purposes
are
not
equipped
to
handle
such
problems
of
an
interstate
pipeline
system
and
to
allow
it
to
be
conducted
by
random
litigation
and
conflicting
court
decisions
based
upon
different
facts
relating
to
different
special
interests
in
different
states
has
put
us
in
a
complete
state
of
chaos
in
the
gas
industry.
this
is
not
to
suggest
that
need
creates
federal
power
and
the
curtailment
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
power
commission.
it
is
to
suggest
that
since
congress
specifically
wanted
to
avoid
any
regulatory
gap
and
since
the
job
cannot
be
done
at
the
local
and
the
state
level,
that
the
logical
place
for
it
to
be
done
is
within
the
parameters
of
the
natural
gas
act
by
the
federal
power
commission.
