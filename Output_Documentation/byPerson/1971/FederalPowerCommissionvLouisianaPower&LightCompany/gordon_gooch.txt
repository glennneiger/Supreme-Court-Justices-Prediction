mr.
gordon
gooch
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
two
basic
issues,
the
first
is
the
issue
of
whether
the
federal
power
commission
has
jurisdiction
to
protect
the
interstate
consumers
of
natural
gas
transported
in
interstate
commerce,
regardless
of
whether
the
ultimate
customer
of
that
gas
is
a
customer,
the
distribution
company
or
a
direct
purchaser
from
the
pipeline.
the
second
issue
is
whether
or
not
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir,
whether
the
federal
power
commission
has
jurisdiction
under
section
1
(b)
of
the
natural
gas
act,
and
sections
4,
5
and
16
to
regulate
the
curtailments
of
service
of
gas
transported
in
interstate
commerce
by
interstate
pipelines,
regardless
of
whether
the
customer
is
a
customer
of
a
distribution
company,
or
a
direct
purchaser
from
the
pipeline.
the
second
issue
is
whether
the
fifth
circuit
properly
found
that
the
federal
power
commission
did
not
have
jurisdiction
over
certain
facilities
when
the
federal
power
commission
subsequently
has
found
that
they
did
have
jurisdiction
over
those
facilities
due
to
the
injection
of
substantial
quantities
of
interstate
gas.
the
case
arose
when
louisiana
power
and
light
filed
suit
in
the
district
court
in
louisiana
seeking
to
enjoin
united
gas
pipe
line,
from
implementing
any
curtailment
program
which
would
result
in
the
reduction
of
gas
delivered
to
two
of
their
generating
plants.
at
the
time,
the
suit
was
instituted,
two
separate
proceedings
were
pending
before
the
federal
power
commission.
the
first
proceeding,
a
curtailment
proceeding
was
to
determine
the
federal
power
commission's
jurisdiction
to
allocate
the
suppliers
of
interstate
natural
gas
pipelines.
when
their
gas
supplies
were
so
depleted
that
they
were
unable
to
meet
the
contracts
of
all
of
their
consumers
in
all
states
served
by
the
pipeline,
directly
or
indirectly.
and
a
second
proceeding
was
pending
to
determine
the
jurisdictional
status
of
certain
facilities
that
are
part
of
the
united
gas
pipe
line
system,
that
and
part
of
the
time
in
the
past
had
been
operated
in
intrastate
commerce
with
a
separate
system
of
supply,
but
subsequently
quantities
of
interstate
gas
had
been
injected
into
the
former
intrastate
system.
and
the
question
presented
was
whether
or
not
those
facilities,
therefore
were
subject
to
federal
and
not
state
jurisdiction.
the
louisiana
power
and
light
company
obtained
a
temporary
restraining
order
ordering
united
to
make
their
full
deliveries
without
curtailment.
on
lp&l's
claim
that
domestic
customers
did
not
need
the
gas,
that
was
ordered
curtailed.
in
time
sequence
now,
and
i'll
skip
some
procedural
matters,
in
time
sequence,
the
federal
power
commission
then
held
in
the
curtailment
proceeding
that
under
section
1
(b)
of
the
natural
gas
act,
sections
4
and
5
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
transco
case
and
panhandle
in
332
u.s,
that
the
federal
power
commission
had
plenary
jurisdiction
under
its
transportation
authority,
over
gas
dedicated
to
interstate
commerce
and
being
transported
in
interstate
commerce,
and
had
the
power
to
curtail,
any
and
all
customers
of
a
pipeline
in
order
to
be
sure
that
a
fair
allocation
of
gas
supplies
would
be
available
to
all
interstate
consumers.
next,
in
time
sequence,
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
the
federal
power
commission
had
no
jurisdiction
to
order
curtailments
of
deliveries
of
gas
dedicated
to
interstate
commerce,
transported
in
interstate
commerce
but
delivered
to
direct
industrial
consumers
as
distinguished
from
deliveries
to
distribution
companies
for
ultimate
resale
to
public,
citizens,
and
industries.
subsequently
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
sir,
it
appeared
to
me
that
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
under
section
7
(b)
the
commission
could
have
an
abandonment
proceedings
and
order
the
direct
industrials
completely
out
of
an
interstate
pipeline.
the
fifth
circuit
said
between
the
initial
certification
under
section
7
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
no,
sir
they
didn't
really
approach
that,
they
only
said
that
to
the
extent
that
the
federal
power
commission
has
any
jurisdiction,
it's
under
section
7,
and
that
would
be
limited
to
the
initial
certification
or
the
abandonment,
but
nothing
in
between.
mr.
gordon
gooch
and
the
curtailment
proceedings
are
handled
under
section
4
and
5
and
16,
not
under
section
7.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
i
can't
say
that,
sir.
i
think
that
they
would
permit
an
abandonment
proceeding,
that
would
have
a
result
of
reducing
permanently
the
services
to
a
direct
industrial
customer.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
of
fifth
circuit
that
curtailments
could
be
handled,
that
is
to
say
abandonments
of
service
could
be
handled
under
section
7,
that
wasn't
an
issue.
the
issue
was
whether
or
not
it
could
be
handled
under
sections
4,
5,
and
16.
the
fifth
circuit
went
on
to
hold
that
the
federal
power
commission
could
not
exercise
jurisdiction
over
the
former
intrastate
facilities
because
in
the
fifth
circuit's
view
the
quantities
of
gas
injected
in
to
that
system
were
de
minimis,
and
there
was
a
possibility
that
another
affiliate
of
the
pipeline
could
have
put
the
same
quantities
of
gas
into
the
system
that
were
interstate
gas.
in
the
federal
power
commission's
opinion
subsequently
issued,
the
commission
found
that
the
gas
being
injected
into
the
system
was
substantial.
in
fact
made
67%
of
the
peak
day
deliveries
for
the
new
orleans'
system,
and
found
that
the
affiliate
of
the
united
gas
pipe
line
did
not
have
sufficient
quantities
or
deliverability
basis
to
make
up
the
difference
and
that
the
interstate
gas
was
needed
in
order
to
maintain
the
peak
day
viability
of
the
formally
intrastate
system.
now
both
commission
decisions,
both
deciding
its
authority
under
curtailments,
and
also
deciding
its
authority
over
the
green
system
as
it's
called
are
now
pending
before
the
fifth
circuit
for
decision.
the
commission
through
the
solicitor
general
requested
certiorari
because
if
the
fifth
circuit's
decision
is
correct,
and
the
federal
power
commission
has
no
jurisdiction
over
gas
transported
in
interstate
commerce,
except
as
an
initial
certifying
matter
or
except
at
the
conclusion
of
an
abandonment
proceedings
after
the
individual
customer
is
being
compelled
to
abandon.
then
the
federal
power
commission
is
powerless
to
prevent
the
interstate
consumers
of
natural
gas,
the
domestic
consumers,
the
homes,
the
schools,
or
hospitals
from
being
certain
that
they
have
a
chance
for
their
fair
share
of
a
scarce
gas
supply
when
the
pipelines
are
unable
to
meet
all
other
contracts.
now
lp&l
has
put
a
question
that
the
louisiana
commission
is
better
able
to
determine
the
public
interest
of
louisiana
citizens
for
the
use
of
gas
supply
than
the
federal
power
commission,
and
they
argued
that
the
elected
officials
of
the
state
of
louisiana
would
be
more
likely
to
protect
the
interest
of
louisiana
citizens
than
with
the
federal
power
commission,
we
don't
argue
that
point.
our
point
is
that
it
is
our
responsibility
as
we
read
the
natural
gas
act
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
under
it.
it
is
our
responsibility
to
protect
the
gas
supply
of
all
consumers
in
all
states
served
by
the
interstate
pipeline,
and
in
this
case,
gas
from
united
gets
us
far
away
as
boston,
because
they
resale
the
texas
gas,
texas
eastern,
transco,
southern
natural,
and
that
gas
then
is
transported
not
only
in
interstate
commerce
by
united
but
by
other
pipelines
throughout
the
eastern
portion
of
the
united
states.
and
if
the
federal
power
commission
has
no
authority
to
curtail
or
divert
the
volumes
that
are
dedicated
to
industrial
consumers
in
the
state
of
production
or
in
any
other
state,
then
the
commission
has
no
authority
either
to
prohibit
undue
preferences
or
discriminations
under
section
4,
which
is
a
clear
ground
of
authority
to
the
commission,
nor
any
action
under
section
5
or
16
of
the
gas
act.
now
section
1
(b)
of
the
natural
gas
act
from
which
our
authority
derives
states
clearly
that
we
have
three
alternate,
basis
independent
responsibility
jurisdiction.
the
first
is
jurisdiction
over
transportation
of
gas
in
interstate
commerce.
the
second
is
over
sales
for
resale
of
gas
in
interstate
commerce.
and
the
third
is
over
the
natural
gas
companies
themselves.
and
this
court
in
the
east
ohio
case
in
338
us
and
in
the
panhandle
case
332
us
has
clearly
set
out
those
as
independent
grounds
of
the
federal
power
commission's
jurisdiction.
and
in
two
cases,
the
panhandle
332
and
in
transco
365,
this
court
has
specifically
recognized
that
when
curtailments
are
necessary,
that
curtailments
and
interruption
of
service
are
matter
that
relates
to
transportation
and
therefore
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
power
commission
to
control,
and
allocating
the
competing
demands
among
the
several
states.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes
sir.
in
the
transco
case,
in
recognition,
the
court
recognized
the
types
of
authority
that
the
federal
power
commission
had
--
both
the
panhandle
case
and
and
the
transco
were
not
curtailment
cases,
that
is
to
say
where
the
issue
is
presented,
but
in
both
of
those
cases,
the
court
recognized
that
in
a
matter
of
allocating
gas
supply
among
the
several
states,
that
it
was
the
type
of
authority
that
was
granted
to
this
commission
and
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
--
they
would
have
to
--
assuming
the
contract
[voice
overlap]
mr.
gordon
gooch
no
contract
at
all.
mr.
gordon
gooch
no
sir,
they
could
do
not
do
that.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
the
federal
power
commission
has
ordered
all
pipelines
that
are
unable
to
meet
all
their
contracts,
direct
or
indirect
filed
under
section
4.
mr.
gordon
gooch
well
sir,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
federal
power
commission
has
three
choices.
the
federal
power
commission
may
proceed
under
section
4
and
5
as
one
choice.
the
federal
power
commission
may
proceed
under
section
7
and
order
abandonment
if
it
so
chooses.
mr.
gordon
gooch
or
forbid
it,
well
it's
not
necessary
--
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
and
the
third
is
under
section
16
or
otherwise
as
we
had
a
rule
making,
405
which
considered
the
possibility
of
adopting
regulations
nationwide
that
would
handle
this
problem
so
that
it
wouldn't
run
the
risk
of
householders
having
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
somebody
is
going
to
be
curtailed.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes
sir,
but
the
fifth
circuit
has
held
that
the
direct
customers
do
not
come
to
the
commission,
they
are
free
to
sue
for
their
full
contract
quantities
in
court
and
then
it's
up
to
the
court
to
determine
who
had
to
allocate
the
gas
and
decide
who
gets
the
gas.
mr.
gordon
gooch
well
sir,
the
problem
with
that
is
there
are
some
300
and
some
odd
contracts
on
united
system
that
all
the
contract
provisions
are
not
the
same.
and
the
extent
to
which
you
relied
on
contract
rather
than
regulation
to
decide
who
gets
interrupted.
you
then
have
two
problems,
one
a
court
assuming
a
state
court
is
handling
and
has
the
jurisdiction
to
affect
gas
in
other
states,
that
is
to
say
divert
it
from
an
interstate
stream
to
serve
a
local
need.
he
has
got
to
determine
if
it
has
a
domestic
preference
in
it.
he
is
got
to
determine
what
all
the
domestic
needs
on
the
entire
interstate
system
is,
before
he
can
do
it
and
that's
what
the
commission
does.
the
court
would
have
to
do
it
too.
secondly,
in
this
very
case
on
lp&l's
sworn
allegation,
the
district
court
entered
a
temporary
restraining
order,
saying
that
the
domestic
customers
did
not
need
the
gas
and
therefore
lp&l
could
not
be
interrupted.
so
we
run
the
risk
of
multiple
litigation
on
contract
by
contract
basis,
with
no
one
unless
every
distribution
company
and
every
customer
participates.
mr.
gordon
gooch
that's
a
possibility
sir.
basically
what
the
commission
is
doing
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
i
think
so,
i
am
not
sure
i
understood
your
question
but
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
oh
yes
sir,
no
question
about
that.
and
the
other
proposition
is
the
federal
power
commission
is
claiming
the
right
to
overwrite
the
contracts,
no
matter
what
they
say.
so
that
a
rational
system
of
interstate
priorities
can
be
setup,
so
that
the
interstate
customers
will
not
have
their
gas
diverted
at
the
basis
of
a
state
regulatory
commission,
or
state,
or
other
court
and
instead
there
will
be
an
interstate,
regulation
of
an
interstate
gas
trade.
mr.
gordon
gooch
no
sir,
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
--
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
in
the
fifth
circuit's
decision
that
the
commission
could
proceed
by
way
of
abandonment
and
knock
a
direct
industry
or
any
other
customer
of
an
interstate
pipeline,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
we
didn't
claim
that
sir,
we
weren't
claiming
that
we
had
a
modification
of
the
certificate,
what
we
were
saying
was
that
under
section
4
and
5
of
the
natural
gas
act,
that
says
that
the
commission
has
certain
powers
among
of
which
is
to
prevent
discrimination
against
any
person,
that
we
have
the
power
to
overwrite
the
contracts
that
were
behind
those
certificates.
mr.
gordon
gooch
no
sir,
we
could
not
because
until
the
end
of
a
lengthy
proceeding,
i
don't
know
who
would
determine
where
the
interstate
gas
supply
would
go,
that
would
depend
on
who
got
to
the
courthouse
first,
or
who
was
closer
to
the
interstate
source
and
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
not
only
individual
contract
but
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes
sir,
it
does
because
the
federal
power
commission
has
no
jurisdiction
whatsoever
to
order
interstate
pipelines
to
exchange
gas
among
themselves.
nor
can
we
order
gas
from
the
intrastate
market
into
the
interstate
market,
nor
can
we
order
a
producer
to
sell
gas
to
the
intrastate
market.
may
i
have
the
remaining
time
for
mr.
harvin
please?
mr.
gordon
gooch
thank
you,
mr
chief
justice.
it
seems
to
me
most
clear
from
looking
at
the
legislative
history
of
section
1
(b)
of
the
act.
when
you
look
at
the
committee
report
itself,
it
says
that
the
language
but
shall
not
apply
to
any
say
other
transportation
or
sale.
legislative
history
says
that
the
coded
words
were
not
actually
necessary
and
were
put
in
to
replace
the
language
that
had
previously
been
in
the
prior
draft
of
the
bill
which
was
h.
r.
4008.
mr.
gordon
gooch
no,
sir,
because
if
we
are
going
to
lose
on
that
ground,
we
are
going
to
lose
because
it's
not
in
the
transportation
jurisdiction
because
i
don't
think
those
language
would
be
--
based
on
the
legislative
history
and
the
reading
of
the
statute,
i
don't
think
the
'but
for'
language
makes
any
difference.
in
other
words,
as
the
legislative
history
said
the
'but
for'
language
is
not
necessary.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
i
agree,
sir.
now,
the
legislative
history
of
4008
specifically
had,
4008
had
a
clause
in
it
that
said
that
this
shall
not
apply
to
rates,
charged
to
direct
industrial
usage,
or
any
other
rates,
and
when
you
look
at
the
hearings,
the
whole
issue
was
rate
jurisdiction,
and
this
commission
was
not
given
rate
jurisdiction
over
retail
rates
regardless
of
who
made
the
retail
rates,
whether
it's
distribution
coming
or
direct,
and
we
don't
claim
jurisdiction
over
rates.
this
court
in
the
transco,
365
u.s.
1,
approximately
at
page
27
recognized
that,
that
proviso
was
to
take
rate
jurisdiction
out,
and
these
references
to
chairman
swidler's
testimony
was
when
he
was
trying
to
get
for
the
federal
power
commission
jurisdiction
over
the
rates
at
which
direct
industrial
sales
were
made
because
in
a
rate
case
of
the
federal
power
commission
now,
we
first
allocate
the
cost
of
the
direct
industrial
sales
and
throw
them
out.
and
we
don't
consider
them
no
further
and
we
therefore
set
rates
only
to
the
sales
for
resale.
we
exercised
no
rate
jurisdiction
over
the
direct
industrial
sale.
and
the
cases
on
panhandle,
this
is
the
first
i
have
heard
that
panhandle
dealt
allocations
of
new
service
because
mr.
justice
rutledge
said,
appellant
also
envisions
in
conflicting
regulations
by
the
commissions
of
the
various
states
in
its
main
pipeline
serves
particularly
in
relation
to
curtailment
of
service
when
weather
conditions
or
others
required.
i
don't
believe
mr
justice
rutledge
can
fairly
be
talking
about
initial
licensing,
when
he
is
talking
about
curtailment
in
this
matter.
the
commission
did
report
in
its
annual
report
in
1970
that
it
thought
that
it
should
have
jurisdiction
that
compelled
the
interconnection
regardless
of
whether
it
had
jurisdiction
over
the
pipeline,
different
types
of
customers
because
various
distribution
companies
are
occasionally
served
by
more
than
one
pipeline.
some
distribution
companies
now
have
their
own
imports.
some
distribution
companies
have
their
own
supplies
of
natural
gas
and
that
would
supplement
and
augment
our
curtailment
jurisdiction.
mr.
justice
white,
7
(b)
does
require.
united
may
not
abandon
a
direct
sale
until
it
comes
in
and
gets
permission
from
the
federal
power
commission.
the
mere
fact
that
the
contract
has
expired
does
not
permit
an
interstate
pipeline
from
terminating
any
service.
7
(b)
prohibits
the
termination
of
any
service
until
the
commission
has
authorized
it
to
do
so.
it's
not
a
question
of
terminating
the
sale,
it's
the
service.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes.
mr.
gordon
gooch
it
asked
for
a
declaratory
order.
mr.
gordon
gooch
under
our
regular
rules
of
practice
and
procedures
for
asking
a
declaratory
order.
mr.
gordon
gooch
well,
you
see
united
already
had
a
curtailment
plan
as
part
of
their
tariff
and
they
did
not
have
to
file
a
new
curtailment
plan
at
that
time
and
they
asked
the
commission,
if
they
were
faithfully
following
the
curtailment
plan
that
commission
wanted
to
follow,
and
so
that
would
be
under
--
in
my
view
under
both
section
4
and
5.
and
the
commission
set
it
down
for
hearing.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
it
is.
they
had
a
general
tariff
on
file
for
curtailment.
and
they
asked
whether
or
not
that
should
be
applied
also
to
the
direct
investors.
mr.
gordon
gooch
over
several
years
sir.
i
don't
recall,
6
or
7
years
or
perhaps
even
longer.
and
then
when
the
commission
found
that
seven
pipelines
are
having
to
go
to
curtailment,
fourteen
pipelines
had
to
buy
emergency
supplies
of
gas.
when
the
commission
could
anticipate
that,
that
was
happening
and
the
interstate
pipeline
were
unable
to
meet,
the
commission
ordered
under
order
431,
they
ordered
all
pipelines
to
file
new
curtailment
plans
and
the
commission
now
has
some
26
of
these
pending
in
order
to
make
a
fair
allocation
of
the
interstate
supplies
of
gas
among
the
interstate
pipelines
not
the
intrastate
pipelines.
with
regard
to
the
green
system,
the
federal
power
commission
intervened
but
all
we
could
say
to
the
court
when
we
intervened
is,
we
have
a
proceeding
pending
in
which
we
are
taking
evidence
to
determine
what
the
jurisdictional
status
of
this
case
is,
and
all
of
our
evidence
was
this
is
what's
pending
before
the
federal
power
commission
until
the
federal
power
commission
completed
the
hearing,
got
the
evidence,
analyzed
it,
and
took
a
position.
we
who
intervened
on
behalf
of
the
commission
were
unable
to
say
whether
the
system
was
jurisdictional
or
not,
and
their
findings
of
the
the
commission
after
review
of
the
whole
record
was,
that
if
the
interstate
supply
of
gas
was
shut
off
from
that
system,
on
a
cold
day
67%
of
the
gas
used
in
the
new
orleans
area
would
also
be
shut
off.
mr.
gordon
gooch
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
two
basic
issues,
the
first
is
the
issue
of
whether
the
federal
power
commission
has
jurisdiction
to
protect
the
interstate
consumers
of
natural
gas
transported
in
interstate
commerce,
regardless
of
whether
the
ultimate
customer
of
that
gas
is
a
customer,
the
distribution
company
or
a
direct
purchaser
from
the
pipeline.
the
second
issue
is
whether
or
not
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir,
whether
the
federal
power
commission
has
jurisdiction
under
section
1
(b)
of
the
natural
gas
act,
and
sections
4,
5
and
16
to
regulate
the
curtailments
of
service
of
gas
transported
in
interstate
commerce
by
interstate
pipelines,
regardless
of
whether
the
customer
is
a
customer
of
a
distribution
company,
or
a
direct
purchaser
from
the
pipeline.
the
second
issue
is
whether
the
fifth
circuit
properly
found
that
the
federal
power
commission
did
not
have
jurisdiction
over
certain
facilities
when
the
federal
power
commission
subsequently
has
found
that
they
did
have
jurisdiction
over
those
facilities
due
to
the
injection
of
substantial
quantities
of
interstate
gas.
the
case
arose
when
louisiana
power
and
light
filed
suit
in
the
district
court
in
louisiana
seeking
to
enjoin
united
gas
pipe
line,
from
implementing
any
curtailment
program
which
would
result
in
the
reduction
of
gas
delivered
to
two
of
their
generating
plants.
at
the
time,
the
suit
was
instituted,
two
separate
proceedings
were
pending
before
the
federal
power
commission.
the
first
proceeding,
a
curtailment
proceeding
was
to
determine
the
federal
power
commission's
jurisdiction
to
allocate
the
suppliers
of
interstate
natural
gas
pipelines.
when
their
gas
supplies
were
so
depleted
that
they
were
unable
to
meet
the
contracts
of
all
of
their
consumers
in
all
states
served
by
the
pipeline,
directly
or
indirectly.
and
a
second
proceeding
was
pending
to
determine
the
jurisdictional
status
of
certain
facilities
that
are
part
of
the
united
gas
pipe
line
system,
that
and
part
of
the
time
in
the
past
had
been
operated
in
intrastate
commerce
with
a
separate
system
of
supply,
but
subsequently
quantities
of
interstate
gas
had
been
injected
into
the
former
intrastate
system.
and
the
question
presented
was
whether
or
not
those
facilities,
therefore
were
subject
to
federal
and
not
state
jurisdiction.
the
louisiana
power
and
light
company
obtained
a
temporary
restraining
order
ordering
united
to
make
their
full
deliveries
without
curtailment.
on
lp&l's
claim
that
domestic
customers
did
not
need
the
gas,
that
was
ordered
curtailed.
in
time
sequence
now,
and
i'll
skip
some
procedural
matters,
in
time
sequence,
the
federal
power
commission
then
held
in
the
curtailment
proceeding
that
under
section
1
(b)
of
the
natural
gas
act,
sections
4
and
5
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
transco
case
and
panhandle
in
332
u.s,
that
the
federal
power
commission
had
plenary
jurisdiction
under
its
transportation
authority,
over
gas
dedicated
to
interstate
commerce
and
being
transported
in
interstate
commerce,
and
had
the
power
to
curtail,
any
and
all
customers
of
a
pipeline
in
order
to
be
sure
that
a
fair
allocation
of
gas
supplies
would
be
available
to
all
interstate
consumers.
next,
in
time
sequence,
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
the
federal
power
commission
had
no
jurisdiction
to
order
curtailments
of
deliveries
of
gas
dedicated
to
interstate
commerce,
transported
in
interstate
commerce
but
delivered
to
direct
industrial
consumers
as
distinguished
from
deliveries
to
distribution
companies
for
ultimate
resale
to
public,
citizens,
and
industries.
subsequently
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
sir,
it
appeared
to
me
that
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
under
section
7
(b)
the
commission
could
have
an
abandonment
proceedings
and
order
the
direct
industrials
completely
out
of
an
interstate
pipeline.
the
fifth
circuit
said
between
the
initial
certification
under
section
7
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
no,
sir
they
didn't
really
approach
that,
they
only
said
that
to
the
extent
that
the
federal
power
commission
has
any
jurisdiction,
it's
under
section
7,
and
that
would
be
limited
to
the
initial
certification
or
the
abandonment,
but
nothing
in
between.
mr.
gordon
gooch
and
the
curtailment
proceedings
are
handled
under
section
4
and
5
and
16,
not
under
section
7.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
i
can't
say
that,
sir.
i
think
that
they
would
permit
an
abandonment
proceeding,
that
would
have
a
result
of
reducing
permanently
the
services
to
a
direct
industrial
customer.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
of
fifth
circuit
that
curtailments
could
be
handled,
that
is
to
say
abandonments
of
service
could
be
handled
under
section
7,
that
wasn't
an
issue.
the
issue
was
whether
or
not
it
could
be
handled
under
sections
4,
5,
and
16.
the
fifth
circuit
went
on
to
hold
that
the
federal
power
commission
could
not
exercise
jurisdiction
over
the
former
intrastate
facilities
because
in
the
fifth
circuit's
view
the
quantities
of
gas
injected
in
to
that
system
were
de
minimis,
and
there
was
a
possibility
that
another
affiliate
of
the
pipeline
could
have
put
the
same
quantities
of
gas
into
the
system
that
were
interstate
gas.
in
the
federal
power
commission's
opinion
subsequently
issued,
the
commission
found
that
the
gas
being
injected
into
the
system
was
substantial.
in
fact
made
67%
of
the
peak
day
deliveries
for
the
new
orleans'
system,
and
found
that
the
affiliate
of
the
united
gas
pipe
line
did
not
have
sufficient
quantities
or
deliverability
basis
to
make
up
the
difference
and
that
the
interstate
gas
was
needed
in
order
to
maintain
the
peak
day
viability
of
the
formally
intrastate
system.
now
both
commission
decisions,
both
deciding
its
authority
under
curtailments,
and
also
deciding
its
authority
over
the
green
system
as
it's
called
are
now
pending
before
the
fifth
circuit
for
decision.
the
commission
through
the
solicitor
general
requested
certiorari
because
if
the
fifth
circuit's
decision
is
correct,
and
the
federal
power
commission
has
no
jurisdiction
over
gas
transported
in
interstate
commerce,
except
as
an
initial
certifying
matter
or
except
at
the
conclusion
of
an
abandonment
proceedings
after
the
individual
customer
is
being
compelled
to
abandon.
then
the
federal
power
commission
is
powerless
to
prevent
the
interstate
consumers
of
natural
gas,
the
domestic
consumers,
the
homes,
the
schools,
or
hospitals
from
being
certain
that
they
have
a
chance
for
their
fair
share
of
a
scarce
gas
supply
when
the
pipelines
are
unable
to
meet
all
other
contracts.
now
lp&l
has
put
a
question
that
the
louisiana
commission
is
better
able
to
determine
the
public
interest
of
louisiana
citizens
for
the
use
of
gas
supply
than
the
federal
power
commission,
and
they
argued
that
the
elected
officials
of
the
state
of
louisiana
would
be
more
likely
to
protect
the
interest
of
louisiana
citizens
than
with
the
federal
power
commission,
we
don't
argue
that
point.
our
point
is
that
it
is
our
responsibility
as
we
read
the
natural
gas
act
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
under
it.
it
is
our
responsibility
to
protect
the
gas
supply
of
all
consumers
in
all
states
served
by
the
interstate
pipeline,
and
in
this
case,
gas
from
united
gets
us
far
away
as
boston,
because
they
resale
the
texas
gas,
texas
eastern,
transco,
southern
natural,
and
that
gas
then
is
transported
not
only
in
interstate
commerce
by
united
but
by
other
pipelines
throughout
the
eastern
portion
of
the
united
states.
and
if
the
federal
power
commission
has
no
authority
to
curtail
or
divert
the
volumes
that
are
dedicated
to
industrial
consumers
in
the
state
of
production
or
in
any
other
state,
then
the
commission
has
no
authority
either
to
prohibit
undue
preferences
or
discriminations
under
section
4,
which
is
a
clear
ground
of
authority
to
the
commission,
nor
any
action
under
section
5
or
16
of
the
gas
act.
now
section
1
(b)
of
the
natural
gas
act
from
which
our
authority
derives
states
clearly
that
we
have
three
alternate,
basis
independent
responsibility
jurisdiction.
the
first
is
jurisdiction
over
transportation
of
gas
in
interstate
commerce.
the
second
is
over
sales
for
resale
of
gas
in
interstate
commerce.
and
the
third
is
over
the
natural
gas
companies
themselves.
and
this
court
in
the
east
ohio
case
in
338
us
and
in
the
panhandle
case
332
us
has
clearly
set
out
those
as
independent
grounds
of
the
federal
power
commission's
jurisdiction.
and
in
two
cases,
the
panhandle
332
and
in
transco
365,
this
court
has
specifically
recognized
that
when
curtailments
are
necessary,
that
curtailments
and
interruption
of
service
are
matter
that
relates
to
transportation
and
therefore
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
power
commission
to
control,
and
allocating
the
competing
demands
among
the
several
states.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes
sir.
in
the
transco
case,
in
recognition,
the
court
recognized
the
types
of
authority
that
the
federal
power
commission
had
--
both
the
panhandle
case
and
and
the
transco
were
not
curtailment
cases,
that
is
to
say
where
the
issue
is
presented,
but
in
both
of
those
cases,
the
court
recognized
that
in
a
matter
of
allocating
gas
supply
among
the
several
states,
that
it
was
the
type
of
authority
that
was
granted
to
this
commission
and
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
--
they
would
have
to
--
assuming
the
contract
[voice
overlap]
mr.
gordon
gooch
no
contract
at
all.
mr.
gordon
gooch
no
sir,
they
could
do
not
do
that.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
the
federal
power
commission
has
ordered
all
pipelines
that
are
unable
to
meet
all
their
contracts,
direct
or
indirect
filed
under
section
4.
mr.
gordon
gooch
well
sir,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
federal
power
commission
has
three
choices.
the
federal
power
commission
may
proceed
under
section
4
and
5
as
one
choice.
the
federal
power
commission
may
proceed
under
section
7
and
order
abandonment
if
it
so
chooses.
mr.
gordon
gooch
or
forbid
it,
well
it's
not
necessary
--
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
and
the
third
is
under
section
16
or
otherwise
as
we
had
a
rule
making,
405
which
considered
the
possibility
of
adopting
regulations
nationwide
that
would
handle
this
problem
so
that
it
wouldn't
run
the
risk
of
householders
having
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
somebody
is
going
to
be
curtailed.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes
sir,
but
the
fifth
circuit
has
held
that
the
direct
customers
do
not
come
to
the
commission,
they
are
free
to
sue
for
their
full
contract
quantities
in
court
and
then
it's
up
to
the
court
to
determine
who
had
to
allocate
the
gas
and
decide
who
gets
the
gas.
mr.
gordon
gooch
well
sir,
the
problem
with
that
is
there
are
some
300
and
some
odd
contracts
on
united
system
that
all
the
contract
provisions
are
not
the
same.
and
the
extent
to
which
you
relied
on
contract
rather
than
regulation
to
decide
who
gets
interrupted.
you
then
have
two
problems,
one
a
court
assuming
a
state
court
is
handling
and
has
the
jurisdiction
to
affect
gas
in
other
states,
that
is
to
say
divert
it
from
an
interstate
stream
to
serve
a
local
need.
he
has
got
to
determine
if
it
has
a
domestic
preference
in
it.
he
is
got
to
determine
what
all
the
domestic
needs
on
the
entire
interstate
system
is,
before
he
can
do
it
and
that's
what
the
commission
does.
the
court
would
have
to
do
it
too.
secondly,
in
this
very
case
on
lp&l's
sworn
allegation,
the
district
court
entered
a
temporary
restraining
order,
saying
that
the
domestic
customers
did
not
need
the
gas
and
therefore
lp&l
could
not
be
interrupted.
so
we
run
the
risk
of
multiple
litigation
on
contract
by
contract
basis,
with
no
one
unless
every
distribution
company
and
every
customer
participates.
mr.
gordon
gooch
that's
a
possibility
sir.
basically
what
the
commission
is
doing
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
i
think
so,
i
am
not
sure
i
understood
your
question
but
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
oh
yes
sir,
no
question
about
that.
and
the
other
proposition
is
the
federal
power
commission
is
claiming
the
right
to
overwrite
the
contracts,
no
matter
what
they
say.
so
that
a
rational
system
of
interstate
priorities
can
be
setup,
so
that
the
interstate
customers
will
not
have
their
gas
diverted
at
the
basis
of
a
state
regulatory
commission,
or
state,
or
other
court
and
instead
there
will
be
an
interstate,
regulation
of
an
interstate
gas
trade.
mr.
gordon
gooch
no
sir,
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
--
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
in
the
fifth
circuit's
decision
that
the
commission
could
proceed
by
way
of
abandonment
and
knock
a
direct
industry
or
any
other
customer
of
an
interstate
pipeline,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
we
didn't
claim
that
sir,
we
weren't
claiming
that
we
had
a
modification
of
the
certificate,
what
we
were
saying
was
that
under
section
4
and
5
of
the
natural
gas
act,
that
says
that
the
commission
has
certain
powers
among
of
which
is
to
prevent
discrimination
against
any
person,
that
we
have
the
power
to
overwrite
the
contracts
that
were
behind
those
certificates.
mr.
gordon
gooch
no
sir,
we
could
not
because
until
the
end
of
a
lengthy
proceeding,
i
don't
know
who
would
determine
where
the
interstate
gas
supply
would
go,
that
would
depend
on
who
got
to
the
courthouse
first,
or
who
was
closer
to
the
interstate
source
and
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
not
only
individual
contract
but
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes
sir,
it
does
because
the
federal
power
commission
has
no
jurisdiction
whatsoever
to
order
interstate
pipelines
to
exchange
gas
among
themselves.
nor
can
we
order
gas
from
the
intrastate
market
into
the
interstate
market,
nor
can
we
order
a
producer
to
sell
gas
to
the
intrastate
market.
may
i
have
the
remaining
time
for
mr.
harvin
please?
mr.
gordon
gooch
thank
you,
mr
chief
justice.
it
seems
to
me
most
clear
from
looking
at
the
legislative
history
of
section
1
(b)
of
the
act.
when
you
look
at
the
committee
report
itself,
it
says
that
the
language
but
shall
not
apply
to
any
say
other
transportation
or
sale.
legislative
history
says
that
the
coded
words
were
not
actually
necessary
and
were
put
in
to
replace
the
language
that
had
previously
been
in
the
prior
draft
of
the
bill
which
was
h.
r.
4008.
mr.
gordon
gooch
no,
sir,
because
if
we
are
going
to
lose
on
that
ground,
we
are
going
to
lose
because
it's
not
in
the
transportation
jurisdiction
because
i
don't
think
those
language
would
be
--
based
on
the
legislative
history
and
the
reading
of
the
statute,
i
don't
think
the
'but
for'
language
makes
any
difference.
in
other
words,
as
the
legislative
history
said
the
'but
for'
language
is
not
necessary.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
i
agree,
sir.
now,
the
legislative
history
of
4008
specifically
had,
4008
had
a
clause
in
it
that
said
that
this
shall
not
apply
to
rates,
charged
to
direct
industrial
usage,
or
any
other
rates,
and
when
you
look
at
the
hearings,
the
whole
issue
was
rate
jurisdiction,
and
this
commission
was
not
given
rate
jurisdiction
over
retail
rates
regardless
of
who
made
the
retail
rates,
whether
it's
distribution
coming
or
direct,
and
we
don't
claim
jurisdiction
over
rates.
this
court
in
the
transco,
365
u.s.
1,
approximately
at
page
27
recognized
that,
that
proviso
was
to
take
rate
jurisdiction
out,
and
these
references
to
chairman
swidler's
testimony
was
when
he
was
trying
to
get
for
the
federal
power
commission
jurisdiction
over
the
rates
at
which
direct
industrial
sales
were
made
because
in
a
rate
case
of
the
federal
power
commission
now,
we
first
allocate
the
cost
of
the
direct
industrial
sales
and
throw
them
out.
and
we
don't
consider
them
no
further
and
we
therefore
set
rates
only
to
the
sales
for
resale.
we
exercised
no
rate
jurisdiction
over
the
direct
industrial
sale.
and
the
cases
on
panhandle,
this
is
the
first
i
have
heard
that
panhandle
dealt
allocations
of
new
service
because
mr.
justice
rutledge
said,
appellant
also
envisions
in
conflicting
regulations
by
the
commissions
of
the
various
states
in
its
main
pipeline
serves
particularly
in
relation
to
curtailment
of
service
when
weather
conditions
or
others
required.
i
don't
believe
mr
justice
rutledge
can
fairly
be
talking
about
initial
licensing,
when
he
is
talking
about
curtailment
in
this
matter.
the
commission
did
report
in
its
annual
report
in
1970
that
it
thought
that
it
should
have
jurisdiction
that
compelled
the
interconnection
regardless
of
whether
it
had
jurisdiction
over
the
pipeline,
different
types
of
customers
because
various
distribution
companies
are
occasionally
served
by
more
than
one
pipeline.
some
distribution
companies
now
have
their
own
imports.
some
distribution
companies
have
their
own
supplies
of
natural
gas
and
that
would
supplement
and
augment
our
curtailment
jurisdiction.
mr.
justice
white,
7
(b)
does
require.
united
may
not
abandon
a
direct
sale
until
it
comes
in
and
gets
permission
from
the
federal
power
commission.
the
mere
fact
that
the
contract
has
expired
does
not
permit
an
interstate
pipeline
from
terminating
any
service.
7
(b)
prohibits
the
termination
of
any
service
until
the
commission
has
authorized
it
to
do
so.
it's
not
a
question
of
terminating
the
sale,
it's
the
service.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes.
mr.
gordon
gooch
it
asked
for
a
declaratory
order.
mr.
gordon
gooch
under
our
regular
rules
of
practice
and
procedures
for
asking
a
declaratory
order.
mr.
gordon
gooch
well,
you
see
united
already
had
a
curtailment
plan
as
part
of
their
tariff
and
they
did
not
have
to
file
a
new
curtailment
plan
at
that
time
and
they
asked
the
commission,
if
they
were
faithfully
following
the
curtailment
plan
that
commission
wanted
to
follow,
and
so
that
would
be
under
--
in
my
view
under
both
section
4
and
5.
and
the
commission
set
it
down
for
hearing.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
it
is.
they
had
a
general
tariff
on
file
for
curtailment.
and
they
asked
whether
or
not
that
should
be
applied
also
to
the
direct
investors.
mr.
gordon
gooch
over
several
years
sir.
i
don't
recall,
6
or
7
years
or
perhaps
even
longer.
and
then
when
the
commission
found
that
seven
pipelines
are
having
to
go
to
curtailment,
fourteen
pipelines
had
to
buy
emergency
supplies
of
gas.
when
the
commission
could
anticipate
that,
that
was
happening
and
the
interstate
pipeline
were
unable
to
meet,
the
commission
ordered
under
order
431,
they
ordered
all
pipelines
to
file
new
curtailment
plans
and
the
commission
now
has
some
26
of
these
pending
in
order
to
make
a
fair
allocation
of
the
interstate
supplies
of
gas
among
the
interstate
pipelines
not
the
intrastate
pipelines.
with
regard
to
the
green
system,
the
federal
power
commission
intervened
but
all
we
could
say
to
the
court
when
we
intervened
is,
we
have
a
proceeding
pending
in
which
we
are
taking
evidence
to
determine
what
the
jurisdictional
status
of
this
case
is,
and
all
of
our
evidence
was
this
is
what's
pending
before
the
federal
power
commission
until
the
federal
power
commission
completed
the
hearing,
got
the
evidence,
analyzed
it,
and
took
a
position.
we
who
intervened
on
behalf
of
the
commission
were
unable
to
say
whether
the
system
was
jurisdictional
or
not,
and
their
findings
of
the
the
commission
after
review
of
the
whole
record
was,
that
if
the
interstate
supply
of
gas
was
shut
off
from
that
system,
on
a
cold
day
67%
of
the
gas
used
in
the
new
orleans
area
would
also
be
shut
off.
