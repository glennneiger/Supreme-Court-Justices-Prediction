justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
carter.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
turning
to
1(b)
is
there
a
specific
exclusion
there,
that
you
are
relying
on.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
carter,
turning
back
to
1(b)
and
in
some
of
this
authority
that
it
grants
in
the
first
part
of
the
statute,
do
you
conceive
the
reservations
in
the
latter
part
of
the
section,
to
take
away
parts
that
were
granted
in
the
first
section
or
are
they
simply
a
statement
of
the
adverse
side,
simply
pointing
out
what
wasn't
granted?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
you
say
then,
that
were
it
not
for
the
provisos,
the
granting
would
give
broader
power
if
it
stood
by
itself?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah,
assume
that
the
granting
provisions
stood
by
themselves
and
what
you
refer
to
as
the
conservatory
provisions
were
absent.
i
take
it
then
you
would
feel
that
there
were
more
authority
conferred
in
that
situation
in
the
way
this
section
is
written
down.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gooch,
would
you
conceive
that
if
your
opponents
could
bring
these
curtailment
matters
within
the
definition
of
anything
that
they
referred
to
as
the
conservatory
portions
of
(b)
that
you
would
lose?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay,
but
then
if
it
doesn't
make
any
difference,
if
it's
within
the
transportation
jurisdiction,
it
shouldn't
come
within
any
of
them.
conversely,
if
it
is
within
one
of
them,
it
doesn't
come
within
the
transportation
issues.
