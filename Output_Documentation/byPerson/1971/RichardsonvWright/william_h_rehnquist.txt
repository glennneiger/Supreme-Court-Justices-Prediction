justice
william

rehnquist
mr.
sayler,
i
noticed
in
the
government’s
brief,
they
relied
rather
heavily
on
cafeteria
workers
versus
mcelroy
and
you
and
your
reply
to
them
treated
that
case
in
a
footnote
as
if
it
were
virtually
limited
to
its
fact,
at
least
that
is
one
impression
one
could
get
from
your
treatment
of
it.
do
you
disagree
with
the
general
statements
of
the
court
in
mcelroy
that
due
process
is
a
flexible
concept
and
you
have
to
analyze
it
precisely
what
it
is
that
you
are
affecting
before
you
decide
what
procedures
will
be
accorded?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
do
not
have
the
right
to
insist
to
the
insurance
company
to
grant
you
a
hearing.
if
you
do
not
like
what
the
insurance
company
does,
you
go
to
court?
