justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
excuse
me
mr.
gray,
may
i
ask,
do
i
understand
that
the
secretary
has
now
adopted
the
procedures
and
required
states
to
adopt
procedures
which
rather
provide
most
of
the
requirements
of
goldberg?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
am
not
going
as
far
as
were
they
applicable
to
goldberg?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
how
do
i
compare
with
the
requirements
in
goldberg
on
termination
of
welfare?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
would
it
--
in
what
respect
would
they
go
for?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
meanwhile,
continuing
the
payment
of
benefits?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
did
not
mean
to
interrupt
you,
would
you
complete?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
that
is
a
notice
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
an
opportunity
to
protest?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
what
form?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
--
but
no
hearing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
written
submissions
of
course
are
considered
by
whom?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
therefore,
i
gather,
unlike
what
is
required
before
termination
of
welfare,
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing
before
is
not
an
impartial
at
least
more
or
less
independent
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
under
the
operation
here.
here
i
guess
he
gets
a
notice
and
a
chance
to
protest
in
writing
and
that
is
the
end
of
it,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
do
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
in
any
effect
his
case
is
decided
on
the
basis
of
what
he
submits
in
writing
without
a
hearing,
would
that
be
your
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yeah.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
he
does
not
get
(voice
overlap).
he
got
--
he
gets
to
know
--
he
gets
(inaudible)
in
the
other
hearing,
the
challenge,
any
of
the
other
materials
that
have
been
collected
by
the
agency?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
should
be.
in
neither
of
these
cases
where
the
provisions
of
the
new
regulation
provided
even
though
there
were
no
regulation
that
is
neither
of
these
got
the
kind
of
notice
with
the
opportunity
to
file
written
protest.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
–
well,
i
do
not
--
what
if
they
had
been
at
the
time
this
case
was
brought,
but
i
gather
under
the
new
procedures
until
the
so
called
paper
hearing
proceeding
has
been
completed,
the
recipient
will
continue
to
get
this
disability
benefits?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
they
determine
it
and
then
the
post
termination
proceeding
is,
i
think
how
long,
six
months
or
more?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
in
that
interval
(voice
overlap),
the
initial
termination
or
suspension,
whatever
label
is
put
upon
it,
he
gets
no
disability
to
wholly
benefit
unless
they
are
reinstated
at
the
post
termination
hearing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
gather
your
position
is
nothing
sort
of
the
goldberg
procedures
which
satisfy
the
constitution,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
anything
more
than
what
is
required
in
this
situation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
