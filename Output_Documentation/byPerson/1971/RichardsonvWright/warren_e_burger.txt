chief

warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
70-161,
richardson
against
wright
and
5211,
wright
against
richardson.
mr.
gray
i
think
you
may
proceed
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
want
to
be
sure
that
i
have
it
clear,
they
would
get
more
now
than
they
did
not
get
at
the
time
they
were
processed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
the
secretary’s
regulation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
independent
of
the
district
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
computer
just
triggers
the
further
inquiries,
i
think?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
gray.
mr.
sayler?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
they
then
get
back
payments
retroactively?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
the
balancing
factor
that
would
fit
under
what
you
just
referred
to
in
relation
to
cafeteria
workers
case,
would
be
the
amounts
that
are
paid
out
in
disability
payments
to
people
for
periods
after
they
have
become
ineligible.
does
the
record
show
anything
about
the
dollar
amounts
or
either
estimates
or
accurate
figures
on
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
your
estimate
a
million
dollars
for
the
whole
united
states,
for
the
personnel
necessary,
the
expense
necessary
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i
was
thinking
that
geographical
areas,
is
that
for
the
district
of
columbia
or
the
whole
united
states?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
suggestion
is
that
you
could
have
the
machinery
for
the
4,000
cases
could
be
handled
for
a
million
dollars?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
not
talking
about
administrative?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
i
was
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh,
i
see.
i
was
thinking
of
the
figure
that
is
in
a
footnote,
i
think
in
the
goldberg
case
or
the
parallel
new
york
case
that
in
los
angeles
county
alone,
the
12,000
employees
who
serviced
the
welfare
recipients
and
therefore
a
million
dollar
figure
would
not
go
very
far
as
being
(voice
overlap).
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
would
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
while
i
have
you
interrupted
mr.
sayler,
i
suppose
you
would
agree
that
in
some
respect,
this
program
is
analogous
to
a
private
insurance
contract
for
disability
insurance,
the
standards
i
suspect
are
very
much
the
same,
total
and
permanent
disability.
in
general
there
is
an
analogy
there,
would
you
agree?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
happens
to
a
policy
holder
in
a
life
insurance
or
accident
insurance
is
receiving
total
and
permanent
disability
from
let
us
say
the
aetna
or
one
of
the
other
large
companies
and
they
discover
that
he
is
working
full
time
and
making
5,
6,
$8,000.00
a
year,
what
do
they
do
to
his
payments
ordinarily?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
he
is
earning
a
lot
of
money.
that
he
is
no
longer
totally
and
permanently
disabled.
they
would
terminate
it,
would
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
will
write
him
a
letter
and
tell
him
his
payments
are
being
stopped,
do
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
am
assuming
that
they
have
found
these
circumstances
of
his
earnings
prior
to
an
inquiry
and
perhaps
sent
investigators
out
who
watch
him
leave
in
the
morning
and
in
a
very
large
case,
you
probably
known
of
them,
take
moving
pictures
of
him,
the
man
playing
golf
or
whatever
it
may
be.
i
am
sure
you
do
not
have
any
welfare
recipients
doing
that,
but
you
--
this
is
the
technique
that
an
insurance
company
employee
--
employees
had
been
--
they
sent
him
a
letter
and
stop
the
payments,
do
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
would
you
analyze
--
analogize
that
to
a
man
who
has
bought,
taken
an
insurance
policy
privately?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
the
aetna
insurance
company,
for
example,
must
give
notice
before
they
terminate
payments
and
a
hearing
as
a
matter
of
due
process?
now,
i
am
not
talking
about
what
they
do,
what
their
practices
are,
what
their
contract
provides,
but
would
it
be
the
constitutional
obligation
in
a
private
insurance
of
disability
--
for
disability?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
sayler.
mr.
gray
you
have
three
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
