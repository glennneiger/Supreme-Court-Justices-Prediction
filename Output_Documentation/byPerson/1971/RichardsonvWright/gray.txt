mr.
gray
good
afternoon
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
these
two
cases
are
here
before
the
court
on
cross
appeals
and
have
been
consolidated
for
purposes
of
argument.
these
cases
arise
from
a
final
judgment,
a
statutory
three-judge
court
for
the
united
states
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia.
the
court
below
held
that
section
225
of
the
social
security
act
was
unconstitutional
and
that
under
that
act
the
recipient
of
the
social
security
disability
insurance
was
not
afforded
the
opportunity
for
an
oral
hearing
prior
to
suspension.
the
court
below
relied
on
the
decision
of
this
court
in
a
recent
case,
goldberg
v.
kelly,
which
has
since
become
rather
well-known
in
this
particular
field
of
the
law.
section
225
of
the
social
security
act
permits
the
secretary
of
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
on
information
obtained
by
him
or
submitted
to
him
to
suspend
the
benefits,
the
payments
to
a
social
security
disability
insurance
recipient
pending
further
investigation.
this
particular
section
of
the
social
security
act
has
no
provision
whatsoever
for
a
hearing.
it
should
be
noted
also
your
honors
that
this
particular
section
of
the
social
security
act
has
been
commented
on
in
the
floor
debates
of
the
congress
and
in
the
reports
of
the
various
committees
of
the
congress
and
its
purpose
has
been
explicitly
stated
to
permit
the
secretary
to
protect
the
social
security
trust
funds
to
administer
the
social
security
disability
insurance
program
in
a
practical,
efficient
and
helpful
manner
so
as
to
assist
the
maximum
number
of
beneficiaries
within
the
resources
available.
this
case
first
arose
when
the
appellee,
cross
appellant,
one
radie
wright,
applied
in
the
washington
d.c.
district
office
for
social
security
benefits.
mr.
wright
had
worked
since
the
age
of
14
and
had
been
recently
hospitalized
in
october
of
1965
to
be
exact
in
his
application,
for
social
security
disability
insurance
benefits
which
was
filed
june
1,
1966.
mr.
gray
no
sir,
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
is
not
quite
the
case.
he
has
adopted
procedures
suggested
by
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
to
a
certain
extent
and
i
would
--
mr.
gray
not
going
as
far
as
the
holding
of
the
district
court
nor
as
far
as
the
cross
appellants
would
like
the
secretary
to
go.
mr.
gray
they
would
not
go
as
far
i
do
your
honor.
mr.
gray
they
would
go
--
let
me
tell
you
perhaps
your
honor
right
at
this
point
in
time
what
they
would
do.
the
district
court
below,
as
a
part
of
its
holding,
stated
that
the
recipient
should
receive
timely
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
respond
and
the
secretary
has
gone
that
far
in
his
new
regulations
going
out
through
the
social
security
disability
insurance
system
to
state
that
state
agencies
shall
not
recommend
suspension
until
they
contact
that
recipient.
give
him
timely
notice,
offer
him
the
opportunity
to
present
his
case
which
i
might
--
mr.
gray
yes.
there
would
be
no
suspension
or
recommendation
initiated
sir.
i
might
point
out,
mr.
justice
brennan,
as
you
well
know,
your
honor
that
at
this
point
in
time
a
recipient
or
an
applicant
can
come
right
into
that
district
office
now
at
the
very
first
step
of
intake
with
counsel
in
tow
and
can
have
that
counsel
assisting
at
every
step
of
the
proceeding
right
along,
right
up
to
the
point
that
--
mr.
gray
yes
sir.
mr.
gray
yes
sir,
i
was
about
to
tell
you
that
right
now
mr.
justice
blackmun.
the
district
court
below
thought
that
as
an
additional
step
there
might
be
an
occasion
on
which
an
informal
hearing
could
be
held
before
an
impartial
official
or
hearing
examiner
and
they
also
went
one
step
further
and
said
that
when
the
evidence
is
found
to
contradict
that
evidence
held
by
the
social
security
administration
there
might
very
well
be
a
formal
hearing
and
the
next
step
they
took
was
to
say
that
we
are
not
going
to
prejudge
this
matter.
we
are
going
to
permit
the
social
security
administration
to
develop
pre-suspension
procedures
at
which
time
they
would
then
take
a
look
and
see
if
those
procedures
meet
all
the
requirements
that
we
are
laying
out
here
and
the
government’s
position
in
the
court
here
today
your
honors
is
that
we
go
along
with
the
first
part
of
the
court’s
order
below
and
we
agree
that
--
mr.
gray
yes
sir,
timely
notice
--
mr.
gray
that
is
right.
mr.
gray
in
the
form
of
written
submissions.
mr.
gray
no
hearing
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
gray
they
are
considered
right
up
the
line.
they
would
become
a
part
of
that
claimant’s
file
folder
and
they
would
become
a
part
right
there
at
the
state
agency
and
would
carry
right
on
at
the
line
all
the
way
into
the
federal
district
court
for
review.
mr.
gray
we
do
not
--
mr.
gray
well,
he
gets
a
--
in
our
regulations
too
he
also
gets
a
second
chance
at
that
same
state
agency
level.
he
does
not
come
in
right
away
and
the
state
agency
still
is
of
that
mind,
they
notify
him
again
and
he
is
given
ten
days
more
--
mr.
gray
to
do
the
same
thing,
file
a
written
submission,
but
the
extent
of
his
relief
there,
your
honor
in
fact
is
a
--
mr.
gray
that
is
correct.
mr.
gray
that
is
correct.
on
a
basis
of
what
he
submits
in
writing
your
honor
and
in
addition
what
the
state
agency
has
compiled
in
the
way
of
evidence
from
the
hospitals,
the
physicians,
the
laboratory,
the
vocational
rehabilitation
people
that
treated
him.
mr.
gray
let
me
say
that
he
gets
no
opportunity
but
i
think
your
honor,
he
gets
no
opportunity
in
a
legal
sense
as
we
lawyers
understand
it.
but
let
me
say
your
honor
that
the
social
security
administration,
as
you
well
know
and
this
court
knows,
leans
over
backwards
to
be
of
help
and
assistance
to
individuals
and
i
have
not,
despite
this
doubt
in
my
mind,
and
i
think
if
secretary
richardson
was
standing
before
this
court
he
would
say
the
same
thing.
if
that
recipient
came
in
to
that
state
agency
down
there
in
virginia
which
involves
one
of
these
cases,
the
cross
appellant
atkins,
with
his
attorney
and
told
that
that
state
agency
would
permit
that
recipient
and
his
attorney
to
make
all
the
points
they
wanted
to
make
right
there
and
they
would
build
that
record
and
that
record
would
move
right
on
up
the
line
just
as
they
desire
to
build
it.
but
if
you
are
speaking
your
honor
in
terms
of
a
hearing
as
we
understand
it
under
the
due
process
clause,
with
all
of
the
protections
that
your
honors
specified
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
which
you
have
delivered
in
goldberg,
no,
we
do
not
have
seen
it
all
--
(voice
overlap).
mr.
gray
not
the
times
that
we
mentioned
your
honor
in
our
supplemental
brief.
mr.
gray
but
other
things
were
done
with
which
of
course
are
--
they
are
in
my
statement
of
facts
that
--
mr.
gray
that
is
correct.
mr.
gray
that
is
correct
too.
mr.
gray
but
the
secretary
--
i
think
it
must
be
the
--
it
must
be
stated
mr.
chief
justice
if
the
new
regulation
of
the
secretary,
appearing
in
our
supplemental
brief,
was
developed
and
published
as
a
result
of
a
portion
of
the
opinion
of
the
three-judge
court
below
sir.
mr.
gray
yes
sir
because
of
the
part
--
mr.
gray
it
comes
a
part
of
the
claimant’s
folder
and
it
goes
--
mr.
gray
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
marshall.
it
goes
in
--
mr.
gray
i
do
not
think
that
the
--
that
statement
can
be
made
mr.
justice
marshall
because
in
these
types
of
cases,
unlike
other
cases
the
claimant
either
goes
to
work,
his
work
activity,
he
holds
in
his
hands
a
control,
his
work
activity,
generates
activity
--
mr.
gray
or
his
improved
--
yes
sir,
or
in
the
improvement
in
his
physical
condition.
so,
we
do
not
have
a
claimant
here
who
is
blinded
your
honor.
we
have
a
claimant
here
who
really
knows
--
mr.
gray
i
do
not
think
that
he
would
know
what
this
person
said
about
him.
mr.
gray
no
sir.
he
would
know
what
his
own
position
said
about
him
certainly.
mr.
gray
i
would
say
that
you
are
correct,
mr.
justice
marshall,
in
that
he
does
not
look
at
it,
but
what
i
said
before
in
the
response
to
a
question
of
mr.
justice
brennan
and
i
think
if
secretary
richardson
were
here,
he
would
say
it,
that
if
that
claimant
walked
into
that
state
agency
with
his
attorney,
he
would
get
it.
mr.
gray
i
know
but
that
does
not
mean
(voice
overlap).
that
is
right,
they
are
human
beings,
they
are
very
interested
in
the
fairness
and
integrity
of
the
--
mr.
gray
oh,
i
know
in
some
cases
you
do
for
certain
reasons
which
do
not
exist
in
these
cases
your
honor.
mr.
gray
we
feel
that
there
is
no
over
palling
individual
private
reason
to
hold
a
hearing
here
that
is
so
great
that
it
necessarily
must
override
in
our
system
of
jurisprudence
of
governmental
function
representing
the
interest
of
so
many
people
that
are
at
stake
in
the
administration
of
this
program.
mr.
gray
perales,
--
i
find
that,
i
find
comfort
in
both
cases.
in
perales
because
of
the
opinion
and
the
extent
to
which
that
opinion
went
and
in
the
court’s
holding
there
in
java.
the
court,
as
you
know
mr.
justice
blackmun,
did
not
reach
the
constitutional
question
raised
in
that
unemployment
compensation
case
on
the
west
coast.
i
feel,
of
course,
that
that
lower
court
was
in
error
and
i
think
there
is
a
case
now
in
new
york
(inaudible)
and
the
new
york
state
labor
department
where
contrary
result
was
reached
in
the
java
case.
mr.
gray
well,
i
think
that
is
certainly
is
true.
then
we
might
go
even
a
little
further
than
we
went
in
perales
in
trying
to
explain
in
a
little
greater
detail
the
procedures
that
are
involved
here
because
we
feel
that
these
procedures
are
the
matrix
in
which
the
government
case
rests.
these
are
the
things
that
this
court
must
look
at
first
to
see
whether
the
constitutional
rights
of
these
individuals
who
are
to
benefit
from
this
system
enacted
by
the
congress
are
being
infringed
upon
and
we
rather
vigorously
convene
in
our
brief
that
they
are
not.
that
the
governmental
function
must
prevail.
we
do
not
argue
that
the
public
purse
necessarily
is
so
sacred.
we
say
more
than
the
conservation
is
involved
here.
it
is
rather
the
allocation
of
these
resources.
shall
these
resources
be
allocated
to
assist
others
who
are
in
need
to
maximum
and
it
to
extent
or
shall
they
be
tied
up
in
a
vast
hearing
bureaucracy
for
which
there
is
no
real
constitutional
need
in
these
types
of
cases.
this
case,
these
facts
are
not
a
goldberg
context
at
all.
i
do
not
see
that
context
here.
mr.
gray
mr.
wright
went
in
and
made
this
application
and
at
the
time
he
made
the
application,
he
completed
item
21
of
the
application
and
he
also
received
the
standard
information
which
every
applicant
receives
that
if
he
goes
back
to
work,
he
should
report
that.
if
his
physical
condition
improves,
he
should
report
that.
if
he
applies
for
workman’s
compensation,
he
should
report
that.
his
application
was
completed.
the
district
office
referred
it
to
the
state
agency,
which
is
the
department
of
vocational
rehabilitation
here
in
the
district
of
columbia.
all
the
papers,
including
his
records
from
freedman’s
hospital
and
from
the
veteran’s
administration,
all
were
examined
and
a
decision
was
made
that
mr.
wright
was
indeed
disabled
within
the
meaning
of
the
of
the
terms
of
the
act.
his
illness,
in
point
of
fact,
was
rather
severe
at
the
time
following
his
hospitalization
for
hemorrhaging
and
it
stemmed
all
around
cirrhosis
to
the
liver,
hypertension,
chronic
gastritis
and
in
fact,
the
social
security
administration,
their
bdi,
bureau
of
disability
insurance
deemed
his
physical
condition
to
be
so
severe
that
he
was
not
routinely
programmed
ahead
for
a
review
as
they
do
regularly,
in
order
once
again,
to
keep
track
of
all
these
applicants.
time
passed,
this
was
in
1966
and
he
began
receiving
payments
from
may
1,
time
passed
and
mr.
wright
apparently
began
to
feel
better
because
in
1970,
earnings
began
to
show
up
in
the
bureau
of
disability
insurance
for
mr.
wright.
now,
how
did
they
show
up?
the
employers,
in
reporting
these
earnings,
report
them
to,
of
course
the
internal
revenue
service
which
in
turn
reports
them
over
to
the
social
security
administration
for
posting
in
the
social
security
account
and
those
folks
know
who
is
receiving
social
security
disability
insurance
and
there
is
a
transfer,
a
cross-indexing
so
that
a
recipient
of
social
security
disability
insurance
working
and
receiving
earnings
will
have
wage
postings
on
his
account
and
this
occurs
within
the
social
security
administration.
when
bdi
learned
of
earnings
for
mr.
wright,
earnings
for
the
june
quarter
of
1968
for
the
december
quarter
of
1968
and
for
the
first
quarter
of
1969,
they
immediately
cause
the
field
investigation
to
be
instituted
and
that
referral
was
made
to
the
social
security
district
office
in
the
district
of
columbia.
an
interviewer
went
to
call
upon
mr.
wright.
the
interview
was
less
than
satisfactory.
mr.
wright
was
a
little
difficult
to
communicate
with,
but
he
did
indicate
that
he
had
worked.
the
young
lady
who
interviewed
him
stated
to
him
that
indeed,
it
looked
as
though
his
social
security
disability
insurance
benefits
might
be
in
jeopardy
because
of
his
having
worked.
that
of
course
is
one
of
the
provisions
of
the
social
security
act,
one
of
the
definitions
of
disability,
if
an
individual
is
able
to
engage
in
substantial
gain
from
activity
he
cannot
be
disabled
under
the
act.
well,
the
investigation
proceeded
and
as
it
turned
out,
mr.
wright
had
indeed,
apparently
felt
better
because
he
worked,
he
not
only
worked
in
the
june
1968
quarter
to
december
1968
quarter,
that
he
worked
in
every
quarter
of
the
calendar
year
1969
and
he
earned
approximately
six
hundred
dollars
and
some
cents
in
1968
and
four
thousand
and
fort-one
dollars
and
some
cents
in
1969.
now,
when
all
these
verification
went
through
in
the
district
–-
mr.
gray
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
time
lag
here
is
a
little
long
because
normally
it
is
nine
months.
mr.
gray
before
it
gets
to
bdi
and
before
bdi
triggers
of
the
field
investigation.
mr.
gray
from
the
reporting
of
the
employer,
(voice
overlap)
mr.
gray
yes
sir,
when
the
employer
has
to
report
earnings
to
the
social
--
to
the
internal
revenue
service
and
-–
mr.
gray
and
it
was
a
little
–-
mr.
gray
it
was
a
little
longer
in
this
case
because
bdi
instituted
their
field
investigation
in
february
2,
1970,
but
in
any
event
that
when
that
was
compiled,
bdi
sent
the
report
back
to
the
district
of
columbia,
department
of
vocational
rehabilitation
for
a
further
look
at
this
case,
even
though
here
it
was
obvious,
that
the
man
had
worked,
was
in
violation,
no
longer
disabled,
no
longer
entitled
under
the
law,
but
the
case
folder
went
back.
an
additional
look-see
was
taken
and
the
district
office
concluded
that
mr.
wright
had
indeed
engaged
in
substantial
gainful
activity
and
was
no
longer
therefore
entitled
to
social
security
disability
benefits.
he
was
so
notified
and
the
letter
of
notification
indicated
that
his
trial
work
period
had
completed.
there
is
another
distinguishing
feature
from
the
welfare
recipient.
the
social
security
disability
recipient
may
work
for
a
period
of
nine
months,
none
of
which
need
be
consecutive,
but
the
law,
that
congress
has
seen
fit
and
the
secretary
in
his
implementing
regulations
has
seemed
fit
to
permit
this
recipient
to
go
back
and
try
to
rehabilitate
himself.
try
to
get
back
into
the
mainstream,
the
society
so
to
speak.
mr.
wright
had
indeed,
utilized
more
than
his
nine
months
trial
work
period.
and
he
was
determined
to
have
ceased
to
be
disabled
as
of
august
of
1969,
and
his
benefits,
he
was
advised
that
his
benefits
were
going
to
be
suspended
and
they
were
indeed
suspended
for
a
short
period
of
time.
mr.
gray
sir?
mr.
gray
i
must
presume
it
is
because
based
on
my
own
knowledge
mr.
justice
marshall,
from
having
been
in
hew
that
knowing
that
ssa
is
heavily
computerized,
it
is
the
only
way
they
could
handle
the
workload
that
they
handle
it
and
i
must
assume
that
that
is
correct.
mr.
gray
that
is
at
the
district
office
level
mr.
justice
marshal.
mr.
gray
oh,
we
do
not
rely
on
the
computer
at
all.
we
would
be
violated
to
that
mr.
justice
marshall.
a
verification
is
made
if
this
wages
paid
by
direct
contact
with
the
recording
employer.
no
reliance
is
placed
on
that
computer
for
that
kind
of
verification.
mr.
gray
that
is
right.
that
is
a
micro
switch
mr.
chief
justice.
it
begins
this
whole
procedures,
it
starts
at
all
doing.
mr.
gray
no
sir.
in
any
event,
mr.
wright
brought
the
suit
and
he
was
without
benefits
for
a
short
period
of
time.
he
brought
suit
on
may
13,
1970.
on
may
14,
1970,
judge
gasch
issued
a
temporary
restraining
order
restraining
the
secretary
from
suspending
mr.
wright’s
benefits
and
that
action
was
taken
and
mr.
wright
has
been
paid
the
benefits
since
then.
and
then
mr.
john
d.
atkins,
plaintiff
intervener,
enters
this
case.
he
does
not
come
into
the
case
until
about
august,
but
he
comes
in
as
a
plaintiff
intervener
on
the
basis
that
he
had
been
hospitalized
by
reason
of
mental
illness.
and
he
was
hospitalized
over
in
the
veterans
administration
hospital
at
perry
point,
maryland.
and
he
was
hospitalized
in
december
of
1966
and
began
receiving
benefits
some
six
months
thereafter
and
remained
in
that
hospital
over
there
until
january
7
of
1969.
the
social
security
administration,
for
some
reason
or
another,
did
not
find
out
that
mr.
atkins
was
no
longer
in
perry
point
until
about
september
of
1969
when
his
check
was
returned
from
perry
point
va
hospital
to
the
social
security
administration
to
bdi.
apparently,
perry
point
had
been
forwarding
his
checks
to
mr.
atkins
because
mr.
atkins
had
left
the
va
hospital
at
perry
point,
maryland
and
had
gone
over
to
virginia
to
another
hospital,
mental
hospital,
western
hospital
at
salem,
virginia,
stayed
there,
a
short
period
of
time
then
went
down
to
the
veteran’s
administration
hospital
at
roanoke.
but
when
social
security
received
the
notice,
received
the
check
back
that
immediately
triggered
off
in
accordance
with
its
procedures
a
continuing
disability
investigation
and
they
had
to
find
out
what
mr.
atkins
was
up
to.
so,
the
claim
folder
went
first
to
towson,
maryland
and
then
it
went
down
to
virginia,
but
suffice
to
say
the
case
finally
became
one
before
the
state
agency
there
in
virginia.
the
state
agency
went
through
the
same
routine.
they
contacted
mr.
atkins,
talked
with
his
clinical
psychologist,
looked
very,
very
carefully
at
the
medical
evidence
then
available
to
them
and
made
a
decision
that
mr.
atkins
condition
had
physically
improved
sufficiently
so
that
he
was
no
longer
disabled.
mr.
atkins,
this
occurred
on
february
3,
1970,
on
february
4,
1970,
mr.
atkins
wrote
to
social
security
administration
and
protested,
submitted
his
own
evidence.
his
wife
called
bdi
three
or
four
times.
his
congressman
got
in
touched
with
social
security
administration
and
to
compress
the
facts
in
view
the
fact
time
is
rapidly
running
out
on
me,
your
honors,
he
was
reinstated.
his
case
was
sent
back
rather
quickly.
another
hard
look
was
taken
at
additional
evidence
and
he
was
reinstated
and
i
think
if
i
may
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
any
rebuttal.
mr.
gray
not
at
all,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
our
basic
proposition
is
that
cafeteria
established
basic
propositions
which
have
been
set
forth
in
number
of
other
cases
that
the
court
is
obliged
to
indulge
in
a
balancing
of
the
interest
of
the
government
on
the
one
side,
and
persons
affected
by
governmental
interest
on
the
other
side.
we
think
this
is
the
case
where
the
balance
must
be
struck
very
much
on
the
side
of
the
recipient
in
view
of
depressing
the
disability
payments.
we
have
indicated
the
statistics
in
our
brief
on
this
point.
facts
are
that
disability
recipients
are
over
half
dependent
on
disability
benefits
for
their
income.
most
of
them
are
over
80%
dependent.
as
a
category,
the
disability
recipients
have
very
low
level
of
educational
attainment
which
very
much
hampers
their
prospects
to
gain
substantial
income
once
they
are
terminated
the
disability
role.
their
work
experience,
even
those
who
are
able
to
work,
is
not
very
bright
and
their
labor
experience
is
characterized
by
extremely
high
unemployment.
it
is
characterized
by
mostly
part
time
work.
our
point
is
that
the
prospect
of
a
man
who
is
cut-off
from
the
disability
program,
a
man
who
must
have
qualified
in
the
first
instance
under
the
most
rigid
definition
of
disability.
that
is
not
a
man
who
is
in
any
sense
a
potential
olympic
champion.
there
is
a
man
who
needs
those
moneys
and
that
is
why
congress
has
provided
them
to
him.
he
needs
them
in
the
same
sense
that
the
welfare
recipient
needed
those
moneys
in
the
goldberg
situation.
mr.
gray
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
just
to
make
a
brief
comment
regarding
mr.
sayler’s
statement
concerning
reversal
rate.
the
appendix
d
in
the
government’s
brief
contains
the
statistics
for
fiscal
year
1971
and
much
can
be
done
with
figures
as
we
all
know
and
i
think
the
only
fair
way
to
handle
this
particular
matter
of
the
reversal
rate
and
the
--
that
play
on
numbers
is
to
take
the
actual
number
of
claims
that
are
processed
and
then
trace
those
through
and
find
the
reversals
and
that
brings
you
to
a
6.6%
rate
of
reversal.
that
speaks
something
for
the
system.
at
least,
there
are
sufficient
number
of
individuals
somewhere
throughout
this
total
number
of
claims
who
do
not
feel
that
the
system
has
dealt
with
them
unfairly
and
i
would
merely
submit
to
the
court
that
this
kind
of
a
consideration
be
given
to
dealing
with
statistics.
i
would
like
also
to
point
out
once
again
and
reaffirm
the
fact
that
the
government
has
not
conceded
anything.
this
is
not
summary
decapitation
that
we
are
engaged
in
here
and
we
have
never
considered
it
to
be
and
we
have
not
conceded
any
point
of
constitutionality
and
we
standby
firmly
the
points
made
in
our
brief
to
this
honorable
court.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
gray
good
afternoon
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
these
two
cases
are
here
before
the
court
on
cross
appeals
and
have
been
consolidated
for
purposes
of
argument.
these
cases
arise
from
a
final
judgment,
a
statutory
three-judge
court
for
the
united
states
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia.
the
court
below
held
that
section
225
of
the
social
security
act
was
unconstitutional
and
that
under
that
act
the
recipient
of
the
social
security
disability
insurance
was
not
afforded
the
opportunity
for
an
oral
hearing
prior
to
suspension.
the
court
below
relied
on
the
decision
of
this
court
in
a
recent
case,
goldberg
v.
kelly,
which
has
since
become
rather
well-known
in
this
particular
field
of
the
law.
section
225
of
the
social
security
act
permits
the
secretary
of
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
on
information
obtained
by
him
or
submitted
to
him
to
suspend
the
benefits,
the
payments
to
a
social
security
disability
insurance
recipient
pending
further
investigation.
this
particular
section
of
the
social
security
act
has
no
provision
whatsoever
for
a
hearing.
it
should
be
noted
also
your
honors
that
this
particular
section
of
the
social
security
act
has
been
commented
on
in
the
floor
debates
of
the
congress
and
in
the
reports
of
the
various
committees
of
the
congress
and
its
purpose
has
been
explicitly
stated
to
permit
the
secretary
to
protect
the
social
security
trust
funds
to
administer
the
social
security
disability
insurance
program
in
a
practical,
efficient
and
helpful
manner
so
as
to
assist
the
maximum
number
of
beneficiaries
within
the
resources
available.
this
case
first
arose
when
the
appellee,
cross
appellant,
one
radie
wright,
applied
in
the
washington
d.c.
district
office
for
social
security
benefits.
mr.
wright
had
worked
since
the
age
of
14
and
had
been
recently
hospitalized
in
october
of
1965
to
be
exact
in
his
application,
for
social
security
disability
insurance
benefits
which
was
filed
june
1,
1966.
mr.
gray
no
sir,
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
is
not
quite
the
case.
he
has
adopted
procedures
suggested
by
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
to
a
certain
extent
and
i
would
--
mr.
gray
not
going
as
far
as
the
holding
of
the
district
court
nor
as
far
as
the
cross
appellants
would
like
the
secretary
to
go.
mr.
gray
they
would
not
go
as
far
i
do
your
honor.
mr.
gray
they
would
go
--
let
me
tell
you
perhaps
your
honor
right
at
this
point
in
time
what
they
would
do.
the
district
court
below,
as
a
part
of
its
holding,
stated
that
the
recipient
should
receive
timely
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
respond
and
the
secretary
has
gone
that
far
in
his
new
regulations
going
out
through
the
social
security
disability
insurance
system
to
state
that
state
agencies
shall
not
recommend
suspension
until
they
contact
that
recipient.
give
him
timely
notice,
offer
him
the
opportunity
to
present
his
case
which
i
might
--
mr.
gray
yes.
there
would
be
no
suspension
or
recommendation
initiated
sir.
i
might
point
out,
mr.
justice
brennan,
as
you
well
know,
your
honor
that
at
this
point
in
time
a
recipient
or
an
applicant
can
come
right
into
that
district
office
now
at
the
very
first
step
of
intake
with
counsel
in
tow
and
can
have
that
counsel
assisting
at
every
step
of
the
proceeding
right
along,
right
up
to
the
point
that
--
mr.
gray
yes
sir.
mr.
gray
yes
sir,
i
was
about
to
tell
you
that
right
now
mr.
justice
blackmun.
the
district
court
below
thought
that
as
an
additional
step
there
might
be
an
occasion
on
which
an
informal
hearing
could
be
held
before
an
impartial
official
or
hearing
examiner
and
they
also
went
one
step
further
and
said
that
when
the
evidence
is
found
to
contradict
that
evidence
held
by
the
social
security
administration
there
might
very
well
be
a
formal
hearing
and
the
next
step
they
took
was
to
say
that
we
are
not
going
to
prejudge
this
matter.
we
are
going
to
permit
the
social
security
administration
to
develop
pre-suspension
procedures
at
which
time
they
would
then
take
a
look
and
see
if
those
procedures
meet
all
the
requirements
that
we
are
laying
out
here
and
the
government’s
position
in
the
court
here
today
your
honors
is
that
we
go
along
with
the
first
part
of
the
court’s
order
below
and
we
agree
that
--
mr.
gray
yes
sir,
timely
notice
--
mr.
gray
that
is
right.
mr.
gray
in
the
form
of
written
submissions.
mr.
gray
no
hearing
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
gray
they
are
considered
right
up
the
line.
they
would
become
a
part
of
that
claimant’s
file
folder
and
they
would
become
a
part
right
there
at
the
state
agency
and
would
carry
right
on
at
the
line
all
the
way
into
the
federal
district
court
for
review.
mr.
gray
we
do
not
--
mr.
gray
well,
he
gets
a
--
in
our
regulations
too
he
also
gets
a
second
chance
at
that
same
state
agency
level.
he
does
not
come
in
right
away
and
the
state
agency
still
is
of
that
mind,
they
notify
him
again
and
he
is
given
ten
days
more
--
mr.
gray
to
do
the
same
thing,
file
a
written
submission,
but
the
extent
of
his
relief
there,
your
honor
in
fact
is
a
--
mr.
gray
that
is
correct.
mr.
gray
that
is
correct.
on
a
basis
of
what
he
submits
in
writing
your
honor
and
in
addition
what
the
state
agency
has
compiled
in
the
way
of
evidence
from
the
hospitals,
the
physicians,
the
laboratory,
the
vocational
rehabilitation
people
that
treated
him.
mr.
gray
let
me
say
that
he
gets
no
opportunity
but
i
think
your
honor,
he
gets
no
opportunity
in
a
legal
sense
as
we
lawyers
understand
it.
but
let
me
say
your
honor
that
the
social
security
administration,
as
you
well
know
and
this
court
knows,
leans
over
backwards
to
be
of
help
and
assistance
to
individuals
and
i
have
not,
despite
this
doubt
in
my
mind,
and
i
think
if
secretary
richardson
was
standing
before
this
court
he
would
say
the
same
thing.
if
that
recipient
came
in
to
that
state
agency
down
there
in
virginia
which
involves
one
of
these
cases,
the
cross
appellant
atkins,
with
his
attorney
and
told
that
that
state
agency
would
permit
that
recipient
and
his
attorney
to
make
all
the
points
they
wanted
to
make
right
there
and
they
would
build
that
record
and
that
record
would
move
right
on
up
the
line
just
as
they
desire
to
build
it.
but
if
you
are
speaking
your
honor
in
terms
of
a
hearing
as
we
understand
it
under
the
due
process
clause,
with
all
of
the
protections
that
your
honors
specified
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
which
you
have
delivered
in
goldberg,
no,
we
do
not
have
seen
it
all
--
(voice
overlap).
mr.
gray
not
the
times
that
we
mentioned
your
honor
in
our
supplemental
brief.
mr.
gray
but
other
things
were
done
with
which
of
course
are
--
they
are
in
my
statement
of
facts
that
--
mr.
gray
that
is
correct.
mr.
gray
that
is
correct
too.
mr.
gray
but
the
secretary
--
i
think
it
must
be
the
--
it
must
be
stated
mr.
chief
justice
if
the
new
regulation
of
the
secretary,
appearing
in
our
supplemental
brief,
was
developed
and
published
as
a
result
of
a
portion
of
the
opinion
of
the
three-judge
court
below
sir.
mr.
gray
yes
sir
because
of
the
part
--
mr.
gray
it
comes
a
part
of
the
claimant’s
folder
and
it
goes
--
mr.
gray
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
marshall.
it
goes
in
--
mr.
gray
i
do
not
think
that
the
--
that
statement
can
be
made
mr.
justice
marshall
because
in
these
types
of
cases,
unlike
other
cases
the
claimant
either
goes
to
work,
his
work
activity,
he
holds
in
his
hands
a
control,
his
work
activity,
generates
activity
--
mr.
gray
or
his
improved
--
yes
sir,
or
in
the
improvement
in
his
physical
condition.
so,
we
do
not
have
a
claimant
here
who
is
blinded
your
honor.
we
have
a
claimant
here
who
really
knows
--
mr.
gray
i
do
not
think
that
he
would
know
what
this
person
said
about
him.
mr.
gray
no
sir.
he
would
know
what
his
own
position
said
about
him
certainly.
mr.
gray
i
would
say
that
you
are
correct,
mr.
justice
marshall,
in
that
he
does
not
look
at
it,
but
what
i
said
before
in
the
response
to
a
question
of
mr.
justice
brennan
and
i
think
if
secretary
richardson
were
here,
he
would
say
it,
that
if
that
claimant
walked
into
that
state
agency
with
his
attorney,
he
would
get
it.
mr.
gray
i
know
but
that
does
not
mean
(voice
overlap).
that
is
right,
they
are
human
beings,
they
are
very
interested
in
the
fairness
and
integrity
of
the
--
mr.
gray
oh,
i
know
in
some
cases
you
do
for
certain
reasons
which
do
not
exist
in
these
cases
your
honor.
mr.
gray
we
feel
that
there
is
no
over
palling
individual
private
reason
to
hold
a
hearing
here
that
is
so
great
that
it
necessarily
must
override
in
our
system
of
jurisprudence
of
governmental
function
representing
the
interest
of
so
many
people
that
are
at
stake
in
the
administration
of
this
program.
mr.
gray
perales,
--
i
find
that,
i
find
comfort
in
both
cases.
in
perales
because
of
the
opinion
and
the
extent
to
which
that
opinion
went
and
in
the
court’s
holding
there
in
java.
the
court,
as
you
know
mr.
justice
blackmun,
did
not
reach
the
constitutional
question
raised
in
that
unemployment
compensation
case
on
the
west
coast.
i
feel,
of
course,
that
that
lower
court
was
in
error
and
i
think
there
is
a
case
now
in
new
york
(inaudible)
and
the
new
york
state
labor
department
where
contrary
result
was
reached
in
the
java
case.
mr.
gray
well,
i
think
that
is
certainly
is
true.
then
we
might
go
even
a
little
further
than
we
went
in
perales
in
trying
to
explain
in
a
little
greater
detail
the
procedures
that
are
involved
here
because
we
feel
that
these
procedures
are
the
matrix
in
which
the
government
case
rests.
these
are
the
things
that
this
court
must
look
at
first
to
see
whether
the
constitutional
rights
of
these
individuals
who
are
to
benefit
from
this
system
enacted
by
the
congress
are
being
infringed
upon
and
we
rather
vigorously
convene
in
our
brief
that
they
are
not.
that
the
governmental
function
must
prevail.
we
do
not
argue
that
the
public
purse
necessarily
is
so
sacred.
we
say
more
than
the
conservation
is
involved
here.
it
is
rather
the
allocation
of
these
resources.
shall
these
resources
be
allocated
to
assist
others
who
are
in
need
to
maximum
and
it
to
extent
or
shall
they
be
tied
up
in
a
vast
hearing
bureaucracy
for
which
there
is
no
real
constitutional
need
in
these
types
of
cases.
this
case,
these
facts
are
not
a
goldberg
context
at
all.
i
do
not
see
that
context
here.
mr.
gray
mr.
wright
went
in
and
made
this
application
and
at
the
time
he
made
the
application,
he
completed
item
21
of
the
application
and
he
also
received
the
standard
information
which
every
applicant
receives
that
if
he
goes
back
to
work,
he
should
report
that.
if
his
physical
condition
improves,
he
should
report
that.
if
he
applies
for
workman’s
compensation,
he
should
report
that.
his
application
was
completed.
the
district
office
referred
it
to
the
state
agency,
which
is
the
department
of
vocational
rehabilitation
here
in
the
district
of
columbia.
all
the
papers,
including
his
records
from
freedman’s
hospital
and
from
the
veteran’s
administration,
all
were
examined
and
a
decision
was
made
that
mr.
wright
was
indeed
disabled
within
the
meaning
of
the
of
the
terms
of
the
act.
his
illness,
in
point
of
fact,
was
rather
severe
at
the
time
following
his
hospitalization
for
hemorrhaging
and
it
stemmed
all
around
cirrhosis
to
the
liver,
hypertension,
chronic
gastritis
and
in
fact,
the
social
security
administration,
their
bdi,
bureau
of
disability
insurance
deemed
his
physical
condition
to
be
so
severe
that
he
was
not
routinely
programmed
ahead
for
a
review
as
they
do
regularly,
in
order
once
again,
to
keep
track
of
all
these
applicants.
time
passed,
this
was
in
1966
and
he
began
receiving
payments
from
may
1,
time
passed
and
mr.
wright
apparently
began
to
feel
better
because
in
1970,
earnings
began
to
show
up
in
the
bureau
of
disability
insurance
for
mr.
wright.
now,
how
did
they
show
up?
the
employers,
in
reporting
these
earnings,
report
them
to,
of
course
the
internal
revenue
service
which
in
turn
reports
them
over
to
the
social
security
administration
for
posting
in
the
social
security
account
and
those
folks
know
who
is
receiving
social
security
disability
insurance
and
there
is
a
transfer,
a
cross-indexing
so
that
a
recipient
of
social
security
disability
insurance
working
and
receiving
earnings
will
have
wage
postings
on
his
account
and
this
occurs
within
the
social
security
administration.
when
bdi
learned
of
earnings
for
mr.
wright,
earnings
for
the
june
quarter
of
1968
for
the
december
quarter
of
1968
and
for
the
first
quarter
of
1969,
they
immediately
cause
the
field
investigation
to
be
instituted
and
that
referral
was
made
to
the
social
security
district
office
in
the
district
of
columbia.
an
interviewer
went
to
call
upon
mr.
wright.
the
interview
was
less
than
satisfactory.
mr.
wright
was
a
little
difficult
to
communicate
with,
but
he
did
indicate
that
he
had
worked.
the
young
lady
who
interviewed
him
stated
to
him
that
indeed,
it
looked
as
though
his
social
security
disability
insurance
benefits
might
be
in
jeopardy
because
of
his
having
worked.
that
of
course
is
one
of
the
provisions
of
the
social
security
act,
one
of
the
definitions
of
disability,
if
an
individual
is
able
to
engage
in
substantial
gain
from
activity
he
cannot
be
disabled
under
the
act.
well,
the
investigation
proceeded
and
as
it
turned
out,
mr.
wright
had
indeed,
apparently
felt
better
because
he
worked,
he
not
only
worked
in
the
june
1968
quarter
to
december
1968
quarter,
that
he
worked
in
every
quarter
of
the
calendar
year
1969
and
he
earned
approximately
six
hundred
dollars
and
some
cents
in
1968
and
four
thousand
and
fort-one
dollars
and
some
cents
in
1969.
now,
when
all
these
verification
went
through
in
the
district
–-
mr.
gray
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
time
lag
here
is
a
little
long
because
normally
it
is
nine
months.
mr.
gray
before
it
gets
to
bdi
and
before
bdi
triggers
of
the
field
investigation.
mr.
gray
from
the
reporting
of
the
employer,
(voice
overlap)
mr.
gray
yes
sir,
when
the
employer
has
to
report
earnings
to
the
social
--
to
the
internal
revenue
service
and
-–
mr.
gray
and
it
was
a
little
–-
mr.
gray
it
was
a
little
longer
in
this
case
because
bdi
instituted
their
field
investigation
in
february
2,
1970,
but
in
any
event
that
when
that
was
compiled,
bdi
sent
the
report
back
to
the
district
of
columbia,
department
of
vocational
rehabilitation
for
a
further
look
at
this
case,
even
though
here
it
was
obvious,
that
the
man
had
worked,
was
in
violation,
no
longer
disabled,
no
longer
entitled
under
the
law,
but
the
case
folder
went
back.
an
additional
look-see
was
taken
and
the
district
office
concluded
that
mr.
wright
had
indeed
engaged
in
substantial
gainful
activity
and
was
no
longer
therefore
entitled
to
social
security
disability
benefits.
he
was
so
notified
and
the
letter
of
notification
indicated
that
his
trial
work
period
had
completed.
there
is
another
distinguishing
feature
from
the
welfare
recipient.
the
social
security
disability
recipient
may
work
for
a
period
of
nine
months,
none
of
which
need
be
consecutive,
but
the
law,
that
congress
has
seen
fit
and
the
secretary
in
his
implementing
regulations
has
seemed
fit
to
permit
this
recipient
to
go
back
and
try
to
rehabilitate
himself.
try
to
get
back
into
the
mainstream,
the
society
so
to
speak.
mr.
wright
had
indeed,
utilized
more
than
his
nine
months
trial
work
period.
and
he
was
determined
to
have
ceased
to
be
disabled
as
of
august
of
1969,
and
his
benefits,
he
was
advised
that
his
benefits
were
going
to
be
suspended
and
they
were
indeed
suspended
for
a
short
period
of
time.
mr.
gray
sir?
mr.
gray
i
must
presume
it
is
because
based
on
my
own
knowledge
mr.
justice
marshall,
from
having
been
in
hew
that
knowing
that
ssa
is
heavily
computerized,
it
is
the
only
way
they
could
handle
the
workload
that
they
handle
it
and
i
must
assume
that
that
is
correct.
mr.
gray
that
is
at
the
district
office
level
mr.
justice
marshal.
mr.
gray
oh,
we
do
not
rely
on
the
computer
at
all.
we
would
be
violated
to
that
mr.
justice
marshall.
a
verification
is
made
if
this
wages
paid
by
direct
contact
with
the
recording
employer.
no
reliance
is
placed
on
that
computer
for
that
kind
of
verification.
mr.
gray
that
is
right.
that
is
a
micro
switch
mr.
chief
justice.
it
begins
this
whole
procedures,
it
starts
at
all
doing.
mr.
gray
no
sir.
in
any
event,
mr.
wright
brought
the
suit
and
he
was
without
benefits
for
a
short
period
of
time.
he
brought
suit
on
may
13,
1970.
on
may
14,
1970,
judge
gasch
issued
a
temporary
restraining
order
restraining
the
secretary
from
suspending
mr.
wright’s
benefits
and
that
action
was
taken
and
mr.
wright
has
been
paid
the
benefits
since
then.
and
then
mr.
john
d.
atkins,
plaintiff
intervener,
enters
this
case.
he
does
not
come
into
the
case
until
about
august,
but
he
comes
in
as
a
plaintiff
intervener
on
the
basis
that
he
had
been
hospitalized
by
reason
of
mental
illness.
and
he
was
hospitalized
over
in
the
veterans
administration
hospital
at
perry
point,
maryland.
and
he
was
hospitalized
in
december
of
1966
and
began
receiving
benefits
some
six
months
thereafter
and
remained
in
that
hospital
over
there
until
january
7
of
1969.
the
social
security
administration,
for
some
reason
or
another,
did
not
find
out
that
mr.
atkins
was
no
longer
in
perry
point
until
about
september
of
1969
when
his
check
was
returned
from
perry
point
va
hospital
to
the
social
security
administration
to
bdi.
apparently,
perry
point
had
been
forwarding
his
checks
to
mr.
atkins
because
mr.
atkins
had
left
the
va
hospital
at
perry
point,
maryland
and
had
gone
over
to
virginia
to
another
hospital,
mental
hospital,
western
hospital
at
salem,
virginia,
stayed
there,
a
short
period
of
time
then
went
down
to
the
veteran’s
administration
hospital
at
roanoke.
but
when
social
security
received
the
notice,
received
the
check
back
that
immediately
triggered
off
in
accordance
with
its
procedures
a
continuing
disability
investigation
and
they
had
to
find
out
what
mr.
atkins
was
up
to.
so,
the
claim
folder
went
first
to
towson,
maryland
and
then
it
went
down
to
virginia,
but
suffice
to
say
the
case
finally
became
one
before
the
state
agency
there
in
virginia.
the
state
agency
went
through
the
same
routine.
they
contacted
mr.
atkins,
talked
with
his
clinical
psychologist,
looked
very,
very
carefully
at
the
medical
evidence
then
available
to
them
and
made
a
decision
that
mr.
atkins
condition
had
physically
improved
sufficiently
so
that
he
was
no
longer
disabled.
mr.
atkins,
this
occurred
on
february
3,
1970,
on
february
4,
1970,
mr.
atkins
wrote
to
social
security
administration
and
protested,
submitted
his
own
evidence.
his
wife
called
bdi
three
or
four
times.
his
congressman
got
in
touched
with
social
security
administration
and
to
compress
the
facts
in
view
the
fact
time
is
rapidly
running
out
on
me,
your
honors,
he
was
reinstated.
his
case
was
sent
back
rather
quickly.
another
hard
look
was
taken
at
additional
evidence
and
he
was
reinstated
and
i
think
if
i
may
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
any
rebuttal.
mr.
gray
not
at
all,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
our
basic
proposition
is
that
cafeteria
established
basic
propositions
which
have
been
set
forth
in
number
of
other
cases
that
the
court
is
obliged
to
indulge
in
a
balancing
of
the
interest
of
the
government
on
the
one
side,
and
persons
affected
by
governmental
interest
on
the
other
side.
we
think
this
is
the
case
where
the
balance
must
be
struck
very
much
on
the
side
of
the
recipient
in
view
of
depressing
the
disability
payments.
we
have
indicated
the
statistics
in
our
brief
on
this
point.
facts
are
that
disability
recipients
are
over
half
dependent
on
disability
benefits
for
their
income.
most
of
them
are
over
80%
dependent.
as
a
category,
the
disability
recipients
have
very
low
level
of
educational
attainment
which
very
much
hampers
their
prospects
to
gain
substantial
income
once
they
are
terminated
the
disability
role.
their
work
experience,
even
those
who
are
able
to
work,
is
not
very
bright
and
their
labor
experience
is
characterized
by
extremely
high
unemployment.
it
is
characterized
by
mostly
part
time
work.
our
point
is
that
the
prospect
of
a
man
who
is
cut-off
from
the
disability
program,
a
man
who
must
have
qualified
in
the
first
instance
under
the
most
rigid
definition
of
disability.
that
is
not
a
man
who
is
in
any
sense
a
potential
olympic
champion.
there
is
a
man
who
needs
those
moneys
and
that
is
why
congress
has
provided
them
to
him.
he
needs
them
in
the
same
sense
that
the
welfare
recipient
needed
those
moneys
in
the
goldberg
situation.
mr.
gray
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
just
to
make
a
brief
comment
regarding
mr.
sayler’s
statement
concerning
reversal
rate.
the
appendix
d
in
the
government’s
brief
contains
the
statistics
for
fiscal
year
1971
and
much
can
be
done
with
figures
as
we
all
know
and
i
think
the
only
fair
way
to
handle
this
particular
matter
of
the
reversal
rate
and
the
--
that
play
on
numbers
is
to
take
the
actual
number
of
claims
that
are
processed
and
then
trace
those
through
and
find
the
reversals
and
that
brings
you
to
a
6.6%
rate
of
reversal.
that
speaks
something
for
the
system.
at
least,
there
are
sufficient
number
of
individuals
somewhere
throughout
this
total
number
of
claims
who
do
not
feel
that
the
system
has
dealt
with
them
unfairly
and
i
would
merely
submit
to
the
court
that
this
kind
of
a
consideration
be
given
to
dealing
with
statistics.
i
would
like
also
to
point
out
once
again
and
reaffirm
the
fact
that
the
government
has
not
conceded
anything.
this
is
not
summary
decapitation
that
we
are
engaged
in
here
and
we
have
never
considered
it
to
be
and
we
have
not
conceded
any
point
of
constitutionality
and
we
standby
firmly
the
points
made
in
our
brief
to
this
honorable
court.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
