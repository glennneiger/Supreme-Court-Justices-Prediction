mr.
robert
n.
sayler
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
here
representing
several
named
individuals
in
the
class
of
disability
recipients.
the
government’s
presentation
has
made
clear
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
complicated
statutory
scheme.
that
should
not
obscure
the
fact
that
the
legal
issues
in
this
case
are
uncomplicated,
had
been
considerably
narrowed
in
this
court.
when
this
case
begun
nearly
two
years
ago,
the
government
was
arguing
that
the
provision
in
the
statute
authorizing
summary
suspension
of
disability
payments
was
constitutional.
now,
judges
gasch,
robb
and
matthews
disagreed.
the
government
has
abandoned
that
contention
and
this
court
it
concedes
that
that
statutory
section
is
unconstitutional
and
it
concedes
that
there
is
a
right
to
an
opportunity
to
a
hearing
before
disability
benefits
are
terminated.
now,
these
are
the
propositions
that
we
had
been
attempting
to
establish
in
this
case.
we
had
assumed
that
once
they
were
recognized
that
would
obviate
the
necessity
for
action
by
this
court
and
that
has
not
proved
to
be
the
case
because
in
this
court,
the
government
contends
that
the
right
to
a
hearing
it
would
provide
means
a
paper
hearing
and
calls
a
hearing
on
paper.
by
this,
the
government
says
it
would
provide
notice
if
it
found
conflicting
evidence.
it
would
provide
a
brief
summary
of
evidence
adverse
to
the
recipient,
providing
opportunity
to
file
his
paper.
it
would
not
under
any
circumstances,
regardless,
whether
or
not
conflicting
evidence
of
continuing
disability
existed.
it
would
not
provide
opportunity
for
an
oral
proceeding
of
any
kind,
would
not
assure
decision
by
an
impartial
decision
maker.
the
government’s
basic
position
is
that
these
latter
procedural
protections
are
unnecessary
because
the
decisions
in
this
area,
uniquely
objective
and
reliable,
as
mr.
gray
just
said,
the
government
bends
over
backwards
to
assure
that
recipients
may
stay
on
the
roles.
there
is
one
overwhelming
statistic
which
demonstrates
the
difficulty
the
government
has
in
sustaining
that
position.
present
time,
hearings
are
required
as
a
matter
of
statutory
right
after
termination,
many
months
down
the
road.
in
those
cases,
paper
determinations
that
disability
has
ceased
are
reversed
in
55%
of
the
cases.
more
times
than
not,
when
the
recipient
gets
to
the
hearing
has
an
opportunity
to
tell
his
the
story,
present
affirmative
evidence,
cross-examine
would
prevail.
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
yes,
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
that
is
right
your
honor.
the
statute
requires
that.
the
problem
of
course
during
many
months
--
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
the
statistics
in
the
record,
somewhere
between
four
and
six
months.
different
statistics
had
been
supplied
from
one
time
to
another.
they
are
all
set
out
in
the
briefs.
considerable
period
is
consumed
while
the
recipient
is
cut-off
from
payments.
once
he
gets
to
that
hearing,
more
times
than
not,
he
prevails.
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
that
is
my
understanding
on
the
basis
of
--
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
something
to
three
or
four
months
beyond
the
paper
--
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
that
is
right.
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
that
is
right,
just
as
was
the
case
in
the
welfare
area,
precisely
the
same.
and
we
think
that
that
55%
statistic
is
more
eloquent
than
pages
of
testimony
to
demonstrate
the
importance
of
the
protections
we
seek
and
the
inadequacy
of
the
procedures
that
are
now
followed
or
that
would
be
followed
under
the
protections
the
government
has
now
undertaken
to
provide.
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
your
honor,
we
take
from
goldberg
the
language
that
the
court
in
that
case
was
undertaking
to
prescribe
the
minimum,
what
it
called
the
rudimentary
bearing
up
of
due
process.
and
we
are
--
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
your
honor,
we
are
seeking
only
those
rudimentary
protections
provided
in
the
goldberg
situation.
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
yes.
the
average
recipient
receives
according
to
the
government’s
figure
something
along
the
lines
of
$200.00
a
month
and
the
government
has
undertaken
an
estimate
of
what
it
would
cost
hear
hearings,
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing
satisfying
the
goldberg
for
its
standards
and
it
is
determined
that
it
was
cost
something
in
the
neighborhood
of
$16
million.
now,
the
problem
with
that
estimate,
your
honor,
is
that
it
assumes
that
every
person
who
is
terminated
in
an
effort
to
gain
an
unwarranted
payments
would
demand
a
hearing
and
experience
under
goldberg
in
the
welfare
context
does
not
bear
that
out
at
all.
less
than
10%
of
the
district
of
columbia
persons
who
are
cut-off
from
welfare
are
now
demanding
hearing.
government
also
assumes
that
the
government
would
prevail
with
every
one
of
these
hearings.
every
one
of
them
and
that
there
would
therefore
be
improper
payments
in
every
case.
in
fact,
again
it
is
losing
more
of
these
cases
than
it
is
winning.
we
have
recomputed
those
figures
on
the
basis
of
government
statistics
and
the
cost
would
be
considerably
less
than
one
million
dollars
even
assuming
twice
as
many
recipients
sought
a
hearing
as
now
seeking
a
post
termination
hearing.
even
assuming
that
the
government
had
no
power
to
collect
any
over-payments
it
might
make
and
it
has
substantial
statutory
power
to
collect
over-payments
in
the
disability
context
unlike
the
welfare
context
where
the
government
has
no
power
to
collect
over-payments
and
even
assuming
that
this
hearing
would
require
a
full
two
months
over
and
above
the
paper
hearing
that
the
government
has
now
--
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
we
have
computed
this
on
the
basis
your
honor
as
the
government
had
computed
it
on
the
basis
of
payments
that
would
be
made
to
recipients
in
the
interim
as
distinguished
from
undertaking
any
computation
--
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
no.
that
figure
i
have
just
given
you
is
for
the
entire
country.
there
are
some
37,000
cessations
a
year
in
this
area,
something
in
the
neighborhood
of
4,000
recipients
have
been
seeking
hearings.
i
computed
that
on
the
basis
of
the
entire
country.
what
i
have
not
undertaken
--
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
it
would
be
considerably
less
than
million
dollars.
what
i
want
to
make
clear
is
that
we
have
not
undertaken
to
compute
the
cost
to
the
government
of
operating
this
machinery.
we
are
trying
to
figure
out
how
many,
how
much
money
would
be
expended
in
making
payments
which
might
be
determined
after
the
hearing
--
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
that
is
right.
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
the
government
did
not
undertake
that
show
it
needed.
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
that
is
right.
the
point
(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
i
am
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
point
that
illustrates
is
that
the
welfare
program
where
prior
hearings
were
held
acquired
towards
the
size
of
the
disability
program,
both
in
the
numbers
of
recipients
and
the
numbers
of
cessation.
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
to
some
extent,
your
honor.
there
is
no
half-way
disability
in
this
program.
it
is
all
(voice
overlap)
that
there
is
no
partial
disability.
and
the
insurance
programs
generally
have
attempted
to
use
a
more
objective
standard
to
determine
disability.
they
use
schedules,
person
qualifies
under
schedule
will
actuall
is
or
is
not
disabled.
the
government
in
this
program
has
undertaken
a
quite
more
elaborate
scheme.
this
program
is
to
be
based
on
the
individual
facts
of
each
individual
case
as
the
regulations
make
clear.
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
in
the
event
they
determined
what?
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
i
would
take
it
that
would
be
a
factor
that
the
insurance
company
would
take
into
account
(voice
overlap)
take
an
inquiry.
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
one
would
hope
that
an
insurance
company
would
do
more
than
that.
it
would
undertake
an
inquiry
to
determine
that
fact.
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
your
honor,
i
am
trying
to
make
two
points
in
response
to
that.
one
is
that
the
insurance
disability
program
used,
were
used
considerably
more
objective
standard
disability
than
the
federal
program.
the
other
is
that
one
would
assume
that
an
insurance
company
would
apply
its
standards
fairly
and
if
that
standards
requires,
as
federal
regulations
do
in
the
disability
area
that
a
thorough
inquiry
into
all
the
facts
be
made,
the
termination
not
be
based
on
any
easy
litmus
test,
termination
not
be
based
solely
on
earnings
as
the
regulation
say,
not
be
based
solely
on
a
doctor’s
report,
which
the
regulation
say.
if
an
insurance
company
--
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
the
--
the
question
of
whether
disability
continues
--
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
some
of
the
cases,
your
honor.
more
of
the
cases
are
so
called
medical
cessations.
government
has
a
doctor’s
report
--
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
that
was
an
earnings
case.
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
no.
the
regulations
make
that
a
question
of
fact.
they
say
that
the
mere
fact
that
a
recipient
has
earned
money
is
not
the
end
of
the
inquiry,
but
the
beginning
of
it.
he
has
an
opportunity
to
share
how
he
performed
whether
he
was
able
to
continue.
in
mr.
wright’s
case
he
was
not.
he
undertook
the
work
and
could
not
continue.
he
had
to
stop.
regulations
say
that
is
the
kind
of
inquiry
that
should
be
undertaken
and
that
is
the
kind
of
inquiry
that
is
undertaken
at
the
end
of
the
road
and
a
post
termination
hearing
is
now
required
as
a
matter
of
statutory
right.
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
that
is
right.
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
that
is
right
and
he
undertook
the
hearing,
he
asked
for
a
hearing
at
that
point.
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
well.
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
that
is
right.
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
yes.
but
he
would
not
have
protections
provided
in
goldberg,
a
chance
to
meet
the
decision
maker
face
to
face,
to
demonstrate
his
disability,
to
show
it,
tell
his
story,
to
cross-examine.
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
had
an
interview
with
the
claims
representative
and
the
government
says
in
its
brief
is
not
qualified
to
make
the
judgments
of
medical
disability.
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
that
is
right.
i
am
not
disputing
that,
mr.
justice
white.
i
am
saying
is
that
questions
arise
in
this
context
to
inherently
complicate
his
objective.
that
is
what
the
legislative
history
says.
that
is
what
the
regulation
say.
the
55%
reversal
rate
which
arises
only
on
the
basis
of
terminations
on
the
basis
of
either
medical
evidence
or
employers
report
is
eloquent
testimony
that
these
are
tough
fact
questions.
indeed,
in
some
respects
they
are
the
identical
fact
questions
that
arise
in
the
welfare
context
because
this
court
has
required
prior
hearings
under
welfare
disability
programs
that
raise
precise
same
issues
as
it
raised
in
these
cases.
we
say
that
goldberg
rules
this
case.
the
same
kind
of
tough
complex
fact
issues,
the
same
kind
of
pressing
interest
in
receiving
benefits.
no
basis
in
the
social
security
act
which
governs
both
disability
and
welfare
to
distinguish
goldberg
in
this
case.
in
fact,
the
government
has
recognized
the
close
connection
between
the
two.
it
argued
in
its
brief
in
the
goldberg
case
to
this
court
that
it
would
be
inconsistent
to
provide
hearings
in
a
welfare
context
and
not
in
the
disability
context.
they
went
on
to
say
the
disability
case
was
the
a
fortiori
case
because
the
disability
recipient
has
a
mandatory
condition
of
his
entitlement,
must
have
contributed
substantial
funds
for
a
protracted
period,
precise
funds
from
which
he
proposes
to
draw
his
benefits.
it
is
not
true
with
the
welfare
context.
as
this
court
said
in
flemming
and
nestor,
in
that
sense
social
security
benefits
are
earned,
a
functioning
member
of
the
economy
ought
to
be
able
to
draw
upon
that
economy
when
they
are
protected
against
the
--
taken
place.
we
think
it
would
be
intolerable
to
distinguish
the
disability
case
and
the
welfare
case.
that
would
create
the
anomalous
result.
a
man
who
has
contributed
his
money
over
the
years
and
worked
would
have
fewer
procedural
protections
than
the
welfare
recipient
who
is
not
required
to
contribute
to
a
fund.
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
well,
i
think
there
is
--
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
well,
i
think
the
same
as
--
i
would
say
the
answer
comes
out
the
same
way.
if
one
buys
a
permanent
disability
protection
policy
which
i
happen
to
have
now.
i
paid
my
money
for
five
years.
if
i
become
disabled
tomorrow,
i
am
entitled
as
a
matter
of
contract
law,
the
benefits,
i
paid
my
money,
i
have
earned
it.
i
cannot
turn
around
and
say,
oh!
no.
we
do
not
think
we
should
be
paying
those
moneys.
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
i
go
to
court
to
enforce
my
contract
and
of
course
we
all
recognize
that
the
fact
that
we
are
talking
about,
the
federal
government
administering
a
major
federal
program
for
the
general
welfare
of
the
people
and
that
is
in
a
poor
distinction
(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
that
is
right.
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
that
is
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
is
that
i
would
awfully
important
a
distinction,
but
the
analogy
between
insurance
and
a
disability
recipient’s
right
to
claim
benefits
when
the
protected
against
when
the
claim
transpires,
these
are
very
close
one.
one
other
reason
we
think
that
it
would
be
intolerable
to
distinguish
goldberg
in
this
case
is
that
the
upshot
would
be
that
the
states
which
administer
the
welfare
program
would
be
upheld
to
a
higher
procedural
due
process
requirement
under
the
federal
constitution
then
with
the
federal
government
which
administers
the
social
security
program.
i
want
to
say
one
final
word
about
the
relief
we
seek
in
this
court.
that
the
court
can
either
do
two
things.
it
can
remand
to
lower
court
to
enjoin
further
terminations
without
affording
the
preliminary
hearings,
satisfying
goldberg
and
kelly
standards.
the
character
of
the
government’s
argument
has
suggested
an
alternative
approach.
the
government
now
does
concede
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
exception
in
the
act
which
permits
summary
termination.
now,
admitting
the
unconstitutional,
unconstitutionality
of
that
provision
leaves
that
stand
in
standing.
only
the
general
requirement
in
the
act
that
an
oral
hearing
must
precede
final
agency
action,
that
is
set
forth
in
sections
405
and
421,
section
1303
of
the
act
is
the
severability
provision
which
says
if
one
provision
is
declared
unconstitutional
the
rest
of
the
act
remains
standing.
what
this
would
mean
would
be
that
the
general
requirement
would
have
take
oral
hearings
which
are
now
statutorily
required
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
would
have
to
be
held
before
disability
benefits
could
be
terminated.
this
in
effect
gives
the
matter
back
to
congress
and
it
says
the
summary
suspension
that
you
have
undertaken
will
not
satisfy
the
recent
teachings
of
this
court.
we
declare
that
section
unconstitutional.
congress
at
that
point
either
leaves
the
existing
oral
hearings
as
they
are
and
order
them
to
speed
it
up.
congress
on
the
other
hand
may
decide
that
it
does
want
to
have
some
sort
of
a
preliminary
determination
before
the
full
scale
apa
hearing
and
it
may
decide
that
it
wants
to
institute
a
goldberg
and
kelly
type
oral
hearing
which
meets
just
the
rudimentary
requirements
of
due
process.
this
we
think
should
more
appropriate
be
--
appropriately
be
determined
by
the
congress
rather
than
the
government
in
their
brief
which
has
undertaken
at
13th
hour
in
this
case
to
rewrite
a
summary
suspension
provision
into
the
act
of
congress.
the
essence
of
our
case
is
that
as
the
court
said
in
perales,
the
social
security
system
must
be
fair.
we
do
not
think
procedures
which
fall
short
of
the
goldberg
and
kelly
standards
can
be
said
to
be
fair.
we
would
urge
this
court
to
make
it
clear
that
those
standards
obtained
in
this
area
as
well
as
in
other
areas.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
here
representing
several
named
individuals
in
the
class
of
disability
recipients.
the
government’s
presentation
has
made
clear
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
complicated
statutory
scheme.
that
should
not
obscure
the
fact
that
the
legal
issues
in
this
case
are
uncomplicated,
had
been
considerably
narrowed
in
this
court.
when
this
case
begun
nearly
two
years
ago,
the
government
was
arguing
that
the
provision
in
the
statute
authorizing
summary
suspension
of
disability
payments
was
constitutional.
now,
judges
gasch,
robb
and
matthews
disagreed.
the
government
has
abandoned
that
contention
and
this
court
it
concedes
that
that
statutory
section
is
unconstitutional
and
it
concedes
that
there
is
a
right
to
an
opportunity
to
a
hearing
before
disability
benefits
are
terminated.
now,
these
are
the
propositions
that
we
had
been
attempting
to
establish
in
this
case.
we
had
assumed
that
once
they
were
recognized
that
would
obviate
the
necessity
for
action
by
this
court
and
that
has
not
proved
to
be
the
case
because
in
this
court,
the
government
contends
that
the
right
to
a
hearing
it
would
provide
means
a
paper
hearing
and
calls
a
hearing
on
paper.
by
this,
the
government
says
it
would
provide
notice
if
it
found
conflicting
evidence.
it
would
provide
a
brief
summary
of
evidence
adverse
to
the
recipient,
providing
opportunity
to
file
his
paper.
it
would
not
under
any
circumstances,
regardless,
whether
or
not
conflicting
evidence
of
continuing
disability
existed.
it
would
not
provide
opportunity
for
an
oral
proceeding
of
any
kind,
would
not
assure
decision
by
an
impartial
decision
maker.
the
government’s
basic
position
is
that
these
latter
procedural
protections
are
unnecessary
because
the
decisions
in
this
area,
uniquely
objective
and
reliable,
as
mr.
gray
just
said,
the
government
bends
over
backwards
to
assure
that
recipients
may
stay
on
the
roles.
there
is
one
overwhelming
statistic
which
demonstrates
the
difficulty
the
government
has
in
sustaining
that
position.
present
time,
hearings
are
required
as
a
matter
of
statutory
right
after
termination,
many
months
down
the
road.
in
those
cases,
paper
determinations
that
disability
has
ceased
are
reversed
in
55%
of
the
cases.
more
times
than
not,
when
the
recipient
gets
to
the
hearing
has
an
opportunity
to
tell
his
the
story,
present
affirmative
evidence,
cross-examine
would
prevail.
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
yes,
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
that
is
right
your
honor.
the
statute
requires
that.
the
problem
of
course
during
many
months
--
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
the
statistics
in
the
record,
somewhere
between
four
and
six
months.
different
statistics
had
been
supplied
from
one
time
to
another.
they
are
all
set
out
in
the
briefs.
considerable
period
is
consumed
while
the
recipient
is
cut-off
from
payments.
once
he
gets
to
that
hearing,
more
times
than
not,
he
prevails.
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
that
is
my
understanding
on
the
basis
of
--
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
something
to
three
or
four
months
beyond
the
paper
--
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
that
is
right.
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
that
is
right,
just
as
was
the
case
in
the
welfare
area,
precisely
the
same.
and
we
think
that
that
55%
statistic
is
more
eloquent
than
pages
of
testimony
to
demonstrate
the
importance
of
the
protections
we
seek
and
the
inadequacy
of
the
procedures
that
are
now
followed
or
that
would
be
followed
under
the
protections
the
government
has
now
undertaken
to
provide.
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
your
honor,
we
take
from
goldberg
the
language
that
the
court
in
that
case
was
undertaking
to
prescribe
the
minimum,
what
it
called
the
rudimentary
bearing
up
of
due
process.
and
we
are
--
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
your
honor,
we
are
seeking
only
those
rudimentary
protections
provided
in
the
goldberg
situation.
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
yes.
the
average
recipient
receives
according
to
the
government’s
figure
something
along
the
lines
of
$200.00
a
month
and
the
government
has
undertaken
an
estimate
of
what
it
would
cost
hear
hearings,
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing
satisfying
the
goldberg
for
its
standards
and
it
is
determined
that
it
was
cost
something
in
the
neighborhood
of
$16
million.
now,
the
problem
with
that
estimate,
your
honor,
is
that
it
assumes
that
every
person
who
is
terminated
in
an
effort
to
gain
an
unwarranted
payments
would
demand
a
hearing
and
experience
under
goldberg
in
the
welfare
context
does
not
bear
that
out
at
all.
less
than
10%
of
the
district
of
columbia
persons
who
are
cut-off
from
welfare
are
now
demanding
hearing.
government
also
assumes
that
the
government
would
prevail
with
every
one
of
these
hearings.
every
one
of
them
and
that
there
would
therefore
be
improper
payments
in
every
case.
in
fact,
again
it
is
losing
more
of
these
cases
than
it
is
winning.
we
have
recomputed
those
figures
on
the
basis
of
government
statistics
and
the
cost
would
be
considerably
less
than
one
million
dollars
even
assuming
twice
as
many
recipients
sought
a
hearing
as
now
seeking
a
post
termination
hearing.
even
assuming
that
the
government
had
no
power
to
collect
any
over-payments
it
might
make
and
it
has
substantial
statutory
power
to
collect
over-payments
in
the
disability
context
unlike
the
welfare
context
where
the
government
has
no
power
to
collect
over-payments
and
even
assuming
that
this
hearing
would
require
a
full
two
months
over
and
above
the
paper
hearing
that
the
government
has
now
--
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
we
have
computed
this
on
the
basis
your
honor
as
the
government
had
computed
it
on
the
basis
of
payments
that
would
be
made
to
recipients
in
the
interim
as
distinguished
from
undertaking
any
computation
--
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
no.
that
figure
i
have
just
given
you
is
for
the
entire
country.
there
are
some
37,000
cessations
a
year
in
this
area,
something
in
the
neighborhood
of
4,000
recipients
have
been
seeking
hearings.
i
computed
that
on
the
basis
of
the
entire
country.
what
i
have
not
undertaken
--
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
it
would
be
considerably
less
than
million
dollars.
what
i
want
to
make
clear
is
that
we
have
not
undertaken
to
compute
the
cost
to
the
government
of
operating
this
machinery.
we
are
trying
to
figure
out
how
many,
how
much
money
would
be
expended
in
making
payments
which
might
be
determined
after
the
hearing
--
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
that
is
right.
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
the
government
did
not
undertake
that
show
it
needed.
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
that
is
right.
the
point
(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
i
am
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
point
that
illustrates
is
that
the
welfare
program
where
prior
hearings
were
held
acquired
towards
the
size
of
the
disability
program,
both
in
the
numbers
of
recipients
and
the
numbers
of
cessation.
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
to
some
extent,
your
honor.
there
is
no
half-way
disability
in
this
program.
it
is
all
(voice
overlap)
that
there
is
no
partial
disability.
and
the
insurance
programs
generally
have
attempted
to
use
a
more
objective
standard
to
determine
disability.
they
use
schedules,
person
qualifies
under
schedule
will
actuall
is
or
is
not
disabled.
the
government
in
this
program
has
undertaken
a
quite
more
elaborate
scheme.
this
program
is
to
be
based
on
the
individual
facts
of
each
individual
case
as
the
regulations
make
clear.
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
in
the
event
they
determined
what?
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
i
would
take
it
that
would
be
a
factor
that
the
insurance
company
would
take
into
account
(voice
overlap)
take
an
inquiry.
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
one
would
hope
that
an
insurance
company
would
do
more
than
that.
it
would
undertake
an
inquiry
to
determine
that
fact.
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
your
honor,
i
am
trying
to
make
two
points
in
response
to
that.
one
is
that
the
insurance
disability
program
used,
were
used
considerably
more
objective
standard
disability
than
the
federal
program.
the
other
is
that
one
would
assume
that
an
insurance
company
would
apply
its
standards
fairly
and
if
that
standards
requires,
as
federal
regulations
do
in
the
disability
area
that
a
thorough
inquiry
into
all
the
facts
be
made,
the
termination
not
be
based
on
any
easy
litmus
test,
termination
not
be
based
solely
on
earnings
as
the
regulation
say,
not
be
based
solely
on
a
doctor’s
report,
which
the
regulation
say.
if
an
insurance
company
--
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
the
--
the
question
of
whether
disability
continues
--
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
some
of
the
cases,
your
honor.
more
of
the
cases
are
so
called
medical
cessations.
government
has
a
doctor’s
report
--
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
that
was
an
earnings
case.
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
no.
the
regulations
make
that
a
question
of
fact.
they
say
that
the
mere
fact
that
a
recipient
has
earned
money
is
not
the
end
of
the
inquiry,
but
the
beginning
of
it.
he
has
an
opportunity
to
share
how
he
performed
whether
he
was
able
to
continue.
in
mr.
wright’s
case
he
was
not.
he
undertook
the
work
and
could
not
continue.
he
had
to
stop.
regulations
say
that
is
the
kind
of
inquiry
that
should
be
undertaken
and
that
is
the
kind
of
inquiry
that
is
undertaken
at
the
end
of
the
road
and
a
post
termination
hearing
is
now
required
as
a
matter
of
statutory
right.
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
that
is
right.
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
that
is
right
and
he
undertook
the
hearing,
he
asked
for
a
hearing
at
that
point.
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
well.
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
that
is
right.
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
yes.
but
he
would
not
have
protections
provided
in
goldberg,
a
chance
to
meet
the
decision
maker
face
to
face,
to
demonstrate
his
disability,
to
show
it,
tell
his
story,
to
cross-examine.
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
had
an
interview
with
the
claims
representative
and
the
government
says
in
its
brief
is
not
qualified
to
make
the
judgments
of
medical
disability.
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
that
is
right.
i
am
not
disputing
that,
mr.
justice
white.
i
am
saying
is
that
questions
arise
in
this
context
to
inherently
complicate
his
objective.
that
is
what
the
legislative
history
says.
that
is
what
the
regulation
say.
the
55%
reversal
rate
which
arises
only
on
the
basis
of
terminations
on
the
basis
of
either
medical
evidence
or
employers
report
is
eloquent
testimony
that
these
are
tough
fact
questions.
indeed,
in
some
respects
they
are
the
identical
fact
questions
that
arise
in
the
welfare
context
because
this
court
has
required
prior
hearings
under
welfare
disability
programs
that
raise
precise
same
issues
as
it
raised
in
these
cases.
we
say
that
goldberg
rules
this
case.
the
same
kind
of
tough
complex
fact
issues,
the
same
kind
of
pressing
interest
in
receiving
benefits.
no
basis
in
the
social
security
act
which
governs
both
disability
and
welfare
to
distinguish
goldberg
in
this
case.
in
fact,
the
government
has
recognized
the
close
connection
between
the
two.
it
argued
in
its
brief
in
the
goldberg
case
to
this
court
that
it
would
be
inconsistent
to
provide
hearings
in
a
welfare
context
and
not
in
the
disability
context.
they
went
on
to
say
the
disability
case
was
the
a
fortiori
case
because
the
disability
recipient
has
a
mandatory
condition
of
his
entitlement,
must
have
contributed
substantial
funds
for
a
protracted
period,
precise
funds
from
which
he
proposes
to
draw
his
benefits.
it
is
not
true
with
the
welfare
context.
as
this
court
said
in
flemming
and
nestor,
in
that
sense
social
security
benefits
are
earned,
a
functioning
member
of
the
economy
ought
to
be
able
to
draw
upon
that
economy
when
they
are
protected
against
the
--
taken
place.
we
think
it
would
be
intolerable
to
distinguish
the
disability
case
and
the
welfare
case.
that
would
create
the
anomalous
result.
a
man
who
has
contributed
his
money
over
the
years
and
worked
would
have
fewer
procedural
protections
than
the
welfare
recipient
who
is
not
required
to
contribute
to
a
fund.
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
well,
i
think
there
is
--
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
well,
i
think
the
same
as
--
i
would
say
the
answer
comes
out
the
same
way.
if
one
buys
a
permanent
disability
protection
policy
which
i
happen
to
have
now.
i
paid
my
money
for
five
years.
if
i
become
disabled
tomorrow,
i
am
entitled
as
a
matter
of
contract
law,
the
benefits,
i
paid
my
money,
i
have
earned
it.
i
cannot
turn
around
and
say,
oh!
no.
we
do
not
think
we
should
be
paying
those
moneys.
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
i
go
to
court
to
enforce
my
contract
and
of
course
we
all
recognize
that
the
fact
that
we
are
talking
about,
the
federal
government
administering
a
major
federal
program
for
the
general
welfare
of
the
people
and
that
is
in
a
poor
distinction
(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
that
is
right.
mr.
robert
n.
sayler
that
is
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
is
that
i
would
awfully
important
a
distinction,
but
the
analogy
between
insurance
and
a
disability
recipient’s
right
to
claim
benefits
when
the
protected
against
when
the
claim
transpires,
these
are
very
close
one.
one
other
reason
we
think
that
it
would
be
intolerable
to
distinguish
goldberg
in
this
case
is
that
the
upshot
would
be
that
the
states
which
administer
the
welfare
program
would
be
upheld
to
a
higher
procedural
due
process
requirement
under
the
federal
constitution
then
with
the
federal
government
which
administers
the
social
security
program.
i
want
to
say
one
final
word
about
the
relief
we
seek
in
this
court.
that
the
court
can
either
do
two
things.
it
can
remand
to
lower
court
to
enjoin
further
terminations
without
affording
the
preliminary
hearings,
satisfying
goldberg
and
kelly
standards.
the
character
of
the
government’s
argument
has
suggested
an
alternative
approach.
the
government
now
does
concede
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
exception
in
the
act
which
permits
summary
termination.
now,
admitting
the
unconstitutional,
unconstitutionality
of
that
provision
leaves
that
stand
in
standing.
only
the
general
requirement
in
the
act
that
an
oral
hearing
must
precede
final
agency
action,
that
is
set
forth
in
sections
405
and
421,
section
1303
of
the
act
is
the
severability
provision
which
says
if
one
provision
is
declared
unconstitutional
the
rest
of
the
act
remains
standing.
what
this
would
mean
would
be
that
the
general
requirement
would
have
take
oral
hearings
which
are
now
statutorily
required
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
would
have
to
be
held
before
disability
benefits
could
be
terminated.
this
in
effect
gives
the
matter
back
to
congress
and
it
says
the
summary
suspension
that
you
have
undertaken
will
not
satisfy
the
recent
teachings
of
this
court.
we
declare
that
section
unconstitutional.
congress
at
that
point
either
leaves
the
existing
oral
hearings
as
they
are
and
order
them
to
speed
it
up.
congress
on
the
other
hand
may
decide
that
it
does
want
to
have
some
sort
of
a
preliminary
determination
before
the
full
scale
apa
hearing
and
it
may
decide
that
it
wants
to
institute
a
goldberg
and
kelly
type
oral
hearing
which
meets
just
the
rudimentary
requirements
of
due
process.
this
we
think
should
more
appropriate
be
--
appropriately
be
determined
by
the
congress
rather
than
the
government
in
their
brief
which
has
undertaken
at
13th
hour
in
this
case
to
rewrite
a
summary
suspension
provision
into
the
act
of
congress.
the
essence
of
our
case
is
that
as
the
court
said
in
perales,
the
social
security
system
must
be
fair.
we
do
not
think
procedures
which
fall
short
of
the
goldberg
and
kelly
standards
can
be
said
to
be
fair.
we
would
urge
this
court
to
make
it
clear
that
those
standards
obtained
in
this
area
as
well
as
in
other
areas.
thank
you.
