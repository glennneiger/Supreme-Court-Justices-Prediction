mr.
richard
b.
stone
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
government’s
view,
this
case
raises
essentially
two
questions.
one,
whether
petitioner’s
eligibility
for
citizenship
is
in
fact
governed
by
the
selective
service
act
of
1948
or
by
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952
and,
two,
assuming
that
the
1952
act
applies,
whether
petitioner
is
nonetheless
eligible
for
united
states
citizenship
now
by
virtue
of
his
having
apply
for
and
obtain
an
alien’s
exemption
from
the
draft
in
1950.
i
think
both
of
these
questions
raise
rather
related
and
difficult
issues
of
statutory
interpretation
of
the
1952
act
and,
without
reiterating
material
that
has
already
been
gone
over
or
that
is
familiar
to
this
court,
i
think
it
might
be
helpful
right
now
if
i
very
briefly
place
the
1952
statute
in
its
context.
under
the
selective
service
act
of
1948,
as
under
the
predecessor
statute
of
1940,
an
alien
who
applied
for
exemption
from
the
draft
on
grounds
of
alienage
was
thereby
permanently
debarred
from
seeking
citizenship.
thus,
when
petitioner
asked
to
have
sought
and
obtained
an
alien’s
exemption
shortly
before
his
scheduled
induction
in
1950
after
having
passed
the
physical
examination
for
the
draft,
the
sole
test
in
the
military
service
area
of
an
alien’s
eligibility
for
united
states
citizenship
was
in
fact
whether
that
alien
had
submitted
a
valid
application
for
an
exemption
on
grounds
of
alienage.
now,
i
take
it
that
all
agree
that
if
the
1948
act
is
applicable
to
this
case,
mr.
astrup
is
clearly
ineligible
for
citizenship
and
i
guess
there
can
be
no
dispute
of
this
point.
in
view
of
this
court’s
holding
in
ceballos
v.
shaughnessy
in
which
a
unanimous
court
and
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
brennan
held
that,
under
the
1948
act,
an
alien--
exempt
alien
who
subsequently
loses
his
exemption,
but
like
the
petitioner
here
fails
to
pass
a
physical
examination,
continues
to
be
ineligible
for
citizenship.
well
then
in
june
of
1951,
as
the
korean
war
grew
in
intensity,
congress
did
what
it
had
done
several
times
before
during
war
time.
it
put
increasing
pressure
on
aliens
residing
in
the
united
states
to
participate
in
the
war
effort.
in
the
case
of
permanent
resident
aliens,
such
as
petitioner,
congress
simply
amended
the
selective
service
act
of
1948
to
provide
that
permanent
resident
aliens
were
no
longer
eligible
for
draft
exemptions
on
grounds
of
alienage,
and
this
law
affected
both
those
aliens
who
had
already
sought
and
obtained
alien’s
exemptions
and
those
who
had
not
done
so.
but,
what
about
the
citizenship
status
of
those
aliens
who
had
in
fact
obtained
alien’s
exemptions
which
were
no
longer
valid
and
who
were
now
eligible
theoretically,
at
least
with
respect
to
their
alienage,
to
be
called
for
military
service?
it
certainly
would
have
been
possible,
though
by
no
means
necessary,
for
congress
to
have
provided
in
the
1951
amendment
for
some
sort
of
adjustment
to
the
ineligibility
for
citizenship
of
those
persons
like
petitioner
who
were
no
longer
exempt
by
virtue
of
that
amendment.
and
i
guess,
in
any
event,
it
would’ve
been
logical
for
congress
to
have
said
something,
one
way
or
the
other,
in
the
1950
statute
directly
about
the
citizenship
eligibility
of
those
persons
whose
exemptions
had
been
taken
away
by
that
statute.
but,
congress
said
nothing,
that
is
nothing
more
than
that
permanent
resident
aliens
were
no
longer
exempt
by
virtue
of
their
alienage,
and
i
take
it
also
that
one
day
after
that
statute
became
effective
and
for
at
least
the
next
year-and-a
half
until
the
effective
date
of
the
1952
immigration
and
nationality
act,
no
one
doubted
that
the
selective
service
act
of
1948
continued
to
govern
the
citizenship
eligibility
of
those
persons
like
petitioner
and
that,
consequently
those
who
had
applied
for
alien’s
exemptions
continue
to
be
debarred
from
seeking
citizenship.
then
finally,
in
1952,
congress
passed
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952
which
is
the
statute
that
gives
rise
to
the
problems
of
this
case
and
which,
for
the
first
time,
incorporated
the
rules
governing
citizenship
eligibility
of
aliens
in
a
context
other
than
the
selective
service
act,
that
is,
the
citizenship
eligibility
in
its
relationship
to
military
service.
now,
as
we
know,
the
1952
act
set
out
a
somewhat
different
test
of
citizenship
eligibility.
in
the
words
of
this
court
in
ceballos
v.
shaughnessy,
a
two-pronged
test
and
that
is
the
formulation
that
has
been
used
ever
since
though
it
has
never
been
clearly
elaborated
what
exactly
that
test
meant.
and,
by
that
two-pronged
test,
an
alien
was
debarred
from
seeking
citizenship
if
he
both
applied
for
an
alien’s
exemption
and
“is
or
was
relieved
from
service
on
such
ground.”
now,
again,
it
would
certainly
been
possible
for
congress
at
that
time
to
have
settled
the
question
of
citizenship
eligibility
for
those
whose
exemptions
had
been
removed
by
the
1951
amendment
by
specifying
that
the
two-pronged
test
set
out
in
the
1950
act
would
be
applied
to
those
persons.
but,
again,
congress
did
not
specifically
referred
at
all
to
that
class
of
persons,
like
petitioner,
who
had
applied
for
alien’s
exemptions
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
1952
act--
of
the
1951
amendment
that
took
that
exemption
away.
instead,
what
congress
did
was
to
put
a
savings
clause
in
the
1952
act
which
is
section
405
(a)
of
the
act.
printed
now
is
a
note
to
8
usc
1101
which
said
that
“unless
otherwise
specifically
provided,”
all
preexisting
conditions,
rights,
acts,
things,
liabilities,
obligations,
or
matters
arising
under
prior
law
shall
continue
in
effect.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that--
i
want
to
get
to
that,
mr.
justice
white.
that
is
a
somewhat
difficult
question
to
answer
precisely.
if
we
take
the
assumption
that
is--
that
applies
or
has
applied,
it
must
be
parsed
word
for
word,
then
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
think
of
anyone
who,
at
the
time
the
1952
act
was
enacted,
had
already
applied,
we
would
not
come
under
the
rule
in
this
case,
but
this
court
in--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
would
be
s--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
would
be
subject--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that’s
right,
and--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that’s
right,
to
the--
it
would--
and
there
was
still
a
considerable
class
of
aliens
to
whom
it
would--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
think
it
is
not
unusual
for
congress
to
place
a
statute
like
that
both
in
the
present
and
the
past
tense
simply
to
be
all
inclusive
and
to
make
it
unambiguous
that
it’s
all
inclusive
at
any
time
that
it’s
read.
i
think
there’s
an
implication
that
it
means
to
be
retroactive
with
the
respect--
with
respect
to
the
time
that
it’s
enacted,
but
it
isn’t
necessarily
so
and,
in
ceballos
v.
shaughnessy,
this
question
was
raised
and
this
court
did,
indeed,
specifically
say
that
the
savings
clause
was
preserved
intact
and
that
the
general
language
is
or
has
applied
did
not
apply
to
the
petitioner
in
ceballos
v.
shaughnessy
who
is
in
an
identical
position,
as
i
shall
shortly
elaborate,
to
the
petitioner
here.
the
scheme
is
that,
unless
it
is
otherwise
specifically
provided,
petitioner
is
debarred
from
citizenship
arising
under
the
selective
service
act
of
1948
and
that,
of
course,
that
debarment
is
clearly
a
preexisting
liability
under
section
405
(a)
of
the
act.
it
simply
continues
in
effect
and
is
unaffected
by
the
test
set
out
in
section
315,
and
this
court
has
held
that
the
savings
clause
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
a
very
broad
inclusive
clause
which
has
gotten
around
only
with
great
difficulty.
in
fact,
as
mr.
justice
clark
described
section
405
(a)
in
the
menasche
case
at
348
us,
in
which
this
court
very
carefully
examined
the
history
of
the
savings
clause
is
contained
in
the
immigration
act,
and
now
i’m
quoting
from
348
us
535.
“the
consistent
broadening
of
the
savings
provision,
particularly
in
its
general
terminology,
indicates
that
this
policy
of
preservation
was
intended
to
apply
to
matters
both
within
and
without
the
specific
contemplation
of
congress.
and,
the
implication
of
that
menasche
case
seems
to
be
quite
clearly
that
the
savings
clause
of
section
405
(a)
is
applicable
unless
congress
makes
a
deliberate
and
specific
statement
of
its
intention
to
eliminate
a
preexisting
right
or
liability,
and
congress
did
not
do
that
in
section
315
in
our
view.
appropriately,
for
our
purposes
here,
what
congress
did
was
to
say
that
the
section
315
shall
apply
notwithstanding
the
provisions
of
section
405
(b).
section
405
(b)
is
also
a
savings
clause
contained
in
the
1952
act
and
it
is
significant
to
us,
though
not
necessarily
dispositive
in
light
of
other
overwhelming
evidence
as
this
court
held
in
shomberg,
that
section
315
(a)
does
specifically
accept
405
(b)
but
not
405
(a).
with
respect
to
405
(a),
we
have
only
the
general
language
of
section
315
which
covers
an
alien
who
applies
or
has
applied
for
an
alien’s
exemption
and
i
think
that
the
ceballos
case
really
closes
considering
that
clause
sufficiently,
in
general
language,
to
override
the
savings
clause.
as
i
say,
the
petitioner
in
ceballos
and
shaughnessy
was
virtually
in
a
position
virtually
identical
to
that
of
petitioner
for
these
purposes.
he
had
filed
his
application
for
exemption
before
the
date
of
the
1952
act.
the
only
difference
here
is
that,
in
ceballos,
the
procedural
posture
of
the
case
was
slightly
different.
it
involved
a
review
of
an
order
of
deportation
rather
than
a
naturalization
petition,
so
that
another
clause
of
section
405
(a)
involving
proceedings
to
suspend
deportation
was
brought
into
play.
but,
the
crucial
issue
in
ceballos,
as
here,
was
the
citizenship
eligibility
of
an
alien
who
applied
for
an
exemption,
was
later
exposed
to
the
draft,
and
was
subsequently
found
physically
unfit
for
the
service.
and,
the
court
found
that
the
general
language
of
section
315
was
simply
not
a
specific
exemption
to
the
savings
clause
of
section
405
(a).
now,
on
the
assumption
that
section
315
of
the
1952
act
does
redefine
the
citizenship
eligibility
of
petitioner
and
others
in
his
situation,
in
what
way--
the
question
is
now,
in
what
way
does
that
statute,
that
is
the
1952
act,
change
petitioner’s
eligibility
for
citizenship?
the
committee
report
of
the
senate
committee
on
the
judiciary
which
made
a
comprehensive
preliminary
study
of
the
many
provisions
of
the
1952
act
makes
very
little
reference
to
section
315
and,
what
little
there
is,
implies
to
us
that
the
committee
thought
it
was
incorporating
the
ineligibility
test
set
forth
in
the
prior
selective
service
laws.
i
guess
that
language
can’t
have
very
strong
effect
because,
after
all,
the
language
of
section
315,
as
this
court
has
held,
does
make
a
significant
addition
to
the
test
of
ineligibility
7in
that
it
requires
that
an
alien
both
apply
for
an
exemption
and
that
he’d
be
“relieved
from
service
on
such
ground,”
that
is
on--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no,
they
don’t.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
they
don’t,
mr.
justice
marshall.
they’re
not
affected
by
this
because
we
don’t
draft--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
i
assume
that--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
as
a
matter
of
practice.
i
assume
that
no
court
would
interpret
that
to
include
women
since
united
states--
the
idea,
after
all,
the
statute
is
that
aliens,
in
order
to
obtain
citizenship,
should
subject
themselves
to
the
burdens
of
american
citizens
and
american
female
citizens,
at
this
point
and
time,
don’t
have
the
burden
of
military
service.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
that’s
right.
this
is
what
we
consider
to
be
the
essential
result
of
the
language
of
section
315
in
several
courts
of
appeal
and
as
the
government
now
agrees,
aliens
who
are
subsequently
drafted
under
section
315
and
actually
served
in
the
armed
forces
are
no
longer
ineligible
for
citizenship.
in
other
words,
“relieved
from
service”
means
effectively
and
permanently
relieved
from
service,
but--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
it’s
the
second,
third,
and
ninth
circuits.
yes,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
think
that
i--
the
government
had--
did
argue
those
cases
and
contest
those
cases.
i
think
it
now
agrees
with
the
position
taken.
i
think
it
is
a
somewhat--
in
the
statutory
language,
it’s
somewhat
a
difficult
position,
but
it’s
so--
i
suppose
it
seems
repugnant
to
many
that
those
who
actually
end
up
serving
and
incurring
that
obligation
and
performing
the
duty
of
military
service
were--
really
should
be
relieved
from
their
initial
choice.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
i
think,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
that
that
is
on
the
surface
when
you
first
think
about
it,
rather
troublesome,
and
it
did--
we
do
find
that
there
are
aspects
of
our
application
of
3--
section
315
that
are
somewhat
harsh,
as
i--
we’ve
pointed
out
in
our
brief
and
as
i
want
to
get
to,
but
i
don’t
think
it’s
that
specific
aspect
because
i--
if
you
think
about
it,
what
is--
after
all,
what
is
at
stake
here
is
service.
the
distinction
made
is
with
respect
to
whether
an
alien
has
or
has
not
served,
and
if
he
has
not
served
he
can’t
get
out
of
his
initial
choice
regardless
of
what
the--
what
ground
ultimately
relieved
him
when
he
lost
his
exemption.
the
fact
that
it
is
his
failure
to
pass
the
physical
examination
which
ultimately
leads
to
his
not
serving
on
the
second--
on
his
second
chance
is
really
an
incidental
aspect
of
the
fact
that
we
make
actual
service
of
the
test.
once
a
person
has
declared
that
he’s
an
alien
and
wants
to
avail
himself
of
the
alien’s
exemption
and
chooses
not
to
become
a
citizen,
we
make
it--
we
make
service
the
test
and
the
fact
that
the
physical
exam
comes
in
to
play
is
a
rather
incidental
effect
of
that.
after
all,
there
are
many
benefits
which
congress
has
conferred
upon
veterans
and
people
who
have
served
in
the
armed
forces
that
it
doesn’t
bestow
upon
american
citizens
who
wanted
to
serve
but
were
unable
to
do
so,
ineligible
to
do
so
for
one
reason
or
another,
including
failure
to
pass
a
physical
examination.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
in
all
those
cases,
mr.
justice
white,
it
has
been
stipulated,
and
i’m
afraid
the
government
has
not
been
totally
consistent
after
the--
in
the
aftermath
of
ceballos
and
shaughnessy
in
arguing
whether
the
1952
act
or
the
1948
act
apply.
it
has
been
stipulated
that
we
would
construe
this
under
the
1952
act
and
the
only
reason
i
could
really
think
of
for
this
is
that
it--
the
language
of
the
1948
act
seems
clearly
to
make
it
irrelevant
whether
a
person
served
ultimately
or
not,
but
that
position
is
just
rather
difficult
to
stomach
in
some
way.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i’d
rather
not
face
that,
but
i
suppose
we
would
make
the
same
argument
that,
under
the
1948
act,
actual
service
didn’t
matter
and,
in
one
case,
that
was
argued
and
held
that
actual
service
did
not
matter
under
the
1948
act.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that’s
right.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
suppose
he
would
be,
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
suppose
that,
under
these
cases
which
hold
that
service
itself--
well,
i--
that--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that,
actually,
if
he
were
dishonorably
discharged,
actually
i
suppose
it
could
be
argued
depending
on
what
time
it
was
in
his
service.
it
could
be
argued
that
he
had
not--
that
he
had
been
effectively
relieved
because
he
hadn’t
really
served.
he
had--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
he
was
theoretically
subject
to
the
draft.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
he
took
the
physical.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
and,
unlike
the
first
time
he
took
the
physical--
he
failed
it,
yes.
now,
let
me
just
elaborate--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that
theory
is
not
involved
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
and
we
haven’t
argued
that
position
with
respect
to
the
1948
statute.
we’ve
asked
in
the
opinions
with
respect
to
the
1952
statute,
but
i
suppose,
theoretically,
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes.
now,
i
think
it
is
very
important
to
see
exactly
what
language
we’re
dealing
with
in
terms
of
this
distinction
between
a
person
who
has
physically--
who
has
been
relieved
from
physical
service
and
a
person
who
has
actually
served.
petitioner
proposes
that
even
though
an
alien
who
applies
for
an
exemption
on
grounds
of
alienage
is
effectively
and
permanently
relieved
from
service,
that
is
he
never
serves
in
the
armed
forces.
he
is
not
ineligible
for
citizenship
if
any
other
ground
for
exemption
ultimately
comes
into
play
and
contributes
in
any
way
that
he’s
permanently
relieved
from
service.
in
other
words,
though
he
doesn’t
explicitly
say
this,
he
would
read
the
phrase
“relieved
from
service
on
such
ground”
as
meaning
relieved
from
service
exclusively
on
grounds
of
alienage.
this
would’ve
been,
of
course,
a
rather
radical
departure
from
the
1948
statute
which,
arguably,
wouldn’t
even
have
saved
him
if
he
had
served,
but
congress
certainly
could’ve
chosen
to
adopt
this
more
generous
position
and
to
relieve
from
the
consequences
of
their
initial
choice
not
to
become
citizens
all
citizens
who
applied
for
exemptions
but
were
later
exposed
to
theoretical
liability
for
the
draft.
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
it
may
be
considered
somewhat
harsh,
in
fact,
that
congress
did
not
do
so,
though
not
for
the
reasons
suggested
by
petitioner
that
the
distinction
is
one
of
passing
a
physical
examination
because
we
consider
that
quite
incidental.
but,
we
do
feel
that
there
is,
perhaps,
something
harsh
in
the
fact
that
petitioner
did,
after
all,
originally
make
his
election
not
to
serve
in
the
armed
forces
and
not
to
become
a
citizen
on
the
assumption
that
he
would
continue
to
enjoy
the
assurance
of
an
alien’s
exemption
from
the
draft
and
he
was,
by
no
means,
entitled
to
presume
that
congress
would
not--
was
foreclosed
from
removing
his
exemption.
there’s
no
evidence
that
anyone
told
him
congress
was
so
foreclosed
but,
nonetheless,
he
probably
did
assume,
vaguely
or
otherwise,
that
because
of
his
alienage
he
would
not
have
to
think
about
liability
for
military
service
anymore.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
guess
he
would
have
assumed
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
he
would
assume
that
he
would
stay
in
the
same
condition
he
was
in
prior
to
1952.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
and,
for
that
reason,
we
consider
petitioner
in
a
much
less
harsh
application
of
the
statute
than,
perhaps,
others
similarly
situated
of
who
might
not
have
had
a
change
in
their
physical
status
between
the
time
that
they
sought
the
first
exemption
and
the
time
they
the
exemption--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i’m
afraid
i
don’t
quite
see
the--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that’s
right,
and--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
would
not
apply
for
an
alien’s
exemption,
that’s
precisely
the
point.
that’s
why
i
think
that
though
we
really
have
to
take
into
account
whether
congress--
since
section
315
is
not
after
all
crystal
clear
whether
congress
intended
to
hold
all
aliens
to
their
end
of
this
so-called
bargain,
arrangement,
those
certainly
with
the
contract.
i
don’t
think
that,
really,
the
harshness
of
our
interpretation
of
section
315,
such
as
it
is,
would
apply
in
a
case
where
an
alien
had
passed
his
physical
examination
originally
and
only
decided
to
chose
his
alien’s
exemption
after
the
fact
of
knowing
he
was
physically
fit
for
the
draft.
in
fact,
several
courts
of
appeals
have
made
related
arguments.
every
court
of
appeals
that
has
decided
this
precise
issue
has,
in
fact,
decided
in
the
government’s
favor
and
several
have
pointed
out,
in
connection
with
this
issue,
that
many
things
can
happen.
an
alien
can
assess
his
chances
of
getting
an
exemption
on
some
other
ground
that
would
not
debar
him
from
citizenship
before
he
chooses
to
claim
his
alien’s
exemption,
and
then
he
may
later
loose
that
exemption.
but,
in
the
interim
period,
many
things
that
could
happen
that
would
change
his
draft
status.
things
like
marriage
at
one
point,
occupational
defermance
or
illness.
any
of
those
things
can
happen
during
the
period
when
he
holds
his
exemption
from
the
draft
which
might
provide
him
with
permanent
relief
from
the
draft
that
he
would
not
have
had
but
for
his
original
choice
of
an
alien’s
exemption.
with
respect
to
this
petitioner,
even
if
this
court
were
to
take,
let’s
say,
an
intermediate
position
with
respect
to
section
315
that
the
alien
doesn’t
have
to
have
been
relieved
exclusively
on
grounds
of
alienage
but
that,
somehow,
the
government
must
show
that
alienage
was
the
substantial
or
even
the
major
factor
contributing
to
his
ultimate
relief.
petitioner
can’t
withstand
that
test
either,
i
don’t
think.
in
any
event,
we,
on
balance,
feel
that
the
language
of
section
315
is
quite
badly
strained
by
a
construction
that
his
release
from
alienage
must
rest
exclusively
on
grounds
of
alienage.
we
feel
that
a
more
normal
reading
of
that
language
which
refers
to
an
alien
who
is
or
was
relieved
from
service,
not
from
liability
but
from
service,
on
grounds
of
alienage
is
that,
as
long
as
the
alien’s
exemption
was
one
of
the
grounds
contributing
to
his
effective
and
permanent
relief
from
service,
he
has
been
relieved
on
such
ground
within
the
meaning
of
section
315.
we
think
this
reading
is
far
more
in
line
with
congress’
attitude
as
expressed
in
the
prior
legislation,
and
we
think
that
that
prior
legislation,
the
basic
concepts
of
that
legislation,
were
meant
to
be
retained
in
the
1952
act.
and,
for
that
reason,
we
ask
that
this
court
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
government’s
view,
this
case
raises
essentially
two
questions.
one,
whether
petitioner’s
eligibility
for
citizenship
is
in
fact
governed
by
the
selective
service
act
of
1948
or
by
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952
and,
two,
assuming
that
the
1952
act
applies,
whether
petitioner
is
nonetheless
eligible
for
united
states
citizenship
now
by
virtue
of
his
having
apply
for
and
obtain
an
alien’s
exemption
from
the
draft
in
1950.
i
think
both
of
these
questions
raise
rather
related
and
difficult
issues
of
statutory
interpretation
of
the
1952
act
and,
without
reiterating
material
that
has
already
been
gone
over
or
that
is
familiar
to
this
court,
i
think
it
might
be
helpful
right
now
if
i
very
briefly
place
the
1952
statute
in
its
context.
under
the
selective
service
act
of
1948,
as
under
the
predecessor
statute
of
1940,
an
alien
who
applied
for
exemption
from
the
draft
on
grounds
of
alienage
was
thereby
permanently
debarred
from
seeking
citizenship.
thus,
when
petitioner
asked
to
have
sought
and
obtained
an
alien’s
exemption
shortly
before
his
scheduled
induction
in
1950
after
having
passed
the
physical
examination
for
the
draft,
the
sole
test
in
the
military
service
area
of
an
alien’s
eligibility
for
united
states
citizenship
was
in
fact
whether
that
alien
had
submitted
a
valid
application
for
an
exemption
on
grounds
of
alienage.
now,
i
take
it
that
all
agree
that
if
the
1948
act
is
applicable
to
this
case,
mr.
astrup
is
clearly
ineligible
for
citizenship
and
i
guess
there
can
be
no
dispute
of
this
point.
in
view
of
this
court’s
holding
in
ceballos
v.
shaughnessy
in
which
a
unanimous
court
and
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
brennan
held
that,
under
the
1948
act,
an
alien--
exempt
alien
who
subsequently
loses
his
exemption,
but
like
the
petitioner
here
fails
to
pass
a
physical
examination,
continues
to
be
ineligible
for
citizenship.
well
then
in
june
of
1951,
as
the
korean
war
grew
in
intensity,
congress
did
what
it
had
done
several
times
before
during
war
time.
it
put
increasing
pressure
on
aliens
residing
in
the
united
states
to
participate
in
the
war
effort.
in
the
case
of
permanent
resident
aliens,
such
as
petitioner,
congress
simply
amended
the
selective
service
act
of
1948
to
provide
that
permanent
resident
aliens
were
no
longer
eligible
for
draft
exemptions
on
grounds
of
alienage,
and
this
law
affected
both
those
aliens
who
had
already
sought
and
obtained
alien’s
exemptions
and
those
who
had
not
done
so.
but,
what
about
the
citizenship
status
of
those
aliens
who
had
in
fact
obtained
alien’s
exemptions
which
were
no
longer
valid
and
who
were
now
eligible
theoretically,
at
least
with
respect
to
their
alienage,
to
be
called
for
military
service?
it
certainly
would
have
been
possible,
though
by
no
means
necessary,
for
congress
to
have
provided
in
the
1951
amendment
for
some
sort
of
adjustment
to
the
ineligibility
for
citizenship
of
those
persons
like
petitioner
who
were
no
longer
exempt
by
virtue
of
that
amendment.
and
i
guess,
in
any
event,
it
would’ve
been
logical
for
congress
to
have
said
something,
one
way
or
the
other,
in
the
1950
statute
directly
about
the
citizenship
eligibility
of
those
persons
whose
exemptions
had
been
taken
away
by
that
statute.
but,
congress
said
nothing,
that
is
nothing
more
than
that
permanent
resident
aliens
were
no
longer
exempt
by
virtue
of
their
alienage,
and
i
take
it
also
that
one
day
after
that
statute
became
effective
and
for
at
least
the
next
year-and-a
half
until
the
effective
date
of
the
1952
immigration
and
nationality
act,
no
one
doubted
that
the
selective
service
act
of
1948
continued
to
govern
the
citizenship
eligibility
of
those
persons
like
petitioner
and
that,
consequently
those
who
had
applied
for
alien’s
exemptions
continue
to
be
debarred
from
seeking
citizenship.
then
finally,
in
1952,
congress
passed
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952
which
is
the
statute
that
gives
rise
to
the
problems
of
this
case
and
which,
for
the
first
time,
incorporated
the
rules
governing
citizenship
eligibility
of
aliens
in
a
context
other
than
the
selective
service
act,
that
is,
the
citizenship
eligibility
in
its
relationship
to
military
service.
now,
as
we
know,
the
1952
act
set
out
a
somewhat
different
test
of
citizenship
eligibility.
in
the
words
of
this
court
in
ceballos
v.
shaughnessy,
a
two-pronged
test
and
that
is
the
formulation
that
has
been
used
ever
since
though
it
has
never
been
clearly
elaborated
what
exactly
that
test
meant.
and,
by
that
two-pronged
test,
an
alien
was
debarred
from
seeking
citizenship
if
he
both
applied
for
an
alien’s
exemption
and
“is
or
was
relieved
from
service
on
such
ground.”
now,
again,
it
would
certainly
been
possible
for
congress
at
that
time
to
have
settled
the
question
of
citizenship
eligibility
for
those
whose
exemptions
had
been
removed
by
the
1951
amendment
by
specifying
that
the
two-pronged
test
set
out
in
the
1950
act
would
be
applied
to
those
persons.
but,
again,
congress
did
not
specifically
referred
at
all
to
that
class
of
persons,
like
petitioner,
who
had
applied
for
alien’s
exemptions
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
1952
act--
of
the
1951
amendment
that
took
that
exemption
away.
instead,
what
congress
did
was
to
put
a
savings
clause
in
the
1952
act
which
is
section
405
(a)
of
the
act.
printed
now
is
a
note
to
8
usc
1101
which
said
that
“unless
otherwise
specifically
provided,”
all
preexisting
conditions,
rights,
acts,
things,
liabilities,
obligations,
or
matters
arising
under
prior
law
shall
continue
in
effect.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that--
i
want
to
get
to
that,
mr.
justice
white.
that
is
a
somewhat
difficult
question
to
answer
precisely.
if
we
take
the
assumption
that
is--
that
applies
or
has
applied,
it
must
be
parsed
word
for
word,
then
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
think
of
anyone
who,
at
the
time
the
1952
act
was
enacted,
had
already
applied,
we
would
not
come
under
the
rule
in
this
case,
but
this
court
in--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
would
be
s--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
would
be
subject--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that’s
right,
and--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that’s
right,
to
the--
it
would--
and
there
was
still
a
considerable
class
of
aliens
to
whom
it
would--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
think
it
is
not
unusual
for
congress
to
place
a
statute
like
that
both
in
the
present
and
the
past
tense
simply
to
be
all
inclusive
and
to
make
it
unambiguous
that
it’s
all
inclusive
at
any
time
that
it’s
read.
i
think
there’s
an
implication
that
it
means
to
be
retroactive
with
the
respect--
with
respect
to
the
time
that
it’s
enacted,
but
it
isn’t
necessarily
so
and,
in
ceballos
v.
shaughnessy,
this
question
was
raised
and
this
court
did,
indeed,
specifically
say
that
the
savings
clause
was
preserved
intact
and
that
the
general
language
is
or
has
applied
did
not
apply
to
the
petitioner
in
ceballos
v.
shaughnessy
who
is
in
an
identical
position,
as
i
shall
shortly
elaborate,
to
the
petitioner
here.
the
scheme
is
that,
unless
it
is
otherwise
specifically
provided,
petitioner
is
debarred
from
citizenship
arising
under
the
selective
service
act
of
1948
and
that,
of
course,
that
debarment
is
clearly
a
preexisting
liability
under
section
405
(a)
of
the
act.
it
simply
continues
in
effect
and
is
unaffected
by
the
test
set
out
in
section
315,
and
this
court
has
held
that
the
savings
clause
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
a
very
broad
inclusive
clause
which
has
gotten
around
only
with
great
difficulty.
in
fact,
as
mr.
justice
clark
described
section
405
(a)
in
the
menasche
case
at
348
us,
in
which
this
court
very
carefully
examined
the
history
of
the
savings
clause
is
contained
in
the
immigration
act,
and
now
i’m
quoting
from
348
us
535.
“the
consistent
broadening
of
the
savings
provision,
particularly
in
its
general
terminology,
indicates
that
this
policy
of
preservation
was
intended
to
apply
to
matters
both
within
and
without
the
specific
contemplation
of
congress.
and,
the
implication
of
that
menasche
case
seems
to
be
quite
clearly
that
the
savings
clause
of
section
405
(a)
is
applicable
unless
congress
makes
a
deliberate
and
specific
statement
of
its
intention
to
eliminate
a
preexisting
right
or
liability,
and
congress
did
not
do
that
in
section
315
in
our
view.
appropriately,
for
our
purposes
here,
what
congress
did
was
to
say
that
the
section
315
shall
apply
notwithstanding
the
provisions
of
section
405
(b).
section
405
(b)
is
also
a
savings
clause
contained
in
the
1952
act
and
it
is
significant
to
us,
though
not
necessarily
dispositive
in
light
of
other
overwhelming
evidence
as
this
court
held
in
shomberg,
that
section
315
(a)
does
specifically
accept
405
(b)
but
not
405
(a).
with
respect
to
405
(a),
we
have
only
the
general
language
of
section
315
which
covers
an
alien
who
applies
or
has
applied
for
an
alien’s
exemption
and
i
think
that
the
ceballos
case
really
closes
considering
that
clause
sufficiently,
in
general
language,
to
override
the
savings
clause.
as
i
say,
the
petitioner
in
ceballos
and
shaughnessy
was
virtually
in
a
position
virtually
identical
to
that
of
petitioner
for
these
purposes.
he
had
filed
his
application
for
exemption
before
the
date
of
the
1952
act.
the
only
difference
here
is
that,
in
ceballos,
the
procedural
posture
of
the
case
was
slightly
different.
it
involved
a
review
of
an
order
of
deportation
rather
than
a
naturalization
petition,
so
that
another
clause
of
section
405
(a)
involving
proceedings
to
suspend
deportation
was
brought
into
play.
but,
the
crucial
issue
in
ceballos,
as
here,
was
the
citizenship
eligibility
of
an
alien
who
applied
for
an
exemption,
was
later
exposed
to
the
draft,
and
was
subsequently
found
physically
unfit
for
the
service.
and,
the
court
found
that
the
general
language
of
section
315
was
simply
not
a
specific
exemption
to
the
savings
clause
of
section
405
(a).
now,
on
the
assumption
that
section
315
of
the
1952
act
does
redefine
the
citizenship
eligibility
of
petitioner
and
others
in
his
situation,
in
what
way--
the
question
is
now,
in
what
way
does
that
statute,
that
is
the
1952
act,
change
petitioner’s
eligibility
for
citizenship?
the
committee
report
of
the
senate
committee
on
the
judiciary
which
made
a
comprehensive
preliminary
study
of
the
many
provisions
of
the
1952
act
makes
very
little
reference
to
section
315
and,
what
little
there
is,
implies
to
us
that
the
committee
thought
it
was
incorporating
the
ineligibility
test
set
forth
in
the
prior
selective
service
laws.
i
guess
that
language
can’t
have
very
strong
effect
because,
after
all,
the
language
of
section
315,
as
this
court
has
held,
does
make
a
significant
addition
to
the
test
of
ineligibility
7in
that
it
requires
that
an
alien
both
apply
for
an
exemption
and
that
he’d
be
“relieved
from
service
on
such
ground,”
that
is
on--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no,
they
don’t.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
they
don’t,
mr.
justice
marshall.
they’re
not
affected
by
this
because
we
don’t
draft--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
i
assume
that--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
as
a
matter
of
practice.
i
assume
that
no
court
would
interpret
that
to
include
women
since
united
states--
the
idea,
after
all,
the
statute
is
that
aliens,
in
order
to
obtain
citizenship,
should
subject
themselves
to
the
burdens
of
american
citizens
and
american
female
citizens,
at
this
point
and
time,
don’t
have
the
burden
of
military
service.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
that’s
right.
this
is
what
we
consider
to
be
the
essential
result
of
the
language
of
section
315
in
several
courts
of
appeal
and
as
the
government
now
agrees,
aliens
who
are
subsequently
drafted
under
section
315
and
actually
served
in
the
armed
forces
are
no
longer
ineligible
for
citizenship.
in
other
words,
“relieved
from
service”
means
effectively
and
permanently
relieved
from
service,
but--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
it’s
the
second,
third,
and
ninth
circuits.
yes,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
think
that
i--
the
government
had--
did
argue
those
cases
and
contest
those
cases.
i
think
it
now
agrees
with
the
position
taken.
i
think
it
is
a
somewhat--
in
the
statutory
language,
it’s
somewhat
a
difficult
position,
but
it’s
so--
i
suppose
it
seems
repugnant
to
many
that
those
who
actually
end
up
serving
and
incurring
that
obligation
and
performing
the
duty
of
military
service
were--
really
should
be
relieved
from
their
initial
choice.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
i
think,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
that
that
is
on
the
surface
when
you
first
think
about
it,
rather
troublesome,
and
it
did--
we
do
find
that
there
are
aspects
of
our
application
of
3--
section
315
that
are
somewhat
harsh,
as
i--
we’ve
pointed
out
in
our
brief
and
as
i
want
to
get
to,
but
i
don’t
think
it’s
that
specific
aspect
because
i--
if
you
think
about
it,
what
is--
after
all,
what
is
at
stake
here
is
service.
the
distinction
made
is
with
respect
to
whether
an
alien
has
or
has
not
served,
and
if
he
has
not
served
he
can’t
get
out
of
his
initial
choice
regardless
of
what
the--
what
ground
ultimately
relieved
him
when
he
lost
his
exemption.
the
fact
that
it
is
his
failure
to
pass
the
physical
examination
which
ultimately
leads
to
his
not
serving
on
the
second--
on
his
second
chance
is
really
an
incidental
aspect
of
the
fact
that
we
make
actual
service
of
the
test.
once
a
person
has
declared
that
he’s
an
alien
and
wants
to
avail
himself
of
the
alien’s
exemption
and
chooses
not
to
become
a
citizen,
we
make
it--
we
make
service
the
test
and
the
fact
that
the
physical
exam
comes
in
to
play
is
a
rather
incidental
effect
of
that.
after
all,
there
are
many
benefits
which
congress
has
conferred
upon
veterans
and
people
who
have
served
in
the
armed
forces
that
it
doesn’t
bestow
upon
american
citizens
who
wanted
to
serve
but
were
unable
to
do
so,
ineligible
to
do
so
for
one
reason
or
another,
including
failure
to
pass
a
physical
examination.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
in
all
those
cases,
mr.
justice
white,
it
has
been
stipulated,
and
i’m
afraid
the
government
has
not
been
totally
consistent
after
the--
in
the
aftermath
of
ceballos
and
shaughnessy
in
arguing
whether
the
1952
act
or
the
1948
act
apply.
it
has
been
stipulated
that
we
would
construe
this
under
the
1952
act
and
the
only
reason
i
could
really
think
of
for
this
is
that
it--
the
language
of
the
1948
act
seems
clearly
to
make
it
irrelevant
whether
a
person
served
ultimately
or
not,
but
that
position
is
just
rather
difficult
to
stomach
in
some
way.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i’d
rather
not
face
that,
but
i
suppose
we
would
make
the
same
argument
that,
under
the
1948
act,
actual
service
didn’t
matter
and,
in
one
case,
that
was
argued
and
held
that
actual
service
did
not
matter
under
the
1948
act.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that’s
right.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
suppose
he
would
be,
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
suppose
that,
under
these
cases
which
hold
that
service
itself--
well,
i--
that--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that,
actually,
if
he
were
dishonorably
discharged,
actually
i
suppose
it
could
be
argued
depending
on
what
time
it
was
in
his
service.
it
could
be
argued
that
he
had
not--
that
he
had
been
effectively
relieved
because
he
hadn’t
really
served.
he
had--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
he
was
theoretically
subject
to
the
draft.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
he
took
the
physical.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
and,
unlike
the
first
time
he
took
the
physical--
he
failed
it,
yes.
now,
let
me
just
elaborate--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that
theory
is
not
involved
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
and
we
haven’t
argued
that
position
with
respect
to
the
1948
statute.
we’ve
asked
in
the
opinions
with
respect
to
the
1952
statute,
but
i
suppose,
theoretically,
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes.
now,
i
think
it
is
very
important
to
see
exactly
what
language
we’re
dealing
with
in
terms
of
this
distinction
between
a
person
who
has
physically--
who
has
been
relieved
from
physical
service
and
a
person
who
has
actually
served.
petitioner
proposes
that
even
though
an
alien
who
applies
for
an
exemption
on
grounds
of
alienage
is
effectively
and
permanently
relieved
from
service,
that
is
he
never
serves
in
the
armed
forces.
he
is
not
ineligible
for
citizenship
if
any
other
ground
for
exemption
ultimately
comes
into
play
and
contributes
in
any
way
that
he’s
permanently
relieved
from
service.
in
other
words,
though
he
doesn’t
explicitly
say
this,
he
would
read
the
phrase
“relieved
from
service
on
such
ground”
as
meaning
relieved
from
service
exclusively
on
grounds
of
alienage.
this
would’ve
been,
of
course,
a
rather
radical
departure
from
the
1948
statute
which,
arguably,
wouldn’t
even
have
saved
him
if
he
had
served,
but
congress
certainly
could’ve
chosen
to
adopt
this
more
generous
position
and
to
relieve
from
the
consequences
of
their
initial
choice
not
to
become
citizens
all
citizens
who
applied
for
exemptions
but
were
later
exposed
to
theoretical
liability
for
the
draft.
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
it
may
be
considered
somewhat
harsh,
in
fact,
that
congress
did
not
do
so,
though
not
for
the
reasons
suggested
by
petitioner
that
the
distinction
is
one
of
passing
a
physical
examination
because
we
consider
that
quite
incidental.
but,
we
do
feel
that
there
is,
perhaps,
something
harsh
in
the
fact
that
petitioner
did,
after
all,
originally
make
his
election
not
to
serve
in
the
armed
forces
and
not
to
become
a
citizen
on
the
assumption
that
he
would
continue
to
enjoy
the
assurance
of
an
alien’s
exemption
from
the
draft
and
he
was,
by
no
means,
entitled
to
presume
that
congress
would
not--
was
foreclosed
from
removing
his
exemption.
there’s
no
evidence
that
anyone
told
him
congress
was
so
foreclosed
but,
nonetheless,
he
probably
did
assume,
vaguely
or
otherwise,
that
because
of
his
alienage
he
would
not
have
to
think
about
liability
for
military
service
anymore.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
guess
he
would
have
assumed
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
he
would
assume
that
he
would
stay
in
the
same
condition
he
was
in
prior
to
1952.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
and,
for
that
reason,
we
consider
petitioner
in
a
much
less
harsh
application
of
the
statute
than,
perhaps,
others
similarly
situated
of
who
might
not
have
had
a
change
in
their
physical
status
between
the
time
that
they
sought
the
first
exemption
and
the
time
they
the
exemption--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i’m
afraid
i
don’t
quite
see
the--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that’s
right,
and--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
would
not
apply
for
an
alien’s
exemption,
that’s
precisely
the
point.
that’s
why
i
think
that
though
we
really
have
to
take
into
account
whether
congress--
since
section
315
is
not
after
all
crystal
clear
whether
congress
intended
to
hold
all
aliens
to
their
end
of
this
so-called
bargain,
arrangement,
those
certainly
with
the
contract.
i
don’t
think
that,
really,
the
harshness
of
our
interpretation
of
section
315,
such
as
it
is,
would
apply
in
a
case
where
an
alien
had
passed
his
physical
examination
originally
and
only
decided
to
chose
his
alien’s
exemption
after
the
fact
of
knowing
he
was
physically
fit
for
the
draft.
in
fact,
several
courts
of
appeals
have
made
related
arguments.
every
court
of
appeals
that
has
decided
this
precise
issue
has,
in
fact,
decided
in
the
government’s
favor
and
several
have
pointed
out,
in
connection
with
this
issue,
that
many
things
can
happen.
an
alien
can
assess
his
chances
of
getting
an
exemption
on
some
other
ground
that
would
not
debar
him
from
citizenship
before
he
chooses
to
claim
his
alien’s
exemption,
and
then
he
may
later
loose
that
exemption.
but,
in
the
interim
period,
many
things
that
could
happen
that
would
change
his
draft
status.
things
like
marriage
at
one
point,
occupational
defermance
or
illness.
any
of
those
things
can
happen
during
the
period
when
he
holds
his
exemption
from
the
draft
which
might
provide
him
with
permanent
relief
from
the
draft
that
he
would
not
have
had
but
for
his
original
choice
of
an
alien’s
exemption.
with
respect
to
this
petitioner,
even
if
this
court
were
to
take,
let’s
say,
an
intermediate
position
with
respect
to
section
315
that
the
alien
doesn’t
have
to
have
been
relieved
exclusively
on
grounds
of
alienage
but
that,
somehow,
the
government
must
show
that
alienage
was
the
substantial
or
even
the
major
factor
contributing
to
his
ultimate
relief.
petitioner
can’t
withstand
that
test
either,
i
don’t
think.
in
any
event,
we,
on
balance,
feel
that
the
language
of
section
315
is
quite
badly
strained
by
a
construction
that
his
release
from
alienage
must
rest
exclusively
on
grounds
of
alienage.
we
feel
that
a
more
normal
reading
of
that
language
which
refers
to
an
alien
who
is
or
was
relieved
from
service,
not
from
liability
but
from
service,
on
grounds
of
alienage
is
that,
as
long
as
the
alien’s
exemption
was
one
of
the
grounds
contributing
to
his
effective
and
permanent
relief
from
service,
he
has
been
relieved
on
such
ground
within
the
meaning
of
section
315.
we
think
this
reading
is
far
more
in
line
with
congress’
attitude
as
expressed
in
the
prior
legislation,
and
we
think
that
that
prior
legislation,
the
basic
concepts
of
that
legislation,
were
meant
to
be
retained
in
the
1952
act.
and,
for
that
reason,
we
ask
that
this
court
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit.
