when
you
say
he
wasn’t
told
what
was
really
going

happen,
precisely
what
are
you
alluding
to?
justice

you’re
talking
about
the
rule
of
elementary
fairness.
is
that
a
constitutional
rule
or
what?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so,
it’s
just
anything
that
the
majority
of
this
court
thinks
is
elementary
fair
or
unfair?
justice
harry

mr.
halvonik,
what
is
the
chronology?
initially,
did
he
not
apply
for
exemption
after
he
had
been
accepted
physically
and
had
passed
his
physical
exam?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
the
second
examination
was
how
long
after
that,
a
year-and-a
half
or
so?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
wasn’t
very
long.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
there
any
question
at
all
about
the
integrity
of
his
disability?
i
take
it--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
was
the
cause
of
the--
his
not
passing
the
physical?
was
it
bursitis?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
this
doesn’t
last
very
long.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
stone,
you
agree
with
that
result
in
the
second
and
ninth
circuits?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
what
bothers
me
mildly
is
that
then
you’re
in
a
position
of
making
eligibility
depend
on
a
successfully
physical
examination.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
stone,
i’ll
ask
you
one
more
question
following
through
with
mr.
justice
white.
suppose,
under
the
old
statute,
he
had
reconsidered
and
had
passed
and
served,
still
ineligible
in
the
government’s
theory?
