service.
mr.
halvonik,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
emphasized,
i
think
exclusively,
the
change
in
the
law.
is
there
any
other
change
factor
here
that
enters
into
this
equation
of
the
“bad
bargain,”
the
change
in
his
physical
status?
chief

warren
e.
burger
if
he’d
known
at
the
beginning,
if
he’d
known
at
the
outset
that
he
would
never
pass
the
physical
examination,
would
he
have
signed
this--
entered
into
this
engagement,
waiving
the
right
to
become
a
citizen?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose,
for
example,
that
he
had
his
right
leg
off
of
the
knee
at
the
outset,
he
just
would’ve
stood
by
and
waited
until
they
called
him
up
and
then
demonstrated
his
lack
of
physical
fitness
then--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
here,
the
physical
condition--
his
acceptability
for
military
service
altered
during
this
span
of
time
didn’t.
at
least
they
found
him
a1
physically
at
the
early
stage,
and
later
they
rejected
him.
now,
is
that
rejection
which
plays
a
very
important
part,
the
rejection
for
physical
disability
plays
a
very
important
part,
doesn’t
it?
chief

thank
you,

didn’t

assume
something
else

that

well
i
wonder,
the
laymen,
as
this
man
was,
not
a
lawyer,
thinking
in
technical
terms,
if
he
really
sat
down
and
had
a
debate
with
himself
about
all
the
elements
that
he
ought
to
waive,
surely
he
would’ve
given
priority
to
the
continued
physical
condition
that
would
render
him
eligible
and
would
be
far
less
likely
to
be
trying
to
predict
whether
congress
was
going
to
change
or
not
change
the
law.
i
think
that
would
be
true,
wouldn’t
it?
chief

warren
e.
burger
well,
if
he
sat
down
trying
to
evaluate
what
were
the
problems,
what
he
should
consider
in
his
choice.
he’d
certainly,
immediately
stop
and
consider
“well,
am
i
going
to
be
able
to
get
out
of
this
military
service
on
the
grounds
of
physical
disability?”
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
if
he
knew,
suppose
he
were
consulting
the
doctor
at
the
time
and
the
doctor
said
“you’ve
got
an
incipient
diabetic
condition,”
he
probably
then
wouldn’t
have
tried
to
rest
on
the
other
ground.
