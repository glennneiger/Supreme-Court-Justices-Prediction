mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
actually,
this
case
is
quite
simple,
the
principle
facts
occurring
in
the
years
1950-1952.
the
petitioner
here
lawfully
entered
the
united
states
for
the
purpose
of
permanent
residency
in
the
year
1950.
in
the
summer
of
that
year,
he
registered
for
the
draft.
he
was,
later
that
summer,
drafted,
but
he
didn’t
submit
to
an
induction.
he
signed
an
exemption
from
military
service
which
was
provided
by
the
1948
selective
service
law.
that
exemption
provided
that
neutral
aliens
or
permanent
residents
would
be
exempted
from
the
draft
if
they
executed
the
form.
in
exchange,
they
would
be
relieved
of
liability
for
service
in
the
armed
forces.
the
following
year,
in
1951,
congress
amended
the
draft
law
to
provide
that
permanent
resident
aliens
could
be
drafted,
thus,
removing
the
exemption,
part
of
the
bargain
in
the
favor
of
the
petitioner.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
this
was
a
drastic
departure
from
prior
law.
never
before
did
neutral
aliens
been
drafted
by
this
country
if
they
chose
not
to
be.
petitioner
was
drafted
again.
this
time
he
went
down
to
submit
to
induction,
but
he
was
rejected
because
he
did
not--
he
was
not
physically
fit
for
service.
the
next
significant
date
is
1952
when
congress
adopted
section
315
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act,
the
section
which
petitioner
contends
controls
here.
section
315
provides
what
this
court
has
characterized
as
a
two-pronged
test
where
an
alien
who
has
sought
exemption
from
military
service
is
seeking
citizenship.
it
provides
that
the
alien
must
(1)
have
sought
the
exemption
and
(2)
been
relieved
from
military
service
prior
to
that
1952
law
which
required
exemption
because,
the
execution
of
the
exemption,
because
that
also
grants
release
from
liability.
but
congress,
evidently,
because
of
the
intervening
law
taking
away
this
release
from
liability
for
aliens
who
had
signed
the
exemption
now
provided
the
two
events
had
t
occur,
and
we
contend
that
the
petitioner
was
not
relieved
from
liability
since
he
was
drafted
and
that,
therefore,
he
should
be
admitted
to
citizenship.
now,
the
government,
at
least
below
and
i
assume,
still
takes
the
position
that
had
petitioner
actually
served
in
the
armed
forces,
he
would
be
eligible
for
citizenship.
now,
we
contend
that
that’s
a
misreading
of
the
statute.
it
says
liability
from
military
service,
not
service
in
the
armed
forces,
not
actual
service.
that
if
congress
meant
actual
service,
it
would
have
said
so.
it
merely
said
those
who
were
not
relieved
from
liability
are
eligible
for
citizenship,
and
petitioner
was
not
relieved
from
liability.
moreover,
it
wouldn’t
make
much
sense
to
make
a
distinction
between
those
who
were
physically
fit
and
could
actually
serve
and
those
who
would
flump
the
physical.
the
congressional
scheme
makes
a
good
deal
of
sense.
now
the
government,
in
its
reply
brief
in
this
case,
has
raised
a
new
argument
that
was
not
raised
before,
and
that
is
that
this
section
that
has
been
the
focus
of
all
the
litigation
up
to
now,
section
315,
isn’t
applicable
to
the
case.
the
government
and
both
courts
below
thought
it
was
applicable
and
did
both
courts
below.
but,
the
government
contends
that
the
saving
clause,
which
is
section
406
(a),
of
the
immigration
and
national--
naturalization
act
keeps
petitioner’s
status
the
same
as
it
was
in
the
year
that
he
signed
the
exemption.
there
are
a
number
of
problems
with
the
argument.
first
of
all,
it’s
inconsistent
with
the
government’s
general
position
that
if
petitioner
had
served,
he
would
be
eligible
for
citizenship
because
the
section
315
act
doesn’t
apply
to
people
who
signed
the
exemption
before
1952.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
yes?
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
that’s
correct.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
their
reply
brief,
right.
that’s
the
only
brief
they
filed.
the
filed
other
briefs
in
the
courts
below,
but
i
was
referring
to--
they
have
filed,
but
the
one
brief
in--
the
brief
essentially
relies
on
this
point.
i
want
to
emphasize
that
that’s
inconsistent
with
their
general
theory
that
if
he’d
served,
he
would
be
eligible
for
citizenship
because
if
that
savings
clause
saved
all
the
disabilities
of
everybody,
then
it
would
save
those
who
also
served
in
the
armed
forces,
and--
thus,
congress,
in
trying
to
create
this
new
status
in
1952
for
people
who
was
drafting,
would
be
unsuccessful.
now--
but,
the
inconsistency,
i
think,
in
the
government’s
position
points
out
their
misreading
of
section
406
(a)
in
relation
to
section
315,
because
section
315
is
an
exception
to
the
savings
clause
in
section
406
(a).
section
315
is
meant
to
change
status.
that’s
what
it’s
there
for.
it’s
meant
to
change
the
series
of
invents
that
result
in
ineligibility
for
citizenship
and
add
a
new
condition
before
one
becomes
ineligible.
that’s
precisely
what
it’s
for
and
it,
therefore,
is
a
specific
exception
to
the
savings
clause.
it
begins
with
the
language
“notwithstanding
anything
contained
in
section
405
(b),”
which
is
another
savings
clause
that
deals
with
the
petitions
for
naturalization
that
are
pending.
and,
the
government
takes
the
position
that
since
there’s
this
“notwithstanding
section
405
(b)”
language,
therefore,
congress
meant
to
leave
section
405
(a)
as
a
continuing
status
controlling
all
of
these
cases.
well,
that’s
inconsistent
with
the
case
relied
on
by
the
government,
shomberg.
shomberg
also
started
out
with
“notwithstanding
section
405
(b)”
language,
didn’t
refer
specifically
to
section
405
(a)
but
this
court
said
“well,
it
may
well
be
that
the
ransom
could’ve
been
more
exact,
but
there
was
no
question
that
since,
in
that
case,
section
318
was
designed
specifically
for
this
problem,
it’s
designed
specifically
to
change
status,
that
it
was
an
exception
to
the
savings
clause”
and,
here,
all
you
need
to
do
is
look
at
the
language
of
section
315
to
see
that
it
is
supposed
to
have
retroactive
effect.
it
refers
to
the
past
tense.
it
refers
to
those
who
have
applied,
in
the
past,
for
exemption.
moreover,
i
think,
probably,
section
315
doesn’t
have
that
much
perspective
impact.
its
main
impact
is
retrospective.
there
are
a
very
few
people
under
the
change
of
the
laws
who
could
properly
receive
this
exemption
than
they’ll
ever
be
in
a
position
to
apply
for
citizenship
or
to
acquire
permanent
residence.
i
think
section
315
is
principally
designed
for
cases
such
as
that
one
here.
it’s
principally
designed
for
retrospective
application.
i
won’t
dwell
too
much
longer
on
section
315.
we
have,
in
our
brief,
gone
into
some
great
length
about
the
history
of
this
exemption,
about
the
history
extending
back
to
the
civil
war
of
telling
aliens
“you
can
either
accept
the
burdens
of
citizenship
or
not”
and
you
make
your
decision
and
that’s
that.
you’re
released
from
the
obligations
of
citizenship
and
you
don’t
get
the
benefits.
what
315
is
designed
to
do
is
to
take
care
of
the
people
who
did
have
the
obligation
imposed
on
them,
of
the
citizen
obligation
of
military
service
after
they
had
signed
the
exemption.
that’s
also
relevant
to
our
second
contention
in
this
case.
we
contend
in
the
brief
there
that
petition
didn’t
make
a
knowing
waiver
of
his
eligibility
for
citizenship
because
he
wasn’t
apprised
properly
of
the
nature
of
the
bargain
he
was
making.
we
rely
there
on
the
moser
case.
in
moser
it
was
held
that
though
the
alien
had
signed
the
exemption
form,
he
would
not
be
bound
to
it
because
he
had
been
officially
told
by
both
the
united
states
government
in
this
ligation
that
it
didn’t
really
mean
that
he
couldn’t
become
a
citizen,
and
the
court
here
didn’t
rely
on
the
estoppel
theory
to
say
there
wasn’t
a
knowing
waiver
of
the
eligibility
because
he
wasn’t
properly
appraised
of
the
consequences.
but,
we
say
the
same
thing
happened
here.
he
wasn’t
given
any
real
choice
because
the
choice
was
illusory.
he
wasn’t
told
really
what
was
going
to
happen.
he
was
told
“if
you
take
this
exemption,
you
will
receive
this
benefit.”
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
i’m
alluding
to
the
fact
that
he
was
told
that
he
wouldn’t
be
able
to
become
a
citizen
but
he
was
also
told
that
he
would
be
released
from
liability
for
service
in
the
armed
forces,
and
best
he
made
his
choice
looking
at
these
two
alternatives,
but
those
alternatives,
it
turns
out,
weren’t
real.
he
wasn’t
really
getting
that.
he
wasn’t
getting
that
release
from
liability.
now,
the
government
says
“well,
it’s
just
a
change
in
law,
and
that
sort
of
happens.
when
you
enter
into
a
bargain,
you
have
to
perhaps
anticipate
that
somebody
will
change
the
law."
and,
that
may
be
a
good
argument
where
it’s
a
private
contract
but,
here,
the
party
that
he
made
the
agreement
with
was
the
government
and
it
was
that
government
that
told
him
that
he
would
not
have
to
serve.
he’d
be
released
from
liability
for
military
service.
it
was
then
the
government,
the
very
institution
with
which
he
made
the
agreement,
that
went
back
on
the
promise
because
the
consideration
was
initially
illusory
and
he
was
not
given
a
fair
opportunity
to
make
a
choice
between
the
exemption
of
service.
i
think
it’s
significant
in
moser
where
this
was
referred
to
as
a
rule
of
elementary
fairness,
that
the
court
cited
johnson
v.
united
states
which
is
in
318
unites
states
reports.
and,
what
happened
in
johnson
was
this.
it
was
a
matter
that
arose
during
a
criminal
trial.
the
defendant
had
taken
the
stand
and
was
testifying,
and
then
tried
to
invoke
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
and
the
judge
permitted
him
to
invoke
that,
although
it
was
clear,
at
least
in
retrospect,
then
that,
on
appeal,
he
ruled
improperly
and
shouldn’t
have
allowed
the
defendant
to
exercise
any
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
nevertheless,
the
defendant
did
exercise
his
privilege,
but
then
the
court
permitted
the
prosecutor
to
comment
upon
it,
and
that
was
held
error
in
the
violation
of
the
rule
of
elementary
fairness
for
this
reason.
because
he--
although
he
did
get
what
he
was
told
he
would
get,
that
is
he
was
allowed
to
forgo
testifying,
he
wasn’t
told
that
the
prosecutor
would
comment
upon
it.
and,
the
court
said
in
johnson,
if
he’d
been
told
that
this
was
going
to
happen,
he
might
have
acted
very
differently.
he
would’ve
then
been
presented
with
different
sorts
of
alternatives.
he
might
have
made
a
different
sort
of
judgment,
and
we
can’t
lead
somebody
out
and
not
tell
him
all
the
facts
then
consistent
with
elementary
fairness--
elemental
fairness,
hold
him
to
his
original
position.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
i
assume
from
both
moser
and
johnson
that
it’s
a
rule
of--
that
this
court
would
enforce
if
there
weren’t
any
other
objection
to
it,
any
constitutional
objection
the
other
way.
i
don’t
know--
i
don’t
look
upon
it
as
necessarily
a
constitutional
rule,
no.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
i
think
when
you’re
resolving
situations
such
as
deciding
in
moser
whether
a
man
intelligently
waived
his
right
to
become
a
citizen,
which
is
also
the
question
here,
or
you’re
deciding
in
a
question
like
johnson
whether
a
man
intelligently
exercised
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
one
necessarily
looks
to
see
what’s
fair
and
if
he’s
been
misled
by
the
government,
it’s
hardly
fair
to
make
him
suffer
the
consequences
of
his
original
position.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
we’re
here,
i
suppose,
to
decide
two
things.
first
of
all,
whether
there
was
an
intelligent
waiver,
and
that’s
where
johnson
and
moser
are
relevant.
and,
in
deciding
whether
there’s
an
intelligent
waiver,
the
question
goes
back
into
one
of
what’s
a
fair
arrangement
when
you
offer
somebody
something
and
then
take
it
away,
and
that
goes
to
the
intelligent
waiver.
the
second
point,
i
suppose,
goes
to
one
of
statutory
construction
in
trying
to
determine
what
congress
meant
to
do
with
section
315.
now,
it’s
our
contention
that
congress
realized
that
what
it
had
done
wasn’t
fair
and
was
trying,
by
the
amendment
in
1952,
to
take
care
of
those
cases
where
they
removed
the
consideration.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
it
does.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
it
doesn’t
involve
the
constitutional
issue,
except
to
the
extent
that
one
would
think
considerations
that
were
relevant
to
this
court
in
reaching
constitutional
determinations
would
also
be
relevant
to
congress
when
they’re
trying
to
construct
the
statute.
it’s
to
that
extent
that
we’ve
raised
issues.
we’re
relying
on
the
greene
v.
mcelroy
rationality
that
unless
congress
has
explicitly
exercised
its
power
in
a
way
that
will
conflict
generally
with
fundamental
liberties,
it
will
be
assumed
that
congress
would
accord
these
guarantees
the
same
sort
of
respect
that
this
court
would.
and,
it
does
seem
to
me
also,
mr.
justice
stewart,
and
in
talking
about
fairness
when
there
might
be
an
ambiguity
in
the
statute
or
there
can
be
some
reasonable
difference
between
people
about
what
the
statute
means
that,
looking
to--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
yes,
our
constitutional
arguments,
as
i
say,
are,
it
seems
to
me,
inconceivable
that
the
court
would
declare
section
315
unconstitutional
on
the
basis
of
the
arguments
that
we
have
made.
what
we
have
said
is
that
if
section
315
were
interpreted
as
the
government
wants
it
interpreted,
we
have
a
number
of
strange
things.
we
have
a
man
not
becoming
a
citizen
because
he
can’t
pass
an
armed
force
physical,
which
is
very
peculiar.
this
has
no
relation
to
being
a
good
citizen.
additionally,
it
seems
to
be
a
forfeiture
because
of
an
illness.
now,
we
raised
those
to
point
out
that
congress
didn’t
intend
that
at
all.
when
congress
said
liability,
it
referred
to
liability,
not
actual
service,
in
the
armed
forces
and
that,
therefore,
the
statute,
consistent
with
constitutional
principles,
ought
to
be
interpreted
to,
well,
interpret
it
in
such
a
way
that
the
result
was
that
petitioner
was
eligible
for
citizenship
and
that
congress
would
have
these
things
in
mind
too.
that’s
why
it
used
the
language
it
did.
fairness
again
to
come
back
to
what
may
be
relevant
too
in
wondering
about
the
government’s
distinction
between
people
who
actually
served
and
people
who
had
not
served.
this
petitioner,
everybody
agrees,
would
make
a
fine
citizen.
he’s
lived
in
this
country
20
years.
he’s
a
vital
member
of
the
community.
we,
in
san
francisco,
refer
to
as
the
east
bay.
he’s
of
good
moral
character.
he’s
attached
the
principles
of
the
constitution.
it’s
quite
understandable,
he’s
execution
of
that
exemption
back
in
1950.
he
just
arrived
in
the
country.
he
was
looking
around.
he
hadn’t
made
a
decision
one
way
or
the
other.
he’d
just
done
14
months
to
earn
duty
with
the
danish
navy.
he
was
a
young
man.
he
didn’t
want
again
to
go
into
a
service
in
a
country
he
wasn’t
sure
now
that
he
was
going
to
take
in
place
of
his
native
land
where
he’d
already
served.
he
had
come
here
from
denmark
in
1950.
he
wasn’t
after
all
leaving
from
an
area
of
famine
or
political
oppression
to
come
to
this
country.
he
was
just
looking
around
a
bit
of
time.
after
he’d
been
here
a
while--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
he
was
23
at
that
time
period.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
yes,
there
was
a
change--
there
may
have
been
a
change
in
his
physical
status.
i
don’t
know
if
he--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
if
i
understand
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
he
knew
he
could
avoid
service
through
another
way,
would
he
have
executed
the
exemption?
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
i
would
think--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
that’s
pretty--
i
imagine
that’s
true.
it
would
be
a
very
unusual
to
go
out--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
yes,
it
does.
he
would’ve
served
had
he
not
been
rejected
for
the
physical
disability.
i
don’t
think
we
know
necessarily
whether
it
was
an
intervening
disability.
i
mean,
it
may
well
be
that
it
was
there
back
in
1950
also.
these
examinations,
in
my
experience,
are
not
always
that
thorough
when
something
might
be
picked
up
one
time
and
not
the
next.
so,
it’s
entirely
possible
that
he
had
a
disability
in
1950
and
had
he
actually
reported
for
induction,
it
would
have
been
discovered
at
that
time.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
yes,
he
passed
the
pre-induction
physical.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
about
that,
yes,
a
year-and-a
half
to--
no,
about
a
year
later,
i
guess.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
no,
it
wasn’t
very
long.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
it
must
be
conceded
that
there’s
no
question
about
it
because
the
government
admits
that
he’s
a
man
of
good
moral
character
and
i
assume
that
any
man
who
malingered
or
came
up
with
a
fraudulent
illness
in
order
to
avoid
military
service
wouldn’t
be
deemed
by
the
government
a
man
of
good
moral
character.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
it
was
bursitis,
yes.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
no,
it
doesn’t.
what
happens
here
was
that
he
was
then--
he
became
over-aged
after
he
had
not
passed
his
physical
and
he
was
then
later
on
classified
as
over
the
age
of
liability.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
ceballos
didn’t
qualify
into
the
1952
statute.
this
court
said,
there,
it
was
a
1951
and,
thus,
he
didn’t
have
the
advantage
of
the
two-pronged
tests.
ceballos
raises
some
other
points,
it
seems
to
me,
that
may
be
relevant.
i
should
distinguish
it
in
relation
to
moser
argument,
this
idea
of
the
government
entering
into
a
bargain
and
then
not
keeping
its
part
and
whether
that’s
pertinent
here.
ceballos
is
a
little
different
case
because
it
isn’t
the
government.
it
wasn’t
any
action
of
the
government
that
took
away
from
him
the
bargain.
well,
this
country’s
status
changed
and
that’s
something
i
suppose
you
have
to
expect
when
you
take
advantage
of
a
neutral
alien
status
that
your
country
may
become
co-belligerent.
but--
so,
it
was
events
that
changed
the
bargain
there,
a
fence
on
the
outside,
but
here
what
changed
the
bargain
was
the
government’s
taking
away
its
part
of
the
consideration,
the
government
itself.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
i
believe
that’s
the
case.
you
will
have
to
ask
the
government,
but
that
has
been
the
government’s
position
in
the
courts
below.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
and
the
ninth
circuit,
the
lacher
case
in
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
that’s
right.
that
seems
to
be
the
significant
factor
here.
the
passage
of
time,
of
course,
that
relate
back
to
this
question
about
his
physical
change,
the
passage
of
time
whenever
you
defer
your
military
service,
certain
interesting
things
are
likely
to
occur
in
between
them.
it
makes
this
kind
of
service
you
do
different
than
it
would’ve
been.
now,
these
may
be
in
your
favor
or
they
may
not
be
in
your
favor
at
all.
lacher,
for
example,
was
a
case
that
the
government
has
sup--
says
it
was
decided
correctly
in
the
ninth
circuit,
a
man
who
applied
for
the
exemption
but
actually
served
and
got
advantage
of
the
two-pronged
test.
but,
lacher,
it’s
interesting
to
note,
by
postponing
his
induction
was
able
to
avoid
the
korean
war,
which
made
life
somewhat
simpler
for
him,
i
should
suppose.
he
didn’t
go
in
when
it
was
really
a
shooting
war.
now
this
petition,
on
the
other
hand,
had
he
passed
the
physical,
would’ve
been
enduring
the
korean
war
and
he
didn’t
know
he
wasn’t
going
to
pass
his
physical.
he
wrapped
up
his
life
and
it
went
down
and
tried
to
get
into
service,
tried
to
recognize
the
obligation
that
was
imposed
by
the
order
to
report
for
induction.
when
a
man
actually
serves
after
being--
after
signing
this
exemption
and
being
told
that
he
won’t
have
to,
the
unfairness,
the
lack
of
the
bargain
here,
the
government’s
not
meeting
its
end
of
the
bargain
is
obvious,
just
vividly.
but,
i
can’t
see
where
it’s
any
different
when
a
man
doesn’t
serve
because
he
can’t
pass
the
physical.
he’s
done
everything
in
his
power
that
he
can
possibly
do
to
accept
the
obligation
and
to
manifest
his
recognition
of
the
obligations
that
he’s
assumed
now.
it
happens,
in
both
cases,
that
the
man
does
everything
possible.
one
man
just
physically
isn’t
able
to
enter
the
armed
forces,
and
that
can’t
be
a
distinction
between
whether
a
man
becomes
a
citizen
or
not,
and
the
language
of
the
statute
doesn’t
say
that.
i
submit
that
if
congress
wanted
only
those
people
to
be
admitted
to
citizenship,
who
had
entered
the
armed
forces,
it
would’ve
said
“applied
for
the
exemption
and
actually
did
not
serve
in
the
armed
forces,”
that
those
were
people
who
were
ineligible
for
citizenship,
but
it
doesn’t
say
that.
it
says
“people
who
are
ineligible
for
citizenship
or
people
who
want
to
sign
the
exemption
until
relieved
from
military
liability,”
and
military
liability
is
what
petitioner
had.
he
wasn’t
relieved
from
that,
and
that’s
the
language
of
the
statute
and
that’s
the
language
that
should
control
here.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
that,
as
i
understand
it,
it’s
the
government’s
position
and
i
think
that’s
in
kemble,
and
it
isn’t
supported
at
all
by
the
language
of
the
statute
which,
again
i
emphasize,
refers
to
liability
and
in
any
case
when
we’re
talking
about
liability
for
military
service,
we’re
talking
about
having
to
submit
to
induction,
and
that’s
not
actually
serving
in
the
armed
forces.
in
every
area
of
the
law,
by
“liability”
we
mean
that
there’s
a
classified
in
1a,
ordered
to
report
for
induction,
that
you
become
liable.
you
don’t
recognize
your
obligation,
you’re
prosecuted,
but
the
liability
is
demonstrated
when
that
order
to
report
for
induction
comes,
not
if
you
pass
the
physical
examination.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
thank
you.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
just
go
to
the
last
point
that
was
raised
there
on
what
happens
with
this
interim
period
if
you’ve
got
to
postponement
of
the
period
for
induction
in
the
services.
that
obviously
can
cut
both
ways.
if
you
take
a--
if
you
have
an
opportunity
to
postpone
your
induction
and
you
do
it
during
peace
time
then
find
yourself
called
two
years
later
and
there’s
a
war,
obviously
it’s
a
less
congenial
setting
for
entering
into
the
armed
services.
but,
this
man
didn’t
set
out
to
postpone
anything.
the
arraignment
he
was
given
was
that
he
wasn’t
going
to
be
drafted
and
said
he
was
relieved
from
liability.
he
wasn’t
going
to
consider
whether
his
physical
state
was
going
to
change
and
231
doesn’t
expect,
in
the
next
couple
of
years,
to
be
physically
unfit
for
service
anyway,
but
that
didn’t
enter
into
his
thinking
at
all.
the
arraignment
was
you’re
never
going
to
be
a
citizen.
on
the
other
hand,
you’ll
never
have
this
obligation
of
citizenship.
never
have
the
obligation,
not
that
it’s
postponed,
but
that
it’s
extinguished,
that
that’s
a
job
for
citizens
and
you’re
not
going
to
be
one,
and
he
didn’t
have
any
theoretical
liability.
he
was
actually
called.
he
had
to
change
his
life,
wrap
up
his
business,
go
down.
he
was
all
prepared
to
serve.
and,
in
doing
that
action,
he
demonstrated
as
much
as
he
was
possible
to
demonstrate
that
he
was
willing
to
assume
that
obligation.
he
demonstrated
it
to
the
same
extent
as
those
who
passed
physical.
now,
one
other
point
raised
by
mr.
stone
was
whether
the
section
405
(a)
savings
clause
is
applicable
to
section
315
by
virtue
of
the
ceballos
decision.
he’s
referring
to
footnote
17
in
ceballos.
ceballos,
as
i
noted
before,
was
a
1951
case.
the
1952
statute
was
held
applicable
to
his
case.
there’s
also
a
note
that
says
that
this--
the
procedures
initiated
against
him
for
deportation
were
saved
by
the
clause
and,
therefore,
even
if
he’d
come
afterwards
he
probably
wouldn’t
be
able
to
stop
the
deportation.
it’s
a
shomberg
case,
and
that’s
what
the
reference
is
to.
it’s
true,
there’s
nothing
in
section
315
that
specifically
changes
any
procedures
that
would
be
going
against
you
at
the
time.
there
is
no
procedural
specific
exception
to
the
prior
law,
so
that
if
a
procedure
had
been
begun
against
the
petitioner,
for
example,
for
deportation,
it
would
be
beside
the
point
that
he
had
a
new
status
after
1952
because
he
couldn’t
take
advantage
of
it
because
the
proceedings
for
deportation
would
go
pursuant
to
the
1948
law,
but
what
section
315
does
do
specifically
is
change
the
status.
it
doesn’t
change
procedures,
but
it
changes
status,
and
it
makes
eligible
for
citizenship
those
who
were
not
eligible
before.
and,
we
submit,
that
the
reason
congress
did
that
was
because
it
was
not
living
up
to
its
prior
bargain
and
now
it
tried
to
meet
its
obligation,
and
it
has
retroactive
language.
it
seems
the
most
reasonable
thing
in
the
world
for
congress
to
do.
it
seems
the
fairest
thing
for
congress
to
do
and
it’s
very
hard
to
explain
the
language
as
applied,
as
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out,
without
applying
this
thing
retroactively.
finally,
i
again
point
out,
as
mr.
justice
white
did,
the
government’s
position
is
totally
inconsistent
as
to
those
who
actually
served.
either
1952
applies
retroactively
or
it
doesn’t.
it
can’t
apply
retroactively
to
people
who
passed
physicals
and
not
apply
retroactively
to
people
who
flunk
physicals.
thank
you.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
actually,
this
case
is
quite
simple,
the
principle
facts
occurring
in
the
years
1950-1952.
the
petitioner
here
lawfully
entered
the
united
states
for
the
purpose
of
permanent
residency
in
the
year
1950.
in
the
summer
of
that
year,
he
registered
for
the
draft.
he
was,
later
that
summer,
drafted,
but
he
didn’t
submit
to
an
induction.
he
signed
an
exemption
from
military
service
which
was
provided
by
the
1948
selective
service
law.
that
exemption
provided
that
neutral
aliens
or
permanent
residents
would
be
exempted
from
the
draft
if
they
executed
the
form.
in
exchange,
they
would
be
relieved
of
liability
for
service
in
the
armed
forces.
the
following
year,
in
1951,
congress
amended
the
draft
law
to
provide
that
permanent
resident
aliens
could
be
drafted,
thus,
removing
the
exemption,
part
of
the
bargain
in
the
favor
of
the
petitioner.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
this
was
a
drastic
departure
from
prior
law.
never
before
did
neutral
aliens
been
drafted
by
this
country
if
they
chose
not
to
be.
petitioner
was
drafted
again.
this
time
he
went
down
to
submit
to
induction,
but
he
was
rejected
because
he
did
not--
he
was
not
physically
fit
for
service.
the
next
significant
date
is
1952
when
congress
adopted
section
315
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act,
the
section
which
petitioner
contends
controls
here.
section
315
provides
what
this
court
has
characterized
as
a
two-pronged
test
where
an
alien
who
has
sought
exemption
from
military
service
is
seeking
citizenship.
it
provides
that
the
alien
must
(1)
have
sought
the
exemption
and
(2)
been
relieved
from
military
service
prior
to
that
1952
law
which
required
exemption
because,
the
execution
of
the
exemption,
because
that
also
grants
release
from
liability.
but
congress,
evidently,
because
of
the
intervening
law
taking
away
this
release
from
liability
for
aliens
who
had
signed
the
exemption
now
provided
the
two
events
had
t
occur,
and
we
contend
that
the
petitioner
was
not
relieved
from
liability
since
he
was
drafted
and
that,
therefore,
he
should
be
admitted
to
citizenship.
now,
the
government,
at
least
below
and
i
assume,
still
takes
the
position
that
had
petitioner
actually
served
in
the
armed
forces,
he
would
be
eligible
for
citizenship.
now,
we
contend
that
that’s
a
misreading
of
the
statute.
it
says
liability
from
military
service,
not
service
in
the
armed
forces,
not
actual
service.
that
if
congress
meant
actual
service,
it
would
have
said
so.
it
merely
said
those
who
were
not
relieved
from
liability
are
eligible
for
citizenship,
and
petitioner
was
not
relieved
from
liability.
moreover,
it
wouldn’t
make
much
sense
to
make
a
distinction
between
those
who
were
physically
fit
and
could
actually
serve
and
those
who
would
flump
the
physical.
the
congressional
scheme
makes
a
good
deal
of
sense.
now
the
government,
in
its
reply
brief
in
this
case,
has
raised
a
new
argument
that
was
not
raised
before,
and
that
is
that
this
section
that
has
been
the
focus
of
all
the
litigation
up
to
now,
section
315,
isn’t
applicable
to
the
case.
the
government
and
both
courts
below
thought
it
was
applicable
and
did
both
courts
below.
but,
the
government
contends
that
the
saving
clause,
which
is
section
406
(a),
of
the
immigration
and
national--
naturalization
act
keeps
petitioner’s
status
the
same
as
it
was
in
the
year
that
he
signed
the
exemption.
there
are
a
number
of
problems
with
the
argument.
first
of
all,
it’s
inconsistent
with
the
government’s
general
position
that
if
petitioner
had
served,
he
would
be
eligible
for
citizenship
because
the
section
315
act
doesn’t
apply
to
people
who
signed
the
exemption
before
1952.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
yes?
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
that’s
correct.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
their
reply
brief,
right.
that’s
the
only
brief
they
filed.
the
filed
other
briefs
in
the
courts
below,
but
i
was
referring
to--
they
have
filed,
but
the
one
brief
in--
the
brief
essentially
relies
on
this
point.
i
want
to
emphasize
that
that’s
inconsistent
with
their
general
theory
that
if
he’d
served,
he
would
be
eligible
for
citizenship
because
if
that
savings
clause
saved
all
the
disabilities
of
everybody,
then
it
would
save
those
who
also
served
in
the
armed
forces,
and--
thus,
congress,
in
trying
to
create
this
new
status
in
1952
for
people
who
was
drafting,
would
be
unsuccessful.
now--
but,
the
inconsistency,
i
think,
in
the
government’s
position
points
out
their
misreading
of
section
406
(a)
in
relation
to
section
315,
because
section
315
is
an
exception
to
the
savings
clause
in
section
406
(a).
section
315
is
meant
to
change
status.
that’s
what
it’s
there
for.
it’s
meant
to
change
the
series
of
invents
that
result
in
ineligibility
for
citizenship
and
add
a
new
condition
before
one
becomes
ineligible.
that’s
precisely
what
it’s
for
and
it,
therefore,
is
a
specific
exception
to
the
savings
clause.
it
begins
with
the
language
“notwithstanding
anything
contained
in
section
405
(b),”
which
is
another
savings
clause
that
deals
with
the
petitions
for
naturalization
that
are
pending.
and,
the
government
takes
the
position
that
since
there’s
this
“notwithstanding
section
405
(b)”
language,
therefore,
congress
meant
to
leave
section
405
(a)
as
a
continuing
status
controlling
all
of
these
cases.
well,
that’s
inconsistent
with
the
case
relied
on
by
the
government,
shomberg.
shomberg
also
started
out
with
“notwithstanding
section
405
(b)”
language,
didn’t
refer
specifically
to
section
405
(a)
but
this
court
said
“well,
it
may
well
be
that
the
ransom
could’ve
been
more
exact,
but
there
was
no
question
that
since,
in
that
case,
section
318
was
designed
specifically
for
this
problem,
it’s
designed
specifically
to
change
status,
that
it
was
an
exception
to
the
savings
clause”
and,
here,
all
you
need
to
do
is
look
at
the
language
of
section
315
to
see
that
it
is
supposed
to
have
retroactive
effect.
it
refers
to
the
past
tense.
it
refers
to
those
who
have
applied,
in
the
past,
for
exemption.
moreover,
i
think,
probably,
section
315
doesn’t
have
that
much
perspective
impact.
its
main
impact
is
retrospective.
there
are
a
very
few
people
under
the
change
of
the
laws
who
could
properly
receive
this
exemption
than
they’ll
ever
be
in
a
position
to
apply
for
citizenship
or
to
acquire
permanent
residence.
i
think
section
315
is
principally
designed
for
cases
such
as
that
one
here.
it’s
principally
designed
for
retrospective
application.
i
won’t
dwell
too
much
longer
on
section
315.
we
have,
in
our
brief,
gone
into
some
great
length
about
the
history
of
this
exemption,
about
the
history
extending
back
to
the
civil
war
of
telling
aliens
“you
can
either
accept
the
burdens
of
citizenship
or
not”
and
you
make
your
decision
and
that’s
that.
you’re
released
from
the
obligations
of
citizenship
and
you
don’t
get
the
benefits.
what
315
is
designed
to
do
is
to
take
care
of
the
people
who
did
have
the
obligation
imposed
on
them,
of
the
citizen
obligation
of
military
service
after
they
had
signed
the
exemption.
that’s
also
relevant
to
our
second
contention
in
this
case.
we
contend
in
the
brief
there
that
petition
didn’t
make
a
knowing
waiver
of
his
eligibility
for
citizenship
because
he
wasn’t
apprised
properly
of
the
nature
of
the
bargain
he
was
making.
we
rely
there
on
the
moser
case.
in
moser
it
was
held
that
though
the
alien
had
signed
the
exemption
form,
he
would
not
be
bound
to
it
because
he
had
been
officially
told
by
both
the
united
states
government
in
this
ligation
that
it
didn’t
really
mean
that
he
couldn’t
become
a
citizen,
and
the
court
here
didn’t
rely
on
the
estoppel
theory
to
say
there
wasn’t
a
knowing
waiver
of
the
eligibility
because
he
wasn’t
properly
appraised
of
the
consequences.
but,
we
say
the
same
thing
happened
here.
he
wasn’t
given
any
real
choice
because
the
choice
was
illusory.
he
wasn’t
told
really
what
was
going
to
happen.
he
was
told
“if
you
take
this
exemption,
you
will
receive
this
benefit.”
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
i’m
alluding
to
the
fact
that
he
was
told
that
he
wouldn’t
be
able
to
become
a
citizen
but
he
was
also
told
that
he
would
be
released
from
liability
for
service
in
the
armed
forces,
and
best
he
made
his
choice
looking
at
these
two
alternatives,
but
those
alternatives,
it
turns
out,
weren’t
real.
he
wasn’t
really
getting
that.
he
wasn’t
getting
that
release
from
liability.
now,
the
government
says
“well,
it’s
just
a
change
in
law,
and
that
sort
of
happens.
when
you
enter
into
a
bargain,
you
have
to
perhaps
anticipate
that
somebody
will
change
the
law."
and,
that
may
be
a
good
argument
where
it’s
a
private
contract
but,
here,
the
party
that
he
made
the
agreement
with
was
the
government
and
it
was
that
government
that
told
him
that
he
would
not
have
to
serve.
he’d
be
released
from
liability
for
military
service.
it
was
then
the
government,
the
very
institution
with
which
he
made
the
agreement,
that
went
back
on
the
promise
because
the
consideration
was
initially
illusory
and
he
was
not
given
a
fair
opportunity
to
make
a
choice
between
the
exemption
of
service.
i
think
it’s
significant
in
moser
where
this
was
referred
to
as
a
rule
of
elementary
fairness,
that
the
court
cited
johnson
v.
united
states
which
is
in
318
unites
states
reports.
and,
what
happened
in
johnson
was
this.
it
was
a
matter
that
arose
during
a
criminal
trial.
the
defendant
had
taken
the
stand
and
was
testifying,
and
then
tried
to
invoke
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
and
the
judge
permitted
him
to
invoke
that,
although
it
was
clear,
at
least
in
retrospect,
then
that,
on
appeal,
he
ruled
improperly
and
shouldn’t
have
allowed
the
defendant
to
exercise
any
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
nevertheless,
the
defendant
did
exercise
his
privilege,
but
then
the
court
permitted
the
prosecutor
to
comment
upon
it,
and
that
was
held
error
in
the
violation
of
the
rule
of
elementary
fairness
for
this
reason.
because
he--
although
he
did
get
what
he
was
told
he
would
get,
that
is
he
was
allowed
to
forgo
testifying,
he
wasn’t
told
that
the
prosecutor
would
comment
upon
it.
and,
the
court
said
in
johnson,
if
he’d
been
told
that
this
was
going
to
happen,
he
might
have
acted
very
differently.
he
would’ve
then
been
presented
with
different
sorts
of
alternatives.
he
might
have
made
a
different
sort
of
judgment,
and
we
can’t
lead
somebody
out
and
not
tell
him
all
the
facts
then
consistent
with
elementary
fairness--
elemental
fairness,
hold
him
to
his
original
position.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
i
assume
from
both
moser
and
johnson
that
it’s
a
rule
of--
that
this
court
would
enforce
if
there
weren’t
any
other
objection
to
it,
any
constitutional
objection
the
other
way.
i
don’t
know--
i
don’t
look
upon
it
as
necessarily
a
constitutional
rule,
no.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
i
think
when
you’re
resolving
situations
such
as
deciding
in
moser
whether
a
man
intelligently
waived
his
right
to
become
a
citizen,
which
is
also
the
question
here,
or
you’re
deciding
in
a
question
like
johnson
whether
a
man
intelligently
exercised
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
one
necessarily
looks
to
see
what’s
fair
and
if
he’s
been
misled
by
the
government,
it’s
hardly
fair
to
make
him
suffer
the
consequences
of
his
original
position.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
we’re
here,
i
suppose,
to
decide
two
things.
first
of
all,
whether
there
was
an
intelligent
waiver,
and
that’s
where
johnson
and
moser
are
relevant.
and,
in
deciding
whether
there’s
an
intelligent
waiver,
the
question
goes
back
into
one
of
what’s
a
fair
arrangement
when
you
offer
somebody
something
and
then
take
it
away,
and
that
goes
to
the
intelligent
waiver.
the
second
point,
i
suppose,
goes
to
one
of
statutory
construction
in
trying
to
determine
what
congress
meant
to
do
with
section
315.
now,
it’s
our
contention
that
congress
realized
that
what
it
had
done
wasn’t
fair
and
was
trying,
by
the
amendment
in
1952,
to
take
care
of
those
cases
where
they
removed
the
consideration.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
it
does.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
it
doesn’t
involve
the
constitutional
issue,
except
to
the
extent
that
one
would
think
considerations
that
were
relevant
to
this
court
in
reaching
constitutional
determinations
would
also
be
relevant
to
congress
when
they’re
trying
to
construct
the
statute.
it’s
to
that
extent
that
we’ve
raised
issues.
we’re
relying
on
the
greene
v.
mcelroy
rationality
that
unless
congress
has
explicitly
exercised
its
power
in
a
way
that
will
conflict
generally
with
fundamental
liberties,
it
will
be
assumed
that
congress
would
accord
these
guarantees
the
same
sort
of
respect
that
this
court
would.
and,
it
does
seem
to
me
also,
mr.
justice
stewart,
and
in
talking
about
fairness
when
there
might
be
an
ambiguity
in
the
statute
or
there
can
be
some
reasonable
difference
between
people
about
what
the
statute
means
that,
looking
to--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
yes,
our
constitutional
arguments,
as
i
say,
are,
it
seems
to
me,
inconceivable
that
the
court
would
declare
section
315
unconstitutional
on
the
basis
of
the
arguments
that
we
have
made.
what
we
have
said
is
that
if
section
315
were
interpreted
as
the
government
wants
it
interpreted,
we
have
a
number
of
strange
things.
we
have
a
man
not
becoming
a
citizen
because
he
can’t
pass
an
armed
force
physical,
which
is
very
peculiar.
this
has
no
relation
to
being
a
good
citizen.
additionally,
it
seems
to
be
a
forfeiture
because
of
an
illness.
now,
we
raised
those
to
point
out
that
congress
didn’t
intend
that
at
all.
when
congress
said
liability,
it
referred
to
liability,
not
actual
service,
in
the
armed
forces
and
that,
therefore,
the
statute,
consistent
with
constitutional
principles,
ought
to
be
interpreted
to,
well,
interpret
it
in
such
a
way
that
the
result
was
that
petitioner
was
eligible
for
citizenship
and
that
congress
would
have
these
things
in
mind
too.
that’s
why
it
used
the
language
it
did.
fairness
again
to
come
back
to
what
may
be
relevant
too
in
wondering
about
the
government’s
distinction
between
people
who
actually
served
and
people
who
had
not
served.
this
petitioner,
everybody
agrees,
would
make
a
fine
citizen.
he’s
lived
in
this
country
20
years.
he’s
a
vital
member
of
the
community.
we,
in
san
francisco,
refer
to
as
the
east
bay.
he’s
of
good
moral
character.
he’s
attached
the
principles
of
the
constitution.
it’s
quite
understandable,
he’s
execution
of
that
exemption
back
in
1950.
he
just
arrived
in
the
country.
he
was
looking
around.
he
hadn’t
made
a
decision
one
way
or
the
other.
he’d
just
done
14
months
to
earn
duty
with
the
danish
navy.
he
was
a
young
man.
he
didn’t
want
again
to
go
into
a
service
in
a
country
he
wasn’t
sure
now
that
he
was
going
to
take
in
place
of
his
native
land
where
he’d
already
served.
he
had
come
here
from
denmark
in
1950.
he
wasn’t
after
all
leaving
from
an
area
of
famine
or
political
oppression
to
come
to
this
country.
he
was
just
looking
around
a
bit
of
time.
after
he’d
been
here
a
while--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
he
was
23
at
that
time
period.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
yes,
there
was
a
change--
there
may
have
been
a
change
in
his
physical
status.
i
don’t
know
if
he--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
if
i
understand
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
he
knew
he
could
avoid
service
through
another
way,
would
he
have
executed
the
exemption?
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
i
would
think--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
that’s
pretty--
i
imagine
that’s
true.
it
would
be
a
very
unusual
to
go
out--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
yes,
it
does.
he
would’ve
served
had
he
not
been
rejected
for
the
physical
disability.
i
don’t
think
we
know
necessarily
whether
it
was
an
intervening
disability.
i
mean,
it
may
well
be
that
it
was
there
back
in
1950
also.
these
examinations,
in
my
experience,
are
not
always
that
thorough
when
something
might
be
picked
up
one
time
and
not
the
next.
so,
it’s
entirely
possible
that
he
had
a
disability
in
1950
and
had
he
actually
reported
for
induction,
it
would
have
been
discovered
at
that
time.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
yes,
he
passed
the
pre-induction
physical.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
about
that,
yes,
a
year-and-a
half
to--
no,
about
a
year
later,
i
guess.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
no,
it
wasn’t
very
long.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
it
must
be
conceded
that
there’s
no
question
about
it
because
the
government
admits
that
he’s
a
man
of
good
moral
character
and
i
assume
that
any
man
who
malingered
or
came
up
with
a
fraudulent
illness
in
order
to
avoid
military
service
wouldn’t
be
deemed
by
the
government
a
man
of
good
moral
character.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
it
was
bursitis,
yes.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
no,
it
doesn’t.
what
happens
here
was
that
he
was
then--
he
became
over-aged
after
he
had
not
passed
his
physical
and
he
was
then
later
on
classified
as
over
the
age
of
liability.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
ceballos
didn’t
qualify
into
the
1952
statute.
this
court
said,
there,
it
was
a
1951
and,
thus,
he
didn’t
have
the
advantage
of
the
two-pronged
tests.
ceballos
raises
some
other
points,
it
seems
to
me,
that
may
be
relevant.
i
should
distinguish
it
in
relation
to
moser
argument,
this
idea
of
the
government
entering
into
a
bargain
and
then
not
keeping
its
part
and
whether
that’s
pertinent
here.
ceballos
is
a
little
different
case
because
it
isn’t
the
government.
it
wasn’t
any
action
of
the
government
that
took
away
from
him
the
bargain.
well,
this
country’s
status
changed
and
that’s
something
i
suppose
you
have
to
expect
when
you
take
advantage
of
a
neutral
alien
status
that
your
country
may
become
co-belligerent.
but--
so,
it
was
events
that
changed
the
bargain
there,
a
fence
on
the
outside,
but
here
what
changed
the
bargain
was
the
government’s
taking
away
its
part
of
the
consideration,
the
government
itself.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
i
believe
that’s
the
case.
you
will
have
to
ask
the
government,
but
that
has
been
the
government’s
position
in
the
courts
below.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
and
the
ninth
circuit,
the
lacher
case
in
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
that’s
right.
that
seems
to
be
the
significant
factor
here.
the
passage
of
time,
of
course,
that
relate
back
to
this
question
about
his
physical
change,
the
passage
of
time
whenever
you
defer
your
military
service,
certain
interesting
things
are
likely
to
occur
in
between
them.
it
makes
this
kind
of
service
you
do
different
than
it
would’ve
been.
now,
these
may
be
in
your
favor
or
they
may
not
be
in
your
favor
at
all.
lacher,
for
example,
was
a
case
that
the
government
has
sup--
says
it
was
decided
correctly
in
the
ninth
circuit,
a
man
who
applied
for
the
exemption
but
actually
served
and
got
advantage
of
the
two-pronged
test.
but,
lacher,
it’s
interesting
to
note,
by
postponing
his
induction
was
able
to
avoid
the
korean
war,
which
made
life
somewhat
simpler
for
him,
i
should
suppose.
he
didn’t
go
in
when
it
was
really
a
shooting
war.
now
this
petition,
on
the
other
hand,
had
he
passed
the
physical,
would’ve
been
enduring
the
korean
war
and
he
didn’t
know
he
wasn’t
going
to
pass
his
physical.
he
wrapped
up
his
life
and
it
went
down
and
tried
to
get
into
service,
tried
to
recognize
the
obligation
that
was
imposed
by
the
order
to
report
for
induction.
when
a
man
actually
serves
after
being--
after
signing
this
exemption
and
being
told
that
he
won’t
have
to,
the
unfairness,
the
lack
of
the
bargain
here,
the
government’s
not
meeting
its
end
of
the
bargain
is
obvious,
just
vividly.
but,
i
can’t
see
where
it’s
any
different
when
a
man
doesn’t
serve
because
he
can’t
pass
the
physical.
he’s
done
everything
in
his
power
that
he
can
possibly
do
to
accept
the
obligation
and
to
manifest
his
recognition
of
the
obligations
that
he’s
assumed
now.
it
happens,
in
both
cases,
that
the
man
does
everything
possible.
one
man
just
physically
isn’t
able
to
enter
the
armed
forces,
and
that
can’t
be
a
distinction
between
whether
a
man
becomes
a
citizen
or
not,
and
the
language
of
the
statute
doesn’t
say
that.
i
submit
that
if
congress
wanted
only
those
people
to
be
admitted
to
citizenship,
who
had
entered
the
armed
forces,
it
would’ve
said
“applied
for
the
exemption
and
actually
did
not
serve
in
the
armed
forces,”
that
those
were
people
who
were
ineligible
for
citizenship,
but
it
doesn’t
say
that.
it
says
“people
who
are
ineligible
for
citizenship
or
people
who
want
to
sign
the
exemption
until
relieved
from
military
liability,”
and
military
liability
is
what
petitioner
had.
he
wasn’t
relieved
from
that,
and
that’s
the
language
of
the
statute
and
that’s
the
language
that
should
control
here.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
that,
as
i
understand
it,
it’s
the
government’s
position
and
i
think
that’s
in
kemble,
and
it
isn’t
supported
at
all
by
the
language
of
the
statute
which,
again
i
emphasize,
refers
to
liability
and
in
any
case
when
we’re
talking
about
liability
for
military
service,
we’re
talking
about
having
to
submit
to
induction,
and
that’s
not
actually
serving
in
the
armed
forces.
in
every
area
of
the
law,
by
“liability”
we
mean
that
there’s
a
classified
in
1a,
ordered
to
report
for
induction,
that
you
become
liable.
you
don’t
recognize
your
obligation,
you’re
prosecuted,
but
the
liability
is
demonstrated
when
that
order
to
report
for
induction
comes,
not
if
you
pass
the
physical
examination.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
thank
you.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
just
go
to
the
last
point
that
was
raised
there
on
what
happens
with
this
interim
period
if
you’ve
got
to
postponement
of
the
period
for
induction
in
the
services.
that
obviously
can
cut
both
ways.
if
you
take
a--
if
you
have
an
opportunity
to
postpone
your
induction
and
you
do
it
during
peace
time
then
find
yourself
called
two
years
later
and
there’s
a
war,
obviously
it’s
a
less
congenial
setting
for
entering
into
the
armed
services.
but,
this
man
didn’t
set
out
to
postpone
anything.
the
arraignment
he
was
given
was
that
he
wasn’t
going
to
be
drafted
and
said
he
was
relieved
from
liability.
he
wasn’t
going
to
consider
whether
his
physical
state
was
going
to
change
and
231
doesn’t
expect,
in
the
next
couple
of
years,
to
be
physically
unfit
for
service
anyway,
but
that
didn’t
enter
into
his
thinking
at
all.
the
arraignment
was
you’re
never
going
to
be
a
citizen.
on
the
other
hand,
you’ll
never
have
this
obligation
of
citizenship.
never
have
the
obligation,
not
that
it’s
postponed,
but
that
it’s
extinguished,
that
that’s
a
job
for
citizens
and
you’re
not
going
to
be
one,
and
he
didn’t
have
any
theoretical
liability.
he
was
actually
called.
he
had
to
change
his
life,
wrap
up
his
business,
go
down.
he
was
all
prepared
to
serve.
and,
in
doing
that
action,
he
demonstrated
as
much
as
he
was
possible
to
demonstrate
that
he
was
willing
to
assume
that
obligation.
he
demonstrated
it
to
the
same
extent
as
those
who
passed
physical.
now,
one
other
point
raised
by
mr.
stone
was
whether
the
section
405
(a)
savings
clause
is
applicable
to
section
315
by
virtue
of
the
ceballos
decision.
he’s
referring
to
footnote
17
in
ceballos.
ceballos,
as
i
noted
before,
was
a
1951
case.
the
1952
statute
was
held
applicable
to
his
case.
there’s
also
a
note
that
says
that
this--
the
procedures
initiated
against
him
for
deportation
were
saved
by
the
clause
and,
therefore,
even
if
he’d
come
afterwards
he
probably
wouldn’t
be
able
to
stop
the
deportation.
it’s
a
shomberg
case,
and
that’s
what
the
reference
is
to.
it’s
true,
there’s
nothing
in
section
315
that
specifically
changes
any
procedures
that
would
be
going
against
you
at
the
time.
there
is
no
procedural
specific
exception
to
the
prior
law,
so
that
if
a
procedure
had
been
begun
against
the
petitioner,
for
example,
for
deportation,
it
would
be
beside
the
point
that
he
had
a
new
status
after
1952
because
he
couldn’t
take
advantage
of
it
because
the
proceedings
for
deportation
would
go
pursuant
to
the
1948
law,
but
what
section
315
does
do
specifically
is
change
the
status.
it
doesn’t
change
procedures,
but
it
changes
status,
and
it
makes
eligible
for
citizenship
those
who
were
not
eligible
before.
and,
we
submit,
that
the
reason
congress
did
that
was
because
it
was
not
living
up
to
its
prior
bargain
and
now
it
tried
to
meet
its
obligation,
and
it
has
retroactive
language.
it
seems
the
most
reasonable
thing
in
the
world
for
congress
to
do.
it
seems
the
fairest
thing
for
congress
to
do
and
it’s
very
hard
to
explain
the
language
as
applied,
as
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out,
without
applying
this
thing
retroactively.
finally,
i
again
point
out,
as
mr.
justice
white
did,
the
government’s
position
is
totally
inconsistent
as
to
those
who
actually
served.
either
1952
applies
retroactively
or
it
doesn’t.
it
can’t
apply
retroactively
to
people
who
passed
physicals
and
not
apply
retroactively
to
people
who
flunk
physicals.
thank
you.
