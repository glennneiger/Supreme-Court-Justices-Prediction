we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
number
144,
griffin
and
others
against
breckenridge.
mr.
pollak
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
mr.
pollak
i’m
sure
i
need
not
--
there’s
no
requirement
under
the
procedures
of
the
court
that
you
use
the
entire
amount
of
time
allocated
here
by
as
to
all
counsel,
we’ve
allocated
two
hours
here
but
the
important
case
of
the
issues
are
relatively
narrow.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
pollak,
what
if
these
were
five
law
school
students,
all
white
from
michigan
or
minnesota,
how
would
that
affect
arguments
you’re
making.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
then
you’ve
emphasize
too
that
the
belief
of
the
attackers
was
mistaken
and
these
passengers
were
not
engaged
in
any
such
enterprise
as
the
attackers
up
there
were
engaged
in
--
and
what
if
you
didn't
like
them
a
little
bit
--
what
difference
would
that
make?
whether
they
were
mistaken
or
not
mistaken?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
–
others
not
in
the
car.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you’d
been
making
the
same
argument
i
just
take
it
if
a
band
of
people
have
picketed
a
theater
or
a
restaurant,
some
public
accommodation
for
the
purpose
of
keeping
one
class
of
people
from
having
access
to
that
restaurant.
would
you
say
that’s
a
violation
and
of
the
same
kind
you’re
urging
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
pollack.
mr.
wallace,
you’ll
just
have
time
to
play
a
foundation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
that
tie
you
down
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
limit
to
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
wallace?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
are
many
ways
of
getting
it
back,
aren’t
there?
any
other
ways
than
relying
on
a
statute
of
this
kind
to
reach
the
hypothetical
you
just
suggested?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i'm
speaking
federal.
aren't
there
many
other
federal
remedies
for
the
hypothetical?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
[voice
overlap]
federal
statue
about
obstructing
justice?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
your
hypothetical
is
altered
a
little
bit
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
suggest
a
hypothetical
that
takes
us
away
from
immediate
context
for
a
minute
and
see
if
sheds
any
light
for
me
on
problem.
suppose
in
some
community,
a
new
church
was
started,
a
church
that
was
found
offensive
to
great
many
of
people
living
there
and
they
--
in
one
way
or
another
by
picketing,
by
threats,
intimidation
banded
together,
more
than
three
of
them
to
prevent
the
worshipers
of
that
group,
i
mean,
nothing
to
do
with
negro
and
white
problems,
to
prevent
the
worshipers
of
that
new
unpopular
sect
from
exercising
their
right
to
free
exercise
of
religion.
would
you
think
that
would
be
covered
by
the
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
agree
mr.
wallace
that
had
this
case,
this
case
gone
to
trial
or
one
might,
that
there
is
a
certain
obligation
on
the
plaintiff
to
prove
the
existence
of
a
conspiracy
than
just
conduct
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
presumably,
if
the
legislation
took
the
course
of
most
conspiracy
based
cases,
it
would
have
to
call
on
the
defendants
for
testimony.
suppose
these
defendants
just
decline
to
testify
on
fifth
amendment
grounds
and
no
other
testimony
about
a
conspiracy
was
forthcoming
except
such
as
the
plaintiffs
might
offer
by
way
of
their
own
conclusions?
that
would
probably
would
you
agree
that
that
will
lead
to
a
directed
verdict
very
likely?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
think
when
two
men
attack
two
other
men
or
one
other
that
your
conduct
alone
would
establish
a
case
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that
means
it
would
be
equally
direct
towards
establishing
some
other,
some
criminal
conduct,
wouldn't
it,
a
state
criminal
conduct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
i
was
getting
out
in
part
at
least
was
that
you
probably
could
have
the
cases
where
enormous
damages
could
be
shown,
but
the
case
might
fail
because
of
want
of
evidence
of
the
conspiracy.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
might
either
by
the
action
of
the
triers
or
it
might
be
by
action
of
the
court?
i
just
want
to
separate
the
proof
of
the
conspiracy
from
the
proof
of
the
damages.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
wallace.
mr.
moore?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say
their
rights
would
be
violated,
you
mean
the
rights
under
the
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
mr.
moore,
assuming
for
the
moment
that
the
allegations
of
this
complaint
wherein
a
complaint
in
an
action
in
the
state
court
with
all
other
jurisdictions
unquestioned,
would
there
be
any
doubt
if
they
had
asserted
a
tort
action
against
the
defendants
if
the
allegations
are
correct
and
they
can
support
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
couldn't
be
much
question
about
that,
could
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that
hasn't
been
tried
yet?
chief
