mr.
w.
d.
moore
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
alleged
that
on
july
2,
1966
which
happened
to
be
a
sunday
afternoon,
the
claimants
in
this
cause
were
traveling
down
a
public
road
and
they
were
intercepted
by
the
respondents
in
this
cause
and
the
confrontations
occurred,
whereby
this
alleged
that
an
assault
was
made
and
some
physical
damages
down
to
the
petitioners.
and
as
a
result
from
that,
the
petitioners
filed
their
suit
in
the
state
court
of
kemper
county,
mississippi.
that
case
is
still
pending.
it
hasn't
been
tried,
but
anyways
on
the
dockets
still
pending.
they
also
filed
a
complaint
in
the
eastern
division
of
the
southern
districts
of
mississippi
federal
jurisdiction,
and
the
cause
came
on
to
be
heard
upon
the
motion
of
the
respondents
to
dismiss
the
case
because
the
declaration
had
wholly
failed
to
state
a
cause
of
action
in
that
did
not
allege
an
action
under
color
of
law.
the
decision
of
the
district
judge
was
appealed
to
the
fifth
circuit
of
the
fifth
district
and
the
circuit
court
affirmed
the
ruling
of
the
district
judge,
holding
that
there
had
been
no
action
to
alleged
damages
committed
under
the
color
of
law,
and
then
the
case
was
appealed
to
this
body
and
we
here
today
for
that.
mr.
w.
d.
moore
thank
you,
mr.
justice.
the
only
issue
as
i
see
it
to
be
determined
by
this
court
is
further
the
lower
court
was
correct
in
affirming
and
dismissing
the
cause
of
action
because
it
failed
to
state
that
the
alleged
acts
were
committed
under
the
color
of
law.
now,
this
court
has
settled
the
matter
in
my
opinion
in
collins
versus
hardyman
and
some
of
the
members
of
this
court
was
here
from
the
case
was
recited.
what
we
have
allegedly
is
that
these
people
were
grievously
treated
if
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
are
correct
and
that
their
rights
would
be
violated,
but
it
is
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
the
collins
versus
hardyman
--
mr.
w.
d.
moore
their
individual
rights;
not
the
rights
under
the
law.
mr.
w.
d.
moore
i
think
mr.
justice
that
i'm
speaking
of
the
equality
of
the
right
under
the
law.
mr.
w.
d.
moore
no
sir
--
i
didn't
express
myself
correctly.
i
was
reading
--
trying
to
read
from
collins
versus
hardyman.
mr.
w.
d.
moore
under
the
state?
i
believe
mr.
chief
justice
that
it
would
state
a
tort
action
--
mr.
w.
d.
moore
no
sir.
well,
as
matter
of
fact
as
i
said
before,
they
have
done
that.
there
is
a
case
arising
out
of
the
alleged
facts
in
this
--
in
the
state
court.
mr.
w.
d.
moore
no
sir.
it
was
filed
shortly
after
the
alleged
incident
occurred
and
for
this
reason,
i
don't
know
why
it
hadn't
been
tried,
but
it
had
the
still
on
the
docket.
now,
in
their
case
in
the
state
court,
i
think
they
state
a
cause
of
action.
but
what
this
court
is
concerned
with
and
what
my
own
understanding
is
that
if
the
acts
were
taken
to
be
true,
their
rights
were
certainly
invaded,
disregarded
and
the
law
violated.
but
neither
then
rise,
nor
the
equality
arise
under
the
law
had
been
or
were
intended
to
be
denied
or
unpaid.
now,
that's
position
of
the
respondents
in
this
matter.
now,
reference
has
been
made
to
guest
case
and
the
prize
case
and
they
were
criminal
cases
and
indictment
was
obtained.
and
among
the
other
things
in
the
indictment,
it
was
charged
that
they
committed
these
acts
on
the
color
of
law
and
i
don't
think
that
that
would
be
applicable
to
our
case
here.
mr.
w.
d.
moore
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
d.
moore
yes,
yes
sir.
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
w.
d.
moore
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
d.
moore
that’s
my
understanding
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
d.
moore
i
don’t
know
where
they
used
the
word
interstate,
did
not.
it
said
on
the
local
--
mr.
w.
d.
moore
yes,
i
don't
have
that
before
me
right
now.
mr.
w.
d.
moore
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
d.
moore
well,
i
just
don't
be
frankly
to
mr.
justice
brennan
--
i
mean
mr.
justice
stewart
--
i
don't
know
that
we
have
place
the
defense
in
the
case
of
collins,
and
we
believe
that
it's
a
landmark
case
that
the
issue
has
been
tried
in
settled
by
this
court.
unless
there's
some
further
questions
mr.
chief
justice,
we
rest
our
case
on
collins
versus
hardyman.
thank
you.
