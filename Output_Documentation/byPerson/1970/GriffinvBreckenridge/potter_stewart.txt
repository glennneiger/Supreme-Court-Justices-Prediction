what
was
--
was
grady
white
or
a
negro?
justice
potter
stewart
the
passengers
were
negro?
justice
potter
stewart
the
breckenridge’s
are
white
man?
justice
potter
stewart
they’re
brothers?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
journeys
–
while
i
have
interrupted
you
was
all
within
one
state,
was
it
not,
the
driving
around
on
the
highways.
justice
potter
stewart
was
to
travel
itself
with
all--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
pollak,
perhaps
i
would
disturb
you
if
i
said
that
i
share
the
same
difficulty
mr.
justice
white
has
expressed.
can
you
pinpoint
in
a
few
words
just
what
right
you’ve
spoken
in
general
terms
of
rights?
just
what
right
these
people
were
deprived
of
sad
as
the
circumstances
were?
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
it?
is
it
a
right
not
to
be
beaten
up
or
is
it
a
right
to
enjoy
life
undisturbed
by
a
conspiracy
of
this
kind?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
mr.
justice
white
referred
to
his
being
beaten
up
and
i
would
assume
this
would
take
more
than
one
individual
to
do.
would
it
apply
to
him,
this
argument
that
you’re
making
under
those
circumstances?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
this
is
why
i
made
that
assumption.
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
why
i
made
that
assumption.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
would
the
justice
have
a
federal
cause
of
action
under
1985.
justice
potter
stewart
well
this
is
coming
clear
now
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
pollak,
is
there
any
question
that
congress
in
just
a
straight
forward
way
could
pass
a
valid
law
preventing
interference
with
the
movement
on
the
highways?
justice
potter
stewart
real
(inaudible)
over
here
is
the
first
part
of
1983.
justice
potter
stewart
because
the
interference
with
the
federal
right
as
the
endresult
of
the
overt
acts,
made
an
interference
with
movement
on
the
highway
which
as
this
could
easily
be.
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
be
easy.
justice
potter
stewart
that
not
so
easy
because
your,
so
far
as
section
5
is
concerned,
the
privilege
of
the
2849
section
5
is
limited
by
the
qualification
state
actions
directly
to
the
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
why
is
that
so
easy
as
it
seems--
well,
moving
on
the
highways
doesn’t
come
from
that.
justice
potter
stewart
the
guest
case
itself.
justice
potter
stewart
--
is
a
square
precedent
for
that,
that
the
right
of
interstate
travel
doesn’t
necessarily
derived
from
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
really
the
question?
justice
potter
stewart
it
couldn’t
be
read
as
including
the
rights
of
national
citizenship.
justice
potter
stewart
wouldn’t
you
think
this
would
apply
to
traveling?
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
source
of
congressional
power?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
the
difference
is
that
in
jones,
there
was
a
explicit
language
about
buying
and
selling
property
real
in
person?
justice
potter
stewart
was
with
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
my
only
difficulty
because
i
have
many
in
this
case,
with
the
statutory
language.
it's
certain
difficult
for
me
at
first
blush
at
least
to
see
how
it
covers
this
case
where
the
facts
were
that
two
brothers
who
were
in
the
wild
race
crashed
their
car
into
another
car
and
beat
up
the
five
occupants
of
the
other
car.
now,
without
mistaken
--
mistaken
belief
that
one
of
the
five
was
the
civil
--
justice
potter
stewart
whenever
two
white
men
beat
up
a
negro
man
a
suit
under
the
statute
could
be
brought,
if
they
beat
them
up
because
were
negroes,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
alleged,
alleged?
justice
potter
stewart
and
now,
what
is
the
more,
what's
the
more?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
this
is
true
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
this
is
true
when
two
or
more
white
men
beat
up
one
or
more
negro
men
because
they
are
negroes?
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
obviously,
they're
not
going
to
be
able
to
walk
down
the
street?
justice
potter
stewart
because
they
are
negroes
--
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
that's
covered
by
language
of
the
statute,
do
you?
you
obviously
do
or
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
gave
us
one
good
example
of
what
it
might
mean
and
that
is
keeping
negro
children
away
from
desegregated
public
school.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
this
vis-a-vis
the
state
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
fourteenth
amendment
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
only
upon
the
state,
you
would
agree
with
that,
wouldn't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
against
the
state?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
except
that
when
you
have
a
court
order
which
you
hypothesized?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
should
agree
that
might
be
covered
by
the
statute,
but
we're
talking
what's
your
case?
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
order
to
have
rights
it
seems
to
me,
it
has
to
be
under
the
law.
that's
what
rights
and
obligations
are
all
about
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
you're
talking
about
right
under
tort
law
in
mississippi?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
guest
case
there,
it
was
two
branches,
i'm
talking
now
about
the
opinion
of
the
court,
not
concurring
opinions.
one
branch
of
it
was
that
there
was
a
officially
a
state
action.
justice
potter
stewart
but
quite
a
separate
and
distinct
second
branch
of
the
case
was
that
there
was
private
action
interfering
with
a
right
that
congress
had
the
constitutional
power
to
protect;
that
was
the
right
of
interstate
travel.
do
you
remember,
have
you
read
the
guest
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
as
to
that
second
branch,
it
was
explicitly,
perhaps
not
clearly
held,
but
explicitly
held
that
there
need
not
be
state
involvement
when
the
federal
right
interfered
with
is
the
right
of
interstate
travel
because
that
is
a
right
that
does
not
derive
necessarily
from
the
fourteenth
amendment.
that's
the
right
that
congress
can
protect
against
interference
by
private
action.
justice
potter
stewart
so
to
that
extend,
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
guest
doesn't
require
color
of
law
or
state
involvement
in
any
way
when
the
federal
right
interfered
with
is
the
right
of
interstate
travel,
i'm
i
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
there's
an
allegation
here
about
traveling
freely
down
the
interstate
highway
isn’t
there?
justice
potter
stewart
and
of
course
the
guest
case
which
perhaps
for
the
first
time
made
it
explicit
that
the
right
of
interstate
travel
was
a
right
that
congress
had
the
power
to
protect
not
only
against
state
interference,
but
also
against
private
interference.
that
holding
that
it
was
in
the
guest
case
which
came
after
collins
against
hardyman
didn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
wonder
if
you
think
that
has
any
significance
or
that
--
since
that
was
the
right
that
which
had
not
been
crystallized
or
made
clear
to
time
of
the
decision
on
collins
against
hardyman?
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
--
was
grady
white
or
a
negro?
justice
potter
stewart
the
passengers
were
negro?
justice
potter
stewart
the
breckenridge’s
are
white
man?
justice
potter
stewart
they’re
brothers?
justice
