mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
a
racially
motivated
assault
on
a
public
highway.
it
presents
questions
as
to
the
reach
and
the
constitutionality
of
the
civil
provision
of
section
2
of
the
1871
ku
klux
klan
act
now
in
section
1985
(3)
of
title
42.
the
particular
terms
that
the
case
focuses
on
that
statute
read
and
they’re
quoted
at
page
3
of
the
petitioner’s
white
brief.
if
two
or
more
persons
conspire
for
the
purpose
of
depriving
either
directly
or
indirectly
any
person
or
class
of
persons
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
or
the
of
equal
privileges
and
immunities
under
the
laws
and
whether
is
injury
or
a
deprivation,
a
civil
cause
for
damages
is
created.
the
particular
issues
as
we
see
them
are
two,
whether
this
section
1985
(3)
reaches
a
conspiracy
of
private
citizens
to
prevent
persons
and
class
of
persons
on
account
of
their
race
from
seeking
equal
protection
of
the
laws
and
from
enjoying
equal
rights,
privileges
and
immunities
under
federal
and
state
laws.
now,
if
the
statute
reads,
as
we
believe
an
urge
that
it
be
read
then
the
court
has
before
it
a
question
of
power
whether
section
2
of
the
ku
klux
klan
act
was
within
the
powers
of
the
congress.
let
me
state
briefly
the
facts
which
arise
on
demur
as
the
district
court
dismissed
the
petitioner’s
complaint.
one
r
g
grady
of
memphis,
tennessee
was
driving
his
car
in
kipper
county
mississippi,
and
had
his
passengers
four
young
negro
men.
he’s
driving
on
a
federal
state
on
local
highways.
the
period
was
--
or
the
day
was
july
2,
1966.
two
other
men,
the
breckenridge’s,
white
conspired
to
drive
their
pick
up
truck
in
the
path
of
the
grady
car.
they
were
in
the
mistaken
belief
that
grady
was
a
civil
rights
worker.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
don’t
know
but
i
have
closely
read
everything
in
--
that
i
could
lay
my
hands
on
and
i
believe
through
this
reading
that
grady
was
also
negro.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
passengers
were
all
negro.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
breckenridges
are
white
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes
brothers.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that’s
right.
the
allegation
is
that
they’re
on
some
of
these
federal
highways,
state
and
local
highways.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
no
allegation
that
they
went
beyond
in
this
travel,
the
state
of
mississippi.
the
purpose
of
the
conspiracy
was
to
deprive
the
petitioners
of
exercise
and
enjoyment
of
equal
rights,
equal
privileges
and
immunities
under
mississippi
laws
and
under
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states.
the
conspiracy
was
carried
out,
the
breckenridges
using
guns,
clubs
proceeded
to
threaten
and
beat
the
riders
in
the
car
and
with
injuries
and
thereby
so
the
complaint
alleges
depriving
them
of
rights
including
rights
to
travel
on
federal
highways,
rights
to
petition,
rights
to
movement
and
a
series
of
rights
set
forth
particularly
in
the
complaint.
the
occupants
of
the
car
initiated
this
action.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
case,
the
claim
on
a
motion
on
grounds
that
there
was
no
allegation
that
the
action
was
other
than
by
purely
private
citizens.
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed.
it
did
so
in
its
words
reluctantly
feeling
bound
by
the
decision
of
this
court
in
collins
v.
hardyman
and
the
opinion
of
judge
goldberg
states
that
the
court
would
not
be
surprised
if
collins
were
disapproved
and
section
1985
(3)
were
held
to
embrace
private
conspiracies.
in
our
argument
before
your
honors,
we
urge
first
that
section
1985
be
given
the
scope
which
we
see
in
its
words
and
its
legislative
history
to
reach
purely
private
conspiracies.
the
persons
not
acting
under
color
of
law
aimed
at
depriving
others
of
rights
afforded
by
federal
and
state
citizenship,
where
the
conspiracy
and
the
deprivation
has
a
purpose
because
of
the
membership
of
those
victims
in
a
class.
here,
the
class
is
the
racial
class.
it’s
a
racial
conspiracy
to
deprive
these
negroes
and
other
negroes
of
the
exercise
of
the
rights
afforded
them
by
federal
and
state
law.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
we
would
believe
that
our
argument
rests
on
their
membership
in
a
definable
class,
the
object
of
the
conspiracy
being
to
vent
itself
on
the
enjoyment
by
that
class
or
the
members
of
the
class
of
their
rights.
now,
we
would
not
--
we’re
confronted
here
with
a
race
case
and
the
court
has
indicated
that
it
will
decide
constitutional
questions
on
the
facts
of
the
particular
case
but
we
would
not
say
to
the
court
that
there
could
not
be
a
class
beyond
race,
where
it
is
a
definable
class.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
we
would
--
we
do
not
know
whether
the
occupants
of
the
car
were
engaged
in
activities
of
the
nature
of
a
civil
rights
activity.
the
only
statement
that
the
record
shows
is
that
the
breckenridge’s
had
a
mistaken
belief
that
grady
was
a
civil
rights
worker.
the
record
before
the
court
does
state
that
these
particular
negroes
and
other
negro
americans
were
deprived
of
the
exercise
of
rights,
were
intimidated
from
the
exercise
of
a
matter
of
rights.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
those
in
the
car
and
others
not
in
the
car.
yes
sir
and
that
that
was
the
object
of
this
conspiracy.
it
was
occurred
at
approximately
that
a
month
after
the
meredith
march
where
we
know
those
were
times
of
the
tension
and
movement,
freedom
of
movement
indeed
was
the
purpose
of
the
meredith
march.
the
objective
of
an
individual
of
the
negro
race
being
able
to
walk
from
memphis
to
jackson
without
fear
and
we
know
what
occurred.
but
we
would
see
1985
(3)
has
formed
by
the
congress
in
1871
at
the
time,
when
it
was
concerned
with
private
action
developing
conspiracies
which
had
as
their
objective,
the
limitation
of
newly
won
rights
and
exercise
and
enjoyment
of
newly
won
rights
by
the
recently
freed
negro
slaves
and
that
that
purpose
finds
expression
in
1985
and
would
find
this
case
right
at
the
heart
of
the
concern
of
the
congress
in
drafting
the
statute.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well.
we
would
not
read
the
power
of
the
congress
in
section
5.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
the
construction
as
we
understand
it,
is
that
the
statute
reaches
the
enjoyment
of
these
rights.
in
other
words
there
are
two
sides
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
when
the
individual
is
beaten
up
because
of
his
class,
he
and
his
class
are
denied
the
equal
enjoyment,
the
equal
exercise
of
the
right.
in
other
words,
the
right
doesn’t
exist.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
the
right
afforded
by
the
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
if
you
-
if
an
individual
is
a
subject
of
an
assault,
we
do
not
urge
and
we
don’t
think
congress
drafted
1985
to
reach
that
case.
he
is
not
being
deprived
of
an
equal
right
which
he
enjoys.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that’s
right.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
if
he
is
beaten
up
by
more
than
one
person
who
engaged
in
that
action
in
order
to
prevent
him
from
exercising
that
right
which
he
has
from
the
state,
we
think
that
is
what
the
congress
meant
in
1985
or
section
2
of
the
ku
klux
klan.
that
is
that,
he
was
denied
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
he
had
no
right
to
exercise
when
it
was
trenched
upon
by
the
conspiracy.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
the
--
we’re
focusing
on
a
claim
where
there
are
series
of
rights
which
the
citizens
have
from
the
state
and
from
the
federal
government.
in
order
to
exercise
to
enjoy
those
rights
and
the
clerk
use
those
particular
terms
in
ex
parte
virginia
right
after
the
enactment
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
these
statute,
the
citizens
must
not
be
intimidated
from
or
prevented
from
enjoying
those
rights.
this
statue
is
directed
to
preclude
the
acts
of
individuals
which
would
interpose
their
actions,
their
conspiracy
between
the
right
and
the
citizen’s
enjoyment
of
the
right
and
they
would
make
that
interposition
because
of
the
citizen’s
race.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
we
endeavored
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well
we
--
of
course
we
have
a
racial
case
here
in
united
states
v.
price,
the
court
said
that
it
did
not
need
to
circumscribe
the
outer
reaches
of
the
statute,
it
could
focus
on
what
the
coverage
was
in
a
particular
case
before
it.
here
we
have
a
race
case.
the
first
issue
that
we
considered
the
court
has
before
it
is
what
the
congress
intended
to
reach
in
1985.
this
is
the
position,
the
court
took
in
collins
that
the
congress
intended
to
reach
or
in
fact
did
reach
only
conspiracies
under
color
of
law.
now,
we
think
the
legislative
history,
the
words
and
indeed
the
positions
taken
by
this
court
are
in
the
way
of
the
decision
of
the
court,
the
reading
of
the
statute
in
the
collins
case.
congress
in
the
1866,
1870
and
1871
statutes
as
this
court
has
just
been
reviewing
in
the
dickey
case
and
then
the
arizona
v.
united
states
case,
congress
knew
well,
how
to
distinguish
between
actions
under
color
of
law
and
purely
private
actions.
it
did
so
in
the
various
sections
of
the
1866
act,
it
did
so
in
the
1870
act
and
it
did
so
here.
and
in
this
1871
act,
section
1
of
the
act,
a
civil
section
which
is
now
1983,
congress
used
the
words
under
color
of
law
and
in
section
2,
congress
omitted
those
words.
we
think
that
it’s
clear
from
its
use
of
the
words
and
from
the
background
legislative
history
that
it
drew
section
1
to
reach
actions
of
a
single
person
under
color
of
law
which
denied
rights
and
that
section
2
was
drawn
to
reach
purely
private
conspiracies
which
had
as
their
objective,
the
deprivation
of
equal
rights
and
equal
privileges
and
immunities.
and
we
believe
that
the
court
--
we
believe
that
the
congress
is
sensitive
to
the
questions
which
were
part
of
the
debate.
mr.
justice
white
raises
that
the
congress
included
the
word
equal
with
the
sensitivity
that
what
it
was
concerned
with,
what
it
directed
the
statute
to
reach
was
group
conduct,
a
conspiracy
which
was
aimed
at
denying
a
class
of
persons
because
of
the
membership
in
the
class
of
the
equal
rights.
the
congressman
who
introduced
the
amendment
that
added
the
equal,
congressman
shellabarger
explained
this
use
of
the
term.
and
we
think
his
words
have
meaning
and
understanding
the
reach
of
the
statute.
he
said
the
objective
of
the
amendment
is
to
confine
the
authority
of
the
law
to
prevention
of
deprivations
which
shall
attack
the
equality
of
rights
of
american
citizens.
that
any
violation
of
the
right,
the
animus
and
effective
which
is
to
strike
down
the
citizen,
to
the
end
that
he
may
not
enjoy
equality
of
the
rights
has
contrasted
with
his
and
other
citizens
rights
shall
be
within
the
scope
of
the
remedies.
that’s
at
page
476
of
the
(inaudible).
i
don’t
know
that
i
need
dwell
on
the
reach
of
the
statute
to
purely
private
action.
the
court
rather
directly
after
the
1871
act
in
the
harris
case
read
the
statute
as
reaching
purely
private
action.
mr.
justice
harlan
and
mr.
justice
stewart
in
their
concurrence
in
monroe
v.
pape
in
1961
gave
it
that
reading,
in
dcikey
just
six
months
ago,
mr.
justice
harlan
makes
a
similar
expression
in
two
footnotes,
mr.
justice
brennan
in
concurrence
and
partial
dissent
states
that
he
believes
collins
is
no
longer
but
law
and
that
the
reach
of
the
statute
to
purely
private
actions
is
clear.
and
similar
decisions
of
this
court
with
respect
to
the
language
of
section
241
of
the
criminal
statutes
would
recognize
and
does
recognize
the
words
if
two
or
more
persons
conspire
as
reaching
purely
private
action.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes.
well,
your
honor,
we
do
not
see
the
case.
as
raising
a
question
whether
they
were
deprived
solely
of
a
right
which
they
have
by
the
force
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
alone.
we
see
the
enactment
of
the
congress
as
going
beyond
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
making
it
a
civil
cause
of
action
where
persons
conspire
to
deprive
the
individual
of
the
enjoyment
of
his
rights
under
state
law.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
we
would
state
it
as
a
right
to
enjoy
as
an
equal
participant,
the
civil
society
and
not
to
be
the
object
of
conspiracies
which
aim
to
limit
the
enjoyment
of
that
2209
of
rights
which
the
citizen
has
as
a
member
of
that
society.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
it
would
of
course,
it
would
only
apply
where
there
were
more
than
one
individual
to
participate.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
pardon.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
individuals
would
have
to
have
a
specific
intent
to
assault
in
order
to
limit
the
enjoyment
of
rights.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i’m
leaving
aside
the
fact
that
he’s
a
member
of
the
federal
judiciary,
there
might
be
a
purpose
to
limit
his
actions
in
that
scope,
if
he
is
merely
assaulted
by
two
men,
we
would
not
think
he
would
have
recalled
this.
if
we
lay
upon
top
of
that,
that
the
two
men
wished
to
limit
his
enjoyment
of
society,
we
would
still
think
he
has
a
cause,
if
you
lay
on
top
of
that,
that
they
attack
him
because
of
his
membership
in
a
class,
definable
class,
we
would
think
that
then
there
is
a
cause
under
1985.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
we
think
that
this
is
what
the
congress
meant
in
framing
the
statute
to
use
the
terms
equal
protection
of
the
laws
and
equal
privileges
and
immunities,
equal
to
others.
now,
then
we
believe,
may
it
please
the
court
that
the
scope
of
the
statute
has
to
the
rights
protected
is
also
clear.
congress
had
in
mind
not
only
federal
rights,
federal
constitution
rights
of
national
citizens
but
also
rights
flowing
from
the
state.
and
that
this
reflects
itself
in
the
words
of
the
statute.
it
does
not
say
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states
as
to
other
provisions
of
the
laws
enacted
in
that
1860
period.
it
says,
under
the
laws,
so
we
see
the
possible
sources
of
power
of
the
statute
as
being
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
section
2
of
the
thirteenth
amendment
and
--
off
to
recognized
power
of
the
congress
to
make
enactments
aimed
at
protecting
rights
of
federal
citizens
power
which
the
court
has
recognized
in
various
decisions,
yarbrough,
logan,
woodell
and
--
off
to
recognized
primary
statutory
fault
of
power
that
the
congress
was
looking
toward
is
of
course
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
front
piece
of
the
statute
states
that
it
was
enacted
to
enforce
the
provisions
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
for
other
purposes.
so
we
think
that
the
sources
of
power
can
be
the
fourteenth
and
other
sources
but
we
would
look
initially
at
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
at
section
5.
indeed,
the
court
is
aware
that
it
was
the
question
in
mr.
justice
jackson’s
framing
of
the
opinion
in
collins,
question
of
whether
there
was
power
to
make
this
enactment
that
led
him
to
circumscribe
the
reach
of
the
statute
in
order
--
i
think
it’s
fair
to
say
to
save
what
he
considered
to
be
a
very
difficult
constitutional
question.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
we
state
in
the
brief
mr.
justice
harlan
that
you
do
have
to
overrule.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
we
think
that
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
collins
doesn’t
--
when
read
sympathetically
that
justice
doesn’t
really
say
that
this
was
all
congress
was
seeking
to
do.
i
think
in,
mine
with
several
decisions
of
the
court,
he’s
saying
this
is
all
we
can
see
that
was
constitutional
that
they
did
do.
and
we
think
since
collins
was
decided,
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
crossed
several
of
the
then
considered
extremely
difficult
constitutional
issues.
katzenbach
v.
morgan
has
said
that
the
enforcement
clauses
as
has
jones,
and
as
has
south
carolina
v.
katzenbach
that
the
enforcement
clauses
of
the
reconstruction
amendments
are
positive
grounds
of
power.
and
as
mr.
justice
stewart
stated
in
the
concurring
and
dissenting
opinion
in
the
arizona
case,
that
the
congress
may
embroider
the
rights
set
forth
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
was
there
under
consideration.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
don’t
think
there’s
any
question
it
could,
on
an
interstate
highway
–
the
powers
of
the
congress
to
protect
what
are
referred
to
as
the
rights
of
the
national
citizens.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
real,
the
toughest
issue
is
the
part
that
addresses
itself
to
the
equal
protection
of
laws.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that’s
right.
it
could
be--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
probably.
most
likely
movement
on
the
highway
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes
but
your
honor--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
i
was
addressing
the
–
endeavored
to
respond
to
the
question
in
light
of
crandall
v.
nevada
and
the
right
of
--
right
flowing
from
what
the
--
what
they
have
referred
to
as
the
essence
of
the
federal
union.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
the
guest
case
itself.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
no,
there
are
--
the
congress
was
clearly
thinking
of
the
rights
of
national
citizenship,
rights
under
the
thirteenth
amendment
and
fourteenth
amendments
when
it
drafted
section
1985
and
1871.
but
we
think,
in
our
brief
recall
forth
the
opinions
of
six
members
of
the
court
in
guest
which
state
that
the
congress
has
power
under
the
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
reach
purely
private
action.
purely
private
conspiracies,
but
you’re
aimed
that
denying
equal
access
to
public
facilities.
indeed
there
are
statements
there
that
are
broader
than
them.
and
we
would
call
that
power
forth
as
a
basis
for
the
statute
which
the
congress
has
enacted
and
which
this
court
has
asked
in
this
case
to
address
its
constitutionality.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
we
would
say
that
if
the
picketing
was
part
of
--
that
you’d
have
probably
several
sources
to
reach
the
picketing
that
would
be
a
right
of
national
citizenship
but
if
the
picketers
are
addressing
a
deprivation
of
rights
of
negroes
for
example,
we
would
say
that
that
was
a
denial
of
equal
protection
and
it
would
be
reached
by
the
statute,
yes
we
would
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
a
racially
motivated
assault
on
a
public
highway.
it
presents
questions
as
to
the
reach
and
the
constitutionality
of
the
civil
provision
of
section
2
of
the
1871
ku
klux
klan
act
now
in
section
1985
(3)
of
title
42.
the
particular
terms
that
the
case
focuses
on
that
statute
read
and
they’re
quoted
at
page
3
of
the
petitioner’s
white
brief.
if
two
or
more
persons
conspire
for
the
purpose
of
depriving
either
directly
or
indirectly
any
person
or
class
of
persons
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
or
the
of
equal
privileges
and
immunities
under
the
laws
and
whether
is
injury
or
a
deprivation,
a
civil
cause
for
damages
is
created.
the
particular
issues
as
we
see
them
are
two,
whether
this
section
1985
(3)
reaches
a
conspiracy
of
private
citizens
to
prevent
persons
and
class
of
persons
on
account
of
their
race
from
seeking
equal
protection
of
the
laws
and
from
enjoying
equal
rights,
privileges
and
immunities
under
federal
and
state
laws.
now,
if
the
statute
reads,
as
we
believe
an
urge
that
it
be
read
then
the
court
has
before
it
a
question
of
power
whether
section
2
of
the
ku
klux
klan
act
was
within
the
powers
of
the
congress.
let
me
state
briefly
the
facts
which
arise
on
demur
as
the
district
court
dismissed
the
petitioner’s
complaint.
one
r
g
grady
of
memphis,
tennessee
was
driving
his
car
in
kipper
county
mississippi,
and
had
his
passengers
four
young
negro
men.
he’s
driving
on
a
federal
state
on
local
highways.
the
period
was
--
or
the
day
was
july
2,
1966.
two
other
men,
the
breckenridge’s,
white
conspired
to
drive
their
pick
up
truck
in
the
path
of
the
grady
car.
they
were
in
the
mistaken
belief
that
grady
was
a
civil
rights
worker.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
don’t
know
but
i
have
closely
read
everything
in
--
that
i
could
lay
my
hands
on
and
i
believe
through
this
reading
that
grady
was
also
negro.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
passengers
were
all
negro.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
breckenridges
are
white
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes
brothers.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that’s
right.
the
allegation
is
that
they’re
on
some
of
these
federal
highways,
state
and
local
highways.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
no
allegation
that
they
went
beyond
in
this
travel,
the
state
of
mississippi.
the
purpose
of
the
conspiracy
was
to
deprive
the
petitioners
of
exercise
and
enjoyment
of
equal
rights,
equal
privileges
and
immunities
under
mississippi
laws
and
under
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states.
the
conspiracy
was
carried
out,
the
breckenridges
using
guns,
clubs
proceeded
to
threaten
and
beat
the
riders
in
the
car
and
with
injuries
and
thereby
so
the
complaint
alleges
depriving
them
of
rights
including
rights
to
travel
on
federal
highways,
rights
to
petition,
rights
to
movement
and
a
series
of
rights
set
forth
particularly
in
the
complaint.
the
occupants
of
the
car
initiated
this
action.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
case,
the
claim
on
a
motion
on
grounds
that
there
was
no
allegation
that
the
action
was
other
than
by
purely
private
citizens.
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed.
it
did
so
in
its
words
reluctantly
feeling
bound
by
the
decision
of
this
court
in
collins
v.
hardyman
and
the
opinion
of
judge
goldberg
states
that
the
court
would
not
be
surprised
if
collins
were
disapproved
and
section
1985
(3)
were
held
to
embrace
private
conspiracies.
in
our
argument
before
your
honors,
we
urge
first
that
section
1985
be
given
the
scope
which
we
see
in
its
words
and
its
legislative
history
to
reach
purely
private
conspiracies.
the
persons
not
acting
under
color
of
law
aimed
at
depriving
others
of
rights
afforded
by
federal
and
state
citizenship,
where
the
conspiracy
and
the
deprivation
has
a
purpose
because
of
the
membership
of
those
victims
in
a
class.
here,
the
class
is
the
racial
class.
it’s
a
racial
conspiracy
to
deprive
these
negroes
and
other
negroes
of
the
exercise
of
the
rights
afforded
them
by
federal
and
state
law.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
we
would
believe
that
our
argument
rests
on
their
membership
in
a
definable
class,
the
object
of
the
conspiracy
being
to
vent
itself
on
the
enjoyment
by
that
class
or
the
members
of
the
class
of
their
rights.
now,
we
would
not
--
we’re
confronted
here
with
a
race
case
and
the
court
has
indicated
that
it
will
decide
constitutional
questions
on
the
facts
of
the
particular
case
but
we
would
not
say
to
the
court
that
there
could
not
be
a
class
beyond
race,
where
it
is
a
definable
class.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
we
would
--
we
do
not
know
whether
the
occupants
of
the
car
were
engaged
in
activities
of
the
nature
of
a
civil
rights
activity.
the
only
statement
that
the
record
shows
is
that
the
breckenridge’s
had
a
mistaken
belief
that
grady
was
a
civil
rights
worker.
the
record
before
the
court
does
state
that
these
particular
negroes
and
other
negro
americans
were
deprived
of
the
exercise
of
rights,
were
intimidated
from
the
exercise
of
a
matter
of
rights.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
those
in
the
car
and
others
not
in
the
car.
yes
sir
and
that
that
was
the
object
of
this
conspiracy.
it
was
occurred
at
approximately
that
a
month
after
the
meredith
march
where
we
know
those
were
times
of
the
tension
and
movement,
freedom
of
movement
indeed
was
the
purpose
of
the
meredith
march.
the
objective
of
an
individual
of
the
negro
race
being
able
to
walk
from
memphis
to
jackson
without
fear
and
we
know
what
occurred.
but
we
would
see
1985
(3)
has
formed
by
the
congress
in
1871
at
the
time,
when
it
was
concerned
with
private
action
developing
conspiracies
which
had
as
their
objective,
the
limitation
of
newly
won
rights
and
exercise
and
enjoyment
of
newly
won
rights
by
the
recently
freed
negro
slaves
and
that
that
purpose
finds
expression
in
1985
and
would
find
this
case
right
at
the
heart
of
the
concern
of
the
congress
in
drafting
the
statute.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well.
we
would
not
read
the
power
of
the
congress
in
section
5.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
the
construction
as
we
understand
it,
is
that
the
statute
reaches
the
enjoyment
of
these
rights.
in
other
words
there
are
two
sides
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
when
the
individual
is
beaten
up
because
of
his
class,
he
and
his
class
are
denied
the
equal
enjoyment,
the
equal
exercise
of
the
right.
in
other
words,
the
right
doesn’t
exist.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
the
right
afforded
by
the
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
if
you
-
if
an
individual
is
a
subject
of
an
assault,
we
do
not
urge
and
we
don’t
think
congress
drafted
1985
to
reach
that
case.
he
is
not
being
deprived
of
an
equal
right
which
he
enjoys.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that’s
right.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
if
he
is
beaten
up
by
more
than
one
person
who
engaged
in
that
action
in
order
to
prevent
him
from
exercising
that
right
which
he
has
from
the
state,
we
think
that
is
what
the
congress
meant
in
1985
or
section
2
of
the
ku
klux
klan.
that
is
that,
he
was
denied
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
he
had
no
right
to
exercise
when
it
was
trenched
upon
by
the
conspiracy.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
the
--
we’re
focusing
on
a
claim
where
there
are
series
of
rights
which
the
citizens
have
from
the
state
and
from
the
federal
government.
in
order
to
exercise
to
enjoy
those
rights
and
the
clerk
use
those
particular
terms
in
ex
parte
virginia
right
after
the
enactment
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
these
statute,
the
citizens
must
not
be
intimidated
from
or
prevented
from
enjoying
those
rights.
this
statue
is
directed
to
preclude
the
acts
of
individuals
which
would
interpose
their
actions,
their
conspiracy
between
the
right
and
the
citizen’s
enjoyment
of
the
right
and
they
would
make
that
interposition
because
of
the
citizen’s
race.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
we
endeavored
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well
we
--
of
course
we
have
a
racial
case
here
in
united
states
v.
price,
the
court
said
that
it
did
not
need
to
circumscribe
the
outer
reaches
of
the
statute,
it
could
focus
on
what
the
coverage
was
in
a
particular
case
before
it.
here
we
have
a
race
case.
the
first
issue
that
we
considered
the
court
has
before
it
is
what
the
congress
intended
to
reach
in
1985.
this
is
the
position,
the
court
took
in
collins
that
the
congress
intended
to
reach
or
in
fact
did
reach
only
conspiracies
under
color
of
law.
now,
we
think
the
legislative
history,
the
words
and
indeed
the
positions
taken
by
this
court
are
in
the
way
of
the
decision
of
the
court,
the
reading
of
the
statute
in
the
collins
case.
congress
in
the
1866,
1870
and
1871
statutes
as
this
court
has
just
been
reviewing
in
the
dickey
case
and
then
the
arizona
v.
united
states
case,
congress
knew
well,
how
to
distinguish
between
actions
under
color
of
law
and
purely
private
actions.
it
did
so
in
the
various
sections
of
the
1866
act,
it
did
so
in
the
1870
act
and
it
did
so
here.
and
in
this
1871
act,
section
1
of
the
act,
a
civil
section
which
is
now
1983,
congress
used
the
words
under
color
of
law
and
in
section
2,
congress
omitted
those
words.
we
think
that
it’s
clear
from
its
use
of
the
words
and
from
the
background
legislative
history
that
it
drew
section
1
to
reach
actions
of
a
single
person
under
color
of
law
which
denied
rights
and
that
section
2
was
drawn
to
reach
purely
private
conspiracies
which
had
as
their
objective,
the
deprivation
of
equal
rights
and
equal
privileges
and
immunities.
and
we
believe
that
the
court
--
we
believe
that
the
congress
is
sensitive
to
the
questions
which
were
part
of
the
debate.
mr.
justice
white
raises
that
the
congress
included
the
word
equal
with
the
sensitivity
that
what
it
was
concerned
with,
what
it
directed
the
statute
to
reach
was
group
conduct,
a
conspiracy
which
was
aimed
at
denying
a
class
of
persons
because
of
the
membership
in
the
class
of
the
equal
rights.
the
congressman
who
introduced
the
amendment
that
added
the
equal,
congressman
shellabarger
explained
this
use
of
the
term.
and
we
think
his
words
have
meaning
and
understanding
the
reach
of
the
statute.
he
said
the
objective
of
the
amendment
is
to
confine
the
authority
of
the
law
to
prevention
of
deprivations
which
shall
attack
the
equality
of
rights
of
american
citizens.
that
any
violation
of
the
right,
the
animus
and
effective
which
is
to
strike
down
the
citizen,
to
the
end
that
he
may
not
enjoy
equality
of
the
rights
has
contrasted
with
his
and
other
citizens
rights
shall
be
within
the
scope
of
the
remedies.
that’s
at
page
476
of
the
(inaudible).
i
don’t
know
that
i
need
dwell
on
the
reach
of
the
statute
to
purely
private
action.
the
court
rather
directly
after
the
1871
act
in
the
harris
case
read
the
statute
as
reaching
purely
private
action.
mr.
justice
harlan
and
mr.
justice
stewart
in
their
concurrence
in
monroe
v.
pape
in
1961
gave
it
that
reading,
in
dcikey
just
six
months
ago,
mr.
justice
harlan
makes
a
similar
expression
in
two
footnotes,
mr.
justice
brennan
in
concurrence
and
partial
dissent
states
that
he
believes
collins
is
no
longer
but
law
and
that
the
reach
of
the
statute
to
purely
private
actions
is
clear.
and
similar
decisions
of
this
court
with
respect
to
the
language
of
section
241
of
the
criminal
statutes
would
recognize
and
does
recognize
the
words
if
two
or
more
persons
conspire
as
reaching
purely
private
action.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes.
well,
your
honor,
we
do
not
see
the
case.
as
raising
a
question
whether
they
were
deprived
solely
of
a
right
which
they
have
by
the
force
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
alone.
we
see
the
enactment
of
the
congress
as
going
beyond
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
making
it
a
civil
cause
of
action
where
persons
conspire
to
deprive
the
individual
of
the
enjoyment
of
his
rights
under
state
law.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
we
would
state
it
as
a
right
to
enjoy
as
an
equal
participant,
the
civil
society
and
not
to
be
the
object
of
conspiracies
which
aim
to
limit
the
enjoyment
of
that
2209
of
rights
which
the
citizen
has
as
a
member
of
that
society.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
it
would
of
course,
it
would
only
apply
where
there
were
more
than
one
individual
to
participate.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
pardon.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
individuals
would
have
to
have
a
specific
intent
to
assault
in
order
to
limit
the
enjoyment
of
rights.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i’m
leaving
aside
the
fact
that
he’s
a
member
of
the
federal
judiciary,
there
might
be
a
purpose
to
limit
his
actions
in
that
scope,
if
he
is
merely
assaulted
by
two
men,
we
would
not
think
he
would
have
recalled
this.
if
we
lay
upon
top
of
that,
that
the
two
men
wished
to
limit
his
enjoyment
of
society,
we
would
still
think
he
has
a
cause,
if
you
lay
on
top
of
that,
that
they
attack
him
because
of
his
membership
in
a
class,
definable
class,
we
would
think
that
then
there
is
a
cause
under
1985.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
we
think
that
this
is
what
the
congress
meant
in
framing
the
statute
to
use
the
terms
equal
protection
of
the
laws
and
equal
privileges
and
immunities,
equal
to
others.
now,
then
we
believe,
may
it
please
the
court
that
the
scope
of
the
statute
has
to
the
rights
protected
is
also
clear.
congress
had
in
mind
not
only
federal
rights,
federal
constitution
rights
of
national
citizens
but
also
rights
flowing
from
the
state.
and
that
this
reflects
itself
in
the
words
of
the
statute.
it
does
not
say
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states
as
to
other
provisions
of
the
laws
enacted
in
that
1860
period.
it
says,
under
the
laws,
so
we
see
the
possible
sources
of
power
of
the
statute
as
being
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
section
2
of
the
thirteenth
amendment
and
--
off
to
recognized
power
of
the
congress
to
make
enactments
aimed
at
protecting
rights
of
federal
citizens
power
which
the
court
has
recognized
in
various
decisions,
yarbrough,
logan,
woodell
and
--
off
to
recognized
primary
statutory
fault
of
power
that
the
congress
was
looking
toward
is
of
course
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
front
piece
of
the
statute
states
that
it
was
enacted
to
enforce
the
provisions
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
for
other
purposes.
so
we
think
that
the
sources
of
power
can
be
the
fourteenth
and
other
sources
but
we
would
look
initially
at
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
at
section
5.
indeed,
the
court
is
aware
that
it
was
the
question
in
mr.
justice
jackson’s
framing
of
the
opinion
in
collins,
question
of
whether
there
was
power
to
make
this
enactment
that
led
him
to
circumscribe
the
reach
of
the
statute
in
order
--
i
think
it’s
fair
to
say
to
save
what
he
considered
to
be
a
very
difficult
constitutional
question.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
we
state
in
the
brief
mr.
justice
harlan
that
you
do
have
to
overrule.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
we
think
that
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
collins
doesn’t
--
when
read
sympathetically
that
justice
doesn’t
really
say
that
this
was
all
congress
was
seeking
to
do.
i
think
in,
mine
with
several
decisions
of
the
court,
he’s
saying
this
is
all
we
can
see
that
was
constitutional
that
they
did
do.
and
we
think
since
collins
was
decided,
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
crossed
several
of
the
then
considered
extremely
difficult
constitutional
issues.
katzenbach
v.
morgan
has
said
that
the
enforcement
clauses
as
has
jones,
and
as
has
south
carolina
v.
katzenbach
that
the
enforcement
clauses
of
the
reconstruction
amendments
are
positive
grounds
of
power.
and
as
mr.
justice
stewart
stated
in
the
concurring
and
dissenting
opinion
in
the
arizona
case,
that
the
congress
may
embroider
the
rights
set
forth
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
was
there
under
consideration.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
don’t
think
there’s
any
question
it
could,
on
an
interstate
highway
–
the
powers
of
the
congress
to
protect
what
are
referred
to
as
the
rights
of
the
national
citizens.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
real,
the
toughest
issue
is
the
part
that
addresses
itself
to
the
equal
protection
of
laws.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that’s
right.
it
could
be--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
probably.
most
likely
movement
on
the
highway
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes
but
your
honor--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
i
was
addressing
the
–
endeavored
to
respond
to
the
question
in
light
of
crandall
v.
nevada
and
the
right
of
--
right
flowing
from
what
the
--
what
they
have
referred
to
as
the
essence
of
the
federal
union.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
the
guest
case
itself.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
no,
there
are
--
the
congress
was
clearly
thinking
of
the
rights
of
national
citizenship,
rights
under
the
thirteenth
amendment
and
fourteenth
amendments
when
it
drafted
section
1985
and
1871.
but
we
think,
in
our
brief
recall
forth
the
opinions
of
six
members
of
the
court
in
guest
which
state
that
the
congress
has
power
under
the
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
reach
purely
private
action.
purely
private
conspiracies,
but
you’re
aimed
that
denying
equal
access
to
public
facilities.
indeed
there
are
statements
there
that
are
broader
than
them.
and
we
would
call
that
power
forth
as
a
basis
for
the
statute
which
the
congress
has
enacted
and
which
this
court
has
asked
in
this
case
to
address
its
constitutionality.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
we
would
say
that
if
the
picketing
was
part
of
--
that
you’d
have
probably
several
sources
to
reach
the
picketing
that
would
be
a
right
of
national
citizenship
but
if
the
picketers
are
addressing
a
deprivation
of
rights
of
negroes
for
example,
we
would
say
that
that
was
a
denial
of
equal
protection
and
it
would
be
reached
by
the
statute,
yes
we
would
your
honor.
