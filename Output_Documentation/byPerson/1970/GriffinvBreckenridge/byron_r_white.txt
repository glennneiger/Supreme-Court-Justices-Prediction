mr.
pollak,
i
couldn’t
understand
the
conspiracy
to
interfere
with
say
a
federally
protected
right
like
travel
or
something
like
that.
but
if
it’s
racial
in
1985
(3)
and
you
have
to
have
a
conspiracy
by
two
or
more
people
to
deprive
someone
on
the
equal
protection
of
the
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
do
you
have
a
conspiracy,
how
does
the
conspiracy
to
beat
somebody
up?
how
does
that
involve
the
conspiracy
to
deny
equal
protection
of
the
law
by
the
state.
i
mean
it
is
the
state
that
has
to
deny
protection
of
the
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
the
constitutional
question
at
all,
since
it’s
a
statutory
construction
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
enjoyment
of
what
right
is
interfered
with
in
terms
of
equal
protection
--
provide
the
impeachment.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
the
right
is
only
against
the
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
how
would
my
being
beaten
up,
deprive
me
of
the
right
i
have
against
the
state
not
to
be
discriminated
against.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
is
just
not
being
deprived
equal
protection
of
the

by
the
state.
and
he
has
a
right
--
federal
right
not
to
be
discriminated
against
by
the
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
he
just
gets
beaten
up,
he
is
not
deprived
of
that
right
that
he
has
--
justice
byron
r.
white
or
if
the
right
isn't
even
interfered
with.
justice
byron
r.

i
don’t
see
the
thing
beaten
up
interferes
with
my
right
to
be
equally
protected
under
the

justice
byron

the

the
first
sentence
–actually
there
are
three
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
there
a

white
i
don’t
see
why
you
zero
in
on
the

make
this
exclusively
a
fourteenth
amendment
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
