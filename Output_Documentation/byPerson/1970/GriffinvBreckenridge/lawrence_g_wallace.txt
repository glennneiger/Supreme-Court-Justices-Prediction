mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
wish
first
to
speak
to
the
question
that
was
put
by
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
justice
blackmun.
as
we
see
the
issue
of
what
right
it
is
that
is
being
denied
by
the
private
conduct
here,
i
think
some
insight
into
the
answer
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
why
is
there
a
violation
of
--
why
is
there
a
deprivation
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
that
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
we
agree
with
mr.
pollak
that
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
as
used
in
both
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
there’s
no
reason
to
read
it
differently
in
this
statute,
embraces
enjoyment
of
the
rights
that
are
guaranteed
as
against
the
state
and
the
question
is
how
is
this
conspiracy
interfered
with
that
one
of
those
rights
that
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that’s
correct.
the
rights
that
are
guaranteed
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
against
the
state,
that
as
i
understood
it
was
the
question.
that
was
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct
and
which
includes
the
right
to
enjoyment
of
that
guarantee
as
against
the
states.
this
was
held
as
far
back
as
ex
parte
virginia
in
strauder
against
west
virginia.
it’s
not
merely
the
abstract
right
as
against
the
state
but
it’s
a
right
to
enjoyment.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
could
be
read
that
way.
we’ve
expressed
some
difficulty
on
the
facts
of
this
case
about
tying
in
the
allegations
of
this
complaint
with
what
has
traditionally
been
denominated
one
of
the
rights
of
national
citizenship.
but
i
think
it’s
instructive
to
see
our
position
to
look
at
the
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it’s
a
statutory
case,
and
the
terms
of
the
statute
that
are
the
issue
here
are
identical
to
the
terms
used
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it’s
been
interpreted
to
a
fact
that
guarantee,
yes
but
the
words
aren’t
there
mr.
justice
and
the
words
that
were
used
here
are
words
that
were
used
contemporaneously
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
though
that
was
the
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
as
i
say,
it’s
a
statutory
case
but
obviously
the
words
of
the
statute
have
a
background
in
the
purpose
of
the
congress
that
adopted
the
thirteenth,
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments
and
contemporaneously
used
the
same
words
and
this
after
all
was
denominated
by
that
congress
enact
for
enforcement
of
--
for
the
purpose
of
enforcing
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
for
other
purposes.
we
say
we’re
not
limited
in
our
argument
to
the
fourteenth
amendment,
we
rely
also
on
the
thirteenth
amendment
which
i
think
is
very
helpful
in
this
kind
of
application
of
the
statute.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
of
course
that’s
what
i
was
hoping
to
get
to
but
i
imagine
i’ll
get
to
it
tomorrow.
the
allegations
and
the
complaint
that
i
think
are
relevant
here.
it
seems
to
me
that
that’s
an
instructive
place
to
begin
and
i’d
like
to
compare
those
allegations
with
other
provisions
of
federal
law
that
have
been
adopted
to
enforce
these
two
amendments
and
i’ll
begin
there
tomorrow.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
if
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
take
a
somewhat
indirect
approach
now
to
the
statutory
issue
that
i
began
to
discuss
yesterday.
and
while
this
may
seem
a
bit
roundabout,
i
believe
it
will
serve
to
help
to
clarify
our
position
in
this
case.
and
i'd
like
to
start
by
reminding
the
court
of
the
terms
of
the
statutory
provision
of
the
1866
act
that
was
before
it
two
terms
ago,
in
jones
against
mayer
&
company,
it's
now
section
1982
of
title
42
which
reads
"all
citizens
of
the
united
states
shall
have
the
same
right
in
every
state
and
territory
as
is
enjoyed
by
white
citizens
thereof
to
inherit,
purchase,
lease,
sell
hold
and
convey
real
and
personal
property"
and
a
similar
provision
of
the
1866
act
with
respect
entering
into
contracts
and
to
suing
and
beast
in
being
sued
is
now
in
section
1981.
there
is
in
the
complaint
to
the
present
case,
an
allegation
that's
rather
similar
in
its
terms,
at
least
in
what
we
deem
to
be
a
crucial
term
and
that
is
on
page
6
of
the
appendix
in
paragraph
12,
where
there's
an
allegation
that
by
this
conspiracy,
the
defendants
have
willfully
and
maliciously
intimidated
and
prevented
the
plaintiffs
from
enjoying
and
exercising,
going
down
to
the
bottom
of
this
paragraph,
their
rights
to
travel
the
public
highways
without
restrained
in
the
same
terms
as
white
citizens
in
kemper
county,
mississippi.
and
i
believe
this
similarity
has
some
relevance
because
of
the
threat
of
continuity
that
runs
through
the
adoption
of
all
three
of
these
amendments
to
the
constitution
and
through
the
whole
serious
of
legislations
through
the
1866,
1870,
and
1871
acts
and
even
the
1875
act
which
is
not
involved
here.
the
overriding
purpose
behind
all
of
these
provisions
and
it
colors
the
way
they
should
be
read
and
interpreted
as
this
court
has
said
many
times,
was
to
achieve
a
meaningful
emancipation
for
the
former
slaves
in
various
aspects
of
community
life.
this
was
certainly
a
purpose
to
be
achieved
in
1870
legislation
and
when
congress
was
made
aware
that
the
activities
of
the
ku
klux
klan
and
other
private
conspirators
were
interfering
with
the
achievements
of
this
objective,
congress
went
on
in
1871
to
enact
the
legislation
that’s
now
before
us
and
that
this
court
is
to
asked
to
interpret
in
this
case.
the
first
section
of
that
legislation
is
now
section
1983
of
title
42
and
that
is
quoted
on
page
10
of
our
brief,
our
grey
covered
brief
in
this
case.
that
provided
that
every
person
who
under
color
of
any
statute
or
ordinance,
regulation,
customer
usage
of
any
state
or
territory,
under
color
of
law,
subjects
or
causes
to
be
subjected,
any
citizens
of
the
united
states
or
other
person
within
the
jurisdiction
thereof
to
deprivation
of
any
rights,
privileges
or
immunities
secured
by
the
constitution
and
laws
is
liable
to
a
suit
for
damages.
now
that
covered
liability
by
public
officials
who
acting
under
color
of
law
have
deprived
complainants
of
rights
including
--
of
rights
under
fourth
--
under
the
constitution
including
fourteenth
amendment
rights.
this
court
has
several
times
held
that
the
statues
applies
to
fourteenth
amendment
rights,
as
well
to
other
rights
in
screws
against
united
states,
monroe
against
pape,
and
so
forth.
that
was
not,
as
this
court
noted
last
term
in
its
opinion
in
hedequist
against
crest
co,
that
was
not
the
most
controversial
provision
of
1871
legislation.
it
was
section
2
in
which
congress
went
on
to
reach
at
least
in
terms,
actions
that
are
not
taken
under
color
of
law
that
provoked
the
controversy.
and
before
proceeding
to
section
2,
i
want
to
say
one
other
thing
about
the
section
1983.
not
only
did
it
reach
actions
by
public
officials
and
make
them
subject
to
suit
for
damages,
it
also
extended,
it
has
been
held
a
number
of
times
to
actions
by
private
persons
taken
in
concert
with
public
officials.
those
two
are
actions
taken
under
color
of
law
as
this
court
held
with
respect
to
the
comparable
criminal
provision
in
the
united
states
against
price,
and
a
number
of
court
of
appeals
cases
have
held
the
same
thing
with
respect
to
1983
and
a
footnote
in
the
price
opinion
indicates
that
this
is
an
accurate
analysis.
so,
with
this
in
mind
as
what
was
accomplished
in
section
1
of
the
legislation,
i
think
we
can
turn
to
an
analysis
of
what
did
section
2
of
the
same
law
add.
now,
section
2
is
insofar
as
we're
concern
with
it,
the
civil
part
of
section
2
is
now
the
provision
before
us,
section
1985
(3)
of
title
42,
it's
set
forth
in
full
on
page
2
of
our
brief,
but
i
think
for
purposes
of
our
discussion,
it
will
be
more
convenient
to
refer
to
the
page
7
of
our
brief
in
which
we
have
quoted
from
the
collins
opinion.
this
court's
adumbration
of
the
various
provisions
with
numbering
added
to
it
that
are
covered
in
1985
(3)
and
here
is
where
the
congress
gave
attention
to
activities
of
private
conspirators
and
attempted
to
provide
redress
in
order
to,
as
i
said
the
outset,
achieve
the
meaningful
emancipation
that
was
the
overriding
objective.
one
of
the
things
that
the
congress
provided
redress
for
where
conspiracies
by
two
or
more
persons
in
the
part
number
2
here
on
page
7
to
prevent
or
hinder
the
constituted
authorities
from
giving
or
securing
to
all
persons,
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
interference
with
public
officials,
even
though
it
not
be
conspiratorial,
not
be
taken
on
concert,
that
is
conspiratorial
with
the
public
officials,
even
though
it
not
be
taken
in
concert
with
the
public
officials,
interference
with
there
providing
of
equal
protection
is
covered
by
that
part
of
1985
(3).
interference
in
concert
is
already
covered
in
section
1
of
the
act
as
i
said
and
then
the
part
numbered
3
and
4
provides
specific
protections
against
conspiracies,
to
interfere
with
voting
in
federal
elections
and
campaigning
in
federal
elections.
now,
the
question
remaining
and
the
key
question
in
this
case
is
what
does
the
first
part
add
to
these
provisions?
what
further
meaning
is
there
in
the
first
part
of
1985
(3)
are
approach
to
any
statue
as
that
each
part
must
mean
something
and
not
be
merely
redundant
of
what
is
enacted
right
along
with
it?
how
can
two
or
more
private
persons
conspire
without
in
someway
acting
under
the
color
of
law
or
in
concert
with
public
officials
so
as
to
deprive
any
person
or
class
persons
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws
or
of
equal
privileges
and
immunities
under
the
laws?
they
don't
have
the
authority
to
do
that.
that
is
the
conceptual
difficulty
with
trying
to
attribute
a
meaning
to
this
part
of
the
statute
that
goes
beyond
what
congress
had
already
done.
in
some
ways,
it's
very
similar
to
the
difficulty
that
three
justices
of
the
court
in
screws
against
the
united
states
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
monroe
against
pape
had
with
the
question
of
how
can
a
state
officials,
acting
contrary
to
state
law,
be
depriving
an
individual
of
rights
that
the
states
guarantees
him?
it's
a
rather
similar
conceptual
difficulty,
and
indeed,
the
answer
which
this
court
gave
in
the
collins
opinion
is
very
similar
to
the
answer
to
that
other
question
which
was
given
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
screws
against
united
states
and
in
the
dissenting
opinion
monroe
against
pape.
the
answer,
the
key
language
of
the
answer
can
be
found
on
page
8
of
our
brief,
the
very
next
page.
in
the
middle
of
the
page
in
the
paragraph
set
forth
on
the
middle
page,
the
second
sentence
of
that
paragraph
points
out
that
the
negative
answer
of
the
collins
opinion
said
that
unless
the
law
or
it's
agencies
were
to
give
sanction
or
sanctuary
to
private
conduct,
the
victims
rights,
this
is
quoting
from
collins,
the
victims
rights
under
the
laws
and
to
protection
of
the
laws
remain
untouched
and
equal
to
the
rights
of
every
other
person
within
the
state.
and
that
is
why
the
collins
opinion
in
effect
reads
this
part
of
1985
(3)
as
merely
redundant
of
1983,
is
really
accomplishing
the
same
thing.
but
if
we
look
back
at
the
language
of
the
statute
again,
the
statute
doesn't
say
that
the
wrong
as
to
deprive
someone
as
collins
said
of
the
rights
to
equal
protection
under
the
laws,
that's
not
what
the
statute
says.
the
statutes
says
“conspiracy
to
deprive
them
of
equal
protection
of
the
reality;
not
the
right.”
as
mr.
justice
brennan
pointed
out
in
his
opinion
in
hedequist
,
the
only
way
to
deprive
someone
of
the
right
to
equal
protection
of
the
laws
will
be
to
repeal
the
fourteenth
amendment.
that
couldn't
be
what
congress
had
in
my
mind.
no
private
persons
could
accomplish
that.
so
the
question
in
our
mind
becomes
what
it
that
private
persons
conspiring
together
can
do
that
would
deprive
someone
of
the
meaningful
enjoyment
of
these
guarantees
that
the
constitution
had
added
as
against
the
states,
besides
interfering
with
the
conduct
of
public
officials
which
covered
in
the
second
part
here.
what
is
it
besides
that
that
private
persons
can
do
that
would
interfere
with
the
enjoyment
of
these
rights?
well,
one
fairly
obvious
thing
to
refer
to
a
problem
that
is
again
before
this
court
is
term
would
be,
if
there
were
a
school
desegregation
order
and
private
persons
conspire
together
to
prevent
children
because
of
their
race
from
attending
a
particular
school,
intercepted
them
and
prevented
them
from
getting
there.
that
would
not
be
action
taken
under
color
of
law,
it
would
not
be
action
taken
in
concert
with
public
officials,
and
it
seems
to
us
that
it
would
be
a
deprivation
of
enjoyment
of
the
right
to
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
undoubtedly
are,
but
congress
was
concerned
in
enacting
this
very
statute
that
other
ways
that
might
be
available,
other
legal
remedies
such
as
remedies
in
the
states
might
not
prove
effective
to
protect
the
rights
that
they
were
trying
to
confer.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
would
be
remedies
connected
with
the
court
order
if
the
desegregation
were
being
accomplished
under
a
court
order.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
would
be
the
possibility
of
a
federal
statue.
i
am
not
sure
however
that
if
all
that
were
involved
were
a
plan
voluntary
adopted
by
the
school
board
to
comply
with
the
law
of
the
land,
school
board
not
under
court
order,
that
any
federal
statute
about
obstructing
justice
would
be
applicable.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
in
response
to
your
question,
but
it
seems
to
me,
it
would
still
be
within
the
coverage
of
this
provision.
the
concern
of
congress
was
with
the
possibility
that
the
rights
would
not
be
enjoyed
because
private
persons
would
prevent
their
enjoyment.
as
matter
of
fact,
there
is
very
specific
referenced
to
this
in
a
legislative
history
of
the
amendment
adding
the
word
equal
which
mr.
pollak
spoke
about
yesterday.
i'd
like
to
refer
the
court
to
that
history.
these
are
the
remarks
by
representative
garfield,
later,
the
president
of
the
united
states
in
support
of
this
amendment
and
in
support
of
the
provision
that
then
was
enacted
as
a
consequence
of
this
amendment.
and
this
appears
--
this
is
not
quoted
in
a
briefs
unfortunately,
it
appears
on
page
153
of
the
congressional
globe
for
the
42nd
congress,
first
session.
these
remarks
incidentally
were
cited,
although
this
particular
one’s
were
not
quoted
in
mr.
justice
brennan's
opinion
in
hedequist.
mr.
garfield,
representative
garfield
said
there
in
support
of
the
amendment
and
i
quote
now,
"to
state
the
case
is
the
most
moderate
terms,
it
appears
that
some
of
the
southern
states,
there
exists
a
wide
spread
secret
organization
whose
members
are
bound
together
by
solemn
oath
to
prevent
certain
classes
of
citizens,
certain
classes
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
from
enjoying
their
new
rights.
these
new
rights
conferred
upon
them
by
the
constitution
and
laws
and
they
are
putting
into
execution
their
design
of
preventing
such
citizens
from
enjoying
the
free
right
of
the
ballot
box
and
other
privileges
and
immunities
of
citizens
and
from
enjoying
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws."
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
argue
in
our
brief
that
as
applied
here,
the
thirteenth
amendment
is
applicable
to
this
application,
and
that
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
enforcement
provision
of
both
of
those
amendments,
it
would
be
the
relevant
provisions.
if
i
may
mr.
justice,
i'd
like
get
to
that
in
just
moment
after
i
finish
this
statutory
analysis
and
it's
applicability
to
this
case
as
we
see
it.
given
that
much
meaning
of
the
statue,
we
say
that
even
that
applies
here
because
the
allegation
is
of
a
terroristic,
coercive
interference
with
the
use
of
public
highways,
that
is
exactly
what
happened
here.
in
fact,
it's
not
terribly
different
from
some
of
the
activities
of
the
klan
during
the
period
in
which
congress
was
enacting
this
legislation.
we
think
really
that
the
right
should
probably
be
formulated
in
more
basic
terms
than
that.
we
don't
think
it
would
really
make
a
difference
in
this
case
if
the
interception
had
occurred
on
a
private
driveway
rather
than
on
the
public
road.
as
this
court
noted
jones
against
mayer
co.,
one
of
the
rights
that
congress
was
concerned
to
accomplished
through
the
adoption
of
the
thirteenth
amendment
in
1866
legislation
and
we
say
there
is
threat
of
continuity
running
through
here
was
to
see
to
it
that
the
newly
emancipated
negroes
would
have,
in
senator
trumble's
words
that
were
–
and
they
are
quoted,
"freedom
to
go
and
come
at
pleasure."
and
certainly,
the
kind
of
freedom
to
go
and
come
for
this
class
of
persons
that
would
be
upheld
for
white
persons,
for
the
ordinary
persons
in
the
community
is
of
the
essence
of
a
accomplishing
a
meaningful
emancipation,
changing
people's
status
from
a
subjugated
status
to
a
free
status.
and
this
why
it
seems
to
us
that
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
was
to
protect
persons
from
private
conspiracies
directed
against
them
because
of
their
membership
in
a
class,
because
of
their
race
or
other
comparable
membership
in
a
class
directed
toward
keeping
them
in
an
inferior
status,
preventing
them
from
enjoying
these
rights
in
the
public
sectors,
as
we
say
in
our
brief,
that
others
in
the
community
have
the
right
under
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendments
against
the
state
to
enjoy.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
court’s
opinion
in
jones,
practically
points
the
way
to
the
application
of
the
thirteenth
amendment
to
sustain
the
statute
to
get
back
to
mr.
justice
harlan’s
question.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
as
a
source
of
congressional
power.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
now,
that's
why
i
thought
our
problem
--
real
problem
here
was
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
was
with
the
statute
and
i
think
this
is
what
statute
must
have
meant,
and
then,
this
kind
of
application
seems
to
us
is
sustained
there
by
the
constitutional
analysis
in
jones.
and
we
see
no
problems
with
upholding
this
application
without
reaching
the
question
of
other
possible
applications.
after
all,
this
is
not
criminal
statute
where
we
need
worry
as
much
about
notice
from
a
restricted
reading
of
it
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
principles
of
the
united
states
against
raines
applies
sort
of
a
fortiori
with
civil
statute
of
this
kind.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
with
purposes
alleged
here,
with
purposes
alleged,
it's
not
an
allegation
of
a
mere
assault.
it's
allegation
of
the
assault
was
to
prevent
these
persons
because
of
their
race
from
enjoying
the
same
right
to
use
public
highways,
to
go
and
come
as
they
please
as
white
citizens
of
this
county.
that
was
the
reason
for
the
assault,
that
coercion
has
being
applied
to
them,
to
keep
them
in
[voice
overlap]
subjugated
status.
that,
it
seems
to
us
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
do
say
in
our
brief
that
this
purpose
to
keep
in
an
inferior
status
probably
can
be
inferred
in
most
such
instances
where
that's
the
intent,
but
here
where
there
is
no
more
intent
than
that
shown,
but
here
there
is
more
intent
than
that
shown.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
alleged,
yes.
well
that's
the
allegation
after
the
acceptance.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
more
is
they
were
not
to
have
the
rights
that
white
person
have
to
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
to
go
and
come.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
there's
no
--
if
there's
no
personal
reason
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
there's
no
personal
reason
for
what
is
done,
if
it's
done
only
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
because
they
are
fair
game,
because
they
are
inferior
human
beings,
well,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
what
congress
was
trying
to
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
do.
it's
difficult
for
us
to
see
what
else
this
language
means
in
the
context
as
i
built
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
would
be
a
possibility,
but
there
is
a
use
of
the
state
facilities
here.
they
have
the
right
the
equal
use
of
the
states
highways;
it's
not
on
these
facts
a
really
different
case
in
our
view.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
so
ended
in
the
school.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
the
right
to
attend
the
public
schools.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
right.
to
us,
it's
--
it
really
is
the
same
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
--
but
i
would
hypothesize
the
case
where
there
is
no
court
order.
the
school
board
has
voluntary
adopted
a
desegregation
plan,
and
conspirators
keep
the
negro
children
from
attending
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
don't
see
the
distinction.
the
rights
are
against
the
state
in
both
cases.
in
both
cases,
the
use
of
the
state
facilities
are
being
interfered
with
by
conspiracy
and
it
is
because
of
the
class
discrimination.
it
is
because
of
a
desire
to
keep
a
former
slave
race
in
a
subjugated
state.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
hypothetical
mr.
chief
justice
is
to
me
indistinguishable
from
the
facts
of
collins
against
hardyman,
which
also
involved
a
first
amendment
right
assembly
in
order
to
oppose
the
marshal
plan,
a
political
group
and
there,
i
think
the
statutory
language
as
we
read
it
would
be
applicable,
but
we
would
no
longer
be
able
to
draw
upon
the
thirteenth
amendment
as
the
source
of
the
congressional
authority
and
we
have
to
rely
exclusively
on
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
i
think
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
provide
assistance
in
this
case
and
is
a
basis
for
authority.
six
justices
in
the
guest
case
said
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
will
support
federal
legislation,
punishing
all
conspiracies
with
or
without
state
action
that
interfere
with
fourteenth
amendment
rights,
that
interfere
with
fourteenth
amendment
right.
and
i
don’t
think
that
that
principle
means
that
congress
thereby
is
empowered
to
reach
every
possible
tort
or
crime
under
state
law.
the
formulation
itself
indicates
a
limitation
on
its
applicability.
it's
inference
with
the
rights
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
protects
against
the
states.
we're
not
dealing
here
in
an
area
where
a
state
has,
pursuant
to
some
neutral
principle,
relegated
decision
making
to
private
persons
which
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
court
was
concerned
with
in
the
civil
rights
cases.
this
is
not
that
kind
of
area.
it's
not
freedom
to
come
and
go
in
somebody
else's
place.
it's
freedom
to
come
and
go
on
the
public
thorough
fares,
and
we
are
dealing
with
class
discriminations
with
the
new
right
that
was
established
in
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
right
to
equality
that
the
sponsors
of
the
amendment
and
the
sponsors
of
the
legislation
thought
because
of
its
newness
would
need
special
federal
nurture
and
federal
protection.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
right,
that's
alleged.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
with
conspiracy
can
be
proved
by
proof
of
certain
conduct
and
the
inferences
that
should
be
drawn
from
the
conduct
and
i
don't
think
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
this
wasn't
a
mere
attack
mr.
chief
justice.
this
was
interception
of
the
car.
they
cut
off
this
car
on
the
public
highway
and
proceeded
at
gun
point
to
remove
these
people
from
the
car
and
attack
them.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
maybe
more
reason
to
read
conspiracy
laws
more
narrowly
when
criminal
sanctions
are
involved.
here,
we
have
a
effort
by
congress
to
provide
civil
redress
for
interference
with
the
enjoyment
of
rights
that
congress
was
trying
to
confer
upon
these
people
and
it's
apparently
that
damage
was
done
through
concerted
action
which
at
least
the
trier
of
fact
could
infer
involved
some
conspiratorial
design
between
the
actors.
i
don't
see
why
a
civil
statute
should
be
read
more
strictly
than
that.
the
object
was
to
provide
redress
for
damages
and
damages
were
done
here.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
perhaps
so
mr.
chief
justice,
that
isn't
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
proper
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
wish
first
to
speak
to
the
question
that
was
put
by
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
justice
blackmun.
as
we
see
the
issue
of
what
right
it
is
that
is
being
denied
by
the
private
conduct
here,
i
think
some
insight
into
the
answer
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
why
is
there
a
violation
of
--
why
is
there
a
deprivation
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
that
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
we
agree
with
mr.
pollak
that
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
as
used
in
both
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
there’s
no
reason
to
read
it
differently
in
this
statute,
embraces
enjoyment
of
the
rights
that
are
guaranteed
as
against
the
state
and
the
question
is
how
is
this
conspiracy
interfered
with
that
one
of
those
rights
that
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that’s
correct.
the
rights
that
are
guaranteed
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
against
the
state,
that
as
i
understood
it
was
the
question.
that
was
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct
and
which
includes
the
right
to
enjoyment
of
that
guarantee
as
against
the
states.
this
was
held
as
far
back
as
ex
parte
virginia
in
strauder
against
west
virginia.
it’s
not
merely
the
abstract
right
as
against
the
state
but
it’s
a
right
to
enjoyment.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
could
be
read
that
way.
we’ve
expressed
some
difficulty
on
the
facts
of
this
case
about
tying
in
the
allegations
of
this
complaint
with
what
has
traditionally
been
denominated
one
of
the
rights
of
national
citizenship.
but
i
think
it’s
instructive
to
see
our
position
to
look
at
the
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it’s
a
statutory
case,
and
the
terms
of
the
statute
that
are
the
issue
here
are
identical
to
the
terms
used
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it’s
been
interpreted
to
a
fact
that
guarantee,
yes
but
the
words
aren’t
there
mr.
justice
and
the
words
that
were
used
here
are
words
that
were
used
contemporaneously
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
though
that
was
the
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
as
i
say,
it’s
a
statutory
case
but
obviously
the
words
of
the
statute
have
a
background
in
the
purpose
of
the
congress
that
adopted
the
thirteenth,
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments
and
contemporaneously
used
the
same
words
and
this
after
all
was
denominated
by
that
congress
enact
for
enforcement
of
--
for
the
purpose
of
enforcing
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
for
other
purposes.
we
say
we’re
not
limited
in
our
argument
to
the
fourteenth
amendment,
we
rely
also
on
the
thirteenth
amendment
which
i
think
is
very
helpful
in
this
kind
of
application
of
the
statute.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
of
course
that’s
what
i
was
hoping
to
get
to
but
i
imagine
i’ll
get
to
it
tomorrow.
the
allegations
and
the
complaint
that
i
think
are
relevant
here.
it
seems
to
me
that
that’s
an
instructive
place
to
begin
and
i’d
like
to
compare
those
allegations
with
other
provisions
of
federal
law
that
have
been
adopted
to
enforce
these
two
amendments
and
i’ll
begin
there
tomorrow.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
if
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
take
a
somewhat
indirect
approach
now
to
the
statutory
issue
that
i
began
to
discuss
yesterday.
and
while
this
may
seem
a
bit
roundabout,
i
believe
it
will
serve
to
help
to
clarify
our
position
in
this
case.
and
i'd
like
to
start
by
reminding
the
court
of
the
terms
of
the
statutory
provision
of
the
1866
act
that
was
before
it
two
terms
ago,
in
jones
against
mayer
&
company,
it's
now
section
1982
of
title
42
which
reads
"all
citizens
of
the
united
states
shall
have
the
same
right
in
every
state
and
territory
as
is
enjoyed
by
white
citizens
thereof
to
inherit,
purchase,
lease,
sell
hold
and
convey
real
and
personal
property"
and
a
similar
provision
of
the
1866
act
with
respect
entering
into
contracts
and
to
suing
and
beast
in
being
sued
is
now
in
section
1981.
there
is
in
the
complaint
to
the
present
case,
an
allegation
that's
rather
similar
in
its
terms,
at
least
in
what
we
deem
to
be
a
crucial
term
and
that
is
on
page
6
of
the
appendix
in
paragraph
12,
where
there's
an
allegation
that
by
this
conspiracy,
the
defendants
have
willfully
and
maliciously
intimidated
and
prevented
the
plaintiffs
from
enjoying
and
exercising,
going
down
to
the
bottom
of
this
paragraph,
their
rights
to
travel
the
public
highways
without
restrained
in
the
same
terms
as
white
citizens
in
kemper
county,
mississippi.
and
i
believe
this
similarity
has
some
relevance
because
of
the
threat
of
continuity
that
runs
through
the
adoption
of
all
three
of
these
amendments
to
the
constitution
and
through
the
whole
serious
of
legislations
through
the
1866,
1870,
and
1871
acts
and
even
the
1875
act
which
is
not
involved
here.
the
overriding
purpose
behind
all
of
these
provisions
and
it
colors
the
way
they
should
be
read
and
interpreted
as
this
court
has
said
many
times,
was
to
achieve
a
meaningful
emancipation
for
the
former
slaves
in
various
aspects
of
community
life.
this
was
certainly
a
purpose
to
be
achieved
in
1870
legislation
and
when
congress
was
made
aware
that
the
activities
of
the
ku
klux
klan
and
other
private
conspirators
were
interfering
with
the
achievements
of
this
objective,
congress
went
on
in
1871
to
enact
the
legislation
that’s
now
before
us
and
that
this
court
is
to
asked
to
interpret
in
this
case.
the
first
section
of
that
legislation
is
now
section
1983
of
title
42
and
that
is
quoted
on
page
10
of
our
brief,
our
grey
covered
brief
in
this
case.
that
provided
that
every
person
who
under
color
of
any
statute
or
ordinance,
regulation,
customer
usage
of
any
state
or
territory,
under
color
of
law,
subjects
or
causes
to
be
subjected,
any
citizens
of
the
united
states
or
other
person
within
the
jurisdiction
thereof
to
deprivation
of
any
rights,
privileges
or
immunities
secured
by
the
constitution
and
laws
is
liable
to
a
suit
for
damages.
now
that
covered
liability
by
public
officials
who
acting
under
color
of
law
have
deprived
complainants
of
rights
including
--
of
rights
under
fourth
--
under
the
constitution
including
fourteenth
amendment
rights.
this
court
has
several
times
held
that
the
statues
applies
to
fourteenth
amendment
rights,
as
well
to
other
rights
in
screws
against
united
states,
monroe
against
pape,
and
so
forth.
that
was
not,
as
this
court
noted
last
term
in
its
opinion
in
hedequist
against
crest
co,
that
was
not
the
most
controversial
provision
of
1871
legislation.
it
was
section
2
in
which
congress
went
on
to
reach
at
least
in
terms,
actions
that
are
not
taken
under
color
of
law
that
provoked
the
controversy.
and
before
proceeding
to
section
2,
i
want
to
say
one
other
thing
about
the
section
1983.
not
only
did
it
reach
actions
by
public
officials
and
make
them
subject
to
suit
for
damages,
it
also
extended,
it
has
been
held
a
number
of
times
to
actions
by
private
persons
taken
in
concert
with
public
officials.
those
two
are
actions
taken
under
color
of
law
as
this
court
held
with
respect
to
the
comparable
criminal
provision
in
the
united
states
against
price,
and
a
number
of
court
of
appeals
cases
have
held
the
same
thing
with
respect
to
1983
and
a
footnote
in
the
price
opinion
indicates
that
this
is
an
accurate
analysis.
so,
with
this
in
mind
as
what
was
accomplished
in
section
1
of
the
legislation,
i
think
we
can
turn
to
an
analysis
of
what
did
section
2
of
the
same
law
add.
now,
section
2
is
insofar
as
we're
concern
with
it,
the
civil
part
of
section
2
is
now
the
provision
before
us,
section
1985
(3)
of
title
42,
it's
set
forth
in
full
on
page
2
of
our
brief,
but
i
think
for
purposes
of
our
discussion,
it
will
be
more
convenient
to
refer
to
the
page
7
of
our
brief
in
which
we
have
quoted
from
the
collins
opinion.
this
court's
adumbration
of
the
various
provisions
with
numbering
added
to
it
that
are
covered
in
1985
(3)
and
here
is
where
the
congress
gave
attention
to
activities
of
private
conspirators
and
attempted
to
provide
redress
in
order
to,
as
i
said
the
outset,
achieve
the
meaningful
emancipation
that
was
the
overriding
objective.
one
of
the
things
that
the
congress
provided
redress
for
where
conspiracies
by
two
or
more
persons
in
the
part
number
2
here
on
page
7
to
prevent
or
hinder
the
constituted
authorities
from
giving
or
securing
to
all
persons,
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
interference
with
public
officials,
even
though
it
not
be
conspiratorial,
not
be
taken
on
concert,
that
is
conspiratorial
with
the
public
officials,
even
though
it
not
be
taken
in
concert
with
the
public
officials,
interference
with
there
providing
of
equal
protection
is
covered
by
that
part
of
1985
(3).
interference
in
concert
is
already
covered
in
section
1
of
the
act
as
i
said
and
then
the
part
numbered
3
and
4
provides
specific
protections
against
conspiracies,
to
interfere
with
voting
in
federal
elections
and
campaigning
in
federal
elections.
now,
the
question
remaining
and
the
key
question
in
this
case
is
what
does
the
first
part
add
to
these
provisions?
what
further
meaning
is
there
in
the
first
part
of
1985
(3)
are
approach
to
any
statue
as
that
each
part
must
mean
something
and
not
be
merely
redundant
of
what
is
enacted
right
along
with
it?
how
can
two
or
more
private
persons
conspire
without
in
someway
acting
under
the
color
of
law
or
in
concert
with
public
officials
so
as
to
deprive
any
person
or
class
persons
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws
or
of
equal
privileges
and
immunities
under
the
laws?
they
don't
have
the
authority
to
do
that.
that
is
the
conceptual
difficulty
with
trying
to
attribute
a
meaning
to
this
part
of
the
statute
that
goes
beyond
what
congress
had
already
done.
in
some
ways,
it's
very
similar
to
the
difficulty
that
three
justices
of
the
court
in
screws
against
the
united
states
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
monroe
against
pape
had
with
the
question
of
how
can
a
state
officials,
acting
contrary
to
state
law,
be
depriving
an
individual
of
rights
that
the
states
guarantees
him?
it's
a
rather
similar
conceptual
difficulty,
and
indeed,
the
answer
which
this
court
gave
in
the
collins
opinion
is
very
similar
to
the
answer
to
that
other
question
which
was
given
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
screws
against
united
states
and
in
the
dissenting
opinion
monroe
against
pape.
the
answer,
the
key
language
of
the
answer
can
be
found
on
page
8
of
our
brief,
the
very
next
page.
in
the
middle
of
the
page
in
the
paragraph
set
forth
on
the
middle
page,
the
second
sentence
of
that
paragraph
points
out
that
the
negative
answer
of
the
collins
opinion
said
that
unless
the
law
or
it's
agencies
were
to
give
sanction
or
sanctuary
to
private
conduct,
the
victims
rights,
this
is
quoting
from
collins,
the
victims
rights
under
the
laws
and
to
protection
of
the
laws
remain
untouched
and
equal
to
the
rights
of
every
other
person
within
the
state.
and
that
is
why
the
collins
opinion
in
effect
reads
this
part
of
1985
(3)
as
merely
redundant
of
1983,
is
really
accomplishing
the
same
thing.
but
if
we
look
back
at
the
language
of
the
statute
again,
the
statute
doesn't
say
that
the
wrong
as
to
deprive
someone
as
collins
said
of
the
rights
to
equal
protection
under
the
laws,
that's
not
what
the
statute
says.
the
statutes
says
“conspiracy
to
deprive
them
of
equal
protection
of
the
reality;
not
the
right.”
as
mr.
justice
brennan
pointed
out
in
his
opinion
in
hedequist
,
the
only
way
to
deprive
someone
of
the
right
to
equal
protection
of
the
laws
will
be
to
repeal
the
fourteenth
amendment.
that
couldn't
be
what
congress
had
in
my
mind.
no
private
persons
could
accomplish
that.
so
the
question
in
our
mind
becomes
what
it
that
private
persons
conspiring
together
can
do
that
would
deprive
someone
of
the
meaningful
enjoyment
of
these
guarantees
that
the
constitution
had
added
as
against
the
states,
besides
interfering
with
the
conduct
of
public
officials
which
covered
in
the
second
part
here.
what
is
it
besides
that
that
private
persons
can
do
that
would
interfere
with
the
enjoyment
of
these
rights?
well,
one
fairly
obvious
thing
to
refer
to
a
problem
that
is
again
before
this
court
is
term
would
be,
if
there
were
a
school
desegregation
order
and
private
persons
conspire
together
to
prevent
children
because
of
their
race
from
attending
a
particular
school,
intercepted
them
and
prevented
them
from
getting
there.
that
would
not
be
action
taken
under
color
of
law,
it
would
not
be
action
taken
in
concert
with
public
officials,
and
it
seems
to
us
that
it
would
be
a
deprivation
of
enjoyment
of
the
right
to
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
undoubtedly
are,
but
congress
was
concerned
in
enacting
this
very
statute
that
other
ways
that
might
be
available,
other
legal
remedies
such
as
remedies
in
the
states
might
not
prove
effective
to
protect
the
rights
that
they
were
trying
to
confer.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
would
be
remedies
connected
with
the
court
order
if
the
desegregation
were
being
accomplished
under
a
court
order.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
would
be
the
possibility
of
a
federal
statue.
i
am
not
sure
however
that
if
all
that
were
involved
were
a
plan
voluntary
adopted
by
the
school
board
to
comply
with
the
law
of
the
land,
school
board
not
under
court
order,
that
any
federal
statute
about
obstructing
justice
would
be
applicable.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
in
response
to
your
question,
but
it
seems
to
me,
it
would
still
be
within
the
coverage
of
this
provision.
the
concern
of
congress
was
with
the
possibility
that
the
rights
would
not
be
enjoyed
because
private
persons
would
prevent
their
enjoyment.
as
matter
of
fact,
there
is
very
specific
referenced
to
this
in
a
legislative
history
of
the
amendment
adding
the
word
equal
which
mr.
pollak
spoke
about
yesterday.
i'd
like
to
refer
the
court
to
that
history.
these
are
the
remarks
by
representative
garfield,
later,
the
president
of
the
united
states
in
support
of
this
amendment
and
in
support
of
the
provision
that
then
was
enacted
as
a
consequence
of
this
amendment.
and
this
appears
--
this
is
not
quoted
in
a
briefs
unfortunately,
it
appears
on
page
153
of
the
congressional
globe
for
the
42nd
congress,
first
session.
these
remarks
incidentally
were
cited,
although
this
particular
one’s
were
not
quoted
in
mr.
justice
brennan's
opinion
in
hedequist.
mr.
garfield,
representative
garfield
said
there
in
support
of
the
amendment
and
i
quote
now,
"to
state
the
case
is
the
most
moderate
terms,
it
appears
that
some
of
the
southern
states,
there
exists
a
wide
spread
secret
organization
whose
members
are
bound
together
by
solemn
oath
to
prevent
certain
classes
of
citizens,
certain
classes
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
from
enjoying
their
new
rights.
these
new
rights
conferred
upon
them
by
the
constitution
and
laws
and
they
are
putting
into
execution
their
design
of
preventing
such
citizens
from
enjoying
the
free
right
of
the
ballot
box
and
other
privileges
and
immunities
of
citizens
and
from
enjoying
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws."
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
argue
in
our
brief
that
as
applied
here,
the
thirteenth
amendment
is
applicable
to
this
application,
and
that
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
enforcement
provision
of
both
of
those
amendments,
it
would
be
the
relevant
provisions.
if
i
may
mr.
justice,
i'd
like
get
to
that
in
just
moment
after
i
finish
this
statutory
analysis
and
it's
applicability
to
this
case
as
we
see
it.
given
that
much
meaning
of
the
statue,
we
say
that
even
that
applies
here
because
the
allegation
is
of
a
terroristic,
coercive
interference
with
the
use
of
public
highways,
that
is
exactly
what
happened
here.
in
fact,
it's
not
terribly
different
from
some
of
the
activities
of
the
klan
during
the
period
in
which
congress
was
enacting
this
legislation.
we
think
really
that
the
right
should
probably
be
formulated
in
more
basic
terms
than
that.
we
don't
think
it
would
really
make
a
difference
in
this
case
if
the
interception
had
occurred
on
a
private
driveway
rather
than
on
the
public
road.
as
this
court
noted
jones
against
mayer
co.,
one
of
the
rights
that
congress
was
concerned
to
accomplished
through
the
adoption
of
the
thirteenth
amendment
in
1866
legislation
and
we
say
there
is
threat
of
continuity
running
through
here
was
to
see
to
it
that
the
newly
emancipated
negroes
would
have,
in
senator
trumble's
words
that
were
–
and
they
are
quoted,
"freedom
to
go
and
come
at
pleasure."
and
certainly,
the
kind
of
freedom
to
go
and
come
for
this
class
of
persons
that
would
be
upheld
for
white
persons,
for
the
ordinary
persons
in
the
community
is
of
the
essence
of
a
accomplishing
a
meaningful
emancipation,
changing
people's
status
from
a
subjugated
status
to
a
free
status.
and
this
why
it
seems
to
us
that
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
was
to
protect
persons
from
private
conspiracies
directed
against
them
because
of
their
membership
in
a
class,
because
of
their
race
or
other
comparable
membership
in
a
class
directed
toward
keeping
them
in
an
inferior
status,
preventing
them
from
enjoying
these
rights
in
the
public
sectors,
as
we
say
in
our
brief,
that
others
in
the
community
have
the
right
under
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendments
against
the
state
to
enjoy.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
court’s
opinion
in
jones,
practically
points
the
way
to
the
application
of
the
thirteenth
amendment
to
sustain
the
statute
to
get
back
to
mr.
justice
harlan’s
question.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
as
a
source
of
congressional
power.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
now,
that's
why
i
thought
our
problem
--
real
problem
here
was
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
was
with
the
statute
and
i
think
this
is
what
statute
must
have
meant,
and
then,
this
kind
of
application
seems
to
us
is
sustained
there
by
the
constitutional
analysis
in
jones.
and
we
see
no
problems
with
upholding
this
application
without
reaching
the
question
of
other
possible
applications.
after
all,
this
is
not
criminal
statute
where
we
need
worry
as
much
about
notice
from
a
restricted
reading
of
it
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
principles
of
the
united
states
against
raines
applies
sort
of
a
fortiori
with
civil
statute
of
this
kind.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
with
purposes
alleged
here,
with
purposes
alleged,
it's
not
an
allegation
of
a
mere
assault.
it's
allegation
of
the
assault
was
to
prevent
these
persons
because
of
their
race
from
enjoying
the
same
right
to
use
public
highways,
to
go
and
come
as
they
please
as
white
citizens
of
this
county.
that
was
the
reason
for
the
assault,
that
coercion
has
being
applied
to
them,
to
keep
them
in
[voice
overlap]
subjugated
status.
that,
it
seems
to
us
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
do
say
in
our
brief
that
this
purpose
to
keep
in
an
inferior
status
probably
can
be
inferred
in
most
such
instances
where
that's
the
intent,
but
here
where
there
is
no
more
intent
than
that
shown,
but
here
there
is
more
intent
than
that
shown.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
alleged,
yes.
well
that's
the
allegation
after
the
acceptance.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
more
is
they
were
not
to
have
the
rights
that
white
person
have
to
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
to
go
and
come.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
there's
no
--
if
there's
no
personal
reason
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
there's
no
personal
reason
for
what
is
done,
if
it's
done
only
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
because
they
are
fair
game,
because
they
are
inferior
human
beings,
well,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
what
congress
was
trying
to
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
do.
it's
difficult
for
us
to
see
what
else
this
language
means
in
the
context
as
i
built
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
would
be
a
possibility,
but
there
is
a
use
of
the
state
facilities
here.
they
have
the
right
the
equal
use
of
the
states
highways;
it's
not
on
these
facts
a
really
different
case
in
our
view.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
so
ended
in
the
school.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
the
right
to
attend
the
public
schools.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
right.
to
us,
it's
--
it
really
is
the
same
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
--
but
i
would
hypothesize
the
case
where
there
is
no
court
order.
the
school
board
has
voluntary
adopted
a
desegregation
plan,
and
conspirators
keep
the
negro
children
from
attending
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
don't
see
the
distinction.
the
rights
are
against
the
state
in
both
cases.
in
both
cases,
the
use
of
the
state
facilities
are
being
interfered
with
by
conspiracy
and
it
is
because
of
the
class
discrimination.
it
is
because
of
a
desire
to
keep
a
former
slave
race
in
a
subjugated
state.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
hypothetical
mr.
chief
justice
is
to
me
indistinguishable
from
the
facts
of
collins
against
hardyman,
which
also
involved
a
first
amendment
right
assembly
in
order
to
oppose
the
marshal
plan,
a
political
group
and
there,
i
think
the
statutory
language
as
we
read
it
would
be
applicable,
but
we
would
no
longer
be
able
to
draw
upon
the
thirteenth
amendment
as
the
source
of
the
congressional
authority
and
we
have
to
rely
exclusively
on
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
i
think
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
provide
assistance
in
this
case
and
is
a
basis
for
authority.
six
justices
in
the
guest
case
said
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
will
support
federal
legislation,
punishing
all
conspiracies
with
or
without
state
action
that
interfere
with
fourteenth
amendment
rights,
that
interfere
with
fourteenth
amendment
right.
and
i
don’t
think
that
that
principle
means
that
congress
thereby
is
empowered
to
reach
every
possible
tort
or
crime
under
state
law.
the
formulation
itself
indicates
a
limitation
on
its
applicability.
it's
inference
with
the
rights
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
protects
against
the
states.
we're
not
dealing
here
in
an
area
where
a
state
has,
pursuant
to
some
neutral
principle,
relegated
decision
making
to
private
persons
which
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
court
was
concerned
with
in
the
civil
rights
cases.
this
is
not
that
kind
of
area.
it's
not
freedom
to
come
and
go
in
somebody
else's
place.
it's
freedom
to
come
and
go
on
the
public
thorough
fares,
and
we
are
dealing
with
class
discriminations
with
the
new
right
that
was
established
in
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
right
to
equality
that
the
sponsors
of
the
amendment
and
the
sponsors
of
the
legislation
thought
because
of
its
newness
would
need
special
federal
nurture
and
federal
protection.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
right,
that's
alleged.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
with
conspiracy
can
be
proved
by
proof
of
certain
conduct
and
the
inferences
that
should
be
drawn
from
the
conduct
and
i
don't
think
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
this
wasn't
a
mere
attack
mr.
chief
justice.
this
was
interception
of
the
car.
they
cut
off
this
car
on
the
public
highway
and
proceeded
at
gun
point
to
remove
these
people
from
the
car
and
attack
them.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
maybe
more
reason
to
read
conspiracy
laws
more
narrowly
when
criminal
sanctions
are
involved.
here,
we
have
a
effort
by
congress
to
provide
civil
redress
for
interference
with
the
enjoyment
of
rights
that
congress
was
trying
to
confer
upon
these
people
and
it's
apparently
that
damage
was
done
through
concerted
action
which
at
least
the
trier
of
fact
could
infer
involved
some
conspiratorial
design
between
the
actors.
i
don't
see
why
a
civil
statute
should
be
read
more
strictly
than
that.
the
object
was
to
provide
redress
for
damages
and
damages
were
done
here.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
perhaps
so
mr.
chief
justice,
that
isn't
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
proper
your
honor.
thank
you.
