mr.
george
spiegel
well,
procedurally
they’re
completely
separated?
mr.
george
spiegel
but
in
terms
of
the
subject
matter
they
are
the
same.
mr.
george
spiegel
yes.
mr.
george
spiegel
and
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
city
of
gainesville,
florida
operates
an
isolated
electric
system
serving
some
60,000
people
and
alachua
county,
florida
and
is
a
rapidly
growing
system
with
a
demand
doubling
every
five
years
in
a
concomitant
necessity
to
continue
to
build
additional
generating
facilities.
there
is
in
florida
and
there
was
at
the
time
in
1965
an
interconnected
system
of
five
utilities.
our
home
were
interconnected
with
each
other,
were
selling
power
back
and
forth
between
each
other
and
generally
applying
to
each
other
mutual
assistance
and
their
operations
in
general
were
guided
by
an
operating
committee
and
their
interconnections
were
founded
upon
bilateral
agreements.
the
city
of
gainesville
desires
to
interconnect
with
this
grid
or
this
pool
and
it
was
unable
to
negotiate
an
agreement
with
either
of
its
closest
neighbors,
florida
power
and
light
company
and
florida
power
corporation
and
accordingly
--
mr.
george
spiegel
no,
your
honor.
mr.
george
spiegel
yes,
during
world
war
ii,
there
was
an
emergency
interconnection
with
florida
power
corporation
which
was
severed
shortly
after
the
war.
we
commission
after
extents
of
hearings
under
section
202
(b)
of
the
federal
power
act
ordered
the
interconnection
and
fixed
the
terms
and
conditions
for
the
sale
of
energy
across
that
interconnection
and
for
the
responsibilities
which
gainesville
would
have
to
assume
by
way
of
providing
generating
capacity
reserves
to
the
interconnected
system.
and
in
general,
the
commission
fixed
the
same
pro
rata
terms
and
obligations
on
gainesville
as
what
exists
among
members
of
the
pool.
appeal
was
taken
--
a
petition
for
review
was
taken
to
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
by
florida
power
corporation.
mr.
george
spiegel
yes,
sir.
there
are
some
minor
differences
in
certain
of
individual
bilateral
contracts
but
in
general
they
are
the
same.
but
the
commission
does
require
that
gainesville
abide
by
the
operating
criteria
of
the
florida
operating
committee
precisely
the
same
as
other
systems.
three
issues
were
presented
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
first
issue
being
whether
the
commission
had
authority
to
order
the
interconnection
and
the
court
upheld
the
commission
on
that.
the
second
issue
was
whether
the
commission
should
be
required
to
condition
the
interconnection
upon
the
making
of
a
territorial
agreement
between
the
parties.
the
commission
had
declined
to
do
so
and
the
court
had
upheld
the
commission
on
that
issue.
the
only
question
on
which
--
the
third
question
and
the
only
question
on
which
the
court
reversed
was
as
to
a
single
aspect
of
the
compensation
arrangement.
there’s
no
disagreement
as
to
what
the
price
should
be
when
economy
energy
flows
through
the
system
between
a
systems.
there’s
no
dispute
as
to
what
--
there’s
no
serious
question
as
to
what
the
rate
should
be
when
they
arranged
firm
transactions,
short-term
transactions.
it
is
agreed
that
gainesville
shall
pay
all
of
the
cost
of
making
the
interconnection.
but
the
court
took
the
position
that
because
gainesville
was
small
and
because
it
considered
that
gainesville
was
receiving
the
larger
part
of
the
benefits
that
there
must
be
some
other
charge
of
some
sort.
and
it
wasn’t
sufficient
to
accept
the
commission’s
principle
--
its
rule
that
when
interconnected
systems
operate
together,
it
is
the
duty
that
each
one
carry
its
proportionate
utility
responsibility
and
that
is
--
and
that
if
it
discharges
that
proportion
of
responsibility
it
has
provided
its
basic
cost
burden.
now,
what
the
commission
is
saying
is
this,
that
when
a
group
of
utilities
are
interconnected,
each
one
brings
some
load
to
the
interconnected
system.
and
that
load
say
a
100
megawatts
is
a
burden
on
the
interconnected
system.
therefore,
it
must
also
bring
some
generating
capacities
to
offset
the
load
which
it
brings
and
it
must
bring
generating
capacity
not
just
equal
to
its
load
but
it
must
be
something
greater.
it
must
bring
a
reserve
capacity
so
that
in
the
event
of
failure
of
generator,
there
will
be
other
generating
capacity
available
to
the
systems.
and
what
the
commission
here
is
saying
is,
that
if
gainesville
brings
that
capacity
to
the
interconnection
that
extra
capacity
that
reserve
capacity
to
the
interconnection
which
it
is
required
--
which
it
would
be
required
to
do
under
the
operating
criteria
of
the
florida
pool
as
each
system
under
the
florida
pool
is
required
to
do
then
it
would
meet
its
basic
responsibility
for
not
burdening
the
pool.
mr.
george
spiegel
oh,
yes,
yes.
when
the
energy
flows,
there
are
payments
and
likewise,
when
--
mr.
george
spiegel
no
question,
it’s
--
no
there
is
none
and
i
don’t
think
a
serious
question
on
that.
mr.
george
spiegel
that’s
right.
mr.
george
spiegel
that
is
correct
and
vice
versa.
in
other
words,
there’s
a
mutual
arrangement.
in
other
words,
we
agree
to
backup
florida
power
corporation
and
through
florida
power
corporation
supply
emergency
energy
to
any
system
that
needs
it.
and
likewise,
there
would
be
payments
from
florida
power
corporation.
mr.
george
spiegel
right.
mr.
george
spiegel
right.
mr.
george
spiegel
right.
under
those
circumstances,
we
could
not
supply
it
nor
will
we
be
required
to
supply
it?
mr.
george
spiegel
well,
the
switch
can
be
opened.
by
open,
it
means
--
mr.
george
spiegel
it
doesn’t
--
mr.
george
spiegel
if
i
understand
your
example.
you’re
assuming
that
florida
--
that
gainesville
has
a
load,
we’ll
say
a,
50
megawatts.
mr.
george
spiegel
that
even
though
it
has
a
100
megawatts
of
capacity
the
only
50
megawatts
is
then
operated,
--
mr.
george
spiegel
the
other
50
megawatts
is
been
down
on
forced
outage.
mr.
george
spiegel
and
the
power
company
will
ask
us
for
power
for
an
emergency
on
their
situation,
we
could
not
supply
it.
mr.
george
spiegel
now,
be
true
to
the
other
way.
mr.
george
spiegel
right.
mr.
george
spiegel
right.
mr.
george
spiegel
right,
like
consolidated
edison
new
york.
mr.
george
spiegel
that’s
right.
they
would
not
--
mr.
george
spiegel
that
is
my
understanding.
that
is
the
service
for
which
we
requested.
that
is
the
service
that
it
was
ordered.
mr.
george
spiegel
that
the
seller
and
seller
system
--
the
helping
system
doesn’t
help
the
other
system
--
mr.
george
spiegel
was
in
position
to
do
it.
now,
this
is
fundamental.
mr.
george
spiegel
there
is
and
the
court,
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
basic
errors
the
court
made
where
it,
i
think
it
tried
to
understand
the
electrical
arrangements
but
misunderstood
them.
mr.
george
spiegel
oh,
yes.
if
they
are
obligating
themselves
to
have
50,000
kilowatts
constantly
available
on
call
for
us
which
they
have
to
give
to
us
in
preference
to
their
own
customers
or
even
irrespective
of
whether
they
have
to
unload
their
own
customers,
then
you
would
have
a
fixed
to
standby
obligation.
mr.
george
spiegel
i
doubt
they
would
be
willing
to
sell
that
service
for
the
$3.08
per
kilowatt.
yes.
mr.
george
spiegel
it’s
an
animal
that
i
don’t
understand
in
terms
of
electrical
situation.
mr.
george
spiegel
if
they’re
obligating
themselves
on
a
firm
basis
to
have
the
generation
and
have
the
transmission,
then
it’s
an
obligation
that
runs
in
the
order
of
$20.00
to
$30.00
a
kilowatt
here.
mr.
george
spiegel
it
would
be
cheaper
for
us
to.
mr.
george
spiegel
the
thing
that
needs
to
be
emphasize
is
that
the
switch
and
the
control
where
the
operations
is
in
the
hands
first
of
all
of
the
dispatches
of
the
system
and
they
under
an
operating
committee
of
the
two
parties.
and
they
are
in
a
position
to
decide
when
and
under
what
circumstances
the
switches
to
be
opened
and
by
whom.
now,
the
basic
obligation
as
it
exist
in
the
agreements
which
a
matter
of
record
in
this
case
between
the
various
companies
all
say
the
same
thing.
they
say
that
when
you
receive
a
call
for
an
emergency,
you
shall
give
it
to
them
if
you
can
do
so
without
jeopardizing
your
own
service.
mr.
george
spiegel
and
they
further
provide
in
the
body
of
the
contracts
that
if
at
any
time
the
operations
of
the
other
party,
the
power
its
drawing
jeopardize
your
service,
you
have
a
right
to
open
the
switch.
and
the
commission’s
order
when
it
orders
emergency
service
here,
she
must
be
read
within
the
context
of
that
practice.
mr.
george
spiegel
that’s
right.
and
that’s
the
standards
throughout
the
industry
by
which
systems
interconnect.
now,
that
doesn’t
mean
that
this
thing,
that
the
kind
of
emergency
assistance
available
is
not
an
important
thing.
it’s
an
important
thing
because
what
happens
is
every
system
pulls
its
reserves.
that’s
why
it
got
co-insurance
arrangement
so
that
the
gainesville
reserves
plus
the
orlando
reserves
plus
the
jacksonville
reserves
are
available
to
anybody
in
the
group
that
needs
them.
mr.
george
spiegel
that’s
right.
in
other
words
the
probabilities
are
that
the
reserve
capacity
will
be
sufficient
and
the
systems
under
most
cases.
in
other
words,
they’ll
have
a
--
they’ll
make
calculations
the
law
that
probability
of
loss
calculations
for
total
system
and
they’ll
conclude
that
we
have
achieved
the
standard
so
that
load
will
not
exceed
available
capacity
more
than
one
day
in
10
years.
it’s
just
those
kinds
of
probabilities.
mr.
george
spiegel
the
whole
question
relates
to
compensation.
mr.
george
spiegel
not
for
the
power
that
is
given,
but
for
the
fact
that
the
power
is
available.
in
other
words,
--
mr.
george
spiegel
i’m
sorry
sir?
mr.
george
spiegel
they
get
the
compensation
when
the
power
flows.
mr.
george
spiegel
no,
the
issue
here
is
where
the
florida
power
corporation
should
be
compensated
when
the
power
is
not
flowing
because
under
that
theory
--
mr.
george
spiegel
yes.
mr.
george
spiegel
over
all,
over
all
yes.
mr.
george
spiegel
that’s
what
the
commission
has
passed
on.
mr.
george
spiegel
that’s
what
the
court
set
aside.
the
court
in
effect
prohibits
the
florida
power
commission
from
utilizing
this
rule
of
proportionate
utility
responsibility
and
it
says
that
this
is
an
adequate
based
upon
its
understanding
--
the
court’s
understanding
it
seems
to
me
of
how
electrical
systems
operate.
it
seems
to
me
a
clear
example
of
a
policy
factual
determination
which
has
been
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
experts,
the
federal
power
commission
and
should
be
allowed
to
stand
as
along
as
there
is
warrant
in
the
record.
as
long
as
the
commission’s
reasoning
is
adequate,
as
long
as
there’s
a
substantial
support
in
the
evidence.
mr.
george
spiegel
yes,
there
are.
mr.
george
spiegel
there’s
been
very
little
on
the
way
of
commission
orders.
this
is
practically
a
case
of
first
impression
of
this
type
of
interconnection.
now,
there
is
testimony
by
the
experts
of
the
staff
who’ve
examined
a
multitude
of
interconnection
arrangements
and
pooling
arrangements
throughout
the
country
and
they
say
in
effect
and
they
testify
in
effect
that
the
kind
of
standby
charge
that’s
here
being
recognized
is
contrary
to
the
general
practices
in
the
country.
now
the
court,
you
see,
reasons
that
a
firm
obligation
has
been
placed
upon
florida
power
corporation
even
though
the
commission
states
specifically
that
we
are
providing
no
firm
obligation,
no
firm
service.
and
so,
proceeding
from
that
the
erroneous
position
it
concludes
that
cost
are
being
placed
upon
--
fixed
cost
are
being
placed
upon
florida
power
corporation
which
the
commission
said
are
not.
and
proceeding
further,
the
court
then
tries
to
decide
or
does
decide
that
in
its
view
there
can
be
no
reciprocity
of
benefits
between
the
systems.
as
the
fifth
circuit
court
views
it
a
big
system
can
never
receive
benefits
from
a
small
system
and
all
the
benefits
go
on
the
other
way.
but
here
again
is
an
area
that
was
covered
in
the
evidence
and
it’s
covered
by
findings
of
the
commission
where
the
commission
determined
otherwise
that
there
are
benefits
falling
both
ways
even
though
one
system
is
smaller
than
the
other.
there
are
power
transactions
that
can
be
made.
there
is
the
availability
of
the
reserve
capacity
which
gainesville
will
have
and
actually,
the
court
determined
--
the
commission
indicates
that
these
benefits
can
be
very
substantial.
so,
here
again,
the
court
without,
i
believe,
reviewing
all
the
evidence
before
the
commission
has
substituted
its
view
on
the
facts
for
the
findings
which
the
commission
has
made.
and
i
think
the
case
is
as
simple
as
that
and
it
simply
is
an
area
in
which
the
commission
had
a
permissible
range
of
choices
where
it
has
developed
a
practice
and
a
policy
which
is
of
importance
in
this
case
and
could
well
be
of
importance
in
other
cases.
and
the
court
is
saying
that
it’s
beyond
their
authority
that
the
company
at
the
--
that
the
commission
is
in
error
on
the
facts.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
george
spiegel
it’s
hard
for
me
to
believe
that
we’re
talking
about
the
same
case.
there’s
an
interconnection
ordered
here
of
60
megawatts
and
when
you
evaluate
the
resources
on
each
side
of
that
interconnection,
the
likelihood
that
gainesville
can
supply
60,000
kilowatts
to
florida
power
corporation
when
florida
power
corporation
needs
it
is
probably
as
great
as
that
florida
power
corporation
can
supply
it
to
gainesville.
i
think
that’s
clear
on
the
record
here.
gainesville
has
a
reserve
right
now
of
60
megawatts
and
the
commission
found
in
the
course
of
the
years
it
would
have
reserves
running
in
the
order
of
40%
of
its
peak.
so
that’s
50,
60,
70
megawatts.
so
we
have
power
in
our
side
of
the
system
and
secondly
the
commission
found
that
our
units
though
smaller
but
because
they
are
smaller,
are
more
reliable.
our
outage
rate
is
much
less.
they
have
these
big
units.
they
are
probably
the
big
units
consolidated
edison
is
proud
of
its
big
units
but
the
big
units
have
higher
outage
rates.
mr.
george
spiegel
yes,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
any
system
tied
to
consolidate
with
edison
up
and
down
the
west
coast
to
a
small
east
coast.
small
system
is
not
receiving
help
from
edison
rather
it’s
drawn
down.
and
actually
a
report
issued
only
two
days
ago
by
the
federal
power
commission
indicates
a
very
serious
reserve
shortage
in
florida
for
both
florida
power
corporation
and
florida
power
and
light.
now,
this
report
shows
and
as
of
this
summer
they
expect
that
florida
power
corporation
will
have
something
in
the
order
of
5%
reserves.
mr.
george
spiegel
well,
that’s
the
point.
the
point
is
if
we
are
dedicating
per
kilowatt
more
transmission
actually
its
$3
million
worth
on
their
basis
than
they
are
dedicating
to
us.
so,
if
they
want
a
charge
us
$3.08,
i
suppose
we
should
be
charge
in
$4.50
and
right
off
in
that
basis.
mr.
george
spiegel
well,
if
that
will
make
it
bilateral
because
both
is
going
to
charge
for
everything
we
do
for
each
other.
but
you
have
to
recognize
that
what
you’re
dealing
with
is
a
pool.
you’re
not
just
dealing
with
two
companies
and
you
got
pool
operation
everybody
contributes
to
that
pool.
everybody
works
together
in
that
pool
when
somebody
has
a
big
problem
as
we
point
out
in
the
brief.
in
january
of
1969,
when
florida
power
and
light
lost
a
big
unit
then
southern
florida,
the
city
of
jacksonville
and
the
city
of
orlando
had
the
cut
load
in
order
to
keep
the
systems
alive.
mr.
george
spiegel
we
fought
it
up
before
the
commission.
mr.
george
spiegel
this
very
issue
the
commission
to
study
that
very
carefully
--
mr.
george
spiegel
i
don’t
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
george
spiegel
we
do
not.
mr.
george
spiegel
there
is
a
form
of
service
of
that
type.
mr.
george
spiegel
i
believe
that
there
are
rates
that
have
such
charges.
now,
that’s
true.
i
have
and
many
negotiations
have
always
opposed
such
charges
in
any
interconnection
arrangement
between
utilities
both
of
whom
have
their
own
generating
resources.
the
basic
position
that
we
always
have
taken
in
many
negotiations
and
in
many
contracts
is
that
if
we
supply
our
proportionate
share
of
the
reserve
and
make
it
available
to
the
other
side
on
equalize
basis,
we’re
making
our
contribution
by
our
investment
cost
in
the
facilities
themselves.
mr.
george
spiegel
yes,
all
the
parties
are
concerned
that
we
might
make
a
complaint
to
the
federal
power
commission.
now,
with
the
federal
power
commission
here
has
decided
this
important
question.
mr.
george
spiegel
this
is
the
first
interconnection,
full
interconnection
decision
by
the
federal
power
commission
between
two
generating
utilities.
now,
--
mr.
george
spiegel
no,
it’s
a
municipally
own
operation.
now,
this
big
--
mr.
george
spiegel
always.
now,
this
business
about
the
size,
the
compare
of
the
size
between
florida
power
corporation
and
gainesville
is
no
different
than
the
compare
of
the
size
between
orlando
and
florida
power
and
light
and
still
there
would
not
standby
arrangements
in
that
arrangement
and
in
the
subsequent
contracts.
thank
you.
mr.
george
spiegel
well,
procedurally
they’re
completely
separated?
mr.
george
spiegel
but
in
terms
of
the
subject
matter
they
are
the
same.
mr.
george
spiegel
yes.
mr.
george
spiegel
and
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
city
of
gainesville,
florida
operates
an
isolated
electric
system
serving
some
60,000
people
and
alachua
county,
florida
and
is
a
rapidly
growing
system
with
a
demand
doubling
every
five
years
in
a
concomitant
necessity
to
continue
to
build
additional
generating
facilities.
there
is
in
florida
and
there
was
at
the
time
in
1965
an
interconnected
system
of
five
utilities.
our
home
were
interconnected
with
each
other,
were
selling
power
back
and
forth
between
each
other
and
generally
applying
to
each
other
mutual
assistance
and
their
operations
in
general
were
guided
by
an
operating
committee
and
their
interconnections
were
founded
upon
bilateral
agreements.
the
city
of
gainesville
desires
to
interconnect
with
this
grid
or
this
pool
and
it
was
unable
to
negotiate
an
agreement
with
either
of
its
closest
neighbors,
florida
power
and
light
company
and
florida
power
corporation
and
accordingly
--
mr.
george
spiegel
no,
your
honor.
mr.
george
spiegel
yes,
during
world
war
ii,
there
was
an
emergency
interconnection
with
florida
power
corporation
which
was
severed
shortly
after
the
war.
we
commission
after
extents
of
hearings
under
section
202
(b)
of
the
federal
power
act
ordered
the
interconnection
and
fixed
the
terms
and
conditions
for
the
sale
of
energy
across
that
interconnection
and
for
the
responsibilities
which
gainesville
would
have
to
assume
by
way
of
providing
generating
capacity
reserves
to
the
interconnected
system.
and
in
general,
the
commission
fixed
the
same
pro
rata
terms
and
obligations
on
gainesville
as
what
exists
among
members
of
the
pool.
appeal
was
taken
--
a
petition
for
review
was
taken
to
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
by
florida
power
corporation.
mr.
george
spiegel
yes,
sir.
there
are
some
minor
differences
in
certain
of
individual
bilateral
contracts
but
in
general
they
are
the
same.
but
the
commission
does
require
that
gainesville
abide
by
the
operating
criteria
of
the
florida
operating
committee
precisely
the
same
as
other
systems.
three
issues
were
presented
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
first
issue
being
whether
the
commission
had
authority
to
order
the
interconnection
and
the
court
upheld
the
commission
on
that.
the
second
issue
was
whether
the
commission
should
be
required
to
condition
the
interconnection
upon
the
making
of
a
territorial
agreement
between
the
parties.
the
commission
had
declined
to
do
so
and
the
court
had
upheld
the
commission
on
that
issue.
the
only
question
on
which
--
the
third
question
and
the
only
question
on
which
the
court
reversed
was
as
to
a
single
aspect
of
the
compensation
arrangement.
there’s
no
disagreement
as
to
what
the
price
should
be
when
economy
energy
flows
through
the
system
between
a
systems.
there’s
no
dispute
as
to
what
--
there’s
no
serious
question
as
to
what
the
rate
should
be
when
they
arranged
firm
transactions,
short-term
transactions.
it
is
agreed
that
gainesville
shall
pay
all
of
the
cost
of
making
the
interconnection.
but
the
court
took
the
position
that
because
gainesville
was
small
and
because
it
considered
that
gainesville
was
receiving
the
larger
part
of
the
benefits
that
there
must
be
some
other
charge
of
some
sort.
and
it
wasn’t
sufficient
to
accept
the
commission’s
principle
--
its
rule
that
when
interconnected
systems
operate
together,
it
is
the
duty
that
each
one
carry
its
proportionate
utility
responsibility
and
that
is
--
and
that
if
it
discharges
that
proportion
of
responsibility
it
has
provided
its
basic
cost
burden.
now,
what
the
commission
is
saying
is
this,
that
when
a
group
of
utilities
are
interconnected,
each
one
brings
some
load
to
the
interconnected
system.
and
that
load
say
a
100
megawatts
is
a
burden
on
the
interconnected
system.
therefore,
it
must
also
bring
some
generating
capacities
to
offset
the
load
which
it
brings
and
it
must
bring
generating
capacity
not
just
equal
to
its
load
but
it
must
be
something
greater.
it
must
bring
a
reserve
capacity
so
that
in
the
event
of
failure
of
generator,
there
will
be
other
generating
capacity
available
to
the
systems.
and
what
the
commission
here
is
saying
is,
that
if
gainesville
brings
that
capacity
to
the
interconnection
that
extra
capacity
that
reserve
capacity
to
the
interconnection
which
it
is
required
--
which
it
would
be
required
to
do
under
the
operating
criteria
of
the
florida
pool
as
each
system
under
the
florida
pool
is
required
to
do
then
it
would
meet
its
basic
responsibility
for
not
burdening
the
pool.
mr.
george
spiegel
oh,
yes,
yes.
when
the
energy
flows,
there
are
payments
and
likewise,
when
--
mr.
george
spiegel
no
question,
it’s
--
no
there
is
none
and
i
don’t
think
a
serious
question
on
that.
mr.
george
spiegel
that’s
right.
mr.
george
spiegel
that
is
correct
and
vice
versa.
in
other
words,
there’s
a
mutual
arrangement.
in
other
words,
we
agree
to
backup
florida
power
corporation
and
through
florida
power
corporation
supply
emergency
energy
to
any
system
that
needs
it.
and
likewise,
there
would
be
payments
from
florida
power
corporation.
mr.
george
spiegel
right.
mr.
george
spiegel
right.
mr.
george
spiegel
right.
under
those
circumstances,
we
could
not
supply
it
nor
will
we
be
required
to
supply
it?
mr.
george
spiegel
well,
the
switch
can
be
opened.
by
open,
it
means
--
mr.
george
spiegel
it
doesn’t
--
mr.
george
spiegel
if
i
understand
your
example.
you’re
assuming
that
florida
--
that
gainesville
has
a
load,
we’ll
say
a,
50
megawatts.
mr.
george
spiegel
that
even
though
it
has
a
100
megawatts
of
capacity
the
only
50
megawatts
is
then
operated,
--
mr.
george
spiegel
the
other
50
megawatts
is
been
down
on
forced
outage.
mr.
george
spiegel
and
the
power
company
will
ask
us
for
power
for
an
emergency
on
their
situation,
we
could
not
supply
it.
mr.
george
spiegel
now,
be
true
to
the
other
way.
mr.
george
spiegel
right.
mr.
george
spiegel
right.
mr.
george
spiegel
right,
like
consolidated
edison
new
york.
mr.
george
spiegel
that’s
right.
they
would
not
--
mr.
george
spiegel
that
is
my
understanding.
that
is
the
service
for
which
we
requested.
that
is
the
service
that
it
was
ordered.
mr.
george
spiegel
that
the
seller
and
seller
system
--
the
helping
system
doesn’t
help
the
other
system
--
mr.
george
spiegel
was
in
position
to
do
it.
now,
this
is
fundamental.
mr.
george
spiegel
there
is
and
the
court,
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
basic
errors
the
court
made
where
it,
i
think
it
tried
to
understand
the
electrical
arrangements
but
misunderstood
them.
mr.
george
spiegel
oh,
yes.
if
they
are
obligating
themselves
to
have
50,000
kilowatts
constantly
available
on
call
for
us
which
they
have
to
give
to
us
in
preference
to
their
own
customers
or
even
irrespective
of
whether
they
have
to
unload
their
own
customers,
then
you
would
have
a
fixed
to
standby
obligation.
mr.
george
spiegel
i
doubt
they
would
be
willing
to
sell
that
service
for
the
$3.08
per
kilowatt.
yes.
mr.
george
spiegel
it’s
an
animal
that
i
don’t
understand
in
terms
of
electrical
situation.
mr.
george
spiegel
if
they’re
obligating
themselves
on
a
firm
basis
to
have
the
generation
and
have
the
transmission,
then
it’s
an
obligation
that
runs
in
the
order
of
$20.00
to
$30.00
a
kilowatt
here.
mr.
george
spiegel
it
would
be
cheaper
for
us
to.
mr.
george
spiegel
the
thing
that
needs
to
be
emphasize
is
that
the
switch
and
the
control
where
the
operations
is
in
the
hands
first
of
all
of
the
dispatches
of
the
system
and
they
under
an
operating
committee
of
the
two
parties.
and
they
are
in
a
position
to
decide
when
and
under
what
circumstances
the
switches
to
be
opened
and
by
whom.
now,
the
basic
obligation
as
it
exist
in
the
agreements
which
a
matter
of
record
in
this
case
between
the
various
companies
all
say
the
same
thing.
they
say
that
when
you
receive
a
call
for
an
emergency,
you
shall
give
it
to
them
if
you
can
do
so
without
jeopardizing
your
own
service.
mr.
george
spiegel
and
they
further
provide
in
the
body
of
the
contracts
that
if
at
any
time
the
operations
of
the
other
party,
the
power
its
drawing
jeopardize
your
service,
you
have
a
right
to
open
the
switch.
and
the
commission’s
order
when
it
orders
emergency
service
here,
she
must
be
read
within
the
context
of
that
practice.
mr.
george
spiegel
that’s
right.
and
that’s
the
standards
throughout
the
industry
by
which
systems
interconnect.
now,
that
doesn’t
mean
that
this
thing,
that
the
kind
of
emergency
assistance
available
is
not
an
important
thing.
it’s
an
important
thing
because
what
happens
is
every
system
pulls
its
reserves.
that’s
why
it
got
co-insurance
arrangement
so
that
the
gainesville
reserves
plus
the
orlando
reserves
plus
the
jacksonville
reserves
are
available
to
anybody
in
the
group
that
needs
them.
mr.
george
spiegel
that’s
right.
in
other
words
the
probabilities
are
that
the
reserve
capacity
will
be
sufficient
and
the
systems
under
most
cases.
in
other
words,
they’ll
have
a
--
they’ll
make
calculations
the
law
that
probability
of
loss
calculations
for
total
system
and
they’ll
conclude
that
we
have
achieved
the
standard
so
that
load
will
not
exceed
available
capacity
more
than
one
day
in
10
years.
it’s
just
those
kinds
of
probabilities.
mr.
george
spiegel
the
whole
question
relates
to
compensation.
mr.
george
spiegel
not
for
the
power
that
is
given,
but
for
the
fact
that
the
power
is
available.
in
other
words,
--
mr.
george
spiegel
i’m
sorry
sir?
mr.
george
spiegel
they
get
the
compensation
when
the
power
flows.
mr.
george
spiegel
no,
the
issue
here
is
where
the
florida
power
corporation
should
be
compensated
when
the
power
is
not
flowing
because
under
that
theory
--
mr.
george
spiegel
yes.
mr.
george
spiegel
over
all,
over
all
yes.
mr.
george
spiegel
that’s
what
the
commission
has
passed
on.
mr.
george
spiegel
that’s
what
the
court
set
aside.
the
court
in
effect
prohibits
the
florida
power
commission
from
utilizing
this
rule
of
proportionate
utility
responsibility
and
it
says
that
this
is
an
adequate
based
upon
its
understanding
--
the
court’s
understanding
it
seems
to
me
of
how
electrical
systems
operate.
it
seems
to
me
a
clear
example
of
a
policy
factual
determination
which
has
been
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
experts,
the
federal
power
commission
and
should
be
allowed
to
stand
as
along
as
there
is
warrant
in
the
record.
as
long
as
the
commission’s
reasoning
is
adequate,
as
long
as
there’s
a
substantial
support
in
the
evidence.
mr.
george
spiegel
yes,
there
are.
mr.
george
spiegel
there’s
been
very
little
on
the
way
of
commission
orders.
this
is
practically
a
case
of
first
impression
of
this
type
of
interconnection.
now,
there
is
testimony
by
the
experts
of
the
staff
who’ve
examined
a
multitude
of
interconnection
arrangements
and
pooling
arrangements
throughout
the
country
and
they
say
in
effect
and
they
testify
in
effect
that
the
kind
of
standby
charge
that’s
here
being
recognized
is
contrary
to
the
general
practices
in
the
country.
now
the
court,
you
see,
reasons
that
a
firm
obligation
has
been
placed
upon
florida
power
corporation
even
though
the
commission
states
specifically
that
we
are
providing
no
firm
obligation,
no
firm
service.
and
so,
proceeding
from
that
the
erroneous
position
it
concludes
that
cost
are
being
placed
upon
--
fixed
cost
are
being
placed
upon
florida
power
corporation
which
the
commission
said
are
not.
and
proceeding
further,
the
court
then
tries
to
decide
or
does
decide
that
in
its
view
there
can
be
no
reciprocity
of
benefits
between
the
systems.
as
the
fifth
circuit
court
views
it
a
big
system
can
never
receive
benefits
from
a
small
system
and
all
the
benefits
go
on
the
other
way.
but
here
again
is
an
area
that
was
covered
in
the
evidence
and
it’s
covered
by
findings
of
the
commission
where
the
commission
determined
otherwise
that
there
are
benefits
falling
both
ways
even
though
one
system
is
smaller
than
the
other.
there
are
power
transactions
that
can
be
made.
there
is
the
availability
of
the
reserve
capacity
which
gainesville
will
have
and
actually,
the
court
determined
--
the
commission
indicates
that
these
benefits
can
be
very
substantial.
so,
here
again,
the
court
without,
i
believe,
reviewing
all
the
evidence
before
the
commission
has
substituted
its
view
on
the
facts
for
the
findings
which
the
commission
has
made.
and
i
think
the
case
is
as
simple
as
that
and
it
simply
is
an
area
in
which
the
commission
had
a
permissible
range
of
choices
where
it
has
developed
a
practice
and
a
policy
which
is
of
importance
in
this
case
and
could
well
be
of
importance
in
other
cases.
and
the
court
is
saying
that
it’s
beyond
their
authority
that
the
company
at
the
--
that
the
commission
is
in
error
on
the
facts.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
george
spiegel
it’s
hard
for
me
to
believe
that
we’re
talking
about
the
same
case.
there’s
an
interconnection
ordered
here
of
60
megawatts
and
when
you
evaluate
the
resources
on
each
side
of
that
interconnection,
the
likelihood
that
gainesville
can
supply
60,000
kilowatts
to
florida
power
corporation
when
florida
power
corporation
needs
it
is
probably
as
great
as
that
florida
power
corporation
can
supply
it
to
gainesville.
i
think
that’s
clear
on
the
record
here.
gainesville
has
a
reserve
right
now
of
60
megawatts
and
the
commission
found
in
the
course
of
the
years
it
would
have
reserves
running
in
the
order
of
40%
of
its
peak.
so
that’s
50,
60,
70
megawatts.
so
we
have
power
in
our
side
of
the
system
and
secondly
the
commission
found
that
our
units
though
smaller
but
because
they
are
smaller,
are
more
reliable.
our
outage
rate
is
much
less.
they
have
these
big
units.
they
are
probably
the
big
units
consolidated
edison
is
proud
of
its
big
units
but
the
big
units
have
higher
outage
rates.
mr.
george
spiegel
yes,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
any
system
tied
to
consolidate
with
edison
up
and
down
the
west
coast
to
a
small
east
coast.
small
system
is
not
receiving
help
from
edison
rather
it’s
drawn
down.
and
actually
a
report
issued
only
two
days
ago
by
the
federal
power
commission
indicates
a
very
serious
reserve
shortage
in
florida
for
both
florida
power
corporation
and
florida
power
and
light.
now,
this
report
shows
and
as
of
this
summer
they
expect
that
florida
power
corporation
will
have
something
in
the
order
of
5%
reserves.
mr.
george
spiegel
well,
that’s
the
point.
the
point
is
if
we
are
dedicating
per
kilowatt
more
transmission
actually
its
$3
million
worth
on
their
basis
than
they
are
dedicating
to
us.
so,
if
they
want
a
charge
us
$3.08,
i
suppose
we
should
be
charge
in
$4.50
and
right
off
in
that
basis.
mr.
george
spiegel
well,
if
that
will
make
it
bilateral
because
both
is
going
to
charge
for
everything
we
do
for
each
other.
but
you
have
to
recognize
that
what
you’re
dealing
with
is
a
pool.
you’re
not
just
dealing
with
two
companies
and
you
got
pool
operation
everybody
contributes
to
that
pool.
everybody
works
together
in
that
pool
when
somebody
has
a
big
problem
as
we
point
out
in
the
brief.
in
january
of
1969,
when
florida
power
and
light
lost
a
big
unit
then
southern
florida,
the
city
of
jacksonville
and
the
city
of
orlando
had
the
cut
load
in
order
to
keep
the
systems
alive.
mr.
george
spiegel
we
fought
it
up
before
the
commission.
mr.
george
spiegel
this
very
issue
the
commission
to
study
that
very
carefully
--
mr.
george
spiegel
i
don’t
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
george
spiegel
we
do
not.
mr.
george
spiegel
there
is
a
form
of
service
of
that
type.
mr.
george
spiegel
i
believe
that
there
are
rates
that
have
such
charges.
now,
that’s
true.
i
have
and
many
negotiations
have
always
opposed
such
charges
in
any
interconnection
arrangement
between
utilities
both
of
whom
have
their
own
generating
resources.
the
basic
position
that
we
always
have
taken
in
many
negotiations
and
in
many
contracts
is
that
if
we
supply
our
proportionate
share
of
the
reserve
and
make
it
available
to
the
other
side
on
equalize
basis,
we’re
making
our
contribution
by
our
investment
cost
in
the
facilities
themselves.
mr.
george
spiegel
yes,
all
the
parties
are
concerned
that
we
might
make
a
complaint
to
the
federal
power
commission.
now,
with
the
federal
power
commission
here
has
decided
this
important
question.
mr.
george
spiegel
this
is
the
first
interconnection,
full
interconnection
decision
by
the
federal
power
commission
between
two
generating
utilities.
now,
--
mr.
george
spiegel
no,
it’s
a
municipally
own
operation.
now,
this
big
--
mr.
george
spiegel
always.
now,
this
business
about
the
size,
the
compare
of
the
size
between
florida
power
corporation
and
gainesville
is
no
different
than
the
compare
of
the
size
between
orlando
and
florida
power
and
light
and
still
there
would
not
standby
arrangements
in
that
arrangement
and
in
the
subsequent
contracts.
thank
you.
