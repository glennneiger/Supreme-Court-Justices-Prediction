black
but
isn’t
this
based
on
an
assumption
and
practical
experience
that
the
same
disaster
is
not
going
to
strike
all
the
members
of
the
pool
at
the
same
time
and
then
the
same
degree?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
the
sole
--
does
the
sole
question
here
relate
to
compensation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
the
power
that
they
get?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
there’s
a
power
to
get
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there’s
a
power
to
get
or
can’t
get
compensation
for
it,
isn’t
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that’s
right.
but
isn’t
that
the
issue
as
to
where
it’s
too
much
or
too
little?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
still
gets
back
i
suppose
in
the
question
where
the
compensation
is
too
much
and
too
little,
doesn’t
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
it
is.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that’s
what
the
commission
has
passed
on?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that’s
what
the
court
set
aside?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
is
the
power
--
florida
power
company
operate,
what
its
area?
justice
hugo
l.
black
down
to
miami
or
does
it
go
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that’s
florida
power
and
light?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
your
system,
what
is
your
system?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
generates
the
power?
justice
hugo
l.
black
florida
power?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they’re
all
in
florida?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
in
the
long
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
sum
total
of
this
is,
you
admit
that
the
gainesville
power
company
wants
to
buy
power
from
your
company?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
don’t.
they
want
you
to
give
it
to
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
free
standby
whether
they
get
power
from
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i’ve
understood
your
protection
but
do
they
get
power
from
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
they
get
power
from
you
at
any
time
under
any
circumstances?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
problem
here
that
the
power
commission
had
to
consider
was
how
much
they
have
pay
for
it,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that’s
the
issue?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that’s
the
only
issue.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
to
say
whenever
this
company
gets
into
power
from
you
the
commission
is
required
to
pay
cost
plus
10%.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that’s
what
you’re
complaining
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
if
is
the
cost
you’re
complaining
about
it?
and
they
have
to
pay
your
cost
plus
10%?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
aren’t
you
complaining
about
the
price
they
pay
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they’re
just
your
proposal,
the
cost
plus
10%?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
let’s
forget
get
those
words
a
minute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
you
sell
power,
has
the
commission
given
you
rate
of
cost
plus
10%?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
this
rate,
and
that’s
what
you
get
from
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
every
particle
of
power
they
use?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
in
five
years
as
you
say
cost
plus
10%
of
public
utility
is
not
enough?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
you
get
less
than
10%
profit,
can’t
you
complain
to
them
that
you’re
not
getting
price
they
fit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
the
power
company
has
taken
a
lead
in
the
commission?
make
them
sell
power
for
less
than
cost
plus
10%?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that’s
what
you
get.
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
gave
the
commission
the
cost
of
your
operation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
your
company?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
adopted
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
thought
you
said
they
arrange
you
get
10%
profit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
the
power
that
this
company
bought.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
we
didn’t
leave
out
of
that
to
due
the
cost
of
operation,
the
cost
of
your
whatever
that
is
standby
or
stop
by?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
the
gainesville
company
privately
owned?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
always?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
long
did
it
take
to
conduct
the
hearing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
long,
i
mean
the
volumes
of
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
as
i
understand
what
you’re
saying
is
they’re
not
required
to
keep
a
standby?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what’s
were
the
findings
of
the
commission
on
the
pool?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
court
of
appeals
said
that’s
a
finding
aside?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
commission
had
found
that
no
was
no
such
firm?
justice
hugo
l.
black
ordered
that
duty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
there’s
no
reason
from
your
experience
i
imagine
done
there
with
the
commission
to
imagine
if
it
does
show
up
anything
like
that,
the
company
won’t
call
it
to
the
attention.[laughing]
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
deny
what
mr.
gooch
says
about
the
firmness
of
the
requirements
you
have?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
you
deny
to
state
or
you
deny
what
the
commission
found
that
you
were
not
being
bound
to
supply
them
power?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
been
taking
and
drawing
a
contract,
if
there
are
some
ask
firmly
bound
to
do
something,
they’d
put
it
in
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it’s
filled.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
have
to
do
it
whether
you
want
to
do
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
horse
of
course
is
a
little
different.
justice
hugo

what
he

for
that
reason
that
they
were
not
entitled
to
recover
a
compensation
or
requirement
that
didn’t
exist.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
understood
him
to
argue,
he
maybe
wrong
--
i
maybe
wrong
in
understanding
him
or
he
maybe
wrong.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
talking
about
requirement,
would
you
require
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
you’d
be
entitled
to
pay
for?
justice
hugo
l.
black
imagine
if
you
had
a
--
they
admitted
the
demand
and
you
didn’t
supply
and
it
would
cost
a
lot
of
money,
you
could
then
find
more
reason
to
say
that
the
word
“firm”
would’ve
been
pretty
good
in
the
contract.
justice

are
