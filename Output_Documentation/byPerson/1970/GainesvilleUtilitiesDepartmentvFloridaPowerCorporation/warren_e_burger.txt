chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
464,
gainesville
utilities
against
florida
power
corporation.
counsel
may
i
inquire,
is
it
contemplated
that
464
and
469
will
be
interchangeably
argued
in
both
sets
of
arguments
or
are
you
going
to
have
them
completely
separated?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
i
realize
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
further
--
my
question
is,
specifically
in
the
next
hour
are
we
going
to
concern
ourselves
with
464?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready
mr.
spiegel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
i
suppose
there
are
great
many
agreements
--
pool
agreements
and
multilateral
and
bilateral
throughout
the
industry
and
the
country.
do
you
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
this
record
show
or
you
happened
to
know
whether
there
are
other
arrangements
of
this
kind
imposed
by
commission
order?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
spiegel.
mr.
emory.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
does
the
commission
order
differ
significantly
in
your
view
if
it
does
with
the
arrangements
you
have
with
the
other
members
of
the
pool?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
say
that
florida
power
doesn’t
have
any
benefit
out
of
this?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what’s
the
million
and
a
half
for
which?
what
are
you
saying
the
amount
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
have
an
impression
and
i
want
you
to
correct
it
if
it’s
wrong
that
gainesville
was
to
pay
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
--
can
it
be
made
a
condition
of
the
interconnection
order?
isn’t
that
this
posture
is
really
about?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
they
don’t
get
the
interconnection
isn’t
that
simply?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i’m
not
sure
i
follow
what
it
is
you
complain
about
in
that
situation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
speak
of
customers,
are
you
speaking
of
large
or
the
individual
householder?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
that
an
average
cost
by
a
numbers
or
are
you
talking
now
but
the
householder?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
how
does
the
connection
with
the
gainesville
add
to
your
burden
being
aside
whether
it
confers
any
benefit
on
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
many
people
are
there
in
the
pool
with
you
now,
the
bilateral
and
multilateral
contract
pool?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
now,
refresh
my
recollection
on
your
standby
arrangements
with
them.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
you
telling
us
the
probability
is
much
greater
that
it
will
be
a
one-way
street
with
gainesville
than
it
is
with
the
others?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
justice
white’s
question
to
you?
what
is
if
one
of
your
big
generators
burns
out
or
one
of
your
big
plants
gets
hit
by
lightning
or
whatnot?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
you
didn’t
need
them
as
justice
white’s
suggested,
you
could
under
this
order,
call
on
gainesville
for
its
reserve
power,
could
you
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
analogizing
this
mr.
emory
to
an
option
that
the
standby
agreement
--
the
standby
order
that
is
here
is
an
option
which
must
be
fulfilled
on
demand
and
then
you
say
that
option
is
in
of
itself
worth
something?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
an
option
i
was
assuming
it’s
a
firm
obligation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
emory,
if
i
follow
your
arguments,
you’re
saying
that
this
order
imposes
on
you
just
proportionate
burden
in
the
way
that
for
illustration
a
mutual
defense
pact
between
the
united
states
and
jamaica
or
guatemala?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it’s
all
one
way,
is
that
your
point?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
can’t
ever
help
you
but
you’re
bound
to
standby
24
hours
a
day,
365
days
a
year
to
help
them
if
they
need
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
was
the
evidence
on
the
reasonable
value
of
the
standby
$154,000.00?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
emory.
mr.
spiegel,
you
have
10
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
spiegel,
you
know
whether
gainesville
has
any
standby
arrangements
with
private
industrial
customers
who
maintain
their
own
generating
clients?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that’s
a
common
practice
though
in
the
industries,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
the
power
companies
charged
for
that
standby
service
just
a
standby?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that’s
all
was
in
the
context
for
the
parties
who
are
reaching
this
by
agreement
because
the
parties
themselves
see
a
mutuality
of
benefit,
isn’t
that
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
this
is
you
said
and
i
think
it
was
you
who
said,
“this
is
the
first
interconnection
of
this
kind?”
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
spiegel,
mr.
emory.
the
case
is
submitted.
we’ll
now
move
to
469,
federal
power
against
florida
power
corporation.
mr.
gooch,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
mean
the
transmission
line
or
whatever
facilities
go
with
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
what
you
are
--
are
you
saying
that
this
is
not
firm
in
the
sense
that
it’s
only
on
a
capacity
available
basis?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
firm
customers
of
florida
power
under
their
pool
agreements
or
otherwise
have
a
prior
claim
on
the
power
over
gainesville?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
won’t
know
anything
about
that
in
the
way
of
experience
until
they
have
some
interchange?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
gooch,
you
referred
to
the
expert
testimony
put
in
by
the
commission
on
staff,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
this
flow
that
would
be
from
gainesville
more
likely
to
the
florida
power,
was
that
disputed
or
was
that
undisputed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
gooch,
i
suppose
this
matter
remains
in
the
jurisdiction
in
the
commission
in
the
sense
that
if
two
years
from
now,
the
showing
can
be
made
under
the
experience
was
enacted
full
in
places
of
new
developments
not
now
in
the
record,
the
commission
it’s
all
to
its
order.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
gooch.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don’t
take
the
position
i
understand
that
it’s
impossible
that
gainesville
would
ever
be
called
upon
to
give
you
some
help?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
12
hours
notice,
6
hours
(voice
overlap)?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
emory.
mr.
gooch,
so
you
have
10
minutes.
chief
