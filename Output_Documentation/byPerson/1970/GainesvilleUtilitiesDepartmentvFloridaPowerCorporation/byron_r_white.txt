justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
spiegel,
was
the
city
ever
a
customer,
a
direct
customer
of
any
of
these
five
utilities?
justice
byron
r.
white
it’s
all
been
a
municipal
operated
situation?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
spiegel,
would
you
say
that
broadly
all
the
significant
conditions
for
gainesville
are
the
same
they
are
between
and
among
the
other
members
of
the
grid?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
new
--
wouldn’t
gainesville
have
to
pay
for
any
power
that
it
actually
used?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
--
and
there’s
no
question
about
the
adequacy
of
that
rate
as
a
rate
for
payment
for
that
power?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
really
do
pay?
you
do
--
under
the
federal
power
commission
order
you
would
do
more
than
just
bring
your
generating
capacity,
make
your
generating
capacity
available
to
the
system?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
be
paying
for
power
or
if
the
flow
in
your
direction
was
greater
than
the
flow
in
the
other
direction?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
way
of
--
what
is
the
arrangement,
what
is
the
practical
situation?
let’s
assume
that
your
system
was
using
all
the
power
you
had
with
right
within
the
system.
let’s
assume
when
your
generators
went
out
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
your
system
was
using
all
the
power
that
you
then
have.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
let’s
say
there
was
a
need
for
power
in
the
larger
system.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
be
the
--
you
just
wouldn’t
give
it
to
them
because
there’s
a
way
of
what
would
you
do,
cut
the
switch
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
what
you
would
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
what
you
would
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
will
set
in
that
--
and
i
take
it
that
would
be
true
the
other
way
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
need
or
suddenly
needed
power,
would
you
apparently
think
you
need
some
connections
to
take
care
of
emergencies?
if
you
--
if
there
was
an
emergency
in
the
gainesville
system
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
you
suddenly
needed
power
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
the
larger
system
has
then
overloaded
itself.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
you
--
they
could
not
furnish
you
the
power?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
have
no
obligation
constantly
to
be
to
--
to
be
on
stand
by
status
to
furnish
you
emergency
power?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
which?
justice
byron
r.
white
unless,
it’s
in
position
to
do
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
isn’t
that
quite
a
difference
between
the
litigants
in
this
case
on
that
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn’t
concede
or
would
you
concede
that
if
florida
power
render
an
obligation
to
maintain
a
capacity
which
under
any
circumstances
--
so
that
in
under
any
circumstance
does
it
could
furnish
you
emergency
needs
for
power
that
it
maybe
you
should
do
something
more
than
pay
for
power?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you’re
saying
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
and
you
wouldn’t
to
expect
to
buy
it
for
that,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you’re
saying
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
and
they
might
be
cheaper
for
you
to
build
your
own.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you’re
saying
--
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
saying
even
though
the
right
is
only
for
emergency
power,
it’s
only
when
the
power
is
to
take
you
to
the
other
system?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
emory,
but
you
don’t
have
to
build
or
maintain
the
cost
of
disconnection
any
more
capacity
than
(voice
overlap)?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
one
customer
has
not
been
figured
any
obligation
in
view
of
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
when
you
run
out
of
capacity
when
you
have
necessary
that
nobody
in
connection?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
did
they
make
the
connection?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you’re
not
suggesting
it’s
an
order
you’re
making
connection.
of
course
you
build
at
your
expense
and
capacity.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
just
want
to
pay
this
power.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
only
as
long
as
you
got
the
some
power,
it’s
fair?
justice
byron
r.
white
let’s
just
assume
that
one
of
your
big
generators
goes
down
and
that
your
reserve
capacity
that
you’re
maintaining
to
guard
against
failure
which
is
why
you
maintain
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
let’s
assume
you
have
a
failure
and
you
have
to
use
your
generating
--
your
reserve
generating
capacity
to
satisfy
your
normal
load.
are
you
suggesting
that
in
that
situation,
there’s
no
way
would
you
keep
it
--
serve
it
parties
in
gainesville
power,
it
did
also
have
an
emergency?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
can
get
their
own.
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
true
whether
you
have
negative
gains
or
whatever?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
didn’t
say
that
maybe
the
commission
didn’t
hold
to
pay
if
they
were
getting
that
power
for
nothing.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
wait
a
minute.
they
pay
a
certain
amount
for
the
power
that’s
used.
and
do
they
pay
any
less
than
yours
--
than
anybody
else
paying
for
power?
if
you
want
to
pay
more
than
the
normal
rate
for
power
in
order
to
compensate
you,
would
they
pay?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
say
as
to
your
other
customers
to
share
on
that
free
trial
standby?
isn’t
that
included
in
the
rate
that
they
now
pay?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now
why
isn’t
included
in
the
rate
of
gainesville?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
charge
the
gainesville
for
the
power
they
purchased,
that
they
actually
get
them
the
same
rate
as
others
are
paying,
would
there
still
be
free
trial
evidence,
why
is
it
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
pay
you
a
rate.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
includes
the
provision
for
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
now
the
rate
would
be
charge
to
gainesville
as
exactly
the
same?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
your
cost
which
includes
--
justice
byron
r.
white
a
normal
rate
making
calculation?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
cost
it?
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
i
thought
you
would
you
maintain
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
shouldn’t
they
pay
for
anything
more
than
the
power
they
actually
use
when
they’re
going
to
maintain
the
standby
capacity
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
i
should
pay
is
what
the
other
passengers
are
paying.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i
don’t
--
all
i
like
to
pay
is
for
my
ride,
i
don’t
like
to
pay
the
airline
when
the
airplane
is
empty
than
sitting
an
overload.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
much
of
the
customers?
justice
byron
r.
white
charge
to
gainesville?
justice
byron
r.
white
what’s
that
mean?
the
others
would
get
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
the
customer
doesn’t
pay
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
does
the
company
if
in
a
particular
year
gainesville
didn’t
take
whatever
these
units
power
hour,
you
wouldn’t
be
getting
anything
cost
plus
10%
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you
want
in
that
view
on
the
government
side
as
long
there
is
$154,000.00
from
gainesville
to
help
to
pay
for
substantial?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
mr.
emory,
going
back
though
the
florida
power
and
light
where
you
have
an
interconnect,
you
are
performing
standby
service
for
them
and
they
for
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
what
each
one
pays
to
the
other
is
the
mutuality
of
service
so
to
speak?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
isn’t
a
dime
that
flows
across.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
so
far
as
gainesville
is
concerned,
isn’t
the
same
thing
on
them
what’s
lesser
degree?
justice
byron
r.
white
i’ll
repeat
my
question,
isn’t
the
difference
one
between
10
megawatts
or
whatever
it
is
ends
a
much
larger
thing?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
again,
isn’t
a
matter
just
to
degree
between
gainesville
on
one
hand
that
florida
p
and
l
on
the
other?
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
gainesville
could
provide
200
to
300,
you
wouldn’t
be
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
explain
to
us.
justice
byron
r.
white
it’s
15,
75,
100?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
put
this
way,
when
the
agreements
under
a
couple
of
hundred,
would
anyone
could
provide
or
something
less?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
hundred
is
as
much
as
they
can
provide?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course
you,
you
held
a
complaint
if
you
have
a
hundred
gainesville
wanting
standby,
i
take
it
your
position
it
should
be
locked
in
already,
wouldn’t
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
higher
than
you
for
the
backup
or
perhaps
more
from
that,
it
would
be
by
you
up
next?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
aren’t
you
asking
for
standby
charge?
justice
byron
r.
white
perhaps,
you
can
come
out
pretty
well.
justice
byron
r.
white
incidentally,
i
gather
you
brought
this
all
out
before
the
commission?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
anything
said
here
that
wasn’t
said
before
the
commission?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
happens
if
one
of
the
florida
power,
other
connections
has
a
need
for
florida
power
standby
power
and
is
using
it
but
then
gainesville
comes
along
and
need
some,
it
can’t
get
it,
can
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
you
say
that
they
have
the
right
to
refuse
it
or
to
turn
out
or
to
open
the
switch?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
the
city
of
gainesville
is
already
using
it?
let’s
say
the
city
of
gainesville
has
an
outage
in
it
is
using
florida
power’s
reserve
and
is
using
it
and
then
there
are
some
other
connection
of
florida
power’s
system
needs
them
also
has
the
same
need
that
gainesville
has.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
florida
power
can’t
provide
them
both?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i’m
talking
about
just
one
of
their
(voice
overlaps)
another
system.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
the
pool?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
gooch,
has
the
commission
ever
approved
the
interconnection
where
something
more
or
some
payment
is
provided
more
than
just
for
the
power
when
as
used?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understood
from
mr.
emory,
perhaps
i
misunderstood
him
that
some
of
their
connections
were
paying
more
than,
it’s
going
to
cost
gainesville?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
another
system?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
a
firm
customer?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
it
was
so
i
suppose
there’s
two
ways
of
carrier?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
there
was
nothing?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
could
also
that
like
gainesville
had
some
fewer
needs
for
the
power.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
of
its
regular
needs
it
was
under
an
obligation
to
maintain
its
power.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
wouldn’t
have
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
type
of
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
spiegel,
was
the
city
ever
a
customer,
a
direct

of

justice
byron

white
it’s

members

how
about
the
new
--
wouldn’t
gainesville
have
to
pay
for
any
power
that
it
actually

what
--
and
there’s
no

about
the

and
then
let’s

there

for
power
in
the
larger
system.
justice
byron

white
what
would
be
the
--
you

yes.

i
will
set
in
that
--
and
i
take
it
that
would
be
true
the
other

justice

white
if
you
need
or

needed
power,
would
you
apparently
think
you
need
some
connections
to
take
care
of
emergencies?
if
you
--
if
there
was
an
emergency
in
the
gainesville
system
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
you
suddenly
needed
power
--
justice
byron

white
--
and
the
larger
system
has
then
overloaded
itself.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
you
--
they
could
not
furnish
you
the
power?
justice
byron

white
they
have
no
obligation
constantly
to
be
to
--
to
be
on

to
furnish
you
emergency
power?
justice

of
which?
justice
byron

white
unless,
it’s
in
position
to
do
so?
justice

now,
isn’t

that

you’re
saying
--

yes
and
you
wouldn’t

for

to
build
your

justice

how
about
that?
justice
byron

white
what
you’re

--
justice

are
you
saying
even
though
the

is
only
for
emergency
power,
it’s
only
when
the
power
is
to
take
you
to
the
other
system?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
emory,
but
you
don’t
have
to
build
or
maintain
the
cost
of
disconnection
any
more
capacity
than
(voice
overlap)?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
one
customer
has
not
been
figured
any
obligation
in
view
of
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
when
you
run
out
of
capacity
when
you
have
necessary
that
nobody
in
connection?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
did
they
make
the
connection?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you’re
not
suggesting
it’s
an
order
you’re
making
connection.
of
course
you
build
at
your
expense
and
capacity.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
just
want
to
pay
this
power.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
only
as
long
as
you
got
the
some
power,
it’s
fair?
justice
byron
r.
white
let’s
just
assume
that
one
of
your
big
generators
goes
down
and
that
your
reserve
capacity
that
you’re
maintaining
to
guard
against
failure
which
is
why
you
maintain
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
let’s
assume
you
have
a
failure
and
you
have
to
use
your
generating
--
your
reserve
generating
capacity
to
satisfy
your
normal
load.
are
you
suggesting
that
in
that
situation,
there’s
no
way
would
you
keep
it
--
serve
it
parties
in
gainesville
power,
it
did
also
have
an
emergency?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
can
get
their
own.
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
true
whether
you
have
negative
gains
or
whatever?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
didn’t
say
that
maybe
the
commission
didn’t
hold
to
pay
if
they
were
getting
that
power
for
nothing.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
wait
a
minute.
they
pay
a
certain
amount
for
the
power
that’s
used.
and
do
they
pay
any
less
than
yours
--
than
anybody
else
paying
for
power?
if
you
want
to
pay
more
than
the
normal
rate
for
power
in
order
to
compensate
you,
would
they
pay?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
say
as
to
your
other
customers
to
share
on
that
free
trial
standby?
isn’t
that
included
in
the
rate
that
they
now
pay?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now
why
isn’t
included
in
the
rate
of
gainesville?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
charge
the
gainesville
for
the
power
they
purchased,
that
they
actually
get
them
the
same
rate
as
others
are
paying,
would
there
still
be
free
trial
evidence,
why
is
it
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
pay
you
a
rate.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
includes
the
provision
for
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
now
the
rate
would
be
charge
to
gainesville
as
exactly
the
same?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
your
cost
which
includes
--
justice
byron
r.
white
a
normal
rate
making
calculation?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
cost
it?
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
i
thought
you
would
you
maintain
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
shouldn’t
they
pay
for
anything
more
than
the
power
they
actually
use
when
they’re
going
to
maintain
the
standby
capacity
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
i
should
pay
is
what
the
other
passengers
are
paying.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i
don’t
--
all
i
like
to
pay
is
for
my
ride,
i
don’t
like
to
pay
the
airline
when
the
airplane
is
empty
than
sitting
an
overload.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
much
of
the
customers?
justice
byron
r.
white
charge
to
gainesville?
justice
byron
r.
white
what’s
that
mean?
the
others
would
get
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
the
customer
doesn’t
pay
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
does
the
company
if
in
a
particular
year
gainesville
didn’t
take
whatever
these
units
power
hour,
you
wouldn’t
be
getting
anything
cost
plus
10%
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you
want
in
that
view
on
the
government
side
as
long
there
is
$154,000.00
from
gainesville
to
help
to
pay
for
substantial?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
mr.
emory,
going
back
though
the
florida
power
and
light
where
you
have
an
interconnect,
you
are
performing
standby
service
for
them
and
they
for
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
what
each
one
pays
to
the
other
is
the
mutuality
of
service
so
to
speak?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
isn’t
a
dime
that
flows
across.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
so
far
as
gainesville
is
concerned,
isn’t
the
same
thing
on
them
what’s
lesser
degree?
justice
byron
r.
white
i’ll
repeat
my
question,
isn’t
the
difference
one
between
10
megawatts
or
whatever
it
is
ends
a
much
larger
thing?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
again,
isn’t
a
matter
just
to
degree
between
gainesville
on
one
hand
that
florida
p
and
l
on
the
other?
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
gainesville
could
provide
200
to
300,
you
wouldn’t
be
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
explain
to
us.
justice
byron
r.
white
it’s
15,
75,
100?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
put
this
way,
when
the
agreements
under
a
couple
of
hundred,
would
anyone
could
provide
or
something
less?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
hundred
is
as
much
as
they
can
provide?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course
you,
you
held
a
complaint
if
you
have
a
hundred
gainesville
wanting
standby,
i
take
it
your
position
it
should
be
locked
in
already,
wouldn’t
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
higher
than
you
for
the
backup
or
perhaps
more
from
that,
it
would
be
by
you
up
next?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
aren’t
you
asking
for
standby
charge?
justice
byron
r.
white
perhaps,
you
can
come
out
pretty
well.
justice
byron
r.
white
incidentally,
i
gather
you
brought
this
all
out
before
the
commission?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
anything
said
here
that
wasn’t
said
before
the
commission?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
happens
if
one
of
the
florida
power,
other
connections
has
a
need
for
florida
power
standby
power
and
is
using
it
but
then
gainesville
comes
along
and
need
some,
it
can’t
get
it,
can
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
you
say
that
they
have
the
right
to
refuse
it
or
to
turn
out
or
to
open
the
switch?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
the
city
of
gainesville
is
already
using
it?
let’s
say
the
city
of
gainesville
has
an
outage
in
it
is
using
florida
power’s
reserve
and
is
using
it
and
then
there
are
some
other
connection
of
florida
power’s
system
needs
them
also
has
the
same
need
that
gainesville
has.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
florida
power
can’t
provide
them
both?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i’m
talking
about
just
one
of
their
(voice
overlaps)
another
system.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
the
pool?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
gooch,
has
the
commission
ever
approved
the
interconnection
where
something
more
or
some
payment
is
provided
more
than
just
for
the
power
when
as
used?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understood
from
mr.
emory,
perhaps
i
misunderstood
him
that
some
of
their
connections
were
paying
more
than,
it’s
going
to
cost
gainesville?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
another
system?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
a
firm
customer?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
it
was
so
i
suppose
there’s
two
ways
of
carrier?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
there
was
nothing?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
could
also
that
like
gainesville
had
some
fewer
needs
for
the
power.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
of
its
regular
needs
it
was
under
an
obligation
to
maintain
its
power.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
wouldn’t
have
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
type
of
(inaudible)
