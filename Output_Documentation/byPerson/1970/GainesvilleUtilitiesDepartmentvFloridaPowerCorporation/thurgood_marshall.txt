in
gainesville?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
whole
point,
what
it
seems
to
worry
me
at
least
a
little
bit
is
assuming
in
the
next
five
years,
gainesville
never
needs
to
close
the
switch
and
they
would
still
be
paying
like
insurance,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
as
of
now
starting
(inaudible)
but
if
they
pay
for
the
connection,
you
don’t
put
out
anything
in
dollars
and
cents.
they
can
still
they
draw
out
some
electricity,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
that
increase
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall

wouldn’t
any
increase?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
gainesville
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
you
ask

justice
thurgood
marshall
we’re
having
forth
the
price
that
gainesville
paid
this
money
and
catching
on
the
line
for
the
--
that
brought
the
cost
to
the
consumer
of
florida
power.
i
know
that’s
an
important
volume.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
did
it
actually
mean
that
the

--
electricity
rates

justice
thurgood
marshall
whether
there’s
a
sudden
breakdown
of
the
generator
in
gainesville,
would
the
committee
be?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
is
it
right
now,
well
assuming

the
order
of
the
federal
power
commission
to
put
it
into
effect.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
