mr.
richard
w.
emory
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
i’d
like
to
state
that
this
case
doesn’t
involve
whether
there
should
or
should
not
be
a
connection
because
florida
power
corporation
has
been
offering
to
interconnect
voluntarily
ever
since
the
case
began.
and
i’ve
filed
in
our
brief
exhibit
40,
which
is
the
interconnection
agreement
which
we
offered.
we
are
opposed
to
a
force
connection
or
a
connection
ordered
by
the
commission
which
we
feel
doesn’t
meet
the
statutory
standards
of
necessary
or
appropriate
in
the
public
interest
and
not
an
undue
burden
on
our
system.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
your
honor,
these
arrangements
with
other
members
of
the
pool
are
based
on
mutuality
or
reciprocity
of
service
benefits.
we
have
two
other
arrangements
with
other
systems
where
there
are
special
payments
provided
for.
we
have
an
arrangement
with
golf
power
company
where
florida
power
corporation
is
playing
golf
$5.80
a
kilowatt
per
year
and
we’re
only
asking
for
$3.08
here.
it
all
depends
on
whether
the
arrangement
or
the
interconnection
has
mutual
service
benefits.
if
it
doesn’t
have
mutual
service
benefits,
there
should
be
something
to
offset
that
lack
of
mutuality
and
this
is
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
we
can’t
see
where
we
would
get
anything
out
of
this
interconnection.
in
fact,
we
think
that
we
would
be
seriously
criticized
if
we
even
considered
spending
the
million
and
a
half
dollars
that
gainesville
proposes
to
spend
on
the
interconnection.
the
florida
public
service
commission
would
criticize
us
for
wasting
our
money
and
the
consumers
would
criticize
us
for
wasting
our
money
and
that
gets
down
to
understanding
what
does
interconnection
does.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
that
is
the
cost
of
gainesville
estimated
the
cost
of
the
interconnection
to
our
system
would
be
a
million
and
a
half
dollars.
the
federal
power
commission
found
$3
million
but
there
isn’t
anything
in
the
record
to
support
this
extremely.
but
we
don’t
care
what
it
cos.
we
don’t
think
that
we
could
--
would
be
justified
in
spending
any
money
on
it
because
all
of
these
to
our
system
is
a
burden.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
they
are
to
pay
that
and
they
say
that
will
be
a
burden
but
they
will
pay
it
because
they
are
ordered
to.
they’ll
pay
it
because
they
want
to
because
they’re
not
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
power
commission.
this
order
has
no
real
effect
upon
them.
they’re
outside
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
power
commission.
so,
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
well
that
they
pay
for
it,
yes.
but
suppose
they
don’t
want
to
build
it.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
that’s
right.
so,
if
they
build
it,
it
will
be
because
they
want
to.
that’s
my
point.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
we
complain
that
where
our
system
is
going
to
be
required
to
subsidize
and
support
their
system
and
give
them
substantial
financial
benefits
that
their
own
witness
estimate
it
would
be
worth
$520,000.00
a
year
to
their
system
and
we
pay
the
whole
cost
of
standby
service
for
both
systems.
now,
our
customers
and
this
is
--
it’s
important
to
understand
what
“standby”
is.
all
large
power
systems
had
to
have
an
over
capacity
to
take
advantage
of
emergencies,
that’s
obvious.
it’s
just
like
having
a
fire
department
in
a
city.
you
got
have
a
certain
amount
of
over
capacity
and
you
got
to
be
able
to
get
that
over
capacity
to
any
part
of
the
system
wherever
you
have
a
power
shortage.
now,
we
have
a
$65
million
transmission
line
going
half
the
length
of
florida.
this
system
serves
the
west
coast
of
florida
back
from
st.
petersburg
up
to
the
georgia
line
and
in
then
to
central
florida.
we
have
a
$65
million
transmission
line
that
cost
us
$13
million
a
year
to
main
own
and
maintain
and
operate.
now,
there’s
no
time
to
open
or
close
switches.
these
emergencies
happened
like
that
if
the
power
isn’t
supply
within
1/20th
of
a
second.
one
1/20th
of
a
second,
you’re
going
to
have
a
brownout
or
blackout.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
no,
we
don’t,
but
in
not
for
this
one
customer
and
this
is
why
we’re
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
not
this
one
customer,
that’s
right.
if
you
give
him
a
free
hour,
transmission
system
can
take
care
of
gainesville
without
any
additional
capacity.
but
what
about
the
next
customer
and
that
we
got
a
lot
of
municipal
systems
in
florida.
we’re
serving
12
at
wholesale.
we’re
serving
nine
rea’s.
suppose
they
all
want
free
standby.
now,
our
customers
we
figure
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
oh,
it
isn’t
that’s
simple,
your
honor.
we
--
if
we
can’t
do
it,
we
have
to
provide
capacity
and
for
anybody
with
whom
we’re
interconnected.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
well,
if
the
federal
power
commission
orders
us
to,
we
do.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
no,
the
statute
does
restrict
them
against
ordering
us
to
do
anything
that
would
require
any
addition
to
our
system.
but
let’s
look
at
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
our
customers.
we
figure
that
this
build
in
to
our
system
of
cost
of
$3.20
a
kilowatt
for
standby
in
our
transmission
line.
every
customer
on
our
system
in
his
rates
has
that
build
in
to
his
rates
as
one
element
of
cost.
now,
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
retail
customers
and
wholesale
customers,
everybody.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
well,
i’m
not
talking
--
i
haven’t
broken
this
down
for
how
much
power
any
one
person
should
use.
this
is
based
on
our
load.
we
have
a
load
of
1,500
megawatts.
we
figure
this
is
what
it
cost
on
a
total
load
basis
and
we
have
to
recover
that
money
somewhere,
we
haven’t
broken
it
down
for
an
individual
customer.
but
take
one
of
the
cities
that
we’re
serving
wholesale.
we
serve
them
power
--
they
buy
power
from
us.
in
their
rate,
is
built-in
the
cost
of
our
transmission
system
and
our
standby
capability
and
they
pay
for
it.
now,
gainesville
wants
it
for
nothing
and
we
think
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
well,
that’s
right
but
that’s
--
we
pay
for
the
power
if
we
buy
it
from
them,
but
what’s
going
to
happen
is
and
you
got
to
understand.
this
interconnection
inevitably
unavoidably
will
result
in
us
protecting
them
at
all
hours
of
the
day
and
night
against
any
outage
on
their
system,
the
testimony.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
no,
we
cannot
operate
our
system
in
a
way
that
i
wouldn’t
protect
them
except
for
opening
the
switch
which
the
federal
power
commission
says
you
can
do.
we
have
to
have
--
mr.
justice
white,
it
really
is
this.
our
system
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
that’s
right.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
it’s
conceivable
in
some
great
crisis
if
we
have
enough
loss
of
generation
we
might
have
to
cut
off
everybody
--
a
lot
of
people
and
that
to
cut
off
some
of
our
own
customers.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
oh,
we
can
cut
off
--
we
can
cut
them
off.
(voice
overlap)
but
in
any
normal
operation
we
have
to
protect
against
loss
of
400
or
500
megawatts.
and
we
have
to
have
that
spinning.
that
has
to
be
an
operation
all
the
time
and
it
has
to
be
available
within
one
1/20th
of
a
second.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
that’s
right.
but
what
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
it
does
not
add
to
our
burden.
we
cannot
deny
that
but
what
we
say,
anybody
and
everybody
who
connects
to
our
transmission
system
ought
to
pay
its
fair
share
of
the
cost.
i
mean
they
shouldn’t
get
a
free
ride.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
well,
the
only
ones
that
i
know
are
florida
power
and
light,
tampa
electric,
orlando
and
jacksonville.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
we
do
not
have
any
similar
standby
arrangement
with
them
because
we
have
what
we
envisage
mutuality
of
service
arrangements.
i
mean
if
we
lose
a
couple
of
hundred
megawatts,
they
can
supply
it
to
us
the
same
way
if
they
lose
a
couple
of
hundred
megawatts
we
can
supply
to
them.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
we’d
say
would
be
a
complete
one-way
street
here
whereas
with
the
others
it’s
a
mutual
street,
it’s
a
two-way
street.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
well,
we
have
those
things
happened
and
so
far
as
i
know,
we’ve
never
--
we’ve
been
able
to
take
care
of
all
them
that
i
know
about.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
your
honor,
gainesville
couldn’t
supply
enough
to
see.
i
mean,
it
wouldn’t
merely
do
us
any
good,
the
most
that
they
can
supply
in
instantaneous
power
if
they
had
everything
running
and
they
admit
that
they
wouldn’t
run
everything,
it
would
be
about
10
megawatts.
and
for
a
system
that
needs
400
or
500,
the
10
we
can’t
see.
now,
furthermore
in
our
planning
and
operation
of
our
system,
we
and
this
is
why
they
mean
nothing
to
us,
we
include
30
or
40
megawatts
as
a
margin
of
error
in
planning
our
system
and
then
the
operation
of
our
system.
we
couldn’t
change
our
method
of
operation
because
of
gainesville,
because
they
can’t
supply
enough
to
provide
any
mutuality
to
this
interconnection
or
any
reciprocity
to
this
interconnection.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
none,
whatsoever
except,
they
have
a
number
of
interconnection
agreements.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
no,
not
there
is
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
have
several.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
yes,
they
just
said
that
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
no,
we
are
asking
for
no
higher
charge
for
power.
we
are
asking
them
to
bear
a
fair
share
of
the
cost
of
our
standby
for
the
amount
of
the
standby
that
they’re
going
to
use.
we
say
that
this
standby
or
our
built-in
excess
capacity
which
is
going
to
protect
both
systems
cost
us
$3.20
per
kilowatt
per
year.
if
you
pay
your
fair
share
of
the
cost
of
that
based
on
the
demands
that
you’re
putting
on
the
excess
capacity
on
our
system
and
the
demands
that
we’re
putting
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
that’s
right.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
because
there’s
no
provision
for
it,
that’s
what
we’re
complaining.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
well,
because
the
other
people
not
only
pay
for
the
power
that
they
get
based
on
complicated,
etcetera.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
you’re
right,
they
pay
a
rate.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
that’s
right.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
no,
it
isn’t
it
does
not
include
any
provisions
for
standby,
that’s
our
whole
point.
it
doesn’t,
it
only
includes
when
they
take
power
they
pay
5
cents
per
kilowatt
plus
a
low
energy
charge.
actually,
they
get
it
cheaper
because
they
get
it
at
our
cost
plus
10%.
they
get
what
we
call
an
interchange
rate.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
plus
10%.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
yes.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
that
will
compensate
us
for
when
they’re
taking
power
across
the
interconnection
but
it
will
not
compensate
us
for
maintaining
this
large
transmission
system.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
that’s
right,
but
we
--
if
they
want
to
use
it
why
shouldn’t
they
pay
for
it?
mr.
richard
w.
emory
well,
your
honor
it’s
the
same
--
it’s
this
situation.
if
you
go
into
an
airline
and
they
have
an
empty
seat,
do
you
contend
that
you
should
take
--
get
a
free
ride?
if
you
go
to
a
hotel
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
that’s
all
we’re
asking
them.
we’re
asking
to
pay
exactly
what
our
customers
pay.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
no.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
that’s
right.
we
say
it’s
more
than
an
option.
we
say
it’s
an
absolute
firm
obligation
that
we
can’t
escape.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
and
it’s
a
firm
obligation
and
once
you
make
that
connection
and
close
the
switch
in
order
the
switch
kept
closed,
we’re
going
to
be
standing
there
with
the
standby.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
we
have
one
that
i
know
of
since
the
case
--
it’s
not
in
the
record
who
is
paying
the
standby.
now,
i
like
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
well,
it’s
like
insurance
make
sense
your
honor,
that’s
right,
but
the
switch
is
closed.
the
power
--
federal
power
commission
ordered
the
switch
kept
closed
and
unless
the
switch
is
kept
closed,
this
arrangement
is
no
good
to
them.
it’s
only
good
to
them
because
the
switch
is
closed
and
if
they
have
any
generating
outage
or
generating
deficiency,
they
will
be
automatically
protected.
if
they
weren’t
going
to
close
the
switch,
they
shouldn’t
pay
for
standby.
i
would
agree
with
that.
but
when
they
close
the
switch
and
keep
the
switch
closed
and
impose
upon
us
the
burden
to
protecting
them,
we
think
they
ought
to
pay
their
fair
share.
now,
if
what
we
ask
isn’t
a
fair
share,
we’re
probably
willing
to
listen
to
what’s
reasonable,
but
the
federal
power
commission
just
if
evaded
this.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
no,
i
don’t
agree
with
that.
we
are
paying
about
$13
million
a
year
for
our
backbone
transmission
network.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
no,
we
would
be
paying
that
anyway.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
we
won’t
increase,
but
we
say
we
should
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
--
subsidize
them.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
we
are
asking
that
we
not
be
required
to
subsidize
them
because
if
we
provide
them
with
free
standby,
and
we
think
that
that’s
exactly
what
we’re
doing.
now,
there
is
a
case
i
like
to
refer
to
that’s
not
in
this
brief.
the
colorado
interstate
gas
company
versus
federal
power
commission,
324
u.s.
581
and
at
page
615,
in
a
concurring
opinion
by
mr.
justice
jackson
and
this
case
involved
gas
rates
--
natural
gas
rates
and
whether
industrial
customers
should
get
a
lower
rate
than
some
municipal
customers
on
the
same
theory
that
they
weren’t
adding
to
the
cost.
in
other
words,
it
wouldn’t
going
to
cost
anymore
to
serve
them,
therefore,
they
should
give
a
cheap
incremental
rate.
and
mr.
justice
jackson
said,
“i
do
not
think
it
can
be
accepted
as
a
principle
of
public
regulation
that
industrial
gas
may
have
a
free
ride
because
the
pipeline
and
compressor
have
to
operate
anyway,
any
more
than
we
can
say
that
a
big
customer
should
have
a
free
ride
for
his
coal
because
the
train
runs
anyway.”
now,
we
feel
that
that
fits
this
case
exactly,
we’re
going
to
provide
standby
that
will
protect
both
of
the
systems.
we
can’t
avoid
it.
it’s
an
inevitable
consequence
of
this
interconnection.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
that’s
right.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
well,
presumably
they
contribute
all
of
it.
what
we’re
talking
about
is
an
averaging.
of
course,
with
--
this
was
a
hundred
we’re
talking
about
charging
them
$154,000.00.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
that’s
all
we’re
talking
about.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
the
maintenance.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
if
you
could
fine
a
$154,000.00
in
our
rate
structure,
our
customers
would
be
entitled
to
$154,000.00
rate
reduction
theoretically.
it
goes
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
that’s
right.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
no,
wait
actually
we
propose
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
no,
we’re
not
complaining
about
that
your
honor,
in
fact
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
no,
actually
that
price
was
recommended
by
us
to
the
commission.
the
commission
took
our
proposal
on
that.
we
are
complaining
that
they
don’t
pay
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
no,
we
complain
that
they
are
not
paying
anything
for
the
free
standby
when
they
are
not
taking
power.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
yes.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
in
this
interchange
arrangement.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
yes.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
that’s
right.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
it’s
not
--
it
is
not
compensatory
if
we’ve
got
to
maintain
the
firehouse,
the
fire
station
24
hours
a
day,
365
days
out
of
the
year
to
protect
their
system
and
our
system.
if
that
was
all
we
were
giving
them
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
well,
your
honor
we’re
--
our
cost
is
not
limited
to
the
cost
of
the
power
that
we
deliver
to
them.
our
cost
is
the
cost
of
maintaining
this
transmission
system.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
well,
we’re
not
complaining
about
the
charge
for
the
power
to
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
we’re
complaining
that
there
was
no
provision
in
here
to
provide
for
standby.
now,
the
commission
has
allowed
the
federal
government’s
standby,
they’ve
allowed
the
southeastern
power
administration
$2.75
a
kilowatt.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
that’s
right.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
that’s
right
and
that’s
as
simple
as
that.
now,
the
chairman
of
the
federal
power
commission
in
testifying
before
congress
in
1967
on
the
--
what
is
known
as
title
iii
of
the
federal
power
act
which
was
never
passed
was
asked
by
senator
monroney
and
this
is
all
about
standby.
senator
monroney:
i
mean
at
the
time,
he
is
not
selling
it.
the
“it”
being
power,
at
the
time
he
is
not
selling
it
does
not
receive
remuneration
for
the
extra
standby
capability
he
has.
mr.
white:
mr.
white
being
the
chairman
of
federal
power
commission.
he
might
be
paid
for
the
capability,
yes.
in
other
words,
in
order
to
protect
the
system,
you
contract
with
your
neighbor
who
says,
“under
these
circumstances,
i
will
provide
you
the
necessary
energy,
if
the
worst
scenario
comes
to
pass,
you
have
to
pay
for
that
right
for
his
commitment
to
you
to
meet
your
needs
when
you
need
help
either
by
making
a
money
payment
or
by
making
the
same
electrical
service
available
to
him.”
so
the
answer
is
yes,
you
are
paid
for
that
and
frankly
it
is
good
business
from
both
points
of
view.
senator
monroney:
in
other
words,
you
are
paid
for
the
standby
capability
even
though
it
is
not
used.
mr.
white,
chairman
of
the
federal
power
commission:
yes.
senator
monroney:
you
would
have
that
for
maybe
two
or
three
years
and
maybe
never
need
the
power,
but
for
only
a
day
or
two.
mr.
white:
that
is
correct.
and
under
the
isolated
system,
they
have
to
have
standby
power
available
unless
they
want
their
customers
to
go
without
service
in
the
event
of
a
disturbance.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
that’s
right.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
no,
me
too.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
no,
because
in
gainesville’s
case,
there’s
nothing
really
that
can
flow
across.
they
can’t
provide
enough
of
this
standby
capacity
to
even
for
us
to
even
take
in
the
consideration.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
in
hundreds.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
if
it
is
a
matter
of
degree
except
to
the
degree
is
so
small
that
it
becomes
meaningless.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
oh,
no.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
well,
i
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
your
honor,
it’s
hard
to
know
because
all
these
agreements
are
pretty
complicated,
they’re
all
negotiated,
they
all
involved
a
lot
of
factors
and
there’s
certain
going
to
be
enough
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
of
instantaneous,
yes
with
orlando
but
we’re
buying
a
hundred
megawatts
from
them
regularly,
i
think.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
well,
that
is
a
firm
purchase
on
their
fit.
i
don’t
think
they
could
provide
it
but
depend
on
what
they
had
operating
and
i
do
have
to
do
some
arithmetic.
they
--
i
don’t
know
whether
they
could
provide
40
or
50
megawatts
of
standby,
i’m
not
sure,
instantaneously.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
no.
but
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
well,
i
say,
it
would
save
our
customers
$154,000.00
a
year
which
would
go
in
to
our
earnings.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
well,
if
you
could
find
a
hundred
and
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
well,
this
probably
wouldn’t
affect
federal
power
rates.
it
would
affect
our
domestic
or
interstate
--
intrastate
rates.
it
would
be
one
fact
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
they’ve
been
dropping
regularly
every
year.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
well,
what
they
say
they
want
is
50
megawatts
such
as
the
size
of
their
largest
unit
and
their
actual
testimony
is
we
need
and
want
emergency
backup
service
in
the
amount
of
our
largest
unit
which
is
50
megawatts.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
we
have
two
or
three.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
i
guess.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
that’s
right.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
that’s
right,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
we
had
two
engineering
witness
made
this
estimate.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
yes.
--
no,
he
was
an
independent
--
well,
he
was
hired
consultant.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
no,
they
just
ignored
it.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
although,
that’s
on
the
power
they
sell
on
the
standby,
they
didn’t.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
well
on
that
they
just
took
our
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
no,
we
have
no
standby
charge
in
that
your
honor.
none.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
$154,000.00
mr.
richard
w.
emory
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
this
honorable
court.
i
think
it’s
important
to
understand
what
standby
is
and
i
don’t
think
that
that
is
really
yet
understood.
mr.
justice
marshall
referred
to
it
as
insurance
and
that
in
the
sense
is
what
it
is.
maybe
a
better
definition
it’s
the
order
in
the
pipes
all
around
the
city
of
washington
where
you
have
fire
hydrants
and
you
got
quite
complicated
system
of
water
pipes
and
fire
hydrants
and
somebody
is
paying
for
those
water
pipes
and
those
fire
hydrants
and
the
order
that’s
in
there
and
that
is
what
florida
power
is
paying
for
and
what
we
say
we’re
not
going
to
get
any
compensation.
we’re
paying
for
the
fire
department,
the
fire
engines,
the
firemen,
the
water
pipes
and
the
water
and
it’s
there
at
all
hours
of
the
day
and
night
and
it’s
constantly
available.
now,
we
feel
one
of
the
reasons
this
has
never
come
up
before.
this
is
the
first
time
the
federal
power
commission
has
ever
come
up
with
this
idea
of
relative
burden,
burden
sharing,
burdens
and
proportion
to
size.
they’ve
never
--
nobody
had
ever,
ever
dreamed
of
such
a
theory.
as
far
as
i
know,
you
can’t
find
it
anywhere
and
any
of
their
decisions
in
the
one
decision
that
they
had
on
the
subject,
they
said
that
charges
across
an
interconnection
should
be
based
on
the
reciprocity
and
mutual
exchange
of
services.
and
the
cases
or
the
rights
that
have
come
up
sense
actually
until
this
came
along
they
really
hadn’t
passed
on
any
rates.
they
hadn’t
had
it
force
interconnection
case
and
what
we
think
makes
this
highly
unfair
and
highly
discriminatory
where
the
federal
government
agencies
southeastern
power
authority
which
is
an
agency
of
the
department
of
interior
has
come
in
with
the
same
kind
of
standby
charge
request,
they’ve
been
allowed.
they
are
getting
$2.75
of
kilowatt
per
year
for
standby.
they
have
a
100
megawatts
of
reserve
and
they
are
selling
it
to
three
people
on
how
really,
a
when
as
and
if
available
basis
and
the
contract
say,
that
anyone
of
the
other
three
are
using
it,
it’s
too
bad
though
you
can’t
get
it
but
this
is
being
paid
for
every
hour
of
the
day
or
night.
now,
when
they
actually
take
power
if
they
should
have
a
breakdown
and
start
taking
power,
they
stop
paying
this
$2.75
and
i
think
they’re
paying
$9.00
or
$10.00
and
a
half.
they
pay
a
higher
rate,
but
in
addition
to
what
they
--
in
addition
to
paying
for
what
they
take,
they
pay
for
the
fire
department,
they
pay
for
the
pipes
that
are
in
the
ground
and
the
water
that’s
at
all
time
is
there.
now,
gainesville
--
something
to
say
about
gainesville
maintaining
this
15%
reserve.
let
me
show
you
how
ridiculous
that
is,
they
had
a
112%
reserve
when
we
tried
this
case
and
they
propose
by
tying
in
to
our
transmission
system
and
relying
on
us
to
reduce
that
reserve
to
15%.
and
what
is
15%?
they
got
100
megawatts
of
demand.
we’re
talking
about
15-megawatt
reserve
and
here
we
need
the
500
instantaneously
and
they’re
going
to
reduce
the
reserve
from
112%
to
15%
and
they
talk
about
that
being
a
burden.
and
to
me,
it
just
doesn’t
make
any
sense
at
all.
now,
the
one
expert
who
heard
all
the
whiteness
and
the
testimony
in
this
case
was
the
trial
examiner
and
he
decided
this
case
right
down
the
line
for
us
100%.
now,
he
decided
that
there
should
definitely
be
some
charge
for
standby
that
it
was
well-recognized
in
the
industry
that
where
you
pay
for
--
where
you
provide
a
service
for
which
you
get
no
return,
there
should
be
some
charge.
and
it
is
also
not
uncommon
in
these
interconnection
arrangements
to
split
the
benefits
--
you
decide
what
the
savings
are
and
one
fellow
it
gets
half
and
the
other
gets
half
and
he
proposed
that
standby
be
paid
for
by
splitting
of
the
financial
savings.
we
don’t
object
to
that,
actually,
we
think
that
would
cost
gainesville
more
than
what
we
propose
to
charge.
although,
it’s
never
been
fully
price
status
but
it’s
a
perfectly
to
be
reasonable
proposal
and
it
is
a
proposal
that’s
used
many
of
these
interconnection
arrangements.
now,
there’s
something
been
said
about
our
customers
having
a
prior
claim
over
gainesville
for
the
standby.
your
honors,
that
is
just
ignores
the
physical
facts
of
how
electricity
operates.
we
cannot
even
subordinate
the
demands
of
our
customer
to
gainesville.
we
got
this
large
transmission
system
if
you
look
at
exhibit
32,
which
is
a
map
of
which,
you’ll
see
that
it’s
a
pretty
large
thing.
and
that
is
a
big
electric
transmission
system
that’s
charged
at
all
hours
to
the
day
and
night
to
feed
any
demands
for
current
off
of
it.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
absolutely,
we
think
we
can
--
it
will
be
just
as
firm
as
it
can
be
and
the
gainesville
witnesses
admitted
that.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
i
deny
the
statement
and
i
deny
what
the
commission
found.
i
think
saying
that
we
will
not
be
under
a
firm
obligation
to
supply
the
standby
just
to
play
on
words.
you
don’t
write
the
word
firm
in
there
that’s
what
they
say.
we
didn’t
put
in
the
word
firm.
you
don’t
need
to
put
in
the
word
firm
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
well,
you
don’t
have
to
put
the
word
firm
in.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
no,
you
just
sign
the
contract,
“i
hereby
agree
to
buy
a
horse.”
you
don’t
see,
“i
hereby
firmly
agree
to
buy
horse.”
and
that’s
what
we’re
talking
about
here.
they
said,
“you
let
gainesville
tack
your
transmission
system.”
mr.
richard
w.
emory
whether
you
want
to
do
it
and
not.
and
the
mere
fact
they
could
puts
us
under
a
firm
obligation
to
supply
them
whether
they
call
it
firm
or
call
it
nothing.
and
it’s
the
same
i
buy
--
i
promise
buy
a
horse
or
i
firmly
promise
to
buy
a
horse.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
well,
that’s
what
we’re
talking
about,
whether
they
use
the
word
or
don’t
use
the
word
that’s
all
into.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
your
honor,
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
i
don’t
think
and
i’m
trying
to
recollect.
i
don’t
think
the
word
“firm”
was
ever
used
in
connection
with
the
standby.
i
think
they
talked
about
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
there
is
no
firm
obligation
to
supply
what
in
the
industry
has
called
firm
power
--
firm
service.
i
agree
to
buy
100
kilowatts
from
you
for
the
next
three
months.
that
is
called
“firm
power.”
there
is
no
obligation
in
this
agreement
to
have
a
selling
“firm
power”
and
there’s
one
reason
and
only
one
reason.
if
they
ever
put
that
in
their
order,
that
would
require
us
to
enlarge
our
generating
facilities
or
would
give
us
an
argument
that
it
will
require
us
to
(voice
overlap).
mr.
richard
w.
emory
then
we
would
be
entitled
to
say
that
they
didn’t
have
any
jurisdiction
because
they
don’t
have
jurisdiction
to
do
anything
that
would
definitely
positively
require
us
to
enlarge
our
facilities.
now,
this
word
“firm”
in
connection
with
standby,
i’m
not
sure
that
the
commission
ever
used
the
word
or
didn’t
use
the
word
because
actually
as
i
say,
you
don’t
need
to
use
the
word.
it’s
a
meaningless
word.
we
are
firmly
bound
where
they
say
so
are
not.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
well,
your
honor
we
can
envisage,
we
sincerely
honestly
cannot
envisage.
they’re
making
a
demand
that
we
won’t
supply
and
the
commission
noticed
that
and
gainesville
knows
that.
how
could
they
reduce
their
reserve
from
112%
of
15%
down
to
15
megawatts
if
they
didn’t
feel
that
they’re
generating
capability
was
going
to
be
firmly
protected?
they
would
be
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
but
they’re
planning
to
eliminate
the
supply
for
themselves.
they’re
going
to
rely
on
us
to
supply
and
the
commission
would
be
derelict
in
their
duty
if
they
said,
gainesville
can
reduce
its
reserve
by
about
a
100%
if
they
didn’t
feel
that
florida
power
was
going
to
be
supply
that
and
they
know
we’re
going
to
supply
it.
and
in
the
case
of
the
southeastern
power
administration
and
the
southwestern
power
administration
and
other
agencies
they
recognize
that.
now,
one
of
the
real
reasons,
i
think
maybe
this
case
was
argued
separately,
i
don’t
know
was
the
government
took
quite
of
different
position
in
their
brief
in
what
gainesville
did.
gainesville
said
the
question
in
this
case
was
whether
they
should
be
made
to
pay
for
benefits
received
in
addition
to
reimbursing
us
for
cost.
well,
we
say
they
aren’t
reimbursing
us
for
cost
much
less
paying
us
for
benefits
received.
the
government
took
the
position
that
their
relative
burdens,
they
either
that
gainesville
supported
us
in
proportion
to
its
size
that
should
be
enough.
and
we
say
proportion
to
size
in
this
case
is
meaningless.
they
also
argued
in
their
brief
and
mr.
gooch
made
a
remarkable
statement
in
his
argument
that
the
federal
power
commission
doesn’t
have
to
pay
any
attention
to
commission
practice.
i
mean
industry
practice,
but
in
their
brief,
they
acknowledged
that
the
vast
majority
of
interconnection
between
utilities
are
effective
voluntarily.
in
contest
to
interconnection
cases
therefore
and
this
is
the
first
contested
interconnection
case
that’s
ever
got
--
hasn’t
been
settled.
there
have
been
about
two
or
three
others,
but
they
have
been
always
been
settled.
it
is
appropriate
that
commission
just
issues
for
establishing
compensation
terms
take
into
account
the
terms
of
current
interconnection
agreements
arranged
at
arm’s-length.
in
other
words,
what
they
said
was,
we
don’t
have
any
expertise,
we’ve
never
been
faced
with
this
problem
before.
therefore,
we
will
look
and
see
what
the
industry
has
been
doing
and
every
time
you
have
given
them
an
example
of
what
the
industry
is
doing,
they
said,
“that’s
not
applicable,
that’s
not
the
same
case.”
none
of
these
cases
are
the
same.
none
of
them
are
identical
almost
every
interconnection
arrangement
is
different.
now,
mr.
spiegel
in
his
reply
brief
referred
to
interconnection
we
have
at
tallahassee
which
was
put
in
after
this
case
so
it’s
not
in
the
record.
he
says,
“we’re
not
charging
them
for
standby.
we
are
not
charging
them
for
standby
for
two
reasons
and
there
may
be
others.”
one
is
the
interconnection
is
too
small
for
us
to
supply
them
standby.
and
the
second
reason,
they
have
built
some
transmission
for
us
so
we’re
getting
some
transmission
from
them.
all
of
these
things
had
been
done
in
arm’s-length.
they’re
all
based
on
an
evaluation
of
what
the
various
equities
are
and
if
there’s
mutuality
or
any
relative
or
reasonable
mutuality
and
what
each
party
is
doing
for
the
other,
you
don’t
have
a
special
charge.
but
if
one
fellow
is
doing
nothing,
but
getting
a
free
ride,
it’s
standard
to
have
him
pay
some
reasonable
compensation
and
if
you
don’t
do
that
and
the
government
argues
you’re
going
to
des
--
you
don’t
follow
their
position,
you’re
going
to
destroy
the
incentive
for
interconnections.
we
say
if
you
don’t
provide
some
mutuality
or
reimbursement
or
compensation
that
will
destroy
the
incentive.
what
incentive
that
we
got
to
interconnect
with
gainesville
or
any
number
of
other
municipalities?
do
you
think
i’m
just
take
a
free
ride
off
of
our
backs.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
that’s
what
i
told
you,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
this
is
something
that
i
didn’t
know
a
thing
about
until
i
got
this
brief
on
monday
and
i
really
don’t
know
much
about
it.
i
asked
the
company
--
the
terms
of
that
and
it’s
a
small
connection.
i
guess
we’re
supplying
them
power
or
they
are
selling
us
power,
i
really
don’t
know.
we’re
selling
i’m
told
that
we’re
selling
them
some
firm
capacity
in
other
words,
they
are
buying
10
megawatts,
20
megawatts
whatever
it
is
and
for
standby
they
need
50
or
60
megawatts.
they’re
buying
some
power
from
us
if
they
could
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
that’s
municipally-owned.
the
municipal
ownership
has
no
problem
here.
we
were
interconnected
with
orlando
have
been
for
years.
we’re
interconnected
with
--
through
florida
power
and
light
with
jacksonville
which
is
a
municipal
system.
those
municipal
systems
are
member
of
our
operating
group.
but
are
there
paying
anyway?
we’re
not
objecting
to
the
fact
that
this
is
a
municipal,
that
doesn’t
bother
us.
we
say
that
we
shouldn’t
do
it
for
nothing.
now,
as
they
say
the
industry
practice
is
definitely
and
positively
to
arrange
for
some
mutuality
and
if
there’s
not
mutuality
to
have
an
exchange
of
compensation.
now,
i’ll
read
one
more
thing
out
of
the
brief.
the
report
to
the
president
of
the
federal
power
commission
on
the
prevention
of
power
failures
and
it
recited
this
matter
of
the
problem
of
interconnections
and
the
necessity
for
interconnections
to
provide
reliability
of
service
particularly
the
small
systems.
and
after
pointing
out
the
importance
to
small
systems,
it
said
that
the
same
time
the
users
must
contribute
their
proper
share
of
the
cost.
it’s
the
federal
power
commission
talking
before
they
decided
this
case
and
going
on
they
talked
about
factors
that
should
be
taken
into
account
“this
is
the
federal
power
commission
reporting
to
the
president
to
the
extent
that
it
may
be
physically
impossible
for
small
system
to
fulfill
all
such
obligations
in
kind,
equalization
should
take
the
form
of
exchanging
power
or
dollars
among
systems.
no
formula
have
been
accepted
as
universal
applicable
to
these
situations.
a
wide
range
of
pertinent
factors
are
being
considered
such
as
relative
benefits,
methods
or
participation,
reliability
of
service,
conservation
of
natural
resources,
alternative
opportunities
and
broad
equities.”
now,
that
is
really
all
we’re
asking
to
do
to
put
their
pocketbook
so
to
speak
where
they
must
is
and
do
what
they
say
they’re
going
to
do
and
what
they
have
allowed
federal
agencies
to
do
and
the
be
fair
to
our
system
and
to
our
customers
who,
if
gainesville
gets
a
free
ride,
are
going
to
bear
the
whole
cost.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
they
might
be
called
upon
to
give
us
help
over
time
and
that’s
important
and
i’m
glad
you
asked
that
question.
any
help
that
you
give
overtime
no
matter
what
amount
of
time
if
it
is
instantaneous
is
no
trade
for
the
help
that
you
need
instantaneously
because
every
system
has
generation
that
they
can
start
up
and
give
you
overtime
if
you
had
time
to
react.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
well,
actually
they
would
take
two
hours
notice
on
most
of
their
equipment.
that’s
just
not
the
equivalent
if
we
got
two
hours
notice,
we
can
start
up
our
own
generators.
we
got
a
lot
of
generators
that
aren’t
operating
all
the
time
if
we
have
--
maybe
if
we
have
10
minutes,
we
can
start
up
or
two
hours.
now
we
--
they
as
far
as
overtime
is
concerned
until
they
get
down
to
this
reserve
if
they
reduce
their
reserve
down
to
15%,
anything
they
can
give
us
overtime
is
not
worth
anything.
but
as
long
as
they
have
this
100%
reserve,
or
they
could
give
us
maybe
50
or
60
megawatts
overtime
and
divide
that
testimony
over
two
hours.
but
by
the
time
two
hours
had
expired,
they
got
little
unit,
your
honor,
that
a
5
megawatts,
one
of
them
is
1megawatt,
14
megawatts,
we
may
have
125-megawatt
unit
sitting
around
at
overtime,
we
can
start
up
and
not
need
florida
power
and
light,
orlando,
all
the
other
systems,
they’re
interconnected
with
overtime.
and
i
would
like
to
say
one
more
thing
and
that
is
about,
this
business
of
their
--
the
testimony
mr.
gooch
was
asked
about
the
testimony
of
florida
power
relying
on
this
interconnection
whether
it
was
disputed.
they
put
a
man
on
the
stand
and
made
some
computer
studies
and
he
took
the
florida
power
system
and
he
treated
as
independent
system
with
no
interconnections
with
anybody
and
he
found
that
we
wouldn’t
have
enough
power
to
meet
our
peak
load
or
something
like
25
days
out
of
the
year.
this
is
all
in
the
briefs,
then
he
said,
he
got
another
study
it
may
help
you
time
in
with
gainesville,
they
will
only
--
they
won’t
be
able
to
meet
their
peak
load
19
times
of
the
year.
so
therefore,
they’re
going
to
rely
very
heavily
on
this
interconnection.
he
assumed
and
we
had
no
connections
that
we
couldn’t
call
on
florida
power
and
light,
we
couldn’t
call
on
the
tampa,
we
couldn’t
call
on
orlando,
couldn’t
call
on
jacksonville.
actually,
we
don’t
have
these
deficiencies,
we
can
meet
our
peak
load
unless
we
have
big
outages
everyday
in
the
year
and
this
really,
it’s
such
a
theoretical
study,
it’s
almost
absurd
and
the
examiner
really
cut
off
my
if
you
look
at
the
record
and
it’s
in
their,
he
really
cut
off
my
cross-examination
on
that.
he
said,
it’s
the
first
time
i
have
heard
enough
about
that
because
he
saw
how
ridiculous
it
was.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
i’d
like
to
state
that
this
case
doesn’t
involve
whether
there
should
or
should
not
be
a
connection
because
florida
power
corporation
has
been
offering
to
interconnect
voluntarily
ever
since
the
case
began.
and
i’ve
filed
in
our
brief
exhibit
40,
which
is
the
interconnection
agreement
which
we
offered.
we
are
opposed
to
a
force
connection
or
a
connection
ordered
by
the
commission
which
we
feel
doesn’t
meet
the
statutory
standards
of
necessary
or
appropriate
in
the
public
interest
and
not
an
undue
burden
on
our
system.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
your
honor,
these
arrangements
with
other
members
of
the
pool
are
based
on
mutuality
or
reciprocity
of
service
benefits.
we
have
two
other
arrangements
with
other
systems
where
there
are
special
payments
provided
for.
we
have
an
arrangement
with
golf
power
company
where
florida
power
corporation
is
playing
golf
$5.80
a
kilowatt
per
year
and
we’re
only
asking
for
$3.08
here.
it
all
depends
on
whether
the
arrangement
or
the
interconnection
has
mutual
service
benefits.
if
it
doesn’t
have
mutual
service
benefits,
there
should
be
something
to
offset
that
lack
of
mutuality
and
this
is
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
we
can’t
see
where
we
would
get
anything
out
of
this
interconnection.
in
fact,
we
think
that
we
would
be
seriously
criticized
if
we
even
considered
spending
the
million
and
a
half
dollars
that
gainesville
proposes
to
spend
on
the
interconnection.
the
florida
public
service
commission
would
criticize
us
for
wasting
our
money
and
the
consumers
would
criticize
us
for
wasting
our
money
and
that
gets
down
to
understanding
what
does
interconnection
does.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
that
is
the
cost
of
gainesville
estimated
the
cost
of
the
interconnection
to
our
system
would
be
a
million
and
a
half
dollars.
the
federal
power
commission
found
$3
million
but
there
isn’t
anything
in
the
record
to
support
this
extremely.
but
we
don’t
care
what
it
cos.
we
don’t
think
that
we
could
--
would
be
justified
in
spending
any
money
on
it
because
all
of
these
to
our
system
is
a
burden.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
they
are
to
pay
that
and
they
say
that
will
be
a
burden
but
they
will
pay
it
because
they
are
ordered
to.
they’ll
pay
it
because
they
want
to
because
they’re
not
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
power
commission.
this
order
has
no
real
effect
upon
them.
they’re
outside
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
power
commission.
so,
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
well
that
they
pay
for
it,
yes.
but
suppose
they
don’t
want
to
build
it.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
that’s
right.
so,
if
they
build
it,
it
will
be
because
they
want
to.
that’s
my
point.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
we
complain
that
where
our
system
is
going
to
be
required
to
subsidize
and
support
their
system
and
give
them
substantial
financial
benefits
that
their
own
witness
estimate
it
would
be
worth
$520,000.00
a
year
to
their
system
and
we
pay
the
whole
cost
of
standby
service
for
both
systems.
now,
our
customers
and
this
is
--
it’s
important
to
understand
what
“standby”
is.
all
large
power
systems
had
to
have
an
over
capacity
to
take
advantage
of
emergencies,
that’s
obvious.
it’s
just
like
having
a
fire
department
in
a
city.
you
got
have
a
certain
amount
of
over
capacity
and
you
got
to
be
able
to
get
that
over
capacity
to
any
part
of
the
system
wherever
you
have
a
power
shortage.
now,
we
have
a
$65
million
transmission
line
going
half
the
length
of
florida.
this
system
serves
the
west
coast
of
florida
back
from
st.
petersburg
up
to
the
georgia
line
and
in
then
to
central
florida.
we
have
a
$65
million
transmission
line
that
cost
us
$13
million
a
year
to
main
own
and
maintain
and
operate.
now,
there’s
no
time
to
open
or
close
switches.
these
emergencies
happened
like
that
if
the
power
isn’t
supply
within
1/20th
of
a
second.
one
1/20th
of
a
second,
you’re
going
to
have
a
brownout
or
blackout.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
no,
we
don’t,
but
in
not
for
this
one
customer
and
this
is
why
we’re
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
not
this
one
customer,
that’s
right.
if
you
give
him
a
free
hour,
transmission
system
can
take
care
of
gainesville
without
any
additional
capacity.
but
what
about
the
next
customer
and
that
we
got
a
lot
of
municipal
systems
in
florida.
we’re
serving
12
at
wholesale.
we’re
serving
nine
rea’s.
suppose
they
all
want
free
standby.
now,
our
customers
we
figure
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
oh,
it
isn’t
that’s
simple,
your
honor.
we
--
if
we
can’t
do
it,
we
have
to
provide
capacity
and
for
anybody
with
whom
we’re
interconnected.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
well,
if
the
federal
power
commission
orders
us
to,
we
do.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
no,
the
statute
does
restrict
them
against
ordering
us
to
do
anything
that
would
require
any
addition
to
our
system.
but
let’s
look
at
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
our
customers.
we
figure
that
this
build
in
to
our
system
of
cost
of
$3.20
a
kilowatt
for
standby
in
our
transmission
line.
every
customer
on
our
system
in
his
rates
has
that
build
in
to
his
rates
as
one
element
of
cost.
now,
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
retail
customers
and
wholesale
customers,
everybody.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
well,
i’m
not
talking
--
i
haven’t
broken
this
down
for
how
much
power
any
one
person
should
use.
this
is
based
on
our
load.
we
have
a
load
of
1,500
megawatts.
we
figure
this
is
what
it
cost
on
a
total
load
basis
and
we
have
to
recover
that
money
somewhere,
we
haven’t
broken
it
down
for
an
individual
customer.
but
take
one
of
the
cities
that
we’re
serving
wholesale.
we
serve
them
power
--
they
buy
power
from
us.
in
their
rate,
is
built-in
the
cost
of
our
transmission
system
and
our
standby
capability
and
they
pay
for
it.
now,
gainesville
wants
it
for
nothing
and
we
think
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
well,
that’s
right
but
that’s
--
we
pay
for
the
power
if
we
buy
it
from
them,
but
what’s
going
to
happen
is
and
you
got
to
understand.
this
interconnection
inevitably
unavoidably
will
result
in
us
protecting
them
at
all
hours
of
the
day
and
night
against
any
outage
on
their
system,
the
testimony.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
no,
we
cannot
operate
our
system
in
a
way
that
i
wouldn’t
protect
them
except
for
opening
the
switch
which
the
federal
power
commission
says
you
can
do.
we
have
to
have
--
mr.
justice
white,
it
really
is
this.
our
system
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
that’s
right.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
it’s
conceivable
in
some
great
crisis
if
we
have
enough
loss
of
generation
we
might
have
to
cut
off
everybody
--
a
lot
of
people
and
that
to
cut
off
some
of
our
own
customers.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
oh,
we
can
cut
off
--
we
can
cut
them
off.
(voice
overlap)
but
in
any
normal
operation
we
have
to
protect
against
loss
of
400
or
500
megawatts.
and
we
have
to
have
that
spinning.
that
has
to
be
an
operation
all
the
time
and
it
has
to
be
available
within
one
1/20th
of
a
second.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
that’s
right.
but
what
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
it
does
not
add
to
our
burden.
we
cannot
deny
that
but
what
we
say,
anybody
and
everybody
who
connects
to
our
transmission
system
ought
to
pay
its
fair
share
of
the
cost.
i
mean
they
shouldn’t
get
a
free
ride.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
well,
the
only
ones
that
i
know
are
florida
power
and
light,
tampa
electric,
orlando
and
jacksonville.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
we
do
not
have
any
similar
standby
arrangement
with
them
because
we
have
what
we
envisage
mutuality
of
service
arrangements.
i
mean
if
we
lose
a
couple
of
hundred
megawatts,
they
can
supply
it
to
us
the
same
way
if
they
lose
a
couple
of
hundred
megawatts
we
can
supply
to
them.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
we’d
say
would
be
a
complete
one-way
street
here
whereas
with
the
others
it’s
a
mutual
street,
it’s
a
two-way
street.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
well,
we
have
those
things
happened
and
so
far
as
i
know,
we’ve
never
--
we’ve
been
able
to
take
care
of
all
them
that
i
know
about.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
your
honor,
gainesville
couldn’t
supply
enough
to
see.
i
mean,
it
wouldn’t
merely
do
us
any
good,
the
most
that
they
can
supply
in
instantaneous
power
if
they
had
everything
running
and
they
admit
that
they
wouldn’t
run
everything,
it
would
be
about
10
megawatts.
and
for
a
system
that
needs
400
or
500,
the
10
we
can’t
see.
now,
furthermore
in
our
planning
and
operation
of
our
system,
we
and
this
is
why
they
mean
nothing
to
us,
we
include
30
or
40
megawatts
as
a
margin
of
error
in
planning
our
system
and
then
the
operation
of
our
system.
we
couldn’t
change
our
method
of
operation
because
of
gainesville,
because
they
can’t
supply
enough
to
provide
any
mutuality
to
this
interconnection
or
any
reciprocity
to
this
interconnection.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
none,
whatsoever
except,
they
have
a
number
of
interconnection
agreements.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
no,
not
there
is
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
have
several.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
yes,
they
just
said
that
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
no,
we
are
asking
for
no
higher
charge
for
power.
we
are
asking
them
to
bear
a
fair
share
of
the
cost
of
our
standby
for
the
amount
of
the
standby
that
they’re
going
to
use.
we
say
that
this
standby
or
our
built-in
excess
capacity
which
is
going
to
protect
both
systems
cost
us
$3.20
per
kilowatt
per
year.
if
you
pay
your
fair
share
of
the
cost
of
that
based
on
the
demands
that
you’re
putting
on
the
excess
capacity
on
our
system
and
the
demands
that
we’re
putting
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
that’s
right.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
because
there’s
no
provision
for
it,
that’s
what
we’re
complaining.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
well,
because
the
other
people
not
only
pay
for
the
power
that
they
get
based
on
complicated,
etcetera.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
you’re
right,
they
pay
a
rate.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
that’s
right.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
no,
it
isn’t
it
does
not
include
any
provisions
for
standby,
that’s
our
whole
point.
it
doesn’t,
it
only
includes
when
they
take
power
they
pay
5
cents
per
kilowatt
plus
a
low
energy
charge.
actually,
they
get
it
cheaper
because
they
get
it
at
our
cost
plus
10%.
they
get
what
we
call
an
interchange
rate.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
plus
10%.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
yes.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
that
will
compensate
us
for
when
they’re
taking
power
across
the
interconnection
but
it
will
not
compensate
us
for
maintaining
this
large
transmission
system.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
that’s
right,
but
we
--
if
they
want
to
use
it
why
shouldn’t
they
pay
for
it?
mr.
richard
w.
emory
well,
your
honor
it’s
the
same
--
it’s
this
situation.
if
you
go
into
an
airline
and
they
have
an
empty
seat,
do
you
contend
that
you
should
take
--
get
a
free
ride?
if
you
go
to
a
hotel
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
that’s
all
we’re
asking
them.
we’re
asking
to
pay
exactly
what
our
customers
pay.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
no.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
that’s
right.
we
say
it’s
more
than
an
option.
we
say
it’s
an
absolute
firm
obligation
that
we
can’t
escape.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
and
it’s
a
firm
obligation
and
once
you
make
that
connection
and
close
the
switch
in
order
the
switch
kept
closed,
we’re
going
to
be
standing
there
with
the
standby.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
we
have
one
that
i
know
of
since
the
case
--
it’s
not
in
the
record
who
is
paying
the
standby.
now,
i
like
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
well,
it’s
like
insurance
make
sense
your
honor,
that’s
right,
but
the
switch
is
closed.
the
power
--
federal
power
commission
ordered
the
switch
kept
closed
and
unless
the
switch
is
kept
closed,
this
arrangement
is
no
good
to
them.
it’s
only
good
to
them
because
the
switch
is
closed
and
if
they
have
any
generating
outage
or
generating
deficiency,
they
will
be
automatically
protected.
if
they
weren’t
going
to
close
the
switch,
they
shouldn’t
pay
for
standby.
i
would
agree
with
that.
but
when
they
close
the
switch
and
keep
the
switch
closed
and
impose
upon
us
the
burden
to
protecting
them,
we
think
they
ought
to
pay
their
fair
share.
now,
if
what
we
ask
isn’t
a
fair
share,
we’re
probably
willing
to
listen
to
what’s
reasonable,
but
the
federal
power
commission
just
if
evaded
this.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
no,
i
don’t
agree
with
that.
we
are
paying
about
$13
million
a
year
for
our
backbone
transmission
network.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
no,
we
would
be
paying
that
anyway.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
we
won’t
increase,
but
we
say
we
should
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
--
subsidize
them.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
we
are
asking
that
we
not
be
required
to
subsidize
them
because
if
we
provide
them
with
free
standby,
and
we
think
that
that’s
exactly
what
we’re
doing.
now,
there
is
a
case
i
like
to
refer
to
that’s
not
in
this
brief.
the
colorado
interstate
gas
company
versus
federal
power
commission,
324
u.s.
581
and
at
page
615,
in
a
concurring
opinion
by
mr.
justice
jackson
and
this
case
involved
gas
rates
--
natural
gas
rates
and
whether
industrial
customers
should
get
a
lower
rate
than
some
municipal
customers
on
the
same
theory
that
they
weren’t
adding
to
the
cost.
in
other
words,
it
wouldn’t
going
to
cost
anymore
to
serve
them,
therefore,
they
should
give
a
cheap
incremental
rate.
and
mr.
justice
jackson
said,
“i
do
not
think
it
can
be
accepted
as
a
principle
of
public
regulation
that
industrial
gas
may
have
a
free
ride
because
the
pipeline
and
compressor
have
to
operate
anyway,
any
more
than
we
can
say
that
a
big
customer
should
have
a
free
ride
for
his
coal
because
the
train
runs
anyway.”
now,
we
feel
that
that
fits
this
case
exactly,
we’re
going
to
provide
standby
that
will
protect
both
of
the
systems.
we
can’t
avoid
it.
it’s
an
inevitable
consequence
of
this
interconnection.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
that’s
right.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
well,
presumably
they
contribute
all
of
it.
what
we’re
talking
about
is
an
averaging.
of
course,
with
--
this
was
a
hundred
we’re
talking
about
charging
them
$154,000.00.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
that’s
all
we’re
talking
about.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
the
maintenance.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
if
you
could
fine
a
$154,000.00
in
our
rate
structure,
our
customers
would
be
entitled
to
$154,000.00
rate
reduction
theoretically.
it
goes
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
that’s
right.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
no,
wait
actually
we
propose
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
no,
we’re
not
complaining
about
that
your
honor,
in
fact
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
no,
actually
that
price
was
recommended
by
us
to
the
commission.
the
commission
took
our
proposal
on
that.
we
are
complaining
that
they
don’t
pay
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
no,
we
complain
that
they
are
not
paying
anything
for
the
free
standby
when
they
are
not
taking
power.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
yes.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
in
this
interchange
arrangement.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
yes.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
that’s
right.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
it’s
not
--
it
is
not
compensatory
if
we’ve
got
to
maintain
the
firehouse,
the
fire
station
24
hours
a
day,
365
days
out
of
the
year
to
protect
their
system
and
our
system.
if
that
was
all
we
were
giving
them
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
well,
your
honor
we’re
--
our
cost
is
not
limited
to
the
cost
of
the
power
that
we
deliver
to
them.
our
cost
is
the
cost
of
maintaining
this
transmission
system.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
well,
we’re
not
complaining
about
the
charge
for
the
power
to
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
we’re
complaining
that
there
was
no
provision
in
here
to
provide
for
standby.
now,
the
commission
has
allowed
the
federal
government’s
standby,
they’ve
allowed
the
southeastern
power
administration
$2.75
a
kilowatt.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
that’s
right.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
that’s
right
and
that’s
as
simple
as
that.
now,
the
chairman
of
the
federal
power
commission
in
testifying
before
congress
in
1967
on
the
--
what
is
known
as
title
iii
of
the
federal
power
act
which
was
never
passed
was
asked
by
senator
monroney
and
this
is
all
about
standby.
senator
monroney:
i
mean
at
the
time,
he
is
not
selling
it.
the
“it”
being
power,
at
the
time
he
is
not
selling
it
does
not
receive
remuneration
for
the
extra
standby
capability
he
has.
mr.
white:
mr.
white
being
the
chairman
of
federal
power
commission.
he
might
be
paid
for
the
capability,
yes.
in
other
words,
in
order
to
protect
the
system,
you
contract
with
your
neighbor
who
says,
“under
these
circumstances,
i
will
provide
you
the
necessary
energy,
if
the
worst
scenario
comes
to
pass,
you
have
to
pay
for
that
right
for
his
commitment
to
you
to
meet
your
needs
when
you
need
help
either
by
making
a
money
payment
or
by
making
the
same
electrical
service
available
to
him.”
so
the
answer
is
yes,
you
are
paid
for
that
and
frankly
it
is
good
business
from
both
points
of
view.
senator
monroney:
in
other
words,
you
are
paid
for
the
standby
capability
even
though
it
is
not
used.
mr.
white,
chairman
of
the
federal
power
commission:
yes.
senator
monroney:
you
would
have
that
for
maybe
two
or
three
years
and
maybe
never
need
the
power,
but
for
only
a
day
or
two.
mr.
white:
that
is
correct.
and
under
the
isolated
system,
they
have
to
have
standby
power
available
unless
they
want
their
customers
to
go
without
service
in
the
event
of
a
disturbance.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
that’s
right.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
no,
me
too.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
no,
because
in
gainesville’s
case,
there’s
nothing
really
that
can
flow
across.
they
can’t
provide
enough
of
this
standby
capacity
to
even
for
us
to
even
take
in
the
consideration.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
in
hundreds.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
if
it
is
a
matter
of
degree
except
to
the
degree
is
so
small
that
it
becomes
meaningless.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
oh,
no.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
well,
i
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
your
honor,
it’s
hard
to
know
because
all
these
agreements
are
pretty
complicated,
they’re
all
negotiated,
they
all
involved
a
lot
of
factors
and
there’s
certain
going
to
be
enough
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
of
instantaneous,
yes
with
orlando
but
we’re
buying
a
hundred
megawatts
from
them
regularly,
i
think.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
well,
that
is
a
firm
purchase
on
their
fit.
i
don’t
think
they
could
provide
it
but
depend
on
what
they
had
operating
and
i
do
have
to
do
some
arithmetic.
they
--
i
don’t
know
whether
they
could
provide
40
or
50
megawatts
of
standby,
i’m
not
sure,
instantaneously.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
no.
but
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
well,
i
say,
it
would
save
our
customers
$154,000.00
a
year
which
would
go
in
to
our
earnings.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
well,
if
you
could
find
a
hundred
and
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
well,
this
probably
wouldn’t
affect
federal
power
rates.
it
would
affect
our
domestic
or
interstate
--
intrastate
rates.
it
would
be
one
fact
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
they’ve
been
dropping
regularly
every
year.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
well,
what
they
say
they
want
is
50
megawatts
such
as
the
size
of
their
largest
unit
and
their
actual
testimony
is
we
need
and
want
emergency
backup
service
in
the
amount
of
our
largest
unit
which
is
50
megawatts.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
we
have
two
or
three.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
i
guess.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
that’s
right.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
that’s
right,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
we
had
two
engineering
witness
made
this
estimate.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
yes.
--
no,
he
was
an
independent
--
well,
he
was
hired
consultant.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
no,
they
just
ignored
it.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
although,
that’s
on
the
power
they
sell
on
the
standby,
they
didn’t.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
well
on
that
they
just
took
our
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
no,
we
have
no
standby
charge
in
that
your
honor.
none.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
$154,000.00
mr.
richard
w.
emory
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
this
honorable
court.
i
think
it’s
important
to
understand
what
standby
is
and
i
don’t
think
that
that
is
really
yet
understood.
mr.
justice
marshall
referred
to
it
as
insurance
and
that
in
the
sense
is
what
it
is.
maybe
a
better
definition
it’s
the
order
in
the
pipes
all
around
the
city
of
washington
where
you
have
fire
hydrants
and
you
got
quite
complicated
system
of
water
pipes
and
fire
hydrants
and
somebody
is
paying
for
those
water
pipes
and
those
fire
hydrants
and
the
order
that’s
in
there
and
that
is
what
florida
power
is
paying
for
and
what
we
say
we’re
not
going
to
get
any
compensation.
we’re
paying
for
the
fire
department,
the
fire
engines,
the
firemen,
the
water
pipes
and
the
water
and
it’s
there
at
all
hours
of
the
day
and
night
and
it’s
constantly
available.
now,
we
feel
one
of
the
reasons
this
has
never
come
up
before.
this
is
the
first
time
the
federal
power
commission
has
ever
come
up
with
this
idea
of
relative
burden,
burden
sharing,
burdens
and
proportion
to
size.
they’ve
never
--
nobody
had
ever,
ever
dreamed
of
such
a
theory.
as
far
as
i
know,
you
can’t
find
it
anywhere
and
any
of
their
decisions
in
the
one
decision
that
they
had
on
the
subject,
they
said
that
charges
across
an
interconnection
should
be
based
on
the
reciprocity
and
mutual
exchange
of
services.
and
the
cases
or
the
rights
that
have
come
up
sense
actually
until
this
came
along
they
really
hadn’t
passed
on
any
rates.
they
hadn’t
had
it
force
interconnection
case
and
what
we
think
makes
this
highly
unfair
and
highly
discriminatory
where
the
federal
government
agencies
southeastern
power
authority
which
is
an
agency
of
the
department
of
interior
has
come
in
with
the
same
kind
of
standby
charge
request,
they’ve
been
allowed.
they
are
getting
$2.75
of
kilowatt
per
year
for
standby.
they
have
a
100
megawatts
of
reserve
and
they
are
selling
it
to
three
people
on
how
really,
a
when
as
and
if
available
basis
and
the
contract
say,
that
anyone
of
the
other
three
are
using
it,
it’s
too
bad
though
you
can’t
get
it
but
this
is
being
paid
for
every
hour
of
the
day
or
night.
now,
when
they
actually
take
power
if
they
should
have
a
breakdown
and
start
taking
power,
they
stop
paying
this
$2.75
and
i
think
they’re
paying
$9.00
or
$10.00
and
a
half.
they
pay
a
higher
rate,
but
in
addition
to
what
they
--
in
addition
to
paying
for
what
they
take,
they
pay
for
the
fire
department,
they
pay
for
the
pipes
that
are
in
the
ground
and
the
water
that’s
at
all
time
is
there.
now,
gainesville
--
something
to
say
about
gainesville
maintaining
this
15%
reserve.
let
me
show
you
how
ridiculous
that
is,
they
had
a
112%
reserve
when
we
tried
this
case
and
they
propose
by
tying
in
to
our
transmission
system
and
relying
on
us
to
reduce
that
reserve
to
15%.
and
what
is
15%?
they
got
100
megawatts
of
demand.
we’re
talking
about
15-megawatt
reserve
and
here
we
need
the
500
instantaneously
and
they’re
going
to
reduce
the
reserve
from
112%
to
15%
and
they
talk
about
that
being
a
burden.
and
to
me,
it
just
doesn’t
make
any
sense
at
all.
now,
the
one
expert
who
heard
all
the
whiteness
and
the
testimony
in
this
case
was
the
trial
examiner
and
he
decided
this
case
right
down
the
line
for
us
100%.
now,
he
decided
that
there
should
definitely
be
some
charge
for
standby
that
it
was
well-recognized
in
the
industry
that
where
you
pay
for
--
where
you
provide
a
service
for
which
you
get
no
return,
there
should
be
some
charge.
and
it
is
also
not
uncommon
in
these
interconnection
arrangements
to
split
the
benefits
--
you
decide
what
the
savings
are
and
one
fellow
it
gets
half
and
the
other
gets
half
and
he
proposed
that
standby
be
paid
for
by
splitting
of
the
financial
savings.
we
don’t
object
to
that,
actually,
we
think
that
would
cost
gainesville
more
than
what
we
propose
to
charge.
although,
it’s
never
been
fully
price
status
but
it’s
a
perfectly
to
be
reasonable
proposal
and
it
is
a
proposal
that’s
used
many
of
these
interconnection
arrangements.
now,
there’s
something
been
said
about
our
customers
having
a
prior
claim
over
gainesville
for
the
standby.
your
honors,
that
is
just
ignores
the
physical
facts
of
how
electricity
operates.
we
cannot
even
subordinate
the
demands
of
our
customer
to
gainesville.
we
got
this
large
transmission
system
if
you
look
at
exhibit
32,
which
is
a
map
of
which,
you’ll
see
that
it’s
a
pretty
large
thing.
and
that
is
a
big
electric
transmission
system
that’s
charged
at
all
hours
to
the
day
and
night
to
feed
any
demands
for
current
off
of
it.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
absolutely,
we
think
we
can
--
it
will
be
just
as
firm
as
it
can
be
and
the
gainesville
witnesses
admitted
that.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
i
deny
the
statement
and
i
deny
what
the
commission
found.
i
think
saying
that
we
will
not
be
under
a
firm
obligation
to
supply
the
standby
just
to
play
on
words.
you
don’t
write
the
word
firm
in
there
that’s
what
they
say.
we
didn’t
put
in
the
word
firm.
you
don’t
need
to
put
in
the
word
firm
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
well,
you
don’t
have
to
put
the
word
firm
in.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
no,
you
just
sign
the
contract,
“i
hereby
agree
to
buy
a
horse.”
you
don’t
see,
“i
hereby
firmly
agree
to
buy
horse.”
and
that’s
what
we’re
talking
about
here.
they
said,
“you
let
gainesville
tack
your
transmission
system.”
mr.
richard
w.
emory
whether
you
want
to
do
it
and
not.
and
the
mere
fact
they
could
puts
us
under
a
firm
obligation
to
supply
them
whether
they
call
it
firm
or
call
it
nothing.
and
it’s
the
same
i
buy
--
i
promise
buy
a
horse
or
i
firmly
promise
to
buy
a
horse.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
well,
that’s
what
we’re
talking
about,
whether
they
use
the
word
or
don’t
use
the
word
that’s
all
into.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
your
honor,
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
i
don’t
think
and
i’m
trying
to
recollect.
i
don’t
think
the
word
“firm”
was
ever
used
in
connection
with
the
standby.
i
think
they
talked
about
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
there
is
no
firm
obligation
to
supply
what
in
the
industry
has
called
firm
power
--
firm
service.
i
agree
to
buy
100
kilowatts
from
you
for
the
next
three
months.
that
is
called
“firm
power.”
there
is
no
obligation
in
this
agreement
to
have
a
selling
“firm
power”
and
there’s
one
reason
and
only
one
reason.
if
they
ever
put
that
in
their
order,
that
would
require
us
to
enlarge
our
generating
facilities
or
would
give
us
an
argument
that
it
will
require
us
to
(voice
overlap).
mr.
richard
w.
emory
then
we
would
be
entitled
to
say
that
they
didn’t
have
any
jurisdiction
because
they
don’t
have
jurisdiction
to
do
anything
that
would
definitely
positively
require
us
to
enlarge
our
facilities.
now,
this
word
“firm”
in
connection
with
standby,
i’m
not
sure
that
the
commission
ever
used
the
word
or
didn’t
use
the
word
because
actually
as
i
say,
you
don’t
need
to
use
the
word.
it’s
a
meaningless
word.
we
are
firmly
bound
where
they
say
so
are
not.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
well,
your
honor
we
can
envisage,
we
sincerely
honestly
cannot
envisage.
they’re
making
a
demand
that
we
won’t
supply
and
the
commission
noticed
that
and
gainesville
knows
that.
how
could
they
reduce
their
reserve
from
112%
of
15%
down
to
15
megawatts
if
they
didn’t
feel
that
they’re
generating
capability
was
going
to
be
firmly
protected?
they
would
be
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
but
they’re
planning
to
eliminate
the
supply
for
themselves.
they’re
going
to
rely
on
us
to
supply
and
the
commission
would
be
derelict
in
their
duty
if
they
said,
gainesville
can
reduce
its
reserve
by
about
a
100%
if
they
didn’t
feel
that
florida
power
was
going
to
be
supply
that
and
they
know
we’re
going
to
supply
it.
and
in
the
case
of
the
southeastern
power
administration
and
the
southwestern
power
administration
and
other
agencies
they
recognize
that.
now,
one
of
the
real
reasons,
i
think
maybe
this
case
was
argued
separately,
i
don’t
know
was
the
government
took
quite
of
different
position
in
their
brief
in
what
gainesville
did.
gainesville
said
the
question
in
this
case
was
whether
they
should
be
made
to
pay
for
benefits
received
in
addition
to
reimbursing
us
for
cost.
well,
we
say
they
aren’t
reimbursing
us
for
cost
much
less
paying
us
for
benefits
received.
the
government
took
the
position
that
their
relative
burdens,
they
either
that
gainesville
supported
us
in
proportion
to
its
size
that
should
be
enough.
and
we
say
proportion
to
size
in
this
case
is
meaningless.
they
also
argued
in
their
brief
and
mr.
gooch
made
a
remarkable
statement
in
his
argument
that
the
federal
power
commission
doesn’t
have
to
pay
any
attention
to
commission
practice.
i
mean
industry
practice,
but
in
their
brief,
they
acknowledged
that
the
vast
majority
of
interconnection
between
utilities
are
effective
voluntarily.
in
contest
to
interconnection
cases
therefore
and
this
is
the
first
contested
interconnection
case
that’s
ever
got
--
hasn’t
been
settled.
there
have
been
about
two
or
three
others,
but
they
have
been
always
been
settled.
it
is
appropriate
that
commission
just
issues
for
establishing
compensation
terms
take
into
account
the
terms
of
current
interconnection
agreements
arranged
at
arm’s-length.
in
other
words,
what
they
said
was,
we
don’t
have
any
expertise,
we’ve
never
been
faced
with
this
problem
before.
therefore,
we
will
look
and
see
what
the
industry
has
been
doing
and
every
time
you
have
given
them
an
example
of
what
the
industry
is
doing,
they
said,
“that’s
not
applicable,
that’s
not
the
same
case.”
none
of
these
cases
are
the
same.
none
of
them
are
identical
almost
every
interconnection
arrangement
is
different.
now,
mr.
spiegel
in
his
reply
brief
referred
to
interconnection
we
have
at
tallahassee
which
was
put
in
after
this
case
so
it’s
not
in
the
record.
he
says,
“we’re
not
charging
them
for
standby.
we
are
not
charging
them
for
standby
for
two
reasons
and
there
may
be
others.”
one
is
the
interconnection
is
too
small
for
us
to
supply
them
standby.
and
the
second
reason,
they
have
built
some
transmission
for
us
so
we’re
getting
some
transmission
from
them.
all
of
these
things
had
been
done
in
arm’s-length.
they’re
all
based
on
an
evaluation
of
what
the
various
equities
are
and
if
there’s
mutuality
or
any
relative
or
reasonable
mutuality
and
what
each
party
is
doing
for
the
other,
you
don’t
have
a
special
charge.
but
if
one
fellow
is
doing
nothing,
but
getting
a
free
ride,
it’s
standard
to
have
him
pay
some
reasonable
compensation
and
if
you
don’t
do
that
and
the
government
argues
you’re
going
to
des
--
you
don’t
follow
their
position,
you’re
going
to
destroy
the
incentive
for
interconnections.
we
say
if
you
don’t
provide
some
mutuality
or
reimbursement
or
compensation
that
will
destroy
the
incentive.
what
incentive
that
we
got
to
interconnect
with
gainesville
or
any
number
of
other
municipalities?
do
you
think
i’m
just
take
a
free
ride
off
of
our
backs.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
that’s
what
i
told
you,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
this
is
something
that
i
didn’t
know
a
thing
about
until
i
got
this
brief
on
monday
and
i
really
don’t
know
much
about
it.
i
asked
the
company
--
the
terms
of
that
and
it’s
a
small
connection.
i
guess
we’re
supplying
them
power
or
they
are
selling
us
power,
i
really
don’t
know.
we’re
selling
i’m
told
that
we’re
selling
them
some
firm
capacity
in
other
words,
they
are
buying
10
megawatts,
20
megawatts
whatever
it
is
and
for
standby
they
need
50
or
60
megawatts.
they’re
buying
some
power
from
us
if
they
could
--
mr.
richard
w.
emory
that’s
municipally-owned.
the
municipal
ownership
has
no
problem
here.
we
were
interconnected
with
orlando
have
been
for
years.
we’re
interconnected
with
--
through
florida
power
and
light
with
jacksonville
which
is
a
municipal
system.
those
municipal
systems
are
member
of
our
operating
group.
but
are
there
paying
anyway?
we’re
not
objecting
to
the
fact
that
this
is
a
municipal,
that
doesn’t
bother
us.
we
say
that
we
shouldn’t
do
it
for
nothing.
now,
as
they
say
the
industry
practice
is
definitely
and
positively
to
arrange
for
some
mutuality
and
if
there’s
not
mutuality
to
have
an
exchange
of
compensation.
now,
i’ll
read
one
more
thing
out
of
the
brief.
the
report
to
the
president
of
the
federal
power
commission
on
the
prevention
of
power
failures
and
it
recited
this
matter
of
the
problem
of
interconnections
and
the
necessity
for
interconnections
to
provide
reliability
of
service
particularly
the
small
systems.
and
after
pointing
out
the
importance
to
small
systems,
it
said
that
the
same
time
the
users
must
contribute
their
proper
share
of
the
cost.
it’s
the
federal
power
commission
talking
before
they
decided
this
case
and
going
on
they
talked
about
factors
that
should
be
taken
into
account
“this
is
the
federal
power
commission
reporting
to
the
president
to
the
extent
that
it
may
be
physically
impossible
for
small
system
to
fulfill
all
such
obligations
in
kind,
equalization
should
take
the
form
of
exchanging
power
or
dollars
among
systems.
no
formula
have
been
accepted
as
universal
applicable
to
these
situations.
a
wide
range
of
pertinent
factors
are
being
considered
such
as
relative
benefits,
methods
or
participation,
reliability
of
service,
conservation
of
natural
resources,
alternative
opportunities
and
broad
equities.”
now,
that
is
really
all
we’re
asking
to
do
to
put
their
pocketbook
so
to
speak
where
they
must
is
and
do
what
they
say
they’re
going
to
do
and
what
they
have
allowed
federal
agencies
to
do
and
the
be
fair
to
our
system
and
to
our
customers
who,
if
gainesville
gets
a
free
ride,
are
going
to
bear
the
whole
cost.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
they
might
be
called
upon
to
give
us
help
over
time
and
that’s
important
and
i’m
glad
you
asked
that
question.
any
help
that
you
give
overtime
no
matter
what
amount
of
time
if
it
is
instantaneous
is
no
trade
for
the
help
that
you
need
instantaneously
because
every
system
has
generation
that
they
can
start
up
and
give
you
overtime
if
you
had
time
to
react.
mr.
richard
w.
emory
well,
actually
they
would
take
two
hours
notice
on
most
of
their
equipment.
that’s
just
not
the
equivalent
if
we
got
two
hours
notice,
we
can
start
up
our
own
generators.
we
got
a
lot
of
generators
that
aren’t
operating
all
the
time
if
we
have
--
maybe
if
we
have
10
minutes,
we
can
start
up
or
two
hours.
now
we
--
they
as
far
as
overtime
is
concerned
until
they
get
down
to
this
reserve
if
they
reduce
their
reserve
down
to
15%,
anything
they
can
give
us
overtime
is
not
worth
anything.
but
as
long
as
they
have
this
100%
reserve,
or
they
could
give
us
maybe
50
or
60
megawatts
overtime
and
divide
that
testimony
over
two
hours.
but
by
the
time
two
hours
had
expired,
they
got
little
unit,
your
honor,
that
a
5
megawatts,
one
of
them
is
1megawatt,
14
megawatts,
we
may
have
125-megawatt
unit
sitting
around
at
overtime,
we
can
start
up
and
not
need
florida
power
and
light,
orlando,
all
the
other
systems,
they’re
interconnected
with
overtime.
and
i
would
like
to
say
one
more
thing
and
that
is
about,
this
business
of
their
--
the
testimony
mr.
gooch
was
asked
about
the
testimony
of
florida
power
relying
on
this
interconnection
whether
it
was
disputed.
they
put
a
man
on
the
stand
and
made
some
computer
studies
and
he
took
the
florida
power
system
and
he
treated
as
independent
system
with
no
interconnections
with
anybody
and
he
found
that
we
wouldn’t
have
enough
power
to
meet
our
peak
load
or
something
like
25
days
out
of
the
year.
this
is
all
in
the
briefs,
then
he
said,
he
got
another
study
it
may
help
you
time
in
with
gainesville,
they
will
only
--
they
won’t
be
able
to
meet
their
peak
load
19
times
of
the
year.
so
therefore,
they’re
going
to
rely
very
heavily
on
this
interconnection.
he
assumed
and
we
had
no
connections
that
we
couldn’t
call
on
florida
power
and
light,
we
couldn’t
call
on
the
tampa,
we
couldn’t
call
on
orlando,
couldn’t
call
on
jacksonville.
actually,
we
don’t
have
these
deficiencies,
we
can
meet
our
peak
load
unless
we
have
big
outages
everyday
in
the
year
and
this
really,
it’s
such
a
theoretical
study,
it’s
almost
absurd
and
the
examiner
really
cut
off
my
if
you
look
at
the
record
and
it’s
in
their,
he
really
cut
off
my
cross-examination
on
that.
he
said,
it’s
the
first
time
i
have
heard
enough
about
that
because
he
saw
how
ridiculous
it
was.
thank
you,
your
honor.
