mr.
gordon
gooch
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
of
course
is
the
same
case
as
464.
the
federal
power
commission
is
appealing
the
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit
which
circumscribed
the
discretion
committed
to
the
commission
in
rate
making
in
connection
with
interconnections
under
the
federal
power
act.
the
federal
power
commission
is
charged
by
congress
with
the
responsibility
of
seeing
to
it
that
all
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
have
reliable
and
adequate
supply
of
power
of
this
country
and
with
due
deference
to
the
environment.
in
this
particular
case,
the
commission
was
called
upon
by
the
city
of
gainesville,
a
municipal
owned
but
the
entirely
self-sufficient
generating
system
to
hold
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
or
not
an
interconnection
should
be
ordered
with
a
larger
investor-owned
utility
the
federal
power
--
florida
power
corporation
and
if
so
at
what
rate.
after
extensive
hearings
before
the
commission
that
were
held
not
only
in
washington,
but
in
florida,
the
commission
considered
the
type
of
evidence
that
mr.
emory
has
recited
here.
he
considered
the
type
of
evidence
that
mr.
spiegel
has
recited
here.
and
in
addition,
had
the
staff
case
placed
in
the
record
by
those
in
the
bureau
of
power
at
the
federal
power
commission
who
are
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
looking
over
these
problems
nationwide.
after
the
examiner’s
decision,
the
commission
considered
the
case
on
its
merits
and
concluded
the
following.
they
concluded
first
that
an
interconnection
was
in
the
public
interest
that
it
placed
no
undue
burden
at
all
on
the
florida
power
of
the
system
in
florida
was
connected
with,
that
it
would
not
require
florida
power
to
increase
any
facilities.
the
commission
determined
that
the
service
to
florida
power’s
customers
would
not
be
impaired
at
all.
the
commission
assigned
100%
of
the
cost
of
the
interconnection
to
the
city
of
gainesville
and
the
commission
set
the
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
and
assigned
a
rate
to
be
charged
for
the
actual
energy
transfers
across
the
interconnection.
now,
what
the
commission
did
in
its
order
was
to
place
gainesville
in
the
same
position
that
it
would
have
been
in
if
the
five
other
utilities
in
the
florida
operating
group
had
admitted
it
to
its
informal
membership.
with
one
significant
exception,
the
commission
imposed
on
the
city
of
gainesville
as
a
condition
for
the
interconnection
that
it
maintain
an
installed
reserve
capacity,
something
that
none
of
the
other
members
of
the
florida
operating
committee
are
required
to
do.
now,
much
argument
is
made
here
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
the
installed
reserve
capacity.
it
is
required
to
maintain
a
115%
of
its
peak
in
installed
generating
capacity.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
sir,
the
record
that
it
is
closed
in
1965
had
projections
all
the
way
through
1979
and
in
the
projections
that
showed
by
the
staff
witnesses
the
projected
additional
generation
that
would
be
required.
the
federal
power
commission
now
made
it
possible
for
gainesville
to
purchase
that
power
rather
than
install
it
if
there
was
an
economic
benefit
to
do
so.
now,
as
through
the
year
roughly
1970
though,
based
on
the
projections
of
1965
with
the
addition
of
the
two
15
megawatt
gas
turbines,
florida
--
the
city
of
gainesville
would
have
adequate
installed
capacity
to
meet
the
115%
obligation
imposed
on
them
by
the
federal
power
commission.
but
as
their
load
grows,
they
have
the
burden
of
maintaining
the
installed
reserve.
now
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
well,
as
of
the
projection
in
the
record,
the
city
of
gainesville
at
the
present
time
would
have
138
megawatts
of
installed.
they
have
anticipated
the
peak
of
about
102
in
the
year
1970
according
to
the
record
that
was
back
in
1965
with
the
projections.
now,
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
sir,
it
went
on
from
1965
they
didn’t
clear
the
commission
to
the
final
opinion
on
rehearing
was
on
january
of
1969.
mr.
gordon
gooch
i’ve
seen
the
condensed
that’s
about
13
in
transcript
form,
sir.
and
we
have
three
witnesses
from
the
city
of
gainesville
of
my
recollection
including
the
witness
from
the
clay
county
cooperative.
we
had
witnesses
from
florida
power.
we
had
three
staff
witnesses
all
subject
to
cross-examination
before
the
examiner.
now,
the
main
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
i
cannot
for
the
life
of
me
see
how
anyone
can
read
the
order
of
the
federal
power
commission
as
requiring
firm
service
to
be
rendered
by
florida
power
to
the
city
of
gainesville.
i
cannot
see
in
any
way
how
that
order
could
be
so
construed.
the
order
is
set
and
clearly
says
that
it
is
non-firm
power.
the
order
clearly
says
that
the
emergency
service
is
subject
to
the
control
of
the
dispatchers
and
the
order
clearly
says
that
the
operation
of
the
interconnection
will
be
left
to
a
committee
which
the
commission
ordered
between
the
city
of
gainesville
and
florida
power
corporation.
mr.
gordon
gooch
i
am
saying
sir
that
the
florida
power
corporation
is
not
required
by
the
order
of
the
federal
power
commission
to
maintain
50
megawatts
or
60
megawatts
of
capability
at
the
archer
substation
at
all
times
and
under
all
circumstances
for
the
benefit
of
the
city
of
gainesville.
they
are
only
ordered
to
make
that
power
available
if
ask
and
when
it
is
available
to
the
florida
power
and
its
interconnected
system.
mr.
gordon
gooch
that’s
right
sir.
second
point
i
would
like
to
make
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
that’s
right
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
i
am
saying
sir
that
the
matter
can
be
handled
in
one
of
several
ways.
one,
that
the
florida
power
has
the
right
to
open
the
switch.
i
am
saying
also
that
florida
power
has
the
right
to
tell
the
city
of
gainesville
to
shed
load.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes
sir.
well,
let
me
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
let
me
answer
in
this
way
sir.
if
it
is
a
firm
customer
of
florida
power,
in
other
words,
if
it
is
a
question
of
impairing
the
ability
of
florida
power
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
city
of
orlando.
like
the
city
of
orlando
which
is
comparable
in
size
to
the
city
of
gainesville.
if
it’s
as
and
when
available
to
both
systems
and
i
would
assume
that
if
that
the
dispatchers
them
would
have
to
get
together
and
decide
who’s
going
to
shed
load,
how
they’re
going
to
lay
it
off
among
themselves.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
no
sir,
the
purpose
of
the
committee
is
to
setup
the
operating
procedures
as
to
how
the
interconnection
will
be
setup,
what
sort
of
relays
will
be
put
in
there,
what
sort
of
--
how
the
system
will
be
operated.
it
is
true.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
that
depends
on
first
whether
it
is
available
on
the
florida
power
corporation
system,
point
one.
point
two,
it
has
to
be
scheduled
and
if
the--
mr.
gordon
gooch
well,
you
don’t
schedule
the
sudden
breakdown.
the
point
is
that
it
is
true
that
power
will
flow.
frankly,
it
will
flow
mostly
from
gainesville
to
florida
power
according
to
the
staff
case,
but
it
is
true
that
instantaneously
as
if
a
load
goes
down
on
one
or
other
side
of
the
interconnection
power
will
flow.
but
that
doesn’t
mean
that
it
will
flow
forever.
it
can
be
shut
off
almost
immediately
if
the
power
is
needed
somewhere
else.
mr.
gordon
gooch
i
say
that
the
firm
customers
do
have
a
prior
claim
on
the
power.
yes,
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
but
not
the
pool
because
as
the
commission
evidence
showed
in
fact
by
installing
gainesville
into
the
pool
under
the
terms,
what
the
commission
was
really
trying
to
do
was
to
fit
gainesville
and
as
a
full-fledged
member
of
the
pool
without
being
having
to
pay
twice
dues
because
they
were
late
in
joining.
and
the
--
instead
of
getting
any
credit
for
having
done
that,
we’re
blamed
because
we
didn’t
follow
what
someone
else
says
the
industry
practices.
well,
of
course
the
commission
is
under
no
obligation
to
follow
with
the
industry
perhaps
says.
mr.
gordon
gooch
if
we
take
the
instances
at
which
were
not
in
the
record
but
mentioned
in
briefs
of
florida
power,
i
cause
those
specific
instances
to
be
check
by
the
section
of
the
federal
power
commission
who
reviews
those
things.
and
they
informed
me
that
if
we
were
to
resolve
that
kind
of
dispute
at
this
hearing
that
they
would
testify
that
none
of
the
contract
cited
by
florida
power
corporation
can
attain
the
kind
of
standby
charged
at
florida.
mr.
gordon
gooch
well,
sir
on
page
26
of
their
brief,
they
refer
to
a
12-megawatt
sale
which
is
i
believe
the
one
that
mr.
emory
was
referring
to.
that
was
in
our
view
an
entirely
different
situation
because
the
line
was
placed
in
for
the
benefit
of
florida
power’s
customers.
now,
subsequent
to
the
time
that
the
evidence
was
in
in
this
case,
subsequent
to
that
time,
the
florida
power
corporation
came
in
and
said,
that
they
have
negotiated,
they
deal
with
another
company
which
they
had
imposed
some
sort
of
standby
charge.
mr.
gordon
gooch
well,
yes.
mr.
gordon
gooch
that
was
my
understanding,
but
the
point
that
causes
the
problem
is
that
the
only
reason
to
bring
up
that
kind
of
point
is
to
claim
that
the
federal
power
commission
gave
gainesville
better
membership
conditions
in
the
pool
and
others
have.
now,
we
say
that’s
not
sole
and
the
all
the
evidence
shows
that
gainesville
has
the
same
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
and
the
second,
i’m
just
getting
to
ready
to
bring
up,
and
that
is
that
the
commission
specifically
provided
in
its
order
that
florida
power
corporation
may
file
for
a
rate
increase
under
the
commission’s
regulations
if
they’re
not
getting
what
they
think
they’re
entitled
to
under
the
service
of
the
interconnection.
mr.
gordon
gooch
precisely,
and
the
commission
--
the
expert
evidence
on
which
the
commission
rely
showed
that
the
city
of
gainesville
would
be
providing
proportionately
more
service
to
florida
power
than
otherwise.
now,
i’d
like
to
touch
on
that
point
for
a
second
if
i
may.
50
to
60
megawatts,
florida
power
admits
that
they
can
give
50
or
60
megawatts
without
even
filling
at
their
system.
they
got
a
swing
of
30
to
40
megawatts
that
they
say
that
it
means
nothing
to
them.
but
i
say
that
50
megawatts
going
back
across
the
interconnection
from
gainesville
to
florida
power
can’t
be
too
insignificant
if
florida
power
is
buying
firm
from
tiny
orlando
at
100
megawatts.
if
the
interconnection
--
the
valid
interconnection
between
the
florida
power
system
and
its
neighbors
to
the
north
and
georgia
will
open
at
130
megawatts,
if
florida
power
will
negotiate
a
12-megawatt
transaction
and
then
cited
in
their
brief
as
an
example.
and
if
as
the
minutes
of
the
florida
operating
committee
show
the
florida
operating
committee
does
not
even
maintain
at
all
times
adequate
spending
reserves
under
their
own
standards.
and
if
as
in
this
record,
the
city
of
gainesville
and
florida
power
corporation
are
arguing
over
service
to
individual
customers
in
alachua
county.
it
seems
to
me
that
we
cannot
argue
that
50
megawatts
is
insignificant
to
florida
power
corporation.
now,
the
commission
has
to
resolve
these
kind
of
disputes
all
the
time
and
then
have
to
resolve
the
disputes
not
only
because
it
is
a
dispute
between
parties,
but
because
they
have
an
affirmative
obligation
to
develop
a
policy
that
will
work
nationwide.
and
the
staff
tries
to
do
its
best
to
put
on
a
case
that
will
be
assistance
to
the
commission.
the
commission
doesn’t
of
course
always
take
the
best
part
of
anybody’s
case,
but
they
resolve
the
disputes
in
this
case.
they
set
the
rates
and
they
ordered
the
interconnection
and
we
believe
the
fifth
circuit
was
an
error
in
saying
if
the
commission
may
not
set
the
rate
on
the
basis
that
they
did.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
well,
it
is
disputed
in
the
sense
that
i
don’t
--
it’s
difficult
to
say.
yes,
it
was
disputed,
there
were
witnesses
that
said
that’s
just
a
mathematical
probability
and
the
mere
fact
that
it’s
mathematical
probability
it
doesn’t
mean
that
it
actually
will
happen.
there
were
plenty
of
arguments
to
the
way
that
addressed
to
the
commission,
but
i
do
not
recall
any
competing
exhibits
that
showed
different.
mr.
gordon
gooch
commission
found
that
it
was
likely
that
florida
power
would
be
drawing
on
the
interconnection
more
than
the
city
of
gainesville
would,
and
the
commission
then
by
imposing
the
same
standards
of
responsibility
on
gainesville
as
were
imposed
on
florida
power
by
the
operating
agreement.
the
commission
thought
there
was
an
equality
here
and
since
the
gainesville
can
at
some
periods
deliver
the
full
50
to
60
megawatts
and
not
all
the
time
across
the
interconnection.
mr.
gordon
gooch
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
that
particular
finding
was
not
entitled
to
weigh
under
the
substantial
evidence
rule.
the
commission
--
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
benefits
that
the
federal
power
commission
found
for
florida
power
system
were
vague
and
insubstantial.
and
the
court
said
that
because
of
the
firm
obligation
that
was
being
imposed
on
florida
power
by
the
commission’s
order,
that
a
standby
charge
was
an
order
and
the
commission
would
have
to
come
up
under
some
theory
to
do
this.
mr.
gordon
gooch
that’s
right.
the
commission
ordered
no
firm.
mr.
gordon
gooch
absolutely,
ordered
no
firm
and
if
there
was
any
doubt
that
the
commission
ordered
firm,
you
would
have
thought
that
florida
power
and
their
motion
for
rehearing
before
the
commission
would’ve
pointed
out
at
inconsistency
in
the
order
between
saying.
this
is
a
non-firm
order
as
to
the
interconnection
and
the
facilities
that
were
actually
being
ordered
in,
but
nothing
appears
in
their
rehearing.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
no,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
gooch
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
southeastern
power
administration
that
is
a
firm
100-megawatt
reserve
that’s
got
to
be
available
to
those
three
customers
at
all
times.
they
install
reserve
point,
florida
power
corporation
is
under
no
obligation
under
the
florida
operating
committee
rules
to
maintain
any
installed
reserves
and
i
strongly
suspect
that
15%
of
installed
reserves
would
look
awfully
good
to
the
florida
power
system
come
this
summer
on
turkey
point
didn’t
come
here.
next
point,
the
commission
imposed
on
the
city
of
gainesville
and
installed
reserve
capacity
that
would
see
to
it
that
it
would
always
be
self-sufficient.
the
only
thing
that
the
commission
provided
was
that
when
florida
power
can
help
its
little
neighbor
out,
it
should
do
so.
mr.
gordon
gooch
when
florida
power
had
the
ability
to
do
so.
now,
what
does
this
do
to
the
rate
payer
in
the
city
of
gainesville?
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
now,
the
reserve
that
gainesville
is
required
to
maintain
under
the
operating
committee
formula
is
one
thing.
what
it
has
the
capability
to
put
across
that
interconnection
is
another.
mr.
emory
would
have
you
to
believe
that
gainesville
system
is
so
adequate
and
so
small
that
it
has
response
and
only
two
outages
or
more.
i
point
out
as
in
the
brief,
they
have
the
two
15-megawatt
gas
turbines,
they
have
50-megawatt
generator
and
number
seven
unit
and
26-megawatt.
their
testimony
is
they
would
always
be
running
those
too.
the
seven,
number
seven
and
number
eight
and
have
the
other
two
available.
so
i
suggest
that
it
is
somewhat
unfair
to
the
city
of
gainesville
to
say
that
they
cannot
respond
with
emergency
power
across
that
interconnection.
now,
as
to
the
relative
benefits,
again,
by
imposing
on
the
city
of
gainesville
a
demand
charge
--
a
standby
charge
based
on
the
size
of
their
largest
unit,
what
that
effectively
does
through
rate
treatment
is
to
prevent
the
city
of
gainesville
from
increasing
the
size
of
its
larger
generators.
thereby,
increasing
the
amount
of
rate
that
the
citizens
in
gainesville
will
have
to
pay
if
t
they’re
going
to
be
an
isolated
system.
it
would
mean
that
they
would
have
to
buy
an
increments
of
small
or
less
sufficient
generators
so
they
could
always
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
if
there
is
--
well,
if
they
were
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
no,
sir.
oh,
as
the
alternative?
yes,
sir.
they
would
be
faced
with
the
economic
choice
of
not
completing
the
interconnection
and
building
their
own
generation.
and
the
federal
power
commission
has
recognized
just
like
florida
power
recognizes
that
that
it’s
uneconomic
and
wasteful
to
carry
more
--
install
a
capacity
then
you’re
going
to
need
for
a
reasonable
period
of
time.
and
so
rather
than
deprecate
the
city
of
gainesville
for
being
able
to
reduce
their
installed
capacity,
this
is
one
of
the
purposes,
one
of
the
benefits
of
interconnection.
and
florida
power
cannot
maintain
its
own
and
does
not
maintain
its
own
installed
reserves
by
itself
to
take
care
of
itself
in
the
event
of
major
outages
on
its
system.
so
it
is
easy
to,
i
suppose
deprecate
to
the
contribution
that
gainesville
can
make,
but
then
we
should
also
deprecate
the
contribution
that
orlando
makes
which
is
not
that
much
bigger
than
gainesville
which
includes
100-megawatt
firm
sale.
on
value
of
service,
it
seems
to
me
unnecessary
to
say
that
a
regulatory
commission
is
not
bound
to
take
into
consideration
the
value
of
service.
the
value
of
electricity
to
a
man
in
an
iron
long
is
a
lot
more
than
valuable
electricity
to
someone
making
coffee
in
the
morning,
but
that
has
not
been
and
has
not
in
this
case
the
basis
on
which
the
commission
sets
rates
for
utility.
mr.
gordon
gooch
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
of
course
is
the
same
case
as
464.
the
federal
power
commission
is
appealing
the
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit
which
circumscribed
the
discretion
committed
to
the
commission
in
rate
making
in
connection
with
interconnections
under
the
federal
power
act.
the
federal
power
commission
is
charged
by
congress
with
the
responsibility
of
seeing
to
it
that
all
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
have
reliable
and
adequate
supply
of
power
of
this
country
and
with
due
deference
to
the
environment.
in
this
particular
case,
the
commission
was
called
upon
by
the
city
of
gainesville,
a
municipal
owned
but
the
entirely
self-sufficient
generating
system
to
hold
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
or
not
an
interconnection
should
be
ordered
with
a
larger
investor-owned
utility
the
federal
power
--
florida
power
corporation
and
if
so
at
what
rate.
after
extensive
hearings
before
the
commission
that
were
held
not
only
in
washington,
but
in
florida,
the
commission
considered
the
type
of
evidence
that
mr.
emory
has
recited
here.
he
considered
the
type
of
evidence
that
mr.
spiegel
has
recited
here.
and
in
addition,
had
the
staff
case
placed
in
the
record
by
those
in
the
bureau
of
power
at
the
federal
power
commission
who
are
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
looking
over
these
problems
nationwide.
after
the
examiner’s
decision,
the
commission
considered
the
case
on
its
merits
and
concluded
the
following.
they
concluded
first
that
an
interconnection
was
in
the
public
interest
that
it
placed
no
undue
burden
at
all
on
the
florida
power
of
the
system
in
florida
was
connected
with,
that
it
would
not
require
florida
power
to
increase
any
facilities.
the
commission
determined
that
the
service
to
florida
power’s
customers
would
not
be
impaired
at
all.
the
commission
assigned
100%
of
the
cost
of
the
interconnection
to
the
city
of
gainesville
and
the
commission
set
the
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
and
assigned
a
rate
to
be
charged
for
the
actual
energy
transfers
across
the
interconnection.
now,
what
the
commission
did
in
its
order
was
to
place
gainesville
in
the
same
position
that
it
would
have
been
in
if
the
five
other
utilities
in
the
florida
operating
group
had
admitted
it
to
its
informal
membership.
with
one
significant
exception,
the
commission
imposed
on
the
city
of
gainesville
as
a
condition
for
the
interconnection
that
it
maintain
an
installed
reserve
capacity,
something
that
none
of
the
other
members
of
the
florida
operating
committee
are
required
to
do.
now,
much
argument
is
made
here
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
the
installed
reserve
capacity.
it
is
required
to
maintain
a
115%
of
its
peak
in
installed
generating
capacity.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
sir,
the
record
that
it
is
closed
in
1965
had
projections
all
the
way
through
1979
and
in
the
projections
that
showed
by
the
staff
witnesses
the
projected
additional
generation
that
would
be
required.
the
federal
power
commission
now
made
it
possible
for
gainesville
to
purchase
that
power
rather
than
install
it
if
there
was
an
economic
benefit
to
do
so.
now,
as
through
the
year
roughly
1970
though,
based
on
the
projections
of
1965
with
the
addition
of
the
two
15
megawatt
gas
turbines,
florida
--
the
city
of
gainesville
would
have
adequate
installed
capacity
to
meet
the
115%
obligation
imposed
on
them
by
the
federal
power
commission.
but
as
their
load
grows,
they
have
the
burden
of
maintaining
the
installed
reserve.
now
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
well,
as
of
the
projection
in
the
record,
the
city
of
gainesville
at
the
present
time
would
have
138
megawatts
of
installed.
they
have
anticipated
the
peak
of
about
102
in
the
year
1970
according
to
the
record
that
was
back
in
1965
with
the
projections.
now,
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
sir,
it
went
on
from
1965
they
didn’t
clear
the
commission
to
the
final
opinion
on
rehearing
was
on
january
of
1969.
mr.
gordon
gooch
i’ve
seen
the
condensed
that’s
about
13
in
transcript
form,
sir.
and
we
have
three
witnesses
from
the
city
of
gainesville
of
my
recollection
including
the
witness
from
the
clay
county
cooperative.
we
had
witnesses
from
florida
power.
we
had
three
staff
witnesses
all
subject
to
cross-examination
before
the
examiner.
now,
the
main
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
i
cannot
for
the
life
of
me
see
how
anyone
can
read
the
order
of
the
federal
power
commission
as
requiring
firm
service
to
be
rendered
by
florida
power
to
the
city
of
gainesville.
i
cannot
see
in
any
way
how
that
order
could
be
so
construed.
the
order
is
set
and
clearly
says
that
it
is
non-firm
power.
the
order
clearly
says
that
the
emergency
service
is
subject
to
the
control
of
the
dispatchers
and
the
order
clearly
says
that
the
operation
of
the
interconnection
will
be
left
to
a
committee
which
the
commission
ordered
between
the
city
of
gainesville
and
florida
power
corporation.
mr.
gordon
gooch
i
am
saying
sir
that
the
florida
power
corporation
is
not
required
by
the
order
of
the
federal
power
commission
to
maintain
50
megawatts
or
60
megawatts
of
capability
at
the
archer
substation
at
all
times
and
under
all
circumstances
for
the
benefit
of
the
city
of
gainesville.
they
are
only
ordered
to
make
that
power
available
if
ask
and
when
it
is
available
to
the
florida
power
and
its
interconnected
system.
mr.
gordon
gooch
that’s
right
sir.
second
point
i
would
like
to
make
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
that’s
right
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
i
am
saying
sir
that
the
matter
can
be
handled
in
one
of
several
ways.
one,
that
the
florida
power
has
the
right
to
open
the
switch.
i
am
saying
also
that
florida
power
has
the
right
to
tell
the
city
of
gainesville
to
shed
load.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes
sir.
well,
let
me
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
let
me
answer
in
this
way
sir.
if
it
is
a
firm
customer
of
florida
power,
in
other
words,
if
it
is
a
question
of
impairing
the
ability
of
florida
power
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
city
of
orlando.
like
the
city
of
orlando
which
is
comparable
in
size
to
the
city
of
gainesville.
if
it’s
as
and
when
available
to
both
systems
and
i
would
assume
that
if
that
the
dispatchers
them
would
have
to
get
together
and
decide
who’s
going
to
shed
load,
how
they’re
going
to
lay
it
off
among
themselves.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
no
sir,
the
purpose
of
the
committee
is
to
setup
the
operating
procedures
as
to
how
the
interconnection
will
be
setup,
what
sort
of
relays
will
be
put
in
there,
what
sort
of
--
how
the
system
will
be
operated.
it
is
true.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
that
depends
on
first
whether
it
is
available
on
the
florida
power
corporation
system,
point
one.
point
two,
it
has
to
be
scheduled
and
if
the--
mr.
gordon
gooch
well,
you
don’t
schedule
the
sudden
breakdown.
the
point
is
that
it
is
true
that
power
will
flow.
frankly,
it
will
flow
mostly
from
gainesville
to
florida
power
according
to
the
staff
case,
but
it
is
true
that
instantaneously
as
if
a
load
goes
down
on
one
or
other
side
of
the
interconnection
power
will
flow.
but
that
doesn’t
mean
that
it
will
flow
forever.
it
can
be
shut
off
almost
immediately
if
the
power
is
needed
somewhere
else.
mr.
gordon
gooch
i
say
that
the
firm
customers
do
have
a
prior
claim
on
the
power.
yes,
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
but
not
the
pool
because
as
the
commission
evidence
showed
in
fact
by
installing
gainesville
into
the
pool
under
the
terms,
what
the
commission
was
really
trying
to
do
was
to
fit
gainesville
and
as
a
full-fledged
member
of
the
pool
without
being
having
to
pay
twice
dues
because
they
were
late
in
joining.
and
the
--
instead
of
getting
any
credit
for
having
done
that,
we’re
blamed
because
we
didn’t
follow
what
someone
else
says
the
industry
practices.
well,
of
course
the
commission
is
under
no
obligation
to
follow
with
the
industry
perhaps
says.
mr.
gordon
gooch
if
we
take
the
instances
at
which
were
not
in
the
record
but
mentioned
in
briefs
of
florida
power,
i
cause
those
specific
instances
to
be
check
by
the
section
of
the
federal
power
commission
who
reviews
those
things.
and
they
informed
me
that
if
we
were
to
resolve
that
kind
of
dispute
at
this
hearing
that
they
would
testify
that
none
of
the
contract
cited
by
florida
power
corporation
can
attain
the
kind
of
standby
charged
at
florida.
mr.
gordon
gooch
well,
sir
on
page
26
of
their
brief,
they
refer
to
a
12-megawatt
sale
which
is
i
believe
the
one
that
mr.
emory
was
referring
to.
that
was
in
our
view
an
entirely
different
situation
because
the
line
was
placed
in
for
the
benefit
of
florida
power’s
customers.
now,
subsequent
to
the
time
that
the
evidence
was
in
in
this
case,
subsequent
to
that
time,
the
florida
power
corporation
came
in
and
said,
that
they
have
negotiated,
they
deal
with
another
company
which
they
had
imposed
some
sort
of
standby
charge.
mr.
gordon
gooch
well,
yes.
mr.
gordon
gooch
that
was
my
understanding,
but
the
point
that
causes
the
problem
is
that
the
only
reason
to
bring
up
that
kind
of
point
is
to
claim
that
the
federal
power
commission
gave
gainesville
better
membership
conditions
in
the
pool
and
others
have.
now,
we
say
that’s
not
sole
and
the
all
the
evidence
shows
that
gainesville
has
the
same
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
and
the
second,
i’m
just
getting
to
ready
to
bring
up,
and
that
is
that
the
commission
specifically
provided
in
its
order
that
florida
power
corporation
may
file
for
a
rate
increase
under
the
commission’s
regulations
if
they’re
not
getting
what
they
think
they’re
entitled
to
under
the
service
of
the
interconnection.
mr.
gordon
gooch
precisely,
and
the
commission
--
the
expert
evidence
on
which
the
commission
rely
showed
that
the
city
of
gainesville
would
be
providing
proportionately
more
service
to
florida
power
than
otherwise.
now,
i’d
like
to
touch
on
that
point
for
a
second
if
i
may.
50
to
60
megawatts,
florida
power
admits
that
they
can
give
50
or
60
megawatts
without
even
filling
at
their
system.
they
got
a
swing
of
30
to
40
megawatts
that
they
say
that
it
means
nothing
to
them.
but
i
say
that
50
megawatts
going
back
across
the
interconnection
from
gainesville
to
florida
power
can’t
be
too
insignificant
if
florida
power
is
buying
firm
from
tiny
orlando
at
100
megawatts.
if
the
interconnection
--
the
valid
interconnection
between
the
florida
power
system
and
its
neighbors
to
the
north
and
georgia
will
open
at
130
megawatts,
if
florida
power
will
negotiate
a
12-megawatt
transaction
and
then
cited
in
their
brief
as
an
example.
and
if
as
the
minutes
of
the
florida
operating
committee
show
the
florida
operating
committee
does
not
even
maintain
at
all
times
adequate
spending
reserves
under
their
own
standards.
and
if
as
in
this
record,
the
city
of
gainesville
and
florida
power
corporation
are
arguing
over
service
to
individual
customers
in
alachua
county.
it
seems
to
me
that
we
cannot
argue
that
50
megawatts
is
insignificant
to
florida
power
corporation.
now,
the
commission
has
to
resolve
these
kind
of
disputes
all
the
time
and
then
have
to
resolve
the
disputes
not
only
because
it
is
a
dispute
between
parties,
but
because
they
have
an
affirmative
obligation
to
develop
a
policy
that
will
work
nationwide.
and
the
staff
tries
to
do
its
best
to
put
on
a
case
that
will
be
assistance
to
the
commission.
the
commission
doesn’t
of
course
always
take
the
best
part
of
anybody’s
case,
but
they
resolve
the
disputes
in
this
case.
they
set
the
rates
and
they
ordered
the
interconnection
and
we
believe
the
fifth
circuit
was
an
error
in
saying
if
the
commission
may
not
set
the
rate
on
the
basis
that
they
did.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
well,
it
is
disputed
in
the
sense
that
i
don’t
--
it’s
difficult
to
say.
yes,
it
was
disputed,
there
were
witnesses
that
said
that’s
just
a
mathematical
probability
and
the
mere
fact
that
it’s
mathematical
probability
it
doesn’t
mean
that
it
actually
will
happen.
there
were
plenty
of
arguments
to
the
way
that
addressed
to
the
commission,
but
i
do
not
recall
any
competing
exhibits
that
showed
different.
mr.
gordon
gooch
commission
found
that
it
was
likely
that
florida
power
would
be
drawing
on
the
interconnection
more
than
the
city
of
gainesville
would,
and
the
commission
then
by
imposing
the
same
standards
of
responsibility
on
gainesville
as
were
imposed
on
florida
power
by
the
operating
agreement.
the
commission
thought
there
was
an
equality
here
and
since
the
gainesville
can
at
some
periods
deliver
the
full
50
to
60
megawatts
and
not
all
the
time
across
the
interconnection.
mr.
gordon
gooch
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
that
particular
finding
was
not
entitled
to
weigh
under
the
substantial
evidence
rule.
the
commission
--
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
benefits
that
the
federal
power
commission
found
for
florida
power
system
were
vague
and
insubstantial.
and
the
court
said
that
because
of
the
firm
obligation
that
was
being
imposed
on
florida
power
by
the
commission’s
order,
that
a
standby
charge
was
an
order
and
the
commission
would
have
to
come
up
under
some
theory
to
do
this.
mr.
gordon
gooch
that’s
right.
the
commission
ordered
no
firm.
mr.
gordon
gooch
absolutely,
ordered
no
firm
and
if
there
was
any
doubt
that
the
commission
ordered
firm,
you
would
have
thought
that
florida
power
and
their
motion
for
rehearing
before
the
commission
would’ve
pointed
out
at
inconsistency
in
the
order
between
saying.
this
is
a
non-firm
order
as
to
the
interconnection
and
the
facilities
that
were
actually
being
ordered
in,
but
nothing
appears
in
their
rehearing.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
no,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
gooch
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
southeastern
power
administration
that
is
a
firm
100-megawatt
reserve
that’s
got
to
be
available
to
those
three
customers
at
all
times.
they
install
reserve
point,
florida
power
corporation
is
under
no
obligation
under
the
florida
operating
committee
rules
to
maintain
any
installed
reserves
and
i
strongly
suspect
that
15%
of
installed
reserves
would
look
awfully
good
to
the
florida
power
system
come
this
summer
on
turkey
point
didn’t
come
here.
next
point,
the
commission
imposed
on
the
city
of
gainesville
and
installed
reserve
capacity
that
would
see
to
it
that
it
would
always
be
self-sufficient.
the
only
thing
that
the
commission
provided
was
that
when
florida
power
can
help
its
little
neighbor
out,
it
should
do
so.
mr.
gordon
gooch
when
florida
power
had
the
ability
to
do
so.
now,
what
does
this
do
to
the
rate
payer
in
the
city
of
gainesville?
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
now,
the
reserve
that
gainesville
is
required
to
maintain
under
the
operating
committee
formula
is
one
thing.
what
it
has
the
capability
to
put
across
that
interconnection
is
another.
mr.
emory
would
have
you
to
believe
that
gainesville
system
is
so
adequate
and
so
small
that
it
has
response
and
only
two
outages
or
more.
i
point
out
as
in
the
brief,
they
have
the
two
15-megawatt
gas
turbines,
they
have
50-megawatt
generator
and
number
seven
unit
and
26-megawatt.
their
testimony
is
they
would
always
be
running
those
too.
the
seven,
number
seven
and
number
eight
and
have
the
other
two
available.
so
i
suggest
that
it
is
somewhat
unfair
to
the
city
of
gainesville
to
say
that
they
cannot
respond
with
emergency
power
across
that
interconnection.
now,
as
to
the
relative
benefits,
again,
by
imposing
on
the
city
of
gainesville
a
demand
charge
--
a
standby
charge
based
on
the
size
of
their
largest
unit,
what
that
effectively
does
through
rate
treatment
is
to
prevent
the
city
of
gainesville
from
increasing
the
size
of
its
larger
generators.
thereby,
increasing
the
amount
of
rate
that
the
citizens
in
gainesville
will
have
to
pay
if
t
they’re
going
to
be
an
isolated
system.
it
would
mean
that
they
would
have
to
buy
an
increments
of
small
or
less
sufficient
generators
so
they
could
always
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
if
there
is
--
well,
if
they
were
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
no,
sir.
oh,
as
the
alternative?
yes,
sir.
they
would
be
faced
with
the
economic
choice
of
not
completing
the
interconnection
and
building
their
own
generation.
and
the
federal
power
commission
has
recognized
just
like
florida
power
recognizes
that
that
it’s
uneconomic
and
wasteful
to
carry
more
--
install
a
capacity
then
you’re
going
to
need
for
a
reasonable
period
of
time.
and
so
rather
than
deprecate
the
city
of
gainesville
for
being
able
to
reduce
their
installed
capacity,
this
is
one
of
the
purposes,
one
of
the
benefits
of
interconnection.
and
florida
power
cannot
maintain
its
own
and
does
not
maintain
its
own
installed
reserves
by
itself
to
take
care
of
itself
in
the
event
of
major
outages
on
its
system.
so
it
is
easy
to,
i
suppose
deprecate
to
the
contribution
that
gainesville
can
make,
but
then
we
should
also
deprecate
the
contribution
that
orlando
makes
which
is
not
that
much
bigger
than
gainesville
which
includes
100-megawatt
firm
sale.
on
value
of
service,
it
seems
to
me
unnecessary
to
say
that
a
regulatory
commission
is
not
bound
to
take
into
consideration
the
value
of
service.
the
value
of
electricity
to
a
man
in
an
iron
long
is
a
lot
more
than
valuable
electricity
to
someone
making
coffee
in
the
morning,
but
that
has
not
been
and
has
not
in
this
case
the
basis
on
which
the
commission
sets
rates
for
utility.
