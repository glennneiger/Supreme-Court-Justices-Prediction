we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in

labine
against
vincent.
mr.
cox?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
cox,
in
many
if
not
most
states,
that
kind
of
acknowledgment
suppose
is
the
whole
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
mean
as
a
matter
of
statute?
statute
expressly
provides
that
the
acknowledgment
as
the
consequence
of
establishing
legitimacy
but
louisiana
statute
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
cox,
do
you
need
to
do
more
than
persuade
that
where
there
has
been
formal
acknowledgment
in
a
life
time
of
the
alleged
father
that
that’s
enough
to
satisfy
the
claim?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
do
you
have
to
do
any
more
than
that?
do
you
have
to
take
on
the
whole
class
including
those
who
never
had
the
benefit
of
that
acknowledgment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
couldn’t
get
anything
stronger
than
the
formal
acknowledgment
that
was
made
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
many
states
have
a
statute
that
would
be
satisfied
by
the
record
here,
do
you
happen
to
know?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
show
some
effort
for
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
was
puzzled
by
your
emphasis
on
that
in
your
brief,
what’s
the
real
connection
between
the
two?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
aren’t
you
confusing
the
declared
purpose
of
the
legislative
body
and
making
an
enactment
and
the
actual
consequence
is
nearly
as
anyone
can
discern
it.
they
can
have
as
it’s
the
declared
purpose
legitimately,
the
object
of
the
state.
it
doesn’t
prove
anything
that
the
statistics
have
some
tendency
to
go
the
other
way?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
you
don’t
know?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
no
way
of
knowing
that
absent
to
statute,
the
situation
might
not
be
a
lot
worse
in
louisiana?
that’s
my
point,
i
can’t
see
that
that’s
your
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
very
strong
how
impress
i
am.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that’s
my
point,
nobody
knows
and
therefore
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
reliable
yardstick
for
anything?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
cox
aren’t
you
in
a
stronger
ground
if
you
simply
take
the
old
thesis
that
one
of
the
predicates
on
this
problem
has
been
that
it
exposes
people
to
fraudulent
claims
which
are
difficult
to
establish
truth
either
way
and
that
none
of
those
factors
are
served
when
a
state
denies
this
right
to
one
as
to
whom
there
is
no
question
on
the
part
of
the
father?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
doesn’t
meet
the
problem
that
suppose
that
the
state
makes
a
will
for
all
people
who
do
not
take
the
trouble
to
make
one
for
themselves
and
the
man,
it’s
a
common
thing
for
lawyers
consulted
by
people
of
no
great
means
in
finding
out
what
they
want
to
do
to
tell
them
that
they
don’t
need
a
will
because
what
they
want
is
what
is
already
provided
for
by
the
statutes.
now,
i’m
certain
that
that’s
common
to
lawyers
all
over
the
country?
in
other
words,
they
say
the
state’s
made
a
will
for
you,
so
you
don’t
need
to
bother.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
leithead.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
somewhere
in
these
briefs
i
thought,
i
recalled
seeing
a
figure
on
the
total
number
--
estimated
total
number
of
illegitimate
people
in
the
country,
do
you
recall
the
figure?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
amicus
briefs
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it’s
a
very
large
number,
the
total
number
of
all
ages.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
while
you
were
pausing
here,
i’m
looking
at
page
8
of
the
appendix,
that’s
the
certificate
of
acknowledgment
of
paternity.
do
i
read
that
correctly
that
it
was
also
signed
by
the
mother?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
before
a
notary
public
and
two
witnesses?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that,
is
the
formality
of
executing
a
will
in
louisiana
any
more
complex
than
this?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
same
as
this
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
1962
apparently?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
social
security
had
to
pay
sometime
before
that
as
it
is?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
omitted
entirely?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
long
that
it’s
clear
that
the
omission
wasn’t
over
sized.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it’s
true
in
almost
all
the
states
in
this
country,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that’s
because
if
the
civil
law
of
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
wanting,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
benefit
that
he
conferred
by
this
acknowledgment
as
a
capitalized
value
of
24,000
did
you
say?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
leithead,
under
the
statute
of
louisiana
must
--
with
that
certificate
--
the
acknowledgment
had
been
valid
if
the
mother
had
not
also
joined
in
it,
but
must
both
of
them
join
in
the
acknowledgment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
--
how
much
more
would
they
had
to
say
on
this
certificate
of
paternity
in
order
to
confer
rights
of
inheritance
by
intestacy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
it’s
just
the
time
--
chief
justice
warren
e.

as
to
five
more
words
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.

thank
you
mr.

mr.
cox,
you
have
three
minutes
left,
i
think
i’ll
hold
my
question
until
you
finish
so
as
not
to
use
your
time
for
you.
chief

warren
e.
burger
on
what
ground
did
north

based
that
holding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
cox,
i
live
in
virginia
which
permits
a
testator
to
make
a
will,
i
think
anyway
he
wants
to
do
it,
he
cut
off
his
children,
i
suppose
that’s
true
in
49
of
the
states.
suppose,
i
make
the
will,
leaving
nothing
to
my
children,
do
they
have
a
claim
that
because
louisiana,
if
they
lived
in
louisiana,
i
could
not
have
cut
them
off
but
they
are
thereby
denied
equal
protection?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
got
a
class,
suppose
i
had
some
children
--
well,
children
in
louisiana
can
inherit
and
children
in
virginia
and
the
other
states
can’t.
chief
justice
warren
e.

you
don’t
see
any
equal
protection
problem
there
at
all.
chief
