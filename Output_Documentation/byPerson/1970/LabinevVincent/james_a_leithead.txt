mr.
james
a.
leithead
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
factually
doesn’t
present
any
question.
these
people
did
merely
came
in
after
ezra
vincent
died
and
said
they
were
the
brothers
and
sisters
and
wanted
to
open
his
succession
in
louisiana
under
the
intestate
laws,
if
a
person
dies
leaving
no
children,
then
you
look
to
the
interstate
laws
to
see
which
classes
of
persons
inherit
his
estate.
louisiana
has
legal
heirs
in
connection
with
the
intestate
succession.
in
this
particular
case,
since
ezra
vincent
didn’t
leave
any
children,
he
left
brothers
and
sisters
and
he
left
and
acknowledged
illegitimate
child.
under
the
laws
of
the
louisiana
intestate
succession
laws,
the
brothers
and
sisters
are
the
class
inherited
before
the
acknowledged
illegitimate
child.
now,
you
might
ask
--
mr.
james
a.
leithead
yes
sir.
the
acknowledged
--
you
might
ask
why
did
he
acknowledged
his
child.
first,
here
in
louisiana
you
have
an
illegitimate
child
which
is
the
lowest
you
can
get,
then
you
have
an
acknowledged
illegitimate
child
and
that
acknowledged
illegitimate
child
is
raised
in
his
status
as
being
able
to
inherit,
he
can
inherit
from
his
mother
just
after
her
legitimate
children.
he
can
inherit
from
the
father
just
after
the
wife
which
were
just
before
the
state.
he
doesn’t
have
as
high
an
inheritance
position
in
the
state
of
his
father
as
he
does
in
his
mother
because
louisiana
recognize
the
natural
law
that
a
child
is
closer
to
its
mother
than
it
is
to
his
father
but
he
doesn’t
--
he
does
have
inheritance
right.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
this
child
would
have
inherited
because
the
law
states
that
if
a
man
dies
leaving
no
legitimate
children,
no
mother
and
father
and
no
surviving
wife,
then
his
acknowledged
child
would
inherit.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
no,
i
say
it,
so
the
child
would
have
inherited
if
he
didn’t
have
brothers
and
sisters.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
come
ahead.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
that’s
correct.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
that’s
correct.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
proof
of
motherhood
is
very
easily
made,
mother
knows
as
usually
witnesses,
a
midwife
or
something
as
to
the
birth
of
the
child
but
the
children,
natural
children
of
a
mother
come
in
just
after
her
legitimate
children.
if
she
had
no
legitimate
children,
they
would
inherit
to
the
exclusion
of
all
other
persons
under
the
intestate
laws
of
the
state.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
the
state
realizes
that
the
mother
has
a
close
family
connection
to
the
--
well,
to
answer
to
question,
the
state
of
louisiana
prefers
--
mr.
james
a.
leithead
yes.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
yes,
the
state
of
louisiana
has
a
state
policy
preferring
legitimacy
over
illegitimacy
and
in
connection
with
that
policy,
it’s
obvious
that
they
prefer
legitimate
heirs
to
illegitimate
heirs
and
their
policy
is
a
--
it
is
to
promote
marriage
and
discourage
illegitimacy
and
also
for
the
protection
of
their
land
titles.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
that
is
correct,
but
if
the
parents
wish
to,
they
could
prevent
the
illegitimate
child
from
suffering
by
doing
some
other
things
and
that
is
they
could
legitimate
the
child
by
informally
acknowledging
the
child
before
or
after
a
marriage
if
they
could
marry,
they
could
adopt
him
or
they
could
leave
a
will.
so
there’s
an
avenue
that
they
could
change
the
course
of
events.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
the
child
cannot
change
any
course
of
events.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
that’s
right.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
i
don’t
remember
what
those
figures
are
your
honor,
that
must
be
an
amicus
curiae
brief.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
wasn’t
in
my
--
mr.
james
a.
leithead
yes.
and
my
comment
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
in
the
levy
case,
justice
douglas
stated
that
the
court
assumed
that
the
minor
children
there
had
a
family
relationship
with
their
mother.
that
is
the
mother
supported
them,
that’s
is
where
the
illegitimate
children
sought
under
louisiana
wrongful
death
statute
to
recover
damages
for
the
death
of
their
natural
mother,
that
there
was
a
family
relationship,
the
mother
supported
them,
she
took
them
to
church,
she
took
them
to
school,
she
cared
for
them,
she
lived
with
them
but
there’s
none
of
those
facts
are
in
the
record
of
this
case.
this
case
shows
--
does
not
show
that
ezra
lived
with
the
child
.in
fact,
the
evidence
is
just
to
the
contrary.
if
you’ll
notice
the
acknowledgment
papers
and
the
birth
certificate,
it’ll
show
that
the
address
of
the
mother
was
something
on
belton
street
in
lake
charles
louisiana,
whereas
ezra
and
his
family
lived
in
a
little
town
called
moss
ville
which
is
10
--
across
10
or
12
miles
away.
now,
the
fact
that
there
was
no
marriage
certificate
between
ezra’s
father
and
mother
is
due
to
the
fact
that
there
were
no
marriage
records
in
(inaudible)
parish
where
this
man
lived
prior
to
1910.
and
his
brothers
and
sisters
all
were
born
prior
to
that
time.
so
there’s
no
marriage
records
nor
were
there
any
birth
certificates.
so,
we
had
to
prove
the
marriage
relationship
of
ezra’s
mother
and
father
by
their
reputation
in
the
community.
and
in
so
doing,
we
found
out
that
this
interest
in
this
property
that
ezra
vincent
left
was
real
property,
he
had
eight
brothers
and
sisters
--
seven
brothers
and
sisters.
1/8th
of
it
constituted
the
bulk
of
this
succession
which
amounted
to
proximate
$15,000.00,
that
was
a
family
home
and
ezra
and
his
brothers
and
sisters
lived
there,
they
formed
the
property,
they
went
to
the
baptist
church
together.
his
grandfather
was
a
baptist
minister.
their
reputation
in
the
community
was
such
as
to
be
the
highest.
they
were
recognized.
his
family
was
recognized
as
prominent
citizens.
so
there
was
a
family
relationship
between
ezra,
his
brothers
and
sisters
and
their
parents,
whereas,
this
was
not
shown
to
be
the
case
by
the
evidence
as
presented
in
this
case.
now,
in
common
law,
an
illegitimate
was
known
as
a
non-person,
he
was
not
entitled
to
inherit
anything.
louisiana
law
as
i
have
stated
permits
them
to
inherit
but
not
as
high
upon
the
ladder
as
legitimate
relations.
the
civil
law
has
historically
treated
illegitimates
more
favorable
than
illegitimates
by
letting
them
inherit
from
their
mother.
the
most
modern
statutes
now
permit
illegitimate
children
to
inherit
from
their
mother
but
prohibit
or
deny
them
to
inherit
from
their
father.
now
we
get
down,
we’ve
been
talking
about
the
child
in
this
case.
i
think
the
court
should
also
give
some
consideration
to
the
decedent.
now,
when
he
died,
the
laws
of
the
state
of
louisiana,
the
intestate
laws
were
--
was
that
his
property,
his
family
property
would
be
inherited
by
his
brothers
and
sisters.
now,
at
that
time,
ezra
had
a
choice
to
make.
he
could
say
now
look,
i
want
to
leave
this
child
something.
i
want
to
make
a
will.
he
could
have
done
that
or
he
could
have
said
i
want
to
marry
the
mother
of
the
child,
there
was
no
impediment
to
the
marriage.
or
he
could
have
adopted
the
child.
anyone
of
those
things
would
have
changed
the
course
of
these
events.
now
once
ezra
died,
he
no
longer
can
exercise
any
choice
when
die
was
cast.
this
court
cannot
revert
this
case
back
to
before
his
death
and
say
now,
ezra,
you
have
the
choice,
what
do
you
want
to
do
because
what
he
did
indicates
what
his
choice
was.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
that’s
correct.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
a
small
one
–if
you
have
one
child,
the
fourth
portion
is
1/3
that
you
have
to
leave
the
child,
2/3
you
can
give
them.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
right.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
that’s
correct.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
right
your
honor.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
there
is
--
no
sir,
there
is
--
a
will
maybe
executed
in
louisiana
before
a
notary
public
and
two
witnesses.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
same
as
this,
say
--
and
the
notary
public
has
authority
to
take
a
will,
so
at
the
same
time
these
parties
were
doing
this,
if
ezra
wanted
to,
he
could
with
--
had
signed
the
will
and
left
his
property
to
his
acknowledged
child.
so
all
of
that
indicates
that
it
was
not
his
intention
to
leave
the
family
property
to
this
acknowledged
child,
but
rather
to
keep
it
with
his
brothers
and
sisters.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
he
indicates
to
my
way
of
thinking
that
if
ezra
was
in
the
notary’s
office
and
had
two
witnesses
and
did
not
sign
a
will,
at
that
time
living
his
property
to
his
acknowledged
child.
it
would
indicate
that
he
did
not
want
to
do
that.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
to
provide
for
the
child
support.
now,
the
child
did
was
to
immediately
receive
$35.00
a
month
from
the
social
security
administration
while
ezra
was
living
and
after
his
death,
is
receiving
between
social
security
on
veterans
administration
a
$100.00
a
month.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
it’s
on
page
eight
of
the
appendix,
1962.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
1962
your
honor.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
yes.
now,
--
mr.
james
a.
leithead
yes
sir.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
that’s
right,
under
the
social
security
act.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
that’s
correct,
that
by
statute.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
that’s
exactly
correct.
that
by
statute
under
the
social
security
administration
and
va
administration
acknowledged
child
participate.
now,
i’m
not
saying
that
this
is
not
a
hard
case
factually,
it
is.
but
chief
justice
--
mr.
james
a.
leithead
well,
it
means
that
a
man
came
in
and
acknowledged
this
child
and
the
child
--
the
brothers
and
sisters
come
in
inherit
before
the
child.
this
might
be
considered
by
some
to
be
a
hard
case
factually.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
right
and
that’s
equivalent
to
$24,000.00
at
5%
interest.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
that
is
true
and
in
some
case,
some
states
so
i
informed
that
there
is
no
forced
heirship
and
the
child
maybe
left
just
by
testament
of
mere
pittance
where
another
child
maybe
cleared.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
or
omitted
entirely.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
yes,
if
--
mr.
james
a.
leithead
yes,
but
in
louisiana,
no
sir,
you
cannot
do
that.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
civil
law.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
you
must
leave
the
forced
heirs,
their
forced
portion
and
the
forced
heirs
in
louisiana
are
lawful
children
and
parents.
but
as
i
say
this
may
appear
to
some
to
be
a
hard
case
factually,
but
i’d
like
to
remind
the
court
of
a
speech
that
made
by
chief
justice
burger,
while
then
a
united
state
circuit
court
judge
when
he
delivered
and
address
at
the
conference
of
judges
in
columbus
ohio
on
september
4,
1968
from
which
the
following
is
an
exurb
and
i
think
its
pertinent.
this
copy
was
given
to
me
by
mr.
ben
miller
from
baton
rouge
.the
chief
justice
said
"these
hard
cases
usually
come
to
the
court
over
the
narrow
record
of
but
one
case
which
frequently
presents
emotionally
appealing
situations
that
confuse
and
blur
the
bedrock
consequences
of
a
broad
holding."
the
address
was
published
in
the
ohio
bar
volume
41
number
46
dated
november
23rd
1968
pages
1440
and
1441.
now,
in
my
opinion,
pandora’s
box
would
be
open
by
any
holding
that
federal
law
as
declared
by
federal
courts
and
not
even
by
congress
and
not
by
state
law
would
govern
succession
rights
in
all
of
the
50
states
and
overrule
a
states
law
on
inheritance
of
property
in
that
state
particularly
recent
state.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
the
record
does
show
in
its
approximate
$15,000.00
in
property
real
estate.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
yes
sir.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
capitalized
at
5%,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
yes
your
honor.
the
child
would
have
to
come
in
and
prove
the
paternity.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
no,
no,
oh,
no,
if
there
had
been,
the
acknowledgment
--
the
father
--
the
estate
would
still
have
to
support
the
child,
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
it
supports
the
child,
if
the
child
is
21
or
until
the
child
can
earn
a
living
for
himself,
it’s
doing
minority.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
the
trial
judge
reasoned
this
way.
in
divorce
cases
in
louisiana,
in
the
jurisdictions
where
we
are,
a
child
in
a
divorce
case
gets
between
$60.00
and
$75.00
per
month
support
and
the
trial
judge
felt
that
this
child
was
receiving
a
$100.00
a
month
support
and
that
was
sufficient
for
the
child’s
support.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
no
sir.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
the
statute
just
says
what
is
necessary
for
the
support
of
the
child
and
is
left
up
to
the
discretion
of
the
court,
the
trial
court.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
may
have
been
and
may
have
been
just
the
opposite
and
the
state
shouldn’t
contribute
so
much
money
from
it.
considering
some
of
the
bedrock,
i
mean
some
of
the
analogies
to
this
case
and
some
of
the
bedrock
consequences
which
may
--
we
may
get
into
by
a
broad
holding
and
this
court,
this
case
before
the
court
in
the
area
of
adoptions,
their
rights
and
obligations.
most
states
permit
a
married
couple
to
adopt
the
child,
some
states
say
that
an
unmarried
man
and
an
unmarried
woman
may
adopt,
others
say
just
an
unmarried
woman
may
adopt.
some
states
may
wish
to
deny
inheritance
rights
to
an
adopted
child
or
some
may
want
to
give
the
adopted
parents
of
the
child
some
rights
in
the
child’s
estate,
but
what
would
happen
if
a
state
would
suddenly
declare
that
they
would
change
their
policy
only
prospectively
and
deny
adopted
children
inheritance
rights,
and
in
real
property
in
the
state.
if
that
is
to
declare
it
unconstitutional
as
a
discriminary
against
the
innocent
child
in
some
other
hard
case
who
believed
that
he
was
the
child
of
his
parents
but
later
was
decided
he
was
the
adopted
child.
the
child
would
come
out
without
anything.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
there’s
no
--
mr.
james
a.
leithead
there’s
no
prohibitions
that
i
know
off
that
he
could
not.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
yes
your
honor.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
no
sir.
the
child
is
entitled
to
support.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
he
has
to
be
acknowledged
or
legitimated.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
you
say
if
the
child
was
adopted?
mr.
james
a.
leithead
or
legitimated.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
now,
legitimated
is
when
the
persons
maybe
done
by
a
notarial
act
where
you
go
before
the
notary
and
say
that
this
is
my
child
and
i
want
him
to
be
my
heir
and
i
want
him
to
inherit
from
me,
that
is
a
legitimation.
there
is
no
--
it
has
to
be
specific.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
that’s
under
louisiana
law,
are
--
that
are
the
parties,
the
man,
the
mother
and
the
father
of
the
child
may
marry.
if
they
marry
either
before
or
after
the
child
is
born
and
consider
the
child
as
their
child,
the
child
is
legitimated
by
that
act
of
marriage.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
no,
just
go
into
the
court’s
church
and
get
married
and
just
having
the
child
live
in
a
home
with
them
and
acknowledge
him.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
there’s
two
ways
of
doing
a
legitimizing.
one
before
notary
and
a
document
that
is
signed.
the
other
is
by
actions
of
the
parties
by
actually
being
married
and
acknowledging
informally
or
in
writing
that
the
child
is
theirs.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
yes
your
honor.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
the
father
did
not
legitimize
her
before
a
notary
public
and
he
did
not
marry
the
natural
mother
or
he
did
not
of
course
leave
a
will
or
adopt
the
child.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
no.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
to
my
understanding
is
they
do
both
or
if
the
--
only
the
husband
signs
the
acknowledgment,
it
is
not
binding
on
the
mother,
it's
only
binding
on
those
who
actually
acknowledge.
i’m
not
quite
sure
but
i
believe
either
one
could
acknowledge
but
it’s
only
binding
on
the
one
who
does.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
they
wouldn’t
had
to
say
that
they
acknowledged
that
--
ezra
vincent
would
have
had
to
say
that
he
was
the
father
of
this
child
and
that
he
acknowledged
the
child
as
his
child
and
granted
him
the
right
to
inherit
from
him,
it
has
to
be
specific.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
a
similar
to
a
will,
it
has
to
be
--
mr.
james
a.
leithead
well,
i’m
just
giving
you
those
in
my
words.
it
could
be
less
or
more
than
five
words
but
you
wouldn’t
have
to
express
his
intention
because
this
does
not
in
itself
express
his
intention
to
allow
the
child
to
inherit
from
him.
i
might
say
another
analogy
to
this
case
is
that
louisiana
code
prohibits
divorced
spouses
from
marrying
his
or
her
concubine.
now,
is
the
state
to
be
denied
this
policy
because
it
might
be
denied
of
persons
of
equal
protection
on
the
constitution.
i
see
my
time
is
running
out,
i’d
like
to
--
mr.
james
a.
leithead
louisiana
does
not
recognize
common
law
marriages
although
many
states
do
and
louisiana
and
other
states
have
different
laws
in
respect
to
putative
marriages.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
there’s
never
been
any
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
--
no
sir,
that
question
has
never
been
raised
in
louisiana.
whether
or
not
that
is
a
constitutional
problems
of
the
state
in
its
policy
decision,
whether
or
not,
not
to
recognize
common
law
marriages
and
to
require
that
people
married
and
living
together
should
go
through
a
ceremony.
that
question
has
never
been
risen.
but
if
would
be
risen,
would
arise
would
that
be
constitutional
for
the
state
to
pass
such
a
statute.
the
implications
of
this
case
are
maybe
far
reaching.
far
more
reaching
than
what
the
narrow
issues
that
are
presented
before
this
court,
once
this
court
decides
that
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
is
going
to
pass
upon
the
dissent
and
distribution
of
laws
in
the
50
state,
in
my
opinion,
the
court
would
have
to
legislate
on
many
items
and
make
decisions
and
decide
many
points
in
succession
law
which
will
be
most
complicated
for
instance.
in
this
particular,
in
louisiana,
these
are
some
of
the
things
the
court
would
have
to
decide
whether
or
not
an
illegitimate
child,
whether
the
illegitimate
child
would
inherit
from
its
father
equally
with
a
legitimate
child.
you
see,
this
makes
a
difference
because
in
louisiana,
we
have
the
forced
heirship
in
some
of
the
other
common
law
states,
it
may
not
make
any
difference.
will
and
adulteress
and
illegitimate
child
inherit
the
same
as
an
illegitimate
child
who
is
not
an
adulteress
illegitimate
child,
there
should
have
been
a
distinction
made.
will
an
illegitimate
child
who
is
informally
acknowledged
inherit
just
as
well
as
one
that
is
formally
acknowledged?
will
that
make
a
distinction
if
the
father
have
an
illegitimate
child
and
later
the
mother
and
the
father
married,
would
that
make
any
difference
as
to
the
rights
of
inheritance.
would
the
illegitimate
child
of
the
father
of
the
father’s
concubine
inherit
his
one
half
interest
in
the
community
property
of
the
father
with
his
legitimate
wife?
will
illegitimate
children
inherit
to
the
exclusion
of
the
decedent’s
parents
who
are
forced
heirs
if
there
are
no
other
children
or
would
the
illegitimate
child,
no
matter
how
it
would
be
acknowledged,
would
he
be
considered
a
forced
heir.
these
are
all
many
questions
that
would
have
to
be
answered
and
the
court
would
be
legislating
in
my
opinion,
if
they
would
attempt
to
decide
that
the
intestate
laws
in
this
--
that
are
before
this
court
for
decision
are
unconstitutional,
we
submit
that
the
court
below,
the
decision
of
the
court
below
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
factually
doesn’t
present
any
question.
these
people
did
merely
came
in
after
ezra
vincent
died
and
said
they
were
the
brothers
and
sisters
and
wanted
to
open
his
succession
in
louisiana
under
the
intestate
laws,
if
a
person
dies
leaving
no
children,
then
you
look
to
the
interstate
laws
to
see
which
classes
of
persons
inherit
his
estate.
louisiana
has
legal
heirs
in
connection
with
the
intestate
succession.
in
this
particular
case,
since
ezra
vincent
didn’t
leave
any
children,
he
left
brothers
and
sisters
and
he
left
and
acknowledged
illegitimate
child.
under
the
laws
of
the
louisiana
intestate
succession
laws,
the
brothers
and
sisters
are
the
class
inherited
before
the
acknowledged
illegitimate
child.
now,
you
might
ask
--
mr.
james
a.
leithead
yes
sir.
the
acknowledged
--
you
might
ask
why
did
he
acknowledged
his
child.
first,
here
in
louisiana
you
have
an
illegitimate
child
which
is
the
lowest
you
can
get,
then
you
have
an
acknowledged
illegitimate
child
and
that
acknowledged
illegitimate
child
is
raised
in
his
status
as
being
able
to
inherit,
he
can
inherit
from
his
mother
just
after
her
legitimate
children.
he
can
inherit
from
the
father
just
after
the
wife
which
were
just
before
the
state.
he
doesn’t
have
as
high
an
inheritance
position
in
the
state
of
his
father
as
he
does
in
his
mother
because
louisiana
recognize
the
natural
law
that
a
child
is
closer
to
its
mother
than
it
is
to
his
father
but
he
doesn’t
--
he
does
have
inheritance
right.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
this
child
would
have
inherited
because
the
law
states
that
if
a
man
dies
leaving
no
legitimate
children,
no
mother
and
father
and
no
surviving
wife,
then
his
acknowledged
child
would
inherit.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
no,
i
say
it,
so
the
child
would
have
inherited
if
he
didn’t
have
brothers
and
sisters.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
come
ahead.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
that’s
correct.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
that’s
correct.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
proof
of
motherhood
is
very
easily
made,
mother
knows
as
usually
witnesses,
a
midwife
or
something
as
to
the
birth
of
the
child
but
the
children,
natural
children
of
a
mother
come
in
just
after
her
legitimate
children.
if
she
had
no
legitimate
children,
they
would
inherit
to
the
exclusion
of
all
other
persons
under
the
intestate
laws
of
the
state.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
the
state
realizes
that
the
mother
has
a
close
family
connection
to
the
--
well,
to
answer
to
question,
the
state
of
louisiana
prefers
--
mr.
james
a.
leithead
yes.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
yes,
the
state
of
louisiana
has
a
state
policy
preferring
legitimacy
over
illegitimacy
and
in
connection
with
that
policy,
it’s
obvious
that
they
prefer
legitimate
heirs
to
illegitimate
heirs
and
their
policy
is
a
--
it
is
to
promote
marriage
and
discourage
illegitimacy
and
also
for
the
protection
of
their
land
titles.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
that
is
correct,
but
if
the
parents
wish
to,
they
could
prevent
the
illegitimate
child
from
suffering
by
doing
some
other
things
and
that
is
they
could
legitimate
the
child
by
informally
acknowledging
the
child
before
or
after
a
marriage
if
they
could
marry,
they
could
adopt
him
or
they
could
leave
a
will.
so
there’s
an
avenue
that
they
could
change
the
course
of
events.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
the
child
cannot
change
any
course
of
events.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
that’s
right.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
i
don’t
remember
what
those
figures
are
your
honor,
that
must
be
an
amicus
curiae
brief.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
wasn’t
in
my
--
mr.
james
a.
leithead
yes.
and
my
comment
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
in
the
levy
case,
justice
douglas
stated
that
the
court
assumed
that
the
minor
children
there
had
a
family
relationship
with
their
mother.
that
is
the
mother
supported
them,
that’s
is
where
the
illegitimate
children
sought
under
louisiana
wrongful
death
statute
to
recover
damages
for
the
death
of
their
natural
mother,
that
there
was
a
family
relationship,
the
mother
supported
them,
she
took
them
to
church,
she
took
them
to
school,
she
cared
for
them,
she
lived
with
them
but
there’s
none
of
those
facts
are
in
the
record
of
this
case.
this
case
shows
--
does
not
show
that
ezra
lived
with
the
child
.in
fact,
the
evidence
is
just
to
the
contrary.
if
you’ll
notice
the
acknowledgment
papers
and
the
birth
certificate,
it’ll
show
that
the
address
of
the
mother
was
something
on
belton
street
in
lake
charles
louisiana,
whereas
ezra
and
his
family
lived
in
a
little
town
called
moss
ville
which
is
10
--
across
10
or
12
miles
away.
now,
the
fact
that
there
was
no
marriage
certificate
between
ezra’s
father
and
mother
is
due
to
the
fact
that
there
were
no
marriage
records
in
(inaudible)
parish
where
this
man
lived
prior
to
1910.
and
his
brothers
and
sisters
all
were
born
prior
to
that
time.
so
there’s
no
marriage
records
nor
were
there
any
birth
certificates.
so,
we
had
to
prove
the
marriage
relationship
of
ezra’s
mother
and
father
by
their
reputation
in
the
community.
and
in
so
doing,
we
found
out
that
this
interest
in
this
property
that
ezra
vincent
left
was
real
property,
he
had
eight
brothers
and
sisters
--
seven
brothers
and
sisters.
1/8th
of
it
constituted
the
bulk
of
this
succession
which
amounted
to
proximate
$15,000.00,
that
was
a
family
home
and
ezra
and
his
brothers
and
sisters
lived
there,
they
formed
the
property,
they
went
to
the
baptist
church
together.
his
grandfather
was
a
baptist
minister.
their
reputation
in
the
community
was
such
as
to
be
the
highest.
they
were
recognized.
his
family
was
recognized
as
prominent
citizens.
so
there
was
a
family
relationship
between
ezra,
his
brothers
and
sisters
and
their
parents,
whereas,
this
was
not
shown
to
be
the
case
by
the
evidence
as
presented
in
this
case.
now,
in
common
law,
an
illegitimate
was
known
as
a
non-person,
he
was
not
entitled
to
inherit
anything.
louisiana
law
as
i
have
stated
permits
them
to
inherit
but
not
as
high
upon
the
ladder
as
legitimate
relations.
the
civil
law
has
historically
treated
illegitimates
more
favorable
than
illegitimates
by
letting
them
inherit
from
their
mother.
the
most
modern
statutes
now
permit
illegitimate
children
to
inherit
from
their
mother
but
prohibit
or
deny
them
to
inherit
from
their
father.
now
we
get
down,
we’ve
been
talking
about
the
child
in
this
case.
i
think
the
court
should
also
give
some
consideration
to
the
decedent.
now,
when
he
died,
the
laws
of
the
state
of
louisiana,
the
intestate
laws
were
--
was
that
his
property,
his
family
property
would
be
inherited
by
his
brothers
and
sisters.
now,
at
that
time,
ezra
had
a
choice
to
make.
he
could
say
now
look,
i
want
to
leave
this
child
something.
i
want
to
make
a
will.
he
could
have
done
that
or
he
could
have
said
i
want
to
marry
the
mother
of
the
child,
there
was
no
impediment
to
the
marriage.
or
he
could
have
adopted
the
child.
anyone
of
those
things
would
have
changed
the
course
of
these
events.
now
once
ezra
died,
he
no
longer
can
exercise
any
choice
when
die
was
cast.
this
court
cannot
revert
this
case
back
to
before
his
death
and
say
now,
ezra,
you
have
the
choice,
what
do
you
want
to
do
because
what
he
did
indicates
what
his
choice
was.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
that’s
correct.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
a
small
one
–if
you
have
one
child,
the
fourth
portion
is
1/3
that
you
have
to
leave
the
child,
2/3
you
can
give
them.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
right.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
that’s
correct.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
right
your
honor.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
there
is
--
no
sir,
there
is
--
a
will
maybe
executed
in
louisiana
before
a
notary
public
and
two
witnesses.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
same
as
this,
say
--
and
the
notary
public
has
authority
to
take
a
will,
so
at
the
same
time
these
parties
were
doing
this,
if
ezra
wanted
to,
he
could
with
--
had
signed
the
will
and
left
his
property
to
his
acknowledged
child.
so
all
of
that
indicates
that
it
was
not
his
intention
to
leave
the
family
property
to
this
acknowledged
child,
but
rather
to
keep
it
with
his
brothers
and
sisters.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
he
indicates
to
my
way
of
thinking
that
if
ezra
was
in
the
notary’s
office
and
had
two
witnesses
and
did
not
sign
a
will,
at
that
time
living
his
property
to
his
acknowledged
child.
it
would
indicate
that
he
did
not
want
to
do
that.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
to
provide
for
the
child
support.
now,
the
child
did
was
to
immediately
receive
$35.00
a
month
from
the
social
security
administration
while
ezra
was
living
and
after
his
death,
is
receiving
between
social
security
on
veterans
administration
a
$100.00
a
month.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
it’s
on
page
eight
of
the
appendix,
1962.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
1962
your
honor.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
yes.
now,
--
mr.
james
a.
leithead
yes
sir.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
that’s
right,
under
the
social
security
act.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
that’s
correct,
that
by
statute.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
that’s
exactly
correct.
that
by
statute
under
the
social
security
administration
and
va
administration
acknowledged
child
participate.
now,
i’m
not
saying
that
this
is
not
a
hard
case
factually,
it
is.
but
chief
justice
--
mr.
james
a.
leithead
well,
it
means
that
a
man
came
in
and
acknowledged
this
child
and
the
child
--
the
brothers
and
sisters
come
in
inherit
before
the
child.
this
might
be
considered
by
some
to
be
a
hard
case
factually.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
right
and
that’s
equivalent
to
$24,000.00
at
5%
interest.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
that
is
true
and
in
some
case,
some
states
so
i
informed
that
there
is
no
forced
heirship
and
the
child
maybe
left
just
by
testament
of
mere
pittance
where
another
child
maybe
cleared.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
or
omitted
entirely.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
yes,
if
--
mr.
james
a.
leithead
yes,
but
in
louisiana,
no
sir,
you
cannot
do
that.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
civil
law.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
you
must
leave
the
forced
heirs,
their
forced
portion
and
the
forced
heirs
in
louisiana
are
lawful
children
and
parents.
but
as
i
say
this
may
appear
to
some
to
be
a
hard
case
factually,
but
i’d
like
to
remind
the
court
of
a
speech
that
made
by
chief
justice
burger,
while
then
a
united
state
circuit
court
judge
when
he
delivered
and
address
at
the
conference
of
judges
in
columbus
ohio
on
september
4,
1968
from
which
the
following
is
an
exurb
and
i
think
its
pertinent.
this
copy
was
given
to
me
by
mr.
ben
miller
from
baton
rouge
.the
chief
justice
said
"these
hard
cases
usually
come
to
the
court
over
the
narrow
record
of
but
one
case
which
frequently
presents
emotionally
appealing
situations
that
confuse
and
blur
the
bedrock
consequences
of
a
broad
holding."
the
address
was
published
in
the
ohio
bar
volume
41
number
46
dated
november
23rd
1968
pages
1440
and
1441.
now,
in
my
opinion,
pandora’s
box
would
be
open
by
any
holding
that
federal
law
as
declared
by
federal
courts
and
not
even
by
congress
and
not
by
state
law
would
govern
succession
rights
in
all
of
the
50
states
and
overrule
a
states
law
on
inheritance
of
property
in
that
state
particularly
recent
state.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
the
record
does
show
in
its
approximate
$15,000.00
in
property
real
estate.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
yes
sir.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
capitalized
at
5%,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
yes
your
honor.
the
child
would
have
to
come
in
and
prove
the
paternity.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
no,
no,
oh,
no,
if
there
had
been,
the
acknowledgment
--
the
father
--
the
estate
would
still
have
to
support
the
child,
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
it
supports
the
child,
if
the
child
is
21
or
until
the
child
can
earn
a
living
for
himself,
it’s
doing
minority.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
the
trial
judge
reasoned
this
way.
in
divorce
cases
in
louisiana,
in
the
jurisdictions
where
we
are,
a
child
in
a
divorce
case
gets
between
$60.00
and
$75.00
per
month
support
and
the
trial
judge
felt
that
this
child
was
receiving
a
$100.00
a
month
support
and
that
was
sufficient
for
the
child’s
support.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
no
sir.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
the
statute
just
says
what
is
necessary
for
the
support
of
the
child
and
is
left
up
to
the
discretion
of
the
court,
the
trial
court.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
may
have
been
and
may
have
been
just
the
opposite
and
the
state
shouldn’t
contribute
so
much
money
from
it.
considering
some
of
the
bedrock,
i
mean
some
of
the
analogies
to
this
case
and
some
of
the
bedrock
consequences
which
may
--
we
may
get
into
by
a
broad
holding
and
this
court,
this
case
before
the
court
in
the
area
of
adoptions,
their
rights
and
obligations.
most
states
permit
a
married
couple
to
adopt
the
child,
some
states
say
that
an
unmarried
man
and
an
unmarried
woman
may
adopt,
others
say
just
an
unmarried
woman
may
adopt.
some
states
may
wish
to
deny
inheritance
rights
to
an
adopted
child
or
some
may
want
to
give
the
adopted
parents
of
the
child
some
rights
in
the
child’s
estate,
but
what
would
happen
if
a
state
would
suddenly
declare
that
they
would
change
their
policy
only
prospectively
and
deny
adopted
children
inheritance
rights,
and
in
real
property
in
the
state.
if
that
is
to
declare
it
unconstitutional
as
a
discriminary
against
the
innocent
child
in
some
other
hard
case
who
believed
that
he
was
the
child
of
his
parents
but
later
was
decided
he
was
the
adopted
child.
the
child
would
come
out
without
anything.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
there’s
no
--
mr.
james
a.
leithead
there’s
no
prohibitions
that
i
know
off
that
he
could
not.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
yes
your
honor.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
no
sir.
the
child
is
entitled
to
support.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
he
has
to
be
acknowledged
or
legitimated.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
you
say
if
the
child
was
adopted?
mr.
james
a.
leithead
or
legitimated.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
now,
legitimated
is
when
the
persons
maybe
done
by
a
notarial
act
where
you
go
before
the
notary
and
say
that
this
is
my
child
and
i
want
him
to
be
my
heir
and
i
want
him
to
inherit
from
me,
that
is
a
legitimation.
there
is
no
--
it
has
to
be
specific.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
that’s
under
louisiana
law,
are
--
that
are
the
parties,
the
man,
the
mother
and
the
father
of
the
child
may
marry.
if
they
marry
either
before
or
after
the
child
is
born
and
consider
the
child
as
their
child,
the
child
is
legitimated
by
that
act
of
marriage.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
no,
just
go
into
the
court’s
church
and
get
married
and
just
having
the
child
live
in
a
home
with
them
and
acknowledge
him.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
there’s
two
ways
of
doing
a
legitimizing.
one
before
notary
and
a
document
that
is
signed.
the
other
is
by
actions
of
the
parties
by
actually
being
married
and
acknowledging
informally
or
in
writing
that
the
child
is
theirs.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
yes
your
honor.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
the
father
did
not
legitimize
her
before
a
notary
public
and
he
did
not
marry
the
natural
mother
or
he
did
not
of
course
leave
a
will
or
adopt
the
child.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
no.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
to
my
understanding
is
they
do
both
or
if
the
--
only
the
husband
signs
the
acknowledgment,
it
is
not
binding
on
the
mother,
it's
only
binding
on
those
who
actually
acknowledge.
i’m
not
quite
sure
but
i
believe
either
one
could
acknowledge
but
it’s
only
binding
on
the
one
who
does.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
they
wouldn’t
had
to
say
that
they
acknowledged
that
--
ezra
vincent
would
have
had
to
say
that
he
was
the
father
of
this
child
and
that
he
acknowledged
the
child
as
his
child
and
granted
him
the
right
to
inherit
from
him,
it
has
to
be
specific.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
a
similar
to
a
will,
it
has
to
be
--
mr.
james
a.
leithead
well,
i’m
just
giving
you
those
in
my
words.
it
could
be
less
or
more
than
five
words
but
you
wouldn’t
have
to
express
his
intention
because
this
does
not
in
itself
express
his
intention
to
allow
the
child
to
inherit
from
him.
i
might
say
another
analogy
to
this
case
is
that
louisiana
code
prohibits
divorced
spouses
from
marrying
his
or
her
concubine.
now,
is
the
state
to
be
denied
this
policy
because
it
might
be
denied
of
persons
of
equal
protection
on
the
constitution.
i
see
my
time
is
running
out,
i’d
like
to
--
mr.
james
a.
leithead
louisiana
does
not
recognize
common
law
marriages
although
many
states
do
and
louisiana
and
other
states
have
different
laws
in
respect
to
putative
marriages.
mr.
james
a.
leithead
there’s
never
been
any
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
--
no
sir,
that
question
has
never
been
raised
in
louisiana.
whether
or
not
that
is
a
constitutional
problems
of
the
state
in
its
policy
decision,
whether
or
not,
not
to
recognize
common
law
marriages
and
to
require
that
people
married
and
living
together
should
go
through
a
ceremony.
that
question
has
never
been
risen.
but
if
would
be
risen,
would
arise
would
that
be
constitutional
for
the
state
to
pass
such
a
statute.
the
implications
of
this
case
are
maybe
far
reaching.
far
more
reaching
than
what
the
narrow
issues
that
are
presented
before
this
court,
once
this
court
decides
that
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
is
going
to
pass
upon
the
dissent
and
distribution
of
laws
in
the
50
state,
in
my
opinion,
the
court
would
have
to
legislate
on
many
items
and
make
decisions
and
decide
many
points
in
succession
law
which
will
be
most
complicated
for
instance.
in
this
particular,
in
louisiana,
these
are
some
of
the
things
the
court
would
have
to
decide
whether
or
not
an
illegitimate
child,
whether
the
illegitimate
child
would
inherit
from
its
father
equally
with
a
legitimate
child.
you
see,
this
makes
a
difference
because
in
louisiana,
we
have
the
forced
heirship
in
some
of
the
other
common
law
states,
it
may
not
make
any
difference.
will
and
adulteress
and
illegitimate
child
inherit
the
same
as
an
illegitimate
child
who
is
not
an
adulteress
illegitimate
child,
there
should
have
been
a
distinction
made.
will
an
illegitimate
child
who
is
informally
acknowledged
inherit
just
as
well
as
one
that
is
formally
acknowledged?
will
that
make
a
distinction
if
the
father
have
an
illegitimate
child
and
later
the
mother
and
the
father
married,
would
that
make
any
difference
as
to
the
rights
of
inheritance.
would
the
illegitimate
child
of
the
father
of
the
father’s
concubine
inherit
his
one
half
interest
in
the
community
property
of
the
father
with
his
legitimate
wife?
will
illegitimate
children
inherit
to
the
exclusion
of
the
decedent’s
parents
who
are
forced
heirs
if
there
are
no
other
children
or
would
the
illegitimate
child,
no
matter
how
it
would
be
acknowledged,
would
he
be
considered
a
forced
heir.
these
are
all
many
questions
that
would
have
to
be
answered
and
the
court
would
be
legislating
in
my
opinion,
if
they
would
attempt
to
decide
that
the
intestate
laws
in
this
--
that
are
before
this
court
for
decision
are
unconstitutional,
we
submit
that
the
court
below,
the
decision
of
the
court
below
should
be
affirmed.
