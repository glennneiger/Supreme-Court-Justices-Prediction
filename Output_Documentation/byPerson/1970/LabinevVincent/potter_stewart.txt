justice
potter
stewart
suppose
the
brothers
and
sisters
were
rather
aged
people
weren’t
they?
justice
potter
stewart
the
father
was
70,
her
father
who
acknowledged
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
this
child
was
his
child,
was
70-years
old
at
the
time
of
his
death?
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
suppose
some
at
least,
some
of
his
brothers
and
sisters
were
older
than
she
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
old
is
the
mother?
justice
potter
stewart
and
she
is
now,
she
is
now
married
mr.
labine?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
she
married
at
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
at
the
time
of
the
birth
of
this
child,
she
was
--
are
they
in
between
marriages?
justice
potter
stewart
she’s
never
been
married?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
and
very
well,
when
was
this
child
born?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see
she
was
a
widow?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that’s
true
everywhere,
isn’t
it?
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
was
that
a
first
amendment
case?
justice
potter
stewart
with
association
--
justice
potter
stewart
allow
me
to
answer
the
question
now
or
later?
justice
potter
stewart
i
would
suppose
perhaps
that
the
state
would
assume
an
intention
on
the
part
of
a
decedent
who
do
not
draw
a
will
that
his
property
should
go
under
the
state
laws
of
descendant
distribution?
the
father
of
this
child
could
have
drawn
a
will
and
left
all
of
his
property
to
the
child?
since
he
did
not
draw
a
will,
wouldn’t
the
natural
assumption
be
that
he
intended
his
property
to
go
by
the
louisiana
laws
of
descendant
distribution,
i.e.
to
his
brothers
and
sisters?
justice
potter
stewart
on
this
case
there
were
no
legitimate
children
of
the
decedent?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
in
this
case
with
respect
to
this
property
there
was
no
discrimination
as
among
these
children,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
no
children
got?
the
brothers
and
sisters
got
the
property?
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
no
discrimination
as
between
legitimate
children
and
illegitimate
children
of
this
decedent,
was
there?
justice
potter
stewart
two
quite
different
classes
of
people,
there
was
no
--
oh
i
think
you’ve
answered
my
question,
if
there
were
no
legitimate
children
then
there
was
no
discrimination
as
among
children
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
the
acknowledge
illegitimate
child
come
anywhere
in
the
hierarchy
if
there
had
been
--
justice
potter
stewart
if
this
decedent
had
died
living
no
surviving
brothers
and
sisters
and
no
issue
of
any
siblings,
would
this
appellant
have
inherited?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
wait
a
minute,
this
man
didn’t
have
mother,
father
and
a
wife?
justice
potter
stewart
oh
yes,
because
the
brother
as
in
this
case,
the
brothers
and
sisters
come
ahead
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
there
have
been
no
brothers
and
sisters,
the
appellant
would
have
inherited
here
under
the
--
intestate
succession
laws,
justice
potter
stewart
laws
of
descendant
distribution?
justice
potter
stewart
and
from
the
mother,
the
natural
mother
i
suppose
you
don’t
need
to
be
having
any
certification
of
parenthood
in
that
kind
of
--
and
for
the
mother,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
he
could
have
made
a
will
i
suppose
in
given
at
least
to
part
of
his
property
to
somebody
else.
justice
potter
stewart
you
can
give
them
2/3
of
the
property
still
to
his
brothers
and
sisters.
justice
potter
stewart
by
reason
of
the
certificate,
--
justice
potter
stewart
by
the
acknowledgment
that
he
was
the
father
of
the
child,
the
child
received
as
his
child?
justice
potter
stewart
social
security
and
veterans
benefits
totaling
a
$100.00
a
month
from
the
united
states
government
and
then
all
of
his
property
went
to
his
brothers
and
sisters?
justice
potter
stewart
there’s
no
way
of
knowing
that
that’s
not
exactly
what
he
intended?
justice
potter
stewart
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
justice
potter
stewart
the
acknowledgment
did
serve
to
make
her
illegible
to
receive
a
$100.00
a
month
from
the
united
states
government.
justice
potter
stewart
suppose
the

she

she

mr.
