justice
harry

as
you
move
along
your
argument,
will
you
touch
upon
the
question
whether
if
you
prevail
with
respect
to
this
little
child,
the
same
would
be
true
if
any
illegitimate
child
whether
acknowledged
or
not
if
paternity
were
established?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
or
draw
a
will?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
just
want
to
be
sure
that
your
due
process
argument
wouldn’t
carry
all
the
weight
to
benefit
any
other
illegitimate
child
once
paternity
was
established.
but
i
take
it
you’re
drawing
the
line
between
the
two.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
it
quite
accurate
to
say
the
father
did
what
he
could,
he
could
had
drawn
a
will?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
which
is
a
lot
easier
than
going
through
adoption
proceedings
or
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that’s
equal
protection
with
what,
with
what
other
children?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you’re
not
saying
that
louisiana
could
not
constitutionally
leave
all
children
legitimate
or
illegitimate
out
of
the
laws
of
intestacy,
or
are
you?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
come
back
to
the
question
i
originally
asked
and
i
realized
as
the
chief
justice
indicated
that
you
don’t
have
to
go
this
far
but
i
wonder
how
you
can
--
if
you
prevail
constitutionally
here,
you
don’t
also
carry
with
you
every
illegitimate
child
who’s
paternity
is
established
by
other
methods
than
acknowledgment,
i
would
suspect
you
do?
