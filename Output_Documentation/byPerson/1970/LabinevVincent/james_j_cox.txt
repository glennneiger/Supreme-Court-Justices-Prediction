mr.
james
j.
cox
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
equal
protection
rights
of
an
8-year-old
negro
girl
from
lake
charles
louisiana
who
was
the
daughter
of
the
decedent
ezra
vincent.
ezra
vincent
died
without
having
left
a
will
but
he
bequeathed
upon
his
child
a
formal
proof
of
the
child’s
ancestry
by
a
formal
active
acknowledgment
before
a
notary
public
which
was
recorded
in
the
division
of
public
health
statistics
along
with
the
child’s
birth
certificate
which
corroborated
proof
of
parentage
of
ezra
vincent
of
the
child
rita
nell
vincent.
mr.
james
j.
cox
as
rightly
said,
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
cox
does
not
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
i
think
this
is
the
crux
and
the
real
issue
of
the
case.
it’s
not
a
question
of
whether
or
not
of
a
state
as
was
so
aptly
put
in
justice
harlan’s
dissent
in
the
levy
and
glona
cases
has
the
right
to
require
a
formal
burden
of
proof
standards
or
criteria
which
are
meaningful
and
relevant
in
determining
the
question
of
the
state's
application
of
its
laws
but
in
this
case,
no
matter
what
burden
of
proof
is
met
by
this
particular
child,
because
of
the
fact
that
the
child
is
saddled
with
the
stigma
of
illegitimacy,
this
child
can
inherit
nothing
and
in
fact
as
what
in
effect
is
a
different
standard
of
requesting
support
from
the
decedent’s
state.
this
particular
child
had
much
better
proof
of
her
relationship
to
the
decedent
ezra
vincent
than
did
the
brothers
and
sisters
of
the
decedent
who
came
from
washington
dc
and
other
far
away
places
to
claim
the
decedent’s
estate
and
were
granted
the
decedent’s
estate
by
all
of
the
louisiana
courts.
these
brothers
and
sisters
could
produce
no
marriage
license
to
show
that
their
parents
were
married.
they
could
produce
no
birth
certificates
to
show
they
were
children
of
the
same
parent
as
the
decedent
ezra
vincent.
their
reputation
proof
was
extremely
sketchy.
none
of
the
witnesses
other
than
family
members,
the
brothers
and
sisters
themselves
could
recite
the
names
of
the
brothers
and
sisters
of
the
decedent
and
yet
the
louisiana
courts
because
of
its
faulty
burden
of
proof
situation
and
because
of
its
traditional
prejudice
against
illegitimates
rather
awarded
the
estate
to
the
brothers
and
sisters
than
to
the
little
child.
mr.
james
j.
cox
they
were
your
honor
and
in
fairness
--
mr.
james
j.
cox
yes.
mr.
james
j.
cox
yes
your
honor
but
that’s
not
beyond
the
--
mr.
james
j.
cox
in
fairness
justice
stewart,
i
would
say
that
records
were
not
kept
in
louisiana,
there
were
court
house
fires
and
other
reasons
why
it
was
difficult
to
prove
relationship
by
the
same
token
of
the
fact
of
burden
of
proof
and
the
fact
of
proof
of
relationship
is
extremely
significant
in
a
case
of
this
sort
because
it
goes
to
the
question
of
what
is
a
state's
legitimate
interest
in
legislating
against
a
particular
class
of
people.
mr.
james
j.
cox
the
mother
was
51-years
old.
mr.
james
j.
cox
mr.
labine
is
deceased
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
cox
she
was
married
to
james
brookes
and
then
she
married
mr.
labine
and
mr.
labine
is
now
deceased
and
she’s
unmarried.
she
is
also
the
mother
as
will
be
brought
out
i’m
sure
in
adverse
argument
of
other
illegitimate
children.
mr.
james
j.
cox
there
was
no
marriage
your
honor
at
the
time
of
the
birth
of
this
child.
mr.
james
j.
cox
she
had
been
married
first
to
mr.
brookes
and
then
to
mr.
labine
who
is
deceased.
mr.
james
j.
cox
this
child
was
born
after
the
death
of
mr.
labine.
mr.
james
j.
cox
yes
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
cox
no,
ezra
vincent
your
honor
was
not
married
nor
was
mrs.
labine,
there
was
no
disability.
mr.
james
j.
cox
mr.
justice
blackmun,
the
question
of
burden
of
proof
and
standards
of
proof
are
questions
which
would
be
more
appropriately
resolved
by
judicial
declarations
and
statutes,
statutes
from
the
stand
point
of
setting
reasonable
burdens
and
judicial
declarations
if
the
burdens
are
unreasonable.
here,
we
have
a
case
where
its
--
there’s
an
impossible
burden.
either
the
parents
of
the
child
would
have
had
to
marry
in
order
to
satisfy
the
statute
or
would
have
had
to
adopt
the
child
or
would
have
had
to
go
through
a
procedure
whereby
certain
(inaudible)
would
have
had
to
observed.
that
is,
they
would
have
had
to
state
it
in
the
declaration,
we
intend
to
legitimate
the
child.
mr.
james
j.
cox
or
draw
a
will.
on
the
other
hand,
the
state
in
our
contention
justice
blackmun
and
we
respectfully
submit
to
your
honor,
the
state
can’t
presume
a
discriminatory
intention
which
the
state
has
done
in
this
case.
in
fact,
the
state
of
louisiana
has
filed
an
amicus
curiae
brief
stating
that
illegitimate
children
are
the
proper
subjects
of
the
sort
of
legislation
and
inferring
that
robbers
can
be
classified,
why
cannot
be
illegitimates
be
classified
and
we
realize
that
--
mr.
james
j.
cox
as
a
matter
of
standing
before
the
court,
as
an
officer
of
the
court,
i
would
say
that
to
draw
the
line
a
formal
acknowledgment
would
be
perhaps
an
inappropriate
line.
the
uniform
probate
code
recommended
by
the
uniform
commissioners
on
state
laws,
recommends
that
any
child
shall
be
treated
as
legitimate
if
proof
of
paternity
is
established
during
the
lifetime
of
the
parent
or
the
father
or
thereafter
by
clear
and
convincing
proof.
ours
is
not
that
hard
a
case
although
i
think
that
this
perhaps
as
good
legislation.
ours
is
a
case
where
the
proof
of
paternity
is
so
clear
and
unequivocal
that
we
have
to
look
at
the
state’s
intentions
in
discriminating
against
the
child.
admittedly,
we
stand
before
this
honorable
court
asking
that
not
centuries
but
thousands
of
years
of
discrimination
against
illegitimates
be
set
aside,
but
this
court
has
never
hesitated
in
the
past
to
confront
issues
wherein
clear
and
convincing
proof
of
discrimination
against
the
particular
class
is
shown
no
matter
what
the
historical
antecedents
may
have
been.
in
fact,
in
levy
and
glona,
the
fact
of
discrimination
against
illegitimates
has
been
held
to
be
unconstitutional
in
the
context
of
wrongful
death
actions
which
involves
property
rights
as
well.
mr.
james
j.
cox
this
is
the
case
in
controversy
before
this
court.
mr.
james
j.
cox
only
in
order
to
answer
hypothetical
posed
by
your
honors
because
i
think
that
a
formal
acknowledgment
is
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
burden
of
proof
perhaps
other
clearing
convincing
modes
of
proof
would
satisfy
your
honors
also
or
the
courts
that
would
interpret
the
statutes.
mr.
james
j.
cox
no,
we’re
very
fortunate
in
that
respect
as
far
as
having
a
real
case
in
controversy
before
this
court.
mr.
james
j.
cox
in
one
of
the
amicus
curiae
briefs
various
--
mr.
james
j.
cox
--
differentiations
are
made
in
the
brief
of
the
american
civil
liberties
union
written
by
the
eminent
writer
in
the
field
primarily
professor
harry
d.
krause
joined
by
mr.
melvin
wolfe
and
mr.
dorson,
he
points
out
that
i
believe
in
perhaps
at
least
16
states,
if
i’m
not
mistaken
but
i
don’t
have
the
figures
before
me
your
honor.
under
various
conditions,
this
is
at
page
12
of
his
brief.
for
example
in
arizona,
california,
florida,
idaho,
and
i
do
know
your
honor
that
north
dakota
has
changed
this
law
as
a
result
of
the
in
re
estate
of
jensen
case
which
would
make
a
fifth
or
sixth
state
in
which
this
particular
case
would
not
–
needs
have
arisen
before
this
court.
in
re
estate
of
jensen,
in
the
state
of
north
dakota
after
the
levy
and
glona
cases,
the
north
dakota
supreme
court
rightly
applied
levy
and
glona
to
an
inheritance
case
and
said
that
the
north
dakota
statute
was
an
unconstitutional
discrimination
against
illegitimates
and
allowed
an
illegitimate
to
inherit.
not
only
did
this
illegitimate
child
not
inherit
her
father's
estate
but
the
louisiana
courts
felt
that
because
she
was
receiving
a
$100.00
per
month
in
social
security
and
va
benefits
that
she
was
not
entitled
to
support
because
of
the
standard
which
the
statute
establishes
for
support
for
an
illegitimate
which
is
to
prove
actual
necessity.
this
is
a
heavier
standard
and
a
recognized
child
has
to
establish.
the
child’s
needs
were
shown
to
be
a
$192.30
per
month,
but
because
of
the
fact
that
she
is
illegitimate,
she
must
continue
to
live
in
a
condition
of
destitution.
as
we
view
it
your
honors,
the
real
issue
in
this
case
is
the
denial
of
inheritance
rights
to
illegitimates,
promote
a
genuine
state
interest
in
family
unity
and
if
it
does
so
promote
it,
can
this
be
promoted
in
a
haphazard
fashion.
we
would
concede
that
family
unity
is
something
that
is
very
much
of
concern
to
states
and
something
which
to
be
well
promoted
for
instance,
the
state
of
louisiana
could
well
legislate
a
bonus
for
parents
who
remained
together
and
care
for
their
children.
to
the
contrary,
the
state
of
louisiana
has
passed
a
statute
legislating
against
parents
who
stay
together
for
welfare
purposes.
if
parents
remained
together
and
they
have
dependent
childrenintestate
succession
laws,
in
their
destitute,
they’re
ineligible
in
the
state
of
louisiana
for
welfare.
this
appears
in
louisiana
revised
statutes
46:231.
therefore,
louisiana
certainly
pursuing
the
most
peculiar
course
if
it’s
genuinely
trying
to
promote
family
unity
in
the
field
of
legitimate
relationships
between
parents
and
children.
furthermore,
--
mr.
james
j.
cox
yes
your
honor.
by
the
same
token,
some
states
in
applying
this
type
of
statute
have
tried
to
go
further
against
illegitimates
by
invoking
the
substitute
father
doctrine
which
is
that
if
there
were
an
illegitimate
father
in
a
household,
he
would
be
presumed
to
be
the
parent
of
all
of
the
children
therein
and
therefore
that
illegitimacy
situation
would
exclude
all
of
the
children
from
benefits.
now,
this
court
had
no
trouble
with
that
type
of
statute
in
arkansas.
in
smith
versus
king,
this
court
struck
this
down
as
a
denial
of
equal
protection
of
law
and
due
process
of
law.
furthermore,
if
the
state
of
louisiana
is
to
be
consistent
in
pursuing
the
doctrine
of
family
unity
and
promoting
legitimacy,
they
should
--
we
feel,
pay
some
attention
to
the
recent
statistics.
according
to
the
trends
in
illegitimacy
in
the
united
states
1940
to
1965
which
was
published
by
the
national
center
for
health
statistics
in
february
of
1968,
louisiana
had
more
illegitimate
births
per
capita
in
states
which
did
not
follow
this
particular
and
repressive
approach
to
illegitimacy.
mr.
james
j.
cox
well,
this
was
in
the
amicus
curiae
briefs
your
honor?
this
is
anticipating
an
argument
that
the
approach
to
promoting
family
unity
and
encouraging
legitimacy
is
based
on
common
sense.
mr.
james
j.
cox
well,
there
must
be
some
real
and
viable
relationship
between
the
declared
purpose
and
an
actual
state
of
facts
mr.
chief
justice
burger.
mr.
james
j.
cox
in
my
respectful
submission,
--
mr.
james
j.
cox
i
can’t
really
--
mr.
james
j.
cox
i
can’t
really
argue
with
that.
mr.
james
j.
cox
nobody
really
knows.
mr.
james
j.
cox
no,
i
don’t
think
that
pursuing
these
figures
we
will
come
out
with
an
answer
except
to
say
that
justice
stewart’s
observation
in
the
case
of
shelton
versus
tucker
i
think
is
pertinent.
this
court
in
that
case
pointed
out
that
even
though
the
governmental
purpose
might
be
legitimate,
in
this
case
perhaps
the
promotion
of
family
unity
by
legislating
in
a
field
of
legitimacy
this
purpose
might
be
legitimate.
but
that
purpose
can’t
be
pursued
by
means
that
stifle
individual
rights
and
that
are
over
broad
and
over
encompassing
for
--
mr.
james
j.
cox
yes
it
was
your
honor
but
--
mr.
james
j.
cox
--
i
do
believe
that
the
language
there
--
let
me
post
this
question
to
you
justice
stewart.
if
legislating
against
legitimacy
is
a
valid
purpose
which
we
concede
it
is,
would
it
not
be
over
broad
to
say
that
not
only
must
a
parent
formally
acknowledge
the
child
but
must
also
declare
that
he
intends
to
legitimate
the
child
in
order
to
accomplish
that
purpose.
mr.
james
j.
cox
well,
i’ll
sure
i’ll
receive
an
answer
but
this
is
what
strikes
me
to
be
the
question
here
from
the
standpoint
of
this
child’s
rights.
mr.
james
j.
cox
i
would
like
to
take
those
grounds
in
my
argument.
blackstone’s
commentaries
which
might
be
used
as
the
historical
president
to
show
that
this
is
not
an
unusual
bit
of
legislation,
specifically
mentions
the
reason
is
these
fraudulent
claims.
and
for
thousands
of
years
in
both
the
civil
and
common
law,
we
have
this
situation
but
with
an
over
broad
zealousness
and
diligence
in
pursuing
this
illegitimates
who
have
nothing
to
say
about
their
status.
here,
this
little
child
could
do
nothing
about
her
situation.
her
father
who
was
attempting
to
do
what
he
could
about
her
status
formally
acknowledged
her
and
adjoining
in
this
particular
approach,
we
feel
that
it’s
too
much
to
require
that
they
go
beyond
formal
acknowledgment.
mr.
james
j.
cox
he
could
have
--
mr.
james
j.
cox
he
could
have
justice
blackmun
but
it’s
every
man’s
right
not
to
draw
a
will
and
we
--
i
do
not
feel
speaking
for
the
little
child
and
not
engaging
in
colloquy
with
the
court,
that
this
child
should
have
any
heavier
burden
after
the
proof
of
her
relationship
to
her
parent
than
any
other
child
is
concerned.
the
state
presumes
an
intention
on
the
part
of
those
who
don’t
draw
wills
in
louisiana
to
exclude
illegitimates
and
this
is
an
unconstitutional
assumption
of
state
power
and
derogation
of
equal
protection
rights.
mr.
james
j.
cox
if
those
laws
were
constitutional,
i
would
imagine
that
the
man
in
the
streets
thinks
that
the
laws
are
constitutional
your
honor
from
talking
to
ordinary
people
and
that’s
not
before
this
court.
this
doesn’t
shock,
i
mean
idea
of
an
illegitimate
inheriting
if
he’s
formally
acknowledged
or
she
is
formally
acknowledged
seems
to
be
what
most
people
thinks
the
law
would
be
and
--
mr.
james
j.
cox
once
lawyers
know
what
this
honorable
court
holds
the
constitution
means,
when
it
says
equal
protection
of
the
law
which
most
people
think
they
know
then
the
attorneys
won’t
be
giving
advice
not
to
do
something
about
one
way
or
another.
if
you
want
to
exclude
your
illegitimate
child
which
you
can’t
do
by
the
way,
if
the
child
is
–
if
you
granted
equal
protection
in
louisiana,
the
child
would
receive
a
forced
portion.
mr.
james
j.
cox
with
children
similarly
situated
except
for
the
accident
of
what
their
parents
have
done.
mr.
james
j.
cox
that
would
be
--
this
has
never
been
done
in
any
state
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
i’m
not
saying
that
they
couldn’t
but
it
certainly
wouldn’t
promote
what
common
sense
dictates
that
is
the
parents
support
their
children
and
leave
basic
methods
of
support.
mr.
james
j.
cox
i
would
say
mr.
justice
blackmun
in
answer
to
that
question
that
it
would
depend
upon
the
way
that
this
court
rules.
i
don’t
believe
it
because
a
particular
standard
is
unconstitutional,
that
every
standard
under
other
circumstances
would
be
unconstitutional.
i
can
only
appear
before
this
honorable
court
with
a
case
in
which
a
clearly
unconstitutional
standard
has
been
placed
upon
a
child
under
which
equal
protection
has
been
denied
to
this
child.
mr.
james
j.
cox
there
were
no
legitimate
children.
mr.
james
j.
cox
there
was
discrimination
against
this
one
child.
mr.
james
j.
cox
that’s
right
and
there
was
--
mr.
james
j.
cox
there
was
discrimination
as
between
an
illegitimate
child
and
legitimate
brothers
and
sisters,
but
because
of
the
fact
--
mr.
james
j.
cox
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
cox
that’s
correct,
this
is
where
i
feel
the
discrimination
comes
in.
this
particular
child
was
discriminated
against
solely
because
this
child
was
illegitimate.
and
we
don’t
mean
to
go
as
far
as
the
briefs
that
were
filed
amicus
curiae
which
raised
the
question
of
racial
discrimination
here.
we
don’t
think
that
the
state
intends
racial
discrimination,
that
we
think
the
state
intends
a
discrimination
between
legitimates
and
illegitimates
which
is
a
class
of
discrimination
which
has
gone
on
for
centuries
in
which
has
been
en
route
--
have
been
made
in
other
cases.
but
when
it
comes
to
this
particular
child,
the
fact
that
others
in
other
states
and
the
supreme
courts
of
other
states
have
said
that
these
were
unconstitutional
enactments,
this
has
not
helped
this
child
because
our
supreme
court
says
it’s
perfectly
constitutional.
so
we’re
forced
in
a
position
of
having
to
ask
readdress
from
this
court.
i’d
like
to
save
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
james
j.
cox
this
would
be
a
good
and
valid
way
to
clear
the
problem
mr.
justice
black.
this
would
be
a
good
way
to
clear
up
the
problem
mr.
justice
black,
but
when
the
legislature
does
not
do
it,
--
mr.
james
j.
cox
admittedly
mr.
justice
black,
the
father
could
have
left
to
his
illegitimate
child
what
he
did
to
his
legitimate
brothers
and
sisters
but
we
get
into
the
area
of
presuming
the
intention
of
the
testator,
this
is
what
the
state
has
done,
the
legislature
has
presumed
that
all
testators
intend
to
exclude
illegitimates
but
the
legislature
also
presumes
and
has
said
that
a
parent
cannot
exclude
legitimate
children.
mr.
james
j.
cox
why
should
the
court
--
mr.
james
j.
cox
i
didn’t
understand
it.
mr.
james
j.
cox
that
step
may
very
well
come
because
the
father
cannot
discriminate
against
legitimate
children
in
louisiana.
why
should
the
father
be
able
to
discriminate
against
illegitimate
children?
that
we
have
a
forced
heirship
laws
in
louisiana
mr.
justice
black.
i
understand
your
philosophical
argument
but
the
state
of
louisiana
presumes
that
parents
have
to
provide
for
their
children
and
will
not
allow
discrimination
against
children.
mr.
james
j.
cox
that’s
correct
your
honor,
but
he
can
disinherit
his
illegitimate
children
by
not
saying
anything
and
he
doesn’t
intend
to.
mr.
james
j.
cox
yes
he
could
have
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
cox
he
could
have
made
a
will
and
he
could
have
left
his
property
to
his
illegitimate
child
if
he
had
so
desired.
mr.
james
j.
cox
he
had
none
so
he
could
not.
mr.
james
j.
cox
but
if
had
had
some,
no
he
could
not
have,
they
would
have
been
forced
to
the
same
extent.
there’s
a
small
disposable
portion
that
he
can
distribute
but
--
mr.
james
j.
cox
that’s
correct
your
honor.
i’d
like
to
save
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
cox
thank
you
very
much
mr.
chief
justice
burger.
i
think
that
at
the
outset
i
should
answer
the
most
important
question
raised
by
mr.
leithead
and
that
was
the
question
of
the
confusion
that
would
result
in
property
law
if
this
illegitimate
child
were
considered
to
be
a
child
of
the
decedent.
the
answer
is
that
if
this
court
ruled
that
as
it
has
in
levy
and
glona
that
is
invidious
to
discriminate
against
an
illegitimate
and
that
this
child
should
be
treated
as
a
legitimate
since
the
burden
of
proof
standard
has
been
met
here,
then
this
child
would
simply
inherit
like
any
other
child
and
his
relationship
vis-à-vis
the
parents
vis-à-vis
collateral
candid
would
be
just
like
any
other
child,
there
would
no
uncertainty
in
louisiana’s
property
laws
result
of
such
a
ruling.
it
was
cleared
up
in
north
dakota
by
the
north
dakota
supreme
court
by
stating
that
for
all
extents
and
purposes,
a
child
who
has
the
burden
of
proving
his
parentage
shall
be
treated
as
though
legitimate.
now,
i
think
that
the
other
question
that
is
the
chaos
that
might
be
created
in
land
titles.
mr.
james
j.
cox
oh,
the
court
of
north
dakota
and
in
re
estate
of
jensen,
based
it
on
the
grounds
of
the
north
dakota
constitution
and
the
united
states
constitution
granting
equal
protection
of
laws
to
all
of
its
citizens.
it’s
not
strictly
relevant
but
the
supreme
court
of
that
state
of
italy
under
its
post
war
constitution,
some
10
or
15
days
ago
according
to
an
ap
dispatch,
decided
that
in
italy,
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
under
the
post
war
constitution
demanded
that
a
child
who
bore
the
burden
of
proving
within
a
narrow
framework,
his
relationship
to
his
parent
could
inherit
just
like
a
legitimate
child
and
this
is
the
only
issue
this
before
this
court,
not
some
sort
of
disruption
of
the
orderly
legal
processes
of
the
nation.
simply,
the
granting
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws
within
a
narrow
framework,
to
children
who
have
nothing
to
say
except
through
this
court
about
their
status,
the
innocent
victims
of
discrimination,
levy
and
glona
are
the
laws
of
the
land
and
to
repudiate
levy
and
glona
because
of
the
fact
that
land
titles
might
be
involved
is
to
deny
to
a
particular
person
or
a
particular
case
or
controversy,
equal
justice
under
the
law.
now,
in
the
famous
case
of
moscrat
versus
united
states,
it
was
held
that
actual
cases
are
controversies
with
the
things
that
were
presented
to
the
court.
declaratory
judgments
about
other
people’s
rights
would
not
be
entered
upon
by
this
court.
n
us
versus
wade
and
gilbert
versus
california,
the
court
ruled
that
the
new
standards
which
were
basic
standards
of
due
process
and
those
cases,
that
is
the
right
of
an
accused
to
have
an
counsel
in
a
lineup
where
this
–
lead
to
prejudice
to
this
case,
would
be
applied
to
wade
and
gilbert
but
not
to
those
who
had
lived
before
wade
and
gilbert
or
who
had
transgressed
previously.
if
this
court
rules
in
favor
of
the
little
child
in
this
case,
it
would
apply
to
her
case
and
to
subsequent
cases
and
lawyers
will
have
ample
opportunity
to
make
their
wills
and
provide
under
the
laws
for
their
clients.
but
under
levy
and
glona,
this
child
is
entitled
to
the
most
profound
consideration
of
her
equal
protection
rights
by
this
honorable
court.
mr.
james
j.
cox
no
because,
here
we
have
a
question
of
class,
a
class
of
people
your
honor.
in
this
particular
case
we
have
a
class
of
people
illegitimates
just
like
a
class
of
people,
chinese
in
which
this
honorable
court
in
cases
has
said
that
in
an
alien
land
loss
cases,
said
we
couldn’t
discriminate
against
japanese.
mr.
james
j.
cox
i
see
no
reason.
mr.
james
j.
cox
i
see
no
reason
why
children
in
one
state
should
not
be
able
to
inherit
and
children
in
another
state
according
to
the
state’s
legislative
wisdom
can
inherit
only
if
their
parents
say
they
can
or
cannot,
but
i
do
see
something
invidious
in
one
state
saying
that
under
--
or
any
state
saying
that
a
--
that
japanese
as
was
this
case
in
oyama
versus
california,
that
the
child
of
an
alien
cannot
hold
property
because
it’s
presumed
to
be
the
alien’s
property
and
i
would
join
with
justice
black
who
wanted
to
go
further
and
say
that
not
only
could
that
child
hold
property
but
his
parents
should
be
able
to
hold
property.
this
is
a
discrimination
against
the
class
of
children
your
honor,
not
a
state
trying
to
carry
out
a
state
purpose.
mr.
james
j.
cox
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
equal
protection
rights
of
an
8-year-old
negro
girl
from
lake
charles
louisiana
who
was
the
daughter
of
the
decedent
ezra
vincent.
ezra
vincent
died
without
having
left
a
will
but
he
bequeathed
upon
his
child
a
formal
proof
of
the
child’s
ancestry
by
a
formal
active
acknowledgment
before
a
notary
public
which
was
recorded
in
the
division
of
public
health
statistics
along
with
the
child’s
birth
certificate
which
corroborated
proof
of
parentage
of
ezra
vincent
of
the
child
rita
nell
vincent.
mr.
james
j.
cox
as
rightly
said,
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
cox
does
not
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
i
think
this
is
the
crux
and
the
real
issue
of
the
case.
it’s
not
a
question
of
whether
or
not
of
a
state
as
was
so
aptly
put
in
justice
harlan’s
dissent
in
the
levy
and
glona
cases
has
the
right
to
require
a
formal
burden
of
proof
standards
or
criteria
which
are
meaningful
and
relevant
in
determining
the
question
of
the
state's
application
of
its
laws
but
in
this
case,
no
matter
what
burden
of
proof
is
met
by
this
particular
child,
because
of
the
fact
that
the
child
is
saddled
with
the
stigma
of
illegitimacy,
this
child
can
inherit
nothing
and
in
fact
as
what
in
effect
is
a
different
standard
of
requesting
support
from
the
decedent’s
state.
this
particular
child
had
much
better
proof
of
her
relationship
to
the
decedent
ezra
vincent
than
did
the
brothers
and
sisters
of
the
decedent
who
came
from
washington
dc
and
other
far
away
places
to
claim
the
decedent’s
estate
and
were
granted
the
decedent’s
estate
by
all
of
the
louisiana
courts.
these
brothers
and
sisters
could
produce
no
marriage
license
to
show
that
their
parents
were
married.
they
could
produce
no
birth
certificates
to
show
they
were
children
of
the
same
parent
as
the
decedent
ezra
vincent.
their
reputation
proof
was
extremely
sketchy.
none
of
the
witnesses
other
than
family
members,
the
brothers
and
sisters
themselves
could
recite
the
names
of
the
brothers
and
sisters
of
the
decedent
and
yet
the
louisiana
courts
because
of
its
faulty
burden
of
proof
situation
and
because
of
its
traditional
prejudice
against
illegitimates
rather
awarded
the
estate
to
the
brothers
and
sisters
than
to
the
little
child.
mr.
james
j.
cox
they
were
your
honor
and
in
fairness
--
mr.
james
j.
cox
yes.
mr.
james
j.
cox
yes
your
honor
but
that’s
not
beyond
the
--
mr.
james
j.
cox
in
fairness
justice
stewart,
i
would
say
that
records
were
not
kept
in
louisiana,
there
were
court
house
fires
and
other
reasons
why
it
was
difficult
to
prove
relationship
by
the
same
token
of
the
fact
of
burden
of
proof
and
the
fact
of
proof
of
relationship
is
extremely
significant
in
a
case
of
this
sort
because
it
goes
to
the
question
of
what
is
a
state's
legitimate
interest
in
legislating
against
a
particular
class
of
people.
mr.
james
j.
cox
the
mother
was
51-years
old.
mr.
james
j.
cox
mr.
labine
is
deceased
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
cox
she
was
married
to
james
brookes
and
then
she
married
mr.
labine
and
mr.
labine
is
now
deceased
and
she’s
unmarried.
she
is
also
the
mother
as
will
be
brought
out
i’m
sure
in
adverse
argument
of
other
illegitimate
children.
mr.
james
j.
cox
there
was
no
marriage
your
honor
at
the
time
of
the
birth
of
this
child.
mr.
james
j.
cox
she
had
been
married
first
to
mr.
brookes
and
then
to
mr.
labine
who
is
deceased.
mr.
james
j.
cox
this
child
was
born
after
the
death
of
mr.
labine.
mr.
james
j.
cox
yes
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
cox
no,
ezra
vincent
your
honor
was
not
married
nor
was
mrs.
labine,
there
was
no
disability.
mr.
james
j.
cox
mr.
justice
blackmun,
the
question
of
burden
of
proof
and
standards
of
proof
are
questions
which
would
be
more
appropriately
resolved
by
judicial
declarations
and
statutes,
statutes
from
the
stand
point
of
setting
reasonable
burdens
and
judicial
declarations
if
the
burdens
are
unreasonable.
here,
we
have
a
case
where
its
--
there’s
an
impossible
burden.
either
the
parents
of
the
child
would
have
had
to
marry
in
order
to
satisfy
the
statute
or
would
have
had
to
adopt
the
child
or
would
have
had
to
go
through
a
procedure
whereby
certain
(inaudible)
would
have
had
to
observed.
that
is,
they
would
have
had
to
state
it
in
the
declaration,
we
intend
to
legitimate
the
child.
mr.
james
j.
cox
or
draw
a
will.
on
the
other
hand,
the
state
in
our
contention
justice
blackmun
and
we
respectfully
submit
to
your
honor,
the
state
can’t
presume
a
discriminatory
intention
which
the
state
has
done
in
this
case.
in
fact,
the
state
of
louisiana
has
filed
an
amicus
curiae
brief
stating
that
illegitimate
children
are
the
proper
subjects
of
the
sort
of
legislation
and
inferring
that
robbers
can
be
classified,
why
cannot
be
illegitimates
be
classified
and
we
realize
that
--
mr.
james
j.
cox
as
a
matter
of
standing
before
the
court,
as
an
officer
of
the
court,
i
would
say
that
to
draw
the
line
a
formal
acknowledgment
would
be
perhaps
an
inappropriate
line.
the
uniform
probate
code
recommended
by
the
uniform
commissioners
on
state
laws,
recommends
that
any
child
shall
be
treated
as
legitimate
if
proof
of
paternity
is
established
during
the
lifetime
of
the
parent
or
the
father
or
thereafter
by
clear
and
convincing
proof.
ours
is
not
that
hard
a
case
although
i
think
that
this
perhaps
as
good
legislation.
ours
is
a
case
where
the
proof
of
paternity
is
so
clear
and
unequivocal
that
we
have
to
look
at
the
state’s
intentions
in
discriminating
against
the
child.
admittedly,
we
stand
before
this
honorable
court
asking
that
not
centuries
but
thousands
of
years
of
discrimination
against
illegitimates
be
set
aside,
but
this
court
has
never
hesitated
in
the
past
to
confront
issues
wherein
clear
and
convincing
proof
of
discrimination
against
the
particular
class
is
shown
no
matter
what
the
historical
antecedents
may
have
been.
in
fact,
in
levy
and
glona,
the
fact
of
discrimination
against
illegitimates
has
been
held
to
be
unconstitutional
in
the
context
of
wrongful
death
actions
which
involves
property
rights
as
well.
mr.
james
j.
cox
this
is
the
case
in
controversy
before
this
court.
mr.
james
j.
cox
only
in
order
to
answer
hypothetical
posed
by
your
honors
because
i
think
that
a
formal
acknowledgment
is
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
burden
of
proof
perhaps
other
clearing
convincing
modes
of
proof
would
satisfy
your
honors
also
or
the
courts
that
would
interpret
the
statutes.
mr.
james
j.
cox
no,
we’re
very
fortunate
in
that
respect
as
far
as
having
a
real
case
in
controversy
before
this
court.
mr.
james
j.
cox
in
one
of
the
amicus
curiae
briefs
various
--
mr.
james
j.
cox
--
differentiations
are
made
in
the
brief
of
the
american
civil
liberties
union
written
by
the
eminent
writer
in
the
field
primarily
professor
harry
d.
krause
joined
by
mr.

he

out
that

believe
in
perhaps
at
least
16
states,
if
i’m
not
mistaken
but
i
don’t
have
the
figures
before
me
your
honor.
under
various
conditions,
this
is
at
page
12
of
his
brief.
for
example
in
arizona,
california,
florida,
idaho,
and
i
do
know
your
honor
that
north
dakota
has
changed
this
law
as
a
result
of
the
in
re
estate
of
jensen
case
which
would
make
a
fifth
or
sixth
state
in
which
this
particular
case
would
not
–
needs
have
arisen
before
this
court.
in
re
estate
of
jensen,
in
the
state
of
north
dakota
after
the
levy
and
glona
cases,
the
north
dakota
supreme
court
rightly
applied
levy
and
glona
to
an
inheritance
case
and
said
that
the
north
dakota
statute
was
an
unconstitutional
discrimination
against
illegitimates
and
allowed
an
illegitimate
to
inherit.
not
only
did
this
illegitimate
child
not
inherit
her
father's
estate
but
the
louisiana
courts
felt
that
because
she
was
receiving
a
$100.00
per
month
in
social
security
and
va
benefits
that
she
was
not
entitled
to
support
because
of
the
standard
which
the
statute
establishes
for
support
for
an
illegitimate
which
is
to
prove
actual
necessity.
this
is
a
heavier
standard
and
a
recognized
child
has
to
establish.
the
child’s
needs
were
shown
to
be
a
$192.30
per
month,
but
because
of
the
fact
that
she
is
illegitimate,
she
must
continue
to
live
in
a
condition
of
destitution.
as
we
view
it
your
honors,
the
real
issue
in
this
case
is
the
denial
of
inheritance
rights
to
illegitimates,
promote
a
genuine
state
interest
in
family
unity
and
if
it
does
so
promote
it,
can
this
be
promoted
in
a
haphazard
fashion.
we
would
concede
that
family
unity
is
something
that
is
very
much
of
concern
to
states
and
something
which
to
be
well
promoted
for
instance,
the
state
of
louisiana
could
well
legislate
a
bonus
for
parents
who
remained
together
and
care
for
their
children.
to
the
contrary,
the
state
of
louisiana
has
passed
a
statute
legislating
against
parents
who
stay
together
for
welfare
purposes.
if
parents
remained
together
and
they
have
dependent
childrenintestate
succession
laws,
in
their
destitute,
they’re
ineligible
in
the
state
of
louisiana
for
welfare.
this
appears
in
louisiana
revised
statutes
46:231.
therefore,
louisiana
certainly
pursuing
the
most
peculiar
course
if
it’s
genuinely
trying
to
promote
family
unity
in
the
field
of
legitimate
relationships
between
parents
and
children.
furthermore,
--
mr.
james
j.
cox
yes
your
honor.
by
the
same
token,
some
states
in
applying
this
type
of
statute
have
tried
to
go
further
against
illegitimates
by
invoking
the
substitute
father
doctrine
which
is
that
if
there
were
an
illegitimate
father
in
a
household,
he
would
be
presumed
to
be
the
parent
of
all
of
the
children
therein
and
therefore
that
illegitimacy
situation
would
exclude
all
of
the
children
from
benefits.
now,
this
court
had
no
trouble
with
that
type
of
statute
in
arkansas.
in
smith
versus
king,
this
court
struck
this
down
as
a
denial
of
equal
protection
of
law
and
due
process
of
law.
furthermore,
if
the
state
of
louisiana
is
to
be
consistent
in
pursuing
the
doctrine
of
family
unity
and
promoting
legitimacy,
they
should
--
we
feel,
pay
some
attention
to
the
recent
statistics.
according
to
the
trends
in
illegitimacy
in
the
united
states
1940
to
1965
which
was
published
by
the
national
center
for
health
statistics
in
february
of
1968,
louisiana
had
more
illegitimate
births
per
capita
in
states
which
did
not
follow
this
particular
and
repressive
approach
to
illegitimacy.
mr.
james
j.
cox
well,
this
was
in
the
amicus
curiae
briefs
your
honor?
this
is
anticipating
an
argument
that
the
approach
to
promoting
family
unity
and
encouraging
legitimacy
is
based
on
common
sense.
mr.
james
j.
cox
well,
there
must
be
some
real
and
viable
relationship
between
the
declared
purpose
and
an
actual
state
of
facts
mr.
chief
justice
burger.
mr.
james
j.
cox
in
my
respectful
submission,
--
mr.
james
j.
cox
i
can’t
really
--
mr.
james
j.
cox
i
can’t
really
argue
with
that.
mr.
james
j.
cox
nobody
really
knows.
mr.
james
j.
cox
no,
i
don’t
think
that
pursuing
these
figures
we
will
come
out
with
an
answer
except
to
say
that
justice
stewart’s
observation
in
the
case
of
shelton
versus
tucker
i
think
is
pertinent.
this
court
in
that
case
pointed
out
that
even
though
the
governmental
purpose
might
be
legitimate,
in
this
case
perhaps
the
promotion
of
family
unity
by
legislating
in
a
field
of
legitimacy
this
purpose
might
be
legitimate.
but
that
purpose
can’t
be
pursued
by
means
that
stifle
individual
rights
and
that
are
over
broad
and
over
encompassing
for
--
mr.
james
j.
cox
yes
it
was
your
honor
but
--
mr.
james
j.
cox
--
i
do
believe
that
the
language
there
--
let
me
post
this
question
to
you
justice
stewart.
if
legislating
against
legitimacy
is
a
valid
purpose
which
we
concede
it
is,
would
it
not
be
over
broad
to
say
that
not
only
must
a
parent
formally
acknowledge
the
child
but
must
also
declare
that
he
intends
to
legitimate
the
child
in
order
to
accomplish
that
purpose.
mr.
james
j.
cox
well,
i’ll
sure
i’ll
receive
an
answer
but
this
is
what
strikes
me
to
be
the
question
here
from
the
standpoint
of
this
child’s
rights.
mr.
james
j.
cox
i
would
like
to
take
those
grounds
in
my
argument.
blackstone’s
commentaries
which
might
be
used
as
the
historical
president
to
show
that
this
is
not
an
unusual
bit
of
legislation,
specifically
mentions
the
reason
is
these
fraudulent
claims.
and
for
thousands
of
years
in
both
the
civil
and
common
law,
we
have
this
situation
but
with
an
over
broad
zealousness
and
diligence
in
pursuing
this
illegitimates
who
have
nothing
to
say
about
their
status.
here,
this
little
child
could
do
nothing
about
her
situation.
her
father
who
was
attempting
to
do
what
he
could
about
her
status
formally
acknowledged
her
and
adjoining
in
this
particular
approach,
we
feel
that
it’s
too
much
to
require
that
they
go
beyond
formal
acknowledgment.
mr.
james
j.
cox
he
could
have
--
mr.
james
j.
cox
he
could
have
justice
blackmun
but
it’s
every
man’s
right
not
to
draw
a
will
and
we
--
i
do
not
feel
speaking
for
the
little
child
and
not
engaging
in
colloquy
with
the
court,
that
this
child
should
have
any
heavier
burden
after
the
proof
of
her
relationship
to
her
parent
than
any
other
child
is
concerned.
the
state
presumes
an
intention
on
the
part
of
those
who
don’t
draw
wills
in
louisiana
to
exclude
illegitimates
and
this
is
an
unconstitutional
assumption
of
state
power
and
derogation
of
equal
protection
rights.
mr.
james
j.
cox
if
those
laws
were
constitutional,
i
would
imagine
that
the
man
in
the
streets
thinks
that
the
laws
are
constitutional
your
honor
from
talking
to
ordinary
people
and
that’s
not
before
this
court.
this
doesn’t
shock,
i
mean
idea
of
an
illegitimate
inheriting
if
he’s
formally
acknowledged
or
she
is
formally
acknowledged
seems
to
be
what
most
people
thinks
the
law
would
be
and
--
mr.
james
j.
cox
once
lawyers
know
what
this
honorable
court
holds
the
constitution
means,
when
it
says
equal
protection
of
the
law
which
most
people
think
they
know
then
the
attorneys
won’t
be
giving
advice
not
to
do
something
about
one
way
or
another.
if
you
want
to
exclude
your
illegitimate
child
which
you
can’t
do
by
the
way,
if
the
child
is
–
if
you
granted
equal
protection
in
louisiana,
the
child
would
receive
a
forced
portion.
mr.
james
j.
cox
with
children
similarly
situated
except
for
the
accident
of
what
their
parents
have
done.
mr.
james
j.
cox
that
would
be
--
this
has
never
been
done
in
any
state
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
i’m
not
saying
that
they
couldn’t
but
it
certainly
wouldn’t
promote
what
common
sense
dictates
that
is
the
parents
support
their
children
and
leave
basic
methods
of
support.
mr.
james
j.
cox
i
would
say
mr.
justice
blackmun
in
answer
to
that
question
that
it
would
depend
upon
the
way
that
this
court
rules.
i
don’t
believe
it
because
a
particular
standard
is
unconstitutional,
that
every
standard
under
other
circumstances
would
be
unconstitutional.
i
can
only
appear
before
this
honorable
court
with
a
case
in
which
a
clearly
unconstitutional
standard
has
been
placed
upon
a
child
under
which
equal
protection
has
been
denied
to
this
child.
mr.
james
j.
cox
there
were
no
legitimate
children.
mr.
james
j.
cox
there
was
discrimination
against
this
one
child.
mr.
james
j.
cox
that’s
right
and
there
was
--
mr.
james
j.
cox
there
was
discrimination
as
between
an
illegitimate
child
and
legitimate
brothers
and
sisters,
but
because
of
the
fact
--
mr.
james
j.
cox
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
cox
that’s
correct,
this
is
where
i
feel
the
discrimination
comes
in.
this
particular
child
was
discriminated
against
solely
because
this
child
was
illegitimate.
and
we
don’t
mean
to
go
as
far
as
the
briefs
that
were
filed
amicus
curiae
which
raised
the
question
of
racial
discrimination
here.
we
don’t
think
that
the
state
intends
racial
discrimination,
that
we
think
the
state
intends
a
discrimination
between
legitimates
and
illegitimates
which
is
a
class
of
discrimination
which
has
gone
on
for
centuries
in
which
has
been
en
route
--
have
been
made
in
other
cases.
but
when
it
comes
to
this
particular
child,
the
fact
that
others
in
other
states
and
the
supreme
courts
of
other
states
have
said
that
these
were
unconstitutional
enactments,
this
has
not
helped
this
child
because
our
supreme
court
says
it’s
perfectly
constitutional.
so
we’re
forced
in
a
position
of
having
to
ask
readdress
from
this
court.
i’d
like
to
save
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
james
j.
cox
this
would
be
a
good
and
valid
way
to
clear
the
problem
mr.
justice
black.
this
would
be
a
good
way
to
clear
up
the
problem
mr.
justice
black,
but
when
the
legislature
does
not
do
it,
--
mr.
james
j.
cox
admittedly
mr.
justice
black,
the
father
could
have
left
to
his
illegitimate
child
what
he
did
to
his
legitimate
brothers
and
sisters
but
we
get
into
the
area
of
presuming
the
intention
of
the
testator,
this
is
what
the
state
has
done,
the
legislature
has
presumed
that
all
testators
intend
to
exclude
illegitimates
but
the
legislature
also
presumes
and
has
said
that
a
parent
cannot
exclude
legitimate
children.
mr.
james
j.
cox
why
should
the
court
--
mr.
james
j.
cox
i
didn’t
understand
it.
mr.
james
j.
cox
that
step
may
very
well
come
because
the
father
cannot
discriminate
against
legitimate
children
in
louisiana.
why
should
the
father
be
able
to
discriminate
against
illegitimate
children?
that
we
have
a
forced
heirship
laws
in
louisiana
mr.
justice
black.
i
understand
your
philosophical
argument
but
the
state
of
louisiana
presumes
that
parents
have
to
provide
for
their
children
and
will
not
allow
discrimination
against
children.
mr.
james
j.
cox
that’s
correct
your
honor,
but
he
can
disinherit
his
illegitimate
children
by
not
saying
anything
and
he
doesn’t
intend
to.
mr.
james
j.
cox
yes
he
could
have
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
cox
he
could
have
made
a
will
and
he
could
have
left
his
property
to
his
illegitimate
child
if
he
had
so
desired.
mr.
james
j.
cox
he
had
none
so
he
could
not.
mr.
james
j.
cox
but
if
had
had
some,
no
he
could
not
have,
they
would
have
been
forced
to
the
same
extent.
there’s
a
small
disposable
portion
that
he
can
distribute
but
--
mr.
james
j.
cox
that’s
correct
your
honor.
i’d
like
to
save
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
cox
thank
you
very
much
mr.
chief
justice
burger.
i
think
that
at
the
outset
i
should
answer
the
most
important
question
raised
by
mr.
leithead
and
that
was
the
question
of
the
confusion
that
would
result
in
property
law
if
this
illegitimate
child
were
considered
to
be
a
child
of
the
decedent.
the
answer
is
that
if
this
court
ruled
that
as
it
has
in
levy
and
glona
that
is
invidious
to
discriminate
against
an
illegitimate
and
that
this
child
should
be
treated
as
a
legitimate
since
the
burden
of
proof
standard
has
been
met
here,
then
this
child
would
simply
inherit
like
any
other
child
and
his
relationship
vis-à-vis
the
parents
vis-à-vis
collateral
candid
would
be
just
like
any
other
child,
there
would
no
uncertainty
in
louisiana’s
property
laws
result
of
such
a
ruling.
it
was
cleared
up
in
north
dakota
by
the
north
dakota
supreme
court
by
stating
that
for
all
extents
and
purposes,
a
child
who
has
the
burden
of
proving
his
parentage
shall
be
treated
as
though
legitimate.
now,
i
think
that
the
other
question
that
is
the
chaos
that
might
be
created
in
land
titles.
mr.
james
j.
cox
oh,
the
court
of
north
dakota
and
in
re
estate
of
jensen,
based
it
on
the
grounds
of
the
north
dakota
constitution
and
the
united
states
constitution
granting
equal
protection
of
laws
to
all
of
its
citizens.
it’s
not
strictly
relevant
but
the
supreme
court
of
that
state
of
italy
under
its
post
war
constitution,
some
10
or
15
days
ago
according
to
an
ap
dispatch,
decided
that
in
italy,
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
under
the
post
war
constitution
demanded
that
a
child
who
bore
the
burden
of
proving
within
a
narrow
framework,
his
relationship
to
his
parent
could
inherit
just
like
a
legitimate
child
and
this
is
the
only
issue
this
before
this
court,
not
some
sort
of
disruption
of
the
orderly
legal
processes
of
the
nation.
simply,
the
granting
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws
within
a
narrow
framework,
to
children
who
have
nothing
to
say
except
through
this
court
about
their
status,
the
innocent
victims
of
discrimination,
levy
and
glona
are
the
laws
of
the
land
and
to
repudiate
levy
and
glona
because
of
the
fact
that
land
titles
might
be
involved
is
to
deny
to
a
particular
person
or
a
particular
case
or
controversy,
equal
justice
under
the
law.
now,
in
the
famous
case
of
moscrat
versus
united
states,
it
was
held
that
actual
cases
are
controversies
with
the
things
that
were
presented
to
the
court.
declaratory
judgments
about
other
people’s
rights
would
not
be
entered
upon
by
this
court.
n
us
versus
wade
and
gilbert
versus
california,
the
court
ruled
that
the
new
standards
which
were
basic
standards
of
due
process
and
those
cases,
that
is
the
right
of
an
accused
to
have
an
counsel
in
a
lineup
where
this
–
lead
to
prejudice
to
this
case,
would
be
applied
to
wade
and
gilbert
but
not
to
those
who
had
lived
before
wade
and
gilbert
or
who
had
transgressed
previously.
if
this
court
rules
in
favor
of
the
little
child
in
this
case,
it
would
apply
to
her
case
and
to
subsequent
cases
and
lawyers
will
have
ample
opportunity
to
make
their
wills
and
provide
under
the
laws
for
their
clients.
but
under
levy
and
glona,
this
child
is
entitled
to
the
most
profound
consideration
of
her
equal
protection
rights
by
this
honorable
court.
mr.
james
j.
cox
no
because,
here
we
have
a
question
of
class,
a
class
of
people
your
honor.
in
this
particular
case
we
have
a
class
of
people
illegitimates
just
like
a
class
of
people,
chinese
in
which
this
honorable
court
in
cases
has
said
that
in
an
alien
land
loss
cases,
said
we
couldn’t
discriminate
against
japanese.
mr.

i
see
no

mr.
james
j.
cox
i
see
no
reason
why
children
in
one
state
should
not
be
able
to
inherit
and
children
in
another
state
according
to
the
state’s
legislative
wisdom
can
inherit
only
if
their
parents
say
they
can
or
cannot,
but
i
do
see
something
invidious
in
one
state
saying
that
under
--
or
any
state
saying
that
a
--
that
japanese
as
was
this
case
in
oyama
versus
california,
that
the
child
of
an
alien
cannot
hold
property
because
it’s
presumed
to
be
the
alien’s
property
and
i
would
join
with
justice
black
who
wanted
to
go
further
and
say
that
not
only
could
that
child
hold
property
but
his
parents
should
be
able
to
hold
property.
this
is
a
discrimination
against
the
class
of
children
your
honor,
not
a
state
trying
to
carry
out
a
state
purpose.
