what
if
this
plaintiffs
disposition
had
been
legitimate,
she
would
have
automatically
inherited,
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what’s
your
reason
for
drawing
the
line
between
the
legitimate
and
illegitimate
children
insofar
as
the
mother
is
concerned?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
a
closed
family
connection
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
between
the
illegitimate
child
and
legitimate
child?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
to
promote
the
marriage
of
the
illegitimate
child
or
his
mother
but
the
illegitimate
child
is
the
one
to
suffer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
course
of
events
can
the
child
change?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
what
i
thought.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
the
child
had
been
legitimate,
it
hadn’t
seen
the
father
for
the
past
50
years
and
was
now
living
alone,
she
would
have
inherited?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
indicates
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
may
i,
does
the
record
show
how
much
of
estate
this
man
left?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
the
case,
could
have
this
man
alone
could
have
adopted
this
child?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
louisiana.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
he
would
meet
the
same
category
for
legitimate
child.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that
if
an
illegitimate
child
is
born
to
a
couple
who
has
no
access
to
legal
advice
or
adoption,
had
no
way
in
the
world
for
that
child
to
become
able
to
inherit?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
not
to
inheritance?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
means
adopted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
i
said
the
child
has
to
be
adopted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
is
legitimated?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that’s
under
louisiana
law?
justice
thurgood
marshall
at
the
court
notary.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
legitimizing
is
done
before
notary?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
has
to
be
done
before
notary
and
in
louisiana
that’s
different
from
notaries
in
the
other
countries,
that’s
officially
banned.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
that’s
the
only
way
to
do
it,
the
only
difference
between
that
child
in
this
case,
the
only
reason
she
can’t
inherit
because
they
differ
as
far
as
willing
to
do
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
none
of
this
things
could
she
on
her
own
had
done
obviously?
