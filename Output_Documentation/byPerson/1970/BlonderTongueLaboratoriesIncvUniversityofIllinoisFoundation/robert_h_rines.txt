mr.
robert
h.
rines
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
to
take
one
moment
to
introduce
my
father,
teacher,
and
partner
mr.
david
rines,
my
co-counsel
from
chicago,
mr.
richard
phillips.
this
case
involves
a
conflict
of
decisions
between
the
eighth
circuit
and
the
seventh
circuit
with
regard
to
the
validity
of
a
patent
to
isbell
dealing
with
television
antennas,
the
type
that
i'm
sure,
your
honors
have
seen
cluttering
our
landscape
on
the
roofs
of
houses
which
are
very
necessary
in
order
to
get
good
television
reception
in
the
homes.
i
have
here
typical
antenna
of
the
type
i'm
sure
you’ve
seen
on
the
roofs,
involving
what
we
call
dipoles,
nothing
magical
about
that,
just
little
rods
which
are
tuned
and
corrected
in
terms
to
dimensions
and
direction
to
receive
from
the
television
transmitting
stations
the
signals
that
we
tune
into
our
television.
in
the
eighth
circuit,
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
the
isbell
patent
which
is
owned
by
the
university
of
illinois
foundation
to
be
invalid
for
obviousness
in
the
light
of
the
teaching
of
the
prior
art.
the
university
of
illinois
foundation
filed
not
just
one
suit,
in
the
winegard
case
which
is
at
eighth
circuit
case,
but
filed
the
suit
against
blonder-tongue,
a
new
jersey
corporation
in
chicago
by
suing
a
customer
and
joining
blonder-tongue
and
a
whole
host
of
other
manufacturers
throughout
the
land.
when
a
decision
went
against
them
in
the
winegard
district
court
and
while
they
were
appealing
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
eighth
circuit,
the
university
of
illinois
foundation
pursued
the
suit
against
blonder-tongue
in
new
jersey,
on
exactly
the
same
patent,
there
was
also
another
patent
involved
and
we
went
to
trial
before
a
judge
hoffman.
one
of
the
issues
in
our
presentation
is
the
fact
that
we
were
forced
to
this
trial
without
the
benefit
of
a
single
witness
during
the
whole
presentation
of
the
university
of
illinois'
case
in-chief.
as
a
result
of
the
fact
that
when
we
were
ready
in
december
18th,
the
trial
date
with
our
cambridge,
massachusetts
expert
who’d
worked
over
a
year
on
this
with
us,
with
mr.
blonder,
and
various
customer
witnesses
from
all
over
the
country
and
myself
in
boston,
the
judge
could
not
hear
it
on
the
18th
and
he
couldn’t
set
a
time
for
postponement,
19th,
20th
and
21st,
we
still
didn’t
have
a
trial
date.
the
result
was
that
the
day
before
christmas
the
trial
was
set
for
two
days
after
christmas
and
i
was
not
able
to
reassemble
any
of
my
witnesses
and
the
district
court
refused
to
give
me
a
few
days
in
which
to
this
but
forced
us
to
go
to
trial
without
any
witnesses
at
all.
therefore,
we
were
not
able
to
produce
any
live
witnesses
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
isbell
patent
was
or
was
not
valid
for
our
business
or
any
other
reason.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
it
had
been
set
several
times,
but
then
was
postponed
mr.
justice
potter,
until
december
18th.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
the
prior
trial
of
judge
hoffman
had
not
been
finished.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
a
prior
trial
of
the
district
court
had
had
not
been
finished,
so
it
was
postponed
to
december
18th.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
oh!
no,
there
were
several
during,
at
the
request
of
the
parties,
at
the
request
of
the
court,
this
is
about
six
or
seven
postponement,
but
we’re
all
zero
it
in
for
december
18th,
we
were
all
there.
therefore,
the
record
that
has
been
produced
in
this
case
is
only
the
documents
that
we
were
able
to
put
in
before
judge
hoffman
which
were
the
same
documents
before
the
district
court
in
the
eighth
circuit
litigation,
the
winegard
litigation
and
we
had
to
argue
therefore
from
those
documents
without
the
benefit
of
any
expert
or
any
witnesses
at
all,
these
issues
of
obviousness
and
validity.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
yes,
there
was.
the
other
side,
the
defendant
had
a
right
and
did
produce
an
expert
and
the
court
--
mr.
robert
h.
rines
wasn’t
in
that.
no,
i'm
a
different
defendant.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
yes
he
did
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
so
the
issue
squarely
before
this
court
is
who
was
right
in
terms
to
this
conclusion
of
obviousness
on
substantially
the
same
record,
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
eighth
circuit
or
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
seventh
circuit?
and
under
the
doctrine
of
triplett
v.
lowell,
to
which
we
will
address
ourselves
also,
if
you
recall,
when
a
conflict
does
arise
because
a
patentee
has
a
second
bite
of
the
pie,
if
he
loses
in
a
first
circuit,
the
decision
must
rest
with
this
supreme
court
as
to
whether
the
patent
is
valid
or
invalid.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
so
far
as
the
documents
are
concerned
--
mr.
robert
h.
rines
yes.
but
he
had
more
evidence
in
the
eighth
circuit
because
they
have
live
witnesses
and
experts
which
we
were
not
able
to
produce
before
judge
hoffman.
so,
a
fuller
trial
was
held
in
the
eighth
circuit
than
we
have
in
the
seventh
circuit.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
no,
it
is
not
mr.
chief
justice.
in
addition,
in
--
mr.
robert
h.
rines
no,
i'm
not.
i
maintain
that
my
brother
here
did
have
a
right
if
there
was
a
genuine
new
issue
or
some
other
interpretations
of
a
claim
or
some
interpretation
of
law
in
another
circuit
as
different
in
this
circuit,
he
had
a
right
to
try
under
triplett
v.
lowell
in
another
circuit.
but
in
this
particular
case
where
we’re
stuck
with
substantially
the
same
documentary
evidence,
where
we
were
not
able
to
produce
even
that
modicum
of
expert
testimony
that
existed
in
the
eighth
circuit,
we
think
there
may
be
as
suggested
by
the
solicitor
general
some
reason
for
modification
of
that
doctrine
in
a
case
such
as
this.
the
real
question
that
is
before
this
court
is
on
the
matter
of
obviousness
at
the
time
that
mr.
isbell
made
his
invention,
what
was
the
knowledge
in
the
art?
what
was
the
skill
of
the
ordinary
mechanic?
what
have
been
known?
and
we
were
very
fortunate
that
one
distinction
between
these
two
trials
was
that
the
university
of
illinois
at
this
time
in
blonder-tongue
case
chose
to
take
in
some
prior
investigators
in
this
field
namely
dr.
duhamel,
who
had
pioneered
this
kind
of
antenna
at
the
university
of
illinois
many
years
before.
so
he
was
produced
as
a
plaintiff’s
witness
and
fortunately
through
cross-examination,
we
were
able
to
get
from
mr.
duhamel,
admissions
that
we
think
bolsters
this
concept
of
complete
and
obviousness
of
this
invention
at
the
time
that
mr.
isbell
made
it.
now
the
district
--
mr.
robert
h.
rines
it
is
not
for
the
edification
of
the
court.
there
were
two
patents
sued
on
by
the
university
of
illinois.
one
was
the
isbell
patent,
which
is
this
kind
of
an
antenna
not
this
where
these
rods
here
instead
of
being
off
at
an
angle,
come
out
straight,
that’s
isbell.
then
they
had
a
second
patent
the
mayes
who
just
took
these
rods
and
bent
them
in
this
way
into
a
“v.”
the
district
court
found
both
of
those
patents
valid.
the
court
of
appeals
threw
out
the
“v”
patent
saying
it
wasn’t
invalid.
so
that's
not
an
issue
in
the
supreme
court,
it
has
not
been
appealed.
however,
one
issue
that
is
involved
is
that
at
the
time
that
they
obtained
this
mayes
patent
in
the
patent
office,
counsel
who
were
prosecuting
both
the
isbell
and
mayes
patents
together
filed
an
affidavit
in
the
patent
office
which
we
maintain
was
fraudulent
as
a
result
of
which
this
mayes
patent
issue.
that
affidavit
concerned
both
inventions,
both
isbell
patent
and
the
mayes
patent
inventions
and
one
of
our
contentions
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
having
reversed
judge
hoffman
and
find
that
this
affidavit
was
less
than
candid
and
that
it
was
deliberately
given
to
mislead
the
patent
office
that
one
of
the
questions
we
raised
is
whether
under
those
circumstances,
there
should
be
any
standing
in
equity
on
either
patents
for
the
plaintiff.
and
also
involved
in
our
case
is
the
fact
that
the
minute,
the
fruits
of
this
fraud
were
obtained,
out
in
the
market
place
they
went
with
copious
advertisements
telling
the
whole
world
they
invented
the
broad
log
periodic
antenna,
nobody
else
could
make
one
and
this
coupled
with
a
whole
series
of
other
acts
almost
put
our
client
out
of
a
business.
so
that
we
have
a
counterclaim
which
is
in
point
2,
if
you
will,
question
number
4
now
before
this
court
as
to
whether
this
is
fair
competition
and
whether
this
is
not
violative
of
the
antitrust
laws
to
take
the
fruits
of
an
illegally
obtained
patent
and
use
it
the
way
it
was
used
in
the
marketplace
to
suppress
competition.
turning
back
for
the
moment
to
the
obviousness
of
the
isbell
patent,
at
the
time
that
isbell
made
his
invention,
this
whole
magic
of
log
periodicity
had
been
invented
long
since
as
judge
hoffman
found,
in
the
early
1950’s,
at
the
university
of
illinois.
it’s
very
simple.
what
it
means
is
that
in
order
to
have
your
television
antenna,
listen
to
all
of
the
channels
from
the
low
frequencies
to
the
high
frequencies,
we
pit
in
a
whole
bunch
of
these
antennas
and
we
tuned
them
to
different
frequencies
and
if
you
shape
them
in
the
way
that
they
go
from
the
long
wavelengths,
down
to
the
short
wavelengths,
just
taper
the
shape,
that’s
a
log-width
variation,
that’s
all
it
means
and
if
you
space
it
also
in
accordance
with
the
length
that
again
is
a
log-width
in
variation.
those
principles
and
that
discovery,
we
all
admit
was
known
before
isbell
came
into
the
scene.
what
then
that
isbell
claim
was
his
invention?
“uh-huh,”
he
said,
other
people
while
they
have
done
that
variation
of
having
long
shorter,
shorter,
shorter,
shorter,
shorter,
while
they
have
done
that
before,
they
didn’t
do
with
the
simple
single
wire.
they
did
it
of
what
he
calls
“teeth.”
you
see
this
a
little
a
triangular
teeth
and
they
didn’t
take
and
just
use
one
wire
instead
of
the
tooth.
so
this
is
supposedly
what
mr.
isbell
invented,
but
when
mr.
harris,
their
expert
got
on
the
stand,
he
admitted
to
us
as
shown
in
the
record
here
that
the
ideas
of
these
teeth
or
straight
lines,
or
folded
lines,
these
were
all
well-known
dipoles,
all
well-known
antennas
and
in
fact,
they
all
operate
the
same
way
to
produce
the
same
result.
i
would
like
to
hold
up
for
you
from
appendix,
volume
2,
if
i
may,
page
475,
the
sketches
that
their
witness,
mr.
harris
put
on
the
board
and
which
we
transcribed
on
the
paper,
475
and
476
where
he
shows,
if
your
honors
please,
first,
the
straight
lines,
that’s
the
straight
line
dipoles
so-called
of
isbell.
and
up
above
what
he
shows
what
the
current
is,
this
loop
dash
line,
that
means
the
radio
currents
go
across
the
antenna
in
that
kind
of
a
distribution.
then
on
the
next
page,
mr.
harris,
their
expert,
sketches
these
triangular
loops
such
as
i
showed
you
in
items
6
and
he
shows
the
same
current
distribution.
and
below
that
he
shows
that
you
could
fold
the
wire
into
a
rectangular
loop
and
get
the
same
current
distribution.
and
there's
no
dispute
but
that
all
of
these
antennas
were
known
long
before
isbell,
decades.
so,
that
the
question
resolves
itself
into,
can
you
give
us
many
patents
as
there
are
well-known
types
of
antenna
shapes
by
just
magically
putting
them
in
this
whole
formula
for
log
periodicity?
and
this
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
eighth
circuit
found
to
answer
in
a
negative,
but
this
is
what
judge
hoffman
answered
in
the
affirmative.
now,
why?
judge
hoffman
was
impressed
by
mr.
duhamel’s
testimony
that
he
was
surprised
that
these
straight
line
elements
would
work.
though
he
said
after
he
thought
about
it,
he
realized
they
would,
but
when
was
he
surprised?
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
this
record
showing
that
it
was
not
obvious
at
the
time
mr.
isbell
proposed
to
change
from
a
thick
antenna
to
a
thin
wire
that
it
was
not
obvious
and
judge
hoffman
did
not
find
that
it
was
not
obvious
at
the
time
isbell
made
the
invention.
he
just
said,
at
some
time
it
was
not
predictable
whether
these
different
kinds
of
things
would
work,
but
the
statute
says,
we’re
concerned
in
section
103
with
obviousness
at
the
time
of
the
invention.
and
fortunately,
we
were
able
to
put
in
a
document
which
was
contemporary
that
mr.
isbell’s
invention,
a
document
of
the
university
of
illinois
laboratory
itself
whereas
we
quote
in
our
brief
and
we
produce
this
only
two
pages
long,
in
the
first
part,
they
say,
“now,
we
can
predict
from
the
mathematics
the
operation
of
multi-element
log
periodic
antennas”
and
then
on
a
lower
paragraph
it
says,
“mr.
isbell
is
going
to
thin
this
down
now
into
zero
with
almost
little
wires.”
and
that
document
itself
contemporaneous
not
in
the
anticipation
of
lawsuits
shows
beyond
any
reasonable
doubt
even
if
these
were
criminal
test
that
at
that
time
it
was
completely
obvious
to
those
skilled
in
the
art
that
isbell’s
trivial
change
was
an
experiment
but
not
something
that
was
unobvious
to
those
skilled
in
the
art.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
yes,
it
was.
this
was
tried
before
judge
stevenson
and
judge
stevenson
found
what
i
have
just
told
you,
the
court
of
appeals
sustained
it.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
excuse
me?
mr.
robert
h.
rines
that’s
right
judge
blackmun.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
you’re
absolutely
right,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
it’s
not
synonymous
with
obviousness,
but
you
see
judge
hoffman,
we
believe
fell
into
the
err
of
making
it
synonymous
with
obviousness
and
his
grounds
where
since
it
was
unpredictable,
i
therefore,
think
it’s
unobvious.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
in
eighth
circuit
said,
“that’s
not
the
test,
its
obviousness
not
predictability.”
they
said,
“if
it
will
be
obvious
for
a
skilled
person
what
to
try
even
when
you
don’t
know
everything
that
is
going
to
happen
once
you
try
it.”
if
you’d
be
led
by
the
trier
to
try
this
thing,
then
that
is
not
obvious
because
it
was
unpredictable.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
i
haven’t
found
it.
the
brief
of
the
american
patent
law
association
is
pleading
with
this
court
and
i
think
we
do
too
to
stick
to
graham
versus
deere,
and
these
other
cases
where
you
have
set
forth
sensible
tests
as
to
how
do
you
determine
obviousness.
you
look
at
the
scope
of
the
prior
art,
you
look
at
the
claims,
you
compare
the
difference,
you
look
at
the
skill
of
the
man
at
that
time
and
we
feel
this
predictability
issue
comes
in,
in
that
skill.
and
would
a
man
really
have
said,
“sure,
try
that,
we
know
that.
it’s
going
to
work
somehow
even
though
i
can't
tell
you
exactly
what
the
outcome
is.”
so,
we
feel
obviousness
should
be
the
testing
and
there
isn’t
much
law
confusing
these
two
that
we've
been
able
to
find.
reaching
then
our
conclusion
that
on
a
much
better
record
and
with
an
opportunity
even
of
trial
and
expert
testimony,
the
eighth
circuit
reached
the
conclusion
of
obviousness
and
realizing
that
judge
hoffman
confused
predictability
and
obviousness.
and
at
that,
his
confusion
went
to
mr.
duhamel
talking
about
certain
as
esoteric
structures
that
weren’t
obvious.
he
didn’t
say,
“making
these
particular
little
elements
was
an
obvious.”
oh!
no.
let
me
show
you
the
testimony
that
he
talked
about
when
he
spoke
of
an
obviousness.
at
pages
412
of
volume
2
of
the
appendix,
see
this
big
conical
structure,
this
sweeping
fold
going
up
into
the
air
on
page
413,
this
zigzag
configuration,
this
vertical
thing
going
up
with
all
kinds
of
lumps
on
it,
this
is
the
testimony
of
dr.
duhamel,
these
were
the
things
he
put
in
evidence
to
convince
the
district
court.
it
wasn’t
unpredictable
that
all,
dipole
elements
could
be
shaped
in
a
log
periodic
and
come
out
right,
but
he
did
not
say
that
merely
to
take
the
prior
thick
antennas
and
make
one
wire
of
it
wasn’t
obvious.
now,
in
his
cross-examination,
dr.
duhamel,
witness
for
the
university
of
illinois
admitted
what
i
hold
in
my
hand
here
which
is
defendant’s
exhibit
24
is
a
correct
representation
of
what
he
described
in
his
prior
patent,
prior
to
isbell,
it’s
prior
up.
if
you'll
notice,
he
has
antenna
dipoles
that
vary
in
length
as
we
go
down
from
long
and
short
and
spacings
that
vary
long
and
short,
the
so-called
log
periodic
spacing.
this,
believe
it
or
not,
is
one
of
the
blonder-tongue
infringements
and
what
is
the
difference,
superficially?
instead
of
having
triangles,
we
have
straight
lines.
if
this
was
prior
art,
could
the
isbell
patent
possibly
be
valid
if
it
covers
this,
another
equally
well-known
type
of
dipole?
just
taking
and
thinning
these
triangular
loops
into
single
wires.
we
think
the
question
answers
itself.
we
come
now
to
summarize
other
points
with
regard
to
the
invalidity
of
the
isbell
patent
and
the
non-infringement
thereof.
every
claim
of
the
isbell
patent
is
restricted
to
the
idea
of
putting
of
these
antennas
as
close
as
you
can
in
one
plane,
so-called
coplanar.
judge
hoffman
read
out
of
the
claims
the
word
“coplanar”
and
found
that
a
blonder-tongue
antenna
which
is
their
principle
ones
which
had
dipoles
deliberately
in
two
widely
space
planes
which
is
the
blonder
patent
not
the
isbell
patent,
he
found
that
that
is
all
in
the
same
plane,
he
doesn’t
explain
why.
he
found
it
all
in
the
same
plane
and
hence,
he
found
the
isbell
claims
coplanar
our
claims
to
be
infringed
by
this
antenna.
when
we
came
to
the
court
of
appeals,
they
apparently
couldn’t
stomach
that
and
so
they
made
their
own
supposition.
they
said
apparently
and
all
they
were
looking
at
was
this
antenna
at
that
time.
apparently,
they
said,
“you
can’t
physically
build
these
two
sets
of
antennas
to
get
them
in
the
same
plane.”
so,
there
has
to
be
some
separation
about
the
order
of
an
inch.
hence
they
said,
“we
think
coplanar
applies
to
the
blonder-tongue
antennas.”
when
we
called
to
their
attention
that
the
real
antennas
of
blonder-tongue
are
four
inches
apart
and
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
how
close
you
can
put
these
together,
we
can
put
them
together
much
closer
mechanically,
but
it’s
an
entirely
different
purpose,
they
just
took
the
one-inch
reference
out
of
their
decision
but
let
it
stand
that
that
is
coplanar.
we
submit
that
any
such
extension
of
the
monopoly
of
a
patent
completely
began
to
file
history,
completely
beyond
everything
they
have
asked
for
strip
the
word
“coplanar”
out
of
the
claims
and
to
hold
a
new
inventor
to
be
infringing
when
it
isn’t
coplanar
and
doesn’t
even
do
the
same
thing
is
improper,
and
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
rines
this
is
the
blonder-tongue,
blonder-shinto
patent
in
our
counterclaim.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
the
isbell
patent
of
the
university
of
illinois.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
no,
this
is
also
made
in
accordance
with
the
blonder-tongue
patent.
in
other
words,
these
are
in
two
different
planes.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
i
do,
your
honor.
we
don’t
have
the
structure
of
it
as
a
model,
but
what
it
is,
your
honor
is
instead
of
having
these
two
tubes,
this
widely-space
apart,
isbell
put
them
absolutely
close
together
as
shown
in
this
patent,
almost
touching.
so
that
they
can
all
be
in
the
same
plane.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
yes,
your
honor.
they
stress
this
throughout
the
patent.
they
must
be
in
the
same
plane
and
the
reason
--
mr.
robert
h.
rines
very
close
together
as
close
together
as
you
can
get
it.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
that’s
their
whole
claim,
coplanar
antennas
in
one
plane
shaped
for
these
wires
in
this
taper-shaped
log
width
mic
shape
we
talked
about.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
no,
there
are
two
requirements
mr.
justice
black.
the
first
requirement
is
that
everything
be
in
the
same
plane.
the
second
requirement
is
that
the
lengths
of
these
antennas
taper
such
as
i’ve
shown
to
you
and
that
spacing
is
taper,
put
those
three
things
together
and
that's
isbell
so-called
invention.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
so
far
as
blonder-tongue
is
concerned,
it
deliberately
took
these
antennas
out
of
the
same
claim
and
space
them
a
sizable
difference
--
distance
apart
compared
to
the
wavelength
change
the
whole
concept
of
the
feed,
a
different
kind
of
electrical
feed
and
operate
with
antennas
that
are
not
anywhere
near
in
the
same
plane,
but
they
do
have
log
periodic
shape.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
that
will
be
the
difference,
yes
your
honor.
now,
the
patent
office
was
--
mr.
robert
h.
rines
blonder-tongue.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
this
is
the
subject
of
the
accused
infringement.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
since,
we
file
--
since
our
patent
came
out,
they’ve
copied
it.
so,
they
have
antennas
just
like
this.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
just
like
this
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
just
like
this
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
i
don’t
think
we
have
a
strong
patent
mr.
justice
white,
but
i
do
think
that
we’re
entitled
to
have
a
trial
on
it.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
no,
i
don’t
say
that
at
all.
isbell
has
tried
to
capture
the
whole
log
periodic
concept
of
all
kinds
of
shapes
of
dipole,
though
he
says
now
he
just
wants
the
little
ones.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
if
isbell’s
patent
were
valid,
yes
your
honor.
this
antenna
device
would
infringe
it,
no
question
about
that.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
no,
they
tried
to
capture
by
their
claim
language
mr.
justice
black.
they
don’t
say
in
the
patent
--
mr.
robert
h.
rines
oh!
the
physical
thing
they
have
is
antennas
all
in
one
plane
and
that’s
the
way
they
built
it
until
blonder
came
and
showed
a
way
that
you
didn’t
need
it
in
all
one
plane.
and
this
was
such
a
remarkable
concept
that
you
could
move
the
planes
and
still
get
log
periodicity
that
the
patent
office
granted
us
a
patent
for
it.
it
was
a
highly
unobvious
thing
we
maintained
from
all
of
the
training
before
that
everybody
tried
to
get
it
in
the
same
plane.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
maybe
obvious
to
one
skilled
in
the
art.
i'm
not
going
to
pretend
we
got
the
world’s
greatest
patent.
all
i
say
is
this
court
ought
to
guarantee
our
right
to
a
trial
and
not
have
judge
hoffman
in
one
line
say
it’s
obvious
and
completely
ignore
your
graham
versus
deere,
make
no
findings
at
all.
come
and
throw
our
patent
if
it
is
an
invention,
but
give
us
due
process
of
law.
you
lay
down
rules
in
graham
versus
deere,
the
district
court
is
supposed
to
follow.
you
said,
“make
this
finding,
make
thing
finding.”
we
have
it
in
the
rule
books,
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
what’s
he
is
suppose
to
do.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
oh!
yes.
he’s
a
pioneer
compared
to
us.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
if
you
take
this
idea
of
coplanar
and
say
i'm
going
to
read
it
out
of
the
claim
so
that
it
reads
whether
the
two
--
whether
the
dipoles
are
in
the
same
plane
or
widely
separated,
we
infringe.
but
if
you
read
coplanar
in
isbell’s
patent,
we
don’t
infringe.
we
deliberately
get
a
way
from
putting
it
in
the
same
plane.
does
that
make
that
clear?
mr.
robert
h.
rines
well,
if
i
said
that,
i
didn’t
mean
it
that
way.
i
was
saying
it
in
a
context
if
we
read
out
of
the
claim
--
coplanar
and
we
give
it
no
limitation
in
the
isbell
claim
so
that
the
things
can
be
in
the
same
plane
or
different
planes.
ii
you
took
that
out,
we
infringe
isbell’s
patent
but
that
isn’t
isbell’s
patent.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
i
admit
that.
i
just
would
like
the
right
to
try
my
patent
in
a
courts
of
america.
it’s
presumed
valid,
i’d
like
the
right
to
trial.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
yes
i
am.
the
last
concept
that
i
want
to
address
myself
to
in
connection
with
the
isbell
situation
is
that
there
was
a
publication
completely
describing
isbell’s
patent
that
was
put
in
a
local
library
more
than
one
year
before
the
filing
of
that
patent
application.
the
district
court
disputed
whether
or
not
it
was
a
real
library.
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
it
was
a
library
when
we
showed
them
the
documents
of
the
university
itself
calling
it
library
and
--
mr.
robert
h.
rines
ms.
johnson’s
operation
and
again
the
supreme
court
has
never
passed
on
this
point
so
far
as
we
can
find.
there
are
lower
court
decisions,
but
we
have
followed
that
line
of
cases
it
says,
if
you
put
in
a
library
even
a
small
library
this
constitutes
your
intention
to
make
it
public
and
the
mere
fact
that
nobody
came
to
that
library
to
draw
up
the
copy
is
immaterial.
we
found
--
mr.
robert
h.
rines
in
the
university
of
illinois,
antenna
section,
they
have
a
library
of
antenna
publications
where
people
come
and
draw
these
things
out
and
the
librarian
so
testified.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
judge
hoffman
characterized
that
for
me.
he
said,
if
this
really
was
a
library
and
the
ms.
johnson
where
a
librarian
he
said,
i'm
compelled
to
say
this
was
published
more
than
a
year
before
the
patent.
but
then
he
turned
around
and
said,
but
i
don’t
think
it’s
a
real
library;
it’s
a
tiny
place
in
the
university.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
it’s
called
eell,
the
local
library
and
this
is
the
way
it
is
on
the
distribution
sheets
of
all
the
material
that
they
send.
they
call
it
a
library.
i’d
like
to
take
just
a
few
minutes
now
on
the
matter
of
what
happened
to
us
in
the
marketplace
once
this
fraudulently
obtained
patent
in
the
patent
office
came
out.
the
foundation
and
their
licensee,
exclusive
licensee
then
jfd
took
this
patent,
published
copious
ads
all
over
the
country,
loop
magazine
we
put
in
whole
copies
of
these
announcing
that
they
had
patented
the
log
periodic
formula
that
nobody
else
could
make
log
periodic
antennas.
then
they
took
these
ads
out
into
the
marketplace.
they
used
them
to
coerce
purchasers
to
buy
only
their
products.
it
was
the
university
of
illinois
and
jfd,
they
had
the
patents
nobody
else
can
use
it
if
you
buy
blonder-tongue
you're
going
to
be
in
trouble,
we’re
going
to
sue
you
and
they
did,
they
sued
everybody.
we
maintain
that
we
have
offered
some
evidence
of
tie-in
sales
that
the
district
court
said
was
some
evidence.
we
offered
evidence
of
raiding.
we’re
in
the
heat
of
the
litigation.
they
took
away
our
employees
who
were
investigating
their
activities
and
with
them,
disappeared
all
of
the
records.
how
am
i
going
to
prove
my
case?
where
just
before
the
trial;
they
hideaway
our
co-inventor
of
our
own
patent
in
suit
so
that
i
couldn’t
use
his
testimony
on
the
matter
of
infringement.
all
of
these
--
despite
all
of
these
things,
we
did
through
depositions,
get
into
the
record
something
the
district
court
conceded
their
patent
mis-marked.
the
district
court
says,
that’s
de
minimis
though.
they
put
on
these
ads,
i
told
you
about
saying
nobody
else
could
make
an
antenna
that
they
found.
they
not
only
raided
us,
but
in
the
marketplace
they
actually
told
people,
we
have
evidence
of
this,
not
the
strongest
but
it’s
in
the
record
that
if
they
barred
any
of
blonder-tongue’s
line
they
wouldn’t
sell
them
their
patented
antennas.
and
we
maintain
that
the
district
court
in
picking
all
these
little
things
and
saying,
well,
you
haven’t
prove
this
enough,
didn’t
follow
the
law
in
looking
at
the
totality
of
all
these
acts
which
we
think
was
a
serious
antitrust
and
unfair
competition
violation
because
it
all
stemmed
from
this
fraudulently
obtained
patent
which
the
court
of
appeals
threw
out
for
that
reason,
but
they
didn’t
use
the
word
“fraud”
they
said
“deception.”
all
from
that
and
nearly
put
our
client
out
of
business.
i
would
reserve
for
my
rebuttal,
if
you
will,
answers
with
regard
to
the
solicitor
general’s
points
on
triplett
v.
lowell
and
what
my
brother
might
have
to
say
about
these
issues.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
well
on
that
subject,
my
brother
failed
to
tell
you
that
even
the
district
court
found
that
when
mr.
ballash,
the
head
of
our
whole
antenna
program
left,
all
of
the
records
at
blonder-tongue
dealing
with
the
customer
relations,
and
the
investigation
that
mr.
balllsh
was
making
for
this
very
suit
for
the
pleading,
mysteriously
disappeared.
i
think
also
we
should
bring
out
who
are
these
key
people
that
were
raided.
you
cannot
compare
the
fact
that
in
a
factory
you
let
so
many
people
go
when
you
have
production
and
so
many
people
come
back.
it's
not
a
numbers
game
for
raiding.
they
took
the
head
of
the
antenna
business.
they
took
all
of
our
proofs
and
records
with
regard
to
the
customers.
they
took
our
co-inventor
of
the
blonder
patent
who
was
going
to
testify
about
the
infringement.
he
took
all
the
tests,
and
this
was
taken
just
before
the
trial
maybe
a
month
or
so
before.
in
addition,
we
had
one
bit
of
evidence
on
the
west
coast
about
customers.
they
took
away
just
before
the
trial
mr.
sisson
(ph),
our
west
coast
sales
representative,
so
we
couldn't
use
him
as
a
witness.
so
i
don't
think
raiding
is
a
numbers
game.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
your
honor
i
think
that
is
correct.
the
question
that
was
asked
of
us
in
our
brief
by
this
court
was
should
triplett
be
overruled?
that
we
answered
no.
now,
the
question
is
should
there
be
modification?
i
think
in
all
of
law
where
somebody
is
abusing
it
or
somebody
is
not
taking
advantage
of
what
is
intended
by
something,
there
are
exceptions.
now,
i
think
the
solicitor
is
very
close
to
us
in
the
idea
that,
if
in
fact
this
was
the
same
trial
and
they
had
the
opportunity
to
present
their
witnesses
before
and
they
didn't
do
it,
that
seriously
it
ought
be
considered
whether
there
be
and
estoppel
in
a
situation
such
this.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
no
we
did
not.
understandably
we
didn’t
have
the
decision
at
the
time
of
the
pleading.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
the
last
thing
i
would
like
to
bring
out
is
on
this
matter
of
obviousness
just
a
quote
from
page
499,
the
experimental
results
which
have
been
obtained
from
the
multi-element
log
periodic
antennas
are
found
to
be
predictable
and
a
few
sentences
later,
an
investigation
of
log
periodic
structures
of
thin
linear
elements,
that's
isbell,
is
planned.
what's
that
from?
the
antenna
report
of
the
antenna
laboratories
of
the
university
of
illinois,
30th
of
january,
1959
at
the
time
that
isbell
made
his
so
called
invention,
that's
the
disclosure
of
the
invention.
predictability
in
their
words
before
litigation,
not
now,
and
not
in
the
eighth
circuit,
yes.
i
lastly
like
to
plead
with
this
court
that
the
solicitor
general
has
done
a
very
gracious
thing
i
think
in
presenting
a
balanced
picture
on
triplett
v.
lowe.
i
want
to
read
from
the
top
of
page
32
of
his
brief,
and
this
is
what
a
solicitor
general
is
for
i
think.
“it
is
as
important
that
sound
patents
and
invention
be
rewarded
as
that
the
public
be
protected
against
bad
monopolies
based
on
insufficient
invention.
both
are
strong
public
policies,
please,
please
restore
to
the
patentee,
his
right
to
due
process
in
the
federal
courts
of
america.”
thank
you.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
to
take
one
moment
to
introduce
my
father,
teacher,
and
partner
mr.
david
rines,
my
co-counsel
from
chicago,
mr.
richard
phillips.
this
case
involves
a
conflict
of
decisions
between
the
eighth
circuit
and
the
seventh
circuit
with
regard
to
the
validity
of
a
patent
to
isbell
dealing
with
television
antennas,
the
type
that
i'm
sure,
your
honors
have
seen
cluttering
our
landscape
on
the
roofs
of
houses
which
are
very
necessary
in
order
to
get
good
television
reception
in
the
homes.
i
have
here
typical
antenna
of
the
type
i'm
sure
you’ve
seen
on
the
roofs,
involving
what
we
call
dipoles,
nothing
magical
about
that,
just
little
rods
which
are
tuned
and
corrected
in
terms
to
dimensions
and
direction
to
receive
from
the
television
transmitting
stations
the
signals
that
we
tune
into
our
television.
in
the
eighth
circuit,
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
the
isbell
patent
which
is
owned
by
the
university
of
illinois
foundation
to
be
invalid
for
obviousness
in
the
light
of
the
teaching
of
the
prior
art.
the
university
of
illinois
foundation
filed
not
just
one
suit,
in
the
winegard
case
which
is
at
eighth
circuit
case,
but
filed
the
suit
against
blonder-tongue,
a
new
jersey
corporation
in
chicago
by
suing
a
customer
and
joining
blonder-tongue
and
a
whole
host
of
other
manufacturers
throughout
the
land.
when
a
decision
went
against
them
in
the
winegard
district
court
and
while
they
were
appealing
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
eighth
circuit,
the
university
of
illinois
foundation
pursued
the
suit
against
blonder-tongue
in
new
jersey,
on
exactly
the
same
patent,
there
was
also
another
patent
involved
and
we
went
to
trial
before
a
judge
hoffman.
one
of
the
issues
in
our
presentation
is
the
fact
that
we
were
forced
to
this
trial
without
the
benefit
of
a
single
witness
during
the
whole
presentation
of
the
university
of
illinois'
case
in-chief.
as
a
result
of
the
fact
that
when
we
were
ready
in
december
18th,
the
trial
date
with
our
cambridge,
massachusetts
expert
who’d
worked
over
a
year
on
this
with
us,
with
mr.
blonder,
and
various
customer
witnesses
from
all
over
the
country
and
myself
in
boston,
the
judge
could
not
hear
it
on
the
18th
and
he
couldn’t
set
a
time
for
postponement,
19th,
20th
and
21st,
we
still
didn’t
have
a
trial
date.
the
result
was
that
the
day
before
christmas
the
trial
was
set
for
two
days
after
christmas
and
i
was
not
able
to
reassemble
any
of
my
witnesses
and
the
district
court
refused
to
give
me
a
few
days
in
which
to
this
but
forced
us
to
go
to
trial
without
any
witnesses
at
all.
therefore,
we
were
not
able
to
produce
any
live
witnesses
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
isbell
patent
was
or
was
not
valid
for
our
business
or
any
other
reason.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
it
had
been
set
several
times,
but
then
was
postponed
mr.
justice
potter,
until
december
18th.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
the
prior
trial
of
judge
hoffman
had
not
been
finished.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
a
prior
trial
of
the
district
court
had
had
not
been
finished,
so
it
was
postponed
to
december
18th.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
oh!
no,
there
were
several
during,
at
the
request
of
the
parties,
at
the
request
of
the
court,
this
is
about
six
or
seven
postponement,
but
we’re
all
zero
it
in
for
december
18th,
we
were
all
there.
therefore,
the
record
that
has
been
produced
in
this
case
is
only
the
documents
that
we
were
able
to
put
in
before
judge
hoffman
which
were
the
same
documents
before
the
district
court
in
the
eighth
circuit
litigation,
the
winegard
litigation
and
we
had
to
argue
therefore
from
those
documents
without
the
benefit
of
any
expert
or
any
witnesses
at
all,
these
issues
of
obviousness
and
validity.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
yes,
there
was.
the
other
side,
the
defendant
had
a
right
and
did
produce
an
expert
and
the
court
--
mr.
robert
h.
rines
wasn’t
in
that.
no,
i'm
a
different
defendant.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
yes
he
did
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
so
the
issue
squarely
before
this
court
is
who
was
right
in
terms
to
this
conclusion
of
obviousness
on
substantially
the
same
record,
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
eighth
circuit
or
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
seventh
circuit?
and
under
the
doctrine
of
triplett
v.
lowell,
to
which
we
will
address
ourselves
also,
if
you
recall,
when
a
conflict
does
arise
because
a
patentee
has
a
second
bite
of
the
pie,
if
he
loses
in
a
first
circuit,
the
decision
must
rest
with
this
supreme
court
as
to
whether
the
patent
is
valid
or
invalid.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
so
far
as
the
documents
are
concerned
--
mr.
robert
h.
rines
yes.
but
he
had
more
evidence
in
the
eighth
circuit
because
they
have
live
witnesses
and
experts
which
we
were
not
able
to
produce
before
judge
hoffman.
so,
a
fuller
trial
was
held
in
the
eighth
circuit
than
we
have
in
the
seventh
circuit.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
no,
it
is
not
mr.
chief
justice.
in
addition,
in
--
mr.
robert
h.
rines
no,
i'm
not.
i
maintain
that
my
brother
here
did
have
a
right
if
there
was
a
genuine
new
issue
or
some
other
interpretations
of
a
claim
or
some
interpretation
of
law
in
another
circuit
as
different
in
this
circuit,
he
had
a
right
to
try
under
triplett
v.
lowell
in
another
circuit.
but
in
this
particular
case
where
we’re
stuck
with
substantially
the
same
documentary
evidence,
where
we
were
not
able
to
produce
even
that
modicum
of
expert
testimony
that
existed
in
the
eighth
circuit,
we
think
there
may
be
as
suggested
by
the
solicitor
general
some
reason
for
modification
of
that
doctrine
in
a
case
such
as
this.
the
real
question
that
is
before
this
court
is
on
the
matter
of
obviousness
at
the
time
that
mr.
isbell
made
his
invention,
what
was
the
knowledge
in
the
art?
what
was
the
skill
of
the
ordinary
mechanic?
what
have
been
known?
and
we
were
very
fortunate
that
one
distinction
between
these
two
trials
was
that
the
university
of
illinois
at
this
time
in
blonder-tongue
case
chose
to
take
in
some
prior
investigators
in
this
field
namely
dr.
duhamel,
who
had
pioneered
this
kind
of
antenna
at
the
university
of
illinois
many
years
before.
so
he
was
produced
as
a
plaintiff’s
witness
and
fortunately
through
cross-examination,
we
were
able
to
get
from
mr.
duhamel,
admissions
that
we
think
bolsters
this
concept
of
complete
and
obviousness
of
this
invention
at
the
time
that
mr.
isbell
made
it.
now
the
district
--
mr.
robert
h.
rines
it
is
not
for
the
edification
of
the
court.
there
were
two
patents
sued
on
by
the
university
of
illinois.
one
was
the
isbell
patent,
which
is
this
kind
of
an
antenna
not
this
where
these
rods
here
instead
of
being
off
at
an
angle,
come
out
straight,
that’s
isbell.
then
they
had
a
second
patent
the
mayes
who
just
took
these
rods
and
bent
them
in
this
way
into
a
“v.”
the
district
court
found
both
of
those
patents
valid.
the
court
of
appeals
threw
out
the
“v”
patent
saying
it
wasn’t
invalid.
so
that's
not
an
issue
in
the
supreme
court,
it
has
not
been
appealed.
however,
one
issue
that
is
involved
is
that
at
the
time
that
they
obtained
this
mayes
patent
in
the
patent
office,
counsel
who
were
prosecuting
both
the
isbell
and
mayes
patents
together
filed
an
affidavit
in
the
patent
office
which
we
maintain
was
fraudulent
as
a
result
of
which
this
mayes
patent
issue.
that
affidavit
concerned
both
inventions,
both
isbell
patent
and
the
mayes
patent
inventions
and
one
of
our
contentions
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
having
reversed
judge
hoffman
and
find
that
this
affidavit
was
less
than
candid
and
that
it
was
deliberately
given
to
mislead
the
patent
office
that
one
of
the
questions
we
raised
is
whether
under
those
circumstances,
there
should
be
any
standing
in
equity
on
either
patents
for
the
plaintiff.
and
also
involved
in
our
case
is
the
fact
that
the
minute,
the
fruits
of
this
fraud
were
obtained,
out
in
the
market
place
they
went
with
copious
advertisements
telling
the
whole
world
they
invented
the
broad
log
periodic
antenna,
nobody
else
could
make
one
and
this
coupled
with
a
whole
series
of
other
acts
almost
put
our
client
out
of
a
business.
so
that
we
have
a
counterclaim
which
is
in
point
2,
if
you
will,
question
number
4
now
before
this
court
as
to
whether
this
is
fair
competition
and
whether
this
is
not
violative
of
the
antitrust
laws
to
take
the
fruits
of
an
illegally
obtained
patent
and
use
it
the
way
it
was
used
in
the
marketplace
to
suppress
competition.
turning
back
for
the
moment
to
the
obviousness
of
the
isbell
patent,
at
the
time
that
isbell
made
his
invention,
this
whole
magic
of
log
periodicity
had
been
invented
long
since
as
judge
hoffman
found,
in
the
early
1950’s,
at
the
university
of
illinois.
it’s
very
simple.
what
it
means
is
that
in
order
to
have
your
television
antenna,
listen
to
all
of
the
channels
from
the
low
frequencies
to
the
high
frequencies,
we
pit
in
a
whole
bunch
of
these
antennas
and
we
tuned
them
to
different
frequencies
and
if
you
shape
them
in
the
way
that
they
go
from
the
long
wavelengths,
down
to
the
short
wavelengths,
just
taper
the
shape,
that’s
a
log-width
variation,
that’s
all
it
means
and
if
you
space
it
also
in
accordance
with
the
length
that
again
is
a
log-width
in
variation.
those
principles
and
that
discovery,
we
all
admit
was
known
before
isbell
came
into
the
scene.
what
then
that
isbell
claim
was
his
invention?
“uh-huh,”
he
said,
other
people
while
they
have
done
that
variation
of
having
long
shorter,
shorter,
shorter,
shorter,
shorter,
while
they
have
done
that
before,
they
didn’t
do
with
the
simple
single
wire.
they
did
it
of
what
he
calls
“teeth.”
you
see
this
a
little
a
triangular
teeth
and
they
didn’t
take
and
just
use
one
wire
instead
of
the
tooth.
so
this
is
supposedly
what
mr.
isbell
invented,
but
when
mr.
harris,
their
expert
got
on
the
stand,
he
admitted
to
us
as
shown
in
the
record
here
that
the
ideas
of
these
teeth
or
straight
lines,
or
folded
lines,
these
were
all
well-known
dipoles,
all
well-known
antennas
and
in
fact,
they
all
operate
the
same
way
to
produce
the
same
result.
i
would
like
to
hold
up
for
you
from
appendix,
volume
2,
if
i
may,
page
475,
the
sketches
that
their
witness,
mr.
harris
put
on
the
board
and
which
we
transcribed
on
the
paper,
475
and
476
where
he
shows,
if
your
honors
please,
first,
the
straight
lines,
that’s
the
straight
line
dipoles
so-called
of
isbell.
and
up
above
what
he
shows
what
the
current
is,
this
loop
dash
line,
that
means
the
radio
currents
go
across
the
antenna
in
that
kind
of
a
distribution.
then
on
the
next
page,
mr.
harris,
their
expert,
sketches
these
triangular
loops
such
as
i
showed
you
in
items
6
and
he
shows
the
same
current
distribution.
and
below
that
he
shows
that
you
could
fold
the
wire
into
a
rectangular
loop
and
get
the
same
current
distribution.
and
there's
no
dispute
but
that
all
of
these
antennas
were
known
long
before
isbell,
decades.
so,
that
the
question
resolves
itself
into,
can
you
give
us
many
patents
as
there
are
well-known
types
of
antenna
shapes
by
just
magically
putting
them
in
this
whole
formula
for
log
periodicity?
and
this
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
eighth
circuit
found
to
answer
in
a
negative,
but
this
is
what
judge
hoffman
answered
in
the
affirmative.
now,
why?
judge
hoffman
was
impressed
by
mr.
duhamel’s
testimony
that
he
was
surprised
that
these
straight
line
elements
would
work.
though
he
said
after
he
thought
about
it,
he
realized
they
would,
but
when
was
he
surprised?
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
this
record
showing
that
it
was
not
obvious
at
the
time
mr.
isbell
proposed
to
change
from
a
thick
antenna
to
a
thin
wire
that
it
was
not
obvious
and
judge
hoffman
did
not
find
that
it
was
not
obvious
at
the
time
isbell
made
the
invention.
he
just
said,
at
some
time
it
was
not
predictable
whether
these
different
kinds
of
things
would
work,
but
the
statute
says,
we’re
concerned
in
section
103
with
obviousness
at
the
time
of
the
invention.
and
fortunately,
we
were
able
to
put
in
a
document
which
was
contemporary
that
mr.
isbell’s
invention,
a
document
of
the
university
of
illinois
laboratory
itself
whereas
we
quote
in
our
brief
and
we
produce
this
only
two
pages
long,
in
the
first
part,
they
say,
“now,
we
can
predict
from
the
mathematics
the
operation
of
multi-element
log
periodic
antennas”
and
then
on
a
lower
paragraph
it
says,
“mr.
isbell
is
going
to
thin
this
down
now
into
zero
with
almost
little
wires.”
and
that
document
itself
contemporaneous
not
in
the
anticipation
of
lawsuits
shows
beyond
any
reasonable
doubt
even
if
these
were
criminal
test
that
at
that
time
it
was
completely
obvious
to
those
skilled
in
the
art
that
isbell’s
trivial
change
was
an
experiment
but
not
something
that
was
unobvious
to
those
skilled
in
the
art.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
yes,
it
was.
this
was
tried
before
judge
stevenson
and
judge
stevenson
found
what
i
have
just
told
you,
the
court
of
appeals
sustained
it.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
excuse
me?
mr.
robert
h.
rines
that’s
right
judge
blackmun.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
you’re
absolutely
right,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
it’s
not
synonymous
with
obviousness,
but
you
see
judge
hoffman,
we
believe
fell
into
the
err
of
making
it
synonymous
with
obviousness
and
his
grounds
where
since
it
was
unpredictable,
i
therefore,
think
it’s
unobvious.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
in
eighth
circuit
said,
“that’s
not
the
test,
its
obviousness
not
predictability.”
they
said,
“if
it
will
be
obvious
for
a
skilled
person
what
to
try
even
when
you
don’t
know
everything
that
is
going
to
happen
once
you
try
it.”
if
you’d
be
led
by
the
trier
to
try
this
thing,
then
that
is
not
obvious
because
it
was
unpredictable.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
i
haven’t
found
it.
the
brief
of
the
american
patent
law
association
is
pleading
with
this
court
and
i
think
we
do
too
to
stick
to
graham
versus
deere,
and
these
other
cases
where
you
have
set
forth
sensible
tests
as
to
how
do
you
determine
obviousness.
you
look
at
the
scope
of
the
prior
art,
you
look
at
the
claims,
you
compare
the
difference,
you
look
at
the
skill
of
the
man
at
that
time
and
we
feel
this
predictability
issue
comes
in,
in
that
skill.
and
would
a
man
really
have
said,
“sure,
try
that,
we
know
that.
it’s
going
to
work
somehow
even
though
i
can't
tell
you
exactly
what
the
outcome
is.”
so,
we
feel
obviousness
should
be
the
testing
and
there
isn’t
much
law
confusing
these
two
that
we've
been
able
to
find.
reaching
then
our
conclusion
that
on
a
much
better
record
and
with
an
opportunity
even
of
trial
and
expert
testimony,
the
eighth
circuit
reached
the
conclusion
of
obviousness
and
realizing
that
judge
hoffman
confused
predictability
and
obviousness.
and
at
that,
his
confusion
went
to
mr.
duhamel
talking
about
certain
as
esoteric
structures
that
weren’t
obvious.
he
didn’t
say,
“making
these
particular
little
elements
was
an
obvious.”
oh!
no.
let
me
show
you
the
testimony
that
he
talked
about
when
he
spoke
of
an
obviousness.
at
pages
412
of
volume
2
of
the
appendix,
see
this
big
conical
structure,
this
sweeping
fold
going
up
into
the
air
on
page
413,
this
zigzag
configuration,
this
vertical
thing
going
up
with
all
kinds
of
lumps
on
it,
this
is
the
testimony
of
dr.
duhamel,
these
were
the
things
he
put
in
evidence
to
convince
the
district
court.
it
wasn’t
unpredictable
that
all,
dipole
elements
could
be
shaped
in
a
log
periodic
and
come
out
right,
but
he
did
not
say
that
merely
to
take
the
prior
thick
antennas
and
make
one
wire
of
it
wasn’t
obvious.
now,
in
his
cross-examination,
dr.
duhamel,
witness
for
the
university
of
illinois
admitted
what
i
hold
in
my
hand
here
which
is
defendant’s
exhibit
24
is
a
correct
representation
of
what
he
described
in
his
prior
patent,
prior
to
isbell,
it’s
prior
up.
if
you'll
notice,
he
has
antenna
dipoles
that
vary
in
length
as
we
go
down
from
long
and
short
and
spacings
that
vary
long
and
short,
the
so-called
log
periodic
spacing.
this,
believe
it
or
not,
is
one
of
the
blonder-tongue
infringements
and
what
is
the
difference,
superficially?
instead
of
having
triangles,
we
have
straight
lines.
if
this
was
prior
art,
could
the
isbell
patent
possibly
be
valid
if
it
covers
this,
another
equally
well-known
type
of
dipole?
just
taking
and
thinning
these
triangular
loops
into
single
wires.
we
think
the
question
answers
itself.
we
come
now
to
summarize
other
points
with
regard
to
the
invalidity
of
the
isbell
patent
and
the
non-infringement
thereof.
every
claim
of
the
isbell
patent
is
restricted
to
the
idea
of
putting
of
these
antennas
as
close
as
you
can
in
one
plane,
so-called
coplanar.
judge
hoffman
read
out
of
the
claims
the
word
“coplanar”
and
found
that
a
blonder-tongue
antenna
which
is
their
principle
ones
which
had
dipoles
deliberately
in
two
widely
space
planes
which
is
the
blonder
patent
not
the
isbell
patent,
he
found
that
that
is
all
in
the
same
plane,
he
doesn’t
explain
why.
he
found
it
all
in
the
same
plane
and
hence,
he
found
the
isbell
claims
coplanar
our
claims
to
be
infringed
by
this
antenna.
when
we
came
to
the
court
of
appeals,
they
apparently
couldn’t
stomach
that
and
so
they
made
their
own
supposition.
they
said
apparently
and
all
they
were
looking
at
was
this
antenna
at
that
time.
apparently,
they
said,
“you
can’t
physically
build
these
two
sets
of
antennas
to
get
them
in
the
same
plane.”
so,
there
has
to
be
some
separation
about
the
order
of
an
inch.
hence
they
said,
“we
think
coplanar
applies
to
the
blonder-tongue
antennas.”
when
we
called
to
their
attention
that
the
real
antennas
of
blonder-tongue
are
four
inches
apart
and
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
how
close
you
can
put
these
together,
we
can
put
them
together
much
closer
mechanically,
but
it’s
an
entirely
different
purpose,
they
just
took
the
one-inch
reference
out
of
their
decision
but
let
it
stand
that
that
is
coplanar.
we
submit
that
any
such
extension
of
the
monopoly
of
a
patent
completely
began
to
file
history,
completely
beyond
everything
they
have
asked
for
strip
the
word
“coplanar”
out
of
the
claims
and
to
hold
a
new
inventor
to
be
infringing
when
it
isn’t
coplanar
and
doesn’t
even
do
the
same
thing
is
improper,
and
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
rines
this
is
the
blonder-tongue,
blonder-shinto
patent
in
our
counterclaim.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
the
isbell
patent
of
the
university
of
illinois.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
no,
this
is
also
made
in
accordance
with
the
blonder-tongue
patent.
in
other
words,
these
are
in
two
different
planes.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
i
do,
your
honor.
we
don’t
have
the
structure
of
it
as
a
model,
but
what
it
is,
your
honor
is
instead
of
having
these
two
tubes,
this
widely-space
apart,
isbell
put
them
absolutely
close
together
as
shown
in
this
patent,
almost
touching.
so
that
they
can
all
be
in
the
same
plane.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
yes,
your
honor.
they
stress
this
throughout
the
patent.
they
must
be
in
the
same
plane
and
the
reason
--
mr.
robert
h.
rines
very
close
together
as
close
together
as
you
can
get
it.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
that’s
their
whole
claim,
coplanar
antennas
in
one
plane
shaped
for
these
wires
in
this
taper-shaped
log
width
mic
shape
we
talked
about.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
no,
there
are
two
requirements
mr.
justice
black.
the
first
requirement
is
that
everything
be
in
the
same
plane.
the
second
requirement
is
that
the
lengths
of
these
antennas
taper
such
as
i’ve
shown
to
you
and
that
spacing
is
taper,
put
those
three
things
together
and
that's
isbell
so-called
invention.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
so
far
as
blonder-tongue
is
concerned,
it
deliberately
took
these
antennas
out
of
the
same
claim
and
space
them
a
sizable
difference
--
distance
apart
compared
to
the
wavelength
change
the
whole
concept
of
the
feed,
a
different
kind
of
electrical
feed
and
operate
with
antennas
that
are
not
anywhere
near
in
the
same
plane,
but
they
do
have
log
periodic
shape.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
that
will
be
the
difference,
yes
your
honor.
now,
the
patent
office
was
--
mr.
robert
h.
rines
blonder-tongue.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
this
is
the
subject
of
the
accused
infringement.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
since,
we
file
--
since
our
patent
came
out,
they’ve
copied
it.
so,
they
have
antennas
just
like
this.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
just
like
this
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
just
like
this
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
i
don’t
think
we
have
a
strong
patent
mr.
justice
white,
but
i
do
think
that
we’re
entitled
to
have
a
trial
on
it.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
no,
i
don’t
say
that
at
all.
isbell
has
tried
to
capture
the
whole
log
periodic
concept
of
all
kinds
of
shapes
of
dipole,
though
he
says
now
he
just
wants
the
little
ones.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
if
isbell’s
patent
were
valid,
yes
your
honor.
this
antenna
device
would
infringe
it,
no
question
about
that.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
no,
they
tried
to
capture
by
their
claim
language
mr.
justice
black.
they
don’t
say
in
the
patent
--
mr.
robert
h.
rines
oh!
the
physical
thing
they
have
is
antennas
all
in
one
plane
and
that’s
the
way
they
built
it
until
blonder
came
and
showed
a
way
that
you
didn’t
need
it
in
all
one
plane.
and
this
was
such
a
remarkable
concept
that
you
could
move
the
planes
and
still
get
log
periodicity
that
the
patent
office
granted
us
a
patent
for
it.
it
was
a
highly
unobvious
thing
we
maintained
from
all
of
the
training
before
that
everybody
tried
to
get
it
in
the
same
plane.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
maybe
obvious
to
one
skilled
in
the
art.
i'm
not
going
to
pretend
we
got
the
world’s
greatest
patent.
all
i
say
is
this
court
ought
to
guarantee
our
right
to
a
trial
and
not
have
judge
hoffman
in
one
line
say
it’s
obvious
and
completely
ignore
your
graham
versus
deere,
make
no
findings
at
all.
come
and
throw
our
patent
if
it
is
an
invention,
but
give
us
due
process
of
law.
you
lay
down
rules
in
graham
versus
deere,
the
district
court
is
supposed
to
follow.
you
said,
“make
this
finding,
make
thing
finding.”
we
have
it
in
the
rule
books,
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
what’s
he
is
suppose
to
do.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
oh!
yes.
he’s
a
pioneer
compared
to
us.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
if
you
take
this
idea
of
coplanar
and
say
i'm
going
to
read
it
out
of
the
claim
so
that
it
reads
whether
the
two
--
whether
the
dipoles
are
in
the
same
plane
or
widely
separated,
we
infringe.
but
if
you
read
coplanar
in
isbell’s
patent,
we
don’t
infringe.
we
deliberately
get
a
way
from
putting
it
in
the
same
plane.
does
that
make
that
clear?
mr.
robert
h.
rines
well,
if
i
said
that,
i
didn’t
mean
it
that
way.
i
was
saying
it
in
a
context
if
we
read
out
of
the
claim
--
coplanar
and
we
give
it
no
limitation
in
the
isbell
claim
so
that
the
things
can
be
in
the
same
plane
or
different
planes.
ii
you
took
that
out,
we
infringe
isbell’s
patent
but
that
isn’t
isbell’s
patent.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
i
admit
that.
i
just
would
like
the
right
to
try
my
patent
in
a
courts
of
america.
it’s
presumed
valid,
i’d
like
the
right
to
trial.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
yes
i
am.
the
last
concept
that
i
want
to
address
myself
to
in
connection
with
the
isbell
situation
is
that
there
was
a
publication
completely
describing
isbell’s
patent
that
was
put
in
a
local
library
more
than
one
year
before
the
filing
of
that
patent
application.
the
district
court
disputed
whether
or
not
it
was
a
real
library.
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
it
was
a
library
when
we
showed
them
the
documents
of
the
university
itself
calling
it
library
and
--
mr.
robert
h.
rines
ms.
johnson’s
operation
and
again
the
supreme
court
has
never
passed
on
this
point
so
far
as
we
can
find.
there
are
lower
court
decisions,
but
we
have
followed
that
line
of
cases
it
says,
if
you
put
in
a
library
even
a
small
library
this
constitutes
your
intention
to
make
it
public
and
the
mere
fact
that
nobody
came
to
that
library
to
draw
up
the
copy
is
immaterial.
we
found
--
mr.
robert
h.
rines
in
the
university
of
illinois,
antenna
section,
they
have
a
library
of
antenna
publications
where
people
come
and
draw
these
things
out
and
the
librarian
so
testified.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
judge
hoffman
characterized
that
for
me.
he
said,
if
this
really
was
a
library
and
the
ms.
johnson
where
a
librarian
he
said,
i'm
compelled
to
say
this
was
published
more
than
a
year
before
the
patent.
but
then
he
turned
around
and
said,
but
i
don’t
think
it’s
a
real
library;
it’s
a
tiny
place
in
the
university.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
it’s
called
eell,
the
local
library
and
this
is
the
way
it
is
on
the
distribution
sheets
of
all
the
material
that
they
send.
they
call
it
a
library.
i’d
like
to
take
just
a
few
minutes
now
on
the
matter
of
what
happened
to
us
in
the
marketplace
once
this
fraudulently
obtained
patent
in
the
patent
office
came
out.
the
foundation
and
their
licensee,
exclusive
licensee
then
jfd
took
this
patent,
published
copious
ads
all
over
the
country,
loop
magazine
we
put
in
whole
copies
of
these
announcing
that
they
had
patented
the
log
periodic
formula
that
nobody
else
could
make
log
periodic
antennas.
then
they
took
these
ads
out
into
the
marketplace.
they
used
them
to
coerce
purchasers
to
buy
only
their
products.
it
was
the
university
of
illinois
and
jfd,
they
had
the
patents
nobody
else
can
use
it
if
you
buy
blonder-tongue
you're
going
to
be
in
trouble,
we’re
going
to
sue
you
and
they
did,
they
sued
everybody.
we
maintain
that
we
have
offered
some
evidence
of
tie-in
sales
that
the
district
court
said
was
some
evidence.
we
offered
evidence
of
raiding.
we’re
in
the
heat
of
the
litigation.
they
took
away
our
employees
who
were
investigating
their
activities
and
with
them,
disappeared
all
of
the
records.
how
am
i
going
to
prove
my
case?
where
just
before
the
trial;
they
hideaway
our
co-inventor
of
our
own
patent
in
suit
so
that
i
couldn’t
use
his
testimony
on
the
matter
of
infringement.
all
of
these
--
despite
all
of
these
things,
we
did
through
depositions,
get
into
the
record
something
the
district
court
conceded
their
patent
mis-marked.
the
district
court
says,
that’s
de
minimis
though.
they
put
on
these
ads,
i
told
you
about
saying
nobody
else
could
make
an
antenna
that
they
found.
they
not
only
raided
us,
but
in
the
marketplace
they
actually
told
people,
we
have
evidence
of
this,
not
the
strongest
but
it’s
in
the
record
that
if
they
barred
any
of
blonder-tongue’s
line
they
wouldn’t
sell
them
their
patented
antennas.
and
we
maintain
that
the
district
court
in
picking
all
these
little
things
and
saying,
well,
you
haven’t
prove
this
enough,
didn’t
follow
the
law
in
looking
at
the
totality
of
all
these
acts
which
we
think
was
a
serious
antitrust
and
unfair
competition
violation
because
it
all
stemmed
from
this
fraudulently
obtained
patent
which
the
court
of
appeals
threw
out
for
that
reason,
but
they
didn’t
use
the
word
“fraud”
they
said
“deception.”
all
from
that
and
nearly
put
our
client
out
of
business.
i
would
reserve
for
my
rebuttal,
if
you
will,
answers
with
regard
to
the
solicitor
general’s
points
on
triplett
v.
lowell
and
what
my
brother
might
have
to
say
about
these
issues.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
well
on
that
subject,
my
brother
failed
to
tell
you
that
even
the
district
court
found
that
when
mr.
ballash,
the
head
of
our
whole
antenna
program
left,
all
of
the
records
at
blonder-tongue
dealing
with
the
customer
relations,
and
the
investigation
that
mr.
balllsh
was
making
for
this
very
suit
for
the
pleading,
mysteriously
disappeared.
i
think
also
we
should
bring
out
who
are
these
key
people
that
were
raided.
you
cannot
compare
the
fact
that
in
a
factory
you
let
so
many
people
go
when
you
have
production
and
so
many
people
come
back.
it's
not
a
numbers
game
for
raiding.
they
took
the
head
of
the
antenna
business.
they
took
all
of
our
proofs
and
records
with
regard
to
the
customers.
they
took
our
co-inventor
of
the
blonder
patent
who
was
going
to
testify
about
the
infringement.
he
took
all
the
tests,
and
this
was
taken
just
before
the
trial
maybe
a
month
or
so
before.
in
addition,
we
had
one
bit
of
evidence
on
the
west
coast
about
customers.
they
took
away
just
before
the
trial
mr.
sisson
(ph),
our
west
coast
sales
representative,
so
we
couldn't
use
him
as
a
witness.
so
i
don't
think
raiding
is
a
numbers
game.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
your
honor
i
think
that
is
correct.
the
question
that
was
asked
of
us
in
our
brief
by
this
court
was
should
triplett
be
overruled?
that
we
answered
no.
now,
the
question
is
should
there
be
modification?
i
think
in
all
of
law
where
somebody
is
abusing
it
or
somebody
is
not
taking
advantage
of
what
is
intended
by
something,
there
are
exceptions.
now,
i
think
the
solicitor
is
very
close
to
us
in
the
idea
that,
if
in
fact
this
was
the
same
trial
and
they
had
the
opportunity
to
present
their
witnesses
before
and
they
didn't
do
it,
that
seriously
it
ought
be
considered
whether
there
be
and
estoppel
in
a
situation
such
this.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
no
we
did
not.
understandably
we
didn’t
have
the
decision
at
the
time
of
the
pleading.
mr.
robert
h.
rines
the
last
thing
i
would
like
to
bring
out
is
on
this
matter
of
obviousness
just
a
quote
from
page
499,
the
experimental
results
which
have
been
obtained
from
the
multi-element
log
periodic
antennas
are
found
to
be
predictable
and
a
few
sentences
later,
an
investigation
of
log
periodic
structures
of
thin
linear
elements,
that's
isbell,
is
planned.
what's
that
from?
the
antenna
report
of
the
antenna
laboratories
of
the
university
of
illinois,
30th
of
january,
1959
at
the
time
that
isbell
made
his
so
called
invention,
that's
the
disclosure
of
the
invention.
predictability
in
their
words
before
litigation,
not
now,
and
not
in
the
eighth
circuit,
yes.
i
lastly
like
to
plead
with
this
court
that
the
solicitor
general
has
done
a
very
gracious
thing
i
think
in
presenting
a
balanced
picture
on
triplett
v.
lowe.
i
want
to
read
from
the
top
of
page
32
of
his
brief,
and
this
is
what
a
solicitor
general
is
for
i
think.
“it
is
as
important
that
sound
patents
and
invention
be
rewarded
as
that
the
public
be
protected
against
bad
monopolies
based
on
insufficient
invention.
both
are
strong
public
policies,
please,
please
restore
to
the
patentee,
his
right
to
due
process
in
the
federal
courts
of
america.”
thank
you.
