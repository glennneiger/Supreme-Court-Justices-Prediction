mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
appears
as
amicus
in
this
matter
today
solely
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
or
to
what
extent
the
court
should
continue
to
adhere
to
the
doctrine
of
triplett
v.
lowell.
what
triplett
held
is
that
a
determination
of
invalidity
of
a
patent
in
a
suit
against
one
defendant
does
not
preclude
another
suit
upon
the
same
claims
against
another
defendant.
the
holding
was
on
the
ground
of
the
common
law
requirement
of
mutuality
of
estoppel
as
no
one
can
take
advantage
of
an
earlier
judgment
unless
he
would
also
be
bound
by
it.
now,
the
government’s
interest
in
this
matter
is
on
three
grounds.
the
government
is
a
very
frequent
party
in
patent
litigation.
the
government
has
serious
responsibilities
both
for
conducting
and
administering
the
patent
system
and
for
enforcement
of
the
antitrust
laws
and
of
course
the
government
has
a
great
interest
in
the
courts
and
in
the
fair
and
efficient
administration
of
justice.
now,
if
i
may,
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
summarize
our
views
and
our
position
and
then
to
discuss
the
arguments
for
and
against
the
mutuality
requirement.
during
the
last
approximately
30
years,
the
strict
doctrine
of
mutuality
of
estoppel
has
eroded
very
substantially
both
in
the
federal
courts
and
federal
questions
as
well
as
in
the
state
courts.
until
now,
i
think
it’s
fair
to
say
it
is
no
longer
the
majority
rule
in
the
general
federal
law
and
federal
questions
or
in
our
most
populist
states.
as
matter
fact,
one
new
york
court
of
appeals’
judge
not
to
long
ago
called
mutuality
a
dead
letter
under
the
new
york
law.
however,
in
the
patent
field,
the
lower
courts
have
felt
bound
to
follow
the
doctrine
of
triplett
v.
lowell
and
they
had
adhered
to
the
mutuality
rule
saying
from
time
to
time
that
it
was
up
to
this
court
or
to
the
congress
to
make
any
change
in
the
rule.
this
happened
for
example
in
this
very
case,
in
the
opinion
in
the
seventh
circuit
below,
they
questioned
the
soundness
of
the
rule,
but
indicated
it
had
to
follow
it.
it
happened
a
short
time
ago
in
the
case
of
nickerson
v.
kutschera
in
the
third
circuit
where
the
court
of
appeals
reluctantly
followed
triplett,
reversing
the
delaware
district
court
and
indicating
its
agreement
that
there
should
have
been
an
estoppel.
now,
we
do
not
suggest
abandoning
a
rigid,
strict
mutuality
estoppel
rule
only
to
replace
it
with
another
strict
kind
of
rule
such
as
for
example
in
rem
invalidity
which
apparently
is
the
fear
of
the
patent
bar.
instead,
what
we
suggest
is
a
loosening
of
the
triplett
rule
to
permit
pleading
and
consideration
of
a
prior
invalidity
judgment
as
defense
matter.
the
language
of
triplett
expressly
holds
--
expressly
prohibits
the
pleading
of
a
prior
judgment
in
so
many
words
and
we
think
that
should
not
be.
we
would
like
the
courts
consider
unilateral
estoppel,
if
you
will,
and
consider
such
claims
on
a
case
by
case
basis,
giving
due
weight
and
regard
to
any
factors
that
would
point
to
unfairness
or
to
an
anomalous
result
by
application
of
the
estoppel
doctrine.
now,
turning
to
the
arguments
in
favor
of
abandoning
the
mutuality
requirement,
i
think
that
the
main
argument
is
that
it
serves
no
useful
purpose.
this
criticism
incidentally
goes
as
far
back
as
the
works
of
jeremy
bentham
in
the
middle
of
the
19th
century.
he
found
that
mutuality
served
no
rational
purpose
and
he
said,
“it
was
a
maxim
which
one
would
suppose
to
have
found
its
way
from
the
gaming
table
to
the
bench.”
in
more
recent
times,
in
the
landmark
bernhard
decision,
as
the
supreme
court
of
california
in
1942,
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
traynor.
he
likewise
found
no
rationalization
for
the
rule
and
he
was
unable
to
see
and
he
said
in
the
opinion
by
the
public
policy
values
of
the
res
judicata
doctrine,
the
certainty,
the
finality,
the
limiting
of
litigation,
judicial
economy.
he
could
not
see
why
these
should
fall
before
an
artificial
requirement
of
mutuality.
now,
it
said
that
he
might
have
invoked
the
indemnity
exception
to
this
rule
in
error
and
number
or
exceptions.
in
fact,
i
think
that
in
state
still
following
the
mutuality
rule.
it’s
fair
to
say
it’s
riddled
with
exceptions
and
the
bernhard
case
probably
could
have
gone
off
on
that
ground.
but
instead
justice
traynor
attacked
the
doctrine
in
itself
and
if
in
particular,
he
felt
that
a
estoppel
should
arise
and
should
be
usable
by
a
defendant
against
a
plaintiff
who
had
had
a
full
opportunity
to
try
his
claim
and
had
lost.
as
the
courts,
in
both
federal
and
state
had
followed
bernhard
one
after
another,
it’s
clear
that
the
crowded
condition
of
dockets
and
the
need
for
judicial
economy
has
weighed
heavily
when
the
courts
have
considered
the
artificial
concept
and
the
lack
of
value
to
mutuality
on
the
one
hand
and
weighed
this
other
considerations
against
them.
now,
specifically
in
the
patent
field
the
arguments
against
the
mutuality
i
think
are
primarily
three
in
number.
first,
it’s
argued
that
triplett
gives
a
bad
patent,
almost
as
much
infants
as
a
good
one.
businessmen
except
a
license,
they
pay
a
royalty
to
buy
their
piece
despite
the
fact
that
a
patent
may
once
have
been
held
invalid.
they
do
it
to
buy
their
piece.
to
put
it
another
way,
the
mutuality
doctrine
places
obstacles
in
the
way
of
eliminating
bad
patents.
i
think
it’s
fair
to
say
that
this
would
be
contrary
to
the
policy
stated
by
the
court
in
the
recent
lear
v.
adkins
case.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
would
think
it
is
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
well,
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
think
that
in
view
of
the
fact
that
petitioner
does
asked
that
the
rule
of
the
seventh
circuit
be
upset,
that
it
is
up
to
this
court
to
determine
the
grounds
on
which
it
is
upset
and
to
determine
what
shall
happen
in
the
district
court
if
it
--
the
case
is
remanded
and
it
would
be
our
view
that
the
matter
should
be
remanded
for
the
district
court
to
consider
the
winegard
litigation
and
to
see
what
additional
evidence,
what
hardship,
why
the
district
court
should
not
adhere
to
winegard
rule.
i
don’t
think
that
this
court
is
bound
by
the
grounds
which
the
parties
assert
when
they
come
up
here
and
invoke
the
court’s
power.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
no,
i
sol
understood
him
also
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
this
is
a
little
different
position
than
was
taken
in
his
brief,
but
i
think
it
is
very
close
to
the
position
we
take.
i
think
also
the
brief
amicus
of
the
patent
bar
association
is
not
too
far
from
the
position
we
take.
they
don’t
want
to
see
a
new
rigid
in
rem
invalidity
kind
of
rule
established
and
neither
do
we.
we
are
not
suggesting
that
there
should
be
a
one
shop
and
that
is
all
kind
of
situation.
we
recognize
some
of
these
arguments
that
are
made
pro
and
con.
we
think
that
the
court
is
the
place.
the
courts
are
the
instrument
for
carrying
out
a
reconsideration
of
triplett
in
a
cautious,
case
by
case
and
step
by
step
basis.
i
would
advert
to
the
considerations
set
forth
in
rule
60
for
a
new
trial.
i
think
they
list
newly
discovered
evidence,
fraud
or
perjury,
some
sort
of
misconduct
by
the
other
side,
and
then
i
think
it
winds
up
with
the
statement,
any
other
matter
that
is
necessary
for
fairness
and
justice
and
we
would
suggest
to
similar
rule
in
these
cases.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
think
mr.
justice
harlan
that
the
court
would
be
warranted
at
least
in
reexamining
that
portion
of
triplett
which
says
that
a
defendant
may
not
plead
as
a
defense,
i
think
there
is
almost
direct
quote
the
fact
of
prior
litigation.
i
think
that
the
court
should
follow
the
trend,
the
modern
trend
in
the
courts,
it
should
release
the
lower
courts
who
apparently
feel
bound
to
follow
the
triplett
rule
in
a
rather
complete
fashion
despite
their
own
ideas
of
what
would
be
fair
in
the
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
would
think
mr.
justice
harlan
that
the
situation
in
the
courts
now
considering
the
crowded
dockets,
considering
the
techno-graft
litigation
which
i
now
--
i
understand
now
numbers
some
70
cases
in
20
districts
and
more
than
200
defendants.
i
think
that
it
would
be
well
if
the
court
could
see
its
way
clear
to
giving
consideration
to
this
matter.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
i
it
was
up
in
congress
in
a
bill
two
years
ago
as
a
result
of
recommendation
of
presidential
patent
commission
and
it
was
suggested
at
that
time
that
a
kind
of
an
in
rem
invalidity
rule
be
adopted.
that
bill
was
not
reintroduced
in
the
last
congress
and
the
provisions
in
the
current
patent,
well,
i
guess
that
bill
has
not
yet
been
re-offered
but
it
was
in
the
last
congress
had
to
with
the
payment
of
costs
and
i
believe
counsel
fees
where
a
party
has
unjustifiably
brought
a
second
or
more
later
litigation.
but
i
would
say
that
the
congress
has
given
no
indication
either
of
approval
or
disapproval
of
the
triplett
rule.
the
triplett
rule
is
i
think
part
of
what
the
court
saw
in
1936
as
the
general
common
law
on
the
subject
of
estoppel
by
judgment
and
i
think
that
the
other
parts
of
the
law
having
changed,
it’s
appropriate
for
the
court
to
develop
the
changes
insofar
as
they
apply
in
the
patent
field.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
would
say,
it
rests
all
together
on
what
was
then
the
generally
accepted
common
law
rule
mr.
justice
black,
yes.
well,
just
to
conclude
the
arguments
are
set
forth
in
our
brief
in
favor
of
overruling
the
mutuality
doctrine.
the
other
parties,
university
of
illinois
particularly
some
of
the
amicus
briefs
indicate
the
arguments
in
favor
of
mutuality
doctrine.
our
conclusion
recognizing
that
there
are
important
questions
raised,
we
think
in
balance
that
a
clear
case
has
been
made
for
reconsideration
of
triplett.
it
was
based
on
the
general
common
law
when
it
was
decided.
that
law
is
now
changed
and
we
do
not
think
that
triplett
is
serving
us
so
well
that
it
should
be
retained
as
an
exception
to
what
we
regard
as
the
modern
rule
and
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
would
think
mr.
justice
black
that
it
would
be
reversed,
remanded
to
the
trial
court
to
consider
the
winegard
litigation
and
what
additional
evidence
the
university
of
illinois
would
have
to
offer
to
change
that
ruling.
and
if
it
cannot
make
out
a
case
for
a
further
trial,
make
out
a
case
as
to
why
it
didn’t
present
dr.
duhamel’s
testimony
for
example
on
the
first
trial
then
i
would
think
that
the
trial
judge
should
adhere
to
it.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
he
was
referring
to
his
counterclaim
that
--
where
he
said
he
wanted
his
full
trial
and
i
think
that
judge
hoffman
had
dismissed
his
counterclaim
on
his
patent
without
findings
on
the
obviousness
issue.
i
believe
that
was
what
was
referred
to.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
yes.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
read
that
to
mean
that,
but
for
the
triplett
rule
would
have
followed
the
eighth
circuit,
justice
stewart.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
think
they
went
on
to
cite
it
and
another
justice
in
that
circuit
just
a
few
years
ago
found
the
doctrine
abhorrent
in
light
of
the
crowded
condition
of
the
dockets
out
there.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
and
i
venture
to
say
that
they
would
follow
a
unilateral
estoppel
rule
of
the
kind
that
we
have
outlined
which
would
always
be
subject
to
a
fairness
doctrine.
we
do
not
suggest
any
kind
of
a
rigid
per
se
or
in
rem
rule.
i
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
appears
as
amicus
in
this
matter
today
solely
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
or
to
what
extent
the
court
should
continue
to
adhere
to
the
doctrine
of
triplett
v.
lowell.
what
triplett
held
is
that
a
determination
of
invalidity
of
a
patent
in
a
suit
against
one
defendant
does
not
preclude
another
suit
upon
the
same
claims
against
another
defendant.
the
holding
was
on
the
ground
of
the
common
law
requirement
of
mutuality
of
estoppel
as
no
one
can
take
advantage
of
an
earlier
judgment
unless
he
would
also
be
bound
by
it.
now,
the
government’s
interest
in
this
matter
is
on
three
grounds.
the
government
is
a
very
frequent
party
in
patent
litigation.
the
government
has
serious
responsibilities
both
for
conducting
and
administering
the
patent
system
and
for
enforcement
of
the
antitrust
laws
and
of
course
the
government
has
a
great
interest
in
the
courts
and
in
the
fair
and
efficient
administration
of
justice.
now,
if
i
may,
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
summarize
our
views
and
our
position
and
then
to
discuss
the
arguments
for
and
against
the
mutuality
requirement.
during
the
last
approximately
30
years,
the
strict
doctrine
of
mutuality
of
estoppel
has
eroded
very
substantially
both
in
the
federal
courts
and
federal
questions
as
well
as
in
the
state
courts.
until
now,
i
think
it’s
fair
to
say
it
is
no
longer
the
majority
rule
in
the
general
federal
law
and
federal
questions
or
in
our
most
populist
states.
as
matter
fact,
one
new
york
court
of
appeals’
judge
not
to
long
ago
called
mutuality
a
dead
letter
under
the
new
york
law.
however,
in
the
patent
field,
the
lower
courts
have
felt
bound
to
follow
the
doctrine
of
triplett
v.
lowell
and
they
had
adhered
to
the
mutuality
rule
saying
from
time
to
time
that
it
was
up
to
this
court
or
to
the
congress
to
make
any
change
in
the
rule.
this
happened
for
example
in
this
very
case,
in
the
opinion
in
the
seventh
circuit
below,
they
questioned
the
soundness
of
the
rule,
but
indicated
it
had
to
follow
it.
it
happened
a
short
time
ago
in
the
case
of
nickerson
v.
kutschera
in
the
third
circuit
where
the
court
of
appeals
reluctantly
followed
triplett,
reversing
the
delaware
district
court
and
indicating
its
agreement
that
there
should
have
been
an
estoppel.
now,
we
do
not
suggest
abandoning
a
rigid,
strict
mutuality
estoppel
rule
only
to
replace
it
with
another
strict
kind
of
rule
such
as
for
example
in
rem
invalidity
which
apparently
is
the
fear
of
the
patent
bar.
instead,
what
we
suggest
is
a
loosening
of
the
triplett
rule
to
permit
pleading
and
consideration
of
a
prior
invalidity
judgment
as
defense
matter.
the
language
of
triplett
expressly
holds
--
expressly
prohibits
the
pleading
of
a
prior
judgment
in
so
many
words
and
we
think
that
should
not
be.
we
would
like
the
courts
consider
unilateral
estoppel,
if
you
will,
and
consider
such
claims
on
a
case
by
case
basis,
giving
due
weight
and
regard
to
any
factors
that
would
point
to
unfairness
or
to
an
anomalous
result
by
application
of
the
estoppel
doctrine.
now,
turning
to
the
arguments
in
favor
of
abandoning
the
mutuality
requirement,
i
think
that
the
main
argument
is
that
it
serves
no
useful
purpose.
this
criticism
incidentally
goes
as
far
back
as
the
works
of
jeremy
bentham
in
the
middle
of
the
19th
century.
he
found
that
mutuality
served
no
rational
purpose
and
he
said,
“it
was
a
maxim
which
one
would
suppose
to
have
found
its
way
from
the
gaming
table
to
the
bench.”
in
more
recent
times,
in
the
landmark
bernhard
decision,
as
the
supreme
court
of
california
in
1942,
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
traynor.
he
likewise
found
no
rationalization
for
the
rule
and
he
was
unable
to
see
and
he
said
in
the
opinion
by
the
public
policy
values
of
the
res
judicata
doctrine,
the
certainty,
the
finality,
the
limiting
of
litigation,
judicial
economy.
he
could
not
see
why
these
should
fall
before
an
artificial
requirement
of
mutuality.
now,
it
said
that
he
might
have
invoked
the
indemnity
exception
to
this
rule
in
error
and
number
or
exceptions.
in
fact,
i
think
that
in
state
still
following
the
mutuality
rule.
it’s
fair
to
say
it’s
riddled
with
exceptions
and
the
bernhard
case
probably
could
have
gone
off
on
that
ground.
but
instead
justice
traynor
attacked
the
doctrine
in
itself
and
if
in
particular,
he
felt
that
a
estoppel
should
arise
and
should
be
usable
by
a
defendant
against
a
plaintiff
who
had
had
a
full
opportunity
to
try
his
claim
and
had
lost.
as
the
courts,
in
both
federal
and
state
had
followed
bernhard
one
after
another,
it’s
clear
that
the
crowded
condition
of
dockets
and
the
need
for
judicial
economy
has
weighed
heavily
when
the
courts
have
considered
the
artificial
concept
and
the
lack
of
value
to
mutuality
on
the
one
hand
and
weighed
this
other
considerations
against
them.
now,
specifically
in
the
patent
field
the
arguments
against
the
mutuality
i
think
are
primarily
three
in
number.
first,
it’s
argued
that
triplett
gives
a
bad
patent,
almost
as
much
infants
as
a
good
one.
businessmen
except
a
license,
they
pay
a
royalty
to
buy
their
piece
despite
the
fact
that
a
patent
may
once
have
been
held
invalid.
they
do
it
to
buy
their
piece.
to
put
it
another
way,
the
mutuality
doctrine
places
obstacles
in
the
way
of
eliminating
bad
patents.
i
think
it’s
fair
to
say
that
this
would
be
contrary
to
the
policy
stated
by
the
court
in
the
recent
lear
v.
adkins
case.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
would
think
it
is
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
well,
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
think
that
in
view
of
the
fact
that
petitioner
does
asked
that
the
rule
of
the
seventh
circuit
be
upset,
that
it
is
up
to
this
court
to
determine
the
grounds
on
which
it
is
upset
and
to
determine
what
shall
happen
in
the
district
court
if
it
--
the
case
is
remanded
and
it
would
be
our
view
that
the
matter
should
be
remanded
for
the
district
court
to
consider
the
winegard
litigation
and
to
see
what
additional
evidence,
what
hardship,
why
the
district
court
should
not
adhere
to
winegard
rule.
i
don’t
think
that
this
court
is
bound
by
the
grounds
which
the
parties
assert
when
they
come
up
here
and
invoke
the
court’s
power.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
no,
i
sol
understood
him
also
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
this
is
a
little
different
position
than
was
taken
in
his
brief,
but
i
think
it
is
very
close
to
the
position
we
take.
i
think
also
the
brief
amicus
of
the
patent
bar
association
is
not
too
far
from
the
position
we
take.
they
don’t
want
to
see
a
new
rigid
in
rem
invalidity
kind
of
rule
established
and
neither
do
we.
we
are
not
suggesting
that
there
should
be
a
one
shop
and
that
is
all
kind
of
situation.
we
recognize
some
of
these
arguments
that
are
made
pro
and
con.
we
think
that
the
court
is
the
place.
the
courts
are
the
instrument
for
carrying
out
a
reconsideration
of
triplett
in
a
cautious,
case
by
case
and
step
by
step
basis.
i
would
advert
to
the
considerations
set
forth
in
rule
60
for
a
new
trial.
i
think
they
list
newly
discovered
evidence,
fraud
or
perjury,
some
sort
of
misconduct
by
the
other
side,
and
then
i
think
it
winds
up
with
the
statement,
any
other
matter
that
is
necessary
for
fairness
and
justice
and
we
would
suggest
to
similar
rule
in
these
cases.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
think
mr.
justice
harlan
that
the
court
would
be
warranted
at
least
in
reexamining
that
portion
of
triplett
which
says
that
a
defendant
may
not
plead
as
a
defense,
i
think
there
is
almost
direct
quote
the
fact
of
prior
litigation.
i
think
that
the
court
should
follow
the
trend,
the
modern
trend
in
the
courts,
it
should
release
the
lower
courts
who
apparently
feel
bound
to
follow
the
triplett
rule
in
a
rather
complete
fashion
despite
their
own
ideas
of
what
would
be
fair
in
the
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
would
think
mr.
justice
harlan
that
the
situation
in
the
courts
now
considering
the
crowded
dockets,
considering
the
techno-graft
litigation
which
i
now
--
i
understand
now
numbers
some
70
cases
in
20
districts
and
more
than
200
defendants.
i
think
that
it
would
be
well
if
the
court
could
see
its
way
clear
to
giving
consideration
to
this
matter.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
i
it
was
up
in
congress
in
a
bill
two
years
ago
as
a
result
of
recommendation
of
presidential
patent
commission
and
it
was
suggested
at
that
time
that
a
kind
of
an
in
rem
invalidity
rule
be
adopted.
that
bill
was
not
reintroduced
in
the
last
congress
and
the
provisions
in
the
current
patent,
well,
i
guess
that
bill
has
not
yet
been
re-offered
but
it
was
in
the
last
congress
had
to
with
the
payment
of
costs
and
i
believe
counsel
fees
where
a
party
has
unjustifiably
brought
a
second
or
more
later
litigation.
but
i
would
say
that
the
congress
has
given
no
indication
either
of
approval
or
disapproval
of
the
triplett
rule.
the
triplett
rule
is
i
think
part
of
what
the
court
saw
in
1936
as
the
general
common
law
on
the
subject
of
estoppel
by
judgment
and
i
think
that
the
other
parts
of
the
law
having
changed,
it’s
appropriate
for
the
court
to
develop
the
changes
insofar
as
they
apply
in
the
patent
field.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
would
say,
it
rests
all
together
on
what
was
then
the
generally
accepted
common
law
rule
mr.
justice
black,
yes.
well,
just
to
conclude
the
arguments
are
set
forth
in
our
brief
in
favor
of
overruling
the
mutuality
doctrine.
the
other
parties,
university
of
illinois
particularly
some
of
the
amicus
briefs
indicate
the
arguments
in
favor
of
mutuality
doctrine.
our
conclusion
recognizing
that
there
are
important
questions
raised,
we
think
in
balance
that
a
clear
case
has
been
made
for
reconsideration
of
triplett.
it
was
based
on
the
general
common
law
when
it
was
decided.
that
law
is
now
changed
and
we
do
not
think
that
triplett
is
serving
us
so
well
that
it
should
be
retained
as
an
exception
to
what
we
regard
as
the
modern
rule
and
--
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
would
think
mr.
justice
black
that
it
would
be
reversed,
remanded
to
the
trial
court
to
consider
the
winegard
litigation
and
what
additional
evidence
the
university
of
illinois
would
have
to
offer
to
change
that
ruling.
and
if
it
cannot
make
out
a
case
for
a
further
trial,
make
out
a
case
as
to
why
it
didn’t
present
dr.
duhamel’s
testimony
for
example
on
the
first
trial
then
i
would
think
that
the
trial
judge
should
adhere
to
it.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
he
was
referring
to
his
counterclaim
that
--
where
he
said
he
wanted
his
full
trial
and
i
think
that
judge
hoffman
had
dismissed
his
counterclaim
on
his
patent
without
findings
on
the
obviousness
issue.
i
believe
that
was
what
was
referred
to.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
yes.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
read
that
to
mean
that,
but
for
the
triplett
rule
would
have
followed
the
eighth
circuit,
justice
stewart.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
i
think
they
went
on
to
cite
it
and
another
justice
in
that
circuit
just
a
few
years
ago
found
the
doctrine
abhorrent
in
light
of
the
crowded
condition
of
the
dockets
out
there.
mr.
richard
w.
mclaren
and
i
venture
to
say
that
they
would
follow
a
unilateral
estoppel
rule
of
the
kind
that
we
have
outlined
which
would
always
be
subject
to
a
fairness
doctrine.
we
do
not
suggest
any
kind
of
a
rigid
per
se
or
in
rem
rule.
i
thank
you,
your
honor.
