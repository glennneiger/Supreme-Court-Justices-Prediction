you're
not
asking
for

to
be
overruled?
justice
john
m.

well,
you
better
address
yourself
to
publication
issue.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
ms.
johnson’s
operations?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
would
you
characterize
in
the
laws
it’s
just
the
lower
court
as
to
what
standard
of
publication
is?
justice
john
m.
harlan
of
course
mclaren,
you're
making
your
argument
which
might
give
conflicts
in
the
case
with
the
parties
of
both
sides
of
this
case
as
in
adkins
and
triplett.
i
suppose
res
judicata
is
a
defense
in

justice
john
m.
harlan
but
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
the
context
of
the
litigation
for
both
sides
or
at
the
least
the
party
to
benefit
the
doctrine
could
be
invoke
as
to
where
it
is
not
a
very
happy
situation
that
needs
to
be
considered
in
the
decision
of
this
court.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
nevertheless,
in
view
of
the
position
of
the
parties,
at
least
as
taken
in
their
briefs,
what
you’re
suggesting
we
do
is
sua
sponte
ourselves
to
overrule
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
(inaudible)
without
argument
by
the
court?
justice
john
m.
harlan
why
do
a
litigation
in
which
that
issue
is
put
to
us
by
the
parties?

what
interested
me,

those
documents
which
are
