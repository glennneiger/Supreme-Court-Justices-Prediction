mr.
sidney
g.
faber
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
of
the
three
questions
presented
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
namely
the
validity
of
the
isbell
patent
because
it
provided
decisions,
secondly
the
so
called
fraud
and
the
strictures
on
jfd
for
utilizing
certain
patent
legends,
and
certain
patents
in
furthering
its
sales
and
three,
the
re-invocation
of
graham
against
deere
because
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
had
said
that
the
district
court
had
not
itself
fully
followed
the
formula,
and
set
down
in
graham
against
deere
with
respect
to
holdings
of
obviousness.
jfd
is
of
course
primarily
interested
in
number
three
where
jfd
is
charged
with
patent
infringement.
number
two,
where
jfd
is
charged
with
unfair
competition
by
itself
and
in
cahoots
with
the
very
good
–
the
university
of
illinois
and
of
course
jfd
is
a
licensee
under
the
isbell
patent.
now,
the
blonder
patent
was
brought
into
this
court
on
question
three,
when
--
question
three
as
raised
in
the
petition
which
was
granted
by
this
court
asked
by
the
requirements
in
the
district
court,
the
due
process
and
specific
findings
underlying
the
determination
of
obviousness
in
patent
causes
as
laid
down
by
the
supreme
court
in
graham
against
deere
mandatory
or
just
optional
and
ignorable.
this
question
cited
the
strictures
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
trial
judge,
which
had
said
the
district
court
did
not
describe
the
scope
and
content
of
the
prior
art,
identified
the
differences
between
the
prior
art
and
claimed
no
stake
at
the
level
of
ordinary
skill
in
the
prior
art,
something
that
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
did
do.
however,
we
did
not
get
the
whole
story
in
the
petition,
nor
do
we
get
the
whole
story
in
the
brief
filed
by
the
petitioner
in
which
the
petitioner
says,
page
63,
the
mere
conclusion
by
the
district
court
that
claim
five
of
the
blonder-tongue
patent
was
obvious
at
the
time
it
was
made
and
is
therefore
invalid
“is
entirely
unsupported
by
any
special
or
subsidiary
facts.”
the
fact
this
however,
that,
that
appearance
of
that
one
sentence
all
by
itself
in
the
brief
of
the
petitioner
is
the
first
sentence
of
a
two-sentence
paragraph.
and
the
second
sentence
of
that
two
sentence
paragraph
by
judge
hoffman
on
page
89
of
the
record
says,
“the
alleged
improvement
was
thwart
by
the
following
references
in
the
prior
art,
one
technical
point
number
52,
two
the
mayes
and
his
(inaudible)
the
prior
art
patent
cited.
they
used
the
word
obvious
in
that
one
sentence
which
i
had
read
first
and
then
he
said
it
was
thwart
by
technical
report
number
52.
the
court
of
appeals
seventh
circuit
as
i
pointed
out
said
they
really
wished
that
the
trial
judge
had
applied
the
rulings,
the
formula
prescribed
in
graham
against
deere,
and
then
it
itself
tried
to
follow
its
own
rulings
and
it
ended
up
by
saying,
page
70
of
the
record,
“if
we
understand
its
position
correctly”,
this
is
the
court
of
appeals
talking,
“blonder-tongue
places
chief
reliance
on
the
fact
that
while
isbell
teaches
that
the
two
planes
in
which
the
dipole
elements
lie
are
to
be
close
enough
together,
that
the
dipoles
are
substantially
coplanar.
blonder
teaches
that
the
planes
maybe
separated
by
some
distance,
but
less
than
the
wavelength
of
the
band.”
and
the
court
of
appeals
went
on,
“a
substantial
separation
of
these
planes
is
clearly
shown,
however,
in
the
1961
publication
cited
by
the
court,
that's
quite
below.
technical
report
number
52
of
the
internal
laboratories,
that's
at
the
university
of
illinois.
so
that
we
have
certain
circuits
saying
to
judge
hoffman,
thou
has
not
followed
the
rules
of
graham
against
deere
and
then
saying,
but
we
apply
the
--
we
do
exactly
the
same
thing
judge
hoffman
did.
we
find
that
technical
report
number
52
does
the
job
in
toto.
now,
where
will
you
have,
as
you
know
your
honors,
section
102
of
patent
act
says
that
if
the
invention
is
described
in
another
printed
publication,
it
may
not
be
patent
then.
section
103
says
that
if
it
is
obvious
from
one
or
more
prior
patents
in
publications
then
on
a
showing
that,
that
was
beyond
the
standing
of
ordinary
skill,
it
maybe
patented.
and
graham
against
deere
pointed
out
that
when
you
are
going
to
use
103,
then
as
an
appropriate
administration
of
justice,
so
that
the
decision
can
be
understood,
please
explain.
and
this
court
itself
gave
an
example
of
such
explanation
in
a
later
case,
anderson
--
i
fully
believe
that
the
anderson-black
rock
inc.
against
pavement
salvage
co
inc.
was
decided
by
this
court
in
the
way
it
was
--
they
set
forth
a
very
succinct
and
complete
example
of
what
the
court
wanted
when
it
said
in
graham
against
deere,
that
laid
down
the
rules
that
the
various
other
courts
would
follow
because
this
particular
case
there.
now,
when
we
turn
however
to
the
patent
itself,
and
i
asked
those
of
you
who
are
able
to
do
so,
to
turn
to
page
39
of
this
yellow
book,
the
supplemental
appendix
where
you'll
find
a
reproduction
of
an
exhibit
that
wasn't
produced
until
the
--
at
the
trial.
this
reproduction
shows
on
the
left
side
principal
drawing
of
the
blonder-tongue
patent.
in
the
middle,
the
claim
5,
which
is
the
only
claim
blonder-tongue
has
brought
to
this
court,
and
on
the
left
side
there
is
technical
report
number
52
that
had
been
referred
to
by
judge
hoffman
and
had
been
referred
to
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
of
course
this
chart
draws
a
relationship
between
the
claim
and
each
of
the
two
disclosures,
blonder-tongue
and
the
technical
report.
and
you
find
that
i
don't
want
a
pair
of
rigid
longitudinal
conductors
held
spaced
to
predetermined
vertical
distance
apart
in
a
vertical
plain,
is
found
in
blonder-tongue
of
course,
that's
where
the
claim
comes
from,
it
is
found
in
this
technical
report
number
52
which
has
been
published
early
enough
to
be
a
reference,
there
is
no
question
there.
first
and
second
pluralities
of
dipole
elements
lying
in
corresponding
first
and
second
vertically
spaced
horizontal
plains
containing
the
respective
conductors,
it's
there.
right
down
the
line,
the
spacing,
the
dipoles
in
separate
plains,
they
are
all
there
in
each
of
these
two
things
except
one
is
a
publication
antedating
the
filing
date
of
the
patent
about
more
than
a
year,
and
the
other
is
the
patent
itself.
however,
you'll
notice
in
this
chart,
on
item
floor
array,
instead
of
being
able
to
put
in
the
statement
that
yes,
this
particular
strain
relief
appears
in
technical
report
number
52,
we
ought
to
say
no,
but
and
we
went
to
two
references
and
let
me
explain
a
strain
relief
very,
very
briefly
in
the
simplest
terms.
when
i
have
to
change
the
electric
plug
in
the
toaster
in
my
kitchen,
and
knowing
that
my
wife
may
well
pull
that
plug
out
by
the
cord
rather
than
by
the
plug,
that
will
tie
a
knot
in
the
wire
entering
the
hole
in
the
plug
before
i
connect
those
two
wires
to
the
screws
on
that
plug,
and
now
if
that
plug
is
pulled
by
the
wire
rather
than
by
the
plug,
that
knot
that
has
been
tied
in
the
wire
will
bear
against
the
hole
and
we
won't
be
pulling
the
contacts
out.
so
this
strain
relief
is
something
that
has
existed
from
many
years.
blonder,
who
is
one
of
the
co-inventors
here
testified
that
the
strain
relief
specifically
had
existed
from
many,
many
years.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
blonder
admitted
that
all
the
other
mechanical
elements
were
old
but
the
only
sum
total
of
all
the
other
mechanical
elements
in
this
claim
5
is
this
one
item.
blonder
also
testified
and
by
the
way,
petitioner's
brief
makes
much
of
the
fact
that
blonder
is
a
master
of
science
type
of
person.
blonder
is
of
course
the
moving
spirit
in
the
petitioner,
blonder
himself
testified
not
only
as
an
expert,
but
also
testified
that
the
ranger
3
antenna
put
out
by
blonder
was
made
in
accordance
with
claim
5
which
is
the
only
claim
at
issue
in
this
patent.
so
when
we
look
at
the
ranger
3
antenna,
which
by
coincidence
happens
to
be
not
exactly
coincidence,
i
must
confess,
happens
to
be
opposite
page
40
of
the
same
yellow
book.
the
ranger
3
antenna
does
not
provide
a
strain
relief
or
a
means
of
anchoring
that
lead
in
on
the
antenna.
so
on
page
2
of
the
brochure
that
goes
along
with
the
ranger
3,
on
second
page,
bottom
of
the
first
column,
there
is
an
instruction
to
the
installer,
lab
electricians
tapper
around
standoff
as
indicated
by
the
dotted
lines
in
b.
so
the
strain
relief
isn't
on
the
antenna
when
it
is
sold.
the
standoff
shown
up
there
at
the
upper-right
on
page
2b
is
a
means
of
supporting
or
spacing
the
lead-in
from
the
vertical
mass,
and
the
vertical
mass
is
not
the
antenna.
the
antenna
sits
on
the
vertical
mass,
and
this
ranger
3,
which
according
to
mr.
blonder
was
made
in
accordance
with
claim
5
of
his
patent,
that
is
so
without
this
strain
relief,
but
sold
within
an
instruction,
put
some
tape
around
this
bottom.
so
when
judge
hoffman
said,
in
the
second
sentence
of
that
paragraph
i
read
to
you,
when
judge
hoffman
said
that
it
is
thwart,
that
was
the
end
of
it.
he
is
either
right
or
wrong,
and
having
said
it
is
thwart
by
technical
board-52,
if
it
is
thwart,
perhaps
he
might
have
said,
yes,
just
while
looked
at
a
picture
of
myself,
said,
yes,
it's
got
a
nose,
yeah,
it's
got
two
eyes,
yes,
it
has
hair,
not
too
much
hair.
but,
when
he
says
it's
thwart,
he
is
making
a
statement
and
when
you
take
--
when
in
a
later
case
or
another
judge
should
want
to
see
what
the
basis
for
the
decision
was
and
simply
gets
a
xerox
copy
of
that
reference.
and
when
the
court
of
appeals
said
it
is
thwart
except
for
some
mechanical
elements
which
blonder
admitted
to
be
old,
those
mechanical
elements
added
up
to
all
of
that
single
unit,
the
strain
relief.
now,
i
have
a
few
seconds
left.
in
considering
question
number
2,
the
charges
of
fraud,
what
nasty
people
jfd
was,
how
jfd
either
let
the
illinois,
university
of
illinois
down
the
garden
path,
the
vis-a-vis,
i
don't
know,
just
keep
in
mind
that
when
you
read
these
charges,
every
single
one
of
them
is
an
allegation
and
every
single
one
of
them
without
a
single
exception
is
not
supported
by
proof.
in
the
time
left
to
me,
let
me
just
take
up
a
few
of
them.
number
1,
jfd
raided
the
blonder-tongue
employees.
in
the
period
that
jfd
was
supposed
to
have
raided
the
blonder-tongue
employees,
stolen
them
all
away,
100
employees
left
blonder-tongue,
5
of
those
who
had
left
came
to
jfd.
when
mr.
blonder
was
asked
to
list
all
of
the
antenna
manufacturers,
i
think
he
was
able
to
list
six
or
seven,
maybe
there
are
10
or
12
or
15
throughout
the
country,
and
why
did
as
many
as
fired,
120
of
those
who
left
come
to
jfd.
well,
blonder-tongue
is
located
in
new
york,
jfd
is
located
in
brooklyn,
and
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
not
too
many
people
want
to
live
in
new
york,
i
am
sorry,
mr.
justice
brennan,
[laughter]
and
not
too
many
people
want
to
live
in
brooklyn,
and
when
somebody
is
living
in
westchester,
on
long
island,
he
can
commute
almost
as
inconveniently
to
either
place.
in
other
words,
there
was
proximity,
and
we've
got
--
and
jfd
got
120
of
those
who
left.
mr.
ballash
(ph),
blonder
says
was
given
the
job
of
keeping
tabs
on
jfd.
not
only
keeping
tabs
on
jfd,
he
was
supposed
to
be
really
fully
in
charge
according
to
the
allegations
of
the
whole
antenna
division
of
blonder.
the
general
manager
of
blonder-tongue
testified
that
mr.
ballash
was
a
very
angry
man
who
left
--
who
complained
for
many
years
was
reduced
gradually
in
rank
and
finally
left
two
years
--
a-year-and-a-half
before
the
trial.
thank
you.
mr.
sidney
g.
faber
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
of
the
three
questions
presented
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
namely
the
validity
of
the
isbell
patent
because
it
provided
decisions,
secondly
the
so
called
fraud
and
the
strictures
on
jfd
for
utilizing
certain
patent
legends,
and
certain
patents
in
furthering
its
sales
and
three,
the
re-invocation
of
graham
against
deere
because
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
had
said
that
the
district
court
had
not
itself
fully
followed
the
formula,
and
set
down
in
graham
against
deere
with
respect
to
holdings
of
obviousness.
jfd
is
of
course
primarily
interested
in
number
three
where
jfd
is
charged
with
patent
infringement.
number
two,
where
jfd
is
charged
with
unfair
competition
by
itself
and
in
cahoots
with
the
very
good
–
the
university
of
illinois
and
of
course
jfd
is
a
licensee
under
the
isbell
patent.
now,
the
blonder
patent
was
brought
into
this
court
on
question
three,
when
--
question
three
as
raised
in
the
petition
which
was
granted
by
this
court
asked
by
the
requirements
in
the
district
court,
the
due
process
and
specific
findings
underlying
the
determination
of
obviousness
in
patent
causes
as
laid
down
by
the
supreme
court
in
graham
against
deere
mandatory
or
just
optional
and
ignorable.
this
question
cited
the
strictures
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
trial
judge,
which
had
said
the
district
court
did
not
describe
the
scope
and
content
of
the
prior
art,
identified
the
differences
between
the
prior
art
and
claimed
no
stake
at
the
level
of
ordinary
skill
in
the
prior
art,
something
that
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
did
do.
however,
we
did
not
get
the
whole
story
in
the
petition,
nor
do
we
get
the
whole
story
in
the
brief
filed
by
the
petitioner
in
which
the
petitioner
says,
page
63,
the
mere
conclusion
by
the
district
court
that
claim
five
of
the
blonder-tongue
patent
was
obvious
at
the
time
it
was
made
and
is
therefore
invalid
“is
entirely
unsupported
by
any
special
or
subsidiary
facts.”
the
fact
this
however,
that,
that
appearance
of
that
one
sentence
all
by
itself
in
the
brief
of
the
petitioner
is
the
first
sentence
of
a
two-sentence
paragraph.
and
the
second
sentence
of
that
two
sentence
paragraph
by
judge
hoffman
on
page
89
of
the
record
says,
“the
alleged
improvement
was
thwart
by
the
following
references
in
the
prior
art,
one
technical
point
number
52,
two
the
mayes
and
his
(inaudible)
the
prior
art
patent
cited.
they
used
the
word
obvious
in
that
one
sentence
which
i
had
read
first
and
then
he
said
it
was
thwart
by
technical
report
number
52.
the
court
of
appeals
seventh
circuit
as
i
pointed
out
said
they
really
wished
that
the
trial
judge
had
applied
the
rulings,
the
formula
prescribed
in
graham
against
deere,
and
then
it
itself
tried
to
follow
its
own
rulings
and
it
ended
up
by
saying,

of
the
record,
“if
we
understand
its
position
correctly”,
this
is
the
court
of
appeals
talking,
“blonder-tongue
places
chief
reliance
on
the
fact
that
while
isbell
teaches
that
the
two
planes
in
which
the
dipole
elements
lie
are
to
be
close
enough
together,
that
the
dipoles
are
substantially
coplanar.
blonder
teaches
that
the
planes
maybe
separated
by
some
distance,
but
less
than
the
wavelength
of
the
band.”
and
the
court
of
appeals
went
on,
“a
substantial
separation
of
these
planes
is
clearly
shown,
however,
in
the
1961
publication
cited
by
the
court,
that's
quite
below.
technical
report
number
52
of
the
internal
laboratories,
that's
at
the
university
of
illinois.
so
that
we
have
certain
circuits
saying
to
judge
hoffman,
thou
has
not
followed
the
rules
of
graham
against
deere
and
then
saying,
but
we
apply
the
--
we
do
exactly
the
same
thing
judge
hoffman
did.
we
find
that
technical
report
number
52
does
the
job
in
toto.
now,
where
will
you
have,
as
you
know
your
honors,
section
102
of
patent
act
says
that
if
the
invention
is
described
in
another
printed
publication,
it
may
not
be
patent
then.
section
103
says
that
if
it
is
obvious
from
one
or
more
prior
patents
in
publications
then
on
a
showing
that,
that
was
beyond
the
standing
of
ordinary
skill,
it
maybe
patented.
and
graham
against
deere
pointed
out
that
when
you
are
going
to
use
103,
then
as
an
appropriate
administration
of
justice,
so
that
the
decision
can
be
understood,
please
explain.
and
this
court
itself
gave
an
example
of
such
explanation
in
a
later
case,
anderson
--
i
fully
believe
that
the
anderson-black
rock
inc.
against
pavement
salvage
co
inc.
was
decided
by
this
court
in
the
way
it
was
--
they
set
forth
a
very
succinct
and
complete
example
of
what
the
court
wanted
when
it
said
in
graham
against
deere,
that
laid
down
the
rules
that
the
various
other
courts
would
follow
because
this
particular
case
there.
now,
when
we
turn
however
to
the
patent
itself,
and
i
asked
those
of
you
who
are
able
to
do
so,
to
turn
to
page
39
of
this
yellow
book,
the
supplemental
appendix
where
you'll
find
a
reproduction
of
an
exhibit
that
wasn't
produced
until
the
--
at
the
trial.
this
reproduction
shows
on
the
left
side
principal
drawing
of
the
blonder-tongue
patent.
in
the
middle,
the
claim
5,
which
is
the
only
claim
blonder-tongue
has
brought
to
this
court,
and
on
the
left
side
there
is
technical
report
number
52
that
had
been
referred
to
by
judge
hoffman
and
had
been
referred
to
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
of
course
this
chart
draws
a
relationship
between
the
claim
and
each
of
the
two
disclosures,
blonder-tongue
and
the
technical
report.
and
you
find
that
i
don't
want
a
pair
of
rigid
longitudinal
conductors
held
spaced
to
predetermined
vertical
distance
apart
in
a
vertical
plain,
is
found
in
blonder-tongue
of
course,
that's
where
the
claim
comes
from,
it
is
found
in
this
technical
report
number
52
which
has
been
published
early
enough
to
be
a
reference,
there
is
no
question
there.
first
and
second
pluralities
of
dipole
elements
lying
in
corresponding
first
and
second
vertically
spaced
horizontal
plains
containing
the
respective
conductors,
it's
there.
right
down
the
line,
the
spacing,
the
dipoles
in
separate
plains,
they
are
all
there
in
each
of
these
two
things
except
one
is
a
publication
antedating
the
filing
date
of
the
patent
about
more
than
a
year,
and
the
other
is
the
patent
itself.
however,
you'll
notice
in
this
chart,
on
item
floor
array,
instead
of
being
able
to
put
in
the
statement
that
yes,
this
particular
strain
relief
appears
in
technical
report
number
52,
we
ought
to
say
no,
but
and
we
went
to
two
references
and
let
me
explain
a
strain
relief
very,
very
briefly
in
the
simplest
terms.
when
i
have
to
change
the
electric
plug
in
the
toaster
in
my
kitchen,
and
knowing
that
my
wife
may
well
pull
that
plug
out
by
the
cord
rather
than
by
the
plug,
that
will
tie
a
knot
in
the
wire
entering
the
hole
in
the
plug
before
i
connect
those
two
wires
to
the
screws
on
that
plug,
and
now
if
that
plug
is
pulled
by
the
wire
rather
than
by
the
plug,
that
knot
that
has
been
tied
in
the
wire
will
bear
against
the
hole
and
we
won't
be
pulling
the
contacts
out.
so
this
strain
relief
is
something
that
has
existed
from
many
years.
blonder,
who
is
one
of
the
co-inventors
here
testified
that
the
strain
relief
specifically
had
existed
from
many,
many
years.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
blonder
admitted
that
all
the
other
mechanical
elements
were
old
but
the
only
sum
total
of
all
the
other
mechanical
elements
in
this
claim
5
is
this
one
item.
blonder
also
testified
and
by
the
way,
petitioner's
brief
makes
much
of
the
fact
that
blonder
is
a
master
of
science
type
of
person.
blonder
is
of
course
the
moving
spirit
in
the
petitioner,
blonder
himself
testified
not
only
as
an
expert,
but
also
testified
that
the
ranger
3
antenna
put
out
by
blonder
was
made
in
accordance
with
claim
5
which
is
the
only
claim
at
issue
in
this
patent.
so
when
we
look
at
the
ranger
3
antenna,
which
by
coincidence
happens
to
be
not
exactly
coincidence,
i
must
confess,
happens
to
be
opposite
page
40
of
the
same
yellow
book.
the
ranger
3
antenna
does
not
provide
a
strain
relief
or
a
means
of
anchoring
that
lead
in
on
the
antenna.
so
on
page
2
of
the
brochure
that
goes
along
with
the
ranger
3,
on
second
page,
bottom
of
the
first
column,
there
is
an
instruction
to
the
installer,
lab
electricians
tapper
around
standoff
as
indicated
by
the
dotted
lines
in
b.
so
the
strain
relief
isn't
on
the
antenna
when
it
is
sold.
the
standoff
shown
up
there
at
the
upper-right
on
page
2b
is
a
means
of
supporting
or
spacing
the
lead-in
from
the
vertical
mass,
and
the
vertical
mass
is
not
the
antenna.
the
antenna
sits
on
the
vertical
mass,
and
this
ranger
3,
which
according
to
mr.
blonder
was
made
in
accordance
with
claim
5
of
his
patent,
that
is
so
without
this
strain
relief,
but
sold
within
an
instruction,
put
some
tape
around
this
bottom.
so
when
judge
hoffman
said,
in
the
second
sentence
of
that
paragraph
i
read
to
you,
when
judge
hoffman
said
that
it
is
thwart,
that
was
the
end
of
it.
he
is
either
right
or
wrong,
and
having
said
it
is
thwart
by
technical
board-52,
if
it
is
thwart,
perhaps
he
might
have
said,
yes,
just
while
looked
at
a
picture
of
myself,
said,
yes,
it's
got
a
nose,
yeah,
it's
got
two
eyes,
yes,
it
has
hair,
not
too
much
hair.
but,
when
he
says
it's
thwart,
he
is
making
a
statement
and
when
you
take
--
when
in
a
later
case
or
another
judge
should
want
to
see
what
the
basis
for
the
decision
was
and
simply
gets
a
xerox
copy
of
that
reference.
and
when
the
court
of
appeals
said
it
is
thwart
except
for
some
mechanical
elements
which
blonder
admitted
to
be
old,
those
mechanical
elements
added
up
to
all
of
that
single
unit,
the
strain
relief.
now,
i
have
a
few
seconds
left.
in
considering
question
number
2,
the
charges
of
fraud,
what
nasty
people
jfd
was,
how
jfd
either
let
the
illinois,
university
of
illinois
down
the
garden
path,
the
vis-a-vis,
i
don't
know,
just
keep
in
mind
that
when
you
read
these
charges,
every
single
one
of
them
is
an
allegation
and
every
single
one
of
them
without
a
single
exception
is
not
supported
by
proof.
in
the
time
left
to
me,
let
me
just
take
up
a
few
of
them.
number
1,
jfd
raided
the
blonder-tongue
employees.
in
the
period
that
jfd
was
supposed
to
have
raided
the
blonder-tongue
employees,
stolen
them
all
away,
100
employees
left
blonder-tongue,
5
of
those
who
had
left
came
to
jfd.
when
mr.
blonder
was
asked
to
list
all
of
the
antenna
manufacturers,
i
think
he
was
able
to
list
six
or
seven,
maybe
there
are
10
or
12
or
15
throughout
the
country,
and
why
did
as
many
as
fired,
120
of
those
who
left
come
to
jfd.
well,
blonder-tongue
is
located
in
new
york,
jfd
is
located
in
brooklyn,
and
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
not
too
many
people
want
to
live
in
new
york,
i
am
sorry,
mr.
justice
brennan,
[laughter]
and
not
too
many
people
want
to
live
in
brooklyn,
and
when
somebody
is
living
in
westchester,
on
long
island,
he
can
commute
almost
as
inconveniently
to
either
place.
in
other
words,
there
was
proximity,
and
we've
got
--
and
jfd
got
120
of
those
who
left.
mr.
ballash
(ph),
blonder
says
was
given
the
job
of
keeping
tabs
on
jfd.
not
only
keeping
tabs
on
jfd,
he
was
supposed
to
be
really
fully
in
charge
according
to
the
allegations
of
the
whole
antenna
division
of
blonder.
the
general
manager
of
blonder-tongue
testified
that
mr.
ballash
was
a
very
angry
man
who
left
--
who
complained
for
many
years
was
reduced
gradually
in
rank
and
finally
left
two
years
--
a-year-and-a-half
before
the
trial.
thank
you.
