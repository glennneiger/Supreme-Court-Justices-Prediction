mr.
rines,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief

warren
e.
burger
you
said,
thought
that
on
the
same
record
was
the
district
court
in
the
first
case
and
eighth
circuit
dealing
with
the
same
record
as
the
record
the
second
trial
for
judge
hoffman?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
documents
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
it’s
not
the
same
record
in
the
broad
sense
of
that
word?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
mclaren.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
thought
your
friend's
request
was
somewhat
narrower
than
that.
he
just
said
he
wanted
a
trial.
one
opportunity
to
try
a
case
the
way
he
thought
that
it
should
have
been
tried,
that
is
with
his
witnesses
available.
i
didn’t
understand
him
to
suggest
that
the
district
court
in
illinois
should
have
to
give
any
particular
weight
to
what
the
district
court
in
iowa
had
done?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
to
clear
that
up
in
his
rebuttal.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
marshall.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
say
concurrent,
you
mean
the
district
judges
in
each
of
the
two
circuits
or
the
--?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
it
indexed,
so
that
if
someone
who
came
to
look
through
an
index,
they
would
try
a
lead
to
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that
would
make
a
difference?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
don't
quite
see
that
mr.
marshall
how
the
intention,
if
that's
the
focus,
the
intention
is
affected
by
how
the
librarian
handles
it
at
first
instance.
here
you
concede,
ms.
johnson
intended
to
index
it
at
some
point
and
had
not
gone
around
to
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
should
that
relate
back
to
the
intent
of
the
person
who
sent
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
marshall,
i
am
reading
the
testimony
of
mr.
waller
and
after
acknowledging
that
ms.
johnson
had
indeed
described
this
as
a
local
library,
he
was
then
--
he
qualified
and
said
he
will
agree
that
it
isn't
a
library,
it's
a
depository.
he
was
asked
how
they
named
it,
what
they
called
it,
and
he
said
it
was
the
local
reading
room.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
a
little
later
on,
he
was
asked
was
the
information
concerning
the
documents,
and
reports
filed
available?
and
he
said
yes,
in
what
manner?
a
card
file
which
was
maintained
in
publications
office,
which
he
later
then
said
this
thing
should
be
cataloged.
now
that's
certainly
a
classic
example
of
the
fundamental
function
of
libraries,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
