how
about
in
the
eighth
circuit,
had
you
had
oral
testimony?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
alright.
oh!
yes,
the
have
defendant
there
did,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don’t
--
let's
assume
that
the
result
of
an
experiment
is
not
obvious
when
it
isn’t
predictable,
but
the
experiment
itself
is
obvious.
i
mean,
if
you
want
to
know
what
the
result
is
going
to
be
at
least
there's
plenty
of
indications
of
what
kind
of
experiments
you
want
to
run.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
i
don’t
suppose
unpredictability
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
a
pretty
good
law
then
in
other
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
isbell
is
endowed
for
the
lack
of
invention,
i
suppose
blonder-tongue
is
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
think
if
isbell
is
valid,
yours
ought
to
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean
you're
conceding
that
isbell’s
patent
is
valid,
yours
infringe
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
unobvious
from
isbell
maybe
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
you
construe
obviousness
or
nonobviousness
the
way
you
want
us
to,
it
sounds
to
me
like
your
patent
isn’t
a
very
strong
as
you
say.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
mclaren,
i
thought
i
understood
mr.
rines
to
say
that
he
thought
perhaps
he
wasn’t
asking
that
triplett
be
overruled,
but
there
might
be
room
for
modifying
in
this
case,
in
the
specific
circumstances
of
this
case
to
preclude
re-litigating
what
the
eighth
circuit
did
in
that
particular
circumstance,
that’s
what
i
understood,
maybe
i'm
wrong?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
petitioner
decided
finally
to
forgo
any
request
for
reconsidering
triplett
entirely
or
in
any
part.
i
had
understood
you
previously
say
you
would
welcome
a
modification
of
it
to
some
extent?
