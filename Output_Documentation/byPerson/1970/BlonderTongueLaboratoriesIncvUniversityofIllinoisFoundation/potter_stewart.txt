justice
potter
stewart
now,
this
device
down
at
the
table
to
your

is
that
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
the
subject
of
your
counterclaim?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
your
counterclaim?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i'm
asking,
what
was
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice

your
counterclaim
for
patent
infringement?
justice
potter
stewart
there
was.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
the
court
of
appeals
here
for
the
seventh
circuit,
i'm
looking
at
page
85
of
the
appendix,
i
don’t
know
what
page
it
is
in
the
f
2nd,
but
in
any
event
they
recognize
that
the
--
by
quoting
the
sentence
from
the
triplett
opinion,
they
recognize
that
the
iowa
decision
should
be,
at
least
eighth
circuit's
decision
should
be
as
a
matter
of
accommodation
should
be
respected
and
given
as
i
say
great
weight.
it’s
--
i
don’t
quite
understand
what
more
you
would
want
them
to
do.
they
did
pay
--
they
respected
it,
they
read
it,
they
understood
it
and
they
concluded
that
they
disagreed
with
it.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
of
course
now
you
read
into
this.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
i
saw
that
quotation
in
your
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
this
could
even
talk
about
the
cable
antenna
which
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
in
the
prior
art
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
the
cable
was
disclosed
in
the
application?
justice
potter
stewart
all
of
these
antennas
are
antennas
you
put
on
the
rooftop
rather
than
on
your
set?
justice
potter
stewart
that
doesn't
make
a
real
difference
whether
it's
from
top
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
sixth
circuit
opinion
you
are
relying
on
primarily,
the
language
of
that?
justice
potter
stewart
thompkins
or
whatever
it
is?
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
this
had
been
in
library
though?
you
would
say
it
would
still
hold
true
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
if
this
were
a
library,
there
would
have
been
publication?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
on
may
5th
1959?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
is
not
cleared
all,
that
this
document
was
even
in
that
so
called
library
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
need
not
to
be
the
general
public.
justice
potter
stewart
it
could
be
the
scientific
community
or
a
restricted
segment
of
the
public.
it
need
not
to
be
the
general
public?
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
in
april,
the
reports
had
been
mailed
out
to
those
so
called
correspondents?
justice
potter
stewart
what?
justice
potter
stewart
you'd
have
a
problem?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what
if
–
what
if
the
correspondents
came
in
on
the
day
before
they
were
mailed
and
asked
for
one?
justice
potter
stewart
but,
it
was
available
to
the
addressees?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
available
to
those
that
was
going
to
be
mailed
to,
the
university
at
every
intention
of
mailing
it
–
that
report,
as
soon
as
it
was
printed
to
the
addressees.
justice

stewart
quarterly
would
be
available?
justice
potter
stewart
university
might
change
his
mind
before
they
mailed
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yeah,
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
long
before
the
printed
reports
were
available
on
miss
johnson's
desk,
the
university
had
every
intention
of
mailing
the
reports
out
to
those
addressees?
justice
potter
stewart
you
of
course
didn't
interpose
that
as
a
defense
understandably?
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
