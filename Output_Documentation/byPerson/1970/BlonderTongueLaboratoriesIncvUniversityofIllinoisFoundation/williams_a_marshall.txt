mr.
williams
a.
marshall
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
listen
to
petitioners
standing
before
this
court,
it
sounded
like
he
was
asking
for
a
trial
de
novo,
that
isn't
the
issues
that
we
have
before
this
court.
there
at
the
--
there
was
two
trials
on
this
one
particular
patent,
the
isbell
patent.
there
were
concurring
findings
made
below
by
not
only
the
eighth
circuit,
but
also
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
we
feel
that
this
court
should
go
from
that
particular
point
rather
than
start
over
and
review
all
of
the
facts
in
these
matters.
for
example
in
the
concept
of
due
process,
this
wasn’t
even
raised
as
an
issue
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
this
is
an
argument
that
petitioners
have
brought
up
here
but
has
not
been
raised
as
a
point.
therefore,
i'm
not
going
to
pursue
that
because
the
concurrent
findings
below
in
the
seventh
circuit
clearly
held
that
there
was
no
fraud
so
far
as
the
endeavors
of
the
university
of
illinois
foundation
regarding
the
prosecution
of
the
mayes
patent.
i
might
point
out
so
that
this
court
can
properly
view
this
matter
in
its
proper
perspective.
the
university
of
illinois
foundation
is
an
arm
of
the
university
of
illinois
and
as
such
does
not
manufacture
nor
sell
anything.
its
sole
function
in
particular
instance
is
the
function
as
a
licensing
agent
to
license
antenna
manufactures
under
the
isbell
patent
or
any
other
patents
they
might
happen
to
have
in
their
portfolio.
similarly,
this
question
of
the
fraudulent
affidavit,
that
affidavit
was
made
as
we
contend
that
there
was
nothing
fraudulent
about
at
all,
but
that
affidavit
was
made
in
the
prosecution
of
the
mayes
patent
which
is
not
even
an
issue
here
and
from
the
standpoint
of
the
courts
below,
they
found
that
there
was
no
fraud
there.
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
said
that
that
patent
was
invalid
on
the
basis
of
obviousness
that
it
was
the
result
or
the
fruit
of
a
fraudulent
affidavit.
now,
let
me
get
down
to
what
i
feel
is
the
basic
issue
so
far
as
why
we’re
up
here.
we
--
if
i
will
--
if
i’ll
get
a
chance
i’d
love
to
discuss
the
triplett
v.
lowell
because
i
have
a
lot
of
good
points
on
that
one,
but
my
principle
concern
right
here
is
the
question
of
obviousness
as
equated
to
this
concept
of
obvious
to
try
test.
you
have
to
remember
that
in
the
end-result
that
section
103
calls
for
the
test
to
be
unobviousness.
but
what
we
say
is
that
predictability
is
a
factor
which
goes
into
determining
the
question
of
obviousness
so
that
you
have
to
say
--
you
have
to
consider
the
obvious
to
try
test
versus
the
concept
of
predictability
as
it
relates
to
the
issue
of
obviousness.
nobody
is
so
naive
in
the
patent
profession
to
espouse
the
doctrine
that
unpredictability
ipso
facto
gives
you
an
ultimate
result
of
unobviousness.
you
have
to
consider
the
not
the
platitude,
but
the
end-result
that
we’re
looking
for.
predictability
can
be
of
kind
or
it
can
be
of
degree.
when
you
talk
about
predictability,
predictability
can
be
in
terms
of
routine
experimentation
or
something
that
is
predictable
to
the
routine
experimenter
versus
the
unpredictability
that
arises
from
a
situation
which
a
pioneer
inventor
is
faced
with.
let
me
illustrate
the
routine
type
of
approach.
that
was
brought
up
in
the
case
of
--
in
the
mandel
v.
wallace,
a
case
which
was
before
this
court
involving
the
incorporation
of
a
corrosion
inhibitor
in
a
deodorant.
the
court
--
supreme
court
justifiably
found
that
the
incorporation
of
this
corrosion
inhibitor
into
this
cosmetic
was
obvious
because
it
should
have
been
perfectly
apparent
to
any
routine
investigator
to
investigate
1,
2,
3,
or
4
corrosion
inhibitors,
try
them
in
this
particular
cosmetic
environment,
as
underarm
deodorant
environment
and
expect
that
they
would
work.
therefore
you
have
the
concept
of
routine
investigation,
routine
experimentation.
you
couldn’t
really
predict
absolutely
that
this
corrosion
inhibitor
would
work,
but
you
had
a
reasonable
expectation.
now,
you
go
to
the
other
end.
this
is
a
predictability
of
degree
which
in
my
opinion
and
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
we
agree
is
unpatentable.
this
is
a
routine
type
of
experimentation.
let's
go
and
see
what
we
had
in
the
case
of
isbell.
isbell
did
not
have
this
type
of
background
prior
art
at
all.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
mr.
justice
you
have
reduced
it
is
the
over
simplification.
you
can't
do
that,
that
is
a
generalized
statement
that
i
wouldn’t
even
answer
yes
or
no
because
again
i
would
have
to
depend
upon
experimentation.
if
by
virtue
of
separating
these
two
space
booms
there
was
some
teaching
in
the
prior
art
that
i
was
in
clarified
the
signal
is
not
patentable.
but
on
the
other
hand,
where
you
have
a
situation
like
we
have
in
the
instance
of
the
isbell
patent,
not
a
question
i
think
in
all
due
deference
to
petitioner,
he
misstated
this
concept
mr.
justice
black
because
if
the
invention
--
the
isbell
invention
does
not
merely
go
to
the
spacing
of
the
booms,
there
are
many
other
concepts
involved
in
that
which
you
can
see
from
a
review
of
the
claims.
i
don’t
want
to
go
in
the
claims
because
this
is
a
completely
complex
and
technical
approach
that
we
can
spend
three
hours
on.
but
basically,
what
you
have
in
the
instance
of
the
isbell
invention
is
to
complete
unpredictability.
this
was
not
only
found
by
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
found
by
judge
hoffman,
it
was
found
where
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals.
so
for
mr.
rines
or
the
petitioner
to
say
that
the
end-result
was
predictable
is
wrong
because
there
is
a
concurrent
finding
that
it
was
not
predictable.
what
we
have
is
the
instance
not
of
taking
a
bunch
of
components
because
we
have
to
recognize
that
just
because
the
claimed
invention
is
a
combination
of
all
elements,
this
doesn’t
per
se
in
make
it
invalid
in
accordance
with
the
u.s.
v.
adams
doctrine.
we
have
a
situation
here
where
one
did
not
know
what
was
going
to
happen.
there
was
no
big
sign
post,
no
guide
post,
which
says
log
periodic
antennas
can
be
made.
there
was
a
concept
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
found
that
judge
stevenson
was
clearly
erroneous
in
making
that
finding
and
found
that
there
was
no
technique,
no
principle
for
designing
log
periodic
antennas.
what
they
found
was
that
there
is
a
principle
of
log
periodicity,
but
this
in
and
of
itself
doesn’t
permit
you
to
design
a
log
periodic
antenna
only
to
design
a
log
periodic
structure.
the
structures
,if
you
will
look
at
the
jassik
(ph)
handbook
which
is
in
430
of
appendix
2,
you'll
see
you
don’t
have
to
look
at
it
now,
but
there
are
a
number
of
log
periodic
structures
that
were
shown
--
that
were
available,
that
worked
as
log
periodic
antennas.
jassik
(ph)
himself
says
that
log
periodicity
is
unpredictable.
now,
what
you
have
is
the
dipole
antennas,
which
were
old,
you
have
the
transmission
lines
for
connecting
the
dipole
antennas,
those
were
old.
you
have
the
spacing
of
the
dipoles,
you
have
the
length
of
the
dipoles,
on
the
basis
of
this
log
periodic
theory.
but,
nobody
in
the
prior
art
told
you
how
to
put
all
these
elements
together
with
the
predictability
that
they
would
work.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
yes
sir,
that
was
one
in
which,
instead
of
having
straight
dipoles,
the
dipoles
were
folded
dipoles.
the
both
of
the
courts
below
found
--
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
yes,
it
was.
and
that
was
found
not
to
be
anticipatory,
nor
--
and
it
was
also
found
that
this
invention
was
obvious
over
the
cable
antenna.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
no
sir,
it
wasn't
because
i
will
tell
you
the
difference
because
basically
what
you
have
in
the
case
of
a
cable
antenna,
was
a
folded
dipole,
and
you
get
into
the
concept
of
frequency,
and
the
frequency
independence,
and
it
was
known
that
dipole
antennas
because
those
were
--
the
folded
dipoles
were
one
of
the
first
type
of
antennas
that
were
used,
i
am
sure
that
you
have
all
seen
that.
they
were
known
to
be
broadband
antennas.
straight
dipoles
were
not,
they
did
not
have
this
bandwidth
that
you
would
get
inherently
from
a
folded
dipole.
therefore,
it
was
unobvious
to
go
from
what
was
a
broadband
dipole
to
a
straight
dipole
which
had
an
narrow
width,
narrow
bandwidth.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
they
can
work
in
the
house,
for
example
this
one
here
--you
could
put
on
your
set
and
it
would
work.
this
is
for
the
ultra
high
frequency
and
of
the
range
of
channels
12
through
83.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
no
sir,
not
at
all.
but,
what
you
have
is
this
once
you
assembled
these
elements,
you
have
the
inter-relationship
between
them.
you
don't
know
what's
going
to
happen.
for
example,
they're
all
picking
up
signals
all
the
time.
so
that
you
have
this
particular
dipole
receiving
a
given
channel
area
while
this
one
receiving
another
one
and
you
have
them
both
receiving
the
same
signal.
so
that
you
get
this
inter
dependent
reaction
that
mr.
harris
has
testified
to
in
his
testimony,
is
one
of
the
problems
that
you
have
in
predicting
how
this
type
of
antenna
is
going
to
work?
so
that
you
didn't
have
any
place
where
mr.
isbell
could
start.
this
is
the
type
of
case
where
even
the
supreme
courts
have
recognized
that,
there
is
this
unpredictability
aspect.
for
example,
in
the
great
atlantic
and
pacific
case,
340
us
at
page
152
where
the
courts
recognized
that
in
the
conduit
science
as
such
as
chemistry,
such
as
the
electronics,
you
do
have
a
given
problem
of
predictability
or
unpredictability
that
you
don't
have
in
the
purely
mechanical
arts.
if
the
concept
of
obvious
to
try
is
going
to
be
the
log
land
high,
i
don't
think
that
it
augurs
well
for
the
patent
system,
because
i
don't
know
of
any
invention,
that
is
not
a
combination
of
all
or
known
elements.
for
example,
even
the
edison
light
bulb
which
was
a
patent
which
was
adjudicated
in
52
fed
200.
i
am
sure
that
you
all
have
heard
the
story
about
mr.
edison
and
his
trials
and
tribulations
in
inventing
the
light
bulb.
under
the
theory
of
obvious
to
try
without
regard
to
bringing
in
the
concept
of
predictability
of
kind,
you
would
have
an
invalid
patent,
because
all
mr.
edison
did
was
try
something
like
1400
filaments
to
try
and
to
eventually
get
to
as
electric
light
bulb.
so
that
what
we
have
here
is
isbell
coming
up
with
an
invention,
something
that
was
absolutely
unpredictable
as
found
by
the
courts
below.
the
record
us
replete
that
in
the
case
of
log
periodic
antennas,
one
could
not
predict
that
what
the
end
result
was,
and
it
was
not
a
question
of
cutting
and
trying
because
there
are
thousands
and
thousands
of
permutations
and
combinations,
that
one
can
try
--
cut
and
try
with
to
eventually
come
up
with
an
isbell
type
of
antenna.
now,
if
i
might
go
to
the
triplett
situation,
so
fas
as
i
believe
that
--
the
library
concept
your
honor.
here
again,
i
believe
mr.
justice
harlan
was
the
one
who
asked
about
the
library,
here
we
had
concurrent
findings
below
that
this
was
not
a
library.
there
was
no
--
it
was
not
shown
on
the
part
of
anybody.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
in
the
eighth
circuit
your
honor.
that
question
was
--
it
was
raised
as
a
defense,
but
was
never
decided
by
either
judge
stevenson
or
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
that
was
actually
--
they
decided
the
invalidity
of
isbell
purely
on
the
question
of
103.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
that
is
in
the
test.
the
test
is
intention
to
publish,
the
test
is
intention
to
publish.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
yes
sir,
that's
right.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
yes
sir.
no,
that's
the
massengill
case
as
one
of
them.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
intention
to
publish
your
honor,
and
there
was
absolutely
no
intention
to
publish
here
because
basically
this
quarterly
report
number
2
which
is
at
issue
was
a
report
which
was
prepared
as
a
result
of
the
antenna
program
which
was
being
conducted
by
the
university
of
illinois.
as
mr.
waller
testified,
it
was
the
policy
of
that
department
to
distribute
to
the
--
let's
say
the
correspondents
who
were
participating
in
the
program
copies
of
these
reports
before
they
were
made
available
to
the
public.
so
that
it
was
quite
clear
that,
so
far
as
the
university
of
illinois
found
--
the
university
of
illinois
because
they
were
the
ones
who
had
control
of
this,
so
far
as
they
were
concerned,
there
was
no
intention
to
publish
on
their
part,
at
least
until
it
was
--
these
copies
were
distributed
to
the
information
addressees.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
if
it
were
a
library.
i
mean,
if
it
were
a
full
blown
library,
and
a
document
were
put
in
that
library,
obviously
there
was
an
intention
to
have
this
published
to
anybody
who
came
in
the
library.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
well,
if
there
were
a
library,
and
if
it
were
proved
that,
that
document
was
in
the
library,
there
wasn't
even
any
proof
that
it
was
in
the
library,
because
these
--
it
was
a
question
of
three
or
four
days
timing
here.
these
quarterly
reports
were
printed
up
and
were
sent
from
the
printer
to
ms.
johnson
who
kept
them
in
a
bundle.
she
said,
if
someone
would
have
come
in
and
knew
that
specific
thing
was
there,
i
would
have
given
it
to
him.
well,
mr.
wallace
says
that,
that
was
not
the
policy.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
that
was
not
the
policy
of
the
university
of
illinois.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
well,
i
mean
i
wouldn't
draw
a
line
there.
i
would
say
that
if
i
send
a
publication
to
the
air
force
unless
there
was
some
confidentiality
aspects
of
that,
that
could
be
a
publication.
but
there
wasn't
any
proof
that
any
of
these
quarterly
reports
had
been
may
allowed.
they
were
merely
there
on
the
floor
of
ms.
jackson's
office.
they
weren't
even
in
this
“library.”
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
not
at
that
time,
no
sir.
eventually,
it
would
have
been.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
oh,
i
think
it
would.
yes
sir.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
well,
i
don't
know.
that's
pretty
close
mr.
justice
marshall.
there
might
be
an
intention
to
publish
but
it
wouldn't
be
accessible
to
anybody.
you
would
have
to
know
it
was
there.
so
that
if
a
bundle
of
pamphlets
came
into
the
chicago
public
library
and
were
put
on
the
floor
some
place
and
there
was
no
index
that
anyone
–
so
that
anyone
could
go
into
the
back
room
into
the
warehouse.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
no
sir.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
well,
because
in
this
particular
instance,
ms.
johnson
was
also,
she
wore
two
hats.
she
was
also
like
a
secretary,
office
manager
of
this
electrical
engineering
department
and
as
a
result
of
that,
she
ran
these
two
offices
plus
this
library,
the
thing
that
we
are
talking
about.
i
would
say
that
for
example
if
a
publication
––
thesis,
i
mean
these
are
the
classy
cases.
these
are
ones
where
a
thesis
is
deposited
in
a
library.
when
does
it
become
a
publication?
i
think
what
we
have
to
be
concerned
with
is,
when
does
it
become
legally
known.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
it
was
a
room
in
the
electrical
engineering
building
in
which
pamphlets
would
be
placed
from
time
to
time.
there
was
no
librarian
who
was
assigned
full
time
there.
in
fact
there
was
nobody
in
there
full
time
because
most
of
these
publications
were
kept
in
steel
and
files.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
actually
she
was
a
member
of
the
electrical
engineering
staff
and
i
believe
she
was
--
her
title
was
not
a
librarian.
she
was
like
a
secretary
or
an
office
manager
or
something
of
that
nature
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
to
mr.
waller,
mr.
waller
was
the
business
manager
of
the
university
of
illinois
electrical
engineering
department
and
she
was
on
his
staff,
not
as
a
librarian,
but
as
a
secretary,
this
type
of
thing.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
he
testified
justice
harlan
that
what
--
he
testified
as
to
the
policy
with
respect
to
the
university
of
illinois,
particularly
these
quarterly
reports
which
would
be
distributed
to
the
information
addressees,
and
it
was
his
testimony
that
when
a
report
was
prepared,
it
would
be
sent
down
to
ms.
johnson
from
the
printer,
for
distribution
to
the
information
addressees
and
that
his
testimony
was
that
it
would
not
be
made
available
to
the
public,
even
if
they
knew
who
was
there,
it
would
not
be
made
available
to
the
public,
until
they
were
mailed
out,
until
these
quarterly
reports
were
mailed
out
to
the
information
addressees.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
yes
sir.
which
was
--
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
that's
right.
the
only
testimony
--
the
only
documentary
evidence
of
that
nature
were
these
mailing
slips
and
things
of
that
nature
which
clearly
picked
on
this
may
15th.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
well
available
to
the
public.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
no
sir.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
no
sir.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
well,
what
she
said
was
that
if
someone
knew
that
it
were
there
and
came
in,
she
probably
would
have
given
it
to
them.
now,
this
is
inference
on
inference
or
innuendo
or
innuendo.
she
didn't
say
that
it
was
available
to
the
public
in
the
sense
that
a
publication
would
be.
she
didn't
--
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
then
we
would
have
a
problem.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
we
would
have
a
problem.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
yes
sir.[laughter]
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
under
those
circumstances,
if
the
information
addressee
knew
that
quarterly
report
number
two
was
there,
he
could
have
come
in
and
got
it,
and
that
may
have
been
a
publication,
i
don't
know.
i
mean
that's
a
hypothetical
because
that
isn't
what
happened
here.
we
didn't
have
anybody
coming
in
and
asking
for
a
copy.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
well
--
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
well,
they
have
the
intention
of
mailing
it
as
soon
as
it
was
mailed,
not
as
soon
as
it
was
available
because
someone
would
have
to
know
--
somebody
who
let's
say
who
is
an
information
addressee
would
have
to
know
that
quarterly
--
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
yes
sir,
because
how
else
would
they
know
where
to
go.
i
mean
--
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
then
if
they
put
out
let's
say
an
advance
list
saying
that
on
may
1st
we're
going
to
have
quarterly
reports
1
through
7
available
--
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
that's
right,
but
they
weren't
mailed
until
may
5th,
which
was
after
the
critical
date.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
yeah.
that's
right.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
i
agree.
i
agree
that
from
the
standpoint
of
a
principle/principal,
we're
not
–
we're
talking
about
a
principle
here,
but
so
far
as
the
facts
are
concerned,
the
facts
are
that
there
was
not
a
publication.
if
as
you
say,
the
report
had
been
prepared
–
my
time
is
up
your
honor.
if
a
report
had
been
prepared,
put
into
the
library
and
simultaneously
therewith
or
beyond
the
critical
date,
a
card
made
up,
put
into
an
index,
you
would
have
a
publication.
you
didn't
have
that
situation
here.
these
were
not
available
to
the
public.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
i
am
sorry,
i
didn't
get
a
chance
to
discuss
triplett.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
no
sir.
i
am
not.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
relatively
few
your
honor.
it's
purely
a
matter
of
fact
and
you
have
the
district
court
below
and
the
court
of
appeals
below
finding
that
there
was
no
publication.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
they
didn't
decide
the
question
your
honor.
it
was
up
as
a
matter
of
a
defense,
but
they
as
i
mentioned
before,
they
went
off
on
103.
thank
you
very
much.
i
am
sorry,
i
didn't
get
to
discuss
triplett.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
listen
to
petitioners
standing
before
this
court,
it
sounded
like
he
was
asking
for
a
trial
de
novo,
that
isn't
the
issues
that
we
have
before
this
court.
there
at
the
--
there
was
two
trials
on
this
one
particular
patent,
the
isbell
patent.
there
were
concurring
findings
made
below
by
not
only
the
eighth
circuit,
but
also
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
we
feel
that
this
court
should
go
from
that
particular
point
rather
than
start
over
and
review
all
of
the
facts
in
these
matters.
for
example
in
the
concept
of
due
process,
this
wasn’t
even
raised
as
an
issue
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
this
is
an
argument
that
petitioners
have
brought
up
here
but
has
not
been
raised
as
a
point.
therefore,
i'm
not
going
to
pursue
that
because
the
concurrent
findings
below
in
the
seventh
circuit
clearly
held
that
there
was
no
fraud
so
far
as
the
endeavors
of
the
university
of
illinois
foundation
regarding
the
prosecution
of
the
mayes
patent.
i
might
point
out
so
that
this
court
can
properly
view
this
matter
in
its
proper
perspective.
the
university
of
illinois
foundation
is
an
arm
of
the
university
of
illinois
and
as
such
does
not
manufacture
nor
sell
anything.
its
sole
function
in
particular
instance
is
the
function
as
a
licensing
agent
to
license
antenna
manufactures
under
the
isbell
patent
or
any
other
patents
they
might
happen
to
have
in
their
portfolio.
similarly,
this
question
of
the
fraudulent
affidavit,
that
affidavit
was
made
as
we
contend
that
there
was
nothing
fraudulent
about
at
all,
but
that
affidavit
was
made
in
the
prosecution
of
the
mayes
patent
which
is
not
even
an
issue
here
and
from
the
standpoint
of
the
courts
below,
they
found
that
there
was
no
fraud
there.
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
said
that
that
patent
was
invalid
on
the
basis
of
obviousness
that
it
was
the
result
or
the
fruit
of
a
fraudulent
affidavit.
now,
let
me
get
down
to
what
i
feel
is
the
basic
issue
so
far
as
why
we’re
up
here.
we
--
if
i
will
--
if
i’ll
get
a
chance
i’d
love
to
discuss
the
triplett
v.
lowell
because
i
have
a
lot
of
good
points
on
that
one,
but
my
principle
concern
right
here
is
the
question
of
obviousness
as
equated
to
this
concept
of
obvious
to
try
test.
you
have
to
remember
that
in
the
end-result
that
section
103
calls
for
the
test
to
be
unobviousness.
but
what
we
say
is
that
predictability
is
a
factor
which
goes
into
determining
the
question
of
obviousness
so
that
you
have
to
say
--
you
have
to
consider
the
obvious
to
try
test
versus
the
concept
of
predictability
as
it
relates
to
the
issue
of
obviousness.
nobody
is
so
naive
in
the
patent
profession
to
espouse
the
doctrine
that
unpredictability
ipso
facto
gives
you
an
ultimate
result
of
unobviousness.
you
have
to
consider
the
not
the
platitude,
but
the
end-result
that
we’re
looking
for.
predictability
can
be
of
kind
or
it
can
be
of
degree.
when
you
talk
about
predictability,
predictability
can
be
in
terms
of
routine
experimentation
or
something
that
is
predictable
to
the
routine
experimenter
versus
the
unpredictability
that
arises
from
a
situation
which
a
pioneer
inventor
is
faced
with.
let
me
illustrate
the
routine
type
of
approach.
that
was
brought
up
in
the
case
of
--
in
the
mandel
v.
wallace,
a
case
which
was
before
this
court
involving
the
incorporation
of
a
corrosion
inhibitor
in
a
deodorant.
the
court
--
supreme
court
justifiably
found
that
the
incorporation
of
this
corrosion
inhibitor
into
this
cosmetic
was
obvious
because
it
should
have
been
perfectly
apparent
to
any
routine
investigator
to
investigate
1,
2,
3,
or
4
corrosion
inhibitors,
try
them
in
this
particular
cosmetic
environment,
as
underarm
deodorant
environment
and
expect
that
they
would
work.
therefore
you
have
the
concept
of
routine
investigation,
routine
experimentation.
you
couldn’t
really
predict
absolutely
that
this
corrosion
inhibitor
would
work,
but
you
had
a
reasonable
expectation.
now,
you
go
to
the
other
end.
this
is
a
predictability
of
degree
which
in
my
opinion
and
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
we
agree
is
unpatentable.
this
is
a
routine
type
of
experimentation.
let's
go
and
see
what
we
had
in
the
case
of
isbell.
isbell
did
not
have
this
type
of
background
prior
art
at
all.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
mr.
justice
you
have
reduced
it
is
the
over
simplification.
you
can't
do
that,
that
is
a
generalized
statement
that
i
wouldn’t
even
answer
yes
or
no
because
again
i
would
have
to
depend
upon
experimentation.
if
by
virtue
of
separating
these
two
space
booms
there
was
some
teaching
in
the
prior
art
that
i
was
in
clarified
the
signal
is
not
patentable.
but
on
the
other
hand,
where
you
have
a
situation
like
we
have
in
the
instance
of
the
isbell
patent,
not
a
question
i
think
in
all
due
deference
to
petitioner,
he
misstated
this
concept
mr.
justice
black
because
if
the
invention
--
the
isbell
invention
does
not
merely
go
to
the
spacing
of
the
booms,
there
are
many
other
concepts
involved
in
that
which
you
can
see
from
a
review
of
the
claims.
i
don’t
want
to
go
in
the
claims
because
this
is
a
completely
complex
and
technical
approach
that
we
can
spend
three
hours
on.
but
basically,
what
you
have
in
the
instance
of
the
isbell
invention
is
to
complete
unpredictability.
this
was
not
only
found
by
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
found
by
judge
hoffman,
it
was
found
where
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals.
so
for
mr.
rines
or
the
petitioner
to
say
that
the
end-result
was
predictable
is
wrong
because
there
is
a
concurrent
finding
that
it
was
not
predictable.
what
we
have
is
the
instance
not
of
taking
a
bunch
of
components
because
we
have
to
recognize
that
just
because
the
claimed
invention
is
a
combination
of
all
elements,
this
doesn’t
per
se
in
make
it
invalid
in
accordance
with
the
u.s.
v.
adams
doctrine.
we
have
a
situation
here
where
one
did
not
know
what
was
going
to
happen.
there
was
no
big
sign
post,
no
guide
post,
which
says
log
periodic
antennas
can
be
made.
there
was
a
concept
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
found
that
judge
stevenson
was
clearly
erroneous
in
making
that
finding
and
found
that
there
was
no
technique,
no
principle
for
designing
log
periodic
antennas.
what
they
found
was
that
there
is
a
principle
of
log
periodicity,
but
this
in
and
of
itself
doesn’t
permit
you
to
design
a
log
periodic
antenna
only
to
design
a
log
periodic
structure.
the
structures
,if
you
will
look
at
the
jassik
(ph)
handbook
which
is
in
430
of
appendix
2,
you'll
see
you
don’t
have
to
look
at
it
now,
but
there
are
a
number
of
log
periodic
structures
that
were
shown
--
that
were
available,
that
worked
as
log
periodic
antennas.
jassik
(ph)
himself
says
that
log
periodicity
is
unpredictable.
now,
what
you
have
is
the
dipole
antennas,
which
were
old,
you
have
the
transmission
lines
for
connecting
the
dipole
antennas,
those
were
old.
you
have
the
spacing
of
the
dipoles,
you
have
the
length
of
the
dipoles,
on
the
basis
of
this
log
periodic
theory.
but,
nobody
in
the
prior
art
told
you
how
to
put
all
these
elements
together
with
the
predictability
that
they
would
work.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
yes
sir,
that
was
one
in
which,
instead
of
having
straight
dipoles,
the
dipoles
were
folded
dipoles.
the
both
of
the
courts
below
found
--
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
yes,
it
was.
and
that
was
found
not
to
be
anticipatory,
nor
--
and
it
was
also
found
that
this
invention
was
obvious
over
the
cable
antenna.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
no
sir,
it
wasn't
because
i
will
tell
you
the
difference
because
basically
what
you
have
in
the
case
of
a
cable
antenna,
was
a
folded
dipole,
and
you
get
into
the
concept
of
frequency,
and
the
frequency
independence,
and
it
was
known
that
dipole
antennas
because
those
were
--
the
folded
dipoles
were
one
of
the
first
type
of
antennas
that
were
used,
i
am
sure
that
you
have
all
seen
that.
they
were
known
to
be
broadband
antennas.
straight
dipoles
were
not,
they
did
not
have
this
bandwidth
that
you
would
get
inherently
from
a
folded
dipole.
therefore,
it
was
unobvious
to
go
from
what
was
a
broadband
dipole
to
a
straight
dipole
which
had
an
narrow
width,
narrow
bandwidth.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
they
can
work
in
the
house,
for
example
this
one
here
--you
could
put
on
your
set
and
it
would
work.
this
is
for
the
ultra
high
frequency
and
of
the
range
of
channels
12
through
83.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
no
sir,
not
at
all.
but,
what
you
have
is
this
once
you
assembled
these
elements,
you
have
the
inter-relationship
between
them.
you
don't
know
what's
going
to
happen.
for
example,
they're
all
picking
up
signals
all
the
time.
so
that
you
have
this
particular
dipole
receiving
a
given
channel
area
while
this
one
receiving
another
one
and
you
have
them
both
receiving
the
same
signal.
so
that
you
get
this
inter
dependent
reaction
that
mr.
harris
has
testified
to
in
his
testimony,
is
one
of
the
problems
that
you
have
in
predicting
how
this
type
of
antenna
is
going
to
work?
so
that
you
didn't
have
any
place
where
mr.
isbell
could
start.
this
is
the
type
of
case
where
even
the
supreme
courts
have
recognized
that,
there
is
this
unpredictability
aspect.
for
example,
in
the
great
atlantic
and
pacific
case,
340
us
at
page
152
where
the
courts
recognized
that
in
the
conduit
science
as
such
as
chemistry,
such
as
the
electronics,
you
do
have
a
given
problem
of
predictability
or
unpredictability
that
you
don't
have
in
the
purely
mechanical
arts.
if
the
concept
of
obvious
to
try
is
going
to
be
the
log
land
high,
i
don't
think
that
it
augurs
well
for
the
patent
system,
because
i
don't
know
of
any
invention,
that
is
not
a
combination
of
all
or
known
elements.
for
example,
even
the
edison
light
bulb
which
was
a
patent
which
was
adjudicated
in
52
fed
200.
i
am
sure
that
you
all
have
heard
the
story
about
mr.
edison
and
his
trials
and
tribulations
in
inventing
the
light
bulb.
under
the
theory
of
obvious
to
try
without
regard
to
bringing
in
the
concept
of
predictability
of
kind,
you
would
have
an
invalid
patent,
because
all
mr.
edison
did
was
try
something
like
1400
filaments
to
try
and
to
eventually
get
to
as
electric
light
bulb.
so
that
what
we
have
here
is
isbell
coming
up
with
an
invention,
something
that
was
absolutely
unpredictable
as
found
by
the
courts
below.
the
record
us
replete
that
in
the
case
of
log
periodic
antennas,
one
could
not
predict
that
what
the
end
result
was,
and
it
was
not
a
question
of
cutting
and
trying
because
there
are
thousands
and
thousands
of
permutations
and
combinations,
that
one
can
try
--
cut
and
try
with
to
eventually
come
up
with
an
isbell
type
of
antenna.
now,
if
i
might
go
to
the
triplett
situation,
so
fas
as
i
believe
that
--
the
library
concept
your
honor.
here
again,
i
believe
mr.
justice
harlan
was
the
one
who
asked
about
the
library,
here
we
had
concurrent
findings
below
that
this
was
not
a
library.
there
was
no
--
it
was
not
shown
on
the
part
of
anybody.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
in
the
eighth
circuit
your
honor.
that
question
was
--
it
was
raised
as
a
defense,
but
was
never
decided
by
either
judge
stevenson
or
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
that
was
actually
--
they
decided
the
invalidity
of
isbell
purely
on
the
question
of
103.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
that
is
in
the
test.
the
test
is
intention
to
publish,
the
test
is
intention
to
publish.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
yes
sir,
that's
right.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
yes
sir.
no,
that's
the
massengill
case
as
one
of
them.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
intention
to
publish
your
honor,
and
there
was
absolutely
no
intention
to
publish
here
because
basically
this
quarterly
report
number
2
which
is
at
issue
was
a
report
which
was
prepared
as
a
result
of
the
antenna
program
which
was
being
conducted
by
the
university
of
illinois.
as
mr.
waller
testified,
it
was
the
policy
of
that
department
to
distribute
to
the
--
let's
say
the
correspondents
who
were
participating
in
the
program
copies
of
these
reports
before
they
were
made
available
to
the
public.
so
that
it
was
quite
clear
that,
so
far
as
the
university
of
illinois
found
--
the
university
of
illinois
because
they
were
the
ones
who
had
control
of
this,
so
far
as
they
were
concerned,
there
was
no
intention
to
publish
on
their
part,
at
least
until
it
was
--
these
copies
were
distributed
to
the
information
addressees.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
if
it
were
a
library.
i
mean,
if
it
were
a
full
blown
library,
and
a
document
were
put
in
that
library,
obviously
there
was
an
intention
to
have
this
published
to
anybody
who
came
in
the
library.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
well,
if
there
were
a
library,
and
if
it
were
proved
that,
that
document
was
in
the
library,
there
wasn't
even
any
proof
that
it
was
in
the
library,
because
these
--
it
was
a
question
of
three
or
four
days
timing
here.
these
quarterly
reports
were
printed
up
and
were
sent
from
the
printer
to
ms.
johnson
who
kept
them
in
a
bundle.
she
said,
if
someone
would
have
come
in
and
knew
that
specific
thing
was
there,
i
would
have
given
it
to
him.
well,
mr.
wallace
says
that,
that
was
not
the
policy.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
that
was
not
the
policy
of
the
university
of
illinois.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
well,
i
mean
i
wouldn't
draw
a
line
there.
i
would
say
that
if
i
send
a
publication
to
the
air
force
unless
there
was
some
confidentiality
aspects
of
that,
that
could
be
a
publication.
but
there
wasn't
any
proof
that
any
of
these
quarterly
reports
had
been
may
allowed.
they
were
merely
there
on
the
floor
of
ms.
jackson's
office.
they
weren't
even
in
this
“library.”
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
not
at
that
time,
no
sir.
eventually,
it
would
have
been.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
oh,
i
think
it
would.
yes
sir.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
well,
i
don't
know.
that's
pretty
close
mr.
justice
marshall.
there
might
be
an
intention
to
publish
but
it
wouldn't
be
accessible
to
anybody.
you
would
have
to
know
it
was
there.
so
that
if
a
bundle
of
pamphlets
came
into
the
chicago
public
library
and
were
put
on
the
floor
some
place
and
there
was
no
index
that
anyone
–
so
that
anyone
could
go
into
the
back
room
into
the
warehouse.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
no
sir.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
well,
because
in
this
particular
instance,
ms.
johnson
was
also,
she
wore
two
hats.
she
was
also
like
a
secretary,
office
manager
of
this
electrical
engineering
department
and
as
a
result
of
that,
she
ran
these
two
offices
plus
this
library,
the
thing
that
we
are
talking
about.
i
would
say
that
for
example
if
a
publication
––
thesis,
i
mean
these
are
the
classy
cases.
these
are
ones
where
a
thesis
is
deposited
in
a
library.
when
does
it
become
a
publication?
i
think
what
we
have
to
be
concerned
with
is,
when
does
it
become
legally
known.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
it
was
a
room
in
the
electrical
engineering
building
in
which
pamphlets
would
be
placed
from
time
to
time.
there
was
no
librarian
who
was
assigned
full
time
there.
in
fact
there
was
nobody
in
there
full
time
because
most
of
these
publications
were
kept
in
steel
and
files.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
actually
she
was
a
member
of
the
electrical
engineering
staff
and
i
believe
she
was
--
her
title
was
not
a
librarian.
she
was
like
a
secretary
or
an
office
manager
or
something
of
that
nature
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
to
mr.
waller,
mr.
waller
was
the
business
manager
of
the
university
of
illinois
electrical
engineering
department
and
she
was
on
his
staff,
not
as
a
librarian,
but
as
a
secretary,
this
type
of
thing.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
he
testified
justice
harlan
that
what
--
he
testified
as
to
the
policy
with
respect
to
the
university
of
illinois,
particularly
these
quarterly
reports
which
would
be
distributed
to
the
information
addressees,
and
it
was
his
testimony
that
when
a
report
was
prepared,
it
would
be
sent
down
to
ms.
johnson
from
the
printer,
for
distribution
to
the
information
addressees
and
that
his
testimony
was
that
it
would
not
be
made
available
to
the
public,
even
if
they
knew
who
was
there,
it
would
not
be
made
available
to
the
public,
until
they
were
mailed
out,
until
these
quarterly
reports
were
mailed
out
to
the
information
addressees.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
yes
sir.
which
was
--
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
that's
right.
the
only
testimony
--
the
only
documentary
evidence
of
that
nature
were
these
mailing
slips
and
things
of
that
nature
which
clearly
picked
on
this
may
15th.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
well
available
to
the
public.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
no
sir.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
no
sir.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
well,
what
she
said
was
that
if
someone
knew
that
it
were
there
and
came
in,
she
probably
would
have
given
it
to
them.
now,
this
is
inference
on
inference
or
innuendo
or
innuendo.
she
didn't
say
that
it
was
available
to
the
public
in
the
sense
that
a
publication
would
be.
she
didn't
--
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
then
we
would
have
a
problem.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
we
would
have
a
problem.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
yes
sir.[laughter]
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
under
those
circumstances,
if
the
information
addressee
knew
that
quarterly
report
number
two
was
there,
he
could
have
come
in
and
got
it,
and
that
may
have
been
a
publication,
i
don't
know.
i
mean
that's
a
hypothetical
because
that
isn't
what
happened
here.
we
didn't
have
anybody
coming
in
and
asking
for
a
copy.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
well
--
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
well,
they
have
the
intention
of
mailing
it
as
soon
as
it
was
mailed,
not
as
soon
as
it
was
available
because
someone
would
have
to
know
--
somebody
who
let's
say
who
is
an
information
addressee
would
have
to
know
that
quarterly
--
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
yes
sir,
because
how
else
would
they
know
where
to
go.
i
mean
--
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
then
if
they
put
out
let's
say
an
advance
list
saying
that
on
may
1st
we're
going
to
have
quarterly
reports
1
through
7
available
--
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
that's
right,
but
they
weren't
mailed
until
may
5th,
which
was
after
the
critical
date.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
yeah.
that's
right.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
i
agree.
i
agree
that
from
the
standpoint
of
a
principle/principal,
we're
not
–
we're
talking
about
a
principle
here,
but
so
far
as
the
facts
are
concerned,
the
facts
are
that
there
was
not
a
publication.
if
as
you
say,
the
report
had
been
prepared
–
my
time
is
up
your
honor.
if
a
report
had
been
prepared,
put
into
the
library
and
simultaneously
therewith
or
beyond
the
critical
date,
a
card
made
up,
put
into
an
index,
you
would
have
a
publication.
you
didn't
have
that
situation
here.
these
were
not
available
to
the
public.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
i
am
sorry,
i
didn't
get
a
chance
to
discuss
triplett.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
no
sir.
i
am
not.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
relatively
few
your
honor.
it's
purely
a
matter
of
fact
and
you
have
the
district
court
below
and
the
court
of
appeals
below
finding
that
there
was
no
publication.
mr.
williams
a.
marshall
they
didn't
decide
the
question
your
honor.
it
was
up
as
a
matter
of
a
defense,
but
they
as
i
mentioned
before,
they
went
off
on
103.
thank
you
very
much.
i
am
sorry,
i
didn't
get
to
discuss
triplett.
