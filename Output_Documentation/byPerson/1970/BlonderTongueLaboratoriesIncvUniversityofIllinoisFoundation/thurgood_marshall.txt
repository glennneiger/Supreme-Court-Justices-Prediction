mr.
marshall,
if
you
have
these
two
pencils
and
you
get
a
blurred
signal
and
so
everybody
realized
that
one
of
the
problems
is
they’re
together.
so
you
separate
them
until
you
don’t
get
a
blurred
signal,
could
that
be
an
invention?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
terms
of
the
publish
i
am
a
little
confusion
about
it.
suppose
you
put
it
in
the
largest
public
library
in
chicago
and
said
here
this
for
you.
the
fact
that
they
left
it
in
the
package
without
interfering
with
sure
intention
to
publish.
i
would
assume
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
wouldn't
be
as
defected
as
just
put
it
in
envelope
and
mail
it
to
them?
