mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
on
the
belief
that
the
court
please,
that
we
still
hear
law
suits
on
the
record.
i
would
like
to
take
just
a
moment
at
the
outset
if
i
might,
and
talk
about
clark
versus
thompson,
the
case
back
in
1962
that
preceded
all
of
this
discussion
because
i’m
not
certain
from
the
references
in
the
briefs
to
clark
versus
thompson
that
all
of
the
members
of
the
court
may
understand
precisely
what
happened
in
clark
versus
thompson.
wherein
1962,
the
district
court
in
jackson,
mississippi
declared
that
certain
individual
plaintiffs
were
entitled
to
the
unsegregated
use
of
all
public,
recreational
facilities
that
is
including
zoos,
parks,
auditoriums,
libraries,
golf
courses,
all
public
recreational
facilities.
now
that
was
a
declaratory
judgment
proceeding.
no
injunction
was
issued.
now
what
happened?
from
the
way
that
case
is
cited
in
the
briefs,
i’m
afraid
you
withdraw
the
conclusion
that
the
city
appealed.
the
city
accepted
clark.
the
plaintiff’s
appeal
seeking
the
sweeping
injunction
that
had
not
been
granted
by
the
district
court
and
no
injunction
was
granted
by
the
fifth
circuit.
then
the
plaintiffs
sought
certiorari
here
and
again
were
unsuccessful.
my
point
simply
being
at
the
outset
that
from
the
moment
the
clark
decision
was
made
by
district
judge
meyers,
the
city
of
jackson
accepted
it.
and
from
that
day
to
this,
every
public
facility
in
the
city
of
jackson,
mississippi
where
the
recreational
or
otherwise
which
is
open
is
fully
segregated,
and
i
think
that’s
--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
--
fully
integrated,
excuse
me
your
honor.
appreciate
that
sir.
and
while
we
are
getting
our
word
straight,
if
the
court
please,
and
i
am
a
little
nervous,
in
fact
i’m
scared.
i
would
like
to
mention
to
the
court
a
few
of
the
things
that
i
think
we
can
agree
on
between
counsel,
so
that
perhaps
when
some
of
my
nervousness
subsides,
i
can
get
down
to
the
key
things
that
we
do
not
agree
on.
and
we
can
agree
on
this,
the
decision
in
clark
versus
thompson
was
correct.
it
has
never
been
questioned
by
the
city
of
jackson.
and
we
can
agree
on
this,
and
i’m
sure
you’re
going
to
ask
me
so
i’ll
go
ahead
and
say
it
at
the
outset.
the
administrative
decision
by
the
city
of
jackson,
mississippi
to
close
the
swimming
pools
came
after
the
clarke
case.
it
came
after
the
declaratory
judgment
had
been
issued.
it
came
as
a
result
of
it,
and
i
would
not
stand
here
as
an
officer
of
this
court
a
brand
new
one
at
that
and
tell
you
otherwise.
it
came
after
the
clark
case
and
as
a
result
of
it.
but
if
the
court
please,
here’s
where
we
get
to
the
difference,
and
here’s
where
we
get
to
the
heart
of
this
lawsuit.
the
decision
to
close
the
swimming
pools
in
jackson,
mississippi
was
not
out
of
spite
or
hatred,
or
any
of
the
other
insidious
motives
asserted
in
the
briefs
filed
in
this
court
by
the
petitioners.
while
the
decision
to
close
the
swimming
pools
came
after
the
clark
case,
it
was
not
from
a
desire
to
crush
black
people
or
to
reinstate
badges
of
slavery
for
goodness
sakes
or
to
discriminate
against
black
people.
here’s
what
the
record
shows.
the
record
shows
if
the
court
please
that
the
clark
decision
brought
new
problems.
now
here’s
the
city
council
in
the
city
of
jackson,
mississippi
in
1963
right
or
wrong,
and
i
contend
in
all
difference,
it
makes
no
difference.
right
or
wrong,
the
city
council
of
the
city
of
jackson
honestly
felt
that
the
personal
safety
of
some
of
its
citizens
and
the
maintenance
of
law
and
order
could
be
in
danger
if
swimming
pools
were
integrated
in
that
city
at
that
time,
right
or
wrong.
right
or
wrong
--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
no
sir,
’63.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
63.
right
or
wrong,
the
city
of
jackson
felt
it
could
not
justify
that
economic
loss
which
would
result
from
the
operation
of
pools
on
an
integrated
basis.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
it
was
a
minor
admission,
but
they
did
charge
admission.
and
i
frankly
say
to
your
honor
that
they
lost
money
then,
operating
on
a
segregated
basis.
but
they
felt
that
when
they
--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
exactly
sir,
exactly.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
i’d
like
to
talk
about
that
and
i
was
going
to
get
to
it
because
you’ve
asked
some
questions
about
it,
and
i
want
there
to
be
no
misunderstanding.
now
here’s
what
we
had
in
jackson
in
1962.
we
had
one
lake
now
it’s
called
the
pool.
but
one
large
lake,
livingston
lake,
which
had
been
in
existence
for
many
years,
it
is
still
there.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
no
sir,
it
was
a
lake
in
which
people
–
it
had
been
used
for
swimming
for
a
long
time,
but
it
--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
no
sir.
and
it
would
be
--
this
is
out
of
the
record,
but
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
convert
it
now
into
a
swimming
facility
unless
you
just
start
it
over
because
it’s
been
there
sitting
in
its
present
condition
for
so
long,
but
anyway
one
lake.
then
there
was
one
pool
and
what
had
been
a
black
neighborhood
in
jackson.
and
incidentally,
that
is
the
one
pool
which
has
never
seized
to
operate
and
is
operating
today
for
the
benefit
of
the
black
community
and
here
is
why.
that
one
pool
was
sold
by
the
city
of
jackson
to
the
ymca,
and
i’m
not
talking
about
the
leased
one
now,
this
is
a
different
one.
this
is
what
was
formally
in
the
black
neighborhood.
it
was
sold
by
the
city
to
the
y.
the
ymca
opened
it
up
and
the
black
people
boycotted
it.
so,
it
wouldn’t
be
in
use.
then
the
ymca
sold
it
to
jackson
state
college.
jackson
state
now
owns
it
and
operates
it.
so
that’s
what
happened
to
the
pool
that
was
in
the
black
neighborhood.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
predominantly.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
yes
sir.
no,
no
i
don’t
believe
it
is.
i
believe
it’s
a
private
institution.
but
i’m
really
not
certain.
i’m
sure
these
gentlemen
--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
i
think
its
open
--.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
i
think
it’s
used
for
the
students
of
jackson
state
and
their
guests.
i’m
not
sure
what
the
rules
are,
but
it
is
used
there
by
that
institution.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
not
to
my
knowledge,
no
sir.
then,
your
honor
that
leaves
the
pool
that
went
back
to
the
y,
the
leased
pool.
that
leaves
two
swimming
pools
that
were
formally
in
white
neighborhoods
in
the
city
of
jackson,
one
in
battlefield
park
and
one
in
riverside
park.
those
are
the
two
swimming
pool
facilities
that
stand
there
today
closed.
and
while
i
meant
to
get
to
this
in
a
moment,
i
don’t
want
to
forget
it.
one
of
you
asked
a
question
a
moment
ago
about
the
power
of
the
courts,
even
if
it
could
find
the
power
here
to
do
what
the
petitioner’s
request,
the
power
of
the
courts
to
compel
the
erection
and
construction
of
facilities
where
none
existed
before.
and
if
the
court
please,
that’s
exactly
what
would
happen
if
the
city
of
jackson
were
told
to
open
these
two
remaining
pools.
and
why
they
remained
in
what
has
traditionally
been
and
remains
white
neighborhoods
in
the
city
of
jackson.
and
don’t
you
know,
we’d
all
be
back
here
in
a
few
months
time
with
a
suit
to
require
the
city
of
jackson
to
build
additional
facilities
in
other
neighborhoods
and
perhaps
to
build
them
in
every
neighborhood,
and
perhaps
to
be
certain
that
people
intermingled
in
them
and
on
and
on.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
i
don’t
think
so.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
i
said
that
or
what
i
meant
to
say
sir
was
that
when
that
pool
was
sold
to
the
y,
of
course
it
was
in
a
predominantly
black
neighborhood.
and
when
the
ymca
attempted
to
operate
the
pool
--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
well
excuse
me
sir,
the
leased
one
is
given
--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
it’s
my
understanding
that
it
is.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
it’s
my
understanding
that
the
ymca
does
not,
but
out
of
practice
and
custom,
that
particular
ymca
pool
is
all
white.
now
that’s
i
have
no
personal
knowledge
of
that
sir,
but
i
want
to
give
you
a
frank
answer
and
i
think
those
were
the
facts.
let
me
quickly,
if
the
court
please,
try
to
get
down
to
the
heart
of
the
case.
now
counsel
respectfully,
they
are
searching
to
make
this
a
constitutional
case.
and
they
throw
out
endless
arguments
in
the
hope
that
one
of
them
will
catch
fire
in
the
heart
of
this
court.
they
say
if
the
court
please
and
they
say
this
without
authority,
and
they
say
it
all
the
way
through
their
briefs
that
the
city
of
jackson,
mississippi
has
the
burden
of
proving
that
the
closing
of
the
pools
was
not
for
a
discriminatory
purpose.
you
see,
being
the
plaintiffs
below
and
having
made
no
such
proof,
they
get
in
the
appellate
courts
and
switch
and
say
“well
the
burden
was
on
the
city
to
prove
that
it
did
not
have
an
improper
motive
when
it
closed
the
pools.”
and
they
cite
time
and
again
and
referred
to
at
the
moment
they
reach
the
floor
this
morning,
a
statement
from
another
fifth
circuit
case
in
1963
i
believe,
to
the
effect
that
jackson,
mississippi
has
maintained
a
steel
hard,
inflexible,
undeviating
official
policy
of
segregation.
now
here’s
what
they’re
really
saying.
what
they’re
really
saying
is
that
whenever
jackson,
mississippi
is
involved
in
a
lawsuit,
no
matter
what
the
proof
is,
this
court
must
assume
that
there
was
a
discriminatory
purpose.
that’s
what
they’re
saying.
you
see,
the
argument
appeals
to
the
past.
the
argument
appeals
to
the
popular
criticism
of
the
south
in
years
going
by.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
argument
is
an
attempt
to
pin
the
badge
of
slavery
that
counsel
discusses
upon
jackson
and
cities
of
the
deep
south
to
ask
you
today
and
i
guess
forever,
to
judicially
assume
no
matter
what
the
proof
is
that
the
motive
of
jackson,
mississippi
was
to
discriminate.
now,
i
have
no
purpose
before
this
honorable
court
to
attempt
to
justify
any
of
the
constitutional
privileges
that
were
denied
blacks
in
the
past,
both
in
jackson,
mississippi
and
elsewhere
throughout
this
country.
but
i
say
to
the
court
that
jackson,
mississippi
accepted
the
clark
decision.
jackson’s
public
facilities
are
integrated
totally.
i
think
you’re
well
aware
that
jackson,
mississippi
has
the
most
integrated
school
system
in
the
united
states.
jackson
should
not
now
or
forever,
unlike
other
litigants,
have
to
prove
itself
not
guilty,
have
to
prove
that
it
was
not
acting
out
of
discrimination.
now,
while
arguing
that
we
are
trying
to
pin
a
badge
of
slavery
on
somebody,
counsel
is
really
saying
“keep
jackson,
mississippi
in
line.”
assume
it
to
be
wrong
even
though
we
have
made
no
proof
whatever
to
that
effect
in
this
case.
in
addition
to
trying
to
shift
the
burden
to
the
city,
the
petitioners
are
persistently
saying
that
the
closing
of
the
swimming
pool
reflects
upon
that
black
people.
now,
if
the
court
please,
there’s
no
testimony
to
this
affect.
but
counsel
stands
up
and
says
“well,
here’s
a
way
a
black
person
would
feel,
and
this
is
the
appeal
to
your
heart.”
then
let’s
look
at
the
facts
from
the
record.
the
city
officials,
right
or
wrong,
feared
friction
between
the
races.
swimming
pools,
presents
hazards;
drowning,
injury,
hazards
unknown
to
most
recreational
facilities
--.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
if
the
court
please,
in
--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
i
think
that
when
you
are
dealing
with
a
recreational
facility,
a
facility
which
the
state
or
the
city
is
not
required
to
furnish
that
frankly,
the
city
had
the
power
no
matter
what
it’s
motive
was.
but
in
this
instance,
the
record
reflects
genuinely
what
its
motive
was.
the
point
that
i’m
trying
to
make
your
honor
is
that
the
decision
was
no
more
a
reflection
upon
black
people,
than
it
was
a
reflection
upon
a
certain
class
of
white
people
in
jackson,
mississippi.
it
was
not
a
reflection
on
black
people;
it
was
unfortunately
a
reflection
on
the
few
rednecks,
so
to
speak,
and
among
the
white
population
of
the
city
of
jackson.
to
feel
friction
between
the
races
is
not
the
same
thing
as
discrimination.
and
i’d
like
to
give
you
one
quick
illustration
if
i
might?
since
the
so
called
freedom
writer
incident
in
jackson,
in
the
early
1960’s,
to
my
knowledge,
our
city
has
had
no
violence
other
than
the
unfortunate
jackson
state
incident
with
which
you
are
familiar.
recently,
following
the
jackson
state
incident,
lynch
street,
a
public
street
in
the
city
of
jackson
which
goes
through
the
heart
of
that
institution
was
closed
by
order
of
the
city
council.
it
was
closed.
it
was
closed
to
black
people
and
white
people
just
as
the
swimming
pools
were
closed.
now
if
the
court
please,
it
was
closed
because
of
fear
between
--
of
friction
between
the
races,
and
it
was
closed
incidentally
at
the
request
of
the
black
community.
now,
i
mentioned
this
simply
to
point
out
that
no
one
finds
any
discrimination
from
the
perfectly
proper
and
legal
act
of
the
city
of
jackson
in
closing
a
public
street
which
formally
existed.
no
one
finds
that
this
is
an
attempt
to
degrade
anybody.
it
was
a
perfectly
proper
act
arising
out
of
fear
of
friction
between
the
races,
but
not
tantamount
to
discrimination
and
the
same
thing
is
true
here.
the
fifth
circuit
put
its
finger
on
the
answer
in
its
opinion
in
this
case
when
it
said
the
equal
protection
clause
does
not
promise
economic
equality.
if
a
badge
of
equality
has
been
taken
from
anyone
by
the
closing
of
few
swimming
pools
in
jackson,
mississippi,
it’s
been
taken
from
the
poor
people,
the
poor
white
people
and
the
poor
black
people.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
yes
sir.
it
certainly
does,
but
there
is
simply
no
way
for
a
city
or
a
state
for
that
matter
to
provide
recreational
opportunity
of
all
sorts
for
all
of
its
citizens,
white
or
black.
and
when
we
step
in
to
the
recreational
area,
if
the
court
please,
this
could
be
endless
because
i
could
have
my
feelings
hurt
if
a
certain
facility
is
not
provided.
it’s
provided
in
some
other
city
and
on
and
on.
i
think
what
the
fifth
circuit
was
trying
to
say
and
what
i’m
trying
to
say
is
that
this
decision
to
close
the
pools
back
in
1963
has
unfortunately
kept
a
few
black
people
and
a
few
white
people
from
swimming,
but
this
is
penalized
the
poor
people
and
not
the
more
affluent.
and
that’s
not
a
fourteenth
amendment
question,
nor
thirteenth
amendment
question,
and
i
think
it’s
interesting
that
the
united
states
chose
to
file
an
amicus
curiae
brief
in
this
court,
excellent
brief,
and
did
not
mention
the
thirteenth
amendment
question
which
had
been
argued
here
this
morning,
did
not
mention
it.
and
i
think
it
was
ignored
by
the
united
states
because
this
is
obviously
not
a
thirteenth
amendment
question.
finally,
if
the
court
please,
i
would
like
to
briefly
touch
on
what
could
happen
if
this
landmark
decision
went
the
way
petitioner’s
would
like
for
it
to
go,
and
that’s
what
it
would
be.
that’s
what
they’re
asking
you
to
do.
they’re
asking
you
take
up
sonnets
from
jones
and
a
phrase
from
the
thirteenth
amendment
and
a
sonnets
back
from
another
decision
here
and
branch
out
as
he
said
in
a
sweeping
judicial
file,
a
landmark
decision
into
nonessential,
nongovernmental,
purely
recreational
functions
of
a
municipality
in
this
country.
i
submit
in
all
difference
that
if
the
federal
courts
in
this
country
get
into
the
swimming
pool
business,
i
don’t
think
it
can
stop
with
jackson,
mississippi,
because
as
i
said
a
minute
ago,
these
folks
are
not
going
to
be
satisfied
with
an
order
to
reopen
to
probably
now
deteriorated
pools
in
predominantly
white
neighborhoods.
they’re
going
to
want
other
pools
built.
they’re
going
to
want
to
maintain.
they’re
going
to
want
tax
monies
levied
if
necessary.
they
going
to
want
them
supervised.
they
going
to
want
people
there.
they’re
going
to
say
that
“they’re
not
enough
in
the
black
neighborhoods”,
and
on
and
on.
and
finally,
if
by
freedom
of
choice,
people
go
to
pools
so
that
the
result
is
still
as
he
says
segregated
instead
of
integrated,
then
further
litigation
will
come
from
there.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
1963
sir.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
i
mentioned
at
the
beginning
the
history
of
clark
and
the
fact
that
jackson
accepted
it
immediately.
i
don’t
know
sir,
except
to
say
that
as
i
understand
it,
the
fifth
circuit,
i
believe
held
this
case
some
two
years
--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
he
mentioned
that
sir.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
they
held
it
two
years
to
dissent,
i
believe.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
i
think
what
happened
is
that
when
the
majority
opinion
was
rendered
in
the
fifth
circuit
that
the
other
judges
reserved
the
right
to
file
a
dissenting
opinion
and
this
act
alone
took
two
years,
so
that’s
part
of
the
briefs.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
i
was
going
to
touch
on
that
and
i’m
glad
you
asked
me.
it
maybe,
if
the
court
please
that
some
day,
the
city
of
jackson
will
choose
to
reopen
these
pools
or
build
others.
we
have
a
new
city
administration
in
jackson.
we
don’t
have
a
single
person
on
the
council
that
was
on
the
council
when
this
decision
was
made.
it
may
well
be
that
the
city
of
jackson
will
on
its
own
decide
to
change
this
policy.
on
the
other
hand
it
may
not.
this
is
something
which
i’m
not
prepared
to
say,
but
i
am
prepared
to
say
that
sets
clark,
the
city
of
jackson
is
fully
integrated.
it
has
fully
accepted
clark.
every
public
facility
is
in
full
compliance
with
the
laws
of
the
united
states
and
the
decisions
of
this
court.
and
i
have
no
reason
to
believe
but
that
the
city
officials
in
their
discretion
will
do
the
proper
thing
at
the
proper
time
with
regard
to
swimming
pools
as
well
as
any
other
recreational
facility
in
that
city.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
what
do
i
consider
to
be
the
proper
thing?
i
think
--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
i
think
that
what
that
simply
means
is
what
the
situation
in
jackson,
mississippi
is
at
a
particular
time,
both
insofar
as
friction
is
concerned,
insofar
as
money
is
concerned
and
insofar
as
it’s
overall
recreational
program
is
concerned.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
jackson
is
now
about
175,000
people.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
approximately
60%
white.
back
when
this
suit
was
filed,
i
think
the
record
showed
the
city
was
150,000,
100,000
white,
50,000
black.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
on
the
council?
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
well
we
only
have
a
mayor
and
two
commissioners
who
are
elected
officials.
we
have
--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
the
others
are
appointed.
we
certainly
have
colored
people
working
for
the
city.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
no
sir.
the
county
is
operated
by
a
five-man
board
of
supervisors.
and
that
board
at
the
moment
is
all
white.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
oh,
we’ve
had
blacks
on
the
police
force
for
many
years
in
jackson.
certainly
since
the
time
this
all
originated.
finally,
if
the
court
please,
what
i’d
like
to
leave
with
you
is
that
there
is
a
limit
to
which
this
court
can
reasonably
go
under
the
constitution.
we
can’t
make
constitutional
questions
where
no
constitutional
issue
exists.
this
lawsuit
has
been
handled
from
the
time
it
was
filed
up
until
the
present
time
by
my
senior
partner.
he
was
unable
to
appear
here
and
argue
it
because
of
a
conflict.
it’s
been
an
honor
for
me
to
appear
before
this
court,
and
i
hope
that
the
court
will
not
penalize
the
city
of
jackson
because
we
sent
the
second
team.
this
is
a
serious
case
to
the
city
of
jackson
for
it
honestly
felt
that
the
time
this
decision
was
made
and
honestly
feels
today
that
there
was
no
constitutional
question
presented.
and
in
conclusion,
let
met
remind
the
court
that
this
case
was
filed
on
a
fourteenth
amendment
theory.
the
thirteenth
amendment
argument
came
as
an
afterthought.
that
afterthought
has
been
ignored
by
the
united
states,
but
now
the
afterthought
seems
to
be
the
primary
thrust
of
the
petitioners
who
are
simply
grasping
for
some
way
to
find
the
constitutional
issue
where
none
exists.
we
submit
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
on
the
belief
that
the
court
please,
that
we
still
hear
law
suits
on
the
record.
i
would
like
to
take
just
a
moment
at
the
outset
if
i
might,
and
talk
about
clark
versus
thompson,
the
case
back
in
1962
that
preceded
all
of
this
discussion
because
i’m
not
certain
from
the
references
in
the
briefs
to
clark
versus
thompson
that
all
of
the
members
of
the
court
may
understand
precisely
what
happened
in
clark
versus
thompson.
wherein
1962,
the
district
court
in
jackson,
mississippi
declared
that
certain
individual
plaintiffs
were
entitled
to
the
unsegregated
use
of
all
public,
recreational
facilities
that
is
including
zoos,
parks,
auditoriums,
libraries,
golf
courses,
all
public
recreational
facilities.
now
that
was
a
declaratory
judgment
proceeding.
no
injunction
was
issued.
now
what
happened?
from
the
way
that
case
is
cited
in
the
briefs,
i’m
afraid
you
withdraw
the
conclusion
that
the
city
appealed.
the
city
accepted
clark.
the
plaintiff’s
appeal
seeking
the
sweeping
injunction
that
had
not
been
granted
by
the
district
court
and
no
injunction
was
granted
by
the
fifth
circuit.
then
the
plaintiffs
sought
certiorari
here
and
again
were
unsuccessful.
my
point
simply
being
at
the
outset
that
from
the
moment
the
clark
decision
was
made
by
district
judge
meyers,
the
city
of
jackson
accepted
it.
and
from
that
day
to
this,
every
public
facility
in
the
city
of
jackson,
mississippi
where
the
recreational
or
otherwise
which
is
open
is
fully
segregated,
and
i
think
that’s
--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
--
fully
integrated,
excuse
me
your
honor.
appreciate
that
sir.
and
while
we
are
getting
our
word
straight,
if
the
court
please,
and
i
am
a
little
nervous,
in
fact
i’m
scared.
i
would
like
to
mention
to
the
court
a
few
of
the
things
that
i
think
we
can
agree
on
between
counsel,
so
that
perhaps
when
some
of
my
nervousness
subsides,
i
can
get
down
to
the
key
things
that
we
do
not
agree
on.
and
we
can
agree
on
this,
the
decision
in
clark
versus
thompson
was
correct.
it
has
never
been
questioned
by
the
city
of
jackson.
and
we
can
agree
on
this,
and
i’m
sure
you’re
going
to
ask
me
so
i’ll
go
ahead
and
say
it
at
the
outset.
the
administrative
decision
by
the
city
of
jackson,
mississippi
to
close
the
swimming
pools
came
after
the
clarke
case.
it
came
after
the
declaratory
judgment
had
been
issued.
it
came
as
a
result
of
it,
and
i
would
not
stand
here
as
an
officer
of
this
court
a
brand
new
one
at
that
and
tell
you
otherwise.
it
came
after
the
clark
case
and
as
a
result
of
it.
but
if
the
court
please,
here’s
where
we
get
to
the
difference,
and
here’s
where
we
get
to
the
heart
of
this
lawsuit.
the
decision
to
close
the
swimming
pools
in
jackson,
mississippi
was
not
out
of
spite
or
hatred,
or
any
of
the
other
insidious
motives
asserted
in
the
briefs
filed
in
this
court
by
the
petitioners.
while
the
decision
to
close
the
swimming
pools
came
after
the
clark
case,
it
was
not
from
a
desire
to
crush
black
people
or
to
reinstate
badges
of
slavery
for
goodness
sakes
or
to
discriminate
against
black
people.
here’s
what
the
record
shows.
the
record
shows
if
the
court
please
that
the
clark
decision
brought
new
problems.
now
here’s
the
city
council
in
the
city
of
jackson,
mississippi
in
1963
right
or
wrong,
and
i
contend
in
all
difference,
it
makes
no
difference.
right
or
wrong,
the
city
council
of
the
city
of
jackson
honestly
felt
that
the
personal
safety
of
some
of
its
citizens
and
the
maintenance
of
law
and
order
could
be
in
danger
if
swimming
pools
were
integrated
in
that
city
at
that
time,
right
or
wrong.
right
or
wrong
--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
no
sir,
’63.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
63.
right
or
wrong,
the
city
of
jackson
felt
it
could
not
justify
that
economic
loss
which
would
result
from
the
operation
of
pools
on
an
integrated
basis.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
it
was
a
minor
admission,
but
they
did
charge
admission.
and
i
frankly
say
to
your
honor
that
they
lost
money
then,
operating
on
a
segregated
basis.
but
they
felt
that
when
they
--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
exactly
sir,
exactly.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
i’d
like
to
talk
about
that
and
i
was
going
to
get
to
it
because
you’ve
asked
some
questions
about
it,
and
i
want
there
to
be
no
misunderstanding.
now
here’s
what
we
had
in
jackson
in
1962.
we
had
one
lake
now
it’s
called
the
pool.
but
one
large
lake,
livingston
lake,
which
had
been
in
existence
for
many
years,
it
is
still
there.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
no
sir,
it
was
a
lake
in
which
people
–
it
had
been
used
for
swimming
for
a
long
time,
but
it
--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
no
sir.
and
it
would
be
--
this
is
out
of
the
record,
but
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
convert
it
now
into
a
swimming
facility
unless
you
just
start
it
over
because
it’s
been
there
sitting
in
its
present
condition
for
so
long,
but
anyway
one
lake.
then
there
was
one
pool
and
what
had
been
a
black
neighborhood
in
jackson.
and
incidentally,
that
is
the
one
pool
which
has
never
seized
to
operate
and
is
operating
today
for
the
benefit
of
the
black
community
and
here
is
why.
that
one
pool
was
sold
by
the
city
of
jackson
to
the
ymca,
and
i’m
not
talking
about
the
leased
one
now,
this
is
a
different
one.
this
is
what
was
formally
in
the
black
neighborhood.
it
was
sold
by
the
city
to
the
y.
the
ymca
opened
it
up
and
the
black
people
boycotted
it.
so,
it
wouldn’t
be
in
use.
then
the
ymca
sold
it
to
jackson
state
college.
jackson
state
now
owns
it
and
operates
it.
so
that’s
what
happened
to
the
pool
that
was
in
the
black
neighborhood.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
predominantly.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
yes
sir.
no,
no
i
don’t
believe
it
is.
i
believe
it’s
a
private
institution.
but
i’m
really
not
certain.
i’m
sure
these
gentlemen
--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
i
think
its
open
--.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
i
think
it’s
used
for
the
students
of
jackson
state
and
their
guests.
i’m
not
sure
what
the
rules
are,
but
it
is
used
there
by
that
institution.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
not
to
my
knowledge,
no
sir.
then,
your
honor
that
leaves
the
pool
that
went
back
to
the
y,
the
leased
pool.
that
leaves
two
swimming
pools
that
were
formally
in
white
neighborhoods
in
the
city
of
jackson,
one
in
battlefield
park
and
one
in
riverside
park.
those
are
the
two
swimming
pool
facilities
that
stand
there
today
closed.
and
while
i
meant
to
get
to
this
in
a
moment,
i
don’t
want
to
forget
it.
one
of
you
asked
a
question
a
moment
ago
about
the
power
of
the
courts,
even
if
it
could
find
the
power
here
to
do
what
the
petitioner’s
request,
the
power
of
the
courts
to
compel
the
erection
and
construction
of
facilities
where
none
existed
before.
and
if
the
court
please,
that’s
exactly
what
would
happen
if
the
city
of
jackson
were
told
to
open
these
two
remaining
pools.
and
why
they
remained
in
what
has
traditionally
been
and
remains
white
neighborhoods
in
the
city
of
jackson.
and
don’t
you
know,
we’d
all
be
back
here
in
a
few
months
time
with
a
suit
to
require
the
city
of
jackson
to
build
additional
facilities
in
other
neighborhoods
and
perhaps
to
build
them
in
every
neighborhood,
and
perhaps
to
be
certain
that
people
intermingled
in
them
and
on
and
on.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
i
don’t
think
so.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
i
said
that
or
what
i
meant
to
say
sir
was
that
when
that
pool
was
sold
to
the
y,
of
course
it
was
in
a
predominantly
black
neighborhood.
and
when
the
ymca
attempted
to
operate
the
pool
--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
well
excuse
me
sir,
the
leased
one
is
given
--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
it’s
my
understanding
that
it
is.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
it’s
my
understanding
that
the
ymca
does
not,
but
out
of
practice
and
custom,
that
particular
ymca
pool
is
all
white.
now
that’s
i
have
no
personal
knowledge
of
that
sir,
but
i
want
to
give
you
a
frank
answer
and
i
think
those
were
the
facts.
let
me
quickly,
if
the
court
please,
try
to
get
down
to
the
heart
of
the
case.
now
counsel
respectfully,
they
are
searching
to
make
this
a
constitutional
case.
and
they
throw
out
endless
arguments
in
the
hope
that
one
of
them
will
catch
fire
in
the
heart
of
this
court.
they
say
if
the
court
please
and
they
say
this
without
authority,
and
they
say
it
all
the
way
through
their
briefs
that
the
city
of
jackson,
mississippi
has
the
burden
of
proving
that
the
closing
of
the
pools
was
not
for
a
discriminatory
purpose.
you
see,
being
the
plaintiffs
below
and
having
made
no
such
proof,
they
get
in
the
appellate
courts
and
switch
and
say
“well
the
burden
was
on
the
city
to
prove
that
it
did
not
have
an
improper
motive
when
it
closed
the
pools.”
and
they
cite
time
and
again
and
referred
to
at
the
moment
they
reach
the
floor
this
morning,
a
statement
from
another
fifth
circuit
case
in
1963
i
believe,
to
the
effect
that
jackson,
mississippi
has
maintained
a
steel
hard,
inflexible,
undeviating
official
policy
of
segregation.
now
here’s
what
they’re
really
saying.
what
they’re
really
saying
is
that
whenever
jackson,
mississippi
is
involved
in
a
lawsuit,
no
matter
what
the
proof
is,
this
court
must
assume
that
there
was
a
discriminatory
purpose.
that’s
what
they’re
saying.
you
see,
the
argument
appeals
to
the
past.
the
argument
appeals
to
the
popular
criticism
of
the
south
in
years
going
by.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
argument
is
an
attempt
to
pin
the
badge
of
slavery
that
counsel
discusses
upon
jackson
and
cities
of
the
deep
south
to
ask
you
today
and
i
guess
forever,
to
judicially
assume
no
matter
what
the
proof
is
that
the
motive
of
jackson,
mississippi
was
to
discriminate.
now,
i
have
no
purpose
before
this
honorable
court
to
attempt
to
justify
any
of
the
constitutional
privileges
that
were
denied
blacks
in
the
past,
both
in
jackson,
mississippi
and
elsewhere
throughout
this
country.
but
i
say
to
the
court
that
jackson,
mississippi
accepted
the
clark
decision.
jackson’s
public
facilities
are
integrated
totally.
i
think
you’re
well
aware
that
jackson,
mississippi
has
the
most
integrated
school
system
in
the
united
states.
jackson
should
not
now
or
forever,
unlike
other
litigants,
have
to
prove
itself
not
guilty,
have
to
prove
that
it
was
not
acting
out
of
discrimination.
now,
while
arguing
that
we
are
trying
to
pin
a
badge
of
slavery
on
somebody,
counsel
is
really
saying
“keep
jackson,
mississippi
in
line.”
assume
it
to
be
wrong
even
though
we
have
made
no
proof
whatever
to
that
effect
in
this
case.
in
addition
to
trying
to
shift
the
burden
to
the
city,
the
petitioners
are
persistently
saying
that
the
closing
of
the
swimming
pool
reflects
upon
that
black
people.
now,
if
the
court
please,
there’s
no
testimony
to
this
affect.
but
counsel
stands
up
and
says
“well,
here’s
a
way
a
black
person
would
feel,
and
this
is
the
appeal
to
your
heart.”
then
let’s
look
at
the
facts
from
the
record.
the
city
officials,
right
or
wrong,
feared
friction
between
the
races.
swimming
pools,
presents
hazards;
drowning,
injury,
hazards
unknown
to
most
recreational
facilities
--.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
if
the
court
please,
in
--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
i
think
that
when
you
are
dealing
with
a
recreational
facility,
a
facility
which
the
state
or
the
city
is
not
required
to
furnish
that
frankly,
the
city
had
the
power
no
matter
what
it’s
motive
was.
but
in
this
instance,
the
record
reflects
genuinely
what
its
motive
was.
the
point
that
i’m
trying
to
make
your
honor
is
that
the
decision
was
no
more
a
reflection
upon
black
people,
than
it
was
a
reflection
upon
a
certain
class
of
white
people
in
jackson,
mississippi.
it
was
not
a
reflection
on
black
people;
it
was
unfortunately
a
reflection
on
the
few
rednecks,
so
to
speak,
and
among
the
white
population
of
the
city
of
jackson.
to
feel
friction
between
the
races
is
not
the
same
thing
as
discrimination.
and
i’d
like
to
give
you
one
quick
illustration
if
i
might?
since
the
so
called
freedom
writer
incident
in
jackson,
in
the
early
1960’s,
to
my
knowledge,
our
city
has
had
no
violence
other
than
the
unfortunate
jackson
state
incident
with
which
you
are
familiar.
recently,
following
the
jackson
state
incident,
lynch
street,
a
public
street
in
the
city
of
jackson
which
goes
through
the
heart
of
that
institution
was
closed
by
order
of
the
city
council.
it
was
closed.
it
was
closed
to
black
people
and
white
people
just
as
the
swimming
pools
were
closed.
now
if
the
court
please,
it
was
closed
because
of
fear
between
--
of
friction
between
the
races,
and
it
was
closed
incidentally
at
the
request
of
the
black
community.
now,
i
mentioned
this
simply
to
point
out
that
no
one
finds
any
discrimination
from
the
perfectly
proper
and
legal
act
of
the
city
of
jackson
in
closing
a
public
street
which
formally
existed.
no
one
finds
that
this
is
an
attempt
to
degrade
anybody.
it
was
a
perfectly
proper
act
arising
out
of
fear
of
friction
between
the
races,
but
not
tantamount
to
discrimination
and
the
same
thing
is
true
here.
the
fifth
circuit
put
its
finger
on
the
answer
in
its
opinion
in
this
case
when
it
said
the
equal
protection
clause
does
not
promise
economic
equality.
if
a
badge
of
equality
has
been
taken
from
anyone
by
the
closing
of
few
swimming
pools
in
jackson,
mississippi,
it’s
been
taken
from
the
poor
people,
the
poor
white
people
and
the
poor
black
people.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
yes
sir.
it
certainly
does,
but
there
is
simply
no
way
for
a
city
or
a
state
for
that
matter
to
provide
recreational
opportunity
of
all
sorts
for
all
of
its
citizens,
white
or
black.
and
when
we
step
in
to
the
recreational
area,
if
the
court
please,
this
could
be
endless
because
i
could
have
my
feelings
hurt
if
a
certain
facility
is
not
provided.
it’s
provided
in
some
other
city
and
on
and
on.
i
think
what
the
fifth
circuit
was
trying
to
say
and
what
i’m
trying
to
say
is
that
this
decision
to
close
the
pools
back
in
1963
has
unfortunately
kept
a
few
black
people
and
a
few
white
people
from
swimming,
but
this
is
penalized
the
poor
people
and
not
the
more
affluent.
and
that’s
not
a
fourteenth
amendment
question,
nor
thirteenth
amendment
question,
and
i
think
it’s
interesting
that
the
united
states
chose
to
file
an
amicus
curiae
brief
in
this
court,
excellent
brief,
and
did
not
mention
the
thirteenth
amendment
question
which
had
been
argued
here
this
morning,
did
not
mention
it.
and
i
think
it
was
ignored
by
the
united
states
because
this
is
obviously
not
a
thirteenth
amendment
question.
finally,
if
the
court
please,
i
would
like
to
briefly
touch
on
what
could
happen
if
this
landmark
decision
went
the
way
petitioner’s
would
like
for
it
to
go,
and
that’s
what
it
would
be.
that’s
what
they’re
asking
you
to
do.
they’re
asking
you
take
up
sonnets
from
jones
and
a
phrase
from
the
thirteenth
amendment
and
a
sonnets
back
from
another
decision
here
and
branch
out
as
he
said
in
a
sweeping
judicial
file,
a
landmark
decision
into
nonessential,
nongovernmental,
purely
recreational
functions
of
a
municipality
in
this
country.
i
submit
in
all
difference
that
if
the
federal
courts
in
this
country
get
into
the
swimming
pool
business,
i
don’t
think
it
can
stop
with
jackson,
mississippi,
because
as
i
said
a
minute
ago,
these
folks
are
not
going
to
be
satisfied
with
an
order
to
reopen
to
probably
now
deteriorated
pools
in
predominantly
white
neighborhoods.
they’re
going
to
want
other
pools
built.
they’re
going
to
want
to
maintain.
they’re
going
to
want
tax
monies
levied
if
necessary.
they
going
to
want
them
supervised.
they
going
to
want
people
there.
they’re
going
to
say
that
“they’re
not
enough
in
the
black
neighborhoods”,
and
on
and
on.
and
finally,
if
by
freedom
of
choice,
people
go
to
pools
so
that
the
result
is
still
as
he
says
segregated
instead
of
integrated,
then
further
litigation
will
come
from
there.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
1963
sir.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
i
mentioned
at
the
beginning
the
history
of
clark
and
the
fact
that
jackson
accepted
it
immediately.
i
don’t
know
sir,
except
to
say
that
as
i
understand
it,
the
fifth
circuit,
i
believe
held
this
case
some
two
years
--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
he
mentioned
that
sir.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
they
held
it
two
years
to
dissent,
i
believe.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
i
think
what
happened
is
that
when
the
majority
opinion
was
rendered
in
the
fifth
circuit
that
the
other
judges
reserved
the
right
to
file
a
dissenting
opinion
and
this
act
alone
took
two
years,
so
that’s
part
of
the
briefs.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
i
was
going
to
touch
on
that
and
i’m
glad
you
asked
me.
it
maybe,
if
the
court
please
that
some
day,
the
city
of
jackson
will
choose
to
reopen
these
pools
or
build
others.
we
have
a
new
city
administration
in
jackson.
we
don’t
have
a
single
person
on
the
council
that
was
on
the
council
when
this
decision
was
made.
it
may
well
be
that
the
city
of
jackson
will
on
its
own
decide
to
change
this
policy.
on
the
other
hand
it
may
not.
this
is
something
which
i’m
not
prepared
to
say,
but
i
am
prepared
to
say
that
sets
clark,
the
city
of
jackson
is
fully
integrated.
it
has
fully
accepted
clark.
every
public
facility
is
in
full
compliance
with
the
laws
of
the
united
states
and
the
decisions
of
this
court.
and
i
have
no
reason
to
believe
but
that
the
city
officials
in
their
discretion
will
do
the
proper
thing
at
the
proper
time
with
regard
to
swimming
pools
as
well
as
any
other
recreational
facility
in
that
city.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
what
do
i
consider
to
be
the
proper
thing?
i
think
--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
i
think
that
what
that
simply
means
is
what
the
situation
in
jackson,
mississippi
is
at
a
particular
time,
both
insofar
as
friction
is
concerned,
insofar
as
money
is
concerned
and
insofar
as
it’s
overall
recreational
program
is
concerned.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
jackson
is
now
about
175,000
people.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
approximately
60%
white.
back
when
this
suit
was
filed,
i
think
the
record
showed
the
city
was
150,000,
100,000
white,
50,000
black.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
on
the
council?
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
well
we
only
have
a
mayor
and
two
commissioners
who
are
elected
officials.
we
have
--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
the
others
are
appointed.
we
certainly
have
colored
people
working
for
the
city.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
no
sir.
the
county
is
operated
by
a
five-man
board
of
supervisors.
and
that
board
at
the
moment
is
all
white.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
oh,
we’ve
had
blacks
on
the
police
force
for
many
years
in
jackson.
certainly
since
the
time
this
all
originated.
finally,
if
the
court
please,
what
i’d
like
to
leave
with
you
is
that
there
is
a
limit
to
which
this
court
can
reasonably
go
under
the
constitution.
we
can’t
make
constitutional
questions
where
no
constitutional
issue
exists.
this
lawsuit
has
been
handled
from
the
time
it
was
filed
up
until
the
present
time
by
my
senior
partner.
he
was
unable
to
appear
here
and
argue
it
because
of
a
conflict.
it’s
been
an
honor
for
me
to
appear
before
this
court,
and
i
hope
that
the
court
will
not
penalize
the
city
of
jackson
because
we
sent
the
second
team.
this
is
a
serious
case
to
the
city
of
jackson
for
it
honestly
felt
that
the
time
this
decision
was
made
and
honestly
feels
today
that
there
was
no
constitutional
question
presented.
and
in
conclusion,
let
met
remind
the
court
that
this
case
was
filed
on
a
fourteenth
amendment
theory.
the
thirteenth
amendment
argument
came
as
an
afterthought.
that
afterthought
has
been
ignored
by
the
united
states,
but
now
the
afterthought
seems
to
be
the
primary
thrust
of
the
petitioners
who
are
simply
grasping
for
some
way
to
find
the
constitutional
issue
where
none
exists.
we
submit
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
thank
you.
