justice
potter
stewart
there’s
a
statement
on
page
11
of
the
respondent’s
brief
that
rather
intrigued
me.
it’s
just
a
single
sentence
and
it’s
nowhere
elaborated
that
i
could
see
in
either
brief.
statement
is
this
“there
are
integrated
pools
now
available
in
jackson.”
what
was
that?
justice
potter
stewart
but
do
you
not
--
you
don’t
actually
do
what
the
reference
says
here
or
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they
don’t
mix
in
the
squash
courts
either,
if
there
are
no
squash
courts?
justice
potter
stewart
well
now,
it
wasn’t
transferred
to
the
y
was
it?
it
was
owned
by
a
private
owner
and
it
was
leased
by
the
city,
and
then
the
city
terminated
the
lease?
justice
potter
stewart
wasn’t
a
city
property
that
was
transferred
to
private
hands,
that’s
the
opposite
if
anything.
it
was
certainly
not
that
one
either.
justice
potter
stewart
private
property
which
the
city
was
last
seen
and
then
the
city
terminated
the
lease,
wasn’t
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
all
the
city
owned
and
operated
pools
were
closed
and
that’s
what
this
case
is
about
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
think
you
mean
maybe
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
that
time,
1965?
justice
potter
stewart
63?
justice
potter
stewart
the
city
had
charged
admission
when
these
pools
were
operating.
they
were
not
free
were
they?
they
were
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
of
course
in
those
terms,
i
suppose,
all
public
parks
lose
money?
justice
potter
stewart
and
jackson
state
is
a
predominantly
negro
institution?
justice
potter
stewart
and
predominantly
negro
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
operates
this
pool.
it
is
open
to
the
general
public?
justice
potter
stewart
or
only
to
students
of
jackson
state?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
exclusion
of
white
swimmers
there?
justice
potter
stewart
speaking
of
the
constitution
then
of
your
reference
to
freeman,
was
there
any
thirteenth
amendment
claims
made
throughout
this
litigation
until
we
got
here?
justice
potter
stewart
there
was?
justice
potter
stewart
not
on
the
complaint
you
say?
justice
potter
stewart
i
couldn’t
find
any
reference
to
the
thirteenth
amendment
and
the
either
opinion
in
the
court
of
appeals
en
banc,
but
maybe
i
read
it
too
fast.
justice
potter
stewart
yeah,
well
he
talks
about
the,
i
think
the
(inaudible)
something
where
i
have
the
appendix,
towards
the
end
of
the
appendix
it
would
be.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
i
saw
that.
justice
potter
stewart
then
he
says
the
thirteenth,
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments.
that’s
the
only
reference
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
none
on
the
court
opinion?
justice
potter
stewart
court
reading?
justice
potter
stewart

thank
you.
