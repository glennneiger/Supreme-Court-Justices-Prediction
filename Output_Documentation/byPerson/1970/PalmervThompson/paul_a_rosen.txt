mr.
paul
a.
rosen
if
it
please
the
court,
my
name
is
paul
rosen
and
i
along
with
mr.
william
kunstler
will
represent
the
petitioners
in
this
oral
argument.
i
intend
to
discuss
the
fourteenth
amendment
issues
in
this
case.
mr.
kunstler
will
follow
and
discuss
the
thirteenth
amendment
issues.
we
have
raise
section
1981
in
our
brief
and
if
time
permits,
we
will
discuss
it
although
we
feel
that
we
have
amply
covered
in
our
brief.
this
case
represent
but
another
attempt
by
the
city
of
jackson
to
nullify
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendment,
to
avoid
the
decision
of
brown
versus
board
of
education,
and
to
deny
black
people
their
rights
as
guaranteed
by
the
civil
war
amendments.
until
1963,
jackson,
mississippi
operated
its
recreational
facilities
on
a
segregated
basis.
this
is
eight
years
after
this
court
in
the
dawson
case
proclaimed
that
recreational
facilities
should
no
longer
be
operated
on
a
segregated
basis.
but
despite
this,
the
city
of
jackson
maintained
its
policy.
and
so
in
1962
and
’63,
black
citizens
of
jackson,
mississippi
went
to
the
federal
courts
and
asked
those
courts
to
invoke
the
brown
decision
to
desegregate
the
recreational
facilities
in
jackson
including
the
five
municipal
pools.
these
five
pools,
one
of
which
was
leased
from
a
ymca
were
operated
on
this
basis.
for
one-third
of
the
population,
the
black
population
of
jackson,
mississippi,
they
are
one
pool.
for
two-thirds
of
the
population,
the
white
population
of
jackson,
mississippi,
they
had
four
pools.
and
so
this
was
the
situation,
and
this
was
a
situation
which
faced
the
court
in
clark
versus
thompson.
and
in
clark
versus
thompson,
the
court
ordered
that
the
pools
and
the
other
recreational
facilities
would
be
desegregated.
they
must
be
integrated.
this
was
the
law
of
the
land.
and
what
did
the
city
of
jackson,
mississippi
do?
did
they
attempt
to
integrate
the
pools?
did
they
make
any
effort
whatsoever
in
good
faith?
no,
they
did
not.
indeed,
the
city
of
jackson
followed
what
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
called
in
1963
and
it
took
judicial
notice
of
an
official
steel
hard
inflexible
policy
of
official
segregation.
they
closed
the
pools
rather
than
integrate.
and
so
we
have
a
new
form
of
separation
in
jackson,
mississippi.
blacks
and
whites
could
not
swim
in
the
pools
before
clark
versus
thompson.
blacks
and
whites
do
not
swim
in
the
pools
after
clark
versus
thompson.
now
what
the
city
did
was
in
keeping
of
the
statutory
scheme
of
the
state
of
mississippi,
for
the
state
requires
city
officials
to
do
everything
in
their
power,
to
avoid
the
mandate
of
brown,
and
to
prevent
mixing
in
recreational
facilities
including
pools.
now,
the
court
below
found
the
respondents
admit
that
the
purpose
for
closing
the
pools,
the
motive
for
closing
the
pools
was
the
integration
order.
that
fact
is
not
in
dispute
in
this
case
solely
because
they
were
told
that
black
and
white
bodies
must
touch.
that
was
the
catalyst;
that
was
the
action
which
closed
these
pools.
now,
the
city
claims
that
the
problem
is
that
when
you
integrate
pools,
there
might
have
been
violence
and
there
might
have
been
economic
loss,
sheer
speculation,
for
they
never
operated
the
pools
on
an
integrated
basis.
for
other
recreational
facilities
that
had
been
integrated,
have
been
integrated
in
a
peaceful
way,
but
pure
simple
speculation,
and
so
the
situation
is
that
four
pools
are
now
closed.
the
one
pool
that
was
leased
from
the
ymca
was
returned
to
the
ymca.
and
now,
it’s
being
operated
on
a
white
only
basis.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
our
understanding
your
honor
is
that
they
are
closed.
we
have
pictures
if
the
court
is
interested,
which
were
taken
some
two
or
three
weeks
ago
which
indicate
of
course
that
the
water
is
out,
that
there
is
a
minimum
of
maintenance
necessary
to
get
the
pools
back
in
operation.
of
course,
in
the
affidavits
in
this
case,
the
city
maintained
that
they
were
maintained
these
pools
eventhough
they
were
in
a
closed
status.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
yes,
mr.
justice.
i
noted
that
statement
and
i
attempted
to
check
to
see
if
that
statement
was
correct.
i
have
no
facts
which
would
suggest
that
it
is
correct.
i
might
only
suggest
to
the
court
that
it
seems
rather
odd
that
the
city
here
who
proclaims
that
there
will
be
violence,
and
that
there
will
economic
loss
if
they,
the
city,
integrate
pools
suggest
that
a
private
individual
has
been
willing
to
take
on
this
burden,
and
has
opened
an
integrated
pool
without
violence
and
without
economic
loss.
but
as
i
say,
i
had
no
evidence
--
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
no,
i
checked
on
that
and
i
do
not
know.
and
it
is
not
supported
in
the
record
i
might
add.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
no
there
is
not.
what
the
city
has
done
is
to
continue
its
policy
of
segregation.
it
is
taken
this
dramatic
opportunity
to
tell
the
white
citizens
of
jackson,
mississippi
that
should
they
attempt
to
have
close
contact
in
pools
and
elsewhere
that
there
will
be
violence,
and
there
will
be
loss.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
it
is
continuing
--
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
it
has
continued
its
policy
of
segregation
with
respect
to
the
pools,
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
yes.
the
pools
are
there.
the
pools
are
being
paid
for
by
our
respondent’s
tax
monies.
they
sit
there
as
a
monument
to
what
has
occurred
in
this
case.
it
is
no
different
it
seems
to
me
than
what
existed
before
clark
versus
thompson.
black
people
and
white
people
do
not
mix
in
the
pools
of
jackson,
mississippi.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
but
your
honor,
there
are
pools.
this
seems
to
me
no
different
than
the
argument
in
plessy.
it’s
like
saying
that
the
coaches
in
plessy
for
white
people
and
the
coaches
in
plessy
for
black
people
that
whites
could
not
go
in
the
coaches
for
blacks,
and
blacks
could
not
go
in
the
coaches
for
whites.
problem
is
with
this
case
and
with
the
way
this
has
been
handled
is
that
it
totally
avoids
what
brown
has
said
is
the
law
of
this
land,
the
closure
for
the
pool,
the
admitted
motivation
for
closing
the
pool.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
well
--
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
to
create
them?
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
i
don’t
believe
your
honor
that
that
would
be
required.
it
might
be
required
in
all
candid
to
this
court
if
the
city
would
have
had
hearings
and
have
indicated
that
they
had
the
money,
they
had
everything
they
needed
to
open
pools,
but
they
did
not
want
blacks
to
swim
with
whites
and
that’s
why
did
not
open
pools.
of
course,
that’s
not
at
issue
here.
but
what
i
say
in
this
case
is
it
seems
to
me
that
when
this
court
said
in
brown
that
the
action
of
separating
people
created
feelings
of
inferiority
as
to
the
status
of
black
people
in
the
community
that
this
action
is
no
different.
black
people
know
why
the
pools
are
closed.
it’s
not
to
prevent
white
people
from
swimming
with
black
people.
surely,
not
the
respondents
would
stand
here
and
say
that.
it’s
to
prevent
black
people
from
swimming
with
white
people.
it’s
the
same
thinking
and
the
same
thought
that
permitted
in
plessy;
black
and
white
to
be
separated
and
coaches.
and
it
creates
the
same
feelings
of
inferiority.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
yes,
your
honor
that
--
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
well,
in
the
affidavits,
the
city
indicates
that
the
pools
are
still
being
maintained.
that
is,
i
assume
that
they’re
being
taken
care
of
for
change
of
weather;
that
items
are
not
permitted
to
rust.
this
is
all
in
their
affidavit.
the
only
thing
that
we
could
do
because
obviously,
we
could
not
go
in
to
the
pools
was
to
take
pictures
from
the
outside
and
it
appears
--
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
i’m
sorry?
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
i
don’t
know
what
they
mean.
just
looking
at
it,
it
looks
like
it,
will
take
very
little
work
and
the
pools
could
be
back
in
operation.
and
we’d
be
happy
if
the
court
desires
to
show
you
the
pictures
that
we
have
taken
just
two
or
three
weeks
ago.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
that
is
correct
your
honor.
i
think
this
court
said
in
griffin
that
whatever
non-racial
reasons
would
permit
their
schools
to
be
closed.
the
object
must
be
constitutional
and
race
and
opposition
to
immigration
do
not
qualify.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
statement,
that
rule
of
law
applies
to
this
case.
there
is
no
difference.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
just
close
them?
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
well,
they
--
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
they
have
closed
all
pools
your
honor.
if
the
question
--
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
no,
no.
all
pools
have
been
closed
with
the
exception
of
one
pool
which
was
transferred
to
the
y.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
terminated
--
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
that
is
--
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
that
is
correct.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
that’s
right.
the
city
maintains
and
the
court
below
found
that
the
--
while
the
motivation
for
closing
the
pools
was
the
integration
order
that
safety
and
economy
would
be
affected
if
the
pools
were
integrated.
now,
there
was
no
testimony
as
to
any
violence.
there
was
no
testimony
as
to
economic
loss.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
all
they
are
saying
is
that
the
manifestations
of
hatred
and
prejudice
created
by
integration
made
it
in
their
minds
a
problem
to
integrate
the
pools,
to
do
what
the
constitution
requires.
now,
this
court
since
brown,
watson,
innumerable
cases
had
said
that
opposition
to
integration
does
not
afford
a
sufficient
excuse
to
justify
the
denial
of
constitutional
rights.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
i
would
say
--
whatever
the
--
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
yes,
griffin
your
honor.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
griffin.
griffin
held
that
where
a
state
permits
a
county
to
close
a
school,
it
may
do
so
under
certain
circumstances.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
no,
they
did
not
close
all
the
schools,
but
they
dealt
with
the
children
in
the
county
in
the
same
way.
and
this
court
said
that
it’s
not
a
question
of
counties,
it’s
a
question
of
people.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
question
of
power
your
honor;
it
seems
to
me
is
the
state
does
not
have
power
to
violate
the
constitution.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
and
that’s
what's
at
issue
here.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
well,
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
i
believe
that
that’s
the
holding
in
griffin.
now,
the
excuses
of
the
city
have
been
dealt
with
before
by
this
court
in
watson.
they’ve
been
dealt
with
before
in
brown
too.
they
were
dealt
in
green.
they
were
dealt
with
in
cooper
versus
aaron.
each
on
of
these
excuses
are
all
pinned
to
the
same
fact
that
integration,
so
they
speculate,
will
cause
violence
and
will
cause
some
economic
loss.
although,
this
has
not
occurred
in
other
recreational
facilities
that
have
been
integrated
and
although
the
city
of
jackson
never
attempted
once
in
good
faith
to
follow
the
mandate
of
the
court,
to
attempt
to
integrate
its
pools.
now,
the
city
argues
as
a
majority
below
argues
that
the
distinction
in
this
case
really
between
this
and
griffin
is
that
schools
are
essential
and
pools
are
not
essential.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
argument
is
the
same
argument
that
was
made
in
plessy
between
legal
rights
and
political
rights
and
social
rights.
it’s
the
same
kind
of
giving
black
people,
a
little
this
and
a
little
that,
doling
out
rights,
any
right
that
the
white
power
structure
determines
is
important
for
black
people;
they
will
give
them,
and
what
they
determine
is
not
important;
they
will
not.
the
essentialities
argument
is
one
which
if
this
court
were
to
agree
with,
will
create
probably
the
most
horrendous
problems
and
difficulties
for
black
people.
let
me
just
indicate
two
areas
where
this
is
truthful.
when
black
and
a
white
child
go
to
school
together
and
as
they
come
home
from
school,
they
go
by
a
pool
that’s
been
closed
because
the
federal
court
ordered
and
integrated.
does
the
black
child
have
any
doubt
as
to
what
his
status
in
the
community
is?
does
a
black
child
have
any
doubt
that
he
is
inferior?
and
on
the
other
hand,
does
the
white
child
have
any
doubt
that
he
is
superior?
the
essentialities
argument
also
creates
another
problem.
in
schools,
what
classes
are
essential
and
what
classes
are
not
essential?
what
classes
can
be
maintained
in
an
integrated
basis
because
they’re
essential
and
what
classes
can
not
be
maintained
in
an
integrated
basis
because
they
are
not
essential.
i
think
in
viewing
this
case
--
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
that
is
correct.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
i
believe
your
honor
in
the
griffin
case
that
the
court
empowered
the
district
court
to
order
if
necessary.
the
collection
of
taxes
for
the
operation
of
public
schools,
and
so
my
answer
would
be
yes,
this
court
does
have
power
to
order
the
city
of
jackson
to
operate
it’s
pools
in
keeping
with
its
order
in
griffin.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
no
your
honor,
i
do
not.
i
recognize
the
language
in
griffin
talking
about
different
counties.
but
it
really
all
gets
back
to
brown.
it
gets
back
to
what
is
the
letter
of
the
law,
the
feelings
of
inferiority.
and
i
don’t
think
anyone
could
suggest
that
for
black
people
in
jackson,
mississippi
after
they
go
to
court
to
integrate
their
pools
and
the
city
closes
them
because
they
were
ordered
integrated
that
they
have
no
doubt
and
it
does
not
create
feelings
of
inferiority
as
to
their
status
in
the
community.
it
is
brown
which
rules
this
case.
it
is
brown
i
think
that
answers
all
questions
in
this
case.
this
court
in
brown
said
that
the
wall
was
that
black
and
white
have
a
right
to
live
together
and
that
blacks
have
a
right
to
integrate
public
facilities.
let’s
look
at
the
situation
and
let’s
look
what
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
has
done.
black
people
before
brown
went
to
the
court
and
the
court
ordered
that
the
pools
would
be
integrated.
at
that
point,
they
had
one
pool.
under
plessy,
they
had
one
pool.
now,
because
of
brown,
if
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
decision
stands,
they
had
no
pools.
they
were
better
off
with
plessy
than
they
are
with
brown
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court
could
never
have
intended
that
result.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
thank
you.
just
to
go
outside
of
the
record
in
terms,
i
believe
justice
harlan’s
question
concerning
the
status
of
the
pools
on
what
has
occurred.
i
might
say
that
the
black
citizens
did
ask
the
council
this
summer
to
open
the
pools
on
an
integrated
basis.
that
request
was
rejected.
moreover,
the
city’s
position
in
this
case
stated
very
clearly
in
the
affidavits
in
the
proof,
this
is
not
a
transitory
situation.
the
city
says
that
the
city
therefore
decided
not
to
offer
that
type
of
recreational
facility
to
any
of
its
citizens,
and
it
has
not
done
so
and
does
not
intend
to
reopen
any
of
said
pools.
now
we
--
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
if
the
question
is
forever,
if
it
was
purely
an
economic
problem
having
nothing
to
do
with
race
or
opposition
integration,
they
could
handle
that
problem
the
way
any
community
handles
that
problem.
that
is
purely
an
economic
decision.
but
if
it
becomes
a
consideration
of
race
which
creates
the
economic
difficulties,
then
it
seems
to
me
this
court
in
numerous
decisions
has
answered
that
question.
it
answered
it
in
watson,
and
answered
it
in
brown,
and
answered
it
in
green.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
if
the
question
is,
are
they
locked
in
forever
because
of
racial
problems
which
cause
a
rise
in
the
economic
difficulties
in
operating
the
pool?
my
answer
would
be
that
they
would
be
locked
in.
our
hope
in
this
country
is
that
if
we
can
get
white
men
to
accept
blacks
as
equal
that
the
threats
that
respondent
talked
about,
will
soon
leave
us.
this
is
what
the
colonel
commissioner
says.
this
is
what
this
court
really
said
in
brown.
we
know
that
there
are
difficulties
but
the
solution
is
not
repression.
the
solution
is
not
closing
facilities.
the
solution
is
to
abide
by
the
constitution
and
to
say
once
and
for
all
that
black
man
are
freemen,
having
the
same
rights
that
white
men
have.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
yes
your
honor.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
it
was
not
made
in
the
complaint.
it
was
however
urged
--
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
that’s
correct.
the
1981
was.
in
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
en
banc,
the
brief
did
deal
with
the
thirteenth
amendment
--
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
i
believe
if
you’ll
look
at
the
concluding
paragraph
of
judge
wisdom’s
opinion,
i
believe
it’s
the
one.
you
will
see
that
he
talks
about
the
thirteenth,
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendment.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
page
72
and
73.
he
talks
about
dred
scott.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
he
talks
about
subordinate
or
inferior
beings.
he
talks
about
members
--
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
that’s
correct.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
none
in
the
three-judge
court.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
that’s
right.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
the
city
has
maintained
that
we
have
not
sustained
the
burden
of
proof
in
this
case.
proof
in
this
case
was
the
city
was
motivated
by
the
integration
order.
that’s
all
we
need
to
show.
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
mclaughlin,
the
decision
of
this
court
in
watson,
the
decision
of
this
court
in
green,
the
decision
of
many
lower
courts
have
all
said
when
that’s
proven
in
the
context
of
this
case,
they
have
the
burden
of
coming
forward
and
showing
that
it
was
not
discrimination
which
caused
the
closing
of
the
pools.
thank
you.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
thank
you.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
if
it
please
the
court,
my
name
is
paul
rosen
and
i
along
with
mr.
william
kunstler
will
represent
the
petitioners
in
this
oral
argument.
i
intend
to
discuss
the
fourteenth
amendment
issues
in
this
case.
mr.
kunstler
will
follow
and
discuss
the
thirteenth
amendment
issues.
we
have
raise
section
1981
in
our
brief
and
if
time
permits,
we
will
discuss
it
although
we
feel
that
we
have
amply
covered
in
our
brief.
this
case
represent
but
another
attempt
by
the
city
of
jackson
to
nullify
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendment,
to
avoid
the
decision
of
brown
versus
board
of
education,
and
to
deny
black
people
their
rights
as
guaranteed
by
the
civil
war
amendments.
until
1963,
jackson,
mississippi
operated
its
recreational
facilities
on
a
segregated
basis.
this
is
eight
years
after
this
court
in
the
dawson
case
proclaimed
that
recreational
facilities
should
no
longer
be
operated
on
a
segregated
basis.
but
despite
this,
the
city
of
jackson
maintained
its
policy.
and
so
in
1962
and
’63,
black
citizens
of
jackson,
mississippi
went
to
the
federal
courts
and
asked
those
courts
to
invoke
the
brown
decision
to
desegregate
the
recreational
facilities
in
jackson
including
the
five
municipal
pools.
these
five
pools,
one
of
which
was
leased
from
a
ymca
were
operated
on
this
basis.
for
one-third
of
the
population,
the
black
population
of
jackson,
mississippi,
they
are
one
pool.
for
two-thirds
of
the
population,
the
white
population
of
jackson,
mississippi,
they
had
four
pools.
and
so
this
was
the
situation,
and
this
was
a
situation
which
faced
the
court
in
clark
versus
thompson.
and
in
clark
versus
thompson,
the
court
ordered
that
the
pools
and
the
other
recreational
facilities
would
be
desegregated.
they
must
be
integrated.
this
was
the
law
of
the
land.
and
what
did
the
city
of
jackson,
mississippi
do?
did
they
attempt
to
integrate
the
pools?
did
they
make
any
effort
whatsoever
in
good
faith?
no,
they
did
not.
indeed,
the
city
of
jackson
followed
what
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
called
in
1963
and
it
took
judicial
notice
of
an
official
steel
hard
inflexible
policy
of
official
segregation.
they
closed
the
pools
rather
than
integrate.
and
so
we
have
a
new
form
of
separation
in
jackson,
mississippi.
blacks
and
whites
could
not
swim
in
the
pools
before
clark
versus
thompson.
blacks
and
whites
do
not
swim
in
the
pools
after
clark
versus
thompson.
now
what
the
city
did
was
in
keeping
of
the
statutory
scheme
of
the
state
of
mississippi,
for
the
state
requires
city
officials
to
do
everything
in
their
power,
to
avoid
the
mandate
of
brown,
and
to
prevent
mixing
in
recreational
facilities
including
pools.
now,
the
court
below
found
the
respondents
admit
that
the
purpose
for
closing
the
pools,
the
motive
for
closing
the
pools
was
the
integration
order.
that
fact
is
not
in
dispute
in
this
case
solely
because
they
were
told
that
black
and
white
bodies
must
touch.
that
was
the
catalyst;
that
was
the
action
which
closed
these
pools.
now,
the
city
claims
that
the
problem
is
that
when
you
integrate
pools,
there
might
have
been
violence
and
there
might
have
been
economic
loss,
sheer
speculation,
for
they
never
operated
the
pools
on
an
integrated
basis.
for
other
recreational
facilities
that
had
been
integrated,
have
been
integrated
in
a
peaceful
way,
but
pure
simple
speculation,
and
so
the
situation
is
that
four
pools
are
now
closed.
the
one
pool
that
was
leased
from
the
ymca
was
returned
to
the
ymca.
and
now,
it’s
being
operated
on
a
white
only
basis.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
our
understanding
your
honor
is
that
they
are
closed.
we
have
pictures
if
the
court
is
interested,
which
were
taken
some
two
or
three
weeks
ago
which
indicate
of
course
that
the
water
is
out,
that
there
is
a
minimum
of
maintenance
necessary
to
get
the
pools
back
in
operation.
of
course,
in
the
affidavits
in
this
case,
the
city
maintained
that
they
were
maintained
these
pools
eventhough
they
were
in
a
closed
status.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
yes,
mr.
justice.
i
noted
that
statement
and
i
attempted
to
check
to
see
if
that
statement
was
correct.
i
have
no
facts
which
would
suggest
that
it
is
correct.
i
might
only
suggest
to
the
court
that
it
seems
rather
odd
that
the
city
here
who
proclaims
that
there
will
be
violence,
and
that
there
will
economic
loss
if
they,
the
city,
integrate
pools
suggest
that
a
private
individual
has
been
willing
to
take
on
this
burden,
and
has
opened
an
integrated
pool
without
violence
and
without
economic
loss.
but
as
i
say,
i
had
no
evidence
--
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
no,
i
checked
on
that
and
i
do
not
know.
and
it
is
not
supported
in
the
record
i
might
add.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
no
there
is
not.
what
the
city
has
done
is
to
continue
its
policy
of
segregation.
it
is
taken
this
dramatic
opportunity
to
tell
the
white
citizens
of
jackson,
mississippi
that
should
they
attempt
to
have
close
contact
in
pools
and
elsewhere
that
there
will
be
violence,
and
there
will
be
loss.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
it
is
continuing
--
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
it
has
continued
its
policy
of
segregation
with
respect
to
the
pools,
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
yes.
the
pools
are
there.
the
pools
are
being
paid
for
by
our
respondent’s
tax
monies.
they
sit
there
as
a
monument
to
what
has
occurred
in
this
case.
it
is
no
different
it
seems
to
me
than
what
existed
before
clark
versus
thompson.
black
people
and
white
people
do
not
mix
in
the
pools
of
jackson,
mississippi.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
but
your
honor,
there
are
pools.
this
seems
to
me
no
different
than
the
argument
in
plessy.
it’s
like
saying
that
the
coaches
in
plessy
for
white
people
and
the
coaches
in
plessy
for
black
people
that
whites
could
not
go
in
the
coaches
for
blacks,
and
blacks
could
not
go
in
the
coaches
for
whites.
problem
is
with
this
case
and
with
the
way
this
has
been
handled
is
that
it
totally
avoids
what
brown
has
said
is
the
law
of
this
land,
the
closure
for
the
pool,
the
admitted
motivation
for
closing
the
pool.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
well
--
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
to
create
them?
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
i
don’t
believe
your
honor
that
that
would
be
required.
it
might
be
required
in
all
candid
to
this
court
if
the
city
would
have
had
hearings
and
have
indicated
that
they
had
the
money,
they
had
everything
they
needed
to
open
pools,
but
they
did
not
want
blacks
to
swim
with
whites
and
that’s
why
did
not
open
pools.
of
course,
that’s
not
at
issue
here.
but
what
i
say
in
this
case
is
it
seems
to
me
that
when
this
court
said
in
brown
that
the
action
of
separating
people
created
feelings
of
inferiority
as
to
the
status
of
black
people
in
the
community
that
this
action
is
no
different.
black
people
know
why
the
pools
are
closed.
it’s
not
to
prevent
white
people
from
swimming
with
black
people.
surely,
not
the
respondents
would
stand
here
and
say
that.
it’s
to
prevent
black
people
from
swimming
with
white
people.
it’s
the
same
thinking
and
the
same
thought
that
permitted
in
plessy;
black
and
white
to
be
separated
and
coaches.
and
it
creates
the
same
feelings
of
inferiority.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
yes,
your
honor
that
--
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
well,
in
the
affidavits,
the
city
indicates
that
the
pools
are
still
being
maintained.
that
is,
i
assume
that
they’re
being
taken
care
of
for
change
of
weather;
that
items
are
not
permitted
to
rust.
this
is
all
in
their
affidavit.
the
only
thing
that
we
could
do
because
obviously,
we
could
not
go
in
to
the
pools
was
to
take
pictures
from
the
outside
and
it
appears
--
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
i’m
sorry?
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
i
don’t
know
what
they
mean.
just
looking
at
it,
it
looks
like
it,
will
take
very
little
work
and
the
pools
could
be
back
in
operation.
and
we’d
be
happy
if
the
court
desires
to
show
you
the
pictures
that
we
have
taken
just
two
or
three
weeks
ago.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
that
is
correct
your
honor.
i
think
this
court
said
in
griffin
that
whatever
non-racial
reasons
would
permit
their
schools
to
be
closed.
the
object
must
be
constitutional
and
race
and
opposition
to
immigration
do
not
qualify.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
statement,
that
rule
of
law
applies
to
this
case.
there
is
no
difference.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
just
close
them?
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
well,
they
--
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
they
have
closed
all
pools
your
honor.
if
the
question
--
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
no,
no.
all
pools
have
been
closed
with
the
exception
of
one
pool
which
was
transferred
to
the
y.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
terminated
--
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
that
is
--
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
that
is
correct.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
that’s
right.
the
city
maintains
and
the
court
below
found
that
the
--
while
the
motivation
for
closing
the
pools
was
the
integration
order
that
safety
and
economy
would
be
affected
if
the
pools
were
integrated.
now,
there
was
no
testimony
as
to
any
violence.
there
was
no
testimony
as
to
economic
loss.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
all
they
are
saying
is
that
the
manifestations
of
hatred
and
prejudice
created
by
integration
made
it
in
their
minds
a
problem
to
integrate
the
pools,
to
do
what
the
constitution
requires.
now,
this
court
since
brown,
watson,
innumerable
cases
had
said
that
opposition
to
integration
does
not
afford
a
sufficient
excuse
to
justify
the
denial
of
constitutional
rights.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
i
would
say
--
whatever
the
--
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
yes,
griffin
your
honor.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
griffin.
griffin
held
that
where
a
state
permits
a
county
to
close
a
school,
it
may
do
so
under
certain
circumstances.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
no,
they
did
not
close
all
the
schools,
but
they
dealt
with
the
children
in
the
county
in
the
same
way.
and
this
court
said
that
it’s
not
a
question
of
counties,
it’s
a
question
of
people.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
question
of
power
your
honor;
it
seems
to
me
is
the
state
does
not
have
power
to
violate
the
constitution.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
and
that’s
what's
at
issue
here.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
well,
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
i
believe
that
that’s
the
holding
in
griffin.
now,
the
excuses
of
the
city
have
been
dealt
with
before
by
this
court
in
watson.
they’ve
been
dealt
with
before
in
brown
too.
they
were
dealt
in
green.
they
were
dealt
with
in
cooper
versus
aaron.
each
on
of
these
excuses
are
all
pinned
to
the
same
fact
that
integration,
so
they
speculate,
will
cause
violence
and
will
cause
some
economic
loss.
although,
this
has
not
occurred
in
other
recreational
facilities
that
have
been
integrated
and
although
the
city
of
jackson
never
attempted
once
in
good
faith
to
follow
the
mandate
of
the
court,
to
attempt
to
integrate
its
pools.
now,
the
city
argues
as
a
majority
below
argues
that
the
distinction
in
this
case
really
between
this
and
griffin
is
that
schools
are
essential
and
pools
are
not
essential.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
argument
is
the
same
argument
that
was
made
in
plessy
between
legal
rights
and
political
rights
and
social
rights.
it’s
the
same
kind
of
giving
black
people,
a
little
this
and
a
little
that,
doling
out
rights,
any
right
that
the
white
power
structure
determines
is
important
for
black
people;
they
will
give
them,
and
what
they
determine
is
not
important;
they
will
not.
the
essentialities
argument
is
one
which
if
this
court
were
to
agree
with,
will
create
probably
the
most
horrendous
problems
and
difficulties
for
black
people.
let
me
just
indicate
two
areas
where
this
is
truthful.
when
black
and
a
white
child
go
to
school
together
and
as
they
come
home
from
school,
they
go
by
a
pool
that’s
been
closed
because
the
federal
court
ordered
and
integrated.
does
the
black
child
have
any
doubt
as
to
what
his
status
in
the
community
is?
does
a
black
child
have
any
doubt
that
he
is
inferior?
and
on
the
other
hand,
does
the
white
child
have
any
doubt
that
he
is
superior?
the
essentialities
argument
also
creates
another
problem.
in
schools,
what
classes
are
essential
and
what
classes
are
not
essential?
what
classes
can
be
maintained
in
an
integrated
basis
because
they’re
essential
and
what
classes
can
not
be
maintained
in
an
integrated
basis
because
they
are
not
essential.
i
think
in
viewing
this
case
--
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
that
is
correct.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
i
believe
your
honor
in
the
griffin
case
that
the
court
empowered
the
district
court
to
order
if
necessary.
the
collection
of
taxes
for
the
operation
of
public
schools,
and
so
my
answer
would
be
yes,
this
court
does
have
power
to
order
the
city
of
jackson
to
operate
it’s
pools
in
keeping
with
its
order
in
griffin.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
no
your
honor,
i
do
not.
i
recognize
the
language
in
griffin
talking
about
different
counties.
but
it
really
all
gets
back
to
brown.
it
gets
back
to
what
is
the
letter
of
the
law,
the
feelings
of
inferiority.
and
i
don’t
think
anyone
could
suggest
that
for
black
people
in
jackson,
mississippi
after
they
go
to
court
to
integrate
their
pools
and
the
city
closes
them
because
they
were
ordered
integrated
that
they
have
no
doubt
and
it
does
not
create
feelings
of
inferiority
as
to
their
status
in
the
community.
it
is
brown
which
rules
this
case.
it
is
brown
i
think
that
answers
all
questions
in
this
case.
this
court
in
brown
said
that
the
wall
was
that
black
and
white
have
a
right
to
live
together
and
that
blacks
have
a
right
to
integrate
public
facilities.
let’s
look
at
the
situation
and
let’s
look
what
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
has
done.
black
people
before
brown
went
to
the
court
and
the
court
ordered
that
the
pools
would
be
integrated.
at
that
point,
they
had
one
pool.
under
plessy,
they
had
one
pool.
now,
because
of
brown,
if
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
decision
stands,
they
had
no
pools.
they
were
better
off
with
plessy
than
they
are
with
brown
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court
could
never
have
intended
that
result.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
thank
you.
just
to
go
outside
of
the
record
in
terms,
i
believe
justice
harlan’s
question
concerning
the
status
of
the
pools
on
what
has
occurred.
i
might
say
that
the
black
citizens
did
ask
the
council
this
summer
to
open
the
pools
on
an
integrated
basis.
that
request
was
rejected.
moreover,
the
city’s
position
in
this
case
stated
very
clearly
in
the
affidavits
in
the
proof,
this
is
not
a
transitory
situation.
the
city
says
that
the
city
therefore
decided
not
to
offer
that
type
of
recreational
facility
to
any
of
its
citizens,
and
it
has
not
done
so
and
does
not
intend
to
reopen
any
of
said
pools.
now
we
--
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
if
the
question
is
forever,
if
it
was
purely
an
economic
problem
having
nothing
to
do
with
race
or
opposition
integration,
they
could
handle
that
problem
the
way
any
community
handles
that
problem.
that
is
purely
an
economic
decision.
but
if
it
becomes
a
consideration
of
race
which
creates
the
economic
difficulties,
then
it
seems
to
me
this
court
in
numerous
decisions
has
answered
that
question.
it
answered
it
in
watson,
and
answered
it
in
brown,
and
answered
it
in
green.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
if
the
question
is,
are
they
locked
in
forever
because
of
racial
problems
which
cause
a
rise
in
the
economic
difficulties
in
operating
the
pool?
my
answer
would
be
that
they
would
be
locked
in.
our
hope
in
this
country
is
that
if
we
can
get
white
men
to
accept
blacks
as
equal
that
the
threats
that
respondent
talked
about,
will
soon
leave
us.
this
is
what
the
colonel
commissioner
says.
this
is
what
this
court
really
said
in
brown.
we
know
that
there
are
difficulties
but
the
solution
is
not
repression.
the
solution
is
not
closing
facilities.
the
solution
is
to
abide
by
the
constitution
and
to
say
once
and
for
all
that
black
man
are
freemen,
having
the
same
rights
that
white
men
have.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
yes
your
honor.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
it
was
not
made
in
the
complaint.
it
was
however
urged
--
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
that’s
correct.
the
1981
was.
in
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
en
banc,
the
brief
did
deal
with
the
thirteenth
amendment
--
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
i
believe
if
you’ll
look
at
the
concluding
paragraph
of
judge
wisdom’s
opinion,
i
believe
it’s
the
one.
you
will
see
that
he
talks
about
the
thirteenth,
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendment.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
page
72
and
73.
he
talks
about
dred
scott.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
he
talks
about
subordinate
or
inferior
beings.
he
talks
about
members
--
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
that’s
correct.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
none
in
the
three-judge
court.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
that’s
right.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
the
city
has
maintained
that
we
have
not
sustained
the
burden
of
proof
in
this
case.
proof
in
this
case
was
the
city
was
motivated
by
the
integration
order.
that’s
all
we
need
to
show.
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
mclaughlin,
the
decision
of
this
court
in
watson,
the
decision
of
this
court
in
green,
the
decision
of
many
lower
courts
have
all
said
when
that’s
proven
in
the
context
of
this
case,
they
have
the
burden
of
coming
forward
and
showing
that
it
was
not
discrimination
which
caused
the
closing
of
the
pools.
thank
you.
mr.
paul
a.
rosen
thank
you.
