mr.
william
m.
kunstler
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i’m
going
to
carry
on
from
my
brother
rosen
to
the
thirteenth
amendment.
i
recognized
that
you
could
decide
this
case
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
without
much
problem.
but
i
want
to
make
a
strong
an
argument
as
i
can
to
go
further
than
that
and
i’d
like
to
pose
my
argument
this
way.
i
start
from
the
premise
that
the
thirteenth
amendment
abolished
slavery
and
established
universal
freedom
from
mr.
justice
bradley’s
comment
in
the
civil
rights
cases.
and
then
go
to
mr.
justice
stewart
in
jones
against
mayer
were
based
on
the
thirteenth
amendment
and
writing
for
this
court,
he
indicated
that
congress
was
authorized
by
that
amendment
to
pass
all
laws
necessary
and
proper
for
abolishing
all
badges
and
incidents
of
slavery
in
the
united
states.
and
i
remember,
mr.
justice
stewart,
you
emphasized
in
the
opinion,
at
least
in
my
report
those
words.
or
again
as
mr.
justice
stewart
put
it
in
footnote
78
of
the
jones
opinion
that
the
amendment
authorized
congress
to
eradicate
the
last
vestiges
and
incidents
of
a
society
half
slave
and
half
free.
but
mr.
justice
stewart
left
open
the
question.
he
asked
really,
did
the
amendment
itself
do
any
more
than
that?
and
i
want
to
pitch
my
argument
to
the
fact
that
it
did,
in
my
opinion,
do
more
than
that.
our
position
is
a
fundamental
one.
it
is
essentially
that
the
amendment
puts
an
affirmative
duty
on
all
branches
of
government
including
this
court
to
eliminate
all
badges
and
incidents
of
slavery.
it
is
self-executing
if
all
of
the
justices
in
the
civil
rights
case
have
any
meaning.
they
agreed
on
one
thing
that
it
was
a
self-executing
amendment.
and
i
think
mr.
justice
bradley
used
the
words
by
its
terms
was
applicable
to
any
existing
set
of
circumstances.
we
come
here
with
one
of
those
existing
set
of
circumstances.
if
the
amendment
did
abolish
slavery
truly
and
it
did
establish
universal
freedom,
then
our
position
is
that
it
gives
this
court
the
power
independent
of
any
act
of
congress,
the
power
to
abolish
any
incident
of
slavery.
in
other
words,
it
authorized
all
branches
of
government.
the
executive,
legislative
and
judicial
to
do
everything
and
i’ll
quote
again
from
the
civil
rights
cases,
“everything
necessary
and
proper
for
abolishing
all
badges
and
incidents
of
slavery
in
the
united
states.”
and
i
guess
the
question
your
honors
comes
down
to
this.
what
is
the
badge
in
incident
of
slavery?
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
absolutely.
there
could
be
no
more
badge
of
slavery.
in
fact,
that’s
so
typical
a
badge
of
slavery.
the
black
people
couldn’t
be
educated
at
all
was
one
of
the
elements
of
the
slave
state.
in
fact,
it
was
a
crime,
mr.
justice
harlan
as
you
know
in
many
states,
to
educate
black
people
and
one
punishable
by
death.
question
is
what
is
a
badge
or
incident
of
slavery
and
i
go
to
mr.
justice
douglas
because
in
jones,
he
lists
the
whole
number
of
things
which
he
indicates
are
badges
of
slavery.
talks
about
voting
restrictions,
exclusions
from
jury,
segregated
courtrooms,
segregated
schools,
denial
of
educational
benefits
in
higher
institutions
of
learning,
marriage,
marrying
outside
of
one’s
race,
living
in
segregated
ghettos,
riding
in
segregated
railroads
or
enjoying
life
in
segregated
public
parks,
restaurants,
public
beaches,
municipal
golf
courses,
amusement
parks,
buses,
public
libraries,
etcetera,
and
being
referred
to
by
one’s
first
name
as
mary
hamilton
was
in
an
alabama
court,
even
if
she
happens
to
be
an
adult
woman.
i
would
like
to
utilize
what
mr.
justice
douglas
included
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
jones,
what
frederick
douglas
said,
because
he
said
and
i
think,
and
i
have
to
speak
from
a
black
man’s
viewpoint
“yeah,
that’s
impossible
being
a
white
man.
all
i
can
say
is
what
he
said.
and
he
said
the
black
man
has
seized
to
be
the
slave
of
an
individual
but
has
in
some
sense
become
the
slave
of
society.”
and
that’s
where
we
are
here.
he
is
the
slave
of
society.
he
has
an
incident
of
slavery.
he
cannot
swim
in
the
pools
next
to
white
people
because
of
all
the
sexual
and
metaphysical
connotations
of
water
and
contact
of
bodies,
what
mr.
justice
douglas
observed
about
motels
which
have
swimming
pools.
i
think
the
general
definition
that
we
would
like
to
urge
upon
this
court
is
that
an
incident
of
slavery
is
anything
that
makes
a
black
man
reasonably
feel
inferior
to
a
white
man.
it’s
the
opposite
of
what
mr.
justice
brown
said
in
plessy.
he
said
if
the
black
race
chooses
to
put
that
interpretation
upon
writing
in
segregated
coaches,
that’s
their
lookout,
not
ours.
but
i
submit
that
it
is
your
lookout,
our
lookout
because
this
court
is
really
nothing
more
than
an
extension
of
the
american
personality,
an
extension
of
the
american
sociology.
i
would
put
it
in
other
way
as
a
badge
or
incident
of
slavery
anything
that
would
downgrade
the
concept
of
national
citizenship
as
envisioned
in
the
war
timed
amendments
would
be
a
badge
of
slavery.
it’s
as
mr.
justice
douglas
said
“things
that
have
remained
in
the
minds
and
hearts
of
many
white
men.”
and
i
think
he’s
charitable
by
adding
the
adjective
“many”
in
front
of
the
words
white
men.
now
what
makes
a
black
man
feel
inferior
to
a
white
man?
it’s
any
act
which
he
can
reasonably
construe
at
something
which
stamps
him
with
a
badge
of
inferiority.
and
some
of
these
things
i’ve
indicated
from
mr.
justice
douglas’s
dissent
--concurring
opinion
in
jones,
but
they
all
have
a
common
thread.
they
emphasize
unequal
status.
they
remind
black
people
that
they
once
were
chattels
to
be
bought
and
sold
like
cows
and
sheep
in
the
united
states.
now,
does
the
closing
of
the
pools,
the
swimming
and
wetting
pools
do
that?
we
say
it
does.
and
i
set
forth
in
my
argument
a
number
of
reasons
why
it
does.
one,
to
ask
a
few
questions:
what
construction
will
a
black
person
put
on
the
closing
of
the
pools?
it’s
a
different
construction
than
a
white
person.
a
white
person
will
be
inconvenienced.
he
won’t
swim
also,
that’s
true.
but
to
him,
it
doesn’t
mean
that
he
was
once
a
slave.
it
only
means
that
because
there
is
an
inferior
race
that
some
judicial
system
has
said
“may
swim
with
him”
that
that
inferior
race
is
not
going
to
swim
with
him.
but
for
the
black
man,
it
has
a
wholly
different
meaning.
it
means
he’s
not
good
or
clean
enough
to
swim
with
white
people.
in
judge
wisdom’s
dissent,
i
think
he
perceptively
saw
that
down
in
new
orleans
with
the
flood
of
cases
that
come
through
with
the
fifth
circuit.
he
said
“we
should
recognize
the
actual
traumatic
effect
of
the
action
on
negroes
for
what
it
was.”
and
i
think
unless
this
court
recognized
what
these
things
do
to
black
people,
then
i
guess
we’re
in
for
a
very
hard
time
in
the
united
states.
no
black
person
could
fail
to
get
the
message
about
the
closing
of
the
pools
meant.
mayor
thompson
put
it
very
coldly
“we
are
not
going
to
have
any
intermingling
in
the
pools.”
and
as
justice
douglas
said
in
his
concurrence
in
jones,
“a
vacancy
sign
at
a
motel
doesn’t
mean
what
it
says
especially
if
the
motel
has
a
swimming
pool.”
mr.
justice
douglas
as
a
white
man
must
understand
what
it
means
to
mingle
in
the
pools.
why
there
is
such
unholy
opposition
to
that
contact.
the
second
question
is
who
did
it?
and
the
white
community
did
it.
just
as
the
white
community
segregated
the
railroad
that
ran
around
a
bunch
of
train
in
plessy
against
ferguson,
so
the
white
community
in
jackson
closed
the
pools.
why
did
they
do
it?
next
inquiry;
to
avoid
integration.
why
avoid
integration?
because
black
people
are
beings
of
an
inferior
order
and
altogether,
unfit
to
associate
with
the
white
race
either
in
social
or
political
relations.
that’s
just
mr.
chief
justice
charley,
he
saw
it
quite
clearly.
or
he
said
in
another
way
“this
is
by
way
we
erect
a
perpetual
an
impossible
barrier
between
the
races.”
or
another
way
“we
must
separate
the
unhappy
black
race
from
the
white
by
indelible
marks,
”
or
finally,
“we
impress
deep
and
enduring
marks
of
inferiority
and
degradation
on
black
people.”
and
that
is
the
heart
of
this
case.
that
is
why
i
think
the
court
must
take
a
stand
and
say
“yes,
the
closing
of
the
pools
violates
the
thirteenth
amendment.
that
we
as
a
court
have
just
as
much
responsibility
as
congress,
just
as
much
responsibility
as
the
executive
in
wiping
out
these
badges,
because
unless
they
are
wiped
out,
no
black
person
can
feel
secure
in
the
united
states
and
every
black
person
will
begin
eventually
to
build
up
a
rage
that
is
already
sufficient
enough
that
will
build
up
a
rage
inside
that
he
knows
that
in
white
eyes,
he
is
an
inferior
person.”
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
they
would.
but
i
think
there
are
some
areas
that
are
very
difficult
to
legislate
on.
legislation
is
peculiarly
proper
for
general
situations.
but
to
pick
out
every
badge
of
slavery
and
isolate
it
by
legislation
is
i
think
impossible.
that’s
where
i
think
this
court
comes
into
the
picture.
there
are
these
areas.
like
the
swimming
pools
in
jackson
where
i
think
the
court
may
have
peculiar
responsibility,
where
the
court
is
maybe
the
only
barrier.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
that’s
true
mr.
chief
justice
but
not
the
closing
of
a
swimming
pool.
you’re
talking
about
areas
whether
they’re
available
and
open.
a
swimming
pool
would
be
a
public
accommodation
under
the
civil
rights
act
of
’64.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
that’s
a
one
--
that’s
a
little
harder
for
me
to
answer.
i
would
say
no.
i
take
the
fact
that
that
would
be
if
it
were
in
a
way
of
emphasizing
inferiority
of
women,
i
would
argue
on
that
score.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
i
would
see
a
little
different
situation
there.
despite
what
women’s
liberation
movement
feels,
women
were
not
true
slaves
in
this
country.
they
have
a
lot
of
the
incidents,
i
think,
but
they
weren't
true
slaves
as
black
people
were.
there’s
a
whole
different
set
of
facts,
if
you
do
it
to
keep
black
people
from
swimming
with
white
people
because
black
people
are
inferior,
that’s
a
little
different
between
separating
the
sexes
as
they
do
for
example,
mr.
chief
justice,
where
people
swim
nude.
they
do
separate
the
sexes
in
one
pool
or
another,
or
have
different
hours.
that’s
a
logical
distinction
to
me.
that’s
reasonable.
that’s
not
the
inferiority
of
anybody.
that’s
a
morality
question.
but
if
you
did
it
where
people
wore
bathing
suits,
unless
it
were
in
the
area
of
the
inferiority
of
women
being
proclaimed
in
some
way,
then
i
think
it’s
a
different
picture
than
we
have
here.
everything
here
comes
out
of
the
historical
mammoth
fact
that
black
people
were
slaves.
and
if
you
do
this,
if
you
close
these
pools
this
way,
which
is
not
covered
by
the
civil
rights
act
because
there
are
no
pools
to
be
integrated.
this
is
an
unusual
situation.
this
is
closing
the
facility
for
everybody
because
you
don’t
want
one
element
of
the
population
to
swim
with
another.
and
i
think
that’s
a
peculiar
area
for
this
court.
i
think
it’s
an
important
area
for
this
court.
i
thought
mr.
justice
stewart
was
pointing
the
way
by
his
unanswered
question.
i’m
trying
to
get
the
court
to
answer
of
the
question
that
mr.
justice
stewart
posed
in
jones.
and
i
think
it’s
a
question
that
has
to
be
answered.
i
realized
that
the
tendency
of
the
court
is
to
go
into
a
much
explored
area,
which
would
be
the
fourteenth
amendment
certainly.
but
i’m
indicating
that
there
are
responsibilities
of
the
court
as
well.
and
i
think
this
is
an
area
where
the
case
that
mr.
justice
stewart
might
have
been
imagining,
has
now
arrived
at
the
court.
you
have
two
or
three
roads
which
you
could
take.
i’m
asking
you
essentially
to
take
the
road
of
the
broad
sweep
of
judicial
power
and
to
declare
that
the
court
independently
of
congress
moving
and
it
may
never
move
in
this
area.
indeed,
as
mr.
chief
justice
burger’s
question
has
indicated,
it
maybe
an
area
where
you
can’t
legislate.
maybe,
a
unique
area
and
there
are
many
unique
areas
of
this
so
they
can’t
be
imagined.
i
would
like
to
indicate
just
briefly
in
closing
that
i
thought
that
the
first,
mr.
justice
harlan
saw
clearly
what
courts
should
do
in
situations
like
this.
he
made
both
a
poetic
and
i
think
an
accurate
observation
in
the
civil
rights
dissent.
he
said
“it
is
not
the
words
of
the
law,
but
the
internal
sense
of
it
that
makes
the
law.
the
letter
of
the
law
is
the
body.
the
sense
and
reason
of
the
law
is
the
soul.
and
i
am
appealing
to
the
soul
of
the
law
both
for
practically,
humanitarian
and
ethical
and
philosophical
considerations.”
he
went
on
to
add
that
there
cannot
be
in
this
republic
any
class
of
human
beings
in
practical
subjection
to
another
class
with
power
in
the
latter
to
dole
out
to
the
format
just
such
privileges
as
they
may
choose
to
grant.
the
class
that
has
one
in
subjection
has
now
withdrawn
a
facility
which
was
open
to
all.
one
pool
segregated
for
blacks,
four
for
whites.
they
add,
as
mr.
justice
stewart
indicated,
it
gotten
rid
of
one
and
we
can
leave
that
out
of
consideration
(inaudible).
but
they
have
taken
the
other
four
and
closed
them,
maintained
them
and
they
are
determined
that
black
and
white
body
shall
not
mingle
in
them.
that
is
putting
black
people
in
practical
subjection
to
another
class.
and
that
is
what
under
our
law.
this
court,
i
feel
very
personally
and
emotionally
that
this
court
must
say
answers
the
question
that
your
brother
posed
in
jones.
what
is
the
full
extent
of
the
thirteenth
amendment,
that
amendment
that
started
in
such
fire
and
flamboyance
and
with
such
high
hopes
and
is
now
taken
almost
a
hundred
years
just
to
resuscitate
as
you
did
in
jones
one
portion
of
it,
the
right
to
buy
a
home
in
patrick
woods.
it
goes
much
further
than
that.
it
must
make
black
people
feel
that
they
have
the
same
status
as
white
people
and
truly
feel
that
in
the
deepest
heart,
unless
they
do,
i
am
certain
that
the
rage
will
consume
the
body.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
before
we
go,
my
i
introduce,
we
have
two
young
men
at
the
play.
i
know
it
may
be
a
little
unusual,
but
they
did
work
very
hard
in
brief
--
worked
on
the
amicus
brief.
so,
i’d
like
to
tell
the
court
and
william
hoe
as
it
was
co-counsel
with
its
opposite
appellate
brief.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
and
then
william
goodman
who
worked
with
us.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i’m
going
to
carry
on
from
my
brother
rosen
to
the
thirteenth
amendment.
i
recognized
that
you
could
decide
this
case
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
without
much
problem.
but
i
want
to
make
a
strong
an
argument
as
i
can
to
go
further
than
that
and
i’d
like
to
pose
my
argument
this
way.
i
start
from
the
premise
that
the
thirteenth
amendment
abolished
slavery
and
established
universal
freedom
from
mr.
justice
bradley’s
comment
in
the
civil
rights
cases.
and
then
go
to
mr.
justice
stewart
in
jones
against
mayer
were
based
on
the
thirteenth
amendment
and
writing
for
this
court,
he
indicated
that
congress
was
authorized
by
that
amendment
to
pass
all
laws
necessary
and
proper
for
abolishing
all
badges
and
incidents
of
slavery
in
the
united
states.
and
i
remember,
mr.
justice
stewart,
you
emphasized
in
the
opinion,
at
least
in
my
report
those
words.
or
again
as
mr.
justice
stewart
put
it
in
footnote
78
of
the
jones
opinion
that
the
amendment
authorized
congress
to
eradicate
the
last
vestiges
and
incidents
of
a
society
half
slave
and
half
free.
but
mr.
justice
stewart
left
open
the
question.
he
asked
really,
did
the
amendment
itself
do
any
more
than
that?
and
i
want
to
pitch
my
argument
to
the
fact
that
it
did,
in
my
opinion,
do
more
than
that.
our
position
is
a
fundamental
one.
it
is
essentially
that
the
amendment
puts
an
affirmative
duty
on
all
branches
of
government
including
this
court
to
eliminate
all
badges
and
incidents
of
slavery.
it
is
self-executing
if
all
of
the
justices
in
the
civil
rights
case
have
any
meaning.
they
agreed
on
one
thing
that
it
was
a
self-executing
amendment.
and
i
think
mr.
justice
bradley
used
the
words
by
its
terms
was
applicable
to
any
existing
set
of
circumstances.
we
come
here
with
one
of
those
existing
set
of
circumstances.
if
the
amendment
did
abolish
slavery
truly
and
it
did
establish
universal
freedom,
then
our
position
is
that
it
gives
this
court
the
power
independent
of
any
act
of
congress,
the
power
to
abolish
any
incident
of
slavery.
in
other
words,
it
authorized
all
branches
of
government.
the
executive,
legislative
and
judicial
to
do
everything
and
i’ll
quote
again
from
the
civil
rights
cases,
“everything
necessary
and
proper
for
abolishing
all
badges
and
incidents
of
slavery
in
the
united
states.”
and
i
guess
the
question
your
honors
comes
down
to
this.
what
is
the
badge
in
incident
of
slavery?
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
absolutely.
there
could
be
no
more
badge
of
slavery.
in
fact,
that’s
so
typical
a
badge
of
slavery.
the
black
people
couldn’t
be
educated
at
all
was
one
of
the
elements
of
the
slave
state.
in
fact,
it
was
a
crime,
mr.
justice
harlan
as
you
know
in
many
states,
to
educate
black
people
and
one
punishable
by
death.
question
is
what
is
a
badge
or
incident
of
slavery
and
i
go
to
mr.
justice
douglas
because
in
jones,
he
lists
the
whole
number
of
things
which
he
indicates
are
badges
of
slavery.
talks
about
voting
restrictions,
exclusions
from
jury,
segregated
courtrooms,
segregated
schools,
denial
of
educational
benefits
in
higher
institutions
of
learning,
marriage,
marrying
outside
of
one’s
race,
living
in
segregated
ghettos,
riding
in
segregated
railroads
or
enjoying
life
in
segregated
public
parks,
restaurants,
public
beaches,
municipal
golf
courses,
amusement
parks,
buses,
public
libraries,
etcetera,
and
being
referred
to
by
one’s
first
name
as
mary
hamilton
was
in
an
alabama
court,
even
if
she
happens
to
be
an
adult
woman.
i
would
like
to
utilize
what
mr.
justice
douglas
included
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
jones,
what
frederick
douglas
said,
because
he
said
and
i
think,
and
i
have
to
speak
from
a
black
man’s
viewpoint
“yeah,
that’s
impossible
being
a
white
man.
all
i
can
say
is
what
he
said.
and
he
said
the
black
man
has
seized
to
be
the
slave
of
an
individual
but
has
in
some
sense
become
the
slave
of
society.”
and
that’s
where
we
are
here.
he
is
the
slave
of
society.
he
has
an
incident
of
slavery.
he
cannot
swim
in
the
pools
next
to
white
people
because
of
all
the
sexual
and
metaphysical
connotations
of
water
and
contact
of
bodies,
what
mr.
justice
douglas
observed
about
motels
which
have
swimming
pools.
i
think
the
general
definition
that
we
would
like
to
urge
upon
this
court
is
that
an
incident
of
slavery
is
anything
that
makes
a
black
man
reasonably
feel
inferior
to
a
white
man.
it’s
the
opposite
of
what
mr.
justice
brown
said
in
plessy.
he
said
if
the
black
race
chooses
to
put
that
interpretation
upon
writing
in
segregated
coaches,
that’s
their
lookout,
not
ours.
but
i
submit
that
it
is
your
lookout,
our
lookout
because
this
court
is
really
nothing
more
than
an
extension
of
the
american
personality,
an
extension
of
the
american
sociology.
i
would
put
it
in
other
way
as
a
badge
or
incident
of
slavery
anything
that
would
downgrade
the
concept
of
national
citizenship
as
envisioned
in
the
war
timed
amendments
would
be
a
badge
of
slavery.
it’s
as
mr.
justice
douglas
said
“things
that
have
remained
in
the
minds
and
hearts
of
many
white
men.”
and
i
think
he’s
charitable
by
adding
the
adjective
“many”
in
front
of
the
words
white
men.
now
what
makes
a
black
man
feel
inferior
to
a
white
man?
it’s
any
act
which
he
can
reasonably
construe
at
something
which
stamps
him
with
a
badge
of
inferiority.
and
some
of
these
things
i’ve
indicated
from
mr.
justice
douglas’s
dissent
--concurring
opinion
in
jones,
but
they
all
have
a
common
thread.
they
emphasize
unequal
status.
they
remind
black
people
that
they
once
were
chattels
to
be
bought
and
sold
like
cows
and
sheep
in
the
united
states.
now,
does
the
closing
of
the
pools,
the
swimming
and
wetting
pools
do
that?
we
say
it
does.
and
i
set
forth
in
my
argument
a
number
of
reasons
why
it
does.
one,
to
ask
a
few
questions:
what
construction
will
a
black
person
put
on
the
closing
of
the
pools?
it’s
a
different
construction
than
a
white
person.
a
white
person
will
be
inconvenienced.
he
won’t
swim
also,
that’s
true.
but
to
him,
it
doesn’t
mean
that
he
was
once
a
slave.
it
only
means
that
because
there
is
an
inferior
race
that
some
judicial
system
has
said
“may
swim
with
him”
that
that
inferior
race
is
not
going
to
swim
with
him.
but
for
the
black
man,
it
has
a
wholly
different
meaning.
it
means
he’s
not
good
or
clean
enough
to
swim
with
white
people.
in
judge
wisdom’s
dissent,
i
think
he
perceptively
saw
that
down
in
new
orleans
with
the
flood
of
cases
that
come
through
with
the
fifth
circuit.
he
said
“we
should
recognize
the
actual
traumatic
effect
of
the
action
on
negroes
for
what
it
was.”
and
i
think
unless
this
court
recognized
what
these
things
do
to
black
people,
then
i
guess
we’re
in
for
a
very
hard
time
in
the
united
states.
no
black
person
could
fail
to
get
the
message
about
the
closing
of
the
pools
meant.
mayor
thompson
put
it
very
coldly
“we
are
not
going
to
have
any
intermingling
in
the
pools.”
and
as
justice
douglas
said
in
his
concurrence
in
jones,
“a
vacancy
sign
at
a
motel
doesn’t
mean
what
it
says
especially
if
the
motel
has
a
swimming
pool.”
mr.
justice
douglas
as
a
white
man
must
understand
what
it
means
to
mingle
in
the
pools.
why
there
is
such
unholy
opposition
to
that
contact.
the
second
question
is
who
did
it?
and
the
white
community
did
it.
just
as
the
white
community
segregated
the
railroad
that
ran
around
a
bunch
of
train
in
plessy
against
ferguson,
so
the
white
community
in
jackson
closed
the
pools.
why
did
they
do
it?
next
inquiry;
to
avoid
integration.
why
avoid
integration?
because
black
people
are
beings
of
an
inferior
order
and
altogether,
unfit
to
associate
with
the
white
race
either
in
social
or
political
relations.
that’s
just
mr.
chief
justice
charley,
he
saw
it
quite
clearly.
or
he
said
in
another
way
“this
is
by
way
we
erect
a
perpetual
an
impossible
barrier
between
the
races.”
or
another
way
“we
must
separate
the
unhappy
black
race
from
the
white
by
indelible
marks,
”
or
finally,
“we
impress
deep
and
enduring
marks
of
inferiority
and
degradation
on
black
people.”
and
that
is
the
heart
of
this
case.
that
is
why
i
think
the
court
must
take
a
stand
and
say
“yes,
the
closing
of
the
pools
violates
the
thirteenth
amendment.
that
we
as
a
court
have
just
as
much
responsibility
as
congress,
just
as
much
responsibility
as
the
executive
in
wiping
out
these
badges,
because
unless
they
are
wiped
out,
no
black
person
can
feel
secure
in
the
united
states
and
every
black
person
will
begin
eventually
to
build
up
a
rage
that
is
already
sufficient
enough
that
will
build
up
a
rage
inside
that
he
knows
that
in
white
eyes,
he
is
an
inferior
person.”
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
they
would.
but
i
think
there
are
some
areas
that
are
very
difficult
to
legislate
on.
legislation
is
peculiarly
proper
for
general
situations.
but
to
pick
out
every
badge
of
slavery
and
isolate
it
by
legislation
is
i
think
impossible.
that’s
where
i
think
this
court
comes
into
the
picture.
there
are
these
areas.
like
the
swimming
pools
in
jackson
where
i
think
the
court
may
have
peculiar
responsibility,
where
the
court
is
maybe
the
only
barrier.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
that’s
true
mr.
chief
justice
but
not
the
closing
of
a
swimming
pool.
you’re
talking
about
areas
whether
they’re
available
and
open.
a
swimming
pool
would
be
a
public
accommodation
under
the
civil
rights
act
of
’64.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
that’s
a
one
--
that’s
a
little
harder
for
me
to
answer.
i
would
say
no.
i
take
the
fact
that
that
would
be
if
it
were
in
a
way
of
emphasizing
inferiority
of
women,
i
would
argue
on
that
score.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
i
would
see
a
little
different
situation
there.
despite
what
women’s
liberation
movement
feels,
women
were
not
true
slaves
in
this
country.
they
have
a
lot
of
the
incidents,
i
think,
but
they
weren't
true
slaves
as
black
people
were.
there’s
a
whole
different
set
of
facts,
if
you
do
it
to
keep
black
people
from
swimming
with
white
people
because
black
people
are
inferior,
that’s
a
little
different
between
separating
the
sexes
as
they
do
for
example,
mr.
chief
justice,
where
people
swim
nude.
they
do
separate
the
sexes
in
one
pool
or
another,
or
have
different
hours.
that’s
a
logical
distinction
to
me.
that’s
reasonable.
that’s
not
the
inferiority
of
anybody.
that’s
a
morality
question.
but
if
you
did
it
where
people
wore
bathing
suits,
unless
it
were
in
the
area
of
the
inferiority
of
women
being
proclaimed
in
some
way,
then
i
think
it’s
a
different
picture
than
we
have
here.
everything
here
comes
out
of
the
historical
mammoth
fact
that
black
people
were
slaves.
and
if
you
do
this,
if
you
close
these
pools
this
way,
which
is
not
covered
by
the
civil
rights
act
because
there
are
no
pools
to
be
integrated.
this
is
an
unusual
situation.
this
is
closing
the
facility
for
everybody
because
you
don’t
want
one
element
of
the
population
to
swim
with
another.
and
i
think
that’s
a
peculiar
area
for
this
court.
i
think
it’s
an
important
area
for
this
court.
i
thought
mr.
justice
stewart
was
pointing
the
way
by
his
unanswered
question.
i’m
trying
to
get
the
court
to
answer
of
the
question
that
mr.
justice
stewart
posed
in
jones.
and
i
think
it’s
a
question
that
has
to
be
answered.
i
realized
that
the
tendency
of
the
court
is
to
go
into
a
much
explored
area,
which
would
be
the
fourteenth
amendment
certainly.
but
i’m
indicating
that
there
are
responsibilities
of
the
court
as
well.
and
i
think
this
is
an
area
where
the
case
that
mr.
justice
stewart
might
have
been
imagining,
has
now
arrived
at
the
court.
you
have
two
or
three
roads
which
you
could
take.
i’m
asking
you
essentially
to
take
the
road
of
the
broad
sweep
of
judicial
power
and
to
declare
that
the
court
independently
of
congress
moving
and
it
may
never
move
in
this
area.
indeed,
as
mr.
chief
justice
burger’s
question
has
indicated,
it
maybe
an
area
where
you
can’t
legislate.
maybe,
a
unique
area
and
there
are
many
unique
areas
of
this
so
they
can’t
be
imagined.
i
would
like
to
indicate
just
briefly
in
closing
that
i
thought
that
the
first,
mr.
justice
harlan
saw
clearly
what
courts
should
do
in
situations
like
this.
he
made
both
a
poetic
and
i
think
an
accurate
observation
in
the
civil
rights
dissent.
he
said
“it
is
not
the
words
of
the
law,
but
the
internal
sense
of
it
that
makes
the
law.
the
letter
of
the
law
is
the
body.
the
sense
and
reason
of
the
law
is
the
soul.
and
i
am
appealing
to
the
soul
of
the
law
both
for
practically,
humanitarian
and
ethical
and
philosophical
considerations.”
he
went
on
to
add
that
there
cannot
be
in
this
republic
any
class
of
human
beings
in
practical
subjection
to
another
class
with
power
in
the
latter
to
dole
out
to
the
format
just
such
privileges
as
they
may
choose
to
grant.
the
class
that
has
one
in
subjection
has
now
withdrawn
a
facility
which
was
open
to
all.
one
pool
segregated
for
blacks,
four
for
whites.
they
add,
as
mr.
justice
stewart
indicated,
it
gotten
rid
of
one
and
we
can
leave
that
out
of
consideration
(inaudible).
but
they
have
taken
the
other
four
and
closed
them,
maintained
them
and
they
are
determined
that
black
and
white
body
shall
not
mingle
in
them.
that
is
putting
black
people
in
practical
subjection
to
another
class.
and
that
is
what
under
our
law.
this
court,
i
feel
very
personally
and
emotionally
that
this
court
must
say
answers
the
question
that
your
brother
posed
in
jones.
what
is
the
full
extent
of
the
thirteenth
amendment,
that
amendment
that
started
in
such
fire
and
flamboyance
and
with
such
high
hopes
and
is
now
taken
almost
a
hundred
years
just
to
resuscitate
as
you
did
in
jones
one
portion
of
it,
the
right
to
buy
a
home
in
patrick
woods.
it
goes
much
further
than
that.
it
must
make
black
people
feel
that
they
have
the
same
status
as
white
people
and
truly
feel
that
in
the
deepest
heart,
unless
they
do,
i
am
certain
that
the
rage
will
consume
the
body.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
before
we
go,
my
i
introduce,
we
have
two
young
men
at
the
play.
i
know
it
may
be
a
little
unusual,
but
they
did
work
very
hard
in
brief
--
worked
on
the
amicus
brief.
so,
i’d
like
to
tell
the
court
and
william
hoe
as
it
was
co-counsel
with
its
opposite
appellate
brief.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
and
then
william
goodman
who
worked
with
us.
