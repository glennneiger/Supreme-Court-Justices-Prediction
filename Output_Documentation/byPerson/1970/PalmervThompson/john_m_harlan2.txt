well,
is
there
any
non
segregated
pool
now,
city
operated
none
segregated
pool
in
jackson?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you’ve
said
that
the
--
as
i
understood
it,
the
closed
pool
was
formally
operated
by
the
city
is
still
being
maintained?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
supposing
one
has
to
agree
with
you
in
your
basic
argument.
one
of
the
factors
as
i
understood
it
which
was
accepted
by
the
yard
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
opinion
written
by
judge
rimes
was
in
the
city
could
not
economically
operate
these
pools
on
a
desegregated
basis,
is
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
alright,
now
assumingly
agree
with
you,
has
this
court
got
power
to
order
the
local
fiscal
authority
to
appropriate
state
money,
to
implement
a
decision
which
on
the
assumptions
of
my
question
would
be
that
it
cannot
close
down
this
school
for
the
reasons
that
you’ve
given?
justice
john
m.
harlan
suppose
your
argument
is
that
the
school
cases
could’ve
gone
under
the
thirteenth
amendment
rather
than
fourteenth?
justice
john
m.
harlan
assuming
that’s
all
you
have
the
economic
thing,
would
that
be
a
constitutional
defense?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
do
you
do
if
you
--
against
war
all
the
way
back?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
what
i’ll
be
getting,
of
course
the
record
that
--
could
you
say
would
there
has
been
any
changes
in
the
situation
between
1963
to
1970,
and
why
seven
years?
justice
john
m.

what
do
you
consider
to
be
the
proper
