your
clients
are
--
who
is
--
mrs.
moore
and
others?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
need
to
know
their
names,
i'm
rather
just
--
in
that,
but
they
are
the
parents
of
white
public
school
children
as
well
as
of
negro
public
school
children
or
only
white
public
school
children?
justice
potter
stewart
both.
justice
potter
stewart
your
argument
is
based
entirely
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
and
not
at
all
on
a
federal
statute,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
entirely
on
the
constitution?
justice
potter
stewart
and
your
clients
are
the
parents
of
school
children.
they're
no
teachers.
you
don't
represent
any
teachers
in
the
charlotte
public
school
system?
justice
potter
stewart
and
therefore
you
are
making
no
claim
with
respect
to
the
constitutionality
vel
non
of
the
integration
of
faculty?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
there
is
no
compulsion
involved,
would
you
still
say
it's
invalid.
i
thought
your
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
attention
were
that
it
was
a
very
compulsory
assignments.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
that
was
still
dual
zone.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
wagoner.
justice
potter
stewart
since
we
are
addressing
to
some
factual
matters,
there
would
be
a
considerable
amount
of
busing
would
there
not,
under
the
board's
plan
in
this
case,
right,
intra-zonal
busing,
would
there
not
be?
justice
potter
stewart
because
of
the
size
and
the
odd
shape
of
some
of
those
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
gerrymandered
zones
that
the
board
created?
justice
potter
stewart
there
would
be
necessarily.
justice
potter
stewart
but
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
not
for
the
purpose
of
creating
a
balance
or
ratio
of
race,
religion
or
national
origin,
you
don't
claim
that
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
except
the
proceedings
last
summer
of
last
july
and
august
haven't
been
through
the
court
of
appeals
yet.
justice
potter
stewart
but
then
he
found
some
more
facts
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
about
the
buses
that
haven't
--
and
those
that
hasn't
gone
to
the
court
of
appeal.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
nabrit
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
nabrit,
if
you
permit
me
to
say
so,
i
think
this
business
about
busing
and
whether
it
is
23
dollars
and
40
cents
throughout
the
state
of
north
carolina
and
$20.00
of
per
pupil
per
year
in
charlotte-mecklenburg,
the
county
buses
they
have
and
how
old
they
are
and
what
the
mileage
is,
it's
of
some
interest
but
so
far
as
i'm
concerned,
is
really
collateral
and
peripheral
to
the
basic
question
that
this
case
poses.
the
first
sentence
of
the
statute,
the
sentence
that
--
the
first
sentence
that
was
held
on
to
be
unconstitutional
doesn't
say
anything
about
busing.
it
just
says
no
student
shall
be
assigned
or
compelled
to
attend
any
school
on
account
of
race,
creed,
color,
or
national
origin
or
for
the
purpose
of
creating
a
balance
or
ratio
of
race,
religion,
or
national
origins.
now,
that
involves
a
fundamental
question
and
that
is
it
seems
to
me
the
fundamental
question
in
this
case.
and
that
question
exists
whether
or
not
the
children
walk
or
go
by
horseback
or
public
transportation
or
buses.
if
you
are
right
of
course,
buses
are
going
to
be
needed
if
it
--
where
and
if
the
distances
are
great
but
that's
a
rather
peripheral
to
the
basic
question,
isn't
it?
or
am
i
all
wrong
when
we
get
to
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
that
begins
with
the
proposition.
this
i
appreciate
is
at
least
a
tripartite
controversy
but
the
--
if
you
begin
with
the
proposition
that
it's
the
duty
of
the
school
board
to
maximize
compulsory
integration
to
the
extent
that
it
is
a;
feasible
or
b;
reasonable
or
c;
humanly
possible.
that's
one
thing
but
the
question
is
whether
that
is
the
constitutional
duty
of
a
school
board,
isn't
that
the
basic
question?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
it's
just
a
collateral
issues.
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
school
board's
plan,
vis-à-vis
that
that
would
be
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
nobody,
nobody
in
this
case
say
there
really
is
advocating
the
hew.
justice
potter
stewart
and
except
the
solicitor
general
on
a
very
unenthusiastic
way
as
i
understood
it.[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
now
the
parties
to
this
litigation
until
we
got
here,
no
court
and
none
of
the
parties
in
their
brief
had
very
much
good
to
say
for
the
hew
plan.
i'm
just
trying
to
put
that
on
you.
justice
potter
stewart
nor
does
that

plan
purport
to
be
a
neighborhood
plan
either.
