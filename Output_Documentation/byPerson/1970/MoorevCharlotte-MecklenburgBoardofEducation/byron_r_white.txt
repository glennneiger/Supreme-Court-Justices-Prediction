justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
really
say
that
as
a
matter
of
that
absolutely
a
school
board
never
sent
the
child
away
from
his
neighborhood
for
any
reason?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
that
they'd
be
a
lot
of
good
reasons
to
send
the
children
away
from
neighbor.
you
say
they
should
not
--
wherever
they
send
them,
they
shouldn't
do
so
on
account
of
race?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
that
gerrymandering,
racial
gerrymandering,
pairing
transportation
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
done
on
a
racial
basis
are
invalid.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
you
would
say
the
majority
to
minority
transfer
rule
is
equally
invalid.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
two
children
applied
for
a
transfer
under
the
majority
to
minority
transfer
rule
and
one
of
them
is
white
and
one
of
them
is
black
and
the
transfer
is
to
a
school
with
a
white
majority
and
a
black
minority.
the
two
children
transferring
will
not
both
be
transferred,
only
one
of
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
black
one
will
get
the
transfer,
the
white
one
won't?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
the
reverse
if
the
transfer
from
a
white
school
is
requested.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
it's
invalid?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
issues
a
directive
to
federal
judges.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
sections
in
the
2006
(a).
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
suggesting
then
that
green
was
improperly
decided
in
the
constitution?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course
if
they
--
the
board
has
a
choice
consistent
with
your
opposition
that
if
the
board
has
a
choice
of
locating
a
new
school
in
a
black
zone
or
white
zone
or
on
the
border,
and
chooses
the
border
because
of
racial
considerations,
would
you
think
that
was
stretching
brown
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
built
somewhere?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
would
--
that
would
be
on
other
--
for
other
reasons.
but
what
if
there
was
a
choice?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
decide,
“well,
we're
going
to
built
where
we'll
have
the
--
most
blacks
and
whites
going
to
school
together?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
needed
new
schools
somewhere
but
it
could
easily
be
a
half
mile
this
way
or
half
mile
that
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
suggest
that
a
school
board
as
part
of
its
educational
decision
making
could
say
we
choose
to
educate
--
if
we
have
a
choice
we
prefer
to
educate
whites
and
blacks
together
rather
than
separate.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
we
have
some
legitimate
decisions
to
make,
that
such
as
location
of
the
school,
drawing
of
zone
lines,
we
just
prefer
to
get
as
many
applicants
as
possible.
do
you
think
that
would
be
permissible
even
though
they
are
specifically
taking
race
into
account?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
perhaps
let's
say,
(inaudible)
in
drawing
the
zone
line
in
deciding
where
to
go
to
school?
justice
byron
r.
white
beginning
those
two
(voice
overlap)?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
heard
him
the
same
way
except
for
the
because
clause.
that's
not
the
reason
he
said
he
thought
it
violated
brown.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
of
the
compulsion
of
people
to
attend
certain
schools
or
be
a
--
based
on
their
race?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
this
is
directed
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
gather,
experiencing
the
last
couple
of
weeks
is
to
confirm
the
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
they've
got
the
buses,
they
barred
the
state
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
to
take
in
to
account
the
--
.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
also
on
the
next
year?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
solicitor
general
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
either
a
--
444,
498?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
this
statute
is
unconstitutional,
it's
only
because
the
constitution
requires
precisely
what
the
statute
prevents
in
the
circumstances
to
this
case.
you're
saying
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
requires
assignments
based
on
race
in
this
case.
it
requires
it
because
past
discrimination
that
as
a
matter
of
remedy,
you
would
say
that
the
constitution
absolutely
requires
it.
otherwise,
i
suppose
the
statute
would
be
constitutional.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
would
you
say
or
are
you
saying
--
justice
byron
r.
white
or
are
you
saying
that
the
united
states
court
or
any
judge
has
got
some
or
united
states
court
has
got
some
discretion
as
to
how
it
affects
the
remedy.
and
that
a
state
statute
which
purports
to
interfere
with
his
discretion
is
invalid?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
one
are
you
saying?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
the
constitution
requires
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can
say
brown
says
that
racial
discriminations
in
the
school
assignments
are
unconstitutional
and
we
should
have
a
remedy
to
the
situation
by
making
some
more
racial
assignment?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
well,
why
didn't
you
answer
yes?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
neighborhood
schools
at
the
outlining
districts
that
some
part
of
the
neighborhood?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
blakeney,
i
take
the
case
(inaudible)
no
discrimination
but
it
so
happens
that
there
are
some
white
schools
and
some
black
schools
in
the
city
by
whatever
circumstance
caused
it,
there
are
black
schools
and
white
schools
and
some
black
and
white
school.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
school
board
says
to
itself,
“we
think
we'll
have
a
better
educational
result
right
across
the
board,
people
will
come
out
better
citizens
if
they're
educated
together.
so
we
are
going
to
pair
some
schools.
we're
going
to
make
sure
that
all
through
--
all
the
grades
education
is
furnished
to
blacks
and
whites
together
rather
than
separately.
not
because
we're
required
to,
not
because
there's
any
--
we
have
to
give
a
remedy
for
anything.
we
just
think
as
an
educational
matter,
it's
going
to
--
versus
the
public
interest
to
do
it
this
way.”
so
they
go
to
your
black
child
and
say,
you
be
--
you
have
been
going
to
this
school,
but
you're
not
going
to
this
school
anymore.
you're
going
over
here
to
another
school
where
you
can
go
to
school
with
whites
and
they
have
said
to
the
white
people
the
same
thing.
i
take
it
you
wouldn't
say
that
as
prosperity?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
it
--
yes
or
no?
is
it
prescribed
or
not
under
--
and
since
it's
the
position
you
took
a
while
ago?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
the
school
board
says
that
we
concede
freely
that
the
reason
you
aren't
going
here
is
because
we
want
blacks
and
whites
to
go
to
school
together.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
--
this
is
a
racial
--
to
that
extent
it
is
a
racial
reason
for
the
change.
we
want
them
to
be
educated
together.
justice
byron
r.
white
nothing
whatsoever
in
the
geography
that
would
indicate
and
they
said,
this
used
to
be
the
first
sixth
grades
here
but
it
isn't
going
to
be
the
first
sixth
grades
anymore,
its
going
to
be
the
junior
high
school
and
you're
going
to
have
to
go
to
grade
school
over
here
with
all
the
rest
of
the
--
with
all
the
other
people
who
are
going
to
those
grades.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
school
board
says,
“we
are
--
we're
going
to
force
you
against
your
will
to
be
educated
with
members
of
the
opposite
race.”
that's
our
decision,
we're
going
to
force
you
to
do
that,
we
think
its
better
for
education,
would
--
you
would
say
that
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
only
--
the
school
board
had
really
concedes,
the
only
reason
we're
making
this
chain
is
to
make
sure
that
blacks
and
whites
go
to
school
together.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
that
that's
critically
your
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
you
are
wrong
on
that,
that
a
school
board
could
do
what
i
just
described?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
lets
assume
the
school
board
could
do
what
i
have
described,
consistently
with
brown
on
the
fourteenth
amendment.
could
--
does
that
make
any
difference
in
terms
of
your
argument
about
the
acceptability
of
this
order
of
the
district
court
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
really
say
that
as
a
matter
of
that
absolutely
a
school
board
never
sent
the
child
away
from
his
neighborhood
for
any
reason?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
that
they'd
be
a
lot
of
good
reasons
to
send
the
children
away
from
neighbor.
you
say
they
should
not
--
wherever
they
send
them,
they
shouldn't
do
so
on
account
of
race?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
that
gerrymandering,
racial
gerrymandering,
pairing
transportation
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
done
on
a
racial
basis
are
invalid.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
you
would
say
the
majority
to
minority
transfer
rule
is
equally
invalid.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
two
children
applied
for
a
transfer
under
the
majority
to

transfer
rule
and
one
of
them
is
white
and
one
of

and
the

is
to
a

with
a
white
majority
and
a
black
minority.
the
two
children
transferring
will
not
both
be
transferred,
only
one
of
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
black
one
will
get
the
transfer,
the
white
one
won't?
justice
byron

white
or
the
reverse
if
the
transfer
from
a
white
school
is
requested.
justice
byron

white
you
say
it's
invalid?

it
so
happens
that
there

you
wouldn't
say
that
as
prosperity?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
it
--
yes
or
no?
is
it
prescribed
or
not
under
--
and
since
it's
the
position
you
took
a
while
ago?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
the
school
board
says
that
we
concede
freely
that
the
reason
you
aren't
going
here
is
because
we
want
blacks
and
whites
to
go
to
school
together.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
--
this
is
a
racial
--
to
that
extent
it
is
a
racial
reason
for
the
change.
we
want
them
to
be
educated
together.
justice
byron
r.
white
nothing
whatsoever
in
the
geography
that
would
indicate
and
they
said,
this
used
to
be
the
first
sixth
grades
here
but
it
isn't
going
to
be
the
first
sixth
grades
anymore,
its
going
to
be
the
junior
high
school
and
you're
going
to
have
to
go
to
grade
school
over
here
with
all
the
rest
of
the
--
with
all
the
other
people
who
are
going
to
those
grades.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
school
board
says,
“we
are
--
we're
going
to
force
you
against
your
will
to
be
educated
with
members
of
the
opposite
race.”
that's
our
decision,
we're
going
to
force
you
to
do
that,
we
think
its
better
for
education,
would
--
you
would
say
that
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
only
--
the
school
board
had
really
concedes,
the
only
reason
we're
making
this
chain
is
to
make
sure
that
blacks
and
whites
go
to
school
together.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
that
that's
critically
your
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
you
are
wrong
on
that,
that
a
school
board
could
do
what
i
just
described?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
lets
assume
the
school
board
could
do
what
i
have
described,
consistently
with
brown
on
the
fourteenth
amendment.
could
--
does
that
make
any
difference
in
terms
of
your
argument
about
the
acceptability
of
this
order
of
the
district
court
in
this
case?
