mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
yes
your
honor.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
that
this
moore
case
will
furnish
to
the
court
more
truly
than
is
to
be
found
elsewhere
in
the
charlotte-mecklenburg
litigation.
clarity
and
certainty
and
indeed
the
solution
for
the
problem
with
which
the
court
is
now
wrestling.
these
qualities
emerged
if
the
court
please,
first
i
think
because
in
this
case
and
only
in
this
case
are
there
individuals
before
the
court,
pleading
their
constitutional
right
against
the
compulsions
which
have
been
imposed
below.
this
court
has
often
recognized
of
course
that
that
puts
a
constitutional
questions
in
its
clearest
bite.
furthermore,
if
the
court
please,
the
compulsions
which
have
been
imposed
are
all
opposed
by
these
moore
plaintiffs
for
whom
i
appear.
they
do
not
accept
some
and
reject
the
rest.
they
oppose
all
their
compulsions
of
racial
nature
which
have
been
fastened
upon
them
below.
by
contrast
as
your
honors
will
have
noted,
the
plaintiffs
and
swann
of
course
and
the
district
court
below
to
be
sure,
support
all
the
compulsions
which
have
been
imposed.
on
the
other
hand,
the
charlotte-mecklenburg
board
of
education,
defendant
in
this
case,
acquiesces
in
some
of
the
compulsions
indeed
propose
some
of
them,
the
solicitor
general
acquiesces
in
such
as
maybe
regarded
as
reasonable.
pardon
me,
the
solicitor
general
more
specifically
in
such
as
maybe
regarded
as
feasible.
and
the
circuit
court
below
in
such
as
may
regarded
as
reasonable.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
i
myself
am
not
able
to
draw
any
distinction
satisfactory
to
myself
your
honor.
in
any
event,
we
stand
against
all
the
racial
compulsions
and
that
is
our
posture
in
this
case.
and
from
beginning
to
end,
our
position
may
be
summarized
thus
briefly.
we
obtained
an
injunction
below
which
expresses
it.
this
injunction
said
to
the
charlotte-mecklenburg
board
of
education
and
who
--
any
agency
imposing
these
compulsions.
it
said,
“do
not
bar
any
child
from
any
school
in
charlotte-mecklenburg
because
of
its
race,
and
do
not
assign
children
in
charlotte
--
to
any
charlotte-mecklenburg
school
on
the
basis
of
race.
this
is
our
theme
as
i
say
at
all
stages.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
yes
sir.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
both
your
honor.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
and
the
minor
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
your
honor
that
is
of
course
a
central
subject
that
i
will
come
to,
but
i
will
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
i
will
answer
it
now
if
--
but
i
would
prefer
if
i
may
because
it
is
indeed
of
course
the
heart,
the
ultimate
heart
of
the
problem.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
there
is
no
power,
we
say
your
honor.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
no,
there
is
no
power
to
trample
their
constitutional
right
of
any
citizen
in
the
disestablishing
process.
and
the
constitutional
right
of
these
citizens,
these
plaintiffs
is
that
they
shall
not
be
barred
on
racial
grounds
and
they
shall
not
be
assigned
or
racial
grounds
and
that
is
what
is
being
done
to
them.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
yes.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
the
constitution
says
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
the
constitution
says
to
him,
the
constitution
is
expanded
in
brown.
we
say
that
the
constitution
seeing
his
situation
says
to
him,
“every
effort
is
going
to
be
exerted
and
all
zeal
and
all
absolute
good
faith
must
be
put
into
effect
to
see
to
it
that
you
are
given
freedom
that
you
shall
not
be
barred
anywhere
on
account
of
your
race
and
that
you
shall
not
be
assigned
anywhere
on
account
of
your
race.”
and
i
think
that
is
what
this
court
was
referring
to
in
the
cases
it
has
recently
decided.
this
court
was
expressing
its
sterning
patience
with
the
fact
that
freedom
was
not
truly
accorded
as
this
court
considered
in
many
of
these
cases
such
as
(inaudible)
carter
and
alexander
against
holmes.
and
we
go
100%
with
all
and
any
who
will
see
to
it
that
the
freedom
is
truly
there.
but,
once
that
freedom
is
truly
accorded,
that
freedom
from
governmental
action
based
on
race,
once
that
freedom
is
truly
accorded,
then
we
say
it
is
not
a
too
big
--
said
that
the
constitution
then
requires
that
the
freedom
of
any
person
be
taken
from
him
in
the
process
of
the
dismantling,
or
to
express
it
otherwise
your
honor
that
this
meddling
process
shall
not
itself
reconstruct
the
very
thing
that
is
being
dismantled
or
--
use
still
another
analogy,
the
constitution
so
brown
commanded
this,
the
constitution
says,
“you
shan't
have
travel
the
racial
road
in
the
matter
of
public
schools.”
now
your
honor,
our
basic
theme
is
you
can't
travel
that
same
racial
road
and
so
to
speak
remedying
the
constitutional
wrong
of
the
past.
you
do
not
remedy
past
constitutional
wrong
of
racial
nature
by
imposing
present,
constitutional
wrong
of
racial
nature.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
we
think
that
the
constitution
your
honor
cannot
be
said
to
require
that
any
action
be
taken
which
has
as
its
soul
objective
racial
assignment.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
it
prohibits
it.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
that's
what
brown
say.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
if
your
honor
in
the
operation
of
the
schools
on
a
natural
geographic
or
other,
non
other
--
non-racial
basis
such
action
came
naturally,
came
normally,
educationally,
very
well.
but
if
the
school
board's
action
and
purpose
was
to
accomplished
assignments
on
a
racial
--
on
racial
basis
which
otherwise
would
not
be
done,
but
it's
being
done,
the
child
is
pushed.
the
child
is
taken.
the
child
is
compelled
solely
because
of
his
color,
then
that
runs
a
file
of
the
constitution
right
there.
just
as
truly
as
what
existed
in
brown
and
we
plead
the
same
constitutional
right
here
that
the
plaintiffs
pled
in
brown.
now,
quickly
if
i
may
your
honor,
since
jurisdiction
in
this
case
was
deferred,
i
should
spend
a
moment
on
how
we
come
here,
i
think.
i'll
try
not
to
take
too
much
time
on
that
because
it
is
developed
in
our
brief,
a
jurisdictional
statement
and
also
a
typewritten
response
which
we
file
only
a
few
days
ago
in
answer
to
a
suggestion
filed
by
the
swann
plaintiffs,
only
a
few
days
ago.
we
beg
the
court's
attention
to
those
documents.
but
to
outline
briefly,
these
plaintiffs
upon
learning
in
february
of
this
year,
that
certain
compulsions
were
about
to
be
imposed
upon
them
went
into
the
state
court
of
north
carolina.
there
they
obtained
an
injunction.
an
injunction
which
we
say
is
in
the
terms
of
the
essential
meaning
of
brown
and
an
injunction
which
is
in
the
terms
of
a
north
carolina
statute
also.
and
those
terms
simply
were
what
i've
already
repeated.
do
not
assign
the
child
on
basis
of
his
race,
any
other
basis,
but
not
his
race.
do
not
exclude
him
from
a
school
because
of
his
race.
now,
that
injunction
was
--
our
case
was
removed
into
the
federal
court
at
that
point
upon
valid
federal
grounds
as
we
understand.
and
the
defendant
board
of
education
asked
for
a
three-judge
court
to
determine
the
constitutionality
of
the
pronouncement
of
the
statute
which
is
i
say
was
–
are
the
very
words
of
the
injunction
that
we
had.
before
the
three-judge
court
convened
and
heard
the
case,
the
district
court
below
set
aside
our
injunction.
the
single
judge
stated
aside,
saying
in
expressed
terms
that
he
did
so
pending
the
rulings
of
the
three-judge
court
and
of
this
court.
now,
the
three-judge
court
heard
the
case
and
ruled
that
the
words
i
have
already
expressed
your
honor
are
unconstitutional.
that
it
--
and
here
came
a
remarkable
inconsistency,
an
inconsistency
that
is
deep
and
inherent
and
afflicts
all
who
seek,
i
respectfully
say,
“rises
again
and
again
to
plague
all
who
seek
to
say,
“we
will
obey
brown,
which
commands
operating
school
on
a
non-racial
basis.
we
will
obey
brown
by
the
very
act
of
operating
them
on
a
racial
basis.”
here
is
the
inconsistency
that
the
court
itself
expressed.
it
says,
“it
is
constitutional,
quite
constitutional.
indeed,
it
is
the
essence
of
brown
that
you
shall
not
exclude
the
child
from
a
public
school
on
ground
of
his
race.”
but
it
is
unconstitutional
to
say
that
he
may
not
be
assigned
to
a
school
on
the
basis
of
his
race.
those
two
things,
your
honor,
are
absolutely
in
conflict.
they
are
inherently
so.
is
it
not
obvious
that
if
there
can
be
no
prohibition
against
assigning
the
child
on
basis
of
his
race
and
if
you
do,
therefore
assign
him
on
the
base
of
his
race,
you
are
excluding
him
on
basis
of
race
from
another
school,
this
school
to
which
he
wishes
to
go
or
which
he
may
have
been
attending
and
to
which
it
is
natural,
geographically
or
otherwise
that
he
should
attend.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
entirely.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
yes.
we
stand
their
fall
of
course
upon
the
constitution.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
parents
and
children
--
the
children
themselves
have
by
a
proper
process
been
made
parties.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
no
sir.
now,
we
present
this
question
your
honors
not
in
the
abstract,
we
show
the
factual
background
and
show
at
mecklenburg
where
these
children
live
and
go
to
school.
we
show
in
this
record
and
it
is
concise,
these
things
quickly,
that
as
far
back
as
1965,
this
school
system
was
adjudged
by
the
district
court,
the
same
district
court
albeit
a
judge,
was
adjudged
to
be
operating
on
a
non-racial
basis.
a
basis
in
which
there
was
no
gerrymandering
of
school
attendant's
zone.
geographically,
they
were
arranged
and
on
geographical
basis
children
were
assigned
to
attend
and
there
was
complete
freedom
of
transfer.
and
so
it
was
adjudged
non-racial
and
the
circuit
court
upheld
that.
and
then
--
now
just
within
the
past
year,
the
same
district
court,
albeit
now
the
new
judge
reaffirmed
many
of
those
factual
findings.
adjudged
for
example
that
in
no
other
public
school
system
had
the
board
of
education
achieved
as
much
in
the
way
of
racial
mixing
as
that
no
other
case
that
had
come
before
the
appellate
court
had
so
much
been
achieved
to
that
nature.
that
there
was
and
is
now
no
racial
purpose,
motive
or
element
in
the
spending
of
money,
in
the
providing
facilities,
faculties,
schools,
buildings,
books,
and
enumerated
numerous
others.
nevertheless,
your
honors,
upon
that
picture,
there
came
orders
of
unusual
severity.
these
orders
said,
“despite
the
factors
just
found,
it
is
also
true
that
in
some
schools
there
is
not
the
mixture
of
the
community.”
therefore,
this
court
will
order
that
the
mixture
of
the
community
shall
take
place
in
every
school.
and
the
court
went
on
to
say,
this
shall
be
maintained,
henceforth
and
note
these
words,
almost
revealing
in
its
paradox,
these
words
just
as
was
done
for
decades
before
brown
and
there
is
the
situation
your
honors,
non-racial
until
now
they
ordered
to
be
racial.
now
furthermore,
i
have
already
mentioned
that
these
plaintiffs
occupy
a
posture
different
from
any
other
parties
in
the
charlotte-mecklenburg
litigation
and
that
they
plead
their
own
constitutional
right
none
others
do.
they
also
raise
opposition
on
an
issue
which
the
chief
justice
concurring
in
north
cross
said
was
one
of
the
questions
that
needed
attention.
only
these
plaintiffs
raised
that
issue.
no
other
parties
do
and
that
issue
is
uncontested
before
this
court
except
and
unless
as
we
raise
it.
that
issue
is
this;
one
of
the
compulsions
here,
they
are
of
two
essential
natures,
all
the
compulsions
can
be
categorized
under
two
headings.
number
one,
the
gerrymandering
of
the
school
attendants
zones
which
the
school
board
itself
proposed
and
which
of
course,
all
the
parties
other
than
ourselves
are
now
accepting.
we
oppose
that
gerrymandering.
it
is
of
racial
nature.
the
circuit
court
says
it's
drastic
racial
gerrymandering
at
the
same
moment
that
it
upheld
it.
it
says,
“that's
what
it
is.”
and
now
all
other
compulsions
here
come
under
the
heading
of
requirement
that
the
child
go
long
distances
to
school
even
beyond
the
gerrymandered
boundaries.
and
of
course
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
i
beg
--
pardon
sir?
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
there
are
distances
of
as
much
as
15
to
16
miles.
now,
your
honors,
the
distances
however
of
course
are
not
our
point
nor
is
busing
our
point
as
such.
that's
a
colloquialism.
we
oppose
the
compulsion.
the
requirement
that
we
go
away
from
the
natural
geographic
school
and
near
the
child's
home
that
he
be
forced
to
go
away
from
that
whether
in
a
gerrymandered
new
zone
or
whether
crossing
the
boundaries
of
the
gerrymandered
zone
into
another
zone.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
no
i
do
not
say
that.
they
may
send
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
brown
forbids
doing
so
on
account
of
race.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
(inaudible)
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
invalid.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
indeed.
this
court
so
held
in
goss
against
the
board
of
education.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
no
sir.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
these
elements,
governmental
action,
compulsory
upon
the
child
and
shaped
and
based
on
no
grounds,
say
race.
it
is
solely
that
the
child
has
looked
at
--
his
color
is
observed,
that
determines
where
he
will
go
to
school.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
yes
sir
--
but
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
yes,
and
that
is
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
and
that
is
selectivity
on
the
basis
of
race.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
i
do
prohibited
by
the
constitution.
and
i
repeat
your
honor,
that
specific
subject
was
dealt
with
by
this
court
in
goss
against
board
of
education.
it
was
in
the
other
direction,
but
it
was
held
unconstitutional.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
no
sir.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
that
is
true
your
honor,
but
only
for
this
purpose
of
showing
that
when
it
comes
to
the
action
of
the
elected
representative
of
the
people,
this
is
not
a
constitutional
point,
but
it
is
significant
to
know,
no
elected
representatives
of
the
people
have
ever
enacted
any
legislation
in
the
direction
which
we
here
oppose
and
which
we
say
the
constitution
prohibits.
the
congress
in
the
civil
rights
act
specifically
twice
expressed
itself
to
this
effect.
let
it
not
be
thought.
this
is
the
meaning
of
it,
i
take
it.
let
it
not
be
thought
that
in
this
civil
rights
act,
we
mean
to
condone
or
to
provide
for
or
in
any
way
authorize
racial
balance,
racial
ratios,
compelling
anybody
to
go
anywhere
just
because
of
his
race.
this
act
does
not
mean
that.
that's
is
the
sense
in
which
we
cited
it
your
honor.
but
we
stand
of
all
on
the
constitution.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
no
sir.
i
think
that
statute
merely
meant
to
say
that
we,
the
congress
are
not
be
understood
as
we
enact
this
civil
rights
law,
we
are
not
to
be
understood
as
providing
for
any
kind
of
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
well
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
i
think
in
the
interpretation
and
administration
of
that
statute
is
meant.
but
your
honor,
whatever
maybe
the
true
interpretation
of
that
statute,
i
cannot
stand
upon
it
against
the
constitution.
my
adversaries
say
that
the
constitution
requires
the
racial
compulsion
which
they
espouse.
i
say
the
constitution
forbids
the
racial
compulsion
which
they
espouse.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
no
your
honor.
i
can
only
speak
to
green.
i
have
sought
to
find
the
exact
facts
of
green
as
merely
as
i
could.
the
factual
situation
in
green
is
far
different
from
here.
i
think
that
this
court
did
not
mean
to
say
anything
in
green
contrary
to
what
i
am
here
arguing
for.
in
green,
for
an
example,
each
child
was
assigned
to
the
district
that
he
formally
--
in
which
he
formally
attended.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
yes
sir.
and
i
think
--
and
furthermore,
right
of
transfer
was
accorded
only
after
that
suit
was
instituted
here.
it's
been
accorded
for
five
years
and
here
for
five
years,
it
has
been
judicially
found
nobody
has
been
excluded
from
any
school
on
account
of
his
race.
nobody
claims
that
anybody
has
by
governmental
action
and
compulsions.
now,
we
must
remember
i
think
your
honors,
it
must
constantly
be
borne
in
mind
that
we
here
are
applying
the
constitution
in
its
primal
elemental
provisions.
there's
no
legislation
here
in
which
it
might
be
considered
that
there
is
leeway
for
the
policy
maker.
excuse
me,
that
is
not
the
situation.
here,
it
is
purely
a
question
and
the
question
we
propound
and
we
contend
for
is
simply
this,
that
the
constitution
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
brown
declared
it
rules
the
case
and
rules
in
favor
of
the
pronouncement,
injunctive
pronouncement
and
statutory
pronouncement
that
we
had
below
and
which
has
been
taken
from
us.
now,
let
me
come
back
for
just
one
moment,
and
my
time
draws
to
close,
for
just
one
moment
to
this
basic
proposition.
the
constitution
comes
to
a
condition
of
separate
mess.
what
does
it
do?
i
say
that
the
constitution
as
declared
in
brown
says
with
regard
to
that
condition
of
separateness,
every
diligence
must
be
exerted,
every
effort
must
be
put
to
it
in
good
faith,
if
the
hand
of
government
is
to
be
found
in
that
separateness
causing
it,
producing
it,
directly
or
indirectly
by
subterfuge
or
subtly
or
in
any
manner,
it
must
be
sternly
removed.
and
that
i
say,
we
agree
with,
we
argue
for
100%.
but
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
yes
sir.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
they
moved
gradually
in
the
direction
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
the
zoning,
the
attendance
districting
was
made
geographic
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
and
--
in
about
1963
thereabouts.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
after
brown?
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
there
was
state
statute
in
effect
which
did
not
fully
take
the
hand
of
government
out
of
racial
compulsion.
but
it
did
commence
in
at
about
‘65.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
a
considerable
degree
of
it,
your
honor.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
i
cannot
say
the
exact
figures?
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
but
i
am
saying
this
your
honor
if
i
may,
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
the
test
is
not
how
much
racial
mixing
occurs.
the
test
is,
did
and
in
any
situation
today,
the
test
is
in
good
faith,
is
there
governmental
compulsion
forcing
children
to
be
racially
separate
in
the
schools
or
is
there
not.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
yes
sir.
i
recognize
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
i
recognize
that
there
is
a
constitutional
mandate
that
governmental
action
shall
not
bar
any
children
from
a
school
because
of
his
race
and
shall
not
assign
him
to
any
on
the
basis
of
race.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
affirmative
action
to
take
the
hand
of
government
out
of
any
racial
compelling.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
once
that
governmental
hand
is
removed
and
freedom
is
truly
accorded,
if
it
is,
then
the
constitution
is
of
aid.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
yes
sir.
the
government
cannot
go
further
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
the
government
cannot
go
further
and
take
the
children
by
this
“color”
and
say
to
them,
you
must
go
there
and
you
must
go
there
because
of
your
race.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
the
charlotte
authorities?
no
sir.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
no
sir.
did
not.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
we
removed
governmental
action
compelling
segregation.
and
when
that
is
done,
brown
is
obeyed.
and
when
the
government
goes
further,
it
reverses
brown.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
what
about
--
what?
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
the
true
meaning
green
is
consistent
with
brown.
green
has
not
reversed
brown.
this
court
would
not
have
taken
so
crucial
an
action
without
saying
so.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
green
is
more
recent.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
yes
sir.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
green
like
brown
says,
“you
must
accord
true
freedom”
and
that
we
say
has
been
done
here
and
i'll
end
with
this
if
i
may.
we
stand
upon
this,
the
individual,
constitutional
right
against
governmental
action
on
the
basis
of
race
and
any
individual
your
honors,
no
matter
how
little,
no
matter
how
alone,
he
can
stand
against
the
powers
of
all
government,
state
and
federal
and
stand
upon
that
proposition.
and
he
can
say
and
no
matter
when
by
whom
or
where,
racial
compulsion
was
formerly
imposed.
i
object
to
its
now
being
imposed
upon
me.
and
i
object
to
being
moved
anywhere
because
of
my
race.
and
that
is
a
rope
to
which
he
can
cling
and
it
will
save
him.
and
because
that
is
the
uniqueness
and
the
transcending
power
of
individual
liberty
under
a
constitution
and
our
faith
is
that
this
court
will
keep
it
so.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
counsel
on
our
end
of
the
table
have
agreed
that
i
may
speak
briefly
and
the
few
minutes
that
remained
in
the
time
that
we
were
to
divide
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
thank
you
sir.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
thank
you
sir.
i
don't
believe
i
will.
i
would
like
to
address
my
observations
at
this
time
if
i
may
your
honors
to
what
seems
to
me
to
have
emerged
as
the
main
focus
of
contention,
that
is
this
matter
of
remedy,
remedial
action
to
cure
or
correct
or
undo
or
dismantle
a
situation
caused
by,
let
us
assume
for
the
moment,
caused
by
wrongful
governmental
action
in
the
past
or
indeed
wrongful
governmental
action
presently
existing,
and
may
i
take
as
my
point
of
departure
the
question
that
the
chief
justice
asked
mr.
nabrit
earlier
to
this
effect,
whether
he
was
arguing
under
mr.
justice
black's
questioning
about
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute
on
its
terms,
the
chief
justice
put
the
question
to
mr.
nabrit,
are
you
contending
that
that
wording
is
unconstitutional
in
its
self
or
are
you
contending
that
it
won't
do.
it
is
invalid,
its
unconstitutional
in
its
application
to
this
factual
situation.
and
i
understood
mr.
nabrit
reply,
it's
the
letter.
now,
i
make
bold
to
take
the
position,
--
disposition
your
honors,
i
cannot
conceive
of
any
situation
no
matter
what
the
presence
of
governmental
action
in
the
past
or
in
the
present
may
be
in
which
any
remedy
can
be
utilized
to
redress
a
past
constitutional
wrong
by
imposing
a
new
constitutional
wrong
upon
anybody
who
objects.
now,
i
understand
upon
that
and
i
think
that
is
constitutional
gospel.
but
let
me
develop
that
just
a
little
more
if
i
may,
i
say
that
on
the
question
of
determining
whether
or
not
there
is
or
has
been
governmental
action
that
is
causing,
producing
a
situation
of
compelled
segregation,
that
is
the
true
issue
to
be
litigated
in
this
respect
if
it
can
be
found
and
this
is
essentially
what
are
argued
earlier.
if
it
can
be
found
through
a
careful
litigation
in
any
case,
that
freedom
is
not
being
truly
accorded
now
to
the
child,
then
whatever
it
takes
to
remove
that
governmental
action,
that
is
denying
that
child
that
true
freedom
today,
that
true
free-
by
a
true
freedom
i
mean,
freedom
to
go
to
school
on
non-racial
basis,
without
regard
to
his
color,
without
consideration
of
his
race.
if
that
freedom
is
not
being
truly
accorded
to
him,
then
that's
what
the
litigation
should
be
about
in
each
in
every
case
as
it
arises
and
they
will
of
course
arise
still
no
matter
what
the
decision
here
is.
but
that
should
be
the
inquiry
and
the
result
should
be
sternly
to
root
that
out
as
has
been
said
by
this
court,
root
and
branch,
extirpated,
that
freedom
genuinely
must
be
accorded
but
your
honors,
it
is
not
the
course
to
take
to
say
to
him,
we
will
now
put
you
back
on
the
road
of
racial
compulsion
rather
see
that
he
gets
freedom,
individual
freedom.
now,
let
me
give
an
illustration
to
indicate
further
what
i
am
speaking
of.
shall
it
be
said
to
a
negro
child
for
example
today
in
a
given
school,
the
negro
child,
let
us
say
is
attending
a
school
that
is
convenient
to
his
home
and
that's
--
he
prefers
to
go
there,
his
parents
prefer
him
to
go
there,
they
say
so,
they
say
so
in
the
moore
case,
this
is
where
he
wants
to
attend,
shall
school
authorities
be
allowed
to
go
to
that
child
and
say,
because
your
parents
were
by
law
or
governmental
action
forced
to
go
here,
now
therefore,
you
are
going
to
be
forced
to
leave
here
for
that
because
of
that
racial
compulsion
that
was
imposed
upon
them,
we
now
will
impose
a
racial
compulsion
upon
you
to
go
somewhere
else
that
though
you
do
not
wish
to
go
and
it
is
only
because
of
your
race
that
we
now
take
you
and
move
you.
or
to
the
white
child,
shall
governmental
authority
say
to
him
today,
because
your
parents
attended
this
school,
let
us
say
in
the
past,
in
the
neighborhood
of
your
home,
and
at
that
time,
negro
children
were
not
allowed
to
come
here.
by
law,
they
weren't,
therefore,
you,
the
white
child,
must
now
leave
here
and
go
to
another
school
you
do
not
wish
to
attend
and
we
send
you
away
from
here
because
you
are
white.
there
must
be
a
retribution
effective
here
for
what
was,
or
let
us
bring
it
to
the
present.
if
it
be
not
another
of
retribution
for
the
past
but
here
is
a
condition
of
separateness
existing
today,
we
must
correct
the
separateness.
therefore,
we
must
force
you
against
your
will
and
we
will
pick
you
by
your
color
and
sends
you.
now
this
--
it
must
be
starkly
called
what
it
is,
it
is
government
compelling
people,
driving
people
on
basis
of
race.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
yes.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
i
would
say
this
to
that,
your
honor,
that
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
i
think
that
the
protesting
child
is
entitled
to
an
inquiry
as
to
whether
or
not
the
hand
that
drew
the
boundaries
and
they
decided
where
that
school
should
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
and
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
your
honor,
if
there
is
anything
in
the
natural
geographic
situation
consistent
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
yes.
and
my
answer,
your
honor
is,
that
if
the
school
board
was
formally
utilizing
or
at
anytime
utilizing
natural
geography
and
then
left
it,
departed
from
it
for
no
reason
other
than
to
force
people
against
their
will,
on
basis
of
race
then
the
objector
can
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
i
would
say
your
honor
that
the
sole
test
is
what
brown
laid
down
namely,
look
to
inquire,
look
to
see,
is
the
action
of
government
here,
is
it
bottom
the
point,
shaped
according
to
race
and
race
alone,
race
alone
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
--
then
it
cannot
be.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
race
alone
--
then
brown
does
not
permit
it,
your
honor.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
in
this
case?
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
we
of
course
rest
upon
the
exact
facts
of
this
case
but
the
proposition
generally
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
then
in
this
case
they
have
not
done
so
your
honor.
here,
it
is
not
the
situation
you've
just
described.
here
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
i
would
say
your
honor
where
the
facts
are
as
here
admitted,
namely,
we
drew
these
lines
for
no
reason
except
to
include
blacks
or
exclude
whites
or
vice
versa,
we
draw
them
for
no
reason
than
except
that,
it
was
not
educational
purpose
that
motivated
us
or
move
does
here.
it
was
not
that,
this
is
conceded
here
in
this
moore
record,
these
lines
were
drawn,
these
moves
were
made,
these
people
who
are
being
sent
here
and
there
not
for
educational
reasons
but
for
racial
reasons.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
the
statute
in
question?
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
yes.
in
the
spring
of
'69,
early
‘69.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
we
might
indeed
still
have
the
same
problem,
your
honor.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
no
sir,
the
district
court
orders
were
entered
a
year
after
this
statute
was
passed.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
this
statute
was
passed
to
express
the
policy
of
the
state
as
being
the
same
as
the
decision
of
this
court
in
brown.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
the
district
court
in
‘65
said
that
charlotte-mecklenburg
was
a
non-racial
system.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
and
being
operated
non-racially.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
and
the
circuit
court
upheld
it.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
the
statute
was
in
69,
yes
sir.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
all
i
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
well,
whatever
context
it
be
--
context
would
be
considered
in,
your
honor.
the
point
is
this,
this
statute
said,
“the
state
of
north
carolina
adopts
as
its
policy,
this
principle
specifically
from
here
on
namely,
children
shall
not
be
barred
from
a
school
on
account
of
race
and
they
shall
not
be
assigned
to
a
school
on
account
of
race.
that's
all
it
said
and
that's
all
we
ask
enforcement
of
and
that's
all
that
our
injunction
said
and
the
only
reason
we
entitled
the
enforcement
of
our
injunction
is
because
judge
mcmillan
has
ruled
the
opposite.
he
has
said,
contrary
to
brown,
he
has
said,
“children,
you
must
go
because
of
your
race
now
into
the
schools
where
i
send
you.”
that
is
what
we
complain
of
your
honor.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
yes
your
honor.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
that
this
moore
case
will
furnish
to
the
court
more
truly
than
is
to
be
found
elsewhere
in
the
charlotte-mecklenburg
litigation.
clarity
and
certainty
and
indeed
the
solution
for
the
problem
with
which
the
court
is
now
wrestling.
these
qualities
emerged
if
the
court
please,
first
i
think
because
in
this
case
and
only
in
this
case
are
there
individuals
before
the
court,
pleading
their
constitutional
right
against
the
compulsions
which
have
been
imposed
below.
this
court
has
often
recognized
of
course
that
that
puts
a
constitutional
questions
in
its
clearest
bite.
furthermore,
if
the
court
please,
the
compulsions
which
have
been
imposed
are
all
opposed
by
these
moore
plaintiffs
for
whom
i
appear.
they
do
not
accept
some
and
reject
the
rest.
they
oppose
all
their
compulsions
of
racial
nature
which
have
been
fastened
upon
them
below.
by
contrast
as
your
honors
will
have
noted,
the
plaintiffs
and
swann
of
course
and
the
district
court
below
to
be
sure,
support
all
the
compulsions
which
have
been
imposed.
on
the
other
hand,
the
charlotte-mecklenburg
board
of
education,
defendant
in
this
case,
acquiesces
in
some
of
the
compulsions
indeed
propose
some
of
them,
the
solicitor
general
acquiesces
in
such
as
maybe
regarded
as
reasonable.
pardon
me,
the
solicitor
general
more
specifically
in
such
as
maybe
regarded
as
feasible.
and
the
circuit
court
below
in
such
as
may
regarded
as
reasonable.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
i
myself
am
not
able
to
draw
any
distinction
satisfactory
to
myself
your
honor.
in
any
event,
we
stand
against
all
the
racial
compulsions
and
that
is
our
posture
in
this
case.
and
from
beginning
to
end,
our
position
may
be
summarized
thus
briefly.
we
obtained
an
injunction
below
which
expresses
it.
this
injunction
said
to
the
charlotte-mecklenburg
board
of
education
and
who
--
any
agency
imposing
these
compulsions.
it
said,
“do
not
bar
any
child
from
any
school
in
charlotte-mecklenburg
because
of
its
race,
and
do
not
assign
children
in
charlotte
--
to
any
charlotte-mecklenburg
school
on
the
basis
of
race.
this
is
our
theme
as
i
say
at
all
stages.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
yes
sir.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
both
your
honor.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
and
the
minor
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
your
honor
that
is
of
course
a
central
subject
that
i
will
come
to,
but
i
will
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
i
will
answer
it
now
if
--
but
i
would
prefer
if
i
may
because
it
is
indeed
of
course
the
heart,
the
ultimate
heart
of
the
problem.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
there
is
no
power,
we
say
your
honor.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
no,
there
is
no
power
to
trample
their
constitutional
right
of
any
citizen
in
the
disestablishing
process.
and
the
constitutional
right
of
these
citizens,
these
plaintiffs
is
that
they
shall
not
be
barred
on
racial
grounds
and
they
shall
not
be
assigned
or
racial
grounds
and
that
is
what
is
being
done
to
them.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
yes.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
the
constitution
says
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
the
constitution
says
to
him,
the
constitution
is
expanded
in
brown.
we
say
that
the
constitution
seeing
his
situation
says
to
him,
“every
effort
is
going
to
be
exerted
and
all
zeal
and
all
absolute
good
faith
must
be
put
into
effect
to
see
to
it
that
you
are
given
freedom
that
you
shall
not
be
barred
anywhere
on
account
of
your
race
and
that
you
shall
not
be
assigned
anywhere
on
account
of
your
race.”
and
i
think
that
is
what
this
court
was
referring
to
in
the
cases
it
has
recently
decided.
this
court
was
expressing
its
sterning
patience
with
the
fact
that
freedom
was
not
truly
accorded
as
this
court
considered
in
many
of
these
cases
such
as
(inaudible)
carter
and
alexander
against
holmes.
and
we
go
100%
with
all
and
any
who
will
see
to
it
that
the
freedom
is
truly
there.
but,
once
that
freedom
is
truly
accorded,
that
freedom
from
governmental
action
based
on
race,
once
that
freedom
is
truly
accorded,
then
we
say
it
is
not
a
too
big
--
said
that
the
constitution
then
requires
that
the
freedom
of
any
person
be
taken
from
him
in
the
process
of
the
dismantling,
or
to
express
it
otherwise
your
honor
that
this
meddling
process
shall
not
itself
reconstruct
the
very
thing
that
is
being
dismantled
or
--
use
still
another
analogy,
the
constitution
so
brown
commanded
this,
the
constitution
says,
“you
shan't
have
travel
the
racial
road
in
the
matter
of
public
schools.”
now
your
honor,
our
basic
theme
is
you
can't
travel
that
same
racial
road
and
so
to
speak
remedying
the
constitutional
wrong
of
the
past.
you
do
not
remedy
past
constitutional
wrong
of
racial
nature
by
imposing
present,
constitutional
wrong
of
racial
nature.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
we
think
that
the
constitution
your
honor
cannot
be
said
to
require
that
any
action
be
taken
which
has
as
its
soul
objective
racial
assignment.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
it
prohibits
it.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
that's
what
brown
say.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
if
your
honor
in
the
operation
of
the
schools
on
a
natural
geographic
or
other,
non
other
--
non-racial
basis
such
action
came
naturally,
came
normally,
educationally,
very
well.
but
if
the
school
board's
action
and
purpose
was
to
accomplished
assignments
on
a
racial
--
on
racial
basis
which
otherwise
would
not
be
done,
but
it's
being
done,
the
child
is
pushed.
the
child
is
taken.
the
child
is
compelled
solely
because
of
his
color,
then
that
runs
a
file
of
the
constitution
right
there.
just
as
truly
as
what
existed
in
brown
and
we
plead
the
same
constitutional
right
here
that
the
plaintiffs
pled
in
brown.
now,
quickly
if
i
may
your
honor,
since
jurisdiction
in
this
case
was
deferred,
i
should
spend
a
moment
on
how
we
come
here,
i
think.
i'll
try
not
to
take
too
much
time
on
that
because
it
is
developed
in
our
brief,
a
jurisdictional
statement
and
also
a
typewritten
response
which
we
file
only
a
few
days
ago
in
answer
to
a
suggestion
filed
by
the
swann
plaintiffs,
only
a
few
days
ago.
we
beg
the
court's
attention
to
those
documents.
but
to
outline
briefly,
these
plaintiffs
upon
learning
in
february
of
this
year,
that
certain
compulsions
were
about
to
be
imposed
upon
them
went
into
the
state
court
of
north
carolina.
there
they
obtained
an
injunction.
an
injunction
which
we
say
is
in
the
terms
of
the
essential
meaning
of
brown
and
an
injunction
which
is
in
the
terms
of
a
north
carolina
statute
also.
and
those
terms
simply
were
what
i've
already
repeated.
do
not
assign
the
child
on
basis
of
his
race,
any
other
basis,
but
not
his
race.
do
not
exclude
him
from
a
school
because
of
his
race.
now,
that
injunction
was
--
our
case
was
removed
into
the
federal
court
at
that
point
upon
valid
federal
grounds
as
we
understand.
and
the
defendant
board
of
education
asked
for
a
three-judge
court
to
determine
the
constitutionality
of
the
pronouncement
of
the
statute
which
is
i
say
was
–
are
the
very
words
of
the
injunction
that
we
had.
before
the
three-judge
court
convened
and
heard
the
case,
the
district
court
below
set
aside
our
injunction.
the
single
judge
stated
aside,
saying
in
expressed
terms
that
he
did
so
pending
the
rulings
of
the
three-judge
court
and
of
this
court.
now,
the
three-judge
court
heard
the
case
and
ruled
that
the
words
i
have
already
expressed
your
honor
are
unconstitutional.
that
it
--
and
here
came
a
remarkable
inconsistency,
an
inconsistency
that
is
deep
and
inherent
and
afflicts
all
who
seek,
i
respectfully
say,
“rises
again
and
again
to
plague
all
who
seek
to
say,
“we
will
obey
brown,
which
commands
operating
school
on
a
non-racial
basis.
we
will
obey
brown
by
the
very
act
of
operating
them
on
a
racial
basis.”
here
is
the
inconsistency
that
the
court
itself
expressed.
it
says,
“it
is
constitutional,
quite
constitutional.
indeed,
it
is
the
essence
of
brown
that
you
shall
not
exclude
the
child
from
a
public
school
on
ground
of
his
race.”
but
it
is
unconstitutional
to
say
that
he
may
not
be
assigned
to
a
school
on
the
basis
of
his
race.
those
two
things,
your
honor,
are
absolutely
in
conflict.
they
are
inherently
so.
is
it
not
obvious
that
if
there
can
be
no
prohibition
against
assigning
the
child
on
basis
of
his
race
and
if
you
do,
therefore
assign
him
on
the
base
of
his
race,
you
are
excluding
him
on
basis
of
race
from
another
school,
this
school
to
which
he
wishes
to
go
or
which
he
may
have
been
attending
and
to
which
it
is
natural,
geographically
or
otherwise
that
he
should
attend.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
entirely.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
yes.
we
stand
their
fall
of
course
upon
the
constitution.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
parents
and
children
--
the
children
themselves
have
by
a
proper
process
been
made
parties.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
no
sir.
now,
we
present
this
question
your
honors
not
in
the
abstract,
we
show
the
factual
background
and
show
at
mecklenburg
where
these
children
live
and
go
to
school.
we
show
in
this
record
and
it
is
concise,
these
things
quickly,
that
as
far
back
as
1965,
this
school
system
was
adjudged
by
the
district
court,
the
same
district
court
albeit
a
judge,
was
adjudged
to
be
operating
on
a
non-racial
basis.
a
basis
in
which
there
was
no
gerrymandering
of
school
attendant's
zone.
geographically,
they
were
arranged
and
on
geographical
basis
children
were
assigned
to
attend
and
there
was
complete
freedom
of
transfer.
and
so
it
was
adjudged
non-racial
and
the
circuit
court
upheld
that.
and
then
--
now
just
within
the
past
year,
the
same
district
court,
albeit
now
the
new
judge
reaffirmed
many
of
those
factual
findings.
adjudged
for
example
that
in
no
other
public
school
system
had
the
board
of
education
achieved
as
much
in
the
way
of
racial
mixing
as
that
no
other
case
that
had
come
before
the
appellate
court
had
so
much
been
achieved
to
that
nature.
that
there
was
and
is
now
no
racial
purpose,
motive
or
element
in
the
spending
of
money,
in
the
providing
facilities,
faculties,
schools,
buildings,
books,
and
enumerated
numerous
others.
nevertheless,
your
honors,
upon
that
picture,
there
came
orders
of
unusual
severity.
these
orders
said,
“despite
the
factors
just
found,
it
is
also
true
that
in
some
schools
there
is
not
the
mixture
of
the
community.”
therefore,
this
court
will
order
that
the
mixture
of
the
community
shall
take
place
in
every
school.
and
the
court
went
on
to
say,
this
shall
be
maintained,
henceforth
and
note
these
words,
almost
revealing
in
its
paradox,
these
words
just
as
was
done
for
decades
before
brown
and
there
is
the
situation
your
honors,
non-racial
until
now
they
ordered
to
be
racial.
now
furthermore,
i
have
already
mentioned
that
these
plaintiffs
occupy
a
posture
different
from
any
other
parties
in
the
charlotte-mecklenburg
litigation
and
that
they
plead
their
own
constitutional
right
none
others
do.
they
also
raise
opposition
on
an
issue
which
the
chief
justice
concurring
in
north
cross
said
was
one
of
the
questions
that
needed
attention.
only
these
plaintiffs
raised
that
issue.
no
other
parties
do
and
that
issue
is
uncontested
before
this
court
except
and
unless
as
we
raise
it.
that
issue
is
this;
one
of
the
compulsions
here,
they
are
of
two
essential
natures,
all
the
compulsions
can
be
categorized
under
two
headings.
number
one,
the
gerrymandering
of
the
school
attendants
zones
which
the
school
board
itself
proposed
and
which
of
course,
all
the
parties
other
than
ourselves
are
now
accepting.
we
oppose
that
gerrymandering.
it
is
of
racial
nature.
the
circuit
court
says
it's
drastic
racial
gerrymandering
at
the
same
moment
that
it
upheld
it.
it
says,
“that's
what
it
is.”
and
now
all
other
compulsions
here
come
under
the
heading
of
requirement
that
the
child
go
long
distances
to
school
even
beyond
the
gerrymandered
boundaries.
and
of
course
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
i
beg
--
pardon
sir?
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
there
are
distances
of
as
much
as
15
to
16
miles.
now,
your
honors,
the
distances
however
of
course
are
not
our
point
nor
is
busing
our
point
as
such.
that's
a
colloquialism.
we
oppose
the
compulsion.
the
requirement
that
we
go
away
from
the
natural
geographic
school
and
near
the
child's
home
that
he
be
forced
to
go
away
from
that
whether
in
a
gerrymandered
new
zone
or
whether
crossing
the
boundaries
of
the
gerrymandered
zone
into
another
zone.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
no
i
do
not
say
that.
they
may
send
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
brown
forbids
doing
so
on
account
of
race.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
(inaudible)
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
invalid.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
indeed.
this
court
so
held
in
goss
against
the
board
of
education.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
no
sir.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
these
elements,
governmental
action,
compulsory
upon
the
child
and
shaped
and
based
on
no
grounds,
say
race.
it
is
solely
that
the
child
has
looked
at
--
his
color
is
observed,
that
determines
where
he
will
go
to
school.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
yes
sir
--
but
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
yes,
and
that
is
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
and
that
is
selectivity
on
the
basis
of
race.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
i
do
prohibited
by
the
constitution.
and
i
repeat
your
honor,
that
specific
subject
was
dealt
with
by
this
court
in
goss
against
board
of
education.
it
was
in
the
other
direction,
but
it
was
held
unconstitutional.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
no
sir.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
that
is
true
your
honor,
but
only
for
this
purpose
of
showing
that
when
it
comes
to
the
action
of
the
elected
representative
of
the
people,
this
is
not
a
constitutional
point,
but
it
is
significant
to
know,
no
elected
representatives
of
the
people
have
ever
enacted
any
legislation
in
the
direction
which
we
here
oppose
and
which
we
say
the
constitution
prohibits.
the
congress
in
the
civil
rights
act
specifically
twice
expressed
itself
to
this
effect.
let
it
not
be
thought.
this
is
the
meaning
of
it,
i
take
it.
let
it
not
be
thought
that
in
this
civil
rights
act,
we
mean
to
condone
or
to
provide
for
or
in
any
way
authorize
racial
balance,
racial
ratios,
compelling
anybody
to
go
anywhere
just
because
of
his
race.
this
act
does
not
mean
that.
that's
is
the
sense
in
which
we
cited
it
your
honor.
but
we
stand
of
all
on
the
constitution.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
no
sir.
i
think
that
statute
merely
meant
to
say
that
we,
the
congress
are
not
be
understood
as
we
enact
this
civil
rights
law,
we
are
not
to
be
understood
as
providing
for
any
kind
of
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
well
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
i
think
in
the
interpretation
and
administration
of
that
statute
is
meant.
but
your
honor,
whatever
maybe
the
true
interpretation
of
that
statute,
i
cannot
stand
upon
it
against
the
constitution.
my
adversaries
say
that
the
constitution
requires
the
racial
compulsion
which
they
espouse.
i
say
the
constitution
forbids
the
racial
compulsion
which
they
espouse.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
no
your
honor.
i
can
only
speak
to
green.
i
have
sought
to
find
the
exact
facts
of
green
as
merely
as
i
could.
the
factual
situation
in
green
is
far
different
from
here.
i
think
that
this
court
did
not
mean
to
say
anything
in
green
contrary
to
what
i
am
here
arguing
for.
in
green,
for
an
example,
each
child
was
assigned
to
the
district
that
he
formally
--
in
which
he
formally
attended.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
yes
sir.
and
i
think
--
and
furthermore,
right
of
transfer
was
accorded
only
after
that
suit
was
instituted
here.
it's
been
accorded
for
five
years
and
here
for
five
years,
it
has
been
judicially
found
nobody
has
been
excluded
from
any
school
on
account
of
his
race.
nobody
claims
that
anybody
has
by
governmental
action
and
compulsions.
now,
we
must
remember
i
think
your
honors,
it
must
constantly
be
borne
in
mind
that
we
here
are
applying
the
constitution
in
its
primal
elemental
provisions.
there's
no
legislation
here
in
which
it
might
be
considered
that
there
is
leeway
for
the
policy
maker.
excuse
me,
that
is
not
the
situation.
here,
it
is
purely
a
question
and
the
question
we
propound
and
we
contend
for
is
simply
this,
that
the
constitution
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
brown
declared
it
rules
the
case
and
rules
in
favor
of
the
pronouncement,
injunctive
pronouncement
and
statutory
pronouncement
that
we
had
below
and
which
has
been
taken
from
us.
now,
let
me
come
back
for
just
one
moment,
and
my
time
draws
to
close,
for
just
one
moment
to
this
basic
proposition.
the
constitution
comes
to
a
condition
of
separate
mess.
what
does
it
do?
i
say
that
the
constitution
as
declared
in
brown
says
with
regard
to
that
condition
of
separateness,
every
diligence
must
be
exerted,
every
effort
must
be
put
to
it
in
good
faith,
if
the
hand
of
government
is
to
be
found
in
that
separateness
causing
it,
producing
it,
directly
or
indirectly
by
subterfuge
or
subtly
or
in
any
manner,
it
must
be
sternly
removed.
and
that
i
say,
we
agree
with,
we
argue
for
100%.
but
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
yes
sir.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
they
moved
gradually
in
the
direction
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
the
zoning,
the
attendance
districting
was
made
geographic
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
and
--
in
about
1963
thereabouts.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
after
brown?
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
there
was
state
statute
in
effect
which
did
not
fully
take
the
hand
of
government
out
of
racial
compulsion.
but
it
did
commence
in
at
about
‘65.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
a
considerable
degree
of
it,
your
honor.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
i
cannot
say
the
exact
figures?
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
but
i
am
saying
this
your
honor
if
i
may,
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
the
test
is
not
how
much
racial
mixing
occurs.
the
test
is,
did
and
in
any
situation
today,
the
test
is
in
good
faith,
is
there
governmental
compulsion
forcing
children
to
be
racially
separate
in
the
schools
or
is
there
not.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
yes
sir.
i
recognize
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
i
recognize
that
there
is
a
constitutional
mandate
that
governmental
action
shall
not
bar
any
children
from
a
school
because
of
his
race
and
shall
not
assign
him
to
any
on
the
basis
of
race.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
affirmative
action
to
take
the
hand
of
government
out
of
any
racial
compelling.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
once
that
governmental
hand
is
removed
and
freedom
is
truly
accorded,
if
it
is,
then
the
constitution
is
of
aid.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
yes
sir.
the
government
cannot
go
further
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
the
government
cannot
go
further
and
take
the
children
by
this
“color”
and
say
to
them,
you
must
go
there
and
you
must
go
there
because
of
your
race.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
the
charlotte
authorities?
no
sir.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
no
sir.
did
not.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
we
removed
governmental
action
compelling
segregation.
and
when
that
is
done,
brown
is
obeyed.
and
when
the
government
goes
further,
it
reverses
brown.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
what
about
--
what?
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
the
true
meaning
green
is
consistent
with
brown.
green
has
not
reversed
brown.
this
court
would
not
have
taken
so
crucial
an
action
without
saying
so.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
green
is
more
recent.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
yes
sir.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
green
like
brown
says,
“you
must
accord
true
freedom”
and
that
we
say
has
been
done
here
and
i'll
end
with
this
if
i
may.
we
stand
upon
this,
the
individual,
constitutional
right
against
governmental
action
on
the
basis
of
race
and
any
individual
your
honors,
no
matter
how
little,
no
matter
how
alone,
he
can
stand
against
the
powers
of
all
government,
state
and
federal
and
stand
upon
that
proposition.
and
he
can
say
and
no
matter
when
by
whom
or
where,
racial
compulsion
was
formerly
imposed.
i
object
to
its
now
being
imposed
upon
me.
and
i
object
to
being
moved
anywhere
because
of
my
race.
and
that
is
a
rope
to
which
he
can
cling
and
it
will
save
him.
and
because
that
is
the
uniqueness
and
the
transcending
power
of
individual
liberty
under
a
constitution
and
our
faith
is
that
this
court
will
keep
it
so.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
counsel
on
our
end
of
the
table
have
agreed
that
i
may
speak
briefly
and
the
few
minutes
that
remained
in
the
time
that
we
were
to
divide
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
thank
you
sir.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
thank
you
sir.
i
don't
believe
i
will.
i
would
like
to
address
my
observations
at
this
time
if
i
may
your
honors
to
what
seems
to
me
to
have
emerged
as
the
main
focus
of
contention,
that
is
this
matter
of
remedy,
remedial
action
to
cure
or
correct
or
undo
or
dismantle
a
situation
caused
by,
let
us
assume
for
the
moment,
caused
by
wrongful
governmental
action
in
the
past
or
indeed
wrongful
governmental
action
presently
existing,
and
may
i
take
as
my
point
of
departure
the
question
that
the
chief
justice
asked
mr.
nabrit
earlier
to
this
effect,
whether
he
was
arguing
under
mr.
justice
black's
questioning
about
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute
on
its
terms,
the
chief
justice
put
the
question
to
mr.
nabrit,
are
you
contending
that
that
wording
is
unconstitutional
in
its
self
or
are
you
contending
that
it
won't
do.
it
is
invalid,
its
unconstitutional
in
its
application
to
this
factual
situation.
and
i
understood
mr.
nabrit
reply,
it's
the
letter.
now,
i
make
bold
to
take
the
position,
--
disposition
your
honors,
i
cannot
conceive
of
any
situation
no
matter
what
the
presence
of
governmental
action
in
the
past
or
in
the
present
may
be
in
which
any
remedy
can
be
utilized
to
redress
a
past
constitutional
wrong
by
imposing
a
new
constitutional
wrong
upon
anybody
who
objects.
now,
i
understand
upon
that
and
i
think
that
is
constitutional
gospel.
but
let
me
develop
that
just
a
little
more
if
i
may,
i
say
that
on
the
question
of
determining
whether
or
not
there
is
or
has
been
governmental
action
that
is
causing,
producing
a
situation
of
compelled
segregation,
that
is
the
true
issue
to
be
litigated
in
this
respect
if
it
can
be
found
and
this
is
essentially
what
are
argued
earlier.
if
it
can
be
found
through
a
careful
litigation
in
any
case,
that
freedom
is
not
being
truly
accorded
now
to
the
child,
then
whatever
it
takes
to
remove
that
governmental
action,
that
is
denying
that
child
that
true
freedom
today,
that
true
free-
by
a
true
freedom
i
mean,
freedom
to
go
to
school
on
non-racial
basis,
without
regard
to
his
color,
without
consideration
of
his
race.
if
that
freedom
is
not
being
truly
accorded
to
him,
then
that's
what
the
litigation
should
be
about
in
each
in
every
case
as
it
arises
and
they
will
of
course
arise
still
no
matter
what
the
decision
here
is.
but
that
should
be
the
inquiry
and
the
result
should
be
sternly
to
root
that
out
as
has
been
said
by
this
court,
root
and
branch,
extirpated,
that
freedom
genuinely
must
be
accorded
but
your
honors,
it
is
not
the
course
to
take
to
say
to
him,
we
will
now
put
you
back
on
the
road
of
racial
compulsion
rather
see
that
he
gets
freedom,
individual
freedom.
now,
let
me
give
an
illustration
to
indicate
further
what
i
am
speaking
of.
shall
it
be
said
to
a
negro
child
for
example
today
in
a
given
school,
the
negro
child,
let
us
say
is
attending
a
school
that
is
convenient
to
his
home
and
that's
--
he
prefers
to
go
there,
his
parents
prefer
him
to
go
there,
they
say
so,
they
say
so
in
the
moore
case,
this
is
where
he
wants
to
attend,
shall
school
authorities
be
allowed
to
go
to
that
child
and
say,
because
your
parents
were
by
law
or
governmental
action
forced
to
go
here,
now
therefore,
you
are
going
to
be
forced
to
leave
here
for
that
because
of
that
racial
compulsion
that
was
imposed
upon
them,
we
now
will
impose
a
racial
compulsion
upon
you
to
go
somewhere
else
that
though
you
do
not
wish
to
go
and
it
is
only
because
of
your
race
that
we
now
take
you
and
move
you.
or
to
the
white
child,
shall
governmental
authority
say
to
him
today,
because
your
parents
attended
this
school,
let
us
say
in
the
past,
in
the
neighborhood
of
your
home,
and
at
that
time,
negro
children
were
not
allowed
to
come
here.
by
law,
they
weren't,
therefore,
you,
the
white
child,
must
now
leave
here
and
go
to
another
school
you
do
not
wish
to
attend
and
we
send
you
away
from
here
because
you
are
white.
there
must
be
a
retribution
effective
here
for
what
was,
or
let
us
bring
it
to
the
present.
if
it
be
not
another
of
retribution
for
the
past
but
here
is
a
condition
of
separateness
existing
today,
we
must
correct
the
separateness.
therefore,
we
must
force
you
against
your
will
and
we
will
pick
you
by
your
color
and
sends
you.
now
this
--
it
must
be
starkly
called
what
it
is,
it
is
government
compelling
people,
driving
people
on
basis
of
race.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
yes.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
i
would
say
this
to
that,
your
honor,
that
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
i
think
that
the
protesting
child
is
entitled
to
an
inquiry
as
to
whether
or
not
the
hand
that
drew
the
boundaries
and
they
decided
where
that
school
should
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
and
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
your
honor,
if
there
is
anything
in
the
natural
geographic
situation
consistent
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
yes.
and
my
answer,
your
honor
is,
that
if
the
school
board
was
formally
utilizing
or
at
anytime
utilizing
natural
geography
and
then
left
it,
departed
from
it
for
no
reason
other
than
to
force
people
against
their
will,
on
basis
of
race
then
the
objector
can
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
i
would
say
your
honor
that
the
sole
test
is
what
brown
laid
down
namely,
look
to
inquire,
look
to
see,
is
the
action
of
government
here,
is
it
bottom
the
point,
shaped
according
to
race
and
race
alone,
race
alone
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
--
then
it
cannot
be.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
race
alone
--
then
brown
does
not
permit
it,
your
honor.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
in
this
case?
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
we
of
course
rest
upon
the
exact
facts
of
this
case
but
the
proposition
generally
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
then
in
this
case
they
have
not
done
so
your
honor.
here,
it
is
not
the
situation
you've
just
described.
here
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
i
would
say
your
honor
where
the
facts
are
as
here
admitted,
namely,
we
drew
these
lines
for
no
reason
except
to
include
blacks
or
exclude
whites
or
vice
versa,
we
draw
them
for
no
reason
than
except
that,
it
was
not
educational
purpose
that
motivated
us
or
move
does
here.
it
was
not
that,
this
is
conceded
here
in
this
moore
record,
these
lines
were
drawn,
these
moves
were
made,
these
people
who
are
being
sent
here
and
there
not
for
educational
reasons
but
for
racial
reasons.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
the
statute
in
question?
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
yes.
in
the
spring
of
'69,
early
‘69.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
we
might
indeed
still
have
the
same
problem,
your
honor.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
no
sir,
the
district
court
orders
were
entered
a
year
after
this
statute
was
passed.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
this
statute
was
passed
to
express
the
policy
of
the
state
as
being
the
same
as
the
decision
of
this
court
in
brown.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
the
district
court
in
‘65
said
that
charlotte-mecklenburg
was
a
non-racial
system.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
and
being
operated
non-racially.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
and
the
circuit
court
upheld
it.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
the
statute
was
in
69,
yes
sir.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
all
i
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
well,
whatever
context
it
be
--
context
would
be
considered
in,
your
honor.
the
point
is
this,
this
statute
said,
“the
state
of
north
carolina
adopts
as
its
policy,
this
principle
specifically
from
here
on
namely,
children
shall
not
be
barred
from
a
school
on
account
of
race
and
they
shall
not
be
assigned
to
a
school
on
account
of
race.
that's
all
it
said
and
that's
all
we
ask
enforcement
of
and
that's
all
that
our
injunction
said
and
the
only
reason
we
entitled
the
enforcement
of
our
injunction
is
because
judge
mcmillan
has
ruled
the
opposite.
he
has
said,
contrary
to
brown,
he
has
said,
“children,
you
must
go
because
of
your
race
now
into
the
schools
where
i
send
you.”
that
is
what
we
complain
of
your
honor.
