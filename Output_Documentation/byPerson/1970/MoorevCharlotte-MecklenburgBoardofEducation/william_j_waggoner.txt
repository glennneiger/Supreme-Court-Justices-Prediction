mr.
william
j.
waggoner
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
speak
very
briefly
to
the
statute.
position
the
board
has
taken
with
reference
to
the
statute
that
it
is
a
re-expression
of
the
statements
of
brown,
non-racial
assignment
of
students.
unlike
brown,
we
say
that
the
statute
also
carries
with
it
a
permission
to
disestablish
a
dual
system.
a
statute
should
be
construed
on
a
constitutional
manner
where
it
can
without
the
court's
straining
for
ridiculous
or
unwarranted
result.
mr.
william
j.
waggoner
that
state
court
in
a
non-adversary
proceeding
used
the
language
of
brown
as
i
recall
in
its
order.
i
might
point
out
circumstances
of
the
--
mr.
william
j.
waggoner
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
waggoner
insofar
as
assignment
of
students,
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
j.
waggoner
yes
sir.
mr.
william
j.
waggoner
yes
sir.
that
is
the
key
and
our
position
would
be
that
it's
perfectly
possible
under
the
statute.
a
system
being
found
dual
to
be
required
to
undo
racial
assignments
and
reassign
children
to
other
schools
based
on
proximity
and
convenience
and
other
non-racial
factors
of
sound
school
administration.
this
would
be
our
position
with
reference
to
this.
there's
some
question
about
perhaps
the
legislative
intent.
the
legislature
must
make
findings,
must
determine
public
policies.
and
if
it
finds
that
the
liberties
of
the
children
involved,
we
found
that
thus
far
this
year,
we're
transporting
an
additional
20,000
students.
this
is
a
substantial
number
of
students
who
are
being
transported.
i
do
not
say
the
full
20,000
are
assigned
involuntarily
or
by
reasons
of
race.
some
of
them
would
have
been
assigned
to
their
school
by
reason
of
proximity
and
convenience.
mr.
william
j.
waggoner
yes
sir.
mr.
william
j.
waggoner
we
are
running
school
from
7:30
in
the
morning
until
9:15
for
opening
schedules.
we
have
some
buses
that
we
acquired
in
the
past
year.
we
have
received
a
loan
of
some
14
to
16
year
old
buses
from
the
state
of
north
carolina
for
the
purpose
of
transporting.
we've
also
found
that
the
legislative
position
with
reference
to
safety
of
children
in
congested
areas
was
very
much
warranted.
we're
transporting
not
quite
twice
as
many
students.
our
accident
rate
is
up
to
440%.
mr.
william
j.
waggoner
we
refurnished
28
new
buses
by
the
state
that
were
scheduled
for
replacement
of
old
buses.
mr.
william
j.
waggoner
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
william
j.
waggoner
yes.
mr.
william
j.
waggoner
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
j.
waggoner
right.
mr.
william
j.
waggoner
there
would
be
and
at
one
time,
we
had
hoped
that
we
would
be
able
to
stretch
brown
being
intellectually
honest
to
permit
a
strained
concept
of
gerrymandered
lands.
i
don't
feel
that
the
board
plan
would
be
truly
constitutional
because
it
does
take
race
too
much
in
account
and
goes
outside
the
compactness
that
brown
spoke
off.
i
don't
think
that
the
statute
would
prohibit
a
desegregation
technique
such
as
the
location
of
a
new
school.
this
would
accomplish
the
assignment
of
students
by
locating
the
school
in
a
border
zone
where
again
they
would
be
assigned
to
school
on
objective,
non-racial
criteria.
now,
a
great
deal
of
criticism
has
been
directed
--
mr.
william
j.
waggoner
if
the
nearby
schools
are
overcrowded
and
a
school
must
be
built
in
this
area.
mr.
william
j.
waggoner
it
must
be
built
somewhere.
i
think
the
board
can
go
the
next
step
and
construct
the
school
knowing
that
the
general
attendants'
lines
will
lie
in
this
area.
no
--
mr.
william
j.
waggoner
if
there
is
a
--
if
there
was
a
choice
--
mr.
william
j.
waggoner
do
i
assume
your
question
does
not
contain
an
overcrowding
of
nearby
school?
mr.
william
j.
waggoner
i
think
that
it
would
be
within
the
leeway
of
the
board
to
locate
the
school
on
the
basis
we
must
build
a
school,
this
is
an
educational
reason
and
as
ancillary,
we
are
going
to
promote
desegregation.
mr.
william
j.
waggoner
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
waggoner
i
will
not
agree
on
zoned
lines,
redrawing
zoned
lines.
mr.
william
j.
waggoner
you
--
you'd
--
mr.
william
j.
waggoner
because
a
student
has
no
right
to
the
location
of
a
school.
there
are
many
cases
in
north
carolina
where
a
school
construction
is
sought
to
be
restrained.
this
is
the
decision
of
the
board
of
education
and
unless
there
is
an
abuse
of
discretion,
a
school
will
be
constructed
where
the
board
determines.
now
there's
been
some
suggestion
that
the
--
there
was
some
overreaching
on
the
part
of
the
board,
i'd
like
to
clear
up
one
point.
the
board
was
served
with
an
injunction
on
the
25th
of
february.
on
the
26th
we
removed
it
to
federal
court
which
was
on
thursday.
on
monday
morning
we
presented
an
order
to
the
district
court
for
relief
from
the
state
court
order
because
it
was
interfering
with
our
implementation
efforts.
we
were
at
that
time
faced
with
a
district
court
order
that's
directed
us
to
desegregate
april
first,
we
have
a
state
court
order
that
says
do
nothing
now
and
the
contempt
powers
of
the
court
are
approximately
equal,
so
we
had
to
take
the
choice
of
honoring
the
one
that
had
(inaudible).
the
legislature
may
have
had
in
mind
the
affirmative
duty
that
was
first
spelled
out
by
judge
sobeloff
in
bradley
against
richmond
and
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
the
swann
case
when
it
was
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
1966.
you'll
recall
that
judge
sobeloff
dissented
and
gave
a
very
strong
dissent
in
our
case.
in
his
concurring
end
result
--
approval
of
our
1966
plan,
he
said
this,
“this
is
far
from
suggesting
that
children
are
to
be
uprooted
arbitrarily
and
bused
against
their
will
to
distant
places
merely
to
place
them
with
children
of
the
other
race.”
here
judge
sobeloff
was
talking
about
the
affirmative
duty
even
before
green
fully
enunciated.
i
thank
you.
mr.
william
j.
waggoner
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.

that
is

mr.
william

yes

that
is
the
key
and
our

mr.

mr.

mr.

mr.

because
