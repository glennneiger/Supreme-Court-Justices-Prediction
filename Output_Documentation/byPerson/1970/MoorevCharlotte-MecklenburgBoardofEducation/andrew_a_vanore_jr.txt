mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
some
of
us
have
mislabeled
the
statute
which
is
now
before
the
court
as
an
anti-busing
statute.
in
effect,
it
is
an
anti-discrimination
statute
which
it
embraces
in
toto,
the
pronouncements
of
this
court
in
brown
versus
board
of
education.
in
that
it
says
that
“no
child
shall
be
compelled
to
attend
any
school
on
the
basis
of
race
and
no
child
shall
be
excluded
from
any
school
on
the
basis
of
race.”
we
have
long
been
labeled
in
north
carolina
as
have
some
of
the
other
southern
states
as
having
dejure
segregation.
the
problem
as
i
see
it,
may
it
please
the
court,
is
when
does
one
remove
this
label
of
dejure
segregation.
when
this
court
made
its
pronouncement
in
brown,
at
that
time
as
a
matter
of
law,
segregation
was
forever
outlawed
in
north
carolina,
dejure
segregation
was
outlawed.
i
need
not
remind
the
court
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
black.
i
think
there
is
no
question
but
that
segregation
was
wrong
but
of
course,
we
north
carolina
are
simply
until
1954,
until
this
court
reversed
its
decision
in
plessy
versus
ferguson,
we
were
doing
no
more
than
was
allowed
by
this
court
until
that
time.
now,
i
think
as
the
court
has
stated
in
green,
we
must
--
the
boards
of
education
have
an
affirmative
duty
to
do
what
is
necessary
to
come
up
with
a
plan
that
will
realistically
work.
we
contend
that
the
only
realistic
plan
that
will
work
both
for
the
north
and
the
south
and
i
do
think
that
the
dejure
de
facto
distinction
is
legal
fiction.
i
think
we
must
recognize
that
whatever
this
court
does,
this
court
must
consider
that
it
will
be
the
law
of
the
land
not
only
for
the
south
but
also
for
the
north.
the
only
realistic
approach
to
this
is
to
allow
that
each
child
attend
the
school
nearest
his
home
which
serves
his
grade,
consistent
with
school
capacity.
now
the
statute
that
is
now
before
this
court
provides
for
that
very
thing.
the
legislature
of
north
carolina
intended
as
best
it
could
to
preserve
the
neighborhood
school
concept,
a
concept
which
will
work
both
in
the
north
and
the
south.
it
seems
that
in
listening
to
the
arguments
that
were
made
yesterday,
if
this
court
is
to
adopt
an
approach
other
from
the
neighborhood
school
system
of
student
assignment.
if
this
court
is
to
adopt
a
reasonableness
approach
or
a
feasibility
approach,
we
are
going
to
have
the
same
amount
of
litigation
if
not
more
litigation
than
we
have
experienced
since
brown
when
the
court
said
that
you
must
use
all
due
deliberate
speed.
at
the
time
the
north
carolina,
the
general
assembly
enacted
this
legislation
which
was
in
july
of
1969.
there
were
two
prominent
cases
that
had
been
decided
by
the
supreme
court
that
it
had
to
go
by,
that
is
brown
and
green
and
also
the
general
assembly
was
guided
by
sections
401
and
407
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
which
we
think
this
statute
embraces
as
it
does
embrace
brown
and
green.
now
in
green
as
this
court
suggested,
of
course
that
was
a
rather
simplistic
fact
situation
there
where
you
had
only
two
schools
involved
and
the
court's
suggestion
as
i
recall
in
footnote
6
that
the
easiest
way
to
eliminate
the
dual
school
system
there,
was
to
draw
a
line
down
the
middle
of
the
county
and
all
of
the
children
in
the
eastern
end
of
the
county
would
attend
the
new
kent
school
and
all
of
the
children
in
the
western
end
of
the
county
would
attend
the
watkin
school.
now
this
we
say
was
not
necessarily
a
pronouncement
but
certainly
a
suggestion
by
this
court
that
a
child
be
assigned
or
be
allowed
to
attend
not
on
the
basis
of
race,
but
be
allowed
to
attend
a
school
nearest
his
home
and
we
say
that
this
is
exactly
what
the
statute
does.
the
statute
does
not
allow
any
assignments
as
this
court
prohibited
on
the
basis
of
race.
all
the
children
are
allowed
to
go
to
the
school
nearest
their
home
and
we
think
this
is
the
only
reasonable
way
that
this
court
can
approach
the
problem
now
before
it.
i'd
like
to
save
some
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
