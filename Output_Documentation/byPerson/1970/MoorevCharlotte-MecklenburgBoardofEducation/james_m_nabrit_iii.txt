mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
main
theme
of
my
argument
is
that
the
three-judge
district
court
which
heard
this
case
below
is
correct
in
holding
that
a
portion
of
the
state
law,
two
sentences
in
it,
the
last
two
sentences
in
the
second
paragraph
were
violated
--
the
constitution
by
interfering
with
the
school
board's
duty
to
desegregate
the
schools.
that
court
held
unanimously
that
this
was
the
effect
of
the
law
as
well
as
its
purpose.
let
me
begin
by
simply
listing
the
matters,
i
hope
to
cover
in
my
allotted
time.
first,
i
would
like
to
state
a
bit
about
the
procedural
history
of
this
case
and
discuss
some
of
the
facts
about
school
busing.
the
factual
background
against
which
the
statute
is
enacted,
not
against
which
it
actually
functions
and
in
that
connection,
i
should
tell
the
court
that
in
number
498,
the
parties
have
stipulated
and
the
court
below
also
considered
that
the
entire
record
in
the
swann
case,
which
was
argued
yesterday
was
a
part
to
be
considered
in
the
three-judge
court
case.
third,
i
hope
to
discuss
briefly
the
meaning
of
the
statutory
provisions
and
the
various
interpretations
the
parties
have
given
of
it
and
fourth,
the
main
point
why
we
think
the
statute
violates
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
if
you
will
turn
your
honor
to
the
appellees'
brief
and
there's
number
498,
the
brief
for
appellees',
the
first
page
of
the
argument
which
is
--
it's
quoted
there
in
the
footnote.
see
the
footnote
number
eight.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
the
footnote
at
page
20.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
page
20.
and
the
part
that
the
court
below
held
was
unconstitutional.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
and
then
it's
the
only
part
that
we
attacked
--
was
the
last
two
sentences
in
the
second
paragraph
and
they
appear
near
--
over
on
21
and
then
continuing
in
that
footnote.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
those
two
sentences.
i
also
hope,
if
i
have
time
to
--
well,
in
connection
with
the
main
argument
about
the
statute
violating
the
equal
protection
clause,
i
think
the
--
particularly
interesting,
the
contradictory
positions
taken
by
the
parties
because
if
i
heard
them
correctly,
mr.
wagner
representing
the
school
board
stated
quite
clearly
that
he
thought
the
school
board's
plan
of
desegregation
as
the
board
has
presented
to
judge
mcmillan
defended
in
the
fourth
circuit,
defended
here
by
its
own
petition
for
certiorari
and
in
its
brief
that
the
school
board's
plan
says
mr.
wagner
violates
the
brown
case
and
it's
unconstitutional
because
he
says
it
accomplishes
too
much
desegregation.
that
is
indeed
an
amazing
turn
of
events.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
no,
but
because
of
the
technique
that
the
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
right.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
i
--
let
me
address
that
because
i
think
that
my
point
is,
that
his
position
is
inconsistent
and
i
hope
to
develop
that
in
that
part
of
my
argument.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
the
court
below
held
that
the
both
of
the
sentences
were
unconstitutional
because
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes
it
did,
i
think
so.
that
it
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
mr.
justice
black,
the
court
below
held
that
that
sentence,
the
whole
sentence
was
unconstitutional
including
that
clause
and
the
next
clause.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes
sir
i
do
because
it
interferes
with
the
school
board's
--
it
imposes
blinders
on
the
school
board.
it
says
you
cannot
consider
race
in
a
context
of
a
segregated
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
but
--
as
i
--
i
understand
that
to
be
the
argument,
however
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
mr.
justice
black,
i
understand
the
brown
case
to
hold
that
compulsory
school
segregation
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
and
that
the
statute,
the
court
below
held
in
north
carolina
where
they
still
have
school
segregation,
prevents
the
school
board
from
doing
its
duty
of
abolishing
that
discriminatory
system.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
it
tells
the
school
board
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
it
tells
the
school
board
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
the
court
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
the
court
below
didn't
understand
it
that
way
and
that's
not
the
understanding
that
the
state
court
judges
gave
it
or
that
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
we
cannot
understand
that
sentence
merely
on
the
basis
of
that
first
clause,
it
says
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
the
statute
was
on
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that's
right.
the
statute
was
specifically
designed
to
overturn
judge
mcmillan's
order
and
that's
a
history
and
it
attempts
to
do
this
by
saying
the
state
must
be
colorblind.
it
cannot
integrate
the
schools
because
it
cannot
take
into
account
race
at
all
in
assigning
students
or
in
transferring
and
that
it
cannot
do
anything
for
a
racial
purpose
in
connection
with
assigning
students.
if
you
can't,
if
you
have
as
--
and
if
you
have
an
existing
system
of
all
black
schools
and
all
white
schools,
this
statute
says
you
can't
do
anything
about
it
because
you
must
be
blind
to
the
race
of
the
students.
and
that
was
the
understanding
that
the
three
judges
below
gave
to
this
statute
and
that
was
certainly
its
intent
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
the
-
that
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
this
is
the
way
it's
been
applied
by
the
north
carolina
judges.
although
this
is
the
way
and
this
is
its
purpose,
it's
the
way
its
applied
by
the
north
carolina
judge.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
not
at
all
sir.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
may
i
say
mr.
justice
black
that
on
this
issue,
the
federal
courts
have
been
--
below
have
been
entirely
consistent
that
this
sort
of
evasion
of
brown
cannot
be
permitted
that
an
artificial
assertion
of
non-discrimination
of
trapped
cannot
be
permitted
to
stand
in
a
way
of
actually
accomplishing
a
reform
of
the
segregated
system.
all
the
federal
courts
that
have
considered
this
argument
have
rejected
it
quite
uniformly.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
and
it's
important
that
none
of
the
argument
on
the
other
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
and
that
the
statute
is
a
subterfuge
and
that's
what
judge
craven
held
and
the
court
below
held
that
it
was
a
subterfuge.
let
me
state
a
few
facts
mr.
justice
black
about
busing
and
let
me
begin
by
answering
the
question
that
you've
asked
twice
about
what
is
the
law
in
this
bus
routes.
if
you
will
turn
to
the
petitioner's
brief
in
number
281,
judge
mcmillan
made
a
specific
finding
on
this
ay
appendix
page
24
in
the
brief
in
number
281,
now
the
swann
case.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
at
the
--
page
24
of
the
appendix,
judge
mcmillan
states,
“the
longest
bus
routes
in
the
entire
county
are
the
routes
by
which
four
and
five-year
old
kindergarten
children
are
transported
to
child
development
centers.”
see,
principles
monthly

the

mr.
justice
black,
judge
mcmillan
made
a
detailed
study
of
this
subject
of
busing.
i
have
in
my
hand
the
exhibits
which
list
every
bus
route
in
the
county.
the
drivers
name,
all
the
stops
he
makes,
all
the
time,
judge
mcmillan's
findings
on
this
were
based
on
an
in-depth
study
of
this
busing
system
and
of
course
in
that
paragraph
there
are
descriptions
of
other
buses.
that
one
i
mentioned,
the
longest
one
was
a
kindergarten

but
of
course
there
are
other
trips
nearly
as
long

the
regular

class.

he
mentions
another
trip
over
70

to

and

mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
now
this
is
last
october
before
the
plan.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
the
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that
--
that's
the
--
those
--
the
bayne
elementary
finding
which
is
ordinary
elementary
school,
the
busing
was
based
on
the
school
board's
zones
which
are
not
drawn
on
the
basis
of
proximity
but
drawn
on
the
basis
of
discretion,
but
nevertheless
they
are
the
zones.
the
school
board
decides
where
it
shapes
its
zones
for
its
own
purposes.
but
in
any
event,
this
case
has
a
complete
record
on
the
subject
of
the
busing
and
the
transportation
system
and
all
of
those
questions
can
be
answered,
the
answers
to
all
of
those
questions
can
be
ascertained
by
the
record.
let
me
state
just
a
few
general
facts
about
busing.
first
it's
wide
spread.
in
this
nation
40%
of
all
the
children
who
go
to
school
everyday
ride
school
buses,
18
million
of
them.
that's
documented
in
the
amicus
curiae
briefs,
the
ex
parte
one
by
national
education
association.
it's
also
a
finding
in
this
record.
in
north
carolina,
610,000
children
a
day,
55%
of
all
the
children
ride
school
buses
every
day.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
they
are
not
merely
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
no,
no,
no,
no.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
i
was
trying
to
state
a
few
facts
upon
--
the
background
upon
which
this
statute
is
enacted
before
i
discuss
its
application.
these
are
not
only
children
in
the
counties,
they
include
city
children.
the
way
the
law
is
applied
in
north
carolina,
the
state
up
until
last
year
paid
for
all
children
who
bused
in
the
county
areas
but
also
in
those
areas
inside
city
limits,
that
had
been
annexed
in
the
past
13
years,
any
area
annexed
since
1957
and
these
are
exhibits
i
got
out
of
the
record
room
this
morning
which
show
that
a
large
part
of
charlotte
had
been
annexed
and
these
children
are
bused
at
state
expense
in
the
red
area
and
of
course
all
those
outside
it.
in
addition,
anyone
who
travels
from
the
center
to
the
outside
is
bused
at
state
expense
and
anyone
who
travels
in
any
direction.
since
judge
mcmillan's
opinion,
the
state
has
changed
this
regulations
and
now
all
children
in
the
state
of
north
carolina
under
the
current
regulations,
no
matter
where
they
live
in,
the
city
or
the
county
are
entitled
to
busing
at
state
expenses
they
lived
more
than
a
mile
and
a
half
from
school.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
mr.
justice
black,
that
argument
is
not
necessary
to
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
it
is
--
it
has
not
been
made
because
we
don't
face
any
such
facts.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
however,
if
that
were
to
happen,
the
inquiry
would
have
to
be
whether
or
not,
it
had
a
racially
discriminatory
effect.
it
wouldn't
seem
in
neutral
circumstances
to
be
discriminatory
to
say,
“oh!
no
one
gets
a
bus
ride.”
but
just
like
the
school
closing
in
prince
edward
county,
it
might
under
some
circumstances
taking
away
busing
have
a
discriminatory
effect.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
all
this
was
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
the
state's
power
is
plenary
unless
it's
the
effect
is
to
make
a
racial
discrimination.
at
that
point
the
equal
protection
clause
would
prohibit
it
and
that
requires
an
examination
of
a
record
and
facts
and
we
don't
have
that
case
but
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that's
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
that
that
was
the
argument
that
was
made
where
the
--
in
the
griffin
case
your
honor
where
the
school
board
abolished,
they
closed
down
all
the
public
schools
in
(inaudible)
county.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
that's
the
inquiry
i'm
suggesting
would
have
to
be
made
whether
or
not
it's
discriminatory.
that's
the
only
inquiry
i'm
suggesting.
the
state's
power
is
also
plenary
in
determining
the
boundaries
of
municipalities
but
in
gomillion
against
lightfoot,
the
court
inquired
as
to
whether
or
not
that
kind
of
power
was
used
to
get
a
discriminatory
effect
to
deprive
blacks
of
the
right
to
vote.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that's
the
same
kind
of
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that
--
the
equal
protection,
that's
the
only
thing
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
in
charlotte-mecklenburg,
the
board's
own
figures
and
this
is
at
page
619a
of
the
swann
record,
the
record
in
number
281
show
10,414
elementary
children
last
year
rode
buses.
in
other
words,
42%
of
the
total
children
bused
in
charlotte
were
elementary
children
even
though
the
elementary
schools
are
ordinarily
closer
to
home
than
the
high
school.
so
the
system
was
that
we
are
dealing
with
as
busing
as
an
integral
part
of
the
normal
educational
program
for
elementary
children
as
well
as
for
high
school
children.
now,
this
record
tell
--
i
think
dispels
some
of
the
misconceptions
about
how
costly
busing
gets
to
be,
the
average
state
cost
for
a
pupil
for
a
whole
year
in
the
state
of
north
carolina
is
$23.40.
the
cost
in
charlotte-mecklenburg
is
about
the
same,
around
$20.00
to
bus
a
pupil
for
the
whole
year.
what's
involved
judge
mcmillan
found
was
a
cost
that
amounted
to
about
the
operating
expenses
of
the
school,
the
charlotte
system
for
two
days
out
of
the
year
and
that's
the
kind
of
finances
we're
dealing
with
in
relation
to
the
overall
picture.
it's
a
66
million
dollar
budget
school
system.
this
is
just
two
days
a
year
out
of
it.
the
busing
plan
that
judge
mcmillan
ordered
is
as
the
court
knows
in
effect,
judge
mcmillan
found
that
it
went
into
effect
and
the
plan
we've
been
talking
about
for
two
days
is
an
operation,
it's
functioning
this
morning,
it
has
been
for
several
weeks.
under
this
court's
denial
of
the
stay
under
the
pendente
lite
rule
of
alexander
against
holmes
county.
judge
mcmillan
found
that
the
board
had
no
need
to
make
any
additional
capital
expenditures
in
the
current
year
because
he
found
out
that
the
last
hearing
in
july,
the
board
had
in
effect
been
hiding
buses.
his
opinion
states
and
it's
--
in
that
same
opinion
that
i
referred
to
you
a
moment
ago
mr.
justice
black
at
page
18
of
the
appendix
to
petitioner's
brief
in
number
281.
this
is
the
august
3rd
memorandum,
that
the
school
board
had
in
effect
been
--
not
only
been
exaggerating
its
bus
needs
in
all
of
the
argument
but
had
led
the
court
to
believe
that
they
actually
owned
the
107
--
around
a
hundred
less
buses
than
they
had.
and
he
found
that
their
$5
million
cost
estimates
that
were
banded
on
all
over
the
nation
including
the
papers
filed
in
this
court
last
spring
were
bordered
on
fantasy
and
he
referred
it
to
alice
in
wonderland
and
i
was
there
and
we
had
again
in
july,
five
days
of
testimony
about
these
bus
estimates
and
judge
mcmillan's
finding
and
he
heard
the
witnesses
and
he
saw
these
thousands
of
names
on
paper
was
indeed
--
these
are
opinion
statements
about
the
busing
were
not
worthy
--
.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
no
sir.
the
court
of
appeals
accepted
judge
mcmillan's
findings
based
on
a
study
of
the
record.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
that's
correct
but
his
conclusion
was
that
his
original
findings
were
essentially
still
correct
based
on
all
these
new
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that's
true.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that
record
is
here
and
its
printed
and
it
was
just
filed
recently
by
the
school
board
and
it's
printed
appendix
in
number
349,
this
has
the
entire
transcript.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
and
many
of
the
exhibits
of
the
hearing.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
but
mr.
waggoner's
asserting
some
new
facts,
brand
new
facts
this
morning
about
accident
rates
and
all
that.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
entirely
correct.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
judge
mcmillan
--
no,
it
does
not.
judge
mcmillan's
finding
was
that
they
could
establish
the
needs
on
the
basis
of
actual
practice
with
the
buses
that
were
available
free
of
charge
from
the
state
board
of
education.
they'd
have
to
buy
them
next
year.
of
course,
what
one
must
understand
in
relation
to
that
is
that
the
school
board
--
that
judge
mcmillan's
findings
are
based
on
what
they
needed
to
do.
but
it's
always
been
in
the
school
board's
interest
to
exaggerate
this
and
to
devise
routes
based
on
inefficient
principles
--
and
all
that
there
estimates
based
on
running
a
less
sufficient
bus
system
than
they
were
actually
running
and
that's
why
they
got
all
those
inflated
estimates.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that's
the
judge's
finding.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
i
agree
and
what
i
want
to
talk
about
is
the
subject
to
--
next
is
the
subject
you
are
raising,
i
think
it
is
not
peripheral
because
of
the
arguments
by
the
school
board
and
the
solicitor
general
that
in
the
fourth
circuit
opinion,
the
reasonableness
doctrine
depends
on
assessing
all
of
these
factors
in
some
way
and
adding
them
up
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
certainly
and
then
judge
mcmillan
viewed
it
that
way
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
judge
mcmillan
made
all
these
detailed
findings
about
the
busing
and
the
cost
and
all
that
at
the
request
of
the
court
of
appeals
at
the
time
the
stay
was
granted.
the
court
stayed
this
order
and
said,
“give
give
us
detailed
findings
about
this.”
but
let's
talk
about
the
central
issues
in
the
statute.
the
law
prohibits
assigning
or
compelling
students
on
the
basis
of
race.
that's
the
colorblind
provision
and
also
in
the
same
purpose,
assignment
for
the
purpose
of
creating
a
balance
or
ratio
of
race.
now
the
court
below
in
its
opinion
held
that
this
wasn't
a
legislative
effort
to
limit
school
boards
to
either
freedom
of
choice
plans
and
other
part
of
the
statute
or
the
so-called
neighborhood
school
concept.
this
is
the
basis
on
which
the
attorney
general
and
the
court
below
defended
the
statute.
the
decision
below
relies
on
this.
this
is
from
the
brief
by
the
attorney
general
of
north
carolina
about
what
the
statute
means.
it
says
the
above
quoted
statute,
general
statute
115-176.1
is
really
nothing
but
the
embodiment
of
the
neighborhood
school
concept.
and
as
we
will
attempt
to
show,
the
neighborhood
school
is
legitimate
in
legal
school
facility
and
should
not
be
broken
up
or
fragmented
to
correct
racial
imbalance.
this
statute
was
designed
obviously
to
eliminate
transportation
cost
and
permit
the
student
to
remain
as
near
his
or
her
home
as
possible.
stated
another
way,
the
statute
was
designed
to
require
that
local
school
administrative
units
throughout
the
state
operate
as
nearly
as
possible
under
the
so
called
neighborhood
assignment
system.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
my
call
is
based
on
the
equal
protection
clause
and
only
that.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
the
--
i
agree
with
the
court
below.
it
says,
federal
courts
don't
sit
to
review
school
board
policies,
legislative
policies
about
how
they
allocate
their
resources.
our
argument
is
based
only
on
the
claim
that
this
statute
denies
equal
protection
of
the
laws
because
it
interferes
with
school
boards
in
carrying
out
their
obligations,
their
affirmative
duties
under
the
brown
case.
and
in
the
attorney
general's
brief
--
in
this
court
makes
a
frontal
challenge
to
green,
it
takes
a
sentence
out
of
green
where
this
court
said
there
shall
be
--
there
should
be
no
white
schools
or
black
schools,
there
should
just
be
schools.
attorney
general's
brief
here
takes
a
sentence
out
of
green
and
says
that
can
never
happen.
and
that's
pointed
out
in
our
brief
in
this
case.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
he
has
indeed
and
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
the
solicitor
general
filed
a
brief,
memorandum
of
the
united
states
as
amicus
curiae
in
444
and
498.
and
it
is
my
submission
and
he
urges
as
we
do
that
the
court
below
should
be
affirmed.
however,
it's
my
view
that
this
position
of
the
solicitor
general
in
this
case
is
entirely
inconsistent
with
the
argument
yesterday
cause
i
understood
the
solicitor
general's
argument
yesterday
to
be
that
the
choice
before
the
court
was
between
something
called
racial
balance
which
he
attributed
to
us.
and
something
that
solicitor
general
supported
which
was
called
the
neighborhood
school
assignment
system.
now,
the
holding
of
the
court
below
in
the
three-judge
court
case
is
that
this
statute
embraces,
embodies
the
neighborhood
school
assignment
system
and
yet
the
solicitor
general's
memorandum
in
the
three-judge
case
says
this,
“in
many
cases,
neither
freedom
of
choice
nor
racially
neutral
zoning
is
adequate
to
disestablish
the
former
dual
system.”
we
agree
with
that
exactly.
it
goes
on
to
the
stay.
other
steps
such
as
pairing
or
consolidating
schools,
redrawing
boundary
lines,
restructuring
transportation
routes
or
any
combination
of
these
may
be
required.
i
cannot
understand
how
someone
who
adheres
to
that
position
can
contend
that
judge
mcmillan's
decision
must
be
overturned.
i
just
don't
understand
how
the
two
arguments
fit.
i
do
understand
why
the
solicitor
general
has
to
adopt
that
view.
it's
because
this
statute
would
also
invalidate
the
hew
plan
because
the
plan
for
charlotte
developed
by
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare
embraces
the
school
boards
gerrymandered
zones
and
goes
further
with
them,
it
combines
them
into
groups
of
schools,
so
that
if
the
solicitor
general
has
not
made
the
argument
that
mr.
waggoner
made
for
the
school
board
that
is
on
plan
as
unconstitutional.
but
mr.
justice
white
in
questioning
one
of
the
counsels
asked
whether
or
not
rezoning
to
promote
integration
changing
the
lines
that
--
by
which
the
school
board
defines
what
a
school's
neighborhood
is
for
the
purpose
of
integrating
the
schools
whether
or
not
that
violates
the
statute,
and
i
understood
counsel
say
that
it
did.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
think
not.
i
think
that
is
precisely
this
lawsuit
because
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
no.
not
in
the
general
sense
but
in
the
particular
sense
that
the
--
there
is
no
escaping
the
fact
that
those
choices,
those
decisions,
those
routine
every
day
decisions
by
a
school
board
about
where
the
school
goes,
i
mean,
who
--
the
size,
the
grade
structure,
that
is
what
--
those
are
the
decisions
that
are
used
to
manipulate
these
school
systems
and
keep
them
all
black
and
all
white
so
it
is
necessary
to
look
at
those
techniques
in
order
to
stop
the
segregation,
to
stop
the
discrimination.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
i
think
the
case
does
raise
that
point
because
mr.
blakeney's
clients
went
into
the
state
superior
court
in
mecklenburg
county
and
got
an
injunction
which
restrained
the
school
board
from
carrying
out
this
kind
of
stuff.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
he
restrained
them
--
well,
let's
look
at
the
terms
of
that.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
mr.
justice
black,
that
is
why
we
submit
that
the
test
we
urge
for
--
that
the
court
order
adopt
is
a
test
based
on
results,
the
test
based
on
actually
desegregating
the
system
and
that
these
other
--
and
that
no
one
else
in
the
case,
not
the
solicitor
general,
not
the
school
board,
none
of
the
amicus
curiae
supporting
their
position
are
answering
the
questions
that
they
rhetorically
asserted
it
have
to
be
answered
as
what
is
the
unitary
system,
but
none
of
them
were
saying
how
would
--
giving
any
concrete
basis
for
instructing
a
school
superintendent
or
district
court
how
it
is,
he
runs
his
school
system
so
it
won't
be
discriminatory
and
it
can
remove
segregation.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
if
i
leave
out
the
whole
history
of
state
racial
discrimination
against
blacks
in
the
country
or
in
the
state,
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that
the
state
has
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
if
the
states
had
been
colorblind
from
the
beginning
and
we've
never
had
slavery
and
we've
never
have
racial
segregation
then
i
wouldn't
be
here.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that's
right.
but
the
essence
of
my
submission
is
to
look
at
this
statute
as
they
exist
in
the
world
we
know.
the
world
where
--
the
states
have
done
everything
they
can,
including
the
school
board
and
they
have
resisted
judge
mcmillan's
orders
and
everywhere
they
know
how
to
keep
racial
segregation
and
this
court
knows
that
history.
the
solicitor
general
referred
to
it
yesterday
in
talking
about
little
rock
and
all
that
but
i
disagree
that
it's
all
over.
this
war
against
the
brown
case
is
still
going
on,
it's
just
in
a
much
more
subtle
form
and
that's
why
we
have
to
deal
with
these
details
about
how
school
boards
run
their
systems
because
they're
not
engaging
in
more
sophisticated
types
of
evasion.
that
is
what
this
case
is
all
about.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
that's
correct
about
my
main
argument.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
it's
not
correct
about
my
other
two
arguments.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
right.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
oh,
i'm
saying
that
and
i
am
also
saying
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i'm
also
saying
--
well,
i
certainly
see
that.
but
i
also
submit
that
the
brown
case
requires
a
result.
the
brown
case
requires
an
actual
reform
of
the
school
system,
so
the
constitution
does
require
if
that
is
to
be
accomplished
in
fact
that
the
goal
be
achieved.
and
it
can
be
achieved
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
understood
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
or
maybe
i
didn't
hear
the
question.
i
understood
the
--
well,
the
answer
is
yes,
but
the
brown
case
requires
something
more
that
that's
my
only
point.
the
brown
case
requires
--
the
brown
case
held
that
the
separate
schools
for
blacks
were
inherently
unequal
and
had
to
be
abolished
as
--
and
it
was
not
simply
a
decision
based
on
the
existence
of
a
racial
classification.
now,
this
neighborhood
school
concept
in
the
context
of
a
system
like
charlotte
insofar
as
i've
been
able
to
tell
in
the
context
of
all
the
school
segregation
cases
in
the
courts
now
a
days.
this
neighborhood
school
concept
is
really
a
fiction.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
a
fiction.
it
certainly
never
existed
in
charlotte.
no
one
in
this
case
in
charlotte,
certainly
not
the
school
board,
not
the
hew
plan
that
the
united
states
presented
is
proposing
that
pupils
be
assigned
on
the
simple
basis
that
mr.
vanore
stated,
that
is,
“no
one
has
proposed
that
the
assigned
pupils
in
charlotte
schools
to
the
closest
school
that
can
hold
them
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
would
think
that
on
the
facts
of
charlotte
it's
unconstitutional.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
have
nothing
against
that
policy
and
that
policy
is
not
per
se
unconstitutional.
but
it
does
produce
an
unconstitutional
result
where
the
neighborhoods
are
racially
defined
by
the
state
as
in
charlotte
or
where
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
they
accomplished
precisely
that
by
a
series
of
administrative
steps
in
the
small
decisions,
precisely
then
they
defined
the
neighborhood
racially
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
why?
this
has
really
two
aspects.
yes,
the
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
there
is
no
law
applicable
to
charlotte.
no
racial
segregation
ordinance
applicable
to
charlotte.
but
the
same
thing
has
been
accomplished
in
charlotte
by
the
use
of
the
--
whole
record
we
made
on
the
zoning,
on
the
way
that
the
black
neighborhoods
were
treated
differently
in
the
zoning,
on
the
way
the
public
housing
was
built,
the
government
and
the
way
the
urban
renewal
moved
the
people
around.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
judgment
--
judge
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
think
the
choice
is
that
we
--
judge
mcmillan
made
a
finding
that
that's
what
has
been
going
on
in
charlotte
so
that
the
choice
is,
the
choice
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that
the
government
had
been
accomplishing
residential
segregation
by
these
several
methods
in
charlotte.
so
that
the
choice
that
gives
us
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
we
don't
seek
to.
we
seek
to
integrate
the
schools
on
the
simple
thesis
that
schools,
their
residents
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
the
school
board
is
not
proposing
to
give
them
schools
in
their
areas
and
they
never
have.
so
that's
not
the
decision
that
i
have
made
or
that
the
plaintiffs
in
the
case
have
made
but
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
mr.
justice
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
i
don't
describe
my
position
that
way.
no
sir,
let's
take
a
concrete
example
of
--
let's
look
at
an
example
of
what
judge
mcmillan
was
faced
with.
he's
faced
with
something
that
--
on
this
piece
of
cardboard
which
we
showed
you
yesterday,
we
just
simply
made
tracings
of
a
proposal
about
how
you
treat
the
pupils
in
this
particular
area
and
the
red
outline
is
the
government's
proposal
for
this
particular
area
and
the
black
outline
is
the
one
judge
mcmillan
ordered
and
let
me
take
it
very
specifically
in
an
effort
to
show
you
not
that
something
particular
wrong
with
this
--
not
that
somebody
made
a
mistake
about
this
particular
thing
but
an
effort
to
illustrate
the
principle
that
there
really
is
no
difference
between
this
racial
balanced
idea
that
we
are
charged
with
and
then
neighborhood
school
idea
that
the
others
say,
they
are
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
this
is
the
hew
neighborhood
school.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
oh!
yes.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
understand
that.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
agree
with
them
mr.
justice
white.
i
quote
the
hew
neighborhood,
the
hew
neighborhood
plan.
so,
it's
what
it
does.
the
one
that
the
solicitor
general
supports.
there's
a
black
school
here,
down
at
this
part
i'm
pointing
to
is
called
lincoln
heights
and
there's
a
white
school
here
that
is
called
dorieta
(ph)
and
there's
a
white
school
here
called
statesville
road
and
all
three
of
them
have
grades
one
through
six
last
year.
the
school
board
constructed
some
zone
lines
in
there,
proposed
the
integration
plan.
it
left
lincoln
heights,
a
100%
black.
so
the
hew
proposed
to
cure
that
by
combining
all
three
into
one
big
school
zone,
combining
all
three
in
to
one
big
school
zone
and
saying
that
children
in
the
first
two
grades
will
go
to
dorieta
(ph)
over
here,
children
in
grades
three
and
four
will
go
to
statesville
road
and
the
children
in
grades
five
and
six,
even
those
white
children
that
were
here
go
to
the
black
school
in
the
ghetto
in
grades
five
and
six,
alright?
now,
that
is
defended
as
neighborhood
schools
and
this
is
a
particularly
large
and
non-compact
example
of
this
but
this
is
neighborhood
schools,
hew
style.
now,
the
black
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
school
board
opposes
this.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
but
you
can
--
i'm
not
trying
to
advocate
this
particular
zone.
i'm
tying
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes,
yes
your
honor.
the
brief
of
the
united
states
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
the
solicitor
general's
submission
to
be
accurate
about
it
is
that
the
case
ought
to
be
remanded
and
judge
mcmillan
should
understand
the
correct
legal
principle
that
that
is
a
valid
plan
and
the
school
board
ought
to
be
permitted
that
choice.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
this
really
isn't
just
--
this
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
let
me
be
clear.
this
is
very
much
representative
of
what
the
united
states
government
is
requiring
all
over
the
south
because
their
principle
is,
the
only
way
you
integrate,
its
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
the
only
way
you
integrate
is
you
combine
--
is
you
rezone
or
you
combine
contiguous
zones.
he
has
the
three
methods
listed
their
in
his
brief,
its
combining
contiguous
zones
and
our
point
is
that
from
the
stand
point
of
the
actual
practical
operations
of
the
school
system
of
the
actual
practical
effect
on
the
child,
this
principle
of
contiguity
doesn't
have
any
meaning.
it's
the
same
to
the
child
whether
he's
bused
across
this
intervening
area
or
that
you
can
draw
a
big
line
around
it
and
he
is
bused
the
same
distance.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
what
i
would
suggest
is
that
judge
mcmillan
said
it
precisely
right
when
he
said
that
the
neighborhood
school
concept
whatever
may
be
its
value
has
no
standing
in
the
constitution
to
overwrite
the
constitutional
duty
of
the
school
board.
it
has
no
standing
to
block
the
board
from
performing
its
affirmative
duty
to
change
the
unitary
system.
if
you
assume
that
--
if
you
assume
mr.
justice
black
that
the
neighborhoods
are
really
natural
and
the
people
are
voluntarily
moved
there
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
--
you
still
have
say
--
no
they're
not.
none
on
these
findings
but
you
still
--
even
if
you
make
that
assumption
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
no,
that
the
neighborhoods
are
racial.
that
the
neighborhood's
--
well,
that
saying
neighborhood
system
is
the
same
as
saying
racial
system.
it's
not
the
same
as
saying
non-racial
and
neutral
system,
that
is
the
finding.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
and
that
is
basically
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
mr.
justice
black,
if
we
had
ever
seen
in
any
of
these
cases
a
real
neighborhood
system
based
on
every
child
going
to
the
closest
school
system,
and
“to
the
closest
school”
then
we
might
say
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
is
upsetting
some
established
practice.
but
we
don't
have
that
in
charlotte.
they've
never
had
that
in
mobile.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
it
certainly
happens
that
sometimes
pupils
attend
the
closest
school
but
these
city
school
systems
are
not
operated
on
any
kind
of
basis
of
strict
proximity
that
when
you
got
a
103
schools
like
charlotte
has,
if
it's
--
that
--
they're
not
just
wrong
that
way.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
no,
your
honor,
not
at
all.
i
take
it
by
that,
that
you
mean
do
--
you
mean
state
actually
refers
to
housing?
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
no,
no.
the
housing
discrimination.
we
have
no
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes,
i
would
provided
i
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
but
i
--
but
its
because
its
not
only
the
housing
practices
that
are
racial,
the
school
assignment
practice
has
it
been
racial
ever
since
brown.
it's
the
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
the
--
your
observation
is
entirely
correct
that
that
is
not
essential
to
that.
that
judge
mcmillan
didn't
regard
it
as
essential
to
his
decision
and
we
don't
believe
it
so
because
the
school
assignment
practices
are
--
the
dual
zones
are
using
busing
to
keep
the
school
segregated.
busing
children
passed
their
nearest
school
to
keep
them
segregated.
all
of
those
practices
are
--
that
--
mr.
justice
black
there
is
an
exhibit
in
the
opinion
by
judge
mcmillan
at
page
1206a
of
this
third
volume
of
281
which
list
the
nine
schools
that
the
school
board
would
leave
all
black.
and
all
of
them
but
one,
were
either
built
since
brown
or
had
additions
put
on
them
since
brown,
or
enlarged
or
improved.
so
that
--
what
we're
looking
at
is
institutions
constructed
on
all
black
segregated
basis
since
brown
when
judge
mcmillan
has
dealing
with
the
reality
of
life
in
a
community
where
the
school
board
has
been
engaging
in
all
of
these
chicanery
to
keep
school
board
--
the
school
segregated
and
it's
his
job
to
find
a
remedy
for
that
and
we
suggest
that
the
only
administrable
principle
is
not
some
--
you'll
never
get
the
schools
integrated.
if
you
tell
a
district
judge
as
to
go
--
develop
a
reasonable
plans
or
operate
on
one
of
this
verbal
formulations
that
is
based
on
something
other
than
doing
the
job.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well.
judge
mcmillan
proceeded
and
precisely
that
kind
of
common
law
--
this
tradition.
he
said
he
was
deciding
this
case
on
its
facts
and
on
charlotte.
he
wasn't
trying
to
make
law
for
the
whole
country.
he
was
deciding
a
case
on
the
record
beforehand.
it
is
a
detailed
the
record.
it
is
the
--
i'm
sure
the
most
detailed
record
on
the
subject
of
busing
that
in
relation
to
school
desegregation
that's
ever
been
made
and
then
the
suggestion
that
three
ought
to
have
a
remand
for
some
further
proceedings
it
seems
to
me
is
a
suggestion
that
not
that
the
court
clarify
the
law
for
the
guidance
of
the
school
board
but
a
suggestion
that
we
have
more
confusion
and
more
lack
of
clarity.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
no,
that
was
the
question
i
thought
i
answered
for
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
said
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
its
not
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
its
because
the
court's
traditional
approached
to
this
problem
as
state
actions
is
to
look
at
the
whole
factual
pattern
and
then
in
all
the
background
path
and
we
don't
rely
on
anyone
factor
and
we
certainly
don't
rely
on
anyone
novel
a
--
for
a
state
action
approach
where
we've
got
all
these
conventional
state
action
namely,
school's
run
on
a
compulsory
segregated
basis
right
up
until
july
1969,
the
school
system
ran
with
25
black
schools.
two
thirds
of
the
children
on
a
freedom
or
transfer
plan
just
like
that
in
the
ray
case,
the
monroe
case
from
jackson,
tennessee,
that
was
a
companion
of
green.
the
--
so
that
the
--
there's
so
much
conventional
state
action.
we
don't
have
to
deal
with
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
why
--
certainly
he
thought
it
had
some
bearing
on
the
matter,
i
mean,
and
i
think
that
is
correct
but
i
do
not
believe
its
correct
to
say
that
the
decision
hinges
on
it
or
that
it
depends
on
it.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
but
let
me
--
if
i
may
take
an
example,
i
mean,
of
the
relevance
of
this
kind
of
evidence,
to
the
concrete
one.
the
two
schools
that
hew
were
going
leave
black
were
oakland
and
double
oak.
double
oaks
school
is
a
school
built
right
in
the
midst
of
a
low
income
federal
housing
project.
that's
the
most
dejure
neighborhood
in
town.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
and
the
suggestion
that
--
that
that's
the
school
to
be
left
all
black
seems
to
me
contradicts
the
brown
decision.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
appreciate
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
use
an
additional
ten
minutes
if
the
court
will
allow.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
to
--
just
merely
to
state
two
additional
arguments
which
are
made
in
our
brief
and
in
the
process
i
think
add
to
my
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question
which
suppose
that
this
statute
was
adopted
in
an
entirely
neutral
atmosphere,
perhaps
hundreds
of
years
ago
outside
any
context
of
--
a
history
of
segregation
and
so
forth.
the
first
of
the
two
arguments
is
the
one
we
set
out
in
our
brief
in
which
the
court
below
relied
on
based
on
the
supremacy
clause.
now
that
argument
of
course
would
not
apply
to
this
hypothetical
statute
adopted
in
another
environment.
the
second
argument
i
will
make
based
on
the
principle
decided
in
hunter
against
erickson
and
the
lucid
opinion
by
judge
paul
hays
last
week
involving
the
new
york
statute
might
apply
in
that
other
situation
and
i'm
talking
about
that.
and
i'd
like
to
conclude
by
returning
to
what
we
mean
by
racially
identifiable
school.
now,
the
supremacy
clause
issue
is
i
think
quite
simple
and
quite
fundamental.
it
is
that
the
statute
constitutes
a
practical
interference
with
the
remedial
powers
of
the
district
judge.
even
if
we
accept
mr.
waggoner's
interpretation
of
what
the
statute
means,
that
is
true.
mr.
waggoner
says
that
the
statute
only
applies
after
you
have
a
unitary
system
and
then
when
you
do,
you
can
no
longer
use
race.
and
that
the
statute
forbids
--
thus
prohibits
the
school
board
from
using
race
to
go
beyond
the
requirements
of
brown.
you
can
go
up
to
the
requirements
of
brown
but
not
beyond
it.
and
practically
what
does
that
do?
what
did
it
do
in
this
case?
it
put
the
school
board
in
the
position
of
having
a
federal
judge
who
would
enjoin
them
to
come
up
to
the
requirements
of
brown
do
the
minimum
--
to
do
at
least
the
minimum
necessary
to
comply
with
brown.
and
a
state
judge
who
would
enjoin
them
and
that
you
can't
take
a
one
step
beyond
it,
that
you
can't
go
one
inch
beyond
the
minimum
federal
constitutional
requirements.
now,
the
statute
is
overbroad
in
general
and
vague
as
this
is
--
which
sets
up
that
kind
of
collision
between
the
federal
power
and
the
state
judge's
power.
it
is
a
practical
interference
with
the
remedial
files
of
the
federal
courts
as
the
courts
below
erred.
and
the
same
thing
was
found
in
an
alabama
case,
involved
--
which
we
have
requited
in
the
rear
at
page
29a
of
the
brief
of
the
appellees,
a
1970
alabama
statute
which
the
three-judge
court
in
alabama
with
judges
guin,
thomas
and
piedmont
(ph)
held
unconstitutional
on
the
same
grounds.
it
said,
the
legislature
was
trying
to
overturn
the
decisions
of
the
federal
court
and
under
the
supremacy
--
on
constitutional
manner
were
--
they
were
trying
to
review
the
federal
courts
decisions
about
constitutional
right
in
this
case
called
alabama
against
the
united
states
and
that
the
law
was
unconstitutional
under
the
supremacy
clause
as
well
as
under
the
green
case
and
the
brown
case.
now,
--
so
that
--
but
i
don't
think
by
making
that
argument
on
mr.
waggoner's
assumption
that
the
statute
is
just
neutral,
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
for
a
moment
that
we
accept
that
interpretation
of
the
statute.
the
real
meaning
is
the
one
that
the
attorney
general
of
north
carolina
urged
in
the
court
below
and
that
the
three-judge
court
accepted
and
that
the
statute
was
intended
to
prohibit
school
boards
from
using
this
ordinary
techniques
of
school
administration
such
as
busing,
pairing,
clustering
and
rezoning
any
of
them
if
the
purpose
was
to
affect
any
ration
on
the
basis
of
race,
any
kind
of
racial
grounds.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
the
words
of
the
statute
that
the
second
clause
of
the
first
sentence
we
were
talking
and
this--
north
carolina's
statute
is
what
i
refer
to
mr.
justice
black.
it's
at
page
21
of
our
brief
and
its
that,
no
student
shall
be
assigned
or
compelled
to
attend
any
school
on
account
of
race,
creed,
color
and
national
origin.
that
was
the
clause
we
talked
about
and
it
says
or
for
the
purpose
of
creating
a
balance
or
ration
of
race,
religion
or
national
origins.
that
was
understood,
this
is
what
the
attorney
general
and
the
court
below
accepted
as
embodying
this
limitation
on
the
power
of
the
court
to
reorganize
the
system
and
this
is
what
its
involved.
now,
the
hunter
against
erickson
point,
i
do
not
intend
to
argue
at
any
length
but
merely
to
state
the
--
and
the
point
is
simply
this,
that
the
statute
does
make
an
expressly
racial
classification.
it
says
to
a
school
board,
you
cannot
for
example
bus
children
in
order
to
racially
balance
the
schools
but
you
can
bused
them
for
any
other
purpose,
you
can
bus
children
to
segregate
them
by
sex,
you
can
bus
them
to
any
distance,
to
any
age
for
any
other
reasons
the
school
board
might
want
to
use
it
if
the
--
to
save
money
to
build
the
schools
out,
this
is
realistic,
to
build
the
schools
out
where
the
land
is
cheap
or
any
of
this
kind
of
reason
you
can
bus.
the
only
reason
you
can't
use
is
busing
for
a
--
for
racial
balance
and
in
judge
hays'
opinion,
doesn't
presuppose
any
duty
to
integrate
that
its
merely
--
even
if
--
as
he
assume,
there
was
no
duty
to
racially
balance
as
a
constitutional
manner.
there
were
the
list,
that
the
statute
disables
the
school
board
from
doing
something
that
the
black
community
is
interested
in
getting,
namely
advancing
the
cause
of
racial
integration
in
the
schools.
now,
finally,
our
definition
of
the
school
boards
duty
under
the
constitution
does
not
rest
on
a
notion
that
racial
balance
is
required.
we
state
them
--
our
view
of
the
rule
that
the
court
order
adopt
very
precisely
in
our
brief
in
the
mobile
which
--
as
the
solicitor
general
pointed
out,
we've
adopted
it
in
the
swann
case.
it
is
that
every
black
child
is
to
be
free
from
assignment
to
a
black
school
in
an
identifiable
racial
minority
school
that
every
grade
of
his
education
and
we
define
identifiable
racial
minority
schools,
not
in
terms
of
mathematics
or
percentages
or
any
precise
notion
of
a
balance
but
in
this
terms.
the
racially
identifiable
black
schools
are
those
which
by
reason
of
a
very
considerable
disproportion
or
a
very
considerable
racial
concentration
are
conceived
as
designed
to
received
black
children.
the
schools
that
are
set
aside
for
the
black
children,
is
what
we're
talking
about.
and
it
does
--
the
definition
doesn't
rest
on
anything
like
a
mathematical
precision.
we
recognize
that
a
range
of
results
or
ratios
which
satisfy
the
definition
of
a
school
not
identified
racially.
the
definition
embodies
both
the
concept
of
disproportion
which
everybody
is
familiar
in
the
debate
and
also
the
concept
of
a
considerable
racial
concentration.
on
the
idea
of
concentration
refers
to
--
at
where,
even
though
a
race
is
a
very
small
part,
they're
all
clustered
in
one
school
or
in
a
particular
school.
but
the
test
depends
in
the
final
analysis
and
you
can't
get
away
form
--
from
it
not
on
application
of
a
mathematical
rule
but
on
the
court's
exercising
judgment
about
whether
the
school
in
all
the
circumstances
is
one
which
is
conceived
as
designed
for
black
children
as
the
separate
segregated
school
set
up
as
the
institution,
the
principle
institution
of
the
segregated
system,
the
principle
vestige
of
the
segregated
system.
thank
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
main
theme
of
my
argument
is
that
the
three-judge
district
court
which
heard
this
case
below
is
correct
in
holding
that
a
portion
of
the
state
law,
two
sentences
in
it,
the
last
two
sentences
in
the
second
paragraph
were
violated
--
the
constitution
by
interfering
with
the
school
board's
duty
to
desegregate
the
schools.
that
court
held
unanimously
that
this
was
the
effect
of
the
law
as
well
as
its
purpose.
let
me
begin
by
simply
listing
the
matters,
i
hope
to
cover
in
my
allotted
time.
first,
i
would
like
to
state
a
bit
about
the
procedural
history
of
this
case
and
discuss
some
of
the
facts
about
school
busing.
the
factual
background
against
which
the
statute
is
enacted,
not
against
which
it
actually
functions
and
in
that
connection,
i
should
tell
the
court
that
in
number
498,
the
parties
have
stipulated
and
the
court
below
also
considered
that
the
entire
record
in
the
swann
case,
which
was
argued
yesterday
was
a
part
to
be
considered
in
the
three-judge
court
case.
third,
i
hope
to
discuss
briefly
the
meaning
of
the
statutory
provisions
and
the
various
interpretations
the
parties
have
given
of
it
and
fourth,
the
main
point
why
we
think
the
statute
violates
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
if
you
will
turn
your
honor
to
the
appellees'
brief
and
there's
number
498,
the
brief
for
appellees',
the
first
page
of
the
argument
which
is
--
it's
quoted
there
in
the
footnote.
see
the
footnote
number
eight.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
the
footnote
at
page
20.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
page
20.
and
the
part
that
the
court
below
held
was
unconstitutional.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
and
then
it's
the
only
part
that
we
attacked
--
was
the
last
two
sentences
in
the
second
paragraph
and
they
appear
near
--
over
on
21
and
then
continuing
in
that
footnote.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
those
two
sentences.
i
also
hope,
if
i
have
time
to
--
well,
in
connection
with
the
main
argument
about
the
statute
violating
the
equal
protection
clause,
i
think
the
--
particularly
interesting,
the
contradictory
positions
taken
by
the
parties
because
if
i
heard
them
correctly,
mr.
wagner
representing
the
school
board
stated
quite
clearly
that
he
thought
the
school
board's
plan
of
desegregation
as
the
board
has
presented
to
judge
mcmillan
defended
in
the
fourth
circuit,
defended
here
by
its
own
petition
for
certiorari
and
in
its
brief
that
the
school
board's
plan
says
mr.
wagner
violates
the
brown
case
and
it's
unconstitutional
because
he
says
it
accomplishes
too
much
desegregation.
that
is
indeed
an
amazing
turn
of
events.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
no,
but
because
of
the
technique
that
the
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
right.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
i
--
let
me
address
that
because
i
think
that
my
point
is,
that
his
position
is
inconsistent
and
i
hope
to
develop
that
in
that
part
of
my
argument.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
the
court
below
held
that
the
both
of
the
sentences
were
unconstitutional
because
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes
it
did,
i
think
so.
that
it
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
mr.
justice
black,
the
court
below
held
that
that
sentence,
the
whole
sentence
was
unconstitutional
including
that
clause
and
the
next
clause.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes
sir
i
do
because
it
interferes
with
the
school
board's
--
it
imposes
blinders
on
the
school
board.
it
says
you
cannot
consider
race
in
a
context
of
a
segregated
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
but
--
as
i
--
i
understand
that
to
be
the
argument,
however
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
mr.
justice
black,
i
understand
the
brown
case
to
hold
that
compulsory
school
segregation
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
and
that
the
statute,
the
court
below
held
in
north
carolina
where
they
still
have
school
segregation,
prevents
the
school
board
from
doing
its
duty
of
abolishing
that
discriminatory
system.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
it
tells
the
school
board
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
it
tells
the
school
board
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
the
court
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
the
court
below
didn't
understand
it
that
way
and
that's
not
the
understanding
that
the
state
court
judges
gave
it
or
that
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
we
cannot
understand
that
sentence
merely
on
the
basis
of
that
first
clause,
it
says
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
the
statute
was
on
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that's
right.
the
statute
was
specifically
designed
to
overturn
judge
mcmillan's
order
and
that's
a
history
and
it
attempts
to
do
this
by
saying
the
state
must
be
colorblind.
it
cannot
integrate
the
schools
because
it
cannot
take
into
account
race
at
all
in
assigning
students
or
in
transferring
and
that
it
cannot
do
anything
for
a
racial
purpose
in
connection
with
assigning
students.
if
you
can't,
if
you
have
as
--
and
if
you
have
an
existing
system
of
all
black
schools
and
all
white
schools,
this
statute
says
you
can't
do
anything
about
it
because
you
must
be
blind
to
the
race
of
the
students.
and
that
was
the
understanding
that
the
three
judges
below
gave
to
this
statute
and
that
was
certainly
its
intent
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
the
-
that
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
this
is
the
way
it's
been
applied
by
the
north
carolina
judges.
although
this
is
the
way
and
this
is
its
purpose,
it's
the
way
its
applied
by
the
north
carolina
judge.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
not
at
all
sir.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
may
i
say
mr.
justice
black
that
on
this
issue,
the
federal
courts
have
been
--
below
have
been
entirely
consistent
that
this
sort
of
evasion
of
brown
cannot
be
permitted
that
an
artificial
assertion
of
non-discrimination
of
trapped
cannot
be
permitted
to
stand
in
a
way
of
actually
accomplishing
a
reform
of
the
segregated
system.
all
the
federal
courts
that
have
considered
this
argument
have
rejected
it
quite
uniformly.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
and
it's
important
that
none
of
the
argument
on
the
other
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
and
that
the
statute
is
a
subterfuge
and
that's
what
judge
craven
held
and
the
court
below
held
that
it
was
a
subterfuge.
let
me
state
a
few
facts
mr.
justice
black
about
busing
and
let
me
begin
by
answering
the
question
that
you've
asked
twice
about
what
is
the
law
in
this
bus
routes.
if
you
will
turn
to
the
petitioner's
brief
in
number
281,
judge
mcmillan
made
a
specific
finding
on
this
ay
appendix
page
24
in
the
brief
in
number
281,
now
the
swann
case.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
at
the
--
page
24
of
the
appendix,
judge
mcmillan
states,
“the
longest
bus
routes
in
the
entire
county
are
the
routes
by
which
four
and
five-year
old
kindergarten
children
are
transported
to
child
development
centers.”
see,

mr.

study
of
this
subject
of
busing.

hand

exhibits

all
the

makes,
all
the
time,
judge
mcmillan's
findings
on
this
were
based
on
an
in-depth
study
of
this
busing
system
and
of
course
in
that
paragraph
there
are
descriptions
of

that

mr.

now
this
is
last

before
the
plan.
mr.
james

iii
the
--
mr.

m.

iii
that
--
that's
the
--
those
--
the
bayne
elementary
finding
which
is
ordinary
elementary
school,
the
busing
was
based
on
the
school
board's
zones
which
are
not
drawn
on
the
basis
of
proximity
but
drawn
on
the
basis
of
discretion,
but
nevertheless
they
are
the
zones.
the
school
board
decides
where
it
shapes
its
zones
for
its
own
purposes.
but
in
any
event,
this
case
has
a
complete
record
on
the
subject
of
the
busing
and
the
transportation
system
and
all
of
those
questions
can
be
answered,
the
answers
to
all
of
those
questions
can
be
ascertained
by
the
record.
let
me
state
just
a
few
general
facts
about
busing.
first
it's
wide
spread.
in
this
nation
40%
of
all
the
children
who
go
to
school
everyday
ride
school
buses,
18
million
of
them.
that's
documented
in
the
amicus
curiae
briefs,
the
ex
parte
one
by
national
education
association.
it's
also
a
finding
in
this
record.
in
north
carolina,
610,000
children
a
day,
55%
of
all
the
children
ride
school
buses
every
day.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
they
are
not
merely
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
no,
no,
no,
no.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
i
was
trying
to
state
a
few
facts
upon
--
the
background
upon
which
this
statute
is
enacted
before
i
discuss
its
application.
these
are
not
only
children
in
the
counties,
they
include
city
children.
the
way
the
law
is
applied
in
north
carolina,
the
state
up
until
last
year
paid
for
all
children
who
bused
in
the
county
areas
but
also
in
those
areas
inside
city
limits,
that
had
been
annexed
in
the
past
13
years,
any
area
annexed
since
1957
and
these
are
exhibits
i
got
out
of
the
record
room
this
morning
which
show
that
a
large
part
of
charlotte
had
been
annexed
and
these
children
are
bused
at
state
expense
in
the
red
area
and
of
course
all
those
outside
it.
in
addition,
anyone
who
travels
from
the
center
to
the
outside
is
bused
at
state
expense
and
anyone
who
travels
in
any
direction.
since
judge
mcmillan's
opinion,
the
state
has
changed
this
regulations
and
now
all
children
in
the
state
of
north
carolina
under
the
current
regulations,
no
matter
where
they
live
in,
the
city
or
the
county
are
entitled
to
busing
at
state
expenses
they
lived
more
than
a
mile
and
a
half
from
school.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
mr.
justice
black,
that
argument
is
not
necessary
to
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
it
is
--
it
has
not
been
made
because
we
don't
face
any
such
facts.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
however,
if
that
were
to
happen,
the
inquiry
would
have
to
be
whether
or
not,
it
had
a
racially
discriminatory
effect.
it
wouldn't
seem
in
neutral
circumstances
to
be
discriminatory
to
say,
“oh!
no
one
gets
a
bus
ride.”
but
just
like
the
school
closing
in
prince
edward
county,
it
might
under
some
circumstances
taking
away
busing
have
a
discriminatory
effect.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
all
this
was
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
the
state's
power
is
plenary
unless
it's
the
effect
is
to
make
a
racial
discrimination.
at
that
point
the
equal
protection
clause
would
prohibit
it
and
that
requires
an
examination
of
a
record
and
facts
and
we
don't
have
that
case
but
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that's
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
that
that
was
the
argument
that
was
made
where
the
--
in
the
griffin
case
your
honor
where
the
school
board
abolished,
they
closed
down
all
the
public
schools
in
(inaudible)
county.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
that's
the
inquiry
i'm
suggesting
would
have
to
be
made
whether
or
not
it's
discriminatory.
that's
the
only
inquiry
i'm
suggesting.
the
state's
power
is
also
plenary
in
determining
the
boundaries
of
municipalities
but
in
gomillion
against
lightfoot,
the
court
inquired
as
to
whether
or
not
that
kind
of
power
was
used
to
get
a
discriminatory
effect
to
deprive
blacks
of
the
right
to
vote.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that's
the
same
kind
of
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that
--
the
equal
protection,
that's
the
only
thing
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that's
correct.

james

10,414
elementary
children
last
year
rode
buses.
in
other
words,
42%
of
the
total
children
bused
in
charlotte
were
elementary
children
even
though
the
elementary
schools
are
ordinarily
closer
to
home
than
the
high
school.
so
the
system
was
that
we
are
dealing
with
as
busing
as
an
integral
part
of
the
normal
educational
program
for
elementary
children
as
well
as
for
high
school
children.
now,
this
record
tell
--
i
think
dispels
some
of
the
misconceptions
about
how
costly
busing
gets
to
be,
the
average
state
cost
for
a
pupil
for
a
whole
year
in
the
state
of
north
carolina
is
$23.40.
the
cost
in
charlotte-mecklenburg
is
about
the
same,
around
$20.00
to
bus
a
pupil
for
the
whole
year.
what's
involved
judge
mcmillan
found
was
a
cost
that
amounted
to
about
the
operating
expenses
of
the
school,
the
charlotte
system
for
two
days
out
of
the
year
and
that's
the
kind
of
finances
we're
dealing
with
in
relation
to
the
overall
picture.
it's
a
66
million
dollar
budget
school
system.
this
is
just
two
days
a
year
out
of
it.
the
busing
plan
that
judge
mcmillan
ordered
is
as
the
court
knows
in
effect,
judge
mcmillan
found
that
it
went
into
effect
and
the
plan
we've
been
talking
about
for
two
days
is
an
operation,
it's
functioning
this
morning,
it
has
been
for
several
weeks.
under
this
court's
denial
of
the
stay
under
the
pendente
lite
rule
of
alexander
against
holmes
county.
judge
mcmillan
found
that
the
board
had
no
need
to
make
any
additional
capital
expenditures
in
the
current
year
because
he
found
out
that
the
last
hearing
in
july,
the
board
had
in
effect
been
hiding
buses.
his
opinion
states
and
it's
--
in
that
same
opinion
that
i
referred
to
you
a
moment
ago
mr.
justice
black
at
page
18
of
the
appendix
to
petitioner's
brief
in
number
281.
this
is
the
august
3rd
memorandum,
that
the
school
board
had
in
effect
been
--
not
only
been
exaggerating
its
bus
needs
in
all
of
the
argument
but
had
led
the
court
to
believe
that
they
actually
owned
the
107
--
around
a
hundred
less
buses
than
they
had.
and
he
found
that
their
$5
million
cost
estimates
that
were
banded
on
all
over
the
nation
including
the
papers
filed
in
this
court
last
spring
were
bordered
on
fantasy
and
he
referred
it
to
alice
in
wonderland
and
i
was
there
and
we
had
again
in
july,
five
days
of
testimony
about
these
bus
estimates
and
judge
mcmillan's
finding
and
he
heard
the
witnesses
and
he
saw
these
thousands
of
names
on
paper
was
indeed
--
these
are
opinion
statements
about
the
busing
were
not
worthy
--
.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
no
sir.
the
court
of
appeals
accepted
judge
mcmillan's
findings
based
on
a
study
of
the
record.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
that's
correct
but
his
conclusion
was
that
his
original
findings
were
essentially
still
correct
based
on
all
these
new
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that's
true.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that
record
is
here
and
its
printed
and
it
was
just
filed
recently
by
the
school
board
and
it's
printed
appendix
in
number
349,
this
has
the
entire
transcript.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
and
many
of
the
exhibits
of
the
hearing.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
but
mr.
waggoner's
asserting
some
new
facts,
brand
new
facts
this
morning
about
accident
rates
and
all
that.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
entirely
correct.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
judge
mcmillan
--
no,
it
does
not.
judge
mcmillan's
finding
was
that
they
could
establish
the
needs
on
the
basis
of
actual
practice
with
the
buses
that
were
available
free
of
charge
from
the
state
board
of
education.
they'd
have
to
buy
them
next
year.
of
course,
what
one
must
understand
in
relation
to
that
is
that
the
school
board
--
that
judge
mcmillan's
findings
are
based
on
what
they
needed
to
do.
but
it's
always
been
in
the
school
board's
interest
to
exaggerate
this
and
to
devise
routes
based
on
inefficient
principles
--
and
all
that
there
estimates
based
on
running
a
less
sufficient
bus
system
than
they
were
actually
running
and
that's
why
they
got
all
those
inflated
estimates.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that's
the
judge's
finding.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
i
agree
and
what
i
want
to
talk
about
is
the
subject
to
--
next
is
the
subject
you
are
raising,
i
think
it
is
not
peripheral
because
of
the
arguments
by
the
school
board
and
the
solicitor
general
that
in
the
fourth
circuit
opinion,
the
reasonableness
doctrine
depends
on
assessing
all
of
these
factors
in
some
way
and
adding
them
up
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
certainly
and
then
judge
mcmillan
viewed
it
that
way
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
judge
mcmillan
made
all
these
detailed
findings
about
the
busing
and
the
cost
and
all
that
at
the
request
of
the
court
of
appeals
at
the
time
the
stay
was
granted.
the
court
stayed
this
order
and
said,
“give
give
us
detailed
findings
about
this.”
but
let's
talk
about
the
central
issues
in
the
statute.
the
law
prohibits
assigning
or
compelling
students
on
the
basis
of
race.
that's
the
colorblind
provision
and
also
in
the
same
purpose,
assignment
for
the
purpose
of
creating
a
balance
or
ratio
of
race.
now
the
court
below
in
its
opinion
held
that
this
wasn't
a
legislative
effort
to
limit
school
boards
to
either
freedom
of
choice
plans
and
other
part
of
the
statute
or
the
so-called
neighborhood
school
concept.
this
is
the
basis
on
which
the
attorney
general
and
the
court
below
defended
the
statute.
the
decision
below
relies
on
this.
this
is
from
the
brief
by
the
attorney
general
of
north
carolina
about
what
the
statute
means.
it
says
the
above
quoted
statute,
general
statute
115-176.1
is
really
nothing
but
the
embodiment
of
the
neighborhood
school
concept.
and
as
we
will
attempt
to
show,
the
neighborhood
school
is
legitimate
in
legal
school
facility
and
should
not
be
broken
up
or
fragmented
to
correct
racial
imbalance.
this
statute
was
designed
obviously
to
eliminate
transportation
cost
and
permit
the
student
to
remain
as
near
his
or
her
home
as
possible.
stated
another
way,
the
statute
was
designed
to
require
that
local
school
administrative
units
throughout
the
state
operate
as
nearly
as
possible
under
the
so
called
neighborhood
assignment
system.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
my
call
is
based
on
the
equal
protection
clause
and
only
that.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
the
--
i
agree
with
the
court
below.
it
says,
federal
courts
don't
sit
to
review
school
board
policies,
legislative
policies
about
how
they
allocate
their
resources.
our
argument
is
based
only
on
the
claim
that
this
statute
denies
equal
protection
of
the
laws
because
it
interferes
with
school
boards
in
carrying
out
their
obligations,
their
affirmative
duties
under
the
brown
case.
and
in
the
attorney
general's
brief
--
in
this
court
makes
a
frontal
challenge
to
green,
it
takes
a
sentence
out
of
green
where
this
court
said
there
shall
be
--
there
should
be
no
white
schools
or
black
schools,
there
should
just
be
schools.
attorney
general's
brief
here
takes
a
sentence
out
of
green
and
says
that
can
never
happen.
and
that's
pointed
out
in
our
brief
in
this
case.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
he
has
indeed
and
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
the
solicitor
general
filed
a
brief,
memorandum
of
the
united
states
as
amicus
curiae
in
444
and
498.
and
it
is
my
submission
and
he
urges
as
we
do
that
the
court
below
should
be
affirmed.
however,
it's
my
view
that
this
position
of
the
solicitor
general
in
this
case
is
entirely
inconsistent
with
the
argument
yesterday
cause
i
understood
the
solicitor
general's
argument
yesterday
to
be
that
the
choice
before
the
court
was
between
something
called
racial
balance
which
he
attributed
to
us.
and
something
that
solicitor
general
supported
which
was
called
the
neighborhood
school
assignment
system.
now,
the
holding
of
the
court
below
in
the
three-judge
court
case
is
that
this
statute
embraces,
embodies
the
neighborhood
school
assignment
system
and
yet
the
solicitor
general's
memorandum
in
the
three-judge
case
says
this,
“in
many
cases,
neither
freedom
of
choice
nor
racially
neutral
zoning
is
adequate
to
disestablish
the
former
dual
system.”
we
agree
with
that
exactly.
it
goes
on
to
the
stay.
other
steps
such
as
pairing
or
consolidating
schools,
redrawing
boundary
lines,
restructuring
transportation
routes
or
any
combination
of
these
may
be
required.
i
cannot
understand
how
someone
who
adheres
to
that
position
can
contend
that
judge
mcmillan's
decision
must
be
overturned.
i
just
don't
understand
how
the
two
arguments
fit.
i
do
understand
why
the
solicitor
general
has
to
adopt
that
view.
it's
because
this
statute
would
also
invalidate
the
hew
plan
because
the
plan
for
charlotte
developed
by
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare
embraces
the
school
boards
gerrymandered
zones
and
goes
further
with
them,
it
combines
them
into
groups
of
schools,
so
that
if
the
solicitor
general
has
not
made
the
argument
that
mr.
waggoner
made
for
the
school
board
that
is
on
plan
as
unconstitutional.
but
mr.
justice
white
in
questioning
one
of
the
counsels
asked
whether
or
not
rezoning
to
promote
integration
changing
the
lines
that
--
by
which
the
school
board
defines
what
a
school's
neighborhood
is
for
the
purpose
of
integrating
the
schools
whether
or
not
that
violates
the
statute,
and
i
understood
counsel
say
that
it
did.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
think
not.
i
think
that
is
precisely
this
lawsuit
because
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
no.
not
in
the
general
sense
but
in
the
particular
sense
that
the
--
there
is
no
escaping
the
fact
that
those
choices,
those
decisions,
those
routine
every
day
decisions
by
a
school
board
about
where
the
school
goes,
i
mean,
who
--
the
size,
the
grade
structure,
that
is
what
--
those
are
the
decisions
that
are
used
to
manipulate
these
school
systems
and
keep
them
all
black
and
all
white
so
it
is
necessary
to
look
at
those
techniques
in
order
to
stop
the
segregation,
to
stop
the
discrimination.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
i
think
the
case
does
raise
that
point
because
mr.
blakeney's
clients
went
into
the
state
superior
court
in
mecklenburg
county
and
got
an
injunction
which
restrained
the
school
board
from
carrying
out
this
kind
of
stuff.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
he
restrained
them
--
well,
let's
look
at
the
terms
of
that.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
mr.
justice
black,
that
is
why
we
submit
that
the
test
we
urge
for
--
that
the
court
order
adopt
is
a
test
based
on
results,
the
test
based
on
actually
desegregating
the
system
and
that
these
other
--
and
that
no
one
else
in
the
case,
not
the
solicitor
general,
not
the
school
board,
none
of
the
amicus
curiae
supporting
their
position
are
answering
the
questions
that
they
rhetorically
asserted
it
have
to
be
answered
as
what
is
the
unitary
system,
but
none
of
them
were
saying
how
would
--
giving
any
concrete
basis
for
instructing
a
school
superintendent
or
district
court
how
it
is,
he
runs
his
school
system
so
it
won't
be
discriminatory
and
it
can
remove
segregation.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
if
i
leave
out
the
whole
history
of
state
racial
discrimination
against
blacks
in
the
country
or
in
the
state,
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that
the
state
has
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
if
the
states
had
been
colorblind
from
the
beginning
and
we've
never
had
slavery
and
we've
never
have
racial
segregation
then
i
wouldn't
be
here.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that's
right.
but
the
essence
of
my
submission
is
to
look
at
this
statute
as
they
exist
in
the
world
we
know.
the
world
where
--
the
states
have
done
everything
they
can,
including
the
school
board
and
they
have
resisted
judge
mcmillan's
orders
and
everywhere
they
know
how
to
keep
racial
segregation
and
this
court
knows
that
history.
the
solicitor
general
referred
to
it
yesterday
in
talking
about
little
rock
and
all
that
but
i
disagree
that
it's
all
over.
this
war
against
the
brown
case
is
still
going
on,
it's
just
in
a
much
more
subtle
form
and
that's
why
we
have
to
deal
with
these
details
about
how
school
boards
run
their
systems
because
they're
not
engaging
in
more
sophisticated
types
of
evasion.
that
is
what
this
case
is
all
about.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
that's
correct
about
my
main
argument.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
it's
not
correct
about
my
other
two
arguments.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
right.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
oh,
i'm
saying
that
and
i
am
also
saying
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i'm
also
saying
--
well,
i
certainly
see
that.
but
i
also
submit
that
the
brown
case
requires
a
result.
the
brown
case
requires
an
actual
reform
of
the
school
system,
so
the
constitution
does
require
if
that
is
to
be
accomplished
in
fact
that
the
goal
be
achieved.
and
it
can
be
achieved
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
understood
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
or
maybe
i
didn't
hear
the
question.
i
understood
the
--
well,
the
answer
is
yes,
but
the
brown
case
requires
something
more
that
that's
my
only
point.
the
brown
case
requires
--
the
brown
case
held
that
the
separate
schools
for
blacks
were
inherently
unequal
and
had
to
be
abolished
as
--
and
it
was
not
simply
a
decision
based
on
the
existence
of
a
racial
classification.
now,
this
neighborhood
school
concept
in
the
context
of
a
system
like
charlotte
insofar
as
i've
been
able
to
tell
in
the
context
of
all
the
school
segregation
cases
in
the
courts
now
a
days.
this
neighborhood
school
concept
is
really
a
fiction.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
a
fiction.
it
certainly
never
existed
in
charlotte.
no
one
in
this
case
in
charlotte,
certainly
not
the
school
board,
not
the
hew
plan
that
the
united
states
presented
is
proposing
that
pupils
be
assigned
on
the
simple
basis
that
mr.
vanore
stated,
that
is,
“no
one
has
proposed
that
the
assigned
pupils
in
charlotte
schools
to
the
closest
school
that
can
hold
them
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
would
think
that
on
the
facts
of
charlotte
it's
unconstitutional.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
have
nothing
against
that
policy
and
that
policy
is
not
per
se
unconstitutional.
but
it
does
produce
an
unconstitutional
result
where
the
neighborhoods
are
racially
defined
by
the
state
as
in
charlotte
or
where
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
they
accomplished
precisely
that
by
a
series
of
administrative
steps
in
the
small
decisions,
precisely
then
they
defined
the
neighborhood
racially
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
why?
this
has
really
two
aspects.
yes,
the
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
there
is
no
law
applicable
to
charlotte.
no
racial
segregation
ordinance
applicable
to
charlotte.
but
the
same
thing
has
been
accomplished
in
charlotte
by
the
use
of
the
--
whole
record
we
made
on
the
zoning,
on
the
way
that
the
black
neighborhoods
were
treated
differently
in
the
zoning,
on
the
way
the
public
housing
was
built,
the
government
and
the
way
the
urban
renewal
moved
the
people
around.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
judgment
--
judge
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
think
the
choice
is
that
we
--
judge
mcmillan
made
a
finding
that
that's
what
has
been
going
on
in
charlotte
so
that
the
choice
is,
the
choice
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that
the
government
had
been
accomplishing
residential
segregation
by
these
several
methods
in
charlotte.
so
that
the
choice
that
gives
us
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
we
don't
seek
to.
we
seek
to
integrate
the
schools
on
the
simple
thesis
that
schools,
their
residents
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
the
school
board
is
not
proposing
to
give
them
schools
in
their
areas
and
they
never
have.
so
that's
not
the
decision
that
i
have
made
or
that
the
plaintiffs
in
the
case
have
made
but
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
mr.
justice
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
i
don't
describe
my
position
that
way.
no
sir,
let's
take
a
concrete
example
of
--
let's
look
at
an
example
of
what
judge
mcmillan
was
faced
with.
he's
faced
with
something
that
--
on
this
piece
of
cardboard
which
we
showed
you
yesterday,
we
just
simply
made
tracings
of
a
proposal
about
how
you
treat
the
pupils
in
this
particular
area
and
the
red
outline
is
the
government's
proposal
for
this
particular
area
and
the
black
outline
is
the
one
judge
mcmillan
ordered
and
let
me
take
it
very
specifically
in
an
effort
to
show
you
not
that
something
particular
wrong
with
this
--
not
that
somebody
made
a
mistake
about
this
particular
thing
but
an
effort
to
illustrate
the
principle
that
there
really
is
no
difference
between
this
racial
balanced
idea
that
we
are
charged
with
and
then
neighborhood
school
idea
that
the
others
say,
they
are
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
this
is
the
hew
neighborhood
school.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
oh!
yes.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
understand
that.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
agree
with
them
mr.
justice
white.
i
quote
the
hew
neighborhood,
the
hew
neighborhood
plan.
so,
it's
what
it
does.
the
one
that
the
solicitor
general
supports.
there's
a
black
school
here,
down
at
this
part
i'm
pointing
to
is
called
lincoln
heights
and
there's
a
white
school
here
that
is
called
dorieta
(ph)
and
there's
a
white
school
here
called
statesville
road
and
all
three
of
them
have
grades
one
through
six
last
year.
the
school
board
constructed
some
zone
lines
in
there,
proposed
the
integration
plan.
it
left
lincoln
heights,
a
100%
black.
so
the
hew
proposed
to
cure
that
by
combining
all
three
into
one
big
school
zone,
combining
all
three
in
to
one
big
school
zone
and
saying
that
children
in
the
first
two
grades
will
go
to
dorieta
(ph)
over
here,
children
in
grades
three
and
four
will
go
to
statesville
road
and
the
children
in
grades
five
and
six,
even
those
white
children
that
were
here
go
to
the
black
school
in
the
ghetto
in
grades
five
and
six,
alright?
now,
that
is
defended
as
neighborhood
schools
and
this
is
a
particularly
large
and
non-compact
example
of
this
but
this
is
neighborhood
schools,
hew
style.
now,
the
black
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
school
board
opposes
this.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
but
you
can
--
i'm
not
trying
to
advocate
this
particular
zone.
i'm
tying
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes,
yes
your
honor.
the
brief
of
the
united
states
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
the
solicitor
general's
submission
to
be
accurate
about
it
is
that
the
case
ought
to
be
remanded
and
judge
mcmillan
should
understand
the
correct
legal
principle
that
that
is
a
valid
plan
and
the
school
board
ought
to
be
permitted
that
choice.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
this
really
isn't
just
--
this
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
let
me
be
clear.
this
is
very
much
representative
of
what
the
united
states
government
is
requiring
all
over
the
south
because
their
principle
is,
the
only
way
you
integrate,
its
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
the
only
way
you
integrate
is
you
combine
--
is
you
rezone
or
you
combine
contiguous
zones.
he
has
the
three
methods
listed
their
in
his
brief,
its
combining
contiguous
zones
and
our
point
is
that
from
the
stand
point
of
the
actual
practical
operations
of
the
school
system
of
the
actual
practical
effect
on
the
child,
this
principle
of
contiguity
doesn't
have
any
meaning.
it's
the
same
to
the
child
whether
he's
bused
across
this
intervening
area
or
that
you
can
draw
a
big
line
around
it
and
he
is
bused
the
same
distance.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
what
i
would
suggest
is
that
judge
mcmillan
said
it
precisely
right
when
he
said
that
the
neighborhood
school
concept
whatever
may
be
its
value
has
no
standing
in
the
constitution
to
overwrite
the
constitutional
duty
of
the
school
board.
it
has
no
standing
to
block
the
board
from
performing
its
affirmative
duty
to
change
the
unitary
system.
if
you
assume
that
--
if
you
assume
mr.
justice
black
that
the
neighborhoods
are
really
natural
and
the
people
are
voluntarily
moved
there
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
--
you
still
have
say
--
no
they're
not.
none
on
these
findings
but
you
still
--
even
if
you
make
that
assumption
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
no,
that
the
neighborhoods
are
racial.
that
the
neighborhood's
--
well,
that
saying
neighborhood
system
is
the
same
as
saying
racial
system.
it's
not
the
same
as
saying
non-racial
and
neutral
system,
that
is
the
finding.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
and
that
is
basically
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
mr.
justice
black,
if
we
had
ever
seen
in
any
of
these
cases
a
real
neighborhood
system
based
on
every
child
going
to
the
closest
school
system,
and
“to
the
closest
school”
then
we
might
say
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
is
upsetting
some
established
practice.
but
we
don't
have
that
in
charlotte.
they've
never
had
that
in
mobile.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
it
certainly
happens
that
sometimes
pupils
attend
the
closest
school
but
these
city
school
systems
are
not
operated
on
any
kind
of
basis
of
strict
proximity
that
when
you
got
a
103
schools
like
charlotte
has,
if
it's
--
that
--
they're
not
just
wrong
that
way.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
no,
your
honor,
not
at
all.
i
take
it
by
that,
that
you
mean
do
--
you
mean
state
actually
refers
to
housing?
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
no,
no.
the
housing
discrimination.
we
have
no
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes,
i
would
provided
i
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
but
i
--
but
its
because
its
not
only
the
housing
practices
that
are
racial,
the
school
assignment
practice
has
it
been
racial
ever
since
brown.
it's
the
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
the
--
your
observation
is
entirely
correct
that
that
is
not
essential
to
that.
that
judge
mcmillan
didn't
regard
it
as
essential
to
his
decision
and
we
don't
believe
it
so
because
the
school
assignment
practices
are
--
the
dual
zones
are
using
busing
to
keep
the
school
segregated.
busing
children
passed
their
nearest
school
to
keep
them
segregated.
all
of
those
practices
are
--
that
--
mr.
justice
black
there
is
an
exhibit
in
the
opinion
by
judge
mcmillan
at
page
1206a
of
this
third
volume
of
281
which
list
the
nine
schools
that
the
school
board
would
leave
all
black.
and
all
of
them
but
one,
were
either
built
since
brown
or
had
additions
put
on
them
since
brown,
or
enlarged
or
improved.
so
that
--
what
we're
looking
at
is
institutions
constructed
on
all
black
segregated
basis
since
brown
when
judge
mcmillan
has
dealing
with
the
reality
of
life
in
a
community
where
the
school
board
has
been
engaging
in
all
of
these
chicanery
to
keep
school
board
--
the
school
segregated
and
it's
his
job
to
find
a
remedy
for
that
and
we
suggest
that
the
only
administrable
principle
is
not
some
--
you'll
never
get
the
schools
integrated.
if
you
tell
a
district
judge
as
to
go
--
develop
a
reasonable
plans
or
operate
on
one
of
this
verbal
formulations
that
is
based
on
something
other
than
doing
the
job.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well.
judge
mcmillan
proceeded
and
precisely
that
kind
of
common
law
--
this
tradition.
he
said
he
was
deciding
this
case
on
its
facts
and
on
charlotte.
he
wasn't
trying
to
make
law
for
the
whole
country.
he
was
deciding
a
case
on
the
record
beforehand.
it
is
a
detailed
the
record.
it
is
the
--
i'm
sure
the
most
detailed
record
on
the
subject
of
busing
that
in
relation
to
school
desegregation
that's
ever
been
made
and
then
the
suggestion
that
three
ought
to
have
a
remand
for
some
further
proceedings
it
seems
to
me
is
a
suggestion
that
not
that
the
court
clarify
the
law
for
the
guidance
of
the
school
board
but
a
suggestion
that
we
have
more
confusion
and
more
lack
of
clarity.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
no,
that
was
the
question
i
thought
i
answered
for
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
said
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
its
not
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
its
because
the
court's
traditional
approached
to
this
problem
as
state
actions
is
to
look
at
the
whole
factual
pattern
and
then
in
all
the
background
path
and
we
don't
rely
on
anyone
factor
and
we
certainly
don't
rely
on
anyone
novel
a
--
for
a
state
action
approach
where
we've
got
all
these
conventional
state
action
namely,
school's
run
on
a
compulsory
segregated
basis
right
up
until
july
1969,
the
school
system
ran
with
25
black
schools.
two
thirds
of
the
children
on
a
freedom
or
transfer
plan
just
like
that
in
the
ray
case,
the
monroe
case
from
jackson,
tennessee,
that
was
a
companion
of
green.
the
--
so
that
the
--
there's
so
much
conventional
state
action.
we
don't
have
to
deal
with
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
why
--
certainly
he
thought
it
had
some
bearing
on
the
matter,
i
mean,
and
i
think
that
is
correct
but
i
do
not
believe
its
correct
to
say
that
the
decision
hinges
on
it
or
that
it
depends
on
it.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
but
let
me
--
if
i
may
take
an
example,
i
mean,
of
the
relevance
of
this
kind
of
evidence,
to
the
concrete
one.
the
two
schools
that
hew
were
going
leave
black
were
oakland
and
double
oak.
double
oaks
school
is
a
school
built
right
in
the
midst
of
a
low
income
federal
housing
project.
that's
the
most
dejure
neighborhood
in
town.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
and
the
suggestion
that
--
that
that's
the
school
to
be
left
all
black
seems
to
me
contradicts
the
brown
decision.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
appreciate
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
use
an
additional
ten
minutes
if
the
court
will
allow.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
to
--
just
merely
to
state
two
additional
arguments
which
are
made
in
our
brief
and
in
the
process
i
think
add
to
my
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question
which
suppose
that
this
statute
was
adopted
in
an
entirely
neutral
atmosphere,
perhaps
hundreds
of
years
ago
outside
any
context
of
--
a
history
of
segregation
and
so
forth.
the
first
of
the
two
arguments
is
the
one
we
set
out
in
our
brief
in
which
the
court
below
relied
on
based
on
the
supremacy
clause.
now
that
argument
of
course
would
not
apply
to
this
hypothetical
statute
adopted
in
another
environment.
the
second
argument
i
will
make
based
on
the
principle
decided
in
hunter
against
erickson
and
the
lucid
opinion
by
judge
paul
hays
last
week
involving
the
new
york
statute
might
apply
in
that
other
situation
and
i'm
talking
about
that.
and
i'd
like
to
conclude
by
returning
to
what
we
mean
by
racially
identifiable
school.
now,
the
supremacy
clause
issue
is
i
think
quite
simple
and
quite
fundamental.
it
is
that
the
statute
constitutes
a
practical
interference
with
the
remedial
powers
of
the
district
judge.
even
if
we
accept
mr.
waggoner's
interpretation
of
what
the
statute
means,
that
is
true.
mr.
waggoner
says
that
the
statute
only
applies
after
you
have
a
unitary
system
and
then
when
you
do,
you
can
no
longer
use
race.
and
that
the
statute
forbids
--
thus
prohibits
the
school
board
from
using
race
to
go
beyond
the
requirements
of
brown.
you
can
go
up
to
the
requirements
of
brown
but
not
beyond
it.
and
practically
what
does
that
do?
what
did
it
do
in
this
case?
it
put
the
school
board
in
the
position
of
having
a
federal
judge
who
would
enjoin
them
to
come
up
to
the
requirements
of
brown
do
the
minimum
--
to
do
at
least
the
minimum
necessary
to
comply
with
brown.
and
a
state
judge
who
would
enjoin
them
and
that
you
can't
take
a
one
step
beyond
it,
that
you
can't
go
one
inch
beyond
the
minimum
federal
constitutional
requirements.
now,
the
statute
is
overbroad
in
general
and
vague
as
this
is
--
which
sets
up
that
kind
of
collision
between
the
federal
power
and
the
state
judge's
power.
it
is
a
practical
interference
with
the
remedial
files
of
the
federal
courts
as
the
courts
below
erred.
and
the
same
thing
was
found
in
an
alabama
case,
involved
--
which
we
have
requited
in
the
rear
at
page
29a
of
the
brief
of
the
appellees,
a
1970
alabama
statute
which
the
three-judge
court
in
alabama
with
judges
guin,
thomas
and
piedmont
(ph)
held
unconstitutional
on
the
same
grounds.
it
said,
the
legislature
was
trying
to
overturn
the
decisions
of
the
federal
court
and
under
the
supremacy
--
on
constitutional
manner
were
--
they
were
trying
to
review
the
federal
courts
decisions
about
constitutional
right
in
this
case
called
alabama
against
the
united
states
and
that
the
law
was
unconstitutional
under
the
supremacy
clause
as
well
as
under
the
green
case
and
the
brown
case.
now,
--
so
that
--
but
i
don't
think
by
making
that
argument
on
mr.
waggoner's
assumption
that
the
statute
is
just
neutral,
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
for
a
moment
that
we
accept
that
interpretation
of
the
statute.
the
real
meaning
is
the
one
that
the
attorney
general
of
north
carolina
urged
in
the
court
below
and
that
the
three-judge
court
accepted
and
that
the
statute
was
intended
to
prohibit
school
boards
from
using
this
ordinary
techniques
of
school
administration
such
as
busing,
pairing,
clustering
and
rezoning
any
of
them
if
the
purpose
was
to
affect
any
ration
on
the
basis
of
race,
any
kind
of
racial
grounds.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
the
words
of
the
statute
that
the
second
clause
of
the
first
sentence
we
were
talking
and
this--
north
carolina's
statute
is
what
i
refer
to
mr.
justice
black.
it's
at
page
21
of
our
brief
and
its
that,
no
student
shall
be
assigned
or
compelled
to
attend
any
school
on
account
of
race,
creed,
color
and
national
origin.
that
was
the
clause
we
talked
about
and
it
says
or
for
the
purpose
of
creating
a
balance
or
ration
of
race,
religion
or
national
origins.
that
was
understood,
this
is
what
the
attorney
general
and
the
court
below
accepted
as
embodying
this
limitation
on
the
power
of
the
court
to
reorganize
the
system
and
this
is
what
its
involved.
now,
the
hunter
against
erickson
point,
i
do
not
intend
to
argue
at
any
length
but
merely
to
state
the
--
and
the
point
is
simply
this,
that
the
statute
does
make
an
expressly
racial
classification.
it
says
to
a
school
board,
you
cannot
for
example
bus
children
in
order
to
racially
balance
the
schools
but
you
can
bused
them
for
any
other
purpose,
you
can
bus
children
to
segregate
them
by
sex,
you
can
bus
them
to
any
distance,
to
any
age
for
any
other
reasons
the
school
board
might
want
to
use
it
if
the
--
to
save
money
to
build
the
schools
out,
this
is
realistic,
to
build
the
schools
out
where
the
land
is
cheap
or
any
of
this
kind
of
reason
you
can
bus.
the
only
reason
you
can't
use
is
busing
for
a
--
for
racial
balance
and
in
judge
hays'
opinion,
doesn't
presuppose
any
duty
to
integrate
that
its
merely
--
even
if
--
as
he
assume,
there
was
no
duty
to
racially
balance
as
a
constitutional
manner.
there
were
the
list,
that
the
statute
disables
the
school
board
from
doing
something
that
the
black
community
is
interested
in
getting,
namely
advancing
the
cause
of
racial
integration
in
the
schools.
now,
finally,
our
definition
of
the
school
boards
duty
under
the
constitution
does
not
rest
on
a
notion
that
racial
balance
is
required.
we
state
them
--
our
view
of
the
rule
that
the
court
order
adopt
very
precisely
in
our
brief
in
the
mobile
which
--
as
the
solicitor
general
pointed
out,
we've
adopted
it
in
the
swann
case.
it
is
that
every
black
child
is
to
be
free
from
assignment
to
a
black
school
in
an
identifiable
racial
minority
school
that
every
grade
of
his
education
and
we
define
identifiable
racial
minority
schools,
not
in
terms
of
mathematics
or
percentages
or
any
precise
notion
of
a
balance
but
in
this
terms.
the
racially
identifiable
black
schools
are
those
which
by
reason
of
a
very
considerable
disproportion
or
a
very
considerable
racial
concentration
are
conceived
as
designed
to
received
black
children.
the
schools
that
are
set
aside
for
the
black
children,
is
what
we're
talking
about.
and
it
does
--
the
definition
doesn't
rest
on
anything
like
a
mathematical
precision.
we
recognize
that
a
range
of
results
or
ratios
which
satisfy
the
definition
of
a
school
not
identified
racially.
the
definition
embodies
both
the
concept
of
disproportion
which
everybody
is
familiar
in
the
debate
and
also
the
concept
of
a
considerable
racial
concentration.
on
the
idea
of
concentration
refers
to
--
at
where,
even
though
a
race
is
a
very
small
part,
they're
all
clustered
in
one
school
or
in
a
particular
school.
but
the
test
depends
in
the
final
analysis
and
you
can't
get
away
form
--
from
it
not
on
application
of
a
mathematical
rule
but
on
the
court's
exercising
judgment
about
whether
the
school
in
all
the
circumstances
is
one
which
is
conceived
as
designed
for
black
children
as
the
separate
segregated
school
set
up
as
the
institution,
the
principle
institution
of
the
segregated
system,
the
principle
vestige
of
the
segregated
system.
thank
mr.
chief
justice.
