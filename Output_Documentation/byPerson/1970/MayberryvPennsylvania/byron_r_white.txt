what's
your
view
in
the
offenses
towards
this
court?
justice

now,
how
are
we
really
supposed
to
if
these
facts
are
relevant
to
that
judgment,
how
are
we
supposed
to
get
them
before
us
when
they
aren’t
in
the
record?
justice

the
habeas
corpus?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
he
has
a
state
post
conviction,
miss
los.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
it
would
have
to
go
there
to
the
federal
habeas
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
suppose
the
purpose
of
giving
these
contempt
sentences
was?
certainly,
it
wasn’t
in
control
of
the
trial,
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it
to
deter
mayberry?
whenever
doing
anything
like
this
again,
i
don’t
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
shouldn’t,
miss
los
or
do
you
think
it’s
at
least
bit
of
sensible
to
suggest
that
if
a
judge
thinks
that
an
act
in
the
courtroom
is
so
serous
that
it
justifies
the
two-year
sentence
that
he
must
not
try
it
himself,
that
he
is
going
to
wait
until
after
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
would
you
know
that
whenever
--
isn’t
it
the
rule
that
when
it
appears
that
a
judge
is
so
personally
involved
and
so
insulted
by
contemptuous
act
that
he
shouldn’t
be
the
one
to
try
the
contempt?
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
clear.
somebody's
statements
were
pretty
personal
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
when
a
judge
reacts
so
strongly
to
having
a
personal
remark
directed
at
them
that
he
gives
a
man
two
years
for
it?
