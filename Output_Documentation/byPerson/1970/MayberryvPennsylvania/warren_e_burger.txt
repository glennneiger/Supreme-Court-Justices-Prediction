chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
number
121,
mayberry
against
pennsylvania,
is
the
counsel
ready?
mr.
reitz
can
you
conveniently,
do
you
think
without
discommoding
yourself,
present
a
section
of
your
argument
now
in
about
seven
minutes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
we
recess.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
clarify
for
me
if
you
will
mr.
reitz
the
relationship
of
these
sentences
collectively
to
the
sentence
on
the
substantive
charge.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
is
that
consecutive?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
say
that
their
conduct
was
as
aggravated
as
it
was
with
respect
to
this
petitioner?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it,
if
you
would
agree
that
these
were
very
aggravated
episodes
of
the
conduct
and
utterance,
would
you
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
after
repeated,
you
wouldn’t
concede
this
was
aggravated?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
we’ll
suspend
here,
mr.
reitz.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
was
it
basically
any
different
from
the
procedural
due
process
that
he
had
in
the
trial
of
the
substantive
charges?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
what
he
had
done
about
counsel
in
the
substantive
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
although
from
that,
is
that
he
rejected
affirmatively
permanently,
didn’t
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
may
i
ask
this
professor
reitz.
is
it
your
submission
that
the
real
vice
here
is
the
proportion
in
terms
of
procedure
or
the
disproportion
in
terms
of
panoply?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wouldn’t
that
have
been
somewhat
ceremonial
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
the
conduct
or
the
sentence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
could
you
mitigate
the
conduct?
what
explanation
could
possibly,
even
approach
justification?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
that
meant
that
the
trial
judge
simply
was
taking
position
that
there
was
no
evidence
that
could
bear
by
way
of
litigation
or
explanation
of
his
conduct
during
the
course
of
the
trial.
i
suppose
if
the
trial
judge
had
the
benefit
of
illinois
against
allen
at
that
time,
he
might
well
have
removed
this
man
from
the
courtroom,
after
his
second
outburst,
but
of
course
this
was
tried
on
before
illinois
against
allen
was
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
i
wonder
if
our
real
problem
in
this
case
isn’t
the
severity
of
the
sanctions
and
frankly
that’s
the
way
it
seemed
to
me
and
i
refer
to
that
on
that
theory
and
then
i
maybe
i've
diverted
from
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
decided
you
were
right
on
the
constitutional
argument,
but
what
could
be
the
mechanism
to
deal
with
it,
undertake
to
deal
it
with
ourselves
or
to
remand
it
for
reconsideration
in
a
calmer
atmosphere?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
aren’t
state
courts
capable
of
applying
the
federal
constitutional
provision
or
provisions
that
you
rely
on.
what
is
different
about
their
approach?
i'm
not
speaking
of
the
instant
case
in
terms
of
the
action.
i'm
speaking
of
establishing
standards.
shouldn’t
they
be
established
in
the
state
courts
in
the
first
instance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
professor
reitz,
didn’t
justice
o’brien
assume
in
his
separate
opinion
that
there
was
something
in
the
nature
of
supervisory
power
that
imposed
the
duty
on
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
to
examine
the
sentence
for
the
contempt?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
judge
had
made
all
these
sentences
concurrent
one
with
another,
there
were
11,
weren’t
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
it
made
him
concurrent,
would
you
be
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
two
years
on
each,
was
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
do
you
draw
the
line?
would
you
undertake
to
draw
line?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
within
the
22
years?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
just
test
it
for
size,
suppose
you
gave
him
60
days
on
first
offensive
conduct,
would
you
think
that
was
acceptable?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then,
when
it
is
repeated
he
gave
him
another
60
days
and
continued
that
right
through
then
he
would
have
what
--
22
months
wouldn’t
he?
would
you
be
here
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
but
then
let’s
stop.
let’s
go
back.
the
first
misconduct
occurs
after
the
jury
has
left
the
room
for
the
day.
he
calls
him
in
and
sentences
him
to
60
days
for
that
offensive
conduct
and
you
concede,
no
other
process
necessary,
i
take
it.
now
two
days
later,
he
repeats
that
and
the
judge
repeats
the
same
process.
you
mean
that
after
the
first
few
bites,
they're
all
free?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you,
you
wouldn’t?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
jury
trial
for
60
days
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
problem
in
illinois
against
allen
power
of
contempt
was
specifically
reserved
in
justice
black’s
opinion.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
unless
it
were
three
days?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
our
reservation
before
was
that
if
it
were
three
days,
you
would
think
that
was
alright?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
miss
los.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
talk
about
a
complete
hearing,
are
you
suggesting
that
this
be
a
complete
hearing
in
a
due
process
sense
of
a
trial
with
the
jury
before
it
could
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
we
remand
as
you
intimated
might
be
one
solution,
is
the
case
going
to
be
tried
under
1966
standards
or
1971
standards?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
miss
los.
i
think
your
time
is
consumed
professor
reitz,
unless
you
have
something
to
consider
with
high
urgency
and
we’ll
give
you
a
little
bit
of
time
for
that.
chief

e.

at
