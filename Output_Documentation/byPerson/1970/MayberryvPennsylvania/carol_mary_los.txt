ms.
carol
mary
los
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
were
originally
of
the
opinion
that
the
entire
trial
transcript
should
be
printed
in
the
appendix
for
the
court
because
we
felt
that
only
by
reading
the
entire
trial
transcript
could
this
court
get
some
idea
of
the
feelings,
and
the
tensions,
and
the
pressures
that
existed
throughout
this
long
five
week
trial.
unfortunately,
going
through
the
trial
transcript
we
realized
that
by
the
court's
stenographer
merely
really
taking
down
the
words
that
happened
that
so
much
missed
the
court’s
stenographer
or
could
not
be
taken
down
simply
in
the
method
of
words
that
this
court
could
not
feel
simply
from
a
cold
record,
the
tensions,
and
the
pressures
that
existed
that
day
or
the
response
that
the
petitioner
was
able
to
evoke,
not
only
from
his
co-defendants
or
from
the
jury,
but
from
the
spectators
who
were
in
the
courtroom
at
the
time.
apparently,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
petitioner
might
be
able
to
take
advantage
of
this
cold
record
in
denying,
first
of
all,
that
he
is
an
extremely
intelligent
and
articulate
man.
and
secondly,
that
he
was
not
the
ring
leader
or
the
instigator
of
all
of
these
contempts.
if
i
may
just
for
a
few
moments
to
recap
some
of
the
events
of
the
trial
that
might
not
necessarily
be
printed
in
the
trial
record.
this
was
the
second
trial
that
had
begun
in
these
charges.
the
first
ended
in
the
mistrial
when
the
petitioner
alleged
that
a
prospective
juror
had
seen
him
handcuffed
to
a
sheriff,
a
mistrial
was
granted
and
the
petitioner
boasted
at
this
time
that
he
would
never
be
brought
to
trial
in
these
charges,
that
if
all
those
failed,
he
would
break
out
of
jail.
he
threatened
the
prosecutor
and
stated
that
prosecutor
would
never
see
him
from
the
trial
in
these
charges
for
prison
breach.
these
weren’t
idle
threats.
mayberry
had
previously
broken
out
of
the
eastern
penitentiary
in
pennsylvania,
the
western
penitentiary
in
pennsylvania,
the
graterford
prison
he
attempted
a
prison
breach
and
during
the
course
of
this
trial,
he
was
able
to
break
out
at
the
allegany
county
jail.
this
prison
breach
occurred
almost
in
the
middle
of
this
particular
trial.
at
the
time
it
occurred
on
a
weekend,
the
petitioner
and
his
two
co-defendants
as
well
as
three
other
inmates
of
the
allegany
county
jail
broke
out,
kidnapped
the
city
police
officer,
who
was
on
duty
at
that
time
and
were
able
to
get
a
good
distance
from
the
city
before
they
were
captured.
it
was
only
because
the
gun
that
they
had
secured
from
the
police
officer
misfired
that
a
police
officer
was
not
killed
at
close
range.
as
i
say,
this
occurred
during
the
course
of
a
trial
and
does
not
necessarily
appear
as
the
matter
of
record.
but
in
any
event,
petitioner
from
the
start
was
deemed
to
be
a
very
dangerous
individual.
the
courtroom,
understandably
contained
the
great
number
of
sheriff’s
deputies.
trial
began
before
judge
fiok
and
mayberry
as
has
been
set
forth
before
decided
that
he
wanted
to
act
as
his
own
counsel
and
refused
the
help
of
counsel
that
was
appointed
for
him.
counsel,
nonetheless
appeared
throughout
the
trial
and
was
there
at
the
sentencing
for
the
contempt
citations.
mayberry
requested
from
the
trial
judge
that
he
permitted
to
come
to
sidebar,
whenever
he
wished,
the
trial
judge
refused
this.
first
of
all,
i
believe
that
because
mayberry
was
a
very
dangerous
individual
and
a
search
of
mayberry’s
legal
papers
during
the
trial
revealed
that
he
had
placed
sharpened
razor
blades
inside
of
his
legal
pad.
secondly,
one
of
the
co-defendants
had
been
throwing
pencils
at
the
judge,
during
the
trial.
so
i
mean,
there’s
a
certainly
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
the
judge
himself
might
have
feared
that
his
life
was
in
danger.
there
was
a
bodyguard
especially
assigned
to
the
prosecutor
after
the
threats
and
the
petitioner
became
so
numerous
across
the
counsel
table.
these
again
are
not
recorded
in
the
trial
transcript
because
the
court
stenographer
was
not
within
the
hearing
range.
nonetheless,
the
request
for
sidebar
was
refused.
mayberry
started
a
series
of
taunts
to
the
judge
which
continued
throughout
the
trial.
his
attitude
was
this,
“i
want
an
explanation
that
satisfies
me
right
now
and
if
i
don’t
get
it,
i'm
not
going
to
continue
with
this
trial.”
for
example,
a
very
good
example
i
think
occurs
at
the
end
of
trial
when
he
closes
to
the
jury.
he
is
told
that
he
will
only
be
permitted
an
hour
to
close.
the
end
of
the
hour,
he
is
given
an
additional
15
minutes,
mayberry
decides
that
he
wants
just
to
continue
his
closing
to
the
jury.
when
he
refuses
to
hear
the
judge’s
warnings,
he
is
taken
out
of
the
courtroom
and
another
co-defendant
is
permitted
to
close.
when
mayberry
is
brought
back
in
again,
he
gets
off
and
starts
closing
to
the
jury
again,
he’s
again
taken
out
of
the
room.
so
that
the
trial
judge
attempted
on
several
occasions,
various
different
methods,
he
had
him
taken
out
of
the
room
at
least
10
or
11
times.
when
brought
back,
mayberry
proceeded
the
same
way
as
when
he
had
left
off,
when
he
was
taken
out
of
the
room.
he
was
bound
and
gagged.
but
unfortunately,
he
was
able
to
shout
through
the
gag
and
pound
on
the
floor.
his
shoes
and
the
shoes
of
his
co-defendants
were
removed.
he
still
raised
such
a
ruckus
that
the
trial
judge
was
unable
to
charge
to
the
jury.
now,
when
mayberry
would
direct
one
of
his
assaults
to
the
trial
judge,
petitioner’s
brief
would
have
you
believed
that
nothing
merely
happen
except
the
judge
said,
“continue
on
with
your
questioning.”
what
happened
precisely
was
this,
mayberry
was
greatly
amused
by
the
fact
that
there
were
loud
gossips
in
the
courtroom
that
the
jury
was
shocked
that
some
of
the
spectators
were
shocked.
he
would
burst
out
into
this
loud
laughter
which
was
followed
by
his
co-defendant,
who
would
hoot
and
howl,
and
applaud,
and
stamp
their
feet.
and
in
fact,
the
reason
we
say
that
mayberry
was
the
ring
leader
here
was
that
when
he
would
return
to
his
seat,
he
would
lean
across
to
the
prosecutor
and
say,
“now,
watch
this.”
and
would
stand
up
and
repeat
something.
ms.
carol
mary
los
yes,
they
were
your
honor.
ms.
carol
mary
los
yes,
there
were.
what
mayberry
did
was
he
would
lean
to
them
and
say,
“now,
it’s
your
turn”,
or
after
he
would
repeat
something,
if
one
of
the
men
wouldn’t
get
up,
he’d
give
him
a
nudge
inside
and
the
co-defendant
would
spring
up
and
direct
some
abuse
to
the
judge.
ms.
carol
mary
los
all
three
of
them
were,
your
honor.
yes.
ms.
carol
mary
los
they
did
not
take
the
cases
on
appeal.
ms.
carol
mary
los
that
is
true.
ms.
carol
mary
los
they
got
one
to
two
year
sentences
precisely
as
mayberry
had.
only
they
were
not
cited
for
contempt
as
many
times.
i
believe
one
was
cited
six
times
and
the
other
was
cited
for
seven
different
occasions
during
the
trial.
ms.
carol
mary
los
i
believe
that
is
true.
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
carol
mary
los
i
do
not
believe
that
there
was
an
appeal
taken.
at
least,
not
to
my
knowledge.
ms.
carol
mary
los
no.
i
was
not
at
the
trial
but
i
had
the
benefit
of
talking
with
the
prosecutor
on
numerous
occasions
and
again,
i
was
in
the
law
school
at
the
time
of
this
trial.
but
there
was
a
great
deal
of
publicity
and
in
fact,
that
this
was
a
case
of
some
notoriety
at
the
time.
ms.
carol
mary
los
yes,
your
honor.
this
is
in
pittsburgh
in
allegany
county.
incidentally,
after
mayberry
would
nudge
one
of
his
co-defendants
and
asked
them
to
indicating
to
them
to
stand
up
and
raise
some
ruckus.
he
would
then
after
they
had
addressed
something
too
rude
to
the
trial
judge,
he
would
stand
up
and
ask
for
a
mistrial
and
when
that
was
denied,
he
would
ask
for
severance
on
the
grounds
that
he
was
prejudiced
in
front
of
the
jury
about
what
his
co-defendants
had
said.
there
was
also
in
the
back
of
the
courtroom,
a
small
group
of
men
who
were
later
identified
as
being
inmates,
who
were
either
out
on
bond,
who
were
released
from
prison,
who
were
known
to
mayberry.
and
after
he
would
direct
something
to
the
judge,
he
would
turn
around
in
laughing
manner
toward
them,
they
would
again
applaud
and
would
stamp
their
feet
and
so
it’s
to
create
such
a
disturbance
--
ms.
carol
mary
los
oh,
no
your
honor.
they
were
removed
from
the
courtroom.
but
what
--
i
am
saying
is
that
the
purpose
of
his
remarks
to
the
judge
were
not
just
to
excoriate
the
judge,
the
purpose
was
to
create
sufficient
ruckus
so
that
there
would
be
delay
in
the
trial.
ms.
carol
mary
los
i
am
not
aware
of
any
i
know
that
of
course
that
none
in
the
interim
period
has
passed.
i
cannot
say
with
any
certainty
that
there
has
been
legislation
proposed.
as
i
said,
binding
and
gagging
didn’t
do
any
good.
and
at
first
the
judge
was
leery
in
the
sense
of
saying
anything
to
mayberry
about
his
contumacious
conduct
in
front
of
the
jury.
i
think,
very
honestly
that
he
felt
that
he
didn’t
want
to
prejudice
mayberry
in
front
of
the
jury
presiding
him
for
contempt
and
again,
mayberry
was
acting
as
his
own
counsel.
so,
for
the
judge
to
have
the
jury
leave
the
courtroom
and
cite
him
specifically
might
not
have
served
the
purpose
or
might
only
--
the
end
result
had
mayberry
so
inflamed
as
to
continue
this
course
of
conduct
probably
even
in
a
more
serious
thing
and
eventually
cause
the
trial
to
stop.
now,
we
almost
concede
that
we
are
concerned
about
the
11
to
22
years
sentence.
it
does
in
view
of
previous
contempts,
that
have
come
before
this
court,
seem
rather
severe.
we
maintain
however,
that
the
actions
of
mayberry
here
were
so
outrageous
and
so
outlandish
as
to
far
exceed
anything
that
has
come
before
this
court.
ms.
carol
mary
los
yes.
that
is,
i
think,
the
major
difficulty
before
this
court
doing
anything
to
lessen
the
sentence.
i
think
the
only
course
that
can
be
entertained
at
this
point
if
you
feel
that
11
to
22
years
is
cruel
and
unusual
punishments
--
ms.
carol
mary
los
--
is
to
remand
on
a
habeas
corpus,
your
honor.
to
hold
a
hearing,
to
determine
all
of
the
relevant
facts
that
must
come
before
this
court
can
determine
that
11
to
22
years
was
unjustified.
ms.
carol
mary
los
yes,
we
do
your
honor.
ms.
carol
mary
los
yes,
that’s
true.
we
do
have
a
vehicle
to
deal
with
this
--
ms.
carol
mary
los
no,
because
certainly
they
were
given
after
the
trial.
i
think
the
purpose
--
ms.
carol
mary
los
well,
i
think
that
might
have
been
one
of
the
ends.
i
think,
secondly
though,
because
the
case
did
have
a
great
deal
of
notoriety.
because
of
the
fact
that
a
lot
of
inmates
penitentiary
or
prisoners
who
are
out
on
bail
or
who
rather
bond
or
had
not
yet
come
for
trial
were
watching
this
closely.
there’s
evidence
by
a
great
number
of
people
who
came
into
the
courtroom
and
then
a
number
that
had
caused
a
commotion
along
with
mayberry.
i
think
the
purpose
was
to
show
that
a
man
cannot
do
this
and
get
away
with
it.
and
that’s
the
fact
that
there
was
so
much
notoriety,
i'm
sure
the
trial
judge
realized
that
the
prisoners
and
those
come
into
trial
would
watch
very
closely
to
see
how
mayberry
was
dealt
with.
ms.
carol
mary
los
i
think
the
question
here
ought
to
be,
“what
should
he
have
done
in
1966?”
i
think
in
1966
under
due
process
standards
as
the
court,
the
pennsylvania
court
interpreted
them
and
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
interpreted
them
relying
on
in
re
oliver,
the
trial
judge
had
the
absolute
right
to
sentence
the
petitioner
as
the
hearing
judge.
ms.
carol
mary
los
certainly,
if
the
remarks
are
directed
personally
to
him.
it’s
our
belief
--
ms.
carol
mary
los
but
yes,
your
honor.
but
the
purpose
of
them
i
think,
and
i
think
the
trial
judge
was
able
to
see
this.
it
was
directed
towards
stopping
the
trial.
ms.
carol
mary
los
but
that’s
an
assumption
we’re
making
your
honor.
i
think
he
felt
that
the
administration
of
justice
and
that
the
proper
handling
of
this
trial
was
insulted,
so
to
speak.
ms.
carol
mary
los
no,
your
honor.
the
statute
is
set
forth
for
you.
this
is
the
--
ms.
carol
mary
los
yes,
your
honor.
we
have
no
distinction
of
that
sort.
no,
your
honor.
we
don’t.
but
my
only
answer
to
that
really
is
and
i
honestly
feel
that
the
judge
himself
did
not
feel
these
were
personal
attacks
upon
his
own
character.
i
think
he
understood
them
in
the
context
of
what
mayberry
was
attempting
to
do.
ms.
carol
mary
los
then
i
think,
we
have
a
completely
different
ball
game
because
we
are
then
bound
by
ruling
of
this
court
that
if
the
sentence
can
exceed
six
months,
certainly,
--
ms.
carol
mary
los
i
think
the
severity
of
the
sentence
your
honor.
i
believe,
it’s
the
feeling
of
this
court
--
ms.
carol
mary
los
i
think
because
there,
a
man’s
right
to
be
tried
by
his
on
peers
where
a
serious
sentence
is
involved
and
a
serious
crime
is
involved
overrides
the
administration
of
justice.
in
other
words,
the
(inaudible)
to
the
court
which
should
be
dealt
with
by
the
judge
himself,
so
--
ms.
carol
mary
los
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
carol
mary
los
i
was
just
going
to
say,
we
will
not
deny
that
this
is
a
serious
a
offense.
but
we
must
talk
in
terms
of
1966
standards
and
not
1970
if
i
may
--
ms.
carol
mary
los
i
don’t
feel
as
if
another
judge
would
have
to
hear
this
case
because
it
is
my
firm
belief,
that
while
certainly
the
phrase
“a
stumbling
old
dog”
were
directed
toward
the
judge
or
“i'm
not
going
to
argue
with
fools”,
meaning
the
judge.
i
think
the
purpose
was
clearly
understood.
ms.
carol
mary
los
no,
your
honor.
and
the
reason
why
i
feel
here
that
this
was
not
just
one
continuing
offense.
these
were
separate
events
and
correctly
separate
citation.
ms.
carol
mary
los
yes.
ms.
carol
mary
los
first
of
all,
the
sentencing
was
not
given
out
until
the
end
of
the
trial.
the
petitioner
and
his
co-defendants
were
warned
repeatedly
by
the
trial
judge
and
in
fact
at
one
point,
judge
called
counsel
before
him
and
expressly
asked
counsel
to
go
through
the
possibilities
of
contempt
and
the
actions
of
their
clients
because
he
felt
that
they
should
be
well
aware
that
their
actions
we
contemptuous.
now,
the
fact
that
he
waited
until
the
end
of
trial,
i
think,
it
was
done
solely
to
protect
the
petitioner
and
his
co-defendant.
so
that
the
petitioner
wouldn’t
become
first
of
all,
so
inflamed
and
so
enraged
that
he
would
stop
the
trial
by
means
of
letting
the
jury
know
and
again,
getting
so
out
of
hand
that
the
trial
couldn’t
continue.
i
think
that
since
his
purpose
here
was
to
protect
the
petitioner
and
certainly
to
protect
the
common
laws
right
to
see
the
case
through
to
its
just
ends,
the
petitioner
cannot,
now
say,
well
the
judge
couldn’t
do
at
the
end
of
trial
what
he
could
do
in
the
middle
of
trial.

he
had

your

is
true.
ms.

--
ms.
carol
mary

yes.
10
to
20
years,
your
honor.
yes,
for
second
degree.
ms.
carol
mary
los
your
honor,
we’re
talking
here
about
an
(inaudible)
to
public
justice
and
not
to
one
individual.
we’re
talking
about
a
man
disrupting
the
orderly
administration
of
justice,
affronting
the
dignity
and
honor
of
the
court.
ms.
carol
mary
los
that
is
true
but
i
fully
believe
that
the
judge
understood,
mayberry’s
purpose
in
doing
this
was
not
directed
toward
him
as
such.
only
because
mayberry’s
chief
purpose
was
to
stop
the
trial.
ms.
carol
mary
los
i
believe
he
knew
that,
your
honor.
ms.
carol
mary
los
for
these
reasons.
first
of
all,
as
i
say
mayberry
had
threatened
several
times
and
he
boasted
that
the
trial
would
never
reach
its
completion.
secondly,
he
--
ms.
carol
mary
los
because
there
--
it
was
not
part
of
testimony,
your
honor.
ms.
carol
mary
los
right.
and
that
is
why
i'm
asking
you
that
you
are
--
ms.
carol
mary
los
and
that’s
why,
i
respectfully
ask,
that
if
you
feel
this
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
that
you
remand
it
for
hearing,
so
that
all
the
facts
can
be
put
before
the
court
because
as
the
record
stands,
it’s
a
very
cold
record
and
as
exerted,
it
appears
as
if
mayberry
might
have
been
justified
for
some
of
the
comments
that
he
made.
i
think
that
it
so
distorts
what
actually
happened
to
trial
that
this
court
cannot
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
that
was
actually
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
without
a
complete
hearing
on
what
actually
occurred.
ms.
carol
mary
los
no,
i'm
not
your
honor.
because
i
still
believe
that
1966
standards
must
apply
and
as
such
in
1966,
pennsylvania
law
rely
--
the
interpretations
by
the
state
of
pennsylvania,
relying
upon
in
re
oliver
were
that
a
judge
could
sentence
summarily
without
due
process
safeguards
that
are
now
essential.
for
example,
in
the
serious
crime
and
we
will
concede
that
11
to
22
years
as
a
serious
offense.
ms.
carol
mary
los
absolutely
none,
your
honor.
ms.
carol
mary
los
absolutely
no
difficulty.
i
think,
absolutely
he
weren’t
been
convicted.
ms.
carol
mary
los
that
may
very
well
be
true,
your
honor.
but
i
don’t
think
that
officiates
the
proceeding
that
we
had
here.
i
think
the
judge
did
have
an
absolute
right
to
sentence
as
he
did
summarily.
ms.
carol
mary
los
i
think
he
had
the
right
under
the
acts
in
cruel
and
unusual
punishment,
absent
that
argument,
i
think
he
absolutely
had
the
right
to
do
that.
ms.
carol
mary
los
if
he
was
entitled
to
a
trial
though,
your
honor.
i
disagree
with
you
that
he
was.
i
think
that
the
judge
had
the
right
because
the
administration
of
justice
was
affronted.
ms.
carol
mary
los
i
feel
that
in
1966,
--
ms.
carol
mary
los
yes,
your
honor
and
i
think
that
we
must
judge
this
in
terms
--
ms.
carol
mary
los
oh,
no.
certainly
not
now,
your
honor.
ms.
carol
mary
los
i
think
it’s
only
fair
that
if
we
are
going
to
judge
what
a
trial
judge
did
in
1966
under
their
standards,
that
he
do
it
in
terms
that
the
hearing
be
done
in
terms
of
what
was
the
law
in
pennsylvania
at
that
time.
thank
you.
ms.
carol
mary
los
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
were
originally
of
the
opinion
that
the
entire
trial
transcript
should
be
printed
in
the
appendix
for
the
court
because
we
felt
that
only
by
reading
the
entire
trial
transcript
could
this
court
get
some
idea
of
the
feelings,
and
the
tensions,
and
the
pressures
that
existed
throughout
this
long
five
week
trial.
unfortunately,
going
through
the
trial
transcript
we
realized
that
by
the
court's
stenographer
merely
really
taking
down
the
words
that
happened
that
so
much
missed
the
court’s
stenographer
or
could
not
be
taken
down
simply
in
the
method
of
words
that
this
court
could
not
feel
simply
from
a
cold
record,
the
tensions,
and
the
pressures
that
existed
that
day
or
the
response
that
the
petitioner
was
able
to
evoke,
not
only
from
his
co-defendants
or
from
the
jury,
but
from
the
spectators
who
were
in
the
courtroom
at
the
time.
apparently,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
petitioner
might
be
able
to
take
advantage
of
this
cold
record
in
denying,
first
of
all,
that
he
is
an
extremely
intelligent
and
articulate
man.
and
secondly,
that
he
was
not
the
ring
leader
or
the
instigator
of
all
of
these
contempts.
if
i
may
just
for
a
few
moments
to
recap
some
of
the
events
of
the
trial
that
might
not
necessarily
be
printed
in
the
trial
record.
this
was
the
second
trial
that
had
begun
in
these
charges.
the
first
ended
in
the
mistrial
when
the
petitioner
alleged
that
a
prospective
juror
had
seen
him
handcuffed
to
a
sheriff,
a
mistrial
was
granted
and
the
petitioner
boasted
at
this
time
that
he
would
never
be
brought
to
trial
in
these
charges,
that
if
all
those
failed,
he
would
break
out
of
jail.
he
threatened
the
prosecutor
and
stated
that
prosecutor
would
never
see
him
from
the
trial
in
these
charges
for
prison
breach.
these
weren’t
idle
threats.
mayberry
had
previously
broken
out
of
the
eastern
penitentiary
in
pennsylvania,
the
western
penitentiary
in
pennsylvania,
the
graterford
prison
he
attempted
a
prison
breach
and
during
the
course
of
this
trial,
he
was
able
to
break
out
at
the
allegany
county
jail.
this
prison
breach
occurred
almost
in
the
middle
of
this
particular
trial.
at
the
time
it
occurred
on
a
weekend,
the
petitioner
and
his
two
co-defendants
as
well
as
three
other
inmates
of
the
allegany
county
jail
broke
out,
kidnapped
the
city
police
officer,
who
was
on
duty
at
that
time
and
were
able
to
get
a
good
distance
from
the
city
before
they
were
captured.
it
was
only
because
the
gun
that
they
had
secured
from
the
police
officer
misfired
that
a
police
officer
was
not
killed
at
close
range.
as
i
say,
this
occurred
during
the
course
of
a
trial
and
does
not
necessarily
appear
as
the
matter
of
record.
but
in
any
event,
petitioner
from
the
start
was
deemed
to
be
a
very
dangerous
individual.
the
courtroom,
understandably
contained
the
great
number
of
sheriff’s
deputies.
trial
began
before
judge
fiok
and
mayberry
as
has
been
set
forth
before
decided
that
he
wanted
to
act
as
his
own
counsel
and
refused
the
help
of
counsel
that
was
appointed
for
him.
counsel,
nonetheless
appeared
throughout
the
trial
and
was
there
at
the
sentencing
for
the
contempt
citations.
mayberry
requested
from
the
trial
judge
that
he
permitted
to
come
to
sidebar,
whenever
he
wished,
the
trial
judge
refused
this.
first
of
all,
i
believe
that
because
mayberry
was
a
very
dangerous
individual
and
a
search
of
mayberry’s
legal
papers
during
the
trial
revealed
that
he
had
placed
sharpened
razor
blades
inside
of
his
legal
pad.
secondly,
one
of
the
co-defendants
had
been
throwing
pencils
at
the
judge,
during
the
trial.
so
i
mean,
there’s
a
certainly
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
the
judge
himself
might
have
feared
that
his
life
was
in
danger.
there
was
a
bodyguard
especially
assigned
to
the
prosecutor
after
the
threats
and
the
petitioner
became
so
numerous
across
the
counsel
table.
these
again
are
not
recorded
in
the
trial
transcript
because
the
court
stenographer
was
not
within
the
hearing
range.
nonetheless,
the
request
for
sidebar
was
refused.
mayberry
started
a
series
of
taunts
to
the
judge
which
continued
throughout
the
trial.
his
attitude
was
this,
“i
want
an
explanation
that
satisfies
me
right
now
and
if
i
don’t
get
it,
i'm
not
going
to
continue
with
this
trial.”
for
example,
a
very
good
example
i
think
occurs
at
the
end
of
trial
when
he
closes
to
the
jury.
he
is
told
that
he
will
only
be
permitted
an
hour
to
close.
the
end
of
the
hour,
he
is
given
an
additional
15
minutes,
mayberry
decides
that
he
wants
just
to
continue
his
closing
to
the
jury.
when
he
refuses
to
hear
the
judge’s
warnings,
he
is
taken
out
of
the
courtroom
and
another
co-defendant
is
permitted
to
close.
when
mayberry
is
brought
back
in
again,
he
gets
off
and
starts
closing
to
the
jury
again,
he’s
again
taken
out
of
the
room.
so
that
the
trial
judge
attempted
on
several
occasions,
various
different
methods,
he
had
him
taken
out
of
the
room
at
least
10
or
11
times.
when
brought
back,
mayberry
proceeded
the
same
way
as
when
he
had
left
off,
when
he
was
taken
out
of
the
room.
he
was
bound
and
gagged.
but
unfortunately,
he
was
able
to
shout
through
the
gag
and
pound
on
the
floor.
his
shoes
and
the
shoes
of
his
co-defendants
were
removed.
he
still
raised
such
a
ruckus
that
the
trial
judge
was
unable
to
charge
to
the
jury.
now,
when
mayberry
would
direct
one
of
his
assaults
to
the
trial
judge,
petitioner’s
brief
would
have
you
believed
that
nothing
merely
happen
except
the
judge
said,
“continue
on
with
your
questioning.”
what
happened
precisely
was
this,
mayberry
was
greatly
amused
by
the
fact
that
there
were
loud
gossips
in
the
courtroom
that
the
jury
was
shocked
that
some
of
the
spectators
were
shocked.
he
would
burst
out
into
this
loud
laughter
which
was
followed
by
his
co-defendant,
who
would
hoot
and
howl,
and
applaud,
and
stamp
their
feet.
and
in
fact,
the
reason
we
say
that
mayberry
was
the
ring
leader
here
was
that
when
he
would
return
to
his
seat,
he
would
lean
across
to
the
prosecutor
and
say,
“now,
watch
this.”
and
would
stand
up
and
repeat
something.
ms.
carol
mary
los
yes,
they
were
your
honor.
ms.
carol
mary
los
yes,
there
were.
what
mayberry
did
was
he
would
lean
to
them
and
say,
“now,
it’s
your
turn”,
or
after
he
would
repeat
something,
if
one
of
the
men
wouldn’t
get
up,
he’d
give
him
a
nudge
inside
and
the
co-defendant
would
spring
up
and
direct
some
abuse
to
the
judge.
ms.
carol
mary
los
all
three
of
them
were,
your
honor.
yes.
ms.
carol
mary
los
they
did
not
take
the
cases
on
appeal.
ms.
carol
mary
los
that
is
true.
ms.
carol
mary
los
they
got
one
to
two
year
sentences
precisely
as
mayberry
had.
only
they
were
not
cited
for
contempt
as
many
times.
i
believe
one
was
cited
six
times
and
the
other
was
cited
for
seven
different
occasions
during
the
trial.
ms.
carol
mary
los
i
believe
that
is
true.
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
carol
mary
los
i
do
not
believe
that
there
was
an
appeal
taken.
at
least,
not
to
my
knowledge.
ms.
carol
mary
los
no.
i
was
not
at
the
trial
but
i
had
the
benefit
of
talking
with
the
prosecutor
on
numerous
occasions
and
again,
i
was
in
the
law
school
at
the
time
of
this
trial.
but
there
was
a
great
deal
of
publicity
and
in
fact,
that
this
was
a
case
of
some
notoriety
at
the
time.
ms.
carol
mary
los
yes,
your
honor.
this
is
in
pittsburgh
in
allegany
county.
incidentally,
after
mayberry
would
nudge
one
of
his
co-defendants
and
asked
them
to
indicating
to
them
to
stand
up
and
raise
some
ruckus.
he
would
then
after
they
had
addressed
something
too
rude
to
the
trial
judge,
he
would
stand
up
and
ask
for
a
mistrial
and
when
that
was
denied,
he
would
ask
for
severance
on
the
grounds
that
he
was
prejudiced
in
front
of
the
jury
about
what
his
co-defendants
had
said.
there
was
also
in
the
back
of
the
courtroom,
a
small
group
of
men
who
were
later
identified
as
being
inmates,
who
were
either
out
on
bond,
who
were
released
from
prison,
who
were
known
to
mayberry.
and
after
he
would
direct
something
to
the
judge,
he
would
turn
around
in
laughing
manner
toward
them,
they
would
again
applaud
and
would
stamp
their
feet
and
so
it’s
to
create
such
a
disturbance
--
ms.
carol
mary
los
oh,
no
your
honor.
they
were
removed
from
the
courtroom.
but
what
--
i
am
saying
is
that
the
purpose
of
his
remarks
to
the
judge
were
not
just
to
excoriate
the
judge,
the
purpose
was
to
create
sufficient
ruckus
so
that
there
would
be
delay
in
the
trial.
ms.
carol
mary
los
i
am
not
aware
of
any
i
know
that
of
course
that
none
in
the
interim
period
has
passed.
i
cannot
say
with
any
certainty
that
there
has
been
legislation
proposed.
as
i
said,
binding
and
gagging
didn’t
do
any
good.
and
at
first
the
judge
was
leery
in
the
sense
of
saying
anything
to
mayberry
about
his
contumacious
conduct
in
front
of
the
jury.
i
think,
very
honestly
that
he
felt
that
he
didn’t
want
to
prejudice
mayberry
in
front
of
the
jury
presiding
him
for
contempt
and
again,
mayberry
was
acting
as
his
own
counsel.
so,
for
the
judge
to
have
the
jury
leave
the
courtroom
and
cite
him
specifically
might
not
have
served
the
purpose
or
might
only
--
the
end
result
had
mayberry
so
inflamed
as
to
continue
this
course
of
conduct
probably
even
in
a
more
serious
thing
and
eventually
cause
the
trial
to
stop.
now,
we
almost
concede
that
we
are
concerned
about
the
11
to
22
years
sentence.
it
does
in
view
of
previous
contempts,
that
have
come
before
this
court,
seem
rather
severe.
we
maintain
however,
that
the
actions
of
mayberry
here
were
so
outrageous
and
so
outlandish
as
to
far
exceed
anything
that
has
come
before
this
court.
ms.
carol
mary
los
yes.
that
is,
i
think,
the
major
difficulty
before
this
court
doing
anything
to
lessen
the
sentence.
i
think
the
only
course
that
can
be
entertained
at
this
point
if
you
feel
that
11
to
22
years
is
cruel
and
unusual
punishments
--
ms.
carol
mary
los
--
is
to
remand
on
a
habeas
corpus,
your
honor.
to
hold
a
hearing,
to
determine
all
of
the
relevant
facts
that
must
come
before
this
court
can
determine
that
11
to
22
years
was
unjustified.
ms.
carol
mary
los
yes,
we
do
your
honor.
ms.
carol
mary
los
yes,
that’s
true.
we
do
have
a
vehicle
to
deal
with
this
--
ms.
carol
mary
los
no,
because
certainly
they
were
given
after
the
trial.
i
think
the
purpose
--
ms.
carol
mary
los
well,
i
think
that
might
have
been
one
of
the
ends.
i
think,
secondly
though,
because
the
case
did
have
a
great
deal
of
notoriety.
because
of
the
fact
that
a
lot
of
inmates
penitentiary
or
prisoners
who
are
out
on
bail
or
who
rather
bond
or
had
not
yet
come
for
trial
were
watching
this
closely.
there’s
evidence
by
a
great
number
of
people
who
came
into
the
courtroom
and
then
a
number
that
had
caused
a
commotion
along
with
mayberry.
i
think
the
purpose
was
to
show
that
a
man
cannot
do
this
and
get
away
with
it.
and
that’s
the
fact
that
there
was
so
much
notoriety,
i'm
sure
the
trial
judge
realized
that
the
prisoners
and
those
come
into
trial
would
watch
very
closely
to
see
how
mayberry
was
dealt
with.
ms.
carol
mary
los
i
think
the
question
here
ought
to
be,
“what
should
he
have
done
in
1966?”
i
think
in
1966
under
due
process
standards
as
the
court,
the
pennsylvania
court
interpreted
them
and
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
interpreted
them
relying
on
in
re
oliver,
the
trial
judge
had
the
absolute
right
to
sentence
the
petitioner
as
the
hearing
judge.
ms.
carol
mary

certainly,
if
the
remarks
are
directed
personally
to
him.
it’s
our
belief
--
ms.
carol
mary
los
but
yes,
your
honor.
but
the
purpose
of
them
i
think,
and
i
think
the
trial
judge
was
able
to
see
this.
it
was
directed
towards
stopping
the
trial.
ms.
carol
mary
los
but
that’s
an
assumption
we’re
making
your
honor.
i
think
he
felt
that
the
administration
of
justice
and
that
the
proper
handling
of
this
trial
was
insulted,
so
to
speak.
ms.
carol
mary
los
no,
your
honor.
the
statute
is
set
forth
for
you.
this
is
the
--
ms.
carol
mary
los
yes,
your
honor.
we
have
no
distinction
of
that
sort.
no,
your
honor.
we
don’t.
but
my
only
answer
to
that
really
is
and
i
honestly
feel
that
the
judge
himself
did
not
feel
these
were
personal
attacks
upon
his
own
character.
i
think
he
understood
them
in
the
context
of
what
mayberry
was
attempting
to
do.
ms.
carol
mary
los
then
i
think,
we
have
a
completely
different
ball
game
because
we
are
then
bound
by
ruling
of
this
court
that
if
the
sentence
can
exceed
six
months,
certainly,
--
ms.
carol
mary
los
i
think
the
severity
of
the
sentence
your
honor.
i
believe,
it’s
the
feeling
of
this
court
--
ms.
carol
mary
los
i
think
because
there,
a
man’s
right
to
be
tried
by
his
on
peers
where
a
serious
sentence
is
involved
and
a
serious
crime
is
involved
overrides
the
administration
of
justice.
in
other
words,
the
(inaudible)
to
the
court
which
should
be
dealt
with
by
the
judge
himself,
so
--
ms.
carol
mary
los
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
carol
mary
los
i
was
just
going
to
say,
we
will
not
deny
that
this
is
a
serious
a
offense.
but
we
must
talk
in
terms
of
1966
standards
and
not
1970
if
i
may
--
ms.
carol
mary
los
i
don’t
feel
as
if
another
judge
would
have
to
hear
this
case
because
it
is
my
firm
belief,
that
while
certainly
the
phrase
“a
stumbling
old
dog”
were
directed
toward
the
judge
or
“i'm
not
going
to
argue
with
fools”,
meaning
the
judge.
i
think
the
purpose
was
clearly
understood.
ms.
carol
mary
los
no,
your
honor.
and
the
reason
why
i
feel
here
that
this
was
not
just
one
continuing
offense.
these
were
separate
events
and
correctly
separate
citation.
ms.
carol
mary
los
yes.
ms.
carol
mary
los
first
of
all,
the
sentencing
was
not
given
out
until
the
end
of
the
trial.
the
petitioner
and
his
co-defendants
were
warned
repeatedly
by
the
trial
judge
and
in
fact
at
one
point,
judge
called
counsel
before
him
and
expressly
asked
counsel
to
go
through
the
possibilities
of
contempt
and
the
actions
of
their
clients
because
he
felt
that
they
should
be
well
aware
that
their
actions
we
contemptuous.
now,
the
fact
that
he
waited
until
the
end
of
trial,
i
think,
it
was
done
solely
to
protect
the
petitioner
and
his
co-defendant.
so
that
the
petitioner
wouldn’t
become
first
of
all,
so
inflamed
and
so
enraged
that
he
would
stop
the
trial
by
means
of
letting
the
jury
know
and
again,
getting
so
out
of
hand
that
the
trial
couldn’t
continue.
i
think
that
since
his
purpose
here
was
to
protect
the
petitioner
and
certainly
to
protect
the
common
laws
right
to
see
the
case
through
to
its
just
ends,
the
petitioner
cannot,
now
say,
well
the
judge
couldn’t
do
at
the
end
of
trial
what
he
could
do
in
the
middle
of
trial.
ms.
carol
mary
los
if
he
had
requested
a
jury.
yes,
your
honor
that
is
true.
ms.
carol
mary
los
11
--
ms.
carol
mary
los
yes.
10
to
20
years,
your
honor.
yes,
for
second
degree.
ms.
carol
mary
los
your
honor,
we’re
talking
here
about
an
(inaudible)
to
public
justice
and
not
to
one
individual.
we’re
talking
about
a
man
disrupting
the
orderly
administration
of
justice,
affronting
the
dignity
and
honor
of
the
court.
ms.
carol
mary
los
that
is
true
but
i
fully
believe
that
the
judge
understood,
mayberry’s
purpose
in
doing
this
was
not
directed
toward
him
as
such.
only
because
mayberry’s
chief
purpose
was
to
stop
the
trial.
ms.
carol
mary
los
i
believe
he
knew
that,
your
honor.
ms.
carol
mary
los
for
these
reasons.
first
of
all,
as
i
say
mayberry
had
threatened
several
times
and
he
boasted
that
the
trial
would
never
reach
its
completion.
secondly,
he
--
ms.
carol
mary
los
because
there
--
it
was
not
part
of
testimony,
your
honor.
ms.
carol
mary
los
right.
and
that
is
why
i'm
asking
you
that
you
are
--
ms.
carol
mary
los
and
that’s
why,
i
respectfully
ask,
that
if
you
feel
this
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
that
you
remand
it
for
hearing,
so
that
all
the
facts
can
be
put
before
the
court
because
as
the
record
stands,
it’s
a
very
cold
record
and
as
exerted,
it
appears
as
if
mayberry
might
have
been
justified
for
some
of
the
comments
that
he
made.
i
think
that
it
so
distorts
what
actually
happened
to
trial
that
this
court
cannot
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
that
was
actually
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
without
a
complete
hearing
on
what
actually
occurred.
ms.
carol
mary
los
no,
i'm
not
your
honor.
because
i
still
believe
that
1966
standards
must
apply
and
as
such
in
1966,
pennsylvania
law
rely
--
the
interpretations
by
the
state
of
pennsylvania,
relying
upon
in
re
oliver
were
that
a
judge
could
sentence
summarily
without
due
process
safeguards
that
are
now
essential.
for
example,
in
the
serious
crime
and
we
will
concede
that
11
to
22
years
as
a
serious
offense.
ms.
carol
mary
los
absolutely
none,
your
honor.
ms.
carol
mary
los
absolutely
no
difficulty.
i
think,
absolutely
he
weren’t
been
convicted.
ms.
carol
mary
los
that
may
very
well
be
true,
your
honor.
but
i
don’t
think
that
officiates
the
proceeding
that
we
had
here.
i
think
the
judge
did
have
an
absolute
right
to
sentence
as
he
did
summarily.
ms.
carol
mary
los
i
think
he
had
the
right
under
the
acts
in
cruel
and
unusual
punishment,
absent
that
argument,
i
think
he
absolutely
had
the
right
to
do
that.
ms.
carol
mary
los
if
he
was
entitled
to
a
trial
though,
your
honor.
i
disagree
with
you
that
he
was.
i
think
that
the
judge
had
the
right
because
the
administration
of
justice
was
affronted.
ms.
carol
mary
los
i
feel
that
in
1966,
--
ms.
carol
mary
los
yes,
your
honor
and
i
think
that
we
must
judge
this
in
terms
--
ms.
carol
mary
los
oh,
no.
certainly
not
now,
your
honor.
ms.
carol
mary
los
i
think
it’s
only
fair
that
if
we
are
going
to
judge
what
a
trial
judge
did
in
1966
under
their
standards,
that
he
do
it
in
terms
that
the
hearing
be
done
in
terms
of
what
was
the
law
in
pennsylvania
at
that
time.
thank
you.
