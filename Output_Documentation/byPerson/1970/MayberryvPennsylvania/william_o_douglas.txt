well,

can’t
we?
justice

may
i
ask
mr.
reitz,
does
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
have
a
power
comparable
to
our
so-called
supervisory
power
which
i
guess
is
what
we
used
in
the
yates
case?
in
other
words,
could
that
court
have
reduced
the
sentence?
justice

douglas
do
i
correctly
infer
from

jones’
treatment
of
the
questions

unusual
punishment

well,
i
notice
the
opinion
doesn’t
seem
to
address
itself
to
any
other
basis
for
the
challenge
to
the
sentence.
