mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
i’ll
try.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it's
fortuitous
that
the
morning
ends
with
the
case
that
involves
a
different
kind
of
speech.
we
have
here
a
criminal
contempt
case
arising
from
pennsylvania
which
is
in
my
research
unprecedented
in
the
law
of
criminal
contempt.
we
have
a
defendant
who
was
on
trial
in
1966
under
two
very
serious
charges
for
prison
breach
and
for
holding
hostage,
in
the
course
of
a
prison
breach,
charges
which
had
a
potential
of
life
imprisonment
under
the
second
of
those
charges.
the
trial
lasted
22
days,
22
trial
days,
it
stretched
from
november
7
until
december
22
on
a
calendar.
during
those
22
days
of
the
defendant
and
two
co-defendants
were
representing
themselves
on
these
very
serious
charges.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial,
after
the
jury
verdict
had
been
brought
in
on
22nd
day,
the
trial
judge
opened
the
next
session
of
court
on
monday
morning
and
excoriated
all
three
defendants,
summarily
convicted
them
of
criminal
contempt
and
held
that
as
to
11
separate
days,
although,
there
were
multiple
incidents
involved,
that
petitioner
mayberry
had
been
guilty
of
criminal
contempt.
on
each
one
of
those
11
charges
as
he
recited
the
facts
as
he
recalled
them,
he
imposed
a
sentence
of
a
minimum
of
one
year
and
a
maximum
of
two
years
in
state
prison.
after
each
one
of
those
sentences
following
the
first,
he
directed
that
each
one
of
those
sentences
be
served
consecutively.
so
that
the
first
of
his
impositions
of
sentence
was
a
sentence
in
aggregation
of
11
years
at
a
minimum
and
22
years
at
a
maximum
for
criminal
contempt.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
he
then
proceeded
mr.
chief
justice
to
sentence
on
a
substantive
charge
and
he
gave
a
sentence
for
prison
breach
of
10
years
which
was
the
maximum.
five
years
minimum,
10
years
maximum
which
was
the
maximum
permitted
by
the
statutes
of
pennsylvania
for
prison
breach.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
that
was
also
consecutive.
he
then
imposed
a
sentence
of
30
years
maximum,
15
years
minimum
for
the
charge
of
holding
hostage.
the
aggregate
of
all
of
that
was
40
years
on
the
substantive
crimes,
22
years
for
criminal
contempt
or
a
net
sentence
of
62
years
with
a
31-year
minimum.
that
was
the
sentence
imposed
that
morning.
i'm
told,
although,
i
have
not
seen
the
documents
itself
that
a
few
days
later,
he
reversed
the
order
of
sentencing
so
that
the
--
although,
he
started
that
monday
morning
with
the
criminal
contempt
sentence
and
then
followed
with
the
substantive
crimes
but
he
directed
the
sentence
on
a
substantive
crimes.
for
40
years,
he
served
first
and
then
the
22
years
for
criminal
contempt.
but
the
net
effect
of
the
sentencing
that
morning
was
22
years
for
criminal
contempt,
40
years
for
substantive
crime,
62
years
total.
i
am
aware
of
no
criminal
contempt
sentence
which
comes
even
within
a
long
distance
of
that
sentence.
there
had
been
many
studies
made
of
criminal
contempts
over
the
years.
none
of
them
reflected
a
sentence
that
is
even
one-seventh,
who’s
great
for
any
kind
of
criminal
contempt.
in
that
same
session,
the
judge
sentenced
the
two
co-defendants
also
for
criminal
contempt.
on
exactly
the
same
methodology,
he
had
it
this
per
diem
method
and
it
was
two
years
for
each
day
on
which
he
found
a
criminal
contempt
had
been
committed.
the
sentences
on
the
co-defendants
were
somewhat
shorter,
it
were
six
days
in
the
case
of
one
defendant
and
seven
days
in
the
case
of
another.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
in
some
instances,
your
honor,
the
conduct
i
would
think
would
be
substantially
worse.
one
of
the
co-defendants
verbally
threatened
the
life
of
the
judge
which
never
happened
in
the
case
of
petitioner
mayberry.
some
of
the
obstreperous,
disruptive
conduct
on
the
part
of,
one
of
the
co-defendants,
it
seems
to
me
that
have
been
substantially
worse
from
reading
the
records.
the
11
contempts
found
against
the
petitioner
mayberry
involved
nine
counts,
nine
charges
of
what
i
have
described
as
purely
verbal
epithets
directed
at
the
judge.
they
were
quite
brief.
they're
printed
in
total
in
the
appendix.
they
ranged
in
seriousness
over
a
considerable
variety
of
hyperbolic.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
oh,
they
would
be
conduct
your
honor,
which
from
any
attorney,
i
think,
would
have
been
thought
of
as
very
aggravated
in
the
instance
of
a
layman
defending
himself,
not
an
educated
layman
defending
himself
in
a
very
serious
court
with
the
kind
of
background
from
which
he
comes
and
the
life
which
he
has
led,
i’m
not
--
i
don’t
think
i
would
have
put
the
label
aggravated
on
the
verbal
contents.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
the
warnings
were
repeated
your
honor,
but
the
incidents
for
example,
late
in
the
trial,
one
of
the
two-year
sentences
is
imposed
for
the
defendant
more
or
less
expostulating
an
anger
after
having
been
prevented
from
developing
a
line
of
questioning
that
he
was
not
arguing
with
fools.
the
judge
inferred
from
that,
i
think,
relatively
properly
that
the
defendant
was
referring
to
the
judge
as
a
fool.
for
that,
he
got
two
years
in
jail.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
it
is
conduct
which
we
certainly
had
not
condoned.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
i
would
not
use
the
word
“outrageous”
your
honor
to
describe
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
he
did
indeed.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
he
had
some
rather
exotic
like
a
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
i
think
the
level
of
outrage
that
one
develops
in
this
kind
of
a
case
defends
a
good
deal
on
what
one
finds
the
level
of
expectation
from
the
speaker.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
may
it
please
the
court.
before
we
recessed
for
lunch
we
had
explored
a
bit
of
the
factual
history
of
this
case
and
had
begun
some
discussion
of
the
seriousness
of
the
verbal
conduct
on
which
the
trial
judge
in
this
case
sentenced
a
petitioner
to
so
many
years
in
jail.
i
think,
it’s
fair
to
say
that
it’s
perfectly
obvious
that
the
judge
himself
took
a
very
serious
view
of
the
conduct
of
petitioner.
indeed,
the
sentence
alone
indicates
that
he
viewed
it
as
the
most
serious
contempt
case
of
all
time
--
confirms
that.
whatever
adjective
one
might
say
is
adequate
to
describe
the
conduct
and
i
think
that
will
depend
on
many
points
of
view.
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
the
case
was
treated
as
a
very
serious
case
and
i
would
not
urge
the
court
that
this
conduct
was
either
meritorious
or
even
to
be
condoned.
what
i
do
urge
on
the
court
and
i
think
this
is
the
critical
point
and
it
is
underscored
by
whatever
view
of
seriousness
one
takes.
but
the
procedure
employed
in
handling
this
case
was
grossly
disproportionate
to
the
seriousness
of
the
crime
even
if
one
views
it
as
a
rather
petty
crime.
the
amount
of
procedural
due
process
afforded
to
this
petitioner
in
handling
this
case
was
nilled.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
oh,
indeed
your
honor.
on
a
substantive
charge
he
had
notice.
he
had
the
right
to
counsel.
he
had
the
right
to
make
preliminary
motions
including
a
motion
to
disqualify
the
judge.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
in
the
substantive
case,
he
had
waived
counsel.
he
had
insisted
on
the
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
he
had
indeed.
he
insisted
on
his
right
to
try
himself
in
that
case
which
he
is
permitted
under
the
constitution.
but
he
was
afforded
the
right
to
counsel.
counsel
was
offered
to
him
and
indeed
despite
his
waiver,
the
trial
judge
appointed
the
public
defender
to
serve
as
an
advisor
to
him
during
the
trial
and
he
was
present
throughout
the
trial
and
available
for
resource.
there
was
a
jury,
there
was
evidence
produced,
at
time
for
argument
not
only
on
the
issue
of
guilt
but
on
the
issue
of
a
litigation
of
sentence.
the
full
panoply
of
a
trial
was
followed
in
the
case
of
the
substantive
crime.
none
of
that
followed
in
the
contempt
case.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
mi
think
they
go
together
your
honor.
if
the
sentence
in
this
case
had
been
in
the
tradition
of
sentences
for
courtroom
in
de
quorum
a
few
days
or
a
few
dollars
that
happened
in,
for
example,
in
the
fisher
and
pace
case,
this
court
reviewed
many
years
ago,
the
amount
of
procedure
that
we
traditionally
have
required
in
that
kind
of
a
case
is
rather
slight,
and
indeed
if
the
judge
does
as
in
the
fisher
case
impose
or
threaten
to
impose
the
sanctions
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
the
procedural
requisites
follow
from
the
necessary
situation.
in
this
case,
we
have
an
obviously
much
different
situation
of
a
very
serious
crime
in
the
mind
of
the
judge
and
it
seems
to
me
the
nature
of
the
penalty
quite
reinforces
the
total
absence
of
any
process.
there
was
no
opportunity
in
this
case
to
do
many
of
the
things
that
the
commonwealth
in
the
briefs
suggest
petitioner
did
not
do.
he
did
not
have
an
opportunity
to
challenge
the
judge.
he
did
not
have
an
opportunity
to
waive
counsel.
he
did
not
even
have
an
opportunity
to
ask
for
counsel.
he
was
suggested
that
he
might
have
moved
after
the
fact
to
modify
sentence.
when
one
looks
at
the
record
as
to
what
happened
that
monday
morning
on
december
22nd,
after
the
judge
had
finished
imposing
the
22
years
of
sentence
on
the
petitioner,
he
asked
to
be
allowed
to
speak
and
the
judge
refused
to
hear
a
word.
at
that
stage,
the
judge
would
have
none
of
his
further
participation
in
the
courtroom
proceedings.
so,
the
absence
of
his
own
advocacy
at
that
stage
to
which
the
commonwealth
alludes
seems
to
me
to
be
quite
irrelevant.
in
addition,
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
it
is
indeed
your
honor.
the
entire
stenographic
transcript
is
here.
we
have
printed
only
a
small
portion
in
the
appendix.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
it
was
a
trial
that
lasted
for
22
trial
days
for
the
last
day
being
entirely
sentencing,
so
it
is
a
very
long
trial.
there
was
something
in
excess
of
3,000
pages
of
stenographic
transcript
in
the
trial.
in
addition
to
the
fundamental
due
process
argument,
we
make
a
separate
argument
which
is
in
some
ways
even
more
basic
and
that
was
the
opportunity
--
petitioner
was
denied
the
opportunity
to
make
any
statement
in
mitigation
of
punishment
in
this
case.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
it
might
indeed
had
been
ceremonial
because
of
the
obviously
overwrought
state
of
the
trial
judge
with
an
impartial
tribunal,
i
am
not
convinced
that
a
fairly
substantial
argument
could
not
have
been
made
in
mitigation
of
the
severity
of
the
conduct.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
of
the
conduct.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
as
you
study
the
record
your
honor,
i
don’t
think
one
would
need
to
approach
justification
in
order
to
find
there
were
indeed
issues
of
provocation
or
explanation
that
might
in
some
way
have
tempered
the
fury.
the
defendant
in
this
case
for
example
attempted
several
times
to
introduce
evidence
that
went
to
his
conduct,
immediately
after
he
was
apprehended.
the
prosecution
in
the
case
in
chief
had
put
on
a
witness
who
testified
that
after
he
was
apprehended,
he
had
still
resisted
very
forcefully,
the
arresting
officer
and
there
was
a
fight
that
took
place
going
down
the
stairs
in
the
hospital
in
which
he
was
apprehended.
petitioner
several
times
attempted
to
introduce
evidence
that
would
have
contradicted
that.
witnesses
who
would’ve
denied
that
he
was
then
in
that
state
of
flagrant
resistance.
every
time
he
tried
to
produce
that
evidence,
he
was
afforded
by
objection
on
the
part
of
the
district
attorney
without
explanation
and
objection
sustained.
in
the
face
of
this,
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
yes,
sir.
it
was
tried
in
1966.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
no
your
honor,
i
have
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
there
is
an
enormous
problem
here
with
the
severity
of
the
sanction.
it
is
so
far
out
of
keeping
with
any
of
the
customary
standards
to
which
we
have
had
look
in
the
past
for
sentencing
and
contempt
cases
that
it
simply
looms
as
an
unacceptable
judicial
act.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
that’s
the
major
difficulty
with
the
point
your
honor.
we
do
not
have
in
pennsylvania
as
we
do
not
have
in
the
federal
statutes,
a
statutory
maximum
on
sentences.
so
far
as
the
statute
is
concerned,
the
sky
is
the
limit.
we
have
and
i
have
attempted
to
collect
in
the
brief,
a
series
of
benchmarks
to
which
one
could
look
for
some
sort
of
a
ceiling
to
be
imposed
from
the
outside
on
what
a
sentencing
judge
can
do
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
we
have
many
statutory
ceilings,
none
over
six
months.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
the
constitutional
provision
on
which
we
rely
in
the
brief
your
honor,
is
the
eighth
amendment,
prohibition
of
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
that
one
might
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
one
might
try
to
make
a
substantive
due
process
argument
but
i
don’t
think
that
gives
us
any
greater
precision
as
to
the
limitations
that
one
could
impose
through
the
constitution
on
state
trial
judges.
it
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
quite
right.
this
court
lacks
the
supervisory
power.
it
lacks
the
normal,
very
broad
appellate
review
that
the
court
has
exercised
on
numerous
occasions
in
reducing
what
it
felt
to
be
mild
excesses
by
comparison
on
the
part
of
federal
trial
judges.
the
11
consecutive
counts,
concurrent
counts,
in
the
yates
case
impressed
the
court
as
being
grossly
disproportionate
to
the
offense
in
that
case
and
the
court
was
able
through
a
supervisory
power
to
deal
with
that
problem.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
i
think
your
honor.
if
this
court
finds
that
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
or
the
substantive
due
process
argument
has
merits,
some
guidance
would
have
to
be
created
as
to
the
outside
limits
that
would
be
permitted
for
this
type
of
sentence.
a
remand
of
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
which
has
already
faced
this
issue
and
rejected
it
with
one
dissenting
justice,
is
not
likely
to
generate
the
kind
of
standards
that
one
would
need
for
a
national
constitution.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
there’s
great
virtue
to
that
in
some
instances
and
many
of
the
scholars
of
federal
jurisdiction
urged
that
in
the
ultimate,
the
only
basic
safeguard
for
all
constitutional
rights
are
state
courts
that
all
federal
courts
jurisdiction
is
subject
to
statutory
limitation
by
congress.
but
in
this
instance,
we
are
in
i
think
such
a
brand
new
area
with
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
standards
that
unless
the
court
is
able
to
provide
some
reasonable
guidance
to
state
courts,
my
expectation
would
not
be
that
the
results
would
be
a
very
happy
in
the
first
instances.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
the
pennsylvania
courts
take
a
very
narrow
review,
a
narrow
position
on
their
appellate
review
sentences
generally.
their
law
of
contempt
is
relatively
unformed.
this
is
the
first
case,
which
i'm
aware
on
which
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
has
ever
faced
an
in-court
contempt
problem.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
that
argument
was
put,
that
was
not
the
sole
argument
put
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
in
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court,
all
of
the
arguments
there
before
this
court
were
raised
in
one
fashion
or
another,
mr.
mayberry
there
represented
himself.
the
court
appointed
an
attorney
to
represent
him,
who
also
filed
the
brief
and
they
raised
between
them
every
issue
that
is
now
before
this
court.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
justice
o’brien
relies
on
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
argument.
he
is
persuaded
that
in
comparison
with
the
statutory
maxima
for
a
whole
raft
of
offenses
including
second
degree
murder
being
less
than
the
sentence
imposed
on
this
defendant
for
conduct
which
bears
no
resemblance
to
the
atrocious
assaults
and
homicides
that
have
very
lesser
statutory
maximum
that
the
sentence
was
impermissible.
since,
he
was
a
lone
justice
on
that
issue,
he
was
not
forced
to
face
the
question
of
what
remedy
could
be
provided.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
i
think
an
argument
can
be
built
on
the
basis
of
existing
data
that
a
maximum
of
six
months
is
a
customary
standard
that
is
now
so
well
entrenched
by
statute
and
case
law
that
it
is
the
outside
limit
for
a
sentence
in
a
contempt
case
absent
a
statute
permitting
a
longer
one.
all
the
statutes
stop
short
of
that.
many
as
i've
indicate
stopped
far
shorter
in
terms
of
hours
or
days
for
such
punishment.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
there
were
11.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
yes
indeed,
your
honor.
i
think
we
would,
that
is
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
two
years
on
each
and
that
is
still
twice
as
long
as
the
yates
case
which
was
one
year,
11
times
concurrently
and
that
is
still
in
my
judgment
an
enormously
over
broad
sentence
for
the
kind
of
contempt
that
this
record
contains.
it
is
only
the
because
of
the
fact
that
the
multiplier
of
11
is
added
that
the
seriousness
of
that
first
sentence
can
be
lost
sight
of.
a
two-year
sentence
is
itself,
one
of
the
most
severe
in
the
whole
catalog
of
criminal
contempt
sentences.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
if
the
same
sentence
were
imposed
as
a
result
of
that
and
the
statute
provided
for
a
crime
of
obstructing
justice
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
i
would
not
make
the
argument,
your
honor.
indeed,
i
make
the
point
in
this
case
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
well,
your
honor.
in
this
case,
the
pennsylvania
contempt
statute
provides
a
limit
requiring
obstruction
of
justice.
the
first
nine
counts
in
this
case
to
me
cannot
be
brought
within
the
language
of
obstructing
justice.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
they
were
insolent,
they
were
discourteous
but
they
were
not
in
any
way
blocking
the
advance
of
the
trial.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
if
you
may
your
honor,
i
take
a
very
different
view
if
we
have
a
legislature,
having
faced
the
question
and
establishing
a
statutory
parameter
to
the
permissible
sentences.
in
this
case,
we
have
no
such
legislative
judgment
to
which
either
the
state
judges
or
this
court
can
look
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
well,
your
honor
that
statute
was
passed
in
1836.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
it
has
not
been
reviewed
since
i
think
all
of
the
statutes
in
which
they
do
appear
statutory
maxima
have
been
of
more
recent
vintage
in
that.
there
has
been
nothing
prior
to
this
case
in
which
the
pennsylvania
legislature
or
any
other
legislature
could
be
given
notice
of
the
enormous
extension
of
customary
power
to
which
a
trial
judge
might
go.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
i
could
not
agree
with
you
more
your
honor,
the
requirements
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
no,
your
honor,
i
would
not.
i
would
accept
as
so
well
grounded
in
our
law
of
criminal
contempt
that
a
judge
has
within
that
very
narrow
range
of
customary
penalties
that
the
kind
of
restraint
that
this
court
referred
to
many
years
ago
in
the
anderson
case,
that
that
is
not
--
that
can
be
handled
without
the
full
panoply
of
a
trial.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
well,
i
suggested
in
the
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
i've
suggested
in
the
brief
that
a
place
to
stop
is
the
place
this
court
stopped
in
the
bloom
case,
in
regard
to
the
right
to
jury
trial.
i
do
not
think
that
is
the
right
place
to
stop.
i
do
not
subscribe
to
that.
there
was
of
course
another
jury
trial
and
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
in
light
of
de
stefano
case
your
honor,
i
think
it
would
be
futile
to
make
that
argument
now.
i
think
the
line
has
to
be
drawn
at
a
very
low
level
at
the
point
where
the
number
of
days
and
i
would
think
it
is
number
of
days,
reaches
beyond
the
stage
where
we
can
tolerate
the
total
absence
of
anything
we
call
a
trial.
and
that
it
seems
to
me
has
to
be
very
short
and
has
to
come
within
i
think
very
well
recognized
ancient
limitations.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
i
would
not
your
honor.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
yes,
indeed.
i
think
that
is
the
point
at
which
certainly
a
trial
becomes
quite
relevant,
an
impartial
judge
and
the
opportunity
to
make
the
necessary
defense
and
litigation
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
no,
your
honor.
i
would
not
even
concede
on
the
first
60
days.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
60
days
is
a
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
no.
no,
a
trial
your
honor.
this
court
has
drawn
the
limit
of
jury
trials
for
the
moment
of
six
months.
it
seems
to
me
that
at
least
one
can
say
that
six
months
is
the
line
that
which
one
is
now
clearly
entitled
for
trial.
i
think
that
is
a
necessary
almost
a
priori
argument
from
the
bloom
decision
itself
but
it
seems
to
me
that’s
way
below
six
months
before
one
can
say
that
you
have
a
penalty,
that
is
so
trivial,
so
much
a
reprimand,
so
much
within
the
ambit
of
work.
contempt
has
traditionally
lane
of
discipline
of
lawyers.
if
one
looks
at
contempt
cases,
it’s
the
lawyers
who
are
usually
the
defendants
in
contempt
cases.
in
those
cases,
the
remedies
are
as
the
appendix
in
our
brief
indicates
extremely
short,
a
matter
of
one,
two,
three
days
and
in
that
range
i
think,
the
custom
is
now
well-established
that
a
judge
can
impose
that
kind
of
sanction.
i
would
not
attempt
to
persuade
the
court
to
change
that
now
but
60
days
is
well
beyond
that
limit
your
honor.
well
beyond.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
well,
this
court
has
faced
and
i
think
well
resolved
the
problem
of
deterrence
of
persons
who
would
disturb
the
courtroom
in
the
allen
case.
there
are
many
devices
which
can
be
used
that
do
not
involve
the
imposition
of
criminal
punishments,
summarily
imposed
by
the
judge
that
can
be
used
for
deterrence,
this
is
not
the
only
deterrent.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
the
power
to
sight
for
contempt,
not
the
power
to
impose
a
contempt
sentence
and
i
think
as
justice
black’s
opinion
makes
clear
that
citation
is
a
notice
which
requires
a
subsequent
trial.
a
trial
at
which
the
defendant
as
justice
black
noted
could
again
be
disorderly.
but
i
read
nothing
in
the
allen
case
that
would
justify
summary
in
position
of
criminal
punishments
under
the
heading
of
contempt.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
in
the
allen
case,
it’s
peculiar
your
honor.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
i
would
indeed.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
i
want
to
make
just
one
point,
your
honor
and
that
is
on
the
issue
of
retroactivity
that
has
been
discussed.
miss
los
has
testified
at
some
length,
the
matter
is
not
in
the
record
which,
of
course,
her
testimony
could
not
even
be
part
of
the
trial
on
a
remand.
it
is
to
me
a
shocking
thing
to
hear
in
any
court,
1970
a
suggestion
that
even
in
1966.
no
matter
what
one
views
the
law
in
1966
to
be
that
it
would
raise
any
question
that
a
man
is
entitled
to
a
trial
on
a
punishment
that
could
produce
22
years
of
sentence.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
i’ll
try.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it's
fortuitous
that
the
morning
ends
with
the
case
that
involves
a
different
kind
of
speech.
we
have
here
a
criminal
contempt
case
arising
from
pennsylvania
which
is
in
my
research
unprecedented
in
the
law
of
criminal
contempt.
we
have
a
defendant
who
was
on
trial
in
1966
under
two
very
serious
charges
for
prison
breach
and
for
holding
hostage,
in
the
course
of
a
prison
breach,
charges
which
had
a
potential
of
life
imprisonment
under
the
second
of
those
charges.
the
trial
lasted
22
days,
22
trial
days,
it
stretched
from
november
7
until
december
22
on
a
calendar.
during
those
22
days
of
the
defendant
and
two
co-defendants
were
representing
themselves
on
these
very
serious
charges.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial,
after
the
jury
verdict
had
been
brought
in
on
22nd
day,
the
trial
judge
opened
the
next
session
of
court
on
monday
morning
and
excoriated
all
three
defendants,
summarily
convicted
them
of
criminal
contempt
and
held
that
as
to
11
separate
days,
although,
there
were
multiple
incidents
involved,
that
petitioner
mayberry
had
been
guilty
of
criminal
contempt.
on
each
one
of
those
11
charges
as
he
recited
the
facts
as
he
recalled
them,
he
imposed
a
sentence
of
a
minimum
of
one
year
and
a
maximum
of
two
years
in
state
prison.
after
each
one
of
those
sentences
following
the
first,
he
directed
that
each
one
of
those
sentences
be
served
consecutively.
so
that
the
first
of
his
impositions
of
sentence
was
a
sentence
in
aggregation
of
11
years
at
a
minimum
and
22
years
at
a
maximum
for
criminal
contempt.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
he
then
proceeded
mr.
chief
justice
to
sentence
on
a
substantive
charge
and
he
gave
a
sentence
for
prison
breach
of
10
years
which
was
the
maximum.
five
years
minimum,
10
years
maximum
which
was
the
maximum
permitted
by
the
statutes
of
pennsylvania
for
prison
breach.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
that
was
also
consecutive.
he
then
imposed
a
sentence
of
30
years
maximum,
15
years
minimum
for
the
charge
of
holding
hostage.
the
aggregate
of
all
of
that
was
40
years
on
the
substantive
crimes,
22
years
for
criminal
contempt
or
a
net
sentence
of
62
years
with
a
31-year
minimum.
that
was
the
sentence
imposed
that
morning.
i'm
told,
although,
i
have
not
seen
the
documents
itself
that
a
few
days
later,
he
reversed
the
order
of
sentencing
so
that
the
--
although,
he
started
that
monday
morning
with
the
criminal
contempt
sentence
and
then
followed
with
the
substantive
crimes
but
he
directed
the
sentence
on
a
substantive
crimes.
for
40
years,
he
served
first
and
then
the
22
years
for
criminal
contempt.
but
the
net
effect
of
the
sentencing
that
morning
was
22
years
for
criminal
contempt,
40
years
for
substantive
crime,
62
years
total.
i
am
aware
of
no
criminal
contempt
sentence
which
comes
even
within
a
long
distance
of
that
sentence.
there
had
been
many
studies
made
of
criminal
contempts
over
the
years.
none
of
them
reflected
a
sentence
that
is
even
one-seventh,
who’s
great
for
any
kind
of
criminal
contempt.
in
that
same
session,
the
judge
sentenced
the
two
co-defendants
also
for
criminal
contempt.
on
exactly
the
same
methodology,
he
had
it
this
per
diem
method
and
it
was
two
years
for
each
day
on
which
he
found
a
criminal
contempt
had
been
committed.
the
sentences
on
the
co-defendants
were
somewhat
shorter,
it
were
six
days
in
the
case
of
one
defendant
and
seven
days
in
the
case
of
another.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
in
some
instances,
your
honor,
the
conduct
i
would
think
would
be
substantially
worse.
one
of
the
co-defendants
verbally
threatened
the
life
of
the
judge
which
never
happened
in
the
case
of
petitioner
mayberry.
some
of
the
obstreperous,
disruptive
conduct
on
the
part
of,
one
of
the
co-defendants,
it
seems
to
me
that
have
been
substantially
worse
from
reading
the
records.
the
11
contempts
found
against
the
petitioner
mayberry
involved
nine
counts,
nine
charges
of
what
i
have
described
as
purely
verbal
epithets
directed
at
the
judge.
they
were
quite
brief.
they're
printed
in
total
in
the
appendix.
they
ranged
in
seriousness
over
a
considerable
variety
of
hyperbolic.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
oh,
they
would
be
conduct
your
honor,
which
from
any
attorney,
i
think,
would
have
been
thought
of
as
very
aggravated
in
the
instance
of
a
layman
defending
himself,
not
an
educated
layman
defending
himself
in
a
very
serious
court
with
the
kind
of
background
from
which
he
comes
and
the
life
which
he
has
led,
i’m
not
--
i
don’t
think
i
would
have
put
the
label
aggravated
on
the
verbal
contents.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
the
warnings
were
repeated
your
honor,
but
the
incidents
for
example,
late
in
the
trial,
one
of
the
two-year
sentences
is
imposed
for
the
defendant
more
or
less
expostulating
an
anger
after
having
been
prevented
from
developing
a
line
of
questioning
that
he
was
not
arguing
with
fools.
the
judge
inferred
from
that,
i
think,
relatively
properly
that
the
defendant
was
referring
to
the
judge
as
a
fool.
for
that,
he
got
two
years
in
jail.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
it
is
conduct
which
we
certainly
had
not
condoned.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
i
would
not
use
the
word
“outrageous”
your
honor
to
describe
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
he
did
indeed.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
he
had
some
rather
exotic
like
a
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
i
think
the
level
of
outrage
that
one
develops
in
this
kind
of
a
case
defends
a
good
deal
on
what
one
finds
the
level
of
expectation
from
the
speaker.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
may
it
please
the
court.
before
we
recessed
for
lunch
we
had
explored
a
bit
of
the
factual
history
of
this
case
and
had
begun
some
discussion
of
the
seriousness
of
the
verbal
conduct
on
which
the
trial
judge
in
this
case
sentenced
a
petitioner
to
so
many
years
in
jail.
i
think,
it’s
fair
to
say
that
it’s
perfectly
obvious
that
the
judge
himself
took
a
very
serious
view
of
the
conduct
of
petitioner.
indeed,
the
sentence
alone
indicates
that
he
viewed
it
as
the
most
serious
contempt
case
of
all
time
--
confirms
that.
whatever
adjective
one
might
say
is
adequate
to
describe
the
conduct
and
i
think
that
will
depend
on
many
points
of
view.
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
the
case
was
treated
as
a
very
serious
case
and
i
would
not
urge
the
court
that
this
conduct
was
either
meritorious
or
even
to
be
condoned.
what
i
do
urge
on
the
court
and
i
think
this
is
the
critical
point
and
it
is
underscored
by
whatever
view
of
seriousness
one
takes.
but
the
procedure
employed
in
handling
this
case
was
grossly
disproportionate
to
the
seriousness
of
the
crime
even
if
one
views
it
as
a
rather
petty
crime.
the
amount
of
procedural
due
process
afforded
to
this
petitioner
in
handling
this
case
was
nilled.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
oh,
indeed
your
honor.
on
a
substantive
charge
he
had
notice.
he
had
the
right
to
counsel.
he
had
the
right
to
make
preliminary
motions
including
a
motion
to
disqualify
the
judge.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
in
the
substantive
case,
he
had
waived
counsel.
he
had
insisted
on
the
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
he
had
indeed.
he
insisted
on
his
right
to
try
himself
in
that
case
which
he
is
permitted
under
the
constitution.
but
he
was
afforded
the
right
to
counsel.
counsel
was
offered
to
him
and
indeed
despite
his
waiver,
the
trial
judge
appointed
the
public
defender
to
serve
as
an
advisor
to
him
during
the
trial
and
he
was
present
throughout
the
trial
and
available
for
resource.
there
was
a
jury,
there
was
evidence
produced,
at
time
for
argument
not
only
on
the
issue
of
guilt
but
on
the
issue
of
a
litigation
of
sentence.
the
full
panoply
of
a
trial
was
followed
in
the
case
of
the
substantive
crime.
none
of
that
followed
in
the
contempt
case.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
mi
think
they
go
together
your
honor.
if
the
sentence
in
this
case
had
been
in
the
tradition
of
sentences
for
courtroom
in
de
quorum
a
few
days
or
a
few
dollars
that
happened
in,
for
example,
in
the
fisher
and
pace
case,
this
court
reviewed
many
years
ago,
the
amount
of
procedure
that
we
traditionally
have
required
in
that
kind
of
a
case
is
rather
slight,
and
indeed
if
the
judge
does
as
in
the
fisher
case
impose
or
threaten
to
impose
the
sanctions
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
the
procedural
requisites
follow
from
the
necessary
situation.
in
this
case,
we
have
an
obviously
much
different
situation
of
a
very
serious
crime
in
the
mind
of
the
judge
and
it
seems
to
me
the
nature
of
the
penalty
quite
reinforces
the
total
absence
of
any
process.
there
was
no
opportunity
in
this
case
to
do
many
of
the
things
that
the
commonwealth
in
the
briefs
suggest
petitioner
did
not
do.
he
did
not
have
an
opportunity
to
challenge
the
judge.
he
did
not
have
an
opportunity
to
waive
counsel.
he
did
not
even
have
an
opportunity
to
ask
for
counsel.
he
was
suggested
that
he
might
have
moved
after
the
fact
to
modify
sentence.
when
one
looks
at
the
record
as
to
what
happened
that
monday
morning
on
december
22nd,
after
the
judge
had
finished
imposing
the
22
years
of
sentence
on
the
petitioner,
he
asked
to
be
allowed
to
speak
and
the
judge
refused
to
hear
a
word.
at
that
stage,
the
judge
would
have
none
of
his
further
participation
in
the
courtroom
proceedings.
so,
the
absence
of
his
own
advocacy
at
that
stage
to
which
the
commonwealth
alludes
seems
to
me
to
be
quite
irrelevant.
in
addition,
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
it
is
indeed
your
honor.
the
entire
stenographic
transcript
is
here.
we
have
printed
only
a
small
portion
in
the
appendix.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
it
was
a
trial
that
lasted
for
22
trial
days
for
the
last
day
being
entirely
sentencing,
so
it
is
a
very
long
trial.
there
was
something
in
excess
of
3,000
pages
of
stenographic
transcript
in
the
trial.
in
addition
to
the
fundamental
due
process
argument,
we
make
a
separate
argument
which
is
in
some
ways
even
more
basic
and
that
was
the
opportunity
--
petitioner
was
denied
the
opportunity
to
make
any
statement
in
mitigation
of
punishment
in
this
case.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
it
might
indeed
had
been
ceremonial
because
of
the
obviously
overwrought
state
of
the
trial
judge
with
an
impartial
tribunal,
i
am
not
convinced
that
a
fairly
substantial
argument
could
not
have
been
made
in
mitigation
of
the
severity
of
the
conduct.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
of
the
conduct.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
as
you
study
the
record
your
honor,
i
don’t
think
one
would
need
to
approach
justification
in
order
to
find
there
were
indeed
issues
of
provocation
or
explanation
that
might
in
some
way
have
tempered
the
fury.
the
defendant
in
this
case
for
example
attempted
several
times
to
introduce
evidence
that
went
to
his
conduct,
immediately
after
he
was
apprehended.
the
prosecution
in
the
case
in
chief
had
put
on
a
witness
who
testified
that
after
he
was
apprehended,
he
had
still
resisted
very
forcefully,
the
arresting
officer
and
there
was
a
fight
that
took
place
going
down
the
stairs
in
the
hospital
in
which
he
was
apprehended.
petitioner
several
times
attempted
to
introduce
evidence
that
would
have
contradicted
that.
witnesses
who
would’ve
denied
that
he
was
then
in
that
state
of
flagrant
resistance.
every
time
he
tried
to
produce
that
evidence,
he
was
afforded
by
objection
on
the
part
of
the
district
attorney
without
explanation
and
objection
sustained.
in
the
face
of
this,
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
yes,
sir.
it
was
tried
in
1966.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
no
your
honor,
i
have
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
there
is
an
enormous
problem
here
with
the
severity
of
the
sanction.
it
is
so
far
out
of
keeping
with
any
of
the
customary
standards
to
which
we
have
had
look
in
the
past
for
sentencing
and
contempt
cases
that
it
simply
looms
as
an
unacceptable
judicial
act.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
that’s
the
major
difficulty
with
the
point
your
honor.
we
do
not
have
in
pennsylvania
as
we
do
not
have
in
the
federal
statutes,
a
statutory
maximum
on
sentences.
so
far
as
the
statute
is
concerned,
the
sky
is
the
limit.
we
have
and
i
have
attempted
to
collect
in
the
brief,
a
series
of
benchmarks
to
which
one
could
look
for
some
sort
of
a
ceiling
to
be
imposed
from
the
outside
on
what
a
sentencing
judge
can
do
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
we
have
many
statutory
ceilings,
none
over
six
months.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
the
constitutional
provision
on
which
we
rely
in
the
brief
your
honor,
is
the
eighth
amendment,
prohibition
of
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
that
one
might
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
one
might
try
to
make
a
substantive
due
process
argument
but
i
don’t
think
that
gives
us
any
greater
precision
as
to
the
limitations
that
one
could
impose
through
the
constitution
on
state
trial
judges.
it
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
quite
right.
this
court
lacks
the
supervisory
power.
it
lacks
the
normal,
very
broad
appellate
review
that
the
court
has
exercised
on
numerous
occasions
in
reducing
what
it
felt
to
be
mild
excesses
by
comparison
on
the
part
of
federal
trial
judges.
the
11
consecutive
counts,
concurrent
counts,
in
the
yates
case
impressed
the
court
as
being
grossly
disproportionate
to
the
offense
in
that
case
and
the
court
was
able
through
a
supervisory
power
to
deal
with
that
problem.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
i
think
your
honor.
if
this
court
finds
that
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
or
the
substantive
due
process
argument
has
merits,
some
guidance
would
have
to
be
created
as
to
the
outside
limits
that
would
be
permitted
for
this
type
of
sentence.
a
remand
of
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
which
has
already
faced
this
issue
and
rejected
it
with
one
dissenting
justice,
is
not
likely
to
generate
the
kind
of
standards
that
one
would
need
for
a
national
constitution.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
there’s
great
virtue
to
that
in
some
instances
and
many
of
the
scholars
of
federal
jurisdiction
urged
that
in
the
ultimate,
the
only
basic
safeguard
for
all
constitutional
rights
are
state
courts
that
all
federal
courts
jurisdiction
is
subject
to
statutory
limitation
by
congress.
but
in
this
instance,
we
are
in
i
think
such
a
brand
new
area
with
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
standards
that
unless
the
court
is
able
to
provide
some
reasonable
guidance
to
state
courts,
my
expectation
would
not
be
that
the
results
would
be
a
very
happy
in
the
first
instances.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
the
pennsylvania
courts
take
a
very
narrow
review,
a
narrow
position
on
their
appellate
review
sentences
generally.
their
law
of
contempt
is
relatively
unformed.
this
is
the
first
case,
which
i'm
aware
on
which
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
has
ever
faced
an
in-court
contempt
problem.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
that
argument
was
put,
that
was
not
the
sole
argument
put
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
in
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court,
all
of
the
arguments
there
before
this
court
were
raised
in
one
fashion
or
another,
mr.
mayberry
there
represented
himself.
the
court
appointed
an
attorney
to
represent
him,
who
also
filed
the
brief
and
they
raised
between
them
every
issue
that
is
now
before
this
court.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
justice
o’brien
relies
on
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
argument.
he
is
persuaded
that
in
comparison
with
the
statutory
maxima
for
a
whole
raft
of
offenses
including
second
degree
murder
being
less
than
the
sentence
imposed
on
this
defendant
for
conduct
which
bears
no
resemblance
to
the
atrocious
assaults
and
homicides
that
have
very
lesser
statutory
maximum
that
the
sentence
was
impermissible.
since,
he
was
a
lone
justice
on
that
issue,
he
was
not
forced
to
face
the
question
of
what
remedy
could
be
provided.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
i
think
an
argument
can
be
built
on
the
basis
of
existing
data
that
a
maximum
of
six
months
is
a
customary
standard
that
is
now
so
well
entrenched
by
statute
and
case
law
that
it
is
the
outside
limit
for
a
sentence
in
a
contempt
case
absent
a
statute
permitting
a
longer
one.
all
the
statutes
stop
short
of
that.
many
as
i've
indicate
stopped
far
shorter
in
terms
of
hours
or
days
for
such
punishment.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
there
were
11.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
yes
indeed,
your
honor.
i
think
we
would,
that
is
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
two
years
on
each
and
that
is
still
twice
as
long
as
the
yates
case
which
was
one
year,
11
times
concurrently
and
that
is
still
in
my
judgment
an
enormously
over
broad
sentence
for
the
kind
of
contempt
that
this
record
contains.
it
is
only
the
because
of
the
fact
that
the
multiplier
of
11
is
added
that
the
seriousness
of
that
first
sentence
can
be
lost
sight
of.
a
two-year
sentence
is
itself,
one
of
the
most
severe
in
the
whole
catalog
of
criminal
contempt
sentences.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
if
the
same
sentence
were
imposed
as
a
result
of
that
and
the
statute
provided
for
a
crime
of
obstructing
justice
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
i
would
not
make
the
argument,
your
honor.
indeed,
i
make
the
point
in
this
case
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
well,
your
honor.
in
this
case,
the
pennsylvania
contempt
statute
provides
a
limit
requiring
obstruction
of
justice.
the
first
nine
counts
in
this
case
to
me
cannot
be
brought
within
the
language
of
obstructing
justice.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
they
were
insolent,
they
were
discourteous
but
they
were
not
in
any
way
blocking
the
advance
of
the
trial.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
if
you
may
your
honor,
i
take
a
very
different
view
if
we
have
a
legislature,
having
faced
the
question
and
establishing
a
statutory
parameter
to
the
permissible
sentences.
in
this
case,
we
have
no
such
legislative
judgment
to
which
either
the
state
judges
or
this
court
can
look
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
well,
your
honor
that
statute
was
passed
in
1836.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
it
has
not
been
reviewed
since
i
think
all
of
the
statutes
in
which
they
do
appear
statutory
maxima
have
been
of
more
recent
vintage
in
that.
there
has
been
nothing
prior
to
this
case
in
which
the
pennsylvania
legislature
or
any
other
legislature
could
be
given
notice
of
the
enormous
extension
of
customary
power
to
which
a
trial
judge
might
go.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
i
could
not
agree
with
you
more
your
honor,
the
requirements
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
no,
your
honor,
i
would
not.
i
would
accept
as
so
well
grounded
in
our
law
of
criminal
contempt
that
a
judge
has
within
that
very
narrow
range
of
customary
penalties
that
the
kind
of
restraint
that
this
court
referred
to
many
years
ago
in
the
anderson
case,
that
that
is
not
--
that
can
be
handled
without
the
full
panoply
of
a
trial.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
well,
i
suggested
in
the
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
i've
suggested
in
the
brief
that
a
place
to
stop
is
the
place
this
court
stopped
in
the
bloom
case,
in
regard
to
the
right
to
jury
trial.
i
do
not
think
that
is
the
right
place
to
stop.
i
do
not
subscribe
to
that.
there
was
of
course
another
jury
trial
and
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
in
light
of
de
stefano
case
your
honor,
i
think
it
would
be
futile
to
make
that
argument
now.
i
think
the
line
has
to
be
drawn
at
a
very
low
level
at
the
point
where
the
number
of
days
and
i
would
think
it
is
number
of
days,
reaches
beyond
the
stage
where
we
can
tolerate
the
total
absence
of
anything
we
call
a
trial.
and
that
it
seems
to
me
has
to
be
very
short
and
has
to
come
within
i
think
very
well
recognized
ancient
limitations.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
i
would
not
your
honor.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
yes,
indeed.
i
think
that
is
the
point
at
which
certainly
a
trial
becomes
quite
relevant,
an
impartial
judge
and
the
opportunity
to
make
the
necessary
defense
and
litigation
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
no,
your
honor.
i
would
not
even
concede
on
the
first
60
days.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
60
days
is
a
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
no.
no,
a
trial
your
honor.
this
court
has
drawn
the
limit
of
jury
trials
for
the
moment
of
six
months.
it
seems
to
me
that
at
least
one
can
say
that
six
months
is
the
line
that
which
one
is
now
clearly
entitled
for
trial.
i
think
that
is
a
necessary
almost
a
priori
argument
from
the
bloom
decision
itself
but
it
seems
to
me
that’s
way
below
six
months
before
one
can
say
that
you
have
a
penalty,
that
is
so
trivial,
so
much
a
reprimand,
so
much
within
the
ambit
of
work.
contempt
has
traditionally
lane
of
discipline
of
lawyers.
if
one
looks
at
contempt
cases,
it’s
the
lawyers
who
are
usually
the
defendants
in
contempt
cases.
in
those
cases,
the
remedies
are
as
the
appendix
in
our
brief
indicates
extremely
short,
a
matter
of
one,
two,
three
days
and
in
that
range
i
think,
the
custom
is
now
well-established
that
a
judge
can
impose
that
kind
of
sanction.
i
would
not
attempt
to
persuade
the
court
to
change
that
now
but
60
days
is
well
beyond
that
limit
your
honor.
well
beyond.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
well,
this
court
has
faced
and
i
think
well
resolved
the
problem
of
deterrence
of
persons
who
would
disturb
the
courtroom
in
the
allen
case.
there
are
many
devices
which
can
be
used
that
do
not
involve
the
imposition
of
criminal
punishments,
summarily
imposed
by
the
judge
that
can
be
used
for
deterrence,
this
is
not
the
only
deterrent.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
the
power
to
sight
for
contempt,
not
the
power
to
impose
a
contempt
sentence
and
i
think
as
justice
black’s
opinion
makes
clear
that
citation
is
a
notice
which
requires
a
subsequent
trial.
a
trial
at
which
the
defendant
as
justice
black
noted
could
again
be
disorderly.
but
i
read
nothing
in
the
allen
case
that
would
justify
summary
in
position
of
criminal
punishments
under
the
heading
of
contempt.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
in
the
allen
case,
it’s
peculiar
your
honor.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
i
would
indeed.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
i
want
to
make
just
one
point,
your
honor
and
that
is
on
the
issue
of
retroactivity
that
has
been
discussed.
miss
los
has
testified
at
some
length,
the
matter
is
not
in
the
record
which,
of
course,
her
testimony
could
not
even
be
part
of
the
trial
on
a
remand.
it
is
to
me
a
shocking
thing
to
hear
in
any
court,
1970
a
suggestion
that
even
in
1966.
no
matter
what
one
views
the
law
in
1966
to
be
that
it
would
raise
any
question
that
a
man
is
entitled
to
a
trial
on
a
punishment
that
could
produce
22
years
of
sentence.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
thank
you,
your
honor.
