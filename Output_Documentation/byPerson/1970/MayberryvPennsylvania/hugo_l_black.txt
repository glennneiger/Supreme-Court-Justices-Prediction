justice
hugo
l.
black
is
the
full
record
in
the
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it’s
a
long,
long
trial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
had
instead
of
sentencing
him
for
contempt
put
the
charge
against
him
on
the
legislative
enactment
which
provided
that
a
person
who
had
appeared
before
the
court
in
a
serious
manner
as
this
man
here
had
attempted
to
stop
it,
he
committed
a
crime,
and
tried
him,
indicted,
tried
him
before
a
jury,
given
him
a
lawyer,
given
him
all
the
protection
that
could
be
afforded.
would
you
still
argue
as
seriously
as
you
do
now,
that
that
would
violate
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
charge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that’s
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
really
is
the
basis
of
the
complaint,
isn’t
it,
not
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
section?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
perhaps
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
is
treated
as
contempt,
all
is
just
treated
as
any
other
crime.
now,
you
want
to
punish
the
man
for
doing
something
seriously
wrong.
they
should
take
fix
this
punishment
at
25
years
and
he’d
stood
up
in
this
courtroom,
decide
in
this
table
of
the
court
and
had
to
be
taken
control
of
and
it
interfered
with
the
court,
put
foul
names
in
against
it,
would
you
think
25-year
that
the
legislative
department
would
be
committing
and
violating
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
to
say
that’s
so
serious?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you’re
doing
is
talking
about
a
case
with
a
same
judge
as
a
witness
to
it
who
is
assaulted
by,
who
is
guilt
(inaudible),
tries
the
case,
is
not
a
separate
crime
where
he
is
put
before
another
judge
where
the
jury
disappears,
given
a
lawyer
and
given
all
the
protections
of
due
process
of
law
as
i
understand,
what
i
understand,
due
process
to
the
one
which
is
a
trial
in
courtroom
on
unbiased
judge
in
an
unbiased
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
have
any
idea
that
this
man
had
been
indicted
by
a
jury
or
glory
of
time
given
him
a
close
rough
trial
like
anybody
else
gets
charged
with
crime
and
there
wouldn’t
have
been
any
difficulty
of
getting
him
convicted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
a
fair
and
impartial
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
without
any
--
would
you
have
any
chance
then
to
get
an
unbiased
judge
and
an
unbiased
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
if
they
have
sentenced
him
to
life?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
agree
with
the
seriousness
of
the
crime
fully.
i
have
no
doubt
about
that,
i
don’t
worry
about
the
punishment
for
22
years,
trying
to
disturb
and
destroy
possibility
of
a
court
procedure.
the
only
thing
i'm
worried
about
it
in
the
case
is
that
the
judge
tried
him
while
he’s
having
that
puts
a
man
charged
with
the
serious
crime
ought
to
have.
that
is
a
trial
of
an
impartial
judge
and
according
to
due
process?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that’s
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that’s
going
back
to
the
saying,
well,
this
is
retroactive.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
wouldn’t
think
so
now,
would
you?
justice
