you
would
concede,
i
suppose
that
the
conduct
of
the
defendant
throughout
this
trial
was
fully
outrageous,
would
you
not?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don’t
mean
every
moment
of
the
trial
but
only
--
but
that
it
was
continually
and
quite
outrageous,
would
you?
i
mean,
don’t
we
begin
with
that
hypothesis?
justice
potter
stewart
when
he
called
the
judge
“a
stumbling
dog”,
he
called
him
a
“son
of
a
bitch”,
he
called
him
--
those
are
the
two,
that
i
remember
from
reading
the
briefs.
he
called
him
a
good
many
other
things?
justice
potter
stewart
on
court.
justice
potter
stewart
some
very
foul
language
but
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
suppose,
the
legislative
judgment
is
to
put
no
limit
on
it.
now,
you
do
have
a
statute
in
pennsylvania,
appears
on
page
2
of
your
brief
and
i
suppose
the
pennsylvania
legislature
can
be
assumed
to
be
aware
of
the
action
of
the
legislatures
in
many
other
states
as
it
put
various
limitations
on
it
and
this
one
didn’t.
isn’t
that
a
legislative
judgment?
justice
potter
stewart
whenever
it
was
passed?
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
other
hand,
mr.
reitz,
may
i
suggest,
if
in
this
summary
procedure,
the
conclusion
of
this
trial
judge
for
all
of
this
contemptuous
behavior
had
summarily
sentenced
the
fellow
for
three
days
in
jail,
would
you
find
that
objectionable
or
violation
of
any
constitutional
right?
justice

stewart
there
were
two
co-defendants,
were
there
miss

and
were
they
cited
for
you?
are

they
haven’t
--
justice

and
they
were
both
found
guilty
of
criminal
contempt,
were
they?
justice

then
what
happened
to
their
cases
in
the
pennsylvania
court?
justice
potter
stewart
the
co-defendants.
justice

stewart
what
sort
of
sentences
did
they
get?
justice

stewart
so,
they
got
6
to
12
and
7
to
14
respectively?
justice
potter
stewart
and
no
appeal?
justice
potter
stewart
is
this
very
grounded
picture
you’ve
given
us,
is
that
what
one
gets
on
the
record

were
you
at
the
trial,
