what
is
the
--
is
there
a
set
of
rule
as
to
the
scope
of
the
attorney-client
privilege
with
respect
to
agents
of
an
individual
person,
i.e.
assume
a
sole
proprietorship
and
the
proprietors
has
a
lot
of
employees,
one
of
them
is
a
truck
driver
who
is
involved
in
an
accident
and
the
truck
driver
has
a
conference
with
the
proprietor's
lawyer.
and
with
respect
to
predicted
litigation,
now
is
that
within
the
--
and
then
later
this
lawyer's
records
are
subpoena,
the
records
to
that
conference.
and
obviously
that
truck
driver
is
not
in
the
control
group
because
we're
dealing
with
the
sole
proprietorship,
is
it
settled
as
to
what
--
as
to
the
scope
of
the
attorney-client
privilege
in
that
case?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i
thought
this
was
confined
to
corporation.
justice
potter
stewart
he
might
have
his
own
lawyer
but
i'm
talking
about
the
privilege
as
between
the
sole
proprietor
and
his
lawyer
as
to?
justice
potter
stewart
in
my
case,
the
agent
has
no
control
or
whatsoever
as
to
the
decisions
to
be
made
by
the
proprietor?
justice
potter
stewart
he
is
reporting
to
the
proprietor
--
the
truck
owner's
lawyer
who
is
in
respect
to
predictable
litigation
involving
the
owner
and
the
employer.
and
so
we're
dealing
with
the
privilege
if
any
as
between
the
owner
employer
sole
proprietor
and
his
lawyer.
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
really
ask
your
view
so
much
as
does
to.
my
question
was,
is
the
law
settled
in
that
area?
justice
potter
stewart
you
do.
you
don't
see
any
distinction,
really?
justice
potter
stewart
between
whether
or
not
the
employer
is
a
corporation
or
partnership
or
sole
proprietorship,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
did
i
understand
you
say
mr.
freeman
that
this
question
is
covered
by
the
proposed
rules
of
evidence
for
the
united
states
district
courts
and
magistrates?
justice
potter
stewart
which
does
more
or
less
adopt
the
control
group
test?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
the
preliminary
draft.
does
that
suggest
at
least
the
possibility
that
the
issues
and
questions
in
this
case
might
better
be
dealt
with
by
through
canvassing
by
that
committee
and
later
adoption
or
none
adoption
by
this
court
and
by
the
congress
rather
than
any
particular
litigated
case
and
that
maybe
we
made
a
mistake
to
grant
certiorari
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
but
then
well,
of
course
first
of
all
by
approval
by
this
court,
would
they?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
that
work
is
going
on
simultaneously
under
the
rule
making
power
of
the
court
acting
it
present
to
its
committee
and
isn't
that
the
place
for
it
to
be?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
happens
to
all
the
work
that
the
committee
has
done
in
this
area?
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
prevail
and
the
court
will
decide
in
your
favor
here
and
adopt
the
proposed
rule?
justice
potter
stewart
were
the
representatives
of
the
bar
associations,
were
their
voices
heard
before
the
committee
and
trusted
with
developing
the
new
federal
rules
of
evidence?
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
the
--
is
there
a
set
of
rule
as
to
the

of
the
attorney-client
