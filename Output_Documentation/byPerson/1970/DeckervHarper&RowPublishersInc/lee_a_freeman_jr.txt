mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
this
case
arises
in
the
midst
of
several
antitrust
actions
which
have
been
brought
on
behalf
of
public
schools
and
libraries
and
parochial
schools
seeking
damages
for
an
alleged
price-fixing
conspiracy
among
numerous
publishers
and
jobbers
in
the
sale
of
library
editions
of
children's
books
to
institutional
schools
and
libraries.
this
conspiracy
is
alleged
to
have
lasted
from
1959
to
1967
when
the
defendants
entered
into
a
consent
decree
with
the
federal
government.
the
treble
damage
proceedings
on
behalf
of
the
schools
and
libraries
have
been
pending
for
approximately
three
years.
they
are
consolidated
before
judge
decker
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois
under
section
1407.
pursuant
to
order
of
court,
the
plaintiffs
initiated
extensive
discovery
efforts
taking
more
than
a
hundred
depositions
of
various
personnel
of
the
defendants.
these
efforts
to
obtain
the
evidence
and
the
facts
were
frustrated
by
the
evasion
recalcitrance
and
further
occasion
of
the
witnesses
who
the
plaintiffs
sought
to
depose.
as
the
district
court
found,
the
witnesses
were
deliberately
evasive,
the
witnesses
exhibit
a
remarkable
lack
of
memory
concerning
the
critical
advance
alleged
in
the
conspiracy.
there
was
a
great
discrepancy
between
the
grand
jury
testimony
of
these
witnesses
and
the
testimony
that
they
offered
at
deposition
four
years
later.
there
was
also
a
fend
ignorance
by
these
witnesses
concerning
the
incriminating
correspondence
they
had
either
sent
or
received.
the
laps
of
time
between
the
conclusion
of
the
federal
government's
proceedings,
the
grand
jury
investigation,
and
the
depositions
taken
in
these
treble
damage
actions
has
obscured
the
recollection
of
these
witnesses
and
has
prevented
in
frustrated
the
plaintiffs
from
getting
the
facts.
part
of
this
delay
has
been
attributable
to
the
defendants
since
this
is
the
second
time
that
the
defendants
have
sought
to
mandamus
judge
decker.
the
first
attempt
was
denied
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
certiorari
was
denied
by
this
court.
faced
with
this
problem,
the
plaintiffs
moved
for
the
production
of
what
has
been
labeled
now
debriefing
statements
which
were
taken
from
the
grand
jury
witnesses
by
defense
counsel.
it
developed
from
the
testimony
of
witnesses
that
the
defense
counsel
had
stood
outside
the
door
of
the
grand
jury
room
while
the
federal
government
was
conducting
its
grand
jury
investigation
and
as
the
witnesses
left
the
grand
jury
room,
defense
counsel
would
take
them
somewhere
else,
sit
down
and
either
with
a
tape
recorder
or
stenographer
or
with
handwritten
notes
would
asked
the
grand
jury
witnesses
what
questions
have
been
asked
by
the
grand
jury,
what
answers
they
had
given,
what
type
of
evidence
they
felt
that
grand
jury
already
possess.
as
the
affidavits
submitted
by
the
defense
counsel
show
--
this
was
an
effort
simply
to
reconstruct
the
testimony
that
had
been
given
by
the
witnesses
called
before
the
grand
jury
in
order
to
track
the
grand
jury
investigation
and
then
advise
the
corporate
client
as
to
what
had
occurred
before
the
grand
jury
and
how
best
to
meet
the
evidence
that
was
being
developed.
inherently,
this
effort
was
not
limited
to
corporate
employees
or
to
any
other
type
of
employees
of
a
particular
defendant.
this
effort
extended
over
all
of
the
grand
jury
witnesses
whatever
grand
jury
witnesses
would
consent
to
sit
down
with
counsel
and
tell
him
what
had
occurred
before
the
grand
jury.
those
statements
would
take
in
transcribe
by
the
attorneys
and
use
to
advise
their
corporate
clients.
upon
the
motion,
the
district
court
ordered
that
the
defendants
produce
these
debriefing
statements
and
that
if
any
defendant
claim
that
such
statements
were
privileged
either
under
the
attorney
personal
client
privilege,
attorney
corporate
client
privilege
or
under
the
work
product
doctrine
to
set
forth
the
precise
circumstances
and
facts
under
which
these
debriefing
statements
were
taken
and
the
basis
upon
which
the
privilege
was
claimed.
the
defendants
did
submit
descriptions
and
affidavits
concerning
the
nature
of
these
debriefing
statements,
they
appear
on
our
appendix,
and
none
of
these
affidavits
was
any
claim
made
that
the
witness
interviewed
sought
legal
advice
or
that
the
attorneys
rendered
legal
advice
to
the
witnesses
after
they
left
the
grand
jury
room.
there
was
no
evidence
from
any
of
the
affidavits
filed
by
defense
counsel
of
any
confidential
attorney-client
relationship
between
the
witnesses
interviewed
and
the
defense
counsel
who
conducted
the
grand
jury
witness
interviews.
it's
conceded,
i
believe,
on
this
record
that
these
materials
were
collected
in
order
to
advice
the
corporate
clients
as
to
the
matters
that
have
occurred
before
the
grand
jury.
on
this
record,
the
district
court
rejected
the
assertion
that
these
debriefing
statements
were
protected
by
the
personal
attorney-client
privilege
with
one
exception
where
the
defense
counsel's
affidavit
had
made
out
a
case
for
assertion
of
the
personal
attorney-client
privilege,
also
rejected
the
assertion
of
attorney
corporate
client
privilege.
holding
that
this
privilege
only
attached
to
communications
made
by
corporate
officials
having
the
authority
to
seek
legal
advice
and
to
act
upon
that
advice
on
behalf
for
the
corporation.
district
judge
further
found
good
cause,
substantial
need
for
the
production
of
these
documents
in
overruling
the
claim
or
work
product.
on
a
writ
of
mandamus,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
disturbed
the
findings
of
the
district
court
with
the
exceptions
that
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
attorney
corporate
client
privilege
should
extend
to
all
debriefing
statements
taken
from
employees
of
whatever
rank
inside
the
corporation.
our
first
point
in
this
proceeding
is
that
the
use
of
writ
of
mandamus
by
the
court
of
appeals
was
inappropriate.
in
order
and
production
of
the
grand
jury's
statements,
the
district
court
did
follow
and
apply
substantial
federal
precedent
already
on
the
books
and
applied
in
either
jurisdictions
with
philadelphia
v.
westinghouse,
garrison
versus
general
motors,
natta
v.
hogan.
the
proposed
rules
of
evidence
as
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
provided
for
a
control
group
test
precisely
identical
to
that
applied
by
judge
decker
not
only
that
but
the
law
of
illinois
in
which
this
court
sits
has
adopted
the
control
group
test.
indeed,
there
was
an
indication
in
an
opinion
by
another
panel
of
the
seventh
circuit
that
this
seventh
circuit
itself
followed
the
control
group
test
rucker
v.
wabash
railroad
speaks
in
terms
of
the
privilege
not
applying
due
to
the
fact
that
the
employees
were
not
a
sufficient
rank
to
qualify
as
spokesman
for
the
corporation
in
that
case.
the
discovery
are
simply
does
not
satisfy
the
pre-requisites
for
the
use
of
mandamus.
there
has
been
charge
here
that
the
district
court
exceeded
its
jurisdiction
or
abused
its
judicial
power.
the
most
that
can
be
claimed
is
that
the
district
court
aired
in
ruling
on
a
significant
legal
issue
within
its
jurisdiction
and
we
do
not
believe
that
the
writ
of
mandamus
should
not
be
used
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
substitute
its
judgment
on
the
disputed
question
of
law
regardless
of
the
fact
that
it
maybe
significant.
congress
has
provided
specific
circumstances
for
the
review
of
interlocutory
orders
and
a
pretrial
discovery
ruling
is
not
one
of
them.
the
opinion
as
we
cited
in
(inaudible)
expresses
a
strong
legislative
and
judicial
policy
against
piecemeal
appeals.
there
has
been
no
showing
on
this
record
that
there
will
be
any
irreparable
harm
or
any
error
that
cannot
be
corrected
in
a
normal
courts
of
appeal
resulting
from
the
production
of
these
debriefings
statement.
there
is
no
claim
that
trial
strategy
has
been
revealed,
there
is
no
claim
that
the
impressions
or
conclusions
of
counsel
have
been
turned
over.
indeed,
the
district
judge
was
very
careful
in
weighing
the
evidence
as
to
each
debriefing
statement
and
return
to
the
defendants
the
only
debriefing
statement
for
which
it
was
claimed
a
work-product
protection
in
terms
of
impressions
of
counsel
--
conclusions
of
counsel
only
in
the
one
instance
where
the
document
was
substantially
the
impressions
of
counsel
rather
than
simply
a
narration
effects.
in
that
one
instance,
the
district
judge
returned
the
document
to
counsel
asserting
the
work
product
claim.
indeed,
this
case
illustrates
the
possibility
of
abuse
that
flows
from
piecemeal
appeals
of
interlocutory
order
since
this
is
the
second
interlocutory
order
which
has
been
reviewed
and
a
case
has
been
pending
for
substantial
time.
plaintiffs
have
been
delayed
and
imputed
in
the
pursuit
or
discovery
by
these
interruptions.
we
contend
that
while
mandamus
was
not
appropriate
for
the
seventh
circuit
to
employ
and
we
ask
that
this
court
decide
that
mandamus
was
not
appropriate
as
a
matter
of
judicial
decision
supervision
that
this
court
--
the
supreme
court
should
still
undertake
to
review
the
substantive
issue
that
is
the
attorney
corporate
client
--
scope
of
the
attorney
corporate
client
privilege.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
well,
the
seventh
circuit
has
created
a
conflict
among
the
circuits
as
a
law
before
the
seventh
circuit
ruled.
the
precedent
was
all
moving
the
same
way
and
now
there
is
confusion
created
by
the
seventh
circuit's
ruling.
i
don't
think
that
confusion
could
be
raise
by
a
decision
of
mandamus
was
inappropriate.
there
will
still
be
the
pronouncement
of
accord
in
west
reporter
that
they
take
that
view
of
the
privilege.
moreover,
the
proposed
rules
of
evidence
that
are
been
now
drafted
considered
this
very
point
--
the
scope
of
the
attorney
corporate
client
privilege
and
we
believe
it's
more
appropriate
for
that
issue
to
be
decided
and
litigated
context
rather
than
passed
on
--
in
this
court's
supervisory
role
when
it
reviews
these
rules
and
submits
them
to
congress
for
approval.
of
course
we
feel
that
we're
supported
by
these
rules
and
so
proposed
draft
has
come
out
in
our
favor
and
has
adopted
to
control
group
test
as
applied
by
judge
decker.
in
short,
we
feel
that
this
case
in
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
context
that
it
was
presented
to
the
seventh
circuit
did
not
present
a
sufficiently
exceptional
circumstance
to
warrant
the
use
of
the
writ
of
the
mandamus.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
oh,
absolutely,
i
think
that
this
is
a
much
stronger
case
than
will
to
rule
of
that
mandamus
is
inappropriate.
in
will,
there
was
no
opportunity
for
the
government
to
secure
review
of
the
ruling
that
they
sought
to
review
by
the
writ
of
the
mandamus.
it's
very
similar
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
if
judge
will
ordered
the
government
to
turn
over
a
list
of
witnesses
and
the
government
said
that,
it
would
prejudice
their
case
and
subject
the
witness
the
to
possible
retaliatory
action
if
the
list
was
turned
over
and
perhaps
result
in
a
dismissal
of
the
indictment.
the
court
assumed
that
there
would
be
no
review
even
from
the
dismissal
of
indictment
still
held
mandamus
to
being
appropriate.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
well,
i
think
that's
the
issue
here.
i
don't
think
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
no,
but
in
this
--
as
you
have
stated
and
i
do
not
believe
the
--
under
the
traditional
terms
of
the
privilege
that
the
privilege
would
extend
to
that
truck
driver
unless
he
were
also
a
potential
defendant
unless
he
were
consulting
that
attorney
in
a
joint
capacity,
the
truck
driver
being
a
potential
defendant.
well,
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
no,
i
think
the
rule
would
be
exactly
the
same
for
him
--
the
partnership
or
a
corporation
depending
upon
the
size
of
the
organization
and
the
relationship
of
that
case
is
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
i
think
the
traditional
rule
is
when
you
speak
in
judicial
agency
terms.
the
agent
has
to
be
simply
a
transmitting
agent
or
necessary
to
transmit
the
information
to
the
attorney.
the
truck
driver
who
is
talking
to
the
lawyer
on
behalf
of
the
owner
of
the
truck
is
not
seeking
legal
advice
on
behalf
of
that
owner.
he
is
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
and
the
fact
that
this
truck
driver
is
an
employee
of
the
sole
proprietor,
in
our
view
makes
him
no
different
than
any
other
witness
to
the
extent
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
no,
i
don't
believe
the
law
settled
in
that
area.
i
believe
that
this
decision
would
have
an
effect
on
the
law
in
that
area
as
well.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
no.
none
in
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
that
there
is
a
distinction
in
terms
of
the
application
of
privileges
as
there
was
no
distinction
in
u.s.
v.
white
with
respect
to
the
coverage
or
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
i
believe
as
justice
murphy
held,
you
have
to
look
at
the
purpose
of
the
organization
and
whether
it
be
a
labor
union
or
trade
association
or
a
partnership
if
that
purpose
is
so
associate
with
an
individual's
purpose,
then
it
would
be
protected,
whereas
if
it
is
a
collective
purpose
or
a
business
purpose,
it
would
not
be
protected.
we
feel
that
the
control
group
test
as
applied
by
the
district
court
strikes
an
appropriate
balance
for
the
need
for
discovery
by
litigants
and
the
rational
for
the
attorney-client
privilege
of
rational
agenda
lays
a
traditional
attorney-client
privilege.
i
believe
all
commentators
recognized
that
the
privilege
results
in
a
suppression
of
information
and
needs
to
be
confine
within
the
narrowest
possible
limits
consistently
its
purpose.
a
consistence
with
its
purpose,
the
control
group
test
recognizes
the
privilege
with
respect
to
communications
to
counsel
for
the
purpose
of
securing
legal
advice
by
those
corporate
officials
having
the
authority
to
direct
the
corporate
action
taken
on
that
advice.
the
function
of
the
privilege
is
to
protect
counsel
--
to
permit
counsel
to
give
advice
to
the
client
and
for
the
client
to
act
upon
that
advice
and
we
believe
that
logically
that
provision
only
extend
to
corporate
officials
who
respond
to
the
attorney's
function
as
an
attorney,
the
person
who
acts
on
the
advice
is
therefore
protected
in
his
communication.
the
control
group
people
--
those
people
who
can
act
on
the
attorney's
advice
are
really
the
only
people
who
occupy
a
confidential
relationship
with
the
counsel.
they
are
the
people
who
seek
the
advice.
they
are
the
people
who
implement
the
advice.
the
respondents
have
argued
that
it
is
very
important
for
the
counsel
to
give
adequate
legal
advice
to
secure
all
of
the
facts
and
i
believe
this
relates
to
your
question
mr.
justice
stewart.
but
we
do
not
believe
that
the
need
to
secure
the
facts
constitute
a
rational
to
apply
the
privilege.
in
this
instance,
it
may
be
far
more
important
for
counsel
for
harper
and
row
to
secure
the
facts
from
the
witnesses
who
have
testified
from
wholesalers
as
to
the
enforcement
and
maintenance
of
this
price
conspiracy
than
to
interview
their
own
employees.
there
may
be
far
more
damaging
that
evidence
developed
before
the
grand
jury
from
other
witnesses
than
from
the
corporate
employees.
we
would
distinguish
sharply
then
the
distinction
--
the
fact-gathering
function
of
an
attorney
from
the
function
of
giving
legal
advice
and
we
believe
that
it
is
only
that
function
of
giving
legal
advice
which
authorizes
the
privilege
to
apply
that
communication.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
in
this
case,
we
are
talking
about
materials
which
have
been
assembled
by
corporate
counsel.
these
materials
reflect
factual
information
which
should
otherwise
be
available
by
the
ordinary
processes
of
discovery
that
is
from
corporate
records
or
from
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses
themselves
unlike
an
individual
that
corporation
has
no
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
accordingly,
the
plaintiff
should
be
able
to
go
forward
and
accumulate
this
evidence
from
the
oral
depositions
of
the
witnesses
and
from
review
of
the
documents
that
exist
in
a
corporate
files.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
no,
it's
much
more
than
that
mr.
justice
white
because
as
the
debriefing
memos
or
statements
which
we
received
show,
many
of
the
witnesses
did
not
tell
the
full
story
before
the
grand
jury.
many
of
the
--
the
grand
jury
did
not
explore
many
of
the
areas
which
are
significant
to
our
case.
these
are
rather
subtle
matters
and
when
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
oh
no!
well,
that's
one
of
the
purposes
conflicts
between
what
they
told
to
the
grand
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
what
they
told
to
counsel,
but
they
also
told
counsel
more
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
oh
yes!
i
bet
it
goes
to
the
good
cause
of
discovery.
i
think
that
would
be
enough
of
a
reason,
but
we
have
much
more
in
this
case.
we
have
for
instance
there
are
meetings
which
occur
every
month
among
the
publishers,
the
publisher's
sales
managers
meeting.
in
the
depositions
the
witnesses
say,
they
don't
attend
the
meetings
before
the
grand
jury.
they
go
and
say
that
they
attended
the
meetings
but
discussed
baseball.
to
their
counsel
they
go
and
say
we
all
agree
to
cut
this
jobber
off
because
it
cut
prices.
there's
a
great
difference
in
degree
between
the
versions
of
the
story
which
appear
in
depositions
in
the
grand
jury
and
in
relating
up
to
counsel.
as
well
as
the
fact
that
there's
been
a
great
laps
of
time
between
the
grand
jury
investigation
and
the
depositions
we
are
taking
in
this
case
have
been
for
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
that
would
be
the
distinction
--
the
discrepancies
between
the
grand
jury
testimony
and
the
deposition
testimony.
we
do
have
that.
we
have
the
grand
jury
minutes.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
well,
there's
two
points
that
we
need
to
explore.
we
need
to
find
out
first
whether
the
witnesses
told
the
truth
before
the
grand
jury,
whether
they
fully
elucidated
the
facts
before
the
grand
jury.
second,
we
need
to
know
what
areas
of
grand
jury
missed.
indeed,
the
debriefing
statements
which
we
called
quote
in
our
brief
illustrate
that
the
witnesses
came
out
of
the
grand
jury
and
said,
“the
examiner
was
right
to
the
point
of
asking
the
crucial
question”
but
he
didn't
ask
that
question
if
he
had
asked
that
question
whether
i
refuse
to
supply
a
discount
in
jobber.
i
would
have
had
to
answer
yes.
well,
from
that
--
from
those
kinds
of
statements
in
the
debriefing
statements.
we
can
then
proceed
and
we
depose
the
witnesses
and
either
impeach
them
or
refresh
their
recollection
with
that
information.
it's
quite
significant
to
us
in
the
context
of
this
case
where
decisions
turn
on
very
--
in
a
price
fixing
case
where
decisions
turned
very
subtle
factors
and
the
information
as
to
what
occurred
behind
closed
doors
in
a
darkened
room
among
conspirators,
what
phrases
were
used
by
these
conspirators
is
very
significant.
and
that's
why
we
need
the
debriefing
statements.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
no
and
i
think
no.
it
is
the
best
evidence
of
what
they
said
in
the
grand
jury.
it
is
not
--
the
debriefing
memos
however
are
the
best
evidence
of
what
they
withheld
or
concealed
from
the
grand
jury
and
what
they
would
have
said
in
front
of
the
grand
jury,
had
they've
been
asked
certain
question
and
this
occurred
five
years
ago.
this
occurred
in
1965,
1966,
this
occurred
when
their
memories
were
fresh.
this
occurred
when
they
were
in
less
adverse
circumstances
and
that
these
debriefing
statements
do
record
facts
which
are
not
otherwise
accessible
to
the
plaintiffs.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
yes,
that's
one
of
the
main.
yes,
that's
the
main
purpose
beyond
that,
they're
also
useful
as
discovery
tools
to
discover
what
in
fact
the
witness
knew
beyond
the
questions
asked
in
the
grand
jury.
i
believe
the
debriefing
statement
submitted
to
this
court
that
runs
24,
25
type
pages
tape
recorder
and
it
does
contain
numerous
incidents
testified
too
by
the
witness
which
were
not
explored
before
the
grand
jury.
and
these
are
things
which
in
many
instance
the
witness
can
honestly
fail
the
recall
and
many
instances,
the
witness
simply
will
not
undertake
to
recall
these
factors
in
depositions.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
oh!
it
depends
upon
the
showing
and
i
think
that
goes
to
a
good
cause.
any
discovery
of
course
is
predicated
upon
a
showing
of
good
cause.
in
this
case,
judge
decker
found
substantial
need
if
during
depositions,
the
witnesses
exhibit
the
evasiveness
recalcitrance
and
the
complete
disavowal
of
their
prior
written
communications.
then,
yes
indeed,
i
believe
we
would
be
entitled
to
see
that
this
information
which
was
collected
by
counsel
be
in
factual
information
collected
by
counsel
at
the
time
when
the
witness
was
much
more
--
much
closer
to
the
events
and
had
a
much
broader
recollection
of
the
events.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
again,
i
believe
it
would
depend
upon
the
attitude
of
the
witness
and
the
need
which
the
plaintiffs
show
for
that
information.
it
would
also
depend
upon
whether
that
information
was
available
from
other
sources,
from
other
witnesses
from
documentary
evidence.
i
think
it's
a
balancing
test
and
it's
something
that
the
district
court
would
have
to
administer
and
rule
upon.
i
don't
think
that
point
goes
to
the
privilege,
i
think
that
point
goes
to
whether
or
not
the
plaintiffs
would
be
entitled
to
secure
that
information
whether
or
not
they
had
made
a
substantial
showing.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
oh!
i
don't
think
that
would
make
any
difference
if
he
were
outside
the
control
group
as
the
control
group
has
been
defined
by
the
lower
courts.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
by
preliminary
draft
to
that
proposal
was
rule
5-03
(a).
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
which
defines
the
client
as
a
person
who
can
speak
on
behalf
of
the
corporation
--
take
action
on
behalf
of
the
corporation?
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
no,
in
both
instance
i
believe
the
canvassing
has
occurred.
i
believe
the
standing
committee
solicits
comments
from
members
of
the
bar
and
from
practicing
lawyers
and
makes
its
recommendation
to
this
court
on
the
basis
of
the
material
it's
collected.
in
this
case,
we
have
had
extensive
participation
by
amicus
curiae
and
i
believe
that
in
this
instance,
it
would
be
perfectly
appropriate
and
perhaps
even
better
for
the
court
to
decide
this
issue
in
a
litigated
context
rather
than
simply
the
rule
has
take
effect
by
the
inaction
of
congress.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
yes,
there
would
be
by
approval
of
that.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
i'm
not
certain
i
can
satisfactorily
respond
to
that
question.
i
believe
that
it's
appropriate
to
decide
it
here.
i
believe
in
hickman
v.
taylor,
the
issue
was
decided
here
and
in
hickman
v.
taylor
of
course
showed
the
way
for
later
revision
of
the
federal
rules
indeed
rule
20
--
the
newly
adopted
federal
rule
26
embodies
the
hickman
v.
taylor
ruling
on
work
product.
i
think
--
in
fact,
i
think
that
there
would
be
litigation
surrounding
the
meaning
of
the
rules
where
the
rules
to
be
promulgated
and
that
controversy
that
litigation
could
be
settled
here
without
a
necessity
of
later
judicial
controversy.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
court
could
adopt
the
rules
submitted
by
the
same
(voice
overlap).
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
yes,
since
they
both
go
the
same
way.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
excuse
me.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
i
think
the
committee
has
made
the
proper
choice
with
respect
to
its
proposal,
perhaps
at
least
in
so
far
as
i
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
yes.
i'd
like
to
save
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
to
touch
briefly
on
a
few
points,
we
submit
that
it
is
not
possible
as
defendants
wish
to
mechanically
apply
the
individual
attorney
privilege
to
the
corporate
context.
this
court
has
already
drawn
a
distinction
between
individuals
and
corporations
for
purposes
of
their
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
to
decide
the
scope
of
the
attorney
corporate-client
privilege.
we
must
look
at
the
purpose
of
the
privilege
and
if
the
purpose
of
the
privilege
is
to
encourage
frank
discloser
to
the
attorneys
that
purpose
is
not
fulfilled
by
applying
the
privilege
to
subsidiary
or
lower
issue
line
employees.
the
privilege
is
not
necessary
to
secure
reports
from
these
employees.
in
this
situation,
the
attorney
stands
in
no
different
posture
than
any
ordinary
corporate
executive.
if
the
employee
is
asked
to
submit
a
report,
he
will
submit
a
report.
the
fear
that
corporations
will
stop
employing
attorneys
or
the
attorneys
will
not
properly
prepare
their
cases
for
corporate
client
is
also
a
relatively
remote.
this
rule
has
been
in
effect
to
control
group
rule
in
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania
for
eight
years.
it
has
been
applied
throughout
the
electrical
conspiracy
cases
by
judge
kirkpatrick,
judge
ryan,
and
judge
christiansen.
it
was
applied
by
judge
fullam
in
the
philadelphia
electric
versus
anaconda
brass
case.
in
that
case,
judge
fullam
held
there
was
no
privilege
but
refused
to
disclose
the
debriefing
statements
because
he
found
there
was
no
good
cause
for
their
discovery.
indeed,
all
of
the
arguments
which
have
been
raised
by
the
defendants
in
support
of
the
privilege
are
really
arguments
which
go
to
good
cause
and
they
were
arguments
which
were
answered
by
hickman
v.
taylor.
the
idea
that
an
attorney
will
be
a
witness
against
his
client,
the
idea
that
an
attorney
will
be
a
source
of
information
for
his
adversary,
the
idea
that
discovery
of
work
product
will
reward
the
slothful
attorney
and
penalizing
industrious
attorney.
it
hasn't
happened.
it
hasn't
occurred.
courts
require
quite
a
substantial
showing
of
need
before
they
open
opposing
counsel's
files
to
their
adversaries.
and
i
think
that
is
sufficient
protection
to
all
of
the
fears
which
the
defendants
imagine.
it
really
boils
down
to
a
balancing
of
interests.
we
submit
that
contrary
to
respondents
--
defendants'
representation
the
material
is
not
otherwise
available
to
the
plaintiffs.
we
must
look
at
the
contents
of
these
debriefing
statements
to
determining
what
kind
of
material
is
being
suppressed
and
what
justification
there
is
for
applying
the
privilege
to
all
employees
when
there
are
such
strong
reasons
for
securing
this
information
to
make
a
proper
resolution
of
judicial
controversies.
thank
you.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
this
case
arises
in
the
midst
of
several
antitrust
actions
which
have
been
brought
on
behalf
of
public
schools
and
libraries
and
parochial
schools
seeking
damages
for
an
alleged
price-fixing
conspiracy
among
numerous
publishers
and
jobbers
in
the
sale
of
library
editions
of
children's
books
to
institutional
schools
and
libraries.
this
conspiracy
is
alleged
to
have
lasted
from
1959
to
1967
when
the
defendants
entered
into
a
consent
decree
with
the
federal
government.
the
treble
damage
proceedings
on
behalf
of
the
schools
and
libraries
have
been
pending
for
approximately
three
years.
they
are
consolidated
before
judge
decker
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois
under
section
1407.
pursuant
to
order
of
court,
the
plaintiffs
initiated
extensive
discovery
efforts
taking
more
than
a
hundred
depositions
of
various
personnel
of
the
defendants.
these
efforts
to
obtain
the
evidence
and
the
facts
were
frustrated
by
the
evasion
recalcitrance
and
further
occasion
of
the
witnesses
who
the
plaintiffs
sought
to
depose.
as
the
district
court
found,
the
witnesses
were
deliberately
evasive,
the
witnesses
exhibit
a
remarkable
lack
of
memory
concerning
the
critical
advance
alleged
in
the
conspiracy.
there
was
a
great
discrepancy
between
the
grand
jury
testimony
of
these
witnesses
and
the
testimony
that
they
offered
at
deposition
four
years
later.
there
was
also
a
fend
ignorance
by
these
witnesses
concerning
the
incriminating
correspondence
they
had
either
sent
or
received.
the
laps
of
time
between
the
conclusion
of
the
federal
government's
proceedings,
the
grand
jury
investigation,
and
the
depositions
taken
in
these
treble
damage
actions
has
obscured
the
recollection
of
these
witnesses
and
has
prevented
in
frustrated
the
plaintiffs
from
getting
the
facts.
part
of
this
delay
has
been
attributable
to
the
defendants
since
this
is
the
second
time
that
the
defendants
have
sought
to
mandamus
judge
decker.
the
first
attempt
was
denied
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
certiorari
was
denied
by
this
court.
faced
with
this
problem,
the
plaintiffs
moved
for
the
production
of
what
has
been
labeled
now
debriefing
statements
which
were
taken
from
the
grand
jury
witnesses
by
defense
counsel.
it
developed
from
the
testimony
of
witnesses
that
the
defense
counsel
had
stood
outside
the
door
of
the
grand
jury
room
while
the
federal
government
was
conducting
its
grand
jury
investigation
and
as
the
witnesses
left
the
grand
jury
room,
defense
counsel
would
take
them
somewhere
else,
sit
down
and
either
with
a
tape
recorder
or
stenographer
or
with
handwritten
notes
would
asked
the
grand
jury
witnesses
what
questions
have
been
asked
by
the
grand
jury,
what
answers
they
had
given,
what
type
of
evidence
they
felt
that
grand
jury
already
possess.
as
the
affidavits
submitted
by
the
defense
counsel
show
--
this
was
an
effort
simply
to
reconstruct
the
testimony
that
had
been
given
by
the
witnesses
called
before
the
grand
jury
in
order
to
track
the
grand
jury
investigation
and
then
advise
the
corporate
client
as
to
what
had
occurred
before
the
grand
jury
and
how
best
to
meet
the
evidence
that
was
being
developed.
inherently,
this
effort
was
not
limited
to
corporate
employees
or
to
any
other
type
of
employees
of
a
particular
defendant.
this
effort
extended
over
all
of
the
grand
jury
witnesses
whatever
grand
jury
witnesses
would
consent
to
sit
down
with
counsel
and
tell
him
what
had
occurred
before
the
grand
jury.
those
statements
would
take
in
transcribe
by
the
attorneys
and
use
to
advise
their
corporate
clients.
upon
the
motion,
the
district
court
ordered
that
the
defendants
produce
these
debriefing
statements
and
that
if
any
defendant
claim
that
such
statements
were
privileged
either
under
the
attorney
personal
client
privilege,
attorney
corporate
client
privilege
or
under
the
work
product
doctrine
to
set
forth
the
precise
circumstances
and
facts
under
which
these
debriefing
statements
were
taken
and
the
basis
upon
which
the
privilege
was
claimed.
the
defendants
did
submit
descriptions
and
affidavits
concerning
the
nature
of
these
debriefing
statements,
they
appear
on
our
appendix,
and
none
of
these
affidavits
was
any
claim
made
that
the
witness
interviewed
sought
legal
advice
or
that
the
attorneys
rendered
legal
advice
to
the
witnesses
after
they
left
the
grand
jury
room.
there
was
no
evidence
from
any
of
the
affidavits
filed
by
defense
counsel
of
any
confidential
attorney-client
relationship
between
the
witnesses
interviewed
and
the
defense
counsel
who
conducted
the
grand
jury
witness
interviews.
it's
conceded,
i
believe,
on
this
record
that
these
materials
were
collected
in
order
to
advice
the
corporate
clients
as
to
the
matters
that
have
occurred
before
the
grand
jury.
on
this
record,
the
district
court
rejected
the
assertion
that
these
debriefing
statements
were
protected
by
the
personal
attorney-client
privilege
with
one
exception
where
the
defense
counsel's
affidavit
had
made
out
a
case
for
assertion
of
the
personal
attorney-client
privilege,
also
rejected
the
assertion
of
attorney
corporate
client
privilege.
holding
that
this
privilege
only
attached
to
communications
made
by
corporate
officials
having
the
authority
to
seek
legal
advice
and
to
act
upon
that
advice
on
behalf
for
the
corporation.
district
judge
further
found
good
cause,
substantial
need
for
the
production
of
these
documents
in
overruling
the
claim
or
work
product.
on
a
writ
of
mandamus,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
disturbed
the
findings
of
the
district
court
with
the
exceptions
that
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
attorney
corporate
client
privilege
should
extend
to
all
debriefing
statements
taken
from
employees
of
whatever
rank
inside
the
corporation.
our
first
point
in
this
proceeding
is
that
the
use
of
writ
of
mandamus
by
the
court
of
appeals
was
inappropriate.
in
order
and
production
of
the
grand
jury's
statements,
the
district
court
did
follow
and
apply
substantial
federal
precedent
already
on
the
books
and
applied
in
either
jurisdictions
with
philadelphia
v.
westinghouse,
garrison
versus
general
motors,
natta
v.
hogan.
the
proposed
rules
of
evidence
as
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
provided
for
a
control
group
test
precisely
identical
to
that
applied
by
judge
decker
not
only
that
but
the
law
of
illinois
in
which
this
court
sits
has
adopted
the
control
group
test.
indeed,
there
was
an
indication
in
an
opinion
by
another
panel
of
the
seventh
circuit
that
this
seventh
circuit
itself
followed
the
control
group
test
rucker
v.
wabash
railroad
speaks
in
terms
of
the
privilege
not
applying
due
to
the
fact
that
the
employees
were
not
a
sufficient
rank
to
qualify
as
spokesman
for
the
corporation
in
that
case.
the
discovery
are
simply
does
not
satisfy
the
pre-requisites
for
the
use
of
mandamus.
there
has
been
charge
here
that
the
district
court
exceeded
its
jurisdiction
or
abused
its
judicial
power.
the
most
that
can
be
claimed
is
that
the
district
court
aired
in
ruling
on
a
significant
legal
issue
within
its
jurisdiction
and
we
do
not
believe
that
the
writ
of
mandamus
should
not
be
used
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
substitute
its
judgment
on
the
disputed
question
of
law
regardless
of
the
fact
that
it
maybe
significant.
congress
has
provided
specific
circumstances
for
the
review
of
interlocutory
orders
and
a
pretrial
discovery
ruling
is
not
one
of
them.
the
opinion
as
we
cited
in
(inaudible)
expresses
a
strong
legislative
and
judicial
policy
against
piecemeal
appeals.
there
has
been
no
showing
on
this
record
that
there
will
be
any
irreparable
harm
or
any
error
that
cannot
be
corrected
in
a
normal
courts
of
appeal
resulting
from
the
production
of
these
debriefings
statement.
there
is
no
claim
that
trial
strategy
has
been
revealed,
there
is
no
claim
that
the
impressions
or
conclusions
of
counsel
have
been
turned
over.
indeed,
the
district
judge
was
very
careful
in
weighing
the
evidence
as
to
each
debriefing
statement
and
return
to
the
defendants
the
only
debriefing
statement
for
which
it
was
claimed
a
work-product
protection
in
terms
of
impressions
of
counsel
--
conclusions
of
counsel
only
in
the
one
instance
where
the
document
was
substantially
the
impressions
of
counsel
rather
than
simply
a
narration
effects.
in
that
one
instance,
the
district
judge
returned
the
document
to
counsel
asserting
the
work
product
claim.
indeed,
this
case
illustrates
the
possibility
of
abuse
that
flows
from
piecemeal
appeals
of
interlocutory
order
since
this
is
the
second
interlocutory
order
which
has
been
reviewed
and
a
case
has
been
pending
for
substantial
time.
plaintiffs
have
been
delayed
and
imputed
in
the
pursuit
or
discovery
by
these
interruptions.
we
contend
that
while
mandamus
was
not
appropriate
for
the
seventh
circuit
to
employ
and
we
ask
that
this
court
decide
that
mandamus
was
not
appropriate
as
a
matter
of
judicial
decision
supervision
that
this
court
--
the
supreme
court
should
still
undertake
to
review
the
substantive
issue
that
is
the
attorney
corporate
client
--
scope
of
the
attorney
corporate
client
privilege.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
well,
the
seventh
circuit
has
created
a
conflict
among
the
circuits
as
a
law
before
the
seventh
circuit
ruled.
the
precedent
was
all
moving
the
same
way
and
now
there
is
confusion
created
by
the
seventh
circuit's
ruling.
i
don't
think
that
confusion
could
be
raise
by
a
decision
of
mandamus
was
inappropriate.
there
will
still
be
the
pronouncement
of
accord
in
west
reporter
that
they
take
that
view
of
the
privilege.
moreover,
the
proposed
rules
of
evidence
that
are
been
now
drafted
considered
this
very
point
--
the
scope
of
the
attorney
corporate
client
privilege
and
we
believe
it's
more
appropriate
for
that
issue
to
be
decided
and
litigated
context
rather
than
passed
on
--
in
this
court's
supervisory
role
when
it
reviews
these
rules
and
submits
them
to
congress
for
approval.
of
course
we
feel
that
we're
supported
by
these
rules
and
so
proposed
draft
has
come
out
in
our
favor
and
has
adopted
to
control
group
test
as
applied
by
judge
decker.
in
short,
we
feel
that
this
case
in
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
context
that
it
was
presented
to
the
seventh
circuit
did
not
present
a
sufficiently
exceptional
circumstance
to
warrant
the
use
of
the
writ
of
the
mandamus.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
oh,
absolutely,
i
think
that
this
is
a
much
stronger
case
than
will
to
rule
of
that
mandamus
is
inappropriate.
in
will,
there
was
no
opportunity
for
the
government
to
secure
review
of
the
ruling
that
they
sought
to
review
by
the
writ
of
the
mandamus.
it's
very
similar
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
if
judge
will
ordered
the
government
to
turn
over
a
list
of
witnesses
and
the
government
said
that,
it
would
prejudice
their
case
and
subject
the
witness
the
to
possible
retaliatory
action
if
the
list
was
turned
over
and
perhaps
result
in
a
dismissal
of
the
indictment.
the
court
assumed
that
there
would
be
no
review
even
from
the
dismissal
of
indictment
still
held
mandamus
to
being
appropriate.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
well,
i
think
that's
the
issue
here.
i
don't
think
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
no,
but
in
this
--
as
you
have
stated
and
i
do
not
believe
the
--
under
the
traditional
terms
of
the
privilege
that
the
privilege
would
extend
to
that
truck
driver
unless
he
were
also
a
potential
defendant
unless
he
were
consulting
that
attorney
in
a
joint
capacity,
the
truck
driver
being
a
potential
defendant.
well,
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
no,
i
think
the
rule
would
be
exactly
the
same
for
him
--
the
partnership
or
a
corporation
depending
upon
the
size
of
the
organization
and
the
relationship
of
that
case
is
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
i
think
the
traditional
rule
is
when
you
speak
in
judicial
agency
terms.
the
agent
has
to
be
simply
a
transmitting
agent
or
necessary
to
transmit
the
information
to
the
attorney.
the
truck
driver
who
is
talking
to
the
lawyer
on
behalf
of
the
owner
of
the
truck
is
not
seeking
legal
advice
on
behalf
of
that
owner.
he
is
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
and
the
fact
that
this
truck
driver
is
an
employee
of
the
sole
proprietor,
in
our
view
makes
him
no
different
than
any
other
witness
to
the
extent
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
no,
i
don't
believe
the
law
settled
in
that
area.
i
believe
that
this
decision
would
have
an
effect
on
the
law
in
that
area
as
well.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
no.
none
in
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
that
there
is
a
distinction
in
terms
of
the
application
of
privileges
as
there
was
no
distinction
in
u.s.
v.
white
with
respect
to
the
coverage
or
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
i
believe
as
justice
murphy
held,
you
have
to
look
at
the
purpose
of
the
organization
and
whether
it
be
a
labor
union
or
trade
association
or
a
partnership
if
that
purpose
is
so
associate
with
an
individual's
purpose,
then
it
would
be
protected,
whereas
if
it
is
a
collective
purpose
or
a
business
purpose,
it
would
not
be
protected.
we
feel
that
the
control
group
test
as
applied
by
the
district
court
strikes
an
appropriate
balance
for
the
need
for
discovery
by
litigants
and
the
rational
for
the
attorney-client
privilege
of
rational
agenda
lays
a
traditional
attorney-client
privilege.
i
believe
all
commentators
recognized
that
the
privilege
results
in
a
suppression
of
information
and
needs
to
be
confine
within
the
narrowest
possible
limits
consistently
its
purpose.
a
consistence
with
its
purpose,
the
control
group
test
recognizes
the
privilege
with
respect
to
communications
to
counsel
for
the
purpose
of
securing
legal
advice
by
those
corporate
officials
having
the
authority
to
direct
the
corporate
action
taken
on
that
advice.
the
function
of
the
privilege
is
to
protect
counsel
--
to
permit
counsel
to
give
advice
to
the
client
and
for
the
client
to
act
upon
that
advice
and
we
believe
that
logically
that
provision
only
extend
to
corporate
officials
who
respond
to
the
attorney's
function
as
an
attorney,
the
person
who
acts
on
the
advice
is
therefore
protected
in
his
communication.
the
control
group
people
--
those
people
who
can
act
on
the
attorney's
advice
are
really
the
only
people
who
occupy
a
confidential
relationship
with
the
counsel.
they
are
the
people
who
seek
the
advice.
they
are
the
people
who
implement
the
advice.
the
respondents
have
argued
that
it
is
very
important
for
the
counsel
to
give
adequate
legal
advice
to
secure
all
of
the
facts
and
i
believe
this
relates
to
your
question
mr.
justice
stewart.
but
we
do
not
believe
that
the
need
to
secure
the
facts
constitute
a
rational
to
apply
the
privilege.
in
this
instance,
it
may
be
far
more
important
for
counsel
for
harper
and
row
to
secure
the
facts
from
the
witnesses
who
have
testified
from
wholesalers
as
to
the
enforcement
and
maintenance
of
this
price
conspiracy
than
to
interview
their
own
employees.
there
may
be
far
more
damaging
that
evidence
developed
before
the
grand
jury
from
other
witnesses
than
from
the
corporate
employees.
we
would
distinguish
sharply
then
the
distinction
--
the
fact-gathering
function
of
an
attorney
from
the
function
of
giving
legal
advice
and
we
believe
that
it
is
only
that
function
of
giving
legal
advice
which
authorizes
the
privilege
to
apply
that
communication.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
in
this
case,
we
are
talking
about
materials
which
have
been
assembled
by
corporate
counsel.
these
materials
reflect
factual
information
which
should
otherwise
be
available
by
the
ordinary
processes
of
discovery
that
is
from
corporate
records
or
from
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses
themselves
unlike
an
individual
that
corporation
has
no
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
accordingly,
the
plaintiff
should
be
able
to
go
forward
and
accumulate
this
evidence
from
the
oral
depositions
of
the
witnesses
and
from
review
of
the
documents
that
exist
in
a
corporate
files.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
no,
it's
much
more
than
that
mr.
justice
white
because
as
the
debriefing
memos
or
statements
which
we
received
show,
many
of
the
witnesses
did
not
tell
the
full
story
before
the
grand
jury.
many
of
the
--
the
grand
jury
did
not
explore
many
of
the
areas
which
are
significant
to
our
case.
these
are
rather
subtle
matters
and
when
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
oh
no!
well,
that's
one
of
the
purposes
conflicts
between
what
they
told
to
the
grand
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
what
they
told
to
counsel,
but
they
also
told
counsel
more
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
oh
yes!
i
bet
it
goes
to
the
good
cause
of
discovery.
i
think
that
would
be
enough
of
a
reason,
but
we
have
much
more
in
this
case.
we
have
for
instance
there
are
meetings
which
occur
every
month
among
the
publishers,
the
publisher's
sales
managers
meeting.
in
the
depositions
the
witnesses
say,
they
don't
attend
the
meetings
before
the
grand
jury.
they
go
and
say
that
they
attended
the
meetings
but
discussed
baseball.
to
their
counsel
they
go
and
say
we
all
agree
to
cut
this
jobber
off
because
it
cut
prices.
there's
a
great
difference
in
degree
between
the
versions
of
the
story
which
appear
in
depositions
in
the
grand
jury
and
in
relating
up
to
counsel.
as
well
as
the
fact
that
there's
been
a
great
laps
of
time
between
the
grand
jury
investigation
and
the
depositions
we
are
taking
in
this
case
have
been
for
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
that
would
be
the
distinction
--
the
discrepancies
between
the
grand
jury
testimony
and
the
deposition
testimony.
we
do
have
that.
we
have
the
grand
jury
minutes.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
well,
there's
two
points
that
we
need
to
explore.
we
need
to
find
out
first
whether
the
witnesses
told
the
truth
before
the
grand
jury,
whether
they
fully
elucidated
the
facts
before
the
grand
jury.
second,
we
need
to
know
what
areas
of
grand
jury
missed.
indeed,
the
debriefing
statements
which
we
called
quote
in
our
brief
illustrate
that
the
witnesses
came
out
of
the
grand
jury
and
said,
“the
examiner
was
right
to
the
point
of
asking
the
crucial
question”
but
he
didn't
ask
that
question
if
he
had
asked
that
question
whether
i
refuse
to
supply
a
discount
in
jobber.
i
would
have
had
to
answer
yes.
well,
from
that
--
from
those
kinds
of
statements
in
the
debriefing
statements.
we
can
then
proceed
and
we
depose
the
witnesses
and
either
impeach
them
or
refresh
their
recollection
with
that
information.
it's
quite
significant
to
us
in
the
context
of
this
case
where
decisions
turn
on
very
--
in
a
price
fixing
case
where
decisions
turned
very
subtle
factors
and
the
information
as
to
what
occurred
behind
closed
doors
in
a
darkened
room
among
conspirators,
what
phrases
were
used
by
these
conspirators
is
very
significant.
and
that's
why
we
need
the
debriefing
statements.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
no
and
i
think
no.
it
is
the
best
evidence
of
what
they
said
in
the
grand
jury.
it
is
not
--
the
debriefing
memos
however
are
the
best
evidence
of
what
they
withheld
or
concealed
from
the
grand
jury
and
what
they
would
have
said
in
front
of
the
grand
jury,
had
they've
been
asked
certain
question
and
this
occurred
five
years
ago.
this
occurred
in
1965,
1966,
this
occurred
when
their
memories
were
fresh.
this
occurred
when
they
were
in
less
adverse
circumstances
and
that
these
debriefing
statements
do
record
facts
which
are
not
otherwise
accessible
to
the
plaintiffs.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
yes,
that's
one
of
the
main.
yes,
that's
the
main
purpose
beyond
that,
they're
also
useful
as
discovery
tools
to
discover
what
in
fact
the
witness
knew
beyond
the
questions
asked
in
the
grand
jury.
i
believe
the
debriefing
statement
submitted
to
this
court
that
runs
24,
25
type
pages
tape
recorder
and
it
does
contain
numerous
incidents
testified
too
by
the
witness
which
were
not
explored
before
the
grand
jury.
and
these
are
things
which
in
many
instance
the
witness
can
honestly
fail
the
recall
and
many
instances,
the
witness
simply
will
not
undertake
to
recall
these
factors
in
depositions.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
oh!
it
depends
upon
the
showing
and
i
think
that
goes
to
a
good
cause.
any
discovery
of
course
is
predicated
upon
a
showing
of
good
cause.
in
this
case,
judge
decker
found
substantial
need
if
during
depositions,
the
witnesses
exhibit
the
evasiveness
recalcitrance
and
the
complete
disavowal
of
their
prior
written
communications.
then,
yes
indeed,
i
believe
we
would
be
entitled
to
see
that
this
information
which
was
collected
by
counsel
be
in
factual
information
collected
by
counsel
at
the
time
when
the
witness
was
much
more
--
much
closer
to
the
events
and
had
a
much
broader
recollection
of
the
events.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
again,
i
believe
it
would
depend
upon
the
attitude
of
the
witness
and
the
need
which
the
plaintiffs
show
for
that
information.
it
would
also
depend
upon
whether
that
information
was
available
from
other
sources,
from
other
witnesses
from
documentary
evidence.
i
think
it's
a
balancing
test
and
it's
something
that
the
district
court
would
have
to
administer
and
rule
upon.
i
don't
think
that
point
goes
to
the
privilege,
i
think
that
point
goes
to
whether
or
not
the
plaintiffs
would
be
entitled
to
secure
that
information
whether
or
not
they
had
made
a
substantial
showing.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
oh!
i
don't
think
that
would
make
any
difference
if
he
were
outside
the
control
group
as
the
control
group
has
been
defined
by
the
lower
courts.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
by
preliminary
draft
to
that
proposal
was
rule
5-03
(a).
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
which
defines
the
client
as
a
person
who
can
speak
on
behalf
of
the
corporation
--
take
action
on
behalf
of
the
corporation?
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
no,
in
both
instance
i
believe
the
canvassing
has
occurred.
i
believe
the
standing
committee
solicits
comments
from
members
of
the
bar
and
from
practicing
lawyers
and
makes
its
recommendation
to
this
court
on
the
basis
of
the
material
it's
collected.
in
this
case,
we
have
had
extensive
participation
by
amicus
curiae
and
i
believe
that
in
this
instance,
it
would
be
perfectly
appropriate
and
perhaps
even
better
for
the
court
to
decide
this
issue
in
a
litigated
context
rather
than
simply
the
rule
has
take
effect
by
the
inaction
of
congress.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
yes,
there
would
be
by
approval
of
that.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
i'm
not
certain
i
can
satisfactorily
respond
to
that
question.
i
believe
that
it's
appropriate
to
decide
it
here.
i
believe
in
hickman
v.
taylor,
the
issue
was
decided
here
and
in
hickman
v.
taylor
of
course
showed
the
way
for
later
revision
of
the
federal
rules
indeed
rule
20
--
the
newly
adopted
federal
rule
26
embodies
the
hickman
v.
taylor
ruling
on
work
product.
i
think
--
in
fact,
i
think
that
there
would
be
litigation
surrounding
the
meaning
of
the
rules
where
the
rules
to
be
promulgated
and
that
controversy
that
litigation
could
be
settled
here
without
a
necessity
of
later
judicial
controversy.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
court
could
adopt
the
rules
submitted
by
the
same
(voice
overlap).
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
yes,
since
they
both
go
the
same
way.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
excuse
me.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
i
think
the
committee
has
made
the
proper
choice
with
respect
to
its
proposal,
perhaps
at
least
in
so
far
as
i
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
yes.
i'd
like
to
save
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
to
touch
briefly
on
a
few
points,
we
submit
that
it
is
not
possible
as
defendants
wish
to
mechanically
apply
the
individual
attorney
privilege
to
the
corporate
context.
this
court
has
already
drawn
a
distinction
between
individuals
and
corporations
for
purposes
of
their
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
to
decide
the
scope
of
the
attorney
corporate-client
privilege.
we
must
look
at
the
purpose
of
the
privilege
and
if
the
purpose
of
the
privilege
is
to
encourage
frank
discloser
to
the
attorneys
that
purpose
is
not
fulfilled
by
applying
the
privilege
to
subsidiary
or
lower
issue
line
employees.
the
privilege
is
not
necessary
to
secure
reports
from
these
employees.
in
this
situation,
the
attorney
stands
in
no
different
posture
than
any
ordinary
corporate
executive.
if
the
employee
is
asked
to
submit
a
report,
he
will
submit
a
report.
the
fear
that
corporations
will
stop
employing
attorneys
or
the
attorneys
will
not
properly
prepare
their
cases
for
corporate
client
is
also
a
relatively
remote.
this
rule
has
been
in
effect
to
control
group
rule
in
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania
for
eight
years.
it
has
been
applied
throughout
the
electrical
conspiracy
cases
by
judge
kirkpatrick,
judge
ryan,
and
judge
christiansen.
it
was
applied
by
judge
fullam
in
the
philadelphia
electric
versus
anaconda
brass
case.
in
that
case,
judge
fullam
held
there
was
no
privilege
but
refused
to
disclose
the
debriefing
statements
because
he
found
there
was
no
good
cause
for
their
discovery.
indeed,
all
of
the
arguments
which
have
been
raised
by
the
defendants
in
support
of
the
privilege
are
really
arguments
which
go
to
good
cause
and
they
were
arguments
which
were
answered
by
hickman
v.
taylor.
the
idea
that
an
attorney
will
be
a
witness
against
his
client,
the
idea
that
an
attorney
will
be
a
source
of
information
for
his
adversary,
the
idea
that
discovery
of
work
product
will
reward
the
slothful
attorney
and
penalizing
industrious
attorney.
it
hasn't
happened.
it
hasn't
occurred.
courts
require
quite
a
substantial
showing
of
need
before
they
open
opposing
counsel's
files
to
their
adversaries.
and
i
think
that
is
sufficient
protection
to
all
of
the
fears
which
the
defendants
imagine.
it
really
boils
down
to
a
balancing
of
interests.
we
submit
that
contrary
to
respondents
--
defendants'
representation
the
material
is
not
otherwise
available
to
the
plaintiffs.
we
must
look
at
the
contents
of
these
debriefing
statements
to
determining
what
kind
of
material
is
being
suppressed
and
what
justification
there
is
for
applying
the
privilege
to
all
employees
when
there
are
such
strong
reasons
for
securing
this
information
to
make
a
proper
resolution
of
judicial
controversies.
thank
you.
