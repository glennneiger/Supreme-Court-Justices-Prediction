what
you
really
want
do
is
to
match
up
their
grand
jury
testimony
of
what
they
told
their
lawyers
in
these
so-called
debriefing
statements?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
would
you
say
as
to
first
who
had
not
testified
before
the
grand
jury
and
who
you
with
good
reason
would
suspect
that
the
lawyers
or
the
defendants
who
want
interview,
do
you
think
you
can
get
his
statement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
supposing
the
witness
gets
to
understand
as
the
first
analogy
you
have
that
he
is
going
to
be
a
witness
against
you
and
he
testifies
and
then
you
say,
“did
you
testify
for
the
grand
jury?”
he
said
“no.”
do
you
make
a
statement
to
your
lawyer?
yes.
could
you
get
that
statement?”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
should've
added
one
in
my
--
one
thing
in
my
hypothetical
that
the
witness
was
an
employee
of
the
corporation.
