justice

white
that
was
a
bill
of
particulars,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
freeman,
i
thought
perhaps
all
you
want
to
find
out
was
what
these
witnesses
testified
to
before
the
grand
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
purpose
is
just
isn't
to
pick
up
conflicts
between
what
the
witnesses
said
to
the
grand
jury
and
what
they
told
to
counsel?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
enough?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
that
be
enough
reason?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
it
true
that
he
did
permit
the
production
of
some
of
the
debriefing
statements?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
and
those
are
in
the
record
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
those
were
submitted
sealed
to
the
judge,
he
made
his
ruling
but
the
ones
that
were
ordered
produced
are
now
available?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they're
now
available?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
suggest
that
the
contents
of
those
debriefing
statements
in
terms
of
what
they
cover
and
what
they
don't
cover
are
irrelevant
to
decision
of
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
what
goes
in
the
deciding
whether
the
privilege
would?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
know
then
whether
the
bar
association
says
--
the
association's
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
brown,
an
employee
of
a
corporation
or
the
employee
of
an
individual
certainly
anticipates
that
he
might
be
called
as
a
witness
and
is
sued
against
his
employer
and
his
employer
knows
that
too,
i
suppose.
and
if
he
has
some
relevant
information,
he
knows
that
he
is
going
to
have
to
testify
(voice
overlap)
and
will
have
to
tell
and
will
have
to
swear
to
tell
the
truth
and
is
suppose
to
tell
the
truth.
and
if
he
knows
that
he's
going
to
tell
on
the
stand
the
true
story,
obviously,
it's
going
to
be
same
story
he's
going
to
tell
his
lawyer.
now,
what's
the
big
problem?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
still
ask
you
(voice
overlap)
what's
the
significance
of
the
privilege?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
all
may
be
true
but
the
problems
only
going
to
come
up
isn't
it
when
there
might
be
a
variation
between
what
the
employee
would
tell
counsel
and
what
he
would
he
say
on
the
stand,
is
that
what
worries
people
or?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
that
and
i
have
read
that
before,
but
what
--
again,
just
tell
me
what
deterrent
effect
is
there
going
to
be
on
an
employee
in
communicating
with
counsel
which
seems
to
be
the
main
point
here?
what
does
guaranteed
practice
are
going
to
be
if
he
anticipates
that
he's
going
to
be
a
witness,
he's
going
to
have
to
tell
the
truth
on
the
stand?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
really
in
some
way
as
you
think
a
handmaid
and
other
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
maybe?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
none
of
the
values,
none
of
the
same
values
underlie
the
attorney-client
privilege
you
have?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
the
reason.
the
reasons
are
the
values
that
underlie
the
privilege.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
are
those
values
that
underlie
the
attorney-client
privilege
that
you're
talking
about
that
indicate
that
although
he
is
going
to
have
to
say
the
same
thing
on
the
stand
nevertheless
the
lawyer
shouldn't
have
to
say
what
he
told
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it's
a
--
it's
really
as
much
of
this
argument
goes
to
the
impact
on
counsel
as
on
the
client?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
values
are
there,
i
would
think
it
would
be
help
to
restate
them
which
you're
now
doing?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
welcome
those
that
and
your
point
and
when
your
point
is
that
you
don't
think
you
want
to
be
a
built-in
an
impeachment
mechanism
for
the
opposition?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
really
suggesting
that
this
is
in
respect
to
privilege?
you
really
are
talking
about
a
contraction
of
an
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
may
i
ask
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
corporate
president
interviewed
the
sales
manager
and
makes
a
memorandum
of
it,
is
that
something
of
discovery?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
the
lawyer
does
the
interviewing
and
writes
a
memorandum,
he
gives
to
the
president
that's
not
so
self-discriminating?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
necessarily.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
a
bill
of
particulars,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron

white
mr.

perhaps
all

is
that
enough?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
that
be
enough
reason?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
it
true
that
he
did
permit
the
production
of
some
of
the
debriefing
statements?
justice
byron

white
yes
and
those

justice
byron

white
mr.

an

of

certainly
anticipates
that
he
might
be

and
if

on
the
stand
the
true
story,
obviously,
it's
going
to
be
same
story
he's
going
to
tell
his
lawyer.
now,
what's
the
big
problem?
justice
byron

white
well,
i
still
ask
you
(voice

what's
the

that

that's
the
reason.
the
reasons
are
the
values
