mr.
h.
templeton
brown
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
afraid
that
i
agree
with
counsel
for
petitioners
on
only
two
points.
i
do
agree
that
this
issue
should
be
decided
by
this
court
in
the
context
of
litigated
matter
rather
than
by
a
committee.
i
further
agree
that
the
application
of
the
attorney-client
privilege
applies
with
equal
force
to
an
agent
whether
it
be
the
agent
of
a
sole
proprietor,
partnership,
an
association,
or
a
corporation.
at
the
outset,
i
should
state
that
many
of
the
statements,
if
not
most
of
the
factual
statements
made
by
mr.
freeman
have
been
made
out
of
context
and
have
no
relevance
to
the
issue
that
is
presented
to
this
court.
the
ruling
made
by
judge
decker
was
made
purely
on
the
basis
of
a
ruling
of
law.
none
of
the
facts
that
are
involved
in
the
controversy
had
anything
to
do
with
his
ruling.
he
also
ruled
in
other
areas
such
as
whether
or
not
there
was
good
cause
to
grant
the
production
of
grand
jury
minutes.
and
whether
or
not
the
attorney
--
whether
or
not
the
work
product
rule
applied,
and
whether
or
not
there
was
personal
attorney-client
privilege.
none
of
those
were
germane
to
the
question
that
is
presented
here.
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
i
think
there
may
have
been
--
well,
there
may
have
been
a
limited
number
to
which
an
objection
was
raised.
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
both
would
be.
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
there
was
no
objection
to
those.
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
that's
correct
and
the
other
--
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
oh!
yes,
i
would.
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
well,
in
the
first
place
it
seems
to
me
that
an
attorney-client
privilege
has
to
be
determined
at
the
time
that
a
communication
takes
place.
there
is
no
such
question
despite
that
argument
by
mr.
freeman.
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
well,
i
would
like
come
to
that
in
the
course
of
my
argument
that
the
question
is
what
the
--
what
is
the
nature
of
the
communication
under
what
circumstances
as
the
communication
had?
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
privilege?
does
the
attachment
of
the
privilege
protect
the
interest
of
the
public?
these
matters
are
not
matters.
this
is
not
the
work
product
doctrine.
this
isn't
the
question
of
changing
of
an
after
the
fact
decision
based
from
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
a
good
cause.
this
is
a
completely
different
animal.
and
as
i
say
the
decision
of
judge
decker
that
is
the
decision
that
is
brought
before
here
for
consideration
by
you
is
purely
a
question
of
law
and
what
happened
in
that
court
is
not
in
any
sense
germane
remain
to
his
decision
or
to
importance
of
the
decision
here.
now,
i
suppose
every
case
has
its
extreme
importance
to
the
attorneys
were
involved
in
my
owner
remarks
will
have
to
be
view
accordingly.
the
widespread
concern
of
the
bar
however,
over
the
outcome
of
this
proceeding
as
evidenced
by
the
amicus
briefs
filed
by
the
american
bar
association
and
other
prominent
bar
associations.
i
think
it
gives
compelling
evidence
that
the
decision
of
this
court
will
have
a
very
significant
effect
from
the
manner
in
which
corporate
legal
representation
or
hereafter
be
conducted
in
this
country.
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
well,
let
me
advert
to
that
mr.
justice
white.
the
draft
that
you
heard
was
a
preliminary
draft
of
a
proposed
rule.
now,
i
do
not
know
what
comments
have
been
received
by
the
committee
since
that
time,
but
the
preliminary
draft
of
proposed
rule
is
a
far
cry
from
the
drafting
of
a
rule.
and
i
am
certain
that
the
committee
has
had
--
has
been
flooded
with
comments
and
since
that
date,
nothing
further
has
come
out.
however,
the
view
of
the
bar
which
appears
to
be
a
unanimous
view
as
indicated
by
the
association
of
the
bar
of
new
york,
the
american
bar
association,
the
illinois
bar
association,
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
and
others
would
indicate
that
as
far
as
the
bar
is
concerned,
a
completely
different
and
contrary
review
was
held.
of
course
i
--
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
well,
i
think
that
they
have
but
i
--
it
would
be
really
a
hearsay
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
as
to
what
they've
done.
i
have
not
participated
myself
in
any
action
taken
by
the
bar
association
in
connection
with
the
committee.
i
understand
the
positions
have
been
taken
and
that
they
are
rather
drastically
opposed
to
the
preliminary
draft
to
the
proposed
rule.
of
course
personally,
i
tend
to
approach
this
in
the
standpoint
of
a
practicing
attorney
who
for
about
45
years
has
been
rendering
legal
advice
to
clients
and
protecting
them
in
their
interest
in
court
and
before
administrative
agencies,
and
i
look
at
it
from
a
practical
rather
than
from
a
theoretical
viewpoint.
i
think
that
they
put
the
question
in
proper
context
namely,
what
is
the
application
of
this
privilege
to
a
corporation?
i
have
to
devote
a
few
moment
to
a
discussion
of
what
the
origin
and
nature
of
the
privilege
is.
of
course,
the
attorney-client
privilege
is
not
a
rigid
and
flexible
rule
of
evidence
or
of
law.
it's
a
rule
founded
upon
justice
and
reason
which
has
accommodated
itself
and
must
continue
to
accommodate
itself
to
changing
conditions.
when
it
was
first
to
enunciated,
so
about
300
years
ago,
it
was
a
privilege
available
only
to
the
attorney.
as
early
as
1801
however,
it
was
stated
by
lord
eldon
to
be
the
privilege
of
the
client
and
the
public
and
so
it's
been
come
to
be
regarded
ever
since
a
privilege
protecting
not
only
the
interest
of
the
client
but
the
interest
of
the
public
as
well.
originally,
it
was
a
privilege
limited
to
pending
litigation
then
to
contemplated
litigation
then
to
other
litigation
and
as
it
accommodated
itself
to
expanding
conditions
it
finally
became
a
protection
to
legal
advice
without
limitation.
now,
originally,
it
was
directed
toward
communications
between
an
attorney
and
an
individual
client
and
the
reason
is
obvious.
in
the
16th
and
17th
centuries,
there
was
very
little
but
individual
clients.
again,
it
has
accommodated
itself
in
this
respect
to
a
changing
world
and
it
has
become
increasingly
directed
toward
the
protection
of
confidential
information
between
an
attorney
and
a
corporate
client.
i
think
the
reason
for
this
recent
direction
becomes
clear
when
consideration
is
given
to
the
question
of
just
what
the
purpose
of
the
privilege
is
and
just
how
that
purpose
can
be
best
accomplished.
the
purpose
i
would
judge
is
undisputed.
it
is
universally
accepted
not
only
in
this
country
but
in
all
other
countries
of
the
civilized
world
of
whose
judicial
systems
i
have
any
knowledge
that
it
is
in
the
interest
of
the
public,
that
every
person
whether
an
individual,
an
association,
or
a
corporation
should
be
encouraged
to
seek
professional
advice
in
the
guidance
of
its
affairs.
that
with
a
benefit
of
such
advice,
he
will
be
more
up
to
conform
his
conduct
whether
a
personal
or
corporate
to
the
standards
imposed
by
society.
i
think
it's
further
generally
accepted
that
in
order
to
accomplish
this
subjective
communications
between
a
attorney
and
client,
whether
verbal
or
in
writing,
must
be
free
and
uninhibited
for
human
nature
being
what
it
is,
what
it
has
always
has
been
and
what
i
suppose
it
always
will
be
depending
the
coming
of
the
millennium.
the
ordinary
individual
seeking
legal
advice
or
providing
information
upon
which
legal
advice
will
be
predicated
either
for
him
or
for
his
or
for
a
corporate
employer.
he
will
be
more
willing
to
speak
freely
knowing
that
the
attorney
cannot
be
required
to
become
an
informer
against
him.
if
he
knows
that
he
is
protected
by
the
attorney-client
privilege
and
the
communication
must
be
held
in
confidence.
today,
as
everyone
knows
the
corporations
are
exhuming
and
ever
expanding
role
in
our
society.
today,
a
corporation
is
supposed
to
do
more
than
provide
a
good
product
and
profits
for
its
stockholders.
it's
supposed
to
have
an
interest
in
the
protection
of
the
environment
and
the
protection
of
civil
rights
and
in
other
matters
that
are
important
to
common
welfare.
it
certainly,
is
no
less
important
that
a
corporation
been
formed
its
actions
which
have
greater
rate
today
than
the
actions
of
individuals
to
the
laws
of
the
land
and
then
the
best
interest
of
society
then
that
the
individual
do
so.
now,
this
general
acceptance
of
this
proposition
is
well
established.
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
mr.
freeman,
sr.
is
the
only
person
who
has
ever
sought
to
contest
the
propriety
of
the
application
of
the
attorney-client
privilege
to
a
corporation.
he
did
that
in
1962
and
we
happen
to
be
on
opposite
sides
of
the
table
of
that
time
as
well.
his
effort
however
met
short
shrift
at
that
the
hands
of
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
the
case
american
gas
--
radiant
burners
versus
american
gas
association
certiorari
denied
by
this
court
in
1963.
today,
counsel
concedes
though,
i
think
it
is
with
obvious
reluctance,
that
there
has
to
be
an
attorney
or
at
least
not
has
to
be,
i
overstate,
that
there
is
an
attorney-client
privilege
of
some
sort.
but
they
would
render
it
wholly
important
with
the
restriction
which
has
suggested
namely
that
an
attorney
be
permitted
to
communicate
in
confidence
with
only
a
miniscule
number
of
persons
in
any
corporation
forming
what
is
described
as
the
control
group.
counsel
argues
that
to
go
further
would
constitute
an
extension
of
the
privilege.
he
relies
basically
on
the
decision
of
judge
kirkpatrick
and
the
case
of
city
of
philadelphia
versus
westinghouse.
however,
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
fact.
the
control
group
test
when
enunciated
by
judge
kirkpatrick
in
1963,
sprung
full-blown
from
his
own
draft.
prior
to
that
date,
it
was
known
to
neither
man
nor
court.
on
the
contrary,
the
rule
as
advocated
by
the
respondents
here,
have
been
consistently
applied
prior
thereto.
i
think
it
is
important
that
neither
judge
kirkpatrick
nor
any
of
the
limited
number
of
courts
which
have
followed
him
nor
counsel
here
have
given
any
rationalization
of
the
application
of
the
control
group
test.
i
think
you
will
find
that
every
argument
that
has
been
made
to
date
is
an
argument
against
the
propriety
of
the
attorney-client
privilege
itself
rather
than
a
limitation
of
its
application.
in
none
of
the
cases
cited
by
petitioners
was
any
analysis
made
of
the
results
which
could
be
expected
to
flow
from
the
adoption
of
those
test.
the
question
is
to
whether
or
not
it
would
affect
the
giving
of
professional
advice
and
the
interest
of
the
public
in
making
sure
that
that
advice
was
given.
furthermore,
none
of
the
cases
following
the
kirkpatrick
decision
was
the
validity
of
the
control
group
test
even
a
contested
issue
with
the
possible
exception
of
a
day
case
in
illinois
where
the
court
opinion
doesn't
make
the
position
of
the
parties
entirely
clear.
the
question
and
each
of
these
cases
was
merely
whether
assuming
the
validity
of
the
control
group
test,
it
could
properly
be
applied
to
the
communications
which
were
there
under
consideration.
it
would
appear
to
me
that
judge
kirkpatrick's
opinion
appears
to
have
resulted
from
the
giving
of
an
undue
emphasis
to
the
giving
of
advice
as
oppose
or
rather
than
the
obtaining
of
information
and
the
feeling
that
advice
need
be
given
only
to
the
limited
group
dictating
policy.
the
likelihood
that
a
limited
group
of
people
may
dictate
over
all
policy
in
a
corporation
is
--
i
can
see
to
be
of
no
significance
as
far
as
the
interest
of
the
public
in
having
every
employee
through
whom
a
corporation
acts
and
with
full
knowledge
of
the
law
and
the
consequences
of
its
own
action.
now,
the
control
group
test
would
make
it
impossible
not
only
to
receive
information
from
the
employee,
but
to
give
advice
to
the
employee.
this
is
directly
contrary
to
the
law
as
it
has
been
known
and
i
think
perhaps
at
this
juncture
i
might
answer
the
question
of
mr.
justice
white
asked.
this
is
what
dean
wigmore
has
to
say
with
respect
to
the
availability
of
the
privilege
to
an
agent.
he
says,
“this
of
course
includes
communications
through
an
interpreter
and
also
communications
through
a
messenger
or
any
other
agent
of
transmission
as
well
as
communications
originating
with
the
client,
agents
it
made
to
the
attorney.”
as
far
as
i
know,
no
one
has
here
before
ever
taken
the
position
that
there
was
any
distinction
between
the
agent
of
a
sole
proprietor
or
a
partnership
and
the
agent
of
a
corporation.
the
--
it
is
inconceivable
to
me
that
in
the
interest
of
the
public,
there
could
be
any
distinction.
if
it
is
in
the
interest
of
the
public
that
every
person
in
a
--
that
every
person
act
with
full
knowledge
of
the
consequences
of
its
action,
then
why
should
the
protection
of
the
privilege
be
limited
only
to
a
very
small
number.
why
should
it
be
denied
to
the
person
who
made
the
most
in
need
of
the
advice?
now,
you
may
say
that,
maybe
you
argued
that
if
you
give
the
advice
to
a
president,
it
ultimately
filters
down
through
challenge
of
communication
and
ultimately
gets
in
some
form
to
the
person
not
on
the
firing
line
who
needs
the
--
really
needs
the
information
to
conform
his
action
and
the
actions
of
persons
whose
action
he
is
directing.
but
if
the
advice
is
to
--
if
the
privileges
of
value
and
the
advices
of
value,
then
the
advice
should
be
available
in
the
form
in
which
it
is
most
effective.
and
i
do
not
see
how
anyone
could
argue
that
advice
given
to
the
president
of
a
company
has
more
to
do
with
the
action
taken
by
sales
manager
who
was
in
charge
of
a
sales
group
than
the
advice
given
directly
to
the
sales
manager
where
he
can
ask
questions
or
he
can
an
get
interpretation
where
he
really
knows
what
the
significance
of
the
advice
is.
if
the
attorney-client
privilege
has
any
value,
it
has
value
on
an
ever
expanding
and
broader
scale
and
not
on
an
ever
limiting
and
small
scale.
if
the
information
given
to
an
attorney
is
obtained
by
an
employee
in
the
course
of
and
as
a
result
of
his
employment,
i
can
see
no
legal,
logical
or
practical
reason
why
the
position
occupied
by
the
employee
or
the
extent
of
his
ability
to
dictate
the
use
to
be
made
of
a
resulting
opinion
should
be
a
matter
of
any
importance
or
should
be
a
matter
of
significance
as
far
as
the
public
interest
is
concerned.
if
it
is
well
informed
the
advice
that
a
person
should
have
then
that
advice
should
be
obtained
from
the
source
where
it
is
best
and
most
accurately
available.
i
think
it's
apparent
that
the
president
of
a
large
company
very
rarely
knows
the
details
of
the
day-to-day
operations
of
the
company.
this
is
information
that
you
ordinarily
would
have
to
collect
from
my
number
of
broadly
based
sources.
the
salesman
or
the
sales
manager
may
best
know
whether
or
not
there
are
pricing
practices
which
may
be
suspect
under
the
robinson-patman
act
whether
those
prices
may
be
justified
on
the
basis
of
meeting
of
competition
or
something
else.
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
well,
i
would
say
mr.
justice
white
that
if
the
matter
is
a
simple
as
the
one
that
you
stated
that
you
might
just
as
well
discard
the
attorney-client
privilege.
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
alright.
the
significance,
it
seems
to
me
is
this.
i'll
speak
from
the
basis
of
the
experience,
if
i'm
trying
to
study
the
pricing
practices
of
a
company
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
may
be
some
implications
under
let's
say
reciprocal
trade
relation
problems.
formerly
considered
to
present
no
problem
not
considered
to
present
a
problem
that
is
yet
unresolved
or
if
i'm
looking
at
a
robinson-patman
act
question,
i
don't
just
ask
the
employee
a
simple
question
recount
to
me
what
you
did
or
that.
you
act
more
as
much
as
an
inquisitor
as
you
do
as
subscribe,
this
is
a
very
large
part
--
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
well,
let
me
--
i
think
that
the
best
thing
i
can
do
your
honor
is
to
refer
to
authority
that
i
have
always
considered
to
be
very
persuasive
to
me.
in
u.s.
versus
louisville
and
nashville
railroad
company,
this
court
said,
“the
desirability
of
protecting
confidential
communications
between
attorney
and
client
as
a
matter
of
public
policy
is
too
well-known
and
has
been
too
often
recognized
by
textbooks
and
courts
to
need
extended
comment
now.”
if
such
a
communications
were
required
to
be
made
the
subject
of
examination
and
publication
such
enactment
would
be
a
practical
prohibition
upon
professional
advice
and
assistance.
and
that's
--
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
i
don't
--
i
think
as
i
said
before
that
this
gets
back
the
way
question
of
human
nature
as
much
as
anything
else
and
regardless
of
how
human
should
act.
i
am
quite
certain
from
my
own
experience
that
they
do
not
talk
as
freely
and
as
candidly
if
they
feel
that
the
communication
is
not
privileged
as
they
would
otherwise
do.
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
no,
i
do
not.
i
think
that
the
privilege
against
--
well,
let
me
say
that
they
have
been
discussed
together
but
as
far
as
i'm
concern
they're
entirely
separate
things
--
entirely
separate.
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
well,
some
of
the
same
values
underlie
it.
yes,
but
as
far
as
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
is
concerned
it
obviously
doesn't
apply
to
a
corporation.
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
if
you
say
that
the
privilege
against
the
self
--
if
you
take
the
argument
it
seems
to
me
or
the
question,
i
beg
your
pardon,
that's
been
propounded
to
me
and
carried
what's
logical
extreme
then
what's
the
value,
why
should
you
have
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
if
the
employee
is
going
to
have
to
except
in
the
criminal
case
(voice
overlap)
why
--
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
well,
and
that's
precisely
what
i
think
is
true
here
and
this
is
--
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
well,
i'll
be
perfectly
frank.
if
i
felt
that
every
time
that
i
spoke
to
an
employee
or
to
a
client
that
i
recognize
that
at
some
future
date,
i
could
be
place
on
the
stand
that
my
deposition
be
taken
and
i
ask
mr.
brown,
“what
did
you
say?
what
was
said
to
you?”
it
may
cover
a
platter
of
subjects
because
in
the
course
of
a
deposition
you
are
not
strictly
limited
as
to
questions
of
relevance
say
this
is
a
search
for
information.
if
i
felt
that
that
were
--
the
way
that
i
were
going
to
have
to
practice,
i
would
find
that
very
difficult.
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
i
did
not
intend
to
mean
that
--
intend
to
mean
it
as
such
because
i
think
that
if
i
do
not
feel
free.
i
mean
i
hope
that
i
am
of
some
benefit
to
my
clients
that
it
isn't
just
a
question
of
protection
after
the
fact
after
something
has
been
done.
i
think
that
any
good
attorney
hopes
that
his
advice
acts
a
prophylactic
as
well
as
a
defense.
and
i
do
not
think
that
i
would
be
on
an
equal
position
to
accomplish
that
without
the
protection
of
attorney-client
privilege.
i
just
--
to
me
it's
inconceivable
that
a
person
should
be
required
to
supply
his
adversary
with
the
paid
investigator.
that's
what
it
amounts
to
because
you
are
proving
not
only
the
information
that
he
receives,
you're
proving
the
advice
that
he
gets.
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
i
am
saying
that
and
i
have
thought
that
this
was
generally
recognized.
i
have
thought
that
the
value
of
the
privilege
was
no
longer
open
to
question
and
that
the
only
question
to
was
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
yes,
well.
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
i
certainly
do
not.
i
would
find
that
very
distasteful.
maybe
i
don't
have
too
long
to
practice
so
it
won't
bother
as
much
as
some
of
my
younger
friends.
furthermore,
of
course
this
would
leave
a
corporation
in
the
anomalous
position
of
being
responsible
for
the
actions
of
its
employees,
having
their
information
imputative
and
yet
not
being
able
to
get
in
confidence.
the
information
of
that
would
enable
the
corporation
to
control
its
activities.
i
can
see
that
my
time
is
becoming
somewhat
limited
so
i'll
leap
to
as
much
as
i
can
of
what
remains.
counsel
has
both
on
brief
and
here
suggested
problems
that
he
feels
would
be
created
by
an
extension
on
the
privilege.
now,
bear
in
mind
actually
i
thought
what
we
were
arguing
here
was
the
question
of
extension
of
the
privilege.
it
is
quite
apparent
that
we
really
are
getting
back
to
the
genesis
of
it
and
the
basis
of
it.
but
these
are
largely,
i
would
say,
completely
without
substance
and
the
figments
largely
of
counsel's
imagination.
the
argument
has
made
that
this
would
somehow
suppress
evidence.
it
doesn't
suppress
anything,
every
scrap
of
information
that
an
employee
has
before
the
communication
remains
available
thereafter.
if
--
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
i
am
talking
about,
that's
correct.
i
misspoke
myself.
i
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
what
i
was
trying
to
say
was
that
obviously
the
privilege
itself
suppresses
no
information
that
every
scrap
of
information
that
a
person
has
before
remains
available.
every
document
that
he
has
that
the
corporation
has
that
he
has
any
knowledge
of
is
--
remains
available.
every
avenue
of
discovery
that
existed
prior
to
the
time
of
the
communication
remains
open.
i'll
skip
over
a
part
of
what
i
have
in
mind.
i
think
i've
already
adverted
to
the
opinion
of
the
court.
counsel
makes
the
point
that
in
his
opinion
that
the
restriction
of
the
privilege
which
he
seeks
would
not
place
any
impediment
on
the
way
of
securing
legal
advice
and
it
won't
discourage
its
use.
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
agree
100%
with
the
former
opinion
of
the
supreme
court.
i
think
that
it
would
--
that
it
would
absolute,
they
will
have
a
very
great
impediment.
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
certainly.
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
certainly.
it's
only
the
communication
that
might
never
have
taken
place
but
for
the
existence
of
the
privilege.
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
that
is
not.
unless,
that
oh
there
are
qualifications
obviously.
if
it's
waived
or
if
it's
on
a
factual
matter
rather
than
a
legal
matter,
there
are
these
various
exceptions
but
basically
that's
entirely
true.
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
not
at
all,
sir.
i
think
that
there
are
some
suggestions
or
inferences
which
the
counsel
has
made
which
get
into
the
factual
area
that
under
the
antitrust
laws
there
should
be
some
exception
to
the
general
rule.
now,
neither
this
nor
any
of
the
other
factual
statements
had
anything
to
do
with
the
opinion
below.
as
i
have
indicated,
the
factual
statements
that
were
made
by
judge
decker
related
to
his
ruling
on
the
release
of
grand
jury
minutes
of
the
--
his
finding
on
the
work
product
doctrine
and
his
finding
on
a
personal
attorney-client
privilege.
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
well,
i
have
to
touch
it
very
briefly
obviously
and
i
have
to
rely
for
a
more
detail
discussion
on
the
brief.
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
i
will
state
about
five
things.
i
think
that
the
importance
of
the
question
is
made
clear
as
indicated
by
the
interests
of
the
attorneys
throughout
the
country
in
the
various
bar
associations.
there
was
no
other
effective
remedy
that
was
available
in
this
instance.
the
court
below
not
only
refuse
to
certify
but
refuse
to
return
the
impounded
documents
so
that
had
respondents
chose
him
to,
they
could've
refuse
to
produce
them
and
gone
up
under
contempt.
obviously,
a
--
that
is
obviously
a
ruling
after
the
documents
were
released
would
not
be
an
adequate
remedy
the
information
is
gone.
if
even
more
importance
to
me,
failure
to
review
the
order
of
the
trial
court
would
have
left
unresolved
in
the
event
of
a
verdict
for
the
defendants
or
a
settlement
an
issue
which
was
stated
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
have
substantial
importance
to
the
administration
of
justice.
i
think
also
particularly
compelling
as
the
fact
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
radiant
burners
in
1963
cited
with
approval
the
decisions
of
judges
leahy
and
wyzanski
and
the
zenith
radio
and
united
shoe
machinery
cases
stating
that
in
those
cases,
the
problem
posed
“where
a
corporation
must
act
through
its
officers
and
employees
was
competently
met.”
in
both
of
those
decisions,
the
privilege
was
held
to
protect
communications
between
an
attorney
and
employees
of
a
corporation
who
were
not
claimed
to
be.
and
in
fact,
obviously
were
not
members
of
a
control
group.
an
appellate
court
generally
has
it
within
its
power
to
grant
mandamus
and
exceptional
situations
and
i
would
say
that
assuredly
that
power
exist
for
its
exercise
for
the
purpose
of
compelling
a
lower
court
to
adhere
the
principles
which
the
appellate
court
has
enunciated.
i
see
the
warning
sign
and
in
closing,
may
i
say
that
i
consider
this
to
be
as
an
important
argument.
it
has
ever
been
my
privilege
to
make
and
i
only
trust
--
i
have
adequately
presented
the
position
of
the
many
attorneys
who
through
their
bar
associations
and
have
shown
their
concern
and
the
resolution
of
an
issue
which
in
their
opinion
will
have
a
very
serious
barring
upon
their
ability
to
serve
the
best
interests
of
their
clients
and
of
society.
thank
you.
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
afraid
that
i
agree
with
counsel
for
petitioners
on
only
two
points.
i
do
agree
that
this
issue
should
be
decided
by
this
court
in
the
context
of
litigated
matter
rather
than
by
a
committee.
i
further
agree
that
the
application
of
the
attorney-client
privilege
applies
with
equal
force
to
an
agent
whether
it
be
the
agent
of
a
sole
proprietor,
partnership,
an
association,
or
a
corporation.
at
the
outset,
i
should
state
that
many
of
the
statements,
if
not
most
of
the
factual
statements
made
by
mr.
freeman
have
been
made
out
of
context
and
have
no
relevance
to
the
issue
that
is
presented
to
this
court.
the
ruling
made
by
judge
decker
was
made
purely
on
the
basis
of
a
ruling
of
law.
none
of
the
facts
that
are
involved
in
the
controversy
had
anything
to
do
with
his
ruling.
he
also
ruled
in
other
areas
such
as
whether
or
not
there
was
good
cause
to
grant
the
production
of
grand
jury
minutes.
and
whether
or
not
the
attorney
--
whether
or
not
the
work
product
rule
applied,
and
whether
or
not
there
was
personal
attorney-client
privilege.
none
of
those
were
germane
to
the
question
that
is
presented
here.
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
i
think
there
may
have
been
--
well,
there
may
have
been
a
limited
number
to
which
an
objection
was
raised.
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
both
would
be.
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
there
was
no
objection
to
those.
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
that's
correct
and
the
other
--
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
oh!
yes,
i
would.
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
well,
in
the
first
place
it
seems
to
me
that
an
attorney-client
privilege
has
to
be
determined
at
the
time
that
a
communication
takes
place.
there
is
no
such
question
despite
that
argument
by
mr.
freeman.
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
well,
i
would
like
come
to
that
in
the
course
of
my
argument
that
the
question
is
what
the
--
what
is
the
nature
of
the
communication
under
what
circumstances
as
the
communication
had?
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
privilege?
does
the
attachment
of
the
privilege
protect
the
interest
of
the
public?
these
matters
are
not
matters.
this
is
not
the
work
product
doctrine.
this
isn't
the
question
of
changing
of
an
after
the
fact
decision
based
from
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
a
good
cause.
this
is
a
completely
different
animal.
and
as
i
say
the
decision
of
judge
decker
that
is
the
decision
that
is
brought
before
here
for
consideration
by
you
is
purely
a
question
of
law
and
what
happened
in
that
court
is
not
in
any
sense
germane
remain
to
his
decision
or
to
importance
of
the
decision
here.
now,
i
suppose
every
case
has
its
extreme
importance
to
the
attorneys
were
involved
in
my
owner
remarks
will
have
to
be
view
accordingly.
the
widespread
concern
of
the
bar
however,
over
the
outcome
of
this
proceeding
as
evidenced
by
the
amicus
briefs
filed
by
the
american
bar
association
and
other
prominent
bar
associations.
i
think
it
gives
compelling
evidence
that
the
decision
of
this
court
will
have
a
very
significant
effect
from
the
manner
in
which
corporate
legal
representation
or
hereafter
be
conducted
in
this
country.
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
well,
let
me
advert
to
that
mr.
justice
white.
the
draft
that
you
heard
was
a
preliminary
draft
of
a
proposed
rule.
now,
i
do
not
know
what
comments
have
been
received
by
the
committee
since
that
time,
but
the
preliminary
draft
of
proposed
rule
is
a
far
cry
from
the
drafting
of
a
rule.
and
i
am
certain
that
the
committee
has
had
--
has
been
flooded
with
comments
and
since
that
date,
nothing
further
has
come
out.
however,
the
view
of
the
bar
which
appears
to
be
a
unanimous
view
as
indicated
by
the
association
of
the
bar
of
new
york,
the
american
bar
association,
the
illinois
bar
association,
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
and
others
would
indicate
that
as
far
as
the
bar
is
concerned,
a
completely
different
and
contrary
review
was
held.
of
course
i
--
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
well,
i
think
that
they
have
but
i
--
it
would
be
really
a
hearsay
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
as
to
what
they've
done.
i
have
not
participated
myself
in
any
action
taken
by
the
bar
association
in
connection
with
the
committee.
i
understand
the
positions
have
been
taken
and
that
they
are
rather
drastically
opposed
to
the
preliminary
draft
to
the
proposed
rule.
of
course
personally,
i
tend
to
approach
this
in
the
standpoint
of
a
practicing
attorney
who
for
about
45
years
has
been
rendering
legal
advice
to
clients
and
protecting
them
in
their
interest
in
court
and
before
administrative
agencies,
and
i
look
at
it
from
a
practical
rather
than
from
a
theoretical
viewpoint.
i
think
that
they
put
the
question
in
proper
context
namely,
what
is
the
application
of
this
privilege
to
a
corporation?
i
have
to
devote
a
few
moment
to
a
discussion
of
what
the
origin
and
nature
of
the
privilege
is.
of
course,
the
attorney-client
privilege
is
not
a
rigid
and
flexible
rule
of
evidence
or
of
law.
it's
a
rule
founded
upon
justice
and
reason
which
has
accommodated
itself
and
must
continue
to
accommodate
itself
to
changing
conditions.
when
it
was
first
to
enunciated,
so
about
300
years
ago,
it
was
a
privilege
available
only
to
the
attorney.
as
early
as
1801
however,
it
was
stated
by
lord
eldon
to
be
the
privilege
of
the
client
and
the
public
and
so
it's
been
come
to
be
regarded
ever
since
a
privilege
protecting
not
only
the
interest
of
the
client
but
the
interest
of
the
public
as
well.
originally,
it
was
a
privilege
limited
to
pending
litigation
then
to
contemplated
litigation
then
to
other
litigation
and
as
it
accommodated
itself
to
expanding
conditions
it
finally
became
a
protection
to
legal
advice
without
limitation.
now,
originally,
it
was
directed
toward
communications
between
an
attorney
and
an
individual
client
and
the
reason
is
obvious.
in
the
16th
and
17th
centuries,
there
was
very
little
but
individual
clients.
again,
it
has
accommodated
itself
in
this
respect
to
a
changing
world
and
it
has
become
increasingly
directed
toward
the
protection
of
confidential
information
between
an
attorney
and
a
corporate
client.
i
think
the
reason
for
this
recent
direction
becomes
clear
when
consideration
is
given
to
the
question
of
just
what
the
purpose
of
the
privilege
is
and
just
how
that
purpose
can
be
best
accomplished.
the
purpose
i
would
judge
is
undisputed.
it
is
universally
accepted
not
only
in
this
country
but
in
all
other
countries
of
the
civilized
world
of
whose
judicial
systems
i
have
any
knowledge
that
it
is
in
the
interest
of
the
public,
that
every
person
whether
an
individual,
an
association,
or
a
corporation
should
be
encouraged
to
seek
professional
advice
in
the
guidance
of
its
affairs.
that
with
a
benefit
of
such
advice,
he
will
be
more
up
to
conform
his
conduct
whether
a
personal
or
corporate
to
the
standards
imposed
by
society.
i
think
it's
further
generally
accepted
that
in
order
to
accomplish
this
subjective
communications
between
a
attorney
and
client,
whether
verbal
or
in
writing,
must
be
free
and
uninhibited
for
human
nature
being
what
it
is,
what
it
has
always
has
been
and
what
i
suppose
it
always
will
be
depending
the
coming
of
the
millennium.
the
ordinary
individual
seeking
legal
advice
or
providing
information
upon
which
legal
advice
will
be
predicated
either
for
him
or
for
his
or
for
a
corporate
employer.
he
will
be
more
willing
to
speak
freely
knowing
that
the
attorney
cannot
be
required
to
become
an
informer
against
him.
if
he
knows
that
he
is
protected
by
the
attorney-client
privilege
and
the
communication
must
be
held
in
confidence.
today,
as
everyone
knows
the
corporations
are
exhuming
and
ever
expanding
role
in
our
society.
today,
a
corporation
is
supposed
to
do
more
than
provide
a
good
product
and
profits
for
its
stockholders.
it's
supposed
to
have
an
interest
in
the
protection
of
the
environment
and
the
protection
of
civil
rights
and
in
other
matters
that
are
important
to
common
welfare.
it
certainly,
is
no
less
important
that
a
corporation
been
formed
its
actions
which
have
greater
rate
today
than
the
actions
of
individuals
to
the
laws
of
the
land
and
then
the
best
interest
of
society
then
that
the
individual
do
so.
now,
this
general
acceptance
of
this
proposition
is
well
established.
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
mr.
freeman,
sr.
is
the
only
person
who
has
ever
sought
to
contest
the
propriety
of
the
application
of
the
attorney-client
privilege
to
a
corporation.
he
did
that
in
1962
and
we
happen
to
be
on
opposite
sides
of
the
table
of
that
time
as
well.
his
effort
however
met
short
shrift
at
that
the
hands
of
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
the
case
american
gas
--
radiant
burners
versus
american
gas
association
certiorari
denied
by
this
court
in
1963.
today,
counsel
concedes
though,
i
think
it
is
with
obvious
reluctance,
that
there
has
to
be
an
attorney
or
at
least
not
has
to
be,
i
overstate,
that
there
is
an
attorney-client
privilege
of
some
sort.
but
they
would
render
it
wholly
important
with
the
restriction
which
has
suggested
namely
that
an
attorney
be
permitted
to
communicate
in
confidence
with
only
a
miniscule
number
of
persons
in
any
corporation
forming
what
is
described
as
the
control
group.
counsel
argues
that
to
go
further
would
constitute
an
extension
of
the
privilege.
he
relies
basically
on
the
decision
of
judge
kirkpatrick
and
the
case
of
city
of
philadelphia
versus
westinghouse.
however,
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
fact.
the
control
group
test
when
enunciated
by
judge
kirkpatrick
in
1963,
sprung
full-blown
from
his
own
draft.
prior
to
that
date,
it
was
known
to
neither
man
nor
court.
on
the
contrary,
the
rule
as
advocated
by
the
respondents
here,
have
been
consistently
applied
prior
thereto.
i
think
it
is
important
that
neither
judge
kirkpatrick
nor
any
of
the
limited
number
of
courts
which
have
followed
him
nor
counsel
here
have
given
any
rationalization
of
the
application
of
the
control
group
test.
i
think
you
will
find
that
every
argument
that
has
been
made
to
date
is
an
argument
against
the
propriety
of
the
attorney-client
privilege
itself
rather
than
a
limitation
of
its
application.
in
none
of
the
cases
cited
by
petitioners
was
any
analysis
made
of
the
results
which
could
be
expected
to
flow
from
the
adoption
of
those
test.
the
question
is
to
whether
or
not
it
would
affect
the
giving
of
professional
advice
and
the
interest
of
the
public
in
making
sure
that
that
advice
was
given.
furthermore,
none
of
the
cases
following
the
kirkpatrick
decision
was
the
validity
of
the
control
group
test
even
a
contested
issue
with
the
possible
exception
of
a
day
case
in
illinois
where
the
court
opinion
doesn't
make
the
position
of
the
parties
entirely
clear.
the
question
and
each
of
these
cases
was
merely
whether
assuming
the
validity
of
the
control
group
test,
it
could
properly
be
applied
to
the
communications
which
were
there
under
consideration.
it
would
appear
to
me
that
judge
kirkpatrick's
opinion
appears
to
have
resulted
from
the
giving
of
an
undue
emphasis
to
the
giving
of
advice
as
oppose
or
rather
than
the
obtaining
of
information
and
the
feeling
that
advice
need
be
given
only
to
the
limited
group
dictating
policy.
the
likelihood
that
a
limited
group
of
people
may
dictate
over
all
policy
in
a
corporation
is
--
i
can
see
to
be
of
no
significance
as
far
as
the
interest
of
the
public
in
having
every
employee
through
whom
a
corporation
acts
and
with
full
knowledge
of
the
law
and
the
consequences
of
its
own
action.
now,
the
control
group
test
would
make
it
impossible
not
only
to
receive
information
from
the
employee,
but
to
give
advice
to
the
employee.
this
is
directly
contrary
to
the
law
as
it
has
been
known
and
i
think
perhaps
at
this
juncture
i
might
answer
the
question
of
mr.
justice
white
asked.
this
is
what
dean
wigmore
has
to
say
with
respect
to
the
availability
of
the
privilege
to
an
agent.
he
says,
“this
of
course
includes
communications
through
an
interpreter
and
also
communications
through
a
messenger
or
any
other
agent
of
transmission
as
well
as
communications
originating
with
the
client,
agents
it
made
to
the
attorney.”
as
far
as
i
know,
no
one
has
here
before
ever
taken
the
position
that
there
was
any
distinction
between
the
agent
of
a
sole
proprietor
or
a
partnership
and
the
agent
of
a
corporation.
the
--
it
is
inconceivable
to
me
that
in
the
interest
of
the
public,
there
could
be
any
distinction.
if
it
is
in
the
interest
of
the
public
that
every
person
in
a
--
that
every
person
act
with
full
knowledge
of
the
consequences
of
its
action,
then
why
should
the
protection
of
the
privilege
be
limited
only
to
a
very
small
number.
why
should
it
be
denied
to
the
person
who
made
the
most
in
need
of
the
advice?
now,
you
may
say
that,
maybe
you
argued
that
if
you
give
the
advice
to
a
president,
it
ultimately
filters
down
through
challenge
of
communication
and
ultimately
gets
in
some
form
to
the
person
not
on
the
firing
line
who
needs
the
--
really
needs
the
information
to
conform
his
action
and
the
actions
of
persons
whose
action
he
is
directing.
but
if
the
advice
is
to
--
if
the
privileges
of
value
and
the
advices
of
value,
then
the
advice
should
be
available
in
the
form
in
which
it
is
most
effective.
and
i
do
not
see
how
anyone
could
argue
that
advice
given
to
the
president
of
a
company
has
more
to
do
with
the
action
taken
by
sales
manager
who
was
in
charge
of
a
sales
group
than
the
advice
given
directly
to
the
sales
manager
where
he
can
ask
questions
or
he
can
an
get
interpretation
where
he
really
knows
what
the
significance
of
the
advice
is.
if
the
attorney-client
privilege
has
any
value,
it
has
value
on
an
ever
expanding
and
broader
scale
and
not
on
an
ever
limiting
and
small
scale.
if
the
information
given
to
an
attorney
is
obtained
by
an
employee
in
the
course
of
and
as
a
result
of
his
employment,
i
can
see
no
legal,
logical
or
practical
reason
why
the
position
occupied
by
the
employee
or
the
extent
of
his
ability
to
dictate
the
use
to
be
made
of
a
resulting
opinion
should
be
a
matter
of
any
importance
or
should
be
a
matter
of
significance
as
far
as
the
public
interest
is
concerned.
if
it
is
well
informed
the
advice
that
a
person
should
have
then
that
advice
should
be
obtained
from
the
source
where
it
is
best
and
most
accurately
available.
i
think
it's
apparent
that
the
president
of
a
large
company
very
rarely
knows
the
details
of
the
day-to-day
operations
of
the
company.
this
is
information
that
you
ordinarily
would
have
to
collect
from
my
number
of
broadly
based
sources.
the
salesman
or
the
sales
manager
may
best
know
whether
or
not
there
are
pricing
practices
which
may
be
suspect
under
the
robinson-patman
act
whether
those
prices
may
be
justified
on
the
basis
of
meeting
of
competition
or
something
else.
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
well,
i
would
say
mr.
justice
white
that
if
the
matter
is
a
simple
as
the
one
that
you
stated
that
you
might
just
as
well
discard
the
attorney-client
privilege.
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
alright.
the
significance,
it
seems
to
me
is
this.
i'll
speak
from
the
basis
of
the
experience,
if
i'm
trying
to
study
the
pricing
practices
of
a
company
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
may
be
some
implications
under
let's
say
reciprocal
trade
relation
problems.
formerly
considered
to
present
no
problem
not
considered
to
present
a
problem
that
is
yet
unresolved
or
if
i'm
looking
at
a
robinson-patman
act
question,
i
don't
just
ask
the
employee
a
simple
question
recount
to
me
what
you
did
or
that.
you
act
more
as
much
as
an
inquisitor
as
you
do
as
subscribe,
this
is
a
very
large
part
--
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
well,
let
me
--
i
think
that
the
best
thing
i
can
do
your
honor
is
to
refer
to
authority
that
i
have
always
considered
to
be
very
persuasive
to
me.
in
u.s.
versus
louisville
and
nashville
railroad
company,
this
court
said,
“the
desirability
of
protecting
confidential
communications
between
attorney
and
client
as
a
matter
of
public
policy
is
too
well-known
and
has
been
too
often
recognized
by
textbooks
and
courts
to
need
extended
comment
now.”
if
such
a
communications
were
required
to
be
made
the
subject
of
examination
and
publication
such
enactment
would
be
a
practical
prohibition
upon
professional
advice
and
assistance.
and
that's
--
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
i
don't
--
i
think
as
i
said
before
that
this
gets
back
the
way
question
of
human
nature
as
much
as
anything
else
and
regardless
of
how
human
should
act.
i
am
quite
certain
from
my
own
experience
that
they
do
not
talk
as
freely
and
as
candidly
if
they
feel
that
the
communication
is
not
privileged
as
they
would
otherwise
do.
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
no,
i
do
not.
i
think
that
the
privilege
against
--
well,
let
me
say
that
they
have
been
discussed
together
but
as
far
as
i'm
concern
they're
entirely
separate
things
--
entirely
separate.
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
well,
some
of
the
same
values
underlie
it.
yes,
but
as
far
as
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
is
concerned
it
obviously
doesn't
apply
to
a
corporation.
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
if
you
say
that
the
privilege
against
the
self
--
if
you
take
the
argument
it
seems
to
me
or
the
question,
i
beg
your
pardon,
that's
been
propounded
to
me
and
carried
what's
logical
extreme
then
what's
the
value,
why
should
you
have
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
if
the
employee
is
going
to
have
to
except
in
the
criminal
case
(voice
overlap)
why
--
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
well,
and
that's
precisely
what
i
think
is
true
here
and
this
is
--
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
well,
i'll
be
perfectly
frank.
if
i
felt
that
every
time
that
i
spoke
to
an
employee
or
to
a
client
that
i
recognize
that
at
some
future
date,
i
could
be
place
on
the
stand
that
my
deposition
be
taken
and
i
ask
mr.
brown,
“what
did
you
say?
what
was
said
to
you?”
it
may
cover
a
platter
of
subjects
because
in
the
course
of
a
deposition
you
are
not
strictly
limited
as
to
questions
of
relevance
say
this
is
a
search
for
information.
if
i
felt
that
that
were
--
the
way
that
i
were
going
to
have
to
practice,
i
would
find
that
very
difficult.
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
i
did
not
intend
to
mean
that
--
intend
to
mean
it
as
such
because
i
think
that
if
i
do
not
feel
free.
i
mean
i
hope
that
i
am
of
some
benefit
to
my
clients
that
it
isn't
just
a
question
of
protection
after
the
fact
after
something
has
been
done.
i
think
that
any
good
attorney
hopes
that
his
advice
acts
a
prophylactic
as
well
as
a
defense.
and
i
do
not
think
that
i
would
be
on
an
equal
position
to
accomplish
that
without
the
protection
of
attorney-client
privilege.
i
just
--
to
me
it's
inconceivable
that
a
person
should
be
required
to
supply
his
adversary
with
the
paid
investigator.
that's
what
it
amounts
to
because
you
are
proving
not
only
the
information
that
he
receives,
you're
proving
the
advice
that
he
gets.
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
i
am
saying
that
and
i
have
thought
that
this
was
generally
recognized.
i
have
thought
that
the
value
of
the
privilege
was
no
longer
open
to
question
and
that
the
only
question
to
was
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
yes,
well.
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
i
certainly
do
not.
i
would
find
that
very
distasteful.
maybe
i
don't
have
too
long
to
practice
so
it
won't
bother
as
much
as
some
of
my
younger
friends.
furthermore,
of
course
this
would
leave
a
corporation
in
the
anomalous
position
of
being
responsible
for
the
actions
of
its
employees,
having
their
information
imputative
and
yet
not
being
able
to
get
in
confidence.
the
information
of
that
would
enable
the
corporation
to
control
its
activities.
i
can
see
that
my
time
is
becoming
somewhat
limited
so
i'll
leap
to
as
much
as
i
can
of
what
remains.
counsel
has
both
on
brief
and
here
suggested
problems
that
he
feels
would
be
created
by
an
extension
on
the
privilege.
now,
bear
in
mind
actually
i
thought
what
we
were
arguing
here
was
the
question
of
extension
of
the
privilege.
it
is
quite
apparent
that
we
really
are
getting
back
to
the
genesis
of
it
and
the
basis
of
it.
but
these
are
largely,
i
would
say,
completely
without
substance
and
the
figments
largely
of
counsel's
imagination.
the
argument
has
made
that
this
would
somehow
suppress
evidence.
it
doesn't
suppress
anything,
every
scrap
of
information
that
an
employee
has
before
the
communication
remains
available
thereafter.
if
--
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
i
am
talking
about,
that's
correct.
i
misspoke
myself.
i
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
what
i
was
trying
to
say
was
that
obviously
the
privilege
itself
suppresses
no
information
that
every
scrap
of
information
that
a
person
has
before
remains
available.
every
document
that
he
has
that
the
corporation
has
that
he
has
any
knowledge
of
is
--
remains
available.
every
avenue
of
discovery
that
existed
prior
to
the
time
of
the
communication
remains
open.
i'll
skip
over
a
part
of
what
i
have
in
mind.
i
think
i've
already
adverted
to
the
opinion
of
the
court.
counsel
makes
the
point
that
in
his
opinion
that
the
restriction
of
the
privilege
which
he
seeks
would
not
place
any
impediment
on
the
way
of
securing
legal
advice
and
it
won't
discourage
its
use.
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
agree
100%
with
the
former
opinion
of
the
supreme
court.
i
think
that
it
would
--
that
it
would
absolute,
they
will
have
a
very
great
impediment.
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
certainly.
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
certainly.
it's
only
the
communication
that
might
never
have
taken
place
but
for
the
existence
of
the
privilege.
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
that
is
not.
unless,
that
oh
there
are
qualifications
obviously.
if
it's
waived
or
if
it's
on
a
factual
matter
rather
than
a
legal
matter,
there
are
these
various
exceptions
but
basically
that's
entirely
true.
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
not
at
all,
sir.
i
think
that
there
are
some
suggestions
or
inferences
which
the
counsel
has
made
which
get
into
the
factual
area
that
under
the
antitrust
laws
there
should
be
some
exception
to
the
general
rule.
now,
neither
this
nor
any
of
the
other
factual
statements
had
anything
to
do
with
the
opinion
below.
as
i
have
indicated,
the
factual
statements
that
were
made
by
judge
decker
related
to
his
ruling
on
the
release
of
grand
jury
minutes
of
the
--
his
finding
on
the
work
product
doctrine
and
his
finding
on
a
personal
attorney-client
privilege.
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
well,
i
have
to
touch
it
very
briefly
obviously
and
i
have
to
rely
for
a
more
detail
discussion
on
the
brief.
mr.
h.
templeton
brown
i
will
state
about
five
things.
i
think
that
the
importance
of
the
question
is
made
clear
as
indicated
by
the
interests
of
the
attorneys
throughout
the
country
in
the
various
bar
associations.
there
was
no
other
effective
remedy
that
was
available
in
this
instance.
the
court
below
not
only
refuse
to
certify
but
refuse
to
return
the
impounded
documents
so
that
had
respondents
chose
him
to,
they
could've
refuse
to
produce
them
and
gone
up
under
contempt.
obviously,
a
--
that
is
obviously
a
ruling
after
the
documents
were
released
would
not
be
an
adequate
remedy
the
information
is
gone.
if
even
more
importance
to
me,
failure
to
review
the
order
of
the
trial
court
would
have
left
unresolved
in
the
event
of
a
verdict
for
the
defendants
or
a
settlement
an
issue
which
was
stated
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
have
substantial
importance
to
the
administration
of
justice.
i
think
also
particularly
compelling
as
the
fact
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
radiant
burners
in
1963
cited
with
approval
the
decisions
of
judges
leahy
and
wyzanski
and
the
zenith
radio
and
united
shoe
machinery
cases
stating
that
in
those
cases,
the
problem
posed
“where
a
corporation
must
act
through
its
officers
and
employees
was
competently
met.”
in
both
of
those
decisions,
the
privilege
was
held
to
protect
communications
between
an
attorney
and
employees
of
a
corporation
who
were
not
claimed
to
be.
and
in
fact,
obviously
were
not
members
of
a
control
group.
an
appellate
court
generally
has
it
within
its
power
to
grant
mandamus
and
exceptional
situations
and
i
would
say
that
assuredly
that
power
exist
for
its
exercise
for
the
purpose
of
compelling
a
lower
court
to
adhere
the
principles
which
the
appellate
court
has
enunciated.
i
see
the
warning
sign
and
in
closing,
may
i
say
that
i
consider
this
to
be
as
an
important
argument.
it
has
ever
been
my
privilege
to
make
and
i
only
trust
--
i
have
adequately
presented
the
position
of
the
many
attorneys
who
through
their
bar
associations
and
have
shown
their
concern
and
the
resolution
of
an
issue
which
in
their
opinion
will
have
a
very
serious
barring
upon
their
ability
to
serve
the
best
interests
of
their
clients
and
of
society.
thank
you.
