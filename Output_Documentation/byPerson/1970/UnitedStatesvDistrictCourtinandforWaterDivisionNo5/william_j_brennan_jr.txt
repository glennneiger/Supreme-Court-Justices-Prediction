justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
they
ever
brought
one
in
colorado?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
long
though
was
this
mr.
balcomb?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
said
a
decree
by
a
stipulation.
is
this
to
say
that
was
settled,
is
that
case
settled?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
balcomb,
what’s
your
absolutely
government’s
submission
that
the
both
the
adjudication
and
the
administration
clauses
are
qualified
by
the
provision
as
to
appropriative
rights?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i
have
reference
to
though
is
that
--
as
i
understand
the
argument,
reserved
rights
are
not
embraced
by
the
consent
statute.
and
because
i
thought,
your
colleague
argued
that
both
clause
one,
the
adjudication
of
rights,
in
clause
two,
the
administration
of
such
rights
are
qualified
by
the
provision
where
it
appears
that
the
united
states
is
the
owner
over
in
the
process
of
acquiring
rights
by
appropriation
under
the
state
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
it
covers
reserve
rights
too?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
say
it
covers
everything?
you
mean
both
clauses
one
and
two
cover
everything
or
only
clause
one
covers
everything?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that’s
what
i
was
talking
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
i
thought
--
i
thought
the
government’s
argument
was
that
the
adjudication
of
rights
does
not
include
the
adjudication
of
reserved
rights?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
because
the
clause
dealing
with
the
administration
of
rights,
the
government
argues
is
limited
to
water
rights
by
appropriation
under
state
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
whatever
the
right
is,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who
braces
appropriative
over
anything
else?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
balcomb?
was
the
consent
statute
passed
as
it
was
introduced
or
did
it
go
through
some
modifications?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
but
ever
made
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
about
the
first
sentence?
was
that
changed
or
was
that
passed
and
was
introduced?
that’s
the
one
with
the
consent
given
to
join
one
for
adjudication
and
two
for
administration?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
the
administrative
proceeding?
what
is
the
referee,
is
he
judicial
officer
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
it,
like
master
is
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who
makes
the
final
adjudication,
the
judge
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how’s
the
whole
proceeding
initiated,
by
something
that’s
filed
in
the
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
does
he
file
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
he
is
the
clerk?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
so,
it’s
actually
a
proceeding
and
initiated
and
progresses
through
the
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
is
it
subject
to
removal
of
the
federal
court?
from
the
time
of
the
initial
claim
is
filed
with
the
water
clerk?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
that
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
this
removal?
do
you
agree
that
might
be
removed
as
quickly
as
mr.
balcomb
suggests?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
you
ever
tried
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally
what
were
the
rights
claim
by
the
united
states
in
that
litigation,
reserved
or
appropriate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
including
reserve.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
suggesting
that
we
have
to
decide
in
this
case
whether
this
colorado
procedure
is
a
judicial
or
a
administrative
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
order
to
decide
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
just
wanted
the
consent
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
accepting
that
premise,
now
you’re
suggesting
that
we
have
to
decide
whether
this
colorado
procedure
in
this
case
was
or
was
not
a
judicial
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you’re
suggesting
we
have
to
decide
whether
is
or
isn’t
a
judicial
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
we
accept
your
premise
that
congress
meant
the
consent
statute
to
apply
only
if
judicial
procedure.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
they
ever
brought
one
in
colorado?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
long
though
was
this
mr.
balcomb?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
said
a

by
a

is
this
to
say
that
was

is
that

what’s

do
you
agree

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
it
covers
reserve
rights
too?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
say
it
covers
everything?
you
mean
both
clauses
one
and
two
cover
everything
or
only
clause
one
covers
everything?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

that’s
what
i
was
talking
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

yes,
but
i
thought
--
i
thought
the

that
the

that

the

the

argues
is
limited

of
whatever

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who
braces
appropriative
over
anything
else?
justice
william
j.

mr.
balcomb?
was
the
consent
statute
passed
as

or
did
it
go

justice
william
j.

yes.

how

justice
william

well,
how’s
the
whole
proceeding
initiated,
by
something
that’s
filed
in
the
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
does
he
file
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
he
is
the
clerk?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
so,
it’s
actually
a
proceeding
and
initiated
and
progresses
through
the
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
is
it
subject
to
removal
of
the
federal
court?
from
the
time
of
the

with
the
water
clerk?
justice
william

in

what
about
this
removal?
do
you
agree
that
might
be

as

suggests?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

have
you
ever

justice
william
j.

incidentally
what
were
the
rights
claim
by
the
united
states
in
that
litigation,
reserved
or
appropriate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
including
reserve.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
suggesting
that
we
have
to
decide
in
this
case
whether
this
colorado
procedure
is
a
judicial
or
a
administrative
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
order
to
decide
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
just
wanted
the
consent
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
accepting
that
premise,
now
you’re
suggesting
that
we
have
to
decide
whether
this
colorado
procedure
in
this
case
was
or
was
not
a
judicial
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you’re
suggesting
we
have
to
decide
whether
is
or
isn’t
a
judicial
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
we
accept
your
premise
that
congress
meant
the
consent
statute
to
apply
only
if
judicial
procedure.
