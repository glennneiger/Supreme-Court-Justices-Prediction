mr.
kenneth
balcomb
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
one
of
the
most
interesting
and
novel
thing
about
the
second
case
is
the
--
now,
we
say
that
they
are
identical.
i
think
i
can
establish
that
the
procedures
involved
in
adjudication
under
the
old
and
the
new
law
are
identical
is
that
the
presence
or
absence
of
a
judgment
below
that
is
in
opinion
that
can
be
interpreted.
i
don’t
believe
that
it’s
judge
darrel’s
opinion
to
which
i
will
refer
later
on,
the
trial
judge
that
is
here.
i
just
believe
it
is
mr.
justice
grows’
opinion
in
87
that
is
probably
the
subject
matter
of
the
discussion
here
likewise.
it’s
interesting
to
note
that
under
the
old
statute,
the
primary
objection
to
the
government
to
being
bound
by
the
proceedings
for
at
least,
there
stay
adjudicated
--
adjudicatory
rights
related
to
the
size
of
the
stream
system
or
source
of
the
water.
and
this
oddly
enough
is
a
situation
which
is
never
bothered
them
when
they
wanted
to
be
plaintiff,
but
now
only
bothers
them
when
they
do
not
wish
to
articulate
and
do
not
wish
to
quantify
their
rights.
there
are
several
circumstances
that
i
know
of
where
the
united
states
is
come
in,
i
can
point
to
the
ones,
two
in
nevada,
one
of
which
was
before
this
court
on
the
separate
point
that
we
could
go
yesterday
to
the
extent
that
certiorari
was
denied,
that
was
the
carson
river
case
in
nevada.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
in
colorado,
yes
sir.
they,
about
the
time
that
united
states
decided
that
did
not
want
to
subject
themselves
to
state
adjudicating
procedures,
there
was
pending
in
the
district
court
for
summit
county,
located
at
breckenridge,
two
parallel
adjudication
procedures.
one,
to
adjudicate
rights
for
irrigation
and
another
one
to
adjudicate
rights
other
than
the
irrigation,
under
the
statute
which
preceded
the
1943
act
which
brought
those
two
times
the
things
all
into
one
action.
and
though
the
colorado
supreme
court
ultimately
held
that
the
government
had
made
a
voluntary
appearance
in
those
proceedings
and
could
thereby
be
bound,
the
united
states
selected
to
bring
an
action
which
for
this
lack
of
anything
better
to
call
it
in
the
nature
of
the
quiet
title
action.
in
other
words,
a
suit
in
equity
to
determine
the
government’s
rights
to
a
reclamation
project,
the
colorado
big
thompson
project
which
had
not
by
them,
then
completely
submitted
to
the
court
of
breckenridge.
now,
the
blue
river
is
a
little
bit
larger
than
the
eagle
river,
but
it’s
the
same
kind
of
a
system
and
it
ends
up
by
running
into
the
colorado
river.
that
would
not
have
been
even
under
their
definition,
a
general
adjudication
because
they
were
very
choosy
about
who
they
joined,
joining
the
conservancy
district,
the
involve
northern
colorado,
city
and
county
of
denver,
colorado
springs
and
everyone
else
who
got
into
that
action.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
the
suit
was
initiated
about
1952,
i
believe
and
then
went
to
the
decree
by
the
stipulation
in
1955
and
it’s
been
amended
a
couple
of
times
since
then.
oddly
enough
the
way
it
became
a
general
proceeding
was
that
the
united
states
removed
the
then
pending
adjudication
procedures
from
the
breckenridge
courts,
district
court
and
summit
county
and
thereby
brought
in
our
view
everybody
on
the
colorado
river,
even
though
it
was
said
to
be
supplemental
then.
it
was
a
supplemental
general
adjudication
pending
in
summit
county,
they
brought
in
the
federal
court
and
they
thereby
joined
the
users
of
the
entire
river
and
i’m
satisfied
they
consider
that
they
have
decrees
for
the
green
mountain
reservoir,
the
colorado
big
thompson
collection
systems
and
the
right
to
transport
this
water
through
the
mountains.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes,
i
believe
so.
they
have
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
recognize
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
--
by
removal.
and
nobody
in
colorado
really
seems
to
know
the
answer.
they
appear
at
least
in
part
still
to
be
removed
and
has
created
a
little
bit
of
confusion
and
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes
sir
and
the
united
states
was
given
the
right
and
claim
the
initiation
of
construction
in
1935.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
you
mean
something
open
note
notorious
or
something
to
that
nature
your
honor?
i
judge
not.
i
didn’t
--
i
don’t
wish
to
quarrel
with
your
honor
about
not
liking
the
word
“reserve.”
i
just
say
that
it’s
another
was
of
saying
the
initiation
of
a
water
right
and
in
this
case,
if
i’m
interpreting
it
correctly,
the
congress
initiates
the
reserve
rights
for
a
union
reservation
or
forest
reservation,
the
wildlife
refuge
by
making
the
withdrawal
of
the
land
and
the
water.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
so,
neither
is
the
city
and
county
of
denver
your
honor
and
they
claim
water
rights
that
they
don
not
expect
to
put
into
operation
until
year
the
2010.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
they
got
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
well,
yes
in
some
respect.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
there’s
nothing
--
nothing
in
the
law
prohibits
the
acquisition
of
a
right
currently
for
use
so
far
--
in
the
far
distant
future
if
you
can
show
the
need,
the
eventual
need.
as
the
colorado
supreme
court
held,
the
court
could
not
question
denver’s
projections
about
population,
nor
do
i
think
that
the
trial
court
really
questioned
the
allegations
and
proof
by
the
united
states
of
eventual
need
for
water
on
their
reservations.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes
sir.
and
in
reality,
i
think
they
have
little
problem
with
most
of
them
because
on
almost
every
circumstance,
the
water
and
the
water
right
involved
are
totally
within
the
federal
reservation.
you
would
have
to
have
their
permission
to
do
anything
anybody
else
to
interfere
with
it
and
they
have
complete
control
of
it.
as
i
say,
the
objection
in
87
related
to
the
size
of
the
water
course,
and
yet
in
every
situation
for
practical
purposes
except
the
arizona
versus
california,
where
united
states
is
been
involved,
that
is
been
almost
a
comparable
water
course
involved
and
created
no
real
problem
to
them
there.
in
the
instant
case,
it
seems
to
relate
to
how
much
trouble
they
would
be
put
to
read
monthly
resumes
and
to
appear
once
every
60
days
if
indeed,
they
have
to.
that
is
kind
of
an
administrative
rather
than
judicial
proceeding
and
not
within
the
contemplation
of
the
amendment.
i
would
observe
with
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
alright
sir.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
there
are
several
decisions
in
which
in
some
cases,
they
held
the
right
of
removal
that
was
not
present,
in
some
they
said,
the
right
to
removal
was
exercise
is
prematurely
exercise,
but
it
might
come
back
after
a
clear
federal
question
arises
in
the
state
court.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
oh!
i
think
it
was
in
some
of
these
cases.
the
–
in
re
green
river
case
in
utah
went
back
on
remand
by
judge
christiansen
because
he
felt
i
think
more
under
the
theory
of
comity
than
anything
else
the
court
--
state
court
had
the
procedures,
adjudicate
it
there.
if
that
with
united
states
found
could
not
get
fairness
with
regard
to
some
of
its
rights,
then
it
might
remove
it
for
the
fact.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
it
is.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
so
if
you
study
the
legislative
history,
you
might
draw
an
opposite
conclusion,
but
on
the
face
of
the
statute
is
not
forbidden,
i’ll
say
that.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes
sir
and
i
think
in
that
connection,
the
special
assistant
attorney
general
testifying
about
it
pointed
out
the
difficulties
involved
for
people
over
far
western
slope
to
have
to
come
clear
to
denver
colorado.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
they
thought
--
then
justice
thought
the
removal
provision
was
bad.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
it’s
speaks
of
the
united
states
in
two
categories
i
believe.
one
is
the
owner
of
the
water
right
and
the
second
category
is
in
the
acquisition
of
these
other
methods
of
acquiring
ownership
of
water
rights,
and
where
the
united
states
is
owner,
why
they
can
be
joined?
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
because
this
does
have
a
possible
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
do
i
agree
with
the
government’s
position?
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
i
think
that
it
covers
everything
is
my
position
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
that’s
correct
or
by
whatever
name
you
might
call
it.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
both
of
them.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes
sir.
it
would
do
little
good
to
require
the
united
states
to
come
in
and
adjudicate
a
reserved
right
if
they
then
try
to
take
out
a
priority
which
is
the
administration
system
and
not
be
able
to
reach
in
the
second
time.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
i
know
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
well
then,
the
first
one
is
meaningless.
i
think
i
read
two
circumstances,
either
the
united
states
is
the
owner
and
there’s
adjudication
in
progress
or
the
united
states
is
the
owner
and
like
in
the
quinn
river
situation,
there’s
an
administrative
process.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
whatever
the
right
might
be
irrespective
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
adjudication
as
we
understand
it
in
the
western
states
is
the
legal
court
process
through
which
you
go
to
establish
your
position
on
the
ladder
of
rights,
your
priority
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes.
administration
is
the
physical
act
by
the
division
engineer,
the
state
engineer
or
one
of
his
employees
of
opening
and
closing
head
gates
saying
you
can
take
your
water
now,
you
reservoir
is
full,
the
various
items
involved
in
the
distribution
of
the
water.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
that’s
the
rights
now,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
that’s
correct.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
that’s
right.
it
determines
all
that
you
may
turn
so
much
water
at
a
certain
time
into
your
head
gate,
if
we
reduce
that
something
to
the
irrigation
thing.
and
i
might
further
say
that
if
congress
had
really
thought
“well,
we
should
not
adjudicate
indian
rights
or
we
should
not
have
not
–
not
adjudicate
foreign
service
rights,”
it
was
too
simple
to
say
so
because
it
was
called
to
their
attention
over
the
three-year
period
this
was
involved
again
and
again
and
again
by
the
government
witnesses,
by
letters
to
the
committee
and
each
time,
concerned
about
the
breadth
of
the
waiver,
they
wanted
it
limited
every
time.
and
congress
ignored
all
these
and
left
it
wide
because
i
think
congress
recognized
that
it
was
just
as
important
to
the
citizens
of
those
states
that
they
have
certainty
in
water
rights
and
they
could
not
have
that
certainty
if
the
government
is
not
there.
and
likewise,
it
was
of
most
importance
to
the
united
states
to
have
certainty
as
its
water
rights,
and
i
think
one
of
the
examples
of
this
that
i’d
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
to
is
a
case
which
isn't
mentioned
too
much
by
anyone
and
it’s
also
captioned
in
re
green
river
adjudication
versus
the
united
states
and
it’s
in
the
supreme
court
of
utah
in
1965
and
answers
in
part
this
problem
to
the
state
court
award
you
reserve
rights
and
what
did
you
about
if
they
didn’t?
this
case
is
the
successor
to
the
federal
court
case
decided
by
judge
christiansen
when
he
directed
remand
of
the
adjudication
proceedings
in
daggett
county,
utah.
this
is
a
relatively
small
area
also.
in
this
proceeding
after
the
united
states
got
back
in
the
state
court,
it
had
no
reluctance
to
present
for
adjudication
by
the
state
court
some
715
water
rights.
oddly
enough,
they
were
apparently
the
type
of
thing
that
is
spring
for
stock
watering
matters
of
this
nature
which
if
we
understand,
what
they
did
in
eagle
county
in
87
are
the
subject
of
the
reservation,
but
they
were
there
adjudicated
as
though
they
were
state
rights.
at
the
very
tail
end
of
the
proceedings,
they
asked
the
trial
judge
to
put
some
language
into
the
decree
indicating
that
all
of
the
rights
which
were
awarded
by
virtue
of
this
decree
would
be
subject
to
the
general
unspecified
reservation
of
the
united
states
for
the
ashley
national
forrest
and
the
trial
judge
declined
to
do
so.
they
took
the
matter
to
the
supreme
court
of
utah
and
the
supreme
court
of
utah
likewise
declined
to
do
so,
pointing
out
that
united
states
had
volunteered
into
the
--
into
the
suit
in
effect
by
consenting
to
be
sued.
they
have
proved
up
on
715
rights
and
they
were
not
going
to
allow
them
to
have
an
articulated,
unspecified,
unquantified
right
that
sat
on
top
the
whole
adjudication
and
made
everybody
else’s
rights
uncertain.
that
is
clearly
what
this
case
does
hold.
united
states
did
not
elect
to
bring
that
to
this
court
had
they
wished
to
change
that
result.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
some
modification.
there
is
the
provision
added
to
it
that
it
does
not
consent
to
the
joinder
of
the
united
states
in
suits
between
states
like
so
often
happens
in
this
court.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
there
was
first
put
in
it
a
tabulation
of
which
the
government
now
talks
about,
and
then
that
was
eliminated.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
punctuation
only
was
added
i
believe
and
that
was
the
subject
of
the
reports,
the
second
report
from
the
senate
committee.
now,
the
united
states
is
said
and
had
brought
with
it
a
map.
now,
this
is
a
tremendously
big
job
that
if
you
say
we
got
to
go
and
adjudicate
that
we
got
to
do
and
as
i
said
in
my
discussion,
it
was
brought
out
at
least
in
connection
with
questions
in
my
discussion,
this
matter
of
costing
money
and
being
a
big
job
was
thoroughly
discussed
with
the
committee
and
this
was
overlooked.
i
submit
though
however
that
irrespective
of
the
size
of
the
job,
it’s
the
obligation
of
the
federal
government
in
a
situation
of
this
nature
for
the
benefit
of
all
of
its
citizens
to
articulate
because
the
citizens
need
to
know.
they
can’t
develop
the
state
without
knowing
what
these
vast
claims
united
states
may
have
now
to
the
water
which
arises
in
the
states.
and
irrespective
its
size,
they
owe
the
obligation
to
the
citizen
to
come
in
tell
him
within
his
framework
exactly
what
it
is
they
claim
and
when
they
expect
to
claim
it.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
well,
they’re
all
adjudicated
for
a
purpose
as
well
as
time
and
quantity.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
the
highest
and
best
use
by
the
constitution
is
domestic,
the
second
is
agriculture,
the
third
of
course
is
manufacturing
industrial.
it
doesn’t
mean
that
a
domestic
user
can
go
just
take
the
water,
he’s
got
to
condemn
and
pay
for
it.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
and
the
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
that’s
right.
i
don’t
think
united
states
your
honor,
those
in
quite
that
position
is
due
to
indicate.
they
condemn
--
in
theory,
they
condemn
at
least
domestic
rights
for
agriculture
purposes
on
the
basis
that
federal
law
was
paramount.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
with
which
i
would
concur,
they
can
do
it.
i
would
like
to
conclude
if
the
court
please
with
the
a
comparison
so
to
speak
of
the
new
statute
which
i
view
to
be
identical
for
practical
purposes
of
the
1943
act
and
the
1943
act
is
characterized
in
mr.
clark’s
work
on
water
rights
is
being
the
same
colorado
system
that’s
been
in
existence
since
1879
when
it
first
started.
in
this
fashion,
the
court
will
remember
pacific
livestock,
in
discussing
what
a
statute
to
this
nature
does
said
that
that
statute
provided
for
notice,
that
is
the
oregon
statute.
our
statute
provides
for
notice.
it
is
as
the
proceeding
ahead
of
it
was
and
in
rem
proceeding,
dealing
with
--
still
dealing
with
the
stream,
still
putting
on
the
ladder
of
appropriations
in
order
of
priority
everybody’s
rights.
a
sworn
statement
in
the
oregon
case
was
made
and
that
statement
was
open
to
the
public
and
opposition
could
be
made
as
to
that
statement,
that’s
the
identical
procedures
we
now
have
in
our
code.
the
statement
is
filed
with
the
water
clerk
and
it’s
referred
to
the
referee.
you
may
protest
it.
you
may
have
hearings.
you
may
do
all
those
things.
the
board
in
oregon
made
findings
and
referred
the
matter
back
to
the
court
and
under
oregon
statute,
the
referee
does
this.
in
other
words,
referee
has
taken
the
owner’s
--
pardon?
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes
sir.
he
is
supported
by
the
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
i
would
say
yes
sir,
special
proceeding,
but
it’s
nonetheless
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
the
judge
does.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
he
enters
a
--
there
is
a
little
bit
of
difference
about
this
in
colorado,
but
primarily,
he
is
supposed
to
enter
semi-annually
a
master
decree
covering
all
the
matters
with
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
someone
goes
in
and
files
a
claim
for
lack
of
better
word.
they
asked
for
the
determination
of
the
water
right.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
with
the
water
clerk
who
is
the
clerk
of
the
court,
and
then
the
court
governs
the
whole
division.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
of
the
court.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes
sir.
if
there’s
a
big
fight
below
in
the
referee’s
hands,
he
refers
it
back
to
the
court
for
determination.
whatever
the
court
does
is
to
be
done
is
to
be
done
under
our
rules
of
civil
procedure.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
i
think
as
soon
as
united
states
could
show
that
its
rights
were
being
interfered
with,
and
that
the
state
court
certainly,
if
it
goes
into
the
position
to
handle
them,
might
grab
go
ahead
and
handle
it.
they
make
the
point
you
understand
your
honor
that
the
statute
allows
for
protest
but
not
for
application.
that
is
the
united
states
has
no
chance
to
urge
its
rights,
and
this
is
strictly
not
true.
the
united
states
anytime
it
wants
to
one
of
these
proceeding
files
its
rights
and
sue
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
in
that
year
with
the
same
clerk
and
goes
before
the
same
referee
and
gets
the
same
judge
and
a
decree.
and
he
would
then
insert
or
direct
the
insertion
to
the
state
engineer
of
their
rights,
plug
them
into
the
ladder
of
priority.
and
they
have
the
right
of
appeal
and
everyone
does
to
the
state
supreme
court.
in
other
words,
we
have
a
judicial
system
and
as
i
say,
we’ve
taken
this
onerous
burden
of
digging
up
the
evidence
off
the
court
and
given
it
to
the
referee
to
save
the
court
time
and
courts
are
all
too
busy
to
spend
days
and
months
on
adjudication
procedures.
i
would
like
to
say
in
final
conclusion
unless
there
are
other
statements
that
in
as
true
sense
of
the
word
as
use
in
pacific
livestock
as
use
the
word
general
adjudication
is
used
in
dugan
and
miller
versus
jennings
and
the
like,
there
never
really
has
been
a
true
adjudication
of
water
rights
in
colorado
or
any
of
the
other
western
states
when
the
united
states
is
not
a
party.
and
they
have
picked
the
word
general
out
of
the
opinions
of
this
court
and
opinions
of
other
courts
and
said
they
don’t
have
a
general
proceeding
there
because
they
do
not
have
everyone
before
them.
and
the
reason,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
everyone
is
not
before
them
is
because
united
states
will
not
join.
there
the
one
party,
these
adjudication
procedures
in
colorado
and
the
other
states
that
keeps
it
from
being
a
general
adjudication,
and
that
keeps
the
certainty
of
water
rights
out
of
the
law
entirely
because
as
they
indicate,
we
have
these
large
areas
as
shown
on
the
map
that
we're
entitled
to
use
water
in
certain
ways,
but
we
want
to
keep
it
a
secret
until
such
time
as
we
decide
to
put
it
to
work
and
in
the
meantime,
no
one
else
can
do
anything
with
the
water
at
all
with
any
certainty.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
one
of
the
most
interesting
and
novel
thing
about
the
second
case
is
the
--
now,
we
say
that
they
are
identical.
i
think
i
can
establish
that
the
procedures
involved
in
adjudication
under
the
old
and
the
new
law
are
identical
is
that
the
presence
or
absence
of
a
judgment
below
that
is
in
opinion
that
can
be
interpreted.
i
don’t
believe
that
it’s
judge
darrel’s
opinion
to
which
i
will
refer
later
on,
the
trial
judge
that
is
here.
i
just
believe
it
is
mr.
justice
grows’
opinion
in
87
that
is
probably
the
subject
matter
of
the
discussion
here
likewise.
it’s
interesting
to
note
that
under
the
old
statute,
the
primary
objection
to
the
government
to
being
bound
by
the
proceedings
for
at
least,
there
stay
adjudicated
--
adjudicatory
rights
related
to
the
size
of
the
stream
system
or
source
of
the
water.
and
this
oddly
enough
is
a
situation
which
is
never
bothered
them
when
they
wanted
to
be
plaintiff,
but
now
only
bothers
them
when
they
do
not
wish
to
articulate
and
do
not
wish
to
quantify
their
rights.
there
are
several
circumstances
that
i
know
of
where
the
united
states
is
come
in,
i
can
point
to
the
ones,
two
in
nevada,
one
of
which
was
before
this
court
on
the
separate
point
that
we
could
go
yesterday
to
the
extent
that
certiorari
was
denied,
that
was
the
carson
river
case
in
nevada.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
in
colorado,
yes
sir.
they,
about
the
time
that
united
states
decided
that
did
not
want
to
subject
themselves
to
state
adjudicating
procedures,
there
was
pending
in
the
district
court
for
summit
county,
located
at
breckenridge,
two
parallel
adjudication
procedures.
one,
to
adjudicate
rights
for
irrigation
and
another
one
to
adjudicate
rights
other
than
the
irrigation,
under
the
statute
which
preceded
the
1943
act
which
brought
those
two
times
the
things
all
into
one
action.
and
though
the
colorado
supreme
court
ultimately
held
that
the
government
had
made
a
voluntary
appearance
in
those
proceedings
and
could
thereby
be
bound,
the
united
states
selected
to
bring
an
action
which
for
this
lack
of
anything
better
to
call
it
in
the
nature
of
the
quiet
title
action.
in
other
words,
a
suit
in
equity
to
determine
the
government’s
rights
to
a
reclamation
project,
the
colorado
big
thompson
project
which
had
not
by
them,
then
completely
submitted
to
the
court
of
breckenridge.
now,
the
blue
river
is
a
little
bit
larger
than
the
eagle
river,
but
it’s
the
same
kind
of
a
system
and
it
ends
up
by
running
into
the
colorado
river.
that
would
not
have
been
even
under
their
definition,
a
general
adjudication
because
they
were
very
choosy
about
who
they
joined,
joining
the
conservancy
district,
the
involve
northern
colorado,
city
and
county
of
denver,
colorado
springs
and
everyone
else
who
got
into
that
action.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
the
suit
was
initiated
about
1952,
i
believe
and
then
went
to
the
decree
by
the
stipulation
in
1955
and
it’s
been
amended
a
couple
of
times
since
then.
oddly
enough
the
way
it
became
a
general
proceeding
was
that
the
united
states
removed
the
then
pending
adjudication
procedures
from
the
breckenridge
courts,
district
court
and
summit
county
and
thereby
brought
in
our
view
everybody
on
the
colorado
river,
even
though
it
was
said
to
be
supplemental
then.
it
was
a
supplemental
general
adjudication
pending
in
summit
county,
they
brought
in
the
federal
court
and
they
thereby
joined
the
users
of
the
entire
river
and
i’m
satisfied
they
consider
that
they
have
decrees
for
the
green
mountain
reservoir,
the
colorado
big
thompson
collection
systems
and
the
right
to
transport
this
water
through
the
mountains.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes,
i
believe
so.
they
have
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
recognize
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
--
by
removal.
and
nobody
in
colorado
really
seems
to
know
the
answer.
they
appear
at
least
in
part
still
to
be
removed
and
has
created
a
little
bit
of
confusion
and
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes
sir
and
the
united
states
was
given
the
right
and
claim
the
initiation
of
construction
in
1935.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
you
mean
something
open
note
notorious
or
something
to
that
nature
your
honor?
i
judge
not.
i
didn’t
--
i
don’t
wish
to
quarrel
with
your
honor
about
not
liking
the
word
“reserve.”
i
just
say
that
it’s
another
was
of
saying
the
initiation
of
a
water
right
and
in
this
case,
if
i’m
interpreting
it
correctly,
the
congress
initiates
the
reserve
rights
for
a
union
reservation
or
forest
reservation,
the
wildlife
refuge
by
making
the
withdrawal
of
the
land
and
the
water.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
so,
neither
is
the
city
and
county
of
denver
your
honor
and
they
claim
water
rights
that
they
don
not
expect
to
put
into
operation
until
year
the
2010.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
they
got
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
well,
yes
in
some
respect.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
there’s
nothing
--
nothing
in
the
law
prohibits
the
acquisition
of
a
right
currently
for
use
so
far
--
in
the
far
distant
future
if
you
can
show
the
need,
the
eventual
need.
as
the
colorado
supreme
court
held,
the
court
could
not
question
denver’s
projections
about
population,
nor
do
i
think
that
the
trial
court
really
questioned
the
allegations
and
proof
by
the
united
states
of
eventual
need
for
water
on
their
reservations.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes
sir.
and
in
reality,
i
think
they
have
little
problem
with
most
of
them
because
on
almost
every
circumstance,
the
water
and
the
water
right
involved
are
totally
within
the
federal
reservation.
you
would
have
to
have
their
permission
to
do
anything
anybody
else
to
interfere
with
it
and
they
have
complete
control
of
it.
as
i
say,
the
objection
in
87
related
to
the
size
of
the
water
course,
and
yet
in
every
situation
for
practical
purposes
except
the
arizona
versus
california,
where
united
states
is
been
involved,
that
is
been
almost
a
comparable
water
course
involved
and
created
no
real
problem
to
them
there.
in
the
instant
case,
it
seems
to
relate
to
how
much
trouble
they
would
be
put
to
read
monthly
resumes
and
to
appear
once
every
60
days
if
indeed,
they
have
to.
that
is
kind
of
an
administrative
rather
than
judicial
proceeding
and
not
within
the
contemplation
of
the
amendment.
i
would
observe
with
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
alright
sir.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
there
are
several
decisions
in
which
in
some
cases,
they
held
the
right
of
removal
that
was
not
present,
in
some
they
said,
the
right
to
removal
was
exercise
is
prematurely
exercise,
but
it
might
come
back
after
a
clear
federal
question
arises
in
the
state
court.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
oh!
i
think
it
was
in
some
of
these
cases.
the
–
in
re
green
river
case
in
utah
went
back
on
remand
by
judge
christiansen
because
he
felt
i
think
more
under
the
theory
of
comity
than
anything
else
the
court
--
state
court
had
the
procedures,
adjudicate
it
there.
if
that
with
united
states
found
could
not
get
fairness
with
regard
to
some
of
its
rights,
then
it
might
remove
it
for
the
fact.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
it
is.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
so
if
you
study
the
legislative
history,
you
might
draw
an
opposite
conclusion,
but
on
the
face
of
the
statute
is
not
forbidden,
i’ll
say
that.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes
sir
and
i
think
in
that
connection,
the
special
assistant
attorney
general
testifying
about
it
pointed
out
the
difficulties
involved
for
people
over
far
western
slope
to
have
to
come
clear
to
denver
colorado.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
they
thought
--
then
justice
thought
the
removal
provision
was
bad.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
it’s
speaks
of
the
united
states
in
two
categories
i
believe.
one
is
the
owner
of
the
water
right
and
the
second
category
is
in
the
acquisition
of
these
other
methods
of
acquiring
ownership
of
water
rights,
and
where
the
united
states
is
owner,
why
they
can
be
joined?
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
because
this
does
have
a
possible
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
do
i
agree
with
the
government’s
position?
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
i
think
that
it
covers
everything
is
my
position
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
that’s
correct
or
by
whatever
name
you
might
call
it.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
both
of
them.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes
sir.
it
would
do
little
good
to
require
the
united
states
to
come
in
and
adjudicate
a
reserved
right
if
they
then
try
to
take
out
a
priority
which
is
the
administration
system
and
not
be
able
to
reach
in
the
second
time.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
i
know
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
well
then,
the
first
one
is
meaningless.
i
think
i
read
two
circumstances,
either
the
united
states
is
the
owner
and
there’s
adjudication
in
progress
or
the
united
states
is
the
owner
and
like
in
the
quinn
river
situation,
there’s
an
administrative
process.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
whatever
the
right
might
be
irrespective
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
adjudication
as
we
understand
it
in
the
western
states
is
the
legal
court
process
through
which
you
go
to
establish
your
position
on
the
ladder
of
rights,
your
priority
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes.
administration
is
the
physical
act
by
the
division
engineer,
the
state
engineer
or
one
of
his
employees
of
opening
and
closing
head
gates
saying
you
can
take
your
water
now,
you
reservoir
is
full,
the
various
items
involved
in
the
distribution
of
the
water.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
that’s
the
rights
now,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
that’s
correct.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
that’s
right.
it
determines
all
that
you
may
turn
so
much
water
at
a
certain
time
into
your
head
gate,
if
we
reduce
that
something
to
the
irrigation
thing.
and
i
might
further
say
that
if
congress
had
really
thought
“well,
we
should
not
adjudicate
indian
rights
or
we
should
not
have
not
–
not
adjudicate
foreign
service
rights,”
it
was
too
simple
to
say
so
because
it
was
called
to
their
attention
over
the
three-year
period
this
was
involved
again
and
again
and
again
by
the
government
witnesses,
by
letters
to
the
committee
and
each
time,
concerned
about
the
breadth
of
the
waiver,
they
wanted
it
limited
every
time.
and
congress
ignored
all
these
and
left
it
wide
because
i
think
congress
recognized
that
it
was
just
as
important
to
the
citizens
of
those
states
that
they
have
certainty
in
water
rights
and
they
could
not
have
that
certainty
if
the
government
is
not
there.
and
likewise,
it
was
of
most
importance
to
the
united
states
to
have
certainty
as
its
water
rights,
and
i
think
one
of
the
examples
of
this
that
i’d
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
to
is
a
case
which
isn't
mentioned
too
much
by
anyone
and
it’s
also
captioned
in
re
green
river
adjudication
versus
the
united
states
and
it’s
in
the
supreme
court
of
utah
in
1965
and
answers
in
part
this
problem
to
the
state
court
award
you
reserve
rights
and
what
did
you
about
if
they
didn’t?
this
case
is
the
successor
to
the
federal
court
case
decided
by
judge
christiansen
when
he
directed
remand
of
the
adjudication
proceedings
in
daggett
county,
utah.
this
is
a
relatively
small
area
also.
in
this
proceeding
after
the
united
states
got
back
in
the
state
court,
it
had
no
reluctance
to
present
for
adjudication
by
the
state
court
some
715
water
rights.
oddly
enough,
they
were
apparently
the
type
of
thing
that
is
spring
for
stock
watering
matters
of
this
nature
which
if
we
understand,
what
they
did
in
eagle
county
in
87
are
the
subject
of
the
reservation,
but
they
were
there
adjudicated
as
though
they
were
state
rights.
at
the
very
tail
end
of
the
proceedings,
they
asked
the
trial
judge
to
put
some
language
into
the
decree
indicating
that
all
of
the
rights
which
were
awarded
by
virtue
of
this
decree
would
be
subject
to
the
general
unspecified
reservation
of
the
united
states
for
the
ashley
national
forrest
and
the
trial
judge
declined
to
do
so.
they
took
the
matter
to
the
supreme
court
of
utah
and
the
supreme
court
of
utah
likewise
declined
to
do
so,
pointing
out
that
united
states
had
volunteered
into
the
--
into
the
suit
in
effect
by
consenting
to
be
sued.
they
have
proved
up
on
715
rights
and
they
were
not
going
to
allow
them
to
have
an
articulated,
unspecified,
unquantified
right
that
sat
on
top
the
whole
adjudication
and
made
everybody
else’s
rights
uncertain.
that
is
clearly
what
this
case
does
hold.
united
states
did
not
elect
to
bring
that
to
this
court
had
they
wished
to
change
that
result.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
some
modification.
there
is
the
provision
added
to
it
that
it
does
not
consent
to
the
joinder
of
the
united
states
in
suits
between
states
like
so
often
happens
in
this
court.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
there
was
first
put
in
it
a
tabulation
of
which
the
government
now
talks
about,
and
then
that
was
eliminated.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
punctuation
only
was
added
i
believe
and
that
was
the
subject
of
the
reports,
the
second
report
from
the
senate
committee.
now,
the
united
states
is
said
and
had
brought
with
it
a
map.
now,
this
is
a
tremendously
big
job
that
if
you
say
we
got
to
go
and
adjudicate
that
we
got
to
do
and
as
i
said
in
my
discussion,
it
was
brought
out
at
least
in
connection
with
questions
in
my
discussion,
this
matter
of
costing
money
and
being
a
big
job
was
thoroughly
discussed
with
the
committee
and
this
was
overlooked.
i
submit
though
however
that
irrespective
of
the
size
of
the
job,
it’s
the
obligation
of
the
federal
government
in
a
situation
of
this
nature
for
the
benefit
of
all
of
its
citizens
to
articulate
because
the
citizens
need
to
know.
they
can’t
develop
the
state
without
knowing
what
these
vast
claims
united
states
may
have
now
to
the
water
which
arises
in
the
states.
and
irrespective
its
size,
they
owe
the
obligation
to
the
citizen
to
come
in
tell
him
within
his
framework
exactly
what
it
is
they
claim
and
when
they
expect
to
claim
it.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
well,
they’re
all
adjudicated
for
a
purpose
as
well
as
time
and
quantity.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
the
highest
and
best
use
by
the
constitution
is
domestic,
the
second
is
agriculture,
the
third
of
course
is
manufacturing
industrial.
it
doesn’t
mean
that
a
domestic
user
can
go
just
take
the
water,
he’s
got
to
condemn
and
pay
for
it.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
and
the
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
that’s
right.
i
don’t
think
united
states
your
honor,
those
in
quite
that
position
is
due
to
indicate.
they
condemn
--
in
theory,
they
condemn
at
least
domestic
rights
for
agriculture
purposes
on
the
basis
that
federal
law
was
paramount.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
with
which
i
would
concur,
they
can
do
it.
i
would
like
to
conclude
if
the
court
please
with
the
a
comparison
so
to
speak
of
the
new
statute
which
i
view
to
be
identical
for
practical
purposes
of
the
1943
act
and
the
1943
act
is
characterized
in
mr.
clark’s
work
on
water
rights
is
being
the
same
colorado
system
that’s
been
in
existence
since
1879
when
it
first
started.
in
this
fashion,
the
court
will
remember
pacific
livestock,
in
discussing
what
a
statute
to
this
nature
does
said
that
that
statute
provided
for
notice,
that
is
the
oregon
statute.
our
statute
provides
for
notice.
it
is
as
the
proceeding
ahead
of
it
was
and
in
rem
proceeding,
dealing
with
--
still
dealing
with
the
stream,
still
putting
on
the
ladder
of
appropriations
in
order
of
priority
everybody’s
rights.
a
sworn
statement
in
the
oregon
case
was
made
and
that
statement
was
open
to
the
public
and
opposition
could
be
made
as
to
that
statement,
that’s
the
identical
procedures
we
now
have
in
our
code.
the
statement
is
filed
with
the
water
clerk
and
it’s
referred
to
the
referee.
you
may
protest
it.
you
may
have
hearings.
you
may
do
all
those
things.
the
board
in
oregon
made
findings
and
referred
the
matter
back
to
the
court
and
under
oregon
statute,
the
referee
does
this.
in
other
words,
referee
has
taken
the
owner’s
--
pardon?
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes
sir.
he
is
supported
by
the
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
i
would
say
yes
sir,
special
proceeding,
but
it’s
nonetheless
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
the
judge
does.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
he
enters
a
--
there
is
a
little
bit
of
difference
about
this
in
colorado,
but
primarily,
he
is
supposed
to
enter
semi-annually
a
master
decree
covering
all
the
matters
with
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
someone
goes
in
and
files
a
claim
for
lack
of
better
word.
they
asked
for
the
determination
of
the
water
right.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
with
the
water
clerk
who
is
the
clerk
of
the
court,
and
then
the
court
governs
the
whole
division.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
of
the
court.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes
sir.
if
there’s
a
big
fight
below
in
the
referee’s
hands,
he
refers
it
back
to
the
court
for
determination.
whatever
the
court
does
is
to
be
done
is
to
be
done
under
our
rules
of
civil
procedure.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
i
think
as
soon
as
united
states
could
show
that
its
rights
were
being
interfered
with,
and
that
the
state
court
certainly,
if
it
goes
into
the
position
to
handle
them,
might
grab
go
ahead
and
handle
it.
they
make
the
point
you
understand
your
honor
that
the
statute
allows
for
protest
but
not
for
application.
that
is
the
united
states
has
no
chance
to
urge
its
rights,
and
this
is
strictly
not
true.
the
united
states
anytime
it
wants
to
one
of
these
proceeding
files
its
rights
and
sue
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
in
that
year
with
the
same
clerk
and
goes
before
the
same
referee
and
gets
the
same
judge
and
a
decree.
and
he
would
then
insert
or
direct
the
insertion
to
the
state
engineer
of
their
rights,
plug
them
into
the
ladder
of
priority.
and
they
have
the
right
of
appeal
and
everyone
does
to
the
state
supreme
court.
in
other
words,
we
have
a
judicial
system
and
as
i
say,
we’ve
taken
this
onerous
burden
of
digging
up
the
evidence
off
the
court
and
given
it
to
the
referee
to
save
the
court
time
and
courts
are
all
too
busy
to
spend
days
and
months
on
adjudication
procedures.
i
would
like
to
say
in
final
conclusion
unless
there
are
other
statements
that
in
as
true
sense
of
the
word
as
use
in
pacific
livestock
as
use
the
word
general
adjudication
is
used
in
dugan
and
miller
versus
jennings
and
the
like,
there
never
really
has
been
a
true
adjudication
of
water
rights
in
colorado
or
any
of
the
other
western
states
when
the
united
states
is
not
a
party.
and
they
have
picked
the
word
general
out
of
the
opinions
of
this
court
and
opinions
of
other
courts
and
said
they
don’t
have
a
general
proceeding
there
because
they
do
not
have
everyone
before
them.
and
the
reason,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
everyone
is
not
before
them
is
because
united
states
will
not
join.
there
the
one
party,
these
adjudication
procedures
in
colorado
and
the
other
states
that
keeps
it
from
being
a
general
adjudication,
and
that
keeps
the
certainty
of
water
rights
out
of
the
law
entirely
because
as
they
indicate,
we
have
these
large
areas
as
shown
on
the
map
that
we're
entitled
to
use
water
in
certain
ways,
but
we
want
to
keep
it
a
secret
until
such
time
as
we
decide
to
put
it
to
work
and
in
the
meantime,
no
one
else
can
do
anything
with
the
water
at
all
with
any
certainty.
thank
you
your
honor.
