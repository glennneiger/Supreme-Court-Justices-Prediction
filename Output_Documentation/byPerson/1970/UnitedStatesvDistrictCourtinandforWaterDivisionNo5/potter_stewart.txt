the

hadn’t
matured

so
clarified

it
is
now.
perhaps,
there’d
been
the

the

so
in
other
words,
putting
my
brother
harlan’s
question
a
little
different
way.
if
you
prevail
in
the
first
case
on
your
basic
arguments,
then
we
--
then
you
also
prevail
in
the
second
case
and
we
need
not
reach
any
question
about
whether
it’s
judicial
or
administrative
in
the
second
case,
is
that
right?
