mr.
kiechel
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
under
the
colorado
water
rights
determination
and
administration
act
of
1969,
the
70
water
districts
were
replaced
with
7
water
divisions.
water
division
5
includes
the
area
drained
by
the
colorado
river
and
its
tributaries,
excluding
the
gunnison
river
and
this
includes
the
former
water
district
37
and
eagle
river
watershed.
in
february
of
last
year,
the
attorney
general
received
by
mail
a
paper
signed
by
the
water
clerk
of
the
water
division
5,
directed
that
all
persons
interested
in
water
applications
in
said
division,
supplying
a
list
of
water
right
applications
filed
in
that
office.
the
paper
concluded
with
the
statement
that
the
recipient
had
until
the
last
day
of
march,
1970,
that
was
the
month
thereafter
that
preceded
the
notice,
to
file
with
the
water
clerk
a
verified
statement
of
opposition
to
any
such
application.
similar
notices
had
been
received
by
the
attorney
general
listing
water
rights
applications
filed
during
each
month
thereafter
in
water
division
5
and
in
water
division
4
and
6
as
well.
the
response
to
the
1969
--
december
1969
notice,
the
united
states
filed
a
motion
to
quash,
this
was
denied.
the
writ
was
applied
for
the
colorado
supreme
court
which
was
denied.
as
in
the
eagle
county
case
affected
by
the
proceedings
in
water
division
5
or
federal
water
rights
of
two
types,
property
rights
acquired
in
the
state
law
and
reserved
another
rights
based
on
federal
law.
because
of
its
size,
water
division
5
contains
a
multitude
of
federal
rights
to
determine,
demonstrate
their
magnitude
in
nature.
we’ve
prepared
a
map
on
which
has
been
delineated
the
boundaries
of
water
division
5
and
shows
the
various
federal
reserve
areas
within
that
division
5
before
national
forest
or
parts
thereof
in
green,
the
naval
oil
shale
reserve,
black,
national
park
or
part
of
the
rocky
mount
national
park
on
that
side
of
the
divided
in
red
--
mr.
kiechel
oh,
i’m
sorry
sir.
mr.
kiechel
yes
your
honor.
we
are
concerned
about
the
opinion
of
the
colorado
supreme
court
to
that
extent
--
in
that
respect
to
the
extent
that
the
colorado
supreme
court
discussed
the
question.
they
said
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
reviewing
winters
v.
united
states
in
1908
which
announced
the
reserved
right
doctrine,
federal
power
of
commission
v.
oregon
349,
and
arizona
v.
california
in
1963
in
373,
were
not
determinative
of
the
question.
the
--
mr.
kiechel
yes
your
honor,
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
kiechel
yes.
our
position
is
that
this
is
--
it
is
reviewable
and
the
supreme
court
has
held
that
the
decision
--
in
affect
the
supreme
court
of
colorado
said
that
when
this
matter
was
presented
to
them,
and
they
were
decided
on
the
basis
of
colorado
law.
and
they
referred
to
the
stockman
versus
leddy
case
which
mr.
justice
white
referred
to
in
their
opinion
and
said
they
would
have
to
overrule
that
decision
if
they
found
that
there
were
reserved
rights
in
--
of
the
united
states
in
the
state
of
colorado.
mr.
kiechel
well,
leddy
--
mr.
kiechel
leddy
relies
upon
the
enabling
act
of
congress,
and
it
--
the
--
mr.
kiechel
they
said
that
by
admitting
colorado
into
the
union
with
a
constitutional
provision
--
state
constitutional
provision
that
said
that
all
rights
of
the
water
of
the
state
of
colorado
were
property
of
the
people
and
subject
to
appropriation
under
state
law
that
the
united
states
is
precluded
from
asserting
a
claim
of
reserve
rights
within
colorado.
our
response
to
that,
if
your
honor
please
is
that
the
enabling
statute
required
in
section
4
that
the
people
of
the
territory
of
colorado
recognize
and
disclaim
any
right
to
the
public
lands
within
that
territory
and
recognize
that
that
was
a
matter
for
the
sole
and
exclusive
disposition
of
the
united
states.
this
was
a
specific
provision
of
the
enabling
act
and
that
act
was
--
and
that
provision
was
referred
to
once
again,
when
the
president
proclaimed
in
his
presidential
proclamation
after
the
colorado
constitution
was
adopted
that
the
colorado
was
a
state.
so
that
we
say
by
the
provision
of
the
enabling
act,
congress
reserved
to
itself
for
the
right
disposed
of
public
lands,
except
for
the
school
land
which
were
granted
to
the
territory
and
certain
other
lands
and
specified
amount
for
public
buildings.
and
we
say
there
in
furtherance
of
that,
that
thereafter
when
the
united
states
reserved
from
the
public
domain
for
a
specified
purpose
lands,
it
reserved
as
well
the
appurtenant
water
rights
to
fulfill
the
purposes
of
that
reservation.
and
that
carries
with
it
the
priority
of
the
date
of
the
creation
of
the
reservations
subject
and
i
wish
to
point
out,
subject
to
rights
vested
at
the
time
of
its
creation.
the
matter
of
the
legislative
history,
i
would
discuss
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
if
there
were
some
specific
episode
which
triggered
off
the
enactment
of
that
statute,
and
i
think
that
mr.
balcomb
has
referred
to
the
specific
episode
which
did.
it
was
a
proceeding
in
the
home
state
of
senator
mccarran,
the
sponsor
of
the
act
in
nevada
on
the
quinn
river,
and
it
involved
a
suit
for
administration
of
water
rights
already
having
been
adjudicated
under
a
state
court.
and
there,
the
united
states
had
purchased,
had
acquired
by
purchase,
certain
water
rights
on
the
quinn
river
and
this
is
the
primary
concern
of
senator
mccarran.
this
is
demonstrated
by
his
statements
on
the
floor
of
the
senate,
the
fact
that
the
--
he
says
it’s
--
to
allow
the
united
states
in
its
own
right
whereas
a
trustee,
those
were
acquired
for
indian
purposes,
to
have
a
better
right
than
the
former
owner
is
not
fair
and
just
as
to
the
other
water
users
on
the
stream.
and
of
course,
the
terms
of
the
statute
as
been
pointed
out
refers
to
appropriation
under
state
law,
and
in
an
appropriative
right
states
such
as
nevada
or
colorado,
the
state
here
involved.
the
only
way
a
private
citizen
can
acquire
a
water
right
is
by
application
of
the
water
to
a
beneficial
use.
that
water
right
becomes
fixed
in
amount
in
quality
by
that
act.
another
characteristic
of
an
appropriative
right
is
that
it
is
subject
to
loss
through
abandonment
or
non
use.
now,
concerning
the
legal
characteristics
of
an
appropriative
right,
the
second
sentence
of
the
mccarran
act
which
i
would
refer
the
court’s
attention
to
is
consistent
with
the
first,
only
if
the
consent
to
sue
was
restricted
to
rights
acquired
under
state
law.
and
second
sentence
of
the
mccarran
amendment
says,
the
united
states,
when
a
party
to
any
such
suit,
one
shall
be
deemed
to
a
waive
any
right
to
plead
state
laws
are
inapplicable,
or
that
the
united
states
is
not
amenable,
there
too
by
reason
of
its
sovereignty
and
too
shall
be
subject
to
the
judgments,
orders
and
decrees
of
the
court
having
jurisdiction,
and
may
obtain
review
thereof
in
the
same
manner
into
the
same
extent
as
a
private
individual
under
like
circumstances.
mr.
kiechel
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
kiechel
there
was
not.
the
express
terms
the
statute
referred
as
rights
acquire
under
state
law,
for
appropriation
under
state
law.
mr.
kiechel
that’s
correct
your
honor.
but
what
i
am
saying
is
that
these
terms
of
the
statute
by
appropriation
under
state
law,
by
purchase,
exchange
or
otherwise
is
the
means
by
which
a
private
individual
can
acquire
a
water
right.
and
it
was
that
type
of
right
which
the
united
states
had
acquired
in
this
quinn
river
situation
that
senator
mccarran
was
concerned
about
being
subject
to
adjudication
or
in
that
case,
administration
by
the
state
court
of
nevada.
mr.
kiechel
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
kiechel
must
it.
the
winters
v.
united
states
was
a
landmark
decision
of
this
court
--
mr.
kiechel
yes
indeed,
and
it
was
until
arizona
v.
california
that
it
was
extended
to
other
federal
reservations,
but
the
concept
of
a
right
other
than
an
appropriative
right,
a
right
rising
by
creation
of
a
federal
reservation
was
well
known
in
the
water
law
of
the
west
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
the
mccarran
amendment.
now,
with
keeping
in
mind
the
intent
of
the
sponsor
that
is
senator
mccarran
to
said
be
equally
that
federal
government
and
private
citizens
to
adjudication
of
water
rights
acquired
under
the
state
law,
and
the
express
terms
of
the
statute
designed
to
carry
out
that
intent
in
sharp
distinction
and
contrast
are
reserve
rights.
the
reserve
rights
as
i’ve
said
arise
by
creation
of
the
reservation
automatically.
they
don’t
require
the
application
of
water
to
use,
priority
states
from
the
date
that
they
withdraw
and
applies
to
future
as
well
as
existing
use.
and
the
--
in
summary
with
respect
to
the
legislative
intent,
i’d
say
that
there
being
no
expressed
provision
in
the
terms
of
the
statute,
including
reserve
rights,
nor
any
specific
intent
by
the
sponsor
of
the
amendment,
it
follows
that
it
was
not
within
the
contemplation
of
congress
that
they
be
included
in
this
state
court
adjudication.
mr.
kiechel
yes.
mr.
kiechel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kiechel
they
provide
for
the
joinder
of
the
united
states
in
either
or
both
of
those.
mr.
kiechel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kiechel
no,
your
honor.
if
it’s
a
two-party
suit
which
does
--
mr.
kiechel
i’m
not
suggesting
that
that’s
necessary,
your
honor,
but
--
mr.
kiechel
your
question
is
whether
if
in
a
federal
court
--
mr.
kiechel
i
like
the
hypothetical
you
mention
because
it
does
permit
me
to
say
that
the
federal
district
court
would
of
course
apply
the
reserved
right
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
mr.
kiechel
with
respect
to
a
single
plaintiff,
single
person
asking
that
the
rights
of
the
united
states
be
declared
--
mr.
kiechel
well
--
mr.
kiechel
if
it’s
a
general
adjudication,
if
it
does
have
the
geographic
and
other
characteristics
of
a
general
adjudication
--
mr.
kiechel
oh
yes,
i
do.
i
think
the
language
of
appropriation
under
state
law
applies
to
both
the
administration
and
the
adjudication
parts
of
the
statute.
mr.
kiechel
i
believe
that
the
reserved
rights
were
withheld
by
congress,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
kiechel
yes
your
honor.
mr.
kiechel
yes
your
honor.
mr.
kiechel
no.
mr.
kiechel
yes.
mr.
kiechel
i
think
it
does
make
sense.
adjudication
of
rights
acquire
under
the
state
law
or
in
the
process
of
being
acquired.
my
difficulty
is
with
your
earlier
question
mr.
justice
white
is
that
you
characterized
as
a
declaratory
judgment
and
i
think
that
would
not
be
a
general
adjudication
because
it
would
not
permit
the
assertion
and
contesting
of
the
water
rights.
the
--
mr.
kiechel
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
kiechel
well,
the
procedure
involved
is
not
such
that
we
think
it
permits
a
general
adjudication.
it
just
isn’t
--
it
just
is
within
the
terms
of
the
type
or
proceeding
to
which
congress
consented,
and
we’re
also
are
concerned
about
the
supreme
court
of
colorado
in
its
opinion
with
respect
to
the
existence
of
reserved
rights
which
as
i’ve
point
to
on
the
map
or
a
matter
of
great
magnitude
in
both
of
these
cases,
in
the
water
division
5,
it
certainly
includes
a
great
part
of
the
area
of
that
area
of
colorado.
mr.
kiechel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kiechel
this
is
easier
said
than
done,
if
i
might
suggest.
i
personally
have
been
working
with
this
statute
since
a
lot
of
time
its
enactment
and
this
is
the
first
time
in
which
it
has
been
able
to
bring
it
before
this
court.
the
green
river
decision
mr.
balcomb
refers
to
was
a
remand
decision
under
the
federal
statute,
remand
by
federal
district
court
for
state
court
is
not
reviewable
by
appeal
or
otherwise,
so
that
the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes,
it
can
be.
dugan
v.
rank
is
probably
the
classic
example
of
how
long
it
takes.
that
case
was
started
on
the
san
joaquin
river
in
1947.
lengthy
proceedings
were
had.
the
united
states
was
joined
as
a
party.
it
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
finally
gets
to
this
court
in
1963,
and
the
court
held
that
it
was
all
for
naught,
there
not
having
been
jurisdiction
over
the
united
states.
mr.
kiechel
the
united
states
may
bring
a
suit
and
has
--
does
bring
suits
for
quieting
its
right
--
its
--
under
water
rights
as
a
plaintiff.
mr.
kiechel
yes,
united
states
could
initiate
a
suit
as
party
plaintiff.
mr.
kiechel
yes,
your
honor
if
--
as
to
that
case,
in
that
case,
there
was
--
that
is
correct,
i
agree
with
you.
my
–
yes
sir.
the
procedure
in
colorado
under
the
water
division
system
now
is
quite
different.
it
has
a
monthly
determination.
monthly,
these
lists
are
rendered
to
the
various
interested
persons,
person
under
the
colorado
statute
being
defined
to
include
the
united
states.
although,
the
continued
inability
of
a
colorado
law
to
consider
in
a
court
rightful
priorities
is
perhaps
it’s
most
basic
deficiency,
it’s
by
no
means
the
only
one
on
the
matter
of
adjudicating
federal
water
right
is
considered.
these
deficiencies
and
the
burdensome
nature
of
the
procedure
can
best
be
demonstrated
by
a
consideration
of
the
steps
which
i
would
like
to
run
over
very
quickly.
first,
the
water
clerk
not
later
than
fifth
of
each
month
sends
out
this
list
of
--
this
resume
and
then,
he
publishes
it
by
the
tenth
of
that
month,
and
anyone
who
wishes
to
oppose
a
particular
application
within
the
resume
must
file
with
the
water
clerk
a
verified
statement
of
opposition,
setting
forth
facts
why
it
should
not
be
granted
or
should
be
granted
only
conditionally.
but
the
last
day
of
the
second
month
following
the
month
in
which
the
application
was
filed
and
the
water
referee
of
water
division
5
or
the
water
division,
then
without
conducting
a
formal
hearing
investigates
the
truth
of
the
application
and
the
opposition
and
within
the
month,
following
the
month
in
which
the
oppositions
are
filed,
rules
on
the
application.
this
is
mailed
by
the
water
clerk
to
all
persons
who
file
either
a
statement
or
an
opposition
and
it
becomes
affective
upon
entry
subject
only
to
judicial
review.
so
that
the
statute
notices
only
those
parties
who
are
interested
in
the
applications
filed
in
a
particular
month.
the
only
water
rights
before
the
water
referee
are
those
who
which
an
application
is
been
filed.
the
only
parties
are
those
who’ve
taken
affirmative
action
to
be
heard
and
so
that,
even
though
the
referee’s
procedures
are
extremely
limited
and
involve
only
a
part
of
the
water
rights
and
the
parties
in
the
water
division,
the
burden
on
the
united
states
i
submit
is
tremendous.
mr.
kiechel
except
this
figure.
within
the
two-month
period
allowed
by
the
statute,
the
united
states
must
investigate
all
of
these
water
rights
within
water
division
5
and
evaluate
the
impact
of
these
applications
in
that
monthly
resume
upon
those
water
rights
and
that
is
a
rather
considerable
task.
mr.
kiechel
and
i
submit
that
perhaps
the
united
states,
because
of
its
authority
to
tie
may
resort
to
protect
the
opposition
for
lack
of
knowledge
or
time
and
certainly,
this
would
not
contribute
to
the
ordinary
procedure,
so
that
the
new
statute
does
provide
certain
complications.
mr.
kiechel
thank
you
sir.
mr.
kiechel
i
will
reserve
the
rest
--
remainder
of
my
time
if
you
please
sir.
mr.
kiechel
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
kiechel
i
wish
i
could
be
as
confident
in
saying
that
it
is
removable.
mr.
kiechel
yes,
we
have
your
honor.
it
was
tried
in
the
in
re
great
green
river
case
and
there,
in
a
lengthy
opinion,
judge
christiansen
in
that
court
held
it
not
to
be
removal
--
removable.
there
was
in
the
legislative
history
as
been
pointed
out
a
specific
right
of
removal
which
was
stricken.
mr.
kiechel
those
were
rights
including
reserved
rights
--
mr.
kiechel
--
on
federal
forest,
national
forest.
and
there
has
been
--
i
can’t
--
there
have
been
certain
case
is
removed
brought
under
this
statute,
but
most
to
those
had
been
where
the
government
officers
have
been
joined.
and
of
course
under
the
federal
removal
statute,
there’s
a
clear
right
to
remove
one
in
which
the
government
officer
is
a
party
defendant.
with
respect
to
the
procedure
in
colorado,
the
monthly
procedure
under
the
1969
act,
mr.
balcomb
makes
the
point
that
it
is
subject
to
judicial
review,
and
i
would
point
out
however
that
this
requirement
which
is
continued
or
this
prohibition
which
is
continued
in
colorado
law
whereby
the
no
right
prior
right
can
be
awarded
in
a
supplemental
on
going
adjudication
applies
to
the
judge
as
well
as
it
does
to
the
referee.
and
it’s
not
just
the
burdensome
nature
of
that
monthly
procedure
that
it’s
of
concern
with
respect
to
the
legislative
intent
on
666
and
is
relevant
to
it,
but
it
is
the
fact
that
it
is
more
administrating
than
judicial.
and
i
think
it’s
quite
clear
that
congress
in
enacting
the
statute
consenting
that
the
united
states
could
be
joined
had
in
line
a
judicial
proceeding.
and
so,
i
would
say
with
respect
to
the
--
what
question
about
the
conduct
of
the
united
states
as
plaintiff
that
was
the
united
states
does
as
plaintiff
is
not
dispositive
of
the
issue
before
the
court,
that
is
what
kind
of
proceeding
congress
consented
to
the
joinder
of
the
united
states
as
party
defendant.
i
will
say
however
in
addition
to
that
that
the
united
states
found
out
the
hard
way
about
a
general
adjudication
that
it
did
in
the
fallbrook
litigation
i
referred
to
earlier
on
santa
margarita
river
undertake
to
bring
the
kind
of
an
action.
mr.
justice
white
invited
a
question
earlier
that
is
an
action
against
only
the
principle
user,
and
it
was
there
to
determine.
this
is
not
a
666
case,
this
was
a
case
brought
by
the
united
states
as
a
plaintiff,
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
told
us
very
loudly
and
clearly
that
the
way
in
which
adjudication
could
be
done
was
to
join
all
water
users
on
that
river
system
and
have
a
contest
in
the
determination
among
all
users.
mr.
kiechel
i’m
saying
--
mr.
kiechel
i’m
sorry.
mr.
kiechel
i’m
saying
mr.
justice
brennan
that
congress
intended
to
consent
to
the
joinder
of
the
united
states
only
in
judicial
proceeding.
mr.
kiechel
yes
and
i
think
that
you
should
--
you
can
decide
by
reference
to
the
colorado
act
is
an
administrative
procedure.
mr.
kiechel
yes
in
--
mr.
kiechel
yes
your
honor.
mr.
kiechel
no,
i
think
there
good
and
sufficient
reasons
--
different
reasons
for
prevailing
in
both
if
your
honor
please.
the
first
case
as
was
discussed
involves
a
matter
of
the
river
system;
that
is
not
involved
in
the
second
case.
mr.
kiechel
well,
i
think
that
the
common
denominator
with
respect
to
colorado
law,
that
is
that
the
colorado
water
court
where
there
it
be
water
division
5
or
water
district
number
37
cannot
accord
the
united
states
its
true
priority,
it’s
rightful
priority
for
its
water
rights.
it
is
a
good
and
sufficient
basis
for
concluding
that
congress
could
not
have
intended
to
subject
the
united
states
to
either
such
procedure.
mr.
kiechel
yes
your
honor.
mr.
kiechel
if
the
government
loses
--
mr.
kiechel
it
loses
the
under
our
view
of
the
colorado
supreme
court
opinion,
possibly
it’s
right
to
present,
submit
and
prove
up
on
reserved
rights
of
the
united
states.
mr.
kiechel
that’s
quite
strongly
suggested
by
the
colorado
supreme
court.
mr.
kiechel
yes
your
honor.
mr.
kiechel
well
--
t
mr.
kiechel
i’m
quite
concerned
of
--
please
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
supreme
court
of
colorado
has
referred
to
the
reserved
rights
of
the
united
states
as
mysterious
and
causing
chaos
and
in
other
words
which
indicates
a
certainly
a
hostility
toward
those
rights.
mr.
kiechel
no
your
honor,
they’re
not.
mr.
kiechel
well,
they
were
quantified
in
arizona
v.
california
and
--
mr.
kiechel
well
sir,
the
oil
shale
reserve
is
an
example.
until
there
is
a
determination
or
science
permits
a
determination
of
how
oil
shale
can
be
recovered
or
how
oil
can
be
recovered
from
shale
in
commercial
quantities.
it’s
not
known
how
much
water
will
be
required
for
that
reserve.
mr.
kiechel
undetermined
--
mr.
kiechel
undetermined
in
certain
instances.
mr.
kiechel
i
agree.
mr.
kiechel
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
under
the
colorado
water
rights
determination
and
administration
act
of
1969,
the
70
water
districts
were
replaced
with
7
water
divisions.
water
division
5
includes
the
area
drained
by
the
colorado
river
and
its
tributaries,
excluding
the
gunnison
river
and
this
includes
the
former
water
district
37
and
eagle
river
watershed.
in
february
of
last
year,
the
attorney
general
received
by
mail
a
paper
signed
by
the
water
clerk
of
the
water
division
5,
directed
that
all
persons
interested
in
water
applications
in
said
division,
supplying
a
list
of
water
right
applications
filed
in
that
office.
the
paper
concluded
with
the
statement
that
the
recipient
had
until
the
last
day
of
march,
1970,
that
was
the
month
thereafter
that
preceded
the
notice,
to
file
with
the
water
clerk
a
verified
statement
of
opposition
to
any
such
application.
similar
notices
had
been
received
by
the
attorney
general
listing
water
rights
applications
filed
during
each
month
thereafter
in
water
division
5
and
in
water
division
4
and
6
as
well.
the
response
to
the
1969
--
december
1969
notice,
the
united
states
filed
a
motion
to
quash,
this
was
denied.
the
writ
was
applied
for
the
colorado
supreme
court
which
was
denied.
as
in
the
eagle
county
case
affected
by
the
proceedings
in
water
division
5
or
federal
water
rights
of
two
types,
property
rights
acquired
in
the
state
law
and
reserved
another
rights
based
on
federal
law.
because
of
its
size,
water
division
5
contains
a
multitude
of
federal
rights
to
determine,
demonstrate
their
magnitude
in
nature.
we’ve
prepared
a
map
on
which
has
been
delineated
the
boundaries
of
water
division
5
and
shows
the
various
federal
reserve
areas
within
that
division
5
before
national
forest
or
parts
thereof
in
green,
the
naval
oil
shale
reserve,
black,
national
park
or
part
of
the
rocky
mount
national
park
on
that
side
of
the
divided
in
red
--
mr.
kiechel
oh,
i’m
sorry
sir.
mr.
kiechel
yes
your
honor.
we
are
concerned
about
the
opinion
of
the
colorado
supreme
court
to
that
extent
--
in
that
respect
to
the
extent
that
the
colorado
supreme
court
discussed
the
question.
they
said
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
reviewing
winters
v.
united
states
in
1908
which
announced
the
reserved
right
doctrine,
federal
power
of
commission
v.
oregon
349,
and
arizona
v.
california
in
1963
in
373,
were
not
determinative
of
the
question.
the
--
mr.
kiechel
yes
your
honor,
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
kiechel
yes.
our
position
is
that
this
is
--
it
is
reviewable
and
the
supreme
court
has
held
that
the
decision
--
in
affect
the
supreme
court
of
colorado
said
that
when
this
matter
was
presented
to
them,
and
they
were
decided
on
the
basis
of
colorado
law.
and
they
referred
to
the
stockman
versus
leddy
case
which
mr.
justice
white
referred
to
in
their
opinion
and
said
they
would
have
to
overrule
that
decision
if
they
found
that
there
were
reserved
rights
in
--
of
the
united
states
in
the
state
of
colorado.
mr.
kiechel
well,
leddy
--
mr.
kiechel
leddy
relies
upon
the
enabling
act
of
congress,
and
it
--
the
--
mr.
kiechel
they
said
that
by
admitting
colorado
into
the
union
with
a
constitutional
provision
--
state
constitutional
provision
that
said
that
all
rights
of
the
water
of
the
state
of
colorado
were
property
of
the
people
and
subject
to
appropriation
under
state
law
that
the
united
states
is
precluded
from
asserting
a
claim
of
reserve
rights
within
colorado.
our
response
to
that,
if
your
honor
please
is
that
the
enabling
statute
required
in
section
4
that
the
people
of
the
territory
of
colorado
recognize
and
disclaim
any
right
to
the
public
lands
within
that
territory
and
recognize
that
that
was
a
matter
for
the
sole
and
exclusive
disposition
of
the
united
states.
this
was
a
specific
provision
of
the
enabling
act
and
that
act
was
--
and
that
provision
was
referred
to
once
again,
when
the
president
proclaimed
in
his
presidential
proclamation
after
the
colorado
constitution
was
adopted
that
the
colorado
was
a
state.
so
that
we
say
by
the
provision
of
the
enabling
act,
congress
reserved
to
itself
for
the
right
disposed
of
public
lands,
except
for
the
school
land
which
were
granted
to
the
territory
and
certain
other
lands
and
specified
amount
for
public
buildings.
and
we
say
there
in
furtherance
of
that,
that
thereafter
when
the
united
states
reserved
from
the
public
domain
for
a
specified
purpose
lands,
it
reserved
as
well
the
appurtenant
water
rights
to
fulfill
the
purposes
of
that
reservation.
and
that
carries
with
it
the
priority
of
the
date
of
the
creation
of
the
reservations
subject
and
i
wish
to
point
out,
subject
to
rights
vested
at
the
time
of
its
creation.
the
matter
of
the
legislative
history,
i
would
discuss
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
if
there
were
some
specific
episode
which
triggered
off
the
enactment
of
that
statute,
and
i
think
that
mr.
balcomb
has
referred
to
the
specific
episode
which
did.
it
was
a
proceeding
in
the
home
state
of
senator
mccarran,
the
sponsor
of
the
act
in
nevada
on
the
quinn
river,
and
it
involved
a
suit
for
administration
of
water
rights
already
having
been
adjudicated
under
a
state
court.
and
there,
the
united
states
had
purchased,
had
acquired
by
purchase,
certain
water
rights
on
the
quinn
river
and
this
is
the
primary
concern
of
senator
mccarran.
this
is
demonstrated
by
his
statements
on
the
floor
of
the
senate,
the
fact
that
the
--
he
says
it’s
--
to
allow
the
united
states
in
its
own
right
whereas
a
trustee,
those
were
acquired
for
indian
purposes,
to
have
a
better
right
than
the
former
owner
is
not
fair
and
just
as
to
the
other
water
users
on
the
stream.
and
of
course,
the
terms
of
the
statute
as
been
pointed
out
refers
to
appropriation
under
state
law,
and
in
an
appropriative
right
states
such
as
nevada
or
colorado,
the
state
here
involved.
the
only
way
a
private
citizen
can
acquire
a
water
right
is
by
application
of
the
water
to
a
beneficial
use.
that
water
right
becomes
fixed
in
amount
in
quality
by
that
act.
another
characteristic
of
an
appropriative
right
is
that
it
is
subject
to
loss
through
abandonment
or
non
use.
now,
concerning
the
legal
characteristics
of
an
appropriative
right,
the
second
sentence
of
the
mccarran
act
which
i
would
refer
the
court’s
attention
to
is
consistent
with
the
first,
only
if
the
consent
to
sue
was
restricted
to
rights
acquired
under
state
law.
and
second
sentence
of
the
mccarran
amendment
says,
the
united
states,
when
a
party
to
any
such
suit,
one
shall
be
deemed
to
a
waive
any
right
to
plead
state
laws
are
inapplicable,
or
that
the
united
states
is
not
amenable,
there
too
by
reason
of
its
sovereignty
and
too
shall
be
subject
to
the
judgments,
orders
and
decrees
of
the
court
having
jurisdiction,
and
may
obtain
review
thereof
in
the
same
manner
into
the
same
extent
as
a
private
individual
under
like
circumstances.
mr.
kiechel
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
kiechel
there
was
not.
the
express
terms
the
statute
referred
as
rights
acquire
under
state
law,
for
appropriation
under
state
law.
mr.
kiechel
that’s
correct
your
honor.
but
what
i
am
saying
is
that
these
terms
of
the
statute
by
appropriation
under
state
law,
by
purchase,
exchange
or
otherwise
is
the
means
by
which
a
private
individual
can
acquire
a
water
right.
and
it
was
that
type
of
right
which
the
united
states
had
acquired
in
this
quinn
river
situation
that
senator
mccarran
was
concerned
about
being
subject
to
adjudication
or
in
that
case,
administration
by
the
state
court
of
nevada.
mr.
kiechel
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
kiechel
must
it.
the
winters
v.
united
states
was
a
landmark
decision
of
this
court
--
mr.
kiechel
yes
indeed,
and
it
was
until
arizona
v.
california
that
it
was
extended
to
other
federal
reservations,
but
the
concept
of
a
right
other
than
an
appropriative
right,
a
right
rising
by
creation
of
a
federal
reservation
was
well
known
in
the
water
law
of
the
west
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
the
mccarran
amendment.
now,
with
keeping
in
mind
the
intent
of
the
sponsor
that
is
senator
mccarran
to
said
be
equally
that
federal
government
and
private
citizens
to
adjudication
of
water
rights
acquired
under
the
state
law,
and
the
express
terms
of
the
statute
designed
to
carry
out
that
intent
in
sharp
distinction
and
contrast
are
reserve
rights.
the
reserve
rights
as
i’ve
said
arise
by
creation
of
the
reservation
automatically.
they
don’t
require
the
application
of
water
to
use,
priority
states
from
the
date
that
they
withdraw
and
applies
to
future
as
well
as
existing
use.
and
the
--
in
summary
with
respect
to
the
legislative
intent,
i’d
say
that
there
being
no
expressed
provision
in
the
terms
of
the
statute,
including
reserve
rights,
nor
any
specific
intent
by
the
sponsor
of
the
amendment,
it
follows
that
it
was
not
within
the
contemplation
of
congress
that
they
be
included
in
this
state
court
adjudication.
mr.
kiechel
yes.
mr.
kiechel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kiechel
they
provide
for
the
joinder
of
the
united
states
in
either
or
both
of
those.
mr.
kiechel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kiechel
no,
your
honor.
if
it’s
a
two-party
suit
which
does
--
mr.
kiechel
i’m
not
suggesting
that
that’s
necessary,
your
honor,
but
--
mr.
kiechel
your
question
is
whether
if
in
a
federal
court
--
mr.
kiechel
i
like
the
hypothetical
you
mention
because
it
does
permit
me
to
say
that
the
federal
district
court
would
of
course
apply
the
reserved
right
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
mr.
kiechel
with
respect
to
a
single
plaintiff,
single
person
asking
that
the
rights
of
the
united
states
be
declared
--
mr.
kiechel
well
--
mr.
kiechel
if
it’s
a
general
adjudication,
if
it
does
have
the
geographic
and
other
characteristics
of
a
general
adjudication
--
mr.
kiechel
oh
yes,
i
do.
i
think
the
language
of
appropriation
under
state
law
applies
to
both
the
administration
and
the
adjudication
parts
of
the
statute.
mr.
kiechel
i
believe
that
the
reserved
rights
were
withheld
by
congress,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
kiechel
yes
your
honor.
mr.
kiechel
yes
your
honor.
mr.
kiechel
no.
mr.
kiechel
yes.
mr.
kiechel
i
think
it
does
make
sense.
adjudication
of
rights
acquire
under
the
state
law
or
in
the
process
of
being
acquired.
my
difficulty
is
with
your
earlier
question
mr.
justice
white
is
that
you
characterized
as
a
declaratory
judgment
and
i
think
that
would
not
be
a
general
adjudication
because
it
would
not
permit
the
assertion
and
contesting
of
the
water
rights.
the
--
mr.
kiechel
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
kiechel
well,
the
procedure
involved
is
not
such
that
we
think
it
permits
a
general
adjudication.
it
just
isn’t
--
it
just
is
within
the
terms
of
the
type
or
proceeding
to
which
congress
consented,
and
we’re
also
are
concerned
about
the
supreme
court
of
colorado
in
its
opinion
with
respect
to
the
existence
of
reserved
rights
which
as
i’ve
point
to
on
the
map
or
a
matter
of
great
magnitude
in
both
of
these
cases,
in
the
water
division
5,
it
certainly
includes
a
great
part
of
the
area
of
that
area
of
colorado.
mr.
kiechel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kiechel
this
is
easier
said
than
done,
if
i
might
suggest.
i
personally
have
been
working
with
this
statute
since
a
lot
of
time
its
enactment
and
this
is
the
first
time
in
which
it
has
been
able
to
bring
it
before
this
court.
the
green
river
decision
mr.
balcomb
refers
to
was
a
remand
decision
under
the
federal
statute,
remand
by
federal
district
court
for
state
court
is
not
reviewable
by
appeal
or
otherwise,
so
that
the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes,
it
can
be.
dugan
v.
rank
is
probably
the
classic
example
of
how
long
it
takes.
that
case
was
started
on
the
san
joaquin
river
in
1947.
lengthy
proceedings
were
had.
the
united
states
was
joined
as
a
party.
it
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
finally
gets
to
this
court
in
1963,
and
the
court
held
that
it
was
all
for
naught,
there
not
having
been
jurisdiction
over
the
united
states.
mr.
kiechel
the
united
states
may
bring
a
suit
and
has
--
does
bring
suits
for
quieting
its
right
--
its
--
under
water
rights
as
a
plaintiff.
mr.
kiechel
yes,
united
states
could
initiate
a
suit
as
party
plaintiff.
mr.
kiechel
yes,
your
honor
if
--
as
to
that
case,
in
that
case,
there
was
--
that
is
correct,
i
agree
with
you.
my
–
yes
sir.
the
procedure
in
colorado
under
the
water
division
system
now
is
quite
different.
it
has
a
monthly
determination.
monthly,
these
lists
are
rendered
to
the
various
interested
persons,
person
under
the
colorado
statute
being
defined
to
include
the
united
states.
although,
the
continued
inability
of
a
colorado
law
to
consider
in
a
court
rightful
priorities
is
perhaps
it’s
most
basic
deficiency,
it’s
by
no
means
the
only
one
on
the
matter
of
adjudicating
federal
water
right
is
considered.
these
deficiencies
and
the
burdensome
nature
of
the
procedure
can
best
be
demonstrated
by
a
consideration
of
the
steps
which
i
would
like
to
run
over
very
quickly.
first,
the
water
clerk
not
later
than
fifth
of
each
month
sends
out
this
list
of
--
this
resume
and
then,
he
publishes
it
by
the
tenth
of
that
month,
and
anyone
who
wishes
to
oppose
a
particular
application
within
the
resume
must
file
with
the
water
clerk
a
verified
statement
of
opposition,
setting
forth
facts
why
it
should
not
be
granted
or
should
be
granted
only
conditionally.
but
the
last
day
of
the
second
month
following
the
month
in
which
the
application
was
filed
and
the
water
referee
of
water
division
5
or
the
water
division,
then
without
conducting
a
formal
hearing
investigates
the
truth
of
the
application
and
the
opposition
and
within
the
month,
following
the
month
in
which
the
oppositions
are
filed,
rules
on
the
application.
this
is
mailed
by
the
water
clerk
to
all
persons
who
file
either
a
statement
or
an
opposition
and
it
becomes
affective
upon
entry
subject
only
to
judicial
review.
so
that
the
statute
notices
only
those
parties
who
are
interested
in
the
applications
filed
in
a
particular
month.
the
only
water
rights
before
the
water
referee
are
those
who
which
an
application
is
been
filed.
the
only
parties
are
those
who’ve
taken
affirmative
action
to
be
heard
and
so
that,
even
though
the
referee’s
procedures
are
extremely
limited
and
involve
only
a
part
of
the
water
rights
and
the
parties
in
the
water
division,
the
burden
on
the
united
states
i
submit
is
tremendous.
mr.
kiechel
except
this
figure.
within
the
two-month
period
allowed
by
the
statute,
the
united
states
must
investigate
all
of
these
water
rights
within
water
division
5
and
evaluate
the
impact
of
these
applications
in
that
monthly
resume
upon
those
water
rights
and
that
is
a
rather
considerable
task.
mr.
kiechel
and
i
submit
that
perhaps
the
united
states,
because
of
its
authority
to
tie
may
resort
to
protect
the
opposition
for
lack
of
knowledge
or
time
and
certainly,
this
would
not
contribute
to
the
ordinary
procedure,
so
that
the
new
statute
does
provide
certain
complications.
mr.
kiechel
thank
you
sir.
mr.
kiechel
i
will
reserve
the
rest
--
remainder
of
my
time
if
you
please
sir.
mr.
kiechel
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
kiechel
i
wish
i
could
be
as
confident
in
saying
that
it
is
removable.
mr.
kiechel
yes,
we
have
your
honor.
it
was
tried
in
the
in
re
great
green
river
case
and
there,
in
a
lengthy
opinion,
judge
christiansen
in
that
court
held
it
not
to
be
removal
--
removable.
there
was
in
the
legislative
history
as
been
pointed
out
a
specific
right
of
removal
which
was
stricken.
mr.
kiechel
those
were
rights
including
reserved
rights
--
mr.
kiechel
--
on
federal
forest,
national
forest.
and
there
has
been
--
i
can’t
--
there
have
been
certain
case
is
removed
brought
under
this
statute,
but
most
to
those
had
been
where
the
government
officers
have
been
joined.
and
of
course
under
the
federal
removal
statute,
there’s
a
clear
right
to
remove
one
in
which
the
government
officer
is
a
party
defendant.
with
respect
to
the
procedure
in
colorado,
the
monthly
procedure
under
the
1969
act,
mr.
balcomb
makes
the
point
that
it
is
subject
to
judicial
review,
and
i
would
point
out
however
that
this
requirement
which
is
continued
or
this
prohibition
which
is
continued
in
colorado
law
whereby
the
no
right
prior
right
can
be
awarded
in
a
supplemental
on
going
adjudication
applies
to
the
judge
as
well
as
it
does
to
the
referee.
and
it’s
not
just
the
burdensome
nature
of
that
monthly
procedure
that
it’s
of
concern
with
respect
to
the
legislative
intent
on
666
and
is
relevant
to
it,
but
it
is
the
fact
that
it
is
more
administrating
than
judicial.
and
i
think
it’s
quite
clear
that
congress
in
enacting
the
statute
consenting
that
the
united
states
could
be
joined
had
in
line
a
judicial
proceeding.
and
so,
i
would
say
with
respect
to
the
--
what
question
about
the
conduct
of
the
united
states
as
plaintiff
that
was
the
united
states
does
as
plaintiff
is
not
dispositive
of
the
issue
before
the
court,
that
is
what
kind
of
proceeding
congress
consented
to
the
joinder
of
the
united
states
as
party
defendant.
i
will
say
however
in
addition
to
that
that
the
united
states
found
out
the
hard
way
about
a
general
adjudication
that
it
did
in
the
fallbrook
litigation
i
referred
to
earlier
on
santa
margarita
river
undertake
to
bring
the
kind
of
an
action.
mr.
justice
white
invited
a
question
earlier
that
is
an
action
against
only
the
principle
user,
and
it
was
there
to
determine.
this
is
not
a
666
case,
this
was
a
case
brought
by
the
united
states
as
a
plaintiff,
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
told
us
very
loudly
and
clearly
that
the
way
in
which
adjudication
could
be
done
was
to
join
all
water
users
on
that
river
system
and
have
a
contest
in
the
determination
among
all
users.
mr.
kiechel
i’m
saying
--
mr.
kiechel
i’m
sorry.
mr.
kiechel
i’m
saying
mr.
justice
brennan
that
congress
intended
to
consent
to
the
joinder
of
the
united
states
only
in
judicial
proceeding.
mr.
kiechel
yes
and
i
think
that
you
should
--
you
can
decide
by
reference
to
the
colorado
act
is
an
administrative
procedure.
mr.
kiechel
yes
in
--
mr.
kiechel
yes
your
honor.
mr.
kiechel
no,
i
think
there
good
and
sufficient
reasons
--
different
reasons
for
prevailing
in
both
if
your
honor
please.
the
first
case
as
was
discussed
involves
a
matter
of
the
river
system;
that
is
not
involved
in
the
second
case.
mr.
kiechel
well,
i
think
that
the
common
denominator
with
respect
to
colorado
law,
that
is
that
the
colorado
water
court
where
there
it
be
water
division
5
or
water
district
number
37
cannot
accord
the
united
states
its
true
priority,
it’s
rightful
priority
for
its
water
rights.
it
is
a
good
and
sufficient
basis
for
concluding
that
congress
could
not
have
intended
to
subject
the
united
states
to
either
such
procedure.
mr.
kiechel
yes
your
honor.
mr.
kiechel
if
the
government
loses
--
mr.
kiechel
it
loses
the
under
our
view
of
the
colorado
supreme
court
opinion,
possibly
it’s
right
to
present,
submit
and
prove
up
on
reserved
rights
of
the
united
states.
mr.
kiechel
that’s
quite
strongly
suggested
by
the
colorado
supreme
court.
mr.
kiechel
yes
your
honor.
mr.
kiechel
well
--
t
mr.
kiechel
i’m
quite
concerned
of
--
please
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
supreme
court
of
colorado
has
referred
to
the
reserved
rights
of
the
united
states
as
mysterious
and
causing
chaos
and
in
other
words
which
indicates
a
certainly
a
hostility
toward
those
rights.
mr.
kiechel
no
your
honor,
they’re
not.
mr.
kiechel
well,
they
were
quantified
in
arizona
v.
california
and
--
mr.
kiechel
well
sir,
the
oil
shale
reserve
is
an
example.
until
there
is
a
determination
or
science
permits
a
determination
of
how
oil
shale
can
be
recovered
or
how
oil
can
be
recovered
from
shale
in
commercial
quantities.
it’s
not
known
how
much
water
will
be
required
for
that
reserve.
mr.
kiechel
undetermined
--
mr.
kiechel
undetermined
in
certain
instances.
mr.
kiechel
i
agree.
