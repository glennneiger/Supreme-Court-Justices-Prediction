justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
leddy
purported
to
say
what
federal
law
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
just
for
that
under
colorado
law
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
united
states
didn’t
reserve
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
excuse
me.
the
section
distinguishes
between
adjudication
of
rights
and
the
administration
of
rights,
isn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
now
--
justice
byron
r.
white
on
its
face
it
does?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
distinguishes
between
the
two?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
--
on
the
adjudication
part
it
says
“for
the
adjudication
that
united
states
maybe
joined
in
any
suit
that
adjudication
of
rights
is
for
use
of
water
or
river
system
or
the
source.”
now,
would
you
think
that
that
would
be
consent
for
someone
to
sue
the
united
states
in
the
federal
district
court
for
a
declaratory
judgment
as
to
whether
or
not
the
united
states
has
any
reserved
rights
in
the
colorado
river
system?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let’s
assume
he
satisfied
the
--
he
brought
in
everybody
in
the
state
of
colorado
into
the
lawsuit?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i
know.
but
let’s
assume
you
insisted
and
he
complied?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
any
other
court,
a
declaratory
judgment
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
how
about
consent
to
sue,
does
the
united
states
consent
to
that
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
serves
his
defendant
anybody
that
you
think
ought
to
be
served,
including
the
united
states.
now,
my
question
is,
does
this
statute
give
consent
for
such
a
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
seems
like
it
would
right
in
the
paragraph
one
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
don’t
say
that
this
--
at
least,
in
terms
the
adjudication
of
rights
are
part
of
this,
you
wouldn’t
say
that
the
united
states
has
not
given
consent
to
adjudicating
reserved
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
don’t
think
that
then
that
there
would
be
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
court
in
this
case
that
i
pose
to
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me,
if
i
get
that
correct.
then
you
take
the
language
where
it
appears
in
united
states
is
the
owner
of
process
of
the
water
rights
by
appropriation
and
the
state
law
as
modifying
both
the
adjudication
of
rights
and
to
the
administration,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
what
would
be
--
the
legislative
history
supports
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that’s
a
crude
way
to
instruct
the
statute,
isn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it’s
talking
about
in
paragraph
two.
it
says
for
the
administration
of
rights
where
it
appears
the
united
states
is
the
owner
of
or
is
in
the
process
of
acquiring
rights
by
appropriation?
now,
add
that
on
the
paragraph
one,
for
the
adjudication
of
rights
to
the
use
of
water
of
the
river
system
where
it
appears
the
united
states
is
the
owner
of
or
is
in
the
process
of
acquiring
water
way.
it
doesn’t
make
a
great
deal
of
sense,
doesn’t
it?
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
i
don’t
want
to
take
your
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
difference,
any
difference
if
anybody
else
such
has
water
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
that
--
that
was
tantamount
to
a
--
an
assertion
by
them
that
the
colorado
court
had
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
have
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
removed
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
balcomb,
may
i
ask
before
i
learn
too
much
about,
i
like
to
pursue
it
just
one
question
further.
in
connection
with
reserved
rights
which
you
seem
to
say
your
mind
isn’t
closed
against
anyway.
would
the
regular
rules
of
appropriation
apply
to
those
reserved
rights
in
terms
of
what
kind
of
conduct
it
takes
to
amount
to
an
appropriation
to
a
an
appropriation
for
beneficial
use?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
they
aren’t
using
the
water
for
anything
at
the
moment?
justice
byron
r.
white
i’ve
never
heard
of
the
--
that
took
some
doing,
didn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
far
as
the
western
slopers
were
concerned?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
would
just
be
a
matter
i
suppose
to
the
probably
governed
by
federal
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
balcomb,
can
i
ask
you
another
question
please.
if
the
united
states
wanted
to
reserve
--
wanted
to
remove,
let’s
assume
that
you’re
right
about
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
united
states
then
wanted
to
remove
the
case
to
the
federal
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
what
if
it’s
a
reserved
right
that
you’re
arguing
about?
united
states
asked
to
have
remove
the
adjudication
of
its
federal
right
to
water?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
on
the
face
--
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
it
is
a
removable
issue,
isn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
the
consent
statute
covers
both
of
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
administration
mean
in
the
--
what’s
the
difference
between
adjudication
and
administration
of
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
assert
your
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
this
proceeding
we
have
going
here
is
to
establish
a
right,
isn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
there’s
a
right
exist
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
adjudicating?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
in
the
colorado
any
priorities
other
than
time
of
appropriation,
if
you
have
any
priorities
with
respect
to
the
type
of
use?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
assume,
there’s
a
conflict
between
people
for
industrial
use
as
against
irrigation
or
as
against
municipal
use?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
once
it’s
adjudicated,
they
own
it
till
somebody
condemns
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
are
rather
mysterious?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
were
until
you
sat
down
and
quantified
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
did
you
find
that
in
the
least
time,
i
just
wanted
to
case
that
you’re
rights
what
you
say
you
reserve
rights
are
on
equal
river
system?
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
mysterious
isn’t
the
word,
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
very
good
example,
where
there
is
very
--
an
unknown.
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
leddy
purported
to
say
what
federal
law
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
just
for
that
under
colorado
law
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
united
states
didn’t
reserve
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
excuse
me.
the
section
distinguishes
between
adjudication
of
rights
and
the
administration
of
rights,
isn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
now
--
justice
byron
r.
white
on
its
face
it
does?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
distinguishes
between
the
two?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
--
on
the
adjudication
part
it
says
“for
the
adjudication
that
united
states
maybe
joined
in
any
suit
that
adjudication
of
rights
is
for
use
of
water
or
river
system
or
the
source.”
now,
would
you
think
that
that
would
be
consent
for
someone
to
sue
the
united
states
in
the
federal
district
court
for
a
declaratory
judgment
as
to
whether
or
not
the
united
states
has
any
reserved
rights
in
the
colorado
river
system?
justice
byron

white
well,
let’s
assume
he
satisfied
the
--
he
brought
in
everybody
in
the
state
of
colorado
into
the
lawsuit?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i
know.
but
let’s
assume
you
insisted
and
he
complied?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
any
other
court,
a
declaratory
judgment
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
how
about
consent
to
sue,
does
the
united
states
consent
to
that
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
serves
his
defendant
anybody
that
you
think
ought
to
be
served,
including
the
united
states.
now,
my
question
is,
does
this
statute
give
consent
for
such
a
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
seems
like
it
would
right
in
the
paragraph
one
here.
justice
byron

white
so,
you
don’t

you
