mr.
binkley,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
this
while
he
was
a
fugitive?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
now
when
you
just
said
that
he
claims
that
he
was
incarcerated
in
prison
when
this
took
place,
i’m
not
sure
what
the
antecedent
to
this
was,
but
he
wasn’t
incarcerated
when
the
bank
robbery
occurred,
was
he
or
when
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
could
be
part
of
a
conspiracy
in
that
connection,
a
preexisting
conspiracy,
could
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
covered
that
he
may
have
intended
to
cover
many
bank
robberies,
but
was
interrupted
by
his
recapture?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
does
that
add
to
the
government’s
burden
--
burden
to
prove
every
element
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
is
that
an
additional
burden?
i’m
having
difficulty
seeing
what
your
point
is
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
there
any
request
for
an
instruction
as
to
the
proof
concerning
the
substantive
acts
that
took
place
after
the
rearrest
and
recapture
of
the
petitioner?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
request
for
an
instruction
on
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
certainly
--
it
would
have
been
appropriate
to
request
and
appropriate
to
grant
an
instruction
specifically
aimed
at
the
substantive
events
after
his
recapture,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
but
if
you’d
asked
for
that
instruction
and
it
had
been
denied,
your
arguments
that
you’re
making
now
would
have
a
good
deal
of
more
force
at
least
with
me,
but
you
didn’t
ask
for
such
an
instruction?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
am
i
correct
that
in
the
prosecutor’s
opening
statement
to
the
jury,
he
said
that
there
was
no
intent
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
show
that
bostic
had
any
part
in
the
murder
or
conspiracy
to
commit
murder?
he
affirmatively
told
the
jury
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
after
miss
rosenberg.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
my
impression
of
the
record
that
his
opening
statement
made
that
very
clear.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
was
in
connection
with
statement
i
think
that
at
that
point,
bostic
goes
out
of
the
conspiracy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
ms.
rosenberg.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
you
raise
your
voice.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
ms.
rosenberg,
perhaps
you
should
lower
the
podium
where
you
can
get
closer
to
the
microphone.
you’re
going
the
wrong
way.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
have
some
very
tall
men
here
today.
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
i
was
mistaken
when
i
said
it
was
opening
statement,
it
was
the
argument
of
the
jury.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wasn’t
there
another
at
least
arguable
response
to
that,
namely
that
the
government
conceded,
well
more
than
conceded,
asserted
flatly
that
after
he
returned
to
prison
on
his
recapture,
he
was
out
of
the
conspiracy.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
was
probably
at
least
as
strong
as
an
instruction
to
the
court
since
it
came
right
through
the
prosecutor?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
binkley,
do
you
have
anything
more?
you
have
about
nine
minutes
if
you
wish.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
but
didn’t
it
help
you
quite
a
bit
to
have
him
cut
loose
from
this,
at
least
very
much
premeditated
murder,
motivated
murder?
it
would
help
him
a
lot
better,
didn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.

thank
you
