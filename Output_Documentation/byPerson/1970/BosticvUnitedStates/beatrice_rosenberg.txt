ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
maybe
this
case
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i’m
sorry.
i’m
saying
that,
i
think
maybe
we
inadvertently
mislead
the
court.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i’ve
gone
the
wrong
way.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
it
is
going

ms.

this
quotation
on
page
12
to
13
in
our
brief
is
in
volume
22
of
the
record
which
got
lost
at
that
time.
we
didn’t
have
as
a
matter
fact
at
the
time
our
brief
in
our
opposition
was
filed.
we
also
had
filed
a
separate
brief
on
behalf
of
the
other
petitioners
which
stated
the
facts
and
so
that
we
didn’t
file
a
separate
statement
of
the
facts
as
to
bostic,
but
i
accept
what
the
court
of
appeals
had
said
and
there
was
a
mistake
in
the
court
of
appeals.
it
said
that
the
charge
was
conspiracy
to
rob
banks
and
commit
murder.
now,
the
charge
was
the
conspiracy
to
rob
banks.
it
did
allege
as
one
of
the
overt
acts
that
beard
and
etheridge
committed
murder,
but
when
you
go
through
the
whole
record,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
it
was
perfectly
clear
to
the
jury
that
bostic
was
not
regarded
as
involved
in
the
murder
and
that
appears
not
only
from
page,
that’s
the
opening
argument
at
the
close
of
the
case
that
we
quote
on
page
12
to
13
of
the
case.
i
don’t
have
to
tell
the
court
how
important
that
is
to
a
jury,
12
to13
of
our
brief.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
it
was
the
argument
of
the
jury,
it
was
the
opening
argument
at
the
close
of
the
case,
but
that
appeared
earlier
the
trial
too
and
i
call
your
attention
to
voir
dire
of
the
jury
when
they’re
being
picked
and
that
took
a
lot
of
time
because
of
the
murder,
there
were
20
challenges,
but
i
think
its
four
times
as
they
were
groups
called
up.
petitioner’s
counsel
said,
and
an
example
is
at
page
170
of
the
record.
well,
he
made
a
statement,
“the
fact
that
one
of
the
defendant
or
more
than
one
of
the
defendants
are
charged
with
minor
counts
and
are
being
tried
along
with
other
persons
causing
death,
would
that
influence
you.”
and
then
the
court
said,
“well,
let
me
explain
this.”
and
it
goes
on
and
says,
“in
count
eight,
the
defendants
beard
and
gary
etheridge
are
charged
with
causing
the
death
of
larry
ferguson.
now,
in
the
other
counts
of
the
indictment,
other
defendants
are
charged
with
offenses
involving
bank
robberies
and
a
conspiracy
to
commit
bank
robbery.
now,
with
the
fact
that
these
two
defendants
are
charged
with
causing
the
death
of
a
person
make
it
difficult
to
give
a
fair
trial
and
to
find
the
defendants
to
the
other
counts
not
guilty
and
this
is
i
say
was
repeated
four
times
to
the
voir
dire.
the
government
counsel
in
his
opening
statement
said
how
he
was
going
to
proceed
in
the
case.
he
said,
“we’re
going
to
present
the
proof
of
the
murder
first.
the
murder
that
was
committed
by
beard
and
acquiesced
him
or
counseled,
stewarded
by
etheridge
and
so
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
that
murder
proof
was
as
to
those
two
and
not
all
as
to
the
others.
now,
after
the
murder,
there
is
no
co-conspirator
declaration.
what
there
is,
is
a
dying
declaration
by
ferguson,
but
as
to
the
murder
aspect,
we
don’t
get
co-conspirator
declarations
very
much
at
all
except
to
a
limited
extent
perhaps
in
relation
to
etheridge
and
certainly
reading
the
case
as
a
whole,
they
were
not
imputed
to
this
petitioner.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
which
suggests
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
relation
to
this
petition,
there
aren’t
very
many
to
co-conspirators
to
declarations
that
have
any
significance.
aside
from
the
murder,
the
proof
was
like
this.
juan
leeman
testified,
he
was
named
originally
as
a
defendant,
testified
that
in
april,
he
and
etheridge
decided.
they‘ve
been
in
robbing
merchandise
before.
they
cited
that
wasn’t
any
good
because
you
can
get
caught
with
the
merchandise
money
was
safer,
that
they
were
going
to
the
bank
robberies,
but
they
weren’t
going
to
do
it
themselves,
they
would
get
people
to
do
it
for
them.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
as
to
bostic,
i
don’t
think
so.
i
do
not
think
so.
on
that,
let
me
say,
that
i
think
a
question
of
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
i
think
in
relation
to
bostic,
i
think
the
question
of
withdrawal
from
the
conspiracy
your
honor
is
a
question
of
fact.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
it’s
not
only
that
he
was
in
jail
because
for
example
beard
was
in
jail
for
a
few
days
and
let
out
on
bail.
beard
was
arrested
when
--
bostic
was
taken
because
bostic
was
found
in
his
house.
now,
beard
was
arrested
at
that
point
and
then
was
out
on
bail
and
it
was
after
he
was
out
on
bail
that
they
committed
the
third
robbery
and
that
they
committed
the
murder.
but
the
question
as
to
bostic
is
a
question
of
withdrawal
and
that’s
a
question
of
fact
and
on
these
facts,
i
think
there
really
isn’t
any
doubt
that
he
had
very
nearly
been
withdrawn
from
the
conspiracy,
removed,
i
don’t
know
if
it
was
a
voluntary
withdrawal,
but
he
had
withdrawn.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes.
that’s
--
that
quotation
on
page
12
and
13
of
our
brief.
it’s
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
there
wasn’t
any
instruction
specifically
on
it.
there
was
an
instruction
which
is
that
somebody
could
withdraw
and
there
wasn’t
any
instruction
on
the
consequences
of
withdrawal,
although
i
think
it
is
evident
that
the
person
in
that
is
if
he
had
withdrawn,
he
wouldn’t
be
held.
but
what
the
judge
did
say
and
what
the
theory
of
this
case
is
was
that
bostic
had
been
shown
to
be
a
member
of
the
conspiracy
to
rob
banks
on
plenty
of
evidence
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
murder.
plenty
of
evidence
of
what
he
did
and
what
he
and
self
said
to
his
girlfriend
in
court
long
before
he
was
apprehended.
this
first
robbery
occurred
in
april
and
then
they
went
down
to
florida,
a
group
of
them.
at
this
point,
beard
comes
into
the
picture.
apparently
he’s
a
friend
of
fergusons
and
then
a
whole
group
of
them
go
up
and
try
to
rob
a
bank
in
orlinda,
that’s
includes
this
petitioner,
at
orlinda,
tennessee,
but
that
bank
robbery
was
unsuccessful
because
an
employee
the
bank
lived
above
it,
heard
the
noise.
and
then
they
come
back
and
in
june,
petitioner
is
arrested.
now
at
that
point
he’s
out.
there’s
no
question
i
think
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case
and
i
think
there
isn’t
any
question
the
jury
so
understood.
it
happened
to
be
as
highly
selective
jury
in
its
verdict
even
as
to
the
others.
and
for
example
is,
in
august
bank
robbery
where
he
was
charged
but
the
jury
wasn’t
satisfied
with
the
proof
as
to
that
robbery
so
the
only
person
who
was
convicted
in
relation
to
that
conspiracy
was
beard
who
was
shown
to
have
had
the
money
from
the
robbery
in
his
actual
possession.
and
while
the
judge
did
not
specifically
charge
that
the
murder
was
not
to
be
considered
in
relation
to
petitioner,
he
did
charge
in
relation
to
statements
as
to
others
that
as
--
and
that’s
at
556
of
the
record.
the
statements,
testimonies
been
offered
relating
to
statements
made
by
one
or
more
of
the
defendants
on
one
or
more
occasions.
testimony
being
of
the
witness
is
leeman
who
test
--
who
was
a
member
of
the
conspiracy
and
testified
to
acts
either
that
he
knew
about
the
planning
or
that
had
been
told
to
him
right
after
the
robbery.
connie,
who
relates
only
to
statements
by
beard
from
and
that’s
petitioners
girlfriend
and
letos
who
was
with
the
group
in
florida
and
testified
to
statements
they
made
there.
so
that
we
do
not
have
as
to
this
petitioner
the
basic
rules
going
into
questions
of
proving
his
part
in
the
conspiracy
for
the
time
he
was
in
it
by
statements
of
co-conspirators.
the
major
part
of
the
proof
against
him
came
from
his
co-conspirator
leeman
and
his
own
personal
admissions
to
his
friends.
now,
there
was
some
other
co-conspirators
statements
admitted.
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
when
there
was
an
attempt
to
prove
some
of
the
statements
that
ferguson
had
made
to
some
of
the
girls,
at
that
point,
page
148
of
the
record,
counsel
have
checked
it
and
that
didn't
come
in
in
that
way.
some
other
statements
by
ferguson
came
in
at
another
time.
other
complaints
that
are
made
by
petitioner
about
hearsay
evidence
don’t
mention
him
at
all.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
main
complaint
is
in
relation
to
testimony
regarding
a
young
man
himself
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
petitioner,
so
that
this
case
really
does
not
involve
the
grunewald
question
or
the
co-conspirator
rule.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no
and
our
brief
in
opposition
as
a
matter
of
fact.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
can
only
say
your
honor,
you
have
to
read
the
record
in
regard
to
bostic.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
that’s
right,
i
think,
as
i
say,
there
is
a
combination
of
things
the
--
we
didn’t
concentrate
on
bostic
and
i’m
afraid
the
court
of
appeals
didn’t
either
and
particularly
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
about
bostic
is
not
sustainable
in
my
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
i
think
that
the
question
is
whether
bostic’s
conviction
is
sustainable?
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
right.
i
think
that
the
judgment
is
clearly
sustainable.
the
opinion
is
not.
on
these
facts,
i
don’t
say
that
there
weren’t
other
facts
where
somebody
in
jail
might
be
held
to
be
a
member
of
the
conspiracy.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
on
these
facts,
no.
the
opinion
is
not
sustainable.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
we
do
know
that
the
jury
found
other
overt
acts.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
no
they
were
not
special
verdicts,
but
they
were
counts
of
the
indictment
which
charged
this
first
bank
robbery
which
petitioner
was
in
and
charged
receiving
the
money
from
that
bank
robbery
which
was
split
five
ways.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
i
don’t
think
we
do
because
it’s
perfectly
clear
that
the
jury
found
on
ample,
more
than
ample
evidence
that
petitioner
committed
this
bordeaux
bank
robbery.
now,
he
was
charged
with
being
a
member
of
the
conspiracy
which
to
rob
banks.
the
judge
by
the
way
specifically
refused
to
charge
on
pinkerton
in
this
case.
he
said,
in
doing
that,
he
said,
the
murder
in
this
case
is
not
charged
as
an
object
of
the
conspiracy,
it’s
charged
as
one
of
the
overt
acts.
in
the
face
of
the
fact
that
the
jury
clearly
found
that
these
people
were
in
a
conspiracy,
they
commit
the
bordeaux
robbery
and
something
else
they
didn’t
a
specific
of
finding
about
the
bank
robberies
but
they
clearly
found
that
because
those
were
substantive
of
events
charged
to
jury
as
to
those
substantive
offense
since
you
can’t
consider
co-conspiracy
statements.
he
went
beyond
what
he
was
required
to
do,
but
he
did
so
charge
and
as
i
say
the
evidence
is
overwhelming
that
they
did
do
this
bank
robbery.
then
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
the
jury
found
the
conspiracy
to
rob
banks
and
at
least
the
overt
act
of
the
bordeaux
robbery
whether
in
addition
it
also
found
the
murder
would
be
unimportant.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
i
think
that
that
is
and
i
think
that
is
very
clear.
i
also
think
that
if
you
go
through
the
record
which
you
can’t
do
when
you
start
just
putting
together
all
the
objections
in
the
appendix
and
now
it
goes
around
them,
i
think
if
one
goes
through
the
record,
one
can
see
that
the
government
really
did
try
to
keep
the
event
compartmentalized.
they
said
clearly
in
the
beginning,
were
going
to
present
the
evidence
of
the
murder
first
and
the
murder
concerns
beard
and
etheridge,
those
only
--
those
two.
then
later
on
when
there’s
some
attempt
by
beard
to
imply
that
self
which
again
a
young
man
who
wasn’t,
didn’t
even
come
up
on
appeal
might
have
tried
to
murder
him.
they
said,
“well,
he
wasn’t
even
charged
with
the
murder.
it
was
made
clear
to
us
at
trial
that
while
it
was
an
overt
act
in
doings
of
the
conspiracy
with
etheridge
as
the
center
of
the
conspiracy,
that
don’t
come
through
the
trial
also.
it
was
perfectly
clear
throughout
the
trial
that
nobody
was
saying
that
not
only
bostic,
but
self
and
some
of
the
other
defendants,
nobody
was
accusing
anybody
but
beard
and
etheridge
as
being
responsible
for
the
murder
and
with
etheridge
the
real
center
of
the
conspiracy.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes.
that
is
our
position
because
our
position
is
that
it
is
perfectly
clear
on
this
record
in
every
way
that
bostic
was
not
charged
directly
or
by
implication
with
the
murder.
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
perfectly
clear
on
this
record
that
bostic
was
properly
convicted
both
of
the
bordeaux
bank
robbery
with
which
he
was
charged
and
winged
with
being
a
member
of
the
conspiracy
for
the
length
of
time
that
he
was
out
of
jail.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it’s
significant
that
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
i
think
in
his
brief
he
says
the
question
is,
whether
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
charged
him
as
being
responsible
for
the
murder.
and
although
the
court
of
appeals
really
says
is,
that
it
wasn’t
--
there
was
no
showing
of
affirmative
withdrawal
from
the
conspiracy,
i
don’t
think,
they
said
he
did
it
or
really
had
any
part
in
it
and
they
just
said
technically,
legally
he
had
withdrawn.
i
think
that
was
wrong
because
i
think
that
on
these
facts
would
show,
he
was
taken
over
the
penitentiary
and
there’s
absolutely
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
anybody
even
visited
him
after
that.
i
think
it
would
be
wrong
to
impute
the
murder
to
him,
but
i
don’t
think
it
was
done
at
the
trial.
i
think
it
was
made
perfectly
clear
that
he
wasn’t
involved.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
maybe
this
case
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i’m
sorry.
i’m
saying
that,
i
think
maybe
we
inadvertently
mislead
the
court.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i’ve
gone
the
wrong
way.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
it
is
going
down.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
this
quotation
on
page
12
to
13
in
our
brief
is
in
volume
22
of
the
record
which
got
lost
at
that
time.
we
didn’t
have
as
a
matter
fact
at
the
time
our
brief
in
our
opposition
was
filed.
we
also
had
filed
a
separate
brief
on
behalf
of
the
other
petitioners
which
stated
the
facts
and
so
that
we
didn’t
file
a
separate
statement
of
the
facts
as
to
bostic,
but
i
accept
what
the
court
of
appeals
had
said
and
there
was
a
mistake
in
the
court
of
appeals.
it
said
that
the
charge
was
conspiracy
to
rob
banks
and
commit
murder.
now,
the
charge
was
the
conspiracy
to
rob
banks.
it
did
allege
as
one
of
the
overt
acts
that
beard
and
etheridge
committed
murder,
but
when
you
go
through
the
whole
record,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
it
was
perfectly
clear
to
the
jury
that
bostic
was
not
regarded
as
involved
in
the
murder
and
that
appears
not
only
from
page,
that’s
the
opening
argument
at
the
close
of
the
case
that
we
quote
on
page
12
to
13
of
the
case.
i
don’t
have
to
tell
the
court
how
important
that
is
to
a
jury,
12
to13
of
our
brief.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
it
was
the
argument
of
the
jury,
it
was
the
opening
argument
at
the
close
of
the
case,
but
that
appeared
earlier
the
trial
too
and
i
call
your
attention
to
voir
dire
of
the
jury
when
they’re
being
picked
and
that
took
a
lot
of
time
because
of
the
murder,
there
were
20
challenges,
but
i
think
its
four
times
as
they
were
groups
called
up.
petitioner’s
counsel
said,
and
an
example
is
at
page
170
of
the
record.
well,
he
made
a
statement,
“the
fact
that
one
of
the
defendant
or
more
than
one
of
the
defendants
are
charged
with
minor
counts
and
are
being
tried
along
with
other
persons
causing
death,
would
that
influence
you.”
and
then
the
court
said,
“well,
let
me
explain
this.”
and
it
goes
on
and
says,
“in
count
eight,
the
defendants
beard
and
gary
etheridge
are
charged
with
causing
the
death
of
larry
ferguson.
now,
in
the
other
counts
of
the
indictment,
other
defendants
are
charged
with
offenses
involving
bank
robberies
and
a
conspiracy
to
commit
bank
robbery.
now,
with
the
fact
that
these
two
defendants
are
charged
with
causing
the
death
of
a
person
make
it
difficult
to
give
a
fair
trial
and
to
find
the
defendants
to
the
other
counts
not
guilty
and
this
is
i
say
was
repeated
four
times
to
the
voir
dire.
the
government
counsel
in
his
opening
statement
said
how
he
was
going
to
proceed
in
the
case.
he
said,
“we’re
going
to
present
the
proof
of
the
murder
first.
the
murder
that
was
committed
by
beard
and
acquiesced
him
or
counseled,
stewarded
by
etheridge
and
so
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
that
murder
proof
was
as
to
those
two
and
not
all
as
to
the
others.
now,
after
the
murder,
there
is
no
co-conspirator
declaration.
what
there
is,
is
a
dying
declaration
by
ferguson,
but
as
to
the
murder
aspect,
we
don’t
get
co-conspirator
declarations
very
much
at
all
except
to
a
limited
extent
perhaps
in
relation
to
etheridge
and
certainly
reading
the
case
as
a
whole,
they
were
not
imputed
to
this
petitioner.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
which
suggests
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
relation
to
this
petition,
there
aren’t
very
many
to
co-conspirators
to
declarations
that
have
any
significance.
aside
from
the
murder,
the
proof
was
like
this.
juan
leeman
testified,
he
was
named
originally
as
a
defendant,
testified
that
in
april,
he
and
etheridge
decided.
they‘ve
been
in
robbing
merchandise
before.
they
cited
that
wasn’t
any
good
because
you
can
get
caught
with
the
merchandise
money
was
safer,
that
they
were
going
to
the
bank
robberies,
but
they
weren’t
going
to
do
it
themselves,
they
would
get
people
to
do
it
for
them.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
as
to
bostic,
i
don’t
think
so.
i
do
not
think
so.
on
that,
let
me
say,
that
i
think
a
question
of
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
i
think
in
relation
to
bostic,
i
think
the
question
of
withdrawal
from
the
conspiracy
your
honor
is
a
question
of
fact.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
it’s
not
only
that
he
was
in
jail
because
for
example
beard
was
in
jail
for
a
few
days
and
let
out
on
bail.
beard
was
arrested
when
--
bostic
was
taken
because
bostic
was
found
in
his
house.
now,
beard
was
arrested
at
that
point
and
then
was
out
on
bail
and
it
was
after
he
was
out
on
bail
that
they
committed
the
third
robbery
and
that
they
committed
the
murder.
but
the
question
as
to
bostic
is
a
question
of
withdrawal
and
that’s
a
question
of
fact
and
on
these
facts,
i
think
there
really
isn’t
any
doubt
that
he
had
very
nearly
been
withdrawn
from
the
conspiracy,
removed,
i
don’t
know
if
it
was
a
voluntary
withdrawal,
but
he
had
withdrawn.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes.
that’s
--
that
quotation
on
page
12
and
13
of
our
brief.
it’s
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
there
wasn’t
any
instruction
specifically
on
it.
there
was
an
instruction
which
is
that
somebody
could
withdraw
and
there
wasn’t
any
instruction
on
the
consequences
of
withdrawal,
although
i
think
it
is
evident
that
the
person
in
that
is
if
he
had
withdrawn,
he
wouldn’t
be
held.
but
what
the
judge
did
say
and
what
the
theory
of
this
case
is
was
that
bostic
had
been
shown
to
be
a
member
of
the
conspiracy
to
rob
banks
on
plenty
of
evidence
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
murder.
plenty
of
evidence
of
what
he
did
and
what
he
and
self
said
to
his
girlfriend
in
court
long
before
he
was
apprehended.
this
first
robbery
occurred
in
april
and
then
they
went
down
to
florida,
a
group
of
them.
at
this
point,
beard
comes
into
the
picture.
apparently
he’s
a
friend
of
fergusons
and
then
a
whole
group
of
them
go
up
and
try
to
rob
a
bank
in
orlinda,
that’s
includes
this
petitioner,
at
orlinda,
tennessee,
but
that
bank
robbery
was
unsuccessful
because
an
employee
the
bank
lived
above
it,
heard
the
noise.
and
then
they
come
back
and
in
june,
petitioner
is
arrested.
now
at
that
point
he’s
out.
there’s
no
question
i
think
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case
and
i
think
there
isn’t
any
question
the
jury
so
understood.
it
happened
to
be
as
highly
selective
jury
in
its
verdict
even
as
to
the
others.
and
for
example
is,
in
august
bank
robbery
where
he
was
charged
but
the
jury
wasn’t
satisfied
with
the
proof
as
to
that
robbery
so
the
only
person
who
was
convicted
in
relation
to
that
conspiracy
was
beard
who
was
shown
to
have
had
the
money
from
the
robbery
in
his
actual
possession.
and
while
the
judge
did
not
specifically
charge
that
the
murder
was
not
to
be
considered
in
relation
to
petitioner,
he
did
charge
in
relation
to
statements
as
to
others
that
as
--
and
that’s
at
556
of
the
record.
the
statements,
testimonies
been
offered
relating
to
statements
made
by
one
or
more
of
the
defendants
on
one
or
more
occasions.
testimony
being
of
the
witness
is
leeman
who
test
--
who
was
a
member
of
the
conspiracy
and
testified
to
acts
either
that
he
knew
about
the
planning
or
that
had
been
told
to
him
right
after
the
robbery.
connie,
who
relates
only
to
statements
by
beard
from
and
that’s
petitioners
girlfriend
and
letos
who
was
with
the
group
in
florida
and
testified
to
statements
they
made
there.
so
that
we
do
not
have
as
to
this
petitioner
the
basic
rules
going
into
questions
of
proving
his
part
in
the
conspiracy
for
the
time
he
was
in
it
by
statements
of
co-conspirators.
the
major
part
of
the
proof
against
him
came
from
his
co-conspirator
leeman
and
his
own
personal
admissions
to
his
friends.
now,
there
was
some
other
co-conspirators
statements
admitted.
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
when
there
was
an
attempt
to
prove
some
of
the
statements
that
ferguson
had
made
to
some
of
the
girls,
at
that
point,
page
148
of
the
record,
counsel
have
checked
it
and
that
didn't
come
in
in
that
way.
some
other
statements
by
ferguson
came
in
at
another
time.
other
complaints
that
are
made
by
petitioner
about
hearsay
evidence
don’t
mention
him
at
all.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
main
complaint
is
in
relation
to
testimony
regarding
a
young
man
himself
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
petitioner,
so
that
this
case
really
does
not
involve
the
grunewald
question
or
the
co-conspirator
rule.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no
and
our
brief
in
opposition
as
a
matter
of
fact.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
can
only
say
your
honor,
you
have
to
read
the
record
in
regard
to
bostic.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
that’s
right,
i
think,
as
i
say,
there
is
a
combination
of
things
the
--
we
didn’t
concentrate
on
bostic
and
i’m
afraid
the
court
of
appeals
didn’t
either
and
particularly
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
about
bostic
is
not
sustainable
in
my
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
i
think
that
the
question
is
whether
bostic’s
conviction
is
sustainable?
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
right.
i
think
that
the
judgment
is
clearly
sustainable.
the
opinion
is
not.
on
these
facts,
i
don’t
say
that
there
weren’t
other
facts
where
somebody
in
jail
might
be
held
to
be
a
member
of
the
conspiracy.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
on
these
facts,
no.
the
opinion
is
not
sustainable.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
we
do
know
that
the
jury
found
other
overt
acts.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
no
they
were
not
special
verdicts,
but
they
were
counts
of
the
indictment
which
charged
this
first
bank
robbery
which
petitioner
was
in
and
charged
receiving
the
money
from
that
bank
robbery
which
was
split
five
ways.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
i
don’t
think
we
do
because
it’s
perfectly
clear
that
the
jury
found
on
ample,
more
than
ample
evidence
that
petitioner
committed
this
bordeaux
bank
robbery.
now,
he
was
charged
with
being
a
member
of
the
conspiracy
which
to
rob
banks.
the
judge
by
the
way
specifically
refused
to
charge
on
pinkerton
in
this
case.
he
said,
in
doing
that,
he
said,
the
murder
in
this
case
is
not
charged
as
an
object
of
the
conspiracy,
it’s
charged
as
one
of
the
overt
acts.
in
the
face
of
the
fact
that
the
jury
clearly
found
that
these
people
were
in
a
conspiracy,
they
commit
the
bordeaux
robbery
and
something
else
they
didn’t
a
specific
of
finding
about
the
bank
robberies
but
they
clearly
found
that
because
those
were
substantive
of
events
charged
to
jury
as
to
those
substantive
offense
since
you
can’t
consider
co-conspiracy
statements.
he
went
beyond
what
he
was
required
to
do,
but
he
did
so
charge
and
as
i
say
the
evidence
is
overwhelming
that
they
did
do
this
bank
robbery.
then
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
the
jury
found
the
conspiracy
to
rob
banks
and
at
least
the
overt
act
of
the
bordeaux
robbery
whether
in
addition
it
also
found
the
murder
would
be
unimportant.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
i
think
that
that
is
and
i
think
that
is
very
clear.
i
also
think
that
if
you
go
through
the
record
which
you
can’t
do
when
you
start
just
putting
together
all
the
objections
in
the
appendix
and
now
it
goes
around
them,
i
think
if
one
goes
through
the
record,
one
can
see
that
the
government
really
did
try
to
keep
the
event
compartmentalized.
they
said
clearly
in
the
beginning,
were
going
to
present
the
evidence
of
the
murder
first
and
the
murder
concerns
beard
and
etheridge,
those
only
--
those
two.
then
later
on
when
there’s
some
attempt
by
beard
to
imply
that
self
which
again
a
young
man
who
wasn’t,
didn’t
even
come
up
on
appeal
might
have
tried
to
murder
him.
they
said,
“well,
he
wasn’t
even
charged
with
the
murder.
it
was
made
clear
to
us
at
trial
that
while
it
was
an
overt
act
in
doings
of
the
conspiracy
with
etheridge
as
the
center
of
the
conspiracy,
that
don’t
come
through
the
trial
also.
it
was
perfectly
clear
throughout
the
trial
that
nobody
was
saying
that
not
only
bostic,
but
self
and
some
of
the
other
defendants,
nobody
was
accusing
anybody
but
beard
and
etheridge
as
being
responsible
for
the
murder
and
with
etheridge
the
real
center
of
the
conspiracy.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes.
that
is
our
position
because
our
position
is
that
it
is
perfectly
clear
on
this
record
in
every
way
that
bostic
was
not
charged
directly
or
by
implication
with
the
murder.
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
perfectly
clear
on
this
record
that
bostic
was
properly
convicted
both
of
the
bordeaux
bank
robbery
with
which
he
was
charged
and
winged
with
being
a
member
of
the
conspiracy
for
the
length
of
time
that
he
was
out
of
jail.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it’s
significant
that
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
i
think
in
his
brief
he
says
the
question
is,
whether
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
charged
him
as
being
responsible
for
the
murder.
and
although
the
court
of
appeals
really
says
is,
that
it
wasn’t
--
there
was
no
showing
of
affirmative
withdrawal
from
the
conspiracy,
i
don’t
think,
they
said
he
did
it
or
really
had
any
part
in
it
and
they
just
said
technically,
legally
he
had
withdrawn.
i
think
that
was
wrong
because
i
think
that
on
these
facts
would
show,
he
was
taken
over
the
penitentiary
and
there’s
absolutely
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
anybody
even
visited
him
after
that.
i
think
it
would
be
wrong
to
impute
the
murder
to
him,
but
i
don’t
think
it
was
done
at
the
trial.
i
think
it
was
made
perfectly
clear
that
he
wasn’t
involved.
