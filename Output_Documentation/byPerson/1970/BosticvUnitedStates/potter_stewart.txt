justice
potter
stewart
i
just
have
one
or
two
questions.
turning
to
the
opinion
of
judge
edwards
in
the
sixth
circuit,
there’s
a
paragraph
there
that
says,
as
to
bostic,
although
he
had
been
returned
to
the
penitentiary
sometime
before
ferguson’s
murder,
there
is
no
evidence
that
he
had
renounced
or
withdrawn
from
the
conspiracy.
you
may
remember
that.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
is
now
my
understanding
in
the
light
of
this
record
that
the
government
never
claimed
that
he
continue
to
be
a
member
of
the
conspiracy
after
his
arrest
and
return
to
prison
and
i’m
referring
to
the
part
of
the
record
that
appears
on
page
12
and
13
of
the
government’s
brief
which
shows
that
the
prosecutor
made
clear
that
in
june,
mr.
bostic
leaves
the
conspiracy
because
he’s
arrested
and
sentenced
and
sent
to
the
penitentiary.
so
at
that
point,
of
course,
bostic
is
no
longer
a
party
to
the
conspiracy,
that’s
all.
i
gather
from
the
things
i’ve
just
read
you
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
at
least
in
that
respect
misapprehended
what
the
--
what
the
government’s
claim
was,
didn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
was
the
--
that
was
the
overall
conspiracy
hatched
up
by
etheridge.
in
the
opposition
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
case,
the
government
stated
as
a
fact
that
there
had
been
a
charge
here
of
conspiracy
to
commit
murder
and
there
was
no
such
charge
in
the
indictment,
was
there?
i’m
not
being
critical
of
you.
i’m
saying
that
was
a
misstatement,
i
gather,
in
the
government’s
opposition.
justice
potter
stewart
and
bostic
was
not
charged
with
murder
or
with
conspiracy
to
commit
murder,
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
because
the
fact
is
that
as
was
made
clear,
he
was
in
prison
for
about
three
months
before
the
murder
was
committed
and
on
the
day
the
murder
was
committed.
