mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
thomas
c.
binkley.
i’m
a
member
of
the
firm
of
howser,
thomas,
summers
&
binkley
and
my
co-counsel
is
mr.
philip
carden
from
nashville.
this
--
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
was
tried
in
the
federal
district
court
in
nashville
where
he
was
charged
in
three
counts
of
an
eight-count
indictment.
specifically,
he
was
charged
with
conspiracy
or
being
a
part
of
a
conspiracy
to
rob
banks.
he
was
charged
with
the
robbing
of
a
bank
and
he
was
charged
with
receiving
money
from
the
robbery
of
this
bank.
this
trial
took
some
29
days,
not
of
actual
trial
time
but
29
days
to
trial.
the
petitioner
herein
was
apprehended
at
the
time
this
trial
took
place,
he
had
been
apprehended
and
returned
to
the
penitentiary
on
the
5th
day
of
june.
the
bank
robbery,
he
was
alleged
to
have
been
involved
in,
occurred
on
the
24th
day
of
april.
there
were
other
charges
--
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
it
was
pointed
out
at
the
trial
or
it
was
argued
by
counsel
for
the
government
at
the
trial
that
they
were
going
to
show
that
his
escape
was
a
part
of
the
conspiracy,
but
this
was
never
shown.
this
is
important
for
the
court
because
there
were
other
charges
made.
in
this
eight-count
indictment
there
was
a
charge
of
a
bank
robbery
which
occurred
on
august
the
3rd
which
was
some
two
months
after
the
petitioner
was
put
back
in
jail
and
then
there
was
also
a
charge
of
murder
as
a
violation
of
federal
statute
to
conceal
crimes
previously
committed.
all
of
this
occurred
after
the
petitioner
was
returned
to
the
penitentiary.
now,
our
primary
contentions
before
the
court,
our
first
proposition;
we’re
saying
that
the
recent
rulings
of
the
court
have
changed
or
should
change
the
conspiracy
exception
to
the
hearsay
rule.
we
think
this
is
specifically,
i
mean,
especially
true
in
view
of
the
bruton
decision,
in
view
of
the
jackson
versus
denno
case
decided
before
bruton
and
it’s
our
contention
that
bruton
draws
these
cases
together.
as
the
court
will
recall
in
the
jackson
case,
it
was
concerned
with
the
confession
which
was
turned
over
to
the
jury
under
the
new
york
rule
which
provided
that
the
jury
should
determine
whether
the
confession
is
voluntary
or
not.
we
think
even
though
it
hasn’t
been
expanded
at
this
point
to
cover
cases
involving
conspiracy,
it’s
our
contention
that
it
should
follow.
in
the
court,
in
the
case
--
in
the
court
below,
the
district
judge
allowed
proof
to
be
offered
and
determined
that
the
jury
should
determine
whether
or
not
a
conspiracy
in
fact
existed,
whether
or
not
out
of
court
statements
made
by
a
declarant,
who
was
a
part
of
the
--
one
of
the
declarants
making
out
of
court
statements
was
a
part
of
the
conspiracy,
whether
the
statements
were
made
in
the
course
of
the
conspiracy
and
whether
it
was
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy.
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
did
away
with
what
if
your
honor
--
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
no
sir.
we’re
--
it’s
our
contention
that
the
rationale
of
bruton
and
the
cases
preceding
bruton,
jackson
versus
denno
and
others
which
are
mentioned
in
bruton
that
the
logical
consequence
is
to
do
away
with
the
conspiracy
exception
rule
as
it
is
now
employed
by
the
federal
courts.
we
can
see
little
difference
in
allowing,
in
saying
that
it’s
a
violation
of
constitutional
rights
to
allow
a
jury
to
determine
the
voluntariness
of
a
confession
and
then
on
the
other
hand
say
that
it
wouldn’t
be
proper
or
that
it
would
be
proper
for
them
to
determine
whether
a
conspiracy
in
fact
existed.
and
we
submit
in
our
case,
in
the
present
case
before
the
court,
the
way
it
was
tried,
we
allowed
the
out
of
court
hearsay
statements
to
come
in.
we
allowed
the
prosecution
--
the
prosecution
of
course,
can
start
the
case
any
way
they
want
to,
the
prosecution
started
this
case
in
this
case
with
the
murder
count
and
then
the
jury
has
to
sift
through
13
days
of
testimony
and
determine
whether
or
not
this
conspiracy
in
fact
existed
before
they
can
start
determining,
before
they
can
weigh
the
testimony
and
we
submit
especially
in
the
framework
of
our
case,
that
it
was
difficult
for
the
trial
judge
to
keep
up
with
the
statements
without
requiring
the
jury
to
in
effect
determine
whether
the
conspiracy
existed
by
the
hearsay
statements
they
were
hearing.
and
we
feel
that
the
proper
rule,
the
rule
which
should
be
required
of
any
district
court
in
trying
this
would
be
first
to
determine
whether
the
conspiracy
exists
without
turning
this
over
to
the
jury
and
it
is
our
contention
that
the
rationale
of
the
bruton
case
would
require
this
route.
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
yes
sir.
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
now
would
be
--
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
i
think
now
would
be
the
perfect
time
to
change
it.
i
think
we
have
come
this
way
and
i
think
this
is
the
way
the
courts
are
leaning
and
as
was
stated
in
one
of
the
cases,
there’s
no
way
that
we
can
guarantee
a
defendant
perfect
trial.
we
have
to
guarantee
him
as
fairer
trial
as
we
can
and
certainly
you
obviate
some
of
the
difficulties
you
have
if
you
require
that
at
first
be
established
that
the
conspiracy
exists.
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
yes
sir.
but
this
is
the
problem
that
the
court
has
been
faced
with
in
the
jackson
case
and
others
and
as
was
stated
so
by
justice
jackson
in
the
krulewitch
case
that
you
just
can't
expect
the
jury
to
be
able
to
sift
all
of
this
through
and
there
has
to
be
a
limitation
on
human
beings.
and
in
the
present
case
before
the
court
with
the
conglomeration
of
proof
that
was
offered,
we
just
feel
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
jury
to
determine
this.
our
second
proposition
is
concerned
with
the
fact
that
we
are
stating
that
the
petitioner
herein
was
deprived
of
a
fair
trial
by
or
was
prejudiced
by
not
having
a
severance.
his
case
was
different
from
the
other
defendants
involved
in
that
he
was
incarcerated
at
a
time
the
alleged
murder
was
committed,
at
the
time
the
second
bank
robbery
was
committed
and
could
have
had
no
part
in
this,
at
least,
it
would
have
to
be
affirmatively
shown
that
he
had
a
part
in
it.
since
the
1966
amendment
to
rule
14,
it’s
up
to
the
district
judge
if
he
sees
there’s
going
to
be
some
prejudice
involved
to
sever
the
cases.
this
can
be
done
even
without
motion.
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
may
it
please,
your
honor,
he
was
incarcerated
on
june
the
5th.
he
wasn’t
incarcerated
at
time
of
the
first
bank
robbery
took
place
which
was
april
of
24th
1967,
but
there
was
a
second
substantive
charge
of
a
bank
robbery
which
took
place
on
august
the
3rd
and
he
was
incarcerated
at
that
time.
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
well
--
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i
haven’t
been
able
to
find
a
quote
from
this
court
directly
on
this
that
the
court
of
appeals
have
held
in
two
cases
cited
in
our
brief
that
once
a
conspirator
is
arrested
at
least
as
far
the
conspiracy
is
concerned,
his
part
in
the
conspiracy
is
terminated.
now
certainly
a
person
in
jail,
i’m
sure,
could
take
part
in
a
conspiracy,
but
i
think
at
the
time
he’s
arrested,
there
would
be
a
presumption
that
his
part
has
ended
then
it
would
be
on
the
government
to
affirmatively
show
that
his
part
continued.
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
well,
as
far
as
proving
the
conspiracy,
this
doesn’t
add.
as
far
as
proving
the
continuing
part
of
the
conspiracy,
this
is
just
a
rule
of
evidence,
if
your
honor
please,
of
the
burden
of
going
followed
with
the
proof.
certainly
the
government
can
show
that
he
was
a
part
of
the
conspiracy
and
if
the
government
can
prove
that
he
was
a
part
of
it
up
to
a
point
and
they
prove
this
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
certainly
he
can
be
convicted
of
conspiracy.
the
complaint
the
petitioner
makes
about
the
matters
that
took
place
after
he
was
arrested
is
that
this
not
only
affected
the
conspiracy
account,
it
affected
the
substantive
count
and
put
him
on
a
position
where
as
we
argue
in
the
case.
there
were
only
two
witnesses
against
him
and
witnesses
we
say
were
of
questionable
character,
but
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
in
this
case,
put
the
petitioner
in
such
a
position
that
it’s
our
contention
the
jury
couldn’t
weigh
the
testimony
of
these
two
witnesses
against
him.
and
we
feel
this
could
all
have
been
taken
care
of
by
a
severance
and
the
severance
was
asked
for
initially.
for
example,
as
we
point
out,
the
case
was
started
by
the
prosecution
putting
on
evidence
of
a
murder
that
took
place.
there
was
four
days
of
testimony
concerning
this
murder
which
the
petitioner
had
no
part
in
whatever.
and
then
we
had
testimony
concerning
this
other
bank
robbery,
there
was
testimony
in
the
record
and
the
government
sought
to
put
in
testimony
where
witnesses
had
been
intimidated
and
certainly
this
was
something
that
by
the
allegations
had
to
happen
after
the
petitioner
had
been
incarcerated.
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
no.
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
no
sir.
there
were
--
there
were
objections
made
all
during
the
trial
concerning
this,
but
to
my
best
recollection,
we
didn’t
ask
for
any
special
instructions.
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
well,
we
feel
that
it
possibly
would
and
quite
in
the
light
of
the
judges’
rulings
during
the
trial.
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
no
sir.
now,
if
your
honor,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
third
matter,
we
are
contending
is
concerned
with
whether
not
the
conspiracy
continued
and
as
far
as
the
petitioner
was
concerned
after
he
was
arrested.
and
there
apparently
the
government
is
not
contesting
this
particular
part
of
it
and
as
we’ve
stated
--
as
we’ve
stated
before
our
primary
contention
here
is
even
if
we
have
had
limiting
instructions
with
the
mass
of
proof
that
went
in
this
case,
both
hearsay
and
non-hearsay
and
for
matters
unrelated
to
the
charges
against
the
petitioner
that
i
don’t
think
it’s
our
contention
there
is
no
way
the
jury
could
have
sifted
through
this
and
come
up
with
a
proper
decision.
and
there’s
no
way
with
the
instruction
from
the
court
that
the
jury
could
have
sifted
the
admissible
from
the
inadmissible
and
rendered
a
fair
verdict
at
least
as
far
as
this
petitioner
is
concerned.
if
the
court
has
no
other
questions
at
this
time,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
yes
sir,
i
remember
that.
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
apparently
so,
the
statement
made
by
judge
edwards’
is
clearly
in
conflict
with
other
court
of
appeals
decisions
and
this
is
the
only
statement
that
i
know
of
made
in
the
trial.
this
is
about
prosecutor
where
he
says
that
he
leaves
the
conspiracy
because
he
is
sent
to
the
penitentiary,
but
continuing
all
in
here
i
don’t
know
what
the
jury
thought
of
this
man
where
it
says,
“so
at
this
point
of
course,
his
no
longer
part
of
the
conspiracy,”
but
nonetheless,
this
would
not
prevent
this
from
being
of
single
continuing
conspiracy.
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
well,
there
was
a
charge,
a
substantive
charge
as
a
part
of
the
conspiracy
and
then
there
was
another
charge
of
committing
murder
to
avoid
apprehension
so
--
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
that’s
right.
of
course,
they're
charged
in
one
count
and
he
wasn’t
named
in
that
--
with
--
they
were
11
overt
acts
in
the
conspiracy
count
with
--
if
i
recall,
this
being,
the
murder
charge
being
the
11th
one.
he
wasn’t
named
specifically
in
that.
it’s
a
part
of
the
overt
acts
of
the
conspiracy
count
that
all
parties
in
the
trial
were
--
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
i
believe,
my
recollection
doesn’t
serve
me
well
on
that,
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
he
might
have.
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
well,
sir,
of
course.
he
didn’t
come
back
for
ten
days
and
this
jury
was
a
locked
up
for
29
days,
so
a
lot
transpired
but
i’m
sure
if
your
honor
recalls
that,
that
was
said.
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
nine
minutes,
yes
sir.
may
it
please
the
court.
there
has
been
some
confusion
on
this
and
i
think
at
least
for
our
argument
today,
we’ve
been
drawn
away
to
what
might
possibly
be
one
of
the
minor
issues
in
the
case.
but
to
answer
in
a
way,
the
record
will
show
the
parts
of
the
testimony
we’ve
cited
in
the
appendix
will
show,
that
the
prosecutor
wouldn’t
do
me
any
favor
and
the
petitioner
any
favor
when
he
conceded
that
the
petitioner
was
back
in
the
penitentiary
because
i’ve
tried
in
most
to
the
case
keep
that
out.
and
so
i
didn’t
feel
like
i
could
elaborate
on
this
man’s
incarceration
because
it
certainly
doesn’t
help
you
before
a
jury
to
let
you
know
that
your
client's
from
that
place
of
residence
at
this
time
is
a
state
penitentiary.
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
yes
sir.
i
believe
that,
i’m
sure
that
did
help
him
if
in
fact
this
was
done.
the
count
was
still
tied
on
to
the
conspiracy
charge
and
it’s
just
a
question
of
whether
the
jury
can
remove
this
from
their
minds
and
take
it
away,
especially
in
view
of
everything
else
that
came
in.
now,
there
was
a
testimony.
it’s
pointed
out
in
our
brief
and
we’ve
cited
examples
in
the
appendix
of
portions
where
the
government
impeached
their
own
witnesses
with
prior
statements
not
made
by
the
person,
but
alleged
to
have
been
made
by
the
fbi
man
where
the
statement
of
what
the
fbi
man
said
the
witness
said
was
read
in
open
court
to
impeach.
there
was
also
some
testimony
of
declarations
made
by
ferguson,
who
of
course
was
dead
and
who
we
had
no
way
to
cross
examine.
there
was
also
an
fbi
report
brought
in
by
--
when
beard
was
being
testified,
of
course,
this
takes
beard
a
little
out
of
the
rationale
of
the
bruton
case,
but
we
submit
that
we’ve
pointed
out
instances
where
this
has
happened.
now,
there
was
a
discussion
in
court
when
ferguson’s
brother
was
testifying
and
they
were
trying
to
allow
this
to
come
in
by
asking
ferguson’s
brother
first,
if
he
knew
any
of
the
parties
and
then
saying,
“now,
don’t
name
the
parties
but
go
ahead
and
tell
us
what
was
said”
and
of
course
that
was
objected
to,
but
that
was
allowed
to
come
in.
it’s
our
contention
that
it
should
be
spelled
out
that
now
is
the
appropriate
time,
the
rationale
of
the
bruton
case,
taking
into
account
the
jackson
case
and
others
should
set
down
the
rule
that
the
government,
just
like
in
a
--
question
of
volunteer
confession,
the
trial
judge
should
first
determine
there
is
a
conspiracy
before
he
allows
all
of
this
hearsay
to
come
in
and
then
ask
the
jury
after
you’ve
heard
all
this,
determine
whether
conspiracy
existed.
a
conspiracy
case
is
a
difficult
case
to
try.
the
record
shows
that
every
piece
of
hearsay
and
double
hearsay
was
brought
into
this
record
by
the
prosecutor
standing
up
and
saying,
but
your
honor,
this
is
a
conspiracy
case
which
means
everything
goes.
this
--
it’s
our
contention
that
now
is
the
time
and
certainly
if
the
court
doesn’t
feel
that
this
should
be
reversed
on
--
under
the
bruton
rule,
certainly
it
was
prejudicial
and
prejudice
could
have
been
taken
away
by
severance.
and
certainly
with
the
obstacles,
the
difficulties
the
court
of
appeals
found
in
this
that
the
judge,
the
trial
judge
found,
certainly
it
should
have
been
known
that
we
could
have
avoided
any
of
this
by
having
a
separate
trial
and
we’ll
never
know.
of
course,
we
concede
the
jury
convicted,
but
we’ll
never
know,
how
they
would
have
weighed
the
testimony
of
the
two
witnesses
against
the
petitioner
herein
had
their
minds
not
been
cluttered
with
all
these
other
things
that
i
couldn’t
remove
from
the
jury
just
as
i
couldn’t
remove
myself
from
the
counsel
table
where
we
were
required
to
be
by
the
court.
and
it’s
our
contention
that
this
case
should
be
reversed
and
remanded
on
our
two
grounds.
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
thomas
c.
binkley.
i’m
a
member
of
the
firm
of
howser,
thomas,
summers
&
binkley
and
my
co-counsel
is
mr.
philip
carden
from
nashville.
this
--
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
was
tried
in
the
federal
district
court
in
nashville
where
he
was
charged
in
three
counts
of
an
eight-count
indictment.
specifically,
he
was
charged
with
conspiracy
or
being
a
part
of
a
conspiracy
to
rob
banks.
he
was
charged
with
the
robbing
of
a
bank
and
he
was
charged
with
receiving
money
from
the
robbery
of
this
bank.
this
trial
took
some
29
days,
not
of
actual
trial
time
but
29
days
to
trial.
the
petitioner
herein
was
apprehended
at
the
time
this
trial
took
place,
he
had
been
apprehended
and
returned
to
the
penitentiary
on
the
5th
day
of
june.
the
bank
robbery,
he
was
alleged
to
have
been
involved
in,
occurred
on
the
24th
day
of
april.
there
were
other
charges
--
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
it
was
pointed
out
at
the
trial
or
it
was
argued
by
counsel
for
the
government
at
the
trial
that
they
were
going
to
show
that
his
escape
was
a
part
of
the
conspiracy,
but
this
was
never
shown.
this
is
important
for
the
court
because
there
were
other
charges
made.
in
this
eight-count
indictment
there
was
a
charge
of
a
bank
robbery
which
occurred
on
august
the
3rd
which
was
some
two
months
after
the
petitioner
was
put
back
in
jail
and
then
there
was
also
a
charge
of
murder
as
a
violation
of
federal
statute
to
conceal
crimes
previously
committed.
all
of
this
occurred
after
the
petitioner
was
returned
to
the
penitentiary.
now,
our
primary
contentions
before
the
court,
our
first
proposition;
we’re
saying
that
the
recent
rulings
of
the
court
have
changed
or
should
change
the
conspiracy
exception
to
the
hearsay
rule.
we
think
this
is
specifically,
i
mean,
especially
true
in
view
of
the
bruton
decision,
in
view
of
the
jackson
versus
denno
case
decided
before
bruton
and
it’s
our
contention
that
bruton
draws
these
cases
together.
as
the
court
will
recall
in
the
jackson
case,
it
was
concerned
with
the
confession
which
was
turned
over
to
the
jury
under
the
new
york
rule
which
provided
that
the
jury
should
determine
whether
the
confession
is
voluntary
or
not.
we
think
even
though
it
hasn’t
been
expanded
at
this
point
to
cover
cases
involving
conspiracy,
it’s
our
contention
that
it
should
follow.
in
the
court,
in
the
case
--
in
the
court
below,
the
district
judge
allowed
proof
to
be
offered
and
determined
that
the
jury
should
determine
whether
or
not
a
conspiracy
in
fact
existed,
whether
or
not
out
of
court
statements
made
by
a
declarant,
who
was
a
part
of
the
--
one
of
the
declarants
making
out
of
court
statements
was
a
part
of
the
conspiracy,
whether
the
statements
were
made
in
the
course
of
the
conspiracy
and
whether
it
was
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy.
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
did
away
with
what
if
your
honor
--
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
no
sir.
we’re
--
it’s
our
contention
that
the
rationale
of
bruton
and
the
cases
preceding
bruton,
jackson
versus
denno
and
others
which
are
mentioned
in
bruton
that
the
logical
consequence
is
to
do
away
with
the
conspiracy
exception
rule
as
it
is
now
employed
by
the
federal
courts.
we
can
see
little
difference
in
allowing,
in
saying
that
it’s
a
violation
of
constitutional
rights
to
allow
a
jury
to
determine
the
voluntariness
of
a
confession
and
then
on
the
other
hand
say
that
it
wouldn’t
be
proper
or
that
it
would
be
proper
for
them
to
determine
whether
a
conspiracy
in
fact
existed.
and
we
submit
in
our
case,
in
the
present
case
before
the
court,
the
way
it
was
tried,
we
allowed
the
out
of
court
hearsay
statements
to
come
in.
we
allowed
the
prosecution
--
the
prosecution
of
course,
can
start
the
case
any
way
they
want
to,
the
prosecution
started
this
case
in
this
case
with
the
murder
count
and
then
the
jury
has
to
sift
through
13
days
of
testimony
and
determine
whether
or
not
this
conspiracy
in
fact
existed
before
they
can
start
determining,
before
they
can
weigh
the
testimony
and
we
submit
especially
in
the
framework
of
our
case,
that
it
was
difficult
for
the
trial
judge
to
keep
up
with
the
statements
without
requiring
the
jury
to
in
effect
determine
whether
the
conspiracy
existed
by
the
hearsay
statements
they
were
hearing.
and
we
feel
that
the
proper
rule,
the
rule
which
should
be
required
of
any
district
court
in
trying
this
would
be
first
to
determine
whether
the
conspiracy
exists
without
turning
this
over
to
the
jury
and
it
is
our
contention
that
the
rationale
of
the
bruton
case
would
require
this
route.
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
yes
sir.
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
now
would
be
--
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
i
think
now
would
be
the
perfect
time
to
change
it.
i
think
we
have
come
this
way
and
i
think
this
is
the
way
the
courts
are
leaning
and
as
was
stated
in
one
of
the
cases,
there’s
no
way
that
we
can
guarantee
a
defendant
perfect
trial.
we
have
to
guarantee
him
as
fairer
trial
as
we
can
and
certainly
you
obviate
some
of
the
difficulties
you
have
if
you
require
that
at
first
be
established
that
the
conspiracy
exists.
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
yes
sir.
but
this
is
the
problem
that
the
court
has
been
faced
with
in
the
jackson
case
and
others
and
as
was
stated
so
by
justice
jackson
in
the
krulewitch
case
that
you
just
can't
expect
the
jury
to
be
able
to
sift
all
of
this
through
and
there
has
to
be
a
limitation
on
human
beings.
and
in
the
present
case
before
the
court
with
the
conglomeration
of
proof
that
was
offered,
we
just
feel
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
jury
to
determine
this.
our
second
proposition
is
concerned
with
the
fact
that
we
are
stating
that
the
petitioner
herein
was
deprived
of
a
fair
trial
by
or
was
prejudiced
by
not
having
a
severance.
his
case
was
different
from
the
other
defendants
involved
in
that
he
was
incarcerated
at
a
time
the
alleged
murder
was
committed,
at
the
time
the
second
bank
robbery
was
committed
and
could
have
had
no
part
in
this,
at
least,
it
would
have
to
be
affirmatively
shown
that
he
had
a
part
in
it.
since
the
1966
amendment
to
rule
14,
it’s
up
to
the
district
judge
if
he
sees
there’s
going
to
be
some
prejudice
involved
to
sever
the
cases.
this
can
be
done
even
without
motion.
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
may
it
please,
your
honor,
he
was
incarcerated
on
june
the
5th.
he
wasn’t
incarcerated
at
time
of
the
first
bank
robbery
took
place
which
was
april
of
24th
1967,
but
there
was
a
second
substantive
charge
of
a
bank
robbery
which
took
place
on
august
the
3rd
and
he
was
incarcerated
at
that
time.
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
well
--
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i
haven’t
been
able
to
find
a
quote
from
this
court
directly
on
this
that
the
court
of
appeals
have
held
in
two
cases
cited
in
our
brief
that
once
a
conspirator
is
arrested
at
least
as
far
the
conspiracy
is
concerned,
his
part
in
the
conspiracy
is
terminated.
now
certainly
a
person
in
jail,
i’m
sure,
could
take
part
in
a
conspiracy,
but
i
think
at
the
time
he’s
arrested,
there
would
be
a
presumption
that
his
part
has
ended
then
it
would
be
on
the
government
to
affirmatively
show
that
his
part
continued.
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
well,
as
far
as
proving
the
conspiracy,
this
doesn’t
add.
as
far
as
proving
the
continuing
part
of
the
conspiracy,
this
is
just
a
rule
of
evidence,
if
your
honor
please,
of
the
burden
of
going
followed
with
the
proof.
certainly
the
government
can
show
that
he
was
a
part
of
the
conspiracy
and
if
the
government
can
prove
that
he
was
a
part
of
it
up
to
a
point
and
they
prove
this
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
certainly
he
can
be
convicted
of
conspiracy.
the
complaint
the
petitioner
makes
about
the
matters
that
took
place
after
he
was
arrested
is
that
this
not
only
affected
the
conspiracy
account,
it
affected
the
substantive
count
and
put
him
on
a
position
where
as
we
argue
in
the
case.
there
were
only
two
witnesses
against
him
and
witnesses
we
say
were
of
questionable
character,
but
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
in
this
case,
put
the
petitioner
in
such
a
position
that
it’s
our
contention
the
jury
couldn’t
weigh
the
testimony
of
these
two
witnesses
against
him.
and
we
feel
this
could
all
have
been
taken
care
of
by
a
severance
and
the
severance
was
asked
for
initially.
for
example,
as
we
point
out,
the
case
was
started
by
the
prosecution
putting
on
evidence
of
a
murder
that
took
place.
there
was
four
days
of
testimony
concerning
this
murder
which
the
petitioner
had
no
part
in
whatever.
and
then
we
had
testimony
concerning
this
other
bank
robbery,
there
was
testimony
in
the
record
and
the
government
sought
to
put
in
testimony
where
witnesses
had
been
intimidated
and
certainly
this
was
something
that
by
the
allegations
had
to
happen
after
the
petitioner
had
been
incarcerated.
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
no.
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
no
sir.
there
were
--
there
were
objections
made
all
during
the
trial
concerning
this,
but
to
my
best
recollection,
we
didn’t
ask
for
any
special
instructions.
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
well,
we
feel
that
it
possibly
would
and
quite
in
the
light
of
the
judges’
rulings
during
the
trial.
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
no
sir.
now,
if
your
honor,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
third
matter,
we
are
contending
is
concerned
with
whether
not
the
conspiracy
continued
and
as
far
as
the
petitioner
was
concerned
after
he
was
arrested.
and
there
apparently
the
government
is
not
contesting
this
particular
part
of
it
and
as
we’ve
stated
--
as
we’ve
stated
before
our
primary
contention
here
is
even
if
we
have
had
limiting
instructions
with
the
mass
of
proof
that
went
in
this
case,
both
hearsay
and
non-hearsay
and
for
matters
unrelated
to
the
charges
against
the
petitioner
that
i
don’t
think
it’s
our
contention
there
is
no
way
the
jury
could
have
sifted
through
this
and
come
up
with
a
proper
decision.
and
there’s
no
way
with
the
instruction
from
the
court
that
the
jury
could
have
sifted
the
admissible
from
the
inadmissible
and
rendered
a
fair
verdict
at
least
as
far
as
this
petitioner
is
concerned.
if
the
court
has
no
other
questions
at
this
time,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
yes
sir,
i
remember
that.
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
apparently
so,
the
statement
made
by
judge
edwards’
is
clearly
in
conflict
with
other
court
of
appeals
decisions
and
this
is
the
only
statement
that
i
know
of
made
in
the
trial.
this
is
about
prosecutor
where
he
says
that
he
leaves
the
conspiracy
because
he
is
sent
to
the
penitentiary,
but
continuing
all
in
here
i
don’t
know
what
the
jury
thought
of
this
man
where
it
says,
“so
at
this
point
of
course,
his
no
longer
part
of
the
conspiracy,”
but
nonetheless,
this
would
not
prevent
this
from
being
of
single
continuing
conspiracy.
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
well,
there
was
a
charge,
a
substantive
charge
as
a
part
of
the
conspiracy
and
then
there
was
another
charge
of
committing
murder
to
avoid
apprehension
so
--
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
that’s
right.
of
course,
they're
charged
in
one
count
and
he
wasn’t
named
in
that
--
with
--
they
were
11
overt
acts
in
the
conspiracy
count
with
--
if
i
recall,
this
being,
the
murder
charge
being
the
11th
one.
he
wasn’t
named
specifically
in
that.
it’s
a
part
of
the
overt
acts
of
the
conspiracy
count
that
all
parties
in
the
trial
were
--
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
i
believe,
my
recollection
doesn’t
serve
me
well
on
that,
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
he
might
have.
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
well,
sir,
of
course.
he
didn’t
come
back
for
ten
days
and
this
jury
was
a
locked
up
for
29
days,
so
a
lot
transpired
but
i’m
sure
if
your
honor
recalls
that,
that
was
said.
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
nine
minutes,
yes
sir.
may
it
please
the
court.
there
has
been
some
confusion
on
this
and
i
think
at
least
for
our
argument
today,
we’ve
been
drawn
away
to
what
might
possibly
be
one
of
the
minor
issues
in
the
case.
but
to
answer
in
a
way,
the
record
will
show
the
parts
of
the
testimony
we’ve
cited
in
the
appendix
will
show,
that
the
prosecutor
wouldn’t
do
me
any
favor
and
the
petitioner
any
favor
when
he
conceded
that
the
petitioner
was
back
in
the
penitentiary
because
i’ve
tried
in
most
to
the
case
keep
that
out.
and
so
i
didn’t
feel
like
i
could
elaborate
on
this
man’s
incarceration
because
it
certainly
doesn’t
help
you
before
a
jury
to
let
you
know
that
your
client's
from
that
place
of
residence
at
this
time
is
a
state
penitentiary.
mr.
thomas
c.
binkley
yes
sir.
i
believe
that,
i’m
sure
that
did
help
him
if
in
fact
this
was
done.
the
count
was
still
tied
on
to
the
conspiracy
charge
and
it’s
just
a
question
of
whether
the
jury
can
remove
this
from
their
minds
and
take
it
away,
especially
in
view
of
everything
else
that
came
in.
now,
there
was
a
testimony.
it’s
pointed
out
in
our
brief
and
we’ve
cited
examples
in
the
appendix
of
portions
where
the
government
impeached
their
own
witnesses
with
prior
statements
not
made
by
the
person,
but
alleged
to
have
been
made
by
the
fbi
man
where
the
statement
of
what
the
fbi
man
said
the
witness
said
was
read
in
open
court
to
impeach.
there
was
also
some
testimony
of
declarations
made
by
ferguson,
who
of
course
was
dead
and
who
we
had
no
way
to
cross
examine.
there
was
also
an
fbi
report
brought
in
by
--
when
beard
was
being
testified,
of
course,
this
takes
beard
a
little
out
of
the
rationale
of
the
bruton
case,
but
we
submit
that
we’ve
pointed
out
instances
where
this
has
happened.
now,
there
was
a
discussion
in
court
when
ferguson’s
brother
was
testifying
and
they
were
trying
to
allow
this
to
come
in
by
asking
ferguson’s
brother
first,
if
he
knew
any
of
the
parties
and
then
saying,
“now,
don’t
name
the
parties
but
go
ahead
and
tell
us
what
was
said”
and
of
course
that
was
objected
to,
but
that
was
allowed
to
come
in.
it’s
our
contention
that
it
should
be
spelled
out
that
now
is
the
appropriate
time,
the
rationale
of
the
bruton
case,
taking
into
account
the
jackson
case
and
others
should
set
down
the
rule
that
the
government,
just
like
in
a
--
question
of
volunteer
confession,
the
trial
judge
should
first
determine
there
is
a
conspiracy
before
he
allows
all
of
this
hearsay
to
come
in
and
then
ask
the
jury
after
you’ve
heard
all
this,
determine
whether
conspiracy
existed.
a
conspiracy
case
is
a
difficult
case
to
try.
the
record
shows
that
every
piece
of
hearsay
and
double
hearsay
was
brought
into
this
record
by
the
prosecutor
standing
up
and
saying,
but
your
honor,
this
is
a
conspiracy
case
which
means
everything
goes.
this
--
it’s
our
contention
that
now
is
the
time
and
certainly
if
the
court
doesn’t
feel
that
this
should
be
reversed
on
--
under
the
bruton
rule,
certainly
it
was
prejudicial
and
prejudice
could
have
been
taken
away
by
severance.
and
certainly
with
the
obstacles,
the
difficulties
the
court
of
appeals
found
in
this
that
the
judge,
the
trial
judge
found,
certainly
it
should
have
been
known
that
we
could
have
avoided
any
of
this
by
having
a
separate
trial
and
we’ll
never
know.
of
course,
we
concede
the
jury
convicted,
but
we’ll
never
know,
how
they
would
have
weighed
the
testimony
of
the
two
witnesses
against
the
petitioner
herein
had
their
minds
not
been
cluttered
with
all
these
other
things
that
i
couldn’t
remove
from
the
jury
just
as
i
couldn’t
remove
myself
from
the
counsel
table
where
we
were
required
to
be
by
the
court.
and
it’s
our
contention
that
this
case
should
be
reversed
and
remanded
on
our
two
grounds.
