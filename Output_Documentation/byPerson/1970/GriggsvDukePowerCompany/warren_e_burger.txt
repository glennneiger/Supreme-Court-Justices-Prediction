chief

e.
burger
mr.
greenberg,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
this
record
show
the
total
employment
figure
in
1955
and
total
employment
figure
currently?
i
couldn't
spell
it
out.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
wondered
if
that
figure
because
it
certainly
would
be
countered
to
the
general
growth
of
everything
in
15
years.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
prior
to
1955,
did
you
say
there
was
no
high
school
test?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
there
are
--
does
the
record
show
how
many
people
are
in
the
non-labor
force
who
did
not
meet
the
high
school
--
would
not
today
be
able
to
meet
the
high
school?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
that
be
--
does
this
record
show
how
that
compares
with
the
change
in
standards
generally
and
this
are
comparable
industries
that
i
assume
many
people
today
will
have
requirements
it
be
the
high
school
or
college
who
did
not
have
it
15
or
20
years
ago
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
this
show
any
hideous
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
that
have
a
--
would
that
have
validity
and
promotability
aspect
of
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
would
it
be
a
violation
of
the
act
if
an
employer
had
a
general
policy
that
he
would
not
hire
anyone
in
any
capacity
if
they
didn't
meet
certain
potential
promotability
qualifications?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
that's
the
key
to
your
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
the
impact
of
any
tests
screens
out
one
particular
category
whether
it
happens
to
be
women
or
negroes
or
orientals
or
whatever,
then
its
--
it
at
least
suspect
to
such?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
if
the
power
plant
in
let
us
say
the
state
of
maine
on
the
assumption
that
they
would
be
almost
all
white
population
there,
if
the
power
plant
in
the
state
of
maine
had
a
high
school
or
other
aptitude
test
that
was
directed
promotability
and
it
did
not
have
any
impact
--
adverse
impact
on
any
particular
racial
group
or
national
origin
group.
it
would
not
put
to
the
act?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
no
violation
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
alright,
mr.
greenberg.
mr.
ferguson.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
there
were
no
high
school
graduation
requirements
to
the
labor
force,
how
do
you
suggest
that
would
adversely
affect
the
company's
operation?
what's
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
i
misheard
you.
i
thought
you
said
every
person
hired
on
the
labor
force.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
glad
you
corrected
that.
i
thought
your
statement
was
in
conflict
with
what
i
remembered
in
the
rest.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
see
if
i
can
translate
what
you've
said
in
terms
of
the
factual
situation
on
this
record
but
the
operation
of
it
if
a
man,
if
any
racial
or
a
national
origin
is
hired
in
the
labor
department
now
without
a
high
school
education
or
any
other
tests.
and
at
some
point,
things
he
can
qualify
for
one
of
the
other
operating
departments
of
the
company.
is
he
permitted
to
--
does
he
come
within
this
group
whose
tuition
is
paid
three-fourths
by
the
company?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
if
you
access
the
test,
he
can
join
in
this
upward
movement?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
to
get
out
of
it
and
move
on?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
since
these
tests
have
been
an
inaugurated
since
this
policy
is
in
effect,
how
many
people
have
move
out
of
the
labor
force
by
this
rout
into
other
branches?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
had
all
three
of
them
taken
the
training
course
at
the
shared
expense
of
the
company?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
there
is
a
claim
that
the
tests
is
an
inherently
an
unfair
tests,
so
far
as
negroes
are
concerned.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that
is
--
do
i
understand
the
claim
in
opposition
correctly?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
what
they're
asking
is
that
you
tailor
a
new
test
that
will
be
directed
at
the
particular
job
ahead.
chief

warren
e.

what

were
you
on
precisely?
chief

warren
e.
burger
let
me
see
if
i
can
focus
with
you
for
a
moment
on
the
difference
that
you
suggested
existed
between
the
department
of
justice
position
previously
and
now.
chief

warren
e.

on
page
38,
the
italicized

that
you
were
referring
to
i
think,
does
the

relates
to
the

or
enterprise,
the
business
or
enterprise
not
to
the
specific
jobs
that's
what
the
department
of

said
in
that

the
department
of
justice
seems
to
be
saying
now,
do
you
suggest
that
the
amendment
concerning
the
tests
relates
to
specific
jobs
as
distinguished
from
enterprise?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
general
ability
and
intelligence
tests
wouldn't
universally
relate
to
specific
jobs,
would
they?
would
you
ponder
on
that
at
lunch
while
we
recess?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
cohen.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
cohen,
let
me
put
this
question
to
you
if
i
can.
assume
area
of
the
country
where
i
suppose
in
the
southwest
there
are
people
whose
primary
language
is
spanish
and
have
a
rather
limited
comprehension
of
english.
suppose
an
employer
provided
for
farmworkers
that
they
must
pass
the
test,
something
like
a
literacy
test
in
english
on
official
that
would
be
a
rational
request
generally
from
employers
i'm
sure.
its
impact
in
the
southwest
in
that
particular
area
for
the
farmworkers
might
have
no
relationship
at
all
to
the
job,
might
or
might
not,
wouldn't
that
bring
it
under
the
act
if
the
impact
was
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
does
the
duke,
does
it
go
that
far
that
it
must
be
a
subterfuge
or
is
it
on
the
impact?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
would
you
regard
business
necessity
and
business
related
as
being
the
same
or
as
one
stronger
than
the
other?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let
me
be
sure
that
i
understand
your
response
to
my
hypothetical
question.
if
the
fruit
pickers
and
farmworkers
down
the
southwest
had
this
english
language
test,
you'd
regard
that
as
not
very
job
related?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
command
of
english
would
be
relevant
only
to
the
extent
that
was
necessary
to
understand
the
instructions,
isn't
that
about
that?
chief

warren
e.

thank
you
mr.
cohen.
mr.
greenberg
you
have
about
10
minutes
left.
chief

that's
about
one-fourth

isn't
it?
chief

let's
locate
our
spot
first.
chief

warren
e.
burger
alright.
fine.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
ask
you
this
mr.
greenberg.
suppose
in
terms
of
eligibility
to
intern
in
a
hospital.
the
hospital
standard
required
that
they
be
persons
whose
scholastic
training
and
general
aptitude
is
measured
by
some
reasonable
tests,
such
that
they
would
be
qualified
to
become
staff
members.
in

alone,
would
you
grant
that
as
a
reasonable
criteria?
chief
justice
warren
e.

the
implication
of
my
question
are
that
some
medical

ultimate
test
of
