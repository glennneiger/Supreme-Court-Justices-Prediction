mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
here
today
to
determine
the
rights,
duties,
and
obligations
of
employers
and
employees
in
private
employment.
in
the
mid
1950s
as
has
been
indicated
to
you,
duke
power
company
adopted
a
practice
of
requiring
a
high
school
education
for
promotion
or
hiring
into
all
departments
other
than
the
labor
departments
at
its
steams
stations.
the
heart
of
this
case
is
whether
or
not
that
practice
is
discriminatory
under
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
as
to
four
negroes
who
were
hired
after
the
adoption
of
that
requirement.
since
adoption
of
the
requirement,
no
employee
white
or
black
has
been
hired
into
departments
other
than
the
labor
department
unless
he
had
a
high
school
education.
a
collateral
issue
in
this
case
in
our
view
is
whether
or
not
the
tests
used
by
the
company
as
a
substitute
for
the
high
school
requirement
violates
the
act.
petitioners
assert
that
the
educational
requirement
is
discriminatory
because
it
fails
to
meet
the
test
of
business
necessity.
to
meet
that
test,
petitioners
claim
that
any
such
requirement
must
be
validated
for
job
relatedness.
on
the
other
hand,
the
company
claims
and
the
district
court
below
and
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
below
found
and
concluded
that
under
the
record,
evidence
in
this
case,
the
educational
requirement
had
a
genuine
business
purpose
and
was
adopted
to
upgrade
the
quality
of
the
defendant's
workforce
and
was
not
adopted
with
any
intent
to
discriminate
against
negroes
hired
after
adoption
of
the
requirement.
the
uncontradicted
evidence
of
record
in
this
case
is
that
employees
and
the
operations
and
maintenance
department
are
responsible
for
the
safe,
efficient,
and
reliable
operations
and
maintenance
of
complex
machinery
used
in
the
production
of
electric
and
energy.
those
in
the
laboratory
department
must
be
able
to
perform
laboratory
conditions
--
operations
which
include
water
analysis,
coal
analysis
and
keep
accurate
logs
with
respect
to
those
operations.
those
in
the
test
department
must
maintain
the
accuracy
of
instruments,
gauges,
and
control
devices.
employees
in
coal
handling
must
be
able
to
read
and
understand
manuals
relating
to
complex
machinery
and
operate
that
machinery
in
order
to
progress
through
the
coal
handling
classification
satisfactorily.
all
of
these
jobs
we
submit
to
you
require
a
degree
of
skill,
judgment,
and
intelligence
and
we
would
respectfully
say
to
you
that
it
supports
the
company's
decision
to
require
in
overall
general
intelligence
and
mechanical
comprehension
level
as
reasonably
necessary
to
safely
and
efficiently
operate
a
plant
costing
millions
of
dollars
which
performs
a
complex
function
of
electric
power
production
which
this
company
as
a
public
utility
is
required
by
law
to
maintain
adequate
and
continuous
service.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
there
is
no
high
school
requirement
for
the
labor
force,
may
it
please,
your
honor.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
no,
sir.
every
person
hired
since
1955,
in
all
departments
other
than
the
labor
department
have
a
high
school
education.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
thank
you
for
calling
my
attention
sir.
in
addition,
this
record
shows
that
--
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
yes
and
he
must
also
pass
these
tests.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
he
must
do
both.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
yes.
he
must
have
a
high
school
education
requirement
and
he
must
pass
the
test
with
the
score
of
the
average
high
school
graduate.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
the
test
that
we
use
here
must
--
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
yes,
that
is
for
new
employees
only.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
the
test
here
may
it
please
your
honor
were
utilize
as
an
alternate
for
the
high
school
requirement
as
to
give
incumbents
only
not
new
employee
but
incumbents
only,
the
chance
to
enter
and
progress
into
the
higher
skill
lines
of
progression
without
the
necessity
of
having
a
high
school
education.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it
must
make
20
on
the
wonderlic
and
39
on
the
bennett
mechanical.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
no,
sir.
they
have
to
take
a
revised
beta
tests
that
is
not
in
this
appendix
but
they
take
revised
beta
tests
which
really
is
no
more
than
just
an
appreciation
of
danger
and
understanding
of
how
to
follow
instructions.
in
addition,
i
would
say
to
you
that
mr.
act
who
is
the
vice-president
of
power
production
and
in
charge
of
steam
plants
on
our
company
system
stated
that
the
company
instituted
the
high
school
requirement
because
its
business
was
becoming
more
complex.
it
had
employees
who
are
unable
to
grasp
situations
to
read,
to
write,
and
who
didn't
have
an
intelligence
level
really
to
progress
upward
in
the
higher
skill
lines
of
progression
that
were
talking
about
and
in
fact
some
refuse
promotion
because
they
didn't
feel
that
they
could
do
the
job.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
interdepartmental
transfer.
we,
i
was
--
at
that
point
your
honor,
i
was
saying
this,
that
we
found
that
we
were
getting
some
road
blocks,
well
because
we
had
hired
people
without
a
high
school
education
and
without
the
mechanical
and
general
intelligence
level
that
ultimately,
in
view
of
our
business
become
a
more
complex.
we
were
hiring
people
and
we
were
suffering
road
blocks
and
these
tests
and
as
the
petitioners
only
evidence
were
designed
to
exclude
--
to
include
not
exclude
anybody
without
a
high
school
education.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
they
have
three
non-discriminatory
alternatives
about
which
they
can
travel
into
the
other,
the
higher
skill
lines
of
progression.
one,
they
could
take
the
tests
and
make
satisfaction
scores
in
progress
or
two,
they
could
take
advantage
of
the
company's
tuition
refund
program
which
we
pay
75%
of
the
costs
of
and
get
a
high
school
diploma
or
ged
equivalent,
or
they
can
do
it
on
their
own.
they
have
those
three
alternatives.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
the
record
makes
that
clear.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
this
is
for
incumbents
about
which
we
are
talking
only.
remember
the
court
below
cured
its
termination
as
to
the
six
black
employees
who
were
contemporaneously
hired
with
or
after
the
whites
who
were
hired
into
the
better
departments
and
have
been
progress
in
law
and
order
that
when
the
district
court
fashioned
a
decree
that
it
would
take
those
six
employees,
waive
the
education
and
test
requirement
as
to
them
and
require
plant
lab
rather
than
departmental
seniority
with
respect
thereto.
does
that
answer
your
question,
sir?
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
as
to
the
three
high
school
graduates
they
were
all
promoted
after
the
civil
rights
act
became
effective
on
july
2,
1965.
they
were
all
promoted
out
of
labor
into
the
higher
skill
lines
of
progression
and
which
we
would
contend
is
the
precise
effect
congress
intended.
because
both
courts
below
found
and
concluded
that
negroes
were
relegated
to
the
labor
department
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
act.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
if
he
comes
in
without
a
--
i
see
your
point
mr.
chief
justice,
if
he
comes
in
at
the
--
in
the
labor
department
without
a
high
school
education,
your
question
is
does
he
have
to
pass
the
test
and
have
a
high
school
education
requirement
also,
is
that
true?
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
he
could
take
the
tests
and
move
on.
we're
speaking
about
new
hires
into
departments
other
than
labor
must
have
a
high
education
and
in
addition
thereto
pass
these
two
tests
that
we're
talking
about.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
through
the
testing
rout?
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
as
indicated
earlier,
three
--
two
blacks
and
one
white
have
passed
the
tests
--
have
taken
the
tests
but
not
passed.
so,
none
have
moved
out
by
virtue
of
the
additional
promotional
avenue
we
gave
them.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
no
sir,
they
have
not.
one
--
we
have
one
who
has
recently
passed
or
given
as
or
shown
a
satisfactory
evidence
of
a
high
school
education.
he
is
now
the
labor
department
foreman.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
sir?
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
a
mr.
richard
lemons
at
this
particular
plant,
justice
black.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
don't
believe
anyone
else
at
this
particular
plant.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
no,
sir.
they
passed
by
that.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
alright
your
honor,
may
i
speak
of
that
just
a
moment?
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
they
claim
the
tests
as
to
negroes
are
unfair
because
they
are
culturally
deprived
and
therefore
placed
at
a
competitive
disadvantage.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
yes,
sir
and
i
would
respectfully
submit
to
you
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
clearly
showed
that
general
intelligence
and
aptitude
tests
that
congress
intended
they
should
be
used.
and
i'd
point
specifically
to
senator
tower's
language.
this
is
all
discussed
in
pages
27-340
of
the
brief.
i
would
direct
the
court's
--
the
attention
of
the
court
to
this
when
senator
tower
called
up
his
original
amendment,
he
stated,
“it
is
an
effort
to
protect
the
system
whereby
employers
give
general
ability
and
intelligence
tests
to
determine
the
trainability
of
employees.”
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
that
is
page
31
of
our
brief,
your
honor.
if
you'll
go
on
over
to
page
32,
you
will
see
senator
lawshe's
questions
demanding
to
know
where
there
is
language
in
this
field
that
allows
the
motorola
type
test
be
given.
i
would
point
out
even
more
particularly
to
you
on
page
38
the
clark
case
interpretative
memorandum
prepared
by
the
justice
department
which
states
this.
there
is
no
requirement
in
title
vii
that
employers
abandon
bona
fide
classification
tests
where
because
of
differences
and
background
and
education,
members
of
some
groups
are
able
to
perform
better
on
these
tests
than
members
of
other
groups.
an
employer
may
set
his
qualifications
as
a
high
as
he
likes.
he
may
test
to
determine
which
applicants
have
these
qualifications
and
he
may
hire,
assign,
and
promote
on
the
basis
of
tests
performance.
now
the
justice
department
through
the
solicitor
general's
amicus
curiae
apparently
now
claims
that
the
tests
breveted
only
if
they're
specifically
job
related
and
apparently
repudiates
the
interpretative
memorandum
on
which
congress
of
the
united
states
relied
when
it
enact
that
legislation.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
well,
may
i
answer
that
this
way.
the
bennett
and
the
wonderlic
are
of
course
professionally
developed
tests.
that
alone
we
realized
is
not
enough.
the
courts
below
found
that
we
have
a
genuine
business
purpose
in
adopting
the
high
school
education
requirement
when
they
found
that
the
tests
were
a
reasonably
satisfactory
substitute
for
the
high
school
education
requirement.
now,
if
we
assume
that
the
tests
are
professionally
developed
ability
tests
and
that
congress
intended
to
allow
the
use
of
general
aptitude
and
ability
tests
then
and
in
that
event
the
crucial
inquiry
becomes
this.
are
the
tests
designed,
used,
or
intended
to
discriminate.
now,
as
to
design,
the
two
testing
question
here
were
designed
by
professional
psychologists.
the
record
evidence
shows
that
the
wonderlic
was
designed
to
measure
general
intelligence
and
that
the
bennett
mechanical
aa
was
designed
to
measure
mechanical
comprehension.
the
use
--
the
use
of
the
two
tests
are
as
a
substitute
for
the
high
school
education
requirement.
purely
and
simply
to
determine
if
the
employee
has
a
general
intelligence
overall
mechanical
comprehension
level
of
the
average
high
school
graduate.
what
about
the
intent?
well,
once
the
employer
establishes
a
legitimate
business
purpose
for
an
employment
practice
testing
or
otherwise,
then
that
practice
is
non-discriminatory
even
if
it
operates
to
prefer
whites
over
black.
if
the
intent
and
the
legitimate
business
purpose
are
inextricably
bound
up
together
i
would
submit
to
the
court.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
well
sir,
i
would
submit
to
you
that
it's
factually
impossible
to
use
it
to
discriminate
in
this
case
as
i
point
out
on
page
26
on
our
brief.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
alright,
sir.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
apparently
so,
what
you're
referring
to
mr.
chief
justice
is
the
first
tower
amendment.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
and
this
--
i
believe
the
clark
case
interpretative
memorandum
was
submitted
after
the
first
tower
amendment.
i
am
not
sure
about
that
but
the
language
i
had
reference
to
is
on
page
31
of
the
brief.
down
about
middle
of
the
page
where
he
said
it
is
an
effort
to
protect
the
system.
i
would
point
out
also
to
you
that
both
the
eeoc
has
held
that
educational
qualifications
don't
violate
the
act.
i
believe
you'll
find
that
as
appendix
exhibit
number
4.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
if
you
please,
your
honors,
someone
else
has
10
minutes
of
my
time
[laughing].
[lunch
recess]
findings
and
conclusions
of
the
court
below
should
not
be
set
aside
unless
they're
found
to
be
clearly
erroneous
and
in
closing
i
would
comment
on
the
petitioner's
argument
that
the
educational
test
requirement
has
a
vast
discriminatory
potential.
that
simply
is
not
a
valid
contention
because
the
lower
court
carefully
guarded
against
the
broad
approval
of
all
educational
and
testing
requirements
by
restricting
its
decision
solely
to
the
facts
of
this
case
and
that
decision
should,
we
respectfully
submit,
be
affirmed.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
yes
sir,
that
is
correct.
one
negro
who
had
a
high
school
education
was
not
a
plaintiff.
there
are
14
negroes
employed
at
the
dan
river
steam
station,
one
of
which
had
been
promoted
in
the
coal
handling
and
was
not
a
plaintiff
in
this
action.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
here
today
to
determine
the
rights,
duties,
and
obligations
of
employers
and
employees
in
private
employment.
in
the
mid
1950s
as
has
been
indicated
to
you,
duke
power
company
adopted
a
practice
of
requiring
a
high
school
education
for
promotion
or
hiring
into
all
departments
other
than
the
labor
departments
at
its
steams
stations.
the
heart
of
this
case
is
whether
or
not
that
practice
is
discriminatory
under
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
as
to
four
negroes
who
were
hired
after
the
adoption
of
that
requirement.
since
adoption
of
the
requirement,
no
employee
white
or
black
has
been
hired
into
departments
other
than
the
labor
department
unless
he
had
a
high
school
education.
a
collateral
issue
in
this
case
in
our
view
is
whether
or
not
the
tests
used
by
the
company
as
a
substitute
for
the
high
school
requirement
violates
the
act.
petitioners
assert
that
the
educational
requirement
is
discriminatory
because
it
fails
to
meet
the
test
of
business
necessity.
to
meet
that
test,
petitioners
claim
that
any
such
requirement
must
be
validated
for
job
relatedness.
on
the
other
hand,
the
company
claims
and
the
district
court
below
and
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
below
found
and
concluded
that
under
the
record,
evidence
in
this
case,
the
educational
requirement
had
a
genuine
business
purpose
and
was
adopted
to
upgrade
the
quality
of
the
defendant's
workforce
and
was
not
adopted
with
any
intent
to
discriminate
against
negroes
hired
after
adoption
of
the
requirement.
the
uncontradicted
evidence
of
record
in
this
case
is
that
employees
and
the
operations
and
maintenance
department
are
responsible
for
the
safe,
efficient,
and
reliable
operations
and
maintenance
of
complex
machinery
used
in
the
production
of
electric
and
energy.
those
in
the
laboratory
department
must
be
able
to
perform
laboratory
conditions
--
operations
which
include
water
analysis,
coal
analysis
and
keep
accurate
logs
with
respect
to
those
operations.
those
in
the
test
department
must
maintain
the
accuracy
of
instruments,
gauges,
and
control
devices.
employees
in
coal
handling
must
be
able
to
read
and
understand
manuals
relating
to
complex
machinery
and
operate
that
machinery
in
order
to
progress
through
the
coal
handling
classification
satisfactorily.
all
of
these
jobs
we
submit
to
you
require
a
degree
of
skill,
judgment,
and
intelligence
and
we
would
respectfully
say
to
you
that
it
supports
the
company's
decision
to
require
in
overall
general
intelligence
and
mechanical
comprehension
level
as
reasonably
necessary
to
safely
and
efficiently
operate
a
plant
costing
millions
of
dollars
which
performs
a
complex
function
of
electric
power
production
which
this
company
as
a
public
utility
is
required
by
law
to
maintain
adequate
and
continuous
service.
mr.

there
is
no
high
school
requirement
for
the
labor

may
it
please,
your
honor.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,

no,
sir.
every
person
hired
since
1955,
in
all
departments
other
than
the

have
a
high

education.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
thank
you
for
calling
my
attention
sir.
in

this

shows
that

mr.

yes,
sir.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.

yes
and
he
must
also
pass
these

mr.
george
w.
ferguson,

yes,
sir.
he
must
do
both.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,

yes.
he
must
have
a
high

requirement
and
he
must
pass
the

with
the
score
of
the
average
high

graduate.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
the
test
that
we
use
here
must
--
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
yes,
that
is
for
new
employees
only.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
the
test
here
may
it
please
your
honor
were
utilize
as
an
alternate
for
the
high
school
requirement
as
to
give
incumbents
only
not
new

but
incumbents
only,
the
chance
to
enter
and
progress
into
the
higher
skill
lines
of
progression
without
the
necessity
of
having
a
high

mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it
must
make
20

the

mr.

yes,

mr.

no,
sir.
they
have
to
take
a
revised
beta
tests
that
is
not
in
this
appendix
but
they
take
revised
beta
tests
which
really
is
no
more
than
just
an
appreciation
of
danger
and
understanding
of
how
to
follow
instructions.
in
addition,
i
would
say
to
you
that
mr.
act
who
is
the
vice-president
of
power
production
and
in
charge
of
steam
plants
on
our
company
system
stated
that
the
company
instituted
the
high
school
requirement
because
its
business
was
becoming
more
complex.
it
had
employees
who
are
unable
to
grasp
situations
to
read,
to
write,
and
who
didn't
have
an
intelligence
level
really
to
progress
upward
in
the
higher
skill
lines
of
progression
that
were
talking
about
and
in
fact
some
refuse
promotion
because
they
didn't
feel
that
they
could
do
the
job.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
interdepartmental
transfer.
we,
i
was
--
at
that
point
your
honor,
i
was
saying
this,
that
we
found
that
we
were
getting
some
road
blocks,
well
because
we
had
hired
people
without
a
high
school
education
and
without
the
mechanical
and
general
intelligence
level
that
ultimately,
in
view
of
our
business
become
a
more
complex.
we
were
hiring
people
and
we
were
suffering
road
blocks
and
these
tests
and
as
the
petitioners
only
evidence
were
designed
to
exclude
--
to
include
not
exclude
anybody
without
a
high
school
education.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
they
have
three
non-discriminatory
alternatives
about
which
they
can
travel
into
the
other,
the
higher
skill
lines
of
progression.
one,
they
could
take
the
tests
and
make
satisfaction
scores
in
progress
or
two,
they
could
take
advantage
of
the
company's
tuition
refund
program
which
we
pay
75%
of
the
costs
of
and
get
a
high
school
diploma
or
ged
equivalent,
or
they
can
do
it
on
their
own.
they
have
those
three
alternatives.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
the
record
makes
that
clear.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
this
is
for
incumbents
about
which
we
are
talking
only.
remember
the
court
below
cured
its
termination
as
to
the
six
black
employees
who
were
contemporaneously
hired
with
or
after
the
whites
who
were
hired
into
the
better
departments
and
have
been
progress
in
law
and
order
that
when
the
district
court
fashioned
a
decree
that
it
would
take
those
six
employees,
waive
the
education
and
test
requirement
as
to
them
and
require
plant
lab
rather
than
departmental
seniority
with
respect
thereto.
does
that
answer
your
question,
sir?
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
as
to
the
three
high
school
graduates
they
were
all
promoted
after
the
civil
rights
act
became
effective
on
july
2,
1965.
they
were
all
promoted
out
of
labor
into
the
higher
skill
lines
of
progression
and
which
we
would
contend
is
the
precise
effect
congress
intended.
because
both
courts
below
found
and
concluded
that
negroes
were
relegated
to
the
labor
department
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
act.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
if
he
comes
in
without
a
--
i
see
your
point
mr.
chief
justice,
if
he
comes
in
at
the
--
in
the
labor
department
without
a
high
school
education,
your
question
is
does
he
have
to
pass
the
test
and
have
a
high
school
education
requirement
also,
is
that
true?
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
he
could
take
the
tests
and
move
on.
we're
speaking
about
new
hires
into
departments
other
than
labor
must
have
a
high
education
and
in
addition
thereto
pass
these
two
tests
that
we're
talking
about.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
through
the
testing
rout?
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
as
indicated
earlier,
three
--
two
blacks
and
one
white
have
passed
the
tests
--
have
taken
the
tests
but
not
passed.
so,
none
have
moved
out
by
virtue
of
the
additional
promotional
avenue
we
gave
them.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
no
sir,
they
have
not.
one
--
we
have
one
who
has
recently
passed
or
given
as
or
shown
a
satisfactory
evidence
of
a
high
school
education.
he
is
now
the
labor
department
foreman.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
sir?
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
a
mr.
richard
lemons
at
this
particular
plant,
justice
black.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
don't
believe
anyone
else
at
this
particular
plant.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
no,
sir.
they
passed
by
that.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
alright
your
honor,
may
i
speak
of
that
just
a
moment?
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
they
claim
the
tests
as
to
negroes
are
unfair
because
they
are
culturally
deprived
and
therefore
placed
at
a
competitive
disadvantage.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
yes,
sir
and
i
would
respectfully
submit
to
you
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
clearly
showed
that
general
intelligence
and
aptitude
tests
that
congress
intended
they
should
be
used.
and
i'd
point
specifically
to
senator
tower's
language.
this
is
all
discussed
in
pages
27-340
of
the
brief.
i
would
direct
the
court's
--
the
attention
of
the
court
to
this
when
senator
tower
called
up
his
original
amendment,
he
stated,
“it
is
an
effort
to
protect
the
system
whereby
employers
give
general
ability
and
intelligence
tests
to
determine
the
trainability
of
employees.”
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
that
is
page
31
of
our
brief,
your
honor.
if
you'll
go
on
over
to
page
32,
you
will
see
senator
lawshe's
questions
demanding
to
know
where
there
is
language
in
this
field
that
allows
the
motorola
type
test
be
given.
i
would
point
out
even
more
particularly
to
you
on
page
38
the
clark
case
interpretative
memorandum
prepared
by
the
justice
department
which
states
this.
there
is
no
requirement
in
title
vii
that
employers
abandon
bona
fide
classification
tests
where
because
of
differences
and
background
and
education,
members
of
some
groups
are
able
to
perform
better
on
these
tests
than
members
of
other
groups.
an
employer
may
set
his
qualifications
as
a
high
as
he
likes.
he
may
test
to
determine
which
applicants
have
these
qualifications
and
he
may
hire,
assign,
and
promote
on
the
basis
of
tests
performance.
now
the
justice
department
through
the
solicitor
general's
amicus
curiae
apparently
now
claims
that
the
tests
breveted
only
if
they're
specifically
job
related
and
apparently
repudiates
the
interpretative
memorandum
on
which
congress
of
the
united
states
relied
when
it
enact
that
legislation.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
well,
may
i
answer
that
this
way.
the
bennett
and
the
wonderlic
are
of
course
professionally
developed
tests.
that
alone
we
realized
is
not
enough.
the
courts
below
found
that
we
have
a
genuine
business
purpose
in
adopting
the
high
school
education
requirement
when
they
found
that
the
tests
were
a
reasonably
satisfactory
substitute
for
the
high
school
education
requirement.
now,
if
we
assume
that
the
tests
are
professionally
developed
ability
tests
and
that
congress
intended
to
allow
the
use
of
general
aptitude
and
ability
tests
then
and
in
that
event
the
crucial
inquiry
becomes
this.
are
the
tests
designed,
used,
or
intended
to
discriminate.
now,
as
to
design,
the
two
testing
question
here
were
designed
by
professional
psychologists.
the
record
evidence
shows
that
the
wonderlic
was
designed
to
measure
general
intelligence
and
that
the
bennett
mechanical
aa
was
designed
to
measure
mechanical
comprehension.
the
use
--
the
use
of
the
two
tests
are
as
a
substitute
for
the
high
school
education
requirement.
purely
and
simply
to
determine
if
the
employee
has
a
general
intelligence
overall
mechanical
comprehension
level
of
the
average
high
school
graduate.
what
about
the
intent?
well,
once
the
employer
establishes
a
legitimate
business
purpose
for
an
employment
practice
testing
or
otherwise,
then
that
practice
is
non-discriminatory
even
if
it
operates
to
prefer
whites
over
black.
if
the
intent
and
the
legitimate
business
purpose
are
inextricably
bound
up
together
i
would
submit
to
the
court.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
well
sir,
i
would
submit
to
you
that
it's
factually
impossible
to
use
it
to
discriminate
in
this
case
as
i
point
out
on
page
26
on
our
brief.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
alright,
sir.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
apparently
so,
what
you're
referring
to
mr.
chief
justice
is
the
first
tower
amendment.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
and
this
--
i
believe
the
clark
case
interpretative
memorandum
was
submitted
after
the
first
tower
amendment.
i
am
not
sure
about
that
but
the
language
i
had
reference
to
is
on
page
31
of
the
brief.
down
about
middle
of
the
page
where
he
said
it
is
an
effort
to
protect
the
system.
i
would
point
out
also
to
you
that
both
the
eeoc
has
held
that
educational
qualifications
don't
violate
the
act.
i
believe
you'll
find
that
as
appendix
exhibit
number
4.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
if
you
please,
your
honors,
someone
else
has
10
minutes
of
my
time
[laughing].
[lunch
recess]
findings
and
conclusions
of
the
court
below
should
not
be
set
aside
unless
they're
found
to
be
clearly
erroneous
and
in
closing
i
would
comment
on
the
petitioner's
argument
that
the
educational
test
requirement
has
a
vast
discriminatory
potential.
that
simply
is
not
a
valid
contention
because
the
lower
court
carefully
guarded
against
the
broad
approval
of
all
educational
and
testing
requirements
by
restricting
its
decision
solely
to
the
facts
of
this
case
and
that
decision
should,
we
respectfully
submit,
be
affirmed.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
yes
sir,
that
is
correct.
one
negro
who
had
a
high
school
education
was
not
a
plaintiff.
there
are
14
negroes
employed
at
the
dan
river
steam
station,
one
of
which
had
been
promoted
in
the
coal
handling
and
was
not
a
plaintiff
in
this
action.
mr.
george
w.
ferguson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
