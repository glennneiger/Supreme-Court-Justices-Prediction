mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
which
affirmed
in
court
and
reversed
in
court
a
decision
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
middle
district
of
north
carolina
by
decision
in
which
judge
sobeloff
dissented.
the
issue
is
one
of
statutory
construction
of
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
and
the
particular
statutory
provision
for
which
i
would
like
to
draw
the
court's
attention
appears
on
page
2
of
our
brief.
the
statute
makes
it
unlawful
employment
practice
for
an
employer
to
fail
or
refuse
to
hire
or
to
discharge
any
individual
or
otherwise
to
discriminate
against
him
with
regard
to
race.
and
then
in
section
2
which
more
particularly
applies
to
the
issue
we
have
pending
here
to
limit,
segregate,
or
classify
his
employees
in
any
way
which
would
deprive
or
tend
to
deprive
any
individual
of
employment
opportunity
or
otherwise
adversely
affect
the
status
as
an
employee
because
of
race
and
other
forbidden
reasons.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
intelligence
tests
and
a
high
school
graduation
requirement
may
be
use
as
a
pre-requisite
to
promotion
from
the
job
of
laborer
to
the
job
of
coal-handler
and
perhaps
other
jobs
at
respondent's
power
plant.
when
these
tests,
that
is
the
intelligence
tests
which
i
might
say
was
adopted
on
july
2,
1965,
the
effective
date
of
the
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
when
these
tests
screen
out
negroes
at
a
significantly
higher
rate
than
they
screen
out
whites
and
there
has
been
no
demonstration
that
the
tests
and
the
high
school
requirement
predict
ability
to
do
the
job
and
indeed
there
is
some
evidence
to
the
contrary
that
they
do
not
predict
the
ability
to
do
the
job.
now,
the
court
below
held
in
the
case
of
employees
employed
after
the
high
school
requirement
was
instituted
that
the
statute
was
not
violated
and
as
i
read
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
and
the
position
of
respondents,
they
rests
on
three
separate
grounds,
that
first
of
all
that
there
was
no
demonstration
of
an
intent
to
discriminate.
secondly,
there's
a
statutory
argument
and
that
is
that
such
tests
are
privileged
as
“professionally
developed
ability
tests”
under
section
703
(h)
of
title
vii
and
then
there
is
an
assertion
by
the
respondent
which
we
say
has
no
support
in
the
record.
in
fact,
the
record
in
some
parts
of
the
country
that
the
test
survey
legitimate
business
need
that
is
that
certain
employees
are
not
fully
promotable
throughout
the
plant
to
higher
positions
and
that
the
high
school
education
requirements
help
select
employees
who
are.
now,
before
elaborating
our
argument,
we
would
like
to
make
our
position
clear
with
regard
to
ability
testing.
no
employer,
we
submit
under
the
statute
is
required
to
employ
anyone
who
is
unable
to
do
the
job
and
any
employer
may
use
tests
and
educational
requirements
which
predict
whether
an
employee
or
perspective
employee
can
do
the
job.
but
if
the
tests
that's
used
or
the
educational
requirement
that's
used
screens
out
members
of
a
race
or
of
a
group
protected
by
the
statute
and
does
not
predict
who
can
do
the
job
or
does
not
have
predictive
validity
as
the
industrial
psychologist
use
the
terminus
this
record
use
the
term,
then
it
cannot
be
justified
merely
on
the
basis
of
good
faith.
a
good
faith
or
intent,
we
submit
is
an
elusive
concept
which
regularly,
frequently
is
advance
in
civil
rights
cases.
we
hear
good
faith
defenses
in
school
segregation
cases,
in
jury
discrimination
cases,
in
voting
discrimination
cases
and
the
courts
have
regularly
responded
that
they
look
to
results
and
not
make
an
effort
to
read
the
mind
of
an
employer
or
indeed
something
much
more
difficult
to
do
to
read
the
mind
of
a
corporation
as
to
what
it
intends
to
do
by
the
application
of
certain
standards
and
tests.
indeed,
while
it
has
not
been
possible
on
this
record
to
challenge
the
good
faith
of
the
respondent
because
that's
just
something
that
one
can
very
rarely
develop
evidence
on.
such
a
test
would
be
an
invitation
to
many
who
would
seek
to
evade
the
statute
to
hide
behind
the
concept
of
good
faith.
now
as
i
said
duke
power
company
adopted
the
test
requirement
for
initial
employment
on
july
2,
1965
the
date
of
the
act
in
question.
until
then
and
until
after
the
filing
of
the
charge
in
this
case
in
fact,
employment
of
duke
power
company
was
rigidly
racially
segregated.
black
persons
worked
in
the
labor
department
only.
white
persons
worked
in
the
better
and
higher
paying
jobs,
that
is
the
departments
described
in
the
record
of
operations,
maintenance,
test
and
laboratory,
and
coal
handling.
and
the
highest
paid
black
worker
made
less
money
than
the
lowest
paid
white
worker
under
the
system.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
well,
at
one
time
(voice
overlap)
there
was
a
white
foreman
in
the
labor
department.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
first
formulation
is
the
correct
one.
there
was
rigid
racial
segregation.
the
labor
was
all
black,
everything
else
was
all
white.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
indeed
until
up
until
after
the
filing
of
the
charge
in
this
case
that's
some
time
after
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
think
the
first
black
men
probably
got
out
of
the
labor
department
in
1966,
after
the
filing
of
the
charge
before
the
employment
opportunity.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
is
correct.
there
is
no
question
about
that
on
the
record.
i
don't
think
the
respondent
would
challenge
that
for
a
moment.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
the
intelligence
test
was
put
in
at
the
request
of
certain
non-high
school
graduate
white
workers
in
the
coal
handling
department
as
a
substitute
for
a
high
school
education
and
it
has
been
described
in
the
record
as
a
test
which
would
identify
the
average
high
school
graduate.
so,
it's
perhaps
even
somewhat
more
stringent
in
the
high
school
education
requirement
in
that
that
half
the
high
school
graduates
presumably
would
be
unable
to
pass
these
tests.
and
to
enable
them
to
be
promoted
to
the
so-called
inside
departments,
labor
and
coal
handling
were
outside
only
the
departments
or
inside.
the
high
school
education
requirement
was
adopted
considerably
earlier
and
the
date
is
not
certain
but
it
appears
to
be
people
talk
in
terms
of
about
1955
as
a
pre-requisite
to
employment
and
promotion
in
all
departments
but
the
labor
department.
black
people
can
be
employed
in
labor
without
a
high
school
education.
others
could
be
employed
in
the
other
departments
initially
only
with
a
high
school
education.
but
many
pre-1955
duke
power
employees
are
non-high
school
graduates
at
all
pay
levels
throughout
the
plant
and
indeed,
the
--
our
brief
has
an
analysis
of
the
pay
which
is
earned
by
various
workers.
the
pay
earned
by
an
average
high
school
work
or
an
average
non-high
school
worker
is
about
the
same
the
calculations
are
on
page
38
of
our
brief
and
the
government's
brief
engages
in
a
similar
analysis
of
promotability
comparable
promotability
and
promotion
rates
of
high
school
and
non-high
school
graduates
and
it
finds
that
high
school
and
non-high
school
graduates
within
the
plant
are
roughly
promoted
and
approximately
the
same
rate.
mr.
jack
greenberg
there
--
to
quote
the
respondents
in
this
case
and
i
am
sure
this
is
right.
there
is
“a
real
stable
employment
situation
there
and
there
have
been
roughly
about
95
workers
at
all
times
that
are
relevant
to
this
case.”
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
industry.
it
just
may
be
that
in
the
power
industry,
it's
possible
to
expand
power
production
perhaps
from
other
locations
without
increasing
the
work
force
but
the
employment
situation
has
remained
just
about
the
same.
i
think
that
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
real
doubt
about
that
and
they
characterize
it
as
stable,
and
it
apparently
is.
after
the
passage
of
the
act
and
they
filed
into
complaint
before
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission,
duke
did
promote
a
number
of
black
workers
with
a
high
school
education
over
a
period
of
a
couple
of
years.
and
the
court
of
appeals
then
ordered
the
promotability
but
not
the
actual
promotion
of
others
employed
before
the
high
school
education
requirement
was
adopted
and
that
is
now
in
further
litigation
down
in
the
district
court
because
there
is
a
claim
at
which
the
court
has
not
yet
rendered
any
position
that
some
white
people
have
been
brought
above
this
black
workers.
the
court
has
not
resolved
that.
this
case
involves
four
workers
frozen
in
the
labor
department
by
the
test
requirement
of
july
2,
1965
and
by
the
fact
that
they
have
no
high
school
education.
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
record
is
not
clear
on
who
has
taken
and
who
has
not
taken
these
tests.
the
record
indicates
that
three
of
the
workers,
some
of
them
black
and
some
of
them
white,
we
don't
know
which
to
a
black
which
one
is
white.
half
taken
and
failed
the
test.
everyone
who
has
taken
the
test
has
failed
it.
the
record
indicates
that
applicants
for
employment
almost
entirely
the
overwhelming
number
of
the
client
to
take
the
test.
they
don't
want
to
take
the
test.
this
is
however
class
action
and
our
argument
about
the
test
is
that
it
is
so
patently
discriminatory
as
i
hope
to
develop
in
the
moment
too
that
really
doesn't
matter,
that
doesn't
have
any
real
bearing
on
the
decision
of
the
case.
mr.
jack
greenberg
these
are
four
identifiable
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
class
in
the
complaint
and
in
the
order
allowing
an
amendment
to
the
complaint
is
defined
as
persons
presently
working
at
duke
power
and
those
who
may
be
accepted
for
employment
in
the
future.
so
it
is
in
some
sense
a
rather
well-defined
class
than
in
the
sense
quite
an
open-ended
class.
mr.
jack
greenberg
oh!
yes,
the
district
court
right
on
pages
17
of
the
complaint
files
an
order
allowing
amendment
to
the
complaint
and
defines
it.
well,
then
on
page
19
also,
it's
the
same
thing
again
order
allowing
class
action.
this
action
is
maintainable
as
a
class
action.
only
in
so
far
as
six
injunctive
reliefs
and
so
from
the
class
presented
are
those
represent
--
are
those
negroes
presently
employed
as
well
as
those
who
make
subsequently
be
employed
by
defendant
standard
of
the
station.
both
those
orders
on
page
17
and
19
(a)
may
be
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
that's
not
future
applicants,
those
who
may
subsequently
be
employed.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i'm
sorry,
and
then
on
page
14,
its
also
who
may
subsequently
seek
employment
by
defendant
on
page
14
order
allowing
amendment
to
the
complaint.
so
it's
both.
mr.
jack
greenberg
14
(a)
order
allowing
amendment
to
the
complaint.
mr.
jack
greenberg
who
are
now
employed
that
may
subsequently
seek
employment,
the
first
paragraph,
the
order
line.
and
then
the
opinion
of
the
court
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
we
do
not
know
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
is
correct.
mr.
jack
greenberg
everybody
who's
taken
the
tests
has
failed.
mr.
jack
greenberg
if
--
we
do
not
know.
we
do
not
know.
i
might
then
point
out
the
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
defines
the
class
as
those
who
subsequently
maybe
employed
and
may
hereafter
seek
employment.
that's
in
the
very
sentence
of
judge
forman's
opinion.
as
i
was
saying,
the
case
involves
those
workers
who
want
to
be
promoted
from
labor
to
coal
handling.
now
white
men
without
a
high
school
education
who
have
not
passed
the
tests
and
who
do
not
have
a
high
school
education
are
doing
the
coal
handling
jobs
today.
typically,
the
way
workers
qualify
for
the
coal
handling
job
is
by
on
the
job
training
on
page
124
of
the
larger
volume
of
the
record.
official
of
the
company
testifies.
we
would
have
to
determine
that
by
action
or
actually
putting
them
in
if
there
was
an
opening
to
see
how
they
would
perform.
and
then
he
says,
you
would
take
the
scene,
the
man
if
he
is
qualified
to
go
into
job
and
make
a
trial
of
him
and
try
him
out.
and
then
the
method
of
qualifying
the
job
is
elaborated
also
on
page
23
as
in
response
to
interrogatory
27.
the
company
provides
on-the-job-training.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
the
record
shows
that
there
is
a,
there
is
a
document
filed
by
the
respondents
which
the
education
of
everyone
who
on
page
126
of
this
record
of
everyone
who
works
in
the
plant
by
my
rough
calculation
about
a
third
of
the
people
in
the
plant
do
not
have
a
--
are
not
high
school
graduates.
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
there
is
some
statement
by
respondents
that
elsewhere
in
the
utility
industry
tests
of
this
sort
are
being
used.
but
i
would
like
to
say
that
there
is
first
of
all,
there
is
no
demonstration
to
perform
the
job
of
coal
handler,
you
have
to
have
a
high
school
education.
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
the
labor's
jobs,
the
labor's
jobs
and
the
coal
handler's
jobs,
job
specifications
are
here
in
pages
48
and
65
of
the
record
and
they're
roughly
the
same.
the
coal
handler
just
to
read
a
few
of
them
has
to
operate
certain
vehicle
service
and
clean
coal
handling
equipment
and
be
able
to
record
weight
on
page
48.
on
page
65,
the
labor
has
to
operated
company
vehicles,
operate
floor
sweeping
machines,
tractors,
trucks
and
so
forth,
lift
trucks
and
so
forth.
things
are
comparable.
the
jobs
are
--
people
are
trained
for
the
job,
by
on-the-job
training.
there
is
no
indication
that
the
high
school
education
in
any
way
qualifies
want
to
do
the
job.
and
indeed
if
one
were
to
look
at
the
wonderlic
tests
which
appears
here
on
page
102
of
the
record,
it's
difficult
to
see
how
for
the
qualifications
put
now
for
coal
handler
there
is
any
need
to
know
or
even
have
a
sense
of
the
difference
between
the
words
adopt
and
adept,
reflect
--
reflect
and
reflex,
pretensions
and
pretentious,
image
and
imaginary,
enlarge
and
aggrandize,
and
various
other
kinds
of
test.
mr.
jack
greenberg
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
that
it
would
at
all.
we
do
not
deny
that
there
are
jobs
which
that
kind
of
a
test
or
some
kind
of
a
test
might
have
some
validity.
the
wonderlic
people
who
prepared
the
tests
themselves
say
the
test
is
not
useful
unless
it
has
been
--
unless
it
has
what
they
call
predict
the
validity,
you
have
to
see
whether
or
not
passing
these
tests
qualifies
you
to
do
this
job.
this
test
is
not
an
open
sesame
to
decide
who
can
do
any
job
in
the
whole
world.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
would
not
be
a
violation
of
the
job
if
he
could
demonstrate
that
that
kind
of
capacity
to
be
promotable
is
necessary
to
do
the
job
and
necessary
for
the
operation
if
it
is
planned.
and
then
it
might
not
be
a
violation
either
if
he
did
not
disproportionately
screen
out
members
of
a
protected
race
or
national
group
or
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
the
key.
there
is
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
then
it
must
be
justified
in
terms
of
some
sort
of
validation
of
its
ability
to
predict
and
here
we
have
in
the
state
of
north
carolina,
one-third
as
many
black
people
as
white
people
graduate
from
high
school.
examinations
of
this
wonderlic
test
by
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
and
now
recently
in
the
case
in
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana,
hicks
against
crown-zellerbach
show
that
the
wonderlic
test
by
vast
disproportions
screens
out
black
people
for
the
very
same
reason
that
high
school
education
requirement
does.
it
is
really
a
test
of
the
capacity
to
do
the
kind
of
thing
a
high
school
graduate
may
be
able
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
an
industrial
problem,
i
would
suggest
they
might
be
depriving
themselves
of
people
otherwise
to
do
the
job
very
well.
but
that
would
not
be
the
problem
that
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no
violation
problem.
if
it
has
a
disproportion
impact
upon
black
people
or
members
of
some
of
the
various
protected
groups
then
they
can
use
it
if
they
can
justify
it
in
terms
of
business
necessity.
but
if
these
tests
of
july
2,
1965
screens
out
blacks
and
high
school
education
requirements
screens
them
out
and
they
--
it
has
no
bearing
on
who
can
and
cannot
do
the
job
then
it's
our
position
and
may
not
refuse
it.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
get
to
the
record
in
this
case
because
i
would
like
to
assert
to
this
court
that
this
record
nowhere
demonstrates
that
this
high
--
the
high
school
education
or
the
ability
to
pass
the
test
is
related
to
any
job
that
is
from
labor
to
coal
handler
or
from
coal
handler
to
anywhere
else.
that's
saying
that
in
some
plants,
somewhere
and
some
records,
someone
might
not
demonstrate
that
and
if
they
did,
it
would
be
a
different
case.
it
is
not
demonstrated
here
and
i'd
like
to
read
this,
“but
two
of
many
proportions
of
the
record
that
indicate
that
the
contrary
is
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i'm
going
to
read
from
page
179,
dr.
moffie,
the
respondent's
industrial
psychologist
and
he
said
the
same
the
number
of
times.
but
here
he
said,
“they're
trying
to
validate
each
job.
we
are
doing
job
related
validities.
for
example,
we
have
completed
one
study
where
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
right.
we
have
completed
one
study.
we
had
taken
over
roughly
100
to
200
people
in
some
categories.
well,
over
200
people
of
different
job
levels
where
we
have
attempted
to
validate
the
wonderlic.
and
we
are
finding
as
pointed
out
this
morning
by
dr.
barron.
dr.
barron
is
the
petitioner's
expert
that
we
are
too
broad.
you
can
find
that
throughout
the
record.
now
as
to
the
high
school
education
on
page
188
and
of
course
this
is
redundant
because
the
test
in
this
case
is
meant
to
demonstrate
whether
they
are
average
high
school
graduate
and
so
it
is
redundant
but
in
any
event,
dr.
moffie
says,
“high
school
education
would
merely
tell
you
that
you
have
the
necessary
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
188,
just
above
the
colloquy
on
the
bottom
of
the
page.
mr.
jack
greenberg
high
school
education
would
merely
tell
you
that
you
have
necessary
abilities
as
defined
by
a
high
school
education
and
if
the
company
feels
that
this
is
required
in
this
job
that's
all
that
would
tell
you.
that's
what
respondents
in
the
amicus
is
saying
that
if
the
company
feels
that
you
ought
to
have
this
qualifications
then
the
company
ought
to
have
the
right
to
do
it
and
--
but
that's
not
what
the
statute
says.
the
statute
changes
the
pre-existing
situation
and
says
its
unlawful
employment
practice
for
an
employer
too.
and
i'll
just
summarize
here,
classify
employees
in
any
way
which
would
deprive
or
tend
to
deprive
any
individual
employment
opportunities
or
otherwise
adversely
affect
the
status.
and
the
statute
says
you
may
not
classify
them.
they
have
classified
them
by
ability
to
take
the
tests
and
have
a
high
school
education
and
it
deprives
and
certainly
tends
to
deprive
them
and
adversely
affects
them
with
respect
to
employment
and
promotion
and
pay.
and
we
submit
that's
a
violation
of
the
statute.
now
there
is
an
exception
in
this
statute
that
was
referred
to.
section
703
(h)
which
is
the
professionally
developed
ability
test
provision
and
that
comes
out
of
the
motorola
case
which
was
referred
to.
the
motorola
case
was
a
case
quite
unlike
this
case.
motorola
and
this
case
are
not
the
same
cases
at
all.
motorola
was
a
case
in
which
a
hearing
examiner
held
that
even
though
a
negro
applicant
for
a
job
could
not
pass
a
test
and
could
not
do
the
job,
he
nevertheless
ought
to
be
employed
with
some
notion
of
compensatory
employment,
compensatory
credit
for
being
deprive
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
and
that's
not
this
case
and
that's
not
this
statute.
if
these
petitioners
were
taking
a
job
validated,
job
related
tests
and
they
could
not
pass
the
tests
and
not
passing
the
tests
indicated
they
could
not
do
the
job,
we
would
not
be
here
today.
but
these
are
tests
which
the
respondents
have
considered
throughout
the
record
do
not
indicate
anything
at
all
about
the
ability
to
do
job.
non-high
school
graduates
are
in
coal
handling,
maintenance,
laboratory
and
test,
operations.
they
are
being
promoted
at
the
same
--
approximately
as
the
calculations
in
the
government's
brief
indicates
and
promoted
at
the
same
rate
as
high
school
graduates,
they
are
earning
approximately
the
same
pay
as
high
school
graduates
and
the
argument
that
they
have
to
be
able
to
pass
these
tests
go
from
labor
to
coal
handling
so
that
that
they
then
can
reach
some
very
much
higher
lever
at
the
plant.
it's
just
not
born
out
in
addition
to
which
i
mean
just
to
look
at
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
then
we
would
have
a
different
case.
if
it
were
shown
that
this
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
if
it
were
shown
that
these
were
a
place
--
a
plant
with
rapid
and
frequent
promotion
which
is
not
true
here,
the
place
is
stagnant,
it
were
stable
as
the
call
it.
mr.
jack
greenberg
if
promotions
were
from
inside
and
it
were
necessary
to
--
and
the
company
can
demonstrate
that
blocking
up
the
lines
of
progression
would
adversely
affect
the
operation
of
the
plant.
we
would
not
be
urging
the
position,
our
position
with
respect
to
that
situation.
in
other
words,
it
would
be
job
related.
it
would
be
job
validated
but
in
some
other
sense
with
regard
to
promotability.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
right,
it's
not
--
i
mean
you
can
divide
the
job
validation
issue
into
two
parts.
the
job
validation
as
respect
to
medium
employment
and
future
employment
over
some
period
of
time
and
that
second
category
is
not
quite
as
simple
because
i
think
the
company
might
have
to
demonstrate
that
there
is
a
regular
flow
of
people
through
the
plant
and
if
they
can't
function
with
people
stopping
of
somewhere
along
the
way
up
the
ladder.
but
nevertheless,
if
the
could
show
that
and
they
could
show
that
it
would
interfere
with
their
functioning
properly
to
have
people
sort
of
stop
in
the
line
of
progression
not
to
conform
in
and
supervise
this
and
so
forth,
then
they
would
have
establish
a
current
of
job
validation.
but
they
haven't
even
done
that
here.
they
just
made
an
assertion
about
it.
and
that's
not
adequate
to
divest
the
petitioners
of
their
rights,
we
would
submit.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
would
say
that
would
be
enough
--
not
enough
when
you're
dealing
in
an
area
like
this
where
without
speaking
about
any
particular
case,
there's
a
lot
of
duplicity
going
on
and
a
lot
of
cases.
you
have
to
have
something
you
can
deal
with
objectively
but
quite
a
part
from
that,
we
have
non-high
school
graduates
across
the
total
range
of
employment
in
these
plants,
so
it
just
really
doesn't
hold
the
water.
just
a
final
word
about
703
(h),
we
submit
that
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
which
is
charge
by
the
statute
with
the
enforcement
of
the
statute
is
in
a
particular
peculiar
--
peculiarly
advantageous
position
to
construe
it
and
it
has
construed
the
term
professionally
developed
ability
test
to
mean
a
job
validated
test.
so
far
as
the
legislative
history
is
concerned,
briefs
are
full
of
it.
we
think
that
the
conclusion
of
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
should
be
dispositive.
we
think
that
we
have
demonstrated
quite
clearly
in
the
brief
of
legislative
history
indicates
that
one
ought
to
be
able
to
pass
a
test
which
indicates
his
ability
to
do
a
job
not
just
to
pass
a
test
in
the
abstract
which
doesn't
indicate
anything
at
all.
mr.
chief
justice
you
asked
the
question
about
the
ability
to
speak
spanish.
there
was
a
case
quite
like
that
which
was
settled
that
that
was
against
one
of
the
southwestern
power
companies
but
involved
height.
in
order
to
be
a
lineman,
you
had
to
be
above
a
certain
height
and
for
variety
of
reasons,
mexican
americans
in
that
part
of
the
county
were
not
above
the
certain
height,
generally
speaking
and
they
could
not
get
the
job.
yet
there
was
no
indication
that
height
had
anything
at
all
to
do
with
the
ability
to
do
the
job.
proceeding
was
brought
and
the
case
was
settled
but
it
never
came
to
a
decision.
but
we
would
submit
that
if
one
could
show
that
this
was
a
height
test
and
that
only
one-third
as
many
black
people
qualified
for
the
height
test
as
white
people
and
that
height
had
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
ability
to
do
the
job,
we've
exactly
this
case
here
and
that
the
result
should
be
the
same.
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
not
a
subject
of
which
i
know
anything
at
all
but
it
would
seem
to
me
that
a
medical
education
is
really
is
ought
to
be
directly
related
to
the
ability
to
practice
medicine
and
once
the
excellence
of
one's
training
and
what
one
has
learned
has
demonstrated
by
his
record
would
bear
some
relation.
i
would
assume
that's
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
would
assume
that
relevant
criteria
would
be
used
and
that
would
be
job
validated.
i
would
think
that
it
make
sense
to
me.
i
can't
imagine
why
it
wouldn't
but
it's
not
--
it's
anything
i
really
know
anything
about.
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
which
affirmed
in
court
and
reversed
in
court
a
decision
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
middle
district
of
north
carolina
by
decision
in
which
judge
sobeloff
dissented.
the
issue
is
one
of
statutory
construction
of
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
and
the
particular
statutory
provision
for
which
i
would
like
to
draw
the
court's
attention
appears
on
page
2
of
our
brief.
the
statute
makes
it
unlawful
employment
practice
for
an
employer
to
fail
or
refuse
to
hire
or
to
discharge
any
individual
or
otherwise
to
discriminate
against
him
with
regard
to
race.
and
then
in
section
2
which
more
particularly
applies
to
the
issue
we
have
pending
here
to
limit,
segregate,
or
classify
his
employees
in
any
way
which
would
deprive
or
tend
to
deprive
any
individual
of
employment
opportunity
or
otherwise
adversely
affect
the
status
as
an
employee
because
of
race
and
other
forbidden
reasons.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
intelligence
tests
and
a
high
school
graduation
requirement
may
be
use
as
a
pre-requisite
to
promotion
from
the
job
of
laborer
to
the
job
of
coal-handler
and
perhaps
other
jobs
at
respondent's
power
plant.
when
these
tests,
that
is
the
intelligence
tests
which
i
might
say
was
adopted
on
july
2,
1965,
the
effective
date
of
the
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
when
these
tests
screen
out
negroes
at
a
significantly
higher
rate
than
they
screen
out
whites
and
there
has
been
no
demonstration
that
the
tests
and
the
high
school
requirement
predict
ability
to
do
the
job
and
indeed
there
is
some
evidence
to
the
contrary
that
they
do
not
predict
the
ability
to
do
the
job.
now,
the
court
below
held
in
the
case
of
employees
employed
after
the
high
school
requirement
was
instituted
that
the
statute
was
not
violated
and
as
i
read
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
and
the
position
of
respondents,
they
rests
on
three
separate
grounds,
that
first
of
all
that
there
was
no
demonstration
of
an
intent
to
discriminate.
secondly,
there's
a
statutory
argument
and
that
is
that
such
tests
are
privileged
as
“professionally
developed
ability
tests”
under
section
703
(h)
of
title
vii
and
then
there
is
an
assertion
by
the
respondent
which
we
say
has
no
support
in
the
record.
in
fact,
the
record
in
some
parts
of
the
country
that
the
test
survey
legitimate
business
need
that
is
that
certain
employees
are
not
fully
promotable
throughout
the
plant
to
higher
positions
and
that
the
high
school
education
requirements
help
select
employees
who
are.
now,
before
elaborating
our
argument,
we
would
like
to
make
our
position
clear
with
regard
to
ability
testing.
no
employer,
we
submit
under
the
statute
is
required
to
employ
anyone
who
is
unable
to
do
the
job
and
any
employer
may
use
tests
and
educational
requirements
which
predict
whether
an
employee
or
perspective
employee
can
do
the
job.
but
if
the
tests
that's
used
or
the
educational
requirement
that's
used
screens
out
members
of
a
race
or
of
a
group
protected
by
the
statute
and
does
not
predict
who
can
do
the
job
or
does
not
have
predictive
validity
as
the
industrial
psychologist
use
the
terminus
this
record
use
the
term,
then
it
cannot
be
justified
merely
on
the
basis
of
good
faith.
a
good
faith
or
intent,
we
submit
is
an
elusive
concept
which
regularly,
frequently
is
advance
in
civil
rights
cases.
we
hear
good
faith
defenses
in
school
segregation
cases,
in
jury
discrimination
cases,
in
voting
discrimination
cases
and
the
courts
have
regularly
responded
that
they
look
to
results
and
not
make
an
effort
to
read
the
mind
of
an
employer
or
indeed
something
much
more
difficult
to
do
to
read
the
mind
of
a
corporation
as
to
what
it
intends
to
do
by
the
application
of
certain
standards
and
tests.
indeed,
while
it
has
not
been
possible
on
this
record
to
challenge
the
good
faith
of
the
respondent
because
that's
just
something
that
one
can
very
rarely
develop
evidence
on.
such
a
test
would
be
an
invitation
to
many
who
would
seek
to
evade
the
statute
to
hide
behind
the
concept
of
good
faith.
now
as
i
said
duke
power
company
adopted
the
test
requirement
for
initial
employment
on
july
2,
1965
the
date
of
the
act
in
question.
until
then
and
until
after
the
filing
of
the
charge
in
this
case
in
fact,
employment
of
duke
power
company
was
rigidly
racially
segregated.
black
persons
worked
in
the
labor
department
only.
white
persons
worked
in
the
better
and
higher
paying
jobs,
that
is
the
departments
described
in
the
record
of
operations,
maintenance,
test
and
laboratory,
and
coal
handling.
and
the
highest
paid
black
worker
made
less
money
than
the
lowest
paid
white
worker
under
the
system.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
well,
at
one
time
(voice
overlap)
there
was
a
white
foreman
in
the
labor
department.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
first
formulation
is
the
correct
one.
there
was
rigid
racial
segregation.
the
labor
was
all
black,
everything
else
was
all
white.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
indeed
until
up
until
after
the
filing
of
the
charge
in
this
case
that's
some
time
after
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
think
the
first
black
men
probably
got
out
of
the
labor
department
in
1966,
after
the
filing
of
the
charge
before
the
employment
opportunity.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
is
correct.
there
is
no
question
about
that
on
the
record.
i
don't
think
the
respondent
would
challenge
that
for
a
moment.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
the
intelligence
test
was
put
in
at
the
request
of
certain
non-high
school
graduate
white
workers
in
the
coal
handling
department
as
a
substitute
for
a
high
school
education
and
it
has
been
described
in
the
record
as
a
test
which
would
identify
the
average
high
school
graduate.
so,
it's
perhaps
even
somewhat
more
stringent
in
the
high
school
education
requirement
in
that
that
half
the
high
school
graduates
presumably
would
be
unable
to
pass
these
tests.
and
to
enable
them
to
be
promoted
to
the
so-called
inside
departments,
labor
and
coal
handling
were
outside
only
the
departments
or
inside.
the
high
school
education
requirement
was
adopted
considerably
earlier
and
the
date
is
not
certain
but
it
appears
to
be
people
talk
in
terms
of
about
1955
as
a
pre-requisite
to
employment
and
promotion
in
all
departments
but
the
labor
department.
black
people
can
be
employed
in
labor
without
a
high
school
education.
others
could
be
employed
in
the
other
departments
initially
only
with
a
high
school
education.
but
many
pre-1955
duke
power
employees
are
non-high
school
graduates
at
all
pay
levels
throughout
the
plant
and
indeed,
the
--
our
brief
has
an
analysis
of
the
pay
which
is
earned
by
various
workers.
the
pay
earned
by
an
average
high
school
work
or
an
average
non-high
school
worker
is
about
the
same
the
calculations
are
on
page
38
of
our
brief
and
the
government's
brief
engages
in
a
similar
analysis
of
promotability
comparable
promotability
and
promotion
rates
of
high
school
and
non-high
school
graduates
and
it
finds
that
high
school
and
non-high
school
graduates
within
the
plant
are
roughly
promoted
and
approximately
the
same
rate.
mr.
jack
greenberg
there
--
to
quote
the
respondents
in
this
case
and
i
am
sure
this
is
right.
there
is
“a
real
stable
employment
situation
there
and
there
have
been
roughly
about
95
workers
at
all
times
that
are
relevant
to
this
case.”
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
industry.
it
just
may
be
that
in
the
power
industry,
it's
possible
to
expand
power
production
perhaps
from
other
locations
without
increasing
the
work
force
but
the
employment
situation
has
remained
just
about
the
same.
i
think
that
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
real
doubt
about
that
and
they
characterize
it
as
stable,
and
it
apparently
is.
after
the
passage
of
the
act
and
they
filed
into
complaint
before
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission,
duke
did
promote
a
number
of
black
workers
with
a
high
school
education
over
a
period
of
a
couple
of
years.
and
the
court
of
appeals
then
ordered
the
promotability
but
not
the
actual
promotion
of
others
employed
before
the
high
school
education
requirement
was
adopted
and
that
is
now
in
further
litigation
down
in
the
district
court
because
there
is
a
claim
at
which
the
court
has
not
yet
rendered
any
position
that
some
white
people
have
been
brought
above
this
black
workers.
the
court
has
not
resolved
that.
this
case
involves
four
workers
frozen
in
the
labor
department
by
the
test
requirement
of
july
2,
1965
and
by
the
fact
that
they
have
no
high
school
education.
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
record
is
not
clear
on
who
has
taken
and
who
has
not
taken
these
tests.
the
record
indicates
that
three
of
the
workers,
some
of
them
black
and
some
of
them
white,
we
don't
know
which
to
a
black
which
one
is
white.
half
taken
and
failed
the
test.
everyone
who
has
taken
the
test
has
failed
it.
the
record
indicates
that
applicants
for
employment
almost
entirely
the
overwhelming
number
of
the
client
to
take
the
test.
they
don't
want
to
take
the
test.
this
is
however
class
action
and
our
argument
about
the
test
is
that
it
is
so
patently
discriminatory
as
i
hope
to
develop
in
the
moment
too
that
really
doesn't
matter,
that
doesn't
have
any
real
bearing
on
the
decision
of
the
case.
mr.
jack
greenberg
these
are
four
identifiable
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
class
in
the
complaint
and
in
the
order
allowing
an
amendment
to
the
complaint
is
defined
as
persons
presently
working
at
duke
power
and
those
who
may
be
accepted
for
employment
in
the
future.
so
it
is
in
some
sense
a
rather
well-defined
class
than
in
the
sense
quite
an
open-ended
class.
mr.
jack
greenberg
oh!
yes,
the
district
court
right
on
pages
17
of
the
complaint
files
an
order
allowing
amendment
to
the
complaint
and
defines
it.
well,
then
on
page
19
also,
it's
the
same
thing
again
order
allowing
class
action.
this
action
is
maintainable
as
a
class
action.
only
in
so
far
as
six
injunctive
reliefs
and
so
from
the
class
presented
are
those
represent
--
are
those
negroes
presently
employed
as
well
as
those
who
make
subsequently
be
employed
by
defendant
standard
of
the
station.
both
those
orders
on
page
17
and
19
(a)
may
be
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
that's
not
future
applicants,
those
who
may
subsequently
be
employed.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i'm
sorry,
and
then
on
page
14,
its
also
who
may
subsequently
seek
employment
by
defendant
on
page
14
order
allowing
amendment
to
the
complaint.
so
it's
both.
mr.
jack
greenberg
14
(a)
order
allowing
amendment
to
the
complaint.
mr.
jack
greenberg
who
are
now
employed
that
may
subsequently
seek
employment,
the
first
paragraph,
the
order
line.
and
then
the
opinion
of
the
court
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
we
do
not
know
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
is
correct.
mr.
jack
greenberg
everybody
who's
taken
the
tests
has
failed.
mr.
jack
greenberg
if
--
we
do
not
know.
we
do
not
know.
i
might
then
point
out
the
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
defines
the
class
as
those
who
subsequently
maybe
employed
and
may
hereafter
seek
employment.
that's
in
the
very
sentence
of
judge
forman's
opinion.
as
i
was
saying,
the
case
involves
those
workers
who
want
to
be
promoted
from
labor
to
coal
handling.
now
white
men
without
a
high
school
education
who
have
not
passed
the
tests
and
who
do
not
have
a
high
school
education
are
doing
the
coal
handling
jobs
today.
typically,
the
way
workers
qualify
for
the
coal
handling
job
is
by
on
the
job
training
on
page
124
of
the
larger
volume
of
the
record.
official
of
the
company
testifies.
we
would
have
to
determine
that
by
action
or
actually
putting
them
in
if
there
was
an
opening
to
see
how
they
would
perform.
and
then
he
says,
you
would
take
the
scene,
the
man
if
he
is
qualified
to
go
into
job
and
make
a
trial
of
him
and
try
him
out.
and
then
the
method
of
qualifying
the
job
is
elaborated
also
on
page
23
as
in
response
to
interrogatory
27.
the
company
provides
on-the-job-training.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
the
record
shows
that
there
is
a,
there
is
a
document
filed
by
the
respondents
which
the
education
of
everyone
who
on
page
126
of
this
record
of
everyone
who
works
in
the
plant
by
my
rough
calculation
about
a
third
of
the
people
in
the
plant
do
not
have
a
--
are
not
high
school
graduates.
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
there
is
some
statement
by
respondents
that
elsewhere
in
the
utility
industry
tests
of
this
sort
are
being
used.
but
i
would
like
to
say
that
there
is
first
of
all,
there
is
no
demonstration
to
perform
the
job
of
coal
handler,
you
have
to
have
a
high
school
education.
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
the
labor's
jobs,
the
labor's
jobs
and
the
coal
handler's
jobs,
job
specifications
are
here
in
pages
48
and
65
of
the
record
and
they're
roughly
the
same.
the
coal
handler
just
to
read
a
few
of
them
has
to
operate
certain
vehicle
service
and
clean
coal
handling
equipment
and
be
able
to
record
weight
on
page
48.
on
page
65,
the
labor
has
to
operated
company
vehicles,
operate
floor
sweeping
machines,
tractors,
trucks
and
so
forth,
lift
trucks
and
so
forth.
things
are
comparable.
the
jobs
are
--
people
are
trained
for
the
job,
by
on-the-job
training.
there
is
no
indication
that
the
high
school
education
in
any
way
qualifies
want
to
do
the
job.
and
indeed
if
one
were
to
look
at
the
wonderlic
tests
which
appears
here
on
page
102
of
the
record,
it's
difficult
to
see
how
for
the
qualifications
put
now
for
coal
handler
there
is
any
need
to
know
or
even
have
a
sense
of
the
difference
between
the
words
adopt
and
adept,
reflect
--
reflect
and
reflex,
pretensions
and
pretentious,
image
and
imaginary,
enlarge
and
aggrandize,
and
various
other
kinds
of
test.
mr.
jack
greenberg
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
that
it
would
at
all.
we
do
not
deny
that
there
are
jobs
which
that
kind
of
a
test
or
some
kind
of
a
test
might
have
some
validity.
the
wonderlic
people
who
prepared
the
tests
themselves
say
the
test
is
not
useful
unless
it
has
been
--
unless
it
has
what
they
call
predict
the
validity,
you
have
to
see
whether
or
not
passing
these
tests
qualifies
you
to
do
this
job.
this
test
is
not
an
open
sesame
to
decide
who
can
do
any
job
in
the
whole
world.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
would
not
be
a
violation
of
the
job
if
he
could
demonstrate
that
that
kind
of
capacity
to
be
promotable
is
necessary
to
do
the
job
and
necessary
for
the
operation
if
it
is
planned.
and
then
it
might
not
be
a
violation
either
if
he
did
not
disproportionately
screen
out
members
of
a
protected
race
or
national
group
or
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
the
key.
there
is
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
then
it
must
be
justified
in
terms
of
some
sort
of
validation
of
its
ability
to
predict
and
here
we
have
in
the
state
of
north
carolina,
one-third
as
many
black
people
as
white
people
graduate
from
high
school.
examinations
of
this
wonderlic
test
by
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
and
now
recently
in
the
case
in
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana,
hicks
against
crown-zellerbach
show
that
the
wonderlic
test
by
vast
disproportions
screens
out
black
people
for
the
very
same
reason
that
high
school
education
requirement
does.
it
is
really
a
test
of
the
capacity
to
do
the
kind
of
thing
a
high
school
graduate
may
be
able
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
an
industrial
problem,
i
would
suggest
they
might
be
depriving
themselves
of
people
otherwise
to
do
the
job
very
well.
but
that
would
not
be
the
problem
that
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no
violation
problem.
if
it
has
a
disproportion
impact
upon
black
people
or
members
of
some
of
the
various
protected
groups
then
they
can
use
it
if
they
can
justify
it
in
terms
of
business
necessity.
but
if
these
tests
of
july
2,
1965
screens
out
blacks
and
high
school
education
requirements
screens
them
out
and
they
--
it
has
no
bearing
on
who
can
and
cannot
do
the
job
then
it's
our
position
and
may
not
refuse
it.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
get
to
the
record
in
this
case
because
i
would
like
to
assert
to
this
court
that
this
record
nowhere
demonstrates
that
this
high
--
the
high
school
education
or
the
ability
to
pass
the
test
is
related
to
any
job
that
is
from
labor
to
coal
handler
or
from
coal
handler
to
anywhere
else.
that's
saying
that
in
some
plants,
somewhere
and
some
records,
someone
might
not
demonstrate
that
and
if
they
did,
it
would
be
a
different
case.
it
is
not
demonstrated
here
and
i'd
like
to
read
this,
“but
two
of
many
proportions
of
the
record
that
indicate
that
the
contrary
is
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i'm
going
to
read
from
page
179,
dr.
moffie,
the
respondent's
industrial
psychologist
and
he
said
the
same
the
number
of
times.
but
here
he
said,
“they're
trying
to
validate
each
job.
we
are
doing
job
related
validities.
for
example,
we
have
completed
one
study
where
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
right.
we
have
completed
one
study.
we
had
taken
over
roughly
100
to
200
people
in
some
categories.
well,
over
200
people
of
different
job
levels
where
we
have
attempted
to
validate
the
wonderlic.
and
we
are
finding
as
pointed
out
this
morning
by
dr.
barron.
dr.
barron
is
the
petitioner's
expert
that
we
are
too
broad.
you
can
find
that
throughout
the
record.
now
as
to
the
high
school
education
on
page
188
and
of
course
this
is
redundant
because
the
test
in
this
case
is
meant
to
demonstrate
whether
they
are
average
high
school
graduate
and
so
it
is
redundant
but
in
any
event,
dr.
moffie
says,
“high
school
education
would
merely
tell
you
that
you
have
the
necessary
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
188,
just
above
the
colloquy
on
the
bottom
of
the
page.
mr.
jack
greenberg
high
school
education
would
merely
tell
you
that
you
have
necessary
abilities
as
defined
by
a
high
school
education
and
if
the
company
feels
that
this
is
required
in
this
job
that's
all
that
would
tell
you.
that's
what
respondents
in
the
amicus
is
saying
that
if
the
company
feels
that
you
ought
to
have
this
qualifications
then
the
company
ought
to
have
the
right
to
do
it
and
--
but
that's
not
what
the
statute
says.
the
statute
changes
the
pre-existing
situation
and
says
its
unlawful
employment
practice
for
an
employer
too.
and
i'll
just
summarize
here,
classify
employees
in
any
way
which
would
deprive
or
tend
to
deprive
any
individual
employment
opportunities
or
otherwise
adversely
affect
the
status.
and
the
statute
says
you
may
not
classify
them.
they
have
classified
them
by
ability
to
take
the
tests
and
have
a
high
school
education
and
it
deprives
and
certainly
tends
to
deprive
them
and
adversely
affects
them
with
respect
to
employment
and
promotion
and
pay.
and
we
submit
that's
a
violation
of
the
statute.
now
there
is
an
exception
in
this
statute
that
was
referred
to.
section
703
(h)
which
is
the
professionally
developed
ability
test
provision
and
that
comes
out
of
the
motorola
case
which
was
referred
to.
the
motorola
case
was
a
case
quite
unlike
this
case.
motorola
and
this
case
are
not
the
same
cases
at
all.
motorola
was
a
case
in
which
a
hearing
examiner
held
that
even
though
a
negro
applicant
for
a
job
could
not
pass
a
test
and
could
not
do
the
job,
he
nevertheless
ought
to
be
employed
with
some
notion
of
compensatory
employment,
compensatory
credit
for
being
deprive
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
and
that's
not
this
case
and
that's
not
this
statute.
if
these
petitioners
were
taking
a
job
validated,
job
related
tests
and
they
could
not
pass
the
tests
and
not
passing
the
tests
indicated
they
could
not
do
the
job,
we
would
not
be
here
today.
but
these
are
tests
which
the
respondents
have
considered
throughout
the
record
do
not
indicate
anything
at
all
about
the
ability
to
do
job.
non-high
school
graduates
are
in
coal
handling,
maintenance,
laboratory
and
test,
operations.
they
are
being
promoted
at
the
same
--
approximately
as
the
calculations
in
the
government's
brief
indicates
and
promoted
at
the
same
rate
as
high
school
graduates,
they
are
earning
approximately
the
same
pay
as
high
school
graduates
and
the
argument
that
they
have
to
be
able
to
pass
these
tests
go
from
labor
to
coal
handling
so
that
that
they
then
can
reach
some
very
much
higher
lever
at
the
plant.
it's
just
not
born
out
in
addition
to
which
i
mean
just
to
look
at
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
then
we
would
have
a
different
case.
if
it
were
shown
that
this
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
if
it
were
shown
that
these
were
a
place
--
a
plant
with
rapid
and
frequent
promotion
which
is
not
true
here,
the
place
is
stagnant,
it
were
stable
as
the
call
it.
mr.
jack
greenberg
if
promotions
were
from
inside
and
it
were
necessary
to
--
and
the
company
can
demonstrate
that
blocking
up
the
lines
of
progression
would
adversely
affect
the
operation
of
the
plant.
we
would
not
be
urging
the
position,
our
position
with
respect
to
that
situation.
in
other
words,
it
would
be
job
related.
it
would
be
job
validated
but
in
some
other
sense
with
regard
to
promotability.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
right,
it's
not
--
i
mean
you
can
divide
the
job
validation
issue
into
two
parts.
the
job
validation
as
respect
to
medium
employment
and
future
employment
over
some
period
of
time
and
that
second
category
is
not
quite
as
simple
because
i
think
the
company
might
have
to
demonstrate
that
there
is
a
regular
flow
of
people
through
the
plant
and
if
they
can't
function
with
people
stopping
of
somewhere
along
the
way
up
the
ladder.
but
nevertheless,
if
the
could
show
that
and
they
could
show
that
it
would
interfere
with
their
functioning
properly
to
have
people
sort
of
stop
in
the
line
of
progression
not
to
conform
in
and
supervise
this
and
so
forth,
then
they
would
have
establish
a
current
of
job
validation.
but
they
haven't
even
done
that
here.
they
just
made
an
assertion
about
it.
and
that's
not
adequate
to
divest
the
petitioners
of
their
rights,
we
would
submit.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
would
say
that
would
be
enough
--
not
enough
when
you're
dealing
in
an
area
like
this
where
without
speaking
about
any
particular
case,
there's
a
lot
of
duplicity
going
on
and
a
lot
of
cases.
you
have
to
have
something
you
can
deal
with
objectively
but
quite
a
part
from
that,
we
have
non-high
school
graduates
across
the
total
range
of
employment
in
these
plants,
so
it
just
really
doesn't
hold
the
water.
just
a
final
word
about
703
(h),
we
submit
that
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
which
is
charge
by
the
statute
with
the
enforcement
of
the
statute
is
in
a
particular
peculiar
--
peculiarly
advantageous
position
to
construe
it
and
it
has
construed
the
term
professionally
developed
ability
test
to
mean
a
job
validated
test.
so
far
as
the
legislative
history
is
concerned,
briefs
are
full
of
it.
we
think
that
the
conclusion
of
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
should
be
dispositive.
we
think
that
we
have
demonstrated
quite
clearly
in
the
brief
of
legislative
history
indicates
that
one
ought
to
be
able
to
pass
a
test
which
indicates
his
ability
to
do
a
job
not
just
to
pass
a
test
in
the
abstract
which
doesn't
indicate
anything
at
all.
mr.
chief
justice
you
asked
the
question
about
the
ability
to
speak
spanish.
there
was
a
case
quite
like
that
which
was
settled
that
that
was
against
one
of
the
southwestern
power
companies
but
involved
height.
in
order
to
be
a
lineman,
you
had
to
be
above
a
certain
height
and
for
variety
of
reasons,
mexican
americans
in
that
part
of
the
county
were
not
above
the
certain
height,
generally
speaking
and
they
could
not
get
the
job.
yet
there
was
no
indication
that
height
had
anything
at
all
to
do
with
the
ability
to
do
the
job.
proceeding
was
brought
and
the
case
was
settled
but
it
never
came
to
a
decision.
but
we
would
submit
that
if
one
could
show
that
this
was
a
height
test
and
that
only
one-third
as
many
black
people
qualified
for
the
height
test
as
white
people
and
that
height
had
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
ability
to
do
the
job,
we've
exactly
this
case
here
and
that
the
result
should
be
the
same.
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
not
a
subject
of
which
i
know
anything
at
all
but
it
would
seem
to
me
that
a
medical
education
is
really
is
ought
to
be
directly
related
to
the
ability
to
practice
medicine
and
once
the
excellence
of
one's
training
and
what
one
has
learned
has
demonstrated
by
his
record
would
bear
some
relation.
i
would
assume
that's
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
would
assume
that
relevant
criteria
would
be
used
and
that
would
be
job
validated.
i
would
think
that
it
make
sense
to
me.
i
can't
imagine
why
it
wouldn't
but
it's
not
--
it's
anything
i
really
know
anything
about.
