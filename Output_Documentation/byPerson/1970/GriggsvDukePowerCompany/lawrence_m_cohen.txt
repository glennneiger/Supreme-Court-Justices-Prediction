mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
before
you
today
in
behalf
of
the
chamber
of
commerce
of
the
united
states
to
urge
affirmance
of
the
decision
below.
this
case
is
one
which
is
a
vital
concern
to
employers,
both
small
and
large
throughout
the
united
states.
in
today's
labor
market,
there
are
often
many
applicants
for
the
job,
just
as
there
are
many
employees
who
desire
to
be
promoted
into
a
better
position.
the
employer
must
make
a
choice
and
the
choice
confine
the
employers
often
a
difficult
one.
we
believe
employers
must
be
permitted
to
be
able
to
use
objective,
generally
accepted
standards
of
intelligence,
educational
achievement
or
ability
in
order
to
make
that
decision.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
think
this
is
really
the
heart
of
this
case.
most
educational
test
today
unfortunately
or
aptitude
test
have
a
discriminatory
impact
on
one
and
more
racial
groups.
this
is
the
educ
problem
of
the
social
economic
status
of
these
groups
as
it
historically
evolved.
we
would
--
the
position
that
petitioner's
urge
says
that
wherever
you
have
an
educational
requirement,
wherever
you
have
an
intelligence
test,
the
employers
then
are
obligated
to
prove
business
necessity
that
he
had
to
use
that
particular
tests.
we
believe
that
where
the
employer
has
a
legitimate
business
purpose
and
can
demonstrate
to
the
court
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
in
the
case
that
he
had
a
legitimate
business
purpose
for
the
tests,
he
ought
to
be
permitted
to
use
it.
when
congress
enacted
title
vii,
it
knew
that
educational
requirements
and
tests
had
a
potential
discrimination
on
the
type
that
you've
just
referred
to.
it
did
not
allow
to
use
a
test.
they
did
not
prohibit
the
use
of
educational
requirements.
it
tried
to
reach
a
compromise
where
employers
could
use
such
test
and
use
such
educational
requirements
as
long
as
they
were
not
a
pretext
or
substitute
for
discrimination.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
well,
i
--
it's
--
it
isn't
--
it's
whether
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
in
the
case.
did
the
employer
use
or
intend
that
the
test
be
discriminatory?
that's
the
words
for
example
of
703
(h).
our
fear
here
really
is
that
if
a
business
necessity
test
is
adopted
of
the
type
that
petitioners
varies
to
this
court,
the
result
would
be
that
employers
won't
be
able
to
any
objective
test.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
no,
i
think
the
difference
is
between
business
necessity
which
is
the
position,
the
petitioners
and
the
government
urged
and
legitimate
business
purpose.
this
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
split
on
the
case.
in
the
majority
opinion,
the
court
says
the
respondent
had
a
legitimate
business
purpose
and
persist
the
details
some
six
or
seven
reasons
why
it
believes
that
there
had
a
legitimate
business
purpose.
it
approached
in
a
case
by
case
basis
and
on
the
based
of
the
entire
record.
judge
sobeloff
in
his
dissent
says
the
test
is
one
of
business
necessity.
and
that
in
turn
is
the
position
that
petitioners
urge
before
this
court
today.
the
problem
really
is
one
of
what
does
business
necessity
mean.
one
court
of
appeals
recently
held
that
business
necessity
means
that
essential
to
the
safe
and
efficient
operation
of
the
employers
business.
the
trouble
is
that
educational
requirements
or
tests
are
never
can
be
shown
to
be
essential.
so
the
test
is
essential.
the
employer
must
fall
back
and
use
something
other
than
objective
criteria
because
under
the
eeoc's
definition
of
a
test,
any
objective
means
selecting
employees
is
considered
a
test.
that's
really
what
we're
talking
about
today.
we're
not
talking
about
the
wonderlic
test.
we're
not
talking
about
the
bennett
test.
we're
talking
about
objective
means
of
choosing
which
employee
should
fit
in
to
a
particular
job
or
which
employee
should
be
hired
in
the
first
place.
and
if
the
employers
cannot
use
objective
means,
then
the
only
way
they
can
choose
employers
is
either
subjectively
who
does
the
interviewer
like,
or
on
the
basis
some
arbitrary
method
like
the
first
person
in
is
the
first
person
hired.
and
we
feel
and
that
the
court
noted
in
the
porter
case
that
if
you
use
subjective
or
arbitrary
means,
it
have
a
vastly
greater
potential
for
discrimination
and
a
vastly
greater
potential
for
poor
business
decisions
and
related
business
decision
than
a
test
in
the
objective
kind
of
criteria
which
the
duke
power
used
here.
and
our
fear
is
that
if
the
test
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
tests
served
the
legitimate
business
capacity
--
business
purpose
by
hiring
a
reservoir
of
able
employees
in
coal
handling
who
cannot
only
do
the
jobs
there
but
were
reasonably
able
to
be
promoted
into
the
higher
skill
jobs.
whether
on
the
--
i
would
feel
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
a
reasonable
one
here
and
that
should
not
be
disturbed.
but
the
real
--
my
real
point
here
is
that
the
test
has
to
be
one
that
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
marshall?
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
well,
i
think
the
difference
is
that
there's
greater
skills
required
of
the
employees
in
the
coal
handling
department.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that's
correct
but
the
question
is,
does
should
you
in
each
case
require
the
employer
before
he
uses
a
tests
to
first
demonstrate
that
that
test
is
related
just
to
that
particular
job?
or
can
you
hire
from,
have
a
test
that
relates
to
more
than
that
particular
job?
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
my
question
is
--
my
feeling
mr.
justice
marshall
is
that
this
is
like
a
case
of
an
employer
who
discharges
a
union
employee
during
a
union
organizational
campaign.
he
doesn't
have
a
right
to
discharge
if
he's
discharging
the
employee
because
he's
engaged
in
union
activities.
but
he
does
have
the
right
if
he
is
acting
within
for
a
legitimate
business
purpose
and
not
because
he
is
trying
to
get
up
the
employee
because
of
union
person.
if
someone
sets
up
a
standard
for
the
coal
handling
department
and
does
that
with
for
no
business
purpose
and
only
so
that
he
can
prohibit
negroes
from
entering
that
department
then
i
think
he
has
violated
this
law.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
the
company
put
in
the
--
the
policy
of
permitting
as
an
alternate
to
the
educational
requirement
of
permitting
test.
that
was
put
in
the
day
effective,
the
educational
requirement
itself
and
the
day
of
the
act
by
some
10
years.
now,
what
the
employer
did
when
the
act
became
effective
was
to
create
and
additionally
avenue
for
promotion
that
was
over
and
above
what
he
had
done
prior
to
the
act.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
right.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
what
--
yes,
i
think
that's
what
the
point
that
i
like
to
make
is
that,
i
think
what
the
court
of
appeals
needed
to
consider
was
often
is
the
timing
of
the
tests,
what
the
employers
racial
relation,
what
is
generally
action
was
in
the
area
of
race
relations,
what
kind
of
expert
opinion
her
relied
on.
what
he
did
later
on
is
back
his
engage
in
validation
studies
now.
it
was
on
the
basis
of
that
entire
record
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
to
make
a
decision
of
whether
there
was
a
legitimate
business
purpose.
the
same
way
the
court
of
appeals
i
say
would
have
considered
whether
the
employer
really
had
a
legitimate
business
purpose
in
discharging
a
union
employee.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
consider
all
these
facts.
it
waived
the
timing
as
you've
indicated
along
with
the
other
facts
on
the
record
and
it
reach
to
what
is
a
reasonable
decision
and
the
decision
that
i
think
this
court
ought
not
to
disturb.
my
principle
reason
here
appearing
is
an
amicus
is
not
so
much
to
argue
the
facts
of
whether
the
court's
decision
was
correct
or
whether
the
court
of
appeals
applied
the
correct
tests.
that
i
think
is
the
key
issue
in
this
case.
and
we
would
urge
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
apply
the
correct
tests.
where
they
reach
the
correct
result
applying
the
test
is
a
different
story.
well,
we
think
the
correct
test
should
be
one
as
the
court
of
appeals
did
of
whether
the
employer
and
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case
and
on
a
case
by
case
approach
adopted
a
--
had
a
legitimate
business
purpose
for
its
testing
requirement
or
for
its
educational
requirement.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
yes,
i
think
job
relationship
is
one
aspect
and
not
the
only
aspect
of
the
case.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
oh
absolutely!
but
it
should
not
be
determinative
either
under
the
eeoc's
guidelines
or
under
business
necessity
test.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
no,
i
would
--
my
feeling
is
you
can
never
prove
that
there
was
a
business
necessity
for
that
test
and
nor
that
it
was
job
related
in
the
sense
that
the
employers
had
to
have
that
skill
in
order
to
perform
the
job.
it
probably
would
not
--
if
it
had
not
as
i
understand
the
petitioner's
position,
if
it
had
not
been
validated
and
which
includes
job
relatedness.
under
the
eeoc's
guidelines,
the
employer
could
not
use
it.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
you
would
have
to
demonstrate
that
the
employers
could
not
do
the
job
if
they
did
not
have
an
understanding
of
english.
have
the
employer
--
that
an
understanding
of
english
was
essential
to
the
job.
the
employer
could
not
prove
those
two
points.
he
would
have
violated
the
law.
thank
you.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
before
you
today
in
behalf
of
the
chamber
of
commerce
of
the
united
states
to
urge
affirmance
of
the
decision
below.
this
case
is
one
which
is
a
vital
concern
to
employers,
both
small
and
large
throughout
the
united
states.
in
today's
labor
market,
there
are
often
many
applicants
for
the
job,
just
as
there
are
many
employees
who
desire
to
be
promoted
into
a
better
position.
the
employer
must
make
a
choice
and
the
choice
confine
the
employers
often
a
difficult
one.
we
believe
employers
must
be
permitted
to
be
able
to
use
objective,
generally
accepted
standards
of
intelligence,
educational
achievement
or
ability
in
order
to
make
that
decision.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
think
this
is
really
the
heart
of
this
case.
most
educational
test
today
unfortunately
or
aptitude
test
have
a
discriminatory
impact
on
one
and
more
racial
groups.
this
is
the
educ
problem
of
the
social
economic
status
of
these
groups
as
it
historically
evolved.
we
would
--
the
position
that
petitioner's
urge
says
that
wherever
you
have
an
educational
requirement,
wherever
you
have
an
intelligence
test,
the
employers
then
are
obligated
to
prove
business
necessity
that
he
had
to
use
that
particular
tests.
we
believe
that
where
the
employer
has
a
legitimate
business
purpose
and
can
demonstrate
to
the
court
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
in
the
case
that
he
had
a
legitimate
business
purpose
for
the
tests,
he
ought
to
be
permitted
to
use
it.
when
congress
enacted
title
vii,
it
knew
that
educational
requirements
and
tests
had
a
potential
discrimination
on
the
type
that
you've
just
referred
to.
it
did
not
allow
to
use
a
test.
they
did
not
prohibit
the
use
of
educational
requirements.
it
tried
to
reach
a
compromise
where
employers
could
use
such
test
and
use
such
educational
requirements
as
long
as
they
were
not
a
pretext
or
substitute
for
discrimination.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
well,
i
--
it's
--
it
isn't
--
it's
whether
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
in
the
case.
did
the
employer
use
or
intend
that
the
test
be
discriminatory?
that's
the
words
for
example
of
703
(h).
our
fear
here
really
is
that
if
a
business
necessity
test
is
adopted
of
the
type
that
petitioners
varies
to
this
court,
the
result
would
be
that
employers
won't
be
able
to
any
objective
test.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
no,
i
think
the
difference
is
between
business
necessity
which
is
the
position,
the
petitioners
and
the
government
urged
and
legitimate
business
purpose.
this
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
split
on
the
case.
in
the
majority
opinion,
the
court
says
the
respondent
had
a
legitimate
business
purpose
and
persist
the
details
some
six
or
seven
reasons
why
it
believes
that
there
had
a
legitimate
business
purpose.
it
approached
in
a
case
by
case
basis
and
on
the
based
of
the
entire
record.
judge
sobeloff
in
his
dissent
says
the
test
is
one
of
business
necessity.
and
that
in
turn
is
the
position
that
petitioners
urge
before
this
court
today.
the
problem
really
is
one
of
what
does
business
necessity
mean.
one
court
of
appeals
recently
held
that
business
necessity
means
that
essential
to
the
safe
and
efficient
operation
of
the
employers
business.
the
trouble
is
that
educational
requirements
or
tests
are
never
can
be
shown
to
be
essential.
so
the
test
is
essential.
the
employer
must
fall
back
and
use
something
other
than
objective
criteria
because
under
the
eeoc's
definition
of
a
test,
any
objective
means
selecting
employees
is
considered
a
test.
that's
really
what
we're
talking
about
today.
we're
not
talking
about
the
wonderlic
test.
we're
not
talking
about
the
bennett
test.
we're
talking
about
objective
means
of
choosing
which
employee
should
fit
in
to
a
particular
job
or
which
employee
should
be
hired
in
the
first
place.
and
if
the
employers
cannot
use
objective
means,
then
the
only
way
they
can
choose
employers
is
either
subjectively
who
does
the
interviewer
like,
or
on
the
basis
some
arbitrary
method
like
the
first
person
in
is
the
first
person
hired.
and
we
feel
and
that
the
court
noted
in
the
porter
case
that
if
you
use
subjective
or
arbitrary
means,
it
have
a
vastly
greater
potential
for
discrimination
and
a
vastly
greater
potential
for
poor
business
decisions
and
related
business
decision
than
a
test
in
the
objective
kind
of
criteria
which
the
duke
power
used
here.
and
our
fear
is
that
if
the
test
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
tests
served
the
legitimate
business
capacity
--
business
purpose
by
hiring
a
reservoir
of
able
employees
in
coal
handling
who
cannot
only
do
the
jobs
there
but
were
reasonably
able
to
be
promoted
into
the
higher
skill
jobs.
whether
on
the
--
i
would
feel
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
a
reasonable
one
here
and
that
should
not
be
disturbed.
but
the
real
--
my
real
point
here
is
that
the
test
has
to
be
one
that
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
marshall?
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
well,
i
think
the
difference
is
that
there's
greater
skills
required
of
the
employees
in
the
coal
handling
department.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that's
correct
but
the
question
is,
does
should
you
in
each
case
require
the
employer
before
he
uses
a
tests
to
first
demonstrate
that
that
test
is
related
just
to
that
particular
job?
or
can
you
hire
from,
have
a
test
that
relates
to
more
than
that
particular
job?
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
my
question
is
--
my
feeling
mr.
justice
marshall
is
that
this
is
like
a
case
of
an
employer
who
discharges
a
union
employee
during
a
union
organizational
campaign.
he
doesn't
have
a
right
to
discharge
if
he's
discharging
the
employee
because
he's
engaged
in
union
activities.
but
he
does
have
the
right
if
he
is
acting
within
for
a
legitimate
business
purpose
and
not
because
he
is
trying
to
get
up
the
employee
because
of
union
person.
if
someone
sets
up
a
standard
for
the
coal
handling
department
and
does
that
with
for
no
business
purpose
and
only
so
that
he
can
prohibit
negroes
from
entering
that
department
then
i
think
he
has
violated
this
law.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
the
company
put
in
the
--
the
policy
of
permitting
as
an
alternate
to
the
educational
requirement
of
permitting
test.
that
was
put
in
the
day
effective,
the
educational
requirement
itself
and
the
day
of
the
act
by
some
10
years.
now,
what
the
employer
did
when
the
act
became
effective
was
to
create
and
additionally
avenue
for
promotion
that
was
over
and
above
what
he
had
done
prior
to
the
act.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
right.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
what
--
yes,
i
think
that's
what
the
point
that
i
like
to
make
is
that,
i
think
what
the
court
of
appeals
needed
to
consider
was
often
is
the
timing
of
the
tests,
what
the
employers
racial
relation,
what
is
generally
action
was
in
the
area
of
race
relations,
what
kind
of
expert
opinion
her
relied
on.
what
he
did
later
on
is
back
his
engage
in
validation
studies
now.
it
was
on
the
basis
of
that
entire
record
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
to
make
a
decision
of
whether
there
was
a
legitimate
business
purpose.
the
same
way
the
court
of
appeals
i
say
would
have
considered
whether
the
employer
really
had
a
legitimate
business
purpose
in
discharging
a
union
employee.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
consider
all
these
facts.
it
waived
the
timing
as
you've
indicated
along
with
the
other
facts
on
the
record
and
it
reach
to
what
is
a
reasonable
decision
and
the
decision
that
i
think
this
court
ought
not
to
disturb.
my
principle
reason
here
appearing
is
an
amicus
is
not
so
much
to
argue
the
facts
of
whether
the
court's
decision
was
correct
or
whether
the
court
of
appeals
applied
the
correct
tests.
that
i
think
is
the
key
issue
in
this
case.
and
we
would
urge
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
apply
the
correct
tests.
where
they
reach
the
correct
result
applying
the
test
is
a
different
story.
well,
we
think
the
correct
test
should
be
one
as
the
court
of
appeals
did
of
whether
the
employer
and
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case
and
on
a
case
by
case
approach
adopted
a
--
had
a
legitimate
business
purpose
for
its
testing
requirement
or
for
its
educational
requirement.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
yes,
i
think
job
relationship
is
one
aspect
and
not
the
only
aspect
of
the
case.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
oh
absolutely!
but
it
should
not
be
determinative
either
under
the
eeoc's
guidelines
or
under
business
necessity
test.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
no,
i
would
--
my
feeling
is
you
can
never
prove
that
there
was
a
business
necessity
for
that
test
and
nor
that
it
was
job
related
in
the
sense
that
the
employers
had
to
have
that
skill
in
order
to
perform
the
job.
it
probably
would
not
--
if
it
had
not
as
i
understand
the
petitioner's
position,
if
it
had
not
been
validated
and
which
includes
job
relatedness.
under
the
eeoc's
guidelines,
the
employer
could
not
use
it.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
you
would
have
to
demonstrate
that
the
employers
could
not
do
the
job
if
they
did
not
have
an
understanding
of
english.
have
the
employer
--
that
an
understanding
of
english
was
essential
to
the
job.
the
employer
could
not
prove
those
two
points.
he
would
have
violated
the
law.
thank
you.
