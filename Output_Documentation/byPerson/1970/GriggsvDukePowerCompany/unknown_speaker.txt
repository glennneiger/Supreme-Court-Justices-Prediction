unknown
speaker
now,
i
understand
it
in
the
labor
department
that
that
was
the
only
growth
was
it?
unknown
speaker
what
my
real
question
is,
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
i
don't
know
that
i
fully
understand
it,
was
the
labor
department
all
negro
and
every
other
department
in
the
company
all
white,
this
is
prior
up
to
1965?
unknown
speaker
or
was
it
only
that
the
labor
department
was
all
negro
and
that
the
other
departments
coal
handling
did
have
some
negroes
in
it
or
not?
unknown
speaker
up
until
1965?
unknown
speaker
1965,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
there
were
no
negroes
in
the
other
four
departments?
unknown
speaker
i
just
was
surprise
as
a
matter
of
fact.
unknown
speaker
have
they
taken
and
failed
these
tests?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
you
said
these
are
four
identifiable
negro
workers
in
the
labor
department.
unknown
speaker
on
the
class
that
they
represent
beyond
their
own
number?
unknown
speaker
and
that
open-ended
class
was
accepted
was
it
by
the
courts?
unknown
speaker
oh!
may
be
subsequently
employed,
it's
not
future
applicants,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
its
employees?
unknown
speaker
and
there
are
now
four
identifiable
people
as
i
understand
your
submission.
unknown
speaker
you're
talking
about
14
(a)
or
the
--
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
if
these
four
people,
you
say
it's
not
clear
which
--
unknown
speaker
which
if
any
have
taken
the
tests
–
unknown
speaker
--
any
who
have,
have
all
failed.
unknown
speaker
but
it's
not
clear
that
any
of
these
four
have
taken
them,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
ask
it,
clarify
this,
today
if
a
person
applies
for
a
job
--
unknown
speaker
--
at
this
plant,
he
must
have
a
high
school
education
must
he
if
he
is
to
be
considered
for
employment
in
any
of
the
four
departments
other
than
the
labor
department?
unknown
speaker
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
he
must
do
both
now.
unknown
speaker
a
new
applicant
as
of
now
must
do
both,
would
he?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
it's
a
double
test,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
so
but
a
new
applicant
today
must
have
a
high
school
diploma
in
the
first
place?
unknown
speaker
and
then
must
be
also
take
the
both
the
wonderlic
test
and
the
bennett
or
bennett
tests?
unknown
speaker
and
this
is
true
for
all,
any
of
the
four
departments
other
than
the
labor
department?
unknown
speaker
and
as
of
today,
the
labor
department
still
requires
neither
of
those
qualifications.
unknown
speaker
now
when
you
say,
we're
talking
about,
are
you
talking
about
promotion
within
the
department
or
are
you
talking
about
interdepartmental
transfer?
unknown
speaker
but
--
unknown
speaker
the
--
unknown
speaker
--
existing
employees?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
so.
i've
had
a
little
trouble
of
the
facts
in
these
case
and
i
--
unknown
speaker
well,
nothing
that
i
heard
you
read
would
say
that
the
tests
could
be
non-job
related.
so
that
they
can
be
as
high
as
he
likes.
unknown
speaker
but
it
doesn't
say
they
can
be
wholly
irrelevant
to
the
job
that
is
being
employed
to
fill.
unknown
speaker
that
statutory
were
used
as
kind
of
a
slippery
and
ambiguous
word
in
this
context.
it
could
be
read
couldn't
it
and
as
i
gather
how
your
brothers
in
the
other
side
read
it.
that
is
if
they
are
used
results
in
discrimination
then
they're
use
to
discriminate
and
on
the
other
hand
it
could
be
read
as
if
they,
that
if
they're
not
subjectively
used
for
purposes
of
discrimination,
then
they're
alright.
i
simply
suggest
that
that's
not
the
clearest
word
in
the
world
in
this
context.
unknown
speaker
mr.
ferguson,
may
i
ask
you
one
question?
unknown
speaker
i'm
under
the
impression
that
there
were
14
original,
no
13
original
plaintiffs
here,
is
this
correct?
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
wonder
what
had
happen
to
him
and
this
is
the
answer
to
it
then.
unknown
speaker
alright.
unknown
speaker
what
--
where
are
you
reading?
unknown
speaker
mr.
greenberg,
perhaps
you're
saying
that
on
the
facts
here
there
are
--
the
company
hasn't
made
out
that
any
of
its
other
jobs,
the
higher
jobs
require
a
high
school
diploma
or
an
ability
to
pass
these
tests.
let's
assume
that
it
shall
not
though
although
the
jobs
in
which
they
were
hiring
initially
didn't
require
it.
unknown
speaker
i
know
we'll
have
different
case
but
as
you
come
out
on
it.
unknown
speaker
but
anyway,
promotions
are
from
inside
mostly?
unknown
speaker
as
judge
sobeloff,
i
gather
would
agree
with
what
you
just
said
and
he
said
that
however,
there's
been
no
showing
in
this
case
that
any
--
that
these
tests
are
related
in
any
of
these
other
jobs.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
general
allegations
that
there
are
a
lot
of
jobs
on
the
ladder
that
require
some
kind
of
abstract
skills
and
things
like
that
isn't
--
it's
just
not
enough?
unknown
speaker
now,
i
understand
it
in
the
labor
department
that
that
was

only
growth
