justice
potter
stewart
does
the
record
show
or
do
you
know
how
long
the
jury
deliberated?
justice
potter
stewart
how
long
did
the
trial
last?
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
any
event,
whether
it'd
be
5
or
12,
the
fact
remains
that
a
single
person
can
result
in
a
hung
jury
if
you
require
unanimity?
justice
potter
stewart
one,
and
that's
true
whether
it'd
be
5
or
12?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
buckley,
what
are
the
capital
crimes
in
louisiana,
murder?
justice
potter
stewart
rape,
aggravated
rape,
how
about
burglary?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
it's
murder,
aggravated
rape,
that's
it,
treason
i
suppose?
justice
potter
stewart
kidnapping,
even
when
the
victim
is
returned
unharmed?
justice
potter
stewart
if
we
were
9
out
of
12
for
murder
and
4
out
of
5
for
misdemeanor?
justice
potter
stewart
you'd
be
clearly
out
on
equal
--
on
you
equal
protection
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
can
still
have
a
--
it
doesn't
answer
the
equal
protection
claim,
does
it?
you
could
say
it
satisfies
due
process
for
a
state
to
charge
$20
a
year
for
an
auto
license
tag,
but
it
certainly
wouldn't
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
for
a
state
to
charge
$20
to
some
of
its
motorists
and
$10
to
the
others
based
on
some
irrational
classification,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
neither
one
would
violate
due
process?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose,
mrs.
korns,
it
could
be
argued,
although
i
know
your
counsel
doesn't
make
the
argument,
that
a
divided
jury
is
not
an
impartial
jury?
justice
potter
stewart
if
nine
of
them
are
partial
to
the
prosecution
and
three
of
them
are
partial
to
the
defense,
then
that's
not
an
impartial
jury,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i
wasn't
talking
about
that.
i
was
simply
getting
a
at
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
justice
potter
stewart
but
kalvin
&
zeisel
--
justice
potter
stewart
they're
not
in
the
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
the
word
“impartial”
is.
justice
potter
stewart
from
that
jury?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
he
gets
a
new
trial
and
he
gets
a
different
jury?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i
know.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
he'd
get
a
new
chance
before
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
from
kalven
&
zeisel.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
buckley
is
there
anything
in
this
record
to
indicate
the
identities
of
the
three
jurors
who
did
not
join
in
the
verdict
of
conviction,
that
is,
their
occupation,
their
race
or
anything
else?
justice
potter
stewart
you
refer
to
that
as
a
right,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
familiar
with
this
court’s
decision
in
warden
against
hayden,
for
instance?
justice
potter
stewart
why
do
you
think
the
court
spent
so
much
time
carving
out
an
exception
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
that
case
to
the
--
what
it
said
was
the
general
rule
that
you
cannot
make
an
arrest
in
a
house
without
a
warrant?
justice
potter
stewart
i
was
asking
about
warden
against
hayden?
justice
potter
stewart
which
involved
an
arrest?
justice
potter
stewart
how
it
got
an
exception
to
a
rule
and
that
would
have
been
rather
a
pointless
exercise
if
there
it
--
if
there
were
not
any
such
rule,
is
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
why
do
you
not?
justice
potter
stewart
as
long
as
you
have
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
it
might
have
been
just
exactly
that
rule
of
common
law
that
the
fourth
amendment
was
adopted
to
overrule,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
general
warrants

justice

well,
i
do
not

anybody
has
