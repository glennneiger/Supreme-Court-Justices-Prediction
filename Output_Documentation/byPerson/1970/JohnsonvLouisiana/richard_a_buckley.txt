mr.
richard
a.
buckley
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appealable
louisiana
supreme
court
decision
which
affirmed
appellant's
conviction
and
sentenced
for
the
crime
of
armed
robbery.
two
issues
considered
by
the
court
below
and
before
this
court
for
review
involve
the
question
of
jury,
the
question
of
arrest.
specifically
with
regard
to
the
jury
question,
there
are
two
aspects
to
it.
does
the
louisiana
jury
system
which
provides
for
a
non-unanimous
verdict
in
serious
felony
cases
clash
with
the
equal
protection
clause
because
it
denies
the
benefit
of
unanimity
to
appellant,
while
extending
it
to
those
charged
and
tried
for
greater
and
lesser
crimes.
the
second
aspect
of
the
jury
question
concerns
whether,
in
light
of
winship,
the
majority
verdict
is
constitutionally
permissible
in
that
appellant
has
not
been
proved
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
it
began
in
1898
when
louisiana
revised
its
constitution
and,
as
you
know,
grandfather
clause
and
other
provisions
were
made
at
that
time.
the
other
issue
that
was
considered
below
and
here
before
this
court
is
whether
appellant's
lineup
identification
which
the
appellant
contends
was
a
direct
result
of
an
unlawful
arrest
was
inadmissible
and
should
have
been
excluded
from
the
trial
of
his
case.
the
court
below,
in
response
to
the
two
issues
considered,
deferred
to
this
court
on
the
question
concerning
the
jury,
although
they
did
held
that
their
system
was
fair
and
gave
fairness
to
appellant's
trial.
and
in
regards
to
the
lineup
identification,
the
louisiana
supreme
court
found
a
lawful
arrest
based
upon
probable
cause.
the
relevant
facts
pertaining
to
the
two
issues
are
as
follows.
appellant,
a
black
citizen,
was
seized
in
his
home
before
daybreak
by
six
armed
new
orleans
detectives
with
shotguns
who
had
entered
his
home
without
a
warrant.
a
general
search
was
conducted
of
all
the
rooms,
no
evidence
connecting
the
appellant
with
the
crime
was
found
therein.
subsequent
to
some
interrogation,
appellant
was
booked
about
four
hours
after
the
initial
entering
of
his
home.
a
few
days
later,
appellant
was
part
of
a
general
lineup
consisting
of
armed
robbery
suspects
and
armed
robbery
victims,
and
he
was
identified
by
a
person
who
had
been
a
victim
of
an
armed
robbery
about
four
weeks
previous
to
appellant's
arrest.
i
made
mention
that
this
was
not
the
same
person
for
whom
appellant
was
booked
for
armed
robbery
initially
at
his
arrest.
the
lineup
identification
was
subsequently
used
at
trial.
in
fact,
the
identification
formed
the
primary
basis
of
the
evidence
against
appellant.
pretrial
motions
and
hearings
were
held
on
the
arrest
and
detention
of
appellant,
and
they
were
denied
by
the
trial
court.
appellant
was
tried
on
may
15,
1968
for
armed
robbery,
a
crime
punishable
in
louisiana
for
not
less
than
5
or
more
than
99
years
without
benefit
of
parole,
probation,
or
suspension
of
sentence.
the
jury
of
12
returned
a
verdict
of
9
for
guilty
and
3
for
not
guilty
which
constitutes
in
louisiana
a
conviction.
appellant
was
sentenced
subsequently
to
35
years
of
hard
labor
and
is
presently
serving
the
35
years
in
angola,
louisiana.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
i
don't
know
whether
the
record
shows
it,
i
believe
it
was
less
than
half-an-hour,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
the
trial
was
one
day.
most
of
the
facts,
of
course,
were
taken
up
in
pretrial
hearings
which
lasted
over
a
span
of
four
days.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
louisiana
conducts
separate
pretrial
and
the
trial
itself,
pretrial
hearings
concerning
the
arrest,
detention
etc
took
place
earlier,
and
over
a
span
of
three
days
they
were
out
without
a
jury.
in
regard
to
the
issue
of
whether
the
non-unanimous
verdict
is
a
denial
of
equal
protection,
i
briefly
mentioned
the
louisiana
jury
system.
louisiana
provides
that
in
capital
cases,
it'd
be
a
jury
consisting
of
12
of
which
all
must
concur.
in
crimes
that
could
be
punishable
by
hard
labor,
the
jury
consists
of
12
of
which
only
9
have
to
concur
in
the
verdict.
in
crimes
which
may
be
punishable
by
hard
labor,
the
jury
consists
of
5
jurors,
of
which
all
must
concur
in
the
verdict.
louisiana
asserts
the
reason,
and
this
has
also
been
explained
in
some
judicial
decisions
of
louisiana,
but
in
their
brief,
they
indicate
the
reason
for
this
difference
in
the
classification
between
the
different
crimes
and
the
way
they're
tried
is
to
reduce
cost
and
expedite
matters.
we
contend
that
this
is
not
a
rational
basis
for
louisiana
to
extend
unanimity
to
some
and
deny
to
the
appellant.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
yes.
if
i
may,
your
honor,
i'll
give
you
an
example
of
that.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
it
works
down
the
line
concerning
the
benefit
of
unanimity
and
the
function
it
plays
in
the
jury
trial,
your
honor,
which
i
can
show.
to
give
you
an
example
of
how
it
works
up
the
line
is
that,
as
you
know,
in
most
jurisdictions
louisiana
won,
in
a
capital
case,
the
jury
can
return
a
recommendation
that
the
punishment
be
without
the
death
penalty.
in
louisiana,
an
individual
that
the
jury
does
return
that
recommendation
to
is
eligible
for
parole
and
pardoned
within
12
years.
and,
asi
indicated
earlier,
an
individual
in
the
armed
--
convicted
of
armed
robbery,
as
appellant
was,
does
not
have
the
benefit
of
parole
or
probation
or
suspension
of
sentence
and
must
serve
the
entire
time
and
the
verdict
could
be
until
99
years.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
this,
by
the
way,
was
an
amendment
of
1966.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
i
believe
it's
harder
to
get
unanimity
out
of
five,
and
that
may
have
been
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
district
attorney
association
of
louisiana
has
attempted
twice
during
the
1960s
to
have
that
changed
from
five
to
four
out
of
five
unsuccessfully.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
i
feel
it
is,
your
honor,
because
five
out
of
five
forces
the
jurors
into
the
deliberating
process
and
in
the
exchange
of
the
doubts
that
each
may
have,
it
enables
them,
one
to
convince
another
and
the
two
groups,
two
coalitions
that
might
have
gone
in
there
with
different
views
are
able
then
to
persuade
one
group
to
the
other.
whereas,
in
a
9
out
of
12,
it's
possible,
as
in
this
case
it
may
have
happened,
that
the
jurors
went
immediately
from
the
jury
box
into
the
deliberation
and
made
a
vote
without
any
aspect
of
deliberating
process
coming
into
function.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
that
is
where
the
thrust
of
unanimity
comes,
that
you
must
--
the
jury
in
their
exchange
of
persuasion
among
themselves,
have
to
convince
that
person
who
has
the
most
strongest
doubt
whereas,
in
9
out
of
12,
the
9
least
that
are
in
doubt
--
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
the
usual,
murder,
aggravated
rape.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
no,
aggravated
burglary
and
burglary
are
tried
by
9
out
of
12.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
treason,
kidnapping.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
no,
i
don't
think
that
12
is
the
requirement.
it's
not
the
numbers
that's
important
as
this
court
so
well-expressed
in
williams.
i
think
it's
unanimity
in
its
function
and
its
close
and
direct
association
to
the
essential
jury
functions
that
is
the
key
to
the
problem.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
no,
we
wouldn't,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
i
--
because
then
we'd
still
have
the
argument
that
this
does
not
reach
the
constitutional
requirement
of
guilt
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
yes,
they
extended
it
both
ways.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
i
would.
there's
some
slippery
slope,
as
was
mentioned
in
williams
is
going
to
be
reached
very
soon
in
regard
to
the
jury
and
unanimity.
two
would
be
a
very
difficult
jury
to
cope
with.
you're
going
to
have
--
perhaps
have
a
split
from
the
beginning
and
it
may
result
in
many
hung
juries
there.
i
think
you'd
have
to
have
a
reasonable
number
that's
going
to
be
represented
about
the
community.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
i
believe
that
this
court
would
be
able
to
draw
better
i.
six
seems
to
work
and
perhaps
5,
as
now
existing
in
louisiana.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
constitutionally,
i
will
adhere
to
this
court's
decision
in
williams.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
there
is
a
point
that
reaches
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
only
in
regard
to
the
equal
protection
argument,
we're
not
attacking
the
number
of
five,
no,
your
honor.
another
aspect
with
regard
to
the
equal
protection
argument
is
that
kalven
&
zeisel,
the
american
jury
had
given
some
evidence
that
in
crimes
or
trials
where
the
verdict
has
to
be
unanimous,
there
are
hung
juries
about
5%
of
the
time,
whereas
in
non-unanimous
jury
verdict
type
cases
a
hung
jury
results
about
half
that
time.
taking
that
statistic
and
comparing
it
to
what
happens
to
the
hung
juries
in
the
unanimous
situations
and
those
which,
in
louisiana,
permits
convictions,
it
indicates,
as
expressed
in
our
brief,
that
there'll
be
a
result
about
44%
convictions
in
louisiana
and
about
12%
acquittals
if
you
use
the
statistics
that
kalven
has.
this,
of
course,
does
represent
that
there
is
a
greater
chance
of
conviction
than
acquittal
in
louisiana
scheme
of
providing
the
rule
of
9
out
of
12.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
no,
it's
not
the
constitutional
standing,
your
honor,
but
it
goes
to
show
the
value
of
the
mistrial
and
the
hung
jury
and
that
when
the
jury
in
this
league
begins
the
deliberation,
if
there
are
three
or
more
jurors
that
have
a
doubt,
this
represents
a
substantial
doubt,
and
i
think
that
the
statistics
in
the
american
juries
go
to
(inaudible)
and
for
louisiana
to
convict
on
that
basis
is
the
denial
of
the
constitutional
--
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
yes,
i
would,
your
honor,
personally.
i
don't
think
that
because
of
some
of
the
types
of
crimes
that
can
be
tried
under
the
9
out
of
12.
for
example,
the
communists
--
story
to
communist
propaganda
is
a
serious
felony
in
louisiana.
it
could
be
tried
by
the
rule
of
9,
that
any
time
limit
should
be
attached
to
deliberations,
like
a
very
vital
function
of
the
jury
is
performed
by
the
deliberative
process
and
it
should
not
be
restricted
in
any
way.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
i
think
it's
more
objectionable
in
criminal
case
to
permit
that
--
the
activity
you
described,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
that
is
also
another
aspect
of
it.
what
i'm
indicating
in
regard
to
this
particular
jury
verdict
is
that
there
might
not
have
been
any
deliberation,
and
that
is
permissible
under
the
jury
scheme
of
louisiana.
one
further
aspect
of
the
equal
protection
argument
we'd
like
to
make
is
that
the
divided
jury
verdicts
result
in
denial
of
essential
jury
functions
which
we
feel
are
closely
associated
with
the
unanimity
rule.
for
example,
a
significant
segment
of
the
community
in
louisiana,
25%
is
not
part
of
that
conviction
verdict.
thus,
instead
of
shared
responsibility
of
a
jury's
guilt
determination
process,
we
have
a
split
or
divided
responsibility.
there
is
a
possibility
that
minority
is
not
given
an
opportunity
to
express
its
views,
thus
rather
than
promote
group
deliberation,
split
verdicts
may
prevent
group
deliberation.
it
significantly
increases
the
chances
of
government
oppression.
it's
well-known
that,
in
the
past,
government
oppressions
works
on
the
basis
of
a
majority
will
and
the
minority,
the
three
jurors
in
louisiana,
may
be
citizens
who
were
involved
in
the
sitting
cases
in
1960,
garner
versus
louisiana,
keller
versus
louisiana,
and
in
lambert
versus
louisiana.
and,
finally,
after
obtaining
and
becoming
part
of
that
fair
cross-section
of
the
community,
be
it
keller
versus
louisiana
and
other
cases
this
court
has
decided
and
which
the
fifth
circuit
has
been
confronted
with,
again
in
the
1960s,
the
minority
of
three
jurors
excluded
at
the
end
may
be
from
that
section
of
the
community
which
has
just
present
--
recently
been
included
on
the
juries.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
i
would
rest
on
both
the
aspect
of
the
right
to
jury
and
the
right
to
a
fair
jury
and
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
that
without
--
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
--
without
the
requirement
of
unanimity,
it
is
going
to
cut
into
the
fairness
of
the
trial
and
therefore,
not
be
the
trial
as
--
the
trial
and
the
functions
and
purposes
as
expressed
by
this
court
in
duncan.
as
expressed
by
this
court,
in
re
winship,
gave
a
reasonable
doubt
standard
and
constitutional
status,
in
essence,
the
reasonable
doubt
standard
or
formula
is
merely
a
guide
to
both
prosecution
and
to
the
jury.
as
to
the
prosecution,
it
indicates
to
him
the
degree
of
proof
or
degree
of
persuasion
that
he
must
be
present
in
order
to
secure
a
conviction.
to
the
jury,
it
is
a
guide
to
indicate
to
them
the
degree
of
belief
of
the
individual's
guilt
in
order
for
them
to
return
and
agree
upon
a
conviction.
as
to
the
prosecution's
function,
his
is
to
the
fact
finder.
we
contend
that,
in
this
case,
the
fact
finding
body
consisted
of
a
jury
of
12
individuals
and
to
exclude
any
part,
that
fact
finding
body
would
be
unreasonable.
and,
in
this
case,
there
were
three
jurors
that
were
unpersuaded
and
unconvinced
by
the
evidence
presented
by
the
prosecutor.
and,
furthermore,
as
to
the
jury,
the
reasonable
doubt
standard
is
not
a
mechanical
process.
reasonable
men
differ
reasonably
about
the
proof
that
a
prosecutor
may
present
to
them.
that
is
the
value
of
the
jury's
deliberation
process,
so
that
during
deliberation,
views
could
be
expressed,
doubts
can
be
examined,
and
the
jury
can
finally
come
to
unanimity
on
a
particular
question
before
them.
deliberation
certainly
helps
to
clarify
some
of
the
juror's
doubts
and,
in
this
case,
there
may
not
have
been
any
deliberation
at
all.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
i
would
say,
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
that
jury
has
a
very
substantial
doubt
and
that
is
the
reason
why
they
cannot
come
to
an
agreement.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
after
that
long
period
of
time,
i
would
also
have
to
say
that.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
no,
your
honor,
that's
not
the
only
purpose.
i
am
trying
to
show
that
it's
one
of
the
essential
functions
of
the
unanimity
rule
which
is
directly
associated,
of
course,
with
the
reasonable
doubt
standard,
is
so
that
there
will
be
deliberation.
i'm
showing
that
what
results
there
are
when
there
is
no
deliberation.
the
--
how
this
can
dilute
and
water
down
the
reasonable
doubt
standard
itself
and
how
it
almost
is
a
mechanical
process
by
permitting
the
9-3
or
the
rule
of
9
is
for
them
to
go
in
and
take
their
initial
vote.
i
think
if
you
examine
most
of
the
split
decisions
that
have
been
appealed,
you
will
see
that
they
were
of
short
duration
of
deliberation,
most
of
them
under
an
hour.
in
others,
deliberation
goes
further,
they
most
likely
reach
--
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
no,
i'm
talking
about
oregon
and
louisiana
now,
the
other
jurisdictions
that
will
result
in
a
mistrial.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
correct,
about
5%,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
i'm
not,
again,
indicating
it
has
to
be
12,
but
all
those
that
are
around
the
jury
is
what
i
am
urging
must
agree
on
the
verdict
of
conviction.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
i
would
be,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
that
the
state
and
the
society
that
makes
the
laws
would
probably
prefer
something
less
--
more
further
than
servitude.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
but
it's
9
or
12.
in
three,
you
still
have
the
doubts,
your
honor,
and
that's
the
essential
feature.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
the
jury
as
a
whole
should
have
a
doubt
under
the
concept
of
the
reasonable
doubt
standard.
actually,
the
reasonable
doubt
standard
does
not
go
to
the
jury
as
a
whole.
it
goes
to
that
--
a
conviction
--
verdict
of
conviction
cannot
be
returned
with
any
individual
juror
having
a
doubt.
i
don't
want
to
get
mixed
up
in
theories
that
express
between
the
group
entity
and
the
individual
entity,
etcetera.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
only
if
they
were
sitting
on
the
same
type
of
case.
if
they
were
reviewing
from
the
initial
status,
a
criminal
trial,
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
no,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
well,
your
honor,
we
have
reserved
the
jury
function
to
layman
in
the
constitution
and
not
the
judges.
they're
totally
two
different
functions
and,
when
the
jury
speaks
and
if
they
speak
“not
guilty,”
it
concludes
that
matter.
as
we
know
--
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
this
goes
to
--
strictly
goes
to
the
question
of
law
and
we
also
--
this
is
given
for
another
added
protection
of
the
accused,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
it,
in
some
instances,
may
develop
facts,
but
it's
a
different
function
from
considering
the
facts
at
trial
and
the
witnesses,
etcetera,
that
were
there.
in
regard
to
the
second
issue
in
this
case
concerning
the
lineup
identification,
this
court
has
consistently
indicated
their
preference
and
reason
for
once.
i
feel
that
the
facts
of
this
case
show
why
this
preference
and
necessity
is
needed.
as
i
indicated
earlier
is
with
a
warrantless
arrest
in
a
home,
conducted
by
six
officers
armed
with
shotguns,
there
is
doubt
whether
the
officers
possessed
sufficient
probable
cause
to
secure
a
search
--
an
arrest
warrant
under
louisiana
law.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
it's
the
post
waive
--
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
he
had
a
lawyer
that
was
representing
all
of
the
suspects
that
were
--
did
not
have
their
own
individual
attorneys,
given
general
--
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
including
him,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
no,
not
--
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
we
first
--
we
argued
that
before
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana.
here,
we're
arguing
--
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
--
basically,
no
warrant,
time
to
get
a
warrant,
no
exceptional
circumstance
existing
here
for
them
to
proceed
without
first
obtaining
a
warrant.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
but
we
do,
in
pointing
out
why
such
a
case
requires
the
necessity
for
a
warrant,
and
have
indicated
that
there
is
a
chance
here
that
the
officer
did
not
have
probable
cause
to
secure
an
arrest
warrant
and,
that
is,
this
court
has
indicated
in
wong
sun,
in
subsequent
cases,
the
standard
of
probable
cause
should
be
at
least
as
strong
without
a
warrant
as
that
required
under
the
petitions
of
securing
a
warrant.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
in
a
home.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
this
particular
case,
your
honor,
yes,
with
respect
to
a
home.
we're
acquainted
with
the
circumstances
of
street
encounters
and
other
exception
is
made
by
this
court.
we're
restricting
it
to
the
home.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
it
has
been
a
basis
of
the
arrest
and
illegal
detention
to
follow,
very
similar
to
that
is
patton
versus
mississippi.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
case
is
on
appeal
of
the
louisiana
supreme
court’s
decision
which
affirmed
appellant’s
conviction
and
sentence
for
the
crime
of
armed
robbery.
the
two
important
issues
considered
by
the
louisiana
supreme
court
before
this
court
on
review
are
first
whether
the
seizure
of
appellant
from
a
warrantless
night
time
entry
into
his
home
violated
the
fourth
amendment’s
provision
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures.
and
secondly,
whether
the
louisiana
jury
system
which
extends
the
rule
of
unanimity
to
some
defendants,
but
denied
it
to
appellant
amounts
to
a
denial
of
equal
protection
and
also
whether
a
non-unanimous
verdict
is
constitutionally
permissible
in
light
of
the
due
process
requirement
that
guilt
be
established
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
relevant
facts,
most
important
facts
of
this
case
are
as
follows.
before
daybreak,
appellant,
a
young
black
citizen
was
seized
from
his
bed
by
six
new
orleans
detectives,
all
who
were
armed
with
shotguns
who
had
entered
johnson’s
home
without
a
warrant.
after
a
complete
search
of
the
home
and
additional
interrogation,
frank
johnson
was
booked
for
crime
of
armed
robbery.
three
days
later
was
part
of
a
general
lineup,
that
is
a
number
of
armed
robbery
suspects
were
put
in
a
lineup
and
viewed
by
a
number
of
armed
robbery
victims.
a
person
who
had
been
robbed,
four
weeks
prior
to
appellant’s
arrest
identified
frank
johnson.
this
person,
however,
was
not
the
one
for
which
the
appellant
had
been
arrested
and
booked.
the
lineup
identification
was
subsequently
used
at
the
trial.
pretrial
hearings
were
held,
where
the
appellant
challenged
his
arrest
and
his
detention
during
the
lineup.
appellant
was
tried
with
the
crime
of
armed
robbery
which
since
1966
in
louisiana
is
a
crime
punishable
from
5
to
99
years
without
the
benefit
of
pardon
or
parole.
the
primary
evidence
against
the
appellant
at
trial
was
the
eye
witness
identification
of
the
victim.
the
jury
verdict
is
9
for
guilty
and
three
for
not
guilty
which
in
louisiana
constitutes
a
conviction.
appellant
was
subsequently
sentenced
to
35
years
at
hard
labor
in
angola,
louisiana,
where
he
has
served
four
of
those
35
years.
in
their
brief,
louisiana
states
its
policy
of
never
obtaining
warrants
in
cases
of
this
nature.
this
policy
is
in
direct
conflict
with
this
court's
consistent
position
that
police
must
whenever
possible
obtain
judicial
approval
of
searches
and
seizures.
applying
either
the
warrant
test
or
even
the
visible
search
test,
the
facts
of
this
case
requires
the
finding
of
an
unreasonable
search
and
an
unlawful
seizure.
at
the
pretrial
hearings,
the
police
testified
that
there
was
no
reason
why
they
did
not
secure
a
warrant
nor
did
the
state
show
any
emergency
such
as
hot
pursuit
to
justify
the
warrantless
night
time
intrusion
into
appellant’s
home.
in
convenience
to
the
police,
the
only
reason
behind
louisiana’s
policy
of
not
securing
warrants
was
firmly
rejected
by
this
court
in
johnson
versus
louisiana,
and
has
been
adhered
to
since.
it
is
precisely
this
type
of
case
which
shows
the
necessity
to
require
the
police
to
adhere
to
the
fourth
amendment,
the
warrant
requirement.
based
upon
information
that
the
police
possessed
at
the
time
of
the
arrest,
it
is
doubtful
whether
an
arrest
warrant
could
have
been
secured
because
police
in
this
instance
did
not
know
the
date
or
the
place
of
the
alleged
defense.
on
the
basis
of
this
questionable
information,
the
police
made
their
own
determination
of
probable
cause,
they
made
their
own
determination
that
they
did
not
need
a
warrant
and
further
that
they
--
then
you
are
at
home
at
night,
even
in
light
of
the
louisiana
requirement
that
a
special
warrant
was
needed
for
night
time
searches.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
there
is
no
case
directly
i
can
find
mr.
justice
white,
however,
underlying
in
the
thrust
of
all
the
cases
which
have
alluded
to
the
exceptions
to
the
warrant
requirement
by
implication
this
court
is
indicating
that
a
warrant
is
required
prior
to
entering
a
home.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
even
for
the
--
it
is
not
so
much
the
arrest,
your
honor,
as
it
is
the
entry
into
the
home.
once
the
police
officers
went
there
and
made
the
entry,
they
are
conducting
a
search,
it
is
no
longer
--
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
then
we
would
examine
the
probable
cause.
there
are
instances
your
honor,
probable
cause
is
necessary.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
either
to
make
an
arrest
or
conduct
a
search.
there
is
an
additional
requirement
when
one
enters
the
home
and
that
is
a
warrant
unless
there
is
an
emergency
which
is
the
exception
to
the
warrant.
and
in
this
case
also,
the
police
officers
testified
that
they
planned
not
only
to
seize
appellant
in
his
home,
but
to
have
search
the
entire
home
for
evidence
and
in
fact
they
did.
these
certainly
are
not
reasons
to
avoid
obtaining
warrant,
but
as
been
said
in
this
court
before
mcdonald
versus
united
states,
they
are
clearly
compelling
reasons
why
the
police
seek
a
magistrate
and
attempt
to
convince
him
whether
a
warrant
is
authorized.
some
additional
factors
peculiar
to
this
case
which
shows
the
danger
of
at
least
a
probable
cause
is
that
the
appellant
was
never
tried
for
the
alleged
offense
which
was
formed
the
alleged
basis
of
the
police
probable
cause
and
the
probable
cause
for
the
arrest
of
appellant
was
not
reviewed
by
any
court
until
weeks
after
his
arrest.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
it
was
himself.
his
evidence
was
used
against
himself
like
he
was
detained
your
honor
and
he
was
identified
in
the
lineup
--
the
lineup
photo.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
other
than
his
person
being
placed
in
a
lineup,
he
would
have
never
been
charged
for
the
crime
for
which
he
was
convicted,
your
honor.
it
was
that
lineup
and
a
victim
made
his
identification,
the
evidence
used
from
that
lineup
was
the
major
evidence
at
the
trial.
once
he
was
identified,
in
fact,
that
was
the
trial
your
honors,
as
been
held
by
this
court
before.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
they
went
there
looking
for
a
gun,
but
there
was
no
seizure
of
a
gun.
however,
to
pick
up
on
your
point,
your
honor,
and
which
mr.
justice
white
indicated,
there
is
no
doubt
that
a
warrant
would
have
been
necessary
to
have
seized
the
gun.
it
is
our
position
that
the
seizure
of
the
person
is
a
greater
intrusion
than
to
go
there
to
search
and
seize
tangible
evidence
similar
to
that
of
a
gun.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
except
in
those
emergencies
which
this
court
has
found
as
an
exception.
for
example,
hot
pursuit
or
if
he
is
committing
a
crime
inside
the
house
in
which
the
police
have
knowledge
of
it
and
the
crime
is
being
committed
in
their
presence
at
that
time.
for
example
if
he
is
committing
an
assault
and
another
police
officer
were
(inaudible)
but
other
than
that,
it
is
true
that
there
is
no
entry
into
the
home
without
a
warrant.
in
regard
to
the
jury
issue,
a
power
of
search
that
the
divided
jury
verdict
was
in
violation
of
the
equal
protection
provisions
of
fourteenth
amendment.
louisiana
jury
system
is
unique
in
that
it
permits
three
types
of
jury
verdicts.
in
capital
cases,
the
jury
is
12,
in
which
all
the
12
must
concur
to
enter
a
verdict.
and
offenses
similar
to
appellants,
those
necessarily
punishable
by
hard
labor,
there
is
a
jury
of
12
of
which
only
9
have
to
concur
to
render
a
verdict.
and
then
in
cases
which
may
be
punishable
by
hard
labor,
the
jury
is
composed
of
five,
again,
all
five
of
which
must
concur
in
order
to
render
a
verdict.
so
we
have
greater
offenses
and
lesser
offenses
in
which
the
unanimity
rule
is
required.
but
not
in
appellant's
case
which
are
very
serious
felonies.
louisiana
do
not
ever
use
it
for
this
difference
to
reduce
cause
and
expedite
matters,
is
not
a
rational
basis
to
extend
the
significant
benefits
for
unanimity
to
some
defendants
and
to
deny
to
appellant's
class.
there
is
no
compelling
state
interest
to
which
they
can
withhold
their
unanimity
benefits
to
appellant
and
extend
it
to
others.
an
example
of
the
prejudicial
effect
is
that
in
capital
crimes,
an
individual
can
be
paroled
within
ten
and
a
half
years
after
sentence,
whereas
in
armed
robbery,
an
individual
can
get
up
to
99
years.
appellant
received
35
years
with
no
chance
of
parole
or
pardon
and
they
are
in
the
same
penitentiary.
unanimity
requirement
performs
a
significant
role
in
protecting
minority
groups
from
discriminatory
application
of
criminal
laws
by
the
majority.
this
of
course
assumes
that
members
of
the
minority
defendants
group
are
represented
on
the
jury.
for
the
past
100
years,
this
court
has
rendered
numerous
decisions
to
assure
that
members
of
appellant’s
race
are
not
entirely
excluded
from
the
jury
panel.
a
divided
jury
verdict
may
accomplish
in
a
subtle
indirect
manner
what
this
court
has
ruled
cannot
be
done
directly
and
that
is
excluding
members
of
appellant’s
race
from
the
jury.
there
were
three
black
male
jurors
on
appellant’s
jury,
but
the
record
does
not
reflect
which
jurors
voted
not
guilty.
for
various
reasons
in
a
capital
case,
majority
juries
may
persuade
the
majority
to
return
a
verdict
of
guilty
without
capital
punishment
or
guilty
of
a
lesser
included
crime.
this
can
be
accomplished
because
of
the
unanimity
rule
in
a
capital
case
in
louisiana
which
requires
the
majority
jurors
to
take
consideration
of
the
minority
view
points.
however,
this
is
precluded
in
the
case
in
which
appellant
was
tried
wherein
the
majority
can
reject
and
not
consider
the
minority
view
points.
take
for
example,
in
view
of
the
harsh
penalty
involved
in
this
crime
of
armed
robbery
in
louisiana,
the
same
minority,
in
appellant’s
case
may
have
been
prepared
and
capable
to
persuade
the
minority
to
return
a
verdict
of
a
lesser
crime,
say
for
example
simple
robbery,
especially
in
view
of
the
facts
of
this
case.
but
as
was
true
in
this
case
a
divided
jury
verdict
will
result
in
97%
of
the
trials
in
precluding
the
considerations
and
view
points
of
the
minority
jurors.
divided
jury
verdicts
permit
the
elimination
of
essential
jury
functions
which
this
court
stressed
and
underscored
in
williams
versus
florida.
the
exclusion
of
any
juror’s
participation
and
the
verdict
produces
results
contrary
to
those
dandridge
and
williams.
for
instance,
the
divided
verdict
is
a
split
rather
than
shared
responsibility
of
that
verdict
by
the
community.
it
may
prevent
rather
than
promote
group
deliberation.
in
this
case
the
jury
was
out
for
less
than
20
minutes
suggesting
a
verdict
in
the
first
ballot.
and
instead
of
having
actual
community
participation
in
the
verdict,
that
nine
out
of
twelve
verdicts
may
in
fact
represent
a
pretrial,
pre-deliberation,
prejudice
of
the
majority.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
there
is
nothing
your
honor.
i
checked
the
official
ballot
subsequent
to
the
last
argument
and
there
is
no
indication
there.
also
by
excluding
the
view
points
of
three
minority
jurors
is
very
doubtful
whether
this
verdict
represents
a
common
sense
judgment
of
the
jury
panel
of
the
12
jurors.
furthermore,
appellant’s
conviction
by
a
divided
jury
is
a
denial
of
a
due
process
requirement
that
the
state
prove
defendant’s
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
purposes
for
the
reasonable
doubt
standard
make
little
sense
without
the
unanimity
rule.
for
example,
instead
of
requiring
a
high
degree
of
proof,
majority
verdicts
allow
guilty
verdicts
when
three
jurors
have
not
been
persuaded
at
all.
this
suggests
strongly
that
there
is
a
possibility
that
the
reasonable
doubt
standard
was
not
even
applied.
and
rather
than
preserving
community
respect
and
competency
in
the
criminal
law,
the
majority
verdict
leaves
people
in
doubt
whether
innocent
persons
are
and
maybe
convicted,
especially
that
part
of
the
community
when
the
defendant
is
black
and
the
three
unconvinced
jurors
are
also
black.
substitution
of
a
different
standard
for
example,
clearly
convincing
proof
with
the
unanimity
requirement
would
probably
produce
more
certainty
and
fairness
than
a
use
of
a
reasonable
doubt
standard
where
25%
of
a
jury
remains
unconvinced
as
to
defendant’s
guilt.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
just
one,
a
comment
on
one
thing,
mr.
justice
marshall
is
that
we
got
into
this
case
two
weeks
subsequent
to
the
arrest
and
we
did
perceive
by
way
of
habeas
corpus,
up
and
down
the
louisiana
supreme
court
and
and
in
each
instance
it
was
denied
each
time
referring
to
the
authority
to
police
under
that
arrest
statute.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appealable
louisiana
supreme
court
decision
which
affirmed
appellant's
conviction
and
sentenced
for
the
crime
of
armed
robbery.
two
issues
considered
by
the
court
below
and
before
this
court
for
review
involve
the
question
of
jury,
the
question
of
arrest.
specifically
with
regard
to
the
jury
question,
there
are
two
aspects
to
it.
does
the
louisiana
jury
system
which
provides
for
a
non-unanimous
verdict
in
serious
felony
cases
clash
with
the
equal
protection
clause
because
it
denies
the
benefit
of
unanimity
to
appellant,
while
extending
it
to
those
charged
and
tried
for
greater
and
lesser
crimes.
the
second
aspect
of
the
jury
question
concerns
whether,
in
light
of
winship,
the
majority
verdict
is
constitutionally
permissible
in
that
appellant
has
not
been
proved
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
it
began
in
1898
when
louisiana
revised
its
constitution
and,
as
you
know,
grandfather
clause
and
other
provisions
were
made
at
that
time.
the
other
issue
that
was
considered
below
and
here
before
this
court
is
whether
appellant's
lineup
identification
which
the
appellant
contends
was
a
direct
result
of
an
unlawful
arrest
was
inadmissible
and
should
have
been
excluded
from
the
trial
of
his
case.
the
court
below,
in
response
to
the
two
issues
considered,
deferred
to
this
court
on
the
question
concerning
the
jury,
although
they
did
held
that
their
system
was
fair
and
gave
fairness
to
appellant's
trial.
and
in
regards
to
the
lineup
identification,
the
louisiana
supreme
court
found
a
lawful
arrest
based
upon
probable
cause.
the
relevant
facts
pertaining
to
the
two
issues
are
as
follows.
appellant,
a
black
citizen,
was
seized
in
his
home
before
daybreak
by
six
armed
new
orleans
detectives
with
shotguns
who
had
entered
his
home
without
a
warrant.
a
general
search
was
conducted
of
all
the
rooms,
no
evidence
connecting
the
appellant
with
the
crime
was
found
therein.
subsequent
to
some
interrogation,
appellant
was
booked
about
four
hours
after
the
initial
entering
of
his
home.
a
few
days
later,
appellant
was
part
of
a
general
lineup
consisting
of
armed
robbery
suspects
and
armed
robbery
victims,
and
he
was
identified
by
a
person
who
had
been
a
victim
of
an
armed
robbery
about
four
weeks
previous
to
appellant's
arrest.
i
made
mention
that
this
was
not
the
same
person
for
whom
appellant
was
booked
for
armed
robbery
initially
at
his
arrest.
the
lineup
identification
was
subsequently
used
at
trial.
in
fact,
the
identification
formed
the
primary
basis
of
the
evidence
against
appellant.
pretrial
motions
and
hearings
were
held
on
the
arrest
and
detention
of
appellant,
and
they
were
denied
by
the
trial
court.
appellant
was
tried
on
may
15,
1968
for
armed
robbery,
a
crime
punishable
in
louisiana
for
not
less
than
5
or
more
than
99
years
without
benefit
of
parole,
probation,
or
suspension
of
sentence.
the
jury
of
12
returned
a
verdict
of
9
for
guilty
and
3
for
not
guilty
which
constitutes
in
louisiana
a
conviction.
appellant
was
sentenced
subsequently
to
35
years
of
hard
labor
and
is
presently
serving
the
35
years
in
angola,
louisiana.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
i
don't
know
whether
the
record
shows
it,
i
believe
it
was
less
than
half-an-hour,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
the
trial
was
one
day.
most
of
the
facts,
of
course,
were
taken
up
in
pretrial
hearings
which
lasted
over
a
span
of
four
days.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
louisiana
conducts
separate
pretrial
and
the
trial
itself,
pretrial
hearings
concerning
the
arrest,
detention
etc
took
place
earlier,
and
over
a
span
of
three
days
they
were
out
without
a
jury.
in
regard
to
the
issue
of
whether
the
non-unanimous
verdict
is
a
denial
of
equal
protection,
i
briefly
mentioned
the
louisiana
jury
system.
louisiana
provides
that
in
capital
cases,
it'd
be
a
jury
consisting
of
12
of
which
all
must
concur.
in
crimes
that
could
be
punishable
by
hard
labor,
the
jury
consists
of
12
of
which
only
9
have
to
concur
in
the
verdict.
in
crimes
which
may
be
punishable
by
hard
labor,
the
jury
consists
of
5
jurors,
of
which
all
must
concur
in
the
verdict.
louisiana
asserts
the
reason,
and
this
has
also
been
explained
in
some
judicial
decisions
of
louisiana,
but
in
their
brief,
they
indicate
the
reason
for
this
difference
in
the
classification
between
the
different
crimes
and
the
way
they're
tried
is
to
reduce
cost
and
expedite
matters.
we
contend
that
this
is
not
a
rational
basis
for
louisiana
to
extend
unanimity
to
some
and
deny
to
the
appellant.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
yes.
if
i
may,
your
honor,
i'll
give
you
an
example
of
that.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
it
works
down
the
line
concerning
the
benefit
of
unanimity
and
the
function
it
plays
in
the
jury
trial,
your
honor,
which
i
can
show.
to
give
you
an
example
of
how
it
works
up
the
line
is
that,
as
you
know,
in
most
jurisdictions
louisiana
won,
in
a
capital
case,
the
jury
can
return
a
recommendation
that
the
punishment
be
without
the
death
penalty.
in
louisiana,
an
individual
that
the
jury
does
return
that
recommendation
to
is
eligible
for
parole
and
pardoned
within
12
years.
and,
asi
indicated
earlier,
an
individual
in
the
armed
--
convicted
of
armed
robbery,
as
appellant
was,
does
not
have
the
benefit
of
parole
or
probation
or
suspension
of
sentence
and
must
serve
the
entire
time
and
the
verdict
could
be
until
99
years.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
this,
by
the
way,
was
an
amendment
of
1966.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
i
believe
it's
harder
to
get
unanimity
out
of
five,
and
that
may
have
been
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
district
attorney
association
of
louisiana
has
attempted
twice
during
the
1960s
to
have
that
changed
from
five
to
four
out
of
five
unsuccessfully.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
i
feel
it
is,
your
honor,
because
five
out
of
five
forces
the
jurors
into
the
deliberating
process
and
in
the
exchange
of
the
doubts
that
each
may
have,
it
enables
them,
one
to
convince
another
and
the
two
groups,
two
coalitions
that
might
have
gone
in
there
with
different
views
are
able
then
to
persuade
one
group
to
the
other.
whereas,
in
a
9
out
of
12,
it's
possible,
as
in
this
case
it
may
have
happened,
that
the
jurors
went
immediately
from
the
jury
box
into
the
deliberation
and
made
a
vote
without
any
aspect
of
deliberating
process
coming
into
function.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
that
is
where
the
thrust
of
unanimity
comes,
that
you
must
--
the
jury
in
their
exchange
of
persuasion
among
themselves,
have
to
convince
that
person
who
has
the
most
strongest
doubt
whereas,
in
9
out
of
12,
the
9
least
that
are
in
doubt
--
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
the
usual,
murder,
aggravated
rape.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
no,
aggravated
burglary
and
burglary
are
tried
by
9
out
of
12.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
treason,
kidnapping.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
no,
i
don't
think
that
12
is
the
requirement.
it's
not
the
numbers
that's
important
as
this
court
so
well-expressed
in
williams.
i
think
it's
unanimity
in
its
function
and
its
close
and
direct
association
to
the
essential
jury
functions
that
is
the
key
to
the
problem.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
no,
we
wouldn't,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
i
--
because
then
we'd
still
have
the
argument
that
this
does
not
reach
the
constitutional
requirement
of
guilt
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
yes,
they
extended
it
both
ways.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
i
would.
there's
some
slippery
slope,
as
was
mentioned
in
williams
is
going
to
be
reached
very
soon
in
regard
to
the
jury
and
unanimity.
two
would
be
a
very
difficult
jury
to
cope
with.
you're
going
to
have
--
perhaps
have
a
split
from
the
beginning
and
it
may
result
in
many
hung
juries
there.
i
think
you'd
have
to
have
a
reasonable
number
that's
going
to
be
represented
about
the
community.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
i
believe
that
this
court
would
be
able
to
draw
better
i.
six
seems
to
work
and
perhaps
5,
as
now
existing
in
louisiana.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
constitutionally,
i
will
adhere
to
this
court's
decision
in
williams.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
there
is
a
point
that
reaches
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
only
in
regard
to
the
equal
protection
argument,
we're
not
attacking
the
number
of
five,
no,
your
honor.
another
aspect
with
regard
to
the
equal
protection
argument
is
that
kalven
&
zeisel,
the
american
jury
had
given
some
evidence
that
in
crimes
or
trials
where
the
verdict
has
to
be
unanimous,
there
are
hung
juries
about
5%
of
the
time,
whereas
in
non-unanimous
jury
verdict
type
cases
a
hung
jury
results
about
half
that
time.
taking
that
statistic
and
comparing
it
to
what
happens
to
the
hung
juries
in
the
unanimous
situations
and
those
which,
in
louisiana,
permits
convictions,
it
indicates,
as
expressed
in
our
brief,
that
there'll
be
a
result
about
44%
convictions
in
louisiana
and
about
12%
acquittals
if
you
use
the
statistics
that
kalven
has.
this,
of
course,
does
represent
that
there
is
a
greater
chance
of
conviction
than
acquittal
in
louisiana
scheme
of
providing
the
rule
of
9
out
of
12.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
no,
it's
not
the
constitutional
standing,
your
honor,
but
it
goes
to
show
the
value
of
the
mistrial
and
the
hung
jury
and
that
when
the
jury
in
this
league
begins
the
deliberation,
if
there
are
three
or
more
jurors
that
have
a
doubt,
this
represents
a
substantial
doubt,
and
i
think
that
the
statistics
in
the
american
juries
go
to
(inaudible)
and
for
louisiana
to
convict
on
that
basis
is
the
denial
of
the
constitutional
--
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
yes,
i
would,
your
honor,
personally.
i
don't
think
that
because
of
some
of
the
types
of
crimes
that
can
be
tried
under
the
9
out
of
12.
for
example,
the
communists
--
story
to
communist
propaganda
is
a
serious
felony
in
louisiana.
it
could
be
tried
by
the
rule
of
9,
that
any
time
limit
should
be
attached
to
deliberations,
like
a
very
vital
function
of
the
jury
is
performed
by
the
deliberative
process
and
it
should
not
be
restricted
in
any
way.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
i
think
it's
more
objectionable
in
criminal
case
to
permit
that
--
the
activity
you
described,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
that
is
also
another
aspect
of
it.
what
i'm
indicating
in
regard
to
this
particular
jury
verdict
is
that
there
might
not
have
been
any
deliberation,
and
that
is
permissible
under
the
jury
scheme
of
louisiana.
one
further
aspect
of
the
equal
protection
argument
we'd
like
to
make
is
that
the
divided
jury
verdicts
result
in
denial
of
essential
jury
functions
which
we
feel
are
closely
associated
with
the
unanimity
rule.
for
example,
a
significant
segment
of
the
community
in
louisiana,
25%
is
not
part
of
that
conviction
verdict.
thus,
instead
of
shared
responsibility
of
a
jury's
guilt
determination
process,
we
have
a
split
or
divided
responsibility.
there
is
a
possibility
that
minority
is
not
given
an
opportunity
to
express
its
views,
thus
rather
than
promote
group
deliberation,
split
verdicts
may
prevent
group
deliberation.
it
significantly
increases
the
chances
of
government
oppression.
it's
well-known
that,
in
the
past,
government
oppressions
works
on
the
basis
of
a
majority
will
and
the
minority,
the
three
jurors
in
louisiana,
may
be
citizens
who
were
involved
in
the
sitting
cases
in
1960,
garner
versus
louisiana,
keller
versus
louisiana,
and
in
lambert
versus
louisiana.
and,
finally,
after
obtaining
and
becoming
part
of
that
fair
cross-section
of
the
community,
be
it
keller
versus
louisiana
and
other
cases
this
court
has
decided
and
which
the
fifth
circuit
has
been
confronted
with,
again
in
the
1960s,
the
minority
of
three
jurors
excluded
at
the
end
may
be
from
that
section
of
the
community
which
has
just
present
--
recently
been
included
on
the
juries.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
i
would
rest
on
both
the
aspect
of
the
right
to
jury
and
the
right
to
a
fair
jury
and
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
that
without
--
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
--
without
the
requirement
of
unanimity,
it
is
going
to
cut
into
the
fairness
of
the
trial
and
therefore,
not
be
the
trial
as
--
the
trial
and
the
functions
and
purposes
as
expressed
by
this
court
in
duncan.
as
expressed
by
this
court,
in
re
winship,
gave
a
reasonable
doubt
standard
and
constitutional
status,
in
essence,
the
reasonable
doubt
standard
or
formula
is
merely
a
guide
to
both
prosecution
and
to
the
jury.
as
to
the
prosecution,
it
indicates
to
him
the
degree
of
proof
or
degree
of
persuasion
that
he
must
be
present
in
order
to
secure
a
conviction.
to
the
jury,
it
is
a
guide
to
indicate
to
them
the
degree
of
belief
of
the
individual's
guilt
in
order
for
them
to
return
and
agree
upon
a
conviction.
as
to
the
prosecution's
function,
his
is
to
the
fact
finder.
we
contend
that,
in
this
case,
the
fact
finding
body
consisted
of
a
jury
of
12
individuals
and
to
exclude
any
part,
that
fact
finding
body
would
be
unreasonable.
and,
in
this
case,
there
were
three
jurors
that
were
unpersuaded
and
unconvinced
by
the
evidence
presented
by
the
prosecutor.
and,
furthermore,
as
to
the
jury,
the
reasonable
doubt
standard
is
not
a
mechanical
process.
reasonable
men
differ
reasonably
about
the
proof
that
a
prosecutor
may
present
to
them.
that
is
the
value
of
the
jury's
deliberation
process,
so
that
during
deliberation,
views
could
be
expressed,
doubts
can
be
examined,
and
the
jury
can
finally
come
to
unanimity
on
a
particular
question
before
them.
deliberation
certainly
helps
to
clarify
some
of
the
juror's
doubts
and,
in
this
case,
there
may
not
have
been
any
deliberation
at
all.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
i
would
say,
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
that
jury
has
a
very
substantial
doubt
and
that
is
the
reason
why
they
cannot
come
to
an
agreement.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
after
that
long
period
of
time,
i
would
also
have
to
say
that.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
no,
your
honor,
that's
not
the
only
purpose.
i
am
trying
to
show
that
it's
one
of
the
essential
functions
of
the
unanimity
rule
which
is
directly
associated,
of
course,
with
the
reasonable
doubt
standard,
is
so
that
there
will
be
deliberation.
i'm
showing
that
what
results
there
are
when
there
is
no
deliberation.
the
--
how
this
can
dilute
and
water
down
the
reasonable
doubt
standard
itself
and
how
it
almost
is
a
mechanical
process
by
permitting
the
9-3
or
the
rule
of
9
is
for
them
to
go
in
and
take
their
initial
vote.
i
think
if
you
examine
most
of
the
split
decisions
that
have
been
appealed,
you
will
see
that
they
were
of
short
duration
of
deliberation,
most
of
them
under
an
hour.
in
others,
deliberation
goes
further,
they
most
likely
reach
--
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
no,
i'm
talking
about
oregon
and
louisiana
now,
the
other
jurisdictions
that
will
result
in
a
mistrial.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
correct,
about
5%,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
i'm
not,
again,
indicating
it
has
to
be
12,
but
all
those
that
are
around
the
jury
is
what
i
am
urging
must
agree
on
the
verdict
of
conviction.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
i
would
be,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
that
the
state
and
the
society
that
makes
the
laws
would
probably
prefer
something
less
--
more
further
than
servitude.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
but
it's
9
or
12.
in
three,
you
still
have
the
doubts,
your
honor,
and
that's
the
essential
feature.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
the
jury
as
a
whole
should
have
a
doubt
under
the
concept
of
the
reasonable
doubt
standard.
actually,
the
reasonable
doubt
standard
does
not
go
to
the
jury
as
a
whole.
it
goes
to
that
--
a
conviction
--
verdict
of
conviction
cannot
be
returned
with
any
individual
juror
having
a
doubt.
i
don't
want
to
get
mixed
up
in
theories
that
express
between
the
group
entity
and
the
individual
entity,
etcetera.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
only
if
they
were
sitting
on
the
same
type
of
case.
if
they
were
reviewing
from
the
initial
status,
a
criminal
trial,
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
no,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
well,
your
honor,
we
have
reserved
the
jury
function
to
layman
in
the
constitution
and
not
the
judges.
they're
totally
two
different
functions
and,
when
the
jury
speaks
and
if
they
speak
“not
guilty,”
it
concludes
that
matter.
as
we
know
--
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
this
goes
to
--
strictly
goes
to
the
question
of
law
and
we
also
--
this
is
given
for
another
added
protection
of
the
accused,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
it,
in
some
instances,
may
develop
facts,
but
it's
a
different
function
from
considering
the
facts
at
trial
and
the
witnesses,
etcetera,
that
were
there.
in
regard
to
the
second
issue
in
this
case
concerning
the
lineup
identification,
this
court
has
consistently
indicated
their
preference
and
reason
for
once.
i
feel
that
the
facts
of
this
case
show
why
this
preference
and
necessity
is
needed.
as
i
indicated
earlier
is
with
a
warrantless
arrest
in
a
home,
conducted
by
six
officers
armed
with
shotguns,
there
is
doubt
whether
the
officers
possessed
sufficient
probable
cause
to
secure
a
search
--
an
arrest
warrant
under
louisiana
law.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
it's
the
post
waive
--
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
he
had
a
lawyer
that
was
representing
all
of
the
suspects
that
were
--
did
not
have
their
own
individual
attorneys,
given
general
--
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
including
him,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
no,
not
--
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
we
first
--
we
argued
that
before
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana.
here,
we're
arguing
--
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
--
basically,
no
warrant,
time
to
get
a
warrant,
no
exceptional
circumstance
existing
here
for
them
to
proceed
without
first
obtaining
a
warrant.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
but
we
do,
in
pointing
out
why
such
a
case
requires
the
necessity
for
a
warrant,
and
have
indicated
that
there
is
a
chance
here
that
the
officer
did
not
have
probable
cause
to
secure
an
arrest
warrant
and,
that
is,
this
court
has
indicated
in
wong
sun,
in
subsequent
cases,
the
standard
of
probable
cause
should
be
at
least
as
strong
without
a
warrant
as
that
required
under
the
petitions
of
securing
a
warrant.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
in
a
home.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
this
particular
case,
your
honor,
yes,
with
respect
to
a
home.
we're
acquainted
with
the
circumstances
of
street
encounters
and
other
exception
is
made
by
this
court.
we're
restricting
it
to
the
home.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
it
has
been
a
basis
of
the
arrest
and
illegal
detention
to
follow,
very
similar
to
that
is
patton
versus
mississippi.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
case
is
on
appeal
of
the
louisiana
supreme
court’s
decision
which
affirmed
appellant’s
conviction
and
sentence
for
the
crime
of
armed
robbery.
the
two
important
issues
considered
by
the
louisiana
supreme
court
before
this
court
on
review
are
first
whether
the
seizure
of
appellant
from
a
warrantless
night
time
entry
into
his
home
violated
the
fourth
amendment’s
provision
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures.
and
secondly,
whether
the
louisiana
jury
system
which
extends
the
rule
of
unanimity
to
some
defendants,
but
denied
it
to
appellant
amounts
to
a
denial
of
equal
protection
and
also
whether
a
non-unanimous
verdict
is
constitutionally
permissible
in
light
of
the
due
process
requirement
that
guilt
be
established
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
relevant
facts,
most
important
facts
of
this
case
are
as
follows.
before
daybreak,
appellant,
a
young
black
citizen
was
seized
from
his
bed
by
six
new
orleans
detectives,
all
who
were
armed
with
shotguns
who
had
entered
johnson’s
home
without
a
warrant.
after
a
complete
search
of
the
home
and
additional
interrogation,
frank
johnson
was
booked
for
crime
of
armed
robbery.
three
days
later
was
part
of
a
general
lineup,
that
is
a
number
of
armed
robbery
suspects
were
put
in
a
lineup
and
viewed
by
a
number
of
armed
robbery
victims.
a
person
who
had
been
robbed,
four
weeks
prior
to
appellant’s
arrest
identified
frank
johnson.
this
person,
however,
was
not
the
one
for
which
the
appellant
had
been
arrested
and
booked.
the
lineup
identification
was
subsequently
used
at
the
trial.
pretrial
hearings
were
held,
where
the
appellant
challenged
his
arrest
and
his
detention
during
the
lineup.
appellant
was
tried
with
the
crime
of
armed
robbery
which
since
1966
in
louisiana
is
a
crime
punishable
from
5
to
99
years
without
the
benefit
of
pardon
or
parole.
the
primary
evidence
against
the
appellant
at
trial
was
the
eye
witness
identification
of
the
victim.
the
jury
verdict
is
9
for
guilty
and
three
for
not
guilty
which
in
louisiana
constitutes
a
conviction.
appellant
was
subsequently
sentenced
to
35
years
at
hard
labor
in
angola,
louisiana,
where
he
has
served
four
of
those
35
years.
in
their
brief,
louisiana
states
its
policy
of
never
obtaining
warrants
in
cases
of
this
nature.
this
policy
is
in
direct
conflict
with
this
court's
consistent
position
that
police
must
whenever
possible
obtain
judicial
approval
of
searches
and
seizures.
applying
either
the
warrant
test
or
even
the
visible
search
test,
the
facts
of
this
case
requires
the
finding
of
an
unreasonable
search
and
an
unlawful
seizure.
at
the
pretrial
hearings,
the
police
testified
that
there
was
no
reason
why
they
did
not
secure
a
warrant
nor
did
the
state
show
any
emergency
such
as
hot
pursuit
to
justify
the
warrantless
night
time
intrusion
into
appellant’s
home.
in
convenience
to
the
police,
the
only
reason
behind
louisiana’s
policy
of
not
securing
warrants
was
firmly
rejected
by
this
court
in
johnson
versus
louisiana,
and
has
been
adhered
to
since.
it
is
precisely
this
type
of
case
which
shows
the
necessity
to
require
the
police
to
adhere
to
the
fourth
amendment,
the
warrant
requirement.
based
upon
information
that
the
police
possessed
at
the
time
of
the
arrest,
it
is
doubtful
whether
an
arrest
warrant
could
have
been
secured
because
police
in
this
instance
did
not
know
the
date
or
the
place
of
the
alleged
defense.
on
the
basis
of
this
questionable
information,
the
police
made
their
own
determination
of
probable
cause,
they
made
their
own
determination
that
they
did
not
need
a
warrant
and
further
that
they
--
then
you
are
at
home
at
night,
even
in
light
of
the
louisiana
requirement
that
a
special
warrant
was
needed
for
night
time
searches.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
there
is
no
case
directly
i
can
find
mr.
justice
white,
however,
underlying
in
the
thrust
of
all
the
cases
which
have
alluded
to
the
exceptions
to
the
warrant
requirement
by
implication
this
court
is
indicating
that
a
warrant
is
required
prior
to
entering
a
home.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
even
for
the
--
it
is
not
so
much
the
arrest,
your
honor,
as
it
is
the
entry
into
the
home.
once
the
police
officers
went
there
and
made
the
entry,
they
are
conducting
a
search,
it
is
no
longer
--
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
then
we
would
examine
the
probable
cause.
there
are
instances
your
honor,
probable
cause
is
necessary.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
either
to
make
an
arrest
or
conduct
a
search.
there
is
an
additional
requirement
when
one
enters
the
home
and
that
is
a
warrant
unless
there
is
an
emergency
which
is
the
exception
to
the
warrant.
and
in
this
case
also,
the
police
officers
testified
that
they
planned
not
only
to
seize
appellant
in
his
home,
but
to
have
search
the
entire
home
for
evidence
and
in
fact
they
did.
these
certainly
are
not
reasons
to
avoid
obtaining
warrant,
but
as
been
said
in
this
court
before
mcdonald
versus
united
states,
they
are
clearly
compelling
reasons
why
the
police
seek
a
magistrate
and
attempt
to
convince
him
whether
a
warrant
is
authorized.
some
additional
factors
peculiar
to
this
case
which
shows
the
danger
of
at
least
a
probable
cause
is
that
the
appellant
was
never
tried
for
the
alleged
offense
which
was
formed
the
alleged
basis
of
the
police
probable
cause
and
the
probable
cause
for
the
arrest
of
appellant
was
not
reviewed
by
any
court
until
weeks
after
his
arrest.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
it
was
himself.
his
evidence
was
used
against
himself
like
he
was
detained
your
honor
and
he
was
identified
in
the
lineup
--
the
lineup
photo.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
other
than
his
person
being
placed
in
a
lineup,
he
would
have
never
been
charged
for
the
crime
for
which
he
was
convicted,
your
honor.
it
was
that
lineup
and
a
victim
made
his
identification,
the
evidence
used
from
that
lineup
was
the
major
evidence
at
the
trial.
once
he
was
identified,
in
fact,
that
was
the
trial
your
honors,
as
been
held
by
this
court
before.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
they
went
there
looking
for
a
gun,
but
there
was
no
seizure
of
a
gun.
however,
to
pick
up
on
your
point,
your
honor,
and
which
mr.
justice
white
indicated,
there
is
no
doubt
that
a
warrant
would
have
been
necessary
to
have
seized
the
gun.
it
is
our
position
that
the
seizure
of
the
person
is
a
greater
intrusion
than
to
go
there
to
search
and
seize
tangible
evidence
similar
to
that
of
a
gun.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
except
in
those
emergencies
which
this
court
has
found
as
an
exception.
for
example,
hot
pursuit
or
if
he
is
committing
a
crime
inside
the
house
in
which
the
police
have
knowledge
of
it
and
the
crime
is
being
committed
in
their
presence
at
that
time.
for
example
if
he
is
committing
an
assault
and
another
police
officer
were
(inaudible)
but
other
than
that,
it
is
true
that
there
is
no
entry
into
the
home
without
a
warrant.
in
regard
to
the
jury
issue,
a
power
of
search
that
the
divided
jury
verdict
was
in
violation
of
the
equal
protection
provisions
of
fourteenth
amendment.
louisiana
jury
system
is
unique
in
that
it
permits
three
types
of
jury
verdicts.
in
capital
cases,
the
jury
is
12,
in
which
all
the
12
must
concur
to
enter
a
verdict.
and
offenses
similar
to
appellants,
those
necessarily
punishable
by
hard
labor,
there
is
a
jury
of
12
of
which
only
9
have
to
concur
to
render
a
verdict.
and
then
in
cases
which
may
be
punishable
by
hard
labor,
the
jury
is
composed
of
five,
again,
all
five
of
which
must
concur
in
order
to
render
a
verdict.
so
we
have
greater
offenses
and
lesser
offenses
in
which
the
unanimity
rule
is
required.
but
not
in
appellant's
case
which
are
very
serious
felonies.
louisiana
do
not
ever
use
it
for
this
difference
to
reduce
cause
and
expedite
matters,
is
not
a
rational
basis
to
extend
the
significant
benefits
for
unanimity
to
some
defendants
and
to
deny
to
appellant's
class.
there
is
no
compelling
state
interest
to
which
they
can
withhold
their
unanimity
benefits
to
appellant
and
extend
it
to
others.
an
example
of
the
prejudicial
effect
is
that
in
capital
crimes,
an
individual
can
be
paroled
within
ten
and
a
half
years
after
sentence,
whereas
in
armed
robbery,
an
individual
can
get
up
to
99
years.
appellant
received
35
years
with
no
chance
of
parole
or
pardon
and
they
are
in
the
same
penitentiary.
unanimity
requirement
performs
a
significant
role
in
protecting
minority
groups
from
discriminatory
application
of
criminal
laws
by
the
majority.
this
of
course
assumes
that
members
of
the
minority
defendants
group
are
represented
on
the
jury.
for
the
past
100
years,
this
court
has
rendered
numerous
decisions
to
assure
that
members
of
appellant’s
race
are
not
entirely
excluded
from
the
jury
panel.
a
divided
jury
verdict
may
accomplish
in
a
subtle
indirect
manner
what
this
court
has
ruled
cannot
be
done
directly
and
that
is
excluding
members
of
appellant’s
race
from
the
jury.
there
were
three
black
male
jurors
on
appellant’s
jury,
but
the
record
does
not
reflect
which
jurors
voted
not
guilty.
for
various
reasons
in
a
capital
case,
majority
juries
may
persuade
the
majority
to
return
a
verdict
of
guilty
without
capital
punishment
or
guilty
of
a
lesser
included
crime.
this
can
be
accomplished
because
of
the
unanimity
rule
in
a
capital
case
in
louisiana
which
requires
the
majority
jurors
to
take
consideration
of
the
minority
view
points.
however,
this
is
precluded
in
the
case
in
which
appellant
was
tried
wherein
the
majority
can
reject
and
not
consider
the
minority
view
points.
take
for
example,
in
view
of
the
harsh
penalty
involved
in
this
crime
of
armed
robbery
in
louisiana,
the
same
minority,
in
appellant’s
case
may
have
been
prepared
and
capable
to
persuade
the
minority
to
return
a
verdict
of
a
lesser
crime,
say
for
example
simple
robbery,
especially
in
view
of
the
facts
of
this
case.
but
as
was
true
in
this
case
a
divided
jury
verdict
will
result
in
97%
of
the
trials
in
precluding
the
considerations
and
view
points
of
the
minority
jurors.
divided
jury
verdicts
permit
the
elimination
of
essential
jury
functions
which
this
court
stressed
and
underscored
in
williams
versus
florida.
the
exclusion
of
any
juror’s
participation
and
the
verdict
produces
results
contrary
to
those
dandridge
and
williams.
for
instance,
the
divided
verdict
is
a
split
rather
than
shared
responsibility
of
that
verdict
by
the
community.
it
may
prevent
rather
than
promote
group
deliberation.
in
this
case
the
jury
was
out
for
less
than
20
minutes
suggesting
a
verdict
in
the
first
ballot.
and
instead
of
having
actual
community
participation
in
the
verdict,
that
nine
out
of
twelve
verdicts
may
in
fact
represent
a
pretrial,
pre-deliberation,
prejudice
of
the
majority.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
there
is
nothing
your
honor.
i
checked
the
official
ballot
subsequent
to
the
last
argument
and
there
is
no
indication
there.
also
by
excluding
the
view
points
of
three
minority
jurors
is
very
doubtful
whether
this
verdict
represents
a
common
sense
judgment
of
the
jury
panel
of
the
12
jurors.
furthermore,
appellant’s
conviction
by
a
divided
jury
is
a
denial
of
a
due
process
requirement
that
the
state
prove
defendant’s
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
purposes
for
the
reasonable
doubt
standard
make
little
sense
without
the
unanimity
rule.
for
example,
instead
of
requiring
a
high
degree
of
proof,
majority
verdicts
allow
guilty
verdicts
when
three
jurors
have
not
been
persuaded
at
all.
this
suggests
strongly
that
there
is
a
possibility
that
the
reasonable
doubt
standard
was
not
even
applied.
and
rather
than
preserving
community
respect
and
competency
in
the
criminal
law,
the
majority
verdict
leaves
people
in
doubt
whether
innocent
persons
are
and
maybe
convicted,
especially
that
part
of
the
community
when
the
defendant
is
black
and
the
three
unconvinced
jurors
are
also
black.
substitution
of
a
different
standard
for
example,
clearly
convincing
proof
with
the
unanimity
requirement
would
probably
produce
more
certainty
and
fairness
than
a
use
of
a
reasonable
doubt
standard
where
25%
of
a
jury
remains
unconvinced
as
to
defendant’s
guilt.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
buckley
just
one,
a
comment
on
one
thing,
mr.
justice
marshall
is
that
we
got
into
this
case
two
weeks
subsequent
to
the
arrest
and
we
did
perceive
by
way
of
habeas
corpus,
up
and
down
the
louisiana
supreme
court
and
and
in
each
instance
it
was
denied
each
time
referring
to
the
authority
to
police
under
that
arrest
statute.
