ms.
louise
korns
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
beginning
of
my
argument,
i'd
like
to
inquire
whether
it
would
be
possible
maybe
to
have
a
little
more
time
in
view
of
--
than
the
regular
half
hour
in
view
of
the
two
very
important
questions
posed
by
this
case,
but
i'll
certainly
leave.
ms.
louise
korns
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
louise
korns
certainly,
your
honor.
to
begin
with
on
the
jury
question,
the
first
question
in
the
case,
just
to
touch
briefly
on
the
historical
background
of
a
majority
jury
verdict
system.
as
this
court
knows,
various
theories
have
been
advanced
to
explain
why
unanimous
jury
verdicts
became
required
in
many
jurisdictions,
particularly
in
england,
up
until
1967
between
the
18th
century,
about
1967.
and,
chief
--
lord
justice
devlin,
i
think
most
writers
concede
that
lord
justice
devlin's
theory
that
it
was
purely
by
chance
is
the
correct
theory.
as
lord
justice
devlin
and
i
think
professor
fayer
(ph)
also
in
the
harvard
law
review
point
out,
during
the
middle
ages
in
england,
a
trial
by
compurgation
there
was
the
custom
of
a
party
having
to
have
his
oaths
--
his
version
of
the
facts
supported
by
the
oath
of
12
jurors.
so,
they
would
assemble
12
compurgators.
if
these
12
compurgators
couldn't
support
the
oath
of
the
party,
they'd
keep
adding
to
him
and
adding
to
him
until,
finally,
out
of
who
knows
how
many
number,
100,
they
had
12
men
swearing
to
the
position
of
one
party,
and
then
he
won
the
case.
just
to
skip
briefly
over,
it
is
the
function
of
the
jury
ran
in
the
12th
century
gradually
changed
to
judging
credibility
rather
than
swearing
to
it.
the
practice
of
adding
extra
jurors
was
eliminated,
but
the
requirement
that
the
crown
obtained
12
votes
to
convict
was
kept
and,
therefore,
as
mr.
justice
devlin
points
out,
the
unanimity
requirement
grew
out
of
a
majority
system
of
jury
verdicts
in
which
at
least
12
votes
were
needed
to
support
a
verdict
out
of
an
untold
number.
now
at
the
present
time,
as
this
court
knows,
majority
verdicts
exist
not
only
in
six
states
in
this
country,
as
well
as
puerto
rico,
but
in
many
--
in
countries
which
formally
were
part
of
the
british
commonwealth,
notably,
it
had
existed
in
scotland
8-7
verdict
for
time
immemorial
and
worked
very
well.
and
england,
as
this
court
knows,
in
1967
adopted
in
the
criminal
justice
act
of
that
year,
adopted
majority
verdicts
in
criminal
trials.
specifically,
the
law
requires
that
where
a
jury
consists
of
not
more
than
11,
10
can
bring
in
a
verdict.
where
a
jury
consists
of
not
more
than
10,
nine
can
bring
in
a
verdict
provided
that
a
verdict
of
guilty
cannot
be
brought
in
by
a
majority
verdict
unless
the
jury
has
deliberated
at
least
two
hours.
i
think
this
court
is
familiar
with
the
fact
that,
in
england,
jurors
drop
out
during
the
trial
rather
than
alternate
jurors,
but
that's
immaterial
and
i
won't
go
into
that
point.
as
this
court
also
knows,
because
it
pointed
out
in
williams
versus
florida,
we
had
majority
verdicts
in
colonial
times
in
a
number
of
states,
notably
pennsylvania,
connecticut,
and
the
carolinas
i
think.
as
this
court
also
pointed
out
in
williams
versus
florida,
it
rejected
in
fact
in
williams
versus
florida
the
argument
that
every
feature
of
the
common
law
jury,
as
it
existed,
at
the
time
our
constitution
was
growing
up
was
incorporated
in
our
constitution
every
time
the
word
“jury”
is
mentioned.
this
court
rejected
that
and
pointed
out
that,
as
originally
submitted
by
mr.
james
madison
in
the
house
--
to
the
house
and
as
originally
adopted
by
the
house,
the
jury
amendment
required
that,
among
other
things,
the
jury
–
a
verdict
must
be
unanimous.
that
it
passed
the
house
this
way
was
rejected
in
the
senate
and,
as
ultimately
adopted,
the
sixth
amendment
only
said
that
in
a
criminal
trial,
an
accused
is
entitled
to
trial
by
jury,
what
kind,
and
impartial
jury.
it
doesn't
mention
the
number
or
whether
it
has
to
be
unanimous.
now,
we
get
right
down
to
the
issue
in
this
case
as
i
see
it,
as
was
posed
by
this
court
in
a
footnote
in
williams
in
which
it
said
it
took
no
stand
on
whether
a
majority
verdict
violated
due
process.
and,
as
this
--
as
louisiana
sees
it,
the
issue
is
very
simple.
whether
the
use
by
a
state
of
a
majority
verdict
in
a
criminal
trial
violates
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
it
infringes
the
principle
that
a
person
accused
of
crime
cannot
be
convicted
except
upon
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
every
fact
necessary
to
constitute
the
crime.
that
is
the
issue
for
decision
as
far
as
louisiana
sees
it.
as
louisiana
sees
it,
the
equal
protection
argument
is
really
subordinate
and
not
important
because
if
in
fact
a
majority
verdict
satisfies
due
process,
as
we
think
it
does,
the
equal
protection
question
really
goes
out
of
the
picture
because,
as
soon
as
everyone
similarly
situated
is
treated
as
the
way
the
appellant
here
was,
that
is,
everybody
in
louisiana
accused
of
a
crime
for
which
the
punishment
is
necessarily
hard
labor
is
treated
the
same
way
as
we
see
it,
the
crucial
question
is
whether
a
majority
jury
verdict
satisfies
or
violates
due
process
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
that
to
us,
is
the
crux.
ms.
louise
korns
well
--
ms.
louise
korns
well,
actually,
the
truth
is,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
as
i
studied
this
case
and
evaluated
it,
i
arrived
at
that
conclusion.
i
just
express
because
as
we
--
i'll
show
later
in
the
argument,
there's
no
difference
in
the
percentage
of
convictions
between
cases
tried
by
majority
verdict
and
cases
tried
by
unanimous
verdict,
and
that
would
be
the
crux
of
any
unequal
protection
argument.
as
i
see
it,
what
can
an
accused
argue
on
his
equal
protection
argument,
unless
he
can
say
“look,
i
have
a
10
or
15
or
20%
greater
chance
of
being
convicted
by
a
majority
verdict
than
another
person
in
my
state
has
who
is
accused
of
another
type
of
crime.”
as
i
see
it,
that's
the
only
type
of
unequal
protection
argument
you
can
make.
ms.
louise
korns
yes,
your
honor?
ms.
louise
korns
well,
right
there,
there
would
be
a
monetary
loss
to
the
person
who
had
to
buy
the
license,
if
nothing
else.
but,
our
position
in
this
case,
there
is
no
loss
to
the
accused
about
--
by
being
tried
by
a
majority
rather
than
a
unanimous
verdict.
so,
i
don't
--
excuse
me,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
don't
think
the
argument
is
parallel
in
the
view
of
the
position
we
take
because,
certainly
if
one
person
had
to
pay
$10
for
a
license
then
another
person
had
to
pay
$20,
right
there
is
the
difference
of
$10,
somebody's
being
hurt
$10.
ms.
louise
korns
well,
there
again,
in
the
alternative
i'd
say
it
wasn't,
right.
on
the
alternative
i'd
say
it
wasn't,
but
right
at
the
beginning
we
say
that
in
louisiana
--
that
every
--
all
the
study
i've
been
doing
on
this
case,
since
i
first
started
working
on
this
brief,
convinces
me
more
and
more
that
there
is
absolutely
no
higher
rate
of
conviction
in
jurisdictions
in
cases
tried
by
majority
verdict
than
in
unanimous
verdict
cases,
and
i'll
explain
to
the
court
why
when
i
get
into
the
analyzing
the
way
a
jury
arrives
at
its
verdict
as
mrs.
kalven
&
zeisel
had
pointed
out
in
their
brief.
ms.
louise
korns
if
the
jury
in
louisiana
brings
in
a
verdict
of
guilty
without
capital
punishment,
technically,
the
accused
is
sentenced
to
prison
for
life,
but
life,
life
i
think
--
i'm
not
sure
what
life
means,
mr.
justice
marshall,
but
it
doesn't
mean
natural
life.
ms.
louise
korns
as
we'll
point
out,
mr.
justice
marshall,
he
has
about
1%
less
chance,
about
1%,
and
when
you
go
into
the
convictions
on
retrial,
that's
a
whole
second
point
in
our
brief,
it's
immaterial
on
a
practical
basis.
there
is
really
--
and
the
more
you
study
it,
the
more
you
--
ms.
louise
korns
well,
that's
a
good
question
and
my
position
is
the
more
i
study
it,
i
think
it's
purely
psychological
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
wouldn't
see
any
difference.
i
don't
think
if
you
allow
a
9
out
of
12
verdict,
there
would
be
any
higher
conviction
right
and
the
only
trouble
with
having
a
9
out
of
12
jury
involving
--
when
a
jury
has
to
bring
in
a
death
sentence
is
that,
perhaps
because
death
and
putting
someone
to
death
fills
people
with
guilt
and
awe,
it
may
be
that
9
wouldn't
act
if
12
held
out
as
they
will
just
for
punishment
because
of
the
finality,
but
that's
the
only
difference
i
see
because,
as
i
will
show
in
my
second
point
in
this
argument,
there
is
no
difference
--
when
you
study
the
question
and
you'll
see
how
juries
operate,
there
is
no
difference
between
the
conviction
rate
when
the
verdict
is
a
majority
verdict
or
when
it's
a
unanimous
verdict.
it's
--
see,
in
england,
when
they
went
--
i
studied
lots
of
english
materials
in
writing
this
brief.
mr.
roy
jenkins,
he
was
home
secretary
and
who
pushed
the
majority
verdict
through
parliament
because
he
was
so
convinced
it
would
help
the
administration
of
justice
in
england,
he
states
and
his
arguments
are
summarized
in
these
various
british
journals
that
i've
cite
in
my
brief,
he
stated
in
the
house
of
commons
or
someone
stated
for
him
that
he
was
sure
that
the
innocent
would
not
suffer
for
this,
and
he
pointed
to
the
time
honored
practice
in
scotland
of
brining
in
a
criminal
verdicts
by
8-7,
15-man
jury,
8
can
convict.
and,
he
pointed
out
that,
certainly,
in
scotland
nobody
had
ever
complained
that
there
was
--
that
the
innocent
suffered
or
that
there
was
any
discrimination
against
an
accused
because
he
was
convicted
by
8
out
of
15
men.
ms.
louise
korns
only
in
duncan,
it
was
attacked
on
the
basis
that
we
allow
trials
before
judges
when
the
punishment
could
be
up
to
two
years,
and
we
lost
that
case.
and,
this
court
said
we
had
to
have
juries
for
anything
over
--
for
any
serious
crime
which,
in
ballwin,
this
court
narrowed
down
to
six
months.
but,
actually,
after
we
lost
duncan,
we
then
amended
our
laws
to
have
everybody
either
to
bring
down
the
punishment
to
six
months
or
to
allow
a
jury
trial
in
anything
over
six
months.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
the
first
part
of
our
constitutional
provision
here
which
is
set
out
on
pages
324
of
louisiana's
brief
is
that
all
trials
in
misdemeanor
cases
shall
be
by
judges,
but
then
we
had
sentences
up
to
two
years.
therefore,
this
court's
decision
in
duncan
cut
across
that
first
provision
of
our
constitution
which
goes
on
and
says
“you
see,
it's
very
logical
the
way
the
con
--
the
way
the
legislature
set
it
up
in
1898.”
they
said
all
misdemeanors
shall
be
by
a
judge
alone.
all
crimes
which
may
be
punished
by
hard
labor
shall
be
by
a
five-man
jury,
all
of
whom
must
concur.
all
crimes
which
shall
be
punished
by
hard
labor,
which
is
the
instant
one,
shall
be
by
a
12-man
jury,
9
of
whom
must
concur.
all
capital
crimes
shall
be
by
a
12-man
jury,
all
of
whom
must
concur.
that's
the
way
we
set
it
up
and
that's
the
way
it
still
is,
except
for
the
duncan
provision
that
cuts
across
the
trial
of
misdemeanors
if
more
than
--
a
sentence
of
more
than
six
months
can
be
imposed.
ms.
louise
korns
no,
we
have
never
had
it.
this
is
res
nova.
this
is
it
right
here,
and
that's
why
i
say
this
is
very
important
for
louisiana,
this
case
and
this
point.
ms.
louise
korns
well,
i
don't
think
it
does,
your
honor.
in
the
alternative,
that's
my
second
point,
but
just
to
--
you
see,
the
whole
picture
of
the
appellant's
case
has
been
here
and
that's
why
i
researched
this
so
carefully.
their
whole
case
has
been
locked.
we've
been
denied
due
process
of
law
because
we
had
a
much
greater
chance
to
be
convicted
than
somebody
tried
by
unanimous
jury
or
a
five-man
juries.
and
so,
since
that
was
a
pitch
of
their
argument,
this
is
what
i
researched
and
built
up,
i
agree
with
you.
in
england,
for
instance,
they
say
“well,
what
we
want
to
do
is
catch
the
guilty
people.”
they're
very
frank
about
it
you
see,
and
i
don't
see
any
harm
as
long
as
you're
not
unfair
in
trying
to
convict
criminals
and
put
them
where
society
intends
them
to
be.
but,
to
get
back
to
the
due
process
argument,
your
honors,
this
is
--
ms.
louise
korns
i
beg
your
pardon?
ms.
louise
korns
when?
in
1967.
ms.
louise
korns
it
had
been
unanimous
from
about
--
ms.
louise
korns
--
the
13th
century
when,
as
i
say,
mr.
justice
devlin
said
it
developed
by
chance.
and,
from
19
--
13th
century
up
until
the
20th,
of
course,
it
existed
at
the
time
the
american
colonies
were
formed
and
that's
why
it's
clothed
in
this
sort
of
mythical
status
in
this
country.
as
i
say,
when
you
tear
all
fiction
and
fantasy
aside
though,
there
is
no
harm
to
the
accused
and
a
lot
of
help
to
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
from
using
a
majority
verdict
system.
ms.
louise
korns
exactly.
ms.
louise
korns
exactly.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
you
read
about
why
mr.
james
madison's
jury
amendment
ran
into
so
much
trouble
in
the
senate,
that's
exactly
why
it
ran
into
trouble
in
the
senate.
ms.
louise
korns
no,
actually
--
ms.
louise
korns
the
only
way
you
can
say
--
the
only
logical
argument
a
person
can
make
about
needing
a
unanimous
jury
requirement
in
capital
--
in
criminal
trials
is
only
two
arguments
they
can
make,
as
i
see
it.
one
is
the
argument
which
this
court
rejected
in
williams
versus
florida,
that
is
an
--
but
which
the
court
had
sort
of
sanctioned
in
earlier
cases,
but
which
it
repudiated
in
williams
versus
florida
and
that
is,
that
the
jury
as
it
existed
at
common
law
in
england
at
the
time
our
constitution
was
drafted
is
the
jury
that
the
drafters
of
the
constitution
had
in
mind.
this
court
rejected
that
idea
in
williams
when
they
rejected
the
12-man
jury
because
at
the
time
the
englishmen
founded
--
settled
american
colonies,
they
had
a
12-man
unanimous
jury,
that
was
rejected
in
williams.
now,
the
only
other
argument
you
can
make
is
“look,
i
stand
an
unfair
chance
of
being
convicted
under
this
type
of
jury
system.”
somehow,
rather,
i'm
going
to
be
convicted.
i'm
not
going
to
--“
see,
they
all
get
that
the
reasonable
doubt
standard
is
violated,
and
this
court
held
in
in
re
winship
that
the
fact
that
an
accused
had
to
be
convinced
by
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
was
part
of
the
due
process.
so,
that's
the
crux
of
their
argument.
if
they're
9
out
of
--
if
a
9-3
verdict
comes
in,
it
means
that
3
men
doubted
and
the
burden
of
proof
hasn't
been
carried.
well,
the
flaw
in
that
argument
is
this.
this
jury
came-in
in
20
minutes,
to
answer
the
question
of
mr.
justice
stewart
i
think,
in
20
minutes.
i
surmise
that
they
must
have
gone
out,
elected
their
foreman,
and
it
was
a
first-to-second
ballot,
they
came-in
in
20
minutes.
statistic
show
in
this
kalven
&
zeisel's
study
of
the
american
jury
with
which
this
court
is
familiar,
i
know
because
they
--
this
court
cited
it
in
the
williams
versus
florida,
study
show
that
any
jury
and
the
american
jury,
this
book,
includes
majority
verdicts
so
it
includes
louisiana
juries.
any
jury
with
deliberate
juror
--
when
a
jury
deliberates
long
enough,
it
will
reach
unanimity
in
95%
of
the
case.
they
say
that
over
and
over
again.
that's
why
in
the
present
case,
there's
no
--
there
was
a
95%
chance
if
this
jury
had
not
come
back
into
the
courtroom
at
the
end
of
20
minutes
with
a
9-3
verdict
of
guilty,
there's
a
95%
chance
that
if
they
had
sat
there
long
enough
it
would've
reached
unanimity.
there
is
no
chance
in
louisiana's
view
that
it
would've
acquitted
the
accused
because
kalven
&
zeisel
show
in
their
book
that
once
a
majority,
a
great
majority
develops
like
9-3
it
is
almost
impossible
for
the
minority
to
persuade
the
majority.
they
say
only
with
extreme
infrequency
does
a
minority
persuade
the
majority
to
change
its
mind.
ms.
louise
korns
see,
they
--
i
agree
with
you,
mr.
justice
black,
but
i'm
just
trying
to
answer
their
questions.
they
were
arguments
they
made
to
say
why
this
court
should
set
aside.
they
claim
that
it's
because
the
reasonable
doubt
principle
is
infringed,
there's
a
higher
chance
of
their
being
convicted,
and
so
i
just
answered
their
questions.
i'll
agree
with
you.
i
don't
think
it
is.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
ms.
louise
korns
well,
this
court
decided
in
williams
that
12
was
not
needed.
that's
what
this
court
decided
in
williams
and
this
court
then
went
on
to
point
out
that
five-man
jury
it
did
not
think
--
it
thought
it
was
large
enough.
well,
in
the
first
place,
it
said
a
jury
has
satisfied
the
requirement
which
is
the
primary
requirement
of
jury
trials,
that
a
body
of
laymen
be
interposed
between
the
government
and
the
accused
as
a
protection
against
tyranny.
the
body
and
the
five
men
they
said
and
you
all
--
this
court
said
that
williams
satisfied
and
certainly,
12-man
jury,
9
of
whom
must
concur
to
render
a
verdict
certainly
serve
the
same
function.
it
serves
as
a
shield
between
the
government
and
the
accused,
that
keeps
the
government
from
oppressing
the
citizen
by
standing
there
as
a
body
of
impartial
laymen.
and,
one
of
--
a
member
of
this
court
asked,
i
think
it
was
mr.
justice
black,
does
a
federal
jury
have
to
be
unanimous.
i
say,
it
doesn't
and
the
proof
is
that
they
had
to
enact
a
statute
to
make
it
that
way.
in
other
words,
if
the
constitution
just
was
clear,
you
know,
even
almost
clear,
that
a
jury
had
to
be
unanimous,
why
would
the
federal
--
why
would
us
code
provide
that
it
had
to
be
unanimous?
ms.
louise
korns
the
constitution
only
said
that,
in
all
criminal
trials,
the
sixth
amendment,
the
accused
is
entitled
to
a
trial
by
an
impartial
jury
and
that's
all
it
says,
an
impartial
jury
of
the
neighborhood
in
which
the
crime
occurred,
that's
all
the
constitution
said.
and,
the
unanimity
and
12-man
requirements
which
were
originally
in
the
sixth
amendment,
as
this
court
noticed
from
williams,
was
struck
--
was
stricken
out
in
--
by
the
senate
and
as
adopted.
in
other
words,
the
draft
is
rejected,
both
the
12-man
and
the
unanimity.
ms.
louise
korns
well,
you
see
--
ms.
louise
korns
but
you
see,
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
fallacy
of
that
argument
is
that
this
jury
would've.
there
was
a
95%
chance
of
this
jury
becoming
that
way,
and
when
you
study
the
way
juries
reach
unanimity,
you
understand
more
what
i
mean.
kalven
&
zeisel
say
that
--
ms.
louise
korns
right,
that's
right.
exactly,
that's
his
argument.
ms.
louise
korns
that's
his
argument.
ms.
louise
korns
they're
not
in
the
constitution
but
they
say--
ms.
louise
korns
right.[attempt
to
laughter]
their
theory
that
they
document
is
that
the
jury
makes
up
its
mind
in
the
courtroom
and
actually,
if
you
adopt
this,
brazil
has
the
right
way
of
doing
it.
in
brazil,
the
jurors
listen
to
the
case,
they
walk
out
and,
by
written
ballot,
they
write
guilty
or
innocent.
no
deliberation,
and
the
accused
is
--
and
the
majority
verdict
decides.
now,
kalven
&
zeisel
also
throw
grave
doubt
on
the
whole
deliberation
process
of
the
jury.
they
point
out
that
the
first
vote
of
the
jury
out
of
the
room
determines
the
end
vote,
and
they
show
it
time
and
again.
and,
they
say
the
deliberation
process
is
only
their
arriving
at
a
consensus
and
actually
louisiana
says
the
same
sorts
of
pressures,
only
more
subtle,
now
operate
to
produce
unanimity
in
a
jury
as
operated.
as
this
court
knows,
in
the
middle
ages
they
were
locked
up
without
food,
drink,
fire,
or
candle.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
even
took
them
by
court
to
the
next
circuit
when
they
went
if
the
jurors
hadn't
made
up
their
mind.
ms.
louise
korns
certainly
not
[attempt
to
laughter]
certainly
not,
mr.
justice
black.
they
argue
from
that,
though,
kalven
&
zeisel
show
that
the
same
sorts
of
pressure
is
exerted
on
juries
now
they
are
more
subtle
and
psychological
naturally.
he
points
out
that
if
--
that
the
minority
always
gives
into
the
majority
--
no,
95%
of
the
time,
the
minority
gives
into
the
majority
just
because
they
lose
ground
and
so
forth
and
the
minority
never
turns
the
majority
around,
never.
so,
what's
the
use
of
any
deliberation
be
--
once
you
establish,
say
nine
votes.
reach
nine
votes
and
come
out,
they
are
never
going
to
turn
around
and
acquit
that
man
when
nine
of
them
think
he's
guilty.
the
most
the
accused
can
hope
for
is
a
hung
jury.
ms.
louise
korns
from
that
jury,
right.
ms.
louise
korns
well,
right,
but
they
get
the
new
trial,
mr.
justice
stewart,
and
there
are
no
figures
to
show
what
the
rate
of
convictions
are
on
the
new
trial.
ms.
louise
korns
some
people
think
they
are
higher
and
some
people
think
they
are
lower,
but
they're
at
least
we
can
assume,
they're
going
to
be
a
certain
number
of
convictions
on
a
new
trial.
so,
what
does
he
get,
but
a
faint
hope
that,
on
a
new
trial,
he
might
get
a
convic
--
an
acquittal.
his
point
is
that,
right
in
line
of
what
you've
told
us,
that
once
nine
people
are
against
him,
he
is
cut
from
that
jury,
but
if
you
require
unanimity
he
wouldn't
be
because
he'd
get
at
least
a
hung
jury--
ms.
louise
korns
exactly.
ms.
louise
korns
right,
exactly.
that's
all
he
can
hope
for.
there's
[attempt
to
laughter]
no
doubt
about
it.
ms.
louise
korns
right,
the
95%
chance
that
they'll
persuade
the
3,
95%
chance,
right.
ms.
louise
korns
that's
from
kalven
&
zeisel,
right.
[attempt
to
laughter]
ms.
louise
korns
he
used
kalven
&
zeisel
first,
mr.
justice
stewart.
they
base
their
whole
case
on
kalven
&
zeisel.
so,
i've
got
to
study
kalven
&
zeisel,
or
else
the
rope
is
around
my
neck,
as
it
were,
because
--
ms.
louise
korns
right,
exactly.
just
briefly,
i'd
like
to
remind
this
court
of
everything
that
is
saved
by
a
12-man
jury,
i
mean,
a
majority
verdict.
although
the
majority--that's
the
second
part
in
our
brief,
that
although
the
majority
verdict
only
ultimately
affects
the
verdict
in
a
tiny
minority
of
cases
because
as
i
pointed
out,
they
would
reach
unanimity
and
so
forth,
it
saves
time
in
every
case.
like
in
this
case,
the
jury
came-in
in
20
minutes.
it
reduces
the
danger
of
mistrial
by
about
2%
and
really,
it
was
because
of
this
that
england
--
as
you
read
these
english
materials,
you'll
see
that
the
home
secretary
pressed
this
new
law
because
england
had
been
having
a
lot
of
trouble
with
what
they
call
“nobbling.”
nobbling
is
the
intimidation
or
bribing
of
jurors
to
prevent
a
unanimous
verdict.
and,
as
they
pointed
out,
it
just
wastes
time,
money,
and
judge
power
to
have
to
spend,
especially
in
a
long
case
like
the
manson
case,
supposing
they
had
had
a
mistrial.
well,
anyway,
it
just
saves
time,
money,
and
judge
power
to
have
a
majority
verdict.
ms.
louise
korns
yes?
ms.
louise
korns
i'll
do
that.
ms.
louise
korns
so
you
don't
want
to
give
us
any
more
time
then.
ms.
louise
korns
alright,
fine.
i'll
go
on
to
the
other
point.
well,
my
other
point
is
just
that
we
don't
see
that
there
has
been
any
argument
at
all
that
can
be
made
for
getting
a
warrant
to
make
an
arrest
in
a
home.
the
home
has
never
been
a
sanctuary
against
arrest
ever.
at
common
law
what
simmons
(ph)
case
said
the
privilege
of
the
house
does
not
run
against
the
king,
never
has
a
home
--
this
is
the
one
exception
to
the
principle
that
a
man's
home
is
his
castle.
the
one
exception,
it
cuts
right
across
it,
is
that
a
man
--
the
privilege
of
a
man's
house
does
not
run
against
the
king,
in
other
words,
translated
--
ms.
louise
korns
right,
no
doubt
about
it.
i
agree
[attempt
to
laughter]
with
you,
but
you
don't
have
to
have
a
warrant,
right.
at
common
law,
there's
no
doubt
about
it,
mr.
justice
white.
arrest
could
be
made
without
a
warrant
in
a
house
based
on
probable
cause.
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
a
practical
matter.
i
call
this
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that,
in
all
his
powers,
the
police
make
about
50,000-55,000
arrests
a
year.
i'd
say
100
or
1,000
a
week
with
a
--
well,
as
this
court
--
i
just
went
in
to
this
before
this
court
in
vale,
the
length
of
time
it
takes
to
make
out
an
arrest
warrant,
to
type
that
probable
cause
to
--
ms.
louise
korns
very
few,
mr.
justice
marshall.
in
fact
--
ms.
louise
korns
no,
it's
just
that's
the
only
way
the
court
can
operate
--
the
police
can
operate.
they
only
make
out
arrest
warrants.
they
never
--
you
see,
we
have
an
article
213,
the
code
of
criminal
procedure.
this
is
an
article
that
all
jurisdictions
have.
it's
a
codification
of
the
common
law.
the
federal
agents,
various
ones,
they
have
no
broad
statute
like
our
article
213
because
they
don't
have
general
peace
keeping
power.
but,
the
fbi,
the
narcotics
agents,
the
united
states
marshals,
the
selective
service
among
others
have
the
right
by
statute
upon
a
showing
--
when
they
have
a
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
a
crime's
been
committed,
to
make
an
arrest
without
a
warrant,
and
all
jurisdictions
have
this
law
like
213
and
as
a
practical
matter,
the
police
couldn't
operate.
they'd
have
to
double
the
police
force
if
they
had
to
swear
out
55,000
arrest
warrants
a
year.
ms.
louise
korns
no,
the
search
is
immaterial,
mr.
justice
marshall.
ms.
louise
korns
well,
six
men
always
go
to
an
armed
robber's
house.
they
do.
ms.
louise
korns
right,
because
he's
an
armed
robber.
ms.
louise
korns
well,
see,
they
went
to
the
--
ms.
louise
korns
well,
i
don't
think
--
ms.
louise
korns
well,
they
knocked
on
the
door.
they
didn't
have
to
force
their
way
in.
ms.
louise
korns
yes,
they
knocked.
ms.
louise
korns
no,
they
knocked
and
introduced
themselves
and
explained
their
reason
to
be
there
ms.
louise
korns
it
was
ms.
johnson
who
came
to
the
door.
ms.
louise
korns
it
was
--
mr.
johnson
was
under
the
bed.
ms.
johnson
came
to
the
door.
[laughter]
mr.
johnson
got
under
the
bed.
ms.
louise
korns
yes,
they
found
him
under
the
bed.
the
po
--
ms.
louise
korns
would
the
court
like
to
hear
the
facts
of
the
case?
ms.
louise
korns
thank
you.
ms.
louise
korns
yes,
i
remember
that.
ms.
louise
korns
it
was
called
--
i
remember
it.
ms.
louise
korns
that
is
true,
it
does.
i've
forgotten
the
name
of
that
cast.
ms.
louise
korns
thank
you.
ms.
louise
korns
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue,
the
decision,
two
issues
for
decision
before
this
court
today
are
clearly
of
whether
louisiana
is
going
to
be
allowed
to
keep
nine
out
of
twelve
jurors
and
its
right
to
arrest
a
man
in
a
home
on
probable
cause
without
a
warrant.
ms.
louise
korns
well,
we
have
a
statutory
right,
mr.
justice
stewart
under
louisiana
code
of
criminal
procedure
article,
the
louisiana
police
have
the
right
to
make
an
arrest
upon
probable
cause.
it
is
sort
of
like
federal
statutes,
only
it
is
a
broad
statute.
instead
of
like
a
federal
statutes
saying
narcotics
agents
can
make
arrest
without
--
we
have
set
out
in
our
brief,
we
have
various
articles
of
the
criminal
code,
louisiana
criminal
code
saying
that
police
officers
may
arrest
for
a
crime
when
reasonable
cause
exists
to
believe
that
a
crime
has
been
committed,
it
being
committed
and
so
forth.
and
then
an
another
article
right
after
that
says
that
an
arrest
maybe
made
anytime,
any
place
and
instead
article
says,
these
are
all
set
out
in
the
second
part
of
our
brief
where
we
discussed
this
on
page
21
of
our
brief,
that
the
police
may
enter
any
dwelling
to
make
an
arrest
if
first,
they
announced
their
authority
and
purpose
and
then
if
they
are
a
denied
entry
they
may
break
the
door.
in
our
brief,
louisiana
took
position
and
takes
a
position
that
both
that
our
jury
is
alright
under
the
sixth
amendment
and
that
our
statutory
laws
permitting
arrest
in
the
home
without
warrant
is
valid
under
the
fourth
amendment.
however,
in
the
alternative
in
this
oral
argument,
i
would
like
to
advance
this
further
alternative
argument.
that
if
this
court
should
hold
that
a
nine
to
twelve
jury
is
not
permissible
under
the
sixth
amendment
and
an
arrest
in
the
home
without
warrant
is
not
valid
under
the
fourth
amendment,
but
nevertheless
both
of
these
actions
are
valid
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
that
the
state
should
be
permitted
to
follow
them,
even
though
the
federal
government
cannot
and
i
say
this
for
these
reason.
i
realize
that
in
making
this
argument
i
have
to
ask
the
court
not
really
to
overrule,
but
to
modify
in
these
two
areas.
it
is
a
holding
that
it
has
had
gradually
been
developing
during
these
past
years
as
it
selectively
incorporated
various
guarantees
of
the
bill
of
rights
into
the
fourteenth
amendment.
along
with
it
this
court
i
think
has
also
up
until
the
present
time
fairly
much
held
that
that
once
--
that
although
--
it
has
never
held,
this
--
a
majority
of
this
court
has
never
held
that
the
bill
of
rights
was
automatically
incorporated
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
however,
i
think
that
the
majority
of
this
court
has
increasingly
been
holding
that
once
this
court
finds
that
a
guarantee
in
the
bill
of
rights
applies
to
the
states
through
the
fourteenth
amendment
then
every
facet,
every
constitutional
standard
of
the
--
the
constitutional
standard
applying
against
the
state
government
and
the
federal
government
are
the
same.
i
believe
i
am
right
there.
now,
i
was
very
much
impressed
in
restudying
this
case
for
re-argument
with
mr.
justice
fortas'
concurring
opinion
in
duncan.
and
thus
i
what
i
say
in
--
although
our
primary
position
is
that
a
non-unanimous
jury
is
permissible
under
the
sixth
amendment
because
of
everything
we
set
out
in
our
brief,
of
the
unanimity
principle
being
deleted,
the
fact
that
four
of
the
original
13
states
had
majority
verdicts,
the
fact
that
many
common
law
jurisdictions
with
juries
presently
have
majority
verdicts
such
as
scotland,
england,
went
to
it
in
1967
and
so
forth.
so
our
first
position
is
that
a
majority
verdict
jury
is
valid
under
sixth
amendment.
in
the
alternative
we
say
that
if
this
court
should
hold
that
it
is
not,
it
was
not
the
intent
of
the
framers
that
that
the
federal
courts
used
juries
which
returned
less
than
unanimous
verdicts,
we
nevertheless
alternatively
take
the
position
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
majority
verdict
that
violates
a
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
we
ask
this
court
as
mr.
justice
fortas
very,
very
intelligently
pointed
out
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
duncan,
a
jury
trial
is
not
a
principle
of
justice
like
self
incrimination
and
the
first
amendment
right.
it
is
rather
a
system
of
procedure
and
he
pointed
out
that
he
thought
that
if
this
court
insisted
that
the
states
and
the
federal
government
be
--
with
down
to
every
single
detail
identical
that
we
would
have
rigidity,
conformism
that
we
would
--
it
would
go
against
our
principle
of
federalism,
they
would
prevent
us
from
being
able
to
try
out
one
thing
in
one
jurisdiction
and
another
thing
in
another
jurisdiction
and
he
thought
that
this
would
have
a
very
adverse
effect
on
our
whole
principle
of
federalism.
and
i
think
mr.
justice,
the
late
mr.
justice
harlan,
pointed
out
in
his
concur
--
dissenting
opinion
in
williams
this
very
the
same
thing.
he
said
that
he
thought
that
this
court
should
reexamine
its
whole
--
the
whole
principle
of
incorporation
because
he
said
if
it
did
not,
that
he
thought
there
was
going
to
be
a
labeling
and
rigid
process
that
was
going
to
set
in
making
all
the
50
states
with
their
different
problems
and
this
is
--
this
--
but
i
make
the
same
argument,
in
our
fourth
amendment
argument
about
arrest
without
warrant.
for
instance,
think
of
the
state
police.
in
orange
parish
alone,
the
police
make
a
thousand
arrests
a
week.
they
are
the
peacekeepers.
unlike
the
federal
police
agents
such
as
the
fbi
and
the
narcotics
agents
and
these
special
agents
who
have
very
limited
areas
who
do
not
cruise
the
city
in
police
cars,
who
do
not
have
to
pick
up
runaway
children,
that
is
one
thing.
but
peacekeeping
police
like
we
have
in
orleans
parish,
while
i
had
a
case
in
the
court
of
appeals
last
year
where
they
made
this
same
argument
about
a
warrant
you
needed
where
the
case
involved
a
mother
telling
the
police
that
her
child
was
a
runaway
and
she
had
good
reason
to
believe
that
her
child
was
staying
at
x
child’s
house.
so
the
police
went
there
and
knocked
on
the
door
and
asked
for
the
child
in
question
and
when
the
little
girl
of
the
house,
there
were
no
adults
in
the
house,
said,
the
little
girl
in
--
runaway
girl
was
not
there,
the
police
went
in
and
picked
her
up.
the
argument
was
made
that
they
should
have
gone
to
the
police
station
and
spent
two
days
swearing
out
a
warrant
and
this
is
just
one
of
the
many
examples.
what
i
mean
the
difference
between
a
state
police
which
has
a
problem
of
keeping
the
peace
and
federal
agents
which
have
an
entirely
different
role,
highly
specialized
role
where
they
probably
have
time
to
go
and
swear
out
a
warrant
because
the
man
they
are
pursuing
is
maybe
a
bank
robber
who
is
crossing
the
state
line
or
something
like
that.
but
–
so,
in
this
re-argument
before
this
court,
there
again,
i
think
that
history
shows
that
an
arrest
within
a
house
without
a
warrant
way
--
date
way
back
to
the
17th
century
in
england
in
semane's
(ph)
case,
on
probable
cause.
on
probable
cause
the
police
have
always
been
able
to
start
going
into
a
home
and
make
an
arrest.
ms.
louise
korns
yes,
your
honor,
i
am.
ms.
louise
korns
well
--
ms.
louise
korns
well,
i
gathered
from
reading
of
this
court’s
opinion
in
coolidge
versus
new
hampshire,
the
samurai,
that
the
majority
opinion
without
passing
on
the
question,
pointed
out
that
they
--
that
--i
think
mr.
justice
stewart
wrote
the
opinion,
point
out,
you
thought
that
to
allow
a
warrantless
entry
into
a
home
would
conflict
with
the
fourth
amendment,
but
my
answer
to
that
is
--
ms.
louise
korns
i
am
familiar
with
that.
ms.
louise
korns
right.
this
court
of
course
never
squarely
said.
it
did
call
that
the
exigent
circumstances,
that
is
right.
ms.
louise
korns
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
your
honor,
though
that
now
if
you
are
going
to
take
the
position
that
the
fourth
amendment
requires
a
warrant
to
seize
a
person
in
the
home,
i
see
no
difference
between
that
in
seizing
a
person
in
the
street.0
because
the
injury
to
the
person,
when
you
go
into
a
house
for
instance,
a
seizure
of
a
person
is
completely
different
from
rifling
through
drawers
and
desk
drawers
and
so
forth
for
things.
you
go
to
the
door
like
here
in
this
case
and
it
was
not
at
night,
it
was
at
daybreak.
it
was
at
6:15
to
6:30
in
the
morning.
now,
i
get
up
at
six
and
lots
of
people
get
up
at
six.
this
was
not
in
the
middle
of
the
night.
police
went
to
the
door,
knocked
on
the
door,
ms.
johnson
came,
they
announced
they
were
the
new
orleans
police
and
their
authority
and
their
purpose.
they
had
come
to
arrest
frank
johnson.
he
could
have
come
forward
to
the
door
as
he
was
legally
bound
to
do
and
surrendered
himself.
the
police
never
would
have
had
to
put
a
toe
in
the
door,
but
he
hid
under
the
bed.
now,
all
you
have
to
do
when
you
go
into
a
house
to
look
for
a
person
that
you
reasonably
believe
is
there,
you
know
how
to
go
through
all
the
desk
drawers
and
everything,
you
look
under
the
bed
he
is
hiding
or
a
closet,
just
open
the
door,
they
cannot
be
very
far
back
and
where
else
can
they
get?
that
is
not
like
tearing
everything
up
to
pieces
and
so
forth.
not
only
that,
as
i
say,
i
think
the
deprivation
of
liberty
is
not
the
picking
up
of
the
person
from
their
home,
if
you
are
going
to
look
at
it,
if
you
are
going
to
need
a
warrant,
then
why
do
you
not
need
a
warrant
to
pick
up
a
person
on
the
street?
you
are
going
to
take
him
to
jail
and
hold
him
until
their
lawyer
can
come
see
about
it
and
--
ms.
louise
korns
sir?
ms.
louise
korns
that
is
what
i
say.
as
i
see
it,
why
should
you
split
them
up?
you
either
have
to
say
that
you
have
to
have
a
warrant
for
every
arrest
or
you
do
not
have
to
have
a
warrant
for
arrest,
but
not
to
split
it
up
in
the
house
and
outside
the
house
as
i
see
it.
now,
it
is
apparent
from
mr.
buckley’s
argument
that
he
has
not
been
orleans
parish
in
the
past
few
years
because
right
now,
ever
since
we
argued
this
case
last
month,
i
had
been
taking
an
interest
in
jury
trials,
the
racial
composition
of
jury
trials
and
trying
to
figure
out
how
they
split
and
there
is
absolutely
no
pattern
to
them.
in
the
first
place,
there
are
at
least
five
points,
average
5.4
negroes
on
every
twelve-man
jury
in
orleans
parish
now
because
they
run
up
to
eight
in
some
juries
and
they
are
down
to
three
or
four
in
others,
but
they
--
that
five
or
six
average,
five
and
a
half
negroes
in
every
jury
so
they
can
well
take
care
of
themselves
if
they
need
three
votes
if
they
think
it.
there
is
case
after
case
where
the
victim
is
black,
the
accused
is
black,
they
have
six
black
jurors
and
six
whites
and
they
vote
ten
to
two,
six
blacks,
guilty
of
charged,
4
whites
guilty
as
charged,
two
whites,
not
guilty.
i
mean,
this
is
just
random
because
another
time
you
will
find
another
way,
but
there
is
absolutely
no,
nothing
to
show
that
the
blacks
have
to
protect
themselves
that
they
need
a
unanimous
verdict
to
protect
themselves
because
they
are
well
able
to
protect
themselves
right
now
and
generally
they
do
not
vote
in
a
racist
way.
ms.
louise
korns
nothing.
absolutely.
and
nothing,
absolutely
and
from
--
an
indications
of
what
is
have
studied
in
other
cases,
i
would
very
much
doubt
that
three
vote
--
jurors
voting
not
--
who
had
not
joined
the
guilty
vote,
it
does
not
mean
that
they
felt
they
were
not
guilty
as
--
and
our
brief
points
out,
if
they
have
sit
there
--
sat
there
long
enough,
there
is
a
95%
chance
they
would
have
reached
unanimity.
but
experience
shows
that
they
were
probably
a
mixture
of
black
and
white,
those
three.
they
might
have
been
all
white
even
or
they
might
of
course
been
black,
but
there
is
no
definite
pattern.
not
only
that,
i
think
your
honors
must
have
read
in
time
magazine
about
how
in
the
black
panther
trial
in
orleans
parish
last
july,
there
were
10
blacks,
2
whites,
unanimous,
not
guilty.
hewitt
nelson,
hewitt
nelson
got
a
hung
jury
in
oakland
and
when
the
jury
came
in
he
said,
oh!
this
proves
that
having
one
negro
on
a
jury
and
choosing
a
fair
trial,
but
who
was
the
--
who
hung
the
juror,
jury,
a
white
woman,
a
white
woman
hung
the
jury,
not
the
sole
black
woman
on
the
jury.
ms.
louise
korns
yes
your
honor.
it
was
just
because
mr.
buckley
was
arguing
this
point
that
i
brought
this
out.
ms.
louise
korns
well
i
agree
with
you,
i
agree
with
you.
it
was
just
an
answer
to
appellant’s
argument
that
i
wanted
to
point
out
that
i
do
think
is
that
--
ms.
louise
korns
no
sir.
ms.
louise
korns
no
well
i
--
i
frankly
admit.
i
know
from
experience
the
police
never
swear
out
an
arrest
warrant
in
orleans
parish
unless
the
person
is
a
fugitive
and
they
cannot
immediately
arrest
him
and
so
they
swear
out
the
warrant
to
send
to
another
parish
or
to
send
to
another
state.
but
never
in
a
case
like
this
do
the
police,
they
always
rely
on
louisiana
code
of
criminal
procedure,
article
213
and
they
just
never
come
to
searing
out
a
warrant
because
they
have
this
statutory
authority
to
arrest
without
a
warrant.
so,
is
there
any
question
the
court
would
like
to
ask
to
me
further?
then,
alright.
thank
you,
your
honor.
ms.
louise
korns
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
louise
korns
the
rule
at
common
law
was
--
as
i
see
it
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
under
semane's
case
in
england
that
there
was
no
need
for
a
warrant
at
all
to
enter
a
house.
at
common
law
there
never
has
been
a
need
if
--
there
has
to
be
probable
cause
of
course.
but
in
semane's
case
they
state
very
clearly
that
there
is
no
need
to
--
that
an
arrest
can
be
made
in
a
home
with
or
without
a
warrant
based
on
probable
cause.
and
all
the
english
commentators
point
out
that
the
rule
that
are
--
a
man’s
home
is
his
castle,
there
is
an
exception
to
this
rule
exist
in
the
case
of
arrest
that
no
man
can
--
no
man
has
as
a
castle
against
the
king.
so
actually
--
ms.
louise
korns
i
do
not
believe
so
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
believe
fourth
amendment
was
adopted
to
overrule
the
writs
of
assistance
and
the
general
warrants
--
ms.
louise
korns
--
which
were
completely
different
from
this.
now,
general
warrants
in
writs
of
assistance
were
issued
by
the
king,
the
writs
of
assistant
--
a
writ
of
assistance
was
given
by
the
king
to
one
of
his
favorites
to
run
for
the
life
of
the
king,
it
was
a
document
just
enabling
him
to
arrest
whomever
at
his
will
he
wanted
to.
there
had
--
did
not
have
to
be
any
probable
cause,
did
not
have
to
be
anything.
so,
how
can
you
possibly
liken
the
louisiana’s
code
of
--
louisiana
statute
permitting
a
writ
based
on
reasonable
cause
to
a
writ
of
assistance
which
was
a
blanket
writ
in
which
no
cause
at
all
had
to
exist.
ms.
louise
korns
no.
but
that
is
what
i
said,
it
could
not
be
that.
but
so
--
but
that
is
why
you
ask
me
if
i
--
if
possibly
the
fourth
amendment
was
drawn
up
to
prevent
the
rule,
the
common
law
rule
then
existing
from
being
in
existence
in
england
and
i
think
--
my
answer
is
that
is
absolutely
no.
i
think
it
was
directed
at
the
writs
of
assistant
--
writs
of
assistance
which
were
in
derogation
of
the
common
law
and
that
the
fourth
amendment
was
meant
to
ensure
that
the
common
law
existed
in
this
country
and
that
general
warrants
in
derogation
of
the
common
law
and
arrest
and
imprisonments
without
a
cause
could
not
exist.
ms.
louise
korns
well,
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
code
of
article
says
that
they
can
only
go
to
a
house
where
they
have
reasonable
cause
to
believe
the
person
to
be.
so
--
ms.
louise
korns
i
do
not
think
they
could
go
into
a
house
then.
they
have
to
get
a
reason
--
ms.
louise
korns
well,
they
would
have
to
test
it
the
same
way
they
test
any
unreasonable
searches
for
a
motion
to
suppress.
ms.
louise
korns
no,
well,
in
other
words
you
mean
if
the
man
was
illegally
arrested
and
no
evidence
was
seized,
that
i
do
not
know
how
you
would
test
it.
how
do
you
test
any,
or
how
do
you
test
anything?
ms.
louise
korns
well,
of
course,
we
take
--
we
took
the
position
that
--
the
accused
did
not
raise
this
point
in
the
district
court,
he
raises
for
the
first
time
on
appeal
so
–
ms.
louise
korns
yes,
well,
he
raised
--
he
--
in
the
supreme
court
he
argued
that
he
wanted
to
suppress
his
pretrial
identification.
ms.
louise
korns
by
a
motion
to
suppress.
however,
we
take
the
position
that
no
court
has
ever
held
that
a
pretrial
identification
is
something
subject
to
a
motion
to
suppress.
ms.
louise
korns
unless
he
filed
a
motion
--
unless
he
--
some
property
has
been
seized.
i
will
argue
that
--
ms.
louise
korns
he
could
file
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
i
imagine.
but
generally,
you
see,
the
reason
i
am
puzzled
by
this
--
ms.
louise
korns
well,
he
could
at
--
now
that
i
am
thinking
of
--
he
can
ask
for
a
preliminary
hearing
immediately
.he
can
ask
to
be
brought
before
a
magistrate
and
have
a
preliminary
hearing
immediately
in
which
the
state
has
to
show
probable
cause
to
hold
him.
that
is
--
i
am
sorry,
that
is
what
he
can
do
certainly.
so
if
the
court
would
not
care
about
further
questions
and
thank
you,
your
honors.
ms.
louise
korns
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
beginning
of
my
argument,
i'd
like
to
inquire
whether
it
would
be
possible
maybe
to
have
a
little
more
time
in
view
of
--
than
the
regular
half
hour
in
view
of
the
two
very
important
questions
posed
by
this
case,
but
i'll
certainly
leave.
ms.
louise
korns
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
louise
korns
certainly,
your
honor.
to
begin
with
on
the
jury
question,
the
first
question
in
the
case,
just
to
touch
briefly
on
the
historical
background
of
a
majority
jury
verdict
system.
as
this
court
knows,
various
theories
have
been
advanced
to
explain
why
unanimous
jury
verdicts
became
required
in
many
jurisdictions,
particularly
in
england,
up
until
1967
between
the
18th
century,
about
1967.
and,
chief
--
lord
justice
devlin,
i
think
most
writers
concede
that
lord
justice
devlin's
theory
that
it
was
purely
by
chance
is
the
correct
theory.
as
lord
justice
devlin
and
i
think
professor
fayer
(ph)
also
in
the
harvard
law
review
point
out,
during
the
middle
ages
in
england,
a
trial
by
compurgation
there
was
the
custom
of
a
party
having
to
have
his
oaths
--
his
version
of
the
facts
supported
by
the
oath
of
12
jurors.
so,
they
would
assemble
12
compurgators.
if
these
12
compurgators
couldn't
support
the
oath
of
the
party,
they'd
keep
adding
to
him
and
adding
to
him
until,
finally,
out
of
who
knows
how
many
number,
100,
they
had
12
men
swearing
to
the
position
of
one
party,
and
then
he
won
the
case.
just
to
skip
briefly
over,
it
is
the
function
of
the
jury
ran
in
the
12th
century
gradually
changed
to
judging
credibility
rather
than
swearing
to
it.
the
practice
of
adding
extra
jurors
was
eliminated,
but
the
requirement
that
the
crown
obtained
12
votes
to
convict
was
kept
and,
therefore,
as
mr.
justice
devlin
points
out,
the
unanimity
requirement
grew
out
of
a
majority
system
of
jury
verdicts
in
which
at
least
12
votes
were
needed
to
support
a
verdict
out
of
an
untold
number.
now
at
the
present
time,
as
this
court
knows,
majority
verdicts
exist
not
only
in
six
states
in
this
country,
as
well
as
puerto
rico,
but
in
many
--
in
countries
which
formally
were
part
of
the
british
commonwealth,
notably,
it
had
existed
in
scotland
8-7
verdict
for
time
immemorial
and
worked
very
well.
and
england,
as
this
court
knows,
in
1967
adopted
in
the
criminal
justice
act
of
that
year,
adopted
majority
verdicts
in
criminal
trials.
specifically,
the
law
requires
that
where
a
jury
consists
of
not
more
than
11,
10
can
bring
in
a
verdict.
where
a
jury
consists
of
not
more
than
10,
nine
can
bring
in
a
verdict
provided
that
a
verdict
of
guilty
cannot
be
brought
in
by
a
majority
verdict
unless
the
jury
has
deliberated
at
least
two
hours.
i
think
this
court
is
familiar
with
the
fact
that,
in
england,
jurors
drop
out
during
the
trial
rather
than
alternate
jurors,
but
that's
immaterial
and
i
won't
go
into
that
point.
as
this
court
also
knows,
because
it
pointed
out
in
williams
versus
florida,
we
had
majority
verdicts
in
colonial
times
in
a
number
of
states,
notably
pennsylvania,
connecticut,
and
the
carolinas
i
think.
as
this
court
also
pointed
out
in
williams
versus
florida,
it
rejected
in
fact
in
williams
versus
florida
the
argument
that
every
feature
of
the
common
law
jury,
as
it
existed,
at
the
time
our
constitution
was
growing
up
was
incorporated
in
our
constitution
every
time
the
word
“jury”
is
mentioned.
this
court
rejected
that
and
pointed
out
that,
as
originally
submitted
by
mr.
james
madison
in
the
house
--
to
the
house
and
as
originally
adopted
by
the
house,
the
jury
amendment
required
that,
among
other
things,
the
jury
–
a
verdict
must
be
unanimous.
that
it
passed
the
house
this
way
was
rejected
in
the
senate
and,
as
ultimately
adopted,
the
sixth
amendment
only
said
that
in
a
criminal
trial,
an
accused
is
entitled
to
trial
by
jury,
what
kind,
and
impartial
jury.
it
doesn't
mention
the
number
or
whether
it
has
to
be
unanimous.
now,
we
get
right
down
to
the
issue
in
this
case
as
i
see
it,
as
was
posed
by
this
court
in
a
footnote
in
williams
in
which
it
said
it
took
no
stand
on
whether
a
majority
verdict
violated
due
process.
and,
as
this
--
as
louisiana
sees
it,
the
issue
is
very
simple.
whether
the
use
by
a
state
of
a
majority
verdict
in
a
criminal
trial
violates
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
it
infringes
the
principle
that
a
person
accused
of
crime
cannot
be
convicted
except
upon
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
every
fact
necessary
to
constitute
the
crime.
that
is
the
issue
for
decision
as
far
as
louisiana
sees
it.
as
louisiana
sees
it,
the
equal
protection
argument
is
really
subordinate
and
not
important
because
if
in
fact
a
majority
verdict
satisfies
due
process,
as
we
think
it
does,
the
equal
protection
question
really
goes
out
of
the
picture
because,
as
soon
as
everyone
similarly
situated
is
treated
as
the
way
the
appellant
here
was,
that
is,
everybody
in
louisiana
accused
of
a
crime
for
which
the
punishment
is
necessarily
hard
labor
is
treated
the
same
way
as
we
see
it,
the
crucial
question
is
whether
a
majority
jury
verdict
satisfies
or
violates
due
process
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
that
to
us,
is
the
crux.
ms.
louise
korns
well
--
ms.
louise
korns
well,
actually,
the
truth
is,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
as
i
studied
this
case
and
evaluated
it,
i
arrived
at
that
conclusion.
i
just
express
because
as
we
--
i'll
show
later
in
the
argument,
there's
no
difference
in
the
percentage
of
convictions
between
cases
tried
by
majority
verdict
and
cases
tried
by
unanimous
verdict,
and
that
would
be
the
crux
of
any
unequal
protection
argument.
as
i
see
it,
what
can
an
accused
argue
on
his
equal
protection
argument,
unless
he
can
say
“look,
i
have
a
10
or
15
or
20%
greater
chance
of
being
convicted
by
a
majority
verdict
than
another
person
in
my
state
has
who
is
accused
of
another
type
of
crime.”
as
i
see
it,
that's
the
only
type
of
unequal
protection
argument
you
can
make.
ms.
louise
korns
yes,
your
honor?
ms.
louise
korns
well,
right
there,
there
would
be
a
monetary
loss
to
the
person
who
had
to
buy
the
license,
if
nothing
else.
but,
our
position
in
this
case,
there
is
no
loss
to
the
accused
about
--
by
being
tried
by
a
majority
rather
than
a
unanimous
verdict.
so,
i
don't
--
excuse
me,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
don't
think
the
argument
is
parallel
in
the
view
of
the
position
we
take
because,
certainly
if
one
person
had
to
pay
$10
for
a
license
then
another
person
had
to
pay
$20,
right
there
is
the
difference
of
$10,
somebody's
being
hurt
$10.
ms.
louise
korns
well,
there
again,
in
the
alternative
i'd
say
it
wasn't,
right.
on
the
alternative
i'd
say
it
wasn't,
but
right
at
the
beginning
we
say
that
in
louisiana
--
that
every
--
all
the
study
i've
been
doing
on
this
case,
since
i
first
started
working
on
this
brief,
convinces
me
more
and
more
that
there
is
absolutely
no
higher
rate
of
conviction
in
jurisdictions
in
cases
tried
by
majority
verdict
than
in
unanimous
verdict
cases,
and
i'll
explain
to
the
court
why
when
i
get
into
the
analyzing
the
way
a
jury
arrives
at
its
verdict
as
mrs.
kalven
&
zeisel
had
pointed
out
in
their
brief.
ms.
louise
korns
if
the
jury
in
louisiana
brings
in
a
verdict
of
guilty
without
capital
punishment,
technically,
the
accused
is
sentenced
to
prison
for
life,
but
life,
life
i
think
--
i'm
not
sure
what
life
means,
mr.
justice
marshall,
but
it
doesn't
mean
natural
life.
ms.
louise
korns
as
we'll
point
out,
mr.
justice
marshall,
he
has
about
1%
less
chance,
about
1%,
and
when
you
go
into
the
convictions
on
retrial,
that's
a
whole
second
point
in
our
brief,
it's
immaterial
on
a
practical
basis.
there
is
really
--
and
the
more
you
study
it,
the
more
you
--
ms.
louise
korns
well,
that's
a
good
question
and
my
position
is
the
more
i
study
it,
i
think
it's
purely
psychological
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
wouldn't
see
any
difference.
i
don't
think
if
you
allow
a
9
out
of
12
verdict,
there
would
be
any
higher
conviction
right
and
the
only
trouble
with
having
a
9
out
of
12
jury
involving
--
when
a
jury
has
to
bring
in
a
death
sentence
is
that,
perhaps
because
death
and
putting
someone
to
death
fills
people
with
guilt
and
awe,
it
may
be
that
9
wouldn't
act
if
12
held
out
as
they
will
just
for
punishment
because
of
the
finality,
but
that's
the
only
difference
i
see
because,
as
i
will
show
in
my
second
point
in
this
argument,
there
is
no
difference
--
when
you
study
the
question
and
you'll
see
how
juries
operate,
there
is
no
difference
between
the
conviction
rate
when
the
verdict
is
a
majority
verdict
or
when
it's
a
unanimous
verdict.
it's
--
see,
in
england,
when
they
went
--
i
studied
lots
of
english
materials
in
writing
this
brief.
mr.
roy
jenkins,
he
was
home
secretary
and
who
pushed
the
majority
verdict
through
parliament
because
he
was
so
convinced
it
would
help
the
administration
of
justice
in
england,
he
states
and
his
arguments
are
summarized
in
these
various
british
journals
that
i've
cite
in
my
brief,
he
stated
in
the
house
of
commons
or
someone
stated
for
him
that
he
was
sure
that
the
innocent
would
not
suffer
for
this,
and
he
pointed
to
the
time
honored
practice
in
scotland
of
brining
in
a
criminal
verdicts
by
8-7,
15-man
jury,
8
can
convict.
and,
he
pointed
out
that,
certainly,
in
scotland
nobody
had
ever
complained
that
there
was
--
that
the
innocent
suffered
or
that
there
was
any
discrimination
against
an
accused
because
he
was
convicted
by
8
out
of
15
men.
ms.
louise
korns
only
in
duncan,
it
was
attacked
on
the
basis
that
we
allow
trials
before
judges
when
the
punishment
could
be
up
to
two
years,
and
we
lost
that
case.
and,
this
court
said
we
had
to
have
juries
for
anything
over
--
for
any
serious
crime
which,
in
ballwin,
this
court
narrowed
down
to
six
months.
but,
actually,
after
we
lost
duncan,
we
then
amended
our
laws
to
have
everybody
either
to
bring
down
the
punishment
to
six
months
or
to
allow
a
jury
trial
in
anything
over
six
months.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
the
first
part
of
our
constitutional
provision
here
which
is
set
out
on
pages
324
of
louisiana's
brief
is
that
all
trials
in
misdemeanor
cases
shall
be
by
judges,
but
then
we
had
sentences
up
to
two
years.
therefore,
this
court's
decision
in
duncan
cut
across
that
first
provision
of
our
constitution
which
goes
on
and
says
“you
see,
it's
very
logical
the
way
the
con
--
the
way
the
legislature
set
it
up
in
1898.”
they
said
all
misdemeanors
shall
be
by
a
judge
alone.
all
crimes
which
may
be
punished
by
hard
labor
shall
be
by
a
five-man
jury,
all
of
whom
must
concur.
all
crimes
which
shall
be
punished
by
hard
labor,
which
is
the
instant
one,
shall
be
by
a
12-man
jury,
9
of
whom
must
concur.
all
capital
crimes
shall
be
by
a
12-man
jury,
all
of
whom
must
concur.
that's
the
way
we
set
it
up
and
that's
the
way
it
still
is,
except
for
the
duncan
provision
that
cuts
across
the
trial
of
misdemeanors
if
more
than
--
a
sentence
of
more
than
six
months
can
be
imposed.
ms.
louise
korns
no,
we
have
never
had
it.
this
is
res
nova.
this
is
it
right
here,
and
that's
why
i
say
this
is
very
important
for
louisiana,
this
case
and
this
point.
ms.
louise
korns
well,
i
don't
think
it
does,
your
honor.
in
the
alternative,
that's
my
second
point,
but
just
to
--
you
see,
the
whole
picture
of
the
appellant's
case
has
been
here
and
that's
why
i
researched
this
so
carefully.
their
whole
case
has
been
locked.
we've
been
denied
due
process
of
law
because
we
had
a
much
greater
chance
to
be
convicted
than
somebody
tried
by
unanimous
jury
or
a
five-man
juries.
and
so,
since
that
was
a
pitch
of
their
argument,
this
is
what
i
researched
and
built
up,
i
agree
with
you.
in
england,
for
instance,
they
say
“well,
what
we
want
to
do
is
catch
the
guilty
people.”
they're
very
frank
about
it
you
see,
and
i
don't
see
any
harm
as
long
as
you're
not
unfair
in
trying
to
convict
criminals
and
put
them
where
society
intends
them
to
be.
but,
to
get
back
to
the
due
process
argument,
your
honors,
this
is
--
ms.
louise
korns
i
beg
your
pardon?
ms.
louise
korns
when?
in
1967.
ms.
louise
korns
it
had
been
unanimous
from
about
--
ms.
louise
korns
--
the
13th
century
when,
as
i
say,
mr.
justice
devlin
said
it
developed
by
chance.
and,
from
19
--
13th
century
up
until
the
20th,
of
course,
it
existed
at
the
time
the
american
colonies
were
formed
and
that's
why
it's
clothed
in
this
sort
of
mythical
status
in
this
country.
as
i
say,
when
you
tear
all
fiction
and
fantasy
aside
though,
there
is
no
harm
to
the
accused
and
a
lot
of
help
to
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
from
using
a
majority
verdict
system.
ms.
louise
korns
exactly.
ms.
louise
korns
exactly.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
you
read
about
why
mr.
james
madison's
jury
amendment
ran
into
so
much
trouble
in
the
senate,
that's
exactly
why
it
ran
into
trouble
in
the
senate.
ms.
louise
korns
no,
actually
--
ms.
louise
korns
the
only
way
you
can
say
--
the
only
logical
argument
a
person
can
make
about
needing
a
unanimous
jury
requirement
in
capital
--
in
criminal
trials
is
only
two
arguments
they
can
make,
as
i
see
it.
one
is
the
argument
which
this
court
rejected
in
williams
versus
florida,
that
is
an
--
but
which
the
court
had
sort
of
sanctioned
in
earlier
cases,
but
which
it
repudiated
in
williams
versus
florida
and
that
is,
that
the
jury
as
it
existed
at
common
law
in
england
at
the
time
our
constitution
was
drafted
is
the
jury
that
the
drafters
of
the
constitution
had
in
mind.
this
court
rejected
that
idea
in
williams
when
they
rejected
the
12-man
jury
because
at
the
time
the
englishmen
founded
--
settled
american
colonies,
they
had
a
12-man
unanimous
jury,
that
was
rejected
in
williams.
now,
the
only
other
argument
you
can
make
is
“look,
i
stand
an
unfair
chance
of
being
convicted
under
this
type
of
jury
system.”
somehow,
rather,
i'm
going
to
be
convicted.
i'm
not
going
to
--“
see,
they
all
get
that
the
reasonable
doubt
standard
is
violated,
and
this
court
held
in
in
re
winship
that
the
fact
that
an
accused
had
to
be
convinced
by
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
was
part
of
the
due
process.
so,
that's
the
crux
of
their
argument.
if
they're
9
out
of
--
if
a
9-3
verdict
comes
in,
it
means
that
3
men
doubted
and
the
burden
of
proof
hasn't
been
carried.
well,
the
flaw
in
that
argument
is
this.
this
jury
came-in
in
20
minutes,
to
answer
the
question
of
mr.
justice
stewart
i
think,
in
20
minutes.
i
surmise
that
they
must
have
gone
out,
elected
their
foreman,
and
it
was
a
first-to-second
ballot,
they
came-in
in
20
minutes.
statistic
show
in
this
kalven
&
zeisel's
study
of
the
american
jury
with
which
this
court
is
familiar,
i
know
because
they
--
this
court
cited
it
in
the
williams
versus
florida,
study
show
that
any
jury
and
the
american
jury,
this
book,
includes
majority
verdicts
so
it
includes
louisiana
juries.
any
jury
with
deliberate
juror
--
when
a
jury
deliberates
long
enough,
it
will
reach
unanimity
in
95%
of
the
case.
they
say
that
over
and
over
again.
that's
why
in
the
present
case,
there's
no
--
there
was
a
95%
chance
if
this
jury
had
not
come
back
into
the
courtroom
at
the
end
of
20
minutes
with
a
9-3
verdict
of
guilty,
there's
a
95%
chance
that
if
they
had
sat
there
long
enough
it
would've
reached
unanimity.
there
is
no
chance
in
louisiana's
view
that
it
would've
acquitted
the
accused
because
kalven
&
zeisel
show
in
their
book
that
once
a
majority,
a
great
majority
develops
like
9-3
it
is
almost
impossible
for
the
minority
to
persuade
the
majority.
they
say
only
with
extreme
infrequency
does
a
minority
persuade
the
majority
to
change
its
mind.
ms.
louise
korns
see,
they
--
i
agree
with
you,
mr.
justice
black,
but
i'm
just
trying
to
answer
their
questions.
they
were
arguments
they
made
to
say
why
this
court
should
set
aside.
they
claim
that
it's
because
the
reasonable
doubt
principle
is
infringed,
there's
a
higher
chance
of
their
being
convicted,
and
so
i
just
answered
their
questions.
i'll
agree
with
you.
i
don't
think
it
is.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
ms.
louise
korns
well,
this
court
decided
in
williams
that
12
was
not
needed.
that's
what
this
court
decided
in
williams
and
this
court
then
went
on
to
point
out
that
five-man
jury
it
did
not
think
--
it
thought
it
was
large
enough.
well,
in
the
first
place,
it
said
a
jury
has
satisfied
the
requirement
which
is
the
primary
requirement
of
jury
trials,
that
a
body
of
laymen
be
interposed
between
the
government
and
the
accused
as
a
protection
against
tyranny.
the
body
and
the
five
men
they
said
and
you
all
--
this
court
said
that
williams
satisfied
and
certainly,
12-man
jury,
9
of
whom
must
concur
to
render
a
verdict
certainly
serve
the
same
function.
it
serves
as
a
shield
between
the
government
and
the
accused,
that
keeps
the
government
from
oppressing
the
citizen
by
standing
there
as
a
body
of
impartial
laymen.
and,
one
of
--
a
member
of
this
court
asked,
i
think
it
was
mr.
justice
black,
does
a
federal
jury
have
to
be
unanimous.
i
say,
it
doesn't
and
the
proof
is
that
they
had
to
enact
a
statute
to
make
it
that
way.
in
other
words,
if
the
constitution
just
was
clear,
you
know,
even
almost
clear,
that
a
jury
had
to
be
unanimous,
why
would
the
federal
--
why
would
us
code
provide
that
it
had
to
be
unanimous?
ms.
louise
korns
the
constitution
only
said
that,
in
all
criminal
trials,
the
sixth
amendment,
the
accused
is
entitled
to
a
trial
by
an
impartial
jury
and
that's
all
it
says,
an
impartial
jury
of
the
neighborhood
in
which
the
crime
occurred,
that's
all
the
constitution
said.
and,
the
unanimity
and
12-man
requirements
which
were
originally
in
the
sixth
amendment,
as
this
court
noticed
from
williams,
was
struck
--
was
stricken
out
in
--
by
the
senate
and
as
adopted.
in
other
words,
the
draft
is
rejected,
both
the
12-man
and
the
unanimity.
ms.
louise
korns
well,
you
see
--
ms.
louise
korns
but
you
see,
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
fallacy
of
that
argument
is
that
this
jury
would've.
there
was
a
95%
chance
of
this
jury
becoming
that
way,
and
when
you
study
the
way
juries
reach
unanimity,
you
understand
more
what
i
mean.
kalven
&
zeisel
say
that
--
ms.
louise
korns
right,
that's
right.
exactly,
that's
his
argument.
ms.
louise
korns
that's
his
argument.
ms.
louise
korns
they're
not
in
the
constitution
but
they
say--
ms.
louise
korns
right.[attempt
to
laughter]
their
theory
that
they
document
is
that
the
jury
makes
up
its
mind
in
the
courtroom
and
actually,
if
you
adopt
this,
brazil
has
the
right
way
of
doing
it.
in
brazil,
the
jurors
listen
to
the
case,
they
walk
out
and,
by
written
ballot,
they
write
guilty
or
innocent.
no
deliberation,
and
the
accused
is
--
and
the
majority
verdict
decides.
now,
kalven
&
zeisel
also
throw
grave
doubt
on
the
whole
deliberation
process
of
the
jury.
they
point
out
that
the
first
vote
of
the
jury
out
of
the
room
determines
the
end
vote,
and
they
show
it
time
and
again.
and,
they
say
the
deliberation
process
is
only
their
arriving
at
a
consensus
and
actually
louisiana
says
the
same
sorts
of
pressures,
only
more
subtle,
now
operate
to
produce
unanimity
in
a
jury
as
operated.
as
this
court
knows,
in
the
middle
ages
they
were
locked
up
without
food,
drink,
fire,
or
candle.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
even
took
them
by
court
to
the
next
circuit
when
they
went
if
the
jurors
hadn't
made
up
their
mind.
ms.
louise
korns
certainly
not
[attempt
to
laughter]
certainly
not,
mr.
justice
black.
they
argue
from
that,
though,
kalven
&
zeisel
show
that
the
same
sorts
of
pressure
is
exerted
on
juries
now
they
are
more
subtle
and
psychological
naturally.
he
points
out
that
if
--
that
the
minority
always
gives
into
the
majority
--
no,
95%
of
the
time,
the
minority
gives
into
the
majority
just
because
they
lose
ground
and
so
forth
and
the
minority
never
turns
the
majority
around,
never.
so,
what's
the
use
of
any
deliberation
be
--
once
you
establish,
say
nine
votes.
reach
nine
votes
and
come
out,
they
are
never
going
to
turn
around
and
acquit
that
man
when
nine
of
them
think
he's
guilty.
the
most
the
accused
can
hope
for
is
a
hung
jury.
ms.
louise
korns
from
that
jury,
right.
ms.
louise
korns
well,
right,
but
they
get
the
new
trial,
mr.
justice
stewart,
and
there
are
no
figures
to
show
what
the
rate
of
convictions
are
on
the
new
trial.
ms.
louise
korns
some
people
think
they
are
higher
and
some
people
think
they
are
lower,
but
they're
at
least
we
can
assume,
they're
going
to
be
a
certain
number
of
convictions
on
a
new
trial.
so,
what
does
he
get,
but
a
faint
hope
that,
on
a
new
trial,
he
might
get
a
convic
--
an
acquittal.
his
point
is
that,
right
in
line
of
what
you've
told
us,
that
once
nine
people
are
against
him,
he
is
cut
from
that
jury,
but
if
you
require
unanimity
he
wouldn't
be
because
he'd
get
at
least
a
hung
jury--
ms.
louise
korns
exactly.
ms.
louise
korns
right,
exactly.
that's
all
he
can
hope
for.
there's
[attempt
to
laughter]
no
doubt
about
it.
ms.
louise
korns
right,
the
95%
chance
that
they'll
persuade
the
3,
95%
chance,
right.
ms.
louise
korns
that's
from
kalven
&
zeisel,
right.
[attempt
to
laughter]
ms.
louise
korns
he
used
kalven
&
zeisel
first,
mr.
justice
stewart.
they
base
their
whole
case
on
kalven
&
zeisel.
so,
i've
got
to
study
kalven
&
zeisel,
or
else
the
rope
is
around
my
neck,
as
it
were,
because
--
ms.
louise
korns
right,
exactly.
just
briefly,
i'd
like
to
remind
this
court
of
everything
that
is
saved
by
a
12-man
jury,
i
mean,
a
majority
verdict.
although
the
majority--that's
the
second
part
in
our
brief,
that
although
the
majority
verdict
only
ultimately
affects
the
verdict
in
a
tiny
minority
of
cases
because
as
i
pointed
out,
they
would
reach
unanimity
and
so
forth,
it
saves
time
in
every
case.
like
in
this
case,
the
jury
came-in
in
20
minutes.
it
reduces
the
danger
of
mistrial
by
about
2%
and
really,
it
was
because
of
this
that
england
--
as
you
read
these
english
materials,
you'll
see
that
the
home
secretary
pressed
this
new
law
because
england
had
been
having
a
lot
of
trouble
with
what
they
call
“nobbling.”
nobbling
is
the
intimidation
or
bribing
of
jurors
to
prevent
a
unanimous
verdict.
and,
as
they
pointed
out,
it
just
wastes
time,
money,
and
judge
power
to
have
to
spend,
especially
in
a
long
case
like
the
manson
case,
supposing
they
had
had
a
mistrial.
well,
anyway,
it
just
saves
time,
money,
and
judge
power
to
have
a
majority
verdict.
ms.
louise
korns
yes?
ms.
louise
korns
i'll
do
that.
ms.
louise
korns
so
you
don't
want
to
give
us
any
more
time
then.
ms.
louise
korns
alright,
fine.
i'll
go
on
to
the
other
point.
well,
my
other
point
is
just
that
we
don't
see
that
there
has
been
any
argument
at
all
that
can
be
made
for
getting
a
warrant
to
make
an
arrest
in
a
home.
the
home
has
never
been
a
sanctuary
against
arrest
ever.
at
common
law
what
simmons
(ph)
case
said
the
privilege
of
the
house
does
not
run
against
the
king,
never
has
a
home
--
this
is
the
one
exception
to
the
principle
that
a
man's
home
is
his
castle.
the
one
exception,
it
cuts
right
across
it,
is
that
a
man
--
the
privilege
of
a
man's
house
does
not
run
against
the
king,
in
other
words,
translated
--
ms.
louise
korns
right,
no
doubt
about
it.
i
agree
[attempt
to
laughter]
with
you,
but
you
don't
have
to
have
a
warrant,
right.
at
common
law,
there's
no
doubt
about
it,
mr.
justice
white.
arrest
could
be
made
without
a
warrant
in
a
house
based
on
probable
cause.
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
a
practical
matter.
i
call
this
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that,
in
all
his
powers,
the
police
make
about
50,000-55,000
arrests
a
year.
i'd
say
100
or
1,000
a
week
with
a
--
well,
as
this
court
--
i
just
went
in
to
this
before
this
court
in
vale,
the
length
of
time
it
takes
to
make
out
an
arrest
warrant,
to
type
that
probable
cause
to
--
ms.
louise
korns
very
few,
mr.
justice
marshall.
in
fact
--
ms.
louise
korns
no,
it's
just
that's
the
only
way
the
court
can
operate
--
the
police
can
operate.
they
only
make
out
arrest
warrants.
they
never
--
you
see,
we
have
an
article
213,
the
code
of
criminal
procedure.
this
is
an
article
that
all
jurisdictions
have.
it's
a
codification
of
the
common
law.
the
federal
agents,
various
ones,
they
have
no
broad
statute
like
our
article
213
because
they
don't
have
general
peace
keeping
power.
but,
the
fbi,
the
narcotics
agents,
the
united
states
marshals,
the
selective
service
among
others
have
the
right
by
statute
upon
a
showing
--
when
they
have
a
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
a
crime's
been
committed,
to
make
an
arrest
without
a
warrant,
and
all
jurisdictions
have
this
law
like
213
and
as
a
practical
matter,
the
police
couldn't
operate.
they'd
have
to
double
the
police
force
if
they
had
to
swear
out
55,000
arrest
warrants
a
year.
ms.
louise
korns
no,
the
search
is
immaterial,
mr.
justice
marshall.
ms.
louise
korns
well,
six
men
always
go
to
an
armed
robber's
house.
they
do.
ms.
louise
korns
right,
because
he's
an
armed
robber.
ms.
louise
korns
well,
see,
they
went
to
the
--
ms.
louise
korns
well,
i
don't
think
--
ms.
louise
korns
well,
they
knocked
on
the
door.
they
didn't
have
to
force
their
way
in.
ms.
louise
korns
yes,
they
knocked.
ms.
louise
korns
no,
they
knocked
and
introduced
themselves
and
explained
their
reason
to
be
there
ms.
louise
korns
it
was
ms.
johnson
who
came
to
the
door.
ms.
louise
korns
it
was
--
mr.
johnson
was
under
the
bed.
ms.
johnson
came
to
the
door.
[laughter]
mr.
johnson
got
under
the
bed.
ms.
louise
korns
yes,
they
found
him
under
the
bed.
the
po
--
ms.
louise
korns
would
the
court
like
to
hear
the
facts
of
the
case?
ms.
louise
korns
thank
you.
ms.
louise
korns
yes,
i
remember
that.
ms.
louise
korns
it
was
called
--
i
remember
it.
ms.
louise
korns
that
is
true,
it
does.
i've
forgotten
the
name
of
that
cast.
ms.
louise
korns
thank
you.
ms.
louise
korns
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue,
the
decision,
two
issues
for
decision
before
this
court
today
are
clearly
of
whether
louisiana
is
going
to
be
allowed
to
keep
nine
out
of
twelve
jurors
and
its
right
to
arrest
a
man
in
a
home
on
probable
cause
without
a
warrant.
ms.
louise
korns
well,
we
have
a
statutory
right,
mr.
justice
stewart
under
louisiana
code
of
criminal
procedure
article,
the
louisiana
police
have
the
right
to
make
an
arrest
upon
probable
cause.
it
is
sort
of
like
federal
statutes,
only
it
is
a
broad
statute.
instead
of
like
a
federal
statutes
saying
narcotics
agents
can
make
arrest
without
--
we
have
set
out
in
our
brief,
we
have
various
articles
of
the
criminal
code,
louisiana
criminal
code
saying
that
police
officers
may
arrest
for
a
crime
when
reasonable
cause
exists
to
believe
that
a
crime
has
been
committed,
it
being
committed
and
so
forth.
and
then
an
another
article
right
after
that
says
that
an
arrest
maybe
made
anytime,
any
place
and
instead
article
says,
these
are
all
set
out
in
the
second
part
of
our
brief
where
we
discussed
this
on
page
21
of
our
brief,
that
the
police
may
enter
any
dwelling
to
make
an
arrest
if
first,
they
announced
their
authority
and
purpose
and
then
if
they
are
a
denied
entry
they
may
break
the
door.
in
our
brief,
louisiana
took
position
and
takes
a
position
that
both
that
our
jury
is
alright
under
the
sixth
amendment
and
that
our
statutory
laws
permitting
arrest
in
the
home
without
warrant
is
valid
under
the
fourth
amendment.
however,
in
the
alternative
in
this
oral
argument,
i
would
like
to
advance
this
further
alternative
argument.
that
if
this
court
should
hold
that
a
nine
to
twelve
jury
is
not
permissible
under
the
sixth
amendment
and
an
arrest
in
the
home
without
warrant
is
not
valid
under
the
fourth
amendment,
but
nevertheless
both
of
these
actions
are
valid
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
that
the
state
should
be
permitted
to
follow
them,
even
though
the
federal
government
cannot
and
i
say
this
for
these
reason.
i
realize
that
in
making
this
argument
i
have
to
ask
the
court
not
really
to
overrule,
but
to
modify
in
these
two
areas.
it
is
a
holding
that
it
has
had
gradually
been
developing
during
these
past
years
as
it
selectively
incorporated
various
guarantees
of
the
bill
of
rights
into
the
fourteenth
amendment.
along
with
it
this
court
i
think
has
also
up
until
the
present
time
fairly
much
held
that
that
once
--
that
although
--
it
has
never
held,
this
--
a
majority
of
this
court
has
never
held
that
the
bill
of
rights
was
automatically
incorporated
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
however,
i
think
that
the
majority
of
this
court
has
increasingly
been
holding
that
once
this
court
finds
that
a
guarantee
in
the
bill
of
rights
applies
to
the
states
through
the
fourteenth
amendment
then
every
facet,
every
constitutional
standard
of
the
--
the
constitutional
standard
applying
against
the
state
government
and
the
federal
government
are
the
same.
i
believe
i
am
right
there.
now,
i
was
very
much
impressed
in
restudying
this
case
for
re-argument
with
mr.
justice
fortas'
concurring
opinion
in
duncan.
and
thus
i
what
i
say
in
--
although
our
primary
position
is
that
a
non-unanimous
jury
is
permissible
under
the
sixth
amendment
because
of
everything
we
set
out
in
our
brief,
of
the
unanimity
principle
being
deleted,
the
fact
that
four
of
the
original
13
states
had
majority
verdicts,
the
fact
that
many
common
law
jurisdictions
with
juries
presently
have
majority
verdicts
such
as
scotland,
england,
went
to
it
in
1967
and
so
forth.
so
our
first
position
is
that
a
majority
verdict
jury
is
valid
under
sixth
amendment.
in
the
alternative
we
say
that
if
this
court
should
hold
that
it
is
not,
it
was
not
the
intent
of
the
framers
that
that
the
federal
courts
used
juries
which
returned
less
than
unanimous
verdicts,
we
nevertheless
alternatively
take
the
position
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
majority
verdict
that
violates
a
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
we
ask
this
court
as
mr.
justice
fortas
very,
very
intelligently
pointed
out
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
duncan,
a
jury
trial
is
not
a
principle
of
justice
like
self
incrimination
and
the
first
amendment
right.
it
is
rather
a
system
of
procedure
and
he
pointed
out
that
he
thought
that
if
this
court
insisted
that
the
states
and
the
federal
government
be
--
with
down
to
every
single
detail
identical
that
we
would
have
rigidity,
conformism
that
we
would
--
it
would
go
against
our
principle
of
federalism,
they
would
prevent
us
from
being
able
to
try
out
one
thing
in
one
jurisdiction
and
another
thing
in
another
jurisdiction
and
he
thought
that
this
would
have
a
very
adverse
effect
on
our
whole
principle
of
federalism.
and
i
think
mr.
justice,
the
late
mr.
justice
harlan,
pointed
out
in
his
concur
--
dissenting
opinion
in
williams
this
very
the
same
thing.
he
said
that
he
thought
that
this
court
should
reexamine
its
whole
--
the
whole
principle
of
incorporation
because
he
said
if
it
did
not,
that
he
thought
there
was
going
to
be
a
labeling
and
rigid
process
that
was
going
to
set
in
making
all
the
50
states
with
their
different
problems
and
this
is
--
this
--
but
i
make
the
same
argument,
in
our
fourth
amendment
argument
about
arrest
without
warrant.
for
instance,
think
of
the
state
police.
in
orange
parish
alone,
the
police
make
a
thousand
arrests
a
week.
they
are
the
peacekeepers.
unlike
the
federal
police
agents
such
as
the
fbi
and
the
narcotics
agents
and
these
special
agents
who
have
very
limited
areas
who
do
not
cruise
the
city
in
police
cars,
who
do
not
have
to
pick
up
runaway
children,
that
is
one
thing.
but
peacekeeping
police
like
we
have
in
orleans
parish,
while
i
had
a
case
in
the
court
of
appeals
last
year
where
they
made
this
same
argument
about
a
warrant
you
needed
where
the
case
involved
a
mother
telling
the
police
that
her
child
was
a
runaway
and
she
had
good
reason
to
believe
that
her
child
was
staying
at
x
child’s
house.
so
the
police
went
there
and
knocked
on
the
door
and
asked
for
the
child
in
question
and
when
the
little
girl
of
the
house,
there
were
no
adults
in
the
house,
said,
the
little
girl
in
--
runaway
girl
was
not
there,
the
police
went
in
and
picked
her
up.
the
argument
was
made
that
they
should
have
gone
to
the
police
station
and
spent
two
days
swearing
out
a
warrant
and
this
is
just
one
of
the
many
examples.
what
i
mean
the
difference
between
a
state
police
which
has
a
problem
of
keeping
the
peace
and
federal
agents
which
have
an
entirely
different
role,
highly
specialized
role
where
they
probably
have
time
to
go
and
swear
out
a
warrant
because
the
man
they
are
pursuing
is
maybe
a
bank
robber
who
is
crossing
the
state
line
or
something
like
that.
but
–
so,
in
this
re-argument
before
this
court,
there
again,
i
think
that
history
shows
that
an
arrest
within
a
house
without
a
warrant
way
--
date
way
back
to
the
17th
century
in
england
in
semane's
(ph)
case,
on
probable
cause.
on
probable
cause
the
police
have
always
been
able
to
start
going
into
a
home
and
make
an
arrest.
ms.
louise
korns
yes,
your
honor,
i
am.
ms.
louise
korns
well
--
ms.
louise
korns
well,
i
gathered
from
reading
of
this
court’s
opinion
in
coolidge
versus
new
hampshire,
the
samurai,
that
the
majority
opinion
without
passing
on
the
question,
pointed
out
that
they
--
that
--i
think
mr.
justice
stewart
wrote
the
opinion,
point
out,
you
thought
that
to
allow
a
warrantless
entry
into
a
home
would
conflict
with
the
fourth
amendment,
but
my
answer
to
that
is
--
ms.
louise
korns
i
am
familiar
with
that.
ms.
louise
korns
right.
this
court
of
course
never
squarely
said.
it
did
call
that
the
exigent
circumstances,
that
is
right.
ms.
louise
korns
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
your
honor,
though
that
now
if
you
are
going
to
take
the
position
that
the
fourth
amendment
requires
a
warrant
to
seize
a
person
in
the
home,
i
see
no
difference
between
that
in
seizing
a
person
in
the
street.0
because
the
injury
to
the
person,
when
you
go
into
a
house
for
instance,
a
seizure
of
a
person
is
completely
different
from
rifling
through
drawers
and
desk
drawers
and
so
forth
for
things.
you
go
to
the
door
like
here
in
this
case
and
it
was
not
at
night,
it
was
at
daybreak.
it
was
at
6:15
to
6:30
in
the
morning.
now,
i
get
up
at
six
and
lots
of
people
get
up
at
six.
this
was
not
in
the
middle
of
the
night.
police
went
to
the
door,
knocked
on
the
door,
ms.
johnson
came,
they
announced
they
were
the
new
orleans
police
and
their
authority
and
their
purpose.
they
had
come
to
arrest
frank
johnson.
he
could
have
come
forward
to
the
door
as
he
was
legally
bound
to
do
and
surrendered
himself.
the
police
never
would
have
had
to
put
a
toe
in
the
door,
but
he
hid
under
the
bed.
now,
all
you
have
to
do
when
you
go
into
a
house
to
look
for
a
person
that
you
reasonably
believe
is
there,
you
know
how
to
go
through
all
the
desk
drawers
and
everything,
you
look
under
the
bed
he
is
hiding
or
a
closet,
just
open
the
door,
they
cannot
be
very
far
back
and
where
else
can
they
get?
that
is
not
like
tearing
everything
up
to
pieces
and
so
forth.
not
only
that,
as
i
say,
i
think
the
deprivation
of
liberty
is
not
the
picking
up
of
the
person
from
their
home,
if
you
are
going
to
look
at
it,
if
you
are
going
to
need
a
warrant,
then
why
do
you
not
need
a
warrant
to
pick
up
a
person
on
the
street?
you
are
going
to
take
him
to
jail
and
hold
him
until
their
lawyer
can
come
see
about
it
and
--
ms.
louise
korns
sir?
ms.
louise
korns
that
is
what
i
say.
as
i
see
it,
why
should
you
split
them
up?
you
either
have
to
say
that
you
have
to
have
a
warrant
for
every
arrest
or
you
do
not
have
to
have
a
warrant
for
arrest,
but
not
to
split
it
up
in
the
house
and
outside
the
house
as
i
see
it.
now,
it
is
apparent
from
mr.
buckley’s
argument
that
he
has
not
been
orleans
parish
in
the
past
few
years
because
right
now,
ever
since
we
argued
this
case
last
month,
i
had
been
taking
an
interest
in
jury
trials,
the
racial
composition
of
jury
trials
and
trying
to
figure
out
how
they
split
and
there
is
absolutely
no
pattern
to
them.
in
the
first
place,
there
are
at
least
five
points,
average
5.4
negroes
on
every
twelve-man
jury
in
orleans
parish
now
because
they
run
up
to
eight
in
some
juries
and
they
are
down
to
three
or
four
in
others,
but
they
--
that
five
or
six
average,
five
and
a
half
negroes
in
every
jury
so
they
can
well
take
care
of
themselves
if
they
need
three
votes
if
they
think
it.
there
is
case
after
case
where
the
victim
is
black,
the
accused
is
black,
they
have
six
black
jurors
and
six
whites
and
they
vote
ten
to
two,
six
blacks,
guilty
of
charged,
4
whites
guilty
as
charged,
two
whites,
not
guilty.
i
mean,
this
is
just
random
because
another
time
you
will
find
another
way,
but
there
is
absolutely
no,
nothing
to
show
that
the
blacks
have
to
protect
themselves
that
they
need
a
unanimous
verdict
to
protect
themselves
because
they
are
well
able
to
protect
themselves
right
now
and
generally
they
do
not
vote
in
a
racist
way.
ms.
louise
korns
nothing.
absolutely.
and
nothing,
absolutely
and
from
--
an
indications
of
what
is
have
studied
in
other
cases,
i
would
very
much
doubt
that
three
vote
--
jurors
voting
not
--
who
had
not
joined
the
guilty
vote,
it
does
not
mean
that
they
felt
they
were
not
guilty
as
--
and
our
brief
points
out,
if
they
have
sit
there
--
sat
there
long
enough,
there
is
a
95%
chance
they
would
have
reached
unanimity.
but
experience
shows
that
they
were
probably
a
mixture
of
black
and
white,
those
three.
they
might
have
been
all
white
even
or
they
might
of
course
been
black,
but
there
is
no
definite
pattern.
not
only
that,
i
think
your
honors
must
have
read
in
time
magazine
about
how
in
the
black
panther
trial
in
orleans
parish
last
july,
there
were
10
blacks,
2
whites,
unanimous,
not
guilty.
hewitt
nelson,
hewitt
nelson
got
a
hung
jury
in
oakland
and
when
the
jury
came
in
he
said,
oh!
this
proves
that
having
one
negro
on
a
jury
and
choosing
a
fair
trial,
but
who
was
the
--
who
hung
the
juror,
jury,
a
white
woman,
a
white
woman
hung
the
jury,
not
the
sole
black
woman
on
the
jury.
ms.
louise
korns
yes
your
honor.
it
was
just
because
mr.
buckley
was
arguing
this
point
that
i
brought
this
out.
ms.
louise
korns
well
i
agree
with
you,
i
agree
with
you.
it
was
just
an
answer
to
appellant’s
argument
that
i
wanted
to
point
out
that
i
do
think
is
that
--
ms.
louise
korns
no
sir.
ms.
louise
korns
no
well
i
--
i
frankly
admit.
i
know
from
experience
the
police
never
swear
out
an
arrest
warrant
in
orleans
parish
unless
the
person
is
a
fugitive
and
they
cannot
immediately
arrest
him
and
so
they
swear
out
the
warrant
to
send
to
another
parish
or
to
send
to
another
state.
but
never
in
a
case
like
this
do
the
police,
they
always
rely
on
louisiana
code
of
criminal
procedure,
article
213
and
they
just
never
come
to
searing
out
a
warrant
because
they
have
this
statutory
authority
to
arrest
without
a
warrant.
so,
is
there
any
question
the
court
would
like
to
ask
to
me
further?
then,
alright.
thank
you,
your
honor.
ms.
louise
korns
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
louise
korns
the
rule
at
common
law
was
--
as
i
see
it
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
under
semane's
case
in
england
that
there
was
no
need
for
a
warrant
at
all
to
enter
a
house.
at
common
law
there
never
has
been
a
need
if
--
there
has
to
be
probable
cause
of
course.
but
in
semane's
case
they
state
very
clearly
that
there
is
no
need
to
--
that
an
arrest
can
be
made
in
a
home
with
or
without
a
warrant
based
on
probable
cause.
and
all
the
english
commentators
point
out
that
the
rule
that
are
--
a
man’s
home
is
his
castle,
there
is
an
exception
to
this
rule
exist
in
the
case
of
arrest
that
no
man
can
--
no
man
has
as
a
castle
against
the
king.
so
actually
--
ms.
louise
korns
i
do
not
believe
so
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
believe
fourth
amendment
was
adopted
to
overrule
the
writs
of
assistance
and
the
general
warrants
--
ms.
louise
korns
--
which
were
completely
different
from
this.
now,
general
warrants
in
writs
of
assistance
were
issued
by
the
king,
the
writs
of
assistant
--
a
writ
of
assistance
was
given
by
the
king
to
one
of
his
favorites
to
run
for
the
life
of
the
king,
it
was
a
document
just
enabling
him
to
arrest
whomever
at
his
will
he
wanted
to.
there
had
--
did
not
have
to
be
any
probable
cause,
did
not
have
to
be
anything.
so,
how
can
you
possibly
liken
the
louisiana’s
code
of
--
louisiana
statute
permitting
a
writ
based
on
reasonable
cause
to
a
writ
of
assistance
which
was
a
blanket
writ
in
which
no
cause
at
all
had
to
exist.
ms.
louise
korns
no.
but
that
is
what
i
said,
it
could
not
be
that.
but
so
--
but
that
is
why
you
ask
me
if
i
--
if
possibly
the
fourth
amendment
was
drawn
up
to
prevent
the
rule,
the
common
law
rule
then
existing
from
being
in
existence
in
england
and
i
think
--
my
answer
is
that
is
absolutely
no.
i
think
it
was
directed
at
the
writs
of
assistant
--
writs
of
assistance
which
were
in
derogation
of
the
common
law
and
that
the
fourth
amendment
was
meant
to
ensure
that
the
common
law
existed
in
this
country
and
that
general
warrants
in
derogation
of
the
common
law
and
arrest
and
imprisonments
without
a
cause
could
not
exist.
ms.
louise
korns
well,
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
code
of
article
says
that
they
can
only
go
to
a
house
where
they
have
reasonable
cause
to
believe
the
person
to
be.
so
--
ms.
louise
korns
i
do
not
think
they
could
go
into
a
house
then.
they
have
to
get
a
reason
--
ms.
louise
korns
well,
they
would
have
to
test
it
the
same
way
they
test
any
unreasonable
searches
for
a
motion
to
suppress.
ms.
louise
korns
no,
well,
in
other
words
you
mean
if
the
man
was
illegally
arrested
and
no
evidence
was
seized,
that
i
do
not
know
how
you
would
test
it.
how
do
you
test
any,
or
how
do
you
test
anything?
ms.
louise
korns
well,
of
course,
we
take
--
we
took
the
position
that
--
the
accused
did
not
raise
this
point
in
the
district
court,
he
raises
for
the
first
time
on
appeal
so
–
ms.
louise
korns
yes,
well,
he
raised
--
he
--
in
the
supreme
court
he
argued
that
he
wanted
to
suppress
his
pretrial
identification.
ms.
louise
korns
by
a
motion
to
suppress.
however,
we
take
the
position
that
no
court
has
ever
held
that
a
pretrial
identification
is
something
subject
to
a
motion
to
suppress.
ms.
louise
korns
unless
he
filed
a
motion
--
unless
he
--
some
property
has
been
seized.
i
will
argue
that
--
ms.
louise
korns
he
could
file
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
i
imagine.
but
generally,
you
see,
the
reason
i
am
puzzled
by
this
--
ms.
louise
korns
well,
he
could
at
--
now
that
i
am
thinking
of
--
he
can
ask
for
a
preliminary
hearing
immediately
.he
can
ask
to
be
brought
before
a
magistrate
and
have
a
preliminary
hearing
immediately
in
which
the
state
has
to
show
probable
cause
to
hold
him.
that
is
--
i
am
sorry,
that
is
what
he
can
do
certainly.
so
if
the
court
would
not
care
about
further
questions
and
thank
you,
your
honors.
