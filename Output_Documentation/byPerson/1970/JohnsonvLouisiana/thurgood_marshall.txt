justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
want
unanimity
with
12
in
all
crimes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
they
say
a
9
out
of
12
for
murder,
then
you'd
be
out
of
courtrooms?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but,
you
have
equal
protection
of
course?
justice
thurgood
marshall
of
course,
you
recognize
that
some
defense
counsel
would
rather
have
25
of
the
unanimous
requirement?
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
they
deliberated
for
four
days
and
came
in
9-3?
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
they
come
in
11-1?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
my
whole
point
is,
i
just
want
to
know
how
much
stress
you're
putting
on
this
length
of
time
of
deliberation,
that's
all
i'm
trying
to
clear
in
my
mind.
you
seem
to
say
that
the
only
purpose
that
you
want
to
(inaudible)
jury
is
so
that
they'll
deliberate
and
obviously
from
you
answer,
that's
not
what
you
mean
to
say.
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
the
most
of
the
11-1
juries
are
short-term?
i
don't
know
what
part
of
the
country
you're
talking
about.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
i
mean.
there
are
quite
a
few.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
days
and
days
and
days.
that's
the
trouble
with
the
weight
you're
putting
on
these
two
different
points.
i
think
you
realize
that
you
just
can't
take
12
out
the
clear
blue
sky
and
bag
it
up.
that's
the
feeling
i
get
from
your
argument,
am
i
right?
i
don't
understand,
your
honor,
but
-
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
12?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
would
be
satisfied
with
the
five-man
unanimous
verdict
of
murder,
including
the
death
penalty.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
your
limit?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
here
you
have
9
men?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
you're
back
where
if
you're
just
on
the
unanimous?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mrs.
korns,
is
it
possible
to
be
convicted
of
murder
and
get
35
years
in
louisiana
as
sentence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
your
point
is,
as
i
understand
the
petitioner's
argument,
he
says
that
if
he's
going
to
end
up
with
a
punishment
in
prison,
the
same
prison
that
somebody
else
goes
to
for
practically
the
same
amount
of
time,
that
he
has
less
chance
of
a
hung
jury
with
the
majority
ones
than
he
has
with
the
unanimous
ones?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
is
it
that
you
have
unanimous
protection?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
arrest
warrants
do
you
have?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
proud
of
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
say
this
was
a
reasonable
search?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
was
just
wondering
if
six
men
with
shotguns
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
with
their
shotguns.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
who
else
is
in
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
they
know
who
else
is
in
there?
how
many
children
were
in
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
women
are
in
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
sure
they
knocked?
justice
thurgood
marshall
with
their
guns
up?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
mr.
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
was
mr.
johnson?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
searched
his
house
and
found
the
man
was
hiding
under
the
bed.
justice
thurgood
marshall
let
us
get
back
to
this
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i
fail
to
see
where
it
is
in
place
in
the
case
though?
justice
thurgood
marshall
may
i
go
back
to
one
other
point?
has
a
warrant
ever
been
issued
to
johnson?
justice
thurgood
marshall
not
until
this
day?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
in
louisiana
law
that
would
prevent
police
from
putting
out
a
house
to
house
search
into
the
whole
neighborhood
on
the
suspicion
that
somebody
in
that
neighborhood
committed
a
crime?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
have
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
the
guy
is
in
the
square
plaza?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
how
would
they
test
it
under
louisiana
law
as
to
how
much
information
this
officer
had?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
could
not
motion
to
suppress
the
body?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
would
you
test
the
right
of
the
policeman
coming
to
his
home
at
dawn?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
could
he
have
raised
it
in
the
district
court,
i
asked
the
question
how?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
how
could
he
have
raised?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
point
is
how
can
you
test
validity
of
the
policeman’s
information
that
he
had
probable
cause
to
go
into
his
home
and
arrest
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
there
is
no
way
to
protect
this
--
there
is
no
way
under
louisiana
law
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
imagine,
but
you
see
this
--
it
seems
to
me
this
is
a
fundamental
right
to
come
and
pick
me
up,
not
only
in
the
middle
of
the
night
or
dawn
but
anytime
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
want
unanimity
with
12
in
all
crimes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
they
