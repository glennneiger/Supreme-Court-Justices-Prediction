chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
51-61,
johnson
against
louisiana.
mr.
buckley,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
get
that
last,
four
days
all
together?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
now
when
you
responded
to
justice
blackmun,
were
you
responding
as
to
your
own
choice
as
a
matter
of
policy
or
a
constitutional
requirement?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
the
standard,
the
constitutional
standard,
mr.
buckley,
which
is
likely,
more
likely
or
less
likely,
to
produce
a
verdict
of
guilty
or
not
guilty?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
have
the
same
objection
if
the
9-3
verdict
were
permitted
in
louisiana
after
three
hours
of
deliberation
or
two
or
four
hours?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
hypothetical
situation
that
i
put
to
you
that
it
applies
in
some
states,
doesn't
restrict
it.
it
restricts
the
jury
merely
in
returning
a
less
than
unanimous
verdict
until
they
have
run
the
course
of
some
minimum
period
of
deliberation.
in
many
states,
as
you
know,
in
civil
cases
particularly,
after
x-hours
of
deliberation,
they
may
return
a
verdict
of
5-6
in
a
civil
case.
now,
do
you
think
that's
as
constitutionally
objectionable
in
criminal
cases
as
the
one
we're
dealing
with
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
thought
you
were
complaining
at
the
brevity
of
their
deliberations
under
the
9-3
provision
of
cal
--
of
louisiana,
permitted
a
verdict
to
come
back
in
a
short
time
and
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
particular
provision
of
the
constitution
would
you
rest
on
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
what
you're
saying
is
that
because
three
have
a
doubt,
nine
must
have
a
doubt
or
should
have
had
a
doubt?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
see
any
parallel
at
all
between
a
requirement
of
unanimity
that
you
argue
for
in
a
jury
case
and
a
requirement
that
has
sometimes
been
proposed
of
unanimity
of
multiple-judge
appellate
court?
is
there
any
connection
between
the
two?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
when
an
appellate
court,
this
court
included,
reviews
a
claim
of
sufficiency
of
evidence,
is
there
some
connection
between
that
and
the
jury
function?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
because
they
enlarge
on
that
a
little
bit?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
was
addressing
myself
to
the
situation
when
the
jury
has
found
a
guilty
verdict
and
it
is
being
reviewed
for
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
you
consider
that
purely
a
question
of
law
than
when
an
appellate
court
reviews
on
that
basis?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
essence
of
your
argument
is
that
whenever
time
permits,
there
must
be
a
warrant
to
make
an
arrest,
that's
what
it
adds
up
to,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
in
a
home
you
would
require
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mrs.
korns.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
we'll
see
what
your
needs
are.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
since
mr.
buckley
has
run
out
of
time,
if
we
do
enlarge
yours,
we'll
enlarge
his
a
little
bit.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mrs.
korns.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
pursue
mr.
justice
stewart's
question,
if
a
state
provided
that
all
automobiles
of
up
to
2,000
pounds
would
have
a
license
of
$10
and
all
those
over
2,000
would
be
$20,
would
there
be
any
equal
protection
problem
in
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
if
it's
based
upon
the
weight
of
the
automobile
or
the
price
of
the
automobile,
is
that
an
invidious
discrimination?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
of
course,
since
you
mentioned
it,
you
recall
that
there
were,
i
think,
5
colonies
out
of
the
13
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
which
had
less
than
unanimous.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
there
was
no
federal
law
on
the
subject
then
at
all,
was
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
federal
government?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn't
there
another
stage
in
there?
isn't
there
another
stage
and
that
is
that
the
nine
may
persuade
the
three
so
that
it
isn't
--
there's
no
assurance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
the
argument
is
made
--
had
been
made
by
mr.
buckley
that
a
9-3
verdict
means
there
are
9
jurors
partial
to
the
prosecution.
i
suppose
your
answer
to
that
might
be
that
if
it's
a
unanimous
verdict
of
12
then
there
are
12
who
are
partial
to
the
prosecution.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mrs.
korns.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you've
only
got
about
3-4
minutes
left
for
the
arrest
point
if
you
want
to
reach
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
make
the
election
as
to
which
you
want
to
argue.
i
just
wanted
to
alert
you.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
you've
covered
this.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
i
think
we
know
the
facts,
mrs.
korns.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
number
5035,
frank
johnson
against
louisiana.
mr.
buckley
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
evidence
seized
or
found
at
the
home
at
the
time
of
the
arrest
was
admitted
in
evidence
against
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
tangible
evidence
other
than
his
own
body,
any
others?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
they
did
not
seize
any
guns
or
(voice

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
you
are
saying
is
that
a
man,
a
person
can
never
be
arrested
at
his
home
without
a
warrant,
that
is
what
it
adds
up
to,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
buckley.
mrs.
korns.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
any
event
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
in
this
case
(voice

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mrs.
korns.
mr.
buckley
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.

thank
you
mr.

thank

well,
the
