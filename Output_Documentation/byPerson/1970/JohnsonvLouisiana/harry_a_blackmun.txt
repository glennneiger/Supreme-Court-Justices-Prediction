how
old
is
the
louisiana

is
it
an
ancient
one?

mr.

--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
as
a
lawyer
engaged
in
the
defense
of
criminal
cases,
do
you
think
it's
harder
to
get
unanimity
among
5
or
9
out
of
12?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
5
out
of
5
is
obviously
more
difficult
than
4
out
of
5,
but
i
wondered
if
5
out
of
5
was
harder
to
obtain
than
9
out
of
12.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
i
understand
that
you
would
not
object
to
a
two-man
jury
or
a
one-man
jury?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
where
would
you
draw
the
line?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
buckley,
in
any
event,
you
are
not
attacking
the
five-man
in
this
case?
justice
harry

blackmun
mrs.
korns,
as
far
as
you
know,
has
the
louisiana
system
ever
been
federally
attacked
before
this
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but,
on
the
unanimity
provision
or
lack
of
it,
you've
had
no
federal
attack
for
75
years?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mrs.
korns,
let
me
ask
you
a
question.
did
--
you're
not
old
enough
and
this
isn't
a
legal
question,
but
wasn't
there
a
fairly
popular
movie
a
long
time
ago,
i
think
it
was
henry
fonda
in
the
lead
role,
which
had
to
do
with
a
jury
process?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
one
man
initially
holding
up

it
does
happen
in
fiction,
doesn't
it?
