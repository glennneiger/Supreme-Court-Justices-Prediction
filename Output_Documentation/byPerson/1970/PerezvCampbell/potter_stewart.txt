justice
potter
stewart
the
judgment
was
--
the
judgment
ran
against
both
the
man
and
the
wife,
did
it
or
did
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
theory
on
which
the
lawsuit
was
brought
against
her
i.e.
the
wife
was
what,
because
the
husband
was
driving
the
car
alone
in
the
car,
was
he
not,
at
the
time
of
the
collision?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
complaint
joined
her
as
a
defendant
on
what
theory,
on
the
community
property
theory
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
confession
of
judgment
was
filed
on
behalf
of
both
defendants,
man
and
wife?
justice
potter
stewart
the
complaint,
the
original
complaint
was
based,
i
suppose
upon
the
husband’s
negligent
conduct
in
driving
the
automobile,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
was
it
based
at
all
on
the
--
against
the
wife
under
--
on
the
basis
that
she
had
been
negligent
in
lending
the
car
for
him
to
drive?
justice
potter
stewart
or
anything
such
as
that?
it
was
not
based
at
all
on
her
independent
negligence,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
(inaudible)
on
the
complaint
that
is
the
wrong,
the
wrongful
injuries
were
wrongful
injuries
because
of
the
husband’s
negligence,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
nothing
as
to
--
nothing
in
the
complaint
about
the
wife’s
negligence,
no
allegations
as
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
she
was
joined
merely
as
a
member
of
the
community
that
owned
the
automobile,
i
suppose?
justice
potter
stewart
well
now,
where
was
title
to
the
automobile?
justice
potter
stewart
but
as
a
matter
of
arizona
law,
if
the
automobile
was
acquired
after
their
marriage,
regardless
to
the
title
it
nonetheless
belonged
half
to
his
wife,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
that
--
that
takes
care
of
emma
perez,
but
in
order
for
you
to
prevail
with
respect
to
adolfo,
it
would
be
necessary
for
you
to
persuade
this
court
to
overrule
kesler,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
decision
cited
in
your
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
have
the
citation?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
you
mentioned
the
second
circuit
decision
in
conflict.
have
you
got
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
about
a
week
ago
in
law
week?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
i’m
a
little
dense,
but
i
don’t
quite
see
the
connection
between
the
statute
and
keeping
people
off
their
welfare
rolls,
just
as
a
matter
of
relevant
connection.
this
--
if
a
person
in
arizona
is
in
an
accident
and
there’s
a
judgment
him
that
remains
unpaid,
he
has
to
give
up
his
license,
he
can’t
drive.
that’s
what
the
statute
says,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
now
what’s
that
got
to
do
with
the
welfare
roll?
i
think
his
discharging
bankruptcy
would
more
likely
keep
him
off
the
welfare
rolls.
justice
potter
stewart
i
--
would
you
explain
to
me
what
it
really
has
to
do
with
the
welfare,
presence
on
the
welfare
rolls
or
not
of
anybody?
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
the
uncompensated
victim,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
by
hypothesis,
the
victim
is
already
been
victimized.
he’s
been
hit
by
an
negligent
driver
and
injured,
let’s
say,
or
suffered
property
loss.
now
then
what’s
--
so
he’s
already
been
victimized?
justice
potter
stewart
by
a
man
who
can’t
pay
a
judgment,
by
hypothesis,
and
so
what
--
does
it
matter
what
you
do
to
that
man
who
can’t
pay
the
judgment
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
somebody
goes
on
the
welfare
rolls?
justice
potter
stewart
my
hypothesis,
a
judgment
proof
debtor
has
hit
this
person,
so
therefore
his
injuries
can
not
be
compensated.
now,
whether
or
not
the
victim
goes
on
a
welfare
rolls
hardly
has
anything
to
do
with
what
you
do
to
that
judgment
proof
debtor,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
by
hypothesis,
this
is
it,
isn’t
it
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
it
--
we’re
talking
here
about
a
judgment
creditor
who
can’t
pay
--
a
judgment
debtor
who
can
not
pay
the
judgment,
aren’t
we?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that’s
a
fact
in
this
case
as
it
comes
to
us?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
very
well,
i
didn’t
mean
to
throw
you
off.
but
i
just
don’t
myself
see
the
connection
between
this
to
any
possible,
a
very
rational
or
relevant
connection
between
this
statute
and
the
question
of
who
goes
on
the
welfare
rolls
and
who
doesn’t?
justice
potter
stewart
now
mr.
ching
told
us
that
it
was
the
practice
in
arizona
in
a
situation
such
as
alleged
here,
i.e.
personal
injuries
caused
by
the
sole
negligence
of
a
husband
driving
a
car
registered
in
his
name,
but
which
is
community
property.
he
told
us
that
it
is
the
practice
in
arizona
to
get
a
judgment
against
husband
and
wife
because
assume
the
wife
is
a
wage
earner,
half
of
her
wage
is
i
guess
belong
the
husband
and
could
be
levied
against
by
the
judgment
creditor,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
it
is
the
prevailing
practice?
justice
potter
stewart
so
what
you’re
saying
is
that
if
the
allegations
here
are
correct,
the
judgment
against
here
was
completely
unjustified
under
arizona
law?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
only
because
of
the
existence
of
the
bankruptcy
act
and
because
of
the
supremacy
clause
which
wouldn’t
touch
the
requirement
of
insurance.
justice
potter
stewart
their
argument
is
based
upon
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
bankruptcy
power
of
congress
and
it's
--
and
the
legislation
that
congress
has
enacted
under
that
power
being
supreme
to
the
laws
of
arizona.
it’s
not
based
on,
at
the
moment
at
least,
on
any
concepts
of
due
process
or
equal
protection,
that’s
the
reason
for
that
difference,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
bankruptcy
legislation
wouldn’t
have
anything
to
do
with
your
compulsory
insurance
statute,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
well
as
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
you
earlier,
where
does
all
has
leave
us
with
respect
to
the
issue
in
this
case,
with
respect
to
emma
perez?
the
fact
is
that
she
is
now
a
judgment
creditor
rightly
or
wrongly,
erroneously
or
correctly
under
arizona
law,
she
is
one
and
--
a
judgment
debtor,
i
beg
your
pardon,
judgment
debtor
i
misspoke.
and
that
now
her
claim
is
that
because
of
her
discharge
and
because
of
the
effect
of
the
bankruptcy
proceedings,
her
liability
to
the
judgment
creditor
is
now
discharged
as
a
matter
of
the
supremacy
of
federal
law.
now
wouldn’t
that
argument
be
just
as
good
or
bad
just
as
sound
or
unsound,
whether
or
not
the
original
judgment
against
her
was
justified
or
unjustified?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
what
i
gather
is
what
mr.
ching
is
talking
about?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
the
judgment
was
--
the
judgment
ran
against
both
the
man
and
the

did
it
or
did
not?

justice
potter
stewart
and
the
complaint
joined
her
as
a
defendant
on
what
theory,
on
the
community
property
theory
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
confession
of
judgment
was
filed
on
behalf
of
both
defendants,
man
and
wife?
justice
potter
stewart
the
complaint,
the
original
complaint
was
based,
i
suppose
upon
the
husband’s
negligent
conduct
in
driving
the
automobile,
is
that
correct?
justice

stewart
was
it

at

on

that
she

he’s

by
