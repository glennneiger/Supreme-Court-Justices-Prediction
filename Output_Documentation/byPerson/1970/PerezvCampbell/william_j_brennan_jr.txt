brennan,

well
mr.
schlosser,
as
i
read
that
opinion
it
isn’t
that
is
no
more
valid.
am
i
right
that
in
effect
what
your
court
said
was
that
the
principle,
the
primary,
i
think
the
word
primary
was
--

j.
brennan,
jr.
--
was
financial
in
order
to
keep,
as
you
said,
victims
off
the
welfare
rolls
and
the
others
were
on
the
incidental.
now,
are
you
suggesting
the
significant
--
that
has
no
significance
for
us
in
the
constitutional
question?
justice
william
j.

i’m
also
suggest

justice
william
j.
brennan,

well,
what
we’re
talking
as
i
understand
it,
we’re
talking
about
a
statute
either
identically
or
similarly
phrased
as
to
which,
however,
your
supreme
court
has
given
a
gloss,
not
given
in
the
statute
involved
in
the
kesler
case,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
think
that
nevertheless
has
no
significance
for
us
on
the
constitutional
question?
