mr.
anthony
b.
ching
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
review
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
facts
are
relatively
simple.
the
petitioners
here
are
adolfo
perez
and
his
wife
emma
perez.
they
live
in
tucson,
arizona.
on
july
8,
1965,
adolfo
perez,
while
driving
his
family
car,
had
an
accident.
a
year
or
so
later,
a
lawsuit
was
filed
against
adolfo
perez
and
his
wife
based
on
the
accident.
a
year
or
so
later,
the
perez’s
confessed
judgment
and
the
judgment
was
rendered
against
the
two
of
them
as
husband
and
wife.
thereafter,
adolfo
and
emma
perez
each
filed
a
petition
in
bankruptcy.
the
judgment
was
scheduled
in
each
of
the
bankruptcy
petition,
and
in
due
course
that
that
was
discharged.
however,
arizona
law
provides
that
anyone
who
has
a
judgment
of
this
kind
against
him
would
have
his
driver’s
license
and
automobile
registration
suspended
until
the
judgment
or
a
part
of
it
is
paid.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
yes.
that
judgment
is
in
the
record.
it’s
not
reproduced
in
the
appendix.
however,
it’s
in
the
record
on
page
54
and
55.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
the
confession
judgment
was
entered
by
their
attorney.
they
had
--
this
is
not
in
the
record,
but
i
will
supply
that
information
to
the
court
if
the
court
desires
the
information.
the
perez’s
retained
counsel.
an
answer
was
filed
denying
the
negligence.
on
the
date
of
trial,
counsel
advised
the
perez’s
to
confess
judgment
so
that
he
can
take
them
to
bankruptcy.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
yes,
the
husband
was
alone.
this
was
alleged
in
the
complaint.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
exactly.
in
arizona,
it
is
a
common
practice
in
suing
a
marital
community
to
sue
both
the
husband
and
wife.
the
complaint
is
also
in
the
record,
i
believe
its
page
53
and
54
preceding
the
judgment
in
the
record.
again,
it’s
not
reproduced
in
the
appendix.
the
complaint
named
him
and
django
perez,
his
wife
and
subsequently
the
judgment
recited
emma
perez
since
here
true
name
was
late
unknown.
but
the
complaint
spelled
out
that
the
suit
was
against
adolfo
perez
and
the
marital
community
husband
and
wife.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
that’s
right.
and
so
it’s
a
judgment,
reciting
judgment
against
adolfo
and
emma
perez,
husband
and
wife.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
in
arizona,
the
--
a
suit
can
be
brought
either
against
the
husband
or
against
husband
and
wife.
this
is
entirely
at
the
option
of
the
plaintiff’s
attorney.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
this
is
not
shown
by
any
of
the
case
law
in
arizona
regarding
community
property.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
most
plaintiffs
are
not
willing
to
do
that
because
most
plaintiffs
feel
that
wife
may
have
a
job
and
it
will
be
easier
to
garnish
or
execute
on
the
wife
if
the
complaint
and
the
judgment
reads
the
wife’s
name.
in
other
words,
the
wife’s
earnings
are
the
community
property
during
marriage
and
a
complaint
and
a
judgment
against
husband
and
wife
will
facilitate
the
garnishment
and
execution
of
a
judgment.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
exactly.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
no.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
no,
there’s
no
allegation
in
the
complaint
as
to
that
at
all.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
exactly.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
no.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
that
is
correct.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
the
title
to
the
automobile
is
in
the
name
of
adolfo
perez
only.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
exactly.
the
automobile
is
community
property.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
and
the
wife
has
an
interest
in
it,
although
the
husband
is
the
manager.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
yes,
arizona
permits
the
holding
of
a
personal
property
in
joint
tenancy.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
the
case
will
not
be
any
different
other
than
not
only
the
community
property
of
the
husband
and
wife,
but
also
emma
perez’s
separate
property
will
then
become
liable.
so
in
other
words,
the
joint
property
will
make
it
a
joint
in
several
obligations.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
certainly,
your
honor
and
this
has
been
done
in
three
states:
new
york,
massachusetts
and
north
carolina.
after
surrendering
to
the
state
their
licenses
upon
demand,
the
petitioner’s
filed
a
lawsuit
in
the
district
court.
the
state
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
a
single-judge
granted
their
motion
to
dismiss.
the
case
then
was
appealed
to
the
ninth
circuit,
and
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
the
decision
and
thereafter,
certiorari
was
petitioned
for
--
by
the
petitioners
and
this
court
granted
certiorari.
this
case
involves
a
very
important
and
alleged
conflict
between
a
state
statute
and
the
federal
bankruptcy
act.
this
issue
has
been
before
the
court
twice
within
the
last
20
years,
in
the
case
of
reitz
versus
mealey,
a
new
york
case,
and
kesler
versus
department
of
public
safety,
a
case
coming
from
utah.
the
statue
was
upheld
under
similar
circumstances
as
regarding
adolfo
perez
by
a
divided
court
in
both
cases.
our
argument
here
will
be
that
this
court
should
reexamine
these
earlier
cases
and
after
due
consideration,
overrule
these
cases,
because
they
are
not
logically
sound
and
that
they
are
now
out
of
date
and
also
that
in
applying
arizona
law,
the
rationale
used
by
the
court
previously
is
not
applicable.
in
the
reitz
case
and
in
kesler,
this
court
sustained
a
statute
on
a
basis
that
the
purposes
of
these
statutes
are
to
deter
irresponsible
driving
and
to
promote
public
safety
which
of
course
is
a
valid
exercise
of
the
state’s
police
power.
we
would
urge
the
court
to
consider
our
argument
that
the
statute
really
does
not
deter
irresponsible
driving
and
does
not
protect
the
public
safety.
this
type
of
suspension
is
not
suspension
for
the
conduct
of
negligent
driving,
but
a
suspension
for
the
nonpayment
of
the
judgment.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
the
arizona
statute
has
for
the
purpose
the
financially
irresponsible
drivers
that
it’s
trying
to
reach
and
not
the
drivers
who
are
irresponsible
in
their
conduct.
and
i
will
illustrate
by
pointing
out
to
this
court
that
arizona
as
in
every
state
have
criminal
sanctions
against
irresponsible
driving,
for
drunk
driving,
for
manslaughter,
for
various
violations.
and
yet
under
arizona
law,
no
suspension
can
be
for
more
than
one
year.
even
if
a
person’s
license
is
revoked
for
vehicular
manslaughter
or
for
twice
driving
under
the
influence
of
alcohol
or
drugs,
he
can
apply
to
regain
his
license
after
one
year.
but
in
this
case,
a
person
whose
license
is
suspended
can
not
get
his
license
and
sometimes
permanently
until
he
pays
the
judgment.
this
i
believe
demonstrates
that
public
safety
is
not
what
is
intended
by
the
statute.
the
statue
is
intended
to
collect
the
dept
to
aid
a
victim.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
exactly.
what
i’m
saying
is
that
for
a
person
who
has
insurance
who
is
convicted
for
manslaughter
or
drunk
driving,
his
insurance
company
would
pay
the
judgment
and
he
can
regain
his
license
after
one
year.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
no.
i
said
a
state
can
require
everybody
to
have
insurance.
i’m
only
trying
to
point
out
to
this
court
that
there
is
a
obvious
conflict
with
the
bankruptcy
act.
had
neither
of
these
petitioners
gone
through
bankruptcy,
then
i
would
say
there
are
constitutional
questions,
maybe
surrounding,
especially
emma
perez’s
claim.
but
now
that
both
these
petitioners
have
gone
through
bankruptcy,
they
have
the
shield
of
bankruptcy,
and
therefore,
the
only
conflict
that
needs
to
be
resolved
by
this
court
is
whether
or
not
the
statute
conflicts
with
the
bankruptcy
act.
i’m
not
asking
this
court
to
reach
any
constitutional
decisions
in
this
case.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
as
far
as
mrs.
perez’s
concerned,
i
believe
that
this
court
can
very
well
distinguish
the
kesler
case
on
a
basis
that
the
kesler
case
as
stated
in
the
opinion
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
state
statute
has
for
the
purpose
the
deterring
of
irresponsible
driving
and
that
that
purpose
is
absent
as
far
as
mrs.
perez
is
concerned.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
--
because
she
is
not
a
negligent
driver.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
i’m
not
asking
this
court
to
set
aside
a
state
judgment,
the
state
judgment
is
perfectly
valid.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
because
mrs.
perez
having
gone
through
bankruptcy,
the
judgment
is
duly
discharged
in
bankruptcy.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
yes,
i
believe
that
this
court
can,
because
the
rationale
of
kesler
does
not
cover
persons
such
as
mrs.
perez
who
is
not
--
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
no
that
would
only
require
the
same
approach
under
the
bankruptcy
act
and
the
supremacy
clause.
as
to
mrs.
perez,
there
is
a
clear
conflict
between
the
state
statute
requiring
that
every
person
against
whom
a
judgment
is
rendered
to
surrender
the
license
and
the
federal
bankruptcy
act.
a
clear
conflict
has
emerged
and
absent
the
rationale
in
kesler
as
pertaining
to
the
negligent
driver,
mrs.
perez
must
have
the
cloak
of
protection
of
the
federal
bankruptcy
act.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
exactly.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
no.
it
is
not
necessary
to
reach
this
argument
because
as
i’ve
said
before,
had
emma
perez
not
gone
through
bankruptcy,
these
issues
would
have
been
raised.
however,
since
she
has
gone
through
bankruptcy,
the
only
issue
left
is
that
whether
the
bankruptcy
act
gives
her
that
certain
protection.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
i’m
not
abandoning
these
issues.
these
issues
were
not
decided
by
the
lower
court.
these
issues
would
require
a
three-judge
court
at
least
under
the
case
law
as
now
existing
and
that
if
these
issues
were
to
be
decided,
i
believe
at
least
under
existing
case
law,
we
would
have
to
remand
the
case
to
the
lower
court
to
convene
a
three-judge
court.
and
i
don’t
think
that
is
necessary
because
the
supremacy
clause
as
we
know
under
swift
&
company
versus
wickham
does
not
need
a
three-judge
court,
and
the
one-judge
court
has
properly
decided
that
issue.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
yes.
i
believe
that
the
statute
would
be
unconstitutional,
even
if
mrs.
perez
had
not
gone
through
bankruptcy,
but
once
she
had
gone
through
bankruptcy,
she
has
the
added
protection
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
and
the
very
reason
that
the
statute
may
be
unconstitutional,
if
you
had
not
gone
through
bankruptcy
would
be
more
than
enough
to
show
that
the
same
statute
violates
the
bankruptcy
act
and
thus
the
supremacy
clause.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
i’m
not
abandoning
the
claims.
i’m
just
fearful
that
jurisdictionally
this
court
cannot
reach
these
constitutional
issues
being
that
a
three-judge
court
was
not
convened,
and
therefore,
these
issues
were
not
properly
brought
before
this
court.
but
a
one-judge
court
did
rule
on
the
bankruptcy
at
issue,
and
therefore
this
court
can
properly
adjudicate
a
bankruptcy
act
claim.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
that’s
right.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
which
we
don’t
think
it’s
necessary
because
the
bankruptcy
act
is
the
argument
that
we’re
asserting.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
i
don’t
accept
this
statement.
however,
i
think
it
is
unnecessary
to
reach
at
these
issues.
the
court
should
limit
itself
to
resolving
the
issues
that
is
--
the
issue
before
the
court
and
the
bankruptcy
act
claim
is
the
issue,
and
once
having
resolved
the
bankruptcy
act
issue,
it
is
unnecessary
thereafter
to
reach
the
constitutional
issues.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
i
would
say
as
a
secondary
line
of
defense,
i
would
say
that
this
court
can
properly
consider
the
constitutional
issues
whether
they
are
substantial
and
can
remand
the
case
to
the
lower
court
for
a
three-judge
court
to
be
convened
if
this
court
deems
necessary.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
this
is
up
to
this
court.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
exactly,
and
i
propose
to
do
so.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
and
in
addition
to
what
i
pointed
out
as
to
the
criminal
sanctions
vis-à-vis,
the
financial
responsibility
in
my
argument
that
the
statute
really
does
not
protect
the
public
to
ensure
the
safe
driver’s
drive
on
the
highways.
i
think
one
question
which
a
lot
of
people
would
have
in
mind
is
this.
you
know,
we
can’t
allow
these
people
to
drive,
get
into
an
accident,
wipe
out
the
judgment
by
bankruptcy
and
drive
again
and
what’s
going
to
prevent
them
from
doing
this
over
and
over
again?
the
answer,
of
course,
is
that
it
won’t
happen
over
and
over
again
because
the
arizona
statute
also
provides
that
in
order
for
adolfo
perez
to
get
his
license
again,
and
not
only
must
he
pay
the
debt,
but
he
must
also
show
that
he
has
insurance
for
the
future.
and
the
perez’s
are
more
than
willing
to
pay
insurance
for
the
future,
and
therefore,
if
allowed
to
drive,
they’ll
be
actually
financially
more
responsible
than
some
of
the
drivers
on
the
streets
and
highways
in
arizona
who
have
no
insurance.
another
thing
we
must
point
out
in
--
or
to
demonstrate
that
the
statute
is
not
for
the
purposes
of
public
safety.
i’d
like
to
quote
the
arizona
supreme
court
decision
in
schecter
v.
killingsworth
and
this
decision
was
cited
both
by
myself
and
my
opponent,
and
the
arizona
court
in
that
case
that
came
out
in
interpreting
the
financial
responsibility
act
of
arizona
saying
that
the
state
statute
does
not
have
for
its
primary
purpose
the
purpose
of
public
safety.
the
arizona
court
said,
the
financial
responsibility
act
has
for
its
purpose,
the
principle
purpose,
the
protection
of
the
public
using
the
highways
from
financial
hardship
which
may
result
from
the
use
of
automobiles
by
financially
irresponsible
persons.
it
accomplishes
the
objective
by
requiring
proof
of
financial
responsibility
by
those
involved
in
an
accident,
either
by
showing
of
insurance
which
covers
the
accident
or
by
requiring
a
bond
or
deposit
or
cash,
or
security.
it
may
as
incidental
purpose
and
effect
because
of
the
threat
of
loss
of
driving
arise
following
an
insured
accident,
one,
encourage
operators
of
motor
vehicle
to
obtain
liability
insurance
and
two,
encourage
drivers
to
drive
more
carefully.
because
the
uninsured
motorist
can
avoid
the
adverse
effect
of
a
statute
without
obtaining
insurance
and
without
improving
his
driving
skills,
we
cannot
either
--
we
cannot
consider
either
the
encouragement
to
obtain
insurance
or
the
improvement
of
the
safety
conditions
on
the
highways
to
be
the
primary
objective
of
this
law.
and
this
point
was
omitted
by
the
respondent
in
their
brief
as
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
arizona
statute
placed
by
the
arizona
supreme
court.
and
therefore,
it
is
a
well
established
doctrine
that
in
such
a
case,
the
federal
court
must
be
bound
by
the
interpretation
placed
by
the
state’s
highest
court.
i'll
just
cite
one
case
decided
by
this
court
on
that
point,
the
marine
national
exchange
bank
versus
kalt-zimmers
manufacturing
company
in
293
u.s.
357.
that
case,
it’s
also
a
case
involving
bankruptcy
and
it
involves
another
uniform
law,
the
negotiable
instrument
act,
and
involves
the
construction
by
the
state
court
as
to
what
is
at
holder
in
due
course.
and
this
court
said
that
not
withstanding
the
weight
of
thought
to
the
contrary,
the
federal
court
is
bound
by
the
interpretation
placed
by
the
wisconsin
court.
i’d
like
to
point
out
again
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
his
opinion,
at
the
time
when
he
felt
the
driving
is
not
important,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
that
the
--
in
fact,
it’s
only
tangential
as
to
a
driving
that
only
in
particular
cases
when
one
seeks
to
drive
to
restore
his
driver’s
license
and
registration.
i
submit
that
this
is
no
longer
true
that
in
this
day
when
driving
is
such
an
important
right
as
said
by
the
arizona
supreme
court
again
in
the
same
case
schecter
versus
killingsworth,
when
arizona
overruled
a
prior
decision
and
said
“driving
is
no
longer
privileged
for
the
right.”
and
i
submit
that
every
person
whose
license
is
suspended
will
seek
to
have
his
license
restored.
therefore,
the
effect
of
a
statute
is
no
longer
a
tangential.
it
is
very
direct
and
complete
and
its
impact
on
the
bankruptcy
act
is
again
complete.
i
would
like
to
call
attention
to
this
court
as
to
a
recent
case
decided
by
the
third
circuit
on
december
22,
1970
dealing
with
a
point
whether
an
owner
who
was
vicariously
liable
would
have
his
license
suspended,
and
then
after
bankruptcy
can
he
get
the
benefit
of
the
bankruptcy
by
having
his
license
restored.
the
third
circuit
held
that
his
license
should
be
restored.
a
later,
second
circuit
case,
decided
a
couple
of
weeks
ago,
reached
a
contrary
decision.
i
have
not
read
the
second
circuit
opinion,
but
i
like
to
quote
the
opinion
by
the
third
circuit,
the
opinion
by
seven
judges
out
of
nine.
the
opinion
said
“nor
is
the
disability
of
disqualification
from
owning
or
operating
a
motor
vehicle
and
essentially
tangential
impingement
upon
the
purposes
served
by
section
17
of
bankruptcy
act,
one
cannot
ignore
the
facts
of
present
day
urban
existence,
a
combination
of
public
and
private
policies
have
made
use
of
an
automobile
an
actual
necessity
for
virtually
everyone
who
must
work
for
a
living.
for
the
urban
poor
in
particular,
remoteness
from
the
thriving
suburban
segments
of
the
industry,
economy
and
a
deteriorating
public
transportation
system
often
make
use
of
an
automobile,
the
only
practical
alternative
to
welfare.”
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
no.
this
decision
was
just
decided
less
than
a
month
ago.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
it's
39
law
week
2334.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
law
week
2334.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
yes.
it
came
out
in
a
law
week
just
a
week
ago.
i
don’t
have
the
exact
citation,
but
i
was
informed
of
that.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
yes.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
i
don’t
know
how
much
time
is
remaining,
i
would
like
to
reserve
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
rebut
that
mr.
schlosser’s
argument
as
to
ownership
being
not
a
basis
for
the
judgment.
under
the
statute,
defining
judgment
in
the
financial
responsibility
act
28-1102
sub-para
2,
judgment
means
any
judgment
which
has
become
final
etcetera,
by
a
court
etcetera,
upon
a
cause
of
action
arising
out
of
the
ownership,
maintenance
or
use
of
a
motor
vehicle,
if
ownership
is
just
very
much
part
of
the
judgment.
as
to
welfare,
i
would
say
to
the
court
that
there’s
more
likelihood
that
a
judgment
debtor
would
go
on
welfare
than
judgment
creditor.
the
creditors
allow
them
have
insurance
and
the
subjugation
--
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
exactly.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
no,
but
i’m
saying
that
arizona
has
by
statutory
scheme
providing
for
the
uninsured
motorist
provision
for
example,
and
the
insurance
company
pay
off
to
the
victims
and
that
in
the
schecter
case,
the
court
took
about
76%
of
the
motorists
being
insured,
and
therefore
at
least
one
--
three
out
of
four
victims
are
most
likely
have
insurance.
therefore,
those
creditors
pursuing
the
debtors,
three
out
of
four
are
insurance
companies.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
review
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
facts
are
relatively
simple.
the
petitioners
here
are
adolfo
perez
and
his
wife
emma
perez.
they
live
in
tucson,
arizona.
on
july
8,
1965,
adolfo
perez,
while
driving
his
family
car,
had
an
accident.
a
year
or
so
later,
a
lawsuit
was
filed
against
adolfo
perez
and
his
wife
based
on
the
accident.
a
year
or
so
later,
the
perez’s
confessed
judgment
and
the
judgment
was
rendered
against
the
two
of
them
as
husband
and
wife.
thereafter,
adolfo
and
emma
perez
each
filed
a
petition
in
bankruptcy.
the
judgment
was
scheduled
in
each
of
the
bankruptcy
petition,
and
in
due
course
that
that
was
discharged.
however,
arizona
law
provides
that
anyone
who
has
a
judgment
of
this
kind
against
him
would
have
his
driver’s
license
and
automobile
registration
suspended
until
the
judgment
or
a
part
of
it
is
paid.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
yes.
that
judgment
is
in
the
record.
it’s
not
reproduced
in
the
appendix.
however,
it’s
in
the
record
on
page
54
and
55.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
the
confession
judgment
was
entered
by
their
attorney.
they
had
--
this
is
not
in
the
record,
but
i
will
supply
that
information
to
the
court
if
the
court
desires
the
information.
the
perez’s
retained
counsel.
an
answer
was
filed
denying
the
negligence.
on
the
date
of
trial,
counsel
advised
the
perez’s
to
confess
judgment
so
that
he
can
take
them
to
bankruptcy.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
yes,
the
husband
was
alone.
this
was
alleged
in
the
complaint.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
exactly.
in
arizona,
it
is
a
common
practice
in
suing
a
marital
community
to
sue
both
the
husband
and
wife.
the
complaint
is
also
in
the
record,
i
believe
its
page
53
and
54
preceding
the
judgment
in
the
record.
again,
it’s
not
reproduced
in
the
appendix.
the
complaint
named
him
and
django
perez,
his
wife
and
subsequently
the
judgment
recited
emma
perez
since
here
true
name
was
late
unknown.
but
the
complaint
spelled
out
that
the
suit
was
against
adolfo
perez
and
the
marital
community
husband
and
wife.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
that’s
right.
and
so
it’s
a
judgment,
reciting
judgment
against
adolfo
and
emma
perez,
husband
and
wife.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
in
arizona,
the
--
a
suit
can
be
brought
either
against
the
husband
or
against
husband
and
wife.
this
is
entirely
at
the
option
of
the
plaintiff’s
attorney.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
this
is
not
shown
by
any
of
the
case
law
in
arizona
regarding
community
property.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
most
plaintiffs
are
not
willing
to
do
that
because
most
plaintiffs
feel
that
wife
may
have
a
job
and
it
will
be
easier
to
garnish
or
execute
on
the
wife
if
the
complaint
and
the
judgment
reads
the
wife’s
name.
in
other
words,
the
wife’s
earnings
are
the
community
property
during
marriage
and
a
complaint
and
a
judgment
against
husband
and
wife
will
facilitate
the
garnishment
and
execution
of
a
judgment.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
exactly.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
no.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
no,
there’s
no
allegation
in
the
complaint
as
to
that
at
all.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
exactly.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
no.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
that
is
correct.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
the
title
to
the
automobile
is
in
the
name
of
adolfo
perez
only.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
exactly.
the
automobile
is
community
property.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
and
the
wife
has
an
interest
in
it,
although
the
husband
is
the
manager.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
yes,
arizona
permits
the
holding
of
a
personal
property
in
joint
tenancy.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
the
case
will
not
be
any
different
other
than
not
only
the
community
property
of
the
husband
and
wife,
but
also
emma
perez’s
separate
property
will
then
become
liable.
so
in
other
words,
the
joint
property
will
make
it
a
joint
in
several
obligations.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
certainly,
your
honor
and
this
has
been
done
in
three
states:
new
york,
massachusetts
and
north
carolina.
after
surrendering
to
the
state
their
licenses
upon
demand,
the
petitioner’s
filed
a
lawsuit
in
the
district
court.
the
state
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
a
single-judge
granted
their
motion
to
dismiss.
the
case
then
was
appealed
to
the
ninth
circuit,
and
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
the
decision
and
thereafter,
certiorari
was
petitioned
for
--
by
the
petitioners
and
this
court
granted
certiorari.
this
case
involves
a
very
important
and
alleged
conflict
between
a
state
statute
and
the
federal
bankruptcy
act.
this
issue
has
been
before
the
court
twice
within
the
last
20
years,
in
the
case
of
reitz
versus
mealey,
a
new
york
case,
and
kesler
versus
department
of
public
safety,
a
case
coming
from
utah.
the
statue
was
upheld
under
similar
circumstances
as
regarding
adolfo
perez
by
a
divided
court
in
both
cases.
our
argument
here
will
be
that
this
court
should
reexamine
these
earlier
cases
and
after
due
consideration,
overrule
these
cases,
because
they
are
not
logically
sound
and
that
they
are
now
out
of
date
and
also
that
in
applying
arizona
law,
the
rationale
used
by
the
court
previously
is
not
applicable.
in
the
reitz
case
and
in
kesler,
this
court
sustained
a
statute
on
a
basis
that
the
purposes
of
these
statutes
are
to
deter
irresponsible
driving
and
to
promote
public
safety
which
of
course
is
a
valid
exercise
of
the
state’s
police
power.
we
would
urge
the
court
to
consider
our
argument
that
the
statute
really
does
not
deter
irresponsible
driving
and
does
not
protect
the
public
safety.
this
type
of
suspension
is
not
suspension
for
the
conduct
of
negligent
driving,
but
a
suspension
for
the
nonpayment
of
the
judgment.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
the
arizona
statute
has
for
the
purpose
the
financially
irresponsible
drivers
that
it’s
trying
to
reach
and
not
the
drivers
who
are
irresponsible
in
their
conduct.
and
i
will
illustrate
by
pointing
out
to
this
court
that
arizona
as
in
every
state
have
criminal
sanctions
against
irresponsible
driving,
for
drunk
driving,
for
manslaughter,
for
various
violations.
and
yet
under
arizona
law,
no
suspension
can
be
for
more
than
one
year.
even
if
a
person’s
license
is
revoked
for
vehicular
manslaughter
or
for
twice
driving
under
the
influence
of
alcohol
or
drugs,
he
can
apply
to
regain
his
license
after
one
year.
but
in
this
case,
a
person
whose
license
is
suspended
can
not
get
his
license
and
sometimes
permanently
until
he
pays
the
judgment.
this
i
believe
demonstrates
that
public
safety
is
not
what
is
intended
by
the
statute.
the
statue
is
intended
to
collect
the
dept
to
aid
a
victim.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
exactly.
what
i’m
saying
is
that
for
a
person
who
has
insurance
who
is
convicted
for
manslaughter
or
drunk
driving,
his
insurance
company
would
pay
the
judgment
and
he
can
regain
his
license
after
one
year.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
no.
i
said
a
state
can
require
everybody
to
have
insurance.
i’m
only
trying
to
point
out
to
this
court
that
there
is
a
obvious
conflict
with
the
bankruptcy
act.
had
neither
of
these
petitioners
gone
through
bankruptcy,
then
i
would
say
there
are
constitutional
questions,
maybe
surrounding,
especially
emma
perez’s
claim.
but
now
that
both
these
petitioners
have
gone
through
bankruptcy,
they
have
the
shield
of
bankruptcy,
and
therefore,
the
only
conflict
that
needs
to
be
resolved
by
this
court
is
whether
or
not
the
statute
conflicts
with
the
bankruptcy
act.
i’m
not
asking
this
court
to
reach
any
constitutional
decisions
in
this
case.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
as
far
as
mrs.
perez’s
concerned,
i
believe
that
this
court
can
very
well
distinguish
the
kesler
case
on
a
basis
that
the
kesler
case
as
stated
in
the
opinion
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
state
statute
has
for
the
purpose
the
deterring
of
irresponsible
driving
and
that
that
purpose
is
absent
as
far
as
mrs.
perez
is
concerned.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
--
because
she
is
not
a
negligent
driver.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
i’m
not
asking
this
court
to
set
aside
a
state
judgment,
the
state
judgment
is
perfectly
valid.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
because
mrs.
perez
having
gone
through
bankruptcy,
the
judgment
is
duly
discharged
in
bankruptcy.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
yes,
i
believe
that
this
court
can,
because
the
rationale
of
kesler
does
not
cover
persons
such
as
mrs.
perez
who
is
not
--
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
no
that
would
only
require
the
same
approach
under
the
bankruptcy
act
and
the
supremacy
clause.
as
to
mrs.
perez,
there
is
a
clear
conflict
between
the
state
statute
requiring
that
every
person
against
whom
a
judgment
is
rendered
to
surrender
the
license
and
the
federal
bankruptcy
act.
a
clear
conflict
has
emerged
and
absent
the
rationale
in
kesler
as
pertaining
to
the
negligent
driver,
mrs.
perez
must
have
the
cloak
of
protection
of
the
federal
bankruptcy
act.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
exactly.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
no.
it
is
not
necessary
to
reach
this
argument
because
as
i’ve
said
before,
had
emma
perez
not
gone
through
bankruptcy,
these
issues
would
have
been
raised.
however,
since
she
has
gone
through
bankruptcy,
the
only
issue
left
is
that
whether
the
bankruptcy
act
gives
her
that
certain
protection.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
i’m
not
abandoning
these
issues.
these
issues
were
not
decided
by
the
lower
court.
these
issues
would
require
a
three-judge
court
at
least
under
the
case
law
as
now
existing
and
that
if
these
issues
were
to
be
decided,
i
believe
at
least
under
existing
case
law,
we
would
have
to
remand
the
case
to
the
lower
court
to
convene
a
three-judge
court.
and
i
don’t
think
that
is
necessary
because
the
supremacy
clause
as
we
know
under
swift
&
company
versus
wickham
does
not
need
a
three-judge
court,
and
the
one-judge
court
has
properly
decided
that
issue.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
yes.
i
believe
that
the
statute
would
be
unconstitutional,
even
if
mrs.
perez
had
not
gone
through
bankruptcy,
but
once
she
had
gone
through
bankruptcy,
she
has
the
added
protection
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
and
the
very
reason
that
the
statute
may
be
unconstitutional,
if
you
had
not
gone
through
bankruptcy
would
be
more
than
enough
to
show
that
the
same
statute
violates
the
bankruptcy
act
and
thus
the
supremacy
clause.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
i’m
not
abandoning
the
claims.
i’m
just
fearful
that
jurisdictionally
this
court
cannot
reach
these
constitutional
issues
being
that
a
three-judge
court
was
not
convened,
and
therefore,
these
issues
were
not
properly
brought
before
this
court.
but
a
one-judge
court
did
rule
on
the
bankruptcy
at
issue,
and
therefore
this
court
can
properly
adjudicate
a
bankruptcy
act
claim.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
that’s
right.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
which
we
don’t
think
it’s
necessary
because
the
bankruptcy
act
is
the
argument
that
we’re
asserting.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
i
don’t
accept
this
statement.
however,
i
think
it
is
unnecessary
to
reach
at
these
issues.
the
court
should
limit
itself
to
resolving
the
issues
that
is
--
the
issue
before
the
court
and
the
bankruptcy
act
claim
is
the
issue,
and
once
having
resolved
the
bankruptcy
act
issue,
it
is
unnecessary
thereafter
to
reach
the
constitutional
issues.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
i
would
say
as
a
secondary
line
of
defense,
i
would
say
that
this
court
can
properly
consider
the
constitutional
issues
whether
they
are
substantial
and
can
remand
the
case
to
the
lower
court
for
a
three-judge
court
to
be
convened
if
this
court
deems
necessary.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
this
is
up
to
this
court.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
exactly,
and
i
propose
to
do
so.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
and
in
addition
to
what
i
pointed
out
as
to
the
criminal
sanctions
vis-à-vis,
the
financial
responsibility
in
my
argument
that
the
statute
really
does
not
protect
the
public
to
ensure
the
safe
driver’s
drive
on
the
highways.
i
think
one
question
which
a
lot
of
people
would
have
in
mind
is
this.
you
know,
we
can’t
allow
these
people
to
drive,
get
into
an
accident,
wipe
out
the
judgment
by
bankruptcy
and
drive
again
and
what’s
going
to
prevent
them
from
doing
this
over
and
over
again?
the
answer,
of
course,
is
that
it
won’t
happen
over
and
over
again
because
the
arizona
statute
also
provides
that
in
order
for
adolfo
perez
to
get
his
license
again,
and
not
only
must
he
pay
the
debt,
but
he
must
also
show
that
he
has
insurance
for
the
future.
and
the
perez’s
are
more
than
willing
to
pay
insurance
for
the
future,
and
therefore,
if
allowed
to
drive,
they’ll
be
actually
financially
more
responsible
than
some
of
the
drivers
on
the
streets
and
highways
in
arizona
who
have
no
insurance.
another
thing
we
must
point
out
in
--
or
to
demonstrate
that
the
statute
is
not
for
the
purposes
of
public
safety.
i’d
like
to
quote
the
arizona
supreme
court
decision
in
schecter
v.
killingsworth
and
this
decision
was
cited
both
by
myself
and
my
opponent,
and
the
arizona
court
in
that
case
that
came
out
in
interpreting
the
financial
responsibility
act
of
arizona
saying
that
the
state
statute
does
not
have
for
its
primary
purpose
the
purpose
of
public
safety.
the
arizona
court
said,
the
financial
responsibility
act
has
for
its
purpose,
the
principle
purpose,
the
protection
of
the
public
using
the
highways
from
financial
hardship
which
may
result
from
the
use
of
automobiles
by
financially
irresponsible
persons.
it
accomplishes
the
objective
by
requiring
proof
of
financial
responsibility
by
those
involved
in
an
accident,
either
by
showing
of
insurance
which
covers
the
accident
or
by
requiring
a
bond
or
deposit
or
cash,
or
security.
it
may
as
incidental
purpose
and
effect
because
of
the
threat
of
loss
of
driving
arise
following
an
insured
accident,
one,
encourage
operators
of
motor
vehicle
to
obtain
liability
insurance
and
two,
encourage
drivers
to
drive
more
carefully.
because
the
uninsured
motorist
can
avoid
the
adverse
effect
of
a
statute
without
obtaining
insurance
and
without
improving
his
driving
skills,
we
cannot
either
--
we
cannot
consider
either
the
encouragement
to
obtain
insurance
or
the
improvement
of
the
safety
conditions
on
the
highways
to
be
the
primary
objective
of
this
law.
and
this
point
was
omitted
by
the
respondent
in
their
brief
as
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
arizona
statute
placed
by
the
arizona
supreme
court.
and
therefore,
it
is
a
well
established
doctrine
that
in
such
a
case,
the
federal
court
must
be
bound
by
the
interpretation
placed
by
the
state’s
highest
court.
i'll
just
cite
one
case
decided
by
this
court
on
that
point,
the
marine
national
exchange
bank
versus
kalt-zimmers
manufacturing
company
in
293
u.s.
357.
that
case,
it’s
also
a
case
involving
bankruptcy
and
it
involves
another
uniform
law,
the
negotiable
instrument
act,
and
involves
the
construction
by
the
state
court
as
to
what
is
at
holder
in
due
course.
and
this
court
said
that
not
withstanding
the
weight
of
thought
to
the
contrary,
the
federal
court
is
bound
by
the
interpretation
placed
by
the
wisconsin
court.
i’d
like
to
point
out
again
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
his
opinion,
at
the
time
when
he
felt
the
driving
is
not
important,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
that
the
--
in
fact,
it’s
only
tangential
as
to
a
driving
that
only
in
particular
cases
when
one
seeks
to
drive
to
restore
his
driver’s
license
and
registration.
i
submit
that
this
is
no
longer
true
that
in
this
day
when
driving
is
such
an
important
right
as
said
by
the
arizona
supreme
court
again
in
the
same
case
schecter
versus
killingsworth,
when
arizona
overruled
a
prior
decision
and
said
“driving
is
no
longer
privileged
for
the
right.”
and
i
submit
that
every
person
whose
license
is
suspended
will
seek
to
have
his
license
restored.
therefore,
the
effect
of
a
statute
is
no
longer
a
tangential.
it
is
very
direct
and
complete
and
its
impact
on
the
bankruptcy
act
is
again
complete.
i
would
like
to
call
attention
to
this
court
as
to
a
recent
case
decided
by
the
third
circuit
on
december
22,
1970
dealing
with
a
point
whether
an
owner
who
was
vicariously
liable
would
have
his
license
suspended,
and
then
after
bankruptcy
can
he
get
the
benefit
of
the
bankruptcy
by
having
his
license
restored.
the
third
circuit
held
that
his
license
should
be
restored.
a
later,
second
circuit
case,
decided
a
couple
of
weeks
ago,
reached
a
contrary
decision.
i
have
not
read
the
second
circuit
opinion,
but
i
like
to
quote
the
opinion
by
the
third
circuit,
the
opinion
by
seven
judges
out
of
nine.
the
opinion
said
“nor
is
the
disability
of
disqualification
from
owning
or
operating
a
motor
vehicle
and
essentially
tangential
impingement
upon
the
purposes
served
by
section
17
of
bankruptcy
act,
one
cannot
ignore
the
facts
of
present
day
urban
existence,
a
combination
of
public
and
private
policies
have
made
use
of
an
automobile
an
actual
necessity
for
virtually
everyone
who
must
work
for
a
living.
for
the
urban
poor
in
particular,
remoteness
from
the
thriving
suburban
segments
of
the
industry,
economy
and
a
deteriorating
public
transportation
system
often
make
use
of
an
automobile,
the
only
practical
alternative
to
welfare.”
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
no.
this
decision
was
just
decided
less
than
a
month
ago.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
it's
39
law
week
2334.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
law
week
2334.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
yes.
it
came
out
in
a
law
week
just
a
week
ago.
i
don’t
have
the
exact
citation,
but
i
was
informed
of
that.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
yes.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
i
don’t
know
how
much
time
is
remaining,
i
would
like
to
reserve
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
rebut
that
mr.
schlosser’s
argument
as
to
ownership
being
not
a
basis
for
the
judgment.
under
the
statute,
defining
judgment
in
the
financial
responsibility
act
28-1102
sub-para
2,
judgment
means
any
judgment
which
has
become
final
etcetera,
by
a
court
etcetera,
upon
a
cause
of
action
arising
out
of
the
ownership,
maintenance
or
use
of
a
motor
vehicle,
if
ownership
is
just
very
much
part
of
the
judgment.
as
to
welfare,
i
would
say
to
the
court
that
there’s
more
likelihood
that
a
judgment
debtor
would
go
on
welfare
than
judgment
creditor.
the
creditors
allow
them
have
insurance
and
the
subjugation
--
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
exactly.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
no,
but
i’m
saying
that
arizona
has
by
statutory
scheme
providing
for
the
uninsured
motorist
provision
for
example,
and
the
insurance
company
pay
off
to
the
victims
and
that
in
the
schecter
case,
the
court
took
about
76%
of
the
motorists
being
insured,
and
therefore
at
least
one
--
three
out
of
four
victims
are
most
likely
have
insurance.
therefore,
those
creditors
pursuing
the
debtors,
three
out
of
four
are
insurance
companies.
