justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
you
could
prevail
on
this
case
without
overruling
kesler
as
far
as
emma
perez
is
concerned?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
then
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
basis
then
would
there
be
for
us
to
set
aside
the
judgment
as
to
mrs.
perez,
state
judgment?
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
i
mean
the
license.
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
would
that
--
this
presupposes
that
this
court
is
going
to
overrule
kesler.
now,
i’m
asking
you
if
kesler
is
still
remains
on
the
books,
do
you
think
you
have
a
claim
as
far
as
mrs.
perez
is
concerned
on
the
theory
that
the
rationale
of
kesler
didn’t
reach
one
circumstance,
as
mrs.
perez
was?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
ground
would
that
be
on?
would
that
involve
a
constitutional
approach?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
you
have
to
do
that
to
the
jurisdiction
is
a
problem?
justice
john
m.
harlan
otherwise,
you
would
have
to
go
back
and
start
all
over
again?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
accept,
in
other
words,
for
you
argument
the
premise
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
three-judge
court
or
of
the
court
of
appeals,
both
of
them
that
these
other
constitutional
questions
are
in
substantial
and
therefore
not
sufficiently
required
a
three-judge
court?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
justice
blackmun’s
question
in
a
different
way,
it’s
what
i
find
the
precedent.
suppose
you
don’t
prevail
on
your
supremacy
clause
there,
then
do
you
--
are
you
arguing
here
the
--
are
you
abandoning
or
you
still
maintaining
the
due
process
or
equal
protection?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
would
have
to
go
back?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
suppose
the
theory
is,
isn’t
it
that
if
he
seriously
hurt,
he
can’t
work,
he
may
become
an
object
of
welfare?
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
do
you
think
that
law
brings
this
out?
