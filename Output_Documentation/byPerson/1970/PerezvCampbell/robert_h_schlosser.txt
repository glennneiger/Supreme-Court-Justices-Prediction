mr.
robert

schlosser
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
--
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
might
first
state
that
as
the
court
is
well
aware,
there
have
been
two
women’s
lib
groups
who
have
filed
amicus
curiae
in
this
particular
action.
i
did
not
respond
to
the
amicus
curiae
in
my
answering
brief
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
notification
concerning
the
granting
of
the
original
amicus
curiae
brief
was
not
received
until
my
brief
was
in
preparation
on
its
way
to
the
printers.
notification
as
to
the
second
one
of
which
i
feel
a
response,
a
written
response
would
definitely
is
more
deserve
it,
was
not
received
in
my
office
until
january
13
this
year.
for
that
reason,
i
will
attempt
to
cover
these
briefs
in
oral
argument,
especially
the
one
from
the
organization
located
in
tucson,
arizona
and
would
request
that
if
the
court
deemed
necessary
as
based
upon
different
citations,
which
i
will
utilize
in
the
oral
argument
that
they
might
see
fit
to
grant
leave
to
file
either
an
additional
authorities
and/or
maybe
a
short
answering
brief
directed
towards
the
amicus
curiae
briefs.
i
would
like
first
to
briefly
and
devote
actually
a
much
smaller
portion
of
my
argument
to
the
overall
issue
as
challenge
concerning
the
--
whether
or
not
to
overrule
kesler
and
reitz
and
reserve
a
primary
portion
of
my
argument
or
rather
at
the
latter
port
--
part
of
the
argument,
go
into
the
issue
concerning
emma,
which
is
by
far
the
more
novel
and
interesting
issue
possibly
here.
now
as
mr.
ching
has
pointed
out
and
has
stated
and
i
think
in
both
briefs
that
various
lip
service
has
been
given
to
the
type
of
statute
which
is
challenged
here,
the
type
of
statute
which
is
challenged
here
has
been
enacted
at
least
at
one
time
in
45
or
more
of
our
states.
this
is
based
on
a
uniform
act
with
local
state
adoptions.
the
public
purposes
justifying
such
statutes
have
been
enumerated
as
follows:
one,
a
deterrent
to
unsafe
driving.
number
two;
a
very
nebulous
to
protect
others
using
the
highways.
number
three
and
as
mentioned
most
specifically
by
arizona,
to
keep
persons
who
may
be
injured
by
the
financially
irresponsible
utilizing
of
the
highways
off
of
our
welfare
roles
and
four;
the
mention
has
been
made
to
encourage
insurance.
arizona
does
can
at
least
state
that
in
their
estimation,
the
primary
purpose
of
this
particular
statute
in
the
arizona
supreme
court’s
estimation
when
they
wrote
the
schecter
case
was
to
keep
persons
who
may
be
injured
by
the
financially
irresponsible
off
the
welfare
roles.
gentlemen,
i
don’t
think
that
whether
arizona
states
that,
they
also
did
mention
the
incidental
purposes.
i
don’t
think
that
arizona’s
placing
its
emphasis
as
far
as
it
was
concerned
on
that
particular
element
or
alleged
public
purpose
in
anyway
should
govern
whether
or
not
this
statute
is
held
constitutional
or
unconstitutional
or
violative
or
un-violative
of
the
supremacy
clause.
the
reason
why
i
say
that
is,
this
is
the
--
challenged
portion
of
this
statute
is
all
but
verbatim,
the
statute
which
was
challenged
in
reitz
and
the
statute
which
was
challenged
in
kesler.
and
because
arizona
says
“of
the
various
purposes,
we
happen
to
think
this
one
is
the
more
valid”
is
no
reason
for
this
court
to
feel
that
we
are
talking
about
a
different
statute.
and
to
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
the
primary,
i
understand
correctly,
thank
you.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
i’m
suggesting
that
we
are
talking
about
the
same
statute.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
i
would
have
to
agree
with
that.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
i
don’t
feel
that
if
you
feel
the
statutes
are
substantially
the
same
for
the
purposes
of
judging
the
supremacy
argument,
that
arizona
is
classifying
one
as
primary
and
others
as
incidental
should
be
binding
upon
this
court.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
yes.
in
this
particular
--
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
may
i
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
the
schecter
case
as
i
recall,
the
particular
suspension
which
was
discussed
there
was
what
the
prejudgment
suspension.
the
suspension
which
is
prior
to
any
judgment
being
enlarged
where
a
determination
is
made
upon
the
reasonable
possibility
of
judgment
by
the
director
of
the
financial
responsibility
section
with
a
provision
for
appeal
from
his
determination,
wherein
he
also
sets
a
bond
and
the
instant
case
deals
with
a
post
judgment
suspension
where
the
liability
issues
and
so
forth
have
been
clear.
now
if
that
provides
a
distinction,
i’m
not
certain
other
than
that
the
bond
is
there,
i
would
tend
to
agree
with
this
court
concerning
the
primary
purpose
of
the
statute
concerned
as
opposed
to
the
arizona
court.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
that’s
--
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
that’s
my
understanding
of
the
decision,
excuse
me?
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
no
it’s
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
no,
it’s
the
third
person
victim.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
yes.
that
is
--
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
well
--
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
that
is
true.
but
--
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
however,
you’re
presupposing
facts
that
we’re
not
in
issue
in
the
schecter
case.
first
of
all,
there
was
no
discussion
of
whether
or
not
the
person
was
judgment
of
proof.
in
that
case,
they
were
imposing
a
bond.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
in
the
instant
case?
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
that’s
the
allegation
of
the
petitioner,
yes
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
well,
i
have
to
dispute
with
the
facts
that
if
you’re
basing
them
on
a
ninth
circuit
opinion
also
your
honor,
which
i
will
cover
in
the
emma
portion
of
my
oral
argument.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
well,
might
i
say
briefly
in
answer
to
that
and
i
doubt
that
it
will
satisfy
you.
i’m
not
so
sure
i’m
satisfied
with
the
arizona
explanation.
i
might
say
kesler
was
talking
about
a
prejudgment
situation
where
they
were
trying
to
extract
a
bond.
number
two,
it
may
not
be
every
situation
where
you
have
a
person
who
is
impecunious
or
indigent
who
is
the
person
subjected,
you
do
have
stubborn
people
who
maybe
refuse
to
get
insurance
and
refuse
to
maybe
protect
themselves
as
they
should,
but
who
are
not
necessarily
ones
who
are
indigent.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
that
is
a
rational
theory.
i’m
not
so
certain
of
the
wisdom
of
it.
i
might
point
out
that
congress
has
enacted
similar
legislation
for
the
district
of
columbia
as
well.
as
to
the
theory
which
you
propose
being
a
rational
theory,
i
would
definitely
agree
that,
that
is
probably
one
of
their
motives,
but
that
whether
or
not
it
is
effective
or
not,
is
subject
to
speculation.
now,
if
a
--
i
might
say
that
one
of
the
valid
purposes
which
has
been
mentioned,
but
never
discussed
in
any
full
degree
in
any
of
the
cases
i’ve
read
is
to
encourage
the
obtaining
of
insurance
or
the
posting
of
surety
bonds.
these
as
in
arizona
and
in
many
states
which
don’t
have
compulsory
insurance,
rental
agencies,
persons
who
contract
for
a
hire
and
so
forth,
are
often
required
to
do
and
treat
it
in
a
different
class
because
of
their
inordinate
and
use
of
highway
looking
toward
direct
pecuniary
gain.
i
might
say
that
a
complete
reversal
or
detraction
of
the
reverse
of
rights
kesler
position,
i
think
would
leave
us
in
a
position
to
where
as
a
practical
matter,
your
marginal
owner
would
be
maybe
financially
ahead
to
not
purchase
insurance
and
save
a
few
dollars
aside
to
pay
for
his
bankruptcy
discharge.
and
then
as
long
as
he’s
often
off
--
does
not
have
an
accident
for
another
six
years,
he’s
safe
again.
now,
i
would
like
to
direct
the
balance
of
my
comment
and
my
time,
i
believe
to,
with
the
exception
of
a
very
short
summary,
to
the
emma
perez
situation.
thus
far
we’ve
had
three
briefs
filed,
as
far
as
i’m
concerned,
and
an
opinion
written
by
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
that
is
entirely
in
error
concerning
law
and
facts,
concerning
emma
perez.
there
are
certain
aspects
and
basic
doctrines
of
community
property
law
and
tort
liability
law
in
arizona
that
best
be
explained.
the
first
one
is
that,
number
one,
in
arizona,
mere
ownership
of
a
vehicle
is
not
grounds
for
liability
against
the
owner
by
a
borrower,
negligently
driving
the
same.
secondly,
in
arizona
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
wife
to
be
a
party
to
a
judgment
versus
the
husband
for
driving
of
the
community
vehicle.
the
case
of
bristol
versus
moser
which
is
in
99
p.2nd
706,
in
the
case
of
first
national
bank
versus
reeves
which
is
on
234
pacific
556,
both
arizona
cases,
have
held
that
a
community,
let’s
assume
mr.
perez
is
on
a
community
errand.
i’ll
give
mr.
ching
that
much,
although
i
don’t
know
that
that
was
established
in
the
record
or
the
appendix.
mr.
perez
is
driving
a
community
vehicle
on
a
community
errand,
nevertheless,
pursuant
to
emma’s
contention,
she
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
accident
other
than
she
was
misfortunate
enough
to
be
married
to
an
uninsured,
non-negligent
community
property
husband
negligently
driving
her
community
--
the
community
property
vehicle.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
yes.
mrs.
perez
confessed
judgment,
if
she
is
to
be
believed
and
her
allegations
concerning
no
liability
at
all,
confessed
a
judgment
which
the
law
could
not
have
imposed
upon
her
had
she
chosen,
or
had
her
lawyer
advised
her
to
contest
it.
in
the
first
national
bank
versus
reeves
or
the
bristol
case
and
i
can’t
recall
which
one
of
them
says
“the
husband
is
the
only
indispensable
party
to
such
a
judgment.
the
other
one
vacated
a
judgment
versus
the
wife
and
husband
on
a
community
obligation.”
the
case
of
mortensen
v.
knight
in
arizona
deals
with
whether
or
not
parties
are
inversely
responsible
for
their
spouse's
negligent
operation
of
a
community
vehicle.
in
mortensen
v.
knight,
the
wife
was
the
negligent
driver,
the
husband
--
liability
was
imposed
against
the
husband,
on
a
theory
of
ownership,
no.
liability,
not
directly.
liability
was
imposed
against
the
husband
for
the
following
reason.
he
was
a
co-owner
because
it
was
community
vehicle,
yes,
but
the
court
said
“that
isn’t
enough.”
he
is
imposed
with
liability
because
arizona
makes
him
the
exclusive
agent
and
manager
of
the
community
that
was
a
community
vehicle.
he
had
a
right
to
control
his
wife.
conversely
as
pointed
out
in
all
these
briefs
filed
by
the
amicus
curiae
women’s
lib
groups,
conversely
by
that
very
own
arizona
opinion,
mrs.
perez
did
no
right
to
control
what
mr.
perez
did
because
she
has
no
right
to
control
the
utilization
of
community
property
contrary
to
her
husband’s
wishes,
and
consequently
could
not
have
been
held
liable.
the
law
imposes
a
suspension
versus
persons
who
are
not
owners
or
not
drivers
or
not
ones
who
maintain
vehicles.
the
suspension
is
imposed
against
persons
who
are
judgment
debtors
as
a
result
of
that
type
of
relationship
that
does
not
presuppose
that
someone
who
has
that
type
of
relationship
to
a
vehicle
is
going
to
be
a
judgment
debtor.
and
i
maintain
based
on
the
decisions
cited,
mortensen
v.
knight
incidentally
i’m
sorry
is
305
pacific
2nd
463,
and
peterson
v.
feldman
dealing
with
mere
ownership
is
not
sufficient
to
impose
liability
is
436
pacific
2nd
169,
once
again
both
arizona
cases.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
no
they’re
not
your
honor.
these
are
primarily
in
response
to
the
argument
which
is
set
out
in
the
amicus
curiae
brief
from
tucson.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
i
would
like
if
the
court
grant
leave
to
supplement
my
brief
either
by
just
giving
you
an
official
list
of
these
authorities
which
i
cite
in
my
opinion,
or
a
brief,
supplemental
answering
brief
in
response
to
the
amicus
curiae,
whichever
the
court
please.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
thank
you,
thank
you
i
appreciate
that.
so
basically,
my
contention
is
emma
perez
confessed
judgment
on
bad
advice
when
had
she
not
confessed
judgment,
she
could’ve
received
summary
judgment
if
she
could’ve
established
the
facts
which
she
asked
this
court
to
rely
on.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
i
regret
to
say
that
if
this
were
a
prejudgment
situation,
you
have
a
review.
the
post
judgment
suspension
relies
on
the
due
process
procedures
which
are
afforded
in
your
tortuous
action
tribunal.
consequently,
by
confessing
judgment
and
then
by
not
entering
an
appeal,
there
is
no
forum
now
and
it
is
--
the
judgment
is
a
judgment
to
that
extent.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
could
--
i’m
not
certain
i
followed
your
question
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
no.
arizona
--
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
i
don’t
believe
so
your
honor.
i
believe
that
arizona
would
certainly
feel
bound
by
the
kesler
decision
which
makes
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
i
would
have
to
say
my
answer
with
that
would
be
in
the
affirmative,
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
i
would
say
that
that
is
the
prevailing
practice.
however,
if
i
--
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
yes,
but
i
don’t
--
that
does
not
alter
what
is
the
law
in
arizona
and
there’s
one
other
factor
that
entertains
this
subject
when
you
sue
both
husband
and
wife
and
get
a
judgment
against
both
husband
and
wife.
if
you
have
a
negligent
husband
driving,
you
sue
him
and
you
sue
husband
and
--
excuse
me,
if
you
sue
him,
you
have
a
judgment
versus
the
community
if
he’s
on
a
community
errand,
and
you
have
a
judgment
versus
his
separate
property.
if
you
join
the
wife,
not
only
is
she
subjecting
her
community,
but
there’s
very
good
argument
even
if
they
want
to
characterize
it
“husband
and
wife”
after
their
judgment
heading
that
you’ve
also
got
her
separate
property
too,
for
something
that
should
not
in
anyway
be
affected
as
long
as
she
was
not
negligent,
did
not
have
any
power
to
control
the
operation
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
that’s
right
and
they
relied
on
bad
attorney’s
advice
in
the
lower
court,
the
same
advice
which
was
to
confess
judgment
and
go
through
bankruptcy.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
it
brings
us
to
a
situation,
i
believe
your
honor,
[attempt
to
laughter]
where
as
far
as
relief
for
mrs.
perez.
there’s
one
factor
which
is
later
on
in
my
notes,
but
i
might
mention
it
i
--
this
may
not
be
justice,
but
i
don’t
know
what
to
do,
what
the
law
can
do
about
people
who
confess
liability
to
actions
they’re
not
liable
for
and
then
let
their
appeal
time
run.
now,
this
is
a
sanction
which
they
relied
on.
they
relied
on
an
attorney
who
gave
them
advice
contrary
to
a
statute
which
at
least
at
the
time
of
his
advice
had
been
held
constitutional
or
like
counter
part
had.
i
don’t
know
what
to
--
what
advice
to
offer
them
other
than
the
fact
that
the
procedure
set
out
in

had
never
been
utilized
in
this
case,
which
is
a
method
for
these
people
to
have
their
license
returned
and
i
would
call
the
court’s
attention
to
that.
arizona
is
unique,
i
think,
as
compared
to
the
other
states
who
have
this
because
in
reviewing,
some
of
the
other
states
who
have
statutes
based
on
the
uniform
safety
responsibility
act,
arizona
is
one
of
the
few
that
in
working
out
an
installment
plan
does
not
only
have
the
situation
where
you
can
have
concurrence
of
the
person
who
was
injured.
in
other
words,
you
can
have
your
license
returned
in
arizona
in
a
superior
court’s
discretion
by
petitioning
that
court,
filing
or
servicing
notice
on
the
injured
persons,
the
persons
who
would
have
a
right
to
object
or
be
the
real
party
in
interest,
actually.
and
you
can
go
into
that
court,
put
on
a
showing
as
to
your
ability
to
pay,
and
that
court
can
set
installment
payments.
i
would
surmise,
it
is
much
like
a
support
proceeding
for
fathers
who’ve
divorces
--
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
the
party
in
interest
pursuant
to
the
arizona
statutes,
and
i
would
be
less
than
candid
if
i
told
you
different,
were
still
be
victims
of
the
accident.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
bankruptcy
merely
precludes
those
people
from
utilizing
any
technical
aspects
in
collecting
that
judgment,
no
garnishments
or
executions.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
all
they
can
do
is
--
different
than
utah.
in
utah,
they
instigate
the
action.
in
arizona,
they
can
relieve
the
party
or
a
court
can
relieve
the
party
over
their
objection.
if
the
court
orders
them
to
pay
installment
payments
in
his
discretion
and
they
keep
up
their
installment
payments.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
i
believe
that’s
right.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
oh,
the
creditor
your
honor?
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
oh!
yes.
see,
i
was
a
little
confused
in
terminology.
he
doesn’t
have
the
right
to
keep
you
from
getting
it,
but
he
does.
we’re
playing
semantics
now
and
probably
i
am
with
you.
he
has
the
right
to
allow
you
off
the
hook
as
opposed
to
--
he
doesn’t
invoke
it.
i
might
be
playing
a
word
game
with
you,
i’m
afraid
possibly
i
am.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
i
might
point
out
to
the
court
that
we
have
--
mr.
ching
has
admitted
that
you
can
require
compulsory
insurance.
he’s
also
--
i
would
feel
by
this
same
admission,his
objection
is
to
the
creditor,
the
creditor’s
power
in
this
situation.
what
if
we
had
a
statute
in
arizona
which
said
you
get
in
an
accident
and
you
don’t
show
us
that
you
had
insurance
or
some
other
funds,
deposit
on
that
date
of
that
accident,
you
loose
your
license
automatically;
nothing
about
creditors,
nothing
about
bankruptcy,
or
anything
else.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
that’s
true.
the
creditor
does
have
power
to
relieve,
also
the
superior
court
does
your
honor,
based
on
conditional
payments
which
either
the
creditor
could
waive
if
he’d
wanted
to.
we
can
expect,
it’s
impractical,
but
they
could
relieve
on
an
installment
plan.
this
is
--
we
talk
about
whether
customarily
used.
they
also
have
the
power
where
you
have
a
creditor
who
is
over
bearing.
the
superior
court
does
have
the
power
under
the
areas
of
2011
65
section,
to
set
monthly
payments
in
his
discretion.
i
merely
point
out
to
the
court
the
admissions,
concerning
insurance
as
a
compulsory,
prerequisite
and
so
forth.
and
once
again,
i
still
have
to
admit
that
i
am
somewhat
baffled
as
our
respondents
who
i
represent,
how
a
person
can
admit
that
this
could
be
required
as
a
precondition
to
issuance
of
the
license,
yet
a
less
severe
restriction
is
unconstitutional.
now
--
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
that’s
true,
that’s
true.
i’m
referring
to
characterization
and
our
argument
--
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
yes.
i
might
point
out
on
the
brief
from
the
woman
center
in
los
angeles,
one
of
the
amicus
curiae
briefs.
in
brief
response
to
that,
once
again
they
are
relying
on
the
fact
which
was
pointed
in
ninth
circuit
erroneously
that
emma
perez
is
an
established
fact
was
non-negligent.
only
mr.
ching’s
assertion
concerning
the
complaint
that
we
know
that
she’s
not
negligent.
not
being
in
the
car
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
you’re
guilty
of
nonfeasance
or
in
fact
misfeasance.
there
are
innumerable
factual
situations
where
this
could’ve
been
imposed.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
i
would
think
so.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
i
would
think
so.
i
would
--
that
what
would
be
my
position
right
or
wrong
as
to
these
facts.
secondly,
the
court
of
appeals
did
rely
on
a
case
by
the
name
of
donato
versus
fishburn
to
say
the
wife
is
bound
to
join
in
this
judgment.
gentlemen,
i
have
reread
donato
versus
fishburn.
i
don’t
know
where
the
court
of
appeals
came
to
that
conclusion,
it
certainly
not
in
the
case.
all
it
talks
about
is
executing
versus
the
community
based
on
a
judgment.
there’s
no
discussion
in
there
whatsoever
concerning
whether
or
not
a
wife
has
to
be
or
does
not
have
to
be,
any
discussion
concerning
proper,
necessary
indispensable
parties
in
a
community
property
situation.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
yes,
if
you’re
taking
about
the
supremacy
clause,
definitely.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
we
do
have
--
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
yes,
but
we
do
have
other
contentions
in
the
various
other
briefs
and
we
also
have
some
erroneous
conclusions
in
the
ninth
circuit
brief
which
i
did
want
to
make
sure
the
court
was
clarified
as
to
my
position.
yes,
i
would
agree.
i
personally
think,
for
instance
mr.
ching
mentioned
that
he’s
going
--
first
his
brief
talks
about
perez’s
and
then
he
says
“in
addition,
here
is
emma”,
and
then
he
says
“emma’s
innocent.”
therefore,
i
personally
think
innocent,
not
innocent,
owner,
driver,
what
have
you
if
it
violates
the
supremacy
clause
because
the
suspension
isn’t
discharged,
it
doesn’t
make
any
difference.
if
she’s
innocent
or
if
she
was
guilty
of
all
the
gross
negligence
because
of
course,
that
can’t
be
discharged
--
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
--
well
for
moment,
excuse
me,
but
the
distinction
in
relationship,
i
don’t
think
has
any
validity
if
the
supremacy
what
we’re
talking
about.
my
time
is
up.
i
want
to
thank
you
for
your
time.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
--
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
might
first
state
that
as
the
court
is
well
aware,
there
have
been
two
women’s
lib
groups
who
have
filed
amicus
curiae
in
this
particular
action.
i
did
not
respond
to
the
amicus
curiae
in
my
answering
brief
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
notification
concerning
the
granting
of
the
original
amicus
curiae
brief
was
not
received
until
my
brief
was
in
preparation
on
its
way
to
the
printers.
notification
as
to
the
second
one
of
which
i
feel
a
response,
a
written
response
would
definitely
is
more
deserve
it,
was
not
received
in
my
office
until
january
13
this
year.
for
that
reason,
i
will
attempt
to
cover
these
briefs
in
oral
argument,
especially
the
one
from
the
organization
located
in
tucson,
arizona
and
would
request
that
if
the
court
deemed
necessary
as
based
upon
different
citations,
which
i
will
utilize
in
the
oral
argument
that
they
might
see
fit
to
grant
leave
to
file
either
an
additional
authorities
and/or
maybe
a
short
answering
brief
directed
towards
the
amicus
curiae
briefs.
i
would
like
first
to
briefly
and
devote
actually
a
much
smaller
portion
of
my
argument
to
the
overall
issue
as
challenge
concerning
the
--
whether
or
not
to
overrule
kesler
and
reitz
and
reserve
a
primary
portion
of
my
argument
or
rather
at
the
latter
port
--
part
of
the
argument,
go
into
the
issue
concerning
emma,
which
is
by
far
the
more
novel
and
interesting
issue
possibly
here.
now
as
mr.
ching
has
pointed
out
and
has
stated
and
i
think
in
both
briefs
that
various
lip
service
has
been
given
to
the
type
of
statute
which
is
challenged
here,
the
type
of
statute
which
is
challenged
here
has
been
enacted
at
least
at
one
time
in
45
or
more
of
our
states.
this
is
based
on
a
uniform
act
with
local
state
adoptions.
the
public
purposes
justifying
such
statutes
have
been
enumerated
as
follows:
one,
a
deterrent
to
unsafe
driving.
number
two;
a
very
nebulous
to
protect
others
using
the
highways.
number
three
and
as
mentioned
most
specifically
by
arizona,
to
keep
persons
who
may
be
injured
by
the
financially
irresponsible
utilizing
of
the
highways
off
of
our
welfare
roles
and
four;
the
mention
has
been
made
to
encourage
insurance.
arizona
does
can
at
least
state
that
in
their
estimation,
the
primary
purpose
of
this
particular
statute
in
the
arizona
supreme
court’s
estimation
when
they
wrote
the
schecter
case
was
to
keep
persons
who
may
be
injured
by
the
financially
irresponsible
off
the
welfare
roles.
gentlemen,
i
don’t
think
that
whether
arizona
states
that,
they
also
did
mention
the
incidental
purposes.
i
don’t
think
that
arizona’s
placing
its
emphasis
as
far
as
it
was
concerned
on
that
particular
element
or
alleged
public
purpose
in
anyway
should
govern
whether
or
not
this
statute
is
held
constitutional
or
unconstitutional
or
violative
or
un-violative
of
the
supremacy
clause.
the
reason
why
i
say
that
is,
this
is
the
--
challenged
portion
of
this
statute
is
all
but
verbatim,
the
statute
which
was
challenged
in
reitz
and
the
statute
which
was
challenged
in
kesler.
and
because
arizona
says
“of
the
various
purposes,
we
happen
to
think
this
one
is
the
more
valid”
is
no
reason
for
this
court
to
feel
that
we
are
talking
about
a
different
statute.
and
to
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
the
primary,
i
understand
correctly,
thank
you.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
i’m
suggesting
that
we
are
talking
about
the
same
statute.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
i
would
have
to
agree
with
that.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
i
don’t
feel
that
if
you
feel
the
statutes
are
substantially
the
same
for
the
purposes
of
judging
the
supremacy
argument,
that
arizona
is
classifying
one
as
primary
and
others
as
incidental
should
be
binding
upon
this
court.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
yes.
in
this
particular
--
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
may
i
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
the
schecter
case
as
i
recall,
the
particular
suspension
which
was
discussed
there
was
what
the
prejudgment
suspension.
the
suspension
which
is
prior
to
any
judgment
being
enlarged
where
a
determination
is
made
upon
the
reasonable
possibility
of
judgment
by
the
director
of
the
financial
responsibility
section
with
a
provision
for
appeal
from
his
determination,
wherein
he
also
sets
a
bond
and
the
instant
case
deals
with
a
post
judgment
suspension
where
the
liability
issues
and
so
forth
have
been
clear.
now
if
that
provides
a
distinction,
i’m
not
certain
other
than
that
the
bond
is
there,
i
would
tend
to
agree
with
this
court
concerning
the
primary
purpose
of
the
statute
concerned
as
opposed
to
the
arizona
court.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
that’s
--
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
that’s
my
understanding
of
the
decision,
excuse
me?
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
no
it’s
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
no,
it’s
the
third
person
victim.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
yes.
that
is
--
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
well
--
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
that
is
true.
but
--
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
however,
you’re
presupposing
facts
that
we’re
not
in
issue
in
the
schecter
case.
first
of
all,
there
was
no
discussion
of
whether
or
not
the
person
was
judgment
of
proof.
in
that
case,
they
were
imposing
a
bond.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
in
the
instant
case?
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
that’s
the
allegation
of
the
petitioner,
yes
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
well,
i
have
to
dispute
with
the
facts
that
if
you’re
basing
them
on
a
ninth
circuit
opinion
also
your
honor,
which
i
will
cover
in
the
emma
portion
of
my
oral
argument.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
well,
might
i
say
briefly
in
answer
to
that
and
i
doubt
that
it
will
satisfy
you.
i’m
not
so
sure
i’m
satisfied
with
the
arizona
explanation.
i
might
say
kesler
was
talking
about
a
prejudgment
situation
where
they
were
trying
to
extract
a
bond.
number
two,
it
may
not
be
every
situation
where
you
have
a
person
who
is
impecunious
or
indigent
who
is
the
person
subjected,
you
do
have
stubborn
people
who
maybe
refuse
to
get
insurance
and
refuse
to
maybe
protect
themselves
as
they
should,
but
who
are
not
necessarily
ones
who
are
indigent.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
that
is
a
rational
theory.
i’m
not
so
certain
of
the
wisdom
of
it.
i
might
point
out
that
congress
has
enacted
similar
legislation
for
the
district
of
columbia
as
well.
as
to
the
theory
which
you
propose
being
a
rational
theory,
i
would
definitely
agree
that,
that
is
probably
one
of
their
motives,
but
that
whether
or
not
it
is
effective
or
not,
is
subject
to
speculation.
now,
if
a
--
i
might
say
that
one
of
the
valid
purposes
which
has
been
mentioned,
but
never
discussed
in
any
full
degree
in
any
of
the
cases
i’ve
read
is
to
encourage
the
obtaining
of
insurance
or
the
posting
of
surety
bonds.
these
as
in
arizona
and
in
many
states
which
don’t
have
compulsory
insurance,
rental
agencies,
persons
who
contract
for
a
hire
and
so
forth,
are
often
required
to
do
and
treat
it
in
a
different
class
because
of
their
inordinate
and
use
of
highway
looking
toward
direct
pecuniary
gain.
i
might
say
that
a
complete
reversal
or
detraction
of
the
reverse
of
rights
kesler
position,
i
think
would
leave
us
in
a
position
to
where
as
a
practical
matter,
your
marginal
owner
would
be
maybe
financially
ahead
to
not
purchase
insurance
and
save
a
few
dollars
aside
to
pay
for
his
bankruptcy
discharge.
and
then
as
long
as
he’s
often
off
--
does
not
have
an
accident
for
another
six
years,
he’s
safe
again.
now,
i
would
like
to
direct
the
balance
of
my
comment
and
my
time,
i
believe
to,
with
the
exception
of
a
very
short
summary,
to
the
emma
perez
situation.
thus
far
we’ve
had
three
briefs
filed,
as
far
as
i’m
concerned,
and
an
opinion
written
by
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
that
is
entirely
in
error
concerning
law
and
facts,
concerning
emma
perez.
there
are
certain
aspects
and
basic
doctrines
of
community
property
law
and
tort
liability
law
in
arizona
that
best
be
explained.
the
first
one
is
that,
number
one,
in
arizona,
mere
ownership
of
a
vehicle
is
not
grounds
for
liability
against
the
owner
by
a
borrower,
negligently
driving
the
same.
secondly,
in
arizona
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
wife
to
be
a
party
to
a
judgment
versus
the
husband
for
driving
of
the
community
vehicle.
the
case
of
bristol
versus
moser
which
is
in
99
p.2nd
706,
in
the
case
of
first
national
bank
versus
reeves
which
is
on
234
pacific
556,
both
arizona
cases,
have
held
that
a
community,
let’s
assume
mr.
perez
is
on
a
community
errand.
i’ll
give
mr.
ching
that
much,
although
i
don’t
know
that
that
was
established
in
the
record
or
the
appendix.
mr.
perez
is
driving
a
community
vehicle
on
a
community
errand,
nevertheless,
pursuant
to
emma’s
contention,
she
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
accident
other
than
she
was
misfortunate
enough
to
be
married
to
an
uninsured,
non-negligent
community
property
husband
negligently
driving
her
community
--
the
community
property
vehicle.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
yes.
mrs.
perez
confessed
judgment,
if
she
is
to
be
believed
and
her
allegations
concerning
no
liability
at
all,
confessed
a
judgment
which
the
law
could
not
have
imposed
upon
her
had
she
chosen,
or
had
her
lawyer
advised
her
to
contest
it.
in
the
first
national
bank
versus
reeves
or
the
bristol
case
and
i
can’t
recall
which
one
of
them
says
“the
husband
is
the
only
indispensable
party
to
such
a
judgment.
the
other
one
vacated
a
judgment
versus
the
wife
and
husband
on
a
community
obligation.”
the
case
of
mortensen
v.
knight
in
arizona
deals
with
whether
or
not
parties
are
inversely
responsible
for
their
spouse's
negligent
operation
of
a
community
vehicle.
in
mortensen
v.
knight,
the
wife
was
the
negligent
driver,
the
husband
--
liability
was
imposed
against
the
husband,
on
a
theory
of
ownership,
no.
liability,
not
directly.
liability
was
imposed
against
the
husband
for
the
following
reason.
he
was
a
co-owner
because
it
was
community
vehicle,
yes,
but
the
court
said
“that
isn’t
enough.”
he
is
imposed
with
liability
because
arizona
makes
him
the
exclusive
agent
and
manager
of
the
community
that
was
a
community
vehicle.
he
had
a
right
to
control
his
wife.
conversely
as
pointed
out
in
all
these
briefs
filed
by
the
amicus
curiae
women’s
lib
groups,
conversely
by
that
very
own
arizona
opinion,
mrs.
perez
did
no
right
to
control
what
mr.
perez
did
because
she
has
no
right
to
control
the
utilization
of
community
property
contrary
to
her
husband’s
wishes,
and
consequently
could
not
have
been
held
liable.
the
law
imposes
a
suspension
versus
persons
who
are
not
owners
or
not
drivers
or
not
ones
who
maintain
vehicles.
the
suspension
is
imposed
against
persons
who
are
judgment
debtors
as
a
result
of
that
type
of
relationship
that
does
not
presuppose
that
someone
who
has
that
type
of
relationship
to
a
vehicle
is
going
to
be
a
judgment
debtor.
and
i
maintain
based
on
the
decisions
cited,
mortensen
v.
knight
incidentally
i’m
sorry
is
305
pacific
2nd
463,
and
peterson
v.
feldman
dealing
with
mere
ownership
is
not
sufficient
to
impose
liability
is
436
pacific
2nd
169,
once
again
both
arizona
cases.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
no
they’re
not
your
honor.
these
are
primarily
in
response
to
the
argument
which
is
set
out
in
the
amicus
curiae
brief
from
tucson.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
i
would
like
if
the
court
grant
leave
to
supplement
my
brief
either
by
just
giving
you
an
official
list
of
these
authorities
which
i
cite
in
my
opinion,
or
a
brief,
supplemental
answering
brief
in
response
to
the
amicus
curiae,
whichever
the
court
please.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
thank
you,
thank
you
i
appreciate
that.
so
basically,
my
contention
is
emma
perez
confessed
judgment
on
bad
advice
when
had
she
not
confessed
judgment,
she
could’ve
received
summary
judgment
if
she
could’ve
established
the
facts
which
she
asked
this
court
to
rely
on.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
i
regret
to
say
that
if
this
were
a
prejudgment
situation,
you
have
a
review.
the
post
judgment
suspension
relies
on
the
due
process
procedures
which
are
afforded
in
your
tortuous
action
tribunal.
consequently,
by
confessing
judgment
and
then
by
not
entering
an
appeal,
there
is
no
forum
now
and
it
is
--
the
judgment
is
a
judgment
to
that
extent.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
could
--
i’m
not
certain
i
followed
your
question
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
no.
arizona
--
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
i
don’t
believe
so
your
honor.
i
believe
that
arizona
would
certainly
feel
bound
by
the
kesler
decision
which
makes
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
i
would
have
to
say
my
answer
with
that
would
be
in
the
affirmative,
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
i
would
say
that
that
is
the
prevailing
practice.
however,
if
i
--
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
yes,
but
i
don’t
--
that
does
not
alter
what
is
the
law
in
arizona
and
there’s
one
other
factor
that
entertains
this
subject
when
you
sue
both
husband
and
wife
and
get
a
judgment
against
both
husband
and
wife.
if
you
have
a
negligent
husband
driving,
you
sue
him
and
you
sue
husband
and
--
excuse
me,
if
you
sue
him,
you
have
a
judgment
versus
the
community
if
he’s
on
a
community
errand,
and
you
have
a
judgment
versus
his
separate
property.
if
you
join
the
wife,
not
only
is
she
subjecting
her
community,
but
there’s
very
good
argument
even
if
they
want
to
characterize
it
“husband
and
wife”
after
their
judgment
heading
that
you’ve
also
got
her
separate
property
too,
for
something
that
should
not
in
anyway
be
affected
as
long
as
she
was
not
negligent,
did
not
have
any
power
to
control
the
operation
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
that’s
right
and
they
relied
on
bad
attorney’s
advice
in
the
lower
court,
the
same
advice
which
was
to
confess
judgment
and
go
through
bankruptcy.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
it
brings
us
to
a
situation,
i
believe
your
honor,
[attempt
to
laughter]
where
as
far
as
relief
for
mrs.
perez.
there’s
one
factor
which
is
later
on
in
my
notes,
but
i
might
mention
it
i
--
this
may
not
be
justice,
but
i
don’t
know
what
to
do,
what
the
law
can
do
about
people
who
confess
liability
to
actions
they’re
not
liable
for
and
then
let
their
appeal
time
run.
now,
this
is
a
sanction
which
they
relied
on.
they
relied
on
an
attorney
who
gave
them
advice
contrary
to
a
statute
which
at
least
at
the
time
of
his
advice
had
been
held
constitutional
or
like
counter
part
had.
i
don’t
know
what
to
--
what
advice
to
offer
them
other
than
the
fact
that
the
procedure
set
out
in
area
is
2011
65
had
never
been
utilized
in
this
case,
which
is
a
method
for
these
people
to
have
their
license
returned
and
i
would
call
the
court’s
attention
to
that.
arizona
is
unique,
i
think,
as
compared
to
the
other
states
who
have
this
because
in
reviewing,
some
of
the
other
states
who
have
statutes
based
on
the
uniform
safety
responsibility
act,
arizona
is
one
of
the
few
that
in
working
out
an
installment
plan
does
not
only
have
the
situation
where
you
can
have
concurrence
of
the
person
who
was
injured.
in
other
words,
you
can
have
your
license
returned
in
arizona
in
a
superior
court’s
discretion
by
petitioning
that
court,
filing
or
servicing
notice
on
the
injured
persons,
the
persons
who
would
have
a
right
to
object
or
be
the
real
party
in
interest,
actually.
and
you
can
go
into
that
court,
put
on
a
showing
as
to
your
ability
to
pay,
and
that
court
can
set
installment
payments.
i
would
surmise,
it
is
much
like
a
support
proceeding
for
fathers
who’ve
divorces
--
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
the
party
in
interest
pursuant
to
the
arizona
statutes,
and
i
would
be
less
than
candid
if
i
told
you
different,
were
still
be
victims
of
the
accident.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
bankruptcy
merely
precludes
those
people
from
utilizing
any
technical
aspects
in
collecting
that
judgment,
no
garnishments
or
executions.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
all
they
can
do
is
--
different
than
utah.
in
utah,
they
instigate
the
action.
in
arizona,
they
can
relieve
the
party
or
a
court
can
relieve
the
party
over
their
objection.
if
the
court
orders
them
to
pay
installment
payments
in
his
discretion
and
they
keep
up
their
installment
payments.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
i
believe
that’s
right.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
oh,
the
creditor
your
honor?
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
oh!
yes.
see,
i
was
a
little
confused
in
terminology.
he
doesn’t
have
the
right
to
keep
you
from
getting
it,
but
he
does.
we’re
playing
semantics
now
and
probably
i
am
with
you.
he
has
the
right
to
allow
you
off
the
hook
as
opposed
to
--
he
doesn’t
invoke
it.
i
might
be
playing
a
word
game
with
you,
i’m
afraid
possibly
i
am.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
i
might
point
out
to
the
court
that
we
have
--
mr.
ching
has
admitted
that
you
can
require
compulsory
insurance.
he’s
also
--
i
would
feel
by
this
same
admission,his
objection
is
to
the
creditor,
the
creditor’s
power
in
this
situation.
what
if
we
had
a
statute
in
arizona
which
said
you
get
in
an
accident
and
you
don’t
show
us
that
you
had
insurance
or
some
other
funds,
deposit
on
that
date
of
that
accident,
you
loose
your
license
automatically;
nothing
about
creditors,
nothing
about
bankruptcy,
or
anything
else.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
that’s
true.
the
creditor
does
have
power
to
relieve,
also
the
superior
court
does
your
honor,
based
on
conditional
payments
which
either
the
creditor
could
waive
if
he’d
wanted
to.
we
can
expect,
it’s
impractical,
but
they
could
relieve
on
an
installment
plan.
this
is
--
we
talk
about
whether
customarily
used.
they
also
have
the
power
where
you
have
a
creditor
who
is
over
bearing.
the
superior
court
does
have
the
power
under
the
areas
of
2011
65
section,
to
set
monthly
payments
in
his
discretion.
i
merely
point
out
to
the
court
the
admissions,
concerning
insurance
as
a
compulsory,
prerequisite
and
so
forth.
and
once
again,
i
still
have
to
admit
that
i
am
somewhat
baffled
as
our
respondents
who
i
represent,
how
a
person
can
admit
that
this
could
be
required
as
a
precondition
to
issuance
of
the
license,
yet
a
less
severe
restriction
is
unconstitutional.
now
--
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
that’s
true,
that’s
true.
i’m
referring
to
characterization
and
our
argument
--
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
yes.
i
might
point
out
on
the
brief
from
the
woman
center
in
los
angeles,
one
of
the
amicus
curiae
briefs.
in
brief
response
to
that,
once
again
they
are
relying
on
the
fact
which
was
pointed
in
ninth
circuit
erroneously
that
emma
perez
is
an
established
fact
was
non-negligent.
only
mr.
ching’s
assertion
concerning
the
complaint
that
we
know
that
she’s
not
negligent.
not
being
in
the
car
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
you’re
guilty
of
nonfeasance
or
in
fact
misfeasance.
there
are
innumerable
factual
situations
where
this
could’ve
been
imposed.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
i
would
think
so.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
i
would
think
so.
i
would
--
that
what
would
be
my
position
right
or
wrong
as
to
these
facts.
secondly,
the
court
of
appeals
did
rely
on
a
case
by
the
name
of
donato
versus
fishburn
to
say
the
wife
is
bound
to
join
in
this
judgment.
gentlemen,
i
have
reread
donato
versus
fishburn.
i
don’t
know
where
the
court
of
appeals
came
to
that
conclusion,
it
certainly
not
in
the
case.
all
it
talks
about
is
executing
versus
the
community
based
on
a
judgment.
there’s
no
discussion
in
there
whatsoever
concerning
whether
or
not
a
wife
has
to
be
or
does
not
have
to
be,
any
discussion
concerning
proper,
necessary
indispensable
parties
in
a
community
property
situation.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
yes,
if
you’re
taking
about
the
supremacy
clause,
definitely.
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
we
do
have
--
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
yes,
but
we
do
have
other
contentions
in
the
various
other
briefs
and
we
also
have
some
erroneous
conclusions
in
the
ninth
circuit
brief
which
i
did
want
to
make
sure
the
court
was
clarified
as
to
my
position.
yes,
i
would
agree.
i
personally
think,
for
instance
mr.
ching
mentioned
that
he’s
going
--
first
his
brief
talks
about
perez’s
and
then
he
says
“in
addition,
here
is
emma”,
and
then
he
says
“emma’s
innocent.”
therefore,
i
personally
think
innocent,
not
innocent,
owner,
driver,
what
have
you
if
it
violates
the
supremacy
clause
because
the
suspension
isn’t
discharged,
it
doesn’t
make
any
difference.
if
she’s
innocent
or
if
she
was
guilty
of
all
the
gross
negligence
because
of
course,
that
can’t
be
discharged
--
mr.
robert
h.
schlosser
--
well
for
moment,
excuse
me,
but
the
distinction
in
relationship,
i
don’t
think
has
any
validity
if
the
supremacy
what
we’re
talking
about.
my
time
is
up.
i
want
to
thank
you
for
your
time.
