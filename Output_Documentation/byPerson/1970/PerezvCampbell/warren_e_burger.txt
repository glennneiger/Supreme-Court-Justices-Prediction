chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
perez
against
campbell
for
the
state
of
arizona.
mr.
ching
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
speak
of
it
is
being
a
confession
of
judgment,
do
you
mean
the
conventional
default
judgment
where
they
did
not
respond
or
did
they
affirmatively
confess?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
the
judgment
have
been
entered
against
the
driver
only?
is
there
any
impediment
in
arizona
law
to
doing
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
once
having
been
brought
against
both
of
them,
could
a
lawful
judgment
have
been
entered
against
the
driver
only,
the
husband?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
the
plaintiff
and
the
defendants
had
agreed
upon
that,
it
probably
could’ve
been
done,
isn’t
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
when
you
use
the
word
responsible,
referring
to
it,
i
assume
in
the
statute,
in
what
sense
do
you
think
that
word
is
used?
responsible
meaning
a
careful
driver
or
is
it
responsible
in
the
sense
of
a
driver
who
can
respond
and
does
respond
in
damages?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
don’t
you
suppose
that
arizona
legislature
had
in
mind
that
if
there
was
a
criminal
conviction,
manslaughter
for
example,
that
their
invariably
or
if
not
then
almost
invariably,
there
would
be
a
judgment
or
a
claim
that
would
be
satisfied
or
else
would
come
under
the
civil
provisions
of
the
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
thought
you
had
just
agreed
in
response
to
a
question
of
justice
blackmun
that
the
state
had
a
lawful
power
under
its
police
power
to
require
insurance,
did
i
misunderstand
you
on
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
is
that
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
independent
of
the
bankruptcy
discharge,
do
you
think
you
have
no
claim
by
reason
of
the
state
of
arizona
canceling
her
license
for
conduct
in
which
she
had
no
direct
involvement?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
i
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
go
back
to
justice
blackmun’s
question.
are
you
abandoning
any
claim
that
apart
from
the
bankruptcy
problem,
arizona
cannot
constitutionally
do
this
to
her,
to
the
wife?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
ching.
mr.
schlosser?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
by
the
way,
mr.
ching
i
think
you
have
probably
five
minutes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh!
you
have
--
we’ll
make
that
a
minute
mr.
ching.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
schlosser.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
i’m
confused
too,
as
justice
stewart
is.
i
thought
someone
had
been
referring
to
the
victims
of
uncompensated
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
accidents
through
the
people
who
are
on
welfare
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
not
the
driver
of
the
car.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you’re
not
concerned
about
him.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
the
arizona
legislature
is
dealing
with
the
generality
of
people,
not
those
who
will
be
judgment
proof,
and
that
they
believe
at
least
that
this
kind
of
a
statute
holding
the
club
of
cancellation
of
the
license
will
lead
in
most
cases
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
judgment.
isn’t
that
a
rational
theory,
or
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you’re
going
to
give
us
that
though.
you’re
going
to
supplement
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may
just
submit
the
list,
if
that
suits
your
purpose.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
creditor
is
not
taking
any
action
here,
it’s
only
state
action
we’re
concerned
with,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
say
that
they’re
foreclosed,
everyone’s
foreclosed
in
challenging
that
by
reason
of
the
entry
of
a
judgment
by
confession
whether
it
was
good
or
bad
advice?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
can’t
go
behind
the
judgment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
schlosser.
we’ll
give
you
a
little
more
time
mr.
ching.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
can
you
categorize
that
mr.
ching?
it
depends
on
the
economic
status
of
the
particular
victim?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
really
can’t
generalize
about
people
who
get
hit
by
automobiles,
can
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
ching.
thank
you
mr.
