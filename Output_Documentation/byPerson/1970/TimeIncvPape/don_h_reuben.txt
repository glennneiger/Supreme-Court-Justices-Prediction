mr.
don
h.
reuben
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
don
h.
reuben
--
may
it
please
the
court.
this
suit
for
libel
had
its
inception
in
a
raid
led
by
the
respondent
on
the
westside
apartment
of
a
black
family
in
the
city
of
chicago
in
the
year
1958.
the
family's
name
was
monroe
and
at
that
time
the
respondent
was
the
deputy
chief
of
detectives
of
the
city
of
chicago.
shortly
after
the
raid,
the
monroe
family
brought
an
action
in
the
federal
district
court
of
chicago,
alleging
that
the
raiding
party
and
specifically
that
the
respondent,
captain
pape
broke
the
doors
down,
woke
the
monroe
couple
with
flashlights,
forced
them
at
gunpoint
to
leave
their
bed
and
stand
naked
in
the
center
of
the
living
room,
roused
the
six
children
that
were
in
the
apartment
at
that
time,
herded
them
into
the
living
room.
that
the
respondent
struck
mr.
monroe
several
times
with
his
flashlight,
calling
him
nigger
and
black
boy.
that
another
officer
pushed
mrs.
monroe.
that
the
children
were
hit
and
kicked
and
that
the
police
ransacked
every
room,
throwing
clothing
from
closets
to
the
floor,
dumping
drawers
and
ripping
mattress
covers
and
the
like.
the
cause
ultimately
reached
this
court
and
this
court
held
in
1961
in
monroe
versus
pape
that
a
cause
of
action
was
stated
on
behalf
of
monroe
and
against
captain
pape.
then
in
november
of
1961,
the
civil
rights
commission
issued
it's
fifth
report
which
it
had
entitled
“justice.”
pertinent
excerpts
of
justice
appear
in
appendix
323.
chapter
2
of
“justice”
deals
with
police
violence
and
is
headed
“unlawful
police
violence.”
the
commission
says,
in
chapter
2,
that
the
allegations
of
misconduct
are
supported
in
several
cases
by
criminal
convictions
or
findings
by
impartial
agencies,
in
others
by
sworn
testimony,
affidavit
from
an
eye
witness,
or
by
staff
field
investigations.
in
no
case,
as
the
commission
determined
conclusively,
whether
the
complaints
of
the
officers
were
correct
in
their
statements.
this
is
the
function
of
a
court.
the
commission
said
“it
was
of
the
opinion
that
the
allegations
appeared
substantial
enough
to
justify
discussion
in
this
study.”
there
was
a
heading
“patterns
of
police
brutalities,”
a
sub
heading
“enforcement
of
segregation
or
subordinate
status,”
punishment;
third,
the
third
degree
in
coercion
of
confessions
and
the
forth
section
was
initial
contact
and
arrest
and
under
the
heading
“search,
seizure
and
violence:
chicago
1958,”
the
commission
discussed
the
case
or
the
actions
of
captain
pape.
the
commission
did
so
by
using
the
language
of
the
dissent
of
justice
frankfurter
in
monroe
versus
pape
and
the
commission's
lead
was
to
say,
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
state's
decided
the
case
of
monroe
versus
pape
on
february
20,
1961.
although
this
decision
did
not
finally
dispose
of
the
case,
it
did
permit
the
plaintiff
to
sue
several
chicago
police
officers
for
violation
of
the
federal
civil
rights
act
on
the
basis
of
a
compliant
which
alleged
that
and
then
justice
frankfurter's
opinion
was
quoted.
time
incorporated,
upon
receiving
the
commission
report,
wrote
an
article
and
published
it
in
the
ensuing
edition
of
time.
that
article
appears
in
hike
verb
(ph)
in
our
brief
at
page
8,
it's
called
“civil
rights.”
the
respondent
sued
for
libel.
the
case
was
decided
by
the
district
judge
on
motion
prior
to
this
court's
decision
in
new
york
times.
the
district
judge
dismissed
the
cause.
the
court
of
appeals,
with
one
judge
dissenting,
reversed.
thereafter
when
the
case
was
remanded,
the
plaintiff's
position
--
captain
pape's
position
was
taken,
the
court's
decision
in
new
york
times
had
come
down.
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
was
made.
it
was
granted
on
the
basis
of
new
york
times.
the
case
went
back
to
the
court
of
appeals,
was
again
reversed.
the
third
time
when
the
case
was
remanded,
the
district
court
empaneled
a
jury
and
a
full
hearing
was
had
and
the
pertinent
evidence
to
this
cause
shows
that
the
author
or
the
man
that
originally
wrote
the
story,
dropped
the
word
“alleged”
or
did
not
indicate
in
his
reporting
of
the
event
that
this
material
that
came
from
the
civil
rights
commission
report
was
in
turn
a
statement
of
justice
frankfurter's
statement
of
the
complaint.
he
was
asked
specifically
and
it
is
at
page
12
of
our
brief
and
it's
appendix
208
and
209,
why
he
dropped
the
word
“alleged”
and
he
said,
the
word
“alleged”
cannot
be
taken
just
in
that
context.
it
has
to
be
taken
in
the
context
of
the
entire
chapter.
he
says
“it
means
to
me
that
the
commission
in
this
case
is
reporting
this
instance
in
terms
of
a
claim
being
made
in
a
court
by
the
monroes,
but
you
can't
stop
there.
in
the
context
of
the
entire
chapter,
it
is
not
a
simple
allegation
because
the
commission
has
also
said
that
we
will
not
include
just
an
allegation
that
we
have
not
verified
in
some
fashion.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
well,
i
think
captain
pape
would
call
it
“deliberate,”
i
call
it
“conscious”
omission.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
yes,
absolutely.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
absolutely.
after
--
mr.
don
h.
reuben
yes,
he
did,
mr.
justice
stewart.
he
obtained
a
verdict
and
judgment
which
was
paid
and
was
not
appealed.
however,
in
candor
the
author
of
time
incorporated
didn't
know
it
at
the
time
because
it
hadn't
happened
yet,
but
it
has
happened
while
this
libel
suit
was
pending.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
yes
sir
and
that
was
called
to
seventh
circuit's
attention
and
they
said
that
it
was
of
not
any
relevance
in
this
cause.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
i
certainly
do.
i
think
it
would
be
a
travesty
to
say
that
the
respondent
here
has
a
right
to
sue
for
libel
when
he
has
been
found
guilty
of
the
ultimate
sting
of
the
article
of
violating
monroe's
civil
rights.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
we
used
the
term
guilty
in
the
suit
[attempt
to
laughter]
of
course
in
chicago.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
well,
i
suspect
that,
that
was
something
that
captain
pape
would
have
addressed
to
the
court
in
the
monroe
versus
pape.
these
were
taken
on
appeal,
if
he
had
thought
that,
that
was
truly
the
result.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
well,
i
suggest
to
you
that
the
courts
looked
to
the
sting
of
the
article
and
sting
of
the
article
was
it
violated
the
civil
rights
of
the
monroes
which
is
the
sting
of
the
burden.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
as
i
understand
the
law
of
libel,
a
substantial
truth
is
allowed
and
if
the
gist
of
the
libel
is
a
violation
of
the
civil
rights
of
monroe
--
mr.
don
h.
reuben
this
is
what
--
mr.
don
h.
reuben
--
court
of
appeals.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
the
case
never
went
to
the
jury.
the
district
judge
took
the
case
from
the
jury
and
dismissed
it.
the
court
of
appeals
dismissed
it.
the
article
after
--
mr.
don
h.
reuben
that's
correct.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
that's
correct.
now
i
want
to
go
on
to
the
editorial
process
because
it
didn't
just
stop
with
the
article
being
written
by
mr.
magnuson.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
i
do
not
concede
it,
but
the
district
judge
assumed
it
for
the
purpose
of
deciding
the
motion
at
the
close
of
all
the
evidence.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
my
position
is
i
do
not
concede
that
it
is
false.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
that
is
correct,
but
i
don't
think
that's
before
court.
i
just
--
at
this
moment
the
case
--
mr.
don
h.
reuben
i
think
you
have
to,
i
have
to
be
candid.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
after
the
--
mr.
don
h.
reuben
because
the
district
judge
did
not
--
no
trier
of
fact
has
decided
that.
the
trier
of
fact,
the
district
--
mr.
don
h.
reuben
that's
why
you
have
to
assume
it's
false
and
the
question
is
actual
malice,
that's
the
issue
that
the
district
judge
went
off
on
here.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
that's
correct.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
that's
correct.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
no
i
do
not.
i
do
not
and
the
author
i
think
made
it
very
clear
that
as
he
read
the
entire
civil
rights
commission
report,
it
was
not
an
inaccurate
report.
it
would
be
civil
rights
commission
and
that's
the
thrust
of
his
testimony.
the
civil
rights
commission
was
not
merely
reporting
mr.
monroe's
allegations
in
the
complaint.
the
civil
rights
commission
by
it's
opening
statement,
by
it's
headlines,
by
the
mere
inclusion
of
the
pape
case
was
making
a,
if
you
will,
an
independent
finding
that
this
was
a
case
of
substance
that
merited
a
discussion
and
this
was
precisely
the
view
of
the
dissenting
judge
in
the
first
opinion,
pre-new
york
times
when
the
case
was
decided
on
state
law.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
no
sir,
the
case
is
over.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
nothing
went
to
the
jury.
the
district
--
mr.
don
h.
reuben
because
the
district
judge
dismissed
the
case
at
the
close
of
the
evidence.
if
you
--
mr.
don
h.
reuben
if
you
reverse
the
case
is
over,
if
you
affirm,
the
case
goes
back
to
the
jury.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
i'm
sorry
i
misunderstood
you.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
yes.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
well,
i
think
that
the
best
answer
to
that
is
to
review
what
time
did
here.
mr.
magnuson
whose
testimony
i
read,
the
court
indicated
that
he
thought
from
a
reading
of
the
civil
rights
commission
report
as
a
whole
that
this
was
as
he
said
“there's
more
an
allegation
of
a
complaint
being
reported
here.”
additionally
after
the
article
was
written
and
i
think
the
court
has
to
look
at
this
article
as
though
it
was
uttered
by
time
incorporated,
you
have
to
look
at
the
whole
editorial
process.
the
article
was
sent
to
a
research
department
and
the
morgue
on
captain
pape
or
the
reference
file
which
they
had
was
taken
by
an
independent
researcher
and
there
was
discovered
a
number
of
material
on
monroe
versus
pape,
including
a
new
york
post
article
which
is
in
the
record
and
including
a
time
zone
in-house
dispatches
which
indicated
that
the
incidents
reported
by
the
civil
rights
commission
in
the
words
of
justice
frankfurter
were
true
and
the
combination
of
the
researcher's
independent
judgment
plus
the
editor's
judgment
plus
the
writer's
judgment
resulted
in
an
editorial
decision,
in
an
editorial
decision
to
publish
this
material
in
the
form
that's
before
the
court.
and
in
the
new
york
times
case
and
in
the
st.
amant
case,
the
test
is
of
actual
malice
is
whether
there
was
a
publication
made
by
one
who
published
knowing
it
was
false
and
intending
to
do
harm
through
falsehood
or
as
justice
white
said
in
st.
amant,
“a
high
degree
of
awareness
of
falsity
and
nevertheless
publishing,
intending
to
do
harm
by
publishing
falsehood.”
there
is
not
one
thing
in
this
record
that
indicates
that
this
author
or
this
researcher
or
time
incorporated
had
any
knowledge
of
falsity
or
had
any
awareness
of
falsity.
rather
what
we
believe
and
what
the
district
judge
held
and
what
two
judges
or
at
least
the
first
dissenting
circuit
court
judge
held
was
that
a
fair
reading
of
the
civil
rights
material
alone
could
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
the
report
about
pape
in
the
civil
rights
commission
was
true.
and
i
suggest
if
you
read
the
dissent
in
the
first
pape
case,
decided
pre-new
york
times
and
you
see
there
a
court
of
appeals
judge,
looking
at
the
four
corners
of
justice
and
saying
to
--
in
his
dissent
that
a
reasonable
person
could
read
“justice”
and
conclude
that
times
report
was
an
accurate
report
of
justice.
that
if
an
independent
judgment
like
that
can
be
made,
then
it's
passing
strange
to
say
that
the
author
had
either
knowledge
of
falsity
in
reading
“justice”
when
--
or
had
a
high
degree
of
awareness
of
falsity.
now,
the
seventh
circuit
which
reversed
judge
robson's
holding
that
to
allow
this
case
to
go
to
the
jury
would
have
a
chilling
effect
on
the
first
amendment,
singled
out,
singled
out
the
word
“alleged”
or
the
dropping
of
the
word
“alleged”
and
on
that
basis,
and
on
that
basis
alone
held
that
the
case
had
to
go
to
the
jury
on
the
issue
of
actual
malice.
it
was
that
single
facet
that
prompted
every
reversal
and
what
you
see,
i
submit
to
your
honors,
is
an
ability
by
any
court
in
the
country
to
give
lip
service
to
your
honor's
decisions
in
new
york
times
and
its
progeny
st.
amant
and
the
cases
in
between
and
nevertheless
within
the
framework
of
giving
all
of
the
pi's
(ph)
utterances
possible
to
new
york
times
to
hold
that
a
libel
occurred
or
that
actual
malice
occurred
by
singling
out
one
factor
and
what
--
there
are
at
least
three
vices
in
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
and
what
occurred
here.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
no.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
it
might
i
say
not
in
this
case.
in
this
case
i
think
it
cannot
--
mr.
don
h.
reuben
that's
correct
because
of
the
contents
of
“justice.”
i
think
--
when
the
first
case
was
decided,
of
the
four
judges
that
heard
it,
one
district
court
and
court
of
appeals
judge,
they
held
that
under
the
state
law
pre-new
york
times
that
it
was
not
libel,
that
it
was
a
fair
report
of
“justice”
within
the
four
corners.
now
i'm
not
sure
that
that
rises
to
the
dignity.
i
have
to
--
or
the
first
amendment
right,
but
it
was
an
incorrect
decision
in
my
judgment
and
it
is
not
libelous.
i
think
that
that
time
incorporated
article
was
a
fair
report
of
“justice.”
mr.
don
h.
reuben
although
it
would
be
in
my
judgment
wrong
because
the
mere
act
of
putting
it
in
to
the
a
section
on
police
brutality
and
using
those
incidents,
selecting
incidents
all
over
the
country
and
using
those
incidents
as
a
basis
for
recommendations
to
the
congress
concerning
how
remedial
legislation
should
be
enacted,
takes
it
out
of
the
category
of
just
the
mere
allegation
of
a
complaint.
there
is
a
--
mr.
don
h.
reuben
that
is
the
issue
that
i
think,
has
come
before
the
court
the
way
the
case
was
pitched,
that's
correct.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
you
have
to,
yes
sir.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
yes
sir,
you
have
to
do
that
absolutely.
and
it
is
our
position,
if
you
will,
that
the
record
shows
that
based
upon
all
of
the
facts
of
the
contents
of
justice
and
the
more
it
clips
which
suggests
to
any
reasonable
person
that
this
is
true,
that
it
is
incorrect
for
the
court
of
appeals
to,
if
you
will,
second
guess
the
editorial
process
and
the
editorial
decision
of
time
and
to
say,
that
use
or
no
use
of
language
is
tantamount
to
uttering
deliberate
falsehood
or
is
tantamount
to
uttering
--
well
the
court
of
appeal
didn't
even
suggest
it
was
high
degree
of
awareness,
they
pitched
it
solely
under
the
grounds
of
deliberate
falsehood.
furthermore,
i
suggest
the
court
of
appeals
only
went
one
step
and
said,
well,
in
their
view
you
misstated
a
report
of
government,
but
if
time
incorporated
believed
that
the
ultimate
facts
were
true,
then
there
can
no
malice
under
the
test
of
new
york
times
and
the
record
shows
here.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
well,
i'm
suggesting
to
you
that
in
some
respects
they
did
make
their
own
investigation
by
going
to
the
--
mr.
don
h.
reuben
no,
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
and
i'm
suggesting
to
the
court
that
whether
the
civil
rights
commission
--
whether
times
states
it
on
his
own
authority
or
on
the
civil
rights
commission's
authority,
if
time
incorporated
believed
the
ultimate
fact
to
be
true,
that
the
test
for
actual
malice
is
not
satisfied.
that
if
time
incorporate
believes
the
ultimate
fact
to
be
true,
whether
it
says
that
our
nearest
authority
or
the
civil
rights
commission
--
mr.
don
h.
reuben
he
did
it.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
i
think,
you've
come
to
the
heart
of
the
matter,
i
don't
think
that
the
fact
that
he
misread
or
was
wrong
in
misreading
the
civil
rights
commission
is
enough.
i
think,
you
have
to
have
him
deliberately
intending
to
falsify
what
the
civil
rights
commission
said.
it
is
not
error,
but
it's
an
intension
to
cause
harm
through
the
uttering
of
falsehood
and
that's
not
in
this
record.
and
i
suggest
to
you
that
the
analysis
made
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
reach
that
very
result
was
a
myopic
analysis.
and
it
was
made
by
singling
out
that
fact,
not
looking
at
the
author's
testimony,
not
looking
at
the
district
court's
findings,
not
looking
at
the
clips
or
the
morgue
and
looking
at
the
full
contents
of
justice.
and
just
as
this
court
has
held
that
the
failure
to
investigate
and
that
was
in
the
new
york
times,
does
not
with
convincing
clarity,
and
that's
the
test
as
i
read
the
case,
turn
this
into
actual
malice.
so
the
mere
misreading,
the
mere
error
in
stating
the
report
is
not
actual
malice
as
this
court
has
annunciated
actual
malice.
i
would
like
to
save
five
minutes
for
reply.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
i
do
not
consider
it
irrelevant.
i
consider
it
highly
pertinent
and
indisputable
that
he
is
a
public
official,
he
was
the
–-
mr.
don
h.
reuben
i
would
think
so
but
i
don't
think
you
have
to
reach
it
here.
the
record
shows,
he
was
the
deputy
chief
of
the
detectives,
he
had
chauffeur,
he
had
people
under
him,
he
had
office,
he
had
all
the
trappings
and
when
he
was
on
duty,
he
was
the
chief
of
detective,
because
i
think
he
had
the
night
shift
and
the
day
shift
was
the
chief
of
detectives.
i
think
if
ever
there
was
a
public
official
going
back
to
rosenblum,
captain
pape
is
a
public
official.
mr.
dunne
–-
mr.
don
h.
reuben
mr.
dunne
argues
malice
from
the
tone
of
the
article.
as
i
read
the
cases
of
this
court,
the
issue
is
what
was
the
editorial
process,
what
was
done
by
those
who
prepared
and
authored
the
material
not
what
was
the
final
work
product
and
it's
an
objective,
subjective,
inquiry,
if
you
will.
i
read
in
my
opening
statement,
the
testimony
of
mr.
magnuson
of
what
he
believed,
i
think
also
highly
pertinent
is
the
testimony
which
appears
at
appendix
224
of
the
researcher
who
had
the
article
and
had
the
(inaudible)
and
who
said
the
writer
had
chosen
in
conjunction
with
the
editor
which
material
they
were
going
to
use
out
of
this
particular
quotation
and
checking
back
with
my
own
editorial
reference
files,
i
believe
that
what
we
printed
was
an
accurate
representation
and
we're
not
taking
anything
out
of
context.
i
think
what
the
court
of
appeals
and
mr.
dunne
has
done
is
confused
consciousness
of
the
act,
consciousness
of
what
they
wrote
and
consciousness
of
what
they
did.
with
knowledge
of
falsity,
the
two
are
miles
apart.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
knowledge
of
falsity
of
the
ultimate
facts.
the
ultimate
facts
–-
mr.
don
h.
reuben
he
believed
--
in
his
testimony
as
he
believed
that
in
the
context
of
justice
that
the
word
alleged
were
simply
a
device,
an
editorial
device
of
the
civil
rights
commission
to
introduce
or
discuss
the
pape
case
in
the
language
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
which
the
commission
was
apparently
smitten
with
or
at
least
thought
was
an
accurate
–-
mr.
don
h.
reuben
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
don't
think
there
was
an
imperative
need
but
i
suggest
to
you
that
if
the
case
is
going
to
go
off
on
whether
there
was
an
imperative
need,
then
you
truly
have
a
chilling
effect
on
pruning
it
if
a
court
can
come
back
after
some
years,
in
this
case
ten
years
after
the
fact
and
say,
well,
there's
a
better
way
to
say
this.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
i
suggest
to
you
that
the
chilling
effect
is
to
say
the
time
magazine
that
although
you
honestly
thought
this
was
true,
you
should
have
stated
it
a
different
way
and
because
you
didn't
state
it
a
different
way,
because
we
disagree
what
your
editorial
judgment
that
you
are
guilty
of
actual
malice,
you
are
guilty
of
knowledge
of
falsity.
you
may
disagree
with
their
penmanship,
you
may
disagree
with
their
choice
of
words,
but
i
say
that
as
--
under
the
cases
of
this
court
unless
the
record
shows
with
the
convincing
clarity
that
those
choice
of
words
reflect
knowledge
of
falsity
and
an
intension
to
do
a
malicious
harm
by
publishing
that
falsity
that
there
is
no
actual
malice.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
i
say
there
is
no
liability,
there's
nothing
submissible
to
the
jury
because
–-
mr.
don
h.
reuben
within
the
context
of
what
it
believes
to
be
true,
within
the
context
of
what
–-
of
course
that
isn't
this
case,
but
within
the
context
of
what
it
believes
to
be
true,
it
can't
go
on
and
say,
captain
pape,
according
to
the
civil
rights
commission
did
many
other
incidents.
but
if
it's
tied
in
--
if
it
believes
the
ultimate
facts
are
true
and
there
was
a
deliberate
attempt
here
to
misstate
the
commission's
report
which
i
deny.
i
say
there
is
no
liability.
there
is
nothing
to
go
to
the
jury,
there
is
no
actual
malice.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
no,
i
don't
think
it
is
in
this
case,
absolutely
not.
i
think
in
this
case
--
i
don't
even
concede
it
was
false.
i
think
in
this
case
that
the
first
district
court
decision
and
the
first
dissent
was
correct
and
this
under
common
law
prior
to
new
york
times
was
a
fair
report
of
a
governmental
utterance
and
i
say
that
when
two
judges
say
so,
it
is
passing
strange
to
say
that
when
an
author
so
believes
he
is
guilty
of
publishing
knowing
falsity.
thank
you.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
don
h.
reuben
--
may
it
please
the
court.
this
suit
for
libel
had
its
inception
in
a
raid
led
by
the
respondent
on
the
westside
apartment
of
a
black
family
in
the
city
of
chicago
in
the
year
1958.
the
family's
name
was
monroe
and
at
that
time
the
respondent
was
the
deputy
chief
of
detectives
of
the
city
of
chicago.
shortly
after
the
raid,
the
monroe
family
brought
an
action
in
the
federal
district
court
of
chicago,
alleging
that
the
raiding
party
and
specifically
that
the
respondent,
captain
pape
broke
the
doors
down,
woke
the
monroe
couple
with
flashlights,
forced
them
at
gunpoint
to
leave
their
bed
and
stand
naked
in
the
center
of
the
living
room,
roused
the
six
children
that
were
in
the
apartment
at
that
time,
herded
them
into
the
living
room.
that
the
respondent
struck
mr.
monroe
several
times
with
his
flashlight,
calling
him
nigger
and
black
boy.
that
another
officer
pushed
mrs.
monroe.
that
the
children
were
hit
and
kicked
and
that
the
police
ransacked
every
room,
throwing
clothing
from
closets
to
the
floor,
dumping
drawers
and
ripping
mattress
covers
and
the
like.
the
cause
ultimately
reached
this
court
and
this
court
held
in
1961
in
monroe
versus
pape
that
a
cause
of
action
was
stated
on
behalf
of
monroe
and
against
captain
pape.
then
in
november
of
1961,
the
civil
rights
commission
issued
it's
fifth
report
which
it
had
entitled
“justice.”
pertinent
excerpts
of
justice
appear
in
appendix
323.
chapter
2
of
“justice”
deals
with
police
violence
and
is
headed
“unlawful
police
violence.”
the
commission
says,
in
chapter
2,
that
the
allegations
of
misconduct
are
supported
in
several
cases
by
criminal
convictions
or
findings
by
impartial
agencies,
in
others
by
sworn
testimony,
affidavit
from
an
eye
witness,
or
by
staff
field
investigations.
in
no
case,
as
the
commission
determined
conclusively,
whether
the
complaints
of
the
officers
were
correct
in
their
statements.
this
is
the
function
of
a
court.
the
commission
said
“it
was
of
the
opinion
that
the
allegations
appeared
substantial
enough
to
justify
discussion
in
this
study.”
there
was
a
heading
“patterns
of
police
brutalities,”
a
sub
heading
“enforcement
of
segregation
or
subordinate
status,”
punishment;
third,
the
third
degree
in
coercion
of
confessions
and
the
forth
section
was
initial
contact
and
arrest
and
under
the
heading
“search,
seizure
and
violence:
chicago
1958,”
the
commission
discussed
the
case
or
the
actions
of
captain
pape.
the
commission
did
so
by
using
the
language
of
the
dissent
of
justice
frankfurter
in
monroe
versus
pape
and
the
commission's
lead
was
to
say,
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
state's
decided
the
case
of
monroe
versus
pape
on
february
20,
1961.
although
this
decision
did
not
finally
dispose
of
the
case,
it
did
permit
the
plaintiff
to
sue
several
chicago
police
officers
for
violation
of
the
federal
civil
rights
act
on
the
basis
of
a
compliant
which
alleged
that
and
then
justice
frankfurter's
opinion
was
quoted.
time
incorporated,
upon
receiving
the
commission
report,
wrote
an
article
and
published
it
in
the
ensuing
edition
of
time.
that
article
appears
in
hike
verb
(ph)
in
our
brief
at
page
8,
it's
called
“civil
rights.”
the
respondent
sued
for
libel.
the
case
was
decided
by
the
district
judge
on
motion
prior
to
this
court's
decision
in
new
york
times.
the
district
judge
dismissed
the
cause.
the
court
of
appeals,
with
one
judge
dissenting,
reversed.
thereafter
when
the
case
was
remanded,
the
plaintiff's
position
--
captain
pape's
position
was
taken,
the
court's
decision
in
new
york
times
had
come
down.
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
was
made.
it
was
granted
on
the
basis
of
new
york
times.
the
case
went
back
to
the
court
of
appeals,
was
again
reversed.
the
third
time
when
the
case
was
remanded,
the
district
court
empaneled
a
jury
and
a
full
hearing
was
had
and
the
pertinent
evidence
to
this
cause
shows
that
the
author
or
the
man
that
originally
wrote
the
story,
dropped
the
word
“alleged”
or
did
not
indicate
in
his
reporting
of
the
event
that
this
material
that
came
from
the
civil
rights
commission
report
was
in
turn
a
statement
of
justice
frankfurter's
statement
of
the
complaint.
he
was
asked
specifically
and
it
is
at
page
12
of
our
brief
and
it's
appendix
208
and
209,
why
he
dropped
the
word
“alleged”
and
he
said,
the
word
“alleged”
cannot
be
taken
just
in
that
context.
it
has
to
be
taken
in
the
context
of
the
entire
chapter.
he
says
“it
means
to
me
that
the
commission
in
this
case
is
reporting
this
instance
in
terms
of
a
claim
being
made
in
a
court
by
the
monroes,
but
you
can't
stop
there.
in
the
context
of
the
entire
chapter,
it
is
not
a
simple
allegation
because
the
commission
has
also
said
that
we
will
not
include
just
an
allegation
that
we
have
not
verified
in
some
fashion.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
well,
i
think
captain
pape
would
call
it
“deliberate,”
i
call
it
“conscious”
omission.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
yes,
absolutely.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
absolutely.
after
--
mr.
don
h.
reuben
yes,
he
did,
mr.
justice
stewart.
he
obtained
a
verdict
and
judgment
which
was
paid
and
was
not
appealed.
however,
in
candor
the
author
of
time
incorporated
didn't
know
it
at
the
time
because
it
hadn't
happened
yet,
but
it
has
happened
while
this
libel
suit
was
pending.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
yes
sir
and
that
was
called
to
seventh
circuit's
attention
and
they
said
that
it
was
of
not
any
relevance
in
this
cause.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
i
certainly
do.
i
think
it
would
be
a
travesty
to
say
that
the
respondent
here
has
a
right
to
sue
for
libel
when
he
has
been
found
guilty
of
the
ultimate
sting
of
the
article
of
violating
monroe's
civil
rights.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
we
used
the
term
guilty
in
the
suit
[attempt
to
laughter]
of
course
in
chicago.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
well,
i
suspect
that,
that
was
something
that
captain
pape
would
have
addressed
to
the
court
in
the
monroe
versus
pape.
these
were
taken
on
appeal,
if
he
had
thought
that,
that
was
truly
the
result.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
well,
i
suggest
to
you
that
the
courts
looked
to
the
sting
of
the
article
and
sting
of
the
article
was
it
violated
the
civil
rights
of
the
monroes
which
is
the
sting
of
the
burden.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
as
i
understand
the
law
of
libel,
a
substantial
truth
is
allowed
and
if
the
gist
of
the
libel
is
a
violation
of
the
civil
rights
of
monroe
--
mr.
don
h.
reuben
this
is
what
--
mr.
don
h.
reuben
--
court
of
appeals.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
the
case
never
went
to
the
jury.
the
district
judge
took
the
case
from
the
jury
and
dismissed
it.
the
court
of
appeals
dismissed
it.
the
article
after
--
mr.
don
h.
reuben
that's
correct.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
that's
correct.
now
i
want
to
go
on
to
the
editorial
process
because
it
didn't
just
stop
with
the
article
being
written
by
mr.
magnuson.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
i
do
not
concede
it,
but
the
district
judge
assumed
it
for
the
purpose
of
deciding
the
motion
at
the
close
of
all
the
evidence.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
my
position
is
i
do
not
concede
that
it
is
false.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
that
is
correct,
but
i
don't
think
that's
before
court.
i
just
--
at
this
moment
the
case
--
mr.
don
h.
reuben
i
think
you
have
to,
i
have
to
be
candid.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
after
the
--
mr.
don
h.
reuben
because
the
district
judge
did
not
--
no
trier
of
fact
has
decided
that.
the
trier
of
fact,
the
district
--
mr.
don
h.
reuben
that's
why
you
have
to
assume
it's
false
and
the
question
is
actual
malice,
that's
the
issue
that
the
district
judge
went
off
on
here.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
that's
correct.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
that's
correct.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
no
i
do
not.
i
do
not
and
the
author
i
think
made
it
very
clear
that
as
he
read
the
entire
civil
rights
commission
report,
it
was
not
an
inaccurate
report.
it
would
be
civil
rights
commission
and
that's
the
thrust
of
his
testimony.
the
civil
rights
commission
was
not
merely
reporting
mr.
monroe's
allegations
in
the
complaint.
the
civil
rights
commission
by
it's
opening
statement,
by
it's
headlines,
by
the
mere
inclusion
of
the
pape
case
was
making
a,
if
you
will,
an
independent
finding
that
this
was
a
case
of
substance
that
merited
a
discussion
and
this
was
precisely
the
view
of
the
dissenting
judge
in
the
first
opinion,
pre-new
york
times
when
the
case
was
decided
on
state
law.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
no
sir,
the
case
is
over.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
nothing
went
to
the
jury.
the
district
--
mr.
don
h.
reuben
because
the
district
judge
dismissed
the
case
at
the
close
of
the
evidence.
if
you
--
mr.
don
h.
reuben
if
you
reverse
the
case
is
over,
if
you
affirm,
the
case
goes
back
to
the
jury.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
i'm
sorry
i
misunderstood
you.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
yes.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
well,
i
think
that
the
best
answer
to
that
is
to
review
what
time
did
here.
mr.
magnuson
whose
testimony
i
read,
the
court
indicated
that
he
thought
from
a
reading
of
the
civil
rights
commission
report
as
a
whole
that
this
was
as
he
said
“there's
more
an
allegation
of
a
complaint
being
reported
here.”
additionally
after
the
article
was
written
and
i
think
the
court
has
to
look
at
this
article
as
though
it
was
uttered
by
time
incorporated,
you
have
to
look
at
the
whole
editorial
process.
the
article
was
sent
to
a
research
department
and
the
morgue
on
captain
pape
or
the
reference
file
which
they
had
was
taken
by
an
independent
researcher
and
there
was
discovered
a
number
of
material
on
monroe
versus
pape,
including
a
new
york
post
article
which
is
in
the
record
and
including
a
time
zone
in-house
dispatches
which
indicated
that
the
incidents
reported
by
the
civil
rights
commission
in
the
words
of
justice
frankfurter
were
true
and
the
combination
of
the
researcher's
independent
judgment
plus
the
editor's
judgment
plus
the
writer's
judgment
resulted
in
an
editorial
decision,
in
an
editorial
decision
to
publish
this
material
in
the
form
that's
before
the
court.
and
in
the
new
york
times
case
and
in
the
st.
amant
case,
the
test
is
of
actual
malice
is
whether
there
was
a
publication
made
by
one
who
published
knowing
it
was
false
and
intending
to
do
harm
through
falsehood
or
as
justice
white
said
in
st.
amant,
“a
high
degree
of
awareness
of
falsity
and
nevertheless
publishing,
intending
to
do
harm
by
publishing
falsehood.”
there
is
not
one
thing
in
this
record
that
indicates
that
this
author
or
this
researcher
or
time
incorporated
had
any
knowledge
of
falsity
or
had
any
awareness
of
falsity.
rather
what
we
believe
and
what
the
district
judge
held
and
what
two
judges
or
at
least
the
first
dissenting
circuit
court
judge
held
was
that
a
fair
reading
of
the
civil
rights
material
alone
could
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
the
report
about
pape
in
the
civil
rights
commission
was
true.
and
i
suggest
if
you
read
the
dissent
in
the
first
pape
case,
decided
pre-new
york
times
and
you
see
there
a
court
of
appeals
judge,
looking
at
the
four
corners
of
justice
and
saying
to
--
in
his
dissent
that
a
reasonable
person
could
read
“justice”
and
conclude
that
times
report
was
an
accurate
report
of
justice.
that
if
an
independent
judgment
like
that
can
be
made,
then
it's
passing
strange
to
say
that
the
author
had
either
knowledge
of
falsity
in
reading
“justice”
when
--
or
had
a
high
degree
of
awareness
of
falsity.
now,
the
seventh
circuit
which
reversed
judge
robson's
holding
that
to
allow
this
case
to
go
to
the
jury
would
have
a
chilling
effect
on
the
first
amendment,
singled
out,
singled
out
the
word
“alleged”
or
the
dropping
of
the
word
“alleged”
and
on
that
basis,
and
on
that
basis
alone
held
that
the
case
had
to
go
to
the
jury
on
the
issue
of
actual
malice.
it
was
that
single
facet
that
prompted
every
reversal
and
what
you
see,
i
submit
to
your
honors,
is
an
ability
by
any
court
in
the
country
to
give
lip
service
to
your
honor's
decisions
in
new
york
times
and
its
progeny
st.
amant
and
the
cases
in
between
and
nevertheless
within
the
framework
of
giving
all
of
the
pi's
(ph)
utterances
possible
to
new
york
times
to
hold
that
a
libel
occurred
or
that
actual
malice
occurred
by
singling
out
one
factor
and
what
--
there
are
at
least
three
vices
in
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
and
what
occurred
here.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
no.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
it
might
i
say
not
in
this
case.
in
this
case
i
think
it
cannot
--
mr.
don
h.
reuben
that's
correct
because
of
the
contents
of
“justice.”
i
think
--
when
the
first
case
was
decided,
of
the
four
judges
that
heard
it,
one
district
court
and
court
of
appeals
judge,
they
held
that
under
the
state
law
pre-new
york
times
that
it
was
not
libel,
that
it
was
a
fair
report
of
“justice”
within
the
four
corners.
now
i'm
not
sure
that
that
rises
to
the
dignity.
i
have
to
--
or
the
first
amendment
right,
but
it
was
an
incorrect
decision
in
my
judgment
and
it
is
not
libelous.
i
think
that
that
time
incorporated
article
was
a
fair
report
of
“justice.”
mr.
don
h.
reuben
although
it
would
be
in
my
judgment
wrong
because
the
mere
act
of
putting
it
in
to
the
a
section
on
police
brutality
and
using
those
incidents,
selecting
incidents
all
over
the
country
and
using
those
incidents
as
a
basis
for
recommendations
to
the
congress
concerning
how
remedial
legislation
should
be
enacted,
takes
it
out
of
the
category
of
just
the
mere
allegation
of
a
complaint.
there
is
a
--
mr.
don
h.
reuben
that
is
the
issue
that
i
think,
has
come
before
the
court
the
way
the
case
was
pitched,
that's
correct.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
you
have
to,
yes
sir.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
yes
sir,
you
have
to
do
that
absolutely.
and
it
is
our
position,
if
you
will,
that
the
record
shows
that
based
upon
all
of
the
facts
of
the
contents
of
justice
and
the
more
it
clips
which
suggests
to
any
reasonable
person
that
this
is
true,
that
it
is
incorrect
for
the
court
of
appeals
to,
if
you
will,
second
guess
the
editorial
process
and
the
editorial
decision
of
time
and
to
say,
that
use
or
no
use
of
language
is
tantamount
to
uttering
deliberate
falsehood
or
is
tantamount
to
uttering
--
well
the
court
of
appeal
didn't
even
suggest
it
was
high
degree
of
awareness,
they
pitched
it
solely
under
the
grounds
of
deliberate
falsehood.
furthermore,
i
suggest
the
court
of
appeals
only
went
one
step
and
said,
well,
in
their
view
you
misstated
a
report
of
government,
but
if
time
incorporated
believed
that
the
ultimate
facts
were
true,
then
there
can
no
malice
under
the
test
of
new
york
times
and
the
record
shows
here.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
well,
i'm
suggesting
to
you
that
in
some
respects
they
did
make
their
own
investigation
by
going
to
the
--
mr.
don
h.
reuben
no,
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
and
i'm
suggesting
to
the
court
that
whether
the
civil
rights
commission
--
whether
times
states
it
on
his
own
authority
or
on
the
civil
rights
commission's
authority,
if
time
incorporated
believed
the
ultimate
fact
to
be
true,
that
the
test
for
actual
malice
is
not
satisfied.
that
if
time
incorporate
believes
the
ultimate
fact
to
be
true,
whether
it
says
that
our
nearest
authority
or
the
civil
rights
commission
--
mr.
don
h.
reuben
he
did
it.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
i
think,
you've
come
to
the
heart
of
the
matter,
i
don't
think
that
the
fact
that
he
misread
or
was
wrong
in
misreading
the
civil
rights
commission
is
enough.
i
think,
you
have
to
have
him
deliberately
intending
to
falsify
what
the
civil
rights
commission
said.
it
is
not
error,
but
it's
an
intension
to
cause
harm
through
the
uttering
of
falsehood
and
that's
not
in
this
record.
and
i
suggest
to
you
that
the
analysis
made
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
reach
that
very
result
was
a
myopic
analysis.
and
it
was
made
by
singling
out
that
fact,
not
looking
at
the
author's
testimony,
not
looking
at
the
district
court's
findings,
not
looking
at
the
clips
or
the
morgue
and
looking
at
the
full
contents
of
justice.
and
just
as
this
court
has
held
that
the
failure
to
investigate
and
that
was
in
the
new
york
times,
does
not
with
convincing
clarity,
and
that's
the
test
as
i
read
the
case,
turn
this
into
actual
malice.
so
the
mere
misreading,
the
mere
error
in
stating
the
report
is
not
actual
malice
as
this
court
has
annunciated
actual
malice.
i
would
like
to
save
five
minutes
for
reply.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
i
do
not
consider
it
irrelevant.
i
consider
it
highly
pertinent
and
indisputable
that
he
is
a
public
official,
he
was
the
–-
mr.
don
h.
reuben
i
would
think
so
but
i
don't
think
you
have
to
reach
it
here.
the
record
shows,
he
was
the
deputy
chief
of
the
detectives,
he
had
chauffeur,
he
had
people
under
him,
he
had
office,
he
had
all
the
trappings
and
when
he
was
on
duty,
he
was
the
chief
of
detective,
because
i
think
he
had
the
night
shift
and
the
day
shift
was
the
chief
of
detectives.
i
think
if
ever
there
was
a
public
official
going
back
to
rosenblum,
captain
pape
is
a
public
official.
mr.
dunne
–-
mr.
don
h.
reuben
mr.
dunne
argues
malice
from
the
tone
of
the
article.
as
i
read
the
cases
of
this
court,
the
issue
is
what
was
the
editorial
process,
what
was
done
by
those
who
prepared
and
authored
the
material
not
what
was
the
final
work
product
and
it's
an
objective,
subjective,
inquiry,
if
you
will.
i
read
in
my
opening
statement,
the
testimony
of
mr.
magnuson
of
what
he
believed,
i
think
also
highly
pertinent
is
the
testimony
which
appears
at
appendix
224
of
the
researcher
who
had
the
article
and
had
the
(inaudible)
and
who
said
the
writer
had
chosen
in
conjunction
with
the
editor
which
material
they
were
going
to
use
out
of
this
particular
quotation
and
checking
back
with
my
own
editorial
reference
files,
i
believe
that
what
we
printed
was
an
accurate
representation
and
we're
not
taking
anything
out
of
context.
i
think
what
the
court
of
appeals
and
mr.
dunne
has
done
is
confused
consciousness
of
the
act,
consciousness
of
what
they
wrote
and
consciousness
of
what
they
did.
with
knowledge
of
falsity,
the
two
are
miles
apart.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
knowledge
of
falsity
of
the
ultimate
facts.
the
ultimate
facts
–-
mr.
don
h.
reuben
he
believed
--
in
his
testimony
as
he
believed
that
in
the
context
of
justice
that
the
word
alleged
were
simply
a
device,
an
editorial
device
of
the
civil
rights
commission
to
introduce
or
discuss
the
pape
case
in
the
language
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
which
the
commission
was
apparently
smitten
with
or
at
least
thought
was
an
accurate
–-
mr.
don
h.
reuben
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
don't
think
there
was
an
imperative
need
but
i
suggest
to
you
that
if
the
case
is
going
to
go
off
on
whether
there
was
an
imperative
need,
then
you
truly
have
a
chilling
effect
on
pruning
it
if
a
court
can
come
back
after
some
years,
in
this
case
ten
years
after
the
fact
and
say,
well,
there's
a
better
way
to
say
this.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
i
suggest
to
you
that
the
chilling
effect
is
to
say
the
time
magazine
that
although
you
honestly
thought
this
was
true,
you
should
have
stated
it
a
different
way
and
because
you
didn't
state
it
a
different
way,
because
we
disagree
what
your
editorial
judgment
that
you
are
guilty
of
actual
malice,
you
are
guilty
of
knowledge
of
falsity.
you
may
disagree
with
their
penmanship,
you
may
disagree
with
their
choice
of
words,
but
i
say
that
as
--
under
the
cases
of
this
court
unless
the
record
shows
with
the
convincing
clarity
that
those
choice
of
words
reflect
knowledge
of
falsity
and
an
intension
to
do
a
malicious
harm
by
publishing
that
falsity
that
there
is
no
actual
malice.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
i
say
there
is
no
liability,
there's
nothing
submissible
to
the
jury
because
–-
mr.
don
h.
reuben
within
the
context
of
what
it
believes
to
be
true,
within
the
context
of
what
–-
of
course
that
isn't
this
case,
but
within
the
context
of
what
it
believes
to
be
true,
it
can't
go
on
and
say,
captain
pape,
according
to
the
civil
rights
commission
did
many
other
incidents.
but
if
it's
tied
in
--
if
it
believes
the
ultimate
facts
are
true
and
there
was
a
deliberate
attempt
here
to
misstate
the
commission's
report
which
i
deny.
i
say
there
is
no
liability.
there
is
nothing
to
go
to
the
jury,
there
is
no
actual
malice.
mr.
don
h.
reuben
no,
i
don't
think
it
is
in
this
case,
absolutely
not.
i
think
in
this
case
--
i
don't
even
concede
it
was
false.
i
think
in
this
case
that
the
first
district
court
decision
and
the
first
dissent
was
correct
and
this
under
common
law
prior
to
new
york
times
was
a
fair
report
of
a
governmental
utterance
and
i
say
that
when
two
judges
say
so,
it
is
passing
strange
to
say
that
when
an
author
so
believes
he
is
guilty
of
publishing
knowing
falsity.
thank
you.
