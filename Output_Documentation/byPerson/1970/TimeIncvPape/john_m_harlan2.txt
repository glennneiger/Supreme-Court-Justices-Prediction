john
m.
harlan
you
don't
have
to
assume
it's
false,
do
you?
all
you
have
to
assume
is
that
there
was
enough
there
to
submit
the
issue
of
falsity
or
not
to
the
jury?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
a
very
good
proposition.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
don't
have
to
assume
and
even,
if
not
concede
that
it's
an
inaccurate
report
of
the
--
of
the
commission
report
that
it
was
purporting
to
be
reporting?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
does
the
record
show
what
considerations
were
alleged
at
that
time
(inaudible)
word
“allege.”
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words
i
guess
what
i
am
getting
at
is
what
is
difference
between
the
new
value
of
one
thing
unless
there
is
value
of
the
other
(inaudible)
that
way?
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
you
say
that
the
time
line
follows
an
accurate
representation,
a
fair
representation
of
the
commission's
report?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
what
respect?
