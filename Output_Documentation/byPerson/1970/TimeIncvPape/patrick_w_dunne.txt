mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
president
nixon
last
summer
made
certain
remarks
in
regard
to
the
manson
trial
and
regard
to
the
(inaudible)
matters,
and
the
press
attacked
him
very
vehemently
for
the
failure
to
use
the
words
“alleged.”
a
week
ago,
on
saturday
night,
president
nixon
had
a
press
conference
and
he
said,
“it
was
wrong.”
time
magazine
read
the
report
of
a
high
governmental
group
which
used
the
words
“alleged.”
they
reported
what
the
commission
said,
as
fact,
the
time
magazine
will
never
say,
they're
wrong.
the
author
of
this
--
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
they
said
that
they
intentionally
stated
something
different
than
the
commission
report,
but
that
they
had
the
right
to
do
it
and
could
do
it
and
were
not
wrong.
because,
i
suppose
based
upon
an
argument
that
in
some
way
the
end
justifies
the
means
that
because
i
suppose
after
306
pages
which
was
the
commission's
report,
the
commission
finally
came
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
police
brutally
in
the
united
states
having
reviewed
many,
many
cases,
i
suppose
that
is
the
ultimate
truth
or
the
ultimate
which
time
feels
justifies
it's
improper
means
of
saying
or
omitting
words
like
“alleged”
and
“complaint.”
the
author
clearly
said,
he
read
it,
he
read
the
words,
alleged
in
a
complaint,
he
understood
them,
but
choose
to
admit
them.
the
omission
of
words,
we
submit,
is
a
known
falsity
and
meets
the
test
of
malice
in
new
york
times.
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
the
man
who
inadvertently,
in
a
print
shop,
drops
out
the
word
allege
is
doing
an
unintentional
act,
doing
unintentional
act
whereas
--
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
it
bears
only
on
malice,
it
truly
bears
only
on
malice,
but
that
is
an
unintentional
act.
here,
the
man
knew
what
he
was
doing,
he
knew
it,
he
intended
to
do
it,
and
left
it
out
and
of
course
the
thing
comes
out
to
be
something
quite
different
then.
what
the
commission
said
first
of
all
and
what
time
was
ostensibly
reporting,
i
might
--
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
well,
it
comes
out
quite
the
same
but
my
point
is
that
we
do
agree,
we
do
agree
that
this
court,
we
do
agree
that
new
york
times,
mr.
sullivan,
this
court
said
that
there
must
be
malice
and
malice
is
of
course,
the
known
falsity
or
the
reckless
disregard
on
whether
or
not
the
falsity
is
true
or
not.
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
surely,
surely
and
what
could
be
a
better
proof
of
malice
than
have
someone,
have
someone
knowingly
report
something
different
from
another
document.
i
might
say
that
this
is
quite
similar
to
a
--
the
contentions
here
are
quite
similar
to
the
contentions
that
time
magazine
has
made
in
the
recent
district
court
case
of
o'donnell
which
recently
has
been
sent
back
in
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
--
the
denial
with
most
of
the
summary
judges
upheld
by
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
in
the
o'donnell
case,
the
same
contentions
were
made.
the
court
says
after
having
reviewed
other
motions
for
summary
judgment
where
the
question
was
investigation
and
so
on
and
so
forth,
and
motions
have
been
granted,
the
court
said,
the
present
case
differs
however,
because
time
had
actual
malice
--
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
the
plaintiff
was
an
attorney.
yet
decided
to
disregard
or
omit
this
fact,
the
first
amendment
does
not
require
that
the
plaintiff
show,
knowledge
of
falsity,
and
then
as
time
contends
bad
faith
in
the
publisher's
choice
of
disregarding
the
truth,
where
the
plaintiff
presents
evidence
to
show
that
the
publisher
chose
to
substitute
his
opinion
for
facts
actually
known
by
him
in
an
article
that
is
capable
of
defamatory
meaning,
he
has
come
forward
with
sufficient
evidence
to
show
reckless
disregard.
this
case
--
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
absolutely
not.
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
the
time
article,
the
time
article
first
of
all
selected
it's
couple
of
examples.
one
being
the
example
of
instance
in
georgia,
employing
not
names,
but
initials
in
a
very,
very
flamboyant
instance,
coming
out
in
the
commission's
report.
one
involving
a
murder,
they
employ
this,
then
they
go
on
down
from
the
south
to
the
north,
and
talk
about
the
incident
of
pape,
and
they
leave
out
the
words
as
--
that
the
commission
said,
“as
alleged
in
a
complaint”,
and
said,
that
the
commission
found
--
a
high
governmental
commission
found
this
police
officer
guilty
of
these
acts
of
police
brutality,
destroying
his
(inaudible)
at
his
own
field
of
work.
so,
it
absolutely
did
not
say
--
it
did
report
what
that
commission
report
said.
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
in
no
way.
first
of
all,
i
believe
that
--
even
the
consideration
of
that
in
this
instance
is
wholly
wrong.
first
of
all,
this
--
these
facts,
these
allegations
of
a
complaint
set
forth
in
justice
frankfurter's
opinion,
we're
not
the
allegations
set
forth
in
the
complaint,
which
was
subject
matter
of
the
jury
verdict.
the
compliant
after
frankfurter
opinion
was
amended
twice
and
watered-down
completely,
there
was
no
such
thing
in
the
complaint
as
pape
having
hit
monroe
with
a
flashlight.
pape
having
called
monroe
a
‘black
boy'
and
that
kind.
that
was
the
complaint
that
the
jury
verdict
was
brought
down,
it
was
much,
much
different.
it
set
all
kinds
of
innocuous
things.
who
am
i
to
say,
what
the
jury
came
to
in
that
case.
it
has
no
credibility
here.
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
in
monroe
versus
pape?
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
well,
if
the
court
please,
i
don't
know
what
went
on
in
monroe
versus
pape,
the
city
of
chicago
offered
the
services
of
it's
officers
to
defend
captain
pape
as
well
as
the
other
police
officers
involved.
they
handled
and
they
did
it.
i
don't
know
and
nor
does
this
record
know
what
the
evidence
went
in
here.
i
do
know
insofar,
as
this
record
is
concerned,
which
i
believe
this
court
and
always
bound
by
it
that
in
order
to
forgo
your
--
in
order
to
satisfy
your
honors
of
what
happened
in
the
incident
of
monroe
versus
pape,
that
we
produced
eight
eye-witnesses
to
that
incident
who's
testimony
of
course
are
in
these
proceedings
and
each
one
of
those
witnesses
denied
that
the
police
officers
broke
in
the
doors,
denied
that
there
were
thirteen
police
officers,
denied
that
they
assaulted
anyone,
denied
that
they
had
the
monroes
standing
in
the
living
room
naked.
all
these
things
are
time
set.
so
the
only
evidence,
as
far
as,
the
incident
concerned,
in
this
case
eye-witnesses
who
testified
to
a
complete
different
approach.
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
no,
no,
the
justice
report
said
that
a
complaint
was
filed
in
which
it
was
alleged
that
these
events
occurred.
the
time
magazine
said
that
the
justice
report
or
the
commission
hound
that
these
things
occurred
and
therein
lies
the
libel
and
therein
lies
the
malice,
because
they
did
it
knowingly
and
with
intention.
i
might
go
on
to
make
a
comment
upon
this
great
and
extensive
investigation
and
verification
made
by
this
worldwide
2000500
circulation
publication,
the
great
investigation
that
they
thought
they
should
do.
they
of
course,
as
mr.
ruben
said,
did
hand
it
over
to
researcher
miss
or
mrs.
booth
who
is
in
the
record.
mrs.
booth
of
course,
did
get
their
morgue
files
on
the
monroe
versus
pape
incident.
she
did
testify
however
that
her
testimony
and
that
of
magnuson
(ph)
clearly
indicates
that
this
morgue
file
was
never
brought
to
the
office
attention.
in
new
york
times
versus
sullivan,
just
exactly
that,
made
the
court
disregard
the
morgue
files
because
it
was
not
brought
to
the
office
attention,
the
person
who
wrote
the
story.
i
might
further
say
that,
if
you
look
at
that
wonderful
morgue
file,
you'll
find
there
were
many,
many
articles
about
the
incident
of
monroe
versus
pape
in
the
morgue
files.
every
one
of
them,
except
one,
every
one
of
them
does
what
the
commission
did.
they
say,
“mr.
monroe
said”
and
tells
what
mr.
monroe's
side
of
the
story
was,
coaching
and
cautioning
and
all
answers
that
are
there,
telling
the
one
side,
which
is
fair
enough
as
far
as,
pape
is
concerned.
everyone,
except
one,
and
one
does
--
not
the
newspaper
article,
nothing
that
anyone
else
had
the
nerve
to
publish,
just
a
dispatch
from
one
of
the
times
chicago
correspondents,
only
one
exhibits
j
--
exhibit
j
is
the
only
one
that
repeats
it
as
fact
and
not
as
a
complaint
that
was
filed
or
a
rule
in
this
court,
in
monroe
versus
pape
or
a
story
which
monroe
told.
i
submit
that
the
--
that
i
do
not
find
and
i
don't
believe
this
court
will
find
but
the
reading
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
opinion
below,
that
the
majority
opinion
stays
with
just
one
element.
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
does
look
to
the
whole
record.
malice
which
is
this
court's
standard
is
the
knowing
falsity,
the
reckless
disregard
of
falsity.
this
case
is
presented
to
the
court
on
a
motion
for
directed
verdict.
what
this
means
usually
is
that,
if
there
is
any
evidence,
not
a
scintilla
of
course,
but
any
evidence,
any
substantial
evidence
from
which
the
jury
could
find
that
time
magazine
was
guilty
of
a
known
falsity
or
reckless
disregard
of
the
truth,
then
the
case
should
have
gone
to
the
jury.
there
is
no
way
that
the
evidence,
or
looking
upon
credibility
of
witnesses
for
this
kind,
but
was
there
any
evidence.
and
what
is
evidence
of
malice?
i
suppose
that's
what
this
case
is
all
about
and
that's
what's
this
court,
or
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
would
call
upon
to
say,
what
is
evidence
of
malice?
we
submit
that
evidence
of
malice
is
many
things.
it's
like
almost
any
question
that
comes
to
a
jury,
all
kinds
of
ingredients
go
into
and
hopefully
from
which
the
jury
draws
it's
inferences
and
comes
to
its
conclusion.
with
malice,
the
nature
of
article
can
be
an
ingredient.
maybe
not
the
only
one,
but
it's
something
to
be
considered.
it's
something
that
the
court
considered
in
new
york
times
versus
sullivan
which
was
an
article
the
court
looked
at
and
had
difficulty
identifying
the
elected
official
who
was
libel,
not
mentioned
by
names
here,
but
the
nature
of
the
article
can
be
some
evidence
of
malice.
here
the
article
is
doodling
(ph)
on
the
corner.
it
incorporates
father
hesburgh's
catchy
remarks
about,
“why
do
we
go
to
the
moon,
when
we
don't
care
of
our
own
house?”
it
again,
uses
a
rather
brutal,
first
paragraph
about
a
situation
in
the
south
by
initials.
yet
goes
into
--
it
goes
into
of
course,
the
pape
incident.
by
the
way,
in
the
course
of
all
these
things,
the
author
did
read
whole
commission
report.
the
commission
report
itself
was
a
very
circumspect
document.
there
were
head
notes
like
searches
and
seizures,
but
the
commission
throughout
its
report
speak
of
alleged
instances,
alleged
this
and
alleged
that.
commission
report
uses
initials
for
the
most
part
when
they're
talking
about
the
persons
who
are
supposedly
guilty
or
alleged,
even
alleged
to
be
guilty
of
certain
facts.
this
article
of
course,
starts
out
with
the
words
--
the
new
paperback
book
has
307
pages
and
the
simple
title
justice.
it
is
the
last
of
five
volumes
of
the
second
report
of
the
u.s.
commission
on
civil
rights,
first
created
by
congress
in
1957.
justice
carries
a
chilling
text
about
police
brutality
in
both
the
south
and
the
north.
justice
carries
an
indictment,
and
it
stands
as
a
grave
indictment,
since
the
facts
were
carefully
investigated
by
the
field
agents
and
it
was
signed
by
all
its
six,
all
six
of
the
noted
educators.
with
that
preview
it
says
pape,
the
commission
found
that
pape
did
these
things,
but
justice
didn't
so
find
it.
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
well
if
the
court
please,
i
don't
believe
as
--
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
yes,
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
time
wasn't
reporting
its
own
judgment
on
the
incident
of
pape
versus
monroe.
it
was
rather
reporting
so
it
says,
what
a
commission
found
is
something
different,
that's
first
of
all.
they
could
certainly,
good
faith
wise,
make
an
investigation,
do
whatever
they
care
to
do,
of
course,
using
the
facilities
and
i
hope
talking
to
somebody,
i
hope
to
talking
to
--
i
hope
at
least
talk
to
somebody
who
was
at
the
incident
but
certainly
if
they
investigated
and
they
went
out
there,
they
talk
to
monroe,
they
talk
to
pape,
or
if
they
talk
to
anybody
that
might
have
been
present,
they
can
say
anything
they
want
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
and
as
far
as
pape
is
concerned
about
the
monroe
incident.
so
they
could
answer
your
question.
they
surely
could
come
in
and
say,
there
was
–-
there
was
on
such
such
a
day
a
campbell
park
(ph)
an
incident
where
a
police
officer
came
in
and
beat
up,
beat
a
--
beat
a
suspect.
they
could
simply
this
even
though
it
was
not
true
they
could
say
it.
so
long
as
they
did
something
and
had
some
basis
for
saying
that
they
talked
to
people,
they
have
made
a
judgment,
made
an
investigation
and
did
something.
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
yes,
if
we
have
--
civil
right
commission
here
which
all
it
said
was
alleged,
couched
its
remarks
in
the
formal
complaint
and
allegations.
an
omission
from
a
--
can
be
malicious
just
as
well
as
anything
else
and
to
knowingly
do
it,
knowingly
and
i
understand
that
you
premise
was
that
i
knew
when
i
was
reporting
the
commission,
the
civil
rights
commission.
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
perfectly
alright,
perfectly
alright.
and
as
matter
of
fact,
was
not
the
time
magazine
which
is
not
a
purveyor
of
hot
news
necessarily
or
someone
who
is
up
against
deadlines
constantly,
i
would
even
feel
that
investigation
on
their
part
could
be
whether
the
slight,
but
they
had
a
week
here
to
do
something.
the
only
thing
that
they
did
do
in
the
course
of
this
so
called
investigation
and
what
the
author
did
that
he's
the
one
whom
we
got
to
look
toward
malice,
though
we
can't
look
toward
the
research
who
doesn't
call
anything
to
the
attention
of
the
author,
the
only
author
did
is
he,
is
he
wired
to
chicago
and
he
said,
what's
the
first
name
of
pape
and
what's
the
address
of
the
apartment
and
was
he
punished
and
of
course
there
in
comes
the
article
again
as
an
element
of
proof
of
malice.
the
article
concludes
with
and
pape
was
not
punished.
they
say
they
drop
the
words
alleged,
drop
the
words
complaint.
they
say
the
commission
found
pape
guilty
of
these
things
and
pape
was
not
punished.
i
mean
that
the
text
of
the
article
itself
is
pretty
inflammatory
and
then
we
come
down
to
the
fact
that
--
you
come
down
to
the
fact
that
they
knew
what
they
were
doing,
they
knew
they're
eliminating
something
and
this
we
submit
is
malice.
this
is
a
known
–-
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
well,
if
the
court
please.
i've
been
working
to
--
get
to
the
jury
for
like
nine
years
having
been
on
--
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
my
point
is
--
my
point
is
that,
i
will
defend
the
–-
i
will
defend
the
pape
incident
no
matter
how
it's
couched
as
far
as
incident
itself
–-
cause
no
allegation.
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
mr.
justice,
it's
exactly
true,
that's
my
position.
i
will
say
however
and
i'll
just
add
caveat
to
it
that
we
already
put
on
eight
witness,
eight
eyewitness
to
the
pape
incident
so
that
the
time
can't
prove
that
what
happened
in
the
incident
of
monroe
was
true,
solely
as
they
say
in
their
news,
in
their
article.
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
it
certainly
would.
it
wouldn't
do
the
one
the
thing
that
i
say
should
have
happened
anyway.
it
certainly
wouldn't
say
that
the
matter
should
be
left
to
the
jury.
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
well,
of
course,
i
feel
that
the
verdict
as
a
matter
of
technical
rules
of
evidence
which
i
certainly
don't
want
to
get
into
before
this
court,
the
verdict
and
the
–-
the
verdict
in
civil
rights
and
the
verdict
in
monroe
versus
pape
base
on
this.
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
there
is
no
place
as
a
matter
of
evidence.
in
this
case,
in
pape
versus
time
inc.
for
the
simple
reason
that
in
this
instance
say
it's
not
on
same
complaint
and
i
suppose
and
we
did
feel
when
we
tried
the
case
that
it
was
necessary
to
put
on
evidence
of
the
incident
of
monroe.
we
did
put
on
such
evidence.
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
feel
that
was
even
necessary.
they
felt
what
we
were
dealing
with
is
not
what
happened
on
that
night
campbell
park
(ph),
but
what
was
happening
in
the
commission
report
and
i
agree
with
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
but
we
did
put
it
on.
we
probably
would
put
it
on
again
and
time
of
course,
can
put
on
any
evidence
it
cares
to
and
the
jury
can
draw
any
conclusions
that
it
cares
to
insofar
as
the
incident
is
concerned.
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
yes,
sir.
shifting
to
the
north,
the
report
cites
chicago
treatment
of
negro
james
monroe
and
his
family,
who
were
awakened
in
their
west
side

at
5:45
by
13
police
officers,
ostensibly
investigating
a
murder.
the
police,
says
justice,
broke
through
two
doors,
woke
the
monroe

with
flashlights
and
forced
them
at
gunpoint
to
leave
their

and
stand
naked
in
the

of
the

the
officers
roused
the

and

them
into

mr.

several
times
with
his

calling
him
a

and
black

another

pushed
mrs.
monroe
etcetera,
etcetera,
etcetera.
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
this
is
the
--
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
in
a
complaint.
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
i
say
because
they
left
out
the
words
alleged
in
compliant,
that
there
is
sufficient
evidence
in
this
matter
to
warrant
the
case
to
go
to
a
jury.
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
it
really
does
mr.
justice.
it
really
does.
it
gets
down
to
–-
it
gets
down
to
--
into
--
should
the
case
go
to
the
jury,
i
certainly
agree
and
to
sum
up,
i
agree
with
the
court
that
freedom
of
press
is
a
precious
thing
and
it
is
something
that
we
should
protect,
and
this
court
to
protect,
and
this
court
has
nurtured
through
the
years.
i
think
that
a
detective,
a
police
officer,
also
like
all
other
people
have
a
right
of
privacy.
these
things
do
come
in
into
conflict
and
they
have
here.
i
think
they
also
have
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
as
we
also
have
here.
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
that
we
–-
that
there
is
sufficient,
that
there
is
enough
evidence
to
go
to
a
jury
and
the
question
of
malice,
that
isn't.
knowledge
of
falsity
and
pape
--
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
the
court
should
not
have
taken
it
away
for
the
jury.
thank
you
gentlemen.
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
president
nixon
last
summer
made
certain
remarks
in
regard
to
the
manson
trial
and
regard
to
the
(inaudible)
matters,
and
the
press
attacked
him
very
vehemently
for
the
failure
to
use
the
words
“alleged.”
a
week
ago,
on
saturday
night,
president
nixon
had
a
press
conference
and
he
said,
“it
was
wrong.”
time
magazine
read
the
report
of
a
high
governmental
group
which
used
the
words
“alleged.”
they
reported
what
the
commission
said,
as
fact,
the
time
magazine
will
never
say,
they're
wrong.
the
author
of
this
--
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
they
said
that
they
intentionally
stated
something
different
than
the
commission
report,
but
that
they
had
the
right
to
do
it
and
could
do
it
and
were
not
wrong.
because,
i
suppose
based
upon
an
argument
that
in
some
way
the
end
justifies
the
means
that
because
i
suppose
after
306
pages
which
was
the
commission's
report,
the
commission
finally
came
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
police
brutally
in
the
united
states
having
reviewed
many,
many
cases,
i
suppose
that
is
the
ultimate
truth
or
the
ultimate
which
time
feels
justifies
it's
improper
means
of
saying
or
omitting
words
like
“alleged”
and
“complaint.”
the
author
clearly
said,
he
read
it,
he
read
the
words,
alleged
in
a
complaint,
he
understood
them,
but
choose
to
admit
them.
the
omission
of
words,
we
submit,
is
a
known
falsity
and
meets
the
test
of
malice
in
new
york
times.
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
the
man
who
inadvertently,
in
a
print
shop,
drops
out
the
word
allege
is
doing
an
unintentional
act,
doing
unintentional
act
whereas
--
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
it
bears
only
on
malice,
it
truly
bears
only
on
malice,
but
that
is
an
unintentional
act.
here,
the
man
knew
what
he
was
doing,
he
knew
it,
he
intended
to
do
it,
and
left
it
out
and
of
course
the
thing
comes
out
to
be
something
quite
different
then.
what
the
commission
said
first
of
all
and
what
time
was
ostensibly
reporting,
i
might
--
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
well,
it
comes
out
quite
the
same
but
my
point
is
that
we
do
agree,
we
do
agree
that
this
court,
we
do
agree
that
new
york
times,
mr.
sullivan,
this
court
said
that
there
must
be
malice
and
malice
is
of
course,
the
known
falsity
or
the
reckless
disregard
on
whether
or
not
the
falsity
is
true
or
not.
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
surely,
surely
and
what
could
be
a
better
proof
of
malice
than
have
someone,
have
someone
knowingly
report
something
different
from
another
document.
i
might
say
that
this
is
quite
similar
to
a
--
the
contentions
here
are
quite
similar
to
the
contentions
that
time
magazine
has
made
in
the
recent
district
court
case
of
o'donnell
which
recently
has
been
sent
back
in
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
--
the
denial
with
most
of
the
summary
judges
upheld
by
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
in
the
o'donnell
case,
the
same
contentions
were
made.
the
court
says
after
having
reviewed
other
motions
for
summary
judgment
where
the
question
was
investigation
and
so
on
and
so
forth,
and
motions
have
been
granted,
the
court
said,
the
present
case
differs
however,
because
time
had
actual
malice
--
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
the
plaintiff
was
an
attorney.
yet
decided
to
disregard
or
omit
this
fact,
the
first
amendment
does
not
require
that
the
plaintiff
show,
knowledge
of
falsity,
and
then
as
time
contends
bad
faith
in
the
publisher's
choice
of
disregarding
the
truth,
where
the
plaintiff
presents
evidence
to
show
that
the
publisher
chose
to
substitute
his
opinion
for
facts
actually
known
by
him
in
an
article
that
is
capable
of
defamatory
meaning,
he
has
come
forward
with
sufficient
evidence
to
show
reckless
disregard.
this
case
--
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
absolutely
not.
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
the
time
article,
the
time
article
first
of
all
selected
it's
couple
of
examples.
one
being
the
example
of
instance
in
georgia,
employing
not
names,
but
initials
in
a
very,
very
flamboyant
instance,
coming
out
in
the
commission's
report.
one
involving
a
murder,
they
employ
this,
then
they
go
on
down
from
the
south
to
the
north,
and
talk
about
the
incident
of
pape,
and
they
leave
out
the
words
as
--
that
the
commission
said,
“as
alleged
in
a
complaint”,
and
said,
that
the
commission
found
--
a
high
governmental
commission
found
this
police
officer
guilty
of
these
acts
of
police
brutality,
destroying
his
(inaudible)
at
his
own
field
of
work.
so,
it
absolutely
did
not
say
--
it
did
report
what
that
commission
report
said.
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
in
no
way.
first
of
all,
i
believe
that
--
even
the
consideration
of
that
in
this
instance
is
wholly
wrong.
first
of
all,
this
--
these
facts,
these
allegations
of
a
complaint
set
forth
in
justice
frankfurter's
opinion,
we're
not
the
allegations
set
forth
in
the
complaint,
which
was
subject
matter
of
the
jury
verdict.
the
compliant
after
frankfurter
opinion
was
amended
twice
and
watered-down
completely,
there
was
no
such
thing
in
the
complaint
as
pape
having
hit
monroe
with
a
flashlight.
pape
having
called
monroe
a
‘black
boy'
and
that
kind.
that
was
the
complaint
that
the
jury
verdict
was
brought
down,
it
was
much,
much
different.
it
set
all
kinds
of
innocuous
things.
who
am
i
to
say,
what
the
jury
came
to
in
that
case.
it
has
no
credibility
here.
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
in
monroe
versus
pape?
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
well,
if
the
court
please,
i
don't
know
what
went
on
in
monroe
versus
pape,
the
city
of
chicago
offered
the
services
of
it's
officers
to
defend
captain
pape
as
well
as
the
other
police
officers
involved.
they
handled
and
they
did
it.
i
don't
know
and
nor
does
this
record
know
what
the
evidence
went
in
here.
i
do
know
insofar,
as
this
record
is
concerned,
which
i
believe
this
court
and
always
bound
by
it
that
in
order
to
forgo
your
--
in
order
to
satisfy
your
honors
of
what
happened
in
the
incident
of
monroe
versus
pape,
that
we
produced
eight
eye-witnesses
to
that
incident
who's
testimony
of
course
are
in
these
proceedings
and
each
one
of
those
witnesses
denied
that
the
police
officers
broke
in
the
doors,
denied
that
there
were
thirteen
police
officers,
denied
that
they
assaulted
anyone,
denied
that
they
had
the
monroes
standing
in
the
living
room
naked.
all
these
things
are
time
set.
so
the
only
evidence,
as
far
as,
the
incident
concerned,
in
this
case
eye-witnesses
who
testified
to
a
complete
different
approach.
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
no,
no,
the
justice
report
said
that
a
complaint
was
filed
in
which
it
was
alleged
that
these
events
occurred.
the
time
magazine
said
that
the
justice
report
or
the
commission
hound
that
these
things
occurred
and
therein
lies
the
libel
and
therein
lies
the
malice,
because
they
did
it
knowingly
and
with
intention.
i
might
go
on
to
make
a
comment
upon
this
great
and
extensive
investigation
and
verification
made
by
this
worldwide
2000500
circulation
publication,
the
great
investigation
that
they
thought
they
should
do.
they
of
course,
as
mr.
ruben
said,
did
hand
it
over
to
researcher
miss
or
mrs.
booth
who
is
in
the
record.
mrs.
booth
of
course,
did
get
their
morgue
files
on
the
monroe
versus
pape
incident.
she
did
testify
however
that
her
testimony
and
that
of
magnuson
(ph)
clearly
indicates
that
this
morgue
file
was
never
brought
to
the
office
attention.
in
new
york
times
versus
sullivan,
just
exactly
that,
made
the
court
disregard
the
morgue
files
because
it
was
not
brought
to
the
office
attention,
the
person
who
wrote
the
story.
i
might
further
say
that,
if
you
look
at
that
wonderful
morgue
file,
you'll
find
there
were
many,
many
articles
about
the
incident
of
monroe
versus
pape
in
the
morgue
files.
every
one
of
them,
except
one,
every
one
of
them
does
what
the
commission
did.
they
say,
“mr.
monroe
said”
and
tells
what
mr.
monroe's
side
of
the
story
was,
coaching
and
cautioning
and
all
answers
that
are
there,
telling
the
one
side,
which
is
fair
enough
as
far
as,
pape
is
concerned.
everyone,
except
one,
and
one
does
--
not
the
newspaper
article,
nothing
that
anyone
else
had
the
nerve
to
publish,
just
a
dispatch
from
one
of
the
times
chicago
correspondents,
only
one
exhibits
j
--
exhibit
j
is
the
only
one
that
repeats
it
as
fact
and
not
as
a
complaint
that
was
filed
or
a
rule
in
this
court,
in
monroe
versus
pape
or
a
story
which
monroe
told.
i
submit
that
the
--
that
i
do
not
find
and
i
don't
believe
this
court
will
find
but
the
reading
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
opinion
below,
that
the
majority
opinion
stays
with
just
one
element.
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
does
look
to
the
whole
record.
malice
which
is
this
court's
standard
is
the
knowing
falsity,
the
reckless
disregard
of
falsity.
this
case
is
presented
to
the
court
on
a
motion
for
directed
verdict.
what
this
means
usually
is
that,
if
there
is
any
evidence,
not
a
scintilla
of
course,
but
any
evidence,
any
substantial
evidence
from
which
the
jury
could
find
that
time
magazine
was
guilty
of
a
known
falsity
or
reckless
disregard
of
the
truth,
then
the
case
should
have
gone
to
the
jury.
there
is
no
way
that
the
evidence,
or
looking
upon
credibility
of
witnesses
for
this
kind,
but
was
there
any
evidence.
and
what
is
evidence
of
malice?
i
suppose
that's
what
this
case
is
all
about
and
that's
what's
this
court,
or
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
would
call
upon
to
say,
what
is
evidence
of
malice?
we
submit
that
evidence
of
malice
is
many
things.
it's
like
almost
any
question
that
comes
to
a
jury,
all
kinds
of
ingredients
go
into
and
hopefully
from
which
the
jury
draws
it's
inferences
and
comes
to
its
conclusion.
with
malice,
the
nature
of
article
can
be
an
ingredient.
maybe
not
the
only
one,
but
it's
something
to
be
considered.
it's
something
that
the
court
considered
in
new
york
times
versus
sullivan
which
was
an
article
the
court
looked
at
and
had
difficulty
identifying
the
elected
official
who
was
libel,
not
mentioned
by
names
here,
but
the
nature
of
the
article
can
be
some
evidence
of
malice.
here
the
article
is
doodling
(ph)
on
the
corner.
it
incorporates
father
hesburgh's
catchy
remarks
about,
“why
do
we
go
to
the
moon,
when
we
don't
care
of
our
own
house?”
it
again,
uses
a
rather
brutal,
first
paragraph
about
a
situation
in
the
south
by
initials.
yet
goes
into
--
it
goes
into
of
course,
the
pape
incident.
by
the
way,
in
the
course
of
all
these
things,
the
author
did
read
whole
commission
report.
the
commission
report
itself
was
a
very
circumspect
document.
there
were
head
notes
like
searches
and
seizures,
but
the
commission
throughout
its
report
speak
of
alleged
instances,
alleged
this
and
alleged
that.

uses
initials
for
the
most
part
when
they're
talking
about
the
persons
who
are
supposedly
guilty
or
alleged,
even
alleged
to
be
guilty
of
certain
facts.
this
article
of
course,
starts
out
with
the
words
--
the
new
paperback
book
has
307
pages
and
the
simple
title
justice.
it
is
the
last
of
five
volumes
of
the
second
report
of
the
u.s.
commission
on
civil
rights,
first
created
by
congress
in
1957.
justice
carries
a
chilling
text
about
police
brutality
in
both
the
south
and
the
north.
justice
carries
an
indictment,
and
it
stands
as
a
grave
indictment,
since
the
facts
were
carefully
investigated
by
the
field
agents
and
it
was
signed
by
all
its
six,
all
six
of
the
noted
educators.
with
that
preview
it
says
pape,
the
commission
found
that
pape
did
these
things,
but
justice
didn't
so
find
it.
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
well
if
the
court
please,
i
don't
believe
as
--
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
yes,
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
time
wasn't
reporting
its
own
judgment
on
the
incident
of
pape
versus
monroe.
it
was
rather
reporting
so
it
says,
what
a
commission
found
is
something
different,
that's
first
of
all.
they
could
certainly,
good
faith
wise,
make
an
investigation,
do
whatever
they
care
to
do,
of
course,
using
the
facilities
and
i
hope
talking
to
somebody,
i
hope
to
talking
to
--
i
hope
at
least
talk
to
somebody
who
was
at
the
incident
but
certainly
if
they
investigated
and
they
went
out
there,
they
talk
to
monroe,
they
talk
to
pape,
or
if
they
talk
to
anybody
that
might
have
been
present,
they
can
say
anything
they
want
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
and
as
far
as
pape
is
concerned
about
the
monroe
incident.
so
they
could
answer
your
question.
they
surely
could
come
in
and
say,
there
was
–-
there
was
on
such
such
a
day
a
campbell
park
(ph)
an
incident
where
a
police
officer
came
in
and
beat
up,
beat
a
--
beat
a
suspect.
they
could
simply
this
even
though
it
was
not
true
they
could
say
it.
so
long
as
they
did
something
and
had
some
basis
for
saying
that
they
talked
to
people,
they
have
made
a
judgment,
made
an
investigation
and
did
something.
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
yes,
if
we
have
--
civil
right
commission
here
which
all
it
said
was
alleged,
couched
its
remarks
in
the
formal
complaint
and
allegations.
an
omission
from
a
--
can
be
malicious
just
as
well
as
anything
else
and
to
knowingly
do
it,
knowingly
and
i
understand
that
you
premise
was
that
i
knew
when
i
was
reporting
the
commission,
the
civil
rights
commission.
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
perfectly
alright,
perfectly
alright.
and
as
matter
of
fact,
was
not
the
time
magazine
which
is
not
a
purveyor
of
hot
news
necessarily
or
someone
who
is
up
against
deadlines
constantly,
i
would
even
feel
that
investigation
on
their
part
could
be
whether
the
slight,
but
they
had
a
week
here
to
do
something.
the
only
thing
that
they
did
do
in
the
course
of
this
so
called
investigation
and
what
the
author
did
that
he's
the
one
whom
we
got
to
look
toward
malice,
though
we
can't
look
toward
the
research
who
doesn't
call
anything
to
the
attention
of
the
author,
the
only
author
did
is
he,
is
he
wired
to
chicago
and
he
said,
what's
the
first
name
of
pape
and
what's
the
address
of
the
apartment
and
was
he
punished
and
of
course
there
in
comes
the
article
again
as
an
element
of
proof
of
malice.
the
article
concludes
with
and
pape
was
not
punished.
they
say
they
drop
the
words
alleged,
drop
the
words
complaint.
they
say
the
commission
found
pape
guilty
of
these
things
and
pape
was
not
punished.
i
mean
that
the
text
of
the
article
itself
is
pretty
inflammatory
and
then
we
come
down
to
the
fact
that
--
you
come
down
to
the
fact
that
they
knew
what
they
were
doing,
they
knew
they're
eliminating
something
and
this
we
submit
is
malice.
this
is
a
known
–-
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
well,
if
the
court
please.
i've
been
working
to
--
get
to
the
jury
for
like
nine
years
having
been
on
--
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
my
point
is
--
my
point
is
that,
i
will
defend
the
–-
i
will
defend
the
pape
incident
no
matter
how
it's
couched
as
far
as
incident
itself
–-
cause
no
allegation.
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
mr.
justice,
it's
exactly
true,
that's
my
position.
i
will
say
however
and
i'll
just
add
caveat
to
it
that
we
already
put
on
eight
witness,
eight
eyewitness
to
the
pape
incident
so
that
the
time
can't
prove
that
what
happened
in
the
incident
of
monroe
was
true,
solely
as
they
say
in
their
news,
in
their
article.
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
it
certainly
would.
it
wouldn't
do
the
one
the
thing
that
i
say
should
have
happened
anyway.
it
certainly
wouldn't
say
that
the
matter
should
be
left
to
the
jury.
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
well,
of
course,
i
feel
that
the
verdict
as
a
matter
of
technical
rules
of
evidence
which
i
certainly
don't
want
to
get
into
before
this
court,
the
verdict
and
the
–-
the
verdict
in
civil
rights
and
the
verdict
in
monroe
versus
pape
base
on
this.
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
there
is
no
place
as
a
matter
of
evidence.
in
this
case,
in
pape
versus
time
inc.
for
the
simple
reason
that
in
this
instance
say
it's
not
on
same
complaint
and
i
suppose
and
we
did
feel
when
we
tried
the
case
that
it
was
necessary
to
put
on
evidence
of
the
incident
of
monroe.
we
did
put
on
such
evidence.
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
feel
that
was
even
necessary.
they
felt
what
we
were
dealing
with
is
not
what
happened
on
that
night
campbell
park
(ph),
but
what
was
happening
in
the
commission
report
and
i
agree
with
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
but
we
did
put
it
on.
we
probably
would
put
it
on
again
and
time
of
course,
can
put
on
any
evidence
it
cares
to
and
the
jury
can
draw
any
conclusions
that
it
cares
to
insofar
as
the
incident
is
concerned.
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
yes,
sir.
shifting
to
the
north,
the
report
cites
chicago
treatment
of
negro
james
monroe
and
his
family,
who
were
awakened
in
their
west
side
apartment
at
5:45
by
13
police
officers,
ostensibly
investigating
a
murder.
the
police,
says
justice,
broke
through
two
doors,
woke
the
monroe
couple
with
flashlights
and
forced
them
at
gunpoint
to
leave
their
beds
and
stand
naked
in
the
center
of
the
living
room.
the
officers
roused
the
six
monroe
children
and
herded
them
into
the
living
room.
detective
frank
pape
struck
mr.
monroe
several
times
with
his
flashlight,
calling
him
a
nigger
and
black
boy.
another
officer
pushed
mrs.
monroe
etcetera,
etcetera,
etcetera.
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
this
is
the
--
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
in
a
complaint.
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
i
say
because
they
left
out
the
words
alleged
in
compliant,
that
there
is
sufficient
evidence
in
this
matter
to
warrant
the
case
to
go
to
a
jury.
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
it
really
does
mr.
justice.
it
really
does.
it
gets
down
to
–-
it
gets
down
to
--
into
--
should
the
case
go
to
the
jury,
i
certainly
agree
and
to
sum
up,
i
agree
with
the
court
that
freedom
of
press
is
a
precious
thing
and
it
is
something
that
we
should
protect,
and
this
court
to
protect,
and
this
court
has
nurtured
through
the
years.
i
think
that
a
detective,
a
police
officer,
also
like
all
other
people
have
a
right
of
privacy.
these
things
do
come
in
into
conflict
and
they
have
here.
i
think
they
also
have
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
as
we
also
have
here.
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
that
we
–-
that
there
is
sufficient,
that
there
is
enough
evidence
to
go
to
a
jury
and
the
question
of
malice,
that
isn't.
knowledge
of
falsity
and
pape
--
mr.
patrick
w.
dunne
the
court
should
not
have
taken
it
away
for
the
jury.
thank
you
gentlemen.
