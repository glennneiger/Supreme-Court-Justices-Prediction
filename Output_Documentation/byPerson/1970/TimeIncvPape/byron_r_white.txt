justice
byron
r.
white
it
wasn't
just
a
negligent
omission.
it
was
a
thoughtful,
knowing
deliberate
omission
of
the
word
“alleged?”
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
of
his
knowing
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
knew
exactly
what
he
was
doing?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
of
course
the
officer
might
have
been
found
guilty
of
or
found
liable
for
violating
civil
rights
without
having
committed
the
acts
which
are
alleged
in
the
story?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
is
really
a
rather
critical
point,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know,
but
i
mean
to
recover
it
all
on
libel
suit,
you
just
don't
find
whether
somebody
was
stung
or
not
stung,
you
find
whether
some
statements
were
true
or
untrue
among
other
things?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
gather
though
if
it
had
been
found
in
this
case
that,
at
least
it
can
be
said
that
the
report
that
was
published
was
a
false
report
of
the
what
was
said
in
the
civil
rights
report?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
one
step.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
secondly
it
was
--
it
must
have
been
found
by
the
jury
that
the
statements
substantively
were
false,
some
of
them
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it
never
been
found
in
this
case
substantively?
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
any
of
the
statements
in
the
civil
rights
report
are
true
or
false?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
i
think
that
you
don't
--
part
of
submission
is
that
the
first
amendment
would
preclude
(inaudible)
leaving
out
the
word
“alleged”
would
be
vital?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
that
the
underlying
statements
were
false,
leaving
out
the
word
“alleged”
you
say
fairly
reads
out
the
libel's
perspective?
justice
byron
r.
white
wholly
aside
from
the
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
sort
of
thing
that
justice
harlan
(inaudible)
think
the
edge
and
the
word
“alleged,”
that's
all
it
was
in
the
report,
the
“justice”
report
saying
alleged
(inaudible)
and
that
word
was
left
out
you
would
say
that
would
be
--
the
only
thing
unconstitutional
in
holding
that
being
libel.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
i
gather
is
that
your
view
is
solely
on
balance?
justice
byron
r.
white
assuming
libel
--
libel's
falsity
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
(inaudible)
function
made
part
of
the
authorities
on
civil

commission
(inaudible).
civil

this

rather
than
just
(inaudible)
reminds
me
(inaudible)
saying
civil

--
justice

white
(inaudible)
gather
some
stories
--
justice
byron

white
(inaudible)
is
concerned
that
the
civil

commission
saying
this
as
a
matter
of
fact.
justice
byron

white
(inaudible)
this
case
proceeded
with
the
(inaudible)
was
leaving
out
towards
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
knowingly
and
he
was
wrong
in
assuming
that
that's
what
the
civil
rights
commission
meant,
he
knowingly
misstated?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
any
evidence
with
the
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
dunne,
why
do
you
think
or
do
you
think
that
time
magazine
could
have
had
a
good
faith
in
non
malicious
belief
and
the
truth
of
the
underlying
allegations,
but
nevertheless
be
liable
in
this
case
because
it
misstated,
knowingly
misstated
the
commission's
report
by
leaving
out
the
word
alleged.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
just
assume
for
the
moment
though
that
time
had
a
good
faith,
non
malicious
belief
in
the
truth
of
the
allegations
about,
that
it
made
about
pape,
let's
just
assume
that.
now,
would
time
nevertheless
be
liable
because
it
left
out
the
word
alleged
and
misstated
the
commission?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
it
would
be
--
let's
assume
you
wanted
to
say
something
about
someone
that
you
thought
was
true
and
you
have
investigated,
you
had
reasonable
grounds
to
think
it
was
true
and
it
wouldn't
be
malicious
in
saying
it.
and
you
say,
so
and
so
and
then
you
add
another
paragraph
and
by
the
way
the
civil
rights
commission
thinks
just
like
i
do
also.
and
do
you
suppose
that
you
would
be
--
that
you
would
have
--
could
be
held
to
be
malicious
just
because
it
was
untrue
that
the
civil
rights
commission
agreed
with
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
in
this
case.
although
i
think
he
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
knowledge
of
falsity
of
what
mr.
reuben?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
let's
assume
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
reuben,
in
this
case
if
time
magazine
not
only
was
conscious
of
what
it
was
doing
but
knew
that
it
was
misstating
the
commission's
report
but
it
believed
in
the
truth
in
good
faith
of
the
underlying
allegations,
what
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
the
time
magazine
is
perfectly
free
as
long
as
it
believes
–-
as
long
as
it
says
we
have
good
faith
belief
in
the

time
magazine
is
free
to
say
anything
it
wants
to
about
the
civil

is

critical
to
your

in
