in

mr.

what
you

if

they
wanted

they

the
civil

commission
investigated
it

it's

we
don't

this
merely
alleged,

gather
on
your

mr.

even
if
this

goes
back

and
as
part
of
their
defense
the

were
to
prove
in

that
all
these
things
that
were
said
about
captain
pape
were
true
even
if
they
were

you'd
still
say
you
were
entitled

go
to
the

of
malice

they
had
as
i
gather
you
would
put

falsely
stated

said?

no,
won't
you
answer
my

i
take
it
you'd
