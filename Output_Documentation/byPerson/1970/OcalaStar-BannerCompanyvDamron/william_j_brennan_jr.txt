justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
dunn,
may
i
just
look
again
at
pages
80
and
81
with
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather,
in
your
argument
that
there
was
an
admission
of
liability?
is
this,
what
you
suggest
that
judge
states
when
he
says,
“well,
i
think
liability
is
to
compensatory
damages
as
admitted
in
this
case?”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
what
--
mr.
aires
was
your
adversary?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
does
this
mean
over
at
81?
i
notice
there's
a
lot
of
omissions
but
by
the
court
that's
right,
and
whether
or
not
the
plaintiffs
suffered
any
damage
by
reason
of
it
is
a
matter
for
them
to
decide.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
aires
in
other
words,
i
don't
take
it
that
your
ruling
comprehends
an
instruction
by
you
to
the
jury
that
they
must
return
a
verdict
for
the
plaintiff
because
of
the
publication
standing
alone
without
more?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
doesn't
that
imply
that
there's
no
concession
of
liability
or
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
where
and
what
follows,
mr.
dunn
that
81
to
83,
i
notice
there
are
omissions.
did
the
judge
tell
the
jury
that
liability
was
admitted?
is
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
you
point
that
out
to
me?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
on
that
same
statute
mr.
dunn
[attempt
to
laughter]
did
you
oppose
on
the
appeal
to
the
part
of
florida
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
did
you
--
was
one
of
your
arguments
that
why
they
can't
have
an
appeal
because
they
conceded
liability?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
did
not
make
that
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
want
to
answer
this
question,
don't
mr.
dunn,
but
why
didn't
you
take
the
position
in
the
new
york
--
in
the
florida
court
of
appeals
that
they
conceded
liability?
justice
william
j.
