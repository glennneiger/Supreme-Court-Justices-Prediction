we'll
hear
arguments
next
in

the
ocala
star-banner
company
against
damron.
mr.
wahl,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what's
the
significance
of
your
position
there?
in
florida
pleading
must
they
allege
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
think
a
jury
could
reasonably
find
that
he
lost
the
election
because
of
the
article?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
setting
aside
all
of
the
factors?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
they
reasonably
find
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
did
they
do
about
it,
if
anything?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
he
is
bound
by
new
york
times,
that's
what
you
mean?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
has
put
himself
in
the
news
--
new
york
times
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don't
think
--
you're
not
suggesting
he
waived
any
of
his
rights
by
doing
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
wahl.
mr.
dunn.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
raise
your
voice
a
little
counsel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
the
judge
directed
a
verdict,
to
use
the
term
that
your
friend
used,
he
was
directing
that
in
effect
pursuant
to
concession
of
liability?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
do
we
find
that
in
the
appendix,
i
don't
have
it
my
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
only
for
compensatory
damages?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
you
enlighten
us
on
page
80
whether
the
omissions
of
the
bottom
of
the
page
after
the
judge's
statement,
“well,
i
think
liability
as
to
compensatory
damages
is
admitted
in
this
case,
what
dialogue,
what
colloquy
took
place
after
that?”
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then
i
should
think
that's
quite
relevant
to
the
question
that
you
have
pressed
on
us
that
liability
for
compensatory
damages
was
admitted
and
perhaps
you
want
to
supply
that
permission
from
the
record.
do
we
have
it
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
at
this
stage,
the
posture
of
the
case
is
that
the
jury
thought
that
he
had
lost
these
jobs
because
of
the
defamatory
statements?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
don't
have
to
go
outside
the
record,
do
you?
the
jury's
verdict
speaks
for
itself.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
that
you
will
find
it
if
i
may
suggest
it
in
your
brief
in
opposition
to
petition
for
the
writ
in
the
first
place
on
page
five,
in
that
colloquy
even
though
it's
not
complete
mr.
aires,
your
opposing
counsel
said,
he
still
has
to
prove
his
damages.
he
still
has
to
prove
his
damages,
its
part
of
the
matter
justice
brennan
just
referred
to
as
represented
by
an
omission
in
the
appendix.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
argue
i
take
it
that
this
is
consistent
with
your
position
that
he
had
waived
any
claims
about
liability.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
do
you
think
we
can
rely
on
the
complete
record
when
we
see
in
this.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
know
whether
it's
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
should
be
left
with
the
clerk
if
it
isn't
already
on
file.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
say
that
mr.
aires
meant
when
he
said
at
page
5
of
the
opposition
to
cert,
he
still
has
to
prove
his
damages?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
he
say,
when
the
court
--
when
the
court
announced,
i
think
liability
is
admitted
in
this
case,
did
he
say
anything?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
the
florida
--
an
appellate
court
in
florida
would
have
taken
some

on
the

at
that

e.

you
