mr.
wallace
dunn
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
members
of
the
court.
a
rebuttal
to
mr.
wahl's
comments
--
mr.
wallace
dunn
yes,
sir.
i
like
to
point
out
some
various
salient
features
in
this
case.
i
will
concur
with
mr.
wahl
on
one
thing,
it
is
an
unusual
case.
the
original
complaint,
and
i
filed
the
original
complaint,
was
filed
in
1966,
but
this
case
was
not
tried
until
january
1968.
as
pointed
out
in
my
brief,
just
prior
to
the
trial
of
this
case,
the
trial
attorney
admitted
liability
on
behalf
of
the
defendants
and
we
tried
this
case
strictly
on
the
question
of
damages.
however,
in
working
--
mr.
wallace
dunn
yes,
this
is
quite
correct.
and
this
is
the
reason
for
the
--
mr.
wallace
dunn
sir?
mr.
wallace
dunn
the
fact
--
the
only
place
in
the
record
that
you
can
--
that
has
a
direct
reference
to
it,
sir,
is
the
comment
of
the
judge
at
the
time
he
directed
the
verdict.
in
other
words
--
mr.
wallace
dunn
it's
on
page
80
of
the
appendix,
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
mr.
wallace
dunn
yes,
sir.
i
had
made
my
application
for
a
directed
verdict
at
the
conclusion
of
the
evidence
and
the
court
at
the
point
of
discussion
pointed
out
why
i
think
liability
as
to
compensatory
damages
is
admitted
in
this
case,
not
proven
that
the
word
admitted
was
used
and
this
is
exactly
what
happened
and
that
is
a
reason
for
the
candor
in
which
this
was
tried.
now,
the
record
goes
on
to
show
that
the
defense
attorney
made
no
objection
to
this
statement.
he
was
only
asking
the
court
to
define
what
type
of
damages
would
be
returnable
by
the
jury
and
what
findings
the
jury
would
have.
now,
in
this
connection,
i
would
like
to
also
point
out
that
we
have
a
very
little
statutory
law
in
florida
relative
to
the
trial
of
a
libel
action.
the
statute
in
florida
only
has
to
the
--
directed
to
the
award
of
punitive
damages
and
provides
that
if
a
retraction
is
printed
of
the
same
size,
type
and
general
location
in
the
newspaper,
punitive
damages
will
not
be
awarded
and
the
jury
was
so
instructed.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
were
instructed
twice
as
shown
bu
the
record.
however,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
there's
more
to
this
case
as
shown
by
the
record,
although
we
did
try
it
on
the
question
of
damages
only
and
i
refer
the
court
to
page
75
of
the
appendix,
relative
to
the
testimony
of
mr.
fred
myer
who
was
the
area
editor
and
in
his
testimony
starting
about
a
half
way
down
the
page,
in
answer
to
a
question,
“now,
at
the
best
of
your
recollection
now
what
word
did
she
actually
used
when
she
called
in.
mr.
myer,
“oh,
the
only
word
i
caught
was
damron
and
i
automatically
put
on
leonard.”
“why
did
you
do
that?”
“he
was
the
only
damron
i
knew.
it
was
probably
a
minimal
abrasion.
i
just
assumed
that
it
was
leonard
damron.
i
didn't
hear
leonard
on
the
phone.
i
can't
swear
that
i
did.
i
just
heard
the
word
damron.”
and
the
next
to
the
last
question
on
the
page
and
in
his
capacity
as
mayor
of
crystal
river,
he
had
been
writing
articles
about
leonard
damron.
we
turn
over
to
page
76
and
here's
where
the
unusual
part
of
this
case
begins.
starting
on
the
middle
of
the
page,
question,
“well,
tell
me
mr.
myer,
having
written
as
many
stories
about
mr.
leonard
damron,”
this
is
on
cross
examination
incidentally,
“weren't
you
aware
that
mr.
damron
was
in
crystal
river?”
answer,
“yes.”
“mr.
myer,
would
you
look
at
the
dateline
on
the
story
which
was
published
in
error
and
answer
me
what
is
the
dateline
in
that
particular
story?”
answer,
“inglis.”
next
question,
“you
had
a
mental
aberration?”
question,
“a
man,
you
have
been
writing
stories
about
in
crystal
river,
florida
and
you
suddenly
give
a
story
about
him
in
inglis,
florida
and
you
make
this
change
without
checking.
what
happened?”
“it
so
happened
i
did”
and
his
next
statement
was
“you'd
spend
37
years
in
the
newspaper
business.”
i
refer
the
court
now
to
page
70
of
the
appendix,
which
is
the
testimony
of
ms.
lucy
weir
who
was
the
reporter
who
called
in
the
story.
on
page
70,
she
reads
into
the
record
the
first
story
that
was
printed
about
james
damron
in
january
of
1966
which
is
substantially
correct.
starting
on
page
72,
that
story
incidentally
is
reprinted
in
part
as
appendix
as
on
85,
it
was
attached.
now,
here's
where
the
--
we
really
get
to
the
reckless
disregard
and
the
malice
in
this
case.
on
page
72,
second
question.
this
has
been
received
in
evidence
as
defendant's
exhibit
number
three
referring
to
the
prior
story.
now,
what
procedure,
talking
to
lucy
weir,
“what
procedure
do
you
follow
in
writing
a
story
and
transmitting
it
to
the
star-banner,
ms.
weir?”
answer,
“well,
i
use
one
of
two
procedures.
if
the
story
is
not
of
particular
news
interest,
i
generally
type
it
and
mail
it
in
since
the
mail
service
is
one
day.
if
the
story
is
of
a
particular
news
value,
i'll
phone
it
in
early
in
the
morning.”
question,
“alright,
what
procedure
did
you
follow
in
transmitting
the
particular
story,
“damron
cased
passed
over
in
next
u.s.
term,”
this
is
the
article
sued
upon.
“what
procedure
did
you
follow
in
transmitting
that
story
to
the
star-banner
for
publication?”
answer,
“i
typed
it
first
at
home.
i
read
it
over
the
phone
the
following
morning,
the
same
morning
to
mr.
myer.”
next
question,
“and
what
is
this?
what
is
the
story?”
answer,
“the
story
is
essentially
the
one
that
i
called
in,
the
only
change
being
that
the
city
was
changed,”
referring
to
the
dateline
gainesville
where
the
federal
court
was
sitting.
and
she
fills
on
to
state,
“when
i
phoned
in
that
morning,
i
had
a
gainesville
dateline
which
was
where
the
action
had
occurred.
i
was
informed
that
our
editor
had
given
instructions
that
any
story
appearing
on
this
page
was
an
area
page
and
should
have
and
coming
out
of
the
area
concerning
the
area
of
people,
should
have
a
dateline
of
the
city
that
the
people
were
concerned
with
because
people
read
datelines
rather
than
the
text
of
the
story.
question,
“who
did
you
telephoned
it
to?”
answer,
“fred
myer.”
now,
it
doesn't
take
a
great
deal
of
logic
for
a
man
to
understand
when
fred
myers
said
he
had
a
mental
aberration
that
this
was
not
a
true
statement.
the
details
shown
in
lucy
weir
a
discussion
of
how
that
story
went
to
the
newspaper.
first
of
all,
this
was
actually
a
reprint
of
a
prior
story.
the
standing
of
the
prior
story
is
shown
by
the
make
up
in
the
appendix
on
pages
84
and
85
for
comparison.
on
85
is
a
first
story,
on
84
is
a
story
complained
of.
we
go
back
to
lucy
weir,
she
says
that
she
found
out
about
this
story,
typed
it
up
that
night
and
for
some
reason,
unexplained,
she
called
it
in
the
next
day.
but
in
her
conversation,
we
got
--
they
got
into
a
big
discussion
about
the
dateline,
a
story
being
changed
from
gainesville
admittedly
by
mr.
myer
that
this
city
was
changed
from
gainesville
to
inglis.
he
had
written
many
stories
about
the
plaintiff
who
lived
in
crystal
river,
was
the
mayor
of
crystal
river
and
he
knew
was
in
crystal
river.
as
i
say,
this
whole
text
of
this
testimony
shows
conclusively
when
you
refer
back
to
the
testimony
of
the
plaintiff
on
page
30
of
the
appendix,
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
this
was
a
testimony
of
the
plaintiff
put
on
in
chief.
“mr.
damron,
have
you
ever
had
in
the
case,
called
ocala
star-banner
regarding
this
news
publication?”
answer,
“yes,
i've
called
the
ocala
star-banner.”
question,
“when
did
you
call
them?”
answer,
“back
somewhere
in
1965,
i
believe
it
was
about
october,
if
i
am
not
mistaken.”
question,
“who
did
you
talk
with?”
answer,
“i
talked
to
mr.
louis
phillips.”
question,
“do
you
know
who
mr.
phillips
is?”
answer,
“yes
sir.”
question,
“or
was
at
that
time?”
answer,
“yes,
sir.
he
was
the
vice
president
publisher
and
that's
the
one
i
asked
to
speak
to
and
i
asked
to
speak
to
the
general
manager,
mr.
dunn,
and
they
got
me
on
the
phone
and
got
him
on
the
phone.”
question,
“what
was
the
substance
of
your
conversation
with
mr.
phillips?”
answer,
“i
asked
him
to
send
someone
to
crystal
river
to
publish
a
news
as
it
happened,
true
facts
and
not
editorial
on
the
subject
they
write
on.”
question,
“what
prompted
you
to
call
the
ocala
star-banner?”
answer,
“so,
many
mistakes
in
the
paper.”
the
newspaper
publisher
had
been
informed
that
his
publications
were
coming
out
erroneously.
this
is
the
--
this
as
i
see
is
a
classic
case.
based
on
the
evidence
in
the
record,
we
have
to
go
no
further
than
to
that,
to
show
that
it
was
malice
in
the
publication
of
this
story
timely
in
the
middle
of
an
election,
unlike
a
story
which
the
evidence
also
shows
was
at
the
passing
over
part
occurred
13
days
before
the
news
story
was
broken.
it
was
a
re-publication
of
a
prior
composition
of
the
same
newspaper,
published
timely
right
in
the
middle
of
an
election.
mr.
wallace
dunn
what
happened
on
the
--
mr.
wallace
dunn
it
affirmed
on
that
basis
because
that
was
the
point
presented
by
the
appellant
at
that
time.
mr.
wallace
dunn
the
florida
case
was
appealed
to
the
florida
supreme
court.
they
reviewed
the
decision
and
dismissed
it
of
their
own
motion.
mr.
wallace
dunn
that
is
correct,
yes
sir
--
mr.
wallace
dunn
--
based
on
the
--
mr.
wallace
dunn
i'm
saying
three
things
your
honor.
first,
the
defendants
admitted
their
liability
before
we
ever
tried
this
case
at
a
time
when
the
decisions
of
this
court
were
well-known
and
well-available
to
them
to
make
any
objection
as
to
this
rule
at
the
time
of
trial.
mr.
wallace
dunn
yes,
sir.
mr.
wallace
dunn
yes,
sir.
the
jury
then
and
as
pointed
out
earlier
also
chief
justice
burger,
we
have
this
florida
statute
that
prohibits
the
award
of
punitive
damages
unless
if
the
publication
has
been
retracted
and
the
jury
made
this
determination
that
it
was
properly
retracted.
mr.
wallace
dunn
yes,
sir.
mr.
wallace
dunn
that's
the
only
matter
of
record,
yes.
mr.
wallace
dunn
no
sir.
we
went
strictly
on
the
issue
of
damages
and
the
perpetration
of
the
instructions.
mr.
wallace
dunn
we
neither
went
into
a
discussion
of
the
type
of
damages
to
be
awarded.
mr.
wallace
dunn
we
have
it
right
here
and
i'll
be
very
happy
to
supplement
it
your
honor.
mr.
wallace
dunn
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
explain
sir.
at
the
time
this
case
went
to
the
district
court,
the
only
point
that
was
urged
on
the
district
court
was
new
york
times
versus
sullivan.
mr.
wallace
dunn
and
the
argument
at
that
point
was
that
the
libel
complained
of
was
a
perjury
charge
unconnected
with
any
office
sought
or
held,
that
it
was
not
within
the
purview
official
conduct.
mr.
wallace
dunn
your
honor,
i
mean
mr.
justice
white,
i'm
sorry
i
cannot
read
into
the
minds
of
why
the
judge
wrote
that
opinion
they
did,
but
it's
obvious
because
the
way
in
which
they
went
over
the
directed
verdict
aspect
of
it,
they
didn't
even
get
consideration
--
mr.
wallace
dunn
i
brought
this
point
up
in
my
reply
for
the
petition
of
certiorari.
mr.
wallace
dunn
15
days.
mr.
wallace
dunn
yes,
sir.
mr.
wallace
dunn
the
evidence
that
went
into
the
trial
and
i
might
point
out
this
point,
all
the
several
--
there
was
two
offices.
he
held
the
office
of
mayor
at
the
time
of
this
election
that
we're
speaking
of.
he
was
running
for
the
office
of
tax
assessor.
mr.
wallace
dunn
in
the
county,
yes
sir.
mr.
wallace
dunn
i
believe
the
ballot
as
returned
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
is
12,000
as
i
recall.
mr.
wallace
dunn
and
he
ran
for
a
third
--
mr.
wallace
dunn
the
area
of
citrus
county?
mr.
wallace
dunn
he
ran
a
very
poor
third
because
the
circulation
of
the
retraction
was
so
poor.
although,
he
went
on
himself
and
tried
every
way
he
could.
we
didn't
have
television
down
there
or
radio
stations.
mr.
wallace
dunn
well,
in
this
particular
county
politics
gets
really
hot
down
there
in
that
particular
county,
mr.
justice
and
--
mr.
wallace
dunn
civil
rights
case
is
passé
in
this
thing
and
the
only
reference
to
civil
rights
we
had
in
this
thing
was
the
original
case
that
the
brother
james
damron
was
a
witness
in.
it's
totally
remote
to
anything
involved
here.
mr.
wallace
dunn
it
would
seem
so.
the
communications
are
very
poor
in
that
county
and
politics
was
well
fought.
mr.
wallace
dunn
the
record
didn't
show
this.
mr.
wallace
dunn
the
record
did
not
show
this.
he
had
an
off
and
everybody
went
down
on
this
man
immediately
when
this
publication
came
up.
this
is
a
well
read
newspaper
in
this
particular
county
although
it
was
not
published
in
that
county.
mr.
wallace
dunn
the
record
shows
that
the
retraction
was
printed
in
the
lower
right
hand
corner,
a
very
small
headline.
this
was
one
of
the
issues
in
the
trial
as
to
whether
the
headlines
constituted
a
ground
for
having
punitive
damages
and
the
jury
held
not.
mr.
wallace
dunn
they
did,
he
tried
everything
he
could.
and
as
pointed
out
--
mr.
wallace
dunn
there
was
a
retraction
published
the
following
day.
there
was
a
letter
that
mr.
damron
wrote
to
the
star-banner
which
was
published
in
the
letters
to
editor,
which
also
would
have
shown
a
retraction
and
then
there
was
a
commentary
letter
by
one
of
his
friends
that
was
written.
mr.
wallace
dunn
this
is
true
sir.
mr.
wallace
dunn
not
only
did
he
lose
this
but
he
also
lost
his
manorial
job
which
more
or
less
an
honorary
position,
but
he
lost
it
in
the
next
election
which
was
held
on
an
that
basis.
mr.
wallace
dunn
four
times,
i
believe
sir.
mr.
wallace
dunn
i
can
only
go
for
the
record
and
the
indication
was
that
it
was
very
detrimental
to
him.
mr.
wallace
dunn
he
sure
did.[attempt
to
laughter]
mr.
wallace
dunn
it's
not
in
the
record
and
i
don't
like
to
go
outside
the
record
but
i
will
–
i
will
say
this
--
mr.
wallace
dunn
the
jury's
verdict
does
speak
for
itself
but
for
one
of
my
opponents
closing
argument,
we
both
used
the
analogy
to
the
jury,
you
can't
look
in
a
crystal
ball
until
whether
this
man
would
ever
won
this
election
and
we
both
argued
this
point
of
the
jury
and
i
think
the
jury
did
not.
this
is
only
an
opinion
on
my
part
could
have
considered
because
we
both
hammered
it
home
and
this
is
a
--
it
would
be
a
strictly
a
conjectural
damages,
there's
no
question
about
it.
mr.
wallace
dunn
yes
sir.
mr.
wallace
dunn
yes,
sir.
mr.
wallace
dunn
yes,
sir.
mr.
wallace
dunn
right.
mr.
wallace
dunn
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
wallace
dunn
the
format
of
the
art
--
of
discussion
with
the
court
at
this
particular
point
was
whether
the
court
was
going
to
tell
the
jury
and
i
believe
this
is
what
mr.
aires
was
after.
you
get
to
return
a
verdict
even
if
it's
only
for
one
dollar
and
the
court
said,
no,
i'm
going
to
tell
the
jury
that
you
have
admitted
liability,
but
whether
they
bring
in
any
damages
is
strictly
within
their
own
prerogative.
mr.
wallace
dunn
he
told
the
jury
that
he
had
directed
a
verdict
for
the
plaintiff.
mr.
wallace
dunn
it's
not
in
the
instructions.
i
believe
that
are
in
the
appendix.
mr.
wallace
dunn
yes,
sir.
mr.
wallace
dunn
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
wallace
dunn
yes
sir.
as
i
take
it,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
would
like
me
to
have
a
transcript
here.
mr.
wallace
dunn
i
have
copy
here.
yes,
sir,
with
me.
mr.
wallace
dunn
alright
sir.
mr.
wallace
dunn
yes
sir.
mr.
wallace
dunn
yes
sir.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
wallace
dunn
well,
i
cannot
answer
the
question.
mr.
wallace
dunn
yes,
sir.
i
did.
mr.
wallace
dunn
no,
sir.
it
was
not.
mr.
wallace
dunn
yes,
sir,
i
did
not.
mr.
wallace
dunn
it's
correct.
mr.
wallace
dunn
yes,
it's
correct.
mr.
wallace
dunn
the
reason
the
position
wasn't
taken,
we
went
out
in
the
left
field
of
a
ball
park
about
that
time
and
got
off
on
new
york
times
versus
sullivan
and
it
was
at
foreign
language
to
me
at
that
time
and
i
was
taking
the
position
at
that
time
that
he
was
trying
to
say,
yes,
maybe
we
admitted
liability,
but
we
feel
that
these
are
the
keys
as
governs,
that's
attack
it
to
him.
mr.
wallace
dunn
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
members
of
the
court.
a
rebuttal
to
mr.
wahl's
comments
--
mr.
wallace
dunn
yes,
sir.
i
like
to
point
out
some
various
salient
features
in
this
case.
i
will
concur
with
mr.
wahl
on
one
thing,
it
is
an
unusual
case.
the
original
complaint,
and
i
filed
the
original
complaint,
was
filed
in
1966,
but
this
case
was
not
tried
until
january
1968.
as
pointed
out
in
my
brief,
just
prior
to
the
trial
of
this
case,
the
trial
attorney
admitted
liability
on
behalf
of
the
defendants
and
we
tried
this
case
strictly
on
the
question
of
damages.
however,
in
working
--
mr.
wallace
dunn
yes,
this
is
quite
correct.
and
this
is
the
reason
for
the
--
mr.
wallace
dunn
sir?
mr.
wallace
dunn
the
fact
--
the
only
place
in
the
record
that
you
can
--
that
has
a
direct
reference
to
it,
sir,
is
the
comment
of
the
judge
at
the
time
he
directed
the
verdict.
in
other
words
--
mr.
wallace
dunn
it's
on
page
80
of
the
appendix,
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
mr.
wallace
dunn
yes,
sir.
i
had
made
my
application
for
a
directed
verdict
at
the
conclusion
of
the
evidence
and
the
court
at
the
point
of
discussion
pointed
out
why
i
think
liability
as
to
compensatory
damages
is
admitted
in
this
case,
not
proven
that
the
word
admitted
was
used
and
this
is
exactly
what
happened
and
that
is
a
reason
for
the
candor
in
which
this
was
tried.
now,
the
record
goes
on
to
show
that
the
defense
attorney
made
no
objection
to
this
statement.
he
was
only
asking
the
court
to
define
what
type
of
damages
would
be
returnable
by
the
jury
and
what
findings
the
jury
would
have.
now,
in
this
connection,
i
would
like
to
also
point
out
that
we
have
a
very
little
statutory
law
in
florida
relative
to
the
trial
of
a
libel
action.
the
statute
in
florida
only
has
to
the
--
directed
to
the
award
of
punitive
damages
and
provides
that
if
a
retraction
is
printed
of
the
same
size,
type
and
general
location
in
the
newspaper,
punitive
damages
will
not
be
awarded
and
the
jury
was
so
instructed.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
were
instructed
twice
as
shown
bu
the
record.
however,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
there's
more
to
this
case
as
shown
by
the
record,
although
we
did
try
it
on
the
question
of
damages
only
and
i
refer
the
court
to
page
75
of
the
appendix,
relative
to
the
testimony
of
mr.
fred
myer
who
was
the
area
editor
and
in
his
testimony
starting
about
a
half
way
down
the
page,
in
answer
to
a
question,
“now,
at
the
best
of
your
recollection
now
what
word
did
she
actually
used
when
she
called
in.
mr.
myer,
“oh,
the
only
word
i
caught
was
damron
and
i
automatically
put
on
leonard.”
“why
did
you
do
that?”
“he
was
the
only
damron
i
knew.
it
was
probably
a
minimal
abrasion.
i
just
assumed
that
it
was
leonard
damron.
i
didn't
hear
leonard
on
the
phone.
i
can't
swear
that
i
did.
i
just
heard
the
word
damron.”
and
the
next
to
the
last
question
on
the
page
and
in
his
capacity
as
mayor
of
crystal
river,
he
had
been
writing
articles
about
leonard
damron.
we
turn
over
to
page
76
and
here's
where
the
unusual
part
of
this
case
begins.
starting
on
the
middle
of
the
page,
question,
“well,
tell
me
mr.
myer,
having
written
as
many
stories
about
mr.
leonard
damron,”
this
is
on
cross
examination
incidentally,
“weren't
you
aware
that
mr.
damron
was
in
crystal
river?”
answer,
“yes.”
“mr.
myer,
would
you
look
at
the
dateline
on
the
story
which
was
published
in
error
and
answer
me
what
is
the
dateline
in
that
particular
story?”
answer,
“inglis.”
next
question,
“you
had
a
mental
aberration?”
question,
“a
man,
you
have
been
writing
stories
about
in
crystal
river,
florida
and
you
suddenly
give
a
story
about
him
in
inglis,
florida
and
you
make
this
change
without
checking.
what
happened?”
“it
so
happened
i
did”
and
his
next
statement
was
“you'd
spend
37
years
in
the
newspaper
business.”
i
refer
the
court
now
to
page
70
of
the
appendix,
which
is
the
testimony
of
ms.
lucy
weir
who
was
the
reporter
who
called
in
the
story.
on
page
70,
she
reads
into
the
record
the
first
story
that
was
printed
about
james
damron
in
january
of
1966
which
is
substantially
correct.
starting
on
page
72,
that
story
incidentally
is
reprinted
in
part
as
appendix
as
on
85,
it
was
attached.
now,
here's
where
the
--
we
really
get
to
the
reckless
disregard
and
the
malice
in
this
case.
on
page
72,
second
question.
this
has
been
received
in
evidence
as
defendant's
exhibit
number
three
referring
to
the
prior
story.
now,
what
procedure,
talking
to
lucy
weir,
“what
procedure
do
you
follow
in
writing
a
story
and
transmitting
it
to
the
star-banner,
ms.
weir?”
answer,
“well,
i
use
one
of
two
procedures.
if
the
story
is
not
of
particular
news
interest,
i
generally
type
it
and
mail
it
in
since
the
mail
service
is
one
day.
if
the
story
is
of
a
particular
news
value,
i'll
phone
it
in
early
in
the
morning.”
question,
“alright,
what
procedure
did
you
follow
in
transmitting
the
particular
story,
“damron
cased
passed
over
in
next
u.s.
term,”
this
is
the
article
sued
upon.
“what
procedure
did
you
follow
in
transmitting
that
story
to
the
star-banner
for
publication?”
answer,
“i
typed
it
first
at
home.
i
read
it
over
the
phone
the
following
morning,
the
same
morning
to
mr.
myer.”
next
question,
“and
what
is
this?
what
is
the
story?”
answer,
“the
story
is
essentially
the
one
that
i
called
in,
the
only
change
being
that
the
city
was
changed,”
referring
to
the
dateline
gainesville
where
the
federal
court
was
sitting.
and
she
fills
on
to
state,
“when
i
phoned
in
that
morning,
i
had
a
gainesville
dateline
which
was
where
the
action
had
occurred.
i
was
informed
that
our
editor
had
given
instructions
that
any
story
appearing
on
this
page
was
an
area
page
and
should
have
and
coming
out
of
the
area
concerning
the
area
of
people,
should
have
a
dateline
of
the
city
that
the
people
were
concerned
with
because
people
read
datelines
rather
than
the
text
of
the
story.
question,
“who
did
you
telephoned
it
to?”
answer,
“fred
myer.”
now,
it
doesn't
take
a
great
deal
of
logic
for
a
man
to
understand
when
fred
myers
said
he
had
a
mental
aberration
that
this
was
not
a
true
statement.
the
details
shown
in
lucy
weir
a
discussion
of
how
that
story
went
to
the
newspaper.
first
of
all,
this
was
actually
a
reprint
of
a
prior
story.
the
standing
of
the
prior
story
is
shown
by
the
make
up
in
the
appendix
on
pages
84
and
85
for
comparison.
on
85
is
a
first
story,
on
84
is
a
story
complained
of.
we
go
back
to
lucy
weir,
she
says
that
she
found
out
about
this
story,
typed
it
up
that
night
and
for
some
reason,
unexplained,
she
called
it
in
the
next
day.
but
in
her
conversation,
we
got
--
they
got
into
a
big
discussion
about
the
dateline,
a
story
being
changed
from
gainesville
admittedly
by
mr.
myer
that
this
city
was
changed
from
gainesville
to
inglis.
he
had
written
many
stories
about
the
plaintiff
who
lived
in
crystal
river,
was
the
mayor
of
crystal
river
and
he
knew
was
in
crystal
river.
as
i
say,
this
whole
text
of
this
testimony
shows
conclusively
when
you
refer
back
to
the
testimony
of
the
plaintiff
on
page
30
of
the
appendix,
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
this
was
a
testimony
of
the
plaintiff
put
on
in
chief.
“mr.
damron,
have
you
ever
had
in
the
case,
called
ocala
star-banner
regarding
this
news
publication?”
answer,
“yes,
i've
called
the
ocala
star-banner.”
question,
“when
did
you
call
them?”
answer,
“back
somewhere
in
1965,
i
believe
it
was
about
october,
if
i
am
not
mistaken.”
question,
“who
did
you
talk
with?”
answer,
“i
talked
to
mr.
louis
phillips.”
question,
“do
you
know
who
mr.
phillips
is?”
answer,
“yes
sir.”
question,
“or
was
at
that
time?”
answer,
“yes,
sir.
he
was
the
vice
president
publisher
and
that's
the
one
i
asked
to
speak
to
and
i
asked
to
speak
to
the
general
manager,
mr.
dunn,
and
they
got
me
on
the
phone
and
got
him
on
the
phone.”
question,
“what
was
the
substance
of
your
conversation
with
mr.
phillips?”
answer,
“i
asked
him
to
send
someone
to
crystal
river
to
publish
a
news
as
it
happened,
true
facts
and
not
editorial
on
the
subject
they
write
on.”
question,
“what
prompted
you
to
call
the
ocala
star-banner?”
answer,
“so,
many
mistakes
in
the
paper.”
the
newspaper
publisher
had
been
informed
that
his
publications
were
coming
out
erroneously.
this
is
the
--
this
as
i
see
is
a
classic
case.
based
on
the
evidence
in
the
record,
we
have
to
go
no
further
than
to
that,
to
show
that
it
was
malice
in
the
publication
of
this
story
timely
in
the
middle
of
an
election,
unlike
a
story
which
the
evidence
also
shows
was
at
the
passing
over
part
occurred
13
days
before
the
news
story
was
broken.
it
was
a
re-publication
of
a
prior
composition
of
the
same
newspaper,
published
timely
right
in
the
middle
of
an
election.
mr.
wallace
dunn
what
happened
on
the
--
mr.
wallace
dunn
it
affirmed
on
that
basis
because
that
was
the
point
presented
by
the
appellant
at
that
time.
mr.
wallace
dunn
the
florida
case
was
appealed
to
the
florida
supreme
court.
they
reviewed
the
decision
and
dismissed
it
of
their
own
motion.
mr.
wallace
dunn
that
is
correct,
yes
sir
--
mr.
wallace
dunn
--
based
on
the
--
mr.
wallace
dunn
i'm
saying
three
things
your
honor.
first,
the
defendants
admitted
their
liability
before
we
ever
tried
this
case
at
a
time
when
the
decisions
of
this
court
were
well-known
and
well-available
to
them
to
make
any
objection
as
to
this
rule
at
the
time
of
trial.
mr.
wallace
dunn
yes,
sir.
mr.
wallace
dunn
yes,
sir.
the
jury
then
and
as
pointed
out
earlier
also
chief
justice
burger,
we
have
this
florida
statute
that
prohibits
the
award
of
punitive
damages
unless
if
the
publication
has
been
retracted
and
the
jury
made
this
determination
that
it
was
properly
retracted.
mr.
wallace
dunn
yes,
sir.
mr.
wallace
dunn
that's
the
only
matter
of
record,
yes.
mr.
wallace
dunn
no
sir.
we
went
strictly
on
the
issue
of
damages
and
the
perpetration
of
the
instructions.
mr.
wallace
dunn
we
neither
went
into
a
discussion
of
the
type
of
damages
to
be
awarded.
mr.
wallace
dunn
we
have
it
right
here
and
i'll
be
very
happy
to
supplement
it
your
honor.
mr.
wallace
dunn
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
explain
sir.
at
the
time
this
case
went
to
the
district
court,
the
only
point
that
was
urged
on
the
district
court
was
new
york
times
versus
sullivan.
mr.
wallace
dunn
and
the
argument
at
that
point
was
that
the
libel
complained
of
was
a
perjury
charge
unconnected
with
any
office
sought
or
held,
that
it
was
not
within
the
purview
official
conduct.
mr.
wallace
dunn
your
honor,
i
mean
mr.
justice
white,
i'm
sorry
i
cannot
read
into
the
minds
of
why
the
judge
wrote
that
opinion
they
did,
but
it's
obvious
because
the
way
in
which
they
went
over
the
directed
verdict
aspect
of
it,
they
didn't
even
get
consideration
--
mr.
wallace
dunn
i
brought
this
point
up
in
my
reply
for
the
petition
of
certiorari.
mr.
wallace
dunn
15
days.
mr.
wallace
dunn
yes,
sir.
mr.
wallace
dunn
the
evidence
that
went
into
the
trial
and
i
might
point
out
this
point,
all
the
several
--
there
was
two
offices.
he
held
the
office
of
mayor
at
the
time
of
this
election
that
we're
speaking
of.
he
was
running
for
the
office
of
tax
assessor.
mr.
wallace
dunn
in
the
county,
yes
sir.
mr.
wallace
dunn
i
believe
the
ballot
as
returned
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
is
12,000
as
i
recall.
mr.
wallace
dunn
and
he
ran
for
a
third
--
mr.
wallace
dunn
the
area
of
citrus
county?
mr.
wallace
dunn
he
ran
a
very
poor
third
because
the
circulation
of
the
retraction
was
so
poor.
although,
he
went
on
himself
and
tried
every
way
he
could.
we
didn't
have
television
down
there
or
radio
stations.
mr.
wallace
dunn
well,
in
this
particular
county
politics
gets
really
hot
down
there
in
that
particular
county,
mr.
justice
and
--
mr.
wallace
dunn
civil
rights
case
is
passé
in
this
thing
and
the
only
reference
to
civil
rights
we
had
in
this
thing
was
the
original
case
that
the
brother
james
damron
was
a
witness
in.
it's
totally
remote
to
anything
involved
here.
mr.
wallace
dunn
it
would
seem
so.
the
communications
are
very
poor
in
that
county
and
politics
was
well
fought.
mr.
wallace
dunn
the
record
didn't
show
this.
mr.
wallace
dunn
the
record
did
not
show
this.
he
had
an
off
and
everybody
went
down
on
this
man
immediately
when
this
publication
came
up.
this
is
a
well
read
newspaper
in
this
particular
county
although
it
was
not
published
in
that
county.
mr.
wallace
dunn
the
record
shows
that
the
retraction
was
printed
in
the
lower
right
hand
corner,
a
very
small
headline.
this
was
one
of
the
issues
in
the
trial
as
to
whether
the
headlines
constituted
a
ground
for
having
punitive
damages
and
the
jury
held
not.
mr.
wallace
dunn
they
did,
he
tried
everything
he
could.
and
as
pointed
out
--
mr.
wallace
dunn
there
was
a
retraction
published
the
following
day.
there
was
a
letter
that
mr.
damron
wrote
to
the
star-banner
which
was
published
in
the
letters
to
editor,
which
also
would
have
shown
a
retraction
and
then
there
was
a
commentary
letter
by
one
of
his
friends
that
was
written.
mr.
wallace
dunn
this
is
true
sir.
mr.
wallace
dunn
not
only
did
he
lose
this
but
he
also
lost
his
manorial
job
which
more
or
less
an
honorary
position,
but
he
lost
it
in
the
next
election
which
was
held
on
an
that
basis.
mr.
wallace
dunn
four
times,
i
believe
sir.
mr.
wallace
dunn
i
can
only
go
for
the
record
and
the
indication
was
that
it
was
very
detrimental
to
him.
mr.
wallace
dunn
he
sure
did.[attempt
to
laughter]
mr.
wallace
dunn
it's
not
in
the
record
and
i
don't
like
to
go
outside
the
record
but
i
will
–
i
will
say
this
--
mr.
wallace
dunn
the
jury's
verdict
does
speak
for
itself
but
for
one
of
my
opponents
closing
argument,
we
both
used
the
analogy
to
the
jury,
you
can't
look
in
a
crystal
ball
until
whether
this
man
would
ever
won
this
election
and
we
both
argued
this
point
of
the
jury
and
i
think
the
jury
did
not.
this
is
only
an
opinion
on
my
part
could
have
considered
because
we
both
hammered
it
home
and
this
is
a
--
it
would
be
a
strictly
a
conjectural
damages,
there's
no
question
about
it.
mr.
wallace
dunn
yes
sir.
mr.
wallace
dunn
yes,
sir.
mr.
wallace
dunn
yes,
sir.
mr.
wallace
dunn
right.
mr.
wallace
dunn
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
wallace
dunn
the
format
of
the
art
--
of
discussion
with
the
court
at
this
particular
point
was
whether
the
court
was
going
to
tell
the
jury
and
i
believe
this
is
what
mr.
aires
was
after.
you
get
to
return
a
verdict
even
if
it's
only
for
one
dollar
and
the
court
said,
no,
i'm
going
to
tell
the
jury
that
you
have
admitted
liability,
but
whether
they
bring
in
any
damages
is
strictly
within
their
own
prerogative.
mr.
wallace
dunn
he
told
the
jury
that
he
had
directed
a
verdict
for
the
plaintiff.
mr.
wallace
dunn
it's
not
in
the
instructions.
i
believe
that
are
in
the
appendix.
mr.
wallace
dunn
yes,
sir.
mr.
wallace
dunn
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
wallace
dunn
yes
sir.
as
i
take
it,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
would
like
me
to
have
a
transcript
here.
mr.
wallace
dunn
i
have
copy
here.
yes,
sir,
with
me.
mr.
wallace
dunn
alright
sir.
mr.
wallace
dunn
yes
sir.
mr.
wallace
dunn
yes
sir.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
wallace
dunn
well,
i
cannot
answer
the
question.
mr.
wallace
dunn
yes,
sir.
i
did.
mr.
wallace
dunn
no,
sir.
it
was
not.
mr.
wallace
dunn
yes,
sir,
i
did
not.
mr.
wallace
dunn
it's
correct.
mr.
wallace
dunn
yes,
it's
correct.
mr.
wallace
dunn
the
reason
the
position
wasn't
taken,
we
went
out
in
the
left
field
of
a
ball
park
about
that
time
and
got
off
on
new
york
times
versus
sullivan
and
it
was
at
foreign
language
to
me
at
that
time
and
i
was
taking
the
position
at
that
time
that
he
was
trying
to
say,
yes,
maybe
we
admitted
liability,
but
we
feel
that
these
are
the
keys
as
governs,
that's
attack
it
to
him.
