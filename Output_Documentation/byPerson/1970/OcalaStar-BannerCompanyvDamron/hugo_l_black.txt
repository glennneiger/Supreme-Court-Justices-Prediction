how
long
was
it
exactly
after
this
article
was
published
before
the
election
took
place?
justice
hugo

15
days.
justice

black
now,
which
is
it,
which
office
was
it
he
claimed
that
he
was
defeated
on
account
of
that
article?
justice
hugo

in

how
many
voters
are
there?

how
big,
i
mean
--
justice
hugo

black
how
big
is
the

area?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
the
county,
his
running
in.
i'm
asking
because
frankly
i
can't
understand
myself,
how
it
could
be
possible
for
a
man
to
have
a
charge
like
a
mayor
and
then
recall,
admitted
that
it
was
wrong
and
then
failed
to
win?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
seems
a
serious
thing
to
me
down
in
florida?
justice
hugo
l.
black
didn't
the
judge
have
any
civil
rights
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
know
a
little
bit
campaigns
and
i
just
couldn't
imagine
how
a
man
would
ever
a
think
like
that
said
about
him
and
prove
it
wasn't
true
and
then
went
overwhelming
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
a
candidate
can
get
things
out
very
quickly
if
he
has
to
by
searching
for
anything.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what?
justice
hugo

black
but
you
would
read
later
too
if
it
was
read
the
first
time,
why
wouldn't
it
be
read
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
he
published
it
in
the
lower
right
hand
corner,
the
smaller
headline,
why
didn't
they
go
them
and
complain
again,
and
insist
he
publish
it
differently.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
publish
--
how
many
times
did
he
published?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
don't
know
that
that
governs
but
i
have
just
seen
those
things
kick
back
on
people
so
often
when
they
make
charges
that
are
not
true?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
strange
to
me
that
it
didn't
help
him
instead
of
hurting
him?
justice

black
how
many
times
has
he
been
elected

before?
justice

maybe
--

don't
see
how
they
could
attribute
[attempt

that
to
