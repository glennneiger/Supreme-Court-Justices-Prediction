justice
byron
r.
white
well,
didn't
somebody
in
the
paper
know
that
this
was
false?
justice
byron
r.
white
knew
it
was
false?
justice
byron
r.
white
everybody
else
on
the
newspaper
knew
it
was
false?
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
your
district
court
of
appeal
affirm
this
judgment
only
on
the
basis
of
new
york
times
that
was
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
it
was
not
applied
--
was
it
not
to
be
applied?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
was
no
further
review
in
the
florida
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
that
we
have
it
coming
here
as
judgment
in
the
florida
court
saying
that
on
these
facts,
new
york
times
--
the
new
york
times
rule
is
inapplicable?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
you're
arguing
here
that
it
is
applicable,
but
it
was
satisfied?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
admitted
their
liability?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
the
only
evidence
of
admitting
liability
and
not
relying
on
new
york
times
that
material
which
you
pointed
out
to
us
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
the
appendix?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
never
was
a
request
for
any
objection
to
judges
instructing
the
jury
on
liability?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
may
be
that
you're
quite
right
that
he
should
have
been
--
that
the
newspaper
should
have
been
precluded
from
raising
this
issue
which
they
haven't
raised
at
trial,
but
the
florida
courts
under
the
florida
procedure
doesn't
seem
to
--
don't
seem
to
have
a
taken
that
course.
the
district
court
of
appeal
has
said
--
has
taken
issue
and
decided
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
if
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
new
york
times
issue
was
out
of
the
case
because
they
admitted,
they
had
admitted
their
liability,
now
why
would
they
--
why
would
the
florida
court
even
deal
with
the
issue?
they
would
say
you
have
waived
the
question,
you've
admitted
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
justice
knew
that
we
shouldn't
reach
this
new
york
times
issue
because
the
newspaper
admitted
that
it
didn't
apply
and
yet
the
case
comes
here
from
the
florida
courts
on
the
assumption,
on
a
wholly
different
assumption?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
still
am
being
puzzled
by
the
acts
of
the
florida
court
of
appeals.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
florida
court
read
the
record
and
certainly
it
should
be
authoritative
on
how
to
read
that
record
for
purposes
of
the
florida
law.
if
florida
court
had
read
the
record
as
indicating
that
the
newspaper
had
admitted
liability
in
the
sense
that
new
york
times
applies
but
we
have
published
maliciously.
why
would
the
florida
court
ever
have
affirmed
on
the
basis,
not
on
that
basis,
but
on
the
basis
of
the
new
york
times
rules
has
no
relevance
to
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the
florida
court
of
appeals
starts
right
out
and
says
it's
contented
here
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
new
york
times
rule
requires
the
proof
of
malice
and
there
wasn't
any
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
have
been
the
normal
florida
rule
or
law
if
a
--
if
on
this
appeal
to
the
district
court
of
appeals
where
your
side
claimed
the
benefit
of
new
york
times,
the
other
side
had
come
back
and
said,
“awfully
sorry,
this
issue
is
not
on
the
case
because
there
were
no
objections
to
the
instructions,
no
request
for
an
instruction
on
new
york
times,
although,
this
case
was
tried
after
new
york
times
and
the
appellant
isn't
entitled
to
have
the
case
reversed
on
the
basis
of
new
york
times.
now,
what
is
the
florida
law
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
the
newspaper
didn't
request
any
instructions
on
new
york
times?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
objected
the
obstructions
based
on
new
york
times?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
florida
law
about
that
in
appellate
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
know
if
the
florida
appellate
court
said
that,
this
issue
is
not
an
issue
on
appeal
because
it
was
not
raised
in
the
trial
court.
i'm
not
so
sure
we
would
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let
me
--
let
me
ask
you
this.
let's
assume
that
we
reversed
and
the
case
went
back
to
the
florida
district
court
of
appeals.
would
the
issue
still
be
open
as
to
whether
the
new
york
times
question
had
been
waived
in
the
trial
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
you
forgot
to
raise
something
in
the
trial
court,
you
raised
it
in
the
appellate
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
puts
the
issue
in
the
case,
you
think?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
didn't
somebody
in
the
paper
know
that

was
