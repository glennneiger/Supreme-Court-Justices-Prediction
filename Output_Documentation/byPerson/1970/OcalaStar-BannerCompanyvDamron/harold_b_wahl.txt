mr.
harold
b.
wahl
mr.
chief
justice,
gentlemen
of
the
court.
this
is
a
right
interesting
libel
case.
the
trial
judge
actually
directed
a
verdict
for
the
plaintiff
on
compensatory
damages
and
told
the
jury
that
the
only
question
was
how
many
dollars
they
were
going
to
give
the
plaintiff
on
compensatory
damages?
as
to
punitive
damages,
he
told
the
jury
that
they
can
only
give
those
if
malice
were
proven
and
the
jury
brought
in
no
punitive
acts.
the
attorney
for
the
plaintiff
was
successful
in
urging
upon
the
court
and
the
florida
courts
have
consistently
held,
in
this
case,
that
the
new
york
times
doctrine
and
i
quote
from
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
of
appeal
on
review,
only
applies
“to
official
conduct
of
a
public
official.”
the
time
of
this
case
was
april
1966
at
the
height
of
the
civil
rights
controversy
in
the
south.
the
locale
was
rural
citrus
county,
population
9,268
without
even
a
daily
or
weekly
news
or
semi-weekly
newspaper
of
its
own.
plaintiff
damron
was
a
small
town
politician
and
garage
man.
he
was
mayor
of
the
municipality
of
crystal
river,
population
1,523
and
a
candidate
to
succeed
himself.
he
was
also
practically
a
full-time
candidate
for
county
tax
assessor,
politicking
for
that
job
while
his
brother
james
damron
ran
his
garage.
in
the
middle
of
the
election
campaign
for
county
tax
assessor,
and
of
course,
he
was
continuously
running
for
re-election
as
mayor
and
was
subsequently
defeated.
the
defendant
ocala
star-banner,
the
daily
newspaper
in
a
nearby
marion
county,
ran
the
offending
article.
in
the
article,
it
was
stated,
erroneously,
that
leonard
damron
rather
than
his
brother
had
had
a
case
continued
which
was
an
indictment
for
perjury
in
the
federal
court
in
the
civil
rights
case.
now,
if
there
was
anything
that
was
of
more
public
interest
in
the
rural
south
in
april
1966
than
civil
rights,
it
was
an
indictment
for
perjury
of
a
damron
in
a
civil
rights
case.
now,
the
article
was
written
by
a
man
named
myer,
who
just
recently
come
to
this
position
with
the
ocala
paper.
he
had
never
even
met
the
plaintiff,
but
he
had
written
a
number
of
articles
about
the
political
goings
on
in
crystal
river
where
there
two
factions
and
the
plaintiff
was
the
head
of
one
of
them.
and
when
the
story
was
phoned
in
to
him,
the
reporter
phoned
in
the
correct
name
of
james
damron,
but
the
area
editor
had
heard
so
much
about
and
had
written
so
much
about
this
politician
brother
that
throw
an
error,
he
just
automatically
wrote
down
the
wrong
name
and
that's
how
the
name
of
leonard
got
in
rather
than
james.
leonard
then
brought
a
suit
for
libel
and
he
specifically
alleged
and
i
quote
from
his
complaint
“that
he
was
a
public
officer
being
elected
to
the
office
of
mayor
of
crystal
river
and
a
candidate
for
the
office
of
tax
assessor
of
citrus
county.”
then,
he
charged
that
the
words
of
the
article
imputed
perjury
and
again
i
quote
his
exact
words
“to
the
electorate
of
crystal
river
and
citrus
county.”
he
then
went
on
to
allege
that
the
article
was
published
in
the
middle
of
the
election
campaign
and
cost
him
the
election
and
he
concluded
by
claiming
damages
to
his
reputation
as
a
“public
officer
and
candidate
for
public
office.”
he
didn't
even
alleged
malice
in
his
complaint.
the
word
malice
doesn't
appear
in
it,
even
though
the
court
did
submit
the
issue
of
malice
on
punitive
damages.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
malice
in
a
libel
suit,
yes
sir,
certainly,
under
new
york
times,
you'd
have
to
allege
malice.
the
newspaper
moved
to
dismiss
the
complaint
because
of
the
failure
to
allege
malice
and
moved
to
strike
the
public
figure
damages
where
he
was
claiming
damages
to
him
as
mayor
and
as
candidate
for
public
office.
both
motions
were
denied.
the
case
came
on
for
trial
and
the
court,
as
i
say,
actually
instructed
the
jury
to
bring
in
a
verdict
on
community
--
on
compensatory
damages,
the
only
question
being
the
amount
of
dollars.
plaintiff
testified
that
he
had
been
defeated
for
county
tax
assessor.
he
gave
the
salary
of
the
office.
he
further
testified
that
he
was
defeated
for
re-election
as
mayor.
his
trail
witnesses
repeatedly
testified
as
to
the
effect
that
this
article
had
had
on
his
standing
with
the
electorate
and
that
that
was
what
it
cost
him
the
election.
motion
for
new
trial
and
judgment
non
obstante
veredicto
was
filed.
it
expressly
urged
the
new
york
times
cases,
the
motion
was
denied.
the
florida
district
court
of
appeal
affirmed
on
the
judgment
on
the
directed
verdict,
holding
that
the
new
york
times
doctrine
only
applied
to
“official
conduct
of
a
public
official”
and
that
this
alleged
libel
wasn't
a
libel
that
he
had
done
as
a
public
official.
the
florida
supreme
court
refused
to
review
the
case
and
this
court
has
granted
certiorari.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
and
our
understanding
and
it's
pure
hearsay,
is
that
the
jury
verdict
was
made
of
two-year
salary,
$18,000
and
the
extra
was
a
little
bonus,
that's
where
the
verdict
came
from.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
well,
he
didn't
get
paid
in
that.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
that
was
a
non-paying
job.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
but
the
whole
thrust
of
the
case,
mr.
justice
stewart
was
that
this
article
was
published
right
in
the
middle
of
the
election
campaign,
when
it
was
too
late
for
me
to
do
anything
about
it.
i
am
mayor,
i'm
trying
to
continue
to
be
mayor.
i'm
a
candidate
for
county
tax
assessor
and
this
article
is
what
has
cost
me
the
job.
now,
i
can
say
all
that,
he
said
it.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
well,
it's
all
that
he
did
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
yes,
because
there
isn't
any
question
that
we
made
a
mistake.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
yes,
i
don't
think
there's
--
that
was
his
whole
theory
and
if
you
erroneously
accuse
a
man
of
being
indicted
for
perjury
under
civil
rights
case,
under
rule
of
florida
in
1966,
well
he's
goner,
short
of
being
elected
to
public
office,
there
isn't
any
question
about
that.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
oh,
yes.
he
intermingled
the
two.
he
said
that
he
had
lost
business
in
this
garage
shop
that
his
brother,
the
one
that
was
indicted
was
running
for
him
and
then
of
course,
he
said,
he
felt
bad
and
it
made
him
feel
bad
with
his
neighbors
and
so
forth,
had
been
accused
of
this
thing
and
that
sort
of
thing,
he
brought
that
in.
but
the
real
thrust
of
this
case
was
that
i
have
been
defeated
for
county
tax
assessor
and
i
lost
my
job
as
mayor.
now,
clearly
new
york
times
applies
to
a
situation
of
this
kind
where
the
plaintiff
made
his
own
bet.
i
didn't
try
the
case,
but
the
lawyer
who
tried
the
case
didn't
come
in
and
say
that
he
was
a
public
figure.
the
plaintiff
brought
his
suit
and
specifically
alleged
that
he
was
a
public
figure
that
he
was
the
mayor
running
for
re-election,
that
it
one
stand,
that
he
was
the
candidate
for
tax
assessor,
and
that
he's
been
damaged
as
a
candidate
and
as
mayor.
now,
we
say
under
those
circumstances
that
this
case
should
not
be
sent
back
for
another
trial
to
have
more
expense,
but
that
this
court
should
direct
a
verdict
for
the
newspaper.
now,
he
had
ample
opportunity
in
this
case
to
prove
this
malice
because
he
was
seeking
a
half
million
dollars
in
punitive
damages
in
his
complaint
and
he
brought
in
everything
he
could
on
malice
to
sustain
his
punitive
damages,
so
has
had
a
chance
to
prove
his
malice.
the
only
thing
that
he
showed
on
malice
were
three
innocuous
articles,
written
not
by
the
man
who
wrote
this
story,
but
by
somebody
else
in
the
past
about
him,
one
of
which
said,
that
he
had
walked
out
of
council
meetings
and
he
said,
well,
i
had
differences
to
the
council,
but
i
had
never
physically
walked
out.
another
one
said,
he
had
clashes
with
the
council.
he
said,
well,
i
had
differences
with
them,
but
i
didn't
have
any
clashes
and
the
other
one
he
says
gave
an
erroneous
salary
for
the
city
attorney.
now,
certainly
those
articles
were
not
sufficient
to
establish
malice
and
that's
all
he
has.
as
i
say,
the
man
who
wrote
the
article
made
a
mistake.
there
isn't
any
question.
the
reporter
phoned
it
in
and
she
had
the
right
name,
but
this
man,
the
plaintiff
was
so
much
in
the
public
eye,
he
was
even
keeping
clippings
in
regard
his
own
testimony
of
all
the
stories
that
ocala
paper
read
about
him.
he
was
an
actor
on
the
public
stage.
he
was
trying
to
get
people
to
know
about
him.
he
was
seeking
publicity
and
because
of
those
public
activities,
because
of
he
was
seeking
the
public
eye,
this
new
newspaper
editor
who
had
this
job
about
a
month
had
heard
of
him
and
he
just
automatically
assumed
when
they
read
the
name
damron
over
the
phone.
they
were
talking
about
the
public
figure
and
so
he
put
the
public
figure's
name
in
the
article
and
wrote
the
article
about
the
public
figure
rather
than
about
his
brother.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
well,
the
reporter
who
called
it
in
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
that
the
report
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
that's
right,
everybody.
the
only
man
who
made
the
mistake
was
the
man
who
wrote
the
article
and
sent
in
and
had
it
published.
the
reporter
who
published
it
called
in
the
right
man.
this
new
man
just
simply
made
an
error.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
right
the
middle
of
it.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
right
in
the
middle,
two
or
three
weeks
before
the
election.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
as
i
understand
it,
right
square
in
the
middle
of
it
and
i
agree
with
you
that
the
man
who
wrote
this
story
was
in
error.
he
was
careless.
he
was
negligent,
but
he
certainly
wasn't
guilty
of
express
malice
or
a
calculated
lie
with
an
intent
to
harm.
he
just
plainly
made
a
mistake.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
the
next
day,
the
newspaper
ran
a
retraction
and
said,
“we're
sorry.
we
made
a
mistake.
we
got
the
wrong
man.”
the
next
day
or
a
few
days
later,
the
plaintiff
wrote
a
letter
into
the
paper
and
again,
said
i
am
mayor,
i'm
candidate
for
tax
assessor,
this
has
hurt
me.
you
got
it
wrong,
i
wasn't
the
man.
they
published
that.
a
few
days
later,
one
of
his
supporters
wrote
a
letter
to
the
newspaper
and
said,
you've
done
a
grave
injustice
to
this
man.
he's
a
mayor.
he's
candidate
for
tax
assessor.
it
hurt
him
with
the
electorate.
you're
a
bunch
of
terrible
people
to
run
this.
the
newspaper
ran
that.
so,
three
times,
the
newspaper
corrected
it,
but
what
i
say
is
that
the
new
york
times
doctrine
applies
because
this
man
made
his
own
bad.
he's
the
man
who
filed
a
complaint
and
said
he
was
a
public
figure.
he's
the
man
who
said
he
was
hurt
was
made.
he's
the
man
who
said
he
was
hurt
as
candidate
for
tax
assessor
and
having
made
bad,
he's
bound
by
it.
now,
as
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
that's
right.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
he's
gotten
in
bad
with
the
new
york
times
doctrines,
yes
sir,
he
can't
get
out
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
oh,
no.
certainly
not,
but
i'd
say
that
he's
pleaded
himself
and
proved
himself
within
the
new
york
times
doctrine.
now,
it's
true
that
the
story
didn't
say
leonard
damron,
mayor
or
leonard
damron,
a
candidate
for
tax
assessor.
it
barely
described
him
as
businessman
or
garage
man
or
some
of
that
kind,
but
the
only
reason
that
myer
put
his
name
in
that
story
because
myer
thought
that
it
was
a
public
figure,
so
he
wrote
a
story
about
a
public
figure.
now,
garrison
makes
it
clear
that
you
can't
separate
private
reputation
from
public
reputation.
and
two
are
so
intermingled
here
that
there's
no
way
for
him
to
get
a
verdict
for
damage
to
his
private
reputation
when
he
has
rejected
his
public
reputation.
now,
as
our
former
president,
the
honorable
harry
trumann
said,
“if
you
can't
stand
the
heat,
stay
out
of
the
kitchen.”
mr.
damron
instead
of
staying
out
of
the
kitchen
of
politics,
he
got
in
with
all
four
feet.
he
sought
publicity.
he
even
kept
the
record
of
his
clippings.
he
was
in
one
office
trying
to
run
this
little
town,
trying
to
stay
home.
he
was
trying
to
get
a
paying
office
in
the
county
and
since
he
is
in
the
kitchen,
he
can't
complain
because
of
comments.
we
respectfully
submit
that
under
the
circumstances
here,
the
new
york
times
doctrine
applies
because
of
his
own
allegations,
and
his
own
proof,
and
that
we
should
not
be
put
to
the
expense
of
another
trial
since
he
has
had
a
chance
to
put
on
all
of
his
evidences.
this
isn't
like
some
other
case
where
maybe
he
can't
get
it
all
in.
he
was
trying
to
get
a
half
million
dollars
in
punitive
damages,
so
he
put
in
all
the
malice
he
had
and
that
the
court
should
be
directed
to
enter
a
verdict
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
$22,000.00,
which
i
understand
purely
hearsay
was
two-year
salary,
$18,000.00
and
then
four
more
for
loss
of
business
in
his
store
or
hurt
feelings
and
that's
all.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
sir?
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
oh,
yes
because
he
specifically
in
florida.
now,
i
was
amazed
to
hear
a
case
yesterday
where
they
didn't
know
whether
it
was
compensatory
or
punitive
in
florida.
you
have
to
spell
out
blank
dollars
punitive,
blank
dollars
compensatory
and
there
was
no
verdict
given
for
punitive
damages.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
primarily
that,
yes
sir
because
he
had
lost
the
office.
he
also
claimed
that
he
had
--
had
some
loss
of
business.
of
course,
he
had
the
brother
who
was
indicted
for
perjury
running
the
business,
so
it's
kind
of
hard
to
see
how
that
could've
affected
the
situation.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
oh,
yes,
that
the
jury
--
the
judge
specifically
told
the
jury
that
they
could
bring
a
verdict
in
for
damages
that
he
had
sustained
as
a
public
servant
or
words
to
that
effect,
let
me
see
just
what
the
exact
word
was.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
the
jury
was
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
yes.
here's
what
they
told
that
he
could
--
the
jury
told
that
he
could
--
that
the
jury
could
bring
these
damages,
this
is
page
82
of
the
appendix.
first
as
to
compensatory
or
actual
damages,
you
may
award
a
sum
that
will
fully
and
adequately
compensate
the
plaintiff
for
his
mental
suffering,
embarrassment,
and
injury
to
his
reputation
as
a
citizen
and
public
official,
and
any
of
the
damage
that
would
naturally
flow
for
being
falsely
accused
of
felony.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
well,
that's
the
whole
theory
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
well
judge,
the
whole
theory
of
the
case
was
that
he
lost
the
election,
that's
what
all
the
witnesses
testified.
that's
the
whole
theory
on
which
the
case
was
tried.
that's
what
all
his
trial
witnesses
testified
about.
he
even
gave
the
salary
of
the
job
that
he
lost.
that
was
the
basis
on
which
the
case
was
tried
and
the
whole
theory
of
his
damages
as
primarily
as
he
alleged
in
his
complaint
was
that
he
was
a
mayor,
a
candidate
for
re-election
and
that
he
suffered
damage
in
that
capacity.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
may
it
please
the
court.
i
wasn't
in
the
trial
of
this
case
and
i'm
in
the
same
position
that
you
gentlemen
are.
i
have
to
rely
on
the
record
and
the
record
absolutely
shows
that
there
was
no
concession
of
liability.
now,
to
answer
your
question
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
that's
because
the
court
had
ruled
against
us.
now,
as
i
gather
what
happened,
mr.
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
i
don't
know
what
he
said.
the
record,
we
have
a
small
town
court
reporter
and
i
don't
know
how
accurate
his
reports
are.
all
i
knew
is
what
may
have
said
as
told
me
that
he
didn't
concede
any
liability,
but
i
can't
tell
you
why
he
didn't
raise
it
on
the
district
court
of
appeals.
in
the
district
court
of
appeal,
i
had
mr.
aires
with
me
and
mr.
aires
was
there
to
stand
up
and
defend
himself,
had
there
been
any
accusation
that
he
had
waived.
mr.
aires
participated
in
the
appeal
to
the
district
court
of
appeals,
signed
brief
and
was
in
on
that
appeal
and
he
could
have
defended
himself,
had
there
been
any
charge.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
well,
it
wasn't
raised.
now,
let
me
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
and
that
nobody
ever
suggested
to
the
district
court
of
appeals
that
this
point
had
been
raised
and
it
haven't
been
raised,
i
mean,
it
had
not
been
waived
as
the
record
itself
would
show.
why
on
earth
would
the
court
look
at
page
17
of
the
appendix,
look
at
the
order.
when
i
got
into
the
case
that
moved
for
a
new
trial
or
judgment
non
obstante
veredicto
on
new
york
times,
read
the
paragraph
two.
the
court
specifically
says,
the
decisions
of
united
states
supreme
court
and
so
forth
relating
to
public
officials
or
public
figures
in
the
official
conduct
of
their
position
or
office
are
not
applicable
to
this
cause
of
action
and
so
forth.
now,
why
would
the
judge
have
entered
that.
he
would
have
simply
have
said
well
your
motion
for
new
trial
is
denied
because
your
trial
counsel
admitted
liability
and
then
when
it
gets
over
to
the
district
court
of
appeals
as
mr.
justice
white
says,
why
would
the
whole
opinion
have
been
on
the
basis
that
we
agree
with
the
trial
court
that
new
york
times
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
if
trial
counsel
had
admitted
liability.
it's
just
something
i
don't
blame
my
friend
for
bringing
it
up
but
it
is
unsupported
by
the
record
and
all
i
can
tell
you
is
that,
the
more
you
tried
the
case,
though
he
didn't
concede
liability.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
i
think
that
clear,
i
think
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
that's
correct.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
that's
right.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
that's
correct
and
we
take
the
position
that
plaintiff's
own
pleadings
have
brought
him
under
new
york
times.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
i
think
the
florida
court
of
appeals,
had
this
point
been
raised
in
the
district
court
of
appeals,
the
district
court
of
appeals
would
have
looked
at
the
record
and
had
it
found
that
the
trial
counsel
aires
did
what
my
friend
here
accuses
him
off
they
would
have
said
that
at
that
instance.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
the
--
my
own
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
correct.
my
only
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
were
it
not
for
the
holdings
of
this
court
as
exemplified
by
beckley,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
to
how
bad
a
man's
prior
counsel
makes
of
the
case,
beckley
versus
hanks.
this
court
will
go
into
it
to
itself
and
even
though
trial
counsel
has
stood
there
and
not
objected
to
instructions
and
even
though
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
beckley
versus
hanks
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
you
held
in
that
case,
that
even
though
the
newspaper
counsel
actually
requested
the
wrong
instructions,
you
would
examine
and
if
you
would
found
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
as
exemplified
the
new
york
times
and
succeeding
cases
had
been
violated,
you
gentlemen
yourself,
yourselves
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
well
of
course,
i
don't
know
about
that,
but
that
issue
was
not
and
that
both
the
trial
judge
when
i
moved
for
a
new
trial
and
cited
all
these
constitutional
cases,
there
was
no
question.
he
didn't
say
oh,
i
am
sorry
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
i
don't
think
so
because
the
issue
wasn't
raised
then
in
the
first
place
and
i
don't
think
you
can
go
back.
i
would
certainly
argue
strenuously,
i'm
sure
the
court
would
agree
with
me
that
he
can't
come
up
here
and
then
go
back
and
say,
“well,
now
i
forgot
to
raise
something
here
and
now
i
want
to
raise
it,”
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
it
was
raised
in
the
trial
court
and
when
i
came
in
to
the
case
and
the
first
thing
i
did
was
to
file
a
motion
and
under
florida
procedure
at
that
time,
you
can
raise
these
points
and
filed
a
motion
and
not
only
had
a
motion,
but
cited
the
cases
by
name.
that
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
yes,
i
certainly
do.
and
there's
no
intimation
and
the
florida
appellate
courts
felt
that
wasn't
correct
and
the
district
court
of
appeals
assumed
that
the
issue
was
--
had
to
be
properly
preserved
and
wrote
its
entire
opinion
upon
the
one
issue
where
they
erroneously
said
that,
official
conduct
of
a
public
official
was
not
involved,
therefore,
new
york
times
doesn't
apply.
but
i'm
rather
surprised
what
you
gentlemen
said
about
beckley
because
you
held
in
beckley
versus
hanks;
in
that
case,
the
newspaper
lawyers
themselves
had
requested
the
own
instructions.
and
you
said
that
these
constitutional
issues
were
of
such
importance
that
even
though
they
haven't
raised
the
issues,
since
they
had
in
a
motion
for
new
trial
raised
the
question
as
to
whether
suspicion
in
evidence
was
there
that
you
would
pass
upon
the
question.
and
here,
i
filed
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
went
at
all
these
issues
and
cited
the
cases
and
i
wasn't
at
the
trial
but
i
say
that
this
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
yes
sir.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
i
read
it
sensibly.
this
is
the
third
view.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
well,
the
--
his
whole
testimony
was
that
he
had
lost
his
--
that
he
had
gotten
into
bad
with
the
electorate,
they
wouldn't
vote
for
him.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
yes
sir.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
well,
he
says
that
the
people
didn't
treat
him
as
nice
as
they
used
to.
they
kind
of
looked
down
at
him
when
he
passed
by,
and
that
he
wasn't
feeling
so
good
anymore,
and
he'd
lost
some
campaign
contributions,
and
people
said
a
man
like
that
shouldn't
run
for
office,
that's
all
and
the
fact
that
he
claimed
that
he
lost
some
business
in
his
garage
that
was
run
by
the
fellow
who
was
indicted.
but
new
york
times,
my
own
surmise
to
what
happened
is,
is
that
trial
counsel
was
not
down
so
hard
when
he
filed
his
motions
to
strike
the
new
york
times
damages
as
a
public
figure
and
moved
to
dismiss
for
one
of
malice.
he
was
thrown
down
so
hard
then
that
he
didn't
want
to
antagonize
the
judge
and
prejudice
himself
with
the
jury
by
raising
more
stuff
before
the
jury
or
at
the
trial
on
which
he
was
going
to
get
nothing
down
again.
that's
just
mu
own
speculation
as
to
why
my
friend
aires
didn't
say
more,
but
this
record
does
not
support
a
concession
of
liabilities.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
no,
we're
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
you
have
the
whole
record,
you
have
the
whole
record.
you
have
everything
as
of
course
as
is
customary
as
mr.
justice
harlan
pointed
out.
the
trial
counsel
was
so
concerned
with
the
punitive
damage
issue,
he
did
and
the
fact
there
was
no
question
that
we
did
run
the
article,
that
we
did
run
the
mistake,
that
there
had
to
be
a
concession
that
we
had
run
the
article
and
that
we
had
made
a
mistake.
he
conceded
that,
but
he
certainly
did
not
concede
that
--
the
question
of
liability.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
mr.
dunn's
argument
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
absolutely
correct.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
right
and
i'm
very
much
disturbed
that
this
opinion
being
in
the
printed
southern
reporter
which
says
that,
new
york
times
only
applies
to
official
conduct
of
a
public
official
leaving
out
characters,
matters
of
public
interest
and
all
the
rest
of
the
things
that
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
that's
right.
they
said,
it
didn't
come
within
new
york
times
because
it
didn't
relate
to
official
conduct
of
public
officials.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
mr.
chief
justice,
gentlemen
of
the
court.
this
is
a
right
interesting
libel
case.
the
trial
judge
actually
directed
a
verdict
for
the
plaintiff
on
compensatory
damages
and
told
the
jury
that
the
only
question
was
how
many
dollars
they
were
going
to
give
the
plaintiff
on
compensatory
damages?
as
to
punitive
damages,
he
told
the
jury
that
they
can
only
give
those
if
malice
were
proven
and
the
jury
brought
in
no
punitive
acts.
the
attorney
for
the
plaintiff
was
successful
in
urging
upon
the
court
and
the
florida
courts
have
consistently
held,
in
this
case,
that
the
new
york
times
doctrine
and
i
quote
from
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
of
appeal
on
review,
only
applies
“to
official
conduct
of
a
public
official.”
the
time
of
this
case
was
april
1966
at
the
height
of
the
civil
rights
controversy
in
the
south.
the
locale
was
rural
citrus
county,
population
9,268
without
even
a
daily
or
weekly
news
or
semi-weekly
newspaper
of
its
own.
plaintiff
damron
was
a
small
town
politician
and
garage
man.
he
was
mayor
of
the
municipality
of
crystal
river,
population
1,523
and
a
candidate
to
succeed
himself.
he
was
also
practically
a
full-time
candidate
for
county
tax
assessor,
politicking
for
that
job
while
his
brother
james
damron
ran
his
garage.
in
the
middle
of
the
election
campaign
for
county
tax
assessor,
and
of
course,
he
was
continuously
running
for
re-election
as
mayor
and
was
subsequently
defeated.
the
defendant
ocala
star-banner,
the
daily
newspaper
in
a
nearby
marion
county,
ran
the
offending
article.
in
the
article,
it
was
stated,
erroneously,
that
leonard
damron
rather
than
his
brother
had
had
a
case
continued
which
was
an
indictment
for
perjury
in
the
federal
court
in
the
civil
rights
case.
now,
if
there
was
anything
that
was
of
more
public
interest
in
the
rural
south
in
april
1966
than
civil
rights,
it
was
an
indictment
for
perjury
of
a
damron
in
a
civil
rights
case.
now,
the
article
was
written
by
a
man
named
myer,
who
just
recently
come
to
this
position
with
the
ocala
paper.
he
had
never
even
met
the
plaintiff,
but
he
had
written
a
number
of
articles
about
the
political
goings
on
in
crystal
river
where
there
two
factions
and
the
plaintiff
was
the
head
of
one
of
them.
and
when
the
story
was
phoned
in
to
him,
the
reporter
phoned
in
the
correct
name
of
james
damron,
but
the
area
editor
had
heard
so
much
about
and
had
written
so
much
about
this
politician
brother
that
throw
an
error,
he
just
automatically
wrote
down
the
wrong
name
and
that's
how
the
name
of
leonard
got
in
rather
than
james.
leonard
then
brought
a
suit
for
libel
and
he
specifically
alleged
and
i
quote
from
his
complaint
“that
he
was
a
public
officer
being
elected
to
the
office
of
mayor
of
crystal
river
and
a
candidate
for
the
office
of
tax
assessor
of
citrus
county.”
then,
he
charged
that
the
words
of
the
article
imputed
perjury
and
again
i
quote
his
exact
words
“to
the
electorate
of
crystal
river
and
citrus
county.”
he
then
went
on
to
allege
that
the
article
was
published
in
the
middle
of
the
election
campaign
and
cost
him
the
election
and
he
concluded
by
claiming
damages
to
his
reputation
as
a
“public
officer
and
candidate
for
public
office.”
he
didn't
even
alleged
malice
in
his
complaint.
the
word
malice
doesn't
appear
in
it,
even
though
the
court
did
submit
the
issue
of
malice
on
punitive
damages.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
malice
in
a
libel
suit,
yes
sir,
certainly,
under
new
york
times,
you'd
have
to
allege
malice.
the
newspaper
moved
to
dismiss
the
complaint
because
of
the
failure
to
allege
malice
and
moved
to
strike
the
public
figure
damages
where
he
was
claiming
damages
to
him
as
mayor
and
as
candidate
for
public
office.
both
motions
were
denied.
the
case
came
on
for
trial
and
the
court,
as
i
say,
actually
instructed
the
jury
to
bring
in
a
verdict
on
community
--
on
compensatory
damages,
the
only
question
being
the
amount
of
dollars.
plaintiff
testified
that
he
had
been
defeated
for
county
tax
assessor.
he
gave
the
salary
of
the
office.
he
further
testified
that
he
was
defeated
for
re-election
as
mayor.
his
trail
witnesses
repeatedly
testified
as
to
the
effect
that
this
article
had
had
on
his
standing
with
the
electorate
and
that
that
was
what
it
cost
him
the
election.
motion
for
new
trial
and
judgment
non
obstante
veredicto
was
filed.
it
expressly
urged
the
new
york
times
cases,
the
motion
was
denied.
the
florida
district
court
of
appeal
affirmed
on
the
judgment
on
the
directed
verdict,
holding
that
the
new
york
times
doctrine
only
applied
to
“official
conduct
of
a
public
official”
and
that
this
alleged
libel
wasn't
a
libel
that
he
had
done
as
a
public
official.
the
florida
supreme
court
refused
to
review
the
case
and
this
court
has
granted
certiorari.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
and
our
understanding
and
it's
pure
hearsay,
is
that
the
jury
verdict
was
made
of
two-year
salary,
$18,000
and
the
extra
was
a
little
bonus,
that's
where
the
verdict
came
from.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
well,
he
didn't
get
paid
in
that.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
that
was
a
non-paying
job.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
but
the
whole
thrust
of
the
case,
mr.
justice
stewart
was
that
this
article
was
published
right
in
the
middle
of
the
election
campaign,
when
it
was
too
late
for
me
to
do
anything
about
it.
i
am
mayor,
i'm
trying
to
continue
to
be
mayor.
i'm
a
candidate
for
county
tax
assessor
and
this
article
is
what
has
cost
me
the
job.
now,
i
can
say
all
that,
he
said
it.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
well,
it's
all
that
he
did
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
yes,
because
there
isn't
any
question
that
we
made
a
mistake.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
yes,
i
don't
think
there's
--
that
was
his
whole
theory
and
if
you
erroneously
accuse
a
man
of
being
indicted
for
perjury
under
civil
rights
case,
under
rule
of
florida
in
1966,
well
he's
goner,
short
of
being
elected
to
public
office,
there
isn't
any
question
about
that.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
oh,
yes.
he
intermingled
the
two.
he
said
that
he
had
lost
business
in
this
garage
shop
that
his
brother,
the
one
that
was
indicted
was
running
for
him
and
then
of
course,
he
said,
he
felt
bad
and
it
made
him
feel
bad
with
his
neighbors
and
so
forth,
had
been
accused
of
this
thing
and
that
sort
of
thing,
he
brought
that
in.
but
the
real
thrust
of
this
case
was
that
i
have
been
defeated
for
county
tax
assessor
and
i
lost
my
job
as
mayor.
now,
clearly
new
york
times
applies
to
a
situation
of
this
kind
where
the
plaintiff
made
his
own
bet.
i
didn't
try
the
case,
but
the
lawyer
who
tried
the
case
didn't
come
in
and
say
that
he
was
a
public
figure.
the
plaintiff
brought
his
suit
and
specifically
alleged
that
he
was
a
public
figure
that
he
was
the
mayor
running
for
re-election,
that
it
one
stand,
that
he
was
the
candidate
for
tax
assessor,
and
that
he's
been
damaged
as
a
candidate
and
as
mayor.
now,
we
say
under
those
circumstances
that
this
case
should
not
be
sent
back
for
another
trial
to
have
more
expense,
but
that
this
court
should
direct
a
verdict
for
the
newspaper.
now,
he
had
ample
opportunity
in
this
case
to
prove
this
malice
because
he
was
seeking
a
half
million
dollars
in
punitive
damages
in
his
complaint
and
he
brought
in
everything
he
could
on
malice
to
sustain
his
punitive
damages,
so
has
had
a
chance
to
prove
his
malice.
the
only
thing
that
he
showed
on
malice
were
three
innocuous
articles,
written
not
by
the
man
who
wrote
this
story,
but
by
somebody
else
in
the
past
about
him,
one
of
which
said,
that
he
had
walked
out
of
council
meetings
and
he
said,
well,
i
had
differences
to
the
council,
but
i
had
never
physically
walked
out.
another
one
said,
he
had
clashes
with
the
council.
he
said,
well,
i
had
differences
with
them,
but
i
didn't
have
any
clashes
and
the
other
one
he
says
gave
an
erroneous
salary
for
the
city
attorney.
now,
certainly
those
articles
were
not
sufficient
to
establish
malice
and
that's
all
he
has.
as
i
say,
the
man
who
wrote
the
article
made
a
mistake.
there
isn't
any
question.
the
reporter
phoned
it
in
and
she
had
the
right
name,
but
this
man,
the
plaintiff
was
so
much
in
the
public
eye,
he
was
even
keeping
clippings
in
regard
his
own
testimony
of
all
the
stories
that
ocala
paper
read
about
him.
he
was
an
actor
on
the
public
stage.
he
was
trying
to
get
people
to
know
about
him.
he
was
seeking
publicity
and
because
of
those
public
activities,
because
of
he
was
seeking
the
public
eye,
this
new
newspaper
editor
who
had
this
job
about
a
month
had
heard
of
him
and
he
just
automatically
assumed
when
they
read
the
name
damron
over
the
phone.
they
were
talking
about
the
public
figure
and
so
he
put
the
public
figure's
name
in
the
article
and
wrote
the
article
about
the
public
figure
rather
than
about
his
brother.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
well,
the
reporter
who
called
it
in
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
that
the
report
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
that's
right,
everybody.
the
only
man
who
made
the
mistake
was
the
man
who
wrote
the
article
and
sent
in
and
had
it
published.
the
reporter
who
published
it
called
in
the
right
man.
this
new
man
just
simply
made
an
error.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
right
the
middle
of
it.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
right
in
the
middle,
two
or
three
weeks
before
the
election.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
as
i
understand
it,
right
square
in
the
middle
of
it
and
i
agree
with
you
that
the
man
who
wrote
this
story
was
in
error.
he
was
careless.
he
was
negligent,
but
he
certainly
wasn't
guilty
of
express
malice
or
a
calculated
lie
with
an
intent
to
harm.
he
just
plainly
made
a
mistake.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
the
next
day,
the
newspaper
ran
a
retraction
and
said,
“we're
sorry.
we
made
a
mistake.
we
got
the
wrong
man.”
the
next
day
or
a
few
days
later,
the
plaintiff
wrote
a
letter
into
the
paper
and
again,
said
i
am
mayor,
i'm
candidate
for
tax
assessor,
this
has
hurt
me.
you
got
it
wrong,
i
wasn't
the
man.
they
published
that.
a
few
days
later,
one
of
his
supporters
wrote
a
letter
to
the
newspaper
and
said,
you've
done
a
grave
injustice
to
this
man.
he's
a
mayor.
he's
candidate
for
tax
assessor.
it
hurt
him
with
the
electorate.
you're
a
bunch
of
terrible
people
to
run
this.
the
newspaper
ran
that.
so,
three
times,
the
newspaper
corrected
it,
but
what
i
say
is
that
the
new
york
times
doctrine
applies
because
this
man
made
his
own
bad.
he's
the
man
who
filed
a
complaint
and
said
he
was
a
public
figure.
he's
the
man
who
said
he
was
hurt
was
made.
he's
the
man
who
said
he
was
hurt
as
candidate
for
tax
assessor
and
having
made
bad,
he's
bound
by
it.
now,
as
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
that's
right.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
he's
gotten
in
bad
with
the
new
york
times
doctrines,
yes
sir,
he
can't
get
out
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
oh,
no.
certainly
not,
but
i'd
say
that
he's
pleaded
himself
and
proved
himself
within
the
new
york
times
doctrine.
now,
it's
true
that
the
story
didn't
say
leonard
damron,
mayor
or
leonard
damron,
a
candidate
for
tax
assessor.
it
barely
described
him
as
businessman
or
garage
man
or
some
of
that
kind,
but
the
only
reason
that
myer
put
his
name
in
that
story
because
myer
thought
that
it
was
a
public
figure,
so
he
wrote
a
story
about
a
public
figure.
now,
garrison
makes
it
clear
that
you
can't
separate
private
reputation
from
public
reputation.
and
two
are
so
intermingled
here
that
there's
no
way
for
him
to
get
a
verdict
for
damage
to
his
private
reputation
when
he
has
rejected
his
public
reputation.
now,
as
our
former
president,
the
honorable
harry
trumann
said,
“if
you
can't
stand
the
heat,
stay
out
of
the
kitchen.”
mr.
damron
instead
of
staying
out
of
the
kitchen
of
politics,
he
got
in
with
all
four
feet.
he
sought
publicity.
he
even
kept
the
record
of
his
clippings.
he
was
in
one
office
trying
to
run
this
little
town,
trying
to
stay
home.
he
was
trying
to
get
a
paying
office
in
the
county
and
since
he
is
in
the
kitchen,
he
can't
complain
because
of
comments.
we
respectfully
submit
that
under
the
circumstances
here,
the
new
york
times
doctrine
applies
because
of
his
own
allegations,
and
his
own
proof,
and
that
we
should
not
be
put
to
the
expense
of
another
trial
since
he
has
had
a
chance
to
put
on
all
of
his
evidences.
this
isn't
like
some
other
case
where
maybe
he
can't
get
it
all
in.
he
was
trying
to
get
a
half
million
dollars
in
punitive
damages,
so
he
put
in
all
the
malice
he
had
and
that
the
court
should
be
directed
to
enter
a
verdict
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
$22,000.00,
which
i
understand
purely
hearsay
was
two-year
salary,
$18,000.00
and
then
four
more
for
loss
of
business
in
his
store
or
hurt
feelings
and
that's
all.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
sir?
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
oh,
yes
because
he
specifically
in
florida.
now,
i
was
amazed
to
hear
a
case
yesterday
where
they
didn't
know
whether
it
was
compensatory
or
punitive
in
florida.
you
have
to
spell
out
blank
dollars
punitive,
blank
dollars
compensatory
and
there
was
no
verdict
given
for
punitive
damages.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
primarily
that,
yes
sir
because
he
had
lost
the
office.
he
also
claimed
that
he
had
--
had
some
loss
of
business.
of
course,
he
had
the
brother
who
was
indicted
for
perjury
running
the
business,
so
it's
kind
of
hard
to
see
how
that
could've
affected
the
situation.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
oh,
yes,
that
the
jury
--
the
judge
specifically
told
the
jury
that
they
could
bring
a
verdict
in
for
damages
that
he
had
sustained
as
a
public
servant
or
words
to
that
effect,
let
me
see
just
what
the
exact
word
was.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
the
jury
was
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
yes.
here's
what
they
told
that
he
could
--
the
jury
told
that
he
could
--
that
the
jury
could
bring
these
damages,
this
is
page
82
of
the
appendix.
first
as
to
compensatory
or
actual
damages,
you
may
award
a
sum
that
will
fully
and
adequately
compensate
the
plaintiff
for
his
mental
suffering,
embarrassment,
and
injury
to
his
reputation
as
a
citizen
and
public
official,
and
any
of
the
damage
that
would
naturally
flow
for
being
falsely
accused
of
felony.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
well,
that's
the
whole
theory
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
well
judge,
the
whole
theory
of
the
case
was
that
he
lost
the
election,
that's
what
all
the
witnesses
testified.
that's
the
whole
theory
on
which
the
case
was
tried.
that's
what
all
his
trial
witnesses
testified
about.
he
even
gave
the
salary
of
the
job
that
he
lost.
that
was
the
basis
on
which
the
case
was
tried
and
the
whole
theory
of
his
damages
as
primarily
as
he
alleged
in
his
complaint
was
that
he
was
a
mayor,
a
candidate
for
re-election
and
that
he
suffered
damage
in
that
capacity.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
may
it
please
the
court.
i
wasn't
in
the
trial
of
this
case
and
i'm
in
the
same
position
that
you
gentlemen
are.
i
have
to
rely
on
the
record
and
the
record
absolutely
shows
that
there
was
no
concession
of
liability.
now,
to
answer
your
question
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
that's
because
the
court
had
ruled
against
us.
now,
as
i
gather
what
happened,
mr.
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
i
don't
know
what
he
said.
the
record,
we
have
a
small
town
court
reporter
and
i
don't
know
how
accurate
his
reports
are.
all
i
knew
is
what
may
have
said
as
told
me
that
he
didn't
concede
any
liability,
but
i
can't
tell
you
why
he
didn't
raise
it
on
the
district
court
of
appeals.
in
the
district
court
of
appeal,
i
had
mr.
aires
with
me
and
mr.
aires
was
there
to
stand
up
and
defend
himself,
had
there
been
any
accusation
that
he
had
waived.
mr.
aires
participated
in
the
appeal
to
the
district
court
of
appeals,
signed
brief
and
was
in
on
that
appeal
and
he
could
have
defended
himself,
had
there
been
any
charge.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
well,
it
wasn't
raised.
now,
let
me
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
and
that
nobody
ever
suggested
to
the
district
court
of
appeals
that
this
point
had
been
raised
and
it
haven't
been
raised,
i
mean,
it
had
not
been
waived
as
the
record
itself
would
show.
why
on
earth
would
the
court
look
at
page
17
of
the
appendix,
look
at
the
order.
when
i
got
into
the
case
that
moved
for
a
new
trial
or
judgment
non
obstante
veredicto
on
new
york
times,
read
the
paragraph
two.
the
court
specifically
says,
the
decisions
of
united
states
supreme
court
and
so
forth
relating
to
public
officials
or
public
figures
in
the
official
conduct
of
their
position
or
office
are
not
applicable
to
this
cause
of
action
and
so
forth.
now,
why
would
the
judge
have
entered
that.
he
would
have
simply
have
said
well
your
motion
for
new
trial
is
denied
because
your
trial
counsel
admitted
liability
and
then
when
it
gets
over
to
the
district
court
of
appeals
as
mr.
justice
white
says,
why
would
the
whole
opinion
have
been
on
the
basis
that
we
agree
with
the
trial
court
that
new
york
times
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
if
trial
counsel
had
admitted
liability.
it's
just
something
i
don't
blame
my
friend
for
bringing
it
up
but
it
is
unsupported
by
the
record
and
all
i
can
tell
you
is
that,
the
more
you
tried
the
case,
though
he
didn't
concede
liability.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
i
think
that
clear,
i
think
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
that's
correct.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
that's
right.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
that's
correct
and
we
take
the
position
that
plaintiff's
own
pleadings
have
brought
him
under
new
york
times.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
i
think
the
florida
court
of
appeals,
had
this
point
been
raised
in
the
district
court
of
appeals,
the
district
court
of
appeals
would
have
looked
at
the
record
and
had
it
found
that
the
trial
counsel
aires
did
what
my
friend
here
accuses
him
off
they
would
have
said
that
at
that
instance.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
the
--
my
own
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
correct.
my
only
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
were
it
not
for
the
holdings
of
this
court
as
exemplified
by
beckley,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
to
how
bad
a
man's
prior
counsel
makes
of
the
case,
beckley
versus
hanks.
this
court
will
go
into
it
to
itself
and
even
though
trial
counsel
has
stood
there
and
not
objected
to
instructions
and
even
though
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
beckley
versus
hanks
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
you
held
in
that
case,
that
even
though
the
newspaper
counsel
actually
requested
the
wrong
instructions,
you
would
examine
and
if
you
would
found
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
as
exemplified
the
new
york
times
and
succeeding
cases
had
been
violated,
you
gentlemen
yourself,
yourselves
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
well
of
course,
i
don't
know
about
that,
but
that
issue
was
not
and
that
both
the
trial
judge
when
i
moved
for
a
new
trial
and
cited
all
these
constitutional
cases,
there
was
no
question.
he
didn't
say
oh,
i
am
sorry
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
i
don't
think
so
because
the
issue
wasn't
raised
then
in
the
first
place
and
i
don't
think
you
can
go
back.
i
would
certainly
argue
strenuously,
i'm
sure
the
court
would
agree
with
me
that
he
can't
come
up
here
and
then
go
back
and
say,
“well,
now
i
forgot
to
raise
something
here
and
now
i
want
to
raise
it,”
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
it
was
raised
in
the
trial
court
and
when
i
came
in
to
the
case
and
the
first
thing
i
did
was
to
file
a
motion
and
under
florida
procedure
at
that
time,
you
can
raise
these
points
and
filed
a
motion
and
not
only
had
a
motion,
but
cited
the
cases
by
name.
that
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
yes,
i
certainly
do.
and
there's
no
intimation
and
the
florida
appellate
courts
felt
that
wasn't
correct
and
the
district
court
of
appeals
assumed
that
the
issue
was
--
had
to
be
properly
preserved
and
wrote
its
entire
opinion
upon
the
one
issue
where
they
erroneously
said
that,
official
conduct
of
a
public
official
was
not
involved,
therefore,
new
york
times
doesn't
apply.
but
i'm
rather
surprised
what
you
gentlemen
said
about
beckley
because
you
held
in
beckley
versus
hanks;
in
that
case,
the
newspaper
lawyers
themselves
had
requested
the
own
instructions.
and
you
said
that
these
constitutional
issues
were
of
such
importance
that
even
though
they
haven't
raised
the
issues,
since
they
had
in
a
motion
for
new
trial
raised
the
question
as
to
whether
suspicion
in
evidence
was
there
that
you
would
pass
upon
the
question.
and
here,
i
filed
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
went
at
all
these
issues
and
cited
the
cases
and
i
wasn't
at
the
trial
but
i
say
that
this
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
yes
sir.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
i
read
it
sensibly.
this
is
the
third
view.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
well,
the
--
his
whole
testimony
was
that
he
had
lost
his
--
that
he
had
gotten
into
bad
with
the
electorate,
they
wouldn't
vote
for
him.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
yes
sir.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
well,
he
says
that
the
people
didn't
treat
him
as
nice
as
they
used
to.
they
kind
of
looked
down
at
him
when
he
passed
by,
and
that
he
wasn't
feeling
so
good
anymore,
and
he'd
lost
some
campaign
contributions,
and
people
said
a
man
like
that
shouldn't
run
for
office,
that's
all
and
the
fact
that
he
claimed
that
he
lost
some
business
in
his
garage
that
was
run
by
the
fellow
who
was
indicted.
but
new
york
times,
my
own
surmise
to
what
happened
is,
is
that
trial
counsel
was
not
down
so
hard
when
he
filed
his
motions
to
strike
the
new
york
times
damages
as
a
public
figure
and
moved
to
dismiss
for
one
of
malice.
he
was
thrown
down
so
hard
then
that
he
didn't
want
to
antagonize
the
judge
and
prejudice
himself
with
the
jury
by
raising
more
stuff
before
the
jury
or
at
the
trial
on
which
he
was
going
to
get
nothing
down
again.
that's
just
mu
own
speculation
as
to
why
my
friend
aires
didn't
say
more,
but
this
record
does
not
support
a
concession
of
liabilities.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
no,
we're
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
you
have
the
whole
record,
you
have
the
whole
record.
you
have
everything
as
of
course
as
is
customary
as
mr.
justice
harlan
pointed
out.
the
trial
counsel
was
so
concerned
with
the
punitive
damage
issue,
he
did
and
the
fact
there
was
no
question
that
we
did
run
the
article,
that
we
did
run
the
mistake,
that
there
had
to
be
a
concession
that
we
had
run
the
article
and
that
we
had
made
a
mistake.
he
conceded
that,
but
he
certainly
did
not
concede
that
--
the
question
of
liability.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
mr.
dunn's
argument
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
absolutely
correct.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
right
and
i'm
very
much
disturbed
that
this
opinion
being
in
the
printed
southern
reporter
which
says
that,
new
york
times
only
applies
to
official
conduct
of
a
public
official
leaving
out
characters,
matters
of
public
interest
and
all
the
rest
of
the
things
that
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
that's
right.
they
said,
it
didn't
come
within
new
york
times
because
it
didn't
relate
to
official
conduct
of
public
officials.
