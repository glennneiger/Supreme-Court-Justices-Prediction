justice
potter
stewart
but
of
course
that’s
--
that
all.
i
appreciate
your
answering
my
brother
white
question
but
that
all
does
go
to
the
merits?
justice
potter
stewart
what
you’ve
become
relevant
if
has
or
when
this
motion
to
file
a
complaint
is
granted,
then
only
then
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
would
assume
that
the
ordinary
concepts
of
pleading
we
have
a
motion
to
file
a
complaint
then
we
could
assume
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
are
true
for
that
purpose
of
that
motion.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
real
problem
here,
our
initial
problem
and
what
this
--
the
argument
on
this
motion
is
directed
to
i
would
--
should
suppose
would
be
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court,
its
original
jurisdiction.
as
you
say,
there
seems
to
be
no
doubt
of
that
jurisdiction
under
article
iii
of
section
2
and
action
by
a
state
against
citizens
of
the
different
states.
and
then
an
answer
to
my
brother
harlan,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
it
was
your
position
that
the
court
had
absolutely
no
jurisdiction
in
this
area.
what
i
think
you
say
--
what
i
think
you
said,
meant
to
say
no
discretion
to
this
area
that
since
the
constitution
conferred
jurisdiction
that
was
it.
but
i
think
perhaps
you
meant
and
perhaps
what
you
did
say
was
that
in
light
of
the
deciding
cases
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
court
should
allow
the
complaint
to
be
filed
and
in
the
light
of
its
decided
cases,
the
court’s
discretion
was
limited
by
those
precedents
and
would
require
filing
of
the
complaint.
justice
potter
stewart
if
we
want
to
deny
this
motion,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
but
now
--
justice
potter
stewart
right
justice
potter
stewart
just
to
get
back
to
the
--
what
i
have
thought
was
really
the
only
thing
before
us
and
that
is
motion
to
file
a
bill
of
complaint.
justice
potter
stewart
and
not
a
matter
of
beyond
the
facts
of
the
case
whether
your
allegations
are
correct
or
incorrect,
certainly
not
a
matter
of
relief
yet
but
a
motion
to
file
a
complaint
and
i
understand
your
position
that
under
the
decided
cases,
under
those
precedents
is
motion
ought
to
be
granted.
but
i
--
you
do
concede,
do
you
not
that
article
iii,
section
2
does
not
confer
at
compulsory
jurisdiction
in
and
of
its
own
terms
on
case
of
this
nature,
don’t
you?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
massachusetts
against
mellon
said
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it’s
your
submission
i
guess
it’s
agreed
that
you
could
not
bring
this
--
you
cannot
file
this
complaint
in
a
federal
district
court?
justice
potter
stewart
let
me
ask
the
question.
justice
potter
stewart
because
there
is
no
diversity
and
because
there's
no
federal
question?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
why
couldn’t
you
file
it
in
a
common
pleas
court
in
the
state
of
ohio?

be
helpful

very
recently?

there

left

the

much
more
to
catch
anymore.

that’s
left
there,
isn’t
it?
