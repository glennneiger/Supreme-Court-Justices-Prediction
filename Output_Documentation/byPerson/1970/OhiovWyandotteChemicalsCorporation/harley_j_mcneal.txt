mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
in
our
view
in
the
light
of
the
present
knowledge
and
expertise
concerning
mercury
pollution
in
lake
erie,
it
is
respectfully
suggested
ohio’s
proposed
litigation
is
premature
and
may
very
well
be
ill-advised
because
of
the
posture
in
which
the
complaint
comes
to
this
court.
with
about
three
defendants,
when
as
my
brothers
have
stated
there
are
many
known
polluters
of
lake
erie.
mercury
polluters,
municipal
government
polluters,
sewage,
phosphates
almost
innumerable
number
including
other
chemicals
which
are
now
by
reason
of
expertise
being
found
to
be
also
polluters.
so,
in
the
court’s
discretion,
which
i
believe
this
court
has
in
this
case
in
considering
the
issues
raised
by
the
complaint.
i
believe
with
but
three
defendants,
one
being
a
foreign
alien
this
court
would
be
proper
and
right
and
just
in
refusing
to
entertain
ohio’s
complaint
on
the
basis
that
complaint
involves
not
only
the
judiciary
but
it
also
involves
the
political
sides
of
our
government.
namely
the
executive
and
the
legislative
branches
so
that
in
the
exercise
of
this
court’s
jurisdiction,
it
is
believe
that
this
court
should
examine
carefully
whether
the
complaint
of
ohio
on
its
phase
demonstrates
whether
there
is
or
is
not
a
lack
of
satisfactory
criteria
which
would
enable
this
court
in
the
posture
in
which
complaint
comes
to
make
a
binding
judicial
determination
which
would
be
determinant
of
the
problem
of
mercury
pollution
in
the
great
lakes
particularly
lake
erie.
when
we
know
new
york,
pennsylvania,
michigan
and
ontario
also
are
interested
in
lake
erie
and
its
pollution.
it
seems
very
difficult
for
me
to
understand
how
this
court
with
the
power
that
it
has
would
be
able
to
legislate
or
make
a
judicial
finding
which
would
satisfy
ohio
in
so
far
as
ohio’s
common
law
is
concerned
leaving
open
a
judicial
determination
of
the
rights
and
interests
of
the
other
states
and
that
of
ontario.
further,
i
believe
this
court
in
exercising
its
jurisdiction
and
discretion
should
ascertain
whether
there
are
alternative
forums
available
which
could
by
reason
of
their
structure
reach
a
better
determination
in
the
long
run
and
over
a
long
period
of
time
than
the
narrow
kind
finds
of
a
judicial
decree
in
the
posture
that
pollution
now
is.
with
the
state
of
expertise
and
the
present
knowledge
that
we
have
concerning
pollution
and
the
number
of
pollutants
and
the
people
involved.
i
say
this
because
to
me
it
is
most
important
that
this
court
consider
that
provisions
of
the
boundary
waters
treaty
of
1909
which
was
proclaimed
by
the
two
governments
wherein
it
was
stated
generally
that
in
so
far
as
canada
and
the
united
states
would
be
concerned
pollution
of
the
boundary
waters
which
occurred
on
one
side
of
the
boundary
of
the
other
which
resulted
in
harm
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
other
side
would
be
determined
by
means
of
an
international
joint
commission
and
the
history
of
what
the
international
joint
commission
has
done
concerning
investigation
of
pollution
i
believe
is
most
important.
beginning
in
1918,
the
international
joint
commission
handed
down
a
report
wherein
in
that
report
the
international
joint
commission
was
required
to
investigate
the
extent,
causes
and
where
the
boundary
waters
were
polluted
so
as
to
be
injurious
to
public
health
and
unfit
for
domestic
and
other
users.
in
the
1918
report,
the
international
joint
commission
concluded
at
that
time
that
pollution
was
very
intense
along
the
shores
of
the
detroit
and
niagara
rivers
and
that
a
condition
existed
which
would
impair
the
health
and
excellence
and
welfare
of
the
citizens.
now,
what
have
the
two
governments
done
since
1918?
by
two
joint
references,
the
executive
branches
of
two
governments
have
referred
the
problem
of
pollution
to
the
international
joint
commission
under
the
boundary
waters
treaty.
in
1946,
both
governments
requested
the
international
joint
commission
to
investigate
pollution
problems
in
the
st.
mary,
st.
clair,
detroit
and
niagara
rivers.
and
in
1950,
the
international
joint
commission
reported
certain
water
quality
of
objectives
to
restore
and
maintain
the
waters
which
they
were
requested
to
investigate.
mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
the
two
governments
approved
the
recommendations
and
this
resulted
in
pollution
abatement
programs
being
set
up
by
various
enforcement
agencies
in
canada
and
in
the
united
states.
now,
as
late
as
october
of
1964,
by
another
joint
reference
to
the
international
joint
commission
the
executive
branches
of
the
two
governments
referred
an
investigation
of
the
waters
of
lake
erie
and
so
far
as
pollution
is
concerned.
and
by
my
brother
mr.
outerbridge,
you
have
heard
him
state
that
the
report
concerning
the
investigation
of
pollution
of
the
waters
of
lake
erie
was
filed
by
the
state
department
wherein
the
international
joint
commission
reported
and
i
think
it
is
helpful
to
summarize
what
the
international
joint
commission
found
and
reported
through
the
state
department
of
the
united
states
which
filed
the
report.
the
international
joint
commission
found
that
until
1968,
mercury
was
thought
to
be
very
stable
that
it
could
not
be
established
with
certainty
that
the
concentration
of
a
particular
pollutant
on
one
side
of
the
boundary
is
due
to
any
specific
source
on
the
other
side.
contaminants
from
both
sides
of
the
boundary
are
affecting
and
degrading
the
water
qualities
of
lake
erie.
in
order
to
achieve
effective
pollution
control,
the
laws
of
the
governments
interested
in
lake
erie’s
pollution
problems
must
be
coordinated
to
avoid
in
action
and
inconsistency.
the
economic
cause
and
social
consequences
of
the
pollution
problem
will
be
our
most
difficult
one
to
assess.
the
international
joint
commission
also
said
studies
are
necessary
to
find
solutions
to
the
legislative
legal
and
enforcement
problems
related
to
curtailing
and
eliminating
the
sources
of
pollution.
the
solution
of
such
social
problems
may
well
prove
as
difficult
and
time-consuming
as
the
solution
of
all
of
the
scientific
and
technical
problems
involved.
this
brings
me
to
my
point,
this
court
exercising
its
discretion.
in
as
much
as
there
has
been
no
emergency,
in
so
far
as
ohio
is
concerned
because
ohio
within
10
days
after
it
declared
a
fishing
ban
lifted
that
fishing
ban.
the
only
species
of
fish
which
may
not
be
commercially
fished
today
is
the
walleye
type.
the
ban
went
into
effect
april
10th
in
1970
and
i
believe
as
to
most
other
fish
was
lifted
on
april
22nd
or
thereabouts
1970
so
that
the
commercial
fish
men
who
were
unable
to
commercially
fished
and
sell
fish
were
held
up
for
a
matter
of
10
days.
the
inhabitants
of
ohio
are
not
advised
not
to
buy
fish.
the
commercial
fishermen
may
sell
fish
and
things
are
going
on
in
so
far
as
the
taking
of
fish
from
lake
erie
as
they
did
before.
now,
why
is
this?
because
at
least
in
the
newspaper
reports
it
was
found
that
87%
of
the
fish
that
were
banned
indicating
that
they
were
commercially
unfit
within
10
days
after
ohio
had
put
a
ban
on
commercial
fishing
were
found
to
be
well
below
the
dangerous
level
of
metal
mercury
which
was
said
to
be
toxic
in
so
far
as
humans
are
concerned.
so
that
my
point
is
that
if
there
is
no
emergency
in
so
far
as
ohio’s
position
is
concerned,
this
court
exercising
its
discretion
may
well
refuse
to
entertain
ohio’s
complaint
because
ohio
has
a
basis
whereby
it
may
bring
exception
in
the
court
of
common
pleas
in
ohio.
it
may
resort
to
the
international
joint
commission
and
contrary
to
what
my
brother
has
mr.
strauss
has
said.
i
believe
under
article
ii
of
the
boundary
waters
treaty
which
reads,
“the
exclusive
jurisdiction
and
control
of
the
use
and
diversion
whether
temporary
or
permanent
of
all
waters
on
each
side
of
the
line
which
in
the
natural
channels
would
flow
across
the
boundary
or
enter
the
boundary
waters
are
reserve
to
that
nation.
and
that
if
there
is
some
damage
or
resulting
in
any
injury
on
the
other
side
of
the
boundary
that
nation
which
causes
the
condition
shall
give
rise
to
the
same
rights
and
entitle
the
injured
parties
to
the
same
legal
remedies
as
if
the
entry
took
place
in
the
country
in
canada.
so
that
i
say,
in
my
interpretation
of
article
ii
that
ohio
has
the
right
to
use
the
good
offices
of
the
ontario
courts
to
present
this
problem
if
they
want
to
get
at
dow
canada.
they
have
the
right
to
sue
in
their
own
jurisdiction
in
the
court
of
common
pleas
in
ohio
and
under
the
treaty
ohio
has
the
perfect
vehicle
to
have
an
adjudication.
my
brother
mr.
strauss
also
said
that
they
also
said
that
under
the
treaty
that
no
powers
of
arbitration
yet
in
the
trail
smelter
case
which
is
the
landmark
case
involving
pollution
where
a
company
in
canada
was
polluting
the
air
in
the
state
of
washington.
the
two
nations,
canada
and
the
united
states
referred
the
problem
to
the
international
joint
commission.
the
international
joint
commission
took
testimony,
learned
about
the
issues
and
reported
back
to
the
two
governments
with
recommendations.
as
a
result
of
that
investigation
and
the
hearings
that
were
had
it
was
decided
that
a
commission
would
be
chosen
a
tribunal
appointed
and
that
tribunal
proceeded
to
find
liability
and
to
assess
damages.
these
was
all
done
under
the
boundary
waters
treaty
and
under
article
x
of
the
boundary
waters
treaty,
it
is
provided
that
where
there
is
a
dispute
between
the
united
states
and
canada,
the
high
contracting
parties
may
refer
the
matter
to
an
umpire
chosen
in
accordance
with
the
proceedings
proscribed
in
the
fourth,
fifth
and
sixth
paragraphs
of
the
haig
convention.
for
the
pacific
settlement
of
international
disputes
such
umpire
shall
have
the
power
to
render
a
final
decision
with
respect
to
those
matters
and
questions
so
referred
on
which
the
commission
shall
fail
to
agree.
so
that
there
is
built-in
to
the
boundary
waters
treaty
--
a
provision
whereby
if
the
international
joint
commission
so
recommends
to
the
two
nations
that
there
be
a
finding
of
fault
and
a
determination
of
liability.
this
can
be
accomplished
under
the
terms
and
provisions
of
the
boundary
waters
treaty.
mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
consulting
the
state
department,
requesting
of
the
state
department
that
there
is
a
problem
involving
pollution
of
lake
erie
which
they
believe
it
comes
within
the
terms
and
provisions
of
the
boundary
waters
treaty
which
will
then
enable
the
state
department
and
the
executive
of
department
of
canada
to
consult
on
the
matter
and
if
they
come
to
an
agreement
refer
to
the
international
joint
commission
which
in
turn
will
handle
the
matter
to
a
conclusion.
and
this
has
been
done
and
the
landmark
case
is
the
trail
smelter
case
to
burden
this
court
with
this
kind
of
litigation
which
would
be
interminable
by
reason
of
the
information
that
one
has
to
acquire,
the
scientific
knowledge
that
has
to
be
presented,
the
witnesses
who
would
have
to
be
subpoenaed,
who
would
have
to
appear
would
seem
to
me
to
be
an
improper
forum.
there
are
added
matters
which
entitle
this
court
to
give
time
to
decide.
mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan?
mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
i
would
only
say
mr.
justice
brennan
that
i
believe
that
the
boundary
waters
treaty
is
the
very
vehicle
which
had
had
this.
mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
yes,
sir.
mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
well,
i
think
under
--
i
think
it
was
an
opinion
brady
versus
carr
which
i
believe
your
honor
wrote
that
opinion.
i
believe
it
is
proper
for
this
court
where
there
is
no
government
action
taken
for
this
court
to
examine
whether
or
not
the
boundary
waters
treaty
provides
the
answer
to
this
problem.
and
i
believe
that
was
the
effect
and
the
weight
of
what
the
opinion
stated
in
brady
versus
carr.
mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
well,
mr.
justice
white,
i
am
somewhat
at
a
lost
to
answer
that
because
the
state
department
was
the
vehicle
which
filed
this
very
report
which
was
filed
on
january
of
14th.
so
that
i
cannot
conceive
of
the
state
department
becoming
interested
in
the
international
joint
commission’s
report
and
yet
saying
that
the
international
joint
commission
isn’t
the
proper
vehicle
to
determine
problems
of
pollution
arising
in
lake
erie.
and
it
just
doesn’t
seem
to
fit
under
the
circumstances.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
yes.
mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
mr.
justice
black,
the
claim
was
made
in
the
brief
filed
by
ohio
that
in
as
much
as
dow
canada
was
a
wholly-owned
subsidiary
that
that
then
--
mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
dow
canada.
mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
yes.
dow
u.s.
owns
all
of
the
stock.
mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
of
dow
u.s.
mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
yes
sir
but
we
don’t
think
that
the
mere
ownership
of
stock
if
the
subsidiary
--
mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
they
own
all
of
the
stock,
but
that
is
only
one
of
the
criteria
--
mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
no,
i
don’t
believe
so
because
dow
canada
is
a
separate
entity.
it
has
its
own
contracts
--
mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
well,
they
own
the
stock
sir,
but
i
--
mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
but
i
won't
concede
that
it
becomes
an
agent
of
dow
u.s.
because
it
is
conducting
its
own
business
within
the
territory
of
canada
and
has
its
own
contracts
and
has
its
own
board
of
directors
and
it
has
its
own
finances
an
furnishes
the
dow
balance
sheet.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
no
sir,
that
would
come
--
mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
that
is
correct
mr.
just
harlan.
mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
there
is
no
record
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
there
is
a
complaint
which
says
--
mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
the
allegation
is
that
dow
canada
is
a
wholly-owned
subsidiary
of
dow
u.s.
mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
you
have
it
in
the
complaint,
yes
sir.
mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
i
can't
deny
it
for
this
purpose.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
in
our
view
in
the
light
of
the
present
knowledge
and
expertise
concerning
mercury
pollution
in
lake
erie,
it
is
respectfully
suggested
ohio’s
proposed
litigation
is
premature
and
may
very
well
be
ill-advised
because
of
the
posture
in
which
the
complaint
comes
to
this
court.
with
about
three
defendants,
when
as
my
brothers
have
stated
there
are
many
known
polluters
of
lake
erie.
mercury
polluters,
municipal
government
polluters,
sewage,
phosphates
almost
innumerable
number
including
other
chemicals
which
are
now
by
reason
of
expertise
being
found
to
be
also
polluters.
so,
in
the
court’s
discretion,
which
i
believe
this
court
has
in
this
case
in
considering
the
issues
raised
by
the
complaint.
i
believe
with
but
three
defendants,
one
being
a
foreign
alien
this
court
would
be
proper
and
right
and
just
in
refusing
to
entertain
ohio’s
complaint
on
the
basis
that
complaint
involves
not
only
the
judiciary
but
it
also
involves
the
political
sides
of
our
government.
namely
the
executive
and
the
legislative
branches
so
that
in
the
exercise
of
this
court’s
jurisdiction,
it
is
believe
that
this
court
should
examine
carefully
whether
the
complaint
of
ohio
on
its
phase
demonstrates
whether
there
is
or
is
not
a
lack
of
satisfactory
criteria
which
would
enable
this
court
in
the
posture
in
which
complaint
comes
to
make
a
binding
judicial
determination
which
would
be
determinant
of
the
problem
of
mercury
pollution
in
the
great
lakes
particularly
lake
erie.
when
we
know
new
york,
pennsylvania,
michigan
and
ontario
also
are
interested
in
lake
erie
and
its
pollution.
it
seems
very
difficult
for
me
to
understand
how
this
court
with
the
power
that
it
has
would
be
able
to
legislate
or
make
a
judicial
finding
which
would
satisfy
ohio
in
so
far
as
ohio’s
common
law
is
concerned
leaving
open
a
judicial
determination
of
the
rights
and
interests
of
the
other
states
and
that
of
ontario.
further,
i
believe
this
court
in
exercising
its
jurisdiction
and
discretion
should
ascertain
whether
there
are
alternative
forums
available
which
could
by
reason
of
their
structure
reach
a
better
determination
in
the
long
run
and
over
a
long
period
of
time
than
the
narrow
kind
finds
of
a
judicial
decree
in
the
posture
that
pollution
now
is.
with
the
state
of
expertise
and
the
present
knowledge
that
we
have
concerning
pollution
and
the
number
of
pollutants
and
the
people
involved.
i
say
this
because
to
me
it
is
most
important
that
this
court
consider
that
provisions
of
the
boundary
waters
treaty
of
1909
which
was
proclaimed
by
the
two
governments
wherein
it
was
stated
generally
that
in
so
far
as
canada
and
the
united
states
would
be
concerned
pollution
of
the
boundary
waters
which
occurred
on
one
side
of
the
boundary
of
the
other
which
resulted
in
harm
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
other
side
would
be
determined
by
means
of
an
international
joint
commission
and
the
history
of
what
the
international
joint
commission
has
done
concerning
investigation
of
pollution
i
believe
is
most
important.
beginning
in
1918,
the
international
joint
commission
handed
down
a
report
wherein
in
that
report
the
international
joint
commission
was
required
to
investigate
the
extent,
causes
and
where
the
boundary
waters
were
polluted
so
as
to
be
injurious
to
public
health
and
unfit
for
domestic
and
other
users.
in
the
1918
report,
the
international
joint
commission
concluded
at
that
time
that
pollution
was
very
intense
along
the
shores
of
the
detroit
and
niagara
rivers
and
that
a
condition
existed
which
would
impair
the
health
and
excellence
and
welfare
of
the
citizens.
now,
what
have
the
two
governments
done
since
1918?
by
two
joint
references,
the
executive
branches
of
two
governments
have
referred
the
problem
of
pollution
to
the
international
joint
commission
under
the
boundary
waters
treaty.
in
1946,
both
governments
requested
the
international
joint
commission
to
investigate
pollution
problems
in
the
st.
mary,
st.
clair,
detroit
and
niagara
rivers.
and
in
1950,
the
international
joint
commission
reported
certain
water
quality
of
objectives
to
restore
and
maintain
the
waters
which
they
were
requested
to
investigate.
mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
the
two
governments
approved
the
recommendations
and
this
resulted
in
pollution
abatement
programs
being
set
up
by
various
enforcement
agencies
in
canada
and
in
the
united
states.
now,
as
late
as
october
of
1964,
by
another
joint
reference
to
the
international
joint
commission
the
executive
branches
of
the
two
governments
referred
an
investigation
of
the
waters
of
lake
erie
and
so
far
as
pollution
is
concerned.
and
by
my
brother
mr.
outerbridge,
you
have
heard
him
state
that
the
report
concerning
the
investigation
of
pollution
of
the
waters
of
lake
erie
was
filed
by
the
state
department
wherein
the
international
joint
commission
reported
and
i
think
it
is
helpful
to
summarize
what
the
international
joint
commission
found
and
reported
through
the
state
department
of
the
united
states
which
filed
the
report.
the
international
joint
commission
found
that
until
1968,
mercury
was
thought
to
be
very
stable
that
it
could
not
be
established
with
certainty
that
the
concentration
of
a
particular
pollutant
on
one
side
of
the
boundary
is
due
to
any
specific
source
on
the
other
side.
contaminants
from
both
sides
of
the
boundary
are
affecting
and
degrading
the
water
qualities
of
lake
erie.
in
order
to
achieve
effective
pollution
control,
the
laws
of
the
governments
interested
in
lake
erie’s
pollution
problems
must
be
coordinated
to
avoid
in
action
and
inconsistency.
the
economic
cause
and
social
consequences
of
the
pollution
problem
will
be
our
most
difficult
one
to
assess.
the
international
joint
commission
also
said
studies
are
necessary
to
find
solutions
to
the
legislative
legal
and
enforcement
problems
related
to
curtailing
and
eliminating
the
sources
of
pollution.
the
solution
of
such
social
problems
may
well
prove
as
difficult
and
time-consuming
as
the
solution
of
all
of
the
scientific
and
technical
problems
involved.
this
brings
me
to
my
point,
this
court
exercising
its
discretion.
in
as
much
as
there
has
been
no
emergency,
in
so
far
as
ohio
is
concerned
because
ohio
within
10
days
after
it
declared
a
fishing
ban
lifted
that
fishing
ban.
the
only
species
of
fish
which
may
not
be
commercially
fished
today
is
the
walleye
type.
the
ban
went
into
effect
april
10th
in
1970
and
i
believe
as
to
most
other
fish
was
lifted
on
april
22nd
or
thereabouts
1970
so
that
the
commercial
fish
men
who
were
unable
to
commercially
fished
and
sell
fish
were
held
up
for
a
matter
of
10
days.
the
inhabitants
of
ohio
are
not
advised
not
to
buy
fish.
the
commercial
fishermen
may
sell
fish
and
things
are
going
on
in
so
far
as
the
taking
of
fish
from
lake
erie
as
they
did
before.
now,
why
is
this?
because
at
least
in
the
newspaper
reports
it
was
found
that
87%
of
the
fish
that
were
banned
indicating
that
they
were
commercially
unfit
within
10
days
after
ohio
had
put
a
ban
on
commercial
fishing
were
found
to
be
well
below
the
dangerous
level
of
metal
mercury
which
was
said
to
be
toxic
in
so
far
as
humans
are
concerned.
so
that
my
point
is
that
if
there
is
no
emergency
in
so
far
as
ohio’s
position
is
concerned,
this
court
exercising
its
discretion
may
well
refuse
to
entertain
ohio’s
complaint
because
ohio
has
a
basis
whereby
it
may
bring
exception
in
the
court
of
common
pleas
in
ohio.
it
may
resort
to
the
international
joint
commission
and
contrary
to
what
my
brother
has
mr.
strauss
has
said.
i
believe
under
article
ii
of
the
boundary
waters
treaty
which
reads,
“the
exclusive
jurisdiction
and
control
of
the
use
and
diversion
whether
temporary
or
permanent
of
all
waters
on
each
side
of
the
line
which
in
the
natural
channels
would
flow
across
the
boundary
or
enter
the
boundary
waters
are
reserve
to
that
nation.
and
that
if
there
is
some
damage
or
resulting
in
any
injury
on
the
other
side
of
the
boundary
that
nation
which
causes
the
condition
shall
give
rise
to
the
same
rights
and
entitle
the
injured
parties
to
the
same
legal
remedies
as
if
the
entry
took
place
in
the
country
in
canada.
so
that
i
say,
in
my
interpretation
of
article
ii
that
ohio
has
the
right
to
use
the
good
offices
of
the
ontario
courts
to
present
this
problem
if
they
want
to
get
at
dow
canada.
they
have
the
right
to
sue
in
their
own
jurisdiction
in
the
court
of
common
pleas
in
ohio
and
under
the
treaty
ohio
has
the
perfect
vehicle
to
have
an
adjudication.
my
brother
mr.
strauss
also
said
that
they
also
said
that
under
the
treaty
that
no
powers
of
arbitration
yet
in
the
trail
smelter
case
which
is
the
landmark
case
involving
pollution
where
a
company
in
canada
was
polluting
the
air
in
the
state
of
washington.
the
two
nations,
canada
and
the
united
states
referred
the
problem
to
the
international
joint
commission.
the
international
joint
commission
took
testimony,
learned
about
the
issues
and
reported
back
to
the
two
governments
with
recommendations.
as
a
result
of
that
investigation
and
the
hearings
that
were
had
it
was
decided
that
a
commission
would
be
chosen
a
tribunal
appointed
and
that
tribunal
proceeded
to
find
liability
and
to
assess
damages.
these
was
all
done
under
the
boundary
waters
treaty
and
under
article
x
of
the
boundary
waters
treaty,
it
is
provided
that
where
there
is
a
dispute
between
the
united
states
and
canada,
the
high
contracting
parties
may
refer
the
matter
to
an
umpire
chosen
in
accordance
with
the
proceedings
proscribed
in
the
fourth,
fifth
and
sixth
paragraphs
of
the
haig
convention.
for
the
pacific
settlement
of
international
disputes
such
umpire
shall
have
the
power
to
render
a
final
decision
with
respect
to
those
matters
and
questions
so
referred
on
which
the
commission
shall
fail
to
agree.
so
that
there
is
built-in
to
the
boundary
waters
treaty
--
a
provision
whereby
if
the
international
joint
commission
so
recommends
to
the
two
nations
that
there
be
a
finding
of
fault
and
a
determination
of
liability.
this
can
be
accomplished
under
the
terms
and
provisions
of
the
boundary
waters
treaty.
mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
consulting
the
state
department,
requesting
of
the
state
department
that
there
is
a
problem
involving
pollution
of
lake
erie
which
they
believe
it
comes
within
the
terms
and
provisions
of
the
boundary
waters
treaty
which
will
then
enable
the
state
department
and
the
executive
of
department
of
canada
to
consult
on
the
matter
and
if
they
come
to
an
agreement
refer
to
the
international
joint
commission
which
in
turn
will
handle
the
matter
to
a
conclusion.
and
this
has
been
done
and
the
landmark
case
is
the
trail
smelter
case
to
burden
this
court
with
this
kind
of
litigation
which
would
be
interminable
by
reason
of
the
information
that
one
has
to
acquire,
the
scientific
knowledge
that
has
to
be
presented,
the
witnesses
who
would
have
to
be
subpoenaed,
who
would
have
to
appear
would
seem
to
me
to
be
an
improper
forum.
there
are
added
matters
which
entitle
this
court
to
give
time
to
decide.
mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan?
mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
i
would
only
say
mr.
justice
brennan
that
i
believe
that
the
boundary
waters
treaty
is
the
very
vehicle
which
had
had
this.
mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
yes,
sir.
mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
well,
i
think
under
--
i
think
it
was
an
opinion
brady
versus
carr
which
i
believe
your
honor
wrote
that
opinion.
i
believe
it
is
proper
for
this
court
where
there
is
no
government
action
taken
for
this
court
to
examine
whether
or
not
the
boundary
waters
treaty
provides
the
answer
to
this
problem.
and
i
believe
that
was
the
effect
and
the
weight
of
what
the
opinion
stated
in
brady
versus
carr.
mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
well,
mr.
justice
white,
i
am
somewhat
at
a
lost
to
answer
that
because
the
state
department
was
the
vehicle
which
filed
this
very
report
which
was
filed
on
january
of
14th.
so
that
i
cannot
conceive
of
the
state
department
becoming
interested
in
the
international
joint
commission’s
report
and
yet
saying
that
the
international
joint
commission
isn’t
the
proper
vehicle
to
determine
problems
of
pollution
arising
in
lake
erie.
and
it
just
doesn’t
seem
to
fit
under
the
circumstances.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
yes.
mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
mr.
justice
black,
the
claim
was
made
in
the
brief
filed
by
ohio
that
in
as
much
as
dow
canada
was
a
wholly-owned
subsidiary
that
that
then
--
mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
dow
canada.
mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
yes.
dow
u.s.
owns
all
of
the
stock.
mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
of
dow
u.s.
mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
yes
sir
but
we
don’t
think
that
the
mere
ownership
of
stock
if
the
subsidiary
--
mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
they
own
all
of
the
stock,
but
that
is
only
one
of
the
criteria
--
mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
no,
i
don’t
believe
so
because
dow
canada
is
a
separate
entity.
it
has
its
own
contracts
--
mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
well,
they
own
the
stock
sir,
but
i
--
mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
but
i
won't
concede
that
it
becomes
an
agent
of
dow
u.s.
because
it
is
conducting
its
own
business
within
the
territory
of
canada
and
has
its
own
contracts
and
has
its
own
board
of
directors
and
it
has
its
own
finances
an
furnishes
the
dow
balance
sheet.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
no
sir,
that
would
come
--
mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
that
is
correct
mr.
just
harlan.
mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
there
is
no
record
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
there
is
a
complaint
which
says
--
mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
the
allegation
is
that
dow
canada
is
a
wholly-owned
subsidiary
of
dow
u.s.
mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
you
have
it
in
the
complaint,
yes
sir.
mr.
harley
j.
mcneal
i
can't
deny
it
for
this
purpose.
thank
you,
sir.
