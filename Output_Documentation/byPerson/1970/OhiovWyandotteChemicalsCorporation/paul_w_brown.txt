mr.
paul
w.
brown
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
have
here
a
case
which
involves
mercury
pollution
in
the
great
lakes,
an
immense
problem
which
has
become
more
max
as
we
have
factually
realized
that
the
mercury
pollution
is
extremely
damaging
to
health
and
life
of
our
citizens.
now,
we
address
this
action
to
the
original
jurisdiction
to
this
court
under
article
iii,
section
2,
cl.
2
of
the
constitution
and
we
think
that
the
court
has
in
an
exceedingly
clear
way
outlined
the
cases
in
which
such
an
action
is
proper.
we
think
the
georgia
versus
the
tennessee
copper
company
is
extremely
in
point
and
the
new
jersey
versus
new
york
is
extremely
in
point
and
that
each
of
these
cases
provide
in
a
similar
factual
situation
that
this
court
will
hear
a
complaint
so
addressed
by
a
state
against
the
citizens
of
another
state
and
against
the
residence
of
a
foreign
country.
in
each
instance,
the
factual
--
the
facts
are
identical
in
that.
acts
were
committed
the
situs
of
which
was
outside
of
the
complaining
state
but
which
created
a
nuisance
within
the
state
and
this
court
intervened
for
the
purpose
of
enjoining.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
in
the
tennessee
case,
i
think
it
applied
the
common
law
of
the
--
mr.
paul
w.
brown
the
common
--
no,
the
common
law
of
the
state
of
georgia.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
it
seems
to
me
that
here
we
must.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
it
seems
to
here
it
hasn’t
occurred
to
me
that
we
could
apply
in
this
case
anything
except
the
common
law
of
the
state
of
ohio
where
the
nuisance
occurred.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
no,
we
are
not
claiming
under
a
federal
statute.
we
are
claiming
under
the
federal
constitution
the
right
to
file.
we
have
no
federal
question
here.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
we
are
not
stating
a
federal
cause
of
action,
we
are
filing
this
under
the
common
law
of
the
state
of
ohio
and
addressing
our
complaint
as
was
done
in
these
other
two
cases
--
mr.
paul
w.
brown
no
sir,
it
does
not.
if
it
does
it
wasn’t
intended
that
it
should.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
a
common
law
--
mr.
paul
w.
brown
right
and
our
right
to
do
so,
arises
from
the
constitution
and
from
these
two
cases
and
only
from
that.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
i
think
you're
obligated
to
apply
ohio
common
law
with
regard
to
whether
or
not
this
constitutes
a
nuisance
and
i
think
you're
obligated
to
apply
ohio
common
law
with
regard
to
questions
of
damages
which
may
arise
in
the
case.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
yes.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
it
does.
i
have
been
appointed
special
counsel
by
my
successor
to
come
here
and
argue
the
case
at
this
time.
we
desperately
want
it
to
be
maintained,
we
think
this
is
our
only
forum.
we
think
that
if
we
go
to
a
lower
federal
court,
we
are
confronted
by
the
fact
that
we
do
not
have
a
federal
question
nor
do
we
have
diversity
of
citizenship.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
we
do
not
fall
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
but
there
is
no
other
except
our
state
court
and
the
purpose
for
including
in
the
constitution.
the
requirement
the
state
might
come
here
for
original
jurisdiction
or
so
that
we
might
not
have
to
do
exactly
that.
that
we
might
not
have
to
confront
our
adversaries
in
their
court,
in
their
state
court
with
this
question
which
is
so
important
--
mr.
paul
w.
brown
in
their
state
court,
in
our
state
court
also
we
could.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
we
could.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
we
felt
that
the
purpose
for
including
in
the
federal
constitution
the
requirement,
the
right,
this
forum
as
original
jurisdiction,
was
so
that
this
would
not
be
necessary
between
the
state
and
the
citizens
of
another
state.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
it
is
not
explicit.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
no.
no,
we
could
sue
in
our
own
state
and
we
could
of
course
sue
in
the
foreign
forum,
but
we
take
the
posture
that
we
do
not
need
to
as
georgia
did
not
need
to
or
as
new
jersey
did
not
need
to.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
i
think
it’s
ours
and
i
think
this
court
has
already
defined
the
cases
in
which
he
will
hear
such
cases.
the
massachusetts
versus
mellon
case
outlines
the
factual
situation
which
is
again
identical
to
ours
and
that
is
one
where
we
are
filing
suit
in
our
proprietary
capacity
and
we
are
protecting
our
citizens
in
their
rights
to
air,
water,
and
land
and
of
course
anyone
who
argues
as
do
our
opponents
in
their
brief
that
we
do
not
hold
title
or
we
are
not
to
be
fires
of
ohio
land
and
water
for
this
purpose
are
entering
into
a
legal
quibble.
we
feel
that
we
are
properly
here,
we
feel
that
this
court
has
carefully
defined
in
the
two
cases
cited
--
georgia
versus
tennessee
and
also
in
new
jersey
versus
new
york
that
this
is
a
proper
court.
we
think
that
except
from
our
own
court,
it
is
the
only
we
have
no
federal
court
available
to
us
except
this
court
and
we
think
that
the
concern
of
the
people
of
ohio
and
each
people
of
the
great
lakes
district
with
the
ecology
of
the
great
lakes
is
so
real
that
this
court
ought
to
grant
our
motion.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
we’ve
made
our
prayer
quite
general
issue
(inaudible)
observed.
i
think
we
ought
to
go
in
--
we’ve
asked
for
an
injunction,
we've
asked
for
damages
in
lieu
of
that
and
we've
asked
for
compensatory
damages.
we
feel
that
under
the
cases
that
we've
read,
we
are
entitled
to
all
of
these
things
or
some
of
them
at
least
if
for
some
reason
we
can't
enjoin
further,
dumping
of
mercury,
metallic
mercury
into
the
detroit
and
st.
clair
river
then
--
and
if
that
metallic
mercury
which
has
been
placed
in
the
river
by
the
defendants,
polluters
here
with
no
other
status
than
polluters
who
have
within
three
or
four
days
after
discovering
that
they
should
not
pollute
found
ways
of
substantially
reducing
the
pollution.
if
we
cannot
get
injunction
and
removal
then
we
think
we
have
very
properly
asked
this
court
for
damages
and
we
think
that
we
asked
for
damages
for
two
purposes.
one,
to
give
ohio
in
money
those
things
that
it
has
lost
which
are
its
natural
resources
and
belong
to
all
of
its
people.
and
two
and
i
think
this
is
most
important
to
say
the
polluters
generally
who
are
not
fearful
of
injunctions
because
they
continue
to
produce
and
continue
to
pollute
until
they
are
enjoined
from
so
doing.
but
to
say
to
them
in
the
future,
damages
will
be
awarded
for
the
state
or
its
natural
resources
in
those
instances
where
you
have
placed
into
the
public
water
and
air,
commodities
which
can
be
removed
if
it
only
with
the
great
difficulty.
we
rather
enjoy
being
confronted
by
the
defendant
saying
it’s
impractical
for
us
to
remove
this
mercury
from
the
river
the
st.
clair
and
the
detroit
river.
we
don’t
believe
it
is
because
metallic
mercury
there
in
the
river
is
at
the
point
where
it
was
discharged
into
the
river
by
dow
canada
has
been
tested
and
checked
in
it
comes
to
1,400
to
1,800
parts
per
million
of
metallic
mercury
still
embedded
in
the
slime
and
industrial
debris
at
the
bottom
of
that
river,
it’s
there.
the
thing
that
we've
learned
in
the
last
few
years
is
that
this
metallic
mercury
by
the
action
of
the
small
living
animals
in
the
bottom
of
that
sludge.
in
the
absence
of
oxygen
are
able
to
convert
metallic
mercury
into
mercury
which
can
be
assumed
that
would
--
and
which
enters
the
food
change
and
this
of
course
is
what
was
discovered
in
1969
which
brought
about
the
order
from
both
ohio
and
from
ontario
that
fishing
be
stopped
in
the
lakes
because
it
was
discovered
that
more
than
50%
of
the
fish
tested
exceeded
mercury
content
of
0.5
parts
per
million
in
a
ratable
portions.
now,
some
of
them
exceeded
this
by
so
much
that
it
is
dirt
line,
fearsome
and
dangerous
because
some
of
the
more
8
parts
per
million
of
mercury
--
methyl
mercury
in
the
flesh
of
these
fish
and
some
of
them
in
lake
st.
clair
where
as
much
as
10
parts
per
million.
now,
in
japan
where
they
had
116
deaths
for
severe
neurological
damage
from
which
arose
from
the
fact
the
people
in
minamata
bay
area
where
consuming
fish
arose
in
instances
where
the
fish
had
only
double
that
amount,
only
double
that
amount
and
the
deaths
that
occurred
and
the
neurological
damage
that
occurred
was
so
severe
that
they
were
included
in
those
number
16
cases
of
children
who
were
born
with
birth
defects
because
of
the
inclusion
of
this
methyl
mercury
in
their
food.
now
we
are
--
sir?
mr.
paul
w.
brown
i
think
the
right
already
exists
for
--
if
i
understand
your
question
for
ohio
to
ask
for
damages
against
those
who
polluted
in
this
instance
--
mr.
paul
w.
brown
this
is
under
the
state
common
law
sir.
we
don’t
have
a
federal
law.
there
is
no
federal
law
on
this
--
there
is
no
federal
bar
to
this
action.
this
is
argued
in
the
briefs
of
dolan
and
not
in
the
brief
of
wyandotte.
wyandotte
admits
that
there
is
no
federal
bar
that
neither
the
treaty
nor
the
international
commission
bars
our
action.
the
solicitor
general
agrees
with
us
that
there
is
no
federal
bar.
the
solicitor
general
i
think
will
argue
this
in
detail
and
i
leave
part
of
this
to
him
for
that
purpose,
but
there
is
no
bar
that
we’re
properly
within
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
and
that
the
only
question
and
that
we
are
here
as
a
proprietor
and
we
are
seeking
damages
for
all
the
people
and
that
these
cases
every
case
here
reflects
our
rights
so
--
mr.
paul
w.
brown
sir?
mr.
paul
w.
brown
we
seek
damages,
yes
sir
for
the
state’s
right
as
a
proprietor
of
its
natural
resources
for
all
of
its
people.
now,
you
do
have
and
you
have
decided
cases
which
are
cited
in
the
defendant’s
brief
and
which
this
court
did
not
take
original
jurisdiction
in
cases
and
which
the
damages
were
sought
for
a
particular
group
of
people
and
those
cases
do
not
apply
here
because
our
address
our
plaintiff
--
mr.
paul
w.
brown
we
do
have
one
already
sir.
the
action
is
there
for
damages.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
there
is
one
there
sir
and
we
could
use
it
except
under
the
constitution
we’re
entitled
to
bring
our
action
in
this
court
and
i
feel
that
this
--
mr.
paul
w.
brown
it’s
article
iii
of
the
constitution
section
2
cl.
2
of
federal
constitution
and
there
is
a
28
united
states
code
annotated.
there
is
--
this
right
is
formalize
in
the
federal
statute
that
says,
--
mr.
paul
w.
brown
yes.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
i
don’t
agree.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
i
do
not
agree.
the
work
“discretion”
occurs
in
a
footnote
in
the
solicitor
general’s
brief.
the
real
way
this
court
should
determine
whether
or
not
it
accepts
is
either
is
to
follow
the
guidelines
which
have
already
been
set
up
by
this
court
in
massachusetts
versus
mellon
in
which
this
court
said
that
the
state
merely
had
--
merely
being
a
party
did
not
give
a
right
to
come
in
here.
it
must
also
have
a
justiciable
lawsuit
and
we
have
such,
we
have
a
lawsuit.
it
doesn’t
fall
within
any
of
the
cases
in
which
in
this
court
in
which
a
state
has
been
precluded
from
action
and
it
does
fall
within
those
on
the
right
side
of
the
jurisdictional
guidelines
which
were
drawn
by
this
court
and
very
clearly
stated
in
massachusetts
versus
mellon.
there
are
some
other
cases
which
the
defendant
argues
which
do
not
apply.
the
defendants
in
this
case
have
set
up
a
number
of
strong
men.
they
as
polluters
have
tried
desperately
to
use
every
measure
to
continue
to
pollute.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
these
are
factual
questions
which
we
would
get
to
in
the
merits.
but
we
do
not
think
they
have
seized
to
pollute.
in
fact,
we
have
indications
that
canada
does
not
think
that
they
have
seized
to
pollute
and
that
canada
is
about
to
file
further
judicial
action
there
against
dow.
now
we
have
this
--
mr.
paul
w.
brown
i
think
this
is
a
ploy
that
polluters
generally
use.
in
other
words,
when
you
catch
me,
i
will
stop.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
they
are
still
introducing
mercury
to
the
water,
they
admitted
at
least
to
the
point
of
half
of
pound
a
day.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
i
think
it
should
be
a
matter
for
the
special
master.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
if
we
fail
to
prove
our
case
then
of
course
we
will
lose,
but
we
have
to
prove
that
they
not
only
have
polluted
but
the
pollution
continues.
in
addition
to
this,
metallic
mercury
concentrated
at
the
point
which
the
effluent
is
dumped
into
the
river
by
dow
and
by
wyandotte
it
is
still
there
on
the
bottom
of
the
river
and
it’s
still
being
leached
away
by
the
passage
of
water
there
over
it,
and
is
still
being
acted
upon
by
the
bacteria
throughout
the
lakes
so
that
you
continue
to
get
pollution
which
was
cause
and
brought
about
by
their
original
action.
in
addition
to
that,
this
proceeding
is
going
to
be
--
have
to
be
constantly
monitored
because
the
amount
of
sewage
and
other
industrial
waste
that
is
in
the
lake
made
by
other
changes
began
to
react
upon
this
metallic
mercury
at
an
ever
increasing
rate
so
that
we
may
get
a
higher
rate
of
mercury
pollution
in
the
fish
themselves
without
the
addition
of
any
additional
mercury.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
we
believe
we
can
show
that
the
chlor-alkali
process
of
making
caustic
soda
and
the
chlorine
is
the
process
which
provides
by
far
the
greatest
percentage
in
amount
of
this
particular
pollutant
mercury.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
no
other,
there
are.
we
believe
the
evidence
would
clearly
show
there
are
no
other
substantial
polluters
that
these
people
are
the
only
substantial
polluters
in
this
particular
area
and
we
believe
that
if
there
are
other
substantial
polluters
we
would
be
delighted
to
have
the
defendants
make
the
parties
after
wherein
here
on
the
merits.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
it
does
go
to
the
merits
and
i
am
afraid
that
--
mr.
paul
w.
brown
right
and
i
am
afraid
that
the
judgment
with
regard
to
our
motion
may
turn
upon
your
anticipation
of
what
the
merits
are
and
hence,
i
must
strongly
state
that
the
facts
are
with
us
and
against
our
opponents.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
that’s
right.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
right.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
you’ll
have
to
write
some
new
law
if
you
want
to
exercise
discretion
in
this
case.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
right.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
right
now,
i
was
going
to
supreme
court
of
ohio
and
we
have
the
same
complaint
made
to
us.
we
were
final
and
hence,
we
had
a
certain
discretion.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
but
under
the
cases
which
have
been
written
and
under
the
constitution
and
laws
on
the
books,
we
are
entitled
to
be
here
and
the
only
question
that
i
would
have
any
difficulty
with
answering
is
the
question
of
the
exact
shape
and
form
of
the
final
decree
in
this
court,
which
is
also
something
we
must
reach
when
we
develop
all
the
factual
background.
now,
what
ohio
wants
to
do
--
mr.
paul
w.
brown
that’s
all
there
is
before
us,
sir.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
it
seems
to
me
(voice
overlap)
if
we
address
our
--
mr.
paul
w.
brown
it
said
that
we
had
to
be
a
party
and
in
additional
we
had
to
have
lawsuit,
it’s
exactly
what
it
said.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
when
we
are
a
party
and
we
do
have
a
lawsuit.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
it
affects
individuals
and
groups
differently
then
it
affects
the
public
generally
but
this
has
never
been
a
test
under
any
case
that
i
read.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
it
does.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
it
has
unique
position
factually
with
regard
to
injury
and
that
80%
of
the
fish,
if
we’re
going
to
discuss
that
80%
of
the
fish
are
in
the
ohio
waters.
most
--
mr.
paul
w.
brown
we
filed
motion
intended
to
petition.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
well,
there
is
something
else
you
can
do
sir
and
i
beg
your
pardon
if
you
gather
that
i
say
nothing
that
you
have
no
discretion.
of
course
you
have
an
existing
discretion
to
deny
any
case
and
there
would
be
nothing
i,
as
an
applicant
to
the
court
could
do
about
it
because
the
finality
of
your
judgment.
but
mr.
justice
stewart
has
said
exactly
what
i
think
my
position
is
and
that
is
the
constitution
is
clear,
the
federal
statute
is
clear
and
the
cases
that
this
court
has
here
before
decided
are
clear
and
those
which
we've
cited
say
we
have
a
right
in
these
particular
facts
to
address
ourselves
to
your
court
in
this
way.
and
those
which
have
denied
this
court
to
others
for
reasons
which
have
been
stated,
those
reasons
do
not
apply
to
us
or
to
our
action.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
we
could
not
and
there
is
an
amicus
briefs
filed
by
the
attorney
general
(voice
overlap).
mr.
paul
w.
brown
sir,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
right.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
and
this
was
raised
also
by
kelly
from
michigan
the
attorney
general
who
joined
with
us
as
amicus
been
sought
this
court
to
intervene.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
we
could
file
in
a
common
pleas
court
in
the
state
of
ohio
but
because
we
have
the
right
as
we
view
it
under
the
constitution
to
say
this
is
our
court.
the
supreme
court
was
conceived
by
those
who
drafted
the
constitution
to
be
the
court
of
the
state
under
these
circumstances
as
we
come
here,
again,
the
urgency
of
the
matter.
the
urgency
of
the
matter
which
rest
upon
the
fact
that
this
polluters,
dow
chemical
principally
dow
chemical
of
canada
has
introduced
into
the
sarnia
river
beginning
in
1949
and
proceeding
up
to
and
including
the
present
amounts
of
mercury
known
to
be
a
poison
and
they
have
done
this
at
a
rate
which
they
admit
to
have
been
as
much
as
200
pounds
in
one
day
and
at
an
average
rate
of
30
pounds
a
day.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
well,
problems
immense
and
the
people
are
concerned.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
true.
i
believe
there
is
another
problem.
the
connection
between
dow
and
u.s.
maybe
easily
proved
that
connection
between
dow
and
ohio
may
not
be
so
easily
proved.
in
other
words,
we
can
get
a
connection
between
dow
of
canada
which
would
justify
a
court
in
saying
that
we
have
proper
service,
also
a
question
which
will
have
to
arrive
at
a
later
date.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
the
problem
of
personal
service
is
here,
better
handled
than
there.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
no
sir,
we
have
brought
an
action
common
pleas
court
of
ohio
against
one
who
is
charged
with
being
a
polluter
in
ohio,
the
bitrex
who
is
also
a
producer
of
chlorine
and
caustic
soda
using
this
mercury
cell
method.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
their
case
is
different,
vastly
different
and
that
we
have
found
they
are
not
a
substantial
polluter
and
that
there's
no
factual
background.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
we
could
not
have
because
then
we
would
not
have
the
jurisdiction
here.
we
can
address
ourselves
here
only
to
residence
of
other
states
or
to
foreign
residence.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
deitrick
is
an
ohio
corporation.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
and
some
of
our
opponents
may
seek
that
to
make
them
parties
to
this
case
but
we
could
not.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
all
of
the
directors
of
dow
canada
or
substantially
all
of
the
directors
of
dow
canada
live
at
midland,
michigan.
so
this
is
another
tie.
the
trail
smelter
case
took
11
years.
it
was
not
under
the
commission
that
reference
--
to
which
reference
is
made,
it
was
under
a
special
commission
and
during
that
11
years
the
trail
smelter
continued
to
pour
sulfur
by
the
ton
into
the
atmosphere
of
the
complaining
state
for
the
entire
11
years.
now,
my
opponent
have
suggested
that
ontario,
canada
is
satisfied
with
the
progress
that's
being
made
to
date
by
dow
company
of
canada
and
i
say
to
you
that
i
have
a
letter
january
12th
here
written
by
the
general
counsel
for
the
ontario
water
resources
to
michigan
--
mr.
paul
w.
brown
sir?
mr.
paul
w.
brown
well,
we
it
in
the
record
the
reference
to
the
report
of
the
commission
indicating
that
dow
of
canada
was
satisfied
with
the
progress
and
i
merely
want
to
respond
to
that
that
they
are
not.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
i'm
sorry.
i
will
say
that
much
of
what
has
been
said
is
factual
and
if
we
get
to
the
factual
part
of
this
case,
we
will
prevail
the
fish
to
which
reference
was
made
which
contained
mercury
can
be
explain
factually.
the
entire
factual
background
of
location
of
fish,
content
of
mercury,
its
poisonous
quality
and
characteristics
whether
or
not
they
were
known
or
should’ve
been
known,
all
can
be
thoroughly
covered
and
i
have
it
and
i'm
ready
to
present.
the
case
is
being
well
prepared.
ohio
wants
the
opportunity
factually
to
give
this
case
to
this
court.
it
is
a
big
case,
it
deserves
a
big
court.
these
men
desperately
want
to
avoid
as
polluters
being
brought
before
this
court.
i
say
to
you
that
all
of
the
resources
of
the
state
of
ohio
that
can
be
brought
to
bear
upon
preparation
of
this
case
factually
are
already
meshed
and
proceeding
and
it
will
be
presented.
a
master
can
do
find
job
of
it
if
all
we
got
from
this
court
ultimately
into
decree
where
a
final
order
barring
any
further
pollution
of
mercury
it
would
be
a
fine
thing.
and
if
you
added
to
that
money
damages
to
punish
these
polluters
for
putting
into
the
great
lakes
water
this
deadly
poison
which
is
not
an
ordinary
pollution,
we
would’ve
accomplish
something
which
would
be
a
deterrent
for
all
other
polluters.
i
say
to
you
they
are
still
polluting,
i
say
to
you
the
pollutant
--
the
mercury
that
they
put
into
the
lake
still
being
acted
upon
by
biological
forces
which
are
making
it
more
and
more
deadly.
and
i
say
there
is
an
emergency
that
will
not
occasion
too
much
difficulty
and
a
master
could
well
handle
this
matter.
thank
you.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
have
here
a
case
which
involves
mercury
pollution
in
the
great
lakes,
an
immense
problem
which
has
become
more
max
as
we
have
factually
realized
that
the
mercury
pollution
is
extremely
damaging
to
health
and
life
of
our
citizens.
now,
we
address
this
action
to
the
original
jurisdiction
to
this
court
under
article
iii,
section
2,
cl.
2
of
the
constitution
and
we
think
that
the
court
has
in
an
exceedingly
clear
way
outlined
the
cases
in
which
such
an
action
is
proper.
we
think
the
georgia
versus
the
tennessee
copper
company
is
extremely
in
point
and
the
new
jersey
versus
new
york
is
extremely
in
point
and
that
each
of
these
cases
provide
in
a
similar
factual
situation
that
this
court
will
hear
a
complaint
so
addressed
by
a
state
against
the
citizens
of
another
state
and
against
the
residence
of
a
foreign
country.
in
each
instance,
the
factual
--
the
facts
are
identical
in
that.
acts
were
committed
the
situs
of
which
was
outside
of
the
complaining
state
but
which
created
a
nuisance
within
the
state
and
this
court
intervened
for
the
purpose
of
enjoining.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
in
the
tennessee
case,
i
think
it
applied
the
common
law
of
the
--
mr.
paul
w.
brown
the
common
--
no,
the
common
law
of
the
state
of
georgia.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
it
seems
to
me
that
here
we
must.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
it
seems
to
here
it
hasn’t
occurred
to
me
that
we
could
apply
in
this
case
anything
except
the
common
law
of
the
state
of
ohio
where
the
nuisance
occurred.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
no,
we
are
not
claiming
under
a
federal
statute.
we
are
claiming
under
the
federal
constitution
the
right
to
file.
we
have
no
federal
question
here.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
we
are
not
stating
a
federal
cause
of
action,
we
are
filing
this
under
the
common
law
of
the
state
of
ohio
and
addressing
our
complaint
as
was
done
in
these
other
two
cases
--
mr.
paul
w.
brown
no
sir,
it
does
not.
if
it
does
it
wasn’t
intended
that
it
should.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
a
common
law
--
mr.
paul
w.
brown
right
and
our
right
to
do
so,
arises
from
the
constitution
and
from
these
two
cases
and
only
from
that.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
i
think
you're
obligated
to
apply
ohio
common
law
with
regard
to
whether
or
not
this
constitutes
a
nuisance
and
i
think
you're
obligated
to
apply
ohio
common
law
with
regard
to
questions
of
damages
which
may
arise
in
the
case.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
yes.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
it
does.
i
have
been
appointed
special
counsel
by
my
successor
to
come
here
and
argue
the
case
at
this
time.
we
desperately
want
it
to
be
maintained,
we
think
this
is
our
only
forum.
we
think
that
if
we
go
to
a
lower
federal
court,
we
are
confronted
by
the
fact
that
we
do
not
have
a
federal
question
nor
do
we
have
diversity
of
citizenship.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
we
do
not
fall
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
but
there
is
no
other
except
our
state
court
and
the
purpose
for
including
in
the
constitution.
the
requirement
the
state
might
come
here
for
original
jurisdiction
or
so
that
we
might
not
have
to
do
exactly
that.
that
we
might
not
have
to
confront
our
adversaries
in
their
court,
in
their
state
court
with
this
question
which
is
so
important
--
mr.
paul
w.
brown
in
their
state
court,
in
our
state
court
also
we
could.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
we
could.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
we
felt
that
the
purpose
for
including
in
the
federal
constitution
the
requirement,
the
right,
this
forum
as
original
jurisdiction,
was
so
that
this
would
not
be
necessary
between
the
state
and
the
citizens
of
another
state.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
it
is
not
explicit.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
no.
no,
we
could
sue
in
our
own
state
and
we
could
of
course
sue
in
the
foreign
forum,
but
we
take
the
posture
that
we
do
not
need
to
as
georgia
did
not
need
to
or
as
new
jersey
did
not
need
to.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
i
think
it’s
ours
and
i
think
this
court
has
already
defined
the
cases
in
which
he
will
hear
such
cases.
the
massachusetts
versus
mellon
case
outlines
the
factual
situation
which
is
again
identical
to
ours
and
that
is
one
where
we
are
filing
suit
in
our
proprietary
capacity
and
we
are
protecting
our
citizens
in
their
rights
to
air,
water,
and
land
and
of
course
anyone
who
argues
as
do
our
opponents
in
their
brief
that
we
do
not
hold
title
or
we
are
not
to
be
fires
of
ohio
land
and
water
for
this
purpose
are
entering
into
a
legal
quibble.
we
feel
that
we
are
properly
here,
we
feel
that
this
court
has
carefully
defined
in
the
two
cases
cited
--
georgia
versus
tennessee
and
also
in
new
jersey
versus
new
york
that
this
is
a
proper
court.
we
think
that
except
from
our
own
court,
it
is
the
only
we
have
no
federal
court
available
to
us
except
this
court
and
we
think
that
the
concern
of
the
people
of
ohio
and
each
people
of
the
great
lakes
district
with
the
ecology
of
the
great
lakes
is
so
real
that
this
court
ought
to
grant
our
motion.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
we’ve
made
our
prayer
quite
general
issue
(inaudible)
observed.
i
think
we
ought
to
go
in
--
we’ve
asked
for
an
injunction,
we've
asked
for
damages
in
lieu
of
that
and
we've
asked
for
compensatory
damages.
we
feel
that
under
the
cases
that
we've
read,
we
are
entitled
to
all
of
these
things
or
some
of
them
at
least
if
for
some
reason
we
can't
enjoin
further,
dumping
of
mercury,
metallic
mercury
into
the
detroit
and
st.
clair
river
then
--
and
if
that
metallic
mercury
which
has
been
placed
in
the
river
by
the
defendants,
polluters
here
with
no
other
status
than
polluters
who
have
within
three
or
four
days
after
discovering
that
they
should
not
pollute
found
ways
of
substantially
reducing
the
pollution.
if
we
cannot
get
injunction
and
removal
then
we
think
we
have
very
properly
asked
this
court
for
damages
and
we
think
that
we
asked
for
damages
for
two
purposes.
one,
to
give
ohio
in
money
those
things
that
it
has
lost
which
are
its
natural
resources
and
belong
to
all
of
its
people.
and
two
and
i
think
this
is
most
important
to
say
the
polluters
generally
who
are
not
fearful
of
injunctions
because
they
continue
to
produce
and
continue
to
pollute
until
they
are
enjoined
from
so
doing.
but
to
say
to
them
in
the
future,
damages
will
be
awarded
for
the
state
or
its
natural
resources
in
those
instances
where
you
have
placed
into
the
public
water
and
air,
commodities
which
can
be
removed
if
it
only
with
the
great
difficulty.
we
rather
enjoy
being
confronted
by
the
defendant
saying
it’s
impractical
for
us
to
remove
this
mercury
from
the
river
the
st.
clair
and
the
detroit
river.
we
don’t
believe
it
is
because
metallic
mercury
there
in
the
river
is
at
the
point
where
it
was
discharged
into
the
river
by
dow
canada
has
been
tested
and
checked
in
it
comes
to
1,400
to
1,800
parts
per
million
of
metallic
mercury
still
embedded
in
the
slime
and
industrial
debris
at
the
bottom
of
that
river,
it’s
there.
the
thing
that
we've
learned
in
the
last
few
years
is
that
this
metallic
mercury
by
the
action
of
the
small
living
animals
in
the
bottom
of
that
sludge.
in
the
absence
of
oxygen
are
able
to
convert
metallic
mercury
into
mercury
which
can
be
assumed
that
would
--
and
which
enters
the
food
change
and
this
of
course
is
what
was
discovered
in
1969
which
brought
about
the
order
from
both
ohio
and
from
ontario
that
fishing
be
stopped
in
the
lakes
because
it
was
discovered
that
more
than
50%
of
the
fish
tested
exceeded
mercury
content
of
0.5
parts
per
million
in
a
ratable
portions.
now,
some
of
them
exceeded
this
by
so
much
that
it
is
dirt
line,
fearsome
and
dangerous
because
some
of
the
more
8
parts
per
million
of
mercury
--
methyl
mercury
in
the
flesh
of
these
fish
and
some
of
them
in
lake
st.
clair
where
as
much
as
10
parts
per
million.
now,
in
japan
where
they
had
116
deaths
for
severe
neurological
damage
from
which
arose
from
the
fact
the
people
in
minamata
bay
area
where
consuming
fish
arose
in
instances
where
the
fish
had
only
double
that
amount,
only
double
that
amount
and
the
deaths
that
occurred
and
the
neurological
damage
that
occurred
was
so
severe
that
they
were
included
in
those
number
16
cases
of
children
who
were
born
with
birth
defects
because
of
the
inclusion
of
this
methyl
mercury
in
their
food.
now
we
are
--
sir?
mr.
paul
w.
brown
i
think
the
right
already
exists
for
--
if
i
understand
your
question
for
ohio
to
ask
for
damages
against
those
who
polluted
in
this
instance
--
mr.
paul
w.
brown
this
is
under
the
state
common
law
sir.
we
don’t
have
a
federal
law.
there
is
no
federal
law
on
this
--
there
is
no
federal
bar
to
this
action.
this
is
argued
in
the
briefs
of
dolan
and
not
in
the
brief
of
wyandotte.
wyandotte
admits
that
there
is
no
federal
bar
that
neither
the
treaty
nor
the
international
commission
bars
our
action.
the
solicitor
general
agrees
with
us
that
there
is
no
federal
bar.
the
solicitor
general
i
think
will
argue
this
in
detail
and
i
leave
part
of
this
to
him
for
that
purpose,
but
there
is
no
bar
that
we’re
properly
within
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
and
that
the
only
question
and
that
we
are
here
as
a
proprietor
and
we
are
seeking
damages
for
all
the
people
and
that
these
cases
every
case
here
reflects
our
rights
so
--
mr.
paul
w.
brown
sir?
mr.
paul
w.
brown
we
seek
damages,
yes
sir
for
the
state’s
right
as
a
proprietor
of
its
natural
resources
for
all
of
its
people.
now,
you
do
have
and
you
have
decided
cases
which
are
cited
in
the
defendant’s
brief
and
which
this
court
did
not
take
original
jurisdiction
in
cases
and
which
the
damages
were
sought
for
a
particular
group
of
people
and
those
cases
do
not
apply
here
because
our
address
our
plaintiff
--
mr.
paul
w.
brown
we
do
have
one
already
sir.
the
action
is
there
for
damages.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
there
is
one
there
sir
and
we
could
use
it
except
under
the
constitution
we’re
entitled
to
bring
our
action
in
this
court
and
i
feel
that
this
--
mr.
paul
w.
brown
it’s
article
iii
of
the
constitution
section
2
cl.
2
of
federal
constitution
and
there
is
a
28
united
states
code
annotated.
there
is
--
this
right
is
formalize
in
the
federal
statute
that
says,
--
mr.
paul
w.
brown
yes.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
i
don’t
agree.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
i
do
not
agree.
the
work
“discretion”
occurs
in
a
footnote
in
the
solicitor
general’s
brief.
the
real
way
this
court
should
determine
whether
or
not
it
accepts
is
either
is
to
follow
the
guidelines
which
have
already
been
set
up
by
this
court
in
massachusetts
versus
mellon
in
which
this
court
said
that
the
state
merely
had
--
merely
being
a
party
did
not
give
a
right
to
come
in
here.
it
must
also
have
a
justiciable
lawsuit
and
we
have
such,
we
have
a
lawsuit.
it
doesn’t
fall
within
any
of
the
cases
in
which
in
this
court
in
which
a
state
has
been
precluded
from
action
and
it
does
fall
within
those
on
the
right
side
of
the
jurisdictional
guidelines
which
were
drawn
by
this
court
and
very
clearly
stated
in
massachusetts
versus
mellon.
there
are
some
other
cases
which
the
defendant
argues
which
do
not
apply.
the
defendants
in
this
case
have
set
up
a
number
of
strong
men.
they
as
polluters
have
tried
desperately
to
use
every
measure
to
continue
to
pollute.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
these
are
factual
questions
which
we
would
get
to
in
the
merits.
but
we
do
not
think
they
have
seized
to
pollute.
in
fact,
we
have
indications
that
canada
does
not
think
that
they
have
seized
to
pollute
and
that
canada
is
about
to
file
further
judicial
action
there
against
dow.
now
we
have
this
--
mr.
paul
w.
brown
i
think
this
is
a
ploy
that
polluters
generally
use.
in
other
words,
when
you
catch
me,
i
will
stop.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
they
are
still
introducing
mercury
to
the
water,
they
admitted
at
least
to
the
point
of
half
of
pound
a
day.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
i
think
it
should
be
a
matter
for
the
special
master.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
if
we
fail
to
prove
our
case
then
of
course
we
will
lose,
but
we
have
to
prove
that
they
not
only
have
polluted
but
the
pollution
continues.
in
addition
to
this,
metallic
mercury
concentrated
at
the
point
which
the
effluent
is
dumped
into
the
river
by
dow
and
by
wyandotte
it
is
still
there
on
the
bottom
of
the
river
and
it’s
still
being
leached
away
by
the
passage
of
water
there
over
it,
and
is
still
being
acted
upon
by
the
bacteria
throughout
the
lakes
so
that
you
continue
to
get
pollution
which
was
cause
and
brought
about
by
their
original
action.
in
addition
to
that,
this
proceeding
is
going
to
be
--
have
to
be
constantly
monitored
because
the
amount
of
sewage
and
other
industrial
waste
that
is
in
the
lake
made
by
other
changes
began
to
react
upon
this
metallic
mercury
at
an
ever
increasing
rate
so
that
we
may
get
a
higher
rate
of
mercury
pollution
in
the
fish
themselves
without
the
addition
of
any
additional
mercury.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
we
believe
we
can
show
that
the
chlor-alkali
process
of
making
caustic
soda
and
the
chlorine
is
the
process
which
provides
by
far
the
greatest
percentage
in
amount
of
this
particular
pollutant
mercury.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
no
other,
there
are.
we
believe
the
evidence
would
clearly
show
there
are
no
other
substantial
polluters
that
these
people
are
the
only
substantial
polluters
in
this
particular
area
and
we
believe
that
if
there
are
other
substantial
polluters
we
would
be
delighted
to
have
the
defendants
make
the
parties
after
wherein
here
on
the
merits.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
it
does
go
to
the
merits
and
i
am
afraid
that
--
mr.
paul
w.
brown
right
and
i
am
afraid
that
the
judgment
with
regard
to
our
motion
may
turn
upon
your
anticipation
of
what
the
merits
are
and
hence,
i
must
strongly
state
that
the
facts
are
with
us
and
against
our
opponents.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
that’s
right.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
right.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
you’ll
have
to
write
some
new
law
if
you
want
to
exercise
discretion
in
this
case.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
right.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
right
now,
i
was
going
to
supreme
court
of
ohio
and
we
have
the
same
complaint
made
to
us.
we
were
final
and
hence,
we
had
a
certain
discretion.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
but
under
the
cases
which
have
been
written
and
under
the
constitution
and
laws
on
the
books,
we
are
entitled
to
be
here
and
the
only
question
that
i
would
have
any
difficulty
with
answering
is
the
question
of
the
exact
shape
and
form
of
the
final
decree
in
this
court,
which
is
also
something
we
must
reach
when
we
develop
all
the
factual
background.
now,
what
ohio
wants
to
do
--
mr.
paul
w.
brown
that’s
all
there
is
before
us,
sir.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
it
seems
to
me
(voice
overlap)
if
we
address
our
--
mr.
paul
w.
brown
it
said
that
we
had
to
be
a
party
and
in
additional
we
had
to
have
lawsuit,
it’s
exactly
what
it
said.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
when
we
are
a
party
and
we
do
have
a
lawsuit.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
it
affects
individuals
and
groups
differently
then
it
affects
the
public
generally
but
this
has
never
been
a
test
under
any
case
that
i
read.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
it
does.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
it
has
unique
position
factually
with
regard
to
injury
and
that
80%
of
the
fish,
if
we’re
going
to
discuss
that
80%
of
the
fish
are
in
the
ohio
waters.
most
--
mr.
paul
w.
brown
we
filed
motion
intended
to
petition.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
well,
there
is
something
else
you
can
do
sir
and
i
beg
your
pardon
if
you
gather
that
i
say
nothing
that
you
have
no
discretion.
of
course
you
have
an
existing
discretion
to
deny
any
case
and
there
would
be
nothing
i,
as
an
applicant
to
the
court
could
do
about
it
because
the
finality
of
your
judgment.
but
mr.
justice
stewart
has
said
exactly
what
i
think
my
position
is
and
that
is
the
constitution
is
clear,
the
federal
statute
is
clear
and
the
cases
that
this
court
has
here
before
decided
are
clear
and
those
which
we've
cited
say
we
have
a
right
in
these
particular
facts
to
address
ourselves
to
your
court
in
this
way.
and
those
which
have
denied
this
court
to
others
for
reasons
which
have
been
stated,
those
reasons
do
not
apply
to
us
or
to
our
action.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
we
could
not
and
there
is
an
amicus
briefs
filed
by
the
attorney
general
(voice
overlap).
mr.
paul
w.
brown
sir,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
right.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
and
this
was
raised
also
by
kelly
from
michigan
the
attorney
general
who
joined
with
us
as
amicus
been
sought
this
court
to
intervene.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
we
could
file
in
a
common
pleas
court
in
the
state
of
ohio
but
because
we
have
the
right
as
we
view
it
under
the
constitution
to
say
this
is
our
court.
the
supreme
court
was
conceived
by
those
who
drafted
the
constitution
to
be
the
court
of
the
state
under
these
circumstances
as
we
come
here,
again,
the
urgency
of
the
matter.
the
urgency
of
the
matter
which
rest
upon
the
fact
that
this
polluters,
dow
chemical
principally
dow
chemical
of
canada
has
introduced
into
the
sarnia
river
beginning
in
1949
and
proceeding
up
to
and
including
the
present
amounts
of
mercury
known
to
be
a
poison
and
they
have
done
this
at
a
rate
which
they
admit
to
have
been
as
much
as
200
pounds
in
one
day
and
at
an
average
rate
of
30
pounds
a
day.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
well,
problems
immense
and
the
people
are
concerned.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
true.
i
believe
there
is
another
problem.
the
connection
between
dow
and
u.s.
maybe
easily
proved
that
connection
between
dow
and
ohio
may
not
be
so
easily
proved.
in
other
words,
we
can
get
a
connection
between
dow
of
canada
which
would
justify
a
court
in
saying
that
we
have
proper
service,
also
a
question
which
will
have
to
arrive
at
a
later
date.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
the
problem
of
personal
service
is
here,
better
handled
than
there.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
no
sir,
we
have
brought
an
action
common
pleas
court
of
ohio
against
one
who
is
charged
with
being
a
polluter
in
ohio,
the
bitrex
who
is
also
a
producer
of
chlorine
and
caustic
soda
using
this
mercury
cell
method.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
their
case
is
different,
vastly
different
and
that
we
have
found
they
are
not
a
substantial
polluter
and
that
there's
no
factual
background.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
we
could
not
have
because
then
we
would
not
have
the
jurisdiction
here.
we
can
address
ourselves
here
only
to
residence
of
other
states
or
to
foreign
residence.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
deitrick
is
an
ohio
corporation.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
and
some
of
our
opponents
may
seek
that
to
make
them
parties
to
this
case
but
we
could
not.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
all
of
the
directors
of
dow
canada
or
substantially
all
of
the
directors
of
dow
canada
live
at
midland,
michigan.
so
this
is
another
tie.
the
trail
smelter
case
took
11
years.
it
was
not
under
the
commission
that
reference
--
to
which
reference
is
made,
it
was
under
a
special
commission
and
during
that
11
years
the
trail
smelter
continued
to
pour
sulfur
by
the
ton
into
the
atmosphere
of
the
complaining
state
for
the
entire
11
years.
now,
my
opponent
have
suggested
that
ontario,
canada
is
satisfied
with
the
progress
that's
being
made
to
date
by
dow
company
of
canada
and
i
say
to
you
that
i
have
a
letter
january
12th
here
written
by
the
general
counsel
for
the
ontario
water
resources
to
michigan
--
mr.
paul
w.
brown
sir?
mr.
paul
w.
brown
well,
we
it
in
the
record
the
reference
to
the
report
of
the
commission
indicating
that
dow
of
canada
was
satisfied
with
the
progress
and
i
merely
want
to
respond
to
that
that
they
are
not.
mr.
paul
w.
brown
i'm
sorry.
i
will
say
that
much
of
what
has
been
said
is
factual
and
if
we
get
to
the
factual
part
of
this
case,
we
will
prevail
the
fish
to
which
reference
was
made
which
contained
mercury
can
be
explain
factually.
the
entire
factual
background
of
location
of
fish,
content
of
mercury,
its
poisonous
quality
and
characteristics
whether
or
not
they
were
known
or
should’ve
been
known,
all
can
be
thoroughly
covered
and
i
have
it
and
i'm
ready
to
present.
the
case
is
being
well
prepared.
ohio
wants
the
opportunity
factually
to
give
this
case
to
this
court.
it
is
a
big
case,
it
deserves
a
big
court.
these
men
desperately
want
to
avoid
as
polluters
being
brought
before
this
court.
i
say
to
you
that
all
of
the
resources
of
the
state
of
ohio
that
can
be
brought
to
bear
upon
preparation
of
this
case
factually
are
already
meshed
and
proceeding
and
it
will
be
presented.
a
master
can
do
find
job
of
it
if
all
we
got
from
this
court
ultimately
into
decree
where
a
final
order
barring
any
further
pollution
of
mercury
it
would
be
a
fine
thing.
and
if
you
added
to
that
money
damages
to
punish
these
polluters
for
putting
into
the
great
lakes
water
this
deadly
poison
which
is
not
an
ordinary
pollution,
we
would’ve
accomplish
something
which
would
be
a
deterrent
for
all
other
polluters.
i
say
to
you
they
are
still
polluting,
i
say
to
you
the
pollutant
--
the
mercury
that
they
put
into
the
lake
still
being
acted
upon
by
biological
forces
which
are
making
it
more
and
more
deadly.
and
i
say
there
is
an
emergency
that
will
not
occasion
too
much
difficulty
and
a
master
could
well
handle
this
matter.
thank
you.
