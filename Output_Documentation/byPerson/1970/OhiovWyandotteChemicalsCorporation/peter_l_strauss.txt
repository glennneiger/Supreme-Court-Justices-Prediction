mr.
peter
l.
strauss
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
has
filed
its
brief
amicus
curiae
and
appears
here
today
an
invitation
of
this
court
and
as
the
court
knows
from
our
brief
we
express
no
view
that
whether
in
this
particular
case,
the
court
should
as
a
matter
of
discretion
grant
lead
to
ohio
to
file
its
complaint
and
i
may
suggest
that
perhaps
i
really
have
a
very
little
to
talk
about
since
the
party
is
do
seem
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
i
find
none
and
i
think
one
thing
that
might
have
been
mentioned.
i
find
no
doubt.
and
one
thing
which
might
have
been
mentioned
while
there
are
these
prior
cases
which
point
in
very
much
the
same
direction
as
ohio’s
complaint
to
the
new
jersey
versus
new
york
city
and
particularly
--
and
in
particular
has
a
remarkable
factual
congruence
with
the
asserted
facts
of
the
complaint
here.
those
cases
were
all
decided
before
the
present
federal
statutes
and
before
the
prominence
at
least
of
perhaps
certain
matters
under
the
boundary
waters
treaty
weren’t
relevant
to
that
in
any
event
in
this
court
in
its
opinions
in
those
cases
albeit
after
the
merits
have
been
decided
was
quite
emphatic
about
how
they’d
rather
have.
the
federal
statutes
or
some
kind
of
conference
procedures
or
something
of
the
sort
and
it
seemed
incumbent
upon
us
to
address
ourselves
as
we
have
in
our
brief
to
the
question
whether
indeed
those
statutes
foreclose
the
remedy
in
this
court.
and
to
give
the
court
the
types
of
information
that
it
might
wish
to
use
in
exercising
that
discretion.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
suppose
what
we’re
speaking
of
here
is
the
case
that's
not
only
within
this
court’s
original
jurisdiction
but
also
within
the
original
jurisdiction
of
another
court
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
--
that
when
the
court’s
jurisdiction
is
exclusive
and
original,
the
court
quite
properly
could
be
said
not
to
have
jurisdiction
but
when
it
believes
that
there’re
may
be
a
remedy
in
another
court
something
on
the
order
of
doctrine
of
forum
non
conveniens
at
which
i
think
quite
appropriately
takes
into
account
the
other
responsibilities
that
this
court
has
and
its
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that’s
right,
its
capacity
to
sit
as
a
finder
of
fact
which
is
called
on
to
be
and
on
the
other
side
you
do
have
the
aspects
that
mr.
brown
was
speaking
of
its
appointment
really
as
a
court
before
the
state
and
you
do
have
one
of
the
states
(voice
overlap).
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
somewhat
similar
to
that
i
think
the
considerations
are
different.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
the
question.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
think
there
one
has
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
there
one
has
certain
considerations
of
federalism
which
are
quite
important.
there's
been
some
discussion
this
morning
about
the
capacity
of
this
court
is
distinct
from
an
ohio
court
to
determine
ohio
law
and
that
certainly
is
a
relevant
factor.
now,
i
may
say
that
i
think
there
may
be
--
that
may
turn
out
to
be
somewhat
more
dispute
about
the
actual
jurisdiction
of
this
court
than
does
appear
from
the
papers
in
their
present
state.
and
in
particular
with
respect
to
the
jurisdiction
over
dow
chemical
of
canada
and
that’s
the
principal
matter
i
intend
to
talk
about
this
morning.
it
is
agreed
that
the
questions
of
personal
jurisdiction
and
service
of
process
are
not
yet
raised
similarly
any
questions
about
indispensable
parties.
and
issues
of
that
sort
would
have
to
await
decision
of
a
later
time
and
it
does
seem
to
be
general
agreement
that
injunctive
relief
at
least
would
be
within
the
court’s
power
to
order,
although
there
are
some
dispute
again
with
regard
to
the
canadian
defendant.
so
i
don’t
feel
i
have
to
spend
much
time
on
the
wyandotte
corporation’s
claim.
they
addressed
themselves
only
to
the
federal
water
quality
statutes
and
in
this
respect
i
simply
want
to
restate
what’s
said
out
in
much
greater
length
in
our
brief.
what
are
certainly
from
ohio’s
point
of
view
and
i
think
in
terms
of
the
relief
it’s
asked
from
this
court.
realistically,
deficiencies
in
those
remedies
which
the
court
ought
to
--
ought
very
much
to
bear
in
mind.
in
particular,
the
remedy
is
prospective
only,
it
operates
only
as
a
means
of
stopping
future
pollution
and
it’s
heavily
laden
with
the
administrative
delay
besides,
except
for
oil
which
is
dealt
with
in
a
separate
provision
33
u.s.c.
section
1161.
the
act
imposes
no
obligation
on
someone
who
has
polluted
in
the
past
to
remove
the
polluting
substances
which
he
has
introduced
into
the
waters
or
to
bear
responsibility
for
the
damages
which
those
substances
of
course
but
leaves
those
matters
to
the
courts
or
to
other
agencies
to
a
suit
such
as
this
one.
an
injunctive
remedy
for
nuisance
is
common
in
this
court’s
original
jurisdiction
as
its
already
been
pointed
out
and
that
it’s
also
clear
that
this
court
could
order
removal
of
a
nuisance
which
would
not
abate
of
its
own
force
as
this
mercury
is
alleged
to
be.
the
court
did
such
a
thing
in
pennsylvania
versus
the
wheeling
bridge
company
in
13
how.
of
its
reports
and
we
think
it
easily
follows
also
from
the
wyandotte
transportation
company
decision
of
a
few
terms
ago
that
removal
might
be
accomplished
by
the
provision
of
the
funds
such
as
ohio
seeks
and
towards
the
defendant
could
pay
moneys
to
be
use
for
that
purpose.
i
may
say,
we
do
have
some
difficulty
with
the
claim
of
ohio
for
compensatory
damages,
but
it
doesn’t
seem
to
us
that
that
claim
is
necessarily
excluded
from
this
court’s
jurisdiction.
in
the
past,
the
court
has
rejected
such
claims
as
mr.
brown
points
out
because
it
was
clear
that
they
were
intended
for
the
benefit
of
particular
individual.
in
north
dakota
versus
minnesota
and
particular
the
state
segregated
its
claim
that
was
$5,000.00
for
us
and
a
million
dollars
for
the
farmers
who
were
paying
the
expenses
of
this
litigation.
there
is
no
such
differentiation
here
and
we
really
don’t
know
how
ohio
intends
to
use
the
money
at
which
it
receives.
it
may
be
remarked
in
the
first
place
that
ohio
has
undoubted
proprietary
interest
here
and
we
can't
say
as
could
be
said
in
north
dakota
case
what
proportion
that
proprietary
interest
bears
to
the
damages
that
might
be
assessed
nor
is
it
excluded
i
think
that
in
assessment
of
damages
could
be
used
in
a
way
that
bears
very
strongly
on
the
nuisance
remedy.
now
the
defendants
makes
a
great
deal
in
their
brief
of
the
difficulty
of
calculating
the
sums
that
would
be
required
to
remove
the
mercury
from
the
lake
bed
and
of
the
enormity
of
that
financial
burden.
i
would
suggest
and
it
has
been
suggested
by
some
commentators
that
an
appropriate
way
of
calculating
monetary
relief
in
such
circumstances
and
perhaps
the
simpler
one
is
to
assess
the
damages
which
have
been
done
and
then
to
use
those
funds
for
that
removal
purpose
and
certainly
it
doesn’t
seem
to
me
excluded
on
the
complaint
that
that’s
what
ohio
would
do.
certainly,
it
ought
not
to
be
the
case
but
because
the
one
level
of
funds
is
so
hard
to
compute
in
so
amount
--
and
so
amends
in
amount
that
the
polluter
should
simply
go
away
scot-free.
and
finally,
i
would
point
out
in
this
regard
that
if
ohio
were
using
the
funds
in
this
particular
way
as
a
means
of
remedying
the
nuisance
it
couldn’t
be
claimed
as
the
defendants
do
that
there
were
some
risk
of
double
recovery
because
although
the
measure
might
be
the
same
as
could
be
obtained
in
the
suit
brought
by
an
individual.
the
use
and
the
remedy
would
be
entirely
different.
i
come
now
to
the
principal
area
of
controversy
of
importance
to
the
united
states
and
that
is
the
possible
liability
of
dow
chemical
of
canada
or
of
its
parent
dow
chemical
company
for
acts
done
at
the
company’s
canadian
factory
whose
effects
are
felt
in
the
united
states.
now
these
two
companies
appear
quite
strongly
to
insist
that
any
assertion
of
jurisdiction
by
this
court
might
provoke
in
international
incident
or
undercut
in
international
treaty
and
we
want
to
make
it
claim
that
it’s
the
view
of
the
united
states
that
no
such
consequences
would
occur.
the
power
of
american
courts
to
redress
torts
whose
effects
are
felt
on
american
soil
is
we
believe
indisputable.
the
company
has
also
raised
certain
doubts
regarding
whether
the
court
could
provide
an
effective
remedy.
this
goes
essentially
to
matters
of
discretion
but
we
do
point
out
certain
respects
in
which
more
facts
are
needed
before
a
final
conclusion
can
be
reach.
let
me
begin
with
the
issue
of
liability,
i
think
all
of
us
would
agree
on
a
simple
case
in
which
issues
of
causation
are
not
obscure
in
case
of
the
individual
who
is
standing
on
one
side
of
niagara
river
fires
a
rifle
across
it
and
it
kills
the
person
on
the
other
side.
the
person
--
if
the
state
in
which
the
individual
was
murdered
is
able
to
secure
jurisdiction
over
the
person
of
the
sniper.
and
that
of
course
is
not
a
question
that’s
here
today.
there
could
be
no
dispute
of
its
power
to
try
him
for
murder.
international
law
recognizes
that
right
and
i
don’t
think
the
party
seriously
contests
it.
the
situation
is
the
same
if
instead
of
sending
a
rifle
bullet
he
sends
sludge
which
causes
a
public
nuisance
on
the
other
side
of
the
river.
again,
to
the
extent
that
a
public
nuisance
may
be
prosecuted
as
a
crime
--
there
could
be
no
dispute
that
the
recipient
state
may
prosecute
the
individual
if
it
may
obtain
service
on
him
before
that
crime.
a
canadian
court
would
feel
as
competent
as
an
american
court
in
those
circumstances
and
the
only
way
an
international
incident
could
arise
would
be
if
some
improper
means
have
been
used
to
secure
jurisdiction
of
the
defendant
or
a
due
process
where
somehow
denied
in
the
course
of
the
trial
and
both
of
which
we
are
quite
certain
will
not
happen
in
this
proceedings.
there
might
be
some
question
whether
a
judicial
decree
obtained
in
civil
proceedings
would
be
enforceable
in
the
courts
of
the
other
jurisdiction.
and
that
is
--
we
don’t
--
we
think
it
should
be
quite
clear
to
this
court
that
if
it
ultimately
does
grant
relief
a
judgment
to
ohio
then
judgment
will
then
be
ohio
is
to
enforce
as
part
of
the
same
situation
and
ohio
may
indeed
have
some
difficulty
in
enforcing
that
judgment
in
canadian
court.
and
that's
a
matter
to
where
trouble
return
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
in
canada,
excuse
me.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
so
far
as
enforcement
to
the
judgment
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that’s
right.
the
suggestion
is
made
that
the
fact
that
this
is
a
public
nuisance
suit
here
makes
a
difference.
i
think
the
argument
is
essentially
that
only
the
united
states
could
bring
an
action
for
public
nuisance
against
a
person
who
is
resident
in
a
foreign
country
and
producing
his
nuisance
from
that
point.
as
if
only
the
united
states
could
prosecute
the
sniper
on
the
banks
of
the
niagara
river
or
a
murder
which
he
causes
in
new
york
state,
i
think
to
state
the
proposition
in
that
way
is
to
answer
under
the
constitution.
the
states
are
forbidden
from
engaging
in
diplomacy
but
ohio
doesn’t
seek
to
involve
the
canadian
government
in
any
respect
in
this
case.
it
charges
an
offense
to
its
domestic
laws
felt
on
its
own
soil
against
the
particular
individual
who
may
or
may
not
be
within
its
power
to
bring
to
justice
and
if
the
individual
is
within
its
power.
it
is
only
because
it
is
available
to
domestic
service
of
process.
canada
need
never
be
consulted
in
its
territory
is
never
entered
upon.
ohio
obtains
the
judgment
and
seeks
to
have
it
enforced
as
i
said
before
if
it
must
take
it
to
canada,
canadian
courts
will
then
decide
what
recognition
to
give
the
judgment.
that
will
be
a
canadian
domestic
matter.
there
are
of
course
alternative
ways
of
dealing
with
the
situation.
ohio
might
have
come
to
the
united
states
and
requested
the
united
states
to
take
this
matter
up
with
the
canadian
government
as
a
diplomatic
matter.
that
was
done
in
the
case
prominently
mentioned
in
the
briefs
the
trail
smelter
case
in
british
columbia.
but
this
is
merely
an
alternative
on
a
required
motive
proceeding
and
as
we
said
out
at
length
in
our
brief,
the
boundary
waters
treaty
of
1909
provides
no
mechanism
for
the
mandatory
resolution
of
pollution
disputes
concerning
boundary
waters.
in
this
connection,
i
think
i
ought
to
correct
a
misapprehension
which
dow
chemical
of
united
states
at
least
have
with
regard
to
the
boundary
waters
treaty.
they
twice
mentioned
article
ii
of
the
treaty
as
if
it
had
some
bearing
on
this
case
may
be
found
at
page
3-a
and
4-a
of
the
brief
of
dow
chemical
of
canada.
that
article
applies,
well
i
think
and
perhaps
the
quickest
way
to
do
this
is
to
suggest
the
three
different
sorts
of
--
three
different
situations
that
one
may
have
across
the
canadian-american
boundary.
and
we
have
a
river
that
runs
across
the
boundary
and
may
be
interfered
with
upstream
or
downstream
and
then
one
may
have
waters
like
lake
erie
which
sit
on
the
boundary.
only
waters
on
the
boundary
are
designated
boundary
waters
under
the
treaty.
article
ii
provides
as
to
a
river
which
runs
across
the
boundary
that
if
someone
on
the
upstream
ended
it
interferes
with
its
use
and
that
might
conceivably
include
pollution
although
it
has
never
been
so
adjudicated,
then
and
in
that
circumstance
only
a
downstream
individual
may
come
into
the
courts
of
the
upstream
nation
and
litigate
in
that
forum
the
issue
of
the
damages
which
is
done
to
him
and
is
entitled
to
have
that
litigation
resolve
in
his
favor
under
the
laws
of
that
nation
as
if
he
were
a
citizen
thereof.
now,
that
is
a
specific
remedy
and
if
that
were
applicable
in
this
case,
ohio
would
be
able
to
go
into
the
courts
of
canada
and
get
relief
against
dow
canada.
it’s
not
applicable
here
because
we’re
dealing
with
boundary
waters
not
a
river
which
crosses
the
boundary
and
the
result
is
that
ohio
hasn’t
much
less
certain
remedy,
i
would
say
than
it
would
have
if
article
ii
applied.
nonetheless,
the
failure
of
the
treaty
to
deal
with
that
situation
in
the
view
of
the
united
states
does
not
at
all
exclude
the
possibility
of
the
remedy
which
ohio
is
seeking
today.
the
remedy
which
ohio
is
seeking
is
recognized
an
international
law
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
treaty
which
excludes
it.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
principle
stated
by
this
court
in
new
jersey
versus
new
york
city
is
equally
applicable
here.
if
the
defendant
is
before
the
court
and
i'm
reading
from
page
482
of
volume
283
of
the
court’s
opinion
that
the
defendant
is
before
the
court
in
the
property
of
plaintiff
and
its
citizens
that
is
alleged
to
have
been
injured
by
such
dumping
is
within
the
court’s
territorial
jurisdiction
the
situs
of
the
act
creating
the
nuisance
whether
within
or
without
the
united
states
is
of
no
importance.
and
turn
very
briefly
to
the
problems
of
enforcement
at
which
chiefly
is
i
think
this
court
has
already
recognized
should
await
later
resolution.
the
first
observation
is
that
to
the
extent
money
damages
are
possible
there
is
really
no
issue
about
enforcement
nor
is
there
any
possible
disability
regarding
this
court’s
power
to
give
injunctive
relief
so
far
as
that
injunctive
relief
applies
on
this
side
of
the
boundary.
if
the
court
has
jurisdiction
over
dow
canada’s
person
it
may
enjoin
dow
canada
requiring
it
to
remove
the
mercury
from
the
american
half
of
the
st.
clair
river
or
of
the
detroit
river
or
of
lake
erie
and
there
should
be
no
question
to
this
court’s
power
to
do
that.
there
are
i
think
some
problems
involved
with
granting
injunctive
relief
which
would
necessarily
take
effect
in
canada
or
to
put
--
excuse
me,
to
put
it
in
other
way
which
would
require
that
aid
of
a
canadian
court.
i
think,
if
the
court
wherever
to
conclude
that
that
were
necessary
it
could
fairly
apprehend
that
the
aid
of
a
canadian
court
might
not
be
forthcoming.
but
as
we
understand
its
complaint,
ohio
asked
only
that
dow
be
enjoined
from
producing
the
objective
to
effects
on
the
american
side
of
the
boundary.
and
the
cases
are
legion
which
state
that
such
an
injunction
is
proper
for
an
american
court
to
enter
the
salton
sea
cases,
the
united
states
versus
--
excuse
steele
versus
bulova
watch
company,
vanity
fair
mills
versus
eaton.
all
of
these
cases
quite
clearly
comprehend
that
where
an
effect
is
felt
within
the
united
states,
the
united
states
court
having
jurisdiction
of
the
parties
has
the
authority
to
enter
an
injunction
requiring
that
that
effect
be
seized
and
as
we
understand
that
is
all
that
ohio
seeks
in
this
case.
the
point
is
that
it
begs
the
question
to
state
as
dow
does.
the
dow
chemical
of
canada’s
conduct
has
been
wholly
fund
and
that
therefore
this
court
lacks
jurisdiction
to
correct
it.
on
the
allegations
of
the
complaint,
it
must
be
assumed
that
the
tortious
conduct
is
extended
to
this
country
and
if
that’s
the
case
there
is
no
principle
of
international
law
that
bars
this
court
from
entertaining
ohio
seeking.
thank
you.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
has
filed
its
brief
amicus
curiae
and
appears
here
today
an
invitation
of
this
court
and
as
the
court
knows
from
our
brief
we
express
no
view
that
whether
in
this
particular
case,
the
court
should
as
a
matter
of
discretion
grant
lead
to
ohio
to
file
its
complaint
and
i
may
suggest
that
perhaps
i
really
have
a
very
little
to
talk
about
since
the
party
is
do
seem
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
i
find
none
and
i
think
one
thing
that
might
have
been
mentioned.
i
find
no
doubt.
and
one
thing
which
might
have
been
mentioned
while
there
are
these
prior
cases
which
point
in
very
much
the
same
direction
as
ohio’s
complaint
to
the
new
jersey
versus
new
york
city
and
particularly
--
and
in
particular
has
a
remarkable
factual
congruence
with
the
asserted
facts
of
the
complaint
here.
those
cases
were
all
decided
before
the
present
federal
statutes
and
before
the
prominence
at
least
of
perhaps
certain
matters
under
the
boundary
waters
treaty
weren’t
relevant
to
that
in
any
event
in
this
court
in
its
opinions
in
those
cases
albeit
after
the
merits
have
been
decided
was
quite
emphatic
about
how
they’d
rather
have.
the
federal
statutes
or
some
kind
of
conference
procedures
or
something
of
the
sort
and
it
seemed
incumbent
upon
us
to
address
ourselves
as
we
have
in
our
brief
to
the
question
whether
indeed
those
statutes
foreclose
the
remedy
in
this
court.
and
to
give
the
court
the
types
of
information
that
it
might
wish
to
use
in
exercising
that
discretion.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
suppose
what
we’re
speaking
of
here
is
the
case
that's
not
only
within
this
court’s
original
jurisdiction
but
also
within
the
original
jurisdiction
of
another
court
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
--
that
when
the
court’s
jurisdiction
is
exclusive
and
original,
the
court
quite
properly
could
be
said
not
to
have
jurisdiction
but
when
it
believes
that
there’re
may
be
a
remedy
in
another
court
something
on
the
order
of
doctrine
of
forum
non
conveniens
at
which
i
think
quite
appropriately
takes
into
account
the
other
responsibilities
that
this
court
has
and
its
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that’s
right,
its
capacity
to
sit
as
a
finder
of
fact
which
is
called
on
to
be
and
on
the
other
side
you
do
have
the
aspects
that
mr.
brown
was
speaking
of
its
appointment
really
as
a
court
before
the
state
and
you
do
have
one
of
the
states
(voice
overlap).
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
somewhat
similar
to
that
i
think
the
considerations
are
different.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
the
question.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
think
there
one
has
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
there
one
has
certain
considerations
of
federalism
which
are
quite
important.
there's
been
some
discussion
this
morning
about
the
capacity
of
this
court
is
distinct
from
an
ohio
court
to
determine
ohio
law
and
that
certainly
is
a
relevant
factor.
now,
i
may
say
that
i
think
there
may
be
--
that
may
turn
out
to
be
somewhat
more
dispute
about
the
actual
jurisdiction
of
this
court
than
does
appear
from
the
papers
in
their
present
state.
and
in
particular
with
respect
to
the
jurisdiction
over
dow
chemical
of
canada
and
that’s
the
principal
matter
i
intend
to
talk
about
this
morning.
it
is
agreed
that
the
questions
of
personal
jurisdiction
and
service
of
process
are
not
yet
raised
similarly
any
questions
about
indispensable
parties.
and
issues
of
that
sort
would
have
to
await
decision
of
a
later
time
and
it
does
seem
to
be
general
agreement
that
injunctive
relief
at
least
would
be
within
the
court’s
power
to
order,
although
there
are
some
dispute
again
with
regard
to
the
canadian
defendant.
so
i
don’t
feel
i
have
to
spend
much
time
on
the
wyandotte
corporation’s
claim.
they
addressed
themselves
only
to
the
federal
water
quality
statutes
and
in
this
respect
i
simply
want
to
restate
what’s
said
out
in
much
greater
length
in
our
brief.
what
are
certainly
from
ohio’s
point
of
view
and
i
think
in
terms
of
the
relief
it’s
asked
from
this
court.
realistically,
deficiencies
in
those
remedies
which
the
court
ought
to
--
ought
very
much
to
bear
in
mind.
in
particular,
the
remedy
is
prospective
only,
it
operates
only
as
a
means
of
stopping
future
pollution
and
it’s
heavily
laden
with
the
administrative
delay
besides,
except
for
oil
which
is
dealt
with
in
a
separate
provision
33
u.s.c.
section
1161.
the
act
imposes
no
obligation
on
someone
who
has
polluted
in
the
past
to
remove
the
polluting
substances
which
he
has
introduced
into
the
waters
or
to
bear
responsibility
for
the
damages
which
those
substances
of
course
but
leaves
those
matters
to
the
courts
or
to
other
agencies
to
a
suit
such
as
this
one.
an
injunctive
remedy
for
nuisance
is
common
in
this
court’s
original
jurisdiction
as
its
already
been
pointed
out
and
that
it’s
also
clear
that
this
court
could
order
removal
of
a
nuisance
which
would
not
abate
of
its
own
force
as
this
mercury
is
alleged
to
be.
the
court
did
such
a
thing
in
pennsylvania
versus
the
wheeling
bridge
company
in
13
how.
of
its
reports
and
we
think
it
easily
follows
also
from
the
wyandotte
transportation
company
decision
of
a
few
terms
ago
that
removal
might
be
accomplished
by
the
provision
of
the
funds
such
as
ohio
seeks
and
towards
the
defendant
could
pay
moneys
to
be
use
for
that
purpose.
i
may
say,
we
do
have
some
difficulty
with
the
claim
of
ohio
for
compensatory
damages,
but
it
doesn’t
seem
to
us
that
that
claim
is
necessarily
excluded
from
this
court’s
jurisdiction.
in
the
past,
the
court
has
rejected
such
claims
as
mr.
brown
points
out
because
it
was
clear
that
they
were
intended
for
the
benefit
of
particular
individual.
in
north
dakota
versus
minnesota
and
particular
the
state
segregated
its
claim
that
was
$5,000.00
for
us
and
a
million
dollars
for
the
farmers
who
were
paying
the
expenses
of
this
litigation.
there
is
no
such
differentiation
here
and
we
really
don’t
know
how
ohio
intends
to
use
the
money
at
which
it
receives.
it
may
be
remarked
in
the
first
place
that
ohio
has
undoubted
proprietary
interest
here
and
we
can't
say
as
could
be
said
in
north
dakota
case
what
proportion
that
proprietary
interest
bears
to
the
damages
that
might
be
assessed
nor
is
it
excluded
i
think
that
in
assessment
of
damages
could
be
used
in
a
way
that
bears
very
strongly
on
the
nuisance
remedy.
now
the
defendants
makes
a
great
deal
in
their
brief
of
the
difficulty
of
calculating
the
sums
that
would
be
required
to
remove
the
mercury
from
the
lake
bed
and
of
the
enormity
of
that
financial
burden.
i
would
suggest
and
it
has
been
suggested
by
some
commentators
that
an
appropriate
way
of
calculating
monetary
relief
in
such
circumstances
and
perhaps
the
simpler
one
is
to
assess
the
damages
which
have
been
done
and
then
to
use
those
funds
for
that
removal
purpose
and
certainly
it
doesn’t
seem
to
me
excluded
on
the
complaint
that
that’s
what
ohio
would
do.
certainly,
it
ought
not
to
be
the
case
but
because
the
one
level
of
funds
is
so
hard
to
compute
in
so
amount
--
and
so
amends
in
amount
that
the
polluter
should
simply
go
away
scot-free.
and
finally,
i
would
point
out
in
this
regard
that
if
ohio
were
using
the
funds
in
this
particular
way
as
a
means
of
remedying
the
nuisance
it
couldn’t
be
claimed
as
the
defendants
do
that
there
were
some
risk
of
double
recovery
because
although
the
measure
might
be
the
same
as
could
be
obtained
in
the
suit
brought
by
an
individual.
the
use
and
the
remedy
would
be
entirely
different.
i
come
now
to
the
principal
area
of
controversy
of
importance
to
the
united
states
and
that
is
the
possible
liability
of
dow
chemical
of
canada
or
of
its
parent
dow
chemical
company
for
acts
done
at
the
company’s
canadian
factory
whose
effects
are
felt
in
the
united
states.
now
these
two
companies
appear
quite
strongly
to
insist
that
any
assertion
of
jurisdiction
by
this
court
might
provoke
in
international
incident
or
undercut
in
international
treaty
and
we
want
to
make
it
claim
that
it’s
the
view
of
the
united
states
that
no
such
consequences
would
occur.
the
power
of
american
courts
to
redress
torts
whose
effects
are
felt
on
american
soil
is
we
believe
indisputable.
the
company
has
also
raised
certain
doubts
regarding
whether
the
court
could
provide
an
effective
remedy.
this
goes
essentially
to
matters
of
discretion
but
we
do
point
out
certain
respects
in
which
more
facts
are
needed
before
a
final
conclusion
can
be
reach.
let
me
begin
with
the
issue
of
liability,
i
think
all
of
us
would
agree
on
a
simple
case
in
which
issues
of
causation
are
not
obscure
in
case
of
the
individual
who
is
standing
on
one
side
of
niagara
river
fires
a
rifle
across
it
and
it
kills
the
person
on
the
other
side.
the
person
--
if
the
state
in
which
the
individual
was
murdered
is
able
to
secure
jurisdiction
over
the
person
of
the
sniper.
and
that
of
course
is
not
a
question
that’s
here
today.
there
could
be
no
dispute
of
its
power
to
try
him
for
murder.
international
law
recognizes
that
right
and
i
don’t
think
the
party
seriously
contests
it.
the
situation
is
the
same
if
instead
of
sending
a
rifle
bullet
he
sends
sludge
which
causes
a
public
nuisance
on
the
other
side
of
the
river.
again,
to
the
extent
that
a
public
nuisance
may
be
prosecuted
as
a
crime
--
there
could
be
no
dispute
that
the
recipient
state
may
prosecute
the
individual
if
it
may
obtain
service
on
him
before
that
crime.
a
canadian
court
would
feel
as
competent
as
an
american
court
in
those
circumstances
and
the
only
way
an
international
incident
could
arise
would
be
if
some
improper
means
have
been
used
to
secure
jurisdiction
of
the
defendant
or
a
due
process
where
somehow
denied
in
the
course
of
the
trial
and
both
of
which
we
are
quite
certain
will
not
happen
in
this
proceedings.
there
might
be
some
question
whether
a
judicial
decree
obtained
in
civil
proceedings
would
be
enforceable
in
the
courts
of
the
other
jurisdiction.
and
that
is
--
we
don’t
--
we
think
it
should
be
quite
clear
to
this
court
that
if
it
ultimately
does
grant
relief
a
judgment
to
ohio
then
judgment
will
then
be
ohio
is
to
enforce
as
part
of
the
same
situation
and
ohio
may
indeed
have
some
difficulty
in
enforcing
that
judgment
in
canadian
court.
and
that's
a
matter
to
where
trouble
return
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
in
canada,
excuse
me.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
so
far
as
enforcement
to
the
judgment
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that’s
right.
the
suggestion
is
made
that
the
fact
that
this
is
a
public
nuisance
suit
here
makes
a
difference.
i
think
the
argument
is
essentially
that
only
the
united
states
could
bring
an
action
for
public
nuisance
against
a
person
who
is
resident
in
a
foreign
country
and
producing
his
nuisance
from
that
point.
as
if
only
the
united
states
could
prosecute
the
sniper
on
the
banks
of
the
niagara
river
or
a
murder
which
he
causes
in
new
york
state,
i
think
to
state
the
proposition
in
that
way
is
to
answer
under
the
constitution.
the
states
are
forbidden
from
engaging
in
diplomacy
but
ohio
doesn’t
seek
to
involve
the
canadian
government
in
any
respect
in
this
case.
it
charges
an
offense
to
its
domestic
laws
felt
on
its
own
soil
against
the
particular
individual
who
may
or
may
not
be
within
its
power
to
bring
to
justice
and
if
the
individual
is
within
its
power.
it
is
only
because
it
is
available
to
domestic
service
of
process.
canada
need
never
be
consulted
in
its
territory
is
never
entered
upon.
ohio
obtains
the
judgment
and
seeks
to
have
it
enforced
as
i
said
before
if
it
must
take
it
to
canada,
canadian
courts
will
then
decide
what
recognition
to
give
the
judgment.
that
will
be
a
canadian
domestic
matter.
there
are
of
course
alternative
ways
of
dealing
with
the
situation.
ohio
might
have
come
to
the
united
states
and
requested
the
united
states
to
take
this
matter
up
with
the
canadian
government
as
a
diplomatic
matter.
that
was
done
in
the
case
prominently
mentioned
in
the
briefs
the
trail
smelter
case
in
british
columbia.
but
this
is
merely
an
alternative
on
a
required
motive
proceeding
and
as
we
said
out
at
length
in
our
brief,
the
boundary
waters
treaty
of
1909
provides
no
mechanism
for
the
mandatory
resolution
of
pollution
disputes
concerning
boundary
waters.
in
this
connection,
i
think
i
ought
to
correct
a
misapprehension
which
dow
chemical
of
united
states
at
least
have
with
regard
to
the
boundary
waters
treaty.
they
twice
mentioned
article
ii
of
the
treaty
as
if
it
had
some
bearing
on
this
case
may
be
found
at
page
3-a
and
4-a
of
the
brief
of
dow
chemical
of
canada.
that
article
applies,
well
i
think
and
perhaps
the
quickest
way
to
do
this
is
to
suggest
the
three
different
sorts
of
--
three
different
situations
that
one
may
have
across
the
canadian-american
boundary.
and
we
have
a
river
that
runs
across
the
boundary
and
may
be
interfered
with
upstream
or
downstream
and
then
one
may
have
waters
like
lake
erie
which
sit
on
the
boundary.
only
waters
on
the
boundary
are
designated
boundary
waters
under
the
treaty.
article
ii
provides
as
to
a
river
which
runs
across
the
boundary
that
if
someone
on
the
upstream
ended
it
interferes
with
its
use
and
that
might
conceivably
include
pollution
although
it
has
never
been
so
adjudicated,
then
and
in
that
circumstance
only
a
downstream
individual
may
come
into
the
courts
of
the
upstream
nation
and
litigate
in
that
forum
the
issue
of
the
damages
which
is
done
to
him
and
is
entitled
to
have
that
litigation
resolve
in
his
favor
under
the
laws
of
that
nation
as
if
he
were
a
citizen
thereof.
now,
that
is
a
specific
remedy
and
if
that
were
applicable
in
this
case,
ohio
would
be
able
to
go
into
the
courts
of
canada
and
get
relief
against
dow
canada.
it’s
not
applicable
here
because
we’re
dealing
with
boundary
waters
not
a
river
which
crosses
the
boundary
and
the
result
is
that
ohio
hasn’t
much
less
certain
remedy,
i
would
say
than
it
would
have
if
article
ii
applied.
nonetheless,
the
failure
of
the
treaty
to
deal
with
that
situation
in
the
view
of
the
united
states
does
not
at
all
exclude
the
possibility
of
the
remedy
which
ohio
is
seeking
today.
the
remedy
which
ohio
is
seeking
is
recognized
an
international
law
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
treaty
which
excludes
it.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
principle
stated
by
this
court
in
new
jersey
versus
new
york
city
is
equally
applicable
here.
if
the
defendant
is
before
the
court
and
i'm
reading
from
page
482
of
volume
283
of
the
court’s
opinion
that
the
defendant
is
before
the
court
in
the
property
of
plaintiff
and
its
citizens
that
is
alleged
to
have
been
injured
by
such
dumping
is
within
the
court’s
territorial
jurisdiction
the
situs
of
the
act
creating
the
nuisance
whether
within
or
without
the
united
states
is
of
no
importance.
and
turn
very
briefly
to
the
problems
of
enforcement
at
which
chiefly
is
i
think
this
court
has
already
recognized
should
await
later
resolution.
the
first
observation
is
that
to
the
extent
money
damages
are
possible
there
is
really
no
issue
about
enforcement
nor
is
there
any
possible
disability
regarding
this
court’s
power
to
give
injunctive
relief
so
far
as
that
injunctive
relief
applies
on
this
side
of
the
boundary.
if
the
court
has
jurisdiction
over
dow
canada’s
person
it
may
enjoin
dow
canada
requiring
it
to
remove
the
mercury
from
the
american
half
of
the
st.
clair
river
or
of
the
detroit
river
or
of
lake
erie
and
there
should
be
no
question
to
this
court’s
power
to
do
that.
there
are
i
think
some
problems
involved
with
granting
injunctive
relief
which
would
necessarily
take
effect
in
canada
or
to
put
--
excuse
me,
to
put
it
in
other
way
which
would
require
that
aid
of
a
canadian
court.
i
think,
if
the
court
wherever
to
conclude
that
that
were
necessary
it
could
fairly
apprehend
that
the
aid
of
a
canadian
court
might
not
be
forthcoming.
but
as
we
understand
its
complaint,
ohio
asked
only
that
dow
be
enjoined
from
producing
the
objective
to
effects
on
the
american
side
of
the
boundary.
and
the
cases
are
legion
which
state
that
such
an
injunction
is
proper
for
an
american
court
to
enter
the
salton
sea
cases,
the
united
states
versus
--
excuse
steele
versus
bulova
watch
company,
vanity
fair
mills
versus
eaton.
all
of
these
cases
quite
clearly
comprehend
that
where
an
effect
is
felt
within
the
united
states,
the
united
states
court
having
jurisdiction
of
the
parties
has
the
authority
to
enter
an
injunction
requiring
that
that
effect
be
seized
and
as
we
understand
that
is
all
that
ohio
seeks
in
this
case.
the
point
is
that
it
begs
the
question
to
state
as
dow
does.
the
dow
chemical
of
canada’s
conduct
has
been
wholly
fund
and
that
therefore
this
court
lacks
jurisdiction
to
correct
it.
on
the
allegations
of
the
complaint,
it
must
be
assumed
that
the
tortious
conduct
is
extended
to
this
country
and
if
that’s
the
case
there
is
no
principle
of
international
law
that
bars
this
court
from
entertaining
ohio
seeking.
thank
you.
