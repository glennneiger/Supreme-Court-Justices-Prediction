chief

e.
burger
we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
number
41
original
jurisdiction,
the
state
of
ohio
against
wyandotte
chemicals.
mr.
brown,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
haven't
you
brought
an
action
in
the
common
pleas
courts
of
ohio
(voice
overlap)
not
including
the
canadian
corporation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
is
their
case
different
from
the
basic
case
here
laying
aside
the
jurisdiction
of
the
canadian
corporation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
couldn’t
have
sought
that
action
here
against
the
deitrick
company,
could
you
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
deitrick
is
an
ohio
corporation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
brown.
mr.
strauss.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
not
be
more
perhaps
like
the
abstention
doctrine
applied
or
state
courts
have
jurisdiction
and
precisely
the
same
range
of
remedy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
three-judge
court
cases
that
come
here
frequently,
we
sometimes
sustain
as
we
did
last
year
in
reetz
against
bozanich
when
there
was
a
challenge
to
the
alaska
statute.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
we
have
jurisdiction
as
justice
white
suggested
that
we
remanded
the
state
court
because
there
was
a
possible
remedy
there.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
you
would
say
of
course
it’s
up
to
ohio,
do
you?
i’m
not
quite
sure
i
follow
you.
are
you
suggesting
that
the
courts
have
no
responsibility
for
enforcement
of
their
own
judgment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh!
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that’s
in
terms
of
territorial
jurisdiction?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
strauss.
mr.
moelmann.
chief
justice
warren
e.

thank
you
mr.
moelmann.[lunch
recess]
mr.
outerbridge,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
that’s
another
way
of
saying
that
the
court
has
no
jurisdiction
can
enter
in
an
injunction,
is
that
your
point?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
outerbridge.
mr.
mcneal.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
mcneal.
mr.
brown,
you
have
about
four
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
this
in
the
record
counsel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
this
in
the
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
that
that's
a
report
which
we
can
judicially
notice
but
if
you
have
a
letter
from
someone
that
is
not
within
the
scope
of
judicial
notice.
i
would
question
its
appropriateness
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.

you
