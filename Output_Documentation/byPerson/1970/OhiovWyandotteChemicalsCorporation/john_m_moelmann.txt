mr.
john
m.
moelmann
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
on
behalf
of
the
defendant
wyandotte
chemicals
corporation,
we
have
raised
no
question
of
jurisdiction
in
this
court.
it
is
our
position
that
it
is
a
discretionary
matter
within
the
court
sound
discretion
and
therefore
we
have
urged
certain
prudential
considerations
to
suggest
to
the
court
how
its
discretion
should
be
exercise.
there
are
not
only
considerable
legal
precedents
but
there
are
practical
precedents.
the
questions
have
indicated
the
legal
precedents
are
not
as
well-established
as
mr.
brown
would
have
the
court
believe.
the
cases
of
which
he
speaks
i
believe
were
cases
that
either
fell
within
the
round
of
cases
of
exclusive
jurisdiction
or
they
were
cases
where
there
were
no
mechanics
setup
by
the
statutes
for
administrative
agencies
to
afford
relief
and
therefore
the
court
exercise
its
discretion
because
the
applicant
had
no
other
place
to
go
for
a
relief.
for
the
court
to
accept
this
motion
is
our
belief
that
it
would
not
only
contravene
national
and
state
policy
which
relates
to
these
complex
problems
of
pollution,
but
also
has
an
international
aspect
to
it
under
the
treaty.
i'll
confine
my
remarks
solely
to
the
national
and
state
problem
because
my
colleagues
representing
dow
have
very
ably
handled
the
international
problem
and
i'm
sure
they
won't
discuss
it
with
you.
the
complexities
of
ecology
are
involved
here
as
well
as
the
complexity
of
remedies.
the
statutes
of
this
united
states
as
well
as
the
various
states
have
set
up
a
very
complex
organization
for
handling
the
matters
of
pollution
through
administrative
agencies
and
this
is
so
important
because
the
matter
of
pollution
as
being
a
problem
within
this
country
is
relatively
new.
for
instance,
nobody
knew
that
mercury
in
water
created
any
problem
before
last
march
1970,
less
than
a
year
ago.
these
companies
said,
we’re
emptying
water
into
the
streams
and
the
lakes
felt
that
they
were
doing
something
that
was
not
injurious
to
anybody.
wyandotte
had
continued
the
same
operation
for
over
32
years
and
under
the
inspections
of
the
state
of
michigan
through
their
water
resources
commission
which
inspected
them
periodically,
never
raised
any
question
about
mercury.
there
was
no
known
problem
and
still
science
is
not
aware
that
there
is
even
a
problem
now
in
so
far
as
the
metallic
mercury
which
is
inorganic
being
put
into
water
creating
the
methyl
mercury
which
is
organic
and
which
is
ingested
by
fish.
nobody
has
been
able
to
prove
that
that
comes
from
the
inorganic
mercury.
as
you
all
know,
mercury
is
very
heavy,
it
goes
into
water
and
it
sinks
right
to
the
bottom.
dow
has
its
plant
up
at
sarnia.
the
wyandotte
plant
is
at
wyandotte
on
the
detroit
river.
neither
of
them
are
on
lake
erie.
lake
erie
is
receiving
mercury
from
multiple
sources,
mr.
brown
has
tend
to
minimize
it
but
it
is
coming
not
only
from
these
sources
if
it
can
be
proven
they're
coming
from
there
and
nobody
is
quite
sure
of
that.
but
there
are
other
companies
that
are
on
those
waters
or
on
the
streams
emptying
into
lake
erie.
there
is
much
mercury
in
the
air
coming
from
furnaces
burning
coal
and
being
a
heavy
substance,
it
immediately
settles
on
the
earth
or
on
the
top
of
the
water
and
the
surface
waters
carry
it
into
lake
erie
and
other
bodies
of
water.
there
is
mercury
coming
from
sewage
disposal
plants
of
all
the
metropolitan
areas
around
that
area.
there
is
mercury
coming
from
less
serious
things
for
instance
even
the
dentist
run
some
of
it
down
his
sink
when
he
is
working
on
your
teeth.
mr.
john
m.
moelmann
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
moelmann
on
the
detroit
river.
mr.
john
m.
moelmann
i
believe
there
is
one
in
one
of
the
briefs,
is
there
not
counsel?
yes.
mr.
john
m.
moelmann
yes,
it’s
in
that.
mr.
john
m.
moelmann
it’s
in
the
document
that
mr.
justice
stewart
had
in
his
hand
there.
page

figure

since
the
problem
of
mercury
has
come
to
the
attention
of
the
public
and
by
the
way
it
was
accidentally
discovered
by
a
swedish
student
who
had
known
that
the
problem
was
studied
in
sweden
in
so
far
as
that
it
had
to
do
with
wildlife
that
consumes
seed
treated
by
fungicides
and
in
the
fungicides,
mercury
is
used.
and
so
he
knew
that
that
problem
existed
and
when
he
found
by
accident
some
methyl
mercury
which
is
the
organic
type
within
the
fish
up
in
lake
st.
clair
and
reported
to
the
canadian
government,
they
immediately
reacted
and
before
they
could
determine
whether
or
not
it
was
any
serious
problem,
they
put
a
prohibition
on
fishing.
this
set
off
all
the
publicity
that
has
been
given
the
problem
but
the
manner
in
which
methyl
mercury
is
developed
is
unknown
to
science.
now,
counsel
spoke
of
the
japanese
incident.
before
commenting
on
that
i’d
like
to
say
that
no
one
in
north
america
or
europe
has
been
known
to
have
been
injured
by
ingesting
mercury
by
eating
fish.
the
only
incident
that's
known
is
the
incident
that
occurred
in
japan.
and
there,
the
situation
was
much
different
because
it
wasn’t
metallic
mercury
put
in
the
water.
it
was
organic
mercury
in
the
form
of
methyl
mercury
which
of
course
is
very
toxic.
it
was
in
just
--
it
was
induced
directly
into
the
water
and
a
place
where
this
village
got
all
of
its
shellfish
and
as
you
know
the
japanese
eat
fish
about
three
times
a
day.
and
therefore,
they
had
a
serious
problem,
but
that
problem
doesn’t
exist
in
this
country.
this
leads
me
to
the
conclusion
and
a
point
which
i
would
like
to
strongly
urge
to
this
court
in
deciding
whether
or
not
it
should
exercise
its
discretion
and
that
is
that
there
is
no
emergency
whatsoever
in
this
problem.
i
attended
the
science
conference
of
the
university
of
michigan
held
this
fall.
science
is
working
on
this
problem
everyday.
the
conclusions
i
learned
from
that
meeting
are
few
because
science
hasn’t
advance
very
far
in
the
subject.
but
i
did
learn
this,
that
there
is
no
eminent
danger
to
the
american
people
or
the
people
of
canada
and
any
location.
i
also
learned
that
there
are
many
bodies
of
water
on
this
continent
where
fish
are
found
to
contain
as
much
mercury
as
the
ones
in
lake
erie
and
there
is
no
commercial
dumping
of
mercury
at
all
into
those
bodies
of
water.
mr.
john
m.
moelmann
this
by
the
way
your
honor
does
not
kill
the
fish.
mr.
john
m.
moelmann
i
really
don’t
know.
mr.
john
m.
moelmann
there
are
a
lot
of
fish
there
mr.
justice
douglas
wrote
on
the
subject
maybe
he
could
tell
you
about.
i
don’t
know
how
many
fish
to
that.
mr.
john
m.
moelmann
i
understand
there
are
a
lot
of
fish
but
i
think
the
varieties
are
not
as
desirable
as
they
use
to.
mr.
john
m.
moelmann
that’s
right.
mr.
john
m.
moelmann
but
there
are
a
lot
of
problems
and
this
is
the
subject
and
which
mr.
justice
douglas
wrote
that
is
creating
this
problem
one
of
which
is
the
phosphates
that
are
continuously
dumped
in
the
lake
erie.
these
phosphates
have
cause
an
excessive
amount
of
algae
to
grow
in
that
lake
and
have
removed
the
oxygen
from
the
water
and
have
cause
the
type
of
fish
to
which
he
refer
to
greatly
developed.
mercury,
you
won't
even
be
aware
that
it
was
in
the
water
when
you
look
at
it.
mr.
john
m.
moelmann
they
had
it
closed
a
short
while
and
they
reopened
it.
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
they
still
prohibit
the
fishing
of
walleyes.
mr.
john
m.
moelmann
well,
apparently
they
seem
to
develop
a
greater
amount
of
methyl
mercury
in
their
tissue
than
the
other
fish.
mr.
john
m.
moelmann
for
walleye,
yes.
now,
wyandotte
seized
putting
any
mercury
into
detroit
river
on
march
24,
1970
as
soon
as
this
problem
became
apparent.
the
michigan
court
took
up
the
problem
and
a
consent
decree
was
entered
into
by
wyandotte
whereby
a
wyandotte
agreed
to
immediately
set
up
a
temporary
means
for
keeping
any
mercury
to
go
back
into
the
water
and
to
create
a
permanent
recycling
facility
by
may
1,
1971.
i
must
regretfully
advise
the
court
that
when
they
--
when
enter
the
problem
of
revising
the
whole
plant
to
do
this,
they
found
it
was
uneconomical
to
do
so
and
the
plant
will
be
permanently
closed
on
may
1st
--
pardon
april
1st
of
this
year.
there
is
of
course
the
alternate
remedies
which
have
been
mentioned.
we
have
this
network
or
federal
statutes
which
have
recently
been
developed
to
which
are
the
state
of
ohio
can
turn
for
its
relief.
i
don’t
have
time
to
go
into
them
but
the
briefs
cover
them
very
thoroughly
and
ohio
has
these
alternate
methods
which
are
much
more
able
to
deal
with
a
continuing
problem
and
to
work
out
solutions.
then
the
facilities
of
this
court,
if
this
court
were
to
take
this
case,
i
venture
to
say
it
won't
be
inundated
with
pollution
and
litigation.
the
facilities
of
this
court
are
not
set
up
for
that
purpose,
it
would
need
special
master.
it’s
a
kind
of
a
forum
non
conveniens
as
far
as
the
litigants
are
concerned
it
would
be
a
very
expensive
type
of
litigation
and
we
don’t
know
where
we’re
going
because
science
hasn’t
progress
that
far.
one
of
the
questions
had
to
do
with
the
prayer
of
the
complaint.
i’d
like
to
just
conclude
by
calling
your
specific
attention
to
the
prayers
of
this
complaint.
first,
that
as
the
court
to
declare
that
this
is
a
public
nuisance
and
that
it
be
abated.
it
has
already
been
abated.
secondly,
it
had
asked
for
an
injunction
of
something
which
is
already
seized
be
entered.
third,
it
has
set
a
mandatory
injunction
to
remove
all
mercury
compounds
from
lake
erie
be
entered
whereas
science
knows
of
no
way
this
can
be
done.
in
fact,
a
lot
of
the
scientists
are
saying
if
it
be
attempted
it
will
stir
up
the
mercury
so
it
will
cause
a
greater
problem.
and
this
decree
could
only
be
concerned
with
the
proportionate
share
of
the
mercury
in
the
water
that
the
respective
litigants
have
put
in
there
and
proportionate
to
what
everybody
has
contributed
to
the
situation.
and
that
has
become
a
fundamental
precedent
of
pollution
law.
how
will
that
be
determined?
you
know
they
can't
measure
the
mercury
in
the
lake
because
it
is
so
infinite
decimal
in
proportion
to
the
size
of
the
lake.
and
lastly,
they
asked
that
damages
be
assessed
to
compensate
for
existing
and
future
damages
to
lake
erie,
the
fish
and
other
wildlife,
the
vegetation
and
the
citizens
and
inhabitants
of
ohio
which
would
be
impossible
to
measure.
it
seems
to
me
their
prayer
indulges
in
asking
this
court
to
do
that
which
would
be
futile
to
take
top
tribunal
of
this
country
into
something
where
we
don’t
know
where
we’re
going.
mr.
john
m.

it

treated
by
fungicides
and
in
the
fungicides,
mercury
is
used.
and
so
he
knew
that
that
problem
existed
and
when
he
found
by
accident
some
methyl
mercury
which
is
the
organic
type
within
the
fish
up
in
lake
st.
clair
and
reported
to
the
canadian
government,
they
immediately
reacted
and
before
they
could
determine
whether
or
not
it
was
any
serious
problem,
they
put
a
prohibition
on
fishing.
this
set
off
all
the
publicity
that
has
been
given
the
problem
but
the
manner
in
which
methyl
mercury
is
developed
is
unknown
to
science.
now,
counsel
spoke
of
the
japanese
incident.
before
commenting
on
that
i’d
like
to
say
that
no
one
in
north
america
or
europe
has
been
known
to
have
been
injured
by
ingesting
mercury
by
eating
fish.
the
only
incident
that's
known
is
the
incident
that
occurred
in
japan.
and
there,
the
situation
was
much
different
because
it
wasn’t
metallic
mercury
put
in
the
water.
it
was
organic
mercury
in
the
form
of
methyl
mercury
which
of
course
is
very
toxic.
it
was
in
just
--
it
was
induced
directly
into
the
water
and
a
place
where
this
village
got
all
of
its
shellfish
and
as
you
know
the
japanese
eat
fish
about
three
times
a
day.
and
therefore,
they
had
a
serious
problem,
but
that
problem
doesn’t
exist
in
this
country.
this
leads
me
to
the
conclusion
and
a
point
which
i
would
like
to
strongly
urge
to
this
court
in
deciding
whether
or
not
it
should
exercise
its
discretion
and
that
is
that
there
is
no
emergency
whatsoever
in
this
problem.
i
attended
the
science
conference
of
the
university
of
michigan
held
this
fall.
science
is
working
on
this
problem
everyday.
the
conclusions
i
learned
from
that
meeting
are
few
because
science
hasn’t
advance
very
far
in
the
subject.
but
i
did
learn
this,
that
there
is
no
eminent
danger
to
the
american
people
or
the
people
of
canada
and
any
location.
i
also
learned
that
there
are
many
bodies
of
water
on
this
continent
where
fish
are
found
to
contain
as
much
mercury
as
the
ones
in
lake
erie
and
there
is
no
commercial
dumping
of
mercury
at
all
into
those
bodies
of
water.
mr.
john
m.
moelmann
this
by
the
way
your
honor
does
not
kill
the
fish.
mr.
john
m.
moelmann
i
really
don’t
know.
mr.
john
m.
moelmann
there
are
a
lot
of
fish
there
mr.
justice
douglas
wrote
on
the
subject
maybe
he
could
tell
you
about.
i
don’t
know
how
many
fish
to
that.
mr.
john
m.
moelmann
i
understand
there
are
a
lot
of
fish
but
i
think
the
varieties
are
not
as
desirable
as
they
use
to.
mr.
john
m.
moelmann
that’s
right.
mr.
john
m.
moelmann
but
there
are
a
lot
of
problems
and
this
is
the
subject
and
which
mr.
justice
douglas
wrote
that
is
creating
this
problem
one
of
which
is
the
phosphates
that
are
continuously
dumped
in
the
lake
erie.
these
phosphates
have
cause
an
excessive
amount
of
algae
to
grow
in
that
lake
and
have
removed
the
oxygen
from
the
water
and
have
cause
the
type
of
fish
to
which
he
refer
to
greatly
developed.
mercury,
you
won't
even
be
aware
that
it
was
in
the
water
when
you
look
at
it.
mr.
john
m.
moelmann
they
had
it
closed
a
short
while
and
they
reopened
it.
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
they
still
prohibit
the
fishing
of
walleyes.
mr.
john
m.
moelmann
well,
apparently
they
seem
to
develop
a
greater
amount
of
methyl
mercury
in
their
tissue
than
the
other
fish.
mr.
john
m.
moelmann
for
walleye,
yes.
now,
wyandotte
seized
putting
any
mercury
into
detroit
river
on
march
24,
1970
as
soon
as
this
problem
became
apparent.
the
michigan
court
took
up
the
problem
and
a
consent
decree
was
entered
into
by
wyandotte
whereby
a
wyandotte
agreed
to
immediately
set
up
a
temporary
means
for
keeping
any
mercury
to
go
back
into
the
water
and
to
create
a
permanent
recycling
facility
by
may
1,
1971.
i
must
regretfully
advise
the
court
that
when
they
--
when
enter
the
problem
of
revising
the
whole
plant
to
do
this,
they
found
it
was
uneconomical
to
do
so
and
the
plant
will
be
permanently
closed
on
may
1st
--
pardon
april
1st
of
this
year.
there
is
of
course
the
alternate
remedies
which
have
been
mentioned.
we
have
this
network
or
federal
statutes
which
have
recently
been
developed
to
which
are
the
state
of
ohio
can
turn
for
its
relief.
i
don’t
have
time
to
go
into
them
but
the
briefs
cover
them
very
thoroughly
and
ohio
has
these
alternate
methods
which
are
much
more
able
to
deal
with
a
continuing
problem
and
to
work
out
solutions.
then
the
facilities
of
this
court,
if
this
court
were
to
take
this
case,
i
venture
to
say
it
won't
be
inundated
with
pollution
and
litigation.
the
facilities
of
this
court
are
not
set
up
for
that
purpose,
it
would
need
special
master.
it’s
a
kind
of
a
forum
non
conveniens
as
far
as
the
litigants
are
concerned
it
would
be
a
very
expensive
type
of
litigation
and
we
don’t
know
where
we’re
going
because
science
hasn’t
progress
that
far.
one
of
the
questions
had
to
do
with
the
prayer
of
the
complaint.
i’d
like
to
just
conclude
by
calling
your
specific
attention
to
the
prayers
of
this
complaint.
first,
that
as
the
court
to
declare
that
this
is
a
public
nuisance
and
that
it
be
abated.
it
has
already
been
abated.
secondly,
it
had
asked
for
an
injunction
of
something
which
is
already
seized
be
entered.
third,
it
has
set
a
mandatory
injunction
to
remove
all
mercury
compounds
from
lake
erie
be
entered
whereas
science
knows
of
no
way
this
can
be
done.
in
fact,
a
lot
of
the
scientists
are
saying
if
it
be
attempted
it
will
stir
up
the
mercury
so
it
will
cause
a
greater
problem.
and
this
decree
could
only
be
concerned
with
the
proportionate
share
of
the
mercury
in
the
water
that
the
respective
litigants
have
put
in
there
and
proportionate
to
what
everybody
has
contributed
to
the
situation.
and
that
has
become
a
fundamental
precedent
of
pollution
law.
how
will
that
be
determined?
you
know
they
can't
measure
the
mercury
in
the
lake
because
it
is
so
infinite
decimal
in
proportion
to
the
size
of
the
lake.
and
lastly,
they
asked
that
damages
be
assessed
to
compensate
for
existing
and
future
damages
to
lake
erie,
the
fish
and
other
wildlife,
the
vegetation
and
the
citizens
and
inhabitants
of
ohio
which
would
be
impossible
to
measure.
it
seems
to
me
their
prayer
indulges
in
asking
this
court
to
do
that
which
would
be
futile
to
take
top
tribunal
of
this
country
into
something
where
we
don’t
know
where
we’re
going.
