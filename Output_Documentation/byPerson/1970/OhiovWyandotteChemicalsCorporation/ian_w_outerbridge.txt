mr.
ian
w.
outerbridge
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
since
of
march
of
1970,
our
horizons
of
knowledge
with
respect
to
the
problems
of
mercury
pollution
have
expanded
like
universe.
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
and
reply
the
court
will
find
an
article
from
the
washington
post
dated
december
28,
1970.
and
the
court
may
know
that
the
international
joint
commission
came
down
with
a
report
of
9
december
1970
and
that
report
was
filed
both
in
washington
and
ottawa
on
the
14th
of
january
1971.
i
would
like
to
review
with
the
court
some
of
the
facts
which
appear
from
these
two
most
recent
documents.
the
first
of
these
is
that
mercury
is
omnipresent,
it’s
present
everywhere.
it
occurs
naturally
and
the
conclusion
would
appear
to
be
that
only
50%
of
its
occurrence
is
as
a
consequence
of
the
effluent
of
manufacturing
processes.
the
second
one
is
that
up
to
1.5
parts
per
million
methyl
mercury
which
is
above
the
limit
of
0.5
set
by
the
department
of
health
has
been
found
in
fish
caught
as
much
as
42
years
ago
in
the
united
states
and
that
presence
of
mercury
in
those
fish
is
unlikely
to
attributable
to
pollution.
mr.
ian
w.
outerbridge
they
are
biological
specimen
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
ian
w.
outerbridge
preserved
in
alcohol.
mr.
ian
w.
outerbridge
they’ve
tested
them
and
found
mercury
present
in
the
flesh
of
those
fish
in
the
quantities
that
i
gave
the
court.
mr.
ian
w.
outerbridge
recent
test.
this
was
reported
in
the
washington
post
article
of
december
28.
thirdly,
the
ijc
reports
that
the
major
source
of
pollution
generally
of
lake
erie
is
the
detroit
river
and
the
second
largest
source
of
pollution
of
lake
erie
is
reported
by
the
international
joint
commission
as
being
the
state
of
ohio
itself.
thirdly,
the
international
joint
commission,
this
most
recent
report,
discusses
mercury
pollution
but
in
particular
it
touches
a
first
priority
to
phosphorus
pollution.
and
it
estimates
the
cause
that
something
in
the
order
of
$2
billion
and
urges
that
both
the
governments
of
canada
and
united
states
commence
immediately
to
clean
up
lake
erie
and
to
remove
the
phosphorus.
this
report
has
been
universally
well
received
in
canada
or
acting
prime
minister
mr.
sharp
has
committed
his
government
to
implementing
the
report.
mr.
william
p.
rogers,
your
government
has
indicated
and
this
quoted
as
saying
that
he
has
initiated
follow-up
action
in
a
most
urgent
way.
there
are
technological
limitations
to
the
association
of
mercury
pollution
short
of
shutting
the
plants
completely
and
abandoning
them
as
was
the
alternative
selected
by
wyandotte.
and
the
fact
of
this
exister
set
out
in
the
appendices
to
the
brief
in
reply.
but
by
way
of
comparison,
the
court
should
examine
the
record
file
with
respect
to
detrex
chemical
industries
incorporated
of
ashville,
ohio.
now,
this
is
a
company
engaged
in
the
same
business
as
my
client’s.
under
a
cease
and
desist
order
of
april
13,
1970
by
the
government
of
the
state
of
ohio,
in
the
material
before
the
court
indicates
that
on
may
11,
1970
and
that's
the
last
report
we
have,
after
the
operational
changes
in
that
plant
have
been
completed.
short
of
shutting
that
plant
down,
their
escape
was
1.2
pounds
per
day
which
escape,
i
tell
the
court,
is
greater
than
the
escape
continuing
from
my
client’s
plant
in
this
argument
which
is
less
than
a
pound
a
day.
and
if
the
court
would
look
at
the
draft
regulations
of
the
department
of
fisheries
and
forestry
of
the
government
of
canada
proposed
to
be
introduced
when
the
government
resumes
to
observe
that
the
government
of
canada
recognizes
a
technological
limitation
to
the
ability
of
mankind
to
shut
off
the
flow
of
mercury
from
this
type
of
an
operation,
short
of
shutting
down
the
plant.
appendix
5
filed
that
the
brief
in
reply
is
a
list
of
eight
companies
provided
by
your
government
upon
our
request
is
being
known
to
have
discharged
mercury
in
lake
erie
and
there
are
eight
that
have
listed
and
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
dow
and
my
clients
are
not
one
of
them
or
is
not.
two
of
these
are
companies
situate
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania,
one
of
them
is
a
company
situate
in
the
new
york
state,
one
of
them
is
a
company
situate
in
michigan
and
four
of
them
are
companies
resident
within
the
state
of
ohio.
one
cannot
refrain
from
reference
to
the
dictum
of
mr.
justice
holmes
in
missouri
and
illinois
1905
it’s
at
page
522
whereas
here
the
plaintiff
has
sovereign
powers
and
deliberately
permits
discharges
similar
to
those
of
which
he
complains.
it
not
only
offers
standard
to
which
the
defendant
has
the
right
to
appeal,
but
it
warrants
the
defendant
in
demanding
the
strict
disproof
that
the
plaintiff’s
own
conduct
does
not
produce
the
result.
i
would
like
to
comment
with
respect
to
mr.
--
mr.
ian
w.
outerbridge
how
that
applies?
mr.
ian
w.
outerbridge
it
is
my
submission
to
the
court
that
the
state
of
ohio
can
legislatively
and
can
administratively
and
can
judicially
take
action
against
the
polluters
with
its
all
jurisdiction
and
if
they
do,
then
the
standard
that
they
adopt
with
respect
to
their
own
polluters
becomes
the
standard
that
we
can
comply
with
and
i
would
say
to
the
court
that
we
comply
with
the
standard
which
is
much
higher
than
the
standard
which
the
state
of
ohio
expects
of
its
own
residents
and
citizens.
i
would
like
to
make
one
comment
with
respect
to
the
brief
of
the
solicitor
general.
reliance
is
placed
by
the
solicitor
general
on
a
case
of
u.s.
versus
aluminum
company
of
america
and
he
also
fairly
mentioned
the
two
cases
to
the
court
vanity
fair
mills
and
t.
eaton
company
and
steele
and
bulova
watch.
it’s
my
respectful
submission
that
when
these
cases
are
examined
carefully
the
only
two
cases
which
are
governing
the
problem
we’re
confronted
with
is
the
steele
and
bulova
watch
case
as
amplified
and
explained
in
vanity
fair
and
t.
eaton
company.
because
in
the
vanity
fair
case,
you’re
dealing
with
precisely
the
situation
we
have
here
of
a
non-resident,
citizen
of
a
foreign
country
carrying
on
conduct
in
that
foreign
country
subject
to
and
regulated
by
the
governments
of
that
foreign
country
and
the
conduct
is
conduct
which
is
approved
of
by
that
foreign
county.
now,
by
that
i'm
not
suggesting
to
the
court
that
my
government
approves
pollution.
i
am
saying
to
the
court
however,
that
my
government
--
the
government
which
regulates
the
company
that
i
represent
has
enacted
regulations
and
has
an
effective
organization
called
the
interior
water
resources
commission
which
regulates
examines,
tests
samples
and
has
approved
of
the
quality
of
the
effluent
escaping
from
the
plant
in
sarnia.
and
in
those
cases,
the
principle
would
appear
to
be
that
if
the
order
of
the
court
is
one
which
would
infringe
upon
the
sovereignty
of
foreign
sovereign,
then
injunctive
relief
are
not
to
be
granted
and
the
court
has
no
jurisdiction
to
entertain
injunctive
relief.
now,
i
do
not
quarrel
with
the
proposition
of
the
law
of
ohio,
may
apply
with
respect
to
an
action
for
damages
that
remarks
directed
solely
to
the
action
that
is
sought
to
be
maintained
for
an
injunction
and
for
mandatory
injunction.
there
is
a
second
principle
--
mr.
ian
w.
outerbridge
i
would
say
mr.
justice
black
that
the
action
would
be
one
which
should
take
place
between
two
sovereigns
and
short
of
making
war,
there's
no
way
in
which
the
courts
can
enforce
the
injunction.
mr.
ian
w.
outerbridge
i'm
simply
stating
as
a
matter
of
principle
that
if
the
resident
--
if
a
national
of
a
foreign
sovereign
and
as
resident
in
the
other
country
and
if
the
order
of
the
court
would
infringe
upon
by
that
be
i
submit
in
conflict
with
for
example
if
the
courts
of
ontario
were
to
say
that
as
a
matter
of
necessity
it
was
an
importance
to
them
that
the
industrial
complex
in
sarnia
be
maintained
because
of
the
labor
forces
that
would
be
employed
there.
and
they
said
that
it
could
go
on
and
must
go
on,
then
there
would
be
a
clear
conflict
and
that
is
something
which
should
be
resolved
diplomatically
and
not
by
judicial
action.
mr.
ian
w.
outerbridge
well,
nothing
is
a
rather
exclusive
word.
mr.
ian
w.
outerbridge
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
the
proper
course
would
be
to
resort
to
diplomatic
action
between
the
two
countries
long
before
anybody
be
--
is
killed.
mr.
ian
w.
outerbridge
i
believe
that
is
the
state
of
the
authorities.
mr.
ian
w.
outerbridge
yes,
and
i’d
like
to
come
to
that
further
mr.
chief
justice.
there
are
line
of
cases
that
say
that
this
court
ought
not
to
assume
original
jurisdiction
in
the
cases
where
indispensable
parties
cannot
be
brought
before
this
court.
and
to
adjudicate
on
the
issues
presented
is
my
respectful
submission
that
there
are
number
of
indispensable
parties
who
cannot
be
brought
before
the
court.
my
respectful
submission
that
the
residents
of
the
state
ohio
cannot
be
brought
before
this
court
constitutionally,
that
is
the
four
companies
who
have
known
to
be
polluters.
with
my
respectful
submission
that
the
problem
of
ontario
and
the
government
of
canada
are
also
indispensable
parties
because
anyone
who’s
going
to
tamper
with
the
ecology
of
lake
erie
must
have
authority
or
jurisdiction
to
bind
all
of
the
people
who
are
going
to
be
concerned.
and
because
these
people
are
indispensable
parties
on
the
authority
of
the
minnesota
and
northern
security
case
and
arizona
and
california
case,
this
court
ought
to
decline
jurisdiction
because
people
who
are
indispensable
to
the
orders
which
this
court
must
make
cannot
be
brought
before
the
court.
mr.
ian
w.
outerbridge
i'm
sorry
i
cannot
answer
your
honor’s
question.
i
would
say
this
to
you
mr.
justice
douglas
that
the
matter
is
--
in
my
respectful
submission
govern
by
the
international
joint
commission
and
the
proper
source
and
proper
course
should
be
to
resort
to
the
international
joint
commission.
it
is
my
respectful
submission
that
basic
to
this
case
is
only
one
real
issue
and
that
is
whether
or
not
the
legislative
jurisdictions
--
your
government
and
my
government,
the
governments
of
the
countries,
the
government
of
the
states,
the
provinces
whether
they
can
avoid
to
come
into
grips
with
their
real
responsibility
which
is
to
adjudicate
and
legislate
and
make
decisions
with
respect
to
pollution.
now,
they
have
responsibility
and
they’ve
got
ample
powers.
their
powers
are
as
greater
than
this
court
in
terms
of
the
executive
power.
they
have
administrative
capacities
well
beyond
the
administrative
capacity
of
this
court
and
they
are
the
ones
that
should
be
doing
the
job.
but
instead
in
this
action
we
are
in
a
situation
where
the
state
of
ohio
and
the
state
of
michigan
are,
if
i
may
respectfully
submit,
really
shirking
their
responsibilities
and
seeking
to
force
that
responsibility
under
the
court.
if
the
court
accepts
responsibility
and
if
the
court
assumes
jurisdiction,
the
effect,
in
my
respectful
submission,
is
to
consign
the
whole
problem
of
pollution
in
lake
erie
which
is
a
very
urgent
problem
with
the
international
joint
commission
urges
be
undertaken
immediately.
it’s
to
consign
that
whole
problem
to
the
judicial
process.
mr.
ian
w.
outerbridge
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
you're
right
with
this
submission
i
would
make
to
you.(
voice
overlap)
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
ian
w.
outerbridge
the
submission
i
made
to
you
is
that
the
process
--
it’s
totally
impossible
to
enjoin
one
polluter
if
you
don’t
enjoin
them
all.
mr.
ian
w.
outerbridge
they
must
all
be
before
the
court.
mr.
ian
w.
outerbridge
no,
with
respect
you
can
move
for
a
simple
injunction
with
respect
to
anyone
of
these
companies,
in
any
jurisdiction.
you
could
come
into
ontario
--
mr.
ian
w.
outerbridge
yes,
and
ontario,
you
could
enjoin
ontario
in
ontario,
you
could
enjoin
any
company
in
ohio
in
ohio,
you
could
enjoin
any
company
in
michigan
in
michigan.
the
problem
is
with
respect
to
the
remedial
situation
whose
going
to
dig
it
up
and
how
is
it
going
to
be
done.
mr.
ian
w.
outerbridge
indispensable
parties,
they
are
indispensable
to
the
remedial
--
mr.
ian
w.
outerbridge
not
to
the
prohibitory
injunction.
mr.
ian
w.
outerbridge
not
to
the
prohibitory
injunction
except
if
i
may
just
add
this
that
there
is
no
point
in
making
a
mandatory
order
if
you
can’t
stop.
mr.
ian
w.
outerbridge
thank
you,
mr.
justice.
mr.
ian
w.
outerbridge
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
since
of
march
of
1970,
our
horizons
of
knowledge
with
respect
to
the
problems
of
mercury
pollution
have
expanded
like
universe.
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
and
reply
the
court
will
find
an
article
from
the
washington
post
dated
december
28,
1970.
and
the
court
may
know
that
the
international
joint
commission
came
down
with
a
report
of
9
december
1970
and
that
report
was
filed
both
in
washington
and
ottawa
on
the
14th
of
january
1971.
i
would
like
to
review
with
the
court
some
of
the
facts
which
appear
from
these
two
most
recent
documents.
the
first
of
these
is
that
mercury
is
omnipresent,
it’s
present
everywhere.
it
occurs
naturally
and
the
conclusion
would
appear
to
be
that
only
50%
of
its
occurrence
is
as
a
consequence
of
the
effluent
of
manufacturing
processes.
the
second
one
is
that
up
to
1.5
parts
per
million
methyl
mercury
which
is
above
the
limit
of
0.5
set
by
the
department
of
health
has
been
found
in
fish
caught
as
much
as
42
years
ago
in
the
united
states
and
that
presence
of
mercury
in
those
fish
is
unlikely
to
attributable
to
pollution.
mr.
ian
w.
outerbridge
they
are
biological
specimen

justice
white.

mr.
ian
w.
outerbridge
they’ve
tested
them
and
found
mercury
present
in
the
flesh
of
those
fish
in
the
quantities
that
i
gave
the
court.
mr.
ian
w.
outerbridge
recent
test.
this
was
reported
in
the
washington
post
article
of
december
28.
thirdly,
the
ijc
reports
that
the
major
source
of
pollution
generally
of
lake
erie
is
the
detroit
river
and
the
second
largest
source
of
pollution
of
lake
erie
is
reported
by
the
international
joint
commission
as
being
the
state
of
ohio
itself.
thirdly,
the
international
joint
commission,
this
most
recent
report,
discusses
mercury
pollution
but
in
particular
it
touches
a
first
priority
to
phosphorus
pollution.
and
it
estimates
the
cause
that
something
in
the
order
of
$2
billion
and
urges
that
both
the
governments
of
canada
and
united
states
commence
immediately
to
clean
up
lake
erie
and
to
remove
the
phosphorus.
this
report
has
been
universally
well
received
in
canada
or
acting
prime
minister
mr.
sharp
has
committed
his
government
to
implementing
the
report.
mr.
william
p.
rogers,
your
government
has
indicated
and
this
quoted
as
saying
that
he
has
initiated
follow-up
action
in
a
most
urgent
way.
there
are
technological

reply.
but
by
way
of
comparison,
the
court
should
examine
the
record
file
with
respect
to
detrex
chemical
industries
incorporated
of
ashville,
ohio.
now,
this
is
a
company
engaged
in
the
same
business
as
my
client’s.
under
a
cease
and
desist
order
of
april
13,
1970
by
the
government
of
the
state
of
ohio,
in
the
material
before
the
court
indicates
that
on
may
11,
1970
and
that's
the
last
report
we
have,
after
the
operational
changes
in
that
plant
have
been
completed.
short
of
shutting
that
plant
down,
their
escape
was
1.2
pounds
per
day
which
escape,
i
tell
the
court,
is
greater
than
the
escape
continuing
from
my
client’s
plant
in
this
argument
which
is
less
than
a
pound
a
day.
and
if
the
court
would
look
at
the
draft
regulations
of
the
department
of
fisheries
and
forestry
of
the
government
of
canada
proposed
to
be
introduced
when
the
government
resumes
to
observe
that
the
government
of
canada
recognizes
a
technological
limitation
to
the
ability
of
mankind
to
shut
off
the
flow
of
mercury
from
this
type
of
an
operation,
short
of
shutting
down
the
plant.
appendix
5
filed
that
the
brief
in
reply
is
a
list
of
eight
companies
provided
by
your
government
upon
our
request
is
being
known
to
have
discharged
mercury
in
lake
erie
and
there
are
eight
that
have
listed
and
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
dow
and
my
clients
are
not
one
of
them
or
is
not.
two
of
these
are
companies
situate
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania,
one
of
them
is
a
company
situate
in
the
new
york
state,
one
of
them
is
a
company
situate
in
michigan
and
four
of
them
are
companies
resident
within
the
state
of
ohio.
one
cannot
refrain
from
reference
to
the
dictum
of
mr.
justice
holmes
in
missouri
and
illinois
1905
it’s
at
page
522
whereas
here
the
plaintiff
has
sovereign
powers
and
deliberately
permits
discharges
similar
to
those
of
which
he
complains.
it
not
only
offers
standard
to
which
the
defendant
has
the
right
to
appeal,
but
it
warrants
the
defendant
in
demanding
the
strict
disproof
that
the
plaintiff’s
own
conduct
does
not
produce
the
result.
i
would
like
to
comment
with
respect
to
mr.
--
mr.
ian
w.
outerbridge
how
that
applies?
mr.
ian
w.
outerbridge
it
is
my
submission
to
the
court
that
the
state
of
ohio
can
legislatively
and
can
administratively
and
can
judicially
take
action
against
the
polluters
with
its
all
jurisdiction
and
if
they
do,
then
the
standard
that
they
adopt
with
respect
to
their
own
polluters
becomes
the
standard
that
we
can
comply
with
and
i
would
say
to
the
court
that
we
comply
with
the
standard
which
is
much
higher
than
the
standard
which
the
state
of
ohio
expects
of
its
own
residents
and
citizens.
i
would
like
to
make
one
comment
with
respect
to
the
brief
of
the
solicitor
general.
reliance
is
placed
by
the
solicitor
general
on
a
case
of
u.s.
versus
aluminum
company
of
america
and
he
also
fairly
mentioned
the
two
cases
to
the
court
vanity
fair
mills
and
t.
eaton
company
and
steele
and
bulova
watch.
it’s
my
respectful
submission
that
when
these
cases
are
examined
carefully
the
only
two
cases
which
are
governing
the
problem
we’re
confronted
with
is
the
steele
and
bulova
watch
case
as
amplified
and
explained
in
vanity
fair
and
t.
eaton
company.
because
in
the
vanity
fair
case,
you’re
dealing
with
precisely
the
situation
we
have
here
of
a
non-resident,
citizen
of
a
foreign
country
carrying
on
conduct
in
that
foreign
country
subject
to
and
regulated
by
the
governments
of
that
foreign
country
and
the
conduct
is
conduct
which
is
approved
of
by
that
foreign
county.
now,
by
that
i'm
not
suggesting
to
the
court
that
my
government
approves
pollution.
i
am
saying
to
the
court
however,
that
my
government
--
the
government
which
regulates
the
company
that
i
represent
has
enacted
regulations
and
has
an
effective
organization
called
the
interior
water
resources
commission
which
regulates
examines,
tests
samples
and
has
approved
of
the
quality
of
the
effluent
escaping
from
the
plant
in
sarnia.
and
in
those
cases,
the
principle
would
appear
to
be
that
if
the
order
of
the
court
is
one
which
would
infringe
upon
the
sovereignty
of
foreign
sovereign,
then
injunctive
relief
are
not
to
be
granted
and
the
court
has
no
jurisdiction
to
entertain
injunctive
relief.
now,
i
do
not
quarrel
with
the
proposition
of
the
law
of
ohio,
may
apply
with
respect
to
an
action
for
damages
that
remarks
directed
solely
to
the
action
that
is
sought
to
be
maintained
for
an
injunction
and
for
mandatory
injunction.
there
is
a
second
principle
--
mr.
ian
w.
outerbridge
i
would
say
mr.
justice
black
that
the
action
would
be
one
which
should
take
place
between
two
sovereigns
and
short
of
making
war,
there's
no
way
in
which
the
courts
can
enforce
the
injunction.
mr.
ian
w.
outerbridge
i'm
simply
stating
as
a
matter
of
principle
that
if
the
resident
--
if
a
national
of
a
foreign
sovereign
and
as
resident
in
the
other
country
and
if
the
order
of
the
court
would
infringe
upon
by
that
be
i
submit
in
conflict
with
for
example
if
the
courts
of
ontario
were
to
say
that
as
a
matter
of
necessity
it
was
an
importance
to
them
that
the
industrial
complex
in
sarnia
be
maintained
because
of
the
labor
forces
that
would
be
employed
there.
and
they
said
that
it
could
go
on
and
must
go
on,
then
there
would
be
a
clear
conflict
and
that
is
something
which
should
be
resolved
diplomatically
and
not
by
judicial
action.
mr.
ian
w.
outerbridge
well,
nothing
is
a
rather
exclusive
word.
mr.
ian
w.
outerbridge
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
the
proper
course
would
be
to
resort
to
diplomatic
action
between
the
two
countries
long
before
anybody
be
--
is
killed.
mr.
ian
w.
outerbridge
i
believe
that
is
the
state
of
the
authorities.
mr.
ian
w.
outerbridge
yes,
and
i’d
like
to
come
to
that
further
mr.
chief
justice.
there
are
line
of
cases
that
say
that
this
court
ought
not
to
assume
original
jurisdiction
in
the
cases
where
indispensable
parties
cannot
be
brought
before
this
court.
and
to
adjudicate
on
the
issues
presented
is
my
respectful
submission
that
there
are
number
of
indispensable
parties
who
cannot
be
brought
before
the
court.
my
respectful
submission
that
the
residents
of
the
state
ohio
cannot
be
brought
before
this
court
constitutionally,
that
is
the
four
companies
who
have
known
to
be
polluters.
with
my
respectful
submission
that
the
problem
of
ontario
and
the
government
of
canada
are
also
indispensable
parties
because
anyone
who’s
going
to
tamper
with
the
ecology
of
lake
erie
must
have
authority
or
jurisdiction
to
bind
all
of
the
people
who
are
going
to
be
concerned.
and
because
these
people
are
indispensable
parties
on
the
authority
of
the
minnesota
and
northern
security
case
and
arizona
and
california
case,
this
court
ought
to
decline
jurisdiction
because
people
who
are
indispensable
to
the
orders
which
this
court
must
make
cannot
be
brought
before
the
court.
mr.
ian
w.
outerbridge
i'm
sorry
i
cannot
answer
your
honor’s
question.
i
would
say
this
to
you
mr.
justice
douglas
that
the
matter
is
--
in
my
respectful
submission
govern
by
the
international
joint
commission
and
the
proper
source
and
proper
course
should
be
to
resort
to
the
international
joint
commission.
it
is
my
respectful
submission
that
basic
to
this
case
is
only
one
real
issue
and
that
is
whether
or
not
the
legislative
jurisdictions
--
your
government
and
my
government,
the
governments
of
the
countries,
the
government
of
the
states,
the
provinces
whether
they
can
avoid
to
come
into
grips
with
their
real
responsibility
which
is
to
adjudicate
and
legislate
and
make
decisions
with
respect
to
pollution.
now,
they
have
responsibility
and
they’ve
got
ample
powers.
their
powers
are
as
greater
than
this
court
in
terms
of
the
executive
power.
they
have
administrative
capacities
well
beyond
the
administrative
capacity
of
this
court
and
they
are
the
ones
that
should
be
doing
the
job.
but
instead
in
this
action
we
are
in
a
situation
where
the
state
of
ohio
and
the
state
of
michigan
are,
if
i
may
respectfully
submit,
really
shirking
their
responsibilities
and
seeking
to
force
that
responsibility
under
the
court.
if
the
court
accepts
responsibility
and
if
the
court
assumes
jurisdiction,
the
effect,
in
my
respectful
submission,
is
to
consign
the
whole
problem
of
pollution
in
lake
erie
which
is
a
very
urgent
problem
with
the
international
joint
commission
urges
be
undertaken
immediately.
it’s
to
consign
that
whole
problem
to
the
judicial
process.
mr.
ian
w.
outerbridge
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
you're
right
with
this
submission
i
would
make
to
you.(
voice
overlap)
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
ian
w.
outerbridge
the
submission
i
made
to
you
is
that
the
process
--
it’s
totally
impossible
to
enjoin
one
polluter
if
you
don’t
enjoin
them
all.
mr.
ian
w.
outerbridge
they
must
all
be
before
the
court.
mr.
ian
w.
outerbridge
no,
with
respect
you
can
move
for
a
simple
injunction
with
respect
to
anyone
of
these
companies,
in
any
jurisdiction.
you
could
come
into
ontario
--
mr.
ian
w.
outerbridge
yes,
and
ontario,
you
could
enjoin
ontario
in
ontario,
you
could
enjoin
any
company
in
ohio
in
ohio,
you
could
enjoin
any
company
in
michigan
in
michigan.
the
problem
is
with
respect
to
the
remedial
situation
whose
going
to
dig
it
up
and
how
is
it
going
to
be
done.
mr.
ian
w.
outerbridge
indispensable
parties,
they
are
indispensable
to
the
remedial
--
mr.
ian
w.
outerbridge
not
to
the
prohibitory
injunction.
mr.
ian
w.
outerbridge
not
to
the
prohibitory
injunction
except
if
i
may
just
add
this
that
there
is
no
point
in
making
a
mandatory
order
if
you
can’t
stop.
mr.
ian
w.
outerbridge
thank
you,
mr.
justice.
