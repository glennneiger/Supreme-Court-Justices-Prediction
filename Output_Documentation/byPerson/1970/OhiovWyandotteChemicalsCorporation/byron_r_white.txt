justice
byron
r.
white
what
law
do
you
think
the
court
applied
in
the
tennessee
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
common
federal
law
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
was
some
discussion
of
that
matter
would
be
about
--
what
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
what’s
the
applicable
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
are
claiming
under
a
federal
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
aren’t
stating
a
federal
cause
of
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
complaint
say
that
the
defendants
have
violated
the
federal
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you're
strictly
seeking
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
a
federal
forum
to
have
adjudicated
a
cause
of
action
under
ohio
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
we’re
obligated
to
apply
ohio
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
that’s
the
exact
the
same
or
say
that
the
party
--
do
you
think
it’s
not
exclusive?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
your
state
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
your
state
court,
you
could
have
sued
the
facilities
hence,
in
your
own
state
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
might
be
more
than
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
congress
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
are
you
suggesting
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
choice
is
yours
not
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
--
what’s
you
reaction,
it
may
not
go
to
jurisdiction
but
in
terms
on
the
injunction
phase
of
the
case,
what’s
the
significance
of
the
fact
that
if
it
is
a
fact
that
wyandotte
has
seized
to
pollute
and
that
dow
canada
is
under
an
ontario
order
to
hold
its
pollution
down
to
a
certain
level?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
let’s
assume
it
were
true
that
they
have
stopped
polluting
completely?
let's’
just
assume
what
we
are
talking
about.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
that
shouldn’t
go
to
jurisdiction
and
it
should
be
a
matter
for
the
special
master
on
motion?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
on
motion
to
dismiss
or
something
like
that
for
failure
to
state
a
claim
or
something
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
there
are
other
sources
of
mercury
besides
this
particular
defendant?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
are
other
contributors
to
mercury
(voice
overlap).
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
couldn’t
the
common
please
court
and
the
appropriate
county
in
ohio
handle
that
situation
just
as
well
if
not
a
little
better
than
we
can?
for
one
thing,
they’re
far
more
conversant
with
ohio
common
law
than
with
this
court
be
and
secondly,
i
don’t
see
why
matters
might
or
would
not
move
just
as
expeditiously
in
that
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
common
pleas
courts
of
ohio
are
used
to
immense
problems,
aren’t
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
problem
of
personal
service.
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
see
any
doubt
about
our
discretion
to
parties
being
it
was
the
last
resort
to
anything
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
strauss,
just
for
a
moment,
where
do
we
get
our
discretion
to
refuse
to
hear
a
case
that
is
within
our
original
jurisdiction,
what
is
the
theoretical
basis
for
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
sort
of
an
abstention
doctrine?
justice
byron
r.
white
sort
of
like
an
adversity
action
when
it’s
proper
to
abstain
staying
even
though
there’s
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
ohio
state
hearing,
they
closed
this
for
awhile.
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
they
(inaudible)
prohibit
the
fishing
of
walleyes?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
matter
of
curiosity,
mr.
outerbridge,
how
did
they
--
justice
byron
r.
white
biological
specimen?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
now
tested
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
those
are
recent
test
of
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
outerbridge,
i
take
it
under
your
submission
if
ohio
proceeded
against
one
of
its
own
companies
to
keep
it
from
polluting
lake
erie
that
there
would
be
some
indispensable
parties
in
that
action
namely
the
government
of
canada
and
ontario
wouldn’t
be
the
same
--
wouldn’t
you
have
the
same
problem
there,
anyone
who
tampers
at
lake
eire
is
immediately
concerning
a
foreign
government?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
question
is
whether
you're
right?[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
in
ohio
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
ohio
would
be
completely
without
power
to
move
against
one
of
the
companies
in
ohio
which
is
polluting
like
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
including
your
company?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
the
injunction
side
of
this
case,
your
argument
does
not
go
to
the
injunction
side
of
the
case
in
terms
of
indispensable
party?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
to
the
injunction?
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
rather
significant
course.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
mcneal,
with
what
result?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you're
suggesting
that
ohio
just
go
to
the

--

is

the

will
be

really
