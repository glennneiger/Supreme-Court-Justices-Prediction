this

found
guilty,
period?
justice

where
do
you
get
to
compromise
this?
justice
thurgood

they
only
have
two
hours
and
20
minutes.
that
was
awful
fast
bargaining.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
true
in
the
studies
made
in
juries
that
bargaining
comes
out
in
many
hours.
now
what
does
the
study
shows?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
just
--
i
can
see
where
a
jury
would
say
“well,
we
can
find
manslaughter,
voluntary
manslaughter,
third-degree
murder,
second-degree
murder,
first-degree
murder,
or
first-degree
murder
with
a
death
penalty.”
but
were
the
jury
had
the
decision
that
decides
whether
or
not
you
are
guilty
of
rape,
i
don't
see
so
much
bargaining
room
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
understand
the
basic
point
agree
that
that
second
part
of
the
charge
could
be
interpreted
as
telling
the
jury
that
you
must
be
unanimous
in
order
to
give
the
death
penalty
and
that
if
you
are
not
unanimous
on
the
death
penalty,
automatically
you
find
him
guilty.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
both
agree
these
are
evidence
are
rather
in
corporate
language
though.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
would
assume
that
there
were
guards
there
where
she
came
to
work.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
looked
for
it.
there
is
nothing
in
there
about
it,
does
it?
i
tried
to
find
it
in
the
record.
there
is
nothing
either
way.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it
