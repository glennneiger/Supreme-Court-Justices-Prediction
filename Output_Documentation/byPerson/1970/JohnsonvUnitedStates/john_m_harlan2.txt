justice
john
m.
harlan
does
the
record
show
how
long
the
jury
was
out?
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
come
in
for
instructions,
sacramental
instructions
during
that
period?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
suppose
the
part
of
your
argument
is,
i
understand
that
in
a
case
that
divided
the
court
of
appeals
as
closer
as
this
one
did.
it
was
whether
the
evidence
would
even
be
sufficient
to
the
question
of
harmless
error.
it
takes
out
the
significance
of
different
fact
in
which
would
they
done
where
the
evidence
is
drawn
upon.
justice
john
m.
harlan
may
i
ask
you
this
question,
what
sentence
did
this
man
get
in
the
crime?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
much
did
he
serve?
justice
john
m.
harlan
perhaps,
you're
talking
about
realism
too.
it
is
trued
that
the
government
in
fact
said
that
beginning
of
the
trial
they
were
not
asking
the
death
penalty.
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
i
would
suppose
that's
in
fact,
weighing
the
whole
situation
here
that
people's
talk.
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
the
record
show
this
man
was?
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
the
record
show,
how
old
this
defendant
was
at
the
time?
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
that
show
the
composition
of
the
jury?
was
it
all
male
jury
or
partly
male,
partly
female
or
what?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
do
you
argue
in
this
case
on
the
premise
of
jackson
governs
this
case
even
though
redirecting
this.
are
you
arguing
in
that
premise?
justice
john
m.
harlan
based
on
that
premise.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
the
second
i
want
to
ask
you.
so
here
on
that
premise,
your
argument
that
this
is
a
harmless
error
defense?
justice
john
m.
harlan
now
i
read
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
and
i
couldn't
find
any
advertent
discretion
on
the
harmless
error
issue
except
on
(inaudible)
at
the
other
attentions
here
without
merit,
am
i
right
mr.
huntington?
justice
john
m.
harlan
who
alerted
the
police
to
arrest?
justice
john
m.
harlan
she
did
not
make
any
complaint
to
the
police
herself?
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh!
i
understand
that
but
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
record
was
triggered
by
the
--
her
conversation
with
the
supervisor.
justice
john
m.
harlan
who
then
in
turn
got
in
touch
with
the
guards
and
then
called
the
police,
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
did
the
court
divide
that
in
the
evidence
point?
justice
john
m.
harlan
5
to
4.
justice
john
m.

four,
thought
the
evidence
