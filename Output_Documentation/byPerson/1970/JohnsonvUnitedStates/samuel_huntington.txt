mr.
samuel
huntington
mr.
justice
black
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government's
basic
position
in
this
case
is
that
no
prejudice
resulted
to
petitioner
from
the
trial
of
his
case
as
a
capital
case.
mr.
samuel
huntington
we
do
make
that
argument
at
some
length
in
our
brief
and
i
had
planned
to
refer
to
it
briefly.
i
think
it
is
set
forth
quite
adequately
in
our
brief.
the
main
thrust
of
petitioner's
argument
here
is
that
the
instructions
to
the
jury
on
the
death
penalty
issue
may
have
interfered
with
the
jury's
deliberations
on
the
issue
of
guilt.
and
heavy
reliance
is
placed
on
this
court's
decision
last
term
in
price
v.
georgia
in
the
1966
second
circuit's
opinion
in
the
hetenyi
v.
wilkins.
those
cases
of
course
involve
the
double
jeopardy
problem
of
retrying
a
person
for
murder
after
he
had
been
found
guilty
only
if
the
lesser
included
defense
and
that
conviction
had
been
upset
on
appeal.
the
analogy
petitioner
seeks
to
draw
between
the
price
and
wilkins
situations
in
this
case
are
unsound
for
several
different
reasons.
first
reason
is
that
--
in
each
of
the
former
cases,
the
murder
charge
was
one
of
the
principle
issues,
perhaps
the
principle
issue
in
the
case.
each
prosecutor
had
sought
to
establish
first-degree
murder
and
the
jury's
deliberations
on
the
defendant's
guilt
in
those
cases
would
necessarily
center
in
and
focus
on
that
first-degree
murder
charge.
by
contrast,
the
death
penalty
issue
in
this
case
played
a
very
insignificant
role.
some
statistics
are
worthy
of
note.
since
1930,
only
three
persons
have
been
executed
for
rape
in
the
district
of
columbia,
the
last
one
occurring
in
1949.
as
far
as
i
could
discover,
no
jury
has
imposed
a
death
penalty
in
a
rape
case
since
the
1950's
and
at
least
in
the
last
several
years,
the
government
has
not
sought
to
impose
the
death
penalty.
turning
to
this
case,
the
prosecutor
specifically
stated
during
voir
dire
that
he
was
not
seeking
the
death
penalty.
after
the
voir
dire,
neither
the
prosecutor
nor
petitioner's
trial
counsel
again
referred
to
the
death
penalty
issues.
in
a
summation,
the
prosecutor
merely
requested
a
verdict
of
guilty
as
charged.
and
then
of
course
during
the
charge
to
the
jury,
the
judge
twice
repeated
that
the
government
was
not
seeking
the
death
penalty.
nor
that
the
evidence
presented
by
the
government
make
it
likely
that
the
jury
would
seriously
consider
imposing
the
death
penalty.
this
was
not
a
case
of
aggravated
rape.
petitioner's
argument
on
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
really
cuts
two
ways
here.
he
argues
that
the
evidence
did
not
really
establish
none
consent
but
we
maintain
that
the
closer
the
evidences
on
the
consent
issue,
the
less
likely
it
is
that
the
government
would
--
that
the
jury
would
seriously
consider
imposing
the
death
penalty.
mr.
samuel
huntington
this
part
of
my
argument
is
based
on
that
premise.
we
do
argue
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
yes.
mr.
samuel
huntington
yes.
mr.
samuel
huntington
that's
right.
they
did
not
specifically
refer
the
harmless
error
test.
but
this
whole
argument
i'm
making
now,
i
think
supports
the
finding
that
a
petitioner
was
not
prejudiced
but
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
we're
now
turning
to
this
compromise
contention.
we
believe
that
that
is
also
the
analogy
with
price
and
wilkins
doesn't
exist.
in
price
and
wilkins,
there
was
the
choice
of
first-degree
murder,
second-degree
murder,
or
voluntary
manslaughter
and
not
guilty.
before
the
jury
could
unanimously
return
a
verdict
of
guilty
of
the
second
of
the
lesser
included
defense
which
they
did
in
both
price
and
wilkins,
the
juries
holding
out
for
not
guilty
had
to
give
up
their
insistence
on
that
verdict
and
the
guilty
is
whole
--
the
jury
is
holding
out
for
first-degree
murder
had
to
give
up
their
existence
on
that
verdict.
so
obviously
there
was
a
possibility
of
compromise.
as
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out
that
that
does
not
exist
here.
the
jurors
did
not
have
to
agree
on
the
death
penalty
issue
so
that
in
order
to
return
a
verdict
of
guilty,
if
it's
not
necessary
that
the
jurors
might
have
thought
that
they
should
impose
a
death
penalty,
give
up
anything.
obviously,
if
they
were
in
favor
of
imposing
the
death
penalty,
they
would
believe
in
petitioner's
guilt.
so
the
same
dynamics
that
existed
in
the
same
potential
for
compromise
just
don't
exist
here.
turning
now
to
the
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
he
does
make
that
point
here.
he
made
it
in
his
opening
brief
and
in
his
reply
brief.
he
quotes
the
first
full
paragraph
at
the
top
of
page
298
of
the
appendix
which
does
say
that
if
you
do
not
wish
to
have
the
death
penalty
imposed
or
if
you're
unable
to
agree,
then
you
should
merely
return
a
verdict
of
guilty.
however
if
you
go
back
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
i
think
--
i
read
in
isolation,
you
can
with
that
interpretation
on
it.
i
think
if
you
read
the
last
two
paragraphs
in
the
bottom
of
page
297
in
conjunction
with
that,
it's
perfectly
clear
that
the
trial
judge
instructed
the
jury
to
first
of
all
determine
the
guilt
question.
if
he
so
said
that
if
you
find
him
not
guilty,
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
if
you
find
him
guilty,
then
you
can
go
on
and
consider
the
death
penalty
issue
which
the
government
has
not
sought
to
impose
and
if
you're
unable
to
agree
there,
then
you
return
the
guilty
verdict.
i
don't
really
think
that
this
charge
is
ambiguous
on
that
point
at
all.
petitioner
also
alleges
in
his
brief,
he
didn't
refer
to
it
in
argument.
mr.
lippman
didn't
refer
to
it
that
the
fact
that
the
jury
was
death
qualified
may
have
prejudiced
petitioner
on
the
issue
of
guilt.
well,
to
begin
with
the
jury
in
this
case
was
not
truly
death
qualified
and
that
the
prosecutor
did
not
seek
to
obtain
a
jury
which
would
return
the
death
penalty.
the
prosecutor
merely
sought
to
--
merely
sought
to
have
a
jury
which
would
be
unbiased
on
the
issue
of
guilt.
in
his
sole
question
to
the
jurors
was
whether
their
views
on
capital
punishment
would
interfere
with
their
ability
to
return
a
verdict
of
guilty
if
the
evidence
so
compelled.
one
witness
was
excused.
now
several
decisions
of
this
court
have
established
that
the
exclusion
of
persons
for
views
of
--
on
capital
punishment
cannot
be
held
to
--
that
the
evidence
simply
is
insufficient
to
hold
that
that
would
bias,
make
the
jury
prosecution
prone.
the
witherspoon
case
so
held
in
bumper
and
north
carolina,
the
same
result
was
reached.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
pope
v.
united
states
involving,
decided
under
jackson
involving
the
jackson-type
decision.
the
jury
was
death
qualified.
he
--
pope
received
the
death
penalty
but
in
remanding
this
case,
this
case
simply
remanded
for
re-sentencing,
therefore,
impliedly
holding
that
pope
was
not
prejudiced
on
the
question
of
guilt,
although
that
point
was
argued.
i
would
like
briefly
to
refer
to
the
remaining
points
made
in
petitioner's
brief.
he
argues
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
that
that
issue
actually
involves
both
questions
of
fact
and
law.
the
legal
question
involves
a
proper
interpretation
of
the
phrase
forcibly
and
against
her
will
as
contained
in
the
d.c.
rape
statute.
both
the
majority
and
the
dissenting
opinion
below
recognized
that
under
the
prevailing
and
proper
interpretation
of
that
statute
overcoming
the
resistance
of
a
woman
by
placing
her
in
fear
of
death
were
serious
bodily
harm
was
equivalent
to
using
force
to
overcome
physical
resistance,
so
the
disagreement
centered
on
what
was
necessary
to
establish
fear.
mr.
samuel
huntington
yes
the
record
shows
mrs.
fooshie,
well,
mrs.
maze
the
complainant
testified
that
when
petitioner
returned
her
to
her
place
of
work,
she
went
in,
report
it
to
her
supervisor
and
told
her
of
the
crime.
mrs.
fooshie
testified,
the
supervisor,
testified
as
a
defense
witness
that
when
the
complainant
arrived,
she
first
ask
if
she
could
have
the
day
off.
she
first
said,
i
want
to
talk
to
you,
can
i
have
the
day
off.
i
don't
feel
fit
for
working.
she
testified
that
the
complainant
was
very
upset
and
very
nervous.
and
that
she
asked
the
complainant
to
come
in
to
the
backroom,
there
are
lots
of
people
in
the
hall
where
they
first
met,
and
that
in
the
backroom,
the
complainant
broke
down
and
told
of
the
crime.
mr.
samuel
huntington
the
--
there
is
no
evidence
that
there
are
any
guards
at
the
parking
lot.
there
may
have
been
one
guard
at
the
gate.
mr.
samuel
huntington
nothing
either
way.
there
is
evidence
that
petitioner
waited
until
one
car
had
parked
and
someone
had
gone
inside
before
pushing
the
car
in
to
the
lot.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well
the
--
as
soon
as
it
was
reported
to
the
supervisor,
they
reported
that
to
the
security
guards
at
the
hospital
who
then
called
in
the
police.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well
she
stayed
with
the
supervisor
as
soon
as
she
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
her
initial
complaint
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
that's
right.
mr.
samuel
huntington
that's
right,
yes
sir.
now
the
evidence
on
fear,
i
think
is
certainly
sufficient
to
support
this
verdict.
mrs.
maze
repeatedly
testified
that
she
was
scared
to
death
and
that
she
thought
petitioner
was
going
to
kill
her.
she
also
testified
that
he
stated
that
if
she
--
she
didn't
scream,
he
wouldn't
hurt
her.
he
also
--
there
is
also
some
objective
testimony
and
that
she
testified
that
he
recognized
she
was
nervous.
that
he
told
her
that
he
knew
she
was
scared
because
she
was
so
nervous.
well
under
all
of
these
circumstances,
i
won't
belabor
the
point.
the
resolution
of
this
issue
we
believe
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct.
first
of
all
involving
an
interpretation
of
the
d.c.
statute
as
it
does
on
the
issue
of
law,
this
court
has
traditionally
deferred
to
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
local
d.c.
matters
and
we
think
they
should
do
so
here
on
the
issue
of
fact.
the
jury
finding
was
concurred
in
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
we
don't
believe
this
court
should
consider
the
matter
further.
mr.
samuel
huntington
5
to
4.
mr.
samuel
huntington
yes.
mr.
samuel
huntington
four
of
them
thought
the
evidence
was
too
thin
but
they
didn't
base
it
on
credibility.
they
based
it
more
on
the
interpretation
on
what
is
necessary
to
shelf
here.
mr.
samuel
huntington
what
was
legally
necessary
to
establish
fear
as
a
substitute
for
force
under
the
d.c.
statute.
mr.
samuel
huntington
right.
the
final
argument
petitioner
raises
here
relates
to
the
prosecutors
characterization
during
summation
of
petitioner's
defenses
as
inconsistent.
he
argues
that
his
defenses
were
alternate
in
denying
intercourse
on
the
one
hand
and
arguing
that
the
government
had
not
established
non-consent.
however,
the
petitioner
did
offer
evidence
on
the
consent
issue.
he
offered
the
evidence,
that
mrs.
fooshie,
the
hospital
supervisor.
and
she
testified
that
mrs.
maze
had
first
asked
for
leave.
that
can
only
be
relevant
on
the
issue
of
consent.
mrs.
fooshie
however,
further
testified
in
direct
contradiction
of
the
defenses
theory
that
intercourse
had
not
taken
place.
she
placed
the
arrival
of
mrs.
maze
at
the
hospital
at
7:30
whereas
petitioner
had
testified
that
he
had
left
her
office
at
6:45
and
another
witness
testified
that
petitioner
was
home
by
7:00.
so,
really
petitioner
was
arguing
inconsistent
defenses.
even
if
the
prosecutor's
isolated
remarks
here
were
somewhat
in
excess,
this
case
is
no
way
comparable
to
the
burger
case,
the
1935
decision
of
this
court
reversing
for
prosecutorial
misconduct
where
the
misconduct
there
pervaded
the
entire
trial
and
included
many
different
items.
and
i
just
--
will
close
in
noting
that
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
district
of
columbia
examines
very
closely
charges
of
prosecutorial
misconduct
as
the
case
united
states
against
stevenson,
that's
424
f.2d.
923.
they
cite
a
whole
bunch
of
cases
there
in
which
they
have
examined
it
but
neither
the
majority
nor
the
dissent
in
this
case,
felt
called
upon
and
comment
on
this
issue.
in
conclusion
we
submit
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
samuel
huntington
mr.
justice
black
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government's
basic
position
in
this
case
is
that
no
prejudice
resulted
to
petitioner
from
the
trial
of
his
case
as
a
capital
case.
mr.
samuel
huntington
we
do
make
that
argument
at
some
length
in
our
brief
and
i
had
planned
to
refer
to
it
briefly.
i
think
it
is
set
forth
quite
adequately
in
our
brief.
the
main
thrust
of
petitioner's
argument
here
is
that
the
instructions
to
the
jury
on
the
death
penalty
issue
may
have
interfered
with
the
jury's
deliberations
on
the
issue
of
guilt.
and
heavy
reliance
is
placed
on
this
court's
decision
last
term
in
price
v.
georgia
in
the
1966
second
circuit's
opinion
in
the
hetenyi
v.
wilkins.
those
cases
of
course
involve
the
double
jeopardy
problem
of
retrying
a
person
for
murder
after
he
had
been
found
guilty
only
if
the
lesser
included
defense
and
that
conviction
had
been
upset
on
appeal.
the
analogy
petitioner
seeks
to
draw
between
the
price
and
wilkins
situations
in
this
case
are
unsound
for
several
different
reasons.
first
reason
is
that
--
in
each
of
the
former
cases,
the
murder
charge
was
one
of
the
principle
issues,
perhaps
the
principle
issue
in
the
case.
each
prosecutor
had
sought
to
establish
first-degree
murder
and
the
jury's
deliberations
on
the
defendant's
guilt
in
those
cases
would
necessarily
center
in
and
focus
on
that
first-degree
murder
charge.
by
contrast,
the
death
penalty
issue
in
this
case
played
a
very
insignificant
role.
some
statistics
are
worthy
of
note.
since
1930,
only
three
persons
have
been
executed
for
rape
in
the
district
of
columbia,
the
last
one
occurring
in
1949.
as
far
as
i
could
discover,
no
jury
has
imposed
a
death
penalty
in
a
rape
case
since
the
1950's
and
at
least
in
the
last
several
years,
the
government
has
not
sought
to
impose
the
death
penalty.
turning
to
this
case,
the
prosecutor
specifically
stated
during
voir
dire
that
he
was
not
seeking
the
death
penalty.
after
the
voir
dire,
neither
the
prosecutor
nor
petitioner's
trial
counsel
again
referred
to
the
death
penalty
issues.
in
a
summation,
the
prosecutor
merely
requested
a
verdict
of
guilty
as
charged.
and
then
of
course
during
the
charge
to
the
jury,
the
judge
twice
repeated
that
the
government
was
not
seeking
the
death
penalty.
nor
that
the
evidence
presented
by
the
government
make
it
likely
that
the
jury
would
seriously
consider
imposing
the
death
penalty.
this
was
not
a
case
of
aggravated
rape.
petitioner's
argument
on
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
really
cuts
two
ways
here.
he
argues
that
the
evidence
did
not
really
establish
none
consent
but
we
maintain
that
the
closer
the
evidences
on
the
consent
issue,
the
less
likely
it
is
that
the
government
would
--
that
the
jury
would
seriously
consider
imposing
the
death
penalty.
mr.
samuel
huntington
this
part
of
my
argument
is
based
on
that
premise.
we
do
argue
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
yes.
mr.
samuel
huntington
yes.
mr.
samuel
huntington
that's
right.
they
did
not
specifically
refer
the
harmless
error
test.
but
this
whole
argument
i'm
making
now,
i
think
supports
the
finding
that
a
petitioner
was
not
prejudiced
but
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
we're
now
turning
to
this
compromise
contention.
we
believe
that
that
is
also
the
analogy
with
price
and
wilkins
doesn't
exist.
in
price
and
wilkins,
there
was
the
choice
of
first-degree
murder,
second-degree
murder,
or
voluntary
manslaughter
and
not
guilty.
before
the
jury
could
unanimously
return
a
verdict
of
guilty
of
the
second
of
the
lesser
included
defense
which
they
did
in
both
price
and
wilkins,
the
juries
holding
out
for
not
guilty
had
to
give
up
their
insistence
on
that
verdict
and
the
guilty
is
whole
--
the
jury
is
holding
out
for
first-degree
murder
had
to
give
up
their
existence
on
that
verdict.
so
obviously
there
was
a
possibility
of
compromise.
as
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out
that
that
does
not
exist
here.
the
jurors
did
not
have
to
agree
on
the
death
penalty
issue
so
that
in
order
to
return
a
verdict
of
guilty,
if
it's
not
necessary
that
the
jurors
might
have
thought
that
they
should
impose
a
death
penalty,
give
up
anything.
obviously,
if
they
were
in
favor
of
imposing
the
death
penalty,
they
would
believe
in
petitioner's
guilt.
so
the
same
dynamics
that
existed
in
the
same
potential
for
compromise
just
don't
exist
here.
turning
now
to
the
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
he
does
make
that
point
here.
he
made
it
in
his
opening
brief
and
in
his
reply
brief.
he
quotes
the
first
full
paragraph
at
the
top
of
page
298
of
the
appendix
which
does
say
that
if
you
do
not
wish
to
have
the
death
penalty
imposed
or
if
you're
unable
to
agree,
then
you
should
merely
return
a
verdict
of
guilty.
however
if
you
go
back
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
i
think
--
i
read
in
isolation,
you
can
with
that
interpretation
on
it.
i
think
if
you
read
the
last
two
paragraphs
in
the
bottom
of
page
297
in
conjunction
with
that,
it's
perfectly
clear
that
the
trial
judge
instructed
the
jury
to
first
of
all
determine
the
guilt
question.
if
he
so
said
that
if
you
find
him
not
guilty,
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
if
you
find
him
guilty,
then
you
can
go
on
and
consider
the
death
penalty
issue
which
the
government
has
not
sought
to
impose
and
if
you're
unable
to
agree
there,
then
you
return
the
guilty
verdict.
i
don't
really
think
that
this
charge
is
ambiguous
on
that
point
at
all.
petitioner
also
alleges
in
his
brief,
he
didn't
refer
to
it
in
argument.
mr.
lippman
didn't
refer
to
it
that
the
fact
that
the
jury
was
death
qualified
may
have
prejudiced
petitioner
on
the
issue
of
guilt.
well,
to
begin
with
the
jury
in
this
case
was
not
truly
death
qualified
and
that
the
prosecutor
did
not
seek
to
obtain
a
jury
which
would
return
the
death
penalty.
the
prosecutor
merely
sought
to
--
merely
sought
to
have
a
jury
which
would
be
unbiased
on
the
issue
of
guilt.
in
his
sole
question
to
the
jurors
was
whether
their
views
on
capital
punishment
would
interfere
with
their
ability
to
return
a
verdict
of
guilty
if
the
evidence
so
compelled.
one
witness
was
excused.
now
several
decisions
of
this
court
have
established
that
the
exclusion
of
persons
for
views
of
--
on
capital
punishment
cannot
be
held
to
--
that
the
evidence
simply
is
insufficient
to
hold
that
that
would
bias,
make
the
jury
prosecution
prone.
the
witherspoon
case
so
held
in
bumper
and
north
carolina,
the
same
result
was
reached.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
pope
v.
united
states
involving,
decided
under
jackson
involving
the
jackson-type
decision.
the
jury
was
death
qualified.
he
--
pope
received
the
death
penalty
but
in
remanding
this
case,
this
case
simply
remanded
for
re-sentencing,
therefore,
impliedly
holding
that
pope
was
not
prejudiced
on
the
question
of
guilt,
although
that
point
was
argued.
i
would
like
briefly
to
refer
to
the
remaining
points
made
in
petitioner's
brief.
he
argues
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
that
that
issue
actually
involves
both
questions
of
fact
and
law.
the
legal
question
involves
a
proper
interpretation
of
the
phrase
forcibly
and
against
her
will
as
contained
in
the
d.c.
rape
statute.
both
the
majority
and
the
dissenting
opinion
below
recognized
that
under
the
prevailing
and
proper
interpretation
of
that
statute
overcoming
the
resistance
of
a
woman
by
placing
her
in
fear
of
death
were
serious
bodily
harm
was
equivalent
to
using
force
to
overcome
physical
resistance,
so
the
disagreement
centered
on
what
was
necessary
to
establish
fear.
mr.
samuel
huntington
yes
the
record
shows
mrs.
fooshie,
well,
mrs.
maze
the
complainant
testified
that
when
petitioner
returned
her
to
her
place
of
work,
she
went
in,
report
it
to
her
supervisor
and
told
her
of
the
crime.
mrs.
fooshie
testified,
the
supervisor,
testified
as
a
defense
witness
that
when
the
complainant
arrived,
she
first
ask
if
she
could
have
the
day
off.
she
first
said,
i
want
to
talk
to
you,
can
i
have
the
day
off.
i
don't
feel
fit
for
working.
she
testified
that
the
complainant
was
very
upset
and
very
nervous.
and
that
she
asked
the
complainant
to
come
in
to
the
backroom,
there
are
lots
of
people
in
the
hall
where
they
first
met,
and
that
in
the
backroom,
the
complainant
broke
down
and
told
of
the
crime.
mr.
samuel
huntington
the
--
there
is
no
evidence
that
there
are
any
guards
at
the
parking
lot.
there
may
have
been
one
guard
at
the
gate.
mr.
samuel
huntington
nothing
either
way.
there
is
evidence
that
petitioner
waited
until
one
car
had
parked
and
someone
had
gone
inside
before
pushing
the
car
in
to
the
lot.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well
the
--
as
soon
as
it
was
reported
to
the
supervisor,
they
reported
that
to
the
security
guards
at
the
hospital
who
then
called
in
the
police.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well
she
stayed
with
the
supervisor
as
soon
as
she
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
her
initial
complaint
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
that's
right.
mr.
samuel
huntington
that's
right,
yes
sir.
now
the
evidence
on
fear,
i
think
is
certainly
sufficient
to
support
this
verdict.
mrs.
maze
repeatedly
testified
that
she
was
scared
to
death
and
that
she
thought
petitioner
was
going
to
kill
her.
she
also
testified
that
he
stated
that
if
she
--
she
didn't
scream,
he
wouldn't
hurt
her.
he
also
--
there
is
also
some
objective
testimony
and
that
she
testified
that
he
recognized
she
was
nervous.
that
he
told
her
that
he
knew
she
was
scared
because
she
was
so
nervous.
well
under
all
of
these
circumstances,
i
won't
belabor
the
point.
the
resolution
of
this
issue
we
believe
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct.
first
of
all
involving
an
interpretation
of
the
d.c.
statute
as
it
does
on
the
issue
of
law,
this
court
has
traditionally
deferred
to
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
local
d.c.
matters
and
we
think
they
should
do
so
here
on
the
issue
of
fact.
the
jury
finding
was
concurred
in
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
we
don't
believe
this
court
should
consider
the
matter
further.
mr.
samuel
huntington
5
to
4.
mr.
samuel
huntington
yes.
mr.
samuel
huntington
four
of
them
thought
the
evidence
was
too
thin
but
they
didn't
base
it
on
credibility.
they
based
it
more
on
the
interpretation
on
what
is
necessary
to
shelf
here.
mr.
samuel
huntington
what
was
legally
necessary
to
establish
fear
as
a
substitute
for
force
under
the
d.c.
statute.
mr.
samuel
huntington
right.
the
final
argument
petitioner
raises
here
relates
to
the
prosecutors
characterization
during
summation
of
petitioner's
defenses
as
inconsistent.
he
argues
that
his
defenses
were
alternate
in
denying
intercourse
on
the
one
hand
and
arguing
that
the
government
had
not
established
non-consent.
however,
the
petitioner
did
offer
evidence
on
the
consent
issue.
he
offered
the
evidence,
that
mrs.
fooshie,
the
hospital
supervisor.
and
she
testified
that
mrs.
maze
had
first
asked
for
leave.
that
can
only
be
relevant
on
the
issue
of
consent.
mrs.
fooshie
however,
further
testified
in
direct
contradiction
of
the
defenses
theory
that
intercourse
had
not
taken
place.
she
placed
the
arrival
of
mrs.
maze
at
the
hospital
at
7:30
whereas
petitioner
had
testified
that
he
had
left
her
office
at
6:45
and
another
witness
testified
that
petitioner
was
home
by
7:00.
so,
really
petitioner
was
arguing
inconsistent
defenses.
even
if
the
prosecutor's
isolated
remarks
here
were
somewhat
in
excess,
this
case
is
no
way
comparable
to
the
burger
case,
the
1935
decision
of
this
court
reversing
for
prosecutorial
misconduct
where
the
misconduct
there
pervaded
the
entire
trial
and
included
many
different
items.
and
i
just
--
will
close
in
noting
that
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
district
of
columbia
examines
very
closely
charges
of
prosecutorial
misconduct
as
the
case
united
states
against
stevenson,
that's
424
f.2d.
923.
they
cite
a
whole
bunch
of
cases
there
in
which
they
have
examined
it
but
neither
the
majority
nor
the
dissent
in
this
case,
felt
called
upon
and
comment
on
this
issue.
in
conclusion
we
submit
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
