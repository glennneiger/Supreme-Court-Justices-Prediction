unknown

mr.
lippman,
may
i
ask?
is
what
you
apprehend
may
have
happened
is
that
some
jurors
would
say
“well,
he
is
guilty
but
if
you're
going
to
give
him
the
death
penalty,
i'm
going
to
vote
to
acquit
because
i
simply
can't
give
him
the
death
penalty.”
and
that
therefore
the
jurors
agreed.
well
that's
--
find
him
guilty
without
giving
him
the
death
penalty.
is
that
the
sort
of
thing
you're
concerned
may
have
happened?
unknown
speaker
i
gather
under
the
district
system
as
it
then
was.
it's
been
changed
since,
hasn't
it?
but
is
it
then
was,
if
everyone
agreed
he
was
guilty.
he'd
have
to
get
life
under
a
guilty
verdict
unless
everyone
also
agreed,
he
should
get
death,
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
whatever
it
is
but
my
point
is
he
couldn't
get
death
even
though
every
one
agreed
he
was
guilty.
he
could
not
get
death
unless
everyone
also
agreed
he
should
get
death,
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
that's
the
way
it
worked.
unknown
speaker
are
you
going
to
argue
that
jackson
v.
united
states
does
not
invalidate
this
system?
