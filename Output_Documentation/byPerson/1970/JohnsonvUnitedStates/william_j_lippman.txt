mr.
william
j.
lippman
mr.
justice
black
and
may
it
please
this
court.
this
case
presents
the
question
of
the
effect
of
a
constitutionally
invalid
death
sentence
instruction
upon
petitioner's
conviction
for
rape
under
the
district
of
columbia
rape
statute
where
the
evidence
of
guilt
was
not
compelling.
briefly
the
facts,
petitioner
was
convicted
largely
on
the
testimony
of
the
complaining
witness
who
testified
that
she
was
on
her
way
to
work
on
january
22,
1967
at
saint
elizabeth's
hospital
when
her
car
broke
down
in
front
of
a
gas
station.
she
went
to
the
gas
station
to
seek
help.
petitioner
drove
into
the
same
gas
station
purely
by
happenstance.
he
volunteered
to
push
the
petitioner's
car
to
the
parking
lot
at
saint
elizabeth's
hospital.
she
accepted
his
offer.
upon
arrival
at
the
parking
lot,
she
testified
that
he
forced
her
into
his
car
and
drove
off.
shortly
thereafter,
they
stopped
at
a
gas
station
where
he
purchased
a
dollar's
worth
of
gas.
there
was
an
attendant
present.
she
made
no
outcry.
no
effort
whatsoever
to
seek
the
assistance
of
the
attendant.
they
then
drove
off
to
a
secluded
spot.
they
talked
for
awhile.
he
asked
whether
she
was
married,
she
said
yes.
he
asked
whether
she
loved
her
husband,
she
said
no.
he
then
asked
her
to
remove
her
underclothes.
she
proceeded
to
do
so
without
any
protest.
following
which,
an
act
of
intercourse
took
place.
after
the
act
of
intercourse,
at
her
request
he
drove
her
back
to
the
--
to
work
to
the
saint
elizabeth's
parking
lot.
she
gave
him
her
car
keys.
he
gave
her
his
correct
phone
number.
he
promised
to
return
that
afternoon
to
help
start
her
car.
he
did
return
that
afternoon
when
he
was
promptly
arrested
and
charged
with
rape.
throughout
the
entire
episode,
the
complaining
witness
offered
no
protest
or
resistance
by
word
or
action
because
she
said
she
was
in
fear
for
her
life.
she
testified
that
she
suffered
from
a
thyroid
condition
but
no
medical
testimony
was
adduced
to
corroborate
this
point.
the
complaining
witness
was
unmarked.
there
was
no
evidence
of
force
other
than
her
own
testimony
that
she
was
in
fear
for
her
life.
petitioner
took
the
stand
in
his
own
defense,
admitted
that
he
pushed
the
complaining
witness
his
car
to
the
lot
but
denied
the
act
of
intercourse.
petitioner
was
indicted
and
tried
under
the
provisions
of
28
--
d.c.
code
2801
which
is
reproduced
on
page
3
of
our
brief
which
gives
a
jury
discretion
to
sentence
a
defendant
to
death
for
the
crime
of
rape.
at
the
outset
of
the
trial,
the
prosecution
announced
that
the
case
was
a
capital
case.
but
that
the
government
was
not
seeking
of
the
death
penalty.
nevertheless,
the
case
was
tried
before
a
death
qualified
jury
with
one
juror
being
excused
because
she
stated
that
her
opposition
to
capital
punishment
will
prevent
her
from
returning
a
verdict
of
guilty
if
as
a
consequence,
petitioner
might
be
sentenced
to
death.
the
court
judged
the
jury
that
even
though
the
government
was
not
seeking
the
death
penalty,
it
was
free
to
sentence
petitioner
to
death
if
they
found
them
guilty
and
that
if
they
were
unable
to
agree
that
the
death
penalty
should
be
imposed,
they
should
merely
return
a
verdict
of
guilty
and
the
court
would
impose
an
appropriate
penalty.
a
portion
of
the
charge
with
respect
to
the
death
penalty
is
set
forth
at
pages
297
and
298
of
the
appendix.
petitioner
was
found
guilty
and
sentenced
to
a
term
of
imprisonment
from
6
to
18
years.
his
direct
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
william
j.
lippman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
jury
was
out
two
and
a
half
hours,
i
believe,
or
more
particularly,
two
hours
and
twenty
minutes.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
i
don't
believe
so
mr.
harlan
--
mr.
justice
harlan.
his
direct
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
was
pending
when
the
court's
--
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
v.
jackson
390
u.s.
573
was
handed
down.
the
court
of
appeals
panel
which
heard
the
appeal
affirmed
the
petitioner
conviction
with
senior
judge
fahy
dissenting.
petitioner's
conviction
was
again
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
rehearing
en
banc
in
a
divided
opinion.
four
of
the
judges
on
the
court
of
appeals
dissented
on
the
ground
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient
to
sustain
petitioner's
conviction
and
three,
disserted
on
the
additional
ground
that
petitioner
was
prejudiced
by
the
trial
of
this
case
as
a
capital
case.
if
the
court
please,
petitioner
here
contends
that
his
conviction
violates
this
court's
holding
in
the
jackson
case
and
that
he
was
tried
for
a
capital
offense
when
he
should
not
have
been.
more
particularly,
it
is
our
contention
that
the
death
sentence
instruction
gave
the
jury
an
impermissible
choice
of
verdicts
which
might
have
resulted
in
a
compromise
verdict
in
this
case.
petitioner's
principle
contention
here
is
eloquently
stated
in
the
dissent
of
judge
fahy
below.
after
quoting
with
approval
from
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
marshall,
then
circuit
court
--
then
circuit
judge
marshall
--
excuse
me
your
honor.
in
the
hetenyi
versus
wilkins
case,
judge
fahy
states
and
i'm
quoting
from
the
appendix
at
page
346,
“we
cannot
surmise,
there
was
no
likelihood
of
the
jury
considering
the
availability
to
them
of
the
death
sentence.
we
have
no
basis
for
such
a
surmise.
and
it
is
the
erroneous
availability
of
the
death
sentence,
not
the
likelihood
of
its
rendition
that
gives
rise
to
the
prejudice.
it
may
have
exerted
an
indiscernible
influence
on
jurors
in
deciding
whether
to
find
guilt
but
without
the
death
sentence
or
not
guilty.
one
or
more
jurors
with
his
or
her
attitude
about
the
crime
of
rape
reinforced
by
the
statutory
provision
for
a
death
sentence
might
have
been
so
influenced.”
as
stated
by
the
second
circuit
in
wilkins,
supra,
348
f.2d
at
867,
“it
is
sufficient
if
there
is
a
reasonable
possibility
of
prejudice
for
the
court
erroneously
to
give
the
jury
a
range
of
verdicts
more
severe
than
the
law
allows
in
the
case
on
trial
is
for
the
court
erroneously
to
influence
the
jury
adversely
to
the
accuse.”
as
result,
the
verdict
rendered
maybe
more
severe
then
otherwise
it
would
have
been
even
if
not
the
most
severe
committed
by
the
erroneous
instruction.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
we
say
it
was
error
mr.
justice
black
because
the
charge
gave
the
jury
a
choice
of
three
verdicts.
it
gave
them
the
choice
of
a
verdict
of
not
guilty,
of
guilty
as
charge,
or
of
guilty
with
the
death
penalty.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
we
say
it
was
error
because
under
this
court's
decision
in
jackson,
the
trial
of
this
case
is
a
capital
case
including
the
death
sentence
charge
while
updated
the
petitioner's
constitutional
rights
and
he
was
prejudice
thereby
mr.
justice
--
mr.
william
j.
lippman
well,
the
constitutional
rights
to
which
he
was
--
to
be
protected
under
the
rationale
of
this
court's
decision
in
jackson.
jackson
holds
that
he
was
by
electing
to
stand
trial
by
jury.
he
was
exposed
to
greater
punishment
than
he
would
have
been
if
he
had
waived
his
right
to
a
jury
trial
or
pleaded
guilty
and
this
was
the
constitutional
defect
which
voided
the
penalty
scheme
in
the
kidnapping
act
and
the
same
scheme
was
incorporated
in
the
d.c.
rape
statute.
only
the
jury
under
the
d.c.
rape
statute
could
sentence
a
defendant
to
death.
so
to
that
extent
we
have
an
analogous
situation
to
jackson.
now,
--
mr.
william
j.
lippman
yes,
mr.
justice
marshall.
they
returned
a
verdict
of
guilty
but
without
the
death
penalty.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
because
the
charge,
mr.
justice
marshall,
gave
them
an
additional
option.
it
gave
them
the
right
to
return
a
verdict
of
guilty
with
the
death
penalty
as
we
read
the
statute.
they
were
really
three
possibilities
here
and
the
guilty
as
charged
verdict
could
be
construed
as
a
verdict
of
guilty
on
the
lesser
included
offense.
if
the
jury
had
returned
a
verdict
of
guilty
with
the
death
penalty,
that
could
have
been
similar
to
aggravated
rape,
ordinary
rape
perhaps
guilty
as
charged,
or
not
guilty.
those
were
the
three
options,
as
the
charge
clearly
indicates.
they
had
three
possible
alternatives
here.
now
it's
possible
in
that
situation
for
one
jury
to
feel,
well
let's
sentence
this
defendant
to
death.
another
juror
to
feel,
well
we
should
acquit
him.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
well,
we
can
--
mr.
william
j.
lippman
mr.
justice
marshall,
--
mr.
william
j.
lippman
that
is
entirely
correct
mr.
justice
harlan,
i'm
glad
that
you
made
the
point
sir,
because
we're
not
arguing
this
contention
any
abstract,
we're
arguing
it
with
reference
to
this
close
case
of
guilt
in
--
mr.
william
j.
lippman
6
to
18
years
mr.
justice
harlan,
he
is
now
serving
his
sentence
at
lorton
reformatory,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
he
served
three
years.
he
is
eligible
for
parole
in
--
at
the
fall
of
1973.
we
believe
that
the
rationale
of
the
fahy
dissent
has
indeed
been
adopted
in
this
court's
opinion
in
price
v.
georgia
decided
last
term.
here,
the
petitioner
was
subjected
to
trial
for
a
capital
offense
and
expose
to
the
hazards
of
capital
punishment.
but
the
same
as
was
the
petitioner
in
price
v.
georgia
and
that
the
death
sentence
instruction
here
gave
the
prosecution
the
advantage
of
offering
the
jury
a
choice,
a
situation
which
is
up
to
induce
the
jury
to
strike
a
compromise
rather
than
to
continue
to
debate
his
innocence.
now,
if
i
may
just
respond
to
mr.
justice
marshall's
observation
a
minute
ago.
true,
the
jury
was
out
two
hours
and
a
half.
it's
not
a
very
long
time.
it's
quite
possible
to
speculate
that
they
did
not
seriously
consider
the
death
sentence.
but
it's
impossible
to
rule
out
that
possibility.
and
this
is
where
no
one
can
say
by
hindsight
what
actually
happened
in
that
jury
rule
as
part
of
the
jury
deliberation
so
long
as
it
was
an
option
tended
in
the
charge
to
the
jury.
it's
got
to
be
credited
as
a
realistic
possibility.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
again
the
test
is
not
as
you
would
read
it
or
as
i
would
read
it
but
as
the
impact
that
had
upon
the
jury.
let
me
just
read
the
critical
portion
of
the
charge
mr.
justice
harlan,
starting
at
the
bottom
of
297
of
the
joint
appendix.
“if
however,
you
are
convinced
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
defendant
is
guilty
of
the
crime
of
rape
then
the
statute
provides
that
you
may,
if
you
unanimously
agreed
to
do
so,
recommend
to
the
court
that
the
death
penalty
attached.”
the
government
is
not
seeking
the
death
penalty.
i
repeat,
the
government
is
not
seeking
the
death
penalty.
“but
you
may
if
you
wish
to
do
so,”
add
the
words
with
the
death
penalty
to
your
guilty
verdict
if
you
find
him
guilty.
now
this
following
paragraph,
i
regard
as
quite
critical.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
no.
i
think
he
had
the
--
i
think
he
had
to
charge
the
jury
in
accordance
with
the
statute,
that's
what
the
statute
provided
at
the
time.
then
he
goes
on
to
say
“if
you
do
not
wish
to
have
the
death
penalty
imposed
or
if
you
are
unable
to
agree
that
the
death
penalty
should
be
imposed,
then
you
should
merely
return
a
verdict
of
guilty.”
now
how
does
that
language
strike
the
jury?
isn't
he
really
saying,
isn't
it
a
possible
interpretation
that
he's
telling
the
jury?
well,
if
you
don't
feel
this
crime
is
heinous
enough
or
bad
enough
or
the
defendant
is
--
should
be
killed,
should
be
put
to
death,
they
just
find
him
guilty.
now
the
jury
retry
it
to
the
jury
rule
with
those
instructions.
there
is
no
part
of
the
trial
which
is
of
grave
or
importance
in
the
determination,
in
the
guilt-determining
process
in
the
court's
charge.
i
refer
the
court
respectively
to
--
respectfully
to
the
language
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
andres
v.
united
states
in
his
concurring
opinion
333
u.s.
740
at
765.
“charging
a
jury
is
not
a
matter
of
abracadabra.
no
part
of
the
conduct
of
a
criminal
trial
as
a
heavier
task
upon
the
presiding
judge.
the
charge
is
that
part
of
the
whole
trial
which
probably
exercises
the
weightiest
influence
upon
jurors.”
so
here
we
have
a
situation
where
the
jurors
are
given
an
impermissible
option,
an
impermissible
consideration.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
well,
it
was
voided
and
made
an
illegal
charge
by
this
court's
decision
in
jackson,
mr.
justice
black,
by
virtue
of
the
statutory
scheme.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
no,
united
states
versus
jackson.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
united
states
versus
jackson.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
harlan?
mr.
william
j.
lippman
i
believe
he
was
in
his
late
20's
at
the
time,
27
or
28
mr.
william
j.
lippman
it
was
partly
male
and
female,
mr.
justice
harlan.
it
was
not
an
all
male
jury.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
the
victim
was
i
believe
in
her
late
30's
or
around
40
and
the
record
also
shows
that
they
were
the
same
physical
size.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
no,
they
were
both
members
of
the
black
race,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
my
concern
is
that
the
availability
of
the
death
sentence
option
might
have
led
to
a
compromise
resulting
in
the
guiltiest
charge
verdict
by
getting
a
possible
hold
out
who
wanted
to
acquit.
to
agree
that
he
would
return,
go
along
with
the
majority
and
find
the
defendant
guilty
as
charged
provided
no
death
penalty
were
imposed.
in
other
words,
as
a
quid
pro
quo
for
rejecting
the
death
sentence
alternative,
a
holdout
who
wanted
to
acquit
might
have
been
won
over.
that's
the
way
we
view
the
compromised
verdict
possibilities
here
and
again
we
are
talking
about
possibilities
not
probabilities
because
i
don't
think
it's
a
province
of
the
court
or
counsel
or
anybody
as
a
part
of
a
rationalization
after
the
fact
to
say
what
exactly
was
in
the
minds
of
the
jury.
this
court
has
been
in
certain
spec
and
refusing
to
do
--
engage
in
such
an
exercise.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
i
believe
the
statute
provides
for
imprisonment
up
to
30
years.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
it
had
to
be
unanimous
either
way.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
it
had
to
be
a
verdict
of
guilty
with
the
death
penalty.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
affirmatively.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
that
is
right.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
i
believe
that's
a
fair
construction
of
the
statute
and
by
the
same
talking
of
--
mr.
william
j.
lippman
i
believe
that
again
mr.
justice
brennan,
it's
impossible
to
say
where
that
--
where
the
pressure
comes
from.
they
might
just
as
readily
have
been
holdout
that
wanted
to
acquit
who
was
one
over
to
the
middle
ground
because
of
the
availability
of
the
death
sentence
--
mr.
william
j.
lippman
i'm
sorry
i
don't
understand
the
question
mr.
justice
white,
or
who
had
to
do
it.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
all
who
had
to
do
it?
the
court
had
--
mr.
william
j.
lippman
it's
still
might
have
been
away
of
avoiding
a
hung
jury.
the
compromise
might
have
been
reached
as
a
method
of
avoiding
a
hung
jury.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
well,
you're
assuming
mr.
justice
white
that
there
was
divisions
in
the
reasoning
of
the
jury.
i
cannot
really
join
in
that
assumption.
i
think
they
would
--
under
the
statute
and
under
the
charge
if
they
were
confronted
with
the
patent
of
again
of
three
possibilities.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
but
it
was
a
unitary
procedure
and
a
unitary
verdict
was
called
for.
it
wasn't
a
two-step
procedure.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
not
automatically.
up
to
--
mr.
william
j.
lippman
up
to
30
years
mr.
justice
brennan.
yes,
that
would
certainly
a
possibility.
i
should
like
to
close
my
direct
argument
and
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
with
this
quote
from
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
jackson
v.
denno,
378
u.s.
3867,
an
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
white
where
the
following
language
appears,
“for
we
cannot
determine
how
the
jury
resolve
these
issues
and
will
not
assume
that
they
will
reliably
and
properly
resolve
against
the
accused.”
that's
this
case.
thank
you.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
just
a
few
brief
points
mr.
justice
black,
first
with
reference
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
comments
with
regard
to
the
evidence.
this
petitioner
was
convicted
on
the
basis
of
the
testimony
of
the
complaining
witness
which
while
it
might
have
been
corroborated
with
respect
to
the
act
of
intercourse
was
not
corroborated
in
our
judgment
with
respect
to
the
consent
issue.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
coltrane
case,
coltrane
v.
united
states
418
f2d.
1131
which
was
decided
after
this
case
initially,
talks
about
the
element
of
corroboration
on
all
elements
of
the
offense.
we
maintain
that
that
element
of
corroboration
was
missing
here.
now,
if
the
court
please,
this
record
in
its
entire
--
in
its
entirety
cannot
be
read
without
getting
the
feeling
that
there
has
been
some
kind
of
miscarriage
of
justice
here.
this
was
true
at
the
point
of
trial
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
point
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinions,
at
a
5
to
4
split.
it's
particularly
true
now
that
we
have
the
issues
of
the
united
states
v.
jackson
violation
and
the
price
case.
we
feel
that
this
case
does
come
under
the
reasoning
of
the
price
case
but
we're
not
asking
this
court
to
make
any
broad
pronouncement
of
constitutional
significance
here.
this
court
can
exercise
its
supervisory
powers
over
the
federal
courts
and
reverse
its
conviction
if
it
feels
that
has
been
substantial
error
or
substantial
in
justice
below.
as
regards,
the
point
made
by
mr.
huntington
so
far
as
the
statistics
are
concerned.
of
course
the
jury
didn't
know
how
many
rape
defendants
had
been
sentenced
to
death.
it's
impossible
to
impute
this
knowledge
into
the
minds
of
the
jury.
i
think
we'll
be
making
a
basic
mistake
by
assuming
that
the
only
issue
here
is
the
issue
of
the
death
sentence
instruction
and
how
it
affected
the
jury's
deliberations.
we
have
a
broad
issue
in
that
the
defendant
was
tried
for
a
capital
offense
when
he
shouldn't
have
been
and
he
was
exposed
to
all
the
incidence
of
a
capital
trial.
this
court
has
recognized
the
distinction
between
being
tried
for
a
capital
offense
and
other
offenses.
indeed,
it
was
recognized
in
the
opinion
in
price
v.
georgia.
in
which
i
think
in
price
v.
georgia
the
court
said
that
to
be
charged
with
a
capital
offense,
of
course
that
went
off
on
double
jeopardy
but
they
did
say
that
it's
an
ordeal
not
to
be
viewed
lightly,
the
language
of
this
court
in
price
v.
georgia.
thank
you
for
your
attention.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
thank
you
very
much
mr.
--
mr.
william
j.
lippman
thank
you
very
much
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
mr.
justice
black
and
may
it
please
this
court.
this
case
presents
the
question
of
the
effect
of
a
constitutionally
invalid
death
sentence
instruction
upon
petitioner's
conviction
for
rape
under
the
district
of
columbia
rape
statute
where
the
evidence
of
guilt
was
not
compelling.
briefly
the
facts,
petitioner
was
convicted
largely
on
the
testimony
of
the
complaining
witness
who
testified
that
she
was
on
her
way
to
work
on
january
22,
1967
at
saint
elizabeth's
hospital
when
her
car
broke
down
in
front
of
a
gas
station.
she
went
to
the
gas
station
to
seek
help.
petitioner
drove
into
the
same
gas
station
purely
by
happenstance.
he
volunteered
to
push
the
petitioner's
car
to
the
parking
lot
at
saint
elizabeth's
hospital.
she
accepted
his
offer.
upon
arrival
at
the
parking
lot,
she
testified
that
he
forced
her
into
his
car
and
drove
off.
shortly
thereafter,
they
stopped
at
a
gas
station
where
he
purchased
a
dollar's
worth
of
gas.
there
was
an
attendant
present.
she
made
no
outcry.
no
effort
whatsoever
to
seek
the
assistance
of
the
attendant.
they
then
drove
off
to
a
secluded
spot.
they
talked
for
awhile.
he
asked
whether
she
was
married,
she
said
yes.
he
asked
whether
she
loved
her
husband,
she
said
no.
he
then
asked
her
to
remove
her
underclothes.
she
proceeded
to
do
so
without
any
protest.
following
which,
an
act
of
intercourse
took
place.
after
the
act
of
intercourse,
at
her
request
he
drove
her
back
to
the
--
to
work
to
the
saint
elizabeth's
parking
lot.
she
gave
him
her
car
keys.
he
gave
her
his
correct
phone
number.
he
promised
to
return
that
afternoon
to
help
start
her
car.
he
did
return
that
afternoon
when
he
was
promptly
arrested
and
charged
with
rape.
throughout
the
entire
episode,
the
complaining
witness
offered
no
protest
or
resistance
by
word
or
action
because
she
said
she
was
in
fear
for
her
life.
she
testified
that
she
suffered
from
a
thyroid
condition
but
no
medical
testimony
was
adduced
to
corroborate
this
point.
the
complaining
witness
was
unmarked.
there
was
no
evidence
of
force
other
than
her
own
testimony
that
she
was
in
fear
for
her
life.
petitioner
took
the
stand
in
his
own
defense,
admitted
that
he
pushed
the
complaining
witness
his
car
to
the
lot
but
denied
the
act
of
intercourse.
petitioner
was
indicted
and
tried
under
the
provisions
of
28
--
d.c.
code
2801
which
is
reproduced
on
page
3
of
our
brief
which
gives
a
jury
discretion
to
sentence
a
defendant
to
death
for
the
crime
of
rape.
at
the
outset
of
the
trial,
the
prosecution
announced
that
the
case
was
a
capital
case.
but
that
the
government
was
not
seeking
of
the
death
penalty.
nevertheless,
the
case
was
tried
before
a
death
qualified
jury
with
one
juror
being
excused
because
she
stated
that
her
opposition
to
capital
punishment
will
prevent
her
from
returning
a
verdict
of
guilty
if
as
a
consequence,
petitioner
might
be
sentenced
to
death.
the
court
judged
the
jury
that
even
though
the
government
was
not
seeking
the
death
penalty,
it
was
free
to
sentence
petitioner
to
death
if
they
found
them
guilty
and
that
if
they
were
unable
to
agree
that
the
death
penalty
should
be
imposed,
they
should
merely
return
a
verdict
of
guilty
and
the
court
would
impose
an
appropriate
penalty.
a
portion
of
the
charge
with
respect
to
the
death
penalty
is
set
forth
at
pages
297
and
298
of
the
appendix.
petitioner
was
found
guilty
and
sentenced
to
a
term
of
imprisonment
from
6
to
18
years.
his
direct
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
william
j.
lippman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
jury
was
out
two
and
a
half
hours,
i
believe,
or
more
particularly,
two
hours
and
twenty
minutes.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
i
don't
believe
so
mr.
harlan
--
mr.
justice
harlan.
his
direct
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
was
pending
when
the
court's
--
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
v.
jackson
390
u.s.
573
was
handed
down.
the
court
of
appeals
panel
which
heard
the
appeal
affirmed
the
petitioner
conviction
with
senior
judge
fahy
dissenting.
petitioner's
conviction
was
again
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
rehearing
en
banc
in
a
divided
opinion.
four
of
the
judges
on
the
court
of
appeals
dissented
on
the
ground
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient
to
sustain
petitioner's
conviction
and
three,
disserted
on
the
additional
ground
that
petitioner
was
prejudiced
by
the
trial
of
this
case
as
a
capital
case.
if
the
court
please,
petitioner
here
contends
that
his
conviction
violates
this
court's
holding
in
the
jackson
case
and
that
he
was
tried
for
a
capital
offense
when
he
should
not
have
been.
more
particularly,
it
is
our
contention
that
the
death
sentence
instruction
gave
the
jury
an
impermissible
choice
of
verdicts
which
might
have
resulted
in
a
compromise
verdict
in
this
case.
petitioner's
principle
contention
here
is
eloquently
stated
in
the
dissent
of
judge
fahy
below.
after
quoting
with
approval
from
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
marshall,
then
circuit
court
--
then
circuit
judge
marshall
--
excuse
me
your
honor.
in
the
hetenyi
versus
wilkins
case,
judge
fahy
states
and
i'm
quoting
from
the
appendix
at
page
346,
“we
cannot
surmise,
there
was
no
likelihood
of
the
jury
considering
the
availability
to
them
of
the
death
sentence.
we
have
no
basis
for
such
a
surmise.
and
it
is
the
erroneous
availability
of
the
death
sentence,
not
the
likelihood
of
its
rendition
that
gives
rise
to
the
prejudice.
it
may
have
exerted
an
indiscernible
influence
on
jurors
in
deciding
whether
to
find
guilt
but
without
the
death
sentence
or
not
guilty.
one
or
more
jurors
with
his
or
her
attitude
about
the
crime
of
rape
reinforced
by
the
statutory
provision
for
a
death
sentence
might
have
been
so
influenced.”
as
stated
by
the
second
circuit
in
wilkins,
supra,
348
f.2d
at
867,
“it
is
sufficient
if
there
is
a
reasonable
possibility
of
prejudice
for
the
court
erroneously
to
give
the
jury
a
range
of
verdicts
more
severe
than
the
law
allows
in
the
case
on
trial
is
for
the
court
erroneously
to
influence
the
jury
adversely
to
the
accuse.”
as
result,
the
verdict
rendered
maybe
more
severe
then
otherwise
it
would
have
been
even
if
not
the
most
severe
committed
by
the
erroneous
instruction.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
we
say
it
was
error
mr.
justice
black
because
the
charge
gave
the
jury
a
choice
of
three
verdicts.
it
gave
them
the
choice
of
a
verdict
of
not
guilty,
of
guilty
as
charge,
or
of
guilty
with
the
death
penalty.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
we
say
it
was
error
because
under
this
court's
decision
in
jackson,
the
trial
of
this
case
is
a
capital
case
including
the
death
sentence
charge
while
updated
the
petitioner's
constitutional
rights
and
he
was
prejudice
thereby
mr.
justice
--
mr.
william
j.
lippman
well,
the
constitutional
rights
to
which
he
was
--
to
be
protected
under
the
rationale
of
this
court's
decision
in
jackson.
jackson
holds
that
he
was
by
electing
to
stand
trial
by
jury.
he
was
exposed
to
greater
punishment
than
he
would
have
been
if
he
had
waived
his
right
to
a
jury
trial
or
pleaded
guilty
and
this
was
the
constitutional
defect
which
voided
the
penalty
scheme
in
the
kidnapping
act
and
the
same
scheme
was
incorporated
in
the
d.c.
rape
statute.
only
the
jury
under
the
d.c.
rape
statute
could
sentence
a
defendant
to
death.
so
to
that
extent
we
have
an
analogous
situation
to
jackson.
now,
--
mr.
william
j.
lippman
yes,
mr.
justice
marshall.
they
returned
a
verdict
of
guilty
but
without
the
death
penalty.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
because
the
charge,
mr.
justice
marshall,
gave
them
an
additional
option.
it
gave
them
the
right
to
return
a
verdict
of
guilty
with
the
death
penalty
as
we
read
the
statute.
they
were
really
three
possibilities
here
and
the
guilty
as
charged
verdict
could
be
construed
as
a
verdict
of
guilty
on
the
lesser
included
offense.
if
the
jury
had
returned
a
verdict
of
guilty
with
the
death
penalty,
that
could
have
been
similar
to
aggravated
rape,
ordinary
rape
perhaps
guilty
as
charged,
or
not
guilty.
those
were
the
three
options,
as
the
charge
clearly
indicates.
they
had
three
possible
alternatives
here.
now
it's
possible
in
that
situation
for
one
jury
to
feel,
well
let's
sentence
this
defendant
to
death.
another
juror
to
feel,
well
we
should
acquit
him.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
well,
we
can
--
mr.
william
j.
lippman
mr.
justice
marshall,
--
mr.
william
j.
lippman
that
is
entirely
correct
mr.
justice
harlan,
i'm
glad
that
you
made
the
point
sir,
because
we're
not
arguing
this
contention
any
abstract,
we're
arguing
it
with
reference
to
this
close
case
of
guilt
in
--
mr.
william
j.
lippman
6
to
18
years
mr.
justice
harlan,
he
is
now
serving
his
sentence
at
lorton
reformatory,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
he
served
three
years.
he
is
eligible
for
parole
in
--
at
the
fall
of
1973.
we
believe
that
the
rationale
of
the
fahy
dissent
has
indeed
been
adopted
in
this
court's
opinion
in
price
v.
georgia
decided
last
term.
here,
the
petitioner
was
subjected
to
trial
for
a
capital
offense
and
expose
to
the
hazards
of
capital
punishment.
but
the
same
as
was
the
petitioner
in
price
v.
georgia
and
that
the
death
sentence
instruction
here
gave
the
prosecution
the
advantage
of
offering
the
jury
a
choice,
a
situation
which
is
up
to
induce
the
jury
to
strike
a
compromise
rather
than
to
continue
to
debate
his
innocence.
now,
if
i
may
just
respond
to
mr.
justice
marshall's
observation
a
minute
ago.
true,
the
jury
was
out
two
hours
and
a
half.
it's
not
a
very
long
time.
it's
quite
possible
to
speculate
that
they
did
not
seriously
consider
the
death
sentence.
but
it's
impossible
to
rule
out
that
possibility.
and
this
is
where
no
one
can
say
by
hindsight
what
actually
happened
in
that
jury
rule
as
part
of
the
jury
deliberation
so
long
as
it
was
an
option
tended
in
the
charge
to
the
jury.
it's
got
to
be
credited
as
a
realistic
possibility.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
again
the
test
is
not
as
you
would
read
it
or
as
i
would
read
it
but
as
the
impact
that
had
upon
the
jury.
let
me
just
read
the
critical
portion
of
the
charge
mr.
justice
harlan,
starting
at
the
bottom
of
297
of
the
joint
appendix.
“if
however,
you
are
convinced
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
defendant
is
guilty
of
the
crime
of
rape
then
the
statute
provides
that
you
may,
if
you
unanimously
agreed
to
do
so,
recommend
to
the
court
that
the
death
penalty
attached.”
the
government
is
not
seeking
the
death
penalty.
i
repeat,
the
government
is
not
seeking
the
death
penalty.
“but
you
may
if
you
wish
to
do
so,”
add
the
words
with
the
death
penalty
to
your
guilty
verdict
if
you
find
him
guilty.
now
this
following
paragraph,
i
regard
as
quite
critical.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
no.
i
think
he
had
the
--
i
think
he
had
to
charge
the
jury
in
accordance
with
the
statute,
that's
what
the
statute
provided
at
the
time.
then
he
goes
on
to
say
“if
you
do
not
wish
to
have
the
death
penalty
imposed
or
if
you
are
unable
to
agree
that
the
death
penalty
should
be
imposed,
then
you
should
merely
return
a
verdict
of
guilty.”
now
how
does
that
language
strike
the
jury?
isn't
he
really
saying,
isn't
it
a
possible
interpretation
that
he's
telling
the
jury?
well,
if
you
don't
feel
this
crime
is
heinous
enough
or
bad
enough
or
the
defendant
is
--
should
be
killed,
should
be
put
to
death,
they
just
find
him
guilty.
now
the
jury
retry
it
to
the
jury
rule
with
those
instructions.
there
is
no
part
of
the
trial
which
is
of
grave
or
importance
in
the
determination,
in
the
guilt-determining
process
in
the
court's
charge.
i
refer
the
court
respectively
to
--
respectfully
to
the
language
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
andres
v.
united
states
in
his
concurring
opinion
333
u.s.
740
at
765.
“charging
a
jury
is
not
a
matter
of
abracadabra.
no
part
of
the
conduct
of
a
criminal
trial
as
a
heavier
task
upon
the
presiding
judge.
the
charge
is
that
part
of
the
whole
trial
which
probably
exercises
the
weightiest
influence
upon
jurors.”
so
here
we
have
a
situation
where
the
jurors
are
given
an
impermissible
option,
an
impermissible
consideration.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
well,
it
was
voided
and
made
an
illegal
charge
by
this
court's
decision
in
jackson,
mr.
justice
black,
by
virtue
of
the
statutory
scheme.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
no,
united
states
versus
jackson.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
united
states
versus
jackson.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
harlan?
mr.
william
j.
lippman
i
believe
he
was
in
his
late
20's
at
the
time,
27
or
28
mr.
william
j.
lippman
it
was
partly
male
and
female,
mr.
justice
harlan.
it
was
not
an
all
male
jury.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
the
victim
was
i
believe
in
her
late
30's
or
around
40
and
the
record
also
shows
that
they
were
the
same
physical
size.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
no,
they
were
both
members
of
the
black
race,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
my
concern
is
that
the
availability
of
the
death
sentence
option
might
have
led
to
a
compromise
resulting
in
the
guiltiest
charge
verdict
by
getting
a
possible
hold
out
who
wanted
to
acquit.
to
agree
that
he
would
return,
go
along
with
the
majority
and
find
the
defendant
guilty
as
charged
provided
no
death
penalty
were
imposed.
in
other
words,
as
a
quid
pro
quo
for
rejecting
the
death
sentence
alternative,
a
holdout
who
wanted
to
acquit
might
have
been
won
over.
that's
the
way
we
view
the
compromised
verdict
possibilities
here
and
again
we
are
talking
about
possibilities
not
probabilities
because
i
don't
think
it's
a
province
of
the
court
or
counsel
or
anybody
as
a
part
of
a
rationalization
after
the
fact
to
say
what
exactly
was
in
the
minds
of
the
jury.
this
court
has
been
in
certain
spec
and
refusing
to
do
--
engage
in
such
an
exercise.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
i
believe
the
statute
provides
for
imprisonment
up
to
30
years.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
it
had
to
be
unanimous
either
way.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
it
had
to
be
a
verdict
of
guilty
with
the
death
penalty.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
affirmatively.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
that
is
right.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
i
believe
that's
a
fair
construction
of
the
statute
and
by
the
same
talking
of
--
mr.
william
j.
lippman
i
believe
that
again
mr.
justice
brennan,
it's
impossible
to
say
where
that
--
where
the
pressure
comes
from.
they
might
just
as
readily
have
been
holdout
that
wanted
to
acquit
who
was
one
over
to
the
middle
ground
because
of
the
availability
of
the
death
sentence
--
mr.
william
j.
lippman
i'm
sorry
i
don't
understand
the
question
mr.
justice
white,
or
who
had
to
do
it.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
all
who
had
to
do
it?
the
court
had
--
mr.
william
j.
lippman
it's
still
might
have
been
away
of
avoiding
a
hung
jury.
the
compromise
might
have
been
reached
as
a
method
of
avoiding
a
hung
jury.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
well,
you're
assuming
mr.
justice
white
that
there
was
divisions
in
the
reasoning
of
the
jury.
i
cannot
really
join
in
that
assumption.
i
think
they
would
--
under
the
statute
and
under
the
charge
if
they
were
confronted
with
the
patent
of
again
of
three
possibilities.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
but
it
was
a
unitary
procedure
and
a
unitary
verdict
was
called
for.
it
wasn't
a
two-step
procedure.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
not
automatically.
up
to
--
mr.
william
j.
lippman
up
to
30
years
mr.
justice
brennan.
yes,
that
would
certainly
a
possibility.
i
should
like
to
close
my
direct
argument
and
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
with
this
quote
from
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
jackson
v.
denno,
378
u.s.
3867,
an
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
white
where
the
following
language
appears,
“for
we
cannot
determine
how
the
jury
resolve
these
issues
and
will
not
assume
that
they
will
reliably
and
properly
resolve
against
the
accused.”
that's
this
case.
thank
you.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
just
a
few
brief
points
mr.
justice
black,
first
with
reference
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
comments
with
regard
to
the
evidence.
this
petitioner
was
convicted
on
the
basis
of
the
testimony
of
the
complaining
witness
which
while
it
might
have
been
corroborated
with
respect
to
the
act
of
intercourse
was
not
corroborated
in
our
judgment
with
respect
to
the
consent
issue.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
coltrane
case,
coltrane
v.
united
states
418
f2d.
1131
which
was
decided
after
this
case
initially,
talks
about
the
element
of
corroboration
on
all
elements
of
the
offense.
we
maintain
that
that
element
of
corroboration
was
missing
here.
now,
if
the
court
please,
this
record
in
its
entire
--
in
its
entirety
cannot
be
read
without
getting
the
feeling
that
there
has
been
some
kind
of
miscarriage
of
justice
here.
this
was
true
at
the
point
of
trial
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
point
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinions,
at
a
5
to
4
split.
it's
particularly
true
now
that
we
have
the
issues
of
the
united
states
v.
jackson
violation
and
the
price
case.
we
feel
that
this
case
does
come
under
the
reasoning
of
the
price
case
but
we're
not
asking
this
court
to
make
any
broad
pronouncement
of
constitutional
significance
here.
this
court
can
exercise
its
supervisory
powers
over
the
federal
courts
and
reverse
its
conviction
if
it
feels
that
has
been
substantial
error
or
substantial
in
justice
below.
as
regards,
the
point
made
by
mr.
huntington
so
far
as
the
statistics
are
concerned.
of
course
the
jury
didn't
know
how
many
rape
defendants
had
been
sentenced
to
death.
it's
impossible
to
impute
this
knowledge
into
the
minds
of
the
jury.
i
think
we'll
be
making
a
basic
mistake
by
assuming
that
the
only
issue
here
is
the
issue
of
the
death
sentence
instruction
and
how
it
affected
the
jury's
deliberations.
we
have
a
broad
issue
in
that
the
defendant
was
tried
for
a
capital
offense
when
he
shouldn't
have
been
and
he
was
exposed
to
all
the
incidence
of
a
capital
trial.
this
court
has
recognized
the
distinction
between
being
tried
for
a
capital
offense
and
other
offenses.
indeed,
it
was
recognized
in
the
opinion
in
price
v.
georgia.
in
which
i
think
in
price
v.
georgia
the
court
said
that
to
be
charged
with
a
capital
offense,
of
course
that
went
off
on
double
jeopardy
but
they
did
say
that
it's
an
ordeal
not
to
be
viewed
lightly,
the
language
of
this
court
in
price
v.
georgia.
thank
you
for
your
attention.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
lippman
thank
you
very
much
mr.
--
mr.
william
j.
lippman
thank
you
very
much
mr.
justice
black.
