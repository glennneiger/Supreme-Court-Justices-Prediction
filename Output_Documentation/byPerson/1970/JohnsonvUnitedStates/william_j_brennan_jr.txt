so,
if
you
had
a
situation
where
they
were
unanimous
that
he
was
guilty,
but
there
was
a
single
holdout
who
wouldn't
go
--
give
him
death
and
the
only
result
would
have
been
verdict
of
guilt
without
the
death
penalty,
isn't
that
right?
even
if
11
of
them
saw
he
ought
to
get
death
and
there
was
a
single
holdout,
although
all
the
12
agreed
he
was
guilty.
justice
william
j.

does
that
have
any
bearing
on
whether
or
not
there
was
this
kind
of
pressure
to
compromise
it
to
argue?
justice

they
were
clearly
told
of
the
instruction,
i
think
that
they
have

that
there
was
this
alternative
of

if
you
disagree
on
the
penalty,
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.

no,

in
their
deliberations
in
the
jury
room,
this
is
itself.
that
all
12
of
them
could
agree
that
he
was
guilty
and
11
of
them
might
have
sought
that
they
ought
to
have
the
death
penalty
but
the
12th
said
“no,
i
won't
give
him
death.”
and
the
only
verdict
they
could
return
and
would
have
been
a
proper
verdict
was
guilty
to
which
it
would
automatically
attach
the
30-year
sentence.
