justice
potter
stewart
you
know
that’s
interesting
to
be
--
justice
potter
stewart
any
difference
between
you
and
your
brother
on
the
other
side
this
morning
as
to
this
issue.
he
agreed
that
federal
law
is
applicable?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
but
if
i
can
understand
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
language
he
said
so
in
his
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
there’s
no
issue
between
you
here
today
as
far
as
i
know.
justice
potter
stewart
what
about
the
normal
governmental
corporation
at
the
state
level,
say
a
housing
authority.
justice
potter
stewart
has
the
board
exercised
authority
in
that?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
about
it?
do
you
have
some
general
--
any
other
experience
with
local
governmental
corporations
that
are
spun
off
with
state
authority?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
wouldn’t
say
a
city
isn’t
a
state,
would
you?
justice
potter
stewart
you
wouldn’t
say
a
city
isn’t
the
state,
it
is
interstate.
justice
potter
stewart
what
about
a
home
rule
city
where
the
state
has
any
business
for
any
local
affairs
whatsoever?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
that
the
state
doesn’t
exercise
any
day
to
day
control.
isn’t
really
determinative,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
to
the
state?
i
thought
you
said
the
city
is
the
state.
i
mean,
you'd
look
at
the
city
as
a
political
subdivision.
justice
potter
stewart
whether
the
state
has
got
any
control
over
it
or
not.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
why
isn’t
an
irrigation
authority
or
water
district
in
a
political
subdivision,
the
state
says
it
is,
this
is
an
entity
that’s
doing
a
job
the
state
is
authorized
to
do
and
the
state
has
chosen
instrumentality
to
do
it
through.
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
got
a
statute
on
the
books.
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
would
say
that
a
municipal
or
--
a
municipality
that
sets
up
a
separate
municipal
corporation
to
conduct,
to
own
and
operate
its
electrical
and
water
system.
justice
potter
stewart
would
not
be
a
political
subdivision?
justice
potter
stewart
but
what’s
the
distinction
for
having
to
say
so?
justice
potter
stewart
the
city
just
creates
pursuant
to
a
state
law,
a
separate
municipal
corporation
which
condemns
and
then
operates
the
formally
private
electrical
system.
justice
potter
stewart
same
building,
same
job
that’s
done
before,
same
employees
and
the
board
of
directors
of
this
separate
municipal
corporation
runs
it.
justice
potter
stewart
if
enacted
--
the
state
of
tennessee,
specifically
created
this
specific
corporation.
justice
potter
stewart
and
assigned
you
in
doing
these
specific
functions(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
well,
this
corporation
is
created
by
a
statute
whereas
provided
for
the
board
of
directors
and
that
the
federal
--
justice
potter
stewart
why
is
the
board
of
directors
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
i
noticed
though
that
so
many
of
these
very
districts
in
tennessee
have
been
held
to
be
exempt
by
a
regional
director.
justice
potter
stewart
i
might
say
were
weekly
in
peril
in
denton
county,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
but
the
--
isn’t
that
the
holding
now?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
is
it
then
a
fact
that
weekly
in
benton
and
carroll
counties,
they
are
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board?
justice
potter
stewart
can
i
ask
mr.
manoli,
what's
the
crux
of
the
board's
position
that
you
reached
as
outside
the
exemption
for
political
subdivision,
any
agency
even
though
it
performed
as
a
local
governmental
function
so
long
as
that
agency
is
a
creature
not
run
by
the
state
legislature
or
some
executive
line
with
the
state,
but
it
comes
in
to
being
only
if
local
citizens
create
it,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
the
crux
of
the
board’s
position?
justice
potter
stewart
of
the
distinction
you
made?
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
know.
but
what's
brought
within
the
board’s
jurisdiction?
what’s
the
mark
of
such
an
entity
that
is
within
the
board’s
jurisdiction?
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
they
are
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
as
i
understand
it,
this
kind
of
entity
is
created
only
if
a
group
of
local
citizens
get
together
and
decide
to
create
it.
justice
potter
stewart
isn’t
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
not
created
whether
they
like
it
or
not
by
a
legislature
or
by
any
other
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
my
question
is,
is
that
the
way
we’re
to
distinguish
entities
within
from
entities
without
the
board's
jurisdiction,
whether
or
not
local
citizens,
it
comes
into
being
only
if
local
citizens
take
some
action.
justice
potter
stewart
or
is
that
an
over
simplification
of
your
position?
justice
potter
stewart
the
county
judge
then
is
not
primarily
a
judicial
officer?
justice
potter
stewart
he
is
more
or
like
a
--
what
a
county
judge
is
in
missouri,
for
example?
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
elsewhere
called
a
county
commissioner?
justice
potter
stewart
how
are
the
personnel
of
the
district
employed?
justice
potter
stewart
how
are
the
personnel
of
the
district
employed?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
have
a
civil
service
system
in
tennessee?
justice
potter
stewart
are
these
employees
treated
on
the
basis
comparable
to
other
employees
of
the
county
or
the
cities
or
are
they
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
do
you
know?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
know
under
what
language
of
that
legislation?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
says
municipal
--
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
well
no
wonder
he
doesn’t
pay
any
income
taxes
if
it
has
no
income.
justice
potter
stewart
mhas
it
ever
before
you
proceeded,
has
it
ever
been
decided
whether
your
client
has
sovereign
immunity
as
a
defendant
in
a
tort
action
for
example.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
don’t
you
have
some
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
have
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
in
tennessee?
justice
potter
stewart
or
does
it
--
and
then
is
it
applicable
when
a
government
is
acting
in
a
proprietary
capacity,
that’s
a
distinction
we
used
to
have
in
ohio
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
was
just
curious,
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
you
know
that’s
interesting
to
be
--
justice
potter
stewart
any
difference
between
you
and
your
brother
on
the
other

this
morning
as
to
this
issue.
he
agreed
that
federal

is

justice
potter
stewart
(voice

but
if
i
can
understand
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
language
he
said
so
in
his

justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
there’s
no

between
you
here
today
as
far
as
i

justice
potter
stewart
what
about
the

say

justice
potter

has
the

justice

stewart
well,
what
about

do
you
have
some

any

that
are
spun

justice
potter
stewart
whether
the

has
got
any

over

or
not.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
why
isn’t
an
irrigation
authority
or
water
district
in
a
political
subdivision,
the
state
says
it
is,
this
is
an
entity
that’s
doing

the

the

justice

it’s
got

justice

so
you
would
say
that
a

a

that

justice

would
not

justice
potter
stewart
but
what’s
the

for
having
to
say

justice
potter
stewart
the
city
just
creates
pursuant
to
a

a

which
condemns

then
operates
the
formally

justice
potter
stewart
same
building,
same

that’s
done
before,
same

and
the
board
of
directors
of
this
separate
municipal

runs
it.
justice
potter
stewart
if

the

of
tennessee,
specifically
created
this

justice
potter
stewart
and

justice

stewart
well,
this

is
created
by
a

whereas
provided
for
the
board
of

and
that
the
federal
--
justice
potter
stewart
why
is
the
board

(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
i
noticed
though
that
so
many
of
these
very
districts
in
tennessee
have
been
held
to
be
exempt
by
a
regional
director.
justice
potter
stewart
i
might
say
were
weekly
in

in
denton
county,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
but
the
--
isn’t
that
the

now?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
is
it
then
a
fact
that
weekly
in
benton
and
carroll
counties,
they
are
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the

justice

can
i
ask

is

justice
potter
stewart
of
the
distinction
you
made?
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
know.
but
what's
brought
within
the
board’s
jurisdiction?
what’s
the
mark
of
such
an
entity
that
is
within
the
board’s
jurisdiction?
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
they
are
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
as
i
understand
it,
this
kind
of
entity
is
created
only
if
a

of
local

get

and
decide

justice

isn’t

it’s
