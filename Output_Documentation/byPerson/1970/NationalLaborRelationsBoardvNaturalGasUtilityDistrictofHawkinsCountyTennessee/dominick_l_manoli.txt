mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
sixth
circuit.
the
board
issued
its
order
directing
the
respondent
utility
district
to
bargain
collectively
with
the
union
which
a
--
the
voice
of
the
district
in
an
appropriate
unit
had
previously
designated
as
her
bargain
representative.
the
district
contending
that
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
tennessee
that
it
is
a
political
subdivision
for
an
arm
or
instrumentality
of
the
state
has
refused
to
comply
with
the
order.
the
statute
specifically
excludes
from
the
definition
of
the
term
employer,
the
united
states
or
any
state,
or
any
critical
subdivision
thereof.
the
two
questions
presented
here
are
first,
whether
for
purposes
of
the
labor
act,
federal
standards
or
state
law
governs
the
determination
whether
an
entity
is
a
political
subdivision
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
or
an
employer
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
secondly,
if
federal
standards
and
not
state
law
govern
that
determination
whether
boards
find
it
that
the
district
here
is
not
a
political
subdivision
within
the
meaning
of
the
labor
act
but
an
employer
is
entitled
to
affirmance.
the
court
below
rejecting
the
board’s
view
held
that
state
law
is
controlling
with
the
respect
of
the
determination
of
whether
an
entity
is
a
political
subdivision
or
not
and
on
the
basis
of
the
state,
the
code
of
the
state
of
tennessee
and
the
supreme
court’s
--
and
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
confirming
the
legislation.
it
held
that
the
district
here
was
a
political
subdivision
within
the
meaning
of
the
labor
act
and
therefore
not
an
employer.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
it
does.
there
are
cases
that
are
cited
in
our
brief
indicating
that
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
if
they
are
tennessee
cases,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
sir?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
it
is.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
eminent
domain
is
not
a
unique
characteristic
of
political
subdivisions.
private
concerns
quasi-public
you
might
say
have
been
given
that
sort
of
authority.
now,
i
want
to
summarize
perhaps
a
little
bit
more
at
length
than
i
normally
as
the
case
in
this
court.
i
do
want
to
summarize
one
of
the
facts,
custodian
facts
that
relate
to
the
district’s
status
as
an
employer
under
the
act
or
as
the
other
side
would
have
it
as
a
political
subdivision
under
the
act.
the
district
sells
and
distributes
natural
gas
without
profit
to
residential
homes,
commercial
businesses
and
industrial
firms
in
hopkins
county,
tennessee.
it
was
incorporated
in
december
1957
under
the
tennessee
utility
district
law.
under
the
provisions
of
that
law,
a
group
of
local
real
property
holders
in
hawkins
county
filed
a
petition
with
the
county
court
setting
forth
the
statement
of
the
need
for
the
service
to
be
supplied,
the
estimated
cost
and
the
names
of
free
local
residence
proposed
these
commissioners
of
the
district.
after
a
hearing,
the
chairman
of
the
county
court,
the
chairman
of
the
county
court
is
a
judge.
the
chairman
of
the
county
court
found
that
public
convenience
and
necessity
justified
the
creation
of
the
proposed
district
that
it
was
economically
sound
and
desirable
and
accordingly
granted
the
petition.
the
chairman
of
the
county
court
as
required
by
the
state
law
appointed
its
commissioners
of
the
newly
created
district,
the
three
persons
nominated
in
the
petition.
the
district
was
financed
through
the
private
sale
of
bonds
and
no
public
money
was
used.
the
district
constructed
a
natural
gas
distribution
system
with
the
proceeds
of
the
bond
sale.
under
the
statute,
the
gas
system
became
subject
to
a
lien
in
favor
of
the
bond
holders
until
the
debt
was
paid.
principal
and
interest
on
the
bonds
are
payable
solely
from
the
revenues
of
the
district.
the
rates
charged
by
the
district
must
be
sufficient
to
pay
its
expenses
and
as
bonded
in
datedness.
the
district
has
no
power
to
levy
or
collect
taxes
and
its
service
charges
are
not
to
be
construed
as
taxes.
the
powers
of
the
district
are
vested
in
and
exercised
by
three
member
board
of
commissioners.
the
commissioners
are
not
subject
to
county
or
state
regulations.
they
adopt
the
necessary
rules
and
regulations
and
set
the
district
service
fees.
they
control
the
labor
relations
of
the
district.
and
under
their
supervision,
the
manager
of
the
district
hires
and
fires
employees
and
sets
their
wages.
neither
the
state
nor
the
county
has
any
control
over
the
district’s
employees.
the
state
statute
also
gives
the
district
the
power
of
eminent
domain
as
the
chief
justice
has
already
alluded
to.
and
it
authorizes
the
board
of
commissioners
to
inquire
into
any
matter
relating
to
the
affairs
of
the
district
and
to
carry
out
this
function
to
issue
subpoenas
and
administer
oaths.
finally,
the
enabling
tennessee
statute
provides
that
a
utility
district
is
a
municipality
or
public
corporation
and
exemption
from
state,
county
or
local
taxation.
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
has
upheld
this
tax
exemption
on
the
ground
that
such
a
district
is
an
arm
or
an
instrumentality
of
the
state.
as
i
stated
earlier,
the
court
below
concluded
that
state
law
governs
the
determination
whether
an
entity
is
a
political
subdivision
or
not
and
under
the
laws
of
tennessee
as
confirmed
by
the
highest
court
of
that
state,
the
district
here
is
a
political
subdivision
and
therefore
refused
to
enforce
the
board's
bargaining
order.
the
fourth
circuit
on
the
other
hand
in
dealing
with
a
related
type
of
problem
has
rejected
the
contention
that
state
law
governs
the
determination
of
whether
an
entity
is
a
political
subdivision
or
not
and
as
held
the
federal
standards
govern
the
determination
of
whether
or
not
that
particular
entity
is
a
political
subdivision
or
not.
the
act
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
sir?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
i’m
not
entirely
sure
if
he
agrees
on
that.
but
of
course
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
there
is
the
court
below.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
court
below
of
course
took
it
a
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
had
not
fully
appreciated
that.
now,
both
the
act
and
this
legislative
history
are
silent
as
to
the
meaning
that
congress
sought
to
attribute
to
the
phrase
political
subdivision
of
a
state.
the
obvious
purpose
of
course,
of
congress
was
to
avoid,
to
avoid
interference
and
to
the
labor
relations
the
employment
relations
of
--
between
a
governmental
entity
and
its
employees.
now,
i
shall
not
attempt
to
give
any
kind
of
a
comprehensive
definition
of
what
a
political
subdivision
is.
indeed
the
cases
tell
us,
the
cases
tell
us
that
an
entity
may
be
a
political
subdivision
for
purposes
of
one
statute
and
not
another.
now,
any
definition
of
a
political
subdivision
for
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
must
i
think
taken
to
account
the
basic
purpose
which
underlies
the
governmental
exemption
in
the
statute,
namely
the
avoidance
of
interference.
the
avoidance
of
interference
into
the
employment
and
labor
relations
between
a
state,
between
a
governmental
entity
and
its
employees.
so
therefore
the
threshold
question
in
this
case
as
it
was
in
the
missouri
transit
workers
case
decided
by
this
court
several
years
ago.
the
threshold
question
in
this
case
here,
do
we
have
that
kind
of
state
involvement
in
the
creation,
the
administration,
the
operation
and
particularly
the
labor
relations.
the
employment
relations
of
the
districts,
do
we
have
that
kind
of
state
involvement
here
that
should
bring
in
to
play,
should
bring
in
to
play
the
congressional
purpose
to
bar
the
labor
board
from
intruding,
from
intruding
into
the
labor
relations
of
a
governmental
entity.
i
submit
that
the
answer
to
that
question
is
that
we
do
not
have
that
kind
of
state
involvement.
the
state
did
not
directly
create
the
district.
it
was
formed
by
private
individuals.
it
is
not
administered
by
publicly
elected
officials
or
their
designees.
it
has
not
become
assimilated
or
incorporated
into
the
state
or
local
government
so
as
to
become
one
of
its
constituent
parts.
the
county
judge
exercises
no
independent
judgment
in
appointing
the
districts
commissioners
except
in
the
remote
contingency
that
two
of
the
commissioners
may
not
be
able
to
agree
on
filling
a
vacancy.
the
tennessee
statute
requires
him
to
appoint
those
persons
nominated
in
the
petition
filed
by
the
local
property
owners.
utility
system
is
owned
by
the
district
itself
and
is
not
state
property.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
there
are
three
commissioners
your
honor
and
they
serve
--
the
--
those
who
are
first
appointed
following
the
volume
of
this
petition,
the
affirmation
by
the
county
court.
they
served
as
i
recall
for
a
staggered
period
of
two,
three
and
four
years.
thereafter,
any
successors
would
serve
for
a
period
of
four
years,
as
far
as
i
recall.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
sir,
i’m
sorry,
i
didn’t
hear
it.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
there
is
in
tennessee
an
ouster
statute.
and
under
this
ouster
statute,
the
ouster
statute
provides
that
where
an
official
of
a
municipality
or
political
subdivision
is
failing
to
perform
his
duties
that
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
or
the
city
attorney
or
the
county
attorney
as
the
case
maybe,
may
bring
ouster
proceedings
in
court,
whether
any
such
power
has
ever
been
exercised
with
the
respect
to
any
of
these
districts
and
we
are
told
that
there
are
approximately
270
of
them
in
the
state
of
tennessee,
i
don’t
know.
now,
the
utility
system
is
owned
by
the
district
itself
and
is
not
state
property.
it
has
no
authority
to
levy
taxes
and
must
meet
its
expenses
and
obligations
from
its
revenues.
the
district
is
completely
autonomous
in
the
conduct
of
its
affairs.
the
state
exercises
no
supervisory
power
over
the
conduct
of
the
district's
day
to
day
affairs
or
its
operations.
indeed,
the
tennessee
statute
expressly
bars
any
state
public
utility
commission
from
exercising
any
jurisdiction
over
the
management
and
control
of
the
system
or
its
rates
or
charges.
finally,
the
district
alone
exercises
the
power
to
hire
and
fire
employees.
the
state
does
not
control
either
directly
or
indirectly
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
for
the
district
and
apparently
on
the
basis
of
a
decision
by
a
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
the
state
of
tennessee.
apparently
these
employees
are
not
deemed
to
be
subject
to
the
state
restrictions
applicable
to
the
state
or
municipal
employees
with
the
respect
to
strikes
and
picketing.
essentially,
the
district
appears
to
be
--
the
board
found
that
essentially
it’s
a
private
venture
to
be
sure
for
the
benefit
of
the
community
and
for
the
benefit
of
the
community
but
nonetheless
a
private
venture
having
no
identity
or
relationship
to
the
state.
now
of
course,
as
the
state
of
tennessee
as
seen
fit
to
its
legislature
to
characterize,
to
label
this
district
here
as
a
political
subdivision
of
the
state
as
a
municipality.
but
that
factor
cannot
be
dispositive
of
the
status
of
this
district
here
for
purposes
of
the
federal
legislation.
as
this
court
said
some
years
ago,
the
labor
act
is
a
federal
legislation
administered
by
a
national
agency
to
solve
a
national
problem
on
a
national
scale.
and
the
general
principle
is
that
normally
that
congress
intends
that
it's
law
shall
have
uniform
application
so
that
its
programs
would
not
be
impaired.
now,
of
course,
a
state
has
an
important
interest
in
defining
its
political
subdivision
and
the
board
of
course
pays
considerable
attention
to
the
state's
legitimate
interest
in
defining
its
political
subdivisions.
but
that
interest
it
seems
to
us
must
be
weighed,
must
be
weighed
against
the
policies
of
the
statute
and
the
uniform
application
of
those
policies
which
this
court
had
repeatedly
confirmed
congress
intended.
now,
local
considerations,
local
problems
may
prompt
a
state,
may
prompt
a
state
to
characterize
as
a
political
subdivision,
what
is
essentially
a
private
venture.
having
no
real
identity
or
relationship
to
the
state
and
over
which
a
state
exercises
no
control.
if
state
by
state
characterizations
of
an
entity
as
a
political
subdivision
were
to
be
determinative
of
the
problem,
then
the
result
might
well
be
a
patchwork
of
policies,
a
patchwork
of
policies
and
exemptions
from
the
provisions
of
the
statute
which
have
no
relation
to
the
underlying
purpose
of
the
governmental
exemption
in
the
statute,
namely
the
avoidance
of
interference
and
the
employment
in
labor
relations
between
a
governmental
entity
and
its
employees.
i
don’t
believe
(inaudible)
say
that
in
this
particular
case
that
the
state
of
tennessee
has
seen
fit
to
label
a
district
as
a
political
subdivision
not
because
it
really
regards
as
an
armed
or
instrumentality
or
a
department
of
the
state
but
rather
because
it
sought
to
give
us
some
kind
of
tax
exemption
and
thereby
encourage
you,
encourage
local
citizens,
local
property
holders
here
to
create
these
districts.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
housing
authority?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
board
has
never
had
that
case
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
there
had
been
a
number
of
cases
which
are
cited
in
our
brief
and
the
principle
which
the
board
has
applied
to
these
cases,
to
these
cases
and
of
course
it
turns
upon
the
particular
facts
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
sir?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
but
that’s
a
political
subdivision.
it’s
a
political
subdivision,
i
don’t
think
anybody
would
quarrel,
that
the
city
is
a
political
subdivision
specifically
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
but,
i
would
still
regard
that
as
being
a
political
subdivision
of
the
state.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
of
course
that’s
one
of
the
elements
of
this
problem
here
is
whether
or
not
there
is
that
kind
of
control.
you
don’t
single
out
any
particular
single
fact
but
as
a
whole.
what
do
you
have
here?
do
you
have
that
kind
of
connection,
that
kind
of
relationship
to
the
state
here?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
but
the
statute
specifically
exempts
a
political
subdivision
of
a
state.
i
mean,
that’s
what
the
statute
says.
and
i
don’t
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
the
state
has
not
really
chosen
that
your
honor
because
here,
it’s
been
a
group
of
private
--
it’s
been
a
group
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
stands
on
more
relevant
--
have
a
statute
on
the
books
just
like
an
incorporation
statute
which
permits
private
individuals
to
set
up
a
private
corporation.
and
this
is
really
not
much
different
than
that.
how
to
be
sure?
to
be
sure
this
particular
district
has
been
given
certain
advantages,
to
be
given
the
advantages
and
no
tax
and
no
taxation.
and
again
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
oh,
yes.
the
board
has
exempted
that
very
kind
of
a
district.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well
the
board
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well
your
honor,
the
board
has
taken
the
position
in
defining
the
term
political
subdivisions
under
the
statute
so
as
to
exclude,
so
as
to
limit,
so
as
to
limit
a
political
subdivision,
that
kind
of
an
entity
which
is
either
been
directly
created
by
the
state
so
that
it
is
either
a
department
of
the
state
or
not
or
the
administrative
arm
of
the
state
or
those
entities
which
are
administered
by
individuals
who
are
either
directly
responsible
to
publicly
elected
officials
or
to
the
electorate
at
large,
the
general
electorate.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
new
post
office,
the
new
post
office
corporation
your
honor?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
but
that’s
been
specifically
brought
under
the
federal
--
under
the
labor
act.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
i
don’t
know
precisely
what
the
setup
of
the
new
post
office
is,
but
the
statute
also
excludes
wholly
owned
government
corporations
whether
the
new
post
office
is
a
wholly
owned
government
corporation
or
not
but
in
any
event,
congress
under
the
new
legislation
has
specifically
brought
a
new
post
office
system
under
the
the
labor
act.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
think
not,
that’s
right.
because
it’s
been
directly
created
by
the
state
and
it’s
an
armed
department
of
--
an
arm
or
an
instrumentality
of
the
state
itself.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
suppose
that
the
crux
of
the
matter
is
how
closely
are
the
public
officials
identified
with
the
running
of
employment
and
labor
relations
of
the
particular
entity?
that’s
a
very
important
factor
in
this
type
of
case.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
in
this
case
here?
they’re
not
public
officials
because
they
are
nominated
in
the
petition
that’s
filed
by
the
property
owners
and
the
state
court.
the
county
court
has
no
discretion
with
respect
to
designating
them
as
the
commissioners.
the
county
court
has
only
the
opportunity
to
name
one
of
the
commissioners,
only
in
the
event,
if
there’s
a
vacancy
and
the
two
commissioners
cannot
agree.
so
the
state
does
not
appoint
the
commissioners
other
than
just
simply
ratifying
here
the
nominees
that
have
been
made
by
the
local
property
holders
in
their
original
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
sir?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
i
think
i
don’t
want
to
answer
that
question
categorically
because
school
systems
may
differ
as
to
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
i
don’t
want
to
say
or
give
any
categorical
answer
because
i
don’t
know
just
how
they
operate.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no.
over
the
years,
i
think
the
board
has
had
at
least
those
which
have
come
--
are
now
incorporated
in
these
official
records.
there
have
been
in
the
neighborhood
of
a
dozen
or
so
cases.
but
the
problem
however
though
is
much
broader
than
that
because
in
this
particular
state
for
example,
in
tennessee,
we
are
told
that
there
are
270
of
these
particular
districts.
now,
what
the
situation
maybe
in
other
states,
there
maybe
differences
of
course.
in
some
cases,
perhaps
the
district
similar
to
this
one
here
maybe
regarded
by
the
board
itself
as
a
political
subdivision,
here
is
not.
so
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
there
is
one
case
your
honor
and
i
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
we
have
that
case
and
of
course
that
was
only
a
regional
director
who
made
that
decision.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
there
was
never
any
appeal
from
that
decision
to
the
board
itself.
the
board
has
expressly
overruled
that
decision
of
the
regional
director,
the
holding
rather,
the
holding
of
regional
director
in
that
particular
case.
so
that
particular
case
has
no
more
presidential
value,
if
i
may
use
somewhat
exaggerated
example
then
the
decision
of
a
district
court,
after
this
court
had
come
down
with
a
decision
under
the
same
type
of
issue.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
if
the
union
were
to
seek
representation
or
if
somebody
was
fired
there.
that
somebody
was
fired
there
because,
let’s
say
he
became
a
union
member
and
the
charges
were
filed
with
us
today
or
a
representation
of
petitioner
was
filed
today,
that
regional
director
would
entertain
those
--
either
the
representation
petition
or
the
unfair
labor
practice
charge
on
the
merits.
he
would
be
bound
by
the
board.
he’s
bound
by
the
board
decision
in
this
area
of
course.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
know
of
no
such
case.
no
such
instances.
i
know
of
none.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
i
think
i
was
being
asked
the
question
of
whether
they
were
public
officials
and
it’s
been
a
long
time
since
i
was
associated
with
the
school
and
it
may
vary
perhaps
how
these
people
are
appointed
to
run
the
school
system
of
a
particular
area.
that
was
the
reason
for
my
hesitation.
my
hesitation
if
school
officials
are
appointed
by
the
city
and
the
school
as
a
part
of
the
city,
obviously
the
board
would
not
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
that
the
board
has
never
had
any
such
case
and
i
would
be
surprised
if
we
ever
entertained
any
such
case
as
that.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
crux
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
crux
of
the
board’s
position
is
this.
that
it
limits
the
term
political
subdivisions
to
those
entities
that
are
either
directly
created
by
the
state
so
as
to
constitute
either
a
department
or
administrative
arm
of
the
state
or
those
entities
where
the
individuals
administering
that
particular
entity
are
either
responsible
directly
to
publicly
elected
officials
or
to
the
general
electorate.
that’s
the
distinction
that
the
board
has
drawn.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
if
they
are
not
within
those
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i’m
not
sure
that
i
understand
your
question
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that’s
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
they
just
simply
in
the
name
of
the
statute.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
i
think
that
it
certainly
was
an
important
element
in
the
board’s
thinking
here
that
underlies
the
classification,
that
either
the
interpretation
of
the
political
subdivision
here.
but
what
the
board
is
looking
to
is
to
what
extent,
to
what
extent
if
it’s
a
political
subdivision
of
a
state
that
we’re
concerned,
to
what
extent
is
the
state
administering
that
particular
entity?
to
what
extent
has
the
state
become
involved?
to
what
extent
has
the
state
become
involved
in
the
operation,
the
administration
of
that
particular
entity
and
particularly
its
labor
and
employment
relationships.
and
where
you
have
the
case
such
as
we
have
here
where
there’s
simply
an
enabling
statute
which
permits
private
citizens
to
create
this
kind
of
a
district
with
all
the
various
characteristics
that
i
have
described
there.
the
board
says
“well,
we
don’t
have
that
kind
of
involvement.”
we
don’t
have
that
kind
of
involvement
by
the
state
that
should
bring
in
to
play
the
congressional
purpose
and
to
bar
the
labor
board
from
intruding
into
the
employment
or
labor
relations
of
our
governmental
entity
and
its
employees.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
they
can
also
--
under
this
local
statute,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
--
oh,
no,
the
board
doesn't
draw
a
distinction
between
gas
and
water
your
honor,
or
electricity.
it
depends
upon
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no
sir.
there
is
a
board
case
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
where
the
board
declined
to
assert
jurisdiction
over
a
gas
system
of
that
kind
that
your
honors
is
describing.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
it’s
not
so
much
a
question
of
distinguishing
between
what
kind
of
service,
what
is
water
or
gas
or
electricity
but
rather
it
goes
to
the
question,
what
is
the
entity
that
is
performing
that
service.
now,
in
the
case
that
i
referred
to
where
the
board
--
there,
the
gas
district
was
part
of
the
city,
of
the
city’s
operations,
it
was
run
by
a
board
of
the
utility
commissioners
i
recall
them
under
the
supervision
of
the
mayor.
and
the
city
had
financial
responsibility
for
the
operation
of
that
particular
gas
district
as
i
recall
it.
so
the
distinction
is
not
been
made
upon
whether
it's
water,
gas
or
electricity,
what
have
you,
but
what
is
the
nature
of
the
particular
corporation
or
entity
that
is
performing
this
kind
of
service
and
what
is
its
relationship?
what
is
relationship,
whatever
the
service
may
be,
water,
gas,
whatever,
what
is
its
relationship
to
the
state
government,
to
the
city
government
or
the
general
electorate
?thank
you.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
sir?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
record
is
silent
on
that
your
honor
and
all
that
i
have
--
all
--
there
is
no
state
law
as
far
as
i
know,
but
we
do
have
the
statement
of
the
manager
of
this
particular
district
here
who
testified,
that
neither
the
county
nor
the
state
has
any
control
all
over
the
labor
relations
of
this
particular
district.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
sixth
circuit.
the
board
issued
its
order
directing
the
respondent
utility
district
to
bargain
collectively
with
the
union
which
a
--
the
voice
of
the
district
in
an
appropriate
unit
had
previously
designated
as
her
bargain
representative.
the
district
contending
that
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
tennessee
that
it
is
a
political
subdivision
for
an
arm
or
instrumentality
of
the
state
has
refused
to
comply
with
the
order.
the
statute
specifically
excludes
from
the
definition
of
the
term
employer,
the
united
states
or
any
state,
or
any
critical
subdivision
thereof.
the
two
questions
presented
here
are
first,
whether
for
purposes
of
the
labor
act,
federal
standards
or
state
law
governs
the
determination
whether
an
entity
is
a
political
subdivision
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
or
an
employer
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
secondly,
if
federal
standards
and
not
state
law
govern
that
determination
whether
boards
find
it
that
the
district
here
is
not
a
political
subdivision
within
the
meaning
of
the
labor
act
but
an
employer
is
entitled
to
affirmance.
the
court
below
rejecting
the
board’s
view
held
that
state
law
is
controlling
with
the
respect
of
the
determination
of
whether
an
entity
is
a
political
subdivision
or
not
and
on
the
basis
of
the
state,
the
code
of
the
state
of
tennessee
and
the
supreme
court’s
--
and
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
confirming
the
legislation.
it
held
that
the
district
here
was
a
political
subdivision
within
the
meaning
of
the
labor
act
and
therefore
not
an
employer.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
it
does.
there
are
cases
that
are
cited
in
our
brief
indicating
that
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
if
they
are
tennessee
cases,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
sir?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
it
is.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
eminent
domain
is
not
a
unique
characteristic
of
political
subdivisions.
private
concerns
quasi-public
you
might
say
have
been
given
that
sort
of
authority.
now,
i
want
to
summarize
perhaps
a
little
bit
more
at
length
than
i
normally
as
the
case
in
this
court.
i
do
want
to
summarize
one
of
the
facts,
custodian
facts
that
relate
to
the
district’s
status
as
an
employer
under
the
act
or
as
the
other
side
would
have
it
as
a
political
subdivision
under
the
act.
the
district
sells
and
distributes
natural
gas
without
profit
to
residential
homes,
commercial
businesses
and
industrial
firms
in
hopkins
county,
tennessee.
it
was
incorporated
in
december
1957
under
the
tennessee
utility
district
law.
under
the
provisions
of
that
law,
a
group
of
local
real
property
holders
in
hawkins
county
filed
a
petition
with
the
county
court
setting
forth
the
statement
of
the
need
for
the
service
to
be
supplied,
the
estimated
cost
and
the
names
of
free
local
residence
proposed
these
commissioners
of
the
district.
after
a
hearing,
the
chairman
of
the
county
court,
the
chairman
of
the
county
court
is
a
judge.
the
chairman
of
the
county
court
found
that
public
convenience
and
necessity
justified
the
creation
of
the
proposed
district
that
it
was
economically
sound
and
desirable
and
accordingly
granted
the
petition.
the
chairman
of
the
county
court
as
required
by
the
state
law
appointed
its
commissioners
of
the
newly
created
district,
the
three
persons
nominated
in
the
petition.
the
district
was
financed
through
the
private
sale
of
bonds
and
no
public
money
was
used.
the
district
constructed
a
natural
gas
distribution
system
with
the
proceeds
of
the
bond
sale.
under
the
statute,
the
gas
system
became
subject
to
a
lien
in
favor
of
the
bond
holders
until
the
debt
was
paid.
principal
and
interest
on
the
bonds
are
payable
solely
from
the
revenues
of
the
district.
the
rates
charged
by
the
district
must
be
sufficient
to
pay
its
expenses
and
as
bonded
in
datedness.
the
district
has
no
power
to
levy
or
collect
taxes
and
its
service
charges
are
not
to
be
construed
as
taxes.
the
powers
of
the
district
are
vested
in
and
exercised
by
three
member
board
of
commissioners.
the
commissioners
are
not
subject
to
county
or
state
regulations.
they
adopt
the
necessary
rules
and
regulations
and
set
the
district
service
fees.
they
control
the
labor
relations
of
the
district.
and
under
their
supervision,
the
manager
of
the
district
hires
and
fires
employees
and
sets
their
wages.
neither
the
state
nor
the
county
has
any
control
over
the
district’s
employees.
the
state
statute
also
gives
the
district
the
power
of
eminent
domain
as
the
chief
justice
has
already
alluded
to.
and
it
authorizes
the
board
of
commissioners
to
inquire
into
any
matter
relating
to
the
affairs
of
the
district
and
to
carry
out
this
function
to
issue
subpoenas
and
administer
oaths.
finally,
the
enabling
tennessee
statute
provides
that
a
utility
district
is
a
municipality
or
public
corporation
and
exemption
from
state,
county
or
local
taxation.
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
has
upheld
this
tax
exemption
on
the
ground
that
such
a
district
is
an
arm
or
an
instrumentality
of
the
state.
as
i
stated
earlier,
the
court
below
concluded
that
state
law
governs
the
determination
whether
an
entity
is
a
political
subdivision
or
not
and
under
the
laws
of
tennessee
as
confirmed
by
the
highest
court
of
that
state,
the
district
here
is
a
political
subdivision
and
therefore
refused
to
enforce
the
board's
bargaining
order.
the
fourth
circuit
on
the
other
hand
in
dealing
with
a
related
type
of
problem
has
rejected
the
contention
that
state
law
governs
the
determination
of
whether
an
entity
is
a
political
subdivision
or
not
and
as
held
the
federal
standards
govern
the
determination
of
whether
or
not
that
particular
entity
is
a
political
subdivision
or
not.
the
act
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
sir?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
i’m
not
entirely
sure
if
he
agrees
on
that.
but
of
course
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
there
is
the
court
below.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
court
below
of
course
took
it
a
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
had
not
fully
appreciated
that.
now,
both
the
act
and
this
legislative
history
are
silent
as
to
the
meaning
that
congress
sought
to
attribute
to
the
phrase
political
subdivision
of
a
state.
the
obvious
purpose
of
course,
of
congress
was
to
avoid,
to
avoid
interference
and
to
the
labor
relations
the
employment
relations
of
--
between
a
governmental
entity
and
its
employees.
now,
i
shall
not
attempt
to
give
any
kind
of
a
comprehensive
definition
of
what
a
political
subdivision
is.
indeed
the
cases
tell
us,
the
cases
tell
us
that
an
entity
may
be
a
political
subdivision
for
purposes
of
one
statute
and
not
another.
now,
any
definition
of
a
political
subdivision
for
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
must
i
think
taken
to
account
the
basic
purpose
which
underlies
the
governmental
exemption
in
the
statute,
namely
the
avoidance
of
interference.
the
avoidance
of
interference
into
the
employment
and
labor
relations
between
a
state,
between
a
governmental
entity
and
its
employees.
so
therefore
the
threshold
question
in
this
case
as
it
was
in
the
missouri
transit
workers
case
decided
by
this
court
several
years
ago.
the
threshold
question
in
this
case
here,
do
we
have
that
kind
of
state
involvement
in
the
creation,
the
administration,
the
operation
and
particularly
the
labor
relations.
the
employment
relations
of
the
districts,
do
we
have
that
kind
of
state
involvement
here
that
should
bring
in
to
play,
should
bring
in
to
play
the
congressional
purpose
to
bar
the
labor
board
from
intruding,
from
intruding
into
the
labor
relations
of
a
governmental
entity.
i
submit
that
the
answer
to
that
question
is
that
we
do
not
have
that
kind
of
state
involvement.
the
state
did
not
directly
create
the
district.
it
was
formed
by
private
individuals.
it
is
not
administered
by
publicly
elected
officials
or
their
designees.
it
has
not
become
assimilated
or
incorporated
into
the
state
or
local
government
so
as
to
become
one
of
its
constituent
parts.
the
county
judge
exercises
no
independent
judgment
in
appointing
the
districts
commissioners
except
in
the
remote
contingency
that
two
of
the
commissioners
may
not
be
able
to
agree
on
filling
a
vacancy.
the
tennessee
statute
requires
him
to
appoint
those
persons
nominated
in
the
petition
filed
by
the
local
property
owners.
utility
system
is
owned
by
the
district
itself
and
is
not
state
property.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
there
are
three
commissioners
your
honor
and
they
serve
--
the
--
those
who
are
first
appointed
following
the
volume
of
this
petition,
the
affirmation
by
the
county
court.
they
served
as
i
recall
for
a
staggered
period
of
two,
three
and
four
years.
thereafter,
any
successors
would
serve
for
a
period
of
four
years,
as
far
as
i
recall.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
sir,
i’m
sorry,
i
didn’t
hear
it.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
there
is
in
tennessee
an
ouster
statute.
and
under
this
ouster
statute,
the
ouster
statute
provides
that
where
an
official
of
a
municipality
or
political
subdivision
is
failing
to
perform
his
duties
that
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
or
the
city
attorney
or
the
county
attorney
as
the
case
maybe,
may
bring
ouster
proceedings
in
court,
whether
any
such
power
has
ever
been
exercised
with
the
respect
to
any
of
these
districts
and
we
are
told
that
there
are
approximately
270
of
them
in
the
state
of
tennessee,
i
don’t
know.
now,
the
utility
system
is
owned
by
the
district
itself
and
is
not
state
property.
it
has
no
authority
to
levy
taxes
and
must
meet
its
expenses
and
obligations
from
its
revenues.
the
district
is
completely
autonomous
in
the
conduct
of
its
affairs.
the
state
exercises
no
supervisory
power
over
the
conduct
of
the
district's
day
to
day
affairs
or
its
operations.
indeed,
the
tennessee
statute
expressly
bars
any
state
public
utility
commission
from
exercising
any
jurisdiction
over
the
management
and
control
of
the
system
or
its
rates
or
charges.
finally,
the
district
alone
exercises
the
power
to
hire
and
fire
employees.
the
state
does
not
control
either
directly
or
indirectly
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
for
the
district
and
apparently
on
the
basis
of
a
decision
by
a
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
the
state
of
tennessee.
apparently
these
employees
are
not
deemed
to
be
subject
to
the
state
restrictions
applicable
to
the
state
or
municipal
employees
with
the
respect
to
strikes
and
picketing.
essentially,
the
district
appears
to
be
--
the
board
found
that
essentially
it’s
a
private
venture
to
be
sure
for
the
benefit
of
the
community
and
for
the
benefit
of
the
community
but
nonetheless
a
private
venture
having
no
identity
or
relationship
to
the
state.
now
of
course,
as
the
state
of
tennessee
as
seen
fit
to
its
legislature
to
characterize,
to
label
this
district
here
as
a
political
subdivision
of
the
state
as
a
municipality.
but
that
factor
cannot
be
dispositive
of
the
status
of
this
district
here
for
purposes
of
the
federal
legislation.
as
this
court
said
some
years
ago,
the
labor
act
is
a
federal
legislation
administered
by
a
national
agency
to
solve
a
national
problem
on
a
national
scale.
and
the
general
principle
is
that
normally
that
congress
intends
that
it's
law
shall
have
uniform
application
so
that
its
programs
would
not
be
impaired.
now,
of
course,
a
state
has
an
important
interest
in
defining
its
political
subdivision
and
the
board
of
course
pays
considerable
attention
to
the
state's
legitimate
interest
in
defining
its
political
subdivisions.
but
that
interest
it
seems
to
us
must
be
weighed,
must
be
weighed
against
the
policies
of
the
statute
and
the
uniform
application
of
those
policies
which
this
court
had
repeatedly
confirmed
congress
intended.
now,
local
considerations,
local
problems
may
prompt
a
state,
may
prompt
a
state
to
characterize
as
a
political
subdivision,
what
is
essentially
a
private
venture.
having
no
real
identity
or
relationship
to
the
state
and
over
which
a
state
exercises
no
control.
if
state
by
state
characterizations
of
an
entity
as
a
political
subdivision
were
to
be
determinative
of
the
problem,
then
the
result
might
well
be
a
patchwork
of
policies,
a
patchwork
of
policies
and
exemptions
from
the
provisions
of
the
statute
which
have
no
relation
to
the
underlying
purpose
of
the
governmental
exemption
in
the
statute,
namely
the
avoidance
of
interference
and
the
employment
in
labor
relations
between
a
governmental
entity
and
its
employees.
i
don’t
believe
(inaudible)
say
that
in
this
particular
case
that
the
state
of
tennessee
has
seen
fit
to
label
a
district
as
a
political
subdivision
not
because
it
really
regards
as
an
armed
or
instrumentality
or
a
department
of
the
state
but
rather
because
it
sought
to
give
us
some
kind
of
tax
exemption
and
thereby
encourage
you,
encourage
local
citizens,
local
property
holders
here
to
create
these
districts.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
housing
authority?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
board
has
never
had
that
case
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
there
had
been
a
number
of
cases
which
are
cited
in
our
brief
and
the
principle
which
the
board
has
applied
to
these
cases,
to
these
cases
and
of
course
it
turns
upon
the
particular
facts
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
sir?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
but
that’s
a
political
subdivision.
it’s
a
political
subdivision,
i
don’t
think
anybody
would
quarrel,
that
the
city
is
a
political
subdivision
specifically
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
but,
i
would
still
regard
that
as
being
a
political
subdivision
of
the
state.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
of
course
that’s
one
of
the
elements
of
this
problem
here
is
whether
or
not
there
is
that
kind
of
control.
you
don’t
single
out
any
particular
single
fact
but
as
a
whole.
what
do
you
have
here?
do
you
have
that
kind
of
connection,
that
kind
of
relationship
to
the
state
here?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
but
the
statute
specifically
exempts
a
political
subdivision
of
a
state.
i
mean,
that’s
what
the
statute
says.
and
i
don’t
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
the
state
has
not
really
chosen
that
your
honor
because
here,
it’s
been
a
group
of
private
--
it’s
been
a
group
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
stands
on
more
relevant
--
have
a
statute
on
the
books
just
like
an
incorporation
statute
which
permits
private
individuals
to
set
up
a
private
corporation.
and
this
is
really
not
much
different
than
that.
how
to
be
sure?
to
be
sure
this
particular
district
has
been
given
certain
advantages,
to
be
given
the
advantages
and
no
tax
and
no
taxation.
and
again
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
oh,
yes.
the
board
has
exempted
that
very
kind
of
a
district.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well
the
board
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well
your
honor,
the
board
has
taken
the
position
in
defining
the
term
political
subdivisions
under
the
statute
so
as
to
exclude,
so
as
to
limit,
so
as
to
limit
a
political
subdivision,
that
kind
of
an
entity
which
is
either
been
directly
created
by
the
state
so
that
it
is
either
a
department
of
the
state
or
not
or
the
administrative
arm
of
the
state
or
those
entities
which
are
administered
by
individuals
who
are
either
directly
responsible
to
publicly
elected
officials
or
to
the
electorate
at
large,
the
general
electorate.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
new
post
office,
the
new
post
office
corporation
your
honor?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
but
that’s
been
specifically
brought
under
the
federal
--
under
the
labor
act.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
i
don’t
know
precisely
what
the
setup
of
the
new
post
office
is,
but
the
statute
also
excludes
wholly
owned
government
corporations
whether
the
new
post
office
is
a
wholly
owned
government
corporation
or
not
but
in
any
event,
congress
under
the
new
legislation
has
specifically
brought
a
new
post
office
system
under
the
the
labor
act.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
think
not,
that’s
right.
because
it’s
been
directly
created
by
the
state
and
it’s
an
armed
department
of
--
an
arm
or
an
instrumentality
of
the
state
itself.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
suppose
that
the
crux
of
the
matter
is
how
closely
are
the
public
officials
identified
with
the
running
of
employment
and
labor
relations
of
the
particular
entity?
that’s
a
very
important
factor
in
this
type
of
case.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
in
this
case
here?
they’re
not
public
officials
because
they
are
nominated
in
the
petition
that’s
filed
by
the
property
owners
and
the
state
court.
the
county
court
has
no
discretion
with
respect
to
designating
them
as
the
commissioners.
the
county
court
has
only
the
opportunity
to
name
one
of
the
commissioners,
only
in
the
event,
if
there’s
a
vacancy
and
the
two
commissioners
cannot
agree.
so
the
state
does
not
appoint
the
commissioners
other
than
just
simply
ratifying
here
the
nominees
that
have
been
made
by
the
local
property
holders
in
their
original
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
sir?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
i
think
i
don’t
want
to
answer
that
question
categorically
because
school
systems
may
differ
as
to
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
i
don’t
want
to
say
or
give
any
categorical
answer
because
i
don’t
know
just
how
they
operate.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no.
over
the
years,
i
think
the
board
has
had
at
least
those
which
have
come
--
are
now
incorporated
in
these
official
records.
there
have
been
in
the
neighborhood
of
a
dozen
or
so
cases.
but
the
problem
however
though
is
much
broader
than
that
because
in
this
particular
state
for
example,
in
tennessee,
we
are
told
that
there
are
270
of
these
particular
districts.
now,
what
the
situation
maybe
in
other
states,
there
maybe
differences
of
course.
in
some
cases,
perhaps
the
district
similar
to
this
one
here
maybe
regarded
by
the
board
itself
as
a
political
subdivision,
here
is
not.
so
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
there
is
one
case
your
honor
and
i
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
we
have
that
case
and
of
course
that
was
only
a
regional
director
who
made
that
decision.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
there
was
never
any
appeal
from
that
decision
to
the
board
itself.
the
board
has
expressly
overruled
that
decision
of
the
regional
director,
the
holding
rather,
the
holding
of
regional
director
in
that
particular
case.
so
that
particular
case
has
no
more
presidential
value,
if
i
may
use
somewhat
exaggerated
example
then
the
decision
of
a
district
court,
after
this
court
had
come
down
with
a
decision
under
the
same
type
of
issue.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
if
the
union
were
to
seek
representation
or
if
somebody
was
fired
there.
that
somebody
was
fired
there
because,
let’s
say
he
became
a
union
member
and
the
charges
were
filed
with
us
today
or
a
representation
of
petitioner
was
filed
today,
that
regional
director
would
entertain
those
--
either
the
representation
petition
or
the
unfair
labor
practice
charge
on
the
merits.
he
would
be
bound
by
the
board.
he’s
bound
by
the
board
decision
in
this
area
of
course.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
know
of
no
such
case.
no
such
instances.
i
know
of
none.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
i
think
i
was
being
asked
the
question
of
whether
they
were
public
officials
and
it’s
been
a
long
time
since
i
was
associated
with
the
school
and
it
may
vary
perhaps
how
these
people
are
appointed
to
run
the
school
system
of
a
particular
area.
that
was
the
reason
for
my
hesitation.
my
hesitation
if
school
officials
are
appointed
by
the
city
and
the
school
as
a
part
of
the
city,
obviously
the
board
would
not
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
that
the
board
has
never
had
any
such
case
and
i
would
be
surprised
if
we
ever
entertained
any
such
case
as
that.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
crux
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
crux
of
the
board’s
position
is
this.
that
it
limits
the
term
political
subdivisions
to
those
entities
that
are
either
directly
created
by
the
state
so
as
to
constitute
either
a
department
or
administrative
arm
of
the
state
or
those
entities
where
the
individuals
administering
that
particular
entity
are
either
responsible
directly
to
publicly
elected
officials
or
to
the
general
electorate.
that’s
the
distinction
that
the
board
has
drawn.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
if
they
are
not
within
those
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i’m
not
sure
that
i
understand
your
question
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that’s
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
they
just
simply
in
the
name
of
the
statute.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
i
think
that
it
certainly
was
an
important
element
in
the
board’s
thinking
here
that
underlies
the
classification,
that
either
the
interpretation
of
the
political
subdivision
here.
but
what
the
board
is
looking
to
is
to
what
extent,
to
what
extent
if
it’s
a
political
subdivision
of
a
state
that
we’re
concerned,
to
what
extent
is
the
state
administering
that
particular
entity?
to
what
extent
has
the
state
become
involved?
to
what
extent
has
the
state
become
involved
in
the
operation,
the
administration
of
that
particular
entity
and
particularly
its
labor
and
employment
relationships.
and
where
you
have
the
case
such
as
we
have
here
where
there’s
simply
an
enabling
statute
which
permits
private
citizens
to
create
this
kind
of
a
district
with
all
the
various
characteristics
that
i
have
described
there.
the
board
says
“well,
we
don’t
have
that
kind
of
involvement.”
we
don’t
have
that
kind
of
involvement
by
the
state
that
should
bring
in
to
play
the
congressional
purpose
and
to
bar
the
labor
board
from
intruding
into
the
employment
or
labor
relations
of
our
governmental
entity
and
its
employees.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
they
can
also
--
under
this
local
statute,
(voice

yes,
--
oh,
no,
the
board
doesn't
draw
a
distinction
between
gas
and
water
your
honor,
or
electricity.
it
depends
upon
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no
sir.
there
is
a
board
case
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
where
the
board
declined
to
assert
jurisdiction
over
a
gas
system
of
that
kind
that
your
honors
is
describing.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
it’s
not
so
much
a
question
of
distinguishing
between
what
kind
of
service,
what
is
water
or
gas
or
electricity
but
rather
it
goes
to
the
question,
what
is
the
entity
that
is
performing
that
service.
now,
in
the
case
that
i
referred
to
where
the
board
--
there,
the
gas
district
was
part
of
the
city,
of
the
city’s
operations,
it
was
run
by
a
board
of
the
utility
commissioners
i
recall
them
under
the
supervision
of
the
mayor.
and
the
city
had
financial
responsibility
for
the
operation
of
that
particular
gas
district
as
i
recall
it.
so
the
distinction
is
not
been
made
upon
whether
it's
water,
gas
or
electricity,
what
have
you,
but
what
is
the
nature
of
the
particular
corporation
or
entity
that
is
performing
this
kind
of
service
and
what
is
its
relationship?
what
is
relationship,
whatever
the
service
may
be,
water,
gas,
whatever,
what
is
its
relationship
to
the
state
government,
to
the
city
government
or
the
general
electorate
?thank
you.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
sir?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
record
is
silent
on
that
your
honor
and
all
that
i
have
--
all
--
there
is
no
state
law
as
far
as
i
know,
but
we
do
have
the
statement
of
the
manager
of
this
particular
district
here
who
testified,
that
neither
the
county
nor
the
state
has
any
control
all
over
the
labor
relations
of
this
particular
district.
