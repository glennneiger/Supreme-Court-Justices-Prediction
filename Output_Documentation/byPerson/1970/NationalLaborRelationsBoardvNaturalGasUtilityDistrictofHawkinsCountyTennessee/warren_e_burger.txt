mr.
manoli,
your
hesitation
in
answering
i
think
justice
white’s
question
about
school
boards
makes
me
put
this
question
to
you.
has
the
board
ever
asserted
jurisdiction
over
school
teachers
employed
by
the
state
or
a
city
or
municipality
or
any
public
school
teacher?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
have
assumed
that
was
the
case
but
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
i
wondered
why
you
hesitate.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
there
would
be
school
teachers,
fireman,
policeman,
at

those
three
categories?
chief

warren
e.
burger
municipal
employees
generally.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
was
a
little
confused
by
the
distinction
you
made
with
justice
white
about
--
here
you
have
a
gas
distribution
company
but
you
said
that
a
water
company
would
not
be
within
the
reach
of
the
board.
did
i
understand
that
correctly,
also
for
water?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i’m
speaking
of
the
board’s
policy.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
most
cities,
i
am
acquainted
with,
the
water
supply
is
controlled
by
the
municipality
and
municipal
employees,
do
you
reach
them?
chief

warren
e.

well,
in
the
nature
of
the
service,
how
do
you
distinguish
water
and
gas
or
electricity?

taxes?
chief

since
you
couldn’t
