mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
the
position
of
respondent
here
that
the
question
presented
is
not
whether
the
state
or
federal
determination
controls
whether
the
utility
district
is
a
political
subdivision
under
section
2.2
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
respondent
agrees
that
state
law
is
not
controlling
but
that
state
law
is
a
factor
along
with
all
the
other
factors
to
be
considered
in
reaching
this
determination.
it
is
respondent’s
position
further
that
there
was
no
conflict
between
the
hawkins
county
case
in
the
sixth
circuit
below
and
the
randolph
case
which
is
referred
to
by
the
board.
respondent
accepts
the
rule
in
the
randolph
case
which
is
to
the
extent
that
the
board
has
considered
the
economic
realities
and
the
statutory
purposes,
its
determination
is
entitled
to
great
respect.
it
is
simply
submitted
that
the
board
inadequately
and
improperly
considered
the
economic
realities
and
the
statutory
purposes
and
that
to
the
extent,
the
court
of
appeals
below
in
the
last
two
sentences
of
the
opinion
which
was
several
pages
long
stated
that
state
law
is
controlling.
respondent
explains
this
the
same
way
that
the
board
has
explained
one
of
its
decisions
in
its
brief
that
state
law
is
controlling.
the
board
has
held
state
law
to
be
controlling.
but
now
on
page
19
on
a
footnote
to
its
brief,
it
states
that
that
language
was
not
necessary
for
the
result
reached.
now
that
is
exactly
the
position
of
respondent
here.
because
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
for
several
pages
is
take
the
rule
in
the
randolph
case
and
apply
by
examining
the
economic
realities
one
at
a
time
and
deciding
that
the
board
had
inadequately
and
improperly
considered
that.
we
have
here
basically
a
jurisdictional
matter.
the
board
bestowed
jurisdiction
upon
itself
and
has
repeatedly
thereafter
refused
to
reconsider
this.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
it
is,
if
your
honor
please,
a
subdivision
of
the
state,
yes
sir.
it
is
created
--
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
they
are
public
officials,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes
sir,
they
would
take
an
oath
of
office.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
i’m
not
informed
on
that
your
honor
but
i
know
they
take
an
oath
before
they
serve.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
no
sir,
i
do
not
know
that.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes
sir,
you
can
be
a
state
official.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
state
officer.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
would
settle
for
that.
i
would
reply
your
honor
that
in
many
county
boards
which
this
is
analogous
to,
no
official
oath
of
office
is
taken
and
the
members
are
state
officials.
now,
whether
or
not
they
are
determined
to
be
state
officers,
i
don’t
know
the
exact
distinction
between
the
two.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
they
receive
very
nominal
compensation
your
honor.
they
get
$25.00
each
time
the
board
meets,
the
utility
board
meets.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
it
is
paid
by
the
county,
by
the
--
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
no,
it’s
paid
by
the
district
out
of
its
own
funds
your
honor.
we
consider
that
to
be
a
part
of
the
county
though.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
they
are
selected
every
two,
four
and
six
years.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
they
are
selected
originally
by
the
county
judge
and
i
would
like
to
state
--
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
vacancies
are
filled
by
the
members
of
the
board
unless
there
they
cannot
agree
and
then
they
are
filled
by
the
county
judge.
but
i
would
like
to
add
also
your
honor
that
in
certain
counties,
the
members
of
the
board
are
elected
in
general
elections.
now,
this
doesn’t
apply
in
hawkins
county.
but
we
submit
that
this
clearly
shows
the
political
nature
of
the
utility
district.
and
also,
the
county
judge
himself
is
a
constitutional
officer
and
is
the
highest
public
elected
official
in
a
county.
highest
administrative
official
on
the
county
and
is
the
same
to
a
county
as
the
governor
is
to
the
state
or
mayor
to
a
city.
and
that
frankly
if
we
have
had
a
mayor
make
these
appointments
rather
than
a
county
judge,
possibly
we
wouldn’t
be
here
today,
it’s
the
--
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes
sir.
he
is
an
executive
--
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes
sir.
he
is
the
top
administrative
official
elected
by
the
public
officials,
i
mean
by
the
voters
of
the
county.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
the
district
has
a
manager
and
the
manager
hires
and
fires
and
sets
the
wages.
but
we
might
add
that
this
is
the
logical
and
reasonable
and
expected
way
for
such
a
district
to
offer.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
no
sir,
we
do
not.
if
your
honors
please,
i
think
it’s
--
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes
sir.
they
are
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
a
late
board
decision
which
incidentally
involves
tennessee,
i’m
answering
your
honor’s
question.
coincidentally
involves
the
state
of
tennessee,
an
exemption
was
granted
to
the
fayetteville
lincoln
county
electric
system.
now
this
is
a
june
1970
board
decision.
and
in
that
case,
we
have
nearly
identical
facts
to
the
case
here.
we
have
enabling
legislation,
the
tennessee
municipal
electric
plant
law.
we
also
have
a
private
act
to
the
state
legislature
by
which
a
city
took
over
a
local
electric
company.
but
once
the
system
was
setup,
the
mayor
nominated
a
board
of
directors.
the
board
of
directors
then
had
a
manager.
the
manager
employed
all
the
employees.
now,
there
is
absolutely,
we
submit,
no
distinction
between
the
fayetteville
lincoln
county
system
which
was
--
the
exemption
was
granted
and
the
case
at
bar
with
the
one
exception
that
there,
the
mayor
appointed
the
board
of
public
utilities
and
here
the
county
judge
appointed
the
board
of
public
utilities.
and
we
submit
that
that
is
not
a
legitimate
basis
to
award
or
not
award
coverage
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
let
me
clarify
that
your
honor.
as
in
numerous
similar
entities,
for
instance
the
fayetteville
lincoln
county
system
that
i
just
referred
to,
individuals
are
nominated
to
the
county
judge
and
usually,
customarily,
he
appoints
the
nominees.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
the
original
person
seeking
to
setup
the
district.
they
nominate
property
owners
in
the
county.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
the
power
to
appoint
and
we
have
referred
to
some
municipal
law
in
mcquillin,
includes
the
power
not
to
appoint.
now,
we
are
not
faced
with
that
particular
problem
here
but
we
submit
that
if
the
county
judge
felt
that
a
nominee
was
incompetent
or
should
not
be
placed
in
this
position
that
he
would
not
have
to
make
this
appointment.
there’s
nothing
in
the
statute
that
says
that.
and
secondly,
as
we
said
of
course
that
in
certain
counties,
the
commissioners
are
elected
by
the
qualified
voters.
all
the
qualified
--
this
happens
to
be
a
smaller
county
and
don’t
operate
in
this
fashion.
now,
next
addressing
to
your
honors
question
about
vacancies.
vacancies
are
filled
by
the
remaining
commissioners
but
this
is
something
that
many
county
boards
have
this
administrative
procedure.
however,
if
they
cannot
agree,
it
is
specifically
provided
that
the
county
judge
will
fill
these
vacancies.
and
i
might
add
one
of
your
honors
asked
about
the
ouster
law.
the
ouster
law
of
tennessee
applies
specifically
to
public
elected
officials,
public
officials,
they
don’t
have
to
all
be
elected.
let’s
take
a
county
road
commissioner
who’s
guilty
of
dereliction
or
maltheisms
in
office,
an
action
would
be
brought
against
him
by
the
county
attorney.
there
would
be
jury
trial.
he
would
be
removed
or
not
removed
based
on
the
findings
of
the
jury.
this
ouster
statute
applicable
to
public
officials,
applies
to
utility
district
commissioners.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
your
honor
there
is
an
annotation
so
holding
and
we
have
referred
to
it
in
the
record,
in
our
brief
that
--
and
this
is
not
controverted
in
this
record.
i
might
add
one
other
thing
about
responsibility.
the
district
must
file
a
copy
of
its
annual
report
with
the
county
judge.
i
feel
that
--
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
no
sir.
they
are
all
kinds
of
districts
and
that
was
a
point
i
wanted
to
make.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
your
honor,
that
i
do
not
know
but
i
will
say
this
that
we
and
also
in
an
answer
to
the
chief
justice’s
remarks
earlier,
we
have
districts
in
tennessee
that
provide
fire
protection,
police
protection,
sewage,
natural
gas.
there
are
all
kinds
of
services
that
a
district
can
provide.
and
when
counsel
informed
the
court
that
there
are
270
districts.
right
there
are
but
they
provide
a
myriad
of
services
in
areas
where
usually
in
rural
areas
and
this
was
setup
by
the
legislature
with
that
in
mind
to
provide
governmental
services
where
there
was
no
other
entity
available
to
do
so.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
no
sir.
they
are
identical.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
were
both
natural
gas
districts.
the
benton,
caroll
county
district
is
a
natural
gas
district.
this
is
a
natural
gas
district.
but
a
district
can
perform
any
one
of
these
other
types
of
services,
and
often
performs
more
than
one
type
of
service.
it
can
have
fire
and
police
and
natural
gas
depending
on
what
is
needed
in
the
particular
area
involved.
i
think
--
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
where
the
commissioners
are
--
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes
sir,
whether
commissioners
are
elected
or
whether
the
county
judge
is
elected,
they
are
elected
by
the
qualified
voters
in
the
county
at
a
general
election.
yes
sir.
now,
i
feel
that
--
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
well
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
well,
the
board
simply
cannot
order
one
of
these
districts
to
bargain
with
a
labor
organization
if
we
prevail
and
if
the
board
prevails
a
district
would
have
to
bargain
with
the
labor
organization.
depending
---
i
suppose
depending
on
--
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
accordance
with
the
rule
of
law
that
we
contend
is
applicable
here.
we
would
like
to
bring
to
the
court’s
attention
several
undisputed
relevant
facts
in
this
record
that
have
not
been
mentioned
here
before.
some
of
which
we
submit
have
not
been
properly
understood
by
the
board.
first
place,
section
6-2615
tca,
the
same
utility
district
law
designates
a
utility
districts
records
as
“public
records.”
secondly,
as
referred
to
by
counsel,
a
utility
district
has
the
power
to
issue
subpoenas
for
witnesses
and
has
the
power
to
administer
oaths
to
witnesses.
now,
the
reference
was
made
by
the
board’s
counsel
to
that
section
of
the
act
6-2613
specifically
exempts
a
utility
district
from
regulation
by
the
tennessee
railroad
and
public
utilities
commission.
what
the
board
has
done
since
the
outset
of
this
litigation
does
not
understand
the
significance
of
that.
this
entity
is
exempt
privately
owned
public
utilities
and
railroads
are
regulated.
also,
under
several
federal
statutes,
acknowledgment
has
been
made
that
the
utility
district
is
a
municipality.
for
instance,
the
employees
of
the
district
are
covered
under
the
social
security
law
on
a
voluntary
rather
than
on
a
mandatory
basis
which
is
a
test
of
course
for
a
private
enterprise.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes
sir.
federal
social
security
has
been
so
acknowledged
by
the
responsible
federal
officials
in
the
district
as
so
operate.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes
sir.
the
code
section
allowing
voluntary
coverage
is
42
u.s.c.
418,
allowing
voluntary
coverage
for
municipal
employees.
and
a
district
is
operative
under
this
language
as
a
counterpart
section
in
the
tennessee
code
allowing
a
municipality
to
adopt
this.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
no
sir,
i
don’t
think
so.
i’m
not
positive
of
that
but
i
believe
it’s
only
for
municipalities.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
non-profit
--
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
i
do
not
know
sir
but
i
believe
you
are
probably
right
that
this
benefit
may
extend
to
non-profit
corporations
which
may
or
may
not
be
a
municipality.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
do
not
know
that
for
sure.
in
addition
to
this,
interest
on
utility
districts
bonds
is
tax
exempt
for
federal
income
tax
purposes
under
the
well-known
provision
exempting
income
on
tax
bringing
municipal
bonds.
a
district
is
required
to
publish
--
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
no
sir
we
do
not
but
we
have
made
this
contention
from
the
lowest
court
and
it
has
not
been
controverted
by
the
board.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
is
the
way
the
district
operates.
it
advertises
its
bonds
in
such
a
fashion
and
there
is
no
controversy
about
this
in
the
record.
but
as
far
as
the
special
ruling,
we
do
not
have
this.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
no
sir,
we
do
not,
it
has
not.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes
sir,
it
was.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
the
record
probably
can
make
have
this
in
it.
i
am
not
positive
about
this
but
as
a
matter
of
law,
we
have
made
this
contention
repeatedly
in
every
pleading
and
in
every
list
of
authorities
that
has
been
filed
and
its
never
been
controverted
by
the
board
that
when
its
bonds
are
advertised
for
public
sale,
they
are
advertised
as
tax
free
municipal
bonds.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
the
only
relevance
your
honor
is
that
this
is
one
more
of
a
series
of
indicia
showing
this
to
be
a
municipality.
in
other
words,
we
contend
that
in
all
of
the
board’s
decisions
granting
the
exemption
and
we’ll
refer
to
a
few
of
them.
there
is
no
case
that
has
more
factors
or
stronger
individual
factors
which
add
up
to
the
result
that
you
have
an
exempt
municipality
than
you
do
here.
that
--
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes
sir.
the
state
statute
calls
it
a
municipality.
repeatedly,
the
state
supreme
court
has
held
it
to
be
a
municipality.
the
board
has
taken
the
position
that
which
we
agree
with
that
state
law
is
not
controlling.
but
it
is
our
contention
and
our
strong
contention
that
state
law
is
definitely
a
factor
and
it
has
been
held
to
be
a
--
it
is
called
a
municipality
in
the
statute
in
so
many
words
in
several
places.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
we
get
tax
exemption.
it’s
not
subject
to
state
tax
at
all.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
feel
that
that
is
relevant.
it
is
also
exempt
from
the
state
railroad
and
public
utilities
commission
because
it
is
a
municipality.
all
of
these
standing
alone
--
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
federal
--
no
federal
income
tax
either
your
honor.
any
of
these
factors
standing
alone
may
not
--
they
must
be
considered
together
to
get
the
picture.
it’s
like
a
tapestry
and
we
contend
that
when
all
of
the
factors
are
added
up,
you
have
a
stronger
case
for
the
municipality
exemption
than
has
ever
been
allowed
by
the
board
in
its
other
decisions
and
that
the
only
real
difference
here
is
that
you
got
a
county
judge
rather
than
a
mayor
making
the
appointment.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
your
honor,
it’s
not
in
the
record
but
they
have
such
an
--
they
are
exempt
and
yes
they
do.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes
sir
but
it’s
not
applicable
to
this.
it’s
an
unearned
income
tax
--
no
sir,
we
do
have
a
corporation
income
tax
and
it’s
exempt
from
that.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
well,
it
also
exempt
specifically
from
all
state
taxation
your
honor
by
the
statute
itself.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
it’s
owned
by
the
citizens
of
the
district.
in
other
words
--
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
sir?
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes
sir.
it
has
an
exclusive
franchise
to
provide
the
service
that
it’s
setup
to
provide
to
all
inhabitants
of
the
district.
and
it
can
be
fire
protection,
police
protection
--
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
no
sir,
none.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
utility
district
commissioners
as
i
have
said
earlier
in
certain
counties
are
elected
by
the
general
electorate.
now,
in
reference
to
the
power
of
eminent
domain,
the
chief
justice
asked
originally
about
this
district
not
only
has
the
power
of
eminent
domain
but
has
it
against
other
governmental
entities.
we
certainly
as
a
stronger
form
of
the
power
of
eminent
domain
then
for
instance
a
telephone
company
might
have.
in
addition
to
these
factors
that
we
have
referred
to,
section
62612
of
the
utility
district
act
grants
to
the
district
all
the
powers
necessary
and
requisite
capable
of
being
delegated
by
the
legislature.
so,
we
contend
that
when
all
of
these
factors
are
added
up
and
the
totality
of
the
picture
is
before
this
court,
the
conclusion
must
follow
that
we
have
an
exempt
municipality.
i
would
like
in
addition
to
the
lafayette-lincoln
case
which
is
a
electric
system
under
the
tennessee
municipal
electric
plant
law
and
which
is
practically
identical
to
the
case
at
bar,
the
june
8,
1970
decision
by
the
board
granting
the
exemption.
we
also
have
another
late
board
case
granting
the
exemption
to
the
city
of
austell
natural
gas
system.
this
natural
gas
system
and
the
electric
system
were
both
granted
the
exemptions
as
being
municipalities.
the
difference
if
you
can
call
this
a
difference
is
that
in
these
cases
the
board
of
trustees
was
appointed
by
a
mayor,
rather
than
by
a
county
judge.
and
the
board's
standard
which
the
board
states
in
its
brief
is
controlling,
that
is
how
the
labor
relations
are
carried
on.
it
is
submitted
that
the
labor
relations
in
the
district
and
the
labor
relations
in
the
austell
natural
gas
case
and
lafayette-lincoln
electric
system
case
carry
on
exactly
the
same
way.
that
is
there
is
a
manager
who
hires
the
employees
and
that
as
far
as
the
commissioners
are
concerned,
they
more
or
less
direct
the
operations
of
the
gas
system
in
the
austell
case
or
the
gas
system
in
the
utility
district
of
hawkins
county
case.
so
we
submit
that
considering
these
two
cases,
we
can
find
no
distinction
between
them
and
the
case
that
is
before
us.
we
think
we
also
should
refer
to
the
board’s
standard
which
it
alleges
---
it
has
been
uniform
and
reasonable
in
its
application.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
no
sir,
i
don’t
believe
it
has.
if
there’s
such
a
case
in
tennessee,
i’m
unaware
of
it.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
they
have
the
right
to
sue
and
they
sue.
yes
sir,
but
as
far
as
--
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
they
do.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes
sir,
we
do.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes
sir.
that
law
has
been
changed
recently
and
according
to
my
recollection,
the
sovereign
is
now
required
to
carry
liability
insurance.
and
to
that
extent
can
be
sued.
but
there
has
been
no
such
suit
against
the
utility
district
of
which
i
am
aware
and
i
have
read
the
cases
on
utility
districts.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
contend
that
we
are
exempt
under
the
specific
language
of
the
act.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
no
sir,
it’s
statutory.
we
are
a
political
subdivision
to
the
state
of
tennessee
and
specifically
under
section
2
(2)
of
the
act,
a
state
or
a
political
subdivision
thereof
is
specifically
exempt.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
sir?
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
no
sir,
it
does
not.
it
has
three
commissioners
who
served
with
a
nominal
compensation
who
are
appointed
by
the
county
judge
and
is
much
the
same
as
a
county
utilities
board.
if
these
were
a
county
utilities
board
or
if
these
were
--
as
in
lafayette-lincoln
case,
a
board
of
trustees
to
run
the
electric
system,
we
say
it’s
exactly
the
same
except
that
there
are
so
many
more
factors
here
than
they
are
in
these
cases
where
the
board
has
granted
the
exemption.
i
would
like
to
have
just
a
moment
to
make
a
comment
on
the
board’s
alleged
reasonable
and
uniform
standard.
the
board’s
standard
is
actually
changed
between
1967
when
the
decision
and
direction
of
election
here
was
made
and
its
brief
today.
we
state
that
under
the
original
standard
of
the
board
and
under
the
revised
standard
that
this
district
is
administered
by
state
appointed
officials
if
we
go
by
the
board
standard.
the
board
standard
now
says
that
the
exemption
is
applicable
if
it’s
administered
by
persons
responsible
to
public
officials.
apparently
the
board
feels
that
we
may
be
able
to
persuade
the
court
that
the
utility
district
commissioners
are
state
appointed
that
is
appointed
by
a
county
judge.
but
that
they
would
be
held
not
to
be
responsible
to
the
publicly
--
we
say
they
are
responsible
to
the
publicly
elected
officials
too.
and
even
with
the
changed
standard
between
1967
and
the
brief
today,
the
utility
district
does
exempt.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
the
utility
district
commissioners
but
they
are
limited
by
statute.
your
honor
only
two
recover
enough,
to
cover
the
costs
of
operating
the
district.
they
cannot
operate
at
a
profit
and
if
they
get
a
surplus
funds
by
statute,
they
must
make
a
rebate
to
the
persons
who
enjoy
the
services
in
the
district.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes
sir.
this
is
by
a
statute
as
strictly
a
non-profit
entity.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
your
honor
that
is
theoretically
the
case.
this
particular
district
has
been
in
a
deficit
position
in
almost
from
the
beginning
but
they
have
increased
their
rates
with
the
hope
that
they
would
have
a
surplus
and
would
be
in
a
position
to
make
a
rebate.
they
had
to
borrow
funds
in
order
to
build,
to
extend
the
lines
out
into
the
rural
areas
which
is
their
purpose
for
being
and
they
have
not
have
a
surplus.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
sir?
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
the
deficits
have
remained
unpaid.
they
will
increase
their
rates
in
order
to
do
so.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
the
position
of
respondent
here
that
the
question
presented
is
not
whether
the
state
or
federal
determination
controls
whether
the
utility
district
is
a
political
subdivision
under
section
2.2
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
respondent
agrees
that
state
law
is
not
controlling
but
that
state
law
is
a
factor
along
with
all
the
other
factors
to
be
considered
in
reaching
this
determination.
it
is
respondent’s
position
further
that
there
was
no
conflict
between
the
hawkins
county
case
in
the
sixth
circuit
below
and
the
randolph
case
which
is
referred
to
by
the
board.
respondent
accepts
the
rule
in
the
randolph
case
which
is
to
the
extent
that
the
board
has
considered
the
economic
realities
and
the
statutory
purposes,
its
determination
is
entitled
to
great
respect.
it
is
simply
submitted
that
the
board
inadequately
and
improperly
considered
the
economic
realities
and
the
statutory
purposes
and
that
to
the
extent,
the
court
of
appeals
below
in
the
last
two
sentences
of
the
opinion
which
was
several
pages
long
stated
that
state
law
is
controlling.
respondent
explains
this
the
same
way
that
the
board
has
explained
one
of
its
decisions
in
its
brief
that
state
law
is
controlling.
the
board
has
held
state
law
to
be
controlling.
but
now
on
page
19
on
a
footnote
to
its
brief,
it
states
that
that
language
was
not
necessary
for
the
result
reached.
now
that
is
exactly
the
position
of
respondent
here.
because
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
for
several
pages
is
take
the
rule
in
the
randolph
case
and
apply
by
examining
the
economic
realities
one
at
a
time
and
deciding
that
the
board
had
inadequately
and
improperly
considered
that.
we
have
here
basically
a
jurisdictional
matter.
the
board
bestowed
jurisdiction
upon
itself
and
has
repeatedly
thereafter
refused
to
reconsider
this.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
it
is,
if
your
honor
please,
a
subdivision
of
the
state,
yes
sir.
it
is
created
--
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
they
are
public
officials,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes
sir,
they
would
take
an
oath
of
office.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
i’m
not
informed
on
that
your
honor
but
i
know
they
take
an
oath
before
they
serve.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
no
sir,
i
do
not
know
that.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes
sir,
you
can
be
a
state
official.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
state
officer.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
would
settle
for
that.
i
would
reply
your
honor
that
in
many
county
boards
which
this
is
analogous
to,
no
official
oath
of
office
is
taken
and
the
members
are
state
officials.
now,
whether
or
not
they
are
determined
to
be
state
officers,
i
don’t
know
the
exact
distinction
between
the
two.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
they
receive
very
nominal
compensation
your
honor.
they
get
$25.00
each
time
the
board
meets,
the
utility
board
meets.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
it
is
paid
by
the
county,
by
the
--
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
no,
it’s
paid
by
the
district
out
of
its
own
funds
your
honor.
we
consider
that
to
be
a
part
of
the
county
though.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
they
are
selected
every
two,
four
and
six
years.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
they
are
selected
originally
by
the
county
judge
and
i
would
like
to
state
--
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
vacancies
are
filled
by
the
members
of
the
board
unless
there
they
cannot
agree
and
then
they
are
filled
by
the
county
judge.
but
i
would
like
to
add
also
your
honor
that
in
certain
counties,
the
members
of
the
board
are
elected
in
general
elections.
now,
this
doesn’t
apply
in
hawkins
county.
but
we
submit
that
this
clearly
shows
the
political
nature
of
the
utility
district.
and
also,
the
county
judge
himself
is
a
constitutional
officer
and
is
the
highest
public
elected
official
in
a
county.
highest
administrative
official
on
the
county
and
is
the
same
to
a
county
as
the
governor
is
to
the
state
or
mayor
to
a
city.
and
that
frankly
if
we
have
had
a
mayor
make
these
appointments
rather
than
a
county
judge,
possibly
we
wouldn’t
be
here
today,
it’s
the
--
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes
sir.
he
is
an
executive
--
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes
sir.
he
is
the
top
administrative
official
elected
by
the
public
officials,
i
mean
by
the
voters
of
the
county.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
the
district
has
a
manager
and
the
manager
hires
and
fires
and
sets
the
wages.
but
we
might
add
that
this
is
the
logical
and
reasonable
and
expected
way
for
such
a
district
to
offer.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
no
sir,
we
do
not.
if
your
honors
please,
i
think
it’s
--
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes
sir.
they
are
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
a
late
board
decision
which
incidentally
involves
tennessee,
i’m
answering
your
honor’s
question.
coincidentally
involves
the
state
of
tennessee,
an
exemption
was
granted
to
the
fayetteville
lincoln
county
electric
system.
now
this
is
a
june
1970
board
decision.
and
in
that
case,
we
have
nearly
identical
facts
to
the
case
here.
we
have
enabling
legislation,
the
tennessee
municipal
electric
plant
law.
we
also
have
a
private
act
to
the
state
legislature
by
which
a
city
took
over
a
local
electric
company.
but
once
the
system
was
setup,
the
mayor
nominated
a
board
of
directors.
the
board
of
directors
then
had
a
manager.
the
manager
employed
all
the
employees.
now,
there
is
absolutely,
we
submit,
no
distinction
between
the
fayetteville
lincoln
county
system
which
was
--
the
exemption
was
granted
and
the
case
at
bar
with
the
one
exception
that
there,
the
mayor
appointed
the
board
of
public
utilities
and
here
the
county
judge
appointed
the
board
of
public
utilities.
and
we
submit
that
that
is
not
a
legitimate
basis
to
award
or
not
award
coverage
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
let
me
clarify
that
your
honor.
as
in
numerous
similar
entities,
for
instance
the
fayetteville
lincoln
county
system
that
i
just
referred
to,
individuals
are
nominated
to
the
county
judge
and
usually,
customarily,
he
appoints
the
nominees.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
the
original
person
seeking
to
setup
the
district.
they
nominate
property
owners
in
the
county.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
the
power
to
appoint
and
we
have
referred
to
some
municipal
law
in
mcquillin,
includes
the
power
not
to
appoint.
now,
we
are
not
faced
with
that
particular
problem
here
but
we
submit
that
if
the
county
judge
felt
that
a
nominee
was
incompetent
or
should
not
be
placed
in
this
position
that
he
would
not
have
to
make
this
appointment.
there’s
nothing
in
the
statute
that
says
that.
and
secondly,
as
we
said
of
course
that
in
certain
counties,
the
commissioners
are
elected
by
the
qualified
voters.
all
the
qualified
--
this
happens
to
be
a
smaller
county
and
don’t
operate
in
this
fashion.
now,
next
addressing
to
your
honors
question
about
vacancies.
vacancies
are
filled
by
the
remaining
commissioners
but
this
is
something
that
many
county
boards
have
this
administrative
procedure.
however,
if
they
cannot
agree,
it
is
specifically
provided
that
the
county
judge
will
fill
these
vacancies.
and
i
might
add
one
of
your
honors
asked
about
the
ouster
law.
the
ouster
law
of
tennessee
applies
specifically
to
public
elected
officials,
public
officials,
they
don’t
have
to
all
be
elected.
let’s
take
a
county
road
commissioner
who’s
guilty
of
dereliction
or
maltheisms
in
office,
an
action
would
be
brought
against
him
by
the
county
attorney.
there
would
be
jury
trial.
he
would
be
removed
or
not
removed
based
on
the
findings
of
the
jury.
this
ouster
statute
applicable
to
public
officials,
applies
to
utility
district
commissioners.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
your
honor
there
is
an
annotation
so
holding
and
we
have
referred
to
it
in
the
record,
in
our
brief
that
--
and
this
is
not
controverted
in
this
record.
i
might
add
one
other
thing
about
responsibility.
the
district
must
file
a
copy
of
its
annual
report
with
the
county
judge.
i
feel
that
--
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
no
sir.
they
are
all
kinds
of
districts
and
that
was
a
point
i
wanted
to
make.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
your
honor,
that
i
do
not
know
but
i
will
say
this
that
we
and
also
in
an
answer
to
the
chief
justice’s
remarks
earlier,
we
have
districts
in
tennessee
that
provide
fire
protection,
police
protection,
sewage,
natural
gas.
there
are
all
kinds
of
services
that
a
district
can
provide.
and
when
counsel
informed
the
court
that
there
are
270
districts.
right
there
are
but
they
provide
a
myriad
of
services
in
areas
where
usually
in
rural
areas
and
this
was
setup
by
the
legislature
with
that
in
mind
to
provide
governmental
services
where
there
was
no
other
entity
available
to
do
so.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
no
sir.
they
are
identical.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
were
both
natural
gas
districts.
the
benton,
caroll
county
district
is
a
natural
gas
district.
this
is
a
natural
gas
district.
but
a
district
can
perform
any
one
of
these
other
types
of
services,
and
often
performs
more
than
one
type
of
service.
it
can
have
fire
and
police
and
natural
gas
depending
on
what
is
needed
in
the
particular
area
involved.
i
think
--
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
where
the
commissioners
are
--
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes
sir,
whether
commissioners
are
elected
or
whether
the
county
judge
is
elected,
they
are
elected
by
the
qualified
voters
in
the
county
at
a
general
election.
yes
sir.
now,
i
feel
that
--
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
well
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
well,
the
board
simply
cannot
order
one
of
these
districts
to
bargain
with
a
labor
organization
if
we
prevail
and
if
the
board
prevails
a
district
would
have
to
bargain
with
the
labor
organization.
depending
---
i
suppose
depending
on
--
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
accordance
with
the
rule
of
law
that
we
contend
is
applicable
here.
we
would
like
to
bring
to
the
court’s
attention
several
undisputed
relevant
facts
in
this
record
that
have
not
been
mentioned
here
before.
some
of
which
we
submit
have
not
been
properly
understood
by
the
board.
first
place,
section
6-2615
tca,
the
same
utility
district
law
designates
a
utility
districts
records
as
“public
records.”
secondly,
as
referred
to
by
counsel,
a
utility
district
has
the
power
to
issue
subpoenas
for
witnesses
and
has
the
power
to
administer
oaths
to
witnesses.
now,
the
reference
was
made
by
the
board’s
counsel
to
that
section
of
the
act
6-2613
specifically
exempts
a
utility
district
from
regulation
by
the
tennessee
railroad
and
public
utilities
commission.
what
the
board
has
done
since
the
outset
of
this
litigation
does
not
understand
the
significance
of
that.
this
entity
is
exempt
privately
owned
public
utilities
and
railroads
are
regulated.
also,
under
several
federal
statutes,
acknowledgment
has
been
made
that
the
utility
district
is
a
municipality.
for
instance,
the
employees
of
the
district
are
covered
under
the
social
security
law
on
a
voluntary
rather
than
on
a
mandatory
basis
which
is
a
test
of
course
for
a
private
enterprise.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes
sir.
federal
social
security
has
been
so
acknowledged
by
the
responsible
federal
officials
in
the
district
as
so
operate.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes
sir.
the
code
section
allowing
voluntary
coverage
is
42
u.s.c.
418,
allowing
voluntary
coverage
for
municipal
employees.
and
a
district
is
operative
under
this
language
as
a
counterpart
section
in
the
tennessee
code
allowing
a
municipality
to
adopt
this.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
no
sir,
i
don’t
think
so.
i’m
not
positive
of
that
but
i
believe
it’s
only
for
municipalities.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
non-profit
--
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
i
do
not
know
sir
but
i
believe
you
are
probably
right
that
this
benefit
may
extend
to
non-profit
corporations
which
may
or
may
not
be
a
municipality.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
do
not
know
that
for
sure.
in
addition
to
this,
interest
on
utility
districts
bonds
is
tax
exempt
for
federal
income
tax
purposes
under
the
well-known
provision
exempting
income
on
tax
bringing
municipal
bonds.
a
district
is
required
to
publish
--
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
no
sir
we
do
not
but
we
have
made
this
contention
from
the
lowest
court
and
it
has
not
been
controverted
by
the
board.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
is
the
way
the
district
operates.
it
advertises
its
bonds
in
such
a
fashion
and
there
is
no
controversy
about
this
in
the
record.
but
as
far
as
the
special
ruling,
we
do
not
have
this.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
no
sir,
we
do
not,
it
has
not.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes
sir,
it
was.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
the
record
probably
can
make
have
this
in
it.
i
am
not
positive
about
this
but
as
a
matter
of
law,
we
have
made
this
contention
repeatedly
in
every
pleading
and
in
every
list
of
authorities
that
has
been
filed
and
its
never
been
controverted
by
the
board
that
when
its
bonds
are
advertised
for
public
sale,
they
are
advertised
as
tax
free
municipal
bonds.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
the
only
relevance
your
honor
is
that
this
is
one
more
of
a
series
of
indicia
showing
this
to
be
a
municipality.
in
other
words,
we
contend
that
in
all
of
the
board’s
decisions
granting
the
exemption
and
we’ll
refer
to
a
few
of
them.
there
is
no
case
that
has
more
factors
or
stronger
individual
factors
which
add
up
to
the
result
that
you
have
an
exempt
municipality
than
you
do
here.
that
--
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes
sir.
the
state
statute
calls
it
a
municipality.
repeatedly,
the
state
supreme
court
has
held
it
to
be
a
municipality.
the
board
has
taken
the
position
that
which
we
agree
with
that
state
law
is
not
controlling.
but
it
is
our
contention
and
our
strong
contention
that
state
law
is
definitely
a
factor
and
it
has
been
held
to
be
a
--
it
is
called
a
municipality
in
the
statute
in
so
many
words
in
several
places.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
we
get
tax
exemption.
it’s
not
subject
to
state
tax
at
all.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
feel
that
that
is
relevant.
it
is
also
exempt
from
the
state
railroad
and
public
utilities
commission
because
it
is
a
municipality.
all
of
these
standing
alone
--
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
federal
--
no
federal
income
tax
either
your
honor.
any
of
these
factors
standing
alone
may
not
--
they
must
be
considered
together
to
get
the
picture.
it’s
like
a
tapestry
and
we
contend
that
when
all
of
the
factors
are
added
up,
you
have
a
stronger
case
for
the
municipality
exemption
than
has
ever
been
allowed
by
the
board
in
its
other
decisions
and
that
the
only
real
difference
here
is
that
you
got
a
county
judge
rather
than
a
mayor
making
the
appointment.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
your
honor,
it’s
not
in
the
record
but
they
have
such
an
--
they
are
exempt
and
yes
they
do.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes
sir
but
it’s
not
applicable
to
this.
it’s
an
unearned
income
tax
--
no
sir,
we
do
have
a
corporation
income
tax
and
it’s
exempt
from
that.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
well,
it
also
exempt
specifically
from
all
state
taxation
your
honor
by
the
statute
itself.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
it’s
owned
by
the
citizens
of
the
district.
in
other
words
--
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
sir?
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes
sir.
it
has
an
exclusive
franchise
to
provide
the
service
that
it’s
setup
to
provide
to
all
inhabitants
of
the
district.
and
it
can
be
fire
protection,
police
protection
--
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
no
sir,
none.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
utility
district
commissioners
as
i
have
said
earlier
in
certain
counties
are
elected
by
the
general
electorate.
now,
in
reference
to
the
power
of
eminent
domain,
the
chief
justice
asked
originally
about
this
district
not
only
has
the
power
of
eminent
domain
but
has
it
against
other
governmental
entities.
we
certainly
as
a
stronger
form
of
the
power
of
eminent
domain
then
for
instance
a
telephone
company
might
have.
in
addition
to
these
factors
that
we
have
referred
to,
section
62612
of
the
utility
district
act
grants
to
the
district
all
the
powers
necessary
and
requisite
capable
of
being
delegated
by
the
legislature.
so,
we
contend
that
when
all
of
these
factors
are
added
up
and
the
totality
of
the
picture
is
before
this
court,
the
conclusion
must
follow
that
we
have
an
exempt
municipality.
i
would
like
in
addition
to
the
lafayette-lincoln
case
which
is
a
electric
system
under
the
tennessee
municipal
electric
plant
law
and
which
is
practically
identical
to
the
case
at
bar,
the
june
8,
1970
decision
by
the
board
granting
the
exemption.
we
also
have
another
late
board
case
granting
the
exemption
to
the
city
of
austell
natural
gas
system.
this
natural
gas
system
and
the
electric
system
were
both
granted
the
exemptions
as
being
municipalities.
the
difference
if
you
can
call
this
a
difference
is
that
in
these
cases
the
board
of
trustees
was
appointed
by
a
mayor,
rather
than
by
a
county
judge.
and
the
board's
standard
which
the
board
states
in
its
brief
is
controlling,
that
is
how
the
labor
relations
are
carried
on.
it
is
submitted
that
the
labor
relations
in
the
district
and
the
labor
relations
in
the
austell
natural
gas
case
and
lafayette-lincoln
electric
system
case
carry
on
exactly
the
same
way.
that
is
there
is
a
manager
who
hires
the
employees
and
that
as
far
as
the
commissioners
are
concerned,
they
more
or
less
direct
the
operations
of
the
gas
system
in
the
austell
case
or
the
gas
system
in
the
utility
district
of
hawkins
county
case.
so
we
submit
that
considering
these
two
cases,
we
can
find
no
distinction
between
them
and
the
case
that
is
before
us.
we
think
we
also
should
refer
to
the
board’s
standard
which
it
alleges
---
it
has
been
uniform
and
reasonable
in
its
application.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
no
sir,
i
don’t
believe
it
has.
if
there’s
such
a
case
in
tennessee,
i’m
unaware
of
it.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
they
have
the
right
to
sue
and
they
sue.
yes
sir,
but
as
far
as
--
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
they
do.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes
sir,
we
do.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes
sir.
that
law
has
been
changed
recently
and
according
to
my
recollection,
the
sovereign
is
now
required
to
carry
liability
insurance.
and
to
that
extent
can
be
sued.
but
there
has
been
no
such
suit
against
the
utility
district
of
which
i
am
aware
and
i
have
read
the
cases
on
utility
districts.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
contend
that
we
are
exempt
under
the
specific
language
of
the
act.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
no
sir,
it’s
statutory.
we
are
a
political
subdivision
to
the
state
of
tennessee
and
specifically
under
section
2
(2)
of
the
act,
a
state
or
a
political
subdivision
thereof
is
specifically
exempt.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
sir?
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
no
sir,
it
does
not.
it
has
three
commissioners
who
served
with
a
nominal
compensation
who
are
appointed
by
the
county
judge
and
is
much
the
same
as
a
county
utilities
board.
if
these
were
a
county
utilities
board
or
if
these
were
--
as
in
lafayette-lincoln
case,
a
board
of
trustees
to
run
the
electric
system,
we
say
it’s
exactly
the
same
except
that
there
are
so
many
more
factors
here
than
they
are
in
these
cases
where
the
board
has
granted
the
exemption.
i
would
like
to
have
just
a
moment
to
make
a
comment
on
the
board’s
alleged
reasonable
and
uniform
standard.
the
board’s
standard
is
actually
changed
between
1967
when
the
decision
and
direction
of
election
here
was
made
and
its
brief
today.
we
state
that
under
the
original
standard
of
the
board
and
under
the
revised
standard
that
this
district
is
administered
by
state
appointed
officials
if
we
go
by
the
board
standard.
the
board
standard
now
says
that
the
exemption
is
applicable
if
it’s
administered
by
persons
responsible
to
public
officials.
apparently
the
board
feels
that
we
may
be
able
to
persuade
the
court
that
the
utility
district
commissioners
are
state
appointed
that
is
appointed
by
a
county
judge.
but
that
they
would
be
held
not
to
be
responsible
to
the
publicly
--
we
say
they
are
responsible
to
the
publicly
elected
officials
too.
and
even
with
the
changed
standard
between
1967
and
the
brief
today,
the
utility
district
does
exempt.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
the
utility
district
commissioners
but
they
are
limited
by
statute.
your
honor
only
two
recover
enough,
to
cover
the
costs
of
operating
the
district.
they
cannot
operate
at
a
profit
and
if
they
get
a
surplus
funds
by
statute,
they
must
make
a
rebate
to
the
persons
who
enjoy
the
services
in
the
district.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
yes
sir.
this
is
by
a
statute
as
strictly
a
non-profit
entity.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
your
honor
that
is
theoretically
the
case.
this
particular
district
has
been
in
a
deficit
position
in
almost
from
the
beginning
but
they
have
increased
their
rates
with
the
hope
that
they
would
have
a
surplus
and
would
be
in
a
position
to
make
a
rebate.
they
had
to
borrow
funds
in
order
to
build,
to
extend
the
lines
out
into
the
rural
areas
which
is
their
purpose
for
being
and
they
have
not
have
a
surplus.
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
sir?
mr.
eugene
greener,
jr.
the
deficits
have
remained
unpaid.
they
will
increase
their
rates
in
order
to
do
so.
thank
you
sir.
