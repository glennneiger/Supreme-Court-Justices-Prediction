mr.
leverett
what
do
you
say
what's
the
response
of
the
school
board?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
much
should
they
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you
know
that
as
of
1969
which
the
law
appeared,
how
far
could
you
--
what
was
the
one
or
more
things
the
school
board
did
that
you
think
are
wrong?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
prohibits
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
there
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
prohibits
to
enjoin
gerrymandering
the
lines?
justice
thurgood
marshall
gerrymandering
was
in
the
brown
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
no
zoning
there,
its
just
two
students,
is
that
so?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
even
though
they
have
it,
all
the
court
has
to
do
is
to
say
you
can
no
longer
have
segregated
school
system?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
in
this
we’re
going
to
have
to
look
beyond
green
case.
i
want
to
find
it
any
further.
well
under
green
case
you
got
to
do
something.
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
the
only
way
you
can
break
up
the
segregating
system
is
to
gerrymander,
you
say
you
can’t
do
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
personally
was
assuming
what
we
said
in
green
that
you’ve
got
to
break
up
this
system?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
about
considering
the
race,
is
there
any
way
under
the
sun
you
can
breakup
a
segregated
system
without
considering
race?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
as
to
the
race?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
then
you
consider
race
in
every
play
you
think
of,
you
still
have
all
black
and
all
white
schools,
don’t
you
agree
you
have
to
go
a
little
further?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
you
--
the
school
system
has
negro
high
school
or
the
frederick
douglas
negro
high
school,
i
assume
your
position
is
that
you
just
take
a
word
negro
off
and
that
did
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
more
do
you
have
to
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
which
--
what
other
argument
is
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
i
mean
what
other
premature’s
plan
is
good?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
i
simply
to
say,
there
is
a
premature’s
plan
that’s
a
good
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
would
you
have
legitimate
freedom
of
choice?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
do
you
conceive
that
in
a
school
system
that
has
been
segregated
since
its
existence,
you
could
have
actual
freedom
of
choice.
do
you
actually
believe
that’s
possible?
