justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
board
here
decided
to
do
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
weren't
under
an
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
[laughter]
--
so,
does
this
case
pose
the
question
i
asked
the
counsel
who
just
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
in
terms
of
the
power
of
the
board
on
its
own
to
do
something?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
hew
makes
it
pursuant
to
its
statutory
authority
and
that
statute
have
to
be
valid,
and
you
just
--
you
really
changed
the
question
whether
the
school
boards
can
do
it,
as
to
whether
congress
can
do
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
and
you
say
that
no
governmental
authority
may
decide
that
for
educational
reasons,
we
want
educate
blacks
and
whites
together
and
therefore
we
will
not
send
them
to
the
same
neighborhood
schools
that
we
used
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
yes
i
think
it
is.
we
do,
if
you
say
that
the
board
acted,
your
answer
is
that
the
board
acted
in
--
under
compulsion
of
hew?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
let's
concede
for
the
moment
that
your
board
did
act
under
compulsion
of
hew.
let’s
assume
that
an
hew
action
is
valid,
action
under
the
statute
that
was
operating
in.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
no
because
that
you
would
say
the
statute
is
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
say
that
statute
is
unconstitutional.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
no.
no,
i
think
we
just
--
we
have
just
--
so
i
think
the
constitutional
question
is
posed
about
--
by
this
case
whether
or
not
a
legislative
by
the
may
on
its
own
decide
that
education
of
the
races
together
is
better
than
apart?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
insulates
in
your
mind
in
order
of
the
school
board
to
a
faculty
member
to
go
to
a
certain
school
and
teach
there
because
he
is
a
black
teacher
or
he
is
a
white
teacher?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
mean
why
is
that
consistent
with
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
say
the
same
rule
applies
to
faculties
to
the
students?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
don’t
concede
anything
about
the
faculty?
justice
byron
r.
white
may
i
ask
you,
you
said
a
while
ago
that
the
board
has
planned
this
case
with
the
(inaudible)
proffered
by
hew?
justice
byron
r.
white
since
you
got
all
that
all
beginning
question
of
hew’s
conduct,
was
that
conduct
understandable?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it
--
let
me
rephrase
my
question.
if
you
challenge
the
authority
of
hew
under
statutes
that
governs
this
conduct
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
the
--
and
i
suppose
you
would
say
that
if
its
conduct
was
authorized
by
the
statute,
is
that
true?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
board
here
decided
to
do
it?
justice
byron

white
but
you
weren't
