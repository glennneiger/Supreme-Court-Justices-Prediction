whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
agree
with
the
solicitor
general’s
view
if
i
understand
his
view
correctly,
the
school
board
has
broader
powers
in
working
out
this
remedies
than
a
district
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
your
answer
would
be,
generally
you
join
in
that
view?
chief

burger
--
expressed
by
the
solicitor?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
epting.
mr.
leverett.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you’d
help
me
mr.
leverett,
if
you
would
just
list
one,
two,
three
that’s
how
many
they
are,
the
things
which
must
be
done
now
complying
with
the
desegregation
mandate
which
were
not
required
to
be
done
prior
to
series
of
holdings
of
this
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
what
are
the
specifics
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
second
one
then
is
a
bona
fide
freedom
of
choice
which
would
be
implemented
in
good
faith,
don’t
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
alright.
now,
what’s
the
third?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
would
mean
till
you
give
much
help
in
terms
of
long
distances,
would
it,
if
you
left
it
to
pure
chance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
perhaps
might
be
worst
than
the
old,
don’t
you
think?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
while
we’re
there,
would
you
say
that
the
powers
of
the
court,
this
court,
and
the
powers
of
congress
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
are
mutually
exclusive?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
under
the
one
section
i’m
talking
about,
just
under
the
enforcement
clause,
that
is
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
it
falls
under
the
enforcement
clause
that
only
congress
may
implement
it
with
actual
and
not
the
courts,
is
that
your
argument?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
the
court
have
framed
the
remedies
which
were
articulated
in
1983
and
the
related
sections,
independent
of
congress?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
see
if
i
follow.
you
are
suggesting
a
school
board
could
solve
this
problem
constitutionally.
satisfy
all
our
demands,
if
it
had
zones
and
paring
of
schools
etcetera,
the
same
types
of
things
that
have
been
done
in
all
of
these
cases,
but
provided
that
any
pupil
objecting
would
have
the
freedom
of
choice
to
go
where
he
wanted
to
go,
is
that
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
wouldn’t
it
be
permitted,
couldn’t
they
take
advantage
of
an
assignment
even
if
it
was
done
on
race.
if
they
liked
it
and
wanted
it
and
didn’t
object
to
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
wasn’t
proposing
that
as
a
remedy.
i
was
proposing
that
i
understood
your
proposition
to
encompass
that
as
a
permissible
remedy.
but
you
say
that
if
in
the
first
instance,
race
was
taken
in
to
account
in
the
zoning
or
the
pairing
its
void
right
from
the
beginning?
