mr.
eugene
a.
epting
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
the
court
will
find
that
this
case
is
somewhat
unique.
i
would
venture
to
say
that
in
most,
if
not
all,
of
the
cases
before
this
court
involving
boards
of
education,
the
board
has
been
here
either
complaining
that
it
should
not
be
required
to
do
what
its
been
told
and
asked
to
do
or
defending
itself,
in
claiming
that
it
has
done
all
that
it's
required
to
do.
here
you
have
the
board
of
education
defending
itself
against
the
charge
that
it’s
doing
too
much.
in
other
words,
clarke
county
board
of
education
has
tried
to
avoid
the
entanglement
of
federal
court
decisions
in
regard
to
the
question
of
desegregation.
so
far
it
has
succeeded
and
when
i
hear
and
read
the
arguments
in
regard
to
the
tribulations
of
charlotte
and
mobil
and
clarksdale,
bessemer,
jefferson,
i
think
they
have
acted
wisely
on
that
score.
but,
we
have
come
to
the
proposition
where
having
avoided
entanglement
and
federal
court
authors
running
our
of
schools,
we
find
ourselves
faced
with
as
a
state
court
injunction
that
says,
we
can’t
do
what
we
have
done,
because
in
undertaking
to
honor
the
fourteenth
amendment
rights
of
some
people,
we
are
thereby
violating
the
fourteenth
amendment
rights
of
others.
now,
i
would
agree
with
the
tenner
of
the
arguments
in
charlotte
that
all
of
these
busing
of
students
from
one
community
to
another
is
not
in
the
best
interest
of
the
education
is
that
--
if
i
understand
one
of
their
points
correctly,
but
in
the
clarke
county
case,
we
are
not
dealing
where
the
court
ordered
busing.
we
are
dealing
with
what
has
been
called
pocket
busing
to
a
limited
extent.
we
are
small
school
district.
we
have
only
11,000
students.
we
have
only
15
elementary
students.
we
call
it
pocket
busing,
in
charlotte
they
called
it
“satellite
zoning,”
but
it
means
the
same
thing.
in
undertaking
to
pocket
bus
and
if
the
court
wishes
to
look
at
the
record,
i
think
you
will
see
a
map
on
page
174
that
shows
the
geographical
locations
of
these
pockets
of
students
who
were
bused
to
schools
which
were
formally,
predominantly
of
the
other
race.
if
you
will
look
at
page
167,
you
will
see
the
chart
of
a
neighborhood
plan
which
was
best
adopted
by
this
court,
and
which
shows
the
extent,
the
chart
on
the
map
shows
the
extent
of
racial
mixing.
when
we
talk
about
desegregation
and
racial
balance
and
integration,
when
we
get
it
all
down
to
a
common
denominator,
we
are
talking
about
mixing
the
races
in
the
school,
that’s
what
it
amounts
to
in
plain
simple
language.
mr.
eugene
a.
epting
the
board
here
decided
to
--
well,
let's
put
it
this
way.
the
board
felt
that
under
the
judge
--
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
particularly
the
decisions
of
the
fifth
circuit
court,
we
were
compelled
to
do
it.
mr.
eugene
a.
epting
we
were
not
under
an
order
and
we
didn’t
want
to
get
under
an
order.
mr.
eugene
a.
epting
it’s
strikingly
similar
except
they’re
talking
about
a
statutory
--
mr.
eugene
a.
epting
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
now,
it
is
our
position
that
when
this
court
decided
brown
ii,
this
court
said
that
there
was
a
duty
on
the
boards
of
education
to
do
something
more
than
back
off
from
state
order
of
discrimination.
brown
i
had
already
said
that
and
if
that
was
all
we
required
to
do
is
stop
segregating
by
law
then
we
didn’t
need
brown
ii
and
we
didn’t
need
copper
versus
aaron,
and
we
didn’t
need
green
versus
new
kent
county.
brown
i
had
already
said
that’s
unconstitutional,
but
when
this
court
said
in
brown
ii,
we’re
going
to
give
you
some
--
in
effect
some
guidelines.
we’re
going
to
tell
you
what
you’ve
got
to
do
to
disestablish
the
existing
systems
and
then
it
followed
with
such
things
as
copper
versus
aaron
which
says
you’ve
got
to
take
steps
to
eliminate
formally
segregated
school
system,
root
and
branch,
and
when
it
comes
along
with
green
versus
new
kent
county
of
course
number
of
years
later
and
says,
the
boards
of
education
have
the
affirmative
duty
to
take
whatever
action
is
necessary
to
disestablish
the
dual
system.
that
clearly
calls
for
some
affirmative
move,
not
just
backing
off
and
leave
things
as
they
are.
that’s
the
way
we’ve
interpreted
the
decision
and
that’s
the
way
the
fifth
circuit
interpreted.
maybe
the
fifth
circuit
isn't
the
final
word,
but
we
are
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
we
have
to
honor
its
decision.
mr.
eugene
a.
epting
consequently
some
plan
had
to
be
formed
that
would
eliminate
the
mix
--
the
separation
in
the
school.
now,
a
neighborhood
plan
and
if
this
court
would
say
that
all
that
a
school
board
is
required
to
do
is
zone
without
discrimination
as
to
race
and
setup
a
neighborhood
plan,
we
can
do
it.
but
we’ll
have
some
black
schools
and
we’ll
have
some
white
schools
with
--
well,
we
had
one
with
525
whites
and
20
blacks.
we
had
another
one
with
approximately
500
whites
and
19
blacks
because
a
neighborhoods
are
made
up
that
way.
so,
as
i
say
the
result
of
our
efforts
is
that
in
--
and
we
had
some
five
to
four
decisions
in
that
board
or
rather
six
to
five
and
we
are
not
unanimous.
but,
our
decision
was
that
the
most
feasible
way
or
most
reasonable
way
as
those
who
preceded
me
have
discussed
mr.
griswold
i
believe,
was
to
zone
and
pick
up
an
area
that
is
not
contiguous
to
the
zone
and
take
the
children
from
that
area
to
the
zone
schools,
frankly
in
order
to
accomplish
what
we
understand
is
our
affirmative
duty.
now,
you
--
it
might
be
said
well
you
could
zone
in
such
a
way
as
to
bring
in
substantial
numbers
of
both
races.
the
pattern
in
our
--
this
is
a
county
wide
system,
it
involves
not
only
the
city
of
athens,
but
the
entire
county.
the
pattern
of
housing,
the
racial
distribution
is
such
that
when
you
step
out
to
pick
in,
pick
up
another
alien.
you
pick
up
more
of
what
we
might
call
the
wrong
race
then
you
do
of
the
race
that
you’re
trying
to
get
in,
so
that
won’t
wait.
we
were
told
too
that
it
might
be
possible
to
break
the
school
system
down
into
a
different
plan.
have
the
first
three
grades
or
the
first
four
grades
certain
schools,
have
the
fifth
and
sixth
or
the
fourth,
fifth,
and
sixth
in
other
schools.
when
you
do
that,
you’re
going
to
bus
over
the
entire
county
because
you’ve
got
to
have
a
bus
route
that
covers
the
entire
county
for
each
of
two
separate
sets
of
school
and
you’re
going
to
pick
up
the
young
children,
the
first
graders
from
an
area
adjacent
to
what
is
now
a
school
that
accommodates
them
and
take
them
off
to
some
other
school.
and
you
are
going
to
have
to
go
over
to
the
other
school
and
bring
back
some
fourth,
fifth,
and
sixth
graders,
or
fifth
and
sixth
whatever
it
is.
bring
them
from
next
door
to
a
school
over
to
one
that
accommodates
that
grades.
so
we
decided,
the
board
decided,
that
this
pocket
busing
was
the
most
feasible
way
of
working
out
the
problem
within
the
means
that
this
board
has.
now,
it
happens
that
no
plaintiff
in
the
lower
court
and
by
the
way
i
assume
this
court
has
the
information
as
to
how
this
thing
proceeded,
that
an
injunction
suit
or
two
injunction
suits
were
filed
in
the
superior
court
of
clarke
county,
injunctions
were
denied.
the
people,
the
plaintiffs
then
appeal
to
supreme
court
of
georgia
and
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
says,
that
in
taking
students
of
one
race
into
a
school
that
is
predominately
of
the
other
race
is
that,
that’s
discrimination
for
the
purpose
that
is
of
achieving
racial
balance,
that
is
discrimination
and
taking
then
people
out
of
that
school
in
order
to
make
room
for
those
you
brought
in
as
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
rights
of
those
taken
out.
now,
it
happens
that
nobody
included
in
any
of
these
four
of
the
five
pockets,
four
pockets,
that
are
being
bused
to
a
more
distant
school,
not
one
of
those
passengers
of
party
to
these
law
suits.
the
people
who
are
being
pocket
bused
are
not
complaining,
not
one
of
them.
when
you
pocket
bus
ohio
where
you
arrange
to
take
students
to
a
school
that’s
already
filled
to
capacity,
you
have
to
take
somebody
out
of
that
school
in
order
to
make
room
for
those
who
are
brought
in,
it’s
that
simple.
the
result
was
that
we
had
--
the
board
had
to
rezone
the
area
set
by
that
particular
school
or
those
particular
schools,
not
on
a
basis
of
excluding
whites
but
realigning
the
zones
so
that
the
students
in
those
areas
went
to
a
different
school.
we
had
to
make
room
for
those
are
brought
in.
if
the
georgia
court
is
right
in
saying
that
by
rezoning
in
order
to
accommodate
those
brought
in.
then
there
are
no
courses
left
open
to
a
board
of
education
except
the
freedom
of
choice
or
a
strict
neighborhood
zone,
living
the
racial
composition
to
stand
or
fall
on
zone
lines.
i
do
not
understand
that
this
court
has
given
us
that
right.
i
do
understand
that
the
fifth
circuit
courts
have
said
we
can’t
do
that
in
jefferson.
i
think
that
was
the
effect
of
one
of
the
decisions
in
mobil.
i
think
that
was
the
certainly
effect
of
the
decision
in
the
indianola
case
which
obviously
was
is
an
extreme
case.
i
think
that
was
the
effect
in
clarke
state.
so,
this
board
has
done
what
its
ordered
it
had
to
do
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
courts
of
the
fifth
circuit.
brown
ii
and
the
decisions
following
it
require
affirmative
action
by
the
school
boards.
new
kent
county
and
that
was
followed
in
rene
and
monroe
called
for
the
same
affirmative
duty
and
in
monroe
whereas
the
board
had
a
zone
plan
with
a
free
transport
provision,
the
court
plainly
held
that
the
affirmative
duty
was
not
satisfied
by
a
neighborhood
zone
plan
unless
it
resulted
in
the
substantial
mixing
of
races
in
all
of
the
schools.
now,
we
in
clarke
county
have
frankly,
we
have
gerrymandered
zone
not
to
achieve,
not
to
retain
segregation,
but
to
try
to
do
just
the
opposite,
to
try
to
make
some
in
the
schools,
to
avoid
the
entanglements
that
were
consequent
upon
maintaining
a
segregated
system.
we
obviously
had
dual
system
prior
to
1954.
we
begin
the
process
of
eliminating
that
in
1959
with
one
of
the
transfer
plans
which
were
sort
of
the
vogue
in
south
then.
in
1963,
prior
to
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
we
had
our
first
integration
in
clarke
county.
subsequent
to
that,
we
have
followed
various
methods
in
trying
to
get
our
system
--
keep
our
system
in
line
with
the
law
as
we
understood
it,
but
we
can’t
compete
with
the
decisions
of
one
court
saying
go
one
way
and
the
decisions
of
another
court
saying,
go
another.
we
have
to
know
where
to
go
and
this
decision
and
this
question
in
this
court
is
a
simple
question
but
its
answer
involves
tremendous
problems.
if
this
court
should
say,
you
have
complied
with
the
law
when
you
create
neighborhood
schools
that’s
alright.
but,
if
this
court
meant
what
it
said
when
it
said,
you
have
an
affirmative
duty
to
take
whatever
action
is
necessary
to
disestablish
the
dual
system
then,
we
think
this
court
would
have
to
uphold
the
action
which
is
taken
by
clarke
county
board
of
education.
mr.
eugene
a.
epting
well,
yes
whether
we
violated
the
construction
of
the
law
placed
on
it
by
the
georgia
supreme
court
--
mr.
eugene
a.
epting
the
georgia
supreme
court
in
using
the
green
case
as
its
basis
says
that
no
person
shall
be
excluded
from
a
school
because
of
its
race.
the
students,
the
white
students,
who
are
zoned
into
another
school
area
were
not
zoned
there
because
of
race,
but
obviously
they
were
zoned
there
because
black
students
were
being
brought
in.
now,
we
concede
that,
that’s
the
only
way
we
sort
to
worked
it
out.
mr.
eugene
a.
epting
the
school
boards
in
georgia
and
i'm
sure
this
is
true
more
or
less
nationwide,
have
a
broad
discretion
in
such
matters
and
only
the
school
board
can
solve
these
problems,
the
courts
can't
do
it,
i
mean,
the
mechanics
of
it.
the
school
board
has
to
solve
the
problems
facing
such
things
as
transportation,
availability
of
funds,
availability
of
school
facilities,
location
of
buildings.
the
board
has
a
discretion
under
number
of
decisions
of
the
georgia
courts
and
the
board
will
have
to
be
permitted
to
exercise
that
discretion
if
it
continues
to
operate
schools.
mr.
eugene
a.
epting
yes,
sir.
mr.
eugene
a.
epting
yes.
yes,
sir
i
do.
now,
the
next
point
that
i
would
like
to
mention
on
the
--
regard
to
the
decision
of
the
georgia
supreme
court
is
after
saying
that
the
action
of
clarke
county
board
of
education
in
the
adoption
of
its
plan
violated
to
fourteenth
amendment
rights
of
those
students
who
were
required
to
go
to
a
different
zone.
it
says
also
that
its
action
violates
those
provisions
of
the
civil
rights
act
dealing
with
the
definition
of
desegregation
407,
and
2000
(c)
and
2000
(d)
(6),
i
believe,
which
says,
that
desegregation
shall
not
mean
on
as
used
in
this
chapter.
desegregation
shall
not
mean
busing
to
achieve
a
racial
balance
and
in
the
second
section
the
2000
(c)
(6),
the
code
antedated,
that
no
court
or
public
by
or
public
body
--
federal
body,
i
believe
i
forget
the
exact
language,
shall
be
authorized
by
this
act
to
require
busing
to
achieve
racial
balance
in
that
sense.
now,
as
used
in
that
act
and
i
think
it
was
best
stated
in
the
olsen
case
in
the
district
court
of
new
york,
that
pertains
to
the
use
of
funds
under
that
section
--
of
that
title
of
that
act.
whatever
congress
may
have
meant
to
say,
it
isn’t
--
didn’t
put
a
restriction
on
the
discretionary
action
of
board
of
education.
the
georgia
court
says,
that
the
action
of
this
board
violates
the
provisions
of
that
section
of
the
civil
rights
act
and
i
don’t
think
it
does.
i
think
that
part
of
a
decision
is
also
in
error.
the
problem
that
we
have
is
the
basic
problem
which
faces
this
court.
what
exactly
is
a
school
board
required
to
do
and
what
can
the
school
board
do
in
order
to
meet
its
obligation?
obviously,
when
you
honor
the
rights
of
some
if
they
have
rights
in
regard
to
where
they
attend
the
school,
you
are
going
to
change
the
exercise
of
the
rights
of
others
where
your
school
system
is
filled
to
capacity.
i
would
like
to
call
this
point
to
the
attention
of
the
--
it’s
in
the
record,
but
the
attention
of
court
in
this
particular
instance.
the
people
except
for
three
who
have
children
who
walk
from
one
zone
to
a
school
in
another,
both
within
a
mile
and
hour
--
within
the
mile-and-half
both
schools,
except
for
those
three,
the
other
plaintiffs
in
the
trial
court
and
the
appellants
in
the
supreme
court
of
georgia,
those
people
were
sent
to
a
school
that
had
been
used
the
previous
year
to
house
a
particular
--
the
student
from
a
particular
neighborhood,
who
had
to
be
bused
to
that
school
because
the
school
in
their
neighborhood
was
under
construction.
consequently,
when
we
added
the
school,
69
school
year
and
the
school
in
that
particular
neighborhood,
the
new
school
had
been
completed,
we
had
a
substantially
empty
school
building.
we
had
to
use
it.
we
used
it
by
zoning
the
contagious
area
that
involves
these
plaintiffs
here,
these
respondents
here,
but
plaintiffs
in
the
court
below
by
bringing
them
to
that
school
with
the
exception
of
two
or
three,
they
had
to
be
bused
somewhere
and
it
was
logical
to
bus
in
to
the
school
where
the
space
was
available,
and
that
was
what
this
board
did.
that’s
one
of
the
little
details
that
only
a
board
can
solve.
we
ask
this
court
therefore
to
uphold
this
board
in
the
exercise
of
its
discretion
and
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
which
seems
to
curtail
our
exercise
of
that
discretion.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
eugene
a.
epting
excuse
me,
mr.
chief
justice
i
am
about
used
it
and
i
think
i
have
said
all
i
need
to
say.
mr.
eugene
a.
epting
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
the
court
will
find
that
this
case
is
somewhat
unique.
i
would
venture
to
say
that
in
most,
if
not
all,
of
the
cases
before
this
court
involving
boards
of
education,
the
board
has
been
here
either
complaining
that
it
should
not
be
required
to
do
what
its
been
told
and
asked
to
do
or
defending
itself,
in
claiming
that
it
has
done
all
that
it's
required
to
do.
here
you
have
the
board
of
education
defending
itself
against
the
charge
that
it’s
doing
too
much.
in
other
words,
clarke
county
board
of
education
has
tried
to
avoid
the
entanglement
of
federal
court
decisions
in
regard
to
the
question
of
desegregation.
so
far
it
has
succeeded
and
when
i
hear
and
read
the
arguments
in
regard
to
the
tribulations
of
charlotte
and
mobil
and
clarksdale,
bessemer,
jefferson,
i
think
they
have
acted
wisely
on
that
score.
but,
we
have
come
to
the
proposition
where
having
avoided
entanglement
and
federal
court
authors
running
our
of
schools,
we
find
ourselves
faced
with
as
a
state
court
injunction
that
says,
we
can’t
do
what
we
have
done,
because
in
undertaking
to
honor
the
fourteenth
amendment
rights
of
some
people,
we
are
thereby
violating
the
fourteenth
amendment
rights
of
others.
now,
i
would
agree
with
the
tenner
of
the
arguments
in
charlotte
that
all
of
these
busing
of
students
from
one
community
to
another
is
not
in
the
best
interest
of
the
education
is
that
--
if
i
understand
one
of
their
points
correctly,
but
in
the
clarke
county
case,
we
are
not
dealing
where
the
court
ordered
busing.
we
are
dealing
with
what
has
been
called
pocket
busing
to
a
limited
extent.
we
are
small
school
district.
we
have
only
11,000
students.
we
have
only
15
elementary
students.
we
call
it
pocket
busing,
in
charlotte
they
called
it
“satellite
zoning,”
but
it
means
the
same
thing.
in
undertaking
to
pocket
bus
and
if
the
court
wishes
to
look
at
the
record,
i
think
you
will
see
a
map
on
page
174
that
shows
the
geographical
locations
of
these
pockets
of
students
who
were
bused
to
schools
which
were
formally,
predominantly
of
the
other
race.
if
you
will
look
at
page
167,
you
will
see
the
chart
of
a
neighborhood
plan
which
was
best
adopted
by
this
court,
and
which
shows
the
extent,
the
chart
on
the
map
shows
the
extent
of
racial
mixing.
when
we
talk
about
desegregation
and
racial
balance
and
integration,
when
we
get
it
all
down
to
a
common
denominator,
we
are
talking
about
mixing
the
races
in
the
school,
that’s
what
it
amounts
to
in
plain
simple
language.
mr.
eugene
a.
epting
the
board
here
decided
to
--
well,
let's
put
it
this
way.
the
board
felt
that
under
the
judge
--
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
particularly
the
decisions
of
the
fifth
circuit
court,
we
were
compelled
to
do
it.
mr.
eugene
a.
epting
we
were
not
under
an
order
and
we
didn’t
want
to
get
under
an
order.
mr.
eugene
a.
epting
it’s
strikingly
similar
except
they’re
talking
about
a
statutory
--
mr.
eugene
a.
epting
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
now,
it
is
our
position
that
when
this
court
decided
brown
ii,
this
court
said
that
there
was
a
duty
on
the
boards
of
education
to
do
something
more
than
back
off
from
state
order
of
discrimination.
brown
i
had
already
said
that
and
if
that
was
all
we
required
to
do
is
stop
segregating
by
law
then
we
didn’t
need
brown
ii
and
we
didn’t
need
copper
versus
aaron,
and
we
didn’t
need
green
versus
new
kent
county.
brown
i
had
already
said
that’s
unconstitutional,
but
when
this
court
said
in
brown
ii,
we’re
going
to
give
you
some
--
in
effect
some
guidelines.
we’re
going
to
tell
you
what
you’ve
got
to
do
to
disestablish
the
existing
systems
and
then
it
followed
with
such
things
as
copper
versus
aaron
which
says
you’ve
got
to
take
steps
to
eliminate
formally
segregated
school
system,
root
and
branch,
and
when
it
comes
along
with
green
versus
new
kent
county
of
course
number
of
years
later
and
says,
the
boards
of
education
have
the
affirmative
duty
to
take
whatever
action
is
necessary
to
disestablish
the
dual
system.
that
clearly
calls
for
some
affirmative
move,
not
just
backing
off
and
leave
things
as
they
are.
that’s
the
way
we’ve
interpreted
the
decision
and
that’s
the
way
the
fifth
circuit
interpreted.
maybe
the
fifth
circuit
isn't
the
final
word,
but
we
are
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
we
have
to
honor
its
decision.
mr.
eugene
a.
epting
consequently
some
plan
had
to
be
formed
that
would
eliminate
the
mix
--
the
separation
in
the
school.
now,
a
neighborhood
plan
and
if
this
court
would
say
that
all
that
a
school
board
is
required
to
do
is
zone
without
discrimination
as
to
race
and
setup
a
neighborhood
plan,
we
can
do
it.
but
we’ll
have
some
black
schools
and
we’ll
have
some
white
schools
with
--
well,
we
had
one
with
525
whites
and
20
blacks.
we
had
another
one
with
approximately
500
whites
and
19
blacks
because
a
neighborhoods
are
made
up
that
way.
so,
as
i
say
the
result
of
our
efforts
is
that
in
--
and
we
had
some
five
to
four
decisions
in
that
board
or
rather
six
to
five
and
we
are
not
unanimous.
but,
our
decision
was
that
the
most
feasible
way
or
most
reasonable
way
as
those
who
preceded
me
have
discussed
mr.
griswold
i
believe,
was
to
zone
and
pick
up
an
area
that
is
not
contiguous
to
the
zone
and
take
the
children
from
that
area
to
the
zone
schools,
frankly
in
order
to
accomplish
what
we
understand
is
our
affirmative
duty.
now,
you
--
it
might
be
said
well
you
could
zone
in
such
a
way
as
to
bring
in
substantial
numbers
of
both
races.
the
pattern
in
our
--
this
is
a
county
wide
system,
it
involves
not
only
the
city
of
athens,
but
the
entire
county.
the
pattern
of
housing,
the
racial
distribution
is
such
that
when
you
step
out
to
pick
in,
pick
up
another
alien.
you
pick
up
more
of
what
we
might
call
the
wrong
race
then
you
do
of
the
race
that
you’re
trying
to
get
in,
so
that
won’t
wait.
we
were
told
too
that
it
might
be
possible
to
break
the
school
system
down
into
a
different
plan.
have
the
first
three
grades
or
the
first
four
grades
certain
schools,
have
the
fifth
and
sixth
or
the
fourth,
fifth,
and
sixth
in
other
schools.
when
you
do
that,
you’re
going
to
bus
over
the
entire
county
because
you’ve
got
to
have
a
bus
route
that
covers
the
entire
county
for
each
of
two
separate
sets
of
school
and
you’re
going
to
pick
up
the
young
children,
the
first
graders
from
an
area
adjacent
to
what
is
now
a
school
that
accommodates
them
and
take
them
off
to
some
other
school.
and
you
are
going
to
have
to
go
over
to
the
other
school
and
bring
back
some
fourth,
fifth,
and
sixth
graders,
or
fifth
and
sixth
whatever
it
is.
bring
them
from
next
door
to
a
school
over
to
one
that
accommodates
that
grades.
so
we
decided,
the
board
decided,
that
this
pocket
busing
was
the
most
feasible
way
of
working
out
the
problem
within
the
means
that
this
board
has.
now,
it
happens
that
no
plaintiff
in
the
lower
court
and
by
the
way
i
assume
this
court
has
the
information
as
to
how
this
thing
proceeded,
that
an
injunction
suit
or
two
injunction
suits
were
filed
in
the
superior
court
of
clarke
county,
injunctions
were
denied.
the
people,
the
plaintiffs
then
appeal
to
supreme
court
of
georgia
and
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
says,
that
in
taking
students
of
one
race
into
a
school
that
is
predominately
of
the
other
race
is
that,
that’s
discrimination
for
the
purpose
that
is
of
achieving
racial
balance,
that
is
discrimination
and
taking
then
people
out
of
that
school
in
order
to
make
room
for
those
you
brought
in
as
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
rights
of
those
taken
out.
now,
it
happens
that
nobody
included
in
any
of
these
four
of
the
five
pockets,
four
pockets,
that
are
being
bused
to
a
more
distant
school,
not
one
of
those
passengers
of
party
to
these
law
suits.
the
people
who
are
being
pocket
bused
are
not
complaining,
not
one
of
them.
when
you
pocket
bus
ohio
where
you
arrange
to
take
students
to
a
school
that’s
already
filled
to
capacity,
you
have
to
take
somebody
out
of
that
school
in
order
to
make
room
for
those
who
are
brought
in,
it’s
that
simple.
the
result
was
that
we
had
--
the
board
had
to
rezone
the
area
set
by
that
particular
school
or
those
particular
schools,
not
on
a
basis
of
excluding
whites
but
realigning
the
zones
so
that
the
students
in
those
areas
went
to
a
different
school.
we
had
to
make
room
for
those
are
brought
in.
if
the
georgia
court
is
right
in
saying
that
by
rezoning
in
order
to
accommodate
those
brought
in.
then
there
are
no
courses
left
open
to
a
board
of
education
except
the
freedom
of
choice
or
a
strict
neighborhood
zone,
living
the
racial
composition
to
stand
or
fall
on
zone
lines.
i
do
not
understand
that
this
court
has
given
us
that
right.
i
do
understand
that
the
fifth
circuit
courts
have
said
we
can’t
do
that
in
jefferson.
i
think
that
was
the
effect
of
one
of
the
decisions
in
mobil.
i
think
that
was
the
certainly
effect
of
the
decision
in
the
indianola
case
which
obviously
was
is
an
extreme
case.
i
think
that
was
the
effect
in
clarke
state.
so,
this
board
has
done
what
its
ordered
it
had
to
do
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
courts
of
the
fifth
circuit.
brown
ii
and
the
decisions
following
it
require
affirmative
action
by
the
school
boards.
new
kent
county
and
that
was
followed
in
rene
and
monroe
called
for
the
same
affirmative
duty
and
in
monroe
whereas
the
board
had
a
zone
plan
with
a
free
transport
provision,
the
court
plainly
held
that
the
affirmative
duty
was
not
satisfied
by
a
neighborhood
zone
plan
unless
it
resulted
in
the
substantial
mixing
of
races
in
all
of
the
schools.
now,
we
in
clarke
county
have
frankly,
we
have
gerrymandered
zone
not
to
achieve,
not
to
retain
segregation,
but
to
try
to
do
just
the
opposite,
to
try
to
make
some
in
the
schools,
to
avoid
the
entanglements
that
were
consequent
upon
maintaining
a
segregated
system.
we
obviously
had
dual
system
prior
to
1954.
we
begin
the
process
of
eliminating
that
in
1959
with
one
of
the
transfer
plans
which
were
sort
of
the
vogue
in
south
then.
in
1963,
prior
to
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
we
had
our
first
integration
in
clarke
county.
subsequent
to
that,
we
have
followed
various
methods
in
trying
to
get
our
system
--
keep
our
system
in
line
with
the
law
as
we
understood
it,
but
we
can’t
compete
with
the
decisions
of
one
court
saying
go
one
way
and
the
decisions
of
another
court
saying,
go
another.
we
have
to
know
where
to
go
and
this
decision
and
this
question
in
this
court
is
a
simple
question
but
its
answer
involves
tremendous
problems.
if
this
court
should
say,
you
have
complied
with
the
law
when
you
create
neighborhood
schools
that’s
alright.
but,
if
this
court
meant
what
it
said
when
it
said,
you
have
an
affirmative
duty
to
take
whatever
action
is
necessary
to
disestablish
the
dual
system
then,
we
think
this
court
would
have
to
uphold
the
action
which
is
taken
by
clarke
county
board
of
education.
mr.
eugene
a.
epting
well,
yes
whether
we
violated
the
construction
of
the
law
placed
on
it
by
the
georgia
supreme
court
--
mr.
eugene
a.
epting
the
georgia
supreme
court
in
using
the
green
case
as
its
basis
says
that
no
person
shall
be
excluded
from
a
school
because
of
its
race.
the
students,
the
white
students,
who
are
zoned
into
another
school
area
were
not
zoned
there
because
of
race,
but
obviously
they
were
zoned
there
because
black
students
were
being
brought
in.
now,
we
concede
that,
that’s
the
only
way
we
sort
to
worked
it
out.
mr.
eugene
a.
epting
the
school
boards
in
georgia
and
i'm
sure
this
is
true
more
or
less
nationwide,
have
a
broad
discretion
in
such
matters
and
only
the
school
board
can
solve
these
problems,
the
courts
can't
do
it,
i
mean,
the
mechanics
of
it.
the
school
board
has
to
solve
the
problems
facing
such
things
as
transportation,
availability
of
funds,
availability
of
school
facilities,
location
of
buildings.
the
board
has
a
discretion
under
number
of
decisions
of
the
georgia
courts
and
the
board
will
have
to
be
permitted
to
exercise
that
discretion
if
it
continues
to
operate
schools.
mr.
eugene
a.
epting
yes,
sir.
mr.
eugene
a.
epting
yes.
yes,
sir
i
do.
now,
the
next
point
that
i
would
like
to
mention
on
the
--
regard
to
the
decision
of
the
georgia
supreme
court
is
after
saying
that
the
action
of
clarke
county
board
of
education
in
the
adoption
of
its
plan
violated
to
fourteenth
amendment
rights
of
those
students
who
were
required
to
go
to
a
different
zone.
it
says
also
that
its
action
violates
those
provisions
of
the
civil
rights
act
dealing
with
the
definition
of
desegregation
407,
and
2000
(c)
and
2000
(d)
(6),
i
believe,
which
says,
that
desegregation
shall
not
mean
on
as
used
in
this
chapter.
desegregation
shall
not
mean
busing
to
achieve
a
racial
balance
and
in
the
second
section
the
2000
(c)
(6),
the
code
antedated,
that
no
court
or
public
by
or
public
body
--
federal
body,
i
believe
i
forget
the
exact
language,
shall
be
authorized
by
this
act
to
require
busing
to
achieve
racial
balance
in
that
sense.
now,
as
used
in
that
act
and
i
think
it
was
best
stated
in
the
olsen
case
in
the
district
court
of
new
york,
that
pertains
to
the
use
of
funds
under
that
section
--
of
that
title
of
that
act.
whatever
congress
may
have
meant
to
say,
it
isn’t
--
didn’t
put
a
restriction
on
the
discretionary
action
of
board
of
education.
the
georgia
court
says,
that
the
action
of
this
board
violates
the
provisions
of
that
section
of
the
civil
rights
act
and
i
don’t
think
it
does.
i
think
that
part
of
a
decision
is
also
in
error.
the
problem
that
we
have
is
the
basic
problem
which
faces
this
court.
what
exactly
is
a
school
board
required
to
do
and
what
can
the
school
board
do
in
order
to
meet
its
obligation?
obviously,
when
you
honor
the
rights
of
some
if
they
have
rights
in
regard
to
where
they
attend
the
school,
you
are
going
to
change
the
exercise
of
the
rights
of
others
where
your
school
system
is
filled
to
capacity.
i
would
like
to
call
this
point
to
the
attention
of
the
--
it’s
in
the
record,
but
the
attention
of
court
in
this
particular
instance.
the
people
except
for
three
who
have
children
who
walk
from
one
zone
to
a
school
in
another,
both
within
a
mile
and
hour
--
within
the
mile-and-half
both
schools,
except
for
those
three,
the
other
plaintiffs
in
the
trial
court
and
the
appellants
in
the
supreme
court
of
georgia,
those
people
were
sent
to
a
school
that
had
been
used
the
previous
year
to
house
a
particular
--
the
student
from
a
particular
neighborhood,
who
had
to
be
bused
to
that
school
because
the
school
in
their
neighborhood
was
under
construction.
consequently,
when
we
added
the
school,
69
school
year
and
the
school
in
that
particular
neighborhood,
the
new
school
had
been
completed,
we
had
a
substantially
empty
school
building.
we
had
to
use
it.
we
used
it
by
zoning
the
contagious
area
that
involves
these
plaintiffs
here,
these
respondents
here,
but
plaintiffs
in
the
court
below
by
bringing
them
to
that
school
with
the
exception
of
two
or
three,
they
had
to
be
bused
somewhere
and
it
was
logical
to
bus
in
to
the
school
where
the
space
was
available,
and
that
was
what
this
board
did.
that’s
one
of
the
little
details
that
only
a
board
can
solve.
we
ask
this
court
therefore
to
uphold
this
board
in
the
exercise
of
its
discretion
and
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
which
seems
to
curtail
our
exercise
of
that
discretion.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
eugene
a.
epting
excuse
me,
mr.
chief
justice
i
am
about
used
it
and
i
think
i
have
said
all
i
need
to
say.
