mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
it
please
the
court.
i’d
like
to
direct
some
remarks
at
the
outset
to
some
tests
that
have
been
proposed
here
and
then
deal
specifically
with
the
contentions
of
the
petition.
four
different
tests
as
i
understand
it,
have
been
proposed
by
the
counsel
in
the
cases
that
have
been
argued
here
yesterday
and
today.
the
fifth
circuit
itself
has
postulated
a
rule
which
declares
that
the
duty
of
each
system
to
prevent
the
existence
of
an
old
black
school,
it
quote
reasonable
alternatives
exist.
when
all
black
schools
do
exist,
the
fifth
circuit
has
said
that
the
state
of
a
system
must
specify
valid
reasons
for
those
schools.
further,
the
fifth
circuit
draws
a
distinction
between
not
only
between
the
jury
and
de
facto
systems,
but
in
addition,
it
draws
a
distinction
between
urban
systems
on
the
one
hand
and
rural
systems
on
the
other.
this
is
indicated
from
its
decisions
in
the
orange
county
in
hillsboro
cases
on
the
one
hand,
involving
urban
systems
and
its
decision
in
the
monroe
louisiana
case,
involving
a
rule
system.
now,
the
fourth
circuit
has
postulated
a
rule
in
the
charlotte
case
in
terms
of
whether
the
all
black
schools
are
capable
of
abolition
by
reasonable
means.
the
justice
department
in
its
brief
refers
to
a
rule
of
feasibility
which
seems
to
be
taken
from
the
green
case.
the
petitioners
in
charlotte
and
in
mobil
cases
on
the
other
hand,
had
stated
a
point
blank
requirement
that,
“every
black
child
is
to
be
free
from
assignment
to
a
black
school,
an
identifiable
racial
minority
school
at
every
grade,
subject
only
to
this
qualification”
in
the
case
of
“absolute
on
work
ability.”
now,
apparently
this
exception
is
aimed
that
such
places
as
washington
and
new
york
where
it
would
be
physically
impossible
to
bring
about
a
realization
of
what
they
seek.
we
submit
in
this
case
that
all
of
these
tests
miss
the
point.
they
involve
standards
which
differ
only
and
only
in
degree.
under
them,
the
sufficiency
of
a
plan
is
made
to
depend
upon
a
statistical
appraisal.
they
involve
court
formulated
test
which
we
submit
if
any
state
legislature
had
attempted
to
enact
would
have
immediately
been
declared
unconstitutional
by
this
court
as
being
void
for
vagueness.
we
submit
that
they
invite
another
generation
of
litigation.
they
either
avoid
or
assume
without
acknowledging
it,
a
determination
of
the
basic
question
which
lurks
in
all
of
these
cases
that
have
been
argued
thus
far
and
that
is
what
does
the
constitution
require.
what
did
you
mean
in
brown?
does
the
constitution
simply
prohibit
state
enforced
discrimination
or
does
it
require
an
actual
integration
of
the
races
in
the
school.
now,
the
problem
it
seems
to
me,
with
the
position
of
the
government
and
the
position
that
the
petitioners
in
this
case
have
to
take
is
that
they
seem
to
assume
that
the
constitution
does
require
integration
except
where
it’s
not
reasonable,
where
it’s
not
feasible
or
whether
it’s
absolutely
unworkable.
now,
this
we
submit
is
inconsistent
because
it
makes
the
scope
of
a
constitutional
right
depend
upon
the
readily
availability
of
a
remedy.
and
it
would
make
the
rights
of
a
minority
child
differ
in
places
such
as
new
york
and
atlanta
or
in
charlotte,
north
carolina.
the
position
of
respondents
and
they
are
both
black
and
white
respondents,
i
think
the
court
probably
is
aware
then
in
this
case.
they
were
both
black
and
white
parents
that
were
objecting
to
being
assigned
on
the
basis
of
race
in
order
to
bring
about
this
20%
to
40%
ratio
on
each
school
that
the
petitioners
were
seeking
implement.
our
position
is
simply
that
the
constitution
does
not
require
affirmative
state
enforced
integration,
but
that
it
only
prohibits
state
enforced
segregation.
so
being
we
say
that
the
assignment
of
children
to
achieve
racial
balancing
is
not
required,
but
is
unconstitutional.
consequently,
the
majority
to
minority
transfer
option
has
been
discussed,
we
submit
that
also
is
not
valid
anymore
and
the
minority
to
majority
transfer
option
struck
down
in
(inaudible)
is
valid.
and
secondly,
mr.
justice
white,
i
don’t
think
it’s
involved
in
this
case
for
reasons
that
i
will
get
to,
and
we
--
but
we
submit
that
a
state
or
a
board
of
education
cannot
own
its
own
policy
determination
in
an
effort
to
alleviate
de
facto
or
whatever
you
call
it,
racial
balance,
undertake
to
affirmatively
assigned
students
on
the
basis
of
race
in
order
to
bring
about
a
racial
balance.
now,
i
will
attempt
to
show
later
on
that
that
is
not
involved
in
this
case
because
the
clarke
county
board
of
education
was
not
acting
voluntarily,
but
according
to
the
testimony
of
it
superintendent
at
page
97
of
the
record,
he
said,
we
are
acting
because
we
are
under
compulsion
of
hew,
they
are
about
to
cut
off
the
money.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
if
hew’s
action
is
valid,
of
course
that
would
be
true,
but
we
deny
that
hew’s
action
is
valid.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
before
brown,
yes.
after
brown
i
say
no.
but
i
qualify
that
by
saying
that
the
court
does
not
have
to
make
that
holding
in
this
case
in
order
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
thought
i
understood
the
justice
to
propose
a
question
whereby
the
board
voluntarily
and
without
compulsion
elected
to
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
you
assume
my
case
then.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
correct.
if
they
are
acting
pursuant
to
a
statute,
but
i
understood
the
question
to
pre-suppose
that
the
statute
was
constitutional.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
would
answer
your
question
this
way
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
that
is
perhaps
a
difference
between
what
the
constitution
requires
on
the
one
hand
and
what
it
permits
on
the
other.
i
will
attempt
to
develop
that
momentarily
because
i
think
it
involves
some
prior
decisions
of
this
court.
now
we
say
that
this
position
that
we
maintain
follows
from
--
for
several
reasons.
first,
the
language
of
brown
itself
and
the
overwhelming
judicial
interpretation
placed
upon
it
within
the
first
decade
after
1954,
we
have
collected
those
cases
in
our
brief.
this
court’s
decision
in
the
(inaudible)
case
itself
states
the
rule
in
terms
of
a
classification
based
on
race
for
the
purpose
of
transfer
between
public
schools
as
here.
the
wording
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
we
rely
upon
that.
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
negative,
it
is
not
affirmative.
it
confers
an
immunity
upon
people
to
be
free
from
discriminatory
governmental
action.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
in
4
or
5
enforcement
clause?
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
in
that
respect,
it
certainly
is,
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
we
do
not
think
so.
you
have
the
hew
provisions
of
title
six
that
are
involved,
but
i
do
not
interpret
those
as
presenting
the
issue
that
you
have
proposed.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
interpret
the
affirmative
duty
language
of
this
court’s
decision
in
green
to
mean
this
mr.
justice
marshall
that
no
school
board
who
had
de
jure
school
system
in
1954
or
at
any
other
time
could
simply
sit
back
and
not
do
anything.
i
think
it
was
a
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
think
they
were
required
to
reorganize
their
attendant
zones
to
change
their
method
of
assigning
students
to
school.
i
think
they
were
required
to
eliminate
faculty
desegregation
or
faculty
segregation.
i
think
i
should
add,
hasten
to
add
that
a
lot
of
these
things
that
are
clear
now
were
not
clear
five
and
even
10
years
ago
because
school
boards
have
labored
under
a
degree
of
uncertainty.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
the
school
board
in
clarke
county,
georgia?
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
they
did
two
things
wrong.
they
gerrymandered
the
attendance
lines
with
--
for
the
express
purpose
of
bringing
about
a
20:40
ratio
mix.
secondly,
being
unable
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
how
is
that
so?
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
the
equal
protection
clause
as
interpreted
by
this
court
in
the
brown
case
and
a
number
of
fifth
circuit
decisions
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
the
brown
case
said
that
any
assignment
of
peoples
by
race
is
a
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws,
that
is
my
interpretation.
that
is
the
basic
issue
that
i
think
you’ve
got
to
decide
today.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that’s
right
sir,
but
the
fact
that
you
assigned
them
by
zones
or
by
race
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
certainly
not,
certainly
not.
i'm
saying
that
any
board
and
this
is
based
upon
the
law
as
it
has
been
developed
in
green,
not
perhaps
as
some
of
us
assume
back
in
1955,
because
this
court
itself
upheld
a
pupil
placement
plan
in
the
shuttlesworth
case
that
on
its
face
provided
for
the
racial
assignment
of
pupils.
now,
looking
back
it’s
probably
that
was
an
interim
remedial
device.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
there’s
no
question
about
that.
we
aren't
disputing
that.
the
question
that
we
are
in
disagreement
about
is
what
do
they
have
to
do.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no,
sir.
i
don’t
accept
the
premise.
i
think
you
presuppose
that
you
can
deny
rights
to
one
group
in
order
to
call
them
to
another
and
that
would
mean
that
the
constitution
then
would
become
a
suicide
pact.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
well,
the
disagreement
comes
on
what
you
meant
when
you
said
that.
did
you
mean
that
you’ve
got
to
affirmatively
consider
race
or
did
you
mean
simply
that
this
--
the
boards
of
the
systems
involved
in
those
three
cases
could
not
continue
to
use
systems
of
assignment
that
were
racial?
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
think
there
has
to
be.
i
think
there
has
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes
sir,
i
think
that
there
has
to
be.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
well,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
don’t
concede
that
that
would
be
the
result
of
not
giving
consideration
to
race.
and
even
if
you
had
a
situation
where
you
ended
up
with
that
result
that
would
to
me
not
necessarily
carry
with
it
the
proposition
that
discrimination
had
been
practiced,
though
that
--
the
formal
dual
system
had
not
been
dismantled.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
certainly
not,
certainly
not.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
think
that
the
board
would
have
to
revise
its
assignment
policy.
it
could
do
either
one
of
two
ways.
it
could
go
to
pure
freedom
of
choice
plan,
not
the
freedom
of
choice
plan
that
this
court
struck
down
in
the
three
cases
in
1968.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
the
other
would
be
to
simply
draw
district
lines,
it
would
not
base
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
would
certainly
hope
so.
in
fact,
i
was
going
to
suggest
to
mr.
justice
douglas
that
that
would
be
the
answer
to
his
question,
about
how
you
could
get
these
people
out
of
the
ghettos.
it
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
you
would
have
a
freedom
of
choice
plan
under
which
the
choice
was
actually
free.
the
problem
in
the
green
case,
the
rene
case,
and
the
monroe
case
is
that
the
choice
was
not
in
fact
free,
but
that
the
systems
in
all
three
cases
continued
to
assign
students
on
the
basis
of
race.
in
the
kent
case,
where
the
student
did
not
exercise
the
choice,
he
was
automatically
put
back
in
the
school
to
which
he
had
been
assigned
on
the
racial
basis.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes,
sir
i
do.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
mr.
chief
justice,
i
will
express
it
this
way.
much
of
the
law
that
has
been
developed
in
green
and
other
cases,
perhaps
this
court
meant
in
brown,
but
i
would
say
this
that
very
few
school
attorneys
or
others
interpreted
many
of
the
things
that
the
court
has
since
required.
it
was
assumed,
for
example
after
briggs
versus
elliot
for
a
long
time
and
this
is
going
back
in
ancient
history,
and
perhaps
its
difficult
to
visualize
that
this
was
once
assumed
to
be
possible,
but
you
have
the
pupil
placement
plans
that
said
that
students
remain
where
they
are
albeit
they
were
putted
there
on
a
racial
basis.
but
they
are
permitted
to
transfer
out
by
meeting
a
list
of
17
criteria
that
were
set
out
in
the
shuttlesworth
case
and
this
court
upheld
that
in
the
late
50’s
or
the
early
60’s,
i’m
not
sure
of
which.
well,
the
law
as
evolved
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
the
charlotte
case
to
say
that
the
same
law
is
in
effect
in
1969
or
1968
that
the
courts,
including
the
courts
of
appeals
assume
was
the
law
in
1955
is
simply
missing
the
point
because
it’s
not
sold.
the
concepts
in
this
area
have
changed
and
i’m
not
saying
that
they
shouldn't
have
changed,
i’m
simply
saying
that
what
a
system
did
not
do
in
1955
should
not
indict
it
at
this
time
on
the
basis
of
requirements
that
we
feel
have
been
imposed
only
by
decisions
starting
in
about
1967
in
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
jefferson
and
in
the
green
case
in
1968.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
think
a
school
system
has
to
completely
change
its
method
of
assigning
students
from
the
old
system.
the
old
basis
in
most
southern
school
districts
was
a
neighborhood
plan
except
you
had
dual
zones,
you
had
one
for
black
and
one
for
white.
i
think
a
system
in
order
to
carry
out
its
affirmative
duty
has
to
erase
those
dual
zones
and
it
has
to
draw
a
line.
it
wants
to
go
a
neighborhood
plan
and
say,
students
on
this
side
will
go
to
this
school,
students
on
that
side
will
go
that
school.
i
think
the
system
as
this
court
interpreted
by
saying
in
green.
could
on
the
other
hand,
go
to
a
pure
uninhibited
freedom
of
choice.
now,
the
problem
in
green
and
the
other
cases
is
that
the
choice
was
not
free
and
we
have
attempted
to
distinguish
those
cases
in
our
brief
at
page
29,
i
believe.
now
all
three
of
them
and
show
that
in
each
instance,
the
free
choice
plans
involved
in
those
three
systems
continued
to
make
initial
assignments
in
one
form
or
another
of
students
on
the
basis
of
race
and
then
put
the
burden
on
them
to
get
out
of
it.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
correct
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
well,
those
of
the
two
types
of
plans
that
immediately
come
to
my
mind.
i
say
now
if
a
system
wants
to
consolidate
all
of
its
schools
and
out
them
all
in
one,
i
think
it
could
do
that
and
that
would
set
to
solve
the
problem.
i
think
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
we
concede
those,
we
concede
though.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
certainly,
faculties,
extra
curricular
activities,
athletics,
there
are
other
five
or
six
points
that
are
referred
to
in
green.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
what
insulates
it?
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
don’t
think
that
it
is.
if
the
assignment
of
that
teacher
is
motivated
by
considerations
of
race
whether
to
achieve
a
particular
racial
balance
or
otherwise,
we
submit,
it
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
certainly,
that’s
right.
now,
you
have
a
difference
in
that
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no
sir,
certainly
not.
but
i’m
saying
this
that
the
system
cannot
continue
under
the
old
arrangement.
one
solution
might
be
to
simply
to
undo
the
affects,
to
simply
put
all
the
names
in
a
hat,
maybe
classify
some
of
them
that
perhaps
it
would
not
be
qualified
to
go
into
a
particular
school
and
then
draw
the
names
out.
in
that
way
you
will
have
the
pure
chance
say
you
are
coming
in.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no,
sir.
but
it
would
be
one
way
to
avoid
containing
the
affects
of
past
discrimination.
it
may
not
be
educationally
wise,
but
i’m
trying
to
postulate
something
in
terms
of
satisfying
cure.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that’s
quite
possible.
perhaps
the
--
i
think
what
should
have
been
done
and
we
recognize
now
and
the
court's
decision
is
that
as
replacements
were
made,
they
should
have
been
made
on
a
nonracial
basis.
and
perhaps
in
many
instances
they
were
not
and
practically
the
way
it
works
is
that
the
principal
of
each
school
usually
goes
out
to
the
teachers
and
the
black
principals
get
the
black
teachers
and
the
white
one
gets
the
white.
this
court
has
told
us
that
that’s
wrong
and
we
recognize
that,
regard--
you
can’t
delegate
it
to
someone.
the
fifth
circuit
has
stated
what
i’m
trying
to
state
in
these
terms
or
first,
let
me
say
this.
in
the
houston
case,
the
judge
there
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
constitution
guarantees
the
right
to
vote.
it
guarantees
the
right
to
ride
buses
free
of
discrimination,
but
the
constitution
does
not
require
that
person
vote
and
it
does
not
require
that
he
ride
the
bus
in
any
particular
manner.
he
can
go
to
the
--
still
go
to
the
back
or
he
can
go
to
the
front,
anywhere
else
that
he
wants
to.
the
fifth
circuit
said
this.
the
constitution
affords
in
these
rights
not
recognized
until
a
recently.
it
does
not
impose
an
obligation
on
him
to
exercise
them.
it
is
for
him
to
decide
whether
it
be
to
his
advantage,
individual
is
still
the
master
of
his
fate.
and
we
say
thirdly,
that
all
students
cannot
be
assigned
to
schools
on
the
basis
of
race
without
at
the
same
time
violating
the
rights
of
those
students
both
black
and
white
and
there
four
instead
of
three
here
as
mr.
epting
said,
without
at
the
same
time
violating
the
rights
of
the
black
and
white
pupils
who
object
to
being
assigned
on
the
basis
of
race.
i
think
for
this
purpose
we
can
assume,
although,
we
will
certainly
not
concede
the
validity
of
this
proposition
that
says
that
educational
or
equal
education
opportunity
cannot
be
achieve
in
fact
unless
there
is
an
actual
integration
of
the
races.
but
assuming
that,
it
does
not
follow,
we
submit,
that
the
rights
of
the
groups
seeking
compulsory
association
to
achieve
this
end
of
equal
educational
opportunity
can
be
superior
to
those
who
seek
to
avoid
it
and
this
court
said
this
in
shirley
versus
kramer.
the
constitution
confers
upon
no
individual
the
right
to
demand
action
by
the
state
which
results
in
the
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws
to
other
individuals.
it’s
never
been
constitutional
doctrine
that
the
rights
of
one
group
seeking
this
can
be
used
as
a
pretext
for
denying
him
to
another
group.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
mr.
justice
black,
i
would
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
mr.
justice
black
there
is
certainly
a
difference
between
the
power
of
congress
under
the
enforcement
clause
and
the
power
of
a
court
proceeding
in
the
context
of
these
cases.
i
would
say
that
congress
could
not
do
it.
i
stood
here
about
four
years
ago
and
argued
a
voting
rights
case
and
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no
sir,
it’s
certainly
does
not
because
the
difference
between
--
it's
the
difference
between
the
power
of
congress
which
is
given
the
authority
to
implement
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
power
of
the
courts
which
are
not
given
that
express
authority,
but
necessarily
have
to
enforce
part
of
it.
and
another
appearance
of
the
houston
case
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
not
mutually
exclusive.
i
don’t
think
they
are
identical.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i’m
not
certain
i
understand
what
you
mean
by
mutually
exclusive
under
the
enforcement
clause?
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
well,
congress
of
course
has
enacted
certain
statutes
1983,
1981
on
which
all
suits
are
brought,
but
i
don’t
think
that
the
court
has
interpreted
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
being
limited
to
the
express
provisions
spelled
out
by
congress
in
statute.
the
court
has
said
that
it
has
certain
powers
and
responsibilities
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
independent
of
the
statute,
but
it
does
not
follow
that
its
power
is
the
same
or
can
be
equated
to
in
the
absence
of
the
statute
to
the
power
that
it
would
have
if
congress
had
enacted
a
statute.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
would
think
not
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that's
right.
it’s
expressing
it
more
directly.
i
would
like
to
distinguish
two
doctrines
that
are
relied
upon
in
these
cases
by
the
plaintiffs
or
the
petitioners.
it
said
that
there
are
two
doctrines
that
can
be
used
to
support
this
and
one
is
the
remedying
the
effects
of
past
discrimination
and
the
disestablishment
cases.
in
the
one
instance
reliance
is
placed
upon
the
voting
cases
involving
the
freezing
principle.
all
the
answer
to
that
simply
is
this
that
there
you
can
accomplish
your
remedial
device
without
denying
the
rights
of
the
whites
and
blacks
who
object.
in
the
freezing
cases
you
have
two
classes,
one
of
which
was
granted
certain
rights
and
one
of
which
was
denied
it
and
in
that
context
you
simply
confer
the
rights
on
the
class
that
were
denied
and
you
don’t
take
anything
away
from
the
other
class
that
was
granted
the
favored
treatment.
in
the
disestablishment
cases,
the
reliance
is
placed
upon
the
--
a
lot
of
cases
in
any
trust
fields
saying
that
having
found
an
illegal
combination
or
something
in
violation
of
law,
that
the
courts
can
go
further
than
simply
issuing
a
prohibitory
injunction
aimed
at
the
future
and
can
require
retroactively
a
divestiture
or
a
dissolution
of
the
illegal
combination.
there
the
courts
are
dealing
with
entirely
with
wrong
doers.
everybody
has
had
some
culpability
involved
in
that
situation.
so,
there
is
no
problem
presented
in
saying
that
we
can
rob
you
of
the
fruits
of
this
illegal
conspiracy,
but
here,
you
have
innocent
white
and
black
children
who
are
objecting
to
this
treatment
and
their
rights
cannot
be
made,
we
submit
to
be
sacrificed
in
order
to
order
to
accord
the
rights
to
somebody
else.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no,
sir.
that
would
still
involve
an
initial
assignment
by
race
if
the
lines
were
gerrymandered.
now,
i’m
not
certain
that
i
understood
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
if
the
lines
were
not
based
on
race,
i
think
what
the
chief
justice
has
said
would
be
correct
that
that
plan
would
be
valid
in
superimposing
an
absolute,
completely
freedom
of
choice
option
on
top
of
it
would
not
invalidate
it.
but,
if
you
presuppose
that
in
drawing
these
lines
or
in
going
to
these
parings
that
this
was
based
upon
race,
i
think
you’re
right
back
where
you
started.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no,
sir.
the
cases
in
the
fifth
circuit
struck
down,
the
old
pupil
placement
statutes
on
that
very
reasoning.
that
even
though
they
gave
the
student
an
unlimited
right
to
transfer
out
that
he
was
still
initially
assigned
to
the
old
school
that
he
had
been
assigned
to
on
the
basis
of
race
and
the
burden
was
putted
on
him
to
do
that
which
the
board
of
education
itself
should
have
carried
on.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
the
proposition
that
i
formulated
in
response
to
a
question
that
mr.
justice
douglas
had
asked,
was
that
it
was
not
any
zoning
to
begin
with
but
a
complete
freedom
of
choice
along
the
lines
that
fifth
circuits
said
out
in
the
jefferson
case
in
372
f2nd
836
where
they
said
that,
they
set
out
the
requirements
and
said
that,
if
a
student
does
not
assign
himself,
you
have
to
assigned
him
to
the
nearest
school
on
the
basis
of
proximity.
coming
back
momentarily
to
this
question,
i
think
these
--
the
arguments
that
have
been
made
here
in
which
is
it
is
said
that
the
remedial
aspects
of
this
in
order
to
give
the
remedy,
the
courts
can
do
this.
it
comes
down
to
this
that
can
a
remedial
device
be
employed
which
denies
a
substantive
right
to
another
class?
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes
sir,
they
had
enforcement
proceedings
pending
against
them,
they
had
been
already
threatened
with
one
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no
sir.
we
certainly
challenge
it.
that
the
board
had
adopted
a
bona
fide
neighborhood
plan
which
eliminated
it
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes,
sir,
we
do.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that’s
correct
sir.
i
would
although
my
time
is
up,
but
i
would
point
out
that
we
also
contend
that
this
plan
is
void
because
it
placed
unequal
burden
upon
the
negro
respondents
by
requiring
them
to
be
assigned
out
of
their
zones
where
it
did
not
impose
that
upon
the
whites.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
it
please
the
court.
i’d
like
to
direct
some
remarks
at
the
outset
to
some
tests
that
have
been
proposed
here
and
then
deal
specifically
with
the
contentions
of
the
petition.
four
different
tests
as
i
understand
it,
have
been
proposed
by
the
counsel
in
the
cases
that
have
been
argued
here
yesterday
and
today.
the
fifth
circuit
itself
has
postulated
a
rule
which
declares
that
the
duty
of
each
system
to
prevent
the
existence
of
an
old
black
school,
it
quote
reasonable
alternatives
exist.
when
all
black
schools
do
exist,
the
fifth
circuit
has
said
that
the
state
of
a
system
must
specify
valid
reasons
for
those
schools.
further,
the
fifth
circuit
draws
a
distinction
between
not
only
between
the
jury
and
de
facto
systems,
but
in
addition,
it
draws
a
distinction
between
urban
systems
on
the
one
hand
and
rural
systems
on
the
other.
this
is
indicated
from
its
decisions
in
the
orange
county
in
hillsboro
cases
on
the
one
hand,
involving
urban
systems
and
its
decision
in
the
monroe
louisiana
case,
involving
a
rule
system.
now,
the
fourth
circuit
has
postulated
a
rule
in
the
charlotte
case
in
terms
of
whether
the
all
black
schools
are
capable
of
abolition
by
reasonable
means.
the
justice
department
in
its
brief
refers
to
a
rule
of
feasibility
which
seems
to
be
taken
from
the
green
case.
the
petitioners
in
charlotte
and
in
mobil
cases
on
the
other
hand,
had
stated
a
point
blank
requirement
that,
“every
black
child
is
to
be
free
from
assignment
to
a
black
school,
an
identifiable
racial
minority
school
at
every
grade,
subject
only
to
this
qualification”
in
the
case
of
“absolute
on
work
ability.”
now,
apparently
this
exception
is
aimed
that
such
places
as
washington
and
new
york
where
it
would
be
physically
impossible
to
bring
about
a
realization
of
what
they
seek.
we
submit
in
this
case
that
all
of
these
tests
miss
the
point.
they
involve
standards
which
differ
only
and
only
in
degree.
under
them,
the
sufficiency
of
a
plan
is
made
to
depend
upon
a
statistical
appraisal.
they
involve
court
formulated
test
which
we
submit
if
any
state
legislature
had
attempted
to
enact
would
have
immediately
been
declared
unconstitutional
by
this
court
as
being
void
for
vagueness.
we
submit
that
they
invite
another
generation
of
litigation.
they
either
avoid
or
assume
without
acknowledging
it,
a
determination
of
the
basic
question
which
lurks
in
all
of
these
cases
that
have
been
argued
thus
far
and
that
is
what
does
the
constitution
require.
what
did
you
mean
in
brown?
does
the
constitution
simply
prohibit
state
enforced
discrimination
or
does
it
require
an
actual
integration
of
the
races
in
the
school.
now,
the
problem
it
seems
to
me,
with
the
position
of
the
government
and
the
position
that
the
petitioners
in
this
case
have
to
take
is
that
they
seem
to
assume
that
the
constitution
does
require
integration
except
where
it’s
not
reasonable,
where
it’s
not
feasible
or
whether
it’s
absolutely
unworkable.
now,
this
we
submit
is
inconsistent
because
it
makes
the
scope
of
a
constitutional
right
depend
upon
the
readily
availability
of
a
remedy.
and
it
would
make
the
rights
of
a
minority
child
differ
in
places
such
as
new
york
and
atlanta
or
in
charlotte,
north
carolina.
the
position
of
respondents
and
they
are
both
black
and
white
respondents,
i
think
the
court
probably
is
aware
then
in
this
case.
they
were
both
black
and
white
parents
that
were
objecting
to
being
assigned
on
the
basis
of
race
in
order
to
bring
about
this
20%
to
40%
ratio
on
each
school
that
the
petitioners
were
seeking
implement.
our
position
is
simply
that
the
constitution
does
not
require
affirmative
state
enforced
integration,
but
that
it
only
prohibits
state
enforced
segregation.
so
being
we
say
that
the
assignment
of
children
to
achieve
racial
balancing
is
not
required,
but
is
unconstitutional.
consequently,
the
majority
to
minority
transfer
option
has
been
discussed,
we
submit
that
also
is
not
valid
anymore
and
the
minority
to
majority
transfer
option
struck
down
in
(inaudible)
is
valid.
and
secondly,
mr.
justice
white,
i
don’t
think
it’s
involved
in
this
case
for
reasons
that
i
will
get
to,
and
we
--
but
we
submit
that
a
state
or
a
board
of
education
cannot
own
its
own
policy
determination
in
an
effort
to
alleviate
de
facto
or
whatever
you
call
it,
racial
balance,
undertake
to
affirmatively
assigned
students
on
the
basis
of
race
in
order
to
bring
about
a
racial
balance.
now,
i
will
attempt
to
show
later
on
that
that
is
not
involved
in
this
case
because
the
clarke
county
board
of
education
was
not
acting
voluntarily,
but
according
to
the
testimony
of
it
superintendent
at
page
97
of
the
record,
he
said,
we
are
acting
because
we
are
under
compulsion
of
hew,
they
are
about
to
cut
off
the
money.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
if
hew’s
action
is
valid,
of
course
that
would
be
true,
but
we
deny
that
hew’s
action
is
valid.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
before
brown,
yes.
after
brown
i
say
no.
but
i
qualify
that
by
saying
that
the
court
does
not
have
to
make
that
holding
in
this
case
in
order
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
thought
i
understood
the
justice
to
propose
a
question
whereby
the
board
voluntarily
and
without
compulsion
elected
to
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
you
assume
my
case
then.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
correct.
if
they
are
acting
pursuant
to
a
statute,
but
i
understood
the
question
to
pre-suppose
that
the
statute
was
constitutional.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
would
answer
your
question
this
way
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
that
is
perhaps
a
difference
between
what
the
constitution
requires
on
the
one
hand
and
what
it
permits
on
the
other.
i
will
attempt
to
develop
that
momentarily
because
i
think
it
involves
some
prior
decisions
of
this
court.
now
we
say
that
this
position
that
we
maintain
follows
from
--
for
several
reasons.
first,
the
language
of
brown
itself
and
the
overwhelming
judicial
interpretation
placed
upon
it
within
the
first
decade
after
1954,
we
have
collected
those
cases
in
our
brief.
this
court’s
decision
in
the
(inaudible)
case
itself
states
the
rule
in
terms
of
a
classification
based
on
race
for
the
purpose
of
transfer
between
public
schools
as
here.
the
wording
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
we
rely
upon
that.
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
negative,
it
is
not
affirmative.
it
confers
an
immunity
upon
people
to
be
free
from
discriminatory
governmental
action.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
in
4
or
5
enforcement
clause?
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
in
that
respect,
it
certainly
is,
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
we
do
not
think
so.
you
have
the
hew
provisions
of
title
six
that
are
involved,
but
i
do
not
interpret
those
as
presenting
the
issue
that
you
have
proposed.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
interpret
the
affirmative
duty
language
of
this
court’s
decision
in
green
to
mean
this
mr.
justice
marshall
that
no
school
board
who
had
de
jure
school
system
in
1954
or
at
any
other
time
could
simply
sit
back
and
not
do
anything.
i
think
it
was
a
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
think
they
were
required
to
reorganize
their
attendant
zones
to
change
their
method
of
assigning
students
to
school.
i
think
they
were
required
to
eliminate
faculty
desegregation
or
faculty
segregation.
i
think
i
should
add,
hasten
to
add
that
a
lot
of
these
things
that
are
clear
now
were
not
clear
five
and
even
10
years
ago
because
school
boards
have
labored
under
a
degree
of
uncertainty.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
the
school
board
in
clarke
county,
georgia?
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
they
did
two
things
wrong.
they
gerrymandered
the
attendance
lines
with
--
for
the
express
purpose
of
bringing
about
a
20:40
ratio
mix.
secondly,
being
unable
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
how
is
that
so?
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
the
equal
protection
clause
as
interpreted
by
this
court
in
the
brown
case
and
a
number
of
fifth
circuit
decisions
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
the
brown
case
said
that
any
assignment
of
peoples
by
race
is
a
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws,
that
is
my
interpretation.
that
is
the
basic
issue
that
i
think
you’ve
got
to
decide
today.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that’s
right
sir,
but
the
fact
that
you
assigned
them
by
zones
or
by
race
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
certainly
not,
certainly
not.
i'm
saying
that
any
board
and
this
is
based
upon
the
law
as
it
has
been
developed
in
green,
not
perhaps
as
some
of
us
assume
back
in
1955,
because
this
court
itself
upheld
a
pupil
placement
plan
in
the
shuttlesworth
case
that
on
its
face
provided
for
the
racial
assignment
of
pupils.
now,
looking
back
it’s
probably
that
was
an
interim
remedial
device.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
there’s
no
question
about
that.
we
aren't
disputing
that.
the
question
that
we
are
in
disagreement
about
is
what
do
they
have
to
do.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no,
sir.
i
don’t
accept
the
premise.
i
think
you
presuppose
that
you
can
deny
rights
to
one
group
in
order
to
call
them
to
another
and
that
would
mean
that
the
constitution
then
would
become
a
suicide
pact.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
well,
the
disagreement
comes
on
what
you
meant
when
you
said
that.
did
you
mean
that
you’ve
got
to
affirmatively
consider
race
or
did
you
mean
simply
that
this
--
the
boards
of
the
systems
involved
in
those
three
cases
could
not
continue
to
use
systems
of
assignment
that
were
racial?
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
think
there
has
to
be.
i
think
there
has
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes
sir,
i
think
that
there
has
to
be.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
well,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
don’t
concede
that
that
would
be
the
result
of
not
giving
consideration
to
race.
and
even
if
you
had
a
situation
where
you
ended
up
with
that
result
that
would
to
me
not
necessarily
carry
with
it
the
proposition
that
discrimination
had
been
practiced,
though
that
--
the
formal
dual
system
had
not
been
dismantled.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
certainly
not,
certainly
not.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
think
that
the
board
would
have
to
revise
its
assignment
policy.
it
could
do
either
one
of
two
ways.
it
could
go
to
pure
freedom
of
choice
plan,
not
the
freedom
of
choice
plan
that
this
court
struck
down
in
the
three
cases
in
1968.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
the
other
would
be
to
simply
draw
district
lines,
it
would
not
base
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
would
certainly
hope
so.
in
fact,
i
was
going
to
suggest
to
mr.
justice
douglas
that
that
would
be
the
answer
to
his
question,
about
how
you
could
get
these
people
out
of
the
ghettos.
it
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
you
would
have
a
freedom
of
choice
plan
under
which
the
choice
was
actually
free.
the
problem
in
the
green
case,
the
rene
case,
and
the
monroe
case
is
that
the
choice
was
not
in
fact
free,
but
that
the
systems
in
all
three
cases
continued
to
assign
students
on
the
basis
of
race.
in
the
kent
case,
where
the
student
did
not
exercise
the
choice,
he
was
automatically
put
back
in
the
school
to
which
he
had
been
assigned
on
the
racial
basis.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes,
sir
i
do.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
mr.
chief
justice,
i
will
express
it
this
way.
much
of
the
law
that
has
been
developed
in
green
and
other
cases,
perhaps
this
court
meant
in
brown,
but
i
would
say
this
that
very
few
school
attorneys
or
others
interpreted
many
of
the
things
that
the
court
has
since
required.
it
was
assumed,
for
example
after
briggs
versus
elliot
for
a
long
time
and
this
is
going
back
in
ancient
history,
and
perhaps
its
difficult
to
visualize
that
this
was
once
assumed
to
be
possible,
but
you
have
the
pupil
placement
plans
that
said
that
students
remain
where
they
are
albeit
they
were
putted
there
on
a
racial
basis.
but
they
are
permitted
to
transfer
out
by
meeting
a
list
of
17
criteria
that
were
set
out
in
the
shuttlesworth
case
and
this
court
upheld
that
in
the
late
50’s
or
the
early
60’s,
i’m
not
sure
of
which.
well,
the
law
as
evolved
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
the
charlotte
case
to
say
that
the
same
law
is
in
effect
in
1969
or
1968
that
the
courts,
including
the
courts
of
appeals
assume
was
the
law
in
1955
is
simply
missing
the
point
because
it’s
not
sold.
the
concepts
in
this
area
have
changed
and
i’m
not
saying
that
they
shouldn't
have
changed,
i’m
simply
saying
that
what
a
system
did
not
do
in
1955
should
not
indict
it
at
this
time
on
the
basis
of
requirements
that
we
feel
have
been
imposed
only
by
decisions
starting
in
about
1967
in
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
jefferson
and
in
the
green
case
in
1968.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
think
a
school
system
has
to
completely
change
its
method
of
assigning
students
from
the
old
system.
the
old
basis
in
most
southern
school
districts
was
a
neighborhood
plan
except
you
had
dual
zones,
you
had
one
for
black
and
one
for
white.
i
think
a
system
in
order
to
carry
out
its
affirmative
duty
has
to
erase
those
dual
zones
and
it
has
to
draw
a
line.
it
wants
to
go
a
neighborhood
plan
and
say,
students
on
this
side
will
go
to
this
school,
students
on
that
side
will
go
that
school.
i
think
the
system
as
this
court
interpreted
by
saying
in
green.
could
on
the
other
hand,
go
to
a
pure
uninhibited
freedom
of
choice.
now,
the
problem
in
green
and
the
other
cases
is
that
the
choice
was
not
free
and
we
have
attempted
to
distinguish
those
cases
in
our
brief
at
page
29,
i
believe.
now
all
three
of
them
and
show
that
in
each
instance,
the
free
choice
plans
involved
in
those
three
systems
continued
to
make
initial
assignments
in
one
form
or
another
of
students
on
the
basis
of
race
and
then
put
the
burden
on
them
to
get
out
of
it.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
correct
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
well,
those
of
the
two
types
of
plans
that
immediately
come
to
my
mind.
i
say
now
if
a
system
wants
to
consolidate
all
of
its
schools
and
out
them
all
in
one,
i
think
it
could
do
that
and
that
would
set
to
solve
the
problem.
i
think
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
we
concede
those,
we
concede
though.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
certainly,
faculties,
extra
curricular
activities,
athletics,
there
are
other
five
or
six
points
that
are
referred
to
in
green.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
what
insulates
it?
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
don’t
think
that
it
is.
if
the
assignment
of
that
teacher
is
motivated
by
considerations
of
race
whether
to
achieve
a
particular
racial
balance
or
otherwise,
we
submit,
it
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
certainly,
that’s
right.
now,
you
have
a
difference
in
that
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no
sir,
certainly
not.
but
i’m
saying
this
that
the
system
cannot
continue
under
the
old
arrangement.
one
solution
might
be
to
simply
to
undo
the
affects,
to
simply
put
all
the
names
in
a
hat,
maybe
classify
some
of
them
that
perhaps
it
would
not
be
qualified
to
go
into
a
particular
school
and
then
draw
the
names
out.
in
that
way
you
will
have
the
pure
chance
say
you
are
coming
in.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no,
sir.
but
it
would
be
one
way
to
avoid
containing
the
affects
of
past
discrimination.
it
may
not
be
educationally
wise,
but
i’m
trying
to
postulate
something
in
terms
of
satisfying
cure.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that’s
quite
possible.
perhaps
the
--
i
think
what
should
have
been
done
and
we
recognize
now
and
the
court's
decision
is
that
as
replacements
were
made,
they
should
have
been
made
on
a
nonracial
basis.
and
perhaps
in
many
instances
they
were
not
and
practically
the
way
it
works
is
that
the
principal
of
each
school
usually
goes
out
to
the
teachers
and
the
black
principals
get
the
black
teachers
and
the
white
one
gets
the
white.
this
court
has
told
us
that
that’s
wrong
and
we
recognize
that,
regard--
you
can’t
delegate
it
to
someone.
the
fifth
circuit
has
stated
what
i’m
trying
to
state
in
these
terms
or
first,
let
me
say
this.
in
the
houston
case,
the
judge
there
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
constitution
guarantees
the
right
to
vote.
it
guarantees
the
right
to
ride
buses
free
of
discrimination,
but
the
constitution
does
not
require
that
person
vote
and
it
does
not
require
that
he
ride
the
bus
in
any
particular
manner.
he
can
go
to
the
--
still
go
to
the
back
or
he
can
go
to
the
front,
anywhere
else
that
he
wants
to.
the
fifth
circuit
said
this.
the
constitution
affords
in
these
rights
not
recognized
until
a
recently.
it
does
not
impose
an
obligation
on
him
to
exercise
them.
it
is
for
him
to
decide
whether
it
be
to
his
advantage,
individual
is
still
the
master
of
his
fate.
and
we
say
thirdly,
that
all
students
cannot
be
assigned
to
schools
on
the
basis
of
race
without
at
the
same
time
violating
the
rights
of
those
students
both
black
and
white
and
there
four
instead
of
three
here
as
mr.
epting
said,
without
at
the
same
time
violating
the
rights
of
the
black
and
white
pupils
who
object
to
being
assigned
on
the
basis
of
race.
i
think
for
this
purpose
we
can
assume,
although,
we
will
certainly
not
concede
the
validity
of
this
proposition
that
says
that
educational
or
equal
education
opportunity
cannot
be
achieve
in
fact
unless
there
is
an
actual
integration
of
the
races.
but
assuming
that,
it
does
not
follow,
we
submit,
that
the
rights
of
the
groups
seeking
compulsory
association
to
achieve
this
end
of
equal
educational
opportunity
can
be
superior
to
those
who
seek
to
avoid
it
and
this
court
said
this
in
shirley
versus
kramer.
the
constitution
confers
upon
no
individual
the
right
to
demand
action
by
the
state
which
results
in
the
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws
to
other
individuals.
it’s
never
been
constitutional
doctrine
that
the
rights
of
one
group
seeking
this
can
be
used
as
a
pretext
for
denying
him
to
another
group.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
mr.
justice
black,
i
would
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
mr.
justice
black
there
is
certainly
a
difference
between
the
power
of
congress
under
the
enforcement
clause
and
the
power
of
a
court
proceeding
in
the
context
of
these
cases.
i
would
say
that
congress
could
not
do
it.
i
stood
here
about
four
years
ago
and
argued
a
voting
rights
case
and
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no
sir,
it’s
certainly
does
not
because
the
difference
between
--
it's
the
difference
between
the
power
of
congress
which
is
given
the
authority
to
implement
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
power
of
the
courts
which
are
not
given
that
express
authority,
but
necessarily
have
to
enforce
part
of
it.
and
another
appearance
of
the
houston
case
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
not
mutually
exclusive.
i
don’t
think
they
are
identical.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i’m
not
certain
i
understand
what
you
mean
by
mutually
exclusive
under
the
enforcement
clause?
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
well,
congress
of
course
has
enacted
certain
statutes
1983,
1981
on
which
all
suits
are
brought,
but
i
don’t
think
that
the
court
has
interpreted
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
being
limited
to
the
express
provisions
spelled
out
by
congress
in
statute.
the
court
has
said
that
it
has
certain
powers
and
responsibilities
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
independent
of
the
statute,
but
it
does
not
follow
that
its
power
is
the
same
or
can
be
equated
to
in
the
absence
of
the
statute
to
the
power
that
it
would
have
if
congress
had
enacted
a
statute.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
would
think
not
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that's
right.
it’s
expressing
it
more
directly.
i
would
like
to
distinguish
two
doctrines
that
are
relied
upon
in
these
cases
by
the
plaintiffs
or
the
petitioners.
it
said
that
there
are
two
doctrines
that
can
be
used
to
support
this
and
one
is
the
remedying
the
effects
of
past
discrimination
and
the
disestablishment
cases.
in
the
one
instance
reliance
is
placed
upon
the
voting
cases
involving
the
freezing
principle.
all
the
answer
to
that
simply
is
this
that
there
you
can
accomplish
your
remedial
device
without
denying
the
rights
of
the
whites
and
blacks
who
object.
in
the
freezing
cases
you
have
two
classes,
one
of
which
was
granted
certain
rights
and
one
of
which
was
denied
it
and
in
that
context
you
simply
confer
the
rights
on
the
class
that
were
denied
and
you
don’t
take
anything
away
from
the
other
class
that
was
granted
the
favored
treatment.
in
the
disestablishment
cases,
the
reliance
is
placed
upon
the
--
a
lot
of
cases
in
any
trust
fields
saying
that
having
found
an
illegal
combination
or
something
in
violation
of
law,
that
the
courts
can
go
further
than
simply
issuing
a
prohibitory
injunction
aimed
at
the
future
and
can
require
retroactively
a
divestiture
or
a
dissolution
of
the
illegal
combination.
there
the
courts
are
dealing
with
entirely
with
wrong
doers.
everybody
has
had
some
culpability
involved
in
that
situation.
so,
there
is
no
problem
presented
in
saying
that
we
can
rob
you
of
the
fruits
of
this
illegal
conspiracy,
but
here,
you
have
innocent
white
and
black
children
who
are
objecting
to
this
treatment
and
their
rights
cannot
be
made,
we
submit
to
be
sacrificed
in
order
to
order
to
accord
the
rights
to
somebody
else.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no,
sir.
that
would
still
involve
an
initial
assignment
by
race
if
the
lines
were
gerrymandered.
now,
i’m
not
certain
that
i
understood
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
if
the
lines
were
not
based
on
race,
i
think
what
the
chief
justice
has
said
would
be
correct
that
that
plan
would
be
valid
in
superimposing
an
absolute,
completely
freedom
of
choice
option
on
top
of
it
would
not
invalidate
it.
but,
if
you
presuppose
that
in
drawing
these
lines
or
in
going
to
these
parings
that
this
was
based
upon
race,
i
think
you’re
right
back
where
you
started.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no,
sir.
the
cases
in
the
fifth
circuit
struck
down,
the
old
pupil
placement
statutes
on
that
very
reasoning.
that
even
though
they
gave
the
student
an
unlimited
right
to
transfer
out
that
he
was
still
initially
assigned
to
the
old
school
that
he
had
been
assigned
to
on
the
basis
of
race
and
the
burden
was
putted
on
him
to
do
that
which
the
board
of
education
itself
should
have
carried
on.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
the
proposition
that
i
formulated
in
response
to
a
question
that
mr.
justice
douglas
had
asked,
was
that
it
was
not
any
zoning
to
begin
with
but
a
complete
freedom
of
choice
along
the
lines
that
fifth
circuits
said
out
in
the
jefferson
case
in
372
f2nd
836
where
they
said
that,
they
set
out
the
requirements
and
said
that,
if
a
student
does
not
assign
himself,
you
have
to
assigned
him
to
the
nearest
school
on
the
basis
of
proximity.
coming
back
momentarily
to
this
question,
i
think
these
--
the
arguments
that
have
been
made
here
in
which
is
it
is
said
that
the
remedial
aspects
of
this
in
order
to
give
the
remedy,
the
courts
can
do
this.
it
comes
down
to
this
that
can
a
remedial
device
be
employed
which
denies
a
substantive
right
to
another
class?
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes
sir,
they
had
enforcement
proceedings
pending
against
them,
they
had
been
already
threatened
with
one
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no
sir.
we
certainly
challenge
it.
that
the
board
had
adopted
a
bona
fide
neighborhood
plan
which
eliminated
it
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes,
sir,
we
do.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that’s
correct
sir.
i
would
although
my
time
is
up,
but
i
would
point
out
that
we
also
contend
that
this
plan
is
void
because
it
placed
unequal
burden
upon
the
negro
respondents
by
requiring
them
to
be
assigned
out
of
their
zones
where
it
did
not
impose
that
upon
the
whites.
