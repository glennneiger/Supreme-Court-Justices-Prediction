mr.
stanley
m.
brown
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
let
me
start
where
my
brother
williams
left
off.
and
let
me
start
out
by
answering
mr.
justice
brennan’s
question
what
was
the
situation
factually
disclaim
a
bootlegger
was
totally
false.
totally
false,
it
wasn’t
even
close.
now
here’s
the
one
brush
with
the
law
that
my
client
had
over
68
years
of
life,
the
majority
of
his
adult
life
being
public
life
and
public
office
including
being
a
congressman,
being
twice
a
member
of
the
executive
council
of
my
state.
in
1923,
one
of
his
brothers
was
running
one
in
those
days
was
known
as
a
near
beer
joint.
now
those
of
us
who
remembered
near
beer
remember
that
it
really
wasn’t
much
of
a
drink
unless
you
had
a
shot
to
put
in
it.
and
the
local
police
officers
thought
that
the
brother
emmanuel
not
this
plaintiff
below,
not
this
respondent.
but
they
thought
that
emanuel
probably
was
selling
an
occasional
shot
of
whiskey.
so
they
sent
a
spy
to
him
and
the
spy
got
a
shot
of
whiskey
and
he
has
to
preserve
that
evidence
because
that’s
going
to
be
the
evidence
on
which
they’re
going
to
rock
up
emanuel.
so
he
takes
the
shot
of
whiskey
in
his
holding
under
the
bar
when
the
rest
of
the
by
squad
breaks
in,
in
a
big
rush.
and
this
is
in
the
record,
they
jumped
over
the
bar,
hit
the
bartender
in
the
nose,
and
grab
the
bottle
out
of
which
the
shot
was
poured
and
they
got
emmanuel.
no
question
about
it
and
they’ve
also
got
oscar
who
was
acting
as
bartender
at
that
time.
in
the
rush
of
people
coming
in
and
people
inside
trying
to
get
out
somebody
jostled
the
arm
of
the
officer
who
was
carefully
holding
the
evidence
and
spilled
the
shot.
and
the
officers
coming
in
said,
alphonse
roy
did
that
and
we
want
him
over
the
station.
we’re
going
to
charge
him
with
interfering
with
a
police
officer.
he
went
over
to
the
station.
no
charge
was
ever
filed,
captain
gorrie
running
the
by
squad
told
him,
“look
al,
would
you
see
if
you
can’t
get
your
brother
out
of
this
racket,
he
shouldn’t
be
doing.”
and
alphonse,
this
is
the
testimony.
he
had
been
trying
to
get
his
brother
out.
and
with
the
assistance
of
another
frank
or
american
professional
man
in
the
area
after
he
paid
this
fine,
he
did
get
out
of
it
and
went
back
to
an
honest
living.
now
that
is
the
total
evidence
on
which
either
37
or
26
years
later,
during
a
period
when
this
man
was
in
vicious
political
campaign
and
nobody
ever
made
this
suggestion
that
(inaudible)
publishers
that
this
man
was
a
former
small-time
bootlegger.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
mr.
justice
white,
what
we
did
in
this
case
we
discovered
the
informant
to
pearson.
we
took
his
deposition
and
we
gave
him
a
chance
to
tell
us
every
single
thing
he
claimed
to
know
that
would
have
justified
his
making
this
report
to
pearson
and
then
we
went
out
and
we
found
witnesses
still
alive
to
disprove
every
single
one
of
that
man’s
lies.
and
we
proved
that
scott
the
informant
was
a
bald-faced
lie.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
no
recovery
was
possible
under
new
hampshire
law
if
it
proves
to
be
made
out
of
defense.
they
had
to
find
and
presumably
did
find
that
it
was
false.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
if
your
honor
is
talking
about
the
total
charge,
your
honor,
i
think
misinterprets.
if
your
honor
is
talking
about
those
segments
of
the
charge
my
brother
williams
had
brief
you
would
get
that
impression.
the
law
in
new
hampshire
as
i
argued
to
this
court
back
in
1966
gives
a
broader
conditional
privilege
and
that
which
this
court
is
attempting
to
work
on.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
and
you
have
to
read
the
total
charge
on
the
private
sector
or
state
law
to
see
that
you
can
either
justify
or
excuse
and
in
the
total
picture
you
cannot
--
a
plaintiff
cannot
recover
for
a
false
--
for
a
true
defamatory
of
the
case.
the
plaintiffs
must
prove
falsely
and
you
pick
that
up
that
in
the
beginning
of
the
charge
where
the
court
instructs
them
with
regard
to
what
actual
defamation
in
new
hampshire
is.
may
i
say
this
mr.
justice
white
with
regard
to
this
situation
to
which
you
are
directing
our
attention.
on
page
406
of
the
record
in
this
court
you
will
find
the
defendant’s
request
for
instruction
number
20.
now
under
our
practice
that
the
conclusion
of
the
trial,
counsel
submit
request
which
puts
this
--
suppose
to
put
the
judge
on
the
hook.
he
either
grants
them
or
denies
them.
if
he
denies
them
the
fellow
who
submitted
them
gets
an
exception
and
can
go
someplace.
but
if
he
grants
that
becomes
the
law
or
the
trial
and
that
party
is
not
under
our
practice
entitled
to
come
forward
later
and
complain
about
the
instruction
being
given
that
he
asked
and
this
is
the
defendant’s
instruction
as
applied
to
this
case,
applying
new
york
times
to
this
case.
where
an
article
is
published
and
circulated
amongst
borders
for
the
sole
purpose
of
giving
what
the
defendant
believes
to
be
truthful
information
concerning
a
candidate
to
public
office
and
for
the
purpose
of
enabling
such
voters
to
cast
their
ballot
more
intelligently
and
the
whole
thing
is
done
in
good
faith
and
without
malice.
the
article
is
privileged.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
and
then
there’s
an
additional
section
of
the
charge
that
if
he
can’t
justify,
he
then
may
excuse
it.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
but
in
that
--
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
that’s
correct.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
mr.
justice
white,
i
have
read
that
charge
more
than
once.
i’m
talking
about
the
one
that
judge
morris
gave
this
case
and
i
cannot
accept
your
interpretation
of
it
and
i
think
perhaps
that
misunderstanding
with
the
regard
to
what
--
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
--
what
new
hampshire
law
is.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
mr.
justice
white,
i
do
not
--
believe
that
those
instructions
that
charge
left
that
position
open.
i’m
relatively
sure
that
it
did
not
since
i
was
involved
in
the
case
--
and
i
had
gone
over
this
now.
i’d
be
glad
to
submit.
i
didn’t
brief
it
here
because
i
didn’t
know
it
is
just
going
to
come
out.
but
what’s
happened
here,
a
particular
portion
of
the
charge
has
been
over
emphasized
by
the
defense.
and
if
you
read
the
entire
charge,
as
it
was
given
and
understand
it
as
it
was
given,
that
position
is
not
open.
that
is
to
recover
for
the
publication
of
the
truth.
it
never
has
been
since
new
hampshire.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
the
supreme
court,
the
state
supreme
court
decision
in
this
case
says
that
a
charge
of
bootlegging
based
upon
this
solitary
brush
with
the
law
that
i
spoke
of
which
is
at
least
26
and
maybe
37
years
old.
the
rest
of
the
evidence
was
that
such
a
rumor
that
he
might
have
been
a
bootlegger
had
dried
up,
stopped
that
was
not
prevalent
from
1930
on.
that
bringing
that
into
a
1960
campaign
as
it
was
done
in
this
case
could
be
found
factually
to
be
irrelevant
to
the
man’s
1960
qualifications
for
office.
now
the
supreme
court
decision
says
obviously
the
trial
court
came
to
that
preliminary
decision
which
is
what
is
the
suggested
procedure
under
times
and
sullivan.
and
obviously
in
addition,
the
jury
so
found
and
that’s
what
this
record
is
at
this
point.
nobody
until
we
got
here
has
suggested
the
contrary
that
this
is
not
a
factual
matter
as
to
whether
or
not
something
is
stale
as
this
is
material
relevant
to
the
man’s
fitness
at
the
time.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
yes.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
no,
no
your
honor.
the
charge
is
quite
specific
and
in
language
that
jurors
could
understand
that
they
came
to
this
division
in
the
role.
they
must
divide
as
a
matter
of
fact
themselves
was
this
bootlegging.
you
see,
they
don’t
comment
on
evidence
in
new
hampshire,
they
judge
not
at
all.
if
this
charge
having
them
published,
if
they
found
it
would
bear
on
the
man’s
fitness
for
office
and
therefore
--
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
i’m
sorry.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
no,
your
honor.
we
stipulated
at
the
outset
butts
and
walker
had
not
yet
come
down
and
we
stipulated
that.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
well,
we
can
see
that
if
he
was
a
public
official,
that
aspect
we
just
not
concede
that
this
subject
matter
was
comment
concerning
his
so-called
official
comment.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
but
the
status
of
the
public
figure
official,
we
conceded
and
tried
the
case
on
that
basis.
that
wasn’t
left
over
the
jury.
the
jury
was
instructed
that
that
had
been
agreed
upon
and
they
were
to
handle
case
on
that
basis.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
i
say
--
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
your
honor,
i
say
that
the
answer
to
that
is
yes
and
i’ll
go
back
to
hitlers
mein
kampf.
the
big
lie
is
the
one
that
hurts.
now
understand
this,
if
it
please
the
court,
not
one
nickel
was
awarded
for
a
lost
of
election.
so
he
lost
the
election
and
whatever
time
and
effort
he
put
it.
and
the
public
lost
the
benefit
of
having
as
a
public
official.
but
in
addition
to
that
and
thereafter,
because
this
was
a
big
lie,
the
damage
continues
on
and
it
damages
him
and
his
personal
private
capacity.
and
that’s
what
the
verdicts
represent.
i
don’t
think
that
you
can
take
the
position
as
argued
by
my
brother
williams
that
whatever
anybody
wants
to
write
about
anybody
who
stands
the
public
office
is
automatic
--
is
automatically
subject
to
the
strictures
of
new
york
times
and
sullivan.
if
you
take
that
position
i
think
you’re
moving
in
the
wrong
direction.
the
application
of
the
times
doctrine
below
has
gone
so
far
that
judge
skelly
wright
for
example
has
completely
reversed
all
of
the
normal
procedures
that
courts
are
suppose
to
use
on
motions
for
summary
judgment,
motions
to
dismiss
and
motions
for
directed
verdict.
he
says
that
the
court
shall
take
into
account
the
credibility
of
witnesses
and
the
court
shall
draw
all
instances
and
the
court
shall,
this
is
his
decision
in
wasserman,
unless
the
court
is
satisfied
that
the
plaintiff
has
won,
the
case
never
gets
to
the
jury
for
determination.
now
all
of
the
law
that
i
know
says
that
on
each
of
those
situations
if
there
is
evidence
in
the
case
which
raises
a
material
question
of
fact,
the
jury
is
the
trier
of
the
fact.
in
new
hampshire
that
must
be
the
situation
because
that
is
the
constitutional
requirement.
this
judge
--
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
yes,
but
additionally
if
the
court
is
conducting
a
jury
trial
the
court
is
powerless
to
make
any
factual
determination.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
state
constitution
statute
been
practiced
since
the
beginning
of
time.
let
me
point
out
one
thing
that
my
brother
williams
did
not
mention
to
the
court.
we
have
ample
evidence
of
new
york
times
malice
in
this
case.
but
it
was
not
permitted
to
be
considered
by
the
jury
because
our
trial
court
made
one
error
in
ruling.
he
ruled
that
drew
pearson
and
drew
pearson’s
malice.
i’m
talking
about
his
reckless
disregard
was
not
chargeable
to
nana
and
to
the
newspaper.
he
did
this
because
the
defense
below
although
they
were
orders
to
make
this
clear
successfully
avoided
letting
the
court
know
whether
or
not
pearson
was
the
real
party
in
interest
defendant
and
therefore
chargeable
with
his
own
acts.
when
they
came
to
this
court,
by
letter
they
acknowledged
that
pearson
was
the
real
party
in
interest
defendant
by
a
letter
to
judge
brennan
asking
for
an
extension
which
they
have
been
unwilling
ever
to
say
to
the
state
court.
the
factual
background
between
pearson
and
this
people
is
that
pearson
by
contract
would
nana
writes,
nana
is
not
permitted
to
change
his
writings
and
has
affirmatively
obligated
to
spread
it
out
to
the
newspapers.
and
if
there
is
any
light,
pearson
indemnifies
nana
and
in
this
case
also
indemnifies
the
monitor.
and
we
tried
this
case
assuming
that
the
malice
of
pearson
this
whole
thing
was
based
on
one,
telephone
call
to
a
man
he
did
not
know
and
had
never
met.
no
verification
whatsoever
and
it
was
false.
getting
back
to
senator
mundt,
this
is
the
situation.
there
was
a
man
and
it
wasn’t
an
anonymous
telephone
call.
the
fellow’s
name
was
george
scott.
but
it
might
just
as
well
have
been
anonymous.
did
he
ask
or
attempt
to
find
out
from
the
other
side,
is
it
true
or
false?
i
asked
him
that.
he
said,
no.
he
didn’t
try
to
find
out
from
roy
whether
it
was
true
or
false
because
people
in
embarrassing
positions,
he
knows
would
deny
it
anyway.
now
this
is
malice
and
we
preserve
our
position,
the
court
was
wrong
excluding
that.
it
came
in
but
then
this
jury
was
instructed
to
disregard
it.
so
that
if
it
were
necessary
on
remand
we
would
go
back
to
the
state
supreme
court
prior
to
a
new
trial
and
that
court
would
i’m
quite
sure
advice
the
trial
court
that
that
was
error.
we
try
it
again
with
this
evidence
and
we
would
satisfy
all
of
the
requirements
of
times
and
sullivan
that
anybody
justly
could
say
apply
to
the
case.
one
other
thing
--
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
the
state
supreme
court
decision,
mr.
justice
marshall
adverts
to
that.
what
the
state
supreme
court
says
is
that
a
charge
of
bootlegging
--
it’s
difficult
to
say
that
that
is
not
relevant
particularly
if
it
were
an
event
of
recent
occurrence.
but
that
was
the
passage
of
time.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
well,
the
court
does
not
--
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
the
court
does
not
as
a
matter
of
law
rule
that
this
was
in
the
private
sector.
i
don’t
like
the
language
either.
what
it
says
is
that
with
the
passage
of
time,
of
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
and
with
no
actual
factual
basis
for
the
charge
being
made
it
becomes
a
question
of
fact
as
to
whether
it
is
relevant
in
a
1960
campaign
and
therefore
let
a
jury
determine
that
question
of
fact.
may
i
add,
--
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
sir?
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
may
i
add
other
thing
and
it
bears
on
what
the
point
that
you
bring
out.
pearson
testified
under
oath
that
he
didn’t
make
this
publication
for
the
purpose
of
instructing
the
voters
at
all.
now
you’ll
find
that
at
page,
i
think
its
190
194
perhaps,
and
again
at
183.
what
he
said
was
that
he
was
writing
this
for
a
national
consumption
and
had
no
intention
at
all
to
affect
the
outcome
of
the
election.
so
you
get
this
situation.
the
defense
is
that
since
this
man
is
running
for
public
office,
anything
that’s
said
about
him
to
help
the
voters
or
to
help
persuade
them
should
have
this
privilege.
and
the
man
who
wrote
it
said
that
isn’t
what
i
was
writing
it
for.
the
only
reason
that
it
was
published
on
the
saturday
before
the
election
was
that
general
reader
interest
in
this
type
of
thing
is
highest
then.
in
other
words,
the
column
has
more
salability
then
it
would
a
week
or
two
later.
but
there
was
no
effort
to
use
this
pearson
says,
to
influence
voters.
now
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
relevant
whether
to
the
election
campaign,
bear
this
in
mind.
nobody
in
the
election
campaign
itself
ever
used
this
bootlegger
charge
at
all.
that
hill
camp
that
this
article
might
have
helped,
they
never
put
out
a
word
claiming
any
bootleg.
that’s
the
vicious
thing
about
this
whole
case.
you
can
say
i
think
and
it’s
difficult
to
argue.
you
can
say
almost
anything
about
a
candidate
may
have
some
relevance
to
his
fitness,
almost.
and
if
it
is
used
for
the
purpose
of
helping
the
voters
make
their
decision,
then
it
should
have
some
higher
standing
than
as
if
it
is
published
a
month
afterwards
for
the
purpose
of
making
some
other
story.
what
happened
here
was
that
pearson
claimed
that
sullivan
was
a
(inaudible)
after
a
hearing
had
been
had
on
it
and
at
which
he
was
held
not
to
be
a
(inaudible).
so
this
is
false.
at
that
hearing,
the
theory
of
the
hill
forces
was
that
roy
had
procured
all
three
of
them
and
that
wasn’t
substantiated
so
that
again
is
false
he
throws
it
in.
nobody
really
believed
that
senator
bridges
would
fool
around
with
these
democrat
candidates.
the
three
of
them
together
couldn’t
have
elect
him
and
they
didn’t.
it
wasn’t
that
close.
the
evidence
is
that
as
national
columns
throws
big
names
in
to
attract
attention
to
his
column
that’s
why
bridges
is
in
there
and
he
had
three
people
with
criminal
records
who
had
filed
for
this
off
of
it,
sullivan,
mccarthy
and
robinson.
and
he
wanted
one
more
to
make
this
story
that
much
better
and
he
made
my
client
roy
into
a
criminal
for
that
purpose.
in
the
information
that
he
got
at
the
time
he
got
this
information
he
was
told
that
roy
had
been
a
u.s.
congressman.
he
was
told
that
roy
was
a
responsible
public
officer
and
a
responsible
businessman.
he
left
that
out
and
he
deliberately
substituted,
this
is
something
like
the
pope
case.
it’s
something
like
wasserman
and
ragano.
he
knew
that
roy
was
actually
a
responsible
person.
he
deliberately
maligned
him
and
degraded
him
not
for
the
purpose
of
helping
the
voters
one
bit
but
for
the
purpose
of
selling
that
column
throughout
the
united
states,
and
you
take
his
word
for
that,
not
mine.
this
is
the
part
that
this
court
is
going
to
have
to
face
up
to
it
sometime.
you
cannot
assume
that
publishes
are
publishing
with
proper
motives.
motive
may
be
a
bad
word
in
this
court
but
in
good
faith
and
for
our
proper
purpose
those
two
things
have
always
been
the
underlying
basis
for
allowing
the
privilege
and
where
the
person
claiming
that
privilege
does
not
make
that
out.
i
say,
there’s
no
basis
for
this
or
any
other
court
in
this
county
saying
that
the
injured
person
who
has
a
constitutional
right
of
equal
magnitude
to
be
--
to
a
remedy
for
that
damage,
to
send
that
person
away
remediless.
unless
the
court
has
questions?
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
let
me
start
where
my
brother
williams
left
off.
and
let
me
start
out
by
answering
mr.
justice
brennan’s
question
what
was
the
situation
factually
disclaim
a
bootlegger
was
totally
false.
totally
false,
it
wasn’t
even
close.
now
here’s
the
one
brush
with
the
law
that
my
client
had
over
68
years
of
life,
the
majority
of
his
adult
life
being
public
life
and
public
office
including
being
a
congressman,
being
twice
a
member
of
the
executive
council
of
my
state.
in
1923,
one
of
his
brothers
was
running
one
in
those
days
was
known
as
a
near
beer
joint.
now
those
of
us
who
remembered
near
beer
remember
that
it
really
wasn’t
much
of
a
drink
unless
you
had
a
shot
to
put
in
it.
and
the
local
police
officers
thought
that
the
brother
emmanuel
not
this
plaintiff
below,
not
this
respondent.
but
they
thought
that
emanuel
probably
was
selling
an
occasional
shot
of
whiskey.
so
they
sent
a
spy
to
him
and
the
spy
got
a
shot
of
whiskey
and
he
has
to
preserve
that
evidence
because
that’s
going
to
be
the
evidence
on
which
they’re
going
to
rock
up
emanuel.
so
he
takes
the
shot
of
whiskey
in
his
holding
under
the
bar
when
the
rest
of
the
by
squad
breaks
in,
in
a
big
rush.
and
this
is
in
the
record,
they
jumped
over
the
bar,
hit
the
bartender
in
the
nose,
and
grab
the
bottle
out
of
which
the
shot
was
poured
and
they
got
emmanuel.
no
question
about
it
and
they’ve
also
got
oscar
who
was
acting
as
bartender
at
that
time.
in
the
rush
of
people
coming
in
and
people
inside
trying
to
get
out
somebody
jostled
the
arm
of
the
officer
who
was
carefully
holding
the
evidence
and
spilled
the
shot.
and
the
officers
coming
in
said,
alphonse
roy
did
that
and
we
want
him
over
the
station.
we’re
going
to
charge
him
with
interfering
with
a
police
officer.
he
went
over
to
the
station.
no
charge
was
ever
filed,
captain
gorrie
running
the
by
squad
told
him,
“look
al,
would
you
see
if
you
can’t
get
your
brother
out
of
this
racket,
he
shouldn’t
be
doing.”
and
alphonse,
this
is
the
testimony.
he
had
been
trying
to
get
his
brother
out.
and
with
the
assistance
of
another
frank
or
american
professional
man
in
the
area
after
he
paid
this
fine,
he
did
get
out
of
it
and
went
back
to
an
honest
living.
now
that
is
the
total
evidence
on
which
either
37
or
26
years
later,
during
a
period
when
this
man
was
in
vicious
political
campaign
and
nobody
ever
made
this
suggestion
that
(inaudible)
publishers
that
this
man
was
a
former
small-time
bootlegger.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
mr.
justice
white,
what
we
did
in
this
case
we
discovered
the
informant
to
pearson.
we
took
his
deposition
and
we
gave
him
a
chance
to
tell
us
every
single
thing
he
claimed
to
know
that
would
have
justified
his
making
this
report
to
pearson
and
then
we
went
out
and
we
found
witnesses
still
alive
to
disprove
every
single
one
of
that
man’s
lies.
and
we
proved
that
scott
the
informant
was
a
bald-faced
lie.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
no
recovery
was
possible
under
new
hampshire
law
if
it
proves
to
be
made
out
of
defense.
they
had
to
find
and
presumably
did
find
that
it
was
false.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
if
your
honor
is
talking
about
the
total
charge,
your
honor,
i
think
misinterprets.
if
your
honor
is
talking
about
those
segments
of
the
charge
my
brother
williams
had
brief
you
would
get
that
impression.
the
law
in
new
hampshire
as
i
argued
to
this
court
back
in
1966
gives
a
broader
conditional
privilege
and
that
which
this
court
is
attempting
to
work
on.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
and
you
have
to
read
the
total
charge
on
the
private
sector
or
state
law
to
see
that
you
can
either
justify
or
excuse
and
in
the
total
picture
you
cannot
--
a
plaintiff
cannot
recover
for
a
false
--
for
a
true
defamatory
of
the
case.
the
plaintiffs
must
prove
falsely
and
you
pick
that
up
that
in
the
beginning
of
the
charge
where
the
court
instructs
them
with
regard
to
what
actual
defamation
in
new
hampshire
is.
may
i
say
this
mr.
justice
white
with
regard
to
this
situation
to
which
you
are
directing
our
attention.
on
page
406
of
the
record
in
this
court
you
will
find
the
defendant’s
request
for
instruction
number
20.
now
under
our
practice
that
the
conclusion
of
the
trial,
counsel
submit
request
which
puts
this
--
suppose
to
put
the
judge
on
the
hook.
he
either
grants
them
or
denies
them.
if
he
denies
them
the
fellow
who
submitted
them
gets
an
exception
and
can
go
someplace.
but
if
he
grants
that
becomes
the
law
or
the
trial
and
that
party
is
not
under
our
practice
entitled
to
come
forward
later
and
complain
about
the
instruction
being
given
that
he
asked
and
this
is
the
defendant’s
instruction
as
applied
to
this
case,
applying
new
york
times
to
this
case.
where
an
article
is
published
and
circulated
amongst
borders
for
the
sole
purpose
of
giving
what
the
defendant
believes
to
be
truthful
information
concerning
a
candidate
to
public
office
and
for
the
purpose
of
enabling
such
voters
to
cast
their
ballot
more
intelligently
and
the
whole
thing
is
done
in
good
faith
and
without
malice.
the
article
is
privileged.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
and
then
there’s
an
additional
section
of
the
charge
that
if
he
can’t
justify,
he
then
may
excuse
it.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
but
in
that
--
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
that’s
correct.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
mr.
justice
white,
i
have
read
that
charge
more
than
once.
i’m
talking
about
the
one
that
judge
morris
gave
this
case
and
i
cannot
accept
your
interpretation
of
it
and
i
think
perhaps
that
misunderstanding
with
the
regard
to
what
--
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
--
what
new
hampshire
law
is.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
mr.
justice
white,
i
do
not
--
believe
that
those
instructions
that
charge
left
that
position
open.
i’m
relatively
sure
that
it
did
not
since
i
was
involved
in
the
case
--
and
i
had
gone
over
this
now.
i’d
be
glad
to
submit.
i
didn’t
brief
it
here
because
i
didn’t
know
it
is
just
going
to
come
out.
but
what’s
happened
here,
a
particular
portion
of
the
charge
has
been
over
emphasized
by
the
defense.
and
if
you
read
the
entire
charge,
as
it
was
given
and
understand
it
as
it
was
given,
that
position
is
not
open.
that
is
to
recover
for
the
publication
of
the
truth.
it
never
has
been
since
new
hampshire.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
the
supreme
court,
the
state
supreme
court
decision
in
this
case
says
that
a
charge
of
bootlegging
based
upon
this
solitary
brush
with
the
law
that
i
spoke
of
which
is
at
least
26
and
maybe
37
years
old.
the
rest
of
the
evidence
was
that
such
a
rumor
that
he
might
have
been
a
bootlegger
had
dried
up,
stopped
that
was
not
prevalent
from
1930
on.
that
bringing
that
into
a
1960
campaign
as
it
was
done
in
this
case
could
be
found
factually
to
be
irrelevant
to
the
man’s
1960
qualifications
for
office.
now
the
supreme
court
decision
says
obviously
the
trial
court
came
to
that
preliminary
decision
which
is
what
is
the
suggested
procedure
under
times
and
sullivan.
and
obviously
in
addition,
the
jury
so
found
and
that’s
what
this
record
is
at
this
point.
nobody
until
we
got
here
has
suggested
the
contrary
that
this
is
not
a
factual
matter
as
to
whether
or
not
something
is
stale
as
this
is
material
relevant
to
the
man’s
fitness
at
the
time.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
yes.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
no,
no
your
honor.
the
charge
is
quite
specific
and
in
language
that
jurors
could
understand
that
they
came
to
this
division
in
the
role.
they
must
divide
as
a
matter
of
fact
themselves
was
this
bootlegging.
you
see,
they
don’t
comment
on
evidence
in
new
hampshire,
they
judge
not
at
all.
if
this
charge
having
them
published,
if
they
found
it
would
bear
on
the
man’s
fitness
for
office
and
therefore
--
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
i’m
sorry.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
no,
your
honor.
we
stipulated
at
the
outset
butts
and
walker
had
not
yet
come
down
and
we
stipulated
that.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
well,
we
can
see
that
if
he
was
a
public
official,
that
aspect
we
just
not
concede
that
this
subject
matter
was
comment
concerning
his
so-called
official
comment.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
but
the
status
of
the
public
figure
official,
we
conceded
and
tried
the
case
on
that
basis.
that
wasn’t
left
over
the
jury.
the
jury
was
instructed
that
that
had
been
agreed
upon
and
they
were
to
handle
case
on
that
basis.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
i
say
--
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
your
honor,
i
say
that
the
answer
to
that
is
yes
and
i’ll
go
back
to
hitlers
mein
kampf.
the
big
lie
is
the
one
that
hurts.
now
understand
this,
if
it
please
the
court,
not
one
nickel
was
awarded
for
a
lost
of
election.
so
he
lost
the
election
and
whatever
time
and
effort
he
put
it.
and
the
public
lost
the
benefit
of
having
as
a
public
official.
but
in
addition
to
that
and
thereafter,
because
this
was
a
big
lie,
the
damage
continues
on
and
it
damages
him
and
his
personal
private
capacity.
and
that’s
what
the
verdicts
represent.
i
don’t
think
that
you
can
take
the
position
as
argued
by
my
brother
williams
that
whatever
anybody
wants
to
write
about
anybody
who
stands
the
public
office
is
automatic
--
is
automatically
subject
to
the
strictures
of
new
york
times
and
sullivan.
if
you
take
that
position
i
think
you’re
moving
in
the
wrong
direction.
the
application
of
the
times
doctrine
below
has
gone
so
far
that
judge
skelly
wright
for
example
has
completely
reversed
all
of
the
normal
procedures
that
courts
are
suppose
to
use
on
motions
for
summary
judgment,
motions
to
dismiss
and
motions
for
directed
verdict.
he
says
that
the
court
shall
take
into
account
the
credibility
of
witnesses
and
the
court
shall
draw
all
instances
and
the
court
shall,
this
is
his
decision
in
wasserman,
unless
the
court
is
satisfied
that
the
plaintiff
has
won,
the
case
never
gets
to
the
jury
for
determination.
now
all
of
the
law
that
i
know
says
that
on
each
of
those
situations
if
there
is
evidence
in
the
case
which
raises
a
material
question
of
fact,
the
jury
is
the
trier
of
the
fact.
in
new
hampshire
that
must
be
the
situation
because
that
is
the
constitutional
requirement.
this
judge
--
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
yes,
but
additionally
if
the
court
is
conducting
a
jury
trial
the
court
is
powerless
to
make
any
factual
determination.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
state
constitution
statute
been
practiced
since
the
beginning
of
time.
let
me
point
out
one
thing
that
my
brother
williams
did
not
mention
to
the
court.
we
have
ample
evidence
of
new
york
times
malice
in
this
case.
but
it
was
not
permitted
to
be
considered
by
the
jury
because
our
trial
court
made
one
error
in
ruling.
he
ruled
that
drew
pearson
and
drew
pearson’s
malice.
i’m
talking
about
his
reckless
disregard
was
not
chargeable
to
nana
and
to
the
newspaper.
he
did
this
because
the
defense
below
although
they
were
orders
to
make
this
clear
successfully
avoided
letting
the
court
know
whether
or
not
pearson
was
the
real
party
in
interest
defendant
and
therefore
chargeable
with
his
own
acts.
when
they
came
to
this
court,
by
letter
they
acknowledged
that
pearson
was
the
real
party
in
interest
defendant
by
a
letter
to
judge
brennan
asking
for
an
extension
which
they
have
been
unwilling
ever
to
say
to
the
state
court.
the
factual
background
between
pearson
and
this
people
is
that
pearson
by
contract

writes,
nana
is
not
permitted
to
change
his
writings
and
has
affirmatively
obligated
to
spread
it
out
to
the
newspapers.
and
if
there
is
any
light,
pearson
indemnifies
nana
and
in
this
case
also
indemnifies
the
monitor.
and
we
tried
this
case
assuming
that
the
malice
of
pearson
this
whole
thing
was
based
on
one,
telephone
call
to
a
man
he
did
not
know
and
had
never
met.
no
verification
whatsoever
and
it
was
false.
getting
back
to
senator
mundt,
this
is
the
situation.
there
was
a
man
and
it
wasn’t
an
anonymous
telephone
call.
the
fellow’s
name
was
george
scott.
but
it
might
just
as
well
have
been
anonymous.
did
he
ask
or
attempt
to
find
out
from
the
other
side,
is
it
true
or
false?
i
asked
him
that.
he
said,
no.
he
didn’t
try
to
find
out
from
roy
whether
it
was
true
or
false
because
people
in
embarrassing
positions,
he
knows
would
deny
it
anyway.
now
this
is
malice
and
we
preserve
our
position,
the
court
was
wrong
excluding
that.
it
came
in
but
then
this
jury
was
instructed
to
disregard
it.
so
that
if
it
were
necessary
on
remand
we
would
go
back
to
the
state
supreme
court
prior
to
a
new
trial
and
that
court
would
i’m
quite
sure
advice
the
trial
court
that
that
was
error.
we
try
it
again
with
this
evidence
and
we
would
satisfy
all
of
the
requirements
of
times
and
sullivan
that
anybody
justly
could
say
apply
to
the
case.
one
other
thing
--
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
the
state
supreme
court
decision,
mr.
justice
marshall
adverts
to
that.
what
the
state
supreme
court
says
is
that
a
charge
of
bootlegging
--
it’s
difficult
to
say
that
that
is
not
relevant
particularly
if
it
were
an
event
of
recent
occurrence.
but
that
was
the
passage
of
time.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
well,
the
court
does
not
--
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
the
court
does
not
as
a
matter
of
law
rule
that
this
was
in
the
private
sector.
i
don’t
like
the
language
either.
what
it
says
is
that
with
the
passage
of
time,
of
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
and
with
no
actual
factual
basis
for
the
charge
being
made
it
becomes
a
question
of
fact
as
to
whether
it
is
relevant
in
a
1960
campaign
and
therefore
let
a
jury
determine
that
question
of
fact.
may
i
add,
--
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
sir?
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
may
i
add
other
thing
and
it
bears
on
what
the
point
that
you
bring
out.
pearson
testified
under
oath
that
he
didn’t
make
this
publication
for
the
purpose
of
instructing
the
voters
at
all.
now
you’ll
find
that
at
page,
i
think
its
190
194
perhaps,
and
again
at
183.
what
he
said
was
that
he
was
writing
this
for
a
national
consumption
and
had
no
intention
at
all
to
affect
the
outcome
of
the
election.
so
you
get
this
situation.
the
defense
is
that
since
this
man
is
running
for
public
office,
anything
that’s
said
about
him
to
help
the
voters
or
to
help
persuade
them
should
have
this
privilege.
and
the
man
who
wrote
it
said
that
isn’t
what
i
was
writing
it
for.
the
only
reason
that
it
was
published
on
the
saturday
before
the
election
was
that
general
reader
interest
in
this
type
of
thing
is
highest
then.
in
other
words,
the
column
has
more
salability
then
it
would
a
week
or
two
later.
but
there
was
no
effort
to
use
this
pearson
says,
to
influence
voters.
now
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
relevant
whether
to
the
election
campaign,
bear
this
in
mind.
nobody
in
the
election
campaign
itself
ever
used
this
bootlegger
charge
at
all.
that
hill
camp
that
this
article
might
have
helped,
they
never
put
out
a
word
claiming
any
bootleg.
that’s
the
vicious
thing
about
this
whole
case.
you
can
say
i
think
and
it’s
difficult
to
argue.
you
can
say
almost
anything
about
a
candidate
may
have
some
relevance
to
his
fitness,
almost.
and
if
it
is
used
for
the
purpose
of
helping
the
voters
make
their
decision,
then
it
should
have
some
higher
standing
than
as
if
it
is
published
a
month
afterwards
for
the
purpose
of
making
some
other
story.
what
happened
here
was
that
pearson
claimed
that
sullivan
was
a
(inaudible)
after
a
hearing
had
been
had
on
it
and
at
which
he
was
held
not
to
be
a
(inaudible).
so
this
is
false.
at
that
hearing,
the
theory
of
the
hill
forces
was
that
roy
had
procured
all
three
of
them
and
that
wasn’t
substantiated
so
that
again
is
false
he
throws
it
in.
nobody
really
believed
that
senator
bridges
would
fool
around
with
these
democrat
candidates.
the
three
of
them
together
couldn’t
have
elect
him
and
they
didn’t.
it
wasn’t
that
close.
the
evidence
is
that
as
national
columns
throws
big
names
in
to
attract
attention
to
his
column
that’s
why
bridges
is
in
there
and
he
had
three
people
with
criminal
records
who
had
filed
for
this
off
of
it,
sullivan,
mccarthy
and
robinson.
and
he
wanted
one
more
to
make
this
story
that
much
better
and
he
made
my
client
roy
into
a
criminal
for
that
purpose.
in
the
information
that
he
got
at
the
time
he
got
this
information
he
was
told
that
roy
had
been
a
u.s.
congressman.
he
was
told
that
roy
was
a
responsible
public
officer
and
a
responsible
businessman.
he
left
that
out
and
he
deliberately
substituted,
this
is
something
like
the
pope
case.
it’s
something
like
wasserman
and
ragano.
he
knew
that
roy
was
actually
a
responsible
person.
he
deliberately
maligned
him
and
degraded
him
not
for
the
purpose
of
helping
the
voters
one
bit
but
for
the
purpose
of
selling
that
column
throughout
the
united
states,
and
you
take
his
word
for
that,
not
mine.
this
is
the
part
that
this
court
is
going
to
have
to
face
up
to
it
sometime.
you
cannot
assume
that
publishes
are
publishing
with
proper
motives.
motive
may
be
a
bad
word
in
this
court
but
in
good
faith
and
for
our
proper
purpose
those
two
things
have
always
been
the
underlying
basis
for
allowing
the
privilege
and
where
the
person
claiming
that
privilege
does
not
make
that
out.
i
say,
there’s
no
basis
for
this
or
any
other
court
in
this
county
saying
that
the
injured
person
who
has
a
constitutional
right
of
equal
magnitude
to
be
--
to
a
remedy
for
that
damage,
to
send
that
person
away
remediless.
unless
the
court
has
questions?
