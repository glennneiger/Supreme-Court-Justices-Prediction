i
suppose
you
contend
the
very
least
this
time
as
a
public
figure
not
a
public
official.
unknown

well,
he’s
the
one

bring
in

unknown
speaker
mr.
williams
you
probably
already
said
it
but
i
guess
i
didn’t
hear
it.
was
it
a
fact
--
was
it
proved
as
a
fact
that
this
plaintiff
had
been
a
small-time
bootlegger?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
i
understand
though
that
treating
this
as
a
private
sector
case
as
the
trial
judge
did,
it
would
not
have
been
a
defense
that
it
was
true?
unknown
speaker
but
suppose,
the
jury
had
found
that
was
true
would
they
nevertheless
under
new
hampshire
go
ahead
been
an
action
for
libel?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that,
i
don’t
quite
understand
that.
i
thought
you’re
theory
would
permit
anybody
to
put
that
right
into
the
public
discourse.
unknown
speaker
even
though
untrue
would
say
this
candidate
for
senator
has
eight
unsatisfied
judgment.
unknown
speaker
well
anybody
could
put
it
in.
unknown
speaker
a
columnist
or
anybody
else.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
said.
unknown
speaker
mr.
williams,
i
take
it
you
would
for
--
if
you
should
prevail
on
the
basic
law,
you
would
foreclose
the
plaintiffs
from
attempting
to
establish
the
new
york
times
standard
of
malice
from
which
you
just
said.
do
you
think
he
should
be
foreclosed
if
the
case
in
fact
was
tried
on
the
state
standard?
unknown
speaker
it
was
not.
unknown
speaker
now,
going
back
to
the
alleged
bootlegging
activities.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
fact
there
was
evidence
that
if
he
was
a
bootlegger
was
sometime
in
the
early
1930s.
there
was
some
evidence
of
that
was
presumably
being.
