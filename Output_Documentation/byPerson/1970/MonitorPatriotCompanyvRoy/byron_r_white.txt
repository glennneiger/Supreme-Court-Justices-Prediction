justice
byron
r.
white
so
does
your
distinction
depend
upon
the
identity
of
the
libeler
that
is
if
it’s
done
by
a
newspaper
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
by
anybody
publicly
to
the
public.
justice
byron
r.
white
it’s
protected
by
--
but
on
the
other
hand
if
it
it’s
just
a
private
communication
from
a
gossip
to
the
candidate’s
wife
then
it’s
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we
have
a
case
like
that
in
massachusetts.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
it
wouldn’t
require
any
brushes
with
the
law
to
prove
a
fellow
as
bootlegger
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that’s
arguing
the
evidence.
could
i
ask
you
if
it’s
under
the
court’s
instructions
that
it
was
essential?
absolutely
essential
and
unavoidable
for
the
jury
to
find
this
charge
was
false.
this
allegation
was
false
in
order
to
give
him
recovery?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
as
i
understand
your
colleague,
mr.
williams
and
as
i
read
the
instructions
of
the
court,
the
court
said
that
if
the
jury
found
this
was
on
the
private
side
of
the
libel
law
that
it
wasn’t
a
public
matter
to
which
new
york
times
applied,
that
even
if
the
matter
were
true,
the
defendant
had
to
justify
it.
is
that
--
that’s
where
the
recent
instructions.
that’s
--
is
that
the
way
you
read
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
judge
says
to
the
jury
that
is
the
plaintiff
and
a
private
defamation
is
entitled
to
recover
for
the
injury
done
to
him
unless
the
defendants
establish
justification.
justification
if
the
matter
was
true
and
published
for
a
justifiable
purpose.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
sure.
if
untrue
then
he
can’t
justify.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
he
goes
to
conditional
privilege.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
now
what
if
the
plaintiff.
what
if
the
jury
finds
in
his
own
mind
that
this
statement
is
true?
the
statement
is
true.
now
as
i
read
the
court’s
instructions
the
jury
then
does
not
automatically
give
a
recovery
even
if
he
thinks
it’s
just
defamatory.
justice
byron
r.
white
new
hampshire
law
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
maybe
what
new
hampshire
law
is
but
how
about
this
case.
we’re
citing
this
particular
case.
and
under
the
instructions
if
the
judge
said
that
even
if
it’s
true,
the
plaintiff
can
recover.
he
said
that
to
the
jury.
i
suppose
that
the
jury
might
have
found
that
was
true
but
still
given
a
recovery
because
the
defendant
didn’t
feel
it
was
a
justifiable
motive.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
and
that
is
--
does
the
supreme
court
opinion
straighten
this
out
or
no?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you
another
thing
about
the
instructions?
do
you
think
the
instructions
fairly
left
it
to
the
jury
to
decide
whether
this
was
a
so-called
private
matter
or
public
matter?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
was
the
overall
reading
of
the
instructions
that
--
or
did
the
judge
himself
decide
that
this
was
a
--
that
he
was
a
public
figure
or
public
official?
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
a
different.
that’s
a
different
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
issue
in
the
case
with
respect
to
whether
--
was
there
any
issue
with
respect
to
whether
the
plaintiff
was
a
public
figure
or
a
public
official?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
so
considered
he
is
a
public
official
or
a
public
figure,
to
which
the
new
york
times
rule
apply?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
think
that
if
that
if
a
publication
injures
a
public
candidate
a
candidate
for
public
office
in
the
minds
of
voters
injures
his
reputation
in
the
minds
of
voters
that
it
nevertheless
can
be
held
to
be
relevant
and
private?
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
your
position,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
the
constitutional
requirement
of
trial
by
jury,
in
your
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that’s
a
matter
of
your
state
constitution.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
didn’t
understand
that
to
be
his
argument.
i
thought
his
argument
was
that
he
concedes
that
new
york
times
v.
sullivan
is
fully
applicable
if
this
were
defamation
having
to
do
with
the
--
these
public
figures
of
record
as
a
public
figure
and
relevant
to
his
qualifications
as
a
candidate.
however,
he
argues
that
jury
was
entitled
to
find
as
the
court
instructed
them
in
this
case
that
the
defamation
had
--
did
not
touch
upon
or
was
relevant
in
any
way
to
his
fitness
for
the
office
for
which
he
was
a
candidate
but
had
to
do
with
his
long
forgotten
past
in
which
the
public
had
no
interest
and
then
if
the
jury
found
that
then
the
law
of
new
hampshire
is
applicable
and
what
the
law
of
new
hampshire
is
of
no
business
to
this
court
whatsoever
if
you
accept
his
hypothesis
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
the
first
amendment
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
accept
this
bifurcation
then
(voice
overlap)
the
law
in
new
hampshire
is
absolutely
no
interest
to
this
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
