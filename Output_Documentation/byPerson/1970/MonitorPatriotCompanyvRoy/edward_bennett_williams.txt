mr.
edward
bennett
williams
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
on
september
10,
1960,
a
column
appeared
on
the
concord,
new
hampshire
monitor
patriot
syndicated
and
distributed
by
the
northern
american
newspaper
alliance.
the
column
discussed
and
reported
upon
the
upcoming
new
hampshire
democratic
senatorial
primary
race.
the
column
had
been
written
by
the
late
drew
pearson.
the
column
reported
that
there
were
three
candidates
vying
for
the
democratic
nomination
to
oppose
the
republican
incumbent
the
late
senator
styles
bridges.
those
candidates
were
professor
herbert
hill,
a
dartmouth
college
professor,
a
respected
political
figure
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire
and
clearly
the
front-runner
in
the
race;
one
alphonse
roy
who
became
the
plaintiff
in
this
cause
in
the
court
below;
and
one
frank
sullivan
who
is
release
from
the
grasmere
county
jail
after
his
19th
conviction
for
public
drunkenness
had
been
obtained
on
the
eve
of
the
last
filing
date
by
candidate
roy,
so
the
column
reported.
the
column
further
reported
that
candidate
and
plaintiff
below
roy
had
induced
and
procured
sullivan’s
candidacy
as
a
means
of
attracting
an
ethnic
vote
away
from
hill
and
that
candidate
roy
had
done
this
in
consort
and
complicity
with
the
republican
incumbent
the
late
senator
bridges.
the
column
characterized
candidate
roy
as
“a
former
small-time
bootlegger,
later
u.s.
marshal.”
two
other
candidates
also
(inaudible)
of
the
new
hampshire
jail
system
had
been
disqualified
by
the
new
hampshire
ballot
commission,
so
the
column
reported.
roy
promptly
filed
suit
in
the
new
hampshire
courts
naming
that
concord
monitor
patriot
as
a
defendant
and
naming
north
american
newspaper
alliance
as
a
defendant.
he
alleged
three
specific
libels.
first,
the
characterization
of
him
as
a
former
small-time
bootlegger;
secondly,
the
fact
that
he
had
induced
and
procured
sullivan
as
a
candidate;
and
thirdly,
the
fact
that
he
had
done
so
in
complicity
with
the
republican
candidate.
after
trial,
the
jury
returned
the
verdict
for
the
plaintiff
against
both
concord
monitor
patriot
and
north
american
newspaper
alliance
solely
upon
the
characterization
of
roy
as
a
former
small-time
bootlegger
and
that
defamation
is
the
only
alleged
defamation
germane
to
the
appeal
in
this
case.
it
is
our
contention,
if
the
court
please
that
the
trial
judge
and
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
misread,
misgauged,
and
misconstrued
the
language
of
this
court
in
garrison
against
louisiana
decided
in
1964.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
was
$10,000
against
each
defendant
mr.
justice,
an
aggregate
of
$20,000
which
is
permissible
under
new
hampshire
law.
the
trial
judge,
if
the
court
please
gave
the
jury
what
was
a
bifurcated
instruction
on
the
law
of
libel.
he
told
them
that
if
they
found
that
the
characterization
of
roy
as
a
small-time
bootlegger
was
on
a
par
with
the
criticism
of
a
public
official
for
the
misconduct
of
his
office.
then
new
york
times
against
sullivan
would
be
applicable
and
it
would
be
necessary
for
the
plaintiff
to
show
malice
that
is
the
falsehood
was
uttered
with
knowledge
of
its
falsity
or
with
a
reckless
cavalier
disregard
as
to
its
truth
or
falsity.
trial
judge
did
not
stop
there.
he
went
on
and
told
the
jury
that
they
may
find
that
the
libel
was
in
what
he
characterized
as
the
private
sector.
he
said
that
if
the
alleged
defamation
had
no
relevancy
to
roy’s
fitness
for
office.
if
it
was
merely
a
bringing
forward
of
his
long
forgotten
past
misconduct,
if
it
was
on
a
matter
in
which
the
public
had
no
interest
then
it
was
a
private
libel
and
new
york
times
v.
sullivan
would
not
be
applicable
and
in
that
case,
the
plaintiff
might
recover
unless
the
defendant
successfully
asserted
one
of
two
defenses.
he
then
told
them
what
the
two
defenses
were
under
the
law
of
new
hampshire.
the
first
one
was
justification
and
the
second
one
was
conditional
privilege.
he
then
went
on
to
describe
the
defense
of
justification.
he
said
that
the
defendants
could
prevail
if
what
they
said
was
true
and
if
it
was
uttered
with
good
motive.
secondly,
he
told
them
that
the
defendants
might
prevail
if
the
defense
of
conditional
privilege
obtained
and
he
said
that
they
could
avail
themselves
of
conditional
privilege
even
if
what
they
have
uttered
was
untrue
if
it
was
uttered
with
a
reasonable
belief
in
its
truth,
a
reasonable
basis
for
believing
it
to
be
true
and
if
it
were
uttered
with
justifiable
purpose
and
good
motive.
he
told
the
jury
that
if
they
found
the
characterization
of
roy
to
have
been
a
public
libel
in
the
public
sector
under
new
york
times
v.
sullivan
then
they
must
exonerate
north
american
newspaper
alliance
because
there
have
been
no
showing
whatsoever
of
malice
against
north
american
newspaper
alliance.
obviously,
the
jury
found
the
libel
to
have
been
in
the
private
sector
because
it
returned
verdicts
against
each
defendant
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
exactly
mr.
justice.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
that’s
exactly
right
sir.
now,
it’s
our
contention,
if
the
court
please
that
the
trial
judge
committed
error
of
constitutional
dimension
when
it
permitted
the
jury
to
find
that
this
characterization
of
roy
could
be
a
so-called
“private
libel.”
it
is
our
contention,
if
the
court
please
that
the
rule
which
applies
to
public
officials
for
defamations
concerning
the
discharge
of
their
public
duties
namely
that
the
defamation
must
be
shown
to
have
been
made
with
malice
before
recovery
can
be
made
applies
a
fortiori
to
a
candidate
for
public
office
whether
he
aspires
to
executive,
legislative,
or
judicial
office.
it
is
our
contention,
if
the
court
please
that
the
logical
sequel
to
new
york
times
against
sullivan
is
that
defamations
against
candidates
for
public
office,
so
long
as
they
relate
to
the
fitness
of
the
candidate
for
office,
so
long
as
they
are
within
the
ambit
of
public
discourse
and
dialogue
regarding
the
qualifications
and
background
of
the
candidate,
have
a
constitutional
protection
unless
uttered
maliciously.
this
court
when
it
articulated
new
york
times
against
sullivan
cited
immediately
with
approbation
a
case
which
have
been
cited
for
almost
half
a
century
with
approbation
by
many
state
in
federal
courts.
it
dealt
with
a
candidate
for
office.
it
was
the
case
of
coleman
against
maclennan.
and
in
that
case,
eloquently
and
articulately,
and
precisely
is
stated
what
we
contend
should
be
the
rule.
there
the
court
said
it’s
of
the
utmost
consequence
that
the
people
should
discuss
the
character
and
qualifications
of
candidates
for
suffrages.
the
importance
to
the
state
and
to
society
of
such
discussion
is
so
vast
and
the
advantages
derived
is
so
great
that
they
more
than
counter-balance
the
inconvenience
of
private
persons
whose
conduct
may
be
involved
and
occasional
injury
to
the
reputation
of
individuals
must
yield
to
the
public
welfare
although
at
times
such
injuries
may
be
great.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
we
can
--
of
course,
he
was
a
public
figure
but
we
contend
mr.
justice
but
we
say
more
than
that
he
was
a
candidate
for
public
office
so
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
the
malice
rule
applying
to
him
in
his
aspiration
for
public
office.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
i
believe
it
would.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
this
court
in
curtis
publishing
company
against
butts
divided,
as
i
read
the
opinion,
with
respect
to
the
rule
that
should
apply
to
public
figures
as
against
public
officials.
i
say
that
there
is
no
reason
for
division
here
because
certainly
a
public
candidate
for
public
office
should
be
treated
as
a
public
official.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
public
official,
sir.
i
think
the
rule
that
applies
to
a
public
official
on
defamations
concerning
the
discharge
of
his
duties
should
apply
to
a
candidate
who
aspires
for
such
office
because
i
believe
that
when
a
candidate
announces
for
office.
he
lays
his
life
before
the
press
for
scrutiny
and
i
believe
that
anything
in
his
life
is
relevant
to
his
fitness
for
office,
his
private
life
or
his
public
life.
his
character,
his
mental
and
physical
health,
his
record
whether
it
be
academic,
professional,
commercial,
social,
marital,
or
criminal,
as
in
this
case.
i
believe
that
all
of
that
is
appropriate
for
public
discourse
and
that
there
is
a
constitutional
protection
surrounding
the
discourse
so
long
as
it
is
within
the
ambit
of
dialogue
relating
to
his
background,
his
qualifications
or
his
fitness
for
office.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
as
it
applies
to
this
case.
in
curtis
publishing
company
against
butts
where
the
court
discussed
in
great
detail
the
doctrine
relating
to
public
figures.
as
i
read
the
opinion,
four
justice
of
this
court
felt
that
there
should
be
a
rule
of
highly
unreasonable
conduct
applicable
to
the
press
before
a
recovery
could
be
made.
other
justices
felt
that
the
new
york
times
rule
applied.
the
rule
of
malice,
i
suggest
that
that
distinction
does
not
lie
with
respect
to
a
candidate
for
public
office.
i
believe
that
the
new
york
times
rule
should
apply
in
its
full
import
and
all
of
its
implications
with
respect
to
a
candidate
for
public
office.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
so.
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
so
we
contend,
if
the
court
please
that
any
other
rule
--
any
other
rule
would
ice
the
wings
of
public
debate
concerning
candidates
for
office,
concerning
as
in
this
case
a
candidate
for
a
high
office.
it
would
depth
and
the
bigger
and
limit
the
variety
of
discourse
with
respect
to
the
qualifications
of
the
candidate
for
office.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
there
were
five
witnesses,
mr.
justice
who
testified
that
he
had
the
reputation
for
having
been
a
small-time
bootlegger.
he
vigorously
denied
this
and
claimed
that
his
brothers
were
the
bootleggers
but
one
witness
took
the
stand
who
had
been
the
original
source
of
the
information
for
the
writer
of
this
column
and
swore
that
this
man
had
been
a
former
small-time
bootlegger
and
had
admitted
it
to
him.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
would
have
been
a
defense
mr.
justice
under
the
new
hampshire
rule
of
conditional
privilege
even
if
it
were
not
true
if
the
defendants
reasonably
believed
it
to
be
true
but
if
they
uttered
it
with
justifiable
purpose
and
good
motive.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir
there
would
have
been
because
under
the
defense
of
justification,
even
though
the
allegation
is
true
unless
it
is
published
with
justifiable
purpose.
there
may
be
a
recovery
by
the
plaintiff
and
that’s
what
the
jury
was
told
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
your
honor
that
it
certainly
a
fragment
of
state
libel
law
has
survived
and
i
think
that
the
trial
judge
in
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
misgauged
how
much
of
it
survived.
the
trial
judge,
if
the
court
please
read
garrison
against
louisiana
to
support
the
instruction
which
he
gave
to
the
jury.
you’ll
remember,
if
the
court
please
that
in
that
case
this
court
discuss
the
defense
of
truth
to
the
criminal
libel
law
of
louisiana
and
discuss
the
limitation
on
truth
namely
that
the
utterance
had
to
have
been
made
with
good
motive.
in
a
footnote,
the
court
said
this,
footnote
8.
“we
recognize
that
different
interest
may
be
involved
were
purely
private
libels,
totally
unrelated
to
public
affairs
are
concerned.
therefore,
nothing
we
say
today
is
to
be
taken
as
emanating
any
views
as
to
the
impact
of
the
constitutional
guarantees
in
the
discreet
area
of
purely
private
lives.”
now,
we
do
not
contend,
if
the
court
please
here
before
this
court
that
the
moment
that
a
man
announces
that
he
is
a
candidate
for
high
office
in
this
land
that
he
loses
all
his
rights
under
the
area,
in
the
area
of
defamation,
all
the
rights
at
a
(inaudible)
as
a
private
citizen.
for
example,
if
a
candidate
announced
that
he
was
going
to
run
for
the
senate
and
simultaneously
in
an
unrelated
transaction
he
was
seeking
to
buy
a
house.
and
the
perspective
vendor
send
a
credit
report
--
was
send
a
credit
report
by
a
credit
information
bureau
in
which
it
was
said
untruthfully
that
he
had
eight
unsatisfied
judgments
against
you
and
if
the
sale
were
cancelled
because
of
that
then
if
that
defamation
never
got
into
the
public
discourse
concerning
his
fitness
for
office,
if
it
never
became
part
of
the
dialogue
concerning
his
qualifications,
if
it
never
came
within
in
the
ambit
of
what
was
uttered
to
influence
votes
but
remain
purely
private
between
the
credit
information
bureau
and
the
perspective
vendor,
we
say
that
his
rights
would
survive
as
a
citizen
under
appropriate
new
hampshire
law
or
if
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
i
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
and
if
it
got
into
the
public
discourse
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
could
be
put
it
in.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
and
once
it
got
into
the
public
discourse,
it
would
have
a
constitutional
umbrella
over
it.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
exactly,
that’s
what
i
say.
but
take
another
illustration.
if
a
gossip
should
go
to
the
candidate’s
wife
during
the
campaign
and
say
that
he
was
conducting
a
meretricious
relationship
with
one
of
the
staff
while
out
on
the
hustings
and
if
that
stayed
private,
if
it
broke
his
marriage.
what
if
it
never
got
into
the
public
dialogue?
if
it
never
became
part
of
the
public
discourse,
then
i
suggest
it
will
remain
in
what
this
court
characterized
as
the
discreet
area
of
purely
private
libel.
but
once
it
was
injected
into
the
discourse
concerning
his
qualifications
fitness
for
office
by
the
press
or
by
his
opponent
or
by
any
member
of
the
media
then
it
would
have
a
constitutional
umbrella
protecting
it
unless
maliciously
uttered.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
don’t
think.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
that
the
chances
are
very
high
than
any
defamation
that
is
uttered
during
the
life
of
a
campaign
will
find
its
way
into
the
public
dialogue
and
get
the
protection
of
the
constitution.
but
i
say
that
it
is
possible
certainly.
it
is
possible
certainly
that
there
could
be
a
defamation
in
what
this
court
has
called
a
discreet
area
of
purely
private
liable
where
the
candidate
would
still
retain
his
rights
as
a
citizen.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
but
the
public
might
not
find
out.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
i
think
it
could
happen
mr.
justice.
i
think
it
could
happen.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
no.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
it
depends
upon
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
not.
i
think
not
mr.
justice.
i
think
it
depends
upon
two
things.
i
think
it
depends
upon
whether
the
utterance
comes
within
the
perimeters
of
public
disburse
on
the
candidate’s
fitness.
i
think
it
depends
upon
the
design,
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
uttered
in
the
first
instance.
i
don’t
think
that
we
can
divorce
ourselves
from
the
content
from
the
design
at
which
it’s
uttered.
i
think
if
its
gets
into
the
ambit
of
public
discourse
regarding
the
candidates
fitness
for
office
then
it
has
the
constitutional
protection.
now,
certain
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think,
no
sir.
i
think
it
would
be
a
matter
of
such
high
public
interest
that
it
would
fall
within
the
perimeters
of
curtis
publishing
company
against
butts.
and
therefore
that
the
times
rule
would
apply
to
this
particular
kind
of
libel
which
you
cite
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
even
though
he
himself
may
not
be
known
to
the
public.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
because
i
think
it’s
a
matter
of
such
high
public
interest,
a
matter
in
which
the
public
has
such
a
deep
concern.
now
in
this
case
of
course
we’re
dealing
with
the
characterization
of
the
man
as
a
bootlegger,
as
a
lawbreaker.
certainly,
it
cannot
be
held
to
be
irrelevant
to
its
fitness
for
office.
this
court
nine
years
ago
found
that
whether
a
man
was
a
bootlegger
or
not
was
relevant
to
his
fitness
for
citizenship.
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
if
its
relevant
to
its
fitness
for
citizenship,
it’s
relevant
to
its
fitness
for
membership
in
the
united
states
senate.
in
costello
against
the
united
states,
decided
in
1961,
the
court
found
that
the
bureau
of
immigration
and
naturalization
might
certainly
have
turned
away
this
applicant
for
american
citizenship
if
they
have
known
that
he
was
a
former
bootlegger.
and
i
say,
a
fortiori
it
applies
here.
now,
we
ask
not
simply
that
this
case
be
remanded
because
indeed
there’s
no
cause
for
remand.
we
ask
that
it
be
reversed
became
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
this
alleged
defamation
was
done
with
malice
on
the
part
of
these
defendants.
the
trial
judge
himself
found
absolutely
no
malice
with
respect
to
north
american
newspaper
alliance.
the
record
is
completely
devoid
of
any
evidence
of
malice
with
respect
to
the
concord
monitor
patriot.
they
subscribed
to
this
column.
they
relied
on
the
information
in
it.
but
beyond
that,
the
testimony
in
the
record
was
that
the
editor
of
the
paper
himself
knew
of
the
plaintiff’s
reputation
as
a
former
bootlegger.
he
read
the
column
before
he
allowed
it
to
be
defendant
relying
on
his
own
information
as
well
as
the
prior
experience
with
the
columnists.
he
permitted
the
column
to
go
forward.
there
was
no
evidence
in
this
record
which
suggested
that
there
was
any
awareness
of
falsity
or
that
there
was
any
reckless
or
cavalier
disregard
as
to
the
truth
or
falsity
of
the
publication
on
the
part
of
concord
monitor
patriot.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
not
if
it
had
been
mr.
justice
but
it
was
not.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
in
fact
the
trial
post-dated
new
york
times
v.
sullivan
and
appropriate
amendments
were
made
to
the
pleadings
to
allege
malice
within
the
purview
of
new
york
times
against
sullivan
and
the
plaintiff
put
proof
in
to
show
malice
so
as
to
comply
with
standards
of
new
york
times
against
sullivan
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
may
exceed
unnecessary
for
a
remand
for
that
purpose.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
was
not
specified
mr.
justice
but
it
had
to
be
26
years
at
least
because
the
volstead
act
had
died
26
years
before
the
campaign.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i’m
sorry
mr.
justice.
i’m
sorry.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
no
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
was
using
the
term
“bootlegger”
as
a
term
of
art
to
describe
people
who
traffic
in
whiskey
at
the
time
when
it
was
illegal
to
traffic
in
whiskey.
but
i
agree
mr.
justice
it’s
possible
that
he
could
have
been
a
bootlegger
even
after
the
inhibitions
against
the
sale
of
liquor
were
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
but
probable
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
don’t
know
whether
it
takes
place
in
new
hampshire
mr.
justice.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes.
that’s
right.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
thank
you
mr.
williams.
mr.
brown.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
thank
you
sir.
under
the
instructions
that
the
trial
judge
gave,
it
was
entirely
possible
for
the
jury
to
have
found
that
the
alleged
defamation
was
true
and
yet
to
permit
recovery
for
the
plaintiff.
let
me
read
the
instruction.
the
trial
judge
said,
“if
you
decided
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
page
11
of
our
brief,
if
the
court
please.
the
word
is
quoted
in
(inaudible).
if
you’ve
decided
that
it’s
a
private
defamation.
the
plaintiff
would
be
entitled
to
recover
unless
the
defamatory
matter
was
justified.
now
justification
is
established
if
the
facts
stated
are
true
and
are
published
with
the
justifiable
motive.
so
the
jury
was
given
free
license
to
find
that
this
publication
was
not
with
a
justifiable
motive
and
even
thought
the
allegation
was
true,
they
could
have
been
brought
in
a
verdict
in
this
case
for
the
plaintiff.
now,
the
counsel
concedes
that
new
york
times
v.
sullivan
is
appropriate
here
for
application.
so
what
counsel
is
arguing
to
this
court
is
that
under
new
york
times
against
sullivan
that
its
possible
that
an
alleged
defamation
may
be
true
and
yet
a
recovery
may
be
had
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
if
you
accept
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
if
you
accept
the
hypothesis
that
you
can
utter
in
the
public
dialogue
a
defamation
concerning
a
candidate
for
high
office
that
is
irrelevant
to
his
fitness
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
suggest,
if
the
court
please
that
it’s
a
constitutional
impossibility
to
utter
a
defamation
about
a
candidate
for
high
office
that
is
irrelevant
because
the
mere
fact
that
damage
flows
to
him
as
he
alleges
makes
it
relevant
if
it
influences
the
electorate.
if
the
court
please,
counsel
said
in
quoting
the
record,
“that
the
columnist
pearson
did
not
write
this
to
influence
the
electorate
but
rather
wrote
it
in
a
purely
private
vain,”
this
does
violence
to
the
record
because
at
page
194,
the
very
page
which
he
cites
the
witness
pearson
said
that
he
wrote
this
to
let
the
voters
--
because
the
voters
had
a
right
to
know
the
background
of
every
candidate
which
is
a
precise
reason
for
the
constitutional
rule
articulated
in
times
v.
sullivan.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
on
september
10,
1960,
a
column
appeared
on
the
concord,
new
hampshire
monitor
patriot
syndicated
and
distributed
by
the
northern
american
newspaper
alliance.
the
column
discussed
and
reported
upon
the
upcoming
new
hampshire
democratic
senatorial
primary
race.
the
column
had
been
written
by
the
late
drew
pearson.
the
column
reported
that
there
were
three
candidates
vying
for
the
democratic
nomination
to
oppose
the
republican
incumbent
the
late
senator
styles
bridges.
those
candidates
were
professor
herbert
hill,
a
dartmouth
college
professor,
a
respected
political
figure
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire
and
clearly
the
front-runner
in
the
race;
one
alphonse
roy
who
became
the
plaintiff
in
this
cause
in
the
court
below;
and
one
frank
sullivan
who
is
release
from
the
grasmere
county
jail
after
his
19th
conviction
for
public
drunkenness
had
been
obtained
on
the
eve
of
the
last
filing
date
by
candidate
roy,
so
the
column
reported.
the
column
further
reported
that
candidate
and
plaintiff
below
roy
had
induced
and
procured
sullivan’s
candidacy
as
a
means
of
attracting
an
ethnic
vote
away
from
hill
and
that
candidate
roy
had
done
this
in
consort
and
complicity
with
the
republican
incumbent
the
late
senator
bridges.
the
column
characterized
candidate
roy
as
“a
former
small-time
bootlegger,
later
u.s.
marshal.”
two
other
candidates
also
(inaudible)
of
the
new
hampshire
jail
system
had
been
disqualified
by
the
new
hampshire
ballot
commission,
so
the
column
reported.
roy
promptly
filed
suit
in
the
new
hampshire
courts
naming
that
concord
monitor
patriot
as
a
defendant
and
naming
north
american
newspaper
alliance
as
a
defendant.
he
alleged
three
specific
libels.
first,
the
characterization
of
him
as
a
former
small-time
bootlegger;
secondly,
the
fact
that
he
had
induced
and
procured
sullivan
as
a
candidate;
and
thirdly,
the
fact
that
he
had
done
so
in
complicity
with
the
republican
candidate.
after
trial,
the
jury
returned
the
verdict
for
the
plaintiff
against
both
concord
monitor
patriot
and
north
american
newspaper
alliance
solely
upon
the
characterization
of
roy
as
a
former
small-time
bootlegger
and
that
defamation
is
the
only
alleged
defamation
germane
to
the
appeal
in
this
case.
it
is
our
contention,
if
the
court
please
that
the
trial
judge
and
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
misread,
misgauged,
and
misconstrued
the
language
of
this
court
in
garrison
against
louisiana
decided
in
1964.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
was
$10,000
against
each
defendant
mr.
justice,
an
aggregate
of
$20,000
which
is
permissible
under
new
hampshire
law.
the
trial
judge,
if
the
court
please
gave
the
jury
what
was
a
bifurcated
instruction
on
the
law
of
libel.
he
told
them
that
if
they
found
that
the
characterization
of
roy
as
a
small-time
bootlegger
was
on
a
par
with
the
criticism
of
a
public
official
for
the
misconduct
of
his
office.
then
new
york
times
against
sullivan
would
be
applicable
and
it
would
be
necessary
for
the
plaintiff
to
show
malice
that
is
the
falsehood
was
uttered
with
knowledge
of
its
falsity
or
with
a
reckless
cavalier
disregard
as
to
its
truth
or
falsity.
trial
judge
did
not
stop
there.
he
went
on
and
told
the
jury
that
they
may
find
that
the
libel
was
in
what
he
characterized
as
the
private
sector.
he
said
that
if
the
alleged
defamation
had
no
relevancy
to
roy’s
fitness
for
office.
if
it
was
merely
a
bringing
forward
of
his
long
forgotten
past
misconduct,
if
it
was
on
a
matter
in
which
the
public
had
no
interest
then
it
was
a
private
libel
and
new
york
times
v.
sullivan
would
not
be
applicable
and
in
that
case,
the
plaintiff
might
recover
unless
the
defendant
successfully
asserted
one
of
two
defenses.
he
then
told
them
what
the
two
defenses
were
under
the
law
of
new
hampshire.
the
first
one
was
justification
and
the
second
one
was
conditional
privilege.
he
then
went
on
to
describe
the
defense
of
justification.
he
said
that
the
defendants
could
prevail
if
what
they
said
was
true
and
if
it
was
uttered
with
good
motive.
secondly,
he
told
them
that
the
defendants
might
prevail
if
the
defense
of
conditional
privilege
obtained
and
he
said
that
they
could
avail
themselves
of
conditional
privilege
even
if
what
they
have
uttered
was
untrue
if
it
was
uttered
with
a
reasonable
belief
in
its
truth,
a
reasonable
basis
for
believing
it
to
be
true
and
if
it
were
uttered
with
justifiable
purpose
and
good
motive.
he
told
the
jury
that
if
they
found
the
characterization
of
roy
to
have
been
a
public
libel
in
the
public
sector
under
new
york
times
v.
sullivan
then
they
must
exonerate
north
american
newspaper
alliance
because
there
have
been
no
showing
whatsoever
of
malice
against
north
american
newspaper
alliance.
obviously,
the
jury
found
the
libel
to
have
been
in
the
private
sector
because
it
returned
verdicts
against
each
defendant
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
exactly
mr.
justice.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
that’s
exactly
right
sir.
now,
it’s
our
contention,
if
the
court
please
that
the
trial
judge
committed
error
of
constitutional
dimension
when
it
permitted
the
jury
to
find
that
this
characterization
of
roy
could
be
a
so-called
“private
libel.”
it
is
our
contention,
if
the
court
please
that
the
rule
which
applies
to
public
officials
for
defamations
concerning
the
discharge
of
their
public
duties
namely
that
the
defamation
must
be
shown
to
have
been
made
with
malice
before
recovery
can
be
made
applies
a
fortiori
to
a
candidate
for
public
office
whether
he
aspires
to
executive,
legislative,
or
judicial
office.
it
is
our
contention,
if
the
court
please
that
the
logical
sequel
to
new
york
times
against
sullivan
is
that
defamations
against
candidates
for
public
office,
so
long
as
they
relate
to
the
fitness
of
the
candidate
for
office,
so
long
as
they
are
within
the
ambit
of
public
discourse
and
dialogue
regarding
the
qualifications
and
background
of
the
candidate,
have
a
constitutional
protection
unless
uttered
maliciously.
this
court
when
it
articulated
new
york
times
against
sullivan
cited
immediately
with
approbation
a
case
which
have
been
cited
for
almost
half
a
century
with
approbation
by
many
state
in
federal
courts.
it
dealt
with
a
candidate
for
office.
it
was
the
case
of
coleman
against
maclennan.
and
in
that
case,
eloquently
and
articulately,
and
precisely
is
stated
what
we
contend
should
be
the
rule.
there
the
court
said
it’s
of
the
utmost
consequence
that
the
people
should
discuss
the
character
and
qualifications
of
candidates
for
suffrages.
the
importance
to
the
state
and
to
society
of
such
discussion
is
so
vast
and
the
advantages
derived
is
so
great
that
they
more
than
counter-balance
the
inconvenience
of
private
persons
whose
conduct
may
be
involved
and
occasional
injury
to
the
reputation
of
individuals
must
yield
to
the
public
welfare
although
at
times
such
injuries
may
be
great.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
we
can
--
of
course,
he
was
a
public
figure
but
we
contend
mr.
justice
but
we
say
more
than
that
he
was
a
candidate
for
public
office
so
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
the
malice
rule
applying
to
him
in
his
aspiration
for
public
office.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
i
believe
it
would.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
this
court
in
curtis
publishing
company
against
butts
divided,
as
i
read
the
opinion,
with
respect
to
the
rule
that
should
apply
to
public
figures
as
against
public
officials.
i
say
that
there
is
no
reason
for
division
here
because
certainly
a
public
candidate
for
public
office
should
be
treated
as
a
public
official.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
public
official,
sir.
i
think
the
rule
that
applies
to
a
public
official
on
defamations
concerning
the
discharge
of
his
duties
should
apply
to
a
candidate
who
aspires
for
such
office
because
i
believe
that
when
a
candidate
announces
for
office.
he
lays
his
life
before
the
press
for
scrutiny
and
i
believe
that
anything
in
his
life
is
relevant
to
his
fitness
for
office,
his
private
life
or
his
public
life.
his
character,
his
mental
and
physical
health,
his
record
whether
it
be
academic,
professional,
commercial,
social,
marital,
or
criminal,
as
in
this
case.
i
believe
that
all
of
that
is
appropriate
for
public
discourse
and
that
there
is
a
constitutional
protection
surrounding
the
discourse
so
long
as
it
is
within
the
ambit
of
dialogue
relating
to
his
background,
his
qualifications
or
his
fitness
for
office.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
as
it
applies
to
this
case.
in
curtis
publishing
company
against
butts
where
the
court
discussed
in
great
detail
the
doctrine
relating
to
public
figures.
as
i
read
the
opinion,
four
justice
of
this
court
felt
that
there
should
be
a
rule
of
highly
unreasonable
conduct
applicable
to
the
press
before
a
recovery
could
be
made.
other
justices
felt
that
the
new
york
times
rule
applied.
the
rule
of
malice,
i
suggest
that
that
distinction
does
not
lie
with
respect
to
a
candidate
for
public
office.
i
believe
that
the
new
york
times
rule
should
apply
in
its
full
import
and
all
of
its
implications
with
respect
to
a
candidate
for
public
office.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
so.
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
so
we
contend,
if
the
court
please
that
any
other
rule
--
any
other
rule
would
ice
the
wings
of
public
debate
concerning
candidates
for
office,
concerning
as
in
this
case
a
candidate
for
a
high
office.
it
would
depth
and
the
bigger
and
limit
the
variety
of
discourse
with
respect
to
the
qualifications
of
the
candidate
for
office.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
there
were
five
witnesses,
mr.
justice
who
testified
that
he
had
the
reputation
for
having
been
a
small-time
bootlegger.
he
vigorously
denied
this
and
claimed
that
his
brothers
were
the
bootleggers
but
one
witness
took
the
stand
who
had
been
the
original
source
of
the
information
for
the
writer
of
this
column
and
swore
that
this
man
had
been
a
former
small-time
bootlegger
and
had
admitted
it
to
him.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
would
have
been
a
defense
mr.
justice
under
the
new
hampshire
rule
of
conditional
privilege
even
if
it
were
not
true
if
the
defendants
reasonably
believed
it
to
be
true
but
if
they
uttered
it
with
justifiable
purpose
and
good
motive.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir
there
would
have
been
because
under
the
defense
of
justification,
even
though
the
allegation
is
true
unless
it
is
published
with
justifiable
purpose.
there
may
be
a
recovery
by
the
plaintiff
and
that’s
what
the
jury
was
told
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
your
honor
that
it
certainly
a
fragment
of
state
libel
law
has
survived
and
i
think
that
the
trial
judge
in
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
misgauged
how
much
of
it
survived.
the
trial
judge,
if
the
court
please
read
garrison
against
louisiana
to
support
the
instruction
which
he
gave
to
the
jury.
you’ll
remember,
if
the
court
please
that
in
that
case
this
court
discuss
the
defense
of
truth
to
the
criminal
libel
law
of
louisiana
and
discuss
the
limitation
on
truth
namely
that
the
utterance
had
to
have
been
made
with
good
motive.
in
a
footnote,
the
court
said
this,
footnote
8.
“we
recognize
that
different
interest
may
be
involved
were
purely
private
libels,
totally
unrelated
to
public
affairs
are
concerned.
therefore,
nothing
we
say
today
is
to
be
taken
as
emanating
any
views
as
to
the
impact
of
the
constitutional
guarantees
in
the
discreet
area
of
purely
private
lives.”
now,
we
do
not
contend,
if
the
court
please
here
before
this
court
that
the
moment
that
a
man
announces
that
he
is
a
candidate
for
high
office
in
this
land
that
he
loses
all
his
rights
under
the
area,
in
the
area
of
defamation,
all
the
rights
at
a
(inaudible)
as
a
private
citizen.
for
example,
if
a
candidate
announced
that
he
was
going
to
run
for
the
senate
and
simultaneously
in
an
unrelated
transaction
he
was
seeking
to
buy
a
house.
and
the
perspective
vendor
send
a
credit
report
--
was
send
a
credit
report
by
a
credit
information
bureau
in
which
it
was
said
untruthfully
that
he
had
eight
unsatisfied
judgments
against
you
and
if
the
sale
were
cancelled
because
of
that
then
if
that
defamation
never
got
into
the
public
discourse
concerning
his
fitness
for
office,
if
it
never
became
part
of
the
dialogue
concerning
his
qualifications,
if
it
never
came
within
in
the
ambit
of
what
was
uttered
to
influence
votes
but
remain
purely
private
between
the
credit
information
bureau
and
the
perspective
vendor,
we
say
that
his
rights
would
survive
as
a
citizen
under
appropriate
new
hampshire
law
or
if
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
i
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
and
if
it
got
into
the
public
discourse
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
could
be
put
it
in.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
and
once
it
got
into
the
public
discourse,
it
would
have
a
constitutional
umbrella
over
it.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
exactly,
that’s
what
i
say.
but
take
another
illustration.
if
a
gossip
should
go
to
the
candidate’s
wife
during
the
campaign
and
say
that
he
was
conducting
a
meretricious
relationship
with
one
of
the
staff
while
out
on
the
hustings
and
if
that
stayed
private,
if
it
broke
his
marriage.
what
if
it
never
got
into
the
public
dialogue?
if
it
never
became
part
of
the
public
discourse,
then
i
suggest
it
will
remain
in
what
this
court
characterized
as
the
discreet
area
of
purely
private
libel.
but
once
it
was
injected
into
the
discourse
concerning
his
qualifications
fitness
for
office
by
the
press
or
by
his
opponent
or
by
any
member
of
the
media
then
it
would
have
a
constitutional
umbrella
protecting
it
unless
maliciously
uttered.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
don’t
think.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
that
the
chances
are
very
high
than
any
defamation
that
is
uttered
during
the
life
of
a
campaign
will
find
its
way
into
the
public
dialogue
and
get
the
protection
of
the
constitution.
but
i
say
that
it
is
possible
certainly.
it
is
possible
certainly
that
there
could
be
a
defamation
in
what
this
court
has
called
a
discreet
area
of
purely
private
liable
where
the
candidate
would
still
retain
his
rights
as
a
citizen.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
but
the
public
might
not
find
out.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
i
think
it
could
happen
mr.
justice.
i
think
it
could
happen.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
no.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
it
depends
upon
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
not.
i
think
not
mr.
justice.
i
think
it
depends
upon
two
things.
i
think
it
depends
upon
whether
the
utterance
comes
within
the
perimeters
of
public
disburse
on
the
candidate’s
fitness.
i
think
it
depends
upon
the
design,
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
uttered
in
the
first
instance.
i
don’t
think
that
we
can
divorce
ourselves
from
the
content
from
the
design
at
which
it’s
uttered.
i
think
if
its
gets
into
the
ambit
of
public
discourse
regarding
the
candidates
fitness
for
office
then
it
has
the
constitutional
protection.
now,
certain
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think,
no
sir.
i
think
it
would
be
a
matter
of
such
high
public
interest
that
it
would
fall
within
the
perimeters
of
curtis
publishing
company
against
butts.
and
therefore
that
the
times
rule
would
apply
to
this
particular
kind
of
libel
which
you
cite
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
even
though
he
himself
may
not
be
known
to
the
public.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
because
i
think
it’s
a
matter
of
such
high
public
interest,
a
matter
in
which
the
public
has
such
a
deep
concern.
now
in
this
case
of
course
we’re
dealing
with
the
characterization
of
the
man
as
a
bootlegger,
as
a
lawbreaker.
certainly,
it
cannot
be
held
to
be
irrelevant
to
its
fitness
for
office.
this
court
nine
years
ago
found
that
whether
a
man
was
a
bootlegger
or
not
was
relevant
to
his
fitness
for
citizenship.
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
if
its
relevant
to
its
fitness
for
citizenship,
it’s
relevant
to
its
fitness
for
membership
in
the
united
states
senate.
in
costello
against
the
united
states,
decided
in
1961,
the
court
found
that
the
bureau
of
immigration
and
naturalization
might
certainly
have
turned
away
this
applicant
for
american
citizenship
if
they
have
known
that
he
was
a
former
bootlegger.
and
i
say,
a
fortiori
it
applies
here.
now,
we
ask
not
simply
that
this
case
be
remanded
because
indeed
there’s
no
cause
for
remand.
we
ask
that
it
be
reversed
became
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
this
alleged
defamation
was
done
with
malice
on
the
part
of
these
defendants.
the
trial
judge
himself
found
absolutely
no
malice
with
respect
to
north
american
newspaper
alliance.
the
record
is
completely
devoid
of
any
evidence
of
malice
with
respect
to
the
concord
monitor
patriot.
they
subscribed
to
this
column.
they
relied
on
the
information
in
it.
but
beyond
that,
the
testimony
in
the
record
was
that
the
editor
of
the
paper
himself
knew
of
the
plaintiff’s
reputation
as
a
former
bootlegger.
he
read
the
column
before
he
allowed
it
to
be
defendant
relying
on
his
own
information
as
well
as
the
prior
experience
with
the
columnists.
he
permitted
the
column
to
go
forward.
there
was
no
evidence
in
this
record
which
suggested
that
there
was
any
awareness
of
falsity
or
that
there
was
any
reckless
or
cavalier
disregard
as
to
the
truth
or
falsity
of
the
publication
on
the
part
of
concord
monitor
patriot.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
not
if
it
had
been
mr.
justice
but
it
was
not.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
in
fact
the
trial
post-dated
new
york
times
v.
sullivan
and
appropriate
amendments
were
made
to
the
pleadings
to
allege
malice
within
the
purview
of
new
york
times
against
sullivan
and
the
plaintiff
put
proof
in
to
show
malice
so
as
to
comply
with
standards
of
new
york
times
against
sullivan
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
may
exceed
unnecessary
for
a
remand
for
that
purpose.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
was
not
specified
mr.
justice
but
it
had
to
be
26
years
at
least
because
the
volstead
act
had
died
26
years
before
the
campaign.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i’m
sorry
mr.
justice.
i’m
sorry.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
no
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
was
using
the
term
“bootlegger”
as
a
term
of
art
to
describe
people
who
traffic
in
whiskey
at
the
time
when
it
was
illegal
to
traffic
in
whiskey.
but
i
agree
mr.
justice
it’s
possible
that
he
could
have
been
a
bootlegger
even
after
the
inhibitions
against
the
sale
of
liquor
were
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
but
probable
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
don’t
know
whether
it
takes
place
in
new
hampshire
mr.
justice.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes.
that’s
right.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
thank
you
mr.
williams.
mr.
brown.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
thank
you
sir.
under
the
instructions
that
the
trial
judge
gave,
it
was
entirely
possible
for
the
jury
to
have
found
that
the
alleged
defamation
was
true
and
yet
to
permit
recovery
for
the
plaintiff.
let
me
read
the
instruction.
the
trial
judge
said,
“if
you
decided
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
page
11
of
our
brief,
if
the
court
please.
the
word
is
quoted
in
(inaudible).
if
you’ve
decided
that
it’s
a
private
defamation.
the
plaintiff
would
be
entitled
to
recover
unless
the
defamatory
matter
was
justified.
now
justification
is
established
if
the
facts
stated
are
true
and
are
published
with
the
justifiable
motive.
so
the
jury
was
given
free
license
to
find
that
this
publication
was
not
with
a
justifiable
motive
and
even
thought
the
allegation
was
true,
they
could
have
been
brought
in
a
verdict
in
this
case
for
the
plaintiff.
now,
the
counsel
concedes
that
new
york
times
v.
sullivan
is
appropriate
here
for
application.
so
what
counsel
is
arguing
to
this
court
is
that
under
new
york
times
against
sullivan
that
its
possible
that
an
alleged
defamation
may
be
true
and
yet
a
recovery
may
be
had
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
if
you
accept
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
if
you
accept
the
hypothesis
that
you
can
utter
in
the
public
dialogue
a
defamation
concerning
a
candidate
for
high
office
that
is
irrelevant
to
his
fitness
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
suggest,
if
the
court
please
that
it’s
a
constitutional
impossibility
to
utter
a
defamation
about
a
candidate
for
high
office
that
is
irrelevant
because
the
mere
fact
that
damage
flows
to
him
as
he
alleges
makes
it
relevant
if
it
influences
the
electorate.
if
the
court
please,
counsel
said
in
quoting
the
record,
“that
the
columnist
pearson
did
not
write
this
to
influence
the
electorate
but
rather
wrote
it
in
a
purely
private
vain,”
this
does
violence
to
the
record
because
at
page
194,
the
very
page
which
he
cites
the
witness
pearson
said
that
he
wrote
this
to
let
the
voters
--
because
the
voters
had
a
right
to
know
the
background
of
every
candidate
which
is
a
precise
reason
for
the
constitutional
rule
articulated
in
times
v.
sullivan.
thank
you
your
honor.
