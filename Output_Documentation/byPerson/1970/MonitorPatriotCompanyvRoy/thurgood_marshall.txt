well,
imagine
we
have
many
bootleggers
in

they
allow

mr.
brown,
on
this
private
sector
thing.
i
think
i’m
confused.
suppose
they
said
that
this
was
man
was
bootlegging
last
year,
would
that
be
in
private
sector?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that’s
what
worries
me
is
that
the
position
of
real
court
in
the
passage
of
time
puts
in
the
private
sector.
i
mean
the
words
the
private
gets
me
into
trouble
that
a
candidate
for
public
office
as
a
private
sector.
justice
thurgood

maybe
i’m
quarreling
with
the
word
“private.”
