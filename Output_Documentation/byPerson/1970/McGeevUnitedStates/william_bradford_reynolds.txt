mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
the
cases
of
falbo
and
estep,
read
together
fairly
established
that
the
principle
of
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
does
have
a
place
in
criminal
actions
brought
under
the
selective
service
laws
and
that
general
concept
was
not
under
attack
in
the
recent
mckart
and
duvernay
cases.
they
involve
instead,
exceptional
circumstances,
set
to
warrant
a
relaxation
of
the
doctrine
on
particular
facts
presented.
petitioner
seeks
to
have
this
court
overrule
falbo,
estep
and
their
progeny,
primarily
because
as
i
understand
the
argument,
he
come
before
the
courts
not
as
a
plaintiff
seeking
affirmative
relief,
but
as
a
defendant
charged
with
a
criminal
offense.
at
the
outset,
it
seems
that
if
an
application
of
the
exhaustion
doctrine
were
to
turn
on
such
a
distinction,
the
effect
would
be
in
essence
to
penalize
the
registrant
who
after
failing
to
exercise
his
administrative
remedies
decides
to
obey
the
law
and
submit
to
induction,
seeking
affirmative
relief
in
the
courts
through
a
habeas
corpus
action.
he
would,
under
petitioner's
theory,
be
precluded
by
the
exhaustion
doctrine
from
challenging
his
classification.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
same
registrant
had
decided
to
violate
the
law
and
he
then
been
criminally
prosecuted,
petitioner
maintains
that
he
cannot
similarly
be
barred
from
raising
the
same
claim
as
a
defense.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that's
correct,
your
honor,
assuming
the
--
if
a
criminal
prosecution
filed
and
he
did
(inaudible).
we
do
not
think
the
exhaustion
doctrine
was
ever
intended
to
be
applied
in
a
manner
which
would
encourage
registrants
to
refuse
induction
and
discourage
them
from
complying
with
the
law
and
testing
their
classification
in
habeas
corpus
proceedings.
moreover,
to
insist
that
the
exhaustion
doctrine
cannot
be
invoked
under
any
circumstances
in
criminal
prosecutions
under
the
selective
service
laws,
is
to
ignore
the
statutory
scheme
on
which
this
court
has
based
its
earlier
decisions
in
this
area.
congress
and
the
president
have
carefully
constructed
a
very
comprehensive
and
fair
administrative
appeal
process
within
the
selective
service
system.
at
the
time
a
local
board
classifies
a
registrant,
it
is
required
to
notify
him
that
he
has
30
days
within
which
to
request
a
personal
appearance
before
his
local
board
or
to
take
an
appeal
to
the
state
appeal
board
and
that
there
is
a
government
appeal
agent
available
to
advice
him
fully
of
his
appeal
rights
and
assist
him
in
the
appeal
process.
at
a
personal
appearance,
the
registrant
may
discuss
his
classification
with
the
local
board
members
and
present
both
orally
and
in
writing
any
new
information,
he
believes
maybe
relevant
to
his
claim
and
a
written
record
of
the
appearance
is
placed
in
his
selective
service
file.
on
appeal
to
the
state
appeal
board,
the
registrant
may
specify
in
writing
the
matters
in
which
he
believes
the
local
board
erred
or
which
he
believes
it
failed
to
consider.
the
state
appeal
board's
consideration
is
de
novo
based
on
its
independent
review
of
the
registrant
selective
service
file.
it's
classification
is
one
of
first
instance,
not
a
mere
affirmance
or
reversal
of
the
local
board.
moreover,
if
the
information
in
the
registrant
selective
service
file
is
not
sufficient
to
unable
the
appeal
board
to
determine
the
proper
classification.
the
appeal
board
is
required
by
the
regulations
to
return
the
file
to
the
local
board
for
additional
information
or
action.
from
the
final
decision
by
the
state
appeal
board
an
appeal
maybe
taken
to
the
national
board
if
one,
the
state
appeal
board
had
been
divided
or
two,
even
had
not
it
been
divided,
if
the
national
or
state
director
is
asked
by
the
registrant
to
take
the
case
to
the
national
board
on
his
behalf
and
a
question
of
some
importance
appears
to
be
involved.
no
registrant
can
be
ordered
to
report
for
induction
while
his
classification
is
being
considered
by
the
local
and
appeal
boards.
now,
while
a
registrant
is
nowhere
required
in
the
statute
or
regulations
to
seek
an
administrative
review
of
his
local
board
classification,
the
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedy's
principle
seems
implicit
in
the
entire
statutory
scheme.
when
congress
in
1967
added
to
section
10
(b)
(3),
the
provision
generally
prohibiting
judicial
review
of
classification
and
processing
questions
until
after
the
registrant
has
responded
either
affirmatively
or
negatively
to
an
order
to
report
for
induction.
the
legislative
history
reflects
clearly
that
the
intent
was
to
commit
the
resolution
of
such
questions
in
the
first
instance
to
the
discretion
and
expertise
of
the
local
and
appeal
boards.
and
this
intent,
it
seems
to
us
was
underscored
in
this
court's
recent
decisions
in
oestereich
and
clark
v,
gabriel,
defining
the
narrow
scope
of
pre-induction
judicial
review
under
section
10
(b)
(3)
that
is
available
to
registrants
who
have
exhausted
their
administrative
appeal
remedies
and
it
seem
to
be
central
to
the
unanimous
decision
of
the
court
on
a
last
term
in
malloy.
of
course,
as
stated
in
the
mckart
case,
the
exhaustion
doctrine
must
be
tailored
to
fit
the
peculiarities
of
the
administrative
system
which
congress
and
the
president
have
created
and
thus
where,
as
in
mckart,
the
classification
is
not
one
requiring
administrative
discretion
and
expertise,
but
turns
instead
on
statutory
interpretation,
there
is
generally
good
reason
to
exhaust
the
exhaustion
principle,
to
require
further
resort
to
local
and
appeal
boards
which
are
concededly
ill-suited
to
the
task
of
coping
with
such
pure
questions
of
law
which
serve
no
real
purpose.
similarly,
if
the
local
board's
action
is
challenged
on
strict
constitutional
grounds
as
was
the
situation
in
the
wolff
case
in
the
second
circuit,
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
might
not
be
necessary.
in
that
case
the
second
circuit
declined
to
invoke
the
doctrine,
to
preclude
judicial
review
of
delinquency
re-classifications
assigned
to
registrants
for
sitting
in
at
their
draft
boards.
and
the
reason
given
was
that
the
action
by
the
local
board
raises
significant
first
amendment
questions
under
this
court's
decision
in
dombrowski.
nor
would
it
seem
is
the
doctrine,
so
wouldn't
as
to
require
its
application
where
a
registrant
he
can
show
he
was
physically
unable
to
exhaust
or
he
can
show
some
other
special
or
unusual
circumstances
which
justified
his
failure
to
exhaust.
and
i
think
in
this
connection
it's
instructed
to
point
out
that
the
case
mcneel
v.
united
states,
a
conscientious
objector
case
which
was
remanded
to
the
district
court
after
mckart
for
a
further
consideration
in
light
of
this
court's
decision
in
mckart.
in
that
case,
judge
merrick
of
the
eastern
district
of
virginia,
he
relaxed
the
exhaustion
principle
on
the
ground
that
there
were
in
that
case
special
circumstances
in
his
words,
that
is
that
the
registrant
was
apparently
--
that
the
registrant
apparently
lacked
any
comprehension
of
his
administrative
rights
under
the
administrative
appeal
procedure.
however,
we
do
not
consider
the
instant
case
to
be
within
any
of
these
exceptions.
at
the
outset,
petitioner's
efforts
to
bring
the
case
within
the
mckart
rational
on
the
ground
that
the
local
board
failed
to
consider
his
conscientious
objector
claim
is
simply
not
supported
by
this
record.
while
there's
some
ambiguity
in
the
board
chairman's
testimony
as
to
whether
the
claim
was
in
march
1966
at
the
time
petitioner
held
the
student-deferment
whether
it
was
considered
at
that
time,
the
record
clearly
establishes
that
petitioner's
entire
file
was
reviewed
and
considered
by
the
full
board
prior
to
reclassification
in
september
1967,
that's
when
he
got
his
i-a
classification
from
the
ii-s
classification
and
the
district
court
found
as
a
fact
that
the
claim
had
been
fully
considered
as
did
the
majority
below.
but
i
think
the
essential
point
here
is
that
even
had
the
local
board
failed
to
consider
the
claim,
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
mckart
would
not
be
controlling.
it
is
undisputed
that
the
local
board's
action
in
september
1967
was
not
in
response
to
the
letter
petitioner
wrote
to
the
president
on
april
15,
1967.
that
is,
we
do
not
have
here
in
instance
of
unlawful
reclassification
by
the
local
board
in
the
oestereich
and
breen
sense.
at
most,
we
have
a
situation
where
the
board,
in
march
of
1966,
did
not
actually
consider
the
claim
because
petitioner
at
that
time
had
a
lower
ii-s
classification.
and
then
in
september
1967,
the
board
mistakenly
believing
that
it
earlier
considered
the
claim
and
finding
no
new
information
in
the
file
relating
to
the
claim,
based
its
denial
on
what
it
thought
to
be
a
prior
determination
on
the
merits.
it
is
our
view
that
is
precisely
the
type
of
procedural
error,
had
then
in
fact
been
the
case,
which
congress
and
the
president
anticipated
at
the
time
they
constructed
the
elaborate
appeal
machinery
within
the
system.
plainly,
a
personal
appearance
would
have
corrected
such
a
mistake.
an
appeal
to
the
state
appeal
board
which
is
required
to
consider
petitioner's
file
de
novo
would
certainly
have
cured
the
mistake.
nothing
here,
suggests
that
such
as
a
course
would
have
been
a
futile
exercise.
unlike
mckart,
the
administrative
determination
to
petitioner's
conscientious
objector
claim
was
not
a
matter
solely
a
statutory
interpretation.
there
was
no
statement
here
by
the
state
director
as
there
was
in
the
mckart
that
he
was
predisposed
to
deny
petitioner's
claim.
moreover,
we
are
not
here
dealing
with
a
classification
question
where
this
court
can
determine
with
any
certainty
as
it
could
in
the
mckart
that
petitioner
is
entitled
to
an
exemption
as
a
matter
of
law.
here,
the
claim
is
to
conscientious
objector
status.
such
a
claim
by
its
very
nature
calls
for
the
type
of
factual
determinations
which
congress
has
said,
should
in
the
first
instance,
be
left
to
the
discretion
and
special
expertise
of
local
and
appeal
boards.
moreover,
it
is
one
of
the
few
claims
that
does
not
turn
exclusively
on
the
registrant's
written
submissions.
it
is
undisputed
that
petitioner
made
out
a
prima
facie
case
for
exemption
in
his
special
conscientious
objector
form.
but
as
this
court
recognized
in
the
witmer
case
and
again
in
seeger,
there
is
also
the
substantial
question
of
petitioner's
sincerity.
here,
the
local
board
which
did
consider
the
claim
may
have
thought
the
petitioner
was
insincere
perhaps
because
he
claimed
to
have
always
then
a
religious
conscientious
objector
and
yet
in
august
1964,
at
the
time
when
he
held
the
i-a
classification,
he
expressed
some
willingness
to
submit
to
induction
or
perhaps
because
his
letter
to
the
president
was
read
by
the
local
board
as
reflecting
an
objection
to
the
government's
policies
in
vietnam
and
the
board
might
have
thought
that
this
was
the
real
basis
for
his
claim.
whatever
the
basis
for
the
local
board's
denial
in
this
case,
we
think
it
is
clear
that
the
administrative
system
never
had
an
opportunity
to
examine
the
sincerity
of
petitioner's
professed
beliefs.
perhaps
as
petitioner
suggests,
if
the
local
board
doubted
his
sincerity,
the
better
approach
would
have
been
to
call
him
in
for
an
interview
prior
to
reclassification,
but
the
law
does
not
require
local
boards
to
do
this.
moreover,
in
view
of
petitioner's
letter
to
the
president
and
his
subsequent
statement
to
the
local
board
that
he
would
return
all
correspondence
from
the
system
unopened,
both
of
which
took
place
prior
to
the
time
that
the
local
board
considered
his
claim
in
september
1967.
it
seems
to
us
unlikely,
that
the
petitioner
would've
appeared
even
if
the
local
board
had
made
such
a
request.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
he
did
not
send
himself
a
copy,
but
it
was
routed
to
the
local
board,
your
honor,
yes.
the
local
board
did
receive
it
but
it
did
not
come
directly
from
the
petitioner,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
believe
that
that
was
a
sealed
letter.
i
believe
that
the
selective
service
system
sends
all
their
orders
in
sealed
envelops
with
their
stamp
on
the
corner
in
a
window.
the
essential
point
your
honor
is
that
the
selective
service
laws
place
the
burden
on
the
registrant
to
prove
his
sincerity.
had
petitioner
requested
a
personal
interview,
perhaps,
he
could
have
lay
to
rest
any
doubts
that
the
local
board
might
if
have
in
this
regard.
had
he
taken
an
appeal
to
the
state
appeal
board,
perhaps
it
would've
read
petitioner's
file
differently
than
the
local
board
and
granted
the
exemption
or
it
might
have
found
the
information
in
the
file
insufficient
and
send
it
back
to
the
local
board
with
instructions
to
call
petitioner
for
an
interview.
what
we
are
saying
is,
if
the
local
board
did
in
fact
commit
error
in
the
classification
of
the
petitioner,
it
was
precisely
the
type
of
error
within
the
competence
of
the
administrative
agency
to
correct,
but
petitioner
has
chosen
deliberately
to
bypass
the
administrative
appeal
machinery.
whatever
his
reasons,
he
is
willfully
adopted
a
position
of
total
non-cooperation
with
the
system,
a
choice
he
made
prior
to
the
time
that
the
board
gave
final
consideration
to
his
claim
on
the
merits.
thus,
there
has
been
no
opportunity
for
the
local
and
appeal
board
to
consider
fully
the
sincerity
of
his
professed
beliefs.
if
the
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
is
not
required
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
operation
of
a
selective
service
system
could
be
seriously
and
effectively
disrupted
by
others
who
might
choose
deliberately
to
bypass
this
elaborate
administrative
machinery
that
congress
and
the
president
have
established.
they
would
then
be
able
to
submit
to
their
local
board's
well-drafted
conscientious
objector
claims,
followed
shortly
by
a
letter,
advising
the
board
that
their
opposition
is
so
strong
that
they
no
longer
can
cooperate
with
the
system.
their
cases
then
come
to
the
courts
in
the
same
posture
as
the
instant
case
without
anyone
having
an
opportunity
to
pass
directly
on
the
sincerity
of
their
professed
beliefs.
since
the
courts
are
not
permitted
under
this
court's
ruling
in
gibson
to
receive
additional
evidence
on
this
question,
it
seems
to
us
they
would
have
no
choice,
following
the
estep
standard
which
is
now
in
statute
but
to
dismiss
a
criminal
prosecution
for
refusal
to
submit
on
the
ground
that
the
registrant
selective
service
file,
that
is
the
documents
which
were
before
the
board
shows
no
basis
in
fact
for
denial
of
the
prime
facie
written
claim.
we
are
not
suggesting
that
the
sincere
registrants
who
are
genuinely
opposed
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form
are
likely
to
run
to
this
procedure.
as
pointed
out
in
mckart,
it
seems
unlikely
that
they
will
risk
criminal
conviction
before
taking
all
possible
steps
within
the
system
to
obtain
an
exemption
or
deferment.
but
in
our
view
the
exhaustion
requirement
is
not
need
for
such
registrants.
it
is
needed
instead
to
cope
with
the
recusant
registrant
who
refuses
for
reasons
best
known
to
him
to
cooperate
with
the
system
in
any
way,
who
quite
often
is
more
intent
on
disrupting
the
operation
of
the
system
than
obtaining
an
exemption?
it
seems
to
us
that
he
should
not
be
allowed
to
sit
back
and
ignore
the
administrative
processes
with
impunity
while
others
are
being
called
up
to
serve
in
his
place.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that's
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
your
honor
in
our
view,
the
board
was
not
on
constructive
notice
of
the
claim.
i
think
our
principle
response
is
that
with
respect
to
the
divinity
claim,
petitioner
not
only
failed
to
exhaust
his
administrative
remedies,
he
did
not
even
invoke
them
in
the
first
place
and
courts
do
not
have
under
the
statute,
plenary
review
of
classification
questions,
but
are
explicitly
limited
to
determining
whether
the
action
of
the
administrative
agency
is
without
any
basis
in
fact.
but
even
if
we
assume
that
the
board
had
constructive
notice
and
even
if
we
assume
that
the
facts
that
petitioner
rely
on
a
trial
because
the
district
court
did
except
evidence
on
this
point,
even
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
except
that
judge
feinberg
did
state
your
honor
that
his
position
would
be
entirely
different
even
with
respect
to
the
conscientious
objector
claim
if
there
have
been
no
tendering
of
a
claim
in
the
first
instance
to
the
local
board.
and
i
would
also
add
that
even
on
the
facts
presented,
this
petitioner
was
not
entitled
to
such
an
exemption,
that's
the
factual
question.
the
courts
looked
at
that
and
there
was
no
showing
that
he
met
the
statutory
standard,
that
his
studies,
that
he
himself
as
student
studies
were
under
the
direction
of
a
recognized
church
or
theological
institution.
he
was
attending
union
theological
seminary,
but
there
is
no
evidence
that
he
was
there
under
the
direction
of
a
church
or
religious
organization.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
don't
believe
at
the
time
that
the
case
in
the
district
court
that
he
had
completed
his
studies,
whether
he
now
has
one
or
not
i
don't
know.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
if
we
lose
this
one,
your
honor,
i
do
think
that
as
to
the
other
counts
the
petitioner
was
properly
convicted
for
the
deliberate
non-performance
of
duties
recently
imposed
on
him
under
the
laws.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
no
your
honor,
they
did
not.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
not
on
the
other
counts,
no
your
honor.
they
were
discussed
by
the
dissenting
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
no,
they
do
not.
in
our
view,
they
don't.
as
to
the
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
believe
the
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
they
--
one
or
two
--
the
argument
in
one
or
two
or
the
other
counts
hinged
on
the
fact
that
he
had
been
classified
i-a.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
but
i
don't
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
addressed
itself
to
the
other
issues
because
they
found
that
he
was
guilty
on
the
first
count
and
under
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
in
his
discretion
it
is
permitted.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that's
correct
on
that
count
but
they
did
not
reach
that
question.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
believe
if
we
lose
on
a
first
issue
you
could
properly
remand
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
pass
on.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
don't
think
that
this
court
needs
to
do
that.
i
will
address
a
comment
or
two
to
each
of
the
other
ones.
i
believe
that
they
were
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
they
were
proper,
but
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
itself
address
its
attention
to
that.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
two-year
sentence
was
based
primarily
on
the
first
count
and
i
do
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
is
our
position
in
our
brief
your
honor
and
i
believe
that
is
appropriate.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that's
correct.
but
at
the
same
time
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
we
are
not
urging
a
two-year
sentence
if
we
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
no,
your
honor
that's
not
what
we
are
urging.
but
the
other
counts
are
briefed
and
before
the
court.
i
think
that
conviction
on
those
points
was
proper.
the
failure
to
report
to
his
pre-induction
physical
examination,
petitioner
justified
that
on
the
fact
that
because
he
was
classified
i-a
improperly,
he
was
under
no
obligation
to
obey
the
intermediate
directives
of
a
local
board.
i
don't
believe
that
this
argument
can
be
sustained.
the
pre-induction
physical
examination
is
for
the
purpose
of
assuring
the
local
board
that
a
registrant
is
physically
qualified
and
available
for
induction
prior
to
the
time
that
it
issues
its
induction
order
in
order
to
fill
its
call.
the
induction
which
petitioner
under
went
at
the
station
is
a
much
more
--
a
much
shorter
examination
and
it
is
merely
to
determine
the
changes
in
his
physical
status
from
the
time
of
his
earlier
pre-induction
physical.
and
therefore,
it's
our
view
that
does
not
absolve
his
failure
to
report
to
the
selective
service
pre-induction
physical.
he
argues
that
his
notice
of
classification
was
invalid
because
his
assigned
classification
was
invalid,
in
our
view,
to
qualify
or
valid
and
the
regulation
relates
to
anything
to
--
does
not
relate
to
anything
other
than
the
certificate
itself,
that
it
be
authentic
and
properly
executed
and
petitioner
does
not
contest
the
fact
that
his
notice
of
classification
fully
met
these
requirements
and
finally
on
the
information
questionnaire,
the
categorical
language
of
the
regulation
violated,
provides
that
each
registrant
shall
submit
to
his
local
board
in
writing
all
information
which
the
local
board
may
at
any
time
request
from
him.
petitioner
concedes
that
his
failure
to
respond
to
the
current
information
questionnaire
undoubtedly
violated
this
language
and
we
believe
there
is
no
good
excuse,
no
good
reason
to
excuse
the
violation.
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
a
minor
lapse,
but
with
a
flat
defiance
of
a
reasonable
request
for
information
not
readily
available
to
the
local
board
otherwise
in
which
petitioner
never
provided
to
it.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
the
cases
of
falbo
and
estep,
read
together
fairly
established
that
the
principle
of
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
does
have
a
place
in
criminal
actions
brought
under
the
selective
service
laws
and
that
general
concept
was
not
under
attack
in
the
recent
mckart
and
duvernay
cases.
they
involve
instead,
exceptional
circumstances,
set
to
warrant
a
relaxation
of
the
doctrine
on
particular
facts
presented.
petitioner
seeks
to
have
this
court
overrule
falbo,
estep
and
their
progeny,
primarily
because
as
i
understand
the
argument,
he
come
before
the
courts
not
as
a
plaintiff
seeking
affirmative
relief,
but
as
a
defendant
charged
with
a
criminal
offense.
at
the
outset,
it
seems
that
if
an
application
of
the
exhaustion
doctrine
were
to
turn
on
such
a
distinction,
the
effect
would
be
in
essence
to
penalize
the
registrant
who
after
failing
to
exercise
his
administrative
remedies
decides
to
obey
the
law
and
submit
to
induction,
seeking
affirmative
relief
in
the
courts
through
a
habeas
corpus
action.
he
would,
under
petitioner's
theory,
be
precluded
by
the
exhaustion
doctrine
from
challenging
his
classification.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
same
registrant
had
decided
to
violate
the
law
and
he
then
been
criminally
prosecuted,
petitioner
maintains
that
he
cannot
similarly
be
barred
from
raising
the
same
claim
as
a
defense.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that's
correct,
your
honor,
assuming
the
--
if
a
criminal
prosecution
filed
and
he
did
(inaudible).
we
do
not
think
the
exhaustion
doctrine
was
ever
intended
to
be
applied
in
a
manner
which
would
encourage
registrants
to
refuse
induction
and
discourage
them
from
complying
with
the
law
and
testing
their
classification
in
habeas
corpus
proceedings.
moreover,
to
insist
that
the
exhaustion
doctrine
cannot
be
invoked
under
any
circumstances
in
criminal
prosecutions
under
the
selective
service
laws,
is
to
ignore
the
statutory
scheme
on
which
this
court
has
based
its
earlier
decisions
in
this
area.
congress
and
the
president
have
carefully
constructed
a
very
comprehensive
and
fair
administrative
appeal
process
within
the
selective
service
system.
at
the
time
a
local
board
classifies
a
registrant,
it
is
required
to
notify
him
that
he
has
30
days
within
which
to
request
a
personal
appearance
before
his
local
board
or
to
take
an
appeal
to
the
state
appeal
board
and
that
there
is
a
government
appeal
agent
available
to
advice
him
fully
of
his
appeal
rights
and
assist
him
in
the
appeal
process.
at
a
personal
appearance,
the
registrant
may
discuss
his
classification
with
the
local
board
members
and
present
both
orally
and
in
writing
any
new
information,
he
believes
maybe
relevant
to
his
claim
and
a
written
record
of
the
appearance
is
placed
in
his
selective
service
file.
on
appeal
to
the
state
appeal
board,
the
registrant
may
specify
in
writing
the
matters
in
which
he
believes
the
local
board
erred
or
which
he
believes
it
failed
to
consider.
the
state
appeal
board's
consideration
is
de
novo
based
on
its
independent
review
of
the
registrant
selective
service
file.
it's
classification
is
one
of
first
instance,
not
a
mere
affirmance
or
reversal
of
the
local
board.
moreover,
if
the
information
in
the
registrant
selective
service
file
is
not
sufficient
to
unable
the
appeal
board
to
determine
the
proper
classification.
the
appeal
board
is
required
by
the
regulations
to
return
the
file
to
the
local
board
for
additional
information
or
action.
from
the
final
decision
by
the
state
appeal
board
an
appeal
maybe
taken
to
the
national
board
if
one,
the
state
appeal
board
had
been
divided
or
two,
even
had
not
it
been
divided,
if
the
national
or
state
director
is
asked
by
the
registrant
to
take
the
case
to
the
national
board
on
his
behalf
and
a
question
of
some
importance
appears
to
be
involved.
no
registrant
can
be
ordered
to
report
for
induction
while
his
classification
is
being
considered
by
the
local
and
appeal
boards.
now,
while
a
registrant
is
nowhere
required
in
the
statute
or
regulations
to
seek
an
administrative
review
of
his
local
board
classification,
the
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedy's
principle
seems
implicit
in
the
entire
statutory
scheme.
when
congress
in
1967
added
to
section
10
(b)
(3),
the
provision
generally
prohibiting
judicial
review
of
classification
and
processing
questions
until
after
the
registrant
has
responded
either
affirmatively
or
negatively
to
an
order
to
report
for
induction.
the
legislative
history
reflects
clearly
that
the
intent
was
to
commit
the
resolution
of
such
questions
in
the
first
instance
to
the
discretion
and
expertise
of
the
local
and
appeal
boards.
and
this
intent,
it
seems
to
us
was
underscored
in
this
court's
recent
decisions
in
oestereich
and
clark
v,
gabriel,
defining
the
narrow
scope
of
pre-induction
judicial
review
under
section
10
(b)
(3)
that
is
available
to
registrants
who
have
exhausted
their
administrative
appeal
remedies
and
it
seem
to
be
central
to
the
unanimous
decision
of
the
court
on
a
last
term
in
malloy.
of
course,
as
stated
in
the
mckart
case,
the
exhaustion
doctrine
must
be
tailored
to
fit
the
peculiarities
of
the
administrative
system
which
congress
and
the
president
have
created
and
thus
where,
as
in
mckart,
the
classification
is
not
one
requiring
administrative
discretion
and
expertise,
but
turns
instead
on
statutory
interpretation,
there
is
generally
good
reason
to
exhaust
the
exhaustion
principle,
to
require
further
resort
to
local
and
appeal
boards
which
are
concededly
ill-suited
to
the
task
of
coping
with
such
pure
questions
of
law
which
serve
no
real
purpose.
similarly,
if
the
local
board's
action
is
challenged
on
strict
constitutional
grounds
as
was
the
situation
in
the
wolff
case
in
the
second
circuit,
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
might
not
be
necessary.
in
that
case
the
second
circuit
declined
to
invoke
the
doctrine,
to
preclude
judicial
review
of
delinquency
re-classifications
assigned
to
registrants
for
sitting
in
at
their
draft
boards.
and
the
reason
given
was
that
the
action
by
the
local
board
raises
significant
first
amendment
questions
under
this
court's
decision
in
dombrowski.
nor
would
it
seem
is
the
doctrine,
so
wouldn't
as
to
require
its
application
where
a
registrant
he
can
show
he
was
physically
unable
to
exhaust
or
he
can
show
some
other
special
or
unusual
circumstances
which
justified
his
failure
to
exhaust.
and
i
think
in
this
connection
it's
instructed
to
point
out
that
the
case
mcneel
v.
united
states,
a
conscientious
objector
case
which
was
remanded
to
the
district
court
after
mckart
for
a
further
consideration
in
light
of
this
court's
decision
in
mckart.
in
that
case,
judge
merrick
of
the
eastern
district
of
virginia,
he
relaxed
the
exhaustion
principle
on
the
ground
that
there
were
in
that
case
special
circumstances
in
his
words,
that
is
that
the
registrant
was
apparently
--
that
the
registrant
apparently
lacked
any
comprehension
of
his
administrative
rights
under
the
administrative
appeal
procedure.
however,
we
do
not
consider
the
instant
case
to
be
within
any
of
these
exceptions.
at
the
outset,
petitioner's
efforts
to
bring
the
case
within
the
mckart
rational
on
the
ground
that
the
local
board
failed
to
consider
his
conscientious
objector
claim
is
simply
not
supported
by
this
record.
while
there's
some
ambiguity
in
the
board
chairman's
testimony
as
to
whether
the
claim
was
in
march
1966
at
the
time
petitioner
held
the
student-deferment
whether
it
was
considered
at
that
time,
the
record
clearly
establishes
that
petitioner's
entire
file
was
reviewed
and
considered
by
the
full
board
prior
to
reclassification
in
september
1967,
that's
when
he
got
his
i-a
classification
from
the
ii-s
classification
and
the
district
court
found
as
a
fact
that
the
claim
had
been
fully
considered
as
did
the
majority
below.
but
i
think
the
essential
point
here
is
that
even
had
the
local
board
failed
to
consider
the
claim,
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
mckart
would
not
be
controlling.
it
is
undisputed
that
the
local
board's
action
in
september
1967
was
not
in
response
to
the
letter
petitioner
wrote
to
the
president
on
april
15,
1967.
that
is,
we
do
not
have
here
in
instance
of
unlawful
reclassification
by
the
local
board
in
the
oestereich
and
breen
sense.
at
most,
we
have
a
situation
where
the
board,
in
march
of
1966,
did
not
actually
consider
the
claim
because
petitioner
at
that
time
had
a
lower
ii-s
classification.
and
then
in
september
1967,
the
board
mistakenly
believing
that
it
earlier
considered
the
claim
and
finding
no
new
information
in
the
file
relating
to
the
claim,
based
its
denial
on
what
it
thought
to
be
a
prior
determination
on
the
merits.
it
is
our
view
that
is
precisely
the
type
of
procedural
error,
had
then
in
fact
been
the
case,
which
congress
and
the
president
anticipated
at
the
time
they
constructed
the
elaborate
appeal
machinery
within
the
system.
plainly,
a
personal
appearance
would
have
corrected
such
a
mistake.
an
appeal
to
the
state
appeal
board
which
is
required
to
consider
petitioner's
file
de
novo
would
certainly
have
cured
the
mistake.
nothing
here,
suggests
that
such
as
a
course
would
have
been
a
futile
exercise.
unlike
mckart,
the
administrative
determination
to
petitioner's
conscientious
objector
claim
was
not
a
matter
solely
a
statutory
interpretation.
there
was
no
statement
here
by
the
state
director
as
there
was
in
the
mckart
that
he
was
predisposed
to
deny
petitioner's
claim.
moreover,
we
are
not
here
dealing
with
a
classification
question
where
this
court
can
determine
with
any
certainty
as
it
could
in
the
mckart
that
petitioner
is
entitled
to
an
exemption
as
a
matter
of
law.
here,
the
claim
is
to
conscientious
objector
status.
such
a
claim
by
its
very
nature
calls
for
the
type
of
factual
determinations
which
congress
has
said,
should
in
the
first
instance,
be
left
to
the
discretion
and
special
expertise
of
local
and
appeal
boards.
moreover,
it
is
one
of
the
few
claims
that
does
not
turn
exclusively
on
the
registrant's
written
submissions.
it
is
undisputed
that
petitioner
made
out
a
prima
facie
case
for
exemption
in
his
special
conscientious
objector
form.
but
as
this
court
recognized
in
the
witmer
case
and
again
in
seeger,
there
is
also
the
substantial
question
of
petitioner's
sincerity.
here,
the
local
board
which
did
consider
the
claim
may
have
thought
the
petitioner
was
insincere
perhaps
because
he
claimed
to
have
always
then
a
religious
conscientious
objector
and
yet
in
august
1964,
at
the
time
when
he
held
the
i-a
classification,
he
expressed
some
willingness
to
submit
to
induction
or
perhaps
because
his
letter
to
the
president
was
read
by
the
local
board
as
reflecting
an
objection
to
the
government's
policies
in
vietnam
and
the
board
might
have
thought
that
this
was
the
real
basis
for
his
claim.
whatever
the
basis
for
the
local
board's
denial
in
this
case,
we
think
it
is
clear
that
the
administrative
system
never
had
an
opportunity
to
examine
the
sincerity
of
petitioner's
professed
beliefs.
perhaps
as
petitioner
suggests,
if
the
local
board
doubted
his
sincerity,
the
better
approach
would
have
been
to
call
him
in
for
an
interview
prior
to
reclassification,
but
the
law
does
not
require
local
boards
to
do
this.
moreover,
in
view
of
petitioner's
letter
to
the
president
and
his
subsequent
statement
to
the
local
board
that
he
would
return
all
correspondence
from
the
system
unopened,
both
of
which
took
place
prior
to
the
time
that
the
local
board
considered
his
claim
in
september
1967.
it
seems
to
us
unlikely,
that
the
petitioner
would've
appeared
even
if
the
local
board
had
made
such
a
request.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
he
did
not
send
himself
a
copy,
but
it
was
routed
to
the
local
board,
your
honor,
yes.
the
local
board
did
receive
it
but
it
did
not
come
directly
from
the
petitioner,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
believe
that
that
was
a
sealed
letter.
i
believe
that
the
selective
service
system
sends
all
their
orders
in
sealed
envelops
with
their
stamp
on
the
corner
in
a
window.
the
essential
point
your
honor
is
that
the
selective
service
laws
place
the
burden
on
the
registrant
to
prove
his
sincerity.
had
petitioner
requested
a
personal
interview,
perhaps,
he
could
have
lay
to
rest
any
doubts
that
the
local
board
might
if
have
in
this
regard.
had
he
taken
an
appeal
to
the
state
appeal
board,
perhaps
it
would've
read
petitioner's
file
differently
than
the
local
board
and
granted
the
exemption
or
it
might
have
found
the
information
in
the
file
insufficient
and
send
it
back
to
the
local
board
with
instructions
to
call
petitioner
for
an
interview.
what
we
are
saying
is,
if
the
local
board
did
in
fact
commit
error
in
the
classification
of
the
petitioner,
it
was
precisely
the
type
of
error
within
the
competence
of
the
administrative
agency
to
correct,
but
petitioner
has
chosen
deliberately
to
bypass
the
administrative
appeal
machinery.
whatever
his
reasons,
he
is
willfully
adopted
a
position
of
total
non-cooperation
with
the
system,
a
choice
he
made
prior
to
the
time
that
the
board
gave
final
consideration
to
his
claim
on
the
merits.
thus,
there
has
been
no
opportunity
for
the
local
and
appeal
board
to
consider
fully
the
sincerity
of
his
professed
beliefs.
if
the
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
is
not
required
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
operation
of
a
selective
service
system
could
be
seriously
and
effectively
disrupted
by
others
who
might
choose
deliberately
to
bypass
this
elaborate
administrative
machinery
that
congress
and
the
president
have
established.
they
would
then
be
able
to
submit
to
their
local
board's
well-drafted
conscientious
objector
claims,
followed
shortly
by
a
letter,
advising
the
board
that
their
opposition
is
so
strong
that
they
no
longer
can
cooperate
with
the
system.
their
cases
then
come
to
the
courts
in
the
same
posture
as
the
instant
case
without
anyone
having
an
opportunity
to
pass
directly
on
the
sincerity
of
their
professed
beliefs.
since
the
courts
are
not
permitted
under
this
court's
ruling
in
gibson
to
receive
additional
evidence
on
this
question,
it
seems
to
us
they
would
have
no
choice,
following
the
estep
standard
which
is
now
in
statute
but
to
dismiss
a
criminal
prosecution
for
refusal
to
submit
on
the
ground
that
the
registrant
selective
service
file,
that
is
the
documents
which
were
before
the
board
shows
no
basis
in
fact
for
denial
of
the
prime
facie
written
claim.
we
are
not
suggesting
that
the
sincere
registrants
who
are
genuinely
opposed
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form
are
likely
to
run
to
this
procedure.
as
pointed
out
in
mckart,
it
seems
unlikely
that
they
will
risk
criminal
conviction
before
taking
all
possible
steps
within
the
system
to
obtain
an
exemption
or
deferment.
but
in
our
view
the
exhaustion
requirement
is
not
need
for
such
registrants.
it
is
needed
instead
to
cope
with
the
recusant
registrant
who
refuses
for
reasons
best
known
to
him
to
cooperate
with
the
system
in
any
way,
who
quite
often
is
more
intent
on
disrupting
the
operation
of
the
system
than
obtaining
an
exemption?
it
seems
to
us
that
he
should
not
be
allowed
to
sit
back
and
ignore
the
administrative
processes
with
impunity
while
others
are
being
called
up
to
serve
in
his
place.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that's
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
your
honor
in
our
view,
the
board
was
not
on
constructive
notice
of
the
claim.
i
think
our
principle
response
is
that
with
respect
to
the
divinity
claim,
petitioner
not
only
failed
to
exhaust
his
administrative
remedies,
he
did
not
even
invoke
them
in
the
first
place
and
courts
do
not
have
under
the
statute,
plenary
review
of
classification
questions,
but
are
explicitly
limited
to
determining
whether
the
action
of
the
administrative
agency
is
without
any
basis
in
fact.
but
even
if
we
assume
that
the
board
had
constructive
notice
and
even
if
we
assume
that
the
facts
that
petitioner
rely
on
a
trial
because
the
district
court
did
except
evidence
on
this
point,
even
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
except
that
judge
feinberg
did
state
your
honor
that
his
position
would
be
entirely
different
even
with
respect
to
the
conscientious
objector
claim
if
there
have
been
no
tendering
of
a
claim
in
the
first
instance
to
the
local
board.
and
i
would
also
add
that
even
on
the
facts
presented,
this
petitioner
was
not
entitled
to
such
an
exemption,
that's
the
factual
question.
the
courts
looked
at
that
and
there
was
no
showing
that
he
met
the
statutory
standard,
that
his
studies,
that
he
himself
as
student
studies
were
under
the
direction
of
a
recognized
church
or
theological
institution.
he
was
attending
union
theological
seminary,
but
there
is
no
evidence
that
he
was
there
under
the
direction
of
a
church
or
religious
organization.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
don't
believe
at
the
time
that
the
case
in
the
district
court
that
he
had
completed
his
studies,
whether
he
now
has
one
or
not
i
don't
know.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
if
we
lose
this
one,
your
honor,
i
do
think
that
as
to
the
other
counts
the
petitioner
was
properly
convicted
for
the
deliberate
non-performance
of
duties
recently
imposed
on
him
under
the
laws.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
no
your
honor,
they
did
not.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
not
on
the
other
counts,
no
your
honor.
they
were
discussed
by
the
dissenting
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
no,
they
do
not.
in
our
view,
they
don't.
as
to
the
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
believe
the
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
they
--
one
or
two
--
the
argument
in
one
or
two
or
the
other
counts
hinged
on
the
fact
that
he
had
been
classified
i-a.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
but
i
don't
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
addressed
itself
to
the
other
issues
because
they
found
that
he
was
guilty
on
the
first
count
and
under
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
in
his
discretion
it
is
permitted.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that's
correct
on
that
count
but
they
did
not
reach
that
question.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
believe
if
we
lose
on
a
first
issue
you
could
properly
remand
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
pass
on.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
don't
think
that
this
court
needs
to
do
that.
i
will
address
a
comment
or
two
to
each
of
the
other
ones.
i
believe
that
they
were
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
they
were
proper,
but
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
itself
address
its
attention
to
that.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
two-year
sentence
was
based
primarily
on
the
first
count
and
i
do
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
is
our
position
in
our
brief
your
honor
and
i
believe
that
is
appropriate.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that's
correct.
but
at
the
same
time
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
we
are
not
urging
a
two-year
sentence
if
we
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
no,
your
honor
that's
not
what
we
are
urging.
but
the
other
counts
are
briefed
and
before
the
court.
i
think
that
conviction
on
those
points
was
proper.
the
failure
to
report
to
his
pre-induction
physical
examination,
petitioner
justified
that
on
the
fact
that
because
he
was
classified
i-a
improperly,
he
was
under
no
obligation
to
obey
the
intermediate
directives
of
a
local
board.
i
don't
believe
that
this
argument
can
be
sustained.
the
pre-induction
physical
examination
is
for
the
purpose
of
assuring
the
local
board
that
a
registrant
is
physically
qualified
and
available
for
induction
prior
to
the
time
that
it
issues
its
induction
order
in
order
to
fill
its
call.
the
induction
which
petitioner
under
went
at
the
station
is
a
much
more
--
a
much
shorter
examination
and
it
is
merely
to
determine
the
changes
in
his
physical
status
from
the
time
of
his
earlier
pre-induction
physical.
and
therefore,
it's
our
view
that
does
not
absolve
his
failure
to
report
to
the
selective
service
pre-induction
physical.
he
argues
that
his
notice
of
classification
was
invalid
because
his
assigned
classification
was
invalid,
in
our
view,
to
qualify
or
valid
and
the
regulation
relates
to
anything
to
--
does
not
relate
to
anything
other
than
the
certificate
itself,
that
it
be
authentic
and
properly
executed
and
petitioner
does
not
contest
the
fact
that
his
notice
of
classification
fully
met
these
requirements
and
finally
on
the
information
questionnaire,
the
categorical
language
of
the
regulation
violated,
provides
that
each
registrant
shall
submit
to
his
local
board
in
writing
all
information
which
the
local
board
may
at
any
time
request
from
him.
petitioner
concedes
that
his
failure
to
respond
to
the
current
information
questionnaire
undoubtedly
violated
this
language
and
we
believe
there
is
no
good
excuse,
no
good
reason
to
excuse
the
violation.
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
a
minor
lapse,
but
with
a
flat
defiance
of
a
reasonable
request
for
information
not
readily
available
to
the
local
board
otherwise
in
which
petitioner
never
provided
to
it.
