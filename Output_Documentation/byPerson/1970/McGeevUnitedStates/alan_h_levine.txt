mr.
alan
h.
levine
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
you
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
second
circuit.
the
petitioner
seeks
to
review
of
convictions
on
four
counts
under
the
military
selective
service
act
of
1967.
the
chief
question
presented
by
this
petition
is
the
question
left
open
in
mckart
versus
united
states.
it
presents
the
pure
question
of
whether
where
a
registrant
presents
a
claim
for
conscious
objection
and
that
claim
is
denied
without
a
basis
in
fact
as
the
second
circuit
concedes
here
it
was
so
denied,
and
where
therefore,
the
classification
--
i-a
classification
and
the
induction
order
were
illegal,
is
he
barred
from
challenging
that
classification
and
induction
order
in
judicial
review.
in
answering
that
question,
no,
we
will
assert
two
basic
propositions.
one
that
the
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
doctrine
is
inappropriately
applied,
whereas
mckart
suggested,
its
effect
is
not
merely
to
delay
judicial
review,
but
is
to
deny
it
completely
and
we
will
defend,
secondly,
the
proposition
that
if
the
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
is
to
be
applied
so
harshly.
it
must
be
applied
with
congressional
mandate
in
that
the
military
selective
service
act
of
1967
to
the
contrary,
does
not
limit
judicial
review
in
defense
to
a
criminal
prosecution,
but
in
fact
guarantees
judicial
review
in
defense
to
a
criminal
prosecution.
petitioner,
at
the
time
of
induction
was
a
full
time
student
at
union
theological
seminary.
he
had
registered
for
the
draft
in
august
of
1961
in
new
york
city.
he
had
advised
his
local
board
at
that
time
that
he
was
preparing
for
the
ministry.
in
august
of
1964,
he
enrolled
in
the
university
of
rochester
the
next
month
was
a
given
a
ii-s
deferment
for
all
practical
purposes
kept
that
deferment
until
september
of
1967.
in
february
1966
while
still
at
the
university
of
rochester
and
still
possessing
at
ii-s
classification,
he
applied
for
conscientious
objector
status.
pursuant
to
regulations,
the
local
board
deferred
consideration
of
that
application
until
he
was
no
longer
entitled
to
a
lower
classification.
in
march
of
1966,
he
got
a
letter
from
the
local
board
to
that
effect
that
they
would
defer
consideration
of
co
application.
in
april
of
1967,
still
at
rochester,
still
possessing
a
ii-s,
the
petitioner
wrote
the
president
of
the
united
states.
he
enclosed
in
that
letter
remnants
of
a
torn
and
burnt
draft
card.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
it
was
not
nor
was
he
indicted
in
indictments
under
review
here.
subsequent
to
the
trial
in
this
case,
he
was
indicted
on
two
counts
of
destroying
a
draft
card.
those
cases
have
not
come
to
trial,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
it
is
not
your
honor.
he
wrote
to
president
in
april
1967.
he
advised
the
president
that
he
would
probably
be
entitled
to
a
theological
deferment.
nevertheless,
he
said,
“i
must
sever
every
link
with
violence
and
war.”
he
expressed,
“the
fundamental
belief
that
man
must
build
and
not
destroy,
love
and
not
hate.”
as
a
result,
he
said
that
he
could
no
longer
cooperate
with
the
selective
service
system.
in
june
of
1967,
upon
his
graduation
from
rochester,
he
was
sent
a
current
information
questionnaire,
sss
form
127.
he
returned
that
questionnaire
unopened
and
said
that
he
would
return
all
future
correspondence
unopened.
in
september
of
1967,
he
was
classified
i-a
despite
his
pending
co
application.
he
returned
that
i-a
classification
card.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
that's
right
in
march
of
1966.
this
is
--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
no.
no,
this
is
september
1967
that
i'm
talking
about.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
right.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
in
march
of
1966.
the
board
chairman
testified
at
trial
somewhat
ambiguously
and
it
is
a
result
of
his
testimony
as
to
what
the
board
did
in
march
1966
and
september
1967
that
led
judge
feinberg
to
conclude
that
in
fact
the
board
had
never
considered
the
application
on
its
merits.
that
in
september
1967,
according
to
the
board
chairman's
testimony,
they
had
just
reaffirmed
their
earlier
decision.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
presumably
because
they
were
aware
from
his
earlier
request
for
ii-s
that
he
was
going
to
graduate
in
june
of
1967.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
it
was
a
current
information
form
and
--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
well,
the
board
had
before
his
claim
as
to
conscientious
objection.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
it
was
a
year
and
a
couple
of
months
before
that
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
well,
if
he
had
told
the
board
at
that
time
that
he
was
no
longer
entitled
to
ii-s,
presumably
in
the
course
of
normal
procedures,
the
board
would
have
considered
his
co
application
at
that
time.
this
current
information
questionnaire
does
not
contain
reference
to
conscientious
objection.
he
would
have
advised
them
i've
graduated,
i'm
entitled
--
i'm
no
longer
entitled
to
ii-s
and
therefore,
the
board
would
have
seen
in
his
file
that
he
had
a
pending
co
application.
presumably,
according
to
the
board
chairman's
somewhat
ambiguous
testimony
that
is
what
they
did
in
september
of
1967.
they
considered
his
entire
file
and
to
co
application.
as
i
said
judge
feinberg
thinks
that
they
did
not
consider
his
application
on
the
merits
at
all.
the
trial
judge,
however,
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
at
the
close
of
trial
that
the
application
had
been
considered.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
pardon?
and
rejected,
that's
correct.
petitioner
did
not
appeal
that
classification.
later
that
month,
he
enrolled
in
union
theological
seminary.
in
october
of
1967,
he
was
ordered
to
report
--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
he
did
send
it
back
unopened,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
presumably,
he
did
not.
he
sent
back
the
i-a
unopened,
later
that
month
enrolled
in
union
theological
seminary.
in
october
of
1967,
he
was
sent
an
order
to
report
for
physical
examination,
he
returned
that
order
unopened.
he
was
ordered
to
report
for
induction
in
january
of
1968,
he
filled
out
a
number
of
forms
giving
a
variety
of
different
kinds
of
information
at
that
time.
he
took
a
complete
physical
examination
--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
pardon?
mr.
alan
h.
levine
he
did
open
that
envelop.
he
reported
as
ordered
to
report.
he
gave
the
required
information.
he
took
the
required
physical
examination,
passed
the
physical
examination
and
refuse
to
submit
to
induction.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
it's
given
by
the
military
for
selective
service.
it's
given
at
the
arm
forces
entrance
examination.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
no,
this
was
at
the
time
of
induction.
his
file
was
then
forwarded
to
the
united
states'
attorney
significantly
with
a
recommendation
of
selective
service
that
he
be
indicted
only
on
two
counts,
refusal
of
induction
and
failure
to
possess
his
notice
of
classification.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
why
he
opened
the
--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
not
from
the
record,
your
honor.
i
did
not
represent
petitioner
at
that
time.
perhaps
he
spoke
to
legal
counsel
at
that
time.
i
do
not
know
and
the
record
does
not
indicate.
despite
the
recommendation
of
selective
service
that
he
be
prosecuted
on
two
counts,
in
february
of
1968,
the
government
sought
and
obtained
a
four-count
indictment.
the
first
count
was
the
refusal
of
induction;
the
second,
was
for
refusal
to
take
the
physical
examination;
the
third,
was
the
failure
to
possess
the
notice
of
classification
and
the
fourth,
for
failure
to
submit
the
information
requested
on
the
classification
from.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
they
are
generally
envelops,
i
believe
your
honor.
petitioner
was
found
guilty
in
january
of
1969
on
all
four
counts
and
sentenced
to
two-year
concurrent
sentences
on
each
count.
in
march
of
1970,
the
second
circuit
upheld
the
convictions,
judge
feinberg
dissenting.
the
three
judges
in
the
second
circuit
conceded
that
there
was
no
basis
in
fact
for
the
board
to
deny
petitioner's
conscientious
objector
claim.
nevertheless,
they
said
that
because
he
failed
to
exhaust
his
appeal
remedies
within
selective
service,
they
would
decline
to
review
the
classification.
we
point
out
first
that
the
1967
military
selective
service
act
of
1967
provides
for
review
of
classification
“as
a
defense
to
a
criminal
prosecution.”
it
does
not
qualify
that
right.
it
does
not
condition
it
on
exhausting
administrative
remedies.
it
says
rather
that
it
can
be
raised
and
review
can
be
had
after
a
registrant
has
responded
to
an
order
to
report
for
induction.
it's
important
to
note
your
honors
that
the
congress
had
before
it
the
entire
question
of
judicial
review.
it
is
not
an
inadvertence
that
this
aspect
of
judicial
review
is
stated
as
it
is.
they
had
it
before
it.
they
considered
the
question
of
judicial
review
and
limited
only
pre-induction
review.
the
question
before
this
court
in
oestereich
as
a
senate
arm
services
committee
said,
“if
the
registrant
does
not
submit
to
induction,
he
may
raise
as
a
defense
to
a
criminal
prosecution
the
issue
of
the
legality
of
the
classification.”
the
effect
of
that
act
is
to
guarantee
judicial
review
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
the
second
circuit
conceded
that
petitioner
was
unlawfully
classified.
implicitly,
it
conceded
that
he
was
sent
to
jail
for
two
years
or
it
has
been
ordered
to
jail
two
years
for
violating
an
illegal
order.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
that
is
correct,
they
deal
with
that
claim
and
i
will
touch
on
it
briefly,
but
the
major
issue
and
the
issue
upon
which
judge
feinberg
relied
in
dissent
was
the
conscientious
objector
issue.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
well,
let
me
say
briefly,
your
honor,
that
the
congressional
mandate
for
ministerial
deferments
under
6-g
is
i
say
--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
that's
right,
is
mandatory.
he
shall
be
deferred
assuming
he
meets
certain
qualification.
that's
full
time
attendance
under
the
direction
of
a
recognized
church.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
that
is
correct.
now,
mcgee
presented
not
directly
to
his
board,
but
it
can
be
inferred
from
the
record
that
the
board
had
notice,
the
fact
that
he
was
attending
union
theological
seminary.
he
did
not
request
the
deferment.
some
cases
have
suggested
that
it's
not
necessary.
we
point
out
the
difference
between
the
language
of
6-g,
the
language
providing
for
student-deferments
which
requires
an
affirmative
request
by
the
registrant.
the
language
of
6-g
is
--
shall
be
deferred.
the
second
circuit
--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
absolutely,
not
your
honor.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
well,
the
trial
court
found
that
he
was
in
full
time
attendance
and
that
he
was
pursuing
a
degree
leading
to
study
for
the
priesthood.
what
the
trial
court
did
not
find
is
that
he
was
there
under
the
direction
of
a
recognized
church
since
the
union
theological
seminary
is
not
itself
under
the
direction
of
a
church.
it's
non-sectarian.
there
was
no
evidence
according
to
the
trial
judge
in
the
record
that
he
was
there
under
the
direction
of
a
recognized
church.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
that
is
a
statutory
requirement.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
that's
right.
now,
we
do
suggest
in
our
brief
that
selective
service
procedures
under
such
circumstances
authorize
a
board
to
look
into
the
basis
for
a
deferment
and
in
fact,
mandate
that
they
do
so
when
they
had
certain
preliminary
information.
the
major
point
to
which
i
would
like
to
address
myself
on
exhaustion
question
is
that,
it
is
a
doctrine
of
judicial
convenience
to
be
applied
flexibly
that
has
its
origin
in
affirmative
litigation
where
a
plaintiff
comes
in
seeking
relief
and
there
are
still
administrative
remedies
to
be
exhausted.
its
--
professor
davis
tells
us
it
is
a
doctrine
concerned
with
the
timing
of
judicial
review
and
that
it
is
not
imposed
with
absolutely
and
completely
deny
relief
as
it
would
here.
and
even
when
used
in
affirmative
litigation,
there
are
recognized
exceptions,
so
that
it
will
not
be
applied
too
harshly.
we
point
in
our
brief
to
justice
frankfurter's
opinion
in
the
public
utilities
commission
versus
united
fuel
case,
where
it
would
in
effect
impose
irreparable
injury
on
a
litigant.
that
is
a
recognized
exception
to
the
exhaustion
role
and
that
is
an
exception
which
we
urge
would
apply
here.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
no,
we
do
not
and
we
make
a
distinction
in
our
brief
--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
because
i
believe
the
act
requires
minimally
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
local
board.
we
urge
the
distinction
as
does
davis
in
his
treaty
between
primary
jurisdiction
and
exhaustion.
you're
entitled
to
review
of
your
classification.
if
your
classification
is
supported
--
is
not
supported
by
any
fact
then
a
court
could
not
properly
go
into
anything
that
was
not
before
the
local
board.
mcgee
here
by
concession
of
the
second
circuit
did
present
to
the
local
board
what
was
necessary
to
support
his
classification.
we
don't
quarrel
with
the
fact
that
he
has
the
burden
of
proving
his
classification.
we
only
say
here
that
he
met
that
burden.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
that's
correct
and
we
suggest
here
that
he
did
prove
that
to
them.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
that's
right
that
he
is
entitled
in
court
to
judicial
review
of
his
classification.
his
classification
was
determined
by
the
local
board
and
was
determined
here
without
a
basis
in
fact.
the
effect
of
the
application
of
the
exhaustion
rule
in
this
case
and
in
criminal
cases
generally
is
to
work
a
very
substantial
denial
of
a
right
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
the
difference
between
the
application
of
that
rule
in
an
affirmative
and
defense
of
case
was
elaborated
on
by
chief
judge
mcgruder
in
two
cases
cited
in
our
brief,
the
smith
and
mccrellis
case
and
there,
the
judge
said
that,
we
do
not
have
to
apply
the
exhaustion
rule
in
the
defensive
context.
it
is
a
judge
made
rule
and
we
only
have
to
when
it
is
mandated
by
congress
and
the
court
there
dealt
with
the
two
major
precedents
in
this
court
upon
which
exhaustion
has
been
premised,
namely
yerkes
and
myers
versus
bethlehem
shipbuilding.
and
the
court
there
said,
“those
were
specifically
cases
in
which
congress
had
mandated
the
exhaustion
prior
to
judicial
review.”
here
as
we
said
before,
there
was
congressional
mandate
to
that
effect
and
in
fact,
the
congressional
mandate
is
to
the
contrary
that
it
authorizes
judicial
review.
that
brings
us
to
mckart.
mckart,
we
submit,
reflects
that
general
suspicion
of
the
exhaustion
remedy.
it
draws
the
distinctions
between
affirmative
and
defensive
context.
it
points
out
that
in
a
defensive
context,
it
is
an
exceedingly
harsh
doctrine
and
it
should
be
imposed
there
only
where
it
clearly
out
ways
the
interests
of
the
registrant
in
having
a
right
to
assert
a
defense
to
a
criminal
prosecution.
the
major
interest
to
be
served
here
is
whether
or
not
other
registrants
are
going
to
be
led
by
the
relaxation
of
the
exhaustion
rule
in
this
case
to
forgo
their
administrative
remedies
and
come
into
court
in
defense
of
a
criminal
prosecution.
the
mckart,
court
suggested
that
maybe
there's
a
difference
between
the
legal
issue
presented
there
in
the
co
claim.
the
co
claim
we
submit
is
a
legal
issue.
you
take
as
the
court
does
in
any
basis
in
fact
case
before
it,
an
undisputed
set
of
facts
and
apply
them
to
a
legal
standard.
it
is
the
same
issue
which
confronts
this
court
whether
or
not
there
is
exhaustion,
there
is
no
different
burden.
the
question
then
is
are
other
registrants
going
to
do
what
mcgee
did.
recognizing
as
we
must
that
what
mcgee
did,
he
did
for
out
of
reasons
of
moral
scruples,
but
will
other
registrants
do
it
for
tactical
reasons
and
the
government's
response
to
this
is
crucial
and
i
think
deserves
special
attention.
the
government
says,
“if
we
let
mcgee
decline
to
appear
before
his
local
board
as
he
did
here,
decline
to
appeal
his
administrative
remedies,
then
the
well
counseled
registrant
is
going
to
submit
a
bare
form
150,
will
provide
on
its
face
no
basis
in
fact
for
denial.
it
will
not
have
a
great
deal
of
documentation.
it
will
simply
be
the
form
150.”
mr.
alan
h.
levine
it
is
your
honor,
right.
at
that
point,
he
will
be
classified,
presumably,
i-a
by
his
board,
told
that
he
has
a
right
to
a
personal
appearance
not
that
he
must
personally
appear,
mcgee
was
not
told,
he
must
personally
appear,
only
that
he
had
right
to
appear,
refuse
to
appear,
told
that
he
has
a
right
to
appeal
and
refuse
to
appeal,
he
will
then
refuse
induction
and
have
perfect
defense
before
the
court.
there
will
be
no
basis
in
fact
upon
which
a
court
could
uphold
the
i-a
classification.
we
suggest
to
couple
of
things;
one,
mcgee
didn't
just
make
out
of
prima
facie
case
before
his
local
board
--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
well,
the
government's
thesis
is
that
he
would
simply
submit
a
form
150
perhaps
with
supporting
letters
if
they
could
be
obtained.
of
course,
there
one
has
to
assume
perhaps
certain
impropriety
in
obtaining
those
letters
if
it
was
not
bona
fide
claim,
but
the
government's
thesis
in
any
case
is
as
bare
a
submission
as
possible
and
--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
i
submit
there
would
be
and
we
submit
in
our
brief
that
there
would
be
substantial
basis,
in
fact,
for
denying
his
claim
and
if
the
form
150
was
considered
by
the
board
to
be
inadequate,
it
left
them
in
doubt,
we
have
a
pretty
well
stated
claim
here
but
we
want
to
see
him
to
test
his
sincerity.
the
remedy
is
simple,
we
are
attach
in
our
reply
brief,
new
york
city
form
44
which
says,
call
in
the
registrant
and
there
is
a
space
there
for
the
local
board
to
check
off,
send
it
to
a
registrant,
and
say,
you
are
ordered
to
appear
before
the
local
board
to
discuss
your
claim.
that
is
the
simple
remedy
available
to
the
board
in
cases
where
they
find
themselves
in
doubt.
if
they
are
not
in
doubt,
their
obligation
is
to
classify
i-o.
they
can't
simply
have
vague
doubt.
dickinson,
witmer
teach
us
that
there
must
be
affirmative
evidence.
now,
it
might
be
affirmative
evidence
that
he
fails
to
present
a
clear
and
accurate
picture
and
if
the
board
has
doubts
as
i
suggest,
he
can
be
called
in.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
no,
we
suggest
that
under
current
selective
service
procedures,
the
board
has
put
it
self
or
the
system
has
put
itself
in
the
position
of
classifying
without
a
personal
appearance.
the
sequence
is
that
you
submit
your
claim,
you
are
classified,
then
you
have
your
right
to
personal
appearance.
now,
if
that's
the
way
the
selective
system
--
selective
services
system
wants
to
classify,
they
can
and
when
you
submit
your
form
150,
if
it's
a
good
claim,
they're
obliged
to
give
you
your
classification.
if
it
is
inadequate
claim,
then
either
you
have
not
met
your
burden
of
proving
your
entitlement
to
the
claim
and
the
board
then
is
obliged
to
state
its
reasons
why
you
have
not
met
your
claim
or
if
the
board
then
is
left
in
doubt,
then
since
the
registrants
has
made
out
his
prima
facie
case,
it's
up
to
the
board
then
to
find
some
affirmative
evidence
and
that
if
it
needs
a
personal
appearance
then
it
can
order
that
personal
appearance.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
that's
the
government's
point.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
that
is
the
major
response
to
which
the
government
had
advance
us
to
our
suggestion
that
registrants
will
not
look
at
this
court's
decision
in
mcgee,
assuming
it's
favorable
to
mcgee
and
say,
“hey,
there's
a
good
out
force,
we'll
simply
fail
to
appear,
fail
to
exhaust
and
defend
in
a
criminal
prosecution.”
we
submit
that
the
best
way
still
to
get
a
classification
is
to
go
through
the
selective
service
system
and
that
the
only
people
who
don't
and
if
one
looks
through
the
exhaustion
cases
the
only
ones
who
don't
are
the
very
rare
people
like
mcgee
and
there
seems
to
have
been
in
the
reported
cases
only
one
other,
conscientiously
disassociated
themselves
from
the
system
or
those
who
are
ignorant.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
thank
you.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
i
will
try
to
be
brief
in
saving
a
minute
or
two
for
rebuttal
if
i
may.
mr.
justice
white
asked
prior
to
the
luncheon
break.
what
was
the
statutory
requirement
for
the
claim
initially
to
be
presented
to
the
local
board?
i've
quote
from
section
10
(b)
(3)
of
the
act,
which
says
that
a
local
board
“shall
hear
and
determine
all
questions
or
claims
with
respect
to
inclusion
for
or
exemption
or
deferment
from
training
and
service
under
this
title.”
i
think
pursuant
to
that
requirement,
the
registrant
has
the
burden
of
going
forward
with
his
claim
to
the
local
board.
the
major
deterrent
to
any
other
registrant
--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
the
statute
only
said
--
the
statute
says
that
the
court
shall
only
review
a
basis
in
fact
and
presumably
that
is
the
limitation
on
this
court's
review
or
on
any
court's
review.
that
they
cannot
consider
the
whole
claim
on
it
merits,
but
only
whether
or
not
there
was
a
basis
in
fact
for
denial.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
that's
right,
your
honor.
the
major
deterrent
though,
for
another
registrant
to
do
what
mcgee
did
here
is
a
simple
fact
that
if
he
wants
his
classification,
the
best
place
to
do
it
is
before
the
selective
service
system.
he
only
has
to
convince
the
selective
service
system
on
the
merits
that
he
is
entitled
to
the
classification,
whereas
a
court
in
review
would
only
be
determining
whether
or
not
there
was
a
basis
in
fact
for
denial
of
that
claim.
we
cite
this
--
a
long
line
of
cases
in
this
court,
green
versus
mccoroy,
kent
versus
dallas
would
suggest
that
substantial
rights,
here
the
right
to
defend
yourself
in
a
criminal
prosecution
should
not
be
abrogated
without
explicit
congressional
authorization.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
i
did
not
mean
to
suggest
that
there
would
be
a
different
standard
of
judicial
review
applicable
to
mcgee's
claim
and
there
would
be
to
a
claim
where
in
fact
the
classification
was
appealed.
i
think
the
standard
from
mcgee's
claim
the
one
used
by
the
second
circuit
was
a
basis,
in
fact
,the
claim
has
well
has
it
would
be
if
he
had
appealed.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
you
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
second
circuit.
the
petitioner
seeks
to
review
of
convictions
on
four
counts
under
the
military
selective
service
act
of
1967.
the
chief
question
presented
by
this
petition
is
the
question
left
open
in
mckart
versus
united
states.
it
presents
the
pure
question
of
whether
where
a
registrant
presents
a
claim
for
conscious
objection
and
that
claim
is
denied
without
a
basis
in
fact
as
the
second
circuit
concedes
here
it
was
so
denied,
and
where
therefore,
the
classification
--
i-a
classification
and
the
induction
order
were
illegal,
is
he
barred
from
challenging
that
classification
and
induction
order
in
judicial
review.
in
answering
that
question,
no,
we
will
assert
two
basic
propositions.
one
that
the
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
doctrine
is
inappropriately
applied,
whereas
mckart
suggested,
its
effect
is
not
merely
to
delay
judicial
review,
but
is
to
deny
it
completely
and
we
will
defend,
secondly,
the
proposition
that
if
the
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
is
to
be
applied
so
harshly.
it
must
be
applied
with
congressional
mandate
in
that
the
military
selective
service
act
of
1967
to
the
contrary,
does
not
limit
judicial
review
in
defense
to
a
criminal
prosecution,
but
in
fact
guarantees
judicial
review
in
defense
to
a
criminal
prosecution.
petitioner,
at
the
time
of
induction
was
a
full
time
student
at
union
theological
seminary.
he
had
registered
for
the
draft
in
august
of
1961
in
new
york
city.
he
had
advised
his
local
board
at
that
time
that
he
was
preparing
for
the
ministry.
in
august
of
1964,
he
enrolled
in
the
university
of
rochester
the
next
month
was
a
given
a
ii-s
deferment
for
all
practical
purposes
kept
that
deferment
until
september
of
1967.
in
february
1966
while
still
at
the
university
of
rochester
and
still
possessing
at
ii-s
classification,
he
applied
for
conscientious
objector
status.
pursuant
to
regulations,
the
local
board
deferred
consideration
of
that
application
until
he
was
no
longer
entitled
to
a
lower
classification.
in
march
of
1966,
he
got
a
letter
from
the
local
board
to
that
effect
that
they
would
defer
consideration
of
co
application.
in
april
of
1967,
still
at
rochester,
still
possessing
a
ii-s,
the
petitioner
wrote
the
president
of
the
united
states.
he
enclosed
in
that
letter
remnants
of
a
torn
and
burnt
draft
card.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
it
was
not
nor
was
he
indicted
in
indictments
under
review
here.
subsequent
to
the
trial
in
this
case,
he
was
indicted
on
two
counts
of
destroying
a
draft
card.
those
cases
have
not
come
to
trial,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
it
is
not
your
honor.
he
wrote
to
president
in
april
1967.
he
advised
the
president
that
he
would
probably
be
entitled
to
a
theological
deferment.
nevertheless,
he
said,
“i
must
sever
every
link
with
violence
and
war.”
he
expressed,
“the
fundamental
belief
that
man
must
build
and
not
destroy,
love
and
not
hate.”
as
a
result,
he
said
that
he
could
no
longer
cooperate
with
the
selective
service
system.
in
june
of
1967,
upon
his
graduation
from
rochester,
he
was
sent
a
current
information
questionnaire,
sss
form
127.
he
returned
that
questionnaire
unopened
and
said
that
he
would
return
all
future
correspondence
unopened.
in
september
of
1967,
he
was
classified
i-a
despite
his
pending
co
application.
he
returned
that
i-a
classification
card.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
that's
right
in
march
of
1966.
this
is
--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
no.
no,
this
is
september
1967
that
i'm
talking
about.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
right.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
in
march
of
1966.
the
board
chairman
testified
at
trial
somewhat
ambiguously
and
it
is
a
result
of
his
testimony
as
to
what
the
board
did
in
march
1966
and
september
1967
that
led
judge
feinberg
to
conclude
that
in
fact
the
board
had
never
considered
the
application
on
its
merits.
that
in
september
1967,
according
to
the
board
chairman's
testimony,
they
had
just
reaffirmed
their
earlier
decision.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
presumably
because
they
were
aware
from
his
earlier
request
for
ii-s
that
he
was
going
to
graduate
in
june
of
1967.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
it
was
a
current
information
form
and
--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
well,
the
board
had
before
his
claim
as
to
conscientious
objection.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
it
was
a
year
and
a
couple
of
months
before
that
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
well,
if
he
had
told
the
board
at
that
time
that
he
was
no
longer
entitled
to
ii-s,
presumably
in
the
course
of
normal
procedures,
the
board
would
have
considered
his
co
application
at
that
time.
this
current
information
questionnaire
does
not
contain
reference
to
conscientious
objection.
he
would
have
advised
them
i've
graduated,
i'm
entitled
--
i'm
no
longer
entitled
to
ii-s
and
therefore,
the
board
would
have
seen
in
his
file
that
he
had
a
pending
co
application.
presumably,
according
to
the
board
chairman's
somewhat
ambiguous
testimony
that
is
what
they
did
in
september
of
1967.
they
considered
his
entire
file
and
to
co
application.
as
i
said
judge
feinberg
thinks
that
they
did
not
consider
his
application
on
the
merits
at
all.
the
trial
judge,
however,
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
at
the
close
of
trial
that
the
application
had
been
considered.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
pardon?
and
rejected,
that's
correct.
petitioner
did
not
appeal
that
classification.
later
that
month,
he
enrolled
in
union
theological
seminary.
in
october
of
1967,
he
was
ordered
to
report
--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
he
did
send
it
back
unopened,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
presumably,
he
did
not.
he
sent
back
the
i-a
unopened,
later
that
month
enrolled
in
union
theological
seminary.
in
october
of
1967,
he
was
sent
an
order
to
report
for
physical
examination,
he
returned
that
order
unopened.
he
was
ordered
to
report
for
induction
in
january
of
1968,
he
filled
out
a
number
of
forms
giving
a
variety
of
different
kinds
of
information
at
that
time.
he
took
a
complete
physical
examination
--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
pardon?
mr.
alan
h.
levine
he
did
open
that
envelop.
he
reported
as
ordered
to
report.
he
gave
the
required
information.
he
took
the
required
physical
examination,
passed
the
physical
examination
and
refuse
to
submit
to
induction.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
it's
given
by
the
military
for
selective
service.
it's
given
at
the
arm
forces
entrance
examination.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
no,
this
was
at
the
time
of
induction.
his
file
was
then
forwarded
to
the
united
states'
attorney
significantly
with
a
recommendation
of
selective
service
that
he
be
indicted
only
on
two
counts,
refusal
of
induction
and
failure
to
possess
his
notice
of
classification.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
why
he
opened
the
--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
not
from
the
record,
your
honor.
i
did
not
represent
petitioner
at
that
time.
perhaps
he
spoke
to
legal
counsel
at
that
time.
i
do
not
know
and
the
record
does
not
indicate.
despite
the
recommendation
of
selective
service
that
he
be
prosecuted
on
two
counts,
in
february
of
1968,
the
government
sought
and
obtained
a
four-count
indictment.
the
first
count
was
the
refusal
of
induction;
the
second,
was
for
refusal
to
take
the
physical
examination;
the
third,
was
the
failure
to
possess
the
notice
of
classification
and
the
fourth,
for
failure
to
submit
the
information
requested
on
the
classification
from.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
they
are
generally
envelops,
i
believe
your
honor.
petitioner
was
found
guilty
in
january
of
1969
on
all
four
counts
and
sentenced
to
two-year
concurrent
sentences
on
each
count.
in
march
of
1970,
the
second
circuit
upheld
the
convictions,
judge
feinberg
dissenting.
the
three
judges
in
the
second
circuit
conceded
that
there
was
no
basis
in
fact
for
the
board
to
deny
petitioner's
conscientious
objector
claim.
nevertheless,
they
said
that
because
he
failed
to
exhaust
his
appeal
remedies
within
selective
service,
they
would
decline
to
review
the
classification.
we
point
out
first
that
the
1967
military
selective
service
act
of
1967
provides
for
review
of
classification
“as
a
defense
to
a
criminal
prosecution.”
it
does
not
qualify
that
right.
it
does
not
condition
it
on
exhausting
administrative
remedies.
it
says
rather
that
it
can
be
raised
and
review
can
be
had
after
a
registrant
has
responded
to
an
order
to
report
for
induction.
it's
important
to
note
your
honors
that
the
congress
had
before
it
the
entire
question
of
judicial
review.
it
is
not
an
inadvertence
that
this
aspect
of
judicial
review
is
stated
as
it
is.
they
had
it
before
it.
they
considered
the
question
of
judicial
review
and
limited
only
pre-induction
review.
the
question
before
this
court
in
oestereich
as
a
senate
arm
services
committee
said,
“if
the
registrant
does
not
submit
to
induction,
he
may
raise
as
a
defense
to
a
criminal
prosecution
the
issue
of
the
legality
of
the
classification.”
the
effect
of
that
act
is
to
guarantee
judicial
review
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
the
second
circuit
conceded
that
petitioner
was
unlawfully
classified.
implicitly,
it
conceded
that
he
was
sent
to
jail
for
two
years
or
it
has
been
ordered
to
jail
two
years
for
violating
an
illegal
order.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
that
is
correct,
they
deal
with
that
claim
and
i
will
touch
on
it
briefly,
but
the
major
issue
and
the
issue
upon
which
judge
feinberg
relied
in
dissent
was
the
conscientious
objector
issue.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
well,
let
me
say
briefly,
your
honor,
that
the
congressional
mandate
for
ministerial
deferments
under
6-g
is
i
say
--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
that's
right,
is
mandatory.
he
shall
be
deferred
assuming
he
meets
certain
qualification.
that's
full
time
attendance
under
the
direction
of
a
recognized
church.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
that
is
correct.
now,
mcgee
presented
not
directly
to
his
board,
but
it
can
be
inferred
from
the
record
that
the
board
had
notice,
the
fact
that
he
was
attending
union
theological
seminary.
he
did
not
request
the
deferment.
some
cases
have
suggested
that
it's
not
necessary.
we
point
out
the
difference
between
the
language
of
6-g,
the
language
providing
for
student-deferments
which
requires
an
affirmative
request
by
the
registrant.
the
language
of
6-g
is
--
shall
be
deferred.
the
second
circuit
--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
absolutely,
not
your
honor.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
well,
the
trial
court
found
that
he
was
in
full
time
attendance
and
that
he
was
pursuing
a
degree
leading
to
study
for
the
priesthood.
what
the
trial
court
did
not
find
is
that
he
was
there
under
the
direction
of
a
recognized
church
since
the
union
theological
seminary
is
not
itself
under
the
direction
of
a
church.
it's
non-sectarian.
there
was
no
evidence
according
to
the
trial
judge
in
the
record
that
he
was
there
under
the
direction
of
a
recognized
church.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
that
is
a
statutory
requirement.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
that's
right.
now,
we
do
suggest
in
our
brief
that
selective
service
procedures
under
such
circumstances
authorize
a
board
to
look
into
the
basis
for
a
deferment
and
in
fact,
mandate
that
they
do
so
when
they
had
certain
preliminary
information.
the
major
point
to
which
i
would
like
to
address
myself
on
exhaustion
question
is
that,
it
is
a
doctrine
of
judicial
convenience
to
be
applied
flexibly
that
has
its
origin
in
affirmative
litigation
where
a
plaintiff
comes
in
seeking
relief
and
there
are
still
administrative
remedies
to
be
exhausted.
its
--
professor
davis
tells
us
it
is
a
doctrine
concerned
with
the
timing
of
judicial
review
and
that
it
is
not
imposed
with
absolutely
and
completely
deny
relief
as
it
would
here.
and
even
when
used
in
affirmative
litigation,
there
are
recognized
exceptions,
so
that
it
will
not
be
applied
too
harshly.
we
point
in
our
brief
to
justice
frankfurter's
opinion
in
the
public
utilities
commission
versus
united
fuel
case,
where
it
would
in
effect
impose
irreparable
injury
on
a
litigant.
that
is
a
recognized
exception
to
the
exhaustion
role
and
that
is
an
exception
which
we
urge
would
apply
here.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
no,
we
do
not
and
we
make
a
distinction
in
our
brief
--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
because
i
believe
the
act
requires
minimally
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
local
board.
we
urge
the
distinction
as
does
davis
in
his
treaty
between
primary
jurisdiction
and
exhaustion.
you're
entitled
to
review
of
your
classification.
if
your
classification
is
supported
--
is
not
supported
by
any
fact
then
a
court
could
not
properly
go
into
anything
that
was
not
before
the
local
board.
mcgee
here
by
concession
of
the
second
circuit
did
present
to
the
local
board
what
was
necessary
to
support
his
classification.
we
don't
quarrel
with
the
fact
that
he
has
the
burden
of
proving
his
classification.
we
only
say
here
that
he
met
that
burden.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
that's
correct
and
we
suggest
here
that
he
did
prove
that
to
them.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
that's
right
that
he
is
entitled
in
court
to
judicial
review
of
his
classification.
his
classification
was
determined
by
the
local
board
and
was
determined
here
without
a
basis
in
fact.
the
effect
of
the
application
of
the
exhaustion
rule
in
this
case
and
in
criminal
cases
generally
is
to
work
a
very
substantial
denial
of
a
right
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
the
difference
between
the
application
of
that
rule
in
an
affirmative
and
defense
of
case
was
elaborated
on
by
chief
judge
mcgruder
in
two
cases
cited
in
our
brief,
the
smith
and
mccrellis
case
and
there,
the
judge
said
that,
we
do
not
have
to
apply
the
exhaustion
rule
in
the
defensive
context.
it
is
a
judge
made
rule
and
we
only
have
to
when
it
is
mandated
by
congress
and
the
court
there
dealt
with
the
two
major
precedents
in
this
court
upon
which
exhaustion
has
been
premised,
namely
yerkes
and
myers
versus
bethlehem
shipbuilding.
and
the
court
there
said,
“those
were
specifically
cases
in
which
congress
had
mandated
the
exhaustion
prior
to
judicial
review.”
here
as
we
said
before,
there
was
congressional
mandate
to
that
effect
and
in
fact,
the
congressional
mandate
is
to
the
contrary
that
it
authorizes
judicial
review.
that
brings
us
to
mckart.
mckart,
we
submit,
reflects
that
general
suspicion
of
the
exhaustion
remedy.
it
draws
the
distinctions
between
affirmative
and
defensive
context.
it
points
out
that
in
a
defensive
context,
it
is
an
exceedingly
harsh
doctrine
and
it
should
be
imposed
there
only
where
it
clearly
out
ways
the
interests
of
the
registrant
in
having
a
right
to
assert
a
defense
to
a
criminal
prosecution.
the
major
interest
to
be
served
here
is
whether
or
not
other
registrants
are
going
to
be
led
by
the
relaxation
of
the
exhaustion
rule
in
this
case
to
forgo
their
administrative
remedies
and
come
into
court
in
defense
of
a
criminal
prosecution.
the
mckart,
court
suggested
that
maybe
there's
a
difference
between
the
legal
issue
presented
there
in
the
co
claim.
the
co
claim
we
submit
is
a
legal
issue.
you
take
as
the
court
does
in
any
basis
in
fact
case
before
it,
an
undisputed
set
of
facts
and
apply
them
to
a
legal
standard.
it
is
the
same
issue
which
confronts
this
court
whether
or
not
there
is
exhaustion,
there
is
no
different
burden.
the
question
then
is
are
other
registrants
going
to
do
what
mcgee
did.
recognizing
as
we
must
that
what
mcgee
did,
he
did
for
out
of
reasons
of
moral
scruples,
but
will
other
registrants
do
it
for
tactical
reasons
and
the
government's
response
to
this
is
crucial
and
i
think
deserves
special
attention.
the
government
says,
“if
we
let
mcgee
decline
to
appear
before
his
local
board
as
he
did
here,
decline
to
appeal
his
administrative
remedies,
then
the
well
counseled
registrant
is
going
to
submit
a
bare
form
150,
will
provide
on
its
face
no
basis
in
fact
for
denial.
it
will
not
have
a
great
deal
of
documentation.
it
will
simply
be
the
form
150.”
mr.
alan
h.
levine
it
is
your
honor,
right.
at
that
point,
he
will
be
classified,
presumably,
i-a
by
his
board,
told
that
he
has
a
right
to
a
personal
appearance
not
that
he
must
personally
appear,
mcgee
was
not
told,
he
must
personally
appear,
only
that
he
had
right
to
appear,
refuse
to
appear,
told
that
he
has
a
right
to
appeal
and
refuse
to
appeal,
he
will
then
refuse
induction
and
have
perfect
defense
before
the
court.
there
will
be
no
basis
in
fact
upon
which
a
court
could
uphold
the
i-a
classification.
we
suggest
to
couple
of
things;
one,
mcgee
didn't
just
make
out
of
prima
facie
case
before
his
local
board
--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
well,
the
government's
thesis
is
that
he
would
simply
submit
a
form
150
perhaps
with
supporting
letters
if
they
could
be
obtained.
of
course,
there
one
has
to
assume
perhaps
certain
impropriety
in
obtaining
those
letters
if
it
was
not
bona
fide
claim,
but
the
government's
thesis
in
any
case
is
as
bare
a
submission
as
possible
and
--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
i
submit
there
would
be
and
we
submit
in
our
brief
that
there
would
be
substantial
basis,
in
fact,
for
denying
his
claim
and
if
the
form
150
was
considered
by
the
board
to
be
inadequate,
it
left
them
in
doubt,
we
have
a
pretty
well
stated
claim
here
but
we
want
to
see
him
to
test
his
sincerity.
the
remedy
is
simple,
we
are
attach
in
our
reply
brief,
new
york
city
form
44
which
says,
call
in
the
registrant
and
there
is
a
space
there
for
the
local
board
to
check
off,
send
it
to
a
registrant,
and
say,
you
are
ordered
to
appear
before
the
local
board
to
discuss
your
claim.
that
is
the
simple
remedy
available
to
the
board
in
cases
where
they
find
themselves
in
doubt.
if
they
are
not
in
doubt,
their
obligation
is
to
classify
i-o.
they
can't
simply
have
vague
doubt.
dickinson,
witmer
teach
us
that
there
must
be
affirmative
evidence.
now,
it
might
be
affirmative
evidence
that
he
fails
to
present
a
clear
and
accurate
picture
and
if
the
board
has
doubts
as
i
suggest,
he
can
be
called
in.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
no,
we
suggest
that
under
current
selective
service
procedures,
the
board
has
put
it
self
or
the
system
has
put
itself
in
the
position
of
classifying
without
a
personal
appearance.
the
sequence
is
that
you
submit
your
claim,
you
are
classified,
then
you
have
your
right
to
personal
appearance.
now,
if
that's
the
way
the
selective
system
--
selective
services
system
wants
to
classify,
they
can
and
when
you
submit
your
form
150,
if
it's
a
good
claim,
they're
obliged
to
give
you
your
classification.
if
it
is
inadequate
claim,
then
either
you
have
not
met
your
burden
of
proving
your
entitlement
to
the
claim
and
the
board
then
is
obliged
to
state
its
reasons
why
you
have
not
met
your
claim
or
if
the
board
then
is
left
in
doubt,
then
since
the
registrants
has
made
out
his
prima
facie
case,
it's
up
to
the
board
then
to
find
some
affirmative
evidence
and
that
if
it
needs
a
personal
appearance
then
it
can
order
that
personal
appearance.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
that's
the
government's
point.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
that
is
the
major
response
to
which
the
government
had
advance
us
to
our
suggestion
that
registrants
will
not
look
at
this
court's
decision
in
mcgee,
assuming
it's
favorable
to
mcgee
and
say,
“hey,
there's
a
good
out
force,
we'll
simply
fail
to
appear,
fail
to
exhaust
and
defend
in
a
criminal
prosecution.”
we
submit
that
the
best
way
still
to
get
a
classification
is
to
go
through
the
selective
service
system
and
that
the
only
people
who
don't
and
if
one
looks
through
the
exhaustion
cases
the
only
ones
who
don't
are
the
very
rare
people
like
mcgee
and
there
seems
to
have
been
in
the
reported
cases
only
one
other,
conscientiously
disassociated
themselves
from
the
system
or
those
who
are
ignorant.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
thank
you.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
i
will
try
to
be
brief
in
saving
a
minute
or
two
for
rebuttal
if
i
may.
mr.
justice
white
asked
prior
to
the
luncheon
break.
what
was
the
statutory
requirement
for
the
claim
initially
to
be
presented
to
the
local
board?
i've
quote
from
section
10
(b)
(3)
of
the
act,
which
says
that
a
local
board
“shall
hear
and
determine
all
questions
or
claims
with
respect
to
inclusion
for
or
exemption
or
deferment
from
training
and
service
under
this
title.”
i
think
pursuant
to
that
requirement,
the
registrant
has
the
burden
of
going
forward
with
his
claim
to
the
local
board.
the
major
deterrent
to
any
other
registrant
--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
the
statute
only
said
--
the
statute
says
that
the
court
shall
only
review
a
basis
in
fact
and
presumably
that
is
the
limitation
on
this
court's
review
or
on
any
court's
review.
that
they
cannot
consider
the
whole
claim
on
it
merits,
but
only
whether
or
not
there
was
a
basis
in
fact
for
denial.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
that's
right,
your
honor.
the
major
deterrent
though,
for
another
registrant
to
do
what
mcgee
did
here
is
a
simple
fact
that
if
he
wants
his
classification,
the
best
place
to
do
it
is
before
the
selective
service
system.
he
only
has
to
convince
the
selective
service
system
on
the
merits
that
he
is
entitled
to
the
classification,
whereas
a
court
in
review
would
only
be
determining
whether
or
not
there
was
a
basis
in
fact
for
denial
of
that
claim.
we
cite
this
--
a
long
line
of
cases
in
this
court,
green
versus
mccoroy,
kent
versus
dallas
would
suggest
that
substantial
rights,
here
the
right
to
defend
yourself
in
a
criminal
prosecution
should
not
be
abrogated
without
explicit
congressional
authorization.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
i
did
not
mean
to
suggest
that
there
would
be
a
different
standard
of
judicial
review
applicable
to
mcgee's
claim
and
there
would
be
to
a
claim
where
in
fact
the
classification
was
appealed.
i
think
the
standard
from
mcgee's
claim
the
one
used
by
the
second
circuit
was
a
basis,
in
fact
,the
claim
has
well
has
it
would
be
if
he
had
appealed.
thank
you,
your
honors.
