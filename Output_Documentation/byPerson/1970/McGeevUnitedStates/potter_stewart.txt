justice
potter
stewart
now,
that
co
application
that
you
just
characterized
as
pending
is
one
that
been
filed
when
he
was
student
at
university
of
rochester?
justice
potter
stewart
three
years
or
three-and-a-half
years
earlier?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
year-and-a-half?
justice
potter
stewart
okay.
at
that
time,
the
board
had
indicated
that
since
he
was
--
had
a
ii-s
student
deferment,
there
was
no
need
for
them
to
consider
the
co
application?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
a
current
information
form.
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
did
--
he
received
his
i-a
classification
i.e.
he
did
not
send
it
back
unopened?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
he
didn't
even
know
that
he
have
been
classified
i-a,
is
that
--
before
that?
justice
potter
stewart
so
he
did
open
that
envelop?
justice
potter
stewart
so
he
did
open
that
envelop
--
justice
potter
stewart
now,
that
was
a
physical
examination
given
at
the
--
by
selective
service
or
by
the
military?
justice
potter
stewart
but
at
the
time
of
induction
or
quite
awhile
before?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
indication
why
he
changed
his
mind
regarding
how
he
would
deal
with
mail
address
to
him
by
his
draft
board?
justice
potter
stewart
he
sent
several
of
them
back
including
his
i-a
classification,
you
said
back
unopened
and
then
when
there
arrived
other
communication,
one
asking
him
--
one
directing
him
to
report
for
a
physical
examination
he
not
only
opened
the
communication,
but
complied
with
it
in
part.
is
there
any
indication
of
why?
justice
potter
stewart
the
court
of
appeals'
theory
that
concession
as
you
call
it
that
your
plan
have
been
erroneously
classified
was
based
on
his
conscientious
objector
claim
or
other
than
on
his
attendance
at
a
theological
school
as
i
understand,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
what
then
--
well,
i
suppose
--
there's
some
question
i
suppose
about
whether
his
mere
attendance
in
the
union
theological
seminary
was
sufficient.
it's
not
sufficient
under
the
law,
not
mere
attendance
at
the
theological
seminary,
isn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
the
school
deferments?
justice
potter
stewart
and
studying
to
become
a
priest.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
not
for
mere
attendance
though.
i
thought
you
and
i
agreed.
we
can
assume
a
man
who
would
just
likes
to
go
around
philosophically
and
has
plenty
of
time
and
money
so
he
goes
to
various
theological
schools
in
order
to
increase
his
knowledge
about
comparative
religion,
has
no
intent
ever
become
a
minister
of
the
gospel
or
a
pastoral
leader,
but
simply
wants
to
increase
his
intellectual,
philosophical
and
religious
knowledge.
that
man
would
be
subject
to
statutory
deferment,
would
he?
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
far
as
the
record
shows
that
was
the
purpose
of
this
fellow
and
your
client
excuse
me
in
attending
--
i
mean
so
far
as
the
record
shows,
we
don't
know
that
this
was
his
purpose.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
the
statutory
requirement?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
a
statutory
exemption
that's
necessary.
justice
potter
stewart
the
form
150
is
the
conscientious
objectors
form?
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
just
thinking
in
your
hypothetical
case
there
will
be
plenty
of
bases
of
in
fact
to
support
a
i-a
classification,
if
the
man
had
not
submitted
anything
to
support
a
conscientious
objector
--
justice
potter
stewart
then
that
wouldn't,
if
the
submission
was
at
that
minimal
materials
submitted
with
it,
there
would
be
plenty
of
basis
in
fact
for
i-a
classification,
wouldn't
he,
if
there
wasn't
enough
to
support
a
conscientious
objector
classification?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
the
points
you
just
made,
if
the
selective
service
system
in
its
administrative
review
should
deny
his
claim
for
conscientious
objector
status
then
that
finding,
that
denial
would
have
to
be
accepted
by
the
court,
if
there
were
a
basis
in
fact
for
that
denial,
whereas
if
somebody
proceeded
along
the
lines
that
your
client
did
and
somebody
well
counseled
to
use
your
phrase,
then,
he
would
get
up
in
brand
new
judicial
de
novo
determination
if
you're
right
as
to
the
validity
of
his
conscientious
objector
claim
which
might
be
more
beneficial
than
the
very,
very
limited
review
that
the
court
would
be
confined
to
if
the
claim
had
been
denied,
the
selective
service
administrative
procedure?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
mean
by
violating
the
law,
you
mean
refuse
to
submit
for
induction?
justice
potter
stewart
because
his
claim
is,
he
is
not
violating
the
law
because
he
is
entitled
to
conscientious
objector?
justice
potter
stewart
did
he
send
to
the
local
board
a
copy
of
this
letter
to
the
president?
