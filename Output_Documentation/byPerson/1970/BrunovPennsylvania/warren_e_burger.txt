mr.
quinlan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
quinlan,
how
is
this
background
relevant
to
the
question
whether
he
can
be
held
in
custody
pending
trial
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
while
he
is
--
while
he
is
under
a
finding
that
he's
incompetent
to
be
tried,
that's
the
real
issue
of
the
case,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
against
his
background,
wasn't
that
almost
imperative?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
they
--
didn't
they
know
his
medical
history?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
record
show
that
they
didn't
know
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
record
show?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
order
to
maintain
that
position,
you
would
in
effect
be
saying
that
a
psychiatrist
confronted
with
the
statement
that
he
did
or
may
have
committed
these
crimes,
and
that
this
was
his
explanation,
would
a
psychiatrist
would
not
say
that
this
man
should
be
subject
to
a
further
psychiatric
examination?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
shouldn't
they
have
done
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
standing
alone,
wouldn't
that
alert
any
doctor
even
if
he
were
not
a
psychiatrist
to
at
least
a
strong
suspicion
that
there
was
something
mentally
wrong
with
this
man?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
but
doesn't
this
put
them
on
notice
that
they
should
make
that
further
inquiry
about
his
capacity
to
cooperate
in
his
own
defense?
if
it
doesn't
then
the
laws
of
all
other
49
states
are
wrong
mr.
quinlan?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
did
you
--
did
you
undertake
to
have
him
examined
by
an
independent
psychiatrist
and
have
a
psychiatrist
testify
to
those
same
facts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
wouldn't
this
have
been
the
occasion
for
you
have
the
psychiatrist
at
least
indicate
the
objective
factors
that
would
show
capacities
or
understand
the
nature
of
the
charges
and
cooperate
with
counsel
in
defense?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that's
the
way
it's
done
everyday
in
the
week
in
a
great
many
places?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
you
went
to
trial
as
you
requested,
would
it
not
be
the
absolute
duty
of
the
court
against
all
of
this
background
to
see
to
it
that
he
had
a
psychiatric
examination
before
he
went
to
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
--
you
take
the
position
that
the
court
would
have
no
obligations?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
quinlan.
mr.
moss.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
--
how
was
that
gun
linked
up
to
the
defendant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
ballistics
tests
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
with
any?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
moss
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
moss,
how
does
pennsylvania
define
competency
to
stand
trial,
by
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
are
the
standards,
if
you
will?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
does
that
competency
to
stand
trial
or
for
commitment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
the
standard
for
judging
competency
to
stand
trial
or
is
that
the
standard
for
commitment
under
a
civil
proceeding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
i'm
getting
just
at
the
standards.
does
pennsylvania
have
a
statute
comparable
to
that
in
the
federal
statutes
describing
or
does
it
have
it
by
common
law,
describing
what
the
man
--
what
the
man's
condition
must
be
in
order
to
permit
him
to
go
to
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
he
went
to
the
common
police
court
with
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
he
would
have
to
sustain
some
burden
of
showing
what
you
contend
he
cannot
show
and
therefore,
the
common
police
court
would
likely
be
somewhat
influenced
by
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court's
holding,
would
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
counsel
indicated
that
he
did
not
elect
to
follow
that
course
originally.
is
there
any
reason
to
believe
on
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding,
he
would
be
anymore
inclined
to
put
in
the
testimony
of
a
psychiatrist?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
this
man
were
brought
to
trial
as
he
urges,
in
your
view,
would
it
be
the
obligation
of
the
prosecutor
to
bring
his
medical
history
to
the
attention
of
the
court
if
he
failed
to
do
so,
on
his
own
behalf?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
the
american
bar
association
standards
for
the
prosecution,
incumbent
to
the
prosecution,
would
say
that
you
had
an
absolute
duty
to
do
so.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
moss.
mr.
quinlan,
do
you
have
anything
further.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
mr.
quinlan,
there
the
basis
--
the
basic
finding
they
made
was
that
he's
not
competent
to
stand
trial
that
he
cannot
understand
and
cooperate,
doesn't
understand
the
nature
of
the
charges,
that's
why
he's
being
held
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
not
because
of
his
confession?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
counsel,
perhaps
you're
trying
to
have
it
both
ways
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
if
you
had
taken
the
stand,
if
you
had
taken
the
stand
in
this
hearing
and
testified
to
all
that
you
have
been
suggesting
to
us
outside
of
the
record
about
his
capacity,
his
understanding,
perhaps
that
commission
would've
found
that
he
was
competent
to
stand
trial
and
we
wouldn't
be
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
have
associate
counsel
there
who
could've
conducted
the
examination?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
prosecution
made
the
psychiatric
testimony.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
quinlan,
suppose
instead
of
that
route
that
justice
blackmun
suggested,
suppose
the
state
now,
decides
to
give
up
and
they
put
--
bring
your
man
into
the
common
police
court
for
trial.
against
this
background
have
you
any
doubt
that
this
--
that
the
common
police
judge
is
going
to
first
conduct
a
hearing
to
determine
for
himself
whether
your
client
is
competent
to
stand
trial
by
the
standards
of
the
common
law,
isn't
that
what
he's
going
to
do?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
if
he
decides
that
he's
not
competent
to
stand
trial,
he's
put
right
back
where
he
is
now
residing,
isn't
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
but
you
just
have
the
dissenters
on
your
side.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
your
time
is
up.
chief
