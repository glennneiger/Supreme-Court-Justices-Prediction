justice
potter
stewart
and
your
claim
basically,
as
i
understand
it,
your
really
sole
claim
mr.
quinlan
is
this
and
you
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong.
that
until
or
unless,
you
bring
to
the
attention,
you
as
the
defendant
or
his
counsel
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
trial
court
that
your
client
is
or
maybe
mentally
incompetent,
then
the
trial
court
under
the
constitution
has
an
absolute
duty
to
give
your
client
a
speedy,
public
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
and
could
do
nothing
else?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
it?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
the
prosecuting
attorney?
justice
potter
stewart
who
was
the
he
you're
talking
about,
the
prosecuting
attorney?
justice
potter
stewart
district
attorney,
keep
going.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
mr.
moss,
in
addition
to
that,
the
confessions
were
introduced
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
was
a
sanity
hearing
and
as
i
understand
it,
your
--
the
petitioner
doesn't
quarrel
with
the
procedural
due
process
aspects
of
that
hearing.
but
his
claim
is
that
once
his
client
was
indicted,
until
or
unless
he
raised
the
issue
of
his
client's
insanity
or
incompetence,
it
was
your
absolute
constitutional
duty
to
bring
him
to
trial
at
a
criminal
court,
a
speedy
and
a
public
trial,
that's
the
issue
here,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
only
one
as
i
understand
as
the
case
is
submitted
by
the
petitioner.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
his
point
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
our
procedure
in
this
country
and
in
pennsylvania
and
each
of
the
other
49
states
and
in
the
federal
system
that
our
procedure
for
better
or
for
worse
is
an
adversary
procedure,
an
adversary
system.
so
that
until
or
unless,
he
as
the
defendant
raises
the
issue
of
incompetence
or
insanity,
you
have
a
single
constitutional
duty,
having
indicted
him,
having
chosen
to
proceed
criminally
against
this
man,
having
him
charged
with
murder
and
indicted
him
for
it,
and
required
him
to
plea
that
you
have
an
absolute
constitutional
duty
to
bring
him
to
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
on
one
side
of
the
case
and
he's
on
the
other
and
it's
an
adversary
proceeding.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it's
not
your
duty
to
look
after
his
rights.
it's
his
duty
to
assert
them
if
he
wants
to.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
if
he's
psychotic
he
didn't
murder
them,
he
killed
them
maybe
but
he's
not
guilty
of
murder?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
then
he
practically
murdered,
if
the
facts
you
state
are
correct.
justice
potter
stewart
before
they're
going
to
interpose
the
defense
in
insanity,
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
until
unless
you
do,
there
will
be
no
psychiatrist
around.
justice
potter
stewart
you
want
to
get
these
criminal
charges
disposed
of
because
until
they
are,
the
army
will
not
take
him,
isn't
that
quite
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
the
reason
you're
making
this
claim
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
and
your
claim
basically,
as
i
understand
it,
your
really

mr.

or
his

bring
to
the

of

court
that

is

mentally
incompetent,
then
the
trial
court
under
the
constitution
has
an
absolute

give
your

a

public
trial?
justice
potter
stewart

attorney,
keep
