justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
then
just
ask
you,
i
take
it
that
when
--
when
your
client
was
committed
here
that
the
commission
that
was
convened
found
that
--
not
only
found
that
he
was
unfit
to
stand
trial,
but
that
he
had
criminal
tendencies,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
let's
assume
the
state
dropped
the
criminal
charges
against
your
client
right
now,
would
they
have
to
release
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
mean
the
commission
--
the
commission
that
is
--
enough
has
already
drawn
--
enough
has
already
happened
in
terms
of
proceedings
and
findings
to
warrant
his
confinement
even
if
there
were
no
criminal
charges
pending?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
your
claim
really
is
that
narrows
down
to
whether
or
not
you
can
prevent
a
person
from
having
a
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
if
he
were
tried
and
found
innocent,
he
stays
exactly
where
he
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
just
asked
you
a
minute
ago
that
if
the
state
dropped
its
charges
against
him,
whether
he
would
stay
exactly
where
he
is
and
you
said
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
are
enough
findings
already
made
to
justify
his
confinement
somewhere?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
no
one
who
is
committed
by
civil
proceedings
end
up
in
the
institution
that
he
is
now
in?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
find
he
has
criminal
tendency.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
--
the
commission
here
found
that
he
had
criminal
tendency?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
didn't
--
they
didn't
just
rest
as
i
understand
it
on
the
fact
that
he
was
charged
with
this
crime?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
basis
for
their
finding,
the
commission's
finding
that
he
had
criminal
tendencies?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
is
the
sanity
commission's
report,
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
printed
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it's
your
--
it's
your
position
i
take
it
that
in
an
examination
such
as
went
on
here,
in
connection
with
the
criminal
charge
to
see
if
he's
competent
to
stand
trial
that
you
were
privileged
not
to
have
him
testify.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
before
the
commission?
justice
byron
r.
white
whereas
you
wouldn't
have
in
a
civil
commitment
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
you
can
--
your
position
is
that
you
can
stop
the
psychiatrist
from
talking
with
your
client
in
order
to
decide
whether
he
was
competent
to
stand
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
ask
you.
let's
assume
you
tried
him
and
he
was
acquitted,
what
constitutional
rights
of
his
were
violated
during
the
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
the
trial.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
he
were
acquitted
he
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
he
wants
--
he
wants
to
say,
he
wants
to
say,
if
you
convict
me
maybe
you
convict
me
but
that
he
maybe
innocent?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
competency
standard
would
not
be
sufficient
in
the
civil
proceeding
to
confine
the
man?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
are
confining
him
--
what
more
than
just
that
competency
standard
is
at
trial
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
did
they
--
why
did
they
go
to
make
those
claims?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
did
they
go
on
--
why
did
they
go
on
and
make
those
findings
about
criminal
tendencies
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
perhaps
you've
already
said
it,
but
did
the
findings
that
the
commission
made
satisfy
the
civil
commitment
standards?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
civil
commitment
had
to
conclude
to
confine
a
person?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
under
the
civil
proceedings
he
wouldn't
even
have
to
found
to
be
--
to
have
criminal
tendencies?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
--
would
you
still
be
making
the
same
argument
if
all
the
commission
had
found
was
that
he
is
incapable
of
understanding
the
situation,
with
--
with
which
he
is
faced
and
he's
incapable
of
cooperating
with
the
counsel
and
the
commission
had
not
gone
on
and
found
that
he
had
criminal
tendencies?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
but
it
was
sufficient
to
satisfy
your
incompetency,
incompetent
to
stand
trial
standard
in
pennsylvania.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
that's
the
more
interesting
--
simply
more
interesting
question
which
is
perhaps,
you
can't
reach
here
because
the
commission
also
found
the
criminal
tendencies,
but
would
you
say
pennsylvania
could
continue
to
hold
a
person
for
the
rest
of
his
life
without
a
trial
just
because
you
found
that
he
was
incompetent
to
stand
trial
and
he
would
never
get
any
better?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
do
in
pennsylvania?
instead
that
you'd
have
to
civilly
commit
him,
if
you
want
to
know
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
everybody
concedes
that
the
findings
are
valid,
both
the
defense
and
prosecution
that
he's
incompetent
to
stand
trial,
but
it's
not
found
that
he's
danger
to
himself
or
anybody
else,now
would
you
say
you
can
still
continue
to
hold
him
just
because
you
had
charge
against
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
couldn't,
if
he's
incompetent
to
stand
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
what
would
you
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
stay
where
he
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
without
any
more
findings
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
that
would
bring
up
whether
or
not
there
should
be
a
civil
commitment?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
he
end
up
exactly
where
he
is
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
you
deal
with
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
be
satisfied
if
they
didn't
try
him,
they
didn't
filed
(inaudible)
the
charge.
justice
byron
r.
white
he'd
still
stay
where
he
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
that
pennsylvania
has
gone
through
without
proceeding
without
waiting
to
hold
him
except
during
the
pendency
of
the
trial?
justice
