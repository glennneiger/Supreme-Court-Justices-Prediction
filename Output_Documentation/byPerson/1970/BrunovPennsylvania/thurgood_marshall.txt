justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
quinlan,
how
do
you
count
the
fact
that
he's
still
there
and
haven't
been
released
yet?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
he
is
insane
and
if
he
never
gets
sane,
they
will
not
release
him.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
this
is
the
independent
hurdle
which
is
the
hospital.
i
assume
it's
found
that
he's
insane.
the
reason
i
say
that
is
because
he's
still
there
and
is
it
not
true
that
if
they
find
him
sane,
they
will
release
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
i
mean.
well,
they
have
nothing.
justice
thurgood
marshall

all
state
institutions
aren't
illegal?
justice
thurgood
marshall

also
understand
you
haven't
tried
to
get
it,

asked
you,

tried
--
justice

justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
assume
now
that
this
court
grants
you
the
relief
you

and
he
is
brought
back
in,
where
is
he
going
to
be
brought,
to
the
criminal
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
suppose
they
--
obviously,
they're
insane
in
the
courtroom
than
what
happens?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah,
six
psychiatrists
waiting
to
testify
to
say
that
man
--
