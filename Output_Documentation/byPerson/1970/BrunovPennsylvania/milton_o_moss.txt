mr.
milton
o.
moss
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
there
are
certain
factors
that
have
been
presented
to
the
court
by
my
opponent
that
should
be
clarified.
i
think
that
your
honors
will
accurately
find
within
the
record
a
complete
safeguard
of
every
constitutional
right
of
this
defendant
in
the
procedures
that
were
taken
against
him
by
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
through
the
district
attorney's
office
of
montgomery
county.
we
have
heard
from
mr.
quinlan
that
the
only
piece
of
evidence
that
the
commonwealth
had
in
the
prosecution
for
five
murder
cases
was
in
fact
an
alleged
illegal
--
illegally
obtained
confession.
it
should
be
noted
your
honors,
that
this
defendant
was
operated
--
was
arrested
in
april
of
1966.
on
approximately
may
13,
1966
or
one
month
prior
to
the
miranda
decision
that
negated
the
validity
and
admissibility
of
the
confession,
the
district
attorney
of
the
county
of
montgomery
filed
a
petition
with
the
court
having
full
knowledge
not
only
of
the
defendant's
present
state
of
mind
and
incompetence,
but
also
his
prior
psychiatric
background.
as
a
result
of
his
knowledge
and
i
suggest
to
the
court,
his
obligation
to
the
court
and
law
generally
and
as
a
quasi-judicial
officer,
it
was
his
obligation
to
protect
--
mr.
milton
o.
moss
pardon
me.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
the
district
attorney,
yes
sir.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
petitioned
the
court
on
his
motion
as
i
felt
he
was
required
to
do
to
empanel
a
sanity
commission
under
the
mental
health
act
at
that
time,
and
this
was
opposed
by
defense
counsel.
previous
to
that
issue,
your
honors
will
find
in
the
docket
entries
of
this
case
that
a
suppression
hearing
was
in
fact
held.
evidence
presented
to
the
court
and
a
ruling
given
as
to
the
admissibility
of
evidence
other
than
the
confession.
namely
the
admissibility
of
a
gun
that
was
located
and
found,
pursuant
to
a
valid
search
warrant
issued
by
the
court,
at
the
room
occupied
by
the
defendant.
subsequent
to
the
obtaining
of
the
gun
by
the
police,
the
confession
was
obtained
from
the
defendant,
setting
forth
his
involvement
with
the
five
murders
starting
in
1961
and
ending
in
1966.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
the
gun
was
stolen
from
a
sears
and
roebuck
store
your
honor,
back
in
1960
or
1961.
it
was
found
in
a
drawer
secreted
under
a
table,
in
a
box
that
was
obtained
by
the
defendant
and
retained
in
that
box
along
with
various
shells
for
use.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
balistically
--
mr.
milton
o.
moss
--
it
would
bear
out
the
fact
that
this
gun,
in
fact,
was
used
to
kill
as
i
recall
at
least
three
of
the
defendants.
now,
in
addition
to
the
gun,
your
honors,
there
was
additional
evidence
that
was
introduced
by
the
commonwealth
to
the
sanity
commission
and
that
was
a
list
of
seven
names
that
had
been
retained
by
the
defendant,
during
these
prior
years
to
1966,
of
seven
names
that
he
alleged
and
held
responsible
for
the
psychotic
condition
of
his
mother.
and
it
was
his
purpose
in
life
to
murder
and
annihilate
all
seven
on
that
list,
in
order
to
relieve
the
“evil
eye,
hex
voodoo
and
witchcraft”
that
these
individuals,
all
of
whom
were
friendly
with
the
defendant's
family
had
imposed
upon
her
and
subjected
her
to
this
type
of
life.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
yes
sir.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
mr.
justice
--
mr.
milton
o.
moss
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
think
that
that
is
the
pinhead
of
this
case.
it's
the
essence
of
the
legal
issue
that
brings
us
before
this
honorable
court.
and
i
think
that
this,
as
the
court
has
held,
in
previous
cases
is
not
an
absolute
right.
we
cannot
subject
an
incompetent
individual
to
a
speedy
trial
when
he
is
incapable
and
unable
to
confer
meaningfully
with
his
counsel
to
exercise
all
of
the
constitutional
rights
that
he
must
do
personally
in
the
course
of
a
trial
when
he
is
unable
to
do
so.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
to
do
this
would
subject
him
to
an
unfair
trial.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
i
think
that
--
mr.
milton
o.
moss
i
think
there
is
certain
--
mr.
milton
o.
moss
we
are
aware
of
his
position,
mr.
justice
stewart,
and
we
have
opposed
that
for
numerous
reasons.
i
think
that
the
court
can
readily
agree
that
there
are
numerous
issues
that
would
violate
the
individual's
rights
himself.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
not
necessarily
sir.
he
would
be
subjected
to
the
same
type
of
disposition
if
he
were
convicted,
acquitted,
acquitted
on
the
grounds
of
insanity
or
committed
pursuant
to
a
civil
commitment
procedure
provided
for
in
the
very
same
act
that
we
proceeded
on.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
during
the
trial
--
mr.
milton
o.
moss
i
think
this
court,
your
honor,
has
stated
frequently
that
the
rights
to
participate
and
actually
decide
intelligently
on
the
various
issues
of
a
trial.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
not
necessarily.
we
have
a
valid,
bona
fide
criminal
charge
against
him.
in
contrast
to
what
mr.
quinlan
has
advised
the
court,
we
have
sufficient
evidence
to
proceed
and
convict
this
man.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
well,
i
think
the
law
over
the
years
has
generally
encouraged
useful
acts.
if
we
are
going
to
permit
this
defendant
to
order
society,
to
subject
him
to
trial
when
he
is
unable
to
comprehend
the
nature
of
the
charges,
the
offense
itself
or
cooperate
with
his
counsel
in
any
type
of
intelligent
or
meaningful
fashion.
we
will
override
the
protection
that
society
has
afforded
him
in
the
past
and
that
is
that
he
just
could
not
meaningfully
participate
and
why
subject
him
--
mr.
milton
o.
moss
--
to
a
trial
on
the
merits
and
then
thereafter
allow
him
to
raise
the
incompetency
issue.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
by
statute,
your
honor,
it's
under
the
mental
health
act.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
the
standard
is
this.
it
uses
the
term
mental
disability.
it
says
mental
disability
means
any
mental
illness,
mental
impairment,
mental
retardation
or
mental
deficiency
which
so
lessens
the
capacity
of
a
person
to
use
his
customary
self-control,
judgment
and
discretion
in
the
conduct
of
his
affairs
and
social
relations
as
to
make
it
necessary
or
advisable
for
him
to
be
under
care
as
provided
in
this
act.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
that
is
the
standard
for
commitment.
it
is
bolstered
further
by
psychiatric
reports
and
evaluations
--
mr.
milton
o.
moss
the
standard
that
is
used
your
honor
is
the
common
law
standard
of
ability
to
comprehend
the
nature
and
consequences
of
his
act,
and
of
the
charges,
to
cooperate
meaningfully
and
intelligently
with
his
counsel,
and
to
comprehend
the
course
of
the
trial
and
his
rights,
that's
by
common
law
and
case
law.
the
procedure
that
i
read
to
you,
your
honor,
is
solely
the
method
and
the
standard
by
which
a
commitment
maybe
pursued
either
for
a
civil
commitment
or
by
a
criminal
--
after
a
criminal
charge.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
i
would
not
think
so,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
his
criminal
tendencies,
his
lack
of
self-control.
his
assertions
--
mr.
milton
o.
moss
i'm
sorry.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
because
they
were
part
of
the
testimony
and
evidence
that
was
introduced
and
actually
was
in
fact
the
criminal
charge
triggered
the
attention
of
the
public
to
this
man's
conduct
and
incompetency.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
i
think
there's
been
no
definite
determination
on
that
issue,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
because
of
the
pendency
of
these
various
proceedings.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
the
eventual
place
of
commitment,
your
honor
will
be
the
very
same.
this
course
of
treatment
will
be
the
very
same.
this
is
not
as
it
has
been
referred,
a
confinement
facility.
this
is
a
hospital,
part
of
the
hospital
system
of
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
and
he
would
be
there
primarily
because
of
the
maximum
security
and
protection
for
society
that
is
necessary
from
this
individual.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
he
would
end
up
here,
mr.
justice
blackmun
under
any
circumstances
imaginable
either
as
a
result
of
criminal
trials
and
the
verdicts
that
would
be
rendered
by
that
jury
or
through
civil
commitment.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
no,
under
a
sanity
commission,
this
defendant
has
a
right
to
pursue
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
at
any
stage
of
the
proceedings
when
he
is
or
at
least
represents
that
he
is
competent
to
be
released,
remanded
back
to
the
trial
level
to
stand
trial
on
the
charges.
this
has
not
been
pursued
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
is
a
letter
of
the
defendant's
current
status.
he
is
evaluated
periodically
to
determine
his
competency
to
stand
trial
and
answer
the
criminal
charges.
this
has
not
been
pursued
in
the
last
three-and-a-half
years
since
his
commitment
by
order.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
this
defendant
has
a
right
not
only
pursue
the
matter
on
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
but
can
be
examined
by
his
own
physician,
unrelated
to
the
institution
where
he
is
committed
and
present
evidence
on
his
own
behalf
as
to
his
competency.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
if
the
contents
of
this
defendant's
psychiatric
reports,
periodic
reports,
and
evaluations
by
farview
state
hospital
are
as
they
are,
as
of
september
28,
1970,
he
would
not
have
any
success
in
any
release.
this
man
is
convinced
of
his
dedication
in
life
to
annihilate
the
seven
on
his
list
and
in
the
event
this
brings
no
relief
to
his
psychotic
mother
he
will
find
and
search
out
other
people
in
the
community
whom
he
feels
is
responsible
for
his
mother's
condition
and
this
is
so
stated
in
the
record.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
yes,
sir.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
whenever
a
person
is
believed
to
be
mentally
disabled
and
in
need
of
care
or
treatment
by
reason
of
such
mental
disability
and
examination
of
person
has
been
made
by
a
physician
or
physicians
or
for
any
reason,
the
examination
of
such
person
cannot
be
made,
a
petition
maybe
presented
to
the
court
of
common
police
of
the
county
in
which
the
person
resides
or
his
for
his
immediate
examination
or
commitment
to
an
appropriate
facility
for
examination,
observation,
and
diagnosis.
and
they
thereafter
adopt
the
same
type
of
mental
disability
standard
by
which
the
individual
would
be
committed.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
we
have
an
exaggerated
case
here
of
an
individual
who
was
terribly
psychotic,
has
in
fact
murdered
five
people
and
is
destined
to
murder
others
if
released
upon
society.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
that
is
true.
i
think
the
commonwealth
in
any
proceeding
would
acknowledge
the
defendant's
incompetency
and
insanity.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
and
if
we
were
to
do
this
sir
and
a
court
would
precede
the
trial
regardless
of
the
verdict
that
would
be
entered.
this
defendant
would
be
committed
to
farview
state
hospital
for
treatment
and
rehabilitation
and/or
release.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
mr.
chief
justice,
i've
weighed
that
very
problem
and
i
have
kicked
it
around
in
my
own
mind
as
to
whether
or
not
it
is
my
obligation.
i
suggest
to
your
honor
that
this
would
be
my
obligation
in
the
event
that
the
defense
counsel
gave
no
indication
of
raising
an
insanity
defense.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
i
believe
that,
i
think
my
inclination
was
consistent
with
the
standards
of
ethics,
but
i
feel
that
it
is
the
obligation
of
the
prosecution
to
interpose
any
favorable
type
of
evidence
that
is
in
our
possession
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it's
in
the
possession
of
the
defendant
as
well
and
at
no
time,
other
than
today
have
i
been
aware
of
mr.
quinlan's
assertion
of
his
knowledge
of
that
insanity
defense.
i
think
we
have
a
counsel
for
the
defendant
in
this
case
who
may
not
be
counsel
throughout
the
entire
proceedings
on
this
case
and
we
are
not
assured
of
the
defendant's
full
protection
by
his
being
speeding
to
trial
when
he
is
unable
to
really
comprehend
the
charges
and
it
would
only
take
a
moment
--
mr.
milton
o.
moss
and
that
was
the
only
finding
--
mr.
milton
o.
moss
it
would
depend
on
what
other
information
we
would
have
available
to
us
in
evaluating
whether
we
should
proceed.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
in
view
--
mr.
milton
o.
moss
if
we
wanted
to
do
that
or
if
we
were
not
satisfied
with
the
validity
of
those
findings,
we
would
proceed
to
the
trial
--
mr.
milton
o.
moss
we
would
probably
proceed
to
trial.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
those
were
the
only
findings
we
would
not
--
mr.
milton
o.
moss
we
would
just
proceed
on
his
--
mr.
milton
o.
moss
yes,
sir.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
eventually,
i
can
tell
you
by
practice,
your
honor
that
what
the
commonwealth
does
is
relieve
the
defendant
at
some
time
of
the
criminal
charges
by
now
pressing
the
charges
against
him.
when
we
--
mr.
milton
o.
moss
that
normally
is
injunction
with
the
findings,
recommendations,
and
reports
that
are
submitted
to
us
periodically
by
the
institution
itself.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
unfortunately,
mr.
justice
black,
he
was
not
apprehended
by
the
police
until
1966,
after
his
fifth
murder.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
that's
correct
and
it
was
at
that
time
that
we
proceeded
with
our
action.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
yes,
sir.
we
suggest
to
the
court
that
we
do
have
a
conflict
between
the
right
of
a
fair
trial
and
the
right
of
a
speedy
trial.
there
are
numerous
reasons
why
we
would
not
want
to
subject
the
defendant
to
the
speedy
trial.
the
court
has
definitely
that
to
proceed
and
prosecute
a
defendant
who
was
incompetent
violates
due
process
and
we
are
not
violating
the
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
we
are
merely
differing
it
until
such
time
that
the
defendant
can
exercise
in
conjunction
with
his
counsel,
the
personal
constitutional
rights
that
he
must
decide
upon
during
the
course
of
a
trial.
we
feel
that
the
standards
by
which
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
proceeds
in
matters
of
this
type
afford
him
every
protection
and
we
therefore
suggest
to
this
court
that
this
defendant
is
not
competent
and
not
able
to
proceed
for
trial,
in
spite
of
the
recommendations
or
assertions
of
his
defense
counsel.
thank
you.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
there
are
certain
factors
that
have
been
presented
to
the
court
by
my
opponent
that
should
be
clarified.
i
think
that
your
honors
will
accurately
find
within
the
record
a
complete
safeguard
of
every
constitutional
right
of
this
defendant
in
the
procedures
that
were
taken
against
him
by
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
through
the
district
attorney's
office
of
montgomery
county.
we
have
heard
from
mr.
quinlan
that
the
only
piece
of
evidence
that
the
commonwealth
had
in
the
prosecution
for
five
murder
cases
was
in
fact
an
alleged
illegal
--
illegally
obtained
confession.
it
should
be
noted
your
honors,
that
this
defendant
was
operated
--
was
arrested
in
april
of
1966.
on
approximately
may
13,
1966
or
one
month
prior
to
the
miranda
decision
that
negated
the
validity
and
admissibility
of
the
confession,
the
district
attorney
of
the
county
of
montgomery
filed
a
petition
with
the
court
having
full
knowledge
not
only
of
the
defendant's
present
state
of
mind
and
incompetence,
but
also
his
prior
psychiatric
background.
as
a
result
of
his
knowledge
and
i
suggest
to
the
court,
his
obligation
to
the
court
and
law
generally
and
as
a
quasi-judicial
officer,
it
was
his
obligation
to
protect
--
mr.
milton
o.
moss
pardon
me.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
the
district
attorney,
yes
sir.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
petitioned
the
court
on
his
motion
as
i
felt
he
was
required
to
do
to
empanel
a
sanity
commission
under
the
mental
health
act
at
that
time,
and
this
was
opposed
by
defense
counsel.
previous
to
that
issue,
your
honors
will
find
in
the
docket
entries
of
this
case
that
a
suppression
hearing
was
in
fact
held.
evidence
presented
to
the
court
and
a
ruling
given
as
to
the
admissibility
of
evidence
other
than
the
confession.
namely
the
admissibility
of
a
gun
that
was
located
and
found,
pursuant
to
a
valid
search
warrant
issued
by
the
court,
at
the
room
occupied
by
the
defendant.
subsequent
to
the
obtaining
of
the
gun
by
the
police,
the
confession
was
obtained
from
the
defendant,
setting
forth
his
involvement
with
the
five
murders
starting
in
1961
and
ending
in
1966.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
the
gun
was
stolen
from
a
sears
and
roebuck
store
your
honor,
back
in
1960
or
1961.
it
was
found
in
a
drawer
secreted
under
a
table,
in
a
box
that
was
obtained
by
the
defendant
and
retained
in
that
box
along
with
various
shells
for
use.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
balistically
--
mr.
milton
o.
moss
--
it
would
bear
out
the
fact
that
this
gun,
in
fact,
was
used
to
kill
as
i
recall
at
least
three
of
the
defendants.
now,
in
addition
to
the
gun,
your
honors,
there
was
additional
evidence
that
was
introduced
by
the
commonwealth
to
the
sanity
commission
and
that
was
a
list
of
seven
names
that
had
been
retained
by
the
defendant,
during
these
prior
years
to
1966,
of
seven
names
that
he
alleged
and
held
responsible
for
the
psychotic
condition
of
his
mother.
and
it
was
his
purpose
in
life
to
murder
and
annihilate
all
seven
on
that
list,
in
order
to
relieve
the
“evil
eye,
hex
voodoo
and
witchcraft”
that
these
individuals,
all
of
whom
were
friendly
with
the
defendant's
family
had
imposed
upon
her
and
subjected
her
to
this
type
of
life.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
yes
sir.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
mr.
justice
--
mr.
milton
o.
moss
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
think
that
that
is
the
pinhead
of
this
case.
it's
the
essence
of
the
legal
issue
that
brings
us
before
this
honorable
court.
and
i
think
that
this,
as
the
court
has
held,
in
previous
cases
is
not
an
absolute
right.
we
cannot
subject
an
incompetent
individual
to
a
speedy
trial
when
he
is
incapable
and
unable
to
confer
meaningfully
with
his
counsel
to
exercise
all
of
the
constitutional
rights
that
he
must
do
personally
in
the
course
of
a
trial
when
he
is
unable
to
do
so.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
to
do
this
would
subject
him
to
an
unfair
trial.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
i
think
that
--
mr.
milton
o.
moss
i
think
there
is
certain
--
mr.
milton
o.
moss
we
are
aware
of
his
position,
mr.
justice
stewart,
and
we
have
opposed
that
for
numerous
reasons.
i
think
that
the
court
can
readily
agree
that
there
are
numerous
issues
that
would
violate
the
individual's
rights
himself.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
not
necessarily
sir.
he
would
be
subjected
to
the
same
type
of
disposition
if
he
were
convicted,
acquitted,
acquitted
on
the
grounds
of
insanity
or
committed
pursuant
to
a
civil
commitment
procedure
provided
for
in
the
very
same
act
that
we
proceeded
on.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
during
the
trial
--
mr.
milton
o.
moss
i
think
this
court,
your
honor,
has
stated
frequently
that
the
rights
to
participate
and
actually
decide
intelligently
on
the
various
issues
of
a
trial.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
not
necessarily.
we
have
a
valid,
bona
fide
criminal
charge
against
him.
in
contrast
to
what
mr.
quinlan
has
advised
the
court,
we
have
sufficient
evidence
to
proceed
and
convict
this
man.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
well,
i
think
the
law
over
the
years
has
generally
encouraged
useful
acts.
if
we
are
going
to
permit
this
defendant
to
order
society,
to
subject
him
to
trial
when
he
is
unable
to
comprehend
the
nature
of
the
charges,
the
offense
itself
or
cooperate
with
his
counsel
in
any
type
of
intelligent
or
meaningful
fashion.
we
will
override
the
protection
that
society
has
afforded
him
in
the
past
and
that
is
that
he
just
could
not
meaningfully
participate
and
why
subject
him
--
mr.
milton
o.
moss
--
to
a
trial
on
the
merits
and
then
thereafter
allow
him
to
raise
the
incompetency
issue.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
by
statute,
your
honor,
it's
under
the
mental
health
act.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
the
standard
is
this.
it
uses
the
term
mental
disability.
it
says
mental
disability
means
any
mental
illness,
mental
impairment,
mental
retardation
or
mental
deficiency
which
so
lessens
the
capacity
of
a
person
to
use
his
customary
self-control,
judgment
and
discretion
in
the
conduct
of
his
affairs
and
social
relations
as
to
make
it
necessary
or
advisable
for
him
to
be
under
care
as
provided
in
this
act.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
that
is
the
standard
for
commitment.
it
is
bolstered
further
by
psychiatric
reports
and
evaluations
--
mr.
milton
o.
moss
the
standard
that
is
used
your
honor
is
the
common
law
standard
of
ability
to
comprehend
the
nature
and
consequences
of
his
act,
and
of
the
charges,
to
cooperate
meaningfully
and
intelligently
with
his
counsel,
and
to
comprehend
the
course
of
the
trial
and
his
rights,
that's
by
common
law
and
case
law.
the
procedure
that
i
read
to
you,
your
honor,
is
solely
the
method
and
the
standard
by
which
a
commitment
maybe
pursued
either
for
a
civil
commitment
or
by
a
criminal
--
after
a
criminal
charge.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
i
would
not
think
so,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
his
criminal
tendencies,
his
lack
of
self-control.
his
assertions
--
mr.
milton
o.
moss
i'm
sorry.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
because
they
were
part
of
the
testimony
and
evidence
that
was
introduced
and
actually
was
in
fact
the
criminal
charge
triggered
the
attention
of
the
public
to
this
man's
conduct
and
incompetency.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
i
think
there's
been
no
definite
determination
on
that
issue,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
because
of
the
pendency
of
these
various
proceedings.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
the
eventual
place
of
commitment,
your
honor
will
be
the
very
same.
this
course
of
treatment
will
be
the
very
same.
this
is
not
as
it
has
been
referred,
a
confinement
facility.
this
is
a
hospital,
part
of
the
hospital
system
of
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
and
he
would
be
there
primarily
because
of
the
maximum
security
and
protection
for
society
that
is
necessary
from
this
individual.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
he
would
end
up
here,
mr.
justice
blackmun
under
any
circumstances
imaginable
either
as
a
result
of
criminal
trials
and
the
verdicts
that
would
be
rendered
by
that
jury
or
through
civil
commitment.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
no,
under
a
sanity
commission,
this
defendant
has
a
right
to
pursue
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
at
any
stage
of
the
proceedings
when
he
is
or
at
least
represents
that
he
is
competent
to
be
released,
remanded
back
to
the
trial
level
to
stand
trial
on
the
charges.
this
has
not
been
pursued
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
is
a
letter
of
the
defendant's
current
status.
he
is
evaluated
periodically
to
determine
his
competency
to
stand
trial
and
answer
the
criminal
charges.
this
has
not
been
pursued
in
the
last
three-and-a-half
years
since
his
commitment
by
order.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
this
defendant
has
a
right
not
only
pursue
the
matter
on
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
but
can
be
examined
by
his
own
physician,
unrelated
to
the
institution
where
he
is
committed
and
present
evidence
on
his
own
behalf
as
to
his
competency.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
if
the
contents
of
this
defendant's
psychiatric
reports,
periodic
reports,
and
evaluations
by
farview
state
hospital
are
as
they
are,
as
of
september
28,
1970,
he
would
not
have
any
success
in
any
release.
this
man
is
convinced
of
his
dedication
in
life
to
annihilate
the
seven
on
his
list
and
in
the
event
this
brings
no
relief
to
his
psychotic
mother
he
will
find
and
search
out
other
people
in
the
community
whom
he
feels
is
responsible
for
his
mother's
condition
and
this
is
so
stated
in
the
record.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
yes,
sir.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
whenever
a
person
is
believed
to
be
mentally
disabled
and
in
need
of
care
or
treatment
by
reason
of
such
mental
disability
and
examination
of
person
has
been
made
by
a
physician
or
physicians
or
for
any
reason,
the
examination
of
such
person
cannot
be
made,
a
petition
maybe
presented
to
the
court
of
common
police
of
the
county
in
which
the
person
resides
or
his
for
his
immediate
examination
or
commitment
to
an
appropriate
facility
for
examination,
observation,
and
diagnosis.
and
they
thereafter
adopt
the
same
type
of
mental
disability
standard
by
which
the
individual
would
be
committed.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
we
have
an
exaggerated
case
here
of
an
individual
who
was
terribly
psychotic,
has
in
fact
murdered
five
people
and
is
destined
to
murder
others
if
released
upon
society.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
that
is
true.
i
think
the
commonwealth
in
any
proceeding
would
acknowledge
the
defendant's
incompetency
and
insanity.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
and
if
we
were
to
do
this
sir
and
a
court
would
precede
the
trial
regardless
of
the
verdict
that
would
be
entered.
this
defendant
would
be
committed
to
farview
state
hospital
for
treatment
and
rehabilitation
and/or
release.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
mr.
chief
justice,
i've
weighed
that
very
problem
and
i
have
kicked
it
around
in
my
own
mind
as
to
whether
or
not
it
is
my
obligation.
i
suggest
to
your
honor
that
this
would
be
my
obligation
in
the
event
that
the
defense
counsel
gave
no
indication
of
raising
an
insanity
defense.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
i
believe
that,
i
think
my
inclination
was
consistent
with
the
standards
of
ethics,
but
i
feel
that
it
is
the
obligation
of
the
prosecution
to
interpose
any
favorable
type
of
evidence
that
is
in
our
possession
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it's
in
the
possession
of
the
defendant
as
well
and
at
no
time,
other
than
today
have
i
been
aware
of
mr.
quinlan's
assertion
of
his
knowledge
of
that
insanity
defense.
i
think
we
have
a
counsel
for
the
defendant
in
this
case
who
may
not
be
counsel
throughout
the
entire
proceedings
on
this
case
and
we
are
not
assured
of
the
defendant's
full
protection
by
his
being
speeding
to
trial
when
he
is
unable
to
really
comprehend
the
charges
and
it
would
only
take
a
moment
--
mr.
milton
o.
moss
and
that
was
the
only
finding
--
mr.
milton
o.
moss
it
would
depend
on
what
other
information
we
would
have
available
to
us
in
evaluating
whether
we
should
proceed.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
in
view
--
mr.
milton
o.
moss
if
we
wanted
to
do
that
or
if
we
were
not
satisfied
with
the
validity
of
those
findings,
we
would
proceed
to
the
trial
--
mr.
milton
o.
moss
we
would
probably
proceed
to
trial.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
those
were
the
only
findings
we
would
not
--
mr.
milton
o.
moss
we
would
just
proceed
on
his
--
mr.
milton
o.
moss
yes,
sir.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
eventually,
i
can
tell
you
by
practice,
your
honor
that
what
the
commonwealth
does
is
relieve
the
defendant
at
some
time
of
the
criminal
charges
by
now
pressing
the
charges
against
him.
when
we
--
mr.
milton
o.
moss
that
normally
is
injunction
with
the
findings,
recommendations,
and
reports
that
are
submitted
to
us
periodically
by
the
institution
itself.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
unfortunately,
mr.
justice
black,
he
was
not
apprehended
by
the
police
until
1966,
after
his
fifth
murder.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
that's
correct
and
it
was
at
that
time
that
we
proceeded
with
our
action.
mr.
milton
o.
moss
yes,
sir.
we
suggest
to
the
court
that
we
do
have
a
conflict
between
the
right
of
a
fair
trial
and
the
right
of
a
speedy
trial.
there
are
numerous
reasons
why
we
would
not
want
to
subject
the
defendant
to
the
speedy
trial.
the
court
has
definitely
that
to
proceed
and
prosecute
a
defendant
who
was
incompetent
violates
due
process
and
we
are
not
violating
the
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
we
are
merely
differing
it
until
such
time
that
the
defendant
can
exercise
in
conjunction
with
his
counsel,
the
personal
constitutional
rights
that
he
must
decide
upon
during
the
course
of
a
trial.
we
feel
that
the
standards
by
which
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
proceeds
in
matters
of
this
type
afford
him
every
protection
and
we
therefore
suggest
to
this
court
that
this
defendant
is
not
competent
and
not
able
to
proceed
for
trial,
in
spite
of
the
recommendations
or
assertions
of
his
defense
counsel.
thank
you.
