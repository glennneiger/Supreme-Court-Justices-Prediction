justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
quinlan,
how
long
have
you
had
this
sanity
commission
procedure
in
pennsylvania?
is
this
a
long,
established
routine
in
criminal
cases?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
me
follow
through
on
my
inquiry.
you
say
you
had
it
since
1951.
to
what
extent
--
well,
let
me
ask
this,
do
you
have
a
procedure
for
civil
commitment?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
pennsylvania?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
how
do
the
two
procedures
differ?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
do
i
understand
that
the
sanity
hearing
and
the
civil
commitment
procedure
are
or
are
not
different
in
pennsylvania?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
at
the
time
with
this
man,
were
they
the
same
at
the
time?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
one
further
question;
would
he
be
likely
to
end
up
in
a
different
institution
under
the
sanity
hearing
than
he
would
if
he
were
civilly
committed?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
now
is
he
likely
to
end
there,
had
he
been
civilly
committed
in
the
same
institution?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
now,
one
further
question
and
then
i'll
stop.
are
you
familiar
with
the
federal
procedure
under
18
u.s.c.
4244?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
my
question
is
and
i'd
be
interested
in
your
reaction
ultimately,
is
whether
if
you
prevail
here,
the
federal
system
is
placed
in
jeopardy,
constitutionally?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
i
thought
you
said
the
same
--
gave
the
same
answer
to
the
question
i
asked
you?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
moss,
why
has
he
not
been
civilly
committed
in
the
meantime?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
me
then
ask
you
the
same
question
i
asked
mr.
quinlan.
is
the
ultimate
result
the
same
to
it,
incarceration
if
we
can
call
it
that
anyway
placement
in
same
type
of
institution
whether
the
route
followed
is
that
of
civil
commitment
or
that
of
a
criminal
sanity
hearing?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
then
your
answer
to
my
first
question
would
not
be
to
with
there
is
no
civil
commitment
procedure
because
it
would
be
useless.
he's
already
where
he
would
end
up?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
now,
one
last
question.
is
the
release
standard
the
same
under
confinement
because
of
the
sanity
commission's
and
the
court's
determination
as
it
would
be
after
civil
commitment?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
quinlan,
as
i
understand
that
the
relief
you're
requesting
is
an
order
requiring
that
he'd
be
put
to
trial.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
now
suppose
that
this
relief
were
granted
and
the
state
moved
as
mr.
moss
said,
he
had
the
power
to
move
for
a
civil
commitment,
would
you
oppose
this?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
they
do
have
to
do
this?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
me
get
back
to
my
question.
suppose
they
moved
for
a
--
started
the
machinery
running
for
a
civil
commitment,
what
would
be
your
response
as
his
counsel?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
