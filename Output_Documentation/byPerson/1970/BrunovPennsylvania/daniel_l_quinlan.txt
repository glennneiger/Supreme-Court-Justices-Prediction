mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
john
harry
bruno
was
born
and
raised
in
the
borough
of
norristown
which
is
about
20
miles
west
of
philadelphia
and
the
records
in
this
case
show
that
he
attended
public
school.
it
was
elicited
to
the
various
hearings,
habeas
corpus
hearings,
suppression
hearings,
insanity
hearings
that
he
had
never
been
in
trouble.
low
and
behold,
he
was
drafted
by
the
united
states
army
in
november
of
1961
and
at
some
point
during
his
basic
training,
abbreviated
as
it
was,
it
was
determined
that
john
was
unlike
the
other
draftees
that
he
was
sick
and
he
was
transferred
to
fitzsimons
general
hospital
in
denver,
colorado
where
he
was
in
a
psychiatric
ward.
he
was
discharged
by
the
united
states
army
in
may
of
1961
and
sent
home
by
himself.
now
prior
to
that,
a
murder
had
taken
place
in
october
of
1961
in
norristown,
montgomery
county,
pennsylvania,
husband
and
wife
were
killed.
subsequent
to
john's
discharge
from
the
army,
he
held
jobs
in
norristown.
he
was
not
in
any
trouble
that
anybody
knows
of,
although
the
records
does
show
that
subsequent
to
december
of
1963
when
two
other
people
were
murdered,
john
was
interrogated
by
the
county
detectives
and/or
the
district
attorney's
office
and
now
it's
1964
and
given
a
lie
detector
test.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
well,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes,
sir.
from
the
very
beginning,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
entered
my
appearance
within
a
week
or
10
days
the
district
attorney
--
the
district
attorney
petitioned
for
a
sanity
commission,
alleging
that
john
was
insane
and
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
no
sir.
all
they
had
--
all
they
had
to
base
their
petition
on
was
the
confession
that
they
elicited
from
john
bruno
when
they
held
him
for
26
hours
without
a
lawyer.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
no
sir,
they
did
not.
they
subpoenaed
his
medical
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
at
that
point
they
didn't
know
it.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
i
believe
it
does,
mr.
chief
justice,
yes.
the
records
of
his
medical
records
were
not
brought
into
the
picture
until
the
sanity
commission
actually
sat
in
1967
and
they
subpoenaed
them
by
the
order
--
the
record
also
show
that
one
judge
tranquility
signed
all
of
the
orders
in
this
case.
now,
i
resisted
the
appointment
of
the
sanity
commission,
at
the
same
time
i
filed
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
hearing
to
find
out
what
they
did
have
against
john
bruno.
as
mr.
justice
roberts
said,
at
that
first
appeal
in
the
state
supreme
court,
“how
in
the
world
can
they
can
take
an
illegal
confession
and
hold
it
here,
and
say,
if
john
bruno
did
these
terrible
things
for
the
reasons
that
he
gave
for
doing
them,
then
he
must
be
crazy.”
now,
if
the
confession
is
inadmissible
in
a
courtroom,
it
should
not
have
been
used
for
them
to
determine
that
they
should
proceed
sanity.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
and
that's
just
what
they
did.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
not
in
my
opinion.
this
man
was
arrested,
indicted
and
held
under
open
charges
for
having
killed
five
people.
i
think
the
plea
of
insanity
is
up
to
him.
we
never
entered
a
plea
of
insanity
in
this
case
and
all
of
the
psychiatrists
had
at
the
hearing,
was
john's
confession
and
the
army
medical
records.
and
the
army
medical
records
were
november
and
december
of
1960,
january,
february,
march,
april
of
1961.
the
sanity
commission
hearings
were
not
held
until
1967
and
i
was
there
and
the
record
will
show
that
the
sanity
commission
hearing
consisted
of
all
the
police,
the
county
police,
detectives,
state
police,
two
police
departments
of
municipality,
saying
we
were
in
there
with
the
total
of
over
12
or
15
policemen
interrogating
john.
and
he
admitted
doing
these
things
and
he
gave
us
his
reason
for
doing
it,
that
his
father
told
him
that
these
people
had
put
evil
eye
on
them.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
except
with
the
test
for
the
man's
competency
to
stand
trial
in
pennsylvania
is
whether
or
not
he
understands
the
nature
of
the
proceedings
against
him,
and
does
he
have
the
ability
to
confer
with
counsel.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
i
don't
think
that
it
can
be
used
to
commit
him
to
an
institution
for
the
criminally
insane.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
the
act
i
believe
is
1951.
the
act
has
since
been
repealed.
i
initially
contended
that
the
district
attorney
was
not
a
person
under
that
act
entitled
to
initiate
the
proceedings.
the
trial
court
overruled
me.
the
state
supreme
court
said
that
the
issue
was
interlocutory
and
on
appeal,
if
your
honors
please,
this
case
was
argued
in
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
in
january
of
1968
before
an
opinion
came
down
justice
musmanno
died.
the
chief
justice,
chief
justice
bell
ordered
it
back
on
the
arguments
and
justice
pomeroy,
who
had
been
appointed
in
justice
musmanno's
place,
sat
with
the
court
and
the
decision
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
well,
i
wouldn't
profess
to
be
an
expert
on
it,
but
basically
in
a
civil
proceeding,
all
you
would,
up
until
recently,
all
you
needed
is
certification
of
two
doctors.
now,
in
pennsylvania,
there
must
be
a
hearing
in
front
of
a
common
police
judge
with
civil
commitment.
this
was
a
civil
procedure,
the
mental
health
act
and
they
had
sections
in
it
basically
which
said,
that
if
a
man
who's
in
custody
or
in
prison
or
serving
time
was
found
to
be
incompetent,
he
could
be
transferred
to
an
institution
for
the
criminally
insane.
there
were
no
cases
mr.
justice
blackmun
in
pennsylvania
where
this
had
ever
been
done
before.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
well,
basically
now,
it
would
be
the
same.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
no,
they
were
different.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
the
net
result,
would
be
--
probably
would
be
the
same
and
that's
why
i
presented
the
arguments
to
the
district
attorney's
and
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
bell
and
i
know
that
the
trial
judge,
judge
heinemann
said,
that
i
am
taken
advantage
of
this
fellow
whereas
i'm
not
because
the
realities
of
the
situation
are
is
that
all
they
have
the
confession,
they
have
a
gun
that
they
can't
use
and
if
we
went
to
trial,
based
on
over
20
years
of
experience,
i
don't
think
they
would
get
beyond
the
(inaudible),
but
if
they
did
get
beyond
the
(inaudible)
and
john
was
convicted,
what
would
he
get?
he
would
not
get
the
electric
chair
because
of
the
reality
of
the
situation
is
once
a
man
is
convicted,
i
put
him
on
the
stand
and
nobody
would
sentence
him
to
the
electric
chair,
so
the
most
he
would
get
would
be
life.
now,
he's
already
been
condemned
to
life
in
an
institution
for
the
criminally
insane
which
is
far
worse
than
farview,
they
can
call
it
a
hospital
but
it's
an
institution
for
the
criminally
insane.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
under
present
law,
if
he
was
--
yes
sir.
the
institution
could
transfer
him
and
there
wouldn't
be
a
thing
i
could
do
about
it,
but
at
least
he
would
have
his
trial.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
no,
i'm
not
sir.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
and
i
can't
answer
that
question
because
i'm
not
familiar
with
that.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes
sir
and
he'd
be
--
there's
a
procedure
and
he'd
be
committed
to
norristown
state
hospital.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes,
sir.
that's
--
you
see
that's
been
my
whole
issue
right
from
the
very
beginning
and
i
suppose,
i
will
be
simplifying
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
no.
no,
sir.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
if
he
was
tried
and
found
innocent,
they
would
have
to
commit
him
to
an
ordinary
state
hospital.
here
is
an
institution
for
the
criminally
insane,
as
the
only
people
who
go
there,
men
who
have
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
i
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
i
misunderstood
what
the
phrase
“stand
in
the
same
place”,
i
mean
he
would
be
confined.
now,
if
he
was
tried
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes,
sir.
but
one's
a
criminal
institution
and
the
other
is
just
a
state
hospital.
now
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
i
suppose
it's
possible
if
the
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
no,
mr.
justice
white
but
they
did
it
on
a
basis
of
an
illegal
confession
where
he
said
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
well,
and
his
army
medical
record.
he
didn't
answer
any
question
because
i
didn't
let
him.
he
drew
some
figures.
they
asked
him
some
draw
some
squares
and
some
blocks,
i
don't
know
what
that
was
supposed
to
prove.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
the
confession
where
he
says
he
killed
five
because
they
had
put
the
evil
eye
on
his
parents
and
the
army
medical
record,
which
said
that
he
was
schizophrenic.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
no,
sir
but
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
i
could
have,
but
my
evidence
would
have
necessitated
putting
john
bruno
on
the
stand.
now,
subsequent
to
the
adoption
of
the
sanity
commission's
report,
judge
heinemann
who
was
the
judge
who
appointed
the
commission
said
that
under
the
act,
i
had
a
right
to
a
hearing
and
i
didn't
ask
for
a
hearing
because
i
would
have
had
the
hearing
in
front
of
a
judge
and
i
would've
had
to
put
john
on
the
stand.
so,
i
simply
filed
exceptions
to
the
sanity
commission's
recommendation.
now,
he
had
two
psychiatrists,
the
judge
did
and
a
lawyer
who's
a
very
distinguished
senior
member
of
our
bar,
but
he
doesn't
practice
criminal
law
and
hasn't
for
at
least
15
years
and
that
lawyer
received
an
order,
this
is
on
the
record
from
the
judge,
“you
admit
john's
criminal
army
medical
records
by
order
of
the
court?”
and
that's
all
they
had
to
decide.
well,
the
army
said,
he's
schizo
and
john
says
he
killed
five
people,
he
must
have
criminal
tendencies
and
the
record
will
also
show
that
i
say
and
that
i
offered
to
(inaudible)
that
in
my
opinion
is
a
lawyer.
john
did
understand
the
nature
of
the
proceedings
against
him.
he
knows
very
well
that
he's
been
charged
with
killing
five
people
and
that
he
could
confer
with
counsel
and
this
is
one
we're
not
interested.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
i
have
him
examined
mr.
chief
justice
but
i
didn't
have
the
psychiatrist
testify.
i
had
him
examined
primarily
to
find
out
if
john
told
me
the
truth
and
i'm
still
not
sure
to
this
date
whether
john
killed
these
five
people
or
his
father
did.
his
father
did
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
mr.
chief
justice,
i
didn't
want
--
i
did
not
want
to
do
it.
i
didn't
think
i
had
to
do
it.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
i
know,
but
there
were
no
statutes
in
pennsylvania
that
required
that
i
do
it
that
way
and
i
felt
that
john
had
been
arrested
and
indicted
and
charged
with
five
murders
that
he
had
a
right
to
stand
trial.
now,
i
realize
the
state
supreme
court
narrowed
the
issues,
the
late
justice
collins
said,
this
case
raises
the
question
of
the
rights
being
incompetent.
who
decides
whether
he
stands
the
trial,
two
psychiatrists
or
his
lawyer?
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
sir?
well,
they
didn't
print
the
record.
they
sent
down
all
the
--
this
is
in
forma
pauperis.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
that's
correct.
now,
the
pennsylvania
cases
do
say
that
sanity
commission
proceedings
are
not
criminal
in
nature.
i
say,
they
are
in
this
case
because
they
committed
him
to
an
institution
for
the
criminally
insane.
they
sentenced
him.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
now,
the
fact
to
the
matter
is
when
they
asked
them
to
draw
pictures
and
squares
and
blocks,
i
let
him
do
it
and
they
showed
him
pictures
and
asked
him,
“what
this
means
to
you?”
and
i
let
them
do
that.
but
i
would
not
let
them
ask
many
questions
about
the
alleged
five
murders
which
obviously
they
wanted
him
to
do.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
right
now,
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes
sir.
they
would
be
done
by
the
psychiatrist
at
the
institution.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
and
i
might
add
that
i
have
never
denied
at
any
of
the
hearings
in
front
of
any
judges
or
justices
that
john
is
mentally
sick.
i've
never
denied
that.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
mr.
chief
justice,
that's
what
they
say
and
that's
what
they
ruled
and
i
disagree
with
them.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
i
think
his
competency
whether
or
not
he's
going
to
plead
insanity
is
up
first
over
him.
i
don't
see
how
in
the
one
hand
does
mr.
justice
roberts
said
in
his
dissenting
opinion
as
most
recently.
“how
can
the
commonwealth
arrest
somebody,
imprison
him,
this
man
has
been
confined
now
since
april
1966”
to
say
that
he
signed
this
confession
and
they
have
to
prosecute
him
and
in
the
next
hand
as
soon
they
realized
why
we
have
a
confession
that
we
can't
used,
we
have
a
gun
that
we
can't
use,
now
there
has
been
a
fact.
i
don't
see
how
they
can
be
both
and
that's
what
they've
done.
and
i
said
in
my
brief,
i
think
its
right
that
they
can
arrest
the
person
and
hold
him
for
25
or
26
hours
and
then
say,
he
signed
this
confession.
he
said
he
killed
five
people
and
to
do
it
for
the
reason
he
said
he
did
it,
he
must
be
crazy
and
especially
since
we
can't
prove
it
because
we
can't
use
this
confession,
we're
going
to
ship
him
off
to
far
place
and
that's
just
what
they
did.
the
record
will
show
that
i
fought
every
inch
of
the
way
simply
to
protect
the
record
and
about
the
only
round
i
won,
i
guess
so
far
is
when
this
honorable
court
granted
the
writ
of
certiorari.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes,
sir.
that's
my
proposition
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
that's
it.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
mr.
chief
justice,
i
reserved
the
ten
minutes
in
rebuttal
because
i'm
afraid
i'm
not
making
my
point
here.
i
say,
by
what
right
does
the
commonwealth
arrest
a
man
and
indict
him
and
then
say,
“no,
we're
not
going
to
put
him
to
trial
because
the
sanity
commission
says
he
has
criminal
tendencies
and
the
only
thing
in
the
record
before
the
sanity
commission
for
them
to
conclude
that
he
had
criminal
tendencies
was
the
illegal
confession.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes,
sir.
but
they
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
with
the
only
criminal
tendencies,
he
didn't
testify,
so
all
they
had
in
front
of
them
was
that
he
said
he
killed
five
people
for
these
crazy
reasons
and
they
had
no
right
to
conclude
that
he
could
not
confer
with
counsel
and
didn't
understand
the
nature
of
the
proceedings
because
i
was
there
and
as
his
lawyer,
i
said
he
does
understand
them
and
he
has
conferred
with
me
and
i'll
swear
to
it.
now
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
mr.
justice
black,
this
man
and
the
record
shows
this
was
taken
into
custody
with
his
father,
help
for
24
hours.
before
the
justice
of
the
peace
says,
his
rights
having
been
explained
to
him
three
times
and
this
is
in
the
record,
the
then
district
attorney
swore
under
oath
and
all
this
is
in
the
appendix
that
john
bruno's
rights
were
explained
to
him
and
he
understood
what
he
was
being
held
for,
he
swore
to
all
these
when
he
filed
the
answers
to
my
motions
to
suppress
answers
to
my
petitions
to
dismiss
the
sanity
commission.
he
said,
john
bruno's
rights,
constitutional
rights
have
not
been
offended
because
we
explained
everything
to
him
and
he
understood
it.
now,
they
can't
have
it
both
ways.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes,
that
would
be
--
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
i
offered
to
do
that.
that's
in
the
record.
i
offered
to
test
--
to
take
the
stand
on
the
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
no,
sir
and
as
i
say,
i'm
sort
of
a
volunteer
in
this
case,
but
the
case
--
and
i
think
the
transcript
of
the
docket
entries
will
show
it,
it
sort
of
deteriorated
into
whether
or
not
mr.
quinlan
was
going
to
force
a
trial
on
this
case
and
whether
the
district
attorney
was
going
to
able
to
sweep
under
the
rug
the
fact
that
he
had
announced
publicly
that
five
murders
had
been
solved
and
he
solved
them
with
this
staff,
but
now
i'm
not
going
to
put
him
on
trial.
now,
three
times
under
oath,
the
man
says,
the
district
attorney
says,
i
explained
all
his
rights
to
him.
now,
how
could
he
do
that?
this
confession
was
illegal
under
escobedo,
he
didn't
need
miranda
for
this.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
mr.
justice
thurgood
marshall,
they'll
never,
they'll
never
release
him.
well,
with
some
lawyers,
that's
filing
more
petition
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
no,
they
won't.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
this
of
course
asserted
by
him
for
trial.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
i
don't
get
any
information
from
this
state
institution
under
the
present
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
well,
i
don't
mean
that
but
they
don't
send
me
reports.
i've
never
seen
a
report
since
he
went
there.
he
went
there
in
june
of
1967.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
no,
i
didn't.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
i
said
i
did
not
try
to
get
one.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
now,
when
this
case
has
been
in
litigation
up
to
1969.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
if
i
get
the
relief
that
i've
asked
for,
yes.
they'd
have
to
put
him
on
trial
and
i'll
defend
him.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
if
it's
obvious
that
he's
insane?
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
well,
it's
not
going
to
--
it
wouldn't
happen
that
way.
they
bring
him
to
trial.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
well,
i
consulted
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
no,
mr.
justice
marshall
but
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
because
on
the
right
procedure
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
i
have
not
pleaded
the
defense
of
insanity.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
exactly.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
mr.
chief
justice,
there
was
a
very
solution
to
this
whole
case
which
i
proposed
under
our
rules
that
a
jury
could've
impaneled
and
the
commonwealth
could
have
put
their
psychiatrist
on
the
stand
and
without
any
other
testimony
the
trial
judge
could've
said
i
declare
this
man
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
and
this
fellow
would've
been
committed
to
an
army
hospital
in
coatesville,
pennsylvania
with
maximum
security.
before
i
sit
down,
i'd
like
to
suggest
by
analogy,
one
frightened
thing
that
could
happen
because
of
this
type
of
procedure.
there's
a
youngster
who
lives
in
my
community
who
is
now
20
or
21
and
he's
mentally
unbalanced.
he's
constantly
talking
about
girls
and
i
would
like
a
girl
and
this
and
that.
the
neighbors
complained.
he's
never
been
in
trouble.
when
and
if
there's
a
sex
crime
in
this
community,
he's
going
to
be
the
first
boy
the
police
pick
up.
he's
going
to
sign
anything
they
want
him
to
sign
which
is
just
what
happened
to
john
bruno
because
the
record
shows,
“once
you
signed
this
john,
we'll
take
care
of
you
and
taking
care
of
john
might
go
into
a
hospital.”
they
can
take
this
forward
to
the
court
house,
say
he
signed
a
confession
that
he
committed
all
these
terrible
crimes
and
if
he
did
it,
he's
obviously
mentally
incompetent
and
we
ship
him
off
to
farview
and
if
they
can
do
this
john
bruno,
i
respectfully
submit
they
can
do
it
to
anybody.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
not
if
they
first
directed
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
i
don't
want
this
hanging
over
his
head
for
the
rest
of
his
life.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
well
either
that
or
put
him
on
trial.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
i
would
object
it
because
they
would
have
him
civilly
committed
to
an
ordinary
mental
hospital
and
through
their
inter
hospital
procedures,
they
would
transfer
him
to
back
--
transfer
him
back
to
farview.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
well,
i
guess,
he's
filed
more
petitions
for
writs
of
habeas
corpus,
the
way
i've
been
doing
it
so
far,
though
i
haven't
been
too
successful.
i
just
think
it's
terrible
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes
sir,
except
for
this
though.
the
common
law
as
outlined
in
the
decision
of
law
and
this
is
all
in
all
the
dissenting
opinions
of
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court,
that's
why
i
didn't
cite
any
cases
in
my
brief,
if
your
honors
notice,
i
rely
on
the
constitution
and
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
reviewed
all
the
cases
on
this
subject.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
it's
been
my
role
in
this
whole
case
and
we've
lost
over
time
that
--
as
i
say,
if
they
can
do
this
john
bruno,
they
can
do
it
me
on
my
home
when
i
cross
the
county.
they
can
pick
me
up,
hold
me
for
24
hours,
come
on
television
the
next
day,
announce
to
the
press,
quinlan
admitted
that
he
committed
certain
sex
crimes
and
he
did
it
because
he
hates
his
mother.
and
anybody
who
will
do
that
because
he
hates
his
mother
is
crazy
and
knowing
that
they
can't
prove
it,
they
ship
me
off
to
farview.
maybe
this
has
happened
a
lot
of
times.
i
don't
know,
i
just
sort
of
stumbled
into
this
case.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
they
say
that
in
the
confession,
he
said,
“do
i
know
it?”
his
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes,
sir.
i
do
know
it.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
well,
i
don't
think
you're
going
to
have
five
indictments
because
i
know
bruno,
i
know
his
father,
and
his
--
his
father
believes
the
same
thing.
i
don't
know
who
killed
these
five
people
and
i
don't
think
the
district
attorney
knows
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
should
be
committed?
yes
and
i
made
arrangements
through
the
department
of
the
army
to
have
him
committed
to
coatesville
maximum
security
building.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
because
the
army
will
not
so
commit
him
as
long
as
there's
a
pending
criminal
charge
against
him.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
well,
would
you
put
him
out
on
the
street,
no.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
no
it's
not
all
that
it's
about.
all
that
it's
about
is
when
they
denied
him
the
right
to
a
trial.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
one
of
them.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
well,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
i
could
have
him
transferred
to
the
army.
i've
let
him
say
so.
they'd
put
him
on
a
veterans
hospital
with
maximum
security
and
some
psychiatric
caboose
but
he's
not
going
to
get
in
farview.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
this
thing
has
been
going
on
for
five
years
now.
i
think
that
they
--
they
now
passed
the
indictments
to
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
i
would
prevail
and
have
him
confined
to
a
veterans'
hospital.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
no,
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
they
just
can't
prove
it
and
i'm
not
sure
in
my
own
mind
whether
john
killed
these
five
people
or
his
father
did.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
how
are
they
going
to
prove
he's
insane,
i
wouldn't
put
him
on
a
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
the
realities
of
it
is,
what
really
annoys
the
commonwealth.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
well,
really
the
practical
problem
here
is
that
john
bruno
and
his
lawyer
quinlan
win
no
matter
what
happens
because
if
they
convict
him
in
front
of
a
jury.
i
then
put
him
stand
or
with
or
put
him
on
a
psychiatrist
and
nobody
is
going
to
send
him
to
the
electric
chair
and
he's
going
to
get
life
which
is
what
he
has
got,
without
a
trial.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
i
did
that
mr.
justice
black.
i
tried
to
the
former
district
attorney
and
the
judge
to
bring
him
to
trial
empanel
of
jury
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
well,
either
that
or
now
press
the
indictment
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
they
won't
though.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes,
sir.
i
have
correspondence
saying,
we
would
take
him
on
the
open
criminal
charges.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
he
flatly
said
no.
not
this
district
attorney,
there
is
predecessor.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
john
harry
bruno
was
born
and
raised
in
the
borough
of
norristown
which
is
about
20
miles
west
of
philadelphia
and
the
records
in
this
case
show
that
he
attended
public
school.
it
was
elicited
to
the
various
hearings,
habeas
corpus
hearings,
suppression
hearings,
insanity
hearings
that
he
had
never
been
in
trouble.
low
and
behold,
he
was
drafted
by
the
united
states
army
in
november
of
1961
and
at
some
point
during
his
basic
training,
abbreviated
as
it
was,
it
was
determined
that
john
was
unlike
the
other
draftees
that
he
was
sick
and
he
was
transferred
to
fitzsimons
general
hospital
in
denver,
colorado
where
he
was
in
a
psychiatric
ward.
he
was
discharged
by
the
united
states
army
in
may
of
1961
and
sent
home
by
himself.
now
prior
to
that,
a
murder
had
taken
place
in
october
of
1961
in
norristown,
montgomery
county,
pennsylvania,
husband
and
wife
were
killed.
subsequent
to
john's
discharge
from
the
army,
he
held
jobs
in
norristown.
he
was
not
in
any
trouble
that
anybody
knows
of,
although
the
records
does
show
that
subsequent
to
december
of
1963
when
two
other
people
were
murdered,
john
was
interrogated
by
the
county
detectives
and/or
the
district
attorney's
office
and
now
it's
1964
and
given
a
lie
detector
test.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
well,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes,
sir.
from
the
very
beginning,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
entered
my
appearance
within
a
week
or
10
days
the
district
attorney
--
the
district
attorney
petitioned
for
a
sanity
commission,
alleging
that
john
was
insane
and
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
no
sir.
all
they
had
--
all
they
had
to
base
their
petition
on
was
the
confession
that
they
elicited
from
john
bruno
when
they
held
him
for
26
hours
without
a
lawyer.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
no
sir,
they
did
not.
they
subpoenaed
his
medical
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
at
that
point
they
didn't
know
it.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
i
believe
it
does,
mr.
chief
justice,
yes.
the
records
of
his
medical
records
were
not
brought
into
the
picture
until
the
sanity
commission
actually
sat
in
1967
and
they
subpoenaed
them
by
the
order
--
the
record
also
show
that
one
judge
tranquility
signed
all
of
the
orders
in
this
case.
now,
i
resisted
the
appointment
of
the
sanity
commission,
at
the
same
time
i
filed
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
hearing
to
find
out
what
they
did
have
against
john
bruno.
as
mr.
justice
roberts
said,
at
that
first
appeal
in
the
state
supreme
court,
“how
in
the
world
can
they
can
take
an
illegal
confession
and
hold
it
here,
and
say,
if
john
bruno
did
these
terrible
things
for
the
reasons
that
he
gave
for
doing
them,
then
he
must
be
crazy.”
now,
if
the
confession
is
inadmissible
in
a
courtroom,
it
should
not
have
been
used
for
them
to
determine
that
they
should
proceed
sanity.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
and
that's
just
what
they
did.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
not
in
my
opinion.
this
man
was
arrested,
indicted
and
held
under
open
charges
for
having
killed
five
people.
i
think
the
plea
of
insanity
is
up
to
him.
we
never
entered
a
plea
of
insanity
in
this
case
and
all
of
the
psychiatrists
had
at
the
hearing,
was
john's
confession
and
the
army
medical
records.
and
the
army
medical
records
were
november
and
december
of
1960,
january,
february,
march,
april
of
1961.
the
sanity
commission
hearings
were
not
held
until
1967
and
i
was
there
and
the
record
will
show
that
the
sanity
commission
hearing
consisted
of
all
the
police,
the
county
police,
detectives,
state
police,
two
police
departments
of
municipality,
saying
we
were
in
there
with
the
total
of
over
12
or
15
policemen
interrogating
john.
and
he
admitted
doing
these
things
and
he
gave
us
his
reason
for
doing
it,
that
his
father
told
him
that
these
people
had
put
evil
eye
on
them.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
except
with
the
test
for
the
man's
competency
to
stand
trial
in
pennsylvania
is
whether
or
not
he
understands
the
nature
of
the
proceedings
against
him,
and
does
he
have
the
ability
to
confer
with
counsel.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
i
don't
think
that
it
can
be
used
to
commit
him
to
an
institution
for
the
criminally
insane.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
the
act
i
believe
is
1951.
the
act
has
since
been
repealed.
i
initially
contended
that
the
district
attorney
was
not
a
person
under
that
act
entitled
to
initiate
the
proceedings.
the
trial
court
overruled
me.
the
state
supreme
court
said
that
the
issue
was
interlocutory
and
on
appeal,
if
your
honors
please,
this
case
was
argued
in
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
in
january
of
1968
before
an
opinion
came
down
justice
musmanno
died.
the
chief
justice,
chief
justice
bell
ordered
it
back
on
the
arguments
and
justice
pomeroy,
who
had
been
appointed
in
justice
musmanno's
place,
sat
with
the
court
and
the
decision
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
well,
i
wouldn't
profess
to
be
an
expert
on
it,
but
basically
in
a
civil
proceeding,
all
you
would,
up
until
recently,
all
you
needed
is
certification
of
two
doctors.
now,
in
pennsylvania,
there
must
be
a
hearing
in
front
of
a
common
police
judge
with
civil
commitment.
this
was
a
civil
procedure,
the
mental
health
act
and
they
had
sections
in
it
basically
which
said,
that
if
a
man
who's
in
custody
or
in
prison
or
serving
time
was
found
to
be
incompetent,
he
could
be
transferred
to
an
institution
for
the
criminally
insane.
there
were
no
cases
mr.
justice
blackmun
in
pennsylvania
where
this
had
ever
been
done
before.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
well,
basically
now,
it
would
be
the
same.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
no,
they
were
different.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
the
net
result,
would
be
--
probably
would
be
the
same
and
that's
why
i
presented
the
arguments
to
the
district
attorney's
and
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
bell
and
i
know
that
the
trial
judge,
judge
heinemann
said,
that
i
am
taken
advantage
of
this
fellow
whereas
i'm
not
because
the
realities
of
the
situation
are
is
that
all
they
have
the
confession,
they
have
a
gun
that
they
can't
use
and
if
we
went
to
trial,
based
on
over
20
years
of
experience,
i
don't
think
they
would
get
beyond
the
(inaudible),
but
if
they
did
get
beyond
the
(inaudible)
and
john
was
convicted,
what
would
he
get?
he
would
not
get
the
electric
chair
because
of
the
reality
of
the
situation
is
once
a
man
is
convicted,
i
put
him
on
the
stand
and
nobody
would
sentence
him
to
the
electric
chair,
so
the
most
he
would
get
would
be
life.
now,
he's
already
been
condemned
to
life
in
an
institution
for
the
criminally
insane
which
is
far
worse
than
farview,
they
can
call
it
a
hospital
but
it's
an
institution
for
the
criminally
insane.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
under
present
law,
if
he
was
--
yes
sir.
the
institution
could
transfer
him
and
there
wouldn't
be
a
thing
i
could
do
about
it,
but
at
least
he
would
have
his
trial.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
no,
i'm
not
sir.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
and
i
can't
answer
that
question
because
i'm
not
familiar
with
that.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes
sir
and
he'd
be
--
there's
a
procedure
and
he'd
be
committed
to
norristown
state
hospital.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes,
sir.
that's
--
you
see
that's
been
my
whole
issue
right
from
the
very
beginning
and
i
suppose,
i
will
be
simplifying
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
no.
no,
sir.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
if
he
was
tried
and
found
innocent,
they
would
have
to
commit
him
to
an
ordinary
state
hospital.
here
is
an
institution
for
the
criminally
insane,
as
the
only
people
who
go
there,
men
who
have
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
i
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
i
misunderstood
what
the
phrase
“stand
in
the
same
place”,
i
mean
he
would
be
confined.
now,
if
he
was
tried
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes,
sir.
but
one's
a
criminal
institution
and
the
other
is
just
a
state
hospital.
now
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
i
suppose
it's
possible
if
the
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
no,
mr.
justice
white
but
they
did
it
on
a
basis
of
an
illegal
confession
where
he
said
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
well,
and
his
army
medical
record.
he
didn't
answer
any
question
because
i
didn't
let
him.
he
drew
some
figures.
they
asked
him
some
draw
some
squares
and
some
blocks,
i
don't
know
what
that
was
supposed
to
prove.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
the
confession
where
he
says
he
killed
five
because
they
had
put
the
evil
eye
on
his
parents
and
the
army
medical
record,
which
said
that
he
was
schizophrenic.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
no,
sir
but
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
i
could
have,
but
my
evidence
would
have
necessitated
putting
john
bruno
on
the
stand.
now,
subsequent
to
the
adoption
of
the
sanity
commission's
report,
judge
heinemann
who
was
the
judge
who
appointed
the
commission
said
that
under
the
act,
i
had
a
right
to
a
hearing
and
i
didn't
ask
for
a
hearing
because
i
would
have
had
the
hearing
in
front
of
a
judge
and
i
would've
had
to
put
john
on
the
stand.
so,
i
simply
filed
exceptions
to
the
sanity
commission's
recommendation.
now,
he
had
two
psychiatrists,
the
judge
did
and
a
lawyer
who's
a
very
distinguished
senior
member
of
our
bar,
but
he
doesn't
practice
criminal
law
and
hasn't
for
at
least
15
years
and
that
lawyer
received
an
order,
this
is
on
the
record
from
the
judge,
“you
admit
john's
criminal
army
medical
records
by
order
of
the
court?”
and
that's
all
they
had
to
decide.
well,
the
army
said,
he's
schizo
and
john
says
he
killed
five
people,
he
must
have
criminal
tendencies
and
the
record
will
also
show
that
i
say
and
that
i
offered
to
(inaudible)
that
in
my
opinion
is
a
lawyer.
john
did
understand
the
nature
of
the
proceedings
against
him.
he
knows
very
well
that
he's
been
charged
with
killing
five
people
and
that
he
could
confer
with
counsel
and
this
is
one
we're
not
interested.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
i
have
him
examined
mr.
chief
justice
but
i
didn't
have
the
psychiatrist
testify.
i
had
him
examined
primarily
to
find
out
if
john
told
me
the
truth
and
i'm
still
not
sure
to
this
date
whether
john
killed
these
five
people
or
his
father
did.
his
father
did
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
mr.
chief
justice,
i
didn't
want
--
i
did
not
want
to
do
it.
i
didn't
think
i
had
to
do
it.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
i
know,
but
there
were
no
statutes
in
pennsylvania
that
required
that
i
do
it
that
way
and
i
felt
that
john
had
been
arrested
and
indicted
and
charged
with
five
murders
that
he
had
a
right
to
stand
trial.
now,
i
realize
the
state
supreme
court
narrowed
the
issues,
the
late
justice
collins
said,
this
case
raises
the
question
of
the
rights
being
incompetent.
who
decides
whether
he
stands
the
trial,
two
psychiatrists
or
his
lawyer?
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
sir?
well,
they
didn't
print
the
record.
they
sent
down
all
the
--
this
is
in
forma
pauperis.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
that's
correct.
now,
the
pennsylvania
cases
do
say
that
sanity
commission
proceedings
are
not
criminal
in
nature.
i
say,
they
are
in
this
case
because
they
committed
him
to
an
institution
for
the
criminally
insane.
they
sentenced
him.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
now,
the
fact
to
the
matter
is
when
they
asked
them
to
draw
pictures
and
squares
and
blocks,
i
let
him
do
it
and
they
showed
him
pictures
and
asked
him,
“what
this
means
to
you?”
and
i
let
them
do
that.
but
i
would
not
let
them
ask
many
questions
about
the
alleged
five
murders
which
obviously
they
wanted
him
to
do.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
right
now,
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes
sir.
they
would
be
done
by
the
psychiatrist
at
the
institution.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
and
i
might
add
that
i
have
never
denied
at
any
of
the
hearings
in
front
of
any
judges
or
justices
that
john
is
mentally
sick.
i've
never
denied
that.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
mr.
chief
justice,
that's
what
they
say
and
that's
what
they
ruled
and
i
disagree
with
them.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
i
think
his
competency
whether
or
not
he's
going
to
plead
insanity
is
up
first
over
him.
i
don't
see
how
in
the
one
hand
does
mr.
justice
roberts
said
in
his
dissenting
opinion
as
most
recently.
“how
can
the
commonwealth
arrest
somebody,
imprison
him,
this
man
has
been
confined
now
since
april
1966”
to
say
that
he
signed
this
confession
and
they
have
to
prosecute
him
and
in
the
next
hand
as
soon
they
realized
why
we
have
a
confession
that
we
can't
used,
we
have
a
gun
that
we
can't
use,
now
there
has
been
a
fact.
i
don't
see
how
they
can
be
both
and
that's
what
they've
done.
and
i
said
in
my
brief,
i
think
its
right
that
they
can
arrest
the
person
and
hold
him
for
25
or
26
hours
and
then
say,
he
signed
this
confession.
he
said
he
killed
five
people
and
to
do
it
for
the
reason
he
said
he
did
it,
he
must
be
crazy
and
especially
since
we
can't
prove
it
because
we
can't
use
this
confession,
we're
going
to
ship
him
off
to
far
place
and
that's
just
what
they
did.
the
record
will
show
that
i
fought
every
inch
of
the
way
simply
to
protect
the
record
and
about
the
only
round
i
won,
i
guess
so
far
is
when
this
honorable
court
granted
the
writ
of
certiorari.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes,
sir.
that's
my
proposition
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
that's
it.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
mr.
chief
justice,
i
reserved
the
ten
minutes
in
rebuttal
because
i'm
afraid
i'm
not
making
my
point
here.
i
say,
by
what
right
does
the
commonwealth
arrest
a
man
and
indict
him
and
then
say,
“no,
we're
not
going
to
put
him
to
trial
because
the
sanity
commission
says
he
has
criminal
tendencies
and
the
only
thing
in
the
record
before
the
sanity
commission
for
them
to
conclude
that
he
had
criminal
tendencies
was
the
illegal
confession.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes,
sir.
but
they
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
with
the
only
criminal
tendencies,
he
didn't
testify,
so
all
they
had
in
front
of
them
was
that
he
said
he
killed
five
people
for
these
crazy
reasons
and
they
had
no
right
to
conclude
that
he
could
not
confer
with
counsel
and
didn't
understand
the
nature
of
the
proceedings
because
i
was
there
and
as
his
lawyer,
i
said
he
does
understand
them
and
he
has
conferred
with
me
and
i'll
swear
to
it.
now
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
mr.
justice
black,
this
man
and
the
record
shows
this
was
taken
into
custody
with
his
father,
help
for
24
hours.
before
the
justice
of
the
peace
says,
his
rights
having
been
explained
to
him
three
times
and
this
is
in
the
record,
the
then
district
attorney
swore
under
oath
and
all
this
is
in
the
appendix
that
john
bruno's
rights
were
explained
to
him
and
he
understood
what
he
was
being
held
for,
he
swore
to
all
these
when
he
filed
the
answers
to
my
motions
to
suppress
answers
to
my
petitions
to
dismiss
the
sanity
commission.
he
said,
john
bruno's
rights,
constitutional
rights
have
not
been
offended
because
we
explained
everything
to
him
and
he
understood
it.
now,
they
can't
have
it
both
ways.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes,
that
would
be
--
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
i
offered
to
do
that.
that's
in
the
record.
i
offered
to
test
--
to
take
the
stand
on
the
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
no,
sir
and
as
i
say,
i'm
sort
of
a
volunteer
in
this
case,
but
the
case
--
and
i
think
the
transcript
of
the
docket
entries
will
show
it,
it
sort
of
deteriorated
into
whether
or
not
mr.
quinlan
was
going
to
force
a
trial
on
this
case
and
whether
the
district
attorney
was
going
to
able
to
sweep
under
the
rug
the
fact
that
he
had
announced
publicly
that
five
murders
had
been
solved
and
he
solved
them
with
this
staff,
but
now
i'm
not
going
to
put
him
on
trial.
now,
three
times
under
oath,
the
man
says,
the
district
attorney
says,
i
explained
all
his
rights
to
him.
now,
how
could
he
do
that?
this
confession
was
illegal
under
escobedo,
he
didn't
need
miranda
for
this.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
mr.
justice
thurgood
marshall,
they'll
never,
they'll
never
release
him.
well,
with
some
lawyers,
that's
filing
more
petition
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
no,
they
won't.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
this
of
course
asserted
by
him
for
trial.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
i
don't
get
any
information
from
this
state
institution
under
the
present
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
well,
i
don't
mean
that
but
they
don't
send
me
reports.
i've
never
seen
a
report
since
he
went
there.
he
went
there
in
june
of
1967.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
no,
i
didn't.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
i
said
i
did
not
try
to
get
one.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
now,
when
this
case
has
been
in
litigation
up
to
1969.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
if
i
get
the
relief
that
i've
asked
for,
yes.
they'd
have
to
put
him
on
trial
and
i'll
defend
him.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
if
it's
obvious
that
he's
insane?
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
well,
it's
not
going
to
--
it
wouldn't
happen
that
way.
they
bring
him
to
trial.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
well,
i
consulted
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
no,
mr.
justice
marshall
but
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
because
on
the
right
procedure
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
i
have
not
pleaded
the
defense
of
insanity.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
exactly.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
mr.
chief
justice,
there
was
a
very
solution
to
this
whole
case
which
i
proposed
under
our
rules
that
a
jury
could've
impaneled
and
the
commonwealth
could
have
put
their
psychiatrist
on
the
stand
and
without
any
other
testimony
the
trial
judge
could've
said
i
declare
this
man
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
and
this
fellow
would've
been
committed
to
an
army
hospital
in
coatesville,
pennsylvania
with
maximum
security.
before
i
sit
down,
i'd
like
to
suggest
by
analogy,
one
frightened
thing
that
could
happen
because
of
this
type
of
procedure.
there's
a
youngster
who
lives
in
my
community
who
is
now
20
or
21
and
he's
mentally
unbalanced.
he's
constantly
talking
about
girls
and
i
would
like
a
girl
and
this
and
that.
the
neighbors
complained.
he's
never
been
in
trouble.
when
and
if
there's
a
sex
crime
in
this
community,
he's
going
to
be
the
first
boy
the
police
pick
up.
he's
going
to
sign
anything
they
want
him
to
sign
which
is
just
what
happened
to
john
bruno
because
the
record
shows,
“once
you
signed
this
john,
we'll
take
care
of
you
and
taking
care
of
john
might
go
into
a
hospital.”
they
can
take
this
forward
to
the
court
house,
say
he
signed
a
confession
that
he
committed
all
these
terrible
crimes
and
if
he
did
it,
he's
obviously
mentally
incompetent
and
we
ship
him
off
to
farview
and
if
they
can
do
this
john
bruno,
i
respectfully
submit
they
can
do
it
to
anybody.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
not
if
they
first
directed
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
i
don't
want
this
hanging
over
his
head
for
the
rest
of
his
life.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
well
either
that
or
put
him
on
trial.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
i
would
object
it
because
they
would
have
him
civilly
committed
to
an
ordinary
mental
hospital
and
through
their
inter
hospital
procedures,
they
would
transfer
him
to
back
--
transfer
him
back
to
farview.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
well,
i
guess,
he's
filed
more
petitions
for
writs
of
habeas
corpus,
the
way
i've
been
doing
it
so
far,
though
i
haven't
been
too
successful.
i
just
think
it's
terrible
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes
sir,
except
for
this
though.
the
common
law
as
outlined
in
the
decision
of
law
and
this
is
all
in
all
the
dissenting
opinions
of
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court,
that's
why
i
didn't
cite
any
cases
in
my
brief,
if
your
honors
notice,
i
rely
on
the
constitution
and
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
reviewed
all
the
cases
on
this
subject.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
it's
been
my
role
in
this
whole
case
and
we've
lost
over
time
that
--
as
i
say,
if
they
can
do
this
john
bruno,
they
can
do
it
me
on
my
home
when
i
cross
the
county.
they
can
pick
me
up,
hold
me
for
24
hours,
come
on
television
the
next
day,
announce
to
the
press,
quinlan
admitted
that
he
committed
certain
sex
crimes
and
he
did
it
because
he
hates
his
mother.
and
anybody
who
will
do
that
because
he
hates
his
mother
is
crazy
and
knowing
that
they
can't
prove
it,
they
ship
me
off
to
farview.
maybe
this
has
happened
a
lot
of
times.
i
don't
know,
i
just
sort
of
stumbled
into
this
case.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
they
say
that
in
the
confession,
he
said,
“do
i
know
it?”
his
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes,
sir.
i
do
know
it.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
well,
i
don't
think
you're
going
to
have
five
indictments
because
i
know
bruno,
i
know
his
father,
and
his
--
his
father
believes
the
same
thing.
i
don't
know
who
killed
these
five
people
and
i
don't
think
the
district
attorney
knows
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
should
be
committed?
yes
and
i
made
arrangements
through
the
department
of
the
army
to
have
him
committed
to
coatesville
maximum
security
building.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
because
the
army
will
not
so
commit
him
as
long
as
there's
a
pending
criminal
charge
against
him.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
well,
would
you
put
him
out
on
the
street,
no.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
no
it's
not
all
that
it's
about.
all
that
it's
about
is
when
they
denied
him
the
right
to
a
trial.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
one
of
them.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
well,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
i
could
have
him
transferred
to
the
army.
i've
let
him
say
so.
they'd
put
him
on
a
veterans
hospital
with
maximum
security
and
some
psychiatric
caboose
but
he's
not
going
to
get
in
farview.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
this
thing
has
been
going
on
for
five
years
now.
i
think
that
they
--
they
now
passed
the
indictments
to
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
i
would
prevail
and
have
him
confined
to
a
veterans'
hospital.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
no,
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
they
just
can't
prove
it
and
i'm
not
sure
in
my
own
mind
whether
john
killed
these
five
people
or
his
father
did.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
how
are
they
going
to
prove
he's
insane,
i
wouldn't
put
him
on
a
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
the
realities
of
it
is,
what
really
annoys
the
commonwealth.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
well,
really
the
practical
problem
here
is
that
john
bruno
and
his
lawyer
quinlan
win
no
matter
what
happens
because
if
they
convict
him
in
front
of
a
jury.
i
then
put
him
stand
or
with
or
put
him
on
a
psychiatrist
and
nobody
is
going
to
send
him
to
the
electric
chair
and
he's
going
to
get
life
which
is
what
he
has
got,
without
a
trial.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
i
did
that
mr.
justice
black.
i
tried
to
the
former
district
attorney
and
the
judge
to
bring
him
to
trial
empanel
of
jury
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
well,
either
that
or
now
press
the
indictment
--
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
they
won't
though.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
yes,
sir.
i
have
correspondence
saying,
we
would
take
him
on
the
open
criminal
charges.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
he
flatly
said
no.
not
this
district
attorney,
there
is
predecessor.
mr.
daniel
l.
quinlan
thank
you,
sir.
