the
start
of
the
planning,
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
by
1970?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
haven’t
yet
on
the
1970
figure?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
you
did
then
will
you
go
to
the
court
and
say
look
into
the
plan
and
not
wait
for
the
1970
figure,
give
us
a
hearing
and
we’re
going
to
implement
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
what
really
the
issue
you
were
telling
was
that
the
courts
waited
long
enough
for
the
legislature
to
act.
they
didn’t
do
it
and
the
court
didn’t
act.
do
you
want
now
to
tell
the
court,
you
fashion
the
plan
out
and
make
it
effective,
that’s
what
you
want?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
do
you
elect
your
legislature?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
numbered
years,
so
your
next
election
is
1972?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
your
theory
is
that
there
should
be
a
plan
which
could
be
applicable
to
1972
legislative
elections?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
waiting
until
november
for
the
court
to
do
something
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
the
legislature
is
not
principally
doing
anything.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
arizona’s
position
of
this
situation
of
having
no
apportionment,
no
constitutional
apportionment
by
the
law.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn’t
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
get
anymore
optimistic
prediction
or
one
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
there
is
some
suggestion
that
may
in
fact
be
available
by
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
june.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
the
legislature
now,
will
it
be
a
continuous
session
between
now
and
november?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
by
over
you
mean
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
would
have
to
be
--
it
would
it
be
a
special
session?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
can
it
be
unless
the
government
calls
for
a
special
session?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
any
reason
as
per
the
information,
why
do
you
have
to
base
the
reapportionment
plan
on
figures
by
census
tracks,
there
are
a
lot
of
figures
available
by
counties?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
i
understand
that
one
of
the
opinions
you
can
no
longer
start
with
a
reappointment
plan
on
the
basis
of
registered
voters,
you
have
to
do
on
population?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
can’t
do
it
on
population
by
larger
areas
than
such
as
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
but
(inaudible),
if
you
were
to
go
today
and
ask
one
and
i
said,
go
ahead,
read
the
books,
take
them
off,
and
they
certify
those
officially
on
1970
figures?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
basis
some
officially
certified,
take
the
population
figures.
isn’t
that
the
basis
of
reapportionment
plan?
justice
william
j.
