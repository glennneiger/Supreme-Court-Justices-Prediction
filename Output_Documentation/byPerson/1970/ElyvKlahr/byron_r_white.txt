justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
the
part
of
legislature
in
the
reapportionment.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
is
still
left
aside
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
bring
them
to
the
district
court
and
we
know
that
on
the
issue
of
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
do
i
understand
it
on
voter
registration
that
you
made
accommodation,
made
it
in
view
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
on
the
other
subsequent
issue,
you
agree
with
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
only
thing
is
that
you
would
rather
have
something
else
happened
for
purposes
of
the
election
that
is
now
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
with
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
the
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
state
didn’t
prosecute
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
if
it
is
apparently
satisfied
with
the
way
the
district
court
decided
things
on
the
substantive
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
the
legislature
follows
that
decision
as
about
to
a
court
based
on
legislation
--
justice
byron
r.
white
here
you
have
an
outstanding
judgment
that
says
--
that
the
opinion
says
that
the
(inaudible)
on
accurate
basis
for
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
the
--
they
do
attack
that
plan
but
right
now
there’s
no
issue
between
you
and
the
state
on
voters
registration
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
no
issue
on
any
of
the
substantive
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
shea,
if
the
court
adopted
a
plan
now
based
on
the
1970
census
figures,
the
court
heard
you
and
the
court
adopted
your
plan
and
put
it
into
effect
and
then
the
legislature
had
a
special
session
and
adopted
its
own
plan.
now
i
suppose
it
would
supersede
the
district
court’s
plan?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
if
you
really
gain?
you
wouldn’t
think
the
legislature
would
just
not
attempt
its
own
plan
that
the
court
made
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
there,
there
maybe
also
sorts
of
choices
to
be
made
about
how
to
construct
constitutional
plans?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
all
did
that
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
mcgowan,
following
the
census
figures
peculiar
for
arizona
or
is
it
nationwide?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
you
have
the
figures
for
each
county?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
population
of
each
county?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
have
single
member
districts
in
the
rest
of
the
counties,
i
think?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
a
multi-member
district
right
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
do
need
the
single-member
districts,
even
if
you
have
county
wide
multi-member
districts
you
would
still
need
it
for
the
house
–
single-member
districts?

you
