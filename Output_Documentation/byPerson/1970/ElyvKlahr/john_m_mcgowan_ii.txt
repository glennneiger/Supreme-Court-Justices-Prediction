mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
briefly
review
for
the
court
some
of
the
history
of
this
case.
as
mr.
shea
properly
stated,
it
was
filed
in
april
1964
at
--
no
action
was
taken
in
the
legislature
because
at
that
time
this
legislature
was
in
adjournment.
it
said
we’ll
not
meet
again
until
1965
and
at
that
time,
it
made
some
passing
attempts
at
legislation.
then,
in
a
special
session,in
october
1965,
it
passed
that
--
one
house
passed
a
bill,
the
senate
passed
a
bill.
that
was
then
before
the
court
in
the
hearings
we
had
in
november
of
1965,
and
lest
there
be
a
feeling
that
the
present
majority
was
the
majority
then,
the
senate
was
elected
in
1964,
had
two
republicans
and
26
democrats,
had
35
republicans
and
45
democrats
in
the
house.
that
was
under
the
old
senate
before
reapportionment.
in
1965
we
had
a
three-day
hearing
before
then
circuit
judge
pope,
the
judge
welsh
and
i
can’t
recall
other
justices
–judge
was
there.
then
in
february
1966,
the
decree
was
issued
and
the
parties
were
told
to
agree
on
the
two
populous
counties
for
the
division
of
maricopa
and
pima
county,
an
agreement
was
is
in
effect
reached
and
the
court
changed
a
few
precincts
and
the
agreement
was
reached
between
the
major
in
effect
the
parties,
i
mean
the
political
parties.
at
that
time,
the
plaintiff
intervener
was
not
in
the
action,
it
was
between
mr.
klahr
and
the
governor,
that
time
there
was
a
democratic
governor
and
the
legislature.
the
hearing,
the
decree
was
established
the
fact
that
we
had
30
districts
in
the
states
and
each
senatorial
district
had
two
house
members.
the
counties
were
kept
together
as
units
except
in
the
two
major
counties
and
there
they
were
subdivided
by
a
formula
that
the
court
approved.
that
the
court
in
effect
suggested
and
that
was
bringing
the
1960
census
figures
up
to
date
by
ratio
of
the
voter
registration
in
the
county
to
the
precinct
involved
because
in
arizona,
the
rapid
growth
patterns,
if
we
use
census
tracks
which
if
you've
ever
read
the
census
tracks,
they
say
up
to
a
telephone
poll
in
effect
over
a
creek
and
down
to
an
old
minings
--there’s
no
legal
descriptions
in
the
sense
that
we
use
in
any
other
legal
works
and
avoiding
the
census
tracks.
so
we
used
precincts
in
the
1966
division.
in
the
election
of
1966
in
the
senate,
there
were
16
republicans
elected
and
14
democrats,
33
republicans
in
the
house
and
27
democrats.
for
the
first
time
in
history,
republican
party
had
a
majority
in
ether
house
or
both
houses.
so
i
say
that
to
you
for
this
one
reason
that
the
present
leadership
of
the
house
in
senate
are
the
beneficiaries
of
reapportionment.
if
it
was
not
for
reapportionment,
they
would
still
be
in
the
minority,
and
not
only
do
they
act
in
good
faith
in
an
attempt
to
reapportion,
it
is
to
their
own
enlightened
self-interest
because
they
would
not
be
there
without
reapportionment.
in
1967,
there
was
a
special
session
in
which
another
attempt
was
made
to
have
a
legislated
enacted
reapportionment
to
replace
the
court
decree.
that
special
session
was
in
the
spring
of
--
in
may
of
1967.
at
that
time,
the
matter
was
referred
to
the
people
and
our
constitution
says
that
5%
of
the
voters
may
refer
to
the
people
any
bill.
no
bill
becomes
a
law
for
90
days.
so
prior
to
its
effective
date,
this
was
referred
to
the
people
by
5%
of
the
electorate
which
meant
it
went
to
the
ballot
in
1968.
the
people
approved
it
in
1968,
and
we
had
a
hearing
in
january
of
1969
in
which
the
court
struck
down
house
bill
1
it
was
called,
because
it
did
not
follow
--
it
did
use
registration
figures
only
because
in
the
meantime,
the
kirkpatrick
and
the
rockefeller
case
had
come
down.
at
the
time
of
the
first
decree
in
1966,
the
court
was
laboring
under
the
thought
as
mr.
frank
reminded
them
in
our
hearing
last
spring
of
a
so-called
seller
amendment
which
was
then
pending
in
the
congress
that
we
could
have
a
15%
variation
in
figures.
that
as
--
following
this
court’s
decision
in
kirkpatrick
no
longer
of
course
is
the
case.
in
the
hearing
we
had
in
last
april
on
the
present
plan
in
which
they
were
elected,
the
plaintiff
intervener's
witness,
a
mr.
cohen
pelt
(ph)
who
were
testified
before
the
ad
hoc
house
and
senate
committee,
testified
that
the
senate
--
that
the
census
tracks
would
not
be
available
until
august
of
1971,
that
is
on
page
168
of
the
transcript.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
no
your
honor.
no
sir,
no
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
that’s
correct
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
that’s
correct.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
yes
sir,
by
november
1
sir.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
in
the
decree
of
the
court.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
the
court
haven’t
been
advised
a
detailed
population
figures
for
the
state
of
arizona
will
be
available
from
the
official
1970
census
by
the
summer
of
1971,
assumed
that
there
is
the
legislation
--
will
by
november
1.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
we
think
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
well
sir,
the
state’s
position
is
that
we
have
a
deadline
and
we
have
so
instructed
legislature
that
they
have
a
deadline
of
having
a
bill
ready
for
us
to
offer
to
the
court
by
november
1.
we
have
told
the
leadership
of
the
house
and
senate
that
and
that
is
the
theory
on
which
the
state
is
operating.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
well,
no
sir,
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
figures
are
still
--
they
say
now
that
possibly
in
june,
but
mr.
cohen
pelt's
(ph)
figures
in
the
trial,
august
of
1971
because
they
have
to
break
them
down
by
census
tracks
and
in
census
tracks
in
populous
areas
means
by
blocks.
so
we
cannot
get
them
on
tape,
that’s
the
word
that
everything
operates
now
on
by
until
august
of
1971.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
early,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
but
only
a
suggestion
but
the
witness
--
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
no
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
will
not.
it
will
anticipate
as
being
over
by
the
eastertide
this
year
--
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
for
the
regular
session
and
it
will
be
called
–
i
am
sorry?
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
yes
sir.
it
will
be
called
into
special
session
for
this,
for
the
governor,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
well,
there’s
a
procedure
that
house
and
senate
--
the
governor
will
call
immediately.
there’s
going
to
be
another
special
session
on
taxes.
so
special
sessions
do
not
totally
interfere.
they
–
it's
--
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
it
is
nationwide
mr.
justice
white,
but
it’s
peculiar
to
arizona
in
this
effect
that
they
really
only
go
by
blocks
in
--
as
mr.
cohen
pelt
(ph)
testified
in
two
populous
counties.
our
smaller
counties
do
not
have
them
except
in
great
in
effect
mining
districts.
so
they
will
not
be
too
helpful
even
then.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
they
are
by
counties
now,
yes
sir
but
not
by
census
tracks
which
--
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
because
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
76
--
almost
80%
of
our
population
resided
in
two
big
counties
and
if
we
don’t
know
that’s
mr.
shea’s
principal
complaint
what
the
present
system
is
he
says
that
we
have
used
the
wrong
formula
for
the
allocation
internally
in
the
big
counties.
we
use
what
the
court
used
in
1966.
we
put
the
1968
registrations
on
a
formula
and
put
them
to
the
actual
1960
census.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
no
sir.
we
have
no
way
knowing
where
the
people
are.
it’s
difficult
in
the
last
decade.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
yes
sir.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
we
have
--
yes
sir
52%
of
arizona
reside
in
the
large
counties
which
is
15
--
which
is
one
half
of
the
senator's
districts.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
no
sir,
we
have
multi-member
for
the
house,
single
for
the
senate.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
yes
sir,
we
have
to
have.
in
1960,
one
of
the
areas
of
our
county
that
has
now
30,000
people
didn’t
even
exist
at
sun
city.
i
mean,
it
was
(inaudible).
so
that’s
why
we
have
had
to
use,
the
court
itself
in
1966
used,
the
projection
registration
to
1960
census.
the
court,
the
legislature
and
the
governor,
we
sought
direction
because
the
leadership
of
the
house
and
senate,
they
were
not
attorneys
and
they
asked
us
to
--
asked
full
advisory
opinion
which
of
course
the
court
cannot
give
us.
they
have
made
every
effort
to
blindly
follow
the
direction
of
the
court
and
they
stand
now
willing
to
do,
but
they
are
now
appealing
on
the
theory
that
they
cannot
do
anything
until
the
census
tracks
come
out
this
summer.
as
the
court
in
its
--
we
had
200
runs
of
the
computer
to
affect
this
present
system.
every
district
was
less
than
1%
deviation
which
no
other
state
in
the
union
can
brag
about.
we
had
every
district,
all
of
our
30
districts
had
less
than
1%,
maximum
of
8.7
deviation.
we
have
done
our
best
to
comply
with
the
court's
direction
and
now
we
wait
for
the
coming
of
the
census
tracks
to
go
forward
and
further
comply.
thank
you.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
because
mr.
justice
black,
the
present
legislature
with
the
beneficiaries
of
the
reapportionment
plan,
before
the
reapportionment
plan,
the
present
majority
would
never
have
been
there,
because
then
we
had
two
from
each
county
and
maricopa
county
with
700,000
people
had
two
senators.
now,
we
have
15.
so
it’s
to
their
own
self-interest
to
maintain
a
fair,
equitable,
lawful
reapportionment.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
briefly
review
for
the
court
some
of
the
history
of
this
case.
as
mr.
shea
properly
stated,
it
was
filed
in
april
1964
at
--
no
action
was
taken
in
the
legislature
because
at
that
time
this
legislature
was
in
adjournment.
it
said
we’ll
not
meet
again
until
1965
and
at
that
time,
it
made
some
passing
attempts
at
legislation.
then,
in
a
special
session,in
october
1965,
it
passed
that
--
one
house
passed
a
bill,
the
senate
passed
a
bill.
that
was
then
before
the
court
in
the
hearings
we
had
in
november
of
1965,
and
lest
there
be
a
feeling
that
the
present
majority
was
the
majority
then,
the
senate
was
elected
in
1964,
had
two
republicans
and
26
democrats,
had
35
republicans
and
45
democrats
in
the
house.
that
was
under
the
old
senate
before
reapportionment.
in
1965
we
had
a
three-day
hearing
before
then
circuit
judge
pope,
the
judge
welsh
and
i
can’t
recall
other
justices
–judge
was
there.
then
in
february
1966,
the
decree
was
issued
and
the
parties
were
told
to
agree
on
the
two
populous
counties
for
the
division
of
maricopa
and
pima
county,
an
agreement
was
is
in
effect
reached
and
the
court
changed
a
few
precincts
and
the
agreement
was
reached
between
the
major
in
effect
the
parties,
i
mean
the
political
parties.
at
that
time,
the
plaintiff
intervener
was
not
in
the
action,
it
was
between
mr.
klahr
and
the
governor,
that
time
there
was
a
democratic
governor
and
the
legislature.
the
hearing,
the
decree
was
established
the
fact
that
we
had
30
districts
in
the
states
and
each
senatorial
district
had
two
house
members.
the
counties
were
kept
together
as
units
except
in
the
two
major
counties
and
there
they
were
subdivided
by
a
formula
that
the
court
approved.
that
the
court
in
effect
suggested
and
that
was
bringing
the
1960
census
figures
up
to
date
by
ratio
of
the
voter
registration
in
the
county
to
the
precinct
involved
because
in
arizona,
the
rapid
growth
patterns,
if
we
use
census
tracks
which
if
you've
ever
read
the
census
tracks,
they
say
up
to
a
telephone
poll
in
effect
over
a
creek
and
down
to
an
old
minings
--there’s
no
legal
descriptions
in
the
sense
that
we
use
in
any
other
legal
works
and
avoiding
the
census
tracks.
so
we
used
precincts
in
the
1966
division.
in
the
election
of
1966
in
the
senate,
there
were
16
republicans
elected
and
14
democrats,
33
republicans
in
the
house
and
27
democrats.
for
the
first
time
in
history,
republican
party
had
a
majority
in
ether
house
or
both
houses.
so
i
say
that
to
you
for
this
one
reason
that
the
present
leadership
of
the
house
in
senate
are
the
beneficiaries
of
reapportionment.
if
it
was
not
for
reapportionment,
they
would
still
be
in
the
minority,
and
not
only
do
they
act
in
good
faith
in
an
attempt
to
reapportion,
it
is
to
their
own
enlightened
self-interest
because
they
would
not
be
there
without
reapportionment.
in
1967,
there
was
a
special
session
in
which
another
attempt
was
made
to
have
a
legislated
enacted
reapportionment
to
replace
the
court
decree.
that
special
session
was
in
the
spring
of
--
in
may
of
1967.
at
that
time,
the
matter
was
referred
to
the
people
and
our
constitution
says
that
5%
of
the
voters
may
refer
to
the
people
any
bill.
no
bill
becomes
a
law
for
90
days.
so
prior
to
its
effective
date,
this
was
referred
to
the
people
by
5%
of
the
electorate
which
meant
it
went
to
the
ballot
in
1968.
the
people
approved
it
in
1968,
and
we
had
a
hearing
in
january
of
1969
in
which
the
court
struck
down
house
bill
1
it
was
called,
because
it
did
not
follow
--
it
did
use
registration
figures
only
because
in
the
meantime,
the
kirkpatrick
and
the
rockefeller
case
had
come
down.
at
the
time
of
the
first
decree
in
1966,
the
court
was
laboring
under
the
thought
as
mr.
frank
reminded
them
in
our
hearing
last
spring
of
a
so-called
seller
amendment
which
was
then
pending
in
the
congress
that
we
could
have
a
15%
variation
in
figures.
that
as
--
following
this
court’s
decision
in
kirkpatrick
no
longer
of
course
is
the
case.
in
the
hearing
we
had
in
last
april
on
the
present
plan
in
which
they
were
elected,
the
plaintiff
intervener's
witness,
a
mr.

who
were
testified
before
the
ad
hoc
house
and
senate
committee,
testified
that
the
senate
--
that
the
census
tracks
would
not
be
available
until
august
of
1971,
that
is
on
page

of
the
transcript.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
no
your
honor.
no
sir,
no
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
that’s
correct
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
that’s
correct.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
yes
sir,
by
november
1
sir.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
in
the
decree
of
the
court.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
the
court
haven’t
been
advised
a
detailed
population
figures
for
the
state
of
arizona
will
be
available
from
the
official
1970
census
by
the
summer
of
1971,
assumed
that
there
is
the
legislation
--
will
by
november
1.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
we
think
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
well
sir,
the
state’s
position
is
that
we
have
a
deadline
and
we
have
so
instructed
legislature
that
they
have
a
deadline
of
having
a
bill
ready
for
us
to
offer
to
the
court
by
november
1.
we
have
told
the
leadership
of
the
house
and
senate
that
and
that
is
the
theory
on
which
the
state
is
operating.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
well,
no
sir,
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
figures
are
still
--
they
say
now
that
possibly
in
june,
but
mr.
cohen
pelt's
(ph)
figures
in
the
trial,
august
of
1971
because
they
have
to
break
them
down
by
census
tracks
and
in
census
tracks
in
populous
areas
means
by
blocks.
so
we
cannot
get
them
on
tape,
that’s
the
word
that
everything
operates
now
on
by
until
august
of
1971.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
early,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
but
only
a
suggestion
but
the
witness
--
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
no
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
will
not.
it
will
anticipate
as
being
over
by
the
eastertide
this
year
--
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
for
the
regular
session
and
it
will
be
called
–
i
am
sorry?
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
yes
sir.
it
will
be
called
into
special
session
for
this,
for
the
governor,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
well,
there’s
a
procedure
that
house
and
senate
--
the
governor
will
call
immediately.
there’s
going
to
be
another
special
session
on
taxes.
so
special
sessions
do
not
totally
interfere.
they
–
it's
--
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
it
is
nationwide
mr.
justice
white,
but
it’s
peculiar
to
arizona
in
this
effect
that
they
really
only
go
by
blocks
in
--
as
mr.
cohen
pelt
(ph)
testified
in
two
populous
counties.
our
smaller
counties
do
not
have
them
except
in
great
in
effect
mining
districts.
so
they
will
not
be
too
helpful
even
then.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
they
are
by
counties
now,
yes
sir
but
not
by
census
tracks
which
--
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
because
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
76
--
almost
80%
of
our
population
resided
in
two
big
counties
and
if
we
don’t
know
that’s
mr.
shea’s
principal
complaint
what
the
present
system
is
he
says
that
we
have
used
the
wrong
formula
for
the
allocation
internally
in
the
big
counties.
we
use
what
the
court
used
in
1966.
we
put
the
1968
registrations
on
a
formula
and
put
them
to
the
actual
1960
census.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
no
sir.
we
have
no
way
knowing
where
the
people
are.
it’s
difficult
in
the
last
decade.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
yes
sir.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
we
have
--
yes
sir
52%
of
arizona
reside
in
the
large
counties
which
is
15
--
which
is
one
half
of
the
senator's
districts.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
no
sir,
we
have
multi-member
for
the
house,
single
for
the
senate.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
yes
sir,
we
have
to
have.
in
1960,
one
of
the
areas
of
our
county
that
has
now
30,000
people
didn’t
even
exist
at
sun
city.
i
mean,
it
was
(inaudible).
so
that’s
why
we
have
had
to
use,
the
court
itself
in
1966
used,
the
projection
registration
to
1960
census.
the
court,
the
legislature
and
the
governor,
we
sought
direction
because
the
leadership
of
the
house
and
senate,
they
were
not
attorneys
and
they
asked
us
to
--
asked
full
advisory
opinion
which
of
course
the
court
cannot
give
us.
they
have
made
every
effort
to
blindly
follow
the
direction
of
the
court
and
they
stand
now
willing
to
do,
but
they
are
now
appealing
on
the
theory
that
they
cannot
do
anything
until
the
census
tracks
come
out
this
summer.
as
the
court
in
its
--
we
had
200
runs
of
the
computer
to
affect
this
present
system.
every
district
was
less
than
1%
deviation
which
no
other
state
in
the
union
can
brag
about.
we
had
every
district,
all
of
our
30
districts
had
less
than
1%,
maximum
of
8.7
deviation.
we
have
done
our
best
to
comply
with
the
court's
direction
and
now
we
wait
for
the
coming
of
the
census
tracks
to
go
forward
and
further
comply.
thank
you.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
because
mr.
justice
black,
the
present
legislature
with
the
beneficiaries
of
the
reapportionment
plan,
before
the
reapportionment
plan,
the
present
majority
would
never
have
been
there,
because
then
we
had
two
from
each
county
and
maricopa
county
with
700,000
people
had
two
senators.
now,
we
have
15.
so
it’s
to
their
own
self-interest
to
maintain
a
fair,
equitable,
lawful
reapportionment.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan,
ii
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan,
yes
sir.
