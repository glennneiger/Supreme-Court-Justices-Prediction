mr.
philip
j.
shea
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
raised
by
this
appeal
that
a
three-judge
district
court
sitting
in
phoenix,
arizona
by
its
decree
of
may
19,
1970,
abused
its
discretion
and
committed
error
by
refusing
to
assure
a
preliminary
injunction
to
enjoin
the
operation
of
the
admittedly
unconstitutional
reapportionment
plan
and
the
reapportionment
was
before
the
court
enacted
by
a
special
session
of
a
state
legislature
and
signed
into
law
on
january
22,
1970.
as
in
all
prior
apportionment
statues
before
it,
it
stubbornly
clung
to
the
idea
that
reapportionment
should
be
brought
about
on
the
basis
of
voter
registration
and
not
on
the
basis
of
people.
now,
the
use
of
voter
registration
as
distinguished
from
the
use
of
population,
of
people
in
arizona
has
a
particularly
invidious
discriminatory
effect.
it
probably
would
in
any
place
because
of
poor
people
and
certain
minorities
don’t
register
as
much
other
people,
as
much
as
effluent.
it
is
particularly
so
in
arizona.
the
northeastern
part
of
the
state
of
arizona
which
is
one-sixth
of
a
very
large
state,
contains
the
highest
concentration
of
indians
of
any
area
in
the
united
states.
there
are
about
70,000
american
indians,
navajos
and
hopis
and
some
apaches.
the
average
sized
district,
the
legislative
district
in
arizona
is
54,000
people.
the
70,000
people
in
the
northeastern
part,
70,000
indians
in
northeastern
arizona
are
still
under
this
reapportionment
plan
dominated
by
their
white
neighbors
to
the
south.
in
south
phoenix
of
this,
a
very
poor
area,
it
is
mostly
poor
black,
poor
mexican-american,
poor
white.
in
the
legislative
district
in
south
phoenix
and
it’s
just
one,
there
are
70,000
people
in
an
area
in
northeastern
phoenix,
an
area
which
all
white,
an
area
which
is
affluent.
there
are
27,000
people,
more
than
twice
as
many
people
in
south
phoenix
in
a
district
as
in
northeastern
phoenix.
now,
this
discrimination
of
course
is
invidious,
of
course
it’s
horrible
and
so
we
complain
that
court
committed
error,
it
clearly
abused
its
discretion
by
refusing
to
enjoin
it.
the
voter
registration
as
the
basis
of
the
apportionment
of
arizona
has
along
history.
as
matter
of
fact,
it’s
the
only
way
we
got
the
reapportion
of
legislature,
at
least
the
lower
house,
beginning
with
the
adoption
of
the
arizona
constitution
in
1913
which
is
the
basis
of
--
which
was
the
original
statement
of
the
apportionment
arrangement.
the
lower
house,
the
house
of
representatives
is
a
portion
with
a
basis
of
a
voter
registration.
the
upper
house,
the
state
senate
was
then
apportioned
on
the
basis
of
county
representation,
two
members
from
each
county.
now,
this
suit
was
failed
by
gary
peter
klahr,
then
a
third
year
law
student,
in
april
1964.
the
law
at
that
time
seems
quite
clear.
this
court
had
seem
to
--
made
it
simple
and
flat
and
direct
statement,
“there
should
be
one
man,
one
vote.”
nevertheless,
the
court
did
not
act
on
the
complaint
and
did
not
hold
hearings
on
it
until
about
a-year-and-a-half,
more
than
a-year-and-a-half
later.
it
was
waiting
patiently,
the
legislation
to
the
job
for
the
reason
that
i’m
sure
the
attorney
general
is
going
to
say
here
today
that
the
legislative
should
be
given
an
opportunity
to
do
to
remedy
the
wrong.
now,
legislature
more
than
a
year
after
the
suit
was
filed,
enacted
something
called
senate
bill
11
which
provided
for
a
terribly
malapportioned
state
senate
and
it
didn’t
deal
whatever
with
terribly
malapportioned
house
of
representatives.
the
--
after
a
hearing
on
that
bill,
the
court
by
its
decree
and
it
was
first
decree
issued
in
this
case,
the
decree
of
february
22,
1966,
held
that
the
constitutional
arrangement
of
both
houses
was
unconstitution
--
that
is
the
arizona
constitution
arrangement
was
unconstitutional
under
u.s.
fourteenth
amendment.
and
also
that
senate
bill
11
was
unconstitutional
and
went
on
to
impose
a
court
plan
what
it
in
its
decree
called
a
temporary
plan,
temporary
provisional
plan,
that
was
based
on
voter
registration.
at
least,
it
was
based
on
voter
registration
in
the
urban
areas
of
phoenix
and
tucson
and
outside
of
the
counties
including
phoenix
and
tucson,
the
rural
counties,
a
portion
was
based
on
county,
1966
counties,
census
of
following
respecting
county
lines.
now,
the
malapportionment
resulting
from
the
use
of
this
system,
that
is
to
say
voter
registration
in
the
cities
and
respecting
county
lines
in
rural
areas
was
gross.
they
were
--
the
deviation
was
plus
16%
to
cent
i
believe
to
minus
6%
and
that’s
just
in
the
county
areas.
there’s
no
way
of
computing
how
gross
much
more
gross
the
malapportionment
was
under
that
plan
in
the
urban
areas
where
voter
registration
was
used.
nonetheless,
this
temporary
provisional
plan,
so-called
was
used
in
1966
and
again
in
1968,
the
legislature
still
having
failed
to
act
in
a
valid
way.
the
legislator
did
enact,
try
its
hand
then
again
in
1967
and
it
was
declared
unconstitutional
and
then
it
came
back
in
1969.
now,
the
arguments,
physical
arguments
on
part
of
the
respondent
is
not
that
the
plan
is
in
effect,
the
new
temporary
provisional
plan,
not
that
it’s
constitutional.
it’s
grossly
malapportionment.
it’s
a
gross
case
of
malapportionment.
the
argument
is
that
well
the
court
ordered
that
this
plan
be
used
in
the
elections
of
the
november
1970,
and
therefore,
it
loses
its
affect,
loses
its
sting
after
that.
and
the
reason
that
we
came
here
to
complain
was
the
history
does
not
show
that
the
malapportionment
plan
loses
its
sting
the
day
after
the
election
and
that
it
goes
away.
the
decree
of
february
22,
1966,
set
up
a
plan
which
was
used
not
only
in
‘66
but
in
‘68
and
why
isn’t
something
done.
the
fact
is
the
court
can
insist
on
sitting
back
and
waiting
for
the
legislature
to
act
which
is
very
nice
and
they
should
give
them
a
reasonable
a
chance,
but
seven
years
is
a
far
too
long.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
yes,
it
is.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
no
i
think
they
set
until
they
finish
their
work
and
i
believed
mr.
mcgowan
is
close
to
the
situation.
i
think
they
have
in
mind
a
special
session
later
on.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
yes.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
that
means
that
they’ll
open
the
doors
to
us
after
november
1,
1971.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
yes,
until
then
the
doors
are
close
to
us.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
well,
that’s
a
lot
--
mr.
philip
j.
shea
there
has
to
be
a
new
plan
anyway,
right.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
what’s
left
aside
here
is
whether
this
court
--
mr.
philip
j.
shea
well,
it’s
a
nice
opinion
but
i
don’t
agree
with
what
it
did.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
yes.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
yes
i
do.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
never
have
something
else
happen
now.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
a
reapportionment
plan,
right
away.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
by
the
court,
that’s
the
only
way
were
going
to
get
it.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
no,
by
three-judge
court
sitting
in
the
phoenix.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
it’s
says
that
--
what
it
said,
i
believe
was
that
if
the
legislature
fails
to
act,
validly
by
november
1,
1971,
any
party
may
petition
for
further
relief
and
that’s
not
to
say
i
don’t
believe
but
if
the
court
is
going
to
impose
itself
on
a
constitutional
plan
and
again
--
mr.
philip
j.
shea
yes.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
no,
but
if
they
open
door
to
us
we’ll
have
one
in
jiffy.
of
course,
we
had
one
last
year
in
april
of
1970.
we
had
a
plan
based
on
population.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
no,
we
haven’t.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
well,
we
take
--
mr.
philip
j.
shea
we
take
it
from
the
opinion
of
the
court,
we
take
the
court
as
it
were
that
it
won’t
hear
us
before
november
1,
1971.
that’s
what
we
really
we
want
to
do.
we
want
to
get
the
figures
and
put
on
a
census
map
and
get
a
fair
apportionment
plan
and
have
the
court
order
it
and
have
that
become
a
law
of
the
state
until
such
time
as
the
legislature
does
as
good
or
a
better
job.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
no.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
yes,
i
take
it,
mr.
justice
white
that
they
agree
with
that.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
well,
the
legislature
had
again
history,
i
guess
there’s
no
basis
for
being
(inaudible)
about
what
the
legislature
is
going
to
do.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
well,
we
had
baker
against
carr.
we
even
had
wells
and
rockefeller
and
all
the
rest.
we
know
what
the
truth
is.
we
know
the
law
is.
we’ve
always
known
it,
but
yet
the
legislature
time
and
time
again
exhibits
this
stubborn
refusal
to
follow
the
law.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
no,
there
is
no
issue
to
what
should
be
done.
we
all
know
what
the
law
is.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
that’s
right
which
you
call
substantive,
yes.
the
question
is
--
mr.
philip
j.
shea
i
wish
i
could
have
said
it
as
well.
that’s
exactly
what
i
want,
yes.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
again
mr.
chief
justice,
the
court
said
that
we
may
then
petition
to
say,
but
the
reason
that
we’re
upset
is
that
the
court
had
in
april
of
1970,
had
all
the
population
figure,
the
best
population
figures
around,
had
a
plan
before
it.
we
could
have
had
population
in
the
1970’s
elections.
we
could
have
had
a
fair
plan
by
the
1970’s
and
we’re
not
so
confident
now,
but
first
of
all,
we’re
very
doubtful
that
malapportioned
legislature
is
going
to
reapportion
itself.
so,
it
is
very
leadership
is
decimated.
we
can’t
really
expect
that.
it
hasn’t
happen
in
the
past
and
we
can’t
expect
it
again.
we
can’t
expect
the
court,
we're
not
terribly
optimistic
about
the
court
fashioning
proper
relief.
when
we
come
to
our
hearing
in
1972,
after
filling
a
petition
on
november
1
and
november
2,
we
can’t
be
so
optimistic
that
the
court
would
then
presented
with
another
population
plan
is
going
to
do
anything
different
than
it
did
in
april
of
1970.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
no,
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
don’t
want
you
to
reapportion
the
state.
i
want
you
to
tell
the
court
below
to
hear
us
right
away
on
a
population
plan
and
to
order
it
in
effect.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
exactly.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
exactly.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
well
--
mr.
philip
j.
shea
in
november,
of
even
numbered
years.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
well,
coinciding
with
the
presidential
election.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
the
indications
are
that
they
will
not.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
well
first
of
all
–
well,
there’s
a
double-edged
question.
first
of
all,
there’s
the
time
and
secondly
there’s
the
fact
that
the
court
has
not
said
that
it
would
impose
a
plan.
so
what
we'd
like
is
to
--
for
this
court
to
say
open
your
doors
right
away
and
when
you
open
the
doors,
if
a
constitutional
plan
is
submitted
to
you
based
on
population,
impose
it.
and
if
no
one
can
do
it
(inaudible)
and
everyone
will
do
it,
everyone
will
get
together
then,
nobody
wants
that.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
well,
as
i
say
the
complaint
was
filed
in
--
what
done
particularly
mr.
justice
black?
to
get
a
constitutional
plan?
mr.
philip
j.
shea
well
the
complaint
was
filed
in
april
1964.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
yes,
so
it’s
a
seven-year
case
now.
that’s
again
one
of
the
reasons
why
we’re
not
terribly
optimistic
about
what’s
going
to
happen
next
few
months
because
we
don’t
feel
that
people
have
shown
the
will
to
go
ahead
and
to
do
what
--
they
are
just
reluctant
to
do.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
the
courts
and
the
legislature.
the
courts
have
been
too
indulgent
and
too
patient
we
believe
with
legislature.
we
have
no
reason
to
think
that
the
legislature
is
going
to
all
of
a
sudden
has
some
inner
resurrection
and
get
religion.
it
hasn't
in
the
past
and
it’s
--
the
legislature
is
malapportioned
as
ever.
it
seems
amazing
since
i
have
been
in
this,
the
sense
of
territory
that
legislators
have,
it’s
like
animals.
they
belong
to
a
sense
of
territory,
i
mean
territory
is
the
area
from
which
they
are
reluctant.
and
they’ll
go
kicking
and
screaming
before
they
change
it
and
that’s
particularly
true
when
you
have
legislatures
we
now
have
with
a
control
by
the
majority
party
from
these
people
that
are
from
northeast
phoenix,
where
they
have
27,000
people.
and
when
they
start
reapportioning,
half
of
them
have
to
go
or
a
good
number
of
them
have
to
go.
we
can’t
really
quite
say
that
legislatures
--
it
has
been
my
experience
in
the
past,
they
don’t
just
do
that.
so
we
are
very
--
have
no
optimism
whatever
that
the
legislature
is
going
to
do
the
right
thing
and
we
don’t
have
any
optimism
that
the
--
that
the
court
is
going
to
say
we’ll
do
it
or
run
at
large
or
bring
us
a
plan
so
that
we
can
do
something
and
we’ll
order
it
in
effect.
so
for
this
reason
we’re
seeking
the
order
of
this
court
to
order
the
three-judge
court
to
open
its
doors
to
us
right
way,
or
to
any
party
right
away
and
to
impose
a
plan
in
this
constitution.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
the
judges
were
ninth
circuit
judge
gilbert
jertberg,
tucson
district
court
judge
james
a.
walsh,
and
phoenix
district
court
judge
walter
craig.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
no
mr.
justice
marshall
i
don’t
think
that
we
need
to
have
a
time
limit.
i
think
if
--
mr.
philip
j.
shea
well,
if
the
court
is
required
to
open
its
doors
to
us,
we
will
be
done
well
before
then.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
well,
the
court
--
mr.
philip
j.
shea
to
an
extent.
the
term
guidelines
mr.
justice
marshall
is
kind
of
confusing,
because
you
see
the
district
court
by
its
decree
of
may
19,
1970
filed
an
opinion
in
the
thing
which
set
guidelines
which
are
very
enlightened,
set
them
for
the
legislature,
but
refused
to
order,
to
make
any
specific
order
as
to
what
would
happen,
as
to
what
should
happen.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
exactly,
mr.
justice
black,
exactly.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
yes,
i
think
that
--
mr.
philip
j.
shea
if
the
court
made
one,
then
the
legislature
could
only
get
its
plan
approved
if
it
enacted
one
just
as
good
or
better
and
it
would
do
so.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
i
don’t
--
yes,
i
think
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
i
think
that
mr.
justice
white
really
on
the
basis
of
experience
again
that
these
nice
decisions
are
going
to
be
made
by
the
legislature
when
the
next
legislature
--
right
after
a
properly,
a
legislature
is
elected
on
the
basis
of
a
properly
apportioned
plan.
you’re
not
going
to
have
a
nice
constitutional
plan
come
out
of
a
terribly
malapportioned
legislature.
i
don’t
think
it’s
going
to
be
before
--
until
after
the
election
of
1972,
that
we
get
a
legislative
plan
that
cuts
the
mustard,
and
then
only
if
we
have
reapportionment
before
1972,
that’s
all
your
honor.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
i’d
like
to
respond
briefly
if
i
may
to
a
couple
of
points.
the
first
one
is
critically
important
and
that
is
the
availability
of
the
figures
because
that
has
so
much
to
do
with
the
timing
and
say
that
we
now
have
the
population
70
--
population
figures
by
county.
well,
that
is
to
say
that
the
1970
population
figures
by
county
is
published
in
a
little
pamphlet
that
you
buy
for
35
cents,
it
doesn’t
mean
it's
the
only
figures
available.
it
said
that
this
summer,
and
possibly
in
june
the
other
figures,
the
more
complete
figures
which
we
all
agree
are
necessary,
the
census
track
figures
are
available
in
tapes.
well,
you
can
call
this
number
here
of
the
u.s
census
bureau
in
washington,
d.c
and
they’ll
say
well,
we
don’t
have
them
on
tapes
and
we
don’t
have
them
on
a
brochure
that
costs
35
cents.
but,
they
are
there,
you
see,
they
are
there
if
anybody
has
the
will
to
find
them,
to
dig
them
out
to
do
these
things.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
i
don’t
know
if
there
is
any
process
of
informatory
certification
at
any
stage.
all
i
am
saying
is
they’re
available.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
i
don’t
know.
i
frankly
don’t
know
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
well,
i
don’t
know
if
they’re
officially
certified,
and
then
between
perhaps
now
and
if
they
have
not
been
but
--
mr.
philip
j.
shea
i’d
get
them
from
the
united
states
department,
the
bureau,
the
census
in
washington,
d.c.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
i
am
frankly
not
familiar
with
the
process
of
the
certification
of
figures.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
mr.
mcgowan
and
i
are
in
complete
disagreement
on
that.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
because
my
experience
is
that
a
legislature
does
not
reapportion
itself,
so
as
to
disseminate
its
leadership
and
that’s
what's
going
to
have
to
happen.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
yes,
they
did.
now
that
those
new
set
of
figures
are
going
to
have
to
disappear,
because
they
all
can’t
get
returned
if
the
right
thing
is
done.
that’s
the
problem
with
going
--
of
temperizing
with
unconstitutional
plans.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
no.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
yes.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
although
i
take
his
word
for,
in
other
words,
their
leaders
set
around
in
a
room
and
they
say
well,
you
know
the
court
said
by
november
1
--
mr.
philip
j.
shea
no,
he
says
that
they
intend
to
act
before
november
1,
1971
because
they
regarded
it
some
kind
of
a
moral
time
limit.[attempt
to
laughter]
mr.
philip
j.
shea
right,
and
that’s
what
i
dispute
too.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
no,
i
don’t
sir.
no.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
well,
he
makes
the
statement
in
all
good
faith
and
he’s
a
man
who
is
close
to
the
leadership
and
i
am
sure
he
is
accurately
reporting
what
he
advices
them
what
they
say
they
will
do.
i
have
no
doubt
that
they’ll
get
some
figures
and
go
into
a
special
session
though
i
have
every
doubt
in
the
world
that
they
are
going
to,
as
i
said,
decimate
their
leadership.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
we’re
going
to
go
back
to
court,
i
have
no
doubt
about
that.
we
go
back
to
court,
it
will
be
1972,
and
then
they’ll
say
it’s
too
late
to
appeal
again
and
then
nine
years
ill
pass.
so
i
think
that
what
we'd
like
to
do
is
have
it
straighten
out
now.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
raised
by
this
appeal
that
a
three-judge
district
court
sitting
in
phoenix,
arizona
by
its
decree
of
may
19,
1970,
abused
its
discretion
and
committed
error
by
refusing
to
assure
a
preliminary
injunction
to
enjoin
the
operation
of
the
admittedly
unconstitutional
reapportionment
plan
and
the
reapportionment
was
before
the
court
enacted
by
a
special
session
of
a
state
legislature
and
signed
into
law
on
january
22,
1970.
as
in
all
prior
apportionment
statues
before
it,
it
stubbornly
clung
to
the
idea
that
reapportionment
should
be
brought
about
on
the
basis
of
voter
registration
and
not
on
the
basis
of
people.
now,
the
use
of
voter
registration
as
distinguished
from
the
use
of
population,
of
people
in
arizona
has
a
particularly
invidious
discriminatory
effect.
it
probably
would
in
any
place
because
of
poor
people
and
certain
minorities
don’t
register
as
much
other
people,
as
much
as
effluent.
it
is
particularly
so
in
arizona.
the
northeastern
part
of
the
state
of
arizona
which
is
one-sixth
of
a
very
large
state,
contains
the
highest
concentration
of
indians
of
any
area
in
the
united
states.
there
are
about
70,000
american
indians,
navajos
and
hopis
and
some
apaches.
the
average
sized
district,
the
legislative
district
in
arizona
is
54,000
people.
the
70,000
people
in
the
northeastern
part,
70,000
indians
in
northeastern
arizona
are
still
under
this
reapportionment
plan
dominated
by
their
white
neighbors
to
the
south.
in
south
phoenix
of
this,
a
very
poor
area,
it
is
mostly
poor
black,
poor
mexican-american,
poor
white.
in
the
legislative
district
in
south
phoenix
and
it’s
just
one,
there
are
70,000
people
in
an
area
in
northeastern
phoenix,
an
area
which
all
white,
an
area
which
is
affluent.
there
are
27,000
people,
more
than
twice
as
many
people
in
south
phoenix
in
a
district
as
in
northeastern
phoenix.
now,
this
discrimination
of
course
is
invidious,
of
course
it’s
horrible
and
so
we
complain
that
court
committed
error,
it
clearly
abused
its
discretion
by
refusing
to
enjoin
it.
the
voter
registration
as
the
basis
of
the
apportionment
of
arizona
has
along
history.
as
matter
of
fact,
it’s
the
only
way
we
got
the
reapportion
of
legislature,
at
least
the
lower
house,
beginning
with
the
adoption
of
the
arizona
constitution
in
1913
which
is
the
basis
of
--
which
was
the
original
statement
of
the
apportionment
arrangement.
the
lower
house,
the
house
of
representatives
is
a
portion
with
a
basis
of
a
voter
registration.
the
upper
house,
the
state
senate
was
then
apportioned
on
the
basis
of
county
representation,
two
members
from
each
county.
now,
this
suit
was
failed
by
gary
peter
klahr,
then
a
third
year
law
student,
in
april
1964.
the
law
at
that
time
seems
quite
clear.
this
court
had
seem
to
--
made
it
simple
and
flat
and
direct
statement,
“there
should
be
one
man,
one
vote.”
nevertheless,
the
court
did
not
act
on
the
complaint
and
did
not
hold
hearings
on
it
until
about
a-year-and-a-half,
more
than
a-year-and-a-half
later.
it
was
waiting
patiently,
the
legislation
to
the
job
for
the
reason
that
i’m
sure
the
attorney
general
is
going
to
say
here
today
that
the
legislative
should
be
given
an
opportunity
to
do
to
remedy
the
wrong.
now,
legislature
more
than
a
year
after
the
suit
was
filed,
enacted
something
called
senate
bill
11
which
provided
for
a
terribly
malapportioned
state
senate
and
it
didn’t
deal
whatever
with
terribly
malapportioned
house
of
representatives.
the
--
after
a
hearing
on
that
bill,
the
court
by
its
decree
and
it
was
first
decree
issued
in
this
case,
the
decree
of
february
22,
1966,
held
that
the
constitutional
arrangement
of
both
houses
was
unconstitution
--
that
is
the
arizona
constitution
arrangement
was
unconstitutional
under
u.s.
fourteenth
amendment.
and
also
that
senate
bill
11
was
unconstitutional
and
went
on
to
impose
a
court
plan
what
it
in
its
decree
called
a
temporary
plan,
temporary
provisional
plan,
that
was
based
on
voter
registration.
at
least,
it
was
based
on
voter
registration
in
the
urban
areas
of
phoenix
and
tucson
and
outside
of
the
counties
including
phoenix
and
tucson,
the
rural
counties,
a
portion
was
based
on
county,
1966
counties,
census
of
following
respecting
county
lines.
now,
the
malapportionment
resulting
from
the
use
of
this
system,
that
is
to
say
voter
registration
in
the
cities
and
respecting
county
lines
in
rural
areas
was
gross.
they
were
--
the
deviation
was
plus
16%
to
cent
i
believe
to
minus
6%
and
that’s
just
in
the
county
areas.
there’s
no
way
of
computing
how
gross
much
more
gross
the
malapportionment
was
under
that
plan
in
the
urban
areas
where
voter
registration
was
used.
nonetheless,
this
temporary
provisional
plan,
so-called
was
used
in
1966
and
again
in
1968,
the
legislature
still
having
failed
to
act
in
a
valid
way.
the
legislator
did
enact,
try
its
hand
then
again
in
1967
and
it
was
declared
unconstitutional
and
then
it
came
back
in
1969.
now,
the
arguments,
physical
arguments
on
part
of
the
respondent
is
not
that
the
plan
is
in
effect,
the
new
temporary
provisional
plan,
not
that
it’s
constitutional.
it’s
grossly
malapportionment.
it’s
a
gross
case
of
malapportionment.
the
argument
is
that
well
the
court
ordered
that
this
plan
be
used
in
the
elections
of
the
november
1970,
and
therefore,
it
loses
its
affect,
loses
its
sting
after
that.
and
the
reason
that
we
came
here
to
complain
was
the
history
does
not
show
that
the
malapportionment
plan
loses
its
sting
the
day
after
the
election
and
that
it
goes
away.
the
decree
of
february
22,
1966,
set
up
a
plan
which
was
used
not
only
in
‘66
but
in
‘68
and
why
isn’t
something
done.
the
fact
is
the
court
can
insist
on
sitting
back
and
waiting
for
the
legislature
to
act
which
is
very
nice
and
they
should
give
them
a
reasonable
a
chance,
but
seven
years
is
a
far
too
long.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
yes,
it
is.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
no
i
think
they
set
until
they
finish
their
work
and
i
believed
mr.
mcgowan
is
close
to
the
situation.
i
think
they
have
in
mind
a
special
session
later
on.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
yes.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
that
means
that
they’ll
open
the
doors
to
us
after
november
1,
1971.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
yes,
until
then
the
doors
are
close
to
us.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
well,
that’s
a
lot
--
mr.
philip
j.
shea
there
has
to
be
a
new
plan
anyway,
right.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
what’s
left
aside
here
is
whether
this
court
--
mr.
philip
j.
shea
well,
it’s
a
nice
opinion
but
i
don’t
agree
with
what
it
did.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
yes.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
yes
i
do.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
never
have
something
else
happen
now.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
a
reapportionment
plan,
right
away.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
by
the
court,
that’s
the
only
way
were
going
to
get
it.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
no,
by
three-judge
court
sitting
in
the
phoenix.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
it’s
says
that
--
what
it
said,
i
believe
was
that
if
the
legislature
fails
to
act,
validly
by
november
1,
1971,
any
party
may
petition
for
further
relief
and
that’s
not
to
say
i
don’t
believe
but
if
the
court
is
going
to
impose
itself
on
a
constitutional
plan
and
again
--
mr.
philip
j.
shea
yes.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
no,
but
if
they
open
door
to
us
we’ll
have
one
in
jiffy.
of
course,
we
had
one
last
year
in
april
of
1970.
we
had
a
plan
based
on
population.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
no,
we
haven’t.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
well,
we
take
--
mr.
philip
j.
shea
we
take
it
from
the
opinion
of
the
court,
we
take
the
court
as
it
were
that
it
won’t
hear
us
before
november
1,
1971.
that’s
what
we
really
we
want
to
do.
we
want
to
get
the
figures
and
put
on
a
census
map
and
get
a
fair
apportionment
plan
and
have
the
court
order
it
and
have
that
become
a
law
of
the
state
until
such
time
as
the
legislature
does
as
good
or
a
better
job.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
no.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
yes,
i
take
it,
mr.
justice
white
that
they
agree
with
that.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
well,
the
legislature
had
again
history,
i
guess
there’s
no
basis
for
being
(inaudible)
about
what
the
legislature
is
going
to
do.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
well,
we
had
baker
against
carr.
we
even
had
wells
and
rockefeller
and
all
the
rest.
we
know
what
the
truth
is.
we
know
the
law
is.
we’ve
always
known
it,
but
yet
the
legislature
time
and
time
again
exhibits
this
stubborn
refusal
to
follow
the
law.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
no,
there
is
no
issue
to
what
should
be
done.
we
all
know
what
the
law
is.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
that’s
right
which
you
call
substantive,
yes.
the
question
is
--
mr.
philip
j.
shea
i
wish
i
could
have
said
it
as
well.
that’s
exactly
what
i
want,
yes.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
again
mr.
chief
justice,
the
court
said
that
we
may
then
petition
to
say,
but
the
reason
that
we’re
upset
is
that
the
court
had
in
april
of
1970,
had
all
the
population
figure,
the
best
population
figures
around,
had
a
plan
before
it.
we
could
have
had
population
in
the
1970’s
elections.
we
could
have
had
a
fair
plan
by
the
1970’s
and
we’re
not
so
confident
now,
but
first
of
all,
we’re
very
doubtful
that
malapportioned
legislature
is
going
to
reapportion
itself.
so,
it
is
very
leadership
is
decimated.
we
can’t
really
expect
that.
it
hasn’t
happen
in
the
past
and
we
can’t
expect
it
again.
we
can’t
expect
the
court,
we're
not
terribly
optimistic
about
the
court
fashioning
proper
relief.
when
we
come
to
our
hearing
in
1972,
after
filling
a
petition
on
november
1
and
november
2,
we
can’t
be
so
optimistic
that
the
court
would
then
presented
with
another
population
plan
is
going
to
do
anything
different
than
it
did
in
april
of
1970.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
no,
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
don’t
want
you
to
reapportion
the
state.
i
want
you
to
tell
the
court
below
to
hear
us
right
away
on
a
population
plan
and
to
order
it
in
effect.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
exactly.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
exactly.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
well
--
mr.
philip
j.
shea
in
november,
of
even
numbered
years.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
well,
coinciding
with
the
presidential
election.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
the
indications
are
that
they
will
not.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
well
first
of
all
–
well,
there’s
a
double-edged
question.
first
of
all,
there’s
the
time
and
secondly
there’s
the
fact
that
the
court
has
not
said
that
it
would
impose
a
plan.
so
what
we'd
like
is
to
--
for
this
court
to
say
open
your
doors
right
away
and
when
you
open
the
doors,
if
a
constitutional
plan
is
submitted
to
you
based
on
population,
impose
it.
and
if
no
one
can
do
it
(inaudible)
and
everyone
will
do
it,
everyone
will
get
together
then,
nobody
wants
that.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
well,
as
i
say
the
complaint
was
filed
in
--
what
done
particularly
mr.
justice
black?
to
get
a
constitutional
plan?
mr.
philip
j.
shea
well
the
complaint
was
filed
in
april
1964.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
yes,
so
it’s
a
seven-year
case
now.
that’s
again
one
of
the
reasons
why
we’re
not
terribly
optimistic
about
what’s
going
to
happen
next
few
months
because
we
don’t
feel
that
people
have
shown
the
will
to
go
ahead
and
to
do
what
--
they
are
just
reluctant
to
do.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
the
courts
and
the
legislature.
the
courts
have
been
too
indulgent
and
too
patient
we
believe
with
legislature.
we
have
no
reason
to
think
that
the
legislature
is
going
to
all
of
a
sudden
has
some
inner
resurrection
and
get
religion.
it
hasn't
in
the
past
and
it’s
--
the
legislature
is
malapportioned
as
ever.
it
seems
amazing
since
i
have
been
in
this,
the
sense
of
territory
that
legislators
have,
it’s
like
animals.
they
belong
to
a
sense
of
territory,
i
mean
territory
is
the
area
from
which
they
are
reluctant.
and
they’ll
go
kicking
and
screaming
before
they
change
it
and
that’s
particularly
true
when
you
have
legislatures
we
now
have
with
a
control
by
the
majority
party
from
these
people
that
are
from
northeast
phoenix,
where
they
have
27,000
people.
and
when
they
start
reapportioning,
half
of
them
have
to
go
or
a
good
number
of
them
have
to
go.
we
can’t
really
quite
say
that
legislatures
--
it
has
been
my
experience
in
the
past,
they
don’t
just
do
that.
so
we
are
very
--
have
no
optimism
whatever
that
the
legislature
is
going
to
do
the
right
thing
and
we
don’t
have
any
optimism
that
the
--
that
the
court
is
going
to
say
we’ll
do
it
or
run
at
large
or
bring
us
a
plan
so
that
we
can
do
something
and
we’ll
order
it
in
effect.
so
for
this
reason
we’re
seeking
the
order
of
this
court
to
order
the
three-judge
court
to
open
its
doors
to
us
right
way,
or
to
any
party
right
away
and
to
impose
a
plan
in
this
constitution.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
the
judges
were
ninth
circuit
judge
gilbert
jertberg,
tucson
district
court
judge
james
a.
walsh,
and
phoenix
district
court
judge
walter
craig.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
no
mr.
justice
marshall
i
don’t
think
that
we
need
to
have
a
time
limit.
i
think
if
--
mr.
philip
j.
shea
well,
if
the
court
is
required
to
open
its
doors
to
us,
we
will
be
done
well
before
then.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
well,
the
court
--
mr.
philip
j.
shea
to
an
extent.
the
term
guidelines
mr.
justice
marshall
is
kind
of
confusing,
because
you
see
the
district
court
by
its
decree
of
may
19,
1970
filed
an
opinion
in
the
thing
which
set
guidelines
which
are
very
enlightened,
set
them
for
the
legislature,
but
refused
to
order,
to
make
any
specific
order
as
to
what
would
happen,
as
to
what
should
happen.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
exactly,
mr.
justice
black,
exactly.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
yes,
i
think
that
--
mr.
philip
j.
shea
if
the
court
made
one,
then
the
legislature
could
only
get
its
plan
approved
if
it
enacted
one
just
as
good
or
better
and
it
would
do
so.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
i
don’t
--
yes,
i
think
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
i
think
that
mr.
justice
white
really
on
the
basis
of
experience
again
that
these
nice
decisions
are
going
to
be
made
by
the
legislature
when
the
next
legislature
--
right
after
a
properly,
a
legislature
is
elected
on
the
basis
of
a
properly
apportioned
plan.
you’re
not
going
to
have
a
nice
constitutional
plan
come
out
of
a
terribly
malapportioned
legislature.
i
don’t
think
it’s
going
to
be
before
--
until
after
the
election
of
1972,
that
we
get
a
legislative
plan
that
cuts
the
mustard,
and
then
only
if
we
have
reapportionment
before
1972,
that’s
all
your
honor.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
i’d
like
to
respond
briefly
if
i
may
to
a
couple
of
points.
the
first
one
is
critically
important
and
that
is
the
availability
of
the
figures
because
that
has
so
much
to
do
with
the
timing
and
say
that
we
now
have
the
population
70
--
population
figures
by
county.
well,
that
is
to
say
that
the
1970
population
figures
by
county
is
published
in
a
little
pamphlet
that
you
buy
for
35
cents,
it
doesn’t
mean
it's
the
only
figures
available.
it
said
that
this
summer,
and
possibly
in
june
the
other
figures,
the
more
complete
figures
which
we
all
agree
are
necessary,
the
census
track
figures
are
available
in
tapes.
well,
you
can
call
this
number
here
of
the
u.s
census
bureau
in
washington,
d.c
and
they’ll
say
well,
we
don’t
have
them
on
tapes
and
we
don’t
have
them
on
a
brochure
that
costs
35
cents.
but,
they
are
there,
you
see,
they
are
there
if
anybody
has
the
will
to
find
them,
to
dig
them
out
to
do
these
things.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
i
don’t
know
if
there
is
any
process
of
informatory
certification
at
any
stage.
all
i
am
saying
is
they’re
available.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
i
don’t
know.
i
frankly
don’t
know
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
well,
i
don’t
know
if
they’re
officially
certified,
and
then
between
perhaps
now
and
if
they
have
not
been
but
--
mr.
philip
j.
shea
i’d
get
them
from
the
united
states
department,
the
bureau,
the
census
in
washington,
d.c.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
i
am
frankly
not
familiar
with
the
process
of
the
certification
of
figures.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
mr.
mcgowan
and
i
are
in
complete
disagreement
on
that.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
because
my
experience
is
that
a
legislature
does
not
reapportion
itself,
so
as
to
disseminate
its
leadership
and
that’s
what's
going
to
have
to
happen.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
yes,
they
did.
now
that
those
new
set
of
figures
are
going
to
have
to
disappear,
because
they
all
can’t
get
returned
if
the
right
thing
is
done.
that’s
the
problem
with
going
--
of
temperizing
with
unconstitutional
plans.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
no.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
yes.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
although
i
take
his
word
for,
in
other
words,
their
leaders
set
around
in
a
room
and
they
say
well,
you
know
the
court
said
by
november
1
--
mr.
philip
j.
shea
no,
he
says
that
they
intend
to
act
before
november
1,
1971
because
they
regarded
it
some
kind
of
a
moral
time
limit.[attempt
to
laughter]
mr.
philip
j.
shea
right,
and
that’s
what
i
dispute
too.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
no,
i
don’t
sir.
no.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
well,
he
makes
the
statement
in
all
good
faith
and
he’s
a
man
who
is
close
to
the
leadership
and
i
am
sure
he
is
accurately
reporting
what
he
advices
them
what
they
say
they
will
do.
i
have
no
doubt
that
they’ll
get
some
figures
and
go
into
a
special
session
though
i
have
every
doubt
in
the
world
that
they
are
going
to,
as
i
said,
decimate
their
leadership.
mr.
philip
j.
shea
we’re
going
to
go
back
to
court,
i
have
no
doubt
about
that.
we
go
back
to
court,
it
will
be
1972,
and
then
they’ll
say
it’s
too
late
to
appeal
again
and
then
nine
years
ill
pass.
so
i
think
that
what
we'd
like
to
do
is
have
it
straighten
out
now.
