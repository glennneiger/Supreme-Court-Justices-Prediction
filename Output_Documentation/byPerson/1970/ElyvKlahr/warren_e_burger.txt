you
press

e.

what
you
say
mr.
shea,
i
gather
yo
do
not
share
mr.
mcgowan’s
optimism
at
all
on
the
changes
that
have
occurred
in
the
legislature
up
to
now
and
their
likelihood
to
accomplish
this
objective
in
the
special
session
which
he
assures
us
will
be
held.
you
don’t
share
that
feeling.

but
the
last
reapportionment
created
a
new
leadership
as
justice
harlan
suggested,
a
new
set
of
interest
has
come
into
being.
do
you
agree
with
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don’t
think
the
polite
but
rather
clear
suggestion
on
the
three-judge
court
is
going
to
have
any
impact
on
the
legislature?
chief

warren
e.

it’s
true
that
the
court
did
not
order
that
the
states
obviously,
according
to
mr.
mcgowan’s
representation,
has
treated
the
court’s
polite
suggestion
as
though
it
had
done
an
order,
a
mandate?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
he
also
ties
that
time
under
the
availability
of
the
figures,
does
he
not.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
was
certainly,
i
do
not
read
this
as
a
dilatory
action,
but
as
a
representation
made
to
this
court
by
responsible
counsel,
that
these
figures
will
be
available
by
june
perhaps,
but
within
60
days
thereafter
and
that
the
legislature
will
be
in
a
special
session.
do
you
challenge
that?
