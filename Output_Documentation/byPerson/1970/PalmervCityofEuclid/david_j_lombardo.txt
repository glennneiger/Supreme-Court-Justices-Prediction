mr.
david
j.
lombardo
mr.
chief
justice
please
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
saying
that
bad
facts
make
bad
law
would
not
apply
in
this
case
and
i
think
we
would
both
agree
and
my
adversary
and
myself
that
whatever
the
outcome
of
this
hearing
that
the
fact
issue,
the
fact
situation
in
this
case
is
the
classic
case
of
suspicious
person
arrest.
mr.
david
j.
lombardo
arrest
under
this
ordinance.
i
think
this
is
the
type
of
activity
that
was
intended
by
the
legislation
to
be
prohibited.
so
we
can't
argue
that
facts
are
bad.
again,
we’ve
got
to
take
in
to
consideration
what
the
facts
are,
the
time
or
the
morning,
2:30
in
the
morning.
you
have
a
large
apartment
complex
where
the
police
officer
did
testify
there
had
been
burglaries,
larcenies
and
break-ins,
numerous.
we’ve
got
an
automobile
without
lights
moving
very
slowly.
you
have
an
automobile
discharging
a
woman
that
the
policeman
knows
not
to
be
a
tenant
there.
the
fact
she
was
colored
as
used
only
for
identification,
i’ll
talk
more
about
that
later.
mr.
david
j.
lombardo
she
could
have
been
because
she
wasn’t
a
resident
there.
mr.
david
j.
lombardo
she
was
a
visitor.
mr.
david
j.
lombardo
she
was
a
visitor.
i
don’t
argue
that.
but
we
knew
she
wasn’t
a
resident.
mr.
david
j.
lombardo
because
there
were
no
colored
residents
in
that
apartment
at
that
time.
mr.
david
j.
lombardo
yes
sir,
that’s
what
he
so
testified
too.
mr.
david
j.
lombardo
i
think
there’s
approximately
1500.
mr.
david
j.
lombardo
no
way.
now,
since
you
raised
that
point,
we’ll
skip
through
it
now.
yeah,
we
have
an
argument
in
the
appellant’s
brief
that
this
is
a
racial
type
thing
that
it
was
brought
up
in
his
argument.
i
think
it
would
be
further
from
the
truth.
the
only
mention
of
race
in
this
entire
trial
or
this
entire
proceeding
from
a
lower
court
to
here
was
when
the
police
officer
said--
mr.
david
j.
lombardo
that’s
right.
this
is
one
of
the
things
he
saw.
now,
suppose
i
had
said,
or
the
policeman
had
testified
that
a
one
arm
woman
got
out
of
the
car
and
there
were
one
arm
woman
in
the
apartment,
would
then
be
discriminated
against
one
arm
women.
of
course
not,
we
can’t
--
you
know
being
black
is
a
fact
and
a
being
yellow
is
a
fact
that
being
italian
was
a
fact.
mr.
david
j.
lombardo
no,
all
i’m
saying
is
that
when
a
police
man
sees
someone
at
night,
when
anyone
does
for
a
short
period
of
time,
race
is
sometime
no
matter
what
the
race,
the
most
obvious
thing
about
the
person.
it’s
similar
to
say,
i
saw
a
colored
man
or
i
saw
a
chinese
man
or
i
saw
indian,
it
doesn’t
mean
there’s
discrimination.
not
only
that,
but
we’ve
got
to
look
the
entire
proceedings.
now,
my
as
my
adversary
said
the
appellant
is
not
an
attorney.
he
represented
himself.
they
did
a
marvelous
job
in
the
trial
and
i
think
it’s
obvious
from
the
record
of
the
trial
that
he
was
given
much
more
latitude
in
the
trial
than
any
attorney
would
have
been.
i
think
he
was
treated
fairly
and
justly
and
properly
all
the
way
through
this
thing.
all
i’m
saying
that
in
this
case,
race
is
a
valid
thing
to
bring
up
only
as
to
identification
of
the
person.
that’s
all.
all
right,
further
getting
back
to
the
original
of
the
fact
situation.
the
driver
then
stopped
his
car
and
after
he
pulled
out
to
the
parking
lot,
put
his
license
and
communicated
on
a
two-way
radio
which
the
policeman
testified
the
modern
day
criminal
is
using
more
and
more
in
this
criminal
activities.
now
at
this
point,
the
police
officer
would
have
been
nothing
short
of
remise
had
he
not
proceeded
further
to
interrogate
the
appellant.
there’s
no
question
that
he
was
proper
in
going
forward
as
to
ascertain
just
what
he
was
doing
there.
the
appellant
then
refused
to
give
an
explanation
of
what
he
was
doing
there.
now,
we
hear
arguments
that
we
cannot
leave
the
determination
of
what
is
reasonable
and
proper
to
the
police
officer.
we
must
leave
it
to
the
police
officer.
uniform
patrol
man
is
our
first
line
of
defense.
if
he
cannot
be
trusted
to
make
a
judgment
on
the
street
then
why
they
are
having
policeman.
mr.
david
j.
lombardo
yes,
he
was
in
uniform
your
honor.
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
j.
lombardo
he
was
on
private
duty,
but
he
was
in
uniform.
mr.
david
j.
lombardo
no,
but
i
believe
that
the
police
officer
is
a
police
officer
24
hours
a
day
as
to
those
crimes
involved
in
the
breech
of
the
peace.
mr.
david
j.
lombardo
yes
your
honor.
mr.
david
j.
lombardo
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
j.
lombardo
at
that
time
it
was.
all
right,
now
the
argument
that
we’re
asking
you
to
extend
terry
in
the
same
fact
situation
from
the
right
to
fact
down
to
making
arrest,
i
can’t
argue
with
because
that’s
exactly
what
we’re
asking
you
to
do.
because
in
the
terry
case,
the
fact
situation
would
have
been
the
same,
officer
mcfaden
in
that
case
approached
terry
and
terry
had
not
been
able
to
give
an
explanation
of
what
he
was
doing
there.
then
under
this
ordinance,
he
could
have
arrested
him.
i’m
not
going
to
stand
here
and
tell
you
that
there
is
difference
because
there
isn’t.
we’re
asking
you
to
extend
terry
very
simply.
now,
this
court
has
often
said
that
it’s
not
so
much
the
wording
of
an
ordinance
was
determined
whether
or
not
its
constitutional,
but
the
action
that
it
allows.
the
conduct
that
authorizes.
again,
let’s
go
back
to
this
fact
situation.
you
got
a
policeman
who
observed
some
activity
that
might
make
him
believe
that
criminal
activity
was
a
foot.
he
had
the
right
to
further
investigation.
to
uphold
the
constitutionality,
this
ordinance
would
not
be
an
open
door
to
police
abuse.
i
still
think
that
any
--before
any
conviction
could
stand
under
this
ordinance,
the
standard
set
out
in
terry
would
have
to
be
applied
to
them.
in
other
words,
you
cannot
just
see
a
man
walking
down
the
street
and
immediately
say
what
are
you
doing
here
and
you
expect
an
explanation.
this
isn’t
it.
the
policeman
inquired
as
he
did
in
this
case
would
have
to
point
to
you
specific
articulable
facts.
and
say,
i
saw
this,
this,
and
this.
therefore,
my
suspicions
were
aroused,
i
proceeded
further.
mr.
david
j.
lombardo
no,
i
understand
that.
mr.
david
j.
lombardo
yes
your
honor.
mr.
david
j.
lombardo
oh
i
agree
with
you.
mr.
david
j.
lombardo
so,
he
then
goes
forward
and
asks
the
suspect,
“what
are
you
going
here?”
if
the
man
refuses
or
is
unable
to
give
a
satisfactory
account
of
himself
to
the
policeman
and
is
against
the
policeman’s
judgment
at
this
time
as
i
think
it
must
be.
then
he’s
subject
to
arrest.
it’s
necessary
that
there’ll
be
a
combination
of
both
and
both
are
going
to
be
absolutely
necessary
for
conviction.
first,
you’ve
got
have
the
ascertainable
facts
that
the
policeman
observed
why
did
he
approach
in
the
first
place
and
then
the
refusal
or
inability
of
the
suspect.
now,
if
the
policeman
--
well,
strike
that.
we
do
not
feel
that
this
is
open
to
discriminatory
enforcement.
as
was
brought
up
earlier
in
the
case
prior
to
this,
if
the
policeman
is
going
to
discriminate,
he’s
going
to
discriminate
no
matter
what
the
law
is.
if
you
mention
traffic,
of
course
in
any
traffic
cases,
it’s
the
policeman’s
word
against
the
individual’s
word
and
the
judge
will
almost
always
believe
the
policeman.
we
have
courts
and
we
have
juries
and
this
is
what
this
is
for,
that’s
why
they
are
for.
i’m
going
to
be
very
brief
because
i
think
the
issue
is
clear.
you
get
down
again
to
the
old
argument,
the
individual’s
rights
against
society’s
rights.
you’ve
only
got
to
look
at
the
crime
rate
on
the
streets.
i
am
not
trying
to
but
it’s
true.
you
can’t
walk
down
the
street
in
this
town
or
most
other
big
cities.
we’ve
got
to
give
the
policeman
under
beat.
that’s
your
first
and
sometime
your
line
is
defense.
you’ve
got
to
give
him
the
power
to
combat
back
this.
merely
patting
someone
down
as
like
in
the
terry
case
i
believe
it
was.
they
said,
“well,
if
he
doesn’t
find
anything
after
path,
then
maybe
he
should
watch
him
a
little
bit
longer.”
that’s
not
the
answer.
a
pack
down
alone
is
not
going
to
be
enough.
i
think
in
arrest
for
a
misdemeanor
is
necessary.
mr.
david
j.
lombardo
30
seconds.
mr.
david
j.
lombardo
let
me
just
say
this,
in
terry
and
sibr
you
started
--
this
court
started
to
give
the
streets
back
to
the
people.
i
would
ask
you
in
this
case
to
take
the
next
step
and
give
them
back.
thank
you.
mr.
david
j.
lombardo
mr.
chief
justice
please
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
saying
that
bad
facts
make
bad
law
would
not
apply
in
this
case
and
i
think
we
would
both
agree
and
my
adversary
and
myself
that
whatever
the
outcome
of
this
hearing
that
the
fact
issue,
the
fact
situation
in
this
case
is
the
classic
case
of
suspicious
person
arrest.
mr.
david
j.
lombardo
arrest
under
this
ordinance.
i
think
this
is
the
type
of
activity
that
was
intended
by
the
legislation
to
be
prohibited.
so
we
can't
argue
that
facts
are
bad.
again,
we’ve
got
to
take
in
to
consideration
what
the
facts
are,
the
time
or
the
morning,
2:30
in
the
morning.
you
have
a
large
apartment
complex
where
the
police
officer
did
testify
there
had
been
burglaries,
larcenies
and
break-ins,
numerous.
we’ve
got
an
automobile
without
lights
moving
very
slowly.
you
have
an
automobile
discharging
a
woman
that
the
policeman
knows
not
to
be
a
tenant
there.
the
fact
she
was
colored
as
used
only
for
identification,
i’ll
talk
more
about
that
later.
mr.
david
j.
lombardo
she
could
have
been
because
she
wasn’t
a
resident
there.
mr.
david
j.
lombardo
she
was
a
visitor.
mr.
david
j.
lombardo
she
was
a
visitor.
i
don’t
argue
that.
but
we
knew
she
wasn’t
a
resident.
mr.
david
j.
lombardo
because
there
were
no
colored
residents
in
that
apartment
at
that
time.
mr.
david
j.
lombardo
yes
sir,
that’s
what
he
so
testified
too.
mr.
david
j.
lombardo
i
think
there’s
approximately
1500.
mr.
david
j.
lombardo
no
way.
now,
since
you
raised
that
point,
we’ll
skip
through
it
now.
yeah,
we
have
an
argument
in
the
appellant’s
brief
that
this
is
a
racial
type
thing
that
it
was
brought
up
in
his
argument.
i
think
it
would
be
further
from
the
truth.
the
only
mention
of
race
in
this
entire
trial
or
this
entire
proceeding
from
a
lower
court
to
here
was
when
the
police
officer
said--
mr.
david
j.
lombardo
that’s
right.
this
is
one
of
the
things
he
saw.
now,
suppose
i
had
said,
or
the
policeman
had
testified
that
a
one
arm
woman
got
out
of
the
car
and
there
were
one
arm
woman
in
the
apartment,
would
then
be
discriminated
against
one
arm
women.
of
course
not,
we
can’t
--
you
know
being
black
is
a
fact
and
a
being
yellow
is
a
fact
that
being
italian
was
a
fact.
mr.
david
j.
lombardo
no,
all
i’m
saying
is
that
when
a
police
man
sees
someone
at
night,
when
anyone
does
for
a
short
period
of
time,
race
is
sometime
no
matter
what
the
race,
the
most
obvious
thing
about
the
person.
it’s
similar
to
say,
i
saw
a
colored
man
or
i
saw
a
chinese
man
or
i
saw
indian,
it
doesn’t
mean
there’s
discrimination.
not
only
that,
but
we’ve
got
to
look
the
entire
proceedings.
now,
my
as
my
adversary
said
the
appellant
is
not
an
attorney.
he
represented
himself.
they
did
a
marvelous
job
in
the
trial
and
i
think
it’s
obvious
from
the
record
of
the
trial
that
he
was
given
much
more
latitude
in
the
trial
than
any
attorney
would
have
been.
i
think
he
was
treated
fairly
and
justly
and
properly
all
the
way
through
this
thing.
all
i’m
saying
that
in
this
case,
race
is
a
valid
thing
to
bring
up
only
as
to
identification
of
the
person.
that’s
all.
all
right,
further
getting
back
to
the
original
of
the
fact
situation.
the
driver
then
stopped
his
car
and
after
he
pulled
out
to
the
parking
lot,
put
his
license
and
communicated
on
a
two-way
radio
which
the
policeman
testified
the
modern
day
criminal
is
using
more
and
more
in
this
criminal
activities.
now
at
this
point,
the
police
officer
would
have
been
nothing
short
of
remise
had
he
not
proceeded
further
to
interrogate
the
appellant.
there’s
no
question
that
he
was
proper
in
going
forward
as
to
ascertain
just
what
he
was
doing
there.
the
appellant
then
refused
to
give
an
explanation
of
what
he
was
doing
there.
now,
we
hear
arguments
that
we
cannot
leave
the
determination
of
what
is
reasonable
and
proper
to
the
police
officer.
we
must
leave
it
to
the
police
officer.
uniform
patrol
man
is
our
first
line
of
defense.
if
he
cannot
be
trusted
to
make
a
judgment
on
the
street
then
why
they
are
having
policeman.
mr.
david
j.
lombardo
yes,
he
was
in
uniform
your
honor.
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
j.
lombardo
he
was
on
private
duty,
but
he
was
in
uniform.
mr.
david
j.
lombardo
no,
but
i
believe
that
the
police
officer
is
a
police
officer
24
hours
a
day
as
to
those
crimes
involved
in
the
breech
of
the
peace.
mr.
david
j.
lombardo
yes
your
honor.
mr.
david
j.
lombardo
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
j.
lombardo
at
that
time
it
was.
all
right,
now
the
argument
that
we’re
asking
you
to
extend
terry
in
the
same
fact
situation
from
the
right
to
fact
down
to
making
arrest,
i
can’t
argue
with
because
that’s
exactly
what
we’re
asking
you
to
do.
because
in
the
terry
case,
the
fact
situation
would
have
been
the
same,
officer
mcfaden
in
that
case
approached
terry
and
terry
had
not
been
able
to
give
an
explanation
of
what
he
was
doing
there.
then
under
this
ordinance,
he
could
have
arrested
him.
i’m
not
going
to
stand
here
and
tell
you
that
there
is
difference
because
there
isn’t.
we’re
asking
you
to
extend
terry
very
simply.
now,
this
court
has
often
said
that
it’s
not
so
much
the
wording
of
an
ordinance
was
determined
whether
or
not
its
constitutional,
but
the
action
that
it
allows.
the
conduct
that
authorizes.
again,
let’s
go
back
to
this
fact
situation.
you
got
a
policeman
who
observed
some
activity
that
might
make
him
believe
that
criminal
activity
was
a
foot.
he
had
the
right
to
further
investigation.
to
uphold
the
constitutionality,
this
ordinance
would
not
be
an
open
door
to
police
abuse.
i
still
think
that
any
--before
any
conviction
could
stand
under
this
ordinance,
the
standard
set
out
in
terry
would
have
to
be
applied
to
them.
in
other
words,
you
cannot
just
see
a
man
walking
down
the
street
and
immediately
say
what
are
you
doing
here
and
you
expect
an
explanation.
this
isn’t
it.
the
policeman
inquired
as
he
did
in
this
case
would
have
to
point
to
you
specific
articulable
facts.
and
say,
i
saw
this,
this,
and
this.
therefore,
my
suspicions
were
aroused,
i
proceeded
further.
mr.
david
j.
lombardo
no,
i
understand
that.
mr.
david
j.
lombardo
yes
your
honor.
mr.
david
j.
lombardo
oh
i
agree
with
you.
mr.
david
j.
lombardo
so,
he
then
goes
forward
and
asks
the
suspect,
“what
are
you
going
here?”
if
the
man
refuses
or
is
unable
to
give
a
satisfactory
account
of
himself
to
the
policeman
and
is
against
the
policeman’s
judgment
at
this
time
as
i
think
it
must
be.
then
he’s
subject
to
arrest.
it’s
necessary
that
there’ll
be
a
combination
of
both
and
both
are
going
to
be
absolutely
necessary
for
conviction.
first,
you’ve
got
have
the
ascertainable
facts
that
the
policeman
observed
why
did
he
approach
in
the
first
place
and
then
the
refusal
or
inability
of
the
suspect.
now,
if
the
policeman
--
well,
strike
that.
we
do
not
feel
that
this
is
open
to
discriminatory
enforcement.
as
was
brought
up
earlier
in
the
case
prior
to
this,
if
the
policeman
is
going
to
discriminate,
he’s
going
to
discriminate
no
matter
what
the
law
is.
if
you
mention
traffic,
of
course
in
any
traffic
cases,
it’s
the
policeman’s
word
against
the
individual’s
word
and
the
judge
will
almost
always
believe
the
policeman.
we
have
courts
and
we
have
juries
and
this
is
what
this
is
for,
that’s
why
they
are
for.
i’m
going
to
be
very
brief
because
i
think
the
issue
is
clear.
you
get
down
again
to
the
old
argument,
the
individual’s
rights
against
society’s
rights.
you’ve
only
got
to
look
at
the
crime
rate
on
the
streets.
i
am
not
trying
to
but
it’s
true.
you
can’t
walk
down
the
street
in
this
town
or
most
other
big
cities.
we’ve
got
to
give
the
policeman
under
beat.
that’s
your
first
and
sometime
your
line
is
defense.
you’ve
got
to
give
him
the
power
to
combat
back
this.
merely
patting
someone
down
as
like
in
the
terry
case
i
believe
it
was.
they
said,
“well,
if
he
doesn’t
find
anything
after
path,
then
maybe
he
should
watch
him
a
little
bit
longer.”
that’s
not
the
answer.
a
pack
down
alone
is
not
going
to
be
enough.
i
think
in
arrest
for
a
misdemeanor
is
necessary.
mr.
david
j.
lombardo
30
seconds.
mr.
david
j.
lombardo
let
me
just
say
this,
in
terry
and
sibr
you
started
--
this
court
started
to
give
the
streets
back
to
the
people.
i
would
ask
you
in
this
case
to
take
the
next
step
and
give
them
back.
thank
you.
