justice
potter
stewart
does
the
record
show
whether
there
have
been
any
burglary
incidents
in
the
area
in
the
immediate
past.
justice
potter
stewart
your
client
represented
himself
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
he
a
lawyer?
justice
potter
stewart
the
defendant.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
companion
female,
companion
ever
found
or
identified?
justice
potter
stewart
just
they
asked
those
two
bachelors
whether
she
was
there
and
he
said
no
is
that
it.
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
satisfied
with
the
answer,
what
if
they
say
they
went
away?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
ordinance
says
they
can’t
found
on
the
street
without
--
justice
potter
stewart
or
lawful
business,
how
does
the
state
satisfy
its
burden
of
showing
somebody’s
on
the
street
without
lawful
business?
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
know,
but
that
just
means
lawful
business.
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
it
doesn’t
mean
visible
and
lawful,
it
says
visible
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
the
state
can
certainly
say
there
wasn’t
any
thing
visible
about
--
he
had
no
business
that
was
visible
any.
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
lawful.
how
about
lawful?
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
know
that--
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
think
a
state
--
our
city
could
have
a
--
could
a
city
have
an
ordinance
establishing
a
curfew
saying
no
one
should
be
on
the
streets
after
2
am,
except
who
were
going
to
or
from
employment
or
going
to
or
from
a
doctor
hospital.
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
your
answer
were
to
the
contrary
that
the
city
could
have
that?
do
you
think
that
has
any
bearing
on
your
case?
justice
potter
stewart
of
what?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
in
fact
that
she
was
apparent.
justice
potter
stewart
and
whether
on
a
legal
or
illegal
business,
she
did
go
into
the
apartment.
justice
potter
stewart
and
was
this
the
arresting
officer?
justice
potter
stewart
and
was
he
--
he
was
officer
on
the
police
force
of
euclid.
justice
potter
stewart
at
euclid,
but
he
also
apparently
in
another
job
and
that
was
an
employee
of
this
apartment
house.
justice
potter
stewart
right?
justice
potter
stewart
in
which
job
was
he
performing
in
either
the
rest?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it
was
the
first
degree
murder
case
if
he
was
the
police
officer.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
carrying
out
his
duty.
justice
potter
stewart
no
i’m
sorry.
i
don’t
remember
that
case.
but
that’s
--
i
think
the
law
of
ohio
generally.
justice
potter
stewart
as
the
police
officer
as
the
police
officer
24
hours
a
day,
but
i
wonder
if
the
record
shows
what
his
hours
were
as
an
employee
of
the
police
department
of
euclid
and
what
his
hours
were
as
an
employee
of
this
apartment
house.
that’s
all
white
apartment
house
where
he
kept
negroes
out
of
it.
justice
potter
stewart
yes
and
which
was
he
that
night?
you
mean
getting
salaries
from
both
two
employers?
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
what
the
record
shows.
justice
potter
stewart
well
the
testimony,
i
don’t
have
it
right
here
but
i
--
rather
struck
me.
he
didn’t
refer
on
his
fellow
officers.
he
said,
he
called
the
euclid
police
department
as
my
department
as
my
fellow
officers.
i
don’t
have
it
here,
perhaps
i
have
misread
it.
