mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
the
constitutionality
of
section
583.01
(e)
of
the
ordinances
of
the
city
of
euclid,
ohio
which
makes
it
unlawful
for
any
suspicious
person
to
be
within
the
municipality
and
part
(e)
defining
suspicious
person
as
any
person
who
wanders
about
the
streets
or
other
public
ways
or
who
is
found
abroad
at
later
unusual
hours
in
the
night
without
any
visible
or
lawful
business
and
who
does
not
give
satisfactory
accounting
himself.
now,
this
question
arises
on
the
following
facts.
on
april
19,
1967,
an
off
duty
euclid
policeman
who
was
on
his
part
time
job
as
a
patrolman
or
watchman
at
a
very
large
apartment
complex
in
the
city
of
euclid
had
his
concern
alerted
by
noticing
a
car
driving
slowly
in
the
parking
lot
of
the
apartment
complex.
at
a
speed,
he
estimated
as
three
to
five
miles
an
hour
with
the
lights
off.
secondly,
he
testified
that
his
suspicion
was
aroused
by
the
fact
that
the
car
stopped
and
discharged
a
“colored
female”
and
he
knew
that
no
colored
female
lived
in
that
apartment
complex
and
this
aroused
his
suspicion.
the
third
thing,
he
testified
that
aroused
the
suspicion
was
that
after
discharging
the
female,
the
car,
which
was
ultimately
determined
to
be
driven
by
the
appellant
or
defendant
here,
james
palmer,
turned
on
its
lights,
pulled
down
to
the
street
and
parked.
upon
approaching
the
car,
the
officer
testified
that
he
noticed
the
appellant
speaking
over
a
citizen’s
band
or
two-way
radio.
as
a
result
of
these
three
things,
he
asked
palmer
to
get
out
of
the
car,
put
him
up
against
the
car,
demanded
his
license,
his
driver’s
license
which
was
furnished
and
asked
him
to
explain
what
he
was
doing
there.
he
explained
that
he
had
left,
discharged
the
friend,
further
inquiry
about
the
identity
and
purpose
of
the
friend
resulted
in
no
response.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
the
record
shows
that
following
the
unsatisfactory
response
as
far
as
the
officer
was
concerned,
he
marched
the
defendant
into
the
building
at
gun
point
called
for
assistance
from
the
police
department
and
a
search
was
conducted
of
the
entire
premises
and
the
girl
was
not
found.
subsequently,
the
defendant
finally
agreed
to
state
where
he
thought
that
the
girl
had
gone
to
specific
apartment
number.
they
went
up
to
that
apartment,
by
this
time
it
was
2:30
or
2:45
to
3:00
in
the
morning
and
knocked
on
the
door
at
that
apartment,
the
police
officer.
and
a
male
answered
the
door
and
was
asked,
“is
there
a
colored
female
in
the
premises?”
and
upon
being
informed
that
the
answer
was
no
that
officers
left
continuing
to
search
on
the
premises
for
the
girl.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
the
record
shows
that
there
were
no
reports
of
any
incident
of
any
kind
that
there
was
--
not
ever
any
report
of
any
crime
having
been
committed
that
night.
now,
after
palmer
was
stopped,
frisked,
detained,
arrested,
searched,
taken
to
the
police
station,
interrogated,
stolen
car
sheet
checked,
it
was
determined
that
absolutely
no
substantive
offense
had
ever
occurred
and
that
there
was
not
a
(inaudible)
of
evidence
of
any
having
ever
occurred.
and
subsequently,
palmer
was
charged
with
being
a
suspicious
person
in
violation
of
this
section.
now
at
first
blush
perhaps,
this
case
seems
to
be
another
in
the
line
of
cases,
testing
police
investigatory
power
versus
individual
liberty,
many
of
which
incredibly
arise
out
of
the
cleveland
area,
mapp
versus
ohio,
beck
versus
ohio,
and
terry
versus
ohio.
but
there’s
one
crucial
difference
in
this
case.
in
those
cases,
the
issue
was
shall
a
concededly
guilty
man
go
for
woman,
go
free
in
order
to
serve
some
interest
of
constitutional
liberty.
here,
the
issue
is
shall
an
innocent
man
be
convicted
and
incarcerated
in
order
to
serve
some
putative
interest
in
law
enforcement
or
maintenance
of
order.
and
i’m
prepared
to
demonstrate
that
this
ordinance
on
its
face
and
as
applied
does
great
violence
to
hover
constitutional
rights
and
with
no
justification
in
necessity
of
law
enforcement
for
maintenance
of
order.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
the
man
was
sentenced
to
pay
$50.00
fine
in
cost
and
to
serve
30
days
in
the
cuyahoga
county
jail.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
no
by
order
of
--
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
by
order
of
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
service
is
sentenced
has
been
stayed
and
originally
pending
the
filing
of
the
jurisdictional
statement
and
now
appending
the
outcome
of
the
case.
there
are
three
fundamental
attacks
on
this
ordinance,
on
its
face
and
as
applied
and
time
perhaps
will
not
permit
me
to
deal
with
all
of
them
as
fully
as
i
might
wish.
the
first
is
vagueness.
the
rule
of
void
for
vagueness
serves
three
primary
interests,
that
a
furnishing
notice
to
those
who
wished
to
confirm
their
behavior
to
law
so
they
might
know
what
they
may
do
and
what
they
may
not.
limit
the
second
purpose
is
limiting
the
discretion
of
law
enforcement
officers
of
courts
and
juries
within
some
described
standards
in
order
to
prevent
arbitrary
and
discriminatory
enforcement
and
the
third
is
to
prevent
the
ordinance
from
being
construed
too
broadly
to
encompass
or
trench
upon
constitutional
protected
conduct.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
like
what
in
this
particular
instance?
frequently,
the
document
presents
a
self
most
often
in
terms
of
first
amendment
activity.
in
this
particular
instance,
the
constitutionally
protected
conduct
involved
is
the
right
to
liberty
without
--
except
upon
articulable
suspicion
or
articulable
facts
that
the
constitute
in
effect
reasonable
suspicion
under
terry
to
justify
a
stop
and
frisk,
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
crime
has
been
or
is
being
committed
in
order
to
justify
an
arrest
and
proof
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
that
a
crime
has
been
committed
in
order
to
justify
a
conviction
and
incarceration
pursuant
to
that
conviction.
and
so
there’s
liberty
of
movement
here
or
the
freedom
of
movement
which
is
one
of
the
--
of
the
constitutionally
protected
interest
involve.
they’re
constitutionally
protect
interest
of
the
right
to
be
free
of
discriminatory
enforcement
and
these
interests
are
served.
these
purposes
are
served
by
the
vagueness
doctrine.
now
usually
when
a
case
comes
here
on
the
issue
of
vagueness,
the
whole
case
turns
on
--
meaning
the
single
word
or
phrase
as
we
just
saw
in
the
last
case,
the
real
questions,
what
is
annoying
me
and
is
that
sufficiently
precise.
here,
we’d
got
four
or
five
phrases
which
individually
each
is
vague
together,
they’re
impossible.
wanders,
what
is
wanders?
what
does
that
mean?
we
see
in
judicial
opinions,
there
are
at
least
three
competing
interpretations
of
wander.
in
the
ohio
supreme
court
decision
of
columbus
versus
delong,
you
have
the
majority
striking
down
the
statute
on
the
ground
that
wander,
by
virtue
of
being
defined
as
aimless
motion
without
any
purpose
cannot
include
a
criminal
purpose,
therefore
it’s
limited
to
innocent
conduct
and
therefore
the
ordinance
was
held
unconstitutional.
on
the
other
hand,
the
dissent
says
that
within
the
context
that
wander
must
necessarily
mean
or
be
limited
to
a
criminal
purpose
wandering
for
a
criminal
cases
or
a
wrongful
purpose
and
therefore
the
ordinance
should
be
upheld.
in
seattle
versus
drew
the
court
struck
down
a
similar
ordinance
because
they
said
wander
can
mean
either
innocent
or
culpable
conduct
and
in
that
sense,
in
being
too
vague
is
too
broad
as
well.
a
broad
at
later
unusual
hours
in
the
night
with
that
visible
or
lawful
business
is
as
simply
seems
to
me
a
night
time
version
of
wandering
and
without
visible
or
lawful
business
begs
the
question
as
to
what
it
is
that’s
prohibited
and
what
it
is
that’s
protected.
is
professional
ricks
walking
the
streets
at
midnight,
visible
or
lawful
business?
when
he
has
no
defined
purpose,
were
not
answered.
then
of
course
we
come
to
the
most
incredibly
vague
of
all
phrases
and
the
one
that
renders
the
ordinance
most
effective
in
my
opinion,
does
not
give
a
satisfactory
accounting
himself.
satisfactory
account
to
whom,
whom
may
demand
it.
who
must
be
satisfied?
over
what
period
of
time
must
they
be
satisfied?
it’s
a
credible,
but
untrue
account
satisfactory.
is
it
true
but
incredible
account
satisfactory?
it’s
purely
subjective
and
purely
just
throws
open
the
door
to
the
police
officer
in
the
first
instance.
the
judge
and/or
jury
in
the
second
instance
to
decide
whether
it’s
satisfactory
and
even
to
decide
who
must
be
satisfied,
is
the
issue
at
trial,
whether
the
officer
was
satisfied
or
is
the
issue
whether
judge
and
jury
are
satisfied?
now,
the
same
principles,
the
same
defects
in
here
in
discussing
this
in
terms
of
its
propensity
for
arbitrary
and
discriminatory
enforcement,
ordinarily
a
statute
which
is
inordinately
vague
simply
by
virtue
of
its
vagueness
facilitates
arbitrary
or
discriminatory
enforcement.
but
here,
explicitly
it
authorizes
arbitrary
or
subjective
enforcement.
what
the
court
has
previously
described
in
other
cases
as
government
by
moment
to
moment
opinion
of
the
police
officer
on
the
beat.
the
law
as
its
drafted
on
its
face
can’t
possibly
be
indiscriminately
enforced
across
the
board.
it’s
inconceivable
that
that
could
be
done.
the
law
review
literature
is
replete
with
discriminatory
enforcement
of
these
kinds
of
ordinances
against
hippies,
yippies
beatniks,
bums,
people
of
unconventional
dress,
behavior,
length
of
hair
and
so
on
and
against
black
--
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
well,
ohio
has
exactly
such
speed
laws
and
of
course
any
law
could
be
subjected
to
discriminatory
enforcement
in
the
sense
of
arresting
and
prosecution
and
so
on.
on
the
other
hand,
dealing
with
the
question
of
was
the
speed
reasonable
under
the
circumstances.
there
are
objective
indicia
that
one
can
look
at
to
determine
reasonableness.
for
example,
how
many
cars
were
on
the
highway?
what
were
the
weather
conditions?
what
was
the
width
to
the
highway?
how
much
access
was
there
on
the
side,
the
traffic
lights?
so
and
all
of
these
things
are
objective
indicia
that
one
can
look
at
to
determine
reasonableness.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
more
often
than
not
that
is
the
case.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
that’s
right.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
i
can
see,
any
lose
susceptible
for
abuse.
the
question
is
--
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
well,
it’s
enormously
different
in
degree
if
not
in
kind
your
honor
in
terms
of
the
propensity
of
the
language
to
facilitate
this
kind
of
thing.
we
don’t
have
to
speculate
on
the
capacity
for
arbitrary
enforcement
here
by,
reading
by
the
terms
of
the
other
cases
or
large
articles.
we
have
right
in
this
very
case,
an
example
of
race
being
used
as
a
factor.
in
fact,
i
would
argue
that
race
is
really
almost
an
element
of
the
offense
here
because
this
is
one
of
the
key
factors
and
why
the
officer
testified
that
his
suspicion
was
aroused.
in
other
words,
this
is
a
black
person
in
a
white
neighborhood
at
night
and
he
shouldn’t
be
there.
he’s
automatically
suspicious
by
reason
of
being
there.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
yes,
he
did.
he
tried
the
case
himself
and
he
handled
the
appeals
the
way
through
the
ohio
supreme
court.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
no
he’s
not.
all
right,
i
confess
this
from
reading
the
record,
it’s
a
fair
question
whether
or
not
he
is.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
the
remarkable
judge
for
a
laymen.
this
is
the
first
thing
that
struck
me
upon
reading
the
record
when
he
came
to
me.
but
to
talk
about
vagueness
--
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
no.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
that’s
exactly.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
they
took
their
word
for
it.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
no
they
didn’t,
although
they
could
conceivably
have
stationed
one
officer
at
the
door
and
sent
the
other
out
for
search
warrant.
but
the
talk
about
vagueness
here,
while
the
vagueness
evils
are
egregious,
it’s
the
least
of
the
evils
because
vagueness
is
subject
to,
it’s
suggested
drafting
problem.
subject
to
being
cured
by
greater
precision
in
drafting,
but
assume
that
you
could
get
over
all
the
vagueness
hurdles
by
converting
this
into
more
precise
language,
you
still
have
an
ordinance
which
fundamental
purpose
is
right,
because
it
punishes
the
arousing
of
suspicion
and
the
failure
or
refusal
to
dispel
that
suspicion.
and
that
flies
in
the
face
number
of
important
constitutional
principles.
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
it
permits
various
levels
of
deprivation
of
liberty
--
permits
the
ultimate
deprivation
of
liberty,
conviction
and
imprisonment
on
facts
that
may
not
even
be
sufficient
to
justify
a
stop
and
frisk
under
terry.
we
don’t
have
to
decide
whether
it
was
sufficient
to
justify
a
stop
and
frisk
under
terry.
we
don’t
have
to
decide
whether
it
was
sufficient
to
justify
an
arrest
under
beck.
what
we
have
to
decide
is,
was
there
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
criminal
activity
that
justifies
the
conviction.
and
in
addition
to
subverting
these
standards
constitutional
derived
standards
of
proof
for
stop
and
frisk,
arrest
and
conviction,
the
burden
of
proof
by
reason
of
the
satisfactory
account
clause
is
thrust
on
the
defendant.
he’s
got
to
be
able
to
explain
away
all
of
the
ambiguities
or
suspicions
of
his
behavior.
as
far
as
the
satisfactory
account
clause,
it
also
has
the
defect
of
compelling
a
violation
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
i
would
rely
primarily
on
the
brief
on
that
point.
i
will
like
to
deal
with
the
citation
of
the
appellee
to
the
miranda
case
here.
this
is
not
a
miranda
case.
the
issue
here
is
not
whether
or
not
statements
given
by
the
defendant
were
sufficient
advice
and
sufficient
knowledge
of
its
rights
to
be
able
to
be
introduced
into
evidence.
the
issue
rather
is
whether
or
not
the
city
of
euclid,
multitude
and
as
other
city
similarly
situated,
can
compel
by
threat
of
60
days
imprisonment
which
is
the
statutory
maximum,
although
the
defendant
here
was
only
sentenced
to
30
days
can
compel
him
to
face
the
choice
of
either
going
to
jail
as
a
suspicious
person
for
failing
to
give
a
satisfactory
accounting
himself
or
conversely
giving
up
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
incriminating
himself.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
that’s
a
good
question
which
i
have
an
impossible
time
answering
because
the
thing
is
so
vague.
i
assumed
that
in
the
euclid
municipal
court
one
can
get
a
conviction
of
those
facts.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
visible
or
lawful
business.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
without
visible
or
lawful
business.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
i
don’t
know
how
we
can
just
read
visible
out
of
it.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
or
lawful.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
that’s
right.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
well,
you
see
if
the
visible
weren’t
in
there
and
the
state
had
the
burden
of
showing
that
he
was
engaging
an
unlawful
conduct,
it
would
be
a
vastly
different
ordinance
--
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
but
they
take
the
visible
are
lawful
to
mean
that
it’s
the
burden
is
on
the
defendant.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
to
demonstrate,
--
to
manifest
his
purpose
on
the
street.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
well,
i
read
the
states
case
here
as
consisting
of
the
fact
that
--
well
the
officer
testified
--
the
officer
testified
that
no
law
that
he
knows
off
was
broken
including
the
minuet
parking,
driving,
traffic
and
so.
there’s
no
law
to
his
knowledge
broken.
now,
where
is
the
unlawful
activity?
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
in
the
parking
lot,
he
turned
on
his
lights
before
he
pulled
on
the
street
and
then
on
the
private
parking
lot,
it
was
not
an
offense
to
drive
without
light.
the
officer
testified
it’s
in
the
record.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
that
he
was
not
trespassing
either?
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
he
was
bringing
--
he
was
bringing
a
person
to
the
apartment.
now,
we
don’t
know
for
what
purpose
he
brought
that
person
to
the
apartment.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
no,
no.
he
gave
the
explanation.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
that
he
had
come
--
that
he
had
brought
the
friend
to
the
apartment.
now,
what
he
did
not
explain
was
who
the
friend
was
and
what
the
friend’s
purpose
was.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
could
disbelieve
him
on
bringing
--
the
fact
that
he
was
bringing
the
girl.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
certainly,
certainly
they
disbelieved
him.
he
didn’t
testify
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
at
the
trial
--
when
i
relate
what
he
said,
i’m
talking
about
the
officer’s
testimony
as
to
what
he
is
alleged
to
have
said
on
the
premises
at
the
time
that
the
violation
occurred.
now,
as
to
trespass,
i
don’t
know
any
facts
that
would
render
this
a
trespass
in
a
sense
that
this
is
an
enormous
apartment
complex
in
which
kind
of
quasi-public,
private
parking
lot.
when
i
say
private,
i
mean
it’s
not
a
dedicated
thoroughfare
such
that
the
traffic
laws
requiring
lights
at
night
are
applicable.
it’s
quasi-public
in
the
sense
that
it’s
an
enormous
parking
lot
for
the
use
of
residents
and
visitors
as
well.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
as
far
as
the
law
is
requiring
one
to
have
lights
on
his
car
at
night
is
concerned,
yes.
that’s
the
officer’s
testimony
in
the
record.
it’s
not
my
interpretation.
now,
having
briefly
demonstrated,
the
constitutional
defects
with
this
ordinance,
both
on
its
face
and
as
applied
here,
question
arises,
is
there
any
necessity
in
the
demands
or
needs
of
order
of
law
enforcement
to
justify
these
infringements.
if
there
ever
was
a
need
for
this
kind
of
a
law,
it’s
been
dissipated.
the
argument
for
this
kind
of
a
law
historically
has
been
--
fourth
amendment
concepts
of
probable
cause
have
been
inadequate
to
allow
the
police
to
engage
in
pre-probable
investigation
and
inquiry.
this
court
i
think
by
its
decision
in
the
terry
case
has
taken
the
question
of
police
right
to
inquire
and
to
investigate
prior
to
probable
cause
on
a
plain
in
which
penalized
by
itself.
it
doesn’t
have
to
be
attached
to
subsequent
charge
of
a
substantive
offense
and
there
are
a
host
of
--
lot
of
questions
unresolved
by
terry
which
don’t
have
to
be
resolved
here,
but
without
passing
on
the
constitutionality,
many
of
these
alternatives
such
alternatives
as
the
american
law
institutes
model
code
of
prearraignment
procedure,
the
uniform
arrest
act,
the
new
york
stop
and
frisk
law,
the
common
law
authority
recognizing
terry
versus
ohio
in
the
state
version
of
the
case
all
of
these
alternatives
are
available
to
the
city
of
euclid,
to
the
state
of
ohio,
to
law
enforcement
officers
are
possibly
available
to
them.
obviating
the
necessity
for
making
a
substantive
offense
out
of
what
is
merely
cause
to
investigate.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
no,
i
don’t
think
so.
i
think
that’s
too
large
in
infringement
on
freedom
of
movement
without
some
particularized
compelling
necessity
in
the
circumstances.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
well,
if
my
answer
were
that
the
city
could
have
that,
then
certain
portions
of
my
argument
about
the
defects
of
this
ordinance
would
be
eliminated.
those
that
would
not
would
be
the
complaints
about
vagueness
and
the
complaints
about
compelling
violation
of
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
with
the
woman’s
what?
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
oh
certainly
could
ask
him.
no
question
about
it.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
i’m
not
objecting
to
the
officer
asking
questions.
i’m
objecting
to
the
fact
that
after
all
the
questions
are
asked
and
all
the
searches
and
frisks
and
interrogations
are
conducted,
there’s
no
evidence
of
a
crime
having
been
committed
and
the
man
is
supposed
to
go
jail
for
30
days.
the
key
point,
whole
theme
of
this
case
is
that
we’re
not
talking
about
the
scope
of
police
investigatory
power.
that
should
be
dealt
with
directly
by
this
court
on
its
own
merits
and
it
should
not
be
necessary
to
have
subterfuge
substantive
offenses
in
order
to
deal
with
the
question
of
what’s
the
appropriate
scope,
the
least
investigated
power.
i
would
like
reserve
rest
of
time
for
rebuttal
if
i
may.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
there’s
also
a
lot
of
argument,
debate
took
place
before
terry
about
whether
or
not
the
limited
intrusion
of
a
stop
and
a
frisk
could
be
justified
on
less
than
probable
cause.
now,
you’re
asked
to
extend
terry.
you’re
asked
to
extend
terry
to
permit
convictions
on
facts
that
it
would
most
under
terry
justifies
stop
and
frisk.
they
want
to
extend
the
terry
to
cover
katz.
katz
was
the
third
of
the
three
persons
frisked
by
mcfaden
in
the
terry
case.
cops
didn’t
have
a
gun,
the
other
two
did.
he
wants
to
convict
katz
too.
now,
my
position
boils
down
to
this.
no
question
about
that
there’s
to
crime
problem
and
there’s
an
interest
in
reducing
it.
but
that
this
ordinance
is
not
necessary
to
reduce
it
because
of
other
available
means.
you
see,
while
the
american
law
institute
debates
whether
or
not
20
minutes
is
a
fair
time
to
allow
police
investigation.
while
the
uniform
arrests
that,
that
allows
two
hours
and
he
was
only
three
or
four
states
have
adapted
it
in
30
years
because
of
concerned
about
its
unconstitutionality.
the
city
of
euclid
once
allowed
to
detain
him
overnight
convict
him
and
send
to
jail
for
30
days.
while
the
nation
debates
preventive
detention,
the
city
of
euclid
want
to
prevent
its
conviction.
that
seems
to
me
that
the
prices
to
be
paid
for
what
the
city
of
euclid
has
asked
is
too
great
and
then
it’s
not
necessary
for
law
enforcement
given
the
fact
that
there
are
other
alternative
means
of
dealing
with
regulating
and
permitting
police
investigatory
power.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
the
record
i
believe,
the
affidavit
shows
his
address
on
clayton
road,
cleveland
ohio.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
i
don’t
believe
it
does.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
yes,
he
gave
the
officer
three
--
well
the
police
officer
testified
that
he
gave
him
three
different
addresses
when
he
was
being
interrogated
at
the
police
station
which
of
course
was
after
the
arrest
had
taken
place.
the
third
address,
the
officer
testified
was
turned
out
to
be
a
correct
address.
there’s
no
evidence
as
to
whether
or
not
addresses
one
and
two
were
correct
in
the
sense
of
being
alternative
residences
or
places
of
business.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
no,
he
did
not
state
who
owned
the
car.
the
police
officer
testified
that
their
check
of
the
stolen
car
sheet
revealed
that
this
was
not
a
stolen
car
or
had
not
been
reported
as
such.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
yes.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
that’s
not
in
the
record.
only
the
fact
that
it
was
not
stolen.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
that
it
was
not
stolen
car
is
the
only
fact
in
the
record.
there’s
no
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
whose
car
in
fact
it
was.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
no
there
was
not
which
bring
us
to
--
seems
to
me
the
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
white
earlier
as
to
whether
or
not
visible
or
lawful
goes
together.
in
other
words,
where
is
the
burden
lie
here?
who
has
the
responsibility
of
showing
that
his
use
of
the
citizen's
band
radio
was
linked
up
to
unlawful
enterprise
or
does
he
have
the
burden
of
proving
that
it
was
not
linked
to
unlawful
enterprise
and
that’s
one
of
the
defects
in
the
statute.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
mr.
palmer?
yes,
the
record
does
show
and
that’s
an
interesting
fact
because
unfortunately
in
the
printed
appendix,
it’s
hard
to
tell
what
is
printed
and
what
is
form
on
the
affidavit
and
what
is
written.
and
if
you
want
to
confirm
this,
you
can
look
at
the
original
record.
but
under
the
--
on
page
three
of
the
appendix,
under
the
affidavit,
it
calls
for
information
of
form,
it's
his
birth
date
and
then
the
officer
fills
in
5
17
32,
then
says
sex
and
the
officer
puts
m-color.
no
information
or
request
of
the
form
for
the
defendant’s
race.
it’s
wholly
gratuitous
and
i
think
that’s
perhaps
not
insignificant.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
officer
sepanic(ph)
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
yes.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
yes.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
right.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
right.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
well,
i
think
it
was
performing
in
both
of
them.
there
was
a
case
tried
in
cayuga
county,
a
year
two
ago
in
which
the
issue
was
an
off
duty
police
officer
was
killed
under
circumstances
where
no
premeditation
and
deliberation
could
be
shown.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
that’s
right.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
that’s
right
and
the
court
charged
that
he
was.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
that’s
right.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
this
is
not
just
an
apartment.
the
house
is
a
massive
apartment
complex
which
the
officer
testified
at
the
parking
lot
for
2000
cars.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
well
--
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
i
doubt
that
he
was
being
paid
by
the
city
of
euclid
for
those
precise
hours,
but
he
was
wearing
his
uniform
--
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
but
he’s
wearing
a
city
of
euclid
police
uniform.
he
made
an
arrest
of
the
defendant
at
gun
point
and
he
called
in
his
fellow
officers.
it
seems
to
me
the
--
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
i
don’t
recall.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
the
constitutionality
of
section
583.01
(e)
of
the
ordinances
of
the
city
of
euclid,
ohio
which
makes
it
unlawful
for
any
suspicious
person
to
be
within
the
municipality
and
part
(e)
defining
suspicious
person
as
any
person
who
wanders
about
the
streets
or
other
public
ways
or
who
is
found
abroad
at
later
unusual
hours
in
the
night
without
any
visible
or
lawful
business
and
who
does
not
give
satisfactory
accounting
himself.
now,
this
question
arises
on
the
following
facts.
on
april
19,
1967,
an
off
duty
euclid
policeman
who
was
on
his
part
time
job
as
a
patrolman
or
watchman
at
a
very
large
apartment
complex
in
the
city
of
euclid
had
his
concern
alerted
by
noticing
a
car
driving
slowly
in
the
parking
lot
of
the
apartment
complex.
at
a
speed,
he
estimated
as
three
to
five
miles
an
hour
with
the
lights
off.
secondly,
he
testified
that
his
suspicion
was
aroused
by
the
fact
that
the
car
stopped
and
discharged
a
“colored
female”
and
he
knew
that
no
colored
female
lived
in
that
apartment
complex
and
this
aroused
his
suspicion.
the
third
thing,
he
testified
that
aroused
the
suspicion
was
that
after
discharging
the
female,
the
car,
which
was
ultimately
determined
to
be
driven
by
the
appellant
or
defendant
here,
james
palmer,
turned
on
its
lights,
pulled
down
to
the
street
and
parked.
upon
approaching
the
car,
the
officer
testified
that
he
noticed
the
appellant
speaking
over
a
citizen’s
band
or
two-way
radio.
as
a
result
of
these
three
things,
he
asked
palmer
to
get
out
of
the
car,
put
him
up
against
the
car,
demanded
his
license,
his
driver’s
license
which
was
furnished
and
asked
him
to
explain
what
he
was
doing
there.
he
explained
that
he
had
left,
discharged
the
friend,
further
inquiry
about
the
identity
and
purpose
of
the
friend
resulted
in
no
response.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
the
record
shows
that
following
the
unsatisfactory
response
as
far
as
the
officer
was
concerned,
he
marched
the
defendant
into
the
building
at
gun
point
called
for
assistance
from
the
police
department
and
a
search
was
conducted
of
the
entire
premises
and
the
girl
was
not
found.
subsequently,
the
defendant
finally
agreed
to
state
where
he
thought
that
the
girl
had
gone
to
specific
apartment
number.
they
went
up
to
that
apartment,
by
this
time
it
was
2:30
or
2:45
to
3:00
in
the
morning
and
knocked
on
the
door
at
that
apartment,
the
police
officer.
and
a
male
answered
the
door
and
was
asked,
“is
there
a
colored
female
in
the
premises?”
and
upon
being
informed
that
the
answer
was
no
that
officers
left
continuing
to
search
on
the
premises
for
the
girl.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
the
record
shows
that
there
were
no
reports
of
any
incident
of
any
kind
that
there
was
--
not
ever
any
report
of
any
crime
having
been
committed
that
night.
now,
after
palmer
was
stopped,
frisked,
detained,
arrested,
searched,
taken
to
the
police
station,
interrogated,
stolen
car
sheet
checked,
it
was
determined
that
absolutely
no
substantive
offense
had
ever
occurred
and
that
there
was
not
a
(inaudible)
of
evidence
of
any
having
ever
occurred.
and
subsequently,
palmer
was
charged
with
being
a
suspicious
person
in
violation
of
this
section.
now
at
first
blush
perhaps,
this
case
seems
to
be
another
in
the
line
of
cases,
testing
police
investigatory
power
versus
individual
liberty,
many
of
which
incredibly
arise
out
of
the
cleveland
area,
mapp
versus
ohio,
beck
versus
ohio,
and
terry
versus
ohio.
but
there’s
one
crucial
difference
in
this
case.
in
those
cases,
the
issue
was
shall
a
concededly
guilty
man
go
for
woman,
go
free
in
order
to
serve
some
interest
of
constitutional
liberty.
here,
the
issue
is
shall
an
innocent
man
be
convicted
and
incarcerated
in
order
to
serve
some
putative
interest
in
law
enforcement
or
maintenance
of
order.
and
i’m
prepared
to
demonstrate
that
this
ordinance
on
its
face
and
as
applied
does
great
violence
to
hover
constitutional
rights
and
with
no
justification
in
necessity
of
law
enforcement
for
maintenance
of
order.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
the
man
was
sentenced
to
pay
$50.00
fine
in
cost
and
to
serve
30
days
in
the
cuyahoga
county
jail.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
no
by
order
of
--
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
by
order
of
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
service
is
sentenced
has
been
stayed
and
originally
pending
the
filing
of
the
jurisdictional
statement
and
now
appending
the
outcome
of
the
case.
there
are
three
fundamental
attacks
on
this
ordinance,
on
its
face
and
as
applied
and
time
perhaps
will
not
permit
me
to
deal
with
all
of
them
as
fully
as
i
might
wish.
the
first
is
vagueness.
the
rule
of
void
for
vagueness
serves
three
primary
interests,
that
a
furnishing
notice
to
those
who
wished
to
confirm
their
behavior
to
law
so
they
might
know
what
they
may
do
and
what
they
may
not.
limit
the
second
purpose
is
limiting
the
discretion
of
law
enforcement
officers
of
courts
and
juries
within
some
described
standards
in
order
to
prevent
arbitrary
and
discriminatory
enforcement
and
the
third
is
to
prevent
the
ordinance
from
being
construed
too
broadly
to
encompass
or
trench
upon
constitutional
protected
conduct.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
like
what
in
this
particular
instance?
frequently,
the
document
presents
a
self
most
often
in
terms
of
first
amendment
activity.
in
this
particular
instance,
the
constitutionally
protected
conduct
involved
is
the
right
to
liberty
without
--
except
upon
articulable
suspicion
or
articulable
facts
that
the
constitute
in
effect
reasonable
suspicion
under
terry
to
justify
a
stop
and
frisk,
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
crime
has
been
or
is
being
committed
in
order
to
justify
an
arrest
and
proof
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
that
a
crime
has
been
committed
in
order
to
justify
a
conviction
and
incarceration
pursuant
to
that
conviction.
and
so
there’s
liberty
of
movement
here
or
the
freedom
of
movement
which
is
one
of
the
--
of
the
constitutionally
protected
interest
involve.
they’re
constitutionally
protect
interest
of
the
right
to
be
free
of
discriminatory
enforcement
and
these
interests
are
served.
these
purposes
are
served
by
the
vagueness
doctrine.
now
usually
when
a
case
comes
here
on
the
issue
of
vagueness,
the
whole
case
turns
on
--
meaning
the
single
word
or
phrase
as
we
just
saw
in
the
last
case,
the
real
questions,
what
is
annoying
me
and
is
that
sufficiently
precise.
here,
we’d
got
four
or
five
phrases
which
individually
each
is
vague
together,
they’re
impossible.
wanders,
what
is
wanders?
what
does
that
mean?
we
see
in
judicial
opinions,
there
are
at
least
three
competing
interpretations
of
wander.
in
the
ohio
supreme
court
decision
of
columbus
versus
delong,
you
have
the
majority
striking
down
the
statute
on
the
ground
that
wander,
by
virtue
of
being
defined
as
aimless
motion
without
any
purpose
cannot
include
a
criminal
purpose,
therefore
it’s
limited
to
innocent
conduct
and
therefore
the
ordinance
was
held
unconstitutional.
on
the
other
hand,
the
dissent
says
that
within
the
context
that
wander
must
necessarily
mean
or
be
limited
to
a
criminal
purpose
wandering
for
a
criminal
cases
or
a
wrongful
purpose
and
therefore
the
ordinance
should
be
upheld.
in
seattle
versus
drew
the
court
struck
down
a
similar
ordinance
because
they
said
wander
can
mean
either
innocent
or
culpable
conduct
and
in
that
sense,
in
being
too
vague
is
too
broad
as
well.
a
broad
at
later
unusual
hours
in
the
night
with
that
visible
or
lawful
business
is
as
simply
seems
to
me
a
night
time
version
of
wandering
and
without
visible
or
lawful
business
begs
the
question
as
to
what
it
is
that’s
prohibited
and
what
it
is
that’s
protected.
is
professional
ricks
walking
the
streets
at
midnight,
visible
or
lawful
business?
when
he
has
no
defined
purpose,
were
not
answered.
then
of
course
we
come
to
the
most
incredibly
vague
of
all
phrases
and
the
one
that
renders
the
ordinance
most
effective
in
my
opinion,
does
not
give
a
satisfactory
accounting
himself.
satisfactory
account
to
whom,
whom
may
demand
it.
who
must
be
satisfied?
over
what
period
of
time
must
they
be
satisfied?
it’s
a
credible,
but
untrue
account
satisfactory.
is
it
true
but
incredible
account
satisfactory?
it’s
purely
subjective
and
purely
just
throws
open
the
door
to
the
police
officer
in
the
first
instance.
the
judge
and/or
jury
in
the
second
instance
to
decide
whether
it’s
satisfactory
and
even
to
decide
who
must
be
satisfied,
is
the
issue
at
trial,
whether
the
officer
was
satisfied
or
is
the
issue
whether
judge
and
jury
are
satisfied?
now,
the
same
principles,
the
same
defects
in
here
in
discussing
this
in
terms
of
its
propensity
for
arbitrary
and
discriminatory
enforcement,
ordinarily
a
statute
which
is
inordinately
vague
simply
by
virtue
of
its
vagueness
facilitates
arbitrary
or
discriminatory
enforcement.
but
here,
explicitly
it
authorizes
arbitrary
or
subjective
enforcement.
what
the
court
has
previously
described
in
other
cases
as
government
by
moment
to
moment
opinion
of
the
police
officer
on
the
beat.
the
law
as
its
drafted
on
its
face
can’t
possibly
be
indiscriminately
enforced
across
the
board.
it’s
inconceivable
that
that
could
be
done.
the
law
review
literature
is
replete
with
discriminatory
enforcement
of
these
kinds
of
ordinances
against
hippies,
yippies
beatniks,
bums,
people
of
unconventional
dress,
behavior,
length
of
hair
and
so
on
and
against
black
--
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
well,
ohio
has
exactly
such
speed
laws
and
of
course
any
law
could
be
subjected
to
discriminatory
enforcement
in
the
sense
of
arresting
and
prosecution
and
so
on.
on
the
other
hand,
dealing
with
the
question
of
was
the
speed
reasonable
under
the
circumstances.
there
are
objective
indicia
that
one
can
look
at
to
determine
reasonableness.
for
example,
how
many
cars
were
on
the
highway?
what
were
the
weather
conditions?
what
was
the
width
to
the
highway?
how
much
access
was
there
on
the
side,
the
traffic
lights?
so
and
all
of
these
things
are
objective
indicia
that
one
can
look
at
to
determine
reasonableness.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
more
often
than
not
that
is
the
case.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
that’s
right.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
i
can
see,
any
lose
susceptible
for
abuse.
the
question
is
--
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
well,
it’s
enormously
different
in
degree
if
not
in
kind
your
honor
in
terms
of
the
propensity
of
the
language
to
facilitate
this
kind
of
thing.
we
don’t
have
to
speculate
on
the
capacity
for
arbitrary
enforcement
here
by,
reading
by
the
terms
of
the
other
cases
or
large
articles.
we
have
right
in
this
very
case,
an
example
of
race
being
used
as
a
factor.
in
fact,
i
would
argue
that
race
is
really
almost
an
element
of
the
offense
here
because
this
is
one
of
the
key
factors
and
why
the
officer
testified
that
his
suspicion
was
aroused.
in
other
words,
this
is
a
black
person
in
a
white
neighborhood
at
night
and
he
shouldn’t
be
there.
he’s
automatically
suspicious
by
reason
of
being
there.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
yes,
he
did.
he
tried
the
case
himself
and
he
handled
the
appeals
the
way
through
the
ohio
supreme
court.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
no
he’s
not.
all
right,
i
confess
this
from
reading
the
record,
it’s
a
fair
question
whether
or
not
he
is.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
the
remarkable
judge
for
a
laymen.
this
is
the
first
thing
that
struck
me
upon
reading
the
record
when
he
came
to
me.
but
to
talk
about
vagueness
--
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
no.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
that’s
exactly.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
they
took
their
word
for
it.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
no
they
didn’t,
although
they
could
conceivably
have
stationed
one
officer
at
the
door
and
sent
the
other
out
for
search
warrant.
but
the
talk
about
vagueness
here,
while
the
vagueness
evils
are
egregious,
it’s
the
least
of
the
evils
because
vagueness
is
subject
to,
it’s
suggested
drafting
problem.
subject
to
being
cured
by
greater
precision
in
drafting,
but
assume
that
you
could
get
over
all
the
vagueness
hurdles
by
converting
this
into
more
precise
language,
you
still
have
an
ordinance
which
fundamental
purpose
is
right,
because
it
punishes
the
arousing
of
suspicion
and
the
failure
or
refusal
to
dispel
that
suspicion.
and
that
flies
in
the
face
number
of
important
constitutional
principles.
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
it
permits
various
levels
of
deprivation
of
liberty
--
permits
the
ultimate
deprivation
of
liberty,
conviction
and
imprisonment
on
facts
that
may
not
even
be
sufficient
to
justify
a
stop
and
frisk
under
terry.
we
don’t
have
to
decide
whether
it
was
sufficient
to
justify
a
stop
and
frisk
under
terry.
we
don’t
have
to
decide
whether
it
was
sufficient
to
justify
an
arrest
under
beck.
what
we
have
to
decide
is,
was
there
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
criminal
activity
that
justifies
the
conviction.
and
in
addition
to
subverting
these
standards
constitutional
derived
standards
of
proof
for
stop
and
frisk,
arrest
and
conviction,
the
burden
of
proof
by
reason
of
the
satisfactory
account
clause
is
thrust
on
the
defendant.
he’s
got
to
be
able
to
explain
away
all
of
the
ambiguities
or
suspicions
of
his
behavior.
as
far
as
the
satisfactory
account
clause,
it
also
has
the
defect
of
compelling
a
violation
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
i
would
rely
primarily
on
the
brief
on
that
point.
i
will
like
to
deal
with
the
citation
of
the
appellee
to
the
miranda
case
here.
this
is
not
a
miranda
case.
the
issue
here
is
not
whether
or
not
statements
given
by
the
defendant
were
sufficient
advice
and
sufficient
knowledge
of
its
rights
to
be
able
to
be
introduced
into
evidence.
the
issue
rather
is
whether
or
not
the
city
of
euclid,
multitude
and
as
other
city
similarly
situated,
can
compel
by
threat
of
60
days
imprisonment
which
is
the
statutory
maximum,
although
the
defendant
here
was
only
sentenced
to
30
days
can
compel
him
to
face
the
choice
of
either
going
to
jail
as
a
suspicious
person
for
failing
to
give
a
satisfactory
accounting
himself
or
conversely
giving
up
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
incriminating
himself.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
that’s
a
good
question
which
i
have
an
impossible
time
answering
because
the
thing
is
so
vague.
i
assumed
that
in
the
euclid
municipal
court
one
can
get
a
conviction
of
those
facts.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
visible
or
lawful
business.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
without
visible
or
lawful
business.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
i
don’t
know
how
we
can
just
read
visible
out
of
it.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
or
lawful.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
that’s
right.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
well,
you
see
if
the
visible
weren’t
in
there
and
the
state
had
the
burden
of
showing
that
he
was
engaging
an
unlawful
conduct,
it
would
be
a
vastly
different
ordinance
--
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
but
they
take
the
visible
are
lawful
to
mean
that
it’s
the
burden
is
on
the
defendant.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
to
demonstrate,
--
to
manifest
his
purpose
on
the
street.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
well,
i
read
the
states
case
here
as
consisting
of
the
fact
that
--
well
the
officer
testified
--
the
officer
testified
that
no
law
that
he
knows
off
was
broken
including
the
minuet
parking,
driving,
traffic
and
so.
there’s
no
law
to
his
knowledge
broken.
now,
where
is
the
unlawful
activity?
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
in
the
parking
lot,
he
turned
on
his
lights
before
he
pulled
on
the
street
and
then
on
the
private
parking
lot,
it
was
not
an
offense
to
drive
without
light.
the
officer
testified
it’s
in
the
record.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
that
he
was
not
trespassing
either?
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
he
was
bringing
--
he
was
bringing
a
person
to
the
apartment.
now,
we
don’t
know
for
what
purpose
he
brought
that
person
to
the
apartment.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
no,
no.
he
gave
the
explanation.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
that
he
had
come
--
that
he
had
brought
the
friend
to
the
apartment.
now,
what
he
did
not
explain
was
who
the
friend
was
and
what
the
friend’s
purpose
was.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
could
disbelieve
him
on
bringing
--
the
fact
that
he
was
bringing
the
girl.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
certainly,
certainly
they
disbelieved
him.
he
didn’t
testify
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
at
the
trial
--
when
i
relate
what
he
said,
i’m
talking
about
the
officer’s
testimony
as
to
what
he
is
alleged
to
have
said
on
the
premises
at
the
time
that
the
violation
occurred.
now,
as
to
trespass,
i
don’t
know
any
facts
that
would
render
this
a
trespass
in
a
sense
that
this
is
an
enormous
apartment
complex
in
which
kind
of
quasi-public,
private
parking
lot.
when
i
say
private,
i
mean
it’s
not
a
dedicated
thoroughfare
such
that
the
traffic
laws
requiring
lights
at
night
are
applicable.
it’s
quasi-public
in
the
sense
that
it’s
an
enormous
parking
lot
for
the
use
of
residents
and
visitors
as
well.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
as
far
as
the
law
is
requiring
one
to
have
lights
on
his
car
at
night
is
concerned,
yes.
that’s
the
officer’s
testimony
in
the
record.
it’s
not
my
interpretation.
now,
having
briefly
demonstrated,
the
constitutional
defects
with
this
ordinance,
both
on
its
face
and
as
applied
here,
question
arises,
is
there
any
necessity
in
the
demands
or
needs
of
order
of
law
enforcement
to
justify
these
infringements.
if
there
ever
was
a
need
for
this
kind
of
a
law,
it’s
been
dissipated.
the
argument
for
this
kind
of
a
law
historically
has
been
--
fourth
amendment
concepts
of
probable
cause
have
been
inadequate
to
allow
the
police
to
engage
in
pre-probable
investigation
and
inquiry.
this
court
i
think
by
its
decision
in
the
terry
case
has
taken
the
question
of
police
right
to
inquire
and
to
investigate
prior
to
probable
cause
on
a
plain
in
which
penalized
by
itself.
it
doesn’t
have
to
be
attached
to
subsequent
charge
of
a
substantive
offense
and
there
are
a
host
of
--
lot
of
questions
unresolved
by
terry
which
don’t
have
to
be
resolved
here,
but
without
passing
on
the
constitutionality,
many
of
these
alternatives
such
alternatives
as
the
american
law
institutes
model
code
of
prearraignment
procedure,
the
uniform
arrest
act,
the
new
york
stop
and
frisk
law,
the
common
law
authority
recognizing
terry
versus
ohio
in
the
state
version
of
the
case
all
of
these
alternatives
are
available
to
the
city
of
euclid,
to
the
state
of
ohio,
to
law
enforcement
officers
are
possibly
available
to
them.
obviating
the
necessity
for
making
a
substantive
offense
out
of
what
is
merely
cause
to
investigate.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
no,
i
don’t
think
so.
i
think
that’s
too
large
in
infringement
on
freedom
of
movement
without
some
particularized
compelling
necessity
in
the
circumstances.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
well,
if
my
answer
were
that
the
city
could
have
that,
then
certain
portions
of
my
argument
about
the
defects
of
this
ordinance
would
be
eliminated.
those
that
would
not
would
be
the
complaints
about
vagueness
and
the
complaints
about
compelling
violation
of
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
with
the
woman’s
what?
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
oh
certainly
could
ask
him.
no
question
about
it.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
i’m
not
objecting
to
the
officer
asking
questions.
i’m
objecting
to
the
fact
that
after
all
the
questions
are
asked
and
all
the
searches
and
frisks
and
interrogations
are
conducted,
there’s
no
evidence
of
a
crime
having
been
committed
and
the
man
is
supposed
to
go
jail
for
30
days.
the
key
point,
whole
theme
of
this
case
is
that
we’re
not
talking
about
the
scope
of
police
investigatory
power.
that
should
be
dealt
with
directly
by
this
court
on
its
own
merits
and
it
should
not
be
necessary
to
have
subterfuge
substantive
offenses
in
order
to
deal
with
the
question
of
what’s
the
appropriate
scope,
the
least
investigated
power.
i
would
like
reserve
rest
of
time
for
rebuttal
if
i
may.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
there’s
also
a
lot
of
argument,
debate
took
place
before
terry
about
whether
or
not
the
limited
intrusion
of
a
stop
and
a
frisk
could
be
justified
on
less
than
probable
cause.
now,
you’re
asked
to
extend
terry.
you’re
asked
to
extend
terry
to
permit
convictions
on
facts
that
it
would
most
under
terry
justifies
stop
and
frisk.
they
want
to
extend
the
terry
to
cover
katz.
katz
was
the
third
of
the
three
persons
frisked
by
mcfaden
in
the
terry
case.
cops
didn’t
have
a
gun,
the
other
two
did.
he
wants
to
convict
katz
too.
now,
my
position
boils
down
to
this.
no
question
about
that
there’s
to
crime
problem
and
there’s
an
interest
in
reducing
it.
but
that
this
ordinance
is
not
necessary
to
reduce
it
because
of
other
available
means.
you
see,
while
the
american
law
institute
debates
whether
or
not
20
minutes
is
a
fair
time
to
allow
police
investigation.
while
the
uniform
arrests
that,
that
allows
two
hours
and
he
was
only
three
or
four
states
have
adapted
it
in
30
years
because
of
concerned
about
its
unconstitutionality.
the
city
of
euclid
once
allowed
to
detain
him
overnight
convict
him
and
send
to
jail
for
30
days.
while
the
nation
debates
preventive
detention,
the
city
of
euclid
want
to
prevent
its
conviction.
that
seems
to
me
that
the
prices
to
be
paid
for
what
the
city
of
euclid
has
asked
is
too
great
and
then
it’s
not
necessary
for
law
enforcement
given
the
fact
that
there
are
other
alternative
means
of
dealing
with
regulating
and
permitting
police
investigatory
power.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
the
record
i
believe,
the
affidavit
shows
his
address
on
clayton
road,
cleveland
ohio.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
i
don’t
believe
it
does.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
yes,
he
gave
the
officer
three
--
well
the
police
officer
testified
that
he
gave
him
three
different
addresses
when
he
was
being
interrogated
at
the
police
station
which
of
course
was
after
the
arrest
had
taken
place.
the
third
address,
the
officer
testified
was
turned
out
to
be
a
correct
address.
there’s
no
evidence
as
to
whether
or
not
addresses
one
and
two
were
correct
in
the
sense
of
being
alternative
residences
or
places
of
business.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
no,
he
did
not
state
who
owned
the
car.
the
police
officer
testified
that
their
check
of
the
stolen
car
sheet
revealed
that
this
was
not
a
stolen
car
or
had
not
been
reported
as
such.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
yes.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
that’s
not
in
the
record.
only
the
fact
that
it
was
not
stolen.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
that
it
was
not
stolen
car
is
the
only
fact
in
the
record.
there’s
no
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
whose
car
in
fact
it
was.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
no
there
was
not
which
bring
us
to
--
seems
to
me
the
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
white
earlier
as
to
whether
or
not
visible
or
lawful
goes
together.
in
other
words,
where
is
the
burden
lie
here?
who
has
the
responsibility
of
showing
that
his
use
of
the
citizen's
band
radio
was
linked
up
to
unlawful
enterprise
or
does
he
have
the
burden
of
proving
that
it
was
not
linked
to
unlawful
enterprise
and
that’s
one
of
the
defects
in
the
statute.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
mr.
palmer?
yes,
the
record
does
show
and
that’s
an
interesting
fact
because
unfortunately
in
the
printed
appendix,
it’s
hard
to
tell
what
is
printed
and
what
is
form
on
the
affidavit
and
what
is
written.
and
if
you
want
to
confirm
this,
you
can
look
at
the
original
record.
but
under
the
--
on
page
three
of
the
appendix,
under
the
affidavit,
it
calls
for
information
of
form,
it's
his
birth
date
and
then
the
officer
fills
in
5
17
32,
then
says
sex
and
the
officer
puts
m-color.
no
information
or
request
of
the
form
for
the
defendant’s
race.
it’s
wholly
gratuitous
and
i
think
that’s
perhaps
not
insignificant.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
officer
sepanic(ph)
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
yes.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
yes.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
right.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
right.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
well,
i
think
it
was
performing
in
both
of
them.
there
was
a
case
tried
in
cayuga
county,
a
year
two
ago
in
which
the
issue
was
an
off
duty
police
officer
was
killed
under
circumstances
where
no
premeditation
and
deliberation
could
be
shown.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
that’s
right.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
that’s
right
and
the
court
charged
that
he
was.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
that’s
right.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
this
is
not
just
an
apartment.
the
house
is
a
massive
apartment
complex
which
the
officer
testified
at
the
parking
lot
for
2000
cars.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
well
--
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
i
doubt
that
he
was
being
paid
by
the
city
of
euclid
for
those
precise
hours,
but
he
was
wearing
his
uniform
--
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
but
he’s
wearing
a
city
of
euclid
police
uniform.
he
made
an
arrest
of
the
defendant
at
gun
point
and
he
called
in
his
fellow
officers.
it
seems
to
me
the
--
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
i
don’t
recall.
