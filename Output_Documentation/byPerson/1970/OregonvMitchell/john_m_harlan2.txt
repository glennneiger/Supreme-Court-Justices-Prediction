residential
and
the
recent
case
of
that
provision
do
not
involve
in
the
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
we
reserved
it
only
one
way,
in
one
direction?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
what
the
footnote
says
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
am
not
depending
on
the
footnote
because
i
was
on
the
other
side
of
it
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
bearing,
if
any,
do
you
think
the
fifteenth
amendment
has
on
this
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
know
that,
i
know
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
notice
that
in
your
view
the
court
decision
said
nothing
about
the
--
as
you
said
the
history
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
this
respect?
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
you
disagree
that
apart
from
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
constitution
places
voter
qualifications
holding
the
hands
of
the
states?
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
you
disagree
with
that
statement?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
haven't
seen
that
argued
though
--
these
arguments
in
any
of
the
briefs,
the
manner
clause?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
all
the
fourteenth,
fifteenth,
seventeenth
amendments
also?
justice
john
m.
harlan
with
hindsight
all
those
amendments
were
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
it
might
offer
a
inference?
in
fact,
as
it
occurs,
21
years
of
age
which
you
refer
to
as
current
voting
age,
was
exercised
properly
by
the
states,
and
that
it
did
not
effect
the
age?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
what
it
says,
21
years
of
age.
justice
john
m.
harlan
with
respect
to
21
as
fixed
by
the
states,
was
within
their
power,
would
it
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
suppose
these
cases
question
that
was
it
in
the
power
of
the
state
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
age
qualification
would
be
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
now
suppose
you
would
agree,
i
am
not
arguing
this
now
and
you
know,
but
i
suppose
you
would
agree
that
there
are
some
powers
of
fixed
qualifications
that
the
states
have
that
that
provision
of
the
amendment
wouldn't
justify
to
taking
away
from
them?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
a
pretty
drastic
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
which
would
give
the
right
to
fix
the
ages
of
the
voters
which
vote
for
constable
and
inferior
offices
like
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
suppose
that
mr.
solicitor
general,
your
view
as
to
katzenbach,
katzenbach
against
morgan,
was
not
only
the
equal
protection
clause,
but
also
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
john
m.
harlan
now
why
is
that?
why
should
not
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
if
congress
thinks
that
action
of
this
court
frustrates
the
fourteenth
amendment,
why
isn't
that
enforcement
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
why
do
you
say
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
the
indians
of
arizona
still
retain
suitable
indian
autonomy
in
connection
with
passenger
laws
or
(inaudible)
laws?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
for
the
election
of
people
officers
and
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
might
that
have
anything
to
do
with
condition
of
which
have
been
asked
about?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
they
have
members
of
the
legislation
to
state
senate?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
they
have
a
district
where
the
indians
can
elect
the
members?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
you
are
arguing,
the
second
section
of

fourteenth
amendment
does,
what

you
