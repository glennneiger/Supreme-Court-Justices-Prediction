mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
cases
now
being
argued,
numbers
43
and
44
original
oregon
and
texas
against
john
n.
mitchell,
attorney
general,
are
being
argued
first
i
suppose
because
they
have
the
lower
docket
numbers.
they
involve
only
the
question
of
age,
under
the
18-year
old
vote
provision
in
the
voting
right
amendments
act
of
1970.
and
i
am
representing
the
respondent
in
those
cases.
the
two
following
cases
are,
united
states
against
arizona
and
united
states
against
idaho,
numbers
46
and
47
original.
they
also
involve
the
age
provision,
but
in
addition
two
other
provisions,
one
relating
to
literacy
test
and
the
other
relating
to
residency
requirements.
in
those
cases,
i
am
representing
the
plaintiffs.
since
we
were
appearing
for
the
plaintiffs
there,
our
briefs
had
to
be
filed
before
our
brief
in
this
case
was
due.
the
consequence
is
that
our
principal
brief
has
been
filed
in
the
arizona
and
idaho
case,
numbers
46
and
47
original.
after
the
factual
statement
in
that
brief,
there
is
a
general
discussion
on
pages
23
to
39.
then
it
deals
with
the
literacy
and
residency
matters,
and
finally
it
deals
with
voting
age
at
pages
63
to
76.
the
general
portion
of
that
brief
are
arizona
brief
and
the
final
portion
relating
to
age
are
in
effect
are
opening
brief
in
this
case.
then
the
briefs
filed
by
oregon
and
texas
are
in
effect,
they
are
answering
briefs
and
the
brief
which
we
have
filed
for
the
defendant
in
this
case
is
in
effect
our
reply
brief
on
the
voting
age.
i
have
taken
this
time
to
explain
that
situation
because
i
think
it
is
a
little
confusing,
if
one
just
picks
up
the
papers.
the
chronology
and
the
sides
of
the
parties
in
the
several
cases
and
the
varying
issues
made
this
i
think
inevitable.
there
is
another
preliminary
matter
which
i
should
lay
before
the
court
before
i
proceed
further.
i
appear
in
these
cases
for
the
defendant
john
n.
mitchell,
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
in
the
two
following
cases,
i
appear
for
the
plaintiff,
the
united
states.
the
matter
about
which
i
speak
relates
only
to
the
voting
age
issue
which
is
in
all
four
cases.
it
does
not
relate
at
all
to
the
literacy
or
residency
matters
which
are
involved
only
in
the
arizona
and
idaho
cases,
which
will
be
heard
after
these
cases
are
completed.
the
voting
rights
amendment
act
of
1970,
originated
in
the
house
of
representatives,
simply
as
a
proposal
to
extend
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
which
by
its
terms
expired
in
1970.
and
to
add
a
provision,
making
it
in
effect
no
longer
as
invidious
as
it
had
been,
by
extending
the
abolition
of
literacy
requirements,
nationwide.
in
the
house,
provisions
with
respect
to
residency
were
added.
the
bill
was
passed
by
the
house
and
went
to
the
senate.
in
the
senate,
amendments
were
proposed
to
provide
for
18-year
old
voting.
there
was
extensive
consideration
and
debate
in
the
senate
as
to
whether
this
should
be
done
by
act
of
congress,
whether
it
could
be
done
by
act
of
congress
or
whether
it
should
be
done
by
constitutional
amendment.
when
it
was
pending
before
the
senate,
officers
of
the
department
of
justice
appeared
before
the
congressional
committees.
i
may
say
there
are
three
volumes
of
hearings
with
respect
to
this
bill.
one,
the
house
hearings
deals
only
with
the
literacy
and
residency,
and
then
there
are
two
volumes
of
senate
hearings
before
different
sub-committees,
in
the
summer
of
1969
and
in
february
1970
where
these
matters
were
extensively
considered.
deputy
attorney
general
kleindienst
appeared
before
one
of
the
senate
committees
and
presented
the
view
of
the
president
that
the
change
should
be
made,
but
that
it
should
be
done
by
constitutional
amendment.
this
appears
at
pages
78-80
of
the
senate
committee
hearings
for
february
17,
1970.
and
on
march
10,
1970,
assistant
attorney
general
rehnquist
presented
to
the
same
committee
a
substantial
statement
against
the
constitutional
validity
of
making
the
change
by
statute.
this
appears
beginning
at
page
233
of
the
hearings
and
the
court
will
of
course
want
to
give
consideration
to
these
views.
finally,
when
the
legislation
had
been
passed
by
congress
as
a
statutory
provision
and
not
a
constitutional
amendment
and
the
president
signed
it
on
june
22,
1970,
the
president
made
a
statement
of
which
i
shall
read
the
first
two
paragraphs.
this
is
the
president's
statement,
“on
wednesday,
congress
completed
action
on
a
bill
extending
and
amending
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965,
and
sent
it
to
me
for
signature.
as
passed,
the
bill
contained
a
"rider"
which
i
believe
to
be
unconstitutional,
a
provision
lowering
the
voting
age
to
18
in
federal,
state,
and
local
elections.
although
i
strongly
favor
the
18-year
old
vote,
i
believe
along
with
most
of
the
nation's
leading
constitutional
scholars
that
congress
has
no
power
to
enact
it
by
simple
statute,
but
rather
it
requires
a
constitutional
amendment.
despite
my
misgivings
about
the
constitutionality
of
this
one
provision,
i
have
today
signed
the
bill.
i
have
directed
the
attorney
general
to
cooperate
fully
and
expediting
a
swift
court
test
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
18-year
old
provision.”
there
is
more
on
the
statement,
but
that
is
the
relevant
portion.
the
attorney
general
is
the
party
defendant
in
the
two
cases
now
before
the
court.
he
signed
the
complaint
for
the
united
states
in
the
two
cases
which
are
to
follow,
the
arizona
and
the
idaho
cases.
he
has
signed
the
briefs
in
all
four
cases.
however,
because
of
his
relationship
to
the
president,
he
felt
that
he
should
not
present
the
argument
in
this
court.
so
i
am
here
and
i
and
my
associates
have
endeavored
to
support
the
statute
as
vigorously
as
we
are
able.
as
i
have
indicated,
these
two
cases,
oregon
and
texas,
involved
the
validity
of
the
voting
age
provision
only.
it's
interesting
to
note
i
think
that
oregon
has
a
literacy
provision,
but
it
has
not
chosen
to
contest
this.
similarly,
texas
has
residency
provisions,
but
has
not
chosen
to
contest
them.
thus,
we
are
dealing
here
only
with
the
voting
age
provision
which
maybe
the
most
difficult
of
the
three
provisions
to
support.
the
constitutional
validity
of
this
act
of
congress
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
believe
i
have
made
any
reference
to
that
one
way
or
another.
i
think
that
there
is
a
severability
provision
in
the
original
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
the
act
of
1970
is
inform
an
amendment
of
that
act.
whether
that
severability
provision
which
in
the
amended
act
will
appear
only
in
title
i
is
applicable
to
all
three
titles
or
not,
is
a
nice
question.
i
would
suppose
that
they
were
severable
simply
as
a
matter
of
my
own
personal
judgment
because
they
are
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
are
separate
ideas,
neither
one
of
which
is
in
any
particular
way
dependent
upon
the
existence
or
non
existence
of
the
other.
i
think
if
you
have
got,
when
we
come
to
the
residency
problems
in
the
cases
which
follow,
we
will
find
that
there
really
are
three
different
ones
there
and
should
the
court
find
that
one
of
those
is
valid
but
others
aren't,
there
might
be
some
intricate
questions
of
detail,
but
i
think
i
would
take
the
position,
though
it
has
not
been
covered
in
our
brief
that
the
statutory
provisions
are
severed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
as
mr.
justice
as
i
recall
it
there
is
a
general
severability
provision
back
in
title
i
somewhere
that
could
be
cited
if
the
court
felt
that
they
ought
to
be
held
to
be
severable.
i
don't
know
that
severability
is
focused
on
in
the
legislative
history,
it
is
perfectly
plain
that
the
several
things
were
discrete
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
were
not
interdependent.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
do
not
think
so
mr.
chief
justice.
i
will
ask
my
associates
to
check
through
and
advice
me
if
i
am
wrong
about
that.
there
was
just
no
focus
on
severability.
the
constitutional
validity
of
this
act
of
congress,
fixing
the
voting
age
at
18
years
on
a
nationwide
basis,
acting
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
i
find,
may
i
please
the
court,
that
last
week
i
constantly
referred
to
section
4
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
that
was
wrong,
it's
still
section
5.
the
constitution
of
this
provision
is
firmly
based
i
think
on
a
series
of
fairly
recent
decisions
of
this
court.
no
one
of
them
deals
with
this
issue
by
itself,
but
taking
together
they
seem
to
me
to
found
a
very
substantial
argument
that
this
statute
is
a
valid
exercise
of
the
power,
expressly
given
to
congress
by
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
this
can
best
be
shown
i
think
by
taking
up
these
cases
one-by-one
and
using
them
as
building
blocks
to
the
ultimate
conclusion.
there
are
roots
in
the
past
of
course,
but
the
first
of
the
cases
i
wish
to
mention
now
is
lassiter
against
northampton
county
board
of
elections
in
360
u.s.
that
case
upheld
in
the
absence
of
any
acts
of
congress,
the
validity
of
the
virginia
literacy's
test
as
a
proper
exercise
of
state
power
under
article
i,
section
2
of
the
constitution.
and
in
reaching
that
result,
the
court
said
at
page
51
of
360
u.s.
“the
right
of
suffrage
is
subject
to
the
imposition
of
state
standards
which
are
not
discriminatory
and
which
do
not
contravene
any
restriction
that
congress,
acting
pursuant
to
its
constitutional
powers,
has
imposed.”
now
i
suppose
that
analytically
that
sentence
is
a
truism,
but
it
does
indicate
that
the
court
considers
that
congress
had
constitutional
powers
under
which
it
could
impose
restrictions.
it
states
the
proposition
for
which
i
stand
here
and
it
is
i
believe
completely
established
by
this
court's
subsequent
decisions.
the
next
case
to
which
i
would
call
your
attention
is
carrington
against
rash
in
380
u.s.,
decided
in
1965.
there
the
court
had
before
it,
a
texas
statute,
which
provided
that
a
serviceman
could
vote
only
in
the
county
where
he
resided
at
the
time,
he
entered
in
the
service.
if
he
entered
in
the
service
from
another
state,
he
could
never
vote
in
texas,
as
long
as
he
was
in
service,
no
matter
how
firmly
he
had
established
a
residence
in
texas.
and
the
court
held
that
statute
invalid
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now
that
is
simply
section
1,
the
basic
equal
protection
clause,
there
was
no
act
of
congress
involved,
and
the
important
thing
to
note
is
that
the
result
would
reach
under
the
equal
protection
clause
alone.
there
was
not
a
trace
of
racial
discrimination
in
the
carrington
case.
there
was
none
of
what
was
referred
to
in
one
of
the
opening
arguments
as
classic
fourteenth
amendment
objectives.
there
is
no
suggestion
of
a
foundation
of
power
in
the
thirteen
or
the
fifteenth
amendments.
it
is
a
voting
case,
and
it
arose
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
alone,
thus
establishing
that
that
clause
is
of
its
own
force
applicable
to
discriminations
in
voting.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
texas
statue
did
mr.
chief
justice,
yes,
and
the
court
held
that
that
classification
violated
the
equal
protection
clause,
although
there
was
nothing
racial,
religious,
ethnic,
nothing
of
the
traditional
historic
basis
of
the
equal
protection
clause
involved
in
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
this
would
apply
equally,
yes.
now
of
course
the
reapportionment
cases
could
also
be
cited
in
support
of
the
applicability
of
the
equal
protection
clause
alone
to
voting,
but
the
next
case
that
i
want
to
refer
to
in
the
series
i
am
putting
before
you
is
south
carolina
against
katzenbach.
i
am
doing
this
in
chronological
order,
because
it
seems
to
me
that's
natural.
that
case
involved
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
the
statue
drew
support
from
the
thirteenth
and
the
fifteenth
amendments,
and
what
was
important
about
the
case
was
the
scope
it
gave
to
the
enforcement
causes
of
those
amendments.
section
2
of
the
thirteenth,
and
section
2
of
the
fifteenth
amendment,
and
these
are
identical
with
the
power
to
enforce
given
to
congress
by
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
under
those
provisions
the
court
held
that
what
congress
had
provided
in
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965,
the
abolition
of
literacy
test,
was
a
constitutional
provision
and
i
point
out
that
this
is
almost
immediately
following
this
court's
decision
in
the
lassiter
case
where
the
court
had
held
that
the
mere
existence
of
literacy
provision
did
not
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
provision
of
section
1.
the
significant
difference
between
the
situation
here
and
in
the
lassiter
case
is
simply
that
congress
had
undertaken
to
exercise
its
power
under
the
enforcement
clauses.
it's
quite
clear,
as
i
have
indicated,
that
it
was
not
merely
the
enforcement
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
but
also
of
the
fifteenth
and
residually
i
think
of
the
thirteenth,
but
here
is
a
situation
where
congress
acting
under
its
power
to
enforce
provisions
of
the
constitution,
made
invalid
state
statutory
provisions
which
had
only
recently
been
held
to
be
constitutional
under
the
provisions
of
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments
themselves.
now
a
few
days
later
in
harper
against
the
virginia
board
of
elections
in
383
us,
that
case
proceeded
solely
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now
the
court
held
invalid
the
poll
tax
provisions
which
had
long
been
enforced
in
virginia.
of
course,
the
situation
had
racial
overtones,
but
it
is
again
a
case
involving
voting
where
the
court
proceeded
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
perhaps
the
court
could
have
proceeded
under
the
fifteenth
amendment,
but
it
did
not
do
so.
of
course,
the
statute
and
decision
were
broader
than
any
matter
of
merely
racial
discrimination.
they
barred
white
voters
who
had
not
paid
the
poll
tax,
and
proceeding
simply
on
a
racial
basis
would
not
have
achieved
the
result
which
was
achieved
in
that
case.
now
the
next
in
the
line
of
cases
is
i
suppose
the
one
of
greatest
importance
here,
but
i
do
want
to
suggest
that
katzenbach
against
morgan
does
not
standout
all
alone.
it
is
part
of
a
stream,
a
part
of
a
development
which
has
been
occurring.
katzenbach
and
morgan
is
in
384
u.s.
decided
four
years
ago.
it
upheld
the
constitutional
validity
of
section
4
(e)
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
that
was
another
instance
of
action
by
congress
to
enforce
the
fourteenth
amendment,
taken
pursuant
to
the
power
granted
to
congress
by
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
as
the
court
will
recall,
it
provided
that
persons
who
had
received
an
education
in
american
flag
schools
where
the
language
was
other
than
english
through
the
sixth
grade
could
not
be
barred
from
voting
on
the
ground
that
they
were
not
literate
in
the
equal
--
in
the
english
language.
there
was
nothing
to
indicate,
and
never
had
been
anything
to
indicate
that
the
new
york
statutory
provision
requiring
literacy
in
the
english
language
was
invalid
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
by
itself,
but
congress
made
it
invalid
by
section
4
(e),
exercising
it’s
enforcing
power
and
this
court
upheld
the
power
of
congress
to
do
so.
the
court
proceeded
solely
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
other
basis
for
the
basis
for
the
exercise
of
power
by
congress
were
advanced,
but
this
court
did
not
rely
on
them.
the
case
did
have
ethnic
overtones,
but
the
carrington
decision
had
already
shown
that
this
was
not
a
necessary
element
to
establish
the
power
of
congress.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
it
may
have
some
bearing,
except
that
it
was
not
in
any
way
relied
upon
by
the
court
in
this
decision.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
moreover,
i
do
not
suppose
there
was
any
evidence
in
the
record
that
all
of
the
persons
effected
by
any
means
were
persons
who
would
come
within
the
provisions
of
the
fifteenth
amendment,
preventing
interference
with
the
right
to
vote
because
of
race,
as
at
least
as
that
word
race
was
used
in
the
fifteenth
amendment.
so
i
think
i
would
conclude
that
the
fifteenth
amendment,
though
a
part
of
the
background,
really
has
nothing
to
do
with
it,
and
was
not
so
regarded
by
the
court
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
we
have
said
that
because
we
can’t
find
anything
very
conclusive.
you
can
pick
out
passages
as
you
so
often
can
in
legislative
history
would
support
one
side
rather
strongly.
you
can
pick
out
other
passages
which
seem
to
be
almost
equally
strong
the
other
way.
the
legislative
history
is
reviewed
in
the
concurring
opinion
of
judge
mckenin
in
the
court
of
appeals
which
we
have
printed
in
full
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
in
this
case.
and
judge
mckenin
comes
to
the
same
conclusion,
pointing
out,
among
others
things,
that
after
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
adopted,
congress
went
ahead
and
proposed
the
fifteenth
amendment
indicating
that
it
did
not
have
the
view
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
alone
solved
the
problems
in
that
area.
it
has
sometimes
been
said
that
katzenbach
against
morgan
provides
a
startling
accession
to
the
power
of
congress.
it’s
clearly
true
that
the
full
potentiality
of
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
long
unappreciated.
indeed,
congress
did
undertake
to
exercise
powers
under
section
5,
shortly
after
the
amendment
was
adopted,
but
the
immediately
ensuing
decisions
of
this
court
were
not
such
as
to
encourage
further
experimentation.
perhaps,
it
was
a
sleeping
giant,
but
there
it
is,
and
it
has
been
there
for
more
than
a
century.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
not
such
an
innovation,
that
is
the
bringing
of
it
to
life.
the
eighteenth
amendment
had
a
similar
enforcement
clause.
in
katzenbach
against
morgan,
the
court
cited
james
everard
breweries
against
day.
you
will
recall
that
the
eighteenth
amendment
forbade
the
use
of
alcoholic
liquor
for
beverage
purposes
that
this
language
quoted
from
the
eighteenth
amendment
for
beverage
purposes.
in
the
statute
involved
in
the
james
everard
breweries,
congress
enacted
a
statute
under
it’s
power
to
enforce
the
eighteenth
amendment,
which
forbade
the
use
of
malt
liquors
for
medicinal
purposes.
now
the
amendment
gave
congress
no
power
over
the
use
of
liquor
for
medicinal
purposes,
acceptance
so
far
is
the
power
to
enforce
the
eighteenth
amendment
was
involved.
and
in
the
james
everard
breweries
case,
the
court
upheld
the
constitutional
validity,
and
discussed
the
scope
of
the
enforcing
clause,
saying
that
it
was
comparable
to
the
powers
given
to
congress
by
the
necessary
and
proper
clause,
which
too
i
think
were
in
a
sense
a
sleeping
giant,
not
until
they
were
utilized
by
congress
and
shall
i
say,
encouraged
by
the
famous
language
of
chief
justice
marshall
with
respect
to
the
scope
of
the
necessary
and
proper
clause,
was
it
fully
realized
how
far
congress
could
go
under
that.
similarly,
congress
has
no
explicit
power
under
the
constitution
to
regulate
intrastate
commerce,
but
the
shreveport
case
found
that
power
in
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
when
it
is
necessary
to
make
congress’s
power
over
interstate
commerce
effective.
more
recent
instance
of
the
same
exercise
of
power
is
found
in
united
states
against
derby,
and
in
many
decisions
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
the
national
labor
relations
act.
and
then
more
recently
in
association
with
south
carolina
against
katzenbach,
there
is
the
case
of
katzenbach
against
mcclung,
decided
5
years
ago.
likewise,
arising
under
the
commerce
clause
and
upholding
the
exercise
of
the
power
of
congress
to
provide
equal
accommodations
in
local
restaurants
as
an
exercise
of
necessary
and
proper
power
to
regulate
interstate
commerce.
one
other
case
here
to
which
i
would
like
to
make
reference,
williams
against
rhodes,
decided
just
2
years
ago,
is
an
election
case
where
the
court
proceeded
solely
under
the
equal
protection
clause
to
strike
down
provisions
of
state
voting
laws
which
it
found
discriminatory.
this
decision
along
with
carrington
and
rash
are
enough
it
seems
to
me
to
answer
the
suggestion
that
article
i,
section
2
of
the
constitution
provides
the
states
with
exclusive
power
in
this
area.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
it
was
decided
under
the
--
i
think
it
can
be
said,
under
the
thirteenth,
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendment,
but
certainly
under
the
fifteenth
amendment.
now
there
are
two
more
recent
cases.
kramer
against
union
school
district,
decided
last
year
in
395
u.s.
involved
a
new
york
statutory
provision
under
which
a
childless
person
who
did
not
either
own
real
property
or
rent
real
property
was
not
allowed
to
vote
in
local
school
elections.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
which
one?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
yes,
the
city
--
those
were
bond
election
cases
as
i
recall
it,
and
there
are
--
i
don't
think
i
have
undertaken
to
cite
every
case
that
has
some
bearing
on
it.
i
think
that
i
would
regard
as
cumulative,
and
would
take
whatever
support
i
can
get
from
it.
it
is
cited
on
page
33
of
our
brief
in
the
arizona
idaho
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
oh,
no,
mr.
justice,
i
don't
think
we
would
have
any
ground
to
stand
on
at
all,
if
we
didn't
have
section
5.
just
as
in
katzenbach
against
morgan,
the
english
language
literary
requirement
was
by
common
consent,
not
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
standing
alone,
but
when
congress
acting
under
section
5
made
it
–
when
congress
acting
section
5
decided
that
it
must
be
made
invalid
in
order
adequately
to
enforce
the
fourteenth
amendment,
this
court
upheld.
i've
just
referred
to
the
kramer
case.
i
don't
really
suppose
that
for
our
purposes
that
adds
anything
to
carrington
and
rash.
it
is
simply
another
case
holding
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
applicable
to
the
--
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
applicable
to
what
might
be
called
detailed
discriminations
in
voting
rights.
i
say
detailed
discriminations,
to
distinguish
it
from
ethnic,
religious,
no
negroes
can
vote,
provisions
of
that
kind.
and
then
most
recently,
and
in
some
ways
it
seems
to
me
of
the
greatest
importance,
i
am
sure
that
when
we
were
working
on
the
case
last
spring
in
my
office,
we
did
not
realize
its
significance
with
respect
to
this
problem,
but
is
the
decision
last
june
in
evans
against
cornman,
398
u.s.
that
case
involved
a
statute
of
the
state
of
maryland
under
which
residence
of
federal
enclaves
in
maryland,
in
this
particular
instance,
the
national
institute
of
health,
were
not
allowed
to
vote.
there
was
a
good
deal
of
uncertainty
in
history,
and
not
merely
the
history
of
this
particular
area,
but
also
the
whole
history
of
the
treatment
by
this
court
and
of
the
government
of
federally
owned
property
within
the
states.
it
was
found
for
example
that
residence
of
this
enclave
got
certain
benefits,
and
were
subject
to
certain
burdens,
on
the
other
hand,
they
did
not
pay
taxes
to
the
state
of
the
--
did
not
pay
real
estate
taxes
to
the
state
of
maryland,
and
insofar
as
they
were
renters,
they
did
not
pay
indirectly
to
the
state
of
maryland.
on
the
other
hand,
they
sent
their
children
to
maryland
schools.
if
they
wanted
to
adopt
a
child,
they
did
it
in
maryland
courts.
if
they
wanted
a
divorce,
they
did
it
in
maryland
courts,
and
questions
about
that
had
not
in
recent
years
been
raised.
now
in
evans
and
cornman,
like
kramer
and
like
carrington
and
rash,
were
solely
and
simply
equal
protection
cases.
they
are
cases
saying
that
specialized
discrimination
with
respect
to
voting
are
barred
by
the
equal
protection
clause
alone.
in
evans
and
cornman,
i
note,
was
as
it
appears
in
the
book
say,
unanimous
decision,
at
least
no
dissenting
votes
were
stated
and
so
we
have
two
lines
of
cases.
one,
a
series
of
cases
holding
that
state
control
of
voting
rights
is
subject
to
the
equal
protection
clause,
even
though
there
is
no
racial
or
ethnic
or
religious
basis
of
discrimination,
even
though
it
doesn't
come
within
the
classic
historical
foundation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
leading
cases
on
this
are
carrington
against
rash,
kramer
against
the
union
free
school
district,
and
evans
and
cornman.
and
then
we
have
a
second
line
of
cases,
that
the
enforcement
clauses
of
the
fourteenth
and
the
fifteenth
amendments
give
congress
powers
analogous
to
the
necessary
and
proper
clauses,
and
on
that
i
would
cite
three
cases,
katzenbach
against
mcclung,
which
involved
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
itself
with
respect
to
the
commerce
power.
south
carolina
against
katzenbach,
which
involves
the
enforcing
clauses
of
the
thirteenth,
fourteenth,
and
fifteenth
amendments,
and
katzenbach
against
morgan
on
which
the
court
relied,
and
i
think
could
only
have
relied
to
achieve
the
result
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
alone,
and
not
on
the
fifteenth
amendment
enforcing
clause.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
we
have
in
our
brief
at
two
places,
but
particularly
i
would
call
your
attention
to
pages
74
to
75
at
the
very
close
of
our
brief.
there
is
also
some
reference
to
it
in
the
introductory
portion
on
page
35,
i
believe,
and
there
is
further
reference
to
it
in
our
brief
in
this
case,
which
as
i
have
indicated
is
in
fact
our
reply
brief.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
would
say
that
it
does?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
not
mr.
justice,
though
i
think
maybe
i
would
have
almost
to
read
it
line
by
line.
there
is
that
rather
puzzling
provision
in
the
very
same
clause
as
article
i,
section
2,
which
says
that
the
state
shall
establish
voting
qualifications,
but
that
congress
can
make
or
change
provisions
with
respect
to
the
time,
manner,
and
place
of
holding
elections.
what
manner
means,
i
don't
know.
manner,
i
should
think
at
least
would
mean,
it
must
be
a
secret
ballot,
and
should
a
state
make
a
provision
that
negroes
will
vote
in
the
morning
and
white
people
in
the
afternoon,
which
i
don't
suppose
would
violate
the
fifteenth
amendment,
i
can
conceive
that
congress
would
have
power
under
that
provision
to
make
that
invalid.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
is
some
suggestion
in
the
cases
and
in
the
briefs
that
presidential
elections
are
peculiarly
federal,
that
the
right
to
vote
in
them
is
an
inherent
right
of
federal
citizenship,
and
that
congress
would
have
power
perhaps
under
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
to
make
provisions
with
respect
to
voting
in
federal
elections,
and
that
does
become
somewhat
relevant
in
the
cases
which
we
will
argue,
except
for
what
i
would
called
fringe
situations.
i
think
i
would
agree
with
you
that
but
for
the
fourteenth
amendment,
in
the
cases
i
have
already
cited
and
specifically
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
qualifications
to
vote
would
be
exclusively
a
state
matter.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
of
course,
the
fifteenth
and
seventeenth
or
nineteenth
--
seventeenth
and
nineteenth
amendments
have
limited
the
power
of
the
states
of
the
original
constitution
or
of
the
constitution
through
the
civil
war,
i
would
agree.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
with
hindsight
on
the
basis
of
my
argument,
the
fifteenth
amendment
could
have
been
done
by
statute,
except
that
congress
could
have
repealed
the
statute.
similarly
the
nineteenth
amendment
could
have
been
done
by
statute,
except
that
congress
could
have
repealed
the
statute.
both
of
those
are
now,
and
i
think
fortunately
are
firmly
fixed
in
the
constitution,
and
are
not
merely
a
matter
of
statutory
provision.
whereas,
the
provision
with
respect
to
literacy,
it
maybe
much
wiser
to
have
them,
so
that
they
can
be
modified
at
some
later
time
by
statutory
enactment,
and
it
may
well
be
true
with
respect
to
the
voting
age.
we
may
find
for
some
reason
or
other,
that
eighteen
doesn't
work
out,
and
the
congress
may
find
it
appropriate
to
repeal
that
statute,
and
the
states
will
then
have
that
much
greater
leeway.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
is
the
footnote
10
in
the
katzenbach
against
morgan
opinion,
and
i
fully
agree
that
congress
could
not
by
statute
repeal
or
make
ineffective
restrictions
which
are
found
in
the
equal
protection
clause
itself.
but
i
would
have
no
doubt
that
congress
having
undertaken
to
enforce
the
equal
protection
clause
by
a
statute
passed
under
section
5,
achieving
a
result
which
is
greater
than
that
which
is
caused
by
the
equal
protection
clause
itself,
as
in
morgan,
as
here,
would
have
power
to
repeal
that
statute
by
which
it
had
undertaken
to
enforce
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
comes
from
section
5,
and
the
necessary
and
proper
concept
which
is
included
in
section
5
which
as
united
states
against
darby,
as
katzenbach
against
mcclung,
as
everard
brewery
shows,
enables
congress
to
go
beyond
that
which
is
formally
prohibited
by
the
constitution
itself.
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
consequence
of
this
court,
not
merely
--
it's
widely
suggested
that
katzenbach
against
morgan
is
some
sport
that
suddenly
rose
out,
nobody
expected
it,
but
actually
it
has
a
very
sound
foundation
in
our
constitutional
history
in
various
areas,
and
it
goes
back
i
suppose
to
the,
shall
i
say
the
discovery
of
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
by
chief
justice
marshall,
or
at
least
the
adumbration
of
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
by
chief
justice
marshall.
now
where
is
the
discrimination
here?
doesn't
a
line
have
to
be
drawn
some
place?
of
course,
a
line
has
to
be
drawn.
the
question
is,
whether
congress
can
draw
the
line?
persons
who
are
18
to
20
years
old
are
a
class,
a
group.
it's
obvious
enough
that
they
have
interest
which
are
not
always
represented
by
older
citizens.
you
can't
brush
this
off
simply
by
saying,
well
18
to
20-year
olds
are
just
the
typical
of
everybody
else
in
the
community.
on
that
basis
you
could
have
a
statute
passed
by
a
state
which
would
say
that
only
citizens
whose
names
begin
with
g
will
be
entitled
to
vote,
they're
fair
sample,
and
it
will
be
a
lot
cheaper
to
conduct
elections
on
that
basis,
and
so
we'll
proceed
that
way,
and
that
obviously
would
be
invalid.
but
why
18?
well,
i
was
troubled
by
this
for
quite
a
while,
but
i
finally
resolved
it
in
my
own
mind,
in
a
way
which
at
least
came
to
me
to
be
fairly
clear.
now
suppose
a
state
said
that
no
one
under
40
could
vote,
or
that
no
one
over
65
could
vote.
if
one
looks
only
at
article
i,
section
2,
a
state
could
do
that.
perhaps
this
court
could
strike
it
down
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
but
on
that
basis
the
court
would
have
eventually
to
draw
the
line,
the
state
next
year
would
come
up
and
pass,
nobody
under
39,
and
then
nobody
under
38,
but
can
there
be
any
doubt
that
congress
could
pass
a
statute
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
to
enforce
the
equal
protection,
clause
which
would
invalidate
statute
such
as
i
have
suggested.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
what
i
am
suggesting
is
mr.
justice,
mr.
chief
justice
is,
that
congress
could
under
section
5
undoubtedly
invalidate
such
a
provision,
but
once
you
accept
that,
is
it
not
clear
that
congress
has
power
to
fix
the
line,
as
an
inescapable
element
of
its
power
to
enforce
the
fourteenth
amendment?
otherwise,
the
court
would
have
to
be
passing
on
a
succession
of
the
statutes,
and
finally
fixing
the
line
itself,
and
this
is
peculiarly
the
kind
of
line
which
it
seems
to
me
that
congress
is
better
qualified
to
fix,
than
this
court
is.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
on
that
mr.
chief
justice,
i
am
tempted
to
fall
back
on
justice
holmes'
dictum
with
respect
to
the
power
to
tax
is
the
power
to
destroy,
but
the
power
to
tax
is
not
the
power
to
destroy,
while
this
court
sits.
if
you'd
made
it
5,
i
would
act
with
considerable
confidence
on
them.
ten
probably
so,
12,
13,
14,
if
congress
actually
that
is
its
judgment,
that
that
is
what
it
should
do,
which
i
find
it
hard
to
contemplate
their
doing.
undoubtedly,
there
is
a
point
beyond
which
congress
could
not
go,
because
it
would
not
be
a
bona
fide
legitimate
exercise
of
the
power
to
enforce
the
anti-discrimination
provision
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
except
that
i
think
the
congress
has
power
to
do
it,
at
least
down
to
the
age
of
18,
and
i
don't
run
into
the
problem
which
you
raise,
which
is
a
problem,
until
congress
has
gone
a
good
yield
further
than
it
has
now.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
i
think
that
you
would
be
required
to
do
that
under
your
decisions,
that's
exactly
what
happened
with
respect
to
literacy.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice,
the
language
of
that
the
court
has
used
is
perceive
a
basis,
and
i
don't
think
this
a
matter
of
building
a
record
like
in
a
court
case
where
you
have
to
have
evidence
to
support
each
finding
of
the
court.
but
there
would
have
to
be
either
findings
by
congress,
or
legislative
history
which
would
provide
material
from
which
this
court
could
perceive
a
basis
for
what
congress
has
done.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice,
you
would
be
saying
that
though
this
is
not
a
violation
of
equal
protection
as
prescribed
by
section
1
of
the
constitution,
it
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
congress
can
do
if
in
its
judgment
it
thinks
it
is
necessary
in
order
to
enforce
the
equal
protection
clause.
just
as
the
power
to
regulate
intrastate
commerce,
never
given
by
the
constitution
to
congress,
is
frequently
upheld
by
this
court
as
an
inherent
--
as
a
proper
exercise
of
power
under
the
necessary
improper
clause
to
enforce
the
power
of
congress
to
regulate
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
don't
want
to
overstate
it.
i
think
it
is
a
very
close
question.
i
think
it
is
much
more
delicate,
shall
i
say
here,
than
in
the
commerce
situation,
because
there
you
can
--
at
least
we
have
a
long
tradition
that
the
intrastate
commerce
has
an
effect
on
interstate
commerce,
but
i
think
that
that
bridge
was
really
passed
in
katzenbach
against
morgan,
where
there
was
no
suggestion
that
the
discrimination
against
foreign
language
schools
was
invalid
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
no
one
had
ever
held
that
it
was
invalid,
indeed
in
the
case
immediately
following,
although
it's
complicated
by
the
fact
that
the
statute
was
passed
by
congress,
the
question
arose
with
simply
as
an
attack
on
the
new
york
court
on
the
new
york
statute,
and
this
court
found
it
invalid
not
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
but
under
section
5
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
pursuant
to
the
power
of
congress
to
enforce.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice,
i
don't
think
for
example,
that
the
decision
by
itself
without
any
act
of
congress
would
be
applicable
to
children's
rule
who
had
to
stay
in
hawaii,
and
studied
only
in
hawaiian
language
schools,
or
to
children
who
in
this
country
for
one
reason
or
another
had
studied
only
in
german
language
or
some
other
language
schools.
it
does
apply
to
spanish
language
schools,
and
thus
might
be
applicable
perhaps
in
parts
of
texas,
if
there
were
such
schools.
they
are
not
state
schools
in
texas
which
are
not
in
english,
but
there
might
be
private
schools.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
suppose
that
section
2
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
the
most
abortive
provision
which
still
remains
in
the
amendment.
it
would
seem
a
little
odd
to
me
that
the
only
effect
that
has
ever
had
in
american
history,
would
be
to
qualify
or
negative
the
power
expressly
given
to
congress
by
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
but
i
don't
think
that
there
is
anything
in
section
2,
which
in
anyway
qualifies
the
power
given
to
congress
by
section
5.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
i
suppose
that
it
might
as
a
practical
matter
had
a
deterrent
effect
from
having
an
age
above
21,
although
it
hasn't
been
enforced
as
to
its
other
aspects,
and
whether
as
a
practical
or
political
matter,
it
could
be
enforced
in
that
sense
by
reducing
representation
in
congress
if
states
went
above
21,
i
don't
know,
but
i
don't
think
that
there
is
anything
in
section
2
which
has
any
bearing
on
ages
less
than
21.
that's
too
strong.
it
obviously
has
some
bearing,
it's
stated
age
21,
it
certainly
reflected
the
understanding
of
the
time
that
that
was
the
current
voting
age.
i
do
not
think
that
it
can
be
said
that
article
i,
section
2
prescribes
21
as
the
voting
age
for
any
purpose.
for
example,
suppose
a
state
did
pass
a
statute
such
as
i
have
said,
nobody
under
40
can
vote,
under
article
2
they
might
lose
their
representation,
but
there
is
nothing
in
article
2
which
would
say
that
persons
between
21
and
40
can
vote,
because
of
article
2,
nothing
whatever,
because
article
2
says
21,
that
wouldn't
prevent
a
state
from
saying
you
can't
vote
unless
you
are
40.
the
only
think
that
would
prevent
a
state
from
doing
that,
would
be
the
equal
protection
clause
itself
of
section
1.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
would
say
background,
but
don't
know
about
backstop.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
to
issue
of
writ
of
mandamus
to
compel
congress,
to
reduce
the
representation
in
the
house
of
representatives?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
takes
me
aback
a
little
and
i
know
to
say
that
this
has
never
been
done.
i
suppose
that's
one
of
the
reason
why
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
but
states
did
on
a
wholesale
basis,
keep
people
from
voting,
contrary
to
the
provisions
of
section
2
of
article
14,
for
50-75
years
in
this
country
and
nothing
was
done
about
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
not
on
an
age
basis,
but
on
as
far
as
section
2
is
concerned,
that
it
was
equally
applicable
to
that
elimination.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
21
years
was
a
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
think
that
the
provisions
of
section
2
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
provides
an
inference
from
which
there
is
some
tendency
that
conclude
that
21
was
contemplated
as
the
voting
age.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
it
was
within
their
power,
yes,
i
have
no
doubt.
i
don't
suppose
anybody
has
ever
questioned
these
that
these
didn't
effect.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
twenty
one,
no
one
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
one
has
ever
questioned
that
21
as
fixed
by
the
states
is
a
perfectly
valid
provision
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
unless
and
until,
congress
undertakes
to
exercise
the
power
expressly
given
to
congress
by
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
enforce
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
i
think
that's
true,
and
i
am
sure
that
was
contemplated
when
it
was
written,
but
i
find
it
very
hard
to
find
very
clear
and
convincing
instances
of
things
which
the
states
can
do,
which
congress
cannot
change
with
respect
to
voting
by
action
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
it
must
be
recognized
that
the
power
of
congress
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
recognized
by
this
court
in
katzenbach
against
morgan
is
a
very
broad
power.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
if
congress
chooses
to
exercise
the
power
to
that
extent,
and
i
can
imagine
situations
where
that
would
be
very
important.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
i
can
imagine
a
bill
being
passed
by
the
house,
and
being
passed
by
the
senate,
and
going
to
conference
and
in
conference
it's
like
27½%
depletion.
we
got
that,
because
that
was
a
compromise
in
conference,
and
this
bill
might
well
have
turned
up
19½,
instead
of
18.
actually,
both
houses
of
the
congress
did
adapt
the
bill
at
age
18,
and
i
think
it's
not
irrelevant
that
the
key
vote
in
the
senate
really
on
the
issue,
whether
it
should
be
done
by
statute
or
by
constitutional
amendment,
was
64
to
17.
there
was
a
very
strong
sentiment
in
the
senate
that
it
should
be
done
by
statute.
when
it
went
back
to
the
house,
as
the
house
accepted
the
senate
amendment,
and
there
was
no
division
there.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
yes,
i
have
no
doubt
and
mr.
justice,
that
if
congress
finds
that
some
action
of
a
state
to
be
a
denial
of
due
process
that
it
could
pass
a
statute
within
considerable
limits.
the
chief
justice
has
forced
me
back
to
ten
years,
and
i
prefer
to
stand
on
five.
i
think
there
are
places
beyond
which
the
power
under
section
5
would
not
extend
to
voting,
and
i
suppose
at
some
point
this
court
would
have
to
decide
whether
a
statute
undertaking
to
enforce
the
due
process
clause
was
so
unrelated
to
that
objective
that
it
was
not
just
within
famous
language
of
chief
justice
marshall,
as
an
appropriate
exercise
of
a
necessary
and
proper
power.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
i
do
not
recall
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
conceivably
rational,
but
i
should
think
highly
undesirable.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we
are
going
to
have
a
federal
law
with
respect
to
this,
it
ought
to
be
nationwide,
and
that
would
apply
to
the
southern
tip
of
the
florida,
and
point
barrow,
alaska,
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
as
a
legislator,
and
i
can
find
no
difference
in
the
constitutional
position.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
these
cases
are
original
suits
brought
by
united
states
against
the
state
of
arizona
and
the
state
of
idaho,
both
arise,
as
did
the
previous
two
cases
under
the
voting
rights
amendment
acts
of
1970,
the
full
text
of
which
is
set
out
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
in
this
case.
it's
also
set
out
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
in
the
arizona
and
texas
case,
the
voting
rights
portions
are,
and
turning
to
page
78,
i
would
point
out
the
way
the
statute
is
put
together
after
what
has
now
become
title
i
which
extends
the
1965
voting
rights
act
and
also
steps
up
the
controlling
date
to
the
1968
election
in
the
alternative
and
not
in
place
of
the
previous
one.
then
we
come
to
title
ii,
which
extends
the
abolition
of
literacy
requirements
to
all
of
the
states.
that
is
involved
in
the
arizona
case,
number
46
which
involves
the
voting
age
requirement
too
and
then
in
section
202
of
title
ii,
we
have
the
fairly
extensive
provision,
dealing
with
residency
requirements
and
that
along
with
voting
rights
is
involved
in
the
idaho
case,
number
47.
as
mr.
wright
pointed
out,
there
is
in
section
205,
a
separability
clause,
it's
in
an
odd
place,
but
its
language
is
certainly
broad
enough
to
be
applicable
to
any
of
the
provisions
of
the
act
and
finally,
in
title
iii,
we
have
the
voting
rights
provisions
which
were
the
subject
of
the
argument
this
morning.
as
i
have
indicated,
both
of
these
cases
involve
voting
rights.
i
will
not
repeat
the
argument
which
i
gave
in
the
texas
and
oregon
cases,
but
i
do
have
a
few
supplementary
points
which
i
would
like
to
advance.
the
chief
justice
asked
whether
in
carrington
against
rash,
the
two
classes
were
not
identical
and
this
made
the
restriction
against
one
of
them
in
doubt.
i
think
i
can
respond
to
that
more
precisely
with
respect
to
evans
and
cornman
which
also
dealt
with
exclusions
based
on
residence.
there,
as
i
mentioned
in
my
argument,
there
were
differences
between
the
two
classes
concerned,
residence
in
the
enclave,
did
not
pay
real
estate
taxes
either
directly
or
through
their
rent.
they
were
subjected
to
somewhat
different
criminal
provisions.
insofar
as
they
were
subject
to
the
maryland
law,
it
was
pursuant
to
adapting
provisions
of
the
federal
statute.
the
issue
of
residence
involved
there
like
that
of
age
is
one
as
to
which
in
general,
there
is
a
substantial
state
interest,
of
course.
if
the
question
of
drawing
fine
lines
were
one
of
state
province,
then
we
would
have
expected
the
maryland
statute
to
be
upheld,
whether
people
are
maryland
residents
as
a
matter
now
in
law
which
seemed
to
be
in
the
first
instance,
a
matter
for
the
maryland
legislature,
but
we
think
that
the
court
was
right
in
that
case,
in
concluding
that
the
law
violated
the
equal
protection
clause.
in
the
cornman
case,
the
court
readily
could
conclude
that
the
basis
offered
by
maryland
for
the
distinction,
was
is
inconsistent,
was
insufficient.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
think
mr.
chief
justice,
the
court
decided
that
they
were
in
maryland.
the
court
certainly
said
in
its
opinion
that
it
was
within
the
external
boundaries
of
maryland.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
i
suppose
not,
but
i
think
the
court
must
have
decided
that
they
were
residents
and
citizens
of
maryland,
otherwise
they
couldn't
vote.
in
this
case,
the
court
alone
--
in
that
case
it
was
black
and
white,
either
they
are
in
or
they
are
out,
there
is
no
numerical
problem,
no
line
drawing
problem
and
the
court,
we
think
properly
held
that
they
were
in
maryland,
and
that
for
maryland
to
say
otherwise
was
not
supported
by
a
sufficiently
compelling
reason
to
take
it
out
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
in
this
case,
the
court
alone
might
not
be
able
to
reach
such
a
conclusion.
choosing
between
18
and
21,
requires
line
drawing
which
a
court
is
not
particularly
well
qualified
to
do.
congress
can
do
it
and
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
we
submit,
permits
it.
now
let
me
go
back
to
the
south
carolina
against
katzenbach
case
and
recall
attention
to
the
specific
provisions
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
which
was
upheld
there.
the
literacy
test
provision
sustained
there
had
a
trigger
provision,
fixed
by
congress
under
which
the
provisions
of
the
statute
went
into
effect
and
states
where
less
than
50%
of
the
possible
voters
had
registered
or
had
voted.
now
this
might
have
been
40%,
might
have
been
60%,
but
congress
made
it
50%.
this
figure
was
never
questioned,
if
congress
had
power
to
act
at
all,
the
establishment
of
such
a
figure
was
exactly
what
it
was
qualified
to
do,
better
qualified
on
the
whole
than
the
courts.
in
katzenbach
against
morgan,
the
statute
upheld
was
applicable
to
those
who
studying
in
american
flag
schools,
where
--
who
studied
in
american
flag
schools
were
spanish,
was
the
language,
had
proceeded
through
the
6th
grade,
not
the
4th
grade
or
the
8th
grade,
but
the
6th
grade.
i
think
this
court
might
have
found
it
very
difficult
to
decide
simply
under
the
equal
protection
clause
whether
the
4th
or
the
8th
or
the
6th,
i
can't,
it's
hard
for
me
to
think
of
the
record
which
would
really
support
such
a
determination.
in
both
of
these
cases,
congress
proceeding
under
the
enforcement
powers
of
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
drew
lines
and
fixed
exact
points.
this
is
the
kind
of
line
that
congress
is
well
qualified
to
draw
and
this
was
upheld
by
this
court
and
i
may
go
back
to
the
definition
by
congress
under
the
eighteenth
amendment
of
what
constituted
an
intoxicating
liquor.
some
of
us
recall
3.2
beer
and
i
guess
that
was
exactly
the
same
kind
of
a
line
well-drawn
by
congress,
perhaps
difficult
for
this
court
to
draw
pursuant
to
the
power
expressly
granted
to
congress
in
that
case
to
enforce
the
eighteenth
amendment.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
3.2
beer
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
was
excluded.
it
was
held
not
to
be
intoxicating
if
it
was
not
more
than
3.2.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
as
was
congress'
statement.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
court
decided
that
it
would
accept
it
and
i
suspect
on
the
basis
that
–-
well,
undoubtedly
on
the
basis
that
it
was
a
valid
law.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no.
i
am
not
sure
if
congress
had
passed
a
statute
saying
that
50%
spirits
is
not
intoxicating,
i
suppose
that
would
have
been
found
beyond
constitution.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice
i
suppose
that
if
court
would
have
sustained
an
act
of
congress
which
forbade
the
sale
of
anything
with
any
alcoholic
content.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
want
to
be
careful
to
not
to
jump
from
the
eighteenth
amendment
analogy
i
have
given
and
the
interstate
commerce
analogy
to
which
we
have
referred
and
the
fifteenth
amendment
one
to
the
equal
protection
situation
because
i
do
not
contend
that
congress
has
power
to
say
that
anything
which
this
court
had
held
to
be
a
violation
of
equal
protection
shall
henceforth
not
be
a
violation
of
equal
protection.
i
have
already
made
reference
to
footnote
10
which
in
the
katzenbach
and
morgan
opinion
which
represented
a
difference
of
opinion
in
the
court
and
i
stand
with
the
majority
view
that
the
power
of
congress
is
to
bar
actions
which
it
regards
as
denials
of
equal
protection
above
and
beyond
what
would
be
denials
of
equal
protection
without
the
act
of
congress.
that's
why
i
am
hesitant
about
as
entering
about
inclusion
and
exclusion.
i
also
said
this
morning
that
if
congress
does
extend
the
enforcement
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
i
think
it
can
thereafter
repeal
it's
extension,
but
i
do
not
think
that
it
can
repeal
a
decision
of
this
court
which
has
been
reached
without
the
effect
of
any
act
of
congress.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
because
the
constitution
itself
says
that
nor
shall
any
state
deny,
deprive
any
person
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
and
this
court
has
held
that
a
state
has
deprived
a
person
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws,
nothing
that
congress
does
under
section
5
can
be
an
action
by
congress
to
enforce
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it
can
be
an
action
by
congress
to
limit
the
enforcement
on
the
fourteenth
amendment,
but
not
to
enforce
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
have
-–
i
think
that
that
might
well
be
and
we
have
already
referred
to
that
and
specifically
the
virginia
literacy
statute
which
this
court
held
to
be
consistent
with
the
fourteenth
amendment,
was
thereafter
made
ineffective
by
the
act
of
congress
under
section
5
involved
in
south
carolina
against
katzenbach.
i
don't
know
that
congress
necessarily
decided
that
this
court's
decision
frustrated
the
fourteenth
amendment.
but
i
think
it
did
decide
that
under
all
the
circumstances
it
did
not
effectively
enforce
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now
let
me
turn
to,
first
to
the
case
of
united
states
against
arizona
and
the
literacy
problem
which
is
involved
there,
arising
under
section
201
of
the
statute.
under
that
provision,
congress
has
provided
that
any
test
or
device
which
is
a
phrase
taken
out
of
the
1965
act
as
a
prerequisite
for
voting
and
for
which
we
have
used
the
shorthand
of
literacy
and
requirement,
shall
be
invalid
in
all
states
of
the
country
to
which
the
trigger
provisions
of
the
1965
act
as
extended,
do
not
apply.
the
effect
of
that
is
that
literacy
requirements
are
made
invalid
throughout
the
united
states.
i
can
not
say
that
they
are
exactly
the
same
in
every
part
of
the
united
states
because
any
state
which
is
within
the
triggered
class
is
also
subject
to
further
provisions
under
which
it
can
not
make
changes
in
these
laws
without
either
the
approval
of
the
attorney
general
or
of
the
district
court
of
the
united
states
for
the
district
of
columbia.
those
provisions
with
respect
to
approval
are
not
applicable
in
idaho
or
minnesota,
they
may
be
applicable
on
one
county
of
arizona
and
they
applicable
in
alabama
and
mississippi
and
the
other
states
which
were
subject
to
the
1965
act.
so
the
question
is
as
to
the
power
of
congress,
seeking
to
act
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
other
provisions
which
might
in
this
case
include
section
2
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
even
section
2
of
the
thirteenth
amendment,
has
power
to
extend
the
abolition
of
literacy
requirements
to
the
entire
country.
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
the
way
the
argument
has
developed,
we
have
argued
the
most
difficult
case
first,
that
is
that
the
voting
age
requirement
raises
the
most
serious
intellectual
and
constitutional
problems.
in
my
own
view,
the
argument
with
respect
to
residency
is
a
fortiori
from
the
previous
discussion
and
the
argument
with
respect
to
literacy
is
a
multo
fortiori
from
the
previous
discussion.
we
have
here
an
express
determination
by
congress
that
literacy
devices
do
work
out
discriminatorily.
we
have
the
foundation
of
south
carolina
against
katzenbach
which
upheld
the
validity
of
the
1965
statute
and
more
recently
we
have
the
decision
of
the
court
in
gaston
county
against
the
united
states
which
held
that
merely
because
a
county's
current
practice
was
non-discriminatory
was
not
enough
to
take
it
out
from
the
1965
act.
if
the
continuing
effect
of
past
discrimination
in
education
continued
to
produce
persons
who
were
now
illiterate
and
who
would
be
barred
from
voting,
not
because
of
any
current
discrimination,
but
because
of
past
discrimination
that,
that
was
enough
to
sustain
the
continued
application
of
the
statute.
now
we
have
a
very
similar
situation
here.
it
is
not
suggested
that
there
has
been
past
discrimination,
at
least
within
recent
times
in
education
in
arizona,
but
it
is
very
clear
that
large
numbers
of
persons
have
moved
into
arizona
from
other
parts
of
the
country
where
they
have
been
subjected
to
educational
discrimination.
what
the
congress
has
done
is
in
no
sense
designed
to
punish
arizona
for
any
past
derelictions.
it
isn't
suggested
that
there
have
been
such
derelictions.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice
i
think
it
is
true
to
some
extent
with
oregon
and
idaho--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
to
an
appreciable
degree
and
i
suppose
any
person
who
is
illiterate
because
of
this
and
can't
vote
is
subjected
to
it,
besides
which
it
seems
to
me,
is
this
is
a
kind
of
thing
upon
which
congress
can
rightly
and
properly
adopt
a
national
policy
which
shall
be
effective
throughout
the
united
states.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
mr.
justice
there
--
mr.
chief
justice
there
is
complaint
by
arizona
in
this
case
that
congress
held
no
hearings
in
arizona
and
did
not
develop
the
facts
with
respect
to
arizona.
and
i
think
that
is
immaterial
because
congress
did
have
before
it
in
the
legislative
history,
extensive
material
as
to
the
movement
about
throughout
the
country.
it
is
perfectly
true
that
more
in
some
areas
and
more
to,
i
will
have
to
say,
in
big
cities
than
elsewhere
of
millions
of
people
who
had
been
subjected
to
discrimination
of
this
kind
in
the
past
and
congress
concluded
--
congress
and
its
members
were
well
aware
of
this
situation
and
could
properly
find
as
it
did
that
the
statute
could
be
based
on
the
enforcement
powers
under
both
the
fourteenth
and
the
fifteenth
amendments.
i
do
not
think
that
this
is
a
matter
which
has
to
be
separately
adjudicated
on
a
state
by
state
or
county
by
county
or
city
by
city
basis.
its
is
a
national
problem.
congress
is
our
national
legislature
and
undertook
to
dispose
it
on
a
national
basis.
this
is
particularly
referred
to
in
the
testimony
of
the
attorney
general
in
the
senate
hearings
is
on
pages
42
to
46;
where
he
dealt
at
some
length
with
the
house.
in
the
house
hearings
in
the
summer
of
1969
when
the
provision
for
the
extension
of
the
literacy
--
the
abolition
of
literacy
requirement
was
presented.
the
attorney
general
testimony
appears
on
pages
42
to
46
and
deals
with
the
matter
on
a
national
basis.
now
in
the
lassiter
case,
there
was
no
statutory
provision
under
section
5.
the
lassiter
case
holding
at
the
virginia
literacy
requirement
could
constitutionally
be
enforced.
here
we
have
an
explicit
legislative
provision
under
section
5
of
fourteenth
amendment.
there
are
i
think
as
up
to
date,
no
compelling
state
interest
justifying
the
imposition
of
literacy
test.
we
have
much
wider
dissemination
of
information
and
knowledge
about
political
matters
through
radio
and
television.
i
suspect
that
the
people
who
are
illiterate
that
numerically
speaking
far
more
get
their
information
on
political
matters
today
through
their
ears
and
through
television
then
they
do
by
reading.
most
states
do
not
have
literacy
requirements
and
never
had
had
them
and
some
few
which
do
have
them
do
not
enforce
them
as
to
which
i
understand
that
oregon
is
an
--
we
believe
that
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
extension
of
literacy
requirements
in
section
201
is
really
covered
by
south
carolina
against
katzenbach
on
the
one
hand
and
katzenbach
against
morgan
on
the
other.
so
i
will
turn
to
the
idaho
case,
number
47.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice,
not
with
respect
to
negroes.
i
think
that
there
is
some
suggestion
in
the
record
that
there
may
be
a
difference
with
respect
to
indians
in
arizona.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
not
with
respect
to
negroes.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
am
not
talking
now
about
some
what
remote
past
and
the
1870s
and
80s.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
people
come
to
arizona
in
substantial
numbers
who
are
illiterate
because
they
were
subjected
to
discrimination
in
the
places
where
they
were
at
earlier
times.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
legal
justification
i
repeat
is
not
punishment
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
is
not
retribution.
it's
simply
that
there
is
a
denial
of
equal
protection.
here
are
people
in
the
state
of
arizona
who
are
otherwise
qualified
to
vote
and
whom
arizona
will
not
allow
to
vote
because
they
are
illiterate.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
now
they
are
denied
an
equal
protection
today
by
arizona
because
arizona
won't
let
them
vote
today,
that
is
a
denial
of
equal
protection.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
reason
is
they
are
illiterate
and
the
reason
they
are
denied
the
right
of
vote
is
that
they
are
illiterate
and
the
question
simply
is
whether
that
is
such
a
compelling
interest
of
the
state
that
congress
can
not
properly
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
hold
it
invalid.
now
we
concede
that
it
is
inappropriate
interest
of
the
state.
we
concede
that
in
the
absence
of
action
by
congress,
a
state
could
make
literacy
a
test
as
many
of
states
have.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice
under
this
statute,
it
does
not
make
any
difference,
who
was
to
blame
for
the
fact
that
they
are
illiterate.
under
this
statute
the
mere
fact
that
they
are
illiterate,
no
matter
who
is
to
blame
or
on
what
reason
just
because
they
could
have
gone
to
school
but
were
lazy
and
did
not
go
to
school,
under
this
statute
they
can
vote
in
arizona.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
the
justification
mr.
justice
i
believe
is
in
a
sense
some
of
more
simple
than
that.
it
is
that
though
arizona
has
an
interest
with
respect
to
literacy,
this
is
a
matter
which
congress
can
pursuant
to
its
powers
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
regardless
if
this
is
the
origin
determine
is
not
sufficient
to
justify
the
discrimination
against
boarding
and
thus
the
denial
of
equal
protection
which
is
a
result
or
consequence
of
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
you
mean
in
arizona?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
the
indians
have
been
there.
indian
have
been
there
long
time.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
is
a
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
oh
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
indians
are
specifically
referred
to
in
the
hearings
and
there
is
evidence
that
a
much
higher
proportion
of
indians
voted
in
new
mexico
where
there
is
no
literacy
requirement
than
voted
in
arizona
where
there
was
a
literacy
requirement
and
there
is
a
considerable
basis,
discussions
in
the
record
that
one
of
the
reasons
whether
the
literacy
requirement
in
arizona
is
to
keep
the
indians
from
voting.
now
the
brief
for
arizona
does
show
that
under
mr.
justice
douglas'
interim
order,
requiring
that
people
be
registered
though
illiterate
on
a
separate
list
to
await
the
result
of
this
court's
decision.
i
think
only
21
persons
in
the
state
actually
were
registered,
although
the
record
had
shown
that
there
were
some
87,000
persons
in
arizona
who
were
barred
from
voting
on
the
literacy
requirement,
and
i
think
that's
a
disappointing
showing,
but
i
don't
think
it's
terribly
significant.
all
the
experience
in
the
deep
south
showed
that
you
got
the
people
to
register
only
by
fairly
intensive
voting
rights
and
indeed
it
was
not
very
effective
until
lots
of
people
went
down
and
gave
people
information
and
instructions
and
let
them
to
the
appropriate
places
and
after
a
while
when
fear
subsided
and
so
on,
and
more
people
got
out
and
did
it,
then
the
number
registered
greatly
increased.
and
i
suspect
that
if
this
court
upholds
the
provision
of
this
statute,
and
if
there
is
some
effort
to
register
people
in
arizona
who
heretofore
have
not
been
allowed
to
vote
that
a
very
substantial
number,
surely
not
87,000,
but
a
very
substantial
number
will
in
fact
register,
and
that
the
voting
rules
in
arizona
will
be
substantially
increased.
now
let
me
turn
to
the
residency
provision
which
is
applicable
with
respect
to
the
state
of
idaho.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
had
some
difficulty
in
finding
defendants
with
respect
to
the
residency
requirements
and
even
some
with
respect
to
the
literacy
requirements.
most
of
the
states
did
not
indicate
any
desire
to
contest
these
provisions.
the
residency
provision
is
really
three
provisions.
there
are
three
distinct
things
which
it
does
and
let
me
point
out
one
preliminary
matter,
it
relates
only
to
voting
for
president
and
vice
president.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
because
mr.
justice,
i
think
this
is
the
explanation.
with
respect
to
local
--
with
respect
of
other
elections,
like
governor,
even
congressmen
and
senator,
certainly
sheriff
and
district
attorney
and
all
of
those
things,
knowledge
of
local
issues,
knowledge
of
the
community,
being
a
part
of
the
local
community
is
relevant,
not
necessarily
controlling.
i
think
i
would
be
quite
prepared
to
defend
this
statute
if
congress
had
made
it
applicable
in
all
elections.
but
with
respect
to
voting
for
president
or
vice
president,
it
doesn't
make
the
slightest
difference,
barring
only
such
mechanics
as
arise
out
of
the
electoral
college
provisions
that
anachronism
with
which
we
are
still
bound.
it
doesn't
make
the
slightest
difference
whether
you
vote
in
arizona
or
in
new
york.
now,
it
is
true
that
as
far
as
i
know
we
never
had
an
election
in
this
country
which
was
determined
by
one
vote.
you
can
--
that
is
a
federal
election,
you
can
of
course,
assume
a
case
where
one
man
moved
from
idaho
to
new
york
and
voted
there,
and
that
was
enough
to
make
a
majority
in
new
york,
which
got
the
new
york
electoral
votes
than
the
fewer
number
of
idaho
votes
that
either
were
not
changed
or
went
the
other
way.
but
simply
in
terms
of
the
franchise,
congress
felt,
and
i
think
quite
understandably
and
rightly
so,
that
a
citizen
of
the
united
states,
who
is
resident
in
the
untied
states
ought
to
be
able
to
vote
for
president
and
vice
president
every
four
years.
that
is
the
-–
i
want
to
put
it
in
another
way
that
there
was
no
substantial
controlling,
compelling
reason
on
the
part
of
the
state
to
say
that
he
shouldn't
be
entitled
to
vote,
because
the
first
provision
here
is
that
if
you
have
resided
within
the
state
for
30
days,
you
can
vote
in
the
state
in
which
you
reside.
the
second
provision
is
that
the
state
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
we
still
have
it
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
oh
yes,
no
doubt
about.
it
is
filtered,
it
is
diverted
here
by
the
electoral
college.
the
statute
throughout
refers
to
vote
in
any
election
for
president
and
vice
president,
shall
be
denied
the
right
to
vote
for
electors
for
president
and
vice
president,
or
for
president
and
vice
president.
apparently
the
draftsman
of
that
provision
thought
there
was
some
hope
that
perhaps
we
might
eliminate
the
electors,
but
we
still
have
them.
i
think
that
if
we
didn't
have
the
electors,
i
think
i
could
almost
say
that
there
is
no
ground
whatever
on
which
a
state
could
oppose
this
provision.
it
would
be
a
little
bit
like
transferring
a
criminal
indictment
from
the
southern
district
of
texas
to
the
northern
district
of
arkansas.
it's
a
matter
of
convenience,
and
if
we
didn't
have
electors
and
we
simply
counted
the
votes,
then
the
only
interest
would
be
to
see
that
the
person
didn't
vote
twice
and
where
he
voted
wouldn't
make
any
difference
at
all.
now
in
addition
to
the
30-day
residence
limitation,
which
i
may
say
is
widely
in
effect
throughout
the
country
under
state
statutes,
the
act
of
congress
of
last
june,
also
provides
for
absentee
voting
and
absentee
registration,
under
fairly
short-term
provisions,
in
many
respects
different
from
provisions
of
some
of
the
states.
for
example,
some
state
say
that
the
absentee
ballot
must
be
received
not
later
than
noon
on
the
day
of
the
election.
the
federal
statute
says
that
it
shall
be
counted
if
it's
received
up
to
the
closing
of
the
polls
on
the
day
of
the
election.
then
finally
there
is
a
third
provision
which
purely
in
doctrinaire
terms,
perhaps
goes
the
farthest
of
all,
which
says
that
if
you
have
left
a
state
in
which
you
were
qualified
to
vote,
and
have
gone
to
anther
state,
and
have
not
resided
in
that
second
state
for
30
days
so
as
to
be
eligible
to
vote
there,
then
you
can
still
vote
in
the
state
from
which
you
came
and
of
which
you
are
no
longer
a
citizen,
and
you
can
make
a
complete
formal
argument
that
this
compels
the
state
to
allow
a
person
to
vote
for
president
and
vice
president
who
by
hypothesis
is
not
a
citizen
of
that
state.
and
yet
i
think
that
too
is
valid
although
it
pushes
it
further
simply
on
the
general
proposition
that
congress
was
concerned
and
was
rightly
concerned
that
every
citizen
of
the
united
states,
president
in
the
united
states
should
be
entitled
to
vote
for
president
or
vice
president
someways,
and
that
the
fact
that
the
exigencies
of
his
job,
or
simply
that
he
retired
and
decided
to
move
to
a
new
location,
or
problems
with
respect
to
his
family's
health
or
other
matters
had
required
him
to
move
just
at
the
crucial
time.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
--
well,
the
state
into
which
he
moved,
i
suppose
can
allow
him
to
vote,
in
which
case
i
believe
he
cannot
vote
in
the
other
state.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
i
don't
think
it
gives
him
any
option,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
either
he
can
vote
in
the
new
state
or
he
can't.
the
new
state
may
allow
him
to
vote
by
having
a
one-day
residence
requirement,
or
having
a
special
provision
for
people
who
move
in
from
another
state.
the
statute,
it's
on
page
81
of
our
brief
in
the
arizona
case.
“if
any
citizen
of
the
united
states
who
is
otherwise
qualified
to
vote
in
any
state
or
political
subdivision
in
any
election
for
president
and
vice
president
has
begun
residence
in
such
state
or
political
subdivision
after
the
thirtieth
day
next
preceding
such
election
and,
for
that
reason,
does
not
satisfy
the
registration
requirements
of
such
state
or
political
subdivision
he
shall
be
allowed
to
vote
for
the
choice
of
electors.”
now,
if
he
has
started
residence
20
days
before
the
election,
but
the
state
into
which
he
moves
says
you
can
vote
if
you
have
been
here
for
15
days
then
he
isn't
protected
by
the
statute,
he
would
have
to
vote
in
the
new
state
not
in
the
old
state.
under
this
statute
he
has
no
election,
he
can
vote
one
place
and
only
one
place,
he
can
vote
in
the
new
state
if
the
new
state
will
let
him,
and
if
the
new
state
won't
let
him
vote
in
the
new
place
he
can
vote
in
the
old
state.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice
i
believe
that
that
is
section
202
(i)
that
provisions
of
section
11
(c)
shall
apply
to
false
registration
and
other
fraudulent
acts
and
conspiracies
committed
under
this
section.
11
(c)
is
in
the
original
voting
rights
act
of
which
this
is
amendment
and
that
is
a
general
criminal
provision
for
criminal
act.
there
is
no
doubt
that
a
person
who
--
certainly
a
person
who
votes
twice
and
a
person
who
votes
for,
he
is
not
entitled
to
vote
will
subject
to
federal,
criminal
sanctions.
now
our
position
is
that
though
the
states
have
an
interest
and
we
don't
question
that.
the
states
have
an
interest
with
respect
to
literacy,
they
have
an
interest
with
respect
to
residency,
they
have
what
you
might
call
an
administrative
interest
in
terms
of
making
their
voting
procedures
not
too
expensive
and
in
such
a
way
that
they
can
effectively
guard
against
fraudulent
registration
and
voting
that
this
is
not
a
compelling
enough
interest
to
stand
up
against
the
exercise
of
power
by
congress
in
its
wisdom
pursuant
to
the
powers
granted
by
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
this
is
not
a
petty
matter.
it
is
estimated
that
5
million
people
are
barred
from
voting
in
this
country
in
presidential
elections
because
of
the
residency
requirements.
we
have
a
highly
mobile
population.
we
have
a
great
many
people
whose
jobs
are
with
big
companies
or
others
and
they
are
transferred.
we
have
the
people
coming
to
washington
and
going
from
washington,
not
presidential
appointees
so
that
they
may
have
a
domicile
here
in
washington
while
they
are
here,
go
back
to
their
states
and
the
aggregate
here
is
a
very
large
number,
something
like
3
or
4%
of
the
total
possible
voting
rules.
i
don't
say
that
this
will
increase
it
by
5
million
votes
because
not
all
of
the
5
million
people
will
actually
register
and
vote,
but
there
are
5
million
persons
who
will
be
made
eligible
to
vote
under
this
provision,
who
until
the
very
recent
past
have
not
been
so
eligible.
the
state
restrictions
have
been
loosening
up
in
recent
years
so
that
this
has
been
a
less
serious
matter
than
it
used
to
be.
there
is
no
real
argument
here
in
our
view
with
respect
to
administrative
convenience.
this
i
think
is
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
a
great
many
states
now
have
30-day
provisions
and
other
special
provisions
with
respect
to
the
election
for
president
and
vice-president.
the
states
will
have
to
change
their
statutes.
they
will
have
to
modify
their
practices
in
one
way
or
another.
the
fact
that
many
states
have
done
it
successfully
indicates
that
it
is
not
a
serious
matter.
now
indeed
four-fifths
of
the
state
which
is
40
states,
permit
registration
or
qualification
of
at
least
some
voters
up
to
30
days
before
the
election.
a
number
of
states
have
maintained
separate
rosters
for
presidential
elections.
the
situation
is
similar
with
respect
to
those
who
have
left
the
state
with
respect
to
absentee
voting
and
registration.
it
seems
to
us
that
decisions
of
this
court
in
carrington
and
rash,
and
katzenbach
against
morgan
are
applicable.
now,
i
have
discussed
section
202
mostly
with
respect
to
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
but
there
are
also
other
basis
which
can
be
relied
on
here.
this
supply
is
only
to
the
first,
the
foremost,
the
federal
elections
that
for
president
and
vice-president.
it
is
a
federal
event
with
respect
to
which
the
federal
congress
might
have
some
appropriate
voice.
it's
a
privilege
of
national
citizenship
or
at
least
it
can
be
contended
to
be
a
privilege
of
national
citizenship
to
vote
for
president
or
vice-president
derived
from
the
constitution.
it
is
one
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
of
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
analogues
to
the
right
to
travel
freely
among
the
several
states.
indeed
this
has
been
a
curve,
a
break,
a
restrain
on
freedom
of
movement
among
the
several
states
and
i
think
all
of
us
have
known
people
who
did
delay
they
move
until
after
an
election
or
who
were
very
concerned
because
they
couldn't
vote
because
they
had
to
move
before
an
election.
such
case
as
edwards
against
california
can
also
be
relied
on.
for
these
reasons
we
think
that
the
prayers
of
the
complaints
in
these
two
cases
should
be
granted.
that
a
declaration
should
issue
that
the
statute
enacted
by
congress
is
constitutional
and
that
the
state
should
be
enjoined
from
enforcing
their
statutes
which
are
in
conflict
with
the
federal
statute.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
first,
i
would
like
to
thank
mr.
mcgowan
for
correcting
the
figures
i
gave
as
to
the
number
of
persons
barred
from
voting
in
arizona
and
the
tiny
number
who
did
register
under
mr.
justice
douglas'
order.
i
was
speaking
from
memory
and
i
am
sorry
that
i
have
them
somewhat
inaccurate.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
couldn't
follow
the
discussion,
i
am
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice
because
the
statute
provides
that
the
ballot
must
be
received
by
the
closing
of
the
polls.
there
is
no
obligation
on
the
state
to
get
the
ballot
there,
the
obligation
is
on
the
voter
and
on
the
united
states
post
office
and
the
voter
ought
to
be
aware
that
he
better
allow
plenty
of
time
if
the
post
office
is
going
to
have
it
received
by
the
time
the
polls
are
closed.
if
the
ballot
is
received
by
the
time
the
polls
are
closed,
i
don't
see
any
burden
on
the
state
above
and
beyond
that
which
is
presented
by
the
voter
who
comes
in
five
minutes
before
the
polls
are
closed
and
cast
his
votes.
so
i
couldn't
follow
that
particular
argument.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
there
is
some
problem
about
following
up
here.
what
will
happen
in
some
cases
i
suppose
will
be
that
there
will
be
charge
of
sometime
made
that
this
man
voted
twice,
it
can
then
be
investigated
without
great
difficulty.
it
maybe
somewhat
hard
in
advance
to
prevent
dual
voting.
although
i
think
this
is
really
a
threat,
but
not
a
very
serious
matter.
time
may
come
when
we
will
have
electronic
checkups
by
social
security
numbers
and
things
of
that
kind
which
will
be
varied.
but
even
in
the
meantime
there
are
telephones
and
i
have
no
doubt
there
are
telephones
in
idaho
which
extend
to
a
great
many
places
where
it
won't
be
very
difficult
to
get
the
information.
in
this
connection
i
think
it
is
relevant
that
arizona
is
a
large
partially
populated
state
with
very
similar
problems,
mountains
and
desert
and
the
chief
proponent
of
much
of
this
legislation
was
senator
goldwater
from
arizona.
also,
i
think
it
is
relevant
with
respect
to
the
argument
of
arizona
about
the
literacy
requirement.
although,
senator
goldwater
was
primarily
interested
in
the
residency
aspects,
he
took
an
active
part
in
all
of
the
discussion
and
he
had
at
no
point
opposed
the
legislation
with
respect
to
literacy
on
the
ground
that
it
would
present
special
problems
in
arizona.
moreover,
it
was
suggested
on
behalf
of
arizona
that
the
problem
with
respect
to
literacy
in
arizona
was
due
to
the
default
of
the
united
states
in
not
providing
adequate
education
to
the
indians
and
if
that
is
true,
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
there
is
a
substantial
measure
of
responsibility
there.
i
assure
that
the
united
states
ought
to
be
able
to
take
steps
to
remedy
its
own
default.
with
respect
to
the
problem
of
persons
who
moved
into
the
state
of
arizona
who
had
been
discriminated
against
with
in
their
education
in
other
states,
this
was
specifically
pointed
out
by
the
attorney
general
in
his
testimony
both
in
the
house
and
in
the
senate.
the
gaston
county
case
was
expressly
relied
upon
by
him
and
by
others
and
it
was
never
effectively
countered.
the
--
in
the
senate,
there
was
never
any
committee
report.
there
was
a
problem
getting
it
out
of
the
judiciary
committee
and
it
was
taken
out
by
another
legislative
device
but
ten
members
constituting
a
majority
of
the
senate
judiciary
committee
and
this
is
printed
on
page
40
of
our
brief,
issued
a
joint
statement
which
it
seems
to
me
under
all
the
circumstances
can
be
treated
as
the
equivalent
of
a
committee
report
in
which
they
said
that
this
extension
of
the
suspension
of
test
to
areas
not
covered
by
the
1965
act
and
incidentally,
i
think
it
is
not
irrelevant
that
this
statute
does
not
invalidate,
does
not
nullify
state
literacy
test,
it
suspends
them
for
five
years.
they
said
that
this
extension
of
the
suspension
is
justified
for
two
reasons.
one,
because
of
the
discriminatory
impact
which
the
requirement
of
literacy
as
a
precondition
to
voting
may
have
on
minority
groups
and
the
poor
and
there
is
nothing
there
about
who
is
responsible
for
it,
where
it
happened.
we
are
going
to
make
them
be
good
because
they
were
bad
in
the
past,
is
simply
a
current
fact.
a
large
proportion
of
the
persons
who
are
now
illiterate
for
one
reason
or
another
are
of
minority
groups
and
of
the
poor
and
thus
the
literacy
requirement
has
a
specific
impact
on
them,
and
two,
the
joint
statement
continued
because
there
is
insufficient
relationship
between
literacy
and
responsible
interest
of
voting
to
justify
such
a
broad
restriction
of
the
franchise.
now
that
committee
and
the
congress
proceeded
to
view
the
problem
as
a
national
problem
and
to
legislate
on
a
national
basis.
now
what
the
specific
fact
is
in
a
particular
state,
whether
in
one
state,
it
is
a
more
serious
problem
than
in
another,
is
not
important.
the
objective
which
congress
had
in
mind
and
could
appropriately
have
in
mind,
we
believe
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
to
eliminate
denials
of
the
equal
protection
law
anywhere
in
the
united
states,
large
or
small.
in
last
analysis,
it
seems
to
us
that
these
three
problems,
voting
age,
literacy
and
residence
are
in
fact
very
similar
and
i
would
not
necessarily
say
that
they
must
to
stand
or
fall
together.
there
are
different
arguments
which
can
be
made
with
respect
to
one
of
them.
the
voting
age,
i
believe,
stands
only
on
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
whereas
section
2
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
other
provisions
can
be
brought
in,
in
addition
with
respect
to
the
others.
these
are
in
our
view
matters
which
lie
within
the
judgment
of
congress
pursuant
to
its
power
to
enforce
these
several
provisions
of
the
constitution.
suggestions
have
been
made
that
congress
might
go
to
extremes.
if
congress
goes
to
extremes,
that
will
be
another
case
and
it
can
be
dealt
with
and
this
court
is
still
sitting.
but
in
this
case
in
our
view,
congress
has
not
gone
to
an
extreme.
what
congress
has
done
is
an
appropriate
action
within
the
concept
of
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
as
established
by
chief
justice
marshall
a
150
years
ago
and
should
be
sustained
by
this
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
cases
now
being
argued,
numbers
43
and
44
original
oregon
and
texas
against
john
n.
mitchell,
attorney
general,
are
being
argued
first
i
suppose
because
they
have
the
lower
docket
numbers.
they
involve
only
the
question
of
age,
under
the
18-year
old
vote
provision
in
the
voting
right
amendments
act
of
1970.
and
i
am
representing
the
respondent
in
those
cases.
the
two
following
cases
are,
united
states
against
arizona
and
united
states
against
idaho,
numbers
46
and
47
original.
they
also
involve
the
age
provision,
but
in
addition
two
other
provisions,
one
relating
to
literacy
test
and
the
other
relating
to
residency
requirements.
in
those
cases,
i
am
representing
the
plaintiffs.
since
we
were
appearing
for
the
plaintiffs
there,
our
briefs
had
to
be
filed
before
our
brief
in
this
case
was
due.
the
consequence
is
that
our
principal
brief
has
been
filed
in
the
arizona
and
idaho
case,
numbers
46
and
47
original.
after
the
factual
statement
in
that
brief,
there
is
a
general
discussion
on
pages
23
to
39.
then
it
deals
with
the
literacy
and
residency
matters,
and
finally
it
deals
with
voting
age
at
pages
63
to
76.
the
general
portion
of
that
brief
are
arizona
brief
and
the
final
portion
relating
to
age
are
in
effect
are
opening
brief
in
this
case.
then
the
briefs
filed
by
oregon
and
texas
are
in
effect,
they
are
answering
briefs
and
the
brief
which
we
have
filed
for
the
defendant
in
this
case
is
in
effect
our
reply
brief
on
the
voting
age.
i
have
taken
this
time
to
explain
that
situation
because
i
think
it
is
a
little
confusing,
if
one
just
picks
up
the
papers.
the
chronology
and
the
sides
of
the
parties
in
the
several
cases
and
the
varying
issues
made
this
i
think
inevitable.
there
is
another
preliminary
matter
which
i
should
lay
before
the
court
before
i
proceed
further.
i
appear
in
these
cases
for
the
defendant
john
n.
mitchell,
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
in
the
two
following
cases,
i
appear
for
the
plaintiff,
the
united
states.
the
matter
about
which
i
speak
relates
only
to
the
voting
age
issue
which
is
in
all
four
cases.
it
does
not
relate
at
all
to
the
literacy
or
residency
matters
which
are
involved
only
in
the
arizona
and
idaho
cases,
which
will
be
heard
after
these
cases
are
completed.
the
voting
rights
amendment
act
of
1970,
originated
in
the
house
of
representatives,
simply
as
a
proposal
to
extend
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
which
by
its
terms
expired
in
1970.
and
to
add
a
provision,
making
it
in
effect
no
longer
as
invidious
as
it
had
been,
by
extending
the
abolition
of
literacy
requirements,
nationwide.
in
the
house,
provisions
with
respect
to
residency
were
added.
the
bill
was
passed
by
the
house
and
went
to
the
senate.
in
the
senate,
amendments
were
proposed
to
provide
for
18-year
old
voting.
there
was
extensive
consideration
and
debate
in
the
senate
as
to
whether
this
should
be
done
by
act
of
congress,
whether
it
could
be
done
by
act
of
congress
or
whether
it
should
be
done
by
constitutional
amendment.
when
it
was
pending
before
the
senate,
officers
of
the
department
of
justice
appeared
before
the
congressional
committees.
i
may
say
there
are
three
volumes
of
hearings
with
respect
to
this
bill.
one,
the
house
hearings
deals
only
with
the
literacy
and
residency,
and
then
there
are
two
volumes
of
senate
hearings
before
different
sub-committees,
in
the
summer
of
1969
and
in
february
1970
where
these
matters
were
extensively
considered.
deputy
attorney
general
kleindienst
appeared
before
one
of
the
senate
committees
and
presented
the
view
of
the
president
that
the
change
should
be
made,
but
that
it
should
be
done
by
constitutional
amendment.
this
appears
at
pages
78-80
of
the
senate
committee
hearings
for
february
17,
1970.
and
on
march
10,
1970,
assistant
attorney
general
rehnquist
presented
to
the
same
committee
a
substantial
statement
against
the
constitutional
validity
of
making
the
change
by
statute.
this
appears
beginning
at
page
233
of
the
hearings
and
the
court
will
of
course
want
to
give
consideration
to
these
views.
finally,
when
the
legislation
had
been
passed
by
congress
as
a
statutory
provision
and
not
a
constitutional
amendment
and
the
president
signed
it
on
june
22,
1970,
the
president
made
a
statement
of
which
i
shall
read
the
first
two
paragraphs.
this
is
the
president's
statement,
“on
wednesday,
congress
completed
action
on
a
bill
extending
and
amending
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965,
and
sent
it
to
me
for
signature.
as
passed,
the
bill
contained
a
"rider"
which
i
believe
to
be
unconstitutional,
a
provision
lowering
the
voting
age
to
18
in
federal,
state,
and
local
elections.
although
i
strongly
favor
the
18-year
old
vote,
i
believe
along
with
most
of
the
nation's
leading
constitutional
scholars
that
congress
has
no
power
to
enact
it
by
simple
statute,
but
rather
it
requires
a
constitutional
amendment.
despite
my
misgivings
about
the
constitutionality
of
this
one
provision,
i
have
today
signed
the
bill.
i
have
directed
the
attorney
general
to
cooperate
fully
and
expediting
a
swift
court
test
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
18-year
old
provision.”
there
is
more
on
the
statement,
but
that
is
the
relevant
portion.
the
attorney
general
is
the
party
defendant
in
the
two
cases
now
before
the
court.
he
signed
the
complaint
for
the
united
states
in
the
two
cases
which
are
to
follow,
the
arizona
and
the
idaho
cases.
he
has
signed
the
briefs
in
all
four
cases.
however,
because
of
his
relationship
to
the
president,
he
felt
that
he
should
not
present
the
argument
in
this
court.
so
i
am
here
and
i
and
my
associates
have
endeavored
to
support
the
statute
as
vigorously
as
we
are
able.
as
i
have
indicated,
these
two
cases,
oregon
and
texas,
involved
the
validity
of
the
voting
age
provision
only.
it's
interesting
to
note
i
think
that
oregon
has
a
literacy
provision,
but
it
has
not
chosen
to
contest
this.
similarly,
texas
has
residency
provisions,
but
has
not
chosen
to
contest
them.
thus,
we
are
dealing
here
only
with
the
voting
age
provision
which
maybe
the
most
difficult
of
the
three
provisions
to
support.
the
constitutional
validity
of
this
act
of
congress
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
believe
i
have
made
any
reference
to
that
one
way
or
another.
i
think
that
there
is
a
severability
provision
in
the
original
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
the
act
of
1970
is
inform
an
amendment
of
that
act.
whether
that
severability
provision
which
in
the
amended
act
will
appear
only
in
title
i
is
applicable
to
all
three
titles
or
not,
is
a
nice
question.
i
would
suppose
that
they
were
severable
simply
as
a
matter
of
my
own
personal
judgment
because
they
are
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
are
separate
ideas,
neither
one
of
which
is
in
any
particular
way
dependent
upon
the
existence
or
non
existence
of
the
other.
i
think
if
you
have
got,
when
we
come
to
the
residency
problems
in
the
cases
which
follow,
we
will
find
that
there
really
are
three
different
ones
there
and
should
the
court
find
that
one
of
those
is
valid
but
others
aren't,
there
might
be
some
intricate
questions
of
detail,
but
i
think
i
would
take
the
position,
though
it
has
not
been
covered
in
our
brief
that
the
statutory
provisions
are
severed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
as
mr.
justice
as
i
recall
it
there
is
a
general
severability
provision
back
in
title
i
somewhere
that
could
be
cited
if
the
court
felt
that
they
ought
to
be
held
to
be
severable.
i
don't
know
that
severability
is
focused
on
in
the
legislative
history,
it
is
perfectly
plain
that
the
several
things
were
discrete
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
were
not
interdependent.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
do
not
think
so
mr.
chief
justice.
i
will
ask
my
associates
to
check
through
and
advice
me
if
i
am
wrong
about
that.
there
was
just
no
focus
on
severability.
the
constitutional
validity
of
this
act
of
congress,
fixing
the
voting
age
at
18
years
on
a
nationwide
basis,
acting
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
i
find,
may
i
please
the
court,
that
last
week
i
constantly
referred
to
section
4
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
that
was
wrong,
it's
still
section
5.
the
constitution
of
this
provision
is
firmly
based
i
think
on
a
series
of
fairly
recent
decisions
of
this
court.
no
one
of
them
deals
with
this
issue
by
itself,
but
taking
together
they
seem
to
me
to
found
a
very
substantial
argument
that
this
statute
is
a
valid
exercise
of
the
power,
expressly
given
to
congress
by
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
this
can
best
be
shown
i
think
by
taking
up
these
cases
one-by-one
and
using
them
as
building
blocks
to
the
ultimate
conclusion.
there
are
roots
in
the
past
of
course,
but
the
first
of
the
cases
i
wish
to
mention
now
is
lassiter
against
northampton
county
board
of
elections
in
360
u.s.
that
case
upheld
in
the
absence
of
any
acts
of
congress,
the
validity
of
the
virginia
literacy's
test
as
a
proper
exercise
of
state
power
under
article
i,
section
2
of
the
constitution.
and
in
reaching
that
result,
the
court
said
at
page
51
of
360
u.s.
“the
right
of
suffrage
is
subject
to
the
imposition
of
state
standards
which
are
not
discriminatory
and
which
do
not
contravene
any
restriction
that
congress,
acting
pursuant
to
its
constitutional
powers,
has
imposed.”
now
i
suppose
that
analytically
that
sentence
is
a
truism,
but
it
does
indicate
that
the
court
considers
that
congress
had
constitutional
powers
under
which
it
could
impose
restrictions.
it
states
the
proposition
for
which
i
stand
here
and
it
is
i
believe
completely
established
by
this
court's
subsequent
decisions.
the
next
case
to
which
i
would
call
your
attention
is
carrington
against
rash
in
380
u.s.,
decided
in
1965.
there
the
court
had
before
it,
a
texas
statute,
which
provided
that
a
serviceman
could
vote
only
in
the
county
where
he
resided
at
the
time,
he
entered
in
the
service.
if
he
entered
in
the
service
from
another
state,
he
could
never
vote
in
texas,
as
long
as
he
was
in
service,
no
matter
how
firmly
he
had
established
a
residence
in
texas.
and
the
court
held
that
statute
invalid
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now
that
is
simply
section
1,
the
basic
equal
protection
clause,
there
was
no
act
of
congress
involved,
and
the
important
thing
to
note
is
that
the
result
would
reach
under
the
equal
protection
clause
alone.
there
was
not
a
trace
of
racial
discrimination
in
the
carrington
case.
there
was
none
of
what
was
referred
to
in
one
of
the
opening
arguments
as
classic
fourteenth
amendment
objectives.
there
is
no
suggestion
of
a
foundation
of
power
in
the
thirteen
or
the
fifteenth
amendments.
it
is
a
voting
case,
and
it
arose
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
alone,
thus
establishing
that
that
clause
is
of
its
own
force
applicable
to
discriminations
in
voting.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
texas
statue
did
mr.
chief
justice,
yes,
and
the
court
held
that
that
classification
violated
the
equal
protection
clause,
although
there
was
nothing
racial,
religious,
ethnic,
nothing
of
the
traditional
historic
basis
of
the
equal
protection
clause
involved
in
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
this
would
apply
equally,
yes.
now
of
course
the
reapportionment
cases
could
also
be
cited
in
support
of
the
applicability
of
the
equal
protection
clause
alone
to
voting,
but
the
next
case
that
i
want
to
refer
to
in
the
series
i
am
putting
before
you
is
south
carolina
against
katzenbach.
i
am
doing
this
in
chronological
order,
because
it
seems
to
me
that's
natural.
that
case
involved
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
the
statue
drew
support
from
the
thirteenth
and
the
fifteenth
amendments,
and
what
was
important
about
the
case
was
the
scope
it
gave
to
the
enforcement
causes
of
those
amendments.
section
2
of
the
thirteenth,
and
section
2
of
the
fifteenth
amendment,
and
these
are
identical
with
the
power
to
enforce
given
to
congress
by
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
under
those
provisions
the
court
held
that
what
congress
had
provided
in
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965,
the
abolition
of
literacy
test,
was
a
constitutional
provision
and
i
point
out
that
this
is
almost
immediately
following
this
court's
decision
in
the
lassiter
case
where
the
court
had
held
that
the
mere
existence
of
literacy
provision
did
not
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
provision
of
section
1.
the
significant
difference
between
the
situation
here
and
in
the
lassiter
case
is
simply
that
congress
had
undertaken
to
exercise
its
power
under
the
enforcement
clauses.
it's
quite
clear,
as
i
have
indicated,
that
it
was
not
merely
the
enforcement
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
but
also
of
the
fifteenth
and
residually
i
think
of
the
thirteenth,
but
here
is
a
situation
where
congress
acting
under
its
power
to
enforce
provisions
of
the
constitution,
made
invalid
state
statutory
provisions
which
had
only
recently
been
held
to
be
constitutional
under
the
provisions
of
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments
themselves.
now
a
few
days
later
in
harper
against
the
virginia
board
of
elections
in
383
us,
that
case
proceeded
solely
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now
the
court
held
invalid
the
poll
tax
provisions
which
had
long
been
enforced
in
virginia.
of
course,
the
situation
had
racial
overtones,
but
it
is
again
a
case
involving
voting
where
the
court
proceeded
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
perhaps
the
court
could
have
proceeded
under
the
fifteenth
amendment,
but
it
did
not
do
so.
of
course,
the
statute
and
decision
were
broader
than
any
matter
of
merely
racial
discrimination.
they
barred
white
voters
who
had
not
paid
the
poll
tax,
and
proceeding
simply
on
a
racial
basis
would
not
have
achieved
the
result
which
was
achieved
in
that
case.
now
the
next
in
the
line
of
cases
is
i
suppose
the
one
of
greatest
importance
here,
but
i
do
want
to
suggest
that
katzenbach
against
morgan
does
not
standout
all
alone.
it
is
part
of
a
stream,
a
part
of
a
development
which
has
been
occurring.
katzenbach
and
morgan
is
in
384
u.s.
decided
four
years
ago.
it
upheld
the
constitutional
validity
of
section
4
(e)
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
that
was
another
instance
of
action
by
congress
to
enforce
the
fourteenth
amendment,
taken
pursuant
to
the
power
granted
to
congress
by
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
as
the
court
will
recall,
it
provided
that
persons
who
had
received
an
education
in
american
flag
schools
where
the
language
was
other
than
english
through
the
sixth
grade
could
not
be
barred
from
voting
on
the
ground
that
they
were
not
literate
in
the
equal
--
in
the
english
language.
there
was
nothing
to
indicate,
and
never
had
been
anything
to
indicate
that
the
new
york
statutory
provision
requiring
literacy
in
the
english
language
was
invalid
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
by
itself,
but
congress
made
it
invalid
by
section
4
(e),
exercising
it’s
enforcing
power
and
this
court
upheld
the
power
of
congress
to
do
so.
the
court
proceeded
solely
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
other
basis
for
the
basis
for
the
exercise
of
power
by
congress
were
advanced,
but
this
court
did
not
rely
on
them.
the
case
did
have
ethnic
overtones,
but
the
carrington
decision
had
already
shown
that
this
was
not
a
necessary
element
to
establish
the
power
of
congress.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
it
may
have
some
bearing,
except
that
it
was
not
in
any
way
relied
upon
by
the
court
in
this
decision.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
moreover,
i
do
not
suppose
there
was
any
evidence
in
the
record
that
all
of
the
persons
effected
by
any
means
were
persons
who
would
come
within
the
provisions
of
the
fifteenth
amendment,
preventing
interference
with
the
right
to
vote
because
of
race,
as
at
least
as
that
word
race
was
used
in
the
fifteenth
amendment.
so
i
think
i
would
conclude
that
the
fifteenth
amendment,
though
a
part
of
the
background,
really
has
nothing
to
do
with
it,
and
was
not
so
regarded
by
the
court
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
we
have
said
that
because
we
can’t
find
anything
very
conclusive.
you
can
pick
out
passages
as
you
so
often
can
in
legislative
history
would
support
one
side
rather
strongly.
you
can
pick
out
other
passages
which
seem
to
be
almost
equally
strong
the
other
way.
the
legislative
history
is
reviewed
in
the
concurring
opinion
of
judge
mckenin
in
the
court
of
appeals
which
we
have
printed
in
full
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
in
this
case.
and
judge
mckenin
comes
to
the
same
conclusion,
pointing
out,
among
others
things,
that
after
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
adopted,
congress
went
ahead
and
proposed
the
fifteenth
amendment
indicating
that
it
did
not
have
the
view
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
alone
solved
the
problems
in
that
area.
it
has
sometimes
been
said
that
katzenbach
against
morgan
provides
a
startling
accession
to
the
power
of
congress.
it’s
clearly
true
that
the
full
potentiality
of
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
long
unappreciated.
indeed,
congress
did
undertake
to
exercise
powers
under
section
5,
shortly
after
the
amendment
was
adopted,
but
the
immediately
ensuing
decisions
of
this
court
were
not
such
as
to
encourage
further
experimentation.
perhaps,
it
was
a
sleeping
giant,
but
there
it
is,
and
it
has
been
there
for
more
than
a
century.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
not
such
an
innovation,
that
is
the
bringing
of
it
to
life.
the
eighteenth
amendment
had
a
similar
enforcement
clause.
in
katzenbach
against
morgan,
the
court
cited
james
everard
breweries
against
day.
you
will
recall
that
the
eighteenth
amendment
forbade
the
use
of
alcoholic
liquor
for
beverage
purposes
that
this
language
quoted
from
the
eighteenth
amendment
for
beverage
purposes.
in
the
statute
involved
in
the
james
everard
breweries,
congress
enacted
a
statute
under
it’s
power
to
enforce
the
eighteenth
amendment,
which
forbade
the
use
of
malt
liquors
for
medicinal
purposes.
now
the
amendment
gave
congress
no
power
over
the
use
of
liquor
for
medicinal
purposes,
acceptance
so
far
is
the
power
to
enforce
the
eighteenth
amendment
was
involved.
and
in
the
james
everard
breweries
case,
the
court
upheld
the
constitutional
validity,
and
discussed
the
scope
of
the
enforcing
clause,
saying
that
it
was
comparable
to
the
powers
given
to
congress
by
the
necessary
and
proper
clause,
which
too
i
think
were
in
a
sense
a
sleeping
giant,
not
until
they
were
utilized
by
congress
and
shall
i
say,
encouraged
by
the
famous
language
of
chief
justice
marshall
with
respect
to
the
scope
of
the
necessary
and
proper
clause,
was
it
fully
realized
how
far
congress
could
go
under
that.
similarly,
congress
has
no
explicit
power
under
the
constitution
to
regulate
intrastate
commerce,
but
the
shreveport
case
found
that
power
in
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
when
it
is
necessary
to
make
congress’s
power
over
interstate
commerce
effective.
more
recent
instance
of
the
same
exercise
of
power
is
found
in
united
states
against
derby,
and
in
many
decisions
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
the
national
labor
relations
act.
and
then
more
recently
in
association
with
south
carolina
against
katzenbach,
there
is
the
case
of
katzenbach
against
mcclung,
decided
5
years
ago.
likewise,
arising
under
the
commerce
clause
and
upholding
the
exercise
of
the
power
of
congress
to
provide
equal
accommodations
in
local
restaurants
as
an
exercise
of
necessary
and
proper
power
to
regulate
interstate
commerce.
one
other
case
here
to
which
i
would
like
to
make
reference,
williams
against
rhodes,
decided
just
2
years
ago,
is
an
election
case
where
the
court
proceeded
solely
under
the
equal
protection
clause
to
strike
down
provisions
of
state
voting
laws
which
it
found
discriminatory.
this
decision
along
with
carrington
and
rash
are
enough
it
seems
to
me
to
answer
the
suggestion
that
article
i,
section
2
of
the
constitution
provides
the
states
with
exclusive
power
in
this
area.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
it
was
decided
under
the
--
i
think
it
can
be
said,
under
the
thirteenth,
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendment,
but
certainly
under
the
fifteenth
amendment.
now
there
are
two
more
recent
cases.
kramer
against
union
school
district,
decided
last
year
in
395
u.s.
involved
a
new
york
statutory
provision
under
which
a
childless
person
who
did
not
either
own
real
property
or
rent
real
property
was
not
allowed
to
vote
in
local
school
elections.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
which
one?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
yes,
the
city
--
those
were
bond
election
cases
as
i
recall
it,
and
there
are
--
i
don't
think
i
have
undertaken
to
cite
every
case
that
has
some
bearing
on
it.
i
think
that
i
would
regard
as
cumulative,
and
would
take
whatever
support
i
can
get
from
it.
it
is
cited
on
page
33
of
our
brief
in
the
arizona
idaho
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
oh,
no,
mr.
justice,
i
don't
think
we
would
have
any
ground
to
stand
on
at
all,
if
we
didn't
have
section
5.
just
as
in
katzenbach
against
morgan,
the
english
language
literary
requirement
was
by
common
consent,
not
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
standing
alone,
but
when
congress
acting
under
section
5
made
it
–
when
congress
acting
section
5
decided
that
it
must
be
made
invalid
in
order
adequately
to
enforce
the
fourteenth
amendment,
this
court
upheld.
i've
just
referred
to
the
kramer
case.
i
don't
really
suppose
that
for
our
purposes
that
adds
anything
to
carrington
and
rash.
it
is
simply
another
case
holding
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
applicable
to
the
--
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
applicable
to
what
might
be
called
detailed
discriminations
in
voting
rights.
i
say
detailed
discriminations,
to
distinguish
it
from
ethnic,
religious,
no
negroes
can
vote,
provisions
of
that
kind.
and
then
most
recently,
and
in
some
ways
it
seems
to
me
of
the
greatest
importance,
i
am
sure
that
when
we
were
working
on
the
case
last
spring
in
my
office,
we
did
not
realize
its
significance
with
respect
to
this
problem,
but
is
the
decision
last
june
in
evans
against
cornman,
398
u.s.
that
case
involved
a
statute
of
the
state
of
maryland
under
which
residence
of
federal
enclaves
in
maryland,
in
this
particular
instance,
the
national
institute
of
health,
were
not
allowed
to
vote.
there
was
a
good
deal
of
uncertainty
in
history,
and
not
merely
the
history
of
this
particular
area,
but
also
the
whole
history
of
the
treatment
by
this
court
and
of
the
government
of
federally
owned
property
within
the
states.
it
was
found
for
example
that
residence
of
this
enclave
got
certain
benefits,
and
were
subject
to
certain
burdens,
on
the
other
hand,
they
did
not
pay
taxes
to
the
state
of
the
--
did
not
pay
real
estate
taxes
to
the
state
of
maryland,
and
insofar
as
they
were
renters,
they
did
not
pay
indirectly
to
the
state
of
maryland.
on
the
other
hand,
they
sent
their
children
to
maryland
schools.
if
they
wanted
to
adopt
a
child,
they
did
it
in
maryland
courts.
if
they
wanted
a
divorce,
they
did
it
in
maryland
courts,
and
questions
about
that
had
not
in
recent
years
been
raised.
now
in
evans
and
cornman,
like
kramer
and
like
carrington
and
rash,
were
solely
and
simply
equal
protection
cases.
they
are
cases
saying
that
specialized
discrimination
with
respect
to
voting
are
barred
by
the
equal
protection
clause
alone.
in
evans
and
cornman,
i
note,
was
as
it
appears
in
the
book
say,
unanimous
decision,
at
least
no
dissenting
votes
were
stated
and
so
we
have
two
lines
of
cases.
one,
a
series
of
cases
holding
that
state
control
of
voting
rights
is
subject
to
the
equal
protection
clause,
even
though
there
is
no
racial
or
ethnic
or
religious
basis
of
discrimination,
even
though
it
doesn't
come
within
the
classic
historical
foundation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
leading
cases
on
this
are
carrington
against
rash,
kramer
against
the
union
free
school
district,
and
evans
and
cornman.
and
then
we
have
a
second
line
of
cases,
that
the
enforcement
clauses
of
the
fourteenth
and
the
fifteenth
amendments
give
congress
powers
analogous
to
the
necessary
and
proper
clauses,
and
on
that
i
would
cite
three
cases,
katzenbach
against
mcclung,
which
involved
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
itself
with
respect
to
the
commerce
power.
south
carolina
against
katzenbach,
which
involves
the
enforcing
clauses
of
the
thirteenth,
fourteenth,
and
fifteenth
amendments,
and
katzenbach
against
morgan
on
which
the
court
relied,
and
i
think
could
only
have
relied
to
achieve
the
result
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
alone,
and
not
on
the
fifteenth
amendment
enforcing
clause.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
we
have
in
our
brief
at
two
places,
but
particularly
i
would
call
your
attention
to
pages
74
to
75
at
the
very
close
of
our
brief.
there
is
also
some
reference
to
it
in
the
introductory
portion
on
page
35,
i
believe,
and
there
is
further
reference
to
it
in
our
brief
in
this
case,
which
as
i
have
indicated
is
in
fact
our
reply
brief.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
would
say
that
it
does?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
not
mr.
justice,
though
i
think
maybe
i
would
have
almost
to
read
it
line
by
line.
there
is
that
rather
puzzling
provision
in
the
very
same
clause
as
article
i,
section
2,
which
says
that
the
state
shall
establish
voting
qualifications,
but
that
congress
can
make
or
change
provisions
with
respect
to
the
time,
manner,
and
place
of
holding
elections.
what
manner
means,
i
don't
know.
manner,
i
should
think
at
least
would
mean,
it
must
be
a
secret
ballot,
and
should
a
state
make
a
provision
that
negroes
will
vote
in
the
morning
and
white
people
in
the
afternoon,
which
i
don't
suppose
would
violate
the
fifteenth
amendment,
i
can
conceive
that
congress
would
have
power
under
that
provision
to
make
that
invalid.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
is
some
suggestion
in
the
cases
and
in
the
briefs
that
presidential
elections
are
peculiarly
federal,
that
the
right
to
vote
in
them
is
an
inherent
right
of
federal
citizenship,
and
that
congress
would
have
power
perhaps
under
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
to
make
provisions
with
respect
to
voting
in
federal
elections,
and
that
does
become
somewhat
relevant
in
the
cases
which
we
will
argue,
except
for
what
i
would
called
fringe
situations.
i
think
i
would
agree
with
you
that
but
for
the
fourteenth
amendment,
in
the
cases
i
have
already
cited
and
specifically
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
qualifications
to
vote
would
be
exclusively
a
state
matter.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
of
course,
the
fifteenth
and
seventeenth
or
nineteenth
--
seventeenth
and
nineteenth
amendments
have
limited
the
power
of
the
states
of
the
original
constitution
or
of
the
constitution
through
the
civil
war,
i
would
agree.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
with
hindsight
on
the
basis
of
my
argument,
the
fifteenth
amendment
could
have
been
done
by
statute,
except
that
congress
could
have
repealed
the
statute.
similarly
the
nineteenth
amendment
could
have
been
done
by
statute,
except
that
congress
could
have
repealed
the
statute.
both
of
those
are
now,
and
i
think
fortunately
are
firmly
fixed
in
the
constitution,
and
are
not
merely
a
matter
of
statutory
provision.
whereas,
the
provision
with
respect
to
literacy,
it
maybe
much
wiser
to
have
them,
so
that
they
can
be
modified
at
some
later
time
by
statutory
enactment,
and
it
may
well
be
true
with
respect
to
the
voting
age.
we
may
find
for
some
reason
or
other,
that
eighteen
doesn't
work
out,
and
the
congress
may
find
it
appropriate
to
repeal
that
statute,
and
the
states
will
then
have
that
much
greater
leeway.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
is
the
footnote
10
in
the
katzenbach
against
morgan
opinion,
and
i
fully
agree
that
congress
could
not
by
statute
repeal
or
make
ineffective
restrictions
which
are
found
in
the
equal
protection
clause
itself.
but
i
would
have
no
doubt
that
congress
having
undertaken
to
enforce
the
equal
protection
clause
by
a
statute
passed
under
section
5,
achieving
a
result
which
is
greater
than
that
which
is
caused
by
the
equal
protection
clause
itself,
as
in
morgan,
as
here,
would
have
power
to
repeal
that
statute
by
which
it
had
undertaken
to
enforce
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
comes
from
section
5,
and
the
necessary
and
proper
concept
which
is
included
in
section
5
which
as
united
states
against
darby,
as
katzenbach
against
mcclung,
as
everard
brewery
shows,
enables
congress
to
go
beyond
that
which
is
formally
prohibited
by
the
constitution
itself.
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
consequence
of
this
court,
not
merely
--
it's
widely
suggested
that
katzenbach
against
morgan
is
some
sport
that
suddenly
rose
out,
nobody
expected
it,
but
actually
it
has
a
very
sound
foundation
in
our
constitutional
history
in
various
areas,
and
it
goes
back
i
suppose
to
the,
shall
i
say
the
discovery
of
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
by
chief
justice
marshall,
or
at
least
the
adumbration
of
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
by
chief
justice
marshall.
now
where
is
the
discrimination
here?
doesn't
a
line
have
to
be
drawn
some
place?
of
course,
a
line
has
to
be
drawn.
the
question
is,
whether
congress
can
draw
the
line?
persons
who
are
18
to
20
years
old
are
a
class,
a
group.
it's
obvious
enough
that
they
have
interest
which
are
not
always
represented
by
older
citizens.
you
can't
brush
this
off
simply
by
saying,
well
18
to
20-year
olds
are
just
the
typical
of
everybody
else
in
the
community.
on
that
basis
you
could
have
a
statute
passed
by
a
state
which
would
say
that
only
citizens
whose
names
begin
with
g
will
be
entitled
to
vote,
they're
fair
sample,
and
it
will
be
a
lot
cheaper
to
conduct
elections
on
that
basis,
and
so
we'll
proceed
that
way,
and
that
obviously
would
be
invalid.
but
why
18?
well,
i
was
troubled
by
this
for
quite
a
while,
but
i
finally
resolved
it
in
my
own
mind,
in
a
way
which
at
least
came
to
me
to
be
fairly
clear.
now
suppose
a
state
said
that
no
one
under
40
could
vote,
or
that
no
one
over
65
could
vote.
if
one
looks
only
at
article
i,
section
2,
a
state
could
do
that.
perhaps
this
court
could
strike
it
down
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
but
on
that
basis
the
court
would
have
eventually
to
draw
the
line,
the
state
next
year
would
come
up
and
pass,
nobody
under
39,
and
then
nobody
under
38,
but
can
there
be
any
doubt
that
congress
could
pass
a
statute
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
to
enforce
the
equal
protection,
clause
which
would
invalidate
statute
such
as
i
have
suggested.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
what
i
am
suggesting
is
mr.
justice,
mr.
chief
justice
is,
that
congress
could
under
section
5
undoubtedly
invalidate
such
a
provision,
but
once
you
accept
that,
is
it
not
clear
that
congress
has
power
to
fix
the
line,
as
an
inescapable
element
of
its
power
to
enforce
the
fourteenth
amendment?
otherwise,
the
court
would
have
to
be
passing
on
a
succession
of
the
statutes,
and
finally
fixing
the
line
itself,
and
this
is
peculiarly
the
kind
of
line
which
it
seems
to
me
that
congress
is
better
qualified
to
fix,
than
this
court
is.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
on
that
mr.
chief
justice,
i
am
tempted
to
fall
back
on
justice
holmes'
dictum
with
respect
to
the
power
to
tax
is
the
power
to
destroy,
but
the
power
to
tax
is
not
the
power
to
destroy,
while
this
court
sits.
if
you'd
made
it
5,
i
would
act
with
considerable
confidence
on
them.
ten
probably
so,
12,
13,
14,
if
congress
actually
that
is
its
judgment,
that
that
is
what
it
should
do,
which
i
find
it
hard
to
contemplate
their
doing.
undoubtedly,
there
is
a
point
beyond
which
congress
could
not
go,
because
it
would
not
be
a
bona
fide
legitimate
exercise
of
the
power
to
enforce
the
anti-discrimination
provision
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
except
that
i
think
the
congress
has
power
to
do
it,
at
least
down
to
the
age
of
18,
and
i
don't
run
into
the
problem
which
you
raise,
which
is
a
problem,
until
congress
has
gone
a
good
yield
further
than
it
has
now.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
i
think
that
you
would
be
required
to
do
that
under
your
decisions,
that's
exactly
what
happened
with
respect
to
literacy.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice,
the
language
of
that
the
court
has
used
is
perceive
a
basis,
and
i
don't
think
this
a
matter
of
building
a
record
like
in
a
court
case
where
you
have
to
have
evidence
to
support
each
finding
of
the
court.
but
there
would
have
to
be
either
findings
by
congress,
or
legislative
history
which
would
provide
material
from
which
this
court
could
perceive
a
basis
for
what
congress
has
done.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice,
you
would
be
saying
that
though
this
is
not
a
violation
of
equal
protection
as
prescribed
by
section
1
of
the
constitution,
it
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
congress
can
do
if
in
its
judgment
it
thinks
it
is
necessary
in
order
to
enforce
the
equal
protection
clause.
just
as
the
power
to
regulate
intrastate
commerce,
never
given
by
the
constitution
to
congress,
is
frequently
upheld
by
this
court
as
an
inherent
--
as
a
proper
exercise
of
power
under
the
necessary
improper
clause
to
enforce
the
power
of
congress
to
regulate
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
don't
want
to
overstate
it.
i
think
it
is
a
very
close
question.
i
think
it
is
much
more
delicate,
shall
i
say
here,
than
in
the
commerce
situation,
because
there
you
can
--
at
least
we
have
a
long
tradition
that
the
intrastate
commerce
has
an
effect
on
interstate
commerce,
but
i
think
that
that
bridge
was
really
passed
in
katzenbach
against
morgan,
where
there
was
no
suggestion
that
the
discrimination
against
foreign
language
schools
was
invalid
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
no
one
had
ever
held
that
it
was
invalid,
indeed
in
the
case
immediately
following,
although
it's
complicated
by
the
fact
that
the
statute
was
passed
by
congress,
the
question
arose
with
simply
as
an
attack
on
the
new
york
court
on
the
new
york
statute,
and
this
court
found
it
invalid
not
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
but
under
section
5
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
pursuant
to
the
power
of
congress
to
enforce.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice,
i
don't
think
for
example,
that
the
decision
by
itself
without
any
act
of
congress
would
be
applicable
to
children's
rule
who
had
to
stay
in
hawaii,
and
studied
only
in
hawaiian
language
schools,
or
to
children
who
in
this
country
for
one
reason
or
another
had
studied
only
in
german
language
or
some
other
language
schools.
it
does
apply
to
spanish
language
schools,
and
thus
might
be
applicable
perhaps
in
parts
of
texas,
if
there
were
such
schools.
they
are
not
state
schools
in
texas
which
are
not
in
english,
but
there
might
be
private
schools.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
suppose
that
section
2
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
the
most
abortive
provision
which
still
remains
in
the
amendment.
it
would
seem
a
little
odd
to
me
that
the
only
effect
that
has
ever
had
in
american
history,
would
be
to
qualify
or
negative
the
power
expressly
given
to
congress
by
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
but
i
don't
think
that
there
is
anything
in
section
2,
which
in
anyway
qualifies
the
power
given
to
congress
by
section
5.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
i
suppose
that
it
might
as
a
practical
matter
had
a
deterrent
effect
from
having
an
age
above
21,
although
it
hasn't
been
enforced
as
to
its
other
aspects,
and
whether
as
a
practical
or
political
matter,
it
could
be
enforced
in
that
sense
by
reducing
representation
in
congress
if
states
went
above
21,
i
don't
know,
but
i
don't
think
that
there
is
anything
in
section
2
which
has
any
bearing
on
ages
less
than
21.
that's
too
strong.
it
obviously
has
some
bearing,
it's
stated
age
21,
it
certainly
reflected
the
understanding
of
the
time
that
that
was
the
current
voting
age.
i
do
not
think
that
it
can
be
said
that
article
i,
section
2
prescribes
21
as
the
voting
age
for
any
purpose.
for
example,
suppose
a
state
did
pass
a
statute
such
as
i
have
said,
nobody
under
40
can
vote,
under
article
2
they
might
lose
their
representation,
but
there
is
nothing
in
article
2
which
would
say
that
persons
between
21
and
40
can
vote,
because
of
article
2,
nothing
whatever,
because
article
2
says
21,
that
wouldn't
prevent
a
state
from
saying
you
can't
vote
unless
you
are
40.
the
only
think
that
would
prevent
a
state
from
doing
that,
would
be
the
equal
protection
clause
itself
of
section
1.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
would
say
background,
but
don't
know
about
backstop.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
to
issue
of
writ
of
mandamus
to
compel
congress,
to
reduce
the
representation
in
the
house
of
representatives?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
takes
me
aback
a
little
and
i
know
to
say
that
this
has
never
been
done.
i
suppose
that's
one
of
the
reason
why
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
but
states
did
on
a
wholesale
basis,
keep
people
from
voting,
contrary
to
the
provisions
of
section
2
of
article
14,
for
50-75
years
in
this
country
and
nothing
was
done
about
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
not
on
an
age
basis,
but
on
as
far
as
section
2
is
concerned,
that
it
was
equally
applicable
to
that
elimination.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
21
years
was
a
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
think
that
the
provisions
of
section
2
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
provides
an
inference
from
which
there
is
some
tendency
that
conclude
that
21
was
contemplated
as
the
voting
age.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
it
was
within
their
power,
yes,
i
have
no
doubt.
i
don't
suppose
anybody
has
ever
questioned
these
that
these
didn't
effect.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
twenty
one,
no
one
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
one
has
ever
questioned
that
21
as
fixed
by
the
states
is
a
perfectly
valid
provision
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
unless
and
until,
congress
undertakes
to
exercise
the
power
expressly
given
to
congress
by
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
enforce
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
i
think
that's
true,
and
i
am
sure
that
was
contemplated
when
it
was
written,
but
i
find
it
very
hard
to
find
very
clear
and
convincing
instances
of
things
which
the
states
can
do,
which
congress
cannot
change
with
respect
to
voting
by
action
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
it
must
be
recognized
that
the
power
of
congress
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
recognized
by
this
court
in
katzenbach
against
morgan
is
a
very
broad
power.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
if
congress
chooses
to
exercise
the
power
to
that
extent,
and
i
can
imagine
situations
where
that
would
be
very
important.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
i
can
imagine
a
bill
being
passed
by
the
house,
and
being
passed
by
the
senate,
and
going
to
conference
and
in
conference
it's
like
27½%
depletion.
we
got
that,
because
that
was
a
compromise
in
conference,
and
this
bill
might
well
have
turned
up
19½,
instead
of
18.
actually,
both
houses
of
the
congress
did
adapt
the
bill
at
age
18,
and
i
think
it's
not
irrelevant
that
the
key
vote
in
the
senate
really
on
the
issue,
whether
it
should
be
done
by
statute
or
by
constitutional
amendment,
was
64
to
17.
there
was
a
very
strong
sentiment
in
the
senate
that
it
should
be
done
by
statute.
when
it
went
back
to
the
house,
as
the
house
accepted
the
senate
amendment,
and
there
was
no
division
there.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
yes,
i
have
no
doubt
and
mr.
justice,
that
if
congress
finds
that
some
action
of
a
state
to
be
a
denial
of
due
process
that
it
could
pass
a
statute
within
considerable
limits.
the
chief
justice
has
forced
me
back
to
ten
years,
and
i
prefer
to
stand
on
five.
i
think
there
are
places
beyond
which
the
power
under
section
5
would
not
extend
to
voting,
and
i
suppose
at
some
point
this
court
would
have
to
decide
whether
a
statute
undertaking
to
enforce
the
due
process
clause
was
so
unrelated
to
that
objective
that
it
was
not
just
within
famous
language
of
chief
justice
marshall,
as
an
appropriate
exercise
of
a
necessary
and
proper
power.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
i
do
not
recall
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
conceivably
rational,
but
i
should
think
highly
undesirable.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we
are
going
to
have
a
federal
law
with
respect
to
this,
it
ought
to
be
nationwide,
and
that
would
apply
to
the
southern
tip
of
the
florida,
and
point
barrow,
alaska,
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
as
a
legislator,
and
i
can
find
no
difference
in
the
constitutional
position.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
these
cases
are
original
suits
brought
by
united
states
against
the
state
of
arizona
and
the
state
of
idaho,
both
arise,
as
did
the
previous
two
cases
under
the
voting
rights
amendment
acts
of
1970,
the
full
text
of
which
is
set
out
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
in
this
case.
it's
also
set
out
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
in
the
arizona
and
texas
case,
the
voting
rights
portions
are,
and
turning
to
page
78,
i
would
point
out
the
way
the
statute
is
put
together
after
what
has
now
become
title
i
which
extends
the
1965
voting
rights
act
and
also
steps
up
the
controlling
date
to
the
1968
election
in
the
alternative
and
not
in
place
of
the
previous
one.
then
we
come
to
title
ii,
which
extends
the
abolition
of
literacy
requirements
to
all
of
the
states.
that
is
involved
in
the
arizona
case,
number
46
which
involves
the
voting
age
requirement
too
and
then
in
section
202
of
title
ii,
we
have
the
fairly
extensive
provision,
dealing
with
residency
requirements
and
that
along
with
voting
rights
is
involved
in
the
idaho
case,
number
47.
as
mr.
wright
pointed
out,
there
is
in
section
205,
a
separability
clause,
it's
in
an
odd
place,
but
its
language
is
certainly
broad
enough
to
be
applicable
to
any
of
the
provisions
of
the
act
and
finally,
in
title
iii,
we
have
the
voting
rights
provisions
which
were
the
subject
of
the
argument
this
morning.
as
i
have
indicated,
both
of
these
cases
involve
voting
rights.
i
will
not
repeat
the
argument
which
i
gave
in
the
texas
and
oregon
cases,
but
i
do
have
a
few
supplementary
points
which
i
would
like
to
advance.
the
chief
justice
asked
whether
in
carrington
against
rash,
the
two
classes
were
not
identical
and
this
made
the
restriction
against
one
of
them
in
doubt.
i
think
i
can
respond
to
that
more
precisely
with
respect
to
evans
and
cornman
which
also
dealt
with
exclusions
based
on
residence.
there,
as
i
mentioned
in
my
argument,
there
were
differences
between
the
two
classes
concerned,
residence
in
the
enclave,
did
not
pay
real
estate
taxes
either
directly
or
through
their
rent.
they
were
subjected
to
somewhat
different
criminal
provisions.
insofar
as
they
were
subject
to
the
maryland
law,
it
was
pursuant
to
adapting
provisions
of
the
federal
statute.
the
issue
of
residence
involved
there
like
that
of
age
is
one
as
to
which
in
general,
there
is
a
substantial
state
interest,
of
course.
if
the
question
of
drawing
fine
lines
were
one
of
state
province,
then
we
would
have
expected
the
maryland
statute
to
be
upheld,
whether
people
are
maryland
residents
as
a
matter
now
in
law
which
seemed
to
be
in
the
first
instance,
a
matter
for
the
maryland
legislature,
but
we
think
that
the
court
was
right
in
that
case,
in
concluding
that
the
law
violated
the
equal
protection
clause.
in
the
cornman
case,
the
court
readily
could
conclude
that
the
basis
offered
by
maryland
for
the
distinction,
was
is
inconsistent,
was
insufficient.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
think
mr.
chief
justice,
the
court
decided
that
they
were
in
maryland.
the
court
certainly
said
in
its
opinion
that
it
was
within
the
external
boundaries
of
maryland.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
i
suppose
not,
but
i
think
the
court
must
have
decided
that
they
were
residents
and
citizens
of
maryland,
otherwise
they
couldn't
vote.
in
this
case,
the
court
alone
--
in
that
case
it
was
black
and
white,
either
they
are
in
or
they
are
out,
there
is
no
numerical
problem,
no
line
drawing
problem
and
the
court,
we
think
properly
held
that
they
were
in
maryland,
and
that
for
maryland
to
say
otherwise
was
not
supported
by
a
sufficiently
compelling
reason
to
take
it
out
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
in
this
case,
the
court
alone
might
not
be
able
to
reach
such
a
conclusion.
choosing
between
18
and
21,
requires
line
drawing
which
a
court
is
not
particularly
well
qualified
to
do.
congress
can
do
it
and
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
we
submit,
permits
it.
now
let
me
go
back
to
the
south
carolina
against
katzenbach
case
and
recall
attention
to
the
specific
provisions
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
which
was
upheld
there.
the
literacy
test
provision
sustained
there
had
a
trigger
provision,
fixed
by
congress
under
which
the
provisions
of
the
statute
went
into
effect
and
states
where
less
than
50%
of
the
possible
voters
had
registered
or
had
voted.
now
this
might
have
been
40%,
might
have
been
60%,
but
congress
made
it
50%.
this
figure
was
never
questioned,
if
congress
had
power
to
act
at
all,
the
establishment
of
such
a
figure
was
exactly
what
it
was
qualified
to
do,
better
qualified
on
the
whole
than
the
courts.
in
katzenbach
against
morgan,
the
statute
upheld
was
applicable
to
those
who
studying
in
american
flag
schools,
where
--
who
studied
in
american
flag
schools
were
spanish,
was
the
language,
had
proceeded
through
the
6th
grade,
not
the
4th
grade
or
the
8th
grade,
but
the
6th
grade.
i
think
this
court
might
have
found
it
very
difficult
to
decide
simply
under
the
equal
protection
clause
whether
the
4th
or
the
8th
or
the
6th,
i
can't,
it's
hard
for
me
to
think
of
the
record
which
would
really
support
such
a
determination.
in
both
of
these
cases,
congress
proceeding
under
the
enforcement
powers
of
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
drew
lines
and
fixed
exact
points.
this
is
the
kind
of
line
that
congress
is
well
qualified
to
draw
and
this
was
upheld
by
this
court
and
i
may
go
back
to
the
definition
by
congress
under
the
eighteenth
amendment
of
what
constituted
an
intoxicating
liquor.
some
of
us
recall
3.2
beer
and
i
guess
that
was
exactly
the
same
kind
of
a
line
well-drawn
by
congress,
perhaps
difficult
for
this
court
to
draw
pursuant
to
the
power
expressly
granted
to
congress
in
that
case
to
enforce
the
eighteenth
amendment.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
3.2
beer
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
was
excluded.
it
was
held
not
to
be
intoxicating
if
it
was
not
more
than
3.2.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
as
was
congress'
statement.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
court
decided
that
it
would
accept
it
and
i
suspect
on
the
basis
that
–-
well,
undoubtedly
on
the
basis
that
it
was
a
valid
law.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no.
i
am
not
sure
if
congress
had
passed
a
statute
saying
that
50%
spirits
is
not
intoxicating,
i
suppose
that
would
have
been
found
beyond
constitution.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice
i
suppose
that
if
court
would
have
sustained
an
act
of
congress
which
forbade
the
sale
of
anything
with
any
alcoholic
content.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
want
to
be
careful
to
not
to
jump
from
the
eighteenth
amendment
analogy
i
have
given
and
the
interstate
commerce
analogy
to
which
we
have
referred
and
the
fifteenth
amendment
one
to
the
equal
protection
situation
because
i
do
not
contend
that
congress
has
power
to
say
that
anything
which
this
court
had
held
to
be
a
violation
of
equal
protection
shall
henceforth
not
be
a
violation
of
equal
protection.
i
have
already
made
reference
to
footnote
10
which
in
the
katzenbach
and
morgan
opinion
which
represented
a
difference
of
opinion
in
the
court
and
i
stand
with
the
majority
view
that
the
power
of
congress
is
to
bar
actions
which
it
regards
as
denials
of
equal
protection
above
and
beyond
what
would
be
denials
of
equal
protection
without
the
act
of
congress.
that's
why
i
am
hesitant
about
as
entering
about
inclusion
and
exclusion.
i
also
said
this
morning
that
if
congress
does
extend
the
enforcement
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
i
think
it
can
thereafter
repeal
it's
extension,
but
i
do
not
think
that
it
can
repeal
a
decision
of
this
court
which
has
been
reached
without
the
effect
of
any
act
of
congress.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
because
the
constitution
itself
says
that
nor
shall
any
state
deny,
deprive
any
person
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
and
this
court
has
held
that
a
state
has
deprived
a
person
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws,
nothing
that
congress
does
under
section
5
can
be
an
action
by
congress
to
enforce
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it
can
be
an
action
by
congress
to
limit
the
enforcement
on
the
fourteenth
amendment,
but
not
to
enforce
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
have
-–
i
think
that
that
might
well
be
and
we
have
already
referred
to
that
and
specifically
the
virginia
literacy
statute
which
this
court
held
to
be
consistent
with
the
fourteenth
amendment,
was
thereafter
made
ineffective
by
the
act
of
congress
under
section
5
involved
in
south
carolina
against
katzenbach.
i
don't
know
that
congress
necessarily
decided
that
this
court's
decision
frustrated
the
fourteenth
amendment.
but
i
think
it
did
decide
that
under
all
the
circumstances
it
did
not
effectively
enforce
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now
let
me
turn
to,
first
to
the
case
of
united
states
against
arizona
and
the
literacy
problem
which
is
involved
there,
arising
under
section
201
of
the
statute.
under
that
provision,
congress
has
provided
that
any
test
or
device
which
is
a
phrase
taken
out
of
the
1965
act
as
a
prerequisite
for
voting
and
for
which
we
have
used
the
shorthand
of
literacy
and
requirement,
shall
be
invalid
in
all
states
of
the
country
to
which
the
trigger
provisions
of
the
1965
act
as
extended,
do
not
apply.
the
effect
of
that
is
that
literacy
requirements
are
made
invalid
throughout
the
united
states.
i
can
not
say
that
they
are
exactly
the
same
in
every
part
of
the
united
states
because
any
state
which
is
within
the
triggered
class
is
also
subject
to
further
provisions
under
which
it
can
not
make
changes
in
these
laws
without
either
the
approval
of
the
attorney
general
or
of
the
district
court
of
the
united
states
for
the
district
of
columbia.
those
provisions
with
respect
to
approval
are
not
applicable
in
idaho
or
minnesota,
they
may
be
applicable
on
one
county
of
arizona
and
they
applicable
in
alabama
and
mississippi
and
the
other
states
which
were
subject
to
the
1965
act.
so
the
question
is
as
to
the
power
of
congress,
seeking
to
act
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
other
provisions
which
might
in
this
case
include
section
2
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
even
section
2
of
the
thirteenth
amendment,
has
power
to
extend
the
abolition
of
literacy
requirements
to
the
entire
country.
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
the
way
the
argument
has
developed,
we
have
argued
the
most
difficult
case
first,
that
is
that
the
voting
age
requirement
raises
the
most
serious
intellectual
and
constitutional
problems.
in
my
own
view,
the
argument
with
respect
to
residency
is
a
fortiori
from
the
previous
discussion
and
the
argument
with
respect
to
literacy
is
a
multo
fortiori
from
the
previous
discussion.
we
have
here
an
express
determination
by
congress
that
literacy
devices
do
work
out
discriminatorily.
we
have
the
foundation
of
south
carolina
against
katzenbach
which
upheld
the
validity
of
the
1965
statute
and
more
recently
we
have
the
decision
of
the
court
in
gaston
county
against
the
united
states
which
held
that
merely
because
a
county's
current
practice
was
non-discriminatory
was
not
enough
to
take
it
out
from
the
1965
act.
if
the
continuing
effect
of
past
discrimination
in
education
continued
to
produce
persons
who
were
now
illiterate
and
who
would
be
barred
from
voting,
not
because
of
any
current
discrimination,
but
because
of
past
discrimination
that,
that
was
enough
to
sustain
the
continued
application
of
the
statute.
now
we
have
a
very
similar
situation
here.
it
is
not
suggested
that
there
has
been
past
discrimination,
at
least
within
recent
times
in
education
in
arizona,
but
it
is
very
clear
that
large
numbers
of
persons
have
moved
into
arizona
from
other
parts
of
the
country
where
they
have
been
subjected
to
educational
discrimination.
what
the
congress
has
done
is
in
no
sense
designed
to
punish
arizona
for
any
past
derelictions.
it
isn't
suggested
that
there
have
been
such
derelictions.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice
i
think
it
is
true
to
some
extent
with
oregon
and
idaho--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
to
an
appreciable
degree
and
i
suppose
any
person
who
is
illiterate
because
of
this
and
can't
vote
is
subjected
to
it,
besides
which
it
seems
to
me,
is
this
is
a
kind
of
thing
upon
which
congress
can
rightly
and
properly
adopt
a
national
policy
which
shall
be
effective
throughout
the
united
states.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
mr.
justice
there
--
mr.
chief
justice
there
is
complaint
by
arizona
in
this
case
that
congress
held
no
hearings
in
arizona
and
did
not
develop
the
facts
with
respect
to
arizona.
and
i
think
that
is
immaterial
because
congress
did
have
before
it
in
the
legislative
history,
extensive
material
as
to
the
movement
about
throughout
the
country.
it
is
perfectly
true
that
more
in
some
areas
and
more
to,
i
will
have
to
say,
in
big
cities
than
elsewhere
of
millions
of
people
who
had
been
subjected
to
discrimination
of
this
kind
in
the
past
and
congress
concluded
--
congress
and
its
members
were
well
aware
of
this
situation
and
could
properly
find
as
it
did
that
the
statute
could
be
based
on
the
enforcement
powers
under
both
the
fourteenth
and
the
fifteenth
amendments.
i
do
not
think
that
this
is
a
matter
which
has
to
be
separately
adjudicated
on
a
state
by
state
or
county
by
county
or
city
by
city
basis.
its
is
a
national
problem.
congress
is
our
national
legislature
and
undertook
to
dispose
it
on
a
national
basis.
this
is
particularly
referred
to
in
the
testimony
of
the
attorney
general
in
the
senate
hearings
is
on
pages
42
to
46;
where
he
dealt
at
some
length
with
the
house.
in
the
house
hearings
in
the
summer
of
1969
when
the
provision
for
the
extension
of
the
literacy
--
the
abolition
of
literacy
requirement
was
presented.
the
attorney
general
testimony
appears
on
pages
42
to
46
and
deals
with
the
matter
on
a
national
basis.
now
in
the
lassiter
case,
there
was
no
statutory
provision
under
section
5.
the
lassiter
case
holding
at
the
virginia
literacy
requirement
could
constitutionally
be
enforced.
here
we
have
an
explicit
legislative
provision
under
section
5
of
fourteenth
amendment.
there
are
i
think
as
up
to
date,
no
compelling
state
interest
justifying
the
imposition
of
literacy
test.
we
have
much
wider
dissemination
of
information
and
knowledge
about
political
matters
through
radio
and
television.
i
suspect
that
the
people
who
are
illiterate
that
numerically
speaking
far
more
get
their
information
on
political
matters
today
through
their
ears
and
through
television
then
they
do
by
reading.
most
states
do
not
have
literacy
requirements
and
never
had
had
them
and
some
few
which
do
have
them
do
not
enforce
them
as
to
which
i
understand
that
oregon
is
an
--
we
believe
that
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
extension
of
literacy
requirements
in
section
201
is
really
covered
by
south
carolina
against
katzenbach
on
the
one
hand
and
katzenbach
against
morgan
on
the
other.
so
i
will
turn
to
the
idaho
case,
number
47.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice,
not
with
respect
to
negroes.
i
think
that
there
is
some
suggestion
in
the
record
that
there
may
be
a
difference
with
respect
to
indians
in
arizona.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
not
with
respect
to
negroes.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
am
not
talking
now
about
some
what
remote
past
and
the
1870s
and
80s.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
people
come
to
arizona
in
substantial
numbers
who
are
illiterate
because
they
were
subjected
to
discrimination
in
the
places
where
they
were
at
earlier
times.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
legal
justification
i
repeat
is
not
punishment
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
is
not
retribution.
it's
simply
that
there
is
a
denial
of
equal
protection.
here
are
people
in
the
state
of
arizona
who
are
otherwise
qualified
to
vote
and
whom
arizona
will
not
allow
to
vote
because
they
are
illiterate.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
now
they
are
denied
an
equal
protection
today
by
arizona
because
arizona
won't
let
them
vote
today,
that
is
a
denial
of
equal
protection.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
reason
is
they
are
illiterate
and
the
reason
they
are
denied
the
right
of
vote
is
that
they
are
illiterate
and
the
question
simply
is
whether
that
is
such
a
compelling
interest
of
the
state
that
congress
can
not
properly
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
hold
it
invalid.
now
we
concede
that
it
is
inappropriate
interest
of
the
state.
we
concede
that
in
the
absence
of
action
by
congress,
a
state
could
make
literacy
a
test
as
many
of
states
have.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice
under
this
statute,
it
does
not
make
any
difference,
who
was
to
blame
for
the
fact
that
they
are
illiterate.
under
this
statute
the
mere
fact
that
they
are
illiterate,
no
matter
who
is
to
blame
or
on
what
reason
just
because
they
could
have
gone
to
school
but
were
lazy
and
did
not
go
to
school,
under
this
statute
they
can
vote
in
arizona.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
the
justification
mr.
justice
i
believe
is
in
a
sense
some
of
more
simple
than
that.
it
is
that
though
arizona
has
an
interest
with
respect
to
literacy,
this
is
a
matter
which
congress
can
pursuant
to
its
powers
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
regardless
if
this
is
the
origin
determine
is
not
sufficient
to
justify
the
discrimination
against
boarding
and
thus
the
denial
of
equal
protection
which
is
a
result
or
consequence
of
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
you
mean
in
arizona?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
the
indians
have
been
there.
indian
have
been
there
long
time.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
is
a
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
oh
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
indians
are
specifically
referred
to
in
the
hearings
and
there
is
evidence
that
a
much
higher
proportion
of
indians
voted
in
new
mexico
where
there
is
no
literacy
requirement
than
voted
in
arizona
where
there
was
a
literacy
requirement
and
there
is
a
considerable
basis,
discussions
in
the
record
that
one
of
the
reasons
whether
the
literacy
requirement
in
arizona
is
to
keep
the
indians
from
voting.
now
the
brief
for
arizona
does
show
that
under
mr.
justice
douglas'
interim
order,
requiring
that
people
be
registered
though
illiterate
on
a
separate
list
to
await
the
result
of
this
court's
decision.
i
think
only
21
persons
in
the
state
actually
were
registered,
although
the
record
had
shown
that
there
were
some
87,000
persons
in
arizona
who
were
barred
from
voting
on
the
literacy
requirement,
and
i
think
that's
a
disappointing
showing,
but
i
don't
think
it's
terribly
significant.
all
the
experience
in
the
deep
south
showed
that
you
got
the
people
to
register
only
by
fairly
intensive
voting
rights
and
indeed
it
was
not
very
effective
until
lots
of
people
went
down
and
gave
people
information
and
instructions
and
let
them
to
the
appropriate
places
and
after
a
while
when
fear
subsided
and
so
on,
and
more
people
got
out
and
did
it,
then
the
number
registered
greatly
increased.
and
i
suspect
that
if
this
court
upholds
the
provision
of
this
statute,
and
if
there
is
some
effort
to
register
people
in
arizona
who
heretofore
have
not
been
allowed
to
vote
that
a
very
substantial
number,
surely
not
87,000,
but
a
very
substantial
number
will
in
fact
register,
and
that
the
voting
rules
in
arizona
will
be
substantially
increased.
now
let
me
turn
to
the
residency
provision
which
is
applicable
with
respect
to
the
state
of
idaho.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
had
some
difficulty
in
finding
defendants
with
respect
to
the
residency
requirements
and
even
some
with
respect
to
the
literacy
requirements.
most
of
the
states
did
not
indicate
any
desire
to
contest
these
provisions.
the
residency
provision
is
really
three
provisions.
there
are
three
distinct
things
which
it
does
and
let
me
point
out
one
preliminary
matter,
it
relates
only
to
voting
for
president
and
vice
president.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
because
mr.
justice,
i
think
this
is
the
explanation.
with
respect
to
local
--
with
respect
of
other
elections,
like
governor,
even
congressmen
and
senator,
certainly
sheriff
and
district
attorney
and
all
of
those
things,
knowledge
of
local
issues,
knowledge
of
the
community,
being
a
part
of
the
local
community
is
relevant,
not
necessarily
controlling.
i
think
i
would
be
quite
prepared
to
defend
this
statute
if
congress
had
made
it
applicable
in
all
elections.
but
with
respect
to
voting
for
president
or
vice
president,
it
doesn't
make
the
slightest
difference,
barring
only
such
mechanics
as
arise
out
of
the
electoral
college
provisions
that
anachronism
with
which
we
are
still
bound.
it
doesn't
make
the
slightest
difference
whether
you
vote
in
arizona
or
in
new
york.
now,
it
is
true
that
as
far
as
i
know
we
never
had
an
election
in
this
country
which
was
determined
by
one
vote.
you
can
--
that
is
a
federal
election,
you
can
of
course,
assume
a
case
where
one
man
moved
from
idaho
to
new
york
and
voted
there,
and
that
was
enough
to
make
a
majority
in
new
york,
which
got
the
new
york
electoral
votes
than
the
fewer
number
of
idaho
votes
that
either
were
not
changed
or
went
the
other
way.
but
simply
in
terms
of
the
franchise,
congress
felt,
and
i
think
quite
understandably
and
rightly
so,
that
a
citizen
of
the
united
states,
who
is
resident
in
the
untied
states
ought
to
be
able
to
vote
for
president
and
vice
president
every
four
years.
that
is
the
-–
i
want
to
put
it
in
another
way
that
there
was
no
substantial
controlling,
compelling
reason
on
the
part
of
the
state
to
say
that
he
shouldn't
be
entitled
to
vote,
because
the
first
provision
here
is
that
if
you
have
resided
within
the
state
for
30
days,
you
can
vote
in
the
state
in
which
you
reside.
the
second
provision
is
that
the
state
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
we
still
have
it
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
oh
yes,
no
doubt
about.
it
is
filtered,
it
is
diverted
here
by
the
electoral
college.
the
statute
throughout
refers
to
vote
in
any
election
for
president
and
vice
president,
shall
be
denied
the
right
to
vote
for
electors
for
president
and
vice
president,
or
for
president
and
vice
president.
apparently
the
draftsman
of
that
provision
thought
there
was
some
hope
that
perhaps
we
might
eliminate
the
electors,
but
we
still
have
them.
i
think
that
if
we
didn't
have
the
electors,
i
think
i
could
almost
say
that
there
is
no
ground
whatever
on
which
a
state
could
oppose
this
provision.
it
would
be
a
little
bit
like
transferring
a
criminal
indictment
from
the
southern
district
of
texas
to
the
northern
district
of
arkansas.
it's
a
matter
of
convenience,
and
if
we
didn't
have
electors
and
we
simply
counted
the
votes,
then
the
only
interest
would
be
to
see
that
the
person
didn't
vote
twice
and
where
he
voted
wouldn't
make
any
difference
at
all.
now
in
addition
to
the
30-day
residence
limitation,
which
i
may
say
is
widely
in
effect
throughout
the
country
under
state
statutes,
the
act
of
congress
of
last
june,
also
provides
for
absentee
voting
and
absentee
registration,
under
fairly
short-term
provisions,
in
many
respects
different
from
provisions
of
some
of
the
states.
for
example,
some
state
say
that
the
absentee
ballot
must
be
received
not
later
than
noon
on
the
day
of
the
election.
the
federal
statute
says
that
it
shall
be
counted
if
it's
received
up
to
the
closing
of
the
polls
on
the
day
of
the
election.
then
finally
there
is
a
third
provision
which
purely
in
doctrinaire
terms,
perhaps
goes
the
farthest
of
all,
which
says
that
if
you
have
left
a
state
in
which
you
were
qualified
to
vote,
and
have
gone
to
anther
state,
and
have
not
resided
in
that
second
state
for
30
days
so
as
to
be
eligible
to
vote
there,
then
you
can
still
vote
in
the
state
from
which
you
came
and
of
which
you
are
no
longer
a
citizen,
and
you
can
make
a
complete
formal
argument
that
this
compels
the
state
to
allow
a
person
to
vote
for
president
and
vice
president
who
by
hypothesis
is
not
a
citizen
of
that
state.
and
yet
i
think
that
too
is
valid
although
it
pushes
it
further
simply
on
the
general
proposition
that
congress
was
concerned
and
was
rightly
concerned
that
every
citizen
of
the
united
states,
president
in
the
united
states
should
be
entitled
to
vote
for
president
or
vice
president
someways,
and
that
the
fact
that
the
exigencies
of
his
job,
or
simply
that
he
retired
and
decided
to
move
to
a
new
location,
or
problems
with
respect
to
his
family's
health
or
other
matters
had
required
him
to
move
just
at
the
crucial
time.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
--
well,
the
state
into
which
he
moved,
i
suppose
can
allow
him
to
vote,
in
which
case
i
believe
he
cannot
vote
in
the
other
state.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
i
don't
think
it
gives
him
any
option,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
either
he
can
vote
in
the
new
state
or
he
can't.
the
new
state
may
allow
him
to
vote
by
having
a
one-day
residence
requirement,
or
having
a
special
provision
for
people
who
move
in
from
another
state.
the
statute,
it's
on
page
81
of
our
brief
in
the
arizona
case.
“if
any
citizen
of
the
united
states
who
is
otherwise
qualified
to
vote
in
any
state
or
political
subdivision
in
any
election
for
president
and
vice
president
has
begun
residence
in
such
state
or
political
subdivision
after
the
thirtieth
day
next
preceding
such
election
and,
for
that
reason,
does
not
satisfy
the
registration
requirements
of
such
state
or
political
subdivision
he
shall
be
allowed
to
vote
for
the
choice
of
electors.”
now,
if
he
has
started
residence
20
days
before
the
election,
but
the
state
into
which
he
moves
says
you
can
vote
if
you
have
been
here
for
15
days
then
he
isn't
protected
by
the
statute,
he
would
have
to
vote
in
the
new
state
not
in
the
old
state.
under
this
statute
he
has
no
election,
he
can
vote
one
place
and
only
one
place,
he
can
vote
in
the
new
state
if
the
new
state
will
let
him,
and
if
the
new
state
won't
let
him
vote
in
the
new
place
he
can
vote
in
the
old
state.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice
i
believe
that
that
is
section
202
(i)
that
provisions
of
section
11
(c)
shall
apply
to
false
registration
and
other
fraudulent
acts
and
conspiracies
committed
under
this
section.
11
(c)
is
in
the
original
voting
rights
act
of
which
this
is
amendment
and
that
is
a
general
criminal
provision
for
criminal
act.
there
is
no
doubt
that
a
person
who
--
certainly
a
person
who
votes
twice
and
a
person
who
votes
for,
he
is
not
entitled
to
vote
will
subject
to
federal,
criminal
sanctions.
now
our
position
is
that
though
the
states
have
an
interest
and
we
don't
question
that.
the
states
have
an
interest
with
respect
to
literacy,
they
have
an
interest
with
respect
to
residency,
they
have
what
you
might
call
an
administrative
interest
in
terms
of
making
their
voting
procedures
not
too
expensive
and
in
such
a
way
that
they
can
effectively
guard
against
fraudulent
registration
and
voting
that
this
is
not
a
compelling
enough
interest
to
stand
up
against
the
exercise
of
power
by
congress
in
its
wisdom
pursuant
to
the
powers
granted
by
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
this
is
not
a
petty
matter.
it
is
estimated
that
5
million
people
are
barred
from
voting
in
this
country
in
presidential
elections
because
of
the
residency
requirements.
we
have
a
highly
mobile
population.
we
have
a
great
many
people
whose
jobs
are
with
big
companies
or
others
and
they
are
transferred.
we
have
the
people
coming
to
washington
and
going
from
washington,
not
presidential
appointees
so
that
they
may
have
a
domicile
here
in
washington
while
they
are
here,
go
back
to
their
states
and
the
aggregate
here
is
a
very
large
number,
something
like
3
or
4%
of
the
total
possible
voting
rules.
i
don't
say
that
this
will
increase
it
by
5
million
votes
because
not
all
of
the
5
million
people
will
actually
register
and
vote,
but
there
are
5
million
persons
who
will
be
made
eligible
to
vote
under
this
provision,
who
until
the
very
recent
past
have
not
been
so
eligible.
the
state
restrictions
have
been
loosening
up
in
recent
years
so
that
this
has
been
a
less
serious
matter
than
it
used
to
be.
there
is
no
real
argument
here
in
our
view
with
respect
to
administrative
convenience.
this
i
think
is
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
a
great
many
states
now
have
30-day
provisions
and
other
special
provisions
with
respect
to
the
election
for
president
and
vice-president.
the
states
will
have
to
change
their
statutes.
they
will
have
to
modify
their
practices
in
one
way
or
another.
the
fact
that
many
states
have
done
it
successfully
indicates
that
it
is
not
a
serious
matter.
now
indeed
four-fifths
of
the
state
which
is
40
states,
permit
registration
or
qualification
of
at
least
some
voters
up
to
30
days
before
the
election.
a
number
of
states
have
maintained
separate
rosters
for
presidential
elections.
the
situation
is
similar
with
respect
to
those
who
have
left
the
state
with
respect
to
absentee
voting
and
registration.
it
seems
to
us
that
decisions
of
this
court
in
carrington
and
rash,
and
katzenbach
against
morgan
are
applicable.
now,
i
have
discussed
section
202
mostly
with
respect
to
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
but
there
are
also
other
basis
which
can
be
relied
on
here.
this
supply
is
only
to
the
first,
the
foremost,
the
federal
elections
that
for
president
and
vice-president.
it
is
a
federal
event
with
respect
to
which
the
federal
congress
might
have
some
appropriate
voice.
it's
a
privilege
of
national
citizenship
or
at
least
it
can
be
contended
to
be
a
privilege
of
national
citizenship
to
vote
for
president
or
vice-president
derived
from
the
constitution.
it
is
one
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
of
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
analogues
to
the
right
to
travel
freely
among
the
several
states.
indeed
this
has
been
a
curve,
a
break,
a
restrain
on
freedom
of
movement
among
the
several
states
and
i
think
all
of
us
have
known
people
who
did
delay
they
move
until
after
an
election
or
who
were
very
concerned
because
they
couldn't
vote
because
they
had
to
move
before
an
election.
such
case
as
edwards
against
california
can
also
be
relied
on.
for
these
reasons
we
think
that
the
prayers
of
the
complaints
in
these
two
cases
should
be
granted.
that
a
declaration
should
issue
that
the
statute
enacted
by
congress
is
constitutional
and
that
the
state
should
be
enjoined
from
enforcing
their
statutes
which
are
in
conflict
with
the
federal
statute.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
first,
i
would
like
to
thank
mr.
mcgowan
for
correcting
the
figures
i
gave
as
to
the
number
of
persons
barred
from
voting
in
arizona
and
the
tiny
number
who
did
register
under
mr.
justice
douglas'
order.
i
was
speaking
from
memory
and
i
am
sorry
that
i
have
them
somewhat
inaccurate.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
couldn't
follow
the
discussion,
i
am
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice
because
the
statute
provides
that
the
ballot
must
be
received
by
the
closing
of
the
polls.
there
is
no
obligation
on
the
state
to
get
the
ballot
there,
the
obligation
is
on
the
voter
and
on
the
united
states
post
office
and
the
voter
ought
to
be
aware
that
he
better
allow
plenty
of
time
if
the
post
office
is
going
to
have
it
received
by
the
time
the
polls
are
closed.
if
the
ballot
is
received
by
the
time
the
polls
are
closed,
i
don't
see
any
burden
on
the
state
above
and
beyond
that
which
is
presented
by
the
voter
who
comes
in
five
minutes
before
the
polls
are
closed
and
cast
his
votes.
so
i
couldn't
follow
that
particular
argument.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
there
is
some
problem
about
following
up
here.
what
will
happen
in
some
cases
i
suppose
will
be
that
there
will
be
charge
of
sometime
made
that
this
man
voted
twice,
it
can
then
be
investigated
without
great
difficulty.
it
maybe
somewhat
hard
in
advance
to
prevent
dual
voting.
although
i
think
this
is
really
a
threat,
but
not
a
very
serious
matter.
time
may
come
when
we
will
have
electronic
checkups
by
social
security
numbers
and
things
of
that
kind
which
will
be
varied.
but
even
in
the
meantime
there
are
telephones
and
i
have
no
doubt
there
are
telephones
in
idaho
which
extend
to
a
great
many
places
where
it
won't
be
very
difficult
to
get
the
information.
in
this
connection
i
think
it
is
relevant
that
arizona
is
a
large
partially
populated
state
with
very
similar
problems,
mountains
and
desert
and
the
chief
proponent
of
much
of
this
legislation
was
senator
goldwater
from
arizona.
also,
i
think
it
is
relevant
with
respect
to
the
argument
of
arizona
about
the
literacy
requirement.
although,
senator
goldwater
was
primarily
interested
in
the
residency
aspects,
he
took
an
active
part
in
all
of
the
discussion
and
he
had
at
no
point
opposed
the
legislation
with
respect
to
literacy
on
the
ground
that
it
would
present
special
problems
in
arizona.
moreover,
it
was
suggested
on
behalf
of
arizona
that
the
problem
with
respect
to
literacy
in
arizona
was
due
to
the
default
of
the
united
states
in
not
providing
adequate
education
to
the
indians
and
if
that
is
true,
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
there
is
a
substantial
measure
of
responsibility
there.
i
assure
that
the
united
states
ought
to
be
able
to
take
steps
to
remedy
its
own
default.
with
respect
to
the
problem
of
persons
who
moved
into
the
state
of
arizona
who
had
been
discriminated
against
with
in
their
education
in
other
states,
this
was
specifically
pointed
out
by
the
attorney
general
in
his
testimony
both
in
the
house
and
in
the
senate.
the
gaston
county
case
was
expressly
relied
upon
by
him
and
by
others
and
it
was
never
effectively
countered.
the
--
in
the
senate,
there
was
never
any
committee
report.
there
was
a
problem
getting
it
out
of
the
judiciary
committee
and
it
was
taken
out
by
another
legislative
device
but
ten
members
constituting
a
majority
of
the
senate
judiciary
committee
and
this
is
printed
on
page
40
of
our
brief,
issued
a
joint
statement
which
it
seems
to
me
under
all
the
circumstances
can
be
treated
as
the
equivalent
of
a
committee
report
in
which
they
said
that
this
extension
of
the
suspension
of
test
to
areas
not
covered
by
the
1965
act
and
incidentally,
i
think
it
is
not
irrelevant
that
this
statute
does
not
invalidate,
does
not
nullify
state
literacy
test,
it
suspends
them
for
five
years.
they
said
that
this
extension
of
the
suspension
is
justified
for
two
reasons.
one,
because
of
the
discriminatory
impact
which
the
requirement
of
literacy
as
a
precondition
to
voting
may
have
on
minority
groups
and
the
poor
and
there
is
nothing
there
about
who
is
responsible
for
it,
where
it
happened.
we
are
going
to
make
them
be
good
because
they
were
bad
in
the
past,
is
simply
a
current
fact.
a
large
proportion
of
the
persons
who
are
now
illiterate
for
one
reason
or
another
are
of
minority
groups
and
of
the
poor
and
thus
the
literacy
requirement
has
a
specific
impact
on
them,
and
two,
the
joint
statement
continued
because
there
is
insufficient
relationship
between
literacy
and
responsible
interest
of
voting
to
justify
such
a
broad
restriction
of
the
franchise.
now
that
committee
and
the
congress
proceeded
to
view
the
problem
as
a
national
problem
and
to
legislate
on
a
national
basis.
now
what
the
specific
fact
is
in
a
particular
state,
whether
in
one
state,
it
is
a
more
serious
problem
than
in
another,
is
not
important.
the
objective
which
congress
had
in
mind
and
could
appropriately
have
in
mind,
we
believe
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
to
eliminate
denials
of
the
equal
protection
law
anywhere
in
the
united
states,
large
or
small.
in
last
analysis,
it
seems
to
us
that
these
three
problems,
voting
age,
literacy
and
residence
are
in
fact
very
similar
and
i
would
not
necessarily
say
that
they
must
to
stand
or
fall
together.
there
are
different
arguments
which
can
be
made
with
respect
to
one
of
them.
the
voting
age,
i
believe,
stands
only
on
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
whereas
section
2
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
other
provisions
can
be
brought
in,
in
addition
with
respect
to
the
others.
these
are
in
our
view
matters
which
lie
within
the
judgment
of
congress
pursuant
to
its
power
to
enforce
these
several
provisions
of
the
constitution.
suggestions
have
been
made
that
congress
might
go
to
extremes.
if
congress
goes
to
extremes,
that
will
be
another
case
and
it
can
be
dealt
with
and
this
court
is
still
sitting.
but
in
this
case
in
our
view,
congress
has
not
gone
to
an
extreme.
what
congress
has
done
is
an
appropriate
action
within
the
concept
of
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
as
established
by
chief
justice
marshall
a
150
years
ago
and
should
be
sustained
by
this
court.
