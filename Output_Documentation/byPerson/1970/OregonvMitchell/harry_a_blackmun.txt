mr.
general,
may
i
bring
you
back
though
just
for
one
follow
through
question?
despite
all
of
the
discussions
as
to
the
elimination
of
the
electoral
college,
we
still
have
it
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
and
hence
the
voter
does
not
vote
directly
for
the
president
and
the
vice
president.
he
votes
for
a
strange
animal
called
an
electoral.
do
you
think
this
makes
the
case
a
more
difficult
one
for
your
point
of
view
and
if
we
have
direct
election?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.

what
in

order?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
think
this
will
be
carried
out
in
the
future
if
the
application
of
the

to
arizona
is
upheld?
justice
