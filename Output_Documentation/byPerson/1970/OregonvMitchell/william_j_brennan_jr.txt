justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
professor
wright,
what
do
you
think
of
the
government's
suggestion
that
the
history
shows
of
those
references
as
to
age
21
and
section
2
had
a
particular
purpose
that
they
were
written
in
light
of
the
effort
to
assure
the
franchise
to
emancipated
slaves
who
otherwise
had
the
then
existing
voter
qualities?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
not
suggesting
that
there
is
at
least
some
ambiguity
at
this
time?
