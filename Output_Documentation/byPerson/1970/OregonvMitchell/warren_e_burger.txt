mr.

chief

e.

was
there
any
--
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
that
suggests
that
any
attention
was
given
at
the
time
of
this
last
action
of
the
county?
chief

warren
e.
burger
would
you
say
mr.

that
this,
in
the
carrington
case,
did
indeed
create
two
classes,
otherwise
the
same
in
all
respects,
but
one
entitled
to
vote,
and
one
not
entitled
to
vote?
chief

would
this
apply
to
him
if
he
were
22-year
old
master

a
brigadier

chief

warren
e.

the
city
of

phoenix?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
professor
wright's
response
to
that?
you
recall
his
response
to
that
point,
that
i
think
someone
suggested,
45
is
the
limit,
and
so
that
was
a
different
--
quite
a
different
matter
when
you
made
that
large
change?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
would
you
say
about
the
statute
passed
by
congress
that
made
the
voting
age
ten?
if
say,
if
they
can
draw
the
line
for
the
state?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
really
link
arms
with
professor
wright
in
your
response
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
haven't
commented
yet
i
think,
and
i
don't
recall
what
you
said
in
your
brief
about
the
essence
of
the
second
sentence
in
section
2
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
relating
to
the
penalty,
in
effect
the
sanction
on
the
states
for
denying
the
vote
to
citizens
under
21
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
think,
it
would
have
a
tendency
to
deter
the
states
from
having
this
abnormal
voting
age
you
discussed
earlier,
40
or
45,
will
it
have
any
deterred
effect?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
doesn't
this
forward
some
kind
of
a
backstop
to
it
though,
an
alternative
remedy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
about
situation
where
a
state
is
so
active,
and
it
were
demonstrated
by
the
evidence
that
this
deprived,
let's
say
one
half,
for
our
convenience,
one
half
of
all
the
voters
otherwise
and
previously
eligible
to
vote,
and
congress
took
no
action.
would
an
individual
in
suits
like
the
reapportionment
cases
be
able
to
get
the
courts
to
do
something
about
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
the
question.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
partly
because
no
states
have
ever
undertaken
to
fix
an
age,
40?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
not
on
an
age
basis
that
we
are
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
your
response
to
that
mr.
solicitor
general
be
the
same
if
congress
had
fixed
20
years
and
3
months?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
testimony
of
dr.
margaret
mead,
which
i
scanned,
but
did
not
read
closely,
was
there
any
cross-examination
of
her
or
other
witnesses
suggesting
a
difference
in
the
age
of
maturity
and
different
latitudes
as
a
rational
factor
for
people
to
take
into
account,
if
you
recall,
perhaps
you
don't
--?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
that
conceivably
be
a
rational
basis
where
we
could
perceive
under
the
language
of
morgan?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
solicitor
general.
i
think
professor
wright,
we
are
now
going
to
ask
you
to
split
your
rebuttal
in
two
parts,
unless
you
prefer
to
do
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
professor
wright.
i
think
we
will
recess.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
43
and
44
are
submitted
and
in
46
and
47,
mr.
solicitor
general
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
really
accurate
mr.
solicitor
general
to
say
that
they
are
in
maryland
or
that
they
are
in
an
island
surrounded
by
maryland
and
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
if
it
hadn't
been
for
the
on
play
factor,
it
wouldn't
it
be
necessary
to
be
so
circumspect
in
the
use
of
the
terms,
would
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
say
that's
true
with
oregon
and
idaho
also?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
a
substantial
degree?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that's
a
little
different
because
they
do
not
need
any
evidence
in
the
latter
situation,
do
they?
if
they
are
enacting
on
a
premise
that
you
just
suggested
then,
i
would
take
it
there
would
be
some
evidence
in
the
legislative
history
to
support
that
sort
of
a
finding.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
before
these
people
moved
into
the
arizona
for
example,
i
take
it
there
was
no
problem
because
there
were
no
class
of
people
or
group
voters
on
whom
the
present
statute
could
operate?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
in
arizona.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes
but
they
are
not
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
it
wasn't
the
source
of
this
legislation,
was
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general,
is
the
voter
given
any
option
under
that
last
section
that
you
mentioned,
the
option
to
vote
in
the
state
from
whence
he
came,
or
the
one
to
which
he
has
come?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
that
gives
the
voter
quite
a
choice,
doesn't
it?
obviously,
depending
upon
the
states
involved,
his
vote
would
have
far
greater
impact
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh,
then
i
was
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
this
statute
contain
a
kind
of
penal
sanction
for
voting
in
two
states?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
solicitor
general.
mr.
mcgowan
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
their
schools?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
english
language?
for
how
long
has
that
been
true
as
far
back
as
the
schools
go?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
is
a
gap
there
that
at
least
for
me
needs
some
explanation.
i
am
not
sure
how
relevant
it
is.
if
they
have
had
schools
for
a
100
years,
how
do,
what’s
the
explanation
for
the
illiteracy
in
english?
don’t
they
attend
the
schools?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
there
is
widespread
truancy
in
effect?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
not
sure
how
relevant
this
is
but
it’s
rather
surprising
gap
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
was
not
what?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
an
extraordinary
thing,
this
negative
response.
i
suppose
it
could
be
related
to
the
communication
of
the
information
about
the
order,
the
interim
order.
does
this
mean
that
this
is
open
to
an
inference
that
navajos
generally
don't
have
television
or
don't
have
radios
or
what
--
would
you
care
to
speculate
on
that,
though?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
it's
a
rejection
perhaps,
speculatively,
of
participation
in
the
affairs
outside
their
own,
navajo
nation
tribal
affairs?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
mr.
nelson!
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
attorney
general.
mr.
robson
--
mr.
attorney
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
record
in
this
case,
mr.
attorney
general
show
what
position
idaho's
representatives
in
two
houses
took
on
this
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
bring
all
these
practical
things
to
the
attention
of
the
congress?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
attorney
general.
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
have
i
think
13
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
have
if
you
care
to
comment
on
the
diversity
of
problems
which
the
states
must
meet,
which
the
attorney
general
of
idaho
has
just
commented
on.
mail
in
new
york
maybe
highly
efficient,
the
problems
of
registration
are
different
from
the
problems
of
mountainous
oral
stage.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
was
thinking
of
this
particularly
mr.
solicitor
general
in
the
realm
of
the
new
voter,
problems
that
it
tend
to
exchange
of
mail
for
example
to
check,
if
idaho
wants
to
check
on
a
new
resident's
vote.
i
suppose
it's
rather
a
complicated
business
to
find
out
from
the
old
voting
situs,
whether
the
man
has
in
fact
cast
an
absentee
ballot?
chief
justice
warren
e.

you
mr.
solicitor

do,
what’s
the
explanation
for
the
illiteracy
in
english?
don’t
they
attend
the
schools?
chief

warren
e.

you
mean
there
is
widespread
truancy
in
effect?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
not
sure
how
relevant
this
is
but
it’s
rather
surprising
gap
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
was
not
what?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
an
extraordinary
thing,
this
negative
response.
i
suppose
it
could
be
related
to
the
communication
of
the
information
about
the
order,
the
interim
order.
does
this
mean
that
this
is
open
to
an
inference
that
navajos
generally
don't
have
television
or
don't
have
radios
or
what
--
would
you
care
to
speculate
on
that,
though?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
it's
a
rejection
perhaps,
speculatively,
of
participation
in
the
affairs
outside
their
own,
navajo
nation
tribal
affairs?
chief
justice
warren
e.

thank
you.
mr.
nelson!
chief

warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
attorney

mr.

chief

e.

does
the
record
in
this
case,
mr.
attorney
general
show
what
position
idaho's
representatives
in
two
houses
took
on
this
problem?
chief

warren
e.

bring
all
these
practical
things
to
the
attention
of
the
congress?
chief
justice
warren
e.

thank
you
mr.
attorney

mr.
solicitor
general,
you
have
i
think
13
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
have
if
you
care
to
comment
on
the
diversity
of
problems
which
the
states
must
meet,
which
the
attorney
general
of
idaho
has
just
commented
on.
mail
in

maybe
highly
efficient,
the
problems
of
registration
are
different
from
the
problems
of
mountainous
oral
stage.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
was
thinking
of
this
particularly
mr.
solicitor
general
in
the
realm
of
the
new
voter,
problems
that
it
tend
to
exchange
of
mail
for
example
to
check,
if
idaho
wants
to
check
on
a
new
resident's
vote.
i
suppose
it's
rather
a
complicated
business
to
find
out
from
the
old
voting
situs,
whether
the
man
has
in
fact
cast
an
absentee
ballot?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
solicitor
general.
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
cases
are
submitted.
