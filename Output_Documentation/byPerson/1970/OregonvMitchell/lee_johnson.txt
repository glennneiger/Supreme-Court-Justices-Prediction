mr.
lee
johnson
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
original
action,
under
article
iii,
section
2
of
the
constitution,
28
u.s.c.,
section
1251
in
which
the
state
of
oregon
is
the
plaintiff,
the
defendant
is
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states,
john
mitchell
who
is
not
a
resident
of
the
state
of
oregon.
we
are
seeking
a
decree
that
title
iii
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1970
is
unconstitutional
and
enjoining
defendant
from
enforcing
this
title
with
respect
to
the
plaintiff's
state.
the
guts
of
that
statute
is
simply
in
section
302
which
prohibit
states
from
denying
the
franchise
to
any
person
over
the
age
of
18
who
is
otherwise
qualified
to
vote.
mr.
lee
johnson
we
are
not
challenging
that,
mr.
justice.
the
oregon
constitution
like
that
of
46
other
states
restricts
the
franchise
to
those
who
are
21
years
and
older.
i
might
add
that
in
may
1970,
the
voters
of
oregon
overwhelmingly
defeated
a
constitutional
amendment
which
would
have
reduced
the
voting
age
to
19.
there
are
some
points,
in
the
plaintiff's
argument
over
which
i
think
there
is
a
little
dispute
and
which
i
would
like
to
dispose
off
at
the
outset.
first
that
states
have
traditionally
determined
voter
qualifications
and
that
tradition
was
contemplated
by
the
drafters
of
the
constitution
in
article
i,
section
2,
dealing
with
the
election
of
representatives
and
article
ii,
section
1,
dealing
with
the
selection
of
presidential
electors,
and
was
reaffirmed
even
after
the
passage
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
it
was
reaffirmed
in
the
seventeenth
amendment
which
deals
with
the
election
of
senators.
secondly,
states
certainly
have
a
vital
and
legitimate
interest
in
restricting
the
franchise
to
responsible
persons,
and
age
is
certainly
a
relevant
criteria
in
determining
the
qualifications
for
voter
responsibility.
thirdly,
the
implementation
of
an
age
classification
inevitably
leads
to
line
drawing
and
reasonable
men
can
certainly
differ
as
to
the
precise
location
of
that
line.
i
think
also,
there
are
obviously
outer
limits,
over
which
reasonable
men
would
also
not
differ
that
the
line
was
not
reasonable.
fourthly,
while
legislative
wisdom
may
prefer
one
line
over
another,
no
one
can
seriously
argue
that
a
minimum
age
of
18
or
19,
or
20,
or
21
is
irrational,
irrelevant
or
invidious.
i
think
this
court
could
perceive
a
reasonable
basis
for
any
one
of
these
choices.
i
think
the
--
the
point
was
put
very
succinctly
by
professor
herbert
wexler
in
a
letter
to
the
president
which
appears
in
the
congressional
record
on
this
legislation,
in
which
he
stated
and
i
quote,
“age
is
obviously
not
irrelevant
to
qualifications
and
since
any
age
criterion
involves
the
drawing
of
an
arbitrary
line,
fixing
the
age
at
21,
most
certainly
this
is
not
capricious.”
i
think
that
there
will
be
considerable
dispute
over
many
issues
that
will
follow
in
my
argument
and
the
solicitor
general
will
raise,
but
i
think
really
the
issue
in
this
case
boils
down
to
one
point,
and
it
is
simply
this.
it's
whether
congress
has
the
power
to
substitute
its
legislative
preference
in
selecting
that
line
for
the
preference
of
the
voters
of
the
state
of
oregon.
of
course,
for
congress
to
exercise
such
a
legislative
mandate,
it
must
look
to
one
of
the
enumerated
powers.
the
defendant
concedes
that
the
responsibility
for
determining
voter
qualifications
is
at
least
primarily
vested
in
the
states
by
the
constitution.
the
defendant
rests
its
case
on
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
think
in
order
to
understand
section
5,
we
must
first
examine
section
1
of
that
amendment.
and
i
think
the
point
should
be
made
at
section
1,
standing
alone
is
not
an
affirmative
grant
of
power
to
congress,
but
rather
it's
merely
a
prohibition
against
the
states.
and
this
is
in
contrast
to
the
enumerated
powers
of
congress
such
as
interstate
commerce
that
are
enumerated
in
article
i,
section
4
of
the
constitution.
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
gives
congress
the
power
to
do
all
that
is
necessary
and
proper
to
enforce
the
prohibition
of
section
1,
but
the
test
necessarily
must
be
whether
the
power
exercised
by
congress
is
appropriate
to
the
enforcement
of
what
is
prohibited
by
section
1.
in
title
iii,
congress
and
the
defendant
have
attempted
to
obviate
this
test
by
bootstrap
reasoning.
first,
in
section
301
of
the
act,
congress
declares
that
requiring
a
citizen
to
be
21
years
of
age
in
order
to
vote
is
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
prohibition.
and
therefore,
it
is
necessary
and
proper
to
enforce
the
prohibition
by
preventing
the
states
from
denying
the
franchise
to
anyone
who
is
over
18.
secondly,
defendant
now
asserts,
the
judicial
review
of
congress'
findings
is
confined
to
the
single
issue
of
whether
the
court
can
perceive
any
rational
basis
therefore.
we
concede
that
the
perceive
a
basis
test
is
the
appropriate
test
of
legislation
under
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
embodied
in
section
5.
we
also
concede
that
it's
a
proper
role
for
congress
to
seek
and
identify
violations
of
the
equal
protection
prohibition.
but
there
is
still
one
defective
link
in
defendant's
chain
of
reasoning
which
destroys
the
connection.
we
submit
that
first,
that
the
perceive
a
basis
test
is
not
the
appropriate
test
for
judicial
review
in
determining
the
scope
and
the
meaning
of
the
equal
protection
prohibition.
this
is
a
determination
that
must
be
made
by
this
court,
exercising
its
independent
judgment
and
review.
secondly,
even
if
the
perceive
a
basis
test
is
applicable,
there
is
no
ground
in
this
case
for
perceiving
a
basis
that
title
iii
is
aimed
at
a
fourteenth
amendment
objective.
now,
the
defendant
relies
on
a
single
case,
katzenbach
versus
morgan.
i
am
sure
the
court
is
familiar
with
the
case,
but
to
briefly
reiterate
the
facts,
there
congress
enactment
had
prohibited
the
states
from
denying
the
vote
on
account
of
illiteracy
to
any
person
of
puerto
rican
ancestry
who
had
attended
six
years
in
an
american
school.
the
difficult
problem
in
the
case
was
the
literacy
tests
on
their
face,
certainly
are
not
invidious
or
irrational.
nevertheless,
the
court
and
we
believe
correctly
upheld
the
act,
because
it
and
i
quote,
“maybe
readily
seen
as
plainly
adapted
to
further
the
aims
of
equal
protection.”
the
court
in
its
majority
opinion
followed
two
rationales
in
reaching
this
conclusion.
first,
that
the
enhanced
political
power
would
or
maybe
helpful
in
gaining
non-discriminatory
governmental
services
for
puerto
ricans,
and
for
that
reason
the
court
could
perceive
a
basis
that
the
legislation
was
necessary
and
proper
to
ensure
equal
protection
of
the
laws
for
this
particular
ethnic
minority
group.
secondly,
the
court
could
perceive
a
basis
for
congress
ascertaining
that
the
new
york
literacy
test
was
being
used
as
a
direct
device
to
deny
the
franchise
to
puerto
ricans,
solely
because
of
their
national
origin.
under
both
rationales,
the
court,
and
again
we
believe
rightly,
defined
congress'
powers
to
determine
what
is
necessary
and
proper
in
the
broadest
terms
and
confined
its
review
to
whether
it
could
perceive
a
basis
for
the
congressional
determination.
but
contrary
to
the
defendant's
argument,
the
court
merely
confirmed
what
was
obvious
in
that
case,
that
the
object
of
the
legislation
was
plainly
adopted
to
furthering
the
aims
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
as
the
court
itself
said
or
recognized
the
practical,
the
sole
practical
effect
of
that
act
in
katzenbach
versus
morgan
was
to
extend
the
franchise
to
large
segments
of
the
minority
group
which
had
heretofore
been
denied
the
right
largely
as
a
result
of
their
national
origin.
and
of
course
state
action
denying
rights
to
the
minorities
because
of
their
race,
color,
national
origin
are
classic
fourteenth
amendment
objectives.
but
contrary
to
defendant's
argument,
there
is
no
suggestion
in
katzenbach
versus
morgan
that
the
court
was
saying
that
congress
had
not
only
brought
powers
to
fashion
remedies,
but
that
congress
could
indeed
determine
what
is
prohibited
by
sections
1,
in
other
words,
what
is
prohibited
by
the
equal
protection
clause
and
that
that
determination
by
congress
would
be
binding
upon
this
court.
defendant's
interpretation
can
only
be
supported
by
taking
isolated
sentences
from
the
opinion
and
reading
those
sentences
totally
out
of
context.
furthermore,
there
is
no
support
in
the
precedence
for
defendant's
interpretation.
defendant
cites
two
cases
involving
interstate
commerce,
but
those
cases,
the
issue
in
those
issues
was
not
what
is
interstate
commerce,
but
rather
what
is
congress'
powers
under
the
necessary
and
proper
clause.
in
all
of
those
cases
the
court
still
reserved
to
itself
the
ultimate
determination
of
the
issue
of
what
is
interstate
commerce.
i'd
like
to
suggest
that
if
we
follow
defendant's
rationale,
it
would
mean
that
there
will
be
hardly
an
area
of
state
legislation
or
state
law
which
congress
could
not
preempt.
because
as
this
court
has
many
times
recognized,
legislatures
must
make
choices
and
necessarily
must
make
classifications
or
if
you
like,
we
can
call
them
discriminations,
but
these
classifications
are
inherent
in
the
legislative
process.
section
1
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
prohibit
all
classifications
and
never
has,
but
only
those
which
are
irrelevant,
invidious,
or
irrational.
but
if
we
are
going
to
leave
to
congress
the
prerogative
to
determine
which
classifications
come
within
the
equal
protection,
then
congress
could
declare
almost
all
state
legislation,
declare
the
classifications
therein
as
a
violation
of
equal
protection
and
thus
be
within
their
scope,
so
that
they
can
preempt
the
states
and
render
your
state
legislatures
virtually
unnecessary.
but
as
a
practical
matter,
the
contraction
of
state
power
or
state
jurisdiction
under
defendant's
rationale
may
not
be
as
significant
as
the
effect
of
that
rationale
would
have
upon
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
in
the
first
place,
if
we
follow
defendant's
rationale
and
if
congress
can
determine
what
is
violative
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
then
by
equal
logic,
congress
should
be
able
to
determine
what
is
not
violating
of
the
amendment.
i
think
the
court
in
its
opinion,
in
katzenbach
versus
morgan
clearly
indicates
that
it
was
not
buying
the
defendant's
argument,
because
in
footnote
10,
the
court
indicates
that,
no,
it
is
reserving
to
itself,
to
its
independent
judgment
what
is
violative
and
what
is
not
violative
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
lee
johnson
my
only
response
to
that
mr.
justice
would
be
that
i
can't
see
how
you
can
reserve
it
one
way
and
i
go
both
ways
and
i
think
that
the
fact
that
footnote
is
there
--
mr.
lee
johnson
the
question
is
whether
--
i
think
really
the
question
is
whether
the
majority
opinion
goes
as
far
as
the
government
says
it
does,
and
i
think
one
of
the
indications
that
it
does
not
is
that
footnote.
mr.
lee
johnson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lee
johnson
i
think
that
the
legislation
would
be
on
a
stronger
basis,
if
it
was
limited
to
only
federal
officers
because
then
possibly
the
government
could
rely
on
its
general
preservation
of
the
federal
election
process
as
it
grounds
in
not
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
uphold
the
statute.
so
for
that
reason
i
would
say
that
it
would
be
a
different.
it
would
certainly
be
a
different
ballgame,
but
in
this
case,
they
have
rested
it
solely
upon
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
lee
johnson
right.
mr.
lee
johnson
i
think
it
is
possible
to
make
them
severable,
although
the
act
is
not
contained
in
severability
clause,
and
i
think
if
we
do
make
them
severable,
the
court
should
maybe
consider
the
very
definite
administrative
difficulty
that
this
would
probably
create,
and
maybe
it
would
be
better
to
refer
it
back
to
congress
because
if
the
states
are
put
in
a
position,
they
have
to
grant
this
franchise
to
eighteen-year-olds
in
federal
elections,
but
not
in
state
elections,
this
creates
a
tremendous
administrative
burden.
so
it
seems
to
me
there
would
be
a
real
question
of
whether
congress
actually
intended
that
the
statute
to
be
severable.
the
second
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
if
congress
is
to
be
the
interpretor
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
then
it
likewise
would
have
to
be
the
interpretor
of
other
sections
of
the
constitution.
for
example,
congress
could
not
only
determine
what
was
necessary
and
proper,
but
could
determine
what
in
fact
is
interstate
commerce.
congress
could
reserve
for
itself
to
determine
what
is
in
fact
a
constitutional
tax.
i
point
you
to
article
i,
section
8
of
the
constitution
which
says
that
“congress
shall
have
the
power
to
make
all
the
laws
which
will
be
necessary
and
proper
and
all
other
powers
vested
by
this
constitution
and
the
government
of
the
united
states
or
any
department
or
officer
thereof.”
under
defendant's
rationale,
congress
could
determine
itself
the
limits
of
the
power
conferred
upon
itself,
the
limits
of
the
power
conferred
upon
the
president,
the
limits
of
the
power
conferred
upon
this
court,
and
the
limits
of
the
powers
of
the
federal
government
as
against
the
state
subject
only
to
the
test
of
whether
this
court
could
perceive
a
basis.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we
follow
defendant's
rationale,
we're
doing
nothing
less
than
repudiating
the
doctrine
of
judicial
review.
we
submit
that
katzenbach
versus
morgan
does
not
go
that
far,
but
merely
holds
that
congress
has
broad
powers
to
fashion
remedies
to
enforce
the
prohibitions
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
the
instant
case,
there
is
no
equal
protection
objective
that
can
be
identified,
unlike
katzenbach
versus
morgan
which
enfranchised
a
minority
ethnic
group.
the
sole
effect,
the
sole
practical
effect
of
title
iii
will
be
to
enfranchise
any
person
who
is
between
the
age
of
18
and
21.
there
is
no
suggestion
on
the
congressional
debate
and
indeed
there
could
be
none
that
this
will
enfranchise
a
group
which
had
heretofore
been
discriminated
against
because
of
their
race,
their
color,
their
national
origin
or
economic
status
or
on
any
other
basis
that
could
be
classified
as
invidious,
irrelevant,
or
irrational.
now
to
some,
including
myself
personally,
it
would
be
desirable
to
extend
the
franchise,
but
legislative
desirability
is
not
the
test.
the
issue
which
this
court
must
decide
and
cannot
cede
to
congress
to
decide,
is
whether
restricting
the
franchise
to
those
who
are
21
is
so
inherently
unreasonable
to
be
irrational
or
irrelevant.
we
submit
that
21
years
of
age,
the
21
years
of
age
standard
employed
by
oregon,
46
other
states,
indeed
which
is
infirmed
in
section
2
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
deals
with
re-apportionment,
the
only
place
in
the
united
states
constitution
where
the
21-year
standard
is
mentioned.
but
this
is
certainly
an
affirmance
of
what
has
gone
for
many
years,
that
the
21-year
age
standard
is
a
reasonable
classification
even
if
it
might
not
be
a
desirable
classification,
it
is
a
reasonable
classification,
the
ball
is
far
short
of
the
prohibitions
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
feel
that
the
government
advances
the
argument
that
there
must
be
a
compelling
state
interest
and
advances
many
arguments
which
are
legislative
reasons,
not
constitutional
reasons,
but
legislative
reasons
for
extending
the
franchise
to
18-year
olds.
and
the
suggestion
is
made
by
the
government
that
great
deference
should
be
given
to
congress
because
they
are
better
at
this
line
drawing
exercise
than
a
court
gives.
we
suggest,
once
you
accept
the
proposition
that
a
line
has
been
drawn,
there
is
an
area
in
here
to
which
reasonable
men
differ
as
to
where
that
line
should
be
drawn.
but
the
decision
there
is
not
to
be
made
by
congress
because
the
constitution
contemplates
that
decision
as
to
voter
qualifications
would
be
made
by
the
state.
and
still
the
question
must
be
made,
must
be
the
only
question
is
whether
the
classification
that
is
made
by
the
states
meets
the
fourteenth
amendment
standards
of
being
invidious,
irrational
or
irrelevant.
for
these
reasons
we
pray
that
the
court
will
grant
the
relief
to
plaintiff.
mr.
lee
johnson
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
original
action,
under
article
iii,
section
2
of
the
constitution,
28
u.s.c.,
section
1251
in
which
the
state
of
oregon
is
the
plaintiff,
the
defendant
is
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states,
john
mitchell
who
is
not
a
resident
of
the
state
of
oregon.
we
are
seeking
a
decree
that
title
iii
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1970
is
unconstitutional
and
enjoining
defendant
from
enforcing
this
title
with
respect
to
the
plaintiff's
state.
the
guts
of
that
statute
is
simply
in
section
302
which
prohibit
states
from
denying
the
franchise
to
any
person
over
the
age
of
18
who
is
otherwise
qualified
to
vote.
mr.
lee
johnson
we
are
not
challenging
that,
mr.
justice.
the
oregon
constitution
like
that
of
46
other
states
restricts
the
franchise
to
those
who
are
21
years
and
older.
i
might
add
that
in
may
1970,
the
voters
of
oregon
overwhelmingly
defeated
a
constitutional
amendment
which
would
have
reduced
the
voting
age
to
19.
there
are
some
points,
in
the
plaintiff's
argument
over
which
i
think
there
is
a
little
dispute
and
which
i
would
like
to
dispose
off
at
the
outset.
first
that
states
have
traditionally
determined
voter
qualifications
and
that
tradition
was
contemplated
by
the
drafters
of
the
constitution
in
article
i,
section
2,
dealing
with
the
election
of
representatives
and
article
ii,
section
1,
dealing
with
the
selection
of
presidential
electors,
and
was
reaffirmed
even
after
the
passage
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
it
was
reaffirmed
in
the
seventeenth
amendment
which
deals
with
the
election
of
senators.
secondly,
states
certainly
have
a
vital
and
legitimate
interest
in
restricting
the
franchise
to
responsible
persons,
and
age
is
certainly
a
relevant
criteria
in
determining
the
qualifications
for
voter
responsibility.
thirdly,
the
implementation
of
an
age
classification
inevitably
leads
to
line
drawing
and
reasonable
men
can
certainly
differ
as
to
the
precise
location
of
that
line.
i
think
also,
there
are
obviously
outer
limits,
over
which
reasonable
men
would
also
not
differ
that
the
line
was
not
reasonable.
fourthly,
while
legislative
wisdom
may
prefer
one
line
over
another,
no
one
can
seriously
argue
that
a
minimum
age
of
18
or
19,
or
20,
or
21
is
irrational,
irrelevant
or
invidious.
i
think
this
court
could
perceive
a
reasonable
basis
for
any
one
of
these
choices.
i
think
the
--
the
point
was
put
very
succinctly
by
professor
herbert
wexler
in
a
letter
to
the
president
which
appears
in
the
congressional
record
on
this
legislation,
in
which
he
stated
and
i
quote,
“age
is
obviously
not
irrelevant
to
qualifications
and
since
any
age
criterion
involves
the
drawing
of
an
arbitrary
line,
fixing
the
age
at
21,
most
certainly
this
is
not
capricious.”
i
think
that
there
will
be
considerable
dispute
over
many
issues
that
will
follow
in
my
argument
and
the
solicitor
general
will
raise,
but
i
think
really
the
issue
in
this
case
boils
down
to
one
point,
and
it
is
simply
this.
it's
whether
congress
has
the
power
to
substitute
its
legislative
preference
in
selecting
that
line
for
the
preference
of
the
voters
of
the
state
of
oregon.
of
course,
for
congress
to
exercise
such
a
legislative
mandate,
it
must
look
to
one
of
the
enumerated
powers.
the
defendant
concedes
that
the
responsibility
for
determining
voter
qualifications
is
at
least
primarily
vested
in
the
states
by
the
constitution.
the
defendant
rests
its
case
on
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
think
in
order
to
understand
section
5,
we
must
first
examine
section
1
of
that
amendment.
and
i
think
the
point
should
be
made
at
section
1,
standing
alone
is
not
an
affirmative
grant
of
power
to
congress,
but
rather
it's
merely
a
prohibition
against
the
states.
and
this
is
in
contrast
to
the
enumerated
powers
of
congress
such
as
interstate
commerce
that
are
enumerated
in
article
i,
section
4
of
the
constitution.
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
gives
congress
the
power
to
do
all
that
is
necessary
and
proper
to
enforce
the
prohibition
of
section
1,
but
the
test
necessarily
must
be
whether
the
power
exercised
by
congress
is
appropriate
to
the
enforcement
of
what
is
prohibited
by
section
1.
in
title
iii,
congress
and
the
defendant
have
attempted
to
obviate
this
test
by
bootstrap
reasoning.
first,
in
section
301
of
the
act,
congress
declares
that
requiring
a
citizen
to
be
21
years
of
age
in
order
to
vote
is
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
prohibition.
and
therefore,
it
is
necessary
and
proper
to
enforce
the
prohibition
by
preventing
the
states
from
denying
the
franchise
to
anyone
who
is
over
18.
secondly,
defendant
now
asserts,
the
judicial
review
of
congress'
findings
is
confined
to
the
single
issue
of
whether
the
court
can
perceive
any
rational
basis
therefore.
we
concede
that
the
perceive
a
basis
test
is
the
appropriate
test
of
legislation
under
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
embodied
in
section
5.
we
also
concede
that
it's
a
proper
role
for
congress
to
seek
and
identify
violations
of
the
equal
protection
prohibition.
but
there
is
still
one
defective
link
in
defendant's
chain
of
reasoning
which
destroys
the
connection.
we
submit
that
first,
that
the
perceive
a
basis
test
is
not
the
appropriate
test
for
judicial
review
in
determining
the
scope
and
the
meaning
of
the
equal
protection
prohibition.
this
is
a
determination
that
must
be
made
by
this
court,
exercising
its
independent
judgment
and
review.
secondly,
even
if
the
perceive
a
basis
test
is
applicable,
there
is
no
ground
in
this
case
for
perceiving
a
basis
that
title
iii
is
aimed
at
a
fourteenth
amendment
objective.
now,
the
defendant
relies
on
a
single
case,
katzenbach
versus
morgan.
i
am
sure
the
court
is
familiar
with
the
case,
but
to
briefly
reiterate
the
facts,
there
congress
enactment
had
prohibited
the
states
from
denying
the
vote
on
account
of
illiteracy
to
any
person
of
puerto
rican
ancestry
who
had
attended
six
years
in
an
american
school.
the
difficult
problem
in
the
case
was
the
literacy
tests
on
their
face,
certainly
are
not
invidious
or
irrational.
nevertheless,
the
court
and
we
believe
correctly
upheld
the
act,
because
it
and
i
quote,
“maybe
readily
seen
as
plainly
adapted
to
further
the
aims
of
equal
protection.”
the
court
in
its
majority
opinion
followed
two
rationales
in
reaching
this
conclusion.
first,
that
the
enhanced
political
power
would
or
maybe
helpful
in
gaining
non-discriminatory
governmental
services
for
puerto
ricans,
and
for
that
reason
the
court
could
perceive
a
basis
that
the
legislation
was
necessary
and
proper
to
ensure
equal
protection
of
the
laws
for
this
particular
ethnic
minority
group.
secondly,
the
court
could
perceive
a
basis
for
congress
ascertaining
that
the
new
york
literacy
test
was
being
used
as
a
direct
device
to
deny
the
franchise
to
puerto
ricans,
solely
because
of
their
national
origin.
under
both
rationales,
the
court,
and
again
we
believe
rightly,
defined
congress'
powers
to
determine
what
is
necessary
and
proper
in
the
broadest
terms
and
confined
its
review
to
whether
it
could
perceive
a
basis
for
the
congressional
determination.
but
contrary
to
the
defendant's
argument,
the
court
merely
confirmed
what
was
obvious
in
that
case,
that
the
object
of
the
legislation
was
plainly
adopted
to
furthering
the
aims
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
as
the
court
itself
said
or
recognized
the
practical,
the
sole
practical
effect
of
that
act
in
katzenbach
versus
morgan
was
to
extend
the
franchise
to
large
segments
of
the
minority
group
which
had
heretofore
been
denied
the
right
largely
as
a
result
of
their
national
origin.
and
of
course
state
action
denying
rights
to
the
minorities
because
of
their
race,
color,
national
origin
are
classic
fourteenth
amendment
objectives.
but
contrary
to
defendant's
argument,
there
is
no
suggestion
in
katzenbach
versus
morgan
that
the
court
was
saying
that
congress
had
not
only
brought
powers
to
fashion
remedies,
but
that
congress
could
indeed
determine
what
is
prohibited
by
sections
1,
in
other
words,
what
is
prohibited
by
the
equal
protection
clause
and
that
that
determination
by
congress
would
be
binding
upon
this
court.
defendant's
interpretation
can
only
be
supported
by
taking
isolated
sentences
from
the
opinion
and
reading
those
sentences
totally
out
of
context.
furthermore,
there
is
no
support
in
the
precedence
for
defendant's
interpretation.
defendant
cites
two
cases
involving
interstate
commerce,
but
those
cases,
the
issue
in
those
issues
was
not
what
is
interstate
commerce,
but
rather
what
is
congress'
powers
under
the
necessary
and
proper
clause.
in
all
of
those
cases
the
court
still
reserved
to
itself
the
ultimate
determination
of
the
issue
of
what
is
interstate
commerce.
i'd
like
to
suggest
that
if
we
follow
defendant's
rationale,
it
would
mean
that
there
will
be
hardly
an
area
of
state
legislation
or
state
law
which
congress
could
not
preempt.
because
as
this
court
has
many
times
recognized,
legislatures
must
make
choices
and
necessarily
must
make
classifications
or
if
you
like,
we
can
call
them
discriminations,
but
these
classifications
are
inherent
in
the
legislative
process.
section
1
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
prohibit
all
classifications
and
never
has,
but
only
those
which
are
irrelevant,
invidious,
or
irrational.
but
if
we
are
going
to
leave
to
congress
the
prerogative
to
determine
which
classifications
come
within
the
equal
protection,
then
congress
could
declare
almost
all
state
legislation,
declare
the
classifications
therein
as
a
violation
of
equal
protection
and
thus
be
within
their
scope,
so
that
they
can
preempt
the
states
and
render
your
state
legislatures
virtually
unnecessary.
but
as
a
practical
matter,
the
contraction
of
state
power
or
state
jurisdiction
under
defendant's
rationale
may
not
be
as
significant
as
the
effect
of
that
rationale
would
have
upon
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
in
the
first
place,
if
we
follow
defendant's
rationale
and
if
congress
can
determine
what
is
violative
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
then
by
equal
logic,
congress
should
be
able
to
determine
what
is
not
violating
of
the
amendment.
i
think
the
court
in
its
opinion,
in
katzenbach
versus
morgan
clearly
indicates
that
it
was
not
buying
the
defendant's
argument,
because
in
footnote
10,
the
court
indicates
that,
no,
it
is
reserving
to
itself,
to
its
independent
judgment
what
is
violative
and
what
is
not
violative
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
lee
johnson
my
only
response
to
that
mr.
justice
would
be
that
i
can't
see
how
you
can
reserve
it
one
way
and
i
go
both
ways
and
i
think
that
the
fact
that
footnote
is
there
--
mr.
lee
johnson
the
question
is
whether
--
i
think
really
the
question
is
whether
the
majority
opinion
goes
as
far
as
the
government
says
it
does,
and
i
think
one
of
the
indications
that
it
does
not
is
that
footnote.
mr.
lee
johnson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lee
johnson
i
think
that
the
legislation
would
be
on
a
stronger
basis,
if
it
was
limited
to
only
federal
officers
because
then
possibly
the
government
could
rely
on
its
general
preservation
of
the
federal
election
process
as
it
grounds
in
not
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
uphold
the
statute.
so
for
that
reason
i
would
say
that
it
would
be
a
different.
it
would
certainly
be
a
different
ballgame,
but
in
this
case,
they
have
rested
it
solely
upon
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
lee
johnson
right.
mr.
lee
johnson
i
think
it
is
possible
to
make
them
severable,
although
the
act
is
not
contained
in
severability
clause,
and
i
think
if
we
do
make
them
severable,
the
court
should
maybe
consider
the
very
definite
administrative
difficulty
that
this
would
probably
create,
and
maybe
it
would
be
better
to
refer
it
back
to
congress
because
if
the
states
are
put
in
a
position,
they
have
to
grant
this
franchise
to
eighteen-year-olds
in
federal
elections,
but
not
in
state
elections,
this
creates
a
tremendous
administrative
burden.
so
it
seems
to
me
there
would
be
a
real
question
of
whether
congress
actually
intended
that
the
statute
to
be
severable.
the
second
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
if
congress
is
to
be
the
interpretor
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
then
it
likewise
would
have
to
be
the
interpretor
of
other
sections
of
the
constitution.
for
example,
congress
could
not
only
determine
what
was
necessary
and
proper,
but
could
determine
what
in
fact
is
interstate
commerce.
congress
could
reserve
for
itself
to
determine
what
is
in
fact
a
constitutional
tax.
i
point
you
to
article
i,
section
8
of
the
constitution
which
says
that
“congress
shall
have
the
power
to
make
all
the
laws
which
will
be
necessary
and
proper
and
all
other
powers
vested
by
this
constitution
and
the
government
of
the
united
states
or
any
department
or
officer
thereof.”
under
defendant's
rationale,
congress
could
determine
itself
the
limits
of
the
power
conferred
upon
itself,
the
limits
of
the
power
conferred
upon
the
president,
the
limits
of
the
power
conferred
upon
this
court,
and
the
limits
of
the
powers
of
the
federal
government
as
against
the
state
subject
only
to
the
test
of
whether
this
court
could
perceive
a
basis.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we
follow
defendant's
rationale,
we're
doing
nothing
less
than
repudiating
the
doctrine
of
judicial
review.
we
submit
that
katzenbach
versus
morgan
does
not
go
that
far,
but
merely
holds
that
congress
has
broad
powers
to
fashion
remedies
to
enforce
the
prohibitions
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
the
instant
case,
there
is
no
equal
protection
objective
that
can
be
identified,
unlike
katzenbach
versus
morgan
which
enfranchised
a
minority
ethnic
group.
the
sole
effect,
the
sole
practical
effect
of
title
iii
will
be
to
enfranchise
any
person
who
is
between
the
age
of
18
and
21.
there
is
no
suggestion
on
the
congressional
debate
and
indeed
there
could
be
none
that
this
will
enfranchise
a
group
which
had
heretofore
been
discriminated
against
because
of
their
race,
their
color,
their
national
origin
or
economic
status
or
on
any
other
basis
that
could
be
classified
as
invidious,
irrelevant,
or
irrational.
now
to
some,
including
myself
personally,
it
would
be
desirable
to
extend
the
franchise,
but
legislative
desirability
is
not
the
test.
the
issue
which
this
court
must
decide
and
cannot
cede
to
congress
to
decide,
is
whether
restricting
the
franchise
to
those
who
are
21
is
so
inherently
unreasonable
to
be
irrational
or
irrelevant.
we
submit
that
21
years
of
age,
the
21
years
of
age
standard
employed
by
oregon,
46
other
states,
indeed
which
is
infirmed
in
section
2
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
deals
with
re-apportionment,
the
only
place
in
the
united
states
constitution
where
the
21-year
standard
is
mentioned.
but
this
is
certainly
an
affirmance
of
what
has
gone
for
many
years,
that
the
21-year
age
standard
is
a
reasonable
classification
even
if
it
might
not
be
a
desirable
classification,
it
is
a
reasonable
classification,
the
ball
is
far
short
of
the
prohibitions
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
feel
that
the
government
advances
the
argument
that
there
must
be
a
compelling
state
interest
and
advances
many
arguments
which
are
legislative
reasons,
not
constitutional
reasons,
but
legislative
reasons
for
extending
the
franchise
to
18-year
olds.
and
the
suggestion
is
made
by
the
government
that
great
deference
should
be
given
to
congress
because
they
are
better
at
this
line
drawing
exercise
than
a
court
gives.
we
suggest,
once
you
accept
the
proposition
that
a
line
has
been
drawn,
there
is
an
area
in
here
to
which
reasonable
men
differ
as
to
where
that
line
should
be
drawn.
but
the
decision
there
is
not
to
be
made
by
congress
because
the
constitution
contemplates
that
decision
as
to
voter
qualifications
would
be
made
by
the
state.
and
still
the
question
must
be
made,
must
be
the
only
question
is
whether
the
classification
that
is
made
by
the
states
meets
the
fourteenth
amendment
standards
of
being
invidious,
irrational
or
irrelevant.
for
these
reasons
we
pray
that
the
court
will
grant
the
relief
to
plaintiff.
