mr.
charles
alan
wright
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
legal
position
of
texas
is
exactly
the
same
as
that
of
oregon.
i
want
to
check
insofar
as
possible
to
avoid
duplicating
the
able
arguments
that
attorney
general
johnson
has
made
on
behalf
of
oregon
with
regards
to
title
iii.
last
week,
reading
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
to
which
one
of
the
most
respected
law
firms
of
the
united
states
has
lent
its
name,
i
came
across
an
argument
in
support
of
the
statute
that
seemed
to
be
quite
interesting.
it
was
said
that
even
if,
it
is
not
a
denial
of
equal
protection
to
deny
to
vote
to
those
between
18
and
21,
that
many
in
that
age
group
think
that
it
is,
that
this
causes
a
sense
of
alienation
and
the
congress
has
power
under
section
5
of
fourteenth
amendment
to
cure
this
feeling
of
alienation
even
if
it
is
the
product
of
only
an
apparent
and
not
a
real
denial
of
equal
protection.
that
argument
seemed
to
me
to
highlight
the
unreality
of
this
entire
litigation.
were
it
not
for
the
respect,
as
always
do
to
the
body
that
sits
across
the
street,
i
suggest
that
the
proper
response
to
this
court
would
have
been
to
dismiss
out
of
hand,
the
attempt
to
support
this
legislation
on
the
grounds
that
the
legislation
frivolous.
prior
to
1965,
i
cannot
suppose
that
anyone
would
have
imagined
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
has
the
power
to
substitute
its
preference
for
that
of
the
state
with
regard
to
the
age
of
voters.
even
under
the
broadest
reading
of
katzenbach
v.
oregon
it
is
still
necessary,
and
the
phrase
that
john
marshall
has
picked
up
there
that
the
acts
of
congress
be
consistent
with
letter
and
spirit
of
the
constitution
and
i
submit
that
this
legislation
is
not.
this
legislation
flies
in
the
face
of
the
letter
of
the
constitution,
that
it
does
violence
to
a
constitutional
tradition
that
has
gone
on
as
long
as
the
country
has
existed.
there
are
many
provisions
for
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
that
are
not
hastily
read,
but
about
which
reasonably
men
readily
differ,
but
i
should
have
thought
that
the
numerical
provisions
in
the
constitution
above
all,
are
provisions
that
have
one
meaning,
a
meaning
that
does
not
change
with
passage
of
time,
but
when
people
of
the
united
states
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
referred
twice,
21
years
of
age
as
being
an
appropriate
age
for
people
to
vote,
that
they
meant
21
years
of
age,
they
did
not
mean
18
or
some
other
number,
no
matter
how
functionally,
similar
that
number
today
maybe
to
what
21
was
a
century
ago.
it
is,
i
suppose
always
a
temptation
to
counsel
to
overstate
the
importance
of
this
case.
i
do
not
wish
to
sound
like
george
pepper
argument
in
carter
v.
carter
coal
or
like
the
distinguished
advocate
(inaudible)
first
income
tax
case,
but
i
submit
as
seriously
as
i
can
that
the
issue
in
this
case
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
18-year-olds
vote
or
not.
that's
an
(inaudible)
is
going
to
come
whatever
the
decision
of
this
court
in
this
case.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
more
fundamental
than
that.
it
is
whether
the
historic
concept
of
this
country,
a
country,
a
federal
union
in
which
the
central
government
and
the
states
share
powers
and
responsibilities
allocated
by
a
written
constitution,
whether
that
concept
is
a
failure,
whether
we
now
must
take
constitutional
shortcuts
in
order
to
impose
on
the
states
a
reform,
to
a
majority
of
congress
seems
desirable,
but
that
46
states
have
not
yet
seen
fit
to
embrace.
the
most
rigorous
test
for
state
voting
qualifications
under
the
equal
protection
clause
is
that
the
states
must
be
able
to
show
a
compelling
state
interest
to
justify
the
exclusion
of
a
group
from
the
electorate.
even
measured
against
that
test,
it
seems
in
my
submission,
that
texas
and
45
other
states
come
through
with
flying
colors.
the
distinguished
solicitor
general
agrees,
as
i
understand
his
brief,
that
there
is
a
compelling
state
interest
in
seeing
to
it
that
the
electorate
is
composed
of
persons
who
are
well-informed,
mature
and
responsible.
the
question
then
becomes
how
you
go
about
implementing
this
compelling
state
interest.
how
you
identify
those
persons
who
are
qualified
to
exercise
the
privilege
or
suffrage
from
those
who
are
not.
now
here
again
i
believe,
if
i
understand
them
correctly,
that
the
solicitor
general
does
not
disagree
with
our
position,
that
age
is
an
appropriate
means
for
making
this
determination.
no
one
supposes
that
age
is
infallible,
perhaps,
not
even
very
good
criterion
for
this
purpose.
there
is
in
courtroom
today,
a
17-year-old
citizen
of
my
state
who
is
better
informed,
more
responsible,
more
mature
than
most
18,
21,
43-year
olds
that
i
know,
yet
neither
congress
nor
the
state
of
texas
are
willing
to
allow
him
to
vote,
because
neither
one
of
those
have
any
calibers
by
which
we
can
say,
“yes,
this
17-year-old
is
ready
to
vote,
this
17-year-old
is
not.”
and
so,
the
invariable
practice
of
the
american
states,
a
practice
that
congress
does
not
undertake
to
supersede
in
this
legislation,
is
that
we
are
going
to
watch
the
age,
we
are
going
to
indulge
a
presumption
that
when
a
person
reaches
a
certain
age,
at
that
point
he
possesses
in
sufficient
quantity,
these
qualities
of
education,
responsibility,
maturity
that
will
let
him
become
a
part
of
political
process.
perhaps,
as
a
matter
of
preference,
desirability,
all
the
impressive
data
that
was
spoken
of
on
the
floor
of
congress
suggest
that
today,
we
can
safely
entrust
to
those
who
are
18
of
this
privilege
and
responsibility.
but
texas
and
45
other
states
have
said,
no.
we
have
said
that
we
would
rather
wait
until
a
person
is
21.
we
feel
that
when
he
reaches
that
age,
that
we
can
be
reasonably
confident
that
he
has
the
needed
qualities.
for
congress
to
say
that
we
are
denying
to
our
citizens
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
by
doing
this,
for
congress
to
say
that
somehow
this
determination
on
the
part
of
texas
is
irrational
or
invidious
or
unnecessary
for
state
purposes
is
simply
to
substitute
congress'
determination
of
this
factual
question
for
the
determination
with
the
people
of
texas
have
made
for
themselves,
a
determination
that
we
think
we
were
amply
justified
in
making
for
ourselves
in
the
light
of
this
specific
twice
repeated
language
of
section
2
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
would
be
making
the
argument
with
much
less
confidence
that
it
would
prevail,
justice
white.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
hope
i
would
not.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it's
seems
to
me
sir,
if
i
may,
that
the
time
is
an
example
you
suggest
when
the
difference
is
not
merely
one
of
degree
not
merely
one
of
preference,
but
a
difference
is
so
extreme
and
conned
that
the
state
action
might
probably
would
be
regardless
capricious
and
not
identified
with
the
compelling
state
interest,
we
think
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
that
the
court
would
find
out
the
denial
of
equal
protection
is
even
uninformed
by
congress.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
even
absent
at
section
2,
i
would
think
so,
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes
sir.
if
i
may
expand
on
that
answer
a
moment,
justice
white,
it
seems
to
me
is
the
opposite
of
the
argument
that
you
suggest
is
important.
it
is
not
that
you
can
argue
that
18-year-olds
are
as
capable
as
21,
but
that
on
the
other
hand,
one
can
argue
that
to
require
that
voters
be
21
is
not
so
different
from
18
as
to
be
an
irrational
judgment.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
justice
brennan,
i
think
that
everyone
who
has
studied
section
2
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
knows
that
it
was
a
cleverly
contrived,
compromise.
it
was
pretended
not
only
to
put
a
premium
on
negro
voting
of
the
south
and
not
the
north,
it
was
intended
also
to
make
sure
that
aliens
in
new
york,
and
women
in
massachusetts
were
counted
in
apportionment
of
congress,
though
they
were
denied
to
vote
at
the
time,
but
i
have
not
understood
that
there
was
any
history
indicating
that
the
choice
of
the
age
21
in
that
provision
was
any
part
of
this
elaborate
political
compromise.
and
as
i
read
history,
age
21
is
there
because
the
draftsman
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
states
that
ratified
it,
regarded
21
as
the
appropriate
age
at
which
one
become
a
part
of
the
electorate.
the
solicitor
general
has
suggested
that
perhaps
the
references
to
21
in
section
2
maybe
regarded
as
descriptive
rather
than
prescriptive.
it
is
a
suggestion
that
we
find
it
difficult
it
to
follow.
the
section
says,
and
this
is
not
merely
describing,
it
is
prescribing,
that
if
you
start
denying
the
right
to
vote
to
persons
who
over
21-years
of
age
who
otherwise
meet
the
tests
we
say
here,
you
are
going
to
lose
that
proportion
of
your
congressional
delegation
that
the
number
you
exclude
bears
to
the
whole
number
of
persons
over
21.
now
that,
in
my
submission
is
prescriptive
language,
that
it
is
never
been
enforced,
does
not
mean
that
it
could
not
be
enforced
or
that
it
was
not
intended
to
be
enforced
or
that
it
should
not
be
read
today
as
having
legal
significance.
it
would
be
–
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes
sir,
i
guess
with
regard
to
age
21
i
am
saying
that
there
is
no
ambiguity
but
either
ones
may
read
this.
i
would
not
suggest
that
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
is
not
an
instrument
but
has
a
capacity
for
growth.
obviously
the
power
of
the
central
government
under
the
commerce
clause
and
others
is
much
greater
now
than
it
was
at
an
earlier
time
and
anyone
who
bares
the
scares
of
maryland
free
words
can't
be
unaware
of
that,
but
i
do
submit,
that
it
is
one
thing
to
allow
congress
a
very
great
discretion,
and
considerable
free
play
and
decide
what
regulatory
measures
are
needed
in
order
to
foster
the
economy,
to
promote
commerce
among
the
several
states.
but
that
it
would
be
quite
another
thing,
to
give
congress
that
same
kind
of
a
free-hand
in
regulating
the
political
make-up
of
the
states,
and
particularly
in
the
relation
to
the
federal
government,
that
this
is
the
one
area
that
until
now
has
been
left
to
the
states.
we
have
still
been
a
body
politic,
a
constituent
part
of
the
federal
union,
free
to
govern
ourselves
at
least
in
terms
of
determining
how
we
will
govern
ourselves,
though
we
must
of
course
yield
to
federal
legislation
and
regulatory
sphere.
it
is
this
that
the
judgment
of
texas
is
endangered
by
the
statute
that
is
now
in
front
of
us.
the
resort
to
imaginary
(inaudible)
is
always
a
risky
form
of
legal
reasoning,
and
i
prefer
not
to
use
it,
and
yet
as
we
have
suggested
in
our
brief,
if
this
act
is
constitutional,
it
is
hard
to
visualize
any
other
act
of
congress
with
regard
to
voting
qualifications
that
could
not
be
justified
as
easily,
and
there
are
good
many
things
that
go
beyond
the
area
of
voting
qualifications.
the
congress
might
decide
where
necessary
in
order
to
enforce
the
grants
of
due
process
of
law
and
of
equal
protection.
in
texas'
view,
the
reason
nobody
ever
suspected
until
this
past
spring
that
this
power
isn't
congress
under
the
constitution
is
because
the
power
under
the
constitution
is
not
in
congress,
because
the
internal
control
that
the
state
has
with
regard
to
its
own
government
by
the
constitution
is
specifically
left
to
the
states
and
with
regard
to
our
particular
issue
here,
the
choice
of
the
age
21
is
one
that
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
specifically
says,
texas
may
make,
and
it
is
for
those
reasons
that
texas
prays
for
a
judgment
declaring
title
iii
to
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
mr.
chief
justice,
it
has
been
agreed
that
i
would
make
the
rebuttal
for
both
arguments
in
texas.
i
believe
i
can
do
it
before
the
lunch
recess
if
that
was
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
would,
seeing
the
clock
to
make
my
points,
if
i
grab
the
mic.
first,
with
regard
to
the
question
that
justice
harlan
and
justice
stewart
asked
about
separability,
i
believe
that
section
205
of
the
statute
provides
sufficient
answer.
it
is
a
separability
clause,
part
of
the
1970
legislation
itself.
it
appears
at
sort
of
funny
place,
you
generally
expect
to
find
separability
clauses
at
the
end
of
the
statute,
but
this
is
because
title
iii
was
added
as
a
rider
in
the
senate.
it
was
the
final
section.
as
it
passed
to
house,
it
does
speak
general
to
act,
so
that
the
age
provisions
of
title
iii
can
be
separated
from
the
literacy
and
durational
residency
provisions
of
the
other
portions
of
the
act.
i
would
not
wish
my
argument
to
have
been
understood
at
all,
as
suggesting
that
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
specifically
protection
clause
fourteenth
amendment
do
not
reach
the
question
of
voting
qualifications.
i
recognize
the
force
of
the
historical
argument
that
justice
harlan
has
mustered
on
several
occasions,
but
my
own
conclusion
has
been
with
the
whole
history
of
the
39th
congress
and
various
legislation,
and
constitutional
amendments
have
produced
is
sufficiently
inconclusive,
but
interpreting
those
provisions
of
the
constitution,
it
is
better
simply
to
look
at
the
constitutional
language,
than
to
try
and
discern
the
intent
of
of
the
framers.
my
recollection
is
that
when
harper
v.
board
of
elections
was
argued
here,
that
one
of
the
members
of
the
court
inquired
if
virginia
could
deny
the
franchise
to
persons
who
had
red
hair,
and
the
answer,
solicitor's
position
and
thing
argued
was,
that
the
equal
protection
clause
was
totally
inequitable,
the
answer
was
yes.
now,
i
do
not
envy
counsel
who
was
in
a
position
where
he
had
to
give
that
answer,
plainly
a
discrimination
that
invidious
is
one
that
it
could
be
very
odd
if
the
equal
protection
clause
didn't
reach.
and
so
cases
such
as
evidenced
in
cornman
in
which
my
friend
solicitor
general
finds
very
comfort
do
not
trouble
me
at
all.
they
seem
--
may
have
wholly
consistent
with
position
we
take
here,
that
voting
qualifications
may
be
a
matter
within
the
can
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
but
this
particular
qualification
that
we
are
defending
in
this
case
is
not
long
that
either
this
court
or
the
congress
can
rationally
say
false
or
afoul
of
the
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
principal
burden
of
my
argument
in
chief,
was
that
to
sustain
the
statute
would
be
to
replace
a
system
of
constitutional
federalism,
with
a
system
of
congressional
federalism,
and
i
undertook
to
suggest
you
that
this
seems
peculiarly
inappropriate,
with
regard
to
the
political
arrangements
of
the
states
that
congress
should
be
allowed
to
decide
for
itself
the
extent
of
its
power
to
order
the
political
arrangements
in
texas
and
other
states.
many
years
ago
george
brayton
wrote
an
article
on
the
chicago
law
review,
called
empire
to
the
federal
system.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
one
of
the
highest
functions
of
this
court,
but
when
disputes
arise
between
congress
and
the
states
as
to
the
respect
of
powers,
we
can't
ask
congress
to
decide,
whether
it
is
safe
or
out?
we
come
here,
because
this
court
in
a
tradition
of
marbury
v.
madison,
must
make
that
decision.
i
think
that
it
would
not
be
only
constitutional
federalism
could
be
jeopardized
by
a
decision
against
us
here,
but
we
would
also
run
a
great
risk
of
replacing
constitutional
liberty
with
congressional
liberty,
because
i
have
the
difficulty
that
justice
harlan
indicated
from
the
bench,
with
regard
to
footnote
10
in
the
morgan
opinion,
and
it
is
hard
to
see
what
congress
might
not
do
if
congress
is
to
be
given
as
broader
scope
as
is
argued
under
section
5
of
fourteenth
amendment.
it
is
true
as
the
solicitor
general
says
that
section
2
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
all
--
probably
as
little
used,
as
ineffective
a
provision
as
appears
in
the
constitution,
but
it
is
there,
and
i
do
not
think
that
constitutional
provisions
wither
away
by
(inaudible),
or
the
words
that
were
adopted
by
the
country
in
section
2
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
are
less
important
today,
simply
because
they
have
not
been
invoked
in
other
occasions
in
which
they
might
have
been
appropriate.
thank
you
very
much,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
legal
position
of
texas
is
exactly
the
same
as
that
of
oregon.
i
want
to
check
insofar
as
possible
to
avoid
duplicating
the
able
arguments
that
attorney
general
johnson
has
made
on
behalf
of
oregon
with
regards
to
title
iii.
last
week,
reading
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
to
which
one
of
the
most
respected
law
firms
of
the
united
states
has
lent
its
name,
i
came
across
an
argument
in
support
of
the
statute
that
seemed
to
be
quite
interesting.
it
was
said
that
even
if,
it
is
not
a
denial
of
equal
protection
to
deny
to
vote
to
those
between
18
and
21,
that
many
in
that
age
group
think
that
it
is,
that
this
causes
a
sense
of
alienation
and
the
congress
has
power
under
section
5
of
fourteenth
amendment
to
cure
this
feeling
of
alienation
even
if
it
is
the
product
of
only
an
apparent
and
not
a
real
denial
of
equal
protection.
that
argument
seemed
to
me
to
highlight
the
unreality
of
this
entire
litigation.
were
it
not
for
the
respect,
as
always
do
to
the
body
that
sits
across
the
street,
i
suggest
that
the
proper
response
to
this
court
would
have
been
to
dismiss
out
of
hand,
the
attempt
to
support
this
legislation
on
the
grounds
that
the
legislation
frivolous.
prior
to
1965,
i
cannot
suppose
that
anyone
would
have
imagined
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
has
the
power
to
substitute
its
preference
for
that
of
the
state
with
regard
to
the
age
of
voters.
even
under
the
broadest
reading
of
katzenbach
v.
oregon
it
is
still
necessary,
and
the
phrase
that
john
marshall
has
picked
up
there
that
the
acts
of
congress
be
consistent
with
letter
and
spirit
of
the
constitution
and
i
submit
that
this
legislation
is
not.
this
legislation
flies
in
the
face
of
the
letter
of
the
constitution,
that
it
does
violence
to
a
constitutional
tradition
that
has
gone
on
as
long
as
the
country
has
existed.
there
are
many
provisions
for
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
that
are
not
hastily
read,
but
about
which
reasonably
men
readily
differ,
but
i
should
have
thought
that
the
numerical
provisions
in
the
constitution
above
all,
are
provisions
that
have
one
meaning,
a
meaning
that
does
not
change
with
passage
of
time,
but
when
people
of
the
united
states
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
referred
twice,
21
years
of
age
as
being
an
appropriate
age
for
people
to
vote,
that
they
meant
21
years
of
age,
they
did
not
mean
18
or
some
other
number,
no
matter
how
functionally,
similar
that
number
today
maybe
to
what
21
was
a
century
ago.
it
is,
i
suppose
always
a
temptation
to
counsel
to
overstate
the
importance
of
this
case.
i
do
not
wish
to
sound
like
george
pepper
argument
in
carter
v.
carter
coal
or
like
the
distinguished
advocate
(inaudible)
first
income
tax
case,
but
i
submit
as
seriously
as
i
can
that
the
issue
in
this
case
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
18-year-olds
vote
or
not.
that's
an
(inaudible)
is
going
to
come
whatever
the
decision
of
this
court
in
this
case.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
more
fundamental
than
that.
it
is
whether
the
historic
concept
of
this
country,
a
country,
a
federal
union
in
which
the
central
government
and
the
states
share
powers
and
responsibilities
allocated
by
a
written
constitution,
whether
that
concept
is
a
failure,
whether
we
now
must
take
constitutional
shortcuts
in
order
to
impose
on
the
states
a
reform,
to
a
majority
of
congress
seems
desirable,
but
that
46
states
have
not
yet
seen
fit
to
embrace.
the
most
rigorous
test
for
state
voting
qualifications
under
the
equal
protection
clause
is
that
the
states
must
be
able
to
show
a
compelling
state
interest
to
justify
the
exclusion
of
a
group
from
the
electorate.
even
measured
against
that
test,
it
seems
in
my
submission,
that
texas
and
45
other
states
come
through
with
flying
colors.
the
distinguished
solicitor
general
agrees,
as
i
understand
his
brief,
that
there
is
a
compelling
state
interest
in
seeing
to
it
that
the
electorate
is
composed
of
persons
who
are
well-informed,
mature
and
responsible.
the
question
then
becomes
how
you
go
about
implementing
this
compelling
state
interest.
how
you
identify
those
persons
who
are
qualified
to
exercise
the
privilege
or
suffrage
from
those
who
are
not.
now
here
again
i
believe,
if
i
understand
them
correctly,
that
the
solicitor
general
does
not
disagree
with
our
position,
that
age
is
an
appropriate
means
for
making
this
determination.
no
one
supposes
that
age
is
infallible,
perhaps,
not
even
very
good
criterion
for
this
purpose.
there
is
in
courtroom
today,
a
17-year-old
citizen
of
my
state
who
is
better
informed,
more
responsible,
more
mature
than
most
18,
21,
43-year
olds
that
i
know,
yet
neither
congress
nor
the
state
of
texas
are
willing
to
allow
him
to
vote,
because
neither
one
of
those
have
any
calibers
by
which
we
can
say,
“yes,
this
17-year-old
is
ready
to
vote,
this
17-year-old
is
not.”
and
so,
the
invariable
practice
of
the
american
states,
a
practice
that
congress
does
not
undertake
to
supersede
in
this
legislation,
is
that
we
are
going
to
watch
the
age,
we
are
going
to
indulge
a
presumption
that
when
a
person
reaches
a
certain
age,
at
that
point
he
possesses
in
sufficient
quantity,
these
qualities
of
education,
responsibility,
maturity
that
will
let
him
become
a
part
of
political
process.
perhaps,
as
a
matter
of
preference,
desirability,
all
the
impressive
data
that
was
spoken
of
on
the
floor
of
congress
suggest
that
today,
we
can
safely
entrust
to
those
who
are
18
of
this
privilege
and
responsibility.
but
texas
and
45
other
states
have
said,
no.
we
have
said
that
we
would
rather
wait
until
a
person
is
21.
we
feel
that
when
he
reaches
that
age,
that
we
can
be
reasonably
confident
that
he
has
the
needed
qualities.
for
congress
to
say
that
we
are
denying
to
our
citizens
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
by
doing
this,
for
congress
to
say
that
somehow
this
determination
on
the
part
of
texas
is
irrational
or
invidious
or
unnecessary
for
state
purposes
is
simply
to
substitute
congress'
determination
of
this
factual
question
for
the
determination
with
the
people
of
texas
have
made
for
themselves,
a
determination
that
we
think
we
were
amply
justified
in
making
for
ourselves
in
the
light
of
this
specific
twice
repeated
language
of
section
2
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
would
be
making
the
argument
with
much
less
confidence
that
it
would
prevail,
justice
white.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
hope
i
would
not.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it's
seems
to
me
sir,
if
i
may,
that
the
time
is
an
example
you
suggest
when
the
difference
is
not
merely
one
of
degree
not
merely
one
of
preference,
but
a
difference
is
so
extreme
and
conned
that
the
state
action
might
probably
would
be
regardless
capricious
and
not
identified
with
the
compelling
state
interest,
we
think
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
that
the
court
would
find
out
the
denial
of
equal
protection
is
even
uninformed
by
congress.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
even
absent
at
section
2,
i
would
think
so,
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes
sir.
if
i
may
expand
on
that
answer
a
moment,
justice
white,
it
seems
to
me
is
the
opposite
of
the
argument
that
you
suggest
is
important.
it
is
not
that
you
can
argue
that
18-year-olds
are
as
capable
as
21,
but
that
on
the
other
hand,
one
can
argue
that
to
require
that
voters
be
21
is
not
so
different
from
18
as
to
be
an
irrational
judgment.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
justice
brennan,
i
think
that
everyone
who
has
studied
section
2
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
knows
that
it
was
a
cleverly
contrived,
compromise.
it
was
pretended
not
only
to
put
a
premium
on
negro
voting
of
the
south
and
not
the
north,
it
was
intended
also
to
make
sure
that
aliens
in
new
york,
and
women
in
massachusetts
were
counted
in
apportionment
of
congress,
though
they
were
denied
to
vote
at
the
time,
but
i
have
not
understood
that
there
was
any
history
indicating
that
the
choice
of
the
age
21
in
that
provision
was
any
part
of
this
elaborate
political
compromise.
and
as
i
read
history,
age
21
is
there
because
the
draftsman
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
states
that
ratified
it,
regarded
21
as
the
appropriate
age
at
which
one
become
a
part
of
the
electorate.
the
solicitor
general
has
suggested
that
perhaps
the
references
to
21
in
section
2
maybe
regarded
as
descriptive
rather
than
prescriptive.
it
is
a
suggestion
that
we
find
it
difficult
it
to
follow.
the
section
says,
and
this
is
not
merely
describing,
it
is
prescribing,
that
if
you
start
denying
the
right
to
vote
to
persons
who
over
21-years
of
age
who
otherwise
meet
the
tests
we
say
here,
you
are
going
to
lose
that
proportion
of
your
congressional
delegation
that
the
number
you
exclude
bears
to
the
whole
number
of
persons
over
21.
now
that,
in
my
submission
is
prescriptive
language,
that
it
is
never
been
enforced,
does
not
mean
that
it
could
not
be
enforced
or
that
it
was
not
intended
to
be
enforced
or
that
it
should
not
be
read
today
as
having
legal
significance.
it
would
be
–
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes
sir,
i
guess
with
regard
to
age
21
i
am
saying
that
there
is
no
ambiguity
but
either
ones
may
read
this.
i
would
not
suggest
that
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
is
not
an
instrument
but
has
a
capacity
for
growth.
obviously
the
power
of
the
central
government
under
the
commerce
clause
and
others
is
much
greater
now
than
it
was
at
an
earlier
time
and
anyone
who
bares
the
scares
of
maryland
free
words
can't
be
unaware
of
that,
but
i
do
submit,
that
it
is
one
thing
to
allow
congress
a
very
great
discretion,
and
considerable
free
play
and
decide
what
regulatory
measures
are
needed
in
order
to
foster
the
economy,
to
promote
commerce
among
the
several
states.
but
that
it
would
be
quite
another
thing,
to
give
congress
that
same
kind
of
a
free-hand
in
regulating
the
political
make-up
of
the
states,
and
particularly
in
the
relation
to
the
federal
government,
that
this
is
the
one
area
that
until
now
has
been
left
to
the
states.
we
have
still
been
a
body
politic,
a
constituent
part
of
the
federal
union,
free
to
govern
ourselves
at
least
in
terms
of
determining
how
we
will
govern
ourselves,
though
we
must
of
course
yield
to
federal
legislation
and
regulatory
sphere.
it
is
this
that
the
judgment
of
texas
is
endangered
by
the
statute
that
is
now
in
front
of
us.
the
resort
to
imaginary
(inaudible)
is
always
a
risky
form
of
legal
reasoning,
and
i
prefer
not
to
use
it,
and
yet
as
we
have
suggested
in
our
brief,
if
this
act
is
constitutional,
it
is
hard
to
visualize
any
other
act
of
congress
with
regard
to
voting
qualifications
that
could
not
be
justified
as
easily,
and
there
are
good
many
things
that
go
beyond
the
area
of
voting
qualifications.
the
congress
might
decide
where
necessary
in
order
to
enforce
the
grants
of
due
process
of
law
and
of
equal
protection.
in
texas'
view,
the
reason
nobody
ever
suspected
until
this
past
spring
that
this
power
isn't
congress
under
the
constitution
is
because
the
power
under
the
constitution
is
not
in
congress,
because
the
internal
control
that
the
state
has
with
regard
to
its
own
government
by
the
constitution
is
specifically
left
to
the
states
and
with
regard
to
our
particular
issue
here,
the
choice
of
the
age
21
is
one
that
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
specifically
says,
texas
may
make,
and
it
is
for
those
reasons
that
texas
prays
for
a
judgment
declaring
title
iii
to
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
mr.
chief
justice,
it
has
been
agreed
that
i
would
make
the
rebuttal
for
both
arguments
in
texas.
i
believe
i
can
do
it
before
the
lunch
recess
if
that
was
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
would,
seeing
the
clock
to
make
my
points,
if
i
grab
the
mic.
first,
with
regard
to
the
question
that
justice
harlan
and
justice
stewart
asked
about
separability,
i
believe
that
section
205
of
the
statute
provides
sufficient
answer.
it
is
a
separability
clause,
part
of
the
1970
legislation
itself.
it
appears
at
sort
of
funny
place,
you
generally
expect
to
find
separability
clauses
at
the
end
of
the
statute,
but
this
is
because
title
iii
was
added
as
a
rider
in
the
senate.
it
was
the
final
section.
as
it
passed
to
house,
it
does
speak
general
to
act,
so
that
the
age
provisions
of
title
iii
can
be
separated
from
the
literacy
and
durational
residency
provisions
of
the
other
portions
of
the
act.
i
would
not
wish
my
argument
to
have
been
understood
at
all,
as
suggesting
that
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
specifically
protection
clause
fourteenth
amendment
do
not
reach
the
question
of
voting
qualifications.
i
recognize
the
force
of
the
historical
argument
that
justice
harlan
has
mustered
on
several
occasions,
but
my
own
conclusion
has
been
with
the
whole
history
of
the
39th
congress
and
various
legislation,
and
constitutional
amendments
have
produced
is
sufficiently
inconclusive,
but
interpreting
those
provisions
of
the
constitution,
it
is
better
simply
to
look
at
the
constitutional
language,
than
to
try
and
discern
the
intent
of
of
the
framers.
my
recollection
is
that
when
harper
v.
board
of
elections
was
argued
here,
that
one
of
the
members
of
the
court
inquired
if
virginia
could
deny
the
franchise
to
persons
who
had
red
hair,
and
the
answer,
solicitor's
position
and
thing
argued
was,
that
the
equal
protection
clause
was
totally
inequitable,
the
answer
was
yes.
now,
i
do
not
envy
counsel
who
was
in
a
position
where
he
had
to
give
that
answer,
plainly
a
discrimination
that
invidious
is
one
that
it
could
be
very
odd
if
the
equal
protection
clause
didn't
reach.
and
so
cases
such
as
evidenced
in
cornman
in
which
my
friend
solicitor
general
finds
very
comfort
do
not
trouble
me
at
all.
they
seem
--
may
have
wholly
consistent
with
position
we
take
here,
that
voting
qualifications
may
be
a
matter
within
the
can
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
but
this
particular
qualification
that
we
are
defending
in
this
case
is
not
long
that
either
this
court
or
the
congress
can
rationally
say
false
or
afoul
of
the
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
principal
burden
of
my
argument
in
chief,
was
that
to
sustain
the
statute
would
be
to
replace
a
system
of
constitutional
federalism,
with
a
system
of
congressional
federalism,
and
i
undertook
to
suggest
you
that
this
seems
peculiarly
inappropriate,
with
regard
to
the
political
arrangements
of
the
states
that
congress
should
be
allowed
to
decide
for
itself
the
extent
of
its
power
to
order
the
political
arrangements
in
texas
and
other
states.
many
years
ago
george
brayton
wrote
an
article
on
the
chicago
law
review,
called
empire
to
the
federal
system.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
one
of
the
highest
functions
of
this
court,
but
when
disputes
arise
between
congress
and
the
states
as
to
the
respect
of
powers,
we
can't
ask
congress
to
decide,
whether
it
is
safe
or
out?
we
come
here,
because
this
court
in
a
tradition
of
marbury
v.
madison,
must
make
that
decision.
i
think
that
it
would
not
be
only
constitutional
federalism
could
be
jeopardized
by
a
decision
against
us
here,
but
we
would
also
run
a
great
risk
of
replacing
constitutional
liberty
with
congressional
liberty,
because
i
have
the
difficulty
that
justice
harlan
indicated
from
the
bench,
with
regard
to
footnote
10
in
the
morgan
opinion,
and
it
is
hard
to
see
what
congress
might
not
do
if
congress
is
to
be
given
as
broader
scope
as
is
argued
under
section
5
of
fourteenth
amendment.
it
is
true
as
the
solicitor
general
says
that
section
2
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
all
--
probably
as
little
used,
as
ineffective
a
provision
as
appears
in
the
constitution,
but
it
is
there,
and
i
do
not
think
that
constitutional
provisions
wither
away
by
(inaudible),
or
the
words
that
were
adopted
by
the
country
in
section
2
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
are
less
important
today,
simply
because
they
have
not
been
invoked
in
other
occasions
in
which
they
might
have
been
appropriate.
thank
you
very
much,
mr.
chief
justice.
