mr.
gary
k.
nelson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
might
just
briefly
comment
on
some
of
the
questions
that
were
just
asked
concerning
the
literacy
in
the
indian
nation
and
the
reasons
for
not
registering
in
the
interim
period.
i
think
there
is
a
combination
of
factors
that
are
exceedingly
frightening
to
me
as
a
chief
legal
officer
of
the
state,
which
has
a
large
indian
population.
i
think
one
of
the
problems
is
that
the
indians,
since
1800
have
by
and
large
rejected
federal
government's
effort
to
bring
them
into
the
mainstream
of
this
country's
processes,
whether
it's
by
language,
by
government
or
any
other
criteria,
education
that
you
want
to
weigh.
and
i
think
this
is
a
reason
in
addition
to
the
actual
factual
matter
that
the
communications
on
the
reservation
are
totally
inadequate
to
take
any
information
to
the
indian
nation
and
i
don't
know
what
the
solution
is
to
it,
but
they
have
exactly
three
jurisdictions
that
they're
concerned
with,
not
any
one
of
which
has
full
responsibility
over
them;
the
federal
government,
the
state
in
which
they're
in
and
their
own
nation
and
it
is
a
pressing
problem.
yet
i
don't
think
that
it
is
right
for
them
to
be
able,
in
a
sense,
without
having
any
basis
in
fact
or
knowledge
to
legislate
in
the
state
of
arizona
and
i
think
they
could
particularly
in
two
counties,
if
they
chose
to
do
so.
so
it's
a
problem
which
we
are
really
concerned
and
we
don't
purport
to
offer
here
and
would
this
be
the
proper
form,
all
of
the
answers
to
this
question.
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
i
believe
that
is
correct.
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
nothing,
but
they
don't
choose
to
do
so
mr.
justice
marshall,
they
have
never
chosen
to
do
so.
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
but
there
is
no
evidence,
there
was
no
evidence
before
congress
and
there
is
no
evidence
here
as
a
basis
of
these
admittedly
short-term
opportunities
and
affidavits
that
they
cared
to
do
so,
that
they
cared
to
come
in
and
register
and
run
the
two
counties
even
though
they
wouldn't
admittedly
be
subject
to
paying
any
of
the
county's
taxes.
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
as
far
as
i
know,
they
are
your
honor.
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
i
think
it's
not
quite
that
simply
explained
that
they
haven't
--
but
they
haven't
shown
the
motivation
and
certainly
that's
true.
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
well,
we
oppose
it
on
the
constitutional
grounds
that
we
don't
think
it
can
be
done
this
way,
plus,
we
oppose
it
on
the
main
ground
as
mr.
mcgowan
had
mentioned
concerning
the
factor
that
so
much
of
arizona's
legislation,
both
constitutional
and
statutory
legislation
is
submitted
to
the
people
and
if
they
can't
read
and
understand
the
language,
how
can
they
possibly
intelligently
vote
and
then
the
odds
are
increased
that
they
will
vote
in
a
block
like
someone
suggests
they
should
vote
as
opposed
to
making
an
independent
decision
and
i
just
think
that's
a
terrible
risk
for
arizona
had
to
take.
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
yes.
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
certainly.
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
i
just
don't
think
it
would
be
done,
it
isn't
done.
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
they
finally
elected
one
member
of
the
house
of
representatives,
which
is
the
lower
body
and
he
served
one
term,
his
name
was
in
lloyd
house,
he
was
a
navajo
and
he
tried
to
run
for
congress
and
was
beaten
in
a
three-way
primary.
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
and
i
would
ask
mr.
mcgowan
to
check
his
recollection
that,
that's
the
only
navajo
that's
been
elected.
there
have
been,
i
believe,
some
other
indians
apaches
perhaps
yavapais,
who
were
either
totally
indian
or
part
indians
who
have
been
elected
but
i
just
can't
recall,
lloyd
house,
i
know.
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
oh,
yes,
oh
yes,
i
think
there
are
at
least
two
districts
in
arizona
where
if
all
the
indians
voted,
even
the
ones
that
perhaps
are
registered,
they
could
elect
a
representative
if
they
chose
to
do
so.
now
if
i
may
briefly
touch
upon
what
i
think
is
the
most
critical
issue
before
this
court,
i
sort
of
feel
a
little
bit
like
quoting
lincoln's
words,
i
think
it's
appropriate
although
it's
a
different
form.
he
found
himself
at
gettysburg,
i
think
we
are
really
met
here
today
in
this
particular
question
of
the
18-year-old
vote
to
find
out
if
the
country
so
conceived
as
ours
has,
can
long
endure.
i
think
that
is
really
the
ultimate
test
that
we're
faced
with
when
we
brush
all
the
cases
aside,
all
the
decisions
and
look
simply
at
the
fourteenth
amendment.
even
though
we
may
call
it
abortive
or
an
anachronism,
or
whatever
we
call
it,
i
don't
see
how
we
can
conceivably
sweep
it
away.
i
think
i
was
very
encouraged
to
hear
the
solicitor
general
mention
the
fact
that
we
still
consider
the
electoral
college,
which
i
think
is
a
classic
example
of
what
most
of
the
people
and
most
of
the
states
for
different
reasons
and
with
different
degrees
of
how
they
would
like
to
change
it
totally
in
apposite
to
our
system
today
and
it's
still
there.
i
am
finding
myself
in
a
position
where
personally
i
have
for
years
circulated
petitions
to
get
the
18-year-old
vote
question
on
the
arizona
ballot.
there
is
no
question
in
my
mind
that
will
happen.
that's
not
the
issue,
but
it's
a
very
dangerous
situation
that
we
find
ourselves
in,
because
i
think
historically
this
is
where
governments
tend
to
make
the
first
shortcut
that
leads
to
its
eventual
downfall
and
that's
in
an
area
where
everybody
sees
a
need.
it's
a
good
thing.
it's
not
an
evil
thing
that
we're
doing,
so
why
not
do
it
the
easy
way,
why
wait
as
we
did
for
the
female
suffrage
amendment,
why
wait
for
that
long
drawn
out
difficult
political
process
of
constitutional
amendment,
everybody
really
wants
it
or
whether
majority
of
congress
wouldn't
have
voted
in
the
first
place
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
we
see
from
the
briefs
in
this
case
and
from
the
concurring
opinion
of
judge
mckinnon.
the
legislative
history
is
not
really
conclusive
and
it's
never
been
enforced
in
its
original
provision
so,
why
not
forget
it
and
i
think
that
would
be
a
tragedy.
i
think
you
can
explain
all
of
the
parts
of
the
section
--
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
i
think
we
must,
i
think
we
must
construe
them
all
and
the
fact
that
it
hasn't
been
enforced.
i
can't
see
any
logical
or
legal
argument
that,
that
makes
any
difference
whatsoever.
now
i
can
see
a
very
sound
argument
to
be
made
that
section
5
may
give
a
concurrent
remedy
other
than
the
remedy
of
simply
reducing
a
state's
representation
in
converse.
i
can
see
that
as
an
argument,
as
a
logical
argument
that
this
court
might
adopt
in
1970
as
opposed
to
perhaps
what
was
in
vogue
in
the
1800’s
of
potentially
reducing
the
representation
in
the
federal
legislation.
but
to
say
--
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
to
congress
the
power,
i
am
sorry
--
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
an
alternative
remedy
--
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
yes,
sir,
yes
your
honor.
but
to
say
that
the
words
are
not
there,
that
the
numbers
are
not
there
or
to
say
that
well
all
it
did
was
really
put
into
the
constitution,
what
was
the
acceptance
standard
in
1865
or
66,
the
generally
acceptable
minimums
is
to
avoid
the
question,
so
what
if
it
indeed,
that
is
what
it
did
and
if
indeed
they
shouldn't
be
there
today
that
maybe
true,
but
we
can
change
it
by
congress.
yes,
excuse
me.
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
i
think
it
sets
a
minimum
age
for
voting
at
21
years
under
which
the
federal
government
has
no
authority
to
enforce
any
sanctions
against
the
state
whatsoever
for
allowing
people,
or
for
disallowing
people
under
the
age
of
21
to
vote.
i
think
it
says
that
very
clearly.
now,
granted
perhaps
if
we
had
been
drafting
the
fourteenth
amendment,
we
could
have
set
it
better
or
more
straight
forwardly,
but
i
do
not
think
we
construe
a
way
the
fact
that
it
says
to
the
state’s
states,
“if
you
do
not
allow
your
people
who
are
21
years
old
or
older
to
vote,
the
federal
government
can
come
in
under
this
amendment
and
sanction
you.”
now
i
think
it
has
to
say
if
you
do
allow
all
people
under
21
years
of
age
or
older
to
vote,
then
the
federal
government
has
no
authority
to
come
in
and
sanction
you
on
that
purpose
and
i
just
--
it's
inconceivable
to
me
quite
frankly
that
we
could
come
to
any
other
conclusion
in
spite
of
the
sound
constitutional
lawyers
and
judges,
whose
opinion
are
to
the
contrary
and
it
seems
that
we
wouldn't
even
be
bending
the
constitution,
we'd
simply
be
breaking
it
and
while
it
would
be
for
a
good
purpose
and
a
result
that
i
personally
want
to
see
accomplished,
i
think
it
would
just
be
the
first
step
and
that
every
other
step
then,
would
be
a
little
easier
even
if
it
were
more
controversial.
and
i
think
this
is
just
the
history
of
how
governments
finally
conceive,
have
gone
wrong
because
they
took
a
step
a
little
outside
the
law
because
well,
everybody
wanted
to
do
it
and
the
way
to
do
it
within
the
law
was
a
little
cumbersome,
we
had
some
problems,
we
had
some
unrest
perhaps
that’s
attributable
risk
although
i
think
that
is
an
erroneous
conclusion.
and
i
just
would
urge
to
this
court
to
think
very,
very
carefully
about
ignoring
as
congress
had,
that
is
one
check
that's
gone,
as
unfortunately
the
president
has,
even
though
he
stated
that
he
thought
it
was
unconstitutional.
that
is
two
stripes
and
there
is
only
one
check
left
and
unquestionably
the
congress
had
the
power
to
do
what
they
did,
this
court
has
the
power
to
sanction
it.
i
do
not
think
either
body
has
the
authority.
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
might
just
briefly
comment
on
some
of
the
questions
that
were
just
asked
concerning
the
literacy
in
the
indian
nation
and
the
reasons
for
not
registering
in
the
interim
period.
i
think
there
is
a
combination
of
factors
that
are
exceedingly
frightening
to
me
as
a
chief
legal
officer
of
the
state,
which
has
a
large
indian
population.
i
think
one
of
the
problems
is
that
the
indians,
since
1800
have
by
and
large
rejected
federal
government's
effort
to
bring
them
into
the
mainstream
of
this
country's
processes,
whether
it's
by
language,
by
government
or
any
other
criteria,
education
that
you
want
to
weigh.
and
i
think
this
is
a
reason
in
addition
to
the
actual
factual
matter
that
the
communications
on
the
reservation
are
totally
inadequate
to
take
any
information
to
the
indian
nation
and
i
don't
know
what
the
solution
is
to
it,
but
they
have
exactly
three
jurisdictions
that
they're
concerned
with,
not
any
one
of
which
has
full
responsibility
over
them;
the
federal
government,
the
state
in
which
they're
in

their

and
it
is
a
pressing
problem.
yet
i
don't
think
that
it

in
a

without
having
any

in

in
the
state
of
arizona
and
i
think
they
could
particularly

two
counties,
if
they
chose
to
do
so.
so
it's
a
problem
which
we
are
really
concerned
and
we
don't
purport
to
offer
here
and
would
this
be
the
proper
form,
all
of
the
answers
to
this
question.
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
i
believe
that
is
correct.
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
nothing,
but
they
don't
choose
to
do
so
mr.
justice
marshall,
they
have
never
chosen
to
do
so.
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
but
there
is
no
evidence,
there
was
no
evidence
before
congress
and
there
is
no
evidence
here
as
a
basis
of
these
admittedly
short-term
opportunities
and
affidavits
that
they
cared
to
do
so,
that
they
cared
to
come
in
and
register
and
run
the
two
counties
even
though
they
wouldn't
admittedly
be
subject
to
paying
any
of
the
county's
taxes.
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
as
far
as
i

they
are
your
honor.
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
i
think
it's
not
quite
that
simply
explained
that
they
haven't
--
but
they
haven't
shown
the
motivation
and
certainly
that's
true.
mr.

well,
we
oppose

certainly.

i
just
don't

mr.
gary

oh,
yes,
oh
yes,
i
think
there
are
at
least
two
districts
in
arizona
where
if
all
the
indians
voted,
even
the

that
perhaps

the
people
and
most
of
the
states
for
different
reasons
and
with
different
degrees
of
how
they
would
like
to
change
it
totally
in
apposite
to
our
system
today
and
it's
still
there.
i
am
finding
myself
in
a
position
where
personally
i
have
for
years
circulated
petitions
to
get
the
18-year-old
vote
question
on
the
arizona
ballot.
there
is
no
question
in
my
mind
that
will
happen.
that's
not
the
issue,
but
it's
a
very
dangerous
situation
that
we
find
ourselves
in,
because
i
think
historically
this
is
where
governments
tend
to
make
the
first
shortcut
that
leads
to
its
eventual
downfall
and
that's
in
an
area
where
everybody
sees
a
need.
it's
a
good
thing.
it's
not
an
evil
thing
that
we're
doing,
so
why
not
do
it
the
easy
way,
why
wait
as
we
did
for
the
female
suffrage
amendment,
why
wait
for
that
long
drawn
out
difficult
political
process
of
constitutional
amendment,
everybody
really
wants
it
or
whether
majority
of
congress
wouldn't
have
voted
in
the
first
place
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
we
see
from
the
briefs
in
this
case
and
from
the
concurring
opinion
of
judge
mckinnon.
the
legislative
history
is
not
really
conclusive
and
it's
never
been
enforced
in
its
original
provision
so,
why
not
forget
it
and
i
think
that
would
be
a
tragedy.
i
think
you
can
explain
all
of
the
parts
of
the
section
--
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
i
think
we
must,
i
think
we
must
construe
them
all
and
the
fact
that
it
hasn't
been
enforced.
i
can't
see
any
logical
or
legal
argument
that,
that
makes
any
difference
whatsoever.
now
i
can
see
a
very
sound
argument
to
be
made
that
section
5
may
give
a
concurrent
remedy
other
than
the
remedy
of
simply
reducing
a
state's
representation
in
converse.
i
can
see
that
as
an
argument,
as
a
logical
argument
that
this
court
might
adopt
in
1970
as
opposed
to
perhaps
what
was
in
vogue
in
the
1800’s
of
potentially
reducing
the
representation
in
the
federal
legislation.
but
to
say
--
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
to
congress
the
power,
i
am
sorry
--
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
an
alternative
remedy
--
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
yes,
sir,
yes
your
honor.
but
to
say
that
the
words
are
not
there,
that
the
numbers
are
not
there
or
to
say
that
well
all
it
did
was
really
put
into
the
constitution,
what
was
the
acceptance
standard
in
1865
or
66,
the
generally
acceptable
minimums
is
to
avoid
the
question,
so
what
if
it
indeed,
that
is
what
it
did
and
if
indeed
they
shouldn't
be
there
today
that
maybe
true,
but
we
can
change
it
by
congress.
yes,
excuse
me.
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
i
think
it
sets
a
minimum
age
for
voting
at
21
years
under
which
the
federal
government
has
no
authority
to
enforce
any
sanctions
against
the
state
whatsoever
for
allowing
people,
or
for
disallowing
people
under
the
age
of
21
to
vote.
i
think
it
says
that
very
clearly.
now,
granted
perhaps
if
we
had
been
drafting
the
fourteenth
amendment,
we
could
have
set
it
better
or
more
straight
forwardly,
but
i
do
not
think
we
construe
a
way
the
fact
that
it
says
to
the
state’s
states,
“if
you
do
not
allow
your
people
who
are
21
years
old
or
older
to
vote,
the
federal
government
can
come
in
under
this
amendment
and
sanction
you.”
now
i
think
it
has
to
say
if
you
do
allow
all
people
under
21
years
of
age
or
older
to
vote,
then
the
federal
government
has
no
authority
to
come
in
and
sanction
you
on
that
purpose
and
i
just
--
it's
inconceivable
to
me
quite
frankly
that
we
could
come
to
any
other
conclusion
in
spite
of
the
sound
constitutional
lawyers
and
judges,
whose
opinion
are
to
the
contrary
and
it
seems
that
we
wouldn't
even
be
bending
the
constitution,
we'd
simply
be
breaking
it
and
while
it
would
be
for
a
good
purpose
and
a
result
that
i
personally
want
to
see
accomplished,
i
think
it
would
just
be
the
first
step
and
that
every
other
step
then,
would
be
a
little
easier
even
if
it
were
more
controversial.
and
i
think
this
is
just
the
history
of
how
governments
finally
conceive,
have
gone
wrong
because
they
took
a
step
a
little
outside
the
law
because
well,
everybody
wanted
to
do
it
and
the
way
to
do
it
within
the
law
was
a
little
cumbersome,
we
had
some
problems,
we
had
some
unrest
perhaps
that’s
attributable
risk
although
i
think
that
is
an
erroneous
conclusion.
and
i
just
would
urge
to
this
court
to
think
very,
very
carefully
about
ignoring
as
congress
had,
that
is
one
check
that's
gone,
as
unfortunately
the
president
has,
even
though
he
stated
that
he
thought
it
was
unconstitutional.
that
is
two
stripes
and
there
is
only
one
check
left
and
unquestionably
the
congress
had
the
power
to
do
what
they
did,
this
court
has
the
power
to
sanction
it.
i
do
not
think
either
body
has
the
authority.
