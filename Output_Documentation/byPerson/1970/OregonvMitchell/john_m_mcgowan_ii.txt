mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
first
i
would
like
to
correct
or
restate
some
of
the
facts
stated
by
the
solicitor
general.
in
the
government's
brief
the
figure
used
is
73,400
rather
than
87,000
is
the
number
in
arizona
not
registered.
and
since
the
order
of
justice
douglas
on
august
21,
only
18
people
have
registered
to
vote
in
all
of
the
fourteen
counties
of
arizona
rather
than
21
in
the
state.
in
the
appendix
of
arizona's
brief
we
have
attached
copies
of
all
of
the
county
records
of
arizona
setting
forth
the
number
that
did
register
and
the
total
population
of
the
said
county
as
revealed
by
the
latest
census
figures.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
yes
sir,
and
it
was
given
due
notoriety
in
all
the
papers,
the
television,
radio,
so
it
was
broad
casted,
but
they
had
the
opportunity
for
three
weeks
mr.
justice
to
register.
it
is
arizona's
position
that
there
it
was
not
adequate
basis
given
for
the
act
--
for
the
voting
rights
act
of
1970.
arizona
was
not
give
opportunity
to
be
heard
and
in
this
court's
decision,
in
the
morgan
case
the
court
satisfied
itself
that
pertinent
factors
were
used
in
that
congressional
decision.
here
there
is
nothing
before
this
court
to
which
it
can
perceive
a
basis
upon
which
congress
acted
as
it
did
in
placing
the
1970
act.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
they
were
not
invited
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
no,
no
sir.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
that's
correct.
i
know
here
we
are
in
arizona.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
yes
sir.
from
what
is
put
forward,
it
appears
that
congress
merely
took
cognizance,
that
literacy
test
have
been
used
in
the
past
as
a
tool
of
deliberating
invidious
discrimination.
that
has
never
been
the
case
in
arizona.
arizona
has
people
from
all
parts
of
the
country
who
reside
there,
that
have
moved
there
and
as
this
court
held
in
the
gaston
opinion
that,
in
footnote
8,
where
it
very
carefully
said,
“we
have
no
occasion
to
decide
whether
this
act
would
permit
reinstatement
of
literacy
test
in
that
face
of
a
rational
disparate
educational
literacy
achievement,
for
which
the
government
bore
no
responsibility.”
the
government’s
brief
quotes,
honorable
raymond
nakai,
chairman
of
navajo
nation
to
the
effect
that
the
only
reason
advanced
by
the
number
of
illiterate,
the
high
number
of
illiterates
not
registered
in
arizona
and
new
mexico
was
the
fact
of
arizona’s
literacy
test,
but
no
other
fact
to
substantiate
that
statement.
arizona
has
a
great
bulk
of
the
navajo
people.
they
live
in
a
rather
isolated
area.
new
mexico’s
indian
population
is
largely
situated
in
pueblos,
that’s
--
that
fact
does
not
bear
up
under
the
--
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
no
sir,
by
and
large
no
sir,
not.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
it’s
a
personal
opinion,
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
it’s
a
spoken
language.
it
was
a
written
language
as
of
about
50
years
ago.
the
gentleman
who
comprised
the
written
language
passed
away
about
2
years
ago.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
in
the
english
language.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
schools,
they
talk
in
the
english
language.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
yes
sir,
since
the
treaty
of
1967
or
1968
when
the
federal
government
promised
a
school
teacher
for
every
so
many
indian
children.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
mr.
chief
justice,
by
the
very
nature
of
the
geography
of
the
area,
the
children
are
taken
into
towns
like
winslow,
phoenix
and
other
places
and
educate
them.
some
of
them
have
never
liked
that
approach
and
therefore,
they
have
not
gone.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
yes
sir.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
in
the
gaston
case
where
the
footnote
is
quoted
and
in
this
court
in
last
june
in
the
edwards
case
in
striking
down
the
(inaudible)
theory
saying
that
the
state
within
a
state
concept
must
go.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
we
have
a
case
in
arizona
that’s
warren
trading
post
versus
arizona
trading
commission,
1965
in
which
this
court
said,
“in
compliance
to
these
treaty
obligations,
the
federal
government
has
provided
for
the
roads,
education
and
other
services
needed
by
the
indians.”
the
court
concluded
and
i
quote,
“since
federal
legislation
has
left
the
state
with
no
duties,
all
responsibilities,
respecting
the
reservation
indians,
we
cannot
believe
that
congress
intended
to
leave
to
the
state
to
privilege
of
leveling
state
privilege
tax.
by
the
very
language
of
the
warren
trading
post,
arizona
was
bought
within
the
exception
provided
in
footnote
8
of
a
gaston
decision.
as
was
determined
in
warren
trading
post
case,
arizona
clearly
has
no
responsibility
for
the
literacy
or
lack
of
it
of
a
large
part
of
its
citizens
by
virtue
of
federal
responsibility.
arizona
has
always
spent
a
great
amount
of
its
fund
on
education,
approximately
70%
and
arizona’s
constitution
was
enacted
in
the
hay
day
of
direct
democracy.
in
fact,
the
former
chief
justice
of
this
court,
the
former
president,
delayed
arizona’s
admission
by
virtue
of
the
recall
of
judges.
we
have
a
very
easily
amended
constitution.
5%
of
the
voters
of
arizona
may
refer
to
the
voters
of
arizona,
any
bill
passed
for
the
legislature.
for
that
reason,
no
bill
becomes
a
law
for
90
days
following
the
general
of
legislature
to
give
any
5%
of
the
people
the
right
to
petition
for
referral
to
themselves.
by
virtue
of
that
fact,
it’s
awkward
situation
to
let
someone
who
cannot
read
what
he
has
to
decide
upon;
that
he
has
a
right
to
pass
upon
the
constitution
or
the
ordinary
statute
to
the
state
because
it’s
easy
to
refer
a
measure.
no
bill
becomes
a
law
until
90
days
have
passed,
unless
two-thirds
of
the
legislature
has
declared
it
to
be
an
emergency.
it’s
for
this
reason
that
arizona
has
always
spent
a
great
portion
of
it’s
taxable
wealth
on
education.
our
constitution
is
amended
every
2
years,
we
have
3
or
4
this
year,
which
is
the
smaller
number
than
usual,
yet
to
say
that
they
may
listen
to
radios
and
televisions
is
alright,
is
about
candidates.
but
when
it
comes
to
the
voting
on
detailed
legislation
and
the
constitutional
amendments,
it
makes
it
a
rather
difficult
proposition
to
defend.
now
we
have
in
arizona
a
case
that
says
that
the
right
to
drive
an
automobile
is
a
right,
not
a
privilege.
no
one
has
ever
said
that
a
person
who
has
impaired
eyesight
shouldn't
have
the
right
to
have
that
driver’s
license.
the
same
way,
if
illiterates
are
given
the
right
to
the
ballot,
they
not
only
or
will
not
be
able
to
sufficiently
use
that,
but
it
will
impede
the
right
of
someone
else
who
has
taken
the
time
to
learn
to
read
and
write.
no
have
arizona
ever
used
this
as
a
test
or
device,
to
prevent
someone
from
voting,
that
would
be
one
thing,
but
we
have
never
done
that.
it
was
only
used
to
ensure
that
the
ballot
would
be
understood
and
that
a
great
number
of
people
that
we
elect
and
the
ease
by
which
we
amend
our
constitution
referral
measures,
would
not
be
given
the
whole
protection
of
that
process,
if
literates
are
given
the
ballot.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
the
only
conclusion
your
honor,
i
could
reach
was
that
there
was
not
a
demand
for
it.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
not
the
demand
for
it.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
i
don’t
think
the
percentage
would
increase
much
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
as
a
matter
of,
if
one
person
is
allowed
to
vote
as
an
illiterate,
that
puts
our
whole
process
in
jeopardy.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
because
your
honor,
our
whole
system
in
arizona
is
built
upon
the
people
reserving
to
themselves
the
legislative
process
and
if
a
person
has
the
right,
equivalent
to
someone
who
has
learned
to
read
and
write,
go
in
there
and
negative
his
vote
by
just
blind
voting
and
then
it
makes
a
mockery
of
our
system.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
largely,
your
honor,
yes
sir,
roughly
21%
of
arizona
has
mainly
spanish
derivatives.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
the
constitution
says
they
must
read
the
constitution
of
united
states
to
be
able
to
and
to
write
--
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
in
english.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it
has
to
do
with
the
geographical
distribution
of
that.
some
people
must
come
15-16
miles
to
vote.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
21,
august
your
honor
and
it
was
to
expire
on
september
14,
so
there
were
three
full
weeks
in
which
our
primary
was
on
the
8th
--
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
but
there
was
much
interest
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
primary
was
two
weeks
after
you
signed
it
and
so
a
consciousness
of
election
was
upon
everyone.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
yes,
sure
your
honor
they
have.
25%
of
arizona
is
under
their
sole
jurisdiction.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
so
that
they
have
their
own
tribal
government.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
quite
possible
sir.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
lack
of
interest,
mr.
chief
justice.
thank
you.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
first
i
would
like
to
correct
or
restate
some
of
the
facts
stated
by
the
solicitor
general.
in
the
government's
brief
the
figure
used
is
73,400
rather
than
87,000
is
the
number
in
arizona
not
registered.
and
since
the
order
of
justice
douglas
on
august
21,
only
18
people
have
registered
to
vote
in
all
of
the
fourteen
counties
of
arizona
rather
than
21
in
the
state.
in
the
appendix
of
arizona's
brief
we
have
attached
copies
of
all
of
the
county
records
of
arizona
setting
forth
the
number
that
did
register
and
the
total
population
of
the
said
county
as
revealed
by
the
latest
census
figures.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
yes
sir,
and
it
was
given
due
notoriety
in
all
the
papers,
the
television,
radio,
so
it
was
broad
casted,
but
they
had
the
opportunity
for
three
weeks
mr.
justice
to
register.
it
is
arizona's
position
that
there
it
was
not
adequate
basis
given
for
the
act
--
for
the
voting
rights
act
of
1970.
arizona
was
not
give
opportunity
to
be
heard
and
in
this
court's
decision,
in
the
morgan
case
the
court
satisfied
itself
that
pertinent
factors
were
used
in
that
congressional
decision.
here
there
is
nothing
before
this
court
to
which
it
can
perceive
a
basis
upon
which
congress
acted
as
it
did
in
placing
the
1970
act.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
they
were
not
invited
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
no,
no
sir.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
that's
correct.
i
know
here
we
are
in
arizona.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
yes
sir.
from
what
is
put
forward,
it
appears
that
congress
merely
took
cognizance,
that
literacy
test
have
been
used
in
the
past
as
a
tool
of
deliberating
invidious
discrimination.
that
has
never
been
the
case
in
arizona.
arizona
has
people
from
all
parts
of
the
country
who
reside
there,
that
have
moved
there
and
as
this
court
held
in
the
gaston
opinion
that,
in
footnote
8,
where
it
very
carefully
said,
“we
have
no
occasion
to
decide
whether
this
act
would
permit
reinstatement
of
literacy
test
in
that
face
of

which
the

mr.
john

yes
sir,
since
the
treaty
of
1967
or
1968
when
the
federal
government
promised
a
school
teacher
for
every
so
many
indian
children.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
mr.
chief
justice,
by
the
very
nature
of
the
geography
of
the
area,
the
children
are
taken
into
towns
like
winslow,
phoenix
and
other
places
and
educate
them.
some
of
them
have
never
liked
that
approach
and
therefore,
they
have
not
gone.
mr.
john
m.

yes
sir.
mr.
john

in
the
gaston
case
where
the
footnote
is
quoted
and
in

court
in

in
striking
down

theory
saying
that

within

mr.

mcgowan
ii
we
have
a
case
in
arizona
that’s
warren
trading
post
versus
arizona
trading
commission,
1965
in
which
this
court
said,
“in
compliance
to
these
treaty
obligations,
the
federal
government
has
provided
for
the
roads,
education
and
other
services
needed
by
the
indians.”
the
court
concluded
and
i
quote,
“since
federal
legislation
has
left
the
state
with
no

respecting
the
reservation
indians,
we
cannot
believe
that

by
the
very
language
of
the
warren
trading
post,
arizona
was
bought
within
the
exception
provided
in
footnote
8
of
a
gaston
decision.
as
was
determined
in
warren
trading
post
case,
arizona
clearly
has
no
responsibility
for
the
literacy
or
lack
of
it
of
a
large
part
of
its
citizens
by
virtue
of
federal
responsibility.
arizona
has
always
spent
a
great
amount
of
its
fund
on
education,
approximately
70%
and
arizona’s
constitution
was
enacted
in
the
hay
day
of
direct
democracy.
in
fact,
the
former
chief
justice
of
this
court,
the
former
president,
delayed
arizona’s
admission
by
virtue
of
the
recall
of
judges.
we
have
a
very
easily
amended
constitution.
5%
of
the
voters
of
arizona
may
refer
to
the
voters
of
arizona,
any
bill
passed
for
the
legislature.
for
that
reason,
no
bill
becomes
a
law
for
90
days
following
the
general
of
legislature
to
give
any
5%
of
the
people
the
right
to
petition
for
referral
to
themselves.
by
virtue
of
that
fact,
it’s
awkward
situation
to
let
someone
who
cannot
read
what
he
has
to
decide
upon;
that
he
has
a
right
to
pass
upon
the
constitution
or
the
ordinary
statute
to
the
state
because
it’s
easy
to
refer
a
measure.
no
bill
becomes
a
law
until
90
days
have
passed,
unless
two-thirds
of
the
legislature
has
declared
it
to
be
an
emergency.
it’s
for
this
reason
that
arizona
has
always
spent
a
great
portion
of
it’s
taxable
wealth
on
education.
our
constitution
is
amended
every
2
years,
we
have
3
or
4
this
year,
which
is
the
smaller
number
than
usual,
yet
to
say
that
they
may
listen
to
radios
and
televisions
is
alright,
is
about
candidates.
but
when
it
comes
to
the
voting
on
detailed
legislation
and
the
constitutional
amendments,
it
makes
it
a
rather
difficult
proposition
to
defend.
now
we
have
in
arizona
a
case
that
says
that
the
right
to
drive
an
automobile
is
a
right,
not
a
privilege.
no
one
has
ever
said
that
a
person
who
has
impaired
eyesight
shouldn't
have
the
right
to
have
that
driver’s
license.
the
same
way,
if
illiterates
are
given
the
right
to
the
ballot,
they
not
only
or
will
not
be
able
to
sufficiently
use
that,
but
it
will
impede
the
right
of
someone
else
who
has
taken
the
time
to
learn
to
read
and
write.
no
have
arizona
ever
used
this
as
a
test
or
device,
to
prevent
someone
from
voting,
that
would
be
one
thing,
but
we
have
never
done
that.
it
was
only
used
to
ensure
that
the
ballot
would
be
understood
and
that
a
great
number
of
people
that
we
elect
and
the
ease
by
which
we
amend
our
constitution
referral
measures,
would
not
be
given
the
whole
protection
of
that
process,
if
literates
are
given
the
ballot.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
the
only
conclusion
your
honor,
i
could
reach
was
that
there
was
not
a
demand
for
it.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
not
the
demand
for
it.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
i
don’t
think
the
percentage
would
increase
much
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
as
a
matter
of,
if
one
person
is
allowed
to
vote
as
an
illiterate,
that
puts
our
whole
process
in
jeopardy.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
because
your
honor,
our
whole
system
in
arizona
is
built
upon
the
people
reserving
to
themselves
the
legislative
process
and
if
a
person
has
the
right,
equivalent
to
someone
who
has
learned
to
read
and
write,
go
in
there
and
negative
his
vote
by
just
blind
voting
and
then
it
makes
a
mockery
of
our
system.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
largely,
your
honor,
yes
sir,
roughly
21%
of
arizona
has
mainly
spanish
derivatives.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
the
constitution
says
they
must
read
the
constitution
of
united
states
to
be
able
to
and
to
write
--
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
in
english.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it
has
to
do
with
the
geographical
distribution
of
that.
some
people
must
come
15-16
miles
to
vote.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
21,
august
your
honor
and
it
was
to
expire
on
september
14,
so
there
were
three
full
weeks
in
which
our
primary
was
on
the
8th
--
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
but
there
was
much
interest
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
primary
was
two
weeks
after
you
signed
it
and
so
a
consciousness
of
election
was
upon
everyone.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
yes,
sure
your
honor
they
have.
25%
of
arizona
is
under
their
sole
jurisdiction.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
so
that
they
have
their
own
tribal
government.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
quite
possible
sir.
mr.
john
m.
mcgowan
ii
lack
of
interest,
mr.
chief
justice.
thank
you.
