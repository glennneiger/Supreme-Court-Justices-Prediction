mr.
robert
m.
robson
mr.
chief
justice,
gentlemen
of
the
court.
i
hate
to
keep
flogging
this,
(inaudible)
to
death,
but
it
looks
like
that
is
the
name
of
the
game
all
afternoon.
i
think
that
we
have
heard
enough
arguments
that
i
can
assume
that
this
court
will
recognize
that
congress
at
least
directly
by
the
constitution
of
united
states
has
no
right
to
enfranchise
any
citizen
to
vote
per
se.
that
congress
can
legislatively,
to
prevent
discrimination
under
the
equal
protection
clause
is
not
denied.
the
combination
of
the
article
xiv,
section
1
and
section
5
certainly
has
be
and
allowed
to
be
exercised
by
this
court
in
a
good
many
areas,
but
i
think
when
you
look
at
the
section
14
as
a
whole,
you'll
find
that
really
the
intent
of
the
enactors
of
that
piece
of
legislation
were
attempting
to
stop
discrimination
against
citizens
of
the
united
states
in
an
area
where
discrimination
had
been
practiced
for
a
100
years
because
of
race,
color,
and
national
origin.
they
were
so
unsure
about
section
14
and
what
it
did
that
they
enacted
section
15
to
make
sure
that
they
weren't
understood,
that
they
weren't
misunderstood.
i
think
katzenbach
and
i
want
to
point
this
out
because
i
do
not
think
it
has
been
pointed
out
in
any
argument
today,
note
14
shows
that
expressly
in
the
constitutional
convention
of
state
of
new
york
there
was
a
great
deal
of
discussion
about
national
origin.
i
cannot
help
but
believe
that
this
court
has
taken
a
real
good
look
at
that
when
they
decided
katzenbach.
contrary
to
the
argument
of
the
solicitor
general,
i
do
think
that
there
was
in
this
court's
mind
invidious
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race,
color,
creed
or
national
origin.
mr.
robert
m.
robson
i
am
talking
about
katzenbach
versus
morgan,
the
case.
mr.
robert
m.
robson
i
was
talking
about
katzenbach
--
now,
you
got
me
confused,
i
might
not
on
your
wavelength.
mr.
robert
m.
robson
i
understand
that,
but
the
new
york
constitution
provision
that
was
struck
down
in
katzenbach
as
i
understand
and
in
one
of
the
footnotes,
in
that
case,
it
was
clearly
pointed
out.
i
think
it
is
on
page
645
or
654,
654
to
be
exact,
384
u.s.
654.
i
think
that
that
footnote
indicates
that
this
was
being
lifted
because
there
is
the
quote
in
there
directly
out
to
constitutional
convention
of
the
state
in
new
york
that
showed
that
they
were
considering
national
origin
as
the
source
for
their
limitation.
i
just
want
to
point
that
out
that
this
was
--
it
was
before
this
court,
it
does
have
some
overtones.
another
thing
that
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court,
and
there
has
been
some
discussion,
at
least
today
but
not
specifically
--
a
specific
--
there
was
this
specific
finding
by
congress
in
the
determination
of
how
they
were
going
to
word
this
section
in
regard
to
the
18-year
old
vote
in
which
they
found
in
exactly
the
language
of
this
court
in
katzenbach,
that
it
was
an
invidious
discrimination
for
the
states
not
to
allow
18
years
of
age
to
vote
because
of
their
military
service
as
required
by
them
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
this
is
i
think
a
syllogism
because
certainly
more
than
half
of
the
18
years
olds
in
this
country
are
women
that
are
not
subject
to
any
federal
service.
the
service
is
required
by
a
federal
act
not
by
a
state
act,
so
there
can't
be
any
state
discrimination
here
and
the
fact
that
of
the
50%
of
the
males
were
all
subject
to
military
service,
only
about
10%
of
them
ever,
ever
served
unless
we
were
in
a
world
war
ii
situation.
i
don't
believe
that
just
because
you
are
old
enough
to
fight,
means
that
you
are
old
enough
necessarily
to
vote.
all
that
means
is
you
are
old
enough
to
take
orders
and
you
have
been
old
enough
to
do
that
since
you
could
understand.
the
other
side
of
the
coin
is
that
if
you
are
too
old
to
fight,
as
i
am
now
considered
to
be
by
my
country
then
you
are
too
old
to
vote
and
i
do
not
think
i
am
too
old
to
vote.
i
would
like
to
point
out
another
argument
that
i
would
like
to
make.
the
rationale
of
the
arguments
that
have
proposed
here
by
the
solicitor
general
are
that
by
a
combination
of
sections
1
and
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
congress
can
do
something
indirectly
which
it
can't
find
in
the
enumeration
of
powers
that
it
may
do
directly.
in
other
words,
by
removing
at
a
step,
by
coming
on
with
an
argument
that
because
we
want
to
enforce
equal
protection
in
the
laws
and
we
don't
want
any
discrimination,
we
can
come
in
the
back
door
and
do
what
we
could
not
do
directly.
i
think
it's
a
parody
on
the
law
and
i
don't
think
it's
an
argument
that
holds
too
much
water,
particularly
in
a
situation
where
there
is
no
particular
discrimination
by
a
state
that
is
really
pervasive
across
the
board,
where
you
can
show
that
any
particular
age
group
or
section
of
the
population
is
really
being
discriminated
anymore
than
another.
here
is
a
group
between
18
and
21
that
are
not
allowed
to
vote.
well,
after
all
at
common
law
and
this
is
our
heritage,
nobody
was
allowed
to
vote
and
nobody
--
and
everybody
was
an
infant
till
they
were
21
years
of
age.
we
have
modified
this
up
and
down,
hither
and
yon
and
we
have
allowed
the
state
legislatures
to
do
this.
but
certainly
up
to
this
point
congress
has
never
attempted
to
do
so.
if
they
can
do
it
in
this
area,
in
the
area
of
the
political
arena,
then
there
is
no
reason
why
the
same
kind
of
argument
cannot
be
carried
over
into
marriage.
we
have
one
of
the
--
we
have
a
terrible
social
problem
with
the
break
up
of
marriage
in
this
country.
there
is
no
reason
why
they
couldn't
move
into
that
area.
there
is
no
reason
why
they
couldn't
move
into
driving
at
a
terrible
highway
facility
record
in
this
country.
and
there
is
no
reason
--
we
have
got
a
terrible
alcoholic
problems
in
this
country.
there
is
no
reason
why
they
couldn't
move
into
the
alcoholic
and
the
drinking
area.
and
there
is
no
end
to
it
and
once
you
open
this
door,
if
you,
by
the
premise
that's
presented
here
by
the
solicitor
general
and
the
government
then
the
door
is
open.
it
also
it
seems
to
me
in
regard
to
this
and
this
is
the
last
comment
i
would
like
to
make
in
regard
to
the
katzenbach
case,
it
seems
to
me
that
when
congress
made
the
finding
they
did
that
there
was
an
invidious
discrimination
because
the
states
did
not
allow
18-year
old
persons
to
vote,
that
the
legislature
was
in
effect
invading
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
which
is
invested
in
this
court.
now
somebody
said,
that
--
and
i
think
it
was
the
solicitor
general
that
it
was
easier
for
congress
to
make
up
it's
mind
about
what
was
an
invidious
discrimination
in
this
area
than
it
was
to
the
nine
men
on
this
court.
i
don't
believe
that
for
one
minute
because
they
are
not
any
farther
away
from
the
people
in
idaho
or
arizona
or
california
or
maine
or
new
jersey
than
you
are
and
they
are
not
any
closer.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it's
a
judicial
determination
to
shape
the
size
of
what
is
discriminatory
to
lay
down
the
guideline,
not
a
legislative
one.
it
has
to
be
determined
on
facts
and
it
has
to
be
determined
in
a
specific
law
in
a
specific
instance.
as
applied
to
some
kind
of
standard
and
what
we
are
here
to
find
out
is,
are
you
going
to
let
the
legislature,
the
congress
of
the
united
states
set
the
standard
or
is
this
court
going
to
set
standard?
now
i
get
down
to
the
arguments
of
the
solicitor
general
in
regard
to
the
terrible
discrimination
which
my
state
perpetrates
on
residents
of
the
state
of
idaho.
solicitor
says
that,
under
the
act,
as
enacted
by
congress
that
we
must
allow
all
citizens
to
vote
whether
he
is
domiciled
in
the
state
or
not
on
the
same
basis
as
those
who
are
domiciled
within
the
state.
obviously,
this
is
an
impossibility.
you
have
to
have
different
procedures
for
those
residents
of
the
state
of
idaho
who
are
not
domiciled
in
the
state
and
who
register
and
vote
by
absentee
ballot
then
you
do
those
who
are
going
to
be
able
to
register
with
a
registrar
of
elections
and
go
to
the
polls
and
vote.
because
in
the
first
place,
gentleman,
you
have
to
use
a
little
federal
help
here,
you
have
to
use
the
united
states
post
office.
and
in
idaho,
we
get
one
mail
delivery
a
day
and
i
don't
know
how
you
do
in
the
rest
of
the
country,
but
out
there
we
get
one.
now
he
was
yelling
about
having
to
get
the
absentee
ballot
in
on
noon
of
the
election
day.
i
want
to
tell
you
what
the
problem
is.
i
was
prosecuting
attorney
in
idaho
county,
idaho
which
has
8700
square
miles,
that's
about
one-and-a-half
times
the
size
of
the
state
of
massachusetts
and
in
that
county,
there
are
12000
people
and
there
are
27
voting
precincts
and
when
the
mayor
comes
in
at
10
o'clock
in
the
morning
and
he
goes
to
the
county
clerk,
the
deputy
sheriffs
have
to
get
on
their
horse
or
their
car
or
whatever
it
maybe
and
get
to
those
precincts
and
get
those
absentee
ballots
there,
so
that
by
8
o'clock
at
night
when
the
polls
close,
they
will
be
there,
so
the
election
judges
can
count
them
and
if
you
think,
you
can
do
that
before
4
o'clock
in
the
morning
on
election
day,
you
are
out
of
your
mind
in
that
county.
it
can't
be
done,
it's
totally
impossible
and
gentleman
there
is
a
compelling
reason
for
having
those
votes
in
at
noon,
don't
let
anybody
kid
you.
there
are
13
towns
in
my
state
that
have
more
than
5000
people
in
them.
we
have
got
700,000
people
scattered
over
an
area,
they
would
make
most
of
you
ashamed,
two-and-a-half
people
per
square
mile
and
if
you
don't
think
that
doesn't
create
some
problems
administratively,
which
he
shrugs
off,
that's
great.
but
i
think,
it
creates
some
real
problems.
some
real
expenses
and
some
pragmatic
issues
that
the
state
of
idaho
is
interested
in
and
quite
frankly
with
all
due
respect,
i
don't
think
the
congress,
the
unites
states
has
got
any
business
monkeying
with
it
because
they
don't
know
what
they
are
talking
about.
mr.
robert
m.
robson
well,
i
know
--
mr.
robert
m.
robson
i
am
not
so
sure
they
did
and
i
don't
have
any
control
of
it,
your
honor.
i
have
very
little
influence
with
any
of
those.
mr.
robert
m.
robson
what?
mr.
robert
m.
robson
i
haven't
the
slightest
idea.
i
think
one
senator
did
and
i
think
the
other
three
did
not,
but
i
am
not
--
don't
quote
me.
he
says
that
--
he
says
really
as
he
thinks
to
have
the
congress
come
along
and
say,
“well
you
are
citizen
of
the
united
states,
you
just
vote
for
whoever
you
happen
to
light
on
election
day.”
we
have
a
reasonable
provision
in
the
idaho
law.
we
have
a
60-day
resident
requirement
for
the
president
and
vice-president,
i
don't
see
anything
unreasonable
about
it.
we
were
talking
about
fixing
a
line
here
earlier
this
morning,
between
18
and
21,
three
years,
30
days.
though
it
seems
to
me
that
the
whole
premise,
that
a
presidential
election
is
a
federal
event
is
a
false
premise,
if
you
have
ever
watched
tv
on
election
night,
what
you
see
is
how
the
states
are
voting
and
you
see
these
totals
come
up
on
the
board
and
everybody
is
waiting
for
precincts,
so
and
so
downstate,
in
the
lower
illinois
to
get
in,
there
are
seven
precincts
from
upper
michigan
to
get
in,
so
we
will
know
what
the
final
vote
is
and
it's
important
to
the
people
of
the
state
to
know
within
a
reasonable
time
what
their
vote
is
and
who
their
presidential
electors
are
and
really
it
doesn't
become
a
federal
job
until
they
meet
as
they
electoral
college
and
then
it
becomes
a
federal
event
because
up
to
that
time
who
is
supervising
the
election,
not
federal
officers,
who
is
paying
for
it,
there
isn't
any
federal
money
in
there.
and
when
they
passed
this
bill,
this
bill
to
amend
the
voting
rights
act,
i
didn't
see
him
appropriating
any
money
either
to
cover
any
increased
costs
or
expenses
it
might
cause
the
states.
and
to
me
that's
important
because
my
state
has
a
very
low
income.
now
let's
talk
about
fraud
for
a
minute.
we
have
--
we
are
close
to
a
lot
of
states
and
we
are
locked
in
the
mountains.
now
he
says
that
if
these
people
can
come
into
idaho
and
vote
in
an
election,
absentee,
if
they
left
idaho
30
days
ago
and
they
couldn't
get
in
the
next
stage
or
15
days
ago
and
they
couldn't
get
to
vote
on
next
stage,
so
we
got
to
take
them
and
they
are
right
back
on
and
they
say,
we
want
to
vote
by
absentee
ballot.
how
are
we
going
to
check
to
find
out
whether
they
really
did
not
vote
in
say
oklahoma
or
north
dakota?
most
of
our
coops
go
to
california,
so
california.
how
--
how
are
we
going
to
check
and
how
our
people
are
going
to
find
out
whether
there
is
a
vote
tried?
where
is
the
federal
register
that
we
are
going
to
find
out
whether
these
people
really
did
it
or
not?
don't
you
think
there
is
some
kind
of
compelling
interest
here
on
the
part
of
the
state
that
has
the
counter
ballot
to
find
out
whether
that
man
has
voted
twice
or
three
times
or
four
times?
he
shrugs
in
our
office
and
as
you
think,
i
have
been
a
prosecuting
attorney
both
at
the
federal
and
county
level,
i
know
it's
not
easy,
it's
tough.
it's
hard
to
get
the
evidence.
this
opens
it
wide
open
and
it's
awfully
hard
for
me
to
accept
a
legal
theory
which
says
that
once
a
man
has
decided
he
isn't
going
to
live
in
my
state
anymore
and
he
sells
his
property,
he
takes
his
kids
out
of
school
and
he
takes
his
wife,
and
he
leaves,
to
go
live
some
place
else.
how
can
it
be?
once
he
has
severed
his
residency
which
is
a
matter
of
objective
with
intent
and
that's
a
fundamental
principle
of
law,
once
he
has
objectively
said,
“i
no
longer
am
a
resident
of
the
state
of
idaho”
how
in
the
world
can
we
discriminate
against
the
man
that
isn't
even
in
our
jurisdiction,
i
want
to
know.
i
can't
see
how
in
the
world
we
can
be
held
responsible
for
that?
i
could
see
it,
if
congress
passed
a
law
saying,
in
the
federal
building,
ed
boyce,
idaho,
if
you
ever
happened
to
passing
through
idaho,
you
can
go
over
there
and
vote
and
register
and
we
will
count
them
and
we
will
see
that
it
gets
in
the
proper
place
and
that
it
gets
on
election
ballot.
but
i
cannot
see
for
the
like
of
me
how
that
kind
of
argument
can
be
used
successfully.
there
is
one
final
argument
i
would
like
to
make
in
this,
it
seems
to
me
this
argument
hasn't
been
made
at
all
today,
and
no
consideration
has
been
given
to
it.
there
seems
to
be
a
philosophy
or
a
tendency
on
the
part
of
not
only
court's,
but
congress
and
legislators
and
lawmakers
of
all
kinds
to
protect
the
individual
which
is
a
(inaudible)
he
is
totally
dependent
upon
us
to
protecting
him
from
everything.
now,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
so
greater
burden
that
a
man
ought
to
be
able
to
get
if
he
is
going
to
leave
a
state,
get
down
to
the
county
courthouse
and
get
his
absentee
ballot
and
vote
it
before
he
goes
to
timbuktu
or
he
goes
to
playground,
usa
or
he
flies
to
europe
or
if
he
comes
back
here
to
washington.
it
doesn't
take
very
long.
i
have
a
son,
who
is
going
to
school
in
state
of
oregon.
he
came
home
to
visit
this
summer
and
in
half
an
hour,
i
had
him
registered
and
voted
before
he
went
back
to
school
and
his
wife
too.
half
an
hour,
it
didn't
take
any
great
effort
to
protect
that
boy's
right
to
vote
and
his
wife's
right
to
vote.
with
a
little
planning,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
individual
could
pretty
well
protect
himself
and
if
he
wants
to
take
the
responsibility
for
lollygag
in
all
over
the
united
states
of
america
or
all
over
the
world
for
that
matter
and
he
doesn't
want
to
make
any
effort
to
get
where
he
is
supposed
to
be
when
it
comes
voting
time,
i
can't
feel
very
sorry
for
him.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
should
be
at
least
an
area
in
here
where
a
state
has
not
invidiously
discriminated
against
an
absentee
voter
because
this
30
lousy
days.
we
amended
our
constitution
some
time
ago
to
fall
in
line
with
the
trend
it
was
going
on
and
at
that
time
60
days
seemed
to
be
a
reasonable
period
of
time.
most
of
the
states
since
that
he
was
speaking
about
this
morning,
have
amended
their
laws
of
constitution
since
we
did.
and
we
keep
planning
ourselves
in
the
position
or
trying
to
call
off
at
the
times
and
then
finding
all
of
a
sudden,
we
didn't
go
far
enough
because
somebody
set
the
standard
in
other
notch.
we
find
this
particularly
true
all
along
in
the
line
of
administrative
law.
this
morning
we
argued
cipriano
and
kramer
and
i
have
a
great
deal
of
respect
for
this
court
in
those
decisions,
where
they
have
left
an
impact
on
my
state
and
the
city
of
phoenix
that
is
hard
to
imagine
because
for
two
years,
we
have
had
no
capital
investment
in
our
state
because
we
can't
sell
our
bonds
and
there
is
not
a
thing
i
can
do
about
it,
until
our
own
supreme
court
falls
in
line
with
this
court
and
if
it
doesn't
do
it
pretty
quick,
we
are
two
years
away
again
because
our
legislature
won't
be
able
to
take
care
of
the
problem.
so
when
these
ripples
come
out
from
here,
they
go
in
all
directions
and
they
are
very
important
and
it
seems
to
me
gentleman
that
congress
should
not
be
allowed
to
substitute
its
judgment
unless
there
is
a
serious,
capricious
and
arbitrary
judgment
being
made
by
the
state
legislature
and
i
don't
think
this
court
had
allowed
congress
under
the
provisions
of
section
1
and
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
rewrite
the
constitutions
and
statutes
of
50
states.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
m.
robson
mr.
chief
justice,
gentlemen
of
the
court.
i
hate
to
keep
flogging
this,
(inaudible)
to
death,
but
it
looks
like
that
is
the
name
of
the
game
all
afternoon.
i
think
that
we
have
heard
enough
arguments
that
i
can
assume
that
this
court
will
recognize
that
congress
at
least
directly
by
the
constitution
of
united
states
has
no
right
to
enfranchise
any
citizen
to
vote
per
se.
that
congress
can
legislatively,
to
prevent
discrimination
under
the
equal
protection
clause
is
not
denied.
the
combination
of
the
article
xiv,
section
1
and
section
5
certainly
has
be
and
allowed
to
be
exercised
by
this
court
in
a
good
many
areas,
but
i
think
when
you
look
at
the
section
14
as
a
whole,
you'll
find
that
really
the
intent
of
the
enactors
of
that
piece
of
legislation
were
attempting
to
stop
discrimination
against
citizens
of
the
united
states
in
an
area
where
discrimination
had
been
practiced
for
a
100
years
because
of
race,
color,
and
national
origin.
they
were
so
unsure
about
section
14
and
what
it
did
that
they
enacted
section
15
to
make
sure
that
they
weren't
understood,
that
they
weren't
misunderstood.
i
think
katzenbach
and
i
want
to
point
this
out
because
i
do
not
think
it
has
been
pointed
out
in
any
argument
today,
note
14
shows
that
expressly
in
the
constitutional
convention
of
state
of
new
york
there
was
a
great
deal
of
discussion
about
national
origin.
i
cannot
help
but
believe
that
this
court
has
taken
a
real
good
look
at
that
when
they
decided
katzenbach.
contrary
to
the
argument
of
the
solicitor
general,
i
do
think
that
there
was
in
this
court's
mind
invidious
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race,
color,
creed
or
national
origin.
mr.
robert
m.
robson
i
am
talking
about
katzenbach
versus
morgan,
the
case.
mr.
robert
m.
robson
i
was
talking
about
katzenbach
--
now,
you
got
me
confused,
i
might
not
on
your
wavelength.
mr.
robert
m.
robson
i
understand
that,
but
the
new
york
constitution
provision
that
was
struck
down
in
katzenbach
as
i
understand
and
in
one
of
the
footnotes,
in
that
case,
it
was
clearly
pointed
out.
i
think
it
is
on
page
645
or
654,
654
to
be
exact,
384
u.s.
654.
i
think
that
that
footnote
indicates
that
this
was
being
lifted
because
there
is
the
quote
in
there
directly
out
to
constitutional
convention
of
the
state
in
new
york
that
showed
that
they
were
considering
national
origin
as
the
source
for
their
limitation.
i
just
want
to
point
that
out
that
this
was
--
it
was
before
this
court,
it
does
have
some
overtones.
another
thing
that
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court,
and
there
has
been
some
discussion,
at
least
today
but
not
specifically
--
a
specific
--
there
was
this
specific
finding
by
congress
in
the
determination
of
how
they
were
going
to
word
this
section
in
regard
to
the
18-year
old
vote
in
which
they
found
in
exactly
the
language
of
this
court
in
katzenbach,
that
it
was
an
invidious
discrimination
for
the
states
not
to
allow
18
years
of
age
to
vote
because
of
their
military
service
as
required
by
them
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
this
is
i
think
a
syllogism
because
certainly
more
than
half
of
the
18
years
olds
in
this
country
are
women
that
are
not
subject
to
any
federal
service.
the
service
is
required
by
a
federal
act
not
by
a
state
act,
so
there
can't
be
any
state
discrimination
here
and
the
fact
that
of
the
50%
of
the
males
were
all
subject
to
military
service,
only
about
10%
of
them
ever,
ever
served
unless
we
were
in
a
world
war
ii
situation.
i
don't
believe
that
just
because
you
are
old
enough
to
fight,
means
that
you
are
old
enough
necessarily
to
vote.
all
that
means
is
you
are
old
enough
to
take
orders
and
you
have
been
old
enough
to
do
that
since
you
could
understand.
the
other
side
of
the
coin
is
that
if
you
are
too
old
to
fight,
as
i
am
now
considered
to
be
by
my
country
then
you
are
too
old
to
vote
and
i
do
not
think
i
am
too
old
to
vote.
i
would
like
to
point
out
another
argument
that
i
would
like
to
make.
the
rationale
of
the
arguments
that
have
proposed
here
by
the
solicitor
general
are
that
by
a
combination
of
sections
1
and
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
congress
can
do
something
indirectly
which
it
can't
find
in
the
enumeration
of
powers
that
it
may
do
directly.
in
other
words,
by
removing
at
a
step,
by
coming
on
with
an
argument
that
because
we
want
to
enforce
equal
protection
in
the
laws
and
we
don't
want
any
discrimination,
we
can
come
in
the
back
door
and
do
what
we
could
not
do
directly.
i
think
it's
a
parody
on
the
law
and
i
don't
think
it's
an
argument
that
holds
too
much
water,
particularly
in
a
situation
where
there
is
no
particular
discrimination
by
a
state
that
is
really
pervasive
across
the
board,
where
you
can
show
that
any
particular
age
group
or
section
of
the
population
is
really
being
discriminated
anymore
than
another.
here
is
a
group
between
18
and
21
that
are
not
allowed
to
vote.
well,
after
all
at
common
law
and
this
is
our
heritage,
nobody
was
allowed
to
vote
and
nobody
--
and
everybody
was
an
infant
till
they
were
21
years
of
age.
we
have
modified
this
up
and
down,
hither
and
yon
and
we
have
allowed
the
state
legislatures
to
do
this.
but
certainly
up
to
this
point
congress
has
never
attempted
to
do
so.
if
they
can
do
it
in
this
area,
in
the
area
of
the
political
arena,
then
there
is
no
reason
why
the
same
kind
of
argument
cannot
be
carried
over
into
marriage.
we
have
one
of
the
--
we
have
a
terrible
social
problem
with
the
break
up
of
marriage
in
this
country.
there
is
no
reason
why
they
couldn't
move
into
that
area.
there
is
no
reason
why
they
couldn't
move
into
driving
at
a
terrible
highway
facility
record
in
this
country.
and
there
is
no
reason
--
we
have
got
a
terrible
alcoholic
problems
in
this
country.
there
is
no
reason
why
they
couldn't
move
into
the
alcoholic
and
the
drinking
area.
and
there
is
no
end
to
it
and
once
you
open
this
door,
if
you,
by
the
premise
that's
presented
here
by
the
solicitor
general
and
the
government
then
the
door
is
open.
it
also
it
seems
to
me
in
regard
to
this
and
this
is
the
last
comment
i
would
like
to
make
in
regard
to
the
katzenbach
case,
it
seems
to
me
that
when
congress
made
the
finding
they
did
that
there
was
an
invidious
discrimination
because
the
states
did
not
allow
18-year
old
persons
to
vote,
that
the
legislature
was
in
effect
invading
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
which
is
invested
in
this
court.
now
somebody
said,
that
--
and
i
think
it
was
the
solicitor
general
that
it
was
easier
for
congress
to
make
up
it's
mind
about
what
was
an
invidious
discrimination
in
this
area
than
it
was
to
the
nine
men
on
this
court.
i
don't
believe
that
for
one
minute
because
they
are
not
any
farther
away
from
the
people
in
idaho
or
arizona
or
california
or
maine
or
new
jersey
than
you
are
and
they
are
not
any
closer.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it's
a
judicial
determination
to
shape
the
size
of
what
is
discriminatory
to
lay
down
the
guideline,
not
a
legislative
one.
it
has
to
be
determined
on
facts
and
it
has
to
be
determined
in
a
specific
law
in
a
specific
instance.
as
applied
to
some
kind
of
standard
and
what
we
are
here
to
find
out
is,
are
you
going
to
let
the
legislature,
the
congress
of
the
united
states
set
the
standard
or
is
this
court
going
to
set
standard?
now
i
get
down
to
the
arguments
of
the
solicitor
general
in
regard
to
the
terrible
discrimination
which
my
state
perpetrates
on
residents
of
the
state
of
idaho.
solicitor
says
that,
under
the
act,
as
enacted
by
congress
that
we
must
allow
all
citizens
to
vote
whether
he
is
domiciled
in
the
state
or
not
on
the
same
basis
as
those
who
are
domiciled
within
the
state.
obviously,
this
is
an
impossibility.
you
have
to
have
different
procedures
for
those
residents
of
the
state
of
idaho
who
are
not
domiciled
in
the
state
and
who
register
and
vote
by
absentee
ballot
then
you
do
those
who
are
going
to
be
able
to
register
with
a
registrar
of
elections
and
go
to
the
polls
and
vote.
because
in
the
first
place,
gentleman,
you
have
to
use
a
little
federal
help
here,
you
have
to
use
the
united
states
post
office.
and
in
idaho,
we
get
one
mail
delivery
a
day
and
i
don't
know
how
you
do
in
the
rest
of
the
country,
but
out
there
we
get
one.
now
he
was
yelling
about
having
to
get
the
absentee
ballot
in
on
noon
of
the
election
day.
i
want
to
tell
you
what
the
problem
is.
i
was
prosecuting
attorney
in
idaho
county,
idaho
which
has
8700
square
miles,
that's
about
one-and-a-half
times
the
size
of
the
state
of
massachusetts
and
in
that
county,
there
are
12000
people
and
there
are
27
voting
precincts
and
when
the
mayor
comes
in
at
10
o'clock
in
the
morning
and
he
goes
to
the
county
clerk,
the
deputy
sheriffs
have
to
get
on
their
horse
or
their
car
or
whatever
it
maybe
and
get
to
those
precincts
and
get
those
absentee
ballots
there,
so
that
by
8
o'clock
at
night
when
the
polls
close,
they
will
be
there,
so
the
election
judges
can
count
them
and
if
you
think,
you
can
do
that
before
4
o'clock
in
the
morning
on
election
day,
you
are
out
of
your
mind
in
that
county.
it
can't
be
done,
it's
totally
impossible
and
gentleman
there
is
a
compelling
reason
for
having
those
votes
in
at
noon,
don't
let
anybody
kid
you.
there
are
13
towns
in
my
state
that
have
more
than
5000
people
in
them.
we
have
got
700,000
people
scattered
over
an
area,
they
would
make
most
of
you
ashamed,
two-and-a-half
people
per
square
mile
and
if
you
don't
think
that
doesn't
create
some
problems
administratively,
which
he
shrugs
off,
that's
great.
but
i
think,
it
creates
some
real
problems.
some
real
expenses
and
some
pragmatic
issues
that
the
state
of
idaho
is
interested
in
and
quite
frankly
with
all
due
respect,
i
don't
think
the
congress,
the
unites
states
has
got
any
business
monkeying
with
it
because
they
don't
know
what
they
are
talking
about.
mr.
robert
m.
robson
well,
i
know
--
mr.
robert
m.
robson
i
am
not
so
sure
they
did
and
i
don't
have
any
control
of
it,
your
honor.
i
have
very
little
influence
with
any
of
those.
mr.
robert
m.
robson
what?
mr.
robert
m.
robson
i
haven't
the
slightest
idea.
i
think
one
senator
did
and
i
think
the
other
three
did
not,
but
i
am
not
--
don't
quote
me.
he
says
that
--
he
says
really
as
he
thinks
to
have
the
congress
come
along
and
say,
“well
you
are
citizen
of
the
united
states,
you
just
vote
for
whoever
you
happen
to
light
on
election
day.”
we
have
a
reasonable
provision
in
the
idaho
law.
we
have
a
60-day
resident
requirement
for
the
president
and
vice-president,
i
don't
see
anything
unreasonable
about
it.
we
were
talking
about
fixing
a
line
here
earlier
this
morning,
between
18
and
21,
three
years,
30
days.
though
it
seems
to
me
that
the
whole
premise,
that
a
presidential
election
is
a
federal
event
is
a
false
premise,
if
you
have
ever
watched
tv
on
election
night,
what
you
see
is
how
the
states
are
voting
and
you
see
these
totals
come
up
on
the
board
and
everybody
is
waiting
for
precincts,
so
and
so
downstate,
in
the
lower
illinois
to
get
in,
there
are
seven
precincts
from
upper
michigan
to
get
in,
so
we
will
know
what
the
final
vote
is
and
it's
important
to
the
people
of
the
state
to
know
within
a
reasonable
time
what
their
vote
is
and
who
their
presidential
electors
are
and
really
it
doesn't
become
a
federal
job
until
they
meet
as
they
electoral
college
and
then
it
becomes
a
federal
event
because
up
to
that
time
who
is
supervising
the
election,
not
federal
officers,
who
is
paying
for
it,
there
isn't
any
federal
money
in
there.
and
when
they
passed
this
bill,
this
bill
to
amend
the
voting
rights
act,
i
didn't
see
him
appropriating
any
money
either
to
cover
any
increased
costs
or
expenses
it
might
cause
the
states.
and
to
me
that's
important
because
my
state
has
a
very
low
income.
now
let's
talk
about
fraud
for
a
minute.
we
have
--
we
are
close
to
a
lot
of
states
and
we
are
locked
in
the
mountains.
now
he
says
that
if
these
people
can
come
into
idaho
and
vote
in
an
election,
absentee,
if
they
left
idaho
30
days
ago
and
they
couldn't
get
in
the
next
stage
or
15
days
ago
and
they
couldn't
get
to
vote
on
next
stage,
so
we
got
to
take
them
and
they
are
right
back
on
and
they
say,
we
want
to
vote
by
absentee
ballot.
how
are
we
going
to
check
to
find
out
whether
they
really
did
not
vote
in
say
oklahoma
or
north
dakota?
most
of
our
coops
go
to
california,
so
california.
how
--
how
are
we
going
to
check
and
how
our
people
are
going
to
find
out
whether
there
is
a
vote
tried?
where
is
the
federal
register
that
we
are
going
to
find
out
whether
these
people
really
did
it
or
not?
don't
you
think
there
is
some
kind
of
compelling
interest
here
on
the
part
of
the
state
that
has
the
counter
ballot
to
find
out
whether
that
man
has
voted
twice
or
three
times
or
four
times?
he
shrugs
in
our
office
and
as
you
think,
i
have
been
a
prosecuting
attorney
both
at
the
federal
and
county
level,
i
know
it's
not
easy,
it's
tough.
it's
hard
to
get
the
evidence.
this
opens
it
wide
open
and
it's
awfully
hard
for
me
to
accept
a
legal
theory
which
says
that
once
a
man
has
decided
he
isn't
going
to
live
in
my
state
anymore
and
he
sells
his
property,
he
takes
his
kids
out
of
school
and
he
takes
his
wife,
and
he
leaves,
to
go
live
some
place
else.
how
can
it
be?
once
he
has
severed
his
residency
which
is
a
matter
of
objective
with
intent
and
that's
a
fundamental
principle
of
law,
once
he
has
objectively
said,
“i
no
longer
am
a
resident
of
the
state
of
idaho”
how
in
the
world
can
we
discriminate
against
the
man
that
isn't
even
in
our
jurisdiction,
i
want
to
know.
i
can't
see
how
in
the
world
we
can
be
held
responsible
for
that?
i
could
see
it,
if
congress
passed
a
law
saying,
in
the
federal
building,
ed
boyce,
idaho,
if
you
ever
happened
to
passing
through
idaho,
you
can
go
over
there
and
vote
and
register
and
we
will
count
them
and
we
will
see
that
it
gets
in
the
proper
place
and
that
it
gets
on
election
ballot.
but
i
cannot
see
for
the
like
of
me
how
that
kind
of
argument
can
be
used
successfully.
there
is
one
final
argument
i
would
like
to
make
in
this,
it
seems
to
me
this
argument
hasn't
been
made
at
all
today,
and
no
consideration
has
been
given
to
it.
there
seems
to
be
a
philosophy
or
a
tendency
on
the
part
of
not
only
court's,
but
congress
and
legislators
and
lawmakers
of
all
kinds
to
protect
the
individual
which
is
a
(inaudible)
he
is
totally
dependent
upon
us
to
protecting
him
from
everything.
now,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
so
greater
burden
that
a
man
ought
to
be
able
to
get
if
he
is
going
to
leave
a
state,
get
down
to
the
county
courthouse
and
get
his
absentee
ballot
and
vote
it
before
he
goes
to
timbuktu
or
he
goes
to
playground,
usa
or
he
flies
to
europe
or
if
he
comes
back
here
to
washington.
it
doesn't
take
very
long.
i
have
a
son,
who
is
going
to
school
in
state
of
oregon.
he
came
home
to
visit
this
summer
and
in
half
an
hour,
i
had
him
registered
and
voted
before
he
went
back
to
school
and
his
wife
too.
half
an
hour,
it
didn't
take
any
great
effort
to
protect
that
boy's
right
to
vote
and
his
wife's
right
to
vote.
with
a
little
planning,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
individual
could
pretty
well
protect
himself
and
if
he
wants
to
take
the
responsibility
for
lollygag
in
all
over
the
united
states
of
america
or
all
over
the
world
for
that
matter
and
he
doesn't
want
to
make
any
effort
to
get
where
he
is
supposed
to
be
when
it
comes
voting
time,
i
can't
feel
very
sorry
for
him.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
should
be
at
least
an
area
in
here
where
a
state
has
not
invidiously
discriminated
against
an
absentee
voter
because
this
30
lousy
days.
we
amended
our
constitution
some
time
ago
to
fall
in
line
with
the
trend
it
was
going
on
and
at
that
time
60
days
seemed
to
be
a
reasonable
period
of
time.
most
of
the
states
since
that
he
was
speaking
about
this
morning,
have
amended
their
laws
of
constitution
since
we
did.
and
we
keep
planning
ourselves
in
the
position
or
trying
to
call
off
at
the
times
and
then
finding
all
of
a
sudden,
we
didn't
go
far
enough
because
somebody
set
the
standard
in
other
notch.
we
find
this
particularly
true
all
along
in
the
line
of
administrative
law.
this
morning
we
argued
cipriano
and
kramer
and
i
have
a
great
deal
of
respect
for
this
court
in
those
decisions,
where
they
have
left
an
impact
on
my
state
and
the
city
of
phoenix
that
is
hard
to
imagine
because
for
two
years,
we
have
had
no
capital
investment
in
our
state
because
we
can't
sell
our
bonds
and
there
is
not
a
thing
i
can
do
about
it,
until
our
own
supreme
court
falls
in
line
with
this
court
and
if
it
doesn't
do
it
pretty
quick,
we
are
two
years
away
again
because
our
legislature
won't
be
able
to
take
care
of
the
problem.
so
when
these
ripples
come
out
from
here,
they
go
in
all
directions
and
they
are
very
important
and
it
seems
to
me
gentleman
that
congress
should
not
be
allowed
to
substitute
its
judgment
unless
there
is
a
serious,
capricious
and
arbitrary
judgment
being
made
by
the
state
legislature
and
i
don't
think
this
court
had
allowed
congress
under
the
provisions
of
section
1
and
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
rewrite
the
constitutions
and
statutes
of
50
states.
thank
you.
