justice
byron
r.
white
professor
wright,
i
take
it
though
you
will
be
making
the
same
argument
if
the
section
2
were
not
in
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
let's
assume
it
is
there
and
say
that
the
state
had
the
voting
age
of
45
and
congress
had
come
along
and
said
all
people
who
are
21
may
vote,
you
would
still
make
the
same
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
congress
would
still
be
substituting
its
judgment
for
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
simply
say
that
the
courts
would
find
that
to
be
a
denial
of
equal
protection,
if
the
congress
took
it
simply
and
informed
the
courts
of
its
opinion?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
think
that
even
absent
section
2
that
this
legislation
the
congress
has
passed
is
beyond
its
power?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
quite
an
argument
can
be
made
that
18-year-olds
are
as
capable
as
21-year-olds
today?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
where
does
that
lead
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
if
reasonable
men
to
differ
about
--
between
18
and
21
and
congress
comes
along
and
says
18,
you
would
say
that's
inappropriate
legislation?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor
general,
suppose
last
the
last
term,
some
18-year
olds
that
challenged
the
21-year
old
requirements
in
some
states,
and
we
had
decided
that
the
21-year
old
residence
or
21-year
voting
requirement,
age
requirement,
did
not
violate
the
equal
protection
clause,
that
a
state
may
limit
the
vote
to
those
who
are
21.
then
congress
passes
this
law,
and
the
law
is
challenged,
and
we
--
may
we
or
must
we
under
katzenbach
say
that
--
could
we
say,
although
we
adhere
to
our
view
of
last
term
that
the
21-year
old
age
requirement
does
not
violate
the
equal
protection
clause,
we
nevertheless
sustain
this
act
of
congress?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
what
would
be
appropriate
then
in
the
congressional
legislation
in
that
respect?
is
this
just
a
assertion
by
congress
that
the
court
was
wrong?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
we
--
then
we
changing
our
mind
from
last
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
of
its
impact
on
a
state
commerce,
but
here
if
the
equal
protection
clause
doesn't
require
18-year
olds
to
be
given
the
vote,
how
--
what
could
be
--
how
could
you
perceive
a
basis
for
congressional
enforcement
of
something
that
the
equal
protection
clause
doesn't
require
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
was
it
sort
of
a
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
so
mr.
solicitor
general,
the
section
5
gives
congress
equal
power
to
exclude
as
well
as
to
include,
3.2
beer
--
justice
byron
r.
white
–-
3.2
beer
was
excluded,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
excluded
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
congress'
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
we
are
bound
to
accept
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
same
standard
for
exclusion
as
inclusion?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
would
suppose
there
might
be
some
limits,
but
how
about
the
standard
by
which
we
judge
the
validity
of
congressional
action
under
section
5.
the
same
for
exclusion
as
inclusion?
if
it
says
cough
syrup
is
within
the
reach
of
the
eighteenth
amendment,
if
it's
got
something
intoxicating
and
in
a
certain
amount
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
use
the
same
standard
in
your
view
to
judge
the
validity
of
congressional
act
which
excludes
from
coverage
as
well
as
includes?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you
again
mr.
solicitor
general?
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
arizona
itself
has
been
guilty
in
the
past
of
denials
of
equal
protection
to
certain
groups
other
than
denying
them
the
right
to
vote?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
with
respect
to
negroes?
justice
byron
r.
white
although
now
negroes
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
is
that
sustains
this
act
with
respect
to
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now
what
is
the
legal
justification
for
congress
making
arizona
remedy
the
--
make
them
to
do
something
that
they
otherwise
would
not
have
to
do
because
of
something
some
other
state
did?
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
even
literates
have
been
subjected
to
denial
the
protection
by
state
a
and
congress
you
say,
may
give
them
the
remedy
in
state
b?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
the
reason
is
some
other
state
in
the
past
has
denied
them
equal
protection?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
states
who
deprive
these
illiterates
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
law,
haven't
denied
them
equal
protection
law
and
they
have
moved
to
arizona,
arizona
could
maintain
literacy
test?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
the
impact
of
the
statute,
but
i
am
just
asking
about
the
justification
for
them
and
the
justification
is
that
although
arizona
could
have
maintained
this
literacy
test
in
normal
circumstances,
people
have
moved
there
from
other
places
who
have
been
denied
the
equal
protection
of
the
law?
