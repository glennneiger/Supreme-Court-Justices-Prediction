mr.
robert
b.
sobol
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
these
cases
are
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
oregon.
the
issue
is
similar
to
that
involved
in
the
preceding
case,
but
different
in
a
very
fundamental
respect.
the
--
each
of
these
three
criminal
convictions
were
tried
after
the
date
of
this
court's
decision
in
duncan
versus
louisiana,
and
under
the
holding
of
destefano
against
woods,
therefore,
the
cases
that
i
am
now
about
to
argue
are
governed
by
the
duncan
rule
by
which
this
court
held
that
sixth
amendment
right
to
trial
by
jury
by
virtue
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
applicable
to
the
state
criminal
proceedings.
as
a
result
of
that
holding,
the
primary
question
before
the
court
in
these
cases
is
whether
the
sixth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
secures
unanimity
in
jury
trials.
the
petitioners
in
each
of
the
--
each
of
the
three
petitioners
in
these
cases
were
convicted
of
a
serious
crime
by
less
than
a
unanimous
jury
in
the
state
of
oregon
in
accordance
with
the
procedures
set
forth
in
article
i,
section
11
of
the
oregon
constitution
which
permits
a
jury
to
render
a
verdict
of
guilty
other
than
murder
in
the
first
degree
by
10
out
of
12
votes
with
2
jurors
in
disagreement
before
the
sentence.
in
the
madden
case,
the
charge
was
grand
larceny.
the
record
shows
the
jury
was
out
less
than
30
minutes
and
rendered
a
verdict
of
guilty
by
11-1
and
madden
was
sentenced
to
3
years
in
prison.
in
the
apodaca
case,
the
charge
was
assault
with
a
deadly
weapon.
the
jury
was
out
for
41
minutes.
they
rendered
a
verdict
of
guilty
by
a
vote
of
11-1,
and
apodaca
was
sentenced
to
5
years
in
prison.
in
the
cooper
case,
the
charge
was
burglary
in
a
dwelling.
the
jury
was
out
for
51
minutes
and
rendered
a
verdict
by
a
vote
of
10-2,
and
cooper
was
sentenced
to
three-and-half
years
in
prison.
each
of
the
cases
was
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
oregon
which
followed
the
recent
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
which,
by
a
4-3
vote
in
state
began,
held
that
interpreting
duncan
that
the
rule
of
unanimity,
historic
rule
of
unanimity,
was
not
incorporated
by
the
sixth
amendment
and
was
not
applicable
to
the
states.
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
denied
review
in
these
cases
and
this
court
granted
certiorari.
in
williams
against
florida,
decided
last
term,
this
court
held
that
only
those
common
law
requisites
of
trial
by
jury
that
are
fundamental
in
their
purpose
that
are
essential
to
the
functioning
of
a
jury
as
an
institution
secured
by
the
sixth
amendment,
and
the
mere
fact
that
a
procedure
was
part
of
the
jury
requisites,
a
common
law
does
not
itself
satisfy
the
standard
for
inclusion
in
the
sixth
amendment
unless
there
is
a
showing
that
that
procedure
is
fundamental.
our
argument
here
is
plainly
within
the
holding
of
williams.
we
think
that
there
was,
as
the
court
said
in
williams,
there
was
no
showing
that
the
number
12
could
be
shown
to
have
served
any
special
or
significant
function.
we
think
there
are
several
reasons,
why
the
requirement
of
unanimity
serves
important
functions
for
the
jury,
and
it's
on
this
basis,
we
ask
the
court,
applying
to
williams
holding
to
hold
that
the
right
of
unanimity
was
incorporated
by
the
sixth
amendment
and
is
therefore,
applicable
to
the
trial
of
these
petitioners.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
i'm
not
making
the
argument,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
we
automatically
have
a
rule
of
unanimity
because
of
common
law
history.
i'm
accepting
the
test
articulated
by
the
court
in
williams,
and
that
is
that
it
is
not
bound
by
history
on
this
point,
that
both
the
common
law
history
and
the
constitutional
history
leave
the
question
open.
that's
what
this
court
said
and
that
the
issue,
therefore,
for
the
court
to
decide
in
each
instance
is
the
fundamental
nature
of
the
requisite
in
issue
--
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
on
the
standard
of
the
--
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
no,
the
constitution.
mr.
justice
white
said
for
the
court
in
williams
that,
in
each
case
in
which
there
is
a
question
of
whether
a
jury
requisite
is
incorporated
in
the
sixth
amendment,
as
part
of
the
sixth
amendment
guarantee,
it
will
look
to
the
historic
purposes
of
the
jury,
the
functioning
of
the
jury,
and
determine
and
interpreting
the
word
“jury”
in
the
sixth
amendment
which
is
what
--
the
text
we
looked
to,
what
that
word
“jury”
means.
it
certainly
means
something,
and
we
think
that
there
are
some
of
the
common
law
requisites
that
are
incorporated
by
the
use
of
the
word
“jury”
in
the
sixth
amendment
and
as
the
court
held
in
williams,
some
are
not.
and,
the
test
in
interpreting
the
word
“jury”
in
the
sixth
amendment
which
is
the
source,
that
the
test
is
the
fundamental
nature
of
the
essential
purposes
of
the
requisite
in
issue
in
terms
of
jury
trial.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
in
answer
to
that
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
just
take
the
holding
of
the
court
in
williams
that
the
history
of
an
effort
to
make
the
sixth
amendment
more
specific
by
including
the
word
“unanimity”
in
the
sixth
amendment
can
be
read
either
way.
it
can
be
read
to
be
interpreted,
as
mr.
justice
holland
said
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
williams,
that
it
was
so
much
assumed
that
the
requirement
of
unanimity
and
12
men
in
that
case
was
incorporated
by
the
use
of
the
word
“jury,”
there
was
no
necessity
for
particularization.
it
could
also
be
argued
that
that
was
not
assumed,
that
an
effort
was
made,
and
that
the
effort
failed
and
that
has
significance.
this
court's
interpretation
in
williams
of
that
history
said
the
question
is
open,
that
we
cannot
--
there
is
not
enough
guidance
either
way
from
the
history.
examining
that
very
process
of
mr.
madison's
proposed
amendment,
it's
consideration,
it's
passage
on
one
side,
it's
defeat
on
the
other,
and
it's
ultimate
defeat,
this
court
considering
that
history
said
the
question
is
open.
now,
we
look
to
fundamentalness.
i
approach
this
case
exactly
within
the
test
which
was
framed
by
the
court
in
williams,
and
i
would
like
to
argue
to
the
court
that
in
at
least
three
respects,
three
very
important
respects,
the
requirement
of
unanimity
serves
that
fundamental
function
that
the
court
was
talking
about
in
williams
when
it
said
we
are
going
to
only
incorporate
those
that
serve
a
fundamental
function.
and
the
functions
that
we
think
it
does
serve
that
are
fundamental
is
its
effect
on
the
process
of
deliberation,
its
effect
on
the
government's
burden
of
proof,
and
its
effect
on
the
constitutional
requirements,
that
a
cross-section
of
the
community
participate
in
jury
decisions.
i'd
like
to
briefly
take
those
up
--
each
one
up
without
repeating
unnecessarily
on
the
argument
in
the
case
that
preceded.
the
court
--
this
court
in
allen
against
united
states,
in
1896,
said
the
very
object
of
the
jury
system
is
to
secure
unanimity
by
a
comparison
of
views
and
by
arguments
among
the
jurors
themselves.
the
process
of
group
deliberation
by
jury
tests
the
juror's
understanding
of
the
evidence,
requires
dissenting
and
majority
views
in
order
to
reach
a
verdict
come
out
of
the
jury
room,
requires
them
to
put
their
impressions
of
the
evidence
to
a
test,
and
has
historically
been
recognized
as
a
very
important
safeguard
in
weeding
out
erroneous
or
misunderstandings
of
the
evidence.
the
requirement
of
unanimity,
wherever
there
is
any
dissenter
in
the
jury
room,
requires
that
the
jury
discuss
the
case
and
come
out
with
some
kind
of
consensus
upon
full
discussion
and
consideration
of
the
issues.
now,
the
majority
verdict
rule
undercuts
deliberation
in
two
respects.
when
the
first
vote
of
the
jury
shows
that
there
is
the
requisite
majority
for
a
verdict,
regardless
of
whether
there
any
dissenters,
there
is
no
deliberation
at
all
and
the
jury
comes
back
to
the
court
room
and
renders
its
verdict.
in
a
case
of
that
kind,
even
though
one
or
two
jurors
in
the
oregon
procedure
or
one,
two,
or
three
jurors
in
the
louisiana
procedure
have
objections
to
the
finding
of
guilt
feel
that
there
is
doubt
about
the
evidence,
there
is
no
opportunity
whatsoever
for
them
to
so
much
as
express
their
views
and
have
the
possibility
of
them
convincing
the
majority
of
the
correctness
of
their
views,
there's
no
deliberation
whatsoever.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
well,
we
don't
know
about
any
particular
jury
whether
it
does
or
it
does
not,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
but,
the
time
that
the
juries
in
these
cases
were
out
for
example,
which
in
all
cases
was
less
than
an
hour
and
in
one
case
was
less
than
half
an
hour,
is
very
strong
indication
of
that.
more
important
indication
of
that
is
the
fact
that,
again
going
back
to
kalven
&
zeisel,
which
seems
to
be
the
text
in
terms
of
jury
functioning
that
in
the
state
of
oregon
and
the
state
of
louisiana,
25%
of
jury
verdicts
are
split
verdicts,
whereas,
across
the
country,
only
5%
of
the
juries
hang.
so,
if
those
facts,
if
that
survey
is
accurate,
it
would
indicate
that
in
many,
many
cases,
five
times
as
often
as
a
jury
would
hang,
the
deliberative
process
is
short-circuited
by
the
fact
that
the
--
a
certain
number
of
jurors
are
entitled
to
render
a
verdict
under
the
constitutional
procedure
at
issue.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
possibly,
it
can
happen.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
i
mean
possibly
because
that
won't
often
happen,
because
he's
--
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
because
they're
instructed
by
the
court
to
engage
in
the
process
of
deliberation.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
well,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
cannot
guarantee
in
any
particular
case
that
the
fact
that
there
are
10
jurors
for
conviction
and
2
for
acquittal
in
a
jurisdiction
where
unanimity
is
required,
meaning
there
will
be
discussion,
but
in
95%
of
the
criminal
cases
tried
in
this
country,
there
is
a
judgment.
there
is
a
verdict.
only
5%
are
hung.
that,
plus
the
court's
instructions
to
the
jury
is
very
strong
indication,
i
would
think,
that
except
for
the
aberrational
situation,
when
the
jurors
take
their
first
ballot
and
find
themselves
in
disagreement
they
will
discuss
the
case.
i
can't
guarantee
that
that
would
happen.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
excuse
me,
i
didn't
hear.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
i
have
no
choice
at
this
point.
i
do
accept
a
six-man
jury.
i
--
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
the
issue
in
this
case
is
unanimity.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
in
this
case,
yes,
sir.
and
in
oregon,
as
it
happens,
the
jury
size
is
12
with
10
members
concurring
it.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
well
--
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
in
terms
of
what
ultimately
happens?
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
the
only
figures
i
have
seen
are
the
figures
in
kalven
&
zeisel
in
which
--
and
those
authors
say
that
it
is
rare
in
those
cases
for
the
jury
to
be
100%
turned
around,
and
if
the
vote
is
9-3,
a
10-2
conviction
come
out
for
acquittal.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
the
initial
split
in
the
hung
jury
cases,
the
evidence
seems
to
be,
is
closer
than
10-2
or
11-1.
it's
more
like
8-4
or
7-5
with
--
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
--
with
some
of
the
dissenting
jurors
changing
their
mind
--
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
and
some,
holding
their
own.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
it
depends
on
the
stage
you
get
it.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
if
you
get
it
after
two
--
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
yes,
sir.
if
you
get
it
after
two
days
of
deliberation,
the
chances
are
very
strong
that
the
jury
is
going
to
be
locked.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
when
it
starts
out,
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
8-7.[attempt
to
laughter]
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
it's
probably
going
to
stay
there,
but
the
procedures
that
are
at
issue
in
this
case
--
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
probably,
that's
all
that
the
court
can
say
based
on
the
evidence.
on
the
deliberation
point,
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that,
quantitatively,
the
most
important
function
of
this
majority
verdict
rule
is
not
to
avoid
hung
juries,
but
to
short-circuit
the
process
of
deliberation
because
as
i've
indicated,
25%
of
the
criminal
trials
in
these
jurisdictions
result
in
split
verdicts
in
situations
where
the
nationwide
evidence
is
very
strong
that
a
consensus
would
be
reached,
an
unanimous
jury
verdict
would
be
reached.
so
a
very
important
function,
a
very
important
product,
not
functions
in
the
sense
it's
intended,
but
a
very
important
product
of
the
rules
of
allowing
majority
verdicts
is
that
the
historic
deliberative
process
of
the
jury
is
short-circuited.
in
going
back
to
williams,
i
would
suggest
the
process
of
the
jury
deliberating
together,
exchanging
views,
considering
the
views
of
everybody
in
the
jury
room
is
one
of
the
fundamental
requisites
of
the
jury
system
which
we
--
i
would
argue,
under
williams,
is
incorporated.
now,
oregon
makes
a
peculiar
kind
of
answer
to
this
assertion.
it
points
to
the
english
statute
which
was
adopted
in
1967
which
establishes
a
minimum
period
of
deliberation
before
the
jury
verdict
by
a
10-1
or
11-1
vote
can
be
received
and
says,
“well,
there
are
other
ways
of
doing
it”
and,
my
answer
to
that
is
perhaps
there
are
other
ways
of
doing
it.
perhaps,
unanimity
is
not
the
only
way
of
assuring
deliberation.
i
happen
to
think
it's
the
best,
but
the
important
point
for
this
is
the
court
hasn't
got
that
before
it.
when
some
state,
some
american
state,
adopts
a
procedure
of
majority
verdicts
and
a
minimum
period
of
deliberation,
the
court
can
then
consider
the
question
whether
that
comports
with
the
constitutional
requirements,
whether
that's
sufficient
safeguard.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
excuse
me?
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
no,
sir,
not
in
criminal
cases.
no,
sir,
we
don't.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
in
civil
cases
which
is
a
different
amendment,
yes,
sir.
but,
the
court
has
not
had
the
question
and
certainly
doesn't
have
the
question
on
the
criminal
side
of
what
the
constitutional
implications
would
be
of
the
english
statute.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
certainly.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
yes,
sir,
and
that's
the
point
i'm
about
to
get
to
as
the
second
essential
fundamental
purpose
of
trial
by
a
unanimous
jury.
we
think
the
requirement
of
the
unanimity
is
closely
related
to
the
requirement
of
burden
--
to
the
burden
of
proof
imposed
on
the
government
in
a
criminal
case.
in
winship,
this
court
articulated
it
as
a
constitutional
matter
that
that
burden
of
proof
was
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
but
beyond
the
particular
articulation,
it
has
always
been
clear
that
there
is
a
very
high
burden
of
proof
on
the
government
in
criminal
cases
and
that
burden
of
proof
in
practice
means,
and
has
always
meant,
one
thing,
and
that
is
convincing
everybody
in
the
jury
room
of
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
it's
perfectly
clear,
as
the
preceding
argument
seem
to
acknowledge,
that
where
less
jurors
than
12
can
convict
or
less
jurors
than
all
can
convict,
it
is
easier
to
convict,
less
evidence
is
needed.
now,
i
don't
think
the
question
--
to
give
my
response
to
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
the
question
in
a
due
process
in
a
criminal
procedure
case
before
this
court
is
simply
whether
convictions
are
harder
or
easier,
obviously
not.
i
think
the
question
is
much
more
complicated
than
that,
but
in
this
case
there
are
two
points
that
distinguish
that.
one
is
that
you
have
an
historic
system
for
the
functioning
of
the
reasonable
doubt
standard.
reasonable
doubt
means
you
convince
everybody
in
the
jury
room
of
something.
when
you
tinker
with
that
standard,
when
you
say
two-thirds
will
do
or
three-quarters
will
do
or
five
or
six
will
do,
you
are
lowering
the
government's
burden
of
proof.
you
are
altering
whatever
“guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt”
has
always
meant.
it's
being
altered
in
these
cases
and
less
proof
will
do.
now,
the
second
thing
which
i
think,
which
i
think
is
a
very
important
aspect
of
this,
is
that
this
is
not
a
case
where
we're
saying
a
particular
procedural
rule
will
alter
the
rate
of
convictions
in
the
sense
of
their
exclusion
of
confessions
or
exclusion
of
illegally
seized
evidence
where
the
countervailing
factor
is
not
the
correctness
of
the
fact-finding
but
police
conduct
or
administrative
conduct
where
other
factors
are
being
weighed
against
the
probable
outcome
of
a
criminal
trial.
here,
the
alteration
before
the
court
affects
the
integrity
of
the
fact-finding
process.
as
the
opinions
of
a
court
in
winship
recognized,
whenever
there
is
an
ex
post
facto
determination
of
facts,
whenever
some
later
body
is
determining
what
happened,
there's
always
a
chance
of
error.
the
tradition
of
this
country
is
that
chance
of
error
is
reduced
to
what
is
considered
an
acceptable
point
by
requiring
every
juror
to
concur
in
the
determination
of
the
jury.
when
less
jurors
have
to
concur,
obviously,
there
is
an
increase
risk
of
error,
and
that's
what's
before
the
court,
a
procedure
which
allows
a
lessening
of
the
historic
protection
against
an
erroneous
conviction,
the
conviction
of
an
innocent
man.
now
--
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
yes,
that's
true,
and
i'm
certain
that
happens,
but
the
--
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
well,
i
think
i
can
for
this
reason.
the
kalven
and
zeisel
study,
again,
shows
--
had
found
that
it
is
a
very
unusual
case
where
a
jury
which
has
split
11-1
or
10-2
at
the
outset
will
eventually
hang.
the
notion
of
a
stubborn
juror
is
one
that
the
examination
of
criminal
trials
does
not
seem
to
support,
rather,
their
finding
is
that
when
a
jury
will
ultimately
hang
by
an
11-1
or
10-2
vote,
that
jury
is
one
which
was
much
more
closely
divided
at
the
outset
and
was
divided
in
response
to
very
substantial
difficulties
in
the
government's
case.
and
while
the
give
and
take
of
the
process
of
deliberation
had
its
inevitable
effect
on
some
of
the
dissenters,
that
where
one
or
two
are
left,
they
are
the
representatives
of
the
remnants
of
a
much
larger
body
of
initial
dissenters,
which
would
indicate
that
it's
not
just
an
aberration
of
one
or
two
jurors
at
the
outset
flouting
the
opinion
of
a
much
larger
group,
but
that
it's
a
process
which
evolves
from
a
very
substantial
minority
at
the
outset.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
that
is
true,
but
if
it's
a
two-way
street,
it's
a
very
steep
hill
because
the
figures
indicate
that
where
juries
are
deadlocked
11-1
and
10-2,
in
over
80%
of
those
cases,
they're
voting
for
conviction.
that
it's
something
in
the
neighborhood
of
18%
of
juries
that
are
split
by
those
votes
at
favor
acquittal.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
at
the
ultimate
deadlock,
so
what
i'm
--
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
yes,
sir,
that's
true.
but,
when
that
point
is
reached
in
oregon
is
when
the
verdict
is
allowed.
if
there
was
a
greater
division
in
the
first
place,
they
were
not,
by
virtue
of
a
constitutional
provision,
requiring
10
votes
--
allowed
to
come
in.
the
difference
between
the
oregon
procedure
and
the
procedure
in
the
other
states
is
that,
at
that
point,
a
verdict
can
be
--
the
jury
is
not
hung
when
it's
10-2
or
11-1,
but
a
verdict
can
be
rendered.
what
i'm
trying
to
indicate
is
that,
in
those
situations,
over
80%
of
those
cases
are
convictions.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
this
is,
again,
sir,
is
kalven
&
zeisel.
secondly,
i
would
--
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
yes,
sir.
there's
a
constitutional
right
to
unanimity,
which
means
the
constitutional
right
to
having
a
hung
jury.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
yes,
sir.
i
don't
know
that
you
have
a
right
to
be
retried,
but
yes,
if
the
prosecutor
wants
to
retry
--
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
correct.
right.[attempt
to
laughter]
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
no,
sir.
i
have
to
go
on
the
process
of
deliberation.
i
have
to
go
on
what's
the
function
--
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
well,
it's
a
process,
mr.
justice
marshall.
the
sixth
amendment
says
right
to
trial
by
jury.
this
court
in
williams
said
that
means
those
fundamental
requisites
--
those
requisites
that
can
be
shown
fundamental
are
in
that
word,
in
that
word
“jury.”
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
i
think
it
does
include
it.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
excuse
me?
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
williams
leaves
the
question.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
reserved
the
question
in
williams.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
yes,
sir.
i'm
not
arguing
anything
else.
it
was
reserved.
it
was
not
decided
by
williams,
but
the
test
articulated
by
the
court
in
williams,
i
think
resolves
this
case
in
my
favor
because
i
think
that
we
can
show,
and
have
shown,
that
there
is
a
fundamental
purpose.
it's
not
mystical
or
arbitrary
quality
of
trial
by
jury
the
way
12
was
found
to
be,
but
has
a
fundamental
purpose.
if
i
may
go
back
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question,
i
think
there's
one
other
answer
to
the
two-way
street,
and
that
is
the
bill
of
rights
are
designed
to
protect
against
erroneous
convictions.
i
don't
think
this
court
has
ever
articulated
the
rule
that
less
protection
against
conviction
can
somehow
be
balanced
off
by
a
greater
chance
of
acquittal.
i
dare
say
if
the
state
adopted
a
procedure
that
prohibited
the
right
to
counsel
and
also
said
no
out-of-court
statements
of
the
defendant
could
be
admitted,
something
good
for
them,
something
bad
for
them,
i
don't
think
it
would
last
five
minutes
in
this
court.
there
has
never
been
a
--
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
yes,
sir,
and,
particularly,
against
erroneous
convictions.
and,
i'm
saying
that
while
there
is
that
18%
out
of
82%
of
the
mix,
kalven
seem
to
go
in
favor
for
acquittal,
i
doubt
that
that
is
a
justification
even
if
it
was
even,
even
if
it
was
50-50.
i
don't
think
that's
a
justification
for
reducing
historic
standards.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
i
think
it
is
the
accuracy
of
the
result.
i
think
unanimity
bears
some
--
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
less
accurate
and
given
the
context
of
the
historic
preference
for
protecting
against
the
conviction
of
an
innocent
man.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
no,
less
certainty,
not
less
accuracy,
no.
i
think
you
can't
be
sure
about
the
less
accuracy.
that's
true,
mr.
justice
white,
but
i
think
that
there
is
less
certainty
about
the
finding
of
guilt
which
this
court
in
winship
and
in
numerous
cases,
it
has
indicated
as
a
prime
function
of
the
requisites
of
the
procedure
in
criminal
trials.
i'd
like
to
briefly
touch
on
our
last
points.
we
think,
although
i
don't
have
time
to
explore
the
point
at
length,
that
the
requirement
of
unanimity
has
an
important
relationship
with
the
jury
cases
in
this
court
having
to
do
with
a
cross-section
of
the
community
participating
in
the
jury
decisions.
i
think
that
there
is
something
ironic
about
almost
100
years
of
case
after
case
in
this
court
concerning
the
panel
from
which
the
jury
must
be
drawn,
leading
to
the
possibility
that
the
newly
included
persons,
the
cross-section
people
first
included
on
juries,
minorities
particularly
now
can
be
ousted
from
participation
in
the
verdict
by
a
rule
which
allows
a
9-3
or
10-2
vote
and
could
conceivably
be
a
9-3
vote
against
the
vote,
the
voice
of
the
very
people
that
100
years
of
decisions
of
this
court
have
secured
the
right
to
participate.
i
think
the
right
to
participate,
at
the
very
least,
means
the
right
to
participate
in
the
process
of
deliberation
of
the
jury
and
the
rendition
of
a
verdict,
not
simply
to
sit
in
a
jury
box
and
go
in
and
watch
your
vote
which
is
--
could
possibly
go
against
them.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
no,
but
the
rationale
of
this
court's
opinions
on
cross-section
juries
have
always
been
articulated
in
terms
of
the
importance
to
the
defendant
of
not
having
his
guilt
determined
by
a
group
from
which
his
peers
have
been
excluded.
that
has
not
been
the
rationale
of
the
election
cases
and
i'm
saying
that
when
that
process
is
completed
and
for
example
in
louisiana,
black
people,
after
much
litigation,
are
included
on
juries,
to
have
the
9-3
rule
which
potentially
puts
them
out
of
the
participatory
process,
runs
against
those
cases
and
that
a
necessary
implementation
of
the
cross-section
cases
is
a
rule
that
when
you
get
people
on
the
jury,
they
have
a
right
to
participate
in
the
process
which
the
majority
verdict
rule
can
substantially
undercut.
the
--
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
not
if
they
go
into
--
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
not
if
they
go
into
a
jury
room
and
have
a
first
vote
which
is
9-3
and
come
back
into
court,
which
is
the
record
in
some
of
these
cases.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
i
don't
think
it's
participating
when
they
don't
get
to
express
their
view
of
the
evidence
where
they
don't
get
to
engage
in
what
the
jury
has
historically
been
which
is
a
process
of
deliberation
between
the
two
opposing
points
of
view
in
that
court
room.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
it's
possible.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
at
least,
but
i
think
--
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
well,
i
think
when
we're
talking
about
altering
a
time-honored
constitutional
procedure
which
goes
back
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
to
almost
100
years
in
terms
of
unanimity
in
jury
process
which
is
integrally
related
to
the
burden
of
proof,
when
a
change
in
that
is
proposed,
a
radical
change
in
that
is
proposed
in
terms
of
the
functioning
of
the
jury
trial,
the
chances
of
that
change
in
procedure,
weakening
protections
is
a
very
important
consideration
because
the
court
can
never
be
sure
of
a
thing
like
that.
all
it
can
look
at
is
what
the
prospects
are
that
this
alteration
of
procedure
will
have
that
impact,
will
have
the
impact
on
offsetting
a
guaranteed
right.
in
this
moment,
i'm
referring
to
the
cross-section
right,
but
i
think
that
also
goes
to
the
reasonable
doubt.
i
can't
argue
to
this
court
that
there
is
not
reasonable
doubt
in
one
of
these
cases.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
the
standard
of
its
determination
has
been
lessened.
lastly,
i
would
like
to
just
touch
for
a
moment
on
the
practicalities
here
that
unlike
the
case
in
williams
where
many
states
had
juries
fewer
than
12,
here
there
were
only
two
states
that
have
non-majority
--
that
have
non-unanimous
rules
except
for
a
very
small
handful
of
cases
punishable
by
less
than
one
year.
there
are
only
two
states
that
are
substantially
involved
in
this
decision,
oregon
and
louisiana.
secondly,
a
transfer
from
the
system
that
prevails
in
this
state
to
the
historic
constitutional
rule
is
a
very
simple
matter.
it
doesn't
require
calling
more
jurors.
it
doesn't
require
much
at
all.
it
simply
requires
the
judge
to
instruct
the
jury
as
judges
in
48
states
in
the
federal
system
instruct
the
jury
that
they
have
to
bring
in
the
determination
by
a
unanimous
vote.
and,
while
there
will
be
substantially
more
deliberation
as
a
result
of
the
unanimity
rule,
an
important
point
we
think
in
our
favor,
the
increase
in
hung
juries
as
a
result
of
this
was
only
2
or
3%,
but
we
think
that's
a
very
important
2
or
3%
because
those
are
cases
in
which
there
was
substantial
and
prolonged
doubt,
and
that
doubt
should
lead
to
either
a
retrial
or
at
least
not
a
finding
of
guilt
in
those
circumstances.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
these
cases
are
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
oregon.
the
issue
is
similar
to
that
involved
in
the
preceding
case,
but
different
in
a
very
fundamental
respect.
the
--
each
of
these
three
criminal
convictions
were
tried
after
the
date
of
this
court's
decision
in
duncan
versus
louisiana,
and
under
the
holding
of
destefano
against
woods,
therefore,
the
cases
that
i
am
now
about
to
argue
are
governed
by
the
duncan
rule
by
which
this
court
held
that
sixth
amendment
right
to
trial
by
jury
by
virtue
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
applicable
to
the
state
criminal
proceedings.
as
a
result
of
that
holding,
the
primary
question
before
the
court
in
these
cases
is
whether
the
sixth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
secures
unanimity
in
jury
trials.
the
petitioners
in
each
of
the
--
each
of
the
three
petitioners
in
these
cases
were
convicted
of
a
serious
crime
by
less
than
a
unanimous
jury
in
the
state
of
oregon
in
accordance
with
the
procedures
set
forth
in
article
i,
section
11
of
the
oregon
constitution
which
permits
a
jury
to
render
a
verdict
of
guilty
other
than
murder
in
the
first
degree
by
10
out
of
12
votes
with
2
jurors
in
disagreement
before
the
sentence.
in
the
madden
case,
the
charge
was
grand
larceny.
the
record
shows
the
jury
was
out
less
than
30
minutes
and
rendered
a
verdict
of
guilty
by
11-1
and
madden
was
sentenced
to
3
years
in
prison.
in
the
apodaca
case,
the
charge
was
assault
with
a
deadly
weapon.
the
jury
was
out
for
41
minutes.
they
rendered
a
verdict
of
guilty
by
a
vote
of
11-1,
and
apodaca
was
sentenced
to
5
years
in
prison.
in
the
cooper
case,
the
charge
was
burglary
in
a
dwelling.
the
jury
was
out
for
51
minutes
and
rendered
a
verdict
by
a
vote
of
10-2,
and
cooper
was
sentenced
to
three-and-half
years
in
prison.
each
of
the
cases
was
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
oregon
which
followed
the
recent
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
which,
by
a
4-3
vote
in
state
began,
held
that
interpreting
duncan
that
the
rule
of
unanimity,
historic
rule
of
unanimity,
was
not
incorporated
by
the
sixth
amendment
and
was
not
applicable
to
the
states.
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
denied
review
in
these
cases
and
this
court
granted
certiorari.
in
williams
against
florida,
decided
last
term,
this
court
held
that
only
those
common
law
requisites
of
trial
by
jury
that
are
fundamental
in
their
purpose
that
are
essential
to
the
functioning
of
a
jury
as
an
institution
secured
by
the
sixth
amendment,
and
the
mere
fact
that
a
procedure
was
part
of
the
jury
requisites,
a
common
law
does
not
itself
satisfy
the
standard
for
inclusion
in
the
sixth
amendment
unless
there
is
a
showing
that
that
procedure
is
fundamental.
our
argument
here
is
plainly
within
the
holding
of
williams.
we
think
that
there
was,
as
the
court
said
in
williams,
there
was
no
showing
that
the
number
12
could
be
shown
to
have
served
any
special
or
significant
function.
we
think
there
are
several
reasons,
why
the
requirement
of
unanimity
serves
important
functions
for
the
jury,
and
it's
on
this
basis,
we
ask
the
court,
applying
to
williams
holding
to
hold
that
the
right
of
unanimity
was
incorporated
by
the
sixth
amendment
and
is
therefore,
applicable
to
the
trial
of
these
petitioners.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
i'm
not
making
the
argument,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
we
automatically
have
a
rule
of
unanimity
because
of
common
law
history.
i'm
accepting
the
test
articulated
by
the
court
in
williams,
and
that
is
that
it
is
not
bound
by
history
on
this
point,
that
both
the
common
law
history
and
the
constitutional
history
leave
the
question
open.
that's
what
this
court
said
and
that
the
issue,
therefore,
for
the
court
to
decide
in
each
instance
is
the
fundamental
nature
of
the
requisite
in
issue
--
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
on
the
standard
of
the
--
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
no,
the
constitution.
mr.
justice
white
said
for
the
court
in
williams
that,
in
each
case
in
which
there
is
a
question
of
whether
a
jury
requisite
is
incorporated
in
the
sixth
amendment,
as
part
of
the
sixth
amendment
guarantee,
it
will
look
to
the
historic
purposes
of
the
jury,
the
functioning
of
the
jury,
and
determine
and
interpreting
the
word
“jury”
in
the
sixth
amendment
which
is
what
--
the
text
we
looked
to,
what
that
word
“jury”
means.
it
certainly
means
something,
and
we
think
that
there
are
some
of
the
common
law
requisites
that
are
incorporated
by
the
use
of
the
word
“jury”
in
the
sixth
amendment
and
as
the
court
held
in
williams,
some
are
not.
and,
the
test
in
interpreting
the
word
“jury”
in
the
sixth
amendment
which
is
the
source,
that
the
test
is
the
fundamental
nature
of
the
essential
purposes
of
the
requisite
in
issue
in
terms
of
jury
trial.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
in
answer
to
that
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
just
take
the
holding
of
the
court
in
williams
that
the
history
of
an
effort
to
make
the
sixth
amendment
more
specific
by
including
the
word
“unanimity”
in
the
sixth
amendment
can
be
read
either
way.
it
can
be
read
to
be
interpreted,
as
mr.
justice
holland
said
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
williams,
that
it
was
so
much
assumed
that
the
requirement
of
unanimity
and
12
men
in
that
case
was
incorporated
by
the
use
of
the
word
“jury,”
there
was
no
necessity
for
particularization.
it
could
also
be
argued
that
that
was
not
assumed,
that
an
effort
was
made,
and
that
the
effort
failed
and
that
has
significance.
this
court's
interpretation
in
williams
of
that
history
said
the
question
is
open,
that
we
cannot
--
there
is
not
enough
guidance
either
way
from
the
history.
examining
that
very
process
of
mr.
madison's
proposed
amendment,
it's
consideration,
it's
passage
on
one
side,
it's
defeat
on
the
other,
and
it's
ultimate
defeat,
this
court
considering
that
history
said
the
question
is
open.
now,
we
look
to
fundamentalness.
i
approach
this
case
exactly
within
the
test
which
was
framed
by
the
court
in
williams,
and
i
would
like
to
argue
to
the
court
that
in
at
least
three
respects,
three
very
important
respects,
the
requirement
of
unanimity
serves
that
fundamental
function
that
the
court
was
talking
about
in
williams
when
it
said
we
are
going
to
only
incorporate
those
that
serve
a
fundamental
function.
and
the
functions
that
we
think
it
does
serve
that
are
fundamental
is
its
effect
on
the
process
of
deliberation,
its
effect
on
the
government's
burden
of
proof,
and
its
effect
on
the
constitutional
requirements,
that
a
cross-section
of
the
community
participate
in
jury
decisions.
i'd
like
to
briefly
take
those
up
--
each
one
up
without
repeating
unnecessarily
on
the
argument
in
the
case
that
preceded.
the
court
--
this
court
in
allen
against
united
states,
in
1896,
said
the
very
object
of
the
jury
system
is
to
secure
unanimity
by
a
comparison
of
views
and
by
arguments
among
the
jurors
themselves.
the
process
of
group
deliberation
by
jury
tests
the
juror's
understanding
of
the
evidence,
requires
dissenting
and
majority
views
in
order
to
reach
a
verdict
come
out
of
the
jury
room,
requires
them
to
put
their
impressions
of
the
evidence
to
a
test,
and
has
historically
been
recognized
as
a
very
important
safeguard
in
weeding
out
erroneous
or
misunderstandings
of
the
evidence.
the
requirement
of
unanimity,
wherever
there
is
any
dissenter
in
the
jury
room,
requires
that
the
jury
discuss
the
case
and
come
out
with
some
kind
of
consensus
upon
full
discussion
and
consideration
of
the
issues.
now,
the
majority
verdict
rule
undercuts
deliberation
in
two
respects.
when
the
first
vote
of
the
jury
shows
that
there
is
the
requisite
majority
for
a
verdict,
regardless
of
whether
there
any
dissenters,
there
is
no
deliberation
at
all
and
the
jury
comes
back
to
the
court
room
and
renders
its
verdict.
in
a
case
of
that
kind,
even
though
one
or
two
jurors
in
the
oregon
procedure
or
one,
two,
or
three
jurors
in
the
louisiana
procedure
have
objections
to
the
finding
of
guilt
feel
that
there
is
doubt
about
the
evidence,
there
is
no
opportunity
whatsoever
for
them
to
so
much
as
express
their
views
and
have
the
possibility
of
them
convincing
the
majority
of
the
correctness
of
their
views,
there's
no
deliberation
whatsoever.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
well,
we
don't
know
about
any
particular
jury
whether
it
does
or
it
does
not,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
but,
the
time
that
the
juries
in
these
cases
were
out
for
example,
which
in
all
cases
was
less
than
an
hour
and
in
one
case
was
less
than
half
an
hour,
is
very
strong
indication
of
that.
more
important
indication
of
that
is
the
fact
that,
again
going
back
to
kalven
&
zeisel,
which
seems
to
be
the
text
in
terms
of
jury
functioning
that
in
the
state
of
oregon
and
the
state
of
louisiana,
25%
of
jury
verdicts
are
split
verdicts,
whereas,
across
the
country,
only
5%
of
the
juries
hang.
so,
if
those
facts,
if
that
survey
is
accurate,
it
would
indicate
that
in
many,
many
cases,
five
times
as
often
as
a
jury
would
hang,
the
deliberative
process
is
short-circuited
by
the
fact
that
the
--
a
certain
number
of
jurors
are
entitled
to
render
a
verdict
under
the
constitutional
procedure
at
issue.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
possibly,
it
can
happen.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
i
mean
possibly
because
that
won't
often
happen,
because
he's
--
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
because
they're
instructed
by
the
court
to
engage
in
the
process
of
deliberation.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
well,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
cannot
guarantee
in
any
particular
case
that
the
fact
that
there
are
10
jurors
for
conviction
and
2
for
acquittal
in
a
jurisdiction
where
unanimity
is
required,
meaning
there
will
be
discussion,
but
in
95%
of
the
criminal
cases
tried
in
this
country,
there
is
a
judgment.
there
is
a
verdict.
only
5%
are
hung.
that,
plus
the
court's
instructions
to
the
jury
is
very
strong
indication,
i
would
think,
that
except
for
the
aberrational
situation,
when
the
jurors
take
their
first
ballot
and
find
themselves
in
disagreement
they
will
discuss
the
case.
i
can't
guarantee
that
that
would
happen.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
excuse
me,
i
didn't
hear.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
i
have
no
choice
at
this
point.
i
do
accept
a
six-man
jury.
i
--
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
the
issue
in
this
case
is
unanimity.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
in
this
case,
yes,
sir.
and
in
oregon,
as
it
happens,
the
jury
size
is
12
with
10
members
concurring
it.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
well
--
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
in
terms
of
what
ultimately
happens?
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
the
only
figures
i
have
seen
are
the
figures
in
kalven
&
zeisel
in
which
--
and
those
authors
say
that
it
is
rare
in
those
cases
for
the
jury
to
be
100%
turned
around,
and
if
the
vote
is
9-3,
a
10-2
conviction
come
out
for
acquittal.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
the
initial
split
in
the
hung
jury
cases,
the
evidence
seems
to
be,
is
closer
than
10-2
or
11-1.
it's
more
like
8-4
or
7-5
with
--
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
--
with
some
of
the
dissenting
jurors
changing
their
mind
--
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
and
some,
holding
their
own.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
it
depends
on
the
stage
you
get
it.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
if
you
get
it
after
two
--
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
yes,
sir.
if
you
get
it
after
two
days
of
deliberation,
the
chances
are
very
strong
that
the
jury
is
going
to
be
locked.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
when
it
starts
out,
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
8-7.[attempt
to
laughter]
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
it's
probably
going
to
stay
there,
but
the
procedures
that
are
at
issue
in
this
case
--
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
probably,
that's
all
that
the
court
can
say
based
on
the
evidence.
on
the
deliberation
point,
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that,
quantitatively,
the
most
important
function
of
this
majority
verdict
rule
is
not
to
avoid
hung
juries,
but
to
short-circuit
the
process
of
deliberation
because
as
i've
indicated,
25%
of
the
criminal
trials
in
these
jurisdictions
result
in
split
verdicts
in
situations
where
the
nationwide
evidence
is
very
strong
that
a
consensus
would
be
reached,
an
unanimous
jury
verdict
would
be
reached.
so
a
very
important
function,
a
very
important
product,
not
functions
in
the
sense
it's
intended,
but
a
very
important
product
of
the
rules
of
allowing
majority
verdicts
is
that
the
historic
deliberative
process
of
the
jury
is
short-circuited.
in
going
back
to
williams,
i
would
suggest
the
process
of
the
jury
deliberating
together,
exchanging
views,
considering
the
views
of
everybody
in
the
jury
room
is
one
of
the
fundamental
requisites
of
the
jury
system
which
we
--
i
would
argue,
under
williams,
is
incorporated.
now,
oregon
makes
a
peculiar
kind
of
answer
to
this
assertion.
it
points
to
the
english
statute
which
was
adopted
in
1967
which
establishes
a
minimum
period
of
deliberation
before
the
jury
verdict
by
a
10-1
or
11-1
vote
can
be
received
and
says,
“well,
there
are
other
ways
of
doing
it”
and,
my
answer
to
that
is
perhaps
there
are
other
ways
of
doing
it.
perhaps,
unanimity
is
not
the
only
way
of
assuring
deliberation.
i
happen
to
think
it's
the
best,
but
the
important
point
for
this
is
the
court
hasn't
got
that
before
it.
when
some
state,
some
american
state,
adopts
a
procedure
of
majority
verdicts
and
a
minimum
period
of
deliberation,
the
court
can
then
consider
the
question
whether
that
comports
with
the
constitutional
requirements,
whether
that's
sufficient
safeguard.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
excuse
me?
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
no,
sir,
not
in
criminal
cases.
no,
sir,
we
don't.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
in
civil
cases
which
is
a
different
amendment,
yes,
sir.
but,
the
court
has
not
had
the
question
and
certainly
doesn't
have
the
question
on
the
criminal
side
of
what
the
constitutional
implications
would
be
of
the
english
statute.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
certainly.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
yes,
sir,
and
that's
the
point
i'm
about
to
get
to
as
the
second
essential
fundamental
purpose
of
trial
by
a
unanimous
jury.
we
think
the
requirement
of
the
unanimity
is
closely
related
to
the
requirement
of
burden
--
to
the
burden
of
proof
imposed
on
the
government
in
a
criminal
case.
in
winship,
this
court
articulated
it
as
a
constitutional
matter
that
that
burden
of
proof
was
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
but
beyond
the
particular
articulation,
it
has
always
been
clear
that
there
is
a
very
high
burden
of
proof
on
the
government
in
criminal
cases
and
that
burden
of
proof
in
practice
means,
and
has
always
meant,
one
thing,
and
that
is
convincing
everybody
in
the
jury
room
of
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
it's
perfectly
clear,
as
the
preceding
argument
seem
to
acknowledge,
that
where
less
jurors
than
12
can
convict
or
less
jurors
than
all
can
convict,
it
is
easier
to
convict,
less
evidence
is
needed.
now,
i
don't
think
the
question
--
to
give
my
response
to
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
the
question
in
a
due
process
in
a
criminal
procedure
case
before
this
court
is
simply
whether
convictions
are
harder
or
easier,
obviously
not.
i
think
the
question
is
much
more
complicated
than
that,
but
in
this
case
there
are
two
points
that
distinguish
that.
one
is
that
you
have
an
historic
system
for
the
functioning
of
the
reasonable
doubt
standard.
reasonable
doubt
means
you
convince
everybody
in
the
jury
room
of
something.
when
you
tinker
with
that
standard,
when
you
say
two-thirds
will
do
or
three-quarters
will
do
or
five
or
six
will
do,
you
are
lowering
the
government's
burden
of
proof.
you
are
altering
whatever
“guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt”
has
always
meant.
it's
being
altered
in
these
cases
and
less
proof
will
do.
now,
the
second
thing
which
i
think,
which
i
think
is
a
very
important
aspect
of
this,
is
that
this
is
not
a
case
where
we're
saying
a
particular
procedural
rule
will
alter
the
rate
of
convictions
in
the
sense
of
their
exclusion
of
confessions
or
exclusion
of
illegally
seized
evidence
where
the
countervailing
factor
is
not
the
correctness
of
the
fact-finding
but
police
conduct
or
administrative
conduct
where
other
factors
are
being
weighed
against
the
probable
outcome
of
a
criminal
trial.
here,
the
alteration
before
the
court
affects
the
integrity
of
the
fact-finding
process.
as
the
opinions
of
a
court
in
winship
recognized,
whenever
there
is
an
ex
post
facto
determination
of
facts,
whenever
some
later
body
is
determining
what
happened,
there's
always
a
chance
of
error.
the
tradition
of
this
country
is
that
chance
of
error
is
reduced
to
what
is
considered
an
acceptable
point
by
requiring
every
juror
to
concur
in
the
determination
of
the
jury.
when
less
jurors
have
to
concur,
obviously,
there
is
an
increase
risk
of
error,
and
that's
what's
before
the
court,
a
procedure
which
allows
a
lessening
of
the
historic
protection
against
an
erroneous
conviction,
the
conviction
of
an
innocent
man.
now
--
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
yes,
that's
true,
and
i'm
certain
that
happens,
but
the
--
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
well,
i
think
i
can
for
this
reason.
the
kalven
and
zeisel
study,
again,
shows
--
had
found
that
it
is
a
very
unusual
case
where
a
jury
which
has
split
11-1
or
10-2
at
the
outset
will
eventually
hang.
the
notion
of
a
stubborn
juror
is
one
that
the
examination
of
criminal
trials
does
not
seem
to
support,
rather,
their
finding
is
that
when
a
jury
will
ultimately
hang
by
an
11-1
or
10-2
vote,
that
jury
is
one
which
was
much
more
closely
divided
at
the
outset
and
was
divided
in
response
to
very
substantial
difficulties
in
the
government's
case.
and
while
the
give
and
take
of
the
process
of
deliberation
had
its
inevitable
effect
on
some
of
the
dissenters,
that
where
one
or
two
are
left,
they
are
the
representatives
of
the
remnants
of
a
much
larger
body
of
initial
dissenters,
which
would
indicate
that
it's
not
just
an
aberration
of
one
or
two
jurors
at
the
outset
flouting
the
opinion
of
a
much
larger
group,
but
that
it's
a
process
which
evolves
from
a
very
substantial
minority
at
the
outset.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
that
is
true,
but
if
it's
a
two-way
street,
it's
a
very
steep
hill
because
the
figures
indicate
that
where
juries
are
deadlocked
11-1
and
10-2,
in
over
80%
of
those
cases,
they're
voting
for
conviction.
that
it's
something
in
the
neighborhood
of
18%
of
juries
that
are
split
by
those
votes
at
favor
acquittal.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
at
the
ultimate
deadlock,
so
what
i'm
--
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
yes,
sir,
that's
true.
but,
when
that
point
is
reached
in
oregon
is
when
the
verdict
is
allowed.
if
there
was
a
greater
division
in
the
first
place,
they
were
not,
by
virtue
of
a
constitutional
provision,
requiring
10
votes
--
allowed
to
come
in.
the
difference
between
the
oregon
procedure
and
the
procedure
in
the
other
states
is
that,
at
that
point,
a
verdict
can
be
--
the
jury
is
not
hung
when
it's
10-2
or
11-1,
but
a
verdict
can
be
rendered.
what
i'm
trying
to
indicate
is
that,
in
those
situations,
over
80%
of
those
cases
are
convictions.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
this
is,
again,
sir,
is
kalven
&
zeisel.
secondly,
i
would
--
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
yes,
sir.
there's
a
constitutional
right
to
unanimity,
which
means
the
constitutional
right
to
having
a
hung
jury.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
yes,
sir.
i
don't
know
that
you
have
a
right
to
be
retried,
but
yes,
if
the
prosecutor
wants
to
retry
--
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
correct.
right.[attempt
to
laughter]
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
no,
sir.
i
have
to
go
on
the
process
of
deliberation.
i
have
to
go
on
what's
the
function
--
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
well,
it's
a
process,
mr.
justice
marshall.
the
sixth
amendment
says
right
to
trial
by
jury.
this
court
in
williams
said
that
means
those
fundamental
requisites
--
those
requisites
that
can
be
shown
fundamental
are
in
that
word,
in
that
word
“jury.”
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
i
think
it
does
include
it.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
excuse
me?
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
williams
leaves
the
question.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
reserved
the
question
in
williams.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
yes,
sir.
i'm
not
arguing
anything
else.
it
was
reserved.
it
was
not
decided
by
williams,
but
the
test
articulated
by
the
court
in
williams,
i
think
resolves
this
case
in
my
favor
because
i
think
that
we
can
show,
and
have
shown,
that
there
is
a
fundamental
purpose.
it's
not
mystical
or
arbitrary
quality
of
trial
by
jury
the
way
12
was
found
to
be,
but
has
a
fundamental
purpose.
if
i
may
go
back
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question,
i
think
there's
one
other
answer
to
the
two-way
street,
and
that
is
the
bill
of
rights
are
designed
to
protect
against
erroneous
convictions.
i
don't
think
this
court
has
ever
articulated
the
rule
that
less
protection
against
conviction
can
somehow
be
balanced
off
by
a
greater
chance
of
acquittal.
i
dare
say
if
the
state
adopted
a
procedure
that
prohibited
the
right
to
counsel
and
also
said
no
out-of-court
statements
of
the
defendant
could
be
admitted,
something
good
for
them,
something
bad
for
them,
i
don't
think
it
would
last
five
minutes
in
this
court.
there
has
never
been
a
--
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
yes,
sir,
and,
particularly,
against
erroneous
convictions.
and,
i'm
saying
that
while
there
is
that
18%
out
of
82%
of
the
mix,
kalven
seem
to
go
in
favor
for
acquittal,
i
doubt
that
that
is
a
justification
even
if
it
was
even,
even
if
it
was
50-50.
i
don't
think
that's
a
justification
for
reducing
historic
standards.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
i
think
it
is
the
accuracy
of
the
result.
i
think
unanimity
bears
some
--
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
less
accurate
and
given
the
context
of
the
historic
preference
for
protecting
against
the
conviction
of
an
innocent
man.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
no,
less
certainty,
not
less
accuracy,
no.
i
think
you
can't
be
sure
about
the
less
accuracy.
that's
true,
mr.
justice
white,
but
i
think
that
there
is
less
certainty
about
the
finding
of
guilt
which
this
court
in
winship
and
in
numerous
cases,
it
has
indicated
as
a
prime
function
of
the
requisites
of
the
procedure
in
criminal
trials.
i'd
like
to
briefly
touch
on
our
last
points.
we
think,
although
i
don't
have
time
to
explore
the
point
at
length,
that
the
requirement
of
unanimity
has
an
important
relationship
with
the
jury
cases
in
this
court
having
to
do
with
a
cross-section
of
the
community
participating
in
the
jury
decisions.
i
think
that
there
is
something
ironic
about
almost
100
years
of
case
after
case
in
this
court
concerning
the
panel
from
which
the
jury
must
be
drawn,
leading
to
the
possibility
that
the
newly
included
persons,
the
cross-section
people
first
included
on
juries,
minorities
particularly
now
can
be
ousted
from
participation
in
the
verdict
by
a
rule
which
allows
a
9-3
or
10-2
vote
and
could
conceivably
be
a
9-3
vote
against
the
vote,
the
voice
of
the
very
people
that
100
years
of
decisions
of
this
court
have
secured
the
right
to
participate.
i
think
the
right
to
participate,
at
the
very
least,
means
the
right
to
participate
in
the
process
of
deliberation
of
the
jury
and
the
rendition
of
a
verdict,
not
simply
to
sit
in
a
jury
box
and
go
in
and
watch
your
vote
which
is
--
could
possibly
go
against
them.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
no,
but
the
rationale
of
this
court's
opinions
on
cross-section
juries
have
always
been
articulated
in
terms
of
the
importance
to
the
defendant
of
not
having
his
guilt
determined
by
a
group
from
which
his
peers
have
been
excluded.
that
has
not
been
the
rationale
of
the
election
cases
and
i'm
saying
that
when
that
process
is
completed
and
for
example
in
louisiana,
black
people,
after
much
litigation,
are
included
on
juries,
to
have
the
9-3
rule
which
potentially
puts
them
out
of
the
participatory
process,
runs
against
those
cases
and
that
a
necessary
implementation
of
the
cross-section
cases
is
a
rule
that
when
you
get
people
on
the
jury,
they
have
a
right
to
participate
in
the
process
which
the
majority
verdict
rule
can
substantially
undercut.
the
--
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
not
if
they
go
into
--
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
not
if
they
go
into
a
jury
room
and
have
a
first
vote
which
is
9-3
and
come
back
into
court,
which
is
the
record
in
some
of
these
cases.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
i
don't
think
it's
participating
when
they
don't
get
to
express
their
view
of
the
evidence
where
they
don't
get
to
engage
in
what
the
jury
has
historically
been
which
is
a
process
of
deliberation
between
the
two
opposing
points
of
view
in
that
court
room.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
it's
possible.
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
at
least,
but
i
think
--
mr.
robert
b.
sobol
well,
i
think
when
we're
talking
about
altering
a
time-honored
constitutional
procedure
which
goes
back
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
to
almost
100
years
in
terms
of
unanimity
in
jury
process
which
is
integrally
related
to
the
burden
of
proof,
when
a
change
in
that
is
proposed,
a
radical
change
in
that
is
proposed
in
terms
of
the
functioning
of
the
jury
trial,
the
chances
of
that
change
in
procedure,
weakening
protections
is
a
very
important
consideration
because
the
court
can
never
be
sure
of
a
thing
like
that.
all
it
can
look
at
is
what
the
prospects
are
that
this
alteration
of
procedure
will
have
that
impact,
will
have
the
impact
on
offsetting
a
guaranteed
right.
in
this
moment,
i'm
referring
to
the
cross-section
right,
but
i
think
that
also
goes
to
the
reasonable
doubt.
i
can't
argue
to
this
court
that
there
is
not
reasonable
doubt
in
one
of
these
cases.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
the
standard
of
its
determination
has
been
lessened.
lastly,
i
would
like
to
just
touch
for
a
moment
on
the
practicalities
here
that
unlike
the
case
in
williams
where
many
states
had
juries
fewer
than
12,
here
there
were
only
two
states
that
have
non-majority
--
that
have
non-unanimous
rules
except
for
a
very
small
handful
of
cases
punishable
by
less
than
one
year.
there
are
only
two
states
that
are
substantially
involved
in
this
decision,
oregon
and
louisiana.
secondly,
a
transfer
from
the
system
that
prevails
in
this
state
to
the
historic
constitutional
rule
is
a
very
simple
matter.
it
doesn't
require
calling
more
jurors.
it
doesn't
require
much
at
all.
it
simply
requires
the
judge
to
instruct
the
jury
as
judges
in
48
states
in
the
federal
system
instruct
the
jury
that
they
have
to
bring
in
the
determination
by
a
unanimous
vote.
and,
while
there
will
be
substantially
more
deliberation
as
a
result
of
the
unanimity
rule,
an
important
point
we
think
in
our
favor,
the
increase
in
hung
juries
as
a
result
of
this
was
only
2
or
3%,
but
we
think
that's
a
very
important
2
or
3%
because
those
are
cases
in
which
there
was
substantial
and
prolonged
doubt,
and
that
doubt
should
lead
to
either
a
retrial
or
at
least
not
a
finding
of
guilt
in
those
circumstances.
