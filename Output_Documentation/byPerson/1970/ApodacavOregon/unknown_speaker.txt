unknown
speaker
in
your
view
would
a
minimum
period
for
deliberation
make
a
difference,
mr.
sobol?
unknown
speaker
mr.
sobol,
as
you
do
so,
those
are
good
arguments
for
a
policy
matter.
will
you
emphasize
the
constitutional
aspect
sought
from
as
you
go
along.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sobol.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
mr.
solbol,
help
me
out
a
little
bit.
if
oregon
provided
for
24
man
juries
instead
of
12,
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
what
your
argument
amounts
to
is
this.
if
you
had
a
10:2
vote,
the
jury,
you
would
like
to
have
a
hang
at
that
point
if
there
were
no
ultimate
persuasion,
then
you
would
be
content
with
a
new
trial
and
then
if
a
second
trial
came
along
on
precisely
the
same
evidence.
now,
i
realize
that
is
a
big
assumption
and
the
jury
convicted.
actually,
your
vote
would
be
22:2
and
yet
you
would
be
content
with
this
result.
unknown
speaker
well,
then
i
guess
what
i
am
suggesting
that
it
maybe
an
invalid
assumption
is
that
a
lot
depends
on
the
luck
of
the
draw,
of
the
jury
composition.
unknown
speaker
you
must
go
and
get
a
better
picture
over
there,
how
many
of
them
are
convicted
in
retrial?
unknown
speaker
that
i
do
not
think
is
true--
unknown
speaker
mr.
sobol,
wanted
to
tell,
it
slipped
my
mind.
if
you
have
a
vote
of
10:2
for
acquittal,
under
the
oregon
system,
is
that
an
acquittal
or
is
it
a
hung
jury
and
not
acquittal.
unknown
speaker
is
an
acquittal?
unknown
speaker
and
you
would
not
object
to
that?
unknown
speaker
in
any
large
city
today,
have
you
ever
heard
of
a
cross
section
jury?
what
you
mean
is
the
panel
to
be
a
cross
section.
unknown
speaker
but
not
the
individual
jury.
unknown
speaker
would
you
agree
that
a
cross
section
of
new
york,
you
have
to
have
about
40
jurors?
unknown
speaker
on
your
point
about
persuading
them,
to
prosecute
a
job,
he
would
not
work
as
hard
with
a
six-man
jury
as
he
would
with
12,
is
that
your
argument?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
you
say
that
does
not
work
if
it
is
attended
to
vote
for
acquittal
because
the
protection
is
against
improper
conviction.
the
same
theory
does
not
work.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
in
terms
of
criminal
case,
what
percentage
the
jury
hangs
in
oregon?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
2%
really
thought
the
–
unknown
speaker
unless
those
who
might
be
convicted
on
this
court.
unknown
speaker
less
might
be.
unknown
speaker
which
way
the
jury
hangs.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
if
that
judgment
although
going
to
be
applied
to
a
jury
trial
but
necessarily--
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
that
oregon
provides
for
fair
trial?
unknown
speaker
even
though
it
said
so?
unknown
speaker
so
do
you
want
a
jury
trial?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
you
would
not
accept
it?
unknown
speaker
this
was
an
amendment,
was
it
of
the
argument
constitution?
unknown
speaker
1934?
unknown
speaker
right.
they
provided
an
ordinance
for
fair
trial?
unknown
speaker
are
you
speaking
for
retrial?
unknown
speaker
well
then
mr.
tanzer,
you
would
make
the
same
argument
if
the
oregon
system
were
7:5.
unknown
speaker
mr.
tanzer,
in
oregon,
if
the
jury
goes
out,
they
always
take
a
first
vote,
all
of
you
usually
and
if
it
is
to
overwrite
if
the
first
vote
is
10:2
that
is
dammed
of
it?
unknown
speaker
well
it
could.
unknown
speaker
if
the
jury
goes
out
and
takes
an
original
vote
and
the
vote
is
10:2
what
happens
to
that
word
deliberation?
unknown
speaker
they
are
empowered
to
return
a
verdict
without
deliberation.
unknown
speaker
without
deliberation,
but
10:2,
people
to
take
the
state
has
approved
in
and
i
assume
they
cannot
even
say
that.
unknown
speaker
is
it
authorized?
unknown
speaker
why
have
twelve,
why
not
have
ten-men
jury?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
what
we
have
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
any
movement
to
make
that
majority
too?
unknown
speaker
not
yet.
unknown
speaker
if
you
cut
it
down
to
a
family
judge,
you
would
save
more
time,
would
you
not?
unknown
speaker
we
must
assume
a
certain
good
faith
in
our
juries.
unknown
speaker
in
your
view
would
a
minimum
period
for
deliberation
make
a
difference,
mr.
sobol?
unknown
