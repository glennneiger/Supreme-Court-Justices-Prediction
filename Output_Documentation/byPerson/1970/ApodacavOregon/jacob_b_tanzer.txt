mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
not
repeat
mrs.
korns'
history.
i
found
it
accurate
and
detailed
in
the
brief,
and
mr.
sobol
has
stated
this
case
fairly.
i
would
like
to
say
at
the
outset
that
i
am
defending
the
non-unanimous
jury
verdict
system
not
only
because
we
have
three
cases,
three
convictions,
at
bar
and
several
others
stacked
up
as
certiorari
--
petitions
for
certiorari
pending,
but
because
it
is
a
good
system
and
it
works
and
it
is
to
be
defended.
as
mr.
justice
stewart
indicated
in
his
questioning,
it
is
a
two-way
street.
it
is
not
simply
another
darling
of
the
prosecutor's
nursery.
people
are
acquitted
in
the
same
manner
that
people
are
convicted
by
10-2
verdicts
in
situations
which,
in
another
state,
would
result
in
a
hung
verdict
--
a
hung
jury
and
a
retrial.
and,
to
take
just
a
moment
with
mr.
kalven
&
zeisel,
before
moving
on,
i
do
want
to
dispute
one
thing
and
these
also
were
asked
about.
in
regard
to
the
ultimate
deadlock
statistics
that
they
set
out,
out
of
the
cases
they
have
studied,
they
show
42
cases
deadlocked
at
10-2.
34
of
them,
that's
1%,
were
deadlocked
with
convicting
majorities.
19%
were
convicted
--
were
deadlocked
with
acquitting
majorities
and
in
--
where
i
come
from,
in
multnomah
county,
the
conviction
rate
is
85%.
that
figure
where
those
cases
allowed
to
go
to
10-2
verdicts
would
have
been
favorable
to
the
defendant,
not
to
the
state,
by
an
insignificant
percentage.
and,
in
cases
of
initial
voting,
they
sampled
156
cases
and
of
those,
none,
which
began
at
11-1,
were
hung.
those
which
went
with
initial
votes
of
2
or
3
to
convict
were
hung.
there
were
7%
of
those
hung,
and
the
reverse
situation
there
were
none
hung.
so,
again,
those
are
juries
likely
to
convict
--
pardon
me,
likely
to
acquit
where
7%
were
hung.
so,
even
on
that
statistic,
this
system
--
it
would
seem,
according
to
those
figures,
are
favorable
to
the
defendant
and
not
to
the
state.
i'm
here
to
defend
it
because
oregon
believes
it
to
be
a
good
system
and
the
american
law
institute
agreed
with
that
in
1931
when
it
recommended
it
and
substantially
the
form
which
oregon
adopted,
as
well
as
an
oregon
commission
which
had
many
distinguished
members
including
the
senator
to
be,
wayne
morse.
the
english
adopted
the
same
system,
somewhat
modified,
requiring
a
minimum
deliberation
time
in
1967.
the
american
bar
association
project
on
minimum
standards
of
criminal
justice
have
approved
--
that's
the
wrong
word,
endorsed
the
system
for
us
in
the
american
states
and
a
very
extinguished
panel
both
on
the
groups
which
drafted
the
report
and
the
general
project
committee
headed
by
judge
lombard
which
approved
it
in
1968,
and
i'm
speaking,
therefore,
of
the
approved
draft
and
not
the
tentative
draft.
in
oregon,
as
sort
of
a
lab
model
in
the
federal
system,
has
shown
that
it
works
and
the
experience
in
oregon
has
been
that
it
seems
to
sort
the
innocent
from
the
guilty
and
it
does
it
in
a
way
which
is
fair
and
which
is
accurate
and
which
is
expeditious
and
that's
what
the
criminal
justice
system
is
suppose
to
do.
there
is
no
cry
of
injustice
which
i
am
aware.
there
are
theoretical
objections
raised,
such
as
mr.
sobol's,
but
no
one
has
claimed
injustice,
most
certainly
no
more
so
than
in
states
which
require
unanimity.
kalven
and
zeisel,
in
an
article
--
in
a
subsequent
article
which
they
wrote
as
sort
of
an
advisory
article
to
the
british
who
were
considering
the
criminal
justice
act
of
1967,
recommended
against
adoption
of
that
act,
but
they
also
acknowledged
that
the
oregon
system
works.
it
achieves
justice
fairly.
there's
no
breakdown
of
justice
in
oregon,
and
there
is
no
breakdown
and
no
cry
of
injustice
in
these
cases
either.
two
of
the
defendants
in
the
cases
before
the
court
took
the
stand
and
admitted
guilt.
one
admitted
complicity,
the
other
one
admitted
guilt
and
asked
for
sympathy
and,
in
the
third
case,
he
was
convicted
on
the
basis
of
a
voluntary
confession
and
he
did
not
present
a
case
or,
in
any
way,
deny
it.
they
were
out,
granted,
for
periods
of
under
an
hour,
but
no
jury
faced
with
those
facts
could
or
should
have
acquitted.
those
would've
been
miscarriages
of
justice.
i
do
want
to
briefly
mention
history
which
has
already
been
discussed.
the
senate
did
delete
the
unanimity
requirement
of
the
sixth
amendment.
the
house
failed
to
restore
it.
the
reason
is
clear.
it
is
not
as
mr.
sobol
suggests
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
detail
the
procedure
because
that
was
understood
as
a
part
of
the
amendment.
rather,
we
get
the
history
from
madison's
letter
at
the
time,
which
is
referred
to
in
williams
versus
florida
and
which
i
refer
to
in
the
brief.
we
get
the
similar
history
of
article
iii,
section
2
from
the
federalist
no.
83.
the
reason
it
was
not
included
was
because
the
practice
of
the
states
at
the
time
was
diverse,
and
therefore,
there
was
not
the
inclination
to
lock
all
the
states
into
one
uniform
system
and,
as
the
chief
justice
has
pointed
out,
4
--
at
least
4
of,
which
i'm
aware,
of
the
colonies,
north
carolina
may
have
changed
by
then,
did
practice
non-unanimous
systems
and
that's
4
out
of
13.
new
york
had
a
strange
system
which
the
federalist
refers
to,
where
there
was
an
appeal
as
a
matter
of
right
from
one
jury
to
another
until
somebody
had
2
out
of
3
verdicts,
which
is
essentially
a
24
out
of
36
vote,
two-thirds
vote.
so,
the
practice
was
not
uniform
and
that
is
the
reason
it
was
not
locked
in.
counsel
suggests,
i
think
incorrectly,
that
this
court
write
into
the
sixth
amendment
what
the
senate
or
the
framers
took
out.
the
federal
unanimity,
incidentally,
is
statutory,
at
least
in
my
view.
i
point
out
in
my
brief
at
page
19
that
the
effort
at
the
convention
to
insert
in
article
iii,
section
2
the
language
“and
a
trial
by
jury
shall
be
preserved
as
usual
in
criminal
cases”
was
defeated
and
the
constitutional
conventions
of
eliot's
debates
shows
it
and,
again,
the
argument
was
there's
no
such
thing
as
“as
usual”
at
this
point
of
history
in
the
american
colonies.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
i
can't
tell
you,
your
honor.
i
didn't
research
it
because
it
wasn't
an
issue,
but
i
think
we
can
say
that
it
does
not
come
from
the
constitution
and
since
they
all
do
it,
i
would
expect
--
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
pardon
me?
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
i
don't
know.
i
think
that's
precisely
my
point
though,
your
honor.
it
is
a
legislative
determination
and
not
a
constitutional
one.
i
do
not
--
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
it
most
certainly
has,
your
honor,
in
several
cases.
however,
in
none
of
those
cases
was
unanimity
truly
an
issue.
there
are
a
few
such
as
the
hawaiian
case,
mankichi,
where
unanimity
was
an
issue
but
the
court
sidestepped
the
constitutionality
of
it.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
that's
correct.
same
with
utah,
but
it
was
never
actually
the
issue
of
any
case.
it
was
never
actually
the
issue
which
had
been
resolved.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
you
indicated
in
williams
that
the
question
was
open
and
there
was
some
statement
in
williams
also
that
the
court
reserves
the
right
to
change
its
mind
about
the
sixth
amendment
and,
that,
of
course
is
our
fear.
in
duncan,
the
court
spoke
--
actually
the
historical
argument
would
seem
to
me
--
the
history
of
the
sixth
amendment
would
seem
to
me
to
be
the
end
of
the
issue
in
terms
of
unanimity.
however,
i
wish
to
follow
counsel's
argument
into
other
constitutional
areas.
it's
clear
under
duncan,
given
what
the
english
had
done
and
what
is
the
practice
in
this
country
that
it
is
not
--
unanimity
is
not
an
essential
part
of
the
anglo-american
regime
of
ordered
liberty,
which
was
referred
to
in
the
case.
counsel's
--
the
most
troublesome
problem
i
think
that
counsel
raises
is
the
--
and
the
one
that's
mentioned
in
footnote
46
of
williams
is
the
idea,
which
i
think
to
be
a
false
idea,
that
the
requirement
or
that
the
allowance
of
non-unanimous
verdicts
somehow
reduces
the
standard
of
proof
beyond
reasonable
doubt,
and
i'd
like
to
talk
to
that
point
at
some
length
because
the
other
points
are
not
nearly
as
complex.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
i
will
right
now,
your
honor.
such
a
thing
obviously
can't
happen.
there's
nothing
to
compel
any
jury
to
act
with
integrity.
it
cannot,
but
the
equal
protection
clause
--
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
it
could
happen.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
no,
i
don't
think
--
no,
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
the
oregon
system
also
instructs
jurors
to
listen
to
the
arguments
of
their
other
fellow
jurors
and
to
deliberate.
it
would
be
the
corrupt
jury
which
just
says
“i
do
not
need
to
listen
to
you.
go
wait
in
the
corner,”
but
--
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
yes,
i'm
not
sure
that
that
would
be
an
effective
remedy,
in
all
candor
though,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
if
somebody
is
--
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
certainly,
but
i
think
the
equal
protection
argument
has
to
be
answered
in
terms
of
the
remedy
which
the
law
has
fashioned
for
it,
and
that
is
the
bar
against
systematic
exclusion
of
minorities.
that's
the
evil
which
the
fourteenth
amendment
has
attacked,
the
equal
protection
clause
has
attacked.
that's
the
one
which
this
court
has
dealt
with
and
when
we
talk
about
participation
in
the
deliberative
process,
we
are
saying
that
no
group
should
be
excluded
from
it,
but
we
are
not
saying
--
i
don't
think
that
each
group
has
to
have
a
veto
power
or
can,
simply
by
its
own
will,
frustrate
totally
the
decision
making
process.
and,
the
thought
also
smacks
a
little
bit
of
the
idea,
which
i
don't
like,
that
somehow
a
minority
group
member
on
a
jury
trying
a
minority
group
defendant
are
somehow
the
delegates
or
the
representatives
of
that
man
on
the
jury,
and
i
don't
believe
that
that's
true
on
what
closed
jurors
--
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
right.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
it
does
not
allow
the
jury
to
exclude
them.
it
allows
9
--
10
members
of
the
jury
to
outvote
2
members.
it
requires
the
jury
to
listen
to
the
views
of
each
other
but
as
i
say,
it
goes
to
nobody,
the
veto
power.
it
goes
to
three,
the
power
to
frustrate.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
exactly.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
exactly
right,
they
could,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
complete
and
total
safeguard
against
such
a
situation
which
incidentally
does
not
appear
to
be
the
case
in
any
of
the
cases
--
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
i
say
in
these
cases
before
the
court,
yes.
but,
certainly,
there
are
a
few
rules
that
cannot
be
frustrated
by
men
who
wish
to
frustrate
them
and
you
balance
that
interest,
i
would
think,
against
other
interests
to
be
served
by
the
jury
system.
in
regard
to
the
“beyond
reasonable
doubt,”
the
standard
of
proof
question,
i
want
to
say
that
the
non-unanimous
system
does
not
in
any
way
diminish
the
requisite
standard
of
proof,
contrary
to
counsel's
argument.
beyond
reasonable
doubt
is
but
one
available
standard
of
proof,
it's
the
one
applicable
in
criminal
cases.
there's
also
preponderance
of
evidence.
there's
also
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
and
these
standards
of
proof
in
the
appropriate
cases
are
to
be
applied
by
the
person
or
persons
who
are
authorized
by
law
to
make
the
decision
to
find
the
facts.
in
some
cases,
that's
a
judge,
that
may
be
jurors,
and
may
be
a
proportion
of
the
jurors,
and
in
equity
cases
it
can
be
a
proportion
of
appellate
judges,
majority
of
appellate
judges
or
such
other
person
as
the
law
authorizes
to
apply
the
standard
of
proof
to
the
evidence
before
them.
we
do
not
say,
for
example,
that
it
takes
--
well,
it
is
not
a
function
of
a
number
who
must
concur
the
standard
of
proof
is
not.
we
do
not
say,
for
example,
as
counsel
might
have
suggested,
it
takes
7
out
of
12
to
find
a
preponderance
and
9
out
of
12
to
find
clear
and
convincing
and
12
out
of
12
to
find
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
that
is
a
confusion
of
what
the
standard
of
proof
is,
and
if
we
accepted
the
fact
that
disagreement
between
10
members
of
the
jury
and
2
members
of
the
jury
was
in
fact
due
to
the
existence
of
reasonable
doubt,
then
we
would
have
to
take
such
a
verdict
not
as
a
deadlock
but
as
an
acquittal
and
retrial
would
be
barred.
although,
this
court
has
said
that
in
such
situation
retrial
is
not
double
jeopardy.
williams
versus
florida
established
beyond
doubt
that
the
number
of
the
jurors
who
deliberated
is
not
an
essential
to
the
quality
of
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
counsel
in
that
case
argued
no
doubt
that
you
had
--
that
if
you
had
to
persuade
12
to
achieve
reasonable
doubt,
6
would
be
a
lesser
standard
of
proof.
williams
versus
florida
said
that,
beyond
reasonable
doubt,
the
achievement
of
that
standard
does
not
depend
on
the
number
of
jurors
who
must
find
it,
who
must
apply
the
standard
and
i
say,
similarly,
it
doesn't
control
the
proportion
of
the
number
who
must
concur.
there
is
nothing
magic
about
unanimity.
if
we
had
a
system
wherein
999
out
of
the
thousand
jurors
had
to
concur
in
order
to
achieve
a
verdict,
that
would
be
a
higher
standard
of
persuasion
than
would
be
the
persuasion
of
6
jurors
unanimously.
there
is
nothing
magic
in
unanimity
itself
that
helps
us
achieve
the
proper
standard.
the
requisite
number
and
the
requisite
proportion
of
the
jurors
needed
for
decision
seems
to
me
to
depend
upon
the
function
to
be
served
by
the
fact
finder.
the
--
for
example,
the
constitution
allows
the
trial
of
the
president
for
high
crimes
and
misdemeanors
by,
at
that
time,
18
out
of
26
senators.
that
is
sufficient
for
that
purpose.
williams
versus
florida
states
that
the
purpose
of
the
function
in
jury
is
--
pardon
me,
the
purpose
and
function
of
the
jury
is
several
fold
but
primarily
it
is
to
act
as
a
shield
against
governmental
oppression
by
the
substitution
of
community
judgment
for
official
judgment.
of
course,
that
particular
function
can
be
accomplished
by
majority
--
by
simple
majority
which
i
do
not
propound.
it
speaks
of
the
inner
position
between
the
accused
and
his
accuser
of
the
common
sense
judgment
of
a
group
of
laymen
and
it
was
--
the
reason
was
clear.
the
colonists
did
not
trust
judges.
they
had
experience
with
the
colonial
judges
and
they
didn't
like
it,
and
they
took
that
decision
away
from
them.
and
then,
you
also
find
in
the
literature,
particularly
from
story,
that
it
is
also
to
act
as
a
shield
against
popular
oppression,
and
i
think
there
is
where
the
requisite
number
attaches
and
i
think
this
reflects
to
the
equal
protection
argument
which
your
honors
were
considering,
and
the
question
must
be
what
proportion
is
a
sufficiently
substantial
shield
to
protect
against
that
oppression.
i
don't
know
how
you
can
draw
a
scientific
measurement
to
say
which
line
is
enough,
which
proportion
is
enough,
but
i
think
we
can
say
fairly
that
10
out
of
12
is
sufficient
to
accomplish
that
purpose.
after
there
has
been
a
fair
selection
process
of
a
representative
array,
a
representative
venire
and
after
there
has
been
voir
dire
in
the
process
of
challenge,
it
is
a
high
burden
for
the
district
attorney
to
overcome
to
persuade
10
out
of
12
beyond
reasonable
doubt
to
convict,
and
they
are
not
going
to
do
it
without
substantial
or
clear
evidence
in
front
of
them.
i
think,
for
example,
i
hark
back
to
the
only
such
period
during
my
lifetime,
the
days
when
mccarthy
was
popular
or
was
prevalent
and
i
think
back
to
that
time
and
i
cannot
imagine,
although
most
of
the
abuses
at
that
time
were
legislative
rather
than
judicial,
that
a
jury
of
12
people
so
chosen
would,
without
sufficient
facts
before
them,
be
carried
by
the
tide
of
public
temper
to
come
to
an
unjust
verdict.
10
out
of
12
would
protect
in
that
sort
of
situation.
militants,
today,
against
public
temper
runs
are
acquitted
when
appropriate
in
the
courts
of
oregon
and
convicted
when
appropriate.
there
are
several
other
factors
which
influence
the
size
and
the
requisite
majority
that
are
listed
out
in
williams
and
florida
and
speaks
of
group
deliberation.
there
is
no
way,
as
the
court
pointed
out,
to
compel
deliberation,
you
cannot.
you
can
encourage
it.
the
english
system
of
requiring
those
two
hours
seems
to
me
a
commendable
sort
of
device.
it
doesn't
happen
to
be
in
the
oregon
procedure.
it
is
not
necessary
however,
it
seems
to
me,
to
write
something
into
constitutional
granite
to
freeze
the
majority
system
for
all
time,
particularly
when
the
contrary
is
being
advocated
by
really
the
american
bar
association
project.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
no.
i
draw
no
connection,
your
honor.
i
think
it
is
simply
an
illustration
of
my
proposition
that
the
number
and
the
proportion
among
that
number
which
is
necessary
to
make
a
decision
depends
upon
the
nature
of
the
decision
to
be
made,
the
gravity
of
the
consequences,
and
the
accuracy
which
is
required.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
they
were
indeed,
your
honor,
and
they
were
not
willing
to
write
unanimity
into
the
constitution
in
dealing
with
jury
verdicts.
your
honor,
many
of
the
commentators
note
that
this
is
a
flagrant
exception
to
the
normal
human
--
to
the
normal
civic
means
of
making
decisions.
there
is
no
other
area
in
which
we
require
unanimity
or
at
least
nothing
known.
courts
are
not
required
to
be
unanimous.
legislatures
are
not
required
to
be
unanimous.
they
may
be
required
to
be
representative,
but
not
unanimous.
committees,
corporations,
parliamentary
procedure,
nothing
requires
unanimity
except
jury
verdicts,
and
that's
a
historical
accent
and
that
the
case
for
historical
accent
is
clear
as
mrs.
--
the
lady
from
florida
put
it,
mrs.
korns.
now,
it
stands
out
as
an
exception
among
the
common
law
nations
and
not
all
of
those,
few
of
those.
australia,
interestingly,
has
--
their
constitution
is
modeled
in
our
sixth
amendment,
the
appropriate
portion.
and,
either
all
of
the
provinces
or
dominions
with
maybe
one
exception
have,
at
one
time
or
another,
adopted
non-unanimous
systems.
one
of
the
factors
incidentally,
and
this
was
the
most
important
of
the
english
and
it's
noted
in
williams
versus
florida,
is
that
the
body
must
be
such
as
there
would
be
some
guarantee
of
freedom
against
outside
attempts
and
intimidation.
while
that
is
not
an
immense
problem,
it
is
a
serious
problem
and
it
is
an
increasingly
serious
problem
with
the
growth
and
development
of
organized
crime.
this
case
--
this
court
has
dealt
with
similar
cases
hoffman
(ph)
and,
most
important,
the
court
said
that
the
number
of
jurors
must
relate
to
the
role
of
the
jury
as
fact
finder.
the
goal
of
the
jury
system
is
not
deadlock
in
its
decision,
and
i
--
and
we
argue,
i
think
correctly,
that
the
role
of
fact
finder
is
better
performed
under
the
non-unanimous
system
partly
because
there
are
fewer
mistrials
because
of
deadlock,
but
also
because
it
does
so
with
less
compromise.
we
can
at
least
speculate,
or
you
cannot
prove
it,
that
the
juries
are
more
accurate.
the
verdicts
are
more
accurate.
i
do
not
think
that
the
highest
function
of
the
jury
system
is
to
achieve
obvious
compromise
verdicts,
petty
larceny
convictions
for
theft
of
cadillacs
or
other
such
verdicts.
it
is
to
decide
accurately
and
we
allow
non-unanimity
in
other
situations.
first
of
all,
we
pressure
our
jurors
into
unanimity
and
regardless
of
the
safeguards
around
the
allen
charge,
that's
all
the
allen
charge
is,
is
a
pressure
upon
a
juror
to
come
to
unanimity
in
other
jurisdictions,
we
do
not
in
oregon.
we
do
have
them
go
back
when
they
report
deadlock
so
they
can
come
out
unanimous,
and
jurors
do
come
over
for
all
sorts
of
reasons.
that
is
not
a
necess
--
that
is
not
--
that
is
carefully
guarded
against
in
the
oregon
system.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
williams
versus
--
i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
think
your
reasoning
would
probably
be
equally
applicable
but
it's
not
necessary
for
the
court
to
hold
it
because
williams
versus
florida
seems
to
indicate
that
the
states
will
be
allowed
to
fashion
its
own
system
so
long
as
it
incorporates
functionally
essential
features.
whether
you
wish
to
put
this
--
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
i
--
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
yes.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
correct,
but
i
say
the
standard
i
would
expect
to
be
so.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
i
would
say,
first,
the
sixth
amendment
does
not
apply
because
it
was
stricken
from
the
sixth
amendment.
secondly
--
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
other
--
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
the
sixth
amendment
does
not
require
unanimity
because
the
requirement
of
unanimity
was
struck.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
correct.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
correct.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
correct.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
i
--
well,
your
honor,
distinction
does
not
come
to
mind.
due
process
means
due
process.
there
is
no
distinction
that
comes
to
mind
at
the
moment.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
it
would
remain
in
the
federal
statue,
quite
right,
and
they
would
be
free
to
change.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
well,
it's
supposed
to.
[attempt
to
laughter]
i
am
not
sure
sometimes
what
it
does
mean.
i
do
want
to
say
we
have
other
examples
of
non-unanimity
which
we
allow.
i
point,
for
example,
to
a
common
situation
of
six
jurors
who
agree
on
premeditated
murder
and
six
who
agree
on
felony
murder.
yet,
we
don't
question
if
they
are
not
all
in
agreement.
i
do
think
that
the
system
is
good
because
it
works,
and
i
don't
think
that,
as
a
general
kind
of
matter,
due
process
is
designed
to
forbid
that
which
works
fairly,
that
which
works
expeditiously,
that
which
works
well,
and
this
does
in
oregon.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
that
amendment
was
passed
by
a
vote
of
the
people
of
oregon
in
1934
and
that
was
in
response
to
a
recommendation
of
the
american
law
institute
made
in
1931
and
it
is
proposed
criminal
code
at
that
time
and
so
that
is
the
history
as
recorded
by
crime
commission,
including
a
young
law
professor
named
wayne
morse
who
achieved
some
province
and
also
one
who
reached
rest
of
activities
control
board.
as
a
matter
of
incidental
information.
as
a
preliminary
observation,
i
want
to
point
out
with
also
a
typical
--
back
to
kalven
and
zeisel
that
i
am
not
here
necessarily
defending
some
dialing
of
the
prosecutors
nursery.
i
am
here
to
defend
majority
verdict
system
as
a
good
system
rather
than
to
argue
for
advantage
because
what
it
does
here
it
facilitates
the
end
object
of
trials
that
is
a
verdict.
one
way
or
the
other,
there
is
no
particular
statistic
or
advantage
for
the
prosecution
and
in
fact
the
slight
statistical
advantage
to
the
defense.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
it
is
my
burden
your
honor
to
show
that
it
is
not
violative
of
the
constitution
and
particularly
of
the
sixth
amendment.
i
do
not
think
it
will
hurt
me
to
demonstrate,
this
is
also
a
good
system.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
quite
right
your
honor
and
i
intend
to
speak
to
both
because
council
does
seek
to
broaden
it
to
some
interpretation
of
the
phrase
jury
trial.
so
i
do
wish
to
get
to
it.
kalven
and
zeisel's
figures
incidentally
cannot
be
interpreted
and
i
am
not
going
to
the
detail
to
show
that
a
defendant
would
enjoin
criminal
cases
across
the
board
is
slightly
higher
than
acquittal
rate.
where
10:2
verdicts
generally
allowed
in
the
states.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
no.
i
am
not
speaking
of
retrial.
we
do
generally
retry
cases
in
oregon
but
i
cannot
speak
to
retrial.
furthermore
i
have
pointed
out
just
since
we
are
talking
statistics
that
we
read,
that
we
convict
some
85%
of
the
defendants
in
oregon
county
that
go
to
trial,
94%
altogether.
so
when
speak
about
80-20
break
of
hung
juries
where
guilt
or
acquittal.
even
there
the
defendant
would
enjoy
slighter
advantage
from
the
county
in
which
i
may
incorporate.
we
feel
that
is
a
good
system
10:2.
i
am
not
arguing
for
9:3
one
way
or
the
other
but
the
ali
as
i
say
agreed
with
that
and
their
recommendation
of
1931.
the
english
agreed
with
that
proposition
in
1967
when
they
switched
to
such
a
system
and
the
american
bar
association
project
on
minimum
standards
agree
with
that
as
a
suitable
formal
procedure
for
the
united
states
in
its
report
of
1968
and
even
kalven
and
zeisel
whose
common
carry
is
not
always
on
our
side
of
things.
he
grudgingly
admitted
in
their
law
review
article
in
their
speech
advising
the
english
that
justice
in
oregon
has
not
broken
down
the
court
but
then
also
nobody
has
ever
claimed
that
oregon
justice
is
superior
to
justice
elsewhere.
kalven
and
zeisel
so
state,
the
constitution
does
not
require
that
our
justice
be
superior
to
elsewhere
of
course.
we
find
that
it
does
sort
the
guilty
from
the
not
guilty
and
it
does
it
in
a
fair
manner.
it
does
so
accurately
and
it
does
so
efficiently
and
i
think
that
all
three
of
those
qualities
are
essential.
we
invalidate
the
oregon
system
of
course
and
this
court
must
find
that
in
his
offensive
either
to
the
very
wording
of
the
sixth
amendment
or
it
is
offensive
in
the
sense
which
counsel
suggests
that
the
phrase
jury
trial
precludes
a
majority
verdict
system
and
we
argue
that
neither
is
correct.
it
is
not
violative
of
the
sixth
amendment.
i
wish
to
point
out
that
i
--
counsel
pointed
out
in
there
too
in
my
brief
and
i
wish
to
acknowledge
it
with
my
regrets.
i
start
discussing
article
3
section
2
and
the
constitutional
debates
thereon
quoting
from
the
(inaudible)
and
i
transpose
the
word
in
my
note,
civil
to
criminal
in
my
brief
at
page
19
which
i
regret.
at
the
constitutional
convention
in
oregon
about
civil
cases
only.
when
the
congress
met
to
submit
the
sixth
amendment
however
as
counsel
acknowledged
there,
there
was
specific
reference
to
criminal
cases,
specific
reference
to
unanimous
jury
verdicts
and
james
madison’s
original
formulation,
which
i
would
read.
reads
the
trial
of
all
crimes
ellipse
shall
be
by
an
impartial
jury
of
the
free
holders
of
the
vicinage
with
the
requisite
of
unanimity
for
conviction
of
the
right
of
challenge
and
other
custom
requisites.
that
was
passed,
not
formed
by
the
house,
sent
to
the
senate.
there
in
the
senate,
various
of
the
clauses
including
the
unanimity
clause
were
stricken.
the
diarist
to
the
senate
was
ill
that
day
and
so
we
do
not
have
a
record
of
the
debate.
it
was
sent
back
to
the
house.
there
was
a
motion
in
the
house
to
restore
most
of
that
wording.
the
motion
in
the
house
failed
on
an
even
vote.
so
unanimity
was
stricken
from
the
sixth
amendment
and
this
court
in
order
to
decide
with
the
petitioner
would
essentially
have
to
reinsert
the
language
which
the
congress
struck.
as
to
whether
or
not
under
williams
versus
florida
and
duncan
versus
louisiana,
the
phrase
jury
trial
and
in
and
of
itself
requires
unanimity,
i
think
not
because
it
is
functionally
silent.
the
function
of
jury
as
used
in
that
phrase,
and
define
in
duncan
and
williams,
is
that,
it
was
to
serve
an
interposition,
an
interpositional
safeguard.
interposition
of
the
common
sense
of
the
citizens
as
a
shield
against
an
oppressive
government.
it
was
a
safeguard
inserted
between
citizen
and
crime.
it
stemmed
from
the
distrust
of
the
courts,
which
existed
at
that
period.
it
stemmed
also
i
might
add
there
was
considerable
distrust
from
lawyers
and
also
prosecutors
but
originally
the
crime
was
the
--
of
course,
the
agent
requirement
were
thought
to
be
oppressive
and
that
was
uncertain.
the
unanimity
is
not
necessary
to
perform
the
function
of
safeguard.
surely,
for
example,
if
there
were
a
jury
of
24
and
we
allowed
a
verdict
to
23
to
24.
23
out
of
24,
that
sort
of
a
system
would
safeguard,
the
citizen
from
an
oppressive
government.
it
would
interposition
citizen's
judgment
at
least
equally
effectively
and
a
narrow
requirement
that
six
citizens
sit
in
judgment
of
the
facts.
the
function
according
to
those
cases
and
i
am
sure
correctly
so
is
the
substitution
of
citizen
judgment
for
official
judgment
and
a
verdict
of
10:2
does
just
that.
i
might
point
out
that
for
other
high
crimes
and
treason,
the
constitution
allows
the
fact
finder
to
decide
by
three
quarters
and
i
speak
specifically
of
the
impeachment
proceeding
wherein
at
that
time,
18
to
26
vote
was
sufficient
to
find
the
president
or
a
judge
guilty
as
i
recall
the
phrase.
high
crimes,
and
treason
and
impeachment.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
no
your
honor,
i
would
not.
there
must
be
a
certain
adequacy
to
the
safeguard
it
seems
to
me
and
i
am
not
called
upon
to
defend
the
7:5.
it
must
be
more
than
a
mere
of
majority,
it
would
seem
but
i
say
that
as
a
subjective
judgment.
10:2,
i
would
remind
you,
because
a
5:1
vote.
the
ratio
is
5:1.
7:5
is
barely
a
1:1
ratio.
it
is
only
slightly
more
than
that.
9:3
is
quite
another
matter
somewhere,
there
is
i
think
simply
a
judgmental
determination
to
be
made
and
i
think
that
10:2
at
least
in
my
experience
has
worked
out
satisfactorily
in
oregon
without
public
clamor
to
the
contrary
and
it
is
an
agreement
with
as
i
indicated.
the
american
law
institute,
the
american
bar
association
project
and
the
english
in
1830,
there
was
a
recommendation
of
a
royal
commission
in
england
that
they
switched
to
a
9:3
or
an
8:4
system
but
it
went
nowhere.
generally
nothing
is--
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
that
could
be.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
this
depends
on
how
the
jury
chooses
to
operate
your
honor.
there
is
a
tendency
among
juries’
desire
to
be
unanimous
but
that
is
something
i
cannot
prove
or
anything
that
i
cannot
cite
or
study.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
they
are
empowered
your
honor
to
return
their
verdict
at
that
time.
similarly
--
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
they
are
empowered
equally,
to
where
they
voted
12:0
to
return
without
deliberation.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
well,
i
am
saying
it
would
be
within
their
power
not
to
listen
to
the
two.
not
to
deliberate,
not
to
discuss
it
if
that
were
the
vote,
and
i
must
say
–
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
it
would
be
authorized,
yes
indeed,
because
in
that
case
one
side
or
the
other,
the
state
of
the
defendant
has
persuaded
ten
men
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
well,
of
course
that
would
not
be
permissible,
i
am
not
trying
to
debate
the
alternatives
your
honor
but
to
discuss
what
we
have.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
under
williams,
of
course
six
would
insufficient.
i
might
add
incidentally
that
we
have
used
six
man
jurors
in
our
lower
courts.
six-man
juries
is
there
required
to
be
unanimous.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
no,
there
is
not
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
there
is
not.
there
is
not
and
i
think
wisely
not
because
unanimity
is
more
desirable
as
the
number
is
reduced.
because
we
are
talking
about
a
safeguard
function.
if
the
juries
were
composed
of
40
men
and
obviously
unanimity
would
not
be
as
important
as
it
is,
if
it
is
composed
of
six
men
because
we
are
talking
about
a
substantial
barrier
between
government
and
citizen
and
six
unanimous
will
perform
it.
ten
agreed
beyond
reasonable
doubt
will
perform
that
function.
i
wish
to
say
also
that
in
that
case,
unanimity
is
often
compelled
and
by
that
i
mean
12
people
are
seldom
unanimous
in
any
view.
we
tend
to
be
contentious
and
that
is
particularly
true
as
we
have
broadened
the
representation
in
the
jury
and
the
law
has
many
devices
to
make
for
unanimity
where
truly,
there
is
not.
we
do
not
anymore,
as
they
did
at
common
law,
freeze
or
starve
the
jurors
or
cart
them
from
a
size
to
a
size
until
they
decide.
what
we
do,
allow
our
judges
to
comment
on
the
evidence
and
according
to
kalven
and
ziesel’s
review
of
a
101
cases
where
the
judge
did
comment
on
the
evidence,
only
one
jury
failed
to
agree
with
the
judge
and
that
failed
only
by
an
11:1
vote.
so
that
is
a
powerful
weapon
to
compel
unanimity
or
influence
unanimity.
the
allen
charge
pushes
a
jury
to
unanimity
often
not;
i
would
not
say
that,
in
oregon
at
the
time
of
the
original
argument,
our
supreme
court
had
not
ruled
on
the
allen
charge.
since
then,
our
supreme
court
has
disallowed
the
allen
charge
in
oregon.
we
do
not
allow
our
judges
to
comment
on
the
evidence
but
that
is
what
those
devices
are
for.
we
do
not
happen
to
employ
those.
there
are
structural
devices
within
the
criminal
law,
which
are
designed
largely
to
encourage
compromise
and
if
not
designed
for
it,
although
that
is
a
principle
of
code
revision.
if
not
designed
for
it
that
is
there
effect.
graves
of
crimes,
we
have
those
in
oregon.
jury
set
penalties
or
such
devices
to
encourage
compromise
rather
than
really
the
vote
of
conviction
and
this
court
authorized
that
last
may.
even
in
a
single
non-bifurcated
proceeding
like
mcgartha
versus
california
and
crampton
versus
ohio.
we
do
not
have
those
devices
in
oregon.
we
do
have
attended
to
a
verdict,
which
i
think
reflects
much
more
accurately
the
feelings
of
those
jurors.
the
last
two
that
come
over
and
the
last
one
that
came
over
most
likely
for
a
speculative
recourse.
because
of
all
sorts
of
pressures
and
all
sort
of
things.
but
i
think
that
a
10:2
verdict
has
certainly
the
same
degree
of
integrity
behind
it
and
has
certainly
the
same
strength
as
a
safeguard
between
citizen
and
government,
as
does
to
a
verdict
where
there
is
a
judges
commentary
on
the
evidence
which
means
evaluation
of
it
and
in
allen
charge
and
a
compromise
regarding
penalty,
none
of
which
we
allow.
and
i
might
add,
it
does
it
first
time
around.
it
has
a
positive
value
in
the
administration
of
justice
and
i
think
that
is
important
today.
the
aclu
amicus
brief
refered
to
the
savings
and
mistrials
as
being
a
trifling
economy;
it
is
much
more
than
a
trifling
economy.
and
actually,
there
is
a
picture
congestion
in
the
courts.
in
oregon,
we
believe
that
justice
need
not
be
harsh
but
it
should
be
swift.
kalven
and
zeisel
states
there
are
5.6%
mistrials
in
unanimous
states
3.1%
is
all
for
mistrials
in
oregon
and
louisiana.
i
do
not
know
what
the
break
down
would
be.
a
difference
of
2.5%
but
the
difference
in
other
words
of
81%
if
we
were
to
switch
to
the
unanimous
system,
it
would
increase
our
mistrial
by
81%,
we
have
managed
in
(inaudible)
county
to
get
trial
down
to
within
60
days
of
arrest.
we
have
gotten
the
appellate
process
down
in
the
last
two
and
a
half
years,
for
18
months
to
four
and
a
half
months
and
we
have
done
it
by
examining
each
article
of
criminal
procedure
to
try
and
better
the
system.
we
do
not
need
an
81%
increase
in
mistrials
and
i
think
that
we
do
more
–
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
but
i
do
not
think
that
that
your
honor
will
perform
this
safeguard
function
because
as
the
jury
was
designed
for
and
that
is
why
i
am
not
arguing
for
a
majority.
plaintiff
argues--
pardon
me.
petitioner
argues
four
arguments.
he
has
a
burden
of
proof
beyond
reasonable
doubt
argument.
he
argues
for
meaningful
deliberation,
for
a
cross
section
of
community
and
for
public
competence
and
i
will
answer
those
arguments.
the
burden
of
proof
does
not
affect.
the
standard
of
proof
beyond
reasonable
doubt
is
not
affected
by
a
non-unanimous
jury
system.
the
burden
of
proof
stays
with
the
government
except
for
all
–
except
for
affirmative
defenses.
the
burden
of
persuasion
stays
with
the
government
except
for
all
affirmative
defenses.
beyond
reasonable
doubt
remains
the
standard
for
whomever
it
is
that
the
law
authorizes
to
find
the
facts
and
that
is
not
coordinative
numbers.
that
maybe
12
jurors,
6
jurors
while
one
judge.
or
ten
out
of
twelve
jurors.
the
doubt
of
one
juror
is
not
reasonable
doubt.
else
wise
is
a
hang
jury
would
be
a
finding
of
reasonable
doubt.
that
would
be
upheld
as
an
acquittal
and
this
court
authorize
retrials
in
such
situations
back
in
1902
and
to
carry
his
argument,
(inaudible)
demonstrate
that
the
beyond
reasonable
doubt
argument
is
not
applicable.
we
could
say
by
extending
his
argument
that
a
rule
allowing
a
seven-man
verdict
for
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
a
nine-man
verdict
for
clear
and
convincing
the
evidence
and
a
12-man
verdict
for
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
it
could
be
with
a
logical
outcome
of
an
argument,
which
tends
to
be
the
standard
of
proof
to
the
numbers.
it
does
not;
those
are
not
relevant
considerations,
burden
of
proof
or
burden
of
persuasion
in
examining
that
majority
verdict.
regarding
the
requirement
of
meaningful
deliberation,
there
are
cases
in
which
deliberation
will
be
meaningful
and
i
suspect
that
there
are
cases
today
in
which
deliberation
is
not
meaningful.
for
example,
the
one
where
they
decide
12-0
one-way
or
another
at
the
very
beginning
on
the
initial
vote.
there
are
however
less
banned
constitutional
solutions
to
accomplish
that
particular
goal
if
the
court
deems
it
desirably.
that
is
i
think
of
the
minimum
deliberation
time
as
in
england.
which,
we
do
not
have.
certainly,
that
seems
to
me
rather
an
instinct
device
and
probably
a
very
good
one.
and
i
might
add
incidentally
that
there
is
a
directive
of
court
as
is
the
practice
in
england
wherein
the
trial
courts
are
directed
not
to
instruct
the
juries
even
regarding
the
possibility
of
a
majority
verdict
until
they
have
deliberated
for
two
hours
and
reported
back
which
is
an
interesting
device.
the
point
i
wish
to
make
however
is,
that
it
is
not
something,
which
is
constitutional
proportional,
which
must
be
dealt
with
by
carving
something
new
into
the
grant
of
constitution.
there
is
no
need
for,
it
can
be
dealt
with
simpler
remedies
if
there
is
an
indication
somewhere
that
there
is
less
than
meaningful
deliberation
and
you
never
know.
i
tried
a
murder
case
ones,
which
moved
trying
up
with
a
second-degree
verdict.
10:2,
and
found
out
afterwards
that
the
two
holdouts
were
for
first-degree
murder.
one
really
never
knows
even
exactly
what
the
verdict
means.
regarding
the
cross
section
of
the
community,
that
is
a
problem
of
the
panel
rather
than
being
specific,
not
rather
than
a
specific
jury
has
been
pointed
out.
swain
versus
alabama
and
the
allowance
of
the
peremptory
strike
system
demonstrates
the
difficulties
of
translating
that
down
to
the
specific
jury,
that
tries
a
case
but
in
any
rate,
in
williams,
it
says
that
less
than
twelve
men,
six
men
are
sufficient
to
bring
out
of
such
a
sampling,
a
fair
sampling
into
the
jury
room
is
sufficient
to
place
a
body
of
citizenry
between
crown
and
citizen,
which
is
the
purpose
of
the
jury.
i
do
not
think
that
the
demand
for
cross
section
means
that
anyone
--
it
means
that
all
should
participate,
it
does
mean
that
all
should
participate
not
necessarily
that
each
should
have
veto
or
each
should
be
able
to
prohibit
decision.
the
goal
of
trial
unlike
some
of
the
insertions
of
defendants
brief
is
swain,
it
seems
to
me
always
to
be
verdict
and
not
a
mistrial
and
a
demand
for
mistrials
is
really
demand
for
veto
not
for
discussion.
if
minority
members
are
in
fact
excluded,
and
i
have
a
chance
to
answer
questions,
which
were
asked
to
me
last
march.
it
is
rare
that
a
lawyer
can
give
the
answer,
after
he
sits
down
but
anyway,
if
members
are
arbitrarily
excluded
from
the
deliberations
of
a
case,
it
seems
to
me
that
is
not,
the
likely
kind
of
abuse
that
you
would
assume,
juries
will
commit.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
if
there
is
such
an
impropriety,
such
an
abuse,
that
is
something,
which
we
remedy
after
when
it
comes
to
life
and
such
things,
do
come
to
life.
there
is
a
motion
for
new
trial.
there
is
post
conviction
relief.
and
in
oregon,
we
provide
all
the
due
process
counsel,
transcripts,
and
etcetera.
there
is
a
federal
habeas
corpus,
as
a
remedy
where
such
a
matter
occurs,
parker
versus
gladden
as
you
may
recall
out
of
oregon
and
not
two
years
ago,
such
an
example
where
the
bailiff
sent
to
the
jury,
that
wicked
fellow,
he
was
surely
guilty
of
words
to
that
affect.
we
did
not
eliminate
bailiffs
as
a
result
of
such
an
abuse.
we
kept
bailiffs
but
we
do
provide
the
after
the
fact
remedy
in
that
case
for
the
habeas
corpus.
so,
regarding
public
confidence,
it
is
significant
that
the
requirement
of
unanimity
is
an
historical
accident
and
really
nothing
more.
i
will
not
repeat
which
has
been
set
out
in
brief.
it
is
an
historical
accident,
it
just
occurred
and
we
have
it
when
people
have
grown
accustomed
to
it
and
i
would
expect
that
lawyers
from
jurisdiction
are
accustomed
to
unanimity,
have
a
hard
time
adjusting
to
some
other
system
mentally,
their
initial
response
is
barely
negative
although
we
have
grown
very
comfortable.
but
non-unanimity
on
the
other
hand
when
we
talk
of
public
confidence
was
specifically
voted
in
by
the
people
of
the
state
of
oregon.
when
they
amended
the
constitution
and
so
when
we
speak
of
public
confidence,
we
must
remember
that
this
came
from
the
public.
the
public
did
decide
and
it
does
not
simply
lawyers
have
self
appointed
withered
aims
of
public
opinion.
this
was
a
public
measure
and
there
is
no
ground
as
well
i
can
report
of
opinions,
and
it
is
trying
to
change
here.
we
are
undergoing
procedural
revision
at
this
very
time
and
there
is
no
movement
within
that
body
to
change
it
because
it
works
and
i
think
that
is
the
last
point
that
i
wish
to
reemphasize,
it
does
work,
it
was
accurately
fairly
expeditiously
and
it
did
in
these
cases.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
not
repeat
mrs.
korns'
history.
i
found
it
accurate
and
detailed
in
the
brief,
and
mr.
sobol
has
stated
this
case
fairly.
i
would
like
to
say
at
the
outset
that
i
am
defending
the
non-unanimous
jury
verdict
system
not
only
because
we
have
three
cases,
three
convictions,
at
bar
and
several
others
stacked
up
as
certiorari
--
petitions
for
certiorari
pending,
but
because
it
is
a
good
system
and
it
works
and
it
is
to
be
defended.
as
mr.
justice
stewart
indicated
in
his
questioning,
it
is
a
two-way
street.
it
is
not
simply
another
darling
of
the
prosecutor's
nursery.
people
are
acquitted
in
the
same
manner
that
people
are
convicted
by
10-2
verdicts
in
situations
which,
in
another
state,
would
result
in
a
hung
verdict
--
a
hung
jury
and
a
retrial.
and,
to
take
just
a
moment
with
mr.
kalven
&
zeisel,
before
moving
on,
i
do
want
to
dispute
one
thing
and
these
also
were
asked
about.
in
regard
to
the
ultimate
deadlock
statistics
that
they
set
out,
out
of
the
cases
they
have
studied,
they
show
42
cases
deadlocked
at
10-2.
34
of
them,
that's
1%,
were
deadlocked
with
convicting
majorities.
19%
were
convicted
--
were
deadlocked
with
acquitting
majorities
and
in
--
where
i
come
from,
in
multnomah
county,
the
conviction
rate
is
85%.
that
figure
where
those
cases
allowed
to
go
to
10-2
verdicts
would
have
been
favorable
to
the
defendant,
not
to
the
state,
by
an
insignificant
percentage.
and,
in
cases
of
initial
voting,
they
sampled
156
cases
and
of
those,
none,
which
began
at
11-1,
were
hung.
those
which
went
with
initial
votes
of
2
or
3
to
convict
were
hung.
there
were
7%
of
those
hung,
and
the
reverse
situation
there
were
none
hung.
so,
again,
those
are
juries
likely
to
convict
--
pardon
me,
likely
to
acquit
where
7%
were
hung.
so,
even
on
that
statistic,
this
system
--
it
would
seem,
according
to
those
figures,
are
favorable
to
the
defendant
and
not
to
the
state.
i'm
here
to
defend
it
because
oregon
believes
it
to
be
a
good
system
and
the
american
law
institute
agreed
with
that
in
1931
when
it
recommended
it
and
substantially
the
form
which
oregon
adopted,
as
well
as
an
oregon
commission
which
had
many
distinguished
members
including
the
senator
to
be,
wayne
morse.
the
english
adopted
the
same
system,
somewhat
modified,
requiring
a
minimum
deliberation
time
in
1967.
the
american
bar
association
project
on
minimum
standards
of
criminal
justice
have
approved
--
that's
the
wrong
word,
endorsed
the
system
for
us
in
the
american
states
and
a
very
extinguished
panel
both
on
the
groups
which
drafted
the
report
and
the
general
project
committee
headed
by
judge
lombard
which
approved
it
in
1968,
and
i'm
speaking,
therefore,
of
the
approved
draft
and
not
the
tentative
draft.
in
oregon,
as
sort
of
a
lab
model
in
the
federal
system,
has
shown
that
it
works
and
the
experience
in
oregon
has
been
that
it
seems
to
sort
the
innocent
from
the
guilty
and
it
does
it
in
a
way
which
is
fair
and
which
is
accurate
and
which
is
expeditious
and
that's
what
the
criminal
justice
system
is
suppose
to
do.
there
is
no
cry
of
injustice
which
i
am
aware.
there
are
theoretical
objections
raised,
such
as
mr.
sobol's,
but
no
one
has
claimed
injustice,
most
certainly
no
more
so
than
in
states
which
require
unanimity.
kalven
and
zeisel,
in
an
article
--
in
a
subsequent
article
which
they
wrote
as
sort
of
an
advisory
article
to
the
british
who
were
considering
the
criminal
justice
act
of
1967,
recommended
against
adoption
of
that
act,
but
they
also
acknowledged
that
the
oregon
system
works.
it
achieves
justice
fairly.
there's
no
breakdown
of
justice
in
oregon,
and
there
is
no
breakdown
and
no
cry
of
injustice
in
these
cases
either.
two
of
the
defendants
in
the
cases
before
the
court
took
the
stand
and
admitted
guilt.
one
admitted
complicity,
the
other
one
admitted
guilt
and
asked
for
sympathy
and,
in
the
third
case,
he
was
convicted
on
the
basis
of
a
voluntary
confession
and
he
did
not
present
a
case
or,
in
any
way,
deny
it.
they
were
out,
granted,
for
periods
of
under
an
hour,
but
no
jury
faced
with
those
facts
could
or
should
have
acquitted.
those
would've
been
miscarriages
of
justice.
i
do
want
to
briefly
mention
history
which
has
already
been
discussed.
the
senate
did
delete
the
unanimity
requirement
of
the
sixth
amendment.
the
house
failed
to
restore
it.
the
reason
is
clear.
it
is
not
as
mr.
sobol
suggests
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
detail
the
procedure
because
that
was
understood
as
a
part
of
the
amendment.
rather,
we
get
the
history
from
madison's
letter
at
the
time,
which
is
referred
to
in
williams
versus
florida
and
which
i
refer
to
in
the
brief.
we
get
the
similar
history
of
article
iii,
section
2
from
the
federalist
no.
83.
the
reason
it
was
not
included
was
because
the
practice
of
the
states
at
the
time
was
diverse,
and
therefore,
there
was
not
the
inclination
to
lock
all
the
states
into
one
uniform
system
and,
as
the
chief
justice
has
pointed
out,
4
--
at
least
4
of,
which
i'm
aware,
of
the
colonies,
north
carolina
may
have
changed
by
then,
did
practice
non-unanimous
systems
and
that's
4
out
of
13.
new
york
had
a
strange
system
which
the
federalist
refers
to,
where
there
was
an
appeal
as
a
matter
of
right
from
one
jury
to
another
until
somebody
had
2
out
of
3
verdicts,
which
is
essentially
a
24
out
of
36
vote,
two-thirds
vote.
so,
the
practice
was
not
uniform
and
that
is
the
reason
it
was
not
locked
in.
counsel
suggests,
i
think
incorrectly,
that
this
court
write
into
the
sixth
amendment
what
the
senate
or
the
framers
took
out.
the
federal
unanimity,
incidentally,
is
statutory,
at
least
in
my
view.
i
point
out
in
my
brief
at
page
19
that
the
effort
at
the
convention
to
insert
in
article
iii,
section
2
the
language
“and
a
trial
by
jury
shall
be
preserved
as
usual
in
criminal
cases”
was
defeated
and
the
constitutional
conventions
of
eliot's
debates
shows
it
and,
again,
the
argument
was
there's
no
such
thing
as
“as
usual”
at
this
point
of
history
in
the
american
colonies.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
i
can't
tell
you,
your
honor.
i
didn't
research
it
because
it
wasn't
an
issue,
but
i
think
we
can
say
that
it
does
not
come
from
the
constitution
and
since
they
all
do
it,
i
would
expect
--
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
pardon
me?
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
i
don't
know.
i
think
that's
precisely
my
point
though,
your
honor.
it
is
a
legislative
determination
and
not
a
constitutional
one.
i
do
not
--
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
it
most
certainly
has,
your
honor,
in
several
cases.
however,
in
none
of
those
cases
was
unanimity
truly
an
issue.
there
are
a
few
such
as
the
hawaiian
case,
mankichi,
where
unanimity
was
an
issue
but
the
court
sidestepped
the
constitutionality
of
it.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
that's
correct.
same
with
utah,
but
it
was
never
actually
the
issue
of
any
case.
it
was
never
actually
the
issue
which
had
been
resolved.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
you
indicated
in
williams
that
the
question
was
open
and
there
was
some
statement
in
williams
also
that
the
court
reserves
the
right
to
change
its
mind
about
the
sixth
amendment
and,
that,
of
course
is
our
fear.
in
duncan,
the
court
spoke
--
actually
the
historical
argument
would
seem
to
me
--
the
history
of
the
sixth
amendment
would
seem
to
me
to
be
the
end
of
the
issue
in
terms
of
unanimity.
however,
i
wish
to
follow
counsel's
argument
into
other
constitutional
areas.
it's
clear
under
duncan,
given
what
the
english
had
done
and
what
is
the
practice
in
this
country
that
it
is
not
--
unanimity
is
not
an
essential
part
of
the
anglo-american
regime
of
ordered
liberty,
which
was
referred
to
in
the
case.
counsel's
--
the
most
troublesome
problem
i
think
that
counsel
raises
is
the
--
and
the
one
that's
mentioned
in
footnote
46
of
williams
is
the
idea,
which
i
think
to
be
a
false
idea,
that
the
requirement
or
that
the
allowance
of
non-unanimous
verdicts
somehow
reduces
the
standard
of
proof
beyond
reasonable
doubt,
and
i'd
like
to
talk
to
that
point
at
some
length
because
the
other
points
are
not
nearly
as
complex.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
i
will
right
now,
your
honor.
such
a
thing
obviously
can't
happen.
there's
nothing
to
compel
any
jury
to
act
with
integrity.
it
cannot,
but
the
equal
protection
clause
--
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
it
could
happen.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
no,
i
don't
think
--
no,
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
the
oregon
system
also
instructs
jurors
to
listen
to
the
arguments
of
their
other
fellow
jurors
and
to
deliberate.
it
would
be
the
corrupt
jury
which
just
says
“i
do
not
need
to
listen
to
you.
go
wait
in
the
corner,”
but
--
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
yes,
i'm
not
sure
that
that
would
be
an
effective
remedy,
in
all
candor
though,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
if
somebody
is
--
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
certainly,
but
i
think
the
equal
protection
argument
has
to
be
answered
in
terms
of
the
remedy
which
the
law
has
fashioned
for
it,
and
that
is
the
bar
against
systematic
exclusion
of
minorities.
that's
the
evil
which
the
fourteenth
amendment
has
attacked,
the
equal
protection
clause
has
attacked.
that's
the
one
which
this
court
has
dealt
with
and
when
we
talk
about
participation
in
the
deliberative
process,
we
are
saying
that
no
group
should
be
excluded
from
it,
but
we
are
not
saying
--
i
don't
think
that
each
group
has
to
have
a
veto
power
or
can,
simply
by
its
own
will,
frustrate
totally
the
decision
making
process.
and,
the
thought
also
smacks
a
little
bit
of
the
idea,
which
i
don't
like,
that
somehow
a
minority
group
member
on
a
jury
trying
a
minority
group
defendant
are
somehow
the
delegates
or
the
representatives
of
that
man
on
the
jury,
and
i
don't
believe
that
that's
true
on
what
closed
jurors
--
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
right.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
it
does
not
allow
the
jury
to
exclude
them.
it
allows
9
--
10
members
of
the
jury
to
outvote
2
members.
it
requires
the
jury
to
listen
to
the
views
of
each
other
but
as
i
say,
it
goes
to
nobody,
the
veto
power.
it
goes
to
three,
the
power
to
frustrate.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
exactly.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
exactly
right,
they
could,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
complete
and
total
safeguard
against
such
a
situation
which
incidentally
does
not
appear
to
be
the
case
in
any
of
the
cases
--
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
i
say
in
these
cases
before
the
court,
yes.
but,
certainly,
there
are
a
few
rules
that
cannot
be
frustrated
by
men
who
wish
to
frustrate
them
and
you
balance
that
interest,
i
would
think,
against
other
interests
to
be
served
by
the
jury
system.
in
regard
to
the
“beyond
reasonable
doubt,”
the
standard
of
proof
question,
i
want
to
say
that
the
non-unanimous
system
does
not
in
any
way
diminish
the
requisite
standard
of
proof,
contrary
to
counsel's
argument.
beyond
reasonable
doubt
is
but
one
available
standard
of
proof,
it's
the
one
applicable
in
criminal
cases.
there's
also
preponderance
of
evidence.
there's
also
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
and
these
standards
of
proof
in
the
appropriate
cases
are
to
be
applied
by
the
person
or
persons
who
are
authorized
by
law
to
make
the
decision
to
find
the
facts.
in
some
cases,
that's
a
judge,
that
may
be
jurors,
and
may
be
a
proportion
of
the
jurors,
and
in
equity
cases
it
can
be
a
proportion
of
appellate
judges,
majority
of
appellate
judges
or
such
other
person
as
the
law
authorizes
to
apply
the
standard
of
proof
to
the
evidence
before
them.
we
do
not
say,
for
example,
that
it
takes
--
well,
it
is
not
a
function
of
a
number
who
must
concur
the
standard
of
proof
is
not.
we
do
not
say,
for
example,
as
counsel
might
have
suggested,
it
takes
7
out
of
12
to
find
a
preponderance
and
9
out
of
12
to
find
clear
and
convincing
and
12
out
of
12
to
find
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
that
is
a
confusion
of
what
the
standard
of
proof
is,
and
if
we
accepted
the
fact
that
disagreement
between
10
members
of
the
jury
and
2
members
of
the
jury
was
in
fact
due
to
the
existence
of
reasonable
doubt,
then
we
would
have
to
take
such
a
verdict
not
as
a
deadlock
but
as
an
acquittal
and
retrial
would
be
barred.
although,
this
court
has
said
that
in
such
situation
retrial
is
not
double
jeopardy.
williams
versus
florida
established
beyond
doubt
that
the
number
of
the
jurors
who
deliberated
is
not
an
essential
to
the
quality
of
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
counsel
in
that
case
argued
no
doubt
that
you
had
--
that
if
you
had
to
persuade
12
to
achieve
reasonable
doubt,
6
would
be
a
lesser
standard
of
proof.
williams
versus
florida
said
that,
beyond
reasonable
doubt,
the
achievement
of
that
standard
does
not
depend
on
the
number
of
jurors
who
must
find
it,
who
must
apply
the
standard
and
i
say,
similarly,
it
doesn't
control
the
proportion
of
the
number
who
must
concur.
there
is
nothing
magic
about
unanimity.
if
we
had
a
system
wherein
999
out
of
the
thousand
jurors
had
to
concur
in
order
to
achieve
a
verdict,
that
would
be
a
higher
standard
of
persuasion
than
would
be
the
persuasion
of
6
jurors
unanimously.
there
is
nothing
magic
in
unanimity
itself
that
helps
us
achieve
the
proper
standard.
the
requisite
number
and
the
requisite
proportion
of
the
jurors
needed
for
decision
seems
to
me
to
depend
upon
the
function
to
be
served
by
the
fact
finder.
the
--
for
example,
the
constitution
allows
the
trial
of
the
president
for
high
crimes
and
misdemeanors
by,
at
that
time,
18
out
of
26
senators.
that
is
sufficient
for
that
purpose.
williams
versus
florida
states
that
the
purpose
of
the
function
in
jury
is
--
pardon
me,
the
purpose
and
function
of
the
jury
is
several
fold
but
primarily
it
is
to
act
as
a
shield
against
governmental
oppression
by
the
substitution
of
community
judgment
for
official
judgment.
of
course,
that
particular
function
can
be
accomplished
by
majority
--
by
simple
majority
which
i
do
not
propound.
it
speaks
of
the
inner
position
between
the
accused
and
his
accuser
of
the
common
sense
judgment
of
a
group
of
laymen
and
it
was
--
the
reason
was
clear.
the
colonists
did
not
trust
judges.
they
had
experience
with
the
colonial
judges
and
they
didn't
like
it,
and
they
took
that
decision
away
from
them.
and
then,
you
also
find
in
the
literature,
particularly
from
story,
that
it
is
also
to
act
as
a
shield
against
popular
oppression,
and
i
think
there
is
where
the
requisite
number
attaches
and
i
think
this
reflects
to
the
equal
protection
argument
which
your
honors
were
considering,
and
the
question
must
be
what
proportion
is
a
sufficiently
substantial
shield
to
protect
against
that
oppression.
i
don't
know
how
you
can
draw
a
scientific
measurement
to
say
which
line
is
enough,
which
proportion
is
enough,
but
i
think
we
can
say
fairly
that
10
out
of
12
is
sufficient
to
accomplish
that
purpose.
after
there
has
been
a
fair
selection
process
of
a
representative
array,
a
representative
venire
and
after
there
has
been
voir
dire
in
the
process
of
challenge,
it
is
a
high
burden
for
the
district
attorney
to
overcome
to
persuade
10
out
of
12
beyond
reasonable
doubt
to
convict,
and
they
are
not
going
to
do
it
without
substantial
or
clear
evidence
in
front
of
them.
i
think,
for
example,
i
hark
back
to
the
only
such
period
during
my
lifetime,
the
days
when
mccarthy
was
popular
or
was
prevalent
and
i
think
back
to
that
time
and
i
cannot
imagine,
although
most
of
the
abuses
at
that
time
were
legislative
rather
than
judicial,
that
a
jury
of
12
people
so
chosen
would,
without
sufficient
facts
before
them,
be
carried
by
the
tide
of
public
temper
to
come
to
an
unjust
verdict.
10
out
of
12
would
protect
in
that
sort
of
situation.
militants,
today,
against
public
temper
runs
are
acquitted
when
appropriate
in
the
courts
of
oregon
and
convicted
when
appropriate.
there
are
several
other
factors
which
influence
the
size
and
the
requisite
majority
that
are
listed
out
in
williams
and
florida
and
speaks
of
group
deliberation.
there
is
no
way,
as
the
court
pointed
out,
to
compel
deliberation,
you
cannot.
you
can
encourage
it.
the
english
system
of
requiring
those
two
hours
seems
to
me
a
commendable
sort
of
device.
it
doesn't
happen
to
be
in
the
oregon
procedure.
it
is
not
necessary
however,
it
seems
to
me,
to
write
something
into
constitutional
granite
to
freeze
the
majority
system
for
all
time,
particularly
when
the
contrary
is
being
advocated
by
really
the
american
bar
association
project.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
no.
i
draw
no
connection,
your
honor.
i
think
it
is
simply
an
illustration
of
my
proposition
that
the
number
and
the
proportion
among
that
number
which
is
necessary
to
make
a
decision
depends
upon
the
nature
of
the
decision
to
be
made,
the
gravity
of
the
consequences,
and
the
accuracy
which
is
required.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
they
were
indeed,
your
honor,
and
they
were
not
willing
to
write
unanimity
into
the
constitution
in
dealing
with
jury
verdicts.
your
honor,
many
of
the
commentators
note
that
this
is
a
flagrant
exception
to
the
normal
human
--
to
the
normal
civic
means
of
making
decisions.
there
is
no
other
area
in
which
we
require
unanimity
or
at
least
nothing
known.
courts
are
not
required
to
be
unanimous.
legislatures
are
not
required
to
be
unanimous.
they
may
be
required
to
be
representative,
but
not
unanimous.
committees,
corporations,
parliamentary
procedure,
nothing
requires
unanimity
except
jury
verdicts,
and
that's
a
historical
accent
and
that
the
case
for
historical
accent
is
clear
as
mrs.
--
the
lady
from
florida
put
it,
mrs.
korns.
now,
it
stands
out
as
an
exception
among
the
common
law
nations
and
not
all
of
those,
few
of
those.
australia,
interestingly,
has
--
their
constitution
is
modeled
in
our
sixth
amendment,
the
appropriate
portion.
and,
either
all
of
the
provinces
or
dominions
with
maybe
one
exception
have,
at
one
time
or
another,
adopted
non-unanimous
systems.
one
of
the
factors
incidentally,
and
this
was
the
most
important
of
the
english
and
it's
noted
in
williams
versus
florida,
is
that
the
body
must
be
such
as
there
would
be
some
guarantee
of
freedom
against
outside
attempts
and
intimidation.
while
that
is
not
an
immense
problem,
it
is
a
serious
problem
and
it
is
an
increasingly
serious
problem
with
the
growth
and
development
of
organized
crime.
this
case
--
this
court
has
dealt
with
similar
cases
hoffman
(ph)
and,
most
important,
the
court
said
that
the
number
of
jurors
must
relate
to
the
role
of
the
jury
as
fact
finder.
the
goal
of
the
jury
system
is
not
deadlock
in
its
decision,
and
i
--
and
we
argue,
i
think
correctly,
that
the
role
of
fact
finder
is
better
performed
under
the
non-unanimous
system
partly
because
there
are
fewer
mistrials
because
of
deadlock,
but
also
because
it
does
so
with
less
compromise.
we
can
at
least
speculate,
or
you
cannot
prove
it,
that
the
juries
are
more
accurate.
the
verdicts
are
more
accurate.
i
do
not
think
that
the
highest
function
of
the
jury
system
is
to
achieve
obvious
compromise
verdicts,
petty
larceny
convictions
for
theft
of
cadillacs
or
other
such
verdicts.
it
is
to
decide
accurately
and
we
allow
non-unanimity
in
other
situations.
first
of
all,
we
pressure
our
jurors
into
unanimity
and
regardless
of
the
safeguards
around
the
allen
charge,
that's
all
the
allen
charge
is,
is
a
pressure
upon
a
juror
to
come
to
unanimity
in
other
jurisdictions,
we
do
not
in
oregon.
we
do
have
them
go
back
when
they
report
deadlock
so
they
can
come
out
unanimous,
and
jurors
do
come
over
for
all
sorts
of
reasons.
that
is
not
a
necess
--
that
is
not
--
that
is
carefully
guarded
against
in
the
oregon
system.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
williams
versus
--
i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
think
your
reasoning
would
probably
be
equally
applicable
but
it's
not
necessary
for
the
court
to
hold
it
because
williams
versus
florida
seems
to
indicate
that
the
states
will
be
allowed
to
fashion
its
own
system
so
long
as
it
incorporates
functionally
essential
features.
whether
you
wish
to
put
this
--
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
i
--
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
yes.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
correct,
but
i
say
the
standard
i
would
expect
to
be
so.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
i
would
say,
first,
the
sixth
amendment
does
not
apply
because
it
was
stricken
from
the
sixth
amendment.
secondly
--
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
other
--
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
the
sixth
amendment
does
not
require
unanimity
because
the
requirement
of
unanimity
was
struck.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
correct.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
correct.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
correct.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
i
--
well,
your
honor,
distinction
does
not
come
to
mind.
due
process
means
due
process.
there
is
no
distinction
that
comes
to
mind
at
the
moment.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
it
would
remain
in
the
federal
statue,
quite
right,
and
they
would
be
free
to
change.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
well,
it's
supposed
to.
[attempt
to
laughter]
i
am
not
sure
sometimes
what
it
does
mean.
i
do
want
to
say
we
have
other
examples
of
non-unanimity
which
we
allow.
i
point,
for
example,
to
a
common
situation
of
six
jurors
who
agree
on
premeditated
murder
and
six
who
agree
on
felony
murder.
yet,
we
don't
question
if
they
are
not
all
in
agreement.
i
do
think
that
the
system
is
good
because
it
works,
and
i
don't
think
that,
as
a
general
kind
of
matter,
due
process
is
designed
to
forbid
that
which
works
fairly,
that
which
works
expeditiously,
that
which
works
well,
and
this
does
in
oregon.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
that
amendment
was
passed
by
a
vote
of
the
people
of
oregon
in
1934
and
that
was
in
response
to
a
recommendation
of
the
american
law
institute
made
in
1931
and
it
is
proposed
criminal
code
at
that
time
and
so
that
is
the
history
as
recorded
by
crime
commission,
including
a
young
law
professor
named
wayne
morse
who
achieved
some
province
and
also
one
who
reached
rest
of
activities
control
board.
as
a
matter
of
incidental
information.
as
a
preliminary
observation,
i
want
to
point
out
with
also
a
typical
--
back
to
kalven
and
zeisel
that
i
am
not
here
necessarily
defending
some
dialing
of
the
prosecutors
nursery.
i
am
here
to
defend
majority
verdict
system
as
a
good
system
rather
than
to
argue
for
advantage
because
what
it
does
here
it
facilitates
the
end
object
of
trials
that
is
a
verdict.
one
way
or
the
other,
there
is
no
particular
statistic
or
advantage
for
the
prosecution
and
in
fact
the
slight
statistical
advantage
to
the
defense.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
it
is
my
burden
your
honor
to
show
that
it
is
not
violative
of
the
constitution
and
particularly
of
the
sixth
amendment.
i
do
not
think
it
will
hurt
me
to
demonstrate,
this
is
also
a
good
system.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
quite
right
your
honor
and
i
intend
to
speak
to
both
because
council
does
seek
to
broaden
it
to
some
interpretation
of
the
phrase
jury
trial.
so
i
do
wish
to
get
to
it.
kalven
and
zeisel's
figures
incidentally
cannot
be
interpreted
and
i
am
not
going
to
the
detail
to
show
that
a
defendant
would
enjoin
criminal
cases
across
the
board
is
slightly
higher
than
acquittal
rate.
where
10:2
verdicts
generally
allowed
in
the
states.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
no.
i
am
not
speaking
of
retrial.
we
do
generally
retry
cases
in
oregon
but
i
cannot
speak
to
retrial.
furthermore
i
have
pointed
out
just
since
we
are
talking
statistics
that
we
read,
that
we
convict
some
85%
of
the
defendants
in
oregon
county
that
go
to
trial,
94%
altogether.
so
when
speak
about
80-20
break
of
hung
juries
where
guilt
or
acquittal.
even
there
the
defendant
would
enjoy
slighter
advantage
from
the
county
in
which
i
may
incorporate.
we
feel
that
is
a
good
system
10:2.
i
am
not
arguing
for
9:3
one
way
or
the
other
but
the
ali
as
i
say
agreed
with
that
and
their
recommendation
of
1931.
the
english
agreed
with
that
proposition
in
1967
when
they
switched
to
such
a
system
and
the
american
bar
association
project
on
minimum
standards
agree
with
that
as
a
suitable
formal
procedure
for
the
united
states
in
its
report
of
1968
and
even
kalven
and
zeisel
whose
common
carry
is
not
always
on
our
side
of
things.
he
grudgingly
admitted
in
their
law
review
article
in
their
speech
advising
the
english
that
justice
in
oregon
has
not
broken
down
the
court
but
then
also
nobody
has
ever
claimed
that
oregon
justice
is
superior
to
justice
elsewhere.
kalven
and
zeisel
so
state,
the
constitution
does
not
require
that
our
justice
be
superior
to
elsewhere
of
course.
we
find
that
it
does
sort
the
guilty
from
the
not
guilty
and
it
does
it
in
a
fair
manner.
it
does
so
accurately
and
it
does
so
efficiently
and
i
think
that
all
three
of
those
qualities
are
essential.
we
invalidate
the
oregon
system
of
course
and
this
court
must
find
that
in
his
offensive
either
to
the
very
wording
of
the
sixth
amendment
or
it
is
offensive
in
the
sense
which
counsel
suggests
that
the
phrase
jury
trial
precludes
a
majority
verdict
system
and
we
argue
that
neither
is
correct.
it
is
not
violative
of
the
sixth
amendment.
i
wish
to
point
out
that
i
--
counsel
pointed
out
in
there
too
in
my
brief
and
i
wish
to
acknowledge
it
with
my
regrets.
i
start
discussing
article
3
section
2
and
the
constitutional
debates
thereon
quoting
from
the
(inaudible)
and
i
transpose
the
word
in
my
note,
civil
to
criminal
in
my
brief
at
page
19
which
i
regret.
at
the
constitutional
convention
in
oregon
about
civil
cases
only.
when
the
congress
met
to
submit
the
sixth
amendment
however
as
counsel
acknowledged
there,
there
was
specific
reference
to
criminal
cases,
specific
reference
to
unanimous
jury
verdicts
and
james
madison’s
original
formulation,
which
i
would
read.
reads
the
trial
of
all
crimes
ellipse
shall
be
by
an
impartial
jury
of
the
free
holders
of
the
vicinage
with
the
requisite
of
unanimity
for
conviction
of
the
right
of
challenge
and
other
custom
requisites.
that
was
passed,
not
formed
by
the
house,
sent
to
the
senate.
there
in
the
senate,
various
of
the
clauses
including
the
unanimity
clause
were
stricken.
the
diarist
to
the
senate
was
ill
that
day
and
so
we
do
not
have
a
record
of
the
debate.
it
was
sent
back
to
the
house.
there
was
a
motion
in
the
house
to
restore
most
of
that
wording.
the
motion
in
the
house
failed
on
an
even
vote.
so
unanimity
was
stricken
from
the
sixth
amendment
and
this
court
in
order
to
decide
with
the
petitioner
would
essentially
have
to
reinsert
the
language
which
the
congress
struck.
as
to
whether
or
not
under
williams
versus
florida
and
duncan
versus
louisiana,
the
phrase
jury
trial
and
in
and
of
itself
requires
unanimity,
i
think
not
because
it
is
functionally
silent.
the
function
of
jury
as
used
in
that
phrase,
and
define
in
duncan
and
williams,
is
that,
it
was
to
serve
an
interposition,
an
interpositional
safeguard.
interposition
of
the
common
sense
of
the
citizens
as
a
shield
against
an
oppressive
government.
it
was
a
safeguard
inserted
between
citizen
and
crime.
it
stemmed
from
the
distrust
of
the
courts,
which
existed
at
that
period.
it
stemmed
also
i
might
add
there
was
considerable
distrust
from
lawyers
and
also
prosecutors
but
originally
the
crime
was
the
--
of
course,
the
agent
requirement
were
thought
to
be
oppressive
and
that
was
uncertain.
the
unanimity
is
not
necessary
to
perform
the
function
of
safeguard.
surely,
for
example,
if
there
were
a
jury
of
24
and
we
allowed
a
verdict
to
23
to
24.
23
out
of
24,
that
sort
of
a
system
would
safeguard,
the
citizen
from
an
oppressive
government.
it
would
interposition
citizen's
judgment
at
least
equally
effectively
and
a
narrow
requirement
that
six
citizens
sit
in
judgment
of
the
facts.
the
function
according
to
those
cases
and
i
am
sure
correctly
so
is
the
substitution
of
citizen
judgment
for
official
judgment
and
a
verdict
of
10:2
does
just
that.
i
might
point
out
that
for
other
high
crimes
and
treason,
the
constitution
allows
the
fact
finder
to
decide
by
three
quarters
and
i
speak
specifically
of
the
impeachment
proceeding
wherein
at
that
time,
18
to
26
vote
was
sufficient
to
find
the
president
or
a
judge
guilty
as
i
recall
the
phrase.
high
crimes,
and
treason
and
impeachment.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
no
your
honor,
i
would
not.
there
must
be
a
certain
adequacy
to
the
safeguard
it
seems
to
me
and
i
am
not
called
upon
to
defend
the
7:5.
it
must
be
more
than
a
mere
of
majority,
it
would
seem
but
i
say
that
as
a
subjective
judgment.
10:2,
i
would
remind
you,
because
a
5:1
vote.
the
ratio
is
5:1.
7:5
is
barely
a
1:1
ratio.
it
is
only
slightly
more
than
that.
9:3
is
quite
another
matter
somewhere,
there
is
i
think
simply
a
judgmental
determination
to
be
made
and
i
think
that
10:2
at
least
in
my
experience
has
worked
out
satisfactorily
in
oregon
without
public
clamor
to
the
contrary
and
it
is
an
agreement
with
as
i
indicated.
the
american
law
institute,
the
american
bar
association
project
and
the
english
in
1830,
there
was
a
recommendation
of
a
royal
commission
in
england
that
they
switched
to
a
9:3
or
an
8:4
system
but
it
went
nowhere.
generally
nothing
is--
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
that
could
be.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
this
depends
on
how
the
jury
chooses
to
operate
your
honor.
there
is
a
tendency
among
juries’
desire
to
be
unanimous
but
that
is
something
i
cannot
prove
or
anything
that
i
cannot
cite
or
study.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
they
are
empowered
your
honor
to
return
their
verdict
at
that
time.
similarly
--
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
they
are
empowered
equally,
to
where
they
voted
12:0
to
return
without
deliberation.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
well,
i
am
saying
it
would
be
within
their
power
not
to
listen
to
the
two.
not
to
deliberate,
not
to
discuss
it
if
that
were
the
vote,
and
i
must
say
–
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
it
would
be
authorized,
yes
indeed,
because
in
that
case
one
side
or
the
other,
the
state
of
the
defendant
has
persuaded
ten
men
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
well,
of
course
that
would
not
be
permissible,
i
am
not
trying
to
debate
the
alternatives
your
honor
but
to
discuss
what
we
have.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
under
williams,
of
course
six
would
insufficient.
i
might
add
incidentally
that
we
have
used
six
man
jurors
in
our
lower
courts.
six-man
juries
is
there
required
to
be
unanimous.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
no,
there
is
not
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
there
is
not.
there
is
not
and
i
think
wisely
not
because
unanimity
is
more
desirable
as
the
number
is
reduced.
because
we
are
talking
about
a
safeguard
function.
if
the
juries
were
composed
of
40
men
and
obviously
unanimity
would
not
be
as
important
as
it
is,
if
it
is
composed
of
six
men
because
we
are
talking
about
a
substantial
barrier
between
government
and
citizen
and
six
unanimous
will
perform
it.
ten
agreed
beyond
reasonable
doubt
will
perform
that
function.
i
wish
to
say
also
that
in
that
case,
unanimity
is
often
compelled
and
by
that
i
mean
12
people
are
seldom
unanimous
in
any
view.
we
tend
to
be
contentious
and
that
is
particularly
true
as
we
have
broadened
the
representation
in
the
jury
and
the
law
has
many
devices
to
make
for
unanimity
where
truly,
there
is
not.
we
do
not
anymore,
as
they
did
at
common
law,
freeze
or
starve
the
jurors
or
cart
them
from
a
size
to
a
size
until
they
decide.
what
we
do,
allow
our
judges
to
comment
on
the
evidence
and
according
to
kalven
and
ziesel’s
review
of
a
101
cases
where
the
judge
did
comment
on
the
evidence,
only
one
jury
failed
to
agree
with
the
judge
and
that
failed
only
by
an
11:1
vote.
so
that
is

or

unanimity.
the
allen
charge
pushes
a
jury
to
unanimity
often
not;
i
would
not
say
that,
in
oregon
at
the
time
of
the
original
argument,
our
supreme
court
had
not
ruled
on
the
allen
charge.
since
then,
our
supreme
court
has
disallowed
the
allen
charge
in
oregon.
we
do
not
allow
our
judges
to
comment
on
the
evidence
but
that
is
what
those
devices
are
for.
we
do
not
happen
to
employ
those.
there
are
structural
devices
within
the
criminal
law,
which
are
designed
largely
to
encourage
compromise
and
if
not
designed
for
it,
although
that
is
a
principle
of
code
revision.

jury
set
penalties
or
such
devices
to
encourage
compromise
rather
than
really
the
vote
of
conviction
and
this
court
authorized
that
last
may.
even
in
a
single
non-bifurcated
proceeding
like
mcgartha
versus
california
and
crampton
versus
ohio.
we
do
not
have
those
devices
in
oregon.
we
do
have
attended
to
a
verdict,
which
i
think
reflects
much
more
accurately
the
feelings
of
those
jurors.
the
last
two
that
come
over
and
the
last
one
that
came
over
most
likely
for
a
speculative
recourse.
because
of
all
sorts
of
pressures
and
all
sort
of
things.
but
i
think
that
a
10:2
verdict
has
certainly
the
same
degree
of
integrity
behind
it
and
has
certainly
the
same
strength
as
a
safeguard
between
citizen
and
government,
as
does
to
a
verdict
where
there
is
a
judges
commentary
on
the
evidence
which
means
evaluation
of
it
and
in
allen
charge
and
a
compromise
regarding
penalty,
none
of
which
we
allow.
and
i
might
add,
it
does
it
first
time
around.
it
has
a
positive
value
in
the
administration
of
justice
and
i
think
that
is
important
today.
the
aclu
amicus
brief
refered
to
the
savings
and
mistrials
as
being
a
trifling
economy;
it
is
much
more
than
a
trifling
economy.
and
actually,
there
is
a
picture
congestion
in
the
courts.
in
oregon,
we
believe
that
justice
need
not
be
harsh
but
it
should
be
swift.
kalven
and
zeisel
states
there
are
5.6%
mistrials
in
unanimous
states
3.1%
is
all
for
mistrials
in
oregon
and
louisiana.
i
do
not
know
what
the
break
down
would
be.
a
difference
of
2.5%
but
the
difference
in
other
words
of
81%
if
we
were
to
switch
to
the
unanimous
system,
it
would
increase
our
mistrial
by
81%,
we
have
managed
in
(inaudible)
county
to
get
trial
down
to
within
60
days
of
arrest.
we
have
gotten
the
appellate
process
down
in
the
last
two
and
a
half
years,
for
18
months
to
four
and
a
half
months
and
we
have
done
it
by
examining
each
article
of
criminal
procedure
to
try
and
better
the
system.
we
do
not
need
an
81%
increase
in
mistrials
and
i
think
that
we
do
more
–
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
but
i
do
not
think
that
that
your
honor
will
perform
this
safeguard
function
because
as
the
jury
was
designed
for
and
that
is
why
i
am
not
arguing
for
a
majority.
plaintiff
argues--
pardon
me.
petitioner
argues
four
arguments.
he
has
a
burden
of
proof
beyond
reasonable
doubt
argument.
he
argues
for
meaningful
deliberation,
for
a
cross
section
of
community
and
for
public
competence
and
i
will
answer
those
arguments.
the
burden
of
proof
does
not
affect.
the
standard
of
proof
beyond
reasonable
doubt
is
not
affected
by
a
non-unanimous
jury
system.
the
burden
of
proof
stays
with
the
government
except
for
all
–
except
for
affirmative
defenses.
the
burden
of
persuasion
stays
with
the
government
except
for
all
affirmative
defenses.
beyond
reasonable
doubt
remains
the
standard
for
whomever
it
is
that
the
law
authorizes
to
find
the
facts
and
that
is
not
coordinative
numbers.
that
maybe
12
jurors,
6
jurors
while
one

or
ten
out
of
twelve
jurors.
the
doubt
of
one
juror
is
not
reasonable
doubt.
else
wise
is
a
hang
jury
would
be
a
finding
of
reasonable
doubt.
that
would
be
upheld
as
an
acquittal
and
this
court
authorize
retrials
in
such
situations
back
in
1902
and
to
carry
his
argument,
(inaudible)
demonstrate
that
the
beyond
reasonable
doubt
argument
is
not
applicable.
we
could
say
by
extending
his
argument
that
a
rule
allowing
a
seven-man
verdict
for
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
a
nine-man
verdict
for
clear
and
convincing
the
evidence
and
a
12-man
verdict
for
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
it
could
be
with
a
logical
outcome
of
an
argument,
which
tends
to
be
the
standard
of
proof
to
the
numbers.
it
does
not;
those
are
not
relevant
considerations,
burden
of
proof
or
burden
of
persuasion
in
examining
that
majority
verdict.
regarding
the
requirement
of
meaningful
deliberation,
there
are
cases
in
which
deliberation
will
be
meaningful
and
i
suspect
that
there
are
cases
today
in
which
deliberation
is
not
meaningful.
for
example,
the
one
where
they
decide
12-0
one-way
or
another
at
the
very
beginning
on
the
initial
vote.
there
are
however
less
banned
constitutional
solutions
to
accomplish
that
particular
goal
if
the
court
deems
it
desirably.
that
is
i
think
of
the
minimum
deliberation
time
as
in
england.
which,
we
do
not
have.
certainly,
that
seems
to
me
rather
an
instinct
device
and
probably
a
very
good
one.
and
i
might
add
incidentally
that
there
is
a
directive
of
court
as
is
the
practice
in
england
wherein
the
trial
courts
are
directed
not
to
instruct
the
juries
even
regarding
the
possibility
of
a
majority
verdict
until
they
have
deliberated
for
two
hours
and
reported
back
which
is
an
interesting
device.
the
point
i
wish
to
make
however
is,
that
it
is
not
something,
which
is
constitutional
proportional,
which
must
be
dealt
with
by
carving
something
new
into
the
grant
of
constitution.
there
is
no
need
for,
it
can
be
dealt
with
simpler
remedies
if
there
is
an
indication
somewhere
that
there
is
less
than
meaningful
deliberation
and
you
never
know.
i
tried
a
murder
case
ones,
which
moved
trying
up
with
a
second-degree
verdict.
10:2,
and
found
out
afterwards
that
the
two
holdouts
were
for
first-degree
murder.
one
really
never
knows
even
exactly
what
the
verdict
means.
regarding
the
cross
section
of
the
community,
that
is
a
problem
of
the
panel
rather
than
being
specific,
not
rather
than
a
specific
jury
has
been
pointed
out.
swain
versus
alabama
and
the
allowance
of
the
peremptory
strike
system
demonstrates
the
difficulties
of
translating
that
down
to
the
specific
jury,
that
tries
a
case
but
in
any
rate,
in
williams,
it
says
that
less
than
twelve
men,
six
men
are
sufficient
to
bring
out
of
such
a
sampling,
a
fair
sampling
into
the
jury
room
is
sufficient
to
place
a
body
of
citizenry
between
crown
and
citizen,
which
is
the
purpose
of
the
jury.
i
do
not
think
that
the
demand
for
cross
section
means
that
anyone
--
it
means
that
all
should
participate,
it
does
mean
that
all
should
participate
not
necessarily
that
each
should
have
veto
or
each
should
be
able
to
prohibit
decision.
the
goal
of
trial
unlike
some
of
the
insertions
of
defendants
brief
is
swain,
it
seems
to
me
always
to
be
verdict
and
not
a
mistrial
and
a
demand
for
mistrials
is
really
demand
for
veto
not
for
discussion.
if
minority
members
are
in
fact
excluded,
and
i
have
a
chance
to
answer
questions,
which
were
asked
to
me
last
march.
it
is
rare
that
a
lawyer
can
give
the
answer,
after
he
sits
down
but
anyway,
if
members
are
arbitrarily
excluded
from
the
deliberations
of
a
case,
it
seems
to
me
that
is
not,
the
likely
kind
of
abuse
that
you
would
assume,
juries
will
commit.
mr.
jacob
b.
tanzer
if
there
is
such
an
impropriety,
such
an
abuse,
that
is
something,
which
we
remedy
after
when
it
comes
to
life
and
such
things,
do
come
to
life.
there
is
a
motion
for
new
trial.
there
is
post
conviction
relief.
and
in
oregon,
we
provide
all
the
due
process
counsel,
transcripts,
and
etcetera.
there
is
a
federal
habeas
corpus,
as
a
remedy
where
such
a
matter
occurs,
parker
versus
gladden
as
you
may
recall
out
of
oregon
and
not
two
years
ago,
such
an
example
where
the
bailiff
sent
to
the
jury,
that
wicked
fellow,
he
was
surely
guilty
of
words
to
that
affect.
we
did
not
eliminate
bailiffs
as
a
result
of
such
an
abuse.
we
kept
bailiffs
but
we
do
provide
the
after
the
fact
remedy
in
that
case
for
the
habeas
corpus.
so,
regarding
public
confidence,
it
is
significant
that
the
requirement
of
unanimity
is
an
historical
accident
and
really
nothing
more.
i
will
not
repeat
which
has
been
set
out
in
brief.
it
is
an
historical
accident,
it
just
occurred
and
we
have
it
when
people
have
grown
accustomed
to
it
and
i
would
expect
that
lawyers
from
jurisdiction
are
accustomed
to
unanimity,
have
a
hard
time
adjusting
to
some
other
system
mentally,
their
initial
response
is
barely
negative
although
we
have
grown
very
comfortable.
but
non-unanimity
on
the
other
hand
when
we
talk
of
public
confidence
was
specifically
voted
in
by
the
people
of
the
state
of
oregon.
when
they
amended
the
constitution
and
so
when
we
speak
of
public
confidence,
we
must
remember
that
this
came
from
the
public.
the
public
did
decide
and
it
does
not
simply
lawyers
have
self
appointed
withered
aims
of
public
opinion.
this
was
a
public
measure
and
there
is
no
ground
as
well
i
can
report
of
opinions,
and
it
is
trying
to
change
here.
we
are
undergoing
procedural
revision
at
this
very
time
and
there
is
no
movement
within
that
body
to
change
it
because
it
works
and
i
think
that
is
the
last
point
that
i
wish
to
reemphasize,
it
does
work,
it
was
accurately
fairly
expeditiously
and
it
did
in
these
cases.
