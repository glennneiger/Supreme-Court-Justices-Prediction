mr.
richard
b.
sobol
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
1968,
this
court
decided
duncan
against
louisiana
in
which
it
held
for
the
first
time
that
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
trial
by
jury
is
applicable
to
criminal
trials
of
state
court
by
virtue
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
a
month
later
in
destefano
against
woods,
the
court
held
that
the
holding
in
duncan
would
only
be
applied
to
cases
tried
after
the
date
of
the
decision
in
duncan.
after
duncan,
the
three
petitioners
in
these
cases
were
tried
in
circuit
courts
of
oregon
for
serious
crimes
and
each
of
them
were
convicted
by
a
split
verdict
under
the
procedure
authorized
by
the
oregon
constitution
of
allowing
a
criminal
verdict
with
10
out
of
12
juries
concurring.
the
votes
in
the
respective
cases
were
11:1
and
two
of
them
in
10:2
in
the
third.
the
jury
in
each
of
these
three
cases
was
out
of
the
courtroom
in
the
jury
room
for
less
than
an
hour
in
one
case
for
less
than
a
half
an
hour.
the
convictions
were
appealed
to
the
oregon
court
of
appeals
raising
the
argument
that
the
sixth
amendment
rights
annunciated
by
duncan
had
been
violated
by
the
acceptance
of
a
split
jury
verdict
and
the
court
of
appeals
of
oregon
following
a
very
recent
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
affirmed
the
convictions
and
held
that
the
sixth
amendment
does
not
guarantee
the
right
to
a
unanimous
jury
verdict.
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
refused
review
of
the
cases
and
the
cases
that
here
on
certiorari
to
this
court.
the
question
therefore,
which
is
presented
in
light
of
duncan
and
destefano
against
woods,
is
whether
the
sixth
amendment
permits
a
conviction
for
serious
crime
without
a
unanimous
jury
verdict
and
i
would
like,
to
in
light
of
the
arguments
made
with
the
state
of
oregon,
define
that
question
even
further
and
that
is
where
there
is
no
state
procedure
for
minimum
periods
of
deliberation,
which
is
the
case
here,
whether
the
sixth
amendment
permits
a
conviction
of
a
serious
crime
without
a
unanimous
jury
verdict.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
i
think
it
would
be
a
different
case.
my
personal
view
on
it
was
that,
it
would
still
not
be
satisfactory
but
the
reference
in
the
state's
brief
to
the
english
system
on
the
proposal
of
the
american
bar
association
are
systems
and
proposals
which
as
part
of
them
secure
a
minimum
period
of
deliberation.
the
draftsmen
in
both
those
cases
recognize
what
we
think
is
a
very
important
value
lost
by
the
oregon
system
of
requiring
jury
deliberation
and
i
think
when
and
if
that
case
ever
gets
here,
the
court
would
have
different
question.
if
another
provision
is
made
to
ensure
deliberation,
whether
or
not
that
insurance
is
satisfactory.
now
in
1970,
in
williams
against
florida,
the
court
passed
on
the
question
of
the
six
man
juries
in
florida.
and
the
court
held
that
although
there
had
been
a
six
manned
jury
historically
at
common
law
and
although
the
court
in
past
have
indicated
that
the
sixth
amendment
does
in
fact
require,
i
am
sorry
there
had
been
a
twelve
man
jury
at
common
law
and
although
the
court,
this
court
had
indicated
in
the
past,
the
twelve
juries
are
required
under
the
sixth
amendment
and
reconsidering
the
question,
the
court
made
a
two-step
analysis.
first,
it
said
that
the
history
of
the
constitution,
the
history
of
the
sixth
amendment
left
the
question
open.
that
it
was
impossible
to
tell
from
the
historical
materials
what
the
draftsman
of
the
sixth
amendment
meant
on
this
point.
and
mr.
justice
white
for
the
court
said,
the
way
we
are
going
to
determine
which
feature
of
jury
trial
right
at
common
law
is
incorporated
in
the
sixth
amendment
is
to
determine
whether
the
feature
in
question
serves
an
important
purpose
in
terms
of
the
functioning
of
the
jury
system.
it
is
a
practical
test
to
be
applied.
applying
that
test,
the
court
held
twelve
men
are
not
required
and
specifically
left
open
with
the
question
of
whether
a
unanimous
jury
verdict
is
required.
now,
we
are
arguing
this
case
squarely
within
the
holding
and
the
test
annunciated
in
williams,
and
we
think
the
application
of
this
test
resolves
the
case
in
our
favor,
because
the
requirement
of
a
unanimous
jury
verdict
serves
four
very
important
purposes
in
terms
of
the
basic
function
of
the
jury
process.
those
four
purposes
are,
it
ensures
that
the
jury
enters
into
meaningful
deliberation.
we
think
it
serves
an
important
purpose
in
maintaining
the
reasonable
doubts
stated
in
criminal
trials.
we
think
it
maintains
an
important
purpose
in
giving
meaning
and
effect
to
this
court's
decision,
requiring
it
of
a
cross
section
of
the
community
jury
decisions
and
we
think
it
serves
an
important
function
in
terms
of
community.
we
respect
in
confidence
in
the
processes
of
the
criminal
law
and
in
convictions
for
the
secured
criminal
cases.
and
i
would
like
to
discuss
each
of
these
four
functions
to
indicate
their
breadth.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir.
they
are
constitutional
in
this
sense,
interpreting
the
sixth
amendment
in
williams
against
florida.
this
court
said
that
the
way
to
resolve
the
constitutional
and
to
the
issue
of
constitutional
interpretation
in
the
sixth
amendment,
what
does
jury
mean?
it
means
something
and
the
court
said
in
terms
of
deciding
what
it
means,
we
are
going
to
look
to
it,
the
functional
importance
of
the
requisite
of
a
jury
trial
on
issue
here.
that
was
the
sixth
amendment
test
enunciated
by
mr.
justice
white
for
the
court.
we
are
simply
taking
that
test
and
arguing
this
case
that
unlike
any
fixed
number
of
juries,
the
requirement
of
unanimity
is
a
concept
which
serves
very
important
functions
and
therefore
meets
the
constitutional
test
enunciated
by
the
court.
in
1896,
allen
against
united
states,
this
court
said
the
very
object
of
the
jury
system
is
to
secure
unanimity
by
comparison
of
use
and
by
arguments
among
jurors
themselves.
the
unanimity
requirement
is
the
aspect
of
the
jury
trial
system
which
ensures
that
the
jurors
will
go
into
the
jury
room
and
exchange
views.
the
work
that
has
been
jogged
down
in
the
jury
area
by
kalven
and
zeisel
indicate
that
in
states
such
as
oregon
and
louisiana,
the
two
states
that
have
split
verdicts.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
allen
was
a
federal
case
your
honor.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
i
think
in
allen,
the
court
was
talking
about
the
jury
system
constitutionally.
it
was
a
case
having
to
do
with
a
choice
of
the
jury
trial
and
did
not
raise
this
issue.
i
am
just
indicating
that
in
allen,
the
court
was
referring
to
the
operation
of
the
system
and
what
was
important
functional.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
there
was
an
amendment
in
the
house
to
include
unanimity
as
the
specific
requirement
of
the
sixth
amendment.
that
amendment
was
unsuccessful
in
analyzing
that
exact
amendment
in
williams.
the
court
said
that
it
is
not
possible
to
determine
whether
the
unanimity
requirement,
along
with
the
other
aspects
of
that
amendment
was
stricken
because
everybody
knew
the
jury
trial
meant
unanimity
or
because
the
congress
did
not
wanted
it.
and
in
approaching
this
case
your
honor,
we
have
simply
accepted
the
very
recent
interpretation
of
that
very
legislative
history
in
williams
and
accepted
that
conclusion
that
it
is
6
of
one
half
dozen
that
the
other,
it
is
impossible
to
determine
from
that
with
legislative
history
what
exactly
the
framers
had
in
mind.
i
would
point
out
that
the
major
controversy
concerning
that
amendment
did
not
have
to
do
in
any
respect
with
the
requirement
of
unanimity.
the
main
argument
about
the
amendment
was
a
proposal
to
put
vicinage
in
the
sixth
amendment,
to
require
that
a
specific
district
as
a
common
law
be
incorporated
in
the
constitution.
the
debate
was
about
that
point
as
the
journals
of
the
constitution
reflected
so
on
in
our
brief
and
that
the
amendment
was
deleted
with
respect
to
that
issue.
the
whole
of
amendment
was
deleted
but
that
the
controversy,
that
the
congress
was
focusing
on
was
the
vicinage
requirement
which
was
not
a
desired
to
be
included
and
with
that,
the
entire
subsection
was
deleted.
analyzing
that
as
i
said
in
williams,
the
court
said
you
really
cannot
tell
what
the
congress
meant
in
its
drafting
and
that
again,
the
question
has
to
be
decided
in
terms
of
whether
the
issue,
the
requisite
is
functional
in
terms
of
the
jury
system.
now,
the
unanimity
requirement
means
that
the
jury
cannot
come
out
of
the
jury
room
until
everybody
agrees,
and
because
everybody
has
to
agree,
the
process
means
that
everyone
sits
out
at
the
table
and
hears
the
views
of
all
the
juries
and
this
is
important
because,
the
idea
of
having
more
than
one
juror
is
that
different
jurors
are
going
to
see
the
questions
differently
and
are
going
to
have
different
perceptions
of
the
evidence
and
the
reason
that
a
jury
verdict
is
a
fine
a
thing
as
it
is
that
if
everybody’s
view
of
the
evidence,
everybody’s
interpretation
has
been
merged,
has
been
handed
out,
has
been
considered
by
everybody,
so
that
when
the
jury
comes
out
of
the
jury
box
in
the
jury
room
and
announces
its
verdict,
you
have
a
collective
judgement
which
is
considering
the
views
of
everybody.
now
–
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
no
sir.
i
am
saying
that
when
in
this
country,
you
talk
about
juries.
its
intrinsic
meaning
means
unanimity
that
the
jury
system
does
not
function
as
we
know
it
without
unanimity
and
mr.
justice
white
in
williams
said
that
is
the
question
the
court
must
ask
when
it
is
up
for
consideration,
whether
a
particular
feature
is
included
in
the
sixth
amendment.
i
am
simply
taking
up
that
test
and
saying
that
without
deliberation,
you
do
not
have
a
jury
as
we
know
it
in
this
country
that
the
--
as
the
court
said,
the
very
object
of
a
system
is
to
secure
unanimity
by
a
comparison
abuse
and
by
an
arguments
among
jurors.
now
in
–
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
well,
i
think
no.
it
would
not
apply.
i
think
that
there
are,
as
the
courts
recognized
innumerably
are
the
case
like
in
re
winship
comes
to
mind.
there
are
certain
interests
at
stake
in
a
criminal
trial
by
which
the
society
has
historically
wanted
to
be
very
careful
about
erroneous
convictions.
the
risk
of
error
in
terms
of
a
criminal
conviction
has
historically
been
thought
in
this
country
to
be
a
much
more
serious
matter
than
the
risk
of
error
in
a
civil
case
that
enumerable
procedures
have
been
established
in
criminal
cases
to
lessen
the
risk
of
error
in
fact
finding
which
is
always
present.
now,
i
think
the
absence
of
unanimity
certainly
increases
the
risk
of
error
and
the
risk
of
an
erroneous
conviction
and
i
think
that
the
consideration,
the
stakes
in
civil
cases
are
very,
are
different
and
a
very
important
spec.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
well,
your
honor
personally,
i
think
that
there
should
be
no
time
limit,
there
should
be
no
procedure
whereby
the
majority
can
simply
sit
out
the
minority.
but
i
do,
very
firmly
want
to
indicate
to
the
court
that
i
think
that
is
a
very
different
case
and
i
do
not
think
oregon
can
defend
its
procedure
in
this
court
by
saying
well,
in
england;
there
is
a
minimum
period
deliberation.
a
minimum
period
deliberation
is
undoubtedly
a
step
toward
retaining
this
feature
of
the
jury
system.
in
states
like
oregon,
when
the
jury
goes
into
the
jury
room
and
takes
its
first
vote.
if
they
voted
10:2,
there
is
no
discussion.
they
return
to
the
jury
room
and
announce
that
verdict.
if
the
vote
is
8:4
and
after
an
hour
it
turns
to
10:2,
there
is
no
further
consideration
of
the
minority
viewpoint.
now,
in
these
cases,
the
juries
all
out
a
matter,
minutes
and
i
think
that
whatever
maybe
the
ultimate
decision
where
a
state
adopts
a
minimum
period
of
deliberation
system
as
they
have
in
england
and
at
the
american
bar
association
has
recommended,
it
certainly
has
no
relevance
in
defending
the
constitutionality
of
this
system
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
well,
they
would
have
been
a
12
man
jury
which
would
have
conceited
the
evidence.
which
would
have
deliberated
and
which
would
have
reached
a
verdict
and
i
think
the
first
jury
would
not
be
relevant.
in
my
view,
if
there
was
a
24-man
jury
together
and
22
voted.
yes,
i
guess
i
would
make
the
same
argument.
i
think
that
there
is
an
important
value
of
the
jury
system
in
hearing
what
the
different
view
points
are.
that
is
why
you
have
more
than
one
jury,
more
than
one
juror
because
people
see
things
differently.
that
is
one
of
the
basic
human
lessons
and
you
want
to
give
what
everybody
has
to
say.
that
is
what
a
jury
system
is
and
i
think
if
you
were
to
exclude
that
in
the
process
and
in
the
jury
room,
i
would
make
the
same
argument
regardless
of
the
number.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
certainly.
a
lot
depends
on
the
luck
of
the
draw,
but
once
it
is
drawn,
the
system
is
to
hear
what
everybody
has
to
say
before
a
vote
in
written
at
the
very
least
and
i
say
more
than
that
to
work
it
out
so
if
you
do
have
a
unanimous
collective
judgement.
now,
my
second
contention
with
respect
to
what
the
function
of
unanimity
is,
has
to
do
with
reasonable
doubt
as
the
court
knows
in
winship,
it
indicated
the
reasonable
doubt
stands
as
constitutionally
required.
now,
reasonable
doubt
was
developed
in
the
context
of
a
unanimous
jury
verdict.
what
it
means
that
a
prosecutor
has
to
convince
every
juror
to
convict
this
man
and
specifically
what
that
means
is
the
juror
with
the
highest
standard,
the
most
doubting
juror
must
be
convicted.
i
think
it
is
beyond
argument
that
when
you
say
the
prosecutor
needs
to
only
convince
less
than
all
the
juries,
that
he
needs
–
that
a
lesser
burden
of
proof
is
being
put
on
the
state.
the
convictions
on
less
evidence,
conviction
without
convincing
all
the
people
are
being
allowed.
more
evidence
would
have
secured
all
the
juries
vote
but
with
less
evidence,
ten
or
nine
in
louisiana
is
being
allowed.
the
most
difficult
jurors
to
convince
need
not
be
convinced
and
therefore,
i
think
it
is
plain
that
the
standard
of
proof
in
criminal
trials
is
being
lessened
by
a
rule,
which
allows
a
majority
verdict.
now,
just
very
briefly
on
the
figures,
kalven
and
zeisel
study
have
revealed.
across
the
country,
5.6
of
the
juries
hang.
5.6%
of
juries
hang
and
oregon,
3.1%
of
the
juries
hang.
what
that
means
is
approximately
2
and
1/2
%
of
all
the
criminal
trials.
you
get
a
verdict
in
oregon
where
you
would
not
get
a
verdict
elsewhere
and
we
think
those
are
the
hardest
cases
obviously.
the
cases
that
would
have
otherwise
hang
up.
the
cases
that
have
the
greatest
doubt
associated
with
them
and
it
is
those
cases
in
which
oregon
is
permitting
criminal
convictions
where
other
states
do
not.
now
the
kalven
and
zeisel--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes.
which
i
do
not
know
but
some
are
not
but
that
is
true.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
i
do
not
believe
that
is
true.
if
they
do,
i
had
missed
them,
i
do
not
believe
they
are
in
there,
their
convictions
are
not
going
to
retrial,
perhaps
i
am
mistaken.
but
what
kalven
and
zeisel
does
say
and
has
determined
from
their
empirical
data
is
when
a
jury
is
hung
10:2
or
11:1
at
the
end
of
the
process
of
deliberation.
that
reflects
greater
dissent
at
the
outset.
that
where
the
first
vote
is
11:1
or
10:2,
the
jury
will
not
hang,
but
it
is
where
that
there
is
8:4,
9:3
and
a
process
of
deliberation
succeeds
only
in
wheedling
down
that
number
to
two
or
one.
that
the
jury
would
not
hang
and
their
conclusion
is
that
those
are
the
very
cases
in
which
they
is
substantial
doubt
or
the
jury
cannot
resolve
the
doubt
and
those
are
the
cases
whether
historical
judgement
is
that
the
jury
should
be
hanged
up.
perhaps
on
retrial,
there
would
be
different
evidence,
more
evidence,
less
evidence
that
might
result
in
a
judgment
one
way
or
the
other
but
at
the
trial
which
is
being
held,
there
is
doubt
which
cannot
be
resolved
and
those
are
the
cases
which
historically
have
resulted
in
hang
juries
with
the
option
of
the
state
to
retry.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
the
incidents
would
increase
but
the
court
is
interpreting
the
constitution
and
there
is
a
deviation
from
the
historic
standing
which
is
only
been
recognized
by
this
court
which
is
proposed
here.
i
am
simply
arguing
for
the
maintenance
of
that
standard
not
for
something
new
had
left
argument
your
honor,
after
whether
we
simply
decide
these
cases
on
how
you
make
convictions
most
difficult
and
i
am
saying
obviously,
that
is
not
the
test.
but
where
you
have
a
system
and
the
system
here
is
unanimity
and
the
reasonable
doubts
standing
is
developed
within
the
context
of
that
system.
and
then
the
state
comes
along
and
says
well
we
are
going
to
have
lesser
proof.
then,
i
think
it
is
the
occasion
for
the
court
to
say
that
deviation
is
not
allowed
because
that
is
a
significantly
lesser
protection
for
the
defendant
than
what
the
historic
system
has
been.
in
williams,
the
court
said
12
or
6
is
not
going
to
make
any
difference
in
terms
of
the
defendant's
chances
of
winning
or
loosing
that
case.
here,
we
think
its
plain
that
when
10
are
voting
one
way
in
two
or
the
other
and
the
two
cannot
be
convinced,
you
are
making
a
difference.
you
are
lessening
what
you
need
for
a
conviction
and
that
is
a
deviation
from
the
reasonable
doubt
standard.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
is
an
acquittal.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
would
i
object
to
the
acquittal
if
i
represented
the
defendant?
no,
i
would
not
object
to
but
i
do
not
think
it
has
much
to
do
with
the
issue
before
the
court
which
the
deliberates
concerns,
protection
against
conviction,
what
you
have
to
do
before
you
can
convict
a
man
in
the
court
in
this
country.
i
do
not
think
you
can
balance
off
lesser
protections
against
conviction
by
a
rule,
which
allows
a
certain
number
of
addition
or
acquittal.
i
should
also
say
that
the
indications
are
and
they
may
or
may
not
be
accurate
but
the
study
indicated
by
kalven
and
zeisel
indicate
that
80%
of
those
extra
verdicts
in
oregon
are
convictions.
now,
my
third
point
as
to
the
functioning
and
i
must
be
very
brief
on
this.
the
third
point
as
to
the
function
of
the
unanimity
requirement
has
to
do
with
the
cross
section
cases
of
this
court.
the
court
has
held
a
cross
section
of
viewpoints
must
be
represented
on
the
jury.
i
am
not
going
to
argue
this
in
terms
of
a
race
or
any
particular
minority
but
it
is
very
perfectly
clear
from
scores
of
cases
in
this
court
that
there
is
an
important
function
of
a
jury
system
is
to
get
a
cross
section,
to
get
a
spectrum
of
use
or
any
–
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
the
panel
must
be
a
cross
section
and
the
jury
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
no,
but
when
the
jury
is
finally
chosen.
we
have
done
what
we
can
to
ensure
a
mix
of
use,
it
is
not
–
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir.
i
would.
i
think
that
you
come
as
close
as
you
can
within
the
concept
of
12
or
whatever
the
number
is.
that
there
is
a--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
well,
the
court
said
in
williams,
that
is
no
true.
the
court
said
that
there
is
no
significant
difference
and
i
do
not
re-argue
that.
i
do
not
have
a
question
before
me.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
no.
i
do
not
think
that
is
true.
i
think
what
mr.
justice
white
said
in
williams
is
that
12
is
not
40
any
way.
you
are
not
going
to
get
a
perfect
cross
section
either
way
and
6
as
to
12
is
not
going
to
make
that
substantial
difference
in
the
cross
section.
that
is
different
from
saying
this
man
is
on
the
jury,
we
have
done
our
best
to
get
a
cross
section.
it
is
not
scientifically
accurate
but
we
have
done
our
best,
there
he
is,
he
hears
the
case
but
his
views
are
not
going
to
be
considered
in
the
jury
room
because
the
first
vote
that
has
taken
shows
him
to
be
in
a
minority,
which
is
acceptable,
and
if
the
jury
returns
without
hearing
his
views,
without
incorporating
his
views.
now,
it
is
a
difference
in
degree
but
i
certainly
think
there
is
a
difference
where
you
got
the
man
on
the
jury
after
being
selected
and
he
is
excluded
by
virtue
of
the
process.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
i
think
that
in
both
cases,
you
are
excluding
a
viewpoint.
but
if
the
state
wants
to
do
something
and
make
convictions,
acquittals
easier,
i
am
not
here
to
argue
against
it.
i
do
not
think
that
raises
a
constitutional
issue.
but
certainly,
either
way,
you
are
excluding
a
viewpoint.
but
when
the
viewpoint
is
being
excluded
and
a
conviction
is
resulting,
i
think
it
raises
questions
under
the
sixth
amendment.
now,
the
last
point
on
the
functions
of
the
jury
system
has
to
do
with
the
public
respect
and
confidence
in
criminal
jury
verdicts.
in
winship,
the
court
referring
to
the
reasonable
doubt
stand.
it
said,
it
is
indispensable
to
command
the
respecting
competence
of
community
in
the
applications
the
criminal
law.
it
is
critical
that
the
moral
force
of
the
criminal
law
not
be
diluted
by
a
standard
of
proof
that
these
people
in
doubt
whether
innocent
men
are
being
condemned.
it
is
also
important
in
our
free
society
that
every
individual
going
about
his
affairs
has
confidence
that
his
government
cannot
adjudge
him
guilty
of
a
criminal
offense
without
convincing
a
proper
fact
finder
of
his
guilt
with
utmost
certainty.
now,
in
oregon
and
25%
of
the
criminal
trial
who
have
a
divided
verdict.
now,
i
think
that
that
is
a
serious
matter
in
terms
of
public
confidence
in
the
certainty
of
a
criminal
verdict.
that
there
is
something
historically
about
everybody
going
out
and
everybody
coming
back
and
saying
guilty
which
resolves
doubts
at
large
about
what
is
going
on
in
court.
when
you
got
a
quarter
of
the
cases
where
the
jury
is
not
in
agreement,
i
think
that
is
a
serious
matter
in
terms
of
public
confidence.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
well
i
have
never
been
to
oregon.
your
honor,
i
do
not
know
but
i
think
that
if
you
have
division
in
the
jury,
which
has
not
been
resolved
in
a
quarter
of
your
cases,
that
is
a
serious
matter
in
terms
of
the
historic
operation
of
the
criminal
system
in
this
country.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
that
is
doubt
in
my
mind
about
that
many
split
verdicts
particularly
where
it
is
so
unnecessary
because
while
they
are
having
25%
divided
verdicts.
if
the
jury
was
allowed
to
finish
its
process
of
deliberation,
the
nationwide
figure
indicates
that
the
huge
majority
of
those
cases
would
reach
a
judgment.
it
was
not
like
we
are
saying
that
a
verdict
could
not
otherwise
be
reached
in
those
cases.
80%
of
those
cases
it
could
be
reached.
only
5%
of
the
total
would
result
in
a
hung
jury,
so
it
is
a
process,
which
serves
so
little
purpose
in
terms
of
convenience
and
has
such
a
heavy
price
in
terms
of
the
appearance
of
what
is
going
on
in
court.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
3.1
where
the
national
average
is
5.6,
so
you
achieve
a
slight
lessoning
in
hang
juries
and
those
are
the
very
cases,
which
i
maintain
that
there
is
substantial
doubt.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
you
are
talking
about
judgments
being
reached
in
2%
additional
cases
which
is
a
lot
of
people
your
honor.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
it
is
2
and
1/2
percent
unless
there
is
a
convict
in
every
trial.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes.
but
of
course
one
thing
you
do
not
know
is
whether
the
process
of
deliberation
might
have
resulted
in
a
verdict
going
the
other
way.
whether
some
middle
ground
might
have
been
arranged.
we
do
not
have
a
jury
operates
that
make
–
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
we
do
not
know
which
way
it
is
hang
and
we
do
not
know
the
manner
in
which
it
would
have
achieved
unanimity.
what
else
might
have
happened
in
the
jury
room
in
terms
of
lesser
offenses
and
in
terms
of
dividing
counts.
we
do
not
know
any
of
that.
all
we
know
it
is
the
process
of
deliberation
has
been
short
circuited
in
the
middle
and
that
a
verdict
is
being
allowed
before
the
process
is
finished
in
most
of
those
25%
of
the
case.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
well,
from
kalven
and
zeisel
which
is
the
only
permission
i
have
mr.
justice
blackmun.
they
indicated
80%
of
those
divisions
are
for
conviction.
20%
of
the
division
is
for
acquittal.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
i
am
talking
80%
of
25%
yes
but
my
main
point
is
–
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
it
is
the
best
study
there
is.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
that
is
the
only
one.
now,
just
lastly
i
would
like
to
talk
about
the
significance
of
the
holding
in
this
case.
48
states
require
unanimity
in
cases
covered
by
the
sixth
amendment
under
baldwin.
only
2
do
not.
now,
in
duncan,
the
court
said
although
virtually
unanimous
adherence,
for
the
reasonable
doubts
standard
in
common
law
jurisdictions
may
not
conclusively
established.
it
is
a
requirement
of
due
process.
such
a
requirement
does
reflect
a
profound
judgment
about
the
way
in
which
the
law
should
be
enforced
and
justice
administered.
here,
the
court
is
faced
with
a
situation
in
which
48
states
have
resolved
this
question
one
way.
the
burdens
of
a
change
over
here
are
very
slight,
they
do
not
require
in
handling
more
juries
anything
else,
just
simply
the
different
instruction
to
the
jury.
and
in
closing,
i
would
like
to
make
one
last
point
which
keeps
occurring
to
me
and
that
is
that
oregon
did
not
mean
but
this
--
i
am
sorry
i
will
get
it
this
way.
oregon
did
not
determine
to
interpret
the
sixth
amendment
this
way.
when
oregon
adopted
this
statute,
the
constitutional
rule
out
of
this
court
was
that
there
is
no
state
jury
trial
requirement
and
i
dare
say
that
no
state
has
affirmatively
undertaken
to
interpret
the
sixth
amendment
requirement
to
allow
a
majority
verdict,
that
oregon
is
back
into
this
question
by
virtue
of
the
duncan
decision.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
in
oregon?
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
well,
it
is
very
interesting.
it
has
exactly
the
language
of
the
sixth
amendment
and
then
it
says
provided
however
that,
i
am
quoting
it
on
top
of
my
head.
in
circuit
courts
ten
out
of
12
juries
may
enter
a
judgment.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
well,
it
seems
to
me,
its
judgment
that
it
included
the
sixth
amendment
language
and
then
expressly
took
away
from
the
sixth
amendment
for
oregon
and
it
was
entitled
to
do
that
under
the
state
of
the
law.
the
law
now
is
that
the
sixth
amendment
applies
in
oregon.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
no
i
do
not.
i
would
say
it
is
not.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
it
does
not
say
so.
it
says
something
and
it
takes
it
away
and
i
think
the
myth
–
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
provided
however,
it
would
not
be
a
jury
trial
because
ten
or
12
are
going
to
be
allowed
to
convict
and
i
think
that
is
not
a
jury.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
i
would
not.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
it
was
an
amendment
in
1934.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
1934,
and
my
point
is
for
what
its
worth
is
that
at
the
time
that
decision
was
made,
it
was
not
made
in
light
of
sixth
amendment
requirements
because
there
were
not.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes.
the
oregon
judgment.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
thank
you
very
much,
here
are
my
comments.
i
would
like
to
make
a
few
very
brief
points.
firstly,
i
think
perhaps
the
court
has
been
stuck
as
i
was
during
the
argument
of
the
inappropriateness
of
making
innumerable
constitutional
decisions
as
to
whether
six
out
of
eight
or
10
out
of
12
or
9
out
of
12,
where
in
montana
8
out
of
12
or
odd
--
are
acceptable
under
the
sixth
amendment.
i
think
that
is
not
a
proper
constitutional
role
for
the
court.
i
think
there
must
be
a
more
objective
test
to
be
applied
than
just
juggling
all
these
numbers,
particularly
in
light
of
williams
where
we
know
at
least
that
the
number
can
range
from
six
to
twelve
and
the
combinations
are
very
large
and
i
think
the
court
ought
to
take
note
of
the
fact
that
what
is
getting
into.
if
it
starts
making
innumerable
determinations
as
to
which
combinations
are
enough
and
which
are
not.
secondly,
the
exclusion
of
minority
is
not
an
abuse
as
mr.
justice
marshall
pointed
out
by
his
questions,
that
if
there
is
a
10:2
vote
and
the
minority
is
not
firm,
the
verdicts
will
turn.
that
is
not
an
abusive
matter
that
can
be
later
corrected.
that
is
the
system.
and
to
argue,
it
can
later
be
corrected,
it
misses
the
point
that
that
is
exactly
what
is
allowed.
thirdly,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
kalven
and
zeisel
without
going
to
far
into
that
80:20
rate
cannot
be
said
to
be
a
rate
in
favor
of
acquittal.
perhaps
that
is
against
those
trial
that
result
of
an
outcome
but
i
think
the
important
point
is
that
when
the
jury
would
otherwise
hang.
the
result
in
some
four
to
five
cases
of
conviction,
now
that
is
not
a
benefit
to
the
defendant,
that
is
the
detriment
to
the
defendant.
what
if
the
consequences
are
of
that?
i
think
that
point
should
be
clear
that
more
--
that
four
or
fifths
of
those
cases,
there
is
going
to
be
a
conviction
and
lastly,
i
would
like
to
just
note
that
the
citation
which
is
not
in
our
brief
to
the
constitutional
history
which
makes
very
clear
that
the
deletion
of
the
amendment
of
the
sixth
amendment
having
to
do
with
unanimity
concerns
vicinage
and
not
unanimity.
it

in
which
madison’s
letters
make
clear
what
the
debate
was
about
and
was
not
about.
and
of
course,
the
ninth
amendment
was
enacted
expressly
to
secure
that
simply
because
a
right
was
not
expressly
set
forth
in
the
bill
of
rights,
it
would
not
be
read
to
have
been
intended
not
to
be
secured.
i
thank
the
court
very
much.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
1968,
this
court
decided
duncan
against
louisiana
in
which
it
held
for
the
first
time
that
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
trial
by
jury
is
applicable
to
criminal
trials
of
state
court
by
virtue
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
a
month
later
in
destefano
against
woods,
the
court
held
that
the
holding
in
duncan
would
only
be
applied
to
cases
tried
after
the
date
of
the
decision
in
duncan.
after
duncan,
the
three
petitioners
in
these
cases
were
tried
in
circuit
courts
of
oregon
for
serious
crimes
and
each
of
them
were
convicted
by
a
split
verdict
under
the
procedure
authorized
by
the
oregon
constitution
of
allowing
a
criminal
verdict
with
10
out
of
12
juries
concurring.
the
votes
in
the
respective
cases
were
11:1
and
two
of
them
in
10:2
in
the
third.
the
jury
in
each
of
these
three
cases
was
out
of
the
courtroom
in
the
jury
room
for
less
than
an
hour
in
one
case
for
less
than
a
half
an
hour.
the
convictions
were
appealed
to
the
oregon
court
of
appeals
raising
the
argument
that
the
sixth
amendment
rights
annunciated
by
duncan
had
been
violated
by
the
acceptance
of
a
split
jury
verdict
and
the
court
of
appeals
of
oregon
following
a
very
recent
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
affirmed
the
convictions
and
held
that
the
sixth
amendment
does
not
guarantee
the
right
to
a
unanimous
jury
verdict.
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
refused
review
of
the
cases
and
the
cases
that
here
on
certiorari
to
this
court.
the
question
therefore,
which
is
presented
in
light
of
duncan
and
destefano
against
woods,
is
whether
the
sixth
amendment
permits
a
conviction
for
serious
crime
without
a
unanimous
jury
verdict
and
i
would
like,
to
in
light
of
the
arguments
made
with
the
state
of
oregon,
define
that
question
even
further
and
that
is
where
there
is
no
state
procedure
for
minimum
periods
of
deliberation,
which
is
the
case
here,
whether
the
sixth
amendment
permits
a
conviction
of
a
serious
crime
without
a
unanimous
jury
verdict.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
i
think
it
would
be
a
different
case.
my
personal
view
on
it
was
that,
it
would
still
not
be
satisfactory
but
the
reference
in
the
state's
brief
to
the
english
system
on
the
proposal
of
the
american
bar
association
are
systems
and
proposals
which
as
part
of
them
secure
a
minimum
period
of
deliberation.
the
draftsmen
in
both
those
cases
recognize
what
we
think
is
a
very
important
value
lost
by
the
oregon
system
of
requiring
jury
deliberation
and
i
think
when
and
if
that
case
ever
gets
here,
the
court
would
have
different
question.
if
another
provision
is
made
to
ensure
deliberation,
whether
or
not
that
insurance
is
satisfactory.
now
in
1970,
in
williams
against
florida,
the
court
passed
on
the
question
of
the
six
man
juries
in
florida.
and
the
court
held
that
although
there
had
been
a
six
manned
jury
historically
at
common
law
and
although
the
court
in
past
have
indicated
that
the
sixth
amendment
does
in
fact
require,
i
am
sorry
there
had
been
a
twelve
man
jury
at
common
law
and
although
the
court,
this
court
had
indicated
in
the
past,
the
twelve
juries
are
required
under
the
sixth
amendment
and
reconsidering
the
question,
the
court
made
a
two-step
analysis.
first,
it
said
that
the
history
of
the
constitution,
the
history
of
the
sixth
amendment
left
the
question
open.
that
it
was
impossible
to
tell
from
the
historical
materials
what
the
draftsman
of
the
sixth
amendment
meant
on
this
point.
and
mr.
justice
white
for
the
court
said,
the
way
we
are
going
to
determine
which
feature
of
jury
trial
right
at
common
law
is
incorporated
in
the
sixth
amendment
is
to
determine
whether
the
feature
in
question
serves
an
important
purpose
in
terms
of
the
functioning
of
the
jury
system.
it
is
a
practical
test
to
be
applied.
applying
that
test,
the
court
held
twelve
men
are
not
required
and
specifically
left
open
with
the
question
of
whether
a
unanimous
jury
verdict
is
required.
now,
we
are
arguing
this
case
squarely
within
the
holding
and
the
test
annunciated
in
williams,
and
we
think
the
application
of
this
test
resolves
the
case
in
our
favor,
because
the
requirement
of
a
unanimous
jury
verdict
serves
four
very
important
purposes
in
terms
of
the
basic
function
of
the
jury
process.
those
four
purposes
are,
it
ensures
that
the
jury
enters
into
meaningful
deliberation.
we
think
it
serves
an
important
purpose
in
maintaining
the
reasonable
doubts
stated
in
criminal
trials.
we
think
it
maintains
an
important
purpose
in
giving
meaning
and
effect
to
this
court's
decision,
requiring
it
of
a
cross
section
of
the
community
jury
decisions
and
we
think
it
serves
an
important
function
in
terms
of
community.
we
respect
in
confidence
in
the
processes
of
the
criminal
law
and
in
convictions
for
the
secured
criminal
cases.
and
i
would
like
to
discuss
each
of
these
four
functions
to
indicate
their
breadth.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir.
they
are
constitutional
in
this
sense,
interpreting
the
sixth
amendment
in
williams
against
florida.
this
court
said
that
the
way
to
resolve
the
constitutional
and
to
the
issue
of
constitutional
interpretation
in
the
sixth
amendment,
what
does
jury
mean?
it
means
something
and
the
court
said
in
terms
of
deciding
what
it
means,
we
are
going
to
look
to
it,
the
functional
importance
of
the
requisite
of
a
jury
trial
on
issue
here.
that
was
the
sixth
amendment
test
enunciated
by
mr.
justice
white
for
the
court.
we
are
simply
taking
that
test
and
arguing
this
case
that
unlike
any
fixed
number
of
juries,
the
requirement
of
unanimity
is
a
concept
which
serves
very
important
functions
and
therefore
meets
the
constitutional
test
enunciated
by
the
court.
in
1896,
allen
against
united
states,
this
court
said
the
very
object
of
the
jury
system
is
to
secure
unanimity
by
comparison
of
use
and
by
arguments
among
jurors
themselves.
the
unanimity
requirement
is
the
aspect
of
the
jury
trial
system
which
ensures
that
the
jurors
will
go
into
the
jury
room
and
exchange
views.
the
work
that
has
been
jogged
down
in
the
jury
area
by
kalven
and
zeisel
indicate
that
in
states
such
as
oregon
and
louisiana,
the
two
states
that
have
split
verdicts.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
allen
was
a
federal
case
your
honor.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
i
think
in
allen,
the
court
was
talking
about
the
jury
system
constitutionally.
it
was
a
case
having
to
do
with
a
choice
of
the
jury
trial
and
did
not
raise
this
issue.
i
am
just
indicating
that
in
allen,
the
court
was
referring
to
the
operation
of
the
system
and
what
was
important
functional.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
there
was
an
amendment
in
the
house
to
include
unanimity
as
the
specific
requirement
of
the
sixth
amendment.
that
amendment
was
unsuccessful
in
analyzing
that
exact
amendment
in
williams.
the
court
said
that
it
is
not
possible
to
determine
whether
the
unanimity
requirement,
along
with
the
other
aspects
of
that
amendment
was
stricken
because
everybody
knew
the
jury
trial
meant
unanimity
or
because
the
congress
did
not
wanted
it.
and
in
approaching
this
case
your
honor,
we
have
simply
accepted
the
very
recent
interpretation
of
that
very
legislative
history
in
williams
and
accepted
that
conclusion
that
it
is
6
of
one
half
dozen
that
the
other,
it
is
impossible
to
determine
from
that
with
legislative
history
what
exactly
the
framers
had
in
mind.
i
would
point
out
that
the
major
controversy
concerning
that
amendment
did
not
have
to
do
in
any
respect
with
the
requirement
of
unanimity.
the
main
argument
about
the
amendment
was
a
proposal
to
put
vicinage
in
the
sixth
amendment,
to
require
that
a
specific
district
as
a
common
law
be
incorporated
in
the
constitution.
the
debate
was
about
that
point
as
the
journals
of
the
constitution
reflected
so
on
in
our
brief
and
that
the
amendment
was
deleted
with
respect
to
that
issue.
the
whole
of
amendment
was
deleted
but
that
the
controversy,
that
the
congress
was
focusing
on
was
the
vicinage
requirement
which
was
not
a
desired
to
be
included
and
with
that,
the
entire
subsection
was
deleted.
analyzing
that
as
i
said
in
williams,
the
court
said
you
really
cannot
tell
what
the
congress
meant
in
its
drafting
and
that
again,
the
question
has
to
be
decided
in
terms
of
whether
the
issue,
the
requisite
is
functional
in
terms
of
the
jury
system.
now,
the
unanimity
requirement
means
that
the
jury
cannot
come
out
of
the
jury
room
until
everybody
agrees,
and
because
everybody
has
to
agree,
the
process
means
that
everyone
sits
out
at
the
table
and
hears
the
views
of
all
the
juries
and
this
is
important
because,
the
idea
of
having
more
than
one
juror
is
that
different
jurors
are
going
to
see
the
questions
differently
and
are
going
to
have
different
perceptions
of
the
evidence
and
the
reason
that
a
jury
verdict
is
a
fine
a
thing
as
it
is
that
if
everybody’s
view
of
the
evidence,
everybody’s
interpretation
has
been
merged,
has
been
handed
out,
has
been
considered
by
everybody,
so
that
when
the
jury
comes
out
of
the
jury
box
in
the
jury
room
and
announces
its
verdict,
you
have
a
collective
judgement
which
is
considering
the
views
of
everybody.
now
–
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
no
sir.
i
am
saying
that
when
in
this
country,
you
talk
about
juries.
its
intrinsic
meaning
means
unanimity
that
the
jury
system
does
not
function
as
we
know
it
without
unanimity
and
mr.
justice
white
in
williams
said
that
is
the
question
the
court
must
ask
when
it
is
up
for
consideration,
whether
a
particular
feature
is
included
in
the
sixth
amendment.
i
am
simply
taking
up
that
test
and
saying
that
without
deliberation,
you
do
not
have
a
jury
as
we
know
it
in
this
country
that
the
--
as
the
court
said,
the
very
object
of
a
system
is
to
secure
unanimity
by
a
comparison
abuse
and
by
an
arguments
among
jurors.
now
in
–
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
well,
i
think
no.
it
would
not
apply.
i
think
that
there
are,
as
the
courts
recognized
innumerably
are
the
case
like
in
re
winship
comes
to
mind.
there
are
certain
interests
at
stake
in
a
criminal
trial
by
which
the
society
has
historically
wanted
to
be
very
careful
about
erroneous
convictions.
the
risk
of
error
in
terms
of
a
criminal
conviction
has
historically
been
thought
in
this
country
to
be
a
much
more
serious
matter
than
the
risk
of
error
in
a
civil
case
that
enumerable
procedures
have
been
established
in
criminal
cases
to
lessen
the
risk
of
error
in
fact
finding
which
is
always
present.
now,
i
think
the
absence
of
unanimity
certainly
increases
the
risk
of
error
and
the
risk
of
an
erroneous
conviction
and
i
think
that
the
consideration,
the
stakes
in
civil
cases
are
very,
are
different
and
a
very
important
spec.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
well,
your
honor
personally,
i
think
that
there
should
be
no
time
limit,
there
should
be
no
procedure
whereby
the
majority
can
simply
sit
out
the
minority.
but
i
do,
very
firmly
want
to
indicate
to
the
court
that
i
think
that
is
a
very
different
case
and
i
do
not
think
oregon
can
defend
its
procedure
in
this
court
by
saying
well,
in
england;
there
is
a
minimum
period
deliberation.
a
minimum
period
deliberation
is
undoubtedly
a
step
toward
retaining
this
feature
of
the
jury
system.
in
states
like
oregon,
when
the
jury
goes
into
the
jury
room
and
takes
its
first
vote.
if
they
voted
10:2,
there
is
no
discussion.
they
return
to
the
jury
room
and
announce
that
verdict.
if
the
vote
is
8:4
and
after
an
hour
it
turns
to
10:2,
there
is
no
further
consideration
of
the
minority
viewpoint.
now,
in
these
cases,
the
juries
all
out
a
matter,
minutes
and
i
think
that
whatever
maybe
the
ultimate
decision
where
a
state
adopts
a
minimum
period
of
deliberation
system
as
they
have
in
england
and
at
the
american
bar
association
has
recommended,
it
certainly
has
no
relevance
in
defending
the
constitutionality
of
this
system
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
well,
they
would
have
been
a
12
man
jury
which
would
have
conceited
the
evidence.
which
would
have
deliberated
and
which
would
have
reached
a
verdict
and
i
think
the
first
jury
would
not
be
relevant.
in
my
view,
if
there
was
a
24-man
jury
together
and
22
voted.
yes,
i
guess
i
would
make
the
same
argument.
i
think
that
there
is
an
important
value
of
the
jury
system
in
hearing
what
the
different
view
points
are.
that
is
why
you
have
more
than
one
jury,
more
than
one
juror
because
people
see
things
differently.
that
is
one
of
the
basic
human
lessons
and
you
want
to
give
what
everybody
has
to
say.
that
is
what
a
jury
system
is
and
i
think
if
you
were
to
exclude
that
in
the
process
and
in
the
jury
room,
i
would
make
the
same
argument
regardless
of
the
number.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
certainly.
a
lot
depends
on
the
luck
of
the
draw,
but
once
it
is
drawn,
the
system
is
to
hear
what
everybody
has
to
say
before
a
vote
in
written
at
the
very
least
and
i
say
more
than
that
to
work
it
out
so
if
you
do
have
a
unanimous
collective
judgement.
now,
my
second
contention
with
respect
to
what
the
function
of
unanimity
is,
has
to
do
with
reasonable
doubt
as
the
court
knows
in
winship,
it
indicated
the
reasonable
doubt
stands
as
constitutionally
required.
now,
reasonable
doubt
was
developed
in
the
context
of
a
unanimous
jury
verdict.
what
it
means
that
a
prosecutor
has
to
convince
every
juror
to
convict
this
man
and
specifically
what
that
means
is
the
juror
with
the
highest
standard,
the
most
doubting
juror
must
be
convicted.
i
think
it
is
beyond
argument
that
when
you
say
the
prosecutor
needs
to
only
convince
less
than
all
the
juries,
that
he
needs
–
that
a
lesser
burden
of
proof
is
being
put
on
the
state.
the
convictions
on
less
evidence,
conviction
without
convincing
all
the
people
are
being
allowed.
more
evidence
would
have
secured
all
the
juries
vote
but
with
less
evidence,
ten
or
nine
in
louisiana
is
being
allowed.
the
most
difficult
jurors
to
convince
need
not
be
convinced
and
therefore,
i
think
it
is
plain
that
the
standard
of
proof
in
criminal
trials
is
being
lessened
by
a
rule,
which
allows
a
majority
verdict.
now,
just
very
briefly
on
the
figures,
kalven
and
zeisel
study
have
revealed.
across
the
country,
5.6
of
the
juries
hang.
5.6%
of
juries
hang
and
oregon,
3.1%
of
the
juries
hang.
what
that
means
is
approximately
2
and
1/2
%
of
all
the
criminal
trials.
you
get
a
verdict
in
oregon
where
you
would
not
get
a
verdict
elsewhere
and
we
think
those
are
the
hardest
cases
obviously.
the
cases
that
would
have
otherwise
hang
up.
the
cases
that
have
the
greatest
doubt
associated
with
them
and
it
is
those
cases
in
which
oregon
is
permitting
criminal
convictions
where
other
states
do
not.
now
the
kalven
and
zeisel--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes.
which
i
do
not
know
but
some
are
not
but
that
is
true.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
i
do
not
believe
that
is
true.
if
they
do,
i
had
missed
them,
i
do
not
believe
they
are
in
there,
their
convictions
are
not
going
to
retrial,
perhaps
i
am
mistaken.
but
what
kalven
and
zeisel
does
say
and
has
determined
from
their
empirical
data
is
when
a
jury
is
hung
10:2
or
11:1
at
the
end
of
the
process
of
deliberation.
that
reflects
greater
dissent
at
the
outset.
that
where
the
first
vote
is
11:1
or
10:2,
the
jury
will
not
hang,
but
it
is
where
that
there
is
8:4,
9:3
and
a
process
of
deliberation
succeeds
only
in
wheedling
down
that
number
to
two
or
one.
that
the
jury
would
not
hang
and
their
conclusion
is
that
those
are
the
very
cases
in
which
they
is
substantial
doubt
or
the
jury
cannot
resolve
the
doubt
and
those
are
the
cases
whether
historical
judgement
is
that
the
jury
should
be
hanged
up.
perhaps
on
retrial,
there
would
be
different
evidence,
more
evidence,
less
evidence
that
might
result
in
a
judgment
one
way
or
the
other
but
at
the
trial
which
is
being
held,
there
is
doubt
which
cannot
be
resolved
and
those
are
the
cases
which
historically
have
resulted
in
hang
juries
with
the
option
of
the
state
to
retry.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
the
incidents
would
increase
but
the
court
is
interpreting
the
constitution
and
there
is
a
deviation
from
the
historic
standing
which
is
only
been
recognized
by
this
court
which
is
proposed
here.
i
am
simply
arguing
for
the
maintenance
of
that
standard
not
for
something
new
had
left
argument
your
honor,
after
whether
we
simply
decide
these
cases
on
how
you
make
convictions
most
difficult
and
i
am
saying
obviously,
that
is
not
the
test.
but
where
you
have
a
system
and
the
system
here
is
unanimity
and
the
reasonable
doubts
standing
is
developed
within
the
context
of
that
system.
and
then
the
state
comes
along
and
says
well
we
are
going
to
have
lesser
proof.
then,
i
think
it
is
the
occasion
for
the
court
to
say
that
deviation
is
not
allowed
because
that
is
a
significantly
lesser
protection
for
the
defendant
than
what
the
historic
system
has
been.
in
williams,
the
court
said
12
or
6
is
not
going
to
make
any
difference
in
terms
of
the
defendant's
chances
of
winning
or
loosing
that
case.
here,
we
think
its
plain
that
when
10
are
voting
one
way
in
two
or
the
other
and
the
two
cannot
be
convinced,
you
are
making
a
difference.
you
are
lessening
what
you
need
for
a
conviction
and
that
is
a
deviation
from
the
reasonable
doubt
standard.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
is
an
acquittal.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
would
i
object
to
the
acquittal
if
i
represented
the
defendant?
no,
i
would
not
object
to
but
i
do
not
think
it
has
much
to
do
with
the
issue
before
the
court
which
the
deliberates
concerns,
protection
against
conviction,
what
you
have
to
do
before
you
can
convict
a
man
in
the
court
in
this
country.
i
do
not
think
you
can
balance
off
lesser
protections
against
conviction
by
a
rule,
which
allows
a
certain
number
of
addition
or
acquittal.
i
should
also
say
that
the
indications
are
and
they
may
or
may
not
be
accurate
but
the
study
indicated
by
kalven
and
zeisel
indicate
that
80%
of
those
extra
verdicts
in
oregon
are
convictions.
now,
my
third
point
as
to
the
functioning
and
i
must
be
very
brief
on
this.
the
third
point
as
to
the
function
of
the
unanimity
requirement
has
to
do
with
the
cross
section
cases
of
this
court.
the
court
has
held
a
cross
section
of
viewpoints
must
be
represented
on
the
jury.
i
am
not
going
to
argue
this
in
terms
of
a
race
or
any
particular
minority
but
it
is
very
perfectly
clear
from
scores
of
cases
in
this
court
that
there
is
an
important
function
of
a
jury
system
is
to
get
a
cross
section,
to
get
a
spectrum
of
use
or
any
–
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
the
panel
must
be
a
cross
section
and
the
jury
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
no,
but
when
the
jury
is
finally
chosen.
we
have
done
what
we
can
to
ensure
a
mix
of
use,
it
is
not
–
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir.
i
would.
i
think
that
you
come
as
close
as
you
can
within
the
concept
of
12
or
whatever
the
number
is.
that
there
is
a--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
well,
the
court
said
in
williams,
that
is
no
true.
the
court
said
that
there
is
no
significant
difference
and
i
do
not
re-argue
that.
i
do
not
have
a
question
before
me.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
no.
i
do
not
think
that
is
true.
i
think
what
mr.
justice
white
said
in
williams
is
that
12
is
not
40
any
way.
you
are
not
going
to
get
a
perfect
cross
section
either
way
and
6
as
to
12
is
not
going
to
make
that
substantial
difference
in
the
cross
section.
that
is
different
from
saying
this
man
is
on
the
jury,
we
have
done
our
best
to
get
a
cross
section.
it
is
not
scientifically
accurate
but
we
have
done
our
best,
there
he
is,
he
hears
the
case
but
his
views
are
not
going
to
be
considered
in
the
jury
room
because
the
first
vote
that
has
taken
shows
him
to
be
in
a
minority,
which
is
acceptable,
and
if
the
jury
returns
without
hearing
his
views,
without
incorporating
his
views.
now,
it
is
a
difference
in
degree
but
i
certainly
think
there
is
a
difference
where
you
got
the
man
on
the
jury
after
being
selected
and
he
is
excluded
by
virtue
of
the
process.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
i
think
that
in
both
cases,
you
are
excluding
a
viewpoint.
but
if
the
state
wants
to
do
something
and
make
convictions,
acquittals
easier,
i
am
not
here
to
argue
against
it.
i
do
not
think
that
raises
a
constitutional
issue.
but
certainly,
either
way,
you
are
excluding
a
viewpoint.
but
when
the
viewpoint
is
being
excluded
and
a
conviction
is
resulting,
i
think
it
raises
questions
under
the
sixth
amendment.
now,
the
last
point
on
the
functions
of
the
jury
system
has
to
do
with
the
public
respect
and
confidence
in
criminal
jury
verdicts.
in
winship,
the
court
referring
to
the
reasonable
doubt
stand.
it
said,
it
is
indispensable
to
command
the
respecting
competence
of
community
in
the
applications
the
criminal
law.
it
is
critical
that
the
moral
force
of
the
criminal
law
not
be
diluted
by
a
standard
of
proof
that
these
people
in
doubt
whether
innocent
men
are
being
condemned.
it
is
also
important
in
our
free
society
that
every
individual
going
about
his
affairs
has
confidence
that
his
government
cannot
adjudge
him
guilty
of
a
criminal
offense
without
convincing
a
proper
fact
finder
of
his
guilt
with
utmost
certainty.
now,
in
oregon
and
25%
of
the
criminal
trial
who
have
a
divided
verdict.
now,
i
think
that
that
is
a
serious
matter
in
terms
of
public
confidence
in
the
certainty
of
a
criminal
verdict.
that
there
is
something
historically
about
everybody
going
out
and
everybody
coming
back
and
saying
guilty
which
resolves
doubts
at
large
about
what
is
going
on
in
court.
when
you
got
a
quarter
of
the
cases
where
the
jury
is
not
in
agreement,
i
think
that
is
a
serious
matter
in
terms
of
public
confidence.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
well
i
have
never
been
to
oregon.
your
honor,
i
do
not
know
but
i
think
that
if
you
have
division
in
the
jury,
which
has
not
been
resolved
in
a
quarter
of
your
cases,
that
is
a
serious
matter
in
terms
of
the
historic
operation
of
the
criminal
system
in
this
country.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
that
is
doubt
in
my
mind
about
that
many
split
verdicts
particularly
where
it
is
so
unnecessary
because
while
they
are
having
25%
divided
verdicts.
if
the
jury
was
allowed
to
finish
its
process
of
deliberation,
the
nationwide
figure
indicates
that
the
huge
majority
of
those
cases
would
reach
a
judgment.
it
was
not
like
we
are
saying
that
a
verdict
could
not
otherwise
be
reached
in
those
cases.
80%
of
those
cases
it
could
be
reached.
only
5%
of
the
total
would
result
in
a
hung
jury,
so
it
is
a
process,
which
serves
so
little
purpose
in
terms
of
convenience
and
has
such
a
heavy
price
in
terms
of
the
appearance
of
what
is
going
on
in
court.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
3.1
where
the
national
average
is
5.6,
so
you
achieve
a
slight
lessoning
in
hang
juries
and
those
are
the
very
cases,
which
i
maintain
that
there
is
substantial
doubt.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
you
are
talking
about
judgments
being
reached
in
2%
additional
cases
which
is
a
lot
of
people
your
honor.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
it
is
2
and
1/2
percent
unless
there
is
a
convict
in
every
trial.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes.
but
of
course
one
thing
you
do
not
know
is
whether
the
process
of
deliberation
might
have
resulted
in
a
verdict
going
the
other
way.
whether
some
middle
ground
might
have
been
arranged.
we
do
not
have
a
jury
operates
that
make
–
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
we
do
not
know
which
way
it
is
hang
and
we
do
not
know
the
manner
in
which
it
would
have
achieved
unanimity.
what
else
might
have
happened
in
the
jury
room
in
terms
of
lesser
offenses
and
in
terms
of
dividing
counts.
we
do
not
know
any
of
that.
all
we
know
it
is
the
process
of
deliberation
has
been
short
circuited
in
the
middle
and
that
a
verdict
is
being
allowed
before
the
process
is
finished
in
most
of
those
25%
of
the
case.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
well,
from
kalven
and
zeisel
which
is
the
only
permission
i
have
mr.
justice
blackmun.
they
indicated
80%
of
those
divisions
are
for
conviction.
20%
of
the
division
is
for
acquittal.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
i
am
talking
80%
of
25%
yes
but
my
main
point
is
–
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
it
is
the
best
study
there
is.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
that
is
the
only
one.
now,
just
lastly
i
would
like
to
talk
about
the
significance
of
the
holding
in
this
case.
48
states
require
unanimity
in
cases
covered
by
the
sixth
amendment
under
baldwin.
only
2
do
not.
now,
in
duncan,
the
court
said
although
virtually
unanimous
adherence,
for
the
reasonable
doubts
standard
in
common
law
jurisdictions
may
not
conclusively
established.
it
is
a
requirement
of
due
process.
such
a
requirement
does
reflect
a
profound
judgment
about
the
way
in
which
the
law
should
be
enforced
and
justice
administered.
here,
the
court
is
faced
with
a
situation
in
which
48
states
have
resolved
this
question
one
way.
the
burdens
of
a
change
over
here
are
very
slight,
they
do
not
require
in
handling
more
juries
anything
else,
just
simply
the
different
instruction
to
the
jury.
and
in
closing,
i
would
like
to
make
one
last
point
which
keeps
occurring
to
me
and
that
is
that
oregon
did
not
mean
but
this
--
i
am
sorry
i
will
get
it
this
way.
oregon
did
not
determine
to
interpret
the
sixth
amendment
this
way.
when
oregon
adopted
this
statute,
the
constitutional
rule
out
of
this
court
was
that
there
is
no
state
jury
trial
requirement
and
i
dare
say
that
no
state
has
affirmatively
undertaken
to
interpret
the
sixth
amendment
requirement
to
allow
a
majority
verdict,
that
oregon
is
back
into
this
question
by
virtue
of
the
duncan
decision.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
in
oregon?
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
well,
it
is
very
interesting.
it
has
exactly
the
language
of
the
sixth
amendment
and
then
it
says
provided
however
that,
i
am
quoting
it
on
top
of
my
head.
in
circuit
courts
ten
out
of
12
juries
may
enter
a
judgment.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
well,
it
seems
to
me,
its
judgment
that
it
included
the
sixth
amendment
language
and
then
expressly
took
away
from
the
sixth
amendment
for
oregon
and
it
was
entitled
to
do
that
under
the
state
of
the
law.
the
law
now
is
that
the
sixth
amendment
applies
in
oregon.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
no
i
do
not.
i
would
say
it
is
not.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
it
does
not
say
so.
it
says
something
and
it
takes
it
away
and
i
think
the
myth
–
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
provided
however,
it
would
not
be
a
jury
trial
because
ten
or
12
are
going
to
be
allowed
to
convict
and
i
think
that
is
not
a
jury.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
i
would
not.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
it
was
an
amendment
in
1934.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
1934,
and
my
point
is
for
what
its
worth
is
that
at
the
time
that
decision
was
made,
it
was
not
made
in
light
of
sixth
amendment
requirements
because
there
were
not.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes.
the
oregon
judgment.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
thank
you
very
much,
here
are
my
comments.
i
would
like
to
make
a
few
very
brief
points.
firstly,
i
think
perhaps
the
court
has
been
stuck
as
i
was
during
the
argument
of
the
inappropriateness
of
making
innumerable
constitutional
decisions
as
to
whether
six
out
of
eight
or
10
out
of
12
or
9
out
of
12,
where
in
montana
8
out
of
12
or
odd
--
are
acceptable
under
the
sixth
amendment.
i
think
that
is
not
a
proper
constitutional
role
for
the
court.
i
think
there
must
be
a
more
objective
test
to
be
applied
than
just
juggling
all
these
numbers,
particularly
in
light
of
williams
where
we
know
at
least
that
the
number
can
range
from
six
to
twelve
and
the
combinations
are
very
large
and
i
think
the
court
ought
to
take
note
of
the
fact
that
what
is
getting
into.
if
it
starts
making
innumerable
determinations
as
to
which
combinations
are
enough
and
which
are
not.
secondly,
the
exclusion
of
minority
is
not
an
abuse
as
mr.
justice
marshall
pointed
out
by
his
questions,
that
if
there
is
a
10:2
vote
and
the
minority
is
not
firm,
the
verdicts
will
turn.
that
is
not
an
abusive
matter
that
can
be
later
corrected.
that
is
the
system.
and
to
argue,
it
can
later
be
corrected,
it
misses
the
point
that
that
is
exactly
what
is
allowed.
thirdly,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
kalven
and
zeisel
without
going
to
far
into
that
80:20
rate
cannot
be
said
to
be
a
rate
in
favor
of
acquittal.
perhaps
that
is
against
those
trial
that
result
of
an
outcome
but
i
think
the
important
point
is
that
when
the
jury
would
otherwise
hang.
the
result
in
some
four
to
five
cases
of
conviction,
now
that
is
not
a
benefit
to
the
defendant,
