justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
mr.
sobol,
oregon
system,
at
least
as
i
understand
it,
is
a
two-way
street
and
i
wonder,
as
my
brother
harlan
did,
about
the
breadth
of
your
argument
on
behalf
--
to
the
point
that
this
permits
the
--
perhaps
the
arbitrary
of
conviction
of
an
innocent
man.
it
often
prevents
or
it
often
permits
the
acquittal
of
an
innocent
man
against
the
one
or
two
perverse
characters
on
the
jury
who,
whatever
that
man
may
have
said
on
voir
dire
or
convinced
that
anybody
who
is
charged
in
a
courtroom
is
automatically
guilty,
because
if
10
out
of
12
of
the
jurors
vote
to
acquit,
those
two
perverse
characters
can't
hang
up
the
jury
and
prevent
the
man's
acquittal.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
at
the
ultimate
deadlock?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
already
told
us
that
the
ultimate
deadlock
doesn't
come
after
an
initial
division
of
10-2.
the
ultimate
deadlock
comes
after
a
much
more
even
division
initially,
don't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
this
again
is

justice
potter
stewart
well
certainly
the
bill
of
rights
is
designed
to
protect
a
fair
trial,
the
fairness
of
a
trial,
aren't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
i
hope
--
let
me
just
interrupt
you
at
the
outset
that
you
don't
spend
all
the
balance
of
your
time
on
that
point
because
frankly
for
me,
i
think
the
most
troublesome
or
the
most
affected
part
of
counsel's
argument
is
this.
that
after
100
years,
after
i
don't
know
how
many
dozens
or
hundreds
of
cases
--
decided
cases
in
this
court
hold
to
the
effect
that
the
constitution
requires
a
representative
jury
and,
particularly,
requires
that
representatives
of
minority
groups
be
on
juries.
and,
under
the
oregon
system,
let's
assume
a
jury
of
10
white
people
and
2
negroes,
the
jury
can
go
into
the
jury
room.
the
10
white
people
or
the
foreman
could
say
“you
two
negroes
go
over
there
and
sit
in
the
corner
and
we
10
white
people
are
going
to
decide
this
case.”
that,
to
me,
is
the
most
--
at
least
a
very
effective
part
of
his
argument.
i
hope
you'll
deal
with
it
if
you
can.
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
be
in
conformity
with
the
oregon
system,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
nothing
corrupt
or
dishonest
about
that.
that
would
be
in
conformity
with
the
oregon
system.
justice
potter
stewart
whatever
its
rationale,
and
there
are
certain
maybe
several
different
rationales
that
had
been
proposed
as
a
justification
for
this,
the
court
has
held
that
no
minority
group
may
be
excluded
from
juries,
as
members
of
minority
groups
and
so,
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
rather
taken
the
hypothesis
that
they
are
representatives,
if
you
will.
justice
potter
stewart
and
yet
the
oregon
system
allows
the
majority
of
the
jury
itself,
the
five
--
the
10-men
majority
of
the
jury
to
exclude
two
of
its
members
from
the
jury
