chief

warren
e.

we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
number
53-38,
apodaca
and
others
against
oregon.
mr.
sobol,
you
may
proceed
when
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
when
you
say
“was
incorporated
from
framers,”
from
the
colonies
that
had
less
than
unanimous
verdicts
or
from
the
english
common
law?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
the
standard
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
constitution
or
something
other
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
does
mr.
madison's
unsuccessful
effort
to
have
the
unanimous
verdict
enter
into
the
scales,
if
it
enters
in?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
haven't
we
had
some
of
those?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
don't
we
have
some
of
those?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
was
talking
about
cases
generally,
in
civil
cases?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
reserved
it
because
it
wasn't
there.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
that
same
argument,
that
same
rationale
would
apply
to
the
congress
and
house
of
the
senate,
would
it
not?
we
have
guarantees
that
make
sure
that
any
person
meeting
the
constitutional
qualifications
may
run
for
the
house
of
the
senate,
but
that
doesn't
guarantee
that
they're
going
to
have
their
way.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
don't
they
participate
in
the
process?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
they
don't
get
their
way?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
difference
does
it
make
if
it's
the
first
ballot
or
the
tenth
ballot?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
to
speculate
a
lot
there
to
make
that
suggestion,
don't
you?
you
have
to
speculate
that
they
were
not
permitted.
for
all
you
know,
the
foreman
said
“no,
we'll
stay
here
for
six
hours.
if
you
want
to
be
heard”
and
the
three
say
“no,
we've
had
our
chance.
we
want
to
go
home.”
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
my
speculation
is
what
is
valid
is
yours,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
you
can't
really
rest
much
on
those
speculated
things,
can
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
sobol.
mr.
tanzer,
mr.
sobol
has
used
up
his
entire
time.
we'll
try
to
finish
today.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
that
unique
situation
arose
or
even
prompt
the
word
“unique,”
if
that
arose,
the
foreman
certainly
would
be
freed
with
system
going
back
in
and
having
the
judge
re-instruct
the
jury
on
its
function,
would
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
one
way,
having
the
--
having
some
clarification,
if
not
purification,
of
the
jury
function.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
haven't
--
you
want
me
to
glancing
reference
to
the
power
of
the
senate
in
a
trial
of
an
impeachment
to
convict
by
a
two-thirds
vote.
do
you
read
into
that
expression
any
negation
of
the
--
or
any
reinforcement
of
the
idea
that
that's
related
to
mr.
madison's
unsuccessful
effort?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
hardly
any
crime
could
be
more
serious
than
the
impeachment
of
a
president
of
the
united
states
or
judge
chase's
impeachment
when
he
was
on
this
court
and
yet,
the
founding
fathers
were
willing
that
that
be
done
by
two-thirds?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
tanzer.
thank
you,
mr.
sobol.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
number
5046
apodaca
against
oregon.
mr.
sobol,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
allen
a
federal
state
or
a
state
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
and
was
not
the
court
addressing
itself
to
the
jury
system
as
then
established
by
acts
of
the
congress?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
court
was
certainly
aware
then
as
we
all
are
now
that
when
the
sixth
amendment
was
proposed,
it
was
proposed
to
have
the
unanimous
verdict.
was
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
justice
blackmun
suggested,
is
not
that
the
policy
argument
that
led
to,
was
either
four
or
six
of
the
states
of
the
original
13,
to
insist
upon
a
unanimous
verdict
provision
written
into
the
constitution.
is
it
not
that
--
are
you
not
arguing
the
policy
desirability?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
say
if
there
were
requirement
in
the
statute
of
louisiana
that
they
must
deliberate
6
hours
or
8
hours
before
they
could
return
in
less
than
unanimous
verdict,
would
that
satisfy
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
all
of
those
arguments
that
you
suggest
would
amend
themselves
to
persuading
the
states
and
federal
government
to
have
18
jurors
or
24
jurors
because
your
incidence
of
the
skeptical
juror
would
increase.
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
there
is
a
lack
of
public
confidence
in
oregon?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
sobol.
tanzer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
your
view
that
you
have
to
sustain
the
burden
of
proving
that
it
is
a
good
system
or
is
your
burden
merely
to
prove
that
the
federal
constitution
does
not
fit
any
restrictions
on
the
state?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
did
not
mean
to
limit
you
in
any
way.
i
just
want
to
be
sure
about
the
focus
of
the
case.
chief

e.
