any

justice

yes.
justice

and
the

so,
the

jury
cases
are
more

to
have
been
a
more

justice

right.
justice
byron

white
right.--
justice

right.
justice
byron

right,

so
that
when
you
get
a
9-3

10-2

the
odds
are
pretty
high
against
the

that's

justice

that's

that's
when
it
starts
out
that
--
justice

an
8-7
or
something.
justice

well,
if
it
starts
out
8-7
and
ends
up
--
and,
after
two
days
it's
9-3,
it's
probably
going

stay
there.
justice

if

9-3,
that's
a

justice

are
you
suggesting
that
the
real

here
is
the
accuracy

the
result

just
the
fact
that
there
might
be
more

less

more
or
fewer
convictions?
justice

do
you
think
there's
real
--
there's
some
connection
between
the
accuracy
and
how
many
convictions
there
are?
i
mean,
do
you
say
that
because
there
may
be
more
convictions
with
a
majority
verdict
that
the
verdicts
may
be
less
accurate?
justice
byron

the
proof
of
less
accuracy
just
doesn't
follow
from
the
fact
that

may
be
more

you
don't
