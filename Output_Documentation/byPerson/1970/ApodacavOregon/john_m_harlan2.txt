the
reason
why
i
believe
that
is
out
of
the
fact
that
everybody
who's
tried
the
case
knows,
in
some
instances,
the
jury
--
some
juror
become
the
person's
arbitrary
on
listening
and
what
not
and,
still,
our
law
tolerates
that
kind
of
power
in
individual
jurors.
justice
john
m.

so
you
can't
argue
that
with
such
a
broad
sweep,
can
you,
of
reasonable
doubt
premise?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
that
in
order
to
decide
this
case
in
your
favor
we
have
to
hold
that
the
sixth
amendment
in
federal
crimes
is
not
required?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
the
jury
reserved
this
question,
wouldn't
you
say,
that
no
more
to
protect
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
williams?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
justice
white's
opinion
didn't
do
anything
more
than
reserve
the
question
of
unanimity?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
do
you
think
we
can
decide
this
case
or
to
put
my

again?

what's
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
what's
that
first?

that's
deciding
the
question
for
the
federal
system.
justice
john
m.
harlan
by
a
state
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
we'll
have
a
regression
line
analysis.
