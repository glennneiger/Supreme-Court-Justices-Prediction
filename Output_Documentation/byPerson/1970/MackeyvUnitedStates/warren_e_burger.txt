the
case
on
for
argument
this
morning
is
mackey
against
the
united
states,
number
36.
mr.
ward,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
clarify
it
for
me
here,
just
what
compulsion
are
you
referring
to?
compulsion
on
whom
to
produce
what
consequence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it’s
true
of
all
of
us,
isn’t
it,
if
we
don’t
file
tax
returns?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
know
this
is
going
over
old
ground
perhaps,
but
it
might
help
me.
what
about
an
application
for
passport,
statement
and
an
application
for
a
passport?
no
one
is
required
to
apply
for
passport,
but
in
order
to
get
a
passport,
you
must
file
an
application.
would
you
think
that
the
statements
made
in
the
application
for
passport,
for
example,
or
anyone
of
many
other
similar
optional
areas
would
be
sheltered
by
the
same
--
protected
by
the
same
shield
of
the
fifth
amendment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
what
about
the
applications
for
government
employment
which
requires
many,
many
answers
and
that
is
accompanied
by
a
statute
making
it
a
felony,
to
give
a
false
answer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
for
testing
that
that
statute
just
someway
violates
the
fifth
amendment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it's
right
to
file
a
false
document
at
many
times
is
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
absent,
absent
the
statute.
is
there
any
inherent
right
to
filing
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
make
a
false
answer,
any
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
zinn.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
about
$28,000.00
a
year
is
what
he
was
reporting,
but
he
came
out
with
a
million
dollars
at
the
end.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
ward,
at
least
i
thought
i
heard
him
say
that
this
form
that
you
are
referring
to
now,
the
tax
on
wagering
is
a
scheme
of
federal
government
from
the
sole
purpose
of
forcing
people
to
disclose
their
illegal
activities.
did
i
hear
him
correctly
well?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
tax
is
10%
of
the
gross,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
something
it
looks
something
like
a
reverent
measure
i
should
think.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
you
have
made
your
case
if
you
had
merely
focused
on
the
deduction
taken
on
the
general
tax
return?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
ordinary,
is
regular
when
you
speak
of
income
tax
returns,
you’re
distinguishing
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
zinn,
let
me
be
sure
if
i
got
one
of
your
responses
to
justice
marshall
clear.
if
he
had
not
filed
the
wagering
tax
return,
could
he
have
taken
the
deduction
of
that
10%
each
year?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
he
got
a
very
substantial
benefit
out
of
filing
these
wagering
tax
returns?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
referring
to
the
requirement
for
example,
for
registering
a
gun
or
i
see
that
one
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
that
part
of
the
harmless
error?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
independent
of
sullivan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
can
march
one
more
minute
to
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
is
now
enlarged
to
five
minutes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
mentioned
that
i
think
three
times
now,
is
there
anything
remarkable
about
taking
not
many
days
to
review
a
case
that
has
865
exhibits?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
how
do
you
read
all
that
materials
in
much
less
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
at
that
time,
there
was
no
objections
made
to
the
introduction
of
the
wagering
tax
forms
on
the
fifth
amendment
grounds,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
have
one
now,
you
think?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
