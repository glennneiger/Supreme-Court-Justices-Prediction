justice
thurgood
marshall
but
mr.
zinn,
if
you
haven’t
filed
those,
it
would
never
put
on
his
income
tax.
he
would
never
claimed
the
tax
he
paid
on
his
income
tax.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
am
just
saying
that
on
his
income
tax,
he
claimed
deduction.
justice
thurgood
marshall
for
the
wagering
tax,
he
paid.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
would
assume
if
he
had
not
filed
and
paid
the
wagering
tax,
he
wouldn’t
have
made
that
deduction.
i
think
that’s
obvious,
isn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
can
you
go
along
with
the
thought
and
stretch
it
that
far
that
it
was
all
triggered
by
the
wagering
tax?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
assuming
he
did
not
take
the
deduction
which
i
think
is
an
assumption
against
fact
and
assume
that
he
didn’t,
he
should
then
have
been
able
to
been
able
to
put
the
wagering
tax?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
you
did
not
answer
that
he
still
would
need
it
for
the
gross
receipts.
justice
thurgood
marshall
don’t
get
too
far
and
get
these
two
tangled
up
together,
that’s
what
i
am
worried
about.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
one
of
the
same
piece
i
think
that
there
is
anything
by
getting
grosso
on
the
wagering
thing
and
you
drag
it
over
into
the
income
tax.
you
might
be
getting
some
fruits.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
mr.
ward,
what
about
the
claim
or
the
deduction
that
was
legitimately
an
evidence,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
maybe
he
made
a
specific
with
--
in
his
return,
you
said
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
income
tax.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
said
that
i
pay
the
tax
for
wages.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
all
you
have
to
do
is
one
part
of
a
10,
and
you
got
to
figure
out.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
find
any
fault
with
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
not
saying
it
lost.
but
if
you
pay
a
10%,
if
$1.00
is
10%
to
$10.00,
then
if
i
pay
$1.00
as
a
10%
tax,
i
earn
him
$10.00.
so
once
you
put
that
in
this
tax
return,
there
was
no
coercion
there
was.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
wouldn't
it
be
proper
for
the
prosecutor
to
argue
to
the
jury
you
quote
the
statute,
this
is
what
it
means,
we
multiply
it
by
10
and
we
have
got
that
much
of
admitted
gross
income.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
not
just
harmless
error
