mr.
william
m.
ward
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
comes
before
you
this
morning
in
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
it
was
commenced
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois,
hammond
division
within
approximately
two
weeks
of
this
court's
decisions
in
the
marchetti-grosso
cases.
the
petition
was
brought
under
28
u.s.c
2255
by
mr.
mackey
requesting
a
new
trial
from
a
conviction
of
willful
evasion
of
income
taxes.
the
gravamen
of
the
petition
was
that
during
the
course
of
the
income
tax
evasion
trial,
the
government
had
admitted
into
evidence
60
wagering
tax
returns
which
under
the
marchetti-grosso
decisions
were,
of
course,
taken
from
the
defendants
in
violation
of
its
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
the
petition
was
pending
for
approximately
eight
months.
no
answer
was
filed
by
the
government,
and
in
order
the
court
required
an
answer
to
the
petition.
briefs
were
submitted.
in
august
of
1968,
the
district
court
denied
the
petition
for
relief
under
2255
and
a
po
followed
to
the
united
states,
court
of
appeals
which
affirmed
and
petition
for
certiorari
was
granted
on
august
29,.1969
by
this
court.
the
facts
insofar
as
they
bear
upon
this
appeal
in
the
evasion
case
are
as
follows;
mr.
mackey
was
indicted
for
willful
evasion
of
taxes
for
the
years
1955
-
56
through
1960
inclusive.
the
trial
and
the
theory
of
the
government
in
the
evasion
case
was
a
pure
net
worth
case.
in
other
words,
there
were
no
specific
items
of
unreported
income
shown
by
the
government.
this
type
of
case
has
been
given
the
imprimatur
by
this
court
in
the
holland
and
friedberg
decisions.
during
the
course
of
this
trial,
the
government’s
offered
into
evidence
60
wagering
tax
returns
which
had
been
filed
by
mr.
mackey
monthly
during
the
years
in
question.
at
the
time
that
these
returns
were
offered
in
evidence,
the
district
court
trying
the
case
decided
that
they
were
prejudicial.
objection
was
made
to
their
admission
on
the
grounds
that
they
would
be
prejudicial
that
mr.
mackey
was
not
on
trial
for
being
a
gambler.
the
court
withheld
admitting
the
exhibits
into
evidence
until
the
future
time,
when
offered
again
upon
the
submission
by
the
government
that
these
were
needed
to
show
the
gross
income
from
gambling
during
the
years
in
question,
they
were
then
admitted
by
the
court
below.
at
the
close
of
the
government’s
case,
mr.
mackey
moved
for
acquittal.
he
was
denied.
mr.
mackey
then
rested.
the
case
was
given
at
the
jury.
the
jury
then
considered
the
case
for
approximately
43
hours
over
a
period
of
five
days,
but
in
a
judgment
of
conviction
which
was
affirmed
by
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari,
there
too
was
denied
by
this
court.
this
case
offers,
we
think
two
major
issues
to
the
court
at
this
time.
they
are
willis
decisions
and
marchetti-grosso
be
retroactively
applied
to
criminal
cases
which
were
tried
and
finalized
prior
to
the
date
of
these
decisions
and
secondly
and
i
think
personally
more
importantly
what
is
the
thrust
to
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
is
it
a
transactional
privilege
or
is
it
a
testimonial
privilege?
and
does
the
privilege
as
specifically
written
into
the
fifth
amendment
mean
exactly
what
it
says.
now,
as
far
as
the
retroactivity
part
of
this
case
is
concerned,
i
even
question
the
accuracy
of
the
word
retroactivity.
marchetti-grosso
where
decisions
of
this
court
which
i
feel
righted
a
wrong
in
the
kahriger
and
lewis
decisions.
marchetti-grosso
did
not
break
any
new
ground.
marchetti-grosso
said
and
i
think
reaffirmed
and
reaffirmed
as
it
should
have
reaffirmed
that
the
government,
the
national
government,
the
same
as
the
state
government
has
no
part
to
compel
testimony
or
compel
evidence
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
citizen
if
the
purpose
of
this
compulsion
is
to
provide
evidence
to
be
used
against
him
criminal
prosecutions.
this
court
i
think
universally
and
constantly
has
held
in
any
retroactivity
case
before
it,
relative
to
state
matters
that
where
the
element
of
compulsion
is
present,
where
statements
or
where
confessions
are
taken
from
a
defendant
through
compulsion
and
used
against
him
in
a
criminal
proceeding
at
any
time,
he
may
thereafter
move
for
a
new
trial
or
take
whatever
steps
are
necessary
to
afford
him
a
new
trial.
i
think
what’s
before
the
court
this
morning
is
this,
is
the
standard
which
this
court
has
imposed
upon
the
states
to
be
imposed
upon
the
national
government.
and
quite
frankly
upon
this
court,
i
think
if
this
matter
would
have
arisen
in
the
state
or
in
the
state
court
or
relative
to
state
legislation,
i
don’t
think
there’d
be
any
problems
in
the
court
saying
that
once
you
find
compulsion
and
if
i
may
use
one
of
mr.
justice
stewart’s
phrases
in
dissent.
compulsion
is
the
focus
of
the
inquiry.
once
you
find
compulsion,
once
you
find
a
compelled
statement
being
use
against
a
person
in
a
criminal
trial,
then
retroactivity
or
a
new
trial
automatically
follows.
mr.
william
m.
ward
if
mr.
mackey
had
not
filed
these
returns,
he
could
have
been
indicted
for
failure
to
file
a
return
and
could
have
been
sentenced
to
the
penitentiary
for
five
years
and
could
have
been
fined
$1,000.00
for
each
offense.
mr.
william
m.
ward
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct
and
that’s
the
difference
actually
between
the
sullivan
case
and
between
this
case.
in
the
sullivan
case,
this
court
specifically
held
that
a
return
which
was
required
from
all
of
the
people
and
for
the
purposes
of
raising
revenue,
certainly
was
not
sheltered
by
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
justice
holmes,
then
however
suggested
that
if
any
particular
part
of
that
return,
any
particular
question
in
that
return
would
tend
to
violate
the
privilege
and
of
course
the
privilege
could
be
claimed
in
the
return,
the
difference
is
in
the
marchetti-grosso
situation
at
least
as
i
read
the
two
decisions
and
as
the
lower
courts
who
seem
to
following
it
as
i
suggest
them
to
read
decisions,
the
court
held
specifically
that
these
returns
were
not
required
from
a
general
class
of
people
for
general
governmental
purpose.
i
think
this
court
held
specifically
that
these
returns
were
required
from
gamblers
in
order
to
provide
evidence
to
prosecute
gamblers.
that
i
think
is
the
gravamen
of
the
case.
mr.
william
m.
ward
in
the
first
instance,
no.
if
the
law
requiring
the
passport
or
if
the
law
requiring
the
filing
of
some
other
hypothetical
document
is
directed
towards
the
populist
or
the
citizens
at
large.
for
a
illegitimate
government
purpose,
in
other
words,
there’s
no
filing
at
the
purpose
of
this
legislation
was
specifically
to
obtain
evidence
to
be
used
against
a
narrow
class
of
people
in
criminal
prosecutions.
but
if
it
were
as
passport’s
law
are
directed
to
the
public
at
large,
certainly
i
think
you
would
be
required
to
file
an
application
for
a
passport.
now,
if
there
were
something
in
that
passport
application
which
may
tend
to
incriminate
you,
then
i
think
yes,
you
have
probably
a
serious
constitutional
question.
you
got
the
problem
of
whether
in
asking
for
a
passport,
the
government
can
either
compel
you
to
waive
your
privilege
against
the
self-incrimination
or
make
the
claiming
of
the
privilege
costly.
and
i
think
on
that
basis,
you
might
have
to
take
it
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
mr.
william
m.
ward
well
--
mr.
william
m.
ward
of
course,
if
you
file
a
false
answer,
i
think
the
court
has
decided
that
decision
just
last
month
in
the
--
i
mean
last
fall
in
the
cases
and
(inaudible)
within
this
area
that
we
are
in.
if
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
certainly
does
not
protect
you
against
filing
a
false
document,
this
court
has
so
held.
mr.
william
m.
ward
not
if
it’s
a
felony
to
so
file
it.
no,
i
think
this
court
held
that
--
mr.
william
m.
ward
a
false
document?
mr.
william
m.
ward
inherent
right
to
file
a
false
answer?
i
would
say
--
no.
i
would
say
no.
you’ve
got
18,
1001
staring
in
the
face
no
matter
anytime
you
file
a
document
with
the
national
government.
it’s
just
a
felony
to
file
a
false
document
with
the
national
government.
i
think
as
a
practical
matter
anytime
you
file
a
false
document
with
any
agency
of
the
federal
government,
you
got
a
felony
staring
in
the
face.
but
to
the
extent
going
back
to
your
employment
provision,
to
the
extent
that
an
employment
application
again
is
a
document
which
is
directed
at
all
people,
which
is
directed
towards
everyone,
you
don’t
--
at
the
threshold
meet
the
problem
that
you
meet
in
marchetti-grosso.
this
would
not
be
per
se
a
violation
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
to
the
extent
that
anything
was
in
there,
any
question
or
answer
was
required
which
may
incriminate
you,
then
you
get
into
this
question
of,
do
you
have
a
right
to
federal
employment
and
can
they
compel
you
to
waive
the
privilege
and
again,
you
may
have
a
problem.
i
don’t
profess
to
be
able
to
specifically
answer,
but
you
may
have
a
problem
on
the
facts.
but
i
think
this
marchetti-grosso
situation
goes
one
step
further
because
we
have
a
specific,
direct
finding
by
this
court
that
the
statutes
themselves
where
aimed
at
a
small
class
of
people
for
the
purposes
of
getting
information
to
prosecute
the
small
class
of
people.
i
think
that
is
settled
by
marchetti-grosso
and
i
think
the
lower
courts
have
so
held.
for
example,
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
nucio
case,
vacated
a
conviction
upon
a
plea
guilty
on
the
grounds
that
protecting
integrity
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
has
done
the
same
thing
last
month.
they
have
held
marchetti-grosso
retroactive.
they
have
held
that
the
harmless
error
rule
doesn’t
apply.
they
attempted
to
distinguish
the
mackey
case,
but
they
also
have
had
held
that
to
protect
the
integrity,
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
prosecutions
under
the
statute
and
land
and
the
basic
thrust
of
it
is
the
rational
of
marchetti-grosso
has
found
in
those
decisions
from
this
court.
mr.
william
m.
ward
that
is
correct.
in
order
to
pay
the
tax,
the
tax
is
paid
monthly
upon
gross
receipts.
it
is
not
an
income
tax,
it’s
an
excise
tax.
in
order
to
pay
the
tax,
you
have
to
file
a
return
monthly.
mr.
william
m.
ward
right.
now
the
reasons
for
putting
these
in
were
two-fold:
one
and
i
think
this
is
admitted
by
the
government,
it’s
always
been
admitted
by
the
government
to
show
that
he
was
a
gambler.
they
had
to
show
he
was
a
gambler.
they
had
to
show
that
he
likely
source
of
unreported
income.
mr.
william
m.
ward
precisely,
and
if
this
court
is
held
both
in
friedberg
and
holland
that
this
is
an
absolute
necessity
in
such
a
case
because
they
are
purely
totally,
solely
circumstantial
evidence
cases.
now,
the
prosecutor
then
went
onto
say,
he
needed
it
for
another
reason.
he
needed
those
figures.
he
had
to
show
that
those
figures
--
he
had
to
get
those
figures
into
evidence
and
right
after
these
returns
are
put
into
evidence,
mr.
harrington
then
testified
from
one
of
his
graphs,
exhibit
765
showing
the
total
gross
receipts
from
gambling.
now
the
reason
that
those
total
--
that
the
prosecutor
said
he
needed
those
total
gross
receipts
from
gambling
to
show
that
he
had
a
greater
income
from
gambling,
than
shown
in
his
schedule
c-returns.
in
other
words,
in
evidence
in
this
case
was
schedule
c
returns
a
showed
income
from
“policy”
and
i
think
one
returns
had
policy
wheel,
the
man
paid
his
income
tax
and
his
wagering
income.
but
the
government
argued
i
have
got
to
show
that
he
had
a
greater
income
from
gambling
than
showed
on
schedule
c.
so
i
not
only
need
those
wagering
tax
returns
to
show
that
he
was
a
gambler,
i
need
him
for
the
figures.
and
so
he
argued
to
the
jury.
he
so
argued
to
the
jury
on
four
different
occasions.
i
think
this
is
--
as
far
as
the
importance
of
these
returns
are
concerned
with
the
government,
i
think
the
prosecutor
summing
up
argument
is
almost
the
key
here.
this
was
a
long
trial
and
all
net
worth
trials
are
long
trials.
i
think
they
were
over
800
exhibits,
pieces
of
paper
put
into
the
evidence
in
this
trial.
the
reason
being
is
because
the
key
testimony
in
a
net
worth
trial
is
the
government’s
expert.
he
has
the
expert
exhibit
and
of
course
the
foundation
has
to
be
laid
to
support
everything
in
the
exhibit.
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
there
were
800
exhibits
or
an
excess
of
800
exhibits
and
that
they
key
exhibit
in
the
net
worth
case
is
the
file
net
worth
summary
by
the
prosecutor,
that
was
mentioned
to
the
jury
six
times
and
rightfully
so
you’d
expect
it.
the
next
amount
of
time
as
far
as
any
exhibit
was
mentioned
to
the
jury
was
these
wagering
tax
returns.
four
different
times,
the
prosecutor
came
back
to
these
wagering
tax
returns
and
one
of
them
in
effect
was
very
interested.
it
was
almost
a
griffin
type
case
and
these
are
said
out
in
our
reply
brief.
he
said
to
the
jury
if
these
wagering
tax
returns
are
accurate,
if
they
truly
reflect
the
ins
and
the
outs,
then
they’re
okay,
but
there
is
only
one
man
that
can
tell
us.
mr.
mackey.
come
up,
waive
your
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
explain
this.
mr.
william
m.
ward
the
government
never
took
that
position
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
william
m.
ward
i
don’t
know.
they
simply
--
implicit
in
the
jury’s
verdict
has
to
be
one
of
two
things
that
didn’t
believe
the
wagering
tax
returns
because
the
net
worth
bulge
was
larger
than
the
wagering
tax
return.
or
implicit
in
the
jury’s
verdict,
this
confusion,
confusion
that
those
wagering
tax
return
represented
taxable
income.
mr.
william
m.
ward
right.
but
see,
not
being
and
not
taking
the
stand,
mr.
mackey
didn’t
have
the
chance
of
explaining
it.
we
don’t
know
for
a
fact
that
the
jury
knew
these
were
gross
receipts.
in
other
words,
if
you
add
up
the
wagering
tax
returns
as
exhibit
765
did,
you
find
it
in
enormously
greater
figure
of
income
from
wagering
than
you
did
on
the
scheduled
c
upon
which
taxes
were
paid.
it’s
within
the
round
of
possibility
and
quite
frankly,
i
personally
believe
that
that’s
what
the
jury
found.
mr.
william
m.
ward
we
did.
but
after
43
hours,
we
have
no
idea
exactly
what
the
jury
ultimately
did
find.
mr.
william
m.
ward
in
that
particular
area?
i
don’t
know
what
else.
quite
frankly
mr.
justice,
i
don’t
know
what
else
he
put
on,
but
i
do
know
that
an
income,
one
place
he
had
in
four
years,
i
think
just
the
word
policy.
and
on
the
50-year,
he
had
the
word
policy
wheel,
plus
other
--
mr.
william
m.
ward
one
of
the
sources
of
income,
yes.
mr.
william
m.
ward
yes
sir.
mr.
william
m.
ward
to
my
knowledge
and
i
know
i’m
correct
in
this.
i
never
use
the
word
gambler.
he
never
used
the
word
gambler.
mr.
william
m.
ward
as
far
as
his
occupation
is
concerned?
it
could
have
been
insurance.
he
was
a
president
of
two
insurance
companies
and
the
mw
investment
--
i
can
argue
inferentially
that
he
never
did
because
of
the
argument
made
by
the
prosecutor
to
the
jury
and
show
he
was
a
gambler
and
the
argument
made
to
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
the
appeal
in
the
original
case.
the
government
is
admitted
here
that
the
only
evidence
of
gambling
that
the
wagering
tax
returns
and
to
some
extent
the
word
policy
or
policy
wheel
in
the
income
tax
returns.
but
again,
as
to
the
weight
given
to
that
and
the
argument
to
the
jury,
the
prosecutor
never
argued.
never
argued
that
you
could
find
that
this
man
was
a
gambler
because
of
what
he
put
in
his
scheduled
c’s.
four
times
the
prosecutor
argued
to
the
jury,
this
man
is
a
gambler
because
of
the
wagering
tax
returns
and
they
so
argued
that
in
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals.
so
it
seems
a
bit
of
a
late
date
to
come
in
here
and
try
in
a
sense
to
change
the
facts.
and
of
course,
to
me,
the
key
aspect
to
that
is
the
district
judge
in
the
2255
proceedings.
the
district
judge
in
these
2255
proceedings
tried
this
case
and
when
this
petition
was
filed
in
his
opinion,
he
said
this
represents
a
new
and
serious
question.
he
specifically
said
in
his
memorandum
opinion
that
these
returns
were
put
in
to
show
a
likely
source
of
unreported
income.
and
i
think
that
to
me
is
practically
decisive
as
far
as
how
important
these
returns
were
to
the
government
on
a
trial,
the
district
judge
in
these
proceedings
considered
them
extremely
important.
in
its
memorandum
opinion,
in
its
decision,
this
case
was
on
the
law,
not
on
the
facts,
but
on
the
law.
mr.
william
m.
ward
no
i
think
under
the
sullivan
case
mr.
justice
in
candor,
i
think
under
the
sullivan
case
having
put
something
into
schedule
c,
you
waived
the
privilege.
as
far
as
schedule
c
is
concerned,
i
think
--
mr.
william
m.
ward
yes,
plus
his
source.
mr.
william
m.
ward
yes
sir.
mr.
william
m.
ward
the
ins
and
outs
situation,
no
sir.
he
just
as
far
as
my
recollection
is
concerned,
all
he
did
was
--
mr.
william
m.
ward
the
net
figure,
the
taxable
income
figure.
mr.
william
m.
ward
no,
no
sir.
mr.
william
m.
ward
well,
the
sullivan
case
pretty
much
teaches
you
that.
the
sullivan
case
says
that
the
income
tax
return
must
be
filed
and
if
there
is
anything
specific
within
the
return
that
would
validate
--
mr.
william
m.
ward
no,
no
sir
because
i
think
there
was
a
particular
finding
here
and
this
case
mentioned
sullivan
and
distinguished
it
in
marchetti-grosso.
mr.
william
m.
ward
except
under
sullivan.
mr.
william
m.
ward
they
can
demand
the
source
of
--
or
they
can
demand
the
income
figures,
yes.
sullivan
specifically
holds
and
i
think
sullivan
is
still
the
law
that
if
any
source
of
income
information
would
in
any
way
incriminate
you,
then
you
can
claim
the
privilege.
mr.
william
m.
ward
in
the
income
tax
returns,
no
sir,
no
sir.
but
there
is
no
as
i
say
the
income
tax
returns,
there
is
no
statement
that
he
was
a
gambler,
there
was
this
policy
and
policy
wheel.
but
again
as
i
pointed
out
in
the
reply,
if
this
were
enough
to
go
to
the
jury
and
i
personally
don’t
think
it
would
have
been
fair
comments
to
go
to
the
jury
with
these
schedule
c’s
and
say
that
this
shows
the
man
is
a
gambler
and
has
a
likely
source
of
unreported
income,
there
are
two
big
insurance
companies
involved
there.
mr.
william
m.
ward
but
he
didn’t.
he
could’ve
but
he
didn’t.
four
times
he
went
back
to
the
jury
and
he
said
here
is
your
likely
source
of
unreported
income.
mr.
downing
wants
a
likely
source
of
unreported
income
here
it
is,
and
another
occasion
he
said
one
of
the
witnesses
testified
that
mr.
mackey
never
had
that
kind
of
money,
never
had
that
kind
of
money.
do
you
want
to
see
where
he
had
that
kind
of
money?
take
a
look
at
the
schedules,
the
wagering
tax.
four
times
he
went
back
to
those,
four
times.
i
think
they
were
extremely
important
to
the
prosecutor
and
being
extremely
important
to
the
prosecutor,
they
were
important
--
he
fought
something
like
two
weeks
to
get
these
into
evidence
and
even
the
judge
at
an
evidentiary
objection,
at
an
evidentiary
objection
said
they
were
somewhat
inflammatory,
didn’t
want
to
leave
them
in,
and
then
decided
to
leave
them
in,
not
so
much
into
the
issue
of
gambling
but
they
contained
figures
that
the
government
said
was
absolutely
necessary
to
their
case.
the
gross
income
figure
is
just
the
gambling.
now,
if
they
weren't
important,
then
the
o’connell
case
would
have
taken
over.
there
was
a
specific
ruling
in
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
that
returns
that
characterized
the
man
a
gambler
if
not
relevant
to
the
case
with
prejudicial
and
reversible
error.
so
i
just
don’t
think
the
government
can
have
it
two
ways
to
have
one
point
convince
the
judge
at
the
trial
level
that
these
are
relevant
and
extremely
important
and
must
go
in
and
then
on
the
appellant
level
hearsay,
they
weren’t
very
important,
they
weren’t
very
relevant
and
we
didn’t
really
need
them
because
if
that
were
the
case,
this
case
should
have
been
reversed
the
first
time
around
on
the
issue
of
ricardo.
then
we
get
into
the
nature
of
the
privilege
itself,
the
transactional
testimonial.
the
government
is
argued
that
because
marchetti-grosso
specifically
talked
about
gamblers,
but
this
is
not
a
gambling
prosecution
and
therefore,
the
thrust
of
the
decision
should
not
go
to
this
type
of
a
situation.
i
think
the
privilege
itself,
no
person
in
a
criminal
prosecution
should
be
a
witness
against
themselves
answers
the
question.
i
think
once
the
privilege
is
violated
and
this
court
has
specifically
ruled
that
the
privilege
was
violated
in
the
marchetti-grosso
situation.
once
the
privilege
is
violated,
that
taints
the
evidence.
i
can’t
conceive
of
it
being
in
use
of
another
prosecution.
i
can’t
conceive
of
this
court
holding
or
stating
that
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
can
be
violated
and
there
are
some
circumstances
in
which
the
evidence
could
be
used
in
a
criminal
prosecution
against
the
witness.
to
me
in
any
event
is
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
if
you
go
back
to
the
silverthorne
lumber
case,
this
court
held
that
the
essence
of
a
provision
which
prohibits
the
acquisition
of
evidence
is
not
only
that
the
evidence
not
be
used
in
court,
but
that
it
not
be
used
at
all.
you
get
into
the
murphy
v
the
waterfront
commission
state,
a
silver
platter
sort
of
a
thing
where
the
court
held
that
if
evidence
be
taken
on
the
state
level
in
violation
of
a
witnesses's
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
it
may
not
be
used
in
any
manner,
in
any
manner,
these
are
the
words
of
this
court
in
a
criminal
prosecution
by
the
federal
government
against
the
witness.
the
gardner
case
reaffirmed,
just
i
think
a
year
or
two
ago,
reaffirmed
the
murphy
v
waterfront
commission
in
that
situation
and
i
would
like
to
spend
a
second
with
the
gardner
case
because
i
think
it
has
some
relevance
to
this
case.
the
gardner
case
was
a
police
officer
who
lost
his
job
because
he
refused
to
surrender
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
he
wouldn’t
sign
a
waiver
of
immunity.
a
year
and
a
half
later,
this
court
decided
the
garrity
v.
new
jersey
case
said
they
couldn’t
do
that
to
him,
couldn’t
make
the
imposition
of
the
penalty
costly.
he
then
filed
a
petition
for
reinstatement
for
his
job
which
was
denied
and
the
case
worked
itself
up
and
that
this
court
ultimately
decided
that
he
should
get
his
job
back
but
his
privilege
was
a
violated.
in
other
words,
in
a
civil
manner,
this
court
had
no
problem
with
making
garrity
retroactive
to
a
set
of
facts
that
happened
a
year
and
a
half
before
where
a
man
had
lost
his
property,
his
job
if
you
will
because
of
a
violations
privilege.
it
just
seems
to
me
in
a
criminal
manner,
in
a
criminal
case
where
a
man
has
been
convicted
in
a
very
important
link
of
the
chain
of
evidence
needed
to
convict
is
a
part
of
the
conviction
process
that
he
has
a
right
to
a
new
trial
on
the
same
basis
that
garrity
or
gardner
had
the
right
to
his
job.
so
as
far
as
this
court
i
think
persistently
and
continuously
held
that
once
the
privilege
has
been
violated
that
the
evidence
cannot
be
used
in
any
manner
against
the
witnessed,
it
is
always
held,
at
least
i
read
the
case
as
far
as
state
prosecutions
are
concerned,
and
it
is
always
been
extremely
careful
and
talking
in
particularly
in
retroactivity
cases.
in
talking
for
example,
that
the
miranda
rule
should
be
prospectively
applied,
the
escobedo
rule
should
be
prospectively
apply.
it
always
been
extremely
careful
to
iterate
and
reiterate
and
continue
to
carve
out
this
exception
that
where
it
a
shown
that
a
statement
is
taken
from
a
witness
involuntarily
and
used
against
him,
then
he
still
has
the
right
at
anytime
to
avail
himself
at
any
state
or
federal
machinery
for
bringing
this
to
the
attention
of
the
court
and
getting
the
appropriate
relief
which
is
exactly
what
we
have
done
here.
i
believe,
i
still
have
four
minutes
mr.
chief
justice.
i
like
to
save
them
if
i
may.
mr.
william
m.
ward
mr.
chief
justice,
on
many
occasions,
the
assistant
solicitor
general
said
that
is
not
the
case
and
that
is
quite
true.
the
case
he
argued
on
the
facts
here
is
not
the
case
that
existed
in
the
criminal
trial.
he
is
arguing
basically
is
we
should
have
won.
he
is
arguing
that
the
court
was
wrong,
that
this
evidence
should
not
come
in,
there
are
objections
to
the
evidence
at
the
time
we
made
it
were
proper
and
correct,
and
of
course
i
agree
with
him.
the
problem
is
we
lost
the
argument
and
the
evidence
was
admitted
against
us,
and
it
was
used
against
us.
and
i
think
to
the
effect
that
it
was
used
against
us,
i
refer
the
court
to
page
16
and
17
of
our
reply
with
a
prosecutor
having
gotten
that
evidence
in,
relied
on
it,
immensely
before
the
jury.
it
was
the
second
most
important
part
of
his
argument
to
the
jury.
this
is
what
we
are
talking
about.
how
did
this
affect
the
jury
out
43
hours
for
five
days?
that
is
exactly
what
we
are
talking
about.
mr.
william
m.
ward
i
think
so,
yes
sir.
i
think
that
is
a
long
time
for
a
jury
to
be
out,
yes
sir.
i
think
it
is
a
very
long
time
for
the
jury
to
(voice
overlap).
mr.
william
m.
ward
well,
i
question
how
much
they
really
-
they
might
have
read
it
a
quite
number
and
quite
a
lot
of
it
was
foundation
evidence,
evidence
that
didn’t
necessarily
had
to
be
read
but
had
to
be
in
for
the
purposes
of
providing
the
foundation
for
the
exhibit
evidence.
so
i
think
that
is
a
long
time
to
be
out,
yes
sir.
as
far
as
the
million
dollar
net
worth
case,
i
am
not
too
sure
it’s
before
this
court
but
i
would
like
to
refer
in
the
large
appendix
that
was
filed,
government’s
exhibit
800
property
held
in
the
name
of
gibraltar
industrial
life
insurance
company.
in
other
words,
i
don't
take
too
much
time
on
this,
approximately
$1
million
in
assets,
held
in
the
names
of
regulated
insurance
companies,
under
the
control
of
the
director
of
insurance
in
the
state
of
indiana
makes
up
that
bulge.
that
is
one
of
the
big
arguments
in
the
case,
but
that
was
an
argument
in
the
case
of
the
original
level
and
would
be
on
retrial.
it
certainly
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
which
is
before
this
court
right
now.
on
the
harmless
error
doctrine,
i
do
want
to
make
this
point.
i
want
to
make
it
strongly.
the
constitution
says,
the
fifth
amendment
says,
no
person
shall
be
a
witness
against
himself
on
a
criminal
prosecution.
it
does
not
say
that
no
person
shall
be
a
witness
against
himself
in
a
criminal
prosecution
except
he
can
be
compelled
to
have
testimony
admitted
against
him,
if
later
is
found
to
be
harmless
error.
the
harmless
error
in
the
constitutional
rulings,
the
harrington
and
the
chapman
situations
usually
at
least
as
i
read
them
come
up
on
fourth
amendment
situations
or
confrontation
situations.
the
constitution
does
not
prohibit
searches
and
seizures.
it
prohibits
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
and
the
constitution
requires
confrontation
but
it
doesn’t
necessarily,
specifically
prohibit
evidence
which
would
go
in,
in
a
trial
without
confrontation.
these
rules
have
exclusion
or
judge
made
rules
and
i
think
there
can
be
a
further
emendation
on
these
of
harmless
error,
but
the
constitution
specifically
says,
no
person
shall
be
a
witness
against
himself
in
a
criminal
proceeding
and
mr.
mackey
was
a
witness
against
himself
in
a
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
william
m.
ward
well,
that
was
the
claim
i
believe
of
the
mr.
mackey’s
defense
lawyer
at
trial
that
all
of
the
evidence
--
mr.
william
m.
ward
are
we
talking
about
the
wagering
tax
return
mr.
justice
or
the
--
mr.
william
m.
ward
income
tax
return.
mr.
william
m.
ward
correct.
mr.
william
m.
ward
that
is
what
the
defense
lawyer
argued.
that
is
--
mr.
william
m.
ward
i
think
you
should
have
wanted
at
the
time,
yes,
but
having
lost
it
having
lost
the
argument.
mr.
william
m.
ward
in
the
wagering
tax
return?
mr.
william
m.
ward
in
the
income
--
no,
there
was
no
coercion
there.
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
m.
ward
he
could
have,
yes.
but
he
didn’t.
that’s
why
i
say
the
case
as
it
existed
below
--
mr.
william
m.
ward
no,
i
think
not
because
i
think
that
you
cannot
have
a
person
testify
against
himself.
the
only
thing
i
can
rely
on
mr.
justice
is
the
prosecutor’s
actions
in
the
court
below.
he
denied
that
argument.
he
told
the
judge
that
that
was
not
a
valid
argument.
he
told
the
judge
he
absolutely
needed
these
figures
from
these
returns
and
the
judge
agreed
with
him.
the
judge
agreed
with
them,
said
these
returns
must
go
in
and
then
he
argued
to
the
jury
from
these
returns.
i
can
only
argue
the
cases
that
happened
below.
these
were
used
and
they
were
used
very
violently
against
the
petitioner.
mr.
william
m.
ward
that
is
correct
your
honor.
i
think
the
solicitor
general,
as
far
as
i
understand
is
the
man
on
this
point
now.
they
haven’t
raised
the
question
of
waive.
they
waived
it
and
raised
it
in
the
seventh
circuit
but
they
necessarily
have
not
raised
that
here.
of
course,
our
position
is
we
had
no
privilege.
kahriger
and
lewis
had
taken
that
privilege
away.
it
wasn’t
a
question
of
something
we
didn’t
know,
it
isn't
a
question
of
something
that
the
--
on
the
state
--
we
had
no
privilege.
we
had
no
privilege.
mr.
william
m.
ward
yes,
yes.
i
again,
i
just
go
back
to
the
fact
that
i
think
marchetti-grosso
righted
a
wrong.
kahriger
and
lewis
were
bad
long.
marchetti-grosso
so
held.
mr.
william
m.
ward
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
the
parts
that
i
thought
were
important
are
in
the
reply
put
on
the
(inaudible)
in
the
reply.
the
full
summations
will
be
found
in
volume
four
of
the
appellant’s
appendix
in
the
original
trial
which
was
filed
in
this
court
when
i
filed
the
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
william
m.
ward
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
comes
before
you
this
morning
in
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
it
was
commenced
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois,
hammond
division
within
approximately
two
weeks
of
this
court's
decisions
in
the
marchetti-grosso
cases.
the
petition
was
brought
under
28
u.s.c
2255
by
mr.
mackey
requesting
a
new
trial
from
a
conviction
of
willful
evasion
of
income
taxes.
the
gravamen
of
the
petition
was
that
during
the
course
of
the
income
tax
evasion
trial,
the
government
had
admitted
into
evidence
60
wagering
tax
returns
which
under
the
marchetti-grosso
decisions
were,
of
course,
taken
from
the
defendants
in
violation
of
its
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
the
petition
was
pending
for
approximately
eight
months.
no
answer
was
filed
by
the
government,
and
in
order
the
court
required
an
answer
to
the
petition.
briefs
were
submitted.
in
august
of
1968,
the
district
court
denied
the
petition
for
relief
under
2255
and
a
po
followed
to
the
united
states,
court
of
appeals
which
affirmed
and
petition
for
certiorari
was
granted
on
august
29,.1969
by
this
court.
the
facts
insofar
as
they
bear
upon
this
appeal
in
the
evasion
case
are
as
follows;
mr.
mackey
was
indicted
for
willful
evasion
of
taxes
for
the
years
1955
-
56
through
1960
inclusive.
the
trial
and
the
theory
of
the
government
in
the
evasion
case
was
a
pure
net
worth
case.
in
other
words,
there
were
no
specific
items
of
unreported
income
shown
by
the
government.
this
type
of
case
has
been
given
the
imprimatur
by
this
court
in
the
holland
and
friedberg
decisions.
during
the
course
of
this
trial,
the
government’s
offered
into
evidence
60
wagering
tax
returns
which
had
been
filed
by
mr.
mackey
monthly
during
the
years
in
question.
at
the
time
that
these
returns
were
offered
in
evidence,
the
district
court
trying
the
case
decided
that
they
were
prejudicial.
objection
was
made
to
their
admission
on
the
grounds
that
they
would
be
prejudicial
that
mr.
mackey
was
not
on
trial
for
being
a
gambler.
the
court
withheld
admitting
the
exhibits
into
evidence
until
the
future
time,
when
offered
again
upon
the
submission
by
the
government
that
these
were
needed
to
show
the
gross
income
from
gambling
during
the
years
in
question,
they
were
then
admitted
by
the
court
below.
at
the
close
of
the
government’s
case,
mr.
mackey
moved
for
acquittal.
he
was
denied.
mr.
mackey
then
rested.
the
case
was
given
at
the
jury.
the
jury
then
considered
the
case
for
approximately
43
hours
over
a
period
of
five
days,
but
in
a
judgment
of
conviction
which
was
affirmed
by
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari,
there
too
was
denied
by
this
court.
this
case
offers,
we
think
two
major
issues
to
the
court
at
this
time.
they
are
willis
decisions
and
marchetti-grosso
be
retroactively
applied
to
criminal
cases
which
were
tried
and
finalized
prior
to
the
date
of
these
decisions
and
secondly
and
i
think
personally
more
importantly
what
is
the
thrust
to
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
is
it
a
transactional
privilege
or
is
it
a
testimonial
privilege?
and
does
the
privilege
as
specifically
written
into
the
fifth
amendment
mean
exactly
what
it
says.
now,
as
far
as
the
retroactivity
part
of
this
case
is
concerned,
i
even
question
the
accuracy
of
the
word
retroactivity.
marchetti-grosso
where
decisions
of
this
court
which
i
feel
righted
a
wrong
in
the
kahriger
and
lewis
decisions.
marchetti-grosso
did
not
break
any
new
ground.
marchetti-grosso
said
and
i
think
reaffirmed
and
reaffirmed
as
it
should
have
reaffirmed
that
the
government,
the
national
government,
the
same
as
the
state
government
has
no
part
to
compel
testimony
or
compel
evidence
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
citizen
if
the
purpose
of
this
compulsion
is
to
provide
evidence
to
be
used
against
him
criminal
prosecutions.
this
court
i
think
universally
and
constantly
has
held
in
any
retroactivity
case
before
it,
relative
to
state
matters
that
where
the
element
of
compulsion
is
present,
where
statements
or
where
confessions
are
taken
from
a
defendant
through
compulsion
and
used
against
him
in
a
criminal
proceeding
at
any
time,
he
may
thereafter
move
for
a
new
trial
or
take
whatever
steps
are
necessary
to
afford
him
a
new
trial.
i
think
what’s
before
the
court
this
morning
is
this,
is
the
standard
which
this
court
has
imposed
upon
the
states
to
be
imposed
upon
the
national
government.
and
quite
frankly
upon
this
court,
i
think
if
this
matter
would
have
arisen
in
the
state
or
in
the
state
court
or
relative
to
state
legislation,
i
don’t
think
there’d
be
any
problems
in
the
court
saying
that
once
you
find
compulsion
and
if
i
may
use
one
of
mr.
justice
stewart’s
phrases
in
dissent.
compulsion
is
the
focus
of
the
inquiry.
once
you
find
compulsion,
once
you
find
a
compelled
statement
being
use
against
a
person
in
a
criminal
trial,
then
retroactivity
or
a
new
trial
automatically
follows.
mr.
william
m.
ward
if
mr.
mackey
had
not
filed
these
returns,
he
could
have
been
indicted
for
failure
to
file
a
return
and
could
have
been
sentenced
to
the
penitentiary
for
five
years
and
could
have
been
fined
$1,000.00
for
each
offense.
mr.
william
m.
ward
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct
and
that’s
the
difference
actually
between
the
sullivan
case
and
between
this
case.
in
the
sullivan
case,
this
court
specifically
held
that
a
return
which
was
required
from
all
of
the
people
and
for
the
purposes
of
raising
revenue,
certainly
was
not
sheltered
by
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
justice
holmes,
then
however
suggested
that
if
any
particular
part
of
that
return,
any
particular
question
in
that
return
would
tend
to
violate
the
privilege
and
of
course
the
privilege
could
be
claimed
in
the
return,
the
difference
is
in
the
marchetti-grosso
situation
at
least
as
i
read
the
two
decisions
and
as
the
lower
courts
who
seem
to
following
it
as
i
suggest
them
to
read
decisions,
the
court
held
specifically
that
these
returns
were
not
required
from
a
general
class
of
people
for
general
governmental
purpose.
i
think
this
court
held
specifically
that
these
returns
were
required
from
gamblers
in
order
to
provide
evidence
to
prosecute
gamblers.
that
i
think
is
the
gravamen
of
the
case.
mr.
william
m.
ward
in
the
first
instance,
no.
if
the
law
requiring
the
passport
or
if
the
law
requiring
the
filing
of
some
other
hypothetical
document
is
directed
towards
the
populist
or
the
citizens
at
large.
for
a
illegitimate
government
purpose,
in
other
words,
there’s
no
filing
at
the
purpose
of
this
legislation
was
specifically
to
obtain
evidence
to
be
used
against
a
narrow
class
of
people
in
criminal
prosecutions.
but
if
it
were
as
passport’s
law
are
directed
to
the
public
at
large,
certainly
i
think
you
would
be
required
to
file
an
application
for
a
passport.
now,
if
there
were
something
in
that
passport
application
which
may
tend
to
incriminate
you,
then
i
think
yes,
you
have
probably
a
serious
constitutional
question.
you
got
the
problem
of
whether
in
asking
for
a
passport,
the
government
can
either
compel
you
to
waive
your
privilege
against
the
self-incrimination
or
make
the
claiming
of
the
privilege
costly.
and
i
think
on
that
basis,
you
might
have
to
take
it
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
mr.
william
m.
ward
well
--
mr.
william
m.
ward
of
course,
if
you
file
a
false
answer,
i
think
the
court
has
decided
that
decision
just
last
month
in
the
--
i
mean
last
fall
in
the
cases
and
(inaudible)
within
this
area
that
we
are
in.
if
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
certainly
does
not
protect
you
against
filing
a
false
document,
this
court
has
so
held.
mr.
william
m.
ward
not
if
it’s
a
felony
to
so
file
it.
no,
i
think
this
court
held
that
--
mr.
william
m.
ward
a
false
document?
mr.
william
m.
ward
inherent
right
to
file
a
false
answer?
i
would
say
--
no.
i
would
say
no.
you’ve
got
18,
1001
staring
in
the
face
no
matter
anytime
you
file
a
document
with
the
national
government.
it’s
just
a
felony
to
file
a
false
document
with
the
national
government.
i
think
as
a
practical
matter
anytime
you
file
a
false
document
with
any
agency
of
the
federal
government,
you
got
a
felony
staring
in
the
face.
but
to
the
extent
going
back
to
your
employment
provision,
to
the
extent
that
an
employment
application
again
is
a
document
which
is
directed
at
all
people,
which
is
directed
towards
everyone,
you
don’t
--
at
the
threshold
meet
the
problem
that
you
meet
in
marchetti-grosso.
this
would
not
be
per
se
a
violation
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
to
the
extent
that
anything
was
in
there,
any
question
or
answer
was
required
which
may
incriminate
you,
then
you
get
into
this
question
of,
do
you
have
a
right
to
federal
employment
and
can
they
compel
you
to
waive
the
privilege
and
again,
you
may
have
a
problem.
i
don’t
profess
to
be
able
to
specifically
answer,
but
you
may
have
a
problem
on
the
facts.
but
i
think
this
marchetti-grosso
situation
goes
one
step
further
because
we
have
a
specific,
direct
finding
by
this
court
that
the
statutes
themselves
where
aimed
at
a
small
class
of
people
for
the
purposes
of
getting
information
to
prosecute
the
small
class
of
people.
i
think
that
is
settled
by
marchetti-grosso
and
i
think
the
lower
courts
have
so
held.
for
example,
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
nucio
case,
vacated
a
conviction
upon
a
plea
guilty
on
the
grounds
that
protecting
integrity
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
has
done
the
same
thing
last
month.
they
have
held
marchetti-grosso
retroactive.
they
have
held
that
the
harmless
error
rule
doesn’t
apply.
they
attempted
to
distinguish
the
mackey
case,
but
they
also
have
had
held
that
to
protect
the
integrity,
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
prosecutions
under
the
statute
and
land
and
the
basic
thrust
of
it
is
the
rational
of
marchetti-grosso
has
found
in
those
decisions
from
this
court.
mr.
william
m.
ward
that
is
correct.
in
order
to
pay
the
tax,
the
tax
is
paid
monthly
upon
gross
receipts.
it
is
not
an
income
tax,
it’s
an
excise
tax.
in
order
to
pay
the
tax,
you
have
to
file
a
return
monthly.
mr.
william
m.
ward
right.
now
the
reasons
for
putting
these
in
were
two-fold:
one
and
i
think
this
is
admitted
by
the
government,
it’s
always
been
admitted
by
the
government
to
show
that
he
was
a
gambler.
they
had
to
show
he
was
a
gambler.
they
had
to
show
that
he
likely
source
of
unreported
income.
mr.
william
m.
ward
precisely,
and
if
this
court
is
held
both
in
friedberg
and
holland
that
this
is
an
absolute
necessity
in
such
a
case
because
they
are
purely
totally,
solely
circumstantial
evidence
cases.
now,
the
prosecutor
then
went
onto
say,
he
needed
it
for
another
reason.
he
needed
those
figures.
he
had
to
show
that
those
figures
--
he
had
to
get
those
figures
into
evidence
and
right
after
these
returns
are
put
into
evidence,
mr.
harrington
then
testified
from
one
of
his
graphs,
exhibit
765
showing
the
total
gross
receipts
from
gambling.
now
the
reason
that
those
total
--
that
the
prosecutor
said
he
needed
those
total
gross
receipts
from
gambling
to
show
that
he
had
a
greater
income
from
gambling,
than
shown
in
his
schedule
c-returns.
in
other
words,
in
evidence
in
this
case
was
schedule
c
returns
a
showed
income
from
“policy”
and
i
think
one
returns
had
policy
wheel,
the
man
paid
his
income
tax
and
his
wagering
income.
but
the
government
argued
i
have
got
to
show
that
he
had
a
greater
income
from
gambling
than
showed
on
schedule
c.
so
i
not
only
need
those
wagering
tax
returns
to
show
that
he
was
a
gambler,
i
need
him
for
the
figures.
and
so
he
argued
to
the
jury.
he
so
argued
to
the
jury
on
four
different
occasions.
i
think
this
is
--
as
far
as
the
importance
of
these
returns
are
concerned
with
the
government,
i
think
the
prosecutor
summing
up
argument
is
almost
the
key
here.
this
was
a
long
trial
and
all
net
worth
trials
are
long
trials.
i
think
they
were
over
800
exhibits,
pieces
of
paper
put
into
the
evidence
in
this
trial.
the
reason
being
is
because
the
key
testimony
in
a
net
worth
trial
is
the
government’s
expert.
he
has
the
expert
exhibit
and
of
course
the
foundation
has
to
be
laid
to
support
everything
in
the
exhibit.
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
there
were
800
exhibits
or
an
excess
of
800
exhibits
and
that
they
key
exhibit
in
the
net
worth
case
is
the
file
net
worth
summary
by
the
prosecutor,
that
was
mentioned
to
the
jury
six
times
and
rightfully
so
you’d
expect
it.
the
next
amount
of
time
as
far
as
any
exhibit
was
mentioned
to
the
jury
was
these
wagering
tax
returns.
four
different
times,
the
prosecutor
came
back
to
these
wagering
tax
returns
and
one
of
them
in
effect
was
very
interested.
it
was
almost
a
griffin
type
case
and
these
are
said
out
in
our
reply
brief.
he
said
to
the
jury
if
these
wagering
tax
returns
are
accurate,
if
they
truly
reflect
the
ins
and
the
outs,
then
they’re
okay,
but
there
is
only
one
man
that
can
tell
us.
mr.
mackey.
come
up,
waive
your
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
explain
this.
mr.
william
m.
ward
the
government
never
took
that
position
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
william
m.
ward
i
don’t
know.
they
simply
--
implicit
in
the
jury’s
verdict
has
to
be
one
of
two
things
that
didn’t
believe
the
wagering
tax
returns
because
the
net
worth
bulge
was
larger
than
the
wagering
tax
return.
or
implicit
in
the
jury’s
verdict,
this
confusion,
confusion
that
those
wagering
tax
return
represented
taxable
income.
mr.
william
m.
ward
right.
but
see,
not
being
and
not
taking
the
stand,
mr.
mackey
didn’t
have
the
chance
of
explaining
it.
we
don’t
know
for
a
fact
that
the
jury
knew
these
were
gross
receipts.
in
other
words,
if
you
add
up
the
wagering
tax
returns
as
exhibit
765
did,
you
find
it
in
enormously
greater
figure
of
income
from
wagering
than
you
did
on
the
scheduled
c
upon
which
taxes
were
paid.
it’s
within
the
round
of
possibility
and
quite
frankly,
i
personally
believe
that
that’s
what
the
jury
found.
mr.
william
m.
ward
we
did.
but
after
43
hours,
we
have
no
idea
exactly
what
the
jury
ultimately
did
find.
mr.
william
m.
ward
in
that
particular
area?
i
don’t
know
what
else.
quite
frankly
mr.
justice,
i
don’t
know
what
else
he
put
on,
but
i
do
know
that
an
income,
one
place
he
had
in
four
years,
i
think
just
the
word
policy.
and
on
the
50-year,
he
had
the
word
policy
wheel,
plus
other
--
mr.
william
m.
ward
one
of
the
sources
of
income,
yes.
mr.
william
m.
ward
yes
sir.
mr.
william
m.
ward
to
my
knowledge
and
i
know
i’m
correct
in
this.
i
never
use
the
word
gambler.
he
never
used
the
word
gambler.
mr.
william
m.
ward
as
far
as
his
occupation
is
concerned?
it
could
have
been
insurance.
he
was
a
president
of
two
insurance
companies
and
the
mw
investment
--
i
can
argue
inferentially
that
he
never
did
because
of
the
argument
made
by
the
prosecutor
to
the
jury
and
show
he
was
a
gambler
and
the
argument
made
to
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
the
appeal
in
the
original
case.
the
government
is
admitted
here
that
the
only
evidence
of
gambling
that
the
wagering
tax
returns
and
to
some
extent
the
word
policy
or
policy
wheel
in
the
income
tax
returns.
but
again,
as
to
the
weight
given
to
that
and
the
argument
to
the
jury,
the
prosecutor
never
argued.
never
argued
that
you
could
find
that
this
man
was
a
gambler
because
of
what
he
put
in
his
scheduled
c’s.
four
times
the
prosecutor
argued
to
the
jury,
this
man
is
a
gambler
because
of
the
wagering
tax
returns
and
they
so
argued
that
in
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals.
so
it
seems
a
bit
of
a
late
date
to
come
in
here
and
try
in
a
sense
to
change
the
facts.
and
of
course,
to
me,
the
key
aspect
to
that
is
the
district
judge
in
the
2255
proceedings.
the
district
judge
in
these
2255
proceedings
tried
this
case
and
when
this
petition
was
filed
in
his
opinion,
he
said
this
represents
a
new
and
serious
question.
he
specifically
said
in
his
memorandum
opinion
that
these
returns
were
put
in
to
show
a
likely
source
of
unreported
income.
and
i
think
that
to
me
is
practically
decisive
as
far
as
how
important
these
returns
were
to
the
government
on
a
trial,
the
district
judge
in
these
proceedings
considered
them
extremely
important.
in
its
memorandum
opinion,
in
its
decision,
this
case
was
on
the
law,
not
on
the
facts,
but
on
the
law.
mr.
william
m.
ward
no
i
think
under
the
sullivan
case
mr.
justice
in
candor,
i
think
under
the
sullivan
case
having
put
something
into
schedule
c,
you
waived
the
privilege.
as
far
as
schedule
c
is
concerned,
i
think
--
mr.
william
m.
ward
yes,
plus
his
source.
mr.
william
m.
ward
yes
sir.
mr.
william
m.
ward
the
ins
and
outs
situation,
no
sir.
he
just
as
far
as
my
recollection
is
concerned,
all
he
did
was
--
mr.
william
m.
ward
the
net
figure,
the
taxable
income
figure.
mr.
william
m.
ward
no,
no
sir.
mr.
william
m.
ward
well,
the
sullivan
case
pretty
much
teaches
you
that.
the
sullivan
case
says
that
the
income
tax
return
must
be
filed
and
if
there
is
anything
specific
within
the
return
that
would
validate
--
mr.
william
m.
ward
no,
no
sir
because
i
think
there
was
a
particular
finding
here
and
this
case
mentioned
sullivan
and
distinguished
it
in
marchetti-grosso.
mr.
william
m.
ward
except
under
sullivan.
mr.
william
m.
ward
they
can
demand
the
source
of
--
or
they
can
demand
the
income
figures,
yes.
sullivan
specifically
holds
and
i
think
sullivan
is
still
the
law
that
if
any
source
of
income
information
would
in
any
way
incriminate
you,
then
you
can
claim
the
privilege.
mr.
william
m.
ward
in
the
income
tax
returns,
no
sir,
no
sir.
but
there
is
no
as
i
say
the
income
tax
returns,
there
is
no
statement
that
he
was
a
gambler,
there
was
this
policy
and
policy
wheel.
but
again
as
i
pointed
out
in
the
reply,
if
this
were
enough
to
go
to
the
jury
and
i
personally
don’t
think
it
would
have
been
fair
comments
to
go
to
the
jury
with
these
schedule
c’s
and
say
that
this
shows
the
man
is
a
gambler
and
has
a
likely
source
of
unreported
income,
there
are
two
big
insurance
companies
involved
there.
mr.
william
m.
ward
but
he
didn’t.
he
could’ve
but
he
didn’t.
four
times
he
went
back
to
the
jury
and
he
said
here
is
your
likely
source
of
unreported
income.
mr.
downing
wants
a
likely
source
of
unreported
income
here
it
is,
and
another
occasion
he
said
one
of
the
witnesses
testified
that
mr.
mackey
never
had
that
kind
of
money,
never
had
that
kind
of
money.
do
you
want
to
see
where
he
had
that
kind
of
money?
take
a
look
at
the
schedules,
the
wagering
tax.
four
times
he
went
back
to
those,
four
times.
i
think
they
were
extremely
important
to
the
prosecutor
and
being
extremely
important
to
the
prosecutor,
they
were
important
--
he
fought
something
like
two
weeks
to
get
these
into
evidence
and
even
the
judge
at
an
evidentiary
objection,
at
an
evidentiary
objection
said
they
were
somewhat
inflammatory,
didn’t
want
to
leave
them
in,
and
then
decided
to
leave
them
in,
not
so
much
into
the
issue
of
gambling
but
they
contained
figures
that
the
government
said
was
absolutely
necessary
to
their
case.
the
gross
income
figure
is
just
the
gambling.
now,
if
they
weren't
important,
then
the
o’connell
case
would
have
taken
over.
there
was
a
specific
ruling
in
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
that
returns
that
characterized
the
man
a
gambler
if
not
relevant
to
the
case
with
prejudicial
and
reversible
error.
so
i
just
don’t
think
the
government
can
have
it
two
ways
to
have
one
point
convince
the
judge
at
the
trial
level
that
these
are
relevant
and
extremely
important
and
must
go
in
and
then
on
the
appellant
level
hearsay,
they
weren’t
very
important,
they
weren’t
very
relevant
and
we
didn’t
really
need
them
because
if
that
were
the
case,
this
case
should
have
been
reversed
the
first
time
around
on
the
issue
of
ricardo.
then
we
get
into
the
nature
of
the
privilege
itself,
the
transactional
testimonial.
the
government
is
argued
that
because
marchetti-grosso
specifically
talked
about
gamblers,
but
this
is
not
a
gambling
prosecution
and
therefore,
the
thrust
of
the
decision
should
not
go
to
this
type
of
a
situation.
i
think
the
privilege
itself,
no
person
in
a
criminal
prosecution
should
be
a
witness
against
themselves
answers
the
question.
i
think
once
the
privilege
is
violated
and
this
court
has
specifically
ruled
that
the
privilege
was
violated
in
the
marchetti-grosso
situation.
once
the
privilege
is
violated,
that
taints
the
evidence.
i
can’t
conceive
of
it
being
in
use
of
another
prosecution.
i
can’t
conceive
of
this
court
holding
or
stating
that
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
can
be
violated
and
there
are
some
circumstances
in
which
the
evidence
could
be
used
in
a
criminal
prosecution
against
the
witness.
to
me
in
any
event
is
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
if
you
go
back
to
the
silverthorne
lumber
case,
this
court
held
that
the
essence
of
a
provision
which
prohibits
the
acquisition
of
evidence
is
not
only
that
the
evidence
not
be
used
in
court,
but
that
it
not
be
used
at
all.
you
get
into
the
murphy
v
the
waterfront
commission
state,
a
silver
platter
sort
of
a
thing
where
the
court
held
that
if
evidence
be
taken
on
the
state
level
in
violation
of
a
witnesses's
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
it
may
not
be
used
in
any
manner,
in
any
manner,
these
are
the
words
of
this
court
in
a
criminal
prosecution
by
the
federal
government
against
the
witness.
the
gardner
case
reaffirmed,
just
i
think
a
year
or
two
ago,
reaffirmed
the
murphy
v
waterfront
commission
in
that
situation
and
i
would
like
to
spend
a
second
with
the
gardner
case
because
i
think
it
has
some
relevance
to
this
case.
the
gardner
case
was
a
police
officer
who
lost
his
job
because
he
refused
to
surrender
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
he
wouldn’t
sign
a
waiver
of
immunity.
a
year
and
a
half
later,
this
court
decided
the
garrity
v.
new
jersey
case
said
they
couldn’t
do
that
to
him,
couldn’t
make
the
imposition
of
the
penalty
costly.
he
then
filed
a
petition
for
reinstatement
for
his
job
which
was
denied
and
the
case
worked
itself
up
and
that
this
court
ultimately
decided
that
he
should
get
his
job
back
but
his
privilege
was
a
violated.
in
other
words,
in
a
civil
manner,
this
court
had
no
problem
with
making
garrity
retroactive
to
a
set
of
facts
that
happened
a
year
and
a
half
before
where
a
man
had
lost
his
property,
his
job
if
you
will
because
of
a
violations
privilege.
it
just
seems
to
me
in
a
criminal
manner,
in
a
criminal
case
where
a
man
has
been
convicted
in
a
very
important
link
of
the
chain
of
evidence
needed
to
convict
is
a
part
of
the
conviction
process
that
he
has
a
right
to
a
new
trial
on
the
same
basis
that
garrity
or
gardner
had
the
right
to
his
job.
so
as
far
as
this
court
i
think
persistently
and
continuously
held
that
once
the
privilege
has
been
violated
that
the
evidence
cannot
be
used
in
any
manner
against
the
witnessed,
it
is
always
held,
at
least
i
read
the
case
as
far
as
state
prosecutions
are
concerned,
and
it
is
always
been
extremely
careful
and
talking
in
particularly
in
retroactivity
cases.
in
talking
for
example,
that
the
miranda
rule
should
be
prospectively
applied,
the
escobedo
rule
should
be
prospectively
apply.
it
always
been
extremely
careful
to
iterate
and
reiterate
and
continue
to
carve
out
this
exception
that
where
it
a
shown
that
a
statement
is
taken
from
a
witness
involuntarily
and
used
against
him,
then
he
still
has
the
right
at
anytime
to
avail
himself
at
any
state
or
federal
machinery
for
bringing
this
to
the
attention
of
the
court
and
getting
the
appropriate
relief
which
is
exactly
what
we
have
done
here.
i
believe,
i
still
have
four
minutes
mr.
chief
justice.
i
like
to
save
them
if
i
may.
mr.
william
m.
ward
mr.
chief
justice,
on
many
occasions,
the
assistant
solicitor
general
said
that
is
not
the
case
and
that
is
quite
true.
the
case
he
argued
on
the
facts
here
is
not
the
case
that
existed
in
the
criminal
trial.
he
is
arguing
basically
is
we
should
have
won.
he
is
arguing
that
the
court
was
wrong,
that
this
evidence
should
not
come
in,
there
are
objections
to
the
evidence
at
the
time
we
made
it
were
proper
and
correct,
and
of
course
i
agree
with
him.
the
problem
is
we
lost
the
argument
and
the
evidence
was
admitted
against
us,
and
it
was
used
against
us.
and
i
think
to
the
effect
that
it
was
used
against
us,
i
refer
the
court
to
page
16
and
17
of
our
reply
with
a
prosecutor
having
gotten
that
evidence
in,
relied
on
it,
immensely
before
the
jury.
it
was
the
second
most
important
part
of
his
argument
to
the
jury.
this
is
what
we
are
talking
about.
how
did
this
affect
the
jury
out
43
hours
for
five
days?
that
is
exactly
what
we
are
talking
about.
mr.
william
m.
ward
i
think
so,
yes
sir.
i
think
that
is
a
long
time
for
a
jury
to
be
out,
yes
sir.
i
think
it
is
a
very
long
time
for
the
jury
to
(voice
overlap).
mr.
william
m.
ward
well,
i
question
how
much
they
really
-
they
might
have
read
it
a
quite
number
and
quite
a
lot
of
it
was
foundation
evidence,
evidence
that
didn’t
necessarily
had
to
be
read
but
had
to
be
in
for
the
purposes
of
providing
the
foundation
for
the
exhibit
evidence.
so
i
think
that
is
a
long
time
to
be
out,
yes
sir.
as
far
as
the
million
dollar
net
worth
case,
i
am
not
too
sure
it’s
before
this
court
but
i
would
like
to
refer
in
the
large
appendix
that
was
filed,
government’s
exhibit
800
property
held
in
the
name
of
gibraltar
industrial
life
insurance
company.
in
other
words,
i
don't
take
too
much
time
on
this,
approximately
$1
million
in
assets,
held
in
the
names
of
regulated
insurance
companies,
under
the
control
of
the
director
of
insurance
in
the
state
of
indiana
makes
up
that
bulge.
that
is
one
of
the
big
arguments
in
the
case,
but
that
was
an
argument
in
the
case
of
the
original
level
and
would
be
on
retrial.
it
certainly
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
which
is
before
this
court
right
now.
on
the
harmless
error
doctrine,
i
do
want
to
make
this
point.
i
want
to
make
it
strongly.
the
constitution
says,
the
fifth
amendment
says,
no
person
shall
be
a
witness
against
himself
on
a
criminal
prosecution.
it
does
not
say
that
no
person
shall
be
a
witness
against
himself
in
a
criminal
prosecution
except
he
can
be
compelled
to
have
testimony
admitted
against
him,
if
later
is
found
to
be
harmless
error.
the
harmless
error
in
the
constitutional
rulings,
the
harrington
and
the
chapman
situations
usually
at
least
as
i
read
them
come
up
on
fourth
amendment
situations
or
confrontation
situations.
the
constitution
does
not
prohibit
searches
and
seizures.
it
prohibits
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
and
the
constitution
requires
confrontation
but
it
doesn’t
necessarily,
specifically
prohibit
evidence
which
would
go
in,
in
a
trial
without
confrontation.
these
rules
have
exclusion
or
judge
made
rules
and
i
think
there
can
be
a
further
emendation
on
these
of
harmless
error,
but
the
constitution
specifically
says,
no
person
shall
be
a
witness
against
himself
in
a
criminal
proceeding
and
mr.
mackey
was
a
witness
against
himself
in
a
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
william
m.
ward
well,
that
was
the
claim
i
believe
of
the
mr.
mackey’s
defense
lawyer
at
trial
that
all
of
the
evidence
--
mr.
william
m.
ward
are
we
talking
about
the
wagering
tax
return
mr.
justice
or
the
--
mr.
william
m.
ward
income
tax
return.
mr.
william
m.
ward
correct.
mr.
william
m.
ward
that
is
what
the
defense
lawyer
argued.
that
is
--
mr.
william
m.
ward
i
think
you
should
have
wanted
at
the
time,
yes,
but
having
lost
it
having
lost
the
argument.
mr.
william
m.
ward
in
the
wagering
tax
return?
mr.
william
m.
ward
in
the
income
--
no,
there
was
no
coercion
there.
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
m.
ward
he
could
have,
yes.
but
he
didn’t.
that’s
why
i
say
the
case
as
it
existed
below
--
mr.
william
m.
ward
no,
i
think
not
because
i
think
that
you
cannot
have
a
person
testify
against
himself.
the
only
thing
i
can
rely
on
mr.
justice
is
the
prosecutor’s
actions
in
the
court
below.
he
denied
that
argument.
he
told
the
judge
that
that
was
not
a
valid
argument.
he
told
the
judge
he
absolutely
needed
these
figures
from
these
returns
and
the
judge
agreed
with
him.
the
judge
agreed
with
them,
said
these
returns
must
go
in
and
then
he
argued
to
the
jury
from
these
returns.
i
can
only
argue
the
cases
that
happened
below.
these
were
used
and
they
were
used
very
violently
against
the
petitioner.
mr.
william
m.
ward
that
is
correct
your
honor.
i
think
the
solicitor
general,
as
far
as
i
understand
is
the
man
on
this
point
now.
they
haven’t
raised
the
question
of
waive.
they
waived
it
and
raised
it
in
the
seventh
circuit
but
they
necessarily
have
not
raised
that
here.
of
course,
our
position
is
we
had
no
privilege.
kahriger
and
lewis
had
taken
that
privilege
away.
it
wasn’t
a
question
of
something
we
didn’t
know,
it
isn't
a
question
of
something
that
the
--
on
the
state
--
we
had
no
privilege.
we
had
no
privilege.
mr.
william
m.
ward
yes,
yes.
i
again,
i
just
go
back
to
the
fact
that
i
think
marchetti-grosso
righted
a
wrong.
kahriger
and
lewis
were
bad
long.
marchetti-grosso
so
held.
mr.
william
m.
ward
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
the
parts
that
i
thought
were
important
are
in
the
reply
put
on
the
(inaudible)
in
the
reply.
the
full
summations
will
be
found
in
volume
four
of
the
appellant’s
appendix
in
the
original
trial
which
was
filed
in
this
court
when
i
filed
the
petition
for
certiorari.
