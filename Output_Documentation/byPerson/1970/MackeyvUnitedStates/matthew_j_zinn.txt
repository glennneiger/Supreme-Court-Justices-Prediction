mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court
i
should
like
first
to
set
out
some
additional
facts
relating
to
petitioner’s
conviction
which
we
believe
are
essential
to
this
court’s
resolution
of
the
case.
as
has
been
noted,
the
government
proceeded
on
the
networth
method
of
proof.
under
the
government’s
proof,
petitioner’s
networth
increased
during
the
prosecution
years
by
more
than
million
dollars,
while
he
and
his
wife
reported
taxable
income
during
those
years
totaling
a
$143,000.00.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
five
years,
1956
through
60
inclusive.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
he
started
out
with
assets
of
roughly
$360,000.00
and
according
to
the
government's
computation
had
over
a
million
and
a
half
dollars
of
assets
at
the
end
of
the
prosecution
years.
but
in
terms
of
taxable
income
that
he
reported
a
$143,000.00.
the
principal
issue
at
the
trial
did
not
have
to
do
with
gambling,
the
issue
was
whether
the
government
was
justified
in
including
in
petitioner’s
networth,
certain
assets
which
petitioner’s
acquired
in
the
names
of
corporations
which
he
controlled,
in
the
names
of
friends,
relatives
and
even
a
fictitious
persons.
it
was
a
long
trial.
more
than
80
witnesses
testified
and
the
bulk
of
the
testimony
showed
that
petitioner
had
furnished
the
funds
for
the
purchase
of
assets
consisting
of
securities,
real
estate,
loans
and
mortgages
paying
for
these
assets
either
in
currency
or
with
cashier’s
checks.
the
largest
transaction
and
which
is
typical
except
for
the
dollars
involved
related
to
petitioners
acquisition
of
stock
in
a
fire
insurance
company.
he
first
paid
$50,000.00
in
currency
with
instructions
that
the
stock
be
issued
in
the
name
of
one
of
the
corporations
which
he
control.
later,
he
paid
an
additional
$98,000.00
in
currency
for
the
purchase
of
additional
shares
in
the
name
of
the
second
company
that
he
controlled,
and
still
later,
he
paid
$15,000.00
in
currency
for
additional
shares.
well,
this
was
the
largest
investment
he
made
during
the
prosecution
years.
the
government’s
proof
showed
that
on
literally
dozens
of
occasions,
he
purchased
assets
using
cash
or
cashier’s
checks.
the
largest
of
the
companies
which
petitioner
controlled
was
the
gibraltar
industrial
life
insurance
company
of
which
he
was
chairman
of
the
board.
petitioner’s
basic
contention
at
the
trial
in
this
case
was
that
the
assets
he
purchased
and
in
most
instances
had
registered
in
the
name
of
gibraltar
actually
with
the
property
of
gibraltar
and
therefore
could
not
be
included
in
his
net
worth,
but
the
income
tax
returns
that
gibraltar
filed
showed
that
the
corporation
operated
at
a
loss
during
the
prosecution
years
and
did
not
have
sufficient
capital
to
acquire
the
assets
which
petitioner
paid
for
during
those
years.
petitioner’s
sister
was
gibraltar’s
treasurer.
she
testified
on
direct
examination
by
the
government
at
gibraltar’s
books
and
records
reflected
all
receipts
of
that
company.
on
cross
examination
by
defense
counsel,
she
changed
her
testimony
and
explained
that
not
all
receipts
had
been
recorded.
additional
cash
was
available
to
gibraltar
she
said
because
insurance
premiums
paid
in
cash
by
policy
holders
were
not
taxable
and
therefore
where
not
recorded,
while
this
might
explain
why
the
receipts
were
not
included
on
gibraltar’s
income
tax
returns.
it
could
not
explain
the
absence
of
a
showing
of
these
receipts
on
the
books
and
records
of
gibraltar
and
on
the
reports
which
gibraltar
was
required
to
file
annually
with
the
department
of
insurance
of
the
state
of
indiana.
and
in
this
connection,
i’d
like
stress
one
point
that
while
the
investment
which
petitioner
said
belonged
to
gibraltar
but
which
were
unrecorded
on
its
books
and
records
were
paid
for
either
in
currency
or
cashier’s
checks,
that
corporation’s
expenses
were
with
rare
exception
paid
for
by
regular
bank
check.
this
then
in
brief
compass
was
the
government’s
proof
that
petitioner's
net
worth
has
increased
during
the
prosecution
years
by
substantially
more
than
can
be
accounted
for
by
the
taxable
income
reported
on
his
returns.
in
addition,
it
was
the
government’s
obligation
under
the
net
worth
method
to
show
a
likely
source
of
additional
taxable
income
that
could
account
for
the
net
worth
increase.
to
this
end
the
government
introduced
into
evidence,
petitioner's
income
tax
returns
for
1956
to
1960,
which
show
that
certain
of
his
income
came
from
being
a
“policy
operator”
and
in
one
instance
from
a
“policy
wheel”.
i’d
like
to
correct
one
factual
statement
that
mr.
ward
made
and
that
was
that
defense
counsel
did
not
object
to
the
introduction
into
evidence
of
the
schedule
c
forms.
he
did
object
on
the
grounds
of
prejudice
and
the
objection
was
overruled
and
the
income
tax
returns
were
admitted.
a
second
point
omitted
from
mr.
ward’s
statement
was
that
in
addition
to
the
schedule
c
forms
which
indicated
that
petitioner
was
in
the
policy
business,
there
was
the
testimony
of
an
internal
revenue
service
agent
that
in
the
course
of
his
investigation,
petitioner
admitted
that
he
was
in
the
gambling
business.
the
government
also
sought
to
introduce
petitioners
wagering
tax
forms
for
the
60-month
period
covered
by
the
indictment.
defense
counsel
objected
and
again
this
is
most
important,
the
objection
according
to
mr.
ward
was
based
on
the
ground
that
the
wagering
tax
forms
were
prejudicial,
but
it
was
also
based
on
the
ground
that
the
information
disclosed
in
the
forms
could
be
computed
by
reference
to
the
income
tax
returns.
that
is
that
they
showed
nothing
more
than
the
income
tax
returns
themselves.
the
government
attempted
to
introduce
the
wagering
tax
forms;
first,
during
the
course
of
the
testimony
of
the
first
witness
who
had
prepared
petitioner’s
income
tax
returns.
these
forms
were
not
mentioned
again
until
more
than
60
witnesses
had
testified
regarding
petitioner's
cash
transactions,
and
this
was
during
the
course
of
testimony
of
petitioner’s
secretary.
on
both
occasions,
the
court
reserved
ruling
on
the
ground
that
the
government
had
not
shown
that
the
forms
were
not
merely
cumulative
of
the
information
that
appeared
in
the
income
tax
returns,
not
until
the
government’s
last
witness
testified
was
there
further
mentioned
of
the
wagering
tax
forms.
defense
counsel
again
objected
to
admission
of
the
forms
on
the
ground
both
that
they
were
prejudicial
and
cumulative
of
what
was
in
the
income
tax
returns.
now,
the
forms
which
are
reproduced
in
the
appendix
which
is
on
file
with
this
court,
show
have
an
entry
and
i
am
reading
form
page
41
of
the
appendix,
the
gross
amount
of
wagers
accepted
during
the
month
--
page
41
mr.
justice.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
right.
they
were
involved
here
though,
and
so
far
as
i
know,
well,
we
do
not
have
all
the
forms
reproduced
here.
i
am
not
aware
of
any
layoff
so
that
that
was
an
issue
in
the
case.
so,
those
figures
if
you
add
up,
if
you
take
12
months
wagering
tax
forms
and
add
up
the
gross
receipts
figures
on
those
12
forms
presumably,
that
should
be
the
figure
that
should
go
into
gross
receipts
on
schedule
c
of
the
income
tax
returns,
gross
receipts
and
that’s
the
line
reads,
gross
receipts
on
schedule
c.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
income
from
a
business
or
profession,
it
is
filed
by
an
individual
proprietor.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
someone
who
is
employed
wouldn’t
have
to
bother
with
that
form.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
believe
you
did
mr.
chief
justice
and
i
hope
to
–-
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes
sir.
this
is
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
the
court
said
in
marchetti
and
grosso
that
this
was
a
revenue
measure,
but
that
because
of
the
inter
relationship
of
the
wagering
tax
information
that
had
to
be
furnished
and
the
comprehensive
scheme
of
federal
and
states
statutes
prohibiting
gambling
and
gambling
related
activities
that
the
privilege
would
be
a
complete
defense
if
the
forms
were
not
filed.
i
would
like
though
to
make
the
point
because
i
don’t
think
it's
clear
as
to
what
the
income
tax
returns
showed
because
i
think
that
this
is
critical
to
this
case.
if
i
were
preparing
an
income
tax
return
and
i
have
a
wagering
tax
forms
in
front
of
me,
i
would
take
the
12
forms
and
i
would
add
up
the
figures
from
each
one
and
put
it
down
in
the
gross
receipts
line
on
the
income
tax
return.
that
is
not
what
was
done
here.
the
figure
that
appears
on
the
income
tax
returns
is
substantially
smaller,
the
gross
receipts
figure
that
is
substantially
smaller
than
the
sum
of
any
12
months
wagering
tax
forms.
but
the
reason
for
defense
counsel’s
objection
was
not
only
the
prejudice,
it
was
that
it
was
cumulative
and
the
reason
for
this
is
that
on
the
income
tax
return
in
addition
to
the
gross
receipts
figure,
there
is
a
space
for
deductions
and
one
of
the
deductions
that
petitioner
claimed
was
a
deduction
for
the
excise
taxes
paid.
in
other
words,
the
sum
of
the
excise
taxes
paid
for
the
12-month
period
appeared
as
a
deduction
on
the
income
tax
return.
and
basically,
the
argument
that
was
made
by
petitioner’s
counsel
at
the
trial
was,
well
the
jury
can
compute
this
itself.
all
it
has
to
do
is
to
take
the
excise
tax
deduction
again
which
on
this
form
if
you
add
up
12
forms,
add
up
the
deductions
that
show
on
12
forms
which
is
10%
of
the
gross.
that
figure
appeared
on
the
income
tax
return
as
a
deduction.
so
defense
counsel’s
arguments
as
to
that
it
didn’t
shown
anything
more
was,
let
the
jury
and
multiply
the
excise
tax
deduction
by
10
and
then
they
themselves
can
see
what
the
gross
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes
it
is
mr.
justice.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
it
is
and
it
was
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
it
is
the
cost
of
doing
business.
it
is
a
cost
of
doing
business.
and
it
is
deductible
and
it
was
claimed.
and
so,
it
wasn’t
only
the
prejudice
ground
that
the
defense
counsel
objected
on.
he
said
it
was
cumulative,
let
the
jury
multiply
by
10
and
then
they
will
know
that
the
gross
receipts
figure
which
was
only
a
fraction
of
the
total
gross
receipts
shown
on
the
wagering
tax
forms
was
substantially
larger.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
think
very
frankly
mr.
chief
justice.
i
am
speaking
as
a
matter
of
hind
side.
i
think
that
the
summary
form
to
which
mr.
ward
referred
earlier,
this
form
765
which
is
a
summary
exhibit
of
all
the
wagering
tax
forms
could
have
been
computed
by
reference
to
the
income
tax
returns
alone.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
from
the
wagering
tax
forms,
the
schedule
c
and
we
have
asked
the
government
prosecutor
why
did
you
pushed
to
put
this
in.
he
said
why
should
not
i
push,
louis
and
cargo
was
on
the
books
and
this
was
good
evidence,
and
it
highlighted
the
opportunities
that
a
gambler
has
to
since
he
is
always
dealing
in
cash
to
hide
income,
but
we
had
here
evidence
that
he
was
a
gambler
from
the
income
tax
returns.
the
evidence
of
the
revenue
agent
and
also
the
fact
that
this
could
have
been
computed
admittedly
not
as
vividly
for
the
jury
by
reference
to
the
income
tax
returns.
that
is
one
of
the
grounds
on
which
defense
counsel
objected
to
admission
of
the
evidence
on
trial.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
multiplying
the
excise
tax
deduction
by
10
and
subtracting
from
the
product
of
that
multiplication,
the
figure
that
was
shown
as
gross
receipts
on
the
income
tax
returns.
now,
that
wouldn’t
have
accounted
for
all
the
income
that
was
missing.
a
question
was
asked
if
mr.
ward
is
the
government’s
position
that
the
wagering
tax
forms
are
right
or
wrong.
or
we
really
do
not
know
whether
they
were
right
or
wrong.
they
didn’t
account
for
$4,000.00
a
week
of
cash
which
is
about
what
it
works
out
was
missing
from
petitioner’s
income
tax
returns,
roughly
$200,000.00
a
year.
we
do
not
know
if
the
net
figure
was
right
or
not,
but
we
didn’t
have
to
prove
whether
it
was
right.
all
we
have
to
show
was
a
likely
source
of
income.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that
is
right,
but
they
all
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
right.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
but
the
fact
is
mr.
justice
stewart
that
defense
counsel
had
a
point
in
saying
this
could
have
been
computed
by
multiplying
the
excise
tax
deduction
which
was
also
on
the
income
tax
returns
by
10.
and
you
would
have
again
had
this
inflated
gross
receipts
figure.
the
two
just
weren't
consistent
and
there
were
other
deductions
claimed
on
the
income
tax
returns.
i
have
examined
those.
mr.
justice
white,
i
believe
you
asked
the
question
regarding
that.
he
claims
deductions
for
cost
of
supplies
and
other
deductions,
but
he
only
showed
the
net
figure
in
the
gross
receipts
column
on
the
schedule
c.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
think
we’d
still
be
given
mr.
justice
harlan.
our
position
is
that
at
the
time
that
these
wagering
tax
forms
were
filed,
there
was
no
certainty
that
they
would
prove
a
significant
link
in
the
chain
of
evidence
tending
to
convict
petitioner
of
income
tax
evasion.
and
we
say
this
--mr.
ward
has
referred
to
waterfront
--
the
murphy
and
waterfront
commission
case
and
the
very
broad
language
that
was
used
in
that
case
regarding
any
use
of
testimony
compelled
in
violation
of
the
privilege.
and
i
would
like
to
put
a
hypothetical
to
the
court
regarding
murphy
and
waterfront
commission
which
shows
we
think
despite
the
broad
language
that
there
are
some
limits,
let
us
suppose
that
a
commission
is
convened
to
examine
bribery
by
public
officials.
and
i
am
called
to
testify
before
this
commission
today,
october
21,
and
i
testify
that
after
invoking
my
privilege
and
having
my
claim
rejected
and
so
forth
that
on
march
15th
of
this
year,
i
accepted
a
$5,000.00
bribe
for
engaging
in
some
nefarious
activity
in
connection
with
my
employment.
now,
next,
april
15
comes
and
i
have
to
file
my
income
tax
return.
if
i
don’t
include
that
$5,000.00
as
an
income,
i
would
suggest,
that
murphy
and
the
waterfront
commission
doesn’t
necessarily
resolved
the
question
whether
the
privilege
in
that
case
would
bar
the
introduction
of
my
prior
testimony
because
the
theme
running
through
this
court’s
decision
in
the
self-incrimination
area
has
been
that
unless
it
will
surely
proved
a
significant
link
in
the
chain
of
evidence
tending
to
convict,
the
privilege
shall
not
apply.
and
so
we
say
that
even
in
the
case
you
posited
mr.
justice,
we
think
we’d
be
here.
i
would
like
at
this
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that
is
correct.
we
couldn’t
have
gotten
these
in
under
ricardo
if
the
gross
receipts
figure
and
the
tax
deduction
figures
tide
in
with
the
income
tax
returns
because
then
i
think
the
argument
as
to
prejudice
and
again,
this
would
be
in
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judge.
he
has
to
weigh
the
possible
effect
on
the
jury
of
the
disclosure
of
gambling
against
the
additional
contribution
that
the
evidence
might
make.
so
i
think
we
would
have
had
a
very
difficult
time
getting
in
the
way
using
tax
forms,
had
they
been
consistent
with
the
later
filed
income
tax
returns.
it
was
only
the
later
act
of
showing
a
smaller
gross
receipts
figure
on
the
income
tax
returns
that
made
the
wagering
tax
forms
at
all
relevant
in
this
trial.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
if
he
hadn’t
filed
the
wagering
tax
forms
at
all?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
the
point
of
the
question.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
right.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
right,
i
assume
he
would
not
have
claimed
the
deduction.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
do
not
think
that
is
right
mr.
justice.
it
seems
to
me
that
nothing
was
triggered
by
the
wagering
tax
forms.
the
last
one
was
filed
for
any
given
year.
let
us
say
1956
on
january
31,
1957
on
or
before
that
date
and
his
income
tax
return
was
not
filed
until
later
and
i
don’t
think
at
that
point
that
they
triggered
anything.
looking
at
it
on
january
31st
of
any
given
year
with
respect
to
the
prior
year,
i
don’t
think
they
triggered
anything.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that
he
did
not
claim
the
deduction?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
think
in
that
case
--
i
think
first
of
all,
let
me
just
say
i
think
that
is
an
extremely
unlikely
hypothetical
that
you
wouldn’t
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
for
the
gross
receipts,
if
he
did
not
claim
the
deduction,
yes.
but
that’s
not
this
case.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
we
don’t
think
that
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
would
say
on
that
issue
mr.
justice
marshall
that
what
the
court
was
concerned
about
in
marchetti
and
grosso
was
the
comprehensive
scheme
of
federal
and
state
gambling
statutes,
anti-gambling
statutes,
and
the
fact
that
possible
disclosures
merely
this
form
showing
gross
receipts
and
a
deduction
would
be
enough
to
incriminate
somebody
for
violations
of
some
of
these
statutes,
but
that’s
not
this
case.
these
forms
could
not
incriminate
anybody
of
income
tax
evasion
unless
they
were
not
consistent
with
the
later
filed
income
tax
returns,
and
i
think
the
proper
way
to
look
at
it,
is
to
say
what
was
the
situation
on
january
31
of
any
year?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
of
course
not,
of
course
not.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
in
terms
of
income
tax
deduction?
he
did.
i
supposed
he
would
argue
that
he
subjected
himself
to
self-incrimination
for
federal
and
state
anti-gambling
statute,
but
this
is
not
this
case
mr.
chief
justice.
in
the
few
minutes
i
have
remaining
i
would
like
to
turn
briefly
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
in
marchetti
and
grosso?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
no
mr.
justice,
we’re
not.
we’re
saying
that
it
simply
doesn’t
extend
to
this
case
that
the
premises
on
which
marchetti-grosso
was
decided
was
this
conflict
between
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
comprehensive
scheme
of
federal
and
state
anti-gambling
statutes
on
the
other
hand.
and
we’re
not
involved
with
this
comprehensive
scheme
in
this
case.
we’re
involved
with
income
tax
evasion.
and
we
say
that
marchetti-grosso's
rationale
does
not
extend
to
this
case
because
at
the
time,
the
wagering
tax
forms
were
filed,
it
could
not
be
said
as
it
could
be
said
in
marchetti
and
grosso,
that
they
would
surely
prove
a
significant
link
in
the
chain
of
evidence
tending
to
convict
petitioner
of
income
tax
evasion.
it
was
only
the
later
act
of
filing
an
inconsistent
income
tax
return
that
made
these
forms
at
all
relevant
in
this
prosecution.
and
we
say
despite
the
broad
language
in
murphy
and
the
waterfront
commission
regarding
any
use
of
compelled
testimony,
that
question
is
an
open
one
and
warrants
serious
consideration
by
this
court.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that
is
one
of
our
arguments
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
that
is
correct.
now,
i
would
like
to
spend
my
last
five
minutes
on
the
retroactive
aspect
and
i
would
like
to
turn
first,
if
i
may
to
the
test
that
was
proposed
by
mr.
justice
harlan
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
the
desist
case
and
we
submit
that
under
that
test,
there
would
be
no
basis
for
retroactivity
in
this
case.
we
say
first
but
since
this
is
a
collateral
proceeding
under
section
2255,
the
first
inquiry
that
must
be
made
is
whether
this
rule
of
marchetti-grosso
is
one
that
improves
the
fact
finding
process
and
it
seems
clear
to
us
under
mr.
justice
harlan’s
test
that
it
does
quite
the
contrary.
it
worsens
the
fact
finding
process
because
it
excludes
evidence
that
is
plainly
trustworthy
and
plainly
reliable.
second,
mr.
justice
harlan
would
ask
is
this
a
new
rule
or
an
old
rule?
and
we
think
contrary
to
what
mr.
ward
has
said
earlier
that
it
is
clearly
a
new
rule.
there
was
a
time
when
lewis
and
kahriger
were
on
the
books,
when
this
case
would
not
be
here
because
it
would
be
clear
that
the
wagering
tax
forms
were
admissible.
finally,
mr.
justice
harlan
would
say
we
have
to
look
at
the
law
that
existed
at
the
time
the
conviction
became
final
in
this
case.
and
the
conviction
became
final
in
this
case
on
october
11,
1965,
when
this
court
denied
petitioner's
petition
for
certiorari
on
direct
appeal.
no
petition
for
rehearing
was
filed
from
that
denial
and
albertson
was
not
decided
until
november
15th,
1965.
so
that
even
if
one
could
argue
that
the
viability
of
lewis
and
kahriger
was
placed
in
question
by
albertson.
petitioner
would
not
be
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
marchetti-grosso
under
mr.
justice
harlan’s
analysis.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes
sir,
i
am.
and
under
your
analysis
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
no
sir,
but
i
apply
the
test
that
you
say
you
would
apply,
if
you
had
more
than
one
vote
and
under
that
test,
it
seems
clear
to
us
that
marchetti-grosso
would
not
be
retroactive.
that’s
only
preliminary.
i
might
add
that
we
think
the
result
is
the
same
under
the
three
factor
test
which
this
court
has
followed
beginning
with
the
link
letter
case.
the
purpose
of
marchetti-grosso
is
to
protect
the
constitutional
privilege
against
the
statutory
system
jeopardizing
it.
that
statutory
system
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
petitioner
has
not
been
prosecuted
for
any
violation
of
a
federal
or
state
anti-gambling
statute.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
the
constitutional
privilege
against
the
statutory
system
that
jeopardizes
it
and
that
statutory
system
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
in
this
case,
the
comprehensive
federal
and
state
anti-gambling
provisions
are
just
not
involved.
and
furthermore
to
the
extent
that
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
rests
on
notions
of
an
individual’s
right
of
privacy.
the
invasion
of
that
privacy
cannot
now
be
restored
by
according
marchetti-grosso
retroactive
effect.
finally,
and
most
important
in
terms
of
the
purpose
criteria
in
which
this
court
has
stressed,
the
marchetti-grosso
rule
does
not
go
to
the
integrity
of
the
fact
finding
process.
we
think
the
evidence
here
is
far
more
reliable
than
the
evidence
involved
in
johnson
against
new
jersey
which
held
that
miranda
was
not
retroactive.
the
plain
fact
is
that
nobody
files
wagering
tax
forms
who
does
not
have
to
file
them
and
nobody
puts
a
figure
down
on
a
wagering
tax
form
for
gross
receipts
that's
higher
than
it
has
to
be.
we
think
it
is
clear
that
the
--
at
the
very
minimum
petitioner
had
gross
receipts
from
wagering
as
shown
on
his
wagering
tax
forms.
we
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
trustworthiness
and
reliability
of
the
evidence
here
is
almost
as
great
as
it
was
in
linkletter
and
desist.
petitioner
attempts
to
avoid
the
rule
of
the
johnson
case
which
we
think
is
controlling
and
that
of
tehan
and
shott
on
the
ground
that
he
comes
within
the
holding
of
johnson
and
deno.
in
short
that
this
is
a
coerce
confession
case.
we
think
this
argument
was
adequately
answered
by
the
court
below.
i’d
like
to
quote
briefly
from
the
first
full
paragraph
on
page
53
of
the
appendix.
defendant
contends
however
that
the
wagering
tax
returns
constitute
coerce
confessions
since
they
were
filed
under
the
compulsion
of
a
legal
command
and
that
retroactivity
follows
automatically
once
the
question
is
so
characterized,
but
the
compulsion
which
turns
interrogation
into
a
violation
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
is
not
the
same
as
the
coercion
and
intimidation
which
makes
a
confession
involuntary
and
a
denial
of
due
process.
and
at
this
point,
the
court
cited
davis
v.
north
carolina
which
was
decided
on
the
same
day
as
johnson
and
showed
precisely
what
the
court
was
pointing
out
but
not
every
self-incrimination
case
is
a
coerce
confession
case
and
this
is
not
a
coerce
confession
case
under
any
standards
that
this
court
has
applied.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
am
not
sure
(voice
overlap)
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
would
like
to
say
that
completely
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
don’t
quite
think
i
can,
except
to
the
extent
that
i
can
show
that
the
gross
receipts
figure
could
have
been
computed.
the
gross
receipts
figure
from
wagers
could
have
been
computed
by
reference
to
the
income
tax
returns.
to
that
extent
to
sullivan
is
dispositive.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes
it
is
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
we
are
arguing
harmless
error
here
and
at
least
that
the
court
should
set
the
standards
for
harmless
error
if
it
does
not
decide
the
case
on
one
of
the
other
two
grounds
that
we
have
urged
in
our
brief.
if
i
may
and
if
the
court
will
indulge
me
for
one
more
minute,
i
would
like
to
finish
on
retroactivity
and
i
won’t
take
long.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
as
far
as
the
second
factor
reliance,
it
seems
to
us
clear
that
the
government
could
reasonably
have
relied
on
lewis
and
kahriger.
they
were
still
on
the
books
when
petitioner
was
tried
and
albertson
was
decided
almost
two
years
after
the
trial
ended.
in
fact,
petitioner
can’t
make
too
much
of
an
argument
regarding
reliance
because
he
himself
relies
on
lewis
and
kahriger
to
avoid
the
claim
of
waiver
in
this
case.
he
says
he
didn’t
raise
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
because
he
did
not
know
that
he
had
it.
and
so
there
can’t
be
any
serious
question
about
the
reliance
prong
of
the
three
factor
test.
finally,
with
regard
to
the
burden
on
the
administration
of
justice,
it
must
be
considered
if
marchetti-grosso
is
held
retroactive
that
collateral
attacks
maybe
brought
not
only
with
respect
to
convictions
failing
to
filed
wagering
tax
forms.
not
only
with
respect
to
convictions
of
income
tax
evasion
like
petitioner's
conviction
in
which
wagering
tax
forms
were
introduced
into
evidence,
but
also
as
to
convictions
under
the
comprehensive
prohibitory
scheme
both
federal
and
state
outlawing
gambling
and
gambling
related
activities
which
this
court
described
in
marchetti-grosso.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
in
mr.
justice
harlan’s
opinion,
one
of
the
reasons
that
he
rejected
the
restrictions
on
use
test
which
the
government
urged
in
marchetti-grosso
was
the
difficulty
that
states
would
have
in
showing
that
prosecutions
under
federal
and
state
law
for
gambling,
that
states
and
the
federal
government
would
have
would
be
--
they
could
not
show
that
they
were
untainted
because
of
the
filing
of
the
wagering
tax
forms.
here
if
this
court
holds
to
marchetti-grosso
retroactive,
that
issue
will
be
raised
with
respect
to
every
conviction
for
violation
of
federal
and
state
gambling
statutes
going
all
the
way
back
to
1951,
in
cases
in
which
wagering
tax
forms
were
filed.
we
urge
therefore
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
affirmed.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
mr.
justice.
it
has
been
served
and
he
is
out
on
parole
at
this
point.
but
i
think
your
question
points
up
really
another
aspect
of
the
retroactivity
of
marchetti-grosso
because
one
of
the
issues
that
is
involved
in
this
case
is
mr.
mackey’s
civil
income
tax
liability
and
if
this
court
were
to
affirm
the
judgment
below
under
settled
principles
of
collateral
estoppal,
mr.
mackey
would
be
liable
for
tax,
penalties
and
interests
amounting
to
about
a
million-and-a-half
dollars.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court
i
should
like
first
to
set
out
some
additional
facts
relating
to
petitioner’s
conviction
which
we
believe
are
essential
to
this
court’s
resolution
of
the
case.
as
has
been
noted,
the
government
proceeded
on
the
networth
method
of
proof.
under
the
government’s
proof,
petitioner’s
networth
increased
during
the
prosecution
years
by
more
than
million
dollars,
while
he
and
his
wife
reported
taxable
income
during
those
years
totaling
a
$143,000.00.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
five
years,
1956
through
60
inclusive.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
he
started
out
with
assets
of
roughly
$360,000.00
and
according
to
the
government's
computation
had
over
a
million
and
a
half
dollars
of
assets
at
the
end
of
the
prosecution
years.
but
in
terms
of
taxable
income
that
he
reported
a
$143,000.00.
the
principal
issue
at
the
trial
did
not
have
to
do
with
gambling,
the
issue
was
whether
the
government
was
justified
in
including
in
petitioner’s
networth,
certain
assets
which
petitioner’s
acquired
in
the
names
of
corporations
which
he
controlled,
in
the
names
of
friends,
relatives
and
even
a
fictitious
persons.
it
was
a
long
trial.
more
than
80
witnesses
testified
and
the
bulk
of
the
testimony
showed
that
petitioner
had
furnished
the
funds
for
the
purchase
of
assets
consisting
of
securities,
real
estate,
loans
and
mortgages
paying
for
these
assets
either
in
currency
or
with
cashier’s
checks.
the
largest
transaction
and
which
is
typical
except
for
the
dollars
involved
related
to
petitioners
acquisition
of
stock
in
a
fire
insurance
company.
he
first
paid
$50,000.00
in
currency
with
instructions
that
the
stock
be
issued
in
the
name
of
one
of
the
corporations
which
he
control.
later,
he
paid
an
additional
$98,000.00
in
currency
for
the
purchase
of
additional
shares
in
the
name
of
the
second
company
that
he
controlled,
and
still
later,
he
paid
$15,000.00
in
currency
for
additional
shares.
well,
this
was
the
largest
investment
he
made
during
the
prosecution
years.
the
government’s
proof
showed
that
on
literally
dozens
of
occasions,
he
purchased
assets
using
cash
or
cashier’s
checks.
the
largest
of
the
companies
which
petitioner
controlled
was
the
gibraltar
industrial
life
insurance
company
of
which
he
was
chairman
of
the
board.
petitioner’s
basic
contention
at
the
trial
in
this
case
was
that
the
assets
he
purchased
and
in
most
instances
had
registered
in
the
name
of
gibraltar
actually
with
the
property
of
gibraltar
and
therefore
could
not
be
included
in
his
net
worth,
but
the
income
tax
returns
that
gibraltar
filed
showed
that
the
corporation
operated
at
a
loss
during
the
prosecution
years
and
did
not
have
sufficient
capital
to
acquire
the
assets
which
petitioner
paid
for
during
those
years.
petitioner’s
sister
was
gibraltar’s
treasurer.
she
testified
on
direct
examination
by
the
government
at
gibraltar’s
books
and
records
reflected
all
receipts
of
that
company.
on
cross
examination
by
defense
counsel,
she
changed
her
testimony
and
explained
that
not
all
receipts
had
been
recorded.
additional
cash
was
available
to
gibraltar
she
said
because
insurance
premiums
paid
in
cash
by
policy
holders
were
not
taxable
and
therefore
where
not
recorded,
while
this
might
explain
why
the
receipts
were
not
included
on
gibraltar’s
income
tax
returns.
it
could
not
explain
the
absence
of
a
showing
of
these
receipts
on
the
books
and
records
of
gibraltar
and
on
the
reports
which
gibraltar
was
required
to
file
annually
with
the
department
of
insurance
of
the
state
of
indiana.
and
in
this
connection,
i’d
like
stress
one
point
that
while
the
investment
which
petitioner
said
belonged
to
gibraltar
but
which
were
unrecorded
on
its
books
and
records
were
paid
for
either
in
currency
or
cashier’s
checks,
that
corporation’s
expenses
were
with
rare
exception
paid
for
by
regular
bank
check.
this
then
in
brief
compass
was
the
government’s
proof
that
petitioner's
net
worth
has
increased
during
the
prosecution
years
by
substantially
more
than
can
be
accounted
for
by
the
taxable
income
reported
on
his
returns.
in
addition,
it
was
the
government’s
obligation
under
the
net
worth
method
to
show
a
likely
source
of
additional
taxable
income
that
could
account
for
the
net
worth
increase.
to
this
end
the
government
introduced
into
evidence,
petitioner's
income
tax
returns
for
1956
to
1960,
which
show
that
certain
of
his
income
came
from
being
a
“policy
operator”
and
in
one
instance
from
a
“policy
wheel”.
i’d
like
to
correct
one
factual
statement
that
mr.
ward
made
and
that
was
that
defense
counsel
did
not
object
to
the
introduction
into
evidence
of
the
schedule
c
forms.
he
did
object
on
the
grounds
of
prejudice
and
the
objection
was
overruled
and
the
income
tax
returns
were
admitted.
a
second
point
omitted
from
mr.
ward’s
statement
was
that
in
addition
to
the
schedule
c
forms
which
indicated
that
petitioner
was
in
the
policy
business,
there
was
the
testimony
of
an
internal
revenue
service
agent
that
in
the
course
of
his
investigation,
petitioner
admitted
that
he
was
in
the
gambling
business.
the
government
also
sought
to
introduce
petitioners
wagering
tax
forms
for
the
60-month
period
covered
by
the
indictment.
defense
counsel
objected
and
again
this
is
most
important,
the
objection
according
to
mr.
ward
was
based
on
the
ground
that
the
wagering
tax
forms
were
prejudicial,
but
it
was
also
based
on
the
ground
that
the
information
disclosed
in
the
forms
could
be
computed
by
reference
to
the
income
tax
returns.
that
is
that
they
showed
nothing
more
than
the
income
tax
returns
themselves.
the
government
attempted
to
introduce
the
wagering
tax
forms;
first,
during
the
course
of
the
testimony
of
the
first
witness
who
had
prepared
petitioner’s
income
tax
returns.
these
forms
were
not
mentioned
again
until
more
than
60
witnesses
had
testified
regarding
petitioner's
cash
transactions,
and
this
was
during
the
course
of
testimony
of
petitioner’s
secretary.
on
both
occasions,
the
court
reserved
ruling
on
the
ground
that
the
government
had
not
shown
that
the
forms
were
not
merely
cumulative
of
the
information
that
appeared
in
the
income
tax
returns,
not
until
the
government’s
last
witness
testified
was
there
further
mentioned
of
the
wagering
tax
forms.
defense
counsel
again
objected
to
admission
of
the
forms
on
the
ground
both
that
they
were
prejudicial
and
cumulative
of
what
was
in
the
income
tax
returns.
now,
the
forms
which
are
reproduced
in
the
appendix
which
is
on
file
with
this
court,
show
have
an
entry
and
i
am
reading
form
page
41
of
the
appendix,
the
gross
amount
of
wagers
accepted
during
the
month
--
page
41
mr.
justice.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
right.
they
were
involved
here
though,
and
so
far
as
i
know,
well,
we
do
not
have
all
the
forms
reproduced
here.
i
am
not
aware
of
any
layoff
so
that
that
was
an
issue
in
the
case.
so,
those
figures
if
you
add
up,
if
you
take
12
months
wagering
tax
forms
and
add
up
the
gross
receipts
figures
on
those
12
forms
presumably,
that
should
be
the
figure
that
should
go
into
gross
receipts
on
schedule
c
of
the
income
tax
returns,
gross
receipts
and
that’s
the
line
reads,
gross
receipts
on
schedule
c.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
income
from
a
business
or
profession,
it
is
filed
by
an
individual
proprietor.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
someone
who
is
employed
wouldn’t
have
to
bother
with
that
form.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
believe
you
did
mr.
chief
justice
and
i
hope
to
–-
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes
sir.
this
is
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
the
court
said
in
marchetti
and
grosso
that
this
was
a
revenue
measure,
but
that
because
of
the
inter
relationship
of
the
wagering
tax
information
that
had
to
be
furnished
and
the
comprehensive
scheme
of
federal
and
states
statutes
prohibiting
gambling
and
gambling
related
activities
that
the
privilege
would
be
a
complete
defense
if
the
forms
were
not
filed.
i
would
like
though
to
make
the
point
because
i
don’t
think
it's
clear
as
to
what
the
income
tax
returns
showed
because
i
think
that
this
is
critical
to
this
case.
if
i
were
preparing
an
income
tax
return
and
i
have
a
wagering
tax
forms
in
front
of
me,
i
would
take
the
12
forms
and
i
would
add
up
the
figures
from
each
one
and
put
it
down
in
the
gross
receipts
line
on
the
income
tax
return.
that
is
not
what
was
done
here.
the
figure
that
appears
on
the
income
tax
returns
is
substantially
smaller,
the
gross
receipts
figure
that
is
substantially
smaller
than
the
sum
of
any
12
months
wagering
tax
forms.
but
the
reason
for
defense
counsel’s
objection
was
not
only
the
prejudice,
it
was
that
it
was
cumulative
and
the
reason
for
this
is
that
on
the
income
tax
return
in
addition
to
the
gross
receipts
figure,
there
is
a
space
for
deductions
and
one
of
the
deductions
that
petitioner
claimed
was
a
deduction
for
the
excise
taxes
paid.
in
other
words,
the
sum
of
the
excise
taxes
paid
for
the
12-month
period
appeared
as
a
deduction
on
the
income
tax
return.
and
basically,
the
argument
that
was
made
by
petitioner’s
counsel
at
the
trial
was,
well
the
jury
can
compute
this
itself.
all
it
has
to
do
is
to
take
the
excise
tax
deduction
again
which
on
this
form
if
you
add
up
12
forms,
add
up
the
deductions
that
show
on
12
forms
which
is
10%
of
the
gross.
that
figure
appeared
on
the
income
tax
return
as
a
deduction.
so
defense
counsel’s
arguments
as
to
that
it
didn’t
shown
anything
more
was,
let
the
jury
and
multiply
the
excise
tax
deduction
by
10
and
then
they
themselves
can
see
what
the
gross
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes
it
is
mr.
justice.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
it
is
and
it
was
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
it
is
the
cost
of
doing
business.
it
is
a
cost
of
doing
business.
and
it
is
deductible
and
it
was
claimed.
and
so,
it
wasn’t
only
the
prejudice
ground
that
the
defense
counsel
objected
on.
he
said
it
was
cumulative,
let
the
jury
multiply
by
10
and
then
they
will
know
that
the
gross
receipts
figure
which
was
only
a
fraction
of
the
total
gross
receipts
shown
on
the
wagering
tax
forms
was
substantially
larger.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
think
very
frankly
mr.
chief
justice.
i
am
speaking
as
a
matter
of
hind
side.
i
think
that
the
summary
form
to
which
mr.
ward
referred
earlier,
this
form
765
which
is
a
summary
exhibit
of
all
the
wagering
tax
forms
could
have
been
computed
by
reference
to
the
income
tax
returns
alone.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
from
the
wagering
tax
forms,
the
schedule
c
and
we
have
asked
the
government
prosecutor
why
did
you
pushed
to
put
this
in.
he
said
why
should
not
i
push,
louis
and
cargo
was
on
the
books
and
this
was
good
evidence,
and
it
highlighted
the
opportunities
that
a
gambler
has
to
since
he
is
always
dealing
in
cash
to
hide
income,
but
we
had
here
evidence
that
he
was
a
gambler
from
the
income
tax
returns.
the
evidence
of
the
revenue
agent
and
also
the
fact
that
this
could
have
been
computed
admittedly
not
as
vividly
for
the
jury
by
reference
to
the
income
tax
returns.
that
is
one
of
the
grounds
on
which
defense
counsel
objected
to
admission
of
the
evidence
on
trial.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
multiplying
the
excise
tax
deduction
by
10
and
subtracting
from
the
product
of
that
multiplication,
the
figure
that
was
shown
as
gross
receipts
on
the
income
tax
returns.
now,
that
wouldn’t
have
accounted
for
all
the
income
that
was
missing.
a
question
was
asked
if
mr.
ward
is
the
government’s
position
that
the
wagering
tax
forms
are
right
or
wrong.
or
we
really
do
not
know
whether
they
were
right
or
wrong.
they
didn’t
account
for
$4,000.00
a
week
of
cash
which
is
about
what
it
works
out
was
missing
from
petitioner’s
income
tax
returns,
roughly
$200,000.00
a
year.
we
do
not
know
if
the
net
figure
was
right
or
not,
but
we
didn’t
have
to
prove
whether
it
was
right.
all
we
have
to
show
was
a
likely
source
of
income.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that
is
right,
but
they
all
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
right.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
but
the
fact
is
mr.
justice
stewart
that
defense
counsel
had
a
point
in
saying
this
could
have
been
computed
by
multiplying
the
excise
tax
deduction
which
was
also
on
the
income
tax
returns
by
10.
and
you
would
have
again
had
this
inflated
gross
receipts
figure.
the
two
just
weren't
consistent
and
there
were
other
deductions
claimed
on
the
income
tax
returns.
i
have
examined
those.
mr.
justice
white,
i
believe
you
asked
the
question
regarding
that.
he
claims
deductions
for
cost
of
supplies
and
other
deductions,
but
he
only
showed
the
net
figure
in
the
gross
receipts
column
on
the
schedule
c.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
think
we’d
still
be
given
mr.
justice
harlan.
our
position
is
that
at
the
time
that
these
wagering
tax
forms
were
filed,
there
was
no
certainty
that
they
would
prove
a
significant
link
in
the
chain
of
evidence
tending
to
convict
petitioner
of
income
tax
evasion.
and
we
say
this
--mr.
ward
has
referred
to
waterfront
--
the
murphy
and
waterfront
commission
case
and
the
very
broad
language
that
was
used
in
that
case
regarding
any
use
of
testimony
compelled
in
violation
of
the
privilege.
and
i
would
like
to
put
a
hypothetical
to
the
court
regarding
murphy
and
waterfront
commission
which
shows
we
think
despite
the
broad
language
that
there
are
some
limits,
let
us
suppose
that
a
commission
is
convened
to
examine
bribery
by
public
officials.
and
i
am
called
to
testify
before
this
commission
today,
october
21,
and
i
testify
that
after
invoking
my
privilege
and
having
my
claim
rejected
and
so
forth
that
on
march
15th
of
this
year,
i
accepted
a
$5,000.00
bribe
for
engaging
in
some
nefarious
activity
in
connection
with
my
employment.
now,
next,
april
15
comes
and
i
have
to
file
my
income
tax
return.
if
i
don’t
include
that
$5,000.00
as
an
income,
i
would
suggest,
that
murphy
and
the
waterfront
commission
doesn’t
necessarily
resolved
the
question
whether
the
privilege
in
that
case
would
bar
the
introduction
of
my
prior
testimony
because
the
theme
running
through
this
court’s
decision
in
the
self-incrimination
area
has
been
that
unless
it
will
surely
proved
a
significant
link
in
the
chain
of
evidence
tending
to
convict,
the
privilege
shall
not
apply.
and
so
we
say
that
even
in
the
case
you
posited
mr.
justice,
we
think
we’d
be
here.
i
would
like
at
this
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that
is
correct.
we
couldn’t
have
gotten
these
in
under
ricardo
if
the
gross
receipts
figure
and
the
tax
deduction
figures
tide
in
with
the
income
tax
returns
because
then
i
think
the
argument
as
to
prejudice
and
again,
this
would
be
in
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judge.
he
has
to
weigh
the
possible
effect
on
the
jury
of
the
disclosure
of
gambling
against
the
additional
contribution
that
the
evidence
might
make.
so
i
think
we
would
have
had
a
very
difficult
time
getting
in
the
way
using
tax
forms,
had
they
been
consistent
with
the
later
filed
income
tax
returns.
it
was
only
the
later
act
of
showing
a
smaller
gross
receipts
figure
on
the
income
tax
returns
that
made
the
wagering
tax
forms
at
all
relevant
in
this
trial.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
if
he
hadn’t
filed
the
wagering
tax
forms
at
all?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
the
point
of
the
question.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
right.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
right,
i
assume
he
would
not
have
claimed
the
deduction.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
do
not
think
that
is
right
mr.
justice.
it
seems
to
me
that
nothing
was
triggered
by
the
wagering
tax
forms.
the
last
one
was
filed
for
any
given
year.
let
us
say
1956
on
january
31,
1957
on
or
before
that
date
and
his
income
tax
return
was
not
filed
until
later
and
i
don’t
think
at
that
point
that
they
triggered
anything.
looking
at
it
on
january
31st
of
any
given
year
with
respect
to
the
prior
year,
i
don’t
think
they
triggered
anything.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that
he
did
not
claim
the
deduction?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
think
in
that
case
--
i
think
first
of
all,
let
me
just
say
i
think
that
is
an
extremely
unlikely
hypothetical
that
you
wouldn’t
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
for
the
gross
receipts,
if
he
did
not
claim
the
deduction,
yes.
but
that’s
not
this
case.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
we
don’t
think
that
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
would
say
on
that
issue
mr.
justice
marshall
that
what
the
court
was
concerned
about
in
marchetti
and
grosso
was
the
comprehensive
scheme
of
federal
and
state
gambling
statutes,
anti-gambling
statutes,
and
the
fact
that
possible
disclosures
merely
this
form
showing
gross
receipts
and
a
deduction
would
be
enough
to
incriminate
somebody
for
violations
of
some
of
these
statutes,
but
that’s
not
this
case.
these
forms
could
not
incriminate
anybody
of
income
tax
evasion
unless
they
were
not
consistent
with
the
later
filed
income
tax
returns,
and
i
think
the
proper
way
to
look
at
it,
is
to
say
what
was
the
situation
on
january
31
of
any
year?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
of
course
not,
of
course
not.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
in
terms
of
income
tax
deduction?
he
did.
i
supposed
he
would
argue
that
he
subjected
himself
to
self-incrimination
for
federal
and
state
anti-gambling
statute,
but
this
is
not
this
case
mr.
chief
justice.
in
the
few
minutes
i
have
remaining
i
would
like
to
turn
briefly
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
in
marchetti
and
grosso?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
no
mr.
justice,
we’re
not.
we’re
saying
that
it
simply
doesn’t
extend
to
this
case
that
the
premises
on
which
marchetti-grosso
was
decided
was
this
conflict
between
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
comprehensive
scheme
of
federal
and
state
anti-gambling
statutes
on
the
other
hand.
and
we’re
not
involved
with
this
comprehensive
scheme
in
this
case.
we’re
involved
with
income
tax
evasion.
and
we
say
that
marchetti-grosso's
rationale
does
not
extend
to
this
case
because
at
the
time,
the
wagering
tax
forms
were
filed,
it
could
not
be
said
as
it
could
be
said
in
marchetti
and
grosso,
that
they
would
surely
prove
a
significant
link
in
the
chain
of
evidence
tending
to
convict
petitioner
of
income
tax
evasion.
it
was
only
the
later
act
of
filing
an
inconsistent
income
tax
return
that
made
these
forms
at
all
relevant
in
this
prosecution.
and
we
say
despite
the
broad
language
in
murphy
and
the
waterfront
commission
regarding
any
use
of
compelled
testimony,
that
question
is
an
open
one
and
warrants
serious
consideration
by
this
court.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that
is
one
of
our
arguments
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
that
is
correct.
now,
i
would
like
to
spend
my
last
five
minutes
on
the
retroactive
aspect
and
i
would
like
to
turn
first,
if
i
may
to
the
test
that
was
proposed
by
mr.
justice
harlan
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
the
desist
case
and
we
submit
that
under
that
test,
there
would
be
no
basis
for
retroactivity
in
this
case.
we
say
first
but
since
this
is
a
collateral
proceeding
under
section
2255,
the
first
inquiry
that
must
be
made
is
whether
this
rule
of
marchetti-grosso
is
one
that
improves
the
fact
finding
process
and
it
seems
clear
to
us
under
mr.
justice
harlan’s
test
that
it
does
quite
the
contrary.
it
worsens
the
fact
finding
process
because
it
excludes
evidence
that
is
plainly
trustworthy
and
plainly
reliable.
second,
mr.
justice
harlan
would
ask
is
this
a
new
rule
or
an
old
rule?
and
we
think
contrary
to
what
mr.
ward
has
said
earlier
that
it
is
clearly
a
new
rule.
there
was
a
time
when
lewis
and
kahriger
were
on
the
books,
when
this
case
would
not
be
here
because
it
would
be
clear
that
the
wagering
tax
forms
were
admissible.
finally,
mr.
justice
harlan
would
say
we
have
to
look
at
the
law
that
existed
at
the
time
the
conviction
became
final
in
this
case.
and
the
conviction
became
final
in
this
case
on
october
11,
1965,
when
this
court
denied
petitioner's
petition
for
certiorari
on
direct
appeal.
no
petition
for
rehearing
was
filed
from
that
denial
and
albertson
was
not
decided
until
november
15th,
1965.
so
that
even
if
one
could
argue
that
the
viability
of
lewis
and
kahriger
was
placed
in
question
by
albertson.
petitioner
would
not
be
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
marchetti-grosso
under
mr.
justice
harlan’s
analysis.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes
sir,
i
am.
and
under
your
analysis
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
no
sir,
but
i
apply
the
test
that
you
say
you
would
apply,
if
you
had
more
than
one
vote
and
under
that
test,
it
seems
clear
to
us
that
marchetti-grosso
would
not
be
retroactive.
that’s
only
preliminary.
i
might
add
that
we
think
the
result
is
the
same
under
the
three
factor
test
which
this
court
has
followed
beginning
with
the
link
letter
case.
the
purpose
of
marchetti-grosso
is
to
protect
the
constitutional
privilege
against
the
statutory
system
jeopardizing
it.
that
statutory
system
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
petitioner
has
not
been
prosecuted
for
any
violation
of
a
federal
or
state
anti-gambling
statute.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
the
constitutional
privilege
against
the
statutory
system
that
jeopardizes
it
and
that
statutory
system
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
in
this
case,
the
comprehensive
federal
and
state
anti-gambling
provisions
are
just
not
involved.
and
furthermore
to
the
extent
that
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
rests
on
notions
of
an
individual’s
right
of
privacy.
the
invasion
of
that
privacy
cannot
now
be
restored
by
according
marchetti-grosso
retroactive
effect.
finally,
and
most
important
in
terms
of
the
purpose
criteria
in
which
this
court
has
stressed,
the
marchetti-grosso
rule
does
not
go
to
the
integrity
of
the
fact
finding
process.
we
think
the
evidence
here
is
far
more
reliable
than
the
evidence
involved
in
johnson
against
new
jersey
which
held
that
miranda
was
not
retroactive.
the
plain
fact
is
that
nobody
files
wagering
tax
forms
who
does
not
have
to
file
them
and
nobody
puts
a
figure
down
on
a
wagering
tax
form
for
gross
receipts
that's
higher
than
it
has
to
be.
we
think
it
is
clear
that
the
--
at
the
very
minimum
petitioner
had
gross
receipts
from
wagering
as
shown
on
his
wagering
tax
forms.
we
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
trustworthiness
and
reliability
of
the
evidence
here
is
almost
as
great
as
it
was
in
linkletter
and
desist.
petitioner
attempts
to
avoid
the
rule
of
the
johnson
case
which
we
think
is
controlling
and
that
of
tehan
and
shott
on
the
ground
that
he
comes
within
the
holding
of
johnson
and
deno.
in
short
that
this
is
a
coerce
confession
case.
we
think
this
argument
was
adequately
answered
by
the
court
below.
i’d
like
to
quote
briefly
from
the
first
full
paragraph
on
page
53
of
the
appendix.
defendant
contends
however
that
the
wagering
tax
returns
constitute
coerce
confessions
since
they
were
filed
under
the
compulsion
of
a
legal
command
and
that
retroactivity
follows
automatically
once
the
question
is
so
characterized,
but
the
compulsion
which
turns
interrogation
into
a
violation
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
is
not
the
same
as
the
coercion
and
intimidation
which
makes
a
confession
involuntary
and
a
denial
of
due
process.
and
at
this
point,
the
court
cited
davis
v.
north
carolina
which
was
decided
on
the
same
day
as
johnson
and
showed
precisely
what
the
court
was
pointing
out
but
not
every
self-incrimination
case
is
a
coerce
confession
case
and
this
is
not
a
coerce
confession
case
under
any
standards
that
this
court
has
applied.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
am
not
sure
(voice
overlap)
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
would
like
to
say
that
completely
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
don’t
quite
think
i
can,
except
to
the
extent
that
i
can
show
that
the
gross
receipts
figure
could
have
been
computed.
the
gross
receipts
figure
from
wagers
could
have
been
computed
by
reference
to
the
income
tax
returns.
to
that
extent
to
sullivan
is
dispositive.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes
it
is
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
we
are
arguing
harmless
error
here
and
at
least
that
the
court
should
set
the
standards
for
harmless
error
if
it
does
not
decide
the
case
on
one
of
the
other
two
grounds
that
we
have
urged
in
our
brief.
if
i
may
and
if
the
court
will
indulge
me
for
one
more
minute,
i
would
like
to
finish
on
retroactivity
and
i
won’t
take
long.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
as
far
as
the
second
factor
reliance,
it
seems
to
us
clear
that
the
government
could
reasonably
have
relied
on
lewis
and
kahriger.
they
were
still
on
the
books
when
petitioner
was
tried
and
albertson
was
decided
almost
two
years
after
the
trial
ended.
in
fact,
petitioner
can’t
make
too
much
of
an
argument
regarding
reliance
because
he
himself
relies
on
lewis
and
kahriger
to
avoid
the
claim
of
waiver
in
this
case.
he
says
he
didn’t
raise
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
because
he
did
not
know
that
he
had
it.
and
so
there
can’t
be
any
serious
question
about
the
reliance
prong
of
the
three
factor
test.
finally,
with
regard
to
the
burden
on
the
administration
of
justice,
it
must
be
considered
if
marchetti-grosso
is
held
retroactive
that
collateral
attacks
maybe
brought
not
only
with
respect
to
convictions
failing
to
filed
wagering
tax
forms.
not
only
with
respect
to
convictions
of
income
tax
evasion
like
petitioner's
conviction
in
which
wagering
tax
forms
were
introduced
into
evidence,
but
also
as
to
convictions
under
the
comprehensive
prohibitory
scheme
both
federal
and
state
outlawing
gambling
and
gambling
related
activities
which
this
court
described
in
marchetti-grosso.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
in
mr.
justice
harlan’s
opinion,
one
of
the
reasons
that
he
rejected
the
restrictions
on
use
test
which
the
government
urged
in
marchetti-grosso
was
the
difficulty
that
states
would
have
in
showing
that
prosecutions
under
federal
and
state
law
for
gambling,
that
states
and
the
federal
government
would
have
would
be
--
they
could
not
show
that
they
were
untainted
because
of
the
filing
of
the
wagering
tax
forms.
here
if
this
court
holds
to
marchetti-grosso
retroactive,
that
issue
will
be
raised
with
respect
to
every
conviction
for
violation
of
federal
and
state
gambling
statutes
going
all
the
way
back
to
1951,
in
cases
in
which
wagering
tax
forms
were
filed.
we
urge
therefore
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
affirmed.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
mr.
justice.
it
has
been
served
and
he
is
out
on
parole
at
this
point.
but
i
think
your
question
points
up
really
another
aspect
of
the
retroactivity
of
marchetti-grosso
because
one
of
the
issues
that
is
involved
in
this
case
is
mr.
mackey’s
civil
income
tax
liability
and
if
this
court
were
to
affirm
the
judgment
below
under
settled
principles
of
collateral
estoppal,
mr.
mackey
would
be
liable
for
tax,
penalties
and
interests
amounting
to
about
a
million-and-a-half
dollars.
