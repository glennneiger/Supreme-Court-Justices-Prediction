mr.
michael
r.
juviler
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
--
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
was
no
seizure
of
the
flag
constructions
and
the
proof
of
guilt
was
established
primarily
by
photographs
taken
at
the
gallery.
these
photographs
are
included
in
the
original
record
and
mr.
seaver
is
been
kind
enough
to
obtain
them
here
in
the
court.
i
think
it
might
be
convenient
if
these
are
passed
up
to
the
court
because
i'd
like
to
refer
to
them,
some
of
them
during
my
oral
argument.
the
immediate
question
presented
by
this
case
is
the
extent
to
which
the
people
while
preserving
the
liberties
that
the
flag
stands
for
may
also
take
steps
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
the
flag
as
a
national
symbol
of
general
use.
whatever
place
this
case
finds
in
constitutional
history,
will
probably
be
attributable
however
to
a
broader
question
and
that
is
the
difficult
balancing
between
pure
speech
and
symbolic
conduct
that
has
attracted
the
attention
of
this
court
in
several
cases
in
recent
years.
because
the
statute
here
in
question
involves
casting
contempt
by
act
and
the
trial
court
specifically
found
that
the
appellant's
constructions
or
the
display
of
these
constructions
cast
contempt
by
act.
every
state
has
a
statute
in
some
way
of
prescribing
the
acts
which
maybe
addressed
to
the
flag.
congress
recently
has
enacted
a
statute
which
in
many
ways
is
similar
to
the
new
york
law.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
i
would
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
the
defendant
was
charged
with
mutilation
--
with
the
general
language
of
the
subdivision
(d)
of
the
penal
law.
the
court
found
only
that
he
cast
contempt
by
act.
there
was
no
evidence
and
indeed
it
was
not
the
people's
theory
that
appellant
himself
mutilated
the
flag.
the
evidence
was
that
it
was
another
person,
the
artist
who
had
used
the
flag.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
the
act
was
the
display
of
a
physically
altered
actual
flag,
and
the
permission
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes
and
the
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
the
causing
of
this
display
and
the
permitting
this
display
to
continue
including
the
day
on
which
the
summons
was
issued.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
an
act
as
opposed
to
words.
appellant
was
not
prosecuted
for
anything
that
he
said
or
indeed
for
any
belief
that
he
may
have
had.
we
do
not
know
in
this
record
what
appellant's
beliefs
are,
although
he
did
testify
as
to
his
opinion
as
to
the
artist's
intention.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
that
would
be
an
easier
case
i
think
to
defend,
and
there
is
a
case
like
that
on
its
way
to
this
court
from
new
york
where
a
person
in
public
burned
the
flag.
the
way
we
analyze
this
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes,
but
the
way
we
analyze
this
problem
of
its
freedom
of
expression,
there's
a
continuum
between
conduct,
pure
conduct
and
pure
speech
words.
if
the
state
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
there
would
be
no
statute
as
--
that
i
know
of
that
would
prevent
that
other
some
law
dealing
with
fire
regulations.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
no,
this
law
deals
only
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
not
unless
this
act
occurred
in
public
--
there
was
some
public
act.
now
in
this
case
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
i
doubt
--
i
don't
know.
i
have
to
--
would
have
to
know
the
facts
as
to
whether
this
was
deem
to
cast
contempt
on
the
flag.
in
this
particular
case,
there's
no
dispute
that
there
was
a
public
event.
indeed,
as
one
of
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes,
this
has
to
be
public.
this
cannot
be
--
the
statute
does
not
apply
to
acts
in
private.
a
person
under
this
law
and
congress'
law
could
burn
the
flag
in
his
own
home
or
to
private
party.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
i
think
that
historically,
the
impetus
was
the
misuse
of
the
flag
in
some
political
campaigns
and
commercial
advertising
after
the
civil
war.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes,
the
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
historically,
i
don't
know
what
the
reason
is.
it
may
have
been
that
congress
felt
that
the
states
were
better
equipped
through
local
law
enforcement
to
deal
with
this.
in
halter
against
nebraska
in
1907,
this
court
said
that
the
state
does
have
an
interest,
because
the
states
derive
their
existence
from
the
union
and
the
flag
represents
that
union.
four
members
of
this
court
in
dissent
in
the
street
case
appear
to
have
accepted
the
state
interest
in
this
area
and
the
recent
congressional
law
specifically
leaves
to
the
states
the
power
to
make
these
regulations.
the
ability
of
a
state
or
federal
government
to
regulate
conduct
that
has
expressive
elements
was
recognized
in
the
o'brien
case,
the
draft
card
burning
case,
and
there
are
two
main
tests
set
forth
in
that
case
which
we
contend
were
fulfilled
here
to
justify
the
state
regulation.
the
first
is
that
there
be
a
sufficient
governmental
interest
in
regulating
the
conduct
element.
and
if
this
interest
exists,
an
incidental
affect
on
some
expressive
element
maybe
tolerated
under
the
first
amendment.
and
the
second
principle
requirement
is
that
the
regulation
not
be
directed
to
suppression
of
expression.
as
we
proceed
to
argue,
both
of
these
tests
were
satisfied
by
the
new
york
law.
one
governmental
interest
which
is
served
by
the
new
york
law,
the
federal
law
and
the
laws
in
all
of
the
other
states
is
the
preservation
of
the
integrity
of
the
flag
as
a
viable
national
symbol
for
general
use
by
all
of
the
public.
as
was
said
in
dissent
in
the
street
case,
the
flag
is
a
special
kind
of
personalty.
it
is
dedicated
to
a
certain
use
by
public
action
and
as
such,
it
is
off
limits
for
certain
physical
acts
of
destruction
or
contemptuous
desecration
in
public,
just
as
the
walls
of
a
federal
building
are
off
limits
for
the
inscription
of
political
or
social
commentary.
appellant
would
dismiss
this
vital
area
of
human
experience,
the
symbolic
area,
the
symbolic
interest
and
yet,
his
case
is
based
on
his
assertion
of
his
own
right
to
assert
symbolic
values
as
an
exhibitor
of
art.
there
seems
to
be
no
basis
presented
by
appellant
on
which
this
court
can
say.
and
indeed,
this
court
has
never
suggested
that
there
is
no
valid
public
interest
in
preserving
this
general
symbolic
use
of
the
flag
as
a
national
symbol.
the
more
difficult
question
here
is
whether
the
new
york
law
is
unrelated
to
the
suppression
of
free
expression.
i'm
talking
now
of
the
specific
provision
that
is
at
issue
here,
the
provision
preventing
casting
contempt
on
the
flag
by
an
act,
because
contempt
is
in
a
sense
expression
and
that
expression
is
specifically
the
corpus
of
the
crime
that
is
defined
by
this
statute,
but
this
contempt
is
not
a
view
on
an
issue.
the
flag
is
neutral
on
political
and
social
questions,
and
the
statutes
aimed
at
protecting
the
flag
by
the
same
token
are
also
neutral
in
terms
of
expressing
views
of
the
type
that
are
recognized
as
having
value
in
the
free
marketplace
of
ideas.
the
flag
has
its
place
at
the
head
of
a
parade
of
hard
hats
and
it
has
its
place
at
the
head
of
a
procession
of
peace
marchers,
so
that
the
legislation
dealing
with
the
flag
takes
no
position
on
political
questions.
the
law
does
not
say
that
you
may
not
cast
contempt
on
the
government.
unlike
the
congressional
enactment
at
issue
in
the
shack
case,
it
does
not
say
that
you
may
not
discredit
the
armed
forces.
the
armed
forces
are
not
--
discrediting
the
armed
forces
is
not
a
neutral
position.
it
is
a
very
vital
part
of
political
controversy.
the
fag
is
unique.
it
is
a
kind
of
personalty
that
extends
beyond
the
ownership
of
the
particular
actor,
and
it
is
a
neutral
personalty.
as
the
statute
was
applied
in
this
particular
case,
there
is
another
interest
which
is
certainly
as
important
as
the
interest
in
permitting
free-floating
abstract
contempt
by
acts
toward
the
flag.
and
that
is
the
interest
in
freedom
of
choice
of
the
citizens
as
to
whether
they
shall
have
in
their
community
publicly
displayed
uses
of
the
flag
that
are
offensive
to
a
large
part
of
the
community.
your
honors
will
not
that
in
people's
exhibit
1,
a
black
and
white
photograph
taken
from
the
street
facing
the
appellant's
gallery,
one
of
these
constructions
hanging
the
flag
in
effigy
by
the
neck
like
a
corpse
was
exhibited
for
three
weeks
in
a
prominent
position
facing
a
major
new
york
city
thorough
fair,
madison
avenue.
it
is
absurd
to
suggest
that
there
is
no
evidence
that
this
was
visible
to
many
persons
passing
on
madison
avenue.
and
the
question
here
is
whether
the
ability
to
rent
space
in
a
prominent
display
position,
gives
the
right
to
put
in
there
any
visual
materials
for
any
amount
of
time
regardless
of
other
means
of
presenting
the
same
expression
in
manners
which
are
less
of
an
assault
on
the
citizens.
the
very
basic
right
to
be
free
from
sights
and
tangible
matter
that
we
do
not
want
was
the
language
used
recently
by
this
court
in
rowan
against
post
office;
that
involved
privacy
in
the
home,
but
there
is
privacy,
some
interest
in
privacy
and
freedom
of
choice
in
the
public
streets.
if
this
law
is
applied
in
such
a
context,
there
is
no
substantial
question
of
the
subject's
rights
under
the
first
amendment.
the
sidewalk
speaker
is
not
comparable
to
the
renter
of
space,
because
the
sidewalk
speaker
has
really
little
alternative
to
present
his
discourse
to
the
public,
and
he
is
not
there
generally
for
three
weeks.
presumably,
if
the
speaker
uses
electronic
equipment
which
broadcast
his
utterances
loudly
and
raucously
in
the
street
and
in
the
--
into
the
homes
in
the
neighborhood,
there
would
be
a
right
to
regulate
that,
so
long
as
the
regulation
is
not
directed
to
the
ideas
or
the
content
in
that
sense
of
his
utterances.
and
we
ask
the
court
not
to
say,
not
to
create
by
a
decision
here
another
example
of
a
captive
audience.
there
are
alternatives
for
expressing
the
views
which
appellant
ascribed
to
the
artist
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
it
would
be
much
harder
to
defend
such
a
prosecution.
the
statute
as
written
would
apply,
i
would
say,
and
it
has
been
so
held
in
this
case.
if
the
voluntary
audience
is
still
a
public
audience
in
terms
of
the
interest
that
i've
discussed
in
preserving
the
validity
of
the
flag
as
a
symbol,
there
is
more
to
say
for
that
interest
if
the
flag
is
in
a
sense
misused
in
the
public
street
than
it
is
in
a
private/public
gallery.
but
that
is
the
facts
that
are
--
those
are
the
facts
presented
by
this
record,
and
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
made
clear
that
this
display
in
the
window
was
a
separable
and
sufficient
ground
for
finding
a
violation
of
this
statute,
even
though
they
also
said
that
the
other
constructions
particularly
the
one
using
the
actual
flag
as
a
penis
inside
the
gallery
also
violated
the
statute
and
cast
contempt
by
act.
contrary
to
the
appellant's
argument,
there
was
evidence
from
appellant
himself
that
that
construction
used
part
of
the
american
flag,
the
actual
american
flag
and
there
is
other
testimony
that
this
was
not
a
homemade
flag.
this
was
an
actual
three-dimensional
american
flag.
the
photographs
themselves
show
that
beyond
any
question.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
i'm
--
by
homemade,
i
mean
something
that
is
not
of
cloth
banner
but
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
no,
no
difference,
but
what
we
have
in
this
particular
case
is
an
actual
american
flag.
the
relevancy
of
that
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes,
that
would
violate
the
statute
as
it
did
in
the
street
case
--
as
it
could
have
done
in
the
street
case.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes.
i
suppose
one
has
to
say
that
if
this
is
reasonably
considered
to
be
a
contemporary
american
flag,
the
present
symbol
of
government
in
essence
as
a
question
of
fact,
then
the
statute
could
apply
and
if
it
does
apply
that
it
so
held
to
apply
by
the
state
court
as
a
question
of
fact,
there
is
no
first
amendment
question.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
the
statute
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
--
as
written,
it
covers
that,
but
in
essence,
that
part
of
a
statute
has
been
written
off
as
a
result
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
street
case.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
and
the
court
of
appeals
so
held
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes.
because
of
this
now
settled
distinction
drawn
by
this
court
between
symbolic
conduct
that
has
conduct
elements
and
pure
speech
on
the
one
hand.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
it's
probably
the
--
it
might
well
be
the
same
interest,
but
in
the
one
sense
dealing
with
words,
that
interest
has
been
deemed
to
be
subordinate
to
the
first
amendment.
that
hasn't
been
the
case
as
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes,
that
is
the
second
major
public
interest,
if
that's
what
your
honor
is
referring
to,
the
interest
in
preserving
order
and
preventing
a
breach
of
the
peace.
in
the
street
case
that
was
argued
in
defense
of
the
statute
and
the
majority
of
this
court
felt
that
on
that
record,
there
was
insufficient
evidence
to
justify
that
interest
dealing
with
words
when
one
comes
to
words.
and
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
as
we
here,
are
bound
by
the
majority
opinions
in
the
street
case.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes.
our
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
the
two
interests
are
the
interest
in
preserving
this
national
symbol
when
the
display
involves
particularly
the
actual
flag.
and
secondly,
the
interest
referred
to
by
the
court
of
appeals,
and
that
is
the
interest
in
preserving
order
preventing
disturbance
through
in
effect
fighting
acts
as
opposed
to
fighting
words.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
in
terms
of
the
fighting
act,
fighting
word?
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
well,
the
court
has
--
perhaps
you're
right
that
the
court
has
taken
a
tougher
position.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
in
the
street
case
for
example
when
the
majority
of
this
court
felt
that
the
conviction
of
street
may
have
rested
on
his
utterances.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
burning.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
no.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes.
i
presume
if
the
manufacturing
of
these
constructions
had
gone
on
in
the
window
of
the
gallery,
there
would
be
a
more
direct
observable
application
of
this
concept
of
conduct,
but
a
display
is
conduct
in
a
sense.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes,
a
display
can
be
conduct
if
the
statute
that
deals
with
display
is
addressed
to
the
non-speech
elements
of
that
conduct.
now
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
the
use
of
the
actual
flag,
a
physical
object.
there
was
a
case
that
came
to
this
court
in
which
no
substantial
federal
question
was
found,
and
the
appeal
was
dismissed.
in
this
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
in
this
--
well,
that's
one.
i'm
talking
of
the
stover
case
that
also
arose
in
new
york,
where
to
protest
taxes
in
a
town,
the
defendant
flew
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
some
dirty
laundry.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
now,
the
chief
judge
full,
then
judge
full
writing
for
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
there
was
a
conduct
element
even
though
this
was
merely
a
display
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes,
indeed
there
was.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
by
the
majority,
i
would
say
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
by
the
legislature
itself
made
a
finding
that
a
public
display
of
a
physical
flag
that
cast
contempt
on
the
flag
is
a
nuisance
in
that
sense.
it
is
an
act.
it
has
a
conduct
element
unrelated
to
the
political
or
social
views
expressed.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
that
made
--
that
can
be
regulated.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
well,
we
have
--
the
statute
has
been
applied
in
this
case
to
a
display.
that
has
--
that
becomes
the
law
of
this
case.
and
i
think
the
question
now
is
not
what
the
statute
means
in
terms
state
law,
but
whether
the
first
amendment
permits
such
an
application
of
the
statute.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
no.
i
know
of
know
such
case.
but
we
say
this
is
a
case
where
the
conduct
can
be
proscribed.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes.
no.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
not
because
of
what
it
communicates
in
terms
of
views,
but
because
it
uses
the
flag,
just
as
though
one
were
to
use
the
walls
of
this
building
for
writhing
a
peace
symbol
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
right.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
he
was
not
prosecuted
for
his
beliefs
for
his
verbal
utterances.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
no,
no.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes,
we
do
stand
by
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
that
respect
that
under
the
circumstances
of
this
display,
there
was
a
risk
that
a
breach
of
the
peace
or
disorder
could
occur.
there
was
no
specific
finding
to
that
effect,
quite
frankly
as
appellant
says
in
the
trial
court
or
in
the
appellate
courts
because
the
law
as
written
does
not
require
a
tendency
to
breach
the
peace
as
an
element.
but
historically,
that
has
been
one
of
the
motivating
factors
behind
the
enactment
of
these
laws
and
in
terms
of
applying
this
law
and
defending
it
in
a
federal
court,
if
that
interest
can
be
presented
on
the
record
before
the
court,
then
the
first
amendment
issue
recedes.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
no.
i
would
--
it
may
be
that
if
this
had
happened
somewhere
else
even
in
new
york
state,
i'm
told
that
by
colleagues
of
mine
from
upstate,
they
can't
understand
why
there
wasn't
such
an
outbreak.
subsequent
events
in
new
york
city
involving
displays
of
the
flag
bear
out
the
provocative
tendency
of
certain
acts
towards
the
flag
and
displays
of
the
flag.
i
don't
know
whether
appellant
should
prevail
because
the
--
because
new
yorkers
at
least
in
this
instance
perhaps
are
more
jaded
than
the
average
citizen
in
the
united
states.
there
is
a
recent
law
review
article
which
has
a
history
of
flag
desecration
and
shows
constantly
over
the
years
the
provocative
quality
of
certain
displays
which
i
think
is
inherent
in
the
legislative
purpose.
that
is
in
volume
3
of
the
indiana
legal
forum.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
--
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
was
no
seizure
of
the
flag
constructions
and
the
proof
of
guilt
was
established
primarily
by
photographs
taken
at
the
gallery.
these
photographs
are
included
in
the
original
record
and
mr.
seaver
is
been
kind
enough
to
obtain
them
here
in
the
court.
i
think
it
might
be
convenient
if
these
are
passed
up
to
the
court
because
i'd
like
to
refer
to
them,
some
of
them
during
my
oral
argument.
the
immediate
question
presented
by
this
case
is
the
extent
to
which
the
people
while
preserving
the
liberties
that
the
flag
stands
for
may
also
take
steps
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
the
flag
as
a
national
symbol
of
general
use.
whatever
place
this
case
finds
in
constitutional
history,
will
probably
be
attributable
however
to
a
broader
question
and
that
is
the
difficult
balancing
between
pure
speech
and
symbolic
conduct
that
has
attracted
the
attention
of
this
court
in
several
cases
in
recent
years.
because
the
statute
here
in
question
involves
casting
contempt
by
act
and
the
trial
court
specifically
found
that
the
appellant's
constructions
or
the
display
of
these
constructions
cast
contempt
by
act.
every
state
has
a
statute
in
some
way
of
prescribing
the
acts
which
maybe
addressed
to
the
flag.
congress
recently
has
enacted
a
statute
which
in
many
ways
is
similar
to
the
new
york
law.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
i
would
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
the
defendant
was
charged
with
mutilation
--
with
the
general
language
of
the
subdivision
(d)
of
the
penal
law.
the
court
found
only
that
he
cast
contempt
by
act.
there
was
no
evidence
and
indeed
it
was
not
the
people's
theory
that
appellant
himself
mutilated
the
flag.
the
evidence
was
that
it
was
another
person,
the
artist
who
had
used
the
flag.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
the
act
was
the
display
of
a
physically
altered
actual
flag,
and
the
permission
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes
and
the
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
the
causing
of
this
display
and
the
permitting
this
display
to
continue
including
the
day
on
which
the
summons
was
issued.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
an
act
as
opposed
to
words.
appellant
was
not
prosecuted
for
anything
that
he
said
or
indeed
for
any
belief
that
he
may
have
had.
we
do
not
know
in
this
record
what
appellant's
beliefs
are,
although
he
did
testify
as
to
his
opinion
as
to
the
artist's
intention.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
that
would
be
an
easier
case
i
think
to
defend,
and
there
is
a
case
like
that
on
its
way
to
this
court
from
new
york
where
a
person
in
public
burned
the
flag.
the
way
we
analyze
this
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes,
but
the
way
we
analyze
this
problem
of
its
freedom
of
expression,
there's
a
continuum
between
conduct,
pure
conduct
and
pure
speech
words.
if
the
state
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
there
would
be
no
statute
as
--
that
i
know
of
that
would
prevent
that
other
some
law
dealing
with
fire
regulations.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
no,
this
law
deals
only
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
not
unless
this
act
occurred
in
public
--
there
was
some
public
act.
now
in
this
case
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
i
doubt
--
i
don't
know.
i
have
to
--
would
have
to
know
the
facts
as
to
whether
this
was
deem
to
cast
contempt
on
the
flag.
in
this
particular
case,
there's
no
dispute
that
there
was
a
public
event.
indeed,
as
one
of
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes,
this
has
to
be
public.
this
cannot
be
--
the
statute
does
not
apply
to
acts
in
private.
a
person
under
this
law
and
congress'
law
could
burn
the
flag
in
his
own
home
or
to
private
party.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
i
think
that
historically,
the
impetus
was
the
misuse
of
the
flag
in
some
political
campaigns
and
commercial
advertising
after
the
civil
war.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes,
the
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
historically,
i
don't
know
what
the
reason
is.
it
may
have
been
that
congress
felt
that
the
states
were
better
equipped
through
local
law
enforcement
to
deal
with
this.
in
halter
against
nebraska
in
1907,
this
court
said
that
the
state
does
have
an
interest,
because
the
states
derive
their
existence
from
the
union
and
the
flag
represents
that
union.
four
members
of
this
court
in
dissent
in
the
street
case
appear
to
have
accepted
the
state
interest
in
this
area
and
the
recent
congressional
law
specifically
leaves
to
the
states
the
power
to
make
these
regulations.
the
ability
of
a
state
or
federal
government
to
regulate
conduct
that
has
expressive
elements
was
recognized
in
the
o'brien
case,
the
draft
card
burning
case,
and
there
are
two
main
tests
set
forth
in
that
case
which
we
contend
were
fulfilled
here
to
justify
the
state
regulation.
the
first
is
that
there
be
a
sufficient
governmental
interest
in
regulating
the
conduct
element.
and
if
this
interest
exists,
an
incidental
affect
on
some
expressive
element
maybe
tolerated
under
the
first
amendment.
and
the
second
principle
requirement
is
that
the
regulation
not
be
directed
to
suppression
of
expression.
as
we
proceed
to
argue,
both
of
these
tests
were
satisfied
by
the
new
york
law.
one
governmental
interest
which
is
served
by
the
new
york
law,
the
federal
law
and
the
laws
in
all
of
the
other
states
is
the
preservation
of
the
integrity
of
the
flag
as
a
viable
national
symbol
for
general
use
by
all
of
the
public.
as
was
said
in
dissent
in
the
street
case,
the
flag
is
a
special
kind
of
personalty.
it
is
dedicated
to
a
certain
use
by
public
action
and
as
such,
it
is
off
limits
for
certain
physical
acts
of
destruction
or
contemptuous
desecration
in
public,
just
as
the
walls
of
a
federal
building
are
off
limits
for
the
inscription
of
political
or
social
commentary.
appellant
would
dismiss
this
vital
area
of
human
experience,
the
symbolic
area,
the
symbolic
interest
and
yet,
his
case
is
based
on
his
assertion
of
his
own
right
to
assert
symbolic
values
as
an
exhibitor
of
art.
there
seems
to
be
no
basis
presented
by
appellant
on
which
this
court
can
say.
and
indeed,
this
court
has
never
suggested
that
there
is
no
valid
public
interest
in
preserving
this
general
symbolic
use
of
the
flag
as
a
national
symbol.
the
more
difficult
question
here
is
whether
the
new
york
law
is
unrelated
to
the
suppression
of
free
expression.
i'm
talking
now
of
the
specific
provision
that
is
at
issue
here,
the
provision
preventing
casting
contempt
on
the
flag
by
an
act,
because
contempt
is
in
a
sense
expression
and
that
expression
is
specifically
the
corpus
of
the
crime
that
is
defined
by
this
statute,
but
this
contempt
is
not
a
view
on
an
issue.
the
flag
is
neutral
on
political
and
social
questions,
and
the
statutes
aimed
at
protecting
the
flag
by
the
same
token
are
also
neutral
in
terms
of
expressing
views
of
the
type
that
are
recognized
as
having
value
in
the
free
marketplace
of
ideas.
the
flag
has
its
place
at
the
head
of
a
parade
of
hard
hats
and
it
has
its
place
at
the
head
of
a
procession
of
peace
marchers,
so
that
the
legislation
dealing
with
the
flag
takes
no
position
on
political
questions.
the
law
does
not
say
that
you
may
not
cast
contempt
on
the
government.
unlike
the
congressional
enactment
at
issue
in
the
shack
case,
it
does
not
say
that
you
may
not
discredit
the
armed
forces.
the
armed
forces
are
not
--
discrediting
the
armed
forces
is
not
a
neutral
position.
it
is
a
very
vital
part
of
political
controversy.
the
fag
is
unique.
it
is
a
kind
of
personalty
that
extends
beyond
the
ownership
of
the
particular
actor,
and
it
is
a
neutral
personalty.
as
the
statute
was
applied
in
this
particular
case,
there
is
another
interest
which
is
certainly
as
important
as
the
interest
in
permitting
free-floating
abstract
contempt
by
acts
toward
the
flag.
and
that
is
the
interest
in
freedom
of
choice
of
the
citizens
as
to
whether
they
shall
have
in
their
community
publicly
displayed
uses
of
the
flag
that
are
offensive
to
a
large
part
of
the
community.
your
honors
will
not
that
in
people's
exhibit
1,
a
black
and
white
photograph
taken
from
the
street
facing
the
appellant's
gallery,
one
of
these
constructions
hanging
the
flag
in
effigy
by
the
neck
like
a
corpse
was
exhibited
for
three
weeks
in
a
prominent
position
facing
a
major
new
york
city
thorough
fair,
madison
avenue.
it
is
absurd
to
suggest
that
there
is
no
evidence
that
this
was
visible
to
many
persons
passing
on
madison
avenue.
and
the
question
here
is
whether
the
ability
to
rent
space
in
a
prominent
display
position,
gives
the
right
to
put
in
there
any
visual
materials
for
any
amount
of
time
regardless
of
other
means
of
presenting
the
same
expression
in
manners
which
are
less
of
an
assault
on
the
citizens.
the
very
basic
right
to
be
free
from
sights
and
tangible
matter
that
we
do
not
want
was
the
language
used
recently
by
this
court
in
rowan
against
post
office;
that
involved
privacy
in
the
home,
but
there
is
privacy,
some
interest
in
privacy
and
freedom
of
choice
in
the
public
streets.
if
this
law
is
applied
in
such
a
context,
there
is
no
substantial
question
of
the
subject's
rights
under
the
first
amendment.
the
sidewalk
speaker
is
not
comparable
to
the
renter
of
space,
because
the
sidewalk
speaker
has
really
little
alternative
to
present
his
discourse
to
the
public,
and
he
is
not
there
generally
for
three
weeks.
presumably,
if
the
speaker
uses
electronic
equipment
which
broadcast
his
utterances
loudly
and
raucously
in
the
street
and
in
the
--
into
the
homes
in
the
neighborhood,
there
would
be
a
right
to
regulate
that,
so
long
as
the
regulation
is
not
directed
to
the
ideas
or
the
content
in
that
sense
of
his
utterances.
and
we
ask
the
court
not
to
say,
not
to
create
by
a
decision
here
another
example
of
a
captive
audience.
there
are
alternatives
for
expressing
the
views
which
appellant
ascribed
to
the
artist
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
it
would
be
much
harder
to
defend
such
a
prosecution.
the
statute
as
written
would
apply,
i
would
say,
and
it
has
been
so
held
in
this
case.
if
the
voluntary
audience
is
still
a
public
audience
in
terms
of
the
interest
that
i've
discussed
in
preserving
the
validity
of
the
flag
as
a
symbol,
there
is
more
to
say
for
that
interest
if
the
flag
is
in
a
sense
misused
in
the
public
street
than
it
is
in
a
private/public
gallery.
but
that
is
the
facts
that
are
--
those
are
the
facts
presented
by
this
record,
and
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
made
clear
that
this
display
in
the
window
was
a
separable
and
sufficient
ground
for
finding
a
violation
of
this
statute,
even
though
they
also
said
that
the
other
constructions
particularly
the
one
using
the
actual
flag
as
a
penis
inside
the
gallery
also
violated
the
statute
and
cast
contempt
by
act.
contrary
to
the
appellant's
argument,
there
was
evidence
from
appellant
himself
that
that
construction
used
part
of
the
american
flag,
the
actual
american
flag
and
there
is
other
testimony
that
this
was
not
a
homemade
flag.
this
was
an
actual
three-dimensional
american
flag.
the
photographs
themselves
show
that
beyond
any
question.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
i'm
--
by
homemade,
i
mean
something
that
is
not
of
cloth
banner
but
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
no,
no
difference,
but
what
we
have
in
this
particular
case
is
an
actual
american
flag.
the
relevancy
of
that
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes,
that
would
violate
the
statute
as
it
did
in
the
street
case
--
as
it
could
have
done
in
the
street
case.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes.
i
suppose
one
has
to
say
that
if
this
is
reasonably
considered
to
be
a
contemporary
american
flag,
the
present
symbol
of
government
in
essence
as
a
question
of
fact,
then
the
statute
could
apply
and
if
it
does
apply
that
it
so
held
to
apply
by
the
state
court
as
a
question
of
fact,
there
is
no
first
amendment
question.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
the
statute
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
--
as
written,
it
covers
that,
but
in
essence,
that
part
of
a
statute
has
been
written
off
as
a
result
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
street
case.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
and
the
court
of
appeals
so
held
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes.
because
of
this
now
settled
distinction
drawn
by
this
court
between
symbolic
conduct
that
has
conduct
elements
and
pure
speech
on
the
one
hand.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
it's
probably
the
--
it
might
well
be
the
same
interest,
but
in
the
one
sense
dealing
with
words,
that
interest
has
been
deemed
to
be
subordinate
to
the
first
amendment.
that
hasn't
been
the
case
as
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes,
that
is
the
second
major
public
interest,
if
that's
what
your
honor
is
referring
to,
the
interest
in
preserving
order
and
preventing
a
breach
of
the
peace.
in
the
street
case
that
was
argued
in
defense
of
the
statute
and
the
majority
of
this
court
felt
that
on
that
record,
there
was
insufficient
evidence
to
justify
that
interest
dealing
with
words
when
one
comes
to
words.
and
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
as
we
here,
are
bound
by
the
majority
opinions
in
the
street
case.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes.
our
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
the
two
interests
are
the
interest
in
preserving
this
national
symbol
when
the
display
involves
particularly
the
actual
flag.
and
secondly,
the
interest
referred
to
by
the
court
of
appeals,
and
that
is
the
interest
in
preserving
order
preventing
disturbance
through
in
effect
fighting
acts
as
opposed
to
fighting
words.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
in
terms
of
the
fighting
act,
fighting
word?
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
well,
the
court
has
--
perhaps
you're
right
that
the
court
has
taken
a
tougher
position.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
in
the
street
case
for
example
when
the
majority
of
this
court
felt
that
the
conviction
of
street
may
have
rested
on
his
utterances.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
burning.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
no.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes.
i
presume
if
the
manufacturing
of
these
constructions
had
gone
on
in
the
window
of
the
gallery,
there
would
be
a
more
direct
observable
application
of
this
concept
of
conduct,
but
a
display
is
conduct
in
a
sense.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes,
a
display
can
be
conduct
if
the
statute
that
deals
with
display
is
addressed
to
the
non-speech
elements
of
that
conduct.
now
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
the
use
of
the
actual
flag,
a
physical
object.
there
was
a
case
that
came
to
this
court
in
which
no
substantial
federal
question
was
found,
and
the
appeal
was
dismissed.
in
this
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
in
this
--
well,
that's
one.
i'm
talking
of
the
stover
case
that
also
arose
in
new
york,
where
to
protest
taxes
in
a
town,
the
defendant
flew
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
some
dirty
laundry.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
now,
the
chief
judge
full,
then
judge
full
writing
for
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
there
was
a
conduct
element
even
though
this
was
merely
a
display
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes,
indeed
there
was.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
by
the
majority,
i
would
say
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
by
the
legislature
itself
made
a
finding
that
a
public
display
of
a
physical
flag
that
cast
contempt
on
the
flag
is
a
nuisance
in
that
sense.
it
is
an
act.
it
has
a
conduct
element
unrelated
to
the
political
or
social
views
expressed.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
that
made
--
that
can
be
regulated.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
well,
we
have
--
the
statute
has
been
applied
in
this
case
to
a
display.
that
has
--
that
becomes
the
law
of
this
case.
and
i
think
the
question
now
is
not
what
the
statute
means
in
terms
state
law,
but
whether
the
first
amendment
permits
such
an
application
of
the
statute.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
no.
i
know
of
know
such
case.
but
we
say
this
is
a
case
where
the
conduct
can
be
proscribed.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes.
no.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
not
because
of
what
it
communicates
in
terms
of
views,
but
because
it
uses
the
flag,
just
as
though
one
were
to
use
the
walls
of
this
building
for
writhing
a
peace
symbol
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
right.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
he
was
not
prosecuted
for
his
beliefs
for
his
verbal
utterances.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
no,
no.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes,
we
do
stand
by
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
that
respect
that
under
the
circumstances
of
this
display,
there
was
a
risk
that
a
breach
of
the
peace
or
disorder
could
occur.
there
was
no
specific
finding
to
that
effect,
quite
frankly
as
appellant
says
in
the
trial
court
or
in
the
appellate
courts
because
the
law
as
written
does
not
require
a
tendency
to
breach
the
peace
as
an
element.
but
historically,
that
has
been
one
of
the
motivating
factors
behind
the
enactment
of
these
laws
and
in
terms
of
applying
this
law
and
defending
it
in
a
federal
court,
if
that
interest
can
be
presented
on
the
record
before
the
court,
then
the
first
amendment
issue
recedes.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
no.
i
would
--
it
may
be
that
if
this
had
happened
somewhere
else
even
in
new
york
state,
i'm
told
that
by
colleagues
of
mine
from
upstate,
they
can't
understand
why
there
wasn't
such
an
outbreak.
subsequent
events
in
new
york
city
involving
displays
of
the
flag
bear
out
the
provocative
tendency
of
certain
acts
towards
the
flag
and
displays
of
the
flag.
i
don't
know
whether
appellant
should
prevail
because
the
--
because
new
yorkers
at
least
in
this
instance
perhaps
are
more
jaded
than
the
average
citizen
in
the
united
states.
there
is
a
recent
law
review
article
which
has
a
history
of
flag
desecration
and
shows
constantly
over
the
years
the
provocative
quality
of
certain
displays
which
i
think
is
inherent
in
the
legislative
purpose.
that
is
in
volume
3
of
the
indiana
legal
forum.
