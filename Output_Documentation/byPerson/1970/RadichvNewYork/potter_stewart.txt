justice
potter
stewart
is
there
a
representation
of
that
in
the
appendix
anywhere?
justice
potter
stewart
only
the
original,
so
it
hasn't
been
reproduced?
justice
potter
stewart
we
have
some
many
reproductions
of
it
i
think
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
originals
have
been
lodged
with
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
and
these
were
all
for
sale,
were
they?
justice
potter
stewart
was
the
artist
a
witness?
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
defendant's
act?
justice
potter
stewart
having
them
in
his
gallery,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
displaying
them
to
the
public?
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
that's
an
act?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
juviler,
am
i
wrong
in
my
understanding
that
the
cases
on
which
you
rely
distinguishing
verbal
communication
from
communication
by
act,
all
involve,
all
involve
cases
where
the
act
itself,
the
conduct,
could
be
made,
could
constitutionally
be
made
illegal
for
some
other
reason?
that
is
let's
assume
a
fellow
sets
fire
to
the
white
house
to
express
his
views.
obviously,
setting
fire
to
the
white
house
for
various
reasons
can
be
made
criminal,
and
that's
--
even
though
he
may
say
that’s
symbolic
speech.
let's
say
he
blows
off
the
nose
of
the
statue
of
liberty,
that's
destruction
of
public
property
and
that
can
be
made
--
that's
for
various
state
interests
or
let's
say
the
o'brien
case
because
of
the
interest
of
the
selective
service
system.
the
--
it
could
be
made
a
criminal
offense
not
to
destroy
a
draft
card
even
against
the
defense
that
this
was
symbolic
speech.
all
of
those
cases
involved
conduct
which
otherwise
could
be
made
illegal.
i
don't
understand
that
this
case
involves
any
conduct
whatsoever
that
could
be
made
illegal.
the
conduct
as
i
understand
it,
is
exhibiting
something.
that's
the
only
act
you
talking
about,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
what
interest
does
the
state
have
to
prevent
the
exhibition
of
something
as
contrasted
to
prevent
the
verbal
expression
of
something
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
is
the
difference?
i
mean
in
other
words,
i
should
think
if
those
are
valid,
they
would
be
equally
valid
against
verbal
expression
casting
contempt
upon
the
flag,
would
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
in
terms
of
either
one
of
those
purported
justifications?
justice
potter
stewart
what
get
--
just
give
me
a
case
where
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
on
his
expression.
justice
potter
stewart
rather
than
his
mutilation
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
mutilation
or
defacement
or
destruction
of
a
flag.
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
this
case,
there
is
no
conviction
for
mutilating,
defacing
or
destroying
a
flag?
justice
potter
stewart
but
merely
for
casting
contempt
upon
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
only
act
as
i
understand
your
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
is
the
non-speech
element
here?
justice
potter
stewart
caldwell
or
cabell
--
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
hung
up
the
dirty
laundry.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
common
law
nuisance,
but
that,
there
was
no
such
finding
here,
was
there?
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
will
be
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
words
of
the
statute
in
issue
here
as
i
understand
it
are
those
words
that
make
it
an
offense
to
anyone
--
for
anyone
who
shall
publicly
cast
contempt
on
a
flag
by
act,
considering
not
displaying,
nothing
about
a
nuisance.
justice
potter
stewart
my
only
--
i
just
wondered
if
you
had
any
case
where
--
in
which
a
distinction
was
made
between
verbal
communication
and
communication
by
conduct,
where
the
conduct
was
not
conduct
of
a
kind,
it
could
be
proscribed?
justice
potter
stewart
simply
because
of
what
it
communicates.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
potter
stewart
this
defendant,
this
man
is
been
convicted
simply
exhibited
this
--
the
sculpture,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
his
conduct?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
only
act
to
use
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
statutory
word
that
you
rely
on?
justice
potter
stewart
his
exhibition
of
the
sculpture,
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
nor
for
defacing
a
flag
nor
for
mutilating
a
flag?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
a
representation
of
that
in
the
appendix
anywhere?
justice
potter
stewart
only
the
original,
so
it
hasn't
been
reproduced?
justice
potter
stewart
we
have
some

reproductions
of

i
think
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
originals
have
been
lodged
with
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
and
these
were
all
for
sale,
were
they?
justice
potter
stewart
was
the
artist
a
witness?
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
defendant's
act?
justice
potter
stewart
having
them
in
his
gallery,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
displaying
them
to
the

justice
potter

you

all

involved

otherwise
could

i
don't
understand
that
this
case
involves
any
conduct
whatsoever
that
could
be
made
illegal.
the
conduct
as
i
understand
it,
is
exhibiting
something.
that's
the
only
act
you
talking
about,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
what
interest
does
the
state
have
to
prevent
the
exhibition
of
something
as

to
prevent

get

just

a

stewart
yes,
on
his

justice
potter
stewart
rather
than
his
mutilation
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
mutilation
or
defacement
or
destruction
of
a
flag.
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
this
case,
there
is
no
conviction

justice
