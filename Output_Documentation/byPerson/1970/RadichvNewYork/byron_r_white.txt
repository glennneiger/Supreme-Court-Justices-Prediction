justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask,
was
it
essential
or
unavoidable
for
the
trial
court
to
hold
that
while
these
charges
in
the
language
of
the
statute
namely
mutilation
or
defilement
or
the
casting
contempt
on
this,
he
came
down
only
on
casting
contempt?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
this
also
a
mutilation?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
your
answer
is
yes,
so
this
is
the
only
part
of
the
statute
this
particular
defendant
could've
been
convicted?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
your
position
perhaps
you've
already
stated
it,
on
contempt
to
by
speech,
by
words
rather
than
by
act?
the
statute
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
surely
covers
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
if
you
deliver
the
same
message
by
an
act,
namely
if
you
cast
contempt
by
an
act,
you
say
the
statute
is
valid
if
you
do
it
by
an
act
rather
than
by
words?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
what
is
the
state
--
what
more
interest
does
a
state
have
in
proscribing
the
message
delivered
by
an
act
than
the
message
delivered
by
words?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
is
that
though?
the
lower
court,
i
mean
your
state
court
certainly
stated
another
ground
for
this,
didn't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask,
was
it
essential
or
unavoidable
for
the
trial
court
