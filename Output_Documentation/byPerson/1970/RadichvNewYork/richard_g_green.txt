mr.
richard
g.
green
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
conviction
of
the
appellant
and
it's
an
appeal
by
the
appellant
from
his
conviction
in
the
new
york
courts
for
casting
contempt
on
the
flag
of
the
united
states
by
exhibiting
in
his
art
gallery
certain
sculptures.
the
issues
involve
the
first
amendment.
they
involve
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
the
terms
of
whether
the
statute
is
sufficiently
clear
and
definite.
they
involve
the
equal
protection
clause
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
of
a
situation
where
there
is
an
exemption
in
the
statute
for
the
exhibition,
or
for
the
portrayal
or
photographs
of
these
same
sculptures
in
newspapers
and
periodicals,
and
for
the
display
of
paintings
using
a
flag
motive
in
art
galleries
as
well.
the
appellant
was
the
proprietor
of
an
art
gallery
on
the
second
floor
of
a
building
on
madison
avenue
in
new
york
city.
the
gallery
was
recognized
in
the
art
world
and
specialized
in
exhibits
of
sculpture.
in
the
appellant's
gallery,
he
exhibited
certain
sculptures
or
constructions
as
they
are
called
by
an
artist
named
mark
murrell.
the
artist
murrell
is
not
a
defendant
in
this
case.
the
sculptures
were
made
of
fabric.
some
of
which
were
of
what
appeared
to
be
the
american
flag
or
may
have
been
actual
flags,
the
record
is
not
clear.
one
of
the
sculptures
what
appeared
to
be
a
flag
in
the
shape
of
a
human
body
hanging
from
a
yellow
noose
was
in
the
second
floor
window
of
the
gallery.
it
was
visible
from
within
the
gallery,
and
also
to
passersby
on
madison
avenue
who
happen
to
look
up
to
the
--
up
from
the
street
to
the
second
floor.
mr.
richard
g.
green
it's
not
in
the
appendix.
it
is
in
the
exhibits
which
have
been
submitted
to
the
court,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
g.
green
no,
it
has
not
sir.
mr.
richard
g.
green
i'm
sorry.
i
have
another
set
of
copies
of
them,
but
they
are
not
exactly
as
the
district
attorney's
--
mr.
richard
g.
green
that's
right
sir.
mr.
richard
g.
green
the
--
one
of
the
sculptures
as
i've
mentioned
could've
been
seen
from
the
street,
this
was
the
noose
figure,
the
figure
in
what
appeared
to
be
human
body
hanging
from
a
noose
if
anyone
looked
up
to
the
second
floor
window.
the
other
sculptures
were
visible
only
in
the
art
gallery.
the
art
gallery
was
open
to
the
public.
seven
of
the
sculptures
are
the
subject
of
this
prosecution.
there
were
13
--
there
are
more
seven
exhibits
because
there's
a
duplication
of
some
of
the
sculptures
in
certain
of
photographs.
there
were
13
works
by
murrell
in
the
exhibit
including
three
paintings.
one
of
the
noose
figure,
the
same
figure
which
was
in
the
window
and
two
others
using
the
flag
motive.
none
of
the
paintings
was
mentioned
in
the
complaint.
now
the
appellant
here
was
not
found
guilty
of
defacing
or
mutilating
the
flag.
he
was
convicted
only
and
directly
of
casting
contempt
on
the
flag
by
exhibiting
seven
of
murrell's
sculptures.
the
exhibition
had
been
going
on
in
the
art
gallery
for
two
weeks
when
the
summons
were
served.
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
disorder
inside
or
outside
the
gallery
or
of
any
circumstances
that
might
lead
to
disorder,
nor
of
any
complaints
of
disorder.
only
the
defendant
and
one
other
person
were
in
the
art
gallery
when
the
police
visited.
mr.
richard
g.
green
he
got
a
sentence
of
$500.00
or
60
days
in
jail.
the
courts
below
held
that
no
showing
of
disorder
or
any
threat
of
disorder
was
necessary
for
conviction.
the
circular
announcing
the
exhibition
which
is
the
defendant's
exhibit
b
which
is
also
with
the
exhibits,
was
sent
to
the
defendant's
regular
mailing
list
of
collectors,
of
museum
people,
the
press,
universities
and
art
departments.
it
announced
simply
an
exhibition
of
constructions
by
mark
murrell
and
gave
the
dates
and
place
of
the
exhibit.
the
same
circular
was
also
available
in
the
gallery.
mr.
richard
g.
green
the
paintings,
the
sculptures
are
all
for
sale,
yes
sir.
war
protest
songs
were
played
on
a
tape
recorder
in
the
gallery
while
the
works
were
on
exhibition.
the
sale
arrangement
was
the
customary
new
york
art
gallery
arrangement
whereby
the
dealer
receives
a
commission
of
thirty-three
and
third
percent
of
the
sale
price.
the
appellant
who
had
been
in
the
art
gallery
business
for
14
years
and
has
a
degree
in
fine
arts
from
columbia,
and
hilton
kramer
who
was
the
art
news
editor
of
the
new
york
times
and
who
reviewed
the
murrell
exhibit
for
that
newspaper
testified.
they
testified
that
modern
day
artists
use
various
materials
in
their
work.
they
use
fabric,
metal,
wood,
paint,
pieces
of
junk
and
that
they
mix
them
in
the
same
work.
and
that
today,
there
is
no
longer
a
difference
between
two
dimensional
and
three
dimensional
works
between
painting,
sculpture
or
so
called
mixed
works.
they
testified
also
that
they
consider
the
murrell
constructions
to
be
works
of
art
of
the
genre
known
generally
is
"protest
art."
kramer
the
critic,
said
that
he
personally
was
more
interested
in
the
aesthetic
qualities
of
the
work
than
in
the
political
protest.
the
defendant
testified
that
he
had
no
intent
to
cast
contempt
on
the
flag.
he
testified
also
that
he
thought
the
artist,
murrell,
did
not
intend
any
contempt
for
the
flag,
but
that
actually
what
the
artist
was
dong
was
questioning
the
behavior
of
others,
who
he
thought
were
using
the
flag
for
aggressive
purposes.
mr.
richard
g.
green
no
sir,
he
was
not.
the
new
york
statute
is
subdivision
16d
of
section
1425
of
the
old
penal
law
of
new
york.
it
is
now
on
in
section
136
of
the
general
business
law.
the
statute
is
frequently
been
termed
by
the
courts
and
by
others
as
a
desecration
statute,
and
it
makes
it
a
crime
to
publicly
mutilate,
deface,
defile
or
defy
trample
upon
or
cast
contempt
by
words
or
act.
there
is
no
logic
to
the
sentence.
the
flag
is
not
mentioned,
but
presumably
that's
what's
intended.
this
court
in
the
street
case
read
the
phrase
by
words
out
of
the
statute.
now,
we
contend
first
that
appellant's
conviction
violates
the
first
amendment
guarantee
of
freedom
of
speech.
that
the
first
amendment
prohibits
punishment
for
exhibition
of
sculpture
on
the
ground
that
it
is
contemptuous
of
the
flag.
it
is
important
i
think
for
the
court
to
note
here
that
so
far
as
this
appellant
is
concerned,
the
statute
is
directed
solely
at
communication
of
an
idea
or
an
attitude,
casting
contempt.
he
was
convicted
only
of
casting
contempt
on
the
flag.
now
the
lumping
of
the
term
casting
contempt
in
the
statute
with
physical
acts
of
mutilation
and
defacement
may
perhaps
tend
to
obscure
this,
as
perhaps
also
does
the
existence
of
the
legal
concept
of
contempt
of
court
which
is
a
different
concept.
but
the
fundamental
fact
here
is
that
this
statute
is
directed
entirely
at
communication
at
casting
contempt.
that
being
so,
we
do
not
believe
it
can
stand
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
richard
g.
green
i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
think
that
in
the
case
of
contempt
of
court,
the
concept
is
a
different
one.
the
concept
is
one
having
to
do
with
the
administration
of
justice
and
it
isn't
--
it
directed
toward
the
administration
of
justice
and
the
function
of
the
court.
mr.
richard
g.
green
yes,
i
see
a
difference
your
honor.
for
example
in
the
pennekamp
case
and
in
the
bridges
case,
the
contempt
of
court
thing
is
related
directly
to
the
process
of
the
court
to
the
administration
of
justice.
in
bridges
and
in
pennekamp
for
example
where
there
were
comments
which
could
be
held
to
be
contemptuous
in
a
sense
of
communication
of
the
court.
nonetheless,
there
was
no
contempt
of
court
in
a
legal
sense
and
i
think
therefore
that
there
is
a
difference.
now,
that
being
so,
we
don't
believe
that
this
conviction
the
statute
can
stand
under
the
first
amendment.
we
intend
to
show
to
the
court
that
this
case
involves
pure
speech
under
the
first
amendment.
but
even
if
we
treat
these
sculptures
as
an
act,
as
conduct,
what
we
have
here
is
a
statute
that
prohibits
not
the
act,
but
the
communication.
now
if
we
assume
for
the
moment
that
these
sculptures
or
their
exhibition
or
conduct,
this
case
is
very
different.
it's
quite
the
opposite
of
the
ordinary
so
called
symbolic
speech
case.
in
the
usual
symbolic
speech
case,
the
statute
on
its
face
prohibits
conduct
which
the
state
has
a
right
to
prohibit
and
the
defendant
comes
in
and
argues
that
since
he
employed
that
conduct
for
communicative
purposes,
then
the
first
amendment
prohibits
the
application
of
the
statute
to
him.
that's
not
this
case.
in
this
case,
the
point
of
the
statute
under
which
appellant
has
been
convicted
prohibits
communication;
communication
of
an
idea,
contempt.
and
if
it's
applied
to
symbolic
conduct,
it
would
be
applied
to
the
communicative
aspect
of
the
conduct.
what
the
statute
prohibits
here
is
the
communicative
aspect
of
the
conduct
and
not
the
conduct
itself.
hence,
even
if
we
assume
that
this
is
not
pure
speech,
the
question
before
the
court
would
therefore
be
not
whether
conduct
prohibited
by
a
statute
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
but
whether
the
constitution
permits
a
statue
to
be
directed
entirely
at
communication,
solely
because
the
means
of
communication
could
be
an
act
subject
to
state
control.
now,
we
do
contend
however
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
speech
not
with
so
called
symbolic
speech,
or
with
conduct
akin
to
speech
and
we
contend
further
that
this
case
is
governed
by
this
court's
holding
in
street.
we
submit
that
painting
and
sculpture
are
speech
as
that
term
is
used
in
the
first
amendment
as
much
as
words.
we
submit,
we
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
earliest
form
of
writing
was
picture
writing,
cut
or
drawn
on
stone,
long
before
men
could
write
words.
photographs
and
cartoons
for
example
have
always
been
considered
writing
in
the
law
of
defamation.
it
is
our
contention
that
works
of
art,
whether
they
are
books,
motion
pictures,
cartoons,
paintings
or
sculpture
are
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
these
sculptures
we
say
are
therefore
entitled
to
the
same
protection
as
the
words
in
street.
now,
works
of
art
have
traditionally
been
used
to
express
political
protest.
in
the
instant
case,
the
courts
below
have
found
that
these
sculptures
were
political
protests.
at
the
same
time,
we
don't
discount
our
contention
of
all
works
of
art,
whether
or
not
they
communicate
a
political
message,
are
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
now,
it
should
be
noted
here
that
the
statutory
language
which
forbids
casting
contempt
on
the
flag
precludes
punishment
of
an
artist
for
using
the
flag
to
praise
united
states
policy.
on
its
face,
the
statute
permits
the
artist
to
use
the
flag
in
support
of
united
states
policy,
but
forbids
them
to
use
it
if
he
would
condemn
u.s.
policy.
whether
he
would
condemn
it
in
the
case
of
the
vietnam
war
as
overly
aggressive
or
is
insufficiently
so,
if
he
would
condemn
u.s.
policy,
he
is
forbidden
to
use
the
flag.
now
this
is
essentially
the
same
vice
which
this
court
condemned
in
shack
where
the
statute
permitted
the
use
of
the
united
states
military
uniform
in
theatrical
productions,
only
if
it
did
not
discredit
the
particular
armed
force.
this
prohibition
of
derogatory
use
clearly
violates
the
first
amendment
and
first
amendment
rights.
we
argue
also
that
the
only
governmental
interest
furthered
by
this
new
york
statute
is
compelling
respect
for
the
flag,
an
interest
which
cannot
be
furthered
without
violating
the
first
amendment.
in
street,
this
court
suggested
four
possible
interests
which
might
support
the
state's
prohibition
of
street's
contemptuous
words.
we
believe
that
we
have
demonstrated
in
our
briefs
that
none
of
these
possible
interests
can
support
this
conviction,
just
as
they
could
not
support
the
conviction
of
street.
appellee
and
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
nonetheless
have
urged
that
the
function
of
the
statute
is
one
to
assure
respect
for
our
national
emblem,
and
two,
to
prevent
breaches
of
the
peace
and
that
these
are
valid
state
interests.
as
to
assuring
respect
for
our
national
emblem,
street
and
barnett
have
made
it
clear
that
compelling
respect
for
our
flag
is
an
interest
that
has
no
place
in
a
free
society.
it
is
extremely
significant
i
think
your
honors
that
this
statute
is
commonly
referred
to
as
a
desecration
statute.
actually,
the
effect
of
the
statute
is
really
to
create
the
crime
of
secular
or
patriotic
sacrilege.
the
statue
in
effect
makes
a
religious
object,
a
secular
icon
out
of
the
flag,
but
in
our
country,
we
submit
under
our
constitution,
we
have
not
place
for
sacred
items
or
totems.
no
one
can
be
compelled
to
respect
or
pay
obeisance
to
any
symbol,
religious
or
secular.
that
is
something
that
is
reserved
for
totalitarian
states.
mr.
richard
g.
green
desecration
under
a
statute
which
is
intended
at
communication
your
honor,
we
say
cannot
be
forbidden.
mr.
richard
g.
green
i'm
saying
that
under
this
such
a
statute
as
this
which
is
directed
at
communication,
no.
i
think
that
conceivably
a
statute
sufficiently
narrowly
drawn
might
perhaps
be
able
to
achieve
this,
but
not
as
desecration.
in
other
words,
i
think
desecration
gets
into
the
same
problem
as
casting
contempt.
i
don't
mean
to
quibble
about
words.
i
think
that
conceivably
there
could
be
a
narrowly
drawn
flag
statute
that
would
be
something
that
could
be
supported.
in
that
connection
your
honor,
i
had
intended
to
mention
it
later,
last
night
it
was
brought
to
my
attention
one
additional
federal
three-judge-court
case,
a
north
carolina
case
on
the
subject
of
flag
statute
where
again
one
was
held
unconstitutional.
i'll
submit
the
name
of
that
case
to
the
clerk
afterwards.
now,
the
court
below
and
the
appellee
--
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
richard
g.
green
i'm
sorry
sir?
mr.
richard
g.
green
well
in
this
case,
our
appellant
was
convicted
only
of
casting
contempt.
he
was
not
convicted
of
mutilation.
he
was
not
convicted
of
defacing.
so
that
what
we
have
here
and
i
think
i
had
assumed
that
perhaps
this
was
one
reason
the
court
particularly
was
interested
in
this
case,
was
that
you
have
clearly
and
directly
the
communicative
aspect,
because
the
words
of
which
--
the
thing
that
he
was
convicted
of
was
casting
contempt
on
the
flag.
now,
the
court
below
and
the
appellee
also
seek
to
justify
the
statute
as
one
intended
to
prevent
breaches
of
the
peace.
however,
there's
nothing
in
the
design
of
the
statute
to
suggest
that
as
its
purpose.
subdivision
16
of
the
--
it
is
in
a
really
a
great
conglomeration
of
the
statutes
which
are
all
lumped
in
section
1425
of
the
former
penal
law.
they
have
to
do
with
things
as
varied
as
skating
on
someone's
commercial
ice
pond
or
taking
somebody's
oysters
and
i
think
in
one
case,
there's
business
of
stealing
firearms
from
a
national
guard
armory.
it
is
not
a
breach
of
the
peace
statute
anymore
than
the
statute
in
stromberg
was.
furthermore,
the
statute
is
neither
phrased
nor
has
it
been
construed
to
require
a
finding
of
a
public
disturbance
or
an
immanent
breach
of
the
peace.
in
fact,
it's
been
construed
as
not
to
require
that.
the
court
below
simply
assumes
a
possible
breach
of
the
peace.
in
effect,
what
the
court
below
has
done
has
been
to
create
by
fiat,
a
heckles
veto
even
when
as
in
this
case,
there
are
no
hecklers,
none
in
sight;
none
suggested.
now,
new
york
it
should
be
noted
does
have
a
breach
of
the
peace
statute.
now,
we
say
also
that
unlike
for
example,
the
situations
in
o'brien
and
in
aderlee,
there
is
no
governmental
interest
here
which
is
entirely
distinct
from
the
suppression
of
the
ideas
expressed.
here,
the
statute's
direct
thrust
is
at
communication.
preventing
a
breach
of
the
peace
is
used
only
as
a
justification
for
suppressing
the
communication
of
the
idea
of
contempt,
not
as
a
governmental
interest
independent
of
the
suppression
of
communication.
hence,
since
we
are
dealing
with
communication
with
first
amendment
rights,
the
states'
first
duty
is
to
protect
the
communicator
and
only
as
a
last
resort
can
it
intervene
against
him
when
it
has
demonstrated
an
actual
danger
of
a
breach
of
the
peace.
there
was
no
such
danger
here,
nor
was
there
any
attempt
to
show
one.
and
the
courts
below
have
held
that
there
is
no
need
to
show
one.
now,
appellee
suggests
for
the
first
time
in
this
court
that
the
conviction
can
also
be
sustained
on
an
assault
theory.
the
theory
of
assault
on
a
captive
audience,
but
there
was
no
captive
audience
here.
no
one
had
to
climb
the
stairs
to
appellant's
second
floor
gallery
to
see
this
exhibit.
and
as
for
the
noose
figure
in
the
second
floor
window,
if
a
passerby
happened
to
glance
up
to
the
second
floor
in
the
madison
avenue
traffic,
all
he
had
to
do
is
redirect
his
eyes
to
street
level
far
less
than
he
would
have
had
to
do
to
avoid
mr.
street,
or
to
avoid
the
sidewalk
speaker
who
is
suggested
in
the
appellee's
brief.
this
case
is
not
in
any
way
like
for
example
rowan
against
the
united
states
post
office
which
had
to
do
with
a
householder
is
right
to
stop
communications
addressed
to
him
in
his
home.
the
assault
theory
therefore
is
inappropriate
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
case
was
not
and
could
not
have
been
tried
on
that
theory.
no
evidence
of
assault
was
offered.
the
state
did
not
raise
this
contention
on
prior
appeals,
nor
did
the
courts
below
base
their
findings
on
holding
on
such
a
finding.
the
trial
court
simply
found
that
the
defendant
cast
contempt
by
exhibiting
these
seven
sculptures
of
murrell's.
we
state
also
that
the
new
york
statute
is
unclear,
uncertain
and
overbroad
on
its
face,
so
much
so
as
to
violate
this
appellant's
fourteenth
amendment
rights.
i
do
not
here
want
to
repeat
the
detailed
argument
on
this
point
which
is
in
our
briefs.
however,
i
think
the
court
need
only
look
at
the
recent
history
of
litigation
in
the
various
federal
courts
and
in
the
state
courts
involving
this
and
similar
statutes,
they're
almost
all
pretty
much
the
same
in
other
states,
to
see
how
vague
and
imprecise
the
statute
is
and
how
it
invites
uneven
application
by
local
officials.
the
one
fact
that
stands
out
clearly
from
all
these
various
cases
is
that
no
one
really
knows
what
is
legal
and
what
is
illegal
under
this
statute.
for
example,
it
defines
a
flag.
how
many
stars
and
how
many
stripes
make
a
flag
under
the
statute?
what
is
casting
contempt?
is
it
the
thumbing
one's
nose,
or
making
some
other
gesture
at
the
flag?
is
it
painting
stripes
on
an
automobile
or
flying
a
flag
at
half
mast
in
mourning
over
something
that
a
local
district
attorney
or
court
does
not
find
the
cause
for
mourning?
or
is
it
wrapping
a
flag
around
an
oil
can
as
in
one
of
the
editorial
cartoons
in
the
appendix
to
our
reply
brief?
the
trial
court
here
suggested
that
if
the
defendant
approaches
the
brink
of
what
is
proscribed,
he
must
gamble
on
an
adverse
finding
by
the
court.
well,
we
submit
your
honors
that
this
does
not
meet
the
constitutional
standards
that
first
he
must
know
what
is
proscribed
that
the
statute
must
provide
local
officials
with
adequate
standards
for
its
enforcement.
that
the
statute
must
not
include
constitutionally
protected
conduct
within
its
ambit,
and
that
there
can
be
no
strict
liability
offense
in
the
area
of
the
first
amendment.
we
claim
also
your
honors,
that
this
statute
defies
appellant
equal
protection
in
that
it
permits
newspaper
and
magazine
publishers
to
show
photos
of
the
same
sculptures,
to
print
cartoons
and
paintings
on
similar
subjects
and
it
permits
the
exhibition
of
paintings
that
use
the
flag.
the
statute
has
an
exemption
for
on
the
metal
pictures,
for
newspapers
and
periodicals.
murrell’s
paintings
were
not
included
in
this
complaint.
at
the
time
of
the
sentencing,
we
called
to
the
attention
of
the
court,
a
painting
in
the
collection
of
governor
rockefeller,
which
was
then
on
public
exhibition
in
new
york
city,
which
consists,
it’s
a
collage,
it
is
a
painting
of
the
flag
on
which
have
been
imposed
picture
of
potatoes,
the
words
iowa,
new
york,
used
fork
and
a
picture
of
governor
rockefeller.
that
painting
was
then
on
public
display
in
new
york
city,
it
was
used
as
the
circular
for
the
advertising
that
exhibit.
it
was
used
as
the
cover
of
the
new
york
times
sunday
magazine
during
that
period
of
time.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
hanging
in
the
executive
mansion
in
albany
when
we
argued
this
case
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
when
i
called
that
to
the
attention
of
the
court,
judge
full
suggested
that
they
had
enough
trouble
with
this
case
without
our
getting
into
governor
rockefeller’s
painting.
but
the
point
is
that
the
flag
is
permitted
to
be
used
in
paintings.
it
is
permitted
to
be
used
in
any
way
contemptuous
or
non-contemptuous
in
magazines,
in
newspapers.
we
have
all
of
these
various
uses
and
we
say
that
such
a
distinction
discriminates
against
sculpture.
now,
appellee
suggests
that
the
statute
permits
only
non-contemptuous
use
of
the
flag
in
paintings
and
periodicals.
but
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that
limits
the
exemption
to
non-contemptuous
use
of
the
flag.
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
second
circuit
pointed
out,
construing
another
subdivision
of
this
statute
and
holding
it
invalid,
while
the
court
would
try
to
avoid
constitutional
issues
if
it
can,
it
just
can't
go
out
of
its
way,
and
to
do
it
as
would
be
required
in
this
case.
now
in
fact
here
at
the
trial
interestingly,
appellee
conceded
that
if
the
artwork
here
had
been
painting
rather
than
sculpture,
it
would've
been
exempt
from
the
statute.
furthermore
to
our
knowledge,
the
statute
has
never
been
applied
to
paintings,
newspapers
or
periodicals
despite
the
many,
many
examples
of
such
use.
now
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
save
some
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
and
i
will
stop
to
this
point.
mr.
richard
g.
green
no
sir,
the
record
shows
only
that
the
police
officer
had
been
on
the
madison
avenue
at
8:00
or
8:30
in
the
morning
on
the
day
before
he
had
the
summons
and
he
saw
the
noose
figure
hanging
in
the
window.
and
he
apparently
got
a
summons
the
next
day,
he
--
i
believe
it
was
the
next
day.
i’m
not
sure
of
that,
he
went
to
the
art
gallery
and
served
it.
there
must
have
been
a
visit
somewhere
in
between,
because
the
--
well
no,
the
complaint
later
mentioned
various
things.
mr.
richard
g.
green
the
exhibition
was
on
for
three
weeks.
the
summons
was
served
after
it
had
been
on
a
little
bit
two
weeks
or
slightly
more
than
two
weeks.
mr.
richard
g.
green
i’m
sorry.
mr.
richard
g.
green
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
g.
green
well,
thank
you
very
much
for
that.
i
think
you're
quite
right
sir
[laughter
attempt],
thank
you.
mr.
richard
g.
green
oh,
thank
you
sir.
mr.
richard
g.
green
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
was
a
mention
in
the
argument
of
the
appellee
of
the
stover
case
in
new
york,
the
rags
on
the
clotheslines.
i
would
just
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
there,
there
was
no
question
of
a
valid
statutory
purpose
apart
from
communication.
what
we
had
was
a
statute
which
forbade
clotheslines
in
any
yard
abutting
on
a
public
street,
and
the
statute
was
upheld
under
the
general
zoning
and
police
powers
of
the
state.
here
of
course,
the
statute
is
addressed
entirely
to
communication.
on
the
subject
of
provocation,
there
was
a
question
asked
about
the
possibility
of
soldiers
throwing
stones
through
the
second
floor
window
of
this
gallery.
of
course,
there
was
no
evidence
at
all
here
of
any
disorder
or
of
any
threat
of
disorder.
however,
if
there
were,
we
would
respectfully
suggest
to
this
court
that
the
state's
first
duty
in
that
case
would
be
to
attempt
to
quell
the
disorder
that
undifferentiated
fear
of
potential
disorder,
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
can
never
justify
the
suppression
of
expression.
now,
appellee
has
concedes
that
one
can
be
disrespectful
of
the
government,
but
he
says
that
the
flag
is
something
different.
and
in
this
regard,
i
should
like
to
quote
to
the
court,
s.i.
hayakawa,
who
was
president
of
one
of
the
california
state
colleges
and
a
renowned
semanticists,
speaking
of
the
flag
very
recently,
he
sad,
and
i
am
quoting
now
"when
a
symbol
becomes
a
fetish,
then
you
make
the
semantic
error
of
confusing
the
symbol
with
what
it
is
supposed
to
symbolize."
we
submit
your
honors
that
the
issue
before
this
court
today
really
is
a
very
direct
one.
it
is
whether
our
flag
originally
designed
to
symbolize
our
heritage
of
freedom
has
now
become
a
fetish
as
mr.
hayakawa
called
it,
whose
worship
can
curb
the
very
freedom
that
it
is
supposed
to
represent.
mr.
richard
g.
green
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
conviction
of
the
appellant
and
it's
an
appeal
by
the
appellant
from
his
conviction
in
the
new
york
courts
for
casting
contempt
on
the
flag
of
the
united
states
by
exhibiting
in
his
art
gallery
certain
sculptures.
the
issues
involve
the
first
amendment.
they
involve
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
the
terms
of
whether
the
statute
is
sufficiently
clear
and
definite.
they
involve
the
equal
protection
clause
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
of
a
situation
where
there
is
an
exemption
in
the
statute
for
the
exhibition,
or
for
the
portrayal
or
photographs
of
these
same
sculptures
in
newspapers
and
periodicals,
and
for
the
display
of
paintings
using
a
flag
motive
in
art
galleries
as
well.
the
appellant
was
the
proprietor
of
an
art
gallery
on
the
second
floor
of
a
building
on
madison
avenue
in
new
york
city.
the
gallery
was
recognized
in
the
art
world
and
specialized
in
exhibits
of
sculpture.
in
the
appellant's
gallery,
he
exhibited
certain
sculptures
or
constructions
as
they
are
called
by
an
artist
named
mark
murrell.
the
artist
murrell
is
not
a
defendant
in
this
case.
the
sculptures
were
made
of
fabric.
some
of
which
were
of
what
appeared
to
be
the
american
flag
or
may
have
been
actual
flags,
the
record
is
not
clear.
one
of
the
sculptures
what
appeared
to
be
a
flag
in
the
shape
of
a
human
body
hanging
from
a
yellow
noose
was
in
the
second
floor
window
of
the
gallery.
it
was
visible
from
within
the
gallery,
and
also
to
passersby
on
madison
avenue
who
happen
to
look
up
to
the
--
up
from
the
street
to
the
second
floor.
mr.
richard
g.
green
it's
not
in
the
appendix.
it
is
in
the
exhibits
which
have
been
submitted
to
the
court,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
g.
green
no,
it
has
not
sir.
mr.
richard
g.
green
i'm
sorry.
i
have
another
set
of
copies
of
them,
but
they
are
not
exactly
as
the
district
attorney's
--
mr.
richard
g.
green
that's
right
sir.
mr.
richard
g.
green
the
--
one
of
the
sculptures
as
i've
mentioned
could've
been
seen
from
the
street,
this
was
the
noose
figure,
the
figure
in
what
appeared
to
be
human
body
hanging
from
a
noose
if
anyone
looked
up
to
the
second
floor
window.
the
other
sculptures
were
visible
only
in
the
art
gallery.
the
art
gallery
was
open
to
the
public.
seven
of
the
sculptures
are
the
subject
of
this
prosecution.
there
were
13
--
there
are
more
seven
exhibits
because
there's
a
duplication
of
some
of
the
sculptures
in
certain
of
photographs.
there
were
13
works
by
murrell
in
the
exhibit
including
three
paintings.
one
of
the
noose
figure,
the
same
figure
which
was
in
the
window
and
two
others
using
the
flag
motive.
none
of
the
paintings
was
mentioned
in
the
complaint.
now
the
appellant
here
was
not
found
guilty
of
defacing
or
mutilating
the
flag.
he
was
convicted
only
and
directly
of
casting
contempt
on
the
flag
by
exhibiting
seven
of
murrell's
sculptures.
the
exhibition
had
been
going
on
in
the
art
gallery
for
two
weeks
when
the
summons
were
served.
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
disorder
inside
or
outside
the
gallery
or
of
any
circumstances
that
might
lead
to
disorder,
nor
of
any
complaints
of
disorder.
only
the
defendant
and
one
other
person
were
in
the
art
gallery
when
the
police
visited.
mr.
richard
g.
green
he
got
a
sentence
of
$500.00
or
60
days
in
jail.
the
courts
below
held
that
no
showing
of
disorder
or
any
threat
of
disorder
was
necessary
for
conviction.
the
circular
announcing
the
exhibition
which
is
the
defendant's
exhibit
b
which
is
also
with
the
exhibits,
was
sent
to
the
defendant's
regular
mailing
list
of
collectors,
of
museum
people,
the
press,
universities
and
art
departments.
it
announced
simply
an
exhibition
of
constructions
by
mark
murrell
and
gave
the
dates
and
place
of
the
exhibit.
the
same
circular
was
also
available
in
the
gallery.
mr.
richard
g.
green
the
paintings,
the
sculptures
are
all
for
sale,
yes
sir.
war
protest
songs
were
played
on
a
tape
recorder
in
the
gallery
while
the
works
were
on
exhibition.
the
sale
arrangement
was
the
customary
new
york
art
gallery
arrangement
whereby
the
dealer
receives
a
commission
of
thirty-three
and
third
percent
of
the
sale
price.
the
appellant
who
had
been
in
the
art
gallery
business
for
14
years
and
has
a
degree
in
fine
arts
from
columbia,
and
hilton
kramer
who
was
the
art
news
editor
of
the
new
york
times
and
who
reviewed
the
murrell
exhibit
for
that
newspaper
testified.
they
testified
that
modern
day
artists
use
various
materials
in
their
work.
they
use
fabric,
metal,
wood,
paint,
pieces
of
junk
and
that
they
mix
them
in
the
same
work.
and
that
today,
there
is
no
longer
a
difference
between
two
dimensional
and
three
dimensional
works
between
painting,
sculpture
or
so
called
mixed
works.
they
testified
also
that
they
consider
the
murrell
constructions
to
be
works
of
art
of
the
genre
known
generally
is
"protest
art."
kramer
the
critic,
said
that
he
personally
was
more
interested
in
the
aesthetic
qualities
of
the
work
than
in
the
political
protest.
the
defendant
testified
that
he
had
no
intent
to
cast
contempt
on
the
flag.
he
testified
also
that
he
thought
the
artist,
murrell,
did
not
intend
any
contempt
for
the
flag,
but
that
actually
what
the
artist
was
dong
was
questioning
the
behavior
of
others,
who
he
thought
were
using
the
flag
for
aggressive
purposes.
mr.
richard
g.
green
no
sir,
he
was
not.
the
new
york
statute
is
subdivision
16d
of
section
1425
of
the
old
penal
law
of
new
york.
it
is
now
on
in
section
136
of
the
general
business
law.
the
statute
is
frequently
been
termed
by
the
courts
and
by
others
as
a
desecration
statute,
and
it
makes
it
a
crime
to
publicly
mutilate,
deface,
defile
or
defy
trample
upon
or
cast
contempt
by
words
or
act.
there
is
no
logic
to
the
sentence.
the
flag
is
not
mentioned,
but
presumably
that's
what's
intended.
this
court
in
the
street
case
read
the
phrase
by
words
out
of
the
statute.
now,
we
contend
first
that
appellant's
conviction
violates
the
first
amendment
guarantee
of
freedom
of
speech.
that
the
first
amendment
prohibits
punishment
for
exhibition
of
sculpture
on
the
ground
that
it
is
contemptuous
of
the
flag.
it
is
important
i
think
for
the
court
to
note
here
that
so
far
as
this
appellant
is
concerned,
the
statute
is
directed
solely
at
communication
of
an
idea
or
an
attitude,
casting
contempt.
he
was
convicted
only
of
casting
contempt
on
the
flag.
now
the
lumping
of
the
term
casting
contempt
in
the
statute
with
physical
acts
of
mutilation
and
defacement
may
perhaps
tend
to
obscure
this,
as
perhaps
also
does
the
existence
of
the
legal
concept
of
contempt
of
court
which
is
a
different
concept.
but
the
fundamental
fact
here
is
that
this
statute
is
directed
entirely
at
communication
at
casting
contempt.
that
being
so,
we
do
not
believe
it
can
stand
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
richard
g.
green
i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
think
that
in
the
case
of
contempt
of
court,
the
concept
is
a
different
one.
the
concept
is
one
having
to
do
with
the
administration
of
justice
and
it
isn't
--
it
directed
toward
the
administration
of
justice
and
the
function
of
the
court.
mr.
richard
g.
green
yes,
i
see
a
difference
your
honor.
for
example
in
the
pennekamp
case
and
in
the
bridges
case,
the
contempt
of
court
thing
is
related
directly
to
the
process
of
the
court
to
the
administration
of
justice.
in
bridges
and
in
pennekamp
for
example
where
there
were
comments
which
could
be
held
to
be
contemptuous
in
a
sense
of
communication
of
the
court.
nonetheless,
there
was
no
contempt
of
court
in
a
legal
sense
and
i
think
therefore
that
there
is
a
difference.
now,
that
being
so,
we
don't
believe
that
this
conviction
the
statute
can
stand
under
the
first
amendment.
we
intend
to
show
to
the
court
that
this
case
involves
pure
speech
under
the
first
amendment.
but
even
if
we
treat
these
sculptures
as
an
act,
as
conduct,
what
we
have
here
is
a
statute
that
prohibits
not
the
act,
but
the
communication.
now
if
we
assume
for
the
moment
that
these
sculptures
or
their
exhibition
or
conduct,
this
case
is
very
different.
it's
quite
the
opposite
of
the
ordinary
so
called
symbolic
speech
case.
in
the
usual
symbolic
speech
case,
the
statute
on
its
face
prohibits
conduct
which
the
state
has
a
right
to
prohibit
and
the
defendant
comes
in
and
argues
that
since
he
employed
that
conduct
for
communicative
purposes,
then
the
first
amendment
prohibits
the
application
of
the
statute
to
him.
that's
not
this
case.
in
this
case,
the
point
of
the
statute
under
which
appellant
has
been
convicted
prohibits
communication;
communication
of
an
idea,
contempt.
and
if
it's
applied
to
symbolic
conduct,
it
would
be
applied
to
the
communicative
aspect
of
the
conduct.
what
the
statute
prohibits
here
is
the
communicative
aspect
of
the
conduct
and
not
the
conduct
itself.
hence,
even
if
we
assume
that
this
is
not
pure
speech,
the
question
before
the
court
would
therefore
be
not
whether
conduct
prohibited
by
a
statute
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
but
whether
the
constitution
permits
a
statue
to
be
directed
entirely
at
communication,
solely
because
the
means
of
communication
could
be
an
act
subject
to
state
control.
now,
we
do
contend
however
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
speech
not
with
so
called
symbolic
speech,
or
with
conduct
akin
to
speech
and
we
contend
further
that
this
case
is
governed
by
this
court's
holding
in
street.
we
submit
that
painting
and
sculpture
are
speech
as
that
term
is
used
in
the
first
amendment
as
much
as
words.
we
submit,
we
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
earliest
form
of
writing
was
picture
writing,
cut
or
drawn
on
stone,
long
before
men
could
write
words.
photographs
and
cartoons
for
example
have
always
been
considered
writing
in
the
law
of
defamation.
it
is
our
contention
that
works
of
art,
whether
they
are
books,
motion
pictures,
cartoons,
paintings
or
sculpture
are
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
these
sculptures
we
say
are
therefore
entitled
to
the
same
protection
as
the
words
in
street.
now,
works
of
art
have
traditionally
been
used
to
express
political
protest.
in
the
instant
case,
the
courts
below
have
found
that
these
sculptures
were
political
protests.
at
the
same
time,
we
don't
discount
our
contention
of
all
works
of
art,
whether
or
not
they
communicate
a
political
message,
are
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
now,
it
should
be
noted
here
that
the
statutory
language
which
forbids
casting
contempt
on
the
flag
precludes
punishment
of
an
artist
for
using
the
flag
to
praise
united
states
policy.
on
its
face,
the
statute
permits
the
artist
to
use
the
flag
in
support
of
united
states
policy,
but
forbids
them
to
use
it
if
he
would
condemn
u.s.
policy.
whether
he
would
condemn
it
in
the
case
of
the
vietnam
war
as
overly
aggressive
or
is
insufficiently
so,
if
he
would
condemn
u.s.
policy,
he
is
forbidden
to
use
the
flag.
now
this
is
essentially
the
same
vice
which
this
court
condemned
in
shack
where
the
statute
permitted
the
use
of
the
united
states
military
uniform
in
theatrical
productions,
only
if
it
did
not
discredit
the
particular
armed
force.
this
prohibition
of
derogatory
use
clearly
violates
the
first
amendment
and
first
amendment
rights.
we
argue
also
that
the
only
governmental
interest
furthered
by
this
new
york
statute
is
compelling
respect
for
the
flag,
an
interest
which
cannot
be
furthered
without
violating
the
first
amendment.
in
street,
this
court
suggested
four
possible
interests
which
might
support
the
state's
prohibition
of
street's
contemptuous
words.
we
believe
that
we
have
demonstrated
in
our
briefs
that
none
of
these
possible
interests
can
support
this
conviction,
just
as
they
could
not
support
the
conviction
of
street.
appellee
and
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
nonetheless
have
urged
that
the
function
of
the
statute
is
one
to
assure
respect
for
our
national
emblem,
and
two,
to
prevent
breaches
of
the
peace
and
that
these
are
valid
state
interests.
as
to
assuring
respect
for
our
national
emblem,
street
and
barnett
have
made
it
clear
that
compelling
respect
for
our
flag
is
an
interest
that
has
no
place
in
a
free
society.
it
is
extremely
significant
i
think
your
honors
that
this
statute
is
commonly
referred
to
as
a
desecration
statute.
actually,
the
effect
of
the
statute
is
really
to
create
the
crime
of
secular
or
patriotic
sacrilege.
the
statue
in
effect
makes
a
religious
object,
a
secular
icon
out
of
the
flag,
but
in
our
country,
we
submit
under
our
constitution,
we
have
not
place
for
sacred
items
or
totems.
no
one
can
be
compelled
to
respect
or
pay
obeisance
to
any
symbol,
religious
or
secular.
that
is
something
that
is
reserved
for
totalitarian
states.
mr.
richard
g.
green
desecration
under
a
statute
which
is
intended
at
communication
your
honor,
we
say
cannot
be
forbidden.
mr.
richard
g.
green
i'm
saying
that
under
this
such
a
statute
as
this
which
is
directed
at
communication,
no.
i
think
that
conceivably
a
statute
sufficiently
narrowly
drawn
might
perhaps
be
able
to
achieve
this,
but
not
as
desecration.
in
other
words,
i
think
desecration
gets
into
the
same
problem
as
casting
contempt.
i
don't
mean
to
quibble
about
words.
i
think
that
conceivably
there
could
be
a
narrowly
drawn
flag
statute
that
would
be
something
that
could
be
supported.
in
that
connection
your
honor,
i
had
intended
to
mention
it
later,
last
night
it
was
brought
to
my
attention
one
additional
federal
three-judge-court
case,
a
north
carolina
case
on
the
subject
of
flag
statute
where
again
one
was
held
unconstitutional.
i'll
submit
the
name
of
that
case
to
the
clerk
afterwards.
now,
the
court
below
and
the
appellee
--
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
richard
g.
green
i'm
sorry
sir?
mr.
richard
g.
green
well
in
this
case,
our
appellant
was
convicted
only
of
casting
contempt.
he
was
not
convicted
of
mutilation.
he
was
not
convicted
of
defacing.
so
that
what
we
have
here
and
i
think
i
had
assumed
that
perhaps
this
was
one
reason
the
court
particularly
was
interested
in
this
case,
was
that
you
have
clearly
and
directly
the
communicative
aspect,
because
the
words
of
which
--
the
thing
that
he
was
convicted
of
was
casting
contempt
on
the
flag.
now,
the
court
below
and
the
appellee
also
seek
to
justify
the
statute
as
one
intended
to
prevent
breaches
of
the
peace.
however,
there's
nothing
in
the
design
of
the
statute
to
suggest
that
as
its
purpose.
subdivision
16
of
the
--
it
is
in
a
really
a
great
conglomeration
of
the
statutes
which
are
all
lumped
in
section
1425
of
the
former
penal
law.
they
have
to
do
with
things
as
varied
as
skating
on
someone's
commercial
ice
pond
or
taking
somebody's
oysters
and
i
think
in
one
case,
there's
business
of
stealing
firearms
from
a
national
guard
armory.
it
is
not
a
breach
of
the
peace
statute
anymore
than
the
statute
in
stromberg
was.
furthermore,
the
statute
is
neither
phrased
nor
has
it
been
construed
to
require
a
finding
of
a
public
disturbance
or
an
immanent
breach
of
the
peace.
in
fact,
it's
been
construed
as
not
to
require
that.
the
court
below
simply
assumes
a
possible
breach
of
the
peace.
in
effect,
what
the
court
below
has
done
has
been
to
create
by
fiat,
a
heckles
veto
even
when
as
in
this
case,
there
are
no
hecklers,
none
in
sight;
none
suggested.
now,
new
york
it
should
be
noted
does
have
a
breach
of
the
peace
statute.
now,
we
say
also
that
unlike
for
example,
the
situations
in
o'brien
and
in
aderlee,
there
is
no
governmental
interest
here
which
is
entirely
distinct
from
the
suppression
of
the
ideas
expressed.
here,
the
statute's
direct
thrust
is
at
communication.
preventing
a
breach
of
the
peace
is
used
only
as
a
justification
for
suppressing
the
communication
of
the
idea
of
contempt,
not
as
a
governmental
interest
independent
of
the
suppression
of
communication.
hence,
since
we
are
dealing
with
communication
with
first
amendment
rights,
the
states'
first
duty
is
to
protect
the
communicator
and
only
as
a
last
resort
can
it
intervene
against
him
when
it
has
demonstrated
an
actual
danger
of
a
breach
of
the
peace.
there
was
no
such
danger
here,
nor
was
there
any
attempt
to
show
one.
and
the
courts
below
have
held
that
there
is
no
need
to
show
one.
now,
appellee
suggests
for
the
first
time
in
this
court
that
the
conviction
can
also
be
sustained
on
an
assault
theory.
the
theory
of
assault
on
a
captive
audience,
but
there
was
no
captive
audience
here.
no
one
had
to
climb
the
stairs
to
appellant's
second
floor
gallery
to
see
this
exhibit.
and
as
for
the
noose
figure
in
the
second
floor
window,
if
a
passerby
happened
to
glance
up
to
the
second
floor
in
the
madison
avenue
traffic,
all
he
had
to
do
is
redirect
his
eyes
to
street
level
far
less
than
he
would
have
had
to
do
to
avoid
mr.
street,
or
to
avoid
the
sidewalk
speaker
who
is
suggested
in
the
appellee's
brief.
this
case
is
not
in
any
way
like
for
example
rowan
against
the
united
states
post
office
which
had
to
do
with
a
householder
is
right
to
stop
communications
addressed
to
him
in
his
home.
the
assault
theory
therefore
is
inappropriate
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
case
was
not
and
could
not
have
been
tried
on
that
theory.
no
evidence
of
assault
was
offered.
the
state
did
not
raise
this
contention
on
prior
appeals,
nor
did
the
courts
below
base
their
findings
on
holding
on
such
a
finding.
the
trial
court
simply
found
that
the
defendant
cast
contempt
by
exhibiting
these
seven
sculptures
of
murrell's.
we
state
also
that
the
new
york
statute
is
unclear,
uncertain
and
overbroad
on
its
face,
so
much
so
as
to
violate
this
appellant's
fourteenth
amendment
rights.
i
do
not
here
want
to
repeat
the
detailed
argument
on
this
point
which
is
in
our
briefs.
however,
i
think
the
court
need
only
look
at
the
recent
history
of
litigation
in
the
various
federal
courts
and
in
the
state
courts
involving
this
and
similar
statutes,
they're
almost
all
pretty
much
the
same
in
other
states,
to
see
how
vague
and
imprecise
the
statute
is
and
how
it
invites
uneven
application
by
local
officials.
the
one
fact
that
stands
out
clearly
from
all
these
various
cases
is
that
no
one
really
knows
what
is
legal
and
what
is
illegal
under
this
statute.
for
example,
it
defines
a
flag.
how
many
stars
and
how
many
stripes
make
a
flag
under
the
statute?
what
is
casting
contempt?
is
it
the
thumbing
one's
nose,
or
making
some
other
gesture
at
the
flag?
is
it
painting
stripes
on
an
automobile
or
flying
a
flag
at
half
mast
in
mourning
over
something
that
a
local
district
attorney
or
court
does
not
find
the
cause
for
mourning?
or
is
it
wrapping
a
flag
around
an
oil
can
as
in
one
of
the
editorial
cartoons
in
the
appendix
to
our
reply
brief?
the
trial
court
here
suggested
that
if
the
defendant
approaches
the
brink
of
what
is
proscribed,
he
must
gamble
on
an
adverse
finding
by
the
court.
well,
we
submit
your
honors
that
this
does
not
meet
the
constitutional
standards
that
first
he
must
know
what
is
proscribed
that
the
statute
must
provide
local
officials
with
adequate
standards
for
its
enforcement.
that
the
statute
must
not
include
constitutionally
protected
conduct
within
its
ambit,
and
that
there
can
be
no
strict
liability
offense
in
the
area
of
the
first
amendment.
we
claim
also
your
honors,
that
this
statute
defies
appellant
equal
protection
in
that
it
permits
newspaper
and
magazine
publishers
to
show
photos
of
the
same
sculptures,
to
print
cartoons
and
paintings
on
similar
subjects
and
it
permits
the
exhibition
of
paintings
that
use
the
flag.
the
statute
has
an
exemption
for
on
the
metal
pictures,
for
newspapers
and
periodicals.
murrell’s
paintings
were
not
included
in
this
complaint.
at
the
time
of
the
sentencing,
we
called
to
the
attention
of
the
court,
a
painting
in
the
collection
of
governor
rockefeller,
which
was
then
on
public
exhibition
in
new
york
city,
which
consists,
it’s
a
collage,
it
is
a
painting
of
the
flag
on
which
have
been
imposed
picture
of
potatoes,
the
words
iowa,
new
york,
used
fork
and
a
picture
of
governor
rockefeller.
that
painting
was
then
on
public
display
in
new
york
city,
it
was
used
as
the
circular
for
the
advertising
that
exhibit.
it
was
used
as
the
cover
of
the
new
york
times
sunday
magazine
during
that
period
of
time.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
hanging
in
the
executive
mansion
in
albany
when
we
argued
this
case
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
when
i
called
that
to
the
attention
of
the
court,
judge
full
suggested
that
they
had
enough
trouble
with
this
case
without
our
getting
into
governor
rockefeller’s
painting.
but
the
point
is
that
the
flag
is
permitted
to
be
used
in
paintings.
it
is
permitted
to
be
used
in
any
way
contemptuous
or
non-contemptuous
in
magazines,
in
newspapers.
we
have
all
of
these
various
uses
and
we
say
that
such
a
distinction
discriminates
against
sculpture.
now,
appellee
suggests
that
the
statute
permits
only
non-contemptuous
use
of
the
flag
in
paintings
and
periodicals.
but
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that
limits
the
exemption
to
non-contemptuous
use
of
the
flag.
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
second
circuit
pointed
out,
construing
another
subdivision
of
this
statute
and
holding
it
invalid,
while
the
court
would
try
to
avoid
constitutional
issues
if
it
can,
it
just
can't
go
out
of
its
way,
and
to
do
it
as
would
be
required
in
this
case.
now
in
fact
here
at
the
trial
interestingly,
appellee
conceded
that
if
the
artwork
here
had
been
painting
rather
than
sculpture,
it
would've
been
exempt
from
the
statute.
furthermore
to
our
knowledge,
the
statute
has
never
been
applied
to
paintings,
newspapers
or
periodicals
despite
the
many,
many
examples
of
such
use.
now
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
save
some
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
and
i
will
stop
to
this
point.
mr.
richard
g.
green
no
sir,
the
record
shows
only
that
the
police
officer
had
been
on
the
madison
avenue
at
8:00
or
8:30
in
the
morning
on
the
day
before
he
had
the
summons
and
he
saw
the
noose
figure
hanging
in
the
window.
and
he
apparently
got
a
summons
the
next
day,
he
--
i
believe
it
was
the
next
day.
i’m
not
sure
of
that,
he
went
to
the
art
gallery
and
served
it.
there
must
have
been
a
visit
somewhere
in
between,
because
the
--
well
no,
the
complaint
later
mentioned
various
things.
mr.
richard
g.
green
the
exhibition
was
on
for
three
weeks.
the
summons
was
served
after
it
had
been
on
a
little
bit
two
weeks
or
slightly
more
than
two
weeks.
mr.
richard
g.
green
i’m
sorry.
mr.
richard
g.
green
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
g.
green
well,
thank
you
very
much
for
that.
i
think
you're
quite
right
sir
[laughter
attempt],
thank
you.
mr.
richard
g.
green
oh,
thank
you
sir.
mr.
richard
g.
green
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
was
a
mention
in
the
argument
of
the
appellee
of
the
stover
case
in
new
york,
the
rags
on
the
clotheslines.
i
would
just
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
there,
there
was
no
question
of
a
valid
statutory
purpose
apart
from
communication.
what
we
had
was
a
statute
which
forbade
clotheslines
in
any
yard
abutting
on
a
public
street,
and
the
statute
was
upheld
under
the
general
zoning
and
police
powers
of
the
state.
here
of
course,
the
statute
is
addressed
entirely
to
communication.
on
the
subject
of
provocation,
there
was
a
question
asked
about
the
possibility
of
soldiers
throwing
stones
through
the
second
floor
window
of
this
gallery.
of
course,
there
was
no
evidence
at
all
here
of
any
disorder
or
of
any
threat
of
disorder.
however,
if
there
were,
we
would
respectfully
suggest
to
this
court
that
the
state's
first
duty
in
that
case
would
be
to
attempt
to
quell
the
disorder
that
undifferentiated
fear
of
potential
disorder,
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
can
never
justify
the
suppression
of
expression.
now,
appellee
has
concedes
that
one
can
be
disrespectful
of
the
government,
but
he
says
that
the
flag
is
something
different.
and
in
this
regard,
i
should
like
to
quote
to
the
court,
s.i.
hayakawa,
who
was
president
of
one
of
the
california
state
colleges
and
a
renowned
semanticists,
speaking
of
the
flag
very
recently,
he
sad,
and
i
am
quoting
now
"when
a
symbol
becomes
a
fetish,
then
you
make
the
semantic
error
of
confusing
the
symbol
with
what
it
is
supposed
to
symbolize."
we
submit
your
honors
that
the
issue
before
this
court
today
really
is
a
very
direct
one.
it
is
whether
our
flag
originally
designed
to
symbolize
our
heritage
of
freedom
has
now
become
a
fetish
as
mr.
hayakawa
called
it,
whose
worship
can
curb
the
very
freedom
that
it
is
supposed
to
represent.
