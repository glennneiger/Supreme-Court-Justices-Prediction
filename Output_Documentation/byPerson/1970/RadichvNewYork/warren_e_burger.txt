that
would
be
true
of
a
contempt
of
court
too,
would
it
not,
where
the
contempt
was
charged
was
based
on
utterances
or
other
expressions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
i
was
talking
--
to
the
act.
the
act
of
the
person
charged
is
alleged
at
least
to
be
his
utterance,
and
in
that
respect,
do
you
see
a
difference?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
do
you
suggest
that
it
follows
automatically
from
that,
that
because
respect
cannot
be
compelled,
the
desecration
may
not
be
forbidden?
chief

some
forms
of

chief

e.

well,
are
you
implying
by
that
mr.
juviler
that
if
he
didn't
have
in
the
window,
but
had
it
only
in
his
studio
for
sale,
so
that
it
would
be
observed
only
by
people
who
sought
out
the
studio,
there
would
be
no
criminal
act?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
rely
to
any
extent
or
put
it
this
way
how
much
do
you
rely
on
the
provocative
nature
of
this
act
that
might
lead
a
group
of
soldiers
home
on
leave
to
pick
up
some
stones
and
throw
it
through
the
windows
if
they
could
throw
that
far?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
the
analysis
applied
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
would
be
strengthened
somewhat
if
there
were
evidence
in
this
case
that
on
seven
particular
days,
the
traffic
was
held
up
because
a
group
of
soldiers
or
others
were
demonstrating
in
the
street
throwing
stones
at
the
window,
etcetera?
