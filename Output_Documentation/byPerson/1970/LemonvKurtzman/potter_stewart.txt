do
you
regard
the

here
as
basically
inconsistent
with
that
in
the
pennsylvania
case?
justice

stewart
in
the
pennsylvania
case,
the
one
that
was
argued
just
before

justice
potter
stewart
you’re
making
the
same
crisis
argument
that
mr.
ball
made
in
the
other
case.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
infer
from
that
because
that
these
acts
were
enacted
in
crisis,
that
they
are
therefore
constitutionally
your
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
in
your
case,
the
replacement
dollar
argument
i
take
it
is
not
available
to
the
other
side
because
this
is
a
supplement.
to
this
extent,
your
act
is
different
from
the
pennsylvania.
justice

stewart
did
i
understand
you
to
say
at
the
outside
of
your
argument,
mr.

that
the
catholic
sisters,
nuns
would
not
be
eligible
for
this?
justice

stewart
that
its
per

expenditure
for
all
purposes,
not
just
for
teacher’s
salaries?
justice
potter
stewart
for
all
the
purpose?
justice
potter
stewart
because
it
depend
upon
the
order?
justice
potter
stewart
i
was
wondering
what
these
teaching
sisters
did
with
the
$1,800.00.
justice
potter
stewart
even
on
a
a
convent?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
williams,
if
this
time
goes
by,
assuming
this
law
is
upheld
and
a
financial
pinch
gets
greater,
the
supplement
is
increased
and
finally
reaches
the
point
where
the
supplement
is
greater
than
the
basic

is
your
case
any
different?
justice

stewart
what
does
the
record
in

show
as
to
the
admission
policies
of
these

justice
potter
stewart
what
page
is
that?
justice
potter
stewart
this
has
to
do
with
situation,
when
more
than
40
apply
for
the
first
grade.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it's
in
the
form
of
suggestions,
i
guess
these
are
suggestions
from
the
archdiocese
or--?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that’s
the
–
they
use
the
metropolitan
reading
readiness
test
or
similar
test
for
pre-registration
sometime
in
march,
april
or
may?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then,
if
there
are
still
more
applicants,
then
can
be
accepted,
take
the
40
oldest

justice
potter
stewart
this
is
this
arbitrary,
but
it
has
one
advantage,
the
older

are
not
as
likely

in

the
