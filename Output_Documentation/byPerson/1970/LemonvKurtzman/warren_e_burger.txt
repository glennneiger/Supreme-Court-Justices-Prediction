we
will

in

mr.

you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief

warren
e.

a
motion
to
dismiss
for
what?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
don’t
they
receive
direct
federal
grants
under
hill-burton?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’re
on
a
hypothetical
on
your
staff,
let
me
ask
you
another,
suppose
the
board
of
public
education
state
provided
panels
of
public
school
teachers,
hired
on
public
school
standards
to
teach
all
these
non-sectarian
subjects
and
provided
by
the
act,
any
private
school
meeting
certain
other
scholastic
standards
of
law
could
have
one
of
these
teachers
to
teach
mathematics
or
chemistry
in
their
school
under
the
direction
of
the
state.
do
you
see
an
involvement
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
isn’t
our
case
anyway.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
it
is
true,
suppose
the
record
showed
conclusively
that
this
was
true,
how
does
that
fair
on
the
constitutional
question
in
your
view?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may
finish
your
points
and
will
enlarge
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
sawyer.
mr.
creamer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
you
tend
to
agree
with
mr.
sawyer’s
point
if
this
act,
the
orientation,
the
genesis
of
this
act
was
to
aid
distress
situation
in
the
private
schools
of
pennsylvania.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
ball?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
ball,
thank
you
mr.
sawyer,
mr.
attorney
general,
the
case
is
submitted.
we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
number
569
earley
against
dicenso.
mr.
cottam.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
your
state
have
statute
comparable
to
that
of
section
1001
federal
statute
on
--
presenting
a
false
certificate
to
secure
payment
from
the
state?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
be
a
an
offense
of
any
kind
to
present
a
false
certificate
under
other
statutes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
it
will
be
the
only
sanctions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
out
of
how
many?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
we’ll
suspend
now
for
lunch.
chief

warren
e.
burger
a
general
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
williams.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
all
of
these
cases
that
you
referred
to
or
at
least
in
all
the
recent
ones,
is
it
not
correct
that
the
court
has
expressed
the
views
that
this
is
matter
of
degree,
the
entanglement
or
the
involvement
or
the
potential
for
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you,
does
this
record
show
the
extent
of
the
surveillance
of
private
schools
in
rhode
island,
to
determine
whether
the
hours
in
the
curriculum
and
the
teachers
meet
the
standards
prescribed
by
the
state?
how
is
that
done?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
williams.
mr.
pfeffer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
like
mr.
pfeffer,
that
the
if
it
can
be
called
surveillance,
the
supervision
or
the
overseeing
which
every
state
exercises
over
all
of
the
schools
in
the
state
to
see
that
they
are
meeting
the
minimum
standards,
it's
always
a
factor
that
has
been
hovering
over
all
private
schools,
isn’t
that
too?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that
the
surveillance
necessary
to
check
the
compliance
of
the
parochial
school
under
the
rhode
islands
statute
is
a
greater
degree
of
involvement
in
determining
whether
the
teachers
are
properly
accredited
and
all
that
sort
of
thing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
does
a
court
do
when
it’s
called
upon
in
a
case
like
this
or
like
the
others
when
it
makes
the
judgement
that
the
school
is
--
or
the
activity
or
the
facility
sectarian
rather
than
secular?
does
it
not
make
a
comparable
decision?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
that
rhode
island
does
not
tax
but
he
ad
valorem
real
estate
tax,
the
buildings
of
the
parochial
schools,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
not
most
of
your
arguments
or
many
of
your
arguments
have
the
same
force,
with
respect
to
that
exemption?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
was
speaking
of
your
aid
argument
in
particular,
at
large
aid
isn’t
it?

thank

mr.
stanzler.
chief

warren
e.
burger
i
take
it,
you're
making
that
point,
on
the
entanglement
aspect.
well,
what
if
the
new
school
having
nothing
to
do
with
any
church,
catholic,
jewish
or
lutheran,
moves
into
a
community
to
open
up
elementary
school
for
children
and
wants
to
qualify,
is
there
any
difference
in
what
they
would
have
to
do
to
get
accreditation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
we
can
traditionally
notice
the
reality
that
some
state
boards
of
education
have
disqualified
some
private
schools,
because
of
their
failure
to
maintain
minimum
standards,
even
though
they
had
no
religious
connection
at
all,
is
that
(voice
overlap)
of
a
judicial
notice?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
doesn’t
this
mean
that
state
power
exercises
a
great
deal
of
authority
and
surveillance
over
all
education,
through
the
required
years
of
compulsory
education?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i'm
speaking
now,
the
abstract
of
a
private
school,
private
elementary
school,
and
it
develops
that
instead
of
teaching
history,
which
maybe
required,
of
course,
presumably
is,
teaching
religion,
even
though
it's
not
a
religious
connected
or
religious-related
school,
wouldn’t
the
school
authorities
say
you
must
teach
history
or
we
will
cancel
your
accredited
standing,
which
means
they
go
out
of
business.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
would
have
nothing
to
do
whether
they're
church-related
or
whether
they
were
run
by
agnostics.
