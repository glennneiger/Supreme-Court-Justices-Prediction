mr.
j.
shane
creamer
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
shane
creamer,
the
new
attorney
general
of
pennsylvania.
as
i
had
informed
the
court
by
an
earlier
letter
i
took
office
in
late
january
and
since
my
entry
into
office
is
very
recent
and
my
coming
into
this
case
is
very
late,
i
will
not
be
arguing
this
case
today.
however,
it
is
my
desire
to
emphasize
to
the
court
that
the
commonwealth
has
filed
a
brief
in
this
case
that
i
have
studied
that
brief
and
i
can
concur
fully
in
those
arguments.
i
likewise
studied
the
brief
of
the
appellee
schools
and
fully
concur
in
that
brief.
i
shall
now
turn
the
argument
in
this
case
over
to
my
associate,
the
attorney
for
the
appellee
schools,
william
b.
ball
desiring
however
merely
to
conclude
with
this
one
statement.
the
commonwealth,
as
mr.
sawyer
has
indicated
is
and
has
been
in
deep
financial
crisis.
the
public
schools
of
philadelphia,
pittsburgh,
scranton
and
the
coal
regions
are
faced
with
bankruptcy.
one
out
of
every
four
children,
close
to
600,000
presently
attend
some
1181
non-public
schools
in
pennsylvania.
in
pittsburgh,
our
non-public
school
population
is
29%
of
the
total
school
population.
in
philadelphia,
it’s
34%.
the
public
schools
of
pennsylvania
could
not
begin
to
take
on
the
burden
of
any
substantial
non–public
school
population.
it
is
not
a
question
of
it's
being
more
expensive,
it's
a
question
of
impossibility.
the
act
under
question
today
is
pennsylvania’s
solution
to
an
educational
crisis.
we
therefore
urge
this
court
not
to
upset
this
act
which
our
state
needs
so
vitally.
mr.
j.
shane
creamer
the
crisis
in
education
and
paying
for
education
your
honor,
yes.
thank
you
very
much.
