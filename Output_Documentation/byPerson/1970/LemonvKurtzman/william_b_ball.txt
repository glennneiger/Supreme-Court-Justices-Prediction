mr.
william
b.
ball
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
speaking
here
today
for
seven
catholic,
protestant
and
jewish
name
dependent
schools
who
are
the
appellees
in
this
case.
i
think
mr.
chief
justice,
i
should
begin
by
trying
to
clear
up
a
point
which
hangs
over
the
case
at
this
moment,
a
preliminary
point
which
relates
to
the
question
of
whether
the
court
below
improperly
denied
discovery
and
trial
to
the
appellants
and
it
is
our
contention
that
what
the
appellants
have
brought
to
this
court
today
your
honors
is
an
attack
limited
to
the
facial
constitutionality
of
this
act.
their
complaint
resided
that
they
attacked
the
act
both
on
its
face
and
as
applied.
let
me
come
to
the
apply
constitutionality
point
for
a
moment.
their
complaint
in
paragraph
7
says
that
they
attack,
they
sue
these
seven
schools
as
representative
of
all
sectarian
educational
institutions
in
the
commonwealth,
defendant
class
action.
we
then
brought
a
motion
under
rule
23(c)
to
test
this
application.
we
wanted
in
other
words
to
afford
due
process
for
the
seven
schools
which
have
a
great
deal
of
variation
among
themselves
for
all
the
remaining
1174
schools
in
the
commonwealth
which
are
under
contract
and
finally
even
to
the
plaintiffs
so
that
they
would
have
an
opportunity
to
come
in
and
prove
classes
and
subclasses
and
whether
one
or
more
or
any
of
these
schools
belonged
to
any
of
this
particular
classes.
now
the
plaintiffs
at
this
point
withdrew
their
class
action.
they
filed
an
answer
which
is
contained
in
the
appendix
at
a42,
plaintiff
agrees
that
the
action
will
not
be
maintained
as
a
class
action
under
rule
23(c).
this
was
followed
promptly
by
the
pre-trial
order
of
the
lower
court
which
said,
the
action
shall
not
be
maintained
as
a
class
action.
therefore,
the
issue
of
representativeness
of
these
schools
went
out
of
the
case.
this
was
the
first
wing
of
their
application
attack,
coming
to
their
second
wing.
did
they
attack
the
seven
schools,
the
application
of
the
act
as
applied
to
just
the
seven?
the
lower
court
asked
that
all
parties
submit
a
memorandum
on
the
propriety
of
convening
a
three-judge
court.
did
the
plaintiffs
want
a
three-judge
court
or
not?
they
insisted
upon
a
three-judge
court
and
in
their
memorandum,
thinking
now
of
whether
they
attack
the
application
of
this
act
to
these
seven
schools.
in
their
memorandum
on
the
propriety
of
a
three-judge
court,
a60
in
the
appendix,
they
said,
certainly
it
would
be
a
strange
misreading
of
the
complaint
to
in
any
way
construe
it
as
limited
to
a
particular
grant,
to
a
particular
school
or
class
of
schools
or
to
anything
less
than
an
attack
on
the
entire
statutory
scheme.
and
my
friend
here
on
oral
argument
nailed
this
down,
if
it
weren’t
nailed
down
sufficiently,
by
saying
a65
in
the
record,
i
am
not
saying
and
i
think
i
have
made
this
clear
that
this
act
is
only
unconstitutional
as
to
these
defendant
schools.
i
am
talking
about
it
being
unconstitutional
in
its
entire
purpose,
thrust
in
effect,
in
67
counties
of
the
state
of
pennsylvania.
i
think
therefore,
we
have
to
face
the
question
of
what
is
left
in
this
case,
plainly
an
attack
on
the
facial
constitutionality
of
the
act
and
in
that
event,
what
would
be
uncovered
by
the
discovery
and
trial
which
the
plaintiff
so
eagerly
seeks.
well,
let’s
ask,
that
tax
money
is
involved,
it's
on
the
face
of
the
act.
the
act
calls
for
the
expenditure
of
tax
funds.
the
payments
are
made
to
sectarian
institutions,
the
act
calls
for
payments
to
be
made
to
sectarian
institutions.
the
act
defines
a
non-public
school,
the
payee
in
this
act,
a
non-public
school
as
any
school
in
which
the
requirements
of
the
compulsory
attendance
law
may
be
met
or
any
school
plainly
include
sectarian
schools,
that
sectarian
schools
have
sectarian
purposes,
would
this
be
brought
out
upon
discovery
and
trial?
this
court
is
taking
judicial
notice
of
this.
this
court
stated
in
board
of
education
versus
allen
that
parochial
religious
sectarian
schools,
church
related
schools
serve
two
goals,
secular
and
sectarian.
therefore
there
would
be
nothing
to
be
discovered
upon
trial
with
respect
to
that
or
that
a
high
percentage
of
the
non-public
schools
in
pennsylvania
are
under
catholic
auspices.
indeed
the
court
must
be
deemed
to
have
known
that
in
allen,
this
indeed
is
a
fact
of
which
this
court
can
take
judicial
notice,
that
seven
schools
blend
sectarian
and
secular
instruction.
well,
if
they
do
and
they
may,
but
if
they
do,
this
is
in
violation
of
plain
terms
of
the
act
is
contained
in
section
iii,
subsection
iii
which
provides
that
in
the
teaching
rendered,
if
the
school
is
to
be
paid,
there
shall
not
be
included
any
religious
teaching
or
the
morals
of
forms
or
worship
of
any
sect
and
i
will
come
back
to
that
provision
of
the
act
in
a
moment,
your
honors
because
it's
one
that
i
would
like
to
discuss
under
a
discussion
of
the
act
itself,
in
terms
of
the
act
itself.
now,
only
this
court
can
say
whether
the
lower
court
was
right
or
wrong
and
its
estimation
of
whether
this
act
stands
up
on
the
establishment
clause.
but
if
the
lower
court
believed
that
this
act
was
constitutional
under
the
establishment
clause,
certainly
the
lower
court
was
not
merely
within
propriety
but
mandated
to
grant
our
emotion
under
rule
12
(b)
6
rather.
and
this
was
with
complete
propriety
and
with
complete
due
process
to
the
plaintiffs.
it's
perfectly
evident
this
case
has
been
down
here
for
a
long
time,
as
perfectly
evident
it
seems
to
us
that
this
case
is
ripe,
if
not
overripe
for
a
decision
by
this
court
as
to
the
facial
constitutionality
of
this
act
under
the
establishment
clause.
and
i
would
like
now
to
come
to
the
terms
of
the
act
itself
because
i
think
with
all
due
respect
to
mr.
sawyer
that
he
and
i
have
read
different
acts
109.
mr.
william
b.
ball
pardon
me
sir?
mr.
william

the

your
honor,
appendix
a18.
mr.
william
b.
ball
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes
sir
that’s
all
there
is
of
the
act,
except
for
the
cigarette
tax
amendment
your
honor,
to
which
our
brief
referred
on
page
and
footnote
2
which
simply
changed
the
basis
of
the
funding.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes
your
honor,
that’s
right,
that’s
right.
mr.
william
b.
ball
no
your
honor,
in
substitution
for
the
horse
racing
finds.
mr.
william
b.
ball
this
act
represents
one
state’s
effort
to
grapple
with
a
serious
social
problem
which
it’s
faced,
like
a
number
of
other
states
that
face
the
same
problem.
the
act
covers
all
non-public
schools,
that’s
cast
in
the
familiar
purchase
of
service
parks
which
is
well
established
in
field
of
hospital
care
and
child
care
as
a
traditional
means
of
providing
limited
and
partial
support
to
the
achieving
of
publicly
needed
functions
by
bodies
capable
of
doing
it.
it
takes
a
fixed
percent,
speaking
now
in
terms
of
limitations
in
this
act,
it
takes
a
fixed
percent
from
a
single
set
tax
source
as
the
fund,
does
not
take
any
money
from
the
general
fund
of
the
state,
it
does
not
take
any
money
from
the
public
school
fund.
section
v
of
the
act
contains
a
specific
stricture
saying
that
no
funds
raised
for
the
support
of
the
public
schools
shall
be
used
for
the
evenly
administrative
purposes
of
this
act.
mr.
william
b.
ball
it
would
in
pennsylvania,
your
honor.
it
would
in
pennsylvania.
mr.
william
b.
ball
i
do
not
think
so
that
this
is
a
question
that
could
be
answered.
however,
under
the
pennsylvania
constitution,
there's
a
specific
stricture
against
use
of
the
public
school
fund.
now,
it
takes
this
money
and
it
pays
it
by
reimbursement.
the
first
payment
under
this
act
is
not
made
by
the
state.
the
first
payment
is
made
by
the
school,
the
school
pays
for
certain
services
rendered
in
four
subjects,
four
prime,
national,
public
interest
subject,
mathematics,
modern
and
foreign
languages,
physical
science
and
physical
education.
when
the
state
has
ascertained
that
the
school
has
paid
for
such
instruction,
then
and
then
only
and
--
mr.
william
b.
ball
that
means
that
the
school
will
have
presented
to
the
state,
your
honor
a
claim
containing
three
elements
of
cost.
state

by
the
way,
these
are
not

that
the
school
submits
to

state,
there

that
the
state
must
approve,
that’s
specifically
provided
for

the
act.

which

to

or

or

that
claim
is
submitted
in
a
form
which
is
contained
in
the
regulations
and
after

mr.
william
b.
ball
audit
means
that
the
state
uses
the
procedures
it
would
use
in
the
case
of
the
public
schools
and
it
audits
the
accounts
that
relate
to
these
three
items
of
expense.
in
other
words,
to
prove
out
--
mr.
william
b.
ball
the
audit
doesn’t
relate
to
this,
your
honor.
the
audit
does
not
relate
to
any
inspection
of
the
performance
of
the
teacher
which
would
be
the
only
item
you're
talking
about
because
the
textbook
itself
and
the
instructional
material
itself
are
already
state
approved.
now
the
teacher,
as
far
as
the
teacher’s
role
goes,
there
is
no
inspection
or
monitoring
of
the
teacher’s
performance.
mr.
william
b.
ball
teachers
include
persons
who
are
employed
by
the
school
to
teach
in
the
schools.
mr.
william
b.
ball
indeed
they
may
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
ball
indeed
they
may,
yes,
indeed.
mr.
william
b.
ball
there
is
no
inspection
provided
for
in
the
act,
your
honor
other
than
audit.
the
controls,
the
secularity
--
mr.
william
b.
ball
would
i
be
concerned?
mr.
william
b.
ball
i
would
be
concerned
with
respect
to
her
performance
in
terms
of
quality.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes
i
think
i
would
be
certainly.
mr.
william
b.
ball
i
would
be
concerned
with
it
in
a
public
school
as
well
as
in
a
private
school.
in
public
schools
your
honor,
we
have
people
of
intense
religious
commitment.
we
have
teaching
in
public
schools
in
pennsylvania
ministers.
we
have
girls
in
mennonite
bonnets,
i
have
been
defending
some
mennonite
people
in
virginia
recently
and
i
can
tell
you
that
they're
as
religiously
committed
as
human
beings
can
be.
but
we
trust,
we
trust
these
people,
having
made
a
commitment
under
a
state
contract,
we
trust
these
people
to
observe
the
law.
i
think
this
is
what
your
question
goes
to.
mr.
william
b.
ball
if
the
state
found
that
this
neutrality
was
not
observed,
that
this
provision
of
the
act
which
says
that
there
may
be
no
introduction
of
religious
teaching
in
the
four
relatively
non-value
related
courses
in
question,
then
the
state,
if
i
may
finish
my
sentence
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
ball
then
the
state
would
not
be
able
to
pay.
the
state
would
not
be
able
to
make
the
payment.
mr.
william
b.
ball
well
your
honor
the
problem
i
have
with
your
question
is
that
i
do
not
know
of
any
inspection,
any
monitoring
that
takes
place
of
the
instruction.
the
safeguards
that
this
act
contains
are
like
the
safeguards
found
in
board
of
education
versus
allen
where
indeed
the
new
york
civil
liberties
union's
main
brief,
the
main
brief
in
the
case
said
that
there
can
be
no
secular
instruction
in
a
sectarian
school
and
that
if
you
put
the
textbook,
the
state
furnished
textbook
into
the
hand
of
a
sectarian
teacher
and
in
particular,
a
religiously
committed
person,
then
it
was
inescapable
that
that
person
would
per
force
introduce
whether
dishonestly
or
out
of
the
misplaced
idealism,
would
per
force
introduce
religious
values
into
that
teaching,
a
matter
which
by
the
way
is
pedagogical
nonsense.
but,
what
this
court
said
was
that
we
cannot
presume
that
public
school
administrators
and
the
people
administrating
the
new
york
act,
section
701
of
the
new
york
act
will
not
act
with
honesty.
and
indeed
we
cannot.
in
the
public
school
system
today,
there
are
many
people
who
dealt
us
would
wish
to
introduce
their
own
religious
value
concepts
in
the
teaching,
particularly
of
the
social
sciences.
and
who
might
want
to
engage
in
bible
reading,
prayer
and
other
religious
practices
which
the
law
of
this
court,
law
of
the
land
says
they
may
not
do.
we
trust
them
to
observe
this,
we
don’t
have
a
religious
monitor
placed
in
the
public
school
classroom,
neither
do
we,
neither
should
we
in
the
case
of
the
teaching
of
these
four
subjects
merely
because
they're
taught
by
non-public
school
teachers
who
indeed
may
be
that
part
of
our
community,
a
girl
from
this
neighborhood
or
from
that
who
makes
her
religious
profession
no
less
a
profession
than
many
other
people
make.
mr.
william
b.
ball
the
non-public
school
employs
the
teacher,
the
non-public
schools
in
pennsylvania
are
catholic,
they
are
protestant,
they
are
jewish,
they
are
non-sectarian,
etcetera.
mr.
william
b.

the
school
employs
the
teachers.
mr.
william
b.
ball
the
school,
in
the
case
--
mr.
william
b.

it
depends
upon
the
school
in
question,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
ball
it
depends
upon
the
school
in
question,
since
there
has
been
no
application
attack
on
this
act,
we
don’t
have,
though
there
could
be
made
an
application
attack
on
this
act,
we
do
not
have
a
particular
instance
of
a
particular
school.
for
example,
akiba
(ph)
mr.
william
b.
ball
they
may
be
and
indeed
many
schools
are.
mr.
william
b.
ball
no,
i
represent
for
example
akiba
academy.
akiba
academy
is
not
controlled
by
any
church
so
far
as
i
know,
it's
a
jewish
school.
mr.
william
b.
ball
before
speaking
of
catholic
schools,
they
are
controlled
by
the
church,
yes.
mr.
william
b.
ball
there
is
not
a
contribution,
your
honor
if
i
may
say.
mr.
william
b.
ball
well
i
do
call
it
something
different
your
honor.
the
payment
that
is
made
is
the
payment
that
is
made
to
reimburse
an
actual
cost,
after
that
cost
has
been
encountered,
has
been
encountered
in
the
performance
of
the
secular
function,
has
been
encountered
in
the
performance
of
the
secular
function
which
is
evidently
needed
to
be
performed
in
pennsylvania
and
which
does
not
depend,
by
the
way
upon
whether,
in
answer
to
mr.
sawyer’s
point,
whether
this
function
was
being
rendered
before
because
of
the
test
of
a
constitutionality
of
any
purchase
of
service,
it
is
made
depend
to
upon
whether
a
new
service
is
brought
into
being,
some
expansion
of
service,
this
wouldn’t
make
any
sense
at
all,
the
test
laid
down
by
this
court
in
allen
was
not
whether
new
services
were
being
rendered
but
indeed
whether
a
valid
secular
function
was
being
performed,
a
public
interest
matter,
a
public
interest
service
that
the
state
needs
to
have
performed.
and
in
pennsylvania
today,
this
is
badly
needed.
one
fourth
of
all
of
the
children
of
the
state
are
in
parochial
schools
and
they
have
been
for
decades.
this
enormous
burden
is
borne
by
these
schools.
and
if
we
say
that
they
cannot,
if
we
are
to
say
they
do
not
perform
secular
functions,
a
thing
we
passed
i
believe
in
allen
two
years
ago,
if
we
say
they
do
not
perform
secular
functions,
then
we
are
really
saying
that
there
is
no
reason
for
the
compulsory
attendance
laws
of
pennsylvania
and
in
fact
everything
wrong
with
using
the
compulsory
criminal
sanctions
of
the
state
to
require
children
to
go
to
those
schools,
to
require
children
to
go
to
those
schools
if
in
conscience
their
parents
say
they
prefer
to
have
them
there
rather
than
in
a
public
school.
mr.
william
b.
ball
well,
i
have
two
answers
for
that
your
honor,
first
of
all,
if
it
does,
then
also
this
happens
in
medicare
with
methodist,
catholic,
jewish
in
physical
hospitals
and
so
on.
second,
because
these
are
run
by
religious
institutions.
but
secondly
however,
i
try
to
say
a
few
moments
ago,
mr.
justice
blackmun
that
the
payer,
the
initial
payer,
under
the
pennsylvania
act,
is
the
school
itself.
it
has
to
spend
before
the
fund
is
replaced.
it's
not
as
though,
it
got
a
bounty
on
top
of
what
it
already
has.
you
see
one
of
the
things,
when
this
act
was
being
drawn,
that
i
recall
very,
very
well
was
the
auditor
general’s
insistence
and
the
attorney
general’s
insistence,
mr.
creamer’s
predecessors
insist
that
it
be
shown
that
the
amount
claimed
had
been
actually
expended.
this
is
a
quality
provision
in
the
act,
like
the
standardized
testing
and
so
on,
to
make
sure
that
the
school
plowed
into
this
act,
plowed
into
this
service,
rather,
plowed
in
to
child
education,
its
own
money
before
this
would
be
replaced.
mr.
william
b.
ball
if
it
knows
it's
going
to
be
reimbursed,
if
it's
going
to
meet
the
test
that
the
state
has
required,
it
will
have
satisfied
the
standardized
testing
requirement
and
the
audit
requirement.
yes
it
knows
just
as
a
sectarian
hospital
knows
that
it
can
count
on
this
money
coming
in.
and
indeed
it
should.
this
is
one
of
the
purposes
of
this
act,
there's
no
doubt
about
it.
there's
no
concealing
in
our
part
having
those,
your
honor,
but
the
fact
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
this
act
is
to
keep
one
quarter
of
pennsylvania’s
educational
plan
going.
we
make
no
(inaudible)
about
that.
these
schools
are
doing
a
tremendous
job
in
the
public
service
and
the
question
is
then,
are
they
in
the
educational
field?
do
they
serve
the
public
and
if
so,
can
they
be
aided
in
any
way,
can
they
be
aided
in
any
way
in
this
very
limited
form
of
supporting
the
services
they
render
seems
to
us
to
be
a
way
which
has
no
primary
effect
of
advancing
religion,
there
is
no
catholic
calculus,
there
is
no
lutheran
logarithms
or
jewish
gymnastics.
we’re
talking
about
aiding
them
to
perform
a
service
that
everybody
has
to
have.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
ball
well
your
honor,
it
was
up
to
the
plaintiffs
of
course
to
frame
their
complaint
as
they
would
bring
to
bear
the
parties
whom
they
would
and
had
they
had
equal
protection
standing,
had
they
a
single
plaintiff,
one
individual
or
anybody
who
had
equal
protection
standing,
indeed
we
would
be
prepared
to
argue
the
equal
protection
issue
here
today,
but
since
you
inquire,
your
honor,
with
respect
to
state
action
and
whether
these
schools
would
be
participating
in
state
action
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
they
receive
some
funding
from
the
state,
i
think
would
be
a
question
of
degree,
i
would
say
it's
a
question,
it
is
a
question.
i
was
thinking
of
the
case
of
powell
versus
miles,
judge
friendly’s
decision
on
the
issue
of
state
action.
and
certainly
it
is
true
that
there's
a
vast
difference
between
receiving
say
10%
of
your
income
from
the
state
and
a
larger
percent
and
what
other
things
may
be
involved
in
creating
the
state
action
situation.
in
a
proper
case,
will
we
have
to
brief
and
argue
that
point
very
thoroughly.
mr.
william
b.
ball
oh
indeed
a
black
could
get
into
one
of
these
catholic
schools
if
he
were
not
a
catholic.
we
have
schools
in
the
inner
city
of
philadelphia.
mr.
william
b.
ball
oh
heavens,
yes.
we
have
schools
in
the
inner—
mr.
william
b.
ball
a
black
agnostic
to
black
protestant
to
black
catholic,
we
have
schools,
your
honor
in
the
inner
city
of
philadelphia
which
have
been
the
tie
together
of
racially
mixed
neighborhoods
over
the
decades
and
which
are
to
a
substantial
extent
made
up
of
protestant
blacks,
who
after
graduation
become
alumni
black
protestants.
mr.
william
b.
ball
every
difference,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
ball
well,
to
begin
with
under
this
act,
the
state
cannot
pay
for
a
religious
textbook
and
under
the
constitution
they
cannot
pay
for
religious
instructional
materials
and
under
the
constitution.
and
thirdly,
this
act
prohibits
any
teacher
from
teaching
or
introducing
any
religious
matter
into
mathematics,
modern
and
foreign
language,
etcetera.
now,
if
the
state
provided
money
for
the
teaching
of
religion
to
support
a
religious
course
which
would
be
patently
unconstitutional,
yes
the
school
might
get,
certainly
the
school
might
get
the
same
income
but
the
constitutional
result
would
be,
183
is
different.
if
a
given
school,
religiously
affiliated
school,
today
were
to
claim
$800.00
for
the
teaching
of
math
during
that
year
and
under
the
act
you're
speaking
of,
the
unconstitutional
act
of
which
you
speak,
your
honor,
it
would
get
$800.00
for
the
teaching
of
religion,
no
financial
difference
but
the
constitutional
difference
would
be
totally
different.
mr.
william
b.
ball
if
the
state
were
to
pay
the
school,
$800.00
for
the
teaching
of
religion,
and
then
the
financial
result
would
be
the
same,
yes
your
honor,
the
financial
result
would
be
the
same.
but
this
of
course
would
have
been
true
of
the
financial
result
in
allen,
this
court
said
as
to
allen
that
in
effect,
the
effect
of
the
new
york
textbook
act
was
to
save
the
schools,
the
parochial
schools,
an
aggregate
sum
of
millions
of
dollars.
this
didn’t
seem
in
the
view
of
the
court
of
walz,
may
1970
to
render
the
act
of
new
york
unconstitutional.
mr.
william
b.
ball
well
this
is
what
he
said,
i
don’t
think
this
is
true
on
the
record
in
allen,
i
think
in
some
situations
they
were
and
in
some
situations
they
were
not.
i
should
like
to
conclude,
your
honor
by
a
quote.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
ball
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly,
are
there
religious
schools
in
which
those
who
control
the
school
hire
and
discharge
the
teacher?
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes,
undeniably
sir.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes
i
cannot
say
as
to
these
seven
schools
which
are
the
only
defendants
in
this
case
but
looking
to
your
question
which
perhaps
relates
to
facial
constitutionality,
yes
i
would
be
sure
that
would
be
so.
may
i
conclude
your
honor?
we
stated
in
page
13
of
our
brief
the
following,
in
our
now
heavily
welfare
oriented
society,
massive
governmental
spending
is
dominant
and
individual
men
and
women,
even
when
banded
together
in
associations
and
institutions,
no
longer
possess
the
economic
resources
with
which
to
maintain
diverse
non-state
endeavors
in
education
and
welfare.
your
honors,
education
is
certainly
the
most
precious
aspect
of
voluntarism
that
we
have,
the
most
meaningful
in
terms
of
a
free
society,
the
economic
and
financial
data
which
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
shows
the
obvious
that
taxes
and
inflation
are
simply
going
to
render
it
impossible
for
schools
such
as
those
that
we
are
describing
to
continue
to
render
service
and
to
give
individual
parents,
the
opportunity
for
a
conscientious
choice
in
education.
i
think
it's
very
clear
that
this
act
on
its
face
is
general
legislation,
it
contains
no
religious
classification
or
gerrymander,
it
is
non-preferential,
it
employs
essentially
religious
means
to
achieve
essentially
secular
ends,
without
any
primary
effect
of
advancing
religion,
inhibiting
religion
and
i
must
refer
you
there
to
our
brief
on
entanglement,
because
we
have
had
an
inadequate
opportunity
to
discuss
the
whole
question
of
entanglement.
but
we
are
up
against
the
facts
of
life
in
pennsylvania,
not
figments
of
fine
spun
doctrine
which
never
proceeded
from
the
minds
of
madison
or
jefferson,
we
are
up
against
such
facts
as
mr.
creamer
has
described.
there
is
no
reasonable
alternative
to
this
act.
pennsylvania
and
her
public
schools
are
bankrupt,
millions
of
parents
and
children
will
be
irreparably
harmed,
if
this
program
which
is
now
in
its
third
year
of
operation
and
going
into
its
fourth
year
of
operation
should
be
terminated.
i
thank
you
your
honors.
mr.
william
b.
ball
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
speaking
here
today
for
seven
catholic,
protestant
and
jewish
name
dependent
schools
who
are
the
appellees
in
this
case.
i
think
mr.
chief
justice,
i
should
begin
by
trying
to
clear
up
a
point
which
hangs
over
the
case
at
this
moment,
a
preliminary
point
which
relates
to
the
question
of
whether
the
court
below
improperly
denied
discovery
and
trial
to
the
appellants
and
it
is
our
contention
that
what
the
appellants
have
brought
to
this
court
today
your
honors
is
an
attack
limited
to
the
facial
constitutionality
of
this
act.
their
complaint
resided
that
they
attacked
the
act
both
on
its
face
and
as
applied.
let
me
come
to
the
apply
constitutionality
point
for
a
moment.
their
complaint
in
paragraph
7
says
that
they
attack,
they
sue
these
seven
schools
as
representative
of
all
sectarian
educational
institutions
in
the
commonwealth,
defendant
class
action.
we
then
brought
a
motion
under
rule
23(c)
to
test
this
application.
we
wanted
in
other
words
to
afford
due
process
for
the
seven
schools
which
have
a
great
deal
of
variation
among
themselves
for
all
the
remaining
1174
schools
in
the
commonwealth
which
are
under
contract
and
finally
even
to
the
plaintiffs
so
that
they
would
have
an
opportunity
to
come
in
and
prove
classes
and
subclasses
and
whether
one
or
more
or
any
of
these
schools
belonged
to
any
of
this
particular
classes.
now
the
plaintiffs
at
this
point
withdrew
their
class
action.
they
filed
an
answer
which
is
contained
in
the
appendix
at
a42,
plaintiff
agrees
that
the
action
will
not
be
maintained
as
a
class
action
under
rule
23(c).
this
was
followed
promptly
by
the
pre-trial
order
of
the
lower
court
which
said,
the
action
shall
not
be
maintained
as
a
class
action.
therefore,
the
issue
of
representativeness
of
these
schools
went
out
of
the
case.
this
was
the
first
wing
of
their
application
attack,
coming
to
their
second
wing.
did
they
attack
the
seven
schools,
the
application
of
the
act
as
applied
to
just
the
seven?
the
lower
court
asked
that
all
parties
submit
a
memorandum
on
the
propriety
of
convening
a
three-judge
court.
did
the
plaintiffs
want
a
three-judge
court
or
not?
they
insisted
upon
a
three-judge
court
and
in
their
memorandum,
thinking
now
of
whether
they
attack
the
application
of
this
act
to
these
seven
schools.
in
their
memorandum
on
the
propriety
of
a
three-judge
court,
a60
in
the
appendix,
they
said,
certainly
it
would
be
a
strange
misreading
of
the
complaint
to
in
any
way
construe
it
as
limited
to
a
particular
grant,
to
a
particular
school
or
class
of
schools
or
to
anything
less
than
an
attack
on
the
entire
statutory
scheme.
and
my
friend
here
on
oral
argument
nailed
this
down,
if
it
weren’t
nailed
down
sufficiently,
by
saying
a65
in
the
record,
i
am
not
saying
and
i
think
i
have
made
this
clear
that
this
act
is
only
unconstitutional
as
to
these
defendant
schools.
i
am
talking
about
it
being
unconstitutional
in
its
entire
purpose,
thrust
in
effect,
in
67
counties
of
the
state
of
pennsylvania.
i
think
therefore,
we
have
to
face
the
question
of
what
is
left
in
this
case,
plainly
an
attack
on
the
facial
constitutionality
of
the
act
and
in
that
event,
what
would
be
uncovered
by
the
discovery
and
trial
which
the
plaintiff
so
eagerly
seeks.
well,
let’s
ask,
that
tax
money
is
involved,
it's
on
the
face
of
the
act.
the
act
calls
for
the
expenditure
of
tax
funds.
the
payments
are
made
to
sectarian
institutions,
the
act
calls
for
payments
to
be
made
to
sectarian
institutions.
the
act
defines
a
non-public
school,
the
payee
in
this
act,
a
non-public
school
as
any
school
in
which
the
requirements
of
the
compulsory
attendance
law
may
be
met
or
any
school
plainly
include
sectarian
schools,
that
sectarian
schools
have
sectarian
purposes,
would
this
be
brought
out
upon
discovery
and
trial?
this
court
is
taking
judicial
notice
of
this.
this
court
stated
in
board
of
education
versus
allen
that
parochial
religious
sectarian
schools,
church
related
schools
serve
two
goals,
secular
and
sectarian.
therefore
there
would
be
nothing
to
be
discovered
upon
trial
with
respect
to
that
or
that
a
high
percentage
of
the
non-public
schools
in
pennsylvania
are
under
catholic
auspices.
indeed
the
court
must
be
deemed
to
have
known
that
in
allen,
this
indeed
is
a
fact
of
which
this
court
can
take
judicial
notice,
that
seven
schools
blend
sectarian
and
secular
instruction.
well,
if
they
do
and
they
may,
but
if
they
do,
this
is
in
violation
of
plain
terms
of
the
act
is
contained
in
section
iii,
subsection
iii
which
provides
that
in
the
teaching
rendered,
if
the
school
is
to
be
paid,
there
shall
not
be
included
any
religious
teaching
or
the
morals
of
forms
or
worship
of
any
sect
and
i
will
come
back
to
that
provision
of
the
act
in
a
moment,
your
honors
because
it's
one
that
i
would
like
to
discuss
under
a
discussion
of
the
act
itself,
in
terms
of
the
act
itself.
now,
only
this
court
can
say
whether
the
lower
court
was
right
or
wrong
and
its
estimation
of
whether
this
act
stands
up
on
the
establishment
clause.
but
if
the
lower
court
believed
that
this
act
was
constitutional
under
the
establishment
clause,
certainly
the
lower
court
was
not
merely
within
propriety
but
mandated
to
grant
our
emotion
under
rule
12
(b)
6
rather.
and
this
was
with
complete
propriety
and
with
complete
due
process
to
the
plaintiffs.
it's
perfectly
evident
this
case
has
been
down
here
for
a
long
time,
as
perfectly
evident
it
seems
to
us
that
this
case
is
ripe,
if
not
overripe
for
a
decision
by
this
court
as
to
the
facial
constitutionality
of
this
act
under
the
establishment
clause.
and
i
would
like
now
to
come
to
the
terms
of
the
act
itself
because
i
think
with
all
due
respect
to
mr.
sawyer
that
he
and
i
have
read
different
acts
109.
mr.
william
b.
ball
pardon
me
sir?
mr.
william
b.
ball
the
act
is
printed
your
honor,
appendix
a18.
mr.
william
b.
ball
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes
sir
that’s
all
there
is
of
the
act,
except
for
the
cigarette
tax
amendment
your
honor,
to
which
our
brief
referred
on
page
and
footnote
2
which
simply
changed
the
basis
of
the
funding.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes
your
honor,
that’s
right,
that’s
right.
mr.
william
b.
ball
no
your
honor,
in
substitution

mr.
william
b.

this
act
represents
one
state’s
effort
to
grapple
with
a
serious
social
problem
which
it’s
faced,
like
a
number
of
other
states
that
face
the
same
problem.
the
act
covers
all
non-public
schools,
that’s
cast
in
the
familiar
purchase
of
service
parks
which
is
well
established
in
field
of
hospital
care
and
child
care
as
a
traditional
means
of
providing
limited
and
partial
support
to
the
achieving
of
publicly
needed
functions
by
bodies
capable
of
doing
it.
it
takes
a
fixed
percent,
speaking
now
in
terms
of
limitations
in
this
act,
it
takes
a
fixed
percent
from
a
single
set
tax
source
as
the
fund,
does
not
take
any
money
from
the
general
fund
of
the
state,
it
does
not
take
any
money
from
the
public
school
fund.
section
v
of
the
act
contains
a
specific
stricture
saying
that
no
funds
raised
for
the
support
of
the
public
schools
shall
be
used
for
the
evenly
administrative
purposes
of
this
act.
mr.
william
b.
ball
it
would
in
pennsylvania,
your
honor.
it
would
in
pennsylvania.
mr.
william
b.
ball
i
do
not
think
so
that
this
is
a
question
that
could
be
answered.
however,
under
the
pennsylvania
constitution,
there's
a
specific
stricture
against
use
of
the
public
school
fund.
now,
it
takes
this
money
and
it
pays
it
by
reimbursement.
the
first
payment
under
this
act
is
not
made
by
the
state.
the
first
payment
is
made
by
the
school,
the
school
pays
for
certain
services
rendered
in
four
subjects,
four
prime,
national,
public
interest
subject,
mathematics,
modern
and
foreign
languages,
physical
science
and
physical
education.
when
the
state
has
ascertained
that
the
school
has
paid
for
such
instruction,
then
and
then
only
and
--
mr.
william
b.
ball
that
means
that
the
school
will
have
presented
to
the
state,
your
honor
a
claim
containing
three
elements
of
cost.
state
approved
textbooks,
by
the
way,
these
are
not
textbooks
that
the
school
submits
to
the
state,
there
are
textbooks
that
the
state
must
approve,
that’s
specifically
provided
for
in
the
act.
state
approved
textbooks,
state
approved
instruction
materials
in
the
four
subjects
and
finally
that
part
of
a
teacher
salary
which
is
allocable
to
the
teaching
of
math
or
modern
foreign
languages
or
physical
science
or
physical
education.
that
claim
is
submitted
in
a
form
which
is
contained
in
the
regulations
and
after
audit.
mr.
william
b.
ball
audit
means
that
the
state
uses
the
procedures
it
would
use
in
the
case
of
the
public
schools
and
it
audits
the
accounts
that
relate
to
these
three
items
of
expense.
in
other
words,
to
prove
out
--
mr.
william
b.
ball
the
audit
doesn’t
relate
to
this,
your
honor.
the
audit
does
not
relate
to
any
inspection
of
the
performance
of
the
teacher
which
would
be
the
only
item
you're
talking
about
because
the
textbook
itself
and
the
instructional
material
itself
are
already
state
approved.
now
the
teacher,
as
far
as
the
teacher’s
role
goes,
there
is
no
inspection
or
monitoring
of
the
teacher’s
performance.
mr.
william
b.
ball
teachers
include
persons
who
are
employed
by
the
school
to
teach
in
the
schools.
mr.
william
b.
ball
indeed
they
may
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
ball
indeed
they
may,
yes,
indeed.
mr.
william
b.
ball
there
is
no
inspection
provided
for
in
the
act,
your
honor
other
than
audit.
the
controls,
the
secularity
--
mr.
william
b.
ball
would
i
be
concerned?
mr.
william
b.
ball
i
would
be
concerned
with
respect
to
her
performance
in
terms
of
quality.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes
i
think
i
would
be
certainly.
mr.
william
b.
ball
i
would
be
concerned
with
it
in
a
public
school
as
well
as
in
a
private
school.
in
public
schools
your
honor,
we
have
people
of
intense
religious
commitment.
we
have
teaching
in
public
schools
in
pennsylvania
ministers.
we
have
girls
in
mennonite
bonnets,
i
have
been
defending
some
mennonite
people
in
virginia
recently
and
i
can
tell
you
that
they're
as
religiously
committed
as
human
beings
can
be.
but
we
trust,
we
trust
these
people,
having
made
a
commitment
under
a
state
contract,
we
trust
these
people
to
observe
the
law.
i
think
this
is
what
your
question
goes
to.
mr.
william
b.
ball
if
the
state
found
that
this
neutrality
was
not
observed,
that
this
provision
of
the
act
which
says
that
there
may
be
no
introduction
of
religious
teaching
in
the
four
relatively
non-value
related
courses
in
question,
then
the
state,
if
i
may
finish
my
sentence
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
ball
then
the
state
would
not
be
able
to
pay.
the
state
would
not
be
able
to
make
the
payment.
mr.
william
b.
ball
well
your
honor
the
problem
i
have
with
your
question
is
that
i
do
not
know
of
any
inspection,
any
monitoring
that
takes
place
of
the
instruction.
the
safeguards
that
this
act
contains
are
like
the
safeguards
found
in
board
of
education
versus
allen
where
indeed
the
new
york
civil
liberties
union's
main
brief,
the
main
brief
in
the
case
said
that
there
can
be
no
secular
instruction
in
a
sectarian
school
and
that
if
you
put
the
textbook,
the
state
furnished
textbook
into
the
hand
of
a
sectarian
teacher
and
in
particular,
a
religiously
committed
person,
then
it
was
inescapable
that
that
person
would
per
force
introduce
whether
dishonestly
or
out
of
the
misplaced
idealism,
would
per
force
introduce
religious
values
into
that
teaching,
a
matter
which
by
the
way
is
pedagogical
nonsense.
but,
what
this
court
said
was
that
we
cannot
presume
that
public
school
administrators
and
the
people
administrating
the
new
york
act,
section
701
of
the
new
york
act
will
not
act
with
honesty.
and
indeed
we
cannot.
in
the
public
school
system
today,
there
are
many
people
who
dealt
us
would
wish
to
introduce
their
own
religious
value
concepts
in
the
teaching,
particularly
of
the
social
sciences.
and
who
might
want
to
engage
in
bible
reading,
prayer
and
other
religious
practices
which
the
law
of
this
court,
law
of
the
land
says
they
may
not
do.
we
trust
them
to
observe
this,
we
don’t
have
a
religious
monitor
placed
in
the
public
school
classroom,
neither
do
we,
neither
should
we
in
the
case
of
the
teaching
of
these
four
subjects
merely
because
they're
taught
by
non-public
school
teachers
who
indeed
may
be
that
part
of
our
community,
a
girl
from
this
neighborhood
or
from
that
who
makes
her
religious
profession
no
less
a
profession
than
many
other
people
make.
mr.
william
b.
ball
the
non-public
school
employs
the
teacher,
the
non-public
schools
in
pennsylvania
are
catholic,
they
are
protestant,
they
are
jewish,
they
are
non-sectarian,
etcetera.
mr.
william
b.
ball
the
school
employs
the
teachers.
mr.
william
b.
ball
the
school,
in
the
case
--
mr.
william
b.
ball
it
depends
upon
the
school
in
question,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
ball
it
depends
upon
the
school
in
question,
since
there
has
been
no
application
attack
on
this
act,
we
don’t
have,
though
there
could
be
made
an
application
attack
on
this
act,
we
do
not
have
a
particular
instance
of
a
particular
school.
for
example,
akiba
(ph)
mr.
william
b.
ball
they
may
be
and
indeed
many
schools
are.
mr.
william
b.
ball
no,
i
represent
for
example
akiba
academy.
akiba
academy
is
not
controlled
by
any
church
so
far
as
i
know,
it's
a
jewish
school.
mr.
william
b.
ball
before
speaking
of
catholic
schools,
they
are
controlled
by
the
church,
yes.
mr.
william
b.
ball
there
is
not
a
contribution,
your
honor
if
i
may
say.
mr.
william
b.
ball
well
i
do
call
it
something
different
your
honor.
the
payment
that
is
made
is
the
payment
that
is
made
to
reimburse
an
actual
cost,
after
that
cost
has
been
encountered,
has
been
encountered
in
the
performance
of
the
secular
function,
has
been
encountered
in
the
performance
of
the
secular
function
which
is
evidently
needed
to
be
performed
in
pennsylvania
and
which
does
not
depend,
by
the
way
upon
whether,
in
answer
to
mr.
sawyer’s
point,
whether
this
function
was
being
rendered
before
because
of
the
test
of
a
constitutionality
of
any
purchase
of
service,
it
is
made
depend
to
upon
whether
a
new
service
is
brought
into
being,
some
expansion
of
service,
this
wouldn’t
make
any
sense
at
all,
the
test
laid
down
by
this
court
in
allen
was
not
whether
new
services
were
being
rendered
but
indeed
whether
a
valid
secular
function
was
being
performed,
a
public
interest
matter,
a
public
interest
service
that
the
state
needs
to
have
performed.
and
in
pennsylvania
today,
this
is
badly
needed.
one
fourth
of
all
of
the
children
of
the
state
are
in
parochial
schools
and
they
have
been
for
decades.
this
enormous
burden
is
borne
by
these
schools.
and
if
we
say
that
they
cannot,
if
we
are
to
say
they
do
not
perform
secular
functions,
a
thing
we
passed
i
believe
in
allen
two
years
ago,
if
we
say
they
do
not
perform
secular
functions,
then
we
are
really
saying
that
there
is
no
reason
for
the
compulsory
attendance
laws
of
pennsylvania
and
in
fact
everything
wrong
with
using
the
compulsory
criminal
sanctions
of
the
state
to
require
children
to
go
to
those
schools,
to
require
children
to
go
to
those
schools
if
in
conscience
their
parents
say
they
prefer
to
have
them
there
rather
than
in
a
public
school.
mr.
william
b.
ball
well,
i
have
two
answers
for
that
your
honor,
first
of
all,
if
it
does,
then
also
this
happens
in
medicare
with
methodist,
catholic,
jewish
in
physical
hospitals
and
so
on.
second,
because
these
are
run
by
religious
institutions.
but
secondly
however,
i
try
to
say
a
few
moments
ago,
mr.
justice
blackmun
that
the
payer,
the
initial
payer,
under
the
pennsylvania
act,
is
the
school
itself.
it
has
to
spend
before
the
fund
is
replaced.
it's
not
as
though,
it
got
a
bounty
on
top
of
what
it
already
has.
you
see
one
of
the
things,
when
this
act
was
being
drawn,
that
i
recall
very,
very
well
was
the
auditor
general’s
insistence
and
the
attorney
general’s
insistence,
mr.
creamer’s
predecessors
insist
that
it
be
shown
that
the
amount
claimed
had
been
actually
expended.
this
is
a
quality
provision
in
the
act,
like
the
standardized
testing
and
so
on,
to
make
sure
that
the
school
plowed
into
this
act,
plowed
into
this
service,
rather,
plowed
in
to
child
education,
its
own
money
before
this
would
be
replaced.
mr.
william
b.
ball
if
it
knows
it's
going
to
be
reimbursed,
if
it's
going
to
meet
the
test
that
the
state
has
required,
it
will
have
satisfied
the
standardized
testing
requirement
and
the
audit
requirement.
yes
it
knows
just
as
a
sectarian
hospital
knows
that
it
can
count
on
this
money
coming
in.
and
indeed
it
should.
this
is
one
of
the
purposes
of
this
act,
there's
no
doubt
about
it.
there's
no
concealing
in
our
part
having
those,
your
honor,
but
the
fact
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
this
act
is
to
keep
one
quarter
of
pennsylvania’s
educational
plan
going.
we
make
no
(inaudible)
about
that.
these
schools
are
doing
a
tremendous
job
in
the
public
service
and
the
question
is
then,
are
they
in
the
educational
field?
do
they
serve
the
public
and
if
so,
can
they
be
aided
in
any
way,
can
they
be
aided
in
any
way
in
this
very
limited
form
of
supporting
the
services
they
render
seems
to
us
to
be
a
way
which
has
no
primary
effect
of
advancing
religion,
there
is
no
catholic
calculus,
there
is
no
lutheran
logarithms
or
jewish
gymnastics.
we’re
talking
about
aiding
them
to
perform
a
service
that
everybody
has
to
have.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
ball
well
your
honor,
it
was
up
to
the
plaintiffs
of
course
to
frame
their
complaint
as
they
would
bring
to
bear
the
parties
whom
they
would
and
had
they
had
equal
protection
standing,
had
they
a
single
plaintiff,
one
individual
or
anybody
who
had
equal
protection
standing,
indeed
we
would
be
prepared
to
argue
the
equal
protection
issue
here
today,
but
since
you
inquire,
your
honor,
with
respect
to
state
action
and
whether
these
schools
would
be
participating
in
state
action
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
they
receive
some
funding
from
the
state,
i
think
would
be
a
question
of
degree,
i
would
say
it's
a
question,
it
is
a
question.
i
was
thinking
of
the
case
of
powell
versus
miles,
judge
friendly’s
decision
on
the
issue
of
state
action.
and
certainly
it
is
true
that
there's
a
vast
difference
between
receiving
say
10%
of
your
income
from
the
state
and
a
larger
percent
and
what
other
things
may
be
involved
in
creating
the
state
action
situation.
in
a
proper
case,
will
we
have
to
brief
and
argue
that
point
very
thoroughly.
mr.
william
b.
ball
oh
indeed
a
black
could
get
into
one
of
these
catholic
schools
if
he
were
not
a
catholic.
we
have
schools
in
the
inner
city
of
philadelphia.
mr.
william
b.
ball
oh
heavens,
yes.
we
have
schools
in
the
inner—
mr.
william
b.
ball
a
black
agnostic
to
black
protestant
to
black
catholic,
we
have
schools,
your
honor
in
the
inner
city
of
philadelphia
which
have
been
the
tie
together
of
racially
mixed
neighborhoods
over
the
decades
and
which
are
to
a
substantial
extent
made
up
of
protestant
blacks,
who
after
graduation
become
alumni
black
protestants.
mr.
william
b.
ball
every
difference,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
ball
well,
to
begin
with
under
this
act,
the
state
cannot
pay
for
a
religious
textbook
and
under
the
constitution
they
cannot
pay
for
religious
instructional
materials
and
under
the
constitution.
and
thirdly,
this
act
prohibits
any
teacher
from
teaching
or
introducing
any
religious
matter
into
mathematics,
modern
and
foreign
language,
etcetera.
now,
if
the
state
provided
money
for
the
teaching
of
religion
to
support
a
religious
course
which
would
be
patently
unconstitutional,
yes
the
school
might
get,
certainly
the
school
might
get
the
same
income
but
the
constitutional
result
would
be,
183
is
different.
if
a
given
school,
religiously
affiliated
school,
today
were
to
claim
$800.00
for
the
teaching
of
math
during
that
year
and
under
the
act
you're
speaking
of,
the
unconstitutional
act
of
which
you
speak,
your
honor,
it
would
get
$800.00
for
the
teaching
of
religion,
no
financial
difference
but
the
constitutional
difference
would
be
totally
different.
mr.
william
b.
ball
if
the
state
were
to
pay
the
school,
$800.00
for
the
teaching
of
religion,
and
then
the
financial
result
would
be
the
same,
yes
your
honor,
the
financial
result
would
be
the
same.
but
this
of
course
would
have
been
true
of
the
financial
result
in
allen,
this
court
said
as
to
allen
that
in
effect,
the
effect
of
the
new
york
textbook
act
was
to
save
the
schools,
the
parochial
schools,
an
aggregate
sum
of
millions
of
dollars.
this
didn’t
seem
in
the
view
of
the
court
of
walz,
may
1970
to
render
the
act
of
new
york
unconstitutional.
mr.
william
b.
ball
well
this
is
what
he
said,
i
don’t
think
this
is
true
on
the
record
in
allen,
i
think
in
some
situations
they
were
and
in
some
situations
they
were
not.
i
should
like
to
conclude,
your
honor
by
a
quote.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
ball
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly,
are
there
religious
schools
in
which
those
who
control
the
school
hire
and
discharge
the
teacher?
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes,
undeniably
sir.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes
i
cannot
say
as
to
these
seven
schools
which
are
the
only
defendants
in
this
case
but
looking
to
your
question
which
perhaps
relates
to
facial
constitutionality,
yes
i
would
be
sure
that
would
be
so.
may
i
conclude
your
honor?
we
stated
in
page
13
of
our
brief
the
following,
in
our
now
heavily
welfare
oriented
society,
massive
governmental
spending
is
dominant
and
individual
men
and
women,
even
when
banded
together
in
associations
and
institutions,
no
longer
possess
the
economic
resources
with
which
to
maintain
diverse
non-state
endeavors
in
education
and
welfare.
your
honors,
education
is
certainly
the
most
precious
aspect
of
voluntarism
that
we
have,
the
most
meaningful
in
terms
of
a
free
society,
the
economic
and
financial
data
which
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
shows
the
obvious
that
taxes
and
inflation
are
simply
going
to
render
it
impossible
for
schools
such
as
those
that
we
are
describing
to
continue
to
render
service
and
to
give
individual
parents,
the
opportunity
for
a
conscientious
choice
in
education.
i
think
it's
very
clear
that
this
act
on
its
face
is
general
legislation,
it
contains
no
religious
classification
or
gerrymander,
it
is
non-preferential,
it
employs
essentially
religious
means
to
achieve
essentially
secular
ends,
without
any
primary
effect
of
advancing
religion,
inhibiting
religion
and
i
must
refer
you
there
to
our
brief
on
entanglement,
because
we
have
had
an
inadequate
opportunity
to
discuss
the
whole
question
of
entanglement.
but
we
are
up
against
the
facts
of
life
in
pennsylvania,
not
figments
of
fine
spun
doctrine
which
never
proceeded
from
the
minds
of
madison
or
jefferson,
we
are
up
against
such
facts
as
mr.
creamer
has
described.
there
is
no
reasonable
alternative
to
this
act.
pennsylvania
and
her
public
schools
are
bankrupt,
millions
of
parents
and
children
will
be
irreparably
harmed,
if
this
program
which
is
now
in
its
third
year
of
operation
and
going
into
its
fourth
year
of
operation
should
be
terminated.
i
thank
you
your
honors.
