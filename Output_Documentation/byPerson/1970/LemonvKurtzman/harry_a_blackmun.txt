mr.
ball,
help
me
along
at
this
point.
i
don’t
know
whether
you're
making
an
argument
that
need
gets
you
over
a
constitutional
hurdle
or
not
but
this
isn’t
really
what
i
am
concerned
about.
when
the
state
in
the
phraseology
of
the
act
purchases
these
functions,
i
don’t
know
whether
this
is
euphemism
for
a
grant
or
not,
doesn’t
it
free
the
institution
to
use
the
dollars
it
does
have
for
religious
purposes?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
to
what
extent
is
it
plowed
in
if
it
knows
it's
going
to
be
reimbursed?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
is
the
problem
for
the
large
dimensions
–
we
have
indicated
in
some
of
the
cases
from
the
south
that
where
the
state
finances
a
private
school
becomes
a
state
agency.
are
these
state
agencies
and
this
race
is
the
question
with
the
brown
versus
the
board
of
education.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
now
applies
to
this
school.
you
don’t
address
yourself
to
that
in
your
brief,
as
i
read
it
except
to
say
that
the
persons
present
here
didn’t
have
a
standing
to
raise
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
a
black
could
get
into
one
of
these
catholic
schools
even
though
he
wasn’t
a
catholic?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
an
agnostic?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
any
black
could
get
in
there?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun

know
a
lot
of
presbyterian
and
our
presbyterian
schools
always
welcomes
a
chance
to
get
a
catholic
and
work
him
over.
