mr.
l.
pfeffer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
pose
in
the
time
which
i
reserving
for
myself
to
discuss
what
i
believed
to
be
the
legal
principles
applicable
to
this
case
and
with
the
court
permission,
i
should
like
to
extend
my
colleague
mr.
stanzler,
15
minutes
to
apply
these
principles
to
the
specific
facts
of
this
case
as
disclosed
by
the
record
of
the
trial.
this
case,
unlike
lemon
and
unlike
allen
does
present
a
record
on
trial
with
documentary
and
live
witnesses
and
i
believe
that
this
is
a
case
upon
which
the
court
can
get
at
least
a
realistic
glimpse
as
to
what
actually
is
the
effect
of
these
statutes
because
it’s
upon
the
effect
of
the
statutes
that
the
court
tells
that
is
unconstitutional.
this
was
a
unanimous
decision
of
the
court
below.
two
of
the
three
justices
found
are
unconstitutional
on
both
because
its
effect
and
because
it
involved
entanglement,
the
third
judge
fount
it
unconstitutional
only
because
of
entanglement,
but
the
court
below,
majority
holds
it
unconstitutional
on
both
grounds.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
it
is
indeed.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
i
certainly
do.
moreover,
it
transgresses.
it’s
greater
in
degree
and
in
quantity
and
it’s
critically
unconstitutionally
different
in
quality.
every
institution
is
subject
to
a
certain
degree
of
overseeing
by
the
state
for
the
protection
of
the
people.
a
church
which
does
nothing
but
pray,
have
people
pray,
and
participate
in
religious
worship
is
inspected
by
the
fire
department,
by
the
sanitation
department
and
subject
to
tremendous
surveillance
that
there
may
not
be
too
many
people
there,
that
degree
of
surveillance,
that
degree
of
overseeing,
cannot
be
deemed
a
justification
for
financing
that
institution.
this
is
a
necessary
police
power
of
a
state.
but
when
the
state
goes
in,
and
does
not
look
to
see
if
the
ceilings
are
safe,
or
does
not
even
look
to
see
even
goes
beyond
that,
to
look
to
see
the
attendance
record,
but
when
that
state
goes
in
and
pierce
over
the
eyes,
over
the
shoulders
of
a
teacher
to
see
whether
that
teacher
is
permeating
or
bringing
in
religion
into
her
interpretation,
let
us
of
the
reformation,
the
present
reformation,
or
of
the
creation
of
the
earth,
when
or
of
anything
which
has
theological
application.
if
in
a
religious
core,
when
the
state
comes
in
and
says
we
are
going
to
pass
judgments
as
to
whether
this
is
or
is
not
religious,
then
this
is
a
very
type
of
censorship
which
this
court
has
expressed
its
opposition
to
time
and
time
again.
from
watson
against
jones
in
1870,
to
cantwell
against
connecticut
when
the
court
said
we
will
not
allow
a
state
official
to
pass
or
to
censor,
what
is
and
what
is
not
religious.
it
was
in
poulos
against
new
hampshire,
in
case
after
case
for
a
state
official.
this
indeed
--
this
was
one
of
the
statements
made
by
madison
in
his
opposition
to
the
virginia
bill
for
religious
freedom
that
it
empowers
the
state
official
to
determine
what
is
and
what
is
not
religious.
now,
this
is,
to
us
a
critical
difference
between
everything
which
is
gone
hereto
for
and
never
before,
as
far
as
i
know
has
any
courts,
state
or
federal,
authorized
a
state
official
to
pass
judgments
on
whether
certain
teaching
is
religious
or
not.
i
want
to
speak
--
mr.
l.
pfeffer
mr.
justice
white,
the
answer
to
that,
the
one
short
answer
to
that
is,
that
the
first
amendment
does
not
forbid
a
state
to
police
its
own
schools.
these
are
state
schools
that
are
public
schools
and
nothing
in
the
first
amendment
forbids
a
state
to
police
its
own
schools,
and
it
wasn’t
--
mr.
l.
pfeffer
that
teacher
is
a
public
employee
and
must
abide
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
which
says
a
public
employee
in
the
schools
may
not
teach
religion,
may
not
indoctrinate
religion.
this
is
public
employee.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
it
must
only
to
the
extent
of
not
allowing
public
employees
to
do
it.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
it
decides
what
religion
is
to
the
extent
only
of
forbidding
transgression
of
religion
into
the
public
school.
forbidding
transgression
of
the
constitution.
it
does
not,
in
the
case
i’m
quoting
does
not
allow
the
state
to
go
in
and
censor
what’s
taught
in
a
private
school
because
in
that
private
school,
there
is
religion.
this
isn’t
easy
essence
of
religious
limit.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
it
makes
a
comparable
decision
only
in
the
sense
that
it
determines
whether
that
teacher
in
a
public
school
is
fulfilling
the
secular
program
of
the
school.
the
example,
the
best
example
i
think
is
everson.
the
best
example
is
everson
where
the
court
said
you
cannot
forbid
the
teaching
of
evolution
in
a
publicly-financed
school.
now,
the
court
there
made
a
determination
that
the
teaching
of
evolution
is
a
secular
subject.
but
the
court
did
not
in
any
case
i
know
of,
does
not
say
that
it’s
permissible
that
this
doesn’t
involve
the
most
gross
entanglement
for
state
officials
to
go
into
a
religious
core,
created
for
the
purpose
of
propagating
religion,
and
saying,
“we
can
really
check
and
see
whether
during
the
hours
of
nine
to
three
or
two
to
three,
this
particular
teacher
is
teaching
religion.”
this
is
the
most
extreme
form
of
entanglement.
this
situation
means
that
the
teacher
in
the
public
school,
in
the
parochial
school
is
a
part
employee
of
the
parochial
school
system,
part
of
employee
of
the
state.
the
church
selects
the
teacher,
the
church
appoints,
the
church
pays
for
it.
the
teacher
is
subjected
to
discipline
of
the
church.
the
teacher
is
–
and
if
it's
a
member
of
religious
order
and
nothing
of
the
act,
nothing
of
the
acts
forbids
members
of
religious
orders.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
is
a
member
of
religious
order
who
is
a
teacher.
nothing
in
the
act
forbids
members
of
the
religious
order,
if
the
religious
order
decides
to,
which
it
has
every
right,
constitutional
right
to
increase
their
salary
from
$1800.00
to
$4800.00,
which
they
can
do
tomorrow.
nothing
in
the
statute,
nothing
in
the
constitution
forbids
a
member
of
religious
order,
who
takes
an
oath
of
obedience,
and
then
oath
of
poverty
to
qualify
under
the
act.
this
makes
the
state
and
the
church
partners,
and
ever
since
president
taft
was
in
common
channel
with
philippines,
after
we
took
it
off,
he
required
all
public
control
of
the
parochial
schools
there
to
be
withdrawn,
because
he
said
that
church
and
the
state
may
not
be
partners
under
our
system
of
government.
all
i
want
to
say
a
moment,
(inaudible)
and
about
the
fact
that
in
this
case,
although
i
don’t
know
whether
my
opponents
are
resting
on
this
as
a
critical
distinction.
the
payment
is
made
in
this
case
to
the
teacher,
it
doesn’t
go
through,
under
the
statute,
through
the
treasury
of
the
parochial
schools.
i
submit
that
that
is
hardly
a
critical
distinction.
the
legislative
purpose
of
the
act,
the
whole
discussion
of
the
act,
the
fact
that's
predicated
upon
a
crisis
not
of
teachers,
but
of
the
parochial
school
is
quite
clear
that
this
is
a
device
to
aid
and
to
finance
the
operations
of
the
parochial
schools.
indeed,
the
very
fact
that
in
order
for
a
school
to
qualify,
the
teachers
there
must
receive
a
certain
minimum
amount.
this
is
the
first
time,
i've
come
across
a
situation,
where
a
statute
is
enacted
to
benefit
those
who
needed
least
and
to
deprive
those
who
needed
most
of
the
off
of
that.
indeed,
if
this
purpose
of
this
stature
was
to
aid
and
help
the
teacher,
the
answer
would
be
to
lower
the
teachers’
salary,
just
as
enough
and
everything
else.
the
lower
the
teacher's
salary,
the
more
aid
to
be
gotten.
so,
the
teacher
could
have
a
living
salary,
here
is
just
the
opposite.
if
the
teacher
doesn’t
get
a
certain
amount,
the
minimum,
the
teacher
gets
not
from
the
state,
why?
because
the
purpose
of
the
statue
is
to
help
the
school
finance
its
operations.
this
was
agreed
to
and
testified
here
that
the
superintendent
of
schools,
and
catholic
diocese
there,
if
the
state
doesn’t
them
the
money,
we’ll
go
have
to
pay
it,
it's
in
the
record,
it's
in
my
brief.
if
come
out
(inaudible)
the
parish,
the
court
said,
the
superintendent
said,
“if
this
statute
is
unconstitutional,
and
there's
two
questions
by
the
trial
court,
if
this
act
is
unconstitutional,
that
money
would
have
to
come
from
the
parish,
they’ll
be
having
difficulty
raising.
but
no
question,
this
is
a
form
of
subsidizing
the
church
and
helping
it
meet
the
crisis.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
i
would
assume
so,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
that
affect,
but
i
think
that
can
be
assumed.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
no
sir.
(voice
overlap),
your
honor
pointed
out
in
the—
mr.
l.
pfeffer
i'm
not
basing
my
case
on
aid,
i'm
basing
my
case
on
subsidy,
on
financing,
not
aids.
aid
can
be
many
things,
i'm
basing
my
case
on
the
proposition
that
this
is
financing
the
operations
of
a
parochial
school.
it
is
a
subsidy,
whatever
its
disguised,
the
reality
is
that
this
is
a
subsidy,
just
as
much
as
in
lemon,
the
device
used
to
subsidize
is
the
purchase
of
services
contract,
independent
contractor
concept,
the
purchase
of
service.
but
nobody
is
misled
by
that.
everybody
knows
that
the
declaration
of
legislative
purpose
says
these
schools
are
facing
the
financial
crisis
and
in
this
case
too.
these
schools
are
facing
a
financial
crisis,
and
we’ve
got
to
help
them
meet
their
budget,
and
we’ll
do
it
in
this
way
or
in
that
way.
but,
it
would
be
make
a
mockery
of
(inaudible)
of
the
first
amendment,
if
calling
this
thing
a
purchase
of
service
of
contract
or
calling
this
thing
as
salary
supplement.
can’t
be
used
to
blind
the
eye
to
what
actually
is
state
subsidization
of
parochial
schools
and
nothing
but
that.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
and
it's
used
to
be
use
for
ground
purposes
of
playground,
and—
mr.
l.
pfeffer
as
part
of
the
parochial
school.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
reason
i
am
unable
to
answer
the
question
--
(voice
overlap).
mr.
l.
pfeffer
of
all
including
(voice
overlap),
your
respect
your
honor.
my
answer
was
--
i
would
deem
that
on
constitution.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
because
the
purpose
of
a
parochial
school,
and
the
record
shows
is
not
to
provide
children
with
playgrounds.
the
purpose
of
a
parochial
school
is
to
provide
children
with
a
religious
education
together
with
the
secular
education,
not
independent
of
it.
now,
the
record--
mr.
l.
pfeffer
that
a
public
school
cannot
have?
mr.
l.
pfeffer
of
course
it
doesn't
have
such
kind
of
--
mr.
l.
pfeffer
except,
mr.
justice
marshall—
mr.
l.
pfeffer
well,
my
answer
to
that
is,
if
the
playground
in
an
--(voice
overlap)
mr.
l.
pfeffer
well,
i
would
say
that's
what
i
gave
yesterday
in
your
absence
in
the
total
case.
one
of
the
critical
factors
would
be
is,
would
a
non-catholic
child
be
barred
from
entering
that
playground?
if
a
non-catholic
child
would
be
barred
from
entering
that
playground,
i
would
say
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
into
that
playground,
there
don’t
have
to
be
a
student
in
school,
then
i
would
say
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
it's
a
name
of
–
wrote
by
any
other
name.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
i
don’t
care
what--
(voice
overlap)
you
called
a
playground,
a
school
is
isn’t,
it's
a
playground.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
no,
i
didn’t
say
that
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
said
you
can't
do
it
if
you're
limit
it
to
only
those
who
were
students
in
that
school,
and
you
limit
those
students
that
could
only
get
those
(inaudible),
and
you
require
those
students
to
take
religious
teaching,
as
part
of
it.
then,
you
say
if
that
--
mr.
l.
pfeffer
and
does
not
require
that
child
to
participate
in
any
religious
teaching
or
any
religious
practicing.
i
would
say
this
would
not
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
well,
that’s
not
(voice
overlap).
because
it
is
not
the
teaching
or
practice
of
religion,
the
state
does
not
finance
the
teaching
or
practice
of
religion.
the
state
is
providing
a
park
for
every
member
of
the
community
(voice
overlap)
mr.
l.
pfeffer
and
the
school
is
one
in
which
there
is
--
religion
is
not
required
from
the
children,
which
of
all
faith
and
of
no
faith,
and
they're
not
subjected
to
religious
propagation,
religious
practices,
and
the
mere
fact,
that
i
said
yesterday,
the
mere
fact
that
the
school
is
church-related
does
not
disqualify
that.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
if
that
was
so,
that
was
catholic
(inaudible)
towards
constitutionality,
yes
indeed,
because
then
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
promote
the
purpose
of
the
school,
as
the
court
below
said,
and
i
think
very
astutely,
this
is
a
religious
enterprise,
it
is
simply
unrealistic,
and
goes
beyond
everything,
which
we
know
of
education
to
divide
a
school,
which
as
this
court
said
in
walz,
so
recently,
whose
dominant
politics
is
to
control
the
complete
education
of
the
children,
religious,
and
secondly
complete
education,
children
for
their
formative
years.
it
is
simply
beyond
the
realm
of
reality,
to
say
you
can
divide
that
child
up,
and
say
--
in
this
playground,
he's
not
subject
to
the
religious
influences
of
the
school.
he's
not
there
for
the
purpose
of
taking
the
religious
upbringing.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
i'm
sorry--
mr.
l.
pfeffer
yes.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
well,
i
think
the
answer
is
it
was
given
--
the
answer
was
given,
and
i
would
say
this,
if
the
machine
shop
and
the
recreation
center
is
an
integral
part
of
that
institution,
that
educational
institution.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
i
will
come
back
mr.
justice
marshall,
to
what
i've
just
said.
i
want
to
know
if
a
child
is
in
anyway
required
to
participate
in
religious
instruction
or
religious
practice,
or
in
anyway,
his
religion
is
relevant
to
his
enjoyment
of
that
facility.
if
that
is
so,
and
in
this
case,
the
record
shows
specifically
it
is
so.
then,
that
is
not
constitutional,
this
is
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
court
said
in
everson,
you
cannot
deprive
a
person
of
a
public
welfare
benefit,
because
of
his
religion.
and
if
a
child
cannot
enjoy
a
park,
because
it's
not
of
right
religion
or
if
the
child
can't
enjoy
the
park
or
the
gymnasium,
unless
he
partakes
religious
teaching,
it's
seems
to
me
that’s
a
violation
of
the
constitution.
now,
on
the
purpose,
one
word
about
the
purpose,
i've
said
in
tilton,
that
under
the
principle
of
coordinate
branches
of
government,
this
court
may
not,
perhaps
examine
it
beyond
the
stated
purpose
of
the
legislature.
i
do
not
think
that
applies
to
state
statutes.
i
believe
this
court
has
said
in
atchison,
it
said
reitman
against
mulkey,
that
in
fulfilling
its
constitutional
obligation,
the
court
must
examine
to
the
perpetual
realities
of
the
situation,
and
may
not
be
barred
by
a
statement
of
the
purpose.
the
actual
realities
of
this
situation
is
that
parochial
schools
are
in
economic
crisis.
we
have
to
help
them,
we
have
to
help
them,
how?
by
financing
them
on
part.
this
i
submit
is
the
purpose
of
this
statute.
and
if,
as
this
case
shows,
a
parochial
school
system
is
established
and
created
to
maintain
the
religion
of
its
adherence,
then
i
say
that
a
statue,
whose
purpose
is
to
relieve
that
church
of
its
financial
responsibility,
by
taking
part,
then
that’s
the
purpose
that
statute,
is
to
advance
religion.
i
would
like
to
conclude
and
leave
the
balance
to
my
associate,
mr.
stanzler.
but
i
find
it
necessary
to
point
out
the
tremendous
significance
of
these
two
cases
before
this
court,
as
to
the
future
of
a
public
educational
system
in
this
country.
the
public
school
system,
to
me
one
of
the
most
important,
it's
one
of
the
most
important
contribution,
which
our
democracy
has
made
to
civilization.
it
is
the
only
situation,
the
only
institution,
which
has
an
open
door
policy
by
law,
which
no
child
can
be
denied
entrance,
because
of
child’s
color,
the
child’s
wealth
or
lack
of
wealth,
the
child’s
religion
or
lack
of
religion,
it
is
universal.
because
it
is
universal,
because
every
child
can
come
in
without
questions,
the
door
will
never
close
on
a
child
entering
a
public
school,
because
of
that,
that
school
deserves
and
merits
financial
support
and
maintenance,
by
taxes
levied
against
all
of
the
community.
but
once
an
institution
can
close
its
doors,
and
say
before
you
come
in,
i
want
to
know
your
face,
i
want
to
know
your
color,
i
want
to
know
whether
you
have
a
correct
baptismal
certificate,
otherwise
you
don’t
come
in.
i
say
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
does
not
allow
such
an
institution
to
be
supported
by
tax
raise,
and
funds.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
well,
the
record
shows,
it's
on
the
record,
it
shows
that
--
i
will
read
it
to
you
specifically,
that
preference
is
be
given
to--
and
that’s
a
factor
that
all
the
children,
at
least
95%
of
more
--
mr.
l.
pfeffer
of
the
admission
procedure,
as
the
record
shows
that
in
selecting
students,
preference
must
be
given,
should
be
given
to
those
who
participate
--
who
attend
mass.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
you
have
the
page
of
that
--
yes,
it's
page
223
of
the
joint
appendix.
i
will
read
it.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
223.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
of
the
joint
appendix,
here's
what
the
record
shows.
this
is
the
handbook
and
the
rule
stated,
“although
wealth
should
not
serve
as
a
criteria
for
accepting
a
pupil
into
a
catholic
school,
all
other
things
being
equal,
it
would
seem
fair
to
give
preference
to
a
child,
whose
parents
support
the
parish.
regular
use
of
that
budget,
rather
than
size
of
the
contribution
would
appear
equitable.”
in
the
case,
where
the
parents
regularly
attend
mass,
this
is
at
the
very
least,
preferential
treatment
based
upon
religion,
upon
attendance
and
that's
from
the
record.
thank
you.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
i
beg
you
pardon.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
this
is
not
disputed.
it
was
conceded
at
the
trial.
it
was
conceded
at
the
trial
that
this
is
in
effect
that
there
are
certain
things
in
the
handbook,
which
were
challenged,
but
those
things
which
were
not
challenged,
were
conceded
by
the
superintendent
of
schools
of
the
dioceses
of
providence,
that
it
is
in
effect
this
has
been
conceded
to
be
in
effect
uncontraverted.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
i
beg
your
pardon,
yes.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
yes
indeed.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
yes.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
yes.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
all
comes
from
the
archdiocese,
yes.
now,
those
are
criteria,
which
are
perfectly
constitutional
in
the
private
institution.
those
are
criteria
--
but
criteria
and
attendance
of
facts
of
the
parent's
attandance
of
mass,
as
a
factor
in
determining
admissible
or
not
admissible,
is
certainly
not
consistent
with
the
first
amendments
of
the
united
states
constitution.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
pose
in
the
time
which
i
reserving
for
myself
to
discuss
what
i
believed
to
be
the
legal
principles
applicable
to
this
case
and
with
the
court
permission,
i
should
like
to
extend
my
colleague
mr.
stanzler,
15
minutes
to
apply
these
principles
to
the
specific
facts
of
this
case
as
disclosed
by
the
record
of
the
trial.
this
case,
unlike
lemon
and
unlike
allen
does
present
a
record
on
trial
with
documentary
and
live
witnesses
and
i
believe
that
this
is
a
case
upon
which
the
court
can
get
at
least
a
realistic
glimpse
as
to
what
actually
is
the
effect
of
these
statutes
because
it’s
upon
the
effect
of
the
statutes
that
the
court
tells
that
is
unconstitutional.
this
was
a
unanimous
decision
of
the
court
below.
two
of
the
three
justices
found
are
unconstitutional
on
both
because
its
effect
and
because
it
involved
entanglement,
the
third
judge
fount
it
unconstitutional
only
because
of
entanglement,
but
the
court
below,
majority
holds
it
unconstitutional
on
both
grounds.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
it
is
indeed.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
i
certainly
do.
moreover,
it
transgresses.
it’s
greater
in
degree
and
in
quantity
and
it’s
critically
unconstitutionally
different
in
quality.
every
institution
is
subject
to
a
certain
degree
of
overseeing
by
the
state
for
the
protection
of
the
people.
a
church
which
does
nothing
but
pray,
have
people
pray,
and
participate
in
religious
worship
is
inspected
by
the
fire
department,
by
the
sanitation
department
and
subject
to
tremendous
surveillance
that
there
may
not
be
too
many
people
there,
that
degree
of
surveillance,
that
degree
of
overseeing,
cannot
be
deemed
a
justification
for
financing
that
institution.
this
is
a
necessary
police
power
of
a
state.
but
when
the
state
goes
in,
and
does
not
look
to
see
if
the
ceilings
are
safe,
or
does
not
even
look
to
see
even
goes
beyond
that,
to
look
to
see
the
attendance
record,
but
when
that
state
goes
in
and
pierce
over
the
eyes,
over
the
shoulders
of
a
teacher
to
see
whether
that
teacher
is
permeating
or
bringing
in
religion
into
her
interpretation,
let
us
of
the
reformation,
the
present
reformation,
or
of
the
creation
of
the
earth,
when
or
of
anything
which
has
theological
application.
if
in
a
religious
core,
when
the
state
comes
in
and
says
we
are
going
to
pass
judgments
as
to
whether
this
is
or
is
not
religious,
then
this
is
a
very
type
of
censorship
which
this
court
has
expressed
its
opposition
to
time
and
time
again.
from
watson
against
jones
in
1870,
to
cantwell
against
connecticut
when
the
court
said
we
will
not
allow
a
state
official
to
pass
or
to
censor,
what
is
and
what
is
not
religious.
it
was
in
poulos
against
new
hampshire,
in
case
after
case
for
a
state
official.
this
indeed
--
this
was
one
of
the
statements
made
by
madison
in
his
opposition
to
the
virginia
bill
for
religious
freedom
that
it
empowers
the
state
official
to
determine
what
is
and
what
is
not
religious.
now,
this
is,
to
us
a
critical
difference
between
everything
which
is
gone
hereto
for
and
never
before,
as
far
as
i
know
has
any
courts,
state
or
federal,
authorized
a
state
official
to
pass
judgments
on
whether
certain
teaching
is
religious
or
not.
i
want
to
speak
--
mr.
l.
pfeffer
mr.
justice
white,
the
answer
to
that,
the
one
short
answer
to
that
is,
that
the
first
amendment
does
not
forbid
a
state
to
police
its
own
schools.
these
are
state
schools
that
are
public
schools
and
nothing
in
the
first
amendment
forbids
a
state
to
police
its
own
schools,
and
it
wasn’t
--
mr.
l.
pfeffer
that
teacher
is
a
public
employee
and
must
abide
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
which
says
a
public
employee
in
the
schools
may
not
teach
religion,
may
not
indoctrinate
religion.
this
is
public
employee.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
it
must
only
to
the
extent
of
not
allowing
public
employees
to
do
it.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
it
decides
what
religion
is
to
the
extent
only
of
forbidding
transgression
of
religion
into
the
public
school.
forbidding
transgression
of
the
constitution.
it
does
not,
in
the
case
i’m
quoting
does
not
allow
the
state
to
go
in
and
censor
what’s
taught
in
a
private
school
because
in
that
private
school,
there
is
religion.
this
isn’t
easy
essence
of
religious
limit.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
it
makes
a
comparable
decision
only
in
the
sense
that
it
determines
whether
that
teacher
in
a
public
school
is
fulfilling
the
secular
program
of
the
school.
the
example,
the
best
example
i
think
is
everson.
the
best
example
is
everson
where
the
court
said
you
cannot
forbid
the
teaching
of
evolution
in
a
publicly-financed
school.
now,
the
court
there
made
a
determination
that
the
teaching
of
evolution
is
a
secular
subject.
but
the
court
did
not
in
any
case
i
know
of,
does
not
say
that
it’s
permissible
that
this
doesn’t
involve
the
most
gross
entanglement
for
state
officials
to
go
into
a
religious
core,
created
for
the
purpose
of
propagating
religion,
and
saying,
“we
can
really
check
and
see
whether
during
the
hours
of
nine
to
three
or
two
to
three,
this
particular
teacher
is
teaching
religion.”
this
is
the
most
extreme
form
of
entanglement.
this
situation
means
that
the
teacher
in
the
public
school,
in
the
parochial
school
is
a
part
employee
of
the
parochial
school
system,
part
of
employee
of
the
state.
the
church
selects
the
teacher,
the
church
appoints,
the
church
pays
for
it.
the
teacher
is
subjected
to
discipline
of
the
church.
the
teacher
is
–
and
if
it's
a
member
of
religious
order
and
nothing
of
the
act,
nothing
of
the
acts
forbids
members
of
religious
orders.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
is
a
member
of
religious
order
who
is
a
teacher.
nothing
in
the
act
forbids
members
of
the
religious
order,
if
the
religious
order
decides
to,
which
it
has
every
right,
constitutional
right
to
increase
their
salary
from
$1800.00
to
$4800.00,
which
they
can
do
tomorrow.
nothing
in
the
statute,
nothing
in
the
constitution
forbids
a
member
of
religious
order,
who
takes
an
oath
of
obedience,
and
then
oath
of
poverty
to
qualify
under
the
act.
this
makes
the
state
and
the
church
partners,
and
ever
since
president
taft
was
in
common
channel
with
philippines,
after
we
took
it
off,
he
required
all
public
control
of
the
parochial
schools
there
to
be
withdrawn,
because
he
said
that
church
and
the
state
may
not
be
partners
under
our
system
of
government.
all
i
want
to
say
a
moment,
(inaudible)
and
about
the
fact
that
in
this
case,
although
i
don’t
know
whether
my
opponents
are
resting
on
this
as
a
critical
distinction.
the
payment
is
made
in
this
case
to
the
teacher,
it
doesn’t
go
through,
under
the
statute,
through
the
treasury
of
the
parochial
schools.
i
submit
that
that
is
hardly
a
critical
distinction.
the
legislative
purpose
of
the
act,
the
whole
discussion
of
the
act,
the
fact
that's
predicated
upon
a
crisis
not
of
teachers,
but
of
the
parochial
school
is
quite
clear
that
this
is
a
device
to
aid
and
to
finance
the
operations
of
the
parochial
schools.
indeed,
the
very
fact
that
in
order
for
a
school
to
qualify,
the
teachers
there
must
receive
a
certain
minimum
amount.
this
is
the
first
time,
i've
come
across
a
situation,
where
a
statute
is
enacted
to
benefit
those
who
needed
least
and
to
deprive
those
who
needed
most
of
the
off
of
that.
indeed,
if
this
purpose
of
this
stature
was
to
aid
and
help
the
teacher,
the
answer
would
be
to
lower
the
teachers’
salary,
just
as
enough
and
everything
else.
the
lower
the
teacher's
salary,
the
more
aid
to
be
gotten.
so,
the
teacher
could
have
a
living
salary,
here
is
just
the
opposite.
if
the
teacher
doesn’t
get
a
certain
amount,
the
minimum,
the
teacher
gets
not
from
the
state,
why?
because
the
purpose
of
the
statue
is
to
help
the
school
finance
its
operations.
this
was
agreed
to
and
testified
here
that
the
superintendent
of
schools,
and
catholic
diocese
there,
if
the
state
doesn’t
them
the
money,
we’ll
go
have
to
pay
it,
it's
in
the
record,
it's
in
my
brief.
if
come
out
(inaudible)
the
parish,
the
court
said,
the
superintendent
said,
“if
this
statute
is
unconstitutional,
and
there's
two
questions
by
the
trial
court,
if
this
act
is
unconstitutional,
that
money
would
have
to
come
from
the
parish,
they’ll
be
having
difficulty
raising.
but
no
question,
this
is
a
form
of
subsidizing
the
church
and
helping
it
meet
the
crisis.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
i
would
assume
so,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
that
affect,
but
i
think
that
can
be
assumed.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
no
sir.
(voice
overlap),
your
honor
pointed
out
in
the—
mr.
l.
pfeffer
i'm
not
basing
my
case
on
aid,
i'm
basing
my
case
on
subsidy,
on
financing,
not
aids.
aid
can
be
many
things,
i'm
basing
my
case
on
the
proposition
that
this
is
financing
the
operations
of
a
parochial
school.
it
is
a
subsidy,
whatever
its
disguised,
the
reality
is
that
this
is
a
subsidy,
just
as
much
as
in
lemon,
the
device
used
to
subsidize
is
the
purchase
of
services
contract,
independent
contractor
concept,
the
purchase
of
service.
but
nobody
is
misled
by
that.
everybody
knows
that
the
declaration
of
legislative
purpose
says
these
schools
are
facing
the
financial
crisis
and
in
this
case
too.
these
schools
are
facing
a
financial
crisis,
and
we’ve
got
to
help
them
meet
their
budget,
and
we’ll
do
it
in
this
way
or
in
that
way.
but,
it
would
be
make
a
mockery
of
(inaudible)
of
the
first
amendment,
if
calling
this
thing
a
purchase
of
service
of
contract
or
calling
this
thing
as
salary
supplement.
can’t
be
used
to
blind
the
eye
to
what
actually
is
state
subsidization
of
parochial
schools
and
nothing
but
that.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
and
it's
used
to
be
use
for
ground
purposes
of
playground,
and—
mr.
l.
pfeffer
as
part
of
the
parochial
school.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
reason
i
am
unable
to
answer
the
question
--
(voice
overlap).
mr.
l.
pfeffer
of
all
including
(voice
overlap),
your
respect
your
honor.
my
answer
was
--
i
would
deem
that
on
constitution.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
because
the
purpose
of
a
parochial
school,
and
the
record
shows
is
not
to
provide
children
with
playgrounds.
the
purpose
of
a
parochial
school
is
to
provide
children
with
a
religious
education
together
with
the
secular
education,
not
independent
of
it.
now,
the
record--
mr.
l.
pfeffer
that
a
public
school
cannot
have?
mr.
l.
pfeffer
of
course
it
doesn't
have
such
kind
of
--
mr.
l.
pfeffer
except,
mr.
justice
marshall—
mr.
l.
pfeffer
well,
my
answer
to
that
is,
if
the
playground
in
an
--(voice
overlap)
mr.
l.
pfeffer
well,
i
would
say
that's
what
i
gave
yesterday
in
your
absence
in
the
total
case.
one
of
the
critical
factors
would
be
is,
would
a
non-catholic
child
be
barred
from
entering
that
playground?
if
a
non-catholic
child
would
be
barred
from
entering
that
playground,
i
would
say
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
into
that
playground,
there
don’t
have
to
be
a
student
in
school,
then
i
would
say
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
it's
a
name
of
–
wrote
by
any
other
name.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
i
don’t
care
what--
(voice
overlap)
you
called
a
playground,
a
school
is
isn’t,
it's
a
playground.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
no,
i
didn’t
say
that
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
said
you
can't
do
it
if
you're
limit
it
to
only
those
who
were
students
in
that
school,
and
you
limit
those
students
that
could
only
get
those
(inaudible),
and
you
require
those
students
to
take
religious
teaching,
as
part
of
it.
then,
you
say
if
that
--
mr.
l.
pfeffer
and
does
not
require
that
child
to
participate
in
any
religious
teaching
or
any
religious
practicing.
i
would
say
this
would
not
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
well,
that’s
not
(voice
overlap).
because
it
is
not
the
teaching
or
practice
of
religion,
the
state
does
not
finance
the
teaching
or
practice
of
religion.
the
state
is
providing
a
park
for
every
member
of
the
community
(voice
overlap)
mr.
l.
pfeffer
and
the
school
is
one
in
which
there
is
--
religion
is
not
required
from
the
children,
which
of
all
faith
and
of
no
faith,
and
they're
not
subjected
to
religious
propagation,
religious
practices,
and
the
mere
fact,
that
i
said
yesterday,
the
mere
fact
that
the
school
is
church-related
does
not
disqualify
that.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
if
that
was
so,
that
was
catholic
(inaudible)
towards
constitutionality,
yes
indeed,
because
then
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
promote
the
purpose
of
the
school,
as
the
court
below
said,
and
i
think
very
astutely,
this
is
a
religious
enterprise,
it
is
simply
unrealistic,
and
goes
beyond
everything,
which
we
know
of
education
to
divide
a
school,
which
as
this
court
said
in
walz,
so
recently,
whose
dominant
politics
is
to
control
the
complete
education
of
the
children,
religious,
and
secondly
complete
education,
children
for
their
formative
years.
it
is
simply
beyond
the
realm
of
reality,
to
say
you
can
divide
that
child
up,
and
say
--
in
this
playground,
he's
not
subject
to
the
religious
influences
of
the
school.
he's
not
there
for
the
purpose
of
taking
the
religious
upbringing.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
i'm
sorry--
mr.
l.
pfeffer
yes.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
well,
i
think
the
answer
is
it
was
given
--
the
answer
was
given,
and
i
would
say
this,
if
the
machine
shop
and
the
recreation
center
is
an
integral
part
of
that
institution,
that
educational
institution.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
i
will
come
back
mr.
justice
marshall,
to
what
i've
just
said.
i
want
to
know
if
a
child
is
in
anyway
required
to
participate
in
religious
instruction
or
religious
practice,
or
in
anyway,
his
religion
is
relevant
to
his
enjoyment
of
that
facility.
if
that
is
so,
and
in
this
case,
the
record
shows
specifically
it
is
so.
then,
that
is
not
constitutional,
this
is
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
court
said
in
everson,
you
cannot
deprive
a
person
of
a
public
welfare
benefit,
because
of
his
religion.
and
if
a
child
cannot
enjoy
a
park,
because
it's
not
of
right
religion
or
if
the
child
can't
enjoy
the
park
or
the
gymnasium,
unless
he
partakes
religious
teaching,
it's
seems
to
me
that’s
a
violation
of
the
constitution.
now,
on
the
purpose,
one
word
about
the
purpose,
i've
said
in
tilton,
that
under
the
principle
of
coordinate
branches
of
government,
this
court
may
not,
perhaps
examine
it
beyond
the
stated
purpose
of
the
legislature.
i
do
not
think
that
applies
to
state
statutes.
i
believe
this
court
has
said
in
atchison,
it
said
reitman
against
mulkey,
that
in
fulfilling
its
constitutional
obligation,
the
court
must
examine
to
the
perpetual
realities
of
the
situation,
and
may
not
be
barred
by
a
statement
of
the
purpose.
the
actual
realities
of
this
situation
is
that
parochial
schools
are
in
economic
crisis.
we
have
to
help
them,
we
have
to
help
them,
how?
by
financing
them
on
part.
this
i
submit
is
the
purpose
of
this
statute.
and
if,
as
this
case
shows,
a
parochial
school
system
is
established
and
created
to
maintain
the
religion
of
its
adherence,
then
i
say
that
a
statue,
whose
purpose
is
to
relieve
that
church
of
its
financial
responsibility,
by
taking
part,
then
that’s
the
purpose
that
statute,
is
to
advance
religion.
i
would
like
to
conclude
and
leave
the
balance
to
my
associate,
mr.
stanzler.
but
i
find
it
necessary
to
point
out
the
tremendous
significance
of
these
two
cases
before
this
court,
as
to
the
future
of
a
public
educational
system
in
this
country.
the
public
school
system,
to
me
one
of
the
most
important,
it's
one
of
the
most
important
contribution,
which
our
democracy
has
made
to
civilization.
it
is
the
only
situation,
the
only
institution,
which
has
an
open
door
policy
by
law,
which
no
child
can
be
denied
entrance,
because
of
child’s
color,
the
child’s
wealth
or
lack
of
wealth,
the
child’s
religion
or
lack
of
religion,
it
is
universal.
because
it
is
universal,
because
every
child
can
come
in
without
questions,
the
door
will
never
close
on
a
child
entering
a
public
school,
because
of
that,
that
school
deserves
and
merits
financial
support
and
maintenance,
by
taxes
levied
against
all
of
the
community.
but
once
an
institution
can
close
its
doors,
and
say
before
you
come
in,
i
want
to
know
your
face,
i
want
to
know
your
color,
i
want
to
know
whether
you
have
a
correct
baptismal
certificate,
otherwise
you
don’t
come
in.
i
say
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
does
not
allow
such
an
institution
to
be
supported
by
tax
raise,
and
funds.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
well,
the
record
shows,
it's
on
the
record,
it
shows
that
--
i
will
read
it
to
you
specifically,
that
preference
is
be
given
to--
and
that’s
a
factor
that
all
the
children,
at
least
95%
of
more
--
mr.
l.
pfeffer
of
the
admission
procedure,
as
the
record
shows
that
in
selecting
students,
preference
must
be
given,
should
be
given
to
those
who
participate
--
who
attend
mass.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
you
have
the
page
of
that
--
yes,
it's
page
223
of
the
joint
appendix.
i
will
read
it.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
223.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
of
the
joint
appendix,
here's
what
the
record
shows.
this
is
the
handbook
and
the
rule
stated,
“although
wealth
should
not
serve
as
a
criteria
for
accepting
a
pupil
into
a
catholic
school,
all
other
things
being
equal,
it
would
seem
fair
to
give
preference
to
a
child,
whose
parents
support
the
parish.
regular
use
of
that
budget,
rather
than
size
of
the
contribution
would
appear
equitable.”
in
the
case,
where
the
parents
regularly
attend
mass,
this
is
at
the
very
least,
preferential
treatment
based
upon
religion,
upon
attendance
and
that's
from
the
record.
thank
you.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
i
beg
you
pardon.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
this
is
not
disputed.
it
was
conceded
at
the
trial.
it
was
conceded
at
the
trial
that
this
is
in
effect
that
there
are
certain
things
in
the
handbook,
which
were
challenged,
but
those
things
which
were
not
challenged,
were
conceded
by
the
superintendent
of
schools
of
the
dioceses
of
providence,
that
it
is
in
effect
this
has
been
conceded
to
be
in
effect
uncontraverted.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
i
beg
your
pardon,
yes.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
yes
indeed.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
yes.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
yes.
mr.
l.
pfeffer
all
comes
from
the
archdiocese,
yes.
now,
those
are
criteria,
which
are
perfectly
constitutional
in
the
private
institution.
those
are
criteria
--
but
criteria
and
attendance
of
facts
of
the
parent's
attandance
of
mass,
as
a
factor
in
determining
admissible
or
not
admissible,
is
certainly
not
consistent
with
the
first
amendments
of
the
united
states
constitution.
