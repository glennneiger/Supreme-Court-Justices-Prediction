justice

white
state
doesn’t
prescribe
the
textbooks?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
as
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
not
quite
clear
as
to
the
detail
of
how
this
scheme
works.
i
know
you
said
there
was
a
contact,
but
what’s
involved,
as
the
state
authority
accepts
the
representations
of
the
institution?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
is
there
any
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
before
the
money
is
paid,
what
check
is
made
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
summary
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
case
hasn't
become
moot?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
fact,
all
you’re
really
asking
us
for
is
that
you
have
a
chance
to
try
this
case,
isn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
sawyer,
will
you
still
distinguish
the
hospital
situation
even
though
it
maintains
a
chaplaincy
staff.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
about
what
i
was
mentioning
a
chaplaincy
staff,
four
or
five
chaplains
of
a
particular
denomination
maintained
by
the
hospital,
does
this
make
a
difference?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
same
thing
goes
about
tuition
grants?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
there's
a
difference
between
purpose
and
effect?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
there
are
separate
tests?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
what
i
said
in
the
concurrence
in
schempp
was
after
joining,
the
court's
purpose
and
effect
test,
mine
was
simply
an
elaboration
on
the
purpose
and
effect
test?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don’t
think
that
that
concurrence
regarded
them
as
separate
tests.
justice
byron
r.
white
no
i
don’t
suggest
that,
i
say
that
that
was
a
purpose
and
effect
test
and
some
other
test,
entanglement
or
involvement.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
legislative
findings
of
it
mr.
sawyer?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
the
state
has
ascertained
that
the
school
has
paid
for
such
instruction,
what
does
that
mean?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
what
does
audit
mean?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
inquiry
is
made
whether
in
fact
these
three
items
of
expense
do
or
do
not
involve
any
religious
instructions?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
the
teachers
include
whom?
justice
byron
r.
white
may
they
be
nuns?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
may
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
these
inspections
contemplate
on
the
inquiry
into
--
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
be
concerned?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there
were
a
inquiry
into
what
a
particular
nun
did
or
whose
expense,
reimbursement
or
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
wondering
if
you’d
be
concerned
as
to
that
kind
of
inspection
of
member
of
a
religious
--
justice
byron
r.
white
on
what
school?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
ball
let
me
get
back
to
one
question
and
i’ll
stop.
what
difference
in
the
ultimate
result
is
there
under
the
pennsylvania
plan
and
if
it
provided
x
dollars
for
the
purchase
of
religious
instruction?
is
there
any
difference
in
the
ultimate
result?
justice
byron
r.
white
how,
the
schools
end
up
financially
exactly
the
same
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
except
that
the
school
is
using
its
other
dollars
for
what
is
not
replaced
by
the
state
act,
would
not
result
identically
the
same,
is
it
not
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
to
say
that
the
difference
in
allen
was
that
the
parents
there
to
for
had
been
paying
for
the
books.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
the
individual
teacher.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
is
the
payment
made
to
the
teachers
as
her
salary
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
directly
to
the
teacher?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
nuns
take
a
vow
of
poverty?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
public
school
laws
that
say
that
religion
cannot
be
taught
in
the
public
schools?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
about
the
teacher
though,
says
you’re
transgressing
the
first
amendment,
my
first
amendments
right
and
you’re
purporting
to
say
that
i’m
teaching
religion
and
you’re
supposed
to
keep
your
nose
on
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you’re
saying
that
it’s
inherent
in
the
first
amendment
that
the
state
must
in
all
sorts
of
context
decide
what
religion
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
anyway
the
state
does
it
all
the
time.
i
mean,
decides
what
religion
is.
