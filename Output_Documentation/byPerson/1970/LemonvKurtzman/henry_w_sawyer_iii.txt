mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
dismissal
of
a
complaint
of
three
individual
taxpayers
and
several
organizations
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
a
pennsylvania
statute
act
109
which
provides
for
the
payment
of
tax
money
to
non
public
schools
to
reimburse
them
for
the
cost
of
teaching
mathematics,
modern
and
foreign
languages,
physical
science
and
physical
education.
the
complaint,
alleged
violation
of
the
first
amendment’s
religious
clause
and
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
three-judge
court
dismissed
the
complaint
on
the
first
amendment
grounds
of
the
basis
of
a
fair
and
steady
cause
of
action,
no
answer,
no
discovery,
no
trial,
no
record.
on
the
fourteenth
amendment,
ground
for
a
lack
of
standing
in
all
parties.
when
this
act
was
passed,
it
was
without
precedent
in
the
united
states.
it's
scheme
is
simply
this,
any
non-public
school
has
but
to
fill
out
a
form
and
submit
it,
setting
forth
its
cost
in
these
subjects
for
teacher
salaries,
teaching
materials
and
for
textbooks
and
that
state
forth
with
pays
that
amount
over
to
the
school.
the
transaction
is
labeled,
purchase
of
services
contract.
as
judge
hastie,
dissenting
below
said,
nevertheless
and
i
quote
“the
state
buys
no
services
and
the
school
sells
none.
there
are
no
new
children
involved,
there
is
no
new
teaching”.
the
pedagogical
status
quo
in
pennsylvania
is
precisely
the
same
as
it
was
before
the
act,
the
only
difference
is
economic.
the
act
provides
for
considerable
new
state
regulations
of
the
schools,
the
non
public
schools
and
when
i
say
non
public,
it’s
to
be
understood
of
course
that,
these
are
largely
church
affiliated
schools,
97%.
and
97%
of
that,
97%
is
roman
catholic.
the
act
calls
for
inspection
of
textbooks
for
testing
the
pupils
and
for
certain
levels
of
performance
and
that’s
new,
for
the
certification
of
teachers
after
a
passage
of
time
and
that’s
new.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
no
sir,
they
are
submitted.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes
sir.
for
auditing
procedures
and
for
regulating
of
teaching
content
and
those
provisions
of
the
act
are
in
the
record
at
page
20,
20
to
24.
there
were
17.5
million
under
the
act
this
year,
first
year
was
five
and
that’s
in
the
record
but
since
then,
17.5
million.
now
the
complaint
alleged
particular
violations
of
the
establishment
and
freedom
of
exercise
clause
and
there
was
no
question
raised
about
its
adequacy
as
a
pleading.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
they
had
like
on
a
form,
your
honor,
that
says
that
the
cost
for
teacher
salaries,
for
teaching
materials
and
for
textbooks
was
such
and
such
for
teaching
let’s
say
mathematics
and
then
they
submit
that
to
the
state
and
the
state
pays
them
the
money.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
oh
yes
there’s
an
order,
there's
an
order
of
whether
or
not—
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
see
we
don’t
know
your
honor,
we
have
no
record.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
we
can
only
glean
this
from
the
statute
because
there's
no
record
so
we
never
found
put
how
the
state
goes
about
these
procedures,
the
crown
of
my
appeal
is
that
there
should
have
been
--
after
all
i'm
here
on
an
appeal
from
a
motion
to
dismiss,
the
granting
of
motion
to
dismiss
and
i
will
be
unable
to
inform
you
about
a
number
of
things
because
there
isn’t
any
record.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
sir,
a
motion
was
made
to
dismiss
the
complaint
for
fair
and
a
steady
clause
of
action
for
a
lack
of
a
substantial
federal
question.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
no
sir
and
unlike
allen,
it’s
not
an
allen
situation
where
both
sides
cross
move
for
summary
judgment
after
answering
and
nothing
happened
in
this
case
except
the
complaint
was
filed
and
the
complaint
was
dismissed
on
motion
but
one
justice
descending.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes
sir,
they
owe
the
money.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
well
no
because
that
depends
on
how
much
is
available
and
now
the
first
year,
there
was
only
4
million
so
that
was
a
pro-rata.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
well
horse
raising
and
now
cigarette
tax.
it's
17.5
and
i
understand
schedule
mr.
shane
creamer
can
tell
you
this.
i
understand
it
will
certainly
go
to
38
million
in
the
forthcoming
year,
although
on
sunday
night
at
midnight,
the
state
of
pennsylvania,
officially
went
bankrupt
according
to
the
governor
and
so
all
of
these
bills
are
probably
in
limbo.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
no
sir,
may
it
please
the
court,
act
109
is
pennsylvania’s
assessment
bill.
after
200
years,
the
pennsylvania
assembly
attempts
what
the
virginia
assembly
attempted
and
which
madison
and
jefferson
deferred
the
similarities
were
striking.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes
sir
but
you
can
facially
declare
it
unconstitutional,
i
do
want
to
address
myself
to
that,
for
several
grounds
on
which
this
court
could
find
it
facially
unconstitutional.
cases,
of
course
here
your
honor,
it
must
be
realistic
and
valid,
it's
—
it
presents
problems
on
many
levels,
there
is
the
legal
level,
the
traditional
level.
this
little
question
that
the
traditional
church
state
doctrine
is
evolved
by
this
court
would
appear
to
require
the
invalidation
of
this
act.
i
discern
eight
grounds
on
which
church
cases
have
been
founded
by
this
court
and
i
venture
to
say
this
is
the
first
piece
of
legislation
ever
before
this
court
didn’t
violate
all
eight
and
i’ll
come
to
that
in
a
moment
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
the
court
below
thought
not
that
question
was
raised,
it’s
tax
money
and
one
of
my
plaintiffs
went
to
the
horse
race
and
paid
the
tax
and
he
was
the
only
one
found
to
have
admission,
i
think
the
court
ruled
on
that,
i
think
a
tax
is
a
tax
and
public
money
is
public
money
for
this
purpose.
there
might
be
other
cases
where
you
a
great
deal
question
what
the
source
is.
but
when
you
get
to
the
fundamentals
of
the
first
amendment,
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
think
public
money
is
public
money,
makes
no
difference
whether
it's
a
special
tax,
you
can't
isolate
it.
when
there's
only
there
to
read
to
skim
of
the
briefs
here
to
become
aware
your
honors
and
it's
certainly
true
that
the
controversy
here
is
pregnant
with
other
issues.
the
appellees
say
in
their
brief
and
as
they
said
it
at
harrisburg
that
unless
relief
and
unless
subsidy
is
forthcoming,
the
parochial
school
system
will
wither
and
decline.
on
the
other
hand,
the
attackers
of
the
bill
point
out
at
a
different
level
that
the
effectiveness
will
be
to
perpetuate
the
effect
of
racial
segregation
that’s
exemplified
by
the
non-public
school
system.
on
still
another
level,
the
proponents
say,
having
predicted
the
demise
of
the
non-public
school
system
that
the
resulting
exclusively
public
system
will
be
deleterious
to
pluralistic
society
and
we
rejoin,
i
suppose
that
what
you're
heading
for
here
is
a
dual
school
system,
it's
act
is
sustained,
the
one
primarily
affluent
and
suburban
and
white
and
at
least
typically
white
and
suburban
and
elitist
and
the
other
poor,
inferior,
practically
custodial
and
black.
and
that
there
are
nations
that
have
those
systems
and
this
is
what
we’re
heading
for.
if
we’re
talking
simply
about
the
traditional
doctrine,
there's
no
precedent
of
course,
because
there's
no
present
legislation,
the
cases
after
shemport
(ph)
discussed.
they
lead,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
conclusion
that
unless
the
law
is
to
be
changed,
the
stack
must
go
down.
i
do
want
to
mention
bradfield,
however
since
it's
come
up,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
first
of
all
yesterday.
now
bradfield
as
a
precedent
i
think,
your
honor.
i'm
not
speaking
about
the
situation
of
bradfield
because
i’ll
talk
about
that
too.
as
a
precedent,
i
think
bradfield
doesn’t
need
to
troubles
because
rightly
or
wrongly,
and
i
have
a
footnote
which
covers
bradfield
in
my
brief
at
some
length
on
page
19
and
there,
the
supreme
court
rightly
or
wrongly
just
didn’t
reach
the
first
amendment
issue
because
they
simply
said,
the
fact
that
this
corporation,
a
hospital
corporation’s
members
are
composed
of
religious
people
and
they
happen
to
be
catholics,
doesn’t
make
it
sectarian
any
more
than
it
would
if
they
were
methodists
and
they
concluded,
finally
we
are
not
able
to
say
and
i'm
quoting,
“we
are
not
able
to
say
that
the
compliant
in
this
bill
shows
that
the
corporation
is
for
the
kind
described
but
on
the
contrary,
he
has
clearly
shown
it
is
not.
now,
that
doesn’t
get
us
away
from
the
question
and
the
question
is
how
about
hospitals?
because
hospitals
are
in
a
relationship
with
the
state
and
that’s
true
in
pennsylvania
today.
they
are
paid
so
much
for
them
or
indigent
patients
selected
by
the
state
and
sent
to
them
for
treatment.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes
sir
but
not
if
they're
sectarian.
not
if
they're
sectarian,
that’s
my
understanding
and
here
again
we’re
without
a
record
so
your
honor
has
asked
me,
i
was
on
the
board
of
this
group
of
hospital
in
philadelphia
and
we
added
not
(inaudible)
of
the
board,
we
did
a
number
of
things
of
that
kind,
we
did
attach
ourself
for
all
relationship
with
the
archdiocese
in
order
to
get
hill-burton
funds.
now,
i
think
that’s
what
happens
in
the
hospital
cases.
i'm
speaking
of
the
kind
of
thing
that
might
be
analogous
to
our
situation,
that
as
you
treat
a
patient
and
you
get
paid
so
much.
my
rationale
is
this,
and
these
are
the
differences
and
i
think
they
probably
all
have
to
exist
for
the
hospital
situation
to
prevail
constitutionally.
first
of
all,
to
recognize
that
it
is
not
a
church
and
the
care
of
the
sick
is
not
a
mandated,
a
mandated
religious
function,
it’s
part
of
the
good
work
ethics
of
most
all
religions.
it
doesn’t
therefore
teach
or
proselytize,
it
does
not
prefer,
i
don’t
think
exclusion
is
necessary,
i
think
any
distinct
preference
is
sufficient
to
make
it
unconstitutional
and
finally,
and
most
important,
this
is
true
purchase
of
services.
here
the
purchase
of
service
is
not
a
subterfuge,
here
the
status
quo
is
not
the
same
after
as
before
because
new,
specific
individuals
who
are
discernible
and
could
be
tracked
or
treated
who
would
not
be
treated
if
they
were
not
for
the
use
of
this
facility.
so
i
think
all
of
those
differences
are
important
to
the
situation
and
i
don’t,
for
one
minute
agree
if
mr.
pfeffer
did,
i'm
not
quite
sure
he
did
that
the
state
can
subsidize
a
church
to
carry
out
a
secular
function.
i
think
it
can
only
do
that
zorach
v.
clausonunder
very
special
circumstances
and
the
hospital
one
is
one
of
the
very
few
that
i
can—
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes
i
think
the
mere
maintenance
--
all
of
these
other
qualification
is
present,
the
mere
maintenance
of
a
chapel
somewhere
on
the
premises
would
not
be
sufficient
but
i
think
if
somebody
said
that
i
don’t
think
you
can
be
made
to
go
through
the
chapel
either
on
your
way
to
be
cured
or
in
thanks
for
having
been
cured
on
your
way
out.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
your
honor
i
think
you
keep
adding
things
and
finally
we
will
get
to
the
point.
by
itself,
i
would
say
no,
not
if
there's
not
any
opportunity
of
the
charitable
patients
in
any
way,
the
mere
availability
of
the
staff,
i
would
say
no.
but
i
think
you
can
keep
adding
until
it
begins
to
be
a
permeation
of
the
curing
function
with
the
religious
function.
now
i
do
want
to
mention
allen
because
the
briefs
in
allen,
all
the
briefs
in
allen
misstate
allen’s
facts
and
i
must
say
that
--
i
have
to
say
that
that
misstatement
is
based
on
a
misapprehension,
i
think
of
allen’s
facts
in
the
walz
opinion.
i'm
referring
to
the
--
it
is
alleged
that
the
court
in
allen
sustained
a
new
york
book
law
even
though
the
affect
was
to
relieve
the
schools
of
quote,
walz
said,
“the
enormous
aggregate
cost
for
those
books”.
now
actually,
the
footnote
in
the
allen
case,
footnote
6
makes
it
clear
that
the
parents
previously
bought
the
books,
not
the
schools
so
that
there
was
no
relieving
of
the
burden
previous,
that
the
school
previously
had
carried.
now
there's
another
point
in
allen,
factual
point
that
i
haven’t
seen
coming
as
the
one
at
all
and
that
is
this
--
that
prior
to
the
1965
amendment
in
new
york,
the
state
didn’t
pay
for
public
school
children’s
books.
they
could
be
paid
for
by
a
special
provision,
703
with
a
local
tax.
but
you
see,
that
means
that
there,
the
new
york
legislature
was
conferring
a
benefit
namely
free
books
on
all
children
that
had
not
previously
existed.
it
is
quite
clear,
you'll
see
that
in
a
footnote
in
the
allen
case
at
the
very
beginning
in
justice
white’s
opinion
that
until
1965,
and
i'm
quoting
from
the
second
paragraph,
the
state
purchased
books
and
so
and
so
to
rent
or
sell
the
books
to
the
public
school
children.
and
now
therefore,
the
preamble
there
that
they
were
doing
--
standard
for
education
took
on
some
plausibility
and
they
were
supplying
to
all
children
something
they
didn’t
have
before
and
indeed,
could
this
court
have
said
in
allen
that
the
new
york
statute
was
unconstitutional
unless
in
the
process
of
giving
books
to
all
children,
the
new
york
legislature
had
said
but
catholic
children
can't
have
them?
now
the
analogy
in
pennsylvania,
you
see
would
be
if
pennsylvania
in
order
to
fulfill
a
lack
of
teaching
in
mathematics
and
the
physical
sciences,
etcetera,
a
lack
of
teaching
had
set
up
somewhere
either
tutoring
or
some
facilities
that
teach
these
four
subjects.
and
then
you
have
that
kind
of
situation
and
then
would
we
come
in
and
say,
well
the
pennsylvania
act
is
unconstitutional
because
it
doesn’t
exclude
catholic
children
from
these
facilities
but
of
course
nothing
like
that
happened.
now
in
that
sense,
allen
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
teach
them
free?
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
that’s
a
hypothetical
situation,
your
honor
that
i
would
think
would
be
constitutional.
i
think
you
could
offer
--
the
state
can
offer
free
education
to
anybody
even
if
the
free
education
includes
education
as
to
how
to
educate
in
the
catholic
school.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
i
see
a
lot
of
problems
with
that
kind
of
legislation
your
honor
and
of
course
it
talked
about,
i
don’t
know
how
this
court
would
resolve
that
problem,
i
think
it's
difficult,
there's
entanglement
there,
there's
a
really
involvement
problems.
i
really
am
not
trying
to
evade
it.
i
thought
about
it
and
i'm
not
at
all
sure,
your
honor
how
i
could
brief
that
question
to
this
court,
i
think
it's
a
very,
very
close
case.
it
certainly
is
not
this
one.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes
sir,
voucher
kind
of
plan,
i
think
presents
problems
but
with
there
i
think
i
can
say
with
confidence
that
the
constitutional
magnitude
of
the
problems
in
the
voucher
plan
are
pale
and
insignificant
as
compared
with
this
pennsylvania
situation.
i
want
to
mention
just
this
about
walz,
walz
certainly
made
one
important
negative
point.
quite
clearly,
walz
refused
to
validate
the
exemption
there
on
the
ground
that
churches,
by
good
works,
by
welfare
and
charitable
works,
perform
a
secular
function
which
otherwise
were
have
to
be
performed
with
public
expense.
the
chief
justice
clearly
renounced,
speaking
for
the
court,
clearly
renounced
that
rationale.
that
seems
to
me
to
pretty
well
jeopardize
the
argument
of
the
appellees
that
the
main
reason
of
this
is
constitutional
is
because
this
is
a
secular
function
and
that
the
fact
is
being
performed
by
a
church
makes
no
difference.
the
other
important
thing
is
the
concept
in
walz
--
both
interdependence
and
entanglement.
i
think
they
are
somewhat
different.
here
in
the
interdependence,
is
on
the
face
of
this
act.
the
legislature
has
said,
we
are
now
dependent
on
the
church
school
system
to
carry
out
our
mandated
constitutional
duty
of
educating
children
and
in
the
brief
filed
here,
the
church
has
now
said,
we
are
dependent
upon
the
state
subsidy
to
carry
out
our
church
mandated
function
of
educating
adherence
to
our
faith.
as
to
entanglement,
and
i
think
the
very
core
of
walz
was
entanglement
because
it
seems
quite
clear
that
that
it
was
the
concern
of
the
court
that
taxation
would
mean
more
entanglement
than
exemption.
as
to
entanglement,
this
act
has
a
great
deal
of
it,
far
more
than
i
think
any
of
the
other
legislation
involved
in
this
series
of
cases.
not
only
these
inspections
and
these
teacher
gradings
and
all
of
those
new
rules
but
very,
very
important,
section
iii
(iii)
of
the
act
109
forbids,
“any
subject
matter
expressing
religious
teaching
or
the
morals
or
forms
of
worship
of
any
sect,”
to
enter
into
the
teaching
of
these
subjects.
now
does
this
not
require
the
state
to
conduct
a
very
continuing
surveillance
to
use
the
chief
justice’s
words
which
the
chief
justice
said
was
the
very
hallmark
of
entanglement,
impermissible
entanglement.
now,
we
don't
charger
there's
going
to
be
a
wholesale
evasion
of
this
by
let's
say
the
catholic
schools
but
we
do
say
that
it's
only
an
arch
secularist
who
would
insist
on
the
immutable
secularity
of
any
subject,
particularly
something
like
physical
science.
i
mean
after
all
it
was
astronomy
and
not
theology
that
got
galileo
in
trouble,
and
the
physical
science
is
all
upfront,
it
seems
to
me
with
the
temptation
and
likelihood.
in
fact,
i
think
that
we
could
prove
if
we
had
discovered
that
a
cleric
should
not
and
ought
not
to
teach
astronomy
without
making
it
god-oriented
in
a
religious
school.
now,
i
think
the
state
has
got
to
therefore
police
this,
and
i
don’t
think
that
any
gumshoe
from
the
department
of
education
should
be
lurking
around
to
see
if
sister
mary
is
using
the
bible
in
french
to
teach
the
french
language
instead
of
voltaire.
i
think
it's
unconstitutional,
i
guess
the
worst
kind
of
entanglement
with
vengeance.
now
as
to
the
purpose
and
effect
test,
of
course,
the
district
court
ignored
the
fact
because
we
had
no
record.
as
purpose,
they
took
the
act’s
preamble,
they
took
the
act’s
self-serving
declarations
of
secularity,
they
refused
to
look—
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
i
think
there
are
separate
tests.
well,
there
are
two
aspects
to
one
of
the
tests
i
think
they
could
be
separate,
yes
because,
i
think
as
it
was
articulated
both
by
chief
justice
warren
in
mcgowan
and
by
your
honor
in
your
concurring
opinion
in
schempp
that
both
requirements
had
to
be
satisfied,
therefore
in
that
sense
they
could
be
separate
because
if
either
the
primary
effect.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes
sir.
i
think
they
can
be
separate.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
you
think
you
did
not
separate
between
purpose
and
effect,
there’s
two
tests.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
well
i
think
your
honor,
i
really
think
that
all
of
these
tests
and
i
think
there
are
eight
threads,
are
a
seamless
web.
i
think
everyone
affects
every
other
one
fascinatingly
enough
every
single
one
can
be
found
on
the
memorial
and
remonstrants.
not
one
single
one
of
the
tests
that
the
courts
uses,
i
do
not
find
somewhere
in
the
language
of
that
document.
but
as
the
purpose,
the
district
court
simply
refused
to
look
at
the
legislative
history
and
this
is
official
legislative
history
because
pennsylvania
prints
it
all
apparently
on
the
mistaken
notion
that
i
was
trying
to
get
them
to
examine
into
the
motives
of
the
legislator.
well
i
wasn’t
getting
into
the
motives,
i
was
talking
about
the
committee
reports
and
the
full
legislative
history
and
the
significance
is
this.
the
appellees
say
the
purpose
here
is
to
provide
children
in
pennsylvania
with
instruction
in
these
four
subjects
as
the
preamble
said.
well,
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history,
you’ll
find
that
nobody
ever
suggested
there
was
any
such
problem.
nobody
ever
suggested
there
were
any
children
in
pennsylvania
than
not
being
instructed
in
these
subjects.
if
that
had
been
the
search,
the
committee
would
have
explored
presumably
for
alternative
means
of
teaching
these
subjects.
what
they
explored
was
all
of
the
ordinate
means
of
giving
aid
to
the
parochial
schools
from
shared
time
and
all
the
way
through
to
this
device
which
they
finally
adopted.
it
means,
it
seems
to
me
there’s
only
one
question
and
that’s
whether
or
not
the
supposed
exigencies,
economic
exigencies
of
the
subject,
the
overwhelming
sociological
considerations
are
such
as
to
persuade
this
court
to
assure
strict
construction
in
submission
to
what
is
said
to
be
the
practical
realities.
and
you're
asked
to
do
this
by
the
way
without
a
record.
now
there's
been
a
contention
of
fact
made
here
and
that
is
that
if
the
aid
isn’t
forthcoming,
this
school
system
will
wither
and
die.
i
don’t
think
it's
relevant,
if
it
is
relevant,
it
must
be
pleaded,
it
must
be
proved
and
i'm
entitled
certainly
to
extensive
discovery
on
the
question
because
here
the
appellees
in
effect
are
asking
this
court
to
take
judicial
notice
of
a
point
of
economics
and
sociology
about
their
school
system
which
by
the
way
the
known
statistical
data
is
on
which
it's
quite
equivalent
with
this
point,
you
know
we’re
having
a
decline
in
all
schools
at
that
level.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
the
simple
finding
was
that
there's
a
financial
crisis,
that’s
all.
and
of
course
i
know
of
no
institution
and
our
society
except
perhaps
the
military
that
isn’t
in
a
financial
crisis
and
i
assure
that
the
schools
are
--
the
public
schools
are
in
a
financial
crisis
and
i
accept
that
but
there’s
no
finding
in
the
sense
that
so
many
schools,
this
and
the
closing
there
have
been
consolidations.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
in
my
view,
your
honor,
it
doesn’t
bear
at
all
and
there's
no
doctrine
that
says
that
if
something
is
more
expensive,
to
be
done
constitutionally,
that’s
a
grounds
for
doing
it
unconstitutionally.
but
we
cannot
be
unaware
your
honor
with
a
massive
amicus
briefs
that
this
issue
has
certainly
upturned
itself
very
much
into
this
case
then
is
raised
by
the
appellees
in
the
brief
in
this
court
and
it's
there
and
they
say
it's
there.
i'm
skeptical
as
to
agree
that
it's
there
and
i’d
like
to
have
discovery
on
the
question
before
a
vast
principle
of
constitutional
law
is
asked
to
be
decided
by
this
court
on
the
supposition
that
there
is
this
kind
of
practical
problem.
and
to
speak
very
candidly,
raised
by
a
church
where
the
figures
would
show
that
the
capital
of
assets
of
the
church
vastly
exceed
that
of
every
other
denomination
in
the
united
states
combined.
and
i
don’t,
for
one
believe
that
because
of
financial
difficulty
that
the
catholic
church
is
going
to
give
up
a
mandated
function
for
which
they
fought
and
indeed
in
philadelphia
in
1941
died
for
the
principle
in
the
condition
of
affluence
in
which
everyone
in
society
now
finds
themselves.
now,
i
must
get
on
if
i
may
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
point,
there
the
court
said
no
standing,
in
any
of
my
plaintiffs,
the
charge
was
that
the
non-public
schools
or
de
facto
racially
segregated
rather
by
reason
of
policy
or
tradition
or
practice
or
cost
or
residential
pattern
that
they
are.
but
basically
it's
a
white
school
system,
the
figures
that
are
available
from
public
sources
are
in
the
brief.
again
we
have
no
record.
the
idea
is
this,
that
with
this
amount
of
tax
money
going
to
these
schools,
they
are
sufficiently
quasi
public
so
that
if
they
discriminate
and
segregate
that
is
state
action
reachable
by
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
as
for
standing,
i
think
it's
a
case
where
to
find
out
whether
or
not
mr.
lemon,
who
is
a
negro
parent
with
negro
children
in
the
public
school
than
who
alleges
in
his
complaint
a
deleterious
effect
upon
his
children’s
schools
by
reason
of
the
subsidy
to
the
others,
whether
he
has
a
sufficient
personal
stake
in
the
outcome
which
has
been
the
touchstone
of
standing
in
these
matters,
he
is
a
taxpayer,
would
be
illuminated
by
discovery.
i
think
the
two
are
interchangeable
because
it
may
depend
indeed
on
how
pervasive
the
segregation
is
and
how
much
discrimination
there
is,
and
we
can't
find
out
any
of
that
without
discovery
in
the
matter.
now
i
mentioned,
--
well
one
point
more
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
point,
mr.
douglas,
not
so
long
ago
said
this
in
jones
against
mayer
said
the
contrivances
with
some
states
have
concocted
to
afford
to
command
of
our
decision
in
brown
versus
board
of
education
are
by
now
legendary.
now,
i
for
one
can't,
(inaudible)
how
if
you
validate
a
purchase
of
services
contracts
scheme
where
in
fact,
no
new
educational
benefit
is
being
conferred,
it's
merely
a
method
of
channeling
funds,
how
that
device
is
not
going
to
be
available
to
the
formerly,
they
adjure
state
still
resisting
brown
v.
board
of
education.
maybe
that’s
possible
to
cut
it.
i
for
one
would
think
difficult.
now
i
said
in
the
beginning
that
i
thought
there
were
eight
tests
used
by
the
court
and
that
this
act
violated
all
of
them,
just
in
a
sentence,
first
of
all
the
general
flat
principle
no
tax
money
to
churches
coming
down
from
the
memorial
or
remonstrants
might
stay
through
the
language
of
many,
many
of
these
cases
and
that’s
on
the
face
of
the
act.
then
the
primary
purpose,
if
that’s
one
and
primary
effect,
primary
purpose,
it
seems
clear
from
legislative
history,
primary
effect,
we
do
need
discovery,
i
think
one
can
discern
that
there
is
some
primary
effect.
then
the
concept
of
sponsorship
which
was
in
mccollum,
it
was
certainly
an
angle,
mr.
justice
brennan
distinguished
the
zorach
v.
clauson
situation
from
the
mccollum
situation
on
that
basis,
it
was
in
schempp
that
is
the
state
must
not
sponsor
or
even
appear
to
sponsor
a
religion
which
is
one
of
the
points
of
schempp.
then
preference,
the
fact
that
this
act
manifestly
prefers
one
religion
over
all
others
and
prefers
that
very
most
two
or
three
religions
over
all
others
and
affirmatively
discriminates
against
those
religions
too
poor,
too
scattered
to
even
think
about
running
a
school
system
black
store
front,
mission
type
of
churches
for
instance.
then
interdependence,
and
that’s
on
the
face
of
the
act
because
the
act
says
it's
dependent.
entanglement
and
that’s
shown
by
section
iii
(iii).
excuse
me
your
honor,
i
didn’t
see
the
red
light.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
thank
you
sir,
i
have
just
one
more.
entanglement
and
finally
point
eight,
if
it's
secular,
the
act
nonetheless
does
use
religious
means
to
accomplish
a
secular
end.
and
in
my
research
i
find
no
matter
before
this
court
in
which
all
aid
of
those
tests
would
appear
and
some
facially,
three
facially
to
be
violated
by
the
pennsylvania
act,
and
thank
you
for
your
indulgence
your
honor.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
dismissal
of
a
complaint
of
three
individual
taxpayers
and
several
organizations
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
a
pennsylvania
statute
act
109
which
provides
for
the
payment
of
tax
money
to
non
public
schools
to
reimburse
them
for
the
cost
of
teaching
mathematics,
modern
and
foreign
languages,
physical
science
and
physical
education.
the
complaint,
alleged
violation
of
the
first
amendment’s
religious
clause
and
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
three-judge
court
dismissed
the
complaint
on
the
first
amendment
grounds
of
the
basis
of
a
fair
and
steady
cause
of
action,
no
answer,
no
discovery,
no
trial,
no
record.
on
the
fourteenth
amendment,
ground
for
a
lack
of
standing
in
all
parties.
when
this
act
was
passed,
it
was
without
precedent
in
the
united
states.
it's
scheme
is
simply
this,
any
non-public
school
has
but
to
fill
out
a
form
and
submit
it,
setting
forth
its
cost
in
these
subjects
for
teacher
salaries,
teaching
materials
and
for
textbooks
and
that
state
forth
with
pays
that
amount
over
to
the
school.
the
transaction
is
labeled,
purchase
of
services
contract.
as
judge
hastie,
dissenting
below
said,
nevertheless
and
i
quote
“the
state
buys
no
services
and
the
school
sells
none.
there
are
no
new
children
involved,
there
is
no
new
teaching”.
the
pedagogical
status
quo
in
pennsylvania
is
precisely
the
same
as
it
was
before
the
act,
the
only
difference
is
economic.
the
act
provides
for
considerable
new
state
regulations
of
the
schools,
the
non
public
schools
and
when
i
say
non
public,
it’s
to
be
understood
of
course
that,
these
are
largely
church
affiliated
schools,
97%.
and
97%
of
that,
97%
is
roman
catholic.
the
act
calls
for
inspection
of
textbooks
for
testing
the
pupils
and
for
certain
levels
of
performance
and
that’s
new,
for
the
certification
of
teachers
after
a
passage
of
time
and
that’s
new.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
no
sir,
they
are
submitted.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes
sir.
for
auditing
procedures
and
for
regulating
of
teaching
content
and
those
provisions
of
the
act
are
in
the
record
at
page
20,
20
to
24.
there
were
17.5
million
under
the
act
this
year,
first
year
was
five
and
that’s
in
the
record
but
since
then,
17.5
million.
now
the
complaint
alleged
particular
violations
of
the
establishment
and
freedom
of
exercise
clause
and
there
was
no
question
raised
about
its
adequacy
as
a
pleading.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
they
had
like
on
a
form,
your
honor,
that
says
that
the
cost
for
teacher
salaries,
for
teaching
materials
and
for
textbooks
was
such
and
such
for
teaching
let’s
say
mathematics
and
then
they
submit
that
to
the
state
and
the
state
pays
them
the
money.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
oh
yes
there’s
an
order,
there's
an
order
of
whether
or
not—
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
see
we
don’t
know
your
honor,
we
have
no
record.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
we
can
only
glean
this
from
the
statute
because
there's
no
record
so
we
never
found
put
how
the
state
goes
about
these
procedures,
the
crown
of
my
appeal
is
that
there
should
have
been
--
after
all
i'm
here
on
an
appeal
from
a
motion
to
dismiss,
the
granting
of
motion
to
dismiss
and
i
will
be
unable
to
inform
you
about
a
number
of
things
because
there
isn’t
any
record.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
sir,
a
motion
was
made
to
dismiss
the
complaint
for
fair
and
a
steady
clause
of
action
for
a
lack
of
a
substantial
federal
question.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
no
sir
and
unlike
allen,
it’s
not
an
allen
situation
where
both
sides
cross
move
for
summary
judgment
after
answering
and
nothing
happened
in
this
case
except
the
complaint
was
filed
and
the
complaint
was
dismissed
on
motion
but
one
justice
descending.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes
sir,
they
owe
the
money.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
well
no
because
that
depends
on
how
much
is
available
and
now
the
first
year,
there
was
only
4
million
so
that
was
a
pro-rata.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
well
horse
raising
and
now
cigarette
tax.
it's
17.5
and
i
understand
schedule
mr.
shane
creamer
can
tell
you
this.
i
understand
it
will
certainly
go
to
38
million
in
the
forthcoming
year,
although
on
sunday
night
at
midnight,
the
state
of
pennsylvania,
officially
went
bankrupt
according
to
the
governor
and
so
all
of
these
bills
are
probably
in
limbo.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
no
sir,
may
it
please
the
court,
act
109
is
pennsylvania’s
assessment
bill.
after
200
years,
the
pennsylvania
assembly
attempts
what
the
virginia
assembly
attempted
and
which
madison
and
jefferson
deferred
the
similarities
were
striking.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes
sir
but
you
can
facially
declare
it
unconstitutional,
i
do
want
to
address
myself
to
that,
for
several
grounds
on
which
this
court
could
find
it
facially
unconstitutional.
cases,
of
course
here
your
honor,
it
must
be
realistic
and
valid,
it's
—
it
presents
problems
on
many
levels,
there
is
the
legal
level,
the
traditional
level.
this
little
question
that
the
traditional
church
state
doctrine
is
evolved
by
this
court
would
appear
to
require
the
invalidation
of
this
act.
i
discern
eight
grounds
on
which
church
cases
have
been
founded
by
this
court
and
i
venture
to
say
this
is
the
first
piece
of
legislation
ever
before
this
court
didn’t
violate
all
eight
and
i’ll
come
to
that
in
a
moment
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
the
court
below
thought
not
that
question
was
raised,
it’s
tax
money
and
one
of
my
plaintiffs
went
to
the
horse
race
and
paid
the
tax
and
he
was
the
only
one
found
to
have
admission,
i
think
the
court
ruled
on
that,
i
think
a
tax
is
a
tax
and
public
money
is
public
money
for
this
purpose.
there
might
be
other
cases
where
you
a
great
deal
question
what
the
source
is.
but
when
you
get
to
the
fundamentals
of
the
first
amendment,
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
think
public
money
is
public
money,
makes
no
difference
whether
it's
a
special
tax,
you
can't
isolate
it.
when
there's
only
there
to
read
to
skim
of
the
briefs
here
to
become
aware
your
honors
and
it's
certainly
true
that
the
controversy
here
is
pregnant
with
other
issues.
the
appellees
say
in
their
brief
and
as
they
said
it
at
harrisburg
that
unless
relief
and
unless
subsidy
is
forthcoming,
the
parochial
school
system
will
wither
and
decline.
on
the
other
hand,
the
attackers
of
the
bill
point
out
at
a
different
level
that
the
effectiveness
will
be
to
perpetuate
the
effect
of
racial
segregation
that’s
exemplified
by
the
non-public
school
system.
on
still
another
level,
the
proponents
say,
having
predicted
the
demise
of
the
non-public
school
system
that
the
resulting
exclusively
public
system
will
be
deleterious
to
pluralistic
society
and
we
rejoin,
i
suppose
that
what
you're
heading
for
here
is
a
dual
school
system,
it's
act
is
sustained,
the
one
primarily
affluent
and
suburban
and
white
and
at
least
typically
white
and
suburban
and
elitist
and
the
other
poor,
inferior,
practically
custodial
and
black.
and
that
there
are
nations
that
have
those
systems
and
this
is
what
we’re
heading
for.
if
we’re
talking
simply
about
the
traditional
doctrine,
there's
no
precedent
of
course,
because
there's
no
present
legislation,
the
cases
after
shemport
(ph)
discussed.
they
lead,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
conclusion
that
unless
the
law
is
to
be
changed,
the
stack
must
go
down.
i
do
want
to
mention
bradfield,
however
since
it's
come
up,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
first
of
all
yesterday.
now
bradfield
as
a
precedent
i
think,
your
honor.
i'm
not
speaking
about
the
situation
of
bradfield
because
i’ll
talk
about
that
too.
as
a
precedent,
i
think
bradfield
doesn’t
need
to
troubles
because
rightly
or
wrongly,
and
i
have
a
footnote
which
covers
bradfield
in
my
brief
at
some
length
on
page
19
and
there,
the
supreme
court
rightly
or
wrongly
just
didn’t
reach
the
first
amendment
issue
because
they
simply
said,
the
fact
that
this
corporation,
a
hospital
corporation’s
members
are
composed
of
religious
people
and
they
happen
to
be
catholics,
doesn’t
make
it
sectarian
any
more
than
it
would
if
they
were
methodists
and
they
concluded,
finally
we
are
not
able
to
say
and
i'm
quoting,
“we
are
not
able
to
say
that
the
compliant
in
this
bill
shows
that
the
corporation
is
for
the
kind
described
but
on
the
contrary,
he
has
clearly
shown
it
is
not.
now,
that
doesn’t
get
us
away
from
the
question
and
the
question
is
how
about
hospitals?
because
hospitals
are
in
a
relationship
with
the
state
and
that’s
true
in
pennsylvania
today.
they
are
paid
so
much
for
them
or
indigent
patients
selected
by
the
state
and
sent
to
them
for
treatment.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes
sir
but
not
if
they're
sectarian.
not
if
they're
sectarian,
that’s
my
understanding
and
here
again
we’re
without
a
record
so
your
honor
has
asked
me,
i
was
on
the
board
of
this
group
of
hospital
in
philadelphia
and
we
added
not
(inaudible)
of
the
board,
we
did
a
number
of
things
of
that
kind,
we
did
attach
ourself
for
all
relationship
with
the
archdiocese
in
order
to
get
hill-burton
funds.
now,
i
think
that’s
what
happens
in
the
hospital
cases.
i'm
speaking
of
the
kind
of
thing
that
might
be
analogous
to
our
situation,
that
as
you
treat
a
patient
and
you
get
paid
so
much.
my
rationale
is
this,
and
these
are
the
differences
and
i
think
they
probably
all
have
to
exist
for
the
hospital
situation
to
prevail
constitutionally.
first
of
all,
to
recognize
that
it
is
not
a
church
and
the
care
of
the
sick
is
not
a
mandated,
a
mandated
religious
function,
it’s
part
of
the
good
work
ethics
of
most
all
religions.
it
doesn’t
therefore
teach
or
proselytize,
it
does
not
prefer,
i
don’t
think
exclusion
is
necessary,
i
think
any
distinct
preference
is
sufficient
to
make
it
unconstitutional
and
finally,
and
most
important,
this
is
true
purchase
of
services.
here
the
purchase
of
service
is
not
a
subterfuge,
here
the
status
quo
is
not
the
same
after
as
before
because
new,
specific
individuals
who
are
discernible
and
could
be
tracked
or
treated
who
would
not
be
treated
if
they
were
not
for
the
use
of
this
facility.
so
i
think
all
of
those
differences
are
important
to
the
situation
and
i
don’t,
for
one
minute
agree
if
mr.
pfeffer
did,
i'm
not
quite
sure
he
did
that
the
state
can
subsidize
a
church
to
carry
out
a
secular
function.
i
think
it
can
only
do
that
zorach
v.
clausonunder
very
special
circumstances
and
the
hospital
one
is
one
of
the
very
few
that
i
can—
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes
i
think
the
mere
maintenance
--
all
of
these
other
qualification
is
present,
the
mere
maintenance
of
a
chapel
somewhere
on
the
premises
would
not
be
sufficient
but
i
think
if
somebody
said
that
i
don’t
think
you
can
be
made
to
go
through
the
chapel
either
on
your
way
to
be
cured
or
in
thanks
for
having
been
cured
on
your
way
out.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
your
honor
i
think
you
keep
adding
things
and
finally
we
will
get
to
the
point.
by
itself,
i
would
say
no,
not
if
there's
not
any
opportunity
of
the
charitable
patients
in
any
way,
the
mere
availability
of
the
staff,
i
would
say
no.
but
i
think
you
can
keep
adding
until
it
begins
to
be
a
permeation
of
the
curing
function
with
the
religious
function.
now
i
do
want
to
mention
allen
because
the
briefs
in
allen,
all
the
briefs
in
allen
misstate
allen’s
facts
and
i
must
say
that
--
i
have
to
say
that
that
misstatement
is
based
on
a
misapprehension,
i
think
of
allen’s
facts
in
the
walz
opinion.
i'm
referring
to
the
--
it
is
alleged
that
the
court
in
allen
sustained
a
new
york
book
law
even
though
the
affect
was
to
relieve
the
schools
of
quote,
walz
said,
“the
enormous
aggregate
cost
for
those
books”.
now
actually,
the
footnote
in
the
allen
case,
footnote
6
makes
it
clear
that
the
parents
previously
bought
the
books,
not
the
schools
so
that
there
was
no
relieving
of
the
burden
previous,
that
the
school
previously
had
carried.
now
there's
another
point
in
allen,
factual
point
that
i
haven’t
seen
coming
as
the
one
at
all
and
that
is
this
--
that
prior
to
the
1965
amendment
in
new
york,
the
state
didn’t
pay
for
public
school
children’s
books.
they
could
be
paid
for
by
a
special
provision,
703
with
a
local
tax.
but
you
see,
that
means
that
there,
the
new
york
legislature
was
conferring
a
benefit
namely
free
books
on
all
children
that
had
not
previously
existed.
it
is
quite
clear,
you'll
see
that
in
a
footnote
in
the
allen
case
at
the
very
beginning
in
justice
white’s
opinion
that
until
1965,
and
i'm
quoting
from
the
second
paragraph,
the
state
purchased
books
and
so
and
so
to
rent
or
sell
the
books
to
the
public
school
children.
and
now
therefore,
the
preamble
there
that
they
were
doing
--
standard
for
education
took
on
some
plausibility
and
they
were
supplying
to
all
children
something
they
didn’t
have
before
and
indeed,
could
this
court
have
said
in
allen
that
the
new
york
statute
was
unconstitutional
unless
in
the
process
of
giving
books
to
all
children,
the
new
york
legislature
had
said
but
catholic
children
can't
have
them?
now
the
analogy
in
pennsylvania,
you
see
would
be
if
pennsylvania
in
order
to
fulfill
a
lack
of
teaching
in
mathematics
and
the
physical
sciences,
etcetera,
a
lack
of
teaching
had
set
up
somewhere
either
tutoring
or
some
facilities
that
teach
these
four
subjects.
and
then
you
have
that
kind
of
situation
and
then
would
we
come
in
and
say,
well
the
pennsylvania
act
is
unconstitutional
because
it
doesn’t
exclude
catholic
children
from
these
facilities
but
of
course
nothing
like
that
happened.
now
in
that
sense,
allen
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
teach
them
free?
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
that’s
a
hypothetical
situation,
your
honor
that
i
would
think
would
be
constitutional.
i
think
you
could
offer
--
the
state
can
offer
free
education
to
anybody
even
if
the
free
education
includes
education
as
to
how
to
educate
in
the
catholic
school.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
i
see
a
lot
of
problems
with
that
kind
of
legislation
your
honor
and
of
course
it
talked
about,
i
don’t
know
how
this
court
would
resolve
that
problem,
i
think
it's
difficult,
there's
entanglement
there,
there's
a
really
involvement
problems.
i
really
am
not
trying
to
evade
it.
i
thought
about
it
and
i'm
not
at
all
sure,
your
honor
how
i
could
brief
that
question
to
this
court,
i
think
it's
a
very,
very
close
case.
it
certainly
is
not
this
one.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes
sir,
voucher
kind
of
plan,
i
think
presents
problems
but
with
there
i
think
i
can
say
with
confidence
that
the
constitutional
magnitude
of
the
problems
in
the
voucher
plan
are
pale
and
insignificant
as
compared
with
this
pennsylvania
situation.
i
want
to
mention
just
this
about
walz,
walz
certainly
made
one
important
negative
point.
quite
clearly,
walz
refused
to
validate
the
exemption
there
on
the
ground
that
churches,
by
good
works,
by
welfare
and
charitable
works,
perform
a
secular
function
which
otherwise
were
have
to
be
performed
with
public
expense.
the
chief
justice
clearly
renounced,
speaking
for
the
court,
clearly
renounced
that
rationale.
that
seems
to
me
to
pretty
well
jeopardize
the
argument
of
the
appellees
that
the
main
reason
of
this
is
constitutional
is
because
this
is
a
secular
function
and
that
the
fact
is
being
performed
by
a
church
makes
no
difference.
the
other
important
thing
is
the
concept
in
walz
--
both
interdependence
and
entanglement.
i
think
they
are
somewhat
different.
here
in
the
interdependence,
is
on
the
face
of
this
act.
the
legislature
has
said,
we
are
now
dependent
on
the
church
school
system
to
carry
out
our
mandated
constitutional
duty
of
educating
children
and
in
the
brief
filed
here,
the
church
has
now
said,
we
are
dependent
upon
the
state
subsidy
to
carry
out
our
church
mandated
function
of
educating
adherence
to
our
faith.
as
to
entanglement,
and
i
think
the
very
core
of
walz
was
entanglement
because
it
seems
quite
clear
that
that
it
was
the
concern
of
the
court
that
taxation
would
mean
more
entanglement
than
exemption.
as
to
entanglement,
this
act
has
a
great
deal
of
it,
far
more
than
i
think
any
of
the
other
legislation
involved
in
this
series
of
cases.
not
only
these
inspections
and
these
teacher
gradings
and
all
of
those
new
rules
but
very,
very
important,
section
iii
(iii)
of
the
act
109
forbids,
“any
subject
matter
expressing
religious
teaching
or
the
morals
or
forms
of
worship
of
any
sect,”
to
enter
into
the
teaching
of
these
subjects.
now
does
this
not
require
the
state
to
conduct
a
very
continuing
surveillance
to
use
the
chief
justice’s
words
which
the
chief
justice
said
was
the
very
hallmark
of
entanglement,
impermissible
entanglement.
now,
we
don't
charger
there's
going
to
be
a
wholesale
evasion
of
this
by
let's
say
the
catholic
schools
but
we
do
say
that
it's
only
an
arch
secularist
who
would
insist
on
the
immutable
secularity
of
any
subject,
particularly
something
like
physical
science.
i
mean
after
all
it
was
astronomy
and
not
theology
that
got
galileo
in
trouble,
and
the
physical
science
is
all
upfront,
it
seems
to
me
with
the
temptation
and
likelihood.
in
fact,
i
think
that
we
could
prove
if
we
had
discovered
that
a
cleric
should
not
and
ought
not
to
teach
astronomy
without
making
it
god-oriented
in
a
religious
school.
now,
i
think
the
state
has
got
to
therefore
police
this,
and
i
don’t
think
that
any
gumshoe
from
the
department
of
education
should
be
lurking
around
to
see
if
sister
mary
is
using
the
bible
in
french
to
teach
the
french
language
instead
of
voltaire.
i
think
it's
unconstitutional,
i
guess
the
worst
kind
of
entanglement
with
vengeance.
now
as
to
the
purpose
and
effect
test,
of
course,
the
district
court
ignored
the
fact
because
we
had
no
record.
as
purpose,
they
took
the
act’s
preamble,
they
took
the
act’s
self-serving
declarations
of
secularity,
they
refused
to
look—
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
i
think
there
are
separate
tests.
well,
there
are
two
aspects
to
one
of
the
tests
i
think
they
could
be
separate,
yes
because,
i
think
as
it
was
articulated
both
by
chief
justice
warren
in
mcgowan
and
by
your
honor
in
your
concurring
opinion
in
schempp
that
both
requirements
had
to
be
satisfied,
therefore
in
that
sense
they
could
be
separate
because
if
either
the
primary
effect.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes
sir.
i
think
they
can
be
separate.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
you
think
you
did
not
separate
between
purpose
and
effect,
there’s
two
tests.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
well
i
think
your
honor,
i
really
think
that
all
of
these
tests
and
i
think
there
are
eight
threads,
are
a
seamless
web.
i
think
everyone
affects
every
other
one
fascinatingly
enough
every
single
one
can
be
found
on
the
memorial
and
remonstrants.
not
one
single
one
of
the
tests
that
the
courts
uses,
i
do
not
find
somewhere
in
the
language
of
that
document.
but
as
the
purpose,
the
district
court
simply
refused
to
look
at
the
legislative
history
and
this
is
official
legislative
history
because
pennsylvania
prints
it
all
apparently
on
the
mistaken
notion
that
i
was
trying
to
get
them
to
examine
into
the
motives
of
the
legislator.
well
i
wasn’t
getting
into
the
motives,
i
was
talking
about
the
committee
reports
and
the
full
legislative
history
and
the
significance
is
this.
the
appellees
say
the
purpose
here
is
to
provide
children
in
pennsylvania
with
instruction
in
these
four
subjects
as
the
preamble
said.
well,
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history,
you’ll
find
that
nobody
ever
suggested
there
was
any
such
problem.
nobody
ever
suggested
there
were
any
children
in
pennsylvania
than
not
being
instructed
in
these
subjects.
if
that
had
been
the
search,
the
committee
would
have
explored
presumably
for
alternative
means
of
teaching
these
subjects.
what
they
explored
was
all
of
the
ordinate
means
of
giving
aid
to
the
parochial
schools
from
shared
time
and
all
the
way
through
to
this
device
which
they
finally
adopted.
it
means,
it
seems
to
me
there’s
only
one
question
and
that’s
whether
or
not
the
supposed
exigencies,
economic
exigencies
of
the
subject,
the
overwhelming
sociological
considerations
are
such
as
to
persuade
this
court
to
assure
strict
construction
in
submission
to
what
is
said
to
be
the
practical
realities.
and
you're
asked
to
do
this
by
the
way
without
a
record.
now
there's
been
a
contention
of
fact
made
here
and
that
is
that
if
the
aid
isn’t
forthcoming,
this
school
system
will
wither
and
die.
i
don’t
think
it's
relevant,
if
it
is
relevant,
it
must
be
pleaded,
it
must
be
proved
and
i'm
entitled
certainly
to
extensive
discovery
on
the
question
because
here
the
appellees
in
effect
are
asking
this
court
to
take
judicial
notice
of
a
point
of
economics
and
sociology
about
their
school
system
which
by
the
way
the
known
statistical
data
is
on
which
it's
quite
equivalent
with
this
point,
you
know
we’re
having
a
decline
in
all
schools
at
that
level.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
the
simple
finding
was
that
there's
a
financial
crisis,
that’s
all.
and
of
course
i
know
of
no
institution
and
our
society
except
perhaps
the
military
that
isn’t
in
a
financial
crisis
and
i
assure
that
the
schools
are
--
the
public
schools
are
in
a
financial
crisis
and
i
accept
that
but
there’s
no
finding
in
the
sense
that
so
many
schools,
this
and
the
closing
there
have
been
consolidations.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
in
my
view,
your
honor,
it
doesn’t
bear
at
all
and
there's
no
doctrine
that
says
that
if
something
is
more
expensive,
to
be
done
constitutionally,
that’s
a
grounds
for
doing
it
unconstitutionally.
but
we
cannot
be
unaware
your
honor
with
a
massive
amicus
briefs
that
this
issue
has
certainly
upturned
itself
very
much
into
this
case
then
is
raised
by
the
appellees
in
the
brief
in
this
court
and
it's
there
and
they
say
it's
there.
i'm
skeptical
as
to
agree
that
it's
there
and
i’d
like
to
have
discovery
on
the
question
before
a
vast
principle
of
constitutional
law
is
asked
to
be
decided
by
this
court
on
the
supposition
that
there
is
this
kind
of
practical
problem.
and
to
speak
very
candidly,
raised
by
a
church
where
the
figures
would
show
that
the
capital
of
assets
of
the
church
vastly
exceed
that
of
every
other
denomination
in
the
united
states
combined.
and
i
don’t,
for
one
believe
that
because
of
financial
difficulty
that
the
catholic
church
is
going
to
give
up
a
mandated
function
for
which
they
fought
and
indeed
in
philadelphia
in
1941
died
for
the
principle
in
the
condition
of
affluence
in
which
everyone
in
society
now
finds
themselves.
now,
i
must
get
on
if
i
may
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
point,
there
the
court
said
no
standing,
in
any
of
my
plaintiffs,
the
charge
was
that
the
non-public
schools
or
de
facto
racially
segregated
rather
by
reason
of
policy
or
tradition
or
practice
or
cost
or
residential
pattern
that
they
are.
but
basically
it's
a
white
school
system,
the
figures
that
are
available
from
public
sources
are
in
the
brief.
again
we
have
no
record.
the
idea
is
this,
that
with
this
amount
of
tax
money
going
to
these
schools,
they
are
sufficiently
quasi
public
so
that
if
they
discriminate
and
segregate
that
is
state
action
reachable
by
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
as
for
standing,
i
think
it's
a
case
where
to
find
out
whether
or
not
mr.
lemon,
who
is
a
negro
parent
with
negro
children
in
the
public
school
than
who
alleges
in
his
complaint
a
deleterious
effect
upon
his
children’s
schools
by
reason
of
the
subsidy
to
the
others,
whether
he
has
a
sufficient
personal
stake
in
the
outcome
which
has
been
the
touchstone
of
standing
in
these
matters,
he
is
a
taxpayer,
would
be
illuminated
by
discovery.
i
think
the
two
are
interchangeable
because
it
may
depend
indeed
on
how
pervasive
the
segregation
is
and
how
much
discrimination
there
is,
and
we
can't
find
out
any
of
that
without
discovery
in
the
matter.
now
i
mentioned,
--
well
one
point
more
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
point,
mr.
douglas,
not
so
long
ago
said
this
in
jones
against
mayer
said
the
contrivances
with
some
states
have
concocted
to
afford
to
command
of
our
decision
in
brown
versus
board
of
education
are
by
now
legendary.
now,
i
for
one
can't,
(inaudible)
how
if
you
validate
a
purchase
of
services
contracts
scheme
where
in
fact,
no
new
educational
benefit
is
being
conferred,
it's
merely
a
method
of
channeling
funds,
how
that
device
is
not
going
to
be
available
to
the
formerly,
they
adjure
state
still
resisting
brown
v.
board
of
education.
maybe
that’s
possible
to
cut
it.
i
for
one
would
think
difficult.
now
i
said
in
the
beginning
that
i
thought
there
were
eight
tests
used
by
the
court
and
that
this
act
violated
all
of
them,
just
in
a
sentence,
first
of
all
the
general
flat
principle
no
tax
money
to
churches
coming
down
from
the
memorial
or
remonstrants
might
stay
through
the
language
of
many,
many
of
these
cases
and
that’s
on
the
face
of
the
act.
then
the
primary
purpose,
if
that’s
one
and
primary
effect,
primary
purpose,
it
seems
clear
from
legislative
history,
primary
effect,
we
do
need
discovery,
i
think
one
can
discern
that
there
is
some
primary
effect.
then
the
concept
of
sponsorship
which
was
in
mccollum,
it
was
certainly
an
angle,
mr.
justice
brennan
distinguished
the
zorach
v.
clauson
situation
from
the
mccollum
situation
on
that
basis,
it
was
in
schempp
that
is
the
state
must
not
sponsor
or
even
appear
to
sponsor
a
religion
which
is
one
of
the
points
of
schempp.
then
preference,
the
fact
that
this
act
manifestly
prefers
one
religion
over
all
others
and
prefers
that
very
most
two
or
three
religions
over
all
others
and
affirmatively
discriminates
against
those
religions
too
poor,
too
scattered
to
even
think
about
running
a
school
system
black
store
front,
mission
type
of
churches
for
instance.
then
interdependence,
and
that’s
on
the
face
of
the
act
because
the
act
says
it's
dependent.
entanglement
and
that’s
shown
by
section
iii
(iii).
excuse
me
your
honor,
i
didn’t
see
the
red
light.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
thank
you
sir,
i
have
just
one
more.
entanglement
and
finally
point
eight,
if
it's
secular,
the
act
nonetheless
does
use
religious
means
to
accomplish
a
secular
end.
and
in
my
research
i
find
no
matter
before
this
court
in
which
all
aid
of
those
tests
would
appear
and
some
facially,
three
facially
to
be
violated
by
the
pennsylvania
act,
and
thank
you
for
your
indulgence
your
honor.
