mr.
edward
bennett
williams
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i’d
like
to
take
just
few
a
moments
if
i
may
and
say
a
word
about
the
statutory
scheme
that
is
under
scrutiny
here
in
this
decision.
rhode
island
made
the
judgment
some
years
ago
as
did
the
federal
government
that
it
was
difficult
to
get
quality
teachers
for
the
elementary
school
grades.
and
so,
it
enacted
a
law
granting
a
subsidy
or
a
bonus
to
teachers
in
the
elementary
public
schools
of
the
state
of
rhode
island.
it
gave
that
bonus
directly
to
the
teacher.
subsequently,
in
1960,
it
escalated
that
bonus
to
30%
of
the
supplement,
but
it
immersed
it
in
other
kids
of
aid
that
it
provided
to
the
cities
and
towns
of
the
state
of
rhode
island.
it
picked
up
30%
of
the
cost
of
elementary
school
education
at
the
public
school
level
in
rhode
island.
when
this
statute
was
passed
in
1969,
what
the
state
legislature
was
doing
was
simply,
including
within
the
penumbra
of
the
general
welfare
statute
applicable
to
elementary
school
teachers
in
the
state
of
rhode
island,
those
teachers
who
were
in
the
nonpublic
nonprofit
schools.
now
there
are
98
parochial
schools
in
the
state
of
rhode
island.
there
are
about
1000
parochial
school
teachers,
the
record
shows.
there
are
about
1076
teachers
in
non-parochial,
nonpublic
or
independent
private
schools.
how
many
of
those
teachers
are
eligible
and
qualified
and
how
many
have
been
declared
eligible
and
have
qualified
under
this
act,
only
161.
why?
--
because
the
act
is
so
tailored
as
to
exclude
those
independent
schools
whose
per
pupil
expenditure
exceeds
that
of
the
public
schools
of
the
state
of
rhode
island
because
indeed,
they
don’t
need
that
kind
of
aid.
now,
how
many
of
the
parochial
school
teachers
are
qualified
for
this
kind
of
aid,
342
the
record
shows.
because
the
balance
of
them
are
nuns
and
nuns
don’t
qualify
under
this
because
the
statute
requires
that
the
teacher
receive
the
minimum
standard
applicable
to
the
public
schools
system
before
a
teacher
can
qualify
for
the
aid.
and
the
statutes
of
rhode
island
show
us
that
$4000.00
is
the
minimum
salary
paid
to
a
public
school
teacher
in
the
state
of
rhode
island.
and
the
record
shows
us
that
the
nuns
who
teach
in
the
parochial
schools
of
the
state
of
rhode
island
receive
$1800.00
a
year
if
they
have
a
bachelors
degree
and
$1,900.00
a
year
if
they
have
a
master’s
degree.
so
we
come
down
to
161
teachers
receiving
a
supplement
of
15%
of
the
salary
that’s
given
to
them.
what
effect
did
this
have?
in
1968,
the
parochial
schools
of
the
state
of
rhode
island
were
able
to
offer,
the
record
shows,
$5,000.00
as
a
starting
salary
to
the
teachers.
while
the
public
schools
were
offering
$6,000.00.
by
virtue
of
the
salary
supplement
here
it
provided
for,
the
parochial
school
could
offer
$6000.00
by
raising
it’s
contribution
from
5
to
5100
and
the
state
would
then
contribute
$900.00
directly
to
the
teacher
under
some
very
sharply
defined
and
circumscribed
conditions.
number
one,
that
the
teacher
did
not
teach
religion.
number
two,
that
the
teacher
was
certified
by
the
state
of
rhode
island.
number
three,
that
the
teacher
used
only
those
materials
and
textbooks
used
in
the
public
schools
for
subjects
being
taught
and
required
to
be
taught
in
the
public
schools
at
rhode
island.
number
five,
that
the
teacher
received
a
minimum
salary
provided
for
in
the
public
schools
of
rhode
island.
and
number
six,
that
the
salary
plus
the
supplement
not
equal
or
exceed,
not
exceed,
the
maximum
average
for
the
public
school
counterpart
teacher.
that’s
what
this
act
did.
in
other
words,
it
provided
to
certain
teachers
under
carefully
circumscribed
conditions,
a
possible
parity
of
income
for
teaching
the
same
subjects
with
the
same
materials,
with
the
same
certifications
in
nonpublic
schools,
substandard
public
schools
because
their
per
pupil
expenditure
was
below
the
public
school
expenditure.
now,
if
the
court
please,
what
did
the
lower
court
say
with
respect
to
this
act?
because
i
submit
to
the
court
that
statutory
scheme
here
in
the
state
of
rhode
island
is
no
different
from
a
situation
where
the
state
would
offer
$500.00
grant
or
an
$800.00
grant
to
all
the
elementary
school
teachers
across
the
board
in
nonprofit
schools
so
long
as
they
did
not
teach
religion.
i
don’t
think
that
kind
of
statute
would
be
subject
successfully
to
constitutional
attack
under
the
test
that
has
been
laid
down
here.
that’s
precisely
what
was
done
here.
what
do
the
lower
court
say.
it
purported
to
apply
the
purpose
and
primary
effect
test.
and
what
it
did
say
about
the
purpose,
it
said
the
first
part
of
this
test
determining
the
statute's
purpose
presents
little
difficulty.
the
salary
supplement
act
in
our
opinion
was
not
intended
to
advance
or
interfere
with
religion.
the
statute
resides
that
its
purpose
is
to
provide
quality
education
for
all
rhode
island
youth,
those
in
public
and
nonpublic
schools,
the
quality
of
education
in
the
nonpublic
schools
are
legitimate
legislative
concern.
we
find
nothing
in
the
history
and
the
structure
of
the
act
which
suggests
that
the
legislative
purpose
was
other
than
as
declared.
it
then
goes
on
to
say
that
it’s
certainly
fulfills
a
secular
purpose
for
the
statute
to
have
been
limited
to
teachers
in
schools
who’s
per-pupil
expenditure
does
not
equal
or
exceed
the
public
expenditure
because
it
that
way,
this
aid
is
directed
to
teachers
who
are
teaching
in
substandard
economic
schools
which
cannot
afford
to
pay
them
on
a
parity
for
the
same
services
with
the
public
schools
in
the
state.
now
what
does
it
say
about
the
purpose?
and
this
is
where
we
submit
the
lower
court
(inaudible).
it
says
this,
it
says,
and
this
is
at
page
37
of
the
joint
appendix.
“on
the
one
hand,
we
find
the
statute
will
have
the
secular
effect
of
aiding
the
quality
of
secular
education
in
the
state
of
rhode
island,
precisely
what
it
was
intended
to
do.
precisely
what
the
purpose
of
a
legislature
was,
it
finds
that
it
did
have
that
effect.
but,
it
goes
on
to
say
on
the
other
hand,
we
think
it
equally
clear
that
the
act
gives
significant
aid
to
a
religious
enterprise.
at
page
40,
it
repeats
and
it
says,
the
second
part
of
the
schempp
test
determining
the
statute's
primary
effect
presents
a
more
difficult
problem
of
definition
and
application.
plaintiffs
have
argued
that
primary
mean
is
essential
or
fundamental.
defendants
and
interveners
have
taken
a
more
literal
position,
claiming
that
primary
means
first
in
order
of
the
importance.
the
problem
of
definition
is
critical
in
this
case
because
we
have
noted
the
act
has
two
significant
effects.
on
the
one
hand,
it
aids
the
quality
of
secular
education.
on
the
other,
it
provides
support
to
a
religious
enterprise.
this
court,
since
it
began
the
evolution
of
the
purpose
and
primary
test
has
found
in
four
instances
that
the
mere
fact
that
an
effect
of
a
statute
may
be
of
aid
or
benefit
to
religion
does
not
constitute
a
barrier
to
its
passing
constitutional
muster.
it
said
it
in
everson.
it
is
said
in
the
mcgowan.
it
said
it
in
allen.
and
it
said
in
walz.
furthermore,
this
court
has
found
that
in
focusing
on
the
nature
of
the
primary
effect,
you
look
at
the
functions
subsidized,
not
the
institution
benefiting.
it
is
said
this
in
everson.
it’s
said
in
mccollum.
it’s
said
it
in
allen
and
it
found
both
in
pierce
against
the
society
of
sisters.
43
years
ago
and
in
board
of
education
against
allen,
three
years
ago
that
these
schools
do
provide
a
secular
function.
now,
what
would
be
the
effect,
what
would
be
the
effect
of
following
the
lower
court’s
concept
of
the
primary
effect
test?
it
would
be
as
follows,
we
would
roll
back,
the
law
of
church
and
state
25
years,
if
we
found
that
because
a
secular
statute
that
had
a
secular
set
gave
incidental
aid
to
religion
that
it
failed
to
pass
constitutional
muster
then
we
must
of
necessity
reverse
everson.
we
must
reverse
mcgowan.
we
must
reverse
allen.
and
we
must
reverse
walz.
and
if
we
consider
the
nature
of
the
word
significant,
significant
aid
to
a
secular
enterprise,
then
we
better
focus
on
how
significant
the
aid
is
here.
the
aid
here,
161
teachers
from
98
schools
or
one-and-a-half
teachers
per
school,
receiving
$900.00
salary
supplement
pails
into
insignificance
compared
to
the
significance
of
the
aid
in
everson
in
1947
when
a
whole
school
load
of
children
were
bussed
to
and
from
school.
simple
arithmetic
will
tell
you
that
if
you
are
paid
ten
cents
a
ride
to
take
300
little
boys
and
girls
to
and
from
school
on
a
180
school
days
a
years,
twice
a
day,
you’re
talking
about
$12,000.00
or
$13,000.00.
in
board
of
education
against
allen,
we
talked
about
giving
textbooks
or
lending
textbooks
to
the
children
of
the
new
york
elementary
schools.
if
they
received
their
textbook
in
mathematics,
if
they
received
their
textbook
in
science,
if
they
received
their
textbook
in
a
foreign
language,
then
we
are
talking
about
a
per-pupil
expenditure
or
a
per
school
expenditure
that
dwarfs
the
expenditure
that
is
countenance
in
this
particular
statute.
so,
i
suggest
that
when
the
court
strikes
down
the
rhode
island
statute
as
failing
to
pass
the
primary
test
facet
of
the
test
fashioned
by
this
court,
because
it
is
giving
significant
aid
to
the
schools,
it
is
running
counter
to
the
whole
train
of
decisions
of
this
court.
now,
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
they
couldn’t
be
mr.
justice
because
the
record
shows
they
make
$1800.00
a
year.
obviously,
if
the
school
as
the
record
shows
couldn’t
afford
to
pay
an
extra
thousand
dollars
to
get
quality
lay
teachers,
it
couldn’t
afford
to
escalate
the
nuns
from
$1800.00
to
$4,000.00
a
year,
when
there
were
seven
or
eight
nuns
teaching
in
these
schools
and
one
or
two
layman.
so
that
the
nuns,
practically,
as
the
record
shows,
absolutely
cannot
qualify
for
this
aid,
the
record
does
show
if
the
court
please,
that
one
nun
did
and
she
qualified
because
her
mother
was
dying,
she
had
to
leave
the
order,
she
had
to
go
out
and
earn
money
to
support
her
mother
and
live
outside
of
the
convent.
and
she
made
application
because
she
was
teaching
a
holy
secular
subject.
but
other
than
that,
there
is
no
qualification
of
religious
under
the
statute,
only
342
lay
teachers
qualified
of
whom
only
161
came
forward,
because
indeed,
the
teacher
may
not
come
forward
and
ask
for
the
supplement
unless
the
school
qualifies
by
filing
what
is
known
as
an
nps
nonpublic
school
form
31,
showing
that
its
per-pupil
expenditure
is
less
than
the
per-pupil
expenditure
at
the
public
school
so
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
for
the
secular
education.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
(voice
overlap).
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
depends
upon
the
order
to
which
they
belong.
i
think
some
nuns
do
take
the
bow
of
poverty
and
i
think
some
do
not.
i
think
it’s
entirely
a
question
of
the
order
to
which
they
adhere.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
guess,
$1,800.00
probably
as
just
walking
around
money
at
these
days
mr.
justice
[laughter]
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
i
think
that
they
are
allowed
to
leave
the
convent
but
i
don’t
think
they
can
go
very
far
at
$1,800.00
at
these
--
[laughter],
but
that’s
the
maximum
that
they’re
paid
under
the
rhode
island
school
system.
and
they
get
$1,900.00
if
they
have
a
master’s
degree.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
that
this
was
expressed
and
articulated
clearly,
perhaps
for
the
first
time
in
walz
against
the
tax
commission.
and
the
question
then
becomes,
because
this
is
the
caveat
of
walz
as
i
read
it.
it
does
not
abrogate
the
purpose
and
primary
effect
test
at
all.
it
simply
adds
a
caveat
to
the
primary
effect
test,
the
purpose
and
primary
effect
test.
and
it
says
if
the
program,
if
the
statute
creates
an
excessive
entanglement
between
church
and
religion,
then
the
statute
must
fail.
and
then
the
court
made
a
calculated
choice
between
the
exemption
of
the
ad
valorem
tax
for
churches
and
the
imposition
of
the
ad
valorem
tax
for
churches
and
found
that
there
was
a
lesser
degree
of
involvement
resulting
from
the
exemption
than
from
the
imposition
looking
down
the
road
and
apparently
shunning
the
prospect
of
foreclosing
on
a
church.
i
suggest,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
same
rationale
holds
here,
because
this
court
in
discussing
this
problem
had
this
to
say,
it
said
“if
the
quality
of
teaching,”
this
is
at
page
37
of
the
record,
“falls
too
low,
then
not
only
will
catholic
parents
be
reluctant
to
enroll
their
children,
but
the
parochial
school
will
run
afoul
of
rhode
island’s
education
laws.
50
years
ago,
this
court
said
that
parents
could
satisfy
the
compulsory
school
attendance
laws
of
this
nation
by
sending
their
children
to
these
schools.
the
unspoken
corollary
of
that
of
course
was
that
the
was
that
the
state
had
the
right
to
regulate
the
secular
facet
of
these
schools
and
indeed
they
have.
they’ve
regulated
the
number
of
days
to
which
children
must
go,
they’ve
picked
the
holidays,
they’ve
required
certification
of
the
teachers
and
they
indeed
have
insisted
that
certain
subjects
be
thought,
rhode
island
has
done
the
same.
now
i
say,
if
the
court
please,
that
if
the
state
can
compel
then,
it
may
assist.
and
that’s
what
its
doing
here.
i
say
that
the
degree
of
involvement
between
the
operation
of
these
schools
and
the
compulsory
school
attendance
laws
of
rhode
island
and
the
country
in
fact,
make
the
degree
of
involvement
of
paying
$900.00
to
a
teacher
di
minimus.
i
say
also
that
if
the
legislative
judgement
has
been
made
by
the
state
of
rhode
island,
that
these
schools
cannot
attract
and
hold
qualified
teacher
for
secular
subjects,
without
those
teachers
being
given
a
subsidy,
then,
the
quality
of
secular
education
in
those
schools
is
going
to
fall.
and
when
it
becomes
marginal,
the
ugly
confrontation
which
this
court
eschewed
in
walz
against
the
tax
commission
becomes
a
reality,
because
then,
there
comes
the
kind
of
entanglement,
the
kind
of
excessive
entanglement
that
this
court
expressed
its
abhorrence
for
last
year
in
walz
against
the
tax
commission.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
that
statutes
of
rhode
island
cover
this,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
is
a
statute
called
compulsory
attendance.
it
is
in
title
16,
chapter
19
of
the
rhode
island
general
statutes,
and
this
tells
what
the
state
of
rhode
island
insists
upon
from
all
nonprofit,
nonpublic
schools
if
they
are
to
meet
the
standards
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
suspect
mr.
justice
that
there
is
no
surveillance
on
that
subject.
i
suspect
there
is
none,
but
the
record
is
silent
on
it.
i
don’t
know
of
surveillance
on
that.
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
when
one
of
these
161
teachers
signs
a
statement
applying
for
supplement
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
that’s
correct.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
mr.
justice
which
shows
a
regular
inspection.
i
am
quite
sure
that
if
there
was
a
charge
that
certain
subject
were
not
being
thought
as
demanded
by
the
statutory
scheme
of
the
state
of
rhode
island
or
that
non-qualified,
non-certified
teachers
were
purporting
to
teach
subjects
that
were
required
to
be
thought,
that
there
would
be
appropriate
action
taken
by
rhode
islands’
state
board
of
education.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
for
the
schools?
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir.
that
is
provided
for
in
the
section
to
which
i
referred
to
chief
justice,
chapter
16
title
19,
that
they
must
be
approved
by
the
board
of
education
of
the
township
or
the
city
or
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
to
that
extent
there
is
of
all
nonpublic
schools.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
that’s
another
way
of
expressing
my
thought,
mr.
juctice.
i
say
that
the
degree
of
supervision
required
by
the
salary
supplement
act
is
de
minimus
compared
to
the
supervision
that
is
authorized
and
required
by
the
statute
to
make
sure
that
these
schools
fulfill
the
requirements
of
the
compulsory
school
attendance
laws
of
the
state
of
the
state
of
rhode
island.
and
indeed,
they
have
been
found
these
schools
to
fulfill
less
compulsory
attendance
laws
and
have
provided
a
secular
service
to
the
state
with
the
approval
of
this
court
and
without
challenge
for
some
50
years
since
pierce
against
society
of
sisters.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think,
mr.
justice,
that
the
aid
would
be
greater.
i
don’t
think
the
principles
would
be
different
so
long
as
the
function
being
subsidized
is
secularly
segregable.
i
think
that’s
why
this
court
sits
to
test
that
kind
of
situation
in
the
event
that
it
arises.
i
think
it’s
quite
unlikely
in
the
state
of
rhode
island
that
the
supplement
that
is
granted
to
the
nonpublic,
nonprofit
schools
will
exceed
that
which
is
given
to
the
public
schools,
namely
30%
under
the
existing
statute.
i
would
like
to
reserve
whatever
time
i
have
remaining
for
rebuttal.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i’d
like
to
take
these
few
minutes
to
just
correct
two
impressions
that
have
been
left
with
the
court,
in
the
argument
of
counsel.
mr.
pfeffer
suggested
to
the
court
that
the
superintendent
of
schools,
for
the
parochial
schools
of
rhode
islands,
testified
that
if
the
statute
were
held
unconstitutional,
then
the
money
would
just
continue
to
come
from
the
parish.
the
record
shows
first
of
all,
that
what
the
superintendent
testified
to,
was
that
the
contracts
with
his
teaches
were
signed
after
the
statutes
were
passed.
and
that
because
the
individual
schools
were
bound
by
those
contracts,
they
would
have
to
pay
for
that
year,
the
amount
of
money
called
for
in
the
contract,
because
it
had
been
executed,
but
it
did
not
suggest,
he
did
not
suggest,
he
did
not
say
that
thereafter,
that
the
schools
would
be
able
to
continue
this
higher
stipend.
now,
an
issue
has
been
injected
in
the
last
moments
of
the
arguments
here.
the
suggestion
has
been
made
that
there
are
some
kind
of
exclusion
policy
in
these
schools,
either
racial
or
religious.
and
i
receive
the
(inaudible)
this
morning
from
mr.
pfeffer,
when
he
said
that
i
had
misstated
title
6
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act.
well,
title
6
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act
is
specifically
incorporated
in
the
rhode
island
salary
supplement
statute.
it's
precisely
stated
such
regulations
shall
ensure
that
any
non-public
school,
as
that
term
is
defined
earlier
in
this
chapter,
which
employs
teachers
who
receive
salary
supplements,
as
provided
for
in
this
chapter
shall
comply
with
the
provisions
contained
in
title
6
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
and
the
suggestion
was
made
this
morning
that
there
was
exemption
for
religion.
well,
there
is
an
exemption
for
religion.
there's
a
very
narrow
circumscribed
exemption
for
religious
in
title
42
2008,
section
1,
in
hiring
policies
of
institutions,
where
the
hiring
is
by
a
religious
institution,
for
a
religious
activity,
it
is
so
that
a
religious
school
does
not
have
to
hire
somebody
of
a
different
religion
to
teach
religion,
which
would
have
no
acquisition
to
this
case,
because
religion
teachers
are
excluded
from
the
benefits
of
the
act,
in
any
event.
there
was
no
suggestion
at
any
time,
until
the
veining
hours
of
the
argument
here
in
this
court
that
there
was
ever
any
exclusion
on
the
basis
of
race
from
any
of
these
schools,
never
at
any
time
in
the
lower
court,
and
indeed
the
record
is
diametrically
to
the
contrary,
and
i
invite
the
court
to
read
it.
and
i
suggest
likewise,
there
has
been
no
evidence
produced
in
this
record,
in
the
lower
court,
that
anyone
is
excluded
from
these
school
by
virtue
of
religion
for
indeed
the
record
once
again
is
diametrically
opposite
to
the
suggestion
that
was
made
in
the
closing
moments
of
counsel's
argument.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
page
223
of
the
appendix,
if
the
court
please—
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
counsel
said
that,
that
was
a
stipulation
between
the
parties,
nothing
could
be
farther
from
the
fact,
i
suggest.
if
you
read
the
record
here,
from
pages
120
to
127,
you
will
see
the
long
colloquy
that
went
on,
between
counsel
with
respect
to
the
admission
of
this
handbook
in
evidence.
and
it
was
pointed
out
that
many
sections
of
the
handbook
were
superseded
or
never
operative
and
that
were
never
put
into
practice.
and
the
counsel
met
and
stipulated
with
respect
to
certain
portions
of
the
handbook
and
that
whole
dialog
is
contained
between
120
and
127.
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
there
never
was
an
issue
in
this
case,
there
never
was
an
issue
to
which
this
particular
section
could
be
germane,
because
there
was
no
proof
of
exclusion
on
a
racial
or
religious
grounds.
for
these
reasons,
we
ask
that
this
court
uphold
the
constitutionality
of
the
rhode
island
salary
supplement
act,
as
applied
to
the
teachers
in
the
nonprofit,
nonpublic
schools.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
handbook
was
promulgated
in
1965
mr.
justice
and—
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
and
given
by
the
superintendent
of
schools—
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
parochial
schools
in
rhode
island,
and
given
to
the
principals
of
the
various
schools
and
all
of
the
teachers,
who
testified
in
this
record
were
thoroughly
unfamiliar
with
it,
because
none
of
them
had
either
been
asked
to
follow
it
nor
was
anyone
in
possession
of
it,
nor
was
anyone
in
fact
following.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
he
gave
it
to
the
principals.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
he
gave
it
to
the
principals,
because
i
believe
it
was
an
aspiration
for
the
way
that
he
wished
these
schools
to
operate,
but
in
fact,
they
were
not
operated
and
the
testimony
in
the
record
is
to
fact
that
they
were
not
operated
under
the
sample.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
no,
he
didn’t
give
it
to
teachers
mr.
justice—
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
he
gave
it
only
to
the
principals
of
the
schools.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
he
had
the
power
to
hire
and
discharge.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
and
he
testified
mr.
justice
that
the
handbook
had
been
superseded
by
other
directives,
and
that
it
was
inoperative
and
(voice
overlap).
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
testimony
of
father
mullin
appears
in
the
record
over
many
pages,
beginning
if
the
court
please.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
i
directed
the—
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
directed
the
court’s
attention
to
pages
120
to
127,
where
those
stipulations
were
worked
out.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
at
page
68,
the
superintendent
of
schools
was
asked
about
the
handbook,
is
that
handbook
now
in
effect?
yes
except,
insofar
as
it
has
been
superseded
by
later
directives.
now,
if
the
court
please—
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
pages
120
to
127.
directing
your
attention
mr.
justice
to
page
121,
it
was
stated,
they
will
be
read
in
to
the
record
with
the
understanding
that
if
father
mullin
were
called,
he
would
testify
that
although
they
have
never
been
formally
repealed
or
superseded
by
a
written
document,
nevertheless
they
are
not
now
in
effect
or
not
being
carried
out.
and
then,
they
go
on
to
point
out
the
various
sections,
the
various
paragraphs
and
the
various
subdivisions,
which
have
been
inoperative
or
superseded.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
does
not,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i’d
like
to
take
just
few
a
moments
if
i
may
and
say
a
word
about
the
statutory
scheme
that
is
under
scrutiny
here
in
this
decision.
rhode
island
made
the
judgment
some
years
ago
as
did
the
federal
government
that
it
was
difficult
to
get
quality
teachers
for
the
elementary
school
grades.
and
so,
it
enacted
a
law
granting
a
subsidy
or
a
bonus
to
teachers
in
the
elementary
public
schools
of
the
state
of
rhode
island.
it
gave
that
bonus
directly
to
the
teacher.
subsequently,
in
1960,
it
escalated
that
bonus
to
30%
of
the
supplement,
but
it
immersed
it
in
other
kids
of
aid
that
it
provided
to
the
cities
and
towns
of
the
state
of
rhode
island.
it
picked
up
30%
of
the
cost
of
elementary
school
education
at
the
public
school
level
in
rhode
island.
when
this
statute
was
passed
in
1969,
what
the
state
legislature
was
doing
was
simply,
including
within
the
penumbra
of
the
general
welfare
statute
applicable
to
elementary
school
teachers
in
the
state
of
rhode
island,
those
teachers
who
were
in
the
nonpublic
nonprofit
schools.
now
there
are
98
parochial
schools
in
the
state
of
rhode
island.
there
are
about
1000
parochial
school
teachers,
the
record
shows.
there
are
about
1076
teachers
in
non-parochial,
nonpublic
or
independent
private
schools.
how
many
of
those
teachers
are
eligible
and
qualified
and
how
many
have
been
declared
eligible
and
have
qualified
under
this
act,
only
161.
why?
--
because
the
act
is
so
tailored
as
to
exclude
those
independent
schools
whose
per
pupil
expenditure
exceeds
that
of
the
public
schools
of
the
state
of
rhode
island
because
indeed,
they
don’t
need
that
kind
of
aid.
now,
how
many
of
the
parochial
school
teachers
are
qualified
for
this
kind
of
aid,
342
the
record
shows.
because
the
balance
of
them
are
nuns
and
nuns
don’t
qualify
under
this
because
the
statute
requires
that
the
teacher
receive
the
minimum
standard
applicable
to
the
public
schools
system
before
a
teacher
can
qualify
for
the
aid.
and
the
statutes
of
rhode
island
show
us
that
$4000.00
is
the
minimum
salary
paid
to
a
public
school
teacher
in
the
state
of
rhode
island.
and
the
record
shows
us
that
the
nuns
who
teach
in
the
parochial
schools
of
the
state
of
rhode
island
receive
$1800.00
a
year
if
they
have
a
bachelors
degree
and
$1,900.00
a
year
if
they
have
a
master’s
degree.
so
we
come
down
to
161
teachers
receiving
a
supplement
of
15%
of
the
salary
that’s
given
to
them.
what
effect
did
this
have?
in
1968,
the
parochial
schools
of
the
state
of
rhode
island
were
able
to
offer,
the
record
shows,
$5,000.00
as
a
starting
salary
to
the
teachers.
while
the
public
schools
were
offering
$6,000.00.
by
virtue
of
the
salary
supplement
here
it
provided
for,
the
parochial
school
could
offer
$6000.00
by
raising
it’s
contribution
from
5
to
5100
and
the
state
would
then
contribute
$900.00
directly
to
the
teacher
under
some
very
sharply
defined
and
circumscribed
conditions.
number
one,
that
the
teacher
did
not
teach
religion.
number
two,
that
the
teacher
was
certified
by
the
state
of
rhode
island.
number
three,
that
the
teacher
used
only
those
materials
and
textbooks
used
in
the
public
schools
for
subjects
being
taught
and
required
to
be
taught
in
the
public
schools
at
rhode
island.
number
five,
that
the
teacher
received
a
minimum
salary
provided
for
in
the
public
schools
of
rhode
island.
and
number
six,
that
the
salary
plus
the
supplement
not
equal
or
exceed,
not
exceed,
the
maximum
average
for
the
public
school
counterpart
teacher.
that’s
what
this
act
did.
in
other
words,
it
provided
to
certain
teachers
under
carefully
circumscribed
conditions,
a
possible
parity
of
income
for
teaching
the
same
subjects
with
the
same
materials,
with
the
same
certifications
in
nonpublic
schools,
substandard
public
schools
because
their
per
pupil
expenditure
was
below
the
public
school
expenditure.
now,
if
the
court
please,
what
did
the
lower
court
say
with
respect
to
this
act?
because
i
submit
to
the
court
that
statutory
scheme
here
in
the
state
of
rhode
island
is
no
different
from
a
situation
where
the
state
would
offer
$500.00
grant
or
an
$800.00
grant
to
all
the
elementary
school
teachers
across
the
board
in
nonprofit
schools
so
long
as
they
did
not
teach
religion.
i
don’t
think
that
kind
of
statute
would
be
subject
successfully
to
constitutional
attack
under
the
test
that
has
been
laid
down
here.
that’s
precisely
what
was
done
here.
what
do
the
lower
court
say.
it
purported
to
apply
the
purpose
and
primary
effect
test.
and
what
it
did
say
about
the
purpose,
it
said
the
first
part
of
this
test
determining
the
statute's
purpose
presents
little
difficulty.
the
salary
supplement
act
in
our
opinion
was
not
intended
to
advance
or
interfere
with
religion.
the
statute
resides
that
its
purpose
is
to
provide
quality
education
for
all
rhode
island
youth,
those
in
public
and
nonpublic
schools,
the
quality
of
education
in
the
nonpublic
schools
are
legitimate
legislative
concern.
we
find
nothing
in
the
history
and
the
structure
of
the
act
which
suggests
that
the
legislative
purpose
was
other
than
as
declared.
it
then
goes
on
to
say
that
it’s
certainly
fulfills
a
secular
purpose
for
the
statute
to
have
been
limited
to
teachers
in
schools
who’s
per-pupil
expenditure
does
not
equal
or
exceed
the
public
expenditure
because
it
that
way,
this
aid
is
directed
to
teachers
who
are
teaching
in
substandard
economic
schools
which
cannot
afford
to
pay
them
on
a
parity
for
the
same
services
with
the
public
schools
in
the
state.
now
what
does
it
say
about
the
purpose?
and
this
is
where
we
submit
the
lower
court
(inaudible).
it
says
this,
it
says,
and
this
is
at
page
37
of
the
joint
appendix.
“on
the
one
hand,
we
find
the
statute
will
have
the
secular
effect
of
aiding
the
quality
of
secular
education
in
the
state
of
rhode
island,
precisely
what
it
was
intended
to
do.
precisely
what
the
purpose
of
a
legislature
was,
it
finds
that
it
did
have
that
effect.
but,
it
goes
on
to
say
on
the
other
hand,
we
think
it
equally
clear
that
the
act
gives
significant
aid
to
a
religious
enterprise.
at
page
40,
it
repeats
and
it
says,
the
second
part
of
the
schempp
test
determining
the
statute's
primary
effect
presents
a
more
difficult
problem
of
definition
and
application.
plaintiffs
have
argued
that
primary
mean
is
essential
or
fundamental.
defendants
and
interveners
have
taken
a
more
literal
position,
claiming
that
primary
means
first
in
order
of
the
importance.
the
problem
of
definition
is
critical
in
this
case
because
we
have
noted
the
act
has
two
significant
effects.
on
the
one
hand,
it
aids
the
quality
of
secular
education.
on
the
other,
it
provides
support
to
a
religious
enterprise.
this
court,
since
it
began
the
evolution
of
the
purpose
and
primary
test
has
found
in
four
instances
that
the
mere
fact
that
an
effect
of
a
statute
may
be
of
aid
or
benefit
to
religion
does
not
constitute
a
barrier
to
its
passing
constitutional
muster.
it
said
it
in
everson.
it
is
said
in
the
mcgowan.
it
said
it
in
allen.
and
it
said
in
walz.
furthermore,
this
court
has
found
that
in
focusing
on
the
nature
of
the
primary
effect,
you
look
at
the
functions
subsidized,
not
the
institution
benefiting.
it
is
said
this
in
everson.
it’s
said
in
mccollum.
it’s
said
it
in
allen
and
it
found
both
in
pierce
against
the
society
of
sisters.
43
years
ago
and
in
board
of
education
against
allen,
three
years
ago
that
these
schools
do
provide
a
secular
function.
now,
what
would
be
the
effect,
what
would
be
the
effect
of
following
the
lower
court’s
concept
of
the
primary
effect
test?
it
would
be
as
follows,
we
would
roll
back,
the
law
of
church
and
state
25
years,
if
we
found
that
because
a
secular
statute
that
had
a
secular
set
gave
incidental
aid
to
religion
that
it
failed
to
pass
constitutional
muster
then
we
must
of
necessity
reverse
everson.
we
must
reverse
mcgowan.
we
must
reverse
allen.
and
we
must
reverse
walz.
and
if
we
consider
the
nature
of
the
word
significant,
significant
aid
to
a
secular
enterprise,
then
we
better
focus
on
how
significant
the
aid
is
here.
the
aid
here,
161
teachers
from
98
schools
or
one-and-a-half
teachers
per
school,
receiving
$900.00
salary
supplement
pails
into
insignificance
compared
to
the
significance
of
the
aid
in
everson
in
1947
when
a
whole
school
load
of
children
were
bussed
to
and
from
school.
simple
arithmetic
will
tell
you
that
if
you
are
paid
ten
cents
a
ride
to
take
300
little
boys
and
girls
to
and
from
school
on
a
180
school
days
a
years,
twice
a
day,
you’re
talking
about
$12,000.00
or
$13,000.00.
in
board
of
education
against
allen,
we
talked
about
giving
textbooks
or
lending
textbooks
to
the
children
of
the
new
york
elementary
schools.
if
they
received
their
textbook
in
mathematics,
if
they
received
their
textbook
in
science,
if
they
received
their
textbook
in
a
foreign
language,
then
we
are
talking
about
a
per-pupil
expenditure
or
a
per
school
expenditure
that
dwarfs
the
expenditure
that
is
countenance
in
this
particular
statute.
so,
i
suggest
that
when
the
court
strikes
down
the
rhode
island
statute
as
failing
to
pass
the
primary
test
facet
of
the
test
fashioned
by
this
court,
because
it
is
giving
significant
aid
to
the
schools,
it
is
running
counter
to
the
whole
train
of
decisions
of
this
court.
now,
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
they
couldn’t
be
mr.
justice
because
the
record
shows
they
make
$1800.00
a
year.
obviously,
if
the
school
as
the
record
shows
couldn’t
afford
to
pay
an
extra
thousand
dollars
to
get
quality
lay
teachers,
it
couldn’t
afford
to
escalate
the
nuns
from
$1800.00
to
$4,000.00
a
year,
when
there
were
seven
or
eight
nuns
teaching
in
these
schools
and
one
or
two
layman.
so
that
the
nuns,
practically,
as
the
record
shows,
absolutely
cannot
qualify
for
this
aid,
the
record
does
show
if
the
court
please,
that
one
nun
did
and
she
qualified
because
her
mother
was
dying,
she
had
to
leave
the
order,
she
had
to
go
out
and
earn
money
to
support
her
mother
and
live
outside
of
the
convent.
and
she
made
application
because
she
was
teaching
a
holy
secular
subject.
but
other
than
that,
there
is
no
qualification
of
religious
under
the
statute,
only
342
lay
teachers
qualified
of
whom
only
161
came
forward,
because
indeed,
the
teacher
may
not
come
forward
and
ask
for
the
supplement
unless
the
school
qualifies
by
filing
what
is
known
as
an
nps
nonpublic
school
form
31,
showing
that
its
per-pupil
expenditure
is
less
than
the
per-pupil
expenditure
at
the
public
school
so
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
for
the
secular
education.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
(voice
overlap).
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
depends
upon
the
order
to
which
they
belong.
i
think
some
nuns
do
take
the
bow
of
poverty
and
i
think
some
do
not.
i
think
it’s
entirely
a
question
of
the
order
to
which
they
adhere.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
guess,
$1,800.00
probably
as
just
walking
around
money
at
these
days
mr.
justice
[laughter]
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
i
think
that
they
are
allowed
to
leave
the
convent
but
i
don’t
think
they
can
go
very
far
at
$1,800.00
at
these
--
[laughter],
but
that’s
the
maximum
that
they’re
paid
under
the
rhode
island
school
system.
and
they
get
$1,900.00
if
they
have
a
master’s
degree.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
that
this
was
expressed
and
articulated
clearly,
perhaps
for
the
first
time
in
walz
against
the
tax
commission.
and
the
question
then
becomes,
because
this
is
the
caveat
of
walz
as
i
read
it.
it
does
not
abrogate
the
purpose
and
primary
effect
test
at
all.
it
simply
adds
a
caveat
to
the
primary
effect
test,
the
purpose
and
primary
effect
test.
and
it
says
if
the
program,
if
the
statute
creates
an
excessive
entanglement
between
church
and
religion,
then
the
statute
must
fail.
and
then
the
court
made
a
calculated
choice
between
the
exemption
of
the
ad
valorem
tax
for
churches
and
the
imposition
of
the
ad
valorem
tax
for
churches
and
found
that
there
was
a
lesser
degree
of
involvement
resulting
from
the
exemption
than
from
the
imposition
looking
down
the
road
and
apparently
shunning
the
prospect
of
foreclosing
on
a
church.
i
suggest,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
same
rationale
holds
here,
because
this
court
in
discussing
this
problem
had
this
to
say,
it
said
“if
the
quality
of
teaching,”
this
is
at
page
37
of
the
record,
“falls
too
low,
then
not
only
will
catholic
parents
be
reluctant
to
enroll
their
children,
but
the
parochial
school
will
run
afoul
of
rhode
island’s
education
laws.
50
years
ago,
this
court
said
that
parents
could
satisfy
the
compulsory
school
attendance
laws
of
this
nation
by
sending
their
children
to
these
schools.
the
unspoken
corollary
of
that
of
course
was
that
the
was
that
the
state
had
the
right
to
regulate
the
secular
facet
of
these
schools
and
indeed
they
have.
they’ve
regulated
the
number
of
days
to
which
children
must
go,
they’ve
picked
the
holidays,
they’ve
required
certification
of
the
teachers
and
they
indeed
have
insisted
that
certain
subjects
be
thought,
rhode
island
has
done
the
same.
now
i
say,
if
the
court
please,
that
if
the
state
can
compel
then,
it
may
assist.
and
that’s
what
its
doing
here.
i
say
that
the
degree
of
involvement
between
the
operation
of
these
schools
and
the
compulsory
school
attendance
laws
of
rhode
island
and
the
country
in
fact,
make
the
degree
of
involvement
of
paying
$900.00
to
a
teacher
di
minimus.
i
say
also
that
if
the
legislative
judgement
has
been
made
by
the
state
of
rhode
island,
that
these
schools
cannot
attract
and
hold
qualified
teacher
for
secular
subjects,
without
those
teachers
being
given
a
subsidy,
then,
the
quality
of
secular
education
in
those
schools
is
going
to
fall.
and
when
it
becomes
marginal,
the
ugly
confrontation
which
this
court
eschewed
in
walz
against
the
tax
commission
becomes
a
reality,
because
then,
there
comes
the
kind
of
entanglement,
the
kind
of
excessive
entanglement
that
this
court
expressed
its
abhorrence
for
last
year
in
walz
against
the
tax
commission.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
that
statutes
of
rhode
island
cover
this,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
is
a
statute
called
compulsory
attendance.
it
is
in
title
16,
chapter
19
of
the
rhode
island
general
statutes,
and
this
tells
what
the
state
of
rhode
island
insists
upon
from
all
nonprofit,
nonpublic
schools
if
they
are
to
meet
the
standards
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
suspect
mr.
justice
that
there
is
no
surveillance
on
that
subject.
i
suspect
there
is
none,
but
the
record
is
silent
on
it.
i
don’t
know
of
surveillance
on
that.
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
when
one
of
these
161
teachers
signs
a
statement
applying
for
supplement
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
that’s
correct.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
mr.
justice
which
shows
a
regular
inspection.
i
am
quite
sure
that
if
there
was
a
charge
that
certain
subject
were
not
being
thought
as
demanded
by
the
statutory
scheme
of
the
state
of
rhode
island
or
that
non-qualified,
non-certified
teachers
were
purporting
to
teach
subjects
that
were
required
to
be
thought,
that
there
would
be
appropriate
action
taken
by
rhode
islands’
state
board
of
education.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
for
the
schools?
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir.
that
is
provided
for
in
the
section
to
which
i
referred
to
chief
justice,
chapter
16
title
19,
that
they
must
be
approved
by
the
board
of
education
of
the
township
or
the
city
or
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
to
that
extent
there
is
of
all
nonpublic
schools.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
that’s
another
way
of
expressing
my
thought,
mr.
juctice.
i
say
that
the
degree
of
supervision
required
by
the
salary
supplement
act
is
de
minimus
compared
to
the
supervision
that
is
authorized
and
required
by
the
statute
to
make
sure
that
these
schools
fulfill
the
requirements
of
the
compulsory
school
attendance
laws
of
the
state
of
the
state
of
rhode
island.
and
indeed,
they
have
been
found
these
schools
to
fulfill
less
compulsory
attendance
laws
and
have
provided
a
secular
service
to
the
state
with
the
approval
of
this
court
and
without
challenge
for
some
50
years
since
pierce
against
society
of
sisters.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think,
mr.
justice,
that
the
aid
would
be
greater.
i
don’t
think
the
principles
would
be
different
so
long
as
the
function
being
subsidized
is
secularly
segregable.
i
think
that’s
why
this
court
sits
to
test
that
kind
of
situation
in
the
event
that
it
arises.
i
think
it’s
quite
unlikely
in
the
state
of
rhode
island
that
the
supplement
that
is
granted
to
the
nonpublic,
nonprofit
schools
will
exceed
that
which
is
given
to
the
public
schools,
namely
30%
under
the
existing
statute.
i
would
like
to
reserve
whatever
time
i
have
remaining
for
rebuttal.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i’d
like
to
take
these
few
minutes
to
just
correct
two
impressions
that
have
been
left
with
the
court,
in
the
argument
of
counsel.
mr.
pfeffer
suggested
to
the
court
that
the
superintendent
of
schools,
for
the
parochial
schools
of
rhode
islands,
testified
that
if
the
statute
were
held
unconstitutional,
then
the
money
would
just
continue
to
come
from
the
parish.
the
record
shows
first
of
all,
that
what
the
superintendent
testified
to,
was
that
the
contracts
with
his
teaches
were
signed
after
the
statutes
were
passed.
and
that
because
the
individual
schools
were
bound
by
those
contracts,
they
would
have
to
pay
for
that
year,
the
amount
of
money
called
for
in
the
contract,
because
it
had
been
executed,
but
it
did
not
suggest,
he
did
not
suggest,
he
did
not
say
that
thereafter,
that
the
schools
would
be
able
to
continue
this
higher
stipend.
now,
an
issue
has
been
injected
in
the
last
moments
of
the
arguments
here.
the
suggestion
has
been
made
that
there
are
some
kind
of
exclusion
policy
in
these
schools,
either
racial
or
religious.
and
i
receive
the
(inaudible)
this
morning
from
mr.
pfeffer,
when
he
said
that
i
had
misstated
title
6
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act.
well,
title
6
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act
is
specifically
incorporated
in
the
rhode
island
salary
supplement
statute.
it's
precisely
stated
such
regulations
shall
ensure
that
any
non-public
school,
as
that
term
is
defined
earlier
in
this
chapter,
which
employs
teachers
who
receive
salary
supplements,
as
provided
for
in
this
chapter
shall
comply
with
the
provisions
contained
in
title
6
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
and
the
suggestion
was
made
this
morning
that
there
was
exemption
for
religion.
well,
there
is
an
exemption
for
religion.
there's
a
very
narrow
circumscribed
exemption
for
religious
in
title
42
2008,
section
1,
in
hiring
policies
of
institutions,
where
the
hiring
is
by
a
religious
institution,
for
a
religious
activity,
it
is
so
that
a
religious
school
does
not
have
to
hire
somebody
of
a
different
religion
to
teach
religion,
which
would
have
no
acquisition
to
this
case,
because
religion
teachers
are
excluded
from
the
benefits
of
the
act,
in
any
event.
there
was
no
suggestion
at
any
time,
until
the
veining
hours
of
the
argument
here
in
this
court
that
there
was
ever
any
exclusion
on
the
basis
of
race
from
any
of
these
schools,
never
at
any
time
in
the
lower
court,
and
indeed
the
record
is
diametrically
to
the
contrary,
and
i
invite
the
court
to
read
it.
and
i
suggest
likewise,
there
has
been
no
evidence
produced
in
this
record,
in
the
lower
court,
that
anyone
is
excluded
from
these
school
by
virtue
of
religion
for
indeed
the
record
once
again
is
diametrically
opposite
to
the
suggestion
that
was
made
in
the
closing
moments
of
counsel's
argument.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
page
223
of
the
appendix,
if
the
court
please—
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
counsel
said
that,
that
was
a
stipulation
between
the
parties,
nothing
could
be
farther
from
the
fact,
i
suggest.
if
you
read
the
record
here,
from
pages
120
to
127,
you
will
see
the
long
colloquy
that
went
on,
between
counsel
with
respect
to
the
admission
of
this
handbook
in
evidence.
and
it
was
pointed
out
that
many
sections
of
the
handbook
were
superseded
or
never
operative
and
that
were
never
put
into
practice.
and
the
counsel
met
and
stipulated
with
respect
to
certain
portions
of
the
handbook
and
that
whole
dialog
is
contained
between
120
and
127.
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
there
never
was
an
issue
in
this
case,
there
never
was
an
issue
to
which
this
particular
section
could
be
germane,
because
there
was
no
proof
of
exclusion
on
a
racial
or
religious
grounds.
for
these
reasons,
we
ask
that
this
court
uphold
the
constitutionality
of
the
rhode
island
salary
supplement
act,
as
applied
to
the
teachers
in
the
nonprofit,
nonpublic
schools.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
handbook
was
promulgated
in
1965
mr.
justice
and—
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
and
given
by
the
superintendent
of
schools—
mr.

the
parochial
schools
in
rhode
island,
and
given
to
the
principals
of
the
various
schools
and
all
of
the
teachers,
who
testified
in
this
record

thoroughly
unfamiliar
with
it,
because
none
of
them
had
either
been
asked
to
follow
it
nor
was
anyone
in
possession
of
it,
nor
was
anyone
in

following.

he
gave

mr.
edward
bennett
williams
he
gave
it
to
the
principals,
because
i
believe
it
was
an
aspiration
for
the
way
that
he
wished
these
schools
to
operate,
but
in
fact,
they
were
not
operated
and
the
testimony
in
the
record
is
to
fact
that
they
were
not
operated
under
the
sample.

edward
bennett

the
testimony
of

121,

was
stated,
they
will
be
read
in
to
the
record
with
the
understanding
that
if
father
mullin
were
called,
he
would
testify
that
although
they
have
never
been
formally
repealed

superseded
by
a
written
document,
nevertheless
they
are
not
now
in
effect

not
being
carried
out.
and

they
go
on
to

out
the
various
sections,
the
various
paragraphs

the
various
subdivisions,
which
have
been
inoperative
or
superseded.
