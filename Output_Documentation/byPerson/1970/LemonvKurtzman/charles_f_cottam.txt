mr.
charles
f.
cottam
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
this
honorable
court,
if
it
please
the
court,
i
will
open
and
present
the
case
numbered
570
and
will
be
followed
by
mr.
williams
who
will
present
569.
i
expect
to
take
approximately
15
minutes
in
presenting
570.
now
your
honors
please,
this
matter
numbered
570
is
before
you
on
appeal
from
a
three-judge
district
court
in
rhode
island
declaring
one
of
the
public
laws
of
1969
which
is
commonly
referred
to
as
the
salary
supplement
act
on
the
grounds
that
if
violates
the
first
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
by
reason
of
the
entanglement
that
is
inherent
in
the
act.
the
case
comes
before
this
court
with
rather
a
substantial
record,
there
is
substantial
documentary
evidence,
depositions
and
there
was
oral
testimony
below.
i
would
like
for
just
a
moment
to
analyze
the
act
which
is
very
brief.
section
i
of
the
act
sets
forth
the
legislative
findings
and
in
essence
it
sets
forth
much
of
the
crisis,
which
you
have
heard
testimony
about
this
morning
involving
these
other
cases
that
have
been
before
you.
particularizing
in
rhode
island,
the
non-public
schools
are
facing
a
crisis
at
the
elementary
school
level.
at
this
level,
45,000
or
25%
of
these
children
are
educated
in
non-public
schools.
the
crisis
arises
by
reason
of
the
financial
difficulties
of
the
schools
in
their
ability
to
offer
a
substantial
or
a
competing
salary
for
qualified
teachers
that
are
qualified
and
are
teaching
in
the
public
schools
of
the
state.
they
pointed
out
that
in
1960,
this
crisis
was
recognized
by
the
state
on
behalf
of
the
cities
and
towns
in
which
the
state
of
rhode
island
participates
not
rather
heavily
in
the
cost
of
the
education
of
the
public
school
students.
section
ii
of
the
act
pertains
to
definitions
and
under
the
act,
the
non-public
school
is
a
non-profit
school
and
it
is
one
where
the
per
student
cost
of
education
does
not
equal
or
exceed
the
cost
per
student
cost
of
education
for
a
public
school
student.
now,
a
non-public
school
teacher
is
defined
as
a
teacher
in
a
non-public
school
and
one
who
teaches
only
subjects
which
are
required
to
be
taught
in
the
public
school
and
one
who
teaches
only
subjects
which
are
required
to
be
taught
in
the
public
schools
of
the
state.
now
those
non-public
school
teachers
who
become
eligible
for
what
we
call
a
salary
supplement
which
is
roughly
15%
of
their
salary,
must
satisfy
certain
requirements
that
are
set
forth
in
the
act.
that
is,
number
one
the
teacher
must
request
the
supplement.
number
two—
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
the
individual
teacher,
your
honor.
now
the
teacher
must
also
teach
secular
subjects
to
the
same
extent
as
those
subjects
are
taught
in
the
public
schools
of
the
state.
and
that
teacher
must
also
use
materials
that
is
textbooks
and
the
like
which
are
used
in
the
public
schools
of
the
state
and
in
addition
to
this,
the
teacher
must
promise
that
he
will
not
teach
a
course
in
religion
so
long
as
he
is
receiving
the
salary
supplement.
now,
the
regulations
that
are
set
forth
or
the
power
to
make
regulations
that
are
given
in
section
v
of
the
act,
make
it
very
clear
that
the
payment
is
to
be
made
directly
to
the
teacher
and
not
the
schools.
it’s
a
mandatory
requirement
to
be
put
in
the
regulations.
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
there’s
no
check,
there
is
a
statement
signed,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
that's
all
is
required.
just
a
promise
of
the
teacher
which
is
on
a
form
developed
by
our
commission
of
education.
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
it’s
15%
of
the
salary
that
the
teacher
has
contracted
for
and
there’s
a
limitation,
that
salary
then
including
the
supplement
must
not
exceed
the
average
maximum
pay
to
a
teacher
in
a
public
school
system
of
our
state.
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
no,
it
does
not
your
honor.
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
as
i
recall,
it
was
not
a
sworn
statement.
it
is
a
direct
misrepresentation
and
because
in
the
presence
of
evidence
to
that
contrary,
you
would
lose
the
supplement.
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
yes,
your
honor,
unless
the
state
itself
could
prove
a
damage
claim
for
misrepresentation
which
under
rhode
island
law
would
mean
you’d
have
to
prove
a
preexisting
intent.
now,
your
honor,
the
complaint
that
was
filed
in
this
case
alleges
in
substance
that
this
act,
which
i
just
highlighted
to
you,
provides
direct
aid
to
a
parochial
school.
and
i
think,
in
addition
to
that,
it
alleges
that
the
purpose
and
primary
effect
of
the
act
is
to
advance
religion,
the
answers
that
were
filed
amount
to
a
general
denial.
as
far
as
the
evidence
is
concerned
which
i
think
--
it
should
be
of
great
interest
to
the
court
and
was
in
the
court
below
is
the
handbook
of
the
school
regulations
issued
by
the
roman
catholic
diocese
at
providence
that
referred
to
any
opposition
brief
and
the
depositions
in
the
oral
testimony
that
was
presented.
now,
the
testimony
itself
is
i
think
of
a
great
importance
because
it
highlights
the
difference
that
i
think
this
court
has
indicated
in
the
past
decisions
between
so
called
atmosphere
and
permeation.
the
evidence
clearly
shows
that
these
all
parochial
schools
that
are
principally
affected
under
this
rhode
island
act,
that
there
are
--
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
no,
there
is
no
restriction
your
honor,
we
do
have
the
deposition
of
one
religious
teacher
who
is
on
leave
from
her
order
who
was
in.
but
its
faith
of
god
to
believe
that
a
religious
would
qualify
under
the
act
because
their
life
is
dedicated
to
the
propagation
of
religion
and
under
this
act,
you
are
immediately
disqualified
if
you
teach
religion.
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
yes
your
honor,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
yes
it
is
your
honor.
now,
before
i
leave
the
act
--
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
i
think
there
are
some
90
parochial
elementary,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
well,
there
are
some
29,000
or
almost
30,000
elementary
school
children
that
are
affected
by
this
act.
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
out
of
approximately
45,000,
roughly
66%
that
comes
from
you
will
notice
in
the
legislative
findings
that
refer
to
roughly
to
45,000
as
being
educated
in
nonpublic
schools.
but
the
testimony
of
the
superintendent
of
schools
for
the
diocese
in
providence
father
moen
indicated
that
there
are
roughly
29,340
with
maybe
a
couple
over.
now
your
honor,
as
far
as
the
testimony
was
concerned
there's
just
no
question
about
the
proximity
usually
of
these
schools
to
a
church
the
presence
of
statutes
and
the
presence
or
crucifixions.
but
i
do
think
what
is
of
paramount
importance
is
the
absolute
unrebutted
unequivocal
and
un-contradicted
testimony
of
every
deponent
and
every
witness
that
religious
content
was
not
injected
into
the
teaching
of
a
secular
subject.
in
other
words
--
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
you’re
referring
now
to
a
religious
person,
a
nun?
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
oh
yes,
you
couldn't
qualify
under
this
unless
you
gave
up
--
that
testimony
as
i
indicated
is
just
unrebutted
and
it's
unequivocal.
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
no,
your
honor,
it’s
made
twice
a
year,
in
february
and
in
june,
under
the
regulations
they
were
issued
pursuant
--
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
directly,
that
is
a
must,
the
statute.
i
think
that
section
5
requires
that
the
salary
must
be
paid
directly
to
the
teacher.
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
correct
an
impression
i
may
have
left
with
this
court
this
morning
your
honor
when
you
asked
me
the
question
was
there
a
false
document
statute
--
i
thought
your
honor
was
referring
to
the
act
in
question
that
is
the
salary
supplement
act
when
i
responded
no,
there
is
such
a
--
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
yes,
there
is
your
honor.
and
there
is
also
a
larceny
statute
where
a
document
is
filed
with
false
intent.
with
the
few
minutes
remaining
your
honor,
i
think
i
will
not
get
in
to
an
analysis
of
the
decision
of
the
court
below
but
rather
i
would
like
to
take
a
moment
again
to
call
your
attention
to
the
evidence
that
was
submitted
to
the
court
below
and
the
findings.
and
i
would
like
to
make
the
observation
that
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
findings
as
made
by
the
court
below.
the
question,
we
have
and
the
disagreement
we
have
is
what
the
court's
analysis
of
the
schempp,
allen,
walz
test
and
its
presence
and
existence
and
the
effect
of
walz
on
schempp
allen
and
this
will
be
covered
by
mr.
williams.
going
back
into
the
evidence
that
was
submitted
by
the
court
to
the
court
below.
the
evidence
as
i
indicated
is
overwhelming
and
uncontradicted,
and
un-rebutted
that
there
is
absolutely
no
sign
of
permeation
in
existence.
as
far
as
the
act
itself
is
concerned,
the
state
feels
that
one
of
the
great
features
of
the
act
is
its
voluntary
provisions.
no
school
is
required
to
tailor
its
curriculum
to
come
within
the
provisions
of
this
act.
no
teacher
is
required
to
teach
in
a
parochial
school.
and
no
teacher
who
teaches
in
a
parochial
or
non
public
school
is
required
to
come
within
the
provisions
of
the
salary
supplement
act.
as
far
as
this
being
a
restraint
on
the
individual
teaching,
my
response
to
that
is
that
it’s
voluntary.
there
is
nothing
in
the
act
which
requires
either
the
school
or
the
teacher
to
conform
to
the
act.
in
summation
your
honor,
it
is
the
position
of
the
state
that
the
evidence
submitted
in
the
court
below
indicated
very
clearly
that
this
act
is
designed
to
meet
a
crisis
in
the
state
of
rhode
island
at
the
parochial
school
level.
it’s
also
designed
to
provide
a
quality
education
that
the
state
feels
is
necessary.
the
court
found
and
the
evidence
supports
the
finding,
that
the
purpose
of
the
act
is
entirely
secular.
the
evidence
introduced
below
indicates
a
total
absence
of
permeation
within
the
meaning
of
the
allen
decision
so
that
all
of
that
remains
to
be
done
is
to
test
the
continuing
existence
and
the
applicability
of
this
court’s
prior
decisions
to
this
statute.
thank
you
very
much
your
honor.
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
with
what
decision
your
honor?
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
well,
i
think,
it’s
entirely
--
no,
it’s
not
entirely
different.
i
disagree
with
their
finding
on
entanglement
because
there
was
no
evidence
presented
in
the
court
below.
there
is
no
record
in
the
pennsylvania
case
your
honor,
did
this
court
in
rhode
island,
the
three-judge
court
sitting
in
rhode
island
went
off
on
the
ground
that
this
statute
engendered
excessive
entanglement
that
was
referred
to
in
the
walz
decision,
because
they
felt
that
there
was
an
inhibition
of
teachers
and
that
the
continuing
surveillance
that
would
--
the
act
would
require
to
determine
what
part
of
the
schools’
budget
is
religious
and
what
is
secular
was
too
extensive
for
an
entanglement.
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
yes
your
honor.
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
no,
your
honor,
i
don’t
argue
constitutionality
based
on
crisis,
but
in
one
of
the
questions
you
asked
mr.
ball
this
morning,
i
would
like
to
respond.
the
essence
of
the
question
was,
if
the
monies
were
paid
to
the
school,
did
not
just
supply
the
school
with
additional
fund
for
other
purpose.
my
answer
is
these
schools
are
closing
your
honor,
there
are
no
other
funds
for
these
purposes.
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
well,
it’s
not
substantially
different
your
honor.
the
arguments
presented
to
the
court
below
was
let
the
parishes
pay
and
there
was
no
showing
that
they
couldn’t.
they
was
no
showing
that
they
could.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
the
schools
are
closing
which
i
think
speaks
for
itself.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
this
honorable
court,
if
it
please
the
court,
i
will
open
and
present
the
case
numbered
570
and
will
be
followed
by
mr.
williams
who
will
present
569.
i
expect
to
take
approximately
15
minutes
in
presenting
570.
now
your
honors
please,
this
matter
numbered
570
is
before
you
on
appeal
from
a
three-judge
district
court
in
rhode
island
declaring
one
of

the
first
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
by
reason
of
the
entanglement
that
is
inherent
in
the
act.
the
case
comes
before
this
court
with
rather
a
substantial
record,
there
is
substantial
documentary
evidence,
depositions
and
there
was
oral
testimony
below.
i
would
like
for
just
a
moment
to
analyze
the
act
which
is
very
brief.
section

the

to
be
made
directly
to
the
teacher
and
not
the
schools.
it’s
a
mandatory
requirement
to
be
put
in
the
regulations.
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
there’s
no
check,
there
is
a
statement
signed,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
that's
all
is
required.
just
a
promise
of
the
teacher
which
is
on
a
form
developed
by
our
commission
of
education.
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
it’s
15%
of
the
salary
that
the
teacher
has
contracted
for
and
there’s
a
limitation,
that
salary
then
including
the
supplement
must
not
exceed
the
average
maximum
pay
to
a
teacher
in
a
public
school
system
of
our
state.
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
no,
it
does
not
your
honor.
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
as
i
recall,
it
was
not
a
sworn
statement.
it
is
a
direct
misrepresentation
and
because
in
the
presence
of
evidence
to
that
contrary,
you
would
lose
the
supplement.
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
yes,
your
honor,
unless
the
state
itself
could
prove
a
damage
claim
for
misrepresentation
which
under
rhode
island
law
would
mean
you’d
have
to
prove
a
preexisting
intent.
now,
your
honor,
the
complaint
that
was
filed
in
this
case
alleges
in
substance
that
this
act,
which
i
just
highlighted
to
you,
provides
direct
aid
to
a
parochial
school.
and
i
think,
in
addition
to
that,
it
alleges
that
the
purpose
and
primary
effect
of
the
act
is
to
advance
religion,
the
answers
that
were
filed
amount
to
a
general
denial.
as
far
as
the
evidence
is
concerned
which
i
think
--
it
should
be
of
great
interest
to
the
court
and
was
in
the
court
below
is
the
handbook
of
the
school
regulations
issued
by
the
roman
catholic
diocese
at
providence
that
referred
to
any
opposition
brief
and
the
depositions
in
the
oral
testimony
that
was
presented.
now,
the
testimony
itself
is
i
think
of
a
great
importance
because
it
highlights
the
difference
that
i
think
this
court
has
indicated
in
the
past
decisions
between
so
called
atmosphere
and
permeation.
the
evidence
clearly
shows
that
these
all
parochial
schools
that
are
principally
affected
under
this
rhode
island
act,
that
there
are
--
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
no,
there
is
no
restriction
your
honor,
we
do
have
the
deposition
of
one
religious
teacher
who
is
on
leave
from
her
order
who
was
in.
but
its
faith
of
god
to
believe
that
a
religious
would
qualify
under
the
act
because
their
life
is
dedicated
to
the
propagation
of
religion
and
under
this
act,
you
are
immediately
disqualified
if
you
teach
religion.
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
yes
your
honor,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
yes
it
is
your
honor.
now,
before
i
leave
the
act
--
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
i
think
there
are
some
90
parochial
elementary,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
well,
there
are
some
29,000
or
almost
30,000
elementary
school
children
that
are
affected
by
this
act.
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
out
of
approximately
45,000,
roughly
66%
that
comes
from
you
will
notice
in
the
legislative
findings
that
refer
to
roughly
to
45,000
as
being
educated
in
nonpublic
schools.
but
the
testimony
of
the
superintendent
of
schools
for
the
diocese
in
providence
father
moen
indicated
that
there
are
roughly
29,340
with
maybe
a
couple
over.
now
your
honor,
as
far
as
the
testimony
was
concerned
there's
just
no
question
about
the
proximity
usually
of
these
schools
to
a
church
the
presence
of
statutes
and
the
presence
or
crucifixions.
but
i
do
think
what
is
of
paramount
importance
is
the
absolute
unrebutted
unequivocal
and
un-contradicted
testimony
of
every
deponent
and
every
witness
that
religious
content
was
not
injected
into
the
teaching
of
a
secular
subject.
in
other
words
--
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
you’re
referring
now
to
a
religious
person,
a
nun?
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
oh
yes,
you
couldn't
qualify
under
this
unless
you
gave
up
--
that
testimony
as
i
indicated
is
just
unrebutted
and
it's
unequivocal.
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
no,
your
honor,
it’s
made
twice
a
year,
in
february
and
in
june,
under
the
regulations
they
were
issued
pursuant
--
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
directly,
that
is
a
must,
the
statute.
i
think
that
section
5
requires
that
the
salary
must
be
paid
directly
to
the
teacher.
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
correct
an
impression
i
may
have
left
with
this
court
this
morning
your
honor
when
you
asked
me
the
question
was
there
a
false
document
statute
--
i
thought
your
honor
was
referring
to
the
act
in
question
that
is
the
salary
supplement
act
when
i
responded
no,
there
is
such
a
--
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
yes,
there
is
your
honor.
and
there
is
also
a
larceny
statute
where
a
document
is
filed
with
false
intent.
with
the
few
minutes
remaining
your
honor,
i
think
i
will
not
get
in
to
an
analysis
of
the
decision
of
the
court
below
but
rather
i
would
like
to
take
a
moment
again
to
call
your
attention
to
the
evidence
that
was
submitted
to
the
court
below
and
the
findings.
and
i
would
like
to
make
the
observation
that
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
findings
as
made
by
the
court
below.
the
question,
we
have
and
the
disagreement
we
have
is
what
the
court's
analysis
of
the
schempp,
allen,
walz
test
and
its
presence
and
existence
and
the
effect
of
walz
on
schempp
allen
and
this
will
be
covered
by
mr.
williams.
going
back
into
the
evidence
that
was
submitted
by
the
court
to
the
court
below.
the
evidence
as
i
indicated
is
overwhelming
and
uncontradicted,
and
un-rebutted
that
there
is
absolutely
no
sign
of
permeation
in
existence.
as
far
as
the
act
itself
is
concerned,
the
state
feels
that
one
of
the
great
features
of
the
act
is
its
voluntary
provisions.
no
school
is
required
to
tailor
its
curriculum
to
come
within
the
provisions
of
this
act.
no
teacher
is
required
to
teach
in
a
parochial
school.
and
no
teacher
who
teaches
in
a
parochial
or
non
public
school
is
required
to
come
within
the
provisions
of
the
salary
supplement
act.
as
far
as
this
being
a
restraint
on
the
individual
teaching,
my
response
to
that
is
that
it’s
voluntary.
there
is
nothing
in
the
act
which
requires
either
the
school
or
the
teacher
to
conform
to
the
act.
in
summation
your
honor,
it
is
the
position
of
the
state
that
the
evidence
submitted
in
the
court
below
indicated
very
clearly
that
this
act
is
designed
to
meet
a
crisis
in
the
state
of
rhode
island
at
the
parochial
school
level.
it’s
also
designed
to
provide
a
quality
education
that
the
state
feels
is
necessary.
the
court
found
and
the
evidence
supports
the
finding,
that
the
purpose
of
the
act
is
entirely
secular.
the
evidence
introduced
below
indicates
a
total
absence
of
permeation
within
the
meaning
of
the
allen
decision
so
that
all
of
that
remains
to
be
done
is
to
test
the
continuing
existence
and
the
applicability
of
this
court’s
prior
decisions
to
this
statute.
thank
you
very
much
your
honor.
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
with
what
decision
your
honor?
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
well,
i
think,
it’s
entirely
--
no,
it’s
not
entirely
different.
i
disagree
with
their
finding
on
entanglement
because
there
was
no
evidence
presented
in
the
court
below.
there
is
no
record
in
the
pennsylvania
case
your
honor,
did
this
court
in
rhode
island,
the
three-judge
court
sitting
in
rhode
island
went
off
on
the
ground
that
this
statute
engendered
excessive
entanglement
that
was
referred
to
in
the
walz
decision,
because
they
felt
that
there
was
an
inhibition
of
teachers
and
that
the
continuing
surveillance
that
would
--
the
act
would
require
to
determine
what
part
of
the
schools’
budget
is
religious
and
what
is
secular
was
too
extensive
for
an
entanglement.
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
yes
your
honor.
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
no,
your
honor,
i
don’t
argue
constitutionality
based
on
crisis,
but
in
one
of
the
questions
you
asked
mr.
ball
this
morning,
i
would
like
to
respond.
the
essence
of
the
question
was,
if
the
monies
were
paid
to
the
school,
did
not
just
supply
the
school
with
additional
fund
for
other
purpose.
my
answer
is
these
schools
are
closing
your
honor,
there
are
no
other
funds
for
these
purposes.
mr.
charles
f.
cottam
well,
it’s
not
substantially
different
your
honor.
the
arguments
presented
to
the
court
below
was
let
the
parishes
pay
and
there
was
no
showing
that
they
couldn’t.
they
was
no
showing
that
they
could.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
the
schools
are
closing
which
i
think
speaks
for
itself.
thank
you
very
much.
