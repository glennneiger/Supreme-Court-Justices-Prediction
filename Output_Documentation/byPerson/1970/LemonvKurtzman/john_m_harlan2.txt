could
i
ask
you
a
preliminary
question,
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
much
surveillance
is
involved
in
satisfying
a
--
is
there
an
inspection
to
see
whether
the
parochial
schools
to
keep
(voice
overlap)
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
i’m
not
thinking
about
that.
you’ve
told
us
that
parochial
schools
are
already
subject
to
a
number
of
minimum
standards.
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
subsidy
statutes?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
this
is
to
in
all
50
states
and
now
my
question
was,
is
there
a
degree
of
supervision
of
compliance
for
those
standards
on
the
part
of
any
education
(voice
overlap)
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
are
there
are
accreditation
procedures
for
them?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
in
that
extent,
then
there
is
some
provision?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
i
gather
your
point
is
that
they
can
go
that
far
without
offending
the
establishment
part
and
surely
the
contribution
by
way
of
supplement
to
a
teacher
salary
isn’t
the
excess?
