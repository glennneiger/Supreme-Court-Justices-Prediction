mr.
milton
stanzler
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
role
here
is
to
relate
the
record
to
laws
set
forth
by
mr.
pfeffer,
and
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
record
in
the
case
amply
supports
the
findings
of
fact
made
by
other
trial
court
below.
first,
i
would
like
to
explain
how
the
legislature
is
implemented.
the
deputy
commissioner
of
education
testified
and
related
that
he
was
appointed
by
the
commissioner
of
education
to
draw
up
rules
and
regulations
and
then
subsequently
after
drawing
of
the
rules
and
regulations,
they
were
considered
at
a
public
hearing,
and
they
were
adapted,
and
the
material,
the
rules
and
regulations
together
with
the
applications
forms
for
the
teachers,
and
together
with
the
nps
number
31
that
mr.
williams
referred
to,
was
sent
to
the
non-public
schools.
thereafter,
the
non-public
schools
submitted
the
accounting
forms
or
the
expenditure
sheets,
and
the
data
contained
therein,
together
with
the
applications
to
the
deputy
commissioner
of
education.
and
he
then,
reviewed
the
forms,
some
250
teachers,
and
approved
all
of
them,
all
of
them
coming
from
the
roman
catholic
schools.
i
think
in
answer
to
some
of
the
questions
that
might
be
pertinent,
just
a
moment
to
take
a
look
at
the
role
that
the
commissioner
of
education
must
play
here.
he
must
set
forth
in
page
3
of
rules
and
regulations
verify
department
of
education,
upon
receipt
of
an
application
for
a
salary
supplement,
shall
determine
the
applicant’s
eligibility
by
verifying
whether
or
not
the
applicant
complies
with
the
regulations.
the
expenditure
form,
which
is
attached
to
it,
sets
forth
a
summary
of
all
the
current
expenditures
of
the
school.
this
is
not
just
the
expenditures
for
secular
education,
that
is
set
forth.
mr.
milton
stanzler
no
your
honor,
they
would
have
to
submit
the
form
of
expenditures,
same
form,
and
provided
a
teacher
applies
as
the
commissioner
of
education
testified.
if
the
expenditures
exceed
the
per
pupil
expenditure
for
the
grade
in
the
public
schools,
then
he
will
go
into
these
schools,
and
conduct
an
audit.
and
as
he
testify,
would
may
give
determination,
as
between
the
sectarian
expenditures
and
the
secular
expenditures.
and
the
same
thing
would
apply
to
a
new
school,
if
a
new
school
wanted
to
apply
for
the
act,
and
have
its
teachers
apply,
it
would
have
to
do
the
same
thing.
mr.
milton
stanzler
i
think
that
could
probably
could
be
done,
your
honor.
and
i
think
of
the
circumstance
of
this
case,
there
was
once
school
that
didn’t
qualify,
because
its
expenditures
per
pupil
exceeded
the
expenditures
per
pupil
in
public
school.
mr.
milton
stanzler
yes
your
honor,
i
think
that
there's
a
difference
however,
with
respect
with
my
brother
pointed
out,
my
brother
pfeffer
pointed
out,
with
respect
to
reporting
the
numbers
of
students
who
were
attending
in
the
school.
there
is
a
difference
as
to
determining
between
the
--
making
a
determination
as
to
the
sectarian
expenditures
and
the
secular
expenditures,
as
required
under
this
act,
as
the
commissioner
of
education
says,
he’s
going
to
perform.
mr.
milton
stanzler
well,
i
wouldn’t
--
i
think
that
in
the
light
of
the
cases,
in
particular
the
pierce
versus
society
of
sisters
that
the
private
school
can
teach
certain
subjects,
if
they
do
not
teach
as
in
rhode
island
as
a
requirement
they
teach
history,
if
you
do
not
teach
history,
then
i
would
believe
that
they
would
lose
their
accreditation,
and
the
department
of
education
would
have
a
right
to
say
it
then,
that
you
must
teach
history
according
to
that
state
law.
mr.
milton
stanzler
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that’s
a
minimum
standards
that
they’d
have
to
meet.
but
that
does
not
have
to
--
it
seems
to
me
in
any
rate,
does
not
seem
to
interfere
with
the
religious
aspects
of
the
school
itself,
and
with
respect
to
making
an
investigation
as
now
the
commissioner
of
education
has
put
in
the
role
of
making
an
investigation
to
determine,
what
is
the
sectarian
or
what
is
not
sectarian,
and
this
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
teachers
who
apply
under
this
act
must
qualify.
to
move
on
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
point
out
the
nature
of
the
school
itself,
the
totality
of
the
religious
atmosphere
that’s
involved
in
the
school,
this
is
amply
supported
by
the
record
and
i
would
suspect
it's
almost
conceded
by
my
brothers,
but
to
point
out
the
guideline,
which
is
exhibit
14,
as
the
document
that
has
been
utilized
in
evidence
here.
this
handbook
is
in
effect,
it
has
been
modified
in
certain
forms,
and
it
is
used
and
is
binding
upon
the
administration,
the
operation
of
the
schools,
and
each
principle,
and
each
of
the
school
maintains
his
handbook.
in
order
to
complete
the
--
to
indicate
to
the
court
the
religious
atmosphere
that
is
maintained,
though
not
in
the
record
though,
part
of
the
evidence
that
as
an
exhibit
14a,
which
supportedly
where
some
modifications
of
the
guidelines
of
the
school
system,
and
this
was
related
by
judge
coffin
in
his
decision
below.
it
was
letter
dated
january
20,
1970,
which
the
court
considered
a
letter
from
father
mullin
to
the
elementary
school
principals,
where
he
pointed
out
under
the
question
of
whether
or
not,
in
light
of
the
problems
that
there
were
maintained
by
the
schools,
with
respect
of
the
proportion
of
lay
teachers
to
religious
teachers
that
father
offered
his
own
opinion.
and
this
is
in
his
letter
to
the
elementary
school
principals,
that
reducing
this
proportion
should
not
be
done,
(inaudible)
for
lay
teachers
should
be
maintained
at
all
times.
the
reasons
are:
1)
the
obvious
financial
difficulty,
and
2)
the
delusion
of
the
catholic
atmosphere
of
that
school,
that
might
result,
then
of
course,
the
financial
considerations.
the
schools
all
have
religious
and
lay
teachers,
fathers
and
priest
do
not
teach,
but
occasionally
will
teach
religion.
about
98
elementary
schools,
and
the
dioceses,
one
school
has
all
lay
teachers,
and
two
or
three
schools
have
religious
teachers.
90-95%
of
a
non-public
elementary
schools
students
are
enrolled
in
the
roman
catholic
parochial
schools.
the
diocese
averages
two
religious
teachers
to
one
lay
teacher,
religious
teachers
are
sisters
and
there
are
approximately
29,000
students
in
the
elementary
schools
from
grade
one
to
eight.
substantially,
all
of
the
children
in
the
schools
are
of
the
roman
catholic
faith.
a
great
majority
of
the
98
schools
are
all
parish
schools,
which
means
they
are
owned
and
operated
by
the
parish.
if
the
school
is
not
own
by
a
single
parish,
three
are
operated
by
two
or
three
parishes
together.
there
are
six
schools
which
are
private,
but
these
are
operated
by
a
religious
community
of
sisters,
who
own
and
operate
the
schools,
and
there
is
one
such
which
is
operated
by
the
diocese.
a
majority
the
principals
are
pointed
by
the
mother
provincial
of
the
order
sisters
which
staff
the
school.
the
last
two
years,
father
mullin
has
appointed
the
principal
of
one
of
the
schools
in
which
there
are
thirteen.
and
two
cases,
the
pastor
appoints
the
principal
and
then
one
school,
which
is
autonomous,
the
principal
is
appointed
by
the
board
of
director
of
the
school.
there
are
two
school
which
have
lay
principals.
the
religious
teachers
are
appointed
by
the
mother
provincial.
the
recruiting
process
of
the
lay
teachers
starts
in
the
superintendent’s
office,
and
one
of
his
assistants
interviews
all
of
the
applicants.
they
fill
out
an
application,
they
are
interviewed
by
one
of
the
superintendent’s
assistants,
and
she
refers
them
to
the
pastor
who
signs
the
contract
with
them.
it
might
be
pointed
out
that
with
respect
to
the
contract,
the
evidence
was
clear
that
as
mr.
pfeffer
pointed
out,
that
if
a
contractual
obligation,
let's
say
it
was
$6,000.00,
if
the
statute
was
held
to
unconstitutional,
the
parish
would
be
obligated
to
pay
the
total
of
the
$6,000.00.
finally,
the
principal
for
a
particular
school
will
interview
the
lay
teacher
after
they
are
refered
to
the
superintendent’s
office,
and
then
the
pastor
and
the
lay
teacher
will
sign
a
contract,
upon
agreement.
the
great
majority
of
lay
teachers
in
the
roman
catholic
schools
are
roman
catholics,
approximately
10-15%
are
not
roman
catholics.
the
schools
have
the
usual
embellishments
of
the
roman
catholic
school
and
is
testified
as
brought
out
when
one
visits
such
a
school,
he
knows
he
is
visiting
a
roman
catholic
parochial
school.
each
class,
day
starts
with
a
prayer
for
each
of
the
students.
they
are
usually
--
instead
at
the
beginning
of
the
day,
and
sometimes
at
the
end
of
day.
there
are
lay
teachers
or
religious
teachers
in
the
home
rooms,
where
these
prayers
are
said,
beginning
if
prayers
of
a
day
are
supervised,
are
conducted
either
by
lay
teachers
or
religious
teachers,
150
minutes
a
week
of
school
time
is
devoted
to
religious
classes.
this
curriculum
is
setup
in
the
handbook,
on
a
weekly
time
allotment
that
comes
out
each
year
in
september.
the
religious
classes
will
deal
with
the
study
of
the
various
tenets
of
the
roman
catholic
education.
since,
the
passage
of
the
act,
teachers
who
have
applied
for
the
supplement
do
not
teach
religious
courses,
but
prior
the
lay
teacher
could
if
they
wanted
to,
and
if
they
felt
competent.
it
would
be
up
to
the
individual
teacher,
to
determine
if
she
wants
to
begin
each
class
with
a
prayer.
one
reason
for
the
salary
supplement
act
or
i
might
point
out
that
there
are
sometimes
visiting
missionaries,
at
least
once
year,
and
of
course,
the
handbook
provides
that
the
vocations
programs
are
conducted
once
a
year.
there
was
testimony
given
by
one
nun,
who
did
apply
and
did
qualify
under
the
act,
and
she
was
asked
what
her
view
was
of
the
role
of
teachers
in
parochial
school.
she
said,
on
page
223
of
the
joint
appendix,
“according
to
the
religious
thinking
of
a
catholic
today,
it
is
that
young
adults
going
into
the
community,
they
should
hold
a
catholic
attitude
toward
different
things
they
meet
with
and
yet
this
is
not
totally
catholic,
it
is
a
christian
attitude.
as
teachers,
we
by
our
example,
particularly
and
our
handling
of
the
children
try
to
inculcate
in
them
the
same
christian
attitude.
as
with
religious,
we
are
toned
to
discipline,
and
we
try
to
exert
discipline
with
the
children,
so
they
will
be
open
to
studying
and
to
proper
attitude
toward
their
word.”
the
religious
atmosphere
that
permeates
at
the
school
is
that
of
the
teacher
themselves,
though
she
does
not
think
that
this
is
an
overall
religious
atmosphere.
one
of
the
principal
functions
of
the
parochial
school
she
said,
is
to
have
available
former
religious
training,
because
otherwise
the
children
would
not
be
reached,
except
in
the
catechetical
classes
after
school
and
if
you
do
not
get
them
at
an
early
age,
you
would
do,
if
you’ll
handled
them
right
from
the
first
grade.
father
geebung
(ph)
one
of
the
pastors
of
the
parish
schools
testified,
and
he
testified
that
pastor
entered
to
the
contracts
with
the
teachers
under
the
salary
aid,
it
is
understood
that
it
would
mean
the
salary
is
paid
by
the
parish,
would
be
that
much
less,
some
of
the
burden
will
be
taken
off
the
parish’s
shoulders.
it
is
most
fair
to
say
that
the
financial
responsibilities
of
the
parish
would
be
lessened,
if
the
supplement
payment
were
made.
the
money
saved
would
be
used
to
better
school,
but
it
could
be
spent
for
parish
purposes.
the
father
also
testified
that
he
would
not
hire
divorced
school
teachers,
nor
would
hire
ex-communicated
catholics
from
teaching
those
schools.
i
might
go
on
to
point
out
that
there
are
numerous
references
in
the
handbook's
exhibit
14,
which
relate
clearly
the
religious
atmosphere
of
the
school,
which
relate
and
show,
and
supplement
and
support
the
findings
of
the
court
below.
and
i
might
in
conclusion
say,
that
the
court
below,
the
record
that
it
found
in
making
new
findings,
that
it
did,
is
amply
supported
by
the
record.
i
respectfully
suggest
and
urge
the
court
to
affirm
the
findings
of
the
court
below,
thank
you.
mr.
milton
stanzler
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
role
here
is
to
relate
the
record
to
laws
set
forth
by
mr.
pfeffer,
and
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
record
in
the
case
amply
supports
the
findings
of

made
by

first,
i
would
like
to
explain
how
the

together
with
the
applications
forms
for
the
teachers,
and
together
with
the
nps
number
31
that
mr.
williams
referred
to,
was
sent
to
the
non-public
schools.
thereafter,
the
non-public
schools
submitted
the
accounting
forms
or
the
expenditure
sheets,
and
the

together
with
the

then,

i
think

that
might
be
pertinent,
just
a
moment
to
take
a
look
at
the
role
that
the
commissioner
of
education
must
play
here.
he
must
set
forth
in
page
3
of

of

upon

of

for

the

which
is
attached
to

sets
forth

of
all

this
is
not

mr.
milton
stanzler
no
your
honor,
they
would
have
to
submit
the
form
of
expenditures,
same
form,
and
provided
a
teacher
applies
as
the
commissioner
of
education
testified.
if
the
expenditures
exceed
the
per
pupil
expenditure
for
the
grade
in
the
public

then
he
will
go
into
these

conduct
an

and
as
he
testify,
would
may
give

as
between
the

and
the
same
thing
would
apply
to
a
new
school,
if
a
new
school
wanted
to
apply
for
the
act,
and
have
its
teachers
apply,
it
would
have
to
do
the
same
thing.
mr.
milton
stanzler
i
think
that
could
probably
could
be
done,
your
honor.
and
i
think
of
the
circumstance
of
this
case,
there
was
once
school
that
didn’t
qualify,
because
its
expenditures
per
pupil
exceeded
the

in
public
school.
mr.
milton
stanzler
yes
your
honor,
i
think
that
there's
a
difference
however,
with
respect
with
my
brother
pointed
out,
my
brother
pfeffer
pointed
out,
with
respect
to
reporting
the
numbers
of
students
who
were
attending
in
the

there
is
a
difference
as
to

between
the
--
making
a

as
to
the

expenditures
and
the
secular

as
required
under
this
act,
as
the
commissioner
of
education
says,
he’s
going
to
perform.
mr.
milton
stanzler
well,
i
wouldn’t
--
i
think
that
in
the
light
of
the
cases,
in
particular
the
pierce
versus
society
of
sisters
that
the
private
school
can
teach
certain
subjects,
if
they
do
not
teach
as
in
rhode
island
as
a
requirement
they
teach
history,
if
you
do
not
teach
history,
then
i
would
believe
that
they
would
lose
their
accreditation,
and
the
department
of
education
would
have
a
right
to
say
it
then,
that
you
must
teach
history
according
to
that
state
law.
mr.
milton
stanzler
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that’s
a
minimum
standards
that
they’d
have
to
meet.
but
that
does
not
have
to
--
it
seems
to
me
in
any
rate,
does
not
seem
to
interfere
with
the
religious
aspects
of
the
school
itself,
and
with
respect
to
making
an
investigation
as
now
the
commissioner
of
education
has
put
in
the
role
of
making
an
investigation
to
determine,
what
is
the
sectarian
or
what
is
not
sectarian,
and
this
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
teachers
who
apply
under
this
act
must
qualify.
to
move
on
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
point
out
the
nature
of
the
school
itself,
the
totality
of
the
religious
atmosphere
that’s
involved
in
the
school,
this
is
amply
supported
by
the
record
and
i
would
suspect
it's
almost
conceded
by
my
brothers,
but
to
point
out
the
guideline,
which
is
exhibit
14,
as
the
document
that
has
been
utilized
in
evidence
here.
this
handbook
is
in
effect,
it
has
been
modified
in
certain
forms,
and
it
is
used
and
is
binding
upon
the
administration,
the
operation
of
the
schools,
and
each
principle,
and
each
of
the
school
maintains
his
handbook.
in
order
to
complete
the
--
to
indicate
to
the
court
the
religious
atmosphere
that
is
maintained,
though
not
in
the
record
though,
part
of
the
evidence
that
as
an
exhibit
14a,
which
supportedly
where
some
modifications
of
the
guidelines
of
the
school
system,
and
this
was
related
by
judge
coffin
in
his
decision
below.
it
was
letter
dated
january
20,
1970,
which
the
court
considered
a
letter
from
father
mullin
to
the
elementary
school
principals,
where
he
pointed
out
under
the
question
of
whether
or
not,
in
light
of
the
problems
that
there
were
maintained
by
the
schools,
with
respect
of
the
proportion
of
lay
teachers
to
religious
teachers
that
father
offered
his
own
opinion.
and
this
is
in
his
letter
to
the
elementary
school
principals,
that
reducing
this
proportion
should
not
be
done,
(inaudible)
for
lay
teachers
should
be
maintained
at
all
times.
the
reasons
are:
1)
the
obvious
financial
difficulty,
and
2)
the
delusion
of
the
catholic
atmosphere
of
that
school,
that
might
result,
then
of
course,
the
financial
considerations.
the
schools
all
have
religious
and
lay
teachers,
fathers
and
priest
do
not
teach,
but
occasionally
will
teach
religion.
about
98
elementary
schools,
and
the
dioceses,
one
school
has
all
lay
teachers,
and
two
or
three
schools
have
religious
teachers.
90-95%
of
a
non-public
elementary
schools
students
are
enrolled
in
the
roman
catholic
parochial
schools.
the
diocese
averages
two
religious
teachers
to
one
lay
teacher,
religious
teachers
are
sisters
and
there
are
approximately
29,000
students
in
the
elementary
schools
from
grade
one
to
eight.
substantially,
all
of
the
children
in
the
schools
are
of
the
roman
catholic
faith.
a
great
majority
of
the
98
schools
are
all
parish
schools,
which
means
they
are
owned
and
operated
by
the
parish.
if
the
school
is
not
own
by
a
single
parish,
three
are
operated
by
two
or
three
parishes
together.
there
are
six
schools
which
are
private,
but
these
are
operated
by
a
religious
community
of
sisters,
who
own
and
operate
the
schools,
and
there
is
one
such
which
is
operated
by
the
diocese.
a
majority
the
principals
are
pointed
by
the
mother
provincial
of
the
order
sisters
which
staff
the
school.
the
last
two
years,
father
mullin
has
appointed
the
principal
of
one
of
the
schools
in
which
there
are
thirteen.
and
two
cases,
the
pastor
appoints
the
principal
and
then
one
school,
which
is
autonomous,
the
principal
is
appointed
by
the
board
of
director
of
the
school.
there
are
two
school
which
have
lay
principals.
the
religious
teachers
are
appointed
by
the
mother
provincial.
the
recruiting
process
of
the
lay
teachers
starts
in
the
superintendent’s
office,
and
one
of
his
assistants
interviews
all
of
the
applicants.
they
fill
out
an
application,
they
are
interviewed
by
one
of
the
superintendent’s
assistants,
and
she
refers
them
to
the
pastor
who
signs
the
contract
with
them.
it
might
be
pointed
out
that
with
respect
to
the
contract,
the
evidence
was
clear
that
as
mr.
pfeffer
pointed
out,
that
if
a
contractual
obligation,
let's
say
it
was
$6,000.00,
if
the
statute
was
held
to
unconstitutional,
the
parish
would
be
obligated
to
pay
the
total
of
the
$6,000.00.
finally,
the
principal
for
a
particular
school
will
interview
the
lay
teacher
after
they
are
refered
to
the
superintendent’s
office,
and
then
the
pastor
and
the
lay
teacher
will
sign
a
contract,
upon
agreement.
the
great
majority
of
lay
teachers
in
the
roman
catholic
schools
are
roman
catholics,
approximately
10-15%
are
not
roman
catholics.
the
schools
have
the
usual
embellishments
of
the
roman
catholic
school
and
is
testified
as
brought
out
when
one
visits
such
a
school,
he
knows
he
is
visiting
a
roman
catholic
parochial
school.
each
class,
day
starts
with
a
prayer
for
each
of
the
students.
they
are
usually
--
instead
at
the
beginning
of
the
day,
and
sometimes
at
the
end
of
day.
there
are
lay
teachers
or
religious
teachers
in
the
home
rooms,
where
these
prayers
are
said,
beginning
if
prayers
of
a
day
are
supervised,
are
conducted
either
by
lay
teachers
or
religious
teachers,
150
minutes
a
week
of
school
time
is
devoted
to
religious
classes.
this
curriculum
is
setup
in
the
handbook,
on
a
weekly
time
allotment
that
comes
out
each
year
in
september.
the
religious
classes
will
deal
with
the
study
of
the
various
tenets
of
the
roman
catholic
education.
since,
the
passage
of
the
act,
teachers
who
have
applied
for
the
supplement
do
not
teach
religious
courses,
but
prior
the
lay
teacher
could
if
they
wanted
to,
and
if
they
felt
competent.
it
would
be
up
to
the
individual
teacher,
to
determine
if
she
wants
to
begin
each
class
with
a
prayer.
one
reason
for
the
salary
supplement
act
or
i
might
point
out
that
there
are
sometimes
visiting
missionaries,
at
least
once
year,
and
of
course,
the
handbook
provides
that
the
vocations
programs
are
conducted
once
a
year.
there
was
testimony
given
by
one
nun,
who
did
apply
and
did
qualify
under
the
act,
and
she
was
asked
what
her
view
was
of
the
role
of
teachers
in
parochial
school.
she
said,
on
page
223
of
the
joint
appendix,
“according
to
the
religious
thinking
of
a
catholic
today,
it
is
that
young
adults
going
into
the
community,
they
should
hold
a
catholic
attitude
toward
different
things
they
meet
with
and
yet
this
is
not
totally
catholic,
it
is
a
christian
attitude.
as
teachers,
we
by
our
example,
particularly
and
our
handling
of
the
children
try
to
inculcate
in
them
the
same
christian
attitude.
as
with
religious,
we
are
toned
to
discipline,
and
we
try
to
exert
discipline
with
the
children,
so
they
will
be
open
to
studying
and
to
proper
attitude
toward
their
word.”
the
religious
atmosphere
that
permeates
at
the
school
is
that
of
the
teacher
themselves,
though
she
does
not
think
that
this
is
an
overall
religious
atmosphere.
one
of
the
principal
functions
of
the
parochial
school
she
said,
is
to
have
available
former
religious
training,
because
otherwise
the
children
would
not
be
reached,
except
in
the
catechetical
classes
after
school
and
if
you
do
not
get
them
at
an
early
age,
you
would
do,
if
you’ll
handled
them
right
from
the
first
grade.
father
geebung
(ph)
one
of
the
pastors
of
the
parish
schools
testified,
and
he
testified
that
pastor
entered
to
the
contracts
with
the
teachers
under
the
salary
aid,
it
is
understood
that
it
would
mean
the
salary
is
paid
by
the
parish,
would
be
that
much
less,
some
of
the
burden
will
be
taken
off
the
parish’s
shoulders.
it
is
most
fair
to
say
that
the
financial
responsibilities
of
the
parish
would
be
lessened,
if
the
supplement
payment
were
made.
the
money
saved
would
be
used
to
better
school,
but
it
could
be
spent
for
parish
purposes.
the
father
also
testified
that
he
would
not
hire
divorced
school
teachers,
nor
would
hire
ex-communicated
catholics
from
teaching
those
schools.
i
might
go
on
to
point
out
that
there
are
numerous
references
in
the
handbook's
exhibit
14,
which
relate
clearly
the
religious
atmosphere
of
the
school,
which
relate
and
show,
and
supplement
and
support
the
findings
of
the
court
below.
and
i
might
in
conclusion
say,
that
the
court
below,
the
record
that
it
found
in
making
new
findings,
that
it
did,
is
amply
supported
by
the
record.
i
respectfully
suggest
and
urge
the
court
to
affirm
the
findings
of
the
court
below,
thank
you.
