chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
number
154,
james
against
valtierra.
mr.
atkinson
i
think
you
may
proceed
now
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
mr.
cox.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
would
you
say
about
the
constitutional
provision
that
provided
that
all
public
housing
be
submitted
for
a
referendum?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
context
subsidized
by
the
federal
government
or
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
realize
that
this
hypothetical
too,
suppose
the
prohibition
or
the
referendum
requirement
were
to
all
multiple
housing
projects
over
50
units.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
with
just
--
how
would
you
shape
that
kind
of
submission
mr.
cox,
to
have
it
a
two
way
straight?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
i
was
just
trying
to
get
the
structure
of
the
submission.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
the
voters,
would
it
be
before
anything
is
done
and
would
it
be,
if
they
approved
it,
then
would
it
be
mandatory
that
they
--
that
it
be
executed,
i
assume
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
particular
place?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
cox,
i
don’t
recall
whether
yesterday
you
treated
the
question
or
the
problem
of
the
community’s
right
to
pass
on
what
amounts
to
a
discrimination
in
taxing
of
these
projects
that
is
this
project
will
not
pay
its
fair
share
of
tax
in
the
minds
and
eyes
of
this
small
home.
now,
isn’t
that
an
important
interest
to
deserve
protection
of
a
referendum?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
those
are
quite
different
categories
of
federal
government
building
obviously
(voice
overlap)?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
aren’t
they
distinguishable
and
that
they
serve
everyone?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
if
we
follow
from
your
thesis
that
a
state
could
not
submit
to
popular
referendum
the
question
of
welfare
programs
and
welfare
because
by
definition
they
are
only
for
the
poor?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then,
i
am
confused
a
little
bit
mr.
cox,
hasn’t
the
state
of
california
had
in
effect
a
town
meeting
and
made
a
constitutional
amendment
that
all
low-cost
housing
which
is
a
form
of
welfare
must
be
subjected
to
(voice
overlap)?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
distinguish
in
this
respect
between
a
constitutional
limitation
and
legislative
action
that
would
eliminate
some
type
of
welfare
program
or
subsidy
for
housing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
its
impact
would
be
entirely
the
same,
wouldn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
cox.
mr.
atkinson.
we've
enlarged
your
time
a
few
minutes
mr.
atkinson,
you'll
about
10
or
11
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes
you
have
considerable
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
atkinson.
number
154
is
submitted.
we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
226,
shaffer
against
valtierra.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh,
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thus,
for
our
purposes
we
have
this
litigate
as
separate
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
i
want
to
make
this
point
you
were
probably
in
court
yesterday
when
i
announced
earlier
prior
to
the
beginning
of
the
argument
in
154
that
mr.
justice
marshall
reserve
the
right
to
participate
in
this
case
on
the
basis
of
the
transcription
of
the
oral
arguments
and
all
the
other
papers.
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
not
sure
he
went
quite
that
far,
i
thought
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
it
would
be
a
much
different
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
saying
that
argument
presupposes
that
the
agent
has
more
power
than
the
principle?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
be
sure
i
understand
this
factual
situation.
you
say
there
is
a
no
other
type
of
public
housing
or
any
kind
of
housing
which
can
be
submitted
to
a
referendum
in
california?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
under
a
different
act
in
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
lasky.
mr.
cox.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
which
being
non-taxable,
i
may
suggest
is
more
than
$4,000.00
a
year
for
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
care
to
very
suggest
what
that
might
be
just
to
delineate?[laughter]
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it’s
the
same
case
on
a
fair
housing,
is
it
the
same
case
on
low-housing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
not
sure
you
followed
justice
harlan’s
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
may
i
alter
but
pursue
justice
harlan’s
point
to
a
more
specific
question.
suppose
the
provision
required
the
two-thirds
vote
for
any
program
for
aid
to
dependent
children
or
people
of
comparable
categories,
straight
welfare
as
we
know
the
word.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
they
subject
to
a
referendum?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
the
original
urban
renewal
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
an
expression
for
what
mr.
lasky
said
that
my
petition
it
could
be
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
difference
between
a
mandatory
and
a
petition?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
for
these
purposes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
of
course
the
state
of
california
might,
i
would
assume
might
provide
that
a
petition
referendum
could
be
initiated
by
the
signatures
of
100
registered
voters
and
that
would
be
almost
a
formality,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
middle-income
housing
involve
a
waiver
of
all
taxes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
ask
you
just
one
more
question
on
this
category
of
minorities
or
relating
to
your
classification
of
the
poor
in
purposes
of
this
case.
suppose
a
given
county
in
california,
a
small
county
had
a
bond
issue
up
for
$20
or
$30
million
to
construct
high
schools
and
it
was
subject
to
a
referendum,
which
i
gather
many
of
them
are,
would
there
be
an
equal
protection
clause
or
a
discrimination
factor
involved
because
the
principal
beneficiaries,
the
students
couldn’t
vote
and
that’s
a
fund
issue?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
students
couldn’t
vote,
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
i'm
talking
about
high
schools
now
14
to
18,
i
was
deliberately
putting
it
under
the
18
group
because
lately
we
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
cox.
thank
you
lasky.
the
case
is
submitted.
