justice

black
what
you
said
about
reitman
and
mulkey?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
just
one
question?
i
didn’t
quite
understand
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice.
suppose
california
will
submit
to
the
people
a
referendum
vote
on
whether
or
not
how
any
longer
be
used
and
to
state
a
system
of
public
relief
payable
out
of
tax
raised
funds,
did
i
understand
you
say
that
would
be
unconstitutional?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
that
takes
away
from
people
the
right
to
decide
and
determine
their
policy
(voice
overlap)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
the
point
of
view,
what's
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
the
point
of
view,
what's
fair
and
right,
i
guess?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
abolish
all
relief
and
no
attempt
issues?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
now.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn’t
think
that
our
counsel
cases
were
based
on
discrimination;
i
thought
they
were
based
on
the
constitutional
provision.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
presume
you
still
have
counties.
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
your
statute
defines
what
class
of
people
or
type
of
benefits
of
low-cost
housing.
are
the
figures
in
the
record
as
to
what
the
range
of
income
that
encompasses
among
those
who
are
eligible
to
the
procedure
(voice
overlap)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it
had
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it
had
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
this
question,
would
you
mind
stating
as
precisely
as
you
can
what
you
think
this
question
is?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
relate
entirely
to
the
referendum?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
referendum,
does
it
relate
entirely
to
the
referendum?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
total
issue,
does
it
refer
to
any
denial
of
equal
protection
and
the
way
the
law
will
operate
if
it’s
adopted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
precise
question
as
you
see
it
on
which
it
is
claimed
that
a
submission
of
this
matter
to
the
people
is
unconstitutional
as
it
unlawful
discrimination?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i’d
rather
you
just
state
it
because
i
have
heard
a
lot
of
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
difficulty
in
understanding
it
completely.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that’s
the
only
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
the
state
legislature
had
passed
alone
to
build
a
housing
project
just
exactly
as
this
one
would
have
been
built
if
the
election
should
pass
that
way
referendum,
would
there
be
any
claim
as
you
understand
it
that
that
law
denied
equal
protection?
justice
hugo
l.
black
legislature
had
pass
the
law
to
put
in
effect
precisely
the
thing
it
would
be
put
in
effect
to
some
people
vote
affirmative
year,
would
that
deny
--
is
that
argument,
is
that
for
denial
(voice
overlap).
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
would?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
it’s
not
altogether
then
on
a
fact
that
there's
a
referendum?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
trying
to
find
it
exactly
what
it
is.
i'm
not
been
able
detect
it
yet
in
either
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
has
--
what
does
the
argument
based
largest
been
based
on
a
fact
that
this
is
discrimination
against
the
poor?
justice
hugo
l.
black
whatever
the
poor
is?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don’t
exactly
know
that
they
define
the
law,
but
they
say
it’s
a
discrimination
against
the
poor.
is
the
discrimination
the
referendum?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
the
law
that
would
be
passed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
some
argument
of
course.
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
are
the
poor?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
it
is
in
the
referendum
alone?
justice
hugo
l.
black
alone?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
that
had
been
referred
to
a
county?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
stock
law
that
refers
to
a
county
all
people
do
not
own
a
stock?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn’t
think
of
that
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
stock
laws
--
county
stock
laws?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
question
is
that
suppose
you
had
state
would
it
pass
a
county
option
law
on
stock
laws
that
people
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
gather,
you're
doing
it
because
they
refer
to
the
people
the
right
to
vote
on
some
things
that
do
not
refer
on
other
things,
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.

what
do
you
mean
by
neutral
principle
that's
(voice

that's
another
expression
i
have
