mr.
moses
lasky
do
i
understand
that
i
am
or
not
am
not
to
have
an
argument?
mr.
moses
lasky
yes.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
moses
lasky
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
of
course
is
the
identical
case
of
154.
it
is
here
separately
because
of
the
belief
of
the
appellant
shaffer
who
was
one
of
the
city
councilman
of
the
city
of
san
jose
that
the
other
appellants
had
actually
appealed
not
to
get
a
reversal
but
in
order
to
get
the
stamp
of
approval
on
the
judgment
which
would
have
relieve
them
from
an
obligation
of
the
state
constitution.
now,
as
counsel
has
just
mentioned
to
you,
this
case
was
decided
on
a
summary
judgment
without
trial
on
the
most
meager
record,
affidavits
which
merely
identified
who
the
plaintiffs
were
and
some
opinion
evidenced
that
there
was
need
for
low-income
housing.
counsel
has
said
that
the
city
council
had
no
opportunity
to
prepare
objectively
it
appeared
that
the
case
was
in
fact
the
same
case
case.
the
principle
defendant
was
the
housing
authority
of
san
jose
and
the
housing
authority
is
not
only
not
an
appellant
but
it’s
filed
to
brief
in
this
court
seeking
affirmance
of
the
judgment
against
him.
the
case
was
consolidated
with
the
similar
suit,
hayes
versus
san
mateo
in
which
the
defendant
defaulted
and
did
not
contest.
in
the
brief
i
filed
in
this
court,
i
submitted
that
this
case
lack
that
immediacy
of
controversy
which
justified
the
court
acting
at
all
and
i
tried
to
express
it
in
a
combination
of
terms
of
standing,
of
rightness,
of
friendly
suits,
of
feigned
actions
and
i
think
the
principles
i
was
trying
to
express
were
more
succinctly
summed
it
up
just
10
days
are
so
in
younger
versus
harris
and
that
cluster
of
cases.
however,
i
leave
that
and
move
on
to
the
merits
of
this
case.
i
would
submit
this
is
a
stunning
case.
it
involves
two
of
the
outstanding
expressions
of
american
democracy.
one
is
the
equal
protection
clause
and
the
other
is
the
right
of
the
people
to
vote
on
matters
that
concern
them.
and
here
we
have
had
one
of
these
the
equal
protection
clause
is
used
to
destroy
the
other.
now,
that's
an
amazing
result
in
granting
if
it
be
assumed
and
decided
that
there
can
be
a
situation
in
which
the
equal
protection
clause
can
be
used
to
destroy
the
right
of
the
people
to
vote
on
any
subject
they
want.
this
is
not
that
kind
of
case
hunter
versus
erickson
which
was
in
expression
of
that
sort
of
thing
is
a
wholly
different
case
and
all
it
want
and
needs
to
do
if
the
court
please
is
to
examine
this
whole
thing
in
the
context
of
california
history
and
the
structure
of
government
and
california.
and
i
submit
that
no
one
and
that
conversant
with
california
history
and
california
structure
of
government
could’ve
made
the
argument
that
has
been
made
on
behalf
of
the
appellees.
it
has
been
somehow
intimated
that
the
mandatory
referendum
was
some
strange
and
unique
thing
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
it
is
the
first
and
original
forum
of
referendum
at
california.
the
petition
referendum
did
not
come
into
existence
until
the
time
of
governor
hiram
johnson
in
1910
but
for
120
years,
direct
democracy
has
gone
at
the
very
bone
and
marrow
of
california
government.
no
other
state
has
that
been
so
true,
there
is
not
an
election
in
california
but
what
the
pubic
votes
on
15
to
20
to
30
measures.
now,
the
leading
writer
on
the
initiative
and
referendum
in
california
and
crouch
has
written
that
the
electorate
of
this
state
has
been
costumed
to
expressing
itself
on
matters
of
state
and
local
policies
and
the
state
government
was
first
established.
now,
it’s
because
of
this
historical
fact
that
our
adversaries
have
sought
to
draw
this
distinction
between
what
they
call
the
review
or
petition
referendum
and
the
automatic
or
mandatory
referendum.
and
they
have
conceded
that
there
would
be
no
unconstitutionality
of
article
xxxiv
had
a
petition
referendum.
that
distinction
will
not
hold
--
mr.
moses
lasky
pardon
me?
mr.
moses
lasky
a
petition
referendum
rather
than
the
automatic
referendum,
i
understand
the
appellees
have
conceded
that
they
would
have
no
case.
i
understand
they
now
predicate
the
case
on
the
fact
that
on
referendum
article
xxxiv
requires
is
mandatory.
mr.
moses
lasky
well,
in
housing
authority’s
brief,
if
the
court
--
mr.
moses
lasky
well,
let
me
read
you
something
from
the
brief
of
housing
authorities
in
appellee.
it
is
this
unique
automatic
referendum
requirement
that
makes
article
xxxiv
offensive
to
equal
protection
clause.
at
least
housing
authority
has
gone
that
far.
the
automatic
referendum
is
not
unique,
california
has
had
both
kinds
of
referendum
and
the
automatic
form
is
the
older.
crouch
whom
i
referred
to
a
moment
ago
says,
three
types
of
referendum
are
found
in
sake
practice
“that
use
was
greatest
frequency
is
known
as
the
compulsory
referendum.”
this
type
is
being
used
since
the
beginning
of
state
government
in
california.
now,
examine
the
situations
in
which
the
automatic
referendum
had
been
used
and
you'll
find
they
classify
into
three
classes
that
all
constitute
one.
first,
matters
having
to
do
with
the
disposition
of
public
property;
second,
creation
of
physical
burdens
on
the
general
taxpayer;
and
third,
the
distribution
of
the
powers
of
the
sovereign
people
among
their
several
agencies.
in
short,
wherever
the
government
may
be
said
to
be
acting
upon
itself
california
has
insisted
upon
the
automatic
referendum.
counsel
yesterday
referred
to
the
city
charter
of
san
jose
about
no
park
can
be
disposed
off
without
a
mandatory
referendum.
franchises
cannot
be
granted
without
a
mandatory
referendum.
and
here,
we
have
all
three
--
disposition
of
public
property
we’re
dealing
with
the
public
does
on
our
house.
here,
we
deal
with
imposition
of
burden
on
the
general
taxpayer.
now,
there’s
been
some
contest
in
the
briefs
about
that,
but
what
happens
is
that
in
order
to
get
a
housing
low-income
housing
project,
the
city
or
the
county
must
waive
taxes
for
40
years
and
commit
itself
to
provide
all
municipal
services
and
the
calculations
have
been
that
the
contribution
of
the
city
or
county
to
that
project
is
equal
to
at
least
50%
of
the
contribution
of
the
federal
government.
and
that's
a
burden
on
the
general
taxpayer.
secondly,
it
has
to
do
public
to
disposition
of
public
property
and
it
certainly
has
to
do
with
the
distribution
of
government
powers.
and
thus,
it
will
be
as
observed
at
once
that
the
automatic
referendum
of
article
xxxiv
is
applied
to
the
very
kind
of
subject
matter
to
which
it
has
been
tradition
on
california.
now,
turn
our
attention
--
mr.
moses
lasky
yes.
mr.
moses
lasky
exactly
so
and
i’ll
come
to
that
develop
it
more
fully.
i
would
like
to
point
out
the
nature
of
the
petition
referendum
which
came
here
under
hiram
johnson.
that
has
to
do
generally
with
the
exercise
of
the
police
power
wherever
the
government
regulates
the
conduct
of
private
parties
not
themselves,
that's
what
the
petition
referendum
deals
with.
now
here,
we
have
the
situation
where
a
gap
was
discovered.
when
the
housing
act
was
first
enacted,
it
was
thought
in
california
that
projects
were
subject
to
the
automatic
referendum
relating
to
bond
issues.
and
in
1937
or
1939
the
supreme
court
of
california
said
no
and
they
did
it
upon
the
basis
that
a
housing
authority
is
not
a
city
or
county
and
the
constitution
was
cast
in
terms
of
city
or
county.
well,
this
is
another
example
where
the
words
of
the
1879
constitution
have
been
eluded
by
new
and
genius
devices.
but
the
people
of
california
were
in
trouble
because
they
thought
we
at
least
have
the
petition
referendum
that
would
apply.
and
then
on
1950,
the
supreme
court
of
california
said
no,
the
petition
referendum
doesn’t
apply
because
it
applies
to
legislative
acts
and
we
construe
this
is
administrative
or
executive.
thus,
the
people
found
they
had
no
referendum
and
with,
at
the
very
next
election
in
1950,
this
xxxiv
was
adopted.
now,
what
motivated
them?
we
have
in
the
record
the
official
ballot
arguments
in
california.
the
ballot
goes
to
the
public
or
people
with
official
arguments
and
there
it’s
in
the
record,
it’s
in
the
brief
and
if
you
read
you'll
find
it’s
all
summed
up
two
or
three
times
to
the
expression
“to
restore”
to
restore
to
the
people.
strength
in
local
self-government
can
restore
to
the
community
the
right
to
determine
its
own
future
course
“restore
to
the
citizens”
the
right
to
decide
and
they
refer
to
the
traditional
right
of
californians
to
pass
on
matters
of
this
general
character.
now
here
was
a
gap.
california
wanted
to
fill
the
gap.
it
had
two
presidents
as
to
the
type
of
referendum
it
should
adopt.
it
had
the
old
precedent
of
the
mandatory
referendum,
it
had
the
later
precedent
of
the
petition
referendum
and
it
chose
the
one
and
not
the
other
and
i
submit
there
is
nothing
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
bent
california’s
arm
and
said
you
must
adopt
the
one
instead
of
the
other
particularly
in
view
of
the
fact
that
this
situation
isn’t
keen
in
all
its
nature
to
the
thing
is
to
which
the
mandatory
referendum
was
a
characteristic.
now,
let's
ask
this
question,
was
there
any
improper
motive
in
the
adoption
of
article
xxxiv?
it
has
been
conceded
that
the
record
shows
no
such
and
i
go
further.
this
case
was
decided
among
summary
judgment
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
decided
pauler
(ph)
versus
cbs,
the
fortler
(ph)
case
that
on
summary
judgment
adverse
imputations
of
motive
can
never
be
taken.
therefore,
there
can
be
no
motive
--
no
imputation
of
an
improper
motive
in
the
adoption
of
xxxiv,
nor
can
there
be
any
imputation
of
improper
motive
of
the
voters
in
voting
on
housing
projects.
i
would
submit
that
the
very
thought
of
courts
inquiring
into
vote
or
motives
would
be
intolerable.
since
there
can
be
no
determination
of
the
improper
motive,
let's
inquire
as
to
effect.
the
record
contains
and
it
came
in
by
judicial
notice
was
offered
as
evidence
the
figures
on
votes,
on
projects
from
the
1950
to
1968
and
it’s
in
the
record
to
the
appendix
at
page
34
and
you'll
find
several
pages
showing
all
the
elections.
the
court
below
said,
well
it
showed
that
48%
of
the
units
were
turned
down,
but
what
it
showed
was
its
69%
of
the
elections
carried.
and
the
reason
there
was
a
disparity
on
the
units
was
a
monstrous
10,000
units
in
los
angeles
have
been
turned
down
the
kind
of
project
which
the
housing
authority
is
now
are
ashamed
off.
the
record
--
if
you
take
the
same
judicial
notice,
you'll
find
that
in
all
of
the
projects
voted
on
from
1968
through
1970
84%
were
carried
and
the
record
also
shows
that
of
the
11
elections
that
occurred
on
a
ballot
of
california
on
the
same
day
that
san
jose
voted
on
this
all
but
the
san
jose
carried.
now,
you
cannot
take
those
statistics
and
say
that
the
voters
of
california
had
been
using
this
law
as
a
method
of
discriminating
against
race
or
against
poverty.
the
statistics
in
the
record
are
just
the
contrary.
consequently,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
this
amazing
judgment
can
be
affirmed
and
the
federal
power
can
be
use
to
upset
the
structure
of
state
government
if
and
only
if
on
bare
comparison
of
the
face
of
article
xxxiv
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
unconstitutionality
is
absolutely
unavoidable.
now,
that’s
the
precise
kind
of
treatment
of
this
court
10
days
ago
or
eight
days
ago
in
younger
versus
harris
said
should
be
indulged
in
very
cautiously
indeed.
“for
younger
versus
harris
procedures
for
testing
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute
on
its
face
and
for
then
enjoining
all
action
to
enforce
the
statute
are
fundamentally
at
odds
with
the
function
of
the
federal
courts
in
our
constitutional
claim.”
now,
i
come
to
the
question
mr.
justice
white
that
you
put
to
me
a
few
moments
ago.
on
what
basis
is
article
xxxiv
said
to
deny
equal
protection?
who
does
it
discriminate
against
and
whom
does
it
discriminate
in
favor
of?
there
is
a
no
claim
that
it
discriminates
among
the
subjects
to
which
it
relates.
that
subject
is
low-income
housing
and
all
are
treated
alike.
there
is
a
no
claim
there
can
be
no
claim
at
california
treats
low-income
housing
differently
from
it
treats
other
housing
for
one
reason.
california
doesn’t
have
anything
but
low-income
housing.
now,
there
have
been
statements
in
the
briefs
and
then
argument
that
little
income
housing
is
favored
by
loans
from
the
federal
government,
that’s
the
federal
government.
the
federal
government
has
the
power
to
deal
directly
what
the
people
if
it
wishes
or
to
deal
through
the
states.
on
middle-income
housing,
the
federal
government
chooses
to
go
directly
to
the
people.
california
has
nothing
to
do
with
that.
on
low-income
housing,
the
federal
government
chose
to
say
to
the
state
i
offer
you
our
assistance
if
you
choose
to
take
it
and
california
says,
we
choose
to
take
it
only
on
the
vote
of
the
people.
and
so
california
treats
all
housing
it
deals
with
alike.
with
one
possible
exception
in
the
case
of
blighted
areas
under
urban
renewal
after
the
place
has
been
torn
down,
other
housing
is
possible
and
it’s
never
been
done.
it’s
never
been
done
and
if
the
time
to
talk
about
discrimination
might
arise
if
and
as
sometime
in
the
future
something
like
that
happen.
so,
what
does
the
claim
come
to?
the
claim
comes
to
this,
that
there
no
mandatory
referendum
is
required
of
some
other
kinds
of
government
activity
and
i
submit
that
this
is
no
more
at
a
claim
that
it
is
unconstitutional
to
require
a
mandatory
referendum
or
anything
unless
required
of
everything.
and
that
of
course
flies
in
the
face
of
numerous
decisions
of
this
court
including
this
court’s
decision
of
1970
in
dandridge
versus
williams
where
the
court
said
that
we
are
dealing
with
social
and
welfare
matters.
the
usual
way
of
handling
equal
protection
applies
if
you
can
--
any
rational
justification
with
the
classification
will
hold.
and
i've
given
more
than
rational
of
justification.
i
submit
i've
given
overwhelming
justification.
that
brings
me
to
hunter
versus
erickson
which
of
course
must
be
dealt
with
and
i
say
that
the
resemblance
between
this
case
and
hunter
is
the
most
superficial
thing
based
upon
mere
catchword
of
an
automatic
referendum.
and
i
say
that
hunter
once
you
get
over
hurdle
of
whether
you
can
strike
down
the
right
to
vote
at
all.
hunter
versus
erickson
was
an
obvious
case
and
for
this
reason
first
place
the
motive
in
hunter
was
racial
discrimination.
the
city
of
akron
had
an
ordinance
prohibiting
racial
discrimination
on
housing
and
the
very
purpose
of
the
charter
amendment
there
was
to
repeal
that
and
subject
racial
--
subject
legislation
about
racial
discrimination
of
the
special
treatment.
and
this
court
said
in
the
opinion
there
was
wan
explicitly
racial
classification
that
does
not
exist
here.
secondly,
akron
already
had
a
general
referendum
statute
that
was
applicable.
the
petition,
the
voters
already
had
a
voice
and
the
charter
change
that
to
make
it
more
onerous.
the
purpose
of
the
amendment
was
to
apply
to
anti-discrimination
legislation
a
different
procedure.
here,
california
had
no
voice
of
the
people
before
article
xxxiv.
it
had
to
adopt
something
and
i
come
back
to
my
statement,
it
had
a
right
to
draw
on
either
of
the
two
precedents
and
it
chose
one
and
not
the
other
and
its
choice
was
rational.
it
was
rational
not
only
because
we
were
dealing
with
the
fisc,
it
was
rational
because
we
were
dealing
with
questions
of
the
whole
environment
which
people
live.
housing
projects
can
change
that
environment
forever
and
certainly
people
ought
to
have
a
right
to
have
voice.
now,
counsel
has
said
housing
people
are
now
spreading
the
units
out
and
are
no
longer
indulging
on
a
mass
institutional
stuff
which
all
people
now
condemn.
but
for
20
years,
they
were
using
the
mass
institutional
to
housing
and
that
the
people
were
wiser
on
rejecting
projects.
they
were
wiser
than
the
experts
and
the
experts
who
just
caught
up.
now,
i'm
not
arguing
in
favor
of
one
kind
of
housing
and
another,
i
say
these
are
the
kind
of
considerations
which
justified
putting
to
the
people
who
are
the
ones
to
be
affected
a
decision
on
what
they
want.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
moses
lasky
i
think
this
court
should
order
a
dismissal
of
this
suit
entirely
and
i
think
that
if
the
--
our
opposition
wishes
to
test
this
question
further,
they
should
do
it
in
a
traditional
way.
the
housing
authority
should
either
refuse
to
issue
bonds
and
someone
should
mandamus
them
or
the
housing
authority
should
try
the
float
bonds
and
someone
should
try
to
enjoy
them,
or
it
should
try
to
float
bonds
and
then
sue
the
banks
that
refuse
to
take
them
because
of
a
lack
of
vote.
then
you
could
get
this
question
decided
in
the
context
of
a
real
controversy,
that's
my
submission
to
your
question
of
the
proper
disposition
of
this
case.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes,
the
question
before
the
court?
mr.
moses
lasky
the
question
before
the
court
here
is
whether
the
equal
protection
clause
requires
california’s
referendum
requirement
on
housing
to
be
invalidated
on
the
theory
that
somehow
it
discriminates
improperly
against
something
or
somebody.
mr.
moses
lasky
i
think
so.
mr.
moses
lasky
well,
it
relates
the
question
whether
you
can
--
the
constitutionality
of
submitting
this
court
require
these
questions
should
be
voted
on
by
the
public.
mr.
moses
lasky
no,
your
honor.
that
is
not
involved
here.
that
is
not
--
in
other
words,
--
mr.
moses
lasky
the
question
is
we
have
phrase
it
in
our
brief
(voice
overlap).
mr.
moses
lasky
the
question
is
--
mr.
moses
lasky
the
question
is
whether
the
california’s
constitutional
provision
stating
that
there
may
be
no
housing
project
without
at
first
an
affirmative
vote
of
the
people
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
that’s
the
question.
mr.
moses
lasky
sir,
that’s
the
only
question.
another
question
has
been
raised
about
the
supremacy
--
the
supremacy
clause
but
no
my
opposition
has
not
chosen
to
argue
that
so
i
don’t
see
any
need
of
discussing
at
all.
mr.
moses
lasky
do
you
mean
if
the
legislature
--
mr.
moses
lasky
i
think
that’s
implicit
in
the
argument
of
my
adversaries
if
i
understand
question,
if
the
requirements
of
article
xxxiv
were
imposed
by
state
statute?
mr.
moses
lasky
my
adversaries
would
argue
that
that’s
unconstitutional.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes.
mr.
moses
lasky
well,
i
--
mr.
moses
lasky
well,
as
i
understand
the
contention
which
was
adopted
below,
it
is
that
when
the
elected
representatives
of
the
people
whether
state
or
local
adopted
the
project
it
must
go
into
effect
and
it’s
unconstitutional
to
say
it
must
also
have
an
affirmative
vote
of
the
people.
now,
that’s
what
i
understand
the
contention
to
be,
and
as
i
understand,
the
court
below
to
have
held.
mr.
moses
lasky
exactly
so.
in
other
words,
california
has
said
we
delegate
to
our
agent
the
local
city
council
the
power
to
initiate
a
project
but
we
reserved
to
ourselves
there
were
final
word
and
we
are
being
told
that
it’s
unconstitutional
for
the
principle
to
reserve
that
because
for
soothe
in
other
matters
such
as
highways,
schools,
hospitals
that
haven’t
reserve
any
thing
except
the
petition
referendum.
now,
--
mr.
moses
lasky
yes.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes.
mr.
moses
lasky
no,
no,
they
claimed
the
discrimination
against
the
poor
is
requiring
a
referendum.
mr.
moses
lasky
that’s
what
i’ve
never
been
able
to
seek,
why?
but
their
argument
runs
like
this
--
mr.
moses
lasky
their
argument
is
that
other
people
presumably
the
rich
don’t
have
to
go
to
a
referendum.
if
someone
wants
a
highway
or
he
wants
a
hospital
or
he
wants
public
education
assistance,
he
doesn’t
need
to
do
this.
but
there's
no
discrimination
here
because
this
subject
deals
with
the
poor
poverty
is
a
sociological
and
political
and
the
economic
circumstance
that
wants
government
action.
now,
when
the
government
turns
its
attention
to
that
problem
certainly
the
state
governments
have
the
widest
discretion
as
to
how
they
should
handle
it,
how
far
they
should
go,
what
they
should
do,
what
preliminaries
necessary
before
anything
is
done.
mr.
moses
lasky
i
think
so,
in
other
words
if
we
wipe
legislative
history
clean
and
this
is
the
first
time
california
went
for
referendum.
the
question
then
would
be
must
the
states
structure
of
government
treat
everything
alike.
and
my
answer
to
that
is
this,
the
equal
protection
clause
--
mr.
moses
lasky
treating
subject
matter
is
different,
yes.
mr.
moses
lasky
but
i
can
see
the
equal
protection
--
mr.
moses
lasky
pardon?
mr.
moses
lasky
no,
we
got
what
the
court
is
being
asked
to
here
is
to
take
a
microscope
and
a
micrometer
and
to
take
the
whole
corpus
of
legislation
and
look
at
each
one
and
to
determine
how
the
differences
are
between
the
one
and
the
other.
mr.
moses
lasky
i
would
say
thoroughly
unconstitutional.
mr.
moses
lasky
why,
because
the
fourteenth
amendment
directs
its
thrust
at
racial
discrimination
and
because
the
fourteenth
amendment
has
singled
out
racial
discrimination.
mr.
moses
lasky
this
court
has
--
mr.
moses
lasky
no,
i
think
that
would
be
perfectly
constitution.
in
other
words,
if
its
--
mr.
moses
lasky
if
what?
mr.
moses
lasky
no,
i
have
taken
--
you
asked
me
a
question
that
wipeout
slate
of
california
history.
mr.
moses
lasky
and
i
even
then
i
say
it
be
constitutional.
but
if
this
court
were
to
take
that
case
if
it
went
on
the
rows
now
to
be
unconstitutional
i
would
say
you
can't
wipe
up
the
slate
of
history.
i
think
in
a
decision
your
honor
may
have
written
carter
versus
jury
commission.
it
was
remarked
that
here
was
a
device
of
ancient
vintage
and
that
it
had
not
been
used
with
any
improper
motives
and
that's
exactly
this
case
we’re
dealing
with
the
device
of
ancient
vintage
and
it
cannot
be
demonstrated
that
there's
any
improper
motive.
now,
let
me
add
one
thing
further.
to
talk
about
discrimination
of
the
poor
as
if
the
poor
was
a
group
is
to
my
respectful
submission
nonsense.
your
honor,
the
highways,
hospitals
benefit
the
whole
public.
they
benefit
the
poor
as
much
as
anybody
else.
low-income
housing
benefits
the
whole
public,
that’s
why
it
justified
constitutionally
and
to
say
that
this
forces
upon
the
poor
a
burden
is
more
nonsense
because
the
people
who
back
low-income
housing
projects
are
a
veritable
poverty,
industrial
complex
and
if
you
look
at
the
mass
of
people
who
sought
to
file
amicus
briefs
in
this
court
on
the
other
side,
you'll
find
afl-cio,
national
association
of
architects,
building
materials
manufacturers,
if
you
had
the
record
taken
in
evidence
in
this
case,
you
would
find
this
project,
the
election
more
money
was
put
up
for
then
against
and
most
of
it
was
put
up
by
tile
companies
and
unions.
mr.
moses
lasky
and
the
burden
comes
in
upon
the
fact
that
the
services,
municipal
services
have
to
be
supplied
and
taxes
are
waived
and
closest
anyone
has
been
ever
been
able
to
estimate
is
that
the
burden
on
the
california
taxpayer
is
equal
to
50%
to
60%
of
the
total
amount
of
money,
the
federal
government
itself
contributes
and
beyond
that
i
have
no
figures,
i'm
unable
to
give
them.
mr.
moses
lasky
no,
there’s
no
appropriation
of
tax
money
because
the
bonds
which
are
issued
advancely
paid
by
the
federal
government
which
supplies
the
money.
mr.
moses
lasky
california
has
no
other
kind
of
public
housing
except
low-income
housing
with
the
exception
i
mentioned
the
law
would
permit
some
when
you
restore
a
blighted
area
under
urban
renewal
and
i
think
--
mr.
moses
lasky
yes,
different
act.
and
then
under
i
think
agricultural
labor,
there’s
some
provision
about
providing
housing
for
agricultural
labor
but
this
obviously
benefits
the
poor
too.
so,
this
is
all
california
has.
now,
if
there's
discrimination
against,
there
must
be
discrimination
in
favor
of
somebody.
and
the
question
is
whom
does
this
discriminate
in
favor
off.
you
can't
find
an
answer
to
it.
it
doesn’t
discriminate
in
favor
of
anybody.
this
is
an
attack
on
a
structure
of
government
and
i
submit
that
the
equal
protection
clause
primarily
has
to
do
with
the
application
of
the
law.
it
says
the
law
shall
be
laid
--
the
lash
of
the
law
shall
be
laid
on
the
backs
of
everyone
equally,
the
privileges
of
the
law
shall
be
given
to
everybody
equally.
this
case
presents
a
different
kind
of
question
which
is,
is
the
structure
of
government
such
that
everyone
has
an
equal
opportunity
to
obtain
advantages.
now,
i
am
not
prepared
to
say
that
that
question
can
never
be
asked
but
i
do
submit
that
it
must
be
an
extraordinary
case,
an
extraordinary
case
indeed
coming
upon
record
of
evidence
that
would
justify
the
intrusion
of
the
courts
into
that
field.
and
although
my
time
has
not
expired
but
this
what
i
has,
i
submit
that
this
judgment
should
be
reversed.
mr.
moses
lasky
none,
whatever.
reitman
versus
mulkey
was
a
case
that
came
to
this
court
upon
a
construction
of
the
constitutional
provision
there
which
said
as
so
construed
that
the
right
to
discriminate
was
now
to
be
constitutionally
protected
in
california.
it
was
on
that
construction
that
i
read
this
court
decision
to
go
off.
so
i
don’t
think
reitman
versus
mulkey
has
slightest
application.
the
only
case
i
think
one
has
to
consider
here
is
hunter
versus
erickson
and
i
think
that’s
clearly
distinguishable.
mr.
moses
lasky
do
i
understand
that
i
am
or
not
am
not
to
have
an
argument?
mr.
moses
lasky
yes.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
moses
lasky
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
of
course
is
the
identical
case
of
154.
it
is
here
separately
because
of
the
belief
of
the
appellant
shaffer
who
was
one
of
the
city
councilman
of
the
city
of
san
jose
that
the
other
appellants
had
actually
appealed
not
to
get
a
reversal
but
in
order
to
get
the
stamp
of
approval
on
the
judgment
which
would
have
relieve
them
from
an
obligation
of
the
state
constitution.
now,
as
counsel
has
just
mentioned
to
you,
this
case
was
decided
on
a
summary
judgment
without
trial
on
the
most
meager
record,
affidavits
which
merely
identified
who
the
plaintiffs
were
and
some
opinion
evidenced
that
there
was
need
for
low-income
housing.
counsel
has
said
that
the
city
council
had
no
opportunity
to
prepare
objectively
it
appeared
that
the
case
was
in
fact
the
same
case
case.
the
principle
defendant
was
the
housing
authority
of
san
jose
and
the
housing
authority
is
not
only
not
an
appellant
but
it’s
filed
to
brief
in
this
court
seeking
affirmance
of
the
judgment
against
him.
the
case
was
consolidated
with
the
similar
suit,
hayes
versus
san
mateo
in
which
the
defendant
defaulted
and
did
not
contest.
in
the
brief
i
filed
in
this
court,
i
submitted
that
this
case
lack
that
immediacy
of
controversy
which
justified
the
court
acting
at
all
and
i
tried
to
express
it
in
a
combination
of
terms
of
standing,
of
rightness,
of
friendly
suits,
of
feigned
actions
and
i
think
the
principles
i
was
trying
to
express
were
more
succinctly
summed
it
up
just
10
days
are
so
in
younger
versus
harris
and
that
cluster
of
cases.
however,
i
leave
that
and
move
on
to
the
merits
of
this
case.
i
would
submit
this
is
a
stunning
case.
it
involves
two
of
the
outstanding
expressions
of
american
democracy.
one
is
the
equal
protection
clause
and
the
other
is
the
right
of
the
people
to
vote
on
matters
that
concern
them.
and
here
we
have
had
one
of
these
the
equal
protection
clause
is
used
to
destroy
the
other.
now,
that's
an
amazing
result
in
granting
if
it
be
assumed
and
decided
that
there
can
be
a
situation
in
which
the
equal
protection
clause
can
be
used
to
destroy
the
right
of
the
people
to
vote
on
any
subject
they
want.
this
is
not
that
kind
of
case
hunter
versus
erickson
which
was
in
expression
of
that
sort
of
thing
is
a
wholly
different
case
and
all
it
want
and
needs
to
do
if
the
court
please
is
to
examine
this
whole
thing
in
the
context
of
california
history
and
the
structure
of
government
and
california.
and
i
submit
that
no
one
and
that
conversant
with
california
history
and
california
structure
of
government
could’ve
made
the
argument
that
has
been
made
on
behalf
of
the
appellees.
it
has
been
somehow
intimated
that
the
mandatory
referendum
was
some
strange
and
unique
thing
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
it
is
the
first
and
original
forum
of
referendum
at
california.
the
petition
referendum
did
not
come
into
existence
until
the
time
of
governor
hiram
johnson
in
1910
but
for
120
years,
direct
democracy
has
gone
at
the
very
bone
and
marrow
of
california
government.
no
other
state
has
that
been
so
true,
there
is
not
an
election
in
california
but
what
the
pubic
votes
on
15
to
20
to
30
measures.
now,
the
leading
writer
on
the
initiative
and
referendum
in
california
and
crouch
has
written
that
the
electorate
of
this
state
has
been
costumed
to
expressing
itself
on
matters
of
state
and
local
policies
and
the
state
government
was
first
established.
now,
it’s
because
of
this
historical
fact
that
our
adversaries
have
sought
to
draw
this
distinction
between
what
they
call
the
review
or
petition
referendum
and
the
automatic
or
mandatory
referendum.
and
they
have
conceded
that
there
would
be
no
unconstitutionality
of
article
xxxiv
had
a
petition
referendum.
that
distinction
will
not
hold
--
mr.
moses
lasky
pardon
me?
mr.
moses
lasky
a
petition
referendum
rather
than
the
automatic
referendum,
i
understand
the
appellees
have
conceded
that
they
would
have
no
case.
i
understand
they
now
predicate
the
case
on
the
fact
that
on
referendum
article
xxxiv
requires
is
mandatory.
mr.
moses
lasky
well,
in
housing
authority’s
brief,
if
the
court
--
mr.
moses
lasky
well,
let
me
read
you
something
from
the
brief
of
housing
authorities
in
appellee.
it
is
this
unique
automatic
referendum
requirement
that
makes
article
xxxiv
offensive
to
equal
protection
clause.
at
least
housing
authority
has
gone
that
far.
the
automatic
referendum
is
not
unique,
california
has
had
both
kinds
of
referendum
and
the
automatic
form
is
the
older.
crouch
whom
i
referred
to
a
moment
ago
says,
three
types
of
referendum
are
found
in
sake
practice
“that
use
was
greatest
frequency
is
known
as
the
compulsory
referendum.”
this
type
is
being
used
since
the
beginning
of
state
government
in
california.
now,
examine
the
situations
in
which
the
automatic
referendum
had
been
used
and
you'll
find
they
classify
into
three
classes
that
all
constitute
one.
first,
matters
having
to
do
with
the
disposition
of
public
property;
second,
creation
of
physical
burdens
on
the
general
taxpayer;
and
third,
the
distribution
of
the
powers
of
the
sovereign
people
among
their
several
agencies.
in
short,
wherever
the
government
may
be
said
to
be
acting
upon
itself
california
has
insisted
upon
the
automatic
referendum.
counsel
yesterday
referred
to
the
city
charter
of
san
jose
about
no
park
can
be
disposed
off
without
a
mandatory
referendum.
franchises
cannot
be
granted
without
a
mandatory
referendum.
and
here,
we
have
all
three
--
disposition
of
public
property
we’re
dealing
with
the
public
does
on
our
house.
here,
we
deal
with
imposition
of
burden
on
the
general
taxpayer.
now,
there’s
been
some
contest
in
the
briefs
about
that,
but
what
happens
is
that
in
order
to
get
a
housing
low-income
housing
project,
the
city
or
the
county
must
waive
taxes
for
40
years
and
commit
itself
to
provide
all
municipal
services
and
the
calculations
have
been
that
the
contribution
of
the
city
or
county
to
that
project
is
equal
to
at
least
50%
of
the
contribution
of
the
federal
government.
and
that's
a
burden
on
the
general
taxpayer.
secondly,
it
has
to
do
public
to
disposition
of
public
property
and
it
certainly
has
to
do
with
the
distribution
of
government
powers.
and
thus,
it
will
be
as
observed
at
once
that
the
automatic
referendum
of
article
xxxiv
is
applied
to
the
very
kind
of
subject
matter
to
which
it
has
been
tradition
on
california.
now,
turn
our
attention
--
mr.
moses
lasky
yes.
mr.
moses
lasky
exactly
so
and
i’ll
come
to
that
develop
it
more
fully.
i
would
like
to
point
out
the
nature
of
the
petition
referendum
which
came
here
under
hiram
johnson.
that
has
to
do
generally
with
the
exercise
of
the
police
power
wherever
the
government
regulates
the
conduct
of
private
parties
not
themselves,
that's
what
the
petition
referendum
deals
with.
now
here,
we
have
the
situation
where
a
gap
was
discovered.
when
the
housing
act
was
first
enacted,
it
was
thought
in
california
that
projects
were
subject
to
the
automatic
referendum
relating
to
bond
issues.
and
in
1937
or
1939
the
supreme
court
of
california
said
no
and
they
did
it
upon
the
basis
that
a
housing
authority
is
not
a
city
or
county
and
the
constitution
was
cast
in
terms
of
city
or
county.
well,
this
is
another
example
where
the
words
of
the
1879
constitution
have
been
eluded
by
new
and
genius
devices.
but
the
people
of
california
were
in
trouble
because
they
thought
we
at
least
have
the
petition
referendum
that
would
apply.
and
then
on
1950,
the
supreme
court
of
california
said
no,
the
petition
referendum
doesn’t
apply
because
it
applies
to
legislative
acts
and
we
construe
this
is
administrative
or
executive.
thus,
the
people
found
they
had
no
referendum
and
with,
at
the
very
next
election
in
1950,
this
xxxiv
was
adopted.
now,
what
motivated
them?
we
have
in
the
record
the
official
ballot
arguments
in
california.
the
ballot
goes
to
the
public
or
people
with
official
arguments
and
there
it’s
in
the
record,
it’s
in
the
brief
and
if
you
read
you'll
find
it’s
all
summed
up
two
or
three
times
to
the
expression
“to
restore”
to
restore
to
the
people.
strength
in
local
self-government
can
restore
to
the
community
the
right
to
determine
its
own
future
course
“restore
to
the
citizens”
the
right
to
decide
and
they
refer
to
the
traditional
right
of
californians
to
pass
on
matters
of
this
general
character.
now
here
was
a
gap.
california
wanted
to
fill
the
gap.
it
had
two
presidents
as
to
the
type
of
referendum
it
should
adopt.
it
had
the
old
precedent
of
the
mandatory
referendum,
it
had
the
later
precedent
of
the
petition
referendum
and
it
chose
the
one
and
not
the
other
and
i
submit
there
is
nothing
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
bent
california’s
arm
and
said
you
must
adopt
the
one
instead
of
the
other
particularly
in
view
of
the
fact
that
this
situation
isn’t
keen
in
all
its
nature
to
the
thing
is
to
which
the
mandatory
referendum
was
a
characteristic.
now,
let's
ask
this
question,
was
there
any
improper
motive
in
the
adoption
of
article
xxxiv?
it
has
been
conceded
that
the
record
shows
no
such
and
i
go
further.
this
case
was
decided
among
summary
judgment
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
decided
pauler
(ph)
versus
cbs,
the
fortler
(ph)
case
that
on
summary
judgment
adverse
imputations
of
motive
can
never
be
taken.
therefore,
there
can
be
no
motive
--
no
imputation
of
an
improper
motive
in
the
adoption
of
xxxiv,
nor
can
there
be
any
imputation
of
improper
motive
of
the
voters
in
voting
on
housing
projects.
i
would
submit
that
the
very
thought
of
courts
inquiring
into
vote
or
motives
would
be
intolerable.
since
there
can
be
no
determination
of
the
improper
motive,
let's
inquire
as
to
effect.
the
record
contains
and
it
came
in
by
judicial
notice
was
offered
as
evidence
the
figures
on
votes,
on
projects
from
the
1950
to
1968
and
it’s
in
the
record
to
the
appendix
at
page
34
and
you'll
find
several
pages
showing
all
the
elections.
the
court
below
said,
well
it
showed
that
48%
of
the
units
were
turned
down,
but
what
it
showed
was
its
69%
of
the
elections
carried.
and
the
reason
there
was
a
disparity
on
the
units
was
a
monstrous
10,000
units
in
los
angeles
have
been
turned
down
the
kind
of
project
which
the
housing
authority
is
now
are
ashamed
off.
the
record
--
if
you
take
the
same
judicial
notice,
you'll
find
that
in
all
of
the
projects
voted
on
from
1968
through
1970
84%
were
carried
and
the
record
also
shows
that
of
the
11
elections
that
occurred
on
a
ballot
of
california
on
the
same
day
that
san
jose
voted
on
this
all
but
the
san
jose
carried.
now,
you
cannot
take
those
statistics
and
say
that
the
voters
of
california
had
been
using
this
law
as
a
method
of
discriminating
against
race
or
against
poverty.
the
statistics
in
the
record
are
just
the
contrary.
consequently,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
this
amazing
judgment
can
be
affirmed
and
the
federal
power
can
be
use
to
upset
the
structure
of
state
government
if
and
only
if
on
bare
comparison
of
the
face
of
article
xxxiv
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
unconstitutionality
is
absolutely
unavoidable.
now,
that’s
the
precise
kind
of
treatment
of
this
court
10
days
ago
or
eight
days
ago
in
younger
versus
harris
said
should
be
indulged
in
very
cautiously
indeed.
“for
younger
versus
harris
procedures
for
testing
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute
on
its
face
and
for
then
enjoining
all
action
to
enforce
the
statute
are
fundamentally
at
odds
with
the
function
of
the
federal
courts
in
our
constitutional
claim.”
now,
i
come
to
the
question
mr.
justice
white
that
you
put
to
me
a
few
moments
ago.
on
what
basis
is
article
xxxiv
said
to
deny
equal
protection?
who
does
it
discriminate
against
and
whom
does
it
discriminate
in
favor
of?
there
is
a
no
claim
that
it
discriminates
among
the
subjects
to
which
it
relates.
that
subject
is
low-income
housing
and
all
are
treated
alike.
there
is
a
no
claim
there
can
be
no
claim
at
california
treats
low-income
housing
differently
from
it
treats
other
housing
for
one
reason.
california
doesn’t
have
anything
but
low-income
housing.
now,
there
have
been
statements
in
the
briefs
and
then
argument
that
little
income
housing
is
favored
by
loans
from
the
federal
government,
that’s
the
federal
government.
the
federal
government
has
the
power
to
deal
directly
what
the
people
if
it
wishes
or
to
deal
through
the
states.
on
middle-income
housing,
the
federal
government
chooses
to
go
directly
to
the
people.
california
has
nothing
to
do
with
that.
on
low-income
housing,
the
federal
government
chose
to
say
to
the
state
i
offer
you
our
assistance
if
you
choose
to
take
it
and
california
says,
we
choose
to
take
it
only
on
the
vote
of
the
people.
and
so
california
treats
all
housing
it
deals
with
alike.
with
one
possible
exception
in
the
case
of
blighted
areas
under
urban
renewal
after
the
place
has
been
torn
down,
other
housing
is
possible
and
it’s
never
been
done.
it’s
never
been
done
and
if
the
time
to
talk
about
discrimination
might
arise
if
and
as
sometime
in
the
future
something
like
that
happen.
so,
what
does
the
claim
come
to?
the
claim
comes
to
this,
that
there
no
mandatory
referendum
is
required
of
some
other
kinds
of
government
activity
and
i
submit
that
this
is
no
more
at
a
claim
that
it
is
unconstitutional
to
require
a
mandatory
referendum
or
anything
unless
required
of
everything.
and
that
of
course
flies
in
the
face
of
numerous
decisions
of
this
court
including
this
court’s
decision
of
1970
in
dandridge
versus
williams
where
the
court
said
that
we
are
dealing
with
social
and
welfare
matters.
the
usual
way
of
handling
equal
protection
applies
if
you
can
--
any
rational
justification
with
the
classification
will
hold.
and
i've
given
more
than
rational
of
justification.
i
submit
i've
given
overwhelming
justification.
that
brings
me
to
hunter
versus
erickson
which
of
course
must
be
dealt
with
and
i
say
that
the
resemblance
between
this
case
and
hunter
is
the
most
superficial
thing
based
upon
mere
catchword
of
an
automatic
referendum.
and
i
say
that
hunter
once
you
get
over
hurdle
of
whether
you
can
strike
down
the
right
to
vote
at
all.
hunter
versus
erickson
was
an
obvious
case
and
for
this
reason
first
place
the
motive
in
hunter
was
racial
discrimination.
the
city
of
akron
had
an
ordinance
prohibiting
racial
discrimination
on
housing
and
the
very
purpose
of
the
charter
amendment
there
was
to
repeal
that
and
subject
racial
--
subject
legislation
about
racial
discrimination
of
the
special
treatment.
and
this
court
said
in
the
opinion
there
was
wan
explicitly
racial
classification
that
does
not
exist
here.
secondly,
akron
already
had
a
general
referendum
statute
that
was
applicable.
the
petition,
the
voters
already
had
a
voice
and
the
charter
change
that
to
make
it
more
onerous.
the
purpose
of
the
amendment
was
to
apply
to
anti-discrimination
legislation
a
different
procedure.
here,
california
had
no
voice
of
the
people
before
article
xxxiv.
it
had
to
adopt
something
and
i
come
back
to
my
statement,
it
had
a
right
to
draw
on
either
of
the
two
precedents
and
it
chose
one
and
not
the
other
and
its
choice
was
rational.
it
was
rational
not
only
because
we
were
dealing
with
the
fisc,
it
was
rational
because
we
were
dealing
with
questions
of
the
whole
environment
which
people
live.
housing
projects
can
change
that
environment
forever
and
certainly
people
ought
to
have
a
right
to
have
voice.
now,
counsel
has
said
housing
people
are
now
spreading
the
units
out
and
are
no
longer
indulging
on
a
mass
institutional
stuff
which
all
people
now
condemn.
but
for
20
years,
they
were
using
the
mass
institutional
to
housing
and
that
the
people
were
wiser
on
rejecting
projects.
they
were
wiser
than
the
experts
and
the
experts
who
just
caught
up.
now,
i'm
not
arguing
in
favor
of
one
kind
of
housing
and
another,
i
say
these
are
the
kind
of
considerations
which
justified
putting
to
the
people
who
are
the
ones
to
be
affected
a
decision
on
what
they
want.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
moses
lasky
i
think
this
court
should
order
a
dismissal
of
this
suit
entirely
and
i
think
that
if
the
--
our
opposition
wishes
to
test
this
question
further,
they
should
do
it
in
a
traditional
way.
the
housing
authority
should
either
refuse
to
issue
bonds
and
someone
should
mandamus
them
or
the
housing
authority
should
try
the
float
bonds
and
someone
should
try
to
enjoy
them,
or
it
should
try
to
float
bonds
and
then
sue
the
banks
that
refuse
to
take
them
because
of
a
lack
of
vote.
then
you
could
get
this
question
decided
in
the
context
of
a
real
controversy,
that's
my
submission
to
your
question
of
the
proper
disposition
of
this
case.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes,
the
question
before
the
court?
mr.
moses
lasky
the
question
before
the
court
here
is
whether
the
equal
protection
clause
requires
california’s
referendum
requirement
on
housing
to
be
invalidated
on
the
theory
that
somehow
it
discriminates
improperly
against
something
or
somebody.
mr.
moses
lasky
i
think
so.
mr.
moses
lasky
well,
it
relates
the
question
whether
you
can
--
the
constitutionality
of
submitting
this
court
require
these
questions
should
be
voted
on
by
the
public.
mr.
moses
lasky
no,
your
honor.
that
is
not
involved
here.
that
is
not
--
in
other
words,
--
mr.
moses
lasky
the
question
is
we
have
phrase
it
in
our
brief
(voice
overlap).
mr.
moses
lasky
the
question
is
--
mr.
moses
lasky
the
question
is
whether
the
california’s
constitutional
provision
stating
that
there
may
be
no
housing
project
without
at
first
an
affirmative
vote
of
the
people
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
that’s
the
question.
mr.
moses
lasky
sir,
that’s
the
only
question.
another
question
has
been
raised
about
the
supremacy
--
the
supremacy
clause
but
no
my
opposition
has
not
chosen
to
argue
that
so
i
don’t
see
any
need
of
discussing
at
all.
mr.
moses
lasky
do
you
mean
if
the
legislature
--
mr.
moses
lasky
i
think
that’s
implicit
in
the
argument
of
my
adversaries
if
i
understand
question,
if
the
requirements
of
article
xxxiv
were
imposed
by
state
statute?
mr.
moses
lasky
my
adversaries
would
argue
that
that’s
unconstitutional.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes.
mr.
moses
lasky
well,
i
--
mr.
moses
lasky
well,
as
i
understand
the
contention
which
was
adopted
below,
it
is
that
when
the
elected
representatives
of
the
people
whether
state
or
local
adopted
the
project
it
must
go
into
effect
and
it’s
unconstitutional
to
say
it
must
also
have
an
affirmative
vote
of
the
people.
now,
that’s
what
i
understand
the
contention
to
be,
and
as
i
understand,
the
court
below
to
have
held.
mr.
moses
lasky
exactly
so.
in
other
words,
california
has
said
we
delegate
to
our
agent
the
local
city
council
the
power
to
initiate
a
project
but
we
reserved
to
ourselves
there
were
final
word
and
we
are
being
told
that
it’s
unconstitutional
for
the
principle
to
reserve
that
because
for
soothe
in
other
matters
such
as
highways,
schools,
hospitals
that
haven’t
reserve
any
thing
except
the
petition
referendum.
now,
--
mr.
moses
lasky
yes.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes.
mr.
moses
lasky
no,
no,
they
claimed
the
discrimination
against
the
poor
is
requiring
a
referendum.
mr.
moses

that’s
what
i’ve
never
been
able
to
seek,
why?
but
their
argument
runs
like
this
--
mr.
moses
lasky
their
argument
is
that
other
people
presumably
the
rich
don’t
have
to
go
to
a
referendum.
if
someone
wants
a
highway
or
he
wants
a
hospital
or
he
wants
public
education
assistance,
he
doesn’t
need
to
do
this.
but
there's
no
discrimination
here
because
this
subject
deals
with
the
poor
poverty
is
a
sociological
and
political
and
the
economic
circumstance
that
wants
government
action.
now,
when
the
government
turns
its
attention
to
that
problem
certainly
the
state
governments
have
the
widest
discretion
as
to
how
they
should
handle
it,
how
far
they
should
go,
what
they
should
do,
what
preliminaries
necessary
before
anything
is
done.
mr.
moses
lasky
i
think
so,
in
other
words
if
we
wipe
legislative
history
clean
and
this
is
the
first
time
california
went
for
referendum.
the
question
then
would
be
must
the
states
structure
of
government
treat
everything
alike.
and
my
answer
to
that
is
this,
the
equal
protection
clause
--
mr.
moses
lasky
treating
subject
matter
is
different,
yes.
mr.
moses
lasky
but
i
can
see
the
equal
protection
--
mr.
moses
lasky
pardon?
mr.
moses
lasky
no,
we
got
what
the
court
is
being
asked
to
here
is
to
take
a
microscope
and
a
micrometer
and
to
take
the
whole
corpus
of
legislation
and
look
at
each
one
and
to
determine
how
the
differences
are
between
the
one
and
the
other.
mr.
moses
lasky
i
would
say
thoroughly
unconstitutional.
mr.
moses
lasky
why,
because
the
fourteenth
amendment
directs
its
thrust
at
racial
discrimination
and
because
the
fourteenth
amendment
has
singled
out
racial
discrimination.
mr.
moses
lasky
this
court
has
--
mr.
moses
lasky
no,
i
think
that
would
be
perfectly
constitution.
in
other
words,
if
its
--
mr.
moses
lasky
if
what?
mr.
moses
lasky
no,
i
have
taken
--
you
asked
me
a
question
that
wipeout
slate
of
california
history.
mr.
moses
lasky
and
i
even
then
i
say
it
be
constitutional.
but
if
this
court
were
to
take
that
case
if
it
went
on
the
rows
now
to
be
unconstitutional
i
would
say
you
can't
wipe
up
the
slate
of
history.
i
think
in
a
decision
your
honor
may
have
written
carter
versus
jury
commission.
it
was
remarked
that
here
was
a
device
of
ancient
vintage
and
that
it
had
not
been
used
with
any
improper
motives
and
that's
exactly
this
case
we’re
dealing
with
the
device
of
ancient
vintage
and
it
cannot
be
demonstrated
that
there's
any
improper
motive.
now,
let
me
add
one
thing
further.
to
talk
about
discrimination
of
the
poor
as
if
the
poor
was
a
group
is
to
my
respectful
submission
nonsense.
your
honor,
the
highways,
hospitals
benefit
the
whole
public.
they
benefit
the
poor
as
much
as
anybody
else.
low-income
housing
benefits
the
whole
public,
that’s
why
it
justified
constitutionally
and
to
say
that
this
forces
upon
the
poor
a
burden
is
more
nonsense
because
the
people
who
back
low-income
housing
projects
are
a
veritable
poverty,
industrial
complex
and
if
you
look
at
the
mass
of
people
who
sought
to
file
amicus
briefs
in
this
court
on
the
other
side,
you'll
find
afl-cio,
national
association
of
architects,
building
materials
manufacturers,
if
you
had
the
record
taken
in
evidence
in
this
case,
you
would
find
this
project,
the
election
more
money
was
put
up
for
then
against
and
most
of
it
was
put
up
by
tile
companies
and
unions.
mr.
moses
lasky
and
the
burden
comes
in
upon
the
fact
that
the
services,
municipal
services
have
to
be
supplied
and
taxes
are
waived
and
closest
anyone
has
been
ever
been
able
to
estimate
is
that
the
burden
on
the
california
taxpayer
is
equal
to
50%
to
60%
of
the
total
amount
of
money,
the
federal
government
itself
contributes
and
beyond
that
i
have
no
figures,
i'm
unable
to
give
them.
mr.
moses
lasky
no,
there’s
no
appropriation
of
tax
money
because
the
bonds
which
are
issued
advancely
paid
by
the
federal
government
which
supplies
the
money.
mr.
moses
lasky
california
has
no
other
kind
of
public
housing
except
low-income
housing
with
the
exception
i
mentioned
the
law
would
permit
some
when
you
restore
a
blighted
area
under
urban
renewal
and
i
think
--
mr.
moses
lasky
yes,
different
act.
and
then
under
i
think
agricultural
labor,
there’s
some
provision
about
providing
housing
for
agricultural
labor
but
this
obviously
benefits
the
poor
too.
so,
this
is
all
california
has.
now,
if
there's
discrimination
against,
there
must
be
discrimination
in
favor
of
somebody.
and
the
question
is
whom
does
this
discriminate
in
favor
off.
you
can't
find
an
answer
to
it.
it
doesn’t
discriminate
in
favor
of
anybody.
this
is
an
attack
on
a
structure
of
government
and
i
submit
that
the
equal
protection
clause
primarily
has
to
do
with
the
application
of
the
law.
it
says
the
law
shall
be
laid
--
the
lash
of
the
law
shall
be
laid
on
the
backs
of
everyone
equally,
the
privileges
of
the
law
shall
be
given
to
everybody
equally.
this
case
presents
a
different
kind
of
question
which
is,
is
the
structure
of
government
such
that
everyone
has
an
equal
opportunity
to
obtain
advantages.
now,
i
am
not
prepared
to
say
that
that
question
can
never
be
asked
but
i
do
submit
that
it
must
be
an
extraordinary
case,
an
extraordinary
case
indeed
coming
upon
record
of
evidence
that
would
justify
the
intrusion
of
the
courts
into
that
field.
and
although
my
time
has
not
expired
but
this
what
i
has,
i
submit
that
this
judgment
should
be
reversed.
mr.
moses
lasky
none,
whatever.
reitman
versus
mulkey
was
a
case
that
came
to
this
court
upon
a
construction
of
the
constitutional
provision
there
which
said
as
so
construed
that
the
right
to
discriminate
was
now
to
be
constitutionally
protected
in
california.
it
was
on
that
construction
that
i
read
this
court
decision
to
go
off.
so
i
don’t
think
reitman
versus
mulkey
has
slightest
application.
the
only
case
i
think
one
has
to
consider
here
is
hunter
versus
erickson
and
i
think
that’s
clearly
distinguishable.
