suppose
this
went
through
the
states(inaudible)
the
supreme
court
might
state
that
about
the

it’s
never
been

in

if
the

10%,
then
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
there
any
evidence
in
this
case
if
this
was
racially
motivated?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
have
instances
in
california
where
or
under
your
constitution
laws
certain
types
of
proposition
to
where
a
more
than

will

justice
john

california
i
suppose
could
be
used
in
relation
to
the
federal
fair
housing
act.
justice
john
m.
harlan
no
federal
compulsion
so
it
has
to
accept
the
aid.
justice

how
limited
merely
these

justice
john
m.
harlan
if
you
were
to
prevail
in
this
case
what
disposition
do
you
think
this
court
should
mandate?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
really
go
that
far
to
say
this
case
is
controlled
hunter
and
erickson?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it’s
also
a
considerable
other
difference,
i
would
say
at
park
mechanics,
i
should
think.
you
know
how
the
case
is
but
you
keep
talking
about
the
word
“poor”?
do
you
know
of
any
cases
which
that
characterization
on
an
equal
protection
case
is
referring
to
other
than
indigence
that
goes
technical
sense
in
there?
what
are
the
cases
that
you
think
of?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
think
in
harper
against
virginia,
the
polling
tax
case’s
rhetorical
language.
but
give
me
another
case
where
the
word
“poor”
which
is
the
premise
of
your
argument
has
been
held
to
include
people
whose
income
as
by
your
own
statement,
$4,000.00
a
year.
justice
john
m.
harlan
sorry.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
was
your
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question,
mr.
cox?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
would
you
say
about
a
california
statute,
you
said
all
social
welfare
like
decision
that
would
be
submitted
would
appear
to
one
of
the
legislature?
justice
john
m.
harlan
deliberately,
but
that
it
seems
to
me
the
term
is
more
after
your
classification
of
poor
than
as
to
what
i’ve
always
understood
the
equal
protection
classification
to
employment.
justice
john
m.

take
it
the

when
