mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
comes
to
the
court
on
appeal
from
a
three-judge
court
sitting
in
california
united
states
district
court,
northern
district
of
california.
the
matter
comes
up
from
a
summary
judgment.
the
summary
was
in
two
parts.
the
first
part
was
a
declaratory
judgment
ruling
at
article
xxxiv
of
the
state
of
california
constitution
was
violative
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
equal
protection
clause.
the
second
part
was
a
declaratory
judgment
--
pardon
me,
in
permanent
injunction
against
the
defendants
in
the
case
of
availing
themselves
or
relying
on
the
provisions
article
xxxiv
as
a
reason
for
not
proceeding
with
the
acquisition
construction
or
development
of
low
rent
housing.
the
supreme
court
has
jurisdiction
of
this
case
under
28
u.s.c.
1253
in
appeal
from
a
permanent
injunction
by
a
three-judge
court
against
the
enforcement
of
or
obedience
to
the
provisions
of
a
state
constitution
of
provision.
the
cases
before
the
court
are
really
two.
the
first
is
james
versus
valtierra
and
the
second
is
haze
versus
the
housing
authority.
in
the
first
case,
the
plaintiffs
valtierre
and
other
similarly
situated
on
behalf
of
the
class,
people
who
were
eligible
for
a
low
rent
housing
brought
an
action
against
the
members
of
the
city
council
of
the
city
san
jose
to
have
the
article
xxxiv
rule
to
be
unconstitutional.
in
haze
versus
housing
authority
and
also
in
that
action
that
joined
as
defendants
where
the
members
of
the
housing
authority
of
the
city
of
san
jose.
in
haze
versus
the
housing
authority
plaintiffs,
plaintiff
gutsy
haze
(ph)
and
other
similarly
situated
brought
the
same
type
of
action
against
the
housing
authority
of
san
mateo
county.
in
the
james
case,
an
answer
was
filed,
in
the
haze
case
an
answer
was
not
filed.
the
actions
were
consolidated
for
purposes
of
argument
and
the
decision
obtains
as
to
both
cases.
the
provisions
of
article
xxxiv
which
are
at
issue
before
the
court
basically
provide
that
no
state
public
body
shall
acquire,
construct
or
develop
low
rent
housing
unless
the
majority
of
the
people,
the
electors
qualify
to
vote
in
the
locality
in
which
the
low
rent
housing
is
to
be
constructed
by
majority
vote
in
favor
of
such
low
rent
housing.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
yes.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
the
purpose
of
article
xxxiv
justice
blackmun
was
to
fill
a
gap
in
the
referendum
procedure
in
california.
under
article
4
of
the
state
of
california
constitution,
only
legislative
actions
were
referendable.
an
opinion
of
the
state
supreme
court,
housing
authority
versus
the
superior
court
of
humble
county
in
1950
ruled
that
actions
of
a
housing
authority
operating
under
the
low
rent
housing
procedure
were
administrative
rather
than
legislative
in
character
and
therefore
could
not
be
reached
by
a
referendum.
shortly
thereafter
in
1950,
proposition
10
was
placed
before
the
voters
of
the
state
of
california.
that
proposition
is
and
was
adopted
as
article
xxxiv
so
that
in
response
to
your
question,
the
immediate
purpose
of
article
xxxiv
was
to
protect
the
people,
to
give
the
people
the
right
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
wanted
to
extend
low
rent
housing
to
the
people
in
their
particular
area.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
mr.
justice
white
it
depends
on
what
referendum
procedure
you
were
talking
about.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
yes,
under
that
type
--
since
that
was
the
original
type
of
referendum
that
the
people
thought
they
had
in
that
area.
it
was
to
fill
that
gap.
however
i
might
point
out
--
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
well,
it’s
a
prior
automatic
referendum
that’s
what
the
--
you’re
referring
too.
as
distinguished
--
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
no,
no,
basically
most
legislative
acts
are
subject
to
referendum
by
petition.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
a
subsequent
--
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
no
it
does
not.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
that’s
correct.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
i
wouldn’t
think
so,
there
wouldn’t
have
been
any
reason
for
--
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
of
course
i
can’t
really
answer
that
question
because
i
had
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
drafting
the
article.
i
can
only
surmise
that
the
people
thought
that
this
was
a
legitimate
approach
to
protect
their
rights
in
a
referendum
area
and
i
was
attempting
to
point
out.
there
are
other
types
of
referenda
in
california
which
are
prior
automatic
referenda.
there
are
some,
the
initiative
measure,
there
are
certain
type
of
annexation
and
consolidation
procedures.
the
city
charter
of
san
jose
with
which
i’m
quite
acquainted
has
a
provision
for
a
prior
automatic
referendum
of
the
area
of
sailing
parks.
and
there
are
other
types
of
prior
automatic
referenda,
but
i
don’t
feel
that
merely
because
we
have
a
prior
automatic
referenda
that
that
of
itself
lends
any
odious
color
to
the
procedure.
the
people
as
long
as
they’re
dealing
in
an
area
where
they
have
the
right
to
reserve
something,
as
long
they
treat
the
area
that
they
reserve
uniformly
and
without
treating
any
other
similar
area
in
a
different
manner.
i
feel
there’s
no
unconstitutional
treatment.
the
classification
here
in
article
xxxiv
is
precisely
limited
to
one
small
area,
low
rent
housing.
it
deals
with
that
area
because
i
point
it
out
before
that
was
the
area
that
the
supreme
court
of
california
ruled
was
not
referendable.
so
that
it
certainly
made
sense
for
the
people
to
strike
out
and
to
pick
out
that
precise
area
as
the
subject
of
their
referenda
procedure.
the
proposition
10
itself
when
it
was
passed,
the
arguments
pro
and
con
are
absolutely
neutral.
they’re
all
directed
to
the
right
of
the
people
to
reserve
their
voice
in
area
where
they
have
a
concern.
there’s
no
illusion
to
race,
there’s
no
illusion
to
a
property
per
se.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
no,
mr.
justice
harlan
it
has
not.
it’s
our
contention
that
the
article
is
--
as
i
pointed
out
before,
fills
the
gap
that
it’s
not
an
unconstitutional
classification.
it’s
not
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
its
not
unconstitutional
as
applied,
it’s
not
a
classification
based
on
race
nor
color,
and
it
does
not
violate
the
supremacy
clause.
in
the
first
place,
the
article
merely
deals
with
low
rent
housing
and
nothing
else.
it
treats
everyone
in
the
area
of
low
rent
housing
the
same.
and
as
such,
it
meets
the
tests
that
have
been
uniformly
laid
down
with
reference
to
the
test
that
the
court
applies
in
determining
whether
or
not
state
legislative
action
is
violative
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
the
case
of
the
hunter
versus
erickson
was
cited
as
a
precedent
in
the
lower
court.
and
i
submit
that
hunter
versus
erickson
on
its
facts
is
not
this
case
at
all.
in
hunter
versus
erickson,
we
were
dealing
with
the
situation
where
the
people
of
akron
had
a
referendum
procedure
with
right
across
the
board.
they
also
had
a
fear
housing
ordinance
which
had
a
procedure
set
up.
people
had
been
hired,
categories
had
been
established
and
it
was
actually
under
operation.
the
enactment
of
the
referendum
procedure
in
the
hunter
case
in
effect,
resented
or
repealed
the
existing
low
rent
housing
ordinance,
fair
housing
ordinance
and
built
a
prior
referendum
procedure
on
top
of
a
regular
referendum
procedure.
so
that
in
hunter,
it
could
not
have
been
argued
that
there
was
--
that
there
was
no
referenda
procedure
available
and
that
therefore
a
new
referendum
procedure
was
necessary.
secondly,
the
court
in
hunter
specifically
mentions
the
background
of
the
referenda
procedure.
the
fact
that
it
repealed
an
existing
fair
housing
ordinance,
the
fact
it
was
racially
motivated.
in
fact
in
the
opinion,
there
are
references
that
is
inexplicitly
racial
classification.
in
fact
mr.
justice
harlan
and
stewart
as
i
recall
in
their
concurring
opinion
indicated
that
the
provision
has
the
clear
purpose
of
making
it
more
difficult
for
racial
and
racial
minorities,
religious
and
racial
minorities
to
achieve
legislation
that
is
in
their
interest.
so,
i
submit
that
the
case
before
you
now
is
not
the
hunter
case
and
the
hunter
case
should
be
distinguished.
and
to
apply
the
hunter
case
here
seems
to
me
to
be
placing
the
court
as
a
super
legislative
body,
second
guessing
the
people
in
dealing
in
legislative
areas,
social
concern
areas
that
the
court
in
the
dandridge
versus
williams
said
was
their
right.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
reitman
and
mulkey
was
a
case
again
where
the
state
supreme
court
of
california
had
indicated
that
we
had
racial
discrimination
here
on
a
statewide
basis.
the
state
had
entered
the
field.
it
had
not
only
courage
but
actually
almost
put
forth
a
racial
discrimination.
the
supreme
court
as
i
recall
in
the
mulkey
case
took
the
finding
of
the
california
supreme
court
and
made
it
its
own
and
went
on
from
there.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
it’s
certainly
possible.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
it’s
never
been
before
the
california
supreme
court.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
it’s
never
been
in
any
california
court,
that’s
true.
the
--
as
i
indicated
before,
it’s
not
discriminatory
on
its
face.
there
is
no
racial
classification
in
the
constitutional
provision.
race
is
not
even
mentioned.
the
appellees
here
indicate
well,
we
know
as
matter
of
fact
that
most
of
the
poor
people
are
black
or
spanish
speaking
etcetera.
i
submit
that
this
may
or
may
not
be
true.
however,
this
does
not
per
se
make
a
statute
or
a
constitutional
provision
which
affects
a
minority.
it
doesn’t
make
it
into
a
racial
classification.
as
matter
of
fact,
i’m
sure
that
we’ll
find
that
as
far
as
numbers
go,
there
are
more
poor
whites
than
poor
blacks.
but
that
really
is
not
relevant,
i
don’t
feel
the
issues
here.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
reitman
versus
--
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
reitman
versus
mulkey
is
quite
distinguishable
in
this
regard
and
very
like
hunter.
reitman
versus
mulkey
again
repealed
a
fair
housing
procedure,
a
non
discriminatory
procedure
which
had
been
setup
in
the
state
of
california.
the
court
goes
into
the
background
and
the
purpose
and
certainly
the
court
was
very,
very
interested
in
that
just
as
it
was
in
the
hunter
case.
there’s
nothing
of
this
sort
in
the
case
before
court
now.
there’s
nothing
in
the
arguments
pro
and
con
as
i
said
before
if
it’s
right
into
the
context
of
the
necessity
of
a
referendum
procedure.
the
only
conceivable
argument
it
seems
to
me
that
can
be
race
against
the
constitutional
(inaudible)
of
34,
is
a
fact
that
it’s
a
prior
automatic
referendum
as
distinguished
from
a
subsequent
petition
referendum.
and
i
submit
that
that
is
not
crucial
because
they’re
both
referendum
procedures.
this
is
an
area
where
the
state
has
a
legitimate
concern
and
the
court
should
not
intrude
its
own
judgment
in
place
of
the
legitimate
concerns
of
a
state
people.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
the
state
interests
here
are
both
physical
and
the
fact
low
rent
housing
per
se
maybe
that.
the
physical
considerations
flow
from
the
fact
that
under
the
low
cost
housing
procedure,
the
local
public
body
takes
the
property
which
is
the
low
rent
housing
project
of
the
tax
rules
in
return
for
10%
of
the
rents.
now
that
means
that
also
the
people
are
required
to
provide
certain
municipal
or
county
or
what
have
you
--
what
ever
level
of
government
that
we’re
dealing
with
services
for
the
project,
including
possibly
schools,
parks,
and
the
improvements
of
that
nature
which
they
wouldn’t
normally
have
to
provide
if
the
low
rent
housing
project
did
not
go
in
a
particular
area.
the
other
consideration
is
the
fact
that
low
rent
housing
is
not
a
blessing
right
across
the
board.
the
experts
in
low
rent
housing
disagree
among
themselves
as
to
whether
not
as
good
or
bad.
they’re
all
kinds’
arguments
about
how
large
the
housing
should
be,
when
it
should
be
acquired
constructed
and
developed.
when
it
should
be
and
questions
of
that
nature.
in
fact,
there
has
been
some
history
here.
i
point
out
the
housing
project
in
saint
louis
which
was
an
absolute
fiasco.
in
the
past,
most
of
these
housing
projects
have
been
mandate
nature.
they
have
let
actually
to
internal
segregation.
they
let
to
isolation,
get
a
isolation
and
some
of
them
have
as
i
say
fallen
flat
on
their
face.
as
i
recall
in
saint
louis,
over
50%
of
that
project
is
now
vacant.
realizing
that
the
people
are
only
getting
back
10%
of
the
rents
in
return
for
taking
property
which
might
be
extremely
valuable
in
terms
of
tax
return
off
the
rules.
if
a
projects
fails,
the
people
certainly
should
have
the
right
to
consider
that
aspect
before
they
want
a
low
cost
housing
project
to
go
in
anywhere.
because
10%
of
a
project,
100%
filled
full,
is
certainly
not
the
same
as
10%
of
the
rents
of
the
project
only
40%
or
50%
full.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
there
have
been
a
--
i
don’t
have
the
exact
number
justice
harlan
but
i
will
point
this
out.
that
brings
up
a
very
interesting
area
up
for
discussion.
actually,
34
has
not
been
discriminatory
as
applied.
as
a
matter
of
fact
most
of
the
elections
have
been
voted
in
favor
of
the
low
rent
housing.
the
reason
that
it’s
even
close
in
terms
of
units
is
because
in
los
angeles
as
i
recall
in
1952,
a
10,000
unit
low
cost
housing
project
was
turned
down.
but
as
i
understand
it,
that
was
never
resubmitted
to
the
people.
there’s
nothing
in
34
that
prohibits
low
cost
housing
from
going
in.
it
merely
requires
a
vote.
and
i
submit
that
it’s
any
different
from
any
type
of
vote,
school
bond
or
what
have
you.
if
that
is
turned
down,
the
people
still
have
the
right
to
come
back.
the
city
council
can
again
put
up
before
the
people
and
perhaps
that’s
a
blessing.
if
there’s
something
wrong
with
the
project
that
gives
everybody
an
opportunity
to
come
back
and
think
about
it.
it
may
have
been
poorly
planned,
the
education
of
the
electorate
may
not
have
been
proper.
that
people
just
--
that
the
proponents
may
not
have
done
their
homework.
and
i
submit
that
it’s
quite
interesting
that
as
i
recall
between
1968
and
1970,
the
percentage
of
referenda
that
had
been
approved
are
actually
going
up
not
down
so
that
we
are
not
dealing
in
an
area
where
discrimination
is
running
rampant.
i
also
want
to
touch
upon
points
that
were
brought
up
in
the
appellees
brief,
they
attempt
to
bring
in
this
whole
classification
into
invidious
classification,
suspect
classification,
classifications
that
are
traditionally
disfavored.
and
i
submit
that
this
is
not
the
kind
of
a
classification
which
fits
any
of
those
tests.
most
of
the
cases
were
the
--
the
harper
case
for
example,
which
mentioned
that
wealth
and
race
were
suspect
classifications.
the
question
of
wealth
really
was
not
relevant
to
that
case
at
all.
the
only
reason
it
was
important
was
because
people
who
were
poor
were
being
deprived
of
the
right
to
vote.
and
the
right
to
vote
is
a
fundamentally
constitutionally
guaranteed
right.
and
unless
the
court
here
is
willing
to
extend
its
tests
of
fundamentally
guaranteed
rights
to
low
rent
housing,
i
think
it
would
be
extremely
dangerous
to
uphold
the
district
court
in
this
area.
neither
is
this
case,
a
criminal
case
where
someone
is
asking
for
the
right
of
a
transcript
on
appeal
or
anything
like
that.
i
submit
that
this
article
xxxiv
is
neutral
in
purpose,
completely
undiscriminatory
in
its
face
and
as
applied.
and
i
submit
that
again
that
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
the
court
launches
out
in
this
area
and
strikes
down
34,
it
would
seem
rather
difficult
to
determine
where
the
line
will
be
drawn.
if
a
provisional
constitutional
provision
like
this
can
be
stricken
down
by
this
court,
there’s
no
end
to
the
intrusion
of
the
judiciary
into
the
legitimate
concerns
of
legislative
enactment
of
the
people.
so
that
again,
i
would
submit
that
article
xxxiv
should
be
deemed
to
be
constitutional
and
that
the
decision
of
lower
court
be
overturned.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
mr.
cox’s
argument
here
has
revealed
a
number
of
things.
i
believe
really
what
he’s
saying
is
that
california
would
have
to
submit
everything
to
a
prior
automatic
referendum
for
them
to
be
able
to
employ
a
prior
automatic
referendum
anywhere.
and
i
don’t
believe
that
there
are
any
cases
that
he
can
cite
to
indicate
that
that's
the
rule
at
the
present
time.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
i
don’t
think
that
was
a
rule
in
hunter
mr.
justice
white.
hunter
was
dealing
with
the
situation
where
there
was
no
referendum
--
pardon
me,
where
there
was
a
referendum
right
and
there
was
another
referendum
right
built
on
top
of
it
and
the
only
possible
reason
for
that
is
the
court
indicated
was
to
discriminate.
there,
you
have
racial
classification
also
the
court
so
states
--
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
that’s
correct.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
that’s
right.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
that’s
right.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
i
would
disagree
to
this
(voice
overlaps)
--
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
no,
it
is
not
true.
there
are
other
areas
in
california
where
prior
automatic
referendum
(voice
overlaps)
--
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
yes,
for
state
local
bodies,
yes.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
i
that’s
you're
very
well
raising
the
specter
which
the
court
then
may
be
faced
with
if
you
decide
here
that
xxxiv
is
unconstitutional,
i
think
you're
going
to
have
rush
of
cases
attempting
to
lay
out
the
general
principle
that
the
state
has
to
act
totally
across
the
board
in
any
area
which
it
wishes
throughout.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
in
any
event,
it
seems
to
that
what
really
is
involved
here
is
the
voting
rights
of
the
majority.
does
the
majority
of
a
state
have
the
right
in
a
purely
internal
matter
to
make
a
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
they
want
to
have
something
to
which
the
people
don’t
have
a
constitutional
or
fundamental
right?
as
far
as
i
know,
no
case
so
far
has
decided
that
low-rent
housing
is
a
constitutional
or
fundamental
right
in
which
the
state
cannot
intrude
in
any
way.
mr.
cox
cites
the
shapiro
case.
now,
the
shapiro
case
is
not
relevant
at
all
it
seems
to
me.
the
shapiro
case
involved
the
fundamental
right
or
at
least
that's
what
mr.
justice
harlan
thought
the
court
was
doing.
in
fact,
as
i
recall
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
that
case
he
indicated
that
what
the
court
there
had
done
was
to
label
the
area
a
fundamental
right
and
then
apply
a
different
equal
protection
test
on
it
and
mr.
stewart
in
a
concurring
opinion
indicated
that
that
was
not
what
the
court
had
done.
they
did
not
label
this
area
of
fundamental
right.
what
in
fact
they
had
done
was
to
say
or
treat
an
area
a
personal
right
that
could
not
be
abridged
in
any
way
--
the
right
to
travel
which
was
has
been
established
the
long
line
of
cases
going
back
well
before
1900.
it
also
calls
into
play
their
--
the
interstate
commerce
clause
and
the
right
of
a
state
to
abridge
that
in
any
way.
so,
i
don’t
think
that
case
is
relevant
at
all
and
i
really
think
we
have
to
get
back
to
this
proposition.
does
the
state
have
the
right
to
deal
with
the
poor
one
step
at
a
time?
or
does
it
have
to
deal
with
then
poor
totally
across
the
board
in
every
area?
what
california
has
done
here
is
attempt
to
deal
with
an
--
one
area
relating
to
the
poor.
it
treated
it
on
a
piecemeal
basis.
it
attempted
to
act
within
the
context
of
that
one
area.
now,
so
far
as
i
know
the
case
on
equal
protection
are
uniformed
in
stating
that
there's
no
requirement
that
everything
be
treated
exactly
the
same
as
long
as
everything
within
the
class
is
treated
the
same.
now
here,
you
have
the
class
treated
exactly
the
same,
the
record
is
unequivocal,
there's
a
stipulation
in
the
appendix,
which
the
court
can
read
that
there
are
no
other
publicly-owned
low-cost
housing
projects
in
california
except
the
type
that
appears
within
the
confines
of
article
xxxiv.
so
that
what
we’re
dealing
with
is
a
self-contain
classification
rationally
founded
because
of
the
gap
in
the
constitutional
provisions
relating
to
referendum
or
referenda
in
california.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
question.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
yes,
i
do.
(voice
overlap)
but
i
will
have
very,
very
much
difficulty
in
understanding
what
is
the
other
class
and
that
perhaps
mr.
lasky
will
go
into
that
a
bit
but
if
we’re
indicating
that
the
other
class
is
all
projects
that
are
federally
funded.
a
whole
range
of
different
types
of
federally
funded
projects
some
of
which
there
is
the
right
of
referendum
in
fact,
with
almost
without
exception
there
is
one
type
or
another
involving
all
different
types
of
money,
involving
all
different
types
of
projects.
then
it
seems
to
me
that
what
the
court
would
be
doing
by
striking
down
xxxiv
would
be
intruding
its
own
judgment
as
far
as
reasonable
minds
could
disagree
as
to
whether
or
not
this
type
of
projects
are
different
as
to
whether
or
not
the
rational
difference
is
between
them.
if
the
court
says,
no,
we
as
a
nine
wise
men
here
set
and
we’re
saying
that
as
a
matter
of
law
that
they’re
all
the
same
and
they
have
to
be
treated
the
same.
then,
i
believe
that's
what
the
thrust
of
the
opinion
would
be.
thank
you.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
we
did
have
--
i'm
not
quite
certain
about
that
justice
harlan
to
be
honest
with
you.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
well,
the
federal
fair
housing
act
itself
indicates
that
local
options
requires
options
and
until
the
local
party
--
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
certainly
not
and
that's
why
the
supremacy
clause
of
course
is
not
relevant
here
at
all.
in
fact,
at
one
time
the
federal
statutes
indicated
that
the
people
with
mentioned
referendum
specifically,
now
that
is
no
longer
in
the
law,
but
certainly
there
is
in
the
local
option
--
the
federal
scheme
itself
indicates
that
a
local
option
is
not
only
important
here
but
significant
requirement.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
yes,
we
have
counties
and
we
have
cities
and
districts
and
so
forth.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
not
that
i
know
of
--
not
that
i
know
of,
mr.
justice
harlan.
in
fact,
the
--
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
no,
it’s
not.
the
state
local
body
whoever
is
developing
the
project
make
such
judgment
and
that
can
vary
from
place
to
place
and
that's
one
other
point
if
i
could
just
mention
this
mr.
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
alright.
one
of
the
problems
in
this
case
which
i
haven’t
alluded
to
before
that
this
matter
came
up
on
summary
judgment.
there
was
no
trial
here,
there
was
no
evidence
introduced.
there
are
some
affidavits
in
the
record,
which
are
found
in
the
appendix.
but
the
difficulty
with
the
whole
thing
is
that
the
appellants
in
this
case
did
not
have
a
sufficient
amount
of
time
to
really
adequately
represent
their
client.
the
matter
was
filed.
there
had
been
particularly
a
great
deal
of
work
done
on
the
pleadings,
the
research
and
so
forth.
so
that
this
matter
was
filed
in
san
jose
all
fully
or
fully
developed
and
fully
handled
so
that
i
would
submit
that
there
are
number
of
questions
here.
as
far
as
the
court
knows
now,
there's
no
racial
discrimination
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
there
is
certainly
no
racially
motivated
--
well,
i'll
put
it
in
other
way,
there's
nothing
to
indicate
in
fact
mr.
cox
admitted
that
there's
nothing
to
indicate
that
xxxiv
is
racially
motivated.
so
certainly,
you
can
distinguish
the
reitman
case
and
hunter
on
that
ground
and
that's
a
very
significant
ground
i
think.
secondly,
there's
no
--
nothing
here
to
indicate
that
this
xxxiv
has
been
unconstitutionally
applied
or
unfairly
applied.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
record
indicates
just
the
opposite.
the
majority
of
the
voting
matters
which
have
been
presented
to
people
in
low-rent
housing
have
been
approved
and
as
i
pointed
out
to
court
yesterday
between
1968
and
1970
the
number
of
approvals
has
significantly
increased.
just
because
the
people
might
possibly
in
one
area
or
another
decide
to
turn
down
low-rent
housing
and
that
might
or
might
possibly
affect
racial
minorities.
there's
no
reason
for
this
court
to
strike
down
a
constitutional
provision
of
state.
thank
you.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
comes
to
the
court
on
appeal
from
a
three-judge
court
sitting
in
california
united
states
district
court,
northern
district
of
california.
the
matter
comes
up
from
a
summary
judgment.
the
summary
was
in
two
parts.
the
first
part
was
a
declaratory
judgment
ruling
at
article
xxxiv
of
the
state
of
california
constitution
was
violative
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
equal
protection
clause.
the
second
part
was
a
declaratory
judgment
--
pardon
me,
in
permanent
injunction
against
the
defendants
in
the
case
of
availing
themselves
or
relying
on
the
provisions
article
xxxiv
as
a
reason
for
not
proceeding
with
the
acquisition
construction
or
development
of
low
rent
housing.
the
supreme
court
has
jurisdiction
of
this
case
under
28
u.s.c.
1253
in
appeal
from
a
permanent
injunction
by
a
three-judge
court
against
the
enforcement
of
or
obedience
to
the
provisions
of
a
state
constitution
of
provision.
the
cases
before
the
court
are
really
two.
the
first
is
james
versus
valtierra
and
the
second
is
haze
versus
the
housing
authority.
in
the
first
case,
the
plaintiffs
valtierre
and
other
similarly
situated
on
behalf
of
the
class,
people
who
were
eligible
for
a
low
rent
housing
brought
an
action
against
the
members
of
the
city
council
of
the
city
san
jose
to
have
the
article
xxxiv
rule
to
be
unconstitutional.
in
haze
versus
housing
authority
and
also
in
that
action
that
joined
as
defendants
where
the
members
of
the
housing
authority
of
the
city
of
san
jose.
in
haze
versus
the
housing
authority
plaintiffs,
plaintiff
gutsy
haze
(ph)
and
other
similarly
situated
brought
the
same
type
of
action
against
the
housing
authority
of
san
mateo
county.
in
the
james
case,
an
answer
was
filed,
in
the
haze
case
an
answer
was
not
filed.
the
actions
were
consolidated
for
purposes
of
argument
and
the
decision
obtains
as
to
both
cases.
the
provisions
of
article
xxxiv
which
are
at
issue
before
the
court
basically
provide
that
no
state
public
body
shall
acquire,
construct
or
develop
low
rent
housing
unless
the
majority
of
the
people,
the
electors
qualify
to
vote
in
the
locality
in
which
the
low
rent
housing
is
to
be
constructed
by
majority
vote
in
favor
of
such
low
rent
housing.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
yes.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
the
purpose
of
article
xxxiv
justice
blackmun
was
to
fill
a
gap
in
the
referendum
procedure
in
california.
under
article
4
of
the
state
of
california
constitution,
only
legislative
actions
were
referendable.
an
opinion
of
the
state
supreme
court,
housing
authority
versus
the
superior
court
of
humble
county
in
1950
ruled
that
actions
of
a
housing
authority
operating
under
the
low
rent
housing
procedure
were
administrative
rather
than
legislative
in
character
and
therefore
could
not
be
reached
by
a
referendum.
shortly
thereafter
in
1950,
proposition
10
was
placed
before
the
voters
of
the
state
of
california.
that
proposition
is
and
was
adopted
as
article
xxxiv
so
that
in
response
to
your
question,
the
immediate
purpose
of
article
xxxiv
was
to
protect
the
people,
to
give
the
people
the
right
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
wanted
to
extend
low
rent
housing
to
the
people
in
their
particular
area.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
mr.
justice
white
it
depends
on
what
referendum
procedure
you
were
talking
about.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
yes,
under
that
type
--
since
that
was
the
original
type
of
referendum
that
the
people
thought
they
had
in
that
area.
it
was
to
fill
that
gap.
however
i
might
point
out
--
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
well,
it’s
a
prior
automatic
referendum
that’s
what
the
--
you’re
referring
too.
as
distinguished
--
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
no,
no,
basically
most
legislative
acts
are
subject
to
referendum
by
petition.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
a
subsequent
--
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
no
it
does
not.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
that’s
correct.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
i
wouldn’t
think
so,
there
wouldn’t
have
been
any
reason
for
--
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
of
course
i
can’t
really
answer
that
question
because
i
had
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
drafting
the
article.
i
can
only
surmise
that
the
people
thought
that
this
was
a
legitimate
approach
to
protect
their
rights
in
a
referendum
area
and
i
was
attempting
to
point
out.
there
are
other
types
of
referenda
in
california
which
are
prior
automatic
referenda.
there
are
some,
the
initiative
measure,
there
are
certain
type
of
annexation
and
consolidation
procedures.
the
city
charter
of
san
jose
with
which
i’m
quite
acquainted
has
a
provision
for
a
prior
automatic
referendum
of
the
area
of
sailing
parks.
and
there
are
other
types
of
prior
automatic
referenda,
but
i
don’t
feel
that
merely
because
we
have
a
prior
automatic
referenda
that
that
of
itself
lends
any
odious
color
to
the
procedure.
the
people
as
long
as
they’re
dealing
in
an
area
where
they
have
the
right
to
reserve
something,
as
long
they
treat
the
area
that
they
reserve
uniformly
and
without
treating
any
other
similar
area
in
a
different
manner.
i
feel
there’s
no
unconstitutional
treatment.
the
classification
here
in
article
xxxiv
is
precisely
limited
to
one
small
area,
low
rent
housing.
it
deals
with
that
area
because
i
point
it
out
before
that
was
the
area
that
the
supreme
court
of
california
ruled
was
not
referendable.
so
that
it
certainly
made
sense
for
the
people
to
strike
out
and
to
pick
out
that
precise
area
as
the
subject
of
their
referenda
procedure.
the
proposition
10
itself
when
it
was
passed,
the
arguments
pro
and
con
are
absolutely
neutral.
they’re
all
directed
to
the
right
of
the
people
to
reserve
their
voice
in
area
where
they
have
a
concern.
there’s
no
illusion
to
race,
there’s
no
illusion
to
a
property
per
se.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
no,
mr.
justice
harlan
it
has
not.
it’s
our
contention
that
the
article
is
--
as
i
pointed
out
before,
fills
the
gap
that
it’s
not
an
unconstitutional
classification.
it’s
not
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
its
not
unconstitutional
as
applied,
it’s
not
a
classification
based
on
race
nor
color,
and
it
does
not
violate
the
supremacy
clause.
in
the
first
place,
the
article
merely
deals
with
low
rent
housing
and
nothing
else.
it
treats
everyone
in
the
area
of
low
rent
housing
the
same.
and
as
such,
it
meets
the
tests
that
have
been
uniformly
laid
down
with
reference
to
the
test
that
the
court
applies
in
determining
whether
or
not
state
legislative
action
is
violative
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
the
case
of
the
hunter
versus
erickson
was
cited
as
a
precedent
in
the
lower
court.
and
i
submit
that
hunter
versus
erickson
on
its
facts
is
not
this
case
at
all.
in
hunter
versus
erickson,
we
were
dealing
with
the
situation
where
the
people
of
akron
had
a
referendum
procedure
with
right
across
the
board.
they
also
had
a
fear
housing
ordinance
which
had
a
procedure
set
up.
people
had
been
hired,
categories
had
been
established
and
it
was
actually
under
operation.
the
enactment
of
the
referendum
procedure
in
the
hunter
case
in
effect,
resented
or
repealed
the
existing
low
rent
housing
ordinance,
fair
housing
ordinance
and
built
a
prior
referendum
procedure
on
top
of
a
regular
referendum
procedure.
so
that
in
hunter,
it
could
not
have
been
argued
that
there
was
--
that
there
was
no
referenda
procedure
available
and
that
therefore
a
new
referendum
procedure
was
necessary.
secondly,
the
court
in
hunter
specifically
mentions
the
background
of
the
referenda
procedure.
the
fact
that
it
repealed
an
existing
fair
housing
ordinance,
the
fact
it
was
racially
motivated.
in
fact
in
the
opinion,
there
are
references
that
is
inexplicitly
racial
classification.
in
fact
mr.
justice
harlan
and
stewart
as
i
recall
in
their
concurring
opinion
indicated
that
the
provision
has
the
clear
purpose
of
making
it
more
difficult
for
racial
and
racial
minorities,
religious
and
racial
minorities
to
achieve
legislation
that
is
in
their
interest.
so,
i
submit
that
the
case
before
you
now
is
not
the
hunter
case
and
the
hunter
case
should
be
distinguished.
and
to
apply
the
hunter
case
here
seems
to
me
to
be
placing
the
court
as
a
super
legislative
body,
second
guessing
the
people
in
dealing
in
legislative
areas,
social
concern
areas
that
the
court
in
the
dandridge
versus
williams
said
was
their
right.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
reitman
and
mulkey
was
a
case
again
where
the
state
supreme
court
of
california
had
indicated
that
we
had
racial
discrimination
here
on
a
statewide
basis.
the
state
had
entered
the
field.
it
had
not
only
courage
but
actually
almost
put
forth
a
racial
discrimination.
the
supreme
court
as
i
recall
in
the
mulkey
case
took
the
finding
of
the
california
supreme
court
and
made
it
its
own
and
went
on
from
there.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
it’s
certainly
possible.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
it’s
never
been
before
the
california
supreme
court.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
it’s
never
been
in
any
california
court,
that’s
true.
the
--
as
i
indicated
before,
it’s
not
discriminatory
on
its
face.
there
is
no
racial
classification
in
the
constitutional
provision.
race
is
not
even
mentioned.
the
appellees
here
indicate
well,
we
know
as
matter
of
fact
that
most
of
the
poor
people
are
black
or
spanish
speaking
etcetera.
i
submit
that
this
may
or
may
not
be
true.
however,
this
does
not
per
se
make
a
statute
or
a
constitutional
provision
which
affects
a
minority.
it
doesn’t
make
it
into
a
racial
classification.
as
matter
of
fact,
i’m
sure
that
we’ll
find
that
as
far
as
numbers
go,
there
are
more
poor
whites
than
poor
blacks.
but
that
really
is
not
relevant,
i
don’t
feel
the
issues
here.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
reitman
versus
--
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
reitman
versus
mulkey
is
quite
distinguishable
in
this
regard
and
very
like
hunter.
reitman
versus
mulkey
again
repealed
a
fair
housing
procedure,
a
non
discriminatory
procedure
which
had
been
setup
in
the
state
of
california.
the
court
goes
into
the
background
and
the
purpose
and
certainly
the
court
was
very,
very
interested
in
that
just
as
it
was
in
the
hunter
case.
there’s
nothing
of
this
sort
in
the
case
before
court
now.
there’s
nothing
in
the
arguments
pro
and
con
as
i
said
before
if
it’s
right
into
the
context
of
the
necessity
of
a
referendum
procedure.
the
only
conceivable
argument
it
seems
to
me
that
can
be
race
against
the
constitutional
(inaudible)
of
34,
is
a
fact
that
it’s
a
prior
automatic
referendum
as
distinguished
from
a
subsequent
petition
referendum.
and
i
submit
that
that
is
not
crucial
because
they’re
both
referendum
procedures.
this
is
an
area
where
the
state
has
a
legitimate
concern
and
the
court
should
not
intrude
its
own
judgment
in
place
of
the
legitimate
concerns
of
a
state
people.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
the
state
interests
here
are
both
physical
and
the
fact
low
rent
housing
per
se
maybe
that.
the
physical
considerations
flow
from
the
fact
that
under
the
low
cost
housing
procedure,
the
local
public
body
takes
the
property
which
is
the
low
rent
housing
project
of
the
tax
rules
in
return
for
10%
of
the
rents.
now
that
means
that
also
the
people
are
required
to
provide
certain
municipal
or
county
or
what
have
you
--
what
ever
level
of
government
that
we’re
dealing
with
services
for
the
project,
including
possibly
schools,
parks,
and
the
improvements
of
that
nature
which
they
wouldn’t
normally
have
to
provide
if
the
low
rent
housing
project
did
not
go
in
a
particular
area.
the
other
consideration
is
the
fact
that
low
rent
housing
is
not
a
blessing
right
across
the
board.
the
experts
in
low
rent
housing
disagree
among
themselves
as
to
whether
not
as
good
or
bad.
they’re
all
kinds’
arguments
about
how
large
the
housing
should
be,
when
it
should
be
acquired
constructed
and
developed.
when
it
should
be
and
questions
of
that
nature.
in
fact,
there
has
been
some
history
here.
i
point
out
the
housing
project
in
saint
louis
which
was
an
absolute
fiasco.
in
the
past,
most
of
these
housing
projects
have
been
mandate
nature.
they
have
let
actually
to
internal
segregation.
they
let
to
isolation,
get
a
isolation
and
some
of
them
have
as
i
say
fallen
flat
on
their
face.
as
i
recall
in
saint
louis,
over
50%
of
that
project
is
now
vacant.
realizing
that
the
people
are
only
getting
back
10%
of
the
rents
in
return
for
taking
property
which
might
be
extremely
valuable
in
terms
of
tax
return
off
the
rules.
if
a
projects
fails,
the
people
certainly
should
have
the
right
to
consider
that
aspect
before
they
want
a
low
cost
housing
project
to
go
in
anywhere.
because
10%
of
a
project,
100%
filled
full,
is
certainly
not
the
same
as
10%
of
the
rents
of
the
project
only
40%
or
50%
full.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
there
have
been
a
--
i
don’t
have
the
exact
number
justice
harlan
but
i
will
point
this
out.
that
brings
up
a
very
interesting
area
up
for
discussion.
actually,
34
has
not
been
discriminatory
as
applied.
as
a
matter
of
fact
most
of
the
elections
have
been
voted
in
favor
of
the
low
rent
housing.
the
reason
that
it’s
even
close
in
terms
of
units
is
because
in
los
angeles
as
i
recall
in
1952,
a
10,000
unit
low
cost
housing
project
was
turned
down.
but
as
i
understand
it,
that
was
never
resubmitted
to
the
people.
there’s
nothing
in
34
that
prohibits
low
cost
housing
from
going
in.
it
merely
requires
a
vote.
and
i
submit
that
it’s
any
different
from
any
type
of
vote,
school
bond
or
what
have
you.
if
that
is
turned
down,
the
people
still
have
the
right
to
come
back.
the
city
council
can
again
put
up
before
the
people
and
perhaps
that’s
a
blessing.
if
there’s
something
wrong
with
the
project
that
gives
everybody
an
opportunity
to
come
back
and
think
about
it.
it
may
have
been
poorly
planned,
the
education
of
the
electorate
may
not
have
been
proper.
that
people
just
--
that
the
proponents
may
not
have
done
their
homework.
and
i
submit
that
it’s
quite
interesting
that
as
i
recall
between
1968
and
1970,
the
percentage
of
referenda
that
had
been
approved
are
actually
going
up
not
down
so
that
we
are
not
dealing
in
an
area
where
discrimination
is
running
rampant.
i
also
want
to
touch
upon
points
that
were
brought
up
in
the
appellees
brief,
they
attempt
to
bring
in
this
whole
classification
into
invidious
classification,
suspect
classification,
classifications
that
are
traditionally
disfavored.
and
i
submit
that
this
is
not
the
kind
of
a
classification
which
fits
any
of
those
tests.
most
of
the
cases
were
the
--
the
harper
case
for
example,
which
mentioned
that
wealth
and
race
were
suspect
classifications.
the
question
of
wealth
really
was
not
relevant
to
that
case
at
all.
the
only
reason
it
was
important
was
because
people
who
were
poor
were
being
deprived
of
the
right
to
vote.
and
the
right
to
vote
is
a
fundamentally
constitutionally
guaranteed
right.
and
unless
the
court
here
is
willing
to
extend
its
tests
of
fundamentally
guaranteed
rights
to
low
rent
housing,
i
think
it
would
be
extremely
dangerous
to
uphold
the
district
court
in
this
area.
neither
is
this
case,
a
criminal
case
where
someone
is
asking
for
the
right
of
a
transcript
on
appeal
or
anything
like
that.
i
submit
that
this
article
xxxiv
is
neutral
in
purpose,
completely
undiscriminatory
in
its
face
and
as
applied.
and
i
submit
that
again
that
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
the
court
launches
out
in
this
area
and
strikes
down
34,
it
would
seem
rather
difficult
to
determine
where
the
line
will
be
drawn.
if
a
provisional
constitutional
provision
like
this
can
be
stricken
down
by
this
court,
there’s
no
end
to
the
intrusion
of
the
judiciary
into
the
legitimate
concerns
of
legislative
enactment
of
the
people.
so
that
again,
i
would
submit
that
article
xxxiv
should
be
deemed
to
be
constitutional
and
that
the
decision
of
lower
court
be
overturned.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
mr.
cox’s
argument
here
has
revealed
a
number
of
things.
i
believe
really
what
he’s
saying
is
that
california
would
have
to
submit
everything
to
a
prior
automatic
referendum
for
them
to
be
able
to
employ
a
prior
automatic
referendum
anywhere.
and
i
don’t
believe
that
there
are
any
cases
that
he
can
cite
to
indicate
that
that's
the
rule
at
the
present
time.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
i
don’t
think
that
was
a
rule
in
hunter
mr.
justice
white.
hunter
was
dealing
with
the
situation
where
there
was
no
referendum
--
pardon
me,
where
there
was
a
referendum
right
and
there
was
another
referendum
right
built
on
top
of
it
and
the
only
possible
reason
for
that
is
the
court
indicated
was
to
discriminate.
there,
you
have
racial
classification
also
the
court
so
states
--
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
that’s
correct.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
that’s
right.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
that’s
right.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
i
would
disagree
to
this
(voice
overlaps)
--
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
no,
it
is
not
true.
there
are
other
areas
in
california
where
prior
automatic
referendum
(voice
overlaps)
--
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
yes,
for
state
local
bodies,
yes.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
i
that’s
you're
very
well
raising
the
specter
which
the
court
then
may
be
faced
with
if
you
decide
here
that
xxxiv
is
unconstitutional,
i
think
you're
going
to
have
rush
of
cases
attempting
to
lay
out
the
general
principle
that
the
state
has
to
act
totally
across
the
board
in
any
area
which
it
wishes
throughout.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
in
any
event,
it
seems
to
that
what
really
is
involved
here
is
the
voting
rights
of
the
majority.
does
the
majority
of
a
state
have
the
right
in
a
purely
internal
matter
to
make
a
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
they
want
to
have
something
to
which
the
people
don’t
have
a
constitutional
or
fundamental
right?
as
far
as
i
know,
no
case
so
far
has
decided
that
low-rent
housing
is
a
constitutional
or
fundamental
right
in
which
the
state
cannot
intrude
in
any
way.
mr.
cox
cites
the
shapiro
case.
now,
the
shapiro
case
is
not
relevant
at
all
it
seems
to
me.
the
shapiro
case
involved
the
fundamental
right
or
at
least
that's
what
mr.
justice
harlan
thought
the
court
was
doing.
in
fact,
as
i
recall
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
that
case
he
indicated
that
what
the
court
there
had
done
was
to
label
the
area
a
fundamental
right
and
then
apply
a
different
equal
protection
test
on
it
and
mr.
stewart
in
a
concurring
opinion
indicated
that
that
was
not
what
the
court
had
done.
they
did
not
label
this
area
of
fundamental
right.
what
in
fact
they
had
done
was
to
say
or
treat
an
area
a
personal
right
that
could
not
be
abridged
in
any
way
--
the
right
to
travel
which
was
has
been
established
the
long
line
of
cases
going
back
well
before
1900.
it
also
calls
into
play
their
--
the
interstate
commerce
clause
and
the
right
of
a
state
to
abridge
that
in
any
way.
so,
i
don’t
think
that
case
is
relevant
at
all
and
i
really
think
we
have
to
get
back
to
this
proposition.
does
the
state
have
the
right
to
deal
with
the
poor
one
step
at
a
time?
or
does
it
have
to
deal
with
then
poor
totally
across
the
board
in
every
area?
what
california
has
done
here
is
attempt
to
deal
with
an
--
one
area
relating
to
the
poor.
it
treated
it
on
a
piecemeal
basis.
it
attempted
to
act
within
the
context
of
that
one
area.
now,
so
far
as
i
know
the
case
on
equal
protection
are
uniformed
in
stating
that
there's
no
requirement
that
everything
be
treated
exactly
the
same
as
long
as
everything
within
the
class
is
treated
the
same.
now
here,
you
have
the
class
treated
exactly
the
same,
the
record
is
unequivocal,
there's
a
stipulation
in
the
appendix,
which
the
court
can
read
that
there
are
no
other
publicly-owned
low-cost
housing
projects
in
california
except
the
type
that
appears
within
the
confines
of
article
xxxiv.
so
that
what
we’re
dealing
with
is
a
self-contain
classification
rationally
founded
because
of
the
gap
in
the
constitutional
provisions
relating
to
referendum
or
referenda
in
california.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
question.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
yes,
i
do.
(voice
overlap)
but
i
will
have
very,
very
much
difficulty
in
understanding
what
is
the
other
class
and
that
perhaps
mr.
lasky
will
go
into
that
a
bit
but
if
we’re
indicating
that
the
other
class
is
all
projects
that
are
federally
funded.
a
whole
range
of
different
types
of
federally
funded
projects
some
of
which
there
is
the
right
of
referendum
in
fact,
with
almost
without
exception
there
is
one
type
or
another
involving
all
different
types
of
money,
involving
all
different
types
of
projects.
then
it
seems
to
me
that
what
the
court
would
be
doing
by
striking
down
xxxiv
would
be
intruding
its
own
judgment
as
far
as
reasonable
minds
could
disagree
as
to
whether
or
not
this
type
of
projects
are
different
as
to
whether
or
not
the
rational
difference
is
between
them.
if
the
court
says,
no,
we
as
a
nine
wise
men
here
set
and
we’re
saying
that
as
a
matter
of
law
that
they’re
all
the
same
and
they
have
to
be
treated
the
same.
then,
i
believe
that's
what
the
thrust
of
the
opinion
would
be.
thank
you.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
we
did
have
--
i'm
not
quite
certain
about
that
justice
harlan
to
be
honest
with
you.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
well,
the
federal
fair
housing
act
itself
indicates
that
local
options
requires
options
and
until
the
local
party
--
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
certainly
not
and
that's
why
the
supremacy
clause
of
course
is
not
relevant
here
at
all.
in
fact,
at
one
time
the
federal
statutes
indicated
that
the
people
with
mentioned
referendum
specifically,
now
that
is
no
longer
in
the
law,
but
certainly
there
is
in
the
local
option
--
the
federal
scheme
itself
indicates
that
a
local
option
is
not
only
important
here
but
significant
requirement.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
yes,
we
have
counties
and
we
have
cities
and
districts
and
so
forth.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
not
that
i
know
of
--
not
that
i
know
of,
mr.
justice
harlan.
in
fact,
the
--
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
no,
it’s
not.
the
state
local
body
whoever
is
developing
the
project
make
such
judgment
and
that
can
vary
from
place
to
place
and
that's
one
other
point
if
i
could
just
mention
this
mr.
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
donald
c.
atkinson
alright.
one
of
the
problems
in
this
case
which
i
haven’t
alluded
to
before
that
this
matter
came
up
on
summary
judgment.
there
was
no
trial
here,
there
was
no
evidence
introduced.
there
are
some
affidavits
in
the
record,
which
are
found
in
the
appendix.
but
the
difficulty
with
the
whole
thing
is
that
the
appellants
in
this
case
did
not
have
a
sufficient
amount
of
time
to
really
adequately
represent
their
client.
the
matter
was
filed.
there
had
been
particularly
a
great
deal
of
work
done
on
the
pleadings,
the
research
and
so
forth.
so
that
this
matter
was
filed
in
san
jose
all
fully
or
fully
developed
and
fully
handled
so
that
i
would
submit
that
there
are
number
of
questions
here.
as
far
as
the
court
knows
now,
there's
no
racial
discrimination
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
there
is
certainly
no
racially
motivated
--
well,
i'll
put
it
in
other
way,
there's
nothing
to
indicate
in
fact
mr.
cox
admitted
that
there's
nothing
to
indicate
that
xxxiv
is
racially
motivated.
so
certainly,
you
can
distinguish
the
reitman
case
and
hunter
on
that
ground
and
that's
a
very
significant
ground
i
think.
secondly,
there's
no
--
nothing
here
to
indicate
that
this
xxxiv
has
been
unconstitutionally
applied
or
unfairly
applied.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
record
indicates
just
the
opposite.
the
majority
of
the
voting
matters
which
have
been
presented
to
people
in
low-rent
housing
have
been
approved
and
as
i
pointed
out
to
court
yesterday
between
1968
and
1970
the
number
of
approvals
has
significantly
increased.
just
because
the
people
might
possibly
in
one
area
or
another
decide
to
turn
down
low-rent
housing
and
that
might
or
might
possibly
affect
racial
minorities.
there's
no
reason
for
this
court
to
strike
down
a
constitutional
provision
of
state.
thank
you.
