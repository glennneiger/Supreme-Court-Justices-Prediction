justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
isn’t
article
xxxiv
is
somewhat
different
from
the
normal
referendum
provisions?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
you
said
it
was
filled
a
gap
in
the
referendum
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
it
did
something
more
than
that,
isn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
every
legislative
action
in
california
is
not
subject
to
referendum
i
wouldn’t
say
it
isn’t?
i
mean
automatic
referendum.
[voice
overlap]
ask
for
the
legislature
that
a
counsel
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
one
doesn’t
work
that
way,
isn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
automatic?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
with
--
if
the
general
referendum
provision
had
been
applicable,
i
don’t
suppose
34
would
have
been
passed,
is
that
your
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
be
the
purpose
of
making
it
automatic
instead
of
a
subject
to
petition?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
cox,
i
take
it
that
hunter
and
your
argument
depends
on
their
being
--
or
depends
upon
there
being
a
constitutional
difference
between
subjecting
all
legislation
to
a
referendum
by
petition
and
singling
out
some
particular
subject
matter
for
an
automatic
referendum.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
take
it
to
few
and
your
town
meeting
where
you
lived
suddenly
decided
that
public
housing
matters
that
would
have
to
be
passed
of
two-town
meetings
instead
of
one
you
would
have
in
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
about
hunter?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
discrimination
amounted
to
the
discrimination
amounted
to
subjecting
one
type
of
subject
matter
to
an
automatic
referendum,
whereas
the
general
referendum
law
required
the
petition.
now,
here
in
california
you
have
a
general
referendum
law
by
petition?
justice
byron
r.
white
except
that
this
administrative
action
that
was
held
was
not
subject
to
that,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
california
in
filling
the
void
said,
“well,
we
won't
subject
this
administrative
action
to
referendum
by
petition.”
justice
byron
r.
white
like
all
other
subject
matters
are
subject
to
but
we
will
subject
it
to
an
automatic
referendum,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn’t
that
true?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
they
are
true,
but
your
general
referendum
law
is
a
petition
referendum?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
and
here
you
subjected
the
administrative
action
to
an
automatic
referendum,
that’s
so
far
i'm
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
may
be
some
other
automatic
referendum
areas
but
and
they
might
be
a
suspect
as
this
one
for
all
i
know
(voice
overlap)
but
we’re
talking
about
this
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we
already
have
one.
so,
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don’t
get
the
fourteenth
amendment
reaches
overbreadth
or
i
mean
underbreadth?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
mean
don’t
you
think
the
fourteenth
amendment
requires
the
comparison
of
treatment
not
only
within
the
class
but
between
classes?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
lasky,
i
take
it
part
of
your
argument
that
is
that
the
subject
matter
of
this
automatic
referendum
indicates
that
this
scheme
is
not
a
discrimination
against
the
poor
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
any
more
than
for
example
the
automatic
referendum
on
municipal
bonds.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
lasky,
let's
assume
that
california
had
no
referendum
law
whatsoever
except
an
automatic
referendum
with
respect
to
public
housing
projects.
now,
based
on
your
argument,
i
would
take
you
would
say
the
state
was
perfectly
entitled
to
do
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
say
there
certainly
they
were
treating
certain
subject
matters
different?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
know
any
state
that
doesn’t
treat
subject
matters
different?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know
any
state
of
the
union
that
doesn’t
create
some
matters
differently?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
say
if
the
california
had
no
referenda
at
all
and
suddenly
it
required
that
anti-racial
discrimination
measures
be
subjected
to
a
referendum
and
no
other
subject
matters
are
required
to
do
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
law
said
instead
of
saying
racial
or
anything
that
has
to
do
with
welfare
or
poor
relief
must
have
automatic
referendum?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
it
weren’t
then
you're
in
trouble
here
a
little
bit,
aren’t
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
it
weren’t
constitutional?
you’re
in
some
trouble
here,
aren’t
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
what
is
the
--
what
does
the
low-rent
housing
project
cost
to
state
of
california
as
a
state
out
of
its
tax
funds?
justice
byron
r.
white
these
projects
are
done
locally
not
by
the
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
well
i'm
including
all
the
state
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
no
additional
--
there’s
no
appropriation
of
tax
monies
except
for
what
--
for
services?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
lasky,
do
you
have
any
comment
about
reitman
against
mulkey?
do
you
think
that
has
any
implications
to
the
dispositions
of
this
lawsuit?
justice
byron
r.
white
may
i
ask,
mr.
cox.
do
i
correctly
understand
what
you're
attacking
is
not
that
there
is
a
referendum
but
that
california
has
said
that
the
referendum
in
this
instance
must
be
mandatory
whereas
as
to
other
subject
matter,
it
permits
a
petition,
precisely
one
(voice
overlap)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
then
if
this
particular
subject
matter
were
subject
to
a
petition
referendum
but
no
other
subject
matter
was
subject
to
any
referendum?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
since
california
does
have
the
petition
referendum
for
a
lot
of
subjects
(voice
overlap)
and
this
also
were
only
subject
to
a
petition
referendum
then
you
would
not
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
you
might
be
here
but
on
a
different
ground?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
suggesting
there
are
unresolved
issues
in
california
constitutional
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
california
decision
was
the
equal
protection
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
cox,
would
you
have
the
same
argument
if
the
california
had
simply
said
that
all
changes
in
zoning
of
laws
must
be
submitted
to
an
automatic
referendum.
that’s
the
only
category
of
law
is
submitted
to
the
automatic
referendum
and
everything
else
is
by
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
property
owner
comes
along
and
says,
this
is
a
classification
strictly
on
property
owners.
it’s
no
different
in
poor
classification
and
it’s
just
invidious
as
you
were
arguing
about
a
couple
of
years
ago
in
the
poor
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can
have
some
classification
based
on
property
owning
rather
than
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
can't
have
classification
based
on
non-property
owning?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
context
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
this
case
involved
both
with
a
law
subjecting
zoning
laws
to
the
automatic
referendum
and
the
subject
matter
that’s
here
now,
you
would
sustain
the
one
and
strike
down
the
other.
if
this
case
had
both
issues
in
it
there
were
two
--
the
provision
of
the
california
constitutional
provision
subjected
to
the
automatic
referendum
low-rent
housing
--
justice
byron

subjected
the

low-rent

all

this
