mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
appellees
briefs
we’ve
canvassed
the
number
of
grounds
which
we
believe
that
article
xxxiv
of
the
california
constitution
violates
both
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
supremacy
clause.
in
my
oral
argument,
i
intend
to
confine
myself
to
the
essence
of
our
argument
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
it
very
briefly
is
this,
it’s
that
article
xxxiv
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
because
it
builds
into
the
very
structure
of
government,
of
local
government
in
california
an
explicit
discrimination
against
the
poor.
in
the
words
of
the
statute
against
persons
of
low
income
who
are
defined,
i
should
say
of
the
constitution
article
xxxiv,
who
are
defined
as
persons
whose
income
is
insufficient
to
provide
them
with
safe,
decent
and
sanitary
housing
without
overcrowding.
the
discrimination
here
as
in
hunter
against
erickson
consists
of
putting
the
poor
the
disadvantaged
class,
putting
before
them
a
special
obstacle
which
they
must
surmount
in
order
to
secure
government
action
in
their
behalf
which
faces
no
other
group
seeking
government
action
in
its
behalf.
hunter
and
erickson
held
that
that
very
kind
of
discrimination
was
unconstitutional
where
it
ran
against
racial
minorities.
our
contention
is,
that
it
is
equally
unconstitutional
where
it
runs
explicitly
against
the
poor
and
for
the
most
part
in
practice
also
against
racial
minority.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
that
it
would
--
i’m
not
quite
sure
mr.
chief
justice
what
you
mean
by
public
housing
if
it
said
all
--
mr.
archibald
cox
if
it
said
all
subsidized
housing
by
the
federal
or
state
government.
then,
i
think
we
would
have
a
somewhat
different
case
because
here
there
clearly
is
discrimination
between
subsidized,
middle
income
and
upper
income
housing
which
is
subsidized
by
the
federal
government
and
low
rental
housing
for
the
poor.
but
i’m
not
sure
that
there
wouldn’t
still
be
an
argument
that
the
poor
who
would
be
still
the
chief
ones
in
need
of
housing
and
the
chief
beneficiaries
of
housing
where
the
victims
of
a
discrimination
taking
a
somewhat
broader
universe
and
looking
at
kinds
of
local
government
action
more
broadly
as
the
court
did,
indeed
as
all
the
justices
did
in
hunter
and
erickson.
but
for
our
purposes,
that
case
can
be
left
to
another
day.
indeed,
i
think
here
and
as
i
shall
try
to
show
a
little
farther
on,
whatever
comparison
you
take,
there
is
no
neutral
principle
that
will
explain
this
discrimination.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
you
say
zoning
--
if
there
were
--
let
me
change
your
honor’s
example
just
a
little
bit
because
it
--
when
occurred
that’s
very
likely.
and
that
is
if
the
zoning
laws
required
that
all
housing
above
certain
numbers
of
units
be
submitted
the
referendum,
then
we
would
have
a
different
question,
that
would
cover
high
rise
apartments
for
middle
income
and
well
to
do,
and
it
would
certainly
be
arguable
that
there
was
some
neutral
principles
so
i
think
that
case
is
really
very
different
from
mine.
i
planned
to
develop
the
argument
which
i
just
get
in
four
steps.
the
first
is
that
article
xxxiv
unquestionably
i
think
erects
a
special
obstacle
in
front
of
persons
of
low
income
in
seeking
to
have
their
need
for
government
action
to
fulfill
one
of
their
greatest
necessities.
having
the
government
act
to
fill
it
as
compared
with
any
other
group,
in
order
to
get
any
housing
project,
public
housing
project
under
way
in
california
quite
apart
from
article
xxxiv,
there
must
either
have
been
or
must
be
in
the
future
of
four
principle
steps.
the
first
would
be
state
legislation
empowering
the
municipalities
to
accept
the
benefits
of
the
housing
act
--
federal
housing
act
of
1937
and
constituting
local
housing
authorities,
that
step
has
been
taken.
the
next
step
is
the
passage
of
a
resolution
by
the
county
government
or
the
city
government
as
the
case
maybe,
activating
its
housing
authority
and
that
step
has
been
taken
in
both
san
mateo
county
and
in
the
city
of
san
jose,
the
two
units
involved
in
these
cases.
then
the
third
step
is
a
preliminary
application
for
funds
to
prepare
the
drawings,
get
the
estimates,
take
the
other
steps
to
get
a
housing
project
underway.
and
that
application
must
be
approved
by
the
board
of
supervisors
for
the
county
or
by
the
city
council
for
the
city
by
resolution
in
the
same
manner
as
local
government
action
is
normally
taken.
and
at
that
time
too
by
resolution,
the
local
subdivision
must
enter
into
an
agreement
of
cooperation
with
the
federal
housing
authority.
so,
you
have
municipal
action
according
to
the
normal
channels
at
that
step.
then
the
fourth
step
of
course,
would
be
approving
the
plans
for
the
project,
approving
the
bonds
and
the
various
other
mechanics
to
occurring
it
out.
and
i
would
emphasize
that
under
california
law,
at
that
step
again
the
local
legislative
body
is
required
to
approve
the
particular
project.
now
what
the
article
xxxiv
does
is
to
say
in
addition
to
those
things,
persons
of
low
income
who
are
seeking
this
kind
of
government
action
in
relief
of
their
needs
must
go
automatically
to
a
referendum
in
which
they
secure
popular
approval
of
the
project.
this
is
an
additional
step
to
what
would
be
required
for
any
other
effective
kind
of
action
by
the
local
government
with
the
exception
of
issues
of
general
revenue
bonds
which
i’ll
deal
with
a
little
later.
the
disadvantage
which
is
expressly
put
on
the
poor
by
article
xxxiv
is
exactly
the
same
i
point
out
as
the
disadvantage
under
which
the
ordinance
in
hunter
and
erickson
put
those
who
were
interested
in
fair
housing
legislation.
in
akron
as
in
san
jose
there
was
a
general
provision
for
a
referendum
on
petition
of
a
stated
number
of
citizens,
but
the
charter
amendment
in
the
akron
case
called
for
an
automatic
referendum.
and
the
court
said
there
that
the
difference
was
enough
to
constitute
a
denial
of
equal
protection.
the
differences
here
is
exactly
the
same
and
we
say
that
it
too
constitutes
a
denial
of
equal
protection.
some
argument
is
made
in
the
briefs
that
was
made
a
few
minutes
ago
by
counsel
to
the
effect
that
article
4
section
1
of
the
california
constitution
provides
for
a
referendum
and
thus
there
is
no
discrimination
in
this
case.
i
find
out
that
there
are
three
major
differences.
first,
article
4
section
1
does
not
provide
for
an
automatic
referendum,
it
provides
for
a
referendum
only
on
petition
of
a
stated
number
of
vote,
5%
or
8%
depending
on
the
area
we’re
talking
about.
second,
the
normal
referendum
in
california
comes
after
the
subdivision
or
the
legislator
has
acted.
and
the
action
is
effective
unless
beat
out
by
the
voters.
here,
the
referendum
must
be
held
before
anything
effective
can
be
done.
and
the
third,
and
very
important
point
is
that
article
xxxiv
sets
up
a
one
way
street
or
it
may
be
used
to
defeat
housing
but
it
may
never
be
used
to
obtain
housing
whereas
the
normal
initiative
in
referendum
are
linked
together
and
they
may
operate
both
ways.
and
we
submit
that
these
three
differences
make
a
clear
cut
disadvantage
of
such
a
kind
as
denies
the
equal
protection
of
the
law.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
i
would
supposed
--
we
would
have
a
very
different
case
mr.
chief
justice,
if
what
article
xxxiv
did
was
to
subject
public
housing
project
to
the
normal
initiative
and
referendum
provisions
of
the
california
constitution.
did
you
ask
how
would
i
phrase
the
referendum?
mr.
archibald
cox
to
the
voters?
mr.
archibald
cox
i
suppose,
it
would,
yes.
shall
the
local
housing
authority,
they
authorized
and
directed
to
enter
in
the
contracts
with
the
federal
government
for
such
and
such
a
number
of
units
of
housing.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
it
could
even
say
at
a
particular
place
or
particular
places
since
the
housing
is
now
in
chiefly
in
smaller
blocks
then
some
of
the
housing
projects
that
were
described
to
us.
i
would
point
out
in
addition
that
this
not
only
operates
as
a
disadvantage
against
poor
as
in
hunter
and
erickson
but
that
there
is
no
neutral
principle
which
can
be
invoked
to
justify.
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
our
argument
does
not
challenge
the
right
of
the
voters
of
california
to
reserve
housing
and
other
like
questions
for
popular
approval
provided
that
it
is
done
in
accordance
with
some
neutral
principle
and
then
one
gets
the
problem
with
defining
the
class
that
i
was
discussing
an
answer
to
the
chief
justice’s
question.
all
the
important
characteristics
and
consequences
of
publicly
owned
housing
projects
of
a
low
cost
variety
other
than
the
involvement
of
persons
of
low
income
attached
to
other
species
of
government
action.
california
does
not
treat
any
of
them
as
a
cause
for
requiring
an
automatic
referendum.
for
example,
federal
financing
isn’t
the
reason
for
an
automatic
referendum
in
any
number
of
context.
urban
renewal
projects,
highways,
airports,
hospitals,
other
things
of
that
kind,other
than
effect
upon
land
use
isn’t
otherwise
treated
as
a
need
for
a
referendum.
well,
the
zoning
laws
can
be
changed
in
ways
that
permit
shopping
centers,
industrial
plants,
high
rise
apartments
that
will
change
the
character
of
the
land
for
generations.
indeed
public
ownership
of
projects
that
will
affect
the
character
of
the
land
for
generations
is
not
generally
treated
as
a
reason
for
requiring
mandatory
popular
approval.
again
airports,
sewage
disposal
plants,
educational
buildings
and
urban
renewal
are
example.
nor
can
it
be
said
fairly
i
think,
that
the
possible
increase
demand
for
municipal
services
resulting
from
a
publicly
owned
housing
project
is
a
neutral
reason
for
requiring
a
referendum
because
there
are
plenty
of
other
changes
attendant
upon
municipal
law
which
will
create
a
need
for
additional
services
but
they
are
not
made
the
basis
for
a
mandatory
referendum,
universities,
medical
complexes,
sports
stadiums,
hospitals,
universities
and
the
like.
the
lessening
of
tax
revenues
is
suggested
by
the
appellants
as
a
neutral
principle
which
certainly
not
everything
that
takes
land
of
the
tax
rows
even
for
public
ownership
is
submitted
to
referendum
in
california.
in
california
there
are
only
two
so
far
as
i
know,
kinds
of
mandatory
referendum.
one
is
a
change
in
political
boundaries
or
the
structure
of
local
government.
well,
article
xxxiv
make
such
a
change
that
the
vote
taken
under
it
on
a
housing
isn’t
a
vote
on
a
change
in
the
political
structure
or
political
boundaries.
the
other
mandatory
referendum
is
required
in
the
case
of
the
issuance
of
bonds
which
are
--
or
bonds
of
the
state,
county,
city
or
other
subdivision
of
the
government
and
which
constitute
an
obligation
paid
out
of
general
tax
revenues.
the
california
supreme
court
pointed
out
that
there
are
two
important
differences
here
between
general
municipal
obligations
and
the
bonds
of
the
housing
authority.
one
is
that
the
housing
authorities
bonds
are
not
obligations
of
the
city,
county,
state
or
other
public
subdivision
as
required
in
the
california
constitution.
second,
they
most
clearly
are
not
obligations
that
must
be
paid
out
of
general
tax
revenues.
the
bonds
are
paid
by
the
federal
government
and
to
some
small
extent
by
any
surplus
rents
over
cost
of
maintenance
of
the
building,
but
usually
they
are
not,
so
in
fact
the
bonds
are
obligations
to
the
federal
government
and
are
paid
by
the
federal
government.
in
sum
i
think
the
indisputable
purpose
and
effect
of
article
xxxiv
is
to
erect
this
special
obstacle
in
the
path
of
the
poor
when
they
seek
government
action
that
does
not
confront
any
other
group
when
it
is
seeking
political
or
governmental
action
in
its
behalf.
our
second
main
point
which
i’ll
develop
tomorrow
is
to
emphasize
that
article
xxxiv
builds
it’s
unique
bias
against
the
poor
into
the
very
structure
of
the
political
system,
person
of
low
income,
seeking
government
assistance
are
told
in
effect,
will
you
stand
differently
before
your
government
than
anyone
else
stands
when
he
is
seeking
government
assistance.
i
emphasize
this
because
this
is
not
a
case
let’s
say
like
3953
williams
where
one
was
dealing
with
substantive
government
policies
and
where
the
court
said
there
was
greater
latitude
in
social
and
economic
matters.
here
we’re
dealing
with
the
structure
of
government
itself.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
suggested
yesterday
that
our
submission
that
article
xxxiv
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
could
conveniently
be
approached
in
four
steps.
the
first
which
i
covered
was
to
show
that
the
indisputable
purpose
and
effect
of
article
xxxiv
is
to
erect
an
obstacle
in
the
perils
of
the
poor
when
they
seek
governmental
action
to
supply
their
need
for
housing.
it
does
not
confront
any
other
group
seeking
governmental
action
to
satisfy
its
demands
on
the
political
system
and
that
the
provisions
for
the
automatic
referendum
cannot
be
explained
by
the
consistent
application
of
any
neutral
or
general
principle.
our
second
main
point
is
to
emphasize
that
article
xxxiv
builds
its
unique
bias
into
the
very
structure
of
the
political
system
into
the
very
core
of
government
itself.
i
stress
that
point
also
its
obvious
for
this
reason.
it’s
quite
clear
that
in
working
out
substantive
policies
lines
must
be
drawn
by
government
and
sometimes
those
lines
are
very
difficult
ones
as
in
dandridge
v.
williams.
it’s
also
clear
that
substantive
policies
when
developed
by
government
sometimes
operate
more
harshly
against
one
class
than
against
another.
an
example
is
the
currently
much
publicized
litigations
so
not
in
this
court
attacking
zoning
laws
on
the
ground
that
they
fenced
the
poor
out
of
communities.
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that
we’re
not
asking
the
court
to
render
a
decision
that
has
any
impact
upon
those
kinds
of
questions.
here,
the
bias
is
in
the
way
decision
are
reached
by
the
political
community
and
it
seems
to
us
that
not
only
narrows
the
issue
but
that
it
makes
the
discrimination
a
great
deal
more
wrong,
it’s
a
discrimination,
like
discrimination
in
voting
or
in
apportionment
or
even
in
the
way
one
stands
before
the
court.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don’t
think
one
can
say
that
there
is
any
proof
that
the
thinking
of
those
who
voted
to
put
this
into
the
constitution
was
that
there's
any
proof
that
it
was
racially
motivated.
we
do
know
that
in
its
operation
since
it
bears
upon
the
poor
it
bears
more
harshly
upon
minorities
than
it
does
on
any
other
group.
that’s
particularly
true
in
the
area
of
housing.
i
do
intend
to
develop
that
point
a
little
bit
before
the
two
arguments
are
over.
but
i
think
that
this
being
a
discrimination
built
into
the
political
system
that
the
case
comes
within
what
was
said
in
hunter
and
erickson.
the
state
may
no
more
disadvantage
any
particular
group
by
making
it
more
difficult
to
enact
legislation
in
its
behalf
that
it
may
dilute
any
person’s
vote
or
given
a
group
a
smaller
representation
than
others
of
comparable
size.
the
third
main
point
i
would
wish
to
emphasize
is
that
on
the
face
of
this
statute,
it
singles
out
for
separate
classification
the
poor
or
in
the
words
of
the
statute
persons
of
low
income.
and
persons
of
low
income
are
defined
as
persons
or
families
who
let
the
amount
of
income
which
is
necessary
to
enable
them
and
to
live
in
decent,
safe,
and
sanitary
dwellings
without
overcrowding.
again,
i
think
the
explicit
singling
out
of
persons
of
low
income
narrows
the
issue
that
is
here,
it
narrows
it
in
several
senses.
in
the
first
place,
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
the
group
against
to
whom
the
discrimination
runs.
second,
this
is
not
in
any
sense
a
shifting
group,
the
poor
identifiable
and
unfortunately
to
coherent
a
group
in
a
sense.
it’s
not
like
williams
and
rhodes
were
arguably
the
group
came
together
for
one
purpose
then
broke
up
later
or
like
westbrook
and
mihaly.
the
california
case
dealing
with
the
two-thirds
the
majority
required
for
a
bond
issue
where
one
could
say
that
the
group
was
temporary.
but
here,
it
is
a
continuing
group
--
a
group
who
are
experience
tells
us
a
particularly
subject
of
prejudice,
invidious
discriminations
in
the
area
of
housing.
this
brings
the
case
we
think
within
principles
of
this
court
has
often
noted
for
example
in
mcdonald
against
board
of
election
commissioners.
the
court
observed
that
discrimination
against
the
poor
was
enough
to
render
a
classification
highly
suspect
and
thereby
demand
the
more
exacting
judicial
scrutiny.
and
in
mr.
justice
harlan’s
dissenting
opinion
in
griffin
and
illinois,
he
noted
the
states
of
course
are
prohibited
by
the
equal
protection
clause
from
discriminating
between
rich
poor
as
such
in
the
formulation
and
application
of
their
laws.
in
this
statute,
we
submit
thus
precisely
then.
in
other
words,
to
summarize
what
i
have
said
thus
far
the
combination
of
an
explicit
separate
classification
of
the
poor
with
disadvantage
in
the
very
processes
by
which
governmental
decisions
are
reached
and
unexplained
by
the
consistent
application
of
any
neutral
or
general
principle,
we
think
if
it
is
not
enough
to
condemn
the
statute
out
of
hand
is
certainly
enough
to
put
upon
the
state
--
a
very
heavy
burden
of
justification.
and
i
turn
now
therefore
to
the
justifications
which
i
understand
to
have
been
offered,
they
fall
into
three
groups.
the
first
group
might
be
said
to
be
political,
that
is
it
has
to
do
with
the
organization
of
government
and
it
said
first
that
the
interest
in
popular
self-rule
or
popular
sovereignty
explains
the
line
which
california
has
drawn
here.
the
difficulty
is
that
while
there
is
of
course
an
interest
in
popular
self-government.
that
interest
does
not
explain
the
line
that
california
has
drawn,
the
discrimination
is
made.
there
are
other
items
that
do
not
require
this
automatic
referendum
in
which
there
is
exactly
the
same
interest
in
popular
self-government.
indeed,
in
this
respect,
the
case
is
no
different
from
hunter
and
erickson.
it
said
that
article
xxxiv
is
a
result
of
a
whole
that
developed
in
article
iv,
section
1
of
the
california
constitution.
well,
if
article
xxxiv
was
a
reaction,
it
was
an
overreaction
and
it’s
the
over
part
of
it
if
i
may
put
it
colloquially
that
we
say
that
discriminates
and
of
which
we
complain.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
is
such
an
interest
and
these
projects
they
will
be
less
contribution
by
the
government
because
it’s
limited
to
10%
of
the
shelter
rents
on
these
projects.
then
they’re
might
be
collected
if
the
full
value
of
the
project
was
taxed
as
if
it
was
privately
owned.
but
there
are
many
instances
mr.
chief
justice
in
california
where
projects
are
undertaken
some
by
the
government,
some
by
charities
and
other
private
institutions
where
land
and
buildings
equally
are
taken
off
the
tax
rolls
and
they
are
not
subject
to
referendum.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
never
said
with
government
building,
i
was
thinking
of
the
school
or
an
airport,
a
university,
medical
complex,
the
parks,
superhighways,
all
kinds
of
things
that
are
taken
off
the
tax
rolls
just
like
this.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
that
to
a
degree
and
of
course
this
is
what
the
court
has
said
in
upholding
public
housing
that
public
housing
serves
everyone.
i
would
submit
that
this
case
in
this
respect
is
very
like
shapiro
and
thompson
that
there
is
an
interest
that
the
people
have
in
asserting
physical
control.
but
that
that
interest
does
not
justify
discriminating
on
invidious
grounds
against
a
particular
class,
there,
it
was
a
different
class
than
here,
but
mr.
justice
brennan’s
opinion
is
very
explicit.
it
may
legitimately
attempt
to
limit
its
expenditures
or
i
would
say
take
things
off
the
tax
rolls
whether
for
public
assistance,
public
education
or
any
other
program.
but
the
state
may
not
accomplish
such
a
purpose
by
invidious
distinctions
between
classes
of
its
citizens.
and
i
think
to
say
while
we’re
going
to
be
concerned
about
public
expenditures
and
handle
this
differently
where
they
benefit
poor,
but
we’re
not
going
to
concern
them
or
where
the
primary
benefit
are
those
who
used
an
airport
or
those
who
used
their
superhighway
or
those
who
want
to
go
to
school
or
those
who
want
to
be
in
hospital
is
an
invidious
discrimination.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
think
if
the
only
thing
submitted
to
popular
referendum
on
a
continuing
basis
was
a
form
of
public
assistance
that
that
would
be
subject
to
an
argument
very
similar
to
ours
here,
yes.
but
it’s
again
i
think
it
is
singling
out
a
particular
class
and
saying
that
in
your
“claims”
if
i
may
use
the
word
in
the
loose
sense
against
government.
you
don’t
stand
the
same
way
everyone
else
does.
you
don’t
stand
the
way
merchants
do
when
they
want
improves
streets.
you
don’t
stand
the
way
that
public
does
when
it
wants
a
superhighway
or
parents
do
when
they
want
schools.
you
have
to
get
over
this
additional
higher
earning
and
it
does
seem
to
me
that
that's
just
wrong
that
it
puts
a
brand
on
the
poor
that
it
is
just
as
offensive
as
the
brand
of
race
in
other
cases.
now,
there's
one
other
set
of
justifications
offered
and
those
have
been
labeled
sociological
and
environmental.
mr.
atkinson
yesterday,
raised
the
specter
of
the
large
block
of
public
housing
that
we
have
seen
in
places
like
st.
louis;
we
have
one
in
hadley
and
cambridge.
that
just
in
fact
is
the
rationale
then
article
xxxiv
is
both
too
broad
and
too
narrow.
it’s
too
broad
because
public
housing
is
not
confined
to
that
kind
of
project.
it
involves
small
housing
units
and
very
similar
to
those
built
by
private
ownership.
indeed,
there's
no
better
illustration
that
may
one
in
this
record
that
was
voted
down
by
referendum
because
the
proposal
was
to
build
not
more
than
a
thousand
dwelling
units.
not
more
than
four
such
dwelling
units
situate
and
anyone
structure,
may
i
just
finish
reading
this
point.
not
more
than
one
structure
containing
any
such
dwelling
unit
shall
be
situate
on
anyone
lot,
this
is
record
29
and
such
dwelling
units
shall
be
disperse
upon
various
sections
of
the
city.
so
that
not
more
than
24
such
dwelling
units,
that
would
be
six
structures
at
the
most
you
see
shall
be
situate
within
a
radius
of
1500
feet
from
any
other
such
dwelling
unit.
so
that
what
is
--
put
to
referendum
here
is
a
far
broader
class
of
things,
it’s
too
broad
and
not
the
kind
of
things
to
which
the
rationale
is
suppose
to
apply.
similarly,
not
everything
to
which
the
rationale
it
might
apply
is
to
put
the
referendum,
but
as
i
say
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
form
of
referendum
that
i
just
referred
to
suggest
the
answer
to
the
question
you
raised
yesterday
about
how
would
you
put
the
question
affirmatively
to
the
voters
because
it
does
described
in
sufficient
terms
the
kind
of
project
that
would
be
or
might
be
put
to
them
to
require
in
blocking
up
the
project.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
a
continuing
rule
requiring
that
appropriations
for
public
relief
be
submitted
to
referendum
when
nothing
else
is
submitted
to
referendum
would
be
discrimination
against
the
poor
and
the
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
if
the
people
wish
to
determine
their
policies
even
handedly
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
missed
the
last
few
words.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
say,
if
the
people
as
we
do
in
where
i
live
determine
our
policies
in
town
meeting
with
everyone
attending.
i
don’t
think
this
court
could
say
that
that
was
unconstitutional
because
we
make
all
our
appropriations
that
way.
mr.
archibald
cox
in
the
original
constitution?
mr.
archibald
cox
as
if
it
was
as
a
substantive
policy
or
are
other
words
statute
that
abolished
our
relief,
i
don’t
think
we
could
--
we
certainly
wouldn’t
make
the
argument
we
do
here.
that
would
be
a
substantive
decision.
it
would
not
be
a
discrimination
built
into
the
structure
of
government.
whether
there
are
other
arguments
i
don’t
know,
but
it
wouldn’t
be
the
argument
we
make
here.
mr.
archibald
cox
certainly
not
on
the
ground,
no,
not
in
the
ground
we
are
now.
if
i
said
anything
to
contrary
to
that,
i
--
that's
just
slip
of
the
tongue.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
missed
understood
and
your
answer
mr.
justice
brennan
is
quite
right.
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
trying
to
distinguish
perhaps
i
become
confused.
i'm
trying
to
distinguish
between
a
decision
of
substantive
policy,
there
shall
be
no
housing
or
there
shall
be
no
relief
what
seems
to
me
to
be
one
question.
and
a
decision
that
builds
a
disadvantage
into
the
way
substantive
policies
are
made
which
i
say
under
hunter
and
erickson
is
like
waiting
votes
or
denying
vote
to
a
particular
class.
and
i
think
this
is
of
the
utmost
importance
because
saying
to
a
class
of
people
that
they
don’t
--
are
treated
and
particularly
to
a
class
of
people
subject
to
invidious
discrimination
that
they
don’t
stand
like
other
people.
the
decisions
affecting
them
ought
to
be
made
by
the
same
processes
as
decisions’
affecting
other
people
is
particularly
offensive
to
our
system
--
constitutional
system
of
government.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
if
--
i
don’t
think
if
california
were
to
repeal
its
statute
providing
for
accepting
public
housing
under
the
united
states
housing
act.
i
think
we
would
have
an
all
together
different
case.
because
again,
it
would
not
be
a
discrimination
built
into
the
way
decisions
are
reach.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes
that’s
true,
but
of
course
in
other
places
when
it
comes
to
discrimination
in
voting
or
when
it
comes
to
malapportionment
or
other
things
of
that
kind,
we
don’t
say
that
the
consequences
might
end
up
the
same
way.
indeed,
to
take
a
silly
example
that
occurred
to
me
on
the
way
up
here,
we
don’t
say
when
a
man
complains
that
he’s
been
put
on
trial
without
counsel.
well,
you
might
do
a
whole
lot
better
than
a
lot
of
lawyers
i’ve
heard
in
court.
it’s
the
fact
of
the
discrimination,
the
additional
hurdle
or
obstacle
or
in
the
singling
really
for
an
oppressive
brand
to
which
offends
me
that
i
think
makes
the
difference.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
my
analogy
doesn’t
help
on
the
discrimination.
it
was
meant
to
go
on
later
the
point
that
the
way
it
meant
to
argue
that
it
might
end
up
the
same
way
isn’t
an
answer
to
an
unconstitutional
action
by
the
state.
that
was
all
i
meant
just
a
minute.
mr.
archibald
cox
that’s
quite
right,
they
do
and
their
cases
are
exactly
the
same
in
that
respect.
mr.
archibald
cox
precisely,
very,
very
similar
indeed.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
precise
question
in
these
cases
as
i
understand
it
is
whether
the
state
may
require
local
government
action
which
would
provide
public
housing
for
the
poor,
for
persons
of
low-income.
mr.
archibald
cox
under
the
standards
in
the
federal
statute
one
can
take
roughly
the
$4,000.00
level
of
income
as
eligible
for
low-income
housing.
there
are
our
standards
that
i
set
forth
in
the
statute.
the
questions
is
whether
the
state
or
rather
--
yes
the
state
may
require
local
government
action
providing
low-rent
housing
for
the
poor
to
run
the
gauntlet
of
an
automatic
referendum
not
required
in
the
case
of
governmental
action.
in
behalf
of
any
other
group
in
the
community
and
we
think
because
of
the
fact
that
this
is
housing
for
the
benefit
of
persons
of
low-income
and
article
xxxiv
is
limited
to
that
case
that
this
is
a
situation
where
a
one
combines
a
discrimination
in
the
processes
of
government
with
an
invidious
classification
which
distinguishes
a
great
many
other
cases.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
is
the
referendum.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
the
special
referendum
to
these
people
which
we
complain
of
as
the
unconstitutional
discrimination
in
this
case,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
the
action
normally
is
taken
by
the
county
or
by
the
city
and
there
can
be
no
low-rent
housing
without
at
least
two
favorable
votes
by
the
county
board
of
supervisors
or
the
city
council.
indeed,
that's
the
way
we
contend
that
it
should
be
done.
it’s
this
extra
obstacle.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh!
excuse
me.
mr.
archibald
cox
that’s
alright
mr.
justice.
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
not
--
i
now
understand
what
you
mean
by
stock
but
i
don’t
understand
the
question,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
we’re
not
complaining
in
anyway
of
local
option
down
the
list.
there's
no
complaint
about
this
being
a
matter
of
local
option.
this
indeed
is
the
matter
determined
by
local
self-government
and
even
if
article
xxxiv
that's
wipe
up
of
us.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
do
not
and
they
said
up
to
the
classification
invidious
terms.
in
terms
of
this
being
a
benefit
for
people
of
low-income.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
there
can
be
no
neutral
classification,
no
neutral
principle
that
would
call
for
a
referendum
in
certain
kinds
of
case.
the
bond
issue
case
seems
to
me
to
be
accord
--
to
conform
to
a
neutral
principle.
i
would
think
the
referendum
that's
called
for
in
one
or
two
cities
in
california
for
on
any
question
of
giving
away
park
lot.
probably,
it
rests
upon
a
neutral
principle
of
disfavoring
the
disposition
of
open
parks
and
property.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i'm
referring
of
course
the
opinion
of
justice
stewart
and
justice
harlan
in
hunter
and
erickson.
i
mean
one
that
is
non-invidious,
one
that
is
not
rest
upon
distinctions
against
disfavored
classes.
race
was
the
one
involved
there.
we
say
that
they
have
that
case
identical
with
this
case
except
that
here
it’s
persons
of
low-income.
mr.
archibald
cox
except
for
the
fact
that
in
the
first
instance
the
disfavored
class
here
is
the
poor
rather
than
in
terms
of
race.
i
do
think
there's
no
other
difference
justice
harlan.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
--
mr.
archibald
cox
much
of
it
often
welfare
money
of
course.
mr.
archibald
cox
much
of
it
often
welfare
money
of
the
$4,000.00
a
year.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it
might
be.
it
doesn’t
enable
if
you
read
the
affidavits
in
the
record
of
the
conditions
under
which
these
people
are
living.
i
suggest
that
they
are
indigents
in
the
most
realistic
sense
of
the
word.
i
point
out
too
that
the
court,
mr.
justice
harlan
has
referred
to
property
classifications,
classifications
of
wealth
in
kramer,
in
cipriano,
and
the
phoenix
case
and
others
as
classifications
that
are
suspect
and
at
some
cases
has
drawn
that
kind
of
line.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
--
the
relationship
is
just
the
same
as
in
hunter
and
erickson.
mr.
archibald
cox
then
we
would
be
making
the
same
argument.
or
as
you
suggested
earlier,
if
this
provided
that
there
must
be
votes
by
five
successive
boards
of
supervisors,
we
would
be
making
the
same
argument.
mr.
archibald
cox
then
i
could
not
make
the
argument
i'm
making
now
and
the
chief
justice
stated
that
very
precisely
earlier
(voice
overlap).
i’m
saying
there
could
be
no
argument.
i
could
not
make
the
argument
i'm
making
today.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
would
have
to
be
on
a
different
ground,
that's
correct.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
i
think
it
would
--
we
would
probably
take
it
to
the
supreme
court
of
california
and
we
would
rely
chiefly
on
an
opinion
that
i
should
refer
your
honor
is
to
in
the
san
francisco
unified
school
district
against
johnson
in
92
california
reporter
309.
i
refer
to
that
case,
it’s
not
--
it
doesn’t
deal
with
article
xxxiv
i
don’t
want
to
mislead
you,
but
it
does
indicate
that
the
supreme
court
of
california
might
well
invalidate
article
xxxiv
on
the
ground
that
if
permits
and
even
invites
people
to
vote
against
low-cost
housing
on
racial
grounds.
the
california
court
says
that
inviting
people
to
vote
in
referenda
or
to
take
action
generally
was
there
speaking
of
parents
refusing
to
allow
their
children
to
be
assigned
outside
a
neighborhood
school
district.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
because
--
no,
no,
it’s
simply
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law.
there's
no
question
of
california
constitutional
law
because
this
in
the
california
constitution.
there
was
no
question
of
california
constitutional
law
i
believe
in
that
case,
it
was
decided
on
the
federal
government.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
yes,
so
that's
one
ground
and
would
probably
be
the
primary
ground
of
attack
here.
let
me
elaborate;
add
a
little
more
length
the
matter
of
the
mandatory
referendum.
mr.
lasky
says
that
there
are
other
instances
of
mandatory
referendum
and
of
course
he's
right.
he
describes
one
as
that
disposition
of
public
property.
what
he
means
of
course
is
the
occasional
provision
in
a
city
charter
which
deal
with
the
disposition
a
part
property.
there's
certainly
nothing
in
common
between
that
case
and
this
one.
he
speaks
of
burdens
on
the
general
taxpayer,
the
only,
the
section
he
refers
to
is
the
provision
of
the
california
constitution
which
requires
a
referendum
when
an
issue
of
bonds
or
other
general
debt
chargeable
against
the
government
state
or
local
government
is
involved.
and
we
point
out
as
i
suggested
yesterday,
many
instances
where
land
is
taken
off
the
tax
rolls
and
there
maybe
some
increase
demand
for
municipal
services
which
does
not
require
a
referendum
in
california.
incidentally,
justice
harlan,
i
believe
that
that
case
involving
the
california
bond
issue
and
the
requirement
of
a
two-thirds
vote
is
presently
before
the
court
in
westbrook
and
mihaly.
i
don’t
know
whether
it’s
been
argued
yet
but
the
matter
is
here.
then
the
third
category
that
he
refers
to
is
changes
in
the
boundaries
or
constitution
of
local
government.
i
know
nothing
in
common
between
this
case
and
that.
this
case
has
the
characteristics
that
i
refer
to
before,
the
built-in
disadvantage,
the
invidious
classification,
and
the
inability
to
explain
it
by
any
neutral
principle.
mr.
archibald
cox
now,
i’d
like
--
mr.
archibald
cox
of
course.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
wish
to
know
what
social
welfare
legislation
meant
justice
harlan.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
don’t
like
to
evade
the
--
i
really
do
find
it
difficult
to
know
just
what
you
mean
by
social
welfare
legislation
because
of
our
unemployment
insurance
laws
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
then
i
hope
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
then
i
have
hunter
and
erickson.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
hunter
and
erickson
is
the
same
case
we
have
here,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
maybe
i
didn’t
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
did.
i
thought
he
said
fair
housing,
i'm
very
sorry.
if
it
said
that
all
low-rent
housing
and
said
nothing
more
of,
i
would
then
have
virtually
the
same
case
i
have
now
except
that
this
is
facial
discrimination
of
which
i
do
find
particularly
offensive
somehow
putting
a
brand
but
i
think
it
be
in
substance.
the
same
case
probably
that
difference
is
by
(inaudible)
rather
than
the
real
one.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
say,
i
think
i
would
give
the
answer
that
i
gave
before
mr.
chief
justice
that
singling
out
interest
of
the
poor
whether
they
are
defined
as
social
welfare
and
that's
all
that
one
means
and
saying
that
they
must
be
treated
differently
in
the
process
of
reaching
decisions
in
government.
apparently,
just
because
it
is
the
poor
or
those
who
need
the
protection
of
social
welfare
legislation
is
invidious.
now,
here
i
do
have
and
i
don’t
want
to
give
way
too
much.
here,
we
do
have
some
closer
comparisons
to
make.
let
me
devote
myself
for
a
few
minutes
to
the
argument.
well,
what
is
the
discrimination?
what
are
the
two
things
that
this
discrimination
between?
and
there
are
four
points
i
would
like
to
make
in
this
connection.
the
first
is
that
california
draws
a
much
nicer
line
that
much
of
the
appellant’s
argument
supposes.
under
urban
renewal
projects,
it
is
very
common
for
a
public
authority
to
acquire
a
site,
clear
it,
and
sell
it
at
less
than
cost
to
a
private
operator
who
constructs
a
multi-unit
housing
upon
the
track
such
as
high
rise
apartment
and
the
sale
less
than
cost
is
clearly
a
form
of
public
subsidy.
there
is
upper
income
housing
on
urban
renewal
sites
at
sta.
monica
shores;
bunker
hill
which
i
found
in
my
amazement
was
in
los
angeles
and
not
charleston,
massachusetts,
seaside,
diamond
heights,
glen
park
were
nominated
for
example.
now,
another
thing
that
is
done
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
it
maybe,
i
guess
it
is
subject
to
a
petition
referendum.
i
think
i'm
not
certain
of
that
but
i
know
it
is
not
subject
to
an
automatic
referendum.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
yes
and
again
of
course,
our
case
would
be
entirely
different.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
their
difference
is
--
mr.
archibald
cox
differences
are
three.
one
is
that
those
who
oppose
this
step
was
must
go
out
and
get
the
5%
or
8%
of
the
voters
and
have
the
burden
of
carrying.
a
second
difference
which
may
be
somewhat
formal,
but
which
i
think
as
psychological
significance
under
the
mandatory
referendum,
you
can't
do
anything
until
an
affirmative
vote
is
been
held,
whereas
the
petition
referendum
in
a
fact
shall
we
over
turn
what
our
local
authorities
have
gone.
and
then
the
third
point,
as
i
suggested
yesterday,
the
mandatory
referendum
under
article
xxxiv
works
only
one
way.
now,
there
are
other
kinds
of
housing
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
if
it
was
cut
down
to
that
small
number,
then
there
might
be
a
different
case,
but
i
suggest
that
5%
to
8%
is
not
a
mere
formality.
again,
of
course
i
cite
hunter
and
erickson
as
authority
for
that
proposition.
i
think
those
who
tried
to
get
5%
or
8%
of
the
voters
on
signature
would
agree
that
it
is
not
just
a
formality.
now,
i
can
go
a
little
further
on
the
matter
of
housing
not
only
is
the
matter
of
transferring
the
site
at
less
than
cost
under
urban
renewal.
but
there
are
occasions
when
the
construction
itself
is
subsidized
by
fha
conventions
which
reduced
the
interest
that
the
real
estate
development
has
to
pay
because
the
fha
pays
the
difference
between
what
he
can
pay
in
the
way
of
interest
from
the
rents
and
what
a
mortgagee
would
require.
and
sometimes
there
are
rent
supplements
paid
in
such
cases.
if
the
sponsor
is
a
non-profit
institution
and
there
are
projects
being
developed
this
way
then
the
interest
rate
is
lower.
and
often
there
is
--
what
in
fact
is
an
important
aid
and
that
the
federal
government
takes
the
mortgage
when
no
one
else
will.
now,
i'm
talking
about
vagueness
that
the
california
municipalities
are
involved
in
because
it’s
urban
renewal
land.
and
in
these
cases,
i
really
don’t
see
any
relevant
difference
between
the
middle-income
housing
project
and
the
low-rent
project
which
article
xxxiv
has
aimed.
both
are
housing,
both
have
at
least
some
attributes
government
projects,
both
are
publicly
subsidized
and
i've
not
yet
heard
anyone
suggest
why
the
difference
and
where
the
title
resides.
i
should
make
justify
a
difference
in
their
treatment
in
local
government.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
there
is
a
difference
but
i
point
out
again
the
very
large
number
of
instances
in
which
land
is
taken
off
the
tax
rolls
by
public
or
private
action.
and
california
doesn’t
require
automatic
referendum
then.
the
second
point
that
i
would
emphasize
simply
by
way
of
recalling
it
is
i
pointed
out
yesterday,
other
government
action
having
all
the
characteristics
of
low-rent
housing
except
the
involvement
of
the
poor
is
not
required
to
go
to
an
automatic
referendum
in
california.
in
other
words,
no
matter
what
comparison
you
make,
other
groups
aren’t
treated
the
same.
mr.
archibald
cox
highways
and
airports
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
but
not
just
federal
also
state
changes
it
--
yes?
mr.
archibald
cox
i
just
described
the
closest
(voice
overlap)
that
i
know.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
true.
but
then
i
think
there's
a
further
point
justice
stewart.
i
think
the
appellant’s
argument
and
our
inability
to
point
to
some
exact
comparison
where
the
only
difference
is
the
involvement
of
the
poor
that
that
difficulty
has
got
over
by
hunter
and
erickson.
rarely,
the
claim
that
we
can't
show
that
discrimination
against
the
poor
results
from
the
article
xxxiv
because
we
can't
show
any
high
income
housing
owned
by
the
government
just
like
this
is
sort
of
a
pale
copy
of
the
argument
that
the
akron
charter
amendment
was
nondiscriminatory
because
whites
as
well
as
blacks,
protestants
as
well
as
catholics
who
were
seeking
fair
housing
legislation
had
to
go
to
a
referendum.
here
is
that
the
reality
is
that
the
law’s
impact
falls
under
minority.
mr.
archibald
cox
then
if
a
public
housing
--
we
wouldn’t
because
if
a
public
housing
project
within
the
zoning
line
could
be
built
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
don’t
--
i
would
submit
that
it
wasn’t
as
invidious.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
property
development
and
zoning
laws
affecting
property
development
are
too
much
less
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
wouldn’t
say
that
there
could
never
be
any
classification
based
on
non-property
owning.
i
want
to
know
in
what
context
it
did
arose
and
also
what
subject
it
related
to.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
in
this
context
[laughter
attempt]
i
think
that
it’s
a
discriminatory
classification.
mr.
archibald
cox
all
changes
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
think
that
one
could
be
sustained
and
the
other
should
be
rejected,
yes.
because
i
think
the
zoning
laws
is
a
sufficiently
broad
in
general
subject
that
it
does
not
single
out
people
who
are
subject
to
prejudice
in
order
to
discriminate
against
them
in
seeking
their
needs.
may
i
develop
that
part
people
who
are
subject
prejudice
just
a
little
bit
further?
this
of
course
is
a
law
which
raises
a
--
puts
under
a
legal
disadvantage
persons
who
are
in
the
low-income
group.
it’s
not
an
argument
here
that
the
law
works
harder
on
those
who
have
that
money
than
on
those
who
have
it
when
the
law
is
written
in
a
nondiscriminatory
fashion
in
its
terms.
second,
it
seems
to
me
that
when
speaking
of
the
political
process
or
the
structure
of
government
it
is
proper
to
characterize
the
poor
as
an
insular
and
discreet
minority.
that
phrase
has
been
used
in
constitutional
law.
next,
i
would
emphasize
that
discrimination
against
the
poor
is
in
very
large
degree
--
a
form
of
racial
or
religious
discrimination.
it’s
in
fact,
all
over
the
country
minorities
form
a
disproportionate
part
of
the
poor.
the
douglas
report
stated
that
it
is
of
1967,
41%
of
the
poor
using
the
$4,000.00
limit
to
describe
the
poor;
41%
of
the
nonwhite
were
poor
and
only
12%
of
the
white.
if
you
look
at
the
population
as
a
whole,
32%
are
poor
nonwhite
--
no,
32%
of
the
nonwhite
are
poor
and
only
12%
of
the
general
population
is
nonwhite.
in
sta.
clara,
one
find
is
looking
not
at
the
black
population
but
at
the
mexican-americans
that
15.2%
of
all
households
have
incomes
below
$4,000.00
but
26.8%
of
the
mexican-americans
have
income
below
$4,000.00.
and
as
the
opinion
below
points
out,
i
won't
stop
to
read
it
in
the
footnote.
it’s
the
minorities
who
have
the
intense
need
for
housing.
indeed,
the
president’s
commission
on
housing
pointed
out
that
the
need
for
housing
among
minority
was
three
times
as
intense.
minorities
of
course
form
the
great
black
of
people
who
are
the
occupants
of
low-rent
public
housing
and
when
people
vote
on
these
questions
as
the
affidavits
in
the
record
make
clear.
there
is
not
much
doubt
on
that
what
is
on
the
agenda
is
the
unwise
poor
--
the
minorities
whose
housing
is
more
notably
inadequate
than
everyone
else
is.
there
are
two
other
consequences
which
i
can't
say
are
written
into
the
statute
and
which
i
don’t
make
our
case
turn
exclusively
on
but
other
point
but
i
think
there’re
important
consequences
in
deciding
whether
this
is
an
invidious
classification.
they
go
very
closely
together.
the
great
problem
in
housing
and
the
great
problems
that
result
from
it
come
from
the
difficulties
that
persons
of
low-income
have
in
moving
to
communities
where
the
better
jobs
are,
where
there
is
opportunity
for
self-help
and
advancement.
and
i
suppose
there
are
two
no
better
are
examples
anywhere
in
the
country
than
san
mateo
county
as
one
goes
down
on
the
peninsula
in
california
and
san
jose
down
at
the
end
of
the
bank.
and
the
problem
is
that
there
is
no
housing
for
people
to
move
into
those
areas
so
that
here
there
is
an
indirect
restraint,
i
don’t
liken
it
to
shapiro
and
thompson.
there
is
an
indirect
restraint
on
freedom
of
movement
to
go
and
help
themselves
and
there
is
also
of
course
a
resulting,
built-in
house
preservation
of
the
ghettos.
because
this
kind
of
obstacle
makes
it
difficult
to
build
the
necessary
public
housing
units
in
counties
like
sta.
clara
and
san
mateo
and
that
too
results
in
racial
discrimination.
it
seems
to
me
as
i
say
in
deciding
whether
this
is
an
invidious
classification,
a
distinction
against
the
persons
of
low-income
who
can't
afford
this
housing
that
these
consequences
are
properly
taken
into
account.
but
the
heart
of
my
case
rests
on
the
combination
as
i
have
said
too
many
times,
i'm
afraid,
of
the
built-in
disadvantage
not
required
on
any
other
kind
of
interest
of
any
other
group.
the
expressed
classification
of
persons
of
low-income
and
the
other
absence
of
any
neutral
principle
which
california
can
be
said
to
have
followed
in
setting
up
the
classes
of
those
required
to
go
to
an
automatic
referendum.
taking
those
together
mr.
chief
justice,
we
submit
that
there
is
a
denial
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
law.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
--
because
the
students
couldn’t
vote.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
guess
you
took
care
of
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
that
the
character
of
the
bond
issue
provision
is
one
which
is
a
general
one
relating
to
all
bond
issues
is
one
that
cuts
against
one
group
today
and
another
group
tomorrow.
and
therefore,
one
can
say
that
this
category
was
set
up
according
to
a
uniform
rule
that
doesn’t
point
the
finger
at
any
group
in
the
community
that
says
where
we’re
incurring
long
term
debt,
the
kind
of
thing
of
course
which
in
the
history
if
the
country
frequently
resulted
in
insolvency
of
cities
and
counties.
when
we’re
talking
about
long-term
debt,
we
want
to
go
more
slowly.
so
we
will
set
up
a
separate
governmental
manner
of
dealing
with
that
group
provisions.
that
doesn’t
seem
to
me
to
involve
any
invidious
classification.
you
do
have
the
question
here
whether
two-thirds
can
be
required.
the
supreme
court
of
california
held
that
two-thirds
could
not
constitutionally
be
required,
of
course
we’re
not.
i
just
recalling
that
for
the
court’s
benefit
we’re
not
involved
in
that
and
i'm
certainly
not
arguing
the
merits
to
that
question.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
appellees
briefs
we’ve
canvassed
the
number
of
grounds
which
we
believe
that
article
xxxiv
of
the
california
constitution
violates
both
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
supremacy
clause.
in
my
oral
argument,
i
intend
to
confine
myself
to
the
essence
of
our
argument
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
it
very
briefly
is
this,
it’s
that
article
xxxiv
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
because
it
builds
into
the
very
structure
of
government,
of
local
government
in
california
an
explicit
discrimination
against
the
poor.
in
the
words
of
the
statute
against
persons
of
low
income
who
are
defined,
i
should
say
of
the
constitution
article
xxxiv,
who
are
defined
as
persons
whose
income
is
insufficient
to
provide
them
with
safe,
decent
and
sanitary
housing
without
overcrowding.
the
discrimination
here
as
in
hunter
against
erickson
consists
of
putting
the
poor
the
disadvantaged
class,
putting
before
them
a
special
obstacle
which
they
must
surmount
in
order
to
secure
government
action
in
their
behalf
which
faces
no
other
group
seeking
government
action
in
its
behalf.
hunter
and
erickson
held
that
that
very
kind
of
discrimination
was
unconstitutional
where
it
ran
against
racial
minorities.
our
contention
is,
that
it
is
equally
unconstitutional
where
it
runs
explicitly
against
the
poor
and
for
the
most
part
in
practice
also
against
racial
minority.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
that
it
would
--
i’m
not
quite
sure
mr.
chief
justice
what
you
mean
by
public
housing
if
it
said
all
--
mr.
archibald
cox
if
it
said
all
subsidized
housing
by
the
federal
or
state
government.
then,
i
think
we
would
have
a
somewhat
different
case
because
here
there
clearly
is
discrimination
between
subsidized,
middle
income
and
upper
income
housing
which
is
subsidized
by
the
federal
government
and
low
rental
housing
for
the
poor.
but
i’m
not
sure
that
there
wouldn’t
still
be
an
argument
that
the
poor
who
would
be
still
the
chief
ones
in
need
of
housing
and
the
chief
beneficiaries
of
housing
where
the
victims
of
a
discrimination
taking
a
somewhat
broader
universe
and
looking
at
kinds
of
local
government
action
more
broadly
as
the
court
did,
indeed
as
all
the
justices
did
in
hunter
and
erickson.
but
for
our
purposes,
that
case
can
be
left
to
another
day.
indeed,
i
think
here
and
as
i
shall
try
to
show
a
little
farther
on,
whatever
comparison
you
take,
there
is
no
neutral
principle
that
will
explain
this
discrimination.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
you
say
zoning
--
if
there
were
--
let
me
change
your
honor’s
example
just
a
little
bit
because
it
--
when
occurred
that’s
very
likely.
and
that
is
if
the
zoning
laws
required
that
all
housing
above
certain
numbers
of
units
be
submitted
the
referendum,
then
we
would
have
a
different
question,
that
would
cover
high
rise
apartments
for
middle
income
and
well
to
do,
and
it
would
certainly
be
arguable
that
there
was
some
neutral
principles
so
i
think
that
case
is
really
very
different
from
mine.
i
planned
to
develop
the
argument
which
i
just
get
in
four
steps.
the
first
is
that
article
xxxiv
unquestionably
i
think
erects
a
special
obstacle
in
front
of
persons
of
low
income
in
seeking
to
have
their
need
for
government
action
to
fulfill
one
of
their
greatest
necessities.
having
the
government
act
to
fill
it
as
compared
with
any
other
group,
in
order
to
get
any
housing
project,
public
housing
project
under
way
in
california
quite
apart
from
article
xxxiv,
there
must
either
have
been
or
must
be
in
the
future
of
four
principle
steps.
the
first
would
be
state
legislation
empowering
the
municipalities
to
accept
the
benefits
of
the
housing
act
--
federal
housing
act
of
1937
and
constituting
local
housing
authorities,
that
step
has
been
taken.
the
next
step
is
the
passage
of
a
resolution
by
the
county
government
or
the
city
government
as
the
case
maybe,
activating
its
housing
authority
and
that
step
has
been
taken
in
both
san
mateo
county
and
in
the
city
of
san
jose,
the
two
units
involved
in
these
cases.
then
the
third
step
is
a
preliminary
application
for
funds
to
prepare
the
drawings,
get
the
estimates,
take
the
other
steps
to
get
a
housing
project
underway.
and
that
application
must
be
approved
by
the
board
of
supervisors
for
the
county
or
by
the
city
council
for
the
city
by
resolution
in
the
same
manner
as
local
government
action
is
normally
taken.
and
at
that
time
too
by
resolution,
the
local
subdivision
must
enter
into
an
agreement
of
cooperation
with
the
federal
housing
authority.
so,
you
have
municipal
action
according
to
the
normal
channels
at
that
step.
then
the
fourth
step
of
course,
would
be
approving
the
plans
for
the
project,
approving
the
bonds
and
the
various
other
mechanics
to
occurring
it
out.
and
i
would
emphasize
that
under
california
law,
at
that
step
again
the
local
legislative
body
is
required
to
approve
the
particular
project.
now
what
the
article
xxxiv
does
is
to
say
in
addition
to
those
things,
persons
of
low
income
who
are
seeking
this
kind
of
government
action
in
relief
of
their
needs
must
go
automatically
to
a
referendum
in
which
they
secure
popular
approval
of
the
project.
this
is
an
additional
step
to
what
would
be
required
for
any
other
effective
kind
of
action
by
the
local
government
with
the
exception
of
issues
of
general
revenue
bonds
which
i’ll
deal
with
a
little
later.
the
disadvantage
which
is
expressly
put
on
the
poor
by
article
xxxiv
is
exactly
the
same
i
point
out
as
the
disadvantage
under
which
the
ordinance
in
hunter
and
erickson
put
those
who
were
interested
in
fair
housing
legislation.
in
akron
as
in
san
jose
there
was
a
general
provision
for
a
referendum
on
petition
of
a
stated
number
of
citizens,
but
the
charter
amendment
in
the
akron
case
called
for
an
automatic
referendum.
and
the
court
said
there
that
the
difference
was
enough
to
constitute
a
denial
of
equal
protection.
the
differences
here
is
exactly
the
same
and
we
say
that
it
too
constitutes
a
denial
of
equal
protection.
some
argument
is
made
in
the
briefs
that
was
made
a
few
minutes
ago
by
counsel
to
the
effect
that
article
4
section
1
of
the
california
constitution
provides
for
a
referendum
and
thus
there
is
no
discrimination
in
this
case.
i
find
out
that
there
are
three
major
differences.
first,
article
4
section
1
does
not
provide
for
an
automatic
referendum,
it
provides
for
a
referendum
only
on
petition
of
a
stated
number
of
vote,
5%
or
8%
depending
on
the
area
we’re
talking
about.
second,
the
normal
referendum
in
california
comes
after
the
subdivision
or
the
legislator
has
acted.
and
the
action
is
effective
unless
beat
out
by
the
voters.
here,
the
referendum
must
be
held
before
anything
effective
can
be
done.
and
the
third,
and
very
important
point
is
that
article
xxxiv
sets
up
a
one
way
street
or
it
may
be
used
to
defeat
housing
but
it
may
never
be
used
to
obtain
housing
whereas
the
normal
initiative
in
referendum
are
linked
together
and
they
may
operate
both
ways.
and
we
submit
that
these
three
differences
make
a
clear
cut
disadvantage
of
such
a
kind
as
denies
the
equal
protection
of
the
law.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
i
would
supposed
--
we
would
have
a
very
different
case
mr.
chief
justice,
if
what
article
xxxiv
did
was
to
subject
public
housing
project
to
the
normal
initiative
and
referendum
provisions
of
the
california
constitution.
did
you
ask
how
would
i
phrase
the
referendum?
mr.
archibald
cox
to
the
voters?
mr.
archibald
cox
i
suppose,
it
would,
yes.
shall
the
local
housing
authority,
they
authorized
and
directed
to
enter
in
the
contracts
with
the
federal
government
for
such
and
such
a
number
of
units
of
housing.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
it
could
even
say
at
a
particular
place
or
particular
places
since
the
housing
is
now
in
chiefly
in
smaller
blocks
then
some
of
the
housing
projects
that
were
described
to
us.
i
would
point
out
in
addition
that
this
not
only
operates
as
a
disadvantage
against
poor
as
in
hunter
and
erickson
but
that
there
is
no
neutral
principle
which
can
be
invoked
to
justify.
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
our
argument
does
not
challenge
the
right
of
the
voters
of
california
to
reserve
housing
and
other
like
questions
for
popular
approval
provided
that
it
is
done
in
accordance
with
some
neutral
principle
and
then
one
gets
the
problem
with
defining
the
class
that
i
was
discussing
an
answer
to
the
chief
justice’s
question.
all
the
important
characteristics
and
consequences
of
publicly
owned
housing
projects
of
a
low
cost
variety
other
than
the
involvement
of
persons
of
low
income
attached
to
other
species
of
government
action.
california
does
not
treat
any
of
them
as
a
cause
for
requiring
an
automatic
referendum.
for
example,
federal
financing
isn’t
the
reason
for
an
automatic
referendum
in
any
number
of
context.
urban
renewal
projects,
highways,
airports,
hospitals,
other
things
of
that
kind,other
than
effect
upon
land
use
isn’t
otherwise
treated
as
a
need
for
a
referendum.
well,
the
zoning
laws
can
be
changed
in
ways
that
permit
shopping
centers,
industrial
plants,
high
rise
apartments
that
will
change
the
character
of
the
land
for
generations.
indeed
public
ownership
of
projects
that
will
affect
the
character
of
the
land
for
generations
is
not
generally
treated
as
a
reason
for
requiring
mandatory
popular
approval.
again
airports,
sewage
disposal
plants,
educational
buildings
and
urban
renewal
are
example.
nor
can
it
be
said
fairly
i
think,
that
the
possible
increase
demand
for
municipal
services
resulting
from
a
publicly
owned
housing
project
is
a
neutral
reason
for
requiring
a
referendum
because
there
are
plenty
of
other
changes
attendant
upon
municipal
law
which
will
create
a
need
for
additional
services
but
they
are
not
made
the
basis
for
a
mandatory
referendum,
universities,
medical
complexes,
sports
stadiums,
hospitals,
universities
and
the
like.
the
lessening
of
tax
revenues
is
suggested
by
the
appellants
as
a
neutral
principle
which
certainly
not
everything
that
takes
land
of
the
tax
rows
even
for
public
ownership
is
submitted
to
referendum
in
california.
in
california
there
are
only
two
so
far
as
i
know,
kinds
of
mandatory
referendum.
one
is
a
change
in
political
boundaries
or
the
structure
of
local
government.
well,
article
xxxiv
make
such
a
change
that
the
vote
taken
under
it
on
a
housing
isn’t
a
vote
on
a
change
in
the
political
structure
or
political
boundaries.
the
other
mandatory
referendum
is
required
in
the
case
of
the
issuance
of
bonds
which
are
--
or
bonds
of
the
state,
county,
city
or
other
subdivision
of
the
government
and
which
constitute
an
obligation
paid
out
of
general
tax
revenues.
the
california
supreme
court
pointed
out
that
there
are
two
important
differences
here
between
general
municipal
obligations
and
the
bonds
of
the
housing
authority.
one
is
that
the
housing
authorities
bonds
are
not
obligations
of
the
city,
county,
state
or
other
public
subdivision
as
required
in
the
california
constitution.
second,
they
most
clearly
are
not
obligations
that
must
be
paid
out
of
general
tax
revenues.
the
bonds
are
paid
by
the
federal
government
and
to
some
small
extent
by
any
surplus
rents
over
cost
of
maintenance
of
the
building,
but
usually
they
are
not,
so
in
fact
the
bonds
are
obligations
to
the
federal
government
and
are
paid
by
the
federal
government.
in
sum
i
think
the
indisputable
purpose
and
effect
of
article
xxxiv
is
to
erect
this
special
obstacle
in
the
path
of
the
poor
when
they
seek
government
action
that
does
not
confront
any
other
group
when
it
is
seeking
political
or
governmental
action
in
its
behalf.
our
second
main
point
which
i’ll
develop
tomorrow
is
to
emphasize
that
article
xxxiv
builds
it’s
unique
bias
against
the
poor
into
the
very
structure
of
the
political
system,
person
of
low
income,
seeking
government
assistance
are
told
in
effect,
will
you
stand
differently
before
your
government
than
anyone
else
stands
when
he
is
seeking
government
assistance.
i
emphasize
this
because
this
is
not
a
case
let’s
say
like
3953
williams
where
one
was
dealing
with
substantive
government
policies
and
where
the
court
said
there
was
greater
latitude
in
social
and
economic
matters.
here
we’re
dealing
with
the
structure
of
government
itself.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
suggested
yesterday
that
our
submission
that
article
xxxiv
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
could
conveniently
be
approached
in
four
steps.
the
first
which
i
covered
was
to
show
that
the
indisputable
purpose
and
effect
of
article
xxxiv
is
to
erect
an
obstacle
in
the
perils
of
the
poor
when
they
seek
governmental
action
to
supply
their
need
for
housing.
it
does
not
confront
any
other
group
seeking
governmental
action
to
satisfy
its
demands
on
the
political
system
and
that
the
provisions
for
the
automatic
referendum
cannot
be
explained
by
the
consistent
application
of
any
neutral
or
general
principle.
our
second
main
point
is
to
emphasize
that
article
xxxiv
builds
its
unique
bias
into
the
very
structure
of
the
political
system
into
the
very
core
of
government
itself.
i
stress
that
point
also
its
obvious
for
this
reason.
it’s
quite
clear
that
in
working
out
substantive
policies
lines
must
be
drawn
by
government
and
sometimes
those
lines
are
very
difficult
ones
as
in
dandridge
v.
williams.
it’s
also
clear
that
substantive
policies
when
developed
by
government
sometimes
operate
more
harshly
against
one
class
than
against
another.
an
example
is
the
currently
much
publicized
litigations
so
not
in
this
court
attacking
zoning
laws
on
the
ground
that
they
fenced
the
poor
out
of
communities.
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that
we’re
not
asking
the
court
to
render
a
decision
that
has
any
impact
upon
those
kinds
of
questions.
here,
the
bias
is
in
the
way
decision
are
reached
by
the
political
community
and
it
seems
to
us
that
not
only
narrows
the
issue
but
that
it
makes
the
discrimination
a
great
deal
more
wrong,
it’s
a
discrimination,
like
discrimination
in
voting
or
in
apportionment
or
even
in
the
way
one
stands
before
the
court.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don’t
think
one
can
say
that
there
is
any
proof
that
the
thinking
of
those
who
voted
to
put
this
into
the
constitution
was
that
there's
any
proof
that
it
was
racially
motivated.
we
do
know
that
in
its
operation
since
it
bears
upon
the
poor
it
bears
more
harshly
upon
minorities
than
it
does
on
any
other
group.
that’s
particularly
true
in
the
area
of
housing.
i
do
intend
to
develop
that
point
a
little
bit
before
the
two
arguments
are
over.
but
i
think
that
this
being
a
discrimination
built
into
the
political
system
that
the
case
comes
within
what
was
said
in
hunter
and
erickson.
the
state
may
no
more
disadvantage
any
particular
group
by
making
it
more
difficult
to
enact
legislation
in
its
behalf
that
it
may
dilute
any
person’s
vote
or
given
a
group
a
smaller
representation
than
others
of
comparable
size.
the
third
main
point
i
would
wish
to
emphasize
is
that
on
the
face
of
this
statute,
it
singles
out
for
separate
classification
the
poor
or
in
the
words
of
the
statute
persons
of
low
income.
and
persons
of
low
income
are
defined
as
persons
or
families
who
let
the
amount
of
income
which
is
necessary
to
enable
them
and
to
live
in
decent,
safe,
and
sanitary
dwellings
without
overcrowding.
again,
i
think
the
explicit
singling
out
of
persons
of
low
income
narrows
the
issue
that
is
here,
it
narrows
it
in
several
senses.
in
the
first
place,
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
the
group
against
to
whom
the
discrimination
runs.
second,
this
is
not
in
any
sense
a
shifting
group,
the
poor
identifiable
and
unfortunately
to
coherent
a
group
in
a
sense.
it’s
not
like
williams
and
rhodes
were
arguably
the
group
came
together
for
one
purpose
then
broke
up
later
or
like
westbrook
and
mihaly.
the
california
case
dealing
with
the
two-thirds
the
majority
required
for
a
bond
issue
where
one
could
say
that
the
group
was
temporary.
but
here,
it
is
a
continuing
group
--
a
group
who
are
experience
tells
us
a
particularly
subject
of
prejudice,
invidious
discriminations
in
the
area
of
housing.
this
brings
the
case
we
think
within
principles
of
this
court
has
often
noted
for
example
in
mcdonald
against
board
of
election
commissioners.
the
court
observed
that
discrimination
against
the
poor
was
enough
to
render
a
classification
highly
suspect
and
thereby
demand
the
more
exacting
judicial
scrutiny.
and
in
mr.
justice
harlan’s
dissenting
opinion
in
griffin
and
illinois,
he
noted
the
states
of
course
are
prohibited
by
the
equal
protection
clause
from
discriminating
between
rich
poor
as
such
in
the
formulation
and
application
of
their
laws.
in
this
statute,
we
submit
thus
precisely
then.
in
other
words,
to
summarize
what
i
have
said
thus
far
the
combination
of
an
explicit
separate
classification
of
the
poor
with
disadvantage
in
the
very
processes
by
which
governmental
decisions
are
reached
and
unexplained
by
the
consistent
application
of
any
neutral
or
general
principle,
we
think
if
it
is
not
enough
to
condemn
the
statute
out
of
hand
is
certainly
enough
to
put
upon
the
state
--
a
very
heavy
burden
of
justification.
and
i
turn
now
therefore
to
the
justifications
which
i
understand
to
have
been
offered,
they
fall
into
three
groups.
the
first
group
might
be
said
to
be
political,
that
is
it
has
to
do
with
the
organization
of
government
and
it
said
first
that
the
interest
in
popular
self-rule
or
popular
sovereignty
explains
the
line
which
california
has
drawn
here.
the
difficulty
is
that
while
there
is
of
course
an
interest
in
popular
self-government.
that
interest
does
not
explain
the
line
that
california
has
drawn,
the
discrimination
is
made.
there
are
other
items
that
do
not
require
this
automatic
referendum
in
which
there
is
exactly
the
same
interest
in
popular
self-government.
indeed,
in
this
respect,
the
case
is
no
different
from
hunter
and
erickson.
it
said
that
article
xxxiv
is
a
result
of
a
whole
that
developed
in
article
iv,
section
1
of
the
california
constitution.
well,
if
article
xxxiv
was
a
reaction,
it
was
an
overreaction
and
it’s
the
over
part
of
it
if
i
may
put
it
colloquially
that
we
say
that
discriminates
and
of
which
we
complain.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
is
such
an
interest
and
these
projects
they
will
be
less
contribution
by
the
government
because
it’s
limited
to
10%
of
the
shelter
rents
on
these
projects.
then
they’re
might
be
collected
if
the
full
value
of
the
project
was
taxed
as
if
it
was
privately
owned.
but
there
are
many
instances
mr.
chief
justice
in
california
where
projects
are
undertaken
some
by
the
government,
some
by
charities
and
other
private
institutions
where
land
and
buildings
equally
are
taken
off
the
tax
rolls
and
they
are
not
subject
to
referendum.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
never
said
with
government
building,
i
was
thinking
of
the
school
or
an
airport,
a
university,
medical
complex,
the
parks,
superhighways,
all
kinds
of
things
that
are
taken
off
the
tax
rolls
just
like
this.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
that
to
a
degree
and
of
course
this
is
what
the
court
has
said
in
upholding
public
housing
that
public
housing
serves
everyone.
i
would
submit
that
this
case
in
this
respect
is
very
like
shapiro
and
thompson
that
there
is
an
interest
that
the
people
have
in
asserting
physical
control.
but
that
that
interest
does
not
justify
discriminating
on
invidious
grounds
against
a
particular
class,
there,
it
was
a
different
class
than
here,
but
mr.
justice
brennan’s
opinion
is
very
explicit.
it
may
legitimately
attempt
to
limit
its
expenditures
or
i
would
say
take
things
off
the
tax
rolls
whether
for
public
assistance,
public
education
or
any
other
program.
but
the
state
may
not
accomplish
such
a
purpose
by
invidious
distinctions
between
classes
of
its
citizens.
and
i
think
to
say
while
we’re
going
to
be
concerned
about
public
expenditures
and
handle
this
differently
where
they
benefit
poor,
but
we’re
not
going
to
concern
them
or
where
the
primary
benefit
are
those
who
used
an
airport
or
those
who
used
their
superhighway
or
those
who
want
to
go
to
school
or
those
who
want
to
be
in
hospital
is
an
invidious
discrimination.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
think
if
the
only
thing
submitted
to
popular
referendum
on
a
continuing
basis
was
a
form
of
public
assistance
that
that
would
be
subject
to
an
argument
very
similar
to
ours
here,
yes.
but
it’s
again
i
think
it
is
singling
out
a
particular
class
and
saying
that
in
your
“claims”
if
i
may
use
the
word
in
the
loose
sense
against
government.
you
don’t
stand
the
same
way
everyone
else
does.
you
don’t
stand
the
way
merchants
do
when
they
want
improves
streets.
you
don’t
stand
the
way
that
public
does
when
it
wants
a
superhighway
or
parents
do
when
they
want
schools.
you
have
to
get
over
this
additional
higher
earning
and
it
does
seem
to
me
that
that's
just
wrong
that
it
puts
a
brand
on
the
poor
that
it
is
just
as
offensive
as
the
brand
of
race
in
other
cases.
now,
there's
one
other
set
of
justifications
offered
and
those
have
been
labeled
sociological
and
environmental.
mr.
atkinson
yesterday,
raised
the
specter
of
the
large
block
of
public
housing
that
we
have
seen
in
places
like
st.
louis;
we
have
one
in
hadley
and
cambridge.
that
just
in
fact
is
the
rationale
then
article
xxxiv
is
both
too
broad
and
too
narrow.
it’s
too
broad
because
public
housing
is
not
confined
to
that
kind
of
project.
it
involves
small
housing
units
and
very
similar
to
those
built
by
private
ownership.
indeed,
there's
no
better
illustration
that
may
one
in
this
record
that
was
voted
down
by
referendum
because
the
proposal
was
to
build
not
more
than
a
thousand
dwelling
units.
not
more
than
four
such
dwelling
units
situate
and
anyone
structure,
may
i
just
finish
reading
this
point.
not
more
than
one
structure
containing
any
such
dwelling
unit
shall
be
situate
on
anyone
lot,
this
is
record
29
and
such
dwelling
units
shall
be
disperse
upon
various
sections
of
the
city.
so
that
not
more
than
24
such
dwelling
units,
that
would
be
six
structures
at
the
most
you
see
shall
be
situate
within
a
radius
of
1500
feet
from
any
other
such
dwelling
unit.
so
that
what
is
--
put
to
referendum
here
is
a
far
broader
class
of
things,
it’s
too
broad
and
not
the
kind
of
things
to
which
the
rationale
is
suppose
to
apply.
similarly,
not
everything
to
which
the
rationale
it
might
apply
is
to
put
the
referendum,
but
as
i
say
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
form
of
referendum
that
i
just
referred
to
suggest
the
answer
to
the
question
you
raised
yesterday
about
how
would
you
put
the
question
affirmatively
to
the
voters
because
it
does
described
in
sufficient
terms
the
kind
of
project
that
would
be
or
might
be
put
to
them
to
require
in
blocking
up
the
project.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
a
continuing
rule
requiring
that
appropriations
for
public
relief
be
submitted
to
referendum
when
nothing
else
is
submitted
to
referendum
would
be
discrimination
against
the
poor
and
the
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
if
the
people
wish
to
determine
their
policies
even
handedly
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
missed
the
last
few
words.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
say,
if
the
people
as
we
do
in
where
i
live
determine
our
policies
in
town
meeting
with
everyone
attending.
i
don’t
think
this
court
could
say
that
that
was
unconstitutional
because
we
make
all
our
appropriations
that
way.
mr.
archibald
cox
in
the
original
constitution?
mr.
archibald
cox
as
if
it
was
as
a
substantive
policy
or
are
other
words
statute
that
abolished
our
relief,
i
don’t
think
we
could
--
we
certainly
wouldn’t
make
the
argument
we
do
here.
that
would
be
a
substantive
decision.
it
would
not
be
a
discrimination
built
into
the
structure
of
government.
whether
there
are
other
arguments
i
don’t
know,
but
it
wouldn’t
be
the
argument
we
make
here.
mr.
archibald
cox
certainly
not
on
the
ground,
no,
not
in
the
ground
we
are
now.
if
i
said
anything
to
contrary
to
that,
i
--
that's
just
slip
of
the
tongue.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
missed
understood
and
your
answer
mr.
justice
brennan
is
quite
right.
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
trying
to
distinguish
perhaps
i
become
confused.
i'm
trying
to
distinguish
between
a
decision
of
substantive
policy,
there
shall
be
no
housing
or
there
shall
be
no
relief
what
seems
to
me
to
be
one
question.
and
a
decision
that
builds
a
disadvantage
into
the
way
substantive
policies
are
made
which
i
say
under
hunter
and
erickson
is
like
waiting
votes
or
denying
vote
to
a
particular
class.
and
i
think
this
is
of
the
utmost
importance
because
saying
to
a
class
of
people
that
they
don’t
--
are
treated
and
particularly
to
a
class
of
people
subject
to
invidious
discrimination
that
they
don’t
stand
like
other
people.
the
decisions
affecting
them
ought
to
be
made
by
the
same
processes
as
decisions’
affecting
other
people
is
particularly
offensive
to
our
system
--
constitutional
system
of
government.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
if
--
i
don’t
think
if
california
were
to
repeal
its
statute
providing
for
accepting
public
housing
under
the
united
states
housing
act.
i
think
we
would
have
an
all
together
different
case.
because
again,
it
would
not
be
a
discrimination
built
into
the
way
decisions
are
reach.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes
that’s
true,
but
of
course
in
other
places
when
it
comes
to
discrimination
in
voting
or
when
it
comes
to
malapportionment
or
other
things
of
that
kind,
we
don’t
say
that
the
consequences
might
end
up
the
same
way.
indeed,
to
take
a
silly
example
that
occurred
to
me
on
the
way
up
here,
we
don’t
say
when
a
man
complains
that
he’s
been
put
on
trial
without
counsel.
well,
you
might
do
a
whole
lot
better
than
a
lot
of
lawyers
i’ve
heard
in
court.
it’s
the
fact
of
the
discrimination,
the
additional
hurdle
or
obstacle
or
in
the
singling
really
for
an
oppressive
brand
to
which
offends
me
that
i
think
makes
the
difference.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
my
analogy
doesn’t
help
on
the
discrimination.
it
was
meant
to
go
on
later
the
point
that
the
way
it
meant
to
argue
that
it
might
end
up
the
same
way
isn’t
an
answer
to
an
unconstitutional
action
by
the
state.
that
was
all
i
meant
just
a
minute.
mr.
archibald
cox
that’s
quite
right,
they
do
and
their
cases
are
exactly
the
same
in
that
respect.
mr.
archibald
cox
precisely,
very,
very
similar
indeed.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
precise
question
in
these
cases
as
i
understand
it
is
whether
the
state
may
require
local
government
action
which
would
provide
public
housing
for
the
poor,
for
persons
of
low-income.
mr.
archibald
cox
under
the
standards
in
the
federal
statute
one
can
take
roughly
the
$4,000.00
level
of
income
as
eligible
for
low-income
housing.
there
are
our
standards
that
i
set
forth
in
the
statute.
the
questions
is
whether
the
state
or
rather
--
yes
the
state
may
require
local
government
action
providing
low-rent
housing
for
the
poor
to
run
the
gauntlet
of
an
automatic
referendum
not
required
in
the
case
of
governmental
action.
in
behalf
of
any
other
group
in
the
community
and
we
think
because
of
the
fact
that
this
is
housing
for
the
benefit
of
persons
of
low-income
and
article
xxxiv
is
limited
to
that
case
that
this
is
a
situation
where
a
one
combines
a
discrimination
in
the
processes
of
government
with
an
invidious
classification
which
distinguishes
a
great
many
other
cases.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
is
the
referendum.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
the
special
referendum
to
these
people
which
we
complain
of
as
the
unconstitutional
discrimination
in
this
case,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
the
action
normally
is
taken
by
the
county
or
by
the
city
and
there
can
be
no
low-rent
housing
without
at
least
two
favorable
votes
by
the
county
board
of
supervisors
or
the
city
council.
indeed,
that's
the
way
we
contend
that
it
should
be
done.
it’s
this
extra
obstacle.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh!
excuse
me.
mr.
archibald
cox
that’s
alright
mr.
justice.
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
not
--
i
now
understand
what
you
mean
by
stock
but
i
don’t
understand
the
question,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
we’re
not
complaining
in
anyway
of
local
option
down
the
list.
there's
no
complaint
about
this
being
a
matter
of
local
option.
this
indeed
is
the
matter
determined
by
local
self-government
and
even
if
article
xxxiv
that's
wipe
up
of
us.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
do
not
and
they
said
up
to
the
classification
invidious
terms.
in
terms
of
this
being
a
benefit
for
people
of
low-income.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
there
can
be
no
neutral
classification,
no
neutral
principle
that
would
call
for
a
referendum
in
certain
kinds
of
case.
the
bond
issue
case
seems
to
me
to
be
accord
--
to
conform
to
a
neutral
principle.
i
would
think
the
referendum
that's
called
for
in
one
or
two
cities
in
california
for
on
any
question
of
giving
away
park
lot.
probably,
it
rests
upon
a
neutral
principle
of
disfavoring
the
disposition
of
open
parks
and
property.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i'm
referring
of
course
the
opinion
of
justice
stewart
and
justice
harlan
in
hunter
and
erickson.
i
mean
one
that
is
non-invidious,
one
that
is
not
rest
upon
distinctions
against
disfavored
classes.
race
was
the
one
involved
there.
we
say
that
they
have
that
case
identical
with
this
case
except
that
here
it’s
persons
of
low-income.
mr.
archibald
cox
except
for
the
fact
that
in
the
first
instance
the
disfavored
class
here
is
the
poor
rather
than
in
terms
of
race.
i
do
think
there's
no
other
difference
justice
harlan.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
--
mr.
archibald
cox
much
of
it
often
welfare
money
of
course.
mr.
archibald
cox
much
of
it
often
welfare
money
of
the
$4,000.00
a
year.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it
might
be.
it
doesn’t
enable
if
you
read
the
affidavits
in
the
record
of
the
conditions
under
which
these
people
are
living.
i
suggest
that
they
are
indigents
in
the
most
realistic
sense
of
the
word.
i
point
out
too
that
the
court,
mr.
justice
harlan
has
referred
to
property
classifications,
classifications
of
wealth
in
kramer,
in
cipriano,
and
the
phoenix
case
and
others
as
classifications
that
are
suspect
and
at
some
cases
has
drawn
that
kind
of
line.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
--
the
relationship
is
just
the
same
as
in
hunter
and
erickson.
mr.
archibald
cox
then
we
would
be
making
the
same
argument.
or
as
you
suggested
earlier,
if
this
provided
that
there
must
be
votes
by
five
successive
boards
of
supervisors,
we
would
be
making
the
same
argument.
mr.
archibald
cox
then
i
could
not
make
the
argument
i'm
making
now
and
the
chief
justice
stated
that
very
precisely
earlier
(voice
overlap).
i’m
saying
there
could
be
no
argument.
i
could
not
make
the
argument
i'm
making
today.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
would
have
to
be
on
a
different
ground,
that's
correct.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
i
think
it
would
--
we
would
probably
take
it
to
the
supreme
court
of
california
and
we
would
rely
chiefly
on
an
opinion
that
i
should
refer
your
honor
is
to
in
the
san
francisco
unified
school
district
against
johnson
in
92
california
reporter
309.
i
refer
to
that
case,
it’s
not
--
it
doesn’t
deal
with
article
xxxiv
i
don’t
want
to
mislead
you,
but
it
does
indicate
that
the
supreme
court
of
california
might
well
invalidate
article
xxxiv
on
the
ground
that
if
permits
and
even
invites
people
to
vote
against
low-cost
housing
on
racial
grounds.
the
california
court
says
that
inviting
people
to
vote
in
referenda
or
to
take
action
generally
was
there
speaking
of
parents
refusing
to
allow
their
children
to
be
assigned
outside
a
neighborhood
school
district.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
because
--
no,
no,
it’s
simply
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law.
there's
no
question
of
california
constitutional
law
because
this
in
the
california
constitution.
there
was
no
question
of
california
constitutional
law
i
believe
in
that
case,
it
was
decided
on
the
federal
government.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
yes,
so
that's
one
ground
and
would
probably
be
the
primary
ground
of
attack
here.
let
me
elaborate;
add
a
little
more
length
the
matter
of
the
mandatory
referendum.
mr.
lasky
says
that
there
are
other
instances
of
mandatory
referendum
and
of
course
he's
right.
he
describes
one
as
that
disposition
of
public
property.
what
he
means
of
course
is
the
occasional
provision
in
a
city
charter
which
deal
with
the
disposition
a
part
property.
there's
certainly
nothing
in
common
between
that
case
and
this
one.
he
speaks
of
burdens
on
the
general
taxpayer,
the
only,
the
section
he
refers
to
is
the
provision
of
the
california
constitution
which
requires
a
referendum
when
an
issue
of
bonds
or
other
general
debt
chargeable
against
the
government
state
or
local
government
is
involved.
and
we
point
out
as
i
suggested
yesterday,
many
instances
where
land
is
taken
off
the
tax
rolls
and
there
maybe
some
increase
demand
for
municipal
services
which
does
not
require
a
referendum
in
california.
incidentally,
justice
harlan,
i
believe
that
that
case
involving
the
california
bond
issue
and
the
requirement
of
a
two-thirds
vote
is
presently
before
the
court
in
westbrook
and
mihaly.
i
don’t
know
whether
it’s
been
argued
yet
but
the
matter
is
here.
then
the
third
category
that
he
refers
to
is
changes
in
the
boundaries
or
constitution
of
local
government.
i
know
nothing
in
common
between
this
case
and
that.
this
case
has
the
characteristics
that
i
refer
to
before,
the
built-in
disadvantage,
the
invidious
classification,
and
the
inability
to
explain
it
by
any
neutral
principle.
mr.
archibald
cox
now,
i’d
like
--
mr.
archibald
cox
of
course.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
wish
to
know
what
social
welfare
legislation
meant
justice
harlan.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
don’t
like
to
evade
the
--
i
really
do
find
it
difficult
to
know
just
what
you
mean
by
social
welfare
legislation
because
of
our
unemployment
insurance
laws
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
then
i
hope
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
then
i
have
hunter
and
erickson.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
hunter
and
erickson
is
the
same
case
we
have
here,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
maybe
i
didn’t
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
did.
i
thought
he
said
fair
housing,
i'm
very
sorry.
if
it
said
that
all
low-rent
housing
and
said
nothing
more
of,
i
would
then
have
virtually
the
same
case
i
have
now
except
that
this
is
facial
discrimination
of
which
i
do
find
particularly
offensive
somehow
putting
a
brand
but
i
think
it
be
in
substance.
the
same
case
probably
that
difference
is
by
(inaudible)
rather
than
the
real
one.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
say,
i
think
i
would
give
the
answer
that
i
gave
before
mr.
chief
justice
that
singling
out
interest
of
the
poor
whether
they
are
defined
as
social
welfare
and
that's
all
that
one
means
and
saying
that
they
must
be
treated
differently
in
the
process
of
reaching
decisions
in
government.
apparently,
just
because
it
is
the
poor
or
those
who
need
the
protection
of
social
welfare
legislation
is
invidious.
now,
here
i
do
have
and
i
don’t
want
to
give
way
too
much.
here,
we
do
have
some
closer
comparisons
to
make.
let
me
devote
myself
for
a
few
minutes
to
the
argument.
well,
what
is
the
discrimination?
what
are
the
two
things
that
this
discrimination
between?
and
there
are
four
points
i
would
like
to
make
in
this
connection.
the
first
is
that
california
draws
a
much
nicer
line
that
much
of
the
appellant’s
argument
supposes.
under
urban
renewal
projects,
it
is
very
common
for
a
public
authority
to
acquire
a
site,
clear
it,
and
sell
it
at
less
than
cost
to
a
private
operator
who
constructs
a
multi-unit
housing
upon
the
track
such
as
high
rise
apartment
and
the
sale
less
than
cost
is
clearly
a
form
of
public
subsidy.
there
is
upper
income
housing
on
urban
renewal
sites
at
sta.
monica
shores;
bunker
hill
which
i
found
in
my
amazement
was
in
los
angeles
and
not
charleston,
massachusetts,
seaside,
diamond
heights,
glen
park
were
nominated
for
example.
now,
another
thing
that
is
done
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
it
maybe,
i
guess
it
is
subject
to
a
petition
referendum.
i
think
i'm
not
certain
of
that
but
i
know
it
is
not
subject
to
an
automatic
referendum.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
yes
and
again
of
course,
our
case
would
be
entirely
different.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
their
difference
is
--
mr.
archibald
cox
differences
are
three.
one
is
that
those
who
oppose
this
step
was
must
go
out
and
get
the
5%
or
8%
of
the
voters
and
have
the
burden
of
carrying.
a
second
difference
which
may
be
somewhat
formal,
but
which
i
think
as
psychological
significance
under
the
mandatory
referendum,
you
can't
do
anything
until
an
affirmative
vote
is
been
held,
whereas
the
petition
referendum
in
a
fact
shall
we
over
turn
what
our
local
authorities
have
gone.
and
then
the
third
point,
as
i
suggested
yesterday,
the
mandatory
referendum
under
article
xxxiv
works
only
one
way.
now,
there
are
other
kinds
of
housing
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
if
it
was
cut
down
to
that
small
number,
then
there
might
be
a
different
case,
but
i
suggest
that
5%
to
8%
is
not
a
mere
formality.
again,
of
course
i
cite
hunter
and
erickson
as
authority
for
that
proposition.
i
think
those
who
tried
to
get
5%
or
8%
of
the
voters
on
signature
would
agree
that
it
is
not
just
a
formality.
now,
i
can
go
a
little
further
on
the
matter
of
housing
not
only
is
the
matter
of
transferring
the
site
at
less
than
cost
under
urban
renewal.
but
there
are
occasions
when
the
construction
itself
is
subsidized
by
fha
conventions
which
reduced
the
interest
that
the
real
estate
development
has
to
pay
because
the
fha
pays
the
difference
between
what
he
can
pay
in
the
way
of
interest
from
the
rents
and
what
a
mortgagee
would
require.
and
sometimes
there
are
rent
supplements
paid
in
such
cases.
if
the
sponsor
is
a
non-profit
institution
and
there
are
projects
being
developed
this
way
then
the
interest
rate
is
lower.
and
often
there
is
--
what
in
fact
is
an
important
aid
and
that
the
federal
government
takes
the
mortgage
when
no
one
else
will.
now,
i'm
talking
about
vagueness
that
the
california
municipalities
are
involved
in
because
it’s
urban
renewal
land.
and
in
these
cases,
i
really
don’t
see
any
relevant
difference
between
the
middle-income
housing
project
and
the
low-rent
project
which
article
xxxiv
has
aimed.
both
are
housing,
both
have
at
least
some
attributes
government
projects,
both
are
publicly
subsidized
and
i've
not
yet
heard
anyone
suggest
why
the
difference
and
where
the
title
resides.
i
should
make
justify
a
difference
in
their
treatment
in
local
government.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
there
is
a
difference
but
i
point
out
again
the
very
large
number
of
instances
in
which
land
is
taken
off
the
tax
rolls
by
public
or
private
action.
and
california
doesn’t
require
automatic
referendum
then.
the
second
point
that
i
would
emphasize
simply
by
way
of
recalling
it
is
i
pointed
out
yesterday,
other
government
action
having
all
the
characteristics
of
low-rent
housing
except
the
involvement
of
the
poor
is
not
required
to
go
to
an
automatic
referendum
in
california.
in
other
words,
no
matter
what
comparison
you
make,
other
groups
aren’t
treated
the
same.
mr.
archibald
cox
highways
and
airports
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
but
not
just
federal
also
state
changes
it
--
yes?
mr.
archibald
cox
i
just
described
the
closest
(voice
overlap)
that
i
know.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
true.
but
then
i
think
there's
a
further
point
justice
stewart.
i
think
the
appellant’s
argument
and
our
inability
to
point
to
some
exact
comparison
where
the
only
difference
is
the
involvement
of
the
poor
that
that
difficulty
has
got
over
by
hunter
and
erickson.
rarely,
the
claim
that
we
can't
show
that
discrimination
against
the
poor
results
from
the
article
xxxiv
because
we
can't
show
any
high
income
housing
owned
by
the
government
just
like
this
is
sort
of
a
pale
copy
of
the
argument
that
the
akron
charter
amendment
was
nondiscriminatory
because
whites
as
well
as
blacks,
protestants
as
well
as
catholics
who
were
seeking
fair
housing
legislation
had
to
go
to
a
referendum.
here
is
that
the
reality
is
that
the
law’s
impact
falls
under
minority.
mr.
archibald
cox
then
if
a
public
housing
--
we
wouldn’t
because
if
a
public
housing
project
within
the
zoning
line
could
be
built
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
don’t
--
i
would
submit
that
it
wasn’t
as
invidious.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
property
development
and
zoning
laws
affecting
property
development
are
too
much
less
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
wouldn’t
say
that
there
could
never
be
any
classification
based
on
non-property
owning.
i
want
to
know
in
what
context
it
did
arose
and
also
what
subject
it
related
to.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
in
this
context
[laughter
attempt]
i
think
that
it’s
a
discriminatory
classification.
mr.
archibald
cox
all
changes
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
think
that
one
could
be
sustained
and
the
other
should
be
rejected,
yes.
because
i
think
the
zoning
laws
is
a
sufficiently
broad
in
general
subject
that
it
does
not
single
out
people
who
are
subject
to
prejudice
in
order
to
discriminate
against
them
in
seeking
their
needs.
may
i
develop
that
part
people
who
are
subject
prejudice
just
a
little
bit
further?
this
of
course
is
a
law
which
raises
a
--
puts
under
a
legal
disadvantage
persons
who
are
in
the
low-income
group.
it’s
not
an
argument
here
that
the
law
works
harder
on
those
who
have
that
money
than
on
those
who
have
it
when
the
law
is
written
in
a
nondiscriminatory
fashion
in
its
terms.
second,
it
seems
to
me
that
when
speaking
of
the
political
process
or
the
structure
of
government
it
is
proper
to
characterize
the
poor
as
an
insular
and
discreet
minority.
that
phrase
has
been
used
in
constitutional
law.
next,
i
would
emphasize
that
discrimination
against
the
poor
is
in
very
large
degree
--
a
form
of
racial
or
religious
discrimination.
it’s
in
fact,
all
over
the
country
minorities
form
a
disproportionate
part
of
the
poor.
the
douglas
report
stated
that
it
is
of
1967,
41%
of
the
poor
using
the
$4,000.00
limit
to
describe
the
poor;
41%
of
the
nonwhite
were
poor
and
only
12%
of
the
white.
if
you
look
at
the
population
as
a
whole,
32%
are
poor
nonwhite
--
no,
32%
of
the
nonwhite
are
poor
and
only
12%
of
the
general
population
is
nonwhite.
in
sta.
clara,
one
find
is
looking
not
at
the
black
population
but
at
the
mexican-americans
that
15.2%
of
all
households
have
incomes
below
$4,000.00
but
26.8%
of
the
mexican-americans
have
income
below
$4,000.00.
and
as
the
opinion
below
points
out,
i
won't
stop
to
read
it
in
the
footnote.
it’s
the
minorities
who
have
the
intense
need
for
housing.
indeed,
the
president’s
commission
on
housing
pointed
out
that
the
need
for
housing
among
minority
was
three
times
as
intense.
minorities
of
course
form
the
great
black
of
people
who
are
the
occupants
of
low-rent
public
housing
and
when
people
vote
on
these
questions
as
the
affidavits
in
the
record
make
clear.
there
is
not
much
doubt
on
that
what
is
on
the
agenda
is
the
unwise
poor
--
the
minorities
whose
housing
is
more
notably
inadequate
than
everyone
else
is.
there
are
two
other
consequences
which
i
can't
say
are
written
into
the
statute
and
which
i
don’t
make
our
case
turn
exclusively
on
but
other
point
but
i
think
there’re
important
consequences
in
deciding
whether
this
is
an
invidious
classification.
they
go
very
closely
together.
the
great
problem
in
housing
and
the
great
problems
that
result
from
it
come
from
the
difficulties
that
persons
of
low-income
have
in
moving
to
communities
where
the
better
jobs
are,
where
there
is
opportunity
for
self-help
and
advancement.
and
i
suppose
there
are
two
no
better
are
examples
anywhere
in
the
country
than
san
mateo
county
as
one
goes
down
on
the
peninsula
in
california
and
san
jose
down
at
the
end
of
the
bank.
and
the
problem
is
that
there
is
no
housing
for
people
to
move
into
those
areas
so
that
here
there
is
an
indirect
restraint,
i
don’t
liken
it
to
shapiro
and
thompson.
there
is
an
indirect
restraint
on
freedom
of
movement
to
go
and
help
themselves
and
there
is
also
of
course
a
resulting,
built-in
house
preservation
of
the
ghettos.
because
this
kind
of
obstacle
makes
it
difficult
to
build
the
necessary
public
housing
units
in
counties
like
sta.
clara
and
san
mateo
and
that
too
results
in
racial
discrimination.
it
seems
to
me
as
i
say
in
deciding
whether
this
is
an
invidious
classification,
a
distinction
against
the
persons
of
low-income
who
can't
afford
this
housing
that
these
consequences
are
properly
taken
into
account.
but
the
heart
of
my
case
rests
on
the
combination
as
i
have
said
too
many
times,
i'm
afraid,
of
the
built-in
disadvantage
not
required
on
any
other
kind
of
interest
of
any
other
group.
the
expressed
classification
of
persons
of
low-income
and
the
other
absence
of
any
neutral
principle
which
california
can
be
said
to
have
followed
in
setting
up
the
classes
of
those
required
to
go
to
an
automatic
referendum.
taking
those
together
mr.
chief
justice,
we
submit
that
there
is
a
denial
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
law.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
--
because
the
students
couldn’t
vote.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
guess
you
took
care
of
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
that
the
character
of
the
bond
issue
provision
is
one
which
is
a
general
one
relating
to
all
bond
issues
is
one
that
cuts
against
one
group
today
and
another
group
tomorrow.
and
therefore,
one
can
say
that
this
category
was
set
up
according
to
a
uniform
rule
that
doesn’t
point
the
finger
at
any
group
in
the
community
that
says
where
we’re
incurring
long
term
debt,
the
kind
of
thing
of
course
which
in
the
history
if
the
country
frequently
resulted
in
insolvency
of
cities
and
counties.
when
we’re
talking
about
long-term
debt,
we
want
to
go
more
slowly.
so
we
will
set
up
a
separate
governmental
manner
of
dealing
with
that
group
provisions.
that
doesn’t
seem
to
me
to
involve
any
invidious
classification.
you
do
have
the
question
here
whether
two-thirds
can
be
required.
the
supreme
court
of
california
held
that
two-thirds
could
not
constitutionally
be
required,
of
course
we’re
not.
i
just
recalling
that
for
the
court’s
benefit
we’re
not
involved
in
that
and
i'm
certainly
not
arguing
the
merits
to
that
question.
