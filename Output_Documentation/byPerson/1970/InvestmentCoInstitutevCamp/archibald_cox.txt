mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
justice
black
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
was
remarked
earlier,
this
is
one
of
two
related
cases.
but
i
think
there
is
one
respect
in
which
they
were
not
quite
correctly
described.
it
is
true
as
i
understand
it
that
if
the
case
to
be
argued
tomorrow,
the
ici
case
should
be
reversed,
then
this
case
seizes
to
be
important.
but
on
the
other
hand
justice
stewart,
even
if
the
exemption
should
be
held
improper
which
of
course
we
denied,
then
the
ici
case
still
would
be
important.
first,
because
regulation
9
is
an
issue
in
the
ici
case
and
because
there
is
some
reason
to
believe
that
it
would
be
possible
to
operate
managing
agency
commingled
investment
accounts.
even
so,
there
were
no
exemptions
from
section
10(c).
that’s
a
moot
point.
i
don’t
mean
to
say
the
exemption
isn’t
important
but
it
isn't
quite
accurate
to
say
that
if
it
were
denied,
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
managing
agency
commingled
investment
account,
speaking
of
them
as
a
category
not
of
this
particular
plan.
mr.
archibald
cox
two
things
are
possible
as
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
explained
in
the
amicus
brief
by
the
fiduciary
associations
of
chicago.
one
is
it
is
possible
that
it
might
be
held
that
the
entire
commingling
authorized
by
a
regulation
9
is
not
under
the
investment
company
act.
mr.
archibald
cox
second,
it
is
possible
that
the
federal
reserve
board
which
has
given
its
approval
to
these
plans
and
found
them
in
the
public
interest
might
find
it
sufficient
that
the
bank
had
the
contract
to
act
as
investment
advisor
and
two
bank
officers
on
the
board
of
directors.
we
couldn’t
be
sure
of
that,
that’s
why
we
asked
permission
to
have
three
so
that
it
really
would
be
wholly
within
the
bank.
but
if
it
had
to
go
the
other
way
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don’t
think
the
whole
thing
could
fairly
be
said
to
be
debt.
mr.
archibald
cox
certainly
not
clearly
vice-versa.
there
are
two
general
observations
which
i
think
are
pertinent
to
both
cases.
in
the
first
place,
it’s
important
not
to
slip
into
such
question
begging
characterizations
as
mutual
fund,
investment
company,
securities
business
are
on
our
side,
fiduciary
relation.
the
real
question
here
is
which
is
the
right
characterization?
and
of
course,
the
right
characterization
depends
upon
examination
of
what
it
is
that
the
bank
is
actually
doing.
second,
the
right
characterization
has
been
decided
in
these
cases
by
the
expert
agencies
unanimously,
in
favor
of
the
view
that
what
the
bank
is
doing
is
performing
a
traditional
fiduciary
banking
function.
in
a
way,
that
preserves
the
fiduciary
relationship
and
which
is
in
the
public
interests.
this
is
a
view
supported
not
only
by
the
comptroller
but
by
the
federal
reserve
board
both
in
its
ruling
given
to
city
bank
and
in
its
testimony
before
congress
by
the
federal
deposit
insurance
company,
by
the
new
york
banking
authorities
in
parallel
situations
and
to
the
extent
that
it
was
pertinent
under
the
investment
company
act
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
and
so
here,
the
question
i
think
is
not
as
mr.
levin’s
argument
suggests
whether
the
commission
could
properly
exempt
an
ordinary
investment
company
from
section
10(c).
but
rather,
it’s
whether
the
commission
made
a
permissible
expert
judgment,
when
it
concluded
that
this
is
not
the
kind
of
investment
company
with
which
the
purpose
of
section
10(c)
was
primarily
concerned.
but
as
i
say,
a
fiduciary
banking
activity
which
could
be
exempted
without
departing
from
the
purposes
or
policy
of
the
act
and
which
should
be
exempted
in
the
public
interest
that
the
commission
was
correct
in
that
finding.
but
it
becomes
apparent
when
one
goes
behind
the
labels
and
looks
at
the
development
of
the
commingled
investment
account.
and
to
do
that,
it’s
really
necessary
to
go
back
to
1913
when
section
11(k)
of
the
federal
reserve
act
gave
the
federal
reserve
board
a
power
to
issue
to
national
banks,
permits
to
act
in
sundry
fiduciary
capacities.
the
present
language
of
then
modifications
is
set
forth
at
page
1(a)
of
our
brief
and
it
describes
these
powers
as
the
right
to
act
as
trustee,
executer,
administrator
and
so
forth
or
over
on
the
next
page,
in
any
other
fiduciary
capacity
in
which
state
banks
can
act.
and
there's
no
doubt
that
state
banks
could
act
in
this
capacity
under
the
law
of
new
york.
under
this
section,
banks
have
of
course
long
activities,
trustees,
executives,
guardians
and
so
forth.
they’ve
also
acted
as
agents
to
keep
custody
in
a
customer’s
assets,
securities
and
to
give
him
advice
concerning
investments
with
the
customer
retaining
the
final
decision
whether
to
change
his
securities.
in
addition,
banks
have
frequently
acted
as
managing
agents
in
the
strict
sense.
that
is
to
say
the
customer
turns
over
his
assets
to
them
and
the
bank
makes
and
executes
all
investment
decisions
concerning
the
management
of
the
customer’s
assets
where
they
drew
fiduciary
relationship
between
the
principal
and
the
agent.
and
i
would
emphasize
that
this
was
only
one
of
many
fiduciary
activities.
all
of
which
belong
in
a
single
bundle.
now
at
first
--
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
i
pointed
out
that
since
the
federal
reserve
act
of
1913,
managing
other
people’s
money’s
in
various
fiduciary
capacities
has
been
a
traditional
banking
function.
and
that
the
individual
managing
agency
account
has
been
one
way
of
performing
that
function
along
with
testamentary
trust,
inter
vivos
trust,
executorships
and
the
like
and
other
forms
of
agency.
in
the
beginning,
the
federal
reserve
board
followed
the
common
law
and
forbade
national
banks
to
commingle
the
assets
of
different
beneficiaries
or
different
principles.
about
1920,
it
began
relax
that
rule.
and
in
1937,
there
came
a
major
relaxation
that
permitted
the
commingling
of
the
101
of
different
trust
executorships
and
guardianships
and
the
like.
and
under
that
new
regulation,
the
now
familiar
common
trust
fund
grew
and
flourished.
partly,
i
think
because
the
economies
of
commingling
which
reduced
the
management
cost
and
partly
because
of
the
advantages
of
diversification.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
statute
goes
back
to
1913.
the
commingling
was
not
authorized
until
about
1920
then
on
a
very
small
scale.
and
then
commingling
on
the
scale
that
we’re
all
familiar
with
for
the
common
trust
fund
came
in
1937.
but
in
1937,
the
rule
was
not
relaxed
so
far
as
individual
managing
agency
accounts
are
concerned.
it
was
relaxed
for
all
other
fiduciary
capacity.
mr.
archibald
cox
executorships,
guardianships
and
the
like.
mr.
archibald
cox
managed
by
the
banks
of
course.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
the
effect
of
regulation
9
which
is
an
issue
in
the
next
case
is
to
extend
to
managing
agencies,
the
same
privilege
to
commingle
that
it
proved
to
be
successful
and
so
free
from
abuse
in
the
case
of
trust
and
that
kind
of
fiduciary
capacity.
indeed,
if
you
will
look
--
when
you
come
to
look
at
regulation
9,
you
would
see
that
it
treats
commingling
strict
trust
funds
and
managing
agency
funds
in
exactly
parallel
capacity.
the
reasons
for
this
were
very
well
stated
somewhat
later
by
the
federal
reserve
board
in
a
letter
to
the
congress
speaking
of
the
public
interest
in
having
banks
continue
to
offer
this
kind
of
managing
agency
commingled
investment
account
and
a
letter
quoted
in
the
back
of
our
brief
on
page
35
(a).
we
had
pointed
out
that
there
were
three
advantages.
first,
this
was
a
means
of
performing
a
traditional
banking
function
more
efficiently
and
at
less
cost.
second,
that
it
provided
competition
for
the
mutual
funds
which
of
course
in
these
cases
are
seeking
to
preserve
a
monopolistic
or
quasi-monopolistic
position
free
from
competition.
and
third,
that
in
special
cases,
it
enabled
a
combination
of
investment
and
other
special
fiduciary
services.
during
the
time
that
regulation
9
was
under
consideration,
the
securities
in
exchange
commission
took
the
position
that
any
commingled
fund
of
managing
agency
accounts
would
be
subject
to
the
investment
company
act.
it
said
that
the
interest
in
the
fund
would
be
securities,
that
the
fund
or
the
bank
would
be
an
issuer
or
underwriter
and
that
consequently,
there
had
to
be
registration
under
the
investment
company
act.
i
would
point
out
in
this
connection
however
and
indeed
emphasize
that
while
the
sec
and
chairman
cary
and
chairman
cohen
stood
very
stoutly
on
the
position
that
there
must
be
conformity
with
the
investment
company
act.
they
never
took
the
view
that
the
managing
agency
commingled
investment
account.
it
was
unlawful
or
in
anyway
against
the
public
interest.
indeed
from
the
very
beginning,
chairman
cary
later
chairman
cohen
and
the
staff
all
indicated
that
they
would
look
favorably
at
exempting
a
managing
agency
commingled
investment
account.
for
many
of
the
provisions
of
the
investment
company
act
that
might
be
a
bar
to
performing
the
function
authorized
by
the
comptroller
under
regulation
9
and
later
approved
by
the
federal
reserve
board.
mr.
archibald
cox
not
at
all,
no.
and
the
1940
act
would
not
be
applicable
to
the
type
of
common
trust
fund
involving
an
inter-vivo
or
testamentary
trust
because
it
is
expressly
exempted.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
that’s
correct.
it
was
the
pooling
that
the
sec
said
brought
it
under
the
investment
company
act.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
not
justice
white.
i
think
their
position
was
that
even
if
there
were
no
piece
of
paper,
it
would
be
the
interest,
the
undivided
interest
would
nevertheless
be
regarded
as
something
that
brought
them
under
the
investment
company
act.
that’s
my
understanding
of
the
testimony.
of
course
as
we
do
it
there
are
those
certificates.
mr.
archibald
cox
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
--
we
say
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
out
our
fiduciary
responsibilities
and
for
no
other
purpose.
it
was
a
controversy
between
the
comptroller
and
the
commission
which
led
to
congressional
hearings.
during
that
controversy,
city
bank
developed
the
plan
in
which
it
was
believed
would
comply
both
with
the
requirements
of
the
banking
laws
and
be
satisfactory
to
the
sec
under
the
investment
company
act.
and
what
it
contemplated
was
this.
city
bank
would
continue
to
receive
assets
in
their
fiduciary
capacity
under
the
relation
of
managing
agent
and
principle
with
all
the
fiduciary
duties.
and
it
was
discretion
to
invest
those
through
a
common
fund.
to
the
extent
necessary
to
comply
with
the
investment
company
act,
the
common
fund
or
account
as
it
came
to
be
called,
was
given
a
separate
structure.
the
principles,
the
customer
investors
were
given
certificates
of
participation
which
were
nonassignable
and
nontransferable
which
would
terminate
upon
their
death.
the
certificate
holders
were
given
the
right
to
choose
as
they
wished
a
committee
made
up
of
five
individuals
as
it
developed,
two
of
whom
were
not
required
to
be
connected
with
the
bank.
and
the
committee
or
the
participants
were
given
power
to
terminate
the
bank’s
investment
adviser
contract
and
anytime
at
the
end
of
the
year.
that
subject
however
to
the
possibility
of
that
is
very
small.
the
bank
has
a
custody
of
all
the
assets,
manages,
tends
to
them
in
every
way,
chooses
what
investments
to
make
and
to
change
and
so
forth.
so,
in
the
ordinary
day-to-day
operation,
the
whole
thing
is
carried
out
by
the
bank
subject
only
to
this
possibility
of
the
certificate
holders
exercising
common
control
to
kick
the
bank
out.
there
are
a
few
other
minor
departures.
they’re
outlined
in
our
brief
in
footnote
12.
none
of
them,
i
think
affect
the
theory
or
the
fiduciary
relation.
certainly
none
affect
the
individual
fiduciary
relation
between
the
bank
and
the
customer
investor’s
principles.
and
the
bank
continues
to
be
required
to
conform.
in
all
respects
except
i’ve
mentioned
and
the
other
details
to
the
provisions
of
regulation
that.
now,
from
the
standpoint
of
the
banking
laws,
it
seemed
important
that
all
these
activities
be
conducted
as
the
federal
reserve
board
later
put
it
as
an
arm
or
department
of
the
bank
as
one
of
many
functions
within
the
trust
department
of
the
bank.
and
while
the
managing
--
while
the
investment
advisers
contract
alone
might
be
enough
to
do
that.
it
seemed
advisable
to
the
bank
and
its
lawyers
that
a
majority
of
the
board
of
directors
should
also
be
officers
of
the
bank.
and
it
was
that
that
led
to
the
application
for
an
exemption
from
section
10(c)
which
provides
that
a
bank
may
not
have
a
majority
of
the
board
of
directors
of
an
investment
company.
when
the
matter
came
before
the
sec,
it
made
three
critical
findings.
the
first
on
page
60,
points
out
that
this
account
which
is
technically
an
investment
company.
mr.
archibald
cox
page
60
of
the
appendix.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
it
pointed
out
that
this
was
not
the
kind
of
investment
company
and
at
with
section
10(c)
appeared
to
be
(a).
although
section
10(c)
is
general
in
terms,
it
does
not
appear
that
it
was
directed
at
the
type
of
open-ended
investment
company
represented
by
the
account
and
then
skipping
a
few
sentences.
it
is
clear
that
the
account
is
substantially
different
both
in
purpose
and
nature
of
operation
from
the
bank
dominated
investment
companies
which
led
to
passage
of
the
act.
the
second
finding
is
over
on
page
62.
in
our
opinion
in
the
commission
sent,
the
bank
you
shown
that
substantial
safeguards
are
present
here
against
conflicts
of
interest
which
could
arise
as
a
result
of
the
bank’s
commercial
banking
activities.
and
the
third
finding
which
is
in
flaccid
is
that
the
exemption
to
permit
these
activities
to
go
forward
would
be
in
the
public
interest.
we
submit
first
in
our
legal
argument
that
if
these
findings
are
reasonable,
these
conclusions
are
reasonable.
then,
the
commissions
order
is
plainly
valid.
section
6(c)
of
the
statute
which
is
on
the
back
of
our
brief
on
page
7(a)
plainly
gives
the
commission
the
power
to
exempt
any
person
conditionally
or
unconditionally
from
any
provision
or
provisions
of
this
title.
surely
the
words
in
a
provision
or
provision
to
this
title
are
broad
enough
to
encompass
the
provisions
of
section
10(c).
and
the
fact
that
literally
the
bank,
the
account
that
falls
within
section
10(c),
does
not
defeat
the
power
to
exempt
because
of
course
the
very
purpose
of
the
power
to
exempt
is
to
take
care
of
cases
which
literally
fall
within
the
language
of
the
statute.
furthermore,
that
has
been
the
consistent
interpretation
of
section
10(c)
for
28
years.
it
was
explained
to
congress
when
section
10(c)
was
pending
before
it
in
1940.
that
the
aim
was
to
take
care
of
cases
which
had
not
been
foreseen
by
the
drafts
which
might
fall
within
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
but
in
the
judgment
of
the
commission
not
really
within
its
policy
or
spirit.
at
the
time,
section
10(c)
was
before
congress,
there
was
no
commingling
of
managing
agency
accounts.
common
trust
funds,
the
nearest
analog
were
exempted
from
the
investment
company
act.
and
consequently
i
suggest
that
if
the
commission’s
findings
are
reasonable
then
this
is
a
classic
case
for
an
exemption.
the
commission’s
finding
that
the
proposed
relationship
between
city
bank
and
the
account
is
not
the
kind
addressed
by
section
10(c).
it
seems
to
me
to
be
supported
by
five
considerations.
first,
the
type
of
investment
company
with
which
congress
was
concerned
in
1940
when
it
was
debating
section
10(c).
was
a
close-end
investment
company,
a
fixed
pool
of
securities
which
bank
insiders
were
selling
very
largely
in
the
hope
of
making
their
own
profit,
a
company
in
which
they
certainly
had
an
interest.
this
account
of
course,
is
wholly
the
property
of
the
customers,
the
principles.
it’s
run
solely
for
their
benefit
and
the
bank
gets
nothing
more
from
it
than
the
usual
fee
that
it
gets
for
any
fiduciary
service
of
the
subject
to
the
comptroller
of
the
currency.
second,
those
investment
companies
for
the
most
part
purported
to
be
independent
concerns
with
as
--
when
the
customer
but
it’s
not
the
customer,
when
the
investor
bought
a
share,
he
thought
he
was
buying
a
share
in
the
investment
company.
and
if
the
bank
through
its
control
over
the
directors
dominated
it,
he
wasn’t
getting
something
free
from
the
influence
of
the
bank.
here
of
course
when
he
goes
to
the
bank
and
opens
his
managing
agency
account.
what
he
is
looking
for
is
the
bank
services.
and
what
he
gets
subject
to
this
power
of
ultimate
control
is
the
bank
services
throughout
the
entire
enterprise.
third,
i
would
emphasize
that
there
is
in
this
instance
but
not
in
the
kind
of
investment
company
at
which
section
10(c)
is
concerned,
a
direct
fiduciary
relation
between
the
bank
and
the
individual
customer
investment.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it
would
be
the
common
law,
i
presume
of
new
york
and
that
would
be
backed
up
by
the
regulations
of
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
in
regulation
9
which
spell
out
many
of
the
duties
and
of
course
the
comptroller
annually
inspects
the
fund
as
he
does
in
other
banking
activities
also
and
not
always
quite
that
often.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
no.
they’re
rigidly
forbidden
by
regulation
9
and
also
by
the
investment
company
act
to
have
any
dealings
with
the
account.
mr.
archibald
cox
both
reg.
9.
mr.
archibald
cox
any
investments
must
be
outside.
they
may
make
no
loans
to
the
account.
they
may
have
no
interest
in
the
securities
that
the
account
acquires.
indeed,
regulation
9
even
would
restrict
the
bank
from
buying
securities
of
companies
to
which
it
has
made
a
shaky
loan,
of
where
that
would
be
a
breach
of
trust
and
the
controller’s
representatives
have
instructed
to
be
on
the
lookout
for
such
things
in
the
instruction
we’ve
putted
on
our
brief.
i
would
emphasize
that
this
direct
fiduciary
relationship
was
noted
by
the
district
court
in
the
ici
case.
it
spelled
out
in
the
hoga
affidavit,
the
executive
vice
president
of
the
bank
in
the
ici
case.
it
was
also
noted
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
sec.
a
fourth
difference
between
the
investment
company
at
which
section
10(c)
was
directed
and
the
account
is
of
course
that
the
securities
affiliates
and
the
associated
investment
companies
at
which
section
10(c)
was
directed
were
set
out
for
the
purpose
of
evading
the
banking
laws
and
getting
out
from
under
scrutiny
of
the
controller.
i
perhaps
shouldn’t
say
vague
but
avoid,
i
don’t
meant
there
was
any
deceit
about
it
whereas
all
these
activities
are
carried
on
as
i
said
a
moment
ago
constantly
under
the
control
of
the
controller.
the
result
is
from
those
four
differences
that
none
of
the
evils
which
were
pointed
to
during
the
investigation
and
the
bank
securities
affiliates
and
bank
dominated
investment
companies
are
possible
the
presence
setup.
indeed,
not
even
the
petitioners
argue
that
they
are.
mr.
lewin(ph)
argues
that
the
sec
findings
are
immaterial
because
section
10(c)
imposes
a
rigid
barrier
to
the
banks
ever
having
a
majority
on
the
board
of
directors
where
there
is
any
possible
conflict
of
interest.
even
so
it’s
found
that
this
is
not
the
kind
of
thing
that
10(c)
was
directed
at,
even
so
the
commission
finds
that
there
are
adequate
safeguards
and
even
so
the
commission
finds
that
the
existence
of
the
account
is
in
the
public
interest.
i
submit
that
that
argument
is
unsupportable
for
four
reasons.
first,
it’s
certainly
contrary
to
the
plain
words
of
section
6(c)
which
give
power
to
exempt
without
restriction
except
for
the
necessary
findings.
second,
and
very
important,
the
characteristics
of
the
account
or
the
relationship
between
the
bank
and
the
account
that
are
said
to
give
rise
to
the
danger
of
abuse
here
are
characteristics
that
are
attendant
upon
all
fiduciary
banking
functions
and
we
know
that
congress
didn’t
find
them
so
dangerous
as
to
prohibit
this
kind
of
relationship
because
it
authorized
such
fiduciary
banking
functions
in
section
11(k)
of
the
federal
reserve
act
now
title
12
section
92(a).
it
would
certainly
be
incongruous
if
congress
somehow
had
singled
out
this
one
special
form
of
activity
which
is
just
like
the
others,
so
far
as
any
of
these
problems
are
concerned,
and
forbidden
it,
especially
since
in
this
case,
but
has
not
only
the
usual
safeguards
of
the
fiduciary
relationship
in
the
controller
supervision
but
one
has
the
additional
safeguards
of
the
investment
company
act.
we’ve
outlined
in
our
brief,
a
number
of
indications
as
the
commission
did
in
its
opinion
that
the
board
was
--
that
the
congress
was
not
seeking
such
a
rigid
separation
between
banks
and
investment
companies
as
mr.
levin
argues.
there’s
a
grandfather
clause
in
section
10(c).
banks
are
allowed
to
act
as
investment
advisers
which
from
a
day-to-day
point
of
view
is
the
really
controlling
manager
of
the
investing
company
and
of
course,
we
lay
great
stress
on
this.
the
one
form
of
commingling
that
was
none
at
the
time
the
investment
company
act
was
adopted,
the
common
trust
fund
was
exempted
from
the
investment
company
act.
an
important
analog
even
though
the
commission
said
we
couldn’t
bring
ourselves
within
it.
the
remaining
question
is
whether
there
was
adequate
support
for
the
sec
findings
that
there
were
adequate
safeguards
against
abuse
of
the
banks
control
over
the
fund
to
the
detriment
of
investors.
the
commission
took
up
point
by
point
all
the
abuses
which
it
was
said
might
result
and
found
that
they
were
not
sufficiently
serious
and
that
they
were
adequate
safeguards
against
them.
judge
bazelon
took
them
up
point
by
point
as
the
same
arguments
were
made
to
the
controller
and
he
rejected
them.
the
federal
reserve
board
scrutinized
most
of
them
in
the
letter
that
is
set
forth
at
the
end
of
our
brief.
and
it
concluded
too
that
there
were
adequate
safeguards
and
that
the
existence
of
such
funds
would
be
in
the
public
interest.
consequently,
we
submit
that
the
commission’s
findings
are
reasonably
based
in
the
record
and
that
its
judgment
ended
its
order,
should
therefore
be
affirmed
and
the
order
--
and
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
affirm.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
justice
black
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case
as
in
the
one
before
it,
we
start
with
the
unanimous
conclusion
of
all
the
expert
regulatory
agencies
that
what
the
bank
is
doing
is
carrying
on
a
somewhat
new
form
of
a
traditional
banking
function
which
is
not
prohibited
by
existing
law
and
which
is
in
the
public
interest
because
it
provides
a
traditional
kind
of
service
at
lower
cost
and
supplies
competition
for
what
would
otherwise
be
the
monopolistic
position
of
the
mutual
funds.
so
that
here
again,
the
general
question
involved
is
whether
petitioners
who
carried
the
very
heavy
burden
of
showing
that
the
agencies
conclusions
are
so
unreasonable
or
ill-considered,
that
they
must
be
set
aside
as
beyond
their
authority
or
otherwise
contrary
to
law
and
that
question
i
think
breaks
into
two
parts.
the
first
part
as
was
suggested
shortly
before
the
recess
is
whether
what
the
bank
is
doing
in
this
instance
is
a
lawful
banking
business
or
whether
to
put
it
in
more
exact
terms,
whether
the
bank
which
admittedly
acts
in
a
fiduciary
capacity
when
it
invests
the
funds
of
an
individual
principal
under
a
managing
agent
and
which
admittedly
acts
in
the
fiduciary
capacity
under
section
92
(a)
when
it
commingles
the
funds
of
several
beneficiaries
in
the
common
trust
fund,
somehow
ceases
to
act
in
any
fiduciary
capacity
in
the
language
of
the
statute,
when
it
commingles
the
funds
of
several
principals
into
one
account
which
the
bank
still
continues
to
manage
in
a
fiduciary
capacity
into
non-statutory
sense.
now
certainly,
the
mere
commingling
does
not
as
a
matter
of
law
destroy
the
fiduciary
capacity,
but
that
is
clear
on
any
number
of
cases.
it‘s
true
as
a
matter
of
right
of
observations
of
trust
laws
from
the
precedents.
and
second,
i
think
it
is
equally
plain
that
the
mere
registration
of
the
fund
under
the
investment
company
act
does
not
mean
that
the
bank
ceases
to
act
in
a
fiduciary
capacity.
nothing
divides
the
world
into
two
parts;
one,
the
monopoly
of
the
mutual
funds
and
the
other
a
proper
banking
function.
indeed,
the
mutual
funds
are
currently
engaged
in
buying
up
corporate
fiduciaries,
doing
the
very
sort
of
thing
that
banks
do
under
12
u.s.c.
section
92
(a)
and
surely,
nothing
requires
the
ironic
conclusion
that
something
that
you’re
properly
doing
under
section
92
(a)
suddenly
becomes
improper
if
you
go
and
provide
the
additional
protections
that
the
sec
requests
under
the
investment
company
act.
so
at
the
point
--
this
first
question
i
think
comes
down
to
whether
the
increased
number
of
customers
or
principals,
the
used
of
a
somewhat
standardized
form
of
managing
agency
agreement
and
the
pooled
investment
means
that
the
relationship,
well
perhaps
fiduciary
as
a
matter
of
law,
of
legal
concept,
ceases
to
be
a
fiduciary
relation
in
fact
or
in
function
or
whether
to
put
it
in
the
language
of
section
92
(a)
(k),
the
bank
is
abusing
its
fiduciary
power.
i
would
point
out
in
that
connection
that
section
92
(a)
(k)
expressly
gives
us
the
comptroller,
not
with
the
difference
of
this
court,
the
task
of
determining
and
issuing
regulations,
determining
what
restrictions
are
necessary
to
prevent
abuse
of
the
fiduciary
power.
we
think
that
conclusions
of
the
comptroller
that
this
remains
a
fiduciary
function
and
the
observation
of
chairman
martin
of
the
federal
reserve
board
in
writing
to
congress
that
it’s
a
traditional
fiduciary
function
are
borne
out
by
five
considerations.
in
the
first
place,
i
emphasize
again
the
individual
fiduciary
relationship
which
is
created
between
the
bank
and
each
customer
as
explained
in
the
hoe
gay
affidavit
which
is
the
only
evidence
on
the
point
in
the
record
which
is
created
between
them.
second,
the
fiduciary
duties
in
regulation
9
and
in
the
common
law
and
in
new
york
statutory
law
continue
to
characterize
this
relationship.
the
bank
is
not
permitted
to
have
any
interest
in
the
account.
it’s
not
permitted
to
deal
with
the
account.
it’s
required
to
segregate
the
property
of
the
account
from
its
own
property.
i
may
say
in
this
connection
that
the
new
york
statute
very
clearly
prohibits
a
bank
from
selling
assets
to
a
trust
or
to
this
agency
prohibits
--
mr.
archibald
cox
in
addition
to
that,
the
comptroller
interprets
section,
on
page
25a,
section
9,
18
(b)
(8(
(i)
about
the
middle
of
25a
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
of
my
brief,
excuse
me,
mr.
justice,
interprets
that
provision
as
forbidding
any
such
transactions,
whether
loan
or
sale
in
terms
of
a
collective
fund
and
he
will
not
recognize
any
exculpatory
clause
put
in
a
common
trust
fund.
this
is
the
matter
of
regular
as
i
understand
it
from
the
comptrollers’
representatives
here,
as
a
matter
of
his
regular
interpretation
as
borne
out
in
his
inspections
of
banks
and
their
trustees.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
do
not
think
this
is
a
matter
of
--
i
do
not
believe
this
is
a
matter
of
written
ruling.
i
understand
that
it
is
the
practice
and
it
has
been
carried
out
for
a
long
time.
this
is
what
the
comptroller’s
representatives
inform
me
of
it,
as
i
understood
them
during
the
recess.
i
may
say
in
addition
that
there
is
in
the
bank’s
prospectus
a
perfectly
clear
statement
that
the
fund
will
not
borrow
money,
and
of
course
in
addition
or
as
stated
in
any
number
of
authorities
on
trust
including
professor’s
scott’s
book,
a
corporate
trustee
--
a
corporation
may
not
sell
money
--
sell
property
to
itself
as
fiduciary.
so
i
really
think
this
point
is
quite
thoroughly
buttoned
up.
the
third
point
i
would
emphasize
as
sustaining
the
comptrollers
and
the
fed's
conclusion
that
this
is
a
fiduciary
relationship
is
the
safeguards
in
section
--
in
regulation
9.
mr.
archibald
cox
or
selling
to
the
property.
no
corporate
fund
of
new
york
--
mr.
archibald
cox
a
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well
--
mr.
archibald
cox
because
this
fund
wouldn’t
have
to
fall
at
mortgagors.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
is
a
common
stock
fund.
mr.
archibald
cox
don’t
think
it
has
and
would
not
have
mortgage
in
this.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
there’s
specific
limitations
in
the
plan
that
was
submitted
to
the
comptroller
and
that
he
approved
in
their
specific
limitations
in
their
prospectus.
the
question
your
honor
raises
might
come
up
in
connection
with
other
plans
under
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don’t
think
this
plan
has
anything
to
do
with
mortgage
funds
mr.
justice.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
there
are
many
sayings,
there
are
many
sayings
and
regulation
9
which
covers
all
fiduciary
activities
that
are
not
applicable
to
the
commingled
investment
account.
the
third
aspect
of
the
commingled
investment
account
which
supports
the
conclusion
that
it
is
a
true
fiduciary
function
are
the
safeguards
that
the
comptrollers
impose
to
assure
that
it
is
not
corrupted
by
aggressive
merchandising.
there
is
no
public
distribution,
a
principal
and
customer
may
obtain
participations
or
an
opportunity
to
participate
only
through
the
bank
itself.
there
is
no
like
--
unlike
a
mutual
fund,
there
is
no
distribution
through
the
usual
channels
of
securities
distribution.
advertising
is
very
rigidly
limited
by
regulation
9
and
there
are
limits
imposed
on
the
bank’s
compensation.
in
addition,
regulation
9
prevents
any
load
to
pay
a
commission
to
salesmen
of
managing
agency
accounts
and
this
is
the
federal
reserve
board
notice
is
one
of
the
things
which
will
put
a
limitation
on
the
extent
to
which
the
banks
can
secure
this
kind
of
business.
fourth,
i
would
emphasize
that
the
commingled
investment
account
and
commingling
under
regulation
9
is
subject
to
continuing
scrutiny
by
the
comptroller.
under
his
normal
trust
powers,
he’s
required
by
law
to
investigate
three
times
in
every
two
years.
i
am
told
that
in
the
case
of
the
city
bank
account
representatives
have
been
there
every
year
and
they
conduct
of
course,
a
very
careful
audit.
and
finally,
the
comptroller
had
the
opportunity
to
take
advantage
of
the
years
of
experience
with
other
forms
of
investment
in
common
trust
and
to
judge
that
the
commingled
investment
did
not
in
fact
reduce
the
fiduciary
nature
of
the
arrangement.
so,
we
come
i
think
to
the
question
whether
this
traditional
lawful
aspect
of
a
banking
function
or
rather
this
new
aspect
of
a
traditional
banking
function
is
somehow
prohibited
by
the
glass-steagall
act,
and
we
think
for
a
number
of
reasons
that
the
glass-steagall
act
does
not
prohibit
the
activity.
but
first,
i
would
emphasize
that
the
words
of
the
statute
do
not
cover
of
the
managing
of
investments
in
a
fiduciary
capacity
on
behalf
of
others.
taking
section
21
which
is
probably
the
broadest
prohibition,
that’s
on
page
4a
of
the
appendix
to
my
brief.
what
it
says
that
a
commercial
banker
may
not
do
is
engage
in
the
business
of
issuing
underwriting,
selling
or
distributing
at
wholesale
or
retail
or
through
syndicate
participation
stocks,
bonds,
or
other
securities.
i
submit
that
those
words
are
plainly
directed
at
a
bank’s
purchasing
and
selling
securities
as
investments
for
its
own
account,
and
that
a
bank’s
acting
as
a
middleman
in
handling
securities
from
the
distribution
of
which
it
hopes
to
make
a
commission
or
profit,
the
normal
business
of
an
investment
banker.
and
the
word
issue
in
here
seems
to
me
to
be
used
in
the
sense
in
which
it
was
very
commonly
used
during
the
20’s
and
early
30’s
and
that
is
to
say
it’s
a
house
of
issue
was
bargaining
or
might
be
the
house
of
issue
and
not
in
the
more
technical
sense
in
which
it
has
come
to
be
used
under
the
securities
law.
and
i
would
urge
that
the
units
of
participation
which
the
bank
gives
to
its
customers
as
receipts
really
don’t
affect
the
matter.
the
units
are
simply
the
mechanism
by
which
the
bank
accounts
to
its
customers
for
its
performance
of
its
fiduciary
duties.
the
units
are
traded
in
security
markets.
the
bank
does
not
handle
them
as
a
house
of
issue,
as
a
dealer
or
as
any
other
middleman
with
the
hope
of
an
issuers
or
dealer’s
risk
or
their
profit.
second,
we
would
emphasize
that
the
interpretation
which
the
court
below
put
on
the
glass-steagall
act
and
which
we
urge
here,
the
bank’s
engaging
in
this
activity
is
in
no
wise
contrary
to
the
purposes
of
the
glass-steagall
act.
they’re
very
well
known.
they
were
first
to
prevent
a
bank
from
risking
its
own
assets
in
securities,
especially
speculative
securities
and
of
course
the
bank
has
no
assets
at
risk
here.
second,
they
were
intended
to
prevent
banks
from
investing
in
securities
and
then
endangering
their
solvency
by
making
loans
to
bail
out
that
investment.
and
since
the
bank
has
nothing
at
risk
here,
that
temptation
doesn’t
exist.
and
third,
the
glass-steagall
act
was
attended
to
prevent
banks
from
acquiring
issues
of
securities
and
then
putting
pressure
on
its
correspondents
and
on
its
customers
and
their
customers
in
order
to
sell
the
securities
in
which
it’s
invested
without
loss
so
as
to
make
its
middleman’s
profit,
and
of
course
there
is
no
such
thing
involved
in
the
present
case.
third,
i
would
point
out
that
it
is
agreed
on
all
hands
that
the
glass-steagall
act
does
not
apply
in
words
or
policy
to
the
bank’s
managing
investments
and
securities
on
behalf
of
customers
in
any
other
fiduciary
capacity
and
every
reason
that
excludes
those
cases,
whether
a
reason
in
terms
of
words
or
reason
in
terms
of
the
policy
applies
equally
to
the
city
bank
plan.
fourth,
i
submit
that
petitioner’s
argument
is
wholly
technical.
it
rests
entirely
upon
form
of
the
concepts
adopted
to
comply
with
the
investment
company
act.
indeed,
i
think
it’s
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
the
petitioners
do
not
cite
a
single
substantive
objection
to
the
account
that
it
is
not
equally
applicable
to
all
the
other
fiduciary
activities
that
are
undertaken
pursuant
to
section
92
(a)
and
certainly
are
not
affected
by
glass-steagall.
and
finally,
i
would
urge
that
there’s
no
basis
at
all
for
the
petitioner's
major
premise
here.
the
assumption
that
activity
is
subject
to
the
investment
company
act
must
somehow
be
prohibited
the
banks
by
the
glass-steagall
act.
that
doesn’t
follow.
the
two
may,
and
indeed
we
urge
do
overlap.
as
judge
bazelon
said,
the
acts
have
different
policies.
they
deal
with
different
subject
and
nothing
in
either
suggest
the
ironic
conclusion
that
i
mentioned
before
lunch
that
a
bank
managed
commingled
investment
account
which
doesn't
violate
section
1621.
if
you
don’t
give
your
fiduciaries,
your
customers
the
benefit
of
the
investment
company
act
somehow
becomes
unlawful
when
you
do,
which
as
i
say
is
indeed
is
ironic.
now,
the
petitioner’s
argument
as
i
understand
it
reduces
itself
somewhat
to
a
syllogism
and
in
a
sense
i
think
mr.
vieth
assumed
a
large
part
of
the
answer
to
the
case
in
his
first
statement
during
the
argument
this
morning.
the
syllogism
is
the
bank
everybody
concedes
that
the
mutual
fund
engages
in
the
kind
of
activities
in
which
a
bank
cannot
engage
or
which
it
could
not
affiliated
under
the
glass-steagall
act.
minor
premise,
city
bank’s
account
is
engaged
in
the
same
activities
as
the
mutual
fund
and
then
the
conclusion
is
that
we
violate
the
glass-steagall
act.
now,
we
deny
both
the
major
and
the
minor
premise,
and
if
we’re
right
on
either
account,
then
we’re
right
in
our
conclusion.
the
first
place
we
do
not
concede
that
a
mutual
fund,
certainly
a
no
load
mutual
fund
is
engaged
in
activities
of
a
kind
with
which
a
bank
cannot
be
connected
under
the
glass-steagall
act.
the
petitioners
until
this
case
were
arguing
just
the
opposite,
and
i
think
the
logic
of
a
good
many
of
the
arguments
in
our
brief
is
that
they
were
right
the
first
time.
the
federal
reserve
board
has
ruled
to
the
contrary
in
the
case
of
the
ordinary
mutual
fund,
but
that
isn’t
the
end
of
the
matter
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
that
isn’t
the
reason
to
begin
the
decision
of
this
case
by
assuming
the
correctness
of
the
federal
reserve
board
conclusions,
instead
of
going
back
as
i’ve
tried
to
do
to
the
words
of
the
statute
and
to
its
basic
policy.
now
second,
even
if
the
ordinary
mutual
fund
is
engaged
in
the
kind
of
activities
with
which
a
bank
is
--
which
are
forbidden
to
a
bank
or
with
which
it
is
forbidden
to
be
connected.
still
we
say
that
the
city
bank’s
account
is
not
in
violation
of
the
glass-steagall
act
because
we
think
it’s
a
markedly
different
situation
from
the
ordinary
mutual
fund.
in
some
of
the
banks,
indeed
for
the
most
part,
for
the
purposes
of
the
investment
company
act
were
the
same,
just
as
for
many
purposes
if
i
can
be
personal
about
it.
i’m
the
same
as
any
other
teacher
or
professor,
but
for
the
purpose
of
appearing
before
the
court,
i’m
not,
and
so
here.
we
say
that
for
many
purposes,
what
we’re
doing
may
be
the
same
as
what
a
mutual
fund
is
doing,
but
for
the
purposes
of
glass-steagall,
it’s
not.
and
we
would
stress
four
important
differences.
first,
i’ve
mentioned
it
several
times,
the
direct
fiduciary
relationship
between
the
bank
and
its
customers
which
does
not
exist
in
the
case
of
the
shareholder
in
a
mutual
fund
and
the
managers
of
the
fund.
second
of
course,
the
bank
--
mr.
archibald
cox
some
of
them
are
in
the
form
of
trusts.
massachusetts
investor’s
trust
is
in
the
form
of
a
trust
and
in
those
cases
there
maybe
that
direct
fiduciary.
mr.
archibald
cox
it’s
not
--
there
isn’t
quite
the
same
individual
relationship
i
think
that
there
is
here
where
the
bank
has
the
relationship
of
principle
and
agent.
but
i
would
go
on
and
even
if
those
cases
had
answered
others.
here
of
course
every
thing
what
the
bank
does
is
subject
to
regulation
9
and
the
comptroller’s
supervision,
and
that
is
not
true
either
with
the
massachusetts
investor’s
trust
or
the
other
mutual
funds.
third,
it
must
be
remembered
that
95%
of
the
shares
in
mutual
funds
are
marketed
as
if
they
were
ordinary
securities
through
the
ordinary
channels
of
the
securities
business.
they
advertised
on
television
whereas
the
bank’s
just
seeking
of
new
accounts
in
this
area
is
strictly
limited.
and
fourth,
and
i
think
perhaps
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it
can
advertise
them
and
it
can
advertise
this
in
connection
with
the
trust
services
provided
it
also
meets
the
requirements
of
the
sec
which
makes
it
very
difficult
to
advertise
the
trust
services
with
the
commingled
fund
together.
mr.
archibald
cox
about
here
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
i
think
so.
mr.
archibald
cox
what
it
can
do
is
on
page
24a
in
reg.
9,
it
may
have
a
report.
a
full
report
should
be
furnished
upon
request
to
any
person
and
the
fact
that
the
availability
of
such
material
may
be
given
publicity
solely
in
connection
with
the
promotion
of
the
fiduciary
services
of
the
bank,
except
this
herein
provided,
the
bank
shall
not
advertise
or
publicized
its
collective
investment
funds,
it’s
down
toward
the
bottom
of
the
page.
so,
there
are
rather
strict
limitations,
except
for
this
initial
mailing
about
all
the
bank
has
done
as
i
understand
it
is
to
have
a
slip
that’s
available
at
the
desks
in
the
branch
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it
can
bring
people
into
the
bank
--
mr.
archibald
cox
then
it
can
mention
in
this
far,
that’s
true.
and
then
fourth
part
is
that
from
the
standpoint
of
the
glass-steagall
act
i
submit,
all
the
account’s
activities
are
the
banks
activities.
now,
this
is
important
as
i
see
it
not
only
in
terms
of
the
entity
theory
which
is
the
federal
reserve
board
said
meant
that
there
was
no
violation
of
sections
21
and
32.
i
guess
i
have
mixed,
20
and
32,
but
it
also
i
think
characterizes
all
the
bank’s
activities
because
what
it
means
in
a
nutshell
is
that
the
bank,
nor
any
officer
of
the
bank
neither
has
any
interest
in
the
distribution
of
the
securities
of
any
other
organization,
or
any
interests
in
the
ownership
of
the
securities
of
any
other
organization,
and
it
is
those
things
that
i
submit
were
really
what
the
glass-steagall
act
was
directed
against,
that
the
bank
doesn’t
have,
nor
does
any
officer
have
that
kind
of
interest.
in
conclusion,
i
would
simply
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
federal
reserve
board
explicitly
advised
the
congress
that
for
the
purposes
of
separating
commercial
banking
from
investment
banking,
it
was
speaking
of
the
glass-steagall
policy,
are
not
significantly
relevant
to
the
operations
of
the
kind
under
discussion.
we
submit
therefore
that
the
petitioners
have
failed
to
show
that
the
agencies
findings
are
so
ill-considered
or
arbitrary
or
foolish
that
the
court
should
set
them
aside
and
consequently
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
justice
black
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
was
remarked
earlier,
this
is
one
of
two
related
cases.
but
i
think
there
is
one
respect
in
which
they
were
not
quite
correctly
described.
it
is
true
as
i
understand
it
that
if
the
case
to
be
argued
tomorrow,
the
ici
case
should
be
reversed,
then
this
case
seizes
to
be
important.
but
on
the
other
hand
justice
stewart,
even
if
the
exemption
should
be
held
improper
which
of
course
we
denied,
then
the
ici
case
still
would
be
important.
first,
because
regulation
9
is
an
issue
in
the
ici
case
and
because
there
is
some
reason
to
believe
that
it
would
be
possible
to
operate
managing
agency
commingled
investment
accounts.
even
so,
there
were
no
exemptions
from
section
10(c).
that’s
a
moot
point.
i
don’t
mean
to
say
the
exemption
isn’t
important
but
it
isn't
quite
accurate
to
say
that
if
it
were
denied,
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
managing
agency
commingled
investment
account,
speaking
of
them
as
a
category
not
of
this
particular
plan.
mr.
archibald
cox
two
things
are
possible
as
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
explained
in
the
amicus
brief
by
the
fiduciary
associations
of
chicago.
one
is
it
is
possible
that
it
might
be
held
that
the
entire
commingling
authorized
by
a
regulation
9
is
not
under
the
investment
company
act.
mr.
archibald
cox
second,
it
is
possible
that
the
federal
reserve
board
which
has
given
its
approval
to
these
plans
and
found
them
in
the
public
interest
might
find
it
sufficient
that
the
bank
had
the
contract
to
act
as
investment
advisor
and
two
bank
officers
on
the
board
of
directors.
we
couldn’t
be
sure
of
that,
that’s
why
we
asked
permission
to
have
three
so
that
it
really
would
be
wholly
within
the
bank.
but
if
it
had
to
go
the
other
way
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don’t
think
the
whole
thing
could
fairly
be
said
to
be
debt.
mr.
archibald
cox
certainly
not
clearly
vice-versa.
there
are
two
general
observations
which
i
think
are
pertinent
to
both
cases.
in
the
first
place,
it’s
important
not
to
slip
into
such
question
begging
characterizations
as
mutual
fund,
investment
company,
securities
business
are
on
our
side,
fiduciary
relation.
the
real
question
here
is
which
is
the
right
characterization?
and
of
course,
the
right
characterization
depends
upon
examination
of
what
it
is
that
the
bank
is
actually
doing.
second,
the
right
characterization
has
been
decided
in
these
cases
by
the
expert
agencies
unanimously,
in
favor
of
the
view
that
what
the
bank
is
doing
is
performing
a
traditional
fiduciary
banking
function.
in
a
way,
that
preserves
the
fiduciary
relationship
and
which
is
in
the
public
interests.
this
is
a
view
supported
not
only
by
the
comptroller
but
by
the
federal
reserve
board
both
in
its
ruling
given
to
city
bank
and
in
its
testimony
before
congress
by
the
federal
deposit
insurance
company,
by
the
new
york
banking
authorities
in
parallel
situations
and
to
the
extent
that
it
was
pertinent
under
the
investment
company
act
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
and
so
here,
the
question
i
think
is
not
as
mr.
levin’s
argument
suggests
whether
the
commission
could
properly
exempt
an
ordinary
investment
company
from
section
10(c).
but
rather,
it’s
whether
the
commission
made
a
permissible
expert
judgment,
when
it
concluded
that
this
is
not
the
kind
of
investment
company
with
which
the
purpose
of
section
10(c)
was
primarily
concerned.
but
as
i
say,
a
fiduciary
banking
activity
which
could
be
exempted
without
departing
from
the
purposes
or
policy
of
the
act
and
which
should
be
exempted
in
the
public
interest
that
the
commission
was
correct
in
that
finding.
but
it
becomes
apparent
when
one
goes
behind
the
labels
and
looks
at
the
development
of
the
commingled
investment
account.
and
to
do
that,
it’s
really
necessary
to
go
back
to
1913
when
section
11(k)
of
the
federal
reserve
act
gave
the
federal
reserve
board
a
power
to
issue
to
national
banks,
permits
to
act
in
sundry
fiduciary
capacities.
the
present
language
of
then
modifications
is
set
forth
at
page
1(a)
of
our
brief
and
it
describes
these
powers
as
the
right
to
act
as
trustee,
executer,
administrator
and
so
forth
or
over
on
the
next
page,
in
any
other
fiduciary
capacity
in
which
state
banks
can
act.
and
there's
no
doubt
that
state
banks
could
act
in
this
capacity
under
the
law
of
new
york.
under
this
section,
banks
have
of
course
long
activities,
trustees,
executives,
guardians
and
so
forth.
they’ve
also
acted
as
agents
to
keep
custody
in
a
customer’s
assets,
securities
and
to
give
him
advice
concerning
investments
with
the
customer
retaining
the
final
decision
whether
to
change
his
securities.
in
addition,
banks
have
frequently
acted
as
managing
agents
in
the
strict
sense.
that
is
to
say
the
customer
turns
over
his
assets
to
them
and
the
bank
makes
and
executes
all
investment
decisions
concerning
the
management
of
the
customer’s
assets
where
they
drew
fiduciary
relationship
between
the
principal
and
the
agent.
and
i
would
emphasize
that
this
was
only
one
of
many
fiduciary
activities.
all
of
which
belong
in
a
single
bundle.
now
at
first
--
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
i
pointed
out
that
since
the
federal
reserve
act
of
1913,
managing
other
people’s
money’s
in
various
fiduciary
capacities
has
been
a
traditional
banking
function.
and
that
the
individual
managing
agency
account
has
been
one
way
of
performing
that
function
along
with
testamentary
trust,
inter
vivos
trust,
executorships
and
the
like
and
other
forms
of
agency.
in
the
beginning,
the
federal
reserve
board
followed
the
common
law
and
forbade
national
banks
to
commingle
the
assets
of
different
beneficiaries
or
different
principles.
about
1920,
it
began
relax
that
rule.
and
in
1937,
there
came
a
major
relaxation
that
permitted
the
commingling
of
the
101
of
different
trust
executorships
and
guardianships
and
the
like.
and
under
that
new
regulation,
the
now
familiar
common
trust
fund
grew
and
flourished.
partly,
i
think
because
the
economies
of
commingling
which
reduced
the
management
cost
and
partly
because
of
the
advantages
of
diversification.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
statute
goes
back
to
1913.
the
commingling
was
not
authorized
until
about
1920
then
on
a
very
small
scale.
and
then
commingling
on
the
scale
that
we’re
all
familiar
with
for
the
common
trust
fund
came
in
1937.
but
in
1937,
the
rule
was
not
relaxed
so
far
as
individual
managing
agency
accounts
are
concerned.
it
was
relaxed
for
all
other
fiduciary
capacity.
mr.
archibald
cox
executorships,
guardianships
and
the
like.
mr.
archibald
cox
managed
by
the
banks
of
course.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
the
effect
of
regulation
9
which
is
an
issue
in
the
next
case
is
to
extend
to
managing
agencies,
the
same
privilege
to
commingle
that
it
proved
to
be
successful
and
so
free
from
abuse
in
the
case
of
trust
and
that
kind
of
fiduciary
capacity.
indeed,
if
you
will
look
--
when
you
come
to
look
at
regulation
9,
you
would
see
that
it
treats
commingling
strict
trust
funds
and
managing
agency
funds
in
exactly
parallel
capacity.
the
reasons
for
this
were
very
well
stated
somewhat
later
by
the
federal
reserve
board
in
a
letter
to
the
congress
speaking
of
the
public
interest
in
having
banks
continue
to
offer
this
kind
of
managing
agency
commingled
investment
account
and
a
letter
quoted
in
the
back
of
our
brief
on
page
35
(a).
we
had
pointed
out
that
there
were
three
advantages.
first,
this
was
a
means
of
performing
a
traditional
banking
function
more
efficiently
and
at
less
cost.
second,
that
it
provided
competition
for
the
mutual
funds
which
of
course
in
these
cases
are
seeking
to
preserve
a
monopolistic
or
quasi-monopolistic
position
free
from
competition.
and
third,
that
in
special
cases,
it
enabled
a
combination
of
investment
and
other
special
fiduciary
services.
during
the
time
that
regulation
9
was
under
consideration,
the
securities
in
exchange
commission
took
the
position
that
any
commingled
fund
of
managing
agency
accounts
would
be
subject
to
the
investment
company
act.
it
said
that
the
interest
in
the
fund
would
be
securities,
that
the
fund
or
the
bank
would
be
an
issuer
or
underwriter
and
that
consequently,
there
had
to
be
registration
under
the
investment
company
act.
i
would
point
out
in
this
connection
however
and
indeed
emphasize
that
while
the
sec
and
chairman
cary
and
chairman
cohen
stood
very
stoutly
on
the
position
that
there
must
be
conformity
with
the
investment
company
act.
they
never
took
the
view
that
the
managing
agency
commingled
investment
account.
it
was
unlawful
or
in
anyway
against
the
public
interest.
indeed
from
the
very
beginning,
chairman
cary
later
chairman
cohen
and
the
staff
all
indicated
that
they
would
look
favorably
at
exempting
a
managing
agency
commingled
investment
account.
for
many
of
the
provisions
of
the
investment
company
act
that
might
be
a
bar
to
performing
the
function
authorized
by
the
comptroller
under
regulation
9
and
later
approved
by
the
federal
reserve
board.
mr.
archibald
cox
not
at
all,
no.
and
the
1940
act
would
not
be
applicable
to
the
type
of
common
trust
fund
involving
an
inter-vivo
or
testamentary
trust
because
it
is
expressly
exempted.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
that’s
correct.
it
was
the
pooling
that
the
sec
said
brought
it
under
the
investment
company
act.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
not
justice
white.
i
think
their
position
was
that
even
if
there
were
no
piece
of
paper,
it
would
be
the
interest,
the
undivided
interest
would
nevertheless
be
regarded
as
something
that
brought
them
under
the
investment
company
act.
that’s
my
understanding
of
the
testimony.
of
course
as
we
do
it
there
are
those
certificates.
mr.
archibald
cox
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
--
we
say
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
out
our
fiduciary
responsibilities
and
for
no
other
purpose.
it
was
a
controversy
between
the
comptroller
and
the
commission
which
led
to
congressional
hearings.
during
that
controversy,
city
bank
developed
the
plan
in
which
it
was
believed
would
comply
both
with
the
requirements
of
the
banking
laws
and
be
satisfactory
to
the
sec
under
the
investment
company
act.
and
what
it
contemplated
was
this.
city
bank
would
continue
to
receive
assets
in
their
fiduciary
capacity
under
the
relation
of
managing
agent
and
principle
with
all
the
fiduciary
duties.
and
it
was
discretion
to
invest
those
through
a
common
fund.
to
the
extent
necessary
to
comply
with
the
investment
company
act,
the
common
fund
or
account
as
it
came
to
be
called,
was
given
a
separate
structure.
the
principles,
the
customer
investors
were
given
certificates
of
participation
which
were
nonassignable
and
nontransferable
which
would
terminate
upon
their
death.
the
certificate
holders
were
given
the
right
to
choose
as
they
wished
a
committee
made
up
of
five
individuals
as
it
developed,
two
of
whom
were
not
required
to
be
connected
with
the
bank.
and
the
committee
or
the
participants
were
given
power
to
terminate
the
bank’s
investment
adviser
contract
and
anytime
at
the
end
of
the
year.
that
subject
however
to
the
possibility
of
that
is
very
small.
the
bank
has
a
custody
of
all
the
assets,
manages,
tends
to
them
in
every
way,
chooses
what
investments
to
make
and
to
change
and
so
forth.
so,
in
the
ordinary
day-to-day
operation,
the
whole
thing
is
carried
out
by
the
bank
subject
only
to
this
possibility
of
the
certificate
holders
exercising
common
control
to
kick
the
bank
out.
there
are
a
few
other
minor
departures.
they’re
outlined
in
our
brief
in
footnote
12.
none
of
them,
i
think
affect
the
theory
or
the
fiduciary
relation.
certainly
none
affect
the
individual
fiduciary
relation
between
the
bank
and
the
customer
investor’s
principles.
and
the
bank
continues
to
be
required
to
conform.
in
all
respects
except
i’ve
mentioned
and
the
other
details
to
the
provisions
of
regulation
that.
now,
from
the
standpoint
of
the
banking
laws,
it
seemed
important
that
all
these
activities
be
conducted
as
the
federal
reserve
board
later
put
it
as
an
arm
or
department
of
the
bank
as
one
of
many
functions
within
the
trust
department
of
the
bank.
and
while
the
managing
--
while
the
investment
advisers
contract
alone
might
be
enough
to
do
that.
it
seemed
advisable
to
the
bank
and
its
lawyers
that
a
majority
of
the
board
of
directors
should
also
be
officers
of
the
bank.
and
it
was
that
that
led
to
the
application
for
an
exemption
from
section
10(c)
which
provides
that
a
bank
may
not
have
a
majority
of
the
board
of
directors
of
an
investment
company.
when
the
matter
came
before
the
sec,
it
made
three
critical
findings.
the
first
on
page
60,
points
out
that
this
account
which
is
technically
an
investment
company.
mr.
archibald
cox
page
60
of
the
appendix.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
it
pointed
out
that
this
was
not
the
kind
of
investment
company
and
at
with
section
10(c)
appeared
to
be
(a).
although
section
10(c)
is
general
in
terms,
it
does
not
appear
that
it
was
directed
at
the
type
of
open-ended
investment
company
represented
by
the
account
and
then
skipping
a
few
sentences.
it
is
clear
that
the
account
is
substantially
different
both
in
purpose
and
nature
of
operation
from
the
bank
dominated
investment
companies
which
led
to
passage
of
the
act.
the
second
finding
is
over
on
page
62.
in
our
opinion
in
the
commission
sent,
the
bank
you
shown
that
substantial
safeguards
are
present
here
against
conflicts
of
interest
which
could
arise
as
a
result
of
the
bank’s
commercial
banking
activities.
and
the
third
finding
which
is
in
flaccid
is
that
the
exemption
to
permit
these
activities
to
go
forward
would
be
in
the
public
interest.
we
submit
first
in
our
legal
argument
that
if
these
findings
are
reasonable,
these
conclusions
are
reasonable.
then,
the
commissions
order
is
plainly
valid.
section
6(c)
of
the
statute
which
is
on
the
back
of
our
brief
on
page
7(a)
plainly
gives
the
commission
the
power
to
exempt
any
person
conditionally
or
unconditionally
from
any
provision
or
provisions
of
this
title.
surely
the
words
in
a
provision
or
provision
to
this
title
are
broad
enough
to
encompass
the
provisions
of
section
10(c).
and
the
fact
that
literally
the
bank,
the
account
that
falls
within
section
10(c),
does
not
defeat
the
power
to
exempt
because
of
course
the
very
purpose
of
the
power
to
exempt
is
to
take
care
of
cases
which
literally
fall
within
the
language
of
the
statute.
furthermore,
that
has
been
the
consistent
interpretation
of
section
10(c)
for
28
years.
it
was
explained
to
congress
when
section
10(c)
was
pending
before
it
in
1940.
that
the
aim
was
to
take
care
of
cases
which
had
not
been
foreseen
by
the
drafts
which
might
fall
within
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
but
in
the
judgment
of
the
commission
not
really
within
its
policy
or
spirit.
at
the
time,
section
10(c)
was
before
congress,
there
was
no
commingling
of
managing
agency
accounts.
common
trust
funds,
the
nearest
analog
were
exempted
from
the
investment
company
act.
and
consequently
i
suggest
that
if
the
commission’s
findings
are
reasonable
then
this
is
a
classic
case
for
an
exemption.
the
commission’s
finding
that
the
proposed
relationship
between
city
bank
and
the
account
is
not
the
kind
addressed
by
section
10(c).
it
seems
to
me
to
be
supported
by
five
considerations.
first,
the
type
of
investment
company
with
which
congress
was
concerned
in
1940
when
it
was
debating
section
10(c).
was
a
close-end
investment
company,
a
fixed
pool
of
securities
which
bank
insiders
were
selling
very
largely
in
the
hope
of
making
their
own
profit,
a
company
in
which
they
certainly
had
an
interest.
this
account
of
course,
is
wholly
the
property
of
the
customers,
the
principles.
it’s
run
solely
for
their
benefit
and
the
bank
gets
nothing
more
from
it
than
the
usual
fee
that
it
gets
for
any
fiduciary
service
of
the
subject
to
the
comptroller
of
the
currency.
second,
those
investment
companies
for
the
most
part
purported
to
be
independent
concerns
with
as
--
when
the
customer
but
it’s
not
the
customer,
when
the
investor
bought
a
share,
he
thought
he
was
buying
a
share
in
the
investment
company.
and
if
the
bank
through
its
control
over
the
directors
dominated
it,
he
wasn’t
getting
something
free
from
the
influence
of
the
bank.
here
of
course
when
he
goes
to
the
bank
and
opens
his
managing
agency
account.
what
he
is
looking
for
is
the
bank
services.
and
what
he
gets
subject
to
this
power
of
ultimate
control
is
the
bank
services
throughout
the
entire
enterprise.
third,
i
would
emphasize
that
there
is
in
this
instance
but
not
in
the
kind
of
investment
company
at
which
section
10(c)
is
concerned,
a
direct
fiduciary
relation
between
the
bank
and
the
individual
customer
investment.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it
would
be
the
common
law,
i
presume
of
new
york
and
that
would
be
backed
up
by
the
regulations
of
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
in
regulation
9
which
spell
out
many
of
the
duties
and
of
course
the
comptroller
annually
inspects
the
fund
as
he
does
in
other
banking
activities
also
and
not
always
quite
that
often.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
no.
they’re
rigidly
forbidden
by
regulation
9
and
also
by
the
investment
company
act
to
have
any
dealings
with
the
account.
mr.
archibald
cox
both
reg.
9.
mr.
archibald
cox
any
investments
must
be
outside.
they
may
make
no
loans
to
the
account.
they
may
have
no
interest
in
the
securities
that
the
account
acquires.
indeed,
regulation
9
even
would
restrict
the
bank
from
buying
securities
of
companies
to
which
it
has
made
a
shaky
loan,
of
where
that
would
be
a
breach
of
trust
and
the
controller’s
representatives
have
instructed
to
be
on
the
lookout
for
such
things
in
the
instruction
we’ve
putted
on
our
brief.
i
would
emphasize
that
this
direct
fiduciary
relationship
was
noted
by
the
district
court
in
the
ici
case.
it
spelled
out
in
the
hoga
affidavit,
the
executive
vice
president
of
the
bank
in
the
ici
case.
it
was
also
noted
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
sec.
a
fourth
difference
between
the
investment
company
at
which
section
10(c)
was
directed
and
the
account
is
of
course
that
the
securities
affiliates
and
the
associated
investment
companies
at
which
section
10(c)
was
directed
were
set
out
for
the
purpose
of
evading
the
banking
laws
and
getting
out
from
under
scrutiny
of
the
controller.
i
perhaps
shouldn’t
say
vague
but
avoid,
i
don’t
meant
there
was
any
deceit
about
it
whereas
all
these
activities
are
carried
on
as
i
said
a
moment
ago
constantly
under
the
control
of
the
controller.
the
result
is
from
those
four
differences
that
none
of
the
evils
which
were
pointed
to
during
the
investigation
and
the
bank
securities
affiliates
and
bank
dominated
investment
companies
are
possible
the
presence
setup.
indeed,
not
even
the
petitioners
argue
that
they
are.
mr.
lewin(ph)
argues
that
the
sec
findings
are
immaterial
because
section
10(c)
imposes
a
rigid
barrier
to
the
banks
ever
having
a
majority
on
the
board
of
directors
where
there
is
any
possible
conflict
of
interest.
even
so
it’s
found
that
this
is
not
the
kind
of
thing
that
10(c)
was
directed
at,
even
so
the
commission
finds
that
there
are
adequate
safeguards
and
even
so
the
commission
finds
that
the
existence
of
the
account
is
in
the
public
interest.
i
submit
that
that
argument
is
unsupportable
for
four
reasons.
first,
it’s
certainly
contrary
to
the
plain
words
of
section
6(c)
which
give
power
to
exempt
without
restriction
except
for
the
necessary
findings.
second,
and
very
important,
the
characteristics
of
the
account
or
the
relationship
between
the
bank
and
the
account
that
are
said
to
give
rise
to
the
danger
of
abuse
here
are
characteristics
that
are
attendant
upon
all
fiduciary
banking
functions
and
we
know
that
congress
didn’t
find
them
so
dangerous
as
to
prohibit
this
kind
of
relationship
because
it
authorized
such
fiduciary
banking
functions
in
section
11(k)
of
the
federal
reserve
act
now
title
12
section
92(a).
it
would
certainly
be
incongruous
if
congress
somehow
had
singled
out
this
one
special
form
of
activity
which
is
just
like
the
others,
so
far
as
any
of
these
problems
are
concerned,
and
forbidden
it,
especially
since
in
this
case,
but
has
not
only
the
usual
safeguards
of
the
fiduciary
relationship
in
the
controller
supervision
but
one
has
the
additional
safeguards
of
the
investment
company
act.
we’ve
outlined
in
our
brief,
a
number
of
indications
as
the
commission
did
in
its
opinion
that
the
board
was
--
that
the
congress
was
not
seeking
such
a
rigid
separation
between
banks
and
investment
companies
as
mr.
levin
argues.
there’s
a
grandfather
clause
in
section
10(c).
banks
are
allowed
to
act
as
investment
advisers
which
from
a
day-to-day
point
of
view
is
the
really
controlling
manager
of
the
investing
company
and
of
course,
we
lay
great
stress
on
this.
the
one
form
of
commingling
that
was
none
at
the
time
the
investment
company
act
was
adopted,
the
common
trust
fund
was
exempted
from
the
investment
company
act.
an
important
analog
even
though
the
commission
said
we
couldn’t
bring
ourselves
within
it.
the
remaining
question
is
whether
there
was
adequate
support
for
the
sec
findings
that
there
were
adequate
safeguards
against
abuse
of
the
banks
control
over
the
fund
to
the
detriment
of
investors.
the
commission
took
up
point
by
point
all
the
abuses
which
it
was
said
might
result
and
found
that
they
were
not
sufficiently
serious
and
that
they
were
adequate
safeguards
against
them.
judge
bazelon
took
them
up
point
by
point
as
the
same
arguments
were
made
to
the
controller
and
he
rejected
them.
the
federal
reserve
board
scrutinized
most
of
them
in
the
letter
that
is
set
forth
at
the
end
of
our
brief.
and
it
concluded
too
that
there
were
adequate
safeguards
and
that
the
existence
of
such
funds
would
be
in
the
public
interest.
consequently,
we
submit
that
the
commission’s
findings
are
reasonably
based
in
the
record
and
that
its
judgment
ended
its
order,
should
therefore
be
affirmed
and
the
order
--
and
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
affirm.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
justice
black
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case
as
in
the
one
before
it,
we
start
with
the
unanimous
conclusion
of
all
the
expert
regulatory
agencies
that
what
the
bank
is
doing
is
carrying
on
a
somewhat
new
form
of
a
traditional
banking
function
which
is
not
prohibited
by
existing
law
and
which
is
in
the
public
interest
because
it
provides
a
traditional
kind
of
service
at
lower
cost
and
supplies
competition
for
what
would
otherwise
be
the
monopolistic
position
of
the
mutual
funds.
so
that
here
again,
the
general
question
involved
is
whether
petitioners
who
carried
the
very
heavy
burden
of
showing
that
the
agencies
conclusions
are
so
unreasonable
or
ill-considered,
that
they
must
be
set
aside
as
beyond
their
authority
or
otherwise
contrary
to
law
and
that
question
i
think
breaks
into
two
parts.
the
first
part
as
was
suggested
shortly
before
the
recess
is
whether
what
the
bank
is
doing
in
this
instance
is
a
lawful
banking
business
or
whether
to
put
it
in
more
exact
terms,
whether
the
bank
which
admittedly
acts
in
a
fiduciary
capacity
when
it
invests
the
funds
of
an
individual
principal
under
a
managing
agent
and
which
admittedly
acts
in
the
fiduciary
capacity
under
section
92
(a)
when
it
commingles
the
funds
of
several
beneficiaries
in
the
common
trust
fund,
somehow
ceases
to
act
in
any
fiduciary
capacity
in
the
language
of
the
statute,
when
it
commingles
the
funds
of
several
principals
into
one
account
which
the
bank
still
continues
to
manage
in
a
fiduciary
capacity
into
non-statutory
sense.
now
certainly,
the
mere
commingling
does
not
as
a
matter
of
law
destroy
the
fiduciary
capacity,
but
that
is
clear
on
any
number
of
cases.
it‘s
true
as
a
matter
of
right
of
observations
of
trust
laws
from
the
precedents.
and
second,
i
think
it
is
equally
plain
that
the
mere
registration
of
the
fund
under
the
investment
company
act
does
not
mean
that
the
bank
ceases
to
act
in
a
fiduciary
capacity.
nothing
divides
the
world
into
two
parts;
one,
the
monopoly
of
the
mutual
funds
and
the
other
a
proper
banking
function.
indeed,
the
mutual
funds
are
currently
engaged
in
buying
up
corporate
fiduciaries,
doing
the
very
sort
of
thing
that
banks
do
under
12
u.s.c.
section
92
(a)
and
surely,
nothing
requires
the
ironic
conclusion
that
something
that
you’re
properly
doing
under
section
92
(a)
suddenly
becomes
improper
if
you
go
and
provide
the
additional
protections
that
the
sec
requests
under
the
investment
company
act.
so
at
the
point
--
this
first
question
i
think
comes
down
to
whether
the
increased
number
of
customers
or
principals,
the
used
of
a
somewhat
standardized
form
of
managing
agency
agreement
and
the
pooled
investment
means
that
the
relationship,
well
perhaps
fiduciary
as
a
matter
of
law,
of
legal
concept,
ceases
to
be
a
fiduciary
relation
in
fact
or
in
function
or
whether
to
put
it
in
the
language
of
section
92
(a)
(k),
the
bank
is
abusing
its
fiduciary
power.
i
would
point
out
in
that
connection
that
section
92
(a)
(k)
expressly
gives
us
the
comptroller,
not
with
the
difference
of
this
court,
the
task
of
determining
and
issuing
regulations,
determining
what
restrictions
are
necessary
to
prevent
abuse
of
the
fiduciary
power.
we
think
that
conclusions
of
the
comptroller
that
this
remains
a
fiduciary
function
and
the
observation
of
chairman
martin
of
the
federal
reserve
board
in
writing
to
congress
that
it’s
a
traditional
fiduciary
function
are
borne
out
by
five
considerations.
in
the
first
place,
i
emphasize
again
the
individual
fiduciary
relationship
which
is
created
between
the
bank
and
each
customer
as
explained
in
the
hoe
gay
affidavit
which
is
the
only
evidence
on
the
point
in
the
record
which
is
created
between
them.
second,
the
fiduciary
duties
in
regulation
9
and
in
the
common
law
and
in
new
york
statutory
law
continue
to
characterize
this
relationship.
the
bank
is
not
permitted
to
have
any
interest
in
the
account.
it’s
not
permitted
to
deal
with
the
account.
it’s
required
to
segregate
the
property
of
the
account
from
its
own
property.
i
may
say
in
this
connection
that
the
new
york
statute
very
clearly
prohibits
a
bank
from
selling
assets
to
a
trust
or
to
this
agency
prohibits
--
mr.
archibald
cox
in
addition
to
that,
the
comptroller
interprets
section,
on
page
25a,
section
9,
18
(b)
(8(
(i)
about
the
middle
of
25a
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
of
my
brief,
excuse
me,
mr.
justice,
interprets
that
provision
as
forbidding
any
such
transactions,
whether
loan
or
sale
in
terms
of
a
collective
fund
and
he
will
not
recognize
any
exculpatory
clause
put
in
a
common
trust
fund.
this
is
the
matter
of
regular
as
i
understand
it
from
the
comptrollers’
representatives
here,
as
a
matter
of
his
regular
interpretation
as
borne
out
in
his
inspections
of
banks
and
their
trustees.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
do
not
think
this
is
a
matter
of
--
i
do
not
believe
this
is
a
matter
of
written
ruling.
i
understand
that
it
is
the
practice
and
it
has
been
carried
out
for
a
long
time.
this
is
what
the
comptroller’s
representatives
inform
me
of
it,
as
i
understood
them
during
the
recess.
i
may
say
in
addition
that
there
is
in
the
bank’s
prospectus
a
perfectly
clear
statement
that
the
fund
will
not
borrow
money,
and
of
course
in
addition
or
as
stated
in
any
number
of
authorities
on
trust
including
professor’s
scott’s
book,
a
corporate
trustee
--
a
corporation
may
not
sell
money
--
sell
property
to
itself
as
fiduciary.
so
i
really
think
this
point
is
quite
thoroughly
buttoned
up.
the
third
point
i
would
emphasize
as
sustaining
the
comptrollers
and
the
fed's
conclusion
that
this
is
a
fiduciary
relationship
is
the
safeguards
in
section
--
in
regulation
9.
mr.
archibald
cox
or
selling
to
the
property.
no
corporate
fund
of
new
york
--
mr.
archibald
cox
a
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well
--
mr.
archibald
cox
because
this
fund
wouldn’t
have
to
fall
at
mortgagors.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
is
a
common
stock
fund.
mr.
archibald
cox
don’t
think
it
has
and
would
not
have
mortgage
in
this.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
there’s
specific
limitations
in
the
plan
that
was
submitted
to
the
comptroller
and
that
he
approved
in
their
specific
limitations
in
their
prospectus.
the
question
your
honor
raises
might
come
up
in
connection
with
other
plans
under
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don’t
think
this
plan
has
anything
to
do
with
mortgage
funds
mr.
justice.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
there
are
many
sayings,
there
are
many
sayings
and
regulation
9
which
covers
all
fiduciary
activities
that
are
not
applicable
to
the
commingled
investment
account.
the
third
aspect
of
the
commingled
investment
account
which
supports
the
conclusion
that
it
is
a
true
fiduciary
function
are
the
safeguards
that
the
comptrollers
impose
to
assure
that
it
is
not
corrupted
by
aggressive
merchandising.
there
is
no
public
distribution,
a
principal
and
customer
may
obtain
participations
or
an
opportunity
to
participate
only
through
the
bank
itself.
there
is
no
like
--
unlike
a
mutual
fund,
there
is
no
distribution
through
the
usual
channels
of
securities
distribution.
advertising
is
very
rigidly
limited
by
regulation
9
and
there
are
limits
imposed
on
the
bank’s
compensation.
in
addition,
regulation
9
prevents
any
load
to
pay
a
commission
to
salesmen
of
managing
agency
accounts
and
this
is
the
federal
reserve
board
notice
is
one
of
the
things
which
will
put
a
limitation
on
the
extent
to
which
the
banks
can
secure
this
kind
of
business.
fourth,
i
would
emphasize
that
the
commingled
investment
account
and
commingling
under
regulation
9
is
subject
to
continuing
scrutiny
by
the
comptroller.
under
his
normal
trust
powers,
he’s
required
by
law
to
investigate
three
times
in
every
two
years.
i
am
told
that
in
the
case
of
the
city
bank
account
representatives
have
been
there
every
year
and
they
conduct
of
course,
a
very
careful
audit.
and
finally,
the
comptroller
had
the
opportunity
to
take
advantage
of
the
years
of
experience
with
other
forms
of
investment
in
common
trust
and
to
judge
that
the
commingled
investment
did
not
in
fact
reduce
the
fiduciary
nature
of
the
arrangement.
so,
we
come
i
think
to
the
question
whether
this
traditional
lawful
aspect
of
a
banking
function
or
rather
this
new
aspect
of
a
traditional
banking
function
is
somehow
prohibited
by
the
glass-steagall
act,
and
we
think
for
a
number
of
reasons
that
the
glass-steagall
act
does
not
prohibit
the
activity.
but
first,
i
would
emphasize
that
the
words
of
the
statute
do
not
cover
of
the
managing
of
investments
in
a
fiduciary
capacity
on
behalf
of
others.
taking
section
21
which
is
probably
the
broadest
prohibition,
that’s
on
page
4a
of
the
appendix
to
my
brief.
what
it
says
that
a
commercial
banker
may
not
do
is
engage
in
the
business
of
issuing
underwriting,
selling
or
distributing
at
wholesale
or
retail
or
through
syndicate
participation
stocks,
bonds,
or
other
securities.
i
submit
that
those
words
are
plainly
directed
at
a
bank’s
purchasing
and
selling
securities
as
investments
for
its
own
account,
and
that
a
bank’s
acting
as
a
middleman
in
handling
securities
from
the
distribution
of
which
it
hopes
to
make
a
commission
or
profit,
the
normal
business
of
an
investment
banker.
and
the
word
issue
in
here
seems
to
me
to
be
used
in
the
sense
in
which
it
was
very
commonly
used
during
the
20’s
and
early
30’s
and
that
is
to
say
it’s
a
house
of
issue
was
bargaining
or
might
be
the
house
of
issue
and
not
in
the
more
technical
sense
in
which
it
has
come
to
be
used
under
the
securities
law.
and
i
would
urge
that
the
units
of
participation
which
the
bank
gives
to
its
customers
as
receipts
really
don’t
affect
the
matter.
the
units
are
simply
the
mechanism
by
which
the
bank
accounts
to
its
customers
for
its
performance
of
its
fiduciary
duties.
the
units
are
traded
in
security
markets.
the
bank
does
not
handle
them
as
a
house
of
issue,
as
a
dealer
or
as
any
other
middleman
with
the
hope
of
an
issuers
or
dealer’s
risk
or
their
profit.
second,
we
would
emphasize
that
the
interpretation
which
the
court
below
put
on
the
glass-steagall
act
and
which
we
urge
here,
the
bank’s
engaging
in
this
activity
is
in
no
wise
contrary
to
the
purposes
of
the
glass-steagall
act.
they’re
very
well
known.
they
were
first
to
prevent
a
bank
from
risking
its
own
assets
in
securities,
especially
speculative
securities
and
of
course
the
bank
has
no
assets
at
risk
here.
second,
they
were
intended
to
prevent
banks
from
investing
in
securities
and
then
endangering
their
solvency
by
making
loans
to
bail
out
that
investment.
and
since
the
bank
has
nothing
at
risk
here,
that
temptation
doesn’t
exist.
and
third,
the
glass-steagall
act
was
attended
to
prevent
banks
from
acquiring
issues
of
securities
and
then
putting
pressure
on
its
correspondents
and
on
its
customers
and
their
customers
in
order
to
sell
the
securities
in
which
it’s
invested
without
loss
so
as
to
make
its
middleman’s
profit,
and
of
course
there
is
no
such
thing
involved
in
the
present
case.
third,
i
would
point
out
that
it
is
agreed
on
all
hands
that
the
glass-steagall
act
does
not
apply
in
words
or
policy
to
the
bank’s
managing
investments
and
securities
on
behalf
of
customers
in
any
other
fiduciary
capacity
and
every
reason
that
excludes
those
cases,
whether
a
reason
in
terms
of
words
or
reason
in
terms
of
the
policy
applies
equally
to
the
city
bank
plan.
fourth,
i
submit
that
petitioner’s
argument
is
wholly
technical.
it
rests
entirely
upon
form
of
the
concepts
adopted
to
comply
with
the
investment
company
act.
indeed,
i
think
it’s
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
the
petitioners
do
not
cite
a
single
substantive
objection
to
the
account
that
it
is
not
equally
applicable
to
all
the
other
fiduciary
activities
that
are
undertaken
pursuant
to
section
92
(a)
and
certainly
are
not
affected
by
glass-steagall.
and
finally,
i
would
urge
that
there’s
no
basis
at
all
for
the
petitioner's
major
premise
here.
the
assumption
that
activity
is
subject
to
the
investment
company
act
must
somehow
be
prohibited
the
banks
by
the
glass-steagall
act.
that
doesn’t
follow.
the
two
may,
and
indeed
we
urge
do
overlap.
as
judge
bazelon
said,
the
acts
have
different
policies.
they
deal
with
different
subject
and
nothing
in
either
suggest
the
ironic
conclusion
that
i
mentioned
before
lunch
that
a
bank
managed
commingled
investment
account
which
doesn't
violate
section
1621.
if
you
don’t
give
your
fiduciaries,
your
customers
the
benefit
of
the
investment
company
act
somehow
becomes
unlawful
when
you
do,
which
as
i
say
is
indeed
is
ironic.
now,
the
petitioner’s
argument
as
i
understand
it
reduces
itself
somewhat
to
a
syllogism
and
in
a
sense
i
think
mr.
vieth
assumed
a
large
part
of
the
answer
to
the
case
in
his
first
statement
during
the
argument
this
morning.
the
syllogism
is
the
bank
everybody
concedes
that
the
mutual
fund
engages
in
the
kind
of
activities
in
which
a
bank
cannot
engage
or
which
it
could
not
affiliated
under
the
glass-steagall
act.
minor
premise,
city
bank’s
account
is
engaged
in
the
same
activities
as
the
mutual
fund
and
then
the
conclusion
is
that
we
violate
the
glass-steagall
act.
now,
we
deny
both
the
major
and
the
minor
premise,
and
if
we’re
right
on
either
account,
then
we’re
right
in
our
conclusion.
the
first
place
we
do
not
concede
that
a
mutual
fund,
certainly
a
no
load
mutual
fund
is
engaged
in
activities
of
a
kind
with
which
a
bank
cannot
be
connected
under
the
glass-steagall
act.
the
petitioners
until
this
case
were
arguing
just
the
opposite,
and
i
think
the
logic
of
a
good
many
of
the
arguments
in
our
brief
is
that
they
were
right
the
first
time.
the
federal
reserve
board
has
ruled
to
the
contrary
in
the
case
of
the
ordinary
mutual
fund,
but
that
isn’t
the
end
of
the
matter
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
that
isn’t
the
reason
to
begin
the
decision
of
this
case
by
assuming
the
correctness
of
the
federal
reserve
board
conclusions,
instead
of
going
back
as
i’ve
tried
to
do
to
the
words
of
the
statute
and
to
its
basic
policy.
now
second,
even
if
the
ordinary
mutual
fund
is
engaged
in
the
kind
of
activities
with
which
a
bank
is
--
which
are
forbidden
to
a
bank
or
with
which
it
is
forbidden
to
be
connected.
still
we
say
that
the
city
bank’s
account
is
not
in
violation
of
the
glass-steagall
act
because
we
think
it’s
a
markedly
different
situation
from
the
ordinary
mutual
fund.
in
some
of
the
banks,
indeed
for
the
most
part,
for
the
purposes
of
the
investment
company
act
were
the
same,
just
as
for
many
purposes
if
i
can
be
personal
about
it.
i’m
the
same
as
any
other
teacher
or
professor,
but
for
the
purpose
of
appearing
before
the
court,
i’m
not,
and
so
here.
we
say
that
for
many
purposes,
what
we’re
doing
may
be
the
same
as
what
a
mutual
fund
is
doing,
but
for
the
purposes
of
glass-steagall,
it’s
not.
and
we
would
stress
four
important
differences.
first,
i’ve
mentioned
it
several
times,
the
direct
fiduciary
relationship
between
the
bank
and
its
customers
which
does
not
exist
in
the
case
of
the
shareholder
in
a
mutual
fund
and
the
managers
of
the
fund.
second
of
course,
the
bank
--
mr.
archibald
cox
some
of
them
are
in
the
form
of
trusts.
massachusetts
investor’s
trust
is
in
the
form
of
a
trust
and
in
those
cases
there
maybe
that
direct
fiduciary.
mr.
archibald
cox
it’s
not
--
there
isn’t
quite
the
same
individual
relationship
i
think
that
there
is
here
where
the
bank
has
the
relationship
of
principle
and
agent.
but
i
would
go
on
and
even
if
those
cases
had
answered
others.
here
of
course
every
thing
what
the
bank
does
is
subject
to
regulation
9
and
the
comptroller’s
supervision,
and
that
is
not
true
either
with
the
massachusetts
investor’s
trust
or
the
other
mutual
funds.
third,
it
must
be
remembered
that
95%
of
the
shares
in
mutual
funds
are
marketed
as
if
they
were
ordinary
securities
through
the
ordinary
channels
of
the
securities
business.
they
advertised
on
television
whereas
the
bank’s
just
seeking
of
new
accounts
in
this
area
is
strictly
limited.
and
fourth,
and
i
think
perhaps
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it
can
advertise
them
and
it
can
advertise
this
in
connection
with
the
trust
services
provided
it
also
meets
the
requirements
of
the
sec
which
makes
it
very
difficult
to
advertise
the
trust
services
with
the
commingled
fund
together.
mr.
archibald
cox
about
here
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
i
think
so.
mr.
archibald
cox
what
it
can
do
is
on
page
24a
in
reg.
9,
it
may
have
a
report.
a
full
report
should
be
furnished
upon
request
to
any
person
and
the
fact
that
the
availability
of
such
material
may
be
given
publicity
solely
in
connection
with
the
promotion
of
the
fiduciary
services
of
the
bank,
except
this
herein
provided,
the
bank
shall
not
advertise
or
publicized
its
collective
investment
funds,
it’s
down
toward
the
bottom
of
the
page.
so,
there
are
rather
strict
limitations,
except
for
this
initial
mailing
about
all
the
bank
has
done
as
i
understand
it
is
to
have
a
slip
that’s
available
at
the
desks
in
the
branch
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it
can
bring
people
into
the
bank
--
mr.
archibald
cox
then
it
can
mention
in
this
far,
that’s
true.
and
then
fourth
part
is
that
from
the
standpoint
of
the
glass-steagall
act
i
submit,
all
the
account’s
activities
are
the
banks
activities.
now,
this
is
important
as
i
see
it
not
only
in
terms
of
the
entity
theory
which
is
the
federal
reserve
board
said
meant
that
there
was
no
violation
of
sections
21
and
32.
i
guess
i
have
mixed,
20
and
32,
but
it
also
i
think
characterizes
all
the
bank’s
activities
because
what
it
means
in
a
nutshell
is
that
the
bank,
nor
any
officer
of
the
bank
neither
has
any
interest
in
the
distribution
of
the
securities
of
any
other
organization,
or
any
interests
in
the
ownership
of
the
securities
of
any
other
organization,
and
it
is
those
things
that
i
submit
were
really
what
the
glass-steagall
act
was
directed
against,
that
the
bank
doesn’t
have,
nor
does
any
officer
have
that
kind
of
interest.
in
conclusion,
i
would
simply
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
federal
reserve
board
explicitly
advised
the
congress
that
for
the
purposes
of
separating
commercial
banking
from
investment
banking,
it
was
speaking
of
the
glass-steagall
policy,
are
not
significantly
relevant
to
the
operations
of
the
kind
under
discussion.
we
submit
therefore
that
the
petitioners
have
failed
to
show
that
the
agencies
findings
are
so
ill-considered
or
arbitrary
or
foolish
that
the
court
should
set
them
aside
and
consequently
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
