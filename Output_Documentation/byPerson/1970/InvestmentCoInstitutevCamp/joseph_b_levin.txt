mr.
joseph
b.
levin
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
joseph
levin.
i
represent
the
national
association
of
securities
dealers
inc.
the
association
is
made
up
of
some
4400
members
who
are
engaged
in
the
securities
business
and
a
great
majority
of
them
sell
mutual
fund
shares.
at
issue
here
is
an
order
of
exemption
entered
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
under
the
investment
company
act
of
1940.
and
that
order
enabled
the
first
national
city
bank
to
go
into
the
mutual
fund
business.
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
the
commission
has
washed
its
hands
of
its
decision
in
this
case.
the
commission,
we
believe
for
the
first
time
in
its
history
has
refused
to
appear
in
support
of
the
commission
order.
furthermore,
the
commission
in
its
response
to
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
which
we
filed
stated,
there's
no
assurance
that
the
commission
would
reach
the
same
judgment
for
similar
matter
is
again
presented.
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
yes.
the
explanation
for
the
commission
position
appears
in
the
brief
of
the
united
states
as
amicus
curiae
on
page
3.
the
statement
there
is
that
only
two
of
the
members
of
the
commission
who
participated
in
this
case
remain
as
members
of
the
commission.
one
of
whom
supported
the
decision
and
one
of
whom
dissented.
the
three
subsequently
appointed
members
of
the
commission
are
not
prepared
to
take
any
position.
accordingly,
the
commission
expresses
no
position
on
the
merits
and
urges
neither
affirmance
nor
reversal
of
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
in
this
setting
with
the
agency
taking
the
position
that
it
does,
the
court
asserts
here
to
accept
this
agency
expertise
which
for
all
practical
purposes,
at
least
the
present
commission
has
disowned.
i
might
also
point
out
that
two
of
the
three
judges
in
the
court
of
appeals
relied
upon
administrative
expertise
in
reaching
their
decision.
the
third
judge
also
affirmed
the
order
of
the
commission,
did
consider
the
merits
of
the
case.
the
question
presented
involves
section
6(c)
and
section
10(c)
of
the
investment
company
act.
section
10(c)
provides
and
i
quote
that
“no
registered
investment
company
shall
have
a
majority
of
its
board
of
directors
consisting
of
persons
who
are
officers
or
directors
of
one
bank.”
as
i
shall
more
fully
develop
later,
this
was
a
prophylaxis
described
to
deal
with
the
conflicts
of
interest
problem
resulting
from
the
investment
company
commercial
bank
interlock.
and
the
prophylaxis
resulted
from
a
record
of
gross
abuse
in
the
relationship.
here,
the
bank
has
created
an
investment
company
which
it
operates
and
manages
and
as
the
commission
acknowledged,
there
are
potential
conflicts
of
interest
between
the
bank
and
its
commercial
banking
activities
and
the
investment
company.
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
no.
well,
it’s
an
investment
company.
under
the
investment
company
act,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
is
an
investment
company
act
is
not
raised
in
this
litigation.
in
fact,
the
particular
account
has
registered
under
the
investment
company
act
as
an
open-ended
investment
company.
the
question
presented
here
is
whether
in
these
circumstances
that
is
where
there
are
potential
conflicts
of
interest.
the
commission
may
grant
the
bank
an
exemption
from
10(c)
by
invoking
section
6(c)
of
the
act.
section
6(c)
permits
the
commission
to
grant
an
exemption
from
any
provision
of
the
statute
and
i
quote
“if
into
the
extent
that
such
exemption
is
necessary
or
appropriate
in
the
public
interest
and
consistent
with
the
protection
of
investors
and
the
purpose
is
fairly
intended
by
the
policies
and
provisions
of
this
title.”
before
considering
the
policy
of
the
statute,
its
provisions,
i’d
very
briefly
like
to
describe
this
particular
investment
company
which
is
called
a
commingled
investment
account.
at
the
time
of
the
sec
proceedings,
the
account
had
not
yet
come
into
being.
it
has
now
come
into
being.
the
account
as
i've
said
is
registered
under
the
investment
company
as
an
open-end
investment
company.
its
objectives
are
the
investments
in
common
stock
and
convertibles
which
offer
the
opportunity
for
long-term
growth
of
capital
and
income,
a
prospect
offered
generally
by
investment
companies.
it
is
an
open-ended
investment
company
or
a
mutual
fund
because
it
stands
ready
to
redeem
its
shares
at
net
asset
value
and
it
makes
a
continuing
offering
on
that
basis.
the
participations
in
this
particular
mutual
fund
are
called
units
and
the
minimum
initial
participation
is
$10,000.00.
there
is
no
sales
charged
when
an
investor
buys
in
to
the
fund
and
in
that
respect,
the
fund
is
like
the
no
load
sales
--
no
load
investment
company.
the
account
uses
an
arrangement
common
to
mutual
funds.
it
is
managed
by
an
investment
adviser.
in
this
case,
the
bank
serves
that
function.
the
bank
maintains
a
continuous
investment
program
for
the
account.
it
determines
what
securities
are
to
be
bought
and
sold
and
executes
those
transactions.
for
its
services,
the
bank
receives
an
annual
fee
equal
to
one
half
of
1%
of
the
average
net
asset
value
of
the
account.
this
is
a
type
and
amount
of
fee
that’s
customary
in
the
mutual
fund
business.
operation
of
the
account
is
subject
to
the
supervision
of
a
committee
which
is
annually
elected
by
the
participants.
this
committee
is
--
under
the
statute
is
the
equivalent
of
the
board
of
directors.
and
it
was
this
board
of
directors
for
which
the
commission
granted
the
exemption
from
section
10(c)
with
one
commissioner
dissenting
as
i've
indicated.
the
board
has
five
members,
three
of
whom
are
officers
of
the
bank.
the
account
is
subject
to
the
supervision
of
the
comptroller
of
the
currency.
this
particular
type
of
operation
did
not
become
permissible
until
the
comptroller
adopted
certain
regulations
in
1963
and
validity
of
those
regulations
is
the
subject
of
number
61
which
is
to
be
argued
after
this
case.
now,
as
far
as
section
6(c)
of
the
act
is
concerned,
it
was
intended
for
persons
who
were
not
within
the
intendment
of
the
legislation.
now,
the
commission
in
its
decision
here
referred
to
its
traditional
standards
and
that
it
relies
upon
in
invoking
section
6(c).
and
as
the
commission
put
it,
the
propriety
of
granting
an
exemption
largely
depends
upon
the
purposes
of
the
section
from
which
an
exemption
is
requested,
the
evils
against
which
it
is
directed
and
the
end
which
it
seeks
to
accomplish.
and
then
it
continued
with
saying
that
the
showing
required
in
order
to
meet
the
standards
set
forth
in
section
6(c),
as
the
compliance
from
which
exemption
is
sought
is
not
necessary
to
accomplish
the
acts’
objectives
and
policies.
our
position
here
is
that
the
action
of
the
commission
does
contravene
the
policy
and
objectives
of
the
statute.
the
investment
company
act
resulted
from
a
comprehensive
study
of
investment
companies
which
the
commission
made
and
the
commission
itself
initiated
the
legislation.
that
study
revealed
--
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
i
think
that’s
correct.
i
think
the
--
in
this
case
the
--
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
i
believe
so.
in
order
to
--
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
that’s
right.
in
order
to
operate
this
mutual
fund,
the
regulations
of
the
comptroller
would
have
to
be
sustained
under
the
banking
act
of
1933
--
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
--
and
the
order
of
the
commission
--
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
well,
the
--
which
--
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
well
the
--
which
comes
first
here.
let
me
answer
it
this
way.
the
matter
was
presented
to
the
commission
in
the
first
instance
on
an
application
for
this
exemption.
the
commission
acted
it.
the
commission
in
its
opinion
assumed
that
there
was
compliance
with
the
glass-steagall
act.
it
didn’t
consider
the
issues.
and
then
subsequently,
an
action
was
initiated
in
the
district
court
challenging
the
validity
of
the
comptroller’s
regulations.
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
yes.
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
this
study
that
the
sec
conducted
which
led
to
the
passage
of
the
investment
company
act
revealed
a
history
of
abuse
on
the
part
of
insiders.
and
a
paramount
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
treat
with
the
conflicts
of
interest
problem
particularly
as
it
relates
to
investment
company
officers
and
directors
and
their
affiliates.
section
10(c)
is
part
of
the
statutory
arsenal
that
is
directed
at
that
conflicts
problem.
to
contend
with
the
conflicts
problem,
the
statute
contains
a
variety
of
provisions.
it
prohibits
self-dealing
by
insiders
in
very,
very
broad
terms.
it
restricts
agency
transactions
by
insiders.
it
imposes
fiduciary
obligations
on
investment
company
managements.
it
provides
for
pervasive
supervision
by
the
commission
of
investment
companies.
in
that
respect,
it
provides
for
periodic
examinations
by
the
commission
of
investment
companies,
for
detailed
filings
by
investment
companies
with
respect
to
their
operations
and
things
of
that
nature.
and
lastly,
it
also
provides
for
civil
and
criminal
enforcement
measures.
but
the
statute
went
one
step
further
in
terms
of
dealing
with
the
conflicts
of
interest
problem
and
felt
that
the
imposition
of
fiduciary
duties,
prohibition
of
self
dealing
and
commission
supervision
and
inspection
was
not
enough.
in
section
10,
which
the
commission
has
described
as
a
keystone
provision
of
a
statute
and
which
during
the
congressional
hearings
on
the
legislation
was
referred
to
as
a
double
barrel
protection.
the
statute
rather
imposes
certain
restrictions
on
the
composition
of
the
board
of
directors
of
an
investment
company.
apart
from
the
restriction
on
commercial
bankers
in
section
10(c),
it
also
places
restriction
on
membership
by
investment
bankers,
by
the
investment
company’s
principal
underwriter,
by
its
regular
broker,
by
its
investment
advisor,
and
by
people
that
are
affiliated
with
it.
now
turning
specifically
to
section
10(c),
to
use
the
language
of
one
of
the
commission's
spokesman
during
the
congressional
hearings,
it
was
the
consequence
of
horrible
examples
of
abuse
in
the
bank
dominated
investment
company.
the
legislative
history
which
is
fully
set
forth
in
our
brief
bristles
with
passages
that
condemn
that
particular
interlock.
for
example,
commission
spokesman
in
justifying
the
provisions
of
section
10(c)
during
the
course
of
the
congressional
hearings
made
the
following
observations.
there
were
very
undesirable
consequences
flowing
from
the
relationship.
some
worst
examples
of
abuses,
we
had
in
the
whole
study
arose
out
of
that
relationship.
the
conflicts
problem
becomes
more
acute
in
the
case
of
the
commercial
bank.
the
public’s
funds
are
used
to
further
the
banking
business
of
the
insider.
the
congressional
concern
as
it
was
expressed
in
the
senate
report
that
accompanied
the
legislation,
was
the
concern
with
the
unscrupulous
banks
who
advanced
their
own
pecuniary
interest
at
the
expense
of
investment
companies
and
their
security
holders.
indeed,
the
question
in
1940
was
not
how
little
but
rather
how
much
should
be
done
to
restrict
the
bank
interlock
and
indeed
whether
it
should
be
permitted
at
all.
and
that
section
10(c)
was
viewed
as
a
minimum
safeguard
for
there
were
those
who
advocated
the
complete
segregation
of
commercial
banks
from
investment
companies.
for
that
matter,
that
position
was
even
advocated
by
commercial
bankers
themselves
in
light
of
their
unhappy
experiences
during
the
20’s
in
terms
of
conflicts
in
the
operations
of
bank
sponsored
investment
companies.
and
particularly
significant
in
this
regard
is
the
observation
of
senator
robert
wagner
who
is
chairman
of
the
senate
banking
and
currency
committee
after
the
commission
had
put
in
its
testimony,
he
made
the
observation.
i
think
it
would
be
better
if
the
board
were
free
of
any
kind
of
influence
from
bankers.
of
course,
i
know
that
is
ideal
and
that
we
are
not
going
to
get
that
far.
but
then
there
would
be
no
chance
about
their
loyalty
being
consciously
or
subconsciously
only
to
their
investment
trust
rather
than
to
outside
interests.
the
commission
explained
10(c)
in
saying
that
it
viewed
10(c)
as
a
middle
of
the
road
approach
--
as
a
compromise.
it
was
put
as
instead
of
having
complete
segregation
of
commercial
bankers,
an
attempt
was
made
to
permit
it
and
then
just
circumscribe
it.
the
statutory
concern
with
bank
domination
of
investment
companies
is
not
only
limited
to
section
10(c)
but
it’s
further
manifested
in
section
10
(h)
(2)
of
the
act.
that
section
deals
with
the
type
of
investment
company
that
does
not
have
a
board
of
directors.
section
10
(h)
(2)
provides
that
the
investment
advisor
to
such
a
company
must
satisfy
the
standards
of
section
10(c).
a
bank
thus
could
not
be
an
investment
advisor
to
one
of
these
companies
that
does
not
have
a
board
of
directors.
in
other
words,
under
the
statute,
a
bank
may
only
serve
as
an
investment
advisor,
if
there's
a
buffer
of
board
of
directors
meeting
the
provisions
of
section
10(c).
in
our
view,
it
is
unmistakable
that
section
10(c)
was
intended
as
a
minimum
invest
to
protection
certainly
where
there
are
potential
conflicts
of
interest
and
now
turning
to
the
matter
of
the
conflicts
of
interest
that
exist
in
this
situation.
as
i've
indicated,
the
commission
acknowledged
that
there
are
potential
conflicts
of
interest
here
which
could
arise
as
a
result
of
the
bank’s
commercial
banking
business.
in
fact,
one
of
the
spokesmen
for
the
banking
industry
recently
in
urging
the
amendment
of
section
10,
acknowledged
the
fact
that
the
conflicts
problem
is
inherent
in
the
relationship.
and
in
a
situation
such
as
is
involved
here
where
the
bank
has
control
of
the
day-to-day
management
of
the
investment
company
where
the
free
reign
in
the
conduct
of
its
operations,
a
conflicts
problem
emerges
probably
as
sharply
as
it
ever
could.
the
only
aspects
of
the
problem
of
the
conflicts
problem
to
which
the
sec
addressed
itself
were
those
that
it
itself
had
referred
to,
in
1963
in
urging
that
the
section
10
prophylaxis
was
necessary
for
the
type
of
arrangement
that’s
involved
in
this
commingled
agency
account.
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
the
commission--
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
well,
the
commission
has
authority
under
the
statute
to
exempt
from
any
provision
of
the
statute
but
in
exercising
that,
it
must
bear
in
mind
these
statutory
policy
and
objectives.
it
cannot
order
--
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
or
in
abusing
the
discretion,
it
exceeded
its
authority
under
the
statute.
in
other
words,
the
issue
as
its
posited
here
is
whether
the
commission
in
the
circumstances
where
there
are
potential
conflicts
of
interest
may
consist
with
the
public
interest
policy
of
the
statute
granted
exemption.
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
that’s
right.
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
whether
or
not
it
may
have
--
whether
or
not
it
may
have
majority
control
of
that
board
of
directors
and
it
was
at
that
line
--
it
was
at
that
line
that
the
congress
drew
the
line
of
prophylaxis.
it
said
“you
may
have
to
--
out
of
a
board
of
five,
you
may
have
as
many
as
two
but
as
a
matter
of
prophylaxis,
as
a
matter
of
policy,
you
may
not
have
three.”
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
no.
a
word
about
the
structure
of
the
statute.
the
statute
grants
the
commission
considerable
flexibility
in
many
areas
of
the
statute.
it
permits
the
commission
to
exempt.
it
permits
the
commission
to
grant
various
types
of
orders
necessary
in
the
public
interest
and
things
of
that
nature.
however,
it
withheld
or
the
statute
withholds
that
type
of
specific
statutory
authority
--
exemptive
authority
or
molding
authority
in
section
10(c).
and
in
fact,
the
legislative
hearing
show
that
it
was
intended
in
section
10
not
to
provide
flexibility.
what
we
have
here
though
is
a
residual
authority
that
the
congress
granted
in
section
6(c).
in
that
authority,
the
congress
said
if
you
--
if
there
is
a
situation
that
isn’t
within
the
intent
of
the
legislation,
it
isn’t
the
kind
of
situation
in
which
the
evils
of
the
statute
are
directed,
doesn’t
fall
within
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
in
those
circumstances,
you
may
grant
an
exemption.
as
i
say,
the
only
aspects
of
the
problem
to
which
the
commission
addressed
itself
were
those
conflicts
that
in
itself
had
emphasized,
in
1963
congressional
hearings
in
urging
that
the
section
10
prophylaxis
was
necessary
for
the
type
of
arrangement
that
are
here
presented.
and
the
conflicts
which
the
commission
referred
to
and
they
are
four
in
number,
is
the
danger
that
the
bank
might
retain
an
unwarranted
portion
of
the
assets
of
the
bank
sponsored
fund
in
cash
in
order
to
earn
money
for
the
bank.
secondly,
that
banks
distribute
brokerage
according
to
a
formula
which
rewards
those
brokerage
who
keep
balances
in
the
bank
or
have
other
dealings
with
the
bank.
this
policy,
the
commission
pointed
out
in
’63
could
lead
to
excessive
portfolio
turnover
or
to
a
fund
not
receiving
maximum
benefit
from
its
brokerage
business.
thirdly,
that
fund
investments
could
be
used
to
shore
up
bank
loans
and
fourthly,
that
bankers
or
underwriters
and
dealers
and
various
kinds
of
government
bonds
that
they
might
use
the
fund
as
a
place
to
place
those
bonds.
now,
these
aren’t
the
only
conflicts
of
interest.
these
are
the
ones
that
the
commission
addressed
itself
to,
there
are
others.
for
example,
a
bank
may
use
the
investment
company
as
a
bird
hock
(ph)
that
is
it
may
have
the
fund
make
an
investment
in
the
company
in
the
hopes
or
in
order
to
get
the
commercial
banking
business
of
the
particular
company.
there's
also
a
companion
problem.
the
nature
of
which
was
alluded
to
in
the
congressional
hearings.
the
situation
of
where
a
fund
holds
securities
of
a
company
which
is
an
important
commercial
banking
customer.
and
the
sale
would
appear
to
be
advisable
but
the
sale
would
depress
the
market
price,
something
that
the
company
managements
don’t
like.
the
question
is
whether
in
those
circumstances,
the
bank
would
be
able
or
the
bank
directors
would
be
able
to
look
at
the
matter
of
the
disposition
of
that
investment
with
an
eye
singled
to
the
interest
of
the
fund
or
would
his
thinking
be
concerned
by
the
impact
on
the
commercial
banking
customer.
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
the
6(c)
power?
yes.
the
6(c)
power
is
exercised
frequently
by
the
commission.
the
matter
of
the
commission’s
authority
under
6(c)
i
don’t
believe
has
ever
really
been
considered
by
a
court
and
the
6(c)
orders
ordinarily
come
up
in
the
context
of
where
there
is
no
opposition
to
the
grant
of
the
exemption
so
that
the
6(c)
grant
--
it
becomes
pretty
much
a
formal
matter.
there
are
cases
though
where
there
is
opposition.
but
as
i
say
relatively,
they
are
rare
situations.
the
matter
becomes
one
between
the
staff
of
the
commission
and
the
applicant
and
if
the
commission
is
willing
to
grant
the
order,
the
applicant
of
course
is
very
happy
and
there
isn’t
anybody
to
challenge.
and
that’s
why
there's
very
little
opposition.
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
pardon?
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
yes.
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
evidentiary
hearing
before
the
commission.
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
there
was
oral
argument
and
briefs.
we
took
the
position
before
the
commission
that
the
bank’s
application
did
not
make
out
either
a
factual
or
legal
basis
on
which
to
grant
the
exemption,
we
didn’t
feel
that
we
ought
to
be
asking
for
an
evidentiary
hearing.
we
thought
that
the
burden
was
on
the
bank
to
show
that
it
--
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
that’s
the
applicant
for
the
exemption.
and
in
fact,
the
only
ground
that
the
bank
advanced
in
its
application
was
the
fact
that
unless
it
got
this
exemption,
it
wouldn’t
be
able
to
go
forward
in
this
particular
mutual
fund
business
.now,
the
overall
problem
that’s
presented
here
in
terms
of
conflicts
was
probably
as
well
presented
as
possible
by
one
of
the
commissioners
in
this
case
during
the
course
of
oral
argument.
and
i
might
add
it
was
not
the
commissioner
who
dissented
who
observed
that
the
bank’s
application
presented
as
he
put
it
in
a
very
exaggerated
or
extreme
form.
the
problem
of
the
old
matter
of
joint
ventures
of
seeming
joint
ventures
where
the
bank
on
the
one
hand
in
the
exercise
of
its
various
functions
has
relationship
with
the
company
and
your
account
for
various
reasons
also
has
relationships
with
the
company.
and
who
is
to
say
where
the
propriety
line
should
be
drawn
and
is
drawn?
and
bank
counsel's
response
at
that
point
was
that
he
acknowledged
the
problem
and
he
said
that
the
bank
would
have
to
liquidate.
finally,
as
the
dissenting
commissioner
pointed
out
in
the
exact
form
of
future
conflicts
be
anticipated.
in
these
circumstances,
we
submit
there
is
presently
evil
to
which
section
10(c)
is
directed
namely
potential
conflicts
of
interest.
and
by
the
sec’s
own
standards
for
the
application
of
section
6(c),
an
exemption
is
therefore
improper.
now,
the
commission
did
attempt
to
rationalize
an
exemption.
and
we
submit
of
course,
that
the
analysis
is
erroneous.
first
and
what
is
an
unusual
stance
for
the
commission
in
administering
this
remedial
statute.
the
commission
endeavored
to
restrict
the
intent
and
scope
of
the
statutes.
although
the
statute
speaks
in
terms
of
no
registered
investment
company,
the
commission
said
congress
really
didn’t
mean
it.
and
in
this
regard
--
it
also
pointed
out
that
this
account
did
not
become
permissible
until
1963
with
the
new
comptroller's
regulation.
and
in
terms
of
endeavoring
to
find
a
basis
to
distinguish
it
--
this
particular
fund,
it
said
that
the
fund
was
different
from
the
bank
dominated
investment
companies
that
were
described
in
the
commission's
study.
now
as
far
as
the
account
not
becoming
permissible
until
1963,
i
submit
that
that’s
irrelevant.
in
the
account’s
pursed
after
1940
doesn’t
negate
the
potentials
for
conflict
and
that’s
what
is
the
statute’s
concern
under
section
10(c).
insofar
as
the
commission
looked
to
the
bank
affiliates
of
the
20’s
and
tried
to
find
identity,
the
commission’s
own
study
in
describing
these
bank
affiliate
says
and
i
quote
that
“these
affiliates
acted
as
investment
companies
in
buying
and
selling
securities
for
an
investment
for
speculative
purposes.”
it
was
for
this
reason
that
section
10(c)
was
enacted
and
it
is
precisely
this
function
that
the
account
or
this
bank
sponsor
mutual
fund
will
engage
in.
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
furthermore
--
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
that’s
right
and
what
i
am
saying
is
that
one
of
the
functions
of
those
bank
securities
affiliates
in
the
20’s
as
described
in
the
commission
study
was
that
those
affiliates
among
other
things
engaged
in
the
business
of
buying
and
selling
securities
for
investment
or
speculative
purposes
and
it
was
because
they
engaged
in
that
particular
activity
in
the
investment
company
business
that
they
became
subject
to
the
investment
company
act
and
section
10(c)
was
adopted.
in
any
event,
the
statute
itself
patently
rejects
this
commission
approach
that
the
application
of
section
10(c)
turns
on
whether
a
particular
company
has
a
kinship
to
the
bank
affiliates
of
the
1920’s.
and
i
refer
specifically
to
section
10(d)
of
the
investment
company
act.
10(d)
deals
with
the
so-called
no
load
companies
that
are
managed
by
investment
counselors.
now,
those
companies
at
a
special
situation,
those
companies
are
granted
the
matter
of
exemptions
from
section
10.
it
was
considered
for
those
companies.
these
are
open-end
companies.
a
matter
of
exemptions
for
those
companies
was
specifically
considered.
they
were
granted
certain
exemptions
from
10(a)
and
from
10(b),
the
companies
have
no
kinship
to
the
bank
securities
affiliates
of
the
1920’s
but
congress
specifically
withheld
an
exemption
from
10(c).
and
it’s
particularly
interesting
that
in
so
called
10(d)
company,
the
no
load
company,
there
is
less
of
a
chance
of
the
potential
conflicts
of
interest
because
by
hypothesis,
those
companies
cannot
be
managed
by
banks.
furthermore,
the
broad
provision
of
section
10(c)
is
such
that
it
reaches
to
all
types
of
investment
companies
for
example,
i
referred
already
to
the
so
called
10
(h)
(2)
company.
the
company
that
doesn’t
have
a
board
of
directors.
congress
said
we
want
10(c)
to
apply
there
where
it
can
and
furthermore
it
applies
to
face
amounts
of
certificate
companies
which
had
absolutely
no
kinship
or
identity
with
the
bank
security
affiliates
of
the
1920’s.
now,
the
commission
did
attempt
to
come
to
grips
with
the
conflicts
problem
and
what
it
said
was
that
there
were
substantial
safeguards
here
against
conflicts.
that’s
its
characterization
substantial
conflicts.
and
we
submit
that
that
doesn’t
answer
the
statutory
question.
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
by
the
comptroller
and
also
the
self
dealing
prohibitions
in
the
investment
company
act
and
in
the
comptroller
regulations.
basically,
the
comptroller’s
regulations
really
don’t
add
anything
to
what
the
investment
company
act
provides.
the
commission
in
its
opinion
here
in
referring
to
the
substantial
safeguards
made
reference
in
the
first
instance
of
the
comptroller’s
regulations
to
the
inspections
of
the
comptroller.
the
fact
is
--
and
the
commission
made
no
reference
to
it
that
it
has
inspection
authorities
of
investment
companies
and
as
the
commissioner
who
is
the
spokesman
for
the
commission
during
the
legislative
hearings
pointed
out,
the
purpose
of
that
inspection
authority
was
to
permit
the
commission
to
engage
in
the
same
kind
of
inspections
as
were
permitted
for
the
comptroller
under
the
bank.
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
well,
on
that
one,
the
commission
imposed
a
further
condition
that
goes
beyond
the
statute.
and
the
commission
found
that
it
saw
no
likelihood
that
there
would
be
any
overreaching
by
the
bank
--
qua-investment
banker.
and
i
might
add
in
that
regard
that
the
commission
was
very
careful
to
refrain
from
making
that
same
observation
about
the
bank
and
its
capacity
as
to
whether
--
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
pardon?
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
there
is
a
condition
that
was
added
in
terms
of
the
underwriting
or
underwritings
by
the
bank.
turning
back
to
the
matter
of
the
supervision
of
the
comptroller,
as
i
say
the
statute
granted
the
commission
the
authority
to
inspect
investment
companies.
as
i've
indicated
earlier,
the
statute
authorized
the
commission
while
the
statute
prohibits
itself
dealing
imposes
fiduciary
obligations.
and
nevertheless,
it
imposed
there's
a
prophylaxis,
this
10(c)
requirement.
now
the
fact
that
--
we
submit
the
fact
that
there
may
also
be
regulation
or
inspections
by
the
comptroller,
inspections
as
far
as
the
statute
is
concerned
that
are
no
broader
than
the
commission
is
empowered
to
make
under
the
investment
company
act
is
no
reason
to
deny
investors
in
this
mutual
fund
the
specific
10(c)
prophylaxis
against
domination
by
a
bank
investment
company.
the
congress
thought
that
inspection
or
government
oversight
was
enough.
it
was
already
in
the
investment
company
act.
that
didn’t
have
to
provide
for
10(c).
i’ll
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
mr.
justice
black
may
it
please
the
court.
i
wanted
to
clarify
a
response
that
i
gave
yesterday
in
connection
with
the
question
that
mr.
justice
harlan
directed
with
respect
to
the
commission's
use
of
section
6(c).
i
said
that
exempt
of
authority
was
used
frequently
and
it
is.
but
i
did
not
mean
that
it
was
used
frequently
in
connection
with
section
10(c).
the
commission
has
used
section
6(c)
in
two
cases
both
on
the
same
day
back
in
1959
in
an
opposed
order
and
there
was
no
opinion
but
the
--
in
those
cases
in
one
of
them
--
all
of
the
stock
of
the
investment
company
and
it
was
not
an
open-ended
investment
company
regarding
variety
of
investment
company
of
the
kind
that
we
have
in
this
situation.
but
rather
a
small
business
investment
company.
it’s
a
special
arrangement
designed
to
facilitate
loans
to
small
business
concerns.
in
one
of
the
cases
all
of
the
stock
of
the
small
business
investment
company
was
owned
by
the
bank
itself.
in
the
other
case,
the
stock
was
owned
by
the
bank
and
by
a
trustee
for
the
benefit
of
stockholders
and
in
the
recitals
in
those
particular
orders.
in
both
orders,
there’s
the
same
recital.
and
the
recital
is
that
the
applicant
investment
company
believes
that
it’s
entitled
to
the
exemption
and
i
quote,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
public
investor
interest
in
applicant
investment
company
is
confined
to
the
shareholders
of
the
bank.
so
that
there
we
have
the
very
much
different
situation
than
we
have
here
because
you
don’t
have
the
potential
conflicts
of
interest
between
the
bank
and
the
investment
company.
now,
in
terms
of
the
scope
of
the
statute,
i
simply
want
to
make
it
clear
that
the
type
of
relationship,
the
commingled
agency
account
is
a
relationship
that
is
very
specifically
reached
by
the
statute.
the
legislative
history
refers
to
the
situation
of
the
commingled
agency
account.
it’s
not
a
bank
sponsored
account.
but
there
was
a
situation
specifically
referred
to
in
the
legislative
history
of
where
certain
people
had
deposited
money
on
an
agency
basis
with
an
individual
and
that
individual
managed
the
money.
he
pooled
it.
and
the
legislative
history
treats
that
particular
commingled
managed
agency
account
as
an
investment
company.
indeed,
the
commission
in
its
report
to
the
congress
in
the
first
volume
of
the
investment
trust
study
in
part
one
at
page
24
in
talking
of
the
types
of
relationships
that
give
rise
to
the
investment
company
refers
to
the
corporate
form,
to
the
massachusetts
trust,
to
the
joint
stock
company
and
lastly
to
the
agency
relationship.
and
i
want
to
quote
from
that
report
“it’s
a
brief
passage
which
indicates
what
the
commission
was
thinking
about.”
another
distinctive
form
of
organization
of
investment
companies
involves
an
agency
relationship
between
the
individual
contributors
to
the
fund
and
the
management
upon
whom
they
confer
substantially
a
power
of
attorney
to
act
as
agent
in
the
investment
of
the
monies
contributed.
the
group
of
individuals
is
not
a
legal
entity
but
rather
constitutes
in
essence
the
combination
of
distinct
individual
interest.
now,
the
problem
of
the
commingled
account
and
as
i
say
not
in
terms
of
the
bank
but
the
general
concept
of
the
commingled
account
is
considered
in
considerable
detail
in
the
commission's
opinion
in
the
prudential
case
which
was
affirmed
by
the
third
circuit,
the
citation
is
in
our
brief.
and
there’s
a
full
exploration
of
that
particular
aspect
of
the
investment
company
act.
now,
with
respect
to
the
exemption
for
the
common
trust
fund
that’s
been
referred
to
here.
the
commission
itself
in
this
very
prudential
case
that
i
just
referred
to
indeed
in
the
third
circuit
adopted
the
very
language
of
the
commission.
the
commission
said
the
following,
it
referring
to
the
congress
rested
this
exemption
on
the
special
considerations
that
the
funds
were
used
for
bonafide
the
fiduciary
purposes
rather
than
as
a
medium
for
general
public
investment
and
had
only
a
limited
impact
in
the
investment
fund
picture.
and
that
the
commission
did
prepare
as
part
of
this
investment
trust
study,
did
prepare
a
special
small
volume,
pamphlet
dealing
with
the
matter
of
the
common
trust
fund.
now,
point
number
one,
the
commission
did
not
make
an
extensive
study
of
the
common
trust
fund.
one
of
the
--
investigating
to
the
matter
of
the
abuses
that
were
involved
in
the
operation
of
the
common
trust
fund
--
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
that’s
right.
and
the
commission
pointed
out
and
one
of
the
reasons
for
it
was
is
that
at
time,
they
were
all
tools
and
16
common
trust
funds
in
the
country.
and
in
the
aggregate
they
represented
that
i
believe
about
$36
million.
there
was
nothing
of
consequence
in
terms
of
the
common
trust
fund.
and
the
commission
pointed
out
in
that
report
that
the
participation
in
the
fund
and
i’m
quoting
now
“in
the
common
trust
fund
is
not
available
to
the
general
public.”
and
indeed,
the
commission
at
that
time
in
providing
the
exemption
for
the
common
trust
fund
had
before
it,
the
regulations
of
the
federal
reserve
board
with
reference
to
common
trust
funds
and
one
of
the
specific
provisions
in
the
regulations
of
the
common
trust
fund
at
that
time
and
these
appear
in
the
appendix
to
the
commission’s
study
on
the
commingled
trust
account.
the
regulations
refer
to
the
fact
that
the
common
trust
fund
means
a
fund
maintained
by
a
national
bank
exclusively
for
the
collective
investment
and
reinvestment
of
monies
contributed
thereto
by
the
bank
in
its
capacity,
its
trustee,
executor,
administrator,
or
guardian.
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
and
this
is
of
particular
significance.
the
purpose
of
this
section
is
to
permit
the
use
of
common
trust
funds
as
defined
in
section
169
of
the
revenue
act
of
1936,
for
the
investment
of
funds
held
by
true
fiduciary
purposes.
and
then
it
goes
on
and
the
operation
of
such
common
trust
funds
as
investment
trusts
for
other
than
strictly
fiduciary
purposes
is
forbidden.
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
well,
the
federal
reserve
board
prior
to
1963
when
it
administered
the
regulations
with
respect
to
the
common
trust
fund
said
that
you
could
not
use
for
common
trust
fund
by
the
device
of
an
inter-vivos
trust
for
the
--
or
to
get
a
participation
in
this
common
trust
when
you
couldn’t
use
it
as
a
means
in
effect
for
public
participation
in
a
pool
of
securities.
you
couldn’t
use
it
for
the
very
purpose
that
it
is
being
--
that
the
commingled
account
is
being
used.
in
other
words
--
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
it
could
not
be
used.
i’d
rather
put
it
this
way
that
the
common
trust
fund
could
not
be
used
as
means
for
soliciting
public
participation
in
the
pool
of
securities
for
public
investment
through
the
guys
of
an
inter-vivos
trust.
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
he
could
use
the
trust
relationship,
create
the
trust
but
as
i
say
in
terms
of
the
scope
of
the
regulation
as
it
was
administered
by
the
federal
reserve
board
was
that
the
trust
relationship
was
not
to
be
used
as
it
is
being
used
here.
actually,
it
isn’t
a
trust
relationship.
it’s
called
a
commingled
account
where
in
effect
you
go
out
and
create
a
common
package
of
securities
for
all
commerce
to
come
in
and
make
an
investment
in
what
is
a
mutual
fund.
and
the
federal
reserve
board
as
it
administered
the
common
trust
fund
provision
that
said
if
you
do
have
an
individualized
relationship,
the
kind
of
thing
that
you
have
in
a
trust
relationship
where
you
can
pool
it
but
you
cannot
go
up
and
create
an
investment
company
and
use
the
common
trust
fund
as
a
device
to
solicit
or
public
participations
which
is
precisely
what
is
being
created
here
and
it
is
for
that
very
reason
that
the
commission
had
said
that
it’s
subject
to
investment
company.
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
joseph
levin.
i
represent
the
national
association
of
securities
dealers
inc.
the
association
is
made
up
of
some
4400
members
who
are
engaged
in
the
securities
business
and
a
great
majority
of
them
sell
mutual
fund
shares.
at
issue
here
is
an
order
of
exemption
entered
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
under
the
investment
company
act
of
1940.
and
that
order
enabled
the
first
national
city
bank
to
go
into
the
mutual
fund
business.
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
the
commission
has
washed
its
hands
of
its
decision
in
this
case.
the
commission,
we
believe
for
the
first
time
in
its
history
has
refused
to
appear
in
support
of
the
commission
order.
furthermore,
the
commission
in
its
response
to
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
which
we
filed
stated,
there's
no
assurance
that
the
commission
would
reach
the
same
judgment
for
similar
matter
is
again
presented.
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
yes.
the
explanation
for
the
commission
position
appears
in
the
brief
of
the
united
states
as
amicus
curiae
on
page
3.
the
statement
there
is
that
only
two
of
the
members
of
the
commission
who
participated
in
this
case
remain
as
members
of
the
commission.
one
of
whom
supported
the
decision
and
one
of
whom
dissented.
the
three
subsequently
appointed
members
of
the
commission
are
not
prepared
to
take
any
position.
accordingly,
the
commission
expresses
no
position
on
the
merits
and
urges
neither
affirmance
nor
reversal
of
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
in
this
setting
with
the
agency
taking
the
position
that
it
does,
the
court
asserts
here
to
accept
this
agency
expertise
which
for
all
practical
purposes,
at
least
the
present
commission
has
disowned.
i
might
also
point
out
that
two
of
the
three
judges
in
the
court
of
appeals
relied
upon
administrative
expertise
in
reaching
their
decision.
the
third
judge
also
affirmed
the
order
of
the
commission,
did
consider
the
merits
of
the
case.
the
question
presented
involves
section
6(c)
and
section
10(c)
of
the
investment
company
act.
section
10(c)
provides
and
i
quote
that
“no
registered
investment
company
shall
have
a
majority
of
its
board
of
directors
consisting
of
persons
who
are
officers
or
directors
of
one
bank.”
as
i
shall
more
fully
develop
later,
this
was
a
prophylaxis
described
to
deal
with
the
conflicts
of
interest
problem
resulting
from
the
investment
company
commercial
bank
interlock.
and
the
prophylaxis
resulted
from
a
record
of
gross
abuse
in
the
relationship.
here,
the
bank
has
created
an
investment
company
which
it
operates
and
manages
and
as
the
commission
acknowledged,
there
are
potential
conflicts
of
interest
between
the
bank
and
its
commercial
banking
activities
and
the
investment
company.
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
no.
well,
it’s
an
investment
company.
under
the
investment
company
act,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
is
an
investment
company
act
is
not
raised
in
this
litigation.
in
fact,
the
particular
account
has
registered
under
the
investment
company
act
as
an
open-ended
investment
company.
the
question
presented
here
is
whether
in
these
circumstances
that
is
where
there
are
potential
conflicts
of
interest.
the
commission
may
grant
the
bank
an
exemption
from
10(c)
by
invoking
section
6(c)
of
the
act.
section
6(c)
permits
the
commission
to
grant
an
exemption
from
any
provision
of
the
statute
and
i
quote
“if
into
the
extent
that
such
exemption
is
necessary
or
appropriate
in
the
public
interest
and
consistent
with
the
protection
of
investors
and
the
purpose
is
fairly
intended
by
the
policies
and
provisions
of
this
title.”
before
considering
the
policy
of
the
statute,
its
provisions,
i’d
very
briefly
like
to
describe
this
particular
investment
company
which
is
called
a
commingled
investment
account.
at
the
time
of
the
sec
proceedings,
the
account
had
not
yet
come
into
being.
it
has
now
come
into
being.
the
account
as
i've
said
is
registered
under
the
investment
company
as
an
open-end
investment
company.
its
objectives
are
the
investments
in
common
stock
and
convertibles
which
offer
the
opportunity
for
long-term
growth
of
capital
and
income,
a
prospect
offered
generally
by
investment
companies.
it
is
an
open-ended
investment
company
or
a
mutual
fund
because
it
stands
ready
to
redeem
its
shares
at
net
asset
value
and
it
makes
a
continuing
offering
on
that
basis.
the
participations
in
this
particular
mutual
fund
are
called
units
and
the
minimum
initial
participation
is
$10,000.00.
there
is
no
sales
charged
when
an
investor
buys
in
to
the
fund
and
in
that
respect,
the
fund
is
like
the
no
load
sales
--
no
load
investment
company.
the
account
uses
an
arrangement
common
to
mutual
funds.
it
is
managed
by
an
investment
adviser.
in
this
case,
the
bank
serves
that
function.
the
bank
maintains
a
continuous
investment
program
for
the
account.
it
determines
what
securities
are
to
be
bought
and
sold
and
executes
those
transactions.
for
its
services,
the
bank
receives
an
annual
fee
equal
to
one
half
of
1%
of
the
average
net
asset
value
of
the
account.
this
is
a
type
and
amount
of
fee
that’s
customary
in
the
mutual
fund
business.
operation
of
the
account
is
subject
to
the
supervision
of
a
committee
which
is
annually
elected
by
the
participants.
this
committee
is
--
under
the
statute
is
the
equivalent
of
the
board
of
directors.
and
it
was
this
board
of
directors
for
which
the
commission
granted
the
exemption
from
section
10(c)
with
one
commissioner
dissenting
as
i've
indicated.
the
board
has
five
members,
three
of
whom
are
officers
of
the
bank.
the
account
is
subject
to
the
supervision
of
the
comptroller
of
the
currency.
this
particular
type
of
operation
did
not
become
permissible
until
the
comptroller
adopted
certain
regulations
in
1963
and
validity
of
those
regulations
is
the
subject
of
number
61
which
is
to
be
argued
after
this
case.
now,
as
far
as
section
6(c)
of
the
act
is
concerned,
it
was
intended
for
persons
who
were
not
within
the
intendment
of
the
legislation.
now,
the
commission
in
its
decision
here
referred
to
its
traditional
standards
and
that
it
relies
upon
in
invoking
section
6(c).
and
as
the
commission
put
it,
the
propriety
of
granting
an
exemption
largely
depends
upon
the
purposes
of
the
section
from
which
an
exemption
is
requested,
the
evils
against
which
it
is
directed
and
the
end
which
it
seeks
to
accomplish.
and
then
it
continued
with
saying
that
the
showing
required
in
order
to
meet
the
standards
set
forth
in
section
6(c),
as
the
compliance
from
which
exemption
is
sought
is
not
necessary
to
accomplish
the
acts’
objectives
and
policies.
our
position
here
is
that
the
action
of
the
commission
does
contravene
the
policy
and
objectives
of
the
statute.
the
investment
company
act
resulted
from
a
comprehensive
study
of
investment
companies
which
the
commission
made
and
the
commission
itself
initiated
the
legislation.
that
study
revealed
--
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
i
think
that’s
correct.
i
think
the
--
in
this
case
the
--
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
i
believe
so.
in
order
to
--
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
that’s
right.
in
order
to
operate
this
mutual
fund,
the
regulations
of
the
comptroller
would
have
to
be
sustained
under
the
banking
act
of
1933
--
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
--
and
the
order
of
the
commission
--
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
well,
the
--
which
--
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
well
the
--
which
comes
first
here.
let
me
answer
it
this
way.
the
matter
was
presented
to
the
commission
in
the
first
instance
on
an
application
for
this
exemption.
the
commission
acted
it.
the
commission
in
its
opinion
assumed
that
there
was
compliance
with
the
glass-steagall
act.
it
didn’t
consider
the
issues.
and
then
subsequently,
an
action
was
initiated
in
the
district
court
challenging
the
validity
of
the
comptroller’s
regulations.
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
yes.
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
this
study
that
the
sec
conducted
which
led
to
the
passage
of
the
investment
company
act
revealed
a
history
of
abuse
on
the
part
of
insiders.
and
a
paramount
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
treat
with
the
conflicts
of
interest
problem
particularly
as
it
relates
to
investment
company
officers
and
directors
and
their
affiliates.
section
10(c)
is
part
of
the
statutory
arsenal
that
is
directed
at
that
conflicts
problem.
to
contend
with
the
conflicts
problem,
the
statute
contains
a
variety
of
provisions.
it
prohibits
self-dealing
by
insiders
in
very,
very
broad
terms.
it
restricts
agency
transactions
by
insiders.
it
imposes
fiduciary
obligations
on
investment
company
managements.
it
provides
for
pervasive
supervision
by
the
commission
of
investment
companies.
in
that
respect,
it
provides
for
periodic
examinations
by
the
commission
of
investment
companies,
for
detailed
filings
by
investment
companies
with
respect
to
their
operations
and
things
of
that
nature.
and
lastly,
it
also
provides
for
civil
and
criminal
enforcement
measures.
but
the
statute
went
one
step
further
in
terms
of
dealing
with
the
conflicts
of
interest
problem
and
felt
that
the
imposition
of
fiduciary
duties,
prohibition
of
self
dealing
and
commission
supervision
and
inspection
was
not
enough.
in
section
10,
which
the
commission
has
described
as
a
keystone
provision
of
a
statute
and
which
during
the
congressional
hearings
on
the
legislation
was
referred
to
as
a
double
barrel
protection.
the
statute
rather
imposes
certain
restrictions
on
the
composition
of
the
board
of
directors
of
an
investment
company.
apart
from
the
restriction
on
commercial
bankers
in
section
10(c),
it
also
places
restriction
on
membership
by
investment
bankers,
by
the
investment
company’s
principal
underwriter,
by
its
regular
broker,
by
its
investment
advisor,
and
by
people
that
are
affiliated
with
it.
now
turning
specifically
to
section
10(c),
to
use
the
language
of
one
of
the
commission's
spokesman
during
the
congressional
hearings,
it
was
the
consequence
of
horrible
examples
of
abuse
in
the
bank
dominated
investment
company.
the
legislative
history
which
is
fully
set
forth
in
our
brief
bristles
with
passages
that
condemn
that
particular
interlock.
for
example,
commission
spokesman
in
justifying
the
provisions
of
section
10(c)
during
the
course
of
the
congressional
hearings
made
the
following
observations.
there
were
very
undesirable
consequences
flowing
from
the
relationship.
some
worst
examples
of
abuses,
we
had
in
the
whole
study
arose
out
of
that
relationship.
the
conflicts
problem
becomes
more
acute
in
the
case
of
the
commercial
bank.
the
public’s
funds
are
used
to
further
the
banking
business
of
the
insider.
the
congressional
concern
as
it
was
expressed
in
the
senate
report
that
accompanied
the
legislation,
was
the
concern
with
the
unscrupulous
banks
who
advanced
their
own
pecuniary
interest
at
the
expense
of
investment
companies
and
their
security
holders.
indeed,
the
question
in
1940
was
not
how
little
but
rather
how
much
should
be
done
to
restrict
the
bank
interlock
and
indeed
whether
it
should
be
permitted
at
all.
and
that
section
10(c)
was
viewed
as
a
minimum
safeguard
for
there
were
those
who
advocated
the
complete
segregation
of
commercial
banks
from
investment
companies.
for
that
matter,
that
position
was
even
advocated
by
commercial
bankers
themselves
in
light
of
their
unhappy
experiences
during
the
20’s
in
terms
of
conflicts
in
the
operations
of
bank
sponsored
investment
companies.
and
particularly
significant
in
this
regard
is
the
observation
of
senator
robert
wagner
who
is
chairman
of
the
senate
banking
and
currency
committee
after
the
commission
had
put
in
its
testimony,
he
made
the
observation.
i
think
it
would
be
better
if
the
board
were
free
of
any
kind
of
influence
from
bankers.
of
course,
i
know
that
is
ideal
and
that
we
are
not
going
to
get
that
far.
but
then
there
would
be
no
chance
about
their
loyalty
being
consciously
or
subconsciously
only
to
their
investment
trust
rather
than
to
outside
interests.
the
commission
explained
10(c)
in
saying
that
it
viewed
10(c)
as
a
middle
of
the
road
approach
--
as
a
compromise.
it
was
put
as
instead
of
having
complete
segregation
of
commercial
bankers,
an
attempt
was
made
to
permit
it
and
then
just
circumscribe
it.
the
statutory
concern
with
bank
domination
of
investment
companies
is
not
only
limited
to
section
10(c)
but
it’s
further
manifested
in
section
10
(h)
(2)
of
the
act.
that
section
deals
with
the
type
of
investment
company
that
does
not
have
a
board
of
directors.
section
10
(h)
(2)
provides
that
the
investment
advisor
to
such
a
company
must
satisfy
the
standards
of
section
10(c).
a
bank
thus
could
not
be
an
investment
advisor
to
one
of
these
companies
that
does
not
have
a
board
of
directors.
in
other
words,
under
the
statute,
a
bank
may
only
serve
as
an
investment
advisor,
if
there's
a
buffer
of
board
of
directors
meeting
the
provisions
of
section
10(c).
in
our
view,
it
is
unmistakable
that
section
10(c)
was
intended
as
a
minimum
invest
to
protection
certainly
where
there
are
potential
conflicts
of
interest
and
now
turning
to
the
matter
of
the
conflicts
of
interest
that
exist
in
this
situation.
as
i've
indicated,
the
commission
acknowledged
that
there
are
potential
conflicts
of
interest
here
which
could
arise
as
a
result
of
the
bank’s
commercial
banking
business.
in
fact,
one
of
the
spokesmen
for
the
banking
industry
recently
in
urging
the
amendment
of
section
10,
acknowledged
the
fact
that
the
conflicts
problem
is
inherent
in
the
relationship.
and
in
a
situation
such
as
is
involved
here
where
the
bank
has
control
of
the
day-to-day
management
of
the
investment
company
where
the
free
reign
in
the
conduct
of
its
operations,
a
conflicts
problem
emerges
probably
as
sharply
as
it
ever
could.
the
only
aspects
of
the
problem
of
the
conflicts
problem
to
which
the
sec
addressed
itself
were
those
that
it
itself
had
referred
to,
in
1963
in
urging
that
the
section
10
prophylaxis
was
necessary
for
the
type
of
arrangement
that’s
involved
in
this
commingled
agency
account.
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
the
commission--
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
well,
the
commission
has
authority
under
the
statute
to
exempt
from
any
provision
of
the
statute
but
in
exercising
that,
it
must
bear
in
mind
these
statutory
policy
and
objectives.
it
cannot
order
--
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
or
in
abusing
the
discretion,
it
exceeded
its
authority
under
the
statute.
in
other
words,
the
issue
as
its
posited
here
is
whether
the
commission
in
the
circumstances
where
there
are
potential
conflicts
of
interest
may
consist
with
the
public
interest
policy
of
the
statute
granted
exemption.
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
that’s
right.
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
whether
or
not
it
may
have
--
whether
or
not
it
may
have
majority
control
of
that
board
of
directors
and
it
was
at
that
line
--
it
was
at
that
line
that
the
congress
drew
the
line
of
prophylaxis.
it
said
“you
may
have
to
--
out
of
a
board
of
five,
you
may
have
as
many
as
two
but
as
a
matter
of
prophylaxis,
as
a
matter
of
policy,
you
may
not
have
three.”
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
no.
a
word
about
the
structure
of
the
statute.
the
statute
grants
the
commission
considerable
flexibility
in
many
areas
of
the
statute.
it
permits
the
commission
to
exempt.
it
permits
the
commission
to
grant
various
types
of
orders
necessary
in
the
public
interest
and
things
of
that
nature.
however,
it
withheld
or
the
statute
withholds
that
type
of
specific
statutory
authority
--
exemptive
authority
or
molding
authority
in
section
10(c).
and
in
fact,
the
legislative
hearing
show
that
it
was
intended
in
section
10
not
to
provide
flexibility.
what
we
have
here
though
is
a
residual
authority
that
the
congress
granted
in
section
6(c).
in
that
authority,
the
congress
said
if
you
--
if
there
is
a
situation
that
isn’t
within
the
intent
of
the
legislation,
it
isn’t
the
kind
of
situation
in
which
the
evils
of
the
statute
are
directed,
doesn’t
fall
within
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
in
those
circumstances,
you
may
grant
an
exemption.
as
i
say,
the
only
aspects
of
the
problem
to
which
the
commission
addressed
itself
were
those
conflicts
that
in
itself
had
emphasized,
in
1963
congressional
hearings
in
urging
that
the
section
10
prophylaxis
was
necessary
for
the
type
of
arrangement
that
are
here
presented.
and
the
conflicts
which
the
commission
referred
to
and
they
are
four
in
number,
is
the
danger
that
the
bank
might
retain
an
unwarranted
portion
of
the
assets
of
the
bank
sponsored
fund
in
cash
in
order
to
earn
money
for
the
bank.
secondly,
that
banks
distribute
brokerage
according
to
a
formula
which
rewards
those
brokerage
who
keep
balances
in
the
bank
or
have
other
dealings
with
the
bank.
this
policy,
the
commission
pointed
out
in
’63
could
lead
to
excessive
portfolio
turnover
or
to
a
fund
not
receiving
maximum
benefit
from
its
brokerage
business.
thirdly,
that
fund
investments
could
be
used
to
shore
up
bank
loans
and
fourthly,
that
bankers
or
underwriters
and
dealers
and
various
kinds
of
government
bonds
that
they
might
use
the
fund
as
a
place
to
place
those
bonds.
now,
these
aren’t
the
only
conflicts
of
interest.
these
are
the
ones
that
the
commission
addressed
itself
to,
there
are
others.
for
example,
a
bank
may
use
the
investment
company
as
a
bird
hock
(ph)
that
is
it
may
have
the
fund
make
an
investment
in
the
company
in
the
hopes
or
in
order
to
get
the
commercial
banking
business
of
the
particular
company.
there's
also
a
companion
problem.
the
nature
of
which
was
alluded
to
in
the
congressional
hearings.
the
situation
of
where
a
fund
holds
securities
of
a
company
which
is
an
important
commercial
banking
customer.
and
the
sale
would
appear
to
be
advisable
but
the
sale
would
depress
the
market
price,
something
that
the
company
managements
don’t
like.
the
question
is
whether
in
those
circumstances,
the
bank
would
be
able
or
the
bank
directors
would
be
able
to
look
at
the
matter
of
the
disposition
of
that
investment
with
an
eye
singled
to
the
interest
of
the
fund
or
would
his
thinking
be
concerned
by
the
impact
on
the
commercial
banking
customer.
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
the
6(c)
power?
yes.
the
6(c)
power
is
exercised
frequently
by
the
commission.
the
matter
of
the
commission’s
authority
under
6(c)
i
don’t
believe
has
ever
really
been
considered
by
a
court
and
the
6(c)
orders
ordinarily
come
up
in
the
context
of
where
there
is
no
opposition
to
the
grant
of
the
exemption
so
that
the
6(c)
grant
--
it
becomes
pretty
much
a
formal
matter.
there
are
cases
though
where
there
is
opposition.
but
as
i
say
relatively,
they
are
rare
situations.
the
matter
becomes
one
between
the
staff
of
the
commission
and
the
applicant
and
if
the
commission
is
willing
to
grant
the
order,
the
applicant
of
course
is
very
happy
and
there
isn’t
anybody
to
challenge.
and
that’s
why
there's
very
little
opposition.
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
pardon?
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
yes.
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
evidentiary
hearing
before
the
commission.
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
there
was
oral
argument
and
briefs.
we
took
the
position
before
the
commission
that
the
bank’s
application
did
not
make
out
either
a
factual
or
legal
basis
on
which
to
grant
the
exemption,
we
didn’t
feel
that
we
ought
to
be
asking
for
an
evidentiary
hearing.
we
thought
that
the
burden
was
on
the
bank
to
show
that
it
--
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
that’s
the
applicant
for
the
exemption.
and
in
fact,
the
only
ground
that
the
bank
advanced
in
its
application
was
the
fact
that
unless
it
got
this
exemption,
it
wouldn’t
be
able
to
go
forward
in
this
particular
mutual
fund
business
.now,
the
overall
problem
that’s
presented
here
in
terms
of
conflicts
was
probably
as
well
presented
as
possible
by
one
of
the
commissioners
in
this
case
during
the
course
of
oral
argument.
and
i
might
add
it
was
not
the
commissioner
who
dissented
who
observed
that
the
bank’s
application
presented
as
he
put
it
in
a
very
exaggerated
or
extreme
form.
the
problem
of
the
old
matter
of
joint
ventures
of
seeming
joint
ventures
where
the
bank
on
the
one
hand
in
the
exercise
of
its
various
functions
has
relationship
with
the
company
and
your
account
for
various
reasons
also
has
relationships
with
the
company.
and
who
is
to
say
where
the
propriety
line
should
be
drawn
and
is
drawn?
and
bank
counsel's
response
at
that
point
was
that
he
acknowledged
the
problem
and
he
said
that
the
bank
would
have
to
liquidate.
finally,
as
the
dissenting
commissioner
pointed
out
in
the
exact
form
of
future
conflicts
be
anticipated.
in
these
circumstances,
we
submit
there
is
presently
evil
to
which
section
10(c)
is
directed
namely
potential
conflicts
of
interest.
and
by
the
sec’s
own
standards
for
the
application
of
section
6(c),
an
exemption
is
therefore
improper.
now,
the
commission
did
attempt
to
rationalize
an
exemption.
and
we
submit
of
course,
that
the
analysis
is
erroneous.
first
and
what
is
an
unusual
stance
for
the
commission
in
administering
this
remedial
statute.
the
commission
endeavored
to
restrict
the
intent
and
scope
of
the
statutes.
although
the
statute
speaks
in
terms
of
no
registered
investment
company,
the
commission
said
congress
really
didn’t
mean
it.
and
in
this
regard
--
it
also
pointed
out
that
this
account
did
not
become
permissible
until
1963
with
the
new
comptroller's
regulation.
and
in
terms
of
endeavoring
to
find
a
basis
to
distinguish
it
--
this
particular
fund,
it
said
that
the
fund
was
different
from
the
bank
dominated
investment
companies
that
were
described
in
the
commission's
study.
now
as
far
as
the
account
not
becoming
permissible
until
1963,
i
submit
that
that’s
irrelevant.
in
the
account’s
pursed
after
1940
doesn’t
negate
the
potentials
for
conflict
and
that’s
what
is
the
statute’s
concern
under
section
10(c).
insofar
as
the
commission
looked
to
the
bank
affiliates
of
the
20’s
and
tried
to
find
identity,
the
commission’s
own
study
in
describing
these
bank
affiliate
says
and
i
quote
that
“these
affiliates
acted
as
investment
companies
in
buying
and
selling
securities
for
an
investment
for
speculative
purposes.”
it
was
for
this
reason
that
section
10(c)
was
enacted
and
it
is
precisely
this
function
that
the
account
or
this
bank
sponsor
mutual
fund
will
engage
in.
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
furthermore
--
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
that’s
right
and
what
i
am
saying
is
that
one
of
the
functions
of
those
bank
securities
affiliates
in
the
20’s
as
described
in
the
commission
study
was
that
those
affiliates
among
other
things
engaged
in
the
business
of
buying
and
selling
securities
for
investment
or
speculative
purposes
and
it
was
because
they
engaged
in
that
particular
activity
in
the
investment
company
business
that
they
became
subject
to
the
investment
company
act
and
section
10(c)
was
adopted.
in
any
event,
the
statute
itself
patently
rejects
this
commission
approach
that
the
application
of
section
10(c)
turns
on
whether
a
particular
company
has
a
kinship
to
the
bank
affiliates
of
the
1920’s.
and
i
refer
specifically
to
section
10(d)
of
the
investment
company
act.
10(d)
deals
with
the
so-called
no
load
companies
that
are
managed
by
investment
counselors.
now,
those
companies
at
a
special
situation,
those
companies
are
granted
the
matter
of
exemptions
from
section
10.
it
was
considered
for
those
companies.
these
are
open-end
companies.
a
matter
of
exemptions
for
those
companies
was
specifically
considered.
they
were
granted
certain
exemptions
from
10(a)
and
from
10(b),
the
companies
have
no
kinship
to
the
bank
securities
affiliates
of
the
1920’s
but
congress
specifically
withheld
an
exemption
from
10(c).
and
it’s
particularly
interesting
that
in
so
called
10(d)
company,
the
no
load
company,
there
is
less
of
a
chance
of
the
potential
conflicts
of
interest
because
by
hypothesis,
those
companies
cannot
be
managed
by
banks.
furthermore,
the
broad
provision
of
section
10(c)
is
such
that
it
reaches
to
all
types
of
investment
companies
for
example,
i
referred
already
to
the
so
called
10
(h)
(2)
company.
the
company
that
doesn’t
have
a
board
of
directors.
congress
said
we
want
10(c)
to
apply
there
where
it
can
and
furthermore
it
applies
to
face
amounts
of
certificate
companies
which
had
absolutely
no
kinship
or
identity
with
the
bank
security
affiliates
of
the
1920’s.
now,
the
commission
did
attempt
to
come
to
grips
with
the
conflicts
problem
and
what
it
said
was
that
there
were
substantial
safeguards
here
against
conflicts.
that’s
its
characterization
substantial
conflicts.
and
we
submit
that
that
doesn’t
answer
the
statutory
question.
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
by
the
comptroller
and
also
the
self
dealing
prohibitions
in
the
investment
company
act
and
in
the
comptroller
regulations.
basically,
the
comptroller’s
regulations
really
don’t
add
anything
to
what
the
investment
company
act
provides.
the
commission
in
its
opinion
here
in
referring
to
the
substantial
safeguards
made
reference
in
the
first
instance
of
the
comptroller’s
regulations
to
the
inspections
of
the
comptroller.
the
fact
is
--
and
the
commission
made
no
reference
to
it
that
it
has
inspection
authorities
of
investment
companies
and
as
the
commissioner
who
is
the
spokesman
for
the
commission
during
the
legislative
hearings
pointed
out,
the
purpose
of
that
inspection
authority
was
to
permit
the
commission
to
engage
in
the
same
kind
of
inspections
as
were
permitted
for
the
comptroller
under
the
bank.
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
well,
on
that
one,
the
commission
imposed
a
further
condition
that
goes
beyond
the
statute.
and
the
commission
found
that
it
saw
no
likelihood
that
there
would
be
any
overreaching
by
the
bank
--
qua-investment
banker.
and
i
might
add
in
that
regard
that
the
commission
was
very
careful
to
refrain
from
making
that
same
observation
about
the
bank
and
its
capacity
as
to
whether
--
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
pardon?
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
there
is
a
condition
that
was
added
in
terms
of
the
underwriting
or
underwritings
by
the
bank.
turning
back
to
the
matter
of
the
supervision
of
the
comptroller,
as
i
say
the
statute
granted
the
commission
the
authority
to
inspect
investment
companies.
as
i've
indicated
earlier,
the
statute
authorized
the
commission
while
the
statute
prohibits
itself
dealing
imposes
fiduciary
obligations.
and
nevertheless,
it
imposed
there's
a
prophylaxis,
this
10(c)
requirement.
now
the
fact
that
--
we
submit
the
fact
that
there
may
also
be
regulation
or
inspections
by
the
comptroller,
inspections
as
far
as
the
statute
is
concerned
that
are
no
broader
than
the
commission
is
empowered
to
make
under
the
investment
company
act
is
no
reason
to
deny
investors
in
this
mutual
fund
the
specific
10(c)
prophylaxis
against
domination
by
a
bank
investment
company.
the
congress
thought
that
inspection
or
government
oversight
was
enough.
it
was
already
in
the
investment
company
act.
that
didn’t
have
to
provide
for
10(c).
i’ll
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
mr.
justice
black
may
it
please
the
court.
i
wanted
to
clarify
a
response
that
i
gave
yesterday
in
connection
with
the
question
that
mr.
justice
harlan
directed
with
respect
to
the
commission's
use
of
section
6(c).
i
said
that
exempt
of
authority
was
used
frequently
and
it
is.
but
i
did
not
mean
that
it
was
used
frequently
in
connection
with
section
10(c).
the
commission
has
used
section
6(c)
in
two
cases
both
on
the
same
day
back
in
1959
in
an
opposed
order
and
there
was
no
opinion
but
the
--
in
those
cases
in
one
of
them
--
all
of
the
stock
of
the
investment
company
and
it
was
not
an
open-ended
investment
company
regarding
variety
of
investment
company
of
the
kind
that
we
have
in
this
situation.
but
rather
a
small
business
investment
company.
it’s
a
special
arrangement
designed
to
facilitate
loans
to
small
business
concerns.
in
one
of
the
cases
all
of
the
stock
of
the
small
business
investment
company
was
owned
by
the
bank
itself.
in
the
other
case,
the
stock
was
owned
by
the
bank
and
by
a
trustee
for
the
benefit
of
stockholders
and
in
the
recitals
in
those
particular
orders.
in
both
orders,
there’s
the
same
recital.
and
the
recital
is
that
the
applicant
investment
company
believes
that
it’s
entitled
to
the
exemption
and
i
quote,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
public
investor
interest
in
applicant
investment
company
is
confined
to
the
shareholders
of
the
bank.
so
that
there
we
have
the
very
much
different
situation
than
we
have
here
because
you
don’t
have
the
potential
conflicts
of
interest
between
the
bank
and
the
investment
company.
now,
in
terms
of
the
scope
of
the
statute,
i
simply
want
to
make
it
clear
that
the
type
of
relationship,
the
commingled
agency
account
is
a
relationship
that
is
very
specifically
reached
by
the
statute.
the
legislative
history
refers
to
the
situation
of
the
commingled
agency
account.
it’s
not
a
bank
sponsored
account.
but
there
was
a
situation
specifically
referred
to
in
the
legislative
history
of
where
certain
people
had
deposited
money
on
an
agency
basis
with
an
individual
and
that
individual
managed
the
money.
he
pooled
it.
and
the
legislative
history
treats
that
particular
commingled
managed
agency
account
as
an
investment
company.
indeed,
the
commission
in
its
report
to
the
congress
in
the
first
volume
of
the
investment
trust
study
in
part
one
at
page
24
in
talking
of
the
types
of
relationships
that
give
rise
to
the
investment
company
refers
to
the
corporate
form,
to
the
massachusetts
trust,
to
the
joint
stock
company
and
lastly
to
the
agency
relationship.
and
i
want
to
quote
from
that
report
“it’s
a
brief
passage
which
indicates
what
the
commission
was
thinking
about.”
another
distinctive
form
of
organization
of
investment
companies
involves
an
agency
relationship
between
the
individual
contributors
to
the
fund
and
the
management
upon
whom
they
confer
substantially
a
power
of
attorney
to
act
as
agent
in
the
investment
of
the
monies
contributed.
the
group
of
individuals
is
not
a
legal
entity
but
rather
constitutes
in
essence
the
combination
of
distinct
individual
interest.
now,
the
problem
of
the
commingled
account
and
as
i
say
not
in
terms
of
the
bank
but
the
general
concept
of
the
commingled
account
is
considered
in
considerable
detail
in
the
commission's
opinion
in
the
prudential
case
which
was
affirmed
by
the
third
circuit,
the
citation
is
in
our
brief.
and
there’s
a
full
exploration
of
that
particular
aspect
of
the
investment
company
act.
now,
with
respect
to
the
exemption
for
the
common
trust
fund
that’s
been
referred
to
here.
the
commission
itself
in
this
very
prudential
case
that
i
just
referred
to
indeed
in
the
third
circuit
adopted
the
very
language
of
the
commission.
the
commission
said
the
following,
it
referring
to
the
congress
rested
this
exemption
on
the
special
considerations
that
the
funds
were
used
for
bonafide
the
fiduciary
purposes
rather
than
as
a
medium
for
general
public
investment
and
had
only
a
limited
impact
in
the
investment
fund
picture.
and
that
the
commission
did
prepare
as
part
of
this
investment
trust
study,
did
prepare
a
special
small
volume,
pamphlet
dealing
with
the
matter
of
the
common
trust
fund.
now,
point
number
one,
the
commission
did
not
make
an
extensive
study
of
the
common
trust
fund.
one
of
the
--
investigating
to
the
matter
of
the
abuses
that
were
involved
in
the
operation
of
the
common
trust
fund
--
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
that’s
right.
and
the
commission
pointed
out
and
one
of
the
reasons
for
it
was
is
that
at
time,
they
were
all
tools
and
16
common
trust
funds
in
the
country.
and
in
the
aggregate
they
represented
that
i
believe
about
$36
million.
there
was
nothing
of
consequence
in
terms
of
the
common
trust
fund.
and
the
commission
pointed
out
in
that
report
that
the
participation
in
the
fund
and
i’m
quoting
now
“in
the
common
trust
fund
is
not
available
to
the
general
public.”
and
indeed,
the
commission
at
that
time
in
providing
the
exemption
for
the
common
trust
fund
had
before
it,
the
regulations
of
the
federal
reserve
board
with
reference
to
common
trust
funds
and
one
of
the
specific
provisions
in
the
regulations
of
the
common
trust
fund
at
that
time
and
these
appear
in
the
appendix
to
the
commission’s
study
on
the
commingled
trust
account.
the
regulations
refer
to
the
fact
that
the
common
trust
fund
means
a
fund
maintained
by
a
national
bank
exclusively
for
the
collective
investment
and
reinvestment
of
monies
contributed
thereto
by
the
bank
in
its
capacity,
its
trustee,
executor,
administrator,
or
guardian.
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
and
this
is
of
particular
significance.
the
purpose
of
this
section
is
to
permit
the
use
of
common
trust
funds
as
defined
in
section
169
of
the
revenue
act
of
1936,
for
the
investment
of
funds
held
by
true
fiduciary
purposes.
and
then
it
goes
on
and
the
operation
of
such
common
trust
funds
as
investment
trusts
for
other
than
strictly
fiduciary
purposes
is
forbidden.
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
well,
the
federal
reserve
board
prior
to
1963
when
it
administered
the
regulations
with
respect
to
the
common
trust
fund
said
that
you
could
not
use
for
common
trust
fund
by
the
device
of
an
inter-vivos
trust
for
the
--
or
to
get
a
participation
in
this
common
trust
when
you
couldn’t
use
it
as
a
means
in
effect
for
public
participation
in
a
pool
of
securities.
you
couldn’t
use
it
for
the
very
purpose
that
it
is
being
--
that
the
commingled
account
is
being
used.
in
other
words
--
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
it
could
not
be
used.
i’d
rather
put
it
this
way
that
the
common
trust
fund
could
not
be
used
as
means
for
soliciting
public
participation
in
the
pool
of
securities
for
public
investment
through
the
guys
of
an
inter-vivos
trust.
mr.
joseph
b.
levin
he
could
use
the
trust
relationship,
create
the
trust
but
as
i
say
in
terms
of
the
scope
of
the
regulation
as
it
was
administered
by
the
federal
reserve
board
was
that
the
trust
relationship
was
not
to
be
used
as
it
is
being
used
here.
actually,
it
isn’t
a
trust
relationship.
it’s
called
a
commingled
account
where
in
effect
you
go
out
and
create
a
common
package
of
securities
for
all
commerce
to
come
in
and
make
an
investment
in
what
is
a
mutual
fund.
and
the
federal
reserve
board
as
it
administered
the
common
trust
fund
provision
that
said
if
you
do
have
an
individualized
relationship,
the
kind
of
thing
that
you
have
in
a
trust
relationship
where
you
can
pool
it
but
you
cannot
go
up
and
create
an
investment
company
and
use
the
common
trust
fund
as
a
device
to
solicit
or
public
participations
which
is
precisely
what
is
being
created
here
and
it
is
for
that
very
reason
that
the
commission
had
said
that
it’s
subject
to
investment
company.
