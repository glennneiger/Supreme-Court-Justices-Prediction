white
wasn’t
it
plus
the
issuing
of
certificates
of
participation
or
whatever
you
call
it,
the
selling
of
shares?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
a
purpose
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
that
respect
mr.
cox,
what
is
the
governing
law?
what
would
be
the
governing
law
as
between
the
bank
and
the
people
who
were
investing
in
this
fund
or
giving
their
money
to
the
bank?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
--
just
for
curiosity,
what
would
restrict
the
bank
from
using
the
funds
of
his
customers
in
this
fund
for
banking
purposes.
could
they
invest
this
money
in
commercial
loans?
justice
byron
r.
white
right,
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
any
investment
say
make
it
up
with
outsiders.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
the
usual
open-end
fund
may
a
holder
of
a
share
or
a
holder
of
participating
certificate
sell
his
certificate
to
another
person?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
to
the
extent
that
it
happens
is
permitted
in
this
kind
of
a
fund
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
--
does
the
bank
in
this
case
use
its
own
selling
organization
to
sell
the
shares
or
does
it
have
a
contract
for
somebody
to
sell
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
usual
--
an
open-end
fund
normally
would
have
an
extensive
selling
organization?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
--
you
say
the
bank
does
it
itself
through
its
own
employees
and
agent?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
they
have
any
officers
around
--
sales
officers
which
are
not
in
some
branch
bank?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn’t
use
and
it
doesn’t
use
other
banks
to
sell
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn’t
part
of
your
argument
here
that
this
is
improper
banking
business?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you’re
arguing
here
that
running
of
this
kind
of
an
investment
account
is
the
proper
banking
business
in
effect,
aren’t
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
is
it
not
really
what
was
involved
in
the
data
processing?
justice
byron
r.
white
hasn’t
congress
pretty
clearly
expressed
itself
that
the
bank
shouldn’t
engaged
in
non-banking
business?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
a
separate
statute
of
the
service
corporations
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
say
even
proceeding
that
comptroller
was
wholly
wrong
for
letting
the
bank
engage
in
this
collective
investment
activities
that
these
people
have
no
legal
interest
to
complain?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
they
have
standing
to
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
arnold
tours,
it
would
be
--
end
up
the
same
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it’s
been
wasting
our
time
in
data
processing
this
--
?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
they’re
only
going
to
be
meant
by
your
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
friedman,
in
the
data
processing
case,
the
conclusion
of
the
majority
was
that
under
the
bank
service
corporation
act
and
the
national
bank
act
the
petitioners,
the
dara
processing
company,
as
competitor
to
national
bank
which
are
engaging
in
data
processing
services
are
within
that
class
of
aggrieved
persons
who
under
section
702
are
entitled
to
judicial
review
of
agency
action.
now
you
say,
yes,
they
are
entitled
to
judicial
review,
but
so
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
they’re
asking
for
here
is
judicial
review
of
the
agency
action.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
don’t
think
this
meant
if
they
could
get
the
judicial
review
but
if
the
court
decided
the
agency
was
wrong
and
it
would
say
“awfully
sorry,
but
it
won’t
do
you
any
good?"
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
not
a
matter
in
federal
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
it
is
certainly
a
ruling
somewhere?
justice
byron
r.
white
excuse
me
for
a
moment.
i
think
that
the
new
york
law
has
the
comptroller
ruling
(inaudible)
prohibits
the
bank
from
buying
from
the
fund
any
property?
justice
byron
r.
white
page
2
of
section
92
says
the
bank
may
purchase
for
a
common
account
or
joint
account
which
just
like
to
invest
from
any
depot
or
mortgage
on
certain
condition.
justice
byron
r.
white
just
the
--
the
next
section
at
the
one
you’re
reading,
i
believe
in
page
9,
paragraph
8,
roman
numeral
ii
(inaudible)
just
any
that
fall
on
mortgage,
how
about
the
fund?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
there
are
several
provisions
there,
but
nevertheless,
this
is
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
invest
the
fund,
then
whatever
plan
--
justice
byron
r.
white
according
to
the
fund
they’re
already
operating,
they
are
already
operating
under
comptroller
ruling
as
i
understand
it
and
the
plan
is
under
section
9
is
to
have
this
system
replace
the
mortgage
fund?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
on
page
27a,
such
as
replied
mortgage
fund
has
been
operating
pursuant
to
section
17,
they
are
going
to

have
mutual
directors
with
a
typical
of
an
end
investment
fund?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
know
but
why?
what’s
the
purpose
of
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
why
would
they
want
a
bank
in

why
would
they
want
the

board
of

to
be
running
one
company
as
well
as
the
other?
justice
byron

is
there
any

that
there

that

of
