mr.
g.
duane
vieth
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case,
the
broad
issue,
is
whether
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
has
authority
to
permit
national
banks
to
operate
commingled
investment
funds
for
managing
agency
accounts
such
as
the
fund
involved
in
no.59,
which
just
been
argued.
notwithstanding
the
provisions
of
the
1933
glass-steagall
legislation
as
amended.
however,
since
it
appears
to
be
conceded
all
around
that
the
ordinary
open-end
mutual
fund
which
i
shall
describe
in
just
a
moment,
is
prohibited
by
the
glass-steagall
legislation
from
engaging
in
the
banking
business
and
conversely
that
banks
are
prohibited
from
operating
garden
variety
or
traditional
open-end
mutual
funds.
the
narrow
issue
before
the
court,
we
submit,
is
whether
in
sum
and
substance,
a
commingled
investment
account
of
the
kind
that
has
been
discussed
in
the
last
case
in
which
will
be
discussed
in
this
case,
whether
such
an
account
is
in
sum
and
substance
an
ordinary
open-end
mutual
fund.
the
petitioners
in
this
case
of
the
investment
company
institute
which
represents
most
of
the
mutual
funds
or
open-end
investment
companies
in
the
united
states,
and
the
number
of
individual
members
of
that
institute.
the
action
was
brought
in
the
district
court
against
the
comptroller
of
the
currency,
asserting
that
his
regulation,
9.18,
which
purported
to
permit
this
type
of
activity,
was
unlawful
because
it
violated
the
glass-steagall
act.
and
also
because
it
permitted
activity
in
excess
of
the
trust
powers
which
the
comptroller
is
authorized
to
grant
national
banks
under
section
92
(a)
of
the
national
banking
act.
the
district
court
found
that
the
regulations
were
invalid
on
both
contentions.
the
matter
was
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
on
both
matters.
first,
i
should
like
to
briefly
summarize
the
four
sections
of
the
glass-steagall
act
of
1933,
which
we
believe
are
applicable
to
this
case.
the
court
will
recall
that
the
glass-steagall
legislation
was
passed
in
1933
and
was
prompted
by
the
almost
complete
breakdown
of
this
nation’s
major
financial
institutions
during
the
late
1920’s.
a
number
of
reforms
in
the
national
banking
legislation
which
are
today
accepted
as
common
place
such
as
the
insurance
by
the
federal
deposit
insurance
company
of
national
bank
deposits
and
state
banks'
deposits,
and
other
banking
provisions
were
adopted
in
the
glass-steagall
legislation.
however,
the
central
purpose
of
glass-steagall
was
to
eliminate
the
inherent
conflicts
of
interest
which
are
present
in
the
conduct
by
the
same
entity
or
closely
affiliated
entities
of
the
business
of
commercial
banking
on
the
one
hand,
the
business
of
receiving
deposits.
subject
to
demand,
the
activity
of
commercial
banking
on
the
one
hand
and
the
securities
business,
the
business
of
investment
banking
or
the
business
of
issuing,
selling,
distributing,
and
underwriting
securities
on
the
other
hand.
and
there
were
as
i
say
four
central
provisions
designed
to
accomplish
this
purpose.
the
keystone
provision
is
section
21,
12
u.s.c.,
section
378.
now,
unlike
the
other
sections
that
are
involved
in
this
case,
some
of
which
apply
only
to
national
banks
and
some
of
which
apply
only
to
banks
which
are
members
of
the
federal
reserve
system,
and
i
might
mention
that
all
national
banks
are
members
of
that
federal
reserve
system,
they
are,
however,
most
of
the
banks
in
the
united
states
are
state
banks
which
are
not
members
of
the
federal
reserve
system,
but
unlike
those
other
sections,
section
21
applies
to
all
banks,
state
or
national,
members
or
not
members
of
the
federal
reserve
system.
in
the
broadest
possible
language,
section
21
requires
the
complete
divorce
of
the
business
of
commercial
banking
from
the
business
--
from
the
securities
business.
it
prohibits
the
simultaneous
engagement
in
the
business
of
receiving
deposits
subject
to
withdrawal
by
check
or
other
means,
which
namely
is
the
business
of
commercial
banking
and
engaging
at
the
same
time
in
the
business
of
issuing
or
underwriting,
or
selling,
or
distributing
stocks,
bonds,
debentures,
notes,
or
other
securities.
section
16
of
the
national
banking
act
is
also
relevant.
it
however
applies
only
to
national
banks
and
indeed
is
the
provision
of
the
national
banking
act
which
sets
forth
the
corporate
powers
of
the
national
banks.
in
doing
so,
it
enacted
two
limitations
or
--
i
beg
pardon,
two
exemptions
to
the
broad
provisions
of
the
other
provisions
of
the
glass-steagall
act.
it
did
first
permit
and
authorized
national
banks
to
underwrite
and
sell
a
strictly
limited
list
of
government
bonds.
and
secondly,
it
expressly
confirmed
the
right
of
all
national
banks,
whether
or
not
they
exercised
trust
powers,
to
perform
an
accommodation
service
for
customers
by
permitting
banks
to
purchase
some
sale
securities
solely
upon
the
order
and
for
the
account
of
customers,
and
not
for
the
account
of
the
bank.
i
refer
to
this
is
an
accommodation
service.
the
legislative
history
makes
it
clear
and
become
contemporaneous
publications
of
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
in
1933
and
1934
make
it
clear
that
this
service
was
intended
for
the
smaller
banks
located
in
smaller
communities
where
the
ordinary
services
of
the
broker
dealer
were
not
available.
that
situation
may
not
prevail
to
a
great
extent
today,
but
certainly
in
1933,
there
were
many
communities
where
the
banker
was
the
only
man
who
could
buy
or
sell
a
security
solely
upon
an
order
and
for
the
account
of
the
customer,
that
was
the
second
exception
permitted
by
section
16.
however,
in
granting
these
two
very
limited
exceptions,
congress
made
it
clear
in
section
16
once
again
that
a
broad
prohibition
of
--
a
broad
repeal
of
the
prohibitions
of
section
21
were
not
intended
because
section
16
specifically
says
that
a
bank
may
not
underwrite
any
issue
of
securities
or
stock.
the
third
provision
applicable
here,
section
32
and
also
i
should
refer
to
section
20.
these
two
sections
were
intended
to
prevent
the
violation
of
the
prohibitions
of
section
21
through
the--
indirectly,
through
the
use
of
affiliations
or
interlocks.
section
32
which
applies
only
to
member
banks
provides
that
no
person
affiliated
with
a
company
primarily
engaged
in
the
issue
or
floatation,
underwriting,
public
sell
or
distribution
of
securities
may
serve
at
the
same
time
as
an
officer
or
director
or
employee
of
a
member
bank.
section
20
prohibited
certain
defined
affiliations
between
member
banks
on
the
one
hand
and
corporations
engaged
principally
in
the
issue
of
floatation,
underwriting
and
so
forth
of
stocks
and
bonds.
and
so
sections
32
and
20
were
intended
to
prohibit
indirect
violations
of
the
broad
prohibition
of
section
21.
now
as
i
have
previously
indicated,
we
believe
that
the
narrow
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
a
bank
commingled
investment
fund
of
the
type
here
under
consideration
is
in
sum
and
substance
a
mutual
fund.
it
has
been
repeatedly
held
by
the
federal
reserve
board
that
a
traditional
mutual
fund
is
subject
to
the
glass-steagall
act.
that
the
activity
of
a
traditional
mutual
fund
is
the
kind
of
activity
contemplated
by
the
glass-steagall
act.
and
this
fact
seems
to
be
conceded
all
around.
it
seems
to
be
conceded
that
a
bank
as
i
say
may
not
operate
a
traditional
mutual
fund,
nor
may
a
traditional
mutual
fund
go
into
the
banking
business.
so
then
we
come
to
the
question,
is
there
a
significant
difference
between
this
fund
and
a
traditional
mutual
fund,
or
are
they
as
we
contend
in
sum
and
substance,
the
very
same
thing.
i
think
in
order
to
demonstrate
this
point
with
clarity,
i
should
like
to
stress
several
of
the
characteristics
of
traditional
mutual
funds
and
demonstrate
how
the
commingled
investment
fund,
typified
by
the
city
bank
fund
before
the
court
are
in
sum
and
substance,
the
same
thing
as
a
matter
of
law.
a
traditional
mutual
fund
typically
is
corporate
in
form.
however,
there
are
many
traditional
mutual
funds
that
are
non-corporate
entities
such
as
trusts
or
other
business
associations.
a
traditional
mutual
fund
is
continually
issuing
participations
or
ownership
interests
in
the
funds.
they
are
frequently
called
shares
of
common
stock
because
a
traditional
mutual
fund
is
typically
or
frequently
a
corporation,
but
mutual
fund
shares
of
the
garden
variety
type
also
have
a
variety
of
other
names,
such
as
beneficial
interests,
participate
in
agreements
and
the
like.
now,
in
the
case
of
the
commingled
investment
fund
of
the
national
city
bank,
their
ownership
interests
or
participations
are
called
“units
of
participation,”
very
similar
to
the
participating
agreements
that
are
issued
by
some
traditional
mutual
funds.
also
in
the
case
of
the
city
bank’s
fund,
it
is
not
a
corporate
entity,
but
it
is
a
separate
entity
and
has
been
so
recognized
and
is
registered
under
the
investment
company
act,
as
has
been
indicated
in
the
prior
case.
the
ownership
interests
or
participations
in
an
ordinary
and
open-end
mutual
fund,
maybe
issued
subject
to
a
sales
charge
or
they
may
be
issued
on
a
so
called
no
load
basis,
where
no
sales
charge
is
exacted.
the
ownership
interests
in
the
bank
commingled
fund
of
the
city
bank
type
are
sold
on
this
no
load
basis.
an
ordinary
mutual
fund
typically
invests
and
reinvests
the
proceeds
from
the
sale
of
the
securities
in
the
fund
in
the
portfolio
securities
in
accordance
with
the
investment
policy
stated
for
the
fund.
the
bank
mutual
fund
of
the
kind
that
we
have
under
consideration
here
does
exactly
the
same
thing.
it
has
adopted
an
investment
policy.
it
sells
the
securities
in
the
fund
and
invests
the
proceeds
of
those
securities
in
accordance
with
the
stated
investment
policy.
the
securities
issued
by
the
ordinary
mutual
fund
are
not
traded
back
and
forth
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange
or
any
stock
exchange
in
the
ordinary
course,
nor
they
are
traded
in
the
over
the
counter
market.
rather
an
investor
in
an
ordinary
mutual
fund
who
desires
to
get
his
money
merely
turns
the
--
his
certificate
into
the
fund
and
it
is
redeemed
in
cash
for
its
asset
value.
indeed,
that
is
the
hallmark
of
an
open-end
investment
company,
the
right
at
any
time
to
redeem
your
investment
for
cash.
the
same
privilege
is
available
in
exactly
the
same
form
to
the
investor,
the
purchaser
of
the
security
in
the
city
bank,
commingled
investment
fund.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
he
may
do
that.
as
the
record
in
this
case
shows,
it
is
virtually
never
done,
mr.
justice.
there
is
virtually
no
trading
in
the
shares
or
participations
in
the
ordinary
--
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
in
this
kind
of
a
fund
as
i
understand
it,
under
the
--
it
is
not
prohibited
by
the
comptroller’s
regulation,
but
by
the
particular
fund.
the
city
bank
fund
does
not
permit
that
kind
of
trading.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
now
in
order
to
facilitate
this
right
of
redemption
that
i
have
referred
to,
an
ordinary
mutual
fund
values
the
assets
of
its
portfolio
regularly,
usually
twice
daily
and
now
as
required
under
sec
regulations
to
do
so
twice
daily
and
the
same
kind
of
evaluation
takes
place
with
respect
to
this
first
national
city
fund.
it
is
valued
--
the
assets
were
valued
as
often
as
necessary
so
as
to
facilitate
this
right
of
redemption.
and
because
of
this
right
of
redemption,
the
hallmark
as
i
say
of
an
open-end
fund,
there
is
continual
pressure
upon
the
operator
of
any
such
fund
to
sell
new
securities
because
regularly,
people
are
redeeming
their
investment
and
asking
for
their
money
back.
and
the
assets
of
the
fund
would
naturally
shrink
unless
there
are
continual
new
sales
so
as
to
provide
new
money
for
the
purpose
of
handling
these
redemptions.
and
the
same
pressures
are
present
with
respect
to
this
bank's
commingled
fund.
i
might
mention
that
those
pressures
were
referred
to
by
the
federal
reserve
board
in
many
rulings
in
which
it
is
held
that
the
ordinary
mutual
fund
is
primarily
engaged
in
issuing
and
selling
securities.
it
must
be
so
primarily
engage
says
the
federal
reserve
board
because
it
is
under
constant
pressure
to
raise
new
cash
to
handle
redemptions.
indeed,
the
record
of
this
--
in
this
case
contains
an
affidavit
by
a
vice
president
of
the
first
national
city
bank
respecting
the
bank
commingled
fund,
the
city
bank's
funds,
in
which
that
official
states
that
if
new
participations
were
not
taken
in
from
to
time
in
the
city
bank
fund,
the
commingled
account
as
it
is
called,
would
inevitably
shrink
in
size
as
a
result
to
withdrawals,
again,
a
point
of
direct
similarity
between
that
from
in
the
traditional
mutual
fund.
a
traditional
mutual
fund
is
typically
controlled
ultimately
by
a
governing
board
such
as
the
board
of
directors
or
board
of
trustees.
and
as
we
have
heard,
the
board
of
directors
of
first
national
fund
is
called
a
committee,
but
it
operates
in
exactly
the
same
fashion
as
a
board
of
directors
or
board
of
trustees.
now
in
an
ordinary
mutual
fund,
the
day-to-day
management
including
the
advices
to
the
purchase
and
sale
of
the
portfolio
securities
is
typically
provided
by
an
investment
advisor
pursuant
to
an
investment
advisory
contract,
and
the
same
thing
is
true
here.
first
national
city
bank
acts
as
an
investment
advisor
to
that
commingled
account
and
it
provides
the
day-to-day
management
services,
and
the
investment
advice,
and
it
does
so
pursuant
to
an
investment
advisory
contract.
a
traditional
mutual
fund
typically
has
a
contract
with
the
principle
underwriter
who
handles
the
sale
of
the
securities
or
participations
in
the
mutual
fund.
again,
first
national
city
bank
has
executed
the
contract
with
its
commingled
account
under
which
it
agrees
to
act
as
principle
underwriter
and
is
responsible
for
the
sale
of
the
securities
in
that
fund.
in
both
cases,
the
funds
are
registered
as
investment
companies
under
the
investment
company
act
of
1940
as
we
have
seen.
in
both
cases,
the
participations
or
shares
in
the
fund
are
registered
with
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
as
securities
under
the
securities
act
of
1933.
in
both
cases,
the
pool
fund
itself
is
held
out
to
the
public
as
an
investment
medium.
and
in
both
cases,
the
essence
is
that
the
pool
of
securities,
purchased
with
the
money
derived
from
the
sale
of
participation
is
used
to
buy
and
sell
securities
in
the
fund's
portfolio
--

mr.

through
its

its
many
trust
officers,
through
its
many

and
it
also
has
sold
this
particular
fund
by
a
mail
flyer
to
the
more
than
2
million
retail
customers,
the

city
bank
--

area.

g.

vieth

does
not
use
other
banks.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
it
--
this
as
we
have
indicated
in
our
reply
brief,
the
first
national
city
bank
typically
advertises
its
trust
department
rather
extensively.
however,
under
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
it
may
not
advertise
the
availability
of
this
fund
except
in
a
very
limited
way
and
in
a
way
that’s
limited
to
all
mutual
funds.
no
mutual
fund
may
advertise
the
availability
or
participations
except
in
the
most
conservative
types
of
tombstone
advertisement.
the
sec
rules
so
require.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
there
are
not
of
its
--
no
sir.
mr.
justice,
the
purpose
of
including
those
was
to
rebut
the
claim
made
by
first
national
city
that
--
the
participations
in
this
fund
would
only
be
offered
in
the
context
of
the
very
conservative
offering
of
the
traditional
fiduciary
services.
as
if
somehow
or
other
that
differentiated
this
fund
from
an
ordinary
mutual
fund.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
an
ordinary
mutual
fund
is
very
strictly
limited
in
the
type
of
advertising
it
can
do.
and
as
the
appendix
illustrates,
appendix
to
our
reply
brief,
a
bank
trust
department
is
under
no
such
limitations
and
we
think
it
was
very
interesting
and
rather
flamboyant
advertising,
and
for
that
reason,
called
it
to
the
intention
of
the
court.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
no
sir.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
it's
an
advertisement
of
the
other
trust
services
offered
by
the
bank.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
as
i've
indicated
--
in
our
view,
the
points
of
similarity
that
we
have
--
that
i
have
just
listed
here,
the
characteristics
of
an
ordinary
mutual
fund
are
and
the
characteristics
of
a
commingled
investment
fund
of
the
city
bank
type
indicate
that
in
sum
and
substance
and
for
all
practical
and
legal
purposes,
they
are
identical.
the
significance
of
that
of
course
is
because
of
the
fact
as
i
indicated
previously
that
it
seems
to
be
conceded
all
around
that
if
in
fact
it
that
were
an
ordinary
garden
variety
mutual
fund
that
bank
under
the
glass-steagall
act
could
not
operate
it,
and
vice
versa
certainly,
a
mutual
fund
could
not
go
into
the
banking
business.
the
federal
reserve
board
has
on
many
occasions,
beginning
in
1941
and
we
have
listed
all
of
them
in
our
brief,
it
has
on
many
occasions
ruled
that
an
ordinary
mutual
fund
is
engaged
in
the
very
activity
that
the
glass-steagall
act
refers
to.
it
has
said
that
the
primary
engagement
of
an
ordinary
mutual
fund
is
in
issuing
and
distributing
securities.
it
said
the
reason
that
is
a
primary
engagement
of
an
ordinary
mutual
fund
is
because
of
this
open-end
feature.
it
must
continue
to
issue
securities
so
as
to
raise
cash
to
take
care
of
redemptions.
now,
it's
true
that
the
federal
reserve
board
rulings
have
been
on
the
section
32
of
the
act,
one
of
the
affiliation
sections.
the
language
of
section
32
refers
to
a
company,
primarily
engaged
in
the
issue
of
securities.
the
federal
reserve
board
has
ruled
that
that
is
what
a
mutual
fund
does.
we
submit
that
a
logical
extension
of
such
rulings
to
section
21
brings
that
kind
of
activity
within
the
language
of
section
21.
the
language
of
section
21
refers
a
company
engaged
in
the
business
of
issuing
securities.
now,
section
21
prohibits
a
bank
from
directly
engaging
in
the
business
of
issuing
securities.
section
32,
prohibits
a
member
bank
from
having
one
or
more
directors
who
are
affiliated
with
companies
that
are
primarily
engaged
in
the
issue
of
securities,
but
if
a
mutual
fund
is
primarily
engaged
in
the
issue
of
securities,
it
is
also
engaged
in
the
business
of
issuing
securities
within
the
meaning
of
section
21.
and
we
submit
that
this
commingled
account
is
primarily
engaged
in
the
issue
of
securities
and
is
also
engaged
in
the
business
of
issuing
securities
and
thereby
the
first
national
city
bank
and
the
other
national
banks
authorized
to
do
this
by
the
comptroller
would
be
engaged
in
the
business
of
issuing
securities
within
the
meaning
of
section
21,
an
activity
which
is
specifically
prohibited
to
them
by
section
21.
i
should
like
to
refer,
if
i
may,
to
the
common
trust
fund
which
has
been
the
discussion
--
as
subject
of
some
discussion
in
the
prior
case,
and
which
was
referred
to
in
the
briefs
and
by
the
court
below.
it
is
true
that
courts
--
that
banks
for
many
years,
national
and
state
banks
have
been
operating
common
trust
funds.
it
is
also
true
that
those
funds
properly
operated
are
exempt
from
the
1940
investment
company
act,
and
it
is
also
true
that
we
do
not
contend
to
the
contrary
that
the
glass-steagall
act
does
not
prohibit
a
national
bank
or
a
state
bank
from
operating
an
ordinary
common
trust
fund.
the
point
is
that
there
are
fundamental
differences
between
the
operation
of
a
common
trust
fund
on
the
one
hand
which
does
not
violate
the
glass-steagall
act,
and
the
operation
of
a
commingled
account
as
is
reflected
in
this
record
by
the
operation
of
the
first
national
city
bank’s
account
on
the
other
hand.
and
those
fundamental
differences
provide
the
facts
upon
which
we
contend
a
violation
of
section
21
of
the
glass-steagall
act
is
to
be
found.
a
common
trust
fund
is
a
tool
or
device
used
by
the
trust
department
of
the
bank
for
the
more
efficient
administration
of
funds
which
are
entrusted
to
the
bank
in
the
ordinary
course
of
its
trust
department
business.
the
initial
impetus
for
common
trust
funds
came
from
the
need
for
more
economical
administration
of
small
trusts
which
came
to
the
bank
in
the
ordinary
course
of
their
business.
to
my
understanding,
that
later
larger
--
the
funds
of
larger
trust
are
also
administered
by
commingling.
but
under
the
normal
operation
of
a
common
trust
fund,
the
funds
are
delivered
to
the
bank
by
the
provision
--
by
virtue
of
the
provisions
of
a
trust
or
some
other
fiduciary
relationship.
after
it
has
received
the
funds,
the
bank
exercises
discretion
to
determine
whether
all
or
any
portion
of
those
funds
should
be
placed
in
one
or
more
the
common
trust
funds,
operated
by
the
bank.
under
no
circumstances,
is
the
common
trust
fund
itself
held
out
to
the
public
as
a
medium
of
investment.
under
no
circumstances
may
participate
in
the
common
trust
fund,
be
offered
or
sold
to
the
public
for
investment
purposes.
the
common
trust
fund
is
merely
a
tool
or
an
aid
to
the
operation,
the
more
efficient
operation
of
the
bank's
trust
department.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
it
is,
if
your
honor
please,
available.
however,
the
distinction
is
that
the
federal
reserve
board
and
the
american
banker’s
association,
and
all
of
the
authorities
involved
and
thus
have
traditionally
imposed
limitations
on
the
manner
in
which
a
common
trust
fund
is
operated,
so
as
not
to
make
it
engaging
in
the
offering
of
securities
in
a
fund.
it
is
true
that
if
a
bank
customer
takes
the
initiative
of
going
into
a
bank
--
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
john
--
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
yes
sir
that
could
be
done.
i
might
say
that
the
federal
reserve
board,
through
the
years
was
always
concerned
about
the
use
of
common
trust
funds
for
interviable’s
trust
and
indeed
in
1960,
promulgated
a
regulation
which
would
have
prohibited
the
use
of
revocable,
interviable’s
trusts
in
common
trust
funds
for
this
very
reason,
because
that
kind
of
use
could
be
abused
and
could
be
become
the
use
of
an
investment
medium.
that
regulation
was
promulgated
for
comment
--
comments
were
issued
and
were
submitted
and
the
hearing
was
held,
but
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
reserve
board
was
transferred
to
the
comptroller
in
1962
before
any
action
was
taken
on
that.
however,
--
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
it
would
indicate
that
interviable’s
trusts
maybe
used,
but
it
would
also
indicate
--
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
well
the
--
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
we
contend
mr.
justice
stewart
that
they
are
different
because
of
the
manner
in
which
the
bank
handles
the
funds.
it’s
true
a
person
with
funds
could
bring
the
funds
into
the
bank
and
could
create
a
trust
relationship.
the
trust
officer
would
then
be
faced
with
the
initial
decision,
shall
i
invest
these
funds
in
a
common
trust
fund
that
we
operate
or
shall
i
administer
to
them
separately?
in
the
case
of
a
commingled
account
and
this
is
the
essence
of
the
difference
in
our
judgment,
in
the
case
of
a
commingled
account,
the
customer
is
shown
a
prospectus
and
is
shown
the
participation
and
there
is
no
this
discretion.
there
is
no
discretion
exercises,
but
instead,
the
money
is
taken
and
automatically
invested
in
the
commingled
account
and
in
that
respect
it
is
identical
to
what
is
done
with
respect
to
a
mutual
fund.
we
submit
that
that
absence
of
a
discretion
is
fundamentally
different
here
and
does
create
the
legal
difference.
i
had
not
mentioned
it
earlier,
but
in
fact,
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
a
sales
flyer
was
sent
by
the
first
national
city
bank
to
its
"valued
customers"
and
the
record
also
indicates
that
there
are
more
that
2
million
retail
customers
of
this
bank.
and
the
sales
flyer
urged
the
customers
to
return
a
check
in
the
amount
of
$10,000.00
or
more,
and
their
name,
address,
and
social
security
number.
that’s
all
the
information
the
bank
would
have
with
respect
to
this
valued
customer.
upon
the
receipt
of
that
check,
a
security
in
the
commingled
account
would
be
issued
in
favor
of
that
customer
and
its
funds
would
be
deposited
in
the
commingled
account.
that
is
entirely
different
from
the
bona
fide
of
fiduciary
purposes
which
have
traditionally
been
required
with
respect
to
the
administration
of
common
trust
funds.
those
limitations
on
common
trust
funds
imposed
both
by
the
bankers
association
and
by
the
federal
reserve
board
are
set
forth
at
pages
8,
9,
and
10
of
our
reply
brief,
the
yellow
document,
and
we
submit
that
that
difference
is
significant.
it
is
a
difference
between
issuing
and
offering
for
sale
securities
on
the
one
hand
and
the
use
of
a
common
trust
fund
for
the
administration
of
funds
which
come
to
the
bank
in
the
normal
course
of
its
trust
business,
and
as
to
which
a
discretion
is
exercised
is
to
whether
the
fund
should
be
placed
in
a
common
trust
fund
or
should
be
administered
in
some
other
fashion.
i
should
also
mention
that
the
respondent’s
in
this
case
in
the
court
below
took
the
position
that
the
units
of
participation
issued
by
a
commingled
account
are
not
securities
within
the
meaning
of
section
21
and
the
other
sections
of
the
glass-steagall
act.
indeed,
the
comptroller’s
entire
argument
in
this
court
based
on
the
language
of
the
statute
rests
upon
this
one
point,
that
somehow
or
other
these
units
of
participation
are
not
securities
within
the
meaning
of
glass-steagall
act,
even
though
a
participating
agreement
or
share
or
an
ordinary
mutual
fund
is
clearly
a
security
within
the
meaning
of
the
glass-steagall
act.
we
submit
at
the
very
breath
of
the
reference
in
the
several
relevant
sections
of
the
glass-steagall
act
to
securities
involved,
requires
rejection
of
any
limited
or
technical
claim
as
to
the
meaning
of
securities
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
section
21
refers
to
stocks,
bonds,
debentures,
notes,
or
other
securities
in
very
broad
and
sweeping
language,
indicating
the
congressional
concern
in
our
judgment
to
include
all
types
of
traditional
securities.
but
the
units
of
participation
that
we’re
talking
about
here
are
ownership
interests
in
an
investment
medium,
a
pool
of
securities
managed
and
operated
for
speculative
investment
purposes,
we
submit
that
such
an
ownership
interest
constitutes
a
security
within
any
reasonable
definition
of
that
term.
i
might
point
out
that
the
respondents
have
offered
no
contrary,
no
substitute
definition
of
the
term
securities
as
it’s
used
in
the
glass-steagall
act.
but
the
fundamental
point
is
that
the
federal
reserve
board
has
ruled
and
this
fact
is
ignored
by
both
of
the
respondents,
the
federal
reserve
board
has
ruled
with
respect
to
this
very
city
bank
fund
that
the
units
of
participations
issued
by
that
fund
are
securities
within
the
meaning
of
the
glass-steagall
act.
the
context
to
that
ruling
was
as
follows.
as
i
have
indicated,
section
32
prohibits
member
banks
from
having
one
or
more
directors
who
are
also
affiliated
with
companies
primarily
engaged
in
the
business
of
issuing
securities.
the
federal
reserve
board
was
asked
to
rule
on
the
question
of
whether
this
city
bank
fund
would
violate
section
32
because
a
director
of
a
member
bank
or
an
officer
of
a
member
bank,
first
national
city
would
also
serve
as
a
member
of
the
committee.
the
board
analyzed
the
facts
as
presented
by
the
first
national
city
and
first
noted
the
contention
of
the
first
national
city
that
the
units
of
participation
were
not
securities
within
the
meaning
of
the
glass-steagall
act.
the
board
rejected
that
contention
and
specifically
found
that
the
units
of
participation
were
securities.
however,
the
board
next
had
to
face
the
question,
is
there
an
interlock
of
the
type
prohibited?
the
board
ruled
that
this
commingled
account
in
the
board's
view
was
merely
an
arm
or
department
of
the
first
national
city
bank.
and
therefore,
that
there
could
be
technically
no
interlock
of
the
kind
prohibited
by
section
32.
if
you
didn’t
have
two
entities
within
the
view
of
the
board,
then
you
couldn’t
have
it
prohibited
interlock.
the
board
went
on
to
note
that
while
section
21,
the
section
upon
which
we
principally
relied
might
have
been
involved
if
traditionally
had
not
issued
opinions
with
respect
to
section
21,
because
that
is
a
criminal
statute.
we
submit,
however,
that
had
the
board
issued
a
ruling
under
section
21,
it
would
have
been
required
by
the
logic
of
its
finding
to
have
concluded
that
the
bank,
if
indeed
this
is
a
single
entity,
that
the
bank
would
be
engaged
in
the
business
of
issuing
and
selling
securities
as
referred
to
in
section
21.
the
board
found
that
the
units
of
participation
were
securities.
the
board
has
repeatedly
found
that
an
ordinary
mutual
fund
in
these
purposes,
this
is
the
same
as
the
ordinary
mutual
fund,
is
primarily
engaged
in
issuing
those
securities
because
of
the
redemption
feature,
the
need
to
raise
cash
to
take
care
of
redemptions.
we
submit
if
the
board
have
not
voluntarily
withheld
jurisdiction
under
section
21,
it
would
have
concluded
that
section
21
is
violated.
i
should
like
--
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
yes
sir,
it
seems
to
be.
that
has
been
a
much
mooted
point.
the
federal
reserve
board
taking
the
position
that
it's
a
single
entity,
securities
and
exchange
commission
taking
the
position
they
are
two
entities,
but
for
our
purposes,
--
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
either
way,
if
it
is
two
entities,
we
submit
the
section
32
is
violated.
if
it
is
single
entity,
we
submit
the
section
21
is
violated.
i
should
like
to
briefly
refer
to
one
additional
matter
that
was
dealt
with
in
the
court
below.
the
court
below
indicated
that
the
essence
and
i’m
referring
to
judge
bazelon’s
concurring
opinion
which
dealt
with
the
merits.
that
the
essence
of
his
holding
was
that
the
securities
dealings
here
involved,
that
is
the
portfolio
dealings,
were
for
the
account
of
customers
and
not
for
the
account
of
the
bank;
meaning
that
no
funds
of
the
bank
were
involved
in
the
dealings
and
therefore
in
his
view,
the
glass-steagall
act
was
not
violated.
this
reflected
a
judgment
on
the
part
of
judge
bazelon,
that
the
glass-steagall
act
was
intended
to
prohibit
only
bank
securities
activities
which
somehow
or
other
endangered
the
assets
of
the
bank
and
the
depositors
in
the
bank.
now,
there
is
no
question,
that
a
reading
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
glass-steagall
act
shows
that
a
principle
concern
of
congress
was
the
fact
that
bank
assets
were
depleted
by
the
speculative
activities
of
the
banks
in
the
1920’s.
but
also,
there
is
no
doubt
from
a
reading
of
the
legislative
history
that
congress
had
many
other
concerns
in
mind
and
a
principle
additional
concern
was
the
concern
that
a
bank,
not
have
anything
to
offer
in
the
line
of
securities,
anything
to
offer
for
sale
to
bank
customers
that
a
customer
of
a
bank
could
rely
upon
the
banker
for
disinterested
advice
with
respect
to
the
purchase
of
securities.
we
submit
that
that
congressional
concern
is
clearly
violated
by
an
account
of
this
kind.
this
bank's
profits
and
any
banks
profit
under
a
commingled
account,
directly
depends
upon
the
selling
of
securities.
the
fee
--
the
management
fee
earned
under
the
investment
advisory
contract,
goes
up
directly
in
accordance
with
the
number
of
participations
that
are
sold
and
as
the
assets
of
the
fund
thereby
increase.
we
submit
that,
that
concern
of
congress
which
was
also
a
principle
concern
in
the
glass-steagall
--
at
the
time
of
the
glass-steagall
act
is
violated
by
these
provisions.
it
is
not
enough
to
say
as
the
court
below
said
that
as
long
as
the
bank's
funds
are
not
involved,
as
long
as
this
is
for
the
account
of
customers
and
not
for
the
account
of
the
bank,
that
there
is
no
violation.
indeed,
we
submit
that
that
is
incorrect
reading
of
the
language
of
section
16
which
i’ve
referred
to
before.
the
language
reading
that
a
bank
may
solely
upon
a
order
and
for
the
account
of
customers
and
not
for
its
own
account,
buy
and
sell
securities
for
the
customer.
we
submit
that
that
language
clearly
indicates
and
the
contemporaneous
authorities
underscore
this,
it
clearly
confers
nothing
more
than
a
limited
power
to
perform
an
accommodation
service
for
individual
customers
on
an
individual
basis.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
trust
powers
of
banks.
that
kind
of
service
can
be
performed
by
any
bank
whether
or
not
it
has
trust
powers.
if
i
may,
i
should
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
it
has
been
our
intention
to
rely
upon
the
standing
arguments
made
in
our
reply
brief,
but
i
would
of
course
be
happy
to
discuss
any
questions
that
the
court
may
wish
to
address
to
me.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
in
our
view
mr.
justice,
this
court’s
decision
recently
in
the
data
processing
case
and
a
subsequent
brief
--
per
curium
order
in
the
arnold
tours
case,
disposes
of
standing
as
an
issue
in
this
proceeding.
as
we
analyze
in
our
reply
brief
filed
on
november
20,
1970,
we
read
the
data
processing
as
eliminating
the
so
called
legal
interest
test
which
had
deviled
courts
and
litigants
for
so
many
years
and
substituting
three
tests
on
the
question
of
standing.
the
first
test
whether
there
is
injury
in
fact
and
indeed
several
members
of
this
court
would
hold
that
injury
in
fact
is
enough.
i
believe
it’s
conceded
all
around
that
we
have
shown
a
case
of
injury
in
fact
here.
the
district
court
found
the
members
of
the
petitioner
of
institute
would
be
irreparably
injured
if
the
comptroller’s
regulation
and
his
specific
authority
were
allowed
to
stand.
the
comptroller
himself
has
predicted
that
billions
of
dollars
will
soon
be
invested
in
bank
--
commingled
accounts
bank,
the
mutual
funds,
if
his
regulation
is
allowed
to
stand.
i
do
not
believe
there
is
any
contention
that
we
do
not
--
we
have
not
shown
injury
in
fact.
a
third
criterion
set
up
by
the
courts
in
data
processing
is
that
the
statute
itself
shall
not
preclude
judicial
review.
here
again,
i
don’t
think
there
can
be
any
claim
that
the
statutes
here
involve
a
national
banking
act
and
the
several
sections
do
preclude
judicial
review
and
i
don’t
understand
the
comptroller
or
anyone
else
in
this
case
to
make
such
a
contention.
that
returns
us
to
the
second
test,
is
--
are
the
plaintiffs
here
arguably
within
the
zone
of
interest
to
be
protected
or
regulated
by
the
statute
in
question?
well
quite
clearly,
the
mutual
funds
who
are
members
of
the
petitioner
institute
are
within
the
zone
of
interests
regulated
by
the
statute
in
question.
indeed,
the
statute
in
question,
namely
section
32,
has
been
applied
repeatedly
to
ordinary
mutual
funds.
on
a
number
of
occasions,
ordinary
mutual
funds
have
petitioned
the
federal
reserve
board
for
the
right
to
include
among
their
unaffiliated
directors.
under
the
investment
company
act,
each
mutual
fund
must
have
a
certain
percentage
of
unaffiliated
directors,
it
is
petitioned
to
federal
reserve
board
for
the
right
to
use
prominent
businessmen
who
are
eminently
qualified
except
for
one
thing,
that
they
are
also
directors
of
member
banks
of
the
federal
reserve
system.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
yes
sir,
but
--
i
wanted
to
point
out
that
even
had
the
justice
would
require
a
continuance
of
that.
the
federal
reserve
board
has
ruled
that
it
is
not.
the
federal
reserve
board
has
ruled
that
under
section
32,
directors
of
member
banks
are
unavailable
to
mutual
funds
as
directors
of
the
mutual
funds.
it
has
repeatedly
so
held
--
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
yes
sir.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
yes
sir.
what
was
involved
in
data
processing
and
arnold
tours
were
claims
that
under
section
16,
data
processing
services
in
the
one
case
and
travel
agency
services
in
the
other
were
not
within
the
incidental
powers
of
banks.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
much
more
clearly
than
in
those
two
cases
in
our
judgment.
in
those
two
cases
--
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
yes
sir.
and
we
have
in
our
judgment
and
in
our
a
fortiori
argument
here
that
congress
has
specifically
spoken
and
said
that
the
bank
should
not
be
engaged
in
the
securities
business.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
well
i
have
potential
--
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
--
mr.
justice
to
analyze
the
three
standards
set
forth
in
the
data
processing
case.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
it
seems
to
that
the
per
curium
order
in
arnold
tours
makes
it
pretty
clear
that
if
an
arguable
case
can
be
made
that
a
particular
activity
is
prohibited
to
banks,
that
one
who
is
engaged
in
that
activity
is
entitled
to
present
that
arguable
case
to
the
courts
for
adjudication.
it
is
arguably
within
the
zone
of
interest.
now
in
our
case,
we’re
not
just
arguably
within
the
zone
of
interest
regulated
by
the
statute,
we
are
in
within
the
zone
of
interest
regulated.
we
are
barred
by
this
statute
from
going
into
the
banking
business.
we
are
specifically
barred
by
section
21
and
in
our
judgment,
we
have
standing
to
challenge.
we
indeed
probably
are
the
only
party
that
would
challenge
the
attempt
by
the
comptroller
to
permit
national
bank’s
to
go
across
the
wall
from
the
other
side.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
mr.
justice
black
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
dwell
just
briefly
on
the
fiduciary
point
that
has
been
emphasized
so
much
in
mr.
cox’s
argument.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
this
commingled
investment
fund,
this
bank
mutual
fund
is
operated
by
the
trust
department
of
a
bank,
in
this
case,
city
bank’s
trust
department
and
this
indeed
is
the
only
such
fund
that
has
come
in
to
being.
but
beyond
that
point,
the
operation
of
this
fund
is
no
more
or
no
less
fiduciary
than
the
operation
of
any
ordinary
mutual
fund,
whether
that
mutual
fund
takes
the
form
of
the
massachusetts
trust
as
some
of
them
do
or
whether
the
fund
is
has
--
they
more
commonly
are
a
corporation.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
much
of
the
argument
seems
to
suggest
the
original
comptrollers’
intention
with
respect
to
regulation
9
which
intention
was
abandoned
when
the
comptroller
approved
city
banks’
fund
and
said
that
he
would
amend
regulation
9
to
permit
all
other
funds
like
city
banks
to
be
operated.
the
comptroller
originally
indicated
in
1963
with
respect
to
his
first
regulation
and
his
report
is
quoted
on
pages
2
and
3
of
our
reply
brief,
that
such
a
fund
may
not
engage
in
the
selling
of
interests
and
pool
funds.
accordingly,
there
may
be
no
agreement
between
the
bank
and
the
customer
that
the
latter’s
funds
will
be
invested
in
collective
investment
funds,
nor
may
managing
an
agency
contracts
be
operated
or
hailed
out
as
interest
in
a
collective
investment
fund.
now,
every
one
of
the
things
mentioned
by
the
comptroller
there
is
directly
contrary
to
what
is
being
done
in
connection
with
the
city
bank
fund.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
he
had
perhaps
in
mind
the
same
sort
of
thing
as
a
common
trust
fund
where
the
bank
does
in
the
normal
course
obtain
funds
and
then
exercises
a
discretion
as
to
whether
the
fund
should
be
administered
individually
or
whether
perhaps
it
might
be
more
economical
or
more
efficient
to
invest
them
in
a
commingled
fund.
he
had
that
in
mind
with
respect
to
these.
but
this
city
bank
fund
fails
on
every
one
of
those
tests.
here,
the
arrangement
provides
for
the
automatic
investment
of
the
participant’s
funds
into
the
commingled
fund,
and
the
managing
agency
contract
in
the
fund
is
itself
held
out
as
an
investment
trust.
indeed,
it
is
in
those
points
mentioned
by
the
comptroller
in
1963
which
he
abandoned
during
the
course
of
permitting
the
city
banks’
fund
to
operate
in
accordance
with
his
ruling
in
1965,
it
is
--
those
very
points
that
distinguish
this
kind
of
a
fund
from
the
common
trust
fund
that
we
discussed
a
bit
--
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
section
32
prohibits
such
an
affiliation
between
a
member
bank
--
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
well,
it’s
the
interpretation
of
the
federal
reserve
board
that
section
32
which
prohibits
such
an
affiliation
with
the
company
or
a
man
affiliated
with
the
company
primarily
engaged
in
the
issuance
of
securities
and
the
federal
reserve
board
has
held
repeatedly
that
an
ordinary
open-end
mutual
fund
is
primarily
engaged
in
the
issuance
of
securities
within
the
meaning
of
section
32.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
because
of
the
inherent
conflicts
of
interest
that
congress
determined
in
the
association
between
security
affiliates
on
the
one
hand
and
banks
on
the
other
hand,
and
that
raises
the
point
mr.
justice
white
if
i
may
comment
upon
it
with
respect
to
the
argument
both
by
the
comptroller
and
mr.
cox,
that
somehow
or
rather
the
legislative
history
of
the
glass-steagall
act
indicates
that
all
congress
was
concerned
with
was
separating
the
investment
banking
from
commercial
banking.
congress
clearly
was
concerned
in
doing
that.
we
don’t
deny
that,
but
it
had
many
other
concerns
and
one
of
the
concerns
was
to
eliminate
any
possibility
of
direct
engagement
or
affiliation
with
companies
that
are
primarily
engaged
in
issuing
and
selling
securities,
whether
as
investment
bankers
or
not.
that
a
mutual
fund
under
no
circumstances
is
even
remotely
akin
to
investment
banking,
and
yet
the
federal
reserve
board
has
repeatedly
held
that
a
mutual
fund
is
engaged
in
the
kind
of
activity
that
congress
wanted
to
prohibit
to
banks
directly
or
through
affiliates
in
the
glass-steagall
act.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
mr.
justice
white
as
i
indicated
in
my
earlier
argument,
the
federal
reserve
board
looked
at
this
particular
fund
and
this
particular
relationship,
in
our
judgment,
a
reading
of
that,
the
decision
would
indicate
that
they
would
have
held
the
relationship
unlawful,
but
for
their
holding.
that
they
were
not
the
two
entities
and
therefore
there
could
not
be
the
interlock.
that
is
the
sole
basis
for
their
holding.
now,
with
respect
to
this
question
that
has
been
repeatedly
been
urged
here
that
this
is
a
mere
modest
extension
of
common
trust
fund
activities,
in
particular
with
a
respect
to
a
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
stewart
this
morning
with
respect
to
setting
up
trusts,
interviable
trusts
specifically
for
investment
in
common
trust
funds.
the
federal
reserve
board
through
the
years
and
the
banker’s
manuals
have
repeatedly
urged
against
that
kind
of
a
situation.
indeed,
we
cite
in
our
reply
brief
a
ruling
on
page
10
of
our
reply
brief
where
the
federal
reserve
board
that
dealt
with
the
very
similar
situation.
in
that
case,
a
corporation,
this
ruling
appears
in
the
september,
1947
bulletin
of
the
federal
reserve
board,
in
that
case,
a
corporation
which
wished
to
place
certain
funds
to
establish
a
trust
so
that
they
could
place
those
funds
in
the
bank’s
common
trust
fund,
and
the
board
ruled
and
i
quote
from
the
1947
bulletin,
“under
the
facts
presented,
it
appears
that
there
is
no
reason
for
the
creation
of
the
trust
other
than
the
desire
of
the
corporation
to
invest
its
funds
in
participations
in
the
common
trust
fund.”
the
trust
merely
is
a
mechanism
designed
to
enable
the
corporation
to
acquire
such
participations
in
lieu
of
other
investments.
the
analogy
with
the
purchase
of
investment
trust
certificates
is
apparent
and
the
use
of
a
common
trust
fund
for
this
purpose
amongst
substance
to
the
operation
of
the
fund
is
an
ordinary
investment
trust.
common
trust
funds
were
not
permitted
for
that
purpose,
we
submit,
because
the
glass-steagall
act
would
be
violated
by
such
operation
of
a
common
trust
fund
and
we
similarly
submit
that
this
commingled
fund
violates
glass-steagall.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
no
sir.
common
trust
funds
to
this
day
are
not
permitted
to
be
operated
in
that
fashion.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
yes,
sir.
if
you
come
in
to
the
bank
and
the
bank
makes
no
attempt
to
sell
you
a
certificate
in
the
common
trust
fund,
takes
your
funds,
makes
the
judgment
as
to
whether
your
funds
should
be
appropriately
be
put
in
the
bank.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
no,
sir.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case,
the
broad
issue,
is
whether
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
has
authority
to
permit
national
banks
to
operate
commingled
investment
funds
for
managing
agency
accounts
such
as
the
fund
involved
in
no.59,
which
just
been
argued.
notwithstanding
the
provisions
of
the
1933
glass-steagall
legislation
as
amended.
however,
since
it
appears
to
be
conceded
all
around
that
the
ordinary
open-end
mutual
fund
which
i
shall
describe
in
just
a
moment,
is
prohibited
by
the
glass-steagall
legislation
from
engaging
in
the
banking
business
and
conversely
that
banks
are
prohibited
from
operating
garden
variety
or
traditional
open-end
mutual
funds.
the
narrow
issue
before
the
court,
we
submit,
is
whether
in
sum
and
substance,
a
commingled
investment
account
of
the
kind
that
has
been
discussed
in
the
last
case
in
which
will
be
discussed
in
this
case,
whether
such
an
account
is
in
sum
and
substance
an
ordinary
open-end
mutual
fund.
the
petitioners
in
this
case
of
the
investment
company
institute
which
represents
most
of
the
mutual
funds
or
open-end
investment
companies
in
the
united
states,
and
the
number
of
individual
members
of
that
institute.
the
action
was
brought
in
the
district
court
against
the
comptroller
of
the
currency,
asserting
that
his
regulation,
9.18,
which
purported
to
permit
this
type
of
activity,
was
unlawful
because
it
violated
the
glass-steagall
act.
and
also
because
it
permitted
activity
in
excess
of
the
trust
powers
which
the
comptroller
is
authorized
to
grant
national
banks
under
section
92
(a)
of
the
national
banking
act.
the
district
court
found
that
the
regulations
were
invalid
on
both
contentions.
the
matter
was
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
on
both
matters.
first,
i
should
like
to
briefly
summarize
the
four
sections
of
the
glass-steagall
act
of
1933,
which
we
believe
are
applicable
to
this
case.
the
court
will
recall
that
the
glass-steagall
legislation
was
passed
in
1933
and
was
prompted
by
the
almost
complete
breakdown
of
this
nation’s
major
financial
institutions
during
the
late
1920’s.
a
number
of
reforms
in
the
national
banking
legislation
which
are
today
accepted
as
common
place
such
as
the
insurance
by
the
federal
deposit
insurance
company
of
national
bank
deposits
and
state
banks'
deposits,
and
other
banking
provisions
were
adopted
in
the
glass-steagall
legislation.
however,
the
central
purpose
of
glass-steagall
was
to
eliminate
the
inherent
conflicts
of
interest
which
are
present
in
the
conduct
by
the
same
entity
or
closely
affiliated
entities
of
the
business
of
commercial
banking
on
the
one
hand,
the
business
of
receiving
deposits.
subject
to
demand,
the
activity
of
commercial
banking
on
the
one
hand
and
the
securities
business,
the
business
of
investment
banking
or
the
business
of
issuing,
selling,
distributing,
and
underwriting
securities
on
the
other
hand.
and
there
were
as
i
say
four
central
provisions
designed
to
accomplish
this
purpose.
the
keystone
provision
is
section
21,
12
u.s.c.,
section
378.
now,
unlike
the
other
sections
that
are
involved
in
this
case,
some
of
which
apply
only
to
national
banks
and
some
of
which
apply
only
to
banks
which
are
members
of
the
federal
reserve
system,
and
i
might
mention
that
all
national
banks
are
members
of
that
federal
reserve
system,
they
are,
however,
most
of
the
banks
in
the
united
states
are
state
banks
which
are
not
members
of
the
federal
reserve
system,
but
unlike
those
other
sections,
section
21
applies
to
all
banks,
state
or
national,
members
or
not
members
of
the
federal
reserve
system.
in
the
broadest
possible
language,
section
21
requires
the
complete
divorce
of
the
business
of
commercial
banking
from
the
business
--
from
the
securities
business.
it
prohibits
the
simultaneous
engagement
in
the
business
of
receiving
deposits
subject
to
withdrawal
by
check
or
other
means,
which
namely
is
the
business
of
commercial
banking
and
engaging
at
the
same
time
in
the
business
of
issuing
or
underwriting,
or
selling,
or
distributing
stocks,
bonds,
debentures,
notes,
or
other
securities.
section
16
of
the
national
banking
act
is
also
relevant.
it
however
applies
only
to
national
banks
and
indeed
is
the
provision
of
the
national
banking
act
which
sets
forth
the
corporate
powers
of
the
national
banks.
in
doing
so,
it
enacted
two
limitations
or
--
i
beg
pardon,
two
exemptions
to
the
broad
provisions
of
the
other
provisions
of
the
glass-steagall
act.
it
did
first
permit
and
authorized
national
banks
to
underwrite
and
sell
a
strictly
limited
list
of
government
bonds.
and
secondly,
it
expressly
confirmed
the
right
of
all
national
banks,
whether
or
not
they
exercised
trust
powers,
to
perform
an
accommodation
service
for
customers
by
permitting
banks
to
purchase
some
sale
securities
solely
upon
the
order
and
for
the
account
of
customers,
and
not
for
the
account
of
the
bank.
i
refer
to
this
is
an
accommodation
service.
the
legislative
history
makes
it
clear
and
become
contemporaneous
publications
of
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
in
1933
and
1934
make
it
clear
that
this
service
was
intended
for
the
smaller
banks
located
in
smaller
communities
where
the
ordinary
services
of
the
broker
dealer
were
not
available.
that
situation
may
not
prevail
to
a
great
extent
today,
but
certainly
in
1933,
there
were
many
communities
where
the
banker
was
the
only
man
who
could
buy
or
sell
a
security
solely
upon
an
order
and
for
the
account
of
the
customer,
that
was
the
second
exception
permitted
by
section
16.
however,
in
granting
these
two
very
limited
exceptions,
congress
made
it
clear
in
section
16
once
again
that
a
broad
prohibition
of
--
a
broad
repeal
of
the
prohibitions
of
section
21
were
not
intended
because
section
16
specifically
says
that
a
bank
may
not
underwrite
any
issue
of
securities
or
stock.
the
third
provision
applicable
here,
section
32
and
also
i
should
refer
to
section
20.
these
two
sections
were
intended
to
prevent
the
violation
of
the
prohibitions
of
section
21
through
the--
indirectly,
through
the
use
of
affiliations
or
interlocks.
section
32
which
applies
only
to
member
banks
provides
that
no
person
affiliated
with
a
company
primarily
engaged
in
the
issue
or
floatation,
underwriting,
public
sell
or
distribution
of
securities
may
serve
at
the
same
time
as
an
officer
or
director
or
employee
of
a
member
bank.
section
20
prohibited
certain
defined
affiliations
between
member
banks
on
the
one
hand
and
corporations
engaged
principally
in
the
issue
of
floatation,
underwriting
and
so
forth
of
stocks
and
bonds.
and
so
sections
32
and
20
were
intended
to
prohibit
indirect
violations
of
the
broad
prohibition
of
section
21.
now
as
i
have
previously
indicated,
we
believe
that
the
narrow
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
a
bank
commingled
investment
fund
of
the
type
here
under
consideration
is
in
sum
and
substance
a
mutual
fund.
it
has
been
repeatedly
held
by
the
federal
reserve
board
that
a
traditional
mutual
fund
is
subject
to
the
glass-steagall
act.
that
the
activity
of
a
traditional
mutual
fund
is
the
kind
of
activity
contemplated
by
the
glass-steagall
act.
and
this
fact
seems
to
be
conceded
all
around.
it
seems
to
be
conceded
that
a
bank
as
i
say
may
not
operate
a
traditional
mutual
fund,
nor
may
a
traditional
mutual
fund
go
into
the
banking
business.
so
then
we
come
to
the
question,
is
there
a
significant
difference
between
this
fund
and
a
traditional
mutual
fund,
or
are
they
as
we
contend
in
sum
and
substance,
the
very
same
thing.
i
think
in
order
to
demonstrate
this
point
with
clarity,
i
should
like
to
stress
several
of
the
characteristics
of
traditional
mutual
funds
and
demonstrate
how
the
commingled
investment
fund,
typified
by
the
city
bank
fund
before
the
court
are
in
sum
and
substance,
the
same
thing
as
a
matter
of
law.
a
traditional
mutual
fund
typically
is
corporate
in
form.
however,
there
are
many
traditional
mutual
funds
that
are
non-corporate
entities
such
as
trusts
or
other
business
associations.
a
traditional
mutual
fund
is
continually
issuing
participations
or
ownership
interests
in
the
funds.
they
are
frequently
called
shares
of
common
stock
because
a
traditional
mutual
fund
is
typically
or
frequently
a
corporation,
but
mutual
fund
shares
of
the
garden
variety
type
also
have
a
variety
of
other
names,
such
as
beneficial
interests,
participate
in
agreements
and
the
like.
now,
in
the
case
of
the
commingled
investment
fund
of
the
national
city
bank,
their
ownership
interests
or
participations
are
called
“units
of
participation,”
very
similar
to
the
participating
agreements
that
are
issued
by
some
traditional
mutual
funds.
also
in
the
case
of
the
city
bank’s
fund,
it
is
not
a
corporate
entity,
but
it
is
a
separate
entity
and
has
been
so
recognized
and
is
registered
under
the
investment
company
act,
as
has
been
indicated
in
the
prior
case.
the
ownership
interests
or
participations
in
an
ordinary
and
open-end
mutual
fund,
maybe
issued
subject
to
a
sales
charge
or
they
may
be
issued
on
a
so
called
no
load
basis,
where
no
sales
charge
is
exacted.
the
ownership
interests
in
the
bank
commingled
fund
of
the
city
bank
type
are
sold
on
this
no
load
basis.
an
ordinary
mutual
fund
typically
invests
and
reinvests
the
proceeds
from
the
sale
of
the
securities
in
the
fund
in
the
portfolio
securities
in
accordance
with
the
investment
policy
stated
for
the
fund.
the
bank
mutual
fund
of
the
kind
that
we
have
under
consideration
here
does
exactly
the
same
thing.
it
has
adopted
an
investment
policy.
it
sells
the
securities
in
the
fund
and
invests
the
proceeds
of
those
securities
in
accordance
with
the
stated
investment
policy.
the
securities
issued
by
the
ordinary
mutual
fund
are
not
traded
back
and
forth
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange
or
any
stock
exchange
in
the
ordinary
course,
nor
they
are
traded
in
the
over
the
counter
market.
rather
an
investor
in
an
ordinary
mutual
fund
who
desires
to
get
his
money
merely
turns
the
--
his
certificate
into
the
fund
and
it
is
redeemed
in
cash
for
its
asset
value.
indeed,
that
is
the
hallmark
of
an
open-end
investment
company,
the
right
at
any
time
to
redeem
your
investment
for
cash.
the
same
privilege
is
available
in
exactly
the
same
form
to
the
investor,
the
purchaser
of
the
security
in
the
city
bank,
commingled
investment
fund.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
he
may
do
that.
as
the
record
in
this
case
shows,
it
is
virtually
never
done,
mr.
justice.
there
is
virtually
no
trading
in
the
shares
or
participations
in
the
ordinary
--
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
in
this
kind
of
a
fund
as
i
understand
it,
under
the
--
it
is
not
prohibited
by
the
comptroller’s
regulation,
but
by
the
particular
fund.
the
city
bank
fund
does
not
permit
that
kind
of
trading.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
now
in
order
to
facilitate
this
right
of
redemption
that
i
have
referred
to,
an
ordinary
mutual
fund
values
the
assets
of
its
portfolio
regularly,
usually
twice
daily
and
now
as
required
under
sec
regulations
to
do
so
twice
daily
and
the
same
kind
of
evaluation
takes
place
with
respect
to
this
first
national
city
fund.
it
is
valued
--
the
assets
were
valued
as
often
as
necessary
so
as
to
facilitate
this
right
of
redemption.
and
because
of
this
right
of
redemption,
the
hallmark
as
i
say
of
an
open-end
fund,
there
is
continual
pressure
upon
the
operator
of
any
such
fund
to
sell
new
securities
because
regularly,
people
are
redeeming
their
investment
and
asking
for
their
money
back.
and
the
assets
of
the
fund
would
naturally
shrink
unless
there
are
continual
new
sales
so
as
to
provide
new
money
for
the
purpose
of
handling
these
redemptions.
and
the
same
pressures
are
present
with
respect
to
this
bank's
commingled
fund.
i
might
mention
that
those
pressures
were
referred
to
by
the
federal
reserve
board
in
many
rulings
in
which
it
is
held
that
the
ordinary
mutual
fund
is
primarily
engaged
in
issuing
and
selling
securities.
it
must
be
so
primarily
engage
says
the
federal
reserve
board
because
it
is
under
constant
pressure
to
raise
new
cash
to
handle
redemptions.
indeed,
the
record
of
this
--
in
this
case
contains
an
affidavit
by
a
vice
president
of
the
first
national
city
bank
respecting
the
bank
commingled
fund,
the
city
bank's
funds,
in
which
that
official
states
that
if
new
participations
were
not
taken
in
from
to
time
in
the
city
bank
fund,
the
commingled
account
as
it
is
called,
would
inevitably
shrink
in
size
as
a
result
to
withdrawals,
again,
a
point
of
direct
similarity
between
that
from
in
the
traditional
mutual
fund.
a
traditional
mutual
fund
is
typically
controlled
ultimately
by
a
governing
board
such
as
the
board
of
directors
or
board
of
trustees.
and
as
we
have
heard,
the
board
of
directors
of
first
national
fund
is
called
a
committee,
but
it
operates
in
exactly
the
same
fashion
as
a
board
of
directors
or
board
of
trustees.
now
in
an
ordinary
mutual
fund,
the
day-to-day
management
including
the
advices
to
the
purchase
and
sale
of
the
portfolio
securities
is
typically
provided
by
an
investment
advisor
pursuant
to
an
investment
advisory
contract,
and
the
same
thing
is
true
here.
first
national
city
bank
acts
as
an
investment
advisor
to
that
commingled
account
and
it
provides
the
day-to-day
management
services,
and
the
investment
advice,
and
it
does
so
pursuant
to
an
investment
advisory
contract.
a
traditional
mutual
fund
typically
has
a
contract
with
the
principle
underwriter
who
handles
the
sale
of
the
securities
or
participations
in
the
mutual
fund.
again,
first
national
city
bank
has
executed
the
contract
with
its
commingled
account
under
which
it
agrees
to
act
as
principle
underwriter
and
is
responsible
for
the
sale
of
the
securities
in
that
fund.
in
both
cases,
the
funds
are
registered
as
investment
companies
under
the
investment
company
act
of
1940
as
we
have
seen.
in
both
cases,
the
participations
or
shares
in
the
fund
are
registered
with
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
as
securities
under
the
securities
act
of
1933.
in
both
cases,
the
pool
fund
itself
is
held
out
to
the
public
as
an
investment
medium.
and
in
both
cases,
the
essence
is
that
the
pool
of
securities,
purchased
with
the
money
derived
from
the
sale
of
participation
is
used
to
buy
and
sell
securities
in
the
fund's
portfolio
--

me.

mr.

through
its
own
employees,
its
many
trust
officers,
through
its
many
branches
and
it
also
has
sold
this
particular
fund
by
a
mail
flyer
to
the
more
than
2
million
retail
customers,
the
first
city
national
city
bank
--
mr.
g.

vieth
no
sir.
its
sales
officers
are
only
it
its
main
office
and
its
many
branches
throughout
the
new
york
metropolitan
area.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
it
does
not
use
other
banks.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
it
--
this
as
we
have
indicated
in
our
reply
brief,
the
first
national
city
bank
typically
advertises
its
trust
department
rather
extensively.
however,
under
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
it
may
not
advertise
the
availability
of
this
fund
except
in
a
very
limited
way
and
in
a
way
that’s
limited
to
all
mutual
funds.
no
mutual
fund
may
advertise
the
availability
or
participations
except
in
the
most
conservative
types
of
tombstone
advertisement.
the
sec
rules
so
require.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
there
are
not
of
its
--
no
sir.
mr.
justice,
the
purpose
of
including
those
was
to
rebut
the
claim
made
by
first
national
city
that
--
the
participations
in
this
fund
would
only
be
offered
in
the
context
of
the
very
conservative
offering
of
the
traditional
fiduciary
services.
as
if
somehow
or
other
that
differentiated
this
fund
from
an
ordinary
mutual
fund.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
an
ordinary
mutual
fund
is
very
strictly
limited
in
the
type
of
advertising
it
can
do.
and
as
the
appendix
illustrates,
appendix
to
our
reply
brief,
a
bank
trust
department
is
under
no
such
limitations
and
we
think
it
was
very
interesting
and
rather
flamboyant
advertising,
and
for
that
reason,
called
it
to
the
intention
of
the
court.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
no
sir.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
it's
an
advertisement
of
the
other
trust
services
offered
by
the
bank.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
as
i've
indicated
--
in
our
view,
the
points
of
similarity
that
we
have
--
that
i
have
just
listed
here,
the
characteristics
of
an
ordinary
mutual
fund
are
and
the
characteristics
of
a
commingled
investment
fund
of
the
city
bank
type
indicate
that
in
sum
and
substance
and
for
all
practical
and
legal
purposes,
they
are
identical.
the
significance
of
that
of
course
is
because
of
the
fact
as
i
indicated
previously
that
it
seems
to
be
conceded
all
around
that
if
in
fact
it
that
were
an
ordinary
garden
variety
mutual
fund
that
bank
under
the
glass-steagall
act
could
not
operate
it,
and
vice
versa
certainly,
a
mutual
fund
could
not
go
into
the
banking
business.
the
federal
reserve
board
has
on
many
occasions,
beginning
in
1941
and
we
have
listed
all
of
them
in
our
brief,
it
has
on
many
occasions
ruled
that
an
ordinary
mutual
fund
is
engaged
in
the
very
activity
that
the
glass-steagall
act
refers
to.
it
has
said
that
the
primary
engagement
of
an
ordinary
mutual
fund
is
in
issuing
and
distributing
securities.
it
said
the
reason
that
is
a
primary
engagement
of
an
ordinary
mutual
fund
is
because
of
this
open-end
feature.
it
must
continue
to
issue
securities
so
as
to
raise
cash
to
take
care
of
redemptions.
now,
it's
true
that
the
federal
reserve
board
rulings
have
been
on
the
section
32
of
the
act,
one
of
the
affiliation
sections.
the
language
of
section
32
refers
to
a
company,
primarily
engaged
in
the
issue
of
securities.
the
federal
reserve
board
has
ruled
that
that
is
what
a
mutual
fund
does.
we
submit
that
a
logical
extension
of
such
rulings
to
section
21
brings
that
kind
of
activity
within
the
language
of
section
21.
the
language
of
section
21
refers
a
company
engaged
in
the
business
of
issuing
securities.
now,
section
21
prohibits
a
bank
from
directly
engaging
in
the
business
of
issuing
securities.
section
32,
prohibits
a
member
bank
from
having
one
or
more
directors
who
are
affiliated
with
companies
that
are
primarily
engaged
in
the
issue
of
securities,
but
if
a
mutual
fund
is
primarily
engaged
in
the
issue
of
securities,
it
is
also
engaged
in
the
business
of
issuing
securities
within
the
meaning
of
section
21.
and
we
submit
that
this
commingled
account
is
primarily
engaged
in
the
issue
of
securities
and
is
also
engaged
in
the
business
of
issuing
securities
and
thereby
the
first
national
city
bank
and
the
other
national
banks
authorized
to
do
this
by
the
comptroller
would
be
engaged
in
the
business
of
issuing
securities
within
the
meaning
of
section
21,
an
activity
which
is
specifically
prohibited
to
them
by
section
21.
i
should
like
to
refer,
if
i
may,
to
the
common
trust
fund
which
has
been
the
discussion
--
as
subject
of
some
discussion
in
the
prior
case,
and
which
was
referred
to
in
the
briefs
and
by
the
court
below.
it
is
true
that
courts
--
that
banks
for
many
years,
national
and
state
banks
have
been
operating
common
trust
funds.
it
is
also
true
that
those
funds
properly
operated
are
exempt
from
the
1940
investment
company
act,
and
it
is
also
true
that
we
do
not
contend
to
the
contrary
that
the
glass-steagall
act
does
not
prohibit
a
national
bank
or
a
state
bank
from
operating
an
ordinary
common
trust
fund.
the
point
is
that
there
are
fundamental
differences
between
the
operation
of
a
common
trust
fund
on
the
one
hand
which
does
not
violate
the
glass-steagall
act,
and
the
operation
of
a
commingled
account
as
is
reflected
in
this
record
by
the
operation
of
the
first
national
city
bank’s
account
on
the
other
hand.
and
those
fundamental
differences
provide
the
facts
upon
which
we
contend
a
violation
of
section
21
of
the
glass-steagall
act
is
to
be
found.
a
common
trust
fund
is
a
tool
or
device
used
by
the
trust
department
of
the
bank
for
the
more
efficient
administration
of
funds
which
are
entrusted
to
the
bank
in
the
ordinary
course
of
its
trust
department
business.
the
initial
impetus
for
common
trust
funds
came
from
the
need
for
more
economical
administration
of
small
trusts
which
came
to
the
bank
in
the
ordinary
course
of
their
business.
to
my
understanding,
that
later
larger
--
the
funds
of
larger
trust
are
also
administered
by
commingling.
but
under
the
normal
operation
of
a
common
trust
fund,
the
funds
are
delivered
to
the
bank
by
the
provision
--
by
virtue
of
the
provisions
of
a
trust
or
some
other
fiduciary
relationship.
after
it
has
received
the
funds,
the
bank
exercises
discretion
to
determine
whether
all
or
any
portion
of
those
funds
should
be
placed
in
one
or
more
the
common
trust
funds,
operated
by
the
bank.
under
no
circumstances,
is
the
common
trust
fund
itself
held
out
to
the
public
as
a
medium
of
investment.
under
no
circumstances
may
participate
in
the
common
trust
fund,
be
offered
or
sold
to
the
public
for
investment
purposes.
the
common
trust
fund
is
merely
a
tool
or
an
aid
to
the
operation,
the
more
efficient
operation
of
the
bank's
trust
department.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
it
is,
if
your
honor
please,
available.
however,
the
distinction
is
that
the
federal
reserve
board
and
the
american
banker’s
association,
and
all
of
the
authorities
involved
and
thus
have
traditionally
imposed
limitations
on
the
manner
in
which
a
common
trust
fund
is
operated,
so
as
not
to
make
it
engaging
in
the
offering
of
securities
in
a
fund.
it
is
true
that
if
a
bank
customer
takes
the
initiative
of
going
into
a
bank
--
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
john
--
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
yes
sir
that
could
be
done.
i
might
say
that
the
federal
reserve
board,
through
the
years
was
always
concerned
about
the
use
of
common
trust
funds
for
interviable’s
trust
and
indeed
in
1960,
promulgated
a
regulation
which
would
have
prohibited
the
use
of
revocable,
interviable’s
trusts
in
common
trust
funds
for
this
very
reason,
because
that
kind
of
use
could
be
abused
and
could
be
become
the
use
of
an
investment
medium.
that
regulation
was
promulgated
for
comment
--
comments
were
issued
and
were
submitted
and
the
hearing
was
held,
but
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
reserve
board
was
transferred
to
the
comptroller
in
1962
before
any
action
was
taken
on
that.
however,
--
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
it
would
indicate
that
interviable’s
trusts
maybe
used,
but
it
would
also
indicate
--
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
well
the
--
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
we
contend
mr.
justice
stewart
that
they
are
different
because
of
the
manner
in
which
the
bank
handles
the
funds.
it’s
true
a
person
with
funds
could
bring
the
funds
into
the
bank
and
could
create
a
trust
relationship.
the
trust
officer
would
then
be
faced
with
the
initial
decision,
shall
i
invest
these
funds
in
a
common
trust
fund
that
we
operate
or
shall
i
administer
to
them
separately?
in
the
case
of
a
commingled
account
and
this
is
the
essence
of
the
difference
in
our
judgment,
in
the
case
of
a
commingled
account,
the
customer
is
shown
a
prospectus
and
is
shown
the
participation
and
there
is
no
this
discretion.
there
is
no
discretion
exercises,
but
instead,
the
money
is
taken
and
automatically
invested
in
the
commingled
account
and
in
that
respect
it
is
identical
to
what
is
done
with
respect
to
a
mutual
fund.
we
submit
that
that
absence
of
a
discretion
is
fundamentally
different
here
and
does
create
the
legal
difference.
i
had
not
mentioned
it
earlier,
but
in
fact,
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
a
sales
flyer
was
sent
by
the
first
national
city
bank
to
its
"valued
customers"
and
the
record
also
indicates
that
there
are
more
that
2
million
retail
customers
of
this
bank.
and
the
sales
flyer
urged
the
customers
to
return
a
check
in
the
amount
of
$10,000.00
or
more,
and
their
name,
address,
and
social
security
number.
that’s
all
the
information
the
bank
would
have
with
respect
to
this
valued
customer.
upon
the
receipt
of
that
check,
a
security
in
the
commingled
account
would
be
issued
in
favor
of
that
customer
and
its
funds
would
be
deposited
in
the
commingled
account.
that
is
entirely
different
from
the
bona
fide
of
fiduciary
purposes
which
have
traditionally
been
required
with
respect
to
the
administration
of
common
trust
funds.
those
limitations
on
common
trust
funds
imposed
both
by
the
bankers
association
and
by
the
federal
reserve
board
are
set
forth
at
pages
8,
9,
and
10
of
our
reply
brief,
the
yellow
document,
and
we
submit
that
that
difference
is
significant.
it
is
a
difference
between
issuing
and
offering
for
sale
securities
on
the
one
hand
and
the
use
of
a
common
trust
fund
for
the
administration
of
funds
which
come
to
the
bank
in
the
normal
course
of
its
trust
business,
and
as
to
which
a
discretion
is
exercised
is
to
whether
the
fund
should
be
placed
in
a
common
trust
fund
or
should
be
administered
in
some
other
fashion.
i
should
also
mention
that
the
respondent’s
in
this
case
in
the
court
below
took
the
position
that
the
units
of
participation
issued
by
a
commingled
account
are
not
securities
within
the
meaning
of
section
21
and
the
other
sections
of
the
glass-steagall
act.
indeed,
the
comptroller’s
entire
argument
in
this
court
based
on
the
language
of
the
statute
rests
upon
this
one
point,
that
somehow
or
other
these
units
of
participation
are
not
securities
within
the
meaning
of
glass-steagall
act,
even
though
a
participating
agreement
or
share
or
an
ordinary
mutual
fund
is
clearly
a
security
within
the
meaning
of
the
glass-steagall
act.
we
submit
at
the
very
breath
of
the
reference
in
the
several
relevant
sections
of
the
glass-steagall
act
to
securities
involved,
requires
rejection
of
any
limited
or
technical
claim
as
to
the
meaning
of
securities
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
section
21
refers
to
stocks,
bonds,
debentures,
notes,
or
other
securities
in
very
broad
and
sweeping
language,
indicating
the
congressional
concern
in
our
judgment
to
include
all
types
of
traditional
securities.
but
the
units
of
participation
that
we’re
talking
about
here
are
ownership
interests
in
an
investment
medium,
a
pool
of
securities
managed
and
operated
for
speculative
investment
purposes,
we
submit
that
such
an
ownership
interest
constitutes
a
security
within
any
reasonable
definition
of
that
term.
i
might
point
out
that
the
respondents
have
offered
no
contrary,
no
substitute
definition
of
the
term
securities
as
it’s
used
in
the
glass-steagall
act.
but
the
fundamental
point
is
that
the
federal
reserve
board
has
ruled
and
this
fact
is
ignored
by
both
of
the
respondents,
the
federal
reserve
board
has
ruled
with
respect
to
this
very
city
bank
fund
that
the
units
of
participations
issued
by
that
fund
are
securities
within
the
meaning
of
the
glass-steagall
act.
the
context
to
that
ruling
was
as
follows.
as
i
have
indicated,
section
32
prohibits
member
banks
from
having
one
or
more
directors
who
are
also
affiliated
with
companies
primarily
engaged
in
the
business
of
issuing
securities.
the
federal
reserve
board
was
asked
to
rule
on
the
question
of
whether
this
city
bank
fund
would
violate
section
32
because
a
director
of
a
member
bank
or
an
officer
of
a
member
bank,
first
national
city
would
also
serve
as
a
member
of
the
committee.
the
board
analyzed
the
facts
as
presented
by
the
first
national
city
and
first
noted
the
contention
of
the
first
national
city
that
the
units
of
participation
were
not
securities
within
the
meaning
of
the
glass-steagall
act.
the
board
rejected
that
contention
and
specifically
found
that
the
units
of
participation
were
securities.
however,
the
board
next
had
to
face
the
question,
is
there
an
interlock
of
the
type
prohibited?
the
board
ruled
that
this
commingled
account
in
the
board's
view
was
merely
an
arm
or
department
of
the
first
national
city
bank.
and
therefore,
that
there
could
be
technically
no
interlock
of
the
kind
prohibited
by
section
32.
if
you
didn’t
have
two
entities
within
the
view
of
the
board,
then
you
couldn’t
have
it
prohibited
interlock.
the
board
went
on
to
note
that
while
section
21,
the
section
upon
which
we
principally
relied
might
have
been
involved
if
traditionally
had
not
issued
opinions
with
respect
to
section
21,
because
that
is
a
criminal
statute.
we
submit,
however,
that
had
the
board
issued
a
ruling
under
section
21,
it
would
have
been
required
by
the
logic
of
its
finding
to
have
concluded
that
the
bank,
if
indeed
this
is
a
single
entity,
that
the
bank
would
be
engaged
in
the
business
of
issuing
and
selling
securities
as
referred
to
in
section
21.
the
board
found
that
the
units
of
participation
were
securities.
the
board
has
repeatedly
found
that
an
ordinary
mutual
fund
in
these
purposes,
this
is
the
same
as
the
ordinary
mutual
fund,
is
primarily
engaged
in
issuing
those
securities
because
of
the
redemption
feature,
the
need
to
raise
cash
to
take
care
of
redemptions.
we
submit
if
the
board
have
not
voluntarily
withheld
jurisdiction
under
section
21,
it
would
have
concluded
that
section
21
is
violated.
i
should
like
--
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
yes
sir,
it
seems
to
be.
that
has
been
a
much
mooted
point.
the
federal
reserve
board
taking
the
position
that
it's
a
single
entity,
securities
and
exchange
commission
taking
the
position
they
are
two
entities,
but
for
our
purposes,
--
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
either
way,
if
it
is
two
entities,
we
submit
the
section
32
is
violated.
if
it
is
single
entity,
we
submit
the
section
21
is
violated.
i
should
like
to
briefly
refer
to
one
additional
matter
that
was
dealt
with
in
the
court
below.
the
court
below
indicated
that
the
essence
and
i’m
referring
to
judge
bazelon’s
concurring
opinion
which
dealt
with
the
merits.
that
the
essence
of
his
holding
was
that
the
securities
dealings
here
involved,
that
is
the
portfolio
dealings,
were
for
the
account
of
customers
and
not
for
the
account
of
the
bank;
meaning
that
no
funds
of
the
bank
were
involved
in
the
dealings
and
therefore
in
his
view,
the
glass-steagall
act
was
not
violated.
this
reflected
a
judgment
on
the
part
of
judge
bazelon,
that
the
glass-steagall
act
was
intended
to
prohibit
only
bank
securities
activities
which
somehow
or
other
endangered
the
assets
of
the
bank
and
the
depositors
in
the
bank.
now,
there
is
no
question,
that
a
reading
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
glass-steagall
act
shows
that
a
principle
concern
of
congress
was
the
fact
that
bank
assets
were
depleted
by
the
speculative
activities
of
the
banks
in
the
1920’s.
but
also,
there
is
no
doubt
from
a
reading
of
the
legislative
history
that
congress
had
many
other
concerns
in
mind
and
a
principle
additional
concern
was
the
concern
that
a
bank,
not
have
anything
to
offer
in
the
line
of
securities,
anything
to
offer
for
sale
to
bank
customers
that
a
customer
of
a
bank
could
rely
upon
the
banker
for
disinterested
advice
with
respect
to
the
purchase
of
securities.
we
submit
that
that
congressional
concern
is
clearly
violated
by
an
account
of
this
kind.
this
bank's
profits
and
any
banks
profit
under
a
commingled
account,
directly
depends
upon
the
selling
of
securities.
the
fee
--
the
management
fee
earned
under
the
investment
advisory
contract,
goes
up
directly
in
accordance
with
the
number
of
participations
that
are
sold
and
as
the
assets
of
the
fund
thereby
increase.
we
submit
that,
that
concern
of
congress
which
was
also
a
principle
concern
in
the
glass-steagall
--
at
the
time
of
the
glass-steagall
act
is
violated
by
these
provisions.
it
is
not
enough
to
say
as
the
court
below
said
that
as
long
as
the
bank's
funds
are
not
involved,
as
long
as
this
is
for
the
account
of
customers
and
not
for
the
account
of
the
bank,
that
there
is
no
violation.
indeed,
we
submit
that
that
is
incorrect
reading
of
the
language
of
section
16
which
i’ve
referred
to
before.
the
language
reading
that
a
bank
may
solely
upon
a
order
and
for
the
account
of
customers
and
not
for
its
own
account,
buy
and
sell
securities
for
the
customer.
we
submit
that
that
language
clearly
indicates
and
the
contemporaneous
authorities
underscore
this,
it
clearly
confers
nothing
more
than
a
limited
power
to
perform
an
accommodation
service
for
individual
customers
on
an
individual
basis.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
trust
powers
of
banks.
that
kind
of
service
can
be
performed
by
any
bank
whether
or
not
it
has
trust
powers.
if
i
may,
i
should
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
it
has
been
our
intention
to
rely
upon
the
standing
arguments
made
in
our
reply
brief,
but
i
would
of
course
be
happy
to
discuss
any
questions
that
the
court
may
wish
to
address
to
me.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
in
our
view
mr.
justice,
this
court’s
decision
recently
in
the
data
processing
case
and
a
subsequent
brief
--
per
curium
order
in
the
arnold
tours
case,
disposes
of
standing
as
an
issue
in
this
proceeding.
as
we
analyze
in
our
reply
brief
filed
on
november
20,
1970,
we
read
the
data
processing
as
eliminating
the
so
called
legal
interest
test
which
had
deviled
courts
and
litigants
for
so
many
years
and
substituting
three
tests
on
the
question
of
standing.
the
first
test
whether
there
is
injury
in
fact
and
indeed
several
members
of
this
court
would
hold
that
injury
in
fact
is
enough.
i
believe
it’s
conceded
all
around
that
we
have
shown
a
case
of
injury
in
fact
here.
the
district
court
found
the
members
of
the
petitioner
of
institute
would
be
irreparably
injured
if
the
comptroller’s
regulation
and
his
specific
authority
were
allowed
to
stand.
the
comptroller
himself
has
predicted
that
billions
of
dollars
will
soon
be
invested
in
bank
--
commingled
accounts
bank,
the
mutual
funds,
if
his
regulation
is
allowed
to
stand.
i
do
not
believe
there
is
any
contention
that
we
do
not
--
we
have
not
shown
injury
in
fact.
a
third
criterion
set
up
by
the
courts
in
data
processing
is
that
the
statute
itself
shall
not
preclude
judicial
review.
here
again,
i
don’t
think
there
can
be
any
claim
that
the
statutes
here
involve
a
national
banking
act
and
the
several
sections
do
preclude
judicial
review
and
i
don’t
understand
the
comptroller
or
anyone
else
in
this
case
to
make
such
a
contention.
that
returns
us
to
the
second
test,
is
--
are
the
plaintiffs
here
arguably
within
the
zone
of
interest
to
be
protected
or
regulated
by
the
statute
in
question?
well
quite
clearly,
the
mutual
funds
who
are
members
of
the
petitioner
institute
are
within
the
zone
of
interests
regulated
by
the
statute
in
question.
indeed,
the
statute
in
question,
namely
section
32,
has
been
applied
repeatedly
to
ordinary
mutual
funds.
on
a
number
of
occasions,
ordinary
mutual
funds
have
petitioned
the
federal
reserve
board
for
the
right
to
include
among
their
unaffiliated
directors.
under
the
investment
company
act,
each
mutual
fund
must
have
a
certain
percentage
of
unaffiliated
directors,
it
is
petitioned
to
federal
reserve
board
for
the
right
to
use
prominent
businessmen
who
are
eminently
qualified
except
for
one
thing,
that
they
are
also
directors
of
member
banks
of
the
federal
reserve
system.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
yes
sir,
but
--
i
wanted
to
point
out
that
even
had
the
justice
would
require
a
continuance
of
that.
the
federal
reserve
board
has
ruled
that
it
is
not.
the
federal
reserve
board
has
ruled
that
under
section
32,
directors
of
member
banks
are
unavailable
to
mutual
funds
as
directors
of
the
mutual
funds.
it
has
repeatedly
so
held
--
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
yes
sir.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
yes
sir.
what
was
involved
in
data
processing
and
arnold
tours
were
claims
that
under
section
16,
data
processing
services
in
the
one
case
and
travel
agency
services
in
the
other
were
not
within
the
incidental
powers
of
banks.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
much
more
clearly
than
in
those
two
cases
in
our
judgment.
in
those
two
cases
--
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
yes
sir.
and
we
have
in
our
judgment
and
in
our
a
fortiori
argument
here
that
congress
has
specifically
spoken
and
said
that
the
bank
should
not
be
engaged
in
the
securities
business.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
well
i
have
potential
--
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
--
mr.
justice
to
analyze
the
three
standards
set
forth
in
the
data
processing
case.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
it
seems
to
that
the
per
curium
order
in
arnold
tours
makes
it
pretty
clear
that
if
an
arguable
case
can
be
made
that
a
particular
activity
is
prohibited
to
banks,
that
one
who
is
engaged
in
that
activity
is
entitled
to
present
that
arguable
case
to
the
courts
for
adjudication.
it
is
arguably
within
the
zone
of
interest.
now
in
our
case,
we’re
not
just
arguably
within
the
zone
of
interest
regulated
by
the
statute,
we
are
in
within
the
zone
of
interest
regulated.
we
are
barred
by
this
statute
from
going
into
the
banking
business.
we
are
specifically
barred
by
section
21
and
in
our
judgment,
we
have
standing
to
challenge.
we
indeed
probably
are
the
only
party
that
would
challenge
the
attempt
by
the
comptroller
to
permit
national
bank’s
to
go
across
the
wall
from
the
other
side.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
mr.
justice
black
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
dwell
just
briefly
on
the
fiduciary
point
that
has
been
emphasized
so
much
in
mr.
cox’s
argument.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
this
commingled
investment
fund,
this
bank
mutual
fund
is
operated
by
the
trust
department
of
a
bank,
in
this
case,
city
bank’s
trust
department
and
this
indeed
is
the
only
such
fund
that
has
come
in
to
being.
but
beyond
that
point,
the
operation
of
this
fund
is
no
more
or
no
less
fiduciary
than
the
operation
of
any
ordinary
mutual
fund,
whether
that
mutual
fund
takes
the
form
of
the
massachusetts
trust
as
some
of
them
do
or
whether
the
fund
is
has
--
they
more
commonly
are
a
corporation.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
much
of
the
argument
seems
to
suggest
the
original
comptrollers’
intention
with
respect
to
regulation
9
which
intention
was
abandoned
when
the
comptroller
approved
city
banks’
fund
and
said
that
he
would
amend
regulation
9
to
permit
all
other
funds
like
city
banks
to
be
operated.
the
comptroller
originally
indicated
in
1963
with
respect
to
his
first
regulation
and
his
report
is
quoted
on
pages
2
and
3
of
our
reply
brief,
that
such
a
fund
may
not
engage
in
the
selling
of
interests
and
pool
funds.
accordingly,
there
may
be
no
agreement
between
the
bank
and
the
customer
that
the
latter’s
funds
will
be
invested
in
collective
investment
funds,
nor
may
managing
an
agency
contracts
be
operated
or
hailed
out
as
interest
in
a
collective
investment
fund.
now,
every
one
of
the
things
mentioned
by
the
comptroller
there
is
directly
contrary
to
what
is
being
done
in
connection
with
the
city
bank
fund.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
he
had
perhaps
in
mind
the
same
sort
of
thing
as
a
common
trust
fund
where
the
bank
does
in
the
normal
course
obtain
funds
and
then
exercises
a
discretion
as
to
whether
the
fund
should
be
administered
individually
or
whether
perhaps
it
might
be
more
economical
or
more
efficient
to
invest
them
in
a
commingled
fund.
he
had
that
in
mind
with
respect
to
these.
but
this
city
bank
fund
fails
on
every
one
of
those
tests.
here,
the
arrangement
provides
for
the
automatic
investment
of
the
participant’s
funds
into
the
commingled
fund,
and
the
managing
agency
contract
in
the
fund
is
itself
held
out
as
an
investment
trust.
indeed,
it
is
in
those
points
mentioned
by
the
comptroller
in
1963
which
he
abandoned
during
the
course
of
permitting
the
city
banks’
fund
to
operate
in
accordance
with
his
ruling
in
1965,
it
is
--
those
very
points
that
distinguish
this
kind
of
a
fund
from
the
common
trust
fund
that
we
discussed
a
bit
--
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
section
32
prohibits
such
an
affiliation
between
a
member
bank
--
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
well,
it’s
the
interpretation
of
the
federal
reserve
board
that
section
32
which
prohibits
such
an
affiliation
with
the
company
or
a
man
affiliated
with
the
company
primarily
engaged
in
the
issuance
of
securities
and
the
federal
reserve
board
has
held
repeatedly
that
an
ordinary
open-end
mutual
fund
is
primarily
engaged
in
the
issuance
of
securities
within
the
meaning
of
section
32.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
because
of
the
inherent
conflicts
of
interest
that
congress
determined
in
the
association
between
security
affiliates
on
the
one
hand
and
banks
on
the
other
hand,
and
that
raises
the
point
mr.
justice
white
if
i
may
comment
upon
it
with
respect
to
the
argument
both
by
the
comptroller
and
mr.
cox,
that
somehow
or
rather
the
legislative
history
of
the
glass-steagall
act
indicates
that
all
congress
was
concerned
with
was
separating
the
investment
banking
from
commercial
banking.
congress
clearly
was
concerned
in
doing
that.
we
don’t
deny
that,
but
it
had
many
other
concerns
and
one
of
the
concerns
was
to
eliminate
any
possibility
of
direct
engagement
or
affiliation
with
companies
that
are
primarily
engaged
in
issuing
and
selling
securities,
whether
as
investment
bankers
or
not.
that
a
mutual
fund
under
no
circumstances
is
even
remotely
akin
to
investment
banking,
and
yet
the
federal
reserve
board
has
repeatedly
held
that
a
mutual
fund
is
engaged
in
the
kind
of
activity
that
congress
wanted
to
prohibit
to
banks
directly
or
through
affiliates
in
the
glass-steagall
act.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
mr.
justice
white
as
i
indicated
in
my
earlier
argument,
the
federal
reserve
board
looked
at
this
particular
fund
and
this
particular
relationship,
in
our
judgment,
a
reading
of
that,
the
decision
would
indicate
that
they
would
have
held
the
relationship
unlawful,
but
for
their
holding.
that
they
were
not
the
two
entities
and
therefore
there
could
not
be
the
interlock.
that
is
the
sole
basis
for
their
holding.
now,
with
respect
to
this
question
that
has
been
repeatedly
been
urged
here
that
this
is
a
mere
modest
extension
of
common
trust
fund
activities,
in
particular
with
a
respect
to
a
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
stewart
this
morning
with
respect
to
setting
up
trusts,
interviable
trusts
specifically
for
investment
in
common
trust
funds.
the
federal
reserve
board
through
the
years
and
the
banker’s
manuals
have
repeatedly
urged
against
that
kind
of
a
situation.
indeed,
we
cite
in
our
reply
brief
a
ruling
on
page
10
of
our
reply
brief
where
the
federal
reserve
board
that
dealt
with
the
very
similar
situation.
in
that
case,
a
corporation,
this
ruling
appears
in
the
september,
1947
bulletin
of
the
federal
reserve
board,
in
that
case,
a
corporation
which
wished
to
place
certain
funds
to
establish
a
trust
so
that
they
could
place
those
funds
in
the
bank’s
common
trust
fund,
and
the
board
ruled
and
i
quote
from
the
1947
bulletin,
“under
the
facts
presented,
it
appears
that
there
is
no
reason
for
the
creation
of
the
trust
other
than
the
desire
of
the
corporation
to
invest
its
funds
in
participations
in
the
common
trust
fund.”
the
trust
merely
is
a
mechanism
designed
to
enable
the
corporation
to
acquire
such
participations
in
lieu
of
other
investments.
the
analogy
with
the
purchase
of
investment
trust
certificates
is
apparent
and
the
use
of
a
common
trust
fund
for
this
purpose
amongst
substance
to
the
operation
of
the
fund
is
an
ordinary
investment
trust.
common
trust
funds
were
not
permitted
for
that
purpose,
we
submit,
because
the
glass-steagall
act
would
be
violated
by
such
operation
of
a
common
trust
fund
and
we
similarly
submit
that
this
commingled
fund
violates
glass-steagall.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
no
sir.
common
trust
funds
to
this
day
are
not
permitted
to
be
operated
in
that
fashion.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
yes,
sir.
if
you
come
in
to
the
bank
and
the
bank
makes
no
attempt
to
sell
you
a
certificate
in
the
common
trust
fund,
takes
your
funds,
makes
the
judgment
as
to
whether
your
funds
should
be
appropriately
be
put
in
the
bank.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
no,
sir.
