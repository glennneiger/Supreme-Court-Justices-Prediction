justice
potter
stewart
as
you
suggested
mr.
levin,
there's
a
companion
case
to
be
heard,
i
guess
tomorrow
morning
and
if
by
chance,
the
court
should
decide
that
case
--
that
is
it
should
decide
in
that
case
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
then
the
court
need
not
and
might
not
ever
reach
this
case,
wouldn’t
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
i
suppose
also
vice
versa
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
if
it
decides
in
your
favor
in
this
case,
it
wouldn’t
reach
that
case.
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
first
place.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
really
does
come
first
i
should
suppose,
doesn’t
it
because
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
logical
look
at
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
then
you
have
to
begin
with
the
reference
that
the
commission
had
power
to
do
what
it
did?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
not
talking
about
expression,
it
had
the
power
to
do
it.
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
not
on
the
authority
of
the
commission
to
claim
that
it
abuses
discretion
--
justice
potter
stewart
here
you
of
course
oppose
the
grant
of
the
exemption.
justice
potter
stewart
you
of
course
in
this
case
opposed
before
the
commission
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
the
ground
of
the
exemption.
there
was
no
hearing
i
guess.
justice
potter
stewart
hearing
of
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
the
applicant
for
the
exemption.
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words
that
if
you
should
prevail
in
tomorrow
morning’s
case,
a
different
mechanism
might
be
found
that
would
not
--
did
not
need
the
approval
or
did
not
need
to
be
--
there
would
exempt
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
act?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
so
i
was
mistaken
in
my
vice-versa
comment.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
you
say
goes
back
to
1913.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
for
inter-vivo
trustees
or
testamentary
trustees
and
what
bank
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
could
participate
in
a
commingled
fund
for
various
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
executorships,
right.
justice
potter
stewart
now
if
there
were
about
a
single
investor
of
the
1940
act
would
not
be
applicable.
justice
potter
stewart
nor
would
it
be
applicable
to
the
management,
service
by
a
bank
for
a
single
investor.
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
an
indication
in
the
footnote,
i
don’t
have
it
in
front
of
me
but
something
to
the
effect
that
it’s
possible
or
may
be
even
likely
that
if
the
commission
were
dealing
with
this
problem
now,
it
would
not
reach
the
same
conclusion.
justice
potter
stewart
i’ve
read
it,
i
don’t
have
in
front
of
me.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
i
understood
mr.
cox
to
say
and
answer
a
question
to
mr.
justice
white’s
that
the
bank
or
perhaps
i
didn’t
hear
it
correctly,
could
not
make
a
loan
to
one
of
these
accounts?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know.
what
is
the
significance
in
18
a
of
mr.
cox’s
brief
of
section
of
3(f)?
a
national
bank
may
make
a
loan
to
an
account
and
may
take
a
security
therefore
assets
of
the
account,
provided
such
transactions
fair
to
such
account
and
it’s
not
prohibited
by
local
law.
it
started
with
f
at
18(a)
mr.
cox’s
brief
of
july
18th.
there
are
two
briefs
in
this,
one
in
december
and
the
other
in
july.
justice
potter
stewart
this
does
say
that
under
the
conditions
there
set
out,
the
bank
may
make
a
loan
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
does
it
deal
with
this
account?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
mr.
cox
were
telling
us
that
regulation
9
governed
to
the
operation
of
the
relationship
between
the
bank
and
the
account
we
have
before
us.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
except
for
9.18
then,
are
you
telling
us
that
none
of
the
rest
of
regulation
9
printed
here
has
any
relationship?
justice
potter
stewart
and
these
9.18
you’re
suggesting
is
more
restrictive
on
what
the
market-banks
relationship
would
be
--
justice
potter
stewart
than
is
9.11.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
just
one
more
question.
and
i
understand
then
that
provision
of
9.12
(a)
at
page
17
(a),
that’s
still
another
one.
unless
lawfully
authorized
by
the
instrument
creating
the
relationship
or
by
court
order
or
by
local
law,
funds
held
by
the
national
bank
as
fiduciary
shall
not
be
invested
and
so
forth
which
means
that
if
they
were
lawfully
authorized
by
means
of
creating
a
relationship,
they
could
be
invested
in
property
acquired
from
the
bank
(inaudible)
and
so
forth.
you’re
telling
me
that
does
not
apply
to
this
kind
of
account,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
that
provision
says
unless
authorized
by
the
instrument
creating
--
justice
potter
stewart
where
in
9.18
is
a
prohibition
against
the
inclusion
of
a
provision
under
9.12
in
the
instrument
creating
the
account,
what’s
that
in
9.18?
justice
potter
stewart
page
21
(a)
of
mr.
cox’s
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
9.18,
it’s
a
collective
investment.
i
gather
this,
mr.
cox
is
giving
us
the
full
text
of
regulation
9,
hadn’t
he?
justice
potter
stewart
b8i?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
that
those
provisions
--
do
you
think
on
their
face
proscribe
a
national
bank
making
a
loan
to
one
of
these
collective
funds?
justice
potter
stewart
from
anybody?
justice
potter
stewart
from
anybody.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
where
is
there
any
expressed
provision
saying
that
the
bank
won’t
sell
any
--
can’t
sell
any
property
to
the
funds?
justice
potter
stewart
prohibits
the
sale?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
let’s
assume
the
bank
has
a
portfolio
or
loans
of
real
estate
mortgages
that
it
would
like
to
market
to
free
up
some
of
its
fund
and
they
are
very
good
real
estate
mortgages.
and
certainly
they
might
sell
them
to
a
mortgage
company
or
something.
may
they
sell
them
to
the
fund
as
a
perfectly
good
investment
of
the
fund
in
real
estate?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
said
that
it
doesn’t
apply.
justice
potter
stewart
all
the
instrument
would
have
to
do
is
to
authorize
it
and
the
bank
may
transfer
properly
to
the
fund.
justice
potter
stewart
or
there's
any
provision
against
the
instruments
authorized?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
here’s
the
regulation
so
is
there
--
or
isn’t
there
any
provision
against
the
bank
selling
property
to
a
firm?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
friedman,
do
you
know
whether
new
york
has
statutes
as
many
states
do
which
specifically
prohibits
self
dealing.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
think
there
are
some
states
more
enlightened
in
investment
fields
than
even
new
york
but
other
states
do
have
such
either
by
court
decision
common
law
or
by
specific
statute.
and
i
would
be
surprised
if
it
were
not
present
somewhere
in
the
new
york
structure.
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
at
the
time
of
the
consideration
of
the
bill
that
became
the
1940
act?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
understand
the
point
is
not
available
to
the
general
public.
it’s
just
as
available
as
a
mutual
fund
is.
if
you
have
$10,000.00
you’ve
been
--
you
have
right
of
trust
instrument
or
inter-vivo
trust
and
turn
over
to
the
bank's
trustee
and
it’s
just
as
available
to
the
man
with
$10,000.00
as
it
is
an
open-ended
investment.
justice
potter
stewart
the
bank
couldn’t
use
it
as
a
trustee
under
inter-vivos
trust?
justice
potter
stewart
the
bank
couldn’t
–
as
a
matter
of
solicitation
of
it
but
it’s
certainly
was
just
available,
if
john
smith
has
$10,000.00,
he
could
just
as
well
make
an
inter-vivos
trust
and
turned
over
to
a
bank,
it
could
be
invested
by
the
bank
as
trustee
in
the
common
trust
fund
as
he
could
go
out
and
buy
shares
in
an
open-end
investment
trust.
justice
potter
stewart
does
it
advertise
publicly?
justice
potter
stewart
i
notice
the
appendix
to
your
reply
brief,
you
have
tendered
a
couple
of
advertisements,
but
there
are
not
of
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
this
is
not
an
advertisement
of
what
we're
talking
about
here?
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
something
else?
justice
potter
stewart
right,
right.
justice
potter
stewart
you
still
don’t
quite
to
say
why
that
isn’t
just
as
available
to
the
public
as
any
other
form
of
investment.
of
course
it’s
a
limited
public,
you
have
it
--
it
has
to
be
members
of
the
public
who
has
some
money.
but
assuming
john
smith
has
$10,000.00,
why
isn’t
that
the
common
trust
fund
of
a
bank
just
as
available
to
him
as
shares
of
massachusetts
investments
trust?
he
executes
a
trust
instrument
and
turns
it
over
by
way
of
interviable
as
trust
to
the
bank
as
the
trustee
and
that’s
the
end
of
it.
justice
potter
stewart
--
previous
customer,
john
did
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
bank
and
say,
here’s
the
--
here
is
a
trust
my
lawyer
has
prepared
for
me
and
it's
all
signed
and
please
sign
here
and
accept
it,
and
here’s
$10,000.00,
you’re
an
interviable's
trustee.
justice
potter
stewart
all
that
would
indicate
that
the
--
what’s
suggested
by
my
question
is
correct,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
they’re
very
similar
to
an
investment
in
an
open-end
investment
company,
particularly
if
it’s
revocable.
justice
potter
stewart
economically
they
are
same
thing,
aren’t
they?
justice
potter
stewart
one
entity
there
is
of
course
entirely
at
adds
with
this
theory
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
either
way.
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
going
to
--
in
the
balance
of
your
time
in
rebuttal,
did
you
plan
the
deal
with
the
question
of
standing?
justice
potter
stewart
alright,
i
just
wanted
to
--
that
was
really
important
part
of
the
case.
justice
potter
stewart
how
does
that
help
you
from
the
point
of
your
standing?
i
understand
your
argument
that
this
is
not
a
proper
part
of
the
banking
business
but
how
does
that
gets
you
down
on
the
road
--
justice
potter
stewart
--standing
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
understood
your
argument.
i
really
didn’t
understand
my
brother’s
question
i
suppose.[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
some
--
while
some
most
assuredly
might
say
our
brother
douglas
has
suggested
that
these
are
private
attorney
generals
trying
to
promote
competition.
others
like
the
equal
logic
say
these
are
people
trying
to
preserve
a
monopolistic
position.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
freedman,
do
you
think
its
basic
purpose
was
to
prevent
commercial
banks
engaging
in
the
investment
banking
business?
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
it
--
there
surely
a
difference
between
a
sole
proprietorship
than
a
publicly
own
corporation,
isn’t
there,
even
though
both
may
be
engaged
in
not
the
identical
business?
justice
potter
stewart
to
co
--?
justice
potter
stewart
25a
of
what?
justice
potter
stewart
aren’t
some
of
the
older
mutual
funds
or
at
least
in
certain
states,
aren't
they
in
the
form
of
trusts?
because
in
this
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
would
be.
there
is
that
direct
fiduciary,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
bank
can
advertise
its
ordinary
banking
and
trust
services,
can
it
for
freely
or
is
there
some
limitation
or
prohibition
of
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
let’s
take
this
one
at
a
time.
you
are
not
wrong
in
understanding
that
the
bank
can
advertise
its
general
services
quite
apart
from
this
kind
of
thing.
justice
potter
stewart
freely
or
generally,
can
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
once
it
in
legal
customers
by
way
of
that
advertising
then
it
can
circularize
those
customers
advertising
this?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
my
point
is
it
can
originally
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
by
ordinary
conventional
advertising
and
once
it’s
got
them
then
it
can
circularize
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
kind
of
animal
did
the
comptroller
originally
had
in
mind?
justice
potter
stewart
they
use
to
--
this
is
out
of
date,
isn’t
it
that
ruling?
are
they
permitted
now?
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
you
make
an
interviable’s
trust
for
the
bank
as
trustee,
surely
if
permitted
by
state
law,
that
bank
is
permitted
to
as
fiduciary
to
invest
in
a
commingled
trust
fund,
is
it
not
operated
by
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
this
trust
fund
provides
it
may
and
if
state
law
provides
it
may,
then
there’s
no
federal
inhibition
on
it,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
as
you
suggested
mr.
levin,
there's
a
companion
case
to
be
heard,
i
guess
tomorrow
morning
and
if
by
chance,
the
court
should
decide
that
case
--
that
is
it
should
decide
in
that
case
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
then
the
court
need
not
and
might
not
ever
reach
this
case,
wouldn’t
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
i
suppose
also
vice
versa
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
if
it
decides
in
your
favor
in
this
case,
it
wouldn’t
reach
that
case.
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
first
place.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
really
does
come
first
i
should
suppose,
doesn’t
it
because
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
logical
look
at
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
then
you
have
to
begin
with
the
reference
that
the
commission
had
power
to
do
what
it
did?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
not
talking
about
expression,
it
had
the
power
to
do
it.
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
not
on
the
authority
of
the
commission
to
claim
that
it
abuses
discretion
--
justice
potter
stewart
here
you
of
course
oppose
the
grant
of
the
exemption.
justice
potter
stewart
you
of
course
in
this
case
opposed
before
the
commission
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
the
ground
of
the
exemption.
there
was
no
hearing
i
guess.
justice
potter
stewart
hearing
of
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
the
applicant
for
the
exemption.
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words
that
if
you
should
prevail
in
tomorrow
morning’s
case,
a
different
mechanism
might
be
found
that
would
not
--
did
not
need
the
approval
or
did
not
need
to
be
--
there
would
exempt
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
act?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
so
i
was
mistaken
in
my
vice-versa
comment.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
you
say
goes
back
to
1913.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
for
inter-vivo
trustees
or
testamentary
trustees
and
what
bank
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
could
participate
in
a
commingled
fund
for
various
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
executorships,
right.
justice
potter
stewart
now
if
there
were
about
a
single
investor
of
the
1940
act
would
not
be
applicable.
justice
potter
stewart
nor
would
it
be
applicable
to
the
management,
service
by
a
bank
for
a
single
investor.
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
an
indication
in
the
footnote,
i
don’t
have
it
in
front
of
me
but
something
to
the
effect
that
it’s
possible
or
may
be
even
likely
that
if
the
commission
were
dealing
with
this
problem
now,
it
would
not
reach
the
same
conclusion.
justice
potter
stewart
i’ve
read
it,
i
don’t
have
in
front
of
me.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
i
understood
mr.
cox
to
say
and
answer
a
question
to
mr.
justice
white’s
that
the
bank
or
perhaps
i
didn’t
hear
it
correctly,
could
not
make
a
loan
to
one
of
these
accounts?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know.
what
is
the
significance
in
18
a
of
mr.
cox’s
brief
of
section
of
3(f)?
a
national
bank
may
make
a
loan
to
an
account
and
may
take
a
security
therefore
assets
of
the
account,
provided
such
transactions
fair
to
such
account
and
it’s
not
prohibited
by
local
law.
it
started
with
f
at
18(a)
mr.
cox’s
brief
of
july
18th.
there
are
two
briefs
in
this,
one
in
december
and
the
other
in
july.
justice
potter
stewart
this
does
say
that
under
the
conditions
there
set
out,
the
bank
may
make
a
loan
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
does
it
deal
with
this
account?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
mr.
cox
were
telling
us
that
regulation
9
governed
to
the
operation
of
the
relationship
between
the
bank
and
the
account
we
have
before
us.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
except
for
9.18
then,
are
you
telling
us
that
none
of
the
rest
of
regulation
9
printed
here
has
any
relationship?
justice
potter
stewart
and
these
9.18
you’re
suggesting
is
more
restrictive
on
what
the
market-banks
relationship
would
be
--
justice
potter
stewart
than
is
9.11.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
just
one
more
question.
and
i
understand
then
that
provision
of
9.12
(a)
at
page
17
(a),
that’s
still
another
one.
unless
lawfully
authorized
by
the
instrument
creating
the
relationship
or
by
court
order
or
by
local
law,
funds
held
by
the
national
bank
as
fiduciary
shall
not
be
invested
and
so
forth
which
means
that
if
they
were
lawfully
authorized
by
means
of
creating
a
relationship,
they
could
be
invested
in
property
acquired
from
the
bank
(inaudible)
and
so
forth.
you’re
telling
me
that
does
not
apply
to
this
kind
of
account,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
that
provision
says
unless
authorized
by
the
instrument
creating
--
justice
potter
stewart
where
in
9.18
is
a
prohibition
against
the
inclusion
of
a
provision
under
9.12
in
the
instrument
creating
the
account,
what’s
that
in
9.18?
justice
potter
stewart
page
21
(a)
of
mr.
cox’s
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
9.18,
it’s
a
collective
investment.
i
gather
this,
mr.
cox
is
giving
us
the
full
text
of
regulation
9,
hadn’t
he?
justice
potter
stewart
b8i?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
that
those
provisions
--
do
you
think
on
their
face
proscribe
a
national
bank
making
a
loan
to
one
of
these
collective
funds?
justice
potter
stewart
from
anybody?
justice
potter
stewart
from
anybody.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
where
is
there
any
expressed
provision
saying
that
the
bank
won’t
sell
any
--
can’t
sell
any
property
to
the
funds?
justice
potter
stewart
prohibits
the
sale?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
let’s
assume
the
bank
has
a
portfolio
or
loans
of
real
estate
mortgages
that
it
would
like
to
market
to
free
up
some
of
its
fund
and
they
are
very
good
real
estate
mortgages.
and
certainly
they
might
sell
them
to
a
mortgage
company
or
something.
may
they
sell
them
to
the
fund
as
a
perfectly
good
investment
of
the
fund
in
real
estate?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
said
that
it
doesn’t
apply.
justice
potter
stewart
all
the
instrument
would
have
to
do
is
to
authorize
it
and
the
bank
may
transfer
properly
to
the
fund.
justice
potter
stewart
or
there's
any
provision
against
the
instruments
authorized?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
here’s
the
regulation
so
is
there
--
or
isn’t
there
any
provision
against
the
bank
selling
property
to
a
firm?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
friedman,
do
you
know
whether
new
york
has
statutes
as
many
states
do
which
specifically
prohibits
self
dealing.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
think
there
are
some
states
more
enlightened
in
investment
fields
than
even
new
york
but
other
states
do
have
such
either
by
court
decision
common
law
or
by
specific
statute.
and
i
would
be
surprised
if
it
were
not
present
somewhere
in
the
new
york
structure.
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
at
the
time
of
the
consideration
of
the
bill
that
became
the
1940
act?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
understand
the
point
is
not
available
to
the
general
public.
it’s
just
as
available
as
a
mutual
fund
is.
if
you
have
$10,000.00
you’ve
been
--
you
have
right
of
trust
instrument
or
inter-vivo
trust
and
turn
over
to
the
bank's
trustee
and
it’s
just
as
available
to
the
man
with
$10,000.00
as
it
is
an
open-ended
investment.
justice
potter
stewart
the
bank
couldn’t
use
it
as
a
trustee
under
inter-vivos
trust?
justice
potter
stewart
the
bank
couldn’t
–
as
a
matter
of
solicitation
of
it
but
it’s
certainly
was
just
available,
if
john
smith
has
$10,000.00,
he
could
just
as
well
make
an
inter-vivos
trust
and
turned
over
to
a
bank,
it
could
be
invested
by
the
bank
as
trustee
in
the
common
trust
fund
as
he
could
go
out
and
buy
shares
in
an
open-end
investment
trust.
justice
potter
stewart
does
it
advertise
publicly?
justice
potter
stewart
i
notice
the
appendix
to
your
reply
brief,
you
have
tendered
a
couple
of
advertisements,
but
there
are
not
of
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
this
is
not
an
advertisement
of
what
we're
talking
about
here?
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
something
else?
justice
potter
stewart
right,
right.
justice
potter
stewart
you
still
don’t
quite
to
say
why
that
isn’t
just
as
available
to
the
public
as
any
other
form
of
investment.
of
course
it’s
a
limited
public,
you
have
it
--
it
has
to
be
members
of
the
public
who
has
some
money.
but
assuming
john
smith
has
$10,000.00,
why
isn’t
that
the
common
trust
fund
of
a
bank
just
as
available
to
him
as
shares
of
massachusetts
investments
trust?
he
executes
a
trust
instrument
and
turns
it
over
by
way
of
interviable
as
trust
to
the
bank
as
the
trustee
and
that’s
the
end
of
it.
justice
potter
stewart
--
previous
customer,
john
did
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
bank
and
say,
here’s
the
--
here
is
a
trust
my
lawyer
has
prepared
for
me
and
it's
all
signed
and
please
sign
here
and
accept
it,
and
here’s
$10,000.00,
you’re
an
interviable's
trustee.
justice
potter
stewart
all
that
would
indicate
that
the
--
what’s
suggested
by
my
question
is
correct,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
they’re
very
similar
to
an
investment
in
an
open-end
investment
company,
particularly
if
it’s
revocable.
justice
potter
stewart
economically
they
are
same
thing,
aren’t
they?
justice
potter
stewart
one
entity
there
is
of
course
entirely
at
adds
with
this
theory
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
either
way.
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
going
to
--
in
the
balance
of
your
time
in
rebuttal,
did
you
plan
the
deal
with
the
question
of
standing?
justice
potter
stewart
alright,
i
just
wanted
to
--
that
was
really
important
part
of
the
case.
justice
potter
stewart
how
does
that
help
you
from
the
point
of
your
standing?
i
understand
your
argument
that
this
is
not
a
proper
part
of
the
banking
business
but
how
does
that
gets
you
down
on
the
road
--
justice
potter
stewart
--standing
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
understood
your
argument.
i
really
didn’t
understand
my
brother’s
question
i
suppose.[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
some
--
while
some
most
assuredly
might
say
our
brother
douglas
has
suggested
that
these
are
private
attorney
generals
trying
to
promote
competition.
others
like
the
equal
logic
say
these
are
people
trying
to
preserve
a
monopolistic
position.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
freedman,
do
you
think
its
basic
purpose
was
to
prevent
commercial
banks
engaging
in
the
investment
banking
business?
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
it
--
there
surely
a
difference
between
a
sole
proprietorship
than
a
publicly
own
corporation,
isn’t
there,
even
though
both
may
be
engaged
in
not
the
identical
business?
justice
potter
stewart
to
co
--?
justice
potter
stewart
25a
of
what?
justice
potter
stewart
aren’t
some
of
the
older
mutual
funds
or
at
least
in
certain
states,
aren't
they
in
the
form
of
trusts?
because
in
this
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
would
be.
there
is
that
direct
fiduciary,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
bank
can
advertise
its
ordinary
banking
and
trust
services,
can
it
for
freely
or
is
there
some
limitation
or
prohibition
of
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
let’s
take
this
one
at
a
time.
you
are
not
wrong
in
understanding
that
the
bank
can
advertise
its
general
services
quite
apart
from
this
kind
of
thing.
justice
potter
stewart
freely
or
generally,
can
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
once
it
in
legal
customers
by
way
of
that
advertising
then
it
can
circularize
those
customers
advertising
this?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
my
point
is
it
can
originally
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
by
ordinary
conventional
advertising
and
once
it’s
got
them
then
it
can
circularize
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
kind
of
animal
did
the
comptroller
originally
had
in
mind?
justice
potter
stewart
they
use
to
--
this
is
out
of
date,
isn’t
it
that
ruling?
are
they
permitted
now?
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
you
make
an
interviable’s
trust
for
the
bank
as
trustee,
surely
if
permitted
by
state
law,
that
bank
is
permitted
to
as
fiduciary
to
invest
in
a
commingled
trust
fund,
is
it
not
operated
by
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
this
trust
fund
provides
it
may
and
if
state
law
provides
it
may,
then
there’s
no
federal
inhibition
on
it,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
no.
