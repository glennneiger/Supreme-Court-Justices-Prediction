mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
justice
black
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i
would
just
like
to
explain
in
view
of
the
somewhat
unusual
posture
of
this
case
that
the
commission
is
not
appearing
here
in
defense
of
its
order
one,
why
the
united
states
is
appearing
in
this
case
and
secondly,
why
we
think
that
the
commission’s
position
in
this
case
does
not
undermine
the
validity
of
it’s
decision.
as
it’s
been
indicated
when
the
commission
granted
this
exemption
in
1966,
the
vote
was
four
to
one
with
a
strong
dissent
against
the
grant
of
the
exemption
by
commissioner
badge.
the
commission
vigorously
defended
its
order
early
in
1967
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
that
court
unanimously
upheld
the
order.
now,
by
the
time
the
case
reach
this
court
however
and
this
court
had
granted
the
petition
there
had
been
a
significant
change
in
the
membership
of
the
commission.
three
of
the
five
commissioners
who
had
originally
participated
in
the
case
were
no
longer
on
the
commission
and
of
the
remaining
two,
one
is
mr.
bage(ph)
who
by
that
point
had
become
chairman,
had
voted
against
the
exemption
that
the
other
commissioner
had
voted
in
favor
of
it.
and
it
was
in
that
posture
that
the
commission
advised
the
solicitor
general
in
june
of
1970,
that
it
was
taking
a
position
in
this
case.
this
is
the
statement
that
mr.
levin
read
to
the
court
yesterday
from
page
three
of
the
government’s
brief.
and
i
just
like
to
reiterate
two
of
the
sentences
that
the
commission
included
in
its
statement.
the
commission
said,
the
three
subsequently
appointed
members
of
the
commission
are
not
prepared
to
take
any
position.
this
was
after
the
commission
had
pointed
out
that
there
are
only
two
remaining
members.
and
one
was
--
had
voted
for
and
one
had
voted
against
the
exemption.
accordingly,
the
commission
expresses
no
position
on
the
merits
and
urges
neither
affirmance
nor
reversal
of
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
we
think
what
in
effect
the
commission
has
said
to
us
in
this
case
is
that
it
is
not
able
at
this
time
to
master
a
quorum
to
decide
what
position
to
take
in
this
case.
only
two
members
of
the
commission
at
that
point
were
prepared
to
vote
on
what
to
say.
we
strongly
disagree
with
mr.
levin’s
characterization
of
the
commission’s
action
yesterday
as
that
the
commission
had
disavowed
its
decision.
the
commission
has
not
disavowed
its
decision.
if
i
may
just
mix
an
athletic
metaphor
for
a
moment.
the
commission
in
this
case
contrary
to
petitioner's
suggestion
has
not
thrown
in
the
tile
on
this
case.
it
is
merely
sitting
this
one
out
on
the
sidelines.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
all
of
the
commissions
to
this
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
it’s
the
one
that
says
there’s
no
assurance
that
the
commission
would
reach
the
same
judgment
if
a
similar
matter
is
again
presented.
i
think
that
merely
is
a
rather
briefer
statement
of
what
was
said
in
the
original
brief
that
is
as
of
that
time
the
commission
didn’t
know
what
its
position
would
be
because
there
are
only
two
of
the
original
commissioners
then
available.
i
would
like
to
just
say
that
the
commission
has
not
disavowed
its
decision
and
it
seems
to
us
that
basically,
the
validity
of
the
commission's
action
must
be
determined
on
what
happened
when
it
acted.
not
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
sometime
thereafter
there
had
been
changes
in
the
membership
of
the
agency
and
that
the
present
membership
is
not
prepared
now
to
state,
what
position
it
would
take
if
the
issue
came
before.
indeed,
there's
another
change
in
the
offering
in
the
commission.
we
talked
about
shifts
in
membership.
chairman
badge
who
was
the
lone
dissenter
has
announced
his
retirement.
so
that
presumably
by
the
time
this
case
gets
back
to
the
commission,
there’ll
only
be
one
of
the
original
commissioners
and
we
think
that
the
commission
by
definition
is
a
continuing
body.
it
continues
as
an
entity
without
regard
to
changes
in
its
membership.
and
that
if
the
commission’s
action
was
valid
when
it
was
taken,
it
should
be
upheld
even
though
changes
in
the
body
since
that
time
might
suggest
that
if
the
commission
would
have
considered
anew,
the
commission
might
come
up
the
other
way.
the
commission
in
this
case
has
not
asked
this
court
to
remand
the
case
--
for
it
to
take
another
look
at
the
case.
and
i
think
the
reason
it
hasn’t
done
that
is
again
the
same
reason
that
there
is
no
majority
of
the
commission
that
it’s
prepared
to
take
any
position
at
this
time.
so
that
in
these
circumstances
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
this
case
you
mean?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice.
we
were
not
but
we
came
in
to
the
case
because
it
was
our
belief
that
in
view
of
the
importance
of
this
issue
and
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
unanimously
upheld
the
commission’s
order,
we
thought
it
was
not
appropriate
that
the
validity
of
the
audit
should
just
be
defended
by
the
bank
which
had
received
the
exemption.
we
thought
there
is
an
interest
to
this.
and
in
addition
to
that
although
we
haven’t
set
it
forth
in
our
brief,
the
government,
the
solicitor
general
representing
all
government
agencies
has
an
interest
in
the
basic
legal
issue
here
which
is
the
scope
of
judicial
review
of
an
agency
or
granting
an
exemption,
a
question
that
this
court
has
not
directly
dealt
with
as
far
as
i
know.
well,
this
is
the
way
of
background
as
to
why
we
think
it
was
appropriate
to
give
weight
to
the
discretion
of
the
commission
in
this
case
even
though
the
commission
is
not
here
appearing.
in
defense
of
its
order,
i’d
like
to
turn
briefly
to
the
merits
which
mr.
cocks
has
fully
covered.
and
why
we
think
that
in
this
case,
the
commission
clearly
has
not
abused
its
discretion.
the
statute
under
which
the
commission
granted
this
exemption
section
6(c)
gives
the
commission
authority
in
the
broadest
possible
terms
that
allows
it
to
exempt
any
person,
any
transaction
from
any
class
of
persons,
from
any
provision
of
the
statute.
it
couldn’t
be
broader.
and
there
is
certainly
nothing
in
that
sweeping
language
that
in
anyway
suggests
that
section
10
of
the
act
is
not
within
the
commission’s
power
to
exempt.
what
we
think
the
congress
is
obviously
contemplated
by
this
section
is
that
the
commission
shall
have
authority
to
exempt
any
transaction,
any
person,
any
security
within
its
terms,
if
the
particular
thing
for
which
exemption
is
sought
comes
within
these
public
interest
factors
that
are
listed
as
the
conditions
for
the
exemption.
that
is
if
the
exemption
is
necessary
or
appropriate
in
the
public
interest,
consistent
with
the
protection
of
investors
and
the
purpose
is
fairly
intended
by
the
policy
and
provisions
of
the
act.
now,
the
determination,
the
weighing
of
these
many
factors
that
make
up
to
this
broad
public
interest
standard
is
of
necessity,
something
that
calls
for
a
very
difficult,
close,
and
subtle
factors
of
balancing
of
judgment.
this
is
not
the
kind
of
thing
that
is
capable
of
precise
measurement,
exactly.
you
can’t
take
a
yardstick
and
say
whether
it
reaches
a
certain
point
and
therefore
is
or
is
not
consistent
with
the
public
interest.
the
granting
of
an
exemption,
the
decision
whether
or
not
the
public
interest
standards
are
met
in
this
kind
of
a
case
is
really
the
essence
of
administrative
discretion.
it’s
the
kind
of
thing
that
necessarily
has
to
be
within
the
discretion
of
the
agency.
and
we
have
developed
in
our
brief
and
as
mr.
cox
has
indicated
at
some
length,
the
commission
certainly
in
this
case
did
not
abuse
its
discretion.
the
basic
evils
at
which
10
section
(c)
was
directed
are
not
the
evils
present
here.
section
10(c)
was
put
into
the
act
because
of
a
lot
of
abuses
that
had
been
shown
to
have
taken
place
in
the
1920’s
in
the
way
in
which
the
banks
operated
these
investment
affiliates.
what
the
banks
were
doing,
they
were
using
the
investment
affiliates
as
methods
for
speculating
in
the
securities
market
and
they
were
unloading
on
the
investment
companies,
a
lot
of
the
speculative
securities.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
bank
cannot
make
a
loan
to
the
account
or
the
fund,
that
is
correct.
there
are
several
reasons
for
this
first
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
assume
that
that
is
basically
–
if
for
some
short
term
basis
is
something
like
that
but
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
justice
if
i
may
retract
my
statement.
i’ve
been
informed
that
relates
to
an
individual
account.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
does
not
deal
with
this
type
of
account.
that’s
the
controller’s
mind
that’s
informed
me.
if
i
may
explain
several
things
first
of
all
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
regulation
9
broadly
governs
all
fiduciary
activities
of
banks.
it’s
regulation
9.18
which
specifically
deals
with
commingled
accounts.
this
regulation
9
is
the
general
regulation
which
affects
the
bank's
control
and
operation
of
fiduciary
activities.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
no,
no.
i’m
not.
i’m
saying
that
regulation
9
generally
governs
the
banks
fiduciary
applications.
and
to
whatever
extent
it’s
covered
by
regulation
9
generally,
of
course
it’s
applicable
then
in
addition
to
that
the
controller
has
promulgated
special
regulations
dealing
with
commingled
accounts
which
is
9.18
which
imposes
certain
obligations
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
market-market
more
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
so,
9.18
if
i
may
point
out.
a
couple
of
things,
first
of
all
9.18
specifically
prohibits
the
bank
from
having
any
interest
in
the
account.
and
in
addition
to
that,
the
account's
own
prospectus
states
that
it
will
not
borrow
any
money
at
all.
and
finally
there
are
provisions
of
the
investment
company
act
which
specifically
prohibit
transactions
between
affiliates
at
section
17
of
the
investment
company
act
would
prohibit
the
bank
from
selling
securities
or
loaning
money
to
the
account.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
it
does
not
apply
mr.
justice
for
one
reason
which
is
that
the
arrangement
between
the
participants
and
the
bank
does
not
permit
this.
and
in
addition
to
that,
that
the
hope
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
but
it’s
not
--
9.18
in
turn
has
prohibitions
against
the
bank.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i’m
afraid
i
don’t
have
9.18
in
my
brief
in
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that’s
section
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
believe,
i’m
trying
--
it’s
section
9.18
b8i.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
let
me
see
if
i
can
find
that
in
mr.
cox’s
brief.
yes.
it’s
on
page
25
(a)
of
mr.
cox’s
brief
at
paragraph
a.
and
it
says,
a
bank
administering
a
collective
investment
fund
shall
not
have
(a)
any
interest
in
such
fund
other
than
in
a
fiduciary
capacity
or
(b)
make
any
loans
on
the
security
of
a
participation
in
search
fund,
so
it
prohibits
the
bank
from
having
any
interest
in
the
fund
except
in
a
fiduciary
capacity.
that
is
if
the
bank
itself
had
some
money
for
one
of
its
--
in
mind
of
its
own
personal
trust
accounts
it
could
invest
that
in
the
account.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
i
think
it
does
because
it
does
have
any
interest
in
the
fund.
and
in
addition
to
that
the
prospectus
of
the
fund
says
that
the
commingled
account
will
not
borrow
any
money
so
that
as
far
as
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
fund?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
from
anybody,
that’s
right.
the
account
is
to
be
operated
with
the
monies
that
the
participants
have
put
into
the
account.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
that’s
specifically
in
section
--
first
of
all
in
section
17
of
the
investment
company
act.
section
17
of
the
investment
company
act
prohibits
transactions
between
affiliates
and
under
the
terms
of
the
investment
company
act,
the
bank
and
the
fund
are
affiliates.
so
there’s
an
absolute
bar
in
that
section.
in
addition
to
that,
i
think
the
provision
saying
the
banks
--
saying
that
the
bank
shall
not
have
any
interest
in
the
fund
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
sale,
well
there
are
other
--
prohibits
the
sale.
are
you
speaking
i
take
it
of
the
security
side,
that
the
bank
were
to
sell
a
security.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
that
again
would
depend
on
the
circumstances.
there
is
a
provision
of
the
controller’s
regulation
section
9.12
filling
with
what
is
called
self
dealing
and
it
says
funds
helps
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
did
not
say
that
it
does
not
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
there
was
such,
it
might
affect
the
exercise
of
the
best
judge,
it
provides
--
if
the
instrument
authorizes
that
these
instruments
do
not
authorize
this
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
that
would
have
to
again
be
submitted
to
the
controller.
the
controller
would
have
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don’t
know
of
any
specific
provision
in
those
circumstances
other
than
the
fact
that
the
bank
cannot
make
any
investment,
have
any
interest
in
the
fund.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don’t
know
mr.
justice
but
i
would
assume
that
new
york
being
a
very
enlightened
state
does.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
the
whole
question
of
self
dealing
is
another
problem
in
this
which
is
the
bank
is
a
fiduciary
and
its
relationships
with
the
participants
in
the
account.
and
if
what
the
bank
does,
if
it
should
sell
something
to
the
account
in
a
way
they
violate
its
fiduciary
obligations,
i
would
think
that
the
bank
would
run
afoul
of
that
and
of
course
the
controllers
constantly
inspecting
these
banks,
and
inspects
them
three
times
every
two
years.
it's
trust
department
inspects
the
account
of
the
bank.
and
as
a
result
of
this,
if
they
soar
any
existence
of
this
self
dealing,
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
quickly
corrected.
so
that
on
balance
as
i
say,
we
think
that
this
is
an
area
within
the
commission’s
discretion,
and
that
the
commission
has
not
abused
its
discretion
in
granting
the
exemption
here.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
justice
black
and
may
it
please
the
court.
although
the
court
was
sharply
divided
last
year
in
the
data
processing
case,
now
what
is
the
appropriate
basis
for
determining
standing
to
challenge.
the
court
was
unanimous
in
another
preposition
and
that
is
that
assuming
the
plaintiff
had
standing
before
a
plaintiff
can
prevail
on
the
merits,
he
must
show
that
the
conduct
of
which
he
complains
has
invaded
a
legal
interest,
a
legal
interest
to
the
plaintiff.
i
just
like,
if
i
may,
to
refer
to
both
of
the
statement
in
the
majority
opinion
and
in
mr.
justice
brennan’s
concurring
and
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
white
joined.
in
the
majority
opinion,
at
the
very
end
of
the
opinion,
the
court
says,
"whether
anything
in
the
bank
service
corporation
act
or
the
national
bank
act
gives
petitioners
a
legal
interest
that
protects
him
against
violation
of
those
acts
and
whether
the
actions
of
respondent
did
in
fact
violate
either
of
those
acts,
a
question
which
go
to
the
merits
and
remained
to
be
decided
below.
and
the
sanctual
as
expressed
in
the
concurring
and
dissenting
opinion
which
after
saying
--
that
after
you
get
past
the
standing
question,
you
have
to
inquire
one
of
the
questions
on
the
merits
whether
the
specific
legal
interest
claimed
by
the
plaintiff
is
protected
by
the
statute."
that's
the
first
question
before
you
decide,
you
have
to
show,
it
seems
to
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
before
you
reach
the
question
whether
or
not,
the
conduct
challenged
violated
the
statute,
you
have
to
show
that
the
plaintiff
had
a
legal
interest
which
the
statute
was
designed
to
protect.
now
we
think
that
in
this
case,
the
petitioners
have
not
shown
that
any
legal
interest
of
theirs,
that
the
glass-steagall
gives
them
any
legal
interest
that
was
intended
to
be
protected
against
violation.
what
is
the
legal
interest
which
they
claim
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
mr.
justice,
we
think
we
--
i
guess
agree
with
the
petitioners
that
in
the
light
of
this
court’s
recent
decision
in
the
arnold
tours
case,
that
case
appears
to
hold
that
it
the
situation
where
a
competitor
of
a
bank
is
complaining
of
something
the
bank
is
doing,
the
bank
has
standing
to
challenge
that
in
the
light
of
the
banks
service
act.
we
have
argued
in
our
brief
however
which
we
filed
before
the
arnold
tours
case,
we
argued
not
only
the
question
of
standing
but
also
the
question
of
legal
interest
and
indeed,
the
petitioners
have
never
attempted
to
answer
us
on
legal
interest.
all
they
say
about
legal
interest
is
they
have
a
statement
in
the
footnote
saying,
“legal
interest
goes
to
the
merits.”
we
agree
it
goes
to
the
merits
and
we
think
they
had
not
sustained
their
burden
on
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
we’re
not
challenge
the
standing
mr.
justice
with
questioning.
we’re
challenging
their
right
to
any
relief
because
they
had
not
shown
that
the
statute
which
they
claim
has
been
misinterpreted
by
the
comptroller
invades
any
legal
interest
of
theirs,
and
we
think
that
those
two
as
this
court
has
recognized
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that’s
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that’s
correct.
that’s
why
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
even
though
--
they
can
get
to
--
they
get
to
the
plate,
but
they
don’t
get
the
first
base
we
think.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
could
well.
the
arnold
tours
case
has
not
been
decided
on
the
merits.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
mr.
justice.
this
court
has
said
that
there
is
the
public
interest
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
--
that’s
correct.
we
are
arguing
on
arnold
tours
that
has
been
in
the
lower
courts,
we’re
arguing
there
has
been
no
invasion
of
any
legally
protected
interest.
i’d
like
to
just
specifically
refer
the
court
to
the
basis,
the
basis
on
which
they
claim
that
a
legal
interest
of
theirs
has
been
violated.
it's
paragraph
18
of
the
complaint
on
page
15
where
they
describe
their
injury
and
what
they
say
is
that
this
action
of
the
comptroller
will
deprive
the
members
of
the
institute
of
legitimate
business
will
dilute,
divert
and
withdraw
a
substantial
portion
of
the
potential
market
for
securities
and
mutual
funds,
and
the
same
claim
has
made
in
behalf
of
the
investment
advisor
members
of
the
institute.
they
say
there’s
going
to
be
a
loss
of
opportunities
for
profit
in
their
trade
and
will
dilute,
divert
and
withdraw
a
substantial
portion
of
the
potential
market
for
their
services.
those
what
they’re
saying
is
that
the
glass-steagall
act
somehow
guarantees
to
them
that
they
will
be
free
of
the
competition
of
this
new
type
of
investment
immediate.
now,
there’s
nothing
in
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
they
haven’t
--
i
reaffirm
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
are
asking
for
judicial
review
and
they’re
asking
to
have
the
agency
action
reversed
and
we
said
they
are
entitled
to
have
the
court
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
suggest
mr.
justice
before
the
court
gets
to
consider
whether
the
agency
is
wrong,
they
have
to
satisfy
what
the
court
said
at
the
end
of
the
opinion.
they
also
have
to
show
a
legally
protected
interest.
it's
our
position
that
there’s
nothing
in
either
the
glass-steagall
act
or
the
banking
act
that
suggests
that
these
acts
were
intended
to
protect
investors
or
competitors
from
this
alleged
type
of
injury.
the
legislative
history
is
quite
clear
on
this.
we’ve
cited
at
page
28
a
statement
from
senator
bulkley
who
is
one
of
the
managers
of
the
bill
in
which
he
said
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
“the
purpose
of
this
bill
does
not
extend
to
safeguarding
practices
of
securities
as
such.”
the
object
of
the
inhibitions
which
i
am
discussing
here
is
not
primarily
to
protect
the
investment
of
public,
although
that
is
a
worthy
purpose,
but
our
field
is
to
protect
the
operations
of
the
banking
system
itself
and
to
protect
the
depositors
and
customers
of
the
banks
so
that
they
shall
have
the
service
from
national
and
state
member
banks
which
they
are
entitled
to
expect.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
i
think
mr.
justice,
the
doctrine
of
private
attorneys
general
has
developed
in
cases
arising
under
statutes
where
congress
specifically
permitted
any
person
aggrieved
or
affected
to
seek
judicial
review,
and
we
think
those
provisions
reflect
a
congressional
determination
that
in
that
type
of
situation,
anyone
who
is
aggrieved
or
injured
in
fact
has
standing
to
challenge.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
believe
they’re
not
seeking
damages,
but
they’re
seeking
to
set
aside
the
comptrollers
order.
but
again,
it
seems
to
me
the
data
processing
case
was
no
claim
for
damages.
again,
it
was
an
attempt
to
set
aside
equitably
the
action
of
the
comptroller.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
what
depends
on
which
way
you
approach
the
case
and
if
may
just
add
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
their
right
--
we
think
the
only
right
they
have
mr.
justice
is
to
first,
before
they
get
to
the
merits,
they
have
to
show
that
congress
that
this
statute
is
intended
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
don’t
think
there
is
any
way
for
them
to
win
mr.
justice
on
two
counts.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
think
they
can’t
win
for
two
reasons.
one
they
haven’t
shown
that
there’s
any
intention
in
this
statute
to
protect
their
monopoly
position
against
competition
and
secondly,
which
i’ve
now
like
to
get
to,
we
think
on
the
merits,
the
comptroller
was
correct
in
his
decision.
i’d
like
to
turn
to
that
if
i
may
and
i
will
discuss
primarily
the
application
of
a
glass-steagall
act
and
mr.
cox
will
continue
with
some
discussions
of
the
glass-steagall
act
and
we’ll
also
argue
the
proposition
that
what
the
bank
has
done
here
is
--
constitutes
an
authorized
fiduciary
service
within
the
meaning
of
section
92
(a)
of
the
banking
act.
now,
the
glass-steagall
act
was
passed
in
1933
because
of
the
numerous
things
that
had
developed
in
the
1920’s
which
had
brought
the
country’s
banking
system
to
such
a
deplorable
past.
and
the
particular
provisions
that
we’re
dealing
with
here
where
it
reflect
the
concern
of
congress
with
the
bank’s
speculation
in
that
period
in
securities
through
so
called
securities
affiliates
that
the
banks
organized.
and
the
way
congress
struck
at
this
problem,
the
way
congress
tried
to
prevent
a
repetition
of
this
problem
was
to
separate
commercial
and
investment
banking.
there
are
four
different
sections
as
mr.
--
what
was
that?
mr.
vieth
has
said,
i’m
sorry,
they
all
basically
i
think
involved
the
same
proposition
and
i
think
we
can
fairly
focus
here
on
section
21
which
prohibits
the
banks
from
engaging
in
the
business
of
issuing,
underwriting,
selling
or
distributing
stocks,
bonds,
debentures,
notes
or
other
securities.
the
question
as
we
see
it
is
whether
in
the
light
of
the
congressional
purposes
in
glass-steagall,
the
bank’s
operation
of
this
account
is
engaging
in
the
business
of
issuing,
underwriting,
selling,
or
distributing
securities,
it
seems
to
us
quite
irrelevant
that
under
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
legislation,
these
receipts
that
are
given
to
our
securities
and
that
the
fund
may
be
viewed
as
the
issue
of
securities.
as
judge
bazelon
explained
the
two
sets
of
statutes
perform
different
functions
and
they
are
not
to
be
interpreted
identically.
certainly,
congress
didn’t
intend
the
very
broad
definition
of
security
automatically
to
be
carried
over
the
glass-steagall
because
if
that
happened,
many
of
the
bank’s
normal
activities
that
it
engages
in
everyday
might
run
afoul
of
this
proposition.
we
think
when
congress
used
these
words
engaging
in
a
business
of
issuing,
underwriting,
distributing
or
selling
securities;
it
used
them
to
mean
the
kind
of
thing
that
the
banks
had
been
doing
in
the
1920’s.
that
is
underwriting
and
selling
securities
through
the
affiliates
for
the
banks
own
profits
so
the
bank
could
make
a
profit
on
buying
and
selling
securities.
that
is
not
this
case.
in
this
case,
the
bank's
sole
compensation
from
this
account
comes
from
the
usual
fee
that
it
receives
as
a
fiduciary,
a
percentage
of
the
account
that
it
handles.
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
precisely
mr.
justice.
the
basic
purpose
of
these
provisions
that
we’re
dealing
with,
there
are
other
phases
of
glass-steagall,
but
we
think
that
was
precisely
that
purpose.
the
senate
committee
report
that
we’ve
quoted
referred
to
these
affiliates
having
engaged
in
parlous
underwriting
operations,
stock
speculation,
and
maintaining
a
market
for
the
bank's
own
stock.
now,
in
this
situation,
the
bank
cannot
make
loans
to
the
affiliate.
the
account
buys
the
securities
not
for
the
bank’s
account,
but
for
the
account
of
the
customers.
the
customers
obviously
will
measure
the
performance
of
the
bank’s
account
against
those
of
other
mutual
funds.
in
other
words,
if
the
bank
would
have
tried
to
use
this
account
for
the
kind
of
mischief
that
the
banks
had
engaged
in
the
20’s,
the
very
nature
of
the
account
will
prevent
the
bank
from
doing
it.
now,
the
bank
basically
here,
it
seems
to
us,
is
doing
what
it
has
done
for
many,
many
years.
it’s
handling
other
people’s
money,
investing
it,
giving
advice.
it’s
a
traditional
banking
function
which
we
think
congress
in
the
glass-steagall
act
did
not
intend
to
bar.
for
example,
the
alleged
evils
to
which
the
petitioners
point
in
this
case,
the
claims
of
possible
misuse
by
the
bank
of
the
bank’s
assets
because
of
its
control
of
the
account
are
identical
where
the
bank
handles
$200,000.00
for
a
single
customer
whom
he
has
undertaken
to
represent
and
managing
its
investments,
or
if
it
handles
the
same
$200,000.00
for
20
customers,
each
of
whom
contributes
$10,000.00.
the
evil
is
identical
in
both
of
those
cases.
it’s
conceded
and
the
bank
for
many
years
has
had
the
authority
to
invest
the
$200,000.00,
but
now
we
are
told
somehow
that
when
the
bank
attempts
to
make
available
to
the
smaller
investors,
the
same
kind
of
investment
service,
it
is
hitherto
provided
for
the
larger
investments,
congress
must
to
prevented
this
in
the
glass-steagall
act.
it
is
already
been
referenced
to
the
fact
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there’s
obviously
a
difference
mr.
justice,
but
i’m
addressing
myself
in
terms
of
the
evils
to
which
glass-steagall
was
directed.
the
possibility
of
conflicting
interest,
the
possibility
of
misuse
by
the
bank
of
the
capital
that
it
has
received
in
a
fiduciary
capacity,
the
misuse
it
could
make
because
of
its
investment
facilities.
what
i’m
arguing
is
that
that
misuse
is
no
less
present
in
the
case
of
a
$200,000.00
fund
than
in
the
case
of
20
$10,000.00
or
indeed
i
may
take
it
one
step
beyond
this,
the
banks
for
at
least
15
years
have
been
permitted
to
commingle
pension
trust.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
to
commingle
pension
trust.
they
can
take
several
pension
trusts
and
put
them
into
one
pool
of
capital.
the
amount
of
money
i
understand
today
in
pension
trust
and
employee
profit
sharing
plans
runs
into
the
billions,
much
more
than
the
amount
that’s
even
talked
of
as
likely
to
result
in
this
bank
investment
accounts.
and
again,
if
the
bank
is
likely
to
be
up
to
mischief,
one
would
have
thought
this
would
have
provided
a
fertile
field.
the
letter
that
is
quoted
by
judge
bazelon
that
mr.
cox
has
set
forth
in
his
appendix
from
chairman
martin
of
the
federal
reserve
board
states
that
their
experience
has
been
that
the
banks
have
not
done
this
kind
of
thing.
then,
we
have
the
other
example
which
has
been
discussed
the
so-called
common
trust
funds.
once
again,
a
small
trust,
it’s
not
feasible
for
the
bank
to
give
the
kind
of
management
to
provide
the
kind
of
service
on
that
smaller
basis.
this
bank
has
told
us
it
can’t
provide
individual
investment
service
for
less
than
$200,000.00,
so
they’re
have
been
permitted
now
for
many
years
to
commingle
with
common
trust
funds
into
a
pool
which
to
all
intents
and
purposes
and
in
terms
of
its
affect
and
in
terms
of
the
possibilities
for
misdoing
is
the
same
is
this
pool
here.
now,
there’s
a
further
affirmative
factor
on
this
phase
of
the
case,
and
that
is
that
this
type
of
thing,
this
making
available
to
the
small
investor
a
type
of
investment
service
that
is
not
hitherto
been
available,
makes
available
to
these
people
a
new
opportunity
to
invest
their
money
to
get
the
kind
of
service
for
the
small
investors
that
hitherto
was
only
been
available
for
the
large.
it
is
true,
it
is
true
that
there
are
so-called
no
load
mutual
funds
which
the
man
does
not
have
to
pay
to
get
in,
but
these
are
the
minority.
i
think
the
briefs
indicate
that
95%
of
all
investment
companies
of
the
so-called
load
funds
where
the
man
has
to
pay
a
commission
of
7%
or
8%
to
get
into
it.
now,
there
are
many
small
investors
who
may
feel
that
they
prefer
the
stability,
the
reliability,
the
conservatism
that
is
traditionally
associated
with
banks,
and
i
would
think
they
would
welcome
the
opportunity
to
have
this
service
made
available
to
them
and
this
is
basically
what
the
bank
service
is
doing
here.
it’s
making
available
to
the
small
investor
the
kind
of
investment
advice
that
he
is
not
hitherto
had
it’s
doing
it
under
a
--
it’s
fiduciary
powers
and
it
seems
to
us,
there’s
a
strong
public
interest
in
making
this
competing
form
of
investment
by
its
service
available.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
justice
black
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i
would
just
like
to
explain
in
view
of
the
somewhat
unusual
posture
of
this
case
that
the
commission
is
not
appearing
here
in
defense
of
its
order
one,
why
the
united
states
is
appearing
in
this
case
and
secondly,
why
we
think
that
the
commission’s
position
in
this
case
does
not
undermine
the
validity
of
it’s
decision.
as
it’s
been
indicated
when
the
commission
granted
this
exemption
in
1966,
the
vote
was
four
to
one
with
a
strong
dissent
against
the
grant
of
the
exemption
by
commissioner
badge.
the
commission
vigorously
defended
its
order
early
in
1967
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
that
court
unanimously
upheld
the
order.
now,
by
the
time
the
case
reach
this
court
however
and
this
court
had
granted
the
petition
there
had
been
a
significant
change
in
the
membership
of
the
commission.
three
of
the
five
commissioners
who
had
originally
participated
in
the
case
were
no
longer
on
the
commission
and
of
the
remaining
two,
one
is
mr.
bage(ph)
who
by
that
point
had
become
chairman,
had
voted
against
the
exemption
that
the
other
commissioner
had
voted
in
favor
of
it.
and
it
was
in
that
posture
that
the
commission
advised
the
solicitor
general
in
june
of
1970,
that
it
was
taking
a
position
in
this
case.
this
is
the
statement
that
mr.
levin
read
to
the
court
yesterday
from
page
three
of
the
government’s
brief.
and
i
just
like
to
reiterate
two
of
the
sentences
that
the
commission
included
in
its
statement.
the
commission
said,
the
three
subsequently
appointed
members
of
the
commission
are
not
prepared
to
take
any
position.
this
was
after
the
commission
had
pointed
out
that
there
are
only
two
remaining
members.
and
one
was
--
had
voted
for
and
one
had
voted
against
the
exemption.
accordingly,
the
commission
expresses
no
position
on
the
merits
and
urges
neither
affirmance
nor
reversal
of
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
we
think
what
in
effect
the
commission
has
said
to
us
in
this
case
is
that
it
is
not
able
at
this
time
to
master
a
quorum
to
decide
what
position
to
take
in
this
case.
only
two
members
of
the
commission
at
that
point
were
prepared
to
vote
on
what
to
say.
we
strongly
disagree
with
mr.
levin’s
characterization
of
the
commission’s
action
yesterday
as
that
the
commission
had
disavowed
its
decision.
the
commission
has
not
disavowed
its
decision.
if
i
may
just
mix
an
athletic
metaphor
for
a
moment.
the
commission
in
this
case
contrary
to
petitioner's
suggestion
has
not
thrown
in
the
tile
on
this
case.
it
is
merely
sitting
this
one
out
on
the
sidelines.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
all
of
the
commissions
to
this
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
it’s
the
one
that
says
there’s
no
assurance
that
the
commission
would
reach
the
same
judgment
if
a
similar
matter
is
again
presented.
i
think
that
merely
is
a
rather
briefer
statement
of
what
was
said
in
the
original
brief
that
is
as
of
that
time
the
commission
didn’t
know
what
its
position
would
be
because
there
are
only
two
of
the
original
commissioners
then
available.
i
would
like
to
just
say
that
the
commission
has
not
disavowed
its
decision
and
it
seems
to
us
that
basically,
the
validity
of
the
commission's
action
must
be
determined
on
what
happened
when
it
acted.
not
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
sometime
thereafter
there
had
been
changes
in
the
membership
of
the
agency
and
that
the
present
membership
is
not
prepared
now
to
state,
what
position
it
would
take
if
the
issue
came
before.
indeed,
there's
another
change
in
the
offering
in
the
commission.
we
talked
about
shifts
in
membership.
chairman
badge
who
was
the
lone
dissenter
has
announced
his
retirement.
so
that
presumably
by
the
time
this
case
gets
back
to
the
commission,
there’ll
only
be
one
of
the
original
commissioners
and
we
think
that
the
commission
by
definition
is
a
continuing
body.
it
continues
as
an
entity
without
regard
to
changes
in
its
membership.
and
that
if
the
commission’s
action
was
valid
when
it
was
taken,
it
should
be
upheld
even
though
changes
in
the
body
since
that
time
might
suggest
that
if
the
commission
would
have
considered
anew,
the
commission
might
come
up
the
other
way.
the
commission
in
this
case
has
not
asked
this
court
to
remand
the
case
--
for
it
to
take
another
look
at
the
case.
and
i
think
the
reason
it
hasn’t
done
that
is
again
the
same
reason
that
there
is
no
majority
of
the
commission
that
it’s
prepared
to
take
any
position
at
this
time.
so
that
in
these
circumstances
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
this
case
you
mean?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice.
we
were
not
but
we
came
in
to
the
case
because
it
was
our
belief
that
in
view
of
the
importance
of
this
issue
and
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
unanimously
upheld
the
commission’s
order,
we
thought
it
was
not
appropriate
that
the
validity
of
the
audit
should
just
be
defended
by
the
bank
which
had
received
the
exemption.
we
thought
there
is
an
interest
to
this.
and
in
addition
to
that
although
we
haven’t
set
it
forth
in
our
brief,
the
government,
the
solicitor
general
representing
all
government
agencies
has
an
interest
in
the
basic
legal
issue
here
which
is
the
scope
of
judicial
review
of
an
agency
or
granting
an
exemption,
a
question
that
this
court
has
not
directly
dealt
with
as
far
as
i
know.
well,
this
is
the
way
of
background
as
to
why
we
think
it
was
appropriate
to
give
weight
to
the
discretion
of
the
commission
in
this
case
even
though
the
commission
is
not
here
appearing.
in
defense
of
its
order,
i’d
like
to
turn
briefly
to
the
merits
which
mr.
cocks
has
fully
covered.
and
why
we
think
that
in
this
case,
the
commission
clearly
has
not
abused
its
discretion.
the
statute
under
which
the
commission
granted
this
exemption
section
6(c)
gives
the
commission
authority
in
the
broadest
possible
terms
that
allows
it
to
exempt
any
person,
any
transaction
from
any
class
of
persons,
from
any
provision
of
the
statute.
it
couldn’t
be
broader.
and
there
is
certainly
nothing
in
that
sweeping
language
that
in
anyway
suggests
that
section
10
of
the
act
is
not
within
the
commission’s
power
to
exempt.
what
we
think
the
congress
is
obviously
contemplated
by
this
section
is
that
the
commission
shall
have
authority
to
exempt
any
transaction,
any
person,
any
security
within
its
terms,
if
the
particular
thing
for
which
exemption
is
sought
comes
within
these
public
interest
factors
that
are
listed
as
the
conditions
for
the
exemption.
that
is
if
the
exemption
is
necessary
or
appropriate
in
the
public
interest,
consistent
with
the
protection
of
investors
and
the
purpose
is
fairly
intended
by
the
policy
and
provisions
of
the
act.
now,
the
determination,
the
weighing
of
these
many
factors
that
make
up
to
this
broad
public
interest
standard
is
of
necessity,
something
that
calls
for
a
very
difficult,
close,
and
subtle
factors
of
balancing
of
judgment.
this
is
not
the
kind
of
thing
that
is
capable
of
precise
measurement,
exactly.
you
can’t
take
a
yardstick
and
say
whether
it
reaches
a
certain
point
and
therefore
is
or
is
not
consistent
with
the
public
interest.
the
granting
of
an
exemption,
the
decision
whether
or
not
the
public
interest
standards
are
met
in
this
kind
of
a
case
is
really
the
essence
of
administrative
discretion.
it’s
the
kind
of
thing
that
necessarily
has
to
be
within
the
discretion
of
the
agency.
and
we
have
developed
in
our
brief
and
as
mr.
cox
has
indicated
at
some
length,
the
commission
certainly
in
this
case
did
not
abuse
its
discretion.
the
basic
evils
at
which
10
section
(c)
was
directed
are
not
the
evils
present
here.
section
10(c)
was
put
into
the
act
because
of
a
lot
of
abuses
that
had
been
shown
to
have
taken
place
in
the
1920’s
in
the
way
in
which
the
banks
operated
these
investment
affiliates.
what
the
banks
were
doing,
they
were
using
the
investment
affiliates
as
methods
for
speculating
in
the
securities
market
and
they
were
unloading
on
the
investment
companies,
a
lot
of
the
speculative
securities.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
bank
cannot
make
a
loan
to
the
account
or
the
fund,
that
is
correct.
there
are
several
reasons
for
this
first
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
assume
that
that
is
basically
–
if
for
some
short
term
basis
is
something
like
that
but
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
justice
if
i
may
retract
my
statement.
i’ve
been
informed
that
relates
to
an
individual
account.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
does
not
deal
with
this
type
of
account.
that’s
the
controller’s
mind
that’s
informed
me.
if
i
may
explain
several
things
first
of
all
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
regulation
9
broadly
governs
all
fiduciary
activities
of
banks.
it’s
regulation
9.18
which
specifically
deals
with
commingled
accounts.
this
regulation
9
is
the
general
regulation
which
affects
the
bank's
control
and
operation
of
fiduciary
activities.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
no,
no.
i’m
not.
i’m
saying
that
regulation
9
generally
governs
the
banks
fiduciary
applications.
and
to
whatever
extent
it’s
covered
by
regulation
9
generally,
of
course
it’s
applicable
then
in
addition
to
that
the
controller
has
promulgated
special
regulations
dealing
with
commingled
accounts
which
is
9.18
which
imposes
certain
obligations
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
market-market
more
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
so,
9.18
if
i
may
point
out.
a
couple
of
things,
first
of
all
9.18
specifically
prohibits
the
bank
from
having
any
interest
in
the
account.
and
in
addition
to
that,
the
account's
own
prospectus
states
that
it
will
not
borrow
any
money
at
all.
and
finally
there
are
provisions
of
the
investment
company
act
which
specifically
prohibit
transactions
between
affiliates
at
section
17
of
the
investment
company
act
would
prohibit
the
bank
from
selling
securities
or
loaning
money
to
the
account.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
it
does
not
apply
mr.
justice
for
one
reason
which
is
that
the
arrangement
between
the
participants
and
the
bank
does
not
permit
this.
and
in
addition
to
that,
that
the
hope
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
but
it’s
not
--
9.18
in
turn
has
prohibitions
against
the
bank.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i’m
afraid
i
don’t
have
9.18
in
my
brief
in
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that’s
section
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
believe,
i’m
trying
--
it’s
section
9.18
b8i.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
let
me
see
if
i
can
find
that
in
mr.
cox’s
brief.
yes.
it’s
on
page
25
(a)
of
mr.
cox’s
brief
at
paragraph
a.
and
it
says,
a
bank
administering
a
collective
investment
fund
shall
not
have
(a)
any
interest
in
such
fund
other
than
in
a
fiduciary
capacity
or
(b)
make
any
loans
on
the
security
of
a
participation
in
search
fund,
so
it
prohibits
the
bank
from
having
any
interest
in
the
fund
except
in
a
fiduciary
capacity.
that
is
if
the
bank
itself
had
some
money
for
one
of
its
--
in
mind
of
its
own
personal
trust
accounts
it
could
invest
that
in
the
account.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
i
think
it
does
because
it
does
have
any
interest
in
the
fund.
and
in
addition
to
that
the
prospectus
of
the
fund
says
that
the
commingled
account
will
not
borrow
any
money
so
that
as
far
as
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
fund?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
from
anybody,
that’s
right.
the
account
is
to
be
operated
with
the
monies
that
the
participants
have
put
into
the
account.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
that’s
specifically
in
section
--
first
of
all
in
section
17
of
the
investment
company
act.
section
17
of
the
investment
company
act
prohibits
transactions
between
affiliates
and
under
the
terms
of
the
investment
company
act,
the
bank
and
the
fund
are
affiliates.
so
there’s
an
absolute
bar
in
that
section.
in
addition
to
that,
i
think
the
provision
saying
the
banks
--
saying
that
the
bank
shall
not
have
any
interest
in
the
fund
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
sale,
well
there
are
other
--
prohibits
the
sale.
are
you
speaking
i
take
it
of
the
security
side,
that
the
bank
were
to
sell
a
security.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
that
again
would
depend
on
the
circumstances.
there
is
a
provision
of
the
controller’s
regulation
section
9.12
filling
with
what
is
called
self
dealing
and
it
says
funds
helps
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
did
not
say
that
it
does
not
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
there
was
such,
it
might
affect
the
exercise
of
the
best
judge,
it
provides
--
if
the
instrument
authorizes
that
these
instruments
do
not
authorize
this
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
that
would
have
to
again
be
submitted
to
the
controller.
the
controller
would
have
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don’t
know
of
any
specific
provision
in
those
circumstances
other
than
the
fact
that
the
bank
cannot
make
any
investment,
have
any
interest
in
the
fund.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don’t
know
mr.
justice
but
i
would
assume
that
new
york
being
a
very
enlightened
state
does.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
the
whole
question
of
self
dealing
is
another
problem
in
this
which
is
the
bank
is
a
fiduciary
and
its
relationships
with
the
participants
in
the
account.
and
if
what
the
bank
does,
if
it
should
sell
something
to
the
account
in
a
way
they
violate
its
fiduciary
obligations,
i
would
think
that
the
bank
would
run
afoul
of
that
and
of
course
the
controllers
constantly
inspecting
these
banks,
and
inspects
them
three
times
every
two
years.
it's
trust
department
inspects
the
account
of
the
bank.
and
as
a
result
of
this,
if
they
soar
any
existence
of
this
self
dealing,
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
quickly
corrected.
so
that
on
balance
as
i
say,
we
think
that
this
is
an
area
within
the
commission’s
discretion,
and
that
the
commission
has
not
abused
its
discretion
in
granting
the
exemption
here.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
justice
black
and
may
it
please
the
court.
although
the
court
was
sharply
divided
last
year
in
the
data
processing
case,
now
what
is
the
appropriate
basis
for
determining
standing
to
challenge.
the
court
was
unanimous
in
another
preposition
and
that
is
that
assuming
the
plaintiff
had
standing
before
a
plaintiff
can
prevail
on
the
merits,
he
must
show
that
the
conduct
of
which
he
complains
has
invaded
a
legal
interest,
a
legal
interest
to
the
plaintiff.
i
just
like,
if
i
may,
to
refer
to
both
of
the
statement
in
the
majority
opinion
and
in
mr.
justice
brennan’s
concurring
and
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
white
joined.
in
the
majority
opinion,
at
the
very
end
of
the
opinion,
the
court
says,
"whether
anything
in
the
bank
service
corporation
act
or
the
national
bank
act
gives
petitioners
a
legal
interest
that
protects
him
against
violation
of
those
acts
and
whether
the
actions
of
respondent
did
in
fact
violate
either
of
those
acts,
a
question
which
go
to
the
merits
and
remained
to
be
decided
below.
and
the
sanctual
as
expressed
in
the
concurring
and
dissenting
opinion
which
after
saying
--
that
after
you
get
past
the
standing
question,
you
have
to
inquire
one
of
the
questions
on
the
merits
whether
the
specific
legal
interest
claimed
by
the
plaintiff
is
protected
by
the
statute."
that's
the
first
question
before
you
decide,
you
have
to
show,
it
seems
to
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
before
you
reach
the
question
whether
or
not,
the
conduct
challenged
violated
the
statute,
you
have
to
show
that
the
plaintiff
had
a
legal
interest
which
the
statute
was
designed
to
protect.
now
we
think
that
in
this
case,
the
petitioners
have
not
shown
that
any
legal
interest
of
theirs,
that
the
glass-steagall
gives
them
any
legal
interest
that
was
intended
to
be
protected
against
violation.
what
is
the
legal
interest
which
they
claim
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
mr.
justice,
we
think
we
--
i
guess
agree
with
the
petitioners
that
in
the
light
of
this
court’s
recent
decision
in
the
arnold
tours
case,
that
case
appears
to
hold
that
it
the
situation
where
a
competitor
of
a
bank
is
complaining
of
something
the
bank
is
doing,
the
bank
has
standing
to
challenge
that
in
the
light
of
the
banks
service
act.
we
have
argued
in
our
brief
however
which
we
filed
before
the
arnold
tours
case,
we
argued
not
only
the
question
of
standing
but
also
the
question
of
legal
interest
and
indeed,
the
petitioners
have
never
attempted
to
answer
us
on
legal
interest.
all
they
say
about
legal
interest
is
they
have
a
statement
in
the
footnote
saying,
“legal
interest
goes
to
the
merits.”
we
agree
it
goes
to
the
merits
and
we
think
they
had
not
sustained
their
burden
on
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
we’re
not
challenge
the
standing
mr.
justice
with
questioning.
we’re
challenging
their
right
to
any
relief
because
they
had
not
shown
that
the
statute
which
they
claim
has
been
misinterpreted
by
the
comptroller
invades
any
legal
interest
of
theirs,
and
we
think
that
those
two
as
this
court
has
recognized
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that’s
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that’s
correct.
that’s
why
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
even
though
--
they
can
get
to
--
they
get
to
the
plate,
but
they
don’t
get
the
first
base
we
think.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
could
well.
the
arnold
tours
case
has
not
been
decided
on
the
merits.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
mr.
justice.
this
court
has
said
that
there
is
the
public
interest
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
--
that’s
correct.
we
are
arguing
on
arnold
tours
that
has
been
in
the
lower
courts,
we’re
arguing
there
has
been
no
invasion
of
any
legally
protected
interest.
i’d
like
to
just
specifically
refer
the
court
to
the
basis,
the
basis
on
which
they
claim
that
a
legal
interest
of
theirs
has
been
violated.
it's
paragraph
18
of
the
complaint
on
page
15
where
they
describe
their
injury
and
what
they
say
is
that
this
action
of
the
comptroller
will
deprive
the
members
of
the
institute
of
legitimate
business
will
dilute,
divert
and
withdraw
a
substantial
portion
of
the
potential
market
for
securities
and
mutual
funds,
and
the
same
claim
has
made
in
behalf
of
the
investment
advisor
members
of
the
institute.
they
say
there’s
going
to
be
a
loss
of
opportunities
for
profit
in
their
trade
and
will
dilute,
divert
and
withdraw
a
substantial
portion
of
the
potential
market
for
their
services.
those
what
they’re
saying
is
that
the
glass-steagall
act
somehow
guarantees
to
them
that
they
will
be
free
of
the
competition
of
this
new
type
of
investment
immediate.
now,
there’s
nothing
in
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
they
haven’t
--
i
reaffirm
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
are
asking
for
judicial
review
and
they’re
asking
to
have
the
agency
action
reversed
and
we
said
they
are
entitled
to
have
the
court
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
suggest
mr.
justice
before
the
court
gets
to
consider
whether
the
agency
is
wrong,
they
have
to
satisfy
what
the
court
said
at
the
end
of
the
opinion.
they
also
have
to
show
a
legally
protected
interest.
it's
our
position
that
there’s
nothing
in
either
the
glass-steagall
act
or
the
banking
act
that
suggests
that
these
acts
were
intended
to
protect
investors
or
competitors
from
this
alleged
type
of
injury.
the
legislative
history
is
quite
clear
on
this.
we’ve
cited
at
page
28
a
statement
from
senator
bulkley
who
is
one
of
the
managers
of
the
bill
in
which
he
said
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
“the
purpose
of
this
bill
does
not
extend
to
safeguarding
practices
of
securities
as
such.”
the
object
of
the
inhibitions
which
i
am
discussing
here
is
not
primarily
to
protect
the
investment
of
public,
although
that
is
a
worthy
purpose,
but
our
field
is
to
protect
the
operations
of
the
banking
system
itself
and
to
protect
the
depositors
and
customers
of
the
banks
so
that
they
shall
have
the
service
from
national
and
state
member
banks
which
they
are
entitled
to
expect.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
i
think
mr.
justice,
the
doctrine
of
private
attorneys
general
has
developed
in
cases
arising
under
statutes
where
congress
specifically
permitted
any
person
aggrieved
or
affected
to
seek
judicial
review,
and
we
think
those
provisions
reflect
a
congressional
determination
that
in
that
type
of
situation,
anyone
who
is
aggrieved
or
injured
in
fact
has
standing
to
challenge.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
believe
they’re
not
seeking
damages,
but
they’re
seeking
to
set
aside
the
comptrollers
order.
but
again,
it
seems
to
me
the
data
processing
case
was
no
claim
for
damages.
again,
it
was
an
attempt
to
set
aside
equitably
the
action
of
the
comptroller.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
what
depends
on
which
way
you
approach
the
case
and
if
may
just
add
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
their
right
--
we
think
the
only
right
they
have
mr.
justice
is
to
first,
before
they
get
to
the
merits,
they
have
to
show
that
congress
that
this
statute
is
intended
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
don’t
think
there
is
any
way
for
them
to
win
mr.
justice
on
two
counts.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
think
they
can’t
win
for
two
reasons.
one
they
haven’t
shown
that
there’s
any
intention
in
this
statute
to
protect
their
monopoly
position
against
competition
and
secondly,
which
i’ve
now
like
to
get
to,
we
think
on
the
merits,
the
comptroller
was
correct
in
his
decision.
i’d
like
to
turn
to
that
if
i
may
and
i
will
discuss
primarily
the
application
of
a
glass-steagall
act
and
mr.
cox
will
continue
with
some
discussions
of
the
glass-steagall
act
and
we’ll
also
argue
the
proposition
that
what
the
bank
has
done
here
is
--
constitutes
an
authorized
fiduciary
service
within
the
meaning
of
section
92
(a)
of
the
banking
act.
now,
the
glass-steagall
act
was
passed
in
1933
because
of
the
numerous
things
that
had
developed
in
the
1920’s
which
had
brought
the
country’s
banking
system
to
such
a
deplorable
past.
and
the
particular
provisions
that
we’re
dealing
with
here
where
it
reflect
the
concern
of
congress
with
the
bank’s
speculation
in
that
period
in
securities
through
so
called
securities
affiliates
that
the
banks
organized.
and
the
way
congress
struck
at
this
problem,
the
way
congress
tried
to
prevent
a
repetition
of
this
problem
was
to
separate
commercial
and
investment
banking.
there
are
four
different
sections
as
mr.
--
what
was
that?
mr.
vieth
has
said,
i’m
sorry,
they
all
basically
i
think
involved
the
same
proposition
and
i
think
we
can
fairly
focus
here
on
section
21
which
prohibits
the
banks
from
engaging
in
the
business
of
issuing,
underwriting,
selling
or
distributing
stocks,
bonds,
debentures,
notes
or
other
securities.
the
question
as
we
see
it
is
whether
in
the
light
of
the
congressional
purposes
in
glass-steagall,
the
bank’s
operation
of
this
account
is
engaging
in
the
business
of
issuing,
underwriting,
selling,
or
distributing
securities,
it
seems
to
us
quite
irrelevant
that
under
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
legislation,
these
receipts
that
are
given
to
our
securities
and
that
the
fund
may
be
viewed
as
the
issue
of
securities.
as
judge
bazelon
explained
the
two
sets
of
statutes
perform
different
functions
and
they
are
not
to
be
interpreted
identically.
certainly,
congress
didn’t
intend
the
very
broad
definition
of
security
automatically
to
be
carried
over
the
glass-steagall
because
if
that
happened,
many
of
the
bank’s
normal
activities
that
it
engages
in
everyday
might
run
afoul
of
this
proposition.
we
think
when
congress
used
these
words
engaging
in
a
business
of
issuing,
underwriting,
distributing
or
selling
securities;
it
used
them
to
mean
the
kind
of
thing
that
the
banks
had
been
doing
in
the
1920’s.
that
is
underwriting
and
selling
securities
through
the
affiliates
for
the
banks
own
profits
so
the
bank
could
make
a
profit
on
buying
and
selling
securities.
that
is
not
this
case.
in
this
case,
the
bank's
sole
compensation
from
this
account
comes
from
the
usual
fee
that
it
receives
as
a
fiduciary,
a
percentage
of
the
account
that
it
handles.
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
precisely
mr.
justice.
the
basic
purpose
of
these
provisions
that
we’re
dealing
with,
there
are
other
phases
of
glass-steagall,
but
we
think
that
was
precisely
that
purpose.
the
senate
committee
report
that
we’ve
quoted
referred
to
these
affiliates
having
engaged
in
parlous
underwriting
operations,
stock
speculation,
and
maintaining
a
market
for
the
bank's
own
stock.
now,
in
this
situation,
the
bank
cannot
make
loans
to
the
affiliate.
the
account
buys
the
securities
not
for
the
bank’s
account,
but
for
the
account
of
the
customers.
the
customers
obviously
will
measure
the
performance
of
the
bank’s
account
against
those
of
other
mutual
funds.
in
other
words,
if
the
bank
would
have
tried
to
use
this
account
for
the
kind
of
mischief
that
the
banks
had
engaged
in
the
20’s,
the
very
nature
of
the
account
will
prevent
the
bank
from
doing
it.
now,
the
bank
basically
here,
it
seems
to
us,
is
doing
what
it
has
done
for
many,
many
years.
it’s
handling
other
people’s
money,
investing
it,
giving
advice.
it’s
a
traditional
banking
function
which
we
think
congress
in
the
glass-steagall
act
did
not
intend
to
bar.
for
example,
the
alleged
evils
to
which
the
petitioners
point
in
this
case,
the
claims
of
possible
misuse
by
the
bank
of
the
bank’s
assets
because
of
its
control
of
the
account
are
identical
where
the
bank
handles
$200,000.00
for
a
single
customer
whom
he
has
undertaken
to
represent
and
managing
its
investments,
or
if
it
handles
the
same
$200,000.00
for
20
customers,
each
of
whom
contributes
$10,000.00.
the
evil
is
identical
in
both
of
those
cases.
it’s
conceded
and
the
bank
for
many
years
has
had
the
authority
to
invest
the
$200,000.00,
but
now
we
are
told
somehow
that
when
the
bank
attempts
to
make
available
to
the
smaller
investors,
the
same
kind
of
investment
service,
it
is
hitherto
provided
for
the
larger
investments,
congress
must
to
prevented
this
in
the
glass-steagall
act.
it
is
already
been
referenced
to
the
fact
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there’s
obviously
a
difference
mr.
justice,
but
i’m
addressing
myself
in
terms
of
the
evils
to
which
glass-steagall
was
directed.
the
possibility
of
conflicting
interest,
the
possibility
of
misuse
by
the
bank
of
the
capital
that
it
has
received
in
a
fiduciary
capacity,
the
misuse
it
could
make
because
of
its
investment
facilities.
what
i’m
arguing
is
that
that
misuse
is
no
less
present
in
the
case
of
a
$200,000.00
fund
than
in
the
case
of
20
$10,000.00
or
indeed
i
may
take
it
one
step
beyond
this,
the
banks
for
at
least
15
years
have
been
permitted
to
commingle
pension
trust.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
to
commingle
pension
trust.
they
can
take
several
pension
trusts
and
put
them
into
one
pool
of
capital.
the
amount
of
money
i
understand
today
in
pension
trust
and
employee
profit
sharing
plans
runs
into
the
billions,
much
more
than
the
amount
that’s
even
talked
of
as
likely
to
result
in
this
bank
investment
accounts.
and
again,
if
the
bank
is
likely
to
be
up
to
mischief,
one
would
have
thought
this
would
have
provided
a
fertile
field.
the
letter
that
is
quoted
by
judge
bazelon
that
mr.
cox
has
set
forth
in
his
appendix
from
chairman
martin
of
the
federal
reserve
board
states
that
their
experience
has
been
that
the
banks
have
not
done
this
kind
of
thing.
then,
we
have
the
other
example
which
has
been
discussed
the
so-called
common
trust
funds.
once
again,
a
small
trust,
it’s
not
feasible
for
the
bank
to
give
the
kind
of
management
to
provide
the
kind
of
service
on
that
smaller
basis.
this
bank
has
told
us
it
can’t
provide
individual
investment
service
for
less
than
$200,000.00,
so
they’re
have
been
permitted
now
for
many
years
to
commingle
with
common
trust
funds
into
a
pool
which
to
all
intents
and
purposes
and
in
terms
of
its
affect
and
in
terms
of
the
possibilities
for
misdoing
is
the
same
is
this
pool
here.
now,
there’s
a
further
affirmative
factor
on
this
phase
of
the
case,
and
that
is
that
this
type
of
thing,
this
making
available
to
the
small
investor
a
type
of
investment
service
that
is
not
hitherto
been
available,
makes
available
to
these
people
a
new
opportunity
to
invest
their
money
to
get
the
kind
of
service
for
the
small
investors
that
hitherto
was
only
been
available
for
the
large.
it
is
true,
it
is
true
that
there
are
so-called
no
load
mutual
funds
which
the
man
does
not
have
to
pay
to
get
in,
but
these
are
the
minority.
i
think
the
briefs
indicate
that
95%
of
all
investment
companies
of
the
so-called
load
funds
where
the
man
has
to
pay
a
commission
of
7%
or
8%
to
get
into
it.
now,
there
are
many
small
investors
who
may
feel
that
they
prefer
the
stability,
the
reliability,
the
conservatism
that
is
traditionally
associated
with
banks,
and
i
would
think
they
would
welcome
the
opportunity
to
have
this
service
made
available
to
them
and
this
is
basically
what
the
bank
service
is
doing
here.
it’s
making
available
to
the
small
investor
the
kind
of
investment
advice
that
he
is
not
hitherto
had
it’s
doing
it
under
a
--
it’s
fiduciary
powers
and
it
seems
to
us,
there’s
a
strong
public
interest
in
making
this
competing
form
of
investment
by
its
service
available.
