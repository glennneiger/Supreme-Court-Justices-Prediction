mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
in
this
case
has
to
do
with
section
2
first
of
the
railway
labor
act,
the
provision
that
says
that
“it
shall
be
the
duty
of
parties
to
a
railway
labor
dispute
to
exert
every
reasonable
effort
to
dispose
of
their
differences.”
more
precisely,
the
question
is
whether
if
a
union
violates
section
2
first,
may
the
company
secure
a
strike
injunction
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
all
of
the
other
formal
procedural
requirements
of
the
act
had
been
met.
that
is
to
say
that
conferences
had
been
held
and
that
mediation
has
been
had
and
the
board
has
terminated
jurisdiction
and
either
an
emergency
board
has
or
hasn’t
been
appointed,
but
in
any
case,
the
relevant
cooling
off
period
has
run.
now,
i
think
that
i
can
summarize
very
briefly
the
factual
events
that
led
to
the
presentation
of
this
issue
here.
the
dispute
between
the
parties
has
to
do
with
the
number
of
brakemen
that
should
be
employed
upon
the
trains
of
the
northwestern.
this
is
a
part
or
an
aspect
of
a
much
broader
long-standing
controversy
between
the
railroads
and
the
unions
with
respect
to
a
wide
range
of
work
rules
that
the
railroads
have
maintained
are
unduly
burdensome
anachronisms.
i
suppose
the
most
prominent
example
of
this
sort
of
a
problem
has
to
do
with
use
of
firemen
on
diesel
locomotives.
now,
with
respect
to
the
brakemen
problem,
the
carriers
of
the
country
secured
very
substantial
relief
in
the
mid-1960’s
by
virtue
of
a
compulsory
arbitration
statute
that
was
enacted
by
the
congress
in
late
1963
and
pursuant
to
that
legislation,
arbitration
board
sat
across
the
country
and
the
consequence
was
that
the
carriers
were
authorized
to
eliminate
thousands
and
thousands
of
brakemen
positions
or
however
subject
to
the
obligation
to
protect
the
existing
employees.
on
the
northwestern,
the
authorization
for
elimination
went
to
something
in
the
way
of
200
crews
which
represented
a
potential
saving
of
something
in
the
way
of
$2
million
a
year,
but
these
awards
expired
in
january
of
1966
and
so
in
june
and
july
of
1965
the
union
began
its
efforts
to
recapture
its
position
by
serving
upon
some
80
odd
railroads
section
6
proposals
which
would
have
restored
all
of
the
eliminated
positions.
and
the
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
it
was
by
the
terms
of
the
award
mr.
justice
blackmun
as
required
by
the
statute.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
well,
the
hope
of
the
congress
i
take
it
was
that
during
this
2-year
period,
as
some
of
the
courts
have
indicated
who
have
reviewed
this
matter,
that
a
new
plateau
of
work
rules
and
manning
regulations
would
be
achieved
to
collect
the
bargain.
and
the
alternative
of
course
was
to
make
the
solution
a
permanent
one
and
the
congress
group
act
from
that
and
the
hope
that
the
parties
would
workout
their
own
differences
during
this
period,
but
unhappily
that
hope
has
not
matured.
and
what
happened
then
of
the
expiration
of
the
awards
was
that
the
union
in
pursuit
of
these
section
6
notices
insisted
upon
carrier
by
carrier
negotiation
which
put
them
in
the
position
to
call
whipsaw
strikes
against
individual
railroads
and
the
consequence
of
all
that
was
a
series
of
strikes
and
threats
of
strikes
in
1968
and
1969
and
the
consequence
of
that
was
the
surrender
by
most
of
the
nation's
railroads
of
practically
all
the
benefits
that
they
had
secured
under
this
arbitration
awards.
the
union
got
to
the
northwestern
rather
late
in
this
series
of
mediations
but
in
any
case
conferences
were
had,
mediation
was
held
and
the
board
terminated
its
jurisdiction
over
the
case
in
october
of
1969,
october
16th
by
the
way,
so
that
the
30-day
cooling
off
period
ran
on
november
16th
of
1969.
and
three
days
later
the
northwestern
brought
this
suit
alleging
that
though
conferences
had
been
had
and
mediation
had
been
held,
that
they
were
not
the
sort
of
conferences
and
it
was
not
the
sort
of
mediation
contemplated
by
the
act
because
the
union
which
was
charged
had
not
fulfilled
its
obligations
in
terms
of
bargaining
that
were
imposed
upon
it
by
section
2
first.
the
district
court
granted
a
restraining
order.
a
hearing
was
had
on
the
most
of
the
preliminary
injunction,
but
at
the
conclusion
of
the
northwestern’s
evidence,
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint
without
reaching
the
merits
of
the
allegations
on
the
ground
that
section
2
first
of
the
act
is
not
enforceable
by
the
courts,
but
only
by
the
national
mediation
board.
the
district
court
did
grant
an
injunction
pending
appeal.
after
an
expedited
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
on
the
same
rationale,
but
recognizing
that
its
decision
was
contrary
to
a
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit
in
the
piedmont
aviation
case,
the
court
of
appeals
stayed
its
mandate
pending
the
outcome
of
these
proceedings
before
this
court.
here,
the
respondent
urges
the
adoption
of
the
rationale
of
the
lower
courts
that
is
that
section
2
first
does
not
impose
judicially
enforceable
obligations.
the
afl
amicus
curiae
on
the
other
hand,
suggests
that
even
if
2
first
is
judicially
enforceable
that
the
mode
of
enforcement
should
not
include
strike
injunctions
because
of
the
prohibitions
of
norris-laguardia.
i
want
of
course
to
touch
upon
both
strands
of
these
arguments
but
before
i
do
that,
i
should
like
to
indicate
to
the
court
the
range
of
different
kinds
of
problems
that
have
been
dealt
with
by
the
courts
under
section
2
first,
because
it
is
our
view
that
if
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
is
affirmed
there
will
be
a
very
dislocating
effect
with
respect
to
a
substantial
and
important
body
of
case
law
that
has
been
built
up
on
the
premise
of
section
2
first
is
enforceable.
of
course,
one
kind
of
case
is
the
one
that
was
alleged
in
the
court
below
in
here
that
i
won’t
go
to
the
evidence
because
the
lower
courts
never
reached
it.
but
the
character
of
the
allegations
go
to
what
has
been
called
subjective
bad
faith
bargaining,
at
least,
many
of
the
allegations
go
to
that
so
that
this
is
the
kind
of
the
case
in
which
it's
charged
that
the
union
came
to
the
bargaining
table
with
a
predetermined
position
and
a
determination
not
to
deviate
from
that
position
no
matter
what
relevant
considerations
might
be
advanced
for
the
carrier.
it
was
in
the
terms
of
art
that
are
sometimes
used
in
this
area,
a
surface
bargaining,
take
it
or
leave
it
bargaining
and
the
only
option
given
to
the
carrier
was
to
concede
or
to
take
a
strike.
now,
i
should
like
to
indicate
that
2
first
is
a
two-way
street
with
respect
to
this
kind
of
charge
as
the
pending
litigation
brought
by
the
united
states
against
the
florida
east
coast
railway
indicates.
we’ve
described
that
litigation
in
our
supplemental
reply
brief,
but
there
the
government
joined
by
the
unions
is
asserting
that
the
railroad
of
florida
east
coast
should
not
be
permitted
to
put
into
effect
its
sweeping
section
6
proposals
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
it
has
exhausted
all
of
the
formal
procedures
of
the
act
on
the
ground
as
the
government
charges
that
the
railroad
has
not
complied
with
its
bargaining
obligations
under
section
2
first.
now,
there’s
another
kind
of
a
problem
that
the
courts
have
dealt
with
under
2
first
and
that
has
to
do
with
the
bargaining
authority
of
the
collective
bargaining
representatives.
in
the
case
at
bar
for
example,
the
evidence
showed
that
the
union
representatives
refused
even
to
discuss
a
compromise
proposal
by
the
railroad
that
would
have
involved
the
payment
of
very
substantial
additional
compensation
to
the
existing
employees,
something
in
the
way
of
an
extra
thousand
dollars
a
year.
and
it
showed
also
that
the
reason,
of
course
this
is
only
carrier’s
evidence,
the
union
hasn't
had
a
chance
to
put
a
case
in,
but
by
the
carrier’s
evidence,
it
showed
that
the
reason
that
the
agents,
the
collective
bargaining
representatives
refused
even
to
discuss
this
proposal
is
because
a
convention
resolution
tied
their
hands
and
this
kind
of
a
restriction
upon
the
authority
of
bargaining
representatives
has
been
held
by
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
piedmont
aviation
to
contravene
section
2
first.
in
addition,
the
enforceability
of
moratorium
clauses
has
been
dealt
with
in
the
lower
courts
under
section
2
first.
moratorium
clauses
are
coming
into
more
widespread
use
in
this
industry.
the
hope
of
course
is
that
in
this
industry
as
has
been
true
on
others,
disputes
can
be
settled
and
then
there
can
be
for
a
substantial
period
of
time
some
reasonable
tranquility,
but
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice?
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
there
is
no
split
to
my
knowledge
except
the
split
that
was
opened
by
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
in
this
case.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes.
i
think
we’ve
cited
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
prior
to
that
decision,
we’ve
cited
something
in
the
way
of
30-40
lower
court
of
decisions
in
our
brief
including
decisions
of
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
that
sustained
the
enforceability
of
2
first.
in
the
moratorium
area,
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
leading
decision
is
one
written
by
judge
friendly
for
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
quite
recently
in
the
seaboard
world
airlines
case.
the
problem
here
arises
when
the
union
concedes
that
if
section
6
notices
is
within
the
terms
of
the
moratorium
so
that
there’s
no
question
for
the
adjustment
board,
but
it
asserts
that
the
moratorium
clause
is
not
valid
either
because
it’s
hostile
to
the
purposes
of
the
railway
labor
act
or
for
some
other
contract
reason
and
the
lower
courts
have
considered
and
decided
those
cases
and
enforced
the
moratorium
caused
by
strike
injunction.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
well,
they’re
of
different
types,
but
basically,
the
moratorium
clause
would
bar
the
unions
and
the
carriers
from
serving
section
6
notices
covering
prescribed
subjects.
generally
speaking,
the
subjects
that
result
in
that
particular
contract
for
a
particular
period
of
time
and
they
may
be
accompanied,
although
i
don’t
think
it's
necessary
that
they
be
accompanied,
but
they
may
be
accompanied
by
an
no
strike
clause,
as
boys
market
kind
of
a
case
that
the
court
had
last
year
and
indeed,
the
seaboard
world
airlines
case
did
involve
a
moratorium
clause
with
a
no
strike
provision
and
as
i
say,
the
courts
enforced
those
clauses
by
virtue
of
the
obligation
of
section
2
first
upon
the
parties
not
only
to
make
but
also
to
maintain
agreements.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
that’s
right.
we’ve
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
--
settled
in
this
contract
wages,
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
--
health
and
welfare
and
whatever
else
it
is
that
we’ve
settled
and
we’ve
settled
and
we
promised
not
to
reopen
for
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
right.
usually,
not
quite
that
long.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
then
also
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
every
reasonable
effort.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
some
are
--
i
think
the
bulk
of
the
cases
probably
are
directed
to
the
kind
of
problems
that
i’m
talking
about
now.
the
making
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
oh
no,
i
don’t
think
there
are
many
flat
refusals
to
bargain.
the
question
is
always
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
not
since
virginian
and
i
think
that’s
right,
right.
now,
there
could
be
a
situation
of
a
flat
refusal
of
the
bargain
on
the
basis
of
the
position
of
law
that
the
moratorium
clause
does
or
doesn’t
bar
the
proposal
and
then
that
kind
of
case
will
arise.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
no.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don’t
myself.
i
think
that
the
--
i
read
section
2
first
as
to
somewhat
broader
provision
than
the
good
faith
bargaining
clause
in
the
lmra
and
i
suggest
that
the
kinds
of
cases
i’m
describing
now
indicate
that
it
is.
the
enforceability
of
a
moratorium
clause
may
fall
under
section
301
jurisdiction
of
the
lmra
but
on
the
railway
labor
act
there’s
no
equivalence
and
so
it’s
put
under
section
2
first.
now,
i
think
in
one,
in
the
chicago
rock
island
case,
judge
friendly
observed
that
section
2
first
was
written
in
somewhat
broader
language
and
it
might
well
have
a
broader
scope.
for
example,
the
lower
courts
have
also
decided
whether
the
bargaining
unit
should
be
a
multi-employer
unit
in
a
particular
controversy
or
a
single
employer
unit
in
a
single
controversy
depending
upon
which
of
those
methods
of
negotiations
seem
to
give
the
greater
promise
of
a
piece
of
a
resolution
of
the
problem
and
they’ve
decided
that
under
section
2
first
and
i
think
there’s
no
equivalent
kind
of
decision
under
the
lmra
good
faith
bargaining
clause,
so
that
the
lines
of
cases
that
i'm
talking
about
may
fall
some
place
else
under
lmra,
but
i
don’t
think
they
fall
in
to
the
good
faith
bargaining
provision
of
the
lmra.
and
i
finally,
i
should
mention
the
role
that
section
2
first
plays
in
the
status
quo
provisions
of
the
act.
now,
in
jacksonville
terminal
and
in
last
year
in
detroit
and
toledo
shoreline,
this
court
indicated
that
the
structure
of
the
act
contemplated
that
both
parties
maintain
the
status
quo
during
the
exhaustion
of
all
of
the
major
disputes
procedures
of
the
act
and
there’s
no
difficulty
here,
if
one
looks
at
the
status
quo
provisions
that
come
into
play
when
the
mediation
board
terminates
its
services
because
sections
5
and
10
clearly
applied
to
both
parties.
but
there
is
a
difficulty,
a
textual
difficulty
with
respect
to
section
6
which
governs
the
relations
of
the
parties
during
this
whole
period
of
conferences
and
mediation
because
section
6
in
terms
applies
only
to
the
carriers.
now,
it’s
plain
to
me
that
the
court
discerned
that
difficulty
in
writing
the
shoreline
case
because
after
describing
these
various
status
quo
provisions
in
6,
5
and
10
the
court
concluded
by
saying
this.
“these
provisions
must
be
read
in
connection
with
the
implicit
status
quo
requirement
in
the
obligation
imposed
upon
both
parties
by
section
2
first.”
now,
the
point
that
i
want
to
make
is
that
where
such
an
important
and
variegated
structure
of
case
law
has
been
built
in
this
area
upon
the
premise
of
section
2
first
is
enforceable
and
enforceable
by
strike
injunction
because
every
case
that
i’ve
talked
about
is
strike
injunction
case.
the
respondent
i
respectfully
submit
has
a
heavy
burden
to
meet
in
showing
that
indeed
section
2
first
is
not
enforceable.
now,
let
me
briefly
talk
about
the
arguments
made
on
both
sides.
i’d
like
to
discuss
the
question
of
justiciability
first
putting
aside
for
the
moment
the
norris-laguardia
matter.
we
say
in
the
first
place
that
the
language
of
the
statutes
strongly
supports
us.
it
says
that
it
shall
be
the
duty
of
the
parties
to
comply
with
2
first.
secondly,
we
say
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
supports
us
again
quite
strongly.
we’ve
discussed
it
in
some
detail
on
pages
35
to
38
of
our
brief
and
of
course
i
don’t
have
time
to
review
it
in
detail
here
but
by
way
of
illustration
let
me
simply
say
that
mr.
richburg
who
discussed
this
matter
for
the
unions
in
the
hearings
at
some
considerable
length
to
summarize
this
position
by
saying
this
about
section
2
first.
the
legal
obligation
is
imposed
and
as
i
have
previously
stated
and
i
want
to
emphasize
it,
i
believe
that
the
deliberate
violation
of
that
legal
obligation
could
be
prevented
by
court
compulsion,
there
is
nothing
to
the
contrary
in
legislative
history
of
this
provision.
now,
third
and
i
suppose
really
first
in
order
of
importance,
this
court
in
virginian
railway
held
that
section
2
first
is
enforceable
by
the
courts.
there,
this
court
enforced
an
injunction
or
affirmed
the
validity
of
an
injunction
against
the
carrier
which
not
only
bounded
to
treat
with
the
employees
within
the
meaning
of
section
2
nine,
but
also
to
exercise,
exert
every
reasonable
effort
to
settle
their
disputes
within
under
section
2
first
and
it
was
argued
to
this
court
that
section
2
first
is
not
justiciable
and
this
court
rejected
that
contention.
i
think
the
key
paragraph
perhaps
in
the
opinion
is
one
of
those
quoted
on
page
50
of
our
brief,
i’ll
just
read
one
sentence
of
it.
it,
that
is
the
statute,
at
least
requires
the
employer
to
meet
and
confer
with
the
authorized
representative
of
its
employees
to
listen
to
their
complaints,
to
make
reasonable
effort
to
compose
differences,
in
short,
to
enter
into
a
negotiation
for
the
settlement
of
labor
disputes
such
as
is
contemplated
by
section
2
first
and
every
subsequent
expression
of
opinion
by
this
court
about
section
2
first
in
virginian
is
thoroughly
in
accord.
we’ve
quoted
all
of
the
relevant
passages
from
a
number
of
this
court’s
opinions
beginning
on
page
52
of
our
brief.
let
me
just
read
one
from
the
leading
opinion
in
elgin,
joliet
and
eastern
versus
burley.
this
is
what
the
court
said
there.
“thus,
one
of
the
statute's
primary
commands
judicially
enforceable
is
found
in
the
repeated
declaration
of
a
duty
upon
all
parties
to
a
dispute
to
negotiate
for
its
settlement.
this
duty
is
not
barely
perfunctory.
good
faith
exhaustion
of
a
possibility
of
agreement
is
required
to
fulfill
it,”
citing
virginian
in
section
2
among
other
provisions.
now,
the
respondent
on
the
lower
court
rely
upon
m-k-t,
but
in
m-k-t
this
court
simply
held
that
section
2
ninth
of
the
act
was
design
specifically
to
cover
representational
disputes
and
that
provision
withdrew
those
disputes
from
the
court
and
it
simply
said
with
respect
to
2
first
and
2
second
that
this
more
generally
phrased
provisions
could
not
detract
from
that
more
specific
intent
going
to
that
kind
of
dispute,
but
we
don’t
have
a
representational
dispute
here
and
this
court
has
never
said
anything
that
in
any
way
intimates
that
it
ever
intended
to
cut
into
virginian.
just
a
word
or
two
about
the
mediation
board,
the
lower
courts
thought
that
the
mediation
board
had
authority
to
enforce
section
2
first.
in
the
first
place,
the
statute
doesn’t
say
that.
this
court
in
detroit
and
toledo
shoreline
last
year
in
rejecting
a
long
standing
interpretation
of
the
board
of
the
act
said
that
the
board
has
no
adjudicatory
responsibility
in
major
disputes.
secondly,
the
legislative
history
again
which
we
set
forth
in
detail
in
our
brief
shows
that
the
congress
or
that
the
frameworks
of
the
act
rather
where
anxious
to
withdraw
any
adjudicatory
authority
from
the
board
so
as
to
preserve
its
neutrality,
its
ability
to
conciliate.
next,
the
board
has
never
as
a
matter
of
practice
enforced
2
first,
as
the
materials
that
we
set
forth
in
our
brief
establish
i
think.
and
then
finally,
i
think
that
it
ought
to
be
noted
that
the
mediation
board
would
be
powerless
to
enforce
section
2
first
in
bearing
in
a
very
great
many
cases
because
once
the
board
releases
its
jurisdiction
then
it's
out
of
the
picture
for
the
30-day
cooling
off
period
after
that
and
for
the
next
60
days
associated
with
the
hearings,
proceedings
of
an
emergency
board.
and
so
it’s
for
these
reasons
that
we
urged
that
section
2
first
is
judicially
enforceable
by
the
courts
and
not
by
the
board.
now,
as
to
norris-laguardia.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes
mr.
justice
white?
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
i
think
they
have
to
terminate
mr.
justice
white,
that’s
what
the
statute
to
me
says.
it
says
that
when
the
board
has
exhausted
it
efforts
to
bring
the
parties
to
an
agreement
and
it
can’t
do
it,
that
it’s
supposed
to
release
the
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
understand
that
in
the
florida
east
coast
case
where
the
government
is
now
urging
that
the
florida
east
coast
violated
section
2
first
by
not
bargaining,
the
florida
east
coast
sued
the
mediation
board
to
get
them
to
release
the
case
and
the
mediation
board
released
the
case
before
that
case
can
come.
and
i
think
the
mediation
board
is
obliged
to
release
it
after
a
reasonable
period
of
time
and
i
think
they
do
that,
i
think
they
do
that.
i
don’t
think
that
the
government
would
be
taking
the
position
in
florida
east
coast
that
the
railroad
had
violated
2
first,
if
it
had
also
thought
that
the
mediation
board
had
violated
its
responsibilities
by
releasing
that
case.
now,
as
to
norris-laguardia,
our
position,
put
as
simply
as
i
can
is
that
based
on
this
court’s
prior
decisions
and
the
legislative
history
of
norris-laguardia,
norris-laguardia
simply
does
not
apply
to
a
case
in
which
the
claim
is
that
there
has
been
a
violation
of
an
important
provision
of
the
railway
labor
act.
we
think
that’s
what
graham
and
steele
and
tunstall
and
virginian
and
chicago
river
say.
in
chicago
river
for
example
the
court
said
and
that
of
course
was
strike
injunction
suit,
said
that
this
court
is
authorized
the
use
of
injunctive
relief
to
vindicate
the
processes
of
the
railway
labor
act
and
has
held
that
the
specific
provisions
of
the
railway
labor
act
take
precedents
over
the
more
general
provisions
of
the
norris-laguardia.
that
principle
is
thoroughly
rooted
in
the
legislative
history
of
norris-laguardia
which
is
discussed
in
some
detail
in
our
reply
brief.
congressman
la
guardia
spoke
to
the
problem
and
he
said
quite
plainly
that
norris-laguardia
was
not
intended
to
touch
the
railway
labor
act.
and
the
lower
courts
in
a
consistent
and
long
line
of
decisions
since
chicago
river
have
applied
or
have
declined
to
apply
norris-laguardia
in
both
major
and
minor
disputes
where
the
claim
was
a
violation
of
one
of
the
significant
provisions
of
the
act.
now
the
amicus
suggests
that
an
exception
should
be
made
with
respect
to
section
2
first.
we’ve
discussed
the
various
policy
considerations
that
the
amicus
advances
on
our
reply
brief
and
i
don’t
have
time
to
deal
with
them
now
but
i
would
like
to
make
one
point
because
i
think
central
to
the
amicus’
analysis
is
the
suggestion
that
there’s
an
alternative
way
of
securing
the
interest
protected
by
section
2
first
and
that
is
by
getting
an
injunction
early
in
the
game
compelling
good
faith
bargaining
so
that
an
agreement
might
mature
before
a
strike.
now,
we
suggest
that
is
not
a
practical
remedy
because
it
would
require
a
bad
faith
bargaining
suit
to
be
instituted
right
in
the
middle
of
negotiations
in
the
earlier
middle
stages
and
to
institute
that
kind
of
litigation
we
think
would
be
destructive
of
collective
bargaining.
indeed,
we
think
that’s
what
this
court
said
in
substance
last
year
in
boyce
river
(ph)
in
discussing
the
availability
of
a
damage
remedy
and
there
the
court
said
that
the
institution
of
that
kind
of
litigation
would
be
damaging
to
the
relationships
between
the
parties.
now,
besides
that
and
equally
important,
we’re
dealing
here
with
the
statute
in
which
the
negotiating
periods
are
long
and
protracted
and
if
the
carrier
would
have
come
into
court
in
the
earlier
or
middle
stages
of
that
--
of
those
periods,
the
union
would
always
be
able
to
say
“well,
now
look
at
it,
there’s
a
long
road
ahead
of
us”
and
positions
inevitably
change
and
it
is
simply
too
early
to
make
a
determination
that
we’re
not
bargaining
in
good
faith
and
that
is
precisely
what
the
courts
have
said,
what
the
court
had
said
in
the
only
case
that
we’ve
been
able
to
discover
in
which
that
kind
of
relief
was
sought.
the
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
georgia
in
an
opinion
affirmed
by
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
adapted
by
that
court
said
in
substance
you’re
here
too
early,
this
suit
is
premature.
this
position
of
the
union
may
topple
of
its
own
weight
in
the
course
of
the
further
negotiations
and
discussions
that
were
required
by
the
act
so
that
it
is
only
at
the
terminal
stages
when
a
threat
of
strike
of
real
damage
is
imminent
that
the
courts
we
feel
will
entertain
a
suit
to
enforce
section
2
first.
i’d
like
if
i
have
any
time
left
i’d
like
to
reserve
it
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
haley
has
laid
such
a
stress
upon
the
role
of
the
mediation
board
that
i
thought
perhaps
it
might
be
useful
to
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
relevant
statutory
provision
here
which
is
section
5
first
of
the
act.
it’s
the
only
section
in
the
act
that
goes
to
the
duties
of
the
mediation
board,
it
says
this.
“that
the
said
board
shall
promptly
put
itself
in
communication
with
the
parties
to
such
controversy
and
shall
use
its
best
efforts
by
mediation
to
bring
them
to
agreement.
if
such
efforts
to
bring
about
an
amicable
settlement
through
mediation
shall
be
unsuccessful,
the
said
board
shall
at
once
endeavor
as
its
final
required
action
to
induce
the
parties
to
submit
their
controversy
to
arbitration.
if
arbitration
offer
is
refused,
the
board
shall
at
once
notify
both
parties
in
writing
that
its
mediatory
efforts
have
failed
and
then
the
status
quo
shelved
for
30
days.
mr.
haley
is
speaking
of
a
statutory
arrangement
under
which
the
decision
as
to
whether
2
first
that
had
been
complied
with
would
be
committed
by
the
congress
to
an
administrative
agency
and
then
it
would
be
specified
that
there
should
be
no
judicial
review
of
those
determinations.
surely,
the
congress
could
write
such
a
statute,
but
it
is
simply
importing
too
much
in
the
statutory
language
to
conclude
that
that
is
the
system
of
the
congress
here
established.
beyond
that,
the
practice
of
the
board
has
not
been
to
decide
section
2
first
questions.
mr.
haley,
referred
to
a
speech
given
by
mr.
gamser,
the
former
chairman
of
the
board.
it
is
quoted
impertinent
part
in
our
brief
on
page
76
of
footnote
31.
what
mr.
gamser
said
there
was
that
certain
airline
spokesmen
had
suggested
that
the
board
should
not
release
the
case
from
mediation
“if
either
party
has
not
in
the
opinion
of
the
board
made
every
effort
to
resolve
the
dispute,”
but
mr.
gamser
characterized
this
as
“advocating
a
greater
exercise
of
discretion
hereto
employed
by
the
board”
and
the
question
whether
“there
is
statutory
language
to
allow
the
board
to
make
such
a
determination”
and
then
he
went
on
to
discuss
the
procedural
steps
such
as
hearings
and
the
right
to
put
in
evidence
and
that
sort
of
thing
that
the
board
might
have
to
employ.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
with
respect
to
section
2
first,
mr.
justice
blackmun?
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes.
section
2
tenth
provides
for
criminal
penalties
for
violation
of
certain
of
the
subsections
of
section
2,
but
it
does
not
include
section
2
first.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
no,
there
is
not
as
this
court
in
effect
held
in
virginian
because
the
penalty
section
does
not
touch
section
2
ninth
either
and
of
course,
the
court,
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
court
in
virginian
held
2
ninth
enforceable
and
beyond
that
the
court
in
the
texas
&
n.
o.
case
said
that
the
absence
of
judicial
penalty
is
not
determinative
with
respect
to
considering
the
enforceability
of
these
sections,
so
that
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
oh!
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
i’m
just
assuming
to
arguendo
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
to
treat
with.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
section
2
first
says
but
let
me
point
out
again
that
the
injunction
itself
requires,
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
--
used
the
words
treat
with
and
exert
every
reasonable
effort.
now,
i’m
hard
pressed
to
understand
how
virginian
can
be
distinguished
in
any
way.
i
was
simply
making
the
point
with
respect
to
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
question
that
even
if
one
put
section
2
first
aside
that
the
penalty
provisions
don’t
apply
to
2
ninth
either
and
surely
no
one
would
question
that
virginian
enforced
2
ninth,
but
the
way
or
the
effort
to
distinguish
virginian
i
suggest
simply
has
to
fail
but
let
me
put
it
this
way.
if
in
the
wake
of
that
affirmance
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
injunction
in
virginian,
the
railroad
had
failed
to
exert
every
reasonable
effort,
i
submit
that
a
contempt
action
would
lie.
the
court
simply
did
not
exhort
the
parties
in
virginian,
it
affirmed
an
injunction
which
is
presumably
binding
on
the
parties.
thank
you.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
in
this
case
has
to
do
with
section
2
first
of
the
railway
labor
act,
the
provision
that
says
that
“it
shall
be
the
duty
of
parties
to
a
railway
labor
dispute
to
exert
every
reasonable
effort
to
dispose
of
their
differences.”
more
precisely,
the
question
is
whether
if
a
union
violates
section
2
first,
may
the
company
secure
a
strike
injunction
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
all
of
the
other
formal
procedural
requirements
of
the
act
had
been
met.
that
is
to
say
that
conferences
had
been
held
and
that
mediation
has
been
had
and
the
board
has
terminated
jurisdiction
and
either
an
emergency
board
has
or
hasn’t
been
appointed,
but
in
any
case,
the
relevant
cooling
off
period
has
run.
now,
i
think
that
i
can
summarize
very
briefly
the
factual
events
that
led
to
the
presentation
of
this
issue
here.
the
dispute
between
the
parties
has
to
do
with
the
number
of
brakemen
that
should
be
employed
upon
the
trains
of
the
northwestern.
this
is
a
part
or
an
aspect
of
a
much
broader
long-standing
controversy
between
the
railroads
and
the
unions
with
respect
to
a
wide
range
of
work
rules
that
the
railroads
have
maintained
are
unduly
burdensome
anachronisms.
i
suppose
the
most
prominent
example
of
this
sort
of
a
problem
has
to
do
with
use
of
firemen
on
diesel
locomotives.
now,
with
respect
to
the
brakemen
problem,
the
carriers
of
the
country
secured
very
substantial
relief
in
the
mid-1960’s
by
virtue
of
a
compulsory
arbitration
statute
that
was
enacted
by
the
congress
in
late
1963
and
pursuant
to
that
legislation,
arbitration
board
sat
across
the
country
and
the
consequence
was
that
the
carriers
were
authorized
to
eliminate
thousands
and
thousands
of
brakemen
positions
or
however
subject
to
the
obligation
to
protect
the
existing
employees.
on
the
northwestern,
the
authorization
for
elimination
went

of
200
crews
which
represented
a
potential
saving
of
something
in
the
way
of
$2
million
a
year,
but
these
awards
expired
in
january
of
1966
and
so
in
june
and
july
of
1965
the
union
began
its
efforts
to
recapture
its
position
by
serving
upon
some
80
odd
railroads
section
6
proposals
which
would
have
restored
all
of
the
eliminated
positions.

the

mr.
william

well,
the
hope
of
the
congress
i
take
it
was
that
during
this
2-year
period,
as
some
of
the
courts
have
indicated
who
have
reviewed
this
matter,
that
a
new
plateau
of
work
rules
and
manning
regulations
would
be
achieved
to
collect
the
bargain.
and
the
alternative
of
course
was
to
make
the
solution
a
permanent
one
and
the
congress
group
act
from
that
and
the
hope
that
the
parties
would
workout
their
own
differences
during
this
period,
but
unhappily
that
hope
has
not
matured.
and
what
happened
then
of
the
expiration
of
the
awards
was
that
the
union
in
pursuit
of
these
section
6
notices
insisted
upon
carrier
by
carrier
negotiation
which
put
them
in
the
position
to
call
whipsaw
strikes
against
individual
railroads
and
the
consequence
of
all
that
was
a
series
of
strikes
and
threats
of
strikes
in
1968
and
1969
and
the
consequence
of
that
was
the
surrender
by
most
of
the
nation's
railroads
of
practically
all
the
benefits
that
they
had
secured
under
this
arbitration
awards.
the
union
got
to
the
northwestern
rather
late
in
this
series
of
mediations
but
in
any
case
conferences
were
had,
mediation
was
held
and
the
board
terminated
its
jurisdiction
over
the
case
in
october
of
1969,
october
16th
by
the
way,
so
that
the
30-day
cooling
off
period
ran
on
november
16th
of
1969.
and
three
days
later
the
northwestern
brought
this
suit
alleging
that
though
conferences
had
been
had
and
mediation
had
been
held,
that
they
were
not
the
sort
of
conferences
and
it
was
not
the
sort
of
mediation
contemplated
by
the
act
because
the
union
which
was
charged
had
not
fulfilled
its
obligations
in
terms
of
bargaining
that
were
imposed
upon
it
by
section
2
first.
the
district
court
granted
a
restraining
order.
a
hearing
was
had
on
the
most
of
the
preliminary
injunction,
but
at
the
conclusion
of
the
northwestern’s
evidence,
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint
without
reaching
the
merits
of
the
allegations
on
the
ground
that
section
2
first
of
the
act
is
not
enforceable
by
the
courts,
but
only
by
the
national
mediation
board.
the
district
court
did
grant
an
injunction
pending
appeal.
after
an
expedited
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
on
the
same
rationale,
but
recognizing
that
its
decision
was
contrary
to
a
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit
in
the
piedmont
aviation
case,
the
court
of
appeals
stayed
its
mandate
pending
the
outcome
of
these
proceedings
before
this
court.
here,
the
respondent
urges
the
adoption
of
the
rationale
of
the
lower
courts
that
is
that
section
2
first
does
not
impose
judicially
enforceable
obligations.
the
afl
amicus
curiae
on
the
other
hand,
suggests
that
even
if
2
first
is
judicially
enforceable
that
the
mode
of
enforcement
should
not
include
strike
injunctions
because
of
the
prohibitions
of
norris-laguardia.
i
want
of
course
to
touch
upon
both
strands
of
these
arguments
but
before
i
do
that,
i
should
like
to
indicate
to
the
court
the
range
of
different
kinds
of
problems
that
have
been
dealt
with
by
the
courts
under
section
2
first,
because
it
is
our
view
that
if
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
is
affirmed
there
will
be
a
very
dislocating
effect
with
respect
to
a
substantial
and
important
body
of
case
law
that
has
been
built
up
on
the
premise
of
section
2
first
is
enforceable.
of
course,
one
kind
of
case
is
the
one
that
was
alleged
in
the
court
below
in
here
that
i
won’t
go
to
the
evidence
because
the
lower
courts
never
reached
it.
but
the
character
of
the
allegations
go
to
what
has
been
called
subjective
bad
faith
bargaining,
at
least,
many
of
the
allegations
go
to
that
so
that
this
is
the
kind
of
the
case
in
which
it's
charged
that
the
union
came
to
the
bargaining
table
with
a
predetermined
position
and
a
determination
not
to
deviate
from
that
position
no
matter
what
relevant
considerations
might
be
advanced
for
the
carrier.
it
was
in
the
terms
of
art
that
are
sometimes
used
in
this
area,
a
surface
bargaining,
take
it
or
leave
it
bargaining
and
the
only
option
given
to
the
carrier
was
to
concede
or
to
take
a
strike.
now,
i
should
like
to
indicate
that
2
first
is
a
two-way
street
with
respect
to
this
kind
of
charge
as
the
pending
litigation
brought
by
the
united
states
against
the
florida
east
coast
railway
indicates.
we’ve
described
that
litigation
in
our
supplemental
reply
brief,
but
there
the
government
joined
by
the
unions
is
asserting
that
the
railroad
of
florida
east
coast
should
not
be
permitted
to
put
into
effect
its
sweeping
section
6
proposals
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
it
has
exhausted
all
of
the
formal
procedures
of
the
act
on
the
ground
as
the
government
charges
that
the
railroad
has
not
complied
with
its
bargaining
obligations
under
section
2
first.
now,
there’s
another
kind
of
a
problem
that
the
courts
have
dealt
with
under
2
first
and
that
has
to
do
with
the
bargaining
authority
of
the
collective
bargaining
representatives.
in
the
case
at
bar
for
example,
the
evidence
showed
that
the
union
representatives
refused
even
to
discuss
a
compromise
proposal
by
the
railroad
that
would
have
involved
the
payment
of
very
substantial
additional
compensation
to
the
existing
employees,
something
in
the
way
of
an
extra
thousand
dollars
a
year.
and
it
showed
also
that
the
reason,
of
course
this
is
only
carrier’s
evidence,
the
union
hasn't
had
a
chance
to
put
a
case
in,
but
by
the
carrier’s
evidence,
it
showed
that
the
reason
that
the
agents,
the
collective
bargaining
representatives
refused
even
to
discuss
this
proposal
is
because
a
convention
resolution
tied
their
hands
and
this
kind
of
a
restriction
upon
the
authority
of
bargaining
representatives
has
been
held
by
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
piedmont
aviation
to
contravene
section
2
first.
in
addition,
the
enforceability
of
moratorium
clauses
has
been
dealt
with
in
the
lower
courts
under
section
2
first.
moratorium
clauses
are
coming
into
more
widespread
use
in
this
industry.
the
hope
of
course
is
that
in
this
industry
as
has
been
true
on
others,
disputes
can
be
settled
and
then
there
can
be
for
a
substantial
period
of
time
some
reasonable
tranquility,
but
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice?
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
there
is
no
split
to
my
knowledge
except
the
split
that
was
opened
by
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
in
this
case.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes.
i
think
we’ve
cited
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
prior
to
that
decision,
we’ve
cited
something
in
the
way
of
30-40
lower
court
of
decisions
in
our
brief
including
decisions
of
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
that
sustained
the
enforceability
of
2
first.
in
the
moratorium
area,
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
leading
decision
is
one
written
by
judge
friendly
for
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
quite
recently
in
the
seaboard
world
airlines
case.
the
problem
here
arises
when
the
union
concedes
that
if
section
6
notices
is
within
the
terms
of
the
moratorium
so
that
there’s
no
question
for
the
adjustment
board,
but
it
asserts
that
the
moratorium
clause
is
not
valid
either
because
it’s
hostile
to
the
purposes
of
the
railway
labor
act
or
for
some
other
contract
reason
and
the
lower
courts
have
considered
and
decided
those
cases
and
enforced
the
moratorium
caused
by
strike
injunction.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
well,
they’re
of
different
types,
but
basically,
the
moratorium
clause
would
bar
the
unions
and
the
carriers
from
serving
section
6
notices
covering
prescribed
subjects.
generally
speaking,
the
subjects
that
result
in
that
particular
contract
for
a
particular
period
of
time
and
they
may
be
accompanied,
although
i
don’t
think
it's
necessary
that
they
be
accompanied,
but
they
may
be
accompanied
by
an
no
strike
clause,
as
boys
market
kind
of
a
case
that
the
court
had
last
year
and
indeed,
the
seaboard
world
airlines
case
did
involve
a
moratorium
clause
with
a
no
strike
provision
and
as
i
say,
the
courts
enforced
those
clauses
by
virtue
of
the
obligation
of
section
2
first
upon
the
parties
not
only
to
make
but
also
to
maintain
agreements.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
that’s
right.
we’ve
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
--
settled
in
this
contract
wages,
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
--
health
and
welfare
and
whatever
else
it
is
that
we’ve
settled
and
we’ve
settled
and
we
promised
not
to
reopen
for
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
right.
usually,
not
quite
that
long.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
then
also
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
every
reasonable
effort.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
some
are
--
i
think
the
bulk
of
the
cases
probably
are
directed
to
the
kind
of
problems
that
i’m
talking
about
now.
the
making
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
oh
no,
i
don’t
think
there
are
many
flat
refusals
to
bargain.
the
question
is
always
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
not
since
virginian
and
i
think
that’s
right,
right.
now,
there
could
be
a
situation
of
a
flat
refusal
of
the
bargain
on
the
basis
of
the
position
of
law
that
the
moratorium
clause
does
or
doesn’t
bar
the
proposal
and
then
that
kind
of
case
will
arise.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
no.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don’t
myself.
i
think
that
the
--
i
read
section
2
first
as
to
somewhat
broader
provision
than
the
good
faith
bargaining
clause
in
the
lmra
and
i
suggest
that
the
kinds
of
cases
i’m
describing
now
indicate
that
it
is.
the
enforceability
of
a
moratorium
clause
may
fall
under
section
301
jurisdiction
of
the
lmra
but
on
the
railway
labor
act
there’s
no
equivalence
and
so
it’s
put
under
section
2
first.
now,
i
think
in
one,
in
the
chicago
rock
island
case,
judge
friendly
observed
that
section
2
first
was
written
in
somewhat
broader
language
and
it
might
well
have
a
broader
scope.
for
example,
the
lower
courts
have
also
decided
whether
the
bargaining
unit
should
be
a
multi-employer
unit
in
a
particular
controversy
or
a
single
employer
unit
in
a
single
controversy
depending
upon
which
of
those
methods
of
negotiations
seem
to
give
the
greater
promise
of
a
piece
of
a
resolution
of
the
problem
and
they’ve
decided
that
under
section
2
first
and
i
think
there’s
no
equivalent
kind
of
decision
under
the
lmra
good
faith
bargaining
clause,
so
that
the
lines
of
cases
that
i'm
talking
about
may
fall
some
place
else
under
lmra,
but
i
don’t
think
they
fall
in
to
the
good
faith
bargaining
provision
of
the
lmra.
and
i
finally,
i
should
mention
the
role
that
section
2
first
plays
in
the
status
quo
provisions
of
the
act.
now,
in
jacksonville
terminal
and
in
last
year
in
detroit
and
toledo
shoreline,
this
court
indicated
that
the
structure
of
the
act
contemplated
that
both
parties
maintain
the
status
quo
during
the
exhaustion
of
all
of
the
major
disputes
procedures
of
the
act
and
there’s
no
difficulty
here,
if
one
looks
at
the
status
quo
provisions
that
come
into
play
when
the
mediation
board
terminates
its
services
because
sections
5
and
10
clearly
applied
to
both
parties.
but
there
is
a
difficulty,
a
textual
difficulty
with
respect
to
section
6
which
governs
the
relations
of
the
parties
during
this
whole
period
of
conferences
and
mediation
because
section
6
in
terms
applies
only
to
the
carriers.
now,
it’s
plain
to
me
that
the
court
discerned
that
difficulty
in
writing
the
shoreline
case
because
after
describing
these
various
status
quo
provisions
in
6,
5
and
10
the
court
concluded
by
saying
this.
“these
provisions
must
be
read
in
connection
with
the
implicit
status
quo
requirement
in
the
obligation
imposed
upon
both
parties
by
section
2
first.”
now,
the
point
that
i
want
to
make
is
that
where
such
an
important
and
variegated
structure
of
case
law
has
been
built
in
this
area
upon
the
premise
of
section
2
first
is
enforceable
and
enforceable
by
strike
injunction
because
every
case
that
i’ve
talked
about
is
strike
injunction
case.
the
respondent
i
respectfully
submit
has
a
heavy
burden
to
meet
in
showing
that
indeed
section
2
first
is
not
enforceable.
now,
let
me
briefly
talk
about
the
arguments
made
on
both
sides.
i’d
like
to
discuss
the
question
of
justiciability
first
putting
aside
for
the
moment
the
norris-laguardia
matter.
we
say
in
the
first
place
that
the
language
of
the
statutes
strongly
supports
us.
it
says
that
it
shall
be
the
duty
of
the
parties
to
comply
with
2
first.
secondly,
we
say
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
supports
us
again
quite
strongly.
we’ve
discussed
it
in
some
detail
on
pages
35
to
38
of
our
brief
and
of
course
i
don’t
have
time
to
review
it
in
detail
here
but
by
way
of
illustration
let
me
simply
say
that
mr.
richburg
who
discussed
this
matter
for
the
unions
in
the
hearings
at
some
considerable
length
to
summarize
this
position
by
saying
this
about
section
2
first.
the
legal
obligation
is
imposed
and
as
i
have
previously
stated
and
i
want
to
emphasize
it,
i
believe
that
the
deliberate
violation
of
that
legal
obligation
could
be
prevented
by
court
compulsion,
there
is
nothing
to
the
contrary
in
legislative
history
of
this
provision.
now,
third
and
i
suppose
really
first
in
order
of
importance,
this
court
in
virginian
railway
held
that
section
2
first
is
enforceable
by
the
courts.
there,
this
court
enforced
an
injunction
or
affirmed
the
validity
of
an
injunction
against
the
carrier
which
not
only
bounded
to
treat
with
the
employees
within
the
meaning
of
section
2
nine,
but
also
to
exercise,
exert
every
reasonable
effort
to
settle
their
disputes
within
under
section
2
first
and
it
was
argued
to
this
court
that
section
2
first
is
not
justiciable
and
this
court
rejected
that
contention.
i
think
the
key
paragraph
perhaps
in
the
opinion
is
one
of
those
quoted
on
page
50
of
our
brief,
i’ll
just
read
one
sentence
of
it.
it,
that
is
the
statute,
at
least
requires
the
employer
to
meet
and
confer
with
the
authorized
representative
of
its
employees
to
listen
to
their
complaints,
to
make
reasonable
effort
to
compose
differences,
in
short,
to
enter
into
a
negotiation
for
the
settlement
of
labor
disputes
such
as
is
contemplated
by
section
2
first
and
every
subsequent
expression
of
opinion
by
this
court
about
section
2
first
in
virginian
is
thoroughly
in
accord.
we’ve
quoted
all
of
the
relevant
passages
from
a
number
of
this
court’s
opinions
beginning
on
page
52
of
our
brief.
let
me
just
read
one
from
the
leading
opinion
in
elgin,
joliet
and
eastern
versus
burley.
this
is
what
the
court
said
there.
“thus,
one
of
the
statute's
primary
commands
judicially
enforceable
is
found
in
the
repeated
declaration
of
a
duty
upon
all
parties
to
a
dispute
to
negotiate
for
its
settlement.
this
duty
is
not
barely
perfunctory.
good
faith
exhaustion
of
a
possibility
of
agreement
is
required
to
fulfill
it,”
citing
virginian
in
section
2
among
other
provisions.
now,
the
respondent
on
the
lower
court
rely
upon
m-k-t,
but
in
m-k-t
this
court
simply
held
that
section
2
ninth
of
the
act
was
design
specifically
to
cover
representational
disputes
and
that
provision
withdrew
those
disputes
from
the
court
and
it
simply
said
with
respect
to
2
first
and
2
second
that
this
more
generally
phrased
provisions
could
not
detract
from
that
more
specific
intent
going
to
that
kind
of
dispute,
but
we
don’t
have
a
representational
dispute
here
and
this
court
has
never
said
anything
that
in
any
way
intimates
that
it
ever
intended
to
cut
into
virginian.
just
a
word
or
two
about
the
mediation
board,
the
lower
courts
thought
that
the
mediation
board
had
authority
to
enforce
section
2
first.
in
the
first
place,
the
statute
doesn’t
say
that.
this
court
in
detroit
and
toledo
shoreline
last
year
in
rejecting
a
long
standing
interpretation
of
the
board
of
the
act
said
that
the
board
has
no
adjudicatory
responsibility
in
major
disputes.
secondly,
the
legislative
history
again
which
we
set
forth
in
detail
in
our
brief
shows
that
the
congress
or
that
the
frameworks
of
the
act
rather
where
anxious
to
withdraw
any
adjudicatory
authority
from
the
board
so
as
to
preserve
its
neutrality,
its
ability
to
conciliate.
next,
the
board
has
never
as
a
matter
of
practice
enforced
2
first,
as
the
materials
that
we
set
forth
in
our
brief
establish
i
think.
and
then
finally,
i
think
that
it
ought
to
be
noted
that
the
mediation
board
would
be
powerless
to
enforce
section
2
first
in
bearing
in
a
very
great
many
cases
because
once
the
board
releases
its
jurisdiction
then
it's
out
of
the
picture
for
the
30-day
cooling
off
period
after
that
and
for
the
next
60
days
associated
with
the
hearings,
proceedings
of
an
emergency
board.
and
so
it’s
for
these
reasons
that
we
urged
that
section
2
first
is
judicially
enforceable
by
the
courts
and
not
by
the
board.
now,
as
to
norris-laguardia.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes
mr.
justice
white?
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
i
think
they
have
to
terminate
mr.
justice
white,
that’s
what
the
statute
to
me
says.
it
says
that
when
the
board
has
exhausted
it
efforts
to
bring
the
parties
to
an
agreement
and
it
can’t
do
it,
that
it’s
supposed
to
release
the
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
understand
that
in
the
florida
east
coast
case
where
the
government
is
now
urging
that
the
florida
east
coast
violated
section
2
first
by
not
bargaining,
the
florida
east
coast
sued
the
mediation
board
to
get
them
to
release
the
case
and
the
mediation
board
released
the
case
before
that
case
can
come.
and
i
think
the
mediation
board
is
obliged
to
release
it
after
a
reasonable
period
of
time
and
i
think
they
do
that,
i
think
they
do
that.
i
don’t
think
that
the
government
would
be
taking
the
position
in
florida
east
coast
that
the
railroad
had
violated
2
first,
if
it
had
also
thought
that
the
mediation
board
had
violated
its
responsibilities
by
releasing
that
case.
now,
as
to
norris-laguardia,
our
position,
put
as
simply
as
i
can
is
that
based
on
this
court’s
prior
decisions
and
the
legislative
history
of
norris-laguardia,
norris-laguardia
simply
does
not
apply
to
a
case
in
which
the
claim
is
that
there
has
been
a
violation
of
an
important
provision
of
the
railway
labor
act.
we
think
that’s
what
graham
and
steele
and
tunstall
and
virginian
and
chicago
river
say.
in
chicago
river
for
example
the
court
said
and
that
of
course
was
strike
injunction
suit,
said
that
this
court
is
authorized
the
use
of
injunctive
relief
to
vindicate
the
processes
of
the
railway
labor
act
and
has
held
that
the
specific
provisions
of
the
railway
labor
act
take
precedents
over
the
more
general
provisions
of
the
norris-laguardia.
that
principle
is
thoroughly
rooted
in
the
legislative
history
of
norris-laguardia
which
is
discussed
in
some
detail
in
our
reply
brief.
congressman
la
guardia
spoke
to
the
problem
and
he
said
quite
plainly
that
norris-laguardia
was
not
intended
to
touch
the
railway
labor
act.
and
the
lower
courts
in
a
consistent
and
long
line
of
decisions
since
chicago
river
have
applied
or
have
declined
to
apply
norris-laguardia
in
both
major
and
minor
disputes
where
the
claim
was
a
violation
of
one
of
the
significant
provisions
of
the
act.
now
the
amicus
suggests
that
an
exception
should
be
made
with
respect
to
section
2
first.
we’ve
discussed
the
various
policy
considerations
that
the
amicus
advances
on
our
reply
brief
and
i
don’t
have
time
to
deal
with
them
now
but
i
would
like
to
make
one
point
because
i
think
central
to
the
amicus’
analysis
is
the
suggestion
that
there’s
an
alternative
way
of
securing
the
interest
protected
by
section
2
first
and
that
is
by
getting
an
injunction
early
in
the
game
compelling
good
faith
bargaining
so
that
an
agreement
might
mature
before
a
strike.
now,
we
suggest
that
is
not
a
practical
remedy
because
it
would
require
a
bad
faith
bargaining
suit
to
be
instituted
right
in
the
middle
of
negotiations
in
the
earlier
middle
stages
and
to
institute
that
kind
of
litigation
we
think
would
be
destructive
of
collective
bargaining.
indeed,
we
think
that’s
what
this
court
said
in
substance
last
year
in
boyce
river
(ph)
in
discussing
the
availability
of
a
damage
remedy
and
there
the
court
said
that
the
institution
of
that
kind
of
litigation
would
be
damaging
to
the
relationships
between
the
parties.
now,
besides
that
and
equally
important,
we’re
dealing
here
with
the
statute
in
which
the
negotiating
periods
are
long
and
protracted
and
if
the
carrier
would
have
come
into
court
in
the
earlier
or
middle
stages
of
that
--
of
those
periods,
the
union
would
always
be
able
to
say
“well,
now
look
at
it,
there’s
a
long
road
ahead
of
us”
and
positions
inevitably
change
and
it
is
simply
too
early
to
make
a
determination
that
we’re
not
bargaining
in
good
faith
and
that
is
precisely
what
the
courts
have
said,
what
the
court
had
said
in
the
only
case
that
we’ve
been
able
to
discover
in
which
that
kind
of
relief
was
sought.
the
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
georgia
in
an
opinion
affirmed
by
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
adapted
by
that
court
said
in
substance
you’re
here
too
early,
this
suit
is
premature.
this
position
of
the
union
may
topple
of
its
own
weight
in
the
course
of
the
further
negotiations
and
discussions
that
were
required
by
the
act
so
that
it
is
only
at
the
terminal
stages
when
a
threat
of
strike
of
real
damage
is
imminent
that
the
courts
we
feel
will
entertain
a
suit
to
enforce
section
2
first.
i’d
like
if
i
have
any
time
left
i’d
like
to
reserve
it
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
haley
has
laid
such
a
stress
upon
the
role
of
the
mediation
board
that
i
thought
perhaps
it
might
be
useful
to
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
relevant
statutory
provision
here
which
is
section
5
first
of
the
act.
it’s
the
only
section
in
the
act
that
goes
to
the
duties
of
the
mediation
board,
it
says
this.
“that
the
said
board
shall
promptly
put
itself
in
communication
with
the
parties
to
such
controversy
and
shall
use
its
best
efforts
by
mediation
to
bring
them
to
agreement.
if
such
efforts
to
bring
about
an
amicable
settlement
through
mediation
shall
be
unsuccessful,
the
said
board
shall
at
once
endeavor
as
its
final
required
action
to
induce
the
parties
to
submit
their
controversy
to
arbitration.
if
arbitration
offer
is
refused,
the
board
shall
at
once
notify
both
parties
in
writing
that
its
mediatory
efforts
have
failed
and
then
the
status
quo
shelved
for
30
days.
mr.
haley
is
speaking
of
a
statutory
arrangement
under
which
the
decision
as
to
whether
2
first
that
had
been
complied
with
would
be
committed
by
the
congress
to
an
administrative
agency
and
then
it
would
be
specified
that
there
should
be
no
judicial
review
of
those
determinations.
surely,
the
congress
could
write
such
a
statute,
but
it
is
simply
importing
too
much
in
the
statutory
language
to
conclude
that
that
is
the
system
of
the
congress
here
established.
beyond
that,
the
practice
of
the
board
has
not
been
to
decide
section
2
first
questions.
mr.
haley,
referred
to
a
speech
given
by
mr.
gamser,
the
former
chairman
of
the
board.
it
is
quoted
impertinent
part
in
our
brief
on
page
76
of
footnote
31.
what
mr.
gamser
said
there
was
that
certain
airline
spokesmen
had
suggested
that
the
board
should
not
release
the
case
from
mediation
“if
either
party
has
not
in
the
opinion
of
the
board
made
every
effort
to
resolve
the
dispute,”
but
mr.
gamser
characterized
this
as
“advocating
a
greater
exercise
of
discretion
hereto
employed
by
the
board”
and
the
question
whether
“there
is
statutory
language
to
allow
the
board
to
make
such
a
determination”
and
then
he
went
on
to
discuss
the
procedural
steps
such
as
hearings
and
the
right
to
put
in
evidence
and
that
sort
of
thing
that
the
board
might
have
to
employ.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
with
respect
to
section
2
first,
mr.
justice
blackmun?
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes.
section
2
tenth
provides
for
criminal
penalties
for
violation
of
certain
of
the
subsections
of
section
2,
but
it
does
not
include
section
2
first.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
no,
there
is
not
as
this
court
in
effect
held
in
virginian
because
the
penalty
section
does
not
touch
section
2
ninth
either
and
of
course,
the
court,
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
court
in
virginian
held
2
ninth
enforceable
and
beyond
that
the
court
in
the
texas
&
n.
o.
case
said
that
the
absence
of
judicial
penalty
is
not
determinative
with
respect
to
considering
the
enforceability
of
these
sections,
so
that
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
oh!
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
i’m
just
assuming
to
arguendo
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
to
treat
with.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
section
2
first
says
but
let
me
point
out
again
that
the
injunction
itself
requires,
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
--
used
the
words
treat
with
and
exert
every
reasonable
effort.
now,
i’m
hard
pressed
to
understand
how
virginian
can
be
distinguished
in
any
way.
i
was
simply
making
the
point
with
respect
to
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
question
that
even
if
one
put
section
2
first
aside
that
the
penalty
provisions
don’t
apply
to
2
ninth
either
and
surely
no
one
would
question
that
virginian
enforced
2
ninth,
but
the
way
or
the
effort
to
distinguish
virginian
i
suggest
simply
has
to
fail
but
let
me
put
it
this
way.
if
in
the
wake
of
that
affirmance
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
injunction
in
virginian,
the
railroad
had
failed
to
exert
every
reasonable
effort,
i
submit
that
a
contempt
action
would
lie.
the
court
simply
did
not
exhort
the
parties
in
virginian,
it
affirmed
an
injunction
which
is
presumably
binding
on
the
parties.
thank
you.
