mr.
john
h.
haley,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
i
can
best
respond
to
the
argument
of
counsel
for
a
petitioner
by
outlining
the
act
itself
rather
than
to
deal
with
it.
section
2
first
with
which
we’re
dealing
here
was
not
ever
intended
by
congress
and
has
never
been
held
by
this
court
to
be
judicially
enforceable.
section
2
first
was
intended
by
congress
to
be
enforceable
by
the
national
mediation
board
through
the
power
of
the
national
mediation
board
to
maintain
or
to
continue
to
require
the
status
quo
to
be
maintained
and
to
prevent
self
help.
until
the
mediation
board
should
be
satisfied
that
the
bargaining
conduct
of
the
parties
had
been
such
as
to
meet
the
requirements
of
section
2
first.
and
further
we
would
urge
that
to
subject
the
bargaining
conduct
of
the
parties
both
prior
to
mediation
and
during
the
compulsory
mediation
for
which
the
act
provides
to
a
judicial
review
after
mediation
would
destroy
the
whole
scheme
of
the
railway
labor
act
for
the
resolution
of
major
disputes
because
it
would
necessarily
interfere
with
the
relationship
that
the
national
mediation
board
must
and
thus
maintain
its
dealings
with
the
parties
in
order
to
bring
about
agreement
and
to
require
it
to
disclose
those
--
its
dealings
with
the
parties
with
the
strike,
its
effectiveness
and
would
put
to
crux
at
the
bargaining
table
ex
post
facto
when
it
was
the
purpose
of
the
act
to
limit
the
functions
of
the
courts
in
these
cases.
section
2
first,
first
came
into
railway
labor
legislation
as
section
301
of
title
iii
of
the
transportation
act
of
1920
which
set
up
a
system
of
compulsory
arbitration
by
the
railway
labor
board
or
railway
labor
disputes
of
those
disputes
which
were
not
decided
by
the
parties
and
conference
under
what
section
301
then
provided
of
title
ii
--
iii
of
the
transportation
act
in
almost
the
same
language
that
the
parties
shall
make
every
reasonable
effort
to
resolve
disputes
and
those
which
could
not
resolve
were
it
be
decided
by
then
railway
labor
board.
this
court
first
considered
that
provision
and
that
language
in
the
pennsylvania
railroad
cases
in
1923
and
1925
and
held
that
section
301
which
is
the
equivalent
now
of
section
2
first
of
the
1926
act
was
not
mandatorialy
--
was
not
judicially
enforceable.
that
--
notwithstanding
it
was
couched
in
mandatory
language
because
of
the
absence
of
any
provision
for
a
penalty
for
its
violation
or
any
other
indications
that
it
was
intended
to
be
judicially
enforceable.
following
that
decision
by
this
court,
there
occurred
the
1921
and
22
shop
class
strike
which
involves
some
600,000
and
700,000
railroad
employees
and
railroad
labor
relations
and
railroad
labor
legislation
was
a
subject
of
considerable
public
concern
at
that
time.
it
was
--
this
need
for
change
was
recognized
in
the
platforms
of
both
political
parties.
it
had
been
the
subject
of
three
presidential
messages
to
congress.
hence
when
section
2
first
that
we
now
have
was
enacted
it
was
the
section
2
first
of
the
railway
labor
act
of
1926
enacted
in
those
circumstances.
an
agreement
by
both
parties
as
to
the
provisions
of
the
act
and
it
was
enacted
in
substantially
the
same
language
as
section
301
of
title
iii
of
the
transportation
act
of
1920
and
it
has
remained
in
those
words
since
1926
and
thus
it
was
enacted
without
the
prohibitory
provision
or
any
other
provision
that
this
court
thought
in
the
pennsylvania
cases
was
necessary
to
show
a
judicially
enforceable
intent.
it
has
stayed
that
way
since.
in
enacting
the
railway
labor
act
of
1926,
the
senate
reports
show
and
the
house
reports
show
that
the
congress
deliberately
rejected
a
compulsory
system
of
resolving
railway
labor
disputes
with
adequate
means
for
judicial
enforcement
as
it
might
have
done
merely
by
making
title
iii
of
the
transportation
act
of
1920
judicially
enforceable,
but
instead
the
parties
agreed
to
a
process
which
has
been
in
effect
since.
it
left
section
2
first
in
its
non-justiciable
language,
but
prohibited
changes
by
carriers
and
agreements
without
notices.
it
prohibited
the
status
quo
being
changed
after
notice
until
after
mediation
was
concluded,
and
established
the
mediation
board
as
the
representative
of
the
public
in
the
dispute
and
provided
for
compulsory
mediation
by
the
government
agency,
the
mediation
board.
the
virginian
case
that
counsel
spoke
of,
found
a
judicially
enforceable
obligation
in
the
prohibition
of
section
2
ninth
which
came
into
the
act
in
1934
against
the
railroad
dealing
with
a
representative
of
its
employees
other
than
the
representative
certified
by
the
national
mediation
board.
up
to
that
time,
the
question
of
representation
of
the
employees
was
what
--
was
the
trouble
in
railroad
labor
legislation
because
collective
bargaining
had
long
been
accepted
as
the
fact
in
the
railroad
industry.
now,
the
injunction
in
that
case
prohibited
the
railroad
from
dealing
with
other
than
the
representatives
certified
by
the
mediation
board
and
it
also
required
the
railroad
to
deal
with
the
certified
representative
and
in
the
manner
prescribed
by
section
2
first.
but
in
that
case,
the
court
did
not
suggest
that
the
district
court
retain
jurisdiction,
there
had
been
no
negotiations
up
to
that
time.
didn’t
suggest
the
district
court
retain
jurisdiction
to
determine
whether
the
ensuing
negotiations
met
the
requirements
of
section
2
first.
instead,
this
court
suggested
that
in
the
event
conferences
failed
the
services
of
the
mediation
board
be
invoked
and
thus
this
court
suggested
the
antithesis
of
just
a
further
litigation,
need
further
mediation
and
the
attachment
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
mediation
board
to
prevent
self-help
by
maintaining
the
status
quo
until
the
mediation
board
should
determine
whether
there
was
compliance
with
2
first.
thereafter,
when
the
lower
courts
commenced
to
assume
jurisdiction
of
disputes
arising
under
the
railway
labor
act,
this
court
in
the
trilogy
of
cases
limited
the
apparent
general
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts.
in
1943
in
switchmen’s
union
against
the
national
mediation
board,
general
committee
of
adjustment
versus
the
southern
pacific
and
general
committee
of
adjustment
of
m-k-t
railroad
and
in
those
cases,
in
the
k-d
case
made
it
plain
again
that
section
2
first
was
not
justiciable
and
the
court
has
recognized
through
the
years
most
recently
on
detroit
and
toledo
shoreline
that
it
is
the
national
mediation
board
which
determines
whether
and
when
the
conduct
of
the
parties
complies
with
section
2
first,
not
the
courts.
and
its
the
national
mediation
board
which
has
the
power
to
deprive
the
parties
of
self-help
or
to
enforce
compliance
with
2
first
by
continuing
to
deprive
a
party
of
self-help
or
when
it’s
satisfied
that
the
section
2
first
requirement
has
been
met
and
their
dispute
cannot
be
resolved
to
remit
the
parties
to
self-help.
mr.
john
h.
haley,
jr.
as
i
interpret
that
mr.
chief
justice,
justice
rutley
was
there
speaking
of
the
power
of
the
courts
to
maintain
the
status
quo
until
the
mediation
board
should
determine
that
section
2
first
had
been
complied
with.
he
was
talking
there
too
of
the
power
of
the
courts
to
compel
a
railroad
to
deal
initially
with
the
certified
representative
and
of
the
employees
and
to
keep
the
railroad
from
dealing
with
some
non-certified
representative
of
the
people.
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
to
enforce
the
status
quo,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
to
hold
the
parties
in
to
compliance
with
those
status
quo
provisions
until
the
administrative
process
of
the
act
had
been
exhausted.
the
national
mediation
board
is
well
aware
of
its
duties
and
responsibilities
to
enforce
compliance
with
the
provisions
of
section
2
first
and
that,
that
awareness
is
perfectly
apparent
from
a
recent
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
this
circuit,
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
in
the
machinist’s
case
against
the
national
mediation
board.
it’s
also
apparent
from
the
speech
of
mr.
howard
gamser,
formerly
chairman
and
a
long
time
member
of
the
national
mediation
board
and
from
professor
smith’s
article
in
the
michigan
law
review,
together
with
the
complexity
of
the
problem
of
determining
whether
every
reasonable
effort
is
being
made
and
all
those
are
cited,
but
the
board
obtained
its
information
with
respect
to
the
quality
of
the
bargaining,
not
in
an
open
hearing,
but
in
conferences
with
the
parties
separately
and
together
as
its
usual
practice.
it
talks
with
each
party,
obtains
the
information
as
to
their
position,
it
participates
in
the
bargaining
sessions
of
the
parties
and
considers
and
observes
their
conduct
during
those
negotiations
and
in
its
private
confidential
talks
with
them
and
on
the
basis
of
its
direct
contact
with
the
parties,
both
secretly
and
formally
and
in
observing
the
parties
upon
their
conduct
with
each
other
across
the
bargaining
table
necessarily
makes
a
determination
as
to
what
and
when
each
party
has
made
every
reasonable
effort
to
resolve
the
dispute.
and
thus
necessarily
decides
whether
to
continue
to
prevent
the
exercise
of
a
party
by
exercising
self-help
by
a
party
whose
only
seeking
to
go
through
the
motions,
something
that
is
hard
to
conceive
that
a
reunion
would
ever
do
because
it
can
only
accomplish
something
by
securing
agreements,
but
nevertheless
it's
still
that
informal
method
that
the
mediation
board
obtains
the
information,
upon
which
it
bases
a
determination
as
to
whether
to
continue
its
jurisdiction
and
thus
deny
self-help
or
to
that
section
2
first
has
been
complied
with
and
the
dispute
cannot
be
resolved
and
the
parties
should
be
remitted
to
self-help.
the
board’s
conclusion
that
it
reaches
from
its
conduct
with
the
parties
should
not
be
subject
to
judicial
review
because
as
it
appears
from
the
testimony
or
from
the
legislative
history
and
the
information
furnished
the
court
in
the
machinist’s
case
against
the
national
mediation
board,
the
legislative
purpose
or
the
congressional
purpose
of
providing
for
compulsory
mediation
of
disputes
was
to
cloak
the
efforts
of
the
mediation
board
in
or
to
cover
them
or
to
eliminate
them
from
public
scrutiny
because
otherwise,
the
effectiveness
of
the
mediation
board
in
determining
when
a
party
was
making
every
reasonable
effort
contemplated
by
section
2
first
as
well
as
its
mediatory
function
would
be
destroyed
by
requiring
it
to
come
into
court
and
tell
what
each
party
had
said
to
it,
what
each
party
had
said
to
the
others
because
in
the
next
case
no
one
would
say
anything
to
the
mediator
or
to
the
national
mediation
board.
and
that
for
fear
that
they
would
then
be
hauled
into
court
later,
but
if
the
mediation
board
can
talk
to
this
party
and
find
out
its
position,
talk
to
this
party
and
find
out
its
position,
it
may
well
bring
them
together.
the
same
situation
is
true
under
section
2
ninth
with
respect
to
the
mediation
board's
certification
of
the
representative
of
the
parties.
it’s
not
required
to
conduct
a
public
hearing,
it’s
not
required
to
make
any
order,
it’s
not
required
to
file
any
findings
of
fact.
it
expresses
its
conclusion
in
the
form
of
a
certificate
as
to
who
is
the
representative
of
a
particular
class
or
craft.
in
dealing
with
whether
a
party
has
complied
with
section
2
first
and
should
be
remitted
to
self-help
or
that
both
parties
should
be,
the
mediation
board
merely
notifies
the
parties
of
the
failure
of
its
efforts.
it
conducts
no
public
hearing,
but
to
expose
its
mediatory
efforts
to
subsequent
litigation
would
destroy
its
function
and
obviously
if
both
parties
and
the
mediation
board
knew
that
at
the
end
of
the
line
and
notwithstanding
exhaustion
of
the
requirements
of
the
act,
the
courts
would
make
the
ultimate
determination
as
to
whether
there
had
been
compliance
with
section
2
first
and
whether
that
the
courts
might
require
the
parties
to
renegotiate
or
re-mediate
in
order
to
accomplish
compliance
with
section
2
first
plainly
and
clearly
was
never
contemplated
by
congress.
there’s
not
a
suggestion
of
it
in
the
hearings
before
the
house
or
the
senate.
there’s
not
a
suggestion
of
it.
the
suggestion
is
that
the
process
that
was
being
established
was
a
voluntary
process,
not
a
compulsory
process,
not
compulsory
arbitration
such
as
was
done
by
the
director
general
during
the
government
operation
of
the
railroads
after
which
title
iii
of
the
transportation
act
of
1920
was
patterned,
but
instead,
it
was
to
provide
for
the
amicable
disposition
of
the
matter
and
inducement
to
the
parties
to
bargain
and
to
reach
an
agreement.
it
was
not
conceived
as
was
the
national
labor
relations
board
as
an
agency
to
enforce,
seize
--
to
make
and
enforce
seize
and
deceits
orders.
they
proceed,
as
this
court
has
recognized
many
times,
upon
different
basis.
one
on
compulsion,
the
labor
management
relations
act
with
all
the
attendant
troubles
it’s
gotten
into
in
trying
to
determine
whether
parties
had
engaged
in
good
faith
bargaining.
the
railway
labor
act
proceeded
on
a
different
basis.
had
congress
intended
courts
to
play
a
part
at,
they
could
so
have
provided
in
1926,
in
1934
when
the
act
was
slightly
amended.
it
would
have
been
possible
at
any
injunction
to
make
section
2
first
justiciable
by
providing
a
penalty
for
its
violation
or
that
courts
shall
have
the
jurisdiction
to
determine
whether
there
has
been
compliance
with
it
notwithstanding
negotiations,
mediations,
and
an
investigation
report
by
an
emergency
board.
we
respectfully
suggest
to
the
court
that
it
not
or
i
want
to
mention
piedmont
case
because
under
that
case
with
which
the
seventh
circuit
thought
its
opinion
in
conflict,
the
court
remanded
the
case
for
a
determination
by
the
district
court,
if
it
should
determine
that
there
was
in
fact
a
minor
or
major
dispute.
whether
the
conduct
of
the
parties
in
the
prior
negotiation
and
mediation
had
fulfilled
the
requirements
of
section
2
first.
thus,
that
court
and
to
require
the
redoing,
remediation,
or
renegotiation,
i
assume
the
courts
have
the
jurisdiction
to
require
that
of
the
dispute,
until
the
district
court
should
be
satisfied
that
the
parties
had
made
every
reasonable
effort
contemplated
by
section
2
first
to
resolve
the
dispute.
now,
in
the
piedmont
case
as
in
all
this
other
group
of
case
law,
upon
which
the
petitioner
relies
and
which
the
petitioner
cites,
the
question
before
this
court
has
never
been
raised
nor
decided
as
petitioner
concedes
on
page
9
of
its
reply
brief.
those
decisions
have
been
rendered
upon
the
assumption
that
section
2
first
is
justiciable.
they
have
been
rendered
upon
the
basis
of
statements
that
are
pure
dictum
in
opinions
of
this
court
as
for
example
on
mr.
chief
justice
burger
inquired
of
the
burley
case.
what
was
said
there
about
section
2
first
and
the
procedures
of
the
act
with
respect
to
major
disputes
was
dictum
because
that
case
was
concerned
with
the
legal
authority
of
a
union
to
compromise
a
monetary
claim
of
an
employee,
a
minor
dispute
pending
before
the
national
labor
adjustment
court.
mr.

of

of
the

mr.

--
of

mr.

black
and
where
are

i
might

it
so
that

while
this
court
has
not
of
course
decided
the
precise
issue
before
it
in
this
case
and
that’s
the
language
i
refer
to.
so
that
as
we
--
mr.

haley,
jr.
but
i
read
it
--
mr.
john
h.
haley,
jr.
well,
i
read
it
just
the
other
way,
but
i
did
want
to
mention
that
because
norris-laguardia
has
been
mentioned
in
that,
as
the
case
depends
now,
unless
section
2
first,
with
section
2
first
not
now
being
treated
by
this
court
as
justiciable
or
imposing
a
judicial
obligation,
the
violation
of
it
obviously
is
not
an
unlawful
act
within
the
meaning
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
for
which
an
anti-strike
injunction
might
be
issued.
to
hold
it
justiciable
and
to
hold
it
an
affirmative
duty
of
the
violation
of
which
would
be
a
violation
of
the
act,
would
then
raised
questions
under
norris-laguardia
and
might
make
section
2
first
then
an
unlawful
act
for
which
an
anti-strike
injunction
might
be
authorized
by
a
norris-laguardia,
but
unless
and
until
it
is
so
construed
by
this
court
it
does
not
have
that
statute
and
as
judge
friendly
observed
in
the
switchmen's
union
or
rock
island
against
the
switchmen's
union
case,
he
questioned
whether
the
violation
of
section
2
first
could
amount
to
and
thus
amount
to
the
non-lawful
act
for
which
norris-laguardia
might
want
an
anti-strike
injunction.
as
it’s
construing
it
as
a
non-judiciable,
non-judicially
enforceable
duty
as
this
court
has
in
the
past,
there
it
could
serve
no
basis
for
it,
could
not
serve
as
a
basis
for
it.
an
anti-strike
injunction
under
norris-laguardia
act
and
we
would
not
be
confronted
with
all
the
other
questions
that
would
arise
if
it
should
be
--
if
norris-laguardia
should
be
brought
to
play
by
pleading
it
as
a
legally
enforceable
obligation,
the
violation
of
which
might
constitute
the
violation
of
the
duty
under
the
act
together
with
many,
many
other
problems
which
if
there
were
a
little
more
time
would
arise
by
this
court
departing
from
its
treatment
of
section
2
first
as
non-justiciable,
a
position
it
has
held
for
forty
years
and
now
holding
it
justiciable
and
taking
a
position
ex
post
facto
at
the
bargaining
table
in
railway
labor
act
disputes,
a
function
which
i
do
not
believe
congress
ever
intended
the
courts
to
perform.
thank
you.
mr.
john
h.
haley,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
i
can
best
respond
to
the
argument
of
counsel
for
a
petitioner
by
outlining
the
act
itself
rather
than
to
deal
with
it.
section
2
first
with
which
we’re
dealing
here
was
not
ever
intended
by
congress
and
has
never
been
held
by
this
court
to
be
judicially
enforceable.
section
2
first
was
intended
by
congress
to
be
enforceable
by
the
national
mediation
board
through
the
power
of
the
national
mediation
board
to
maintain
or
to
continue
to
require
the
status
quo
to
be
maintained
and
to
prevent
self
help.
until
the
mediation
board
should
be
satisfied
that
the
bargaining
conduct
of
the
parties
had
been
such
as
to
meet
the
requirements
of
section
2
first.
and
further
we
would
urge
that
to
subject
the
bargaining
conduct
of
the
parties
both
prior
to
mediation
and
during
the
compulsory
mediation
for
which
the
act
provides
to
a
judicial
review
after
mediation
would
destroy
the
whole
scheme
of
the
railway
labor
act
for
the
resolution
of
major
disputes
because
it
would
necessarily
interfere
with
the
relationship
that
the
national
mediation
board
must
and
thus
maintain
its
dealings
with
the
parties
in
order
to
bring
about
agreement
and
to
require
it
to
disclose
those
--
its
dealings
with
the
parties
with
the
strike,
its
effectiveness
and
would
put
to
crux
at
the
bargaining
table
ex
post
facto
when
it
was
the
purpose
of
the
act
to
limit
the
functions
of
the
courts
in
these
cases.
section
2
first,
first
came
into
railway
labor
legislation
as
section
301
of
title
iii
of
the
transportation
act
of
1920
which
set
up
a
system
of
compulsory
arbitration
by
the
railway
labor
board
or
railway
labor
disputes
of
those
disputes
which
were
not
decided
by
the
parties
and
conference
under
what
section
301
then
provided
of
title
ii
--
iii
of
the
transportation
act
in
almost
the
same
language
that
the
parties
shall
make
every
reasonable
effort
to
resolve
disputes
and
those
which
could
not
resolve
were
it
be
decided
by
then
railway
labor
board.
this
court
first
considered
that
provision
and
that
language
in
the
pennsylvania
railroad
cases
in
1923
and
1925
and
held
that
section
301
which
is
the
equivalent
now
of
section
2
first
of
the
1926
act
was
not
mandatorialy
--
was
not
judicially
enforceable.
that
--
notwithstanding
it
was
couched
in
mandatory
language
because
of
the
absence
of
any
provision
for
a
penalty
for
its
violation
or
any
other
indications
that
it
was
intended
to
be
judicially
enforceable.
following
that
decision
by
this
court,
there
occurred
the
1921
and
22
shop
class
strike
which
involves
some
600,000
and
700,000
railroad
employees
and
railroad
labor
relations
and
railroad
labor
legislation
was
a
subject
of
considerable
public
concern
at
that
time.
it
was
--
this
need
for
change
was
recognized
in
the
platforms
of
both
political
parties.
it
had
been
the
subject
of
three
presidential
messages
to
congress.
hence
when
section
2
first
that
we
now
have
was
enacted
it
was
the
section
2
first
of
the
railway
labor
act
of
1926
enacted
in
those
circumstances.
an
agreement
by
both
parties
as
to
the
provisions
of
the
act
and
it
was
enacted
in
substantially
the
same
language
as
section
301
of
title
iii
of
the
transportation
act
of
1920
and
it
has
remained
in
those
words
since
1926
and
thus
it
was
enacted
without
the
prohibitory
provision
or
any
other
provision
that
this
court
thought
in
the
pennsylvania
cases
was
necessary
to
show
a
judicially
enforceable
intent.
it
has
stayed
that
way
since.
in
enacting
the
railway
labor
act
of
1926,
the
senate
reports
show
and
the
house
reports
show
that
the
congress
deliberately
rejected
a
compulsory
system
of
resolving
railway
labor
disputes
with
adequate
means
for
judicial
enforcement
as
it
might
have
done
merely
by
making
title
iii
of
the
transportation
act
of
1920
judicially
enforceable,
but
instead
the
parties
agreed
to
a
process
which
has
been
in
effect
since.
it
left
section
2
first
in
its
non-justiciable
language,
but
prohibited
changes
by
carriers
and
agreements
without
notices.
it
prohibited
the
status
quo
being
changed
after
notice
until
after
mediation
was
concluded,
and
established
the
mediation
board
as
the
representative
of
the
public
in
the
dispute
and
provided
for
compulsory
mediation
by
the
government
agency,
the
mediation
board.
the
virginian
case
that
counsel
spoke
of,
found
a
judicially
enforceable
obligation
in
the
prohibition
of
section
2
ninth
which
came
into
the
act
in
1934
against
the
railroad
dealing
with
a
representative
of
its
employees
other
than
the
representative
certified
by
the
national
mediation
board.
up
to
that
time,
the
question
of
representation
of
the
employees
was
what
--
was
the
trouble
in
railroad
labor
legislation
because
collective
bargaining
had
long
been
accepted
as
the
fact
in
the
railroad
industry.
now,
the
injunction
in
that
case
prohibited
the
railroad
from
dealing
with
other
than
the
representatives
certified
by
the
mediation
board
and
it
also
required
the
railroad
to
deal
with
the
certified
representative
and
in
the
manner
prescribed
by
section
2
first.
but
in
that
case,
the
court
did
not
suggest
that
the
district
court
retain
jurisdiction,
there
had
been
no
negotiations
up
to
that
time.
didn’t
suggest
the
district
court
retain
jurisdiction
to
determine
whether
the
ensuing
negotiations
met
the
requirements
of
section
2
first.
instead,
this
court
suggested
that
in
the
event
conferences
failed
the
services
of
the
mediation
board
be
invoked
and
thus
this
court
suggested
the
antithesis
of
just
a
further
litigation,
need
further
mediation
and
the
attachment
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
mediation
board
to
prevent
self-help
by
maintaining
the
status
quo
until
the
mediation
board
should
determine
whether
there
was
compliance
with
2
first.
thereafter,
when
the
lower
courts
commenced
to
assume
jurisdiction
of
disputes
arising
under
the
railway
labor
act,
this
court
in
the
trilogy
of
cases
limited
the
apparent
general
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts.
in
1943
in
switchmen’s
union
against
the
national
mediation
board,
general
committee
of
adjustment
versus
the
southern
pacific
and
general
committee
of
adjustment
of
m-k-t
railroad
and
in
those
cases,
in
the
k-d
case
made
it
plain
again
that
section
2
first
was
not
justiciable
and
the
court
has
recognized
through
the
years
most
recently
on
detroit
and
toledo
shoreline
that
it
is
the
national
mediation
board
which
determines
whether
and
when
the
conduct
of
the
parties
complies
with
section
2
first,
not
the
courts.
and
its
the
national
mediation
board
which
has
the
power
to
deprive
the
parties
of
self-help
or
to
enforce
compliance
with
2
first
by
continuing
to
deprive
a
party
of
self-help
or
when
it’s
satisfied
that
the
section
2
first
requirement
has
been
met
and
their
dispute
cannot
be
resolved
to
remit
the
parties
to
self-help.
mr.
john
h.
haley,
jr.
as
i
interpret
that
mr.
chief
justice,
justice
rutley
was
there
speaking
of
the
power
of
the
courts
to
maintain
the
status
quo
until
the
mediation
board
should
determine
that
section
2
first
had
been
complied
with.
he
was
talking
there
too
of
the
power
of
the
courts
to
compel
a
railroad
to
deal
initially
with
the
certified
representative
and
of
the
employees
and
to
keep
the
railroad
from
dealing
with
some
non-certified
representative
of
the
people.
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
to
enforce
the
status
quo,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
to
hold
the
parties
in
to
compliance
with
those
status
quo
provisions
until
the
administrative
process
of
the
act
had
been
exhausted.
the
national
mediation
board
is
well
aware
of
its
duties
and
responsibilities
to
enforce
compliance
with
the
provisions
of
section
2
first
and
that,
that
awareness
is
perfectly
apparent
from
a
recent
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
this
circuit,
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
in
the
machinist’s
case
against
the
national
mediation
board.
it’s
also
apparent
from
the
speech
of
mr.
howard
gamser,
formerly
chairman
and
a
long
time
member
of
the
national
mediation
board
and
from
professor
smith’s
article
in
the
michigan
law
review,
together
with
the
complexity
of
the
problem
of
determining
whether
every
reasonable
effort
is
being
made
and
all
those
are
cited,
but
the
board
obtained
its
information
with
respect
to
the
quality
of
the
bargaining,
not
in
an
open
hearing,
but
in
conferences
with
the
parties
separately
and
together
as
its
usual
practice.
it
talks
with
each
party,
obtains
the
information
as
to
their
position,
it
participates
in
the
bargaining
sessions
of
the
parties
and
considers
and
observes
their
conduct
during
those
negotiations
and
in
its
private
confidential
talks
with
them
and
on
the
basis
of
its
direct
contact
with
the
parties,
both
secretly
and
formally
and
in
observing
the
parties
upon
their
conduct
with
each
other
across
the
bargaining
table
necessarily
makes
a
determination
as
to
what
and
when
each
party
has
made
every
reasonable
effort
to
resolve
the
dispute.
and
thus
necessarily
decides
whether
to
continue
to
prevent
the
exercise
of
a
party
by
exercising
self-help
by
a
party
whose
only
seeking
to
go
through
the
motions,
something
that
is
hard
to
conceive
that
a
reunion
would
ever
do
because
it
can
only
accomplish
something
by
securing
agreements,
but
nevertheless
it's
still
that
informal
method
that
the
mediation
board
obtains
the
information,
upon
which
it
bases
a
determination
as
to
whether
to
continue
its
jurisdiction
and
thus
deny
self-help
or
to
that
section
2
first
has
been
complied
with
and
the
dispute
cannot
be
resolved
and
the
parties
should
be
remitted
to
self-help.
the
board’s
conclusion
that
it
reaches
from
its
conduct
with
the
parties
should
not
be
subject
to
judicial
review
because
as
it
appears
from
the
testimony
or
from
the
legislative
history
and
the
information
furnished
the
court
in
the
machinist’s
case
against
the
national
mediation
board,
the
legislative
purpose
or
the
congressional
purpose
of
providing
for
compulsory
mediation
of
disputes
was
to
cloak
the
efforts
of
the
mediation
board
in
or
to
cover
them
or
to
eliminate
them
from
public
scrutiny
because
otherwise,
the
effectiveness
of
the
mediation
board
in
determining
when
a
party
was
making
every
reasonable
effort
contemplated
by
section
2
first
as
well
as
its
mediatory
function
would
be
destroyed
by
requiring
it
to
come
into
court
and
tell
what
each
party
had
said
to
it,
what
each
party
had
said
to
the
others
because
in
the
next
case
no
one
would
say
anything
to
the
mediator
or
to
the
national
mediation
board.
and
that
for
fear
that
they
would
then
be
hauled
into
court
later,
but
if
the
mediation
board
can
talk
to
this
party
and
find
out
its
position,
talk
to
this
party
and
find
out
its
position,
it
may
well
bring
them
together.
the
same
situation
is
true
under
section
2
ninth
with
respect
to
the
mediation
board's
certification
of
the
representative
of
the
parties.
it’s
not
required
to
conduct
a
public
hearing,
it’s
not
required
to
make
any
order,
it’s
not
required
to
file
any
findings
of
fact.
it
expresses
its
conclusion
in
the
form
of
a
certificate
as
to
who
is
the
representative
of
a
particular
class
or
craft.
in
dealing
with
whether
a
party
has
complied
with
section
2
first
and
should
be
remitted
to
self-help
or
that
both
parties
should
be,
the
mediation
board
merely
notifies
the
parties
of
the
failure
of
its
efforts.
it
conducts
no
public
hearing,
but
to
expose
its
mediatory
efforts
to
subsequent
litigation
would
destroy
its
function
and
obviously
if
both
parties
and
the
mediation
board
knew
that
at
the
end
of
the
line
and
notwithstanding
exhaustion
of
the
requirements
of
the
act,
the
courts
would
make
the
ultimate
determination
as
to
whether
there
had
been
compliance
with
section
2
first
and
whether
that
the
courts
might
require
the
parties
to
renegotiate
or
re-mediate
in
order
to
accomplish
compliance
with
section
2
first
plainly
and
clearly
was
never
contemplated
by
congress.
there’s
not
a
suggestion
of
it
in
the
hearings
before
the
house
or
the
senate.
there’s
not
a
suggestion
of
it.
the
suggestion
is
that
the
process
that
was
being
established
was
a
voluntary
process,
not
a
compulsory
process,
not
compulsory
arbitration
such
as
was
done
by
the
director
general
during
the
government
operation
of
the
railroads
after
which
title
iii
of
the
transportation
act
of
1920
was
patterned,
but
instead,
it
was
to
provide
for
the
amicable
disposition
of
the
matter
and
inducement
to
the
parties
to
bargain
and
to
reach
an
agreement.
it
was
not
conceived
as
was
the
national
labor
relations
board
as
an
agency
to
enforce,
seize
--
to
make
and
enforce
seize
and
deceits
orders.
they
proceed,
as
this
court
has
recognized
many
times,
upon
different
basis.
one
on
compulsion,
the
labor
management
relations
act
with
all
the
attendant
troubles
it’s
gotten
into
in
trying
to
determine
whether
parties
had
engaged
in
good
faith
bargaining.
the
railway
labor
act
proceeded
on
a
different
basis.
had
congress
intended
courts
to
play
a
part
at,
they
could
so
have
provided
in
1926,
in
1934
when
the
act
was
slightly
amended.
it
would
have
been
possible
at
any
injunction
to
make
section
2
first
justiciable
by
providing
a
penalty
for
its
violation
or
that
courts
shall
have
the
jurisdiction
to
determine
whether
there
has
been
compliance
with
it
notwithstanding
negotiations,
mediations,
and
an
investigation
report
by
an
emergency
board.
we
respectfully
suggest
to
the
court
that
it
not
or
i
want
to
mention
piedmont
case
because
under
that
case
with
which
the
seventh
circuit
thought
its
opinion
in
conflict,
the
court
remanded
the
case
for
a
determination
by
the
district
court,
if
it
should
determine
that
there
was
in
fact
a
minor
or
major
dispute.
whether
the
conduct
of
the
parties
in
the
prior
negotiation
and
mediation
had
fulfilled
the
requirements
of
section
2
first.
thus,
that
court
and
to
require
the
redoing,
remediation,
or
renegotiation,
i
assume
the
courts
have
the
jurisdiction
to
require
that
of
the
dispute,
until
the
district
court
should
be
satisfied
that
the
parties
had
made
every
reasonable
effort
contemplated
by
section
2
first
to
resolve
the
dispute.
now,
in
the
piedmont
case
as
in
all
this
other
group
of
case
law,
upon
which
the
petitioner
relies
and
which
the
petitioner
cites,
the
question
before
this
court
has
never
been
raised
nor
decided
as
petitioner
concedes
on
page
9
of
its
reply
brief.
those
decisions
have
been
rendered
upon
the
assumption
that
section
2
first
is
justiciable.
they
have
been
rendered
upon
the
basis
of
statements
that
are
pure
dictum
in
opinions
of
this
court
as
for
example
on
mr.
chief
justice
burger
inquired
of
the
burley
case.
what
was
said
there
about
section
2
first
and
the
procedures
of
the
act
with
respect
to
major
disputes
was
dictum
because
that
case
was
concerned
with
the
legal
authority
of
a
union
to
compromise
a
monetary
claim
of
an
employee,
a
minor
dispute
pending
before
the
national
labor
adjustment
court.
mr.
john
h.
haley,
jr.
of
the
reply
brief
of
the
--
mr.
john
h.
haley,
jr.
--
of
the
railroads
reply
brief
mr.
justice
black
and
where
are
they
--
i
might
read
it
so
that
--
while
this
court
has
not
of
course
decided
the
precise
issue
before
it
in
this
case
and
that’s
the
language
i
refer
to.
so
that
as
we
--
mr.
john
h.
haley,
jr.
but
i
read
it
--
mr.
john
h.
haley,
jr.
well,
i
read
it
just
the
other
way,
but
i
did
want
to
mention
that
because
norris-laguardia
has
been
mentioned
in
that,
as
the
case
depends
now,
unless
section
2
first,
with
section
2
first
not
now
being
treated
by
this
court
as
justiciable
or
imposing
a
judicial
obligation,
the
violation
of
it
obviously
is
not
an
unlawful
act
within
the
meaning
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
for
which
an
anti-strike
injunction
might
be
issued.
to
hold
it
justiciable
and
to
hold
it
an
affirmative
duty
of
the
violation
of
which
would
be
a
violation
of
the
act,
would
then
raised
questions
under
norris-laguardia
and
might
make
section
2
first
then
an
unlawful
act
for
which
an
anti-strike
injunction
might
be
authorized
by
a
norris-laguardia,
but
unless
and
until
it
is
so
construed
by
this
court
it
does
not
have
that
statute
and
as
judge
friendly
observed
in
the
switchmen's
union
or
rock
island
against
the
switchmen's
union
case,
he
questioned
whether
the
violation
of
section
2
first
could
amount
to
and
thus
amount
to
the
non-lawful
act
for
which
norris-laguardia
might
want
an
anti-strike
injunction.
as
it’s
construing
it
as
a
non-judiciable,
non-judicially
enforceable
duty
as
this
court
has
in
the
past,
there
it
could
serve
no
basis
for
it,
could
not
serve
as
a
basis
for
it.
an
anti-strike
injunction
under
norris-laguardia
act
and
we
would
not
be
confronted
with
all
the
other
questions
that
would
arise
if
it
should
be
--
if
norris-laguardia
should
be
brought
to
play
by
pleading
it
as
a
legally
enforceable
obligation,
the
violation
of
which
might
constitute
the
violation
of
the
duty
under
the
act
together
with
many,
many
other
problems
which
if
there
were
a
little
more
time
would
arise
by
this
court
departing
from
its
treatment
of
section
2
first
as
non-justiciable,
a
position
it
has
held
for
forty
years
and
now
holding
it
justiciable
and
taking
a
position
ex
post
facto
at
the
bargaining
table
in
railway
labor
act
disputes,
a
function
which
i
do
not
believe
congress
ever
intended
the
courts
to
perform.
thank
you.
