ms.
rosenberg,
i
think
the
trouble
with
it
not
being
guilty
of
innocent
charge,
as
i
understand
in
moonshine
case
is
that
when
they
used
the
motion
to
suppress,
they’d
had
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
fact
that
you
find
it,
doesn’t
validate
the
warrant?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
this
alleged
affidavit
that
this
unknown
person
gave
to
the
agent,
what
kind
of
affidavit
was
that?
john
does
were
or
something?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
can
you
make
us
--
an
unnamed
person
make
a
sworn
statement?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
some
effort
on
the
part
of
the
informer
testing
he
could
to
be
sure
this
fellow
was
telling
the
truth?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
but
there
in
fact,
but
it
does
show
an
effort?
