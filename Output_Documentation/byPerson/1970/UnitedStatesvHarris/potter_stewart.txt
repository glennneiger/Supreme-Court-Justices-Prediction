is
it
clear

do
we

that
the

stewart
well,

justice

if
it's
not
for
you,
it’s
not
necessarily
hard
for
me
believe
that,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
do
you
think
it
follows
from
what
we
do
know
on
the
record
in
this
case
that
we
have
here
clearly
an
informant
who
would
not
given
information
in
the
past?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
surely
this
is
not
that
kind
of
thing

kentucky.
in
what
town
or
village
or
city,
do
you
know?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
that
it
was
a
very
small
community.
it
might
be
hard
for
a
law
enforcement
officer
or
his
agent
to
make
a
buy
because
i
suppose
it
could
be
assumed
that
everybody
knew
everybody
else
in
that
community
and
knew
his
business.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
your
point?
that
was

stewart
what

justice
potter
stewart
the
word
prudent
in
the
context

feared

not
revealing
his
name
and
so
on.
it
seems
to
be
it
could
well
at

be
related
to
the
preceding
sentence
in
the
paragraph,
could
it
not?

it
had
nothing
to
do

not?
