mr.
steven
m.
umin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
search
that
took
place
here
in
the
circumstances
that
gave
rise
to
it,
took
place
in
middlesborough,
kentucky
and
a
little
shack
alleged
to
have
contain
alcohol
on
which
the
tax
was
not
paid.
but
in
fact,
the
circumstances
--
pardon?
mr.
steven
m.
umin
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
it
was.
it’s
on
dansbury
avenue
in
middlesborough.
now,
i’ve
seen
pictures
of
the
place
which
are
in
the
record
to
what
extent
middlesborough
was
a
big
city
or
not
is
something
i’m
not
familiar
with
your
honor.
the
circumstances
however
are
paralleled
by
similar
circumstances
in
every
metropolitan
area
and
indeed
now
suburban
areas
that
i’m
sure
this
court
is
all
too
familiar
with.
the
circumstance
in
which
a
law
enforcement
officer
familiar
with
some
reputation
of
a
particular
suspect
becomes
on
a
given
day
possessed
of
information
not
derived
from
his
own
observations,
but
from
the
say
so
of
the
layman
that
in
the
legal
stimulant
it's
harbored
in
a
given
house.
that
to
be
sure,
it
probably
happens
hundreds
of
times
a
day
in
metropolises
of
this
country
with
respect
to
narcotics.
the
decision
in
this
case
will
therefore
affect
those
cases
gravely
as
well
it
will,
the
pursuit
of
illegal
whiskey
in
the
back
woods.
i
think
we
can
say
on
this
record
that
this
is
a
case
in
which
an
officer
got
possession
of
information
from
someone,
not
another
law
enforcement
officer
and
not
from
his
own
observations
to
the
effect
that
there
was
an
illegal
stimulant
in
this
case,
non-tax
paid
whiskey
in
someone’s
premises.
the
record
doesn’t
show
a
number
of
things.
it
doesn’t
show
with
any
great
clarity
that
this
was
a
first
time
informant
or
indeed
even
someone
who
may
have
been
unreliable
in
the
past.
to
be
sure,
this
court
has
counseled
that
magistrates
interpret
search
warrants,
affidavits
for
search
warrants
in
the
light
of
common
sense.
the
government
here
we
have
common
sense
suggests,
first
that
prudent
means
reliable,
perhaps
not
credible
but
reliable.
and
secondly,
--
pardon?
mr.
steven
m.
umin
no,
it
certainly
wouldn’t,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
yes,
your
honor.
that
of
course
is
not
this
case,
although,
i
think
it
would
be
insufficient
under
this
court’s
standards
in
aguilar.
aguilar
was
precisely
that
sort
of
case.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
no,
i
certainly
would
not.
in
fact,
i
would
plan
to
assume
though
not
concede,
this
was
a
first
time
informant
for
purposes
of
the
argument
i
would
want
to
make.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
of
course
not,
your
honor.
there’s
nothing
in
this
record
to
suggest
that.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
i
wouldn’t
suggest
that
negates
it
but
particularly
in
the
informer
context,
it
may
well
bear
a
strong
inference
of
unreliability.
a
reliable
--
mr.
steven
m.
umin
in
the
informer
context
the
word
prudent
may
bear
a
strong
inference
of
unreliability.
a
prudent
narcotics
informer
may
well
be
one
who
makes
who
makes
educated
guesses
about
who
it
is
in
the
community
may
well
have
a
bottle
of
illegal
liquor
on
his
premises.
because
he’s
being
paid
for
the
number
of
people
he
actually
turns
up
having
seen
roosevelt
harris
at
a
party
say,
he,
at
which
illegal
liquor
was
served,
you
take
a
guess
that
roosevelt
harris
may
have
a
bottle
of
liquor
in
that
--
in
his
house.
it
may
be
perfectly
prudent
for
him
under
those
circumstances
to
suggest
to
an
officer
or
find
in
a
list
of
30
or
40
people
from
whom
search
warrants
maybe
obtained
that
one
such
person
is
roosevelt
harris.
now,
if
it
turns
up
that
in
29
cases,
the
liquor
is
in
fact
found,
the
informant
would
subsequently
become
reliable,
but
it’s
that
one
case
we’re
concerned
about
and
a
prudent
narcotics
or
liquor
informant
may
well
be
inclined
to
take
a
guess
just
on
the
chance
that
it
will
turn
up
reward
or
payment
or
whatever
it
is
encourages
him
to
continue
as
an
informant
something
that,
of
course,
this
record
says
absolutely
nothing
about.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
of
course,
in
the
jury
--
mr.
steven
m.
umin
it
indeed
would
but
in
the
jury
context,
there’s
a
fair
--
mr.
steven
m.
umin
no.
i
wouldn’t.
the
jury
may
have
a
right
to
--
mr.
steven
m.
umin
excuse
me.
i’m
sorry,
your
honor,
i
missed
that.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
no,
i
wouldn’t
suggest
that
the
magistrate
should
necessarily
presume
on
reliability
in
this
case.
i
suggest
simply
that
the
inference
of
reliability
knowing
what
is
known
about
narc
--
about
informants,
particularly
in
the
stimulant
context
is
not
compelling
at
all
from
the
word
prudence.
prudence
may
suggest
as
the
court
of
appeals
suggested
that
a
man
is
circumspect.
it
may
suggest
that
it
is
very
good
at
taking
educated
guesses
and
that
would
be
sensible
for
him
to
do
that.
i
don’t
suggest
that
unreliability
is
compelled
either.
but
that
the
inferences
are
equally
balanced
and
a
jury
could
well
begin
without
any
notion
of
what
prudence
meant
or
with
a
notion
that
it
meant
reliable
or
unreliable.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
certainly
--
mr.
steven
m.
umin
that
certainly
--
mr.
steven
m.
umin
that’s
the
point,
i
mean,
either
context
to
the
affidavit
and
the
context
of
informant
behavior
generally
lends
to
the
word
prudence
so
many
connotations
that
it’s
difficult
even
to
settle
on
a
meaning.
even
more
important
in
settling
a
meaning
is
coming
up
with
some
basis
for
a
magistrate
to
assess
whether
that
judgment
of
prudence
is
correct.
how
can
a
magistrate
know
what
the
word
prudent
means
in
an
affidavit?
what
it
implies
about
the
judgment
made
if
there
are
no
in
fact
circumstances
stated
in
the
affidavit
to
substantiate
the
meaning
of
prudence
in
this
context.
that
after
all
is
the
function
that
this
court
has
historically
attributed
to
the
magistrate.
the
check
before
the
search
upon
the
probability
that
the
search
is
warranted,
the
check
upon
a
judgment
that
a
man
is
reliable.
magistrate
in
this
case
would
have
to
first
define
prudent
in
a
way
that
would
allow
the
determination
of
the
liability
and
second,
speculating
in
the
dark
as
to
whether
this
man
was
properly
determined
to
be
reliable
or
prudent
or
whichever
was
settled
upon
by
the
officer
in
question.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
as
to
the
details,
your
honor,
i
think
there’s
very
little
you
can
attribute
to
that
in
this
context.
details
in
no
sense
resemble
the
details
in
draper
which
were
details
predictive
in
nature.
in
that
case,
it
could
be
said
that
when
details
given
by
an
informant
was
subsequently
confirmed
by
an
agent
and
after
all
they
had
a
chance
in
that
case
not
to
eventuate,
the
informant
became
more
credible
because
the
information
predicted
was
in
fact
confirmed
to
be
true.
and
indeed,
the
informant’s,
the
likelihood
that
the
informant
was
giving
personal
information
was
increased
by
the
nature
of
the
detail
in
draper.
there’s
virtually
no
real
detail
in
this
affidavit
at
all.
the
detail
given
pertains
to
the
relationship
among
buildings
on
a
given
--
in
a
given
residence
in
a
at
best
medium
size
town
publicly
observable
detail
that
suggests
no
particularly
intimacy
on
the
part
of
the
informant
or
any
particular
credibility.
indeed,
it
should
be
noted
that
as
to
that
detail,
the
investigator
in
this
case
didn’t
even
go
so
far
as
far
as
this
record
shows
to
confirm
that
before
applying
for
the
warrant.
so,
the
confirmation
aspect
of
draper
was
wholly
out
of
the
case
and
the
personal
observation
aspect
to
draper
is
likewise
not
here.
the
critical
point
is
though,
that
nothing
in
this
case,
as
decided
by
the
sixth
circuit
impairs
law
enforcement
at
all
or
certainly
not
to
any
degree
sufficient
to
outweigh
the
interest
of
the
individual
security.
that
after
all
is
the
test
under
the
fourth
amendment
is
a
search
reasonable.
reasonable
as
involved
balance
and
this
court
has
expressed
that
test
in
camara
and
terry
as
a
--
the
balancing
of
the
need
to
search
against
the
enormity
of
the
invasion.
in
this
case,
a
number
of
alternative
opportunities
were
presented
to
the
affiant
officer.
even
if
it
were
true,
that
a
buy
had
been
difficult
to
make
in
four
years,
a
fact
which
itself
would
undermine
it
seems
to
me
the
merit
of
the
--
of
the
notion
that
this
affidavit
created
probable
cause,
even
if
that
were
true,
that
wasn’t
the
only
technique
available.
such
a
buy
to
be
sure
would
be
constitutional
as
would
the
procedure
established
by
united
states
against
lewis
in
which
the
buy
is
not
made
by
the
informant
at
all,
but
by
a
government
agent
who
calls
the
premises
and
sees
whether
he
can
make
a
buy
there.
in
lewis,
the
government
agent
actually
went
to
the
premises
and
made
the
buy,
came
back
at
second
time,
made
another
buy
and
had
evidence
available
for
trial,
but
even
if
the
buy
were
not
possible,
in
the
course
of
the
conversation
as
mr.
justice
douglas
suggested
in
his
dissent
in
lewis,
in
the
course
of
the
conversation
about
the
buy,
the
homeowner
alleged
to
have
illegal
whiskey
on
his
premises
might
well
say
something
to
substantiate
probable
cause.
who
are
you?
i’ve
never
heard
you
before?
how
do
i
know
that
you’re
not
a
cop?
that
kind
of
conversation
with
a
government
agent
who
has
received
information
that
there
is
illegal
liquor
at
a
certain
place
might
well
and
i
would
suggest
in
many
instances
would
enhance
the
probable
cause
that
he
could
present
to
a
magistrate
in
an
affidavit.
so,
it’s
not
simply
the
question
of
whether
a
buy
was
available,
an
available
technique,
a
buy
by
the
informant
or
a
buy
by
the
government
agent
but
whether
other
investigative
techniques
in
this
case
such
a
mere
phone
call
would
not
have
in
fact
turn
up
enough
strongly
indicative
evidence
of
involvement
in
the
traffic
of
illegal
alcohol
as
to
warrant
a
proper
affidavit
in
this
case.
i
don’t
even
suggest
that
there
are
cases
in
which
that
kind
of
further
investigation
may
not
be
possible.
the
americans
for
law
enforcement
filing
an
amicus
curiae
brief
present
here
a
case,
in
which,
in
course
of
that
brief,
in
which
a
cash
register
is
stolen
from
a
grocery
store
and
the
cashier
in
the
grocery
store,
a
young
employee
some
days
later
observes
the
cash
register
in
somebody’s
house
and
here
is
the
owner
of
that
house
boosted
that
he
stole
it.
well,
that’s
not
a
situation
in
which
the
law
enforcement
can
make
a
buy
or
can
make
phone
calls
to
see
whether
they
can
make
a
buy.
and
so,
the
police
officer
in
the
real
life
case
posited
by
the
americans
for
law
enforcement
went
around
the
neighborhood,
asked
the
neighbors
of
the
informant,
“is
he
reliable?
is
he
credible?
what’s
his
reputation?”
checked
with
the
police,
to
see
whether
he
had
a
criminal
record
or
not?
checked
with
his
employer
to
see
whether
the
employee
would
have
any
motivation
in
that
case
to
lie
or
fabricate
or
distort
a
fact
that
just
as
strong
as
lying
in
the
formation
of
affidavit.
having
gone
through
that
process,
the
officer
could
at
least
present
in
an
affidavit
to
a
magistrate
the
notion
that
he
had
done
his
best
to
clear
the
reputation
of
this
informant
for
truth
and
veracity
in
that
environment.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
no,
your
honor.
it
certainly
wouldn’t.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
not
at
all,
your
honor.
i
don’t
believe
that’s
the
essence
of
my
claim.
first
of
all,
--
mr.
steven
m.
umin
certainly,
if
the
defense
has
done
an
ineffective
job
in
impeaching
the
credibility
of
that
witness,
an
opportunity
to
have
a
trial
but
not
before
the
magistrate,
now
that
conviction
can
stand,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
i
really
don’t
believe
that’s
implicit
in
the
argument.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
yes.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
that’s
certainly
true
and
even
in
such
a
circumstance
when
an
informant
is
named
in
an
affidavit,
one
of
the
functions
of
naming
an
affidavit
--
mr.
steven
m.
umin
no.
but
i
mean,
what
the
magistrate
has
in
that
case
is
the
power
to
call
the
informant
before
him
and
cross-examine
him.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
indeed,
the
very
opposite
is
true.
hearsay
is
permissible
in
a
warrant
affidavit
of
this
kind
and
it’s
for
that
very
reason
that
magistrates
in
this
court
have
insisted
upon
some
assessment
of
the
reliability
of
the
person
conveying
the
hearsay.
it’s
because
the
magistrate
will
be
satisfied
by
evidence
that
would
not
be
competent
in
trial,
that
you
want
at
least
some
assurance
that
the
person
conveying
the
hearsay
is
not
conveying
either
a
rumor
or
a
fabrication.
that
assurance
need
not
be
given
in
the
form
of
cross
examination.
it
need
not
be
given
in
the
form
of
disclosing
his
name
so
that
the
magistrate
can
call
him
before
him
and
cross-examine.
but
it
should
appear
in
the
affidavit
that
the
steps
that
it’s
reasonably
possible
for
law
enforcement
to
take
to
confirm
the
reliability
of
the
person
giving
the
hearsay,
have
been
taken
and
continued
to
substantiate
that
the
informant’s
credibility
stands
up.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
that
job
is
left
to
the
defendant,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
your
honor,
the
record
doesn’t
support
the
notion
that
there
was
an
affidavit
given
by
the
unknown
person
to
the
affiant.
it
supports
only
the
notion
that
a
verbal
statement
was
given
described
in
this
affidavit
as
sworn.
there
was
not
even
an
affidavit
from
this
informant.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
that’s
the
real
problem.
presumably,
the
government
relies
upon
to
the
extent
it
does
rely
upon
a
sworn
statement
which
to
some
extent
it
does
not.
the
effect
of
swearing
somebody
in
would
be
to
inhibit
the
chances
of
falsification
by
threatening
an
informant
with
perjury
or
prosecution
under
some
other
federal
false
statement
statute.
obviously,
that
the
function
of
inhibition
in
this
setting,
we
don’t
know
who
the
person
is
and
only
the
affiant
does
and
there’s
no
evidence
present
at
the
swearing
and
would
be
virtually
null.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
it
shows
some
effort
--
mr.
steven
m.
umin
certainly,
i
mean,
the
search
warrant
does
not
issue
as
a
price
for
effort.
it
does
issue
when
probable
cause
is
established
and
probable
cause
is
established
when
there’s
a
reasonable
basis
for
a
magistrate
to
infer
that
an
informant
is
credible.
merely
swearing
him
in
does
not
provide
a
reasonable
basis
in
these
circumstances
and
there
are
so
many
alternatives
available
to
an
affiant
in
this
circumstance,
without
disclosing
the
informant’s
name,
which
would
buttress
his
reliability.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
i
think
that
would
come
very
close
to
sufficiency.
the
magistrate
could
simply
then
call
for
it
and
see
if
he
wished
and
see
who
it
was.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
it
could
be
submitted
to
the
court
under
seal.
that
justification
would
be
very
weak
under
those
circumstances,
i
would
think,
for
the
court’s
knowledge
alone
and
from
that
point
on,
without
disclosure
to
the
rest
of
the
world.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
only
to
the
extent
that
the
affidavit
enabled
calling
the
informant
into
an
in-camera
session
altogether
would
it
go
to
the
informant’s
reliability,
your
honor.
in
any
event
of
course
that's
not
this
case,
there’s
no
affidavit
or
sworn
statement
here.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
yes,
for
whatever
that
may
mean
in
middlesborough,
kentucky
or
anywhere
else.
i
have
on
many
occasions
myself
certainly
have
sworn
on
the
stack
of
bibles
and
had
no
notion
to
time
that
i
was
threatened
with
perjury
or
threatened
with
anything
that
seriously
buttressed
of
my
reliability.
i
would
hope
that
at
all
times,
i’d
tell
the
truth
but
i
don’t
think
that
court
--
that
kind
of
assertion
which
is
on
this
record
the
swearing
may
well
have
been
does
much
to
buttress
anyone’s
reliability.
given
the
alternatives
that
are
available
to
law
enforcement,
in
a
circumstance
like
this,
involving
minimal
law
enforcement
impingement
and
indeed
alternatives
that
are
commonly
used
throughout
the
country,
the
suggestion
that
this
court
ought
to
put
its
(inaudible)
upon
a
confirmation
of
reliability
amounting
to
no
more
than
the
use
of
an
ambiguous
term
in
an
affidavit
is
a
suggestion
in
effect
that
this
court
can
sign
over
to
the
police,
the
security
of
persons
and
their
houses,
not
simply
the
security
of
persons
and
their
houses
in
the
discretion
of
the
police,
but
in
the
discretion
of
the
police
acting
upon
an
inarticulate
hunch.
this
court
has
said
its
face
against
an
inarticulate
hunch
even
from
the
officer
in
nathanson.
and
from
that
point
on,
in
every
affidavit
case
this
court
has
ever
considered
this
case
amounts
to
more
than
an
inarticulate
hunch
after
an
interview,
that
someone
may
be
giving
reliable
information
about
a
person
who
mysteriously
has
been
known
to
be
in
the
business
of
trafficking
in
illegal
alcohol
for
four
years
but
about
whom
no
better
information
appears
to
have
been
obtained.
and
whom
--
in
relation
to
whom
maybe
some
difficulty
in
making
any
buy
at
all
to
confirm
that
he’s
in
fact
engaged
in
that
traffic.
under
these
circumstances,
i
suggest
that
an
affirmance
of
the
sixth
circuit's
decision
would
do
nothing
to
impair
effective
law
enforcement
and
a
reversal
would
do
enormous
damage
to
the
protections
of
the
fourth
amendment
that
this
court
has
zealously
guarded
over
the
years.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
it’s
a
pleasure
to
do
so,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
search
that
took
place
here
in
the
circumstances
that
gave
rise
to
it,
took
place
in
middlesborough,
kentucky
and
a
little
shack
alleged
to
have
contain
alcohol
on
which
the
tax
was
not
paid.
but
in
fact,
the
circumstances
--
pardon?
mr.
steven
m.
umin
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
it
was.
it’s
on
dansbury
avenue
in
middlesborough.
now,
i’ve
seen
pictures
of
the
place
which
are
in
the
record
to
what
extent
middlesborough
was
a
big
city
or
not
is
something
i’m
not
familiar
with
your
honor.
the
circumstances
however
are
paralleled
by
similar
circumstances
in
every
metropolitan
area
and
indeed
now
suburban
areas
that
i’m
sure
this
court
is
all
too
familiar
with.
the
circumstance
in
which
a
law
enforcement
officer
familiar
with
some
reputation
of
a
particular
suspect
becomes
on
a
given
day
possessed
of
information
not
derived
from
his
own
observations,
but
from
the
say
so
of
the
layman
that
in
the
legal
stimulant
it's
harbored
in
a
given
house.
that
to
be
sure,
it
probably
happens
hundreds
of
times
a
day
in
metropolises
of
this
country
with
respect
to
narcotics.
the
decision
in
this
case
will
therefore
affect
those
cases
gravely
as
well
it
will,
the
pursuit
of
illegal
whiskey
in
the
back
woods.
i
think
we
can
say
on
this
record
that
this
is
a
case
in
which
an
officer
got
possession
of
information
from
someone,
not
another
law
enforcement
officer
and
not
from
his
own
observations
to
the
effect
that
there
was
an
illegal
stimulant
in
this
case,
non-tax
paid
whiskey
in
someone’s
premises.
the
record
doesn’t
show
a
number
of
things.
it
doesn’t
show
with
any
great
clarity
that
this
was
a
first
time
informant
or
indeed
even
someone
who
may
have
been
unreliable
in
the
past.
to
be
sure,
this
court
has
counseled
that
magistrates
interpret
search
warrants,
affidavits
for
search
warrants
in
the
light
of
common
sense.
the
government
here
we
have
common
sense
suggests,
first
that
prudent
means
reliable,
perhaps
not
credible
but
reliable.
and
secondly,
--
pardon?
mr.
steven
m.
umin
no,
it
certainly
wouldn’t,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
yes,
your
honor.
that
of
course
is
not
this
case,
although,
i
think
it
would
be
insufficient
under
this
court’s
standards
in
aguilar.
aguilar
was
precisely
that
sort
of
case.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
no,
i
certainly
would
not.
in
fact,
i
would
plan
to
assume
though
not
concede,
this
was
a
first
time
informant
for
purposes
of
the
argument
i
would
want
to
make.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
of
course
not,
your
honor.
there’s
nothing
in
this
record
to
suggest
that.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
i
wouldn’t
suggest
that
negates
it
but
particularly
in
the
informer
context,
it
may
well
bear
a
strong
inference
of
unreliability.
a
reliable
--
mr.
steven
m.
umin
in
the
informer
context
the
word
prudent
may
bear
a
strong
inference
of
unreliability.
a
prudent
narcotics
informer
may
well
be
one
who
makes
who
makes
educated
guesses
about
who
it
is
in
the
community
may
well
have
a
bottle
of
illegal
liquor
on
his
premises.
because
he’s
being
paid
for
the
number
of
people
he
actually
turns
up
having
seen
roosevelt
harris
at
a
party
say,
he,
at
which
illegal
liquor
was
served,
you
take
a
guess
that
roosevelt
harris
may
have
a
bottle
of
liquor
in
that
--
in
his
house.
it
may
be
perfectly
prudent
for
him
under
those
circumstances
to
suggest
to
an
officer
or
find
in
a
list
of
30
or
40
people
from
whom
search
warrants
maybe
obtained
that
one
such
person
is
roosevelt
harris.
now,
if
it
turns
up
that
in
29
cases,
the
liquor
is
in
fact
found,
the
informant
would
subsequently
become
reliable,
but
it’s
that
one
case
we’re
concerned
about
and
a
prudent
narcotics
or
liquor
informant
may
well
be
inclined
to
take
a
guess
just
on
the
chance
that
it
will
turn
up
reward
or
payment
or
whatever
it
is
encourages
him
to
continue
as
an
informant
something
that,
of
course,
this
record
says
absolutely
nothing
about.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
of
course,
in
the
jury
--
mr.
steven
m.
umin
it
indeed
would
but
in
the
jury
context,
there’s
a
fair
--
mr.
steven
m.
umin
no.
i
wouldn’t.
the
jury
may
have
a
right
to
--
mr.
steven
m.
umin
excuse
me.
i’m
sorry,
your
honor,
i
missed
that.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
no,
i
wouldn’t
suggest
that
the
magistrate
should
necessarily
presume
on
reliability
in
this
case.
i
suggest
simply
that
the
inference
of
reliability
knowing
what
is
known
about
narc
--
about
informants,
particularly
in
the
stimulant
context
is
not
compelling
at
all
from
the
word
prudence.
prudence
may
suggest
as
the
court
of
appeals
suggested
that
a
man
is
circumspect.
it
may
suggest
that
it
is
very
good
at
taking
educated
guesses
and
that
would
be
sensible
for
him
to
do
that.
i
don’t
suggest
that
unreliability
is
compelled
either.
but
that
the
inferences
are
equally
balanced
and
a
jury
could
well
begin
without
any
notion
of
what
prudence
meant
or
with
a
notion
that
it
meant
reliable
or
unreliable.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
certainly
--
mr.
steven
m.
umin
that
certainly
--
mr.
steven
m.
umin
that’s
the
point,
i
mean,
either
context
to
the
affidavit
and
the
context
of
informant
behavior
generally
lends
to
the
word
prudence
so
many
connotations
that
it’s
difficult
even
to
settle
on
a
meaning.
even
more
important
in
settling
a
meaning
is
coming
up
with
some
basis
for
a
magistrate
to
assess
whether
that
judgment
of
prudence
is
correct.
how
can
a
magistrate
know
what
the
word
prudent
means
in
an
affidavit?
what
it
implies
about
the
judgment
made
if
there
are
no
in
fact
circumstances
stated
in
the
affidavit
to
substantiate
the
meaning
of
prudence
in
this
context.
that
after
all
is
the
function
that
this
court
has
historically
attributed
to
the
magistrate.
the
check
before
the
search
upon
the
probability
that
the
search
is
warranted,
the
check
upon
a
judgment
that
a
man
is
reliable.
magistrate
in
this
case
would
have
to
first
define
prudent
in
a
way
that
would
allow
the
determination
of
the
liability
and
second,
speculating
in
the
dark
as
to
whether
this
man
was
properly
determined
to
be
reliable
or
prudent
or
whichever
was
settled
upon
by
the
officer
in
question.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
as
to
the
details,
your
honor,
i
think
there’s
very
little
you
can
attribute
to
that
in
this
context.
details
in
no
sense
resemble
the
details
in
draper
which
were
details
predictive
in
nature.
in
that
case,
it
could
be
said
that
when
details
given
by
an
informant
was
subsequently
confirmed
by
an
agent
and
after
all
they
had
a
chance
in
that
case
not
to
eventuate,
the
informant
became
more
credible
because
the
information
predicted
was
in
fact
confirmed
to
be
true.
and
indeed,
the
informant’s,
the
likelihood
that
the
informant
was
giving
personal
information
was
increased
by
the
nature
of
the
detail
in
draper.
there’s
virtually
no
real
detail
in
this
affidavit
at
all.
the
detail
given
pertains
to
the
relationship
among
buildings
on
a
given
--
in
a
given
residence
in
a
at
best
medium
size
town
publicly
observable
detail
that
suggests
no
particularly
intimacy
on
the
part
of
the
informant
or
any
particular
credibility.
indeed,
it
should
be
noted
that
as
to
that
detail,
the
investigator
in
this
case
didn’t
even
go
so
far
as
far
as
this
record
shows
to
confirm
that
before
applying
for
the
warrant.
so,
the
confirmation
aspect
of
draper
was
wholly
out
of
the
case
and
the
personal
observation
aspect
to
draper
is
likewise
not
here.
the
critical
point
is
though,
that
nothing
in
this
case,
as
decided
by
the
sixth
circuit
impairs
law
enforcement
at
all
or
certainly
not
to
any
degree
sufficient
to
outweigh
the
interest
of
the
individual
security.
that
after
all
is
the
test
under
the
fourth
amendment
is
a
search
reasonable.
reasonable
as
involved
balance
and
this
court
has
expressed
that
test
in
camara
and
terry
as
a
--
the
balancing
of
the
need
to
search
against
the
enormity
of
the
invasion.
in
this
case,
a
number
of
alternative
opportunities
were
presented
to
the
affiant
officer.
even
if
it
were
true,
that
a
buy
had
been
difficult
to
make
in
four
years,
a
fact
which
itself
would
undermine
it
seems
to
me
the
merit
of
the
--
of
the
notion
that
this
affidavit
created
probable
cause,
even
if
that
were
true,
that
wasn’t
the
only
technique
available.
such
a
buy
to
be
sure
would
be
constitutional
as
would
the
procedure
established
by
united
states
against
lewis
in
which
the
buy
is
not
made
by
the
informant
at
all,
but
by
a
government
agent
who
calls
the
premises
and
sees
whether
he
can
make
a
buy
there.
in
lewis,
the
government
agent
actually
went
to
the
premises
and
made
the
buy,
came
back
at
second
time,
made
another
buy
and
had
evidence
available
for
trial,
but
even
if
the
buy
were
not
possible,
in
the
course
of
the
conversation
as
mr.
justice
douglas
suggested
in
his
dissent
in
lewis,
in
the
course
of
the
conversation
about
the
buy,
the
homeowner
alleged
to
have
illegal
whiskey
on
his
premises
might
well
say
something
to
substantiate
probable
cause.
who
are
you?
i’ve
never
heard
you
before?
how
do
i
know
that
you’re
not
a
cop?
that
kind
of
conversation
with
a
government
agent
who
has
received
information
that
there
is
illegal
liquor
at
a
certain
place
might
well
and
i
would
suggest
in
many
instances
would
enhance
the
probable
cause
that
he
could
present
to
a
magistrate
in
an
affidavit.
so,
it’s
not
simply
the
question
of
whether
a
buy
was
available,
an
available
technique,
a
buy
by
the
informant
or
a
buy
by
the
government
agent
but
whether
other
investigative
techniques
in
this
case
such
a
mere
phone
call
would
not
have
in
fact
turn
up
enough
strongly
indicative
evidence
of
involvement
in
the
traffic
of
illegal
alcohol
as
to
warrant
a
proper
affidavit
in
this
case.
i
don’t
even
suggest
that
there
are
cases
in
which
that
kind
of
further
investigation
may
not
be
possible.
the
americans
for
law
enforcement
filing
an
amicus
curiae
brief
present
here
a
case,
in
which,
in
course
of
that
brief,
in
which
a
cash
register
is
stolen
from
a
grocery
store
and
the
cashier
in
the
grocery
store,
a
young
employee
some
days
later
observes
the
cash
register
in
somebody’s
house
and
here
is
the
owner
of
that
house
boosted
that
he
stole
it.
well,
that’s
not
a
situation
in
which
the
law
enforcement
can
make
a
buy
or
can
make
phone
calls
to
see
whether
they
can
make
a
buy.
and
so,
the
police
officer
in
the
real
life
case
posited
by
the
americans
for
law
enforcement
went
around
the
neighborhood,
asked
the
neighbors
of
the
informant,
“is
he
reliable?
is
he
credible?
what’s
his
reputation?”
checked
with
the
police,
to
see
whether
he
had
a
criminal
record
or
not?
checked
with
his
employer
to
see
whether
the
employee
would
have
any
motivation
in
that
case
to
lie
or
fabricate
or
distort
a
fact
that
just
as
strong
as
lying
in
the
formation
of
affidavit.
having
gone
through
that
process,
the
officer
could
at
least
present
in
an
affidavit
to
a
magistrate
the
notion
that
he
had
done
his
best
to
clear
the
reputation
of
this
informant
for
truth
and
veracity
in
that
environment.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
no,
your
honor.
it
certainly
wouldn’t.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
not
at
all,
your
honor.
i
don’t
believe
that’s
the
essence
of
my
claim.
first
of
all,
--
mr.
steven
m.
umin
certainly,
if
the
defense
has
done
an
ineffective
job
in
impeaching
the
credibility
of
that
witness,
an
opportunity
to
have
a
trial
but
not
before
the
magistrate,
now
that
conviction
can
stand,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
i
really
don’t
believe
that’s
implicit
in
the
argument.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
yes.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
that’s
certainly
true
and
even
in
such
a
circumstance
when
an
informant
is
named
in
an
affidavit,
one
of
the
functions
of
naming
an
affidavit
--
mr.
steven
m.
umin
no.
but
i
mean,
what
the
magistrate
has
in
that
case
is
the
power
to
call
the
informant
before
him
and
cross-examine
him.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
indeed,
the
very
opposite
is
true.
hearsay
is
permissible
in
a
warrant
affidavit
of
this
kind
and
it’s
for
that
very
reason
that
magistrates
in
this
court
have
insisted
upon
some
assessment
of
the
reliability
of
the
person
conveying
the
hearsay.
it’s
because
the
magistrate
will
be
satisfied
by
evidence
that
would
not
be
competent
in
trial,
that
you
want
at
least
some
assurance
that
the
person
conveying
the
hearsay
is
not
conveying
either
a
rumor
or
a
fabrication.
that
assurance
need
not
be
given
in
the
form
of
cross
examination.
it
need
not
be
given
in
the
form
of
disclosing
his
name
so
that
the
magistrate
can
call
him
before
him
and
cross-examine.
but
it
should
appear
in
the
affidavit
that
the
steps
that
it’s
reasonably
possible
for
law
enforcement
to
take
to
confirm
the
reliability
of
the
person
giving
the
hearsay,
have
been
taken
and
continued
to
substantiate
that
the
informant’s
credibility
stands
up.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
that
job
is
left
to
the
defendant,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
your
honor,
the
record
doesn’t
support
the
notion
that
there
was
an
affidavit
given
by
the
unknown
person
to
the
affiant.
it
supports
only
the
notion
that
a
verbal
statement
was
given
described
in
this
affidavit
as
sworn.
there
was
not
even
an
affidavit
from
this
informant.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
that’s
the
real
problem.
presumably,
the
government
relies
upon
to
the
extent
it
does
rely
upon
a
sworn
statement
which
to
some
extent
it
does
not.
the
effect
of
swearing
somebody
in
would
be
to
inhibit
the
chances
of
falsification
by
threatening
an
informant
with
perjury
or
prosecution
under
some
other
federal
false
statement
statute.
obviously,
that
the
function
of
inhibition
in
this
setting,
we
don’t
know
who
the
person
is
and
only
the
affiant
does
and
there’s
no
evidence
present
at
the
swearing
and
would
be
virtually
null.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
it
shows
some
effort
--
mr.
steven
m.
umin
certainly,
i
mean,
the
search
warrant
does
not
issue
as
a
price
for
effort.
it
does
issue
when
probable
cause
is
established
and
probable
cause
is
established
when
there’s
a
reasonable
basis
for
a
magistrate
to
infer
that
an
informant
is
credible.
merely
swearing
him
in
does
not
provide
a
reasonable
basis
in
these
circumstances
and
there
are
so
many
alternatives
available
to
an
affiant
in
this
circumstance,
without
disclosing
the
informant’s
name,
which
would
buttress
his
reliability.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
i
think
that
would
come
very
close
to
sufficiency.
the
magistrate
could
simply
then
call
for
it
and
see
if
he
wished
and
see
who
it
was.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
it
could
be
submitted
to
the
court
under
seal.
that
justification
would
be
very
weak
under
those
circumstances,
i
would
think,
for
the
court’s
knowledge
alone
and
from
that
point
on,
without
disclosure
to
the
rest
of
the
world.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
only
to
the
extent
that
the
affidavit
enabled
calling
the
informant
into
an
in-camera
session
altogether
would
it
go
to
the
informant’s
reliability,
your
honor.
in
any
event
of
course
that's
not
this
case,
there’s
no
affidavit
or
sworn
statement
here.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
yes,
for
whatever
that
may
mean
in
middlesborough,
kentucky
or
anywhere
else.
i
have
on
many
occasions
myself
certainly
have
sworn
on
the
stack
of
bibles
and
had
no
notion
to
time
that
i
was
threatened
with
perjury
or
threatened
with
anything
that
seriously
buttressed
of
my
reliability.
i
would
hope
that
at
all
times,
i’d
tell
the
truth
but
i
don’t
think
that
court
--
that
kind
of
assertion
which
is
on
this
record
the
swearing
may
well
have
been
does
much
to
buttress
anyone’s
reliability.
given
the
alternatives
that
are
available
to
law
enforcement,
in
a
circumstance
like
this,
involving
minimal
law
enforcement
impingement
and
indeed
alternatives
that
are
commonly
used
throughout
the
country,
the
suggestion
that
this
court
ought
to
put
its
(inaudible)
upon
a
confirmation
of
reliability
amounting
to
no
more
than
the
use
of
an
ambiguous
term
in
an
affidavit
is
a
suggestion
in
effect
that
this
court
can
sign
over
to
the
police,
the
security
of
persons
and
their
houses,
not
simply
the
security
of
persons
and
their
houses
in
the
discretion
of
the
police,
but
in
the
discretion
of
the
police
acting
upon
an
inarticulate
hunch.
this
court
has
said
its
face
against
an
inarticulate
hunch
even
from
the
officer
in
nathanson.
and
from
that
point
on,
in
every
affidavit
case
this
court
has
ever
considered
this
case
amounts
to
more
than
an
inarticulate
hunch
after
an
interview,
that
someone
may
be
giving
reliable
information
about
a
person
who
mysteriously
has
been
known
to
be
in
the
business
of
trafficking
in
illegal
alcohol
for
four
years
but
about
whom
no
better
information
appears
to
have
been
obtained.
and
whom
--
in
relation
to
whom
maybe
some
difficulty
in
making
any
buy
at
all
to
confirm
that
he’s
in
fact
engaged
in
that
traffic.
under
these
circumstances,
i
suggest
that
an
affirmance
of
the
sixth
circuit's
decision
would
do
nothing
to
impair
effective
law
enforcement
and
a
reversal
would
do
enormous
damage
to
the
protections
of
the
fourth
amendment
that
this
court
has
zealously
guarded
over
the
years.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
it’s
a
pleasure
to
do
so,
your
honor.
