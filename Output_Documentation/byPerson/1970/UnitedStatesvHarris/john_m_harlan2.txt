i
suppose
you
would
probably
say
that
if
an
informer
tells
people
that
the
liquor
is
in
a
certain
place
that
is
if
they
go
there
they'll
find
it,
they
go
there
and
they
find
it.
it
wouldn’t
be
easy
to
convince
you,
would
it,
that
the
informer
was
not
worthy
of
belief?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
they
don’t
have
to
try
that,
the
general
reputation
for
truth
and
veracity
of
all
the
witnesses
in
a
search
warrant
case,
do
they?
justice
john
m.
harlan
wouldn’t
it
be
to
go
out
get
some
witnesses
who
would
swear
to
the
magistrate
that
these
people
have
general
reputation
to
be
untruthful
in
telling
the
truth?
justice
john
m.

is
that
a
way
to
get
a
witness?
justice
john
m.

to
do
what?
justice

getting
away
from
the
lawsuit
and
prudent
for
a
moment,
what
significance
would
you
attribute
(a)
to
the
specificity
of
the
allegation
made
in
the
affidavit
as
to
what
the
informant
told
him?
and
second,
through
the
allegation
that
the
agent
himself
had
gone
to
the
extent
of
getting
the
informant
to
put
his
information
under
oath?
