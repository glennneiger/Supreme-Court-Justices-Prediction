suppose
the
case
went
up
the
trial
before
a
jury,
and
they
put
on
the
same
informant,
would
it
be
up
to
the
government
to
prove
that
he
had
a
good
character
for
truth
and
veracity?
justice
hugo

black
would
that
same
argument
not
apply,
if
the
man
was
on
the
trial
and
summoned
to
jury
and
jury
was
before
you
and
you
were
trying
his
guilt
and
innocence?
justice
hugo
l.

and
that
might
put
him
up
as
witness?
justice
hugo

black
well,
do
the
jury
have
a
right
to
assume,
he
was
a

the

it
would
in

getting

not
in
the
acts

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
question
again?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
trouble
with
your
argument
for
this
reason.
i
understand
you
to
agree
the
government
had
a
case
against
a
man
like
this
and
put
an
informer
on
the
stand.
he
testified,
yes,
he
saw
him
sell
the
liquor
and
the
jury
would
have
convicted
him.
the
judge
couldn’t
--
wouldn’t
be
called
on
to
set
that
aside,
would
it
necessarily?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
here
is
a
case
where
the
only
question
is
getting
up
some
evidence
and
it’s
not
against
so
much
of
the
state
as
to
guilt
or
the
innocence
of
the
party.
and
you’re
claiming
that
in
a
preliminary
proceeding
to
get
a
search
warrant,
the
evidence
must
be
stronger
than
the
evidence
to
convict
the
man
of
a
crime.
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn’t
it,
it
would
suppose
that
the
government
simply
put
this
informant
on
the
stand
and
it
did
not
put
on
any
evidence
to
show
that
he
was
truthful
and
trustworthy
in
the
community
and
the
jury
went
on
to
convict
him,
is
there
any
reason
why
that
shouldn’t
stand?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that’s
what
you’re
exacting
is
an
opportunity
--
is
getting
a
search
warrant,
a
higher
burden
on
the
government
than
would
be
imposed
on
to
convict
the
defendant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
one
thing,
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that’s
not
the
argument
you
are
making.
you’re
not
making,
you
don’t
grant
a
hearsay,
are
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
understood
that
there's
a
hearsay
rule
with
reference
to
trial,
i
didn’t
understand
that
there
is
any
well-established
hearsay
rule
in
connection
with
people
who
testified
to
get
the
search
warrant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
don’t
have
to
confirm
that
witness
when
he’s
before
the
grand
jury
trying
a
man
as
to
his
guilt
or
innocence?
