ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
and
it
presents
what
has
become
a
perennial
problem
of
the
kind
of
information
you
need
to
get
a
search
warrant
and
how
the
courts
and
magistrates
--
magistrates
and
the
court,
i
should
say,
should
interpret
them.
the
particular
aspect
of
the
question
which
this
case
presents
is
what
law
enforcement
officers
are
supposed
to
do
when
they
get
information
from
someone
who
has
not
given
information
in
the
past
and
who
is
unwilling
to
let
his
name
be
used,
but
who
nevertheless
gives
information
which
a
responsible
law
enforcement
officers
feels
he
cannot
ignore.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
oh,
we
don’t
know,
except
that
considering
–
there
are
many,
many
cases
in
which
reliability
is
placed
on
the
fact
that
this
--
i
have
now
received
information
from
an
informant
who
has
given
information
in
the
past.
it’s
hard
to
believe
that
if
he
had,
an
investigator
would
not
have
said
so.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
the
absence
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
pardon?
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes,
because
i
may
have
extremely
careless
operator,
i
don’t
know,
but
that
--
the
fact
is
that
if
one
goes
to
the
cases
since
--
particularly
since
spinelli,
but
since
mccray
against
illinois,
it
was
case
after
case
in
which
it’s
almost
a
formula.
i
have
received
information
from
an
informant
who
has
in
past
been
proved
reliable.
sometimes
with
the
added
statement
that
he
has
given
specific
information
about
the
instances,
but
it’s
hard
to
believe
that
of
particularly
a
federal
investigator
who
had
had
information
in
the
past
from
this
informant
would
not
have
so
stated.
if
in
fact
he
had
done
so,
and
certainly
at
least,
we
have
to
take
this
case
because
he
did
not
claim
to
have
had
information
in
the
past
is
representing
the
situation
of
an
informer
who
had
not
given
information
in
the
past.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
and
the
person,
yes.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
don’t
think
that’s
any
problem
here,
not
for
the
nature
of
the
affidavit.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
i
was
just
about
to
say
that
and
the
particular
problem
comes
here
in
relation
to
someone
who
has
some
connection
with
the
defendant
because
he
purchased
liquor
for
him.
but
the
problem
as
the
brief
amicus
in
this
case
shows
can
come
about
in
all
kinds
of
ways.
the
problem
of
the
first
informant
is
a
very
important
problem
in
law
enforcement
because
it
can
come
at
the
one
end
from
a
completely
responsible
eminent
citizen
who
happens
to
witness
a
crime.
it
can
come
from
ordinary
citizens
who
simply
feel
they
have
seen
something
that
causes
them
to
make
reports.
police
get
information
--
pardon?
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
your
honor,
i
think
in
context,
it
means
credible.
and
the
court
says,
you
pay
no
attention
to
it
at
all,
but
it
seems
to
me,
the
opinion
below
in
that
respect,
in
that
little
respect
is
an
example
of
how
not
read
search
warrants.
i
don’t
know
whether
that’s
a
local
colloquialism
or
not.
obviously,
this
is
not
a
mastery
of
decent
english
language
as
we
get
from.
i
have
received
information
from
a
person
who
fears
for
their
life
and
property
and
he
wouldn’t
get
an
a
in
english,
but
i
don’t
know
that
that’s
the
question.
i
think
when
it’s
read
in
context,
i
have
interviewed
this
person
and
found
him
to
be
prudent,
that
means,
i
found
him,
in
my
judgment,
he’s
somebody
whom
i
trust.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
the
credible.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
i
don’t
we
could
say
reliable.
i
think
he
is
saying,
i
offer
you
my
judgment
that
this
is
a
person
that
i
can
trust
and
that
gets
us
to
this
problem.
one
gets
information
from
person
who
has
not
given
information
in
the
past.
now,
the
one
thing
that’s
clear
about
his
affidavit,
on
page
4
of
the
government’s
brief,
is
that
the
informant
is
talking
from
personal
knowledge.
what
he
had
said
is
that
this
person
has
personal
knowledge,
and
i’m
quoting,
“of
and
has
purchased
illicit
whiskey
from
within
the
residence
described
for
a
period
of
more
than
two
years
and
most
recently,
within
the
past
two
weeks,
has
knowledge
of
a
person
who
purchased
illicit
whiskey
within
the
past
two
days
from
the
house,
has
personal
knowledge
that
the
illicit
whiskey
is
consumed
by
purchases
in
the
out
building
known
and
utilized
as
a
dance
hall
and
has
seen
roosevelt
harris
go
to
the
other
outbuilding
located
about
50
yards
from
the
residence
on
numerous
occasions
to
obtain
the
whiskey
for
this
person
and
other
persons.
so,
that
this
case
is
clearly
distinguishable
from
most
of
the
situations
that
have
come
before
this
court
where
we
do
not
know
the
basis
of
the
informants
--
not,
we
do,
it
is
personal
knowledge.
and
through
the
personal
knowledge
that’s
the
two
weeks
before
the
day,
but
that
this
is
not
stale
information
is
alleged
–
well,
i
think
would
appear
anyway
from
the
nature
of
the
business,
but
the
fact
that
he
knows,
apparently
the
informant
knows
somebody
who
bought
whiskey
two
days
before
the
date
of
the
affidavit.
i
take
it
the
only
importance
of
that
is
to
show
that
the
business
is
still
going
on,
not
just
a
presumption,
but
that
bit
of
information
adds
that.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that’s
right.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that’s
the
only
issue
in
the
case.
i
take
it
that
if
the
informer
had
given
his
own
information,
has
his
own
affidavit
by
name
and
it
would
not
be
hearsay,
it
would
be
his
own
affidavit,
there’s
no
question
that
a
search
warrant
could’ve
issued
on
that.
now,
the
question
is
should
it
be
different
when
the
informer
is
afraid
or
unwilling
or
for
some
reason
will
not
make
the
affidavit
to
the
magistrate,
but
is
willing
to
make
this
sworn
statement
to
the
investigator.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
now,
this
is
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no.
a
sworn
verbal
statement
is
what
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
what
it
says
is
--
has
given
under
a
sworn
a
verbal
statement
as
the
following
information.
but
let’s
assume
it’s
not
sworn,
i
think
that
is
not
the
issue.
the
informer
is
willing
to
give
specific
information,
but
is
unwilling
to
make
a
sworn
affidavit
to
be
presented
to
the
magistrate.
this
is
a
situation
which
does
arise,
it
is
frequent.
the
court
has
recognized
time
and
again
that
informers
who
must
reveal
themselves
will
not
talk.
so
that
this
is
a
practical
situation
which
law
enforcement
agencies
must
deal
with
and
the
question
is,
what
do
they
do
about
it?
now
my
opponent
says,
when
you
get
this
kind
of
information,
you
go
out
and
make
a
buy,
but
you
will
notice
that
the
affidavit
does
say
on
page
4,
that
roosevelt
harris
had
a
reputation
for
over
four
years
as
being
a
trafficker
and
with
this
period,
i
have
received
numerous
information
from
all
types
of
persons
as
to
his
activities.
constable
howard
johnson
located
a
sizable
stash
of
illicit
whiskey
in
an
abandoned
house
under
harris’
control
during
this
period
of
time,
reputation
evidence
and
so
on
but
the
fact
that
for
four
years,
they’ve
known
about
this
and
haven’t
been
able
to
make
a
buy.
it
suggests
to
me
that
it
isn’t
quite
that
simple.
there
isn’t
every
case
in
which
you
can
go
and
corroborate
an
informer’s
information
by
making
a
buy
or
equivalent
and
of
course,
there
are
many
situations
when
you
have
first
informers
where
that’s
impossible.
you
get
a
word
from
a
hotel
maid
that
there’s
a
gun
under
somebody’s
bed
and
he
maybe
gone
tomorrow.
this
is
something
one
has
to
act
on
and
or
you
get
a
word
from
an
accomplice
which
is
the
situation
in
several
recent
cases
that
the
diamond
that
we
stole
is
about
to
be
sold
to
mr.
x
down
the
street,
you
got
to
act.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
this
isn’t
that
kind
of
a
thing
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes,
but
in
the
period
of
four
years,
they
have
not
been
able
to
make
a
buy.
all
i’m
saying
is
that
they
have
not,
it
isn’t
that
simple
to
say,
“well,
go
out
and
make
a
buy
and
corroborate
the
informant.”
obviously,
for
some
reason,
this
is
not
an
easy
case.
this
has
not
been
an
easy
defendant.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
think
it
comes
that
--
city,
i
don’t
remember.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
right.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
don’t
know
the
reason.
now,
there
are
two
things
here.
i
know
nothing
more
about
this
case
that
appears
in
the
record.
there
are
two
things
here
that
appear
in
the
record.
one
that
they
had
this
information
over
four
years
and
acted
apparently
the
day
they
got
somebody
who
had
personal
knowledge
though
that
--
i
assume
they
haven’t
been
able
to
do
it
very
easily
before
and
the
other
thing
that
appears
is
that
the
statement
that
the
informer
says,
he
fears
for
his
life.
that’s
--
those
are
the
two
things
that
appear
in
the
record.
the
fact
is
however
that
there
are
again
lots
of
situations,
not
this
case
but
there
are
certainly
many
and
the
rules
have
to
be
considered
beyond
just
this
case
as
to
what
does
one
do
about
first
information
where
either
because
of
time
or
circumstances
corroboration,
you
can't
have
a
long
investigation
for
further
corroboration.
and
one
of
the
first
things
i
think
first
one
has
to
ask
oneself
when
you
got
to
this
question
is
what
would
be
the
motive
for
an
informant
to
lie.
i
understand
that
an
informant
might
have
a
motive.
it
seems
to
me
two
motives.
one
is
if
he’s
an
accomplice,
he
is
somebody
involved,
he’s
arrested,
he
wants
to
do
something
for
himself.
if
i
give
information
to
the
police,
maybe
they’ll
go
easy
and
the
other
is
grudge
against
a
particular
person.
neither
of
those,
it
seems
to
me
involves
a
motive
to
lie
particularly
in
relation
to
search
warrants.
because
you’re
not
going
to
accomplish
anything
for
the
police
and
therefore,
for
betterment
of
yourself
or
you’re
not
really
going
to
get
the
man
you
have
a
grudge
against
in
jail
if
you
send
the
police
out
on
goose
chase.
so,
the
informant
by
a
grudge
or
by
hoping
to
better
himself
has
a
motive
to
give
correct
information.
he
probably
wouldn’t
do
it
unless
he
had
some
motive
that
kind
of
assuming
he’s
not
the
good
citizen
but
the
person
involved
in
criminality
in
some
form
or
other.
but
i
have
been
trying
to
see
what
benefit
he
would
gain
for
himself
by
lying
and
i
frankly
have
not
been
able
to
think
of
any,
but
assuming
that
even
so,
we
need
some
determination
as
to
the
honesty
of
the
informant.
the
question
is
how
do
you
get
it
if
you
can’t
for
some
reason
have
a
further
investigation
or
a
further
surveillance
and
you
do
it
at
one
end
or
the
other?
either,
what
do
you
know
about
the
person
who
gives
the
information
or
what
do
you
know
about
the
person
informed
against?
now,
in
some
cases,
i
take
it,
not
this
one,
in
some
cases,
i
take
it
you
could
say,
i
have
received
information
from
a
respectable
citizen
who
had
absolutely
no
motive
to
lie
that
he
has
personal
knowledge
of
such
and
such
occurred.
it
seems
to
me,
something
a
magistrate
could
properly
give
a
weight
to
in
determining
whether
to
believe
an
informant
who
according
to
report
speaks
not
on
hearsay,
but
on
personal
knowledge.
now
one
just
has
to
bear
in
mind
in
that
situation,
that
the
more
you
describe
the
informant,
the
more
you
tend
to
identify
him.
if
you
say
--
if
an
investigator
says,
“i
got
this
information
from
a
hotel
maid
who
was
there
at
nine
o’
clock
in
the
morning
or
something
like
that,
it
isn’t
very
hard
for
anybody
who
wanted
to
find
out
who
that
hotel
maid
is.
nevertheless,
i
do
think,
that
in
some
situations,
an
investigator
could
probably
say,
i
have
received
report
from
a
citizen
who
had
absolutely
motive
by,
who’s
well
regarded
in
the
community.
the
investigator
here
did
about
or
i
guess
i
thought
he
could
do,
he
said,
i
have
interviewed
this
person,
received
a
statement
under
oath
and
i’m
giving
you
my
judgment
that
he’s
a
credible
person.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
did
he?
i
don’t
know,
your
honor.
it
doesn’t
appear
of
record.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes,
i
think
it
would.
i
think
that
these
are
all
nuances
that
we
have
to
consider.
i
think
that
--
i
think
it
would
be
more
specific
that
it
would
strengthen
this
affidavit
at
that
end
if
the
officer
said,
“this
man
gave
me
his
name
and
address
and
a
sworn
written
statement,”
leaving
to
that
here,
he
gave
them
a
sworn
oral
statement
that
he
would
not
identify
himself.
this
is
--
these
are
both
things
to
be
weighed
and
i
don’t
give
a
great
deal
of
weight
to
what
was
said
about
the
informant
here
because
there
isn’t
much.
it’s
just
that
you
do
have
the
judgment
of
the
officer
that
i
tell
you,
i
on
my
oath
tell
you
mr.
magistrate
that
this
is
a
credible
person.
now,
we’re
starting
a
system
of
permanent
magistrates,
who
are
upgrading
magistrates.
they
are
going
to
know
the
investigators
in
their
region.
it
seems
to
me
something
they
have
a
right
to
consider.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
said
they
are
going
to
know,
i
think
better
probably
than
commissioners
you
know,
certainly
in
the
ones
where
you
have
full
time
magistrates
are
going
to
know
the
character
of
the
investigators
who
regularly
come
before
them.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
and
it
seems
to
me,
that
this
is
something
you
have
a
right
to
consider.
whether
alone
it
would
swing
this,
i
don’t
have
to
decide.
i
don’t
have
to
ask
the
court
to
decide.
yes
mr.
justice.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes
but
the
question
is
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
the
information
might
be
from
neighbors
who
saw
people
come.
i
don’t
know
the
reason
but
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
this
is
the
one
that
was
willing
to
say,
i
have
personal
knowledge.
i
don’t
know
what
else
they
had.
unfortunately,
it
is
true
that
people
have
reputations.
i
guess,
in
much
bigger
crimes
than
this
mr.
justice,
there
are
a
lot
of
things
we
know
that
we
can’t
prove.
and
that
brings
me
to
the
second
and
what
i
think
is
the
more
important
part
of
how
do
you
believe
the
informant
in
this
case,
and
that
is
the
statement
if
we’ve
heard
about
this
man
for
four
years
and
we
found
--
and
once
we
found
whiskey
in
an
abandoned
house
under
his
control
and
i
at
least
in
the
situation
we
have
here
where
the
informants
speaks
from
personal
knowledge,
we’re
not
dealing
with
the
vague
informant
like
spinelli.
we’re
dealing
in
a
situation
here
where
the
informant
speaks
from
personal
knowledge
and
the
question
is
should
we
believe
him
or
not.
in
that
situation,
i
do
ask
this
court
to
modify
the
language
of
spinelli
to
the
effect
that
reputation
is
merely
a
matter
of
bold
suspicion
having
no
way
whatsoever.
this
court
said,
as
long
ago
was
164
united
states
that
good
reputation
can
make
the
difference
between
innocence
and
guilt
in
the
trial
of
the
case.
and
prior
decisions
of
the
court
have
said
that
reputation
is
something
you
can
consider
in
probable
cause
and
actually
in
the
trial
of
the
case.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
the
record
of
the
fact
that
defendant
there
had
a
reputation
as
a
gambler
was
“a
bold
and
an
illuminating
assertion
or
suspicion
that
is
entitled
to
know
way
in
appraising
the
validity
of
the
magistrate’s
decision
to
issue
a
warrant.
this
is
contrary
to
the
fact,
to
carroll,
to
brinegar,
to
jones,
to
(inaudible).
as
i
say,
it
is
contrary
to
the
old
edgington
case
about
good
character
and
really
we
keep
bad
reputation
out
of
the
trial
not
because
it’s
irrelevant,
but
because
too
much
weight
could
be
attacked
to
a
jury.
and
so
it
seems
to
me
that
at
least
in
a
situation
here,
as
i
say,
where
we’re
dealing
with
an
informer
who
speaks
from
personal
knowledge,
certainly
at
least
in
that
situation
and
the
question
is
merely,
can
we
act
on
this
personal
knowledge
even
though
we
don’t
know
this
man,
we
haven’t
dealt
with
him
before.
you
consider
the
fact
that
the
person
he
is
informing
against
has
been
the
subject
of
a
lot
of
suspicion
and
not
even,
if
i
have
to
narrow
it
beyond
that,
i
guess,
it’s
particularly
true
in
fields
like
liquor
and
narcotics
where
reputations
are
generally
have
some
backing,
that
it’s
certainly
it
is
true
that
it
is
possible
for
somebody
have
the
name
without
the
game.
but
it
is
extremely
unlikely
with
relation
to
premises
where
liquor
is
sold
and
therefore,
when
you
get
as
i
say
not
a
vague
kind
of
suspicion,
not
of
tip,
but
an
informant
who
at
least
to
the
officer
is
willing
to
make
his
statements
under
oath,
then
it
seems
to
me
whether
you
--
and
issue
is
as
mr.
justice
white
said
at
the
begin,
do
you
believe
your
informant?
you
have
the
fact
which
is
what
this
case
presents.
in
fact,
that
as
far
as
i
can
see,
he
would
not
have
motive
to
lie
even
if
--
it’s
assumed
that
he
got
into
trouble
when
he
talked
to
the
police.
it
would
still
do
him
no
good
unless
the
information
he
gave
was
reasonable
--
it
turned
out
to
be
wrong.
if
he
sends
the
police
on
a
wild
goose
chase
that
doesn’t
help
him.
secondly,
the
officer
is
willing
to
swear
that
he
has
examined
the
man
and
found
him
a
credible
person
and
thirdly,
the
person
informed
against
is
someone
who
has
had
his
general
reputation
and
i
take
it,
they
were
trying
to
get
and
could
not
really
get
a
way
of
checking
the
information.
now,
let’s
not
forget
that
this
isn’t
guilt
or
innocence.
this
is
simply
a
presentation
to
the
magistrate
for
authority
to
go
in
and
look
in
the
premises
and
to
see
whether
this
reputation
and
the
informant’s
information
together
are
accurate
whether
there
are,
is
in
fact,
illegal
whiskey
concealed
here.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
that
is
true,
your
honor
but
the
fact
remains
that
they
didn’t
find
the
whiskey
that’s
the
end
of
the
government.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no.
the
fact
that
you
find
it
doesn’t
validate
the
warrant.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
even
if
we
assume
that
this
informer
had
some
motive
which
might
conceivably
--
have
some
reason
why
he
was
willing
to
talk
to
the
police
when
apparently
a
lot
of
people
weren’t.
the
fact
is
that
he
would
have
no
motivation
to
give
false
information.
it’s
about
--
there’s
everything
to
gained
by
giving
accurate
information,
if
he
hopes
to
gain
anything
than
by
giving
false
information.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no.
but
unfortunately,
the
magistrate
who
has
issued
the
warrant,
i
guess
doesn’t
have
that.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
no
your
honor.
i
take
it
and
i
think
there’s
no
question
that
if
this
informant
had
given
an
affidavit,
this
case
would
be
here.
the
point
is
that
you
do
deal
with
the
man
who
was
unwilling
to
give
his
name
to
the
magistrate
and
the
question
is,
how
much
more
in
the
face
of
that?
what
do
we
need
to
corroborate?
and
i
say,
that
this
corroboration
can
come
in
different
ways.
i
take
it
if
you
could
really
say
to
the
magistrate
this
information
comes
to
me
from
the
leading
citizen
of
the
town,
who
has
absolutely
no
motive
to
falsify.
then,
it
wouldn’t
matter
whether
the
person
informed
against
had
a
reputation
or
not.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
it
might
your
honor
because
as
i
take
it
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
it
gets
so
complicated
because
if
there
is
a
motive,
if
there
is
a
real
interest
in
keeping
the
identity
of
the
informer
secret
and
this
court
has
recognized
that
time
and
again
then
you
can’t
get
people
to
switch
to
his
reliability
because
that
refutes
it
immediately.
there
is
a
real
movement
on
in
in
this
country
to
upgrade
the
police
investigation.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
upgrade.
but
it
seems
to
me
in
relation
to
this
matter
of
warrants
that
those
who
must
deal
with
the
police
and
sort
of
train
them,
must
make
them
understand
what
this
is
about.
now,
i
think
it
is
possible
to
make
investigatory
or
law
enforcement
agencies
generally
understand
that
you
can’t
barge
in
within
a
warrant,
that
you
can’t
barge
in
on
just
reputation
because
that’s
not
enough.
i’m
not
disputing
that
the
police
sometimes
find
this
very
exasperating
and
you
know,
they
want
to
act
in
a
hurry
but
i
think
these
are
principles
that
can’t
be
explained
and
understood.
but
i
think
that
if
we
try
to
lay
down
rules
that
are
contrary
to
normal
experience
of
law
enforcement
officers
then
law
becomes
to
them
something
sort
of
art
and
a
series
of
rigid
rules
that
they
don’t
understand.
and
i
truthfully
believe
when
you
said
to
say
to
a
law
--
a
liquor,
alcohol
and
tax
investigating
officer
that
when
he
gets
an
informant,
the
fact
that
he’s
sort
of
heard
rumors
about
this
place,
let's
put
it
as
vague
as
that,
for
four
years
it's
something
that’s
entitled
--
to
no
vague
whatsoever.
it’s
just
contrary
to
like
as
he
understands
it
and
something
that’s
going
to
make
--
that
becomes
a
rule
that
to
him
does
not
in
accord
with
experience.
and
i
think
that
it
is
in
the
long
run
to
the
interest
of
good
law
enforcement
that
we
uphold
reasonable
judgments
and
i
think
in
this
case,
where
the
officer
had
information
on
personal
knowledge,
which
he
thought
came
from
a
credible
person.
but
which
also
coincided
with
a
lot
of
other
unspecific
information
that
he
had
been
acquiring
over
four
years.
it
was
proper
for
him
to
ask
for
search
warrant
and
proper
for
the
magistrate
to
give
it.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
and
it
presents
what
has
become
a
perennial
problem
of
the
kind
of
information
you
need
to
get
a
search
warrant
and
how
the
courts
and
magistrates
--
magistrates
and
the
court,
i
should
say,
should
interpret
them.
the
particular
aspect
of
the
question
which
this
case
presents
is
what
law
enforcement
officers
are
supposed
to
do
when
they
get
information
from
someone
who
has
not
given
information
in
the
past
and
who
is
unwilling
to
let
his
name
be
used,
but
who
nevertheless
gives
information
which
a
responsible
law
enforcement
officers
feels
he
cannot
ignore.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
oh,
we
don’t
know,
except
that
considering
–
there
are
many,
many
cases
in
which
reliability
is
placed
on
the
fact
that
this
--
i
have
now
received
information
from
an
informant
who
has
given
information
in
the
past.
it’s
hard
to
believe
that
if
he
had,
an
investigator
would
not
have
said
so.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
the
absence
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
pardon?
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes,
because
i
may
have
extremely
careless
operator,
i
don’t
know,
but
that
--
the
fact
is
that
if
one
goes
to
the
cases
since
--
particularly
since
spinelli,
but
since
mccray
against
illinois,
it
was
case
after
case
in
which
it’s
almost
a
formula.
i
have
received
information
from
an
informant
who
has
in
past
been
proved
reliable.
sometimes
with
the
added
statement
that
he
has
given
specific
information
about
the
instances,
but
it’s
hard
to
believe
that
of
particularly
a
federal
investigator
who
had
had
information
in
the
past
from
this
informant
would
not
have
so
stated.
if
in
fact
he
had
done
so,
and
certainly
at
least,
we
have
to
take
this
case
because
he
did
not
claim
to
have
had
information
in
the
past
is
representing
the
situation
of
an
informer
who
had
not
given
information
in
the
past.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
and
the
person,
yes.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
don’t
think
that’s
any
problem
here,
not
for
the
nature
of
the
affidavit.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
i
was
just
about
to
say
that
and
the
particular
problem
comes
here
in
relation
to
someone
who
has
some
connection
with
the
defendant
because
he
purchased
liquor
for
him.
but
the
problem
as
the
brief
amicus
in
this
case
shows
can
come
about
in
all
kinds
of
ways.
the
problem
of
the
first
informant
is
a
very
important
problem
in
law
enforcement
because
it
can
come
at
the
one
end
from
a
completely
responsible
eminent
citizen
who
happens
to
witness
a
crime.
it
can
come
from
ordinary
citizens
who
simply
feel
they
have
seen
something
that
causes
them
to
make
reports.
police
get
information
--
pardon?
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
your
honor,
i
think
in
context,
it
means
credible.
and
the
court
says,
you
pay
no
attention
to
it
at
all,
but
it
seems
to
me,
the
opinion
below
in
that
respect,
in
that
little
respect
is
an
example
of
how
not
read
search
warrants.
i
don’t
know
whether
that’s
a
local
colloquialism
or
not.
obviously,
this
is
not
a
mastery
of
decent
english
language
as
we
get
from.
i
have
received
information
from
a
person
who
fears
for
their
life
and
property
and
he
wouldn’t
get
an
a
in
english,
but
i
don’t
know
that
that’s
the
question.
i
think
when
it’s
read
in
context,
i
have
interviewed
this
person
and
found
him
to
be
prudent,
that
means,
i
found
him,
in
my
judgment,
he’s
somebody
whom
i
trust.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
the
credible.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
i
don’t
we
could
say
reliable.
i
think
he
is
saying,
i
offer
you
my
judgment
that
this
is
a
person
that
i
can
trust
and
that
gets
us
to
this
problem.
one
gets
information
from
person
who
has
not
given
information
in
the
past.
now,
the
one
thing
that’s
clear
about
his
affidavit,
on
page
4
of
the
government’s
brief,
is
that
the
informant
is
talking
from
personal
knowledge.
what
he
had
said
is
that
this
person
has
personal
knowledge,
and
i’m
quoting,
“of
and
has
purchased
illicit
whiskey
from
within
the
residence
described
for
a
period
of
more
than
two
years
and
most
recently,
within
the
past
two
weeks,
has
knowledge
of
a
person
who
purchased
illicit
whiskey
within
the
past
two
days
from
the
house,
has
personal
knowledge
that
the
illicit
whiskey
is
consumed
by
purchases
in
the
out
building
known
and
utilized
as
a
dance
hall
and
has
seen
roosevelt
harris
go
to
the
other
outbuilding
located
about
50
yards
from
the
residence
on
numerous
occasions
to
obtain
the
whiskey
for
this
person
and
other
persons.
so,
that
this
case
is
clearly
distinguishable
from
most
of
the
situations
that
have
come
before
this
court
where
we
do
not
know
the
basis
of
the
informants
--
not,
we
do,
it
is
personal
knowledge.
and
through
the
personal
knowledge
that’s
the
two
weeks
before
the
day,
but
that
this
is
not
stale
information
is
alleged
–
well,
i
think
would
appear
anyway
from
the
nature
of
the
business,
but
the
fact
that
he
knows,
apparently
the
informant
knows
somebody
who
bought
whiskey
two
days
before
the
date
of
the
affidavit.
i
take
it
the
only
importance
of
that
is
to
show
that
the
business
is
still
going
on,
not
just
a
presumption,
but
that
bit
of
information
adds
that.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that’s
right.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that’s
the
only
issue
in
the
case.
i
take
it
that
if
the
informer
had
given
his
own
information,
has
his
own
affidavit
by
name
and
it
would
not
be
hearsay,
it
would
be
his
own
affidavit,
there’s
no
question
that
a
search
warrant
could’ve
issued
on
that.
now,
the
question
is
should
it
be
different
when
the
informer
is
afraid
or
unwilling
or
for
some
reason
will
not
make
the
affidavit
to
the
magistrate,
but
is
willing
to
make
this
sworn
statement
to
the
investigator.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
now,
this
is
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no.
a
sworn
verbal
statement
is
what
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
what
it
says
is
--
has
given
under
a
sworn
a
verbal
statement
as
the
following
information.
but
let’s
assume
it’s
not
sworn,
i
think
that
is
not
the
issue.
the
informer
is
willing
to
give
specific
information,
but
is
unwilling
to
make
a
sworn
affidavit
to
be
presented
to
the
magistrate.
this
is
a
situation
which
does
arise,
it
is
frequent.
the
court
has
recognized
time
and
again
that
informers
who
must
reveal
themselves
will
not
talk.
so
that
this
is
a
practical
situation
which
law
enforcement
agencies
must
deal
with
and
the
question
is,
what
do
they
do
about
it?
now
my
opponent
says,
when
you
get
this
kind
of
information,
you
go
out
and
make
a
buy,
but
you
will
notice
that
the
affidavit
does
say
on
page
4,
that
roosevelt
harris
had
a
reputation
for
over
four
years
as
being
a
trafficker
and
with
this
period,
i
have
received
numerous
information
from
all
types
of
persons
as
to
his
activities.
constable
howard
johnson
located
a
sizable
stash
of
illicit
whiskey
in
an
abandoned
house
under
harris’
control
during
this
period
of
time,
reputation
evidence
and
so
on
but
the
fact
that
for
four
years,
they’ve
known
about
this
and
haven’t
been
able
to
make
a
buy.
it
suggests
to
me
that
it
isn’t
quite
that
simple.
there
isn’t
every
case
in
which
you
can
go
and
corroborate
an
informer’s
information
by
making
a
buy
or
equivalent
and
of
course,
there
are
many
situations
when
you
have
first
informers
where
that’s
impossible.
you
get
a
word
from
a
hotel
maid
that
there’s
a
gun
under
somebody’s
bed
and
he
maybe
gone
tomorrow.
this
is
something
one
has
to
act
on
and
or
you
get
a
word
from
an
accomplice
which
is
the
situation
in
several
recent
cases
that
the
diamond
that
we
stole
is
about
to
be
sold
to
mr.
x
down
the
street,
you
got
to
act.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
this
isn’t
that
kind
of
a
thing
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes,
but
in
the
period
of
four
years,
they
have
not
been
able
to
make
a
buy.
all
i’m
saying
is
that
they
have
not,
it
isn’t
that
simple
to
say,
“well,
go
out
and
make
a
buy
and
corroborate
the
informant.”
obviously,
for
some
reason,
this
is
not
an
easy
case.
this
has
not
been
an
easy
defendant.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
think
it
comes
that
--
city,
i
don’t
remember.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
right.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
don’t
know
the
reason.
now,
there
are
two
things
here.
i
know
nothing
more
about
this
case
that
appears
in
the
record.
there
are
two
things
here
that
appear
in
the
record.
one
that
they
had
this
information
over
four
years
and
acted
apparently
the
day
they
got
somebody
who
had
personal
knowledge
though
that
--
i
assume
they
haven’t
been
able
to
do
it
very
easily
before
and
the
other
thing
that
appears
is
that
the
statement
that
the
informer
says,
he
fears
for
his
life.
that’s
--
those
are
the
two
things
that
appear
in
the
record.
the
fact
is
however
that
there
are
again
lots
of
situations,
not
this
case
but
there
are
certainly
many
and
the
rules
have
to
be
considered
beyond
just
this
case
as
to
what
does
one
do
about
first
information
where
either
because
of
time
or
circumstances
corroboration,
you
can't
have
a
long
investigation
for
further
corroboration.
and
one
of
the
first
things
i
think
first
one
has
to
ask
oneself
when
you
got
to
this
question
is
what
would
be
the
motive
for
an
informant
to
lie.
i
understand
that
an
informant
might
have
a
motive.
it
seems
to
me
two
motives.
one
is
if
he’s
an
accomplice,
he
is
somebody
involved,
he’s
arrested,
he
wants
to
do
something
for
himself.
if
i
give
information
to
the
police,
maybe
they’ll
go
easy
and
the
other
is
grudge
against
a
particular
person.
neither
of
those,
it
seems
to
me
involves
a
motive
to
lie
particularly
in
relation
to
search
warrants.
because
you’re
not
going
to
accomplish
anything
for
the
police
and
therefore,
for
betterment
of
yourself
or
you’re
not
really
going
to
get
the
man
you
have
a
grudge
against
in
jail
if
you
send
the
police
out
on
goose
chase.
so,
the
informant
by
a
grudge
or
by
hoping
to
better
himself
has
a
motive
to
give
correct
information.
he
probably
wouldn’t
do
it
unless
he
had
some
motive
that
kind
of
assuming
he’s
not
the
good
citizen
but
the
person
involved
in
criminality
in
some
form
or
other.
but
i
have
been
trying
to
see
what
benefit
he
would
gain
for
himself
by
lying
and
i
frankly
have
not
been
able
to
think
of
any,
but
assuming
that
even
so,
we
need
some
determination
as
to
the
honesty
of
the
informant.
the
question
is
how
do
you
get
it
if
you
can’t
for
some
reason
have
a
further
investigation
or
a
further
surveillance
and
you
do
it
at
one
end
or
the
other?
either,
what
do
you
know
about
the
person
who
gives
the
information
or
what
do
you
know
about
the
person
informed
against?
now,
in
some
cases,
i
take
it,
not
this
one,
in
some
cases,
i
take
it
you
could
say,
i
have
received
information
from
a
respectable
citizen
who
had
absolutely
no
motive
to
lie
that
he
has
personal
knowledge
of
such
and
such
occurred.
it
seems
to
me,
something
a
magistrate
could
properly
give
a
weight
to
in
determining
whether
to
believe
an
informant
who
according
to
report
speaks
not
on
hearsay,
but
on
personal
knowledge.
now
one
just
has
to
bear
in
mind
in
that
situation,
that
the
more
you
describe
the
informant,
the
more
you
tend
to
identify
him.
if
you
say
--
if
an
investigator
says,
“i
got
this
information
from
a
hotel
maid
who
was
there
at
nine
o’
clock
in
the
morning
or
something
like
that,
it
isn’t
very
hard
for
anybody
who
wanted
to
find
out
who
that
hotel
maid
is.
nevertheless,
i
do
think,
that
in
some
situations,
an
investigator
could
probably
say,
i
have
received
report
from
a
citizen
who
had
absolutely
motive
by,
who’s
well
regarded
in
the
community.
the
investigator
here
did
about
or
i
guess
i
thought
he
could
do,
he
said,
i
have
interviewed
this
person,
received
a
statement
under
oath
and
i’m
giving
you
my
judgment
that
he’s
a
credible
person.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
did
he?
i
don’t
know,
your
honor.
it
doesn’t
appear
of
record.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes,
i
think
it
would.
i
think
that
these
are
all
nuances
that
we
have
to
consider.
i
think
that
--
i
think
it
would
be
more
specific
that
it
would
strengthen
this
affidavit
at
that
end
if
the
officer
said,
“this
man
gave
me
his
name
and
address
and
a
sworn
written
statement,”
leaving
to
that
here,
he
gave
them
a
sworn
oral
statement
that
he
would
not
identify
himself.
this
is
--
these
are
both
things
to
be
weighed
and
i
don’t
give
a
great
deal
of
weight
to
what
was
said
about
the
informant
here
because
there
isn’t
much.
it’s
just
that
you
do
have
the
judgment
of
the
officer
that
i
tell
you,
i
on
my
oath
tell
you
mr.
magistrate
that
this
is
a
credible
person.
now,
we’re
starting
a
system
of
permanent
magistrates,
who
are
upgrading
magistrates.
they
are
going
to
know
the
investigators
in
their
region.
it
seems
to
me
something
they
have
a
right
to
consider.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
said
they
are
going
to
know,
i
think
better
probably
than
commissioners
you
know,
certainly
in
the
ones
where
you
have
full
time
magistrates
are
going
to
know
the
character
of
the
investigators
who
regularly
come
before
them.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
and
it
seems
to
me,
that
this
is
something
you
have
a
right
to
consider.
whether
alone
it
would
swing
this,
i
don’t
have
to
decide.
i
don’t
have
to
ask
the
court
to
decide.
yes
mr.
justice.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes
but
the
question
is
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
the
information
might
be
from
neighbors
who
saw
people
come.
i
don’t
know
the
reason
but
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
this
is
the
one
that
was
willing
to
say,
i
have
personal
knowledge.
i
don’t
know
what
else
they
had.
unfortunately,
it
is
true
that
people
have
reputations.
i
guess,
in
much
bigger
crimes
than
this
mr.
justice,
there
are
a
lot
of
things
we
know
that
we
can’t
prove.
and
that
brings
me
to
the
second
and
what
i
think
is
the
more
important
part
of
how
do
you
believe
the
informant
in
this
case,
and
that
is
the
statement
if
we’ve
heard
about
this
man
for
four
years
and
we
found
--
and
once
we
found
whiskey
in
an
abandoned
house
under
his
control
and
i
at
least
in
the
situation
we
have
here
where
the
informants
speaks
from
personal
knowledge,
we’re
not
dealing
with
the
vague
informant
like
spinelli.
we’re
dealing
in
a
situation
here
where
the
informant
speaks
from
personal
knowledge
and
the
question
is
should
we
believe
him
or
not.
in
that
situation,
i
do
ask
this
court
to
modify
the
language
of
spinelli
to
the
effect
that
reputation
is
merely
a
matter
of
bold
suspicion
having
no
way
whatsoever.
this
court
said,
as
long
ago
was
164
united
states
that
good
reputation
can
make
the
difference
between
innocence
and
guilt
in
the
trial
of
the
case.
and
prior
decisions
of
the
court
have
said
that
reputation
is
something
you
can
consider
in
probable
cause
and
actually
in
the
trial
of
the
case.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
the
record
of
the
fact
that
defendant
there
had
a
reputation
as
a
gambler
was
“a
bold
and
an
illuminating
assertion
or
suspicion
that
is
entitled
to
know
way
in
appraising
the
validity
of
the
magistrate’s
decision
to
issue
a
warrant.
this
is
contrary
to
the
fact,
to
carroll,
to
brinegar,
to
jones,
to
(inaudible).
as
i
say,
it
is
contrary
to
the
old
edgington
case
about
good
character
and
really
we
keep
bad
reputation
out
of
the
trial
not
because
it’s
irrelevant,
but
because
too
much
weight
could
be
attacked
to
a
jury.
and
so
it
seems
to
me
that
at
least
in
a
situation
here,
as
i
say,
where
we’re
dealing
with
an
informer
who
speaks
from
personal
knowledge,
certainly
at
least
in
that
situation
and
the
question
is
merely,
can
we
act
on
this
personal
knowledge
even
though
we
don’t
know
this
man,
we
haven’t
dealt
with
him
before.
you
consider
the
fact
that
the
person
he
is
informing
against
has
been
the
subject
of
a
lot
of
suspicion
and
not
even,
if
i
have
to
narrow
it
beyond
that,
i
guess,
it’s
particularly
true
in
fields
like
liquor
and
narcotics
where
reputations
are
generally
have
some
backing,
that
it’s
certainly
it
is
true
that
it
is
possible
for
somebody
have
the
name
without
the
game.
but
it
is
extremely
unlikely
with
relation
to
premises
where
liquor
is
sold
and
therefore,
when
you
get
as
i
say
not
a
vague
kind
of
suspicion,
not
of
tip,
but
an
informant
who
at
least
to
the
officer
is
willing
to
make
his
statements
under
oath,
then
it
seems
to
me
whether
you
--
and
issue
is
as
mr.
justice
white
said
at
the
begin,
do
you
believe
your
informant?
you
have
the
fact
which
is
what
this
case
presents.
in
fact,
that
as
far
as
i
can
see,
he
would
not
have
motive
to
lie
even
if
--
it’s
assumed
that
he
got
into
trouble
when
he
talked
to
the
police.
it
would
still
do
him
no
good
unless
the
information
he
gave
was
reasonable
--
it
turned
out
to
be
wrong.
if
he
sends
the
police
on
a
wild
goose
chase
that
doesn’t
help
him.
secondly,
the
officer
is
willing
to
swear
that
he
has
examined
the
man
and
found
him
a
credible
person
and
thirdly,
the
person
informed
against
is
someone
who
has
had
his
general
reputation
and
i
take
it,
they
were
trying
to
get
and
could
not
really
get
a
way
of
checking
the
information.
now,
let’s
not
forget
that
this
isn’t
guilt
or
innocence.
this
is
simply
a
presentation
to
the
magistrate
for
authority
to
go
in
and
look
in
the
premises
and
to
see
whether
this
reputation
and
the
informant’s
information
together
are
accurate
whether
there
are,
is
in
fact,
illegal
whiskey
concealed
here.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
that
is
true,
your
honor
but
the
fact
remains
that
they
didn’t
find
the
whiskey
that’s
the
end
of
the
government.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no.
the
fact
that
you
find
it
doesn’t
validate
the
warrant.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
even
if
we
assume
that
this
informer
had
some
motive
which
might
conceivably
--
have
some
reason
why
he
was
willing
to
talk
to
the
police
when
apparently
a
lot
of
people
weren’t.
the
fact
is
that
he
would
have
no
motivation
to
give
false
information.
it’s
about
--
there’s
everything
to
gained
by
giving
accurate
information,
if
he
hopes
to
gain
anything
than
by
giving
false
information.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no.
but
unfortunately,
the
magistrate
who
has
issued
the
warrant,
i
guess
doesn’t
have
that.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
no
your
honor.
i
take
it
and
i
think
there’s
no
question
that
if
this
informant
had
given
an
affidavit,
this
case
would
be
here.
the
point
is
that
you
do
deal
with
the
man
who
was
unwilling
to
give
his
name
to
the
magistrate
and
the
question
is,
how
much
more
in
the
face
of
that?
what
do
we
need
to
corroborate?
and
i
say,
that
this
corroboration
can
come
in
different
ways.
i
take
it
if
you
could
really
say
to
the
magistrate
this
information
comes
to
me
from
the
leading
citizen
of
the
town,
who
has
absolutely
no
motive
to
falsify.
then,
it
wouldn’t
matter
whether
the
person
informed
against
had
a
reputation
or
not.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
it
might
your
honor
because
as
i
take
it
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
it
gets
so
complicated
because
if
there
is
a
motive,
if
there
is
a
real
interest
in
keeping
the
identity
of
the
informer
secret
and
this
court
has
recognized
that
time
and
again
then
you
can’t
get
people
to
switch
to
his
reliability
because
that
refutes
it
immediately.
there
is
a
real
movement
on
in
in
this
country
to
upgrade
the
police
investigation.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
upgrade.
but
it
seems
to
me
in
relation
to
this
matter
of
warrants
that
those
who
must
deal
with
the
police
and
sort
of
train
them,
must
make
them
understand
what
this
is
about.
now,
i
think
it
is
possible
to
make
investigatory
or
law
enforcement
agencies
generally
understand
that
you
can’t
barge
in
within
a
warrant,
that
you
can’t
barge
in
on
just
reputation
because
that’s
not
enough.
i’m
not
disputing
that
the
police
sometimes
find
this
very
exasperating
and
you
know,
they
want
to
act
in
a
hurry
but
i
think
these
are
principles
that
can’t
be
explained
and
understood.
but
i
think
that
if
we
try
to
lay
down
rules
that
are
contrary
to
normal
experience
of
law
enforcement
officers
then
law
becomes
to
them
something
sort
of
art
and
a
series
of
rigid
rules
that
they
don’t
understand.
and
i
truthfully
believe
when
you
said
to
say
to
a
law
--
a
liquor,
alcohol
and
tax
investigating
officer
that
when
he
gets
an
informant,
the
fact
that
he’s
sort
of
heard
rumors
about
this
place,
let's
put
it
as
vague
as
that,
for
four
years
it's
something
that’s
entitled
--
to
no
vague
whatsoever.
it’s
just
contrary
to
like
as
he
understands
it
and
something
that’s
going
to
make
--
that
becomes
a
rule
that
to
him
does
not
in
accord
with
experience.
and
i
think
that
it
is
in
the
long
run
to
the
interest
of
good
law
enforcement
that
we
uphold
reasonable
judgments
and
i
think
in
this
case,
where
the
officer
had
information
on
personal
knowledge,
which
he
thought
came
from
a
credible
person.
but
which
also
coincided
with
a
lot
of
other
unspecific
information
that
he
had
been
acquiring
over
four
years.
it
was
proper
for
him
to
ask
for
search
warrant
and
proper
for
the
magistrate
to
give
it.
