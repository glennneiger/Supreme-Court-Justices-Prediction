justice
potter
stewart
your
--
you
stated
the
issue
and
as
you
understand
it
and
submitted
to
the
court
today,
is
it
purely
a
question
of
a
statutory
construction
or
are
there
any
constitutional
questions?
justice
potter
stewart
you
don’t
question
the
power
of
congress
under
the
commerce
clause
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
to
enact
a
statute
that
could’ve
made
the
travel
by
the
gamblers
sufficient
to
make
your
clients
guilty
of
a
federal
criminal
offense?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
other
words,
if
we
disagree
with
you
as
to
the
statutory
construction,
it
could
be
involved.
we
could
say,
yes,
the
statute
as
we
read
it,
does
mean
that
the
travel
by
the
players
from
georgia
into
florida
is
sufficient
to
make
your
clients
guilty
of
a
defense
under
the
statutes
as
it’s
written,
then
there
it
becomes
the
question,
well,
could
congress
have
the
constitutional
power
under
commerce
clause
to
do
so.
you
don’t
go
though
that
far?
justice
potter
stewart
because
you
rest
your
argument
on
the
words
of
the
statute,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
my
posit
--
justice
potter
stewart
now
you
assume
it
could
have.
in
any
event
your
argument
is
based
exclusively
on
the
language
of
the
statute
and
its
legislative
history.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
purely
a
statutory
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
alright,
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
they
were
movies
introduced
to
notice?
justice
potter
stewart
of
the
activity
going
around
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
house
and
i
suppose
they
are
in
the
original
record
which
is
lodged
in
the
court,
are
they?
