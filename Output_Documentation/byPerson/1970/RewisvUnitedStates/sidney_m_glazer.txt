mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
there
is
sufficient
evidence
to
show
that
petitioner
has
caused
other
people
not
themselves
to
travel
in
interstate
commerce
with
intent
to
promote
their
gambling
establishment,
whether
the
people
who
traveled
were
runners
or
customers.
the
issue
as
we
see
it
while
involves
the
construction
of
18
u.s.c.
1952
and
also
18
u.s.c
2
turns
in
large
part
on
the
facts.
now,
let
me
just
resay
--
restate
some
of
the
salient
facts.
it
is
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
we’ve
--
we
construe
the
indictment
as
charging,
traveling
in
interstate
commerce
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
and
causing
travel.
correct.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
read
the
statute
as
--
has
construed
the
statute
as
meaning
that
when
you
travel.
when
you
travel
or
cause
travel,
that
includes
the
use
of
interstate
facilities.
in
other
words,
i
think
they
have
used,
considered
the
term
travel
to
embrace
the
use
of
interstate
facilities.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right,
in
other
words,
they
consider
that
the
word
“travel”
embraces
the
use
of
interstate
facility
such
as
interstate
roads.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right.
using
the
telephone.
i
think
the
--
if
you
go
in
the
history
of
the
statute,
i
think
the
history
shows
that
the
use
of
interstate
facilities
was
added
to
the
bill
after
it
was
initially
introduced
to
broaden
the
bill
and
to
cover
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right.
right,
that’s
correct.
as
i
recall,
the
initial
was
just
a
travel
bill
and
then
on
the
--
either
one
of
the
committees
at
the
senate
house
committee
added
the
use
of
interstate
facilities
to
the
bill
as
introduced
by
the
department
of
justice.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
it
--
if
--
let
me
just
go
to
the
facts
and
i
think
if
i
answer
the
fact,
relate
the
facts,
i
think
it
comes
a
little
easier
to
answer
that
question
and
answer
in
the
abstract.
now,
the
business
that
was
operated
in
this
case
was
operated
in
a
private
home
of
petitioner
williams.
it
wasn’t
a
--
it
was
a
private
home
in
a
small
town
and
cluster
of
five
private
homes.
in
other
words,
it
--
the
location
was
such
that
an
interstate
traveler
wouldn’t
just
go
there
by
happenstance.
a
person
would
only
be
able
to
go
to
the
williams
house
and
enter
the
williams
house
for
gambling
purposes
if
he
in
fact
knew
gambling
was
going
on
there
and
if
in
fact,
if
the
people
knew
that
he
was
the
type
of
person
who
they
would
let
in.
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
--
there’s
a
little
misconception
in
this
case.
there
wasn’t
a
whole
group
of
people
who
went
to
the
williams
house
on
the
saturday
mornings
in
which
the
travel
occurred.
there
were
just
a
small
group
of
people
who
traveled
each
saturday
and
as
generally
the
same
eight
or
nine
people
who
traveled
and
the
evidence
showed
that
the
people
who
traveled
were
repeaters.
in
other
words,
the
same
people
would
come
each
week
and
some
of
the
people
--
some
of
the
people
who
came,
the
evidence
showed,
they
didn’t
just
go
and
buy
a
ticket
in
the
williams
house,
they
came
with
a
water
paper
and
with
money
and
the
evidence
shows
that
at
least
one
of
them
put
the
money
in
their
cigar
box
and
cigar
box
was
the
place
for
the
lottery
tickets
and
the
money
were
kept.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
williams
house
was
near
a
state
highway.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
what
would
you
say?
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
highway
--
state
highway
200
or
state
highway
a1-a
which
was
two
blocks
from
the
center
of
the
town
and
the
center
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yulee.
yulee,
florida
which
was
on
interstate
17
and
most
of
the
people
who
came
from
georgia.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
this
goes
on
jacksonville,
i
believe.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
don’t
know
where
it
started.
and
most
of
the
people
who
came
from
georgia
came
down
interstate
70
--
interstate
17
and
turned
on
highway
200
and
then
there’s
a
little
access
road
near
the
williams
house
and
they
drove
up
to
the
williams
house
and
stayed
a
very
short
time.
they
would
stay
about
15
minutes
and
then
they
would
leave.
now,
that
in
itself
is
significant.
the
lottery
itself
--
the
lottery
itself
--
the
winner
of
the
lottery
wasn’t
determined
until
two
o’clock
but
this
people
would
come
there
on
saturday
morning,
stay
about
15
minutes
and
leave.
now,
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right.
it
was
--
in
other
words,
their
journey
would
--
they
were
just
--
they
would
cross
the
georgia
border
into
florida
and
mainly
stay
at
the
house
for
a
short
time
and
turn
around
and
come
right
back
into
georgia.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
there
was
evidence
--
there
was
evidence
by
a
person
who
worked
in
the
house
that
on
occasion
--
she
would
--
she
said
she
sold
tickets
to
people
that
came
to
the
house
and
she
also
said
that
some
of
the
people
who
came,
these
people
who
were
the
court
of
appeals
found
were
gamblers
and
not
runners.
she
testified
that
those
two
people
when
they
came
under
four
or
five
occasions,
they
didn’t
just
simply
buy
a
ticket
from
her
but
that
they
brought
a
water
paper
and
one
of
them
brought
--
just
brought
at
one
point
at
least
$80.00.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
no.
they
didn’t
come
with
tickets,
they
came
with
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
the
woman
who
said
she
sold
tickets,
in
essence,
said,
she
sold
them
a
number.
they
would
pick
a
number,
say
19
and
pay
an
amount,
say
from
50
cents
to
$5.00
and
if
at
2
o’clock
in
the
afternoon,
19
was
the
number
drawn
in
cuba,
then
you’d
win
60
times
what
you
bet.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
the
tickets
were
written
out
in
long
hand.
i
mean
there
was
no
written
ticket.
so,
there
were
somebody
who
would
say,
number
19
and
ticket
would
be
written
up.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
it
was
really
a
numbers
game,
a
numbers
game,
lottery
in
a
broad
sense,
but
specifically
a
numbers
game.
now,
the
evidence
we
submit
warrants
the
conclusion
that
petitioners
caused
the
travel
of
these
people
as
we
said
before,
you
just
couldn’t
stumble
upon
this
place.
you
had
to
know
when
to
come
on
the
saturday
morning
and
this
warrants
the
inference
that
there
was
prearrangement
that
the
people
came
because
they
arranged
with
the
operators
to
come.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
there’s
only
circumstantial
evidence.
there’s
no
direct
evidence
of
any
advertisement
that
anybody
said
in
georgia,
come
down
to
mrs.
williams’
house
in
florida
and
gamble.
no,
there’s
no
direct
evidence.
the
only
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
indirect
evidence
is
the
location
of
the
establishment.
the
fact
that
the
only
--
the
people
who
went
there
were
habitual
travelers.
that
the
people
who
went
there
were
few
in
number
or
wasn’t
--
just
anybody
couldn’t
go
and
the
fact
that
they
came
back
over
and
over
again,
so
you
can
warrant
the
inference
that
was
implied
invitation
to
come
again
and
there’s
also
the
fact
that
you
had
to
know
what
time
to
go
there.
in
other
words,
the
--
the
people
generally
came
on
a
short
period
of
saturday
morning,
had
to
get
there
before
noon.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
they
might
be
guilty.
i’d
say,
they
would
definitely
be
guilty
if
after
the
person
came
the
first
time,
they
in
essence
said
come
again.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
think
if
they
could
foresee.
i
think
that’s
a
more
difficult
problem
than
you
have
to
reach
in
this
case.
if
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no.
no,
i’m
going
to
answer.
i
would
say,
yes.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
if
a
person
from
georgia
came
to
this
gambling
establishment
and
the
operators
didn’t
know
that
this
particular
person
came
from
georgia,
i
would
say
they
wouldn’t
violate
the
statute,
but
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
he
would
take
a
risk.
he
would
take
a
risk,
if
he
took
the
georgia
money,
the
georgia
better.
however,
i
don’t
think
that’s
this
case.
i
think,
this
case,
the
circumstances
are
such
to
make
it
come
within
18
u.s.c.
2
(b)
which
makes
a
--
makes
it
a,
makes
a
person
criminally
liable
when
he
causes
an
act
to
be
done
which
if
directly
performed
by
him
would
be
a
federal
offense.
in
other
words,
18
u.s.c.
2
(b)
was
added
in
1948
to
the
criminal
code
to
permit
deletion
of
cause
or
procurer
from
the
other
criminal
statutes
and
the
reviser’s
note
makes
clear
that
the
purpose,
the
purpose
of
this
provision
was
to
make,
remove
all
doubt
that
when
a
person
causes
the
commission
of
an
element
of
the
offense,
causes
an
innocent
person
to
commit
an
element
the
offense,
that
constitutes
a
violation.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right.
right
if
he
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right.
in
other
words,
the
easiest
illustration,
the
easiest
illustration
of
how
you
can
cause
somebody
to
come
would
be
a
situation
where
there
would
be
a
direct
--
suppose
a
narcotics
case
then.
there
was
a
seller
down
in
florida
and
a
purchaser
in
georgia
and
they
made
specific
arrangements
for
one
person
for
the
georgia
citizen
to
travel
down
to
florida.
there
would
be
--
it
would
be
clear
that
by
the
prearrangement,
the
seller
was
causing,
causing
the
person
to
travel
in
interstate
commerce.
the
thing
becomes
complicated
because
generally
--
generally,
in
a
crime,
for
example,
this
statute
makes
it
a
crime
to
travel
in
interstate
commerce
to
commit
extortion.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
what?
right.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no.
he
--
the
statute
makes
it
a
crime
for
him
to
travel
--
travel
from
state
to
state
with
intent
to
commit
extortion.
if
for
example
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
in
the
heart
of
atlanta
motel,
well,
that
was
in
a
companion
case,
the
heart
of
atlanta
motel
case,
that
was
a
restaurant
involved
where
interstate
travelers
stopped
and
this
court
held
that
that
activity
was
in
affect
commerce
and
was
subject
to
federal
regulation.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right,
right,
right.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
this
is
--
this
is
an
eating
place.
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right
and
it’s
our
position
that
the
language
of
this
statute
and
its
history
shows
that
it
interacts
with
the
18
u.s.c.
2
and
if
for
example,
if
a
person
commits
extortion
and
by
committing
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right,
right.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
continuous
business
conducted
at
this
establishment
with
awareness
that
people
from
georgia
were
coming
that
the
same
people
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
yes
sir.
i
would
say
that
the
proof
did
show
that.
as
to
mrs.
williams,
she
was
related
to
one
of
the
individuals
that
traveled
and
the
other,
there
was
another,
there
were
two
williams
in
this
case,
and
one
williams,
charlotte
williams
was
a
close
friend
of
her,
so
she
was
aware
of
that.
as
far
as
rewis
is
concerned,
he
would
arrive
at
the
place
at
a
time
when
there
were
a
lot
--
when
the
car
is
parked
there
included
georgia
cars.
so,
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
and
under
18
u.s.c.
2,
three
or
four
courts
of
appeals
have
held
that
when
an
employer
of
a
gambling
operation
employs
individuals
who
live
in
another
state
and
these
individuals
travel
from
say
illinois
to
wisconsin
that
that
violates
the
statute.
i
would
assume
that
that
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes,
we
would
think
it
was
under
2
(a)
that
he
would
be
an
aider
or
abater.
in
other
words,
2
(a)
seems
to
apply
to
a
situation
where
all
the
parties
are
clearly
guilty
of
a
violation
whereas
2
(b)
applies
to
the
situation
where
the
jurisdictional
element
or
an
element
of
the
crime
maybe
committed
--
maybe
done
by
somebody
who
himself
may
not
be
guilty
of
an
offense.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right
that
is
correct.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right,
the
bass
case
and
the
zizzo
case
and
i
think
the
barrow
case.
now,
the
problem
of
causation
as
i
said
before,
when
--
if
you
have
an
extortion
where
the
extortion
--
extortionist
lives
in
one
state
and
he
extorts
money
from
somebody
in
the
other
state
and
in
the
course
of
the
extortion,
that
person
travels
interstate
commerce
or
uses
an
interstate
facility,
i
think
it’s
easy
to
see
that
the
fear
--
the
fear
induced
by
the
extortionist
causes
the
jurisdictional
element
which
completes
the
offense.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
we
don’t
think
they’re
innocent
as
far
as,
for
example
two
of
them,
fuller
and
nightingale,
it
was
a
government’s
position
that
they
were
employees
and
the
evidence
showed
that
they
didn’t
just
merely
cross
the
state
line
and
buy
a
ticket
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right,
they
were
indicted
and
--
they
were
indicted,
convicted
and
the
court
of
appeals
set
aside
the
conviction.
the
court
of
appeals
--
on
the
ground
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient
to
show
that
they
were
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
to
show
that
they
were
runners.
they
were
anything
more
than
mere
betters.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
i
don’t
think
the
evidence
--
i
don’t
think
the
evidence
was
$75.00
a
week.
the
evidence
showed
that
rewis
had
$1500.00
in
his
pocket
and
i
think
you
can
infer
from
the
evidence
that
this
is
just
one
of
the
places
that
rewis
stopped
at
and
in
the
court
--
and
there’s
also
evidence
he
had
--
in
the
course
of
the
raid,
they
picked
up
a
recapitulation
sheet,
exhibit
41-c
which
indicated
that
there
were
three
different
groups
of
sellers
totaling
at
least
20
individuals
in
addition
to
runners
and
pickup
man
in
this
operation.
in
other
words,
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
no.
and
i
also
think
that
sometimes
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
that
was
the
largest
bet
this
individual
who
said
she
sold
tickets
at
the
house,
she
said,
the
largest
individual
--
she
bet
she
took
on
one
number
was
$5.00.
she
said
that
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
if
the
people
were
induced
to
cross
state
lines
were
all
innocent,
we
think
we
still
could
prevail
under
2
(b).
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
the
court
of
appeals'
elements,
that’s
correct.
right.
the
court
of
appeals
--
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
court
of
appeals
held
them
innocent,
ruling
that
a
better
who
traveled
in
interstate
commerce
couldn’t
violate
18
u.s.c.
1952.
now
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes,
that’s
correct.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
we
hold
rewis
under
2
--
when
18
u.s.c.
2
(b)
was
enacted,
the
revisers
at
least
thought
and
this
is
set
forth
on
page
12
of
our
brief
that
section
2
(b)
“removes
all
doubt
that
one
who
puts
in
motion
or
assist
in
the
illegal
enterprise,
but
causes
the
commission
of
an
indispensable
element
of
the
offense
by
an
innocent
agent
or
instrumentality
is
guilty
as
a
principal
even
though
he
intentionally
refrained
from
the
direct
act
constituting
the
completed
offense.
in
other
words,
even
though
you
did
everything,
but
one
particular
element
but
you
got
somebody
else,
to
me
the
best
case
of
the
--
the
best
illustration
of
this
case
is
the
kelly
case
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
and
the
kelly
case
involved
the
use
of
telephones
and
the
defendant
there
made
an
arrangement
whereby
the
betters
would
use
the
telephones
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
found
that
this
--
that
,
that
violated
the
statute
when
that
he
causes
--
caused
the
use
of
the
interstate
facility
when
the
betters
used
the
telephones.
basically,
to
sum
up,
we
think
that
just
as
if
rewis
and
williams
had
advertised
in
georgia
or
people
who
would
come
from
georgia
to
florida
and
people
who
read
their
advertisement
came
to
flor
--
from
georgia
to
florida
with
a
specific
purpose
to
betting
and
they
did
so
on
the
basis
of
reading
this
advertisement,
“come
to
florida
and
bet,”
that
in
such
circumstances,
we
think
rewis
and
williams
would
bring
about
or
cause
the
travel
of
the
better.
that
that
situation
is
similar
to
the
situation
here,
but
for,
but
for
the
conduct
of
rewis
and
williams
in
operating
this
lottery
and
making
it
possible
for
these
people
to
come
on
a
continuous
basis
to
their
operation,
there
would
have
been
no
gambling.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
would
assume
it
isn’t.
i
would
assume
it
isn’t
in
which
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
they
ran
a
place,
they
ran
a
place.
the
people
who
would
came
were
by
circumstantial
evidence
indicates
that
people
who
came
were
aware
of
the
fact
that
in
order
to
wager
or
to
participate
in
this
operation,
you
had
to
come
at
a
particular
time,
you
had
to
come
to
a
private
house
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
there
were
--
on
each
saturday,
as
i
understand
it,
the
average
number
of
people
who
showed
up
whether
from
georgia
or
florida
were
from
eight
to
16.
but
eight,
i
understand,
was
the
average
number.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
no.
the
total
number
of
people
who
came
were
average
eight.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
and,
and
--
there
were
the
same
people
didn't
come
every
week.
they
came
four
or
five
times
but
apparently,
at
least
eight
to
ten
of
them
came
from
georgia
who
they
could
identify.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
what,
no.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
they
just
--
they
would
come
in
at
a
particular
time
on
saturday
morning.
they
would
come
at
saturday
morning,
usually
from
ten
to
twelve
and
they
would
stay
a
short
time
and
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no.
just
--
it
would
just
to
be
over
--
it
would
just
operate
on
saturday
morning
which
is
the
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
what?
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
they
did
come
--
they
came
on
a
regular
basis.
they
came
at
a
particular
time.
they
could
--
they
came
to
a
place
where
which
was
a
private
home
and
the
only
they
came
to
a
place
that
only
somebody
who
was
aware
of
the
fact
that
this
--
that
you
could
bet,
that
betting
was
going
on
there,
so
from
that
point
of
view,
we
consider
it
all
prearranged.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
don’t
believe
that
the
record
will
bear
that
out.
that
assumption
of
fact
is
actually
of
the
14
saturdays
of
surveillance,
the
most
repetition
was
one
person
came
on
four
different
saturdays,
but
even
if
it
were
so,
was
so,
then
i
submit,
it
would
have
no
force.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
there
is
sufficient
evidence
to
show
that
petitioner
has
caused
other
people
not
themselves
to
travel
in
interstate
commerce
with
intent
to
promote
their
gambling
establishment,
whether
the
people
who
traveled
were
runners
or
customers.
the
issue
as
we
see
it
while
involves
the
construction
of
18
u.s.c.
1952
and
also
18
u.s.c
2
turns
in
large
part
on
the
facts.
now,
let
me
just
resay
--
restate
some
of
the
salient
facts.
it
is
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
we’ve
--
we
construe
the
indictment
as
charging,
traveling
in
interstate
commerce
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
and
causing
travel.
correct.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
read
the
statute
as
--
has
construed
the
statute
as
meaning
that
when
you
travel.
when
you
travel
or
cause
travel,
that
includes
the
use
of
interstate
facilities.
in
other
words,
i
think
they
have
used,
considered
the
term
travel
to
embrace
the
use
of
interstate
facilities.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right,
in
other
words,
they
consider
that
the
word
“travel”
embraces
the
use
of
interstate
facility
such
as
interstate
roads.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right.
using
the
telephone.
i
think
the
--
if
you
go
in
the
history
of
the
statute,
i
think
the
history
shows
that
the
use
of
interstate
facilities
was
added
to
the
bill
after
it
was
initially
introduced
to
broaden
the
bill
and
to
cover
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right.
right,
that’s
correct.
as
i
recall,
the
initial
was
just
a
travel
bill
and
then
on
the
--
either
one
of
the
committees
at
the
senate
house
committee
added
the
use
of
interstate
facilities
to
the
bill
as
introduced
by
the
department
of
justice.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
it
--
if
--
let
me
just
go
to
the
facts
and
i
think
if
i
answer
the
fact,
relate
the
facts,
i
think
it
comes
a
little
easier
to
answer
that
question
and
answer
in
the
abstract.
now,
the
business
that
was
operated
in
this
case
was
operated
in
a
private
home
of
petitioner
williams.
it
wasn’t
a
--
it
was
a
private
home
in
a
small
town
and
cluster
of
five
private
homes.
in
other
words,
it
--
the
location
was
such
that
an
interstate
traveler
wouldn’t
just
go
there
by
happenstance.
a
person
would
only
be
able
to
go
to
the
williams
house
and
enter
the
williams
house
for
gambling
purposes
if
he
in
fact
knew
gambling
was
going
on
there
and
if
in
fact,
if
the
people
knew
that
he
was
the
type
of
person
who
they
would
let
in.
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
--
there’s
a
little
misconception
in
this
case.
there
wasn’t
a
whole
group
of
people
who
went
to
the
williams
house
on
the
saturday
mornings
in
which
the
travel
occurred.
there
were
just
a
small
group
of
people
who
traveled
each
saturday
and
as
generally
the
same
eight
or
nine
people
who
traveled
and
the
evidence
showed
that
the
people
who
traveled
were
repeaters.
in
other
words,
the
same
people
would
come
each
week
and
some
of
the
people
--
some
of
the
people
who
came,
the
evidence
showed,
they
didn’t
just
go
and
buy
a
ticket
in
the
williams
house,
they
came
with
a
water
paper
and
with
money
and
the
evidence
shows
that
at
least
one
of
them
put
the
money
in
their
cigar
box
and
cigar
box
was
the
place
for
the
lottery
tickets
and
the
money
were
kept.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
williams
house
was
near
a
state
highway.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
what
would
you
say?
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
highway
--
state
highway
200
or
state
highway
a1-a
which
was
two
blocks
from
the
center
of
the
town
and
the
center
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yulee.
yulee,
florida
which
was
on
interstate
17
and
most
of
the
people
who
came
from
georgia.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
this
goes
on
jacksonville,
i
believe.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
don’t
know
where
it
started.
and
most
of
the
people
who
came
from
georgia
came
down
interstate
70
--
interstate
17
and
turned
on
highway
200
and
then
there’s
a
little
access
road
near
the
williams
house
and
they
drove
up
to
the
williams
house
and
stayed
a
very
short
time.
they
would
stay
about
15
minutes
and
then
they
would
leave.
now,
that
in
itself
is
significant.
the
lottery
itself
--
the
lottery
itself
--
the
winner
of
the
lottery
wasn’t
determined
until
two
o’clock
but
this
people
would
come
there
on
saturday
morning,
stay
about
15
minutes
and
leave.
now,
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right.
it
was
--
in
other
words,
their
journey
would
--
they
were
just
--
they
would
cross
the
georgia
border
into
florida
and
mainly
stay
at
the
house
for
a
short
time
and
turn
around
and
come
right
back
into
georgia.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
there
was
evidence
--
there
was
evidence
by
a
person
who
worked
in
the
house
that
on
occasion
--
she
would
--
she
said
she
sold
tickets
to
people
that
came
to
the
house
and
she
also
said
that
some
of
the
people
who
came,
these
people
who
were
the
court
of
appeals
found
were
gamblers
and
not
runners.
she
testified
that
those
two
people
when
they
came
under
four
or
five
occasions,
they
didn’t
just
simply
buy
a
ticket
from
her
but
that
they
brought
a
water
paper
and
one
of
them
brought
--
just
brought
at
one
point
at
least
$80.00.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
no.
they
didn’t
come
with
tickets,
they
came
with
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
the
woman
who
said
she
sold
tickets,
in
essence,
said,
she
sold
them
a
number.
they
would
pick
a
number,
say
19
and
pay
an
amount,
say
from
50
cents
to
$5.00
and
if
at
2
o’clock
in
the
afternoon,
19
was
the
number
drawn
in
cuba,
then
you’d
win
60
times
what
you
bet.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
the
tickets
were
written
out
in
long
hand.
i
mean
there
was
no
written
ticket.
so,
there
were
somebody
who
would
say,
number
19
and
ticket
would
be
written
up.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
it
was
really
a
numbers
game,
a
numbers
game,
lottery
in
a
broad
sense,
but
specifically
a
numbers
game.
now,
the
evidence
we
submit
warrants
the
conclusion
that
petitioners
caused
the
travel
of
these
people
as
we
said
before,
you
just
couldn’t
stumble
upon
this
place.
you
had
to
know
when
to
come
on
the
saturday
morning
and
this
warrants
the
inference
that
there
was
prearrangement
that
the
people
came
because
they
arranged
with
the
operators
to
come.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
there’s
only
circumstantial
evidence.
there’s
no
direct
evidence
of
any
advertisement
that
anybody
said
in
georgia,
come
down
to
mrs.
williams’
house
in
florida
and
gamble.
no,
there’s
no
direct
evidence.
the
only
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
indirect
evidence
is
the
location
of
the
establishment.
the
fact
that
the
only
--
the
people
who
went
there
were
habitual
travelers.
that
the
people
who
went
there
were
few
in
number
or
wasn’t
--
just
anybody
couldn’t
go
and
the
fact
that
they
came
back
over
and
over
again,
so
you
can
warrant
the
inference
that
was
implied
invitation
to
come
again
and
there’s
also
the
fact
that
you
had
to
know
what
time
to
go
there.
in
other
words,
the
--
the
people
generally
came
on
a
short
period
of
saturday
morning,
had
to
get
there
before
noon.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
they
might
be
guilty.
i’d
say,
they
would
definitely
be
guilty
if
after
the
person
came
the
first
time,
they
in
essence
said
come
again.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
think
if
they
could
foresee.
i
think
that’s
a
more
difficult
problem
than
you
have
to
reach
in
this
case.
if
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no.
no,
i’m
going
to
answer.
i
would
say,
yes.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
if
a
person
from
georgia
came
to
this
gambling
establishment
and
the
operators
didn’t
know
that
this
particular
person
came
from
georgia,
i
would
say
they
wouldn’t
violate
the
statute,
but
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
he
would
take
a
risk.
he
would
take
a
risk,
if
he
took
the
georgia
money,
the
georgia
better.
however,
i
don’t
think
that’s
this
case.
i
think,
this
case,
the
circumstances
are
such
to
make
it
come
within
18
u.s.c.
2
(b)
which
makes
a
--
makes
it
a,
makes
a
person
criminally
liable
when
he
causes
an
act
to
be
done
which
if
directly
performed
by
him
would
be
a
federal
offense.
in
other
words,
18
u.s.c.
2
(b)
was
added
in
1948
to
the
criminal
code
to
permit
deletion
of
cause
or
procurer
from
the
other
criminal
statutes
and
the
reviser’s
note
makes
clear
that
the
purpose,
the
purpose
of
this
provision
was
to
make,
remove
all
doubt
that
when
a
person
causes
the
commission
of
an
element
of
the
offense,
causes
an
innocent
person
to
commit
an
element
the
offense,
that
constitutes
a
violation.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right.
right
if
he
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right.
in
other
words,
the
easiest
illustration,
the
easiest
illustration
of
how
you
can
cause
somebody
to
come
would
be
a
situation
where
there
would
be
a
direct
--
suppose
a
narcotics
case
then.
there
was
a
seller
down
in
florida
and
a
purchaser
in
georgia
and
they
made
specific
arrangements
for
one
person
for
the
georgia
citizen
to
travel
down
to
florida.
there
would
be
--
it
would
be
clear
that
by
the
prearrangement,
the
seller
was
causing,
causing
the
person
to
travel
in
interstate
commerce.
the
thing
becomes
complicated
because
generally
--
generally,
in
a
crime,
for
example,
this
statute
makes
it
a
crime
to
travel
in
interstate
commerce
to
commit
extortion.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
what?
right.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no.
he
--
the
statute
makes
it
a
crime
for
him
to
travel
--
travel
from
state
to
state
with
intent
to
commit
extortion.
if
for
example
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
in
the
heart
of
atlanta
motel,
well,
that
was
in
a
companion
case,
the
heart
of
atlanta
motel
case,
that
was
a
restaurant
involved
where
interstate
travelers
stopped
and
this
court
held
that
that
activity
was
in
affect
commerce
and
was
subject
to
federal
regulation.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right,
right,
right.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
this
is
--
this
is
an
eating
place.
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right
and
it’s
our
position
that
the
language
of
this
statute
and
its
history
shows
that
it
interacts
with
the
18
u.s.c.
2
and
if
for
example,
if
a
person
commits
extortion
and
by
committing
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right,
right.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
continuous
business
conducted
at
this
establishment
with
awareness
that
people
from
georgia
were
coming
that
the
same
people
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
yes
sir.
i
would
say
that
the
proof
did
show
that.
as
to
mrs.
williams,
she
was
related
to
one
of
the
individuals
that
traveled
and
the
other,
there
was
another,
there
were
two
williams
in
this
case,
and
one
williams,
charlotte
williams
was
a
close
friend
of
her,
so
she
was
aware
of
that.
as
far
as
rewis
is
concerned,
he
would
arrive
at
the
place
at
a
time
when
there
were
a
lot
--
when
the
car
is
parked
there
included
georgia
cars.
so,
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
and
under
18
u.s.c.
2,
three
or
four
courts
of
appeals
have
held
that
when
an
employer
of
a
gambling
operation
employs
individuals
who
live
in
another
state
and
these
individuals
travel
from
say
illinois
to
wisconsin
that
that
violates
the
statute.
i
would
assume
that
that
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes,
we
would
think
it
was
under
2
(a)
that
he
would
be
an
aider
or
abater.
in
other
words,
2
(a)
seems
to
apply
to
a
situation
where
all
the
parties
are
clearly
guilty
of
a
violation
whereas
2
(b)
applies
to
the
situation
where
the
jurisdictional
element
or
an
element
of
the
crime
maybe
committed
--
maybe
done
by
somebody
who
himself
may
not
be
guilty
of
an
offense.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right
that
is
correct.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right,
the
bass
case
and
the
zizzo
case
and
i
think
the
barrow
case.
now,
the
problem
of
causation
as
i
said
before,
when
--
if
you
have
an
extortion
where
the
extortion
--
extortionist
lives
in
one
state
and
he
extorts
money
from
somebody
in
the
other
state
and
in
the
course
of
the
extortion,
that
person
travels
interstate
commerce
or
uses
an
interstate
facility,
i
think
it’s
easy
to
see
that
the
fear
--
the
fear
induced
by
the
extortionist
causes
the
jurisdictional
element
which
completes
the
offense.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
we
don’t
think
they’re
innocent
as
far
as,
for
example
two
of
them,
fuller
and
nightingale,
it
was
a
government’s
position
that
they
were
employees
and
the
evidence
showed
that
they
didn’t
just
merely
cross
the
state
line
and
buy
a
ticket
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right,
they
were
indicted
and
--
they
were
indicted,
convicted
and
the
court
of
appeals
set
aside
the
conviction.
the
court
of
appeals
--
on
the
ground
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient
to
show
that
they
were
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
to
show
that
they
were
runners.
they
were
anything
more
than
mere
betters.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
i
don’t
think
the
evidence
--
i
don’t
think
the
evidence
was
$75.00
a
week.
the
evidence
showed
that
rewis
had
$1500.00
in
his
pocket
and
i
think
you
can
infer
from
the
evidence
that
this
is
just
one
of
the
places
that
rewis
stopped
at
and
in
the
court
--
and
there’s
also
evidence
he
had
--
in
the
course
of
the
raid,
they
picked
up
a
recapitulation
sheet,
exhibit
41-c
which
indicated
that
there
were
three
different
groups
of
sellers
totaling
at
least
20
individuals
in
addition
to
runners
and
pickup
man
in
this
operation.
in
other
words,
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
no.
and
i
also
think
that
sometimes
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
that
was
the
largest
bet
this
individual
who
said
she
sold
tickets
at
the
house,
she
said,
the
largest
individual
--
she
bet
she
took
on
one
number
was
$5.00.
she
said
that
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
if
the
people
were
induced
to
cross
state
lines
were
all
innocent,
we
think
we
still
could
prevail
under
2
(b).
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
the
court
of
appeals'
elements,
that’s
correct.
right.
the
court
of
appeals
--
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
court
of
appeals
held
them
innocent,
ruling
that
a
better
who
traveled
in
interstate
commerce
couldn’t
violate
18
u.s.c.
1952.
now
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes,
that’s
correct.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
we
hold
rewis
under
2
--
when
18
u.s.c.
2
(b)
was
enacted,
the
revisers
at
least
thought
and
this
is
set
forth
on
page
12
of
our
brief
that
section
2
(b)
“removes
all
doubt
that
one
who
puts
in
motion
or
assist
in
the
illegal
enterprise,
but
causes
the
commission
of
an
indispensable
element
of
the
offense
by
an
innocent
agent
or
instrumentality
is
guilty
as
a
principal
even
though
he
intentionally
refrained
from
the
direct
act
constituting
the
completed
offense.
in
other
words,
even
though
you
did
everything,
but
one
particular
element
but
you
got
somebody
else,
to
me
the
best
case
of
the
--
the
best
illustration
of
this
case
is
the
kelly
case
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
and
the
kelly
case
involved
the
use
of
telephones
and
the
defendant
there
made
an
arrangement
whereby
the
betters
would
use
the
telephones
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
found
that
this
--
that
,
that
violated
the
statute
when
that
he
causes
--
caused
the
use
of
the
interstate
facility
when
the
betters
used
the
telephones.
basically,
to
sum
up,
we
think
that
just
as
if
rewis
and
williams
had
advertised
in
georgia
or
people
who
would
come
from
georgia
to
florida
and
people
who
read
their
advertisement
came
to
flor
--
from
georgia
to
florida
with
a
specific
purpose
to
betting
and
they
did
so
on
the
basis
of
reading
this
advertisement,
“come
to
florida
and
bet,”
that
in
such
circumstances,
we
think
rewis
and
williams
would
bring
about
or
cause
the
travel
of
the
better.
that
that
situation
is
similar
to
the
situation
here,
but
for,
but
for
the
conduct
of
rewis
and
williams
in
operating
this
lottery
and
making
it
possible
for
these
people
to
come
on
a
continuous
basis
to
their
operation,
there
would
have
been
no
gambling.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
would
assume
it
isn’t.
i
would
assume
it
isn’t
in
which
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
they
ran
a
place,
they
ran
a
place.
the
people
who
would
came
were
by
circumstantial
evidence
indicates
that
people
who
came
were
aware
of
the
fact
that
in
order
to
wager
or
to
participate
in
this
operation,
you
had
to
come
at
a
particular
time,
you
had
to
come
to
a
private
house
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
there
were
--
on
each
saturday,
as
i
understand
it,
the
average
number
of
people
who
showed
up
whether
from
georgia
or
florida
were
from
eight
to
16.
but
eight,
i
understand,
was
the
average
number.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
no.
the
total
number
of
people
who
came
were
average
eight.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
and,
and
--
there
were
the
same
people
didn't
come
every
week.
they
came
four
or
five
times
but
apparently,
at
least
eight
to
ten
of
them
came
from
georgia
who
they
could
identify.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
what,
no.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
they
just
--
they
would
come
in
at
a
particular
time
on
saturday
morning.
they
would
come
at
saturday
morning,
usually
from
ten
to
twelve
and
they
would
stay
a
short
time
and
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no.
just
--
it
would
just
to
be
over
--
it
would
just
operate
on
saturday
morning
which
is
the
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
what?
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
they
did
come
--
they
came
on
a
regular
basis.
they
came
at
a
particular
time.
they
could
--
they
came
to
a
place
where
which
was
a
private
home
and
the
only
they
came
to
a
place
that
only
somebody
who
was
aware
of
the
fact
that
this
--
that
you
could
bet,
that
betting
was
going
on
there,
so
from
that
point
of
view,
we
consider
it
all
prearranged.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
don’t
believe
that
the
record
will
bear
that
out.
that
assumption
of
fact
is
actually
of
the
14
saturdays
of
surveillance,
the
most
repetition
was
one
person
came
on
four
different
saturdays,
but
even
if
it
were
so,
was
so,
then
i
submit,
it
would
have
no
force.
