you
mean,
the
difference
is
that
the
operator
of
the
establishment,
in
this
circumstance
where
he
had
reason
to
expect
people
will
come
across
state
lines
to
visit
his
establishment
for
the
purpose
of
gambling,
he
is
himself
both
a
traveler
under
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that’s
the
government
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me
mr.
datz.
i’m
looking
at
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
setting
aside,
that
include,
do
you
think
that
gambling
operations
for
the
use
of
interstate
facility
by
way
of
the
state
commerce
or
those
who
anticipate
(inaudible).
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,

i
assume
we
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
that’s
what
your
telling
me
is,
you
might
still
be
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
to
say
that
we’re
not
in
fact
indicted
for
use
against
facilities
apparently
from
the
court
of
appeals
(voice
overlap)
--?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
you
can
review
this
fact
that
making
travelers
out
of
your
clients
merely
because
customers
come
from
georgia
into
the
florida?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
does
the
--
how
does
the
government
by
carefully
saying,
the
instruction
(inaudible)
violates
the
statute
that
this
court
just
to
be
imposed.
does
the
instruction
make
a
distinction
that
you
suggested
based
on
the
--
on
the
indictment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
the
indictment
charges
in
which
the
effects
charged,
sovereignty
of
the
interstate
commerce
or
use
of
any
facility?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
would
include
use
but
in
some
circumstances
now
others
not
included
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
that
he
will
cause
people
to
come
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
the
evidence
here
would
support
the
government’s
burden
upon
looking.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
would
suppose
that
these
petitioners
were
aware
that
their
customers
were
from
georgia?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
the
government
doesn’t
argue
that
(inaudible)
this
petitioner
was
(inaudible),
because
of
any
statement,
but
rather
they
are
caught
after
traveling
because
of
section
2
provision,
cause
of
an
act
which
is
performed
by
government
in
effect
to
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
had
to
be
vague
that
an
employee
traveling
for
that
purpose,
why
violates
the
statute
and
they
are
employees
who
cause
that,
do
that
travel
from
state
to
state,
therefore
principally
under
section
2?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
except
he
didn’t
use
the
(inaudible)
as
far
as
the
statute
is
concerned?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mere
betters
what
--
isn’t
that
--
can
a
better
be
guilty
if
he
comes
every
saturday
and
bets
in
some
game
for
$75
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
if
that
so,
this
speaks
or
poses
an
act
to
be
done
which
is
directly
performed
him
or
by
another
would
be
an
offense
against
the
united
states?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before
the
court
of
appeals
that
these
betters
did
not
committed
the
offense
in
the
united
states,
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

how
do
you
hold
