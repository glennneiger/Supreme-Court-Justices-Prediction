mr.

according
the

were
running

operation.
am
i
correct
that
the
only
way
they
could
escape
being
indicted
under
this

would
be
that
everybody
drove
up
and
go
by
the
state
and
say
no
business?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
glazer,
suppose
somebody
told
somebody
that
lottery

going
in
the

and
a
guy
stops
by
and
says
i
am
from
georgia,
and
well,
he
hit
the
lottery
that
day,
and
he
went
back
to

told
everybody
in
georgia
and

in
georgia
get
in

a
man
comes
and
said,
“i’m
from
georgia

a
number.”
the
only

take
no
georgia
