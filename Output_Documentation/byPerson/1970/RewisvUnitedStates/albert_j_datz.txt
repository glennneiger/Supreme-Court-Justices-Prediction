mr.
albert
j.
datz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
the
issue
here
is
whether
or
not
travel
in
interstate
commerce
is
necessary
for
guilt,
whether
or
not
the
travel
in
interstate
commerce
necessary
for
guilt
under
18
united
states
code
1952,
known
as
travel
act,
is
supplied
by
the
fact
that
the
gambling
players
or
customers
cross
a
state
line.
the
petitioners
here,
james
wintfored
rewis.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
yes
sir.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
i
believe
it’s
purely
statutory
construction.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
not
in
this
--
mr.
albert
j.
datz
this
is
not
involved
here,
your
honor.
i’m
aware
of
the
fact
that
congress
had
just
recently
passed
such
a
statute
in
anticipation
--
mr.
albert
j.
datz
we
don’t
go
that
far
--
mr.
albert
j.
datz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
well,
tangentially
that
in
the
recently
passed
act,
congress
did
declare
that
gambling
was
a
matter
of
interstate
commerce
per
se,
that
it
affected
interstate
commerce
and
attempted
to
regulate
it.
i
submit
and
this
is
not
in
the
brief,
nobody's
brief
had
raise
it,
but
that
might
even
be
additional
factors
to
consider
a
comparison
with
that
statute
and
the
travel
act
is
what
congress
could
have
done,
if
it
had
wanted
to.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
yes
your
honor.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
the
petitioner,
james
rewis
and
mary
williams
were
convicted
in
the
middle
district
of
florida
of
the
crime
involved
in
the
violation
of
18
united
states
code
1952,
known
as
the
travel
act,
that
is
of
traveling
and
causing
travel
in
interstate
commerce
with
and
intent
to
promote,
manage,
establish,
carry
on
and
to
facilitate
the
promotion
and
management,
establishment
and
carrying
on
of
a
gambling
activity.
now,
the
gambling
activity
involved
was
a
lottery
known
as
cuba.
and
in
this
particular
case,
cuba
is
called
cuba
because
at
that
time,
the
winning
number
was
picked
through
the
national
lottery
in
cuba.
it
was
picked
around
2
o’clock
on
a
saturday
afternoon
each
week
and
the
people
in
the
state
of
florida
who
were
actually
violating
the
laws
of
the
state
of
florida
and
running
this
“cuba
activity”
would
wait
and
get
the
winning
number
from
cuba
and
that
of
course
would
determine
the
winning
number
of
anybody
who
had
played.
now,
this
lottery,
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned
was
operated
from
the
home
of
mary
williams
at
a
small
community
between
jacksonville,
florida
and
fernandina
beach,
florida
known
as
yulee.
this
home
was
about
a
half
a
mile
from
the
main
highway
u.s.
17
which
led
to
georgia.
georgia
was
about
15
miles
north
of
yulee.
the
game
was
a
relatively
small
game
as
pointed
out
in
the
briefs.
i
believe
that
the
take
on
the
particular
saturday
which
--
in
which
it
was
rated
was
about
a
$125.00
although
concededly
that
rewis
who
we’ll
see
as
the
pick
up
man
or
operator
of
the
game,
had
over
$1500.00
in
his
pocket.
but
significantly,
the
winning
number
fell
on
the
saturday
afternoon
and
most
of
the
players
would
pick
their
numbers
on
friday
night
and
saturday
morning.
undoubtedly,
mary
williams
who
was
operating
a
selling
establishment
there
from
her
home
was
the
seller
of
the
numbers.
rewis
was
the
central
figure
who
picked
up
the
business
each
saturday,
around
noon,
before
the
winning
number
would
fall.
now,
the
issue
at
the
trial
as
here
was
whether
or
not
travel
by
some
customers
who
were
from
georgia
at
least
15
miles
to
the
north
invested
the
operation
with
this
travel
in
interstate
commerce
required
by
the
travel
act.
however,
the
theory
of
the
government
at
the
trial
and
the
theory
in
the
appellate
courts
is
different.
at
the
trial,
the
government
contended
and
the
district
judge
agreed
that
the
travel
of
the
customers
themselves
invested
this
illegal
activity
with
the
interstate
character
necessary
for
conviction
and
that
the
customers
or
betters
themselves
could
be
convicted
under
the
travel
act.
now,
after
the
conviction,
the
fifth
circuit
disagreed
with
that
concept.
originally,
there
were
11
people
indicted.
one
was
rewis’
wife
who
was
excused
because
of
illness.
four
had
directed
the
motions
for
judgment
of
acquittal
granted
by
the
trial
judge.
two
were
acquitted
by
the
jury
and
finally,
two
who
were
convicted,
their
convictions
were
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
on
the
theory
that
the
only
evidence
against
them
was
that
they
were
these
gamblers,
that
they
were
the
betters,
the
customers
and
that
the
travel
act
itself
did
not
proscribe
the
conduct
of
the
better,
only
the
operator
of
the
business
enterprise
as
defined
by
the
statute
itself.
subsection
b
of
the
statute,
section
1952
describes
the
unlawful
activity
as
a
business
enterprise
and
they
--
short
look
at
the
legislative
history
of
that
statute
shows
without
any
doubt
that
the
intent
of
congress
was
to
proscribe
the
activities
of
the
business
enterprise
and
we
submit
that
the
reverse
is
true
that
it
did
not
intend
to
proscribe
the
activities
of
the
better.
now,
the
government
has
not
contended
otherwise
here,
but
the
fifth
circuit
in
reversing
as
to
the
two
customers,
affirmed
of
conviction
as
to
the
rewis
and
williams,
the
last
two
remaining
defendants,
on
the
theory
that
by
placing
this
game,
this
lottery
within
15
miles
of
the
georgia
border,
that
they
had
attracted,
sort
of
an
attracted
nuisance
theory.
they
had
attracted
these
betters
from
the
state
of
georgia
to
florida
and
thus
the
interstate
character
was
bestowed
upon
this
gambling
operation.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
i
would
say
the
same
thing
that
the
--
it
did
not
violate
the
statute,
this
particular
travel
act
anyhow.
now,
we
might
get
into
another
area
on
the
question
of
use
of
interstate
facilities
to
promote,
manage
etcetera
a
gambling
operation
because
as
an
example,
suppose,
they
put
up
a
big
billboard
right
at
the
border
and
say,
“come
over
to
florida
and
participate
in
our
gambling
operation”
then
there
would
be
some
question
of
interstate
facility
but
not
travel
--
mr.
albert
j.
datz
i
don’t
believe
so.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
i
don’t
--
i
don’t
--
if
the
operators
had
traveled
in
interstate
commerce
to
put
that
sign
up
and
they
would
have
had
to
that
do
either
themselves
or
through
some
agent,
then
of
course,
they
would
be
guilty
because
they
are
the
operators.
they
are
promoting,
establishing,
maintaining
and
carrying
on
this
operation,
the
exact
word
the
statute
condemns.
but
the
mere
placing
of
the
sign
at
the
boarder
would
not
be
sufficient
or
placing
the
game
15
feet
from
the
boarder
would
not
be
sufficient.
but
here
we
have
15
miles
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
this
attracted
these
players
across
the
state
line
and
invested
the
case
with
the
interstate
character
necessary
for
conviction.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
i’m
sorry
your
honor,
i
didn’t
hear
it.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
i
would
tend
to
agree
your
honor
that
it
might
have
had
some
attraction
although
and
we
might
discuss
this
at
this
moment,
the
government
says
that
the
predominant
people
involved
were
georgia.
we
submit
the
record
would
show
otherwise
that
these
people
came
from
georgia
for
several
reasons.
one
of
the
witnesses
was
bringing
sewing
to
the
mary
williams
house,
her
mother
was
ill
and
she
brings
sewing
back
in
forth.
other
witnesses
would
come
at
jacksonville
to
buy
fish
to
take
the
pedal
up
in
georgia
and
stop
by
the
game
to
bet
a
number.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
yes
sir.
others
came
for
the
specific
purpose
of
gambling,
but
it
wasn’t
the
predominant
travel
involved.
this
is
–
as
an
example
there
were
14
different
successive
saturdays
involved
in
the
government’s
surveillance
of
this
mary
williams
home.
they
made
a
count
in
the
indictment
for
each
one
of
those
saturdays
claiming
interstate
travel.
now,
they
joined
mary
williams
and
rewis,
the
petitioner
rewis
in
each
of
those
counts
and
they
would
say
that
one
or
more
people
from
georgia
would
travel
on
those
particular
saturdays.
on
those
--
this
is
alleged
now
even
though
the
trial
judge
direct
--
entered
a
judgment
of
acquittal
as
to
four
of
these
people
and
the
jury
acquitted
the
two
on
the
theory
that
they
weren’t
even
customers
because
at
that
time,
the
trial
judge’s
theory
was
that
the
government’s
theory
was
that
if
they
were
customers,
they
were
guilty.
but
on
five
saturdays
they
say
one
person
came
from
georgia.
on
three
saturdays,
they
say
two
people
came
from
georgia.
on
four
saturdays,
they
say
that
three
people
came
from
georgia
and
on
two
saturdays
they
said
that
four
people
came
from
georgia.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
that’s
all
that
the
record
shows
your
honor
except
for
one
--
mr.
albert
j.
datz
a
lot.
well,
now
this
is
the
point.
the
--
you
have
to
see
the
movies
which
we
introduced
in
evidence
of
the
trial
to
know
this
and
for
this
reason,
i
hesitate
to
take
advantage
of
the
government,
but
there
were
a
lot
of
people
from
florida
going.
this
was
not
a
predominantly
georgia-type
of
operation
and
this
may
become
significant
in
connection
with
the
theory
that
the
government
offers
about
the
purpose
of
the
travel
predominantly.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
yes,
your
honor,
of
the
surveillance.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
yes
sir.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
yes
sir.
i
will
show
you
an
example.
they
would
take
the
--
they
would
take
this
surveillance
from
9
o’clock
on
a
saturday
morning
to
1
o’clock
saturday
afternoon.
they
would
then
say,
the
agents
of
the
fbi
testified
that
they
only
took
movies
of
those
people
they
thought
would
be
pertinent
to
the
investigation
and
this
was
late
in
the
investigation
where
they
were
concentrating
on
georgia
people.
on
one
saturday,
four
hours
of
surveillance
produced
three
minutes
of
movies.
on
another
saturday,
it
produced
eight
minutes
of
movies,
on
the
next
nine
and
on
the
last,
seven
minutes
of
movies
out
of
over
four
hours
of
surveillance.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
i
would
say,
it
would
be
no
different,
your
honor
that
if
a
100%
came
from
georgia.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
because
simply
that
the
government
takes
the
position
that
we
can
expound
a
new
theory
here
and
in
spite
of
the
language
of
the
statute
that
says
the
travel
must
be
to
promote
the
game,
that
the
defendants
could
be
guilty
if
you
apply
a
combination
of
the
mail
fraud
statute
and
the
mann
act
and
say
that
if
the
defendants
reasonably
expected
out
of
state
people
to
travel
to
their
game
for
the
specific
purpose
of
participating
in
that
gambling
operation,
then
the
government
says,
“we
can
now,
based
on
this
case,
hold
them
guilty
of
the
offense.”
we
submit
that
that
would
be
contrary
to
the
intent
of
congress,
from
a
simple
reading
of
the
statute,
much
less,
a
study
of
the
legislative
history
involved.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
i
believe
that’s
correct.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
then
--
mr.
albert
j.
datz
yes,
it
would.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
our
position,
if
it
please
the
court,
is
that
travel
required
by
the
statute
cannot
be
imputed
under
any
circumstances
by
the
simple
travel
of
a
customer
to
a
gambling
game.
the
government
maintains
that
it
can
be
imputed
to
the
gambling
game
if
the
operator
could
reasonably
foresee
that
a
better
would
come
to
the
game
and
cross
state
lines
in
doing
so
and
they
carry
it
further.
a
better
would
do
so
for
the
specific
purpose
of
gambling
in
that
game.
now,
the
reason
for
that
limitation
is
this.
otherwise,
and
we
submit
even
if
that
theory
is
accepted,
the
whole
expanse
of
the
travel
act
would
be
broadened
to
the
point
where
the
fbi
and
the
federal
government
would
be
in
the
minor
police
court
case
business.
every
--
this
case
simply
was
again
15
miles
from
georgia
because
as
the
fifth
circuit
said,
the
operator
should
reasonably
have
anticipated
that
people
would
come
from
georgia
to
play.
but
what
of
the
tourist
resort,
where
people
are
crossing
state
lines
all
the
time,
miami,
los
angeles,
and
new
york.
certainly,
every
hotel
operator
can
look
at
his
register
and
see
people
come
across
state
lines,
does
the
bathroom,
card
game
come
within
the
federal
jurisdiction.
does
the
prostitute
who
entertains
a
guest
knowing
that
he
comes
from
across
the
state
line
come
within
the
federal
jurisdiction?
the
vast
number
of
case
increase
would
be
fantastic
to
accept
the
government’s
theory
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
not
the
person
who
traveled
along
the
highway,
but
the
man
who
runs
the
house
would
be
subject
to
federal
jurisdiction,
the
man
who
runs
the
gambling
house
would
then
be
subject
to
federal
jurisdiction.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
i
submit
that
it
is.
they
tried
to
limit
it
in
what
we
submit
is
not
a
very
pragmatic
way
and
says
the
traveler
must
have
traveled
for
the
specific
purpose
of
gambling
or
participating
in
the
unlawful
activity.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
i
submit
that
it
would
not,
your
honor.
and
certainly
under
--
mr.
albert
j.
datz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
that’s
the
government’s
theory
as
i
understand
it.
now,
this
attraction
theory
limited
to
the
facts
of
this
however
becomes
even
more
expansive
because
here,
we
have
a
game
that
the
only
--
the
only
attraction
is
the
fact
that
it’s
15
miles
from
the
state
line.
every
border
town
then
automatically
comes
under
federal
jurisdiction
if
we
accept
--
if
this
--
mr.
albert
j.
datz
that’s
correct.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
no,
your
honor
because
in
this
case
there
was
no
allegation
of
use
of
facilities
in
interstate
commerce.
that
was
eliminated
from
this
case.
the
only
allegation
in
the
indictment
was
the
travel.
now,
there
was
an
allegation
in
the
conspiracy
count
that
a
violation
of
section
1953
which
is
carrying
gambling
paraphernalia
but
that
was
stricken
by
the
trial
judge
because
there
was
no
evidence.
so,
--
mr.
albert
j.
datz
we
do
not
assert
that.
we
do
not
take
a
position
one
way
or
the
other
your
honor
because
as
indicated,
there
is
some
new
legislation
that
congress
just
passed
a
month
or
so
ago
which
attempts
to
do
and
has
a
declared
purpose
that
gambling
has
an
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
but
i
think
it
would
be
improper
for
me
to
try
to
anticipate
a
ruling
and
that
is
certainly
going
to
come
and
that
under
that
statute
in
this
case
here.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
yes
sir.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
yes
sir.
but
i
might
add
that
even
in
that
legislation,
they
don’t
make
all
gambling
come
under
federal
jurisdiction.
only
big
games,
what
they
considered
big
games
and
they
defined
what
big
games
are.
it
has
to
be
a
certain
amount
of
money
involved
which
is
--
doesn’t
happen.
even
under
the
new
act,
we
wouldn’t
be
under
federal
jurisdiction
this
case.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
the
--
my
client
is
rewis,
was
the
man
who
would
go
by
mary
williams’
home
and
gather
the
money
and
to
figure
out
who
was
entitled
to
what.
now,
the
reason
i
dodge
your
honor’s
question
slightly
is
because
the
record
really
doesn’t
show
who
the
owner
is.
he
would
be
a
pick
up
man.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
yes
sir.
[attempt
to
laughter]
so,
now
the
government
attempts
to
bring
an
agency
proposition
in
here
under
section
--
title
18,
section
2
(b)
which
says
that
whoever
willfully
causes
an
act
to
be
performed
which
if
directly
performed
by
him
or
another
would
be
an
offense
against
the
united
states
is
punishable
as
a
principal.
but
we
submit
that
once
you
assume
that
the
better
is
not
a
traveler,
is
not
a
traveler
under
the
statute,
then
rewis
himself,
the
operator
cannot
incur
criminality
simply
because
the
better,
even
if
he
caused
the
better
to
cross
the
line
because
that
would
be
creating
a
new
offense.
now,
the
government
attempts
to
analogize
the
mann
act
violation
where
a
woman
is
enticed
into
interstate
commerce
for
the
purpose
of
prostitution.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
yes
sir.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
no.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
i
don’t
know,
your
honor.
i
think
that
there
it
becomes
a
close
question,
what
would
the
interstate
facility
be,
would
it
be
the
highway
and
that
would
be
the
only
interstate
facility
which
was
used
and
--
mr.
albert
j.
datz
yes
sir.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
i
submit
that
that
language
was
thrown
in
there.
i
--
mr.
albert
j.
datz
travel
in
interstate.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
that’s
correct.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
i
would
submit
that
it
is
if
it
please
your
honor.
the
--
as
i
say
that
--
mr.
albert
j.
datz
well,
there’s
no
evidence
of
travel
other
than
these
customers.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
oh,
that’s
right.
there’s
no
doubt.
there’s
no
dispute.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
that’s
correct.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
no,
your
honor.
the
way
the
statute
avoids
that
is
that
it
defines
the
“unlawful
activity”
as
any
business
enterprise
which
is
unlawful
in
the
state
where
it
occurs.
and
since
gambling
is
lawful
in
nevada,
this
wouldn’t
apply.
to
touch
very
briefly,
the
government
seeks
to
analogize
on
the
--
with
the
mann
act
and
the
language
of
congress
there
was
specifically
condemning
whoever
would
persuade,
induce,
entice
or
coerce
a
woman
to
travel
in
interstate
commerce
for
the
purpose
of
prostitution.
and
when
you
compare
that
statute
with
the
travel
act,
you
can
see
that
if
congress
had
intended
the
result
which
the
fifth
circuit
reached,
it
could
certainly
easily
have
said
so.
likewise,
they
analogize
in
the
--
with
the
mail
fraud
statute
and
say,
well,
the
victim
can
supply
the
mailing
under
those
circumstances
but
the
statutes
are
entirely
different.
the
mailing
there
simply
must
be
reasonably
foreseeable
in
furtherance
of
execution
of
the
scheme
to
defraud.
well,
all
mailing
to
--
in
furtherance
to
that
scheme
would
then
be
proscribed
by
the
statute
but
here
not
all
travel
is
proscribed
by
the
statute,
only
that
travel,
travel
to
promote
the
business
enterprise.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
yes
it
did,
your
honor.
it’s
quite
extensive
and
the
purpose
was
to
fight
“organized
crime.”
mr.
albert
j.
datz
yes
sir.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
gambling
is
specifically
one
of
the
state
crimes
included
within
the
definition
of
an
unlawful
activity.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
yes
sir.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
they
were
convicted
on
the
conspiracy
count
and
the
were
--
mr.
albert
j.
datz
rewis
was
convicted
on
the
conspiracy
count
and
--
mr.
albert
j.
datz
sir.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
yes
sir.
in
counts
of
five.
i
don’t
remember
all
of
them.
he
was
convicted
on
eight
of
the
counts.
there
were
two
of
them
they
skipped
when
they
went
through
it.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
i
think
most
of
them
say
that.
yes
sir.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
i
submit
that
it’s
not
your
honor
because
the
cause,
the
statute
doesn’t
use
the
word
cause
like
the
mail
fraud
statute
uses
the
word
cause.
it
would
only
come
in
by
cause
under
section
2
(b)
of
title
18
which
is
the
aid
and
abater
statute.
but
here
again,
that
statute
specifically
says
that
it
only
applies
to
the
acts
of
a
person
who
causes
another
to
do
an
act
which
if
he
himself
had
done
would
be
a
crime.
but
here,
the
travel
to
place
a
bet
even
if
rewis
himself
had
done,
it
would
not
be
a
crime
unless
you
want
to
take
the
anomalous
position
that
he
is
caused,
he
is
placing
a
bet
with
himself.
thank
you.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
no
sir
because
the
statute
--
only
to
the
statute
was
read
but
there
was
no
attempt
to
define
--
mr.
albert
j.
datz
right.
i
don’t
recall.
i
do
believe
that
there
was.
there
was
no
attempt
to
define.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
yes
sir.
thank
you.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
it
was
not
at
--
i
really
don’t
remember
whether
it
was
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals,
but
i
know
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
discuss
it.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
in
their
language
they
put
the
facility.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
no
sir.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
not
under
this
act.
frankly,
under
the
new
act
just
passed
it
does,
but
not
under
this
act.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
rewis
got
five
years,
mary
williams
got
three
years.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
yes,
to
run
concurrently.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
if
any
conviction
is
good,
then
it’s
moot.
if
i
may
point
out
briefly,
the
significant
difference
between
the
government
and
our
position
as
i
see
it
here,
is
the
interpretation
of
section
2
(b)
of
title
18.
now,
whoever
causes
another
to
do
an
act
is
limited.
title
18,
section
2
(b)
is
simply
an
agency
principal
relationship.
you
can’t
create
a
new
private
john
doe
who
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
case,
cause
these
people
to
travel
from
georgia
to
florida,
he
wouldn’t
be
committing
a
crime
because
the
people
themselves
were
not
committing
crimes.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
but
that’s
only
if
--
mr.
albert
j.
datz
but
that
doesn’t
really
apply
to
the
factual
situation
here.
thank
you.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
the
issue
here
is
whether
or
not
travel
in
interstate
commerce
is
necessary
for
guilt,
whether
or
not
the
travel
in
interstate
commerce
necessary
for
guilt
under
18
united
states
code
1952,
known
as
travel
act,
is
supplied
by
the
fact
that
the
gambling
players
or
customers
cross
a
state
line.
the
petitioners
here,
james
wintfored
rewis.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
yes
sir.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
i
believe
it’s
purely
statutory
construction.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
not
in
this
--
mr.
albert
j.
datz
this
is
not
involved
here,
your
honor.
i’m
aware
of
the
fact
that
congress
had
just
recently
passed
such
a
statute
in
anticipation
--
mr.
albert
j.
datz
we
don’t
go
that
far
--
mr.
albert
j.
datz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
well,
tangentially
that
in
the
recently
passed
act,
congress
did
declare
that
gambling
was
a
matter
of
interstate
commerce
per
se,
that
it
affected
interstate
commerce
and
attempted
to
regulate
it.
i
submit
and
this
is
not
in
the
brief,
nobody's
brief
had
raise
it,
but
that
might
even
be
additional
factors
to
consider
a
comparison
with
that
statute
and
the
travel
act
is
what
congress
could
have
done,
if
it
had
wanted
to.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
yes
your
honor.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
the
petitioner,
james
rewis
and
mary
williams
were
convicted
in
the
middle
district
of
florida
of
the
crime
involved
in
the
violation
of
18
united
states
code
1952,
known
as
the
travel
act,
that
is
of
traveling
and
causing
travel
in
interstate
commerce
with
and
intent
to
promote,
manage,
establish,
carry
on
and
to
facilitate
the
promotion
and
management,
establishment
and
carrying
on
of
a
gambling
activity.
now,
the
gambling
activity
involved
was
a
lottery
known
as
cuba.
and
in
this
particular
case,
cuba
is
called
cuba
because
at
that
time,
the
winning
number
was
picked
through
the
national
lottery
in
cuba.
it
was
picked
around
2
o’clock
on
a
saturday
afternoon
each
week
and
the
people
in
the
state
of
florida
who
were
actually
violating
the
laws
of
the
state
of
florida
and
running
this
“cuba
activity”
would
wait
and
get
the
winning
number
from
cuba
and
that
of
course
would
determine
the
winning
number
of
anybody
who
had
played.
now,
this
lottery,
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned
was
operated
from
the
home
of
mary
williams
at
a
small
community
between
jacksonville,
florida
and
fernandina
beach,
florida
known
as
yulee.
this
home
was
about
a
half
a
mile
from
the
main
highway
u.s.
17
which
led
to
georgia.
georgia
was
about
15
miles
north
of
yulee.
the
game
was
a
relatively
small
game
as
pointed
out
in
the
briefs.
i
believe
that
the
take
on
the
particular
saturday
which
--
in
which
it
was
rated
was
about
a
$125.00
although
concededly
that
rewis
who
we’ll
see
as
the
pick
up
man
or
operator
of
the
game,
had
over
$1500.00
in
his
pocket.
but
significantly,
the
winning
number
fell
on
the
saturday
afternoon
and
most
of
the
players
would
pick
their
numbers
on
friday
night
and
saturday
morning.
undoubtedly,
mary
williams
who
was
operating
a
selling
establishment
there
from
her
home
was
the
seller
of
the
numbers.
rewis
was
the
central
figure
who
picked
up
the
business
each
saturday,
around
noon,
before
the
winning
number
would
fall.
now,
the
issue
at
the
trial
as
here
was
whether
or
not
travel
by
some
customers
who
were
from
georgia
at
least
15
miles
to
the
north
invested
the
operation
with
this
travel
in
interstate
commerce
required
by
the
travel
act.
however,
the
theory
of
the
government
at
the
trial
and
the
theory
in
the
appellate
courts
is
different.
at
the
trial,
the
government
contended
and
the
district
judge
agreed
that
the
travel
of
the
customers
themselves
invested
this
illegal
activity
with
the
interstate
character
necessary
for
conviction
and
that
the
customers
or
betters
themselves
could
be
convicted
under
the
travel
act.
now,
after
the
conviction,
the
fifth
circuit
disagreed
with
that
concept.
originally,
there
were
11
people
indicted.
one
was
rewis’
wife
who
was
excused
because
of
illness.
four
had
directed
the
motions
for
judgment
of
acquittal
granted
by
the
trial
judge.
two
were
acquitted
by
the
jury
and
finally,
two
who
were
convicted,
their
convictions
were
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
on
the
theory
that
the
only
evidence
against
them
was
that
they
were
these
gamblers,
that
they
were
the
betters,
the
customers
and
that
the
travel
act
itself
did
not
proscribe
the
conduct
of
the
better,
only
the
operator
of
the
business
enterprise
as
defined
by
the
statute
itself.
subsection
b
of
the
statute,
section
1952
describes
the
unlawful
activity
as
a
business
enterprise
and
they
--
short
look
at
the
legislative
history
of
that
statute
shows
without
any
doubt
that
the
intent
of
congress
was
to
proscribe
the
activities
of
the
business
enterprise
and
we
submit
that
the
reverse
is
true
that
it
did
not
intend
to
proscribe
the
activities
of
the
better.
now,
the
government
has
not
contended
otherwise
here,
but
the
fifth
circuit
in
reversing
as
to
the
two
customers,
affirmed
of
conviction
as
to
the
rewis
and
williams,
the
last
two
remaining
defendants,
on
the
theory
that
by
placing
this
game,
this
lottery
within
15
miles
of
the
georgia
border,
that
they
had
attracted,
sort
of
an
attracted
nuisance
theory.
they
had
attracted
these
betters
from
the
state
of
georgia
to
florida
and
thus
the
interstate
character
was
bestowed
upon
this
gambling
operation.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
i
would
say
the
same
thing
that
the
--
it
did
not
violate
the
statute,
this
particular
travel
act
anyhow.
now,
we
might
get
into
another
area
on
the
question
of
use
of
interstate
facilities
to
promote,
manage
etcetera
a
gambling
operation
because
as
an
example,
suppose,
they
put
up
a
big
billboard
right
at
the
border
and
say,
“come
over
to
florida
and
participate
in
our
gambling
operation”
then
there
would
be
some
question
of
interstate
facility
but
not
travel
--
mr.
albert
j.
datz
i
don’t
believe
so.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
i
don’t
--
i
don’t
--
if
the
operators
had
traveled
in
interstate
commerce
to
put
that
sign
up
and
they
would
have
had
to
that
do
either
themselves
or
through
some
agent,
then
of
course,
they
would
be
guilty
because
they
are
the
operators.
they
are
promoting,
establishing,
maintaining
and
carrying
on
this
operation,
the
exact
word
the
statute
condemns.
but
the
mere
placing
of
the
sign
at
the
boarder
would
not
be
sufficient
or
placing
the
game
15
feet
from
the
boarder
would
not
be
sufficient.
but
here
we
have
15
miles
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
this
attracted
these
players
across
the
state
line
and
invested
the
case
with
the
interstate
character
necessary
for
conviction.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
i’m
sorry
your
honor,
i
didn’t
hear
it.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
i
would
tend
to
agree
your
honor
that
it
might
have
had
some
attraction
although
and
we
might
discuss
this
at
this
moment,
the
government
says
that
the
predominant
people
involved
were
georgia.
we
submit
the
record
would
show
otherwise
that
these
people
came
from
georgia
for
several
reasons.
one
of
the
witnesses
was
bringing
sewing
to
the
mary
williams
house,
her
mother
was
ill
and
she
brings
sewing
back
in
forth.
other
witnesses
would
come
at
jacksonville
to
buy
fish
to
take
the
pedal
up
in
georgia
and
stop
by
the
game
to
bet
a
number.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
yes
sir.
others
came
for
the
specific
purpose
of
gambling,
but
it
wasn’t
the
predominant
travel
involved.
this
is
–
as
an
example
there
were
14
different
successive
saturdays
involved
in
the
government’s
surveillance
of
this
mary
williams
home.
they
made
a
count
in
the
indictment
for
each
one
of
those
saturdays
claiming
interstate
travel.
now,
they
joined
mary
williams
and
rewis,
the
petitioner
rewis
in
each
of
those
counts
and
they
would
say
that
one
or
more
people
from
georgia
would
travel
on
those
particular
saturdays.
on
those
--
this
is
alleged
now
even
though
the
trial
judge
direct
--
entered
a
judgment
of
acquittal
as
to
four
of
these
people
and
the
jury
acquitted
the
two
on
the
theory
that
they
weren’t
even
customers
because
at
that
time,
the
trial
judge’s
theory
was
that
the
government’s
theory
was
that
if
they
were
customers,
they
were
guilty.
but
on
five
saturdays
they
say
one
person
came
from
georgia.
on
three
saturdays,
they
say
two
people
came
from
georgia.
on
four
saturdays,
they
say
that
three
people
came
from
georgia
and
on
two
saturdays
they
said
that
four
people
came
from
georgia.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
that’s
all
that
the
record
shows
your
honor
except
for
one
--
mr.
albert
j.
datz
a
lot.
well,
now
this
is
the
point.
the
--
you
have
to
see
the
movies
which
we
introduced
in
evidence
of
the
trial
to
know
this
and
for
this
reason,
i
hesitate
to
take
advantage
of
the
government,
but
there
were
a
lot
of
people
from
florida
going.
this
was
not
a
predominantly
georgia-type
of
operation
and
this
may
become
significant
in
connection
with
the
theory
that
the
government
offers
about
the
purpose
of
the
travel
predominantly.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
yes,
your
honor,
of
the
surveillance.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
yes
sir.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
yes
sir.
i
will
show
you
an
example.
they
would
take
the
--
they
would
take
this
surveillance
from
9
o’clock
on
a
saturday
morning
to
1
o’clock
saturday
afternoon.
they
would
then
say,
the
agents
of
the
fbi
testified
that
they
only
took
movies
of
those
people
they
thought
would
be
pertinent
to
the
investigation
and
this
was
late
in
the
investigation
where
they
were
concentrating
on
georgia
people.
on
one
saturday,
four
hours
of
surveillance
produced
three
minutes
of
movies.
on
another
saturday,
it
produced
eight
minutes
of
movies,
on
the
next
nine
and
on
the
last,
seven
minutes
of
movies
out
of
over
four
hours
of
surveillance.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
i
would
say,
it
would
be
no
different,
your
honor
that
if
a
100%
came
from
georgia.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
because
simply
that
the
government
takes
the
position
that
we
can
expound
a
new
theory
here
and
in
spite
of
the
language
of
the
statute
that
says
the
travel
must
be
to
promote
the
game,
that
the
defendants
could
be
guilty
if
you
apply
a
combination
of
the
mail
fraud
statute
and
the
mann
act
and
say
that
if
the
defendants
reasonably
expected
out
of
state
people
to
travel
to
their
game
for
the
specific
purpose
of
participating
in
that
gambling
operation,
then
the
government
says,
“we
can
now,
based
on
this
case,
hold
them
guilty
of
the
offense.”
we
submit
that
that
would
be
contrary
to
the
intent
of
congress,
from
a
simple
reading
of
the
statute,
much
less,
a
study
of
the
legislative
history
involved.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
i
believe
that’s
correct.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
then
--
mr.
albert
j.
datz
yes,
it
would.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
our
position,
if
it
please
the
court,
is
that
travel
required
by
the
statute
cannot
be
imputed
under
any
circumstances
by
the
simple
travel
of
a
customer
to
a
gambling
game.
the
government
maintains
that
it
can
be
imputed
to
the
gambling
game
if
the
operator
could
reasonably
foresee
that
a
better
would
come
to
the
game
and
cross
state
lines
in
doing
so
and
they
carry
it
further.
a
better
would
do
so
for
the
specific
purpose
of
gambling
in
that
game.
now,
the
reason
for
that
limitation
is
this.
otherwise,
and
we
submit
even
if
that
theory
is
accepted,
the
whole
expanse
of
the
travel
act
would
be
broadened
to
the
point
where
the
fbi
and
the
federal
government
would
be
in
the
minor
police
court
case
business.
every
--
this
case
simply
was
again
15
miles
from
georgia
because
as
the
fifth
circuit
said,
the
operator
should
reasonably
have
anticipated
that
people
would
come
from
georgia
to
play.
but
what
of
the
tourist
resort,
where
people
are
crossing
state
lines
all
the
time,
miami,
los
angeles,
and
new
york.
certainly,
every
hotel
operator
can
look
at
his
register
and
see
people
come
across
state
lines,
does
the
bathroom,
card
game
come
within
the
federal
jurisdiction.
does
the
prostitute
who
entertains
a
guest
knowing
that
he
comes
from
across
the
state
line
come
within
the
federal
jurisdiction?
the
vast
number
of
case
increase
would
be
fantastic
to
accept
the
government’s
theory
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
not
the
person
who
traveled
along
the
highway,
but
the
man
who
runs
the
house
would
be
subject
to
federal
jurisdiction,
the
man
who
runs
the
gambling
house
would
then
be
subject
to
federal
jurisdiction.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
i
submit
that
it
is.
they
tried
to
limit
it
in
what
we
submit
is
not
a
very
pragmatic
way
and
says
the
traveler
must
have
traveled
for
the
specific
purpose
of
gambling
or
participating
in
the
unlawful
activity.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
i
submit
that
it
would
not,
your
honor.
and
certainly
under
--
mr.
albert
j.
datz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
that’s
the
government’s
theory
as
i
understand
it.
now,
this
attraction
theory
limited
to
the
facts
of
this
however
becomes
even
more
expansive
because
here,
we
have
a
game
that
the
only
--
the
only
attraction
is
the
fact
that
it’s
15
miles
from
the
state
line.
every
border
town
then
automatically
comes
under
federal
jurisdiction
if
we
accept
--
if
this
--
mr.
albert
j.
datz
that’s
correct.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
no,
your
honor
because
in
this
case
there
was
no
allegation
of
use
of
facilities
in
interstate
commerce.
that
was
eliminated
from
this
case.
the
only
allegation
in
the
indictment
was
the
travel.
now,
there
was
an
allegation
in
the
conspiracy
count
that
a
violation
of
section
1953
which
is
carrying
gambling
paraphernalia
but
that
was
stricken
by
the
trial
judge
because
there
was
no
evidence.
so,
--
mr.
albert
j.
datz
we
do
not
assert
that.
we
do
not
take
a
position
one
way
or
the
other
your
honor
because
as
indicated,
there
is
some
new
legislation
that
congress
just
passed
a
month
or
so
ago
which
attempts
to
do
and
has
a
declared
purpose
that
gambling
has
an
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
but
i
think
it
would
be
improper
for
me
to
try
to
anticipate
a
ruling
and
that
is
certainly
going
to
come
and
that
under
that
statute
in
this
case
here.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
yes
sir.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
yes
sir.
but
i
might
add
that
even
in
that
legislation,
they
don’t
make
all
gambling
come
under
federal
jurisdiction.
only
big
games,
what
they
considered
big
games
and
they
defined
what
big
games
are.
it
has
to
be
a
certain
amount
of
money
involved
which
is
--
doesn’t
happen.
even
under
the
new
act,
we
wouldn’t
be
under
federal
jurisdiction
this
case.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
the
--
my
client
is
rewis,
was
the
man
who
would
go
by
mary
williams’
home
and
gather
the
money
and
to
figure
out
who
was
entitled
to
what.
now,
the
reason
i
dodge
your
honor’s
question
slightly
is
because
the
record
really
doesn’t
show
who
the
owner
is.
he
would
be
a
pick
up
man.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
yes
sir.
[attempt
to
laughter]
so,
now
the
government
attempts
to
bring
an
agency
proposition
in
here
under
section
--
title
18,
section
2
(b)
which
says
that
whoever
willfully
causes
an
act
to
be
performed
which
if
directly
performed
by
him
or
another
would
be
an
offense
against
the
united
states
is
punishable
as
a
principal.
but
we
submit
that
once
you
assume
that
the
better
is
not
a
traveler,
is
not
a
traveler
under
the
statute,
then
rewis
himself,
the
operator
cannot
incur
criminality
simply
because
the
better,
even
if
he
caused
the
better
to
cross
the
line
because
that
would
be
creating
a
new
offense.
now,
the
government
attempts
to
analogize
the
mann
act
violation
where
a
woman
is
enticed
into
interstate
commerce
for
the
purpose
of
prostitution.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
yes
sir.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
no.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
i
don’t
know,
your
honor.
i
think
that
there
it
becomes
a
close
question,
what
would
the
interstate
facility
be,
would
it
be
the
highway
and
that
would
be
the
only
interstate
facility
which
was
used
and
--
mr.
albert
j.
datz
yes
sir.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
i
submit
that
that
language
was
thrown
in
there.
i
--
mr.
albert
j.
datz
travel
in
interstate.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
that’s
correct.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
i
would
submit
that
it
is
if
it
please
your
honor.
the
--
as
i
say
that
--
mr.
albert
j.
datz
well,
there’s
no
evidence
of
travel
other
than
these
customers.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
oh,
that’s
right.
there’s
no
doubt.
there’s
no
dispute.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
that’s
correct.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
no,
your
honor.
the
way
the
statute
avoids
that
is
that
it
defines
the
“unlawful
activity”
as
any
business
enterprise
which
is
unlawful
in
the
state
where
it
occurs.
and
since
gambling
is
lawful
in
nevada,
this
wouldn’t
apply.
to
touch
very
briefly,
the
government
seeks
to
analogize
on
the
--
with
the
mann
act
and
the
language
of
congress
there
was
specifically
condemning
whoever
would
persuade,
induce,
entice
or
coerce
a
woman
to
travel
in
interstate
commerce
for
the
purpose
of
prostitution.
and
when
you
compare
that
statute
with
the
travel
act,
you
can
see
that
if
congress
had
intended
the
result
which
the
fifth
circuit
reached,
it
could
certainly
easily
have
said
so.
likewise,
they
analogize
in
the
--
with
the
mail
fraud
statute
and
say,
well,
the
victim
can
supply
the
mailing
under
those
circumstances
but
the
statutes
are
entirely
different.
the
mailing
there
simply
must
be
reasonably
foreseeable
in
furtherance
of
execution
of
the
scheme
to
defraud.
well,
all
mailing
to
--
in
furtherance
to
that
scheme
would
then
be
proscribed
by
the
statute
but
here
not
all
travel
is
proscribed
by
the
statute,
only
that
travel,
travel
to
promote
the
business
enterprise.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
yes
it
did,
your
honor.
it’s
quite
extensive
and
the
purpose
was
to
fight
“organized
crime.”
mr.
albert
j.
datz
yes
sir.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
gambling
is
specifically
one
of
the
state
crimes
included
within
the
definition
of
an
unlawful
activity.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
yes
sir.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
they
were
convicted
on
the
conspiracy
count
and
the
were
--
mr.
albert
j.
datz
rewis
was
convicted
on
the
conspiracy
count
and
--
mr.
albert
j.
datz
sir.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
yes
sir.
in
counts
of
five.
i
don’t
remember
all
of
them.
he
was
convicted
on
eight
of
the
counts.
there
were
two
of
them
they
skipped
when
they
went
through
it.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
i
think
most
of
them
say
that.
yes
sir.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
i
submit
that
it’s
not
your
honor
because
the
cause,
the
statute
doesn’t
use
the
word
cause
like
the
mail
fraud
statute
uses
the
word
cause.
it
would
only
come
in
by
cause
under
section
2
(b)
of
title
18
which
is
the
aid
and
abater
statute.
but
here
again,
that
statute
specifically
says
that
it
only
applies
to
the
acts
of
a
person
who
causes
another
to
do
an
act
which
if
he
himself
had
done
would
be
a
crime.
but
here,
the
travel
to
place
a
bet
even
if
rewis
himself
had
done,
it
would
not
be
a
crime
unless
you
want
to
take
the
anomalous
position
that
he
is
caused,
he
is
placing
a
bet
with
himself.
thank
you.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
no
sir
because
the
statute
--
only
to
the
statute
was
read
but
there
was
no
attempt
to
define
--
mr.
albert
j.
datz
right.
i
don’t
recall.
i
do
believe
that
there
was.
there
was
no
attempt
to
define.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
yes
sir.
thank
you.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
it
was
not
at
--
i
really
don’t
remember
whether
it
was
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals,
but
i
know
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
discuss
it.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
in
their
language
they
put
the
facility.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
no
sir.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
not
under
this
act.
frankly,
under
the
new
act
just
passed
it
does,
but
not
under
this
act.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
rewis
got
five
years,
mary
williams
got
three
years.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
yes,
to
run
concurrently.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
if
any
conviction
is
good,
then
it’s
moot.
if
i
may
point
out
briefly,
the
significant
difference
between
the
government
and
our
position
as
i
see
it
here,
is
the
interpretation
of
section
2
(b)
of
title
18.
now,
whoever
causes
another
to
do
an
act
is
limited.
title
18,
section
2
(b)
is
simply
an
agency
principal
relationship.
you
can’t
create
a
new
private
john
doe
who
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
case,
cause
these
people
to
travel
from
georgia
to
florida,
he
wouldn’t
be
committing
a
crime
because
the
people
themselves
were
not
committing
crimes.
mr.
albert
j.
datz
but
that’s
only
if
--
mr.
albert
j.
datz
but
that
doesn’t
really
apply
to
the
factual
situation
here.
thank
you.
