what’s
your
idea
of
suspicion,
the
word
“suspicion”?
justice
thurgood
marshall
such
as
the
person
had
shifty
eyes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
you
said
you
didn’t
believe.
you
just
wasn’t
sure.
justice
thurgood
marshall
getting
back
to
this
particular
case,
if
this
officer
had
been
a
brand
new
officer
of
three
days
on
duty,
would
your
argument
be
the
same?
justice
thurgood
marshall
because,
as
i
read
the
s--
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don’t
see
anything
in
the
statute
that
says
he
has
to
have
any
experience.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
statute
doesn’t
require
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any
regulation
of
the
treasury
or
immigration
which
define
suspicion?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
does
the
agent
know
what
is
suspicion?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
he
thinks.
whatever
he
thinks
suspicion--
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
on
the
basis--
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
it
say
what
suspicion
is
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
it
say
anything.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
does
it
say?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
it--
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
never
is
told
what
suspicion
is.
justice
thurgood
marshall
by
going
on
the
basis
of
what
he
suddenly
thinks
in
his
mind,
he
has
the
right
to
stop
made,
hold
made,
under
guard,
and
has
somebody
search
him
upon
his
suspicion.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
applies
to
anybody,
any
american
citizen
that
comes
back.

only
interested
in
american
citizens
right
