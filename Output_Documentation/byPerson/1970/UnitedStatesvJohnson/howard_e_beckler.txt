mr.
howard
e.
beckler
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
may
please
the
court,
i
have
had
an
extremely
difficult
last
few
moments
in
beginning
my
argument
because
i’ve
heard
some
of
the
inquiries
presented
by
this
honorable
court
to
my
opponent,
the
petitioner.
and,
rather
than
reply
directly
to
any
of
the
petitioner’s
argument,
i
think
i
have
elected
and
will
do
and
proceed
to
what
i
believe
to
be
the
gravamen
of
this
case,
i
believe
to
be
the
critical
issue
here,
it’s
been
raised
by
your
honorable
court
already
this
morning,
and
go
on
to
some
concluding
remarks.
first
and
foremost,
when
congress
enacted
the
laws,
border
search
law
on
vessels
and
travelers,
it
cannot
be
imagined
they
had
in
those
days
even
a
remote
thought
that
a
party
coming
into
this
country
might
be
made
naked
at
a
port
of
entry
so
their
body
could
even
be
looked
at.
when
the
government
here
in
frames
the
issue
that
the
reason
a
person
is
told
to
get
nude
is
to
look
at
their
clothing,
that’s
true.
that
is
incidental
to
their
remaining
naked
in
a
room,
as
appears
in
the
government’s
brief,
perhaps
15
minutes
while
the
custom
inspector
looks
over
these
clothes.
in
this
day
and
age,
when
every
travel
agency,
when
every
port,
when
every
hotel
suggest
that
our
country
travel,
when
travel
is
permitted
to
even
the
poor
and
the
modest
people
for
a
day
in
canada
or
a
trip
shopping
in
nogales,
arizona
or,
as
is
correct,
san
ysidro,
california,
it
cannot
be
in
the
reasonable
expectation
of
the
public.
it
cannot
be
understandable
to
the
public
in
terms
that
they
can
know
that,
by
crossing
this
border,
upon
returning
to
this
country
or
as
an
associate
in
the
offices
coming
home,
they’ll
be
told
on
the
mere
suspicion
of
an
officer
“all
be
it
27
years
or
1
year
to
go
into
a
private
room
and
remove
your
clothing--
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
no,
i
do
not.
i
think
the--
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
i
think
the
difference
is
two-fold.
one,
in
balancing
the
interest,
as
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
mentioned
this
morning,
the
search
of
the
briefcase.
in
this
day
and
age,
when
there
are
things
to
be
concerned
with,
it’s
a
minor
intrusion
that
i
open
my
attaché
case
this
morning.
it’s
a
minor
intrusion.
in
the
courts
of
los
angeles,
it’s
the
same
intrusion
and,
to
enjoy
the
practice
of
my
profession,
i
will
submit
to
that.
but,
to
balance
coming
back
into
the
country
after
a
day
to
be
told
to
get
naked,
i
don’t
think
is
a
fair
analogy.
the
privacy
that
your
honor
refers
to
in
a
doctor’s
office
cannot
be
equated,
and
i
might
add
there
are
many
people
in
this
day
and
age
that
may
not
be
considered
puritanical
that
do
object
to
removing
all
of
their
clothing
in
a
doctor’s
office.
teenagers,
for
example,
even
old
women
who
had
their
first
illness
don’t
like
to
get
naked
at
a
doctor’s
office,
but
is
that
anticipated
upon
coming
back
to
the
country
that
one
stranger,
a
customs
officer,
all
be
it
experience,
has
that
power
on
an
encode,
hunch,
or
a
guess,
as
mr.
justice
marshall
mentioned
this
morning,
what
is
it?
can
it
be
telepathy?
can
it
be
skittish
behavior?
and
select
that
person
and
say
“you,
go
in
and
remove
your
clothing
for
a
search.”
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
i
have
two
answers.
i
think
both
of
them
cogent.
one,
appears
in
the
government’s
brief
that
they
concede
that
only
a
small
amount
of
narcotics
comes
into
the
country
through
the
body
cavity
or
carried
on
the
person.
second
of
all--
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
no,
i’m
talking,
your
honor,
in
underwear.
there’s
an
article
that
appears
in
march
29,
1971,
the
news
week
issue
and,
in
this
article,
they
talk
about
the
government’s
fight
against
the
white
death,
referring
of
course
to
heroine.
in
the
article,
they
refer
to
a
port
off
of
marsay
where
750
pounds
of
morphine
base,
the
ultimate
substance
that
is
used
to
make
heroine,
was
found
by
a
fisherman
accidentally.
they
waited
for
someone
to
pick
up
this
contraband
and,
low
and
behold,
they
captured
a
man
named
tuddy
yan,
a
notorious
narcotic
smuggler.
further
in
the
article
in
news
week,
they
reflect
that
from
the
capital
of
laos
in
vien
tien,
through
the
united
states
mail
to
saigon,
20
pounds
of
pure
heroin
were
received
by
a
suspect
there.
the
point
is
this.
that
we
will
not
stop
the
major
amount
of
smuggling
in
the
country
if
we
were
to
search
arbitrarily
15
out
of
15
and
if
a
few
ounces,
and
i
agree
it’s
insipid,
it’s
a
hideous
ailment,
i
am
a
criminal
practitioner
at
13
years
i’ve
dealt
with
it,
we
still
will
find
two
ounces,
we
will
find
three
ounces
of
the
major
amount
of
contraband
in
the
country.
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
i
would
s--
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
i
would
say
we
have
to
balance
the
interest
here.
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
no,
between
the
initiation
of
the
search
and
not
the
result.
i
think
that
if,
by
fortuitous,
a
customs
agent
got
lucky
and
found
50
ounces,
i
would
not
change
my
argument
to
say
that
he’s
search,
if
it
was
based
on
mere
suspicion
as
this
one
was,
was
any
better
at
the
outset.
i
would
feel
shegreen
that
50
ounces
of
heroin
came
into
the
country.
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
if
that
right
to
search
that
person
is
given,
it
should
be
based
on
an
articulable
objective
statement
that
the
officer
can
explain
to
the
trier
of
the
fact
that
why
he
wanted
that
person
stopped.
now,
the
customs
agents,
themselves,
it
was
asked
this
morning
of
counsel
for
the
government,
what
rules
do
customs
have
to
go
by?
and,
in
the
brief
of
the
government,
on
page
35,
there
begins
numerous
of
the
customs
rules
they
have
propagated
themselves.
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
yes,
that’s
a
lucky
meek
sheet,
mr.
justice,
where
they
have
had
a
history
of
experience
with
that
person
before.
it
is
referred
to
as
one
of
the
circumstances
objectively
to
stop
a
person
whether
or
not
they
appear
on
the
sound
desk.
that’s
an
easy
reference
spindle
where
they
find
a
person
has
been
there
once
before.
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
who
has
had
contraband
or
been
arrested
as
a
suspect.
some
of
the
other
things
indicated
in
the
customs
manual
which
was
not
followed
in
the
case
at
bar
are
hypodermic
outfits
found
in
the
baggage
which
i
concede
should
be
search
carte
blanche,
eyes
glassy
or
under
the
influence,
numerous
things
like
that
that
indicate
an
objective
standard
rather
than
the
uncanny
feeling
that
a
customs
officer
had
and
they
have
about
a
person.
in
my
brief
i
raise
that
a
person
can
manifest
numerous
reasons
for
even
being
nervous:
a
late
babysitter,
a
tragic
accident
they
may
have
seen
in
mexico,
personal
problems
of
their
own.
yet,
nervousness
can’t
be
articulated
by
the
government
official.
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
i
would
probably
not
be
here
arguing
and
i
would
concede
to
your
honor
that
that
would
be
fair
enough.
that’s
why--
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
yes,
the
batting
average
there
is
500.
the
batting
average
in
this
case,
as
appears
by
the
government’s
own
brief
on
page
25,
4,811
people
were
searched
in
1969,
of
that,
3,500
were
proved
negative.
3,500
citizens
of
this
country
came
into
the
port
of
entry
at
san
ysidro,
were
told
to
get
naked,
absolutely
naked,
in
a
room
alone
with
a
stranger,
the
clothing
was
searched--
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
that
is
correct
and,
in
my
opinion,
that
is
not
good
enough.
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
i
don’t
find
that.
i
would
then
relate
to
the
balancing
the
interest.
i
think
if
such
an
incidence
of
50%
of
the
people
coming
into
the
country,
san
ysidro,
were
carriers
of
contraband,
then
i
would
have
to
yield
and
say
there
is
an
exception
engraphed
on
the
fourth
amendment
as
to
border
searches
in
this
day
and
age
when
such
a
thing
wasn’t
possible
100
years
ago,
and
i
would
concede
that
this
is
an
evil
that
must
be
stopped,
fourth
amendment
notwithstanding.
but,
now,
i
urge
the
reasonableness
of
the
amendment.
i
can’t
help
but
to
think
of
the
terry
court
when
we
talked
about
something
of
a
hip
slap
as
referred
to
where
a
gun
was
obtained
and
it
was
approved
but,
there,
officer
mccown,
in
working
the
streets
of
cleveland,
ohio,
articulated
12
trips
to
a
men’s
store
window
a
suspicious
conduct
of
some
several
hours,
whereas,
in
zebron,
plain
talking
to
a
bunch
of
narcotic
addicts
did
not
meet
the
standard.
again,
arguing
a
case
by
case
method,
a
case
by
case
basis
for
argument,
i
can
remember
trying
this
case
in
the
district
court.
i
can
remember
trying
the
genesis
of
usa
versus
henderson
where
judge
clinsol
in
the
district
court,
now
deceased,
made
a
footnote.
he
said,
in
his
many
years
at
san
ysidro,
he’s
come
to
believe
that
there
must
be
something
that
the
officer
can
tell
why
he
wants
that
woman
searched.
it
should
be
noted
in
this
case
that
the
co-companion,
jolene
harris,
was
without
contraband
and
i
note
four
or
five
times
in
this
case,
it’s
been
suggested
that
counsel
didn’t
cross-examine
the
officer.
i
can
answer
that
with
the
footnote
that
appears
in
zebron
that
the
moment
counsel
there
began
talking
about
the
weapon
he
swiftly
retreated
from
that
kind
of
cross-examination
and
i
did
state
i
wouldn’t
put
my
foot
into
it
at
that
time,
and
i
believe
it
was
the
government’s
burden,
as
i
do
now.
there’s
no
argument--
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
i
doubt
it
very
much
and
i
don’t
think
it
should
be
that
way
today.
a
vessel
that
is
a
carrier
of
notoriously
large
objects,
major
narcotics
is
brought
in,
in
vessels
and
ships
like
this.
i
think
that
the
law
as
to
vessels
and
things,
rather
than
a
person,
must
be--
receive
a
different
treatment.
here,
the
government
conceived
we’re
talking
about
the
second
of
a
tri-part
search
as
annunciated
by
the
ninth
circuit,
the
baggage
search,
one,
the
cavity
search,
three,
and
the
skin
search,
two.
and,
this
is
really
the
issue
and
only
the
issue
as
to
what,
if
anything,
is
needed
to
compel
a
woman
or
a
man,
as
the
case
may
be,
to
remove
their
clothing
and
get
naked.
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
no,
i
don’t.
not
if
the
inception
of
it
was
based
on
nothing
more
than
we
have
in
sandra
denise
johnson’s
case,
i
do
not.
which,
leads
me
to
an
argument
that
i
wish
to
raise
quickly
and
agent
mccown
has
27
years
experience
in
that
border
and
i
recall,
in
justice
jackson’s
dissent
in
briniger,
how
then
justice
jackson
referred
to
the
record
of
an
officer
that
all
he
wants
is
to
protect
that.
he
is
in
the
business,
the
competitive
business,
of
ferreting
out
crime
and
he
indicates
in
all
of
these
that
he
has
no
prejudices
that
he
has
no
cause
for
alarm
about
race
or
age
or
anything.
i
only
wish
to
suggest,
and
i
note
that
my
opponent
today
has
the
title
of
judge,
and
i
presume
that
that’s
because
mr.
pearce
is
probably
retired
but
as
a--
from
the
bench,
as
a
criminal
lawyer
in
13
years
and
asking
maybe
50
or
60
even
higher
men
a
question
that
i
used
to
ask
representing
mexican-americans
and
blacks,
i
ask
600
or
more,
“do
you
have
a
prejudice
against
the
defendant
because
of
his
raise
or
origin?”
and
i
never
once
got
an
affirmative
answer,
and
i
quit
asking
that
question
because
it
was
inconceivable
to
me
that
700
or
800
even
higher
men
wouldn’t
hold
a
prejudice.
so,
when
the
customs
agent
indicates,
as
he
is
supposed
to
in
cross-examination,
he
has
no
such
feelings,
may
i
suggest
that
all
of
us
carry
something
with
us
as
a
police
officer.
i
rent
space
to
an
ex-police
officer
and
i’ve
had
the
occasion
to
eavesdrop
on
his
conversations
with
fellow
policemen,
and
they’re
appalling.
they’re
startling,
and
i
could
imagine
some
of
the
conversations
that
may
take
place
here
and,
though
they
would
never
appear
on
record
and
perhaps
i’m
arguing
dehorns
the
record,
but
these
are
considerations
on
what
goes
into
an
encode
hunch
when
a
customs
officer
compels
a
lady
on
nothing
he
can
tell
us,
his
answer
in
the
companion
case
here
in
br--
in
coercy
civil
was
“i
had
an
uncanny
feeling.
that’s
all
i
can
tell
you.”
the
ninth
circuit--
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
i
concur
totally.
that’s
empirical
objective
based
facts,
but
the
government
concedes
here
that
they
do
not
know
what
other
symptoms,
if
any,
what--
whether
it
was
more
than
a
mere
suspicion
that
caused
4,811
citizens
in
1969
to
be
made
naked.
and,
until
we
know
that
balance
sheet,
until
we
can
see
their
batting
average,
i
think
my
point
is
well
taken
but--
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
1,311.
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
something,
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
it
suggests
that
we
have
a
problem
in
the
country.
it
suggests
an
insipid
amount
of
smuggling
of
heroin.
it
does
not,
however,
permit
me
to
allow
myself
the
im--
premature
of
the
fourth
amendment
to
condone
this
kind
of
conduct.
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
i
do
not,
your
honor.
i
do
not.
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
i
feel
that,
as
mr.
chief
justice
suggested,
that
when
one
brings
in
objects,
he
should
well
anticipate
if
he
wants
to
enjoy
the
freedom
of
our
soil,
that
that
should
be
looked
at.
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
it
can
be,
yes.
i
appreciate
that.
i
appreciate
that’s
a
problem,
but
i
think,
in
the
effects
of
the
person,
the
effects
as
indicated
in
the
fourth
amendment,
that
does
have
a
different
status
rather
than
the
person.
i
think
that,
at
no
time
in
our
history
of
our
country,
was
it
imagined
or
expected
when
the
fourth
amendment
was
enacted
or
through
all
this
court’s
great
history
that
it
was
thought
that
people
would
ever
have
to
be
made
naked
and
now
we
find
that
such
a
right
can
exist
and
should
exist
with
the
advent
of
personal
carrying
of
narcotics,
but
the
fourth
amendment
is
the
overseer
of
that
right
and
it
should
be
as
the
ninth
circuit
said
in
suppressing
the
evidence
of
the
district
court
on
an
objective
articulable
basis,
a
real
suspicion
directed
at
this
person,
something
that
has
scope
to
the
search.
and,
my
final
argument
is
simply
that
there
was
a
piece
of
literature
by
maxwell
anderson
not
too
many
years
ago
where
there
was
a
character
in
there
called
judge
gantu,
ran
around
after
making
a
very
bad
ruling
testing
his
own
ruling.
i’ve
played
devil’s
advocated
in
this
case
and
i
have
tested
the
proposition
on
district
attorneys
and
us
attorneys
and
ladies
and
men
and
fellow
citizens
alike.
and,
the
overwhelming
reaction
that
i
have
received
is
before
a
citizen
should
be
made
naked,
it
should
be
on
an
objective
basis.
i
ask
the
court
of
appeals
decision
to
be
affirmed
in
suppressing
the
evidence.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
may
please
the
court,
i
have
had
an
extremely
difficult
last
few
moments
in
beginning
my
argument
because
i’ve
heard
some
of
the
inquiries
presented
by
this
honorable
court
to
my
opponent,
the
petitioner.
and,
rather
than
reply
directly
to
any
of
the
petitioner’s
argument,
i
think
i
have
elected
and
will
do
and
proceed
to
what
i
believe
to
be
the
gravamen
of
this
case,
i
believe
to
be
the
critical
issue
here,
it’s
been
raised
by
your
honorable
court
already
this
morning,
and
go
on
to
some
concluding
remarks.
first
and
foremost,
when
congress
enacted
the
laws,
border
search
law
on
vessels
and
travelers,
it
cannot
be
imagined
they
had
in
those
days
even
a
remote
thought
that
a
party
coming
into
this
country
might
be
made
naked
at
a
port
of
entry
so
their
body
could
even
be
looked
at.
when
the
government
here
in
frames
the
issue
that
the
reason
a
person
is
told
to
get
nude
is
to
look
at
their
clothing,
that’s
true.
that
is
incidental
to
their
remaining
naked
in
a
room,
as
appears
in
the
government’s
brief,
perhaps
15
minutes
while
the
custom
inspector
looks
over
these
clothes.
in
this
day
and
age,
when
every
travel
agency,
when
every
port,
when
every
hotel
suggest
that
our
country
travel,
when
travel
is
permitted
to
even
the
poor
and
the
modest
people
for
a
day
in
canada
or
a
trip
shopping
in
nogales,
arizona
or,
as
is
correct,
san
ysidro,
california,
it
cannot
be
in
the
reasonable
expectation
of
the
public.
it
cannot
be
understandable
to
the
public
in
terms
that
they
can
know
that,
by
crossing
this
border,
upon
returning
to
this
country
or
as
an
associate
in
the
offices
coming
home,
they’ll
be
told
on
the
mere
suspicion
of
an
officer
“all
be
it
27
years
or
1
year
to
go
into
a
private
room
and
remove
your
clothing--
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
no,
i
do
not.
i
think
the--
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
i
think
the
difference
is
two-fold.
one,
in
balancing
the
interest,
as
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
mentioned
this
morning,
the
search
of
the
briefcase.
in
this
day
and
age,
when
there
are
things
to
be
concerned
with,
it’s
a
minor
intrusion
that
i
open
my
attaché
case
this
morning.
it’s
a
minor
intrusion.
in
the
courts
of
los
angeles,
it’s
the
same
intrusion
and,
to
enjoy
the
practice
of
my
profession,
i
will
submit
to
that.
but,
to
balance
coming
back
into
the
country
after
a
day
to
be
told
to
get
naked,
i
don’t
think
is
a
fair
analogy.
the
privacy
that
your
honor
refers
to
in
a
doctor’s
office
cannot
be
equated,
and
i
might
add
there
are
many
people
in
this
day
and
age
that
may
not
be
considered
puritanical
that
do
object
to
removing
all
of
their
clothing
in
a
doctor’s
office.
teenagers,
for
example,
even
old
women
who
had
their
first
illness
don’t
like
to
get
naked
at
a
doctor’s
office,
but
is
that
anticipated
upon
coming
back
to
the
country
that
one
stranger,
a
customs
officer,
all
be
it
experience,
has
that
power
on
an
encode,
hunch,
or
a
guess,
as
mr.
justice
marshall
mentioned
this
morning,
what
is
it?
can
it
be
telepathy?
can
it
be
skittish
behavior?
and
select
that
person
and
say
“you,
go
in
and
remove
your
clothing
for
a
search.”
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
i
have
two
answers.
i
think
both
of
them
cogent.
one,
appears
in
the
government’s
brief
that
they
concede
that
only
a
small
amount
of
narcotics
comes
into
the
country
through
the
body
cavity
or
carried
on
the
person.
second
of
all--
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
no,
i’m
talking,
your
honor,
in
underwear.
there’s
an
article
that
appears
in
march
29,
1971,
the
news
week
issue
and,
in
this
article,
they
talk
about
the
government’s
fight
against
the
white
death,
referring
of
course
to
heroine.
in
the
article,
they
refer
to
a
port
off
of
marsay
where
750
pounds
of
morphine
base,
the
ultimate
substance
that
is
used
to
make
heroine,
was
found
by
a
fisherman
accidentally.
they
waited
for
someone
to
pick
up
this
contraband
and,
low
and
behold,
they
captured
a
man
named
tuddy
yan,
a
notorious
narcotic
smuggler.
further
in
the
article
in
news
week,
they
reflect
that
from
the
capital
of
laos
in
vien
tien,
through
the
united
states
mail
to
saigon,
20
pounds
of
pure
heroin
were
received
by
a
suspect
there.
the
point
is
this.
that
we
will
not
stop
the
major
amount
of
smuggling
in
the
country
if
we
were
to
search
arbitrarily
15
out
of
15
and
if
a
few
ounces,
and
i
agree
it’s
insipid,
it’s
a
hideous
ailment,
i
am
a
criminal
practitioner
at
13
years
i’ve
dealt
with
it,
we
still
will
find
two
ounces,
we
will
find
three
ounces
of
the
major
amount
of
contraband
in
the
country.
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
i
would
s--
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
i
would
say
we
have
to
balance
the
interest
here.
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
no,
between
the
initiation
of
the
search
and
not
the
result.
i
think
that
if,
by
fortuitous,
a
customs
agent
got
lucky
and
found
50
ounces,
i
would
not
change
my
argument
to
say
that
he’s
search,
if
it
was
based
on
mere
suspicion
as
this
one
was,
was
any
better
at
the
outset.
i
would
feel
shegreen
that
50
ounces
of
heroin
came
into
the
country.
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
if
that
right
to
search
that
person
is
given,
it
should
be
based
on
an
articulable
objective
statement
that
the
officer
can
explain
to
the
trier
of
the
fact
that
why
he
wanted
that
person
stopped.
now,
the
customs
agents,
themselves,
it
was
asked
this
morning
of
counsel
for
the
government,
what
rules
do
customs
have
to
go
by?
and,
in
the
brief
of
the
government,
on
page
35,
there
begins
numerous
of
the
customs
rules
they
have
propagated
themselves.
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
yes,
that’s
a
lucky
meek
sheet,
mr.
justice,
where
they
have
had
a
history
of
experience
with
that
person
before.
it
is
referred
to
as
one
of
the
circumstances
objectively
to
stop
a
person
whether
or
not
they
appear
on
the
sound
desk.
that’s
an
easy
reference
spindle
where
they
find
a
person
has
been
there
once
before.
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
who
has
had
contraband
or
been
arrested
as
a
suspect.
some
of
the
other
things
indicated
in
the
customs
manual
which
was
not
followed
in
the
case
at
bar
are
hypodermic
outfits
found
in
the
baggage
which
i
concede
should
be
search
carte
blanche,
eyes
glassy
or
under
the
influence,
numerous
things
like
that
that
indicate
an
objective
standard
rather
than
the
uncanny
feeling
that
a
customs
officer
had
and
they
have
about
a
person.
in
my
brief
i
raise
that
a
person
can
manifest
numerous
reasons
for
even
being
nervous:
a
late
babysitter,
a
tragic
accident
they
may
have
seen
in
mexico,
personal
problems
of
their
own.
yet,
nervousness
can’t
be
articulated
by
the
government
official.
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
i
would
probably
not
be
here
arguing
and
i
would
concede
to
your
honor
that
that
would
be
fair
enough.
that’s
why--
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
yes,
the
batting
average
there
is
500.
the
batting
average
in
this
case,
as
appears
by
the
government’s
own
brief
on
page
25,
4,811
people
were
searched
in
1969,
of
that,
3,500
were
proved
negative.
3,500
citizens
of
this
country
came
into
the
port
of
entry
at
san
ysidro,
were
told
to
get
naked,
absolutely
naked,
in
a
room
alone
with
a
stranger,
the
clothing
was
searched--
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
that
is
correct
and,
in
my
opinion,
that
is
not
good
enough.
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
i
don’t
find
that.
i
would
then
relate
to
the
balancing
the
interest.
i
think
if
such
an
incidence
of
50%
of
the
people
coming
into
the
country,
san
ysidro,
were
carriers
of
contraband,
then
i
would
have
to
yield
and
say
there
is
an
exception
engraphed
on
the
fourth
amendment
as
to
border
searches
in
this
day
and
age
when
such
a
thing
wasn’t
possible
100
years
ago,
and
i
would
concede
that
this
is
an
evil
that
must
be
stopped,
fourth
amendment
notwithstanding.
but,
now,
i
urge
the
reasonableness
of
the
amendment.
i
can’t
help
but
to
think
of
the
terry
court
when
we
talked
about
something
of
a
hip
slap
as
referred
to
where
a
gun
was
obtained
and
it
was
approved
but,
there,
officer
mccown,
in
working
the
streets
of
cleveland,
ohio,
articulated
12
trips
to
a
men’s
store
window
a
suspicious
conduct
of
some
several
hours,
whereas,
in
zebron,
plain
talking
to
a
bunch
of
narcotic
addicts
did
not
meet
the
standard.
again,
arguing
a
case
by
case
method,
a
case
by
case
basis
for
argument,
i
can
remember
trying
this
case
in
the
district
court.
i
can
remember
trying
the
genesis
of
usa
versus
henderson
where
judge
clinsol
in
the
district
court,
now
deceased,
made
a
footnote.
he
said,
in
his
many
years
at
san
ysidro,
he’s
come
to
believe
that
there
must
be
something
that
the
officer
can
tell
why
he
wants
that
woman
searched.
it
should
be
noted
in
this
case
that
the
co-companion,
jolene
harris,
was
without
contraband
and
i
note
four
or
five
times
in
this
case,
it’s
been
suggested
that
counsel
didn’t
cross-examine
the
officer.
i
can
answer
that
with
the
footnote
that
appears
in
zebron
that
the
moment
counsel
there
began
talking
about
the
weapon
he
swiftly
retreated
from
that
kind
of
cross-examination
and
i
did
state
i
wouldn’t
put
my
foot
into
it
at
that
time,
and
i
believe
it
was
the
government’s
burden,
as
i
do
now.
there’s
no
argument--
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
i
doubt
it
very
much
and
i
don’t
think
it
should
be
that
way
today.
a
vessel
that
is
a
carrier
of
notoriously
large
objects,
major
narcotics
is
brought
in,
in
vessels
and
ships
like
this.
i
think
that
the
law
as
to
vessels
and
things,
rather
than
a
person,
must
be--
receive
a
different
treatment.
here,
the
government
conceived
we’re
talking
about
the
second
of
a
tri-part
search
as
annunciated
by
the
ninth
circuit,
the
baggage
search,
one,
the
cavity
search,
three,
and
the
skin
search,
two.
and,
this
is
really
the
issue
and
only
the
issue
as
to
what,
if
anything,
is
needed
to
compel
a
woman
or
a
man,
as
the
case
may
be,
to
remove
their
clothing
and
get
naked.
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
no,
i
don’t.
not
if
the
inception
of
it
was
based
on
nothing
more
than
we
have
in
sandra
denise
johnson’s
case,
i
do
not.
which,
leads
me
to
an
argument
that
i
wish
to
raise
quickly
and
agent
mccown
has
27
years
experience
in
that
border
and
i
recall,
in
justice
jackson’s
dissent
in
briniger,
how
then
justice
jackson
referred
to
the
record
of
an
officer
that
all
he
wants
is
to
protect
that.
he
is
in
the
business,
the
competitive
business,
of
ferreting
out
crime
and
he
indicates
in
all
of
these
that
he
has
no
prejudices
that
he
has
no
cause
for
alarm
about
race
or
age
or
anything.
i
only
wish
to
suggest,
and
i
note
that
my
opponent
today
has
the
title
of
judge,
and
i
presume
that
that’s
because
mr.
pearce
is
probably
retired
but
as
a--
from
the
bench,
as
a
criminal
lawyer
in
13
years
and
asking
maybe
50
or
60
even
higher
men
a
question
that
i
used
to
ask
representing
mexican-americans
and
blacks,
i
ask
600
or
more,
“do
you
have
a
prejudice
against
the
defendant
because
of
his
raise
or
origin?”
and
i
never
once
got
an
affirmative
answer,
and
i
quit
asking
that
question
because
it
was
inconceivable
to
me
that
700
or
800
even
higher
men
wouldn’t
hold
a
prejudice.
so,
when
the
customs
agent
indicates,
as
he
is
supposed
to
in
cross-examination,
he
has
no
such
feelings,
may
i
suggest
that
all
of
us
carry
something
with
us
as
a
police
officer.
i
rent
space
to
an
ex-police
officer
and
i’ve
had
the
occasion
to
eavesdrop
on
his
conversations
with
fellow
policemen,
and
they’re
appalling.
they’re
startling,
and
i
could
imagine
some
of
the
conversations
that
may
take
place
here
and,
though
they
would
never
appear
on
record
and
perhaps
i’m
arguing
dehorns
the
record,
but
these
are
considerations
on
what
goes
into
an
encode
hunch
when
a
customs
officer
compels
a
lady
on
nothing
he
can
tell
us,
his
answer
in
the
companion
case
here
in
br--
in
coercy
civil
was
“i
had
an
uncanny
feeling.
that’s
all
i
can
tell
you.”
the
ninth
circuit--
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
i
concur
totally.
that’s
empirical
objective
based
facts,
but
the
government
concedes
here
that
they
do
not
know
what
other
symptoms,
if
any,
what--
whether
it
was
more
than
a
mere
suspicion
that
caused
4,811
citizens
in
1969
to
be
made
naked.
and,
until
we
know
that
balance
sheet,
until
we
can
see
their
batting
average,
i
think
my
point
is
well
taken
but--
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
1,311.
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
something,
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
it
suggests
that
we
have
a
problem
in
the
country.
it
suggests
an
insipid
amount
of
smuggling
of
heroin.
it
does
not,
however,
permit
me
to
allow
myself
the
im--
premature
of
the
fourth
amendment
to
condone
this
kind
of
conduct.
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
i
do
not,
your
honor.
i
do
not.
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
i
feel
that,
as
mr.
chief
justice
suggested,
that
when
one
brings
in
objects,
he
should
well
anticipate
if
he
wants
to
enjoy
the
freedom
of
our
soil,
that
that
should
be
looked
at.
mr.
howard
e.
beckler
it
can
be,
yes.
i
appreciate
that.
i
appreciate
that’s
a
problem,
but
i
think,
in
the
effects
of
the
person,
the
effects
as
indicated
in
the
fourth
amendment,
that
does
have
a
different
status
rather
than
the
person.
i
think
that,
at
no
time
in
our
history
of
our
country,
was
it
imagined
or
expected
when
the
fourth
amendment
was
enacted
or
through
all
this
court’s
great
history
that
it
was
thought
that
people
would
ever
have
to
be
made
naked
and
now
we
find
that
such
a
right
can
exist
and
should
exist
with
the
advent
of
personal
carrying
of
narcotics,
but
the
fourth
amendment
is
the
overseer
of
that
right
and
it
should
be
as
the
ninth
circuit
said
in
suppressing
the
evidence
of
the
district
court
on
an
objective
articulable
basis,
a
real
suspicion
directed
at
this
person,
something
that
has
scope
to
the
search.
and,
my
final
argument
is
simply
that
there
was
a
piece
of
literature
by
maxwell
anderson
not
too
many
years
ago
where
there
was
a
character
in
there
called
judge
gantu,
ran
around
after
making
a
very
bad
ruling
testing
his
own
ruling.
i’ve
played
devil’s
advocated
in
this
case
and
i
have
tested
the
proposition
on
district
attorneys
and
us
attorneys
and
ladies
and
men
and
fellow
citizens
alike.
and,
the
overwhelming
reaction
that
i
have
received
is
before
a
citizen
should
be
made
naked,
it
should
be
on
an
objective
basis.
i
ask
the
court
of
appeals
decision
to
be
affirmed
in
suppressing
the
evidence.
thank
you
very
much.
