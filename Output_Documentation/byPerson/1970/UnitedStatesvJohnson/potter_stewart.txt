justice

stewart
at
the
customs.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
as
to
searching
baggage,
isn’t
there
an
unrestricted
absolute
right
in
inspecting
baggage?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
were
no
narcotic--
federal
narcotics
laws
in
1866,
were
there?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
there
were
not.
justice
potter
stewart
it
could
be
mere
intuition
based
on
experience?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
could
it
be
this
much?
somewhere,
i
think,
in
this
record
or
maybe
i
read
it
elsewhere
outside
the
record
that
this
particular
port
of
entry,
san
ysidro,
if
that’s--
i’m
pronouncing
it
correctly,
is
a
port
of
entry
where
a--
apparently,
a
great
deal
of
illegal
narcotics
are
smuggled
across
the
border.
maybe
to
the
extent,
let’s
assume,
to
the
extent
that
1
out
of
every
15
people
who
comes
across
the
border
at
that
particular
point
is
smuggling
narcotics.
could
the
service
just
decide
arbitrarily,
at
random,
to
have
a
personal
search
of
every
15th
person
who
comes
across?
justice
potter
stewart
because
there’s
a
chance
of
suspicion.
justice
potter
stewart
if
my
hypothesized
facts
are
correct,
there’s
1
chance
in
15
that
every--
as
to
each
person
who
comes
across
the
border,
that
he’s
smuggling
narcotics
and
that’s
enough
for
a
suspicion,
i
suppose,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
if
there’s
1
chance
out
of
every
15,
just
statistically,
then
isn’t
that
a
ground
for
suspicion
with
respect
to
each
person
who
comes
across
the
border?
justice
potter
stewart
or
with
respect
to
checking
on
income
tax
returns
and
so
on.
these
are
arbitrary
random
samples,
as
i
so
understand.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
it’s
known
that
1
out
of
every
50
persons
is
likely
to
either
cheat
or
make
serious
mistakes
in
his
income
tax
returns,
one
way
to
get
at
it
when
you
can’t
look
at
all
the
returns
is
to
randomly
check
1
out
of
every
50
with
the
suspicion
that
you’ll
perhaps
find
either
fraud
or
gross
error.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
would
think--
i
just
merely
suggest
that
it
could
be
argued
that
if
the
customs
officer
has
knowledge,
statistically,
based
on
his
experience
that
at
that
particular
point
of
entry
that
1
out
of
every
15
people
is
a
smuggler,
then
isn’t
the
1
chance
out
of
15
enough
to
suspect
each
person
who
comes
in
there?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
as
far
as
examination
of
baggage
is
concerned,
there
aren’t
any
routine
test
and
inspection,
which
all
of
us
are
going
through,
there’s
not
any
statutory
authorities,
wouldn’t
you
say?
justice
potter
stewart
has
anybody
ever
challenged
it?
justice
potter
stewart
106?
justice
potter
stewart
in
what
way
do
you
give
to
what
is
almost
a
matter
of
judicial
notice?
at
least
we
see
it
coming
across
our
desks
in
these
records
all
the
time.
what
are
the
ways
in
which
substantial

of

are
