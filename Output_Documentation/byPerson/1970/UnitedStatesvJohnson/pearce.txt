mr.
pearce
alright,
surely.
mr.
pearce
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices,
this
case
involves
a
custom
search.
the
respondent
sandra
denise
johnson,
whom
i
shall
occasionally
refer
to
as
the
defendant,
was
convicted
by
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
california
of
illegally
concealing
and
transporting
narcotics
into
the
united
states.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit,
with
one
judge
dissenting,
reversed
the
district
court.
the
case
is
here
on
certiorari.
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
judgment
of
a
customs
inspector
based
on
suspicion
in
the
light
of
his
experience
without
more,
his
sufficient
basis
to
require
an
individual
seeking
to
enter
the
united
states
to
disrobe
in
private
so
that
his
or
her
clothing
may
be
searched
for
contraband.
mr.
pearce
heroine,
your
honor.
mr.
pearce
two
ounce--
five
ounce--
two
ounces,
i
believe.
the
principle
constitutional
and
statutory
provisions
involve
the
fourth
amendment
and
sections
482
and
1582
of
title
19
of
the
united
states
code.
there
are
set
forth
in
the
government’s
brief
at
pages
2
and
3.
the
facts
upon
which
this
appeal
is
based
are
these.
on
sunday,
august
18,
1968,
sandra
denise
johnson
and
a
female
traveling
companion,
one
jolene
harris,
crossed
the
mexican-american
border
on
foot
at
san
ysidro,
california.
inspector
mccown,
who
at
that
time
had
27
years
experience
as
a
customs
inspector
at
that
port
of
entry,
san
ysidro,
observed
ms.
johnson
and
her
companion
and
questioned
them.
he
thereupon
became
suspicious
that
they
were
carrying
contraband,
so
he
arranged
for
a
personal
search
to
be
conducted
by
a
female
inspector
so
that
their
clothes
could
be
thoroughly
searched.
this
type
of
search
is
frequently
referred
to
as
a
strip
search.
the
search
in
this
case
was
conducted
by
mrs.
netta
lohman.
she
searched
each
of
the
women
separately
in
a
secondary
search
room
which
was
a
completely
closed
private
room
with
no
windows.
each
of
the
women
was
asked
to
please
remove
all
of
her
clothing
and
hand
them
to
mrs.
lohman.
mrs.
lohman’s
search
of
the
respondent’s
clothing
disclosed
two
bundles
in
the
seat
of
her
underpants.
one
bundle
contained
two
ounces
of
heroine,
the
other
librium
and
unidentified
capsules.
no
contraband
was
found
in
ms.
harris’
clothes
and
the
women’s
bodies
were
neither
searched
nor
touched.
in
the
district
court,
a
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence
was
made
on
behalf
of
the
defendant
johnson.
defense
counsel
agreed
with
the
district
court
that
the
defendant
had
the
burden
of
proving
the
motion.
the
defendant
did
not
produce
any
witnesses
or
other
evidence
in
support
of
the
motion.
at
the
hearing,
the
government
attorney
called
inspectors
mccown
and
lohman
as
witnesses.
inspector
mccown
testified
that
after
he
saw
and
talked
with
the
defendant
and
her
traveling
companion,
he
became
suspicious
and
arranged
for
them
to
be
personally
searched.
he
was
not
asked
and
he
did
not
state
any
other
reasons
as
to
why
he
became
suspicious.
mrs.
lohman
testified
as
to
the
method
and
conditions
of
the
search
and
what
it
revealed.
defense
counsel--
mr.
pearce
at
the
port
of
entry,
yes,
sir.
mr.
pearce
at
the
customs.
defense
counsel
cross-examined
mrs.
lohman
but
did
not
cross-examine
inspector
mccown,
stating
by
way
of
explanation
that
the
government
had
to
prove
something
more
than
mere
suspicion,
and
he
said
“he
wasn’t
about
to
put
his
foot
into
it.”
defense
counsel,
in
essence,
argued
that
a
strip
search
was
invalid
under
the
fourth
amendment
in
the
absence
of
an
affirmative
showing
of
objective
grounds
for
reason--
for
real
suspicion.
the
government
attorney
relied
on
the
ninth
circuit’s
case
of
witt
v.
united
states
where
a
strip
search
reveal
narcotics
concealed
in
the
defendant’s
brassier
and
was
upheld
on
that
basis,
on
a
basis
that
mere
suspicion
was
enough
to
justify
such
a
search.
the
trial
court
denied
the
motion
to
suppress
and
rejected
the
defense
claim
that
it
was
the
government’
burden
to
establish,
on
a
motion
to
suppress,
reasons
for
inspector
mccown’s
suspicion.
the
case
was
tried
without
a
jury
on
a
basis
of
the
testimony
of
the
two
inspectors
in
certain
stipulations.
the
court
found
for
the
defendant--
found
for
the--
found
the
defendant
guilty,
and
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
holding
that
the
trial
court’s
ruling
on
a
motion
was
erroneous
in
the
light
of
that
court’s,
that’s
the
ninth
circuit’s
court
decision
in
united
states
v.
guadalupe-garza.
and,
although
the
guadalupe-garza
case
involved
a
cavity
as
opposed
to
a
strip
search,
the
ninth
circuit
did
define
for
the
first
time
in
that
opinion
the
requirements
“real
suspicion.
”the
court
said
that
a
strip
search
cannot
be
conducted
on
mere
suspicion
that
something
more
was
necessary
and
there’s
a
merit
to
real
suspicion.
it
defined
the
term
“real
suspicion”
as
follows.
real
suspicion,
justifying
the
initiation
of
a
strip
search,
is
subjective
suspicion
supported
by
objective
articulable
facts
which
reasonably
lead
an
experienced
prudent
customs
officer
to
suspect
that
a
particular
person
seeking
to
cross
our
border
is
concealing
something
on
his
body
for
the
purpose
of
transporting
it
into
the
united
states
contrary
to
law.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
search
in
the
instant
case
did
not
meet
this
standard
since
the
government
did
not
prove
that
there
were
objective
articulable
facts
to
support
the
inspector’s
suspicion.
the
dissenting
judge
was
of
the
view
that
garza
was
distinguishable
since
it
dealt
with
cavity--
with
a
cavity
search
which
required
a
more
stringent
standard
than
a
simple
inspection
of
clothing.
in
his
view,
the
case
was
on
“all
fours”
with
witt
v.
united
states
which
had
approved
a
personal
search.
parenthetically,
the
garza
case
was
decided
on
february
2,
1970
which
was
more
than
9
months
after
the
district
court
had
decided
the
instant
case.
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed
for
at
least
three
reasons.
first,
the
statutory
authority
for
a
customs
inspector
to
conduct
a
personal
search
on
a
basis
of
suspicion
is
clear
and
unequivocal.
second,
the
great
public
need
to
stop
the
huge
inflow
of
contraband,
particularly
narcotics,
into
this
country
demands
that
the
balancing
of
the
governmental
interest
in
inspection
against
the
traveler’s
interest
in
minimizing
inconvenience
7and
embarrassment
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
government.
and,
third,
that
the
ninth
circuit’s
objective
articulable
facts
test
is
an
impractical
and
unworkable
one.
now,
the
statute
in
question,
19
usc
482
clearly
states
that
a
customs
officer
may
search
any
person
on
whom
he
shall
suspect
there
is
contraband.
congress
used
a
simple
word,
“suspect.”
they
did
not
qualify
it.
they
did
not
use
real
suspicion,
actual
suspicion.
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
congress
meant
what
it
said.
simply,
that
a
person--
that
a
personal
search
may
be
conducted
solely
on
suspicion
and
if
they
want--
meant
otherwise,
we
think
they
would’ve
stated
because,
in
this
statute,
this
very
statute,
482,
they
set
up
two
different
standards
of
suspicion,
one,
suspicion
that
we’ve
been
talking
about
with
respect
to
the
person,
and
then
another
standard
that
relates
to
trunks
or
envelops.
in
that
statute,
it
says
that
a
customs
inspector
may
search
any
trunk
or
envelop
wherever
found
in
which
he
may
have
a
reasonable
cause
to
suspect
there
is
merchandise
which
was
imported
contrary
to
law,
which
means
that
the
congress
was
well-aware
of
the
words
that
it
was
using.
now,
this
statute
is
a
very
old
one,
over
150
years
in
age.
it
dates
back
to
1815
when
it
was
first
enacted
and,
at
that
time,
they
had
the
mere
suspicion
test
in
the
statute.
in
fact,
it
was
an
extension
of
an
even
older
statute
going
back
to
the
first
congress
of
the
united
states.
mr.
pearce
as
it
comes
over
the
border,
yes,
sir,
but
you’ll
notice
that
this
part
of
the
statute
says
“wherever
found.”
mr.
pearce
which
means
that
it
would
go
beyond
the
borders
and
they
could
trace
the
baggage
into
the
interior
and,
therefore,
i
think
they’re
one
of
the
higher
standards,
once
this
baggage
got
into
the
interior.
mr.
pearce
no.
this
is
the--
mr.
pearce
this
is
the
only
one.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
judge,
i
think
the
courts
have
said
that
not
even
suspicion
is
necessary
because
people
come
through
a
baggage
line
and
just
one
after
another
is
taken,
and
you
search
it,
and--
but,
there
is
act--
mr.
pearce
there
is
no
statute
that
says--
mr.
pearce
except
this
one,
yes,
that’s
it.
mr.
pearce
that’s
right.
that’s
what
it
says.
now,
in
the
18--
in
1815,
when
this
statute
was
first
enacted
and
it
contained
this
provision,
i
believe
that
because
of
the
kinds
of
contraband
that
existed
at
that
time
congress
must
have
thought
that
occasion
could
arise
when
a
person
would
have
to
be
stripped
in
order
to
search
that
clothing
for
contraband.
but
if
there
is
any
question
about
that,
congress
laid
it
to
rest
in
1866
because
congress
re-enacted
this
law
in
1866
and
added
a
provision,
a
provision
which
provided
that
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
could
employ
female
inspectors
for
the
purpose
of
examining
and
searching
person
of
their
own
sex,
which
means
that
they
anticipated
that
there
would
be
these
kinds
of
personal
searches.
now,
at
this
point,
i’d
like
to
draw
a
distinction
between
the
strict--
strip
search
that
i’ve
been
talking
about
and
the
cavity
search.
we
well
realize
that
people
may
argue
that
this
statute
does
not
apply
to
a
cavity
search
because
the
last
time
that
the
congress
enacted
this
law
was
in
1866
and,
at
that
time,
carrying
contraband
in
the
cavities
of
the
body
certainly
would
not
invoke
and,
furthermore,
medical
science
had
not
developed
to
the
extent
that
somebody
could
take
some
contraband,
put
it
in
the
stomach,
later
regurgitate
it
and
still
use
it.
so--
mr.
pearce
i
don’t
believe
so.
mr.
pearce
i
don’t
believe
so.
so,
we
distinguished
between
the
two,
a
strip
search
on
the
one
hand,
a
cavity
search
on
the
other.
we
certainly
believe
that
as
far
as
the
strip
search
is
concerned,
certainly,
the
law
goes
that
far
and
does
intend
to
include
the
strip
search.
mr.
pearce
i
am
putting
it
in
the
same
category
as
being
able--
as
the
statute
says
that
a
person
is
able
to
be
searched
upon
suspicion.
i’m
just--
that’s
what
the
law--
those
were
the
literal
words
of
the
statute
and
i’m
saying
that
the
statue
means
exactly
what
it
said.
mr.
pearce
well,
some
of
the
courts
seem
to
extend--
seem
to
think
there
is.
they
seem
to
point
out
that
congress
doesn’t
mean
suspicion
in
the
ordinary
sense.
they
mean
real
suspicion,
and
then
it
goes
on--
that’s
the
ninth
circuit
goes
on
to
define
what
they
think
real
suspicion
is.
i
say
that
congress,
by
its
history
of
this--
by
the
history
of
this
statute,
means
just
exactly
what
it
says.
it’s
a
simple
word,
meaning
that
if
an
officer
has
a
suspicion,
he
has
the
right
to
make
a
personal
search
and--
mr.
pearce
suspicion
means,
an
uncertainty
about
something
or
i
should
say,
exactly--
i
could
tell
you
exactly
what
it
is
because
i
happen
to
have
written
it
down,
but
i
don’t
have
it
right
handy
but,
to
me,
it
means
that
a
person
believes
that
there
is
something
wrong
on
the
basis
of
little
or
no
evidence.
mr.
pearce
it
could
be
any--
it
could
be
one
of
many
things,
anything.
shifty
eyes,
it
could
be
nervousness,
it
could
be
the
way
they
sweat,
it
could
be
almost
anything.
it
could
be
a--
suspicion,
to
me,
is
a--
simply
that
you
do
not
have
act--
you
do
not
have
proof
that
something
is
wrong,
but
you
believe
something
is
wrong.
mr.
pearce
well,
there
is--
it’s--
that’s
true.
there
is
uncertainty
in
that
because
you
are
not
sure.
you
believe
that
there
is
something
wrong,
but
you’re
not
absolutely
certain
because
you
don’t
have
absolute
proof.
you
have
little
or
no
proof.
i
believe
that’s
the
way
the
dictionary
defines
it.
mr.
pearce
well,
i
don’t
know
how
far
mental
telepathy
goes,
judge,
but
i
would
think
that--
mr.
pearce
the
suspicion
that
we’re
talking
about
with
respect
to
these
custom
agents
is
the
suspicions
that
they
get
through
their
experience,
long
experience,
of
having
looked
at
thousands
and
thousands
of
people
come
through
that
line.
mr.
pearce
well,
that
is
the
standard
that
has
been
used
and
is
exactly
what
is
meant
when
you
apply
the
term
“suspicion
to
a
customs
officer”
as
opposed
to
just
the
word
“suspicion.”
mr.
pearce
yes.
mr.
pearce
i
don’t
believe
this--
the
service
could
or
would
do
that.
mr.
pearce
but
i
do
think
that
congress--
mr.
pearce
well,
you
could
argue
that,
but
i
rather
think
that
it
would
be
better
for
the
congress
to
review
the
entire
situation
and
then
set
some
rules
that
1
out
of
every
15
people
can
be
searched.
mr.
pearce
it
would
be
a
ground--
in
fact,
it’s
the
ground
i
imagine
that
is
used
with
respect
to
baggage.
that’s
why
they
search
every
single
person’s
baggage.
they
don’t
have
any
suspicion--
mr.
pearce
but
that’s
so
much
suspicion
as
it
is
a
random
sample.
mr.
pearce
but
i
think
that
the
statute
here,
the
statute
here
relates
to
a
customs
officer.
he
must
have
the
suspicion.
in
fact,
there
had
been
cases
where
when
a
custom
officer
himself
did
not
have
a
suspicion,
the
court
ruled
that
the
search
was
not
proper.
mr.
pearce
it
could
be
argued.
mr.
pearce
i
would
think
that
if
congress
looked
into
the
matter,
held
hearings,
and
found
out
that
the
incidence
of
smuggling
was
so
great
that
they
could
pass
such
a
statute
because
they
have
the
basic
responsibility
for
controlling
foreign
commerce
and
what
is
imported
into
united
states,
i
think
if
they
could
make
a
case
for
this,
that
that
could
be
allowed
if
they
wanted
to
pass
such
legislation.
mr.
pearce
well,
i
think--
mr.
pearce
frankly,
mr.
justice,
that
the
congress
would
probably
be
in
a
better
position
by
holding
hearings
and
being
able
to
get
so
much
more
information
than
a
court
could
get
in
a
case
by
case
basis,
that
it
would
be
a
better
way
of
doing
it.
yes,
sir?
mr.
pearce
well,
i
would
think
the
fourth
amendment
has
grounded
reasonableness
and
if
it
could
be
shown
that
we
were
in
such
a
difficult
position
as--
it’s
highly
theoretical
because
i
don’t
think
it
would
ever
happen,
but
if
it
were--
if
the
congress
was
able
to
show
that
we
were--
that
almost
every
person
was
smuggling
into
this
country,
then
i
think
that
they
could
go
as
far
as
passing
a
law
to
that
effect.
mr.
pearce
that
is
true.
mr.
pearce
no.
mr.
pearce
would
the
argument
be
the
same?
mr.
pearce
no,
sir.
mr.
pearce
it
doesn’t
say
he
has
to
have
any
experience
at
all,
but
i
would
think
that
if
it
had
happened
with
somebody
with
three
days
on
duty,
first
of
all,
i
don’t
think
it
could
possibly
happen,
mr.
justice,
because,
you
see,
he
would
probably
go
to
his
superior
who
would
then
not
allow
him--
not
allow
it
to
be
done.
but,
if
he
did
do
it--
mr.
pearce
no,
the
statute
doesn’t
require
that.
no.
mr.
pearce
no.
mr.
pearce
what--
mr.
pearce
it’s
what
he--
yes,
he’s
told
that--
he
is
given
a
manual.
mr.
pearce
we
have
a
manual,
sir.
mr.
pearce
it
does
not
say
precisely
what
suspicion
is,
no.
mr.
pearce
it
says--
yes.
mr.
pearce
it
says
that
you--
that
the
agent
has
a
very
significant
power
and
that’s
the
power
to
have
some--
have
personal
searches
made
upon
suspicion
and
that
he
should
use
that
power
very
wisely,
and
they
gave
various
illustrations
that
would
show
him
how
to
use
the
power,
but
it’s
not
a--
completely
comprehensive.
it
doesn’t
cover
every
possible
circumstance.
mr.
pearce
and
he
also
goes
to
school
and
he’s
taught
further
there
and
he
also
has--
there
is
very
close
supervision
in
the
custom
service.
mr.
pearce
well,
he’s
told
in
classes
as
to
what
the
nature
of
suspicion
is,
yes.
mr.
pearce
yes,
upon
his
suspicion.
mr.
pearce
any
person
from
anywhere.
mr.
pearce
american
citizens,
yes,
sir.
mr.
pearce
well,
of
course--
mr.
pearce
well,
the
courts
have
said
that
for
a
long
time,
saying
that
the
border
search
is
other
than
other
kinds
of
search
because
a
country
has
the
right
to
set
the
terms
and
conditions
for
people
entering
the
country
and
so
it’s
not
the
same
as
a
search
in
the
interior.
mr.
pearce
no,
i
do
not
know
of
any
such--
mr.
pearce
yes,
sir.
well
to
continue,
sir,
until
recently,
the
ninth
circuit--
until
the
recent
ninth
circuit
cases,
the
courts
have
generally
agreed
that
a
personal
search
could
be
made
on
mere
suspicion
at
the
border
without
violating
the
fourth
amendment.
in
short,
they
followed
the
clear
language
of
the
statute,
and
this
was
true
even
in
the
ninth
circuit,
and
i
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
case,
particularly,
of
bible
v.
united
states
which
is
not
in
our
brief
but
which
i
came
across
during
the
time
i
was
preparing
for
argument,
314
fed.
2nd
106
decided
in
1963.
there,
a
person
appeared
to
be
nervous
has
led
to
a
strip
search
and
the
discovery
of
heroine
and
the
court
held
that
mere
suspicion
was
enough
to
justify
such
a
search.
mr.
pearce
yes,
106.
mr.
pearce
yes,
sir,
and
certiorari
was
denied
by
this
court
and,
in
that
case,
they
cited
the
witt
versus
united
states
case
which
had
reached
a
similar
conclusion.
mr.
pearce
no,
sir.
the
fourth
amendment
does
apply
to
board
of
searches.
it
definitely
does
but
congress,
as
far
back
as
1979,
made
a
distinction
between
this
search
and
other
kinds
of
search
and
they
passed
a
law
allowing
vessels
to
be
searched
solely
on
the
basis
of
suspicion
and
then
this
statute
is
really
an
extension
of
that
statute.
mr.
pearce
the
clear
indication
test
of
the
court
of
appeals?
i
would
say
that
there
should
be
something
more
for
a
cavity
search.
i
think
that
what
you’re
talking
about
is
a
balancing
of
things
and
the--
as
a
matter
of
degree,
that
there
should
be
more
for
a
cavity
search.
this
kind
of
search
just
requires
somebody
to
take
off
his
clothes
and
hand
the
clothes
to
somebody
so
the
clothes
can
be
searched
and
then
given
back.
a
cavity
search
touches
the
body,
intrudes
upon
the
body
and
i
think
a
higher
degree
of
standard,
a
higher
standard,
is
necessary.
as
i
explained
before,
i
don’t
think
the
congress
considered
this
because
the
last
time
it
enacted
that
statute
was
1866.
mr.
pearce
okay.
mr.
pearce
alright,
surely.
mr.
pearce
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices,
this
case
involves
a
custom
search.
the
respondent
sandra
denise
johnson,
whom
i
shall
occasionally
refer
to
as
the
defendant,
was
convicted
by
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
california
of
illegally
concealing
and
transporting
narcotics
into
the
united
states.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit,
with
one
judge
dissenting,
reversed
the
district
court.
the
case
is
here
on
certiorari.
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
judgment
of
a
customs
inspector
based
on
suspicion
in
the
light
of
his
experience
without
more,
his
sufficient
basis
to
require
an
individual
seeking
to
enter
the
united
states
to
disrobe
in
private
so
that
his
or
her
clothing
may
be
searched
for
contraband.
mr.
pearce
heroine,
your
honor.
mr.
pearce
two
ounce--
five
ounce--
two
ounces,
i
believe.
the
principle
constitutional
and
statutory
provisions
involve
the
fourth
amendment
and
sections
482
and
1582
of
title
19
of
the
united
states
code.
there
are
set
forth
in
the
government’s
brief
at
pages
2
and
3.
the
facts
upon
which
this
appeal
is
based
are
these.
on
sunday,
august
18,
1968,
sandra
denise
johnson
and
a
female
traveling
companion,
one
jolene
harris,
crossed
the
mexican-american
border
on
foot
at
san
ysidro,
california.
inspector
mccown,
who
at
that
time
had
27
years
experience
as
a
customs
inspector
at
that
port
of
entry,
san
ysidro,
observed
ms.
johnson
and
her
companion
and
questioned
them.
he
thereupon
became
suspicious
that
they
were
carrying
contraband,
so
he
arranged
for
a
personal
search
to
be
conducted
by
a
female
inspector
so
that
their
clothes
could
be
thoroughly
searched.
this
type
of
search
is
frequently
referred
to
as
a
strip
search.
the
search
in
this
case
was
conducted
by
mrs.
netta
lohman.
she
searched
each
of
the
women
separately
in
a
secondary
search
room
which
was
a
completely
closed
private
room
with
no
windows.
each
of
the
women
was
asked
to
please
remove
all
of
her
clothing
and
hand
them
to
mrs.
lohman.
mrs.
lohman’s
search
of
the
respondent’s
clothing
disclosed
two
bundles
in
the
seat
of
her
underpants.
one
bundle
contained
two
ounces
of
heroine,
the
other
librium
and
unidentified
capsules.
no
contraband
was
found
in
ms.
harris’
clothes
and
the
women’s
bodies
were
neither
searched
nor
touched.
in
the
district
court,
a
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence
was
made
on
behalf
of
the
defendant
johnson.
defense
counsel
agreed
with
the
district
court
that
the
defendant
had
the
burden
of
proving
the
motion.
the
defendant
did
not
produce
any
witnesses
or
other
evidence
in
support
of
the
motion.
at
the
hearing,
the
government
attorney
called
inspectors
mccown
and
lohman
as
witnesses.
inspector
mccown
testified
that
after
he
saw
and
talked
with
the
defendant
and
her
traveling
companion,
he
became
suspicious
and
arranged
for
them
to
be
personally
searched.
he
was
not
asked
and
he
did
not
state
any
other
reasons
as
to
why
he
became
suspicious.
mrs.
lohman
testified
as
to
the
method
and
conditions
of
the
search
and
what
it
revealed.
defense
counsel--
mr.
pearce
at
the
port
of
entry,
yes,
sir.
mr.
pearce
at
the
customs.
defense
counsel
cross-examined
mrs.
lohman
but
did
not
cross-examine
inspector
mccown,
stating
by
way
of
explanation
that
the
government
had
to
prove
something
more
than
mere
suspicion,
and
he
said
“he
wasn’t
about
to
put
his
foot
into
it.”
defense
counsel,
in
essence,
argued
that
a
strip
search
was
invalid
under
the
fourth
amendment
in
the
absence
of
an
affirmative
showing
of
objective
grounds
for
reason--
for
real
suspicion.
the
government
attorney
relied
on
the
ninth
circuit’s
case
of
witt
v.
united
states
where
a
strip
search
reveal
narcotics
concealed
in
the
defendant’s
brassier
and
was
upheld
on
that
basis,
on
a
basis
that
mere
suspicion
was
enough
to
justify
such
a
search.
the
trial
court
denied
the
motion
to
suppress
and
rejected
the
defense
claim
that
it
was
the
government’
burden
to
establish,
on
a
motion
to
suppress,
reasons
for
inspector
mccown’s
suspicion.
the
case
was
tried
without
a
jury
on
a
basis
of
the
testimony
of
the
two
inspectors
in
certain
stipulations.
the
court
found
for
the
defendant--
found
for
the--
found
the
defendant
guilty,
and
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
holding
that
the
trial
court’s
ruling
on
a
motion
was
erroneous
in
the
light
of
that
court’s,
that’s
the
ninth
circuit’s
court
decision
in
united
states
v.
guadalupe-garza.
and,
although
the
guadalupe-garza
case
involved
a
cavity
as
opposed
to
a
strip
search,
the
ninth
circuit
did
define
for
the
first
time
in
that
opinion
the
requirements
“real
suspicion.
”the
court
said
that
a
strip
search
cannot
be
conducted
on
mere
suspicion
that
something
more
was
necessary
and
there’s
a
merit
to
real
suspicion.
it
defined
the
term
“real
suspicion”
as
follows.
real
suspicion,
justifying
the
initiation
of
a
strip
search,
is
subjective
suspicion
supported
by
objective
articulable
facts
which
reasonably
lead
an
experienced
prudent
customs
officer
to
suspect
that
a
particular
person
seeking
to
cross
our
border
is
concealing
something
on
his
body
for
the
purpose
of
transporting
it
into
the
united
states
contrary
to
law.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
search
in
the
instant
case
did
not
meet
this
standard
since
the
government
did
not
prove
that
there
were
objective
articulable
facts
to
support
the
inspector’s
suspicion.
the
dissenting
judge
was
of
the
view
that
garza
was
distinguishable
since
it
dealt
with
cavity--
with
a
cavity
search
which
required
a
more
stringent
standard
than
a
simple
inspection
of
clothing.
in
his
view,
the
case
was
on
“all
fours”
with
witt
v.
united
states
which
had
approved
a
personal
search.
parenthetically,
the
garza
case
was
decided
on
february
2,
1970
which
was
more
than
9
months
after
the
district
court
had
decided
the
instant
case.
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed
for
at
least
three
reasons.
first,
the
statutory
authority
for
a
customs
inspector
to
conduct
a
personal
search
on
a
basis
of
suspicion
is
clear
and
unequivocal.
second,
the
great
public
need
to
stop
the
huge
inflow
of
contraband,
particularly
narcotics,
into
this
country
demands
that
the
balancing
of
the
governmental
interest
in
inspection
against
the
traveler’s
interest
in
minimizing
inconvenience
7and
embarrassment
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
government.
and,
third,
that
the
ninth
circuit’s
objective
articulable
facts
test
is
an
impractical
and
unworkable
one.
now,
the
statute
in
question,
19
usc
482
clearly
states
that
a
customs
officer
may
search
any
person
on
whom
he
shall
suspect
there
is
contraband.
congress
used
a
simple
word,
“suspect.”
they
did
not
qualify
it.
they
did
not
use
real
suspicion,
actual
suspicion.
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
congress
meant
what
it
said.
simply,
that
a
person--
that
a
personal
search
may
be
conducted
solely
on
suspicion
and
if
they
want--
meant
otherwise,
we
think
they
would’ve
stated
because,
in
this
statute,
this
very
statute,
482,
they
set
up
two
different
standards
of
suspicion,
one,
suspicion
that
we’ve
been
talking
about
with
respect
to
the
person,
and
then
another
standard
that
relates
to
trunks
or
envelops.
in
that
statute,
it
says
that
a
customs
inspector
may
search
any
trunk
or
envelop
wherever
found
in
which
he
may
have
a
reasonable
cause
to
suspect
there
is
merchandise
which
was
imported
contrary
to
law,
which
means
that
the
congress
was
well-aware
of
the
words
that
it
was
using.
now,
this
statute
is
a
very
old
one,
over
150
years
in
age.
it
dates
back
to
1815
when
it
was
first
enacted
and,
at
that
time,
they
had
the
mere
suspicion
test
in
the
statute.
in
fact,
it
was
an
extension
of
an
even
older
statute
going
back
to
the
first
congress
of
the
united
states.
mr.
pearce
as
it
comes
over
the
border,
yes,
sir,
but
you’ll
notice
that
this
part
of
the
statute
says
“wherever
found.”
mr.
pearce
which
means
that
it
would
go
beyond
the
borders
and
they
could
trace
the
baggage
into
the
interior
and,
therefore,
i
think
they’re
one
of
the
higher
standards,
once
this
baggage
got
into
the
interior.
mr.
pearce
no.
this
is
the--
mr.
pearce
this
is
the
only
one.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
judge,
i
think
the
courts
have
said
that
not
even
suspicion
is
necessary
because
people
come
through
a
baggage
line
and
just
one
after
another
is
taken,
and
you
search
it,
and--
but,
there
is
act--
mr.
pearce
there
is
no
statute
that
says--
mr.
pearce
except
this
one,
yes,
that’s
it.
mr.
pearce
that’s
right.
that’s
what
it
says.
now,
in
the
18--
in
1815,
when
this
statute
was
first
enacted
and
it
contained
this
provision,
i
believe
that
because
of
the
kinds
of
contraband
that
existed
at
that
time
congress
must
have
thought
that
occasion
could
arise
when
a
person
would
have
to
be
stripped
in
order
to
search
that
clothing
for
contraband.
but
if
there
is
any
question
about
that,
congress
laid
it
to
rest
in
1866
because
congress
re-enacted
this
law
in
1866
and
added
a
provision,
a
provision
which
provided
that
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
could
employ
female
inspectors
for
the
purpose
of
examining
and
searching
person
of
their
own
sex,
which
means
that
they
anticipated
that
there
would
be
these
kinds
of
personal
searches.
now,
at
this
point,
i’d
like
to
draw
a
distinction
between
the
strict--
strip
search
that
i’ve
been
talking
about
and
the
cavity
search.
we
well
realize
that
people
may
argue
that
this
statute
does
not
apply
to
a
cavity
search
because
the
last
time
that
the
congress
enacted
this
law
was
in
1866
and,
at
that
time,
carrying
contraband
in
the
cavities
of
the
body
certainly
would
not
invoke
and,
furthermore,
medical
science
had
not
developed
to
the
extent
that
somebody
could
take
some
contraband,
put
it
in
the
stomach,
later
regurgitate
it
and
still
use
it.
so--
mr.
pearce
i
don’t
believe
so.
mr.
pearce
i
don’t
believe
so.
so,
we
distinguished
between
the
two,
a
strip
search
on
the
one
hand,
a
cavity
search
on
the
other.
we
certainly
believe
that
as
far
as
the
strip
search
is
concerned,
certainly,
the
law
goes
that
far
and
does
intend
to
include
the
strip
search.
mr.
pearce
i
am
putting
it
in
the
same
category
as
being
able--
as
the
statute
says
that
a
person
is
able
to
be
searched
upon
suspicion.
i’m
just--
that’s
what
the
law--
those
were
the
literal
words
of
the
statute
and
i’m
saying
that
the
statue
means
exactly
what
it
said.
mr.
pearce
well,
some
of
the
courts
seem
to
extend--
seem
to
think
there
is.
they
seem
to
point
out
that
congress
doesn’t
mean
suspicion
in
the
ordinary
sense.
they
mean
real
suspicion,
and
then
it
goes
on--
that’s
the
ninth
circuit
goes
on
to
define
what
they
think
real
suspicion
is.
i
say
that
congress,
by
its
history
of
this--
by
the
history
of
this
statute,
means
just
exactly
what
it
says.
it’s
a
simple
word,
meaning
that
if
an
officer
has
a
suspicion,
he
has
the
right
to
make
a
personal
search
and--
mr.
pearce
suspicion
means,
an
uncertainty
about
something
or
i
should
say,
exactly--
i
could
tell
you
exactly
what
it
is
because
i
happen
to
have
written
it
down,
but
i
don’t
have
it
right
handy
but,
to
me,
it
means
that
a
person
believes
that
there
is
something
wrong
on
the
basis
of
little
or
no
evidence.
mr.
pearce
it
could
be
any--
it
could
be
one
of
many
things,
anything.
shifty
eyes,
it
could
be
nervousness,
it
could
be
the
way
they
sweat,
it
could
be
almost
anything.
it
could
be
a--
suspicion,
to
me,
is
a--
simply
that
you
do
not
have
act--
you
do
not
have
proof
that
something
is
wrong,
but
you
believe
something
is
wrong.
mr.
pearce
well,
there
is--
it’s--
that’s
true.
there
is
uncertainty
in
that
because
you
are
not
sure.
you
believe
that
there
is
something
wrong,
but
you’re
not
absolutely
certain
because
you
don’t
have
absolute
proof.
you
have
little
or
no
proof.
i
believe
that’s
the
way
the
dictionary
defines
it.
mr.
pearce
well,
i
don’t
know
how
far
mental
telepathy
goes,
judge,
but
i
would
think
that--
mr.
pearce
the
suspicion
that
we’re
talking
about
with
respect
to
these
custom
agents
is
the
suspicions
that
they
get
through
their
experience,
long
experience,
of
having
looked
at
thousands
and
thousands
of
people
come
through
that
line.
mr.
pearce
well,
that
is
the
standard
that
has
been
used
and
is
exactly
what
is
meant
when
you
apply
the
term
“suspicion
to
a
customs
officer”
as
opposed
to
just
the
word
“suspicion.”
mr.
pearce
yes.
mr.
pearce
i
don’t
believe
this--
the
service
could
or
would
do
that.
mr.
pearce
but
i
do
think
that
congress--
mr.
pearce
well,
you
could
argue
that,
but
i
rather
think
that
it
would
be
better
for
the
congress
to
review
the
entire
situation
and
then
set
some
rules
that
1
out
of
every
15
people
can
be
searched.
mr.
pearce
it
would
be
a
ground--
in
fact,
it’s
the
ground
i
imagine
that
is
used
with
respect
to
baggage.
that’s
why
they
search
every
single
person’s
baggage.
they
don’t
have
any
suspicion--
mr.
pearce
but
that’s
so
much
suspicion
as
it
is
a
random
sample.
mr.
pearce
but
i
think
that
the
statute
here,
the
statute
here
relates
to
a
customs
officer.
he
must
have
the
suspicion.
in
fact,
there
had
been
cases
where
when
a
custom
officer
himself
did
not
have
a
suspicion,
the
court
ruled
that
the
search
was
not
proper.
mr.
pearce
it
could
be
argued.
mr.
pearce
i
would
think
that
if
congress
looked
into
the
matter,
held
hearings,
and
found
out
that
the
incidence
of
smuggling
was
so
great
that
they
could
pass
such
a
statute
because
they
have
the
basic
responsibility
for
controlling
foreign
commerce
and
what
is
imported
into
united
states,
i
think
if
they
could
make
a
case
for
this,
that
that
could
be
allowed
if
they
wanted
to
pass
such
legislation.
mr.
pearce
well,
i
think--
mr.
pearce
frankly,
mr.
justice,
that
the
congress
would
probably
be
in
a
better
position
by
holding
hearings
and
being
able
to
get
so
much
more
information
than
a
court
could
get
in
a
case
by
case
basis,
that
it
would
be
a
better
way
of
doing
it.
yes,
sir?
mr.
pearce
well,
i
would
think
the
fourth
amendment
has
grounded
reasonableness
and
if
it
could
be
shown
that
we
were
in
such
a
difficult
position
as--
it’s
highly
theoretical
because
i
don’t
think
it
would
ever
happen,
but
if
it
were--
if
the
congress
was
able
to
show
that
we
were--
that
almost
every
person
was
smuggling
into
this
country,
then
i
think
that
they
could
go
as
far
as
passing
a
law
to
that
effect.
mr.
pearce
that
is
true.
mr.
pearce
no.
mr.
pearce
would
the
argument
be
the
same?
mr.
pearce
no,
sir.
mr.
pearce
it
doesn’t
say
he
has
to
have
any
experience
at
all,
but
i
would
think
that
if
it
had
happened
with
somebody
with
three
days
on
duty,
first
of
all,
i
don’t
think
it
could
possibly
happen,
mr.
justice,
because,
you
see,
he
would
probably
go
to
his
superior
who
would
then
not
allow
him--
not
allow
it
to
be
done.
but,
if
he
did
do
it--
mr.
pearce
no,
the
statute
doesn’t
require
that.
no.
mr.
pearce
no.
mr.
pearce
what--
mr.
pearce
it’s
what
he--
yes,
he’s
told
that--
he
is
given
a
manual.
mr.
pearce
we
have
a
manual,
sir.
mr.
pearce
it
does
not
say
precisely
what
suspicion
is,
no.
mr.
pearce
it
says--
yes.
mr.
pearce
it
says
that
you--
that
the
agent
has
a
very
significant
power
and
that’s
the
power
to
have
some--
have
personal
searches
made
upon
suspicion
and
that
he
should
use
that
power
very
wisely,
and
they
gave
various
illustrations
that
would
show
him
how
to
use
the
power,
but
it’s
not
a--
completely
comprehensive.
it
doesn’t
cover
every
possible
circumstance.
mr.
pearce
and
he
also
goes
to
school
and
he’s
taught
further
there
and
he
also
has--
there
is
very
close
supervision
in
the
custom
service.
mr.
pearce
well,
he’s
told
in
classes
as
to
what
the
nature
of
suspicion
is,
yes.
mr.
pearce
yes,
upon
his
suspicion.
mr.
pearce
any
person
from
anywhere.
mr.
pearce
american
citizens,
yes,
sir.
mr.
pearce
well,
of
course--
mr.
pearce
well,
the
courts
have
said
that
for
a
long
time,
saying
that
the
border
search
is
other
than
other
kinds
of
search
because
a
country
has
the
right
to
set
the
terms
and
conditions
for
people
entering
the
country
and
so
it’s
not
the
same
as
a
search
in
the
interior.
mr.
pearce
no,
i
do
not
know
of
any
such--
mr.
pearce
yes,
sir.
well
to
continue,
sir,
until
recently,
the
ninth
circuit--
until
the
recent
ninth
circuit
cases,
the
courts
have
generally
agreed
that
a
personal
search
could
be
made
on
mere
suspicion
at
the
border
without
violating
the
fourth
amendment.
in
short,
they
followed
the
clear
language
of
the
statute,
and
this
was
true
even
in
the
ninth
circuit,
and
i
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
case,
particularly,
of
bible
v.
united
states
which
is
not
in
our
brief
but
which
i
came
across
during
the
time
i
was
preparing
for
argument,
314
fed.
2nd
106
decided
in
1963.
there,
a
person
appeared
to
be
nervous
has
led
to
a
strip
search
and
the
discovery
of
heroine
and
the
court
held
that
mere
suspicion
was
enough
to
justify
such
a
search.
mr.
pearce
yes,
106.
mr.
pearce
yes,
sir,
and
certiorari
was
denied
by
this
court
and,
in
that
case,
they
cited
the
witt
versus
united
states
case
which
had
reached
a
similar
conclusion.
mr.
pearce
no,
sir.
the
fourth
amendment
does
apply
to
board
of
searches.
it
definitely
does
but
congress,
as
far
back
as
1979,
made
a
distinction
between
this
search
and
other
kinds
of
search
and
they
passed
a
law
allowing
vessels
to
be
searched
solely
on
the
basis
of
suspicion
and
then
this
statute
is
really
an
extension
of
that
statute.
mr.
pearce
the
clear
indication
test
of
the
court
of
appeals?
i
would
say
that
there
should
be
something
more
for
a
cavity
search.
i
think
that
what
you’re
talking
about
is
a
balancing
of
things
and
the--
as
a
matter
of
degree,
that
there
should
be
more
for
a
cavity
search.
this
kind
of
search
just
requires
somebody
to
take
off
his
clothes
and
hand
the
clothes
to
somebody
so
the
clothes
can
be
searched
and
then
given
back.
a
cavity
search
touches
the
body,
intrudes
upon
the
body
and
i
think
a
higher
degree
of
standard,
a
higher
standard,
is
necessary.
as
i
explained
before,
i
don’t
think
the
congress
considered
this
because
the
last
time
it
enacted
that
statute
was
1866.
mr.
pearce
okay.
