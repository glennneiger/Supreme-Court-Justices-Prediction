mr.

i
think
we’ll

a

chief

and,
we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
number

united

mr.

chief

e.

mr.
reese,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready
now.
chief

warren
e.

you’re
putting
the
strip
search
in
the
same
category
then
as
the
search
of
baggage,
i
take
it.
chief

warren
e.

how
did
the
appellate
opinions
defined
it
that
way
that,
i
recall
some
language
to
the
effect,
perhaps
from
this
court
among
others,
that
it
is
not
as
may
be
seen
in
the
privacy
of
a
library
but
as
seen
through
the
off--
eyes
of
the
a
trained
officer
on
duty
in
which
he
brings
his
experience
to
bear.
is
that
not
the
standard
that’s
been
adopted
often?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
counsel,
i
wonder
if
there
isn’t
a
question
about
a
little
bit
more
than
just
the
fourth
amendment
here,
a
matter
of
the
condition.
for
example,
every
person
entering
this
building
must
open
every
piece
of
baggage
he
has
or
he
doesn’t
get
in.
now,
that’s
a
condition.
it
doesn’t
require
any
suspicion.
it
doesn’t
require
any
showing
of
reasonable
ground
or
probable
cause.
is
there
not
possibly
some
parallel
to
that
in
terms
of
putting
a
condition
on
every
person
who
wants
to
cross
our
borders?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
because
they
meet
the
standards
of
the
statute.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you’re
into
your
rebuttal
time
now,
mr.
reese,
in
the
time
you
have
there.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
beckler,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
not
about
the
requirement
before
you
leave
this
country,
before
you
can
get
a
passport,
you
get
to
submit
to
having
a
small
pox
inoculation,
among
others.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
depending
on
where
you’re
going,
a
great
many
other
things,
now
these
are
frequently,
to
some
people,
less
agreeable,
more
painful,
more
an
invasion
of
privacy
than
somebody
disrobing,
as
a
great
many
people
do
on
the
beach
and
doctor’s
offices
and
many
other
places.
now,
do
you
say
that
you’re
challenging,
too,
the
right
to
check
for
health,
communicable
disease,
matters
of
either
outgoing
or
incoming?
chief
justice
warren
e.

what’s
the
difference
on
the
constitutional
basis?
chief

e.

what
if
we

mine
built
around
the

on

chief

what’s
the

chief

chief

warren
e.

well,
i
have
seen
records
of
cases,
counsel,
where
there
was
expert
testimony,
undisputed,
that
a
single

$50,000
worth
of
raw
heroin
on
purse
without
having
it
noticeable
to
any
but
the
most
alert
and
astute
trained
observer
and
not
even

then.
