we’ll
hear
arguments
in

students
civil
rights
council
against
wadmond.
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready
mr.
dorsen.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
mr.
dorsen,
in
response
to
that
question
if
the
applicants
strongly
oppose
to
the
present
provisions
of
the
constitution
for
the
electoral
system
of
selecting
president
that
his
affirmative
answer
that
he
did
believe
them
while
entertaining
that
reservation
about
the
electoral
college
would
--
well
i’ll
ask
what
consequence
would
that
produce
in
your
view?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
then
that
the
consequence
should
be
that
the
board
can
stop
at
that
point?
if
he
takes
the
fifth
amendment
on
whether
he’s
ever
embezzled
money
from
a
principal
when
he
acted
as
agent?
suppose
the
question
were
that
specific?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
might
have
that
question
up
very
sharply
if
a
man
were
seeking
admission
having
been
admitted
in
another
state
where
he
tried
cases
and
used
disruption
as
a
tactic
of
advocacy
has
been
found
in
contempt
and
so
forth.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
consider
that
a
proper
inquiry?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
wouldn’t
you
think
it’s
alright
to
ask,
“have
you
ever
been
found
in
contempt
or
subject
to
any
disciplinary
proceeding
or
inquiry
concerning
that?”
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you’re
suggesting
really
that
we
judicially
notice
that
as
a
fact,
even
though
it
is
not
demonstrated
in
the
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
dorsen.
judge
peck,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
we
don’t
make
any
inquiry
in
this
court,
but
we
rely
on
state
admission,
do
we
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
judge
peck
it’s
true
that
anytime
a
man
has
six
witnesses
against
him,
testifying
to
a
fact
in
a
criminal
case,
he’s
got
serious
problem,
doesn’t
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
judge
peck,
i
believe
your
time
is
up.
does
mr.
dorsen
have
anymore
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.

no.

you
