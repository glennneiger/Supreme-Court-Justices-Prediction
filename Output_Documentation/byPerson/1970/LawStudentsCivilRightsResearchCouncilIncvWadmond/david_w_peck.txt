mr.
david
w.
peck
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i’m
not
sure
that
it’s
been
made
clear
what
the
requirements
of
law
and
the
questions
are
at
the
present
time.
mr.
dorsen
has
sort
of
gone
around
about
what
used
to
be
questions,
what
was
changed
at
one
time
or
another,
and
what
the
court
changed.
i
think
it
should
be
said
that
the
appellate
divisions
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
the
first
and
second
department
have
been
extremely
sensitive
and
conscientious,
indeed
on
their
own
about
these
requirements.
as
has
been
indicated
there
is
a
long
history
about
these
questions
and
requirements
and
originally
they
go
back
a
good
many
years.
and
nobody
raised
any
questions
about
them.
but
before
these
cases
were
started,
the
courts
on
their
own,
became
concerned
about
historical
record
and
whether
it
was
up-to-date
and
modern.
and
they
went
through
the
requirements
and
the
questions
and
made
substantial
changes
in
them.
then
these
proceedings
were
started
and
with
the
matters
of
complaint
here,
they
looked
at
them
again
and
made
some
other
changes,
before
the
matter
ever
got
into
court.
and
finally,
as
the
third
stage,
the
courts
have
had
the
benefit
of
the
statutory
court’s
review
of
the
procedures
and
it’s
holding
as
to
what
was
proper
and
what
was
improper.
so
that
what
you
have
now
is
what
i’m
going
to
confine
myself
to.
i
just
like
to
say,
preliminarily
to
that
that
my
friend
has
said
many
times
here,
which
there’s
no
support
whatever
in
this
record.
there
is
nothing
to
suggest
that
these
committees
roam
at
large
over
people’s
beliefs,
not
when
iota
of
a
suggestion
of
anything
of
the
kind.
they
talk
about
what
--
in
their
brief,
about
what
happened
in
rosenberg
and
kaimowitz,
there’s
nothing
in
the
record
about
it.
suffice
it
to
say,
both
rosenberg
and
kaimowitz
which
were
admitted
to
the
bar
and
mr.
cohen
from
attorney
general’s
office
tells
me
that
he
has
personally
gone
over
the
records
of
the
admissions
and
the
first
and
second
department
and
that
no
one
ever
has
been
refused
admission
to
the
bar
at
the
state
of
new
york
on
so
called
“political
grounds.”
now
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
i
can
only
tell
you
that
mr.
cohen
tells
me
that
he
is
personally
examined
the
records
and
states
that
to
be
a
fact.
i
wouldn’t
think
[voice
overlap].
mr.
david
w.
peck
well,
this
is
--
about
exclusion,
not
having
been
admitted
upon
those
grounds.
i
don’t
purport
to
say
that
he
has
gone
through
the
record
of
every
question
that
was
asked
by
a
character
committee
member,
but
he
says
that
no
one
has
been
excluded
on
political
grounds.
mr.
david
w.
peck
no,
the
denied
admission.
mr.
david
w.
peck
how
many
of
we
had
mr.
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
could
you
answer
that
mr.--
mr.
david
w.
peck
well,
that
is
a
good
question,
i
suppose,
but
i
would
say
that
the
answer
is
that
these
are
things
that
you
should
certainly
know
the
questions
as
they
exist
today,
things
that
you
should
certainly
know,
in
my
opinion,
about
an
applicant
for
member
of
the
bar.
to
my
thinking,
i
think
it
is
fundamental,
as
to
whether
a
man
believes
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
is
prepared
to
take
an
oath
to
uphold
it.
i
think
without
being
facetious
in
anyway,
your
honor,
it’s
the
same
matter
as
to
whether
it’s
the
formality
or
reality
for
the
members
of
the
class
here
this
morning,
to
take
the
oath.
we
know
that
it’s
done
everywhere
so
far
as
i
know
for
a
public
officer,
for
a
judge,
and
a
member
of
the
bar,
who
is
an
officer
of
the
court,
i
assume
starts
in
this
country,
as
distinguished
from
some
other
places
in
being
willing
to
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
i
that
it
is
fair,
basic
inquiry
at
the
outset
of
a
man
as
to
whether
he
can
conscientiously
take
that
oath
and
whether
he
does
take
it
in
good
faith.
mr.
david
w.
peck
well,
let
me
divide
this
into
two
respects,
mr.
justice.
there
are
really
two
requirements
here,
one
that
a
man
have
of
the
moral
qualifications
to
be
a
member
of
the
bar
and
the
other
is
whether
he
can
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
as
far
as
the
general
moral
character
is
concerned,
i
think
that
what
the
requirements
are
in
the
state
of
new
york
are
no
different
in
substance
and
the
more
simple
form
in
this
court,
where
you
call
upon
two
members
of
this
bar
to
state
that
they
believe
a
candidate
has
the
qualifications,
which
according
to
the
rules
of
this
court
means
that
he
appears
to
have
good
character.
mr.
david
w.
peck
that’s
right,
you
do
not
make
any
inquiry,
but
you
have
laid
down
that
as
a
requisite
when
a
member
of
this
bar
stands
before
this
court
and
makes
the
motion,
he
is
representing
that
as
far
as
he
knows
and
he
believes
that
this
a
candidate
who
has
those
character
--
has
that
that
character.
mr.
david
w.
peck
i
think
as
chief
justice
has
said
mr.
justice,
this
court
of
course,
has
to
rely
upon
the
admissions
machinery
in
the
states.
but
still,
i
think
it
is
important
that
this
court
has
laid
down
the
requisite
that
a
man
appeared
to
have
good
character,
you
are
interested
in.
you
are
concerned
about
it.
you
do
recognize
that
it
is
an
essential
to
being
a
lawyer
and
should
be
an
essential
for
admission
to
this
bar,
which
i
submit
recognizes
the
permissibility
of
that
realm
of
inquiry
at
the
state
level.
now,
what
does
that
inquiry
consist
of
as
far
as
good
moral
character
is
concerned?
it
consists
simply
of
one
thing
in
rule
8
of
the
rules
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
for
admission
of
attorneys.
it
says
proof
of
moral
character.
it
says
every
applicant
must
produce
evidence,
not
about
a
burden
of
proof,
but
be
that
as
it
may,
must
produce
evidence
that
he
possesses
the
good
moral
character
and
general
fitness,
requisite
for
an
attorney
and
counselor
at
law,
which
must
be
shown
by
the
affidavits
of
two
reputable
persons.
mr.
david
w.
peck
i’m
not
sure
your
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
it’s
under
attack
in
their
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
thank
you.
mr.
david
w.
peck
the
objective
is
made
specifically,
i
heard
from
my
friend
make
the
objection,
to
a
so-called
home
life
affidavit,
which
he
has
somewhat
overstated,
that
the
two
affiance,
are
expected
to
report
upon
the
home
life
of
the
applicant,
nothing
of
the
kind.
all
they
are
asked
is
in
what
ways
do
they
know
the
applicant,
merely
professionally
or
personally
and
the
question
is
asked,
have
they
visited
his
home?
nothing
about
what
they
found
when
ans
and
if
they
did
visit.
now
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
we’ve
changed
it.
we’ve
done
exactly
what
the
court
said.
now,
we
come
to
the
question
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
could
you
tell
me
what
page
it
is
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
that’s
of
the
old
questionnaire,
mr.
justice.
mr.
david
w.
peck
no.
mr.
david
w.
peck
no.
mr.
david
w.
peck
well,
they
put
in
their
record
here
the
whole
history
of
this
thing.
mr.
david
w.
peck
yes.
mr.
david
w.
peck
i
think
just
one
--
i’m
informed
that
pages
121
and
139.
mr.
david
w.
peck
no,
the
present
questionnaire.
mr.
david
w.
peck
125,
mr.
justice.
mr.
david
w.
peck
125.
now,
on
the
matter
of
the
so-called
political
activity,
which
is
very
narrow
indeed,
if
you
want
to
call
it,
political
activity.
there
is
the
provision
of
rule
9406,
which
if
it
were
standing
alone
and
without
any
interpretation
or
implementation
would
bother
me.
rule
9406
says
that
a
person
shall
not
be
admitted,
unless
he
shall
furnish
satisfactory
proof
that
believes
in
the
form
of
government
of
the
united
states
and
is
loyal
to
such
government.
now,
i
suppose
you
can
indulge
your
imagination
and
say
that
the
form
of
government
means
a
bicameral
legislature
and
the
electoral
college,
although
of
course,
we
all
know
that
if
any
applicant
said
that
if
he
believes
in
abolishing
the
electoral
college
and
believes
in
the
unicameral
legislature,
nobody
would
ever
ask
him
a
second
question,
let
alone
be
disturbed
in
the
slightest
by
his
answers.
mr.
david
w.
peck
that
i
think
it
well
might,
as
judge
friendly
says
you
have
to
have
some
generality
of
language.
you
can't
pick
words
always
with
an
exact
precision
that
covers
precisely
what
you
want
and
can't
conceivably
cover
something
else.
but
as
judge
friendly
pointed
out,
you
have
to
look
at
this
in
the
way
that
it
has
been
interpreted
and
applied
by
the
courts.
and,
there
is
no
question
at
all
that’s
addressed
to
an
applicant
about
his
beliefs
in
anything.
if
the
court
will
look
at
pages
5
and
6
of
our
brief,
your
honors
will
find
the
questions
which
are
asked
and
there
are
four
of
them.
the
first,
all
of
which
are
aimed
at
testing
whether
a
man
can
conscientiously
take
the
common
oath
of
supporting
the
constitution.
section
26
(a)
says,
“have
you
ever
organized
or
help
organized,
have
been
member
of
an
organization,
which
you
knew,
you
knew
was
advocating
or
teaching
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
or
by
certain
unlawful
means.”
and
that
if
your
answer
is
in
the
affirmative,
this
is
26
(b),
“did
you,
during
that
period
have
the
specific
intent
to
further
the
aims
of
such
organization
to
overthrow
or
overturn
the
government
by
unlawful
means?”
i
can't
see
any
that
any
exception
can
be
taken
to
those
questions
and
if
exception
could
be
taken,
i
submit
that
konigsberg
has
settled
it.
and
while
mr.
dorsen
says
that
he
has
not
asking
for
any
overruling
of
konigsberg,
the
brief
submitted
by
his
clients,
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
that’s
exactly
what
they’re
asking
for,
an
overruling
of
konigsberg.
mr.
david
w.
peck
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
w.
peck
well,
certainly
the
prosecution
would
have
the
burden
that
the
organization
advocated
that,
that
he
knew
it.
mr.
david
w.
peck
that
he
knew
it.
mr.
david
w.
peck
i
can
imagine
how
you
might,
it
might
be
difficult,
but
i
suppose
that
you
might
produce
members
of
the
organization,
who
testified
as
to
its
nature,
and
testified
to
conversations
that
they
had
with
this
man
when
they
asked
him
to
belong
to
the
organization
and
that
they
advised
him,
that
they
believed
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
he
said,
“that’s
right,
that’s
exactly
what
i
believe
in,”
and
that’s
why
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
could
be,
it
could
be.
mr.
david
w.
peck
most
respectfully
mr.
justice,
i
really
don’t
think
so.
mr.
david
w.
peck
i
wouldn’t
say
that.
mr.
david
w.
peck
well,
i
don’t
think
so.
mr.
david
w.
peck
i’ve
said
that
the
prosecution
would
certainly
have
to
go
on
and
show
by
evidence
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
--
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
that
he
knew
perfectly
well
when
he
joined
this
organization,
what
its
precepts
were,
that
he
subscribed
to
them
willingly
and
that
when
he
answered
the
questions
on
the
questionnaire
that
he
wasn’t
forgetful
--
[voice
overlap]
deliberately
deceitful.
mr.
david
w.
peck
well,
i
think
it
depends
upon
the
embrace
of
the
word
good
character
and
whether
or
not
it
includes
an
ability
and
a
willingness
to
take
an
oath
to
support
the
constitution,
generally
in
these
cases
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
i
think
mr.
justice,
if
you
start
with
the
premise
that
the
oath
maybe
required,
i
think
it
follows
that
a
committee
investigating
into
a
qualifications
of
a
candidate
for
admission
to
the
bar
are
entitled
to
make
an
appropriate
inquiries
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
this
man
can
conscientiously
take
that
oath
and
when
he
takes
it
will
mean
it.
mr.
david
w.
peck
he
might
say,
“i
don’t
know
about
an
organization.”
mr.
david
w.
peck
he
might
--
no,
but
the
question
is
first
that
he
was
member
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
which
you
knew,
oh,
no
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
and
he
knew
it.
mr.
david
w.
peck
and
maybe
should
be
convicted
of
perjury,
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
yes
sir,
he
has
problems.
mr.
david
w.
peck
we’re
trying
all
the
time,
mr.
justice,
cases
which
are
in
a
sensitive
area
and
where
a
defendant
sometimes
think
they
are
not
apt
to
get
a
fair
trial,
yet.
mr.
david
w.
peck
and
they
provide
for
changes
of
venue,
but
that
sometime
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
oh,
i
would
think
you
might
get
a
change
of
venue
if
you
made
a
showing
that
the
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
--
the
atmosphere,
some
other
jurisdiction,
where
they
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
i
can
only
say
very
respectfully
mr.
justice
that
i
don’t
feel
that
the
dangers
here
are
any
different
from
the
dangers
in
the
good
many
cases,
where
defendants
feel
justly
or
unjustly
that
they
have
difficulties
in
coping
with
the
nature
of
the
case
as
before
the
court,
but
we
have
to
try
them,
we
do
the
best
we
can
and
notwithstanding
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
may
i
repeat
that
there
is
no
question
here
which
asks
a
man’s
belief
about
anything.
the
questions
are,
“have
you
been
a
member
of
this
organization
knowing
and
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
--
and
that
you
have
the
specific
intent?"
mr.
david
w.
peck
and
did
you
know
it?
mr.
david
w.
peck
i
don’t
really
think
they
have
that
problem.
plus
the
specific
intent
and
then,
i’ll
just
close
by
reference
on
page
six
of
our
brief
to
questions
27
and
28,
i
mean
27
(a)
and
27
(b),
which
are
merely
inquiry,
“is
there
any
reason
why
you
cannot
take
and
subscribe
to
an
oath
or
affirmation
that
you
will
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states?
if
there
is
please
explain,
(b)
can
you
conscientiously
and
do
you
affirm
what
you
are
without
any
mental
reservation
just
as
the
oath
taken
by
a
member
of
this
court
loyal
to
and
ready
to
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states?”
it’s
my
respectful
submission
that
the
appellate
divisions
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
york
have
very
conscientiously,
with
the
aid
of
the
district
court
here
limited
these
provisions,
these
requirements,
and
these
questions
to
what
is
entirely
proper.
thank
you.
mr.
david
w.
peck
yes
sir,
mr.
justice.
mr.
david
w.
peck
no,
i
don’t
think
that’s
the
issue
and
i
would
answer
that
question
mr.
justice
by
saying
that
i
don’t
think
that
a
man
should
be
denied
admission
merely
because
he
is
at
one
time
or
another,
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
no,
i
wouldn't
think
that
alone
properly
would
be
sufficient.
i
think
it
is
perfectly
clearly
indicated
here
mr.
justice
what
the
line
is
and
that
is
belonging
to
the
organization,
knowing
that
it
believes
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
violence
and
that
the
applicant
has
the
specific
intent.
mr.
david
w.
peck
yes
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
the
applicant
for
admission
to
the
bar
has
this
specific
intent
to
have
the
government
overthrown
by
force.
mr.
david
w.
peck
well,
that’s
how
i
understood
the
question
mr.
justice.
mr.
david
w.
peck
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i’m
not
sure
that
it’s
been
made
clear
what
the
requirements
of
law
and
the
questions
are
at
the
present
time.
mr.
dorsen
has
sort
of
gone
around
about
what
used
to
be
questions,
what
was
changed
at
one
time
or
another,
and
what
the
court
changed.
i
think
it
should
be
said
that
the
appellate
divisions
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
the
first
and
second
department
have
been
extremely
sensitive
and
conscientious,
indeed
on
their
own
about
these
requirements.
as
has
been
indicated
there
is
a
long
history
about
these
questions
and
requirements
and
originally
they
go
back
a
good
many
years.
and
nobody
raised
any
questions
about
them.
but
before
these
cases
were
started,
the
courts
on
their
own,
became
concerned
about
historical
record
and
whether
it
was
up-to-date
and
modern.
and
they
went
through
the
requirements
and
the
questions
and
made
substantial
changes
in
them.
then
these
proceedings
were
started
and
with
the
matters
of
complaint
here,
they
looked
at
them
again
and
made
some
other
changes,
before
the
matter
ever
got
into
court.
and
finally,
as
the
third
stage,
the
courts
have
had
the
benefit
of
the
statutory
court’s
review
of
the
procedures
and
it’s
holding
as
to
what
was
proper
and
what
was
improper.
so
that
what
you
have
now
is
what
i’m
going
to
confine
myself
to.
i
just
like
to
say,
preliminarily
to
that
that
my
friend
has
said
many
times
here,
which
there’s
no
support
whatever
in
this
record.
there
is
nothing
to
suggest
that
these
committees
roam
at
large
over
people’s
beliefs,
not
when
iota
of
a
suggestion
of
anything
of
the
kind.
they
talk
about
what
--
in
their
brief,
about
what
happened
in
rosenberg
and
kaimowitz,
there’s
nothing
in
the
record
about
it.
suffice
it
to
say,
both
rosenberg
and
kaimowitz
which
were
admitted
to
the
bar
and
mr.
cohen
from
attorney
general’s
office
tells
me
that
he
has
personally
gone
over
the
records
of
the
admissions
and
the
first
and
second
department
and
that
no
one
ever
has
been
refused
admission
to
the
bar
at
the
state
of
new
york
on
so
called
“political
grounds.”
now
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
i
can
only
tell
you
that
mr.
cohen
tells
me
that
he
is
personally
examined
the
records
and
states
that
to
be
a
fact.
i
wouldn’t
think
[voice
overlap].
mr.
david
w.
peck
well,
this
is
--
about
exclusion,
not
having
been
admitted
upon
those
grounds.
i
don’t
purport
to
say
that
he
has
gone
through
the
record
of
every
question
that
was
asked
by
a
character
committee
member,
but
he
says
that
no
one
has
been
excluded
on
political
grounds.
mr.
david
w.
peck
no,
the
denied
admission.
mr.
david
w.
peck
how
many
of
we
had
mr.
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
could
you
answer
that
mr.--
mr.
david
w.
peck
well,
that
is
a
good
question,
i
suppose,
but
i
would
say
that
the
answer
is
that
these
are
things
that
you
should
certainly
know
the
questions
as
they
exist
today,
things
that
you
should
certainly
know,
in
my
opinion,
about
an
applicant
for
member
of
the
bar.
to
my
thinking,
i
think
it
is
fundamental,
as
to
whether
a
man
believes
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
is
prepared
to
take
an
oath
to
uphold
it.
i
think
without
being
facetious
in
anyway,
your
honor,
it’s
the
same
matter
as
to
whether
it’s
the
formality
or
reality
for
the
members
of
the
class
here
this
morning,
to
take
the
oath.
we
know
that
it’s
done
everywhere
so
far
as
i
know
for
a
public
officer,
for
a
judge,
and
a
member
of
the
bar,
who
is
an
officer
of
the
court,
i
assume
starts
in
this
country,
as
distinguished
from
some
other
places
in
being
willing
to
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
i
that
it
is
fair,
basic
inquiry
at
the
outset
of
a
man
as
to
whether
he
can
conscientiously
take
that
oath
and
whether
he
does
take
it
in
good
faith.
mr.
david
w.
peck
well,
let
me
divide
this
into
two
respects,
mr.
justice.
there
are
really
two
requirements
here,
one
that
a
man
have
of
the
moral
qualifications
to
be
a
member
of
the
bar
and
the
other
is
whether
he
can
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
as
far
as
the
general
moral
character
is
concerned,
i
think
that
what
the
requirements
are
in
the
state
of
new
york
are
no
different
in
substance
and
the
more
simple
form
in
this
court,
where
you
call
upon
two
members
of
this
bar
to
state
that
they
believe
a
candidate
has
the
qualifications,
which
according
to
the
rules
of
this
court
means
that
he
appears
to
have
good
character.
mr.
david
w.
peck
that’s
right,
you
do
not
make
any
inquiry,
but
you
have
laid
down
that
as
a
requisite
when
a
member
of
this
bar
stands
before
this
court
and
makes
the
motion,
he
is
representing
that
as
far
as
he
knows
and
he
believes
that
this
a
candidate
who
has
those
character
--
has
that
that
character.
mr.
david
w.
peck
i
think
as
chief
justice
has
said
mr.
justice,
this
court
of
course,
has
to
rely
upon
the
admissions
machinery
in
the
states.
but
still,
i
think
it
is
important
that
this
court
has
laid
down
the
requisite
that
a
man
appeared
to
have
good
character,
you
are
interested
in.
you
are
concerned
about
it.
you
do
recognize
that
it
is
an
essential
to
being
a
lawyer
and
should
be
an
essential
for
admission
to
this
bar,
which
i
submit
recognizes
the
permissibility
of
that
realm
of
inquiry
at
the
state
level.
now,
what
does
that
inquiry
consist
of
as
far
as
good
moral
character
is
concerned?
it
consists
simply
of
one
thing
in
rule
8
of
the
rules
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
for
admission
of
attorneys.
it
says
proof
of
moral
character.
it
says
every
applicant
must
produce
evidence,
not
about
a
burden
of
proof,
but
be
that
as
it
may,
must
produce
evidence
that
he
possesses
the
good
moral
character
and
general
fitness,
requisite
for
an
attorney
and
counselor
at
law,
which
must
be
shown
by
the
affidavits
of
two
reputable
persons.
mr.
david
w.
peck
i’m
not
sure
your
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
it’s
under
attack
in
their
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
thank
you.
mr.
david
w.
peck
the
objective
is
made
specifically,
i
heard
from
my
friend
make
the
objection,
to
a
so-called
home
life
affidavit,
which
he
has
somewhat
overstated,
that
the
two
affiance,
are
expected
to
report
upon
the
home
life
of
the
applicant,
nothing
of
the
kind.
all
they
are
asked
is
in
what
ways
do
they
know
the
applicant,
merely
professionally
or
personally
and
the
question
is
asked,
have
they
visited
his
home?
nothing
about
what
they
found
when
ans
and
if
they
did
visit.
now
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
we’ve
changed
it.
we’ve
done
exactly
what
the
court
said.
now,
we
come
to
the
question
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
could
you
tell
me
what
page
it
is
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
that’s
of
the
old
questionnaire,
mr.
justice.
mr.
david
w.
peck
no.
mr.
david
w.
peck
no.
mr.
david
w.
peck
well,
they
put
in
their
record
here
the
whole
history
of
this
thing.
mr.
david
w.
peck
yes.
mr.
david
w.
peck
i
think
just
one
--
i’m
informed
that
pages
121
and
139.
mr.
david
w.
peck
no,
the
present
questionnaire.
mr.
david
w.
peck
125,
mr.
justice.
mr.
david
w.
peck
125.
now,
on
the
matter
of
the
so-called
political
activity,
which
is
very
narrow
indeed,
if
you
want
to
call
it,
political
activity.
there
is
the
provision
of
rule
9406,
which
if
it
were
standing
alone
and
without
any
interpretation
or
implementation
would
bother
me.
rule
9406
says
that
a
person
shall
not
be
admitted,
unless
he
shall
furnish
satisfactory
proof
that
believes
in
the
form
of
government
of
the
united
states
and
is
loyal
to
such
government.
now,
i
suppose
you
can
indulge
your
imagination
and
say
that
the
form
of
government
means
a
bicameral
legislature
and
the
electoral
college,
although
of
course,
we
all
know
that
if
any
applicant
said
that
if
he
believes
in
abolishing
the
electoral
college
and
believes
in
the
unicameral
legislature,
nobody
would
ever
ask
him
a
second
question,
let
alone
be
disturbed
in
the
slightest
by
his
answers.
mr.
david
w.
peck
that
i
think
it
well
might,
as
judge
friendly
says
you
have
to
have
some
generality
of
language.
you
can't
pick
words
always
with
an
exact
precision
that
covers
precisely
what
you
want
and
can't
conceivably
cover
something
else.
but
as
judge
friendly
pointed
out,
you
have
to
look
at
this
in
the
way
that
it
has
been
interpreted
and
applied
by
the
courts.
and,
there
is
no
question
at
all
that’s
addressed
to
an
applicant
about
his
beliefs
in
anything.
if
the
court
will
look
at
pages
5
and
6
of
our
brief,
your
honors
will
find
the
questions
which
are
asked
and
there
are
four
of
them.
the
first,
all
of
which
are
aimed
at
testing
whether
a
man
can
conscientiously
take
the
common
oath
of
supporting
the
constitution.
section
26
(a)
says,
“have
you
ever
organized
or
help
organized,
have
been
member
of
an
organization,
which
you
knew,
you
knew
was
advocating
or
teaching
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
or
by
certain
unlawful
means.”
and
that
if
your
answer
is
in
the
affirmative,
this
is
26
(b),
“did
you,
during
that
period
have
the
specific
intent
to
further
the
aims
of
such
organization
to
overthrow
or
overturn
the
government
by
unlawful
means?”
i
can't
see
any
that
any
exception
can
be
taken
to
those
questions
and
if
exception
could
be
taken,
i
submit
that
konigsberg
has
settled
it.
and
while
mr.
dorsen
says
that
he
has
not
asking
for
any
overruling
of
konigsberg,
the
brief
submitted
by
his
clients,
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
that’s
exactly
what
they’re
asking
for,
an
overruling
of
konigsberg.
mr.
david
w.
peck
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
w.
peck
well,
certainly
the
prosecution
would
have
the
burden
that
the
organization
advocated
that,
that
he
knew
it.
mr.
david
w.
peck
that
he
knew
it.
mr.
david
w.
peck
i
can
imagine
how
you
might,
it
might
be
difficult,
but
i
suppose
that
you
might
produce
members
of
the
organization,
who
testified
as
to
its
nature,
and
testified
to
conversations
that
they
had
with
this
man
when
they
asked
him
to
belong
to
the
organization
and
that
they
advised
him,
that
they
believed
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
he
said,
“that’s
right,
that’s
exactly
what
i
believe
in,”
and
that’s
why
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
could
be,
it
could
be.
mr.
david
w.
peck
most
respectfully
mr.
justice,
i
really
don’t
think
so.
mr.
david
w.
peck
i
wouldn’t
say
that.
mr.
david
w.
peck
well,
i
don’t
think
so.
mr.
david
w.
peck
i’ve
said
that
the
prosecution
would
certainly
have
to
go
on
and
show
by
evidence
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
--
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
that
he
knew
perfectly
well
when
he
joined
this
organization,
what
its
precepts
were,
that
he
subscribed
to
them
willingly
and
that
when
he
answered
the
questions
on
the
questionnaire
that
he
wasn’t
forgetful
--
[voice
overlap]
deliberately
deceitful.
mr.
david
w.
peck
well,
i
think
it
depends
upon
the
embrace
of
the
word
good
character
and
whether
or
not
it
includes
an
ability
and
a
willingness
to
take
an
oath
to
support
the
constitution,
generally
in
these
cases
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
i
think
mr.
justice,
if
you
start
with
the
premise
that
the
oath
maybe
required,
i
think
it
follows
that
a
committee
investigating
into
a
qualifications
of
a
candidate
for
admission
to
the
bar
are
entitled
to
make
an
appropriate
inquiries
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
this
man
can
conscientiously
take
that
oath
and
when
he
takes
it
will
mean
it.
mr.
david
w.
peck
he
might
say,
“i
don’t
know
about
an
organization.”
mr.
david
w.
peck
he
might
--
no,
but
the
question
is
first
that
he
was
member
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
which
you
knew,
oh,
no
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
and
he
knew
it.
mr.
david
w.
peck
and
maybe
should
be
convicted
of
perjury,
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
yes
sir,
he
has
problems.
mr.
david
w.
peck
we’re
trying
all
the
time,
mr.
justice,
cases
which
are
in
a
sensitive
area
and
where
a
defendant
sometimes
think
they
are
not
apt
to
get
a
fair
trial,
yet.
mr.
david
w.
peck
and
they
provide
for
changes
of
venue,
but
that
sometime
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
oh,
i
would
think
you
might
get
a
change
of
venue
if
you
made
a
showing
that
the
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
--
the
atmosphere,
some
other
jurisdiction,
where
they
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
i
can
only
say
very
respectfully
mr.
justice
that
i
don’t
feel
that
the
dangers
here
are
any
different
from
the
dangers
in
the
good
many
cases,
where
defendants
feel
justly
or
unjustly
that
they
have
difficulties
in
coping
with
the
nature
of
the
case
as
before
the
court,
but
we
have
to
try
them,
we
do
the
best
we
can
and
notwithstanding
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
may
i
repeat
that
there
is
no
question
here
which
asks
a
man’s
belief
about
anything.
the
questions
are,
“have
you
been
a
member
of
this
organization
knowing
and
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
--
and
that
you
have
the
specific
intent?"
mr.
david
w.
peck
and
did
you
know
it?
mr.
david
w.
peck
i
don’t
really
think
they
have
that
problem.
plus
the
specific
intent
and
then,
i’ll
just
close
by
reference
on
page
six
of
our
brief
to
questions
27
and
28,
i
mean
27
(a)
and
27
(b),
which
are
merely
inquiry,
“is
there
any
reason
why
you
cannot
take
and
subscribe
to
an
oath
or
affirmation
that
you
will
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states?
if
there
is
please
explain,
(b)
can
you
conscientiously
and
do
you
affirm
what
you
are
without
any
mental
reservation
just
as
the
oath
taken
by
a
member
of
this
court
loyal
to
and
ready
to
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states?”
it’s
my
respectful
submission
that
the
appellate
divisions
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
york
have
very
conscientiously,
with
the
aid
of
the
district
court
here
limited
these
provisions,
these
requirements,
and
these
questions
to
what
is
entirely
proper.
thank
you.
mr.

yes
sir,
mr.
justice.
mr.
david
w.
peck
no,
i
don’t
think
that’s
the
issue
and
i
would
answer
that
question
mr.
justice
by
saying
that
i
don’t
think
that
a
man
should
be
denied
admission
merely
because
he
is
at
one
time
or
another,
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
no,
i
wouldn't
think
that
alone
properly
would
be
sufficient.
i
think
it
is
perfectly
clearly
indicated
here
mr.
justice
what
the
line
is
and
that
is
belonging
to
the
organization,
knowing
that
it
believes
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
violence
and
that
the
applicant
has
the
specific
intent.
mr.
david
w.
peck
yes
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
the
applicant
for
admission
to
the
bar
has
this
specific
intent
to
have
the
government
overthrown
by
force.
mr.
david
w.
peck
well,
that’s
how
i
understood
the
question
mr.
justice.
