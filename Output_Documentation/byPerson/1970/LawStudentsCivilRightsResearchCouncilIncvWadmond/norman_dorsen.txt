mr.
norman
dorsen
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
this
is
a
third
in
the
succession
of
bar
admission
cases
that
the
court
has
been
hearing.
it’s
an
appeal
from
a
decision
of
a
three-judge
court
to
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
the
suit
in
this
case
was
an
affirmative
suit
brought
by
three
law
students,
three
applicants
to
the
bar
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
three
organizations,
including
a
law
students
civil
rights
research
council,
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
certain
statutes
and
statewide
judicial
rules
governing
the
admission
to
the
new
york
bar.
in
addition,
the
complaint
made
similar
allegations
concerning
the
implementation
of
the
statutes
and
rules
through
questionnaires,
affidavits,
interviews
and
other
practices
i
shall
describe
shortly.
a
majority
of
the
three-judge
court
below,
judges
friendly
and
bonsal
granted
the
appellants
partial
relief,
but
upheld
its
challenge
statutes
and
statewide
judicial
rules.
judge
constance
motley,
in
an
extensive
dissenting
opinion,
took
the
view
that
the
principle
portions
of
the
majority
opinion
were
erroneous
and
she
would
have
broadly
declare
unconstitutional
one
new
york
statute
on
its
face,
and
the
other
as
applied.
it’s
important
for
an
understanding
of
this
case
to
perceive
the
type
of
personal
and
political
screening
program
that
takes
place
in
the
state
of
new
york.
the
statutes
and
judicial
rules
that
are
relevant
are
set
out
in
the
appendix
to
the
brief
for
appellants,
starting
on
page
1a.
section
90
of
the
new
york
judiciary
law
provides,
“the
admission
to
and
removal
from
the
practice
by
the
appellate
division
takes
place
when
the
appellate
division
and
the
state
board
of
law
examiners
are
satisfied
that
each
person
who
passes
the
bar
exam,
possess
the
character
and
general
fitness
requisite
for
an
attorney
and
counselor
at
law.”
rule
81,
immediately
underneath
section
90
on
page
3a
of
the
appendix
provides,
this
is
an
implementing
rule
that
has
the
effect
of
a
statute,
“that
each
applicant
to
the
bar
must
produce
before
a
committee
a
character
and
fitness
evidence
that
he
possess
the
good
moral
character
and
general
fitness
requisite
for
an
attorney.”
on
the
facing
page,
page
2a,
is
rule
9406
which
provides
“that
no
person
shall
receive
a
certificate
from
any
committee,
any
bar
committee
and
no
person
shall
be
admitted
to
practice
as
an
attorney
unless
he
shall
furnish
satisfactory
proof
to
the
effect
among
other
things
that
he
believes
in
the
form
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
and
is
loyal
to
such
government”
and
there
are
three
other
requirements
including
citizenship
and
residence.
now,
these
standards
for
admissions
in
the
state
of
new
york
are
implemented
by
a
complex
procedural
mechanisms
that
delves
deeply
into
the
political
and
personal
lives
of
each
applicant.
i
shall
be
more
specific
about
this
later.
it
will
suffice
to
say
now
that
each
applicant
must
answer
extended
questionnaires
that
raise
questions
regarding
every
aspect
of
his
life.
secondly,
there
are
so-called
home
life
affidavits
which
must
be
submitted
to
the
bar
committee
by
persons
who
know
the
applicant
personally
and
have
visited
in
his
home.
third,
there
are
independent
investigations
that
take
place,
including
inquiries
of
the
applicant’s
school
and
draft
board,
his
former
employers
and
to
police
and
other
agencies,
as
well
as
the
general
public
through
publication
in
the
new
york
law
journal.
finally,
after
all
the
information
is
reviewed
by
a
committee
member,
a
personal
interview
takes
place.
if
there
is
nothing
unorthodox
about
an
applicant,
the
interview
will
be
perfunctory
and
admission
will
follow
almost
automatically.
but
if
there
some
unorthodox
political
activity
or
associations,
there
is
an
intensified
investigation,
new
interviews,
new
questions
and
sometimes
a
delay
in
admission
at
personal
and
professional
cost
to
the
applicant.
all
these
takes
place
at
a
low
level
of
visibility,
but
the
effect
on
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
applicant
is
destructive.
first,
it
involves
an
unwarranted
intrusion
broadly
into
their
political
and
personal
privacy
and
secondly,
it
inhibits
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights
by
law
students
and
applicants
because
of
a
fear
of
delay
in
admission.
all
this
is
destructive
to
them,
it’s
also
destructive
to
the
national
interest
as
i
shall
try
to
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
there
are
--
this
case
involves
the
second
department
and
the
first
department,
but
there
are
questionnaires
in
all
four
departments.
mr.
norman
dorsen
very
similar.
the
three-judge
court
below
unanimously
agreed
in
an
opinion
by
judge
friendly
that
certain
practices
of
the
bar
committees
were
invalid.
they
held
question
27(a),
which
ask
applicants,
“do
you
believe
in
the
principles
of
the
form
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
to
be
impermissibly
vague
and
overbroad?”
it
held
question
26
also
invalid.
that
question
dealt
and
currently
deals
with
membership
in
organizations
advocating
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
judge
friendly
held
that
the
question
is
at
formally
provided
was
invalid
because
it
did
not
require
knowledge
by
the
applicant
of
the
illegal
purposes
of
the
organization
and
there
was
no
requirement
that
the
illegal
activity
of
the
organization
be
coincident
with
the
membership
of
the
individual.
finally,
judge
friendly
held
invalid
question
31,
which
formally
inquired
whether
there
was
any
incident
in
your
life,
the
life
of
the
applicant,
that
was
called
for
by
the
forgoing
questions
on
the
questionnaire,
which
has
any
favorable
or
detrimental
bearing
on
your
character
or
fitness
and
judge
friendly
held
that
this
kind
of
soul-searching
question
was
too
broad
and
he
struck
it
down.
at
the
same
time,
the
defendants
themselves
deleted
certain
questions
from
their
questionnaire
and
what
judge
motley
termed
the
tacit
confession
of
error.
these
extremely
broad
questions,
which
are
found
on
page
183
of
the
record,
dealt
broadly
with
membership
in
organizations
and
societies
that
the
applicant
may
have
joined
before
and
during
law
school
and
extra
curricular
activities
that
he
engaged
in
or
may
have
engaged
in
while
a
student,
but
the
majority
below
upheld
the
two
relevant
new
york
statutes
and
the
implementing
questions.
we
have
many
objections,
both
to
the
statutes
and
the
questions
and
the
implementing
procedures,
but
they
boil
down
to
two
principle
points.
the
first
point
is
that
section
9
--
rule
9406,
which
is
on
2a
of
the
appendix,
and
the
implementing
question,
question
27,
are
invalid
because
they
compel
a
declaration
of
belief
and
are
impermissibly
vague.
second,
that
section
90
of
the
judiciary
law,
the
good
moral
character
standard,
which
incidentally
we
do
not
dispute
on
its
face
because
we
accept
judge,
justice
frankfurter’s
for
this
formulation
of
the
good
moral
character
standard
as
mr.
boudin
stated
yesterday
from
the
schware
case.
but
we
do
maintain
that
section
90
has
been
invalidly
applied
because
it’s
been
used
to
test
the
political
ideas
of
the
applicants
that
are
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
both
because
of
the
invalidity
of
the
revised
question
26,
which
is
found
in
page
6a
of
the
appendix
and
because
of
the
impermissibly
broad
pattern
of
investigation
into
protected
activity
that
the
bar
committees
undertake.
now,
before
turning
to
my
first
point,
i
would
like
very
briefly
to
make
four
preliminary
comments
that
are
central
to
an
understanding
of
our
position.
the
first
concerns
the
deterrent
effect
on
a
political
activity
of
students.
i
have
seen
this
for
10
years
at
new
york
university
law
school.
this
is
not
an
imagination,
this
is
not
a
product
of
anyone’s
imagination,
it
is
not
a
chimerical
allegation.
there
are
students
who
are
deterred
from
political
activity.
there
are
professors
who
tell
students
not
to
engage
in
political
activity
until
they’re
members
of
the
bar.
some
of
the
most
responsible
students,
some
of
the
best
students
are
deterred
from
lawful
political
activity.
many
of
these
students
and
the
families
of
these
students
have
gone
to
great
extent
to
put
them
through
law
school,
even
a
delay
of
a
few
months
in
earning
a
living
is
relevant
to
the
prospects
of
their
families
and
their
own
prospects.
the
two
cases
that
are
cited
in
the
brief,
the
cases
of
messrs
rosenberg
and
kaimowitz
are
examples
of
people
who
have
been
delayed
by
the
character
committee
for
engaging
an
undoubted
political
activity.
secondly,
nothing
that
is
being
urged
here
in
any
sense
is
inconsistent
with
the
ability
of
the
bar
and
the
courts
to
discipline
improper
conduct
of
applicants
or
members
of
the
bar.
mr.
boudin
has
reviewed
four
different
types
of
sanctions
that
are
available
and
i
shall
not
repeat
them,
but
i
will
deal
with
one
other
aspect.
every
one
of
us
is
concern
by
violence,
everyone
of
us
is
concern
by
disruption
in
courtrooms.
in
my
experience,
the
bar
associations
of
this
country
are
able
to
respond
to
this
problem
in
a
constitutional
manner.
the
aba
has
setup
a
special
committee
under
judge
murray
and
who’s
a
member
of
the
district
court
in
the
first
circuit,
to
set
standards
for
behavior
by
judges,
by
lawyers,
by
spectators
and
by
defendants.
that
committee
has
already
issued
a
preliminary
report.
the
bar
association
of
the
city
of
new
york
has
setup
a
special
committee
with
men
like
bruce
bromley,
best
webster,
george
lindsey
and
burk
marshall
on
the
committee
to
look
into
the
same
matter.
i
have
the
privilege
of
being
the
executive
director
of
that
study.
the
bar
association
has
not
been
delinquent.
the
bar
associations
of
this
country
are
able
to
deal
with
conduct
that
is
impermissible,
conduct
that
deserves
the
sanction
of
either
the
bar
or
the
court.
but
this
is
not
conduct
we’re
dealing
with
here,
it’s
the
delving
into
protected
political
activity.
third,
none
of
the
criticisms
of
the
statute,
none
of
the
criticisms
of
the
questions,
none
of
the
criticisms
of
the
practices
that
we’re
making
here
are
meant
in
a
slightest
to
impute
a
good
faith,
the
integrity
of
the
members
of
the
bar
committees,
the
members
of
the
courts
of
new
york
or
any
other
state.
these
men
are
operating
under
a
system
that
was
handed
to
them.
they
are
doing
their
very
best
to
implement
that
system,
but
it’s
a
system
that
was
setup
without
full
consciousness
of
the
first
amendment
problems
that
are
raised.
i
want
to
repeat,
we’re
not
criticizing
individuals,
we’re
not
suggesting
that
there’s
a
certain
venality
or
arbitrariness
on
the
part
of
particular
people
or
committees.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
a
structure
has
been
setup
that’s
improper
and
it
should
be
dealt
with.
mr.
norman
dorsen
the
record
shows
the
history
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
the
history
shows
--
the
record
shows
the
previous
questions
that
were
asked
and
the
present
questions.
the
new
york’s
system
was
setup
in
1921.
it
traces
back
to
1921
--
questions
of
this
time
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
but
this
kind
of
investigation.
mr.
norman
dorsen
it
does
not.
it
does
not
mr.
justice.
the
final
preliminary
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
there’s
no
need
for
this
court
to
overrule
the
konigsberg
and
estoppel
cases
to
deal
with
the
invalid
statutes
and
practices
here.
the
question
in
the
konigsberg
was
a
different
kind
of
question
from
the
question
that
is
being
asked
of
the
applicants
in
new
york.
the
foundation
for
the
question
as
mr.
justice
harlan
pointed
out
in
both
opinions
in
those
cases
had
been
laid
and
the
committee
was
trying
to
fill
in
gaps.
there
are
no
gaps
here,
there
is
no
foundation
here.
we’re
dealing
here
with
questions
that
are
being
asked
of
every
single
applicant
to
the
new
york
bar.
the
entire
generation
of
lawyers,
they
are
going
to
have
deal
with
the
problems
that
all
of
us
are
dealing
with
at
the
present
time.
and
finally,
konigsberg
and
estoppel
are
distinguishable
of
course,
because
the
governing
constitutional
principles
that
have
evolve
--
have
been
evolved
by
this
court
have
changed
in
last
decade.
it’s
exactly
decades
as
the
konigsberg
case
was
argued
in
this
court.
now,
what
i
would
like
to
do
is
deal
with
the
first
principle
point
that
i
alluded
to
earlier,
namely
rule
9406,
which
is
found
at
page
2a
of
the
appendix.
and
here
we
have
a
rule
which
is
of
statewide
applicability
and
has
the
force
of
the
statute
that
whatever
the
doubts
may
have
been
in
the
arizona
case
that
mr.
justice
white
raised,
this
is
a
belief
question.
it
is
clear
that
each
person
who
wants
to
be
a
member
of
the
bar
must
furnish
satisfactory
proof
to
the
effect
that
he
believes
in
the
form
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
and
is
loyal
to
that
government.
and
there
are
many
expressions
by
members
of
this
court.
mr.
justice
robert’s
memorable
quote
was
referred
to
yesterday
by
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
justice
jackson
on
another
occasion
expressed
what
seems
to
me
the
most
cogent
terms,
the
reasons
why
belief
is
absolutely
inviolable.
mr.
norman
dorsen
no
i
did
not.
the
constitutional
oath
that
was
raised
in
the
knight
case,
it
was
affirmed
pre
curiam
by
this
court,
we
have
to
objection
to
at
all,
but
this
is
not
that
case.
this
deals
with
belief
and
as
mr.
justice
jackson
said,
“i
know
of
no
situation
in
which
a
citizen
may
incur
a
civil
or
criminal
liability
or
disability
because
a
court
infers
an
evil
mental
state
where
no
act
at
all
has
occurred.
attempts
of
the
court
to
fathom
modern
political
meditations
would
be
as
futile
and
mischievous
as
the
efforts
of
the
infamous
heresy
trials
of
old
that
fathomed
religious
beliefs.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that
--
i
think
that’s
a
very,
very
basic
question
and
our
second
objection
to
this
standard
is
that’s
impermissibly
vague.
it
talks
about
the
form
of
the
government,
a
form
of
the
government
of
the
united
states.
does
this
mean
the
electoral
system?
does
this
mean
the
capitalist
system?
does
this
mean
the
federal
system?
the
center
for
democratic
studies
under
mr.
hudson
(ph)
has
recently
proposed
a
new
constitution,
which
would
divide
the
country
into
regions,
which
would
give
different
powers
to
the
supreme
court.
that
would
certainly
change
our
form
of
government.
does
an
applicant
to
be
in
a
position
where
he
has
to
guess
if
he
has
unorthodox
political
views
as
to
what
the
form
of
government
of
united
states
really
is
or
what
a
judge
or
jury
might
consider
it
to
be
and
judge
friendly
dealt
with
this
point.
he
said
that
it
was
wrong
and
improper
to
inquire
of
an
applicant
as
to
whether
he
was
loyal
to
the
principles
underlying
the
form
of
government.
he
did
not
explain
why
the
same
objections
did
not
apply
to
the
slightly
shorter
formulation,
but
it
seems
to
me
indistinguishable
formulation,
a
form
of
government
of
the
united
states.
and
judge
motley
in
her
dissent
raised
this
very
question,
and
as
far
as
i
know
there’s
nothing
in
judge
friendly’s
opinion
which
satisfactory
deals
with
this
issue
for
the
very
reason
suggested
by
the
chief
justice.
now,
the
state
says
that
section
9406
is
really
like
the
constitutional
oath
that
mr.
justice
harlan
raised
in
connection
with
the
members
of
the
bar
who
just
admitted
that
one
will
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
but
that’s
not
what
this
says.
that’s
just
not
what
it
says.
there’s
no
warrant
to
revise
this
formulation
in
light
of
what
would
be
a
constitutional
formulation
especially
is
this
true
in
light
of
question
27,
which
implements
this
section
and
says
among
other
things,
“can
you
conscientiously
and
do
you
affirm
that
you
are,
without
any
mental
reservation
loyal
to
and
ready
to
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states?”
now,
the
“without
any
mental
reservation”
clause
is
certainly
a
belief
clause.
mental
reservation
--
a
man
may
have
a
question
about
the
bicameral
system,
about
one
man
one
vote,
about
whether
or
not
in
this
modern
age
we
need
regional
government
rather
than
state
government.
now,
this
section
or
this
rule
9406,
the
implementing
question
are
invalid
for
a
wholly
distinct
reason
and
that
is
under
speiser
and
randall,
it
impermissibly
places
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
applicant.
judge
motley
said
on
her
opinion
that
this
was
the
very
heart
of
the
case
and
the
reason
judge
motley
thought
this
was
the
very
heart
of
the
case
is
spelled
out
fully
in
justice
brennan’s
opinion
in
the
speiser
case.
and
that
is
that
the
hazard
of
mistaken
fact
finding
is
so
great
and
a
potential
loss
to
the
applicant
and
the
law
student
is
so
great
that
he
will
steer
far
wider
of
the
unlawful
zone
if
he
has
the
burden
of
proof.
now
in
its
brief,
the
state
attempts
to
avoid
the
thrust
of
speiser
without
even
mentioning
the
case
by
saying
that
there’s
a
distinction
between
coming
forward
with
evidence,
the
burden
of
initial
coming
forward
on
the
one
hand
and
the
burden
of
ultimate
proof
on
the
other.
it
seems
to
us
that
this
is
an
inadequate
answer.
in
the
first
place
the
language
of
rule
9406
says
explicitly
that
the
applicant
must
furnish
satisfactory
proof.
the
burden
of
proof
is
built
in
to
the
section.
secondly,
the
practical
implementation
of
this
section
in
new
york
as
both
the
kaimowitz
and
the
rosenberg
cases
which
are
cited
incidentally
on
page
10
of
the
brief
in
opposition
to
the
motion
to
affirm
show
that
the
way
the
mechanism
works
and
very
naturally
works
is
that
when
there’s
a
question
about
an
applicant,
as
the
gentleman
from
ohio
said
a
moment
ago,
more
questions
are
asked
until
the
bar
committee
is
satisfied.
and
of
course,
under
section
90,
at
the
top
of
page
3a
of
the
appendix,
it
says
that
the
state
board
of
law
examiners
must
be
satisfied.
now,
that’s
burden
of
proof
language
and
i
might
add
that
despite
what
new
york
says
here,
in
the
konigsberg
opinion
itself
at
366
us,
page
41
in
the
footnote,
mr.
justice
harlan
lists
new
york
state
as
among
the
states
where
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
applicant.
so,
it
seems
to
us
that
apart
from
the
defects
that
are
inherent
in
the
rule
and
the
implementing
question,
the
burden
of
proof
problems
that
are
raised
by
speiser
and
randall
are
all
together
supportive
of
our
concern.
mr.
norman
dorsen
the
one
case
which
deals
with
this
is
the
cassidy
case
which
is
cited
in
the
brief
and
is
unclear
whether
that
person
was
denied
admission
because
of
a
political
matter
or
because
of
a
deception
that
he
played
upon
the
committee.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
there
were
very
few
people
who
were
denied
admission
to
the
bar
on
political
grounds,
but
that
in
no
way
it
seems
to
me
mr.
justice
harlan
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well
the
cassidy
case
was
the
one
that
would
come
within
it.
but
there
are
many
cases
--
there
are
many
cases
that
we
know
of
after
a
personal
knowledge
and
a
couple
of
them
are
decided,
where
there
is
a
delay
where
people
are
prejudiced,
where
people’s
careers
are
hurt
not
only
because
of
the
delay
in
getting
a
job,
not
only
because
of
a
delay
of
earning
money
but
because
of
the
notoriety,
because
of
the
unfortunate
public
publicity.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
do
not
believe
there
should
be
a
character
committee
investigation
that
deals
with
advocacy
or
membership,
or
belief.
i
believe
that
certain
actions
by
an
applicant
maybe
relevant
certain
unlawful
actions
or
certain
improper
actions
of
a
man
that
have
been
convicted
of
embezzlement
from
somebody
or
robbed
a
bank,
or
engaged
in
unlawful
activity,
i
believe
that’s
a
perfectly
proper
subject
for
the
committee
to
delve
into.
mr.
norman
dorsen
this
case
of
course
does
not
present
that
issue.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
think
you’ll
be
entitled
to
raise
that.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
think
that
the
board
would
then
be
entitled
to
make
its
own
independent
investigation.
and
i
might
say
in
the
case
that
mr.
justice
stewart
and
the
chief
justice
are
now
putting,
the
particular
objection
that
mr.
boudin
raised
to
the
fifth
amendment
would
be
inapplicable
because
it
wouldn’t
be
a
case
where
the
fifth
amendment
would
be
closely
related
to
first
amendment
concerns.
and
therefore
the
fifth
amendment
problem
would
not
be
as
great
in
the
first
instance
and
in
the
second
instance
the
committee
certainly
would
be
able
to
follow
that
up.
and
i
see
no
problem
about
considering
that
as
relevant
--
not
the
privilege
against
fifth
amendment,
but
the
unlawful
activity
of
the
individual
should
be
considered
relevant
to
admission
to
the
bar.
but
i
do
not
see
why,
i
do
not
see
why
protected
political
activity,
protected
speech
and
certainly
beliefs
should
be
included
within
the
ambit
of
relevant
consideration,
a
permissible
consideration
by
bar
and
let
me
say
that
one
of
the
chief
reasons
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
yes.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
have
never
heard
that
particular
question
asked.
but
there
are
--
the
questions
that
might
be
asked
are
questions
concerning
possible
crimes.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that’s
right.
if
a
man
has
been
convicted
that’s
a
matter
of
public
record
and
that’s
not
incriminating.
i
do
draw
that
distinction.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
would
say
that’s
an
impermissible
question.
mr.
norman
dorsen
impermissible
question.
i
am
against
courtroom
disruption,
i
believe
all
of
us
are
against
courtroom
disruption.
when
people
engage
in
courtroom
disruption
they
should
be
punished
if
it’s
appropriate
to
do
so
by
the
proper
bodies.
but
this
--
and
i’d
like
to
quote
here
from
what
judge
--
justice
treanor
said,
“when
an
inquiry
begins
into
advocacy”
he
said,
“it’s
a
greedy
camel
and
it
does
not
easily
take
its
lead.”
this
is
a
very,
very
slippery
slope
to
use
the
law
school
phrase,
we
begin
asking
belief
about
one
thing,
we
begin
asking
belief
about
another
thing
and
there’s
no
point
i
can
see
where
a
logical
line
can
be
drawn
if
once
this
line
of
questioning
is
opened
up.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
wouldn’t
go
that
far.
i
wouldn’t
go
quite
that
far.
i
would
stop
showing
to
that
he’s
committed
activity
which
if
a
man
had
for
example
consistently
broken
up
a
courtroom
and
disrupted
a
courtroom
and
had
never
been
convicted
of
it
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
no,
i
mean
as
an
spectator,
for
example,
as
a
law
student.
if
he’d
engaged
in
activity
that
was
--
that
the
committee
properly
found
was
inconsistent,
irrelevant
to
being
a
lawyer,
i
wouldn’t
go
quite
as
far
as
you
suggested
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
norman
dorsen
quite
right.
mr.
norman
dorsen
yes,
i
think
i
would.
mr.
norman
dorsen
yes,
absolutely,
your
honor.
there’s
one
other
point
i
would
like
to
make.
even
more
generally
than
the
--
turning
now
to
section
90
in
the
implementing
question
26,
which
i
won’t
deal
with
specifically,
except
to
say
that
this
question
which
judge
friendly
found
invalid
in
his
opinion
is
still
invalid
because
it
does
not
qualify
membership
by
requiring
active
membership
and
it
does
not
require,
as
the
scales
case
requires
and
it
does
not
qualify
advocacy
by
the
standards
of
the
yates
case
namely
advocacy
to
do
something
or
the
brandenburg
case
to
incite
somebody
as
brandenburg
could.
mr.
norman
dorsen
those
were
all
criminal
cases,
that’s
correct.
but
those
are
the
standards
that
this
court
set
down
as
the
standards
for
deterring
speech
and
association.
now
more
generally,
more
generally
even
section
90
is
invalid
as
applied
because
of
the
entire
mechanism
that
operates
that
enables
committees
to
roam
at
large
over
people’s
belief.
in
the
rosenberg
case
which
i’ve
mentioned
earlier,
it
was
discovered
that
rosenberg
had
taken
place
in
an
anti-vietnam
war
march.
and
a
committee
member
asked
him
during
the
investigation,
“why
are
you
against
the
war
in
vietnam?”
that’s
a
matter
of
public
record.
the
kaimowitz
case
in
which
the
applicant
had
engaged
in
a
strike
was
also
asked,
“why
did
you
strike?
what
was
your
reason
for
doing
so?”
this
is
a
bad
business
when
questions
of
these
kind
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that’s
correct.
mr.
norman
dorsen
they
were
delayed,
their
admission
was
delayed
and
the
specific
point
i
would
like
to
come
to
in
closing
is,
that
nobody
should
be
delayed.
that
nobody
should
be
delayed,
nobody
should
be
prejudiced
because
delay,
while
not
a
serious
as
exclusion
is
also
economic
and
personal
prejudice
until
there’s
a
specific
finding
of
probable
cause
by
the
committee
based
upon
conduct
--
based
upon
conduct
in
noting
moral
(inaudible).
mr.
norman
dorsen
the
proof
of
that
is
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
the
record
only
shows
these
two
cases,
the
cases
of
rosenberg
and
kaimowitz.
but
in
many
first
amendment
cases
there
was
--
let
me
put
it
in
another
way.
these
questions
inquire
into
protected
political
activity,
as
well
as
belief.
the
natural
effect
of
those
questions
is
going
to
deter
activity
and
as
i
stated
at
the
outset
i
have
seen
it
with
my
own
eyes.
i
have
seen
people
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
that’s
correct
that
we’re
asking
that
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
the
kind
f
proof
we
have
is
the
kind
of
proof
for
example
that
the
court
held
satisfactory
in
baggett
and
bullitt
and
several
of
the
oath
cases.
the
natural
effect
of
questions
of
this
kind
which
in
many
cases
cramp,
keyishian,
baggett,
elfbrandt
are
all
cases
where
people
--
where
oaths
were
struck
down
based
upon
the
same
consideration.
mr.
norman
dorsen
the
most
extensive
notes
on
this
subject,
which
contained
whatever
documentation
is
available
or
in
the
columbia
survey
on
human
rights
and
in
the
new
york
university
intramural
law
review,
but
the
record
does
not
contain
the
kind
of
evidence
and
the
answer
is
that
is
the
answer
i
think
i’ve
given,
namely
that
in
cases
like
elfbrandt,
baggett,
and
the
others,
the
chilling
effect
or
the
inhibiting
effect
was
perceived
and
it’s
here,
and
in
my
submission
to
this
court,
i
think
it
also
should
be
perceived
here.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
don’t
state
it
as
a
fact.
i
stated
it
as
the
basis
of
the
precedence
of
this
court
in
both
the
belief
and
speech
areas
that
dealt
with
virtually
the
same
situation.
i
am
not
asking
the
court
to
deviate
at
all
from
the
precedent
that
has
been
developed
over
the
past
decade
and
more.
mr.
norman
dorsen
in
new
york
state,
my
understanding
is
perhaps
mr.
peck
will
--
judge
peck
will
correct
me,
i
think
it
goes
back
to
the
early
1920s,
questions
of
this
general
character.
mr.
norman
dorsen
not
as
elaborate
as
this
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
after
the
first
world
war,
as
we
know,
there
was
a
similar
concern
about
reds
or
the
attorney
general
mitchell
palmer.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
could
not
--
i
could
not
answer
that
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
norman
dorsen
no,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
dorsen
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
this
is
a
third
in
the
succession
of
bar
admission
cases
that
the
court
has
been
hearing.
it’s
an
appeal
from
a
decision
of
a
three-judge
court
to
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
the
suit
in
this
case
was
an
affirmative
suit
brought
by
three
law
students,
three
applicants
to
the
bar
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
three
organizations,
including
a
law
students
civil
rights
research
council,
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
certain
statutes
and
statewide
judicial
rules
governing
the
admission
to
the
new
york
bar.
in
addition,
the
complaint
made
similar
allegations
concerning
the
implementation
of
the
statutes
and
rules
through
questionnaires,
affidavits,
interviews
and
other
practices
i
shall
describe
shortly.
a
majority
of
the
three-judge
court
below,
judges
friendly
and
bonsal
granted
the
appellants
partial
relief,
but
upheld
its
challenge
statutes
and
statewide
judicial
rules.
judge
constance
motley,
in
an
extensive
dissenting
opinion,
took
the
view
that
the
principle
portions
of
the
majority
opinion
were
erroneous
and
she
would
have
broadly
declare
unconstitutional
one
new
york
statute
on
its
face,
and
the
other
as
applied.
it’s
important
for
an
understanding
of
this
case
to
perceive
the
type
of
personal
and
political
screening
program
that
takes
place
in
the
state
of
new
york.
the
statutes
and
judicial
rules
that
are
relevant
are
set
out
in
the
appendix
to
the
brief
for
appellants,
starting
on
page
1a.
section
90
of
the
new
york
judiciary
law
provides,
“the
admission
to
and
removal
from
the
practice
by
the
appellate
division
takes
place
when
the
appellate
division
and
the
state
board
of
law
examiners
are
satisfied
that
each
person
who
passes
the
bar
exam,
possess
the
character
and
general
fitness
requisite
for
an
attorney
and
counselor
at
law.”
rule
81,
immediately
underneath
section
90
on
page
3a
of
the
appendix
provides,
this
is
an
implementing
rule
that
has
the
effect
of
a
statute,
“that
each
applicant
to
the
bar
must
produce
before
a
committee
a
character
and
fitness
evidence
that
he
possess
the
good
moral
character
and
general
fitness
requisite
for
an
attorney.”
on
the
facing
page,
page
2a,
is
rule
9406
which
provides
“that
no
person
shall
receive
a
certificate
from
any
committee,
any
bar
committee
and
no
person
shall
be
admitted
to
practice
as
an
attorney
unless
he
shall
furnish
satisfactory
proof
to
the
effect
among
other
things
that
he
believes
in
the
form
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
and
is
loyal
to
such
government”
and
there
are
three
other
requirements
including
citizenship
and
residence.
now,
these
standards
for
admissions
in
the
state
of
new
york
are
implemented
by
a
complex
procedural
mechanisms
that
delves
deeply
into
the
political
and
personal
lives
of
each
applicant.
i
shall
be
more
specific
about
this
later.
it
will
suffice
to
say
now
that
each
applicant
must
answer
extended
questionnaires
that
raise
questions
regarding
every
aspect
of
his
life.
secondly,
there
are
so-called
home
life
affidavits
which
must
be
submitted
to
the
bar
committee
by
persons
who
know
the
applicant
personally
and
have
visited
in
his
home.
third,
there
are
independent
investigations
that
take
place,
including
inquiries
of
the
applicant’s
school
and
draft
board,
his
former
employers
and
to
police
and
other
agencies,
as
well
as
the
general
public
through
publication
in
the
new
york
law
journal.
finally,
after
all
the
information
is
reviewed
by
a
committee
member,
a
personal
interview
takes
place.
if
there
is
nothing
unorthodox
about
an
applicant,
the
interview
will
be
perfunctory
and
admission
will
follow
almost
automatically.
but
if
there
some
unorthodox
political
activity
or
associations,
there
is
an
intensified
investigation,
new
interviews,
new
questions
and
sometimes
a
delay
in
admission
at
personal
and
professional
cost
to
the
applicant.
all
these
takes
place
at
a
low
level
of
visibility,
but
the
effect
on
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
applicant
is
destructive.
first,
it
involves
an
unwarranted
intrusion
broadly
into
their
political
and
personal
privacy
and
secondly,
it
inhibits
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights
by
law
students
and
applicants
because
of
a
fear
of
delay
in
admission.
all
this
is
destructive
to
them,
it’s
also
destructive
to
the
national
interest
as
i
shall
try
to
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
there
are
--
this
case
involves
the
second
department
and
the
first
department,
but
there
are
questionnaires
in
all
four
departments.
mr.
norman
dorsen
very
similar.
the
three-judge
court
below
unanimously
agreed
in
an
opinion
by
judge
friendly
that
certain
practices
of
the
bar
committees
were
invalid.
they
held
question
27(a),
which
ask
applicants,
“do
you
believe
in
the
principles
of
the
form
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
to
be
impermissibly
vague
and
overbroad?”
it
held
question
26
also
invalid.
that
question
dealt
and
currently
deals
with
membership
in
organizations
advocating
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
judge
friendly
held
that
the
question
is
at
formally
provided
was
invalid
because
it
did
not
require
knowledge
by
the
applicant
of
the
illegal
purposes
of
the
organization
and
there
was
no
requirement
that
the
illegal
activity
of
the
organization
be
coincident
with
the
membership
of
the
individual.
finally,
judge
friendly
held
invalid
question
31,
which
formally
inquired
whether
there
was
any
incident
in
your
life,
the
life
of
the
applicant,
that
was
called
for
by
the
forgoing
questions
on
the
questionnaire,
which
has
any
favorable
or
detrimental
bearing
on
your
character
or
fitness
and
judge
friendly
held
that
this
kind
of
soul-searching
question
was
too
broad
and
he
struck
it
down.
at
the
same
time,
the
defendants
themselves
deleted
certain
questions
from
their
questionnaire
and
what
judge
motley
termed
the
tacit
confession
of
error.
these
extremely
broad
questions,
which
are
found
on
page
183
of
the
record,
dealt
broadly
with
membership
in
organizations
and
societies
that
the
applicant
may
have
joined
before
and
during
law
school
and
extra
curricular
activities
that
he
engaged
in
or
may
have
engaged
in
while
a
student,
but
the
majority
below
upheld
the
two
relevant
new
york
statutes
and
the
implementing
questions.
we
have
many
objections,
both
to
the
statutes
and
the
questions
and
the
implementing
procedures,
but
they
boil
down
to
two
principle
points.
the
first
point
is
that
section
9
--
rule
9406,
which
is
on
2a
of
the
appendix,
and
the
implementing
question,
question
27,
are
invalid
because
they
compel
a
declaration
of
belief
and
are
impermissibly
vague.
second,
that
section
90
of
the
judiciary
law,
the
good
moral
character
standard,
which
incidentally
we
do
not
dispute
on
its
face
because
we
accept
judge,
justice
frankfurter’s
for
this
formulation
of
the
good
moral
character
standard
as
mr.
boudin
stated
yesterday
from
the
schware
case.
but
we
do
maintain
that
section
90
has
been
invalidly
applied
because
it’s
been
used
to
test
the
political
ideas
of
the
applicants
that
are
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
both
because
of
the
invalidity
of
the
revised
question
26,
which
is
found
in
page
6a
of
the
appendix
and
because
of
the
impermissibly
broad
pattern
of
investigation
into
protected
activity
that
the
bar
committees
undertake.
now,
before
turning
to
my
first
point,
i
would
like
very
briefly
to
make
four
preliminary
comments
that
are
central
to
an
understanding
of
our
position.
the
first
concerns
the
deterrent
effect
on
a
political
activity
of
students.
i
have
seen
this
for
10
years
at
new
york
university
law
school.
this
is
not
an
imagination,
this
is
not
a
product
of
anyone’s
imagination,
it
is
not
a
chimerical
allegation.
there
are
students
who
are
deterred
from
political
activity.
there
are
professors
who
tell
students
not
to
engage
in
political
activity
until
they’re
members
of
the
bar.
some
of
the
most
responsible
students,
some
of
the
best
students
are
deterred
from
lawful
political
activity.
many
of
these
students
and
the
families
of
these
students
have
gone
to
great
extent
to
put
them
through
law
school,
even
a
delay
of
a
few
months
in
earning
a
living
is
relevant
to
the
prospects
of
their
families
and
their
own
prospects.
the
two
cases
that
are
cited
in
the
brief,
the
cases
of
messrs
rosenberg
and
kaimowitz
are
examples
of
people
who
have
been
delayed
by
the
character
committee
for
engaging
an
undoubted
political
activity.
secondly,
nothing
that
is
being
urged
here
in
any
sense
is
inconsistent
with
the
ability
of
the
bar
and
the
courts
to
discipline
improper
conduct
of
applicants
or
members
of
the
bar.
mr.
boudin
has
reviewed
four
different
types
of
sanctions
that
are
available
and
i
shall
not
repeat
them,
but
i
will
deal
with
one
other
aspect.
every
one
of
us
is
concern
by
violence,
everyone
of
us
is
concern
by
disruption
in
courtrooms.
in
my
experience,
the
bar
associations
of
this
country
are
able
to
respond
to
this
problem
in
a
constitutional
manner.
the
aba
has
setup
a
special
committee
under
judge
murray
and
who’s
a
member
of
the
district
court
in
the
first
circuit,
to
set
standards
for
behavior
by
judges,
by
lawyers,
by
spectators
and
by
defendants.
that
committee
has
already
issued
a
preliminary
report.
the
bar
association
of
the
city
of
new
york
has
setup
a
special
committee
with
men
like
bruce
bromley,
best
webster,
george
lindsey
and
burk
marshall
on
the
committee
to
look
into
the
same
matter.
i
have
the
privilege
of
being
the
executive
director
of
that
study.
the
bar
association
has
not
been
delinquent.
the
bar
associations
of
this
country
are
able
to
deal
with
conduct
that
is
impermissible,
conduct
that
deserves
the
sanction
of
either
the
bar
or
the
court.
but
this
is
not
conduct
we’re
dealing
with
here,
it’s
the
delving
into
protected
political
activity.
third,
none
of
the
criticisms
of
the
statute,
none
of
the
criticisms
of
the
questions,
none
of
the
criticisms
of
the
practices
that
we’re
making
here
are
meant
in
a
slightest
to
impute
a
good
faith,
the
integrity
of
the
members
of
the
bar
committees,
the
members
of
the
courts
of
new
york
or
any
other
state.
these
men
are
operating
under
a
system
that
was
handed
to
them.
they
are
doing
their
very
best
to
implement
that
system,
but
it’s
a
system
that
was
setup
without
full
consciousness
of
the
first
amendment
problems
that
are
raised.
i
want
to
repeat,
we’re
not
criticizing
individuals,
we’re
not
suggesting
that
there’s
a
certain
venality
or
arbitrariness
on
the
part
of
particular
people
or
committees.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
a
structure
has
been
setup
that’s
improper
and
it
should
be
dealt
with.
mr.
norman
dorsen
the
record
shows
the
history
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
the
history
shows
--
the
record
shows
the
previous
questions
that
were
asked
and
the
present
questions.
the
new
york’s
system
was
setup
in
1921.
it
traces
back
to
1921
--
questions
of
this
time
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
but
this
kind
of
investigation.
mr.
norman
dorsen
it
does
not.
it
does
not
mr.
justice.
the
final
preliminary
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
there’s
no
need
for
this
court
to
overrule
the
konigsberg
and
estoppel
cases
to
deal
with
the
invalid
statutes
and
practices
here.
the
question
in
the
konigsberg
was
a
different
kind
of
question
from
the
question
that
is
being
asked
of
the
applicants
in
new
york.
the
foundation
for
the
question
as
mr.
justice
harlan
pointed
out
in
both
opinions
in
those
cases
had
been
laid
and
the
committee
was
trying
to
fill
in
gaps.
there
are
no
gaps
here,
there
is
no
foundation
here.
we’re
dealing
here
with
questions
that
are
being
asked
of
every
single
applicant
to
the
new
york
bar.
the
entire
generation
of
lawyers,
they
are
going
to
have
deal
with
the
problems
that
all
of
us
are
dealing
with
at
the
present
time.
and
finally,
konigsberg
and
estoppel
are
distinguishable
of
course,
because
the
governing
constitutional
principles
that
have
evolve
--
have
been
evolved
by
this
court
have
changed
in
last
decade.
it’s
exactly
decades
as
the
konigsberg
case
was
argued
in
this
court.
now,
what
i
would
like
to
do
is
deal
with
the
first
principle
point
that
i
alluded
to
earlier,
namely
rule
9406,
which
is
found
at
page
2a
of
the
appendix.
and
here
we
have
a
rule
which
is
of
statewide
applicability
and
has
the
force
of
the
statute
that
whatever
the
doubts
may
have
been
in
the
arizona
case
that
mr.
justice
white
raised,
this
is
a
belief
question.
it
is
clear
that
each
person
who
wants
to
be
a
member
of
the
bar
must
furnish
satisfactory
proof
to
the
effect
that
he
believes
in
the
form
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
and
is
loyal
to
that
government.
and
there
are
many
expressions
by
members
of
this
court.
mr.
justice
robert’s
memorable
quote
was
referred
to
yesterday
by
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
justice
jackson
on
another
occasion
expressed
what
seems
to
me
the
most
cogent
terms,
the
reasons
why
belief
is
absolutely
inviolable.
mr.
norman
dorsen
no
i
did
not.
the
constitutional
oath
that
was
raised
in
the
knight
case,
it
was
affirmed
pre
curiam
by
this
court,
we
have
to
objection
to
at
all,
but
this
is
not
that
case.
this
deals
with
belief
and
as
mr.
justice
jackson
said,
“i
know
of
no
situation
in
which
a
citizen
may
incur
a
civil
or
criminal
liability
or
disability
because
a
court
infers
an
evil
mental
state
where
no
act
at
all
has
occurred.
attempts
of
the
court
to
fathom
modern
political
meditations
would
be
as
futile
and
mischievous
as
the
efforts
of
the
infamous
heresy
trials
of
old
that
fathomed
religious
beliefs.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that
--
i
think
that’s
a
very,
very
basic
question
and
our
second
objection
to
this
standard
is
that’s
impermissibly
vague.
it
talks
about
the
form
of
the
government,
a
form
of
the
government
of
the
united
states.
does
this
mean
the
electoral
system?
does
this
mean
the
capitalist
system?
does
this
mean
the
federal
system?
the
center
for
democratic
studies
under
mr.
hudson
(ph)
has
recently
proposed
a
new
constitution,
which
would
divide
the
country
into
regions,
which
would
give
different
powers
to
the
supreme
court.
that
would
certainly
change
our
form
of
government.
does
an
applicant
to
be
in
a
position
where
he
has
to
guess
if
he
has
unorthodox
political
views
as
to
what
the
form
of
government
of
united
states
really
is
or
what
a
judge
or
jury
might
consider
it
to
be
and
judge
friendly
dealt
with
this
point.
he
said
that
it
was
wrong
and
improper
to
inquire
of
an
applicant
as
to
whether
he
was
loyal
to
the
principles
underlying
the
form
of
government.
he
did
not
explain
why
the
same
objections
did
not
apply
to
the
slightly
shorter
formulation,
but
it
seems
to
me
indistinguishable
formulation,
a
form
of
government
of
the
united
states.
and
judge
motley
in
her
dissent
raised
this
very
question,
and
as
far
as
i
know
there’s
nothing
in
judge
friendly’s
opinion
which
satisfactory
deals
with
this
issue
for
the
very
reason
suggested
by
the
chief
justice.
now,
the
state
says
that
section
9406
is
really
like
the
constitutional
oath
that
mr.
justice
harlan
raised
in
connection
with
the
members
of
the
bar
who
just
admitted
that
one
will
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
but
that’s
not
what
this
says.
that’s
just
not
what
it
says.
there’s
no
warrant
to
revise
this
formulation
in
light
of
what
would
be
a
constitutional
formulation
especially
is
this
true
in
light
of
question
27,
which
implements
this
section
and
says
among
other
things,
“can
you
conscientiously
and
do
you
affirm
that
you
are,
without
any
mental
reservation
loyal
to
and
ready
to
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states?”
now,
the
“without
any
mental
reservation”
clause
is
certainly
a
belief
clause.
mental
reservation
--
a
man
may
have
a
question
about
the
bicameral
system,
about
one
man
one
vote,
about
whether
or
not
in
this
modern
age
we
need
regional
government
rather
than
state
government.
now,
this
section
or
this
rule
9406,
the
implementing
question
are
invalid
for
a
wholly
distinct
reason
and
that
is
under
speiser
and
randall,
it
impermissibly
places
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
applicant.
judge
motley
said
on
her
opinion
that
this
was
the
very
heart
of
the
case
and
the
reason
judge
motley
thought
this
was
the
very
heart
of
the
case
is
spelled
out
fully
in
justice
brennan’s
opinion
in
the
speiser
case.
and
that
is
that
the
hazard
of
mistaken
fact
finding
is
so
great
and
a
potential
loss
to
the
applicant
and
the
law
student
is
so
great
that
he
will
steer
far
wider
of
the
unlawful
zone
if
he
has
the
burden
of
proof.
now
in
its
brief,
the
state
attempts
to
avoid
the
thrust
of
speiser
without
even
mentioning
the
case
by
saying
that
there’s
a
distinction
between
coming
forward
with
evidence,
the
burden
of
initial
coming
forward
on
the
one
hand
and
the
burden
of
ultimate
proof
on
the
other.
it
seems
to
us
that
this
is
an
inadequate
answer.
in
the
first
place
the
language
of
rule
9406
says
explicitly
that
the
applicant
must
furnish
satisfactory
proof.
the
burden
of
proof
is
built
in
to
the
section.
secondly,
the
practical
implementation
of
this
section
in
new
york
as
both
the
kaimowitz
and
the
rosenberg
cases
which
are
cited
incidentally
on
page
10
of
the
brief
in
opposition
to
the
motion
to
affirm
show
that
the
way
the
mechanism
works
and
very
naturally
works
is
that
when
there’s
a
question
about
an
applicant,
as
the
gentleman
from
ohio
said
a
moment
ago,
more
questions
are
asked
until
the
bar
committee
is
satisfied.
and
of
course,
under
section
90,
at
the
top
of
page
3a
of
the
appendix,
it
says
that
the
state
board
of
law
examiners
must
be
satisfied.
now,
that’s
burden
of
proof
language
and
i
might
add
that
despite
what
new
york
says
here,
in
the
konigsberg
opinion
itself
at
366
us,
page
41
in
the
footnote,
mr.
justice
harlan
lists
new
york
state
as
among
the
states
where
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
applicant.
so,
it
seems
to
us
that
apart
from
the
defects
that
are
inherent
in
the
rule
and
the
implementing
question,
the
burden
of
proof
problems
that
are
raised
by
speiser
and
randall
are
all
together
supportive
of
our
concern.
mr.
norman
dorsen
the
one
case
which
deals
with
this
is
the
cassidy
case
which
is
cited
in
the
brief
and
is
unclear
whether
that
person
was
denied
admission
because
of
a
political
matter
or
because
of
a
deception
that
he
played
upon
the
committee.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
there
were
very
few
people
who
were
denied
admission
to
the
bar
on
political
grounds,
but
that
in
no
way
it
seems
to
me
mr.
justice
harlan
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well
the
cassidy
case
was
the
one
that
would
come
within
it.
but
there
are
many
cases
--
there
are
many
cases
that
we
know
of
after
a
personal
knowledge
and
a
couple
of
them
are
decided,
where
there
is
a
delay
where
people
are
prejudiced,
where
people’s
careers
are
hurt
not
only
because
of
the
delay
in
getting
a
job,
not
only
because
of
a
delay
of
earning
money
but
because
of
the
notoriety,
because
of
the
unfortunate
public
publicity.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
do
not
believe
there
should
be
a
character
committee
investigation
that
deals
with
advocacy
or
membership,
or
belief.
i
believe
that
certain
actions
by
an
applicant
maybe
relevant
certain
unlawful
actions
or
certain
improper
actions
of
a
man
that
have
been
convicted
of
embezzlement
from
somebody
or
robbed
a
bank,
or
engaged
in
unlawful
activity,
i
believe
that’s
a
perfectly
proper
subject
for
the
committee
to
delve
into.
mr.
norman
dorsen
this
case
of
course
does
not
present
that
issue.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
think
you’ll
be
entitled
to
raise
that.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
think
that
the
board
would
then
be
entitled
to
make
its
own
independent
investigation.
and
i
might
say
in
the
case
that
mr.
justice
stewart
and
the
chief
justice
are
now
putting,
the
particular
objection
that
mr.
boudin
raised
to
the
fifth
amendment
would
be
inapplicable
because
it
wouldn’t
be
a
case
where
the
fifth
amendment
would
be
closely
related
to
first
amendment
concerns.
and
therefore
the
fifth
amendment
problem
would
not
be
as
great
in
the
first
instance
and
in
the
second
instance
the
committee
certainly
would
be
able
to
follow
that
up.
and
i
see
no
problem
about
considering
that
as
relevant
--
not
the
privilege
against
fifth
amendment,
but
the
unlawful
activity
of
the
individual
should
be
considered
relevant
to
admission
to
the
bar.
but
i
do
not
see
why,
i
do
not
see
why
protected
political
activity,
protected
speech
and
certainly
beliefs
should
be
included
within
the
ambit
of
relevant
consideration,
a
permissible
consideration
by
bar
and
let
me
say
that
one
of
the
chief
reasons
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
yes.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
have
never
heard
that
particular
question
asked.
but
there
are
--
the
questions
that
might
be
asked
are
questions
concerning
possible
crimes.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that’s
right.
if
a
man
has
been
convicted
that’s
a
matter
of
public
record
and
that’s
not
incriminating.
i
do
draw
that
distinction.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
would
say
that’s
an
impermissible
question.
mr.
norman
dorsen
impermissible
question.
i
am
against
courtroom
disruption,
i
believe
all
of
us
are
against
courtroom
disruption.
when
people
engage
in
courtroom
disruption
they
should
be
punished
if
it’s
appropriate
to
do
so
by
the
proper
bodies.
but
this
--
and
i’d
like
to
quote
here
from
what
judge
--
justice
treanor
said,
“when
an
inquiry
begins
into
advocacy”
he
said,
“it’s
a
greedy
camel
and
it
does
not
easily
take
its
lead.”
this
is
a
very,
very
slippery
slope
to
use
the
law
school
phrase,
we
begin
asking
belief
about
one
thing,
we
begin
asking
belief
about
another
thing
and
there’s
no
point
i
can
see
where
a
logical
line
can
be
drawn
if
once
this
line
of
questioning
is
opened
up.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
wouldn’t
go
that
far.
i
wouldn’t
go
quite
that
far.
i
would
stop
showing
to
that
he’s
committed
activity
which
if
a
man
had
for
example
consistently
broken
up
a
courtroom
and
disrupted
a
courtroom
and
had
never
been
convicted
of
it
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
no,
i
mean
as
an
spectator,
for
example,
as
a
law
student.
if
he’d
engaged
in
activity
that
was
--
that
the
committee
properly
found
was
inconsistent,
irrelevant
to
being
a
lawyer,
i
wouldn’t
go
quite
as
far
as
you
suggested
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
norman
dorsen
quite
right.
mr.
norman
dorsen
yes,
i
think
i
would.
mr.
norman
dorsen
yes,
absolutely,
your
honor.
there’s
one
other
point
i
would
like
to
make.
even
more
generally
than
the
--
turning
now
to
section
90
in
the
implementing
question
26,
which
i
won’t
deal
with
specifically,
except
to
say
that
this
question
which
judge
friendly
found
invalid
in
his
opinion
is
still
invalid
because
it
does
not
qualify
membership
by
requiring
active
membership
and
it
does
not
require,
as
the
scales
case
requires
and
it
does
not
qualify
advocacy
by
the
standards
of
the
yates
case
namely
advocacy
to
do
something
or
the
brandenburg
case
to
incite
somebody
as
brandenburg
could.
mr.
norman
dorsen
those
were
all
criminal
cases,
that’s
correct.
but
those
are
the
standards
that
this
court
set
down
as
the
standards
for
deterring
speech
and
association.
now
more
generally,
more
generally
even
section
90
is
invalid
as
applied
because
of
the
entire
mechanism
that
operates
that
enables
committees
to
roam
at
large
over
people’s
belief.
in
the
rosenberg
case
which
i’ve
mentioned
earlier,
it
was
discovered
that
rosenberg
had
taken
place
in
an
anti-vietnam
war
march.
and
a
committee
member
asked
him
during
the
investigation,
“why
are
you
against
the
war
in
vietnam?”
that’s
a
matter
of
public
record.
the
kaimowitz
case
in
which
the
applicant
had
engaged
in
a
strike
was
also
asked,
“why
did
you
strike?
what
was
your
reason
for
doing
so?”
this
is
a
bad
business
when
questions
of
these
kind
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that’s
correct.
mr.
norman
dorsen
they
were
delayed,
their
admission
was
delayed
and
the
specific
point
i
would
like
to
come
to
in
closing
is,
that
nobody
should
be
delayed.
that
nobody
should
be
delayed,
nobody
should
be
prejudiced
because
delay,
while
not
a
serious
as
exclusion
is
also
economic
and
personal
prejudice
until
there’s
a
specific
finding
of
probable
cause
by
the
committee
based
upon
conduct
--
based
upon
conduct
in
noting
moral
(inaudible).
mr.
norman
dorsen
the
proof
of
that
is
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
the
record
only
shows
these
two
cases,
the
cases
of
rosenberg
and
kaimowitz.
but
in
many
first
amendment
cases
there
was
--
let
me
put
it
in
another
way.
these
questions
inquire
into
protected
political
activity,
as
well
as
belief.
the
natural
effect
of
those
questions
is
going
to
deter
activity
and
as
i
stated
at
the
outset
i
have
seen
it
with
my
own
eyes.
i
have
seen
people
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
that’s
correct
that
we’re
asking
that
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
the
kind
f
proof
we
have
is
the
kind
of
proof
for
example
that
the
court
held
satisfactory
in
baggett
and
bullitt
and
several
of
the
oath
cases.
the
natural
effect
of
questions
of
this
kind
which
in
many
cases
cramp,
keyishian,
baggett,
elfbrandt
are
all
cases
where
people
--
where
oaths
were
struck
down
based
upon
the
same
consideration.
mr.
norman
dorsen
the
most
extensive
notes
on
this
subject,
which
contained
whatever
documentation
is
available
or
in
the
columbia
survey
on
human
rights
and
in
the
new
york
university
intramural
law
review,
but
the
record
does
not
contain
the
kind
of
evidence
and
the
answer
is
that
is
the
answer
i
think
i’ve
given,
namely
that
in
cases
like
elfbrandt,
baggett,
and
the
others,
the
chilling
effect
or
the
inhibiting
effect
was
perceived
and
it’s
here,
and
in
my
submission
to
this
court,
i
think
it
also
should
be
perceived
here.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
don’t
state
it
as
a
fact.
i
stated
it
as
the
basis
of
the
precedence
of
this
court
in
both
the
belief
and
speech
areas
that
dealt
with
virtually
the
same
situation.
i
am
not
asking
the
court
to
deviate
at
all
from
the
precedent
that
has
been
developed
over
the
past
decade
and
more.
mr.
norman
dorsen
in
new
york
state,
my
understanding
is
perhaps
mr.
peck
will
--
judge
peck
will
correct
me,
i
think
it
goes
back
to
the
early
1920s,
questions
of
this
general
character.
mr.
norman
dorsen
not
as
elaborate
as
this
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
after
the
first
world
war,
as
we
know,
there
was
a
similar
concern
about
reds
or
the
attorney
general
mitchell
palmer.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
could
not
--
i
could
not
answer
that
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
norman
dorsen
no,
your
honor.
