is
this
questionnaire
used
in
all
departments?
this
is
the
second
department.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
of
the
same
character?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
think
that
the
oath
that
you
heard
these
applicants
who
are
admitted
and
are
barred
today
thought
to
have
raised
these
questions
(inaudible)?
justice
john
m.
harlan
have
you
got
any
figures
as
you
can
see
the
papers
that
goes
with
this
as
to
how
many
applicants
to
the
bar
have
been
denied
admission
since
this
questionnaire
(inaudible)?
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
there
any
that
you
could
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
go
as
far
as
mr.
boudin
does
to
press
the
argument
when
he
said
that
he’d
like
to
see
(inaudible)
that
there
should
be
no
character
committee
examination?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
would
you
say
about
a
committee
asking
whether
applicants
of
the
bar
believed
in
courtroom
disruption?
justice
john
m.
harlan
impermissible
question.
justice
john
m.
harlan
really,
really
what
you
are
saying
to
make
it
concrete
is,
you
can’t
keep
a
man
out
of
the
bar
unless
you
can
show
he
has
committed
a
crime?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
he
wouldn’t
get
into
a
courtroom
before
he
is
admitted
(inaudible).
justice
john
m.
harlan
those
were
all
criminal
cases?
justice
john
m.
harlan
then
i
go
back
to
something
that
i
understand
you
were
saying
at
the
beginning.
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
effect
of
this
very
complicated
questionnaire
was
really
to
suppress
political
beliefs,
what’s
proof
of
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
what
proof
does
the
record
show?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
know
what
you’re
--
after
all
it’s
not
in
the
record
either.
one
can
imagine
those
things
don’t
question
your
sincerity
for
the
(inaudible)
but
still
we’re
dealing
with
restriction
and
broad
restriction
you’re
asking
(inaudible)
long
traditional
system
in
new
york
and
other
places.
justice
john
m.
harlan
therefore,
i
would
suppose
if
there’s
some
proof
beyond
the
chilling
effect?
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
it
be
possible,
would
it
be
trustful,
can
you
refer
to
a
standing,
any
compilation
that
we
could
get
to
see
how
many
people,
since
this
questionnaire
was
introduced,
have
been
refused
admission
on
the
basis
of
their
character.
justice
john
m.
harlan
a
one
man
character
committee?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
think
judge
peck,
that
as
far
as
the
rulings
of
judge
friendly
on
the
specific
questions
that
he
held
were
improper,
you’re
not
quarreling
with
those
rulings?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
suppose
the
oath
that
we
take,
you
probably
took
it
at
one
stage,
that
we
support
--
to
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
by
member
reservation
purpose
of
evasion
might
have
the
same
fairness?
