justice

black

justice

l.
black
now,
you
get
down
to
a
question
that
has
little
more
significance
than
some
of
the
others,
but
suppose
a
man
had
sworn
that
he
didn’t
belong
to
any
organization
which
believed
in
the
overthrow,
indict
him
for
perjury,
then
would
the
issue
in
that
case
be
whether
or
not
that
organization
was
advocating
the
overthrow
of
the
government
and
who
would
have
the
burden
of
proof
on
it?
justice
hugo

but
who
would
it
prove
it
to?
justice
hugo

it
might
have
a
million

well,
how
would
you
prove
that
he
advocated
it,
put
that
issue
to
the
jury
in
a
man’s
trial
for
perjury,
what
should
be
doing
is
to
try
the
mccarthy
line
cases
in
a

charge
against
perjury
against
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
would
be
the
issue
to
be
tried
on
a
perjury
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
get
right
back
into
the
old
mccarthy
days?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but,
it
certainly
is
a
step
in
that
direction,
is
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
raising
the
same
question
that
he
was
raising
and
of
course,
it
wouldn’t
be
difficult
to
prove
that
some
of
the
things
that
might
have
to
prove
to
convict
him
with
perjury.
if
they
showed
by
six
witnesses
that
some
of
them
said
that
was
the
purpose
they
understood
the
organization
was
organized
for,
then
he
would
have
to
overcome
that
wouldn’t
he,
by
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don’t?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where’s
they
showed
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
had
a
foreign
name
and
he
was
tried
by
jury,
they
prove
by
six
or
seven
witnesses
that
they
had
told
him,
what
you
said
they
had.
now
how
difficult
might
it
be
for
him
to
show
to
the
jury
that
he
hadn’t,
that
they
were
wrong?
why
does
the
bar
associations
have
to
get
mixed
up
and
involved
in
all
of
that
issue
and
simply
determine
good
character
of
a
human
being
who
wants
to
be
lawyer,
which
ought
to
be
done?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but,
i
haven’t
object
--
i
haven’t
asked
you
about
that.
i
took
oath,
i’m
glad
of
it.
i
want
to
do
it,
on
both
sides.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
why
should
they
--
why
should
in
order
to
show
that
after
subject
him
to
the
possibility
of
a
trial
for
perjury
on
issues
involving
the
advocacy
of
a

how
could
he
involve

escape
having
to
defend
himself
on

if
someone
happen
to
be

him?
justice

he
might
say
i

black
have
you
belong

that

justice

alright,

so,
they
subject
him
to
a
trial
for
perjury
on
that
issue
about
an
organization,
as
to
whether
it
believed
in
overthrowing
the
government.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
and
he
knew
it,
we’ll
take
them
both,
take
them
both,
get
him
on
the
right
environment,
with
the
right
jury,
in
the
right
locality,
with
the
right
prosecutors,
and
with
the
right

justice

l.
black
he
has
more
serious
ones,
when
it’s
on
an
issue
that
a
subject
to
the
sharpest
political
divisions,
and
while
the

are
talking
about
are
some
that
the
vast

are
vigorously
against,
does
he
not?
justice
hugo

and
they
provide
for
changes
of
venue
and
everything.
justice

some
of
these
you
couldn’t
provide
for
changes
that
you
hold
very
easily.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
you
get
into?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
one
are
you
going
to
get,
when
there's
a
lot
of
talking
about
reds
and
the
communists?
you
would
expect
to
have
a
community
that
was
looking
too
sharply
if
they
had
somebody
to
say
that
man
had
done
something
to
help
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
don’t
have
to
make
certain
things
a
crime,
with
reference
to
what
a
man
believes
or
what
organizations
he
belong
to

what
they
believed

advocated?
justice

and
--
justice

have
you
been
a
member
of
this
organization

an
organization
which
advocated
to
overthrow
the

justice
hugo

black
as
you
know
that
there
are
very,
very
many
people
who
refuse
any
political
party
in
this
country
of
being
on
one
side
or
the
other
of
that
issue.
i
presume
that
they
would
have
to
deny
belonging
to
the
party,
political
party.
to
be
safe
--
justice

may
i
ask
you
just
one
other
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
get
ground
to
the
root
of
the
matter?
do
you
believe
the
bar
ought
to
have
a
right
to
deny
a
man
admission,
because
he’s
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
that’s
the
issue
really?

justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
been
a
member
of
this
organization
and
an
organization
which
advocated
to
overthrow
the
government?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
you
know
that
there
are
very,
very
many
people
who
refuse
any
political
party
in
this
country
of
being
on
one
side
or
the
other
of
that
issue.
i
presume
that
they
would
have
to
deny
belonging
to
the
party,
political
party.

be
safe

justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
just
one
other
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
get
ground
to
the
root
of
the
matter?
do
you
believe
the
bar
ought
to
have
a
right
to
deny
a
man
admission,
because
he’s
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
that’s
the
issue
really?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
he
was
a
member
at
the
time
he
applied?
justice
hugo
l.
black
applicant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
applicant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
now,
that’s
quite
different
to
the
question,
i
asked
you
that
the
applicant
has
it?
