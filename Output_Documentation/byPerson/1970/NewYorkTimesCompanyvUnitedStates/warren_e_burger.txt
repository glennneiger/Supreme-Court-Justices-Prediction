e.

mr.
solicitor
general,
the
government’s
motion
to
conduct
part
of
the
oral
arguments
involving
security
matters
in-camera,
as
has
been
done
in
the
district
court’s
of
new
york
and
in
washington
and
in
the
courts
of
appeals,
in
the
second
circuit
and
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
is
denied
for
the
court.
mr.
justice
harlan,
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
i
would
grant
a
limited
in-camera
argument
as
has
been
done
in
all
the
hearings
in
these
cases
until
now.
under
the
order,
granting
the
writ
yesterday,
counsel
may,
if
they
wish,
submit
arguments
in
writing
under
seal
in
lieu
of
the
in-camera
oral
argument.
mr.
solicitor
general
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
these
matters
last
filed
are
security
matters
or
they
merely
supplement
and
explain
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
see,
thank
you
very
much.
i
just
wanted
to
be
sure
as
to
these
last
documents.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
seymour
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
court
would
have
done
a
job
for
you,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
declassify
the
fact.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
solicitor
general.
mr.
bickel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
mr.
bickel,
aren’t
you
--
aren’t
you
going
to
allow
sometime
for
some
of
the
--
really
see
what
this
means
before
they
act?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
meetings
drawn
and
get
lawyers
into
the
courts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
professor
bickel,
let
me
alter
the
illustration
a
little
bit,
the
hypothetical.
suppose
the
information
was
sufficient.
the
judges
could
be
satisfied
that
the
disclosure
of
a
link,
the
identity
of
the
person
engaged
in
delicate
negotiations
having
to
do
with
the
possible
release
of
prisoners
of
war,
the
disclosure
of
this
would
delay
the
release
of
those
prisoners
before
a
substantial
period
of
time.
now
this
and
i’m
posing
that
so
that
it
is
not
immediate,
is
that
or
is
that
not
in
your
view
of
matter
that
should
stop
the
publication
and
therefore
avoid
the
delay
and
the
release
of
the
prisoners?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
get
a
feeling
from
which
you
have
said,
although
you
haven’t
addressed
yourself
directly
to
it
that
you
do
not
weigh
heavily
or
i
think
the
courts
should
weigh
heavily
the
impairment
of
sources
of
information
either
diplomatic
or
military
intelligent
sources.
now
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
get
the
impression
that
you
wouldn’t
consider
that
enough
to
warrant
the
--
an
injunction.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then
let
me
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
make
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
professor
bickel,
i
have
one
question
that’s
prompted
by
this
exchange.
generally
speaking,
there
are,
as
i
understand
it,
no
statute
is
granting
immunity
to
newspaper
reporters
from
disclosing
their
sources,
but
there
is
a
firm
claim
made
by
newspapers,
by
reporters
and
there
have
been
a
number
of
cases
on
that.
if
i
read
the
briefs
and
the
accounts
of
those
other
cases
in
california
and
several
other
places,
claim
of
the
newspaper
is
that
the
first
amendment
protects
them
from
revealing
their
source
even
to
a
grand
jury
in
the
investigation
of
criminal
matters
because
otherwise,
the
newspaper
sources
would
dry
up.
now,
that’s
generally
the
thesis
of
the
press,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
but
the
argument
then
is
that
the
newspapers,
newspaper
reporters
claim
for
themselves
a
right
which
this
argument
now
would
deny
to
the
government?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
mr.
glendon.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
anyone
know
in
any
circumstance
the
consequences
of
disclosure
of
sources
of
information
for
example,
the
upsetting
of
negotiations
if
that
were
hypothetically
true
in
paris
or
possible
negotiations
that
we
don’t
know
anything
about,
for
the
release
of
war
prisoners,
that
sort
of
thing.
how
does
a
government
meet
the
burden
of
proof
in
the
sense
that
judge
gesell
laid
it
down.
that
doesn’t
bring
any
battleships
to
the
outer
limits
of
new
york
harbor
or
set
off
any
missiles
but
would
you
say
that
it’s
not
a
very
grave
matter?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
it
show,
if
you
know
how
long
when
there
are
times
have
the
documents
in
their
possession
before
the
post
got
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
got
that
impression
somewhere,
three
to
four
months.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
course
it
could
be
that
something
classified
in
1965
and
properly
but
be
no
longer
subject
to
classification
or
even
69
or
70,
isn't
that
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
there
an
order
at
anytime
to
produce
all
the
documents
in
the
possessions
of
the
either
of
the
newspapers
for
examination?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
there
a
request
for
such
an
order?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you
mean
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
who
denied
that
request,
the
district
judge?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
left
that
override
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
on
discovery?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
glendon,
i
recall
an
ancient
doctrine
of
equity
that
about
people
who
come
into
equity
and
certain
burdens
on
them.
doesn't
it
strike
you
rather
extraordinary
that
in
a
case
which
largely
centers
on
protection
of
sources,
the
newspapers
are
making
and
refusing
to
reveal
documents
on
the
grounds
that
they
must
refuse
in
order
to
protect
their
sources?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
issue,
it
say
that
--
it’s
really
--
it’s
in
this
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
the
proceeding
and
there
are
certain
standards
about
people
coming
into
equity,
coming
in
with
clean
hands
as
one
of
them
and
prepared
to
do
equity.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
now
in
the
possession
--
in
the
position
of
making
demands
on
first
amendment
and
you
say
the
newspaper
has
a
right
to
protect
its
sources,
but
the
government
does
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
trial
judge
used
a
clearly
erroneous
standard,
then
the
case
is
not
simply
controlled
by
facts,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
a
trial
judge
in
these
circumstances
used
a
standard
to
judge
the
facts
and
the
standard
was
clearly
erroneous
then
this
is
not
just
a
fact
case,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
he
used
the
wrong
standard
then
it
ceases
to
be
just
a
fact
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
glendon.
