justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
is
the
throughout
the
standard
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor,
your
closed
brief
cover
all
of
the
items
on
a
special
appendix
and
any
that
you
think
should
be
added
to
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
mr.
solicitor
general,
if
we
disagreed
with
you
on
those
that
you
have
covered,
the
remainder
of
the
items
need
to
be
looked
at?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
making
an
argument
that
even
if
those
ten
that
you
have
covered
don’t
move
us
very
far
that
nevertheless
the
cumulative
impact
of
all
the
others
might
tip
the
scale?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree,
no
body
does
it
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that
but
on
those
ten
documents,
i
won’t
press
you
anymore,
you
think
it’s
perhaps
needed
to
be
answered
in
this
case
and
is
perhaps
irrelevant.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor
general,
in
terms
of
equity
on
an
injunction,
however,
to
the
extent
anything
has
been
published
and
has
already
been
revealed,
the
united
states
is
not
seeking
an
injunction
for
--
against
the
further
publication
of
that
particular
item?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor
general
is
the
united
states
pressing
separately
your
request
or
your
cause
of
action
for
the
return
of
the
materials
wholly
aside
from
an
injunction
against
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
thought
that
was
part
of
your
lawsuit
--
part
of
your
request
for
relief
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don’t
understand
that
mr.
solicitor
general.
i
had
thought
the
standard
that
you
were
operating
under
here
in
terms
of
a
prior
restraint
wasn’t
necessarily
equivalent
to
the
standard
that
might
be
operative
in
a
criminal
proceeding
and
whether
or
not
a
newspaper
maybe
enjoined
from
publishing
classified
information
does
necessarily
determine
some
criminal
proceeding.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
standard
concededly
is
not
the
same?
justice
byron
r.
white
professor,
you
stand
--
you
are
contending
for
this
grave
and
immediate
or
not?
is
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
futile
for
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
surely.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you,
i
take
it
then
that
you
could
easily
concede
that
there
maybe
documents
and
these
47
volumes
which
would
satisfy
the
definition
of
top
secret
in
the
executive
order
and
nevertheless
would
not
satisfy
your
standard?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
and
my
question
was
--
let's
concede
for
the
moment
that
there
are
some
documents
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
are
properly
classified
top
secret.
you
would
say
that
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
your
standard
is
satisfied.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it,
i
don’t
have
and
read
anything
in
any
of
your
documents
or
any
of
this
cases
which
the
newspaper
suggest
for
a
moment
that
there
is
no
document
in
these
47
volumes
which
satisfies
the,
properly
the
definition
of
top
secret.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
you
don’t
deny
that,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know
but
--
so
but
your
position
must
be
then
that
even
if
there
is
a
document
or
so,
none
of
them
satisfies
your
standard?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
glendon,
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
if
your
client
had
stolen
these
papers?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
it
wouldn’t
make
any
difference,
the
leak
aspect
has
no
--
it
has
no
relevance
to
the
case
either
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
it
would
be
relevant
if
you
stole
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you’d
be
making
the
same
argument
if
your
client
sent
an
agent
into
the
government
and
stole
these
papers
and
then
the
government
attempted
to
restrain
publication
of
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that
one
is
irrelevant
as
the
other?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
i
think
if
you
do
a
certain
comparison,
not
a
single
document
in
these
47
volumes
which
is
now
entitled
a
top
secret
classification
as
defined
in
the
executive
orders.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
said
he
has
testified
top
secret
standard
or
any
other
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
some
standard
as
they
are
more
specific
by
the
test
to
top
secret
classification?
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
the
standard?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
say
a
proper
standard
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
by
any
doubt?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
any
doubt
that
these
secrets,
i
wonder
what
specified
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
agree
that
judge
gesell
would
find
the
top
secret
definition
he
is
going
to
ask?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
he
thinks?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice

that
