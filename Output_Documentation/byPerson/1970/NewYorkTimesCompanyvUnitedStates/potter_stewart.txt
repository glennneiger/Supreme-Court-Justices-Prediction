justice
potter
stewart
mr.
solicitor
general,
of
course,
as
the
times
film
case
as
well
and
there
are
no
doubt
others.
i
didn’t
understand,
however,
that
your
brother
counsel
on
the
other
side
really
questioned
any
of
this.
i
thought
that
at
least
for
purposes
of
this
case,
they
conceded
that
an
injunction
would
be
not
violative
of
the
first
amendment
or
put
it
this
way
that
despite
the
first
amendment,
an
injunction
would
be
permissible,
in
this
case
if
the
disclosure
of
this
material
would
in
fact
oppose
a
grave
and
immediate
danger
to
the
security
of
united
states,
that
is
that
for
purposes
of
this
case,
they’ve
concede
that,
but
they
have
said
that
in
fact
the
disclosure
of
this
material
would
not
pose
any
such
grave
and
immediate
danger.
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
no
i
am
not
conceding
it
for
them,
but
that
had
been
my
understanding
of
what
the
issue
is.
they'll
make
it
clear
of
course
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
i
have
thought
in
my
analysis
and
i
haven't
had
the
benefit
of
much
more
time
than
you
had,
that
this
basically
came
down
to
a
fact
case
that
the
issues
here
are
factual
issues?
justice
potter
stewart
argue
here
in
this
court,
i
understand.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
the
new
york
times
was
required
too
and
did
give
you
a
list
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
district
of
columbia
proceedings,
of
course,
you
don’t
know,
but
perhaps
the
solicitor
general
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
solicitor,
i
don’t
want
to
bring
in
a
red
herring
in
this
case
or
which
might
be,
but
do
you
also
say
that
the
ten
items
you
have
talked
about
fully
justify
the
classification
that
has
been
given
them
and
it
still
remains
on
them?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand
it
mr.
solicitor
general
and
you
tell
me
please,
if
i
misunderstand
it,
your
case
doesn’t
really
depend
upon
the
classification
of
this
material,
whether
it’s
classified
or
how
it’s
classified.
in
other
words
if
the
new
york
times
and
the
washington
post
had
this
material
as
a
result
of
the
indiscretion
or
irresponsibility
of
an
under
secretary
of
defense
who
took
it
upon
himself
to
declassify
all
of
this
material
and
turn
it
over
and
give
it
to
the
papers,
you
would
still
be
here?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
didn’t
understand
it
was
a
real
string
and
that's
why
i
am
asking
the
question.
justice
potter
stewart
secondly
i
understand
and
tell
me
if
i’m
wrong
again
that
your
case
really
doesn’t
depend
upon
any
assertion
of
property
rights
by
analogy
to
the
copyright
law.
you
are
not
--
your
case
would
be
the
same
if
the
new
york
times
that
acquired
this
information
by
sending
one
of
its
employees
in
to
steal
it
as
it
would
if
it
had
been
presented
to
the
new
york
times
on
a
silver
platter.
justice
potter
stewart
--
rather
than
(voice
overlap)
to
the
government,
am
i
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
your
case
depends
upon
the
claim
as
i
understand
it
that
the
disclosure
of
this
information
would
result
in
an
immediate
grave
threat
to
the
security
of
the
united
states
of
america?
justice
potter
stewart
however,
it
was
acquired
and
however
it’s
classified.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
solicitor
general,
just
before
you
do.
this
brings
me
back
to
my
original
question
a
few
moments
ago
as
to
what
the
real
basic
issue
in
this
case
is.
as
i
understand
it,
you
are
not
claiming
that
you
are
entitled
to
an
injunction
simply
or
solely
because
this
is
classified
material?
justice
potter
stewart
nor
do
i
understand
it
that
you
are
claiming
--
justice
potter
stewart
just
let
me
finish
please,
that
you
are
entitled
to
an
injunction
because
it
was
stolen
from
you,
that
it’s
your
property.
you
are
claiming
rather
and
basically
that
how,
whether
or
not
it’s
classified
or
however
it’s
classified
and
however
it
was
acquired
by
these
newspapers,
the
disclosure,
the
public
disclosure
of
this
material
would
pose
a
grave
and
immediate
danger
to
the
security
of
the
united
states
of
america.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
isn’t
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
declassifications
vel
non
doesn’t
have
much
to
do
with
the
basic
issue,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
now
it
would
be
in
the
public
domain
already?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
very
saggy
case
on
the
facts
and
that’s
--[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
therefore
is
a
fact
case,
isn’t
it?
until
we
can
decide
this
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
we
have
to
look
at
the
facts,
the
evidence
in
this
case
that’s
been
submitted
under
scrutiny
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
may
have
a
great
deal
to
do
as
to
whether
--
as
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
somebody
is
guilty
of
a
criminal
offense,
but
i
submit
it
has
very
little
to
do
with
the
basic
first
amendment
issue
before
this
court
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
first
ground?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
based
upon
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
power
of
the
executive
and
the
area
of
international
relationships
and
in
the
area
of
the
defense
of
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
justice
potter
stewart
and
your
standard
is
that
it
has
to
be
an
extremely
grave
event
to
the
nation
and
it
has
to
be
directly,
approximately
caused
by
the
publication?
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
gather
then
that
your
basic
argument
with
the
statutory
or
the
regulatory
definition
of
top
secret
is
with
the
word
“could”
because
that
definition
says
unauthorized
disclosure
which
could
result
in
blah,
blah,
blah?
justice
potter
stewart
you
would
insist
that
it
would
probably
result
--
justice
potter
stewart
now
mr.
bickel
it’s
understandably
and
inevitably
true
that
in
a
case
like
this,
particularly
when
so
many
of
the
facts
are
under
seal,
it’s
necessary
to
speak
in
abstract
terms?
justice
potter
stewart
but
let
me
give
you
a
hypothetical
case.
let
us
assume
that
when
the
members
of
the
court
go
back
and
open
up
this
sealed
record,
we
find
something
there
that
absolutely
convinces
us
that
its
disclosure
would
result
in
the
sentencing
to
death
of
a
hundred
young
men
whose
only
offense
had
been
that
they
were
19
years
old
and
had
low
draft
numbers,
what
should
we
do?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there
isn’t,
we
agree
or
you
submit,
so
i’m
asking
in
this
case
what
should
we
do?
justice
potter
stewart
as
you
know,
as
i’m
sure
you
do
know,
the
concern
that
this
court
now
has
term
after
term
with
people
who
have
been
convicted
and
sentenced
to
death,
convicted
of
extremely
serious
crimes,
you
know,
that
the
capital
cases
and
i’m
posing
you
a
case
where
the
disclosure
of
something
in
these
files
would
result
in
the
death
of
people
who
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
or
nothing.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
in
a
great
big
global
picture,
this
is
no
--
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
not
a
national
threat.
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
at
least
25
americans
killed
in
vietnam
every
week
these
days.
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
what
i’m
assuming
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
my
hypothetical
case.
justice
potter
stewart
you
would
say
the
constitution
requires
that
it
be
published
and
that
this
men
die,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
nature
question.
justice
potter
stewart
before
you
proceed
mr.
gendon
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
you
agree
that
that
is
the
proper
test?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
would
you
repeat
the
words,
so
that
i’ll
have
them
in
mind?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
would
not
cover
the
simple
death,
say
of
a
hundred
or
200
young
men?
justice
potter
stewart
well
we
have
a
lot
of
things
under
seal
that
i
don’t
want
to
have
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
i’ve
seen
some
off
but
haven’t
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
were
brought
in?
justice
potter
stewart
this
then
really
is,
the
issues
in
this
case
really
are
factual
issues,
aren’t
they?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean,
though
i
understand
it
and
this
is
--
that’s
my
understanding
initially,
i
haven’t
heard
anything
really
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
upon
my
understanding,
you
agree
that
an
injunction
could
issue
despite
the
first
amendment
if
it
were
shown,
proved
by
the
government
that
there
was
something
here,
disclosure
of
which
would
directly
cause
a
great
irreparable
and
immediate
danger
to
the
country,
you
agree
that
an
injunction
could
issue.
you
just
simply
say
they
have
shown
nothing
of
the
kind,
isn’t
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that’s
a
matter
of
fact?
justice
potter
stewart
scope
of
review
of
what?
justice
potter
stewart
of
fact,
of
findings
of
fact
under
rule
52
a,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it's
factual
issue.
justice
potter
stewart
they
did
simply
the
matter
of
review,
did
they?
they
considered
the
matter
of
--
of
original
findings.
justice
potter
stewart
they
were
reviewing
any
classification?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
de
novo
hearing
on
whether
or
not
the
publication
would
show.
justice
potter
stewart
it
wasn’t
reviewing
any
classification
by
the
executive
department,
was
it?
they
didn’t
consider
that
that’s
what
they
were
doing.
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
basically
irrelevant,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
haven’t
heard
the
solicitor
general
say
that
here
today
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
i
asked
him
a
question,
he
said
there
were
those
in
the
government
who
like
to
make
that
argument,
but
he
was
not
pressing
it.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
it
hasn’t,
the
government
has
not
in
this
court
made
the
argument
that
simply
because
it’s
top
secret,
they
are
entitled
to
an
injunction,
they
made
that
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
i’m
not
sure
i
understand
what
you
said.
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
the
assumption
that
the
district
judge
would
examine
the
evidence
and
that
the
district
judge
refused
to
do
so
--
justice
potter
stewart
now,
which
case
we’re
talking
about
now?
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understood
it,
there
was
no
claim
that
judge
gurfein
didn’t
consider
everything
that
was
then
before
him
that
the
new
matter
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
justice
potter
stewart
oh!
i
know
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
he
said
he
did
not,
he
didn’t
refuse
to,
he
failed
to.
justice
potter
stewart
he
said
he
didn’t
have
time
to,
but
he
did
ask
the
government
to
--
please
bring
forward
the
worst
and
that’s
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
new
matter
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals.
justice
potter
stewart
probably
the
reason
is,
of
course
as
you
know
mr.
solicitor
general
that
unless
the
constitutional
laws
that
now
exists
is
changed,
a
prior
restraint
or
publication
by
a
newspaper
is
presumably
unconstitutional?
justice
potter
stewart
well
then
--
and
your
brother
counsel
on
the
other
side
don’t
disagree
with
you
mr.
solicitor
general.
they
don’t
take
mr.
justice
black’s
position,
at
least
for
purposes
of
argument
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
glendon
said
that
he
thought
judge
gazelle's
standard
was
the
correct
one.
mr.
bickel
said
that
he
was
not
in
no
claim
that
the
--
that
there’s
an
absolute
prohibition
of
the
prior
restraint?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
solicitor
general,
of
course,
as
the
times
film
case
as
well
and
there
are
no
doubt
others.
i
didn’t
understand,
however,
that
your
brother
counsel
on
the
other
side
really
questioned
any
of
this.
i
thought
that
at
least
for
purposes
of
this
case,
they
conceded
that
an
injunction
would
be
not
violative
of
the
first
amendment
or
put
it
this
way
that
despite
the
first
amendment,
an
injunction
would
be
permissible,
in
this
case
if
the
disclosure
of
this
material
would
in
fact
oppose
a
grave
and
immediate
danger
to
the
security
of
united
states,
that
is
that
for
purposes
of
this
case,
they’ve
concede
that,
but
they
have
said
that
in
fact
the
disclosure
of
this
material
would
not
pose
any
such
grave
and
immediate
danger.
(voice

justice
potter

no
i
am
not
conceding
it
for
them,

had

an
injunction
because
it
was
stolen
from
you,
that
it’s
your
property.
you
are
claiming
rather
and
basically
that
how,
whether
or
not
it’s
classified
or
however
it’s
classified
and
however
it
was
acquired
by
these
newspapers,
the
disclosure,
the
public
disclosure
of
this
material
would
pose
a
grave
and
immediate
danger
to
the
security
of
the
united
states
of
america.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
isn’t
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
declassifications
vel
non
doesn’t
have
much
to
do
with
the
basic
issue,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
now
it
would
be
in
the
public
domain
already?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
very
saggy
case
on
the
facts
and
that’s
--[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
therefore
is
a
fact
case,
isn’t
it?
until
we
can
decide
this
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
we
have
to
look
at
the
facts,
the
evidence
in
this
case
that’s
been
submitted
under
scrutiny
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
may
have
a
great
deal
to
do
as
to
whether
--
as
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
somebody
is
guilty
of
a
criminal
offense,
but
i
submit
it
has
very
little
to
do
with
the
basic
first
amendment
issue
before
this
court
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
first
ground?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
based
upon
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
power
of
the
executive
and
the
area
of
international
relationships
and
in
the
area
of
the
defense
of
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
justice
potter
stewart
and
your
standard
is
that
it
has
to
be
an
extremely
grave
event
to
the
nation
and
it
has
to
be
directly,
approximately
caused
by
the
publication?
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
gather
then
that
your
basic
argument
with
the
statutory
or
the
regulatory
definition
of
top
secret
is
with
the
word
“could”
because
that
definition
says
unauthorized
disclosure
which
could
result
in
blah,
blah,
blah?
justice
potter
stewart
you
would
insist
that
it
would
probably
result
--
justice
potter
stewart
now
mr.
bickel
it’s
understandably
and
inevitably
true
that
in
a
case
like
this,
particularly
when
so
many
of
the
facts
are
under
seal,
it’s
necessary
to
speak
in
abstract
terms?
justice
potter
stewart
but
let
me
give
you
a
hypothetical
case.
let
us
assume
that
when
the
members
of
the
court
go
back
and
open
up
this
sealed
record,
we
find
something
there
that
absolutely
convinces
us
that
its
disclosure
would
result
in
the
sentencing
to
death
of
a
hundred
young
men
whose
only
offense
had
been
that
they
were
19
years
old
and
had
low
draft
numbers,
what
should
we
do?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there
isn’t,
we
agree
or
you
submit,
so
i’m
asking
in
this
case
what
should
we
do?
justice
potter
stewart
as
you
know,
as
i’m
sure
you
do
know,
the
concern
that
this
court
now
has
term
after
term
with
people
who
have
been
convicted
and
sentenced
to
death,
convicted
of
extremely
serious
crimes,
you
know,
that
the
capital
cases
and
i’m
posing
you
a
case
where
the
disclosure
of
something
in
these
files
would
result
in
the
death
of
people
who
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
or
nothing.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
in
a
great
big
global
picture,
this
is
no
--
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
not
a
national
threat.
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
at
least
25
americans
killed
in
vietnam
every
week
these
days.
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
what
i’m
assuming
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
my
hypothetical
case.
justice
potter
stewart
you
would
say
the
constitution
requires
that
it
be
published
and
that
this
men
die,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
nature
question.
justice
potter
stewart
before
you
proceed
mr.
gendon
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
you
agree
that
that
is
the
proper
test?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
would
you
repeat
the
words,
so
that
i’ll
have
them
in
mind?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
would
not
cover
the
simple
death,
say
of
a
hundred
or
200
young
men?
justice
potter
stewart
well
we
have
a
lot
of
things
under
seal
that
i
don’t
want
to
have
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
i’ve
seen
some
off
but
haven’t
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
were
brought
in?
justice
potter
stewart
this
then
really
is,
the
issues
in
this
case
really
are
factual
issues,
aren’t
they?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean,
though
i
understand
it
and
this
is
--
that’s
my
understanding
initially,
i
haven’t
heard
anything
really
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
upon
my
understanding,
you
agree
that
an
injunction
could
issue
despite
the
first
amendment
if
it
were
shown,
proved
by
the
government
that
there
was
something
here,
disclosure
of
which
would
directly
cause
a
great
irreparable
and
immediate
danger
to
the
country,
you
agree
that
an
injunction
could
issue.
you
just
simply
say
they
have
shown
nothing
of
the
kind,
isn’t
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that’s
a
matter
of
fact?
justice
potter
stewart
scope
of
review
of
what?
justice
potter
stewart
of
fact,
of
findings
of
fact
under
rule
52
a,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it's
factual
issue.
justice
potter
stewart
they
did
simply
the
matter
of
review,
did
they?
they
considered
the
matter
of
--
of
original
findings.
justice
potter
stewart
they
were
reviewing
any
classification?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
de
novo
hearing
on
whether
or
not
the
publication
would
show.
justice
potter
stewart
it
wasn’t
reviewing
any
classification
by
the
executive
department,
was
it?
they
didn’t
consider
that
that’s
what
they
were
doing.
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
basically
irrelevant,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
haven’t
heard
the
solicitor
general
say
that
here
today
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
i
asked
him
a
question,
he
said
there
were
those
in
the
government
who
like
to
make
that
argument,
but
he
was
not
pressing
it.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
it
hasn’t,
the
government
has
not
in
this
court
made
the
argument
that
simply
because
it’s
top
secret,
they
are
entitled
to
an
injunction,
they
made
that
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
i’m
not
sure
i
understand
what
you
said.
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
the
assumption
that
the
district
judge
would
examine
the
evidence
and
that
the
district
judge
refused
to
do
so
--
justice
potter
stewart
now,
which
case
we’re
talking
about
now?
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understood
it,
there
was
no
claim
that
judge
gurfein
didn’t
consider
everything
that
was
then
before
him
that
the
new
matter
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
justice
potter
stewart
oh!
i
know
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
he
said
he
did
not,
he
didn’t
refuse
to,
he
failed
to.
justice
potter
stewart
he
said
he
didn’t
have
time
to,
but
he
did
ask
the
government
to
--
please
bring
forward
the
worst
and
that’s
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
new
matter
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals.
justice
potter
stewart
probably
the
reason
is,
of
course
as
you
know
mr.
solicitor
general
that
unless
the
constitutional
laws
that
now
exists
is
changed,
a
prior
restraint
or
publication
by
a
newspaper
is
presumably
unconstitutional?
justice
potter
stewart
well
then
--
and
your
brother
counsel
on
the
other
side
don’t
disagree
with
you
mr.
solicitor
general.
they
don’t
take
mr.
justice
black’s
position,
at
least
for
purposes
of
argument
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
glendon
said
that
he
thought
judge
gazelle's
standard
was
the
correct
one.
mr.
bickel
said
that
he
was
not
in
no
claim
that
the
--
that
there’s
an
absolute
prohibition
of
the
prior
restraint?
