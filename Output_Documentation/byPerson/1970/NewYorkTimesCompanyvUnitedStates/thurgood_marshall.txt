mr.

on
this
45-day
study,
does
that
depend
on
how
we
rule
in
this
case
or
is
the
government
going
to
do
it
anyhow?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
the
court
decides
the
other
way,
will
the
study
be
made?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
this
mean
(inaudible)
without
this
case
that
the
court,
that
the
government
has
the
right
to
find
out
what’s
available
to
be
published.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
if
the
--
this
court
would
by
chance
rule
against
you,
then
the
government
will
surely
do
it,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
it
is
because
if
the
government
will
leak
47
volumes
at
the
time
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
basis
did
it
have
on
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
solicitor
general,
what
particularly
words
made
at
this
point,
as
i
assume
that
there
are
not
studies
now
are
being
made,
in
the
future
there
will
be
study
made
about
combodio,
louse
(ph)
you
name
it
and
if
you
prevail
in
this
case,
then
in
any
incidents
that
anybody
comes
about
any
of
those
studies,
a
temporary
restraining
order
will
automatically
issued,
am
i
correct?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
wouldn't
we
then
be,
the
federal
courts
be
the
censorship
board
as
to
rather
this
judge
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
what
i
thought
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
a
first
amendment
violation.[laughter]
