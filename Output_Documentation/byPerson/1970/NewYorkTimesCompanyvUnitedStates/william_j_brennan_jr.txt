justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
mr.
solicitor
general?
am
i
correct
that
the
injunction
so
far
granted
against
the
times
and
the
post
haven’t
stopped
other
newspapers
from
publishing
materials
based
on
this
study
or
kindled
papers?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then,
are
you
suggesting
that
these
other
newspapers
do
not
in
fact
have
either
this
study
or
access
to
this
study
or
parts
of
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you’re
not
telling
us
that
they
don’t?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
is
the
possibility
that
they
do
of
either
the
study
the
same
thing
the
post
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
if
that
were
the
fact,
am
i
wrong,
i’ve
always
thought
that
the
rule
was
that
the
equity
has
to
be
rather
careful
not
to
issue
ineffective
injunctions
and
isn’t
that
a
rule
or
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
fact
to
be
considered
in
these
cases?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
gather
you
do
agree
that
the
ordinary
equitable
principle
is
not
to
issue
useless
injunctions,
isn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
would
that
mean
mr.
solicitor
general
that
if
the
government
were
to
prevail
here
and
that
sometime,
some
document
within
the
scope
of
the
injunction
that
the
government
got
was
published
in
some
other
newspaper
that
then
either
the
times
and
the
post
could
run
in
and
get
to
that
extent
the
injunction
nullify?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that’s
the
only
thing
they
could
do,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
is
the
government
pressing?
is
the
government
trying
to
get
these
materials
back
from
the
times
and
the
post?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
wasn’t
my
question,
my
question
is,
is
the
government
attempting?
