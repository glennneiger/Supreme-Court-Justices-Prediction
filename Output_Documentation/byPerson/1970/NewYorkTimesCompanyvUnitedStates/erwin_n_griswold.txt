mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
say
in
respect
of
the
announcement
just
made
that
all
three
parties
have
filed
a
closed
brief
as
well
as
the
open
brief
and
in
addition,
i
have
filed
just
within
minutes,
two
statements,
one
prepared
by
the
state
department
and
one
prepared
by
the
department
of
defense,
giving
more
detail
about
some
of
the
items
which
are
discussed
in
my
closed
brief
and
i
believe
that
those
will
all
be
before
the
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
only
ones
that
are
security
matters
that
i
have
filed
are
all
marked
top
secret.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
items
filed
by
the
post
and
the
times,
i
do
not
believe
are
marked
top
secret,
but
they
are
marked
in-camera
in
the
caption
of
the
items.
i
repeat,
all
three
have
also
filed
regular
briefs
except
not
printed,
only
the
american
civil
liberties
union
seem
to
have
the
resources
to
produce
a
printed
brief
for
this
case.
i
am
told
that
the
law
students
of
today
are
indignantly
opposed
to
final
examinations
because
they
say
that
no
lawyer
has
asked
to
work
under
such
pressure
that
he
as
to
get
things
out
in
three
or
four
hours.
i
can
only
say
that
i
think
it’s
perhaps
fortunate
that
mr.
glendon
and
mr.
bickel
and
i
went
to
law
school
under
earlier
dispensation.
it
is
important
i
think
to
get
this
case
in
perspective.
the
case
of
course
raises
important
and
difficult
problems
about
the
constitutional
right
of
free
speech
and
of
the
free
press
and
we’ve
heard
much
about
that
from
the
press
in
the
last
two
weeks.
but
it
also
raises
important
questions
of
the
equally
fundamental
and
important
right
of
the
government
to
function.
great
emphasis
has
been
put
on
the
first
amendment
and
rightly
so.
but
there
is
also
involved
here
a
fundamental
question
of
separation
of
powers
in
the
sense
of
the
power
and
authority
which
the
constitution
allocates
to
the
president
as
chief
executive
and
as
commander-in-chief
of
the
army
and
navy
and
involved
in
that,
there
is
also
the
question
of
the
integrity
of
the
institution
of
the
presidency
whether
that
institution,
one
of
the
three
great
powers
under
the
separation
of
powers,
can
function
effectively.
the
problem
lies
on
a
wide
spectrum
and
like
all
questions
of
constitutional
law,
involves
the
resolution
of
competing
principles.
in
the
first
place
it
seems
to
me
that
it
will
be
helpful
to
make
some
preliminary
observations.
if
we
start
out
with
the
assumption
that
never
under
any
circumstances
can
the
press
be
subjected
to
prior
restraints,
never
under
any
circumstances
can
the
press
be
enjoined
from
publications,
of
course,
we
come
out
with
the
conclusion
that
there
can
be
no
injunction
here.
but
i
suggest,
not
as
necessarily
conclusive
in
this
case,
but
i
suggest
that
there
is
no
such
constitutional
rule
and
never
has
been
such
a
constitutional
rule.
we
have
for
example
the
copyright
laws
and
my
son
was
in
trial
earlier
this
week
and
he
sent
me
copies
of
the
globe
&
mail
of
toronto,
ten
series
of
the
story
that
pentagon
is
trying
to
kill,
each
one
added
copyright
new
york
times
service.
i
have
no
objection
to
that,
but
i
--
these
stories
which
had
then
published
have
been
copyrighted
by
the
new
york
times
and
i
believe
by
the
portion
imposed
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
perhaps
in
other
cases
because
these
have
already
attracted
much
attention,
the
new
york
times
and
the
washington
post
would
seek
to
enforce
their
copyright.
i
suppose
it
is
very
likely
that
in
one
form
or
another,
they
have
obtained
royalties
because
of
their
copyright
on
this
matter,
but
let
us
also
consider
other
fields
of
the
law.
there
is
a
well
known
branch
of
the
law
that
goes
under
the
heading
of
“literary
property.”
in
the
court
of
appeals,
i
gave
the
example
of
a
manuscript
written
by
earnest
hemingway,
let’s
assume
while
he
is
still
living,
unpublished,
perhaps
incomplete,
subject
to
revision.
in
some
way
the
press
gets
hold
of
it.
perhaps
it’s
stolen,
perhaps
it’s
bought
from
a
secretary
through
breech
of
fiduciary
responsibility
or
perhaps
it’s
filed
on
the
segue
and
if
the
new
york
times
sought
to
print
that,
i
have
no
doubt
that
mr.
hemingway
or
now
his
heirs
next
to
kin,
could
obtain
from
the
courts
an
injunction
against
the
press
printing.
only
this
morning,
i
see
in
the
paper
that
a
new
york
publisher
is
bringing
a
suit
against
newsday,
a
new
york
news
paper
because
newsday
has
violated
what
the
new
york
publisher
consists
says
considers
to
be
it’s
copyright
in
the
forthcoming
memoirs
of
president
johnson.
and
then
finally
or
not
finally,
but
next,
we
have
a
whole
series
of
law,
a
traditional
branch
of
equity,
involving
participation
and
the
breech
of
trust
and
there
cannot
be
the
slightest
doubt,
it
seems
to
me,
that
no
matter
what
the
motive,
no
matter
what
the
justification
that
both
the
new
york
times
and
the
washington
post
are
here
consciously,
intentionally
participating
in
a
breech
of
trust.
they
know
that
this
material
is
not
theirs,
they
do
not
own
it.
i’m
not
talking
about
the
pieces
of
paper
of
which
they
may
have
acquired
by
the
literary
property
and
again
i
say
i
don’t
regard
this
as
controlling
or
conclusive
in
this
case.
i’m
simply
trying
to
advance
the
proposition
that
there
are
many
factors
and
many
facets
here
and
that
there
is
no
constitutional
rule
that
there
can
never
be
prior
restraints
on
the
press
or
on
free
speech.
now
in
our
main
brief
in
this
case,
we
have
which
i
may
say
was
largely
prepared
by
my
associate
mr.
friedman,
last
evening
and
last
night.
we
have
cited
one
case
which
comes
very
close
to
being
a
injunction
by
this
court
against
publications
in
the
press
and
that
is
the
associated
press
case
in
i
believe
215
united
states.
the
associated
press
is
a
cooperative
of
newspapers
and
there,
the
associated
press
sought
and
obtained
an
injunction
against
the
dissemination
of
news
by
its
competitor
united
or
international
press
in
that
case
not
united
by
its
competitor
international
and
that
was
granted
on
copyright
and
related
grounds.
but
we
have
other
areas
in
the
law
where
this
court
has
approved
against
specific
first
amendment
claims,
injunctions
in
advance
forbidding
speech.
one
area
of
this
is
the
labor
law
field
where
as
recently
is
395
u.s.
in
sinclair
against
the
national
labor
relations
board,
the
court
unanimously
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
enforcing
the
board's
order
which
included
a
provision
requiring
sinclair
to
cease
and
desist
from
the
threatening
the
employees
with
the
possible
closing
of
the
plant
or
the
transfer
of
the
weaving
production
with
the
attendant
loss
of
employment
or
with
any
other
economic
reprisals,
if
they
were
to
select
the
above
named
or
any
other
labor
organization.
in
393
u.s,
a
case
involving
the
federal
trade
commission,
federal
trade
commission
against
the
tex
--
against
texaco
inc.,
involving
orders
with
respect
to
tba,
tires,
battery
and
accessories,
the
court
approved
the
order
of
the
federal
trade
commission
which
restrained
texaco
from
using
or
attempting
to
use
any
device
such
as,
but
not
limited
to,
dealer
discussions,
they
were
ordered
not
to
speak
to
dealers
about
this
subject
and
the
first
amendment
was
specifically
referred
to
in
the
brief
for
the
respondent
and
was
not
mentioned
in
this
court’s
opinion.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice
if
they
have
conceded
it,
i
am
glad
to
proceed
on
that
basis.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
may
say
that
their
brief
were
served
on
me
within
the
last
15
minutes
which
--
the
last
hour
which
was
entirely
in
accordance
with
this
court’s
order,
but
i
have
not
seen
their
briefs.
i
do
not
know
what
is
in
their
briefs.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
that
mr.
justice
is
extremely
difficult
to
discuss
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--in
open
court
and
we
have
endeavored
to
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice
white,
it
was
the
latter
point
for
which
i
was
seeking
to
get
this
because
our
contention,
particularly
with
respect
to
the
washington
post
case
is
that
the
wrong
standard
has
been
used.
now
with
respect
to
the
actual
factual
situations,
the
only
thing
that
i
can
do
is
to
point
to
the
closed
brief,
which
i
have
filed
in
which
there
are
ten
specific
items
referred
to.
now
when
i
say
specific
items,
i
must
be
--
i
must
make
myself
very
clear.
some
of
those
are
collective.
there
are
--
i
have
brought
here,
you
perhaps
can’t
see
them,
the
47
volumes
that
are
supposed
to
be
the
background
of
this,
they
are
included
in
the
record
of
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
has
been
filed
with
the
court.
let
me
say
when
we
move
on
to
this
next
item
that
it
was
inevitable
that
i
delegate
the
question
of
preparing
the
supplemental
statement
which
was
covered
by
this
court’s
order
yesterday.
this
court,
as
did
the
second
circuit,
referred
to
the
material
specified
in
the
special
appendix
in
the
second
circuit
and
to
such
additional
items
as
might
be
included
on
a
supplemental
statement
filed
at
5:00
pm
yesterday.
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
preparing
that
supplemental
statement.
i
have
able
and
conscientious
associates
who
did
work
on
it.
however,
when
i
had
a
chance
to
see
it
last
evening,
particularly
after
the
state
department
called
me
at
8:00
or
9:00
at
night
and
said
they
had
four
additional
items,
and
i
said
that
the
court’s
deadline
was
5:00
pm
and
that
i
could
not
add
any
additional
items.
i
then
examined
it.
here
is
a
copy
and
i
find
it
much
too
broad.
in
particular,
it
has
at
the
end
a
statement,
in
view
of
the
uncertainties
as
to
the
précised
documents
in
defendant’s
custody
and
i
say
that
is
a
--
has
been
an
extreme
difficulty
in
this
matter.
we
don’t
know
now,
never
have
know
what
the
papers
have.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
prepared
an
inventory
but
from
it,
it
is
not
possible
to
tell
whether
they
are
the
same
papers
that
we
have.
part
of
the
problem
here
is
that
a
great
mass
of
this
material
is
not
included
in
the
47
volumes.
it
is
a
background
material,
earlier
drafts
of
some
papers
which
are
materially
different
than
what
is
included
in
the
47
volumes
and
as
a
result,
we
cannot
tell
from
the
inventory
what
is
included.
for
example,
one
of
the
items
already
published
which
has
caused
a
certain
amount
of
controversy,
publicly
and
internationally,
is
a
telegram
to
the
canadian
government,
that
is
not
in
the
47
volumes
and
is
not
referred
to
in
the
47
volumes.
where
they
got
it,
how
they
got
it,
what
it
is,
i
do
not
know.
but
in
this
supplemental
memorandum,
it
is
stated
under
my
signature
that
the
petitioner
specifies
an
addition
to
the
foregoing
any
information
relating
to
the
following
and
then
there
are
listed
13
items
and
frankly
i
regard
that
as
much
too
broad.
and
therefore,
i
am
saying
here
that
we
rely
with
respect
to
this
factual
question
only
on
the
items
specified
in
the
supplemental
appendix,
filed
in
the
second
circuit
and
on
such
additional
items
as
are
covered
in
my
closed
brief
in
this
case.
those
additional
items
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice,
it
does
not
refer
to
all
of
them.
what
i
tried
to
do
in
my
closed
brief
was
i
spent
all
yesterday
afternoon
in
constant
successive
conversation
with
the
individuals
from
the
state
department,
the
defense
department,
the
national
security
agency
and
i
said
“look,
tell
me
what
are
the
words,
tell
me
what
are
the
things
that
really
make
trouble.”
and
they
told
me
and
i
made
long-hand
notes
of
what
they
told
me
and
from
that
i
prepared
the
closed
brief.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
think
that
the
odds
are
strong
that
that
is
an
accurate
statement.
i
must
say
that
i
have
not
examined
everyone
of
the
items.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
that
there
ought
to
be
an
opportunity
for
a
full
and
free
judicial
consideration
of
each
of
the
items
covered
in
the
supplemental
appendix.
now,
it's
perfectly
true
that
there
was
a
trial
before
judge
gesell
in
the
district
court
of
the
united
states.
i
referred
to
it
in
my
closed
brief
as
hastily
conducted
and
i
have
said
that
i
--
there
was
no
trace
of
criticism
in
that.
judge
gesell
started
the
trial
at
8:00
last
monday
morning
and
was
under
order
from
the
court
of
appeals
to
have
a
decision
made
by
5:00
pm
and
there
are
47
volumes
of
material
and
millions
of
words
and
there
are
people
in
various
agency
to
the
government
who
have
to
be
consulted
and
mr.
glendon
quite
appropriately
conducted
cross
examination
which
took
time
and
much
of
the
material
had
to
be
presented
by
affidavits
and
there
simply
has
not
been
a
full
careful
consideration
of
this
material.
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
based
on
what
was
told
to
me
yesterday
afternoon
by
the
concerned
persons,
the
ten
items
in
my
supplemental
--
in
my
closed
brief
are
the
ones
on
which
we
most
rely
but
i
have
not
seen
a
great
many
of
the
other
items
in
the
special
appendix
simply
for
sheer
lack
of
time.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
trial
in
the
district
of
columbia
occurred
between
8:00
am
and
5:00
pm,
including
the
decision
last
monday.
i
participated
in
the
oral
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
it
occupied
two
hours
and
a
half,
two
hours
and
forty-five
minutes.
started
at
about
2:15
and
was
over
i
think
just
before
5:00
that
is
the
entire
amount
of
judicial
time
which
has
been
devoted
to
million
of
words.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i’m
not
sure
whether
this
case
turns
on
classification.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
judicial
proceeding
has
been
brought
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
by
either
newspaper.
there
is
provision
there
for
citing
a
proceeding
in
court
in
case
materials
are
wrongly
determined.
no
judicial
determination
has
been
made
that
any
classification
was
arbitrary
or
capricious.
there
is
a
complication
here
which
people
who
lived
with
this
become
familiar
with,
which
is
that
is
any
compilation
takes
the
classification
of
the
highest
classified
item.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
it
need
not
be
answered,
but
my
position
would
be
that
as
to
those
10
items,
it’s
more
than
10
documents
as
to
those
10
items
that
they
are
properly
classified
top
secret.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
one
of
the
items,
i
should
make
plain
is
four
volumes
of
the
47
volumes,
four
related
volumes,
all
dealing
with
one
specific
subject.
the
broaching
of
which
to
the
entire
world
at
this
time
would
be
of
extraordinary
seriousness
to
the
security
of
the
united
states
and
as
i
say
that
is
covered
in
my
closed
brief
and
i’m
not
free
to
say
more
about
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
would
still
be
here,
but
would
have
one
string
off
my
book.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
it
maybe
this,
but
there
are
those
who
think
it
is
and
i
must
be
careful
not
to
concede
away
in
this
court
grounds
with
some
responsible
officers
of
the
government,
i
think
how
important,
but
i
do
understand
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice
but
i
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
i
don’t
--
i
don’t
think
that
literary
property
is
wholly
irrelevant
here,
but
my
case
does
not
depend
upon
it.
and
i
say
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice
but
i
think
that
the
fact
that
it
was
obviously
acquired
improperly
is
not
irrelevant
in
the
consideration
of
that
question
and
i
repeat
obviously
acquired
improperly.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
my
understanding
mr.
justice,
though
i
have
not
had
an
opportunity
to
read
everything
that
has
been
published
in
other
newspapers.
it
is
my
understanding
that
except
with
respect
to
the
items
in
the
new
york
times,
the
washington
post
and
the
boston
globe,
there
has
not
been
published
anything
else
which
is
not
covered
by
material
already
published
either
in
this
series
or
elsewhere.
it
would
appear
to
us
that
other
papers
have
sought
to
get
into
the
act
and
they
have
assigned
their
writers
to
write
what
you
can,
but
we
have
not
been
able
to
find
new
disclosures
of
previously
unpublished
material
in
these
other
articles.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
do
not
know.
i
have
no
information
whatever.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no.
the
only
information
that
i
have
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
is
a
possibility
that
anybody
has
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
i
appreciate
that.
i
am
trying
to
say
that
on
the
basis
of
the
information
now
known,
this
is
not
that
situation.
i
repeat,
i
have
not
read
these
other
articles,
i
am
advised
by
people
who
have
that
they
do
not
contain
a
new
disclosures
that
they
are
--
it’s
now
becoming
fashionable
and
popular,
you
are
not
a
good
newspaper
unless
you
got
some
of
this
stuff
and
that
they
had
put
out
articles
with
all
kinds
window
dressing,
probably
very
well
written,
but
not
containing
new
disclosures.
i
am
not
able
to
testify
to
that
and
i
can’t
point
to
anything
in
the
record
which
supports
that.
certainly
we
are
concerned
about
the
problem
of
the
effectiveness
of
any
order
which
might
be
issued
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
not
to
issue
useless
injunction
and
it
is
our
position
that
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
or
known
outside
the
record
which
would
indicate
that
this
injunction
would
be
useless.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
we
don’t
know
what
they
have
or
how
they
got
it
nor
do
--
that
matter
is
equally
true
with
the
new
york
times
and
the
washington
post.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
denied
that
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don’t
know.
i
don’t
believe
that
has
been
an
issue
in
the
washington
post
case
or
was
anything
like
that
in
the
--
mr.
seymour
advises
me
there
was
nothing
like
that
in
the
new
york
times
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
i
think
that
at
that
point,
we
would
agree
that
it
becomes
futile,
it
is
a
useless
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
would
think
so
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
would
think
so
yes.
i
may
say
that
it
was
--
both
--
stated
in
both
lower
courts
in
new
york
by
mr.
seymour
and
here
by
me
that
the
president
last
january
directed
a
complete
review
of
classification
of
all
materials.
several
secretaries
of
state
defense
and
the
chairman
of
the
joint
chiefs
of
staff
authorized
us
then
to
say
that
they
are
prepared
to
appoint
immediately
a
joint
task
force
to
conduct
an
exhaustive
declassification
study
of
the
47
volumes.
that
they
will
conduct
a
study
on
an
expedited
basis
and
will
complete
it
within
any
reasonable
time
that
the
court
may
choose.
they
suggest
a
minimum
of
45
days
and
upon
completion
of
the
study,
the
government
will
withdraw
its
objection
for
the
publication
of
any
documents
which
it
is
found
no
longer
relevant
to
the
national
security.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
not
involved
in
this
case,
in
this
court
at
this
time.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
can
certainly
say
the
government
would
like
to
get
them
back.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
government
is
not
at
this
time
seeking
an
order
for
their
return.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
believe
it
was,
but
we
did
not
appeal
with
respect
to
that
nor
is
it
covered
in
our
petition
for
certiorari.
is
that
not
right?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
will
urge
the
government
to
do
it
anyhow.
of
course,
if
this
court
does
not
allow
any
injunction,
it
will
be
feudal
because
the
material
will
be
published
and
there
won’t
be
any
particular
–
entirely
postmortem
to
say
“well
it
was
alright
anyhow.”
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
study
is
going
to
be
made.
i
will
do
my
best
to
see
that
the
study
is
made
and
i
believe
i
have
the
full
support
of
the
entire
administration
with
respect
to
that.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i’m
sorry
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
(voice
overlap)yes,
mr.
justice
except
that
it’s
a
massive
operation.
there
isn't
a
slightest
doubt
in
my
mind
that
there
has
been,
as
long
as
i
can
remember
which
is
quite
awhile,
a
massive
over
classification
of
material
and
there
has
been
much
too
slow
review
to
provide
declassification
and
the
government
is
in
the
process
of
taking
steps
to
try
to
find
a
way
to
work
that
problem
out.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
the
court
should
rule
against
us
here,
then
i
--
then
it
seems
to
me
that
it
becomes
moot
with
respect
to
these
items,
they
can
be
published
and
whether
we
classify
them
or
declassify
them
as
an
academic
question.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
court
will
in
effect
have
declassified
the
materials.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
you
are
certainly
right
mr.
justice.
if
i
may
say
so
in
terms
of
an
examination
question,
i
find
it
exceedingly
difficult
to
think
that
any
jury
would
convict
or
as
an
appellate
court
would
affirm
a
conviction
of
a
criminal
offense
for
the
publication
of
materials
which
this
court
had
said
could
be
published
as
simply
is
the
practical
matter
whether
it
was
a
crime
or
not.
well,
these
are
the
same
materials
that
were
involved
in
the
new
york
times
case.
all
we
did
was
publish
them
and
i
find
it
difficult
to
think
that
such
case
should
be
prosecuted
or
could
if
they
(inaudible)
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it’s
not
the
same
issue
and
i
repeat,
i
think
it
would
be
technically
be
a
crime
if
the
materials
remain
classified.
now
i
would
like
to
get
on
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
nor
because
we
own
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
agree
with
you
except
to
this
part
of
the
setting.
if
this
material
had
never
been
classified,
i
think
we
would
have
a
considerably
greater
difficulty
in
coming
in
and
saying
--
well
for
example,
suppose
the
material
had
been
included
in
a
public
speech
made
by
the
president
of
united
states.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
alright
but
we
come
in
and
say,
you
can’t
print
this
because
it
will
gravely
affect
the
security
of
united
states,
i
think
we
would
plainly
be
out.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
or
suppose
it
had
been
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
in
large
part,
yes
mr.
justice
but
i’m
still
trying
to
get
some
help
from
the
background
and
the
setting
which
i
repeat
it
is
not
irrelevant
that
the
concatenation
of
words
here
is
the
property
of
the
united
states,
that
this
has
been
classified
under
executive
orders
approved
by
congress
and
that
it
obviously
has
been
improperly
acquired.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
alright
mr.
justice,
i
repeat,
unless
we
can
show
that
this
will
have
grave
and
i
think
i
would
like
to
amend
it
the
--
i
know
the
court’s
order
has
said
immediate,
but
i
think
it
really
ought
to
be
irreparable
harm
to
the
security
of
united
states.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
i
think
mr.
justice
that
is
true,
but
i
also
think
the
heart
of
our
case
is
that
the
publication
of
the
material
specified
in
my
closed
brief
will
as
i
have
tried
to
argue
there,
materially
affect
the
security
of
united
states.
it
will
affect
lives,
it
will
affect
the
process
of
determination
of
the
war.
it
will
affect
the
process
of
recovering
prisoners
of
war.
i
cannot
say
that
determination
of
the
war
or
recovering
prisoners
of
war
is
something
which
has
an
immediate
effect
on
the
security
of
united
states.
i
say
that
it
has
such
an
effect
on
the
security
of
united
states
that
it
ought
to
be
the
basis
of
an
injunction
in
this
case.
now,
i
would
like
to
get
to
the
question
of
the
standard
which
was
used
by
the
district
judge
in
this
case.
i
think
it
is
relevant
to
point
out
that
on
page
267
of
the
closed
--
of
the
transcript
in
the
district
court
before
judge
gesell,
he
said,
“the
court
further
finds
that
publication
of
the
documents
in
the
large
may
interfere
with
the
ability
of
the
department
under
the
state
in
the
conduct
of
delicate
negotiations
now
in
process,
not
in
the
past,
now
in
process
or
contemplated
for
the
future
whether
this
negotiations
involve
southeast
asia
or
other
areas
of
the
world.
this
is
not
so
much
because
of
anything
in
the
documents
themselves,
but
rather
results
from
the
fact
that
it
will
appear
to
foreign
governments
that
this
government
is
unable
to
prevent
publication
of
actual
government
communications
when
a
leak
such
as
the
present
one
occurs.”
now,
thus
the
judge
rejected
as
a
standard
in
this
matter
the
whole
question
of
the
ability
of
the
department
of
state
and
that
means
the
president
to
whom
the
foreign
relations
are
conferred
by
the
constitution
to
conduct
delicate
negotiations,
now
in
process
are
contemplated
for
the
future.
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
it
is
perfectly
obvious
that
the
conduct
of
delicate
negotiations
now
in
process
are
contemplated
for
the
future
has
an
impact
on
the
security
of
the
united
states.
now,
the
standard
which
the
judge
did
apply
is
one
which
--
with
the
benefit
of
--
with
the
benefit
of
20/20
hindsight,
i
would
have
written
differently.
executive
order
10501
provides
the
basis
for
security
classification
issued
by
president
eisenhower
in
1953
after
a
comprehensive
study
by
a
commission
on
these
matters.
and
the
definition
of
top
secret
in
section
1
(a)
of
executive
order
10501
is,
“top
secret
shall
be
authorized
by
appropriate
authority
only
for
defense
information
or
material
which
requires
the
highest
degree
of
protection.
the
top
secret
classification
shall
be
applied
only
to
that
information
or
material
that
the
defense
aspect
of
which
is
paramount
and
the
unauthorized
disclosure
of
which
could
result
in
exceptionally
grave
damage
to
the
nation
such
as,”
now
this
was
not
intended
to
be
all
inclusive,
it
is
illustrative,
“such
as
leading
to
a
definite
break
in
diplomatic
relations,
affecting
the
defense
of
the
united
states,
an
armed
against
the
united
states
or
its
allies,
a
war
or
the
compromise
of
military
or
defense
plans
or
intelligence
operations
or
scientific
or
technological
developments
vital
to
the
national
defense”
and
what
judge
gesell
has
--
he
had
--
judge
gesell
has
used
that
as
the
standard.
he
made
no
reference
whatever
to
the
succeeding
classification
which
is
secret
and
there
is
also
a
classification
which
is
confidential,
but
judge
gesell
has
used
as
the
basis
of
his
decision
and
i
suggest
this
was
fundamental
error
that
there
is
no
proof,
this
is
on
page
269
of
the
transcript
of
the
hearing
before
judge
gesell,
there
is
no
proof
that
there
will
be
a
definite
break
in
diplomatic
relations,
that
there
will
be
an
armed
attack
on
the
united
states,
that
there
will
be
an
armed
attack
on
an
ally,
that
there
will
be
a
war,
that
there
will
a
compromise
of
military
or
defense
plans
and
i
in
my
closed
brief,
i
contend
that
he
was
wrong
on
that,
a
compromise
of
intelligence
operations
and
then
my
closed
brief,
i
contend
that
he
was
plainly
wrong
on
that
or
a
compromise
of
scientific
and
technological
materials.
and
if
the
standard
is
that
we
cannot
prevent
the
publication
of
improperly
acquired
material
unless
we
can
show
in
substance
in
effect
because
that’s
what
he
really
meant
that
there
will
be
a
break
in
diplomatic
relations
or
that
there
will
be
an
arm
detect
on
the
united
states,
i
suggest
that
the
standard
which
judge
gesell
used
is
far
too
narrow.
now
perhaps
it
lies
in
between.
my
own
thought
would
be
that
in
the
present
(inaudible)
state
of
the
world,
considering
negotiations
in
the
middle
east,
considering
the
salt
talks
now
going
on
and
it's
perhaps
not
inappropriate
to
remember
that
salt
is
strategic
arms
limitation
talks,
the
consequences
of
which
obviously
have
in
all
likelihood
not
the
prevention
of
a
nuclear
attack
tomorrow,
maybe
not
next
week.
but
only
by
a
success
in
this
kind
of
negation,
can
we
have
any
hope
that
our
children
and
our
children’s
children
will
have
a
world
to
live
in.
i
suggest
that
when
it
is
found
by
the
district
court
that
the
publication
of
the
documents
in
the
large
may
interfere
with
the
ability
of
the
department
of
state
in
the
conduct
of
delicate
negotiations
now
in
process
are
contemplated
for
the
future,
that
should
be
enough
by
itself
to
warrant
a
restraint
on
the
publication
of
the
now
quite
narrowly
selected
group
of
materials
covered
in
the
special
appendix
and
dealt
with
in
some
detail
in
my
closed
brief
and
the
related
papers
which
had
been
filed
with
the
court
this
morning.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
i
think
i
can’t
agree
with
that.
it
is
our
position
that
judge
gesell
used
the
wrong
standard
as
i
have
just
said
and
it
is
our
view
that
the
judgment
of
the
second
circuit
should
be
affirmed
and
the
case
remanded
to
judge
gurfein
for
further
hearing
under
a
proper
standard
which
i
hope
this
court
will
develop
and
announce
and
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
reversed
and
the
case
remanded
to
judge
gesell
for
further
hearing
and
the
application
of
the
proper
standard
which
this
court
has
decided.
because
it
is
our
view
as
i
have
endeavored
to
contend
that
in
rational
terms
in
the
modern
world,
the
standard
that
judge
gesell
applied
is
just
too
narrow
that
and
as
i
have
said
that
the
standard
should
be
great
and
irreparable
harm
to
the
security
of
united
states
in
the
whole
diplomatic
area,
the
things
don’t
happen
at
8:15
tomorrow
morning
and
maybe
weeks
or
months.
people
tell
me
that
already
channels
the
communication
on
which
a
great
hope
had
been
placed
have
dried
up.
i
haven't
a
slightest
doubt
myself
that
the
material
which
has
already
been
published
and
the
publication
of
the
other
materials
affects
american
lives
and
is
a
thoroughly
serious
matter.
and
i
think
that
to
say
that
it
can
only
be
enjoined
if
there
will
be
a
war
tomorrow
morning
when
there
is
a
war
now
going
on
is
much
too
narrow.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
make
it
plain
that
we
are
not
at
all
concerned
with
past
events
in
this
case.
we
are
not
interested
in
protecting
anybody,
that
should
be
obvious
enough
simply
from
the
date
of
the
materials
which
are
involved.
we
are
concerned
with
the
present
and
future
impact
of
the
publication
of
some
of
this
material
and
when
i
say
future,
i
don’t
mean
in
the
21st
century,
but
i
also
don't
mean
to
limit
it
to
tomorrow
because
in
this
area,
events
of
great
consequence
to
the
united
states
happen
over
periods
of
six
months,
a
year,
perhaps
two
or
three
years.
what
we
are
concerned
with
is
the
impact
on
the
present
and
the
reasonably
near
future
of
the
publication
of
these
events,
of
these
materials.
now
it
is
perfectly
true
that
prior
restraint
cases
with
respect
to
the
press
are
rare
or
conceivably
nonexistent.
i’m
not
ready
to
concede
that
they
are
nonexistent,
but
i
can’t
point
to
one
now.
i
hadn’t
had
time
to
make
a
really
thorough
research.
i
did
point
out
that
there
are
prior
restraint
cases
as
recently
as
last
term
with
respect
to
freedom
of
speech
which
is
the
first
amendment
in
exactly
the
same
terms
as
the
freedom
of
the
press.
and
there
is
the
associated
press
case
which
comes
about
as
close
to
being
a
prior
restraint
on
the
press
case
as
you
can
get
without
perhaps
being
technically
a
prior
restraint
case.
the
reason
of
course
that
there
are
not
prior
restraint
cases
with
respect
to
the
press
is
that
ordinarily
you
don’t
find
out
about
it
until
it’s
been
published.
reference
has
been
made
to
the
fact
oh!
there
are
leaks
all
the
time,
there
are
great
many
leaks,
but
i
would
point
out
that
there
is
also
a
very
widespread
respect
of
the
security
classification
system
and
its
potentiality
on
the
security
of
the
united
states.
senator
fulbright
did
not
publish
this
material.
he
sent
it
to
the
secretary
of
defense
or
requested
from
the
secretary
of
defense
of
what
use
he
could
make
of
it
and
i
have
seen
on
the
television
other
members
of
congress
who
said
that
they
had
some
of
the
material,
but
felt
not
appropriate
to
use
it
because
it
was
classified
top
secret.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it’s
hard
for
me
to
answer
the
question
in
such
broad
terms.
i
think
that
if
properly
classified
materials
are
improperly
acquired
and
that
it
can
be
shown
that
they
do
have
a
--
an
immediate
or
current
impact
on
the
security
of
the
united
states
that
there
ought
to
be
an
--
there
ought
to
be
an
injunction.
now
i
think
it
is
relevant
at
this
point
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that's
a
pejorative
way
to
put
it
mr.
justice.
i
don’t
know
what
the
alternative
is.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice
and
we
are
of
course
fully
supporting
the
first
amendment.
the
--
we
do
not
claim
or
suggest
any
exception
of
the
first
amendment
and
we
do
not
agree
with
mr.
glendon
when
he
says
that
we
set
aside
the
first
amendment
or
that
judge
gesell
or
the
two
courts
of
appeals
in
this
case
have
set
aside
the
first
amendment
by
issuing
the
injunction
which
they
have.
the
problem
in
this
case
is
the
construction
of
the
first
amendment.
now
mr.
justice
black,
your
construction
of
that
is
well
known
and
i
certainly
respect
it.
you
say
that
no
law
means
no
law
and
that
should
be
obvious.
and
i
can
only
say
mr.
justice
that
to
me,
it
is
equally
obvious
that
no
law
does
not
mean
no
law
and
i
would
seek
to
persuade
the
court
that
that
is
true.
as
chief
justice
marshall
said
so
long
ago,
it
is
a
constitution
we
are
interpreting
and
all
we
ask
for
here
is
the
construction
of
the
constitution
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
it
is
a
part
of
the
constitution
and
that
there
are
other
parts
of
the
constitution
which
grants
powers
and
responsibilities
to
the
executive.
and
that
the
first
amendment
was
not
intended
to
make
it
impossible
for
the
executive
to
function
or
to
protect
the
security
of
the
united
states.
now,
it’s
been
suggested
that
the
government
move
very
slowly
in
this
matter,
that
the
time
started
publishing
on
sunday.
well
actually
it
was
on
monday
which
is
pretty
fast
as
the
government
operates
in
terms
of
the
consultations
that
had
to
be
made.
the
policy
decisions
it
had
to
be
made.
on
monday,
the
attorney
general
sent
a
telegram
to
the
new
york
times,
asked
them
to
stop
and
to
return
the
documents.
the
new
york
times
refused
and
on
tuesday,
the
united
states
started
this
suit.
it’s
suggested
that
there
had
been
full
hearing,
everything
has
been
carefully
and
thoroughly
considered,
but
there
is
clear
evidence
of
haste
in
both
records
and
this
is
apparent
from
the
times
which
have
been
stated
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
even
now
at
this
point,
the
hearing
is
on
the
question
whether
a
preliminary
injunction
should
be
granted.
the
only
hearings
that
have
been
held
in
any
courts
are
as
to
whether
a
preliminary
injunction
should
be
granted.
they
were
no
intended
to
be
full
plenary
trials,
but
merely
sufficient
to
show
the
probability
of
possible
success.
there
is
simply
was
not
time
to
prepare
a
comprehensive
listing
or
a
comprehensive
array
of
expert
witnesses.
the
government
relied
on
the
fact
that
the
district
judge
would
examine
the
study
and
he
on
the
record,
concededly
refused
to
do
so.
this
was
at
the
heart
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
in
its
decision
to
remand
for
a
full
week
of
hearings
on
the
merits.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no.
that
there
had
not
been
a
full
hearing
with
respect
to
this
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i’m
talking
about
the
new
york
times,
this
case
is
in
the
second
circuit,
and
the
second
circuit
sent
it
back
to
the
judge
for
rehearing
with
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
the
contrary
mr.
justice,
the
full
47
volumes
were
offered
judge
gurfein
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
and
he
refused
to
examine.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice,
he
wouldn’t
examine
them.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
i
think
that
really
came
at
a
later
stage
in
that
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
they
sent
it
back
not
for
an
instant
hearing,
but
for
one
limited,
properly
so.
everything
about
this
case
has
been
fronted.
that
seems
to
me
to
be
the
most
unfortunate
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
new
york
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
a
very
serious
matter.
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
and
so
is
the
security
of
the
united
states
a
very
serious
matter
and
we
have
two
important
constitutional
objectives
here
which
have
to
be
weighed
and
balanced
and
made
as
harmonious
as
they
can
be.
but,
it
is
well
know
that
at
the
times
had
this
material
for
three
months.
it’s
only
after
the
times
has
had
an
opportunity
to
digest
it
and
it
took
them
three
months
to
digest
it,
that
it
became
necessary
to
be
frantic
about
it.
it
wasn’t
so
terribly
important
to
get
it
out
and
get
it
to
the
public
while
the
times
were
working
over
it,
but
after
that,
now
the
times
finds
it
extremely
difficult
to
except
an
opportunity
for
the
courts
to
have
an
adequate
chance
first
to
resolve
the
extremely
difficult
question
of
the
proper
construction
of
the
first
amendment
in
this
situation
and
i
can
see
that’s
an
extremely
difficult
question.
and
if
it
--
if
the
proper
construction
is
the
one
which
mr.
justice
black
has
taken
for
a
long
time
and
is
well
known,
of
course,
there’s
nothing
more
to
be
said,
but
our
contention
is
that
that
is
not
the
proper
construction.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
very
reluctantly,
they
were
pushed
into
conceding
that
there
might
be
some
cases
where
there
could
be
those
suggested
in
the
opinion
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
frankly
i
don’t
think
it’s
much
of
a
limitation
to
say
that
it
can
be
enjoined
if
it
will
result
in
a
break
of
diplomatic
relations
or
a
war
tomorrow
and
as
i
have
already
said,
we
think
the
standard
used
by
judge
gesell
is
wrong.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
i
think
--
i’m
sorry
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i’m
not
sure
what
standard
judge
gurfein
used.
judge
gesell,
because
much
of
this
material
judge
gurfein
did
not
have
specifically
called
to
his
attention.
the
standard
which
judge
gesell
used
is
to
say
that
unless
it
comes
within
that
illustrative
language
and
the
definition
of
top
secret
that
it
does
not
meet
the
requirement
and
i
contend
that
that
is
wrong.
i
believe
and
have
sought
to
show
in
the
closed
brief
which
is
filed
here
that
there
are
materials
and
there
are
items
in
this
material
which
will
affect
the
problem
of
the
termination
of
the
war
in
vietnam
which
will
affect
negotiations
such
as
the
salt
talks
which
affects
the
security
of
united
states
vitality
over
a
long
period
and
which
will
affect
the
problem
of
return
of
prisoners
of
war.
and
i
suggest
that,
however,
it
is
formulating,
the
standard
ought
to
be
one
which
will
make
it
possible
to
prevent
the
publication
of
materials
which
will
have
those
consequences.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
say
in
respect
of
the
announcement
just
made
that
all
three
parties
have
filed
a
closed
brief
as
well
as
the
open
brief
and
in
addition,
i
have
filed
just
within
minutes,
two
statements,
one
prepared
by
the
state
department
and
one
prepared
by
the
department
of
defense,
giving
more
detail
about
some
of
the
items
which
are
discussed
in
my
closed
brief
and
i
believe
that
those
will
all
be
before
the
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
only
ones
that
are
security
matters
that
i
have
filed
are
all
marked
top
secret.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
items
filed
by
the
post
and
the
times,
i
do
not
believe
are
marked
top
secret,
but
they
are
marked
in-camera
in
the
caption
of
the
items.
i
repeat,
all
three
have
also
filed
regular
briefs
except
not
printed,
only
the
american
civil
liberties
union
seem
to
have
the
resources
to
produce
a
printed
brief
for
this
case.
i
am
told
that
the
law
students
of
today
are
indignantly
opposed
to
final
examinations
because
they
say
that
no
lawyer
has
asked
to
work
under
such
pressure
that
he
as
to
get
things
out
in
three
or
four
hours.
i
can
only
say
that
i
think
it’s
perhaps
fortunate
that
mr.
glendon
and
mr.
bickel
and
i
went
to
law
school
under
earlier
dispensation.
it
is
important
i
think
to
get
this
case
in
perspective.
the
case
of
course
raises
important
and
difficult
problems
about
the
constitutional
right
of
free
speech
and
of
the
free
press
and
we’ve
heard
much
about
that
from
the
press
in
the
last
two
weeks.
but
it
also
raises
important
questions
of
the
equally
fundamental
and
important
right
of
the
government
to
function.
great
emphasis
has
been
put
on
the
first
amendment
and
rightly
so.
but
there
is
also
involved
here
a
fundamental
question
of
separation
of
powers
in
the
sense
of
the
power
and
authority
which
the
constitution
allocates
to
the
president
as
chief
executive
and
as
commander-in-chief
of
the
army
and
navy
and
involved
in
that,
there
is
also
the
question
of
the
integrity
of
the
institution
of
the
presidency
whether
that
institution,
one
of
the
three
great
powers
under
the
separation
of
powers,
can
function
effectively.
the
problem
lies
on
a
wide
spectrum
and
like
all
questions
of
constitutional
law,
involves
the
resolution
of
competing
principles.
in
the
first
place
it
seems
to
me
that
it
will
be
helpful
to
make
some
preliminary
observations.
if
we
start
out
with
the
assumption
that
never
under
any
circumstances
can
the
press
be
subjected
to
prior
restraints,
never
under
any
circumstances
can
the
press
be
enjoined
from
publications,
of
course,
we
come
out
with
the
conclusion
that
there
can
be
no
injunction
here.
but
i
suggest,
not
as
necessarily
conclusive
in
this
case,
but
i
suggest
that
there
is
no
such
constitutional
rule
and
never
has
been
such
a
constitutional
rule.
we
have
for
example
the
copyright
laws
and
my
son
was
in
trial
earlier
this
week
and
he
sent
me
copies
of
the
globe
&
mail
of
toronto,
ten
series
of
the
story
that
pentagon
is
trying
to
kill,
each
one
added
copyright
new
york
times
service.
i
have
no
objection
to
that,
but
i
--
these
stories
which
had
then
published
have
been
copyrighted
by
the
new
york
times
and
i
believe
by
the
portion
imposed
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
perhaps
in
other
cases
because
these
have
already
attracted
much
attention,
the
new
york
times
and
the
washington
post
would
seek
to
enforce
their
copyright.
i
suppose
it
is
very
likely
that
in
one
form
or
another,
they
have
obtained
royalties
because
of
their
copyright
on
this
matter,
but
let
us
also
consider
other
fields
of
the
law.
there
is
a
well
known
branch
of
the
law
that
goes
under
the
heading
of
“literary
property.”
in
the
court
of
appeals,
i
gave
the
example
of
a
manuscript
written
by
earnest
hemingway,
let’s
assume
while
he
is
still
living,
unpublished,
perhaps
incomplete,
subject
to
revision.
in
some
way
the
press
gets
hold
of
it.
perhaps
it’s
stolen,
perhaps
it’s
bought
from
a
secretary
through
breech
of
fiduciary
responsibility
or
perhaps
it’s
filed
on
the
segue
and
if
the
new
york
times
sought
to
print
that,
i
have
no
doubt
that
mr.
hemingway
or
now
his
heirs
next
to
kin,
could
obtain
from
the
courts
an
injunction
against
the
press
printing.
only
this
morning,
i
see
in
the
paper
that
a
new
york
publisher
is
bringing
a
suit
against
newsday,
a
new
york
news
paper
because
newsday
has
violated
what
the
new
york
publisher
consists
says
considers
to
be
it’s
copyright
in
the
forthcoming
memoirs
of
president
johnson.
and
then
finally
or
not
finally,
but
next,
we
have
a
whole
series
of
law,
a
traditional
branch
of
equity,
involving
participation
and
the
breech
of
trust
and
there
cannot
be
the
slightest
doubt,
it
seems
to
me,
that
no
matter
what
the
motive,
no
matter
what
the
justification
that
both
the
new
york
times
and
the
washington
post
are
here
consciously,
intentionally
participating
in
a
breech
of
trust.
they
know
that
this
material
is
not
theirs,
they
do
not
own
it.
i’m
not
talking
about
the
pieces
of
paper
of
which
they
may
have
acquired
by
the
literary
property
and
again
i
say
i
don’t
regard
this
as
controlling
or
conclusive
in
this
case.
i’m
simply
trying
to
advance
the
proposition
that
there
are
many
factors
and
many
facets
here
and
that
there
is
no
constitutional
rule
that
there
can
never
be
prior
restraints
on
the
press
or
on
free
speech.
now
in
our
main
brief
in
this
case,
we
have
which
i
may
say
was
largely
prepared
by
my
associate
mr.
friedman,
last
evening
and
last
night.
we
have
cited
one
case
which
comes
very
close
to
being
a
injunction
by
this
court
against
publications
in
the
press
and
that
is
the
associated
press
case
in
i
believe
215
united
states.
the
associated
press
is
a
cooperative
of
newspapers
and
there,
the
associated
press
sought
and
obtained
an
injunction
against
the
dissemination
of
news
by
its
competitor
united
or
international
press
in
that
case
not
united
by
its
competitor
international
and
that
was
granted
on
copyright
and
related
grounds.
but
we
have
other
areas
in
the
law
where
this
court
has
approved
against
specific
first
amendment
claims,
injunctions
in
advance
forbidding
speech.
one
area
of
this
is
the
labor
law
field
where
as
recently
is
395
u.s.
in
sinclair
against
the
national
labor
relations
board,
the
court
unanimously
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
enforcing
the
board's
order
which
included
a
provision
requiring
sinclair
to
cease
and
desist
from
the
threatening
the
employees
with
the
possible
closing
of
the
plant
or
the
transfer
of
the
weaving
production
with
the
attendant
loss
of
employment
or
with
any
other
economic
reprisals,
if
they
were
to
select
the
above
named
or
any
other
labor
organization.
in
393
u.s,
a
case
involving
the
federal
trade
commission,
federal
trade
commission
against
the
tex
--
against
texaco
inc.,
involving
orders
with
respect
to
tba,
tires,
battery
and
accessories,
the
court
approved
the
order
of
the
federal
trade
commission
which
restrained
texaco
from
using
or
attempting
to
use
any
device
such
as,
but
not
limited
to,
dealer
discussions,
they
were
ordered
not
to
speak
to
dealers
about
this
subject
and
the
first
amendment
was
specifically
referred
to
in
the
brief
for
the
respondent
and
was
not
mentioned
in
this
court’s
opinion.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice
if
they
have
conceded
it,
i
am
glad
to
proceed
on
that
basis.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
may
say
that
their
brief
were
served
on
me
within
the
last
15
minutes
which
--
the
last
hour
which
was
entirely
in
accordance
with
this
court’s
order,
but
i
have
not
seen
their
briefs.
i
do
not
know
what
is
in
their
briefs.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
that
mr.
justice
is
extremely
difficult
to
discuss
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--in
open
court
and
we
have
endeavored
to
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice
white,
it
was
the
latter
point
for
which
i
was
seeking
to
get
this
because
our
contention,
particularly
with
respect
to
the
washington
post
case
is
that
the
wrong
standard
has
been
used.
now
with
respect
to
the
actual
factual
situations,
the
only
thing
that
i
can
do
is
to
point
to
the
closed
brief,
which
i
have
filed
in
which
there
are
ten
specific
items
referred
to.
now
when
i
say
specific
items,
i
must
be
--
i
must
make
myself
very
clear.
some
of
those
are
collective.
there
are
--
i
have
brought
here,
you
perhaps
can’t
see
them,
the
47
volumes
that
are
supposed
to
be
the
background
of
this,
they
are
included
in
the
record
of
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
has
been
filed
with
the
court.
let
me
say
when
we
move
on
to
this
next
item
that
it
was
inevitable
that
i
delegate
the
question
of
preparing
the
supplemental
statement
which
was
covered
by
this
court’s
order
yesterday.
this
court,
as
did
the
second
circuit,
referred
to
the
material
specified
in
the
special
appendix
in
the
second
circuit
and
to
such
additional
items
as
might
be
included
on
a
supplemental
statement
filed
at
5:00
pm
yesterday.
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
preparing
that
supplemental
statement.
i
have
able
and
conscientious
associates
who
did
work
on
it.
however,
when
i
had
a
chance
to
see
it
last
evening,
particularly
after
the
state
department
called
me
at
8:00
or
9:00
at
night
and
said
they
had
four
additional
items,
and
i
said
that
the
court’s
deadline
was
5:00
pm
and
that
i
could
not
add
any
additional
items.
i
then
examined
it.
here
is
a
copy
and
i
find
it
much
too
broad.
in
particular,
it
has
at
the
end
a
statement,
in
view
of
the
uncertainties
as
to
the
précised
documents
in
defendant’s
custody
and
i
say
that
is
a
--
has
been
an
extreme
difficulty
in
this
matter.
we
don’t
know
now,
never
have
know
what
the
papers
have.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
prepared
an
inventory
but
from
it,
it
is
not
possible
to
tell
whether
they
are
the
same
papers
that
we
have.
part
of
the
problem
here
is
that
a
great
mass
of
this
material
is
not
included
in
the
47
volumes.
it
is
a
background
material,
earlier
drafts
of
some
papers
which
are
materially
different
than
what
is
included
in
the
47
volumes
and
as
a
result,
we
cannot
tell
from
the
inventory
what
is
included.
for
example,
one
of
the
items
already
published
which
has
caused
a
certain
amount
of
controversy,
publicly
and
internationally,
is
a
telegram
to
the
canadian
government,
that
is
not
in
the
47
volumes
and
is
not
referred
to
in
the
47
volumes.
where
they
got
it,
how
they
got
it,
what
it
is,
i
do
not
know.
but
in
this
supplemental
memorandum,
it
is
stated
under
my
signature
that
the
petitioner
specifies
an
addition
to
the
foregoing
any
information
relating
to
the
following
and
then
there
are
listed
13
items
and
frankly
i
regard
that
as
much
too
broad.
and
therefore,
i
am
saying
here
that
we
rely
with
respect
to
this
factual
question
only
on
the
items
specified
in
the
supplemental
appendix,
filed
in
the
second
circuit
and
on
such
additional
items
as
are
covered
in
my
closed
brief
in
this
case.
those
additional
items
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice,
it
does
not
refer
to
all
of
them.
what
i
tried
to
do
in
my
closed
brief
was
i
spent
all
yesterday
afternoon
in
constant
successive
conversation
with
the
individuals
from
the
state
department,
the
defense
department,
the
national
security
agency
and
i
said
“look,
tell
me
what
are
the
words,
tell
me
what
are
the
things
that
really
make
trouble.”
and
they
told
me
and
i
made
long-hand
notes
of
what
they
told
me
and
from
that
i
prepared
the
closed
brief.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
think
that
the
odds
are
strong
that
that
is
an
accurate
statement.
i
must
say
that
i
have
not
examined
everyone
of
the
items.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
that
there
ought
to
be
an
opportunity
for
a
full
and
free
judicial
consideration
of
each
of
the
items
covered
in
the
supplemental
appendix.
now,
it's
perfectly
true
that
there
was
a
trial
before
judge
gesell
in
the
district
court
of
the
united
states.
i
referred
to
it
in
my
closed
brief
as
hastily
conducted
and
i
have
said
that
i
--
there
was
no
trace
of
criticism
in
that.
judge
gesell
started
the
trial
at
8:00
last
monday
morning
and
was
under
order
from
the
court
of
appeals
to
have
a
decision
made
by
5:00
pm
and
there
are
47
volumes
of
material
and
millions
of
words
and
there
are
people
in
various
agency
to
the
government
who
have
to
be
consulted
and
mr.
glendon
quite
appropriately
conducted
cross
examination
which
took
time
and
much
of
the
material
had
to
be
presented
by
affidavits
and
there
simply
has
not
been
a
full
careful
consideration
of
this
material.
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
based
on
what
was
told
to
me
yesterday
afternoon
by
the
concerned
persons,
the
ten
items
in
my
supplemental
--
in
my
closed
brief
are
the
ones
on
which
we
most
rely
but
i
have
not
seen
a
great
many
of
the
other
items
in
the
special
appendix
simply
for
sheer
lack
of
time.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
trial
in
the
district
of
columbia
occurred
between
8:00
am
and
5:00
pm,
including
the
decision
last
monday.
i
participated
in
the
oral
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
it
occupied
two
hours
and
a
half,
two
hours
and
forty-five
minutes.
started
at
about
2:15
and
was
over
i
think
just
before
5:00
that
is
the
entire
amount
of
judicial
time
which
has
been
devoted
to
million
of
words.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i’m
not
sure
whether
this
case
turns
on
classification.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
judicial
proceeding
has
been
brought
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
by
either
newspaper.
there
is
provision
there
for
citing
a
proceeding
in
court
in
case
materials
are
wrongly
determined.
no
judicial
determination
has
been
made
that
any
classification
was
arbitrary
or
capricious.
there
is
a
complication
here
which
people
who
lived
with
this
become
familiar
with,
which
is
that
is
any
compilation
takes
the
classification
of
the
highest
classified
item.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
it
need
not
be
answered,
but
my
position
would
be
that
as
to
those
10
items,
it’s
more
than
10
documents
as
to
those
10
items
that
they
are
properly
classified
top
secret.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
one
of
the
items,
i
should
make
plain
is
four
volumes
of
the
47
volumes,
four
related
volumes,
all
dealing
with
one
specific
subject.
the
broaching
of
which
to
the
entire
world
at
this
time
would
be
of
extraordinary
seriousness
to
the
security
of
the
united
states
and
as
i
say
that
is
covered
in
my
closed
brief
and
i’m
not
free
to
say
more
about
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
would
still
be
here,
but
would
have
one
string
off
my
book.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
it
maybe
this,
but
there
are
those
who
think
it
is
and
i
must
be
careful
not
to
concede
away
in
this
court
grounds
with
some
responsible
officers
of
the
government,
i
think
how
important,
but
i
do
understand
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice
but
i
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
i
don’t
--
i
don’t
think
that
literary
property
is
wholly
irrelevant
here,
but
my
case
does
not
depend
upon
it.
and
i
say
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice
but
i
think
that
the
fact
that
it
was
obviously
acquired
improperly
is
not
irrelevant
in
the
consideration
of
that
question
and
i
repeat
obviously
acquired
improperly.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
my
understanding
mr.
justice,
though
i
have
not
had
an
opportunity
to
read
everything
that
has
been
published
in
other
newspapers.
it
is
my
understanding
that
except
with
respect
to
the
items
in
the
new
york
times,
the
washington
post
and
the
boston
globe,
there
has
not
been
published
anything
else
which
is
not
covered
by
material
already
published
either
in
this
series
or
elsewhere.
it
would
appear
to
us
that
other
papers
have
sought
to
get
into
the
act
and
they
have
assigned
their
writers
to
write
what
you
can,
but
we
have
not
been
able
to
find
new
disclosures
of
previously
unpublished
material
in
these
other
articles.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
do
not
know.
i
have
no
information
whatever.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no.
the
only
information
that
i
have
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
is
a
possibility
that
anybody
has
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
i
appreciate
that.
i
am
trying
to
say
that
on
the
basis
of
the
information
now
known,
this
is
not
that
situation.
i
repeat,
i
have
not
read
these
other
articles,
i
am
advised
by
people
who
have
that
they
do
not
contain
a
new
disclosures
that
they
are
--
it’s
now
becoming
fashionable
and
popular,
you
are
not
a
good
newspaper
unless
you
got
some
of
this
stuff
and
that
they
had
put
out
articles
with
all
kinds
window
dressing,
probably
very
well
written,
but
not
containing
new
disclosures.
i
am
not
able
to
testify
to
that
and
i
can’t
point
to
anything
in
the
record
which
supports
that.
certainly
we
are
concerned
about
the
problem
of
the
effectiveness
of
any
order
which
might
be
issued
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
not
to
issue
useless
injunction
and
it
is
our
position
that
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
or
known
outside
the
record
which
would
indicate
that
this
injunction
would
be
useless.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
we
don’t
know
what
they
have
or
how
they
got
it
nor
do
--
that
matter
is
equally
true
with
the
new
york
times
and
the
washington
post.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
denied
that
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don’t
know.
i
don’t
believe
that
has
been
an
issue
in
the
washington
post
case
or
was
anything
like
that
in
the
--
mr.
seymour
advises
me
there
was
nothing
like
that
in
the
new
york
times
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
i
think
that
at
that
point,
we
would
agree
that
it
becomes
futile,
it
is
a
useless
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
would
think
so
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
would
think
so
yes.
i
may
say
that
it
was
--
both
--
stated
in
both
lower
courts
in
new
york
by
mr.
seymour
and
here
by
me
that
the
president
last
january
directed
a
complete
review
of
classification
of
all
materials.
several
secretaries
of
state
defense
and
the
chairman
of
the
joint
chiefs
of
staff
authorized
us
then
to
say
that
they
are
prepared
to
appoint
immediately
a
joint
task
force
to
conduct
an
exhaustive
declassification
study
of
the
47
volumes.
that
they
will
conduct
a
study
on
an
expedited
basis
and
will
complete
it
within
any
reasonable
time
that
the
court
may
choose.
they
suggest
a
minimum
of
45
days
and
upon
completion
of
the
study,
the
government
will
withdraw
its
objection
for
the
publication
of
any
documents
which
it
is
found
no
longer
relevant
to
the
national
security.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
not
involved
in
this
case,
in
this
court
at
this
time.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
can
certainly
say
the
government
would
like
to
get
them
back.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
government
is
not
at
this
time
seeking
an
order
for
their
return.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
believe
it
was,
but
we
did
not
appeal
with
respect
to
that
nor
is
it
covered
in
our
petition
for
certiorari.
is
that
not
right?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
will
urge
the
government
to
do
it
anyhow.
of
course,
if
this
court
does
not
allow
any
injunction,
it
will
be
feudal
because
the
material
will
be
published
and
there
won’t
be
any
particular
–
entirely
postmortem
to
say
“well
it
was
alright
anyhow.”
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
study
is
going
to
be
made.
i
will
do
my
best
to
see
that
the
study
is
made
and
i
believe
i
have
the
full
support
of
the
entire
administration
with
respect
to
that.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i’m
sorry
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
(voice
overlap)yes,
mr.
justice
except
that
it’s
a
massive
operation.
there
isn't
a
slightest
doubt
in
my
mind
that
there
has
been,
as
long
as
i
can
remember
which
is
quite
awhile,
a
massive
over
classification
of
material
and
there
has
been
much
too
slow
review
to
provide
declassification
and
the
government
is
in
the
process
of
taking
steps
to
try
to
find
a
way
to
work
that
problem
out.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
the
court
should
rule
against
us
here,
then
i
--
then
it
seems
to
me
that
it
becomes
moot
with
respect
to
these
items,
they
can
be
published
and
whether
we
classify
them
or
declassify
them
as
an
academic
question.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
court
will
in
effect
have
declassified
the
materials.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
you
are
certainly
right
mr.
justice.
if
i
may
say
so
in
terms
of
an
examination
question,
i
find
it
exceedingly
difficult
to
think
that
any
jury
would
convict
or
as
an
appellate
court
would
affirm
a
conviction
of
a
criminal
offense
for
the
publication
of
materials
which
this
court
had
said
could
be
published
as
simply
is
the
practical
matter
whether
it
was
a
crime
or
not.
well,
these
are
the
same
materials
that
were
involved
in
the
new
york
times
case.
all
we
did
was
publish
them
and
i
find
it
difficult
to
think
that
such
case
should
be
prosecuted
or
could
if
they
(inaudible)
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it’s
not
the
same
issue
and
i
repeat,
i
think
it
would
be
technically
be
a
crime
if
the
materials
remain
classified.
now
i
would
like
to
get
on
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
nor
because
we
own
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
agree
with
you
except
to
this
part
of
the
setting.
if
this
material
had
never
been
classified,
i
think
we
would
have
a
considerably
greater
difficulty
in
coming
in
and
saying
--
well
for
example,
suppose
the
material
had
been
included
in
a
public
speech
made
by
the
president
of
united
states.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
alright
but
we
come
in
and
say,
you
can’t
print
this
because
it
will
gravely
affect
the
security
of
united
states,
i
think
we
would
plainly
be
out.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
or
suppose
it
had
been
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
in
large
part,
yes
mr.
justice
but
i’m
still
trying
to
get
some
help
from
the
background
and
the
setting
which
i
repeat
it
is
not
irrelevant
that
the
concatenation
of
words
here
is
the
property
of
the
united
states,
that
this
has
been
classified
under
executive
orders
approved
by
congress
and
that
it
obviously
has
been
improperly
acquired.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
alright
mr.
justice,
i
repeat,
unless
we
can
show
that
this
will
have
grave
and
i
think
i
would
like
to
amend
it
the
--
i
know
the
court’s
order
has
said
immediate,
but
i
think
it
really
ought
to
be
irreparable
harm
to
the
security
of
united
states.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
i
think
mr.
justice
that
is
true,
but
i
also
think
the
heart
of
our
case
is
that
the
publication
of
the
material
specified
in
my
closed
brief
will
as
i
have
tried
to
argue
there,
materially
affect
the
security
of
united
states.
it
will
affect
lives,
it
will
affect
the
process
of
determination
of
the
war.
it
will
affect
the
process
of
recovering
prisoners
of
war.
i
cannot
say
that
determination
of
the
war
or
recovering
prisoners
of
war
is
something
which
has
an
immediate
effect
on
the
security
of
united
states.
i
say
that
it
has
such
an
effect
on
the
security
of
united
states
that
it
ought
to
be
the
basis
of
an
injunction
in
this
case.
now,
i
would
like
to
get
to
the
question
of
the
standard
which
was
used
by
the
district
judge
in
this
case.
i
think
it
is
relevant
to
point
out
that
on
page
267
of
the
closed
--
of
the
transcript
in
the
district
court
before
judge
gesell,
he
said,
“the
court
further
finds
that
publication
of
the
documents
in
the
large
may
interfere
with
the
ability
of
the
department
under
the
state
in
the
conduct
of
delicate
negotiations
now
in
process,
not
in
the
past,
now
in
process
or
contemplated
for
the
future
whether
this
negotiations
involve
southeast
asia
or
other
areas
of
the
world.
this
is
not
so
much
because
of
anything
in
the
documents
themselves,
but
rather
results
from
the
fact
that
it
will
appear
to
foreign
governments
that
this
government
is
unable
to
prevent
publication
of
actual
government
communications
when
a
leak
such
as
the
present
one
occurs.”
now,
thus
the
judge
rejected
as
a
standard
in
this
matter
the
whole
question
of
the
ability
of
the
department
of
state
and
that
means
the
president
to
whom
the
foreign
relations
are
conferred
by
the
constitution
to
conduct
delicate
negotiations,
now
in
process
are
contemplated
for
the
future.
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
it
is
perfectly
obvious
that
the
conduct
of
delicate
negotiations
now
in
process
are
contemplated
for
the
future
has
an
impact
on
the
security
of
the
united
states.
now,
the
standard
which
the
judge
did
apply
is
one
which
--
with
the
benefit
of
--
with
the
benefit
of
20/20
hindsight,
i
would
have
written
differently.
executive
order
10501
provides
the
basis
for
security
classification
issued
by
president
eisenhower
in
1953
after
a
comprehensive
study
by
a
commission
on
these
matters.
and
the
definition
of
top
secret
in
section
1
(a)
of
executive
order
10501
is,
“top
secret
shall
be
authorized
by
appropriate
authority
only
for
defense
information
or
material
which
requires
the
highest
degree
of
protection.
the
top
secret
classification
shall
be
applied
only
to
that
information
or
material
that
the
defense
aspect
of
which
is
paramount
and
the
unauthorized
disclosure
of
which
could
result
in
exceptionally
grave
damage
to
the
nation
such
as,”
now
this
was
not
intended
to
be
all
inclusive,
it
is
illustrative,
“such
as
leading
to
a
definite
break
in
diplomatic
relations,
affecting
the
defense
of
the
united
states,
an
armed
against
the
united
states
or
its
allies,
a
war
or
the
compromise
of
military
or
defense
plans
or
intelligence
operations
or
scientific
or
technological
developments
vital
to
the
national
defense”
and
what
judge
gesell
has
--
he
had
--
judge
gesell
has
used
that
as
the
standard.
he
made
no
reference
whatever
to
the
succeeding
classification
which
is
secret
and
there
is
also
a
classification
which
is
confidential,
but
judge
gesell
has
used
as
the
basis
of
his
decision
and
i
suggest
this
was
fundamental
error
that
there
is
no
proof,
this
is
on
page
269
of
the
transcript
of
the
hearing
before
judge
gesell,
there
is
no
proof
that
there
will
be
a
definite
break
in
diplomatic
relations,
that
there
will
be
an
armed
attack
on
the
united
states,
that
there
will
be
an
armed
attack
on
an
ally,
that
there
will
be
a
war,
that
there
will
a
compromise
of
military
or
defense
plans
and
i
in
my
closed
brief,
i
contend
that
he
was
wrong
on
that,
a
compromise
of
intelligence
operations
and
then
my
closed
brief,
i
contend
that
he
was
plainly
wrong
on
that
or
a
compromise
of
scientific
and
technological
materials.
and
if
the
standard
is
that
we
cannot
prevent
the
publication
of
improperly
acquired
material
unless
we
can
show
in
substance
in
effect
because
that’s
what
he
really
meant
that
there
will
be
a
break
in
diplomatic
relations
or
that
there
will
be
an
arm
detect
on
the
united
states,
i
suggest
that
the
standard
which
judge
gesell
used
is
far
too
narrow.
now
perhaps
it
lies
in
between.
my
own
thought
would
be
that
in
the
present
(inaudible)
state
of
the
world,
considering
negotiations
in
the
middle
east,
considering
the
salt
talks
now
going
on
and
it's
perhaps
not
inappropriate
to
remember
that
salt
is
strategic
arms
limitation
talks,
the
consequences
of
which
obviously
have
in
all
likelihood
not
the
prevention
of
a
nuclear
attack
tomorrow,
maybe
not
next
week.
but
only
by
a
success
in
this
kind
of
negation,
can
we
have
any
hope
that
our
children
and
our
children’s
children
will
have
a
world
to
live
in.
i
suggest
that
when
it
is
found
by
the
district
court
that
the
publication
of
the
documents
in
the
large
may
interfere
with
the
ability
of
the
department
of
state
in
the
conduct
of
delicate
negotiations
now
in
process
are
contemplated
for
the
future,
that
should
be
enough
by
itself
to
warrant
a
restraint
on
the
publication
of
the
now
quite
narrowly
selected
group
of
materials
covered
in
the
special
appendix
and
dealt
with
in
some
detail
in
my
closed
brief
and
the
related
papers
which
had
been
filed
with
the
court
this
morning.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
i
think
i
can’t
agree
with
that.
it
is
our
position
that
judge
gesell
used
the
wrong
standard
as
i
have
just
said
and
it
is
our
view
that
the
judgment
of
the
second
circuit
should
be
affirmed
and
the
case
remanded
to
judge
gurfein
for
further
hearing
under
a
proper
standard
which
i
hope
this
court
will
develop
and
announce
and
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
reversed
and
the
case
remanded
to
judge
gesell
for
further
hearing
and
the
application
of
the
proper
standard
which
this
court
has
decided.
because
it
is
our
view
as
i
have
endeavored
to
contend
that
in
rational
terms
in
the
modern
world,
the
standard
that
judge
gesell
applied
is
just
too
narrow
that
and
as
i
have
said
that
the
standard
should
be
great
and
irreparable
harm
to
the
security
of
united
states
in
the
whole
diplomatic
area,
the
things
don’t
happen
at
8:15
tomorrow
morning
and
maybe
weeks
or
months.
people
tell
me
that
already
channels
the
communication
on
which
a
great
hope
had
been
placed
have
dried
up.
i
haven't
a
slightest
doubt
myself
that
the
material
which
has
already
been
published
and
the
publication
of
the
other
materials
affects
american
lives
and
is
a
thoroughly
serious
matter.
and
i
think
that
to
say
that
it
can
only
be
enjoined
if
there
will
be
a
war
tomorrow
morning
when
there
is
a
war
now
going
on
is
much
too
narrow.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
make
it
plain
that
we
are
not
at
all
concerned
with
past
events
in
this
case.
we
are
not
interested
in
protecting
anybody,
that
should
be
obvious
enough
simply
from
the
date
of
the
materials
which
are
involved.
we
are
concerned
with
the
present
and
future
impact
of
the
publication
of
some
of
this
material
and
when
i
say
future,
i
don’t
mean
in
the
21st
century,
but
i
also
don't
mean
to
limit
it
to
tomorrow
because
in
this
area,
events
of
great
consequence
to
the
united
states
happen
over
periods
of
six
months,
a
year,
perhaps
two
or
three
years.
what
we
are
concerned
with
is
the
impact
on
the
present
and
the
reasonably
near
future
of
the
publication
of
these
events,
of
these
materials.
now
it
is
perfectly
true
that
prior
restraint
cases
with
respect
to
the
press
are
rare
or
conceivably
nonexistent.
i’m
not
ready
to
concede
that
they
are
nonexistent,
but
i
can’t
point
to
one
now.
i
hadn’t
had
time
to
make
a
really
thorough
research.
i
did
point
out
that
there
are
prior
restraint
cases
as
recently
as
last
term
with
respect
to
freedom
of
speech
which
is
the
first
amendment
in
exactly
the
same
terms
as
the
freedom
of
the
press.
and
there
is
the
associated
press
case
which
comes
about
as
close
to
being
a
prior
restraint
on
the
press
case
as
you
can
get
without
perhaps
being
technically
a
prior
restraint
case.
the
reason
of
course
that
there
are
not
prior
restraint
cases
with
respect
to
the
press
is
that
ordinarily
you
don’t
find
out
about
it
until
it’s
been
published.
reference
has
been
made
to
the
fact
oh!
there
are
leaks
all
the
time,
there
are
great
many
leaks,
but
i
would
point
out
that
there
is
also
a
very
widespread
respect
of
the
security
classification
system
and
its
potentiality
on
the
security
of
the
united
states.
senator
fulbright
did
not
publish
this
material.
he
sent
it
to
the
secretary
of
defense
or
requested
from
the
secretary
of
defense
of
what
use
he
could
make
of
it
and
i
have
seen
on
the
television
other
members
of
congress
who
said
that
they
had
some
of
the
material,
but
felt
not
appropriate
to
use
it
because
it
was
classified
top
secret.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it’s
hard
for
me
to
answer
the
question
in
such
broad
terms.
i
think
that
if
properly
classified
materials
are
improperly
acquired
and
that
it
can
be
shown
that
they
do
have
a
--
an
immediate
or
current
impact
on
the
security
of
the
united
states
that
there
ought
to
be
an
--
there
ought
to
be
an
injunction.
now
i
think
it
is
relevant
at
this
point
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that's
a
pejorative
way
to
put
it
mr.
justice.
i
don’t
know
what
the
alternative
is.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice
and
we
are
of
course
fully
supporting
the
first
amendment.
the
--
we
do
not
claim
or
suggest
any
exception
of
the
first
amendment
and
we
do
not
agree
with
mr.
glendon
when
he
says
that
we
set
aside
the
first
amendment
or
that
judge
gesell
or
the
two
courts
of
appeals
in
this
case
have
set
aside
the
first
amendment
by
issuing
the
injunction
which
they
have.
the
problem
in
this
case
is
the
construction
of
the
first
amendment.
now
mr.
justice
black,
your
construction
of
that
is
well
known
and
i
certainly
respect
it.
you
say
that
no
law
means
no
law
and
that
should
be
obvious.
and
i
can
only
say
mr.
justice
that
to
me,
it
is
equally
obvious
that
no
law
does
not
mean
no
law
and
i
would
seek
to
persuade
the
court
that
that
is
true.
as
chief
justice
marshall
said
so
long
ago,
it
is
a
constitution
we
are
interpreting
and
all
we
ask
for
here
is
the
construction
of
the
constitution
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
it
is
a
part
of
the
constitution
and
that
there
are
other
parts
of
the
constitution
which
grants
powers
and
responsibilities
to
the
executive.
and
that
the
first
amendment
was
not
intended
to
make
it
impossible
for
the
executive
to
function
or
to
protect
the
security
of
the
united
states.
now,
it’s
been
suggested
that
the
government
move
very
slowly
in
this
matter,
that
the
time
started
publishing
on
sunday.
well
actually
it
was
on
monday
which
is
pretty
fast
as
the
government
operates
in
terms
of
the
consultations
that
had
to
be
made.
the
policy
decisions
it
had
to
be
made.
on
monday,
the
attorney
general
sent
a
telegram
to
the
new
york
times,
asked
them
to
stop
and
to
return
the
documents.
the
new
york
times
refused
and
on
tuesday,
the
united
states
started
this
suit.
it’s
suggested
that
there
had
been
full
hearing,
everything
has
been
carefully
and
thoroughly
considered,
but
there
is
clear
evidence
of
haste
in
both
records
and
this
is
apparent
from
the
times
which
have
been
stated
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
even
now
at
this
point,
the
hearing
is
on
the
question
whether
a
preliminary
injunction
should
be
granted.
the
only
hearings
that
have
been
held
in
any
courts
are
as
to
whether
a
preliminary
injunction
should
be
granted.
they
were
no
intended
to
be
full
plenary
trials,
but
merely
sufficient
to
show
the
probability
of
possible
success.
there
is
simply
was
not
time
to
prepare
a
comprehensive
listing
or
a
comprehensive
array
of
expert
witnesses.
the
government
relied
on
the
fact
that
the
district
judge
would
examine
the
study
and
he
on
the
record,
concededly
refused
to
do
so.
this
was
at
the
heart
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
in
its
decision
to
remand
for
a
full
week
of
hearings
on
the
merits.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no.
that
there
had
not
been
a
full
hearing
with
respect
to
this
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i’m
talking
about
the
new
york
times,
this
case
is
in
the
second
circuit,
and
the
second
circuit
sent
it
back
to
the
judge
for
rehearing
with
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
the
contrary
mr.
justice,
the
full
47
volumes
were
offered
judge
gurfein
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
and
he
refused
to
examine.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice,
he
wouldn’t
examine
them.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
i
think
that
really
came
at
a
later
stage
in
that
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
they
sent
it
back
not
for
an
instant
hearing,
but
for
one
limited,
properly
so.
everything
about
this
case
has
been
fronted.
that
seems
to
me
to
be
the
most
unfortunate
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
new
york
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
a
very
serious
matter.
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
and
so
is
the
security
of
the
united
states
a
very
serious
matter
and
we
have
two
important
constitutional
objectives
here
which
have
to
be
weighed
and
balanced
and
made
as
harmonious
as
they
can
be.
but,
it
is
well
know
that
at
the
times
had
this
material
for
three
months.
it’s
only
after
the
times
has
had
an
opportunity
to
digest
it
and
it
took
them
three
months
to
digest
it,
that
it
became
necessary
to
be
frantic
about
it.
it
wasn’t
so
terribly
important
to
get
it
out
and
get
it
to
the
public
while
the
times
were
working
over
it,
but
after
that,
now
the
times
finds
it
extremely
difficult
to
except
an
opportunity
for
the
courts
to
have
an
adequate
chance
first
to
resolve
the
extremely
difficult
question
of
the
proper
construction
of
the
first
amendment
in
this
situation
and
i
can
see
that’s
an
extremely
difficult
question.
and
if
it
--
if
the
proper
construction
is
the
one
which
mr.
justice
black
has
taken
for
a
long
time
and
is
well
known,
of
course,
there’s
nothing
more
to
be
said,
but
our
contention
is
that
that
is
not
the
proper
construction.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
very
reluctantly,
they
were
pushed
into
conceding
that
there
might
be
some
cases
where
there
could
be
those
suggested
in
the
opinion
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
frankly
i
don’t
think
it’s
much
of
a
limitation
to
say
that
it
can
be
enjoined
if
it
will
result
in
a
break
of
diplomatic
relations
or
a
war
tomorrow
and
as
i
have
already
said,
we
think
the
standard
used
by
judge
gesell
is
wrong.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
i
think
--
i’m
sorry
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i’m
not
sure
what
standard
judge
gurfein
used.
judge
gesell,
because
much
of
this
material
judge
gurfein
did
not
have
specifically
called
to
his
attention.
the
standard
which
judge
gesell
used
is
to
say
that
unless
it
comes
within
that
illustrative
language
and
the
definition
of
top
secret
that
it
does
not
meet
the
requirement
and
i
contend
that
that
is
wrong.
i
believe
and
have
sought
to
show
in
the
closed
brief
which
is
filed
here
that
there
are
materials
and
there
are
items
in
this
material
which
will
affect
the
problem
of
the
termination
of
the
war
in
vietnam
which
will
affect
negotiations
such
as
the
salt
talks
which
affects
the
security
of
united
states
vitality
over
a
long
period
and
which
will
affect
the
problem
of
return
of
prisoners
of
war.
and
i
suggest
that,
however,
it
is
formulating,
the
standard
ought
to
be
one
which
will
make
it
possible
to
prevent
the
publication
of
materials
which
will
have
those
consequences.
