mr.
william
r.
glendon
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors,
general
griswold,
mr.
bickel,
i
think
it
might
be
helpful
if
i
address
my
attention
to
the
facts
which
lie
behind
these
cases
or
this
case,
the
washington
post
case
as
it
comes
before
your
honors.
because,
i
think
we
have
heard
here
a
familiar
plea,
familiar
to
what
has
been
involved
in
this
case
over
this
last
intense
week
that
some
more
time
is
needed
while
the
first
amendment
is
suspended.
we
first
face
this
question,
judge
gesell
did
some
week
ago
and
after
a
hearing
on
the
temporary
restraining
order,
unconvinced
by
the
generality
and
lack
of
specificity,
he
denied
the
temporary
restraining
order.
the
government
has
a
course
with
its
right
promptly
went
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
an
extraordinary
late
session,
everything
has
been
--
everything
has
been
late
i
may
say
in
this
case,
late
hours,
the
court
of
appeals
two
to
one
judges
rob
and
judge
robinson
granted
a
temporary
restraining
order
to
the
government
to
give
them
some
time
and
thus
for
the
second
time
in
two
weeks
and
the
second
time
in
200
years,
the
united
states
succeeded
in
obtaining
a
temp
--
prior
restraint
against
the
press.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
stated
--
the
court
of
appeals
stated
--
in
its
order
that
it
would
set
--
send
it
back,
send
it
to
the
district
court
and
the
district
court
would
try
it
to
determine
whether
the
granting
of
an
injunction
with
a
publication
of
material
would
so
prejudice
the
defense
interest
of
the
united
states
are
a
result
in
such
irreparable
injury
to
the
united
states
as
to
justify
the
extraordinary
relief
that
was
asked
to
it,
a
prior
restraint.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
yes
sir.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
i
think
that’s
a
proper
test
your
honor,
yes.
that’s
the
test
that
we
tried
the
case
under
and
i
think
the
implications
of
the
words
may
require
some
development
and
i’m
sure
there
will
be
arguments
as
to
exactly
what
those
words
mean.
but
that’s
the
test
we
tried
to
--
we
tried
the
case.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
so
prejudiced,
so
prejudiced
the
defense
interests
of
the
united
states
result
in
such
irreparable
injury
to
the
united
states
as
would
justify
restraining
the
publications.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
well,
your
honor
let’s
say,
that’s
a
hard
case,
obviously.
i’m
trying
and
i
think
we
all
have
to
measure
this
case
in
the
light
of
what
we
have
before
us
and
what
we
know
we
have
before
us.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
yes
and
i’m
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
i’m
going
to
address
myself
to
those,
your
honor,
and
i’m
going
to
point
out
as
the
best
i
can
within
the
limits
here
and
as
did
other
courts
and
the
government
has
not
yet
brought
anything
like
that
case
to
your
honors,
nothing
like
it
and
what
we
have
heard,
your
honor,
is
much
more
in
the
nature
of
conjecture
and
surmise.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
your
honor,
i
think
if
we
are
to
place
possibilities
or
conjecture
against
suspension
or
abridgment
of
the
first
amendment,
the
answer
is
obvious.
the
fact,
the
possibility
or
conjecture
of
the
hypothesis
that
diplomatic
negotiations
would
be
made
more
difficult
or
embarrassed,
does
not
justify
and
this
is
what
we
have
in
this
case
and
i
think
it's
all
we
know,
does
not
justify
suspending
the
first
amendment,
yet
this
is
what’s
happened
here.
conjecture
can
be
piled
upon
surmised,
judge
gurfein
used
the
word
(inaudible)
and
i’m
sure
used
it
respectfully.
but
he
said
when
there
is
a
security
breech,
people
get
the
juris.
and
i
think
as
the
--
maybe
the
government
has
a
case
of
the
juris
here,
but
that
i
submit
does
not
warrant
the
--
stopping
the
press
in
this
matter
in
the
absence
of
a
showing.
and
i
like
to
turn
to
that
because
this
matter
as
i
don’t
have
to
say,
does
not
come
undeveloped
before
your
honors.
two
fine
district
court
judges,
two
fine
court
of
appeals
have
considered
this
and
in
each
i
think
it’s
fair
to
say
even
in
the
new
york
case,
the
government
did
not
meet
its
burden.
and
so
it
says
to
us,
but
one
more
time,
just
one
more
time
and
this
is
where
i
was
a
moment
ago
when
i
said
that
judge
rob
and
judge
robinson
agreed
to
give
them
a
chance.
now
we
had
a
hearing
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
i
like
to,
if
i
may,
comment
upon
what
the
government
said
and
it
said
it
twice
about
that
hearing
because
really
your
honors
are
being
asked
to
--
on
a
representation
and
it's
a
i
know
a
sincere
representation
by
general
griswold,
but
on
a
representation
if
we
are
given
some
more
time,
maybe
we
can
find
something.
but
here
is
what
the
government
says
in
its
brief
and
it
said
it
again
yesterday.
they
said
in
new
york,
the
government
was
not
able
to
present
to
the
court
all
of
the
evidence
relating
to
the
impact
of
the
disclosure
of
this
material
upon
foreign
relations
and
national
defense
that
it
was
able
to
present
to
the
district
court
in
the
washington
post
case.
we
had
and
the
government
was
accorded
the
fullest
hearing
that
it
wanted.
we
had
--
we
started
at
the
unusual
hour
of
8:00
in
the
morning.
the
government’s
case
proceed
it
through
the
luncheon
hour.
we
cross
examined
as
we
thought
it
was
necessary.
the
court
had
plenty
of
time
to
consider
the
matter
he
delivered,
i
think
you
agree,
whether
you
agree
with
this
result,
a
finely
reasoned
opinion.
so
there
was
no
rush
and
no
pressure.
then
the
matter
went
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
there
and
the
court
of
appeals
had
a
session
some
three
hours
the
next
day.
and
i
might
say
too
and
i
think
this
is
perhaps
important,
there’s
been
no
restriction
on
the
government's
latitude
because
they
did
have
this
in-camera
hearings
which
frankly
was
very
difficult
from
our
point
of
view
to
deal
with.
but
they
did
have
them
and
they
had
it
in-camera
hearing
in
the
court
of
appeals.
so
to
say
now
that
we
need
more
time,
i
think
does
not
measured
up
to
the
other
side,
the
other
side
of
the
equation
which
you're
being
asked
to
do
and
that
is
to
restrain
two
newspapers
while
others
are
publishing
from
giving
their
readers
the
news.
and
it
is
of
course
their
readers
that
we
feel.
i
think
properly
their
rights
are
involved
too.
their
right
to
know
and
i’m
talking
about
currency
and
immediacy
there
is
now
involved
in
this
country,
the
country
is
on
gage
and
in
intense
national
debate.
things
are
happening
this
week
on
that
score.
these
lawsuits
undoubtedly
precipitated
the
executive
to
turn
over
these
documents
to
the
congress.
now
senator
fulbright
as
i’m
sure
you’re
all
aware
have
been
trying
for
some
two
years
i
understand
to
get
these
documents.
and
i
think
it’s
of
interest
here
because
we're
dealing
with
this
case
and
these
documents
and
i
think
classification
is
important
here
in
your
consideration
of
these
cases
because
these
documents
were
classified
top
secret.
now
they
were
classified
top
secret
because
some
unknown
individual
was
not
presented
to
the
court
whose
subjective
judgment
couldn’t
be
explored
despite
the
district
judge
asking
that
he’s
be
brought
in.
perhaps
it
was
a
good
reason,
we
don’t
know,
decided
that
they
were
top
secret,
they
were
all
top
secret
because
one
was
top
secret.
there
had
been
no
review
of
these
documents
except
for
a
one
individual
who
said
that
he
had
been
reviewing
them
for
some
two
years
for
sensitivity
and
the
sensitivity
arose
from
senator
fulbright's
frequent
request
to
get
these
documents
so
the
congress
could
make
the
laws
and
perhaps
the
public
would
be
informed.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
how
long
it
is
--
in
his
possession,
it
does
not
show
your
honor.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
the
record
in
our
case
does
not
show
that
your
honor,
but
i
have
read
and
perhaps
this
gentleman,
mr.
bickel
can
answer
that
and
i
understood
they
had
it
in
their
possession
for
some
months
or
month
or
two.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
yes.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
it
is
not
in
the
record,
but
that’s
my
best
answer
to
that.
now,
after
this
proceeding
was
brought
and
i
think
again
it
has
filed
the
significance
of
this
proceeding
and
during
the
course
of
it,
although
starting
out
at
the
point
that
these
documents
were
top
secret
and
none
could
be
disclosed,
the
government
has
offered
to
review
them
and
perhaps
some
of
them
they
say
will
be
declassified
which
i
suppose
are
some
sort
of
admission
that
the
original
classification
and
the
original
attitude
towards
them
was
wrong.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
that
is
correct,
your
honor
and
furthermore,
some
of
these
documents
were
classified,
go
back
of
course
to
1945,
the
documents
of
that
ancient.
the
document
itself
is
entitled
the
history,
it’s
called
the
history
and
from
what
i
have
seen
of
it,
that’s
what
it
is.
now,
the
court
in
our
case
had
before
it
and
your
honors
will
see
the
evidence
which
i’m
aware
that
apparently
has
been
--
there
has
been
today
additional
references
made
to
the
documents,
but
it
is
a
fact
and
i
think
it’s
a
significant
fact
that
the
judge
--
they
are
asked
the
government
to
show
them
a
document.
these
extravagant
claims
were
made
and
i
say
this
respectfully,
but,
this
has
been
a
case
of
broad
claims
and
narrow
proof.
substantial
claims
have
been
made
and
if
you
accept
them,
they
would
be
worried,
but
we’re
talking
here
about
proof.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
the
government
--
there
was
not
your
honor.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
the
government
made
such
a
request
and
because
of
the
concern
that
the
newspaper
has
as
to
protection
of
its
source,
the
documents
we
were
advised
would
indicate
the
source.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
that
the
documents
that
we
had
would
indicate
the
source.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
yes,
and
here
is
it
how
it
resulted.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
here
is
he
resolved
the
matter,
and
i
think
he
did
it
very
fairly
your
honor.
he
said
if
you
are
not
willing
to
produce
the
documents,
we
do
not
have
all
the
documents,
but
if
will
not
produce
all
the
documents
because
of
your
claim
of
first
amendment
source
protection
then
i
will
assume
that
you
have
all
the
documents.
and
therefore,
the
government
can
show
me
any
document,
show
me
any
document
and
i
will
accept
that
as
being
in
your
possession
for
the
purpose
of
the
case.
and
i
think
that
was
a
very
--
in
the
circumstances,
a
very
fair
way
to
do
it.
i
---
no
more
than
any
other
lawyer
like
to
be
in
that
position,
but
i
have
to
respect
my
client’s
assertion
which
is
a
substantial
and
i
think
a
valid
assertion
that
a
newspaper
is
entitled
to
protect
its
source
and
so
that’s
the
way
it
was.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
your
honor,
i
don’t
understand
that
that
is
the
issue
here.
i
think
--
i
don’t
know
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
this
is
only
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
we
did
not
come
into
equity.
the
government
came
into
equity
but
i
don’t
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
we
were
brought
in
kicking
and
screaming,
i
guess
is
--[laughter]
mr.
william
r.
glendon
i
see
no
conflict,
your
honor,
i
see
no
conflict
at
all.
we're
in
the
position
of
asking
that
there
not
be
a
prior
restraint
in
violation
of
the
constitution
imposed
on
us
and
that
equity
should
no
do
that.
we
are
also
in
the
position
of
saying
that
under
the
first
amendment,
we
are
entitled
to
protect
our
sources,
and
i
find
--
frankly
i
just
don’t
find
any
conflict
anywhere
your
honor.
the
record
shows,
and
i
think
this
is
important
in
your
honor's
consideration
too,
we
are,
as
i
said,
talking
about
--
we
are
talking
about
allegedly
top
secret
documents
and
the
record
shows
that
these
misnomers
are
of
the
secret
and
top
secret,
on
and
perhaps
in
the
breech
in
washington
and
the
way
the
government
does
business
and
the
way
it
has
perhaps
to
do
business,
but
it
is
certainly
true,
there
is
massive,
all
the
classification
of
documents
in
washington,
we
have
in
the
record
instances
where
one
government
official
or
another
has
quite
clearly
indicated
that
while
everything
on
his
desk
maybe
classified
in
one
fashion
or
another,
in
fact
perhaps
1%,
2%,
5%
of
it
really
is
classified
and
i
think
that’s
a
realistic
fact
of
life
here.
we
also
have
clearly
in
the
record
that
the
government
and
the
press
who
have
some
mutual,
perhaps
antagonism
isn’t
quiet
the
word
but
they
are
naturally
in
opposite
corners.
the
press
is
trying
to
get
as
much
news
as
it
can.
the
government
particularly
where
it
maybe
embarrassing
or
where
it
maybe
overly
concerned
or
may
feel
is
embarrassing
or
may
in
judge
gurfein's
words
have
the
jurors
is
trying
to
prevent
that
sometimes.
in
other
occasions,
the
government
engages
itself
in
leaks
because
some
official
will
feel
that
in
the
public
interest,
it's
well
for
the
public
to
know
and
that
overrides
any
particular
judgment
of
our
security
or
classification.
and
the
record
your
honors
will
find
as
replete
with
instances
where
leaks
of
confidential
secret,
top
secret
material
have
been
given
to
the
press
or
the
press
have
found
them
out
and
published
them
and
of
course
nothing
has
happened.
now,
i
think
that’s
significant
because
here,
this
is
sort
of
thing
we
feel
we're
talking
about.
as
far
as
classification
itself
is
concerned
and
you
will
remember
that
the
documents
that
we
are
talking
about
are
a
mixed
bag,
they
have
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
i
don’t
think
that
the
source,
i
don’t
think
that
how
we
acquired
on
your
honor
features
in
this
case
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
i
think
it’s
relevant
as
background
because
this
is
not
--
this
is
the
way
that
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
i
think
so.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
i
just
don’t
think
that
the
--
i
don’t
think
that
the
manner
in
which
we
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
well,
your
honor
i
think
if
you
examine
the
--
that’s
certainly
not
true.
that's
certainly
not
customarily
and
the
size
here
is
different.
but
i
think
that
you
will
find
your
honors
in
the
affidavits
that
we
have
attached
to,
and
exhibits
that
we
have
attached
to
our
affidavits
indicating
secret
stories,
allegedly
secret,
based
on
the
secret
information.
there’s
probably
more
secret
information
there
then
you
will
find
them
into
these
documents
if
you
examine
them.
i
started
to
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
i
think
it’s
simply
a
matter
of
background
your
honor
and
atmosphere
to
show
that
this
is
not
an
untoward
or
unknown
situation
and
when
we
hear
about
how
our
foreign
allies
or
our
foreign
friends
will
be
shocked
or
appalled
or
anything
else,
it’s
something
not
so.
this
is
--
this
happens.
this
is
one
of
the
facts
of
life.
i
tried
to
–
i
was
starting
to
advert
to
the
district
judge
telling
the
government
to
show
it
which
is
what
he
was
supposed
to
do.
that’s
what
the
court
of
appeals
sent
it
back
for
and
he
requested
to
show
these
documents,
these
top
secret
documents,
they
were
in
the
courtroom
and
the
government
was
invited
and
it
has
been
invited
to
show
and
let’s
look
at
what
we’re
talking
about
instead
of
dealing
just
with
abstractions
and
conjectures.
now,
this
was
on
the
so
called
secret
transcript
and
i’m
not
going
to
avert
to
it
other
than
to
say
that
the
one
document
that
the
government
produced
in
response
to
this
invitation
was
set
forth,
certain
options
with
reference
to
the
war
and
i
won’t
go
any
further
than
that,
which
i
think
any
high
school
boy
would
have
no
difficulty
in
either
putting
together
himself
or
readily
understanding.
all
of
them
are
on
the
public
press.
now
this
is
a
sort
of
proof
we've
been
faced
with
and
this
is
the
world
of
whisk
that
we’ve
been
chasing.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
well
your
honors
--
your
honor,
that
is
true.
i’d
like
to
avert
to
fact
that
the
other
members
of
the
court
of
appeals
felt
constrained
after
they
read
that
particular
dissent.
just
yesterday
they
issued
an
amendment
to
their
opinion
in
which
they
reiterated
that
they
disagreed
with
judge
mckinnon
–
judge
wilkey,
which
to
me
was
some
indication
of
the
strength
and
depth
of
their
feeling,
but
your
honor
is
right.
there
is
a
judge
wilkey
felt
and
i
said
to
your
honor
that
that
in
my
--
i
say
it
respectfully
is
not
based
on
the
record.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
i
know
off
that
would
and
--
i
think
i
know
the
record,
as
far
as
the
one
disclose
to
me
there
are
some
perhaps
new
material
this
morning.
is
not
--
but
as
far
as
the
record
has
been
disclosed
to
me,
there
is
absolutely
nothing
to
justify
that
statement
and
i
--
as
i
say
the
court
of
appeals
felt
strong
enough
about
it
to
issue
another
statement,
to
issue
an
amendment
in
which
they
specifically
said
they
disagree.
now
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
well
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
largely
--
yes.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
i
--
they
have
shown
nothing
of
that
kind
or
by
any
other
measurable
standard
that
i
understand
could
possibly
be
involved
in
this
case.
would
you
take
the
top
--?
mr.
william
r.
glendon
--
take
the
top
secret
definitions
or
anything
else,
yes,
but
there
is
something
behind
us
too
as
i
--
which
i
think
perhaps
is
illegal
issue
and
that’s
the
scope
of
the
review
here.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
review
of
the
findings
of
the
district
court.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
that’s
right.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
yes
and
there
is
one
legal
question,
perhaps
i’ll
come
later
and
that
is
the
futility
of
an
injunction
here,
but
i
want
to
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
no
sir.
i
assert
this
your
honor
and
i’m
involved
in
the
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
any
other
standard
i’m
talking
about.
i
don’t
--
i
think
that
the
standard
is
reasonably
clear
here,
but
whether
you
use
words
such
as
gravely
prejudice
to
united
states
or
irreparably
injure
the
defense
of
the
united
states,
whatever
the
standard
maybe.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
yes.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
yes
sir.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
clearly.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
by
anything
the
government
has
brought
forward.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
well
your
honor,
the
government
came
in
the
court.
they
suspended
the
first
amendment.
they
stopped
us
from
printing
and
they
said
they
were
going
to
prove
this
and
this
is
an
injunction
proceeding.
now,
it
may
be
that
the
government
would
feel
that
the
court
should
become
the
defense
department's
security
officer
and
they
should
--
that
the
court
should
delve
into
this
pile
of
paper
and
47
volumes
and
on
its
own
from
time
to
time
whenever
they
so
moved.
the
government
is
so
moved
that
they
should
--
the
courts
should
look
from
them.
i
say
your
honor,
in
our
system,
as
i
understand
it,
when
you
bring
a
case;
you’re
supposed
to
prove
it
and
when
you
come
in
claiming
irreparable
injury,
particularly
in
this
area
of
the
first
amendment,
you
have
a
very,
very
heavy
burden.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
yes,
i
think
that’s
--
that
that
would
appear
from
his
opinion.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
he
looked
at
it
that
way
from
his
opinion,
yes
your
honor.
as
far
as
i
can
determine
from
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
yes,
i
think
that
that
fits
in
clearly
to
what
we're
talking
about
under
the
doctrine
of
near
v.
minnesota,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
your
honor
i’m
sorry
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
we’ll,
i
think
that
clearly
as
i
--
clearly
erroneous
rule
would
apply
to
the
facts,
what
facts
he
found
in
that
points,
your
honor.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
well
i
fell
that
he
used
the
right
standard.
your
honors
will
determine
that
here
and
i
think
that
as
far
as
the
law
is
concerned
that
that
is
substantially
the
standard
whether
you
can
perhaps
use
alternative
words,
but
the
thing
is
i
think
is
immediacy
and
currency,
current
injury
to
the
united
states
as
this
court
has
--
and
so
substantial
that
it
justifies
what’s
been
done
here.
i
mean,
it
isn’t
just
that
the
united
states
has
been
injured.
judge
gesell
made
a
point
which
i
think
is
a
very
good
one
that
i
think
perhaps
the
government
may
forget
that
the
interest
of
the
united
states
is
the
people's
interest.
and
you
are
weighing
here
and
this
is
why
i
suppose
we
are
here,
you
are
weighing
here
an
abridgement
of
the
first
amendment
to
people’s
right
to
know
and
that
may
be
an
obstruction
of
--
but
it’s
a
one
that’s
kept
this
country
and
made
it
great
for
some
200
years
and
you’re
being
asked
to
approve
something
that
the
government
has
never
done
before.
we
were
told
by
the
attorney
general
to
stop
publishing
this
news.
we
didn’t
obey
that
order
and
we
are
brought
into
court
and
we
are
ended
up
being
enjoined.
and
i
try
--
i
do
think
that
when
you
come
to
that
balance
in
face
of
the
proof,
in
face
of
the
proof
that
exists
here
that
decision
is
quiet
clear
that
the
first
amendment
must
survive
because
they
haven’t
made
out
a
case.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
i
think
essentially
that
that
justice
harlan.
i’m
not
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
yes
that’s
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
they
weren’t
reviewing;
they
were
making
an
original
determination.
there
wasn’t
--
your
honor
the
circumstances
and
the
proof
before
them,
it
was
not
the
kind
of
injury,
the
irreparable
injury
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
it
was
a
de
novo
hearing.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
no,
it
featured
in
the
evidence
your
honor
as
to
how
the
classification
got
put
on
because
that
of
course
is
the
bedrock
in
their
case.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
no,
because
the
government
says
and
you
must
listen,
they
say,
it’s
top
secret
and
that’s
it.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
well
that’s
my
understanding
of
the
whole
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
well
it’s
the
argument
we’ve
heard
along
that
--
and
you
see
that
having
classified
a
top
secret,
they
move
from
there
to
show
no
proof.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
i
was
trying
to
say
that
having
classified
the
documents
top
secret.
that’s
the
premise
to
their
case.
they
have
not
yet
come
in
to
this
court
and
proven
they
are
top
secret
and
yet
they
say
we
can’t
publish
them
because
they
are
top
secret,
isn’t
it?
mr.
william
r.
glendon
i
did
not
make
that
argument,
your
honor.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
no
i
do
not
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
no
your
honor
i
do
not
say
that.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
never.
i
do
not
say
it.
no
sir.
i
say
we
--
we
stand
your
honor
if
i
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
no
sir,
we
stand
squarely
and
exclusively
on
the
first
amendment.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors,
general
griswold,
mr.
bickel,
i
think
it
might
be
helpful
if
i
address
my
attention
to
the
facts
which
lie
behind
these
cases
or
this
case,
the
washington
post
case
as
it
comes
before
your
honors.
because,
i
think
we
have
heard
here
a
familiar
plea,
familiar
to
what
has
been
involved
in
this
case
over
this
last
intense
week
that
some
more
time
is
needed
while
the
first
amendment
is
suspended.
we
first
face
this
question,
judge
gesell
did
some
week
ago
and
after
a
hearing
on
the
temporary
restraining
order,
unconvinced
by
the
generality
and
lack
of
specificity,
he
denied
the
temporary
restraining
order.
the
government
has
a
course
with
its
right
promptly
went
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
an
extraordinary
late
session,
everything
has
been
--
everything
has
been
late
i
may
say
in
this
case,
late
hours,
the
court
of
appeals
two
to
one
judges
rob
and
judge
robinson
granted
a
temporary
restraining
order
to
the
government
to
give
them
some
time
and
thus
for
the
second
time
in
two
weeks
and
the
second
time
in
200
years,
the
united
states
succeeded
in
obtaining
a
temp
--
prior
restraint
against
the
press.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
stated
--
the
court
of
appeals
stated
--
in
its
order
that
it
would
set
--
send
it
back,
send
it
to
the
district
court
and
the
district
court
would
try
it
to
determine
whether
the
granting
of
an
injunction
with
a
publication
of
material
would
so
prejudice
the
defense
interest
of
the
united
states
are
a
result
in
such
irreparable
injury
to
the
united
states
as
to
justify
the
extraordinary
relief
that
was
asked
to
it,
a
prior
restraint.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
yes
sir.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
i
think
that’s
a
proper
test
your
honor,
yes.
that’s
the
test
that
we
tried
the
case
under
and
i
think
the
implications
of
the
words
may
require
some
development
and
i’m
sure
there
will
be
arguments
as
to
exactly
what
those
words
mean.
but
that’s
the
test
we
tried
to
--
we
tried
the
case.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
so
prejudiced,
so
prejudiced
the
defense
interests
of
the
united
states
result
in
such
irreparable
injury
to
the
united
states
as
would
justify
restraining
the
publications.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
well,
your
honor
let’s
say,
that’s
a
hard
case,
obviously.
i’m
trying
and
i
think
we
all
have
to
measure
this
case
in
the
light
of
what
we
have
before
us
and
what
we
know
we
have
before
us.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
yes
and
i’m
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
i’m
going
to
address
myself
to
those,
your
honor,
and
i’m
going
to
point
out
as
the
best
i
can
within
the
limits
here
and
as
did
other
courts
and
the
government
has
not
yet
brought
anything
like
that
case
to
your
honors,
nothing
like
it
and
what
we
have
heard,
your
honor,
is
much
more
in
the
nature
of
conjecture
and
surmise.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
your
honor,
i
think
if
we
are
to
place
possibilities
or
conjecture
against
suspension
or
abridgment
of
the
first
amendment,
the
answer
is
obvious.
the
fact,
the
possibility
or
conjecture
of
the
hypothesis
that
diplomatic
negotiations
would
be
made
more
difficult
or
embarrassed,
does
not
justify
and
this
is
what
we
have
in
this
case
and
i
think
it's
all
we
know,
does
not
justify
suspending
the
first
amendment,
yet
this
is
what’s
happened
here.
conjecture
can
be
piled
upon
surmised,
judge
gurfein
used
the
word
(inaudible)
and
i’m
sure
used
it
respectfully.
but
he
said
when
there
is
a
security
breech,
people
get
the
juris.
and
i
think
as
the
--
maybe
the
government
has
a
case
of
the
juris
here,
but
that
i
submit
does
not
warrant
the
--
stopping
the
press
in
this
matter
in
the
absence
of
a
showing.
and
i
like
to
turn
to
that
because
this
matter
as
i
don’t
have
to
say,
does
not
come
undeveloped
before
your
honors.
two
fine
district
court
judges,
two
fine
court
of
appeals
have
considered
this
and
in
each
i
think
it’s
fair
to
say
even
in
the
new
york
case,
the
government
did
not
meet
its
burden.
and
so
it
says
to
us,
but
one
more
time,
just
one
more
time
and
this
is
where
i
was
a
moment
ago
when
i
said
that
judge
rob
and
judge
robinson
agreed
to
give
them
a
chance.
now
we
had
a
hearing
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
i
like
to,
if
i
may,
comment
upon
what
the
government
said
and
it
said
it
twice
about
that
hearing
because
really
your
honors
are
being
asked
to
--
on
a
representation
and
it's
a
i
know
a
sincere
representation
by
general
griswold,
but
on
a
representation
if
we
are
given
some
more
time,
maybe
we
can
find
something.
but
here
is
what
the
government
says
in
its
brief
and
it
said
it
again
yesterday.
they
said
in
new
york,
the
government
was
not
able
to
present
to
the
court
all
of
the
evidence
relating
to
the
impact
of
the
disclosure
of
this
material
upon
foreign
relations
and
national
defense
that
it
was
able
to
present
to
the
district
court
in
the
washington
post
case.
we
had
and
the
government
was
accorded
the
fullest
hearing
that
it
wanted.
we
had
--
we
started
at
the
unusual
hour
of
8:00
in
the
morning.
the
government’s
case
proceed
it
through
the
luncheon
hour.
we
cross
examined
as
we
thought
it
was
necessary.
the
court
had
plenty
of
time
to
consider
the
matter
he
delivered,
i
think
you
agree,
whether
you
agree
with
this
result,
a
finely
reasoned
opinion.
so
there
was
no
rush
and
no
pressure.
then
the
matter
went
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
there
and
the
court
of
appeals
had
a
session
some
three
hours
the
next
day.
and
i
might
say
too
and
i
think
this
is
perhaps
important,
there’s
been
no
restriction
on
the
government's
latitude
because
they
did
have
this
in-camera
hearings
which
frankly
was
very
difficult
from
our
point
of
view
to
deal
with.
but
they
did
have
them
and
they
had
it
in-camera
hearing
in
the
court
of
appeals.
so
to
say
now
that
we
need
more
time,
i
think
does
not
measured
up
to
the
other
side,
the
other
side
of
the
equation
which
you're
being
asked
to
do
and
that
is
to
restrain
two
newspapers
while
others
are
publishing
from
giving
their
readers
the
news.
and
it
is
of
course
their
readers
that
we
feel.
i
think
properly
their
rights
are
involved
too.
their
right
to
know
and
i’m
talking
about
currency
and
immediacy
there
is
now
involved
in
this
country,
the
country
is
on
gage
and
in
intense
national
debate.
things
are
happening
this
week
on
that
score.
these
lawsuits
undoubtedly
precipitated
the
executive
to
turn
over
these
documents
to
the
congress.
now
senator
fulbright
as
i’m
sure
you’re
all
aware
have
been
trying
for
some
two
years
i
understand
to
get
these
documents.
and
i
think
it’s
of
interest
here
because
we're
dealing
with
this
case
and
these
documents
and
i
think
classification
is
important
here
in
your
consideration
of
these
cases
because
these
documents
were
classified
top
secret.
now
they
were
classified
top
secret
because
some
unknown
individual
was
not
presented
to
the
court
whose
subjective
judgment
couldn’t
be
explored
despite
the
district
judge
asking
that
he’s
be
brought
in.
perhaps
it
was
a
good
reason,
we
don’t
know,
decided
that
they
were
top
secret,
they
were
all
top
secret
because
one
was
top
secret.
there
had
been
no
review
of
these
documents
except
for
a
one
individual
who
said
that
he
had
been
reviewing
them
for
some
two
years
for
sensitivity
and
the
sensitivity
arose
from
senator
fulbright's
frequent
request
to
get
these
documents
so
the
congress
could
make
the
laws
and
perhaps
the
public
would
be
informed.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
how
long
it
is
--
in
his
possession,
it
does
not
show
your
honor.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
the
record
in
our
case
does
not
show
that
your
honor,
but
i
have
read
and
perhaps
this
gentleman,
mr.
bickel
can
answer
that
and
i
understood
they
had
it
in
their
possession
for
some
months
or
month
or
two.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
yes.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
it
is
not
in
the
record,
but
that’s
my
best
answer
to
that.
now,
after
this
proceeding
was
brought
and
i
think
again
it
has
filed
the
significance
of
this
proceeding
and
during
the
course
of
it,
although
starting
out
at
the
point
that
these
documents
were
top
secret
and
none
could
be
disclosed,
the
government
has
offered
to
review
them
and
perhaps
some
of
them
they
say
will
be
declassified
which
i
suppose
are
some
sort
of
admission
that
the
original
classification
and
the
original
attitude
towards
them
was
wrong.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
that
is
correct,
your
honor
and
furthermore,
some
of
these
documents
were
classified,
go
back
of
course
to
1945,
the
documents
of
that
ancient.
the
document
itself
is
entitled
the
history,
it’s
called
the
history
and
from
what
i
have
seen
of
it,
that’s
what
it
is.
now,
the
court
in
our
case
had
before
it
and
your
honors
will
see
the
evidence
which
i’m
aware
that
apparently
has
been
--
there
has
been
today
additional
references
made
to
the
documents,
but
it
is
a
fact
and
i
think
it’s
a
significant
fact
that
the
judge
--
they
are
asked
the
government
to
show
them
a
document.
these
extravagant
claims
were
made
and
i
say
this
respectfully,
but,
this
has
been
a
case
of
broad
claims
and
narrow
proof.
substantial
claims
have
been
made
and
if
you
accept
them,
they
would
be
worried,
but
we’re
talking
here
about
proof.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
the
government
--
there
was
not
your
honor.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
the
government
made
such
a
request
and
because
of
the
concern
that
the
newspaper
has
as
to
protection
of
its
source,
the
documents
we
were
advised
would
indicate
the
source.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
that
the
documents
that
we
had
would
indicate
the
source.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
yes,
and
here
is
it
how
it
resulted.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
here
is
he
resolved
the
matter,
and
i
think
he
did
it
very
fairly
your
honor.
he
said
if
you
are
not
willing
to
produce
the
documents,
we
do
not
have
all
the
documents,
but
if
will
not
produce
all
the
documents
because
of
your
claim
of
first
amendment
source
protection
then
i
will
assume
that
you
have
all
the
documents.
and
therefore,
the
government
can
show
me
any
document,
show
me
any
document
and
i
will
accept
that
as
being
in
your
possession
for
the
purpose
of
the
case.
and
i
think
that
was
a
very
--
in
the
circumstances,
a
very
fair
way
to
do
it.
i
---
no
more
than
any
other
lawyer
like
to
be
in
that
position,
but
i
have
to
respect
my
client’s
assertion
which
is
a
substantial
and
i
think
a
valid
assertion
that
a
newspaper
is
entitled
to
protect
its
source
and
so
that’s
the
way
it
was.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
your
honor,
i
don’t
understand
that
that
is
the
issue
here.
i
think
--
i
don’t
know
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
this
is
only
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
we
did
not
come
into
equity.
the
government
came
into
equity
but
i
don’t
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
we
were
brought
in
kicking
and
screaming,
i
guess
is
--[laughter]
mr.
william
r.
glendon
i
see
no
conflict,
your
honor,
i
see
no
conflict
at
all.
we're
in
the
position
of
asking
that
there
not
be
a
prior
restraint
in
violation
of
the
constitution
imposed
on
us
and
that
equity
should
no
do
that.
we
are
also
in
the
position
of
saying
that
under
the
first
amendment,
we
are
entitled
to
protect
our
sources,
and
i
find
--
frankly
i
just
don’t
find
any
conflict
anywhere
your
honor.
the
record
shows,
and
i
think
this
is
important
in
your
honor's
consideration
too,
we
are,
as
i
said,
talking
about
--
we
are
talking
about
allegedly
top
secret
documents
and
the
record
shows
that
these
misnomers
are
of
the
secret
and
top
secret,
on
and
perhaps
in
the
breech
in
washington
and
the
way
the
government
does
business
and
the
way
it
has
perhaps
to
do
business,
but
it
is
certainly
true,
there
is
massive,
all
the
classification
of
documents
in
washington,
we
have
in
the
record
instances
where
one
government
official
or
another
has
quite
clearly
indicated
that
while
everything
on
his
desk
maybe
classified
in
one
fashion
or
another,
in
fact
perhaps
1%,
2%,
5%
of
it
really
is
classified
and
i
think
that’s
a
realistic
fact
of
life
here.
we
also
have
clearly
in
the
record
that
the
government
and
the
press
who
have
some
mutual,
perhaps
antagonism
isn’t
quiet
the
word
but
they
are
naturally
in
opposite
corners.
the
press
is
trying
to
get
as
much
news
as
it
can.
the
government
particularly
where
it
maybe
embarrassing
or
where
it
maybe
overly
concerned
or
may
feel
is
embarrassing
or
may
in
judge
gurfein's
words
have
the
jurors
is
trying
to
prevent
that
sometimes.
in
other
occasions,
the
government
engages
itself
in
leaks
because
some
official
will
feel
that
in
the
public
interest,
it's
well
for
the
public
to
know
and
that
overrides
any
particular
judgment
of
our
security
or
classification.
and
the
record
your
honors
will
find
as
replete
with
instances
where
leaks
of
confidential
secret,
top
secret
material
have
been
given
to
the
press
or
the
press
have
found
them
out
and
published
them
and
of
course
nothing
has
happened.
now,
i
think
that’s
significant
because
here,
this
is
sort
of
thing
we
feel
we're
talking
about.
as
far
as
classification
itself
is
concerned
and
you
will
remember
that
the
documents
that
we
are
talking
about
are
a
mixed
bag,
they
have
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
i
don’t
think
that
the
source,
i
don’t
think
that
how
we
acquired
on
your
honor
features
in
this
case
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
i
think
it’s
relevant
as
background
because
this
is
not
--
this
is
the
way
that
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
i
think
so.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
i
just
don’t
think
that
the
--
i
don’t
think
that
the
manner
in
which
we
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
well,
your
honor
i
think
if
you
examine
the
--
that’s
certainly
not
true.
that's
certainly
not
customarily
and
the
size
here
is
different.
but
i
think
that
you
will
find
your
honors
in
the
affidavits
that
we
have
attached
to,
and
exhibits
that
we
have
attached
to
our
affidavits
indicating
secret
stories,
allegedly
secret,
based
on
the
secret
information.
there’s
probably
more
secret
information
there
then
you
will
find
them
into
these
documents
if
you
examine
them.
i
started
to
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
i
think
it’s
simply
a
matter
of
background
your
honor
and
atmosphere
to
show
that
this
is
not
an
untoward
or
unknown
situation
and
when
we
hear
about
how
our
foreign
allies
or
our
foreign
friends
will
be
shocked
or
appalled
or
anything
else,
it’s
something
not
so.
this
is
--
this
happens.
this
is
one
of
the
facts
of
life.
i
tried
to
–
i
was
starting
to
advert
to
the
district
judge
telling
the
government
to
show
it
which
is
what
he
was
supposed
to
do.
that’s
what
the
court
of
appeals
sent
it
back
for
and
he
requested
to
show
these
documents,
these
top
secret
documents,
they
were
in
the
courtroom
and
the
government
was
invited
and
it
has
been
invited
to
show
and
let’s
look
at
what
we’re
talking
about
instead
of
dealing
just
with
abstractions
and
conjectures.
now,
this
was
on
the
so
called
secret
transcript
and
i’m
not
going
to
avert
to
it
other
than
to
say
that
the
one
document
that
the
government
produced
in
response
to
this
invitation
was
set
forth,
certain
options
with
reference
to
the
war
and
i
won’t
go
any
further
than
that,
which
i
think
any
high
school
boy
would
have
no
difficulty
in
either
putting
together
himself
or
readily
understanding.
all
of
them
are
on
the
public
press.
now
this
is
a
sort
of
proof
we've
been
faced
with
and
this
is
the
world
of
whisk
that
we’ve
been
chasing.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
well
your
honors
--
your
honor,
that
is
true.
i’d
like
to
avert
to
fact
that
the
other
members
of
the
court
of
appeals
felt
constrained
after
they
read
that
particular
dissent.
just
yesterday
they
issued
an
amendment
to
their
opinion
in
which
they
reiterated
that
they
disagreed
with
judge
mckinnon
–
judge
wilkey,
which
to
me
was
some
indication
of
the
strength
and
depth
of
their
feeling,
but
your
honor
is
right.
there
is
a
judge
wilkey
felt
and
i
said
to
your
honor
that
that
in
my
--
i
say
it
respectfully
is
not
based
on
the
record.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
i
know
off
that
would
and
--
i
think
i
know
the
record,
as
far
as
the
one
disclose
to
me
there
are
some
perhaps
new
material
this
morning.
is
not
--
but
as
far
as
the
record
has
been
disclosed
to
me,
there
is
absolutely
nothing
to
justify
that
statement
and
i
--
as
i
say
the
court
of
appeals
felt
strong
enough
about
it
to
issue
another
statement,
to
issue
an
amendment
in
which
they
specifically
said
they
disagree.
now
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
well
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
largely
--
yes.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
i
--
they
have
shown
nothing
of
that
kind
or
by
any
other
measurable
standard
that
i
understand
could
possibly
be
involved
in
this
case.
would
you
take
the
top
--?
mr.
william
r.
glendon
--
take
the
top
secret
definitions
or
anything
else,
yes,
but
there
is
something
behind
us
too
as
i
--
which
i
think
perhaps
is
illegal
issue
and
that’s
the
scope
of
the
review
here.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
review
of
the
findings
of
the
district
court.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
that’s
right.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
yes
and
there
is
one
legal
question,
perhaps
i’ll
come
later
and
that
is
the
futility
of
an
injunction
here,
but
i
want
to
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
no
sir.
i
assert
this
your
honor
and
i’m
involved
in
the
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
any
other
standard
i’m
talking
about.
i
don’t
--
i
think
that
the
standard
is
reasonably
clear
here,
but
whether
you
use
words
such
as
gravely
prejudice
to
united
states
or
irreparably
injure
the
defense
of
the
united
states,
whatever
the
standard
maybe.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
yes.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
yes
sir.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
clearly.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
by
anything
the
government
has
brought
forward.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
well
your
honor,
the
government
came
in
the
court.
they
suspended
the
first
amendment.
they
stopped
us
from
printing
and
they
said
they
were
going
to
prove
this
and
this
is
an
injunction
proceeding.
now,
it
may
be
that
the
government
would
feel
that
the
court
should
become
the
defense
department's
security
officer
and
they
should
--
that
the
court
should
delve
into
this
pile
of
paper
and
47
volumes
and
on
its
own
from
time
to
time
whenever
they
so
moved.
the
government
is
so
moved
that
they
should
--
the
courts
should
look
from
them.
i
say
your
honor,
in
our
system,
as
i
understand
it,
when
you
bring
a
case;
you’re
supposed
to
prove
it
and
when
you
come
in
claiming
irreparable
injury,
particularly
in
this
area
of
the
first
amendment,
you
have
a
very,
very
heavy
burden.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
yes,
i
think
that’s
--
that
that
would
appear
from
his
opinion.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
he
looked
at
it
that
way
from
his
opinion,
yes
your
honor.
as
far
as
i
can
determine
from
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
yes,
i
think
that
that
fits
in
clearly
to
what
we're
talking
about
under
the
doctrine
of
near
v.
minnesota,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
your
honor
i’m
sorry
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
we’ll,
i
think
that
clearly
as
i
--
clearly
erroneous
rule
would
apply
to
the
facts,
what
facts
he
found
in
that
points,
your
honor.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
well
i
fell
that
he
used
the
right
standard.
your
honors
will
determine
that
here
and
i
think
that
as
far
as
the
law
is
concerned
that
that
is
substantially
the
standard
whether
you
can
perhaps
use
alternative
words,
but
the
thing
is
i
think
is
immediacy
and
currency,
current
injury
to
the
united
states
as
this
court
has
--
and
so
substantial
that
it
justifies
what’s
been
done
here.
i
mean,
it
isn’t
just
that
the
united
states
has
been
injured.
judge
gesell
made
a
point
which
i
think
is
a
very
good
one
that
i
think
perhaps
the
government
may
forget
that
the
interest
of
the
united
states
is
the
people's
interest.
and
you
are
weighing
here
and
this
is
why
i
suppose
we
are
here,
you
are
weighing
here
an
abridgement
of
the
first
amendment
to
people’s
right
to
know
and
that
may
be
an
obstruction
of
--
but
it’s
a
one
that’s
kept
this
country
and
made
it
great
for
some
200
years
and
you’re
being
asked
to
approve
something
that
the
government
has
never
done
before.
we
were
told
by
the
attorney
general
to
stop
publishing
this
news.
we
didn’t
obey
that
order
and
we
are
brought
into
court
and
we
are
ended
up
being
enjoined.
and
i
try
--
i
do
think
that
when
you
come
to
that
balance
in
face
of
the
proof,
in
face
of
the
proof
that
exists
here
that
decision
is
quiet
clear
that
the
first
amendment
must
survive
because
they
haven’t
made
out
a
case.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
i
think
essentially
that
that
justice
harlan.
i’m
not
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
yes
that’s
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
they
weren’t
reviewing;
they
were
making
an
original
determination.
there
wasn’t
--
your
honor
the
circumstances
and
the
proof
before
them,
it
was
not
the
kind
of
injury,
the
irreparable
injury
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
it
was
a
de
novo
hearing.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
no,
it
featured
in
the
evidence
your
honor
as
to
how
the
classification
got
put
on
because
that
of
course
is
the
bedrock
in
their
case.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
no,
because
the
government
says
and
you
must
listen,
they
say,
it’s
top
secret
and
that’s
it.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
well
that’s
my
understanding
of
the
whole
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
well
it’s
the
argument
we’ve
heard
along
that
--
and
you
see
that
having
classified
a
top
secret,
they
move
from
there
to
show
no
proof.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
i
was
trying
to
say
that
having
classified
the
documents
top
secret.
that’s
the
premise
to
their
case.
they
have
not
yet
come
in
to
this
court
and
proven
they
are
top
secret
and
yet
they
say
we
can’t
publish
them
because
they
are
top
secret,
isn’t
it?
mr.
william
r.
glendon
i
did
not
make
that
argument,
your
honor.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
no
i
do
not
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
no
your
honor
i
do
not
say
that.
mr.
william
r.
glendon
never.
i
do
not
say
it.
no
sir.
i
say
we
--
we
stand
your
honor
if
i
--
mr.
william
r.
glendon
no
sir,
we
stand
squarely
and
exclusively
on
the
first
amendment.
