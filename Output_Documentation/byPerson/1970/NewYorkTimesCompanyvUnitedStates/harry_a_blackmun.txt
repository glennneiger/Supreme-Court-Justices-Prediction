mr.
solicitor
general,
one
detail
in
that
connection.
is
there
anything
in
the
record
or
any
information
anywhere
that
the
possession
by
the
other
newspapers
is
attributable
to
the
new
york
times
or
to
the
washington
post?
justice
harry
a.

have
either
of
these
newspapers
denied
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
the
possession
on
the
part
of
the
other
newspapers
is
not
attributable
to
them.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
bickel,
this
isn’t
your
case,
but
reading
from
judge
wilkey’s
dissent
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
when
i
say
harm,
i
mean
the
death
of
soldiers,
the
destruction
of
alliances,
the
greatly
increased
difficulty
of
negotiation
with
our
enemies.
the
inability
of
our
diplomats
and
negotiators,
honest
brokers
between
would
be
belligerence.
i
take
it
you
disagree
fundamentally
with
that
statement?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
know
these
records
better
than
i
do,
but
again
going
back
to
judge
wilkey,
he
says,
“but
on
careful
detailed
study
of
the
affidavits
and
evidence,
i
find
a
number
of
examples
of
documents
which
if
in
possession
of
a
post
and
i
repeat
this
is
the
post
case,
and
if
published
would
clearly
result
in
great
harm
to
the
nation.
now
i
repeat
my
question,
you
therefore
disagree
fundamentally
to
what
he
seems
to
say?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
mr.
glendon,
then
i
come
back
to
you
with
the
same
inquiry
i
made
to
professor
bickel.
at
least,
it
was
close
enough
to
persuade
one
judge
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
disagree
with
what
you’ve
just
said?
