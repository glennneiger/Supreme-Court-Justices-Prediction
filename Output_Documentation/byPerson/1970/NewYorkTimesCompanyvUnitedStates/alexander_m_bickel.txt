mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
begin
publishing
on
june
13.
we
published
on
the
14
and
the
15
with
no
move
from
the
government
till
the
evening
of
the
14
despite
what
is
now
said
to
be
the
gravest
kind
of
danger
which
one
would
have
supposed
would
have
been
more
obvious
then
it
turned
out
to
be.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
i
planned
to
return
briefly
to
this
point.
i
point
out
now
only
that
as
was
evident
to
us
at
the
hearings
when
we
cross
examined
some
of
government
witnesses,
high
ranking
people
in
the
government
quite
evidently
read
these
things
on
sunday
morning,
the
following
day
and
no
great
alarm
sounded.
i
meant
to
return
to
the
significance
of
this
point
if
i
could
see
it,
i
mentioned
it
by
the
way
now
only
in
the
process
of
reciting
the
chronology.
we
were
then
enjoined
under
prior
restraint
on
the
15
and
we
have
been
under
injunction
ever
since,
the
11th
i
guess
under
the
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
second
circuit.
we
would
remain
under
injunction
presumably
to
the
july
3
with
the
distinct
possibility
of
more
time
added
after
that
if
appellate
proceedings
are
required.
now
a
word
simply
on
what
was
had
before
the
hearing
that
was
had
before
judge
gurfein.
it
took
place
on
friday
last
i
believe,
started
first
thing
in
the
morning
with
open
hearings.
we
went
in-camera
as
mr.
seymour
said
for
something
upward
of
four
hours,
i
don’t
know
the
exact
time.
the
record
will
clearly
show
that
the
judges’
sole
purpose
in-camera
and
continuously
expressed
intent
was
to
provoke
from
the
government
witnesses
something
specific
to
achieve
from
them
the
degree
of
guidance
that
he
felt
he
needed
in
order
to
penetrate
this
enormous
record.
it
is
our
judgment
and
it
was
his
that
he
got
very
little
perhaps
almost
nothing.
the
point
however
that
i
wish
to
leave
with
you
is
that
at
no
time
in
the
course
of
these
hearings,
did
the
government
object
to
their,
what
is
now
called
the
speed
or
rapidity
of
them,
at
not
point
it
was
more
time
as
for.
of
course
we
all
labored
as
i
think
is
only
proper
under
the
knowledge
that
a
great
newspaper
was
being
restrained
from
publishing
and
that
expedition
was
desirable.
but
there
is
no
evidence
that
i
know
off
that
judge
gurfein
rushed
the
proceedings
or
would
have
rushed
them
if
the
government
had
asked
for
more
time.
i
think
the
government
gave
judge
gurfein
all
it
had.
now
the
government
based
it’s
complaints
against
us
framed
in
very
general
terms
on
a
statute.
first
one
section
of
it,
finally
section
793
(e)
of
the
statute.
we
have
a
substantial
portion
of
our
brief
that
is
still
devoted
to
arguing
that
that
statute
is
inapplicable.
judge
gurfein
so
held
it
to
be
and
i
take
it
that
the
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
is
at
least
open
to
the
interpretation
that
that
holding
of
judge
gurfein's
is
not
affirmed
at
any
rate
accept
it.
if
i
may
at
this
point
take
up
mr.
justice
stewart’s
question
to
the
solicitor
general,
referring
to
our
position.
we
concede,
we
have
all
along
in
this
case
conceded
for
purposes
of
the
argument,
that
the
prohibition
against
prior
restraint
like
(inaudible)
constitution
is
not
an
absolute.
but
beyond
that
mr.
justice,
our
position
is
a
little
more
complicated
than
that.
nor
do
we
really
think
that
the
case
even
with
the
statute
out
of
it
is
a
simple,
presents
indeed
a
simple
question
of
fact.
rather,
our
position
is
two-fold.
first
on
principles
as
we
view
them
with
the
separation
of
powers
which
we
believe
denied
the
existence
of
inherent
presidential
authority
on
which
an
injunction
can
be
based.
first
on
those
and
secondly
on
first
amendment
principles
which
are
interconnected
on
both
the
end
which
involved
the
question
of
a
standard
before
one
reaches
the
facts,
it’s
a
standard
on
which
we
deeper
greatly
from
the
solicitor
general,
on
both
these
grounds,
we
believe
that
the
only
proper
resolution
of
the
case
is
the
dismissal
of
complaint.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
the
first
ground
which
i
am
about
to
enter
upon
is
the
question
of
the
separation
of
powers
with
the
statute
out
of
this
case.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
as
i
conceive
it
mr.
justice,
the
only
basis
on
which
the
injunction
can
issue
is
a
theory
which
i
think
the
solicitor
general
holds
of
an
inherent
presidential
power.
now
an
inherent
presidential
--
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
his
constitutional
--
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
i
so
assume.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
i
so
assume.
the
reason
for
that
being
that
a
court
has
to
find
its
law
somewhere,
as
holmes
would
have
said
i
suppose
of
--
some
legislative
will
must
be
present
from
which
the
court
draws
the
law
that
it
can
apply.
then
that
legislative
will
has
to
be
the
president's,
if
there
is
no
statute.
now,
i
don’t
for
a
moment
argue
that
the
president
doesn’t
have
full
inherent
power
to
establish
a
system
of
classification.
that
he
doesn’t
have
the
fullest
inherent
power
to
administer
that
system
and
its
procedures
within
the
executive
branch
he
has
his
means
of
guarding
security
at
the
source.
in
some
measure,
he
is
aided
by
the
criminal
sanction,
but
anyway
he
has
full
inherent
power
and
the
scope
of
judicial
review
of
the
exercise
of
that
power
will
presumably
vary
with
the
case
in
which
it
comes
up,
but
i’m
prepared
to
concede
the
decision
in
the
epstein
(ph)
for
example
which
is
cited
i
think
in
both
briefs.
briefs
that
under
the
freedom
of
information
act,
the
scope
of
review
is
limited,
limited
to
examining
whether
it
is
(inaudible).
nor
do
i
argue
the
--
that
the
president
doesn’t
have
standing
in
the
sense
in
which
baker
and
karr
distinguishes
between
standing
and
justiceability.
standing
to
come
into
court
which
is
i
think
the
burden
of
most
of
the
cases
that
the
government
cites.
the
question
that
i
do
argue
is
whether
there
is
inherent
presidential
power
to
make
substantive
law
not
for
the
internal
government
of
--
internal
management
of
the
government,
but
out
going
--
out
looking
substantive
law
which
can
form
the
basis
for
a
judicially
issued
injunction
imposing
a
prior
restraint
on
speech.
the
decisive
issue
that
ties
in
at
this
point
and
our
ultimate
first
amendment
point
is
of
course
the
exception
carved
out
by
chief
justice
hughes
in
near
v.
minnesota
for
those
--
that
narrow
area
in
which
he
accepted
that
a
prior
restraint
on
speech
might
be
applied.
this
is
an
exception
that
is
made
to
a
rule
more
solidly
entrenched
in
the
first
amendment
and
any
other
aspects
of
it
or
rule
that
is
deeply
part
of
the
formative
experience
out
of
which
the
first
amendment
came,
the
rule
against
the
prior
restraint,
based
on
the
experience
that
prior
restraints
fall
on
speech
with
a
special
brutality
and
finality
and
procedural
ease
of
all
their
own
which
distinguishes
them
from
other
regulations
of
speech.
if
a
criminal
statute
chose
speech,
a
prior
restraint
freezes
it.
it’s
within
that
well
established
doctrine
that
the
exception
arises.
now,
as
chief
justice
hughes
formulated
it,
it
referred
to,
he
actually
said,
“we
would
all
assume
that
a
prior
restraint
might
be
possible
to
prevent
actual
obstruction
of
the
recruiting
service,
this
is
the
chief
justice
language,
or
the
publication
of
sailing
dates
of
transports
or
the
number
and
location
of
troops.”
i
suppose
that
under
present
law,
the
recruiting
service
part
of
that
exception
is
problematic,
but
on
the
sailing
dates
of
ships
and
the
location
of
troops,
there
is
a
very
specific
statute.
it
is
18
u.s.c.
794
which
isn't
cited
--
hasn’t
been
cited
against
us
which
again
applicable
which
is
why
it
hasn’t
been
cited
against
us
because
that’s
not
what
we
report,
that’s
not
--
that
isn’t
in
our
papers.
now,
that
being
the
case,
there
is
no
applicable
statute
under
which
we
are
covered
and
the
question
arises
as
a
matter
of
inherent
presidential
authority,
what
kind
of
feared
event
would
give
rise
to
an
independent
power
on
the
part
of
the
president?
it’s
the
question
of
in
a
sense
that
was
saved
in
hirabayashi
versus
united
states,
the
first
of
the
japanese
exclusion
cases.
and
it’s
a
question
which
in
its
own
context
of
course,
youngstown
sheet
&
tube
company
v.
sawyer
answered
in
the
negative.
now,
my
suggestion
would
be
that
whatever
that
case,
that
extremity,
absolute
other
extremity
in
which
action
to
save
for
the
public
safely
is
required.
whatever
that
case
maybe
in
which
under
this
constitution
under
its
rules
of
separation
of
powers,
the
president
has
independent
inherent
authority
to
act
domestically
against
citizens,
let
alone
to
impose
a
prior
restraint,
whatever
that
case
maybe,
it
cannot
be
this
case.
whatever
that
case
maybe,
it
sure
is
a
magnitude
of
an
obviousness
that
would
lead
to
the
eye
and
that’s
why
in
part
mr.
chief
justice,
i
mentioned
at
the
beginning
the
period
of
time
that
has
passed.
i
would
suppose
that
stretching
our
imagination
and
trying
to
envision
that
case,
the
one
characteristic
of
it,
suggested
indeed
by
the
example
of
chief
justice
hughes
recited,
suggested
by
the
phrase
that
the
second
circuit
used
which
is
probably
why
the
solicitor
general
resists
the
word
immediate.
the
single
characteristic
that
we
can
surely,
immediately
see
of
such
an
imagined
event,
would
be
that
it’s
obvious,
that
the
public
safety
is
in
issue,
the
time
of
the
essence.
i
submit
that
that
cannot
be
this
case.
it
cannot
be
that
it
has
taken,
that
it
has
to
take
the
government
which
has
been
reviewing
this
documents
for
many
months,
not
just
in
connection
with
this
case
but
in
reply
to
an
inquiry
made
by
senator
fulbright
is
the
record
of
our
hearings
in
new
york
shows,
it
cannot
be
that
a
government
consisting
after
all
of
more
than
just
the
three
witnesses,
five
witness
that
we
heard
in
new
york
or
the
ones
that
were
heard
here,
over
this
length
of
time
has
an
unfamiliar
--
unfamiliarity
with
these
documents,
substantially
they
might
be
which
is
so
great
that
when
news
of
their
publication
comes
up,
no
body
in
the
government
knows
that
somewhere
in
those
documents
is
one
which
presents
a
mortal
danger
to
the
security
of
the
united
states.
and
i
would
submit
secondly
that
while
error
is
always
possible,
judge
griffin
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
which
affirmed
them
on
the
record
that
he
had
before
him
and
judge
gesell
in
the
court
of
appeals
here,
all
those
judges
can't
have
been
that
wrong.
this
--
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
yes
sir.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
not
entirely,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
for
example
the
death
of
soldiers.
i
would
disagree
that
that
impairment
of
diplomatic
relations
can
be
a
case
for
a
prior
restraint,
i
would
say
even
under
a
statute.
i
would
not
disagree
that
the
death
of
soldiers
as
in
troop
ship
or
as
an
example,
chief
justice
hughes
did.
the
difficulty
i
would
have
would
be
that
nothing
that
any
of
these
judges
including
judge
wilkey
because
he
i
suppose
is
talking
about
what
might
be
shown
by
the
government,
nothing
that
any
of
these
judges
have
seen
is
related
by
a
direct
casual
change
to
the
death
of
soldiers
or
anything
grave
of
that
sort.
what
characterizes,
i
have
heard
it
and
everything
i
have
read,
what
characterizes
every
instance
in
which
the
government
tries
to
make
its
case
factually
is
a
chain
of
causation
whose
lengths
are
surmised
and
speculation,
all
going
toward
some
distant
event
itself,
not
of
the
gravity
that
i
would
suggest
is
offensive.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
well,
i
beg
your
pardon
mr.
justice,
i
am
not
familiar
and
i
should
be
with
the
washington
post
case.
i
had
thought
that
judge
wilkey
talked
about
--
dissented
on
the
ground
that
he
would
like
more
evidence
to
come
in.
if
he
found
--
if
this
is
a
statement
about
the
evidence
that
he
heard
or
that
was
heard
before
judge
gesell
then
depending
on
what
the
standard
is
that
he
has
in
mind,
i
would
think
that
language
doesn’t
quite
communicate
to
me
what
the
standard
is
and
i
doubt
that
it’s
the
standard
that
i
would
contend,
the
narrow
standard
that
i
would
contend
for,
depending
on
the
standard
that
he
has
in
mind,
he
is
either
wrong
about
a
standard
or
seven
judges
disagreed
with
him,
but
i’m
sorry.
i’m
not
sufficient
familiar
with
the
washington
post
case.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
the
standard
--
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
the
standard
that
i
would
contend
for
and
the
difficulties
of
words
are
simply
enormous,
one
has
to
--
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
--
bring
in
to
those
mind
an
image
of
something,
some
event
and
try
to
describe
it.
the
standard
that
i
would
contend
for
would
have
two
parts
of
it.
one
would
be
and
let
me
also
say
that
i
would
differentiate
between
a
standard
applicable
to
the
president
acting
on
his
own.
the
president
acting
in
the
case
saved
pre
se
hirabayashi
for
example
and
a
prior
restraint
being
imposed
pursuant
to
a
well
drawn
statute
which
defines
the
standard
in
the
case.
i
would
demand
less
of
the
statute
than
i
would
demand
to
the
president.
but
the
standard
in
general
that
i
would
have
in
mind
would
at
one
end
have
a
great
event,
a
danger
to
the
nation.
some
of
the
things
described
in
the
top
secret,
in
description
of
top
secret
classification
in
the
executive
order,
solicitor
general
read
off,
would
i
think
fit
that
end
of
the
standard.
at
the
other
end
would
be
the
fact
of
publication
and
i
would
demand
and
this
would
be
my
second
element
that
the
chain,
the
length
between
the
fact
of
publication
and
the
feared
danger,
the
feared
event
be
direct
and
immediate
and
visible.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
that
would
be
chiefly
for
the
reason
that
as
is
notorious.
classifications
are
imposed
--
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
which
are
properly.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
that’s
correct,
mr.
justice.
i
would
say
that
parts
of
--
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
that
there
is
no
--
well,
no.
i
don’t
know
about
--
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
i
have
no
knowledge.
i’ve
never
been
near
the
documents
mr.
justice.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
i
would
say
that
today
i
had,
if
asked
that
question
on
the
day
we
appeared,
at
the
day
i
appeared
before
judge
gurfein
on
a
temporary
restraining
order,
my
answer
would
have
been,
i
expect
not,
i
trust
the
people
at
times.
i
--
i’m
fairly
certain
not,
by
now,
mr.
justice
after
all
this
time
having
read
the
submissions
of
the
government
although
i
was
hit
with
another
one
this
morning,
not
a
separate
submission,
but
an
explication
of
the
earlier
ones
but
i
haven’t
had
a
chance
to
glance
at,
yet
this
literature
like
some
scholarly
literature
tends
to
get
ahead
of
us.
having
read
the
submissions
of
the
government,
i
am
flatly
persuaded
that
there’s
nothing
in
there
because
if
there’s
nothing
that
would
meet
my
standard
in
there
for
a
statute
or
for
a
independent
executive
action
because
if
there
were,
it
surely
should
have
timed
out
by
now.
it
cannot
be
that
after
i
gather,
the
solicitor
general
had
the
same
experience
yesterday
afternoon
that
i
saw
judge
gurfein
have
it.
please
show
me?
now
which
are
the
three,
which
are
the
five,
which
are
the
ten?
which
are
the
most
important
of
these?
all
that
one
ever
got,
all
that
i’ve
ever
heard
have
been
statements
of
the
feared
events
in
terms
of
effect
on
diplomatic
relations.
if
it’s
a
military
matter,
why
then
in
terms
of
the
addition
of
a
possible
cause
to
a
train
causal
factor,
to
a
train
of
event
that’s
well
on
the
rails
as
is
and
propelled
by
sufficient
other
factors.
that
sort
of
statement
is
the
only
thing
we’ve
heard
and
i
would
submit
that
that
does
not
meet
any
possible
first
amendment
standard.
it
doesn’t
meet
it
either
in
the
statement
of
the
seriousness
of
the
event
that’s
feared
or
what
is
more
important
and
more
obvious
in
this
case
in
the
drawing
of
the
link
between
the
act
of
publication
as
the
cause
of
that
event
and
the
event
that
is
feared.
that
link
is
always
i
suggest
speculative,
full
of
surmises
and
a
chain
of
causation
that
after
its
first
one
or
two
links,
gets
involved
with
other
causes
operating
in
the
same
areas,
so
it
becomes
--
so
that
what
finally
cause
of
the
ultimate
event
becomes
impossible
to
say
which
the
effective
cause
was.
and
my
--
the
standard
that
i
would
propose
under
the
first
amendment
would
not
be
satisfied
by
such
showing.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
that’s
exactly
correct.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
yes,
i
was
addressing
myself
only
to
the
events
--
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
i
would
insist
that
for
purposes
certainly
of
any
action
in
the
president’s
inherent
power
which
is
the
case
before
us.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
yes
sir.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
mr.
justice,
i
wish
there
were
a
statute
that
covered
it.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
i’m
addressing
a
case
which
i
am
as
confident
as
i
can
be
of
anything,
your
honor,
will
not
find
when
you
get
back
to
your
chambers.
it’s
a
hard
case.
i
think
it
would
make
bad
separation
of
powers,
but
it’s
almost
impossible
to
resist
the
inclination
not
to
let
that
information
be
published
of
course.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
you
are
posing
or
--
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
your
opposing
the
case
of
course
mr.
justice
in
which
that
element
of
my
attempted
definition
which
refers
to
the
chain
of
causation.
i
mean,
--
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
no
--
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
no
sir.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
no
sir,
but
i
meant
--
it’s
a
case
in
which
the
chain
of
causation
between
the
act
of
publication
and
the
feared
event,
the
death
of
this
hundred
young
man
is
obvious,
direct,
immediate.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
that’s
right.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
i
only
say
as
to
that
that
it
is
a
case
in
which
in
the
absence
of
a
statute,
i
suppose
most
of
us
would
say
--
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
no.
i’m
afraid
i
have
--
i’m
afraid
my
--
the
inclinations
of
humanity
overcome
the
somewhat
more
abstract
devotion
to
the
first
amendment
in
a
case
to
that
sort.
i
would
wish
that
congress
took
a
look
to
the
seldom
used
and
at
the
seldom
used
and
not
very
--
in
not
a
very
good
shape
espionage
act
and
clean
them
up
so
that
we
could
have
statutes
that
are
clearly
applicable
within
vagueness
rules
and
what
not
and
so
that
we
that
we
don’t
have
to
rely
on
presidential
power.
but
the
burden
of
the
question
is
do
i
assume
that
the
event
has
to
be
of
cosmic
--
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
well,
no
sir.
the
examples
given
by
chief
justice
hughes
himself
are
not.
a
troop
ship
is
in
the
sense
that
hundred
men
or
the
location
of
a
platoon
is
in
the
sense
that
hundred
men.
i
don’t
assume
that.
i
have
--
i
do
honestly
think
that
that
hard
case
would
make
very
bad
separation
of
powers.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
mr.
chief
justice,
on
that
question
which
is
of
course
a
good
deal
nearer
to
what’s
bruited
about
anyway
in
the
record
of
this
case.
i
can
only
say
that
unless
which
i
can
imagine
can
be
possible,
the
link
of
causation
is
made
direct
and
immediate.
whether
the
--
even
though
the
event
might
be
somewhat
--
somewhat
distant,
but
unless
it
can
be
demonstrated
that
it
is
really
true
if
you
publish
this,
that
will
happen
or
there
is
a
high
probability
rather
than
as
is
typical
of
those
events.
there
are
17
causes
feeding
into
them.
three
of
those
are
--
anyone
of
those
other
than
the
publication
is
entirely
capable
of
being
the
single
effective
cause.
and
the
real
argument
is,
well
you
add
publication
to
that
and
it
makes
it
a
little
more
difficult.
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
that
that
is
a
risk
that
the
first
amendment
signifies
that
this
society
is
willing
to
take,
that
is
part
of
the
risk
of
freedom
that
i
would
certainly
take.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
mr.
chief
--
i’m
sorry.
what
--
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
mr.
chief
justice
that
there
--
i
think
it
--
i’m
perfectly
clear
in
my
mind
that
the
president
without
statutory
authority,
no
statutory
basis
goes
into
court
asks
for
an
injunction
on
that
basis,
that
if
youngstown
sheet
&
tube
company
v.
sawyer
means
anything,
he
does
not
get
it.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
now
--
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
where
under
a
statute,
we
don’t
face
it
in
this
case
and
i
really
don’t
know.
i’d
have
to
face
that
if
i
saw
it.
if
i
saw
the
statute,
if
i
saw
how
definite
it
was.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
well
--
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
no
sir.
only
in
that
i
have
conceded
for
purposes
of
this
argument
that
some
limitation,
some
impairment
of
the
absoluteness
of
that
prohibition
is
possible
and
i
argue
that
whatever
that
maybe,
whatever
that
maybe
it
is
surely
at
its
very
least
when
the
president
acts
without
statutory
authority
because
that
inserts
into
it
as
well
as
separation
of
powers.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
well,
i
didn’t
really
argue
that
mr.
justice.
at
least
i
have
--
i
hope
--
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
well,
i
replied
to
the
chief
justice
on
a
case
that
arose
without
a
statute
and
far
distinguished
because
its
crucial
to
the
--
for
purposes
of
this
case
to
distinguish
between
the
authority
which
is
here
claimed
of
the
president
to
act
independently
without
a
statute
and
the
possibly
greater
authority
of
the
whole
government
through
the
machinery
of
legislation
to
act
in
similar
premises
of
which
i
concede
nothing
that
i
don’t
have
to
mr.
justice.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
well,
there
are
some
cases
that
are
on
this
court’s
docket
as
you
know
mr.
chief
justice
for
next
fall.
one
of
them
with
which
i’m
most
familiar
is
the
caldwell
case
from
california
in
which
there
was
a
refusal
to
reveal
sources
upheld
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
even
to
the
point
of
not
requiring
an
appearance
before
the
grand
jury.
but
the
claim
is
very
substantially
qualified,
that
is
to
say
caldwell
holds,
one
doesn’t
know
how
far
that
might
be
taken
and
perhaps
some
of
the
other
cases
will
require
the
argument
to
take
it
somewhat
farther,
but
caldwell
on
its
own
holds
that
in
circumstances
where
the
government,
as
indeed
attorney
general
mitchell’s
regulations
themselves
provided,
which
are
issued
after
the
caldwell
case
started.
in
cases
where
the
government
hasn’t
shown
a
clear
necessity
for
the
evidence,
hasn’t
shown
that
it
hasn’t
been
able
to
get
it
elsewhere,
hasn’t
show
that
it’s
central,
inescapably
central
to
the
proof
of
whatever
crime
it
is
that
the
grand
jury
is
investigating
that
in
those
circumstances
where
the
claim
of
confidential
communication
is
made
by
the
reporter,
there
is
a
sufficient
first
amendment
interest
to
protect
that
claim
on
the
theory
that
if
confidential
sources
dry
up
and
they
--
the
theory
runs
would
dry
up
because
there
were
no
protection
of
confidentiality,
there
would
be
a
diminished
flow
of
news.
i
know
that
--
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
mr.
chief
justice,
i
know
there
is
an
appearance
of
unfairness
or
unevenness
about
it,
but
i
think
the
answer
that
a
reporter
would
make
and
an
answer
that
i
find
wholly
persuasive
is
that
neither
in
this
case
nor
in
a
case
like
caldwell
does
the
new
york
times
or
does
a
reporter
claim
something
for
himself,
but
rather
that
the
claim
is
made
in
order
to
vindicate
the
first
amendment
and
those
interests
which
that
great
document
serves.
thank
you.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
begin
publishing
on
june
13.
we
published
on
the
14
and
the
15
with
no
move
from
the
government
till
the
evening
of
the
14
despite
what
is
now
said
to
be
the
gravest
kind
of
danger
which
one
would
have
supposed
would
have
been
more
obvious
then
it
turned
out
to
be.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
i
planned
to
return
briefly
to
this
point.
i
point
out
now
only
that
as
was
evident
to
us
at
the
hearings
when
we
cross
examined
some
of
government
witnesses,
high
ranking
people
in
the
government
quite
evidently
read
these
things
on
sunday
morning,
the
following
day
and
no
great
alarm
sounded.
i
meant
to
return
to
the
significance
of
this
point
if
i
could
see
it,
i
mentioned
it
by
the
way
now
only
in
the
process
of
reciting
the
chronology.
we
were
then
enjoined
under
prior
restraint
on
the
15
and
we
have
been
under
injunction
ever
since,
the
11th
i
guess
under
the
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
second
circuit.
we
would
remain
under
injunction
presumably
to
the
july
3
with
the
distinct
possibility
of
more
time
added
after
that
if
appellate
proceedings
are
required.
now
a
word
simply
on
what
was
had
before
the
hearing
that
was
had
before
judge
gurfein.
it
took
place
on
friday
last
i
believe,
started
first
thing
in
the
morning
with
open
hearings.
we
went
in-camera
as
mr.
seymour
said
for
something
upward
of
four
hours,
i
don’t
know
the
exact
time.
the
record
will
clearly
show
that
the
judges’
sole
purpose
in-camera
and
continuously
expressed
intent
was
to
provoke
from
the
government
witnesses
something
specific
to
achieve
from
them
the
degree
of
guidance
that
he
felt
he
needed
in
order
to
penetrate
this
enormous
record.
it
is
our
judgment
and
it
was
his
that
he
got
very
little
perhaps
almost
nothing.
the
point
however
that
i
wish
to
leave
with
you
is
that
at
no
time
in
the
course
of
these
hearings,
did
the
government
object
to
their,
what
is
now
called
the
speed
or
rapidity
of
them,
at
not
point
it
was
more
time
as
for.
of
course
we
all
labored
as
i
think
is
only
proper
under
the
knowledge
that
a
great
newspaper
was
being
restrained
from
publishing
and
that
expedition
was
desirable.
but
there
is
no
evidence
that
i
know
off
that
judge
gurfein
rushed
the
proceedings
or
would
have
rushed
them
if
the
government
had
asked
for
more
time.
i
think
the
government
gave
judge
gurfein
all
it
had.
now
the
government
based
it’s
complaints
against
us
framed
in
very
general
terms
on
a
statute.
first
one
section
of
it,
finally
section
793
(e)
of
the
statute.
we
have
a
substantial
portion
of
our
brief
that
is
still
devoted
to
arguing
that
that
statute
is
inapplicable.
judge
gurfein
so
held
it
to
be
and
i
take
it
that
the
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
is
at
least
open
to
the
interpretation
that
that
holding
of
judge
gurfein's
is
not
affirmed
at
any
rate
accept
it.
if
i
may
at
this
point
take
up
mr.
justice
stewart’s
question
to
the
solicitor
general,
referring
to
our
position.
we
concede,
we
have
all
along
in
this
case
conceded
for
purposes
of
the
argument,
that
the
prohibition
against
prior
restraint
like
(inaudible)
constitution
is
not
an
absolute.
but
beyond
that
mr.
justice,
our
position
is
a
little
more
complicated
than
that.
nor
do
we
really
think
that
the
case
even
with
the
statute
out
of
it
is
a
simple,
presents
indeed
a
simple
question
of
fact.
rather,
our
position
is
two-fold.
first
on
principles
as
we
view
them
with
the
separation
of
powers
which
we
believe
denied
the
existence
of
inherent
presidential
authority
on
which
an
injunction
can
be
based.
first
on
those
and
secondly
on
first
amendment
principles
which
are
interconnected
on
both
the
end
which
involved
the
question
of
a
standard
before
one
reaches
the
facts,
it’s
a
standard
on
which
we
deeper
greatly
from
the
solicitor
general,
on
both
these
grounds,
we
believe
that
the
only
proper
resolution
of
the
case
is
the
dismissal
of
complaint.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
the
first
ground
which
i
am
about
to
enter
upon
is
the
question
of
the
separation
of
powers
with
the
statute
out
of
this
case.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
as
i
conceive
it
mr.
justice,
the
only
basis
on
which
the
injunction
can
issue
is
a
theory
which
i
think
the
solicitor
general
holds
of
an
inherent
presidential
power.
now
an
inherent
presidential
--
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
his
constitutional
--
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
i
so
assume.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
i
so
assume.
the
reason
for
that
being
that
a
court
has
to
find
its
law
somewhere,
as
holmes
would
have
said
i
suppose
of
--
some
legislative
will
must
be
present
from
which
the
court
draws
the
law
that
it
can
apply.
then
that
legislative
will
has
to
be
the
president's,
if
there
is
no
statute.
now,
i
don’t
for
a
moment
argue
that
the
president
doesn’t
have
full
inherent
power
to
establish
a
system
of
classification.
that
he
doesn’t
have
the
fullest
inherent
power
to
administer
that
system
and
its
procedures
within
the
executive
branch
he
has
his
means
of
guarding
security
at
the
source.
in
some
measure,
he
is
aided
by
the
criminal
sanction,
but
anyway
he
has
full
inherent
power
and
the
scope
of
judicial
review
of
the
exercise
of
that
power
will
presumably
vary
with
the
case
in
which
it
comes
up,
but
i’m
prepared
to
concede
the
decision
in
the
epstein
(ph)
for
example
which
is
cited
i
think
in
both
briefs.
briefs
that
under
the
freedom
of
information
act,
the
scope
of
review
is
limited,
limited
to
examining
whether
it
is
(inaudible).
nor
do
i
argue
the
--
that
the
president
doesn’t
have
standing
in
the
sense
in
which
baker
and
karr
distinguishes
between
standing
and
justiceability.
standing
to
come
into
court
which
is
i
think
the
burden
of
most
of
the
cases
that
the
government
cites.
the
question
that
i
do
argue
is
whether
there
is
inherent
presidential
power
to
make
substantive
law
not
for
the
internal
government
of
--
internal
management
of
the
government,
but
out
going
--
out
looking
substantive
law
which
can
form
the
basis
for
a
judicially
issued
injunction
imposing
a
prior
restraint
on
speech.
the
decisive
issue
that
ties
in
at
this
point
and
our
ultimate
first
amendment
point
is
of
course
the
exception
carved
out
by
chief
justice
hughes
in
near
v.
minnesota
for
those
--
that
narrow
area
in
which
he
accepted
that
a
prior
restraint
on
speech
might
be
applied.
this
is
an
exception
that
is
made
to
a
rule
more
solidly
entrenched
in
the
first
amendment
and
any
other
aspects
of
it
or
rule
that
is
deeply
part
of
the
formative
experience
out
of
which
the
first
amendment
came,
the
rule
against
the
prior
restraint,
based
on
the
experience
that
prior
restraints
fall
on
speech
with
a
special
brutality
and
finality
and
procedural
ease
of
all
their
own
which
distinguishes
them
from
other
regulations
of
speech.
if
a
criminal
statute
chose
speech,
a
prior
restraint
freezes
it.
it’s
within
that
well
established
doctrine
that
the
exception
arises.
now,
as
chief
justice
hughes
formulated
it,
it
referred
to,
he
actually
said,
“we
would
all
assume
that
a
prior
restraint
might
be
possible
to
prevent
actual
obstruction
of
the
recruiting
service,
this
is
the
chief
justice
language,
or
the
publication
of
sailing
dates
of
transports
or
the
number
and
location
of
troops.”
i
suppose
that
under
present
law,
the
recruiting
service
part
of
that
exception
is
problematic,
but
on
the
sailing
dates
of
ships
and
the
location
of
troops,
there
is
a
very
specific
statute.
it
is
18
u.s.c.
794
which
isn't
cited
--
hasn’t
been
cited
against
us
which
again
applicable
which
is
why
it
hasn’t
been
cited
against
us
because
that’s
not
what
we
report,
that’s
not
--
that
isn’t
in
our
papers.
now,
that
being
the
case,
there
is
no
applicable
statute
under
which
we
are
covered
and
the
question
arises
as
a
matter
of
inherent
presidential
authority,
what
kind
of
feared
event
would
give
rise
to
an
independent
power
on
the
part
of
the
president?
it’s
the
question
of
in
a
sense
that
was
saved
in
hirabayashi
versus
united
states,
the
first
of
the
japanese
exclusion
cases.
and
it’s
a
question
which
in
its
own
context
of
course,
youngstown
sheet
&
tube
company
v.
sawyer
answered
in
the
negative.
now,
my
suggestion
would
be
that
whatever
that
case,
that
extremity,
absolute
other
extremity
in
which
action
to
save
for
the
public
safely
is
required.
whatever
that
case
maybe
in
which
under
this
constitution
under
its
rules
of
separation
of
powers,
the
president
has
independent
inherent
authority
to
act
domestically
against
citizens,
let
alone
to
impose
a
prior
restraint,
whatever
that
case
maybe,
it
cannot
be
this
case.
whatever
that
case
maybe,
it
sure
is
a
magnitude
of
an
obviousness
that
would
lead
to
the
eye
and
that’s
why
in
part
mr.
chief
justice,
i
mentioned
at
the
beginning
the
period
of
time
that
has
passed.
i
would
suppose
that
stretching
our
imagination
and
trying
to
envision
that
case,
the
one
characteristic
of
it,
suggested
indeed
by
the
example
of
chief
justice
hughes
recited,
suggested
by
the
phrase
that
the
second
circuit
used
which
is
probably
why
the
solicitor
general
resists
the
word
immediate.
the
single
characteristic
that
we
can
surely,
immediately
see
of
such
an
imagined
event,
would
be
that
it’s
obvious,
that
the
public
safety
is
in
issue,
the
time
of
the
essence.
i
submit
that
that
cannot
be
this
case.
it
cannot
be
that
it
has
taken,
that
it
has
to
take
the
government
which
has
been
reviewing
this
documents
for
many
months,
not
just
in
connection
with
this
case
but
in
reply
to
an
inquiry
made
by
senator
fulbright
is
the
record
of
our
hearings
in
new
york
shows,
it
cannot
be
that
a
government
consisting
after
all
of
more
than
just
the
three
witnesses,
five
witness
that
we
heard
in
new
york
or
the
ones
that
were
heard
here,
over
this
length
of
time
has
an
unfamiliar
--
unfamiliarity
with
these
documents,
substantially
they
might
be
which
is
so
great
that
when
news
of
their
publication
comes
up,
no
body
in
the
government
knows
that
somewhere
in
those
documents
is
one
which
presents
a
mortal
danger
to
the
security
of
the
united
states.
and
i
would
submit
secondly
that
while
error
is
always
possible,
judge
griffin
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
which
affirmed
them
on
the
record
that
he
had
before
him
and
judge
gesell
in
the
court
of
appeals
here,
all
those
judges
can't
have
been
that
wrong.
this
--
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
yes
sir.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
not
entirely,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
for
example
the
death
of
soldiers.
i
would
disagree
that
that
impairment
of
diplomatic
relations
can
be
a
case
for
a
prior
restraint,
i
would
say
even
under
a
statute.
i
would
not
disagree
that
the
death
of
soldiers
as
in
troop
ship
or
as
an
example,
chief
justice
hughes
did.
the
difficulty
i
would
have
would
be
that
nothing
that
any
of
these
judges
including
judge
wilkey
because
he
i
suppose
is
talking
about
what
might
be
shown
by
the
government,
nothing
that
any
of
these
judges
have
seen
is
related
by
a
direct
casual
change
to
the
death
of
soldiers
or
anything
grave
of
that
sort.
what
characterizes,
i
have
heard
it
and
everything
i
have
read,
what
characterizes
every
instance
in
which
the
government
tries
to
make
its
case
factually
is
a
chain
of
causation
whose
lengths
are
surmised
and
speculation,
all
going
toward
some
distant
event
itself,
not
of
the
gravity
that
i
would
suggest
is
offensive.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
well,
i
beg
your
pardon
mr.
justice,
i
am
not
familiar
and
i
should
be
with
the
washington
post
case.
i
had
thought
that
judge
wilkey
talked
about
--
dissented
on
the
ground
that
he
would
like
more
evidence
to
come
in.
if
he
found
--
if
this
is
a
statement
about
the
evidence
that
he
heard
or
that
was
heard
before
judge
gesell
then
depending
on
what
the
standard
is
that
he
has
in
mind,
i
would
think
that
language
doesn’t
quite
communicate
to
me
what
the
standard
is
and
i
doubt
that
it’s
the
standard
that
i
would
contend,
the
narrow
standard
that
i
would
contend
for,
depending
on
the
standard
that
he
has
in
mind,
he
is
either
wrong
about
a
standard
or
seven
judges
disagreed
with
him,
but
i’m
sorry.
i’m
not
sufficient
familiar
with
the
washington
post
case.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
the
standard
--
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
the
standard
that
i
would
contend
for
and
the
difficulties
of
words
are
simply
enormous,
one
has
to
--
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
--
bring
in
to
those
mind
an
image
of
something,
some
event
and
try
to
describe
it.
the
standard
that
i
would
contend
for
would
have
two
parts
of
it.
one
would
be
and
let
me
also
say
that
i
would
differentiate
between
a
standard
applicable
to
the
president
acting
on
his
own.
the
president
acting
in
the
case
saved
pre
se
hirabayashi
for
example
and
a
prior
restraint
being
imposed
pursuant
to
a
well
drawn
statute
which
defines
the
standard
in
the
case.
i
would
demand
less
of
the
statute
than
i
would
demand
to
the
president.
but
the
standard
in
general
that
i
would
have
in
mind
would
at
one
end
have
a
great
event,
a
danger
to
the
nation.
some
of
the
things
described
in
the
top
secret,
in
description
of
top
secret
classification
in
the
executive
order,
solicitor
general
read
off,
would
i
think
fit
that
end
of
the
standard.
at
the
other
end
would
be
the
fact
of
publication
and
i
would
demand
and
this
would
be
my
second
element
that
the
chain,
the
length
between
the
fact
of
publication
and
the
feared
danger,
the
feared
event
be
direct
and
immediate
and
visible.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
that
would
be
chiefly
for
the
reason
that
as
is
notorious.
classifications
are
imposed
--
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
which
are
properly.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
that’s
correct,
mr.
justice.
i
would
say
that
parts
of
--
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
that
there
is
no
--
well,
no.
i
don’t
know
about
--
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
i
have
no
knowledge.
i’ve
never
been
near
the
documents
mr.
justice.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
i
would
say
that
today
i
had,
if
asked
that
question
on
the
day
we
appeared,
at
the
day
i
appeared
before
judge
gurfein
on
a
temporary
restraining
order,
my
answer
would
have
been,
i
expect
not,
i
trust
the
people
at
times.
i
--
i’m
fairly
certain
not,
by
now,
mr.
justice
after
all
this
time
having
read
the
submissions
of
the
government
although
i
was
hit
with
another
one
this
morning,
not
a
separate
submission,
but
an
explication
of
the
earlier
ones
but
i
haven’t
had
a
chance
to
glance
at,
yet
this
literature
like
some
scholarly
literature
tends
to
get
ahead
of
us.
having
read
the
submissions
of
the
government,
i
am
flatly
persuaded
that
there’s
nothing
in
there
because
if
there’s
nothing
that
would
meet
my
standard
in
there
for
a
statute
or
for
a
independent
executive
action
because
if
there
were,
it
surely
should
have
timed
out
by
now.
it
cannot
be
that
after
i
gather,
the
solicitor
general
had
the
same
experience
yesterday
afternoon
that
i
saw
judge
gurfein
have
it.
please
show
me?
now
which
are
the
three,
which
are
the
five,
which
are
the
ten?
which
are
the
most
important
of
these?
all
that
one
ever
got,
all
that
i’ve
ever
heard
have
been
statements
of
the
feared
events
in
terms
of
effect
on
diplomatic
relations.
if
it’s
a
military
matter,
why
then
in
terms
of
the
addition
of
a
possible
cause
to
a
train
causal
factor,
to
a
train
of
event
that’s
well
on
the
rails
as
is
and
propelled
by
sufficient
other
factors.
that
sort
of
statement
is
the
only
thing
we’ve
heard
and
i
would
submit
that
that
does
not
meet
any
possible
first
amendment
standard.
it
doesn’t
meet
it
either
in
the
statement
of
the
seriousness
of
the
event
that’s
feared
or
what
is
more
important
and
more
obvious
in
this
case
in
the
drawing
of
the
link
between
the
act
of
publication
as
the
cause
of
that
event
and
the
event
that
is
feared.
that
link
is
always
i
suggest
speculative,
full
of
surmises
and
a
chain
of
causation
that
after
its
first
one
or
two
links,
gets
involved
with
other
causes
operating
in
the
same
areas,
so
it
becomes
--
so
that
what
finally
cause
of
the
ultimate
event
becomes
impossible
to
say
which
the
effective
cause
was.
and
my
--
the
standard
that
i
would
propose
under
the
first
amendment
would
not
be
satisfied
by
such
showing.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
that’s
exactly
correct.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
yes,
i
was
addressing
myself
only
to
the
events
--
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
i
would
insist
that
for
purposes
certainly
of
any
action
in
the
president’s
inherent
power
which
is
the
case
before
us.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
yes
sir.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
mr.
justice,
i
wish
there
were
a
statute
that
covered
it.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
i’m
addressing
a
case
which
i
am
as
confident
as
i
can
be
of
anything,
your
honor,
will
not
find
when
you
get
back
to
your
chambers.
it’s
a
hard
case.
i
think
it
would
make
bad
separation
of
powers,
but
it’s
almost
impossible
to
resist
the
inclination
not
to
let
that
information
be
published
of
course.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
you
are
posing
or
--
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
your
opposing
the
case
of
course
mr.
justice
in
which
that
element
of
my
attempted
definition
which
refers
to
the
chain
of
causation.
i
mean,
--
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
no
--
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
no
sir.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
no
sir,
but
i
meant
--
it’s
a
case
in
which
the
chain
of
causation
between
the
act
of
publication
and
the
feared
event,
the
death
of
this
hundred
young
man
is
obvious,
direct,
immediate.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
that’s
right.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
i
only
say
as
to
that
that
it
is
a
case
in
which
in
the
absence
of
a
statute,
i
suppose
most
of
us
would
say
--
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
no.
i’m
afraid
i
have
--
i’m
afraid
my
--
the
inclinations
of
humanity
overcome
the
somewhat
more
abstract
devotion
to
the
first
amendment
in
a
case
to
that
sort.
i
would
wish
that
congress
took
a
look
to
the
seldom
used
and
at
the
seldom
used
and
not
very
--
in
not
a
very
good
shape
espionage
act
and
clean
them
up
so
that
we
could
have
statutes
that
are
clearly
applicable
within
vagueness
rules
and
what
not
and
so
that
we
that
we
don’t
have
to
rely
on
presidential
power.
but
the
burden
of
the
question
is
do
i
assume
that
the
event
has
to
be
of
cosmic
--
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
well,
no
sir.
the
examples
given
by
chief
justice
hughes
himself
are
not.
a
troop
ship
is
in
the
sense
that
hundred
men
or
the
location
of
a
platoon
is
in
the
sense
that
hundred
men.
i
don’t
assume
that.
i
have
--
i
do
honestly
think
that
that
hard
case
would
make
very
bad
separation
of
powers.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
mr.
chief
justice,
on
that
question
which
is
of
course
a
good
deal
nearer
to
what’s
bruited
about
anyway
in
the
record
of
this
case.
i
can
only
say
that
unless
which
i
can
imagine
can
be
possible,
the
link
of
causation
is
made
direct
and
immediate.
whether
the
--
even
though
the
event
might
be
somewhat
--
somewhat
distant,
but
unless
it
can
be
demonstrated
that
it
is
really
true
if
you
publish
this,
that
will
happen
or
there
is
a
high
probability
rather
than
as
is
typical
of
those
events.
there
are
17
causes
feeding
into
them.
three
of
those
are
--
anyone
of
those
other
than
the
publication
is
entirely
capable
of
being
the
single
effective
cause.
and
the
real
argument
is,
well
you
add
publication
to
that
and
it
makes
it
a
little
more
difficult.
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
that
that
is
a
risk
that
the
first
amendment
signifies
that
this
society
is
willing
to
take,
that
is
part
of
the
risk
of
freedom
that
i
would
certainly
take.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
mr.
chief
--
i’m
sorry.
what
--
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
mr.
chief
justice
that
there
--
i
think
it
--
i’m
perfectly
clear
in
my
mind
that
the
president
without
statutory
authority,
no
statutory
basis
goes
into
court
asks
for
an
injunction
on
that
basis,
that
if
youngstown
sheet
&
tube
company
v.
sawyer
means
anything,
he
does
not
get
it.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
now
--
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
where
under
a
statute,
we
don’t
face
it
in
this
case
and
i
really
don’t
know.
i’d
have
to
face
that
if
i
saw
it.
if
i
saw
the
statute,
if
i
saw
how
definite
it
was.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
well
--
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
no
sir.
only
in
that
i
have
conceded
for
purposes
of
this
argument
that
some
limitation,
some
impairment
of
the
absoluteness
of
that
prohibition
is
possible
and
i
argue
that
whatever
that
maybe,
whatever
that
maybe
it
is
surely
at
its
very
least
when
the
president
acts
without
statutory
authority
because
that
inserts
into
it
as
well
as
separation
of
powers.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
well,
i
didn’t
really
argue
that
mr.
justice.
at
least
i
have
--
i
hope
--
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
well,
i
replied
to
the
chief
justice
on
a
case
that
arose
without
a
statute
and
far
distinguished
because
its
crucial
to
the
--
for
purposes
of
this
case
to
distinguish
between
the
authority
which
is
here
claimed
of
the
president
to
act
independently
without
a
statute
and
the
possibly
greater
authority
of
the
whole
government
through
the
machinery
of
legislation
to
act
in
similar
premises
of
which
i
concede
nothing
that
i
don’t
have
to
mr.
justice.
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
well,
there
are
some
cases
that
are
on
this
court’s
docket
as
you
know
mr.
chief
justice
for
next
fall.
one
of
them
with
which
i’m
most
familiar
is
the
caldwell
case
from
california
in
which
there
was
a
refusal
to
reveal
sources
upheld
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
even
to
the
point
of
not
requiring
an
appearance
before
the
grand
jury.
but
the
claim
is
very
substantially
qualified,
that
is
to
say
caldwell
holds,
one
doesn’t
know
how
far
that
might
be
taken
and
perhaps
some
of
the
other
cases
will
require
the
argument
to
take
it
somewhat
farther,
but
caldwell
on
its
own
holds
that
in
circumstances
where
the
government,
as
indeed
attorney
general
mitchell’s
regulations
themselves
provided,
which
are
issued
after
the
caldwell
case
started.
in
cases
where
the
government
hasn’t
shown
a
clear
necessity
for
the
evidence,
hasn’t
shown
that
it
hasn’t
been
able
to
get
it
elsewhere,
hasn’t
show
that
it’s
central,
inescapably
central
to
the
proof
of
whatever
crime
it
is
that
the
grand
jury
is
investigating
that
in
those
circumstances
where
the
claim
of
confidential
communication
is
made
by
the
reporter,
there
is
a
sufficient
first
amendment
interest
to
protect
that
claim
on
the
theory
that
if
confidential
sources
dry
up
and
they
--
the
theory
runs
would
dry
up
because
there
were
no
protection
of
confidentiality,
there
would
be
a
diminished
flow
of
news.
i
know
that
--
mr.
alexander
m.
bickel
mr.
chief
justice,
i
know
there
is
an
appearance
of
unfairness
or
unevenness
about
it,
but
i
think
the
answer
that
a
reporter
would
make
and
an
answer
that
i
find
wholly
persuasive
is
that
neither
in
this
case
nor
in
a
case
like
caldwell
does
the
new
york
times
or
does
a
reporter
claim
something
for
himself,
but
rather
that
the
claim
is
made
in
order
to
vindicate
the
first
amendment
and
those
interests
which
that
great
document
serves.
thank
you.
