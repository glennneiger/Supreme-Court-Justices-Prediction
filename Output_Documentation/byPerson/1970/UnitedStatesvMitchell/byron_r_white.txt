justice
byron
r.
white
now,
as
a
practical
matter,
how
can
she
possibly
file
a
return?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
he
is
pretty
available,
he
just
tells
us
“it’s
none
her
business.”
you
do
contend
that
she
is
obligated
to
file
the
return
for
both
of
them,
don’t
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
just
for
her,
how
much?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
her
own
income
or
her
share
of
the
community
income?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
where
does
she
know?
how
could
she
possibly
find
that
out?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
you’re
not
faced
with
any
practical
difficulties,
she
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
can
she?
where
did
she
get
the
information
to
file
a
return?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
how
could
she
ever
protect
herself
from
penalty,
she
can
file
a
return
and
say,
“i
don’t
--
my
husband
refuses
to
tell
me
what
the
community
income
is,
but
i
have
income
on
my
own.
i
can
tell
what
my
contribution
is.
other
than
this,
i’m
awfully
sorry.”
would
that
be
a
compliant?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
bray.
justice
byron
r.
white
judge
ainsworth
was
a
member
of
the
panel
in
the
fifth
circuit,
was
he
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
judge
ainsworth
dissented.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
what
bothers
me,
judge
ainsworth
is
a
louisiana
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
made
the
majority.
i
wondered
if
you
had
any
comment
on
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
other
two
are
floridians
and
they
split.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
bray,
does
texas
have
community
property?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
a
texan.
justice
byron
r.
white
i’m
still
bothered
by
this
renunciation
provision.
i
think,
it’s
2410
under
the
louisiana
statutes.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
one
that
can
be
exercise
only
after
the
community
is
dissolved,
could
it
be
exercised
prenuptially
for
example?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do
not
have
it
in
texas?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
cut
the
same
thing
--
justice
byron
r.
white
can’t
the
same
thing
be
said
of
the
embezzlement
cases,
and
i
think
jones,
the
holding
of
this
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
in
this
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
limited
partner
has
remedies
under
local
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
when
you
find
out
it
impairs
the
partnership.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
case,
she
never
finds
out.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
did
she
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
we’re
talking
about
louisiana.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
she
is
--
this
woman
now
has
an
obligation
as
her
husband?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
louisiana
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
i
take
it
you
disagree
with
mr.
bray’s
inference
to
the
contrary
that
she
could
compel
him
to
disgorge
her
share
of
the
income?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that’s
this
situation,
isn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean,
he
can’t
terminate
that
even
she
can
show
that
he
is
squandering
her
contribution
in
the
community?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
both
parties
supported
obligations
to
pay
the
tax.
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
other
hand,
he
can
squander
it,
can’t
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
the
content
of
your
hypothetical?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
interrupt
you,
wouldn’t
that
seem
comment
however
apply
to
the
fraudulent
income
and
embezzlement
cases
that
went
the
other
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you’re
distinguishing
those
cases
i
take
it
on
some
kind
of
theory
or
waiver
certainly
in
the
criminal
field
we’d
looked
pretty
sharp
any
such
of
waiver
these
days
and
i
think
your
precedent
against
you
is
all
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
think
the
case
is
that
you
just
attempted
to
distinguish
by
saying
that
a
wife
when
she
signs
a
joint
return
in
effect
consents
to
be
liable
for
income
of
which
she
has
no
knowledge,
embezzled
income
of
her
husband.
that’s
the
way
you
distinguish
that
case
(voice
overlap).
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
all
i’m
saying
is
she
is
in
as
hard
the
position
as
your
client
is
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
say
that
because
of
their
theory
of
who’s
in
company?
justice
byron
r.
white
what’s
that
--
if
we
have
constitution
to
tax
us?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
the
husband
said,
this
court
said
that
the
--
that
you
can’t
tax
eve
the
wife.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
what
would
be
unconstitutional
to
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
while
counsel
often
says,
it’s
none
of
your
business,
whatever.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
she
just
says
she’s
awfully
sorry.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
i’m
supporting
that
when
you
can’t
have
(inaudible)
that
i
have
no
power
to
do
it
and
take
some
oral
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
suppose
the
supreme
court
of
your
state
was
talking
about
when
it
talked
about
title
vesting
at
the
very
instant
the
property
is
acquired?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then
she
can
--
the
creditors
can
go
after
her
if
she
renounces?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
once
the
debts
then
occurred
she
can
escape
them
and
the
community
terminates?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
similarly
you
suggest
the
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
according
to
your
position
that
by
renouncing,
she
can
escape
liability
for
a
community
debt
that
otherwise
she
would
be
liable?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that’s
what
i
say.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
renounce?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
let’s
assume
that
the
community
terminates,
she
does
nothing
about
renouncing?
justice
byron
r.
white
can’t
she
have
income
that’s
hers?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
your
own
court
has
talked
a
little
bit
about
ownership
though
in
messersmith.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
are
responsible
for
this
split
income
possibility.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
by
you,
i
mean
the
community
property
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
ask
of
you
the
question
i
asked
mr.
bray
perhaps
unfairly
because
he
is
not
a
louisiana.
do
you
have
any
comment
about
the
renunciations
statute
as
to
when
it
is
effective
and
may
it
be
exercised
prenuptially?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
may
a
wife
renounce
only
when
the
community
has
been
disrupted?
justice
byron
r.
white
has
vested
him
action
for?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
it’s
unconstitutional
to
tax
her,
to
make
her
file
income
tax
or
tax
her
at
least
to
the
extent
that
she
had
income
of
her
own
which
went
into
the
community?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
she
would
at
least
know
what
she
had?
justice
byron
r.
white
she
would
at
least
know
what
went
in
the
community.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
she
earns
separate
income?
what
if
her
teaching
school,
the
tax
paid
out
to
her
and
she
(inaudible).
and
says,
i
am
awfully
sorry
but
i
don’t
trust
you
for
anything
and
i’m
just
keeping
my
money.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
about
that
time
that
the
community
would
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
then
the
government
could
collect
the
entire
trans
bill
for
the
entire
community
from
her
husband?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
this
require
any
modification
of
prior
cases
in
this
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
no
case
or
intimation
in
our
cases
that
the
government
may
not
collect
the
entire
tax
bill
from
the
husband?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
malcolm
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
number
one
the
malcolm
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
certified
questions?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
the
end-result
then
of
your
position
is
that
the
husband
should
--
is
responsible
for
the
entire
tax
bill
for
the
community?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
wife
has
no
really
substantial
present
interest
in
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
therefore,
it
should
be
no
division
of
income
for
purposes
of
the
tax
rates?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
louisiana
law
though
still
gives
her
or
not
of
an
interest
so
that
the
husband
doesn’t
need
to
pay
as
though
he
is
a
single
taxpayer?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
shouldn’t
we
--
why
shouldn’t
the
federal
government
take
you
seriously
then
to
say
to
the
husband
when
he
says,
when
they
try
to
collect
from
him
all
of
the
taxes
at
single
taxpayer’s
rates,
why
should
the
government
say,
will
you
tell
me
that
this
doesn’t
belong
to
the
wife,
she
has
no
interest
in
it?
how
do
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
at
the
full
rates?
justice
byron
r.
white
full
single
taxpayer
rate.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
schott,
help
me
a
little
bit
with
your
renouncement
argument.
has
it
none
always
been
the
case
that
the
renunciation
of
income
doesn’t
necessarily
lead
to
non-liability
for
tax
on
that
income?
justice
byron
r.
white
what’s
the
difference?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
can’t
the
--
why
couldn’t
the
government’s
theory
--
the
government
to
collect
the
husband’s
share
for
the
--
even
if
the
income
of
the
wife’s
set
of
property?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
it
isn’t
the
same
reason
that
you
could
collect?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
as
a
practical
matter,
how
can
she
possibly
file
a
return?
justice

that

of

don’t
you?
justice
byron

in
just
for
her,
how
much?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
her
own
income
or
her
share
of
the
community
income?
justice

now,
where
does
she
know?
how
could

find
that
out?
justice

but
you’re
not

with
any

how
can
she?
where
did

how

white
and
similarly
you
suggest
the
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
according
to
your
position
that
by
renouncing,
she
can
escape
liability
for
a
community
debt
that
otherwise
she
would
be
liable?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that’s
what
i
say.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
renounce?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
let’s
assume
that
the
community
terminates,
she
does
nothing
about
renouncing?
justice
byron
r.
white
can’t
she
have
income
that’s
hers?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
your
own
court
has
talked
a
little
bit
about
ownership
though
in
messersmith.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
are
responsible
for
this
split
income
possibility.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
by
you,
i
mean
the
community
property
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
ask
of
you
the
question
i
asked
mr.
bray
perhaps
unfairly
because
he
is
not
a
louisiana.
do
you
have
any
comment
about
the
renunciations
statute
as
to
when
it
is
effective
and
may
it
be
exercised
prenuptially?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
may
a
wife
renounce
only
when
the
community
has
been
disrupted?
justice
byron
r.
white
has
vested
him
action
for?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
it’s
unconstitutional
to
tax
her,
to
make
her
file
income
tax
or
tax
her
at
least
to
the
extent
that
she
had
income
of
her
own
which
went
into
the
community?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
she
would
at
least
know
what
she
had?
justice
byron
r.
white
she
would
at
least
know
what
went
in
the
community.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
she
earns
separate
income?
what
if
her
teaching
school,
the
tax
paid
out
to
her
and
she
(inaudible).
and
says,
i
am
awfully
sorry
but
i
don’t
trust
you
for
anything
and
i’m
just
keeping
my
money.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
about
that
time
that
the
community
would
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
then
the
government
could
collect
the
entire
trans
bill
for
the
entire
community
from
her
husband?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
this
require
any
modification
of
prior
cases
in
this
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
no
case
or
intimation
in
our
cases
that
the
government
may
not
collect
the
entire
tax
bill
from
the
husband?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
malcolm
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
number
one
the
malcolm
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
certified
questions?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
the
end-result
then
of
your
position
is
that
the
husband
should
--
is
responsible
for
the
entire
tax
bill
for
the
community?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
wife
has
no
really
substantial
present
interest
in
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
therefore,
it
should
be
no
division
of
income
for
purposes
of
the
tax
rates?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
louisiana
law
though
still
gives
her
or
not
of
an
interest
so
that
the
husband
doesn’t
need
to
pay
as
though
he
is
a
single
taxpayer?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
shouldn’t
we
--
why
shouldn’t
the
federal
government
take
you
seriously
then
to
say
to
the
husband
when
he
says,
when
they
try
to
collect
from
him
all
of
the
taxes
at
single
taxpayer’s
rates,
why
should
the
government
say,
will
you
tell
me
that
this
doesn’t
belong
to
the
wife,
she
has
no
interest
in
it?
how
do
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
at
the
full
rates?
justice
byron
r.
white
full
single
taxpayer
rate.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
schott,
help
me
a
little
bit
with
your
renouncement
argument.
has
it
none
always
been
the
case
that
the
renunciation
of
income
doesn’t
necessarily
lead
to
non-liability
for
tax
on
that
income?
justice
byron
r.
white
what’s
the
difference?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
can’t
the
--
why
couldn’t
the
government’s
theory
--
the
government
to
collect
the
husband’s
share
for
the
--
even
if
the
income
of
the
wife’s
set
of
property?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
it
isn’t
the
same
reason
that
you
could
collect?
