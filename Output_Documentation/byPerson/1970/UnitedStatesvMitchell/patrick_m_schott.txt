mr.
patrick
m.
schott
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i’m
here
on
behalf
of
the
other
respondent
frances
angello
and
your
honors
if
you
would
indulge
me
for
just
one
moment,
i
cannot
stand
here
and
launch
on
my
argument
without
noting
that
after
almost
20
years
before
the
bar.
this
has
to
be
the
one
of
the
greatest
moments
of
a
professional
career
to
argue
a
case
before
this
high
court.
and
i
do
thank
the
court
for
allowing
us
this
few
additional
minutes
to
make
this
argument.
your
honors,
the
policy
that
we
have
submitted
in
the
government’s
position
in
this
case
is
in
and
all
the
simple
of
occasion
of
an
issue
and
in
a
failure
to
consider
that
which
this
court
has
held
must
to
be
considered
in
order
to
make
a
determination
such
as
this.
for
instance,
my
opponent
made
the
statement
a
moment
ago
that
state
law
creates
a
legal
interest
while
federal
law
taxes
those
interests
so
created.
that
statement
is
incomplete,
that
is
not
with
this
court
has
held
and
if
that
were
a
complete
statement
of
the
law,
the
logic
of
the
government’s
position
may
very
well
follow.
but
what
this
court
has
held
and
what
this
court
has
said,
i
think
it’s
more
accurately
put
in
the
government’s
brief
on
page
14
and
15
where
they
said
that
--
excuse
me
your
honor.
the
government
has
cited
the
case
of
morgan
versus
commissioner
on
page
14
of
its
brief
and
in
that
case,
the
supreme
court
held
that
state
law
creates
illegal
interests
and
rights.
the
federal
revenue
acts
designate
what
interests
or
rights
so
created
shall
be
taxed.
now,
in
seaborn
and
in
bender
versus
pfaff
--
mr.
patrick
m.
schott
yes.
mr.
patrick
m.
schott
that
statement
is
“that
the
federal
government
taxes
interests
that
are
created
by
the
state,
but
state
law
determines
what
those
interests
are.”
now,
what
i
have
said
is
that
if
that
standing
alone
were
under
consideration
before
the
court
then
the
logic
of
the
government’s
argument
might
follow
that
therefore,
such
things
as
the
exemption
if
you
will
of
the
wife
separate
property
from
vulnerability
of
seizure
by
a
community
creditor
or
mere
exemption
statutes.
but
that
is
not
what
the
law
is,
what
i
say
the
law
is
that
federal
law
indeed
does
designate
the
interests
to
be
taxed
but
also
the
rights
that
the
state
law
creates.
federal
law
designates
the
rights
that
are
to
be
taxed
also
and
i
say
that
in
that
omission
by
the
government
of
a
look
at
what
is
the
right
of
the
wife
to
renounce
the
community.
in
that
omission,
is
the
crux
of
the
government’s
error
in
this
case.
under
louisiana
community
property
law,
it
is
true
that
the
wife
has
a
present
vested
interest
in
the
property.
however,
that
law
says
that
she
has
a
right
to
renounce
the
community
and
under
our
holdings
of
our
supreme
court,
it
is
as
though
the
community
never
existed
as
far
as
she
was
concerned.
now,
the
reasons
for
this
of
course
have
already
been
touched
upon
by
my
colleague
mr.
kirkpatrick
in
talking
about
the
almost
unlimited
control
that
the
husband
has
over
the
community
property.
for
instance,
an
answer
to
a
question
by
the
chief
justice,
the
question
was,
can
the
husband
alienate
the
homestead?
the
answer
for
that
question
is
yes.
now,
there
is
a
provision
in
the
state
law
which
gives
the
right
to
the
wife
to
file
a
declaration
of
homestead
and
prevent
the
husband
from
doing
so.
this
is
not
usually
exercise
and
if
the
ownership
or
title
of
the
property
is
taken
in
the
name
of
the
husband
alone
even
though
it
is
the
homestead.
and
the
wife
and
children
live
in
the
home,
the
husband
is
free
to
alienate
that
property
and
he
cannot
be
forbidden
from
the
wife
in
doing
so
or
he
cannot
be
call
upon
to
account
to
the
wife
after
he
has
done
it.
so,
i
say
to
the
court
that
because
of
this
great
power
of
control
and
because
of
the
very
effects
that
would
flow
from
the
hypothetical
which
we
have
inserted
in
our
brief,
which
i
think
is
a
good
analysis
and
a
sound
analysis
or
an
analogy
excuse
me.
i
think
the
government
has
admitted
that
the
effect
of
their
position
would
be
that
where
the
husband
earns
his
money,
squanders
it.
they
can
come
back
to
the
wife
and
ask
the
wife
to
pay
on
half
of
the
income
that
she
never
saw,
never
controlled,
never
enjoyed
it
could
not
do
anything
about
it.
mr.
patrick
m.
schott
i
think
that
the
logical
extension
of
louisiana
community
property
law
if
it’s
left
understood
in
this
case
is
that
the
husband
owes
all
of
the
community
income
tax
because
the
husband
under
louisiana
law
does
not
have
that
same
right
than
the
wife.
mr.
patrick
m.
schott
no,
i
don’t
believe
it
would
your
honor.
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
the
only
prior
cases
that
the
government
relies
upon
being
seaborn
and
bender
are
cases
that
stand
only
for
the
proposition
that
if
the
wife
chooses
to
file
a
separate
--
joint
return
or
separate
return,
split
income
in
other
words,
she
has
enough
a
sufficient
vested
interest
in
the
community
to
do
so.
the
government
would
have
you
extend
that
to
mean
that
because
she
has
that
sufficient
vested
interest,
she
therefore
we
just
all
look
her
rights.
that
is
the
right
to
renounce
in
the
event
that
she
chooses
to
do
so
under
our
law.
now,
the
other
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
to
the
court
--
mr.
patrick
m.
schott
i
find
none
your
honor.
i
find
none.
mr.
patrick
m.
schott
no,
your
honor
malcolm
is
a
case
of
course
that
he
is
--
mr.
patrick
m.
schott
that
is
a
per
curiam
decision
and
--
mr.
patrick
m.
schott
that
case
was
--
a
case
in
which
the
husband
and
wife
had
filed
a
joint
return
and
i
think
that
does
make
all
the
difference
in
the
world
because
in
effect,
the
wife
in
signing
the
joint
return
makes
herself
automatically
liable
under
the
tax
laws.
now,
i
might
add
to
your
honors
that
even
under
louisiana
community
property
law.
for
instance,
if
the
husband
borrows
money
and
he
signed
his
name
on
a
note.
under
the
law,
he
obligates
the
community,
but
he
does
not
make
the
wife
individually
liable
so
that
her
separate
property
can
be
seized
to
satisfy
that
debt.
however,
--
mr.
patrick
m.
schott
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
m.
schott
she
doesn’t
have
anyway
of
controlling
it,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
m.
schott
if
she
has
a
sufficient
interest
under
poe
and
bender
in
order
to
split
the
income
for
tax
purposes
but
to
say
to
the
wife
now
that
even
though
you’re
renounce
the
community
--
mr.
patrick
m.
schott
i
think
that
it
does.
in
fact,
your
honor
i
was
going
to
add
that
the
malcolm
situation
and
the
thought
that
i
was
trying
to
make
here
and
answer
to
mr.
justice
stewart’s
question
was
this.
that
under
louisiana
law,
if
a
husband
and
wife
both
signed
that
same
note
to
the
finance
company.
in
other
words,
the
wife
has
not
joined
in
signing
that
note,
under
louisiana
law;
she
has
voluntarily
then
obligated
herself
personally
to
pay
the
debt
so
that
then
her
separate
property
can
be
reached.
but
the
point
is
that
the
husband
can
actually
endanger
the
community,
all
of
the
wife’s
interest
in
the
community
when
he
signs
that
note.
and
it’s
under
that
condition
and
we
say
that
the
law
has
provided
for
the
wife
to
renounce.
and
your
honor,
the
only
have
a
point
i
want
to
make
for
the
court
is
that
the
government’s
characterization
of
what
i
have
called
the
wife’s
separate
property
is
immunity
if
you
will
from
vulnerability
to
seizure
by
the
government
for
tax
purposes.
that
has
been
characterized
by
the
government
as
a
state
exemption
statute.
the
way
you
would
exempt
for
instance
insurance
proceeds
under
law
or
the
way
you
might
exempt
the
tools
of
trade
from
seizure
that
type
of
thing.
your
honor,
i
think
that
that
is
almost
a
crest
characterization.
this
is
an
integral
part
of
our
community
property
system
which
flows
logically
from
the
others
that
since
the
wife
can
renounce
and
since
she
doesn’t
have
control,
therefore
her
separate
property
cannot
be
seized
by
a
community
creditor.
and
i
say
to
the
court
that
that
is
not
merely
an
exemption
statute
that
the
federal
law
preempts
more
than
that.
it
is
an
integral
part
of
our
community
property
system
which
i
believe
would
have
to
be
respected
in
determining
what
her
rights
are
for
the
imposition
of
federal
income
tax.
mr.
patrick
m.
schott
your
honor,
certainly
that
the
federal
income
tax
laws
could
be
amended
so
as
to
require
the
husband
to
pay
all
the
taxes
as
mr.
bray
pointed
out
in
his
address
to
the
court.
there’s
no
doubt
that
they
could
amend
the
federal
tax
law
if
that
needs
to
be
done
to
make
the
state
law
consistent
in
this
case.
but
what
i’m
saying
is
that
an
analysis
of
louisiana
state
community
property
law
does
lead
to
the
conclusion.
one,
that
the
wife
may
renounce
and
avoid
the
payment
of
that
tax
and
two,
that
the
husband
himself
would
be
the
one
who
would
owe
the
tax
with
the
seaborn
decisions
injunction.
mr.
patrick
m.
schott
at
the
full
rate
unless,
under
the
--
mr.
patrick
m.
schott
that
is
correct
except
for
the
federal
regulation
which
permit
her
to
sign
that
joint
return
as
she
did
in
malcolm
and
make
herself
liable
for
half
of
it.
and
of
course
the
decision
in
seaborn,
which
says
merely
that
she
has
sufficient
vested
interest
in
the
community
to
go
ahead
and
declare
half
of
the
taxes
and
return
half
of
the
income.
mr.
patrick
m.
schott
your
honor,
in
louisiana
a
renunciation
of
the
community
by
the
wife
is
a
peculiar
aspect
of
our
community
property
law
which
gives
the
right
to
the
wife,
the
right
to
renounce
not
only
the
benefits
of
the
community
but
also
the
obligations
of
the
community
to
the
extent
that
the
community
as
far
as
she
was
concerned
never
existed.
she
can
disassociate
herself
from
all
of
the
assets
as
well
as
all
of
the
liabilities
on
a
renunciation
or
a
refusal
if
he
will
to
accept
that
community.
now,
i
don’t
think
that
that
is
the
same
as
a
renunciation
of
income
in
a
state
for
instance
which
would
not
have
this
peculiar
concept
that
gives
the
wife
the
right
to
do
this.
mr.
patrick
m.
schott
well,
i
think
your
honor
as
mr.--
as
my
colleague
pointed
out
i
think
that
you
are
looking
at
a
bundle
of
rights
here.
and
to
say
that
she
has
a
sufficient
interest
in
the
community
to
go
ahead
the
return
the
half
of
the
income
and
then
to
ignore
her
right
to
that
statute
--
that
renunciation
under
our
law
which
our
court
has
held
would
place
are
in
this
position
as
though
the
community
never
existed
is
to
simply
ignore
one
part
of
our
property
rights
system
and
to
put
undue
emphasis
on
the
other.
mr.
patrick
m.
schott
thank
you
very
much.

patrick
m.
schott

because
of
the
very
effects
that
would
flow
from
the
hypothetical
which
we
have
inserted
in
our
brief,
which
i
think
is
a
good
analysis
and
a
sound
analysis
or
an
analogy
excuse
me.
i
think
the
government
has
admitted
that
the
effect
of
their
position
would
be
that
where
the
husband
earns
his
money,
squanders
it.
they
can
come
back
to
the
wife
and
ask
the
wife
to
pay
on
half
of
the
income
that
she
never
saw,
never
controlled,
never
enjoyed
it
could
not
do
anything
about
it.
mr.
patrick
m.
schott
i
think
that
the
logical
extension
of
louisiana
community
property
law
if
it’s
left
understood
in
this
case
is
that
the
husband
owes
all
of
the
community
income
tax
because
the
husband
under
louisiana
law
does
not
have
that
same
right
than
the
wife.
mr.
patrick
m.
schott
no,
i
don’t
believe
it
would
your
honor.
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
the
only
prior
cases
that
the
government
relies
upon
being
seaborn
and
bender
are
cases
that
stand
only
for
the
proposition
that
if
the
wife
chooses
to
file
a
separate
--
joint
return
or
separate
return,
split
income
in
other
words,
she
has
enough
a
sufficient
vested
interest
in
the
community
to
do
so.
the
government
would
have
you
extend
that
to
mean
that
because
she
has
that
sufficient
vested
interest,
she
therefore
we
just
all
look
her
rights.
that
is
the
right
to
renounce
in
the
event
that
she
chooses
to
do
so
under
our
law.
now,
the
other
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
to
the
court
--
mr.
patrick
m.
schott
i
find
none
your
honor.
i
find
none.
mr.
patrick
m.
schott
no,
your
honor
malcolm
is
a
case
of
course
that
he
is
--
mr.
patrick
m.
schott
that
is
a
per
curiam
decision
and
--
mr.
patrick
m.
schott
that
case
was
--
a
case
in
which
the
husband
and
wife
had
filed
a
joint
return
and
i
think
that
does
make
all
the
difference
in
the
world
because
in
effect,
the
wife
in
signing
the
joint
return
makes
herself
automatically
liable
under
the
tax
laws.
now,
i
might
add
to
your
honors
that
even
under
louisiana
community
property
law.
for
instance,
if
the
husband
borrows
money
and
he
signed
his
name
on
a
note.
under
the
law,
he
obligates
the
community,
but
he
does
not
make
the
wife
individually
liable
so
that
her
separate
property
can
be
seized
to
satisfy
that
debt.
however,
--
mr.
patrick
m.
schott
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
m.
schott
she
doesn’t
have
anyway
of
controlling
it,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
m.
schott
if
she
has
a
sufficient
interest
under
poe
and
bender
in
order
to
split
the
income
for
tax
purposes
but
to
say
to
the
wife
now
that
even
though
you’re
renounce
the
community
--
mr.
patrick
m.
schott
i
think
that
it
does.
in
fact,
your
honor
i
was
going
to
add
that
the
malcolm
situation
and
the
thought
that
i
was
trying
to
make
here
and
answer
to
mr.
justice
stewart’s
question
was
this.
that
under
louisiana
law,
if
a
husband
and
wife
both
signed
that
same
note
to
the
finance
company.
in
other
words,
the
wife
has
not
joined
in
signing
that
note,
under
louisiana
law;
she
has
voluntarily
then
obligated
herself
personally
to
pay
the
debt
so
that
then
her
separate
property
can
be
reached.
but
the
point
is
that
the
husband
can
actually
endanger
the
community,
all
of
the
wife’s
interest
in
the
community
when
he
signs
that
note.
and
it’s
under
that
condition
and
we
say
that
the
law
has
provided
for
the
wife
to
renounce.
and
your
honor,
the
only
have
a
point
i
want
to
make
for
the
court
is
that
the
government’s
characterization
of
what
i
have
called
the
wife’s
separate
property
is
immunity
if
you
will
from
vulnerability
to
seizure
by
the
government
for
tax
purposes.
that
has
been
characterized
by
the
government
as
a
state
exemption
statute.
the
way
you
would
exempt
for
instance
insurance
proceeds
under
law
or
the
way
you
might
exempt
the
tools
of
trade
from
seizure
that
type
of
thing.
your
honor,
i
think
that
that
is
almost
a
crest
characterization.
this
is
an
integral
part
of
our
community
property
system
which
flows
logically
from
the
others
that
since
the
wife
can
renounce
and
since
she
doesn’t
have
control,
therefore
her
separate
property
cannot
be
seized
by
a
community
creditor.
and
i
say
to
the
court
that
that
is
not
merely
an
exemption
statute
that
the
federal
law
preempts
more
than
that.
it
is
an
integral
part
of
our
community
property
system
which
i
believe
would
have
to
be
respected
in
determining
what
her
rights
are
for
the
imposition
of
federal
income
tax.
mr.
patrick
m.
schott
your
honor,
certainly
that
the
federal
income
tax
laws
could
be
amended
so
as
to
require
the
husband
to
pay
all
the
taxes
as
mr.
bray
pointed
out
in
his
address
to
the
court.
there’s
no
doubt
that
they
could
amend
the
federal
tax
law
if
that
needs
to
be
done
to
make
the
state
law
consistent
in
this
case.
but
what
i’m
saying
is
that
an
analysis
of
louisiana
state
community
property
law
does
lead
to
the
conclusion.
one,
that
the
wife
may
renounce
and
avoid
the
payment
of
that
tax
and
two,
that
the
husband
himself
would
be
the
one
who
would
owe
the
tax
with
the
seaborn
decisions
injunction.
mr.
patrick
m.
schott
at
the
full
rate
unless,
under
the
--
mr.
patrick
m.
schott
that
is
correct
except
for
the
federal
regulation
which
permit
her
to
sign
that
joint
return
as
she
did
in
malcolm
and
make
herself
liable
for
half
of
it.
and
of
course
the
decision
in
seaborn,
which
says
merely
that
she
has
sufficient
vested
interest
in
the
community
to
go
ahead
and
declare
half
of
the
taxes
and
return
half
of
the
income.
mr.
patrick
m.
schott
your
honor,
in
louisiana
a
renunciation
of
the
community
by
the
wife
is
a
peculiar
aspect
of
our
community
property
law
which
gives
the
right
to
the
wife,
the
right
to
renounce
not
only
the
benefits
of
the
community
but
also
the
obligations
of
the
community
to
the
extent
that
the
community
as
far
as
she
was
concerned
never
existed.
she
can
disassociate
herself
from
all
of
the
assets
as
well
as
all
of
the
liabilities
on
a
renunciation
or
a
refusal
if
he
will
to
accept
that
community.
now,
i
don’t
think
that
that
is
the
same
as
a
renunciation
of
income
in
a
state
for
instance
which
would
not
have
this
peculiar
concept
that
gives
the
wife
the
right
to
do
this.
mr.
patrick
m.
schott
well,
i
think
your
honor
as
mr.--
as
my
colleague
pointed
out
i
think
that
you
are
looking
at
a
bundle
of
rights
here.
and
to
say
that
she
has
a
sufficient
interest
in
the
community
to
go
ahead
the
return
the
half
of
the
income
and
then
to
ignore
her
right
to
that
statute
--
that
renunciation
under
our
law
which
our
court
has
held
would
place
are
in
this
position
as
though
the
community
never
existed
is
to
simply
ignore
one
part
of
our
property
rights
system
and
to
put
undue
emphasis
on
the
other.
mr.
patrick
m.
schott
thank
you
very
much.
