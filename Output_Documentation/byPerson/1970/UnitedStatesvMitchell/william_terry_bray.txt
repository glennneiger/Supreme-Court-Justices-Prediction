mr.
william
terry
bray
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
these
combined
income
taxes
cases
are
here
on
certiorari
to
the
fifth
circuit.
they
involved
the
louisiana
community
property
system.
in
each
case,
a
husband
and
wife
living
in
louisiana
realized
community
income
of
which
each
own
one-half
under
the
louisiana
law.
no
federal
income
tax
returns
were
filed
by
either
spouse,
either
separately
or
jointly.
the
marriages
were
subsequently
dissolved
and
the
government
separately
assessed
each
wife
for
the
income
taxes
on
her
share
of
the
realized
but
unreported
community
income.
the
cases
present
a
single
question
whether
where
no
returns
have
been
filed
a
louisiana
wife
must
report
and
pay
the
federal
income
taxes
on
the
one-half
share
of
community
income
which
under
the
laws
of
that
state
she
owns.
in
each
of
these
cases,
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
she
need
not
do
so
where
she
neither
expressly
accepts
liability
for
those
taxes
nor
receives
any
benefits
from
the
community
property
upon
the
dissolution
of
the
community.
we
believe
that
in
doing
so,
that
court
failed
to
perceive
an
important
distinction.
one
which
we
feel
underlies
the
decision
in
this
case,
that
is
the
distinction
between
imposition
of
the
tax
on
one
hand
and
collection
of
the
tax
from
the
individual
owing
it
on
the
other.
mr.
william
terry
bray
in
the
mitchell
case,
it
was
partially
due
to
her
earnings.
in
the
angello
case,
the
record
indicates
that
all
of
the
community
income
was
due
to
the
husband’s
earnings.
in
neither
case,
was
any
significant
amount
of
income
due
to
the
wife’s
individual
separate
efforts.
this
however,
we
do
not
believe
determines
the
case
since
regardless
of
who
generates
the
income,
under
the
louisiana
law,
each
spouse
owns
an
undivided
one-half
interest
of
it
from
the
very
moment
it
comes
into
being.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes,
sir
and
even
before
that,
the
split
income
cases
in
the
1930
term
of
this
court.
to
that,
we
think
those
cases
decide
this
case
and
compel
the
result
for
which
we
here
content.
our
position
is
that
this
case
involves
only
the
imposition
of
the
tax
and
that
because
the
wife
owns
her
share
of
community
income,
she
is
tax
on
it.
while
we
recognize
that
our
position
may
result
in
hardships
in
certain
instances
to
why
as
residing
in
community
property
states.
yet,
we
think
the
law
is
clear
and
compels
the
position
that
we
take.
at
least
as
the
statutory
law
presently
exist.
in
some,
we
argue
that
it
is
now
and
for
many
years
prior
to
this
well
established
that
the
federal
statutes
imposed
the
tax
against
the
owner
of
the
income.
that
under
louisiana
law,
the
wife
owns
outright
her
one-half
interest
in
community
income
as
of
the
very
moment
that
it
comes
into
existence.
and
that
it
follows
that
she
must
report
and
pay
taxes
on
her
half.
on
the
other
hand,
as
regards
to
the
collection
of
these
taxes,
we
think
there
is
no
real
dispute
on
our
position
here.
the
state
laws
exempting
the
louisiana
wife
from
community
obligations
and
we
would
here
acknowledge
that
taxes
--
federal
income
taxes,
all
community
income
are
indeed
a
community
obligation.
but
these
state
laws
exonerating
the
wife
from
the
community
obligation
simply
are
ineffective
as
against
the
united
states
in
its
efforts
to
collect
the
tax
from
the
individual
owing
it.
the
dispute
here
really
is
whether
the
wife’s
ownership
of
her
community
income
--
her
share
of
community
income
is
sufficient
under
the
federal
statutes
for
that
statute
to
impose
the
tax
against
her
and
compel
her
to
return
it
and
pay
tax
on
it.
mr.
william
terry
bray
it
is
not,
it
was
common
in
the
spanish
law.
it
arose
under
the
spanish
law,
but
as
far
as
we
can
tell,
louisiana
is
the
only
state
which
has
carried
this
over
from
the
spanish
law.
i
might
point
out
in
that
regard
that
even
under
the
spanish
law,
it
was
very
clear
that
during
the
existence
of
the
marriage
the
wife
owned
that
right
her
half
of
community
income.
the
renunciation
provision
was
merely
one
designed
to
protect
her
from
community
creditors.
again,
community
creditor
or
rather
a
creditor
right
type
of
proposition
which
gave
her
the
right
upon
determination
of
the
marriage
to
forego
her
otherwise
vested
interest
in
the
community
income
and
for
that
matter,
all
community
property,
and
similarly
to
be
relieve
of
any
obligations
all
community
debts.
mr.
william
terry
bray
that’s
correct,
in
fact
in
these
cases,
one
dissolution
occurred
because
of
death.
mr.
william
terry
bray
no,
the
husband
does
not
and
this
is
because
again
originating
from
the
spanish
law.
the
husband
has
the
management
generally
speaking
of
the
community
property.
it
was
therefore
thought
that
because
he
manages
the
property,
he
ought
to
be
responsible
for
the
community
debts
regardless.
and
indeed,
historically,
not
only
was
he
responsible
in
the
sense
that
the
community
property
was
responsible
for
the
debts,
but
he
personally
was
responsible
for
those
community
debts.
in
other
words,
if
the
community
was
not
sufficient
to
take
care
of
the
community
debts,
he
had
to
come
out
of
his
own
separate
property
to
pay
those
debts.
mr.
william
terry
bray
well,
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes,
that
is
part
of
a
theory,
but
i
would
point
out
that
there
are
protections
for
the
wife
while
she
can’t
perhaps
compel
the
husband
to
pay
the
taxes
as
such.
yet,
she
does
have
protections
under
state
law
which
are
very
clearly
spelled
out
not
only
in
the
state
law
cases,
but
for
that
manner
in
the
two
cases
in
which
this
court
has
dealt
with
louisiana
community
property.
bender
versus
pfaff,
the
split
income
case
and
fernandez
versus
wiener,
the
state
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
the
federal
state
tax
case
and
in
both
instances
it
was
noted
that
while
the
husband
had
management
rights
over
her
half
of
community
property
nevertheless,
that
she
had
some
rather
special
provisions
of
state
law
which
protected
her
interest
in
that
property,
including
the
right
to
separate
her
property
from
her
husband’s
without
terminating
the
marriage
and
from
that
point
forward
to
have
complete
control
over
her
property.
mr.
william
terry
bray
as
a
practical
matter,
if
indeed
the
husband
is
unavailable,
she
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
no,
not
for
both
of
them,
just
for
her.
mr.
william
terry
bray
she
might
report
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
she
must
report
her
share
of
the
community
income.
mr.
william
terry
bray
this
is
of
course
the
practical
difficulty
with
which
we’re
faced
in
this
court.
mr.
william
terry
bray
i
beg
your
pardon,
the
practical
difficulty
of
the
wife
which
we
must
answer
in
this
court
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
under
a
state
law,
there
is
the
possibility
that
she
could
compel
her
husband
to
give
her
this
information.
frankly,
i
know
of
no
case
under
louisiana
law
for
that
matter
under
any
other
community
property
state
law
which
would
give
her
this
right.
but
on
the
other
hand,
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
no,
it
would
not
be
a
complete
compliance.
now,
with
regards
to
your
specific
question,
certainly,
she
could
i
think
protect
herself
from
penalties
in
that
situation.
by
filing
a
separate
return
and
reporting
all
that
she
knew
about,
she
would
not
be
subject
to
any
penalties.
on
the
other
hand,
i
think
it
follows
from
the
existing
state
of
a
law
that
she
would
still
be
liable
for
the
tax
in
statutory
interest
on
the
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
even
though
it
was
practically
impossible,
yes
sir.
now,
again,
this
special
situation
if
indeed
it
is
a
problem
and
we
would
recognize
that
it
is
can
be
handled
in
one
of
two
fashions.
one
would
be
amending
the
present
internal
revenue
code.
this
of
course
has
been
done
quite
recently
in
a
situation
whereas
joint
returns
have
been
found.
in
that
situation,
the
recent
amendments
that
came
into
being
in
january
of
this
year
lets
the
wife
or
relieves
the
wife
of
liability
if
she
in
fact
is
completely
innocent
and
has
done
everything
she
can
to
comply
with
the
requirements
of
law.
mr.
william
terry
bray
well,
not
only
fraud
but
also
from
the
tax
liability.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes,
sir
it
does.
but,
let
me
emphasize
this,
that
statute
presently
applies
only
where
a
joint
return
has
been
found
and
thus
both
spouses
are
jointly
and
severally
liable
for
the
entire
tax.
now,
this
highlights
the
problem
we’re
faced
with
here
under
existing
law
as
we
interpreted,
the
husband
is
not
liable
for
the
taxes
on
the
wife’s
share
of
community
income.
thus,
only
the
wife,
thus
we
may
presently
only
go
after
the
wife.
if
indeed,
similar
legislation
is
presented
to
relieve
an
innocent
spouse
in
a
community
property
state
from
liability
on
his
or
her
one-half
share
of
community
income
of
which
he
or
she
knows
nothing,
then
we
would
hope
that
congress
would
impose
liability
on
the
guilty
spouse
with
respect
to
those
taxes.
otherwise,
half
the
income
will
escape
taxation
under
the
present
state
of
the
law.
now,
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
terry
bray
absolutely,
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
that’s
right
and
let
me
say
that
in
that
regard,
while
the
present
legislation
has
relieved
the
wife
of
liability
in
certain
very
limited
circumstances,
there
are
two
important
features
of
that.
first
of
all,
the
legislation
we
feel
was
absolutely
necessary
notwithstanding
some
cases
to
the
contrary
to
bring
about
the
change
in
the
law,
that
is
relieving
the
wife
of
liability.
secondly,
i
would
point
out
that
again
historically
under
spanish
law,
the
wife
has
not
been
deemed
the
one-half
owner
of
fraudulently
obtained
funds.
so
that
the
situation
against
or
to
which
the
amending
statute
is
specifically
directed.
that
is
where
the
husband
has
fraudulently
obtained
funds
and
the
wife
knows
nothing
about
this
would
not
under
the
historical
approach
of
the
community
property
law
be
a
problem
in
community
property
states
because
the
wife
doesn’t
own
any
part
of
that
fraudulently
obtained
income.
but
to
answer
your
question
as
directly
as
i
can,
yes
the
situation
would
be
identical
in
the
common
law
states.
mr.
william
terry
bray
no,
in
the
community
property
state?
mr.
william
terry
bray
if
a
joint
return
has
been
filed
in
some,
yes.
mr.
william
terry
bray
until
the
amendments
of
the
statute
in
january
of
this
year.
mr.
william
terry
bray
that’s
right.
they
were
jointly
and
severally
liable
for
all
taxes
both
those
reported
and
those
found
to
be
due
upon
subsequent
audit.
mr.
william
terry
bray
absolutely.
now,
i
think
again,
this
serves
to
highlight
the
problem
here.
the
problem
is
not
one
of
our
making
but
rather
one
of
the
community
property
laws.
historically,
the
community
property
laws
have
provided
community
property
husbands
and
wives
with
some
rather
significant
advantages.
before
of
the
day
of
the
joint
return
and
i
might
add
that
the
joint
return
came
into
being
essentially
because
of
these
advantages.
before
the
day
of
the
joint
return,
the
spouses
could
split
their
income,
report
it
separately
and
thus
avoid
or
at
least
lessen
the
impact
of
the
graduating
income
tax.
when
this
court
held
in
the
1930
term
upheld
the
right
of
the
spouses
to
do
this
in
the
series
of
cases
are
found
in
poe
versus
seaborn,
the
advantages
were
very
clear
cut
and
the
court
established
at
that
time
that
taxation
follows
ownership
in
so
far
as
the
individual
taxpayers
concern.
we
think
that
that
compels
the
position
which
we
take
here
that
the
wife
owns
her
share
and
she
must
pay
taxes
on
it.
and
i
might
add
that
since
1930,
that
has
been
a
whole
basis
of
the
taxation
of
individuals
in
the
federal
income
tax
code.
that
is
its
tax
the
income
to
its
individuals
and
this
has
been
repeatedly
recognized
and
the
congress
has
acted
on
this
understanding
of
the
law.
indeed,
the
recent
amendments
serve
to
emphasize
this
once
more,
in
those
amendments
or
rather
in
the
legislative
history
of
it.
the
congressional
reports
indicate
that
except
for
the
amendment,
congress
recognized
that
in
the
community
property
state,
the
wife
would
be
deemed
the
owner
of
one-half
of
all
community
income
and
would
have
to
report
and
pay
tax
on
it.
and
because
of
that,
the
congress
inserted
in
this
amendment
amending
statute
a
provision
relieving
the
wife
of
liability
in
the
joint
return
situation
or
where
she
otherwise
would
have
that
liability
not
just
because
she
signed
the
joint
return
but
because
she
own
the
income.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes
sir,
he
was
and
he
dissented
from
the
decision
in
both
of
these
cases.
mr.
william
terry
bray
well,
i’m
sorry,
i
think
(voice
overlap).
mr.
william
terry
bray
judge
ainsworth.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes,
you’re
correct.
i
am
sorry.
mr.
william
terry
bray
no.
no,
specific
comment
on
it
other
than
the
fact
that
we
view
the
decision
as
wrongly
grounded
and
one
which
is
in
complete
conflict
with
this
court’s
decisions.
mr.
william
terry
bray
that’s
correct
and
it
continued
to
do
so,
i
might
add.
mr.
william
terry
bray
mr.
justice
marshall,
if
i
can
say
that
we
don’t
charge
her
with
possessing
something.
the
state
law
says
that
she
owns
that
income
regardless
under
our
view,
the
federal
law
is
quite
clear
it
taxes
income
to
its
owner.
we
don’t
have
any
control
over
who
is
the
owner
that
is
a
matter
determined
under
state
law.
mr.
william
terry
bray
she
is
the
owner
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
well
that
--
this
court
again
in
poe
versus
seaborn
distinguished
between
management
on
the
one
hand
which
we
acknowledged
that
the
husband
have.
mr.
william
terry
bray
and
bear
ownership
on
the
other
and
i
might
add
that
in
a
subsequent
dissent,
mr.
justice
douglas
pointed
out
that
this
was
the
technical
distinction
made
and
that
now,
ownership
determines
who
is
liable
for
the
taxes.
as
i’ve
indicated
both
state
and
federal
law
is
important
for
the
question
before
this
court.
the
state
law
creates
the
legal
interest
involved
while
the
federal
statute
taxes
those
interests.
in
our
view,
it
is
clear
that
the
federal
statute
taxes
income
to
the
individual
who
owns
it.
this
was
decided
in
the
1930
series
of
cases
and
has
been
bedrock
with
respect
to
subsequent
revenue
legislation.
we
don’t
see
anyway
around
this
at
this
point
in
time.
now,
with
respect
with
to
the
state
law,
we
think
it’s
equally
clear
that
the
wife
owns
her
undivided
one-half
share
of
the
community
income
and
we
don’t
think
there’s
any
real
dispute
either
with
respect
to
the
respondents
or
for
that
matter
with
respect
to
the
fifth
circuit
on
this
particular
topic.
indeed,
the
fifth
circuit
said
in
its
opinion
that
under
the
louisiana
law,
the
wife
has
a
present
vested
ownership
interest
in
one-half
for
the
community
property
including
its
income.
the
court
could
only
say
this
following
not
only
the
decisions
--
the
many
decisions
of
the
louisiana
supreme
court
so
stating
but
also
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
bender
versus
pfaff
and
in
fernandez
versus
weiner
so
holding.
but
the
court
went
on
to
say,
it
rejected
what
we
say
must
follow
that
is
that
the
wife
must
report
and
pay
taxes
on
her
half
by
saying
that
under
louisiana
law,
the
wife’s
interest
in
the
community
is
of
such
a
character
that
she
is
not
personally
liable
out
of
her
separate
property
for
the
tax
of
her
share.
we
think
in
this
regard,
the
court
confused
collection
of
the
tax
which
state
law
does
provide
protections
that
would
ordinarily
protect
the
wife
from
community
creditors.
and
imposition
of
the
tax,
which
we
think
is
truly
the
issue
here
involved.
the
fifth
circuit
rested
its
decision
--
its
decision
that
the
wife’s
ownership
interest
was
qualified
sufficiently
that
she
could
not
be
held
responsible
for
the
taxes
on
her
share
essentially
on
two
grounds.
first,
on
the
ground
that
the
husband
had
very
broad
management
rights
over
the
wife’s
community
property
not
only
over
his
but
also
over
the
wife’s.
and
secondly,
that
the
wife’s
property
was
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
that
the
wife’s
separate
property
was
generally
protected
from
community
creditors.
however,
under
the
state
law,
again
as
that
law
has
been
recognized
in
this
court.
these
two
features
of
state
law
simply
are
ineffective
in
so
far
as
protecting
the
wife
from
the
taxation
that
is
listed
upon
her
because
she
owns
the
income.
they
do
not
--
these
features
do
not
owe
to
the
fact
that
she
owned
that
right
her
share
of
the
income.
and
we
think
that
she
must
report
and
pay
her
share
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
the
tax
on
her
share
of
the
income
based
on
this
court’s
decisions
in
the
1930
split
income
tax
cases.
admittedly,
these
cases
did
not
bring
before
the
court
the
question
of
whether
the
wife
is
required
to
report
it,
but
rather
only
whether
she
was
entitled
to
do
so.
but
we
think
a
case
decided
along
with
these
cases
in
that
same
session
of
the
court
made
clear
that
not
only
may
she
do
so
but
she
must
to
do
so
where
the
spouses
have
not
otherwise
reported
their
income
on
a
joint
return.
this
is
the
decision
in
united
states
versus
malcolm.
malcolm
was
decided
some
five
years
after
an
earlier
supreme
court
decision
in
united
state
versus
robbins.
in
robbins,
this
court
had
decided
that
in
california
at
any
rate,
the
husband
must
report
and
pay
taxes
on
all
of
the
community
income.
in
robbins,
the
court
based
its
decision
on
two
grounds.
primarily,
on
the
holdings
of
the
supreme
court
of
california
that
the
wife’s
interest
in
community
property
during
the
existence
of
the
community
was
merely
an
expectancy,
she
had
no
present
vested
interest
in
the
community
income.
alternatively,
the
court
bounded
its
decision
on
the
fact
that
the
husband
had
such
broad
management
powers
that
this
would
entitle
congress
to
tax
all
of
the
income
to
him.
in
recognition
of
this
decision,
california
subsequently
amended
its
laws
and
stated
unequivocally
that
the
wife’s
interest
in
the
community
during
the
existence
of
the
community
was
a
present
existing
interest
equal
to
that
of
the
husband.
following
this
amendment
and
the
statutes
were
not
amended
significantly
with
respect
to
the
husband’s
management
powers,
he
still
manage
his
wife’s
share
of
the
community.
but
following
the
amendment
with
respect
to
the
vested
interest
versus
expectancy
interest,
malcolm
versus
united
states
came
before
this
court
and
in
a
per
curiam
opinion
based
upon
the
court’s
split
income
decisions
in
poe
versus
seaborn
and
the
other
cases.
the
court
held
that
under
the
federal
statutes,
the
husband
need
no
longer,
the
california
husband
need
no
longer
report
and
pay
taxes
on
all
of
the
community
income
in
california.
they
further
held
that
the
wife’s
interest
under
state
law
were
such
but
she
should
and
i
use
the
word
“should”
because
that
was
the
question
posed
to
the
court
that
she
should
report
and
pay
the
taxes
on
her
share.
we
think
that
this
makes
clear
the
position
that
we’re
here
taking
and
indeed
every
court
up
until
the
fifth
circuit’s
decision
is
here
who
has
considered
this
question
has
so
held.
now,
in
doing
so,
we
would
suggest
the
court
abandoned
the
management
ground
on
which
robbins
had
alternatively
based
the
decision
to
tax
the
husband
on
all
of
the
community
income.
the
court
instead
opted
in
favor
of
ownership
--
bear
legal
ownership
and
made
clear
that
management
is
not
the
touchstone
under
the
code
rather
ownership
is
the
key
and
whoever
is
the
owner
must
pay
the
taxes.
i
might
point
out
that
this
is
not
unlike
the
situation
in
several
other
areas
of
the
tax
law.
specifically,
the
partnership
area,
the
wife’s
interest
has
been
compared
by
the
louisiana
courts
to
that
of
a
limited
partner
and
a
limited
partnership
just
as
unlimited
partner
must
pay
taxes
on
his
share
of
partnership
income
so
the
wife
must.
and
this,
mind
you
whether
or
not
the
partner
is
around
at
the
time
the
partnership
returned
and
the
individual
returns
should
be
filed
and
whether
or
not
the
partner
has
ever
made
distributions
of
the
partnership
income.
thus,
if
the
partner
absconds
with
all
of
the
partnership
funds
this
does
not
relieve
the
limited
partner
in
any
respect
from
his
obligation
to
pay
federal
income
taxes
on
his
share
of
the
partnership
income.
similarly,
in
the
situation
where
a
grantor
creates
a
trust
and
because
he
is
also
the
beneficiary
of
the
trust,
he
is
taxed
on
its
income.
if
the
trustee
absconds
with
all
of
the
trusts
income,
the
grantor
beneficiary
would
not
be
relieved
of
his
obligation
to
pay
taxes
on
the
trust
income.
thus,
we
can
see
no
reason
to
suggest
that
taxing
the
wife
on
the
share
of
her
income
is
unconstitutional
as
a
violation
of
the
fifth
or
fourteenth
amendments.
there
is
just
no
basis
for
this
as
far
as
we
can
tell.
we
have
been
able
to
find
no
cases
suggesting
that
this
would
be
such
an
unfair
and
invidious
tax
system
of
taxation
as
to
render
it
unconstitutional
and
we
note
that
while
our
opponents
suggested
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
they
do
not
either
cite
any
authority
for
this
proposition.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes
sir,
it
does.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes
sir,
i
am.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes
sir,
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
terry
bray
alright,
not
under
that
provision
but
prenuptially
the
parties
may
determine
not
to
be
bound
by
the
community
property
laws
under
article
2399,
which
provides
that
absent
on
agreement,
the
marriage
super
induces
a
partnership
of
right
between
the
spouses
“unless,
they
otherwise
agree.”
and
it’s
clear
i
think
under
louisiana
law
that
they
can
otherwise
agree,
but
to
enunciate
the
article
2410,
if
i’m
not
mistaken
does
not
go
specifically
to
prenuptial
arrangements
rather
only
to
dissolution.
mr.
william
terry
bray
no,
we
don’t
but
i
might
add
that
the
fifth
circuit
didn’t
base
its
decision
on
renunciation
per
se.
the
angello
case
makes
this
quite
clear
as
thus
the
subsequent
ramos
case,
which
comes
out
of
texas.
in
angello,
there
was
no
form
of
renunciation.
there,
the
husband
died
and
the
wife
merely
--
there’s
no
evidence
that
she
got
anything
from
the
community
that
previously
existed
between
the
spouses.
she
did
not
formally
renounce
her
interest
in
the
community
under
article
2410.
ramos
as
i
say,
comes
out
of
texas
and
there,
there
is
no
renunciation.
however,
in
both
angello
and
ramos,
the
fifth
circuit
based
on
its
mitchell
holding
found
that
because
the
spouse
--
the
wife
had
not
received
any
benefits
from
the
community
and
had
not
expressly
agreed
to
be
bound
by
her
share,
on
her
share
of
the
taxes.
she
could
not
be
made
the
pay
that
share
of
the
taxes.
if
the
court
accepts
what
we
think
is
the
clear
law,
one
that
the
wife
is
the
owner
of
the
tax
and
two,
that
as
the
owner,
she
must
report
and
pay
the
taxes
on
it.
i
beg
your
pardon,
one,
that
the
wife
is
the
owner
of
her
share
of
the
income
and
two,
as
the
owner,
she
must
report
and
pay
the
taxes
on
it.
then,
we
think
it
follows
that
the
government
is
entitled
to
collect
those
taxes
from
any
property
she
has.
including
after
acquired
separate
property
such
as,
is
in
involved
in
these
cases.
i
don’t
understand
the
respondents
to
seriously
object
to
our
propositions
in
this
regard
which
we
have
set
out
fully
in
our
brief.
rather,
their
objection
just
as
the
fifth
circuit’s
opinion
is
to
whether
or
not
the
wife’s
ownership
is
sufficient
to
impose
the
tax
against
her
in
the
first
instance.
if
indeed,
she
--
the
tax
is
imposed
against
her
and
she
owns
it
then
it’s
clear
that
the
federal
collection
statutes
prevail
over
state
exemption
laws
and
entitle
us
to
collect
the
tax
for
many
property
that
she
owns
except
there’s
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
unfortunately,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
we
can’t
claim
the
equities
in
this
case
and
we
recognize
that
only
too
well,
but
we
come
here
because
we
think
the
law
is
clear
and
has
been
for
some
40
years
now.
ever
since,
the
split
income
cases
and
that
law
is
that
in
the
individual
tax
herein
--
the
individual
who
owns
the
income
must
report
and
pay
the
taxes
on
it.
further,
if
we
have
a
means
of
going
at
to
the
husband,
this
might
not
be
quite
so
much
of
concern
to
us,
but
under
the
existing
state
of
the
law,
as
i’ve
explained,
we
can’t
go
after
the
husband.
again,
we
think
the
malcolm
case
and
the
cases
that
have
come
along
since
it
make
that
very
clear.
mr.
william
terry
bray
not
on
this
subject,
i
don’t
believe
we
would,
but
i
might
point
out
that
of
course
the
wife
as
i
mentioned
earlier
realizes
some
rather
significant
benefits
under
the
community
property
laws
which
she
doesn’t
have
in
the
common
law
states.
those
benefits
were
before
the
court
in
the
split
income
cases
and
this
is
merely
the
other
side
of
the
coin
from
state
law.
now,
of
course
the
state
can
change
its
law
just
as
congress
could
amend
the
revenue
statutes
with
respect
to
these
specific
hardship
areas.
indeed,
my
understanding
of
california
law
is
that
there,
if
the
husband
abandons
the
wife,
the
income
which
she
subsequently
owns
which
is
the
ramos
case
is
his
separate
income
and
the
wife
has
no
interest
--
no
ownership
interest
in
that.
and
thus,
would
not
be
obligated
to
report
and
pay
taxes
on
it.
there’s
nothing
to
preclude,
i
presume
louisiana
from
doing
the
same
where
that
the
--
and
that’s
truly
the
hardship
case
more
so
and
i
think
than
arms
where
the
wife
was
residing
with
the
husband
and
indeed
in
all
probability
shared
with
him
whatever
earnings
he
had.
and
today
is
where
all,
the
wife
does
indeed
spend
quite
a
bit
of
the
income
which
even
her
husband
makes
and
i
think
it’s
only
realistic
to
recognize
that.
but
in
the
area
where
that
mr.
justice
white
deposited
where
she
has
no
knowledge
of
what’s
going
and
can’t
because
her
husband
has
abandoned
her
for
instance.
then
there’s
nothing
to
suggest
that
louisiana
couldn’t
modify
its
laws
to
say
in
that
circumstance
the
husband
owns
that
right,
his
income
and
the
wife
has
no
interest
in
it.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes
sir,
i
did.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes
sir,
it
is.
mr.
william
terry
bray
presuming
that
the
funds
there
were
legally
obtained
and
i
presume
that
they
were.
mr.
william
terry
bray
and
i
understand
that
to
be
legal.
mr.
william
terry
bray
then
indeed,
it
would
follow
under
--
what
we
consider
to
be
the
established
law
that
she
must
report
and
pay
the
taxes
on
her
one-half
share
of
that
$100,000.00
if
a
joint
return
or
her
husband’s
separate
return
has
not
included
that
income
earning.
mr.
william
terry
bray
there’s
no
way
i
can
get
around
that,
yes.
mr.
william
terry
bray
except
as
i
try
to
say
in
the
embezzlement
area,
historically
at
any
right
to
community
property
law
has
not
recognized
the
wife
as
the
one-half
owner
of
moneys
illegally
obtained
by
her
husband.
thus,
we
would
not
be
faced,
i
don’t
think
in
the
community
property
state
with
quite
the
same
problem
in
the
embezzlement
area.
now,
i
might
add
that
it’s
for
this
very
reason
that
congress
so
fit
to
amend
the
provisions
of
the
internal
revenue
code
this
january
to
relieve
the
wife
of
liability
in
this
hardship
case.
and
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
not
in
this
one,
i’m
sorry.
in
the
hardship
case
where
the
husband
has
illegally
obtained
money
or
otherwise
fraudulently
misled
the
wife
into
accepting
joint
in
several
liability
on
a
joint
return.
and
the
court
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
and
the
congress
there
again
confirm
its
understanding
that
income
is
taxed
to
its
owner
and
that
in
the
community
property
states,
the
wife
is
the
owner
and
thus
is
the
tax
payer
of
her
share.
and
we
of
course
would
have
no
objection
whatsoever
to
the
congress
doing
the
same
for
hardship
cases
in
community
property
states
where
no
return
is
filed
if
they
can
also
devise
if
congress
can
also
devise
a
means
for
imposing
liability
against
the
husband
in
that
circumstance.
i
would
like
if
i
may
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
he
never
knew
he
had?
mr.
william
terry
bray
well,
again
i
would
presume
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
i
would
presume
that
a
limited
partner
might
not
know
what
he
had.
mr.
william
terry
bray
i
would
also
presume
that
a
beneficiary
of
a
trust
might
not
know
what
the
trustee
is
doing.
again,
in
the
second
instance
presuming
a
rather
significant
appreciation,
there’s
no
reason
why
the
trustee
couldn’t
sell
the
property
and
leave
with
the
appreciation
then
being
recognized
but
the
tax
is
not
under
the
partner.
mr.
william
terry
bray
exactly.
and
that
is
the
whole
basis
of
the
individual
taxation
portions
of
the
code.
mr.
william
terry
bray
well,
certainly
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
but
mr.
justice
white,
i
might
add
that
this
would
of
course
be
after
the
fact
just
like
it
is
in
our
case
or
in
the
hypothetically
any
rate
would
be.
the
wife
in
our
case
has
after
the
fact
remedies
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
but
she
has
after
the
fact
remedies
and
she
would
certainly
find
out
at
the
time
the
government
find
out
and
made
an
assessment
against
her
just
as
the
wife
here
did.
mr.
william
terry
bray
she
can
sue
the
husband
for
--
now,
i’m
not
as
clear
on
louisiana
law
on
this
as
i
am
on
california
law
because
of
the
recent
case.
mr.
william
terry
bray
okay,
it
would
be
my
understanding
that
louisiana
law
is
identical
to
california
law
on
this
subject
and
that
is
that
the
wife
has
a
right
over
against
her
husband
for
his
failure
to
pay
community
debts
when
he
should
have.
that
is
exactly
what
comes
says
and
that
is
what
i
believe
the
messersmith
louisiana
supreme
court
decision
suggests
that
the
husband
is
primarily
liable
on
community
obligations
if
he
does
not
pay
those
obligations,
the
wife
would
have
a
claim
over
against
him.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes.
that
would
be
my
understanding
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
under
louisiana
law
now
again
presuming
limitations
or
something
else
doesn’t
bar
him
from
going
after.
of
course
in
angello
the
husband
is
dead
and
the
record
would
indicate
that
the
estate
is
himself.
but
under
state
law
she
does
have
a
remedy
against
her
husband
if
he
fails
to
pay
the
community
obligation
that
is
the
tax
is
on
the
community
income.
but,
let
me
emphasize
that
unlike
the
suggestion
in
the
fifth
circuit
below,
the
community
simply
is
not
a
tax
paying
entity
just
as
the
partnership
and
the
trustee
is
not
rather
it’s
merely
a
flow-through
device.
the
individual
spouse
is
under
local
law.
it’s
very
clear
own
individually
their
interest
in
the
community
property
and
its
income
and
thus
are
required
to
report
and
pay
the
taxes
on
it.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
reserve
whatever
time
i
have
left
rebuttal.
mr.
william
terry
bray
thank
you.
i
would
like
to
respond
to
four
or
five
items
brought
out
in
the
argument.
first,
it’s
our
position
that
the
federal
statute
at
this
point
in
time
is
very
clear
that
it
taxes
income
to
the
owner
and
that
this
is
been
the
law
since
this
court
handed
down
its
decisions
in
the
1930
term
in
split
income
cases.
thus,
the
inquiry
under
state
law
is
who
is
the
owner
and
we
think
the
law
of
louisiana
is
equally
clear
that
the
wife
owns
her
one-half
share
of
the
income
and
thus
it
follows
that
she
must
report
and
pay
the
taxes
on
it.
the
taxpayer’s
arguments
essentially
are
that
the
various
state
law
rights
to
which
they
refer
so
qualify
the
wife’s
ownership
that
she
can’t
be
obligated
to
pay
the
tax
that
the
ownership
does
not
rise
to
the
level
which
the
federal
statutes
tax.
listening
to
that
argument,
it
duplicates
almost
verbatim
of
the
government’s
brief
in
the
poe
versus
seaborn
cases.
all
of
these
arguments
were
made
by
the
government
in
the
1930
cases
in
support
of
their
position
that
the
husband
must
report
and
pay
taxes
on
all
of
the
community
income.
we
argued
there
that
he
was
the
in
fact
owner
of
all
the
income
because
of
his
practical
powers,
management
powers
albeit
over
that
income
and
of
course
not
only
did
we
argue
his
management
powers
but
we
also
pointed
to
the
wife’s
protections
under
state
law,
specifically
her
renunciation
power.
and
we
argued
in
our
brief
that
this
renunciation
power
was
inconsistent
with
the
wife
being
a
sufficient
“owner”
to
entitle
her
separately
to
report
and
pay
taxes.
notwithstanding
our
arguments,
the
court
very
clearly
held
and
this
contrary
to
the
assertions
of
respondents
that
the
income
is
tax
to
the
owner.
it
did
not
tax
it
to
the
community
as
an
entity
but
rather
to
the
owner
and
found
that
individual
spouses
each
of
them
owned
their
respective
shares
of
the
community
income.
this
was
the
very
clear
holding
not
only
in
poe
versus
seaborn,
the
washington
case
but
also
in
the
louisiana
case
where
the
court
said,
if
the
test
to
be
as
we
have
held
that
it
is
ownership
then
the
louisiana
case
is
probably
the
strongest
of
those
presented
to
us
in
favor
of
the
wife’s
ownership
of
one-half
of
that
income.
it
went
on
of
course
to
hold
that
because
she
was
the
owner,
she
was
entitled
separately
to
report
it
and
pay
taxes
on
it.
the
wife
indeed
has
protections
under
state
law
but
these
protections
do
not
affect
her
basic
ownership
right.
they
are
outlined
in
the
weiner
opinion
to
which
we
refer
on
page
10
of
our
brief
in
support
of
the
court’s
decision
there,
the
louisiana
supreme
court’s
decision
there
showing
that
the
husband’s
management
powers
are
not
so
extensive
as
to
destroy
the
wife’s
ownership.
these
protections
indeed
limit
the
husband’s
powers.
the
husband
not
only
has
these
rights
with
respect
to
management
but
has
a
duty
to
manage
the
community
property
for
the
benefit
of
the
community.
so
that
duties
go
along
with
the
rights.
i
might
add
that
the
provision
of
louisiana
law
dealing
with
separation
of
property
without
dissolving
a
marriage,
provide
not
only
for
the
separation
of
property
where
the
wife’s,
i
beg
your
pardon
--
where
the
husband’s
activities
endanger
the
wife’s
separate
property
but
go
on
to
say
or
win
the
disorder
of
his
affairs
induces
her
to
believe
that
his
estate
may
not
be
sufficient
to
meet
her
rights
and
claims.
and
of
course
it’s
our
position
that
one
of
her
rights
and
claims
would
be
the
right
to
receive
her
share
of
community
property
upon
dissolution
of
the
community.
and
thus,
if
the
husband
was
furthering
away
the
community
income,
obviously
this
would
be
--
entitle
her
to
a
separation
of
property
under
louisiana
civil
code.
with
respect
to
the
right
of
renunciation,
let
me
say
that
this
of
course
occurs
only
after
the
community
is
dissolved
and
as
in
the
cases
here
long
after
the
tax
years
in
which
income
is
realized.
at
the
very
moment,
the
income
is
realized
and
this
is
the
clear
law
of
louisiana.
the
wife
owns
her
share
of
that
income,
it
would
certainly
be
an
unusual
and
in
fact
unique
in
the
tax
law
if
many
years
later
because
of
some
act
she
took
with
respect
to
the
state’s
definition
of
creditor’s
rights
she
could
remove
the
liability
which
otherwise
is
imposed
on
her
by
the
federal
taxing
statutes
for
her
tax
on
her
share
of
the
income.
now,
let
me
emphasize
too
that
the
decision
below
opens
up
also
many
non-hardship
cases
or
at
least
it
poses
a
problem
in
such
cases.
under
that
decision,
there
is
nothing
to
keep
why
is
now
from
just
not
reporting
their
share
of
income
and
to
the
husband
filing
a
separate
return
and
paying
the
tax
on
his
half
of
the
community
income.
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
we
think
malcolm
in
contrast
to
our
respondents
is
quite
clear
that
we
cannot
collect
the
wife’s
taxes
from
the
husband.
thus,
the
taxes
on
her
share
would
escape
taxation
under
the
decision
below.
let
me
mention
that
perhaps
judge
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
because
the
wife
has
no
obligation
on
the
husband’s
--
on
the
taxes
on
the
husband’s
share
of
the
income.
mr.
william
terry
bray
well,
certainly
with
respect
--
yes
to
answer
that
directly
yes.
it’s
not
her
taxes
and
just
as
it’s
not
his
taxes
and
thus
we
can’t
collect
her
taxes
from
the
husband.
mr.
william
terry
bray
each
spouse
is
then
jointly
and
severally
liable
and
we
can
go
after
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
we
can
and
go
after
either
or
both
of
them
for
all
of
the
taxes
and
from
any
property
they
may
own
community
or
separate
and
of
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
that’s
a
matter
of
federal
collection,
your
honor.
mr.
william
terry
bray
that’s
correct,
i
think
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
that’s
correct
and
i
think
the
best
case
makes
very
clear
that
in
that
situation
we’re
not
bound
by
a
state
exemption
laws.
mr.
william
terry
bray
but
the
characterization
of
the
wife’s
ownership
is
something
less
than
sufficient
for
federal
tax
purposes
is
simply
not
with
this
court
has
recognized
or
what
the
louisiana
courts
have
held
time
and
again.
and
this
may
explain
judge
ainsworth
joining
in
the
majority
opinion
here.
perhaps,
she
was
too
influenced
by
the
parochial
views
of
louisiana
law
having
been
a
louisiana
lawyer
for
many,
many
years
and
he
failed
to
see
that
the
federal
law
taxes
the
owner
and
the
state
law
in
louisiana
makes
the
wife
the
owner.
the
other
peculiar
taste
of
that
law
do
not
diminish
in
any
regard
her
ownership
and
this
regard
the
case
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
can
she
sell
it?
mr.
william
terry
bray
alright,
she
has
no
right
to
convey
the
property
during
the
existence
of
the
community.
i
know
of
no
reason
why
she
couldn’t
assign
whatever
rights
she
might
have
at
such
time
as
those
rights
can
be.
mr.
william
terry
bray
no,
sir.
not
in
terms
of
conveyances.
now,
i
might
answer
that
by
saying
that
the
husband’s
right
of
conveyance
are
restrictive
wherever
the
wife’s
name
is
own
community
property.
he
can’t
convey
without
her
consent.
so,
in
that
regard
his
rights
of
conveyance
are
restricted
too.
mr.
william
terry
bray
thank
you.
mr.
william
terry
bray
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
these
combined
income
taxes
cases
are
here
on
certiorari
to
the
fifth
circuit.
they
involved
the
louisiana
community
property
system.
in
each
case,
a
husband
and
wife
living
in
louisiana
realized
community
income
of
which
each
own
one-half
under
the
louisiana
law.
no
federal
income
tax
returns
were
filed
by
either
spouse,
either
separately
or
jointly.
the
marriages
were
subsequently
dissolved
and
the
government
separately
assessed
each
wife
for
the
income
taxes
on
her
share
of
the
realized
but
unreported
community
income.
the
cases
present
a
single
question
whether
where
no
returns
have
been
filed
a
louisiana
wife
must
report
and
pay
the
federal
income
taxes
on
the
one-half
share
of
community
income
which
under
the
laws
of
that
state
she
owns.
in
each
of
these
cases,
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
she
need
not
do
so
where
she
neither
expressly
accepts
liability
for
those
taxes
nor
receives
any
benefits
from
the
community
property
upon
the
dissolution
of
the
community.
we
believe
that
in
doing
so,
that
court
failed
to
perceive
an
important
distinction.
one
which
we
feel
underlies
the
decision
in
this
case,
that
is
the
distinction
between
imposition
of
the
tax
on
one
hand
and
collection
of
the
tax
from
the
individual
owing
it
on
the
other.
mr.
william
terry
bray
in
the
mitchell
case,
it
was
partially
due
to
her
earnings.
in
the
angello
case,
the
record
indicates
that
all
of
the
community
income
was
due
to
the
husband’s
earnings.
in
neither
case,
was
any
significant
amount
of
income
due
to
the
wife’s
individual
separate
efforts.
this
however,
we
do
not
believe
determines
the
case
since
regardless
of
who
generates
the
income,
under
the
louisiana
law,
each
spouse
owns
an
undivided
one-half
interest
of
it
from
the
very
moment
it
comes
into
being.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes,
sir
and
even
before
that,
the
split
income
cases
in
the
1930
term
of
this
court.
to
that,
we
think
those
cases
decide
this
case
and
compel
the
result
for
which
we
here
content.
our
position
is
that
this
case
involves
only
the
imposition
of
the
tax
and
that
because
the
wife
owns
her
share
of
community
income,
she
is
tax
on
it.
while
we
recognize
that
our
position
may
result
in
hardships
in
certain
instances
to
why
as
residing
in
community
property
states.
yet,
we
think
the
law
is
clear
and
compels
the
position
that
we
take.
at
least
as
the
statutory
law
presently
exist.
in
some,
we
argue
that
it
is
now
and
for
many
years
prior
to
this
well
established
that
the
federal
statutes
imposed
the
tax
against
the
owner
of
the
income.
that
under
louisiana
law,
the
wife
owns
outright
her
one-half
interest
in
community
income
as
of
the
very
moment
that
it
comes
into
existence.
and
that
it
follows
that
she
must
report
and
pay
taxes
on
her
half.
on
the
other
hand,
as
regards
to
the
collection
of
these
taxes,
we
think
there
is
no
real
dispute
on
our
position
here.
the
state
laws
exempting
the
louisiana
wife
from
community
obligations
and
we
would
here
acknowledge
that
taxes
--
federal
income
taxes,
all
community
income
are
indeed
a
community
obligation.
but
these
state
laws
exonerating
the
wife
from
the
community
obligation
simply
are
ineffective
as
against
the
united
states
in
its
efforts
to
collect
the
tax
from
the
individual
owing
it.
the
dispute
here
really
is
whether
the
wife’s
ownership
of
her
community
income
--
her
share
of
community
income
is
sufficient
under
the
federal
statutes
for
that
statute
to
impose
the
tax
against
her
and
compel
her
to
return
it
and
pay
tax
on
it.
mr.
william
terry
bray
it
is
not,
it
was
common
in
the
spanish
law.
it
arose
under
the
spanish
law,
but
as
far
as
we
can
tell,
louisiana
is
the
only
state
which
has
carried
this
over
from
the
spanish
law.
i
might
point
out
in
that
regard
that
even
under
the
spanish
law,
it
was
very
clear
that
during
the
existence
of
the
marriage
the
wife
owned
that
right
her
half
of
community
income.
the
renunciation
provision
was
merely
one
designed
to
protect
her
from
community
creditors.
again,
community
creditor
or
rather
a
creditor
right
type
of
proposition
which
gave
her
the
right
upon
determination
of
the
marriage
to
forego
her
otherwise
vested
interest
in
the
community
income
and
for
that
matter,
all
community
property,
and
similarly
to
be
relieve
of
any
obligations
all
community
debts.
mr.
william
terry
bray
that’s
correct,
in
fact
in
these
cases,
one
dissolution
occurred
because
of
death.
mr.
william
terry
bray
no,
the
husband
does
not
and
this
is
because
again
originating
from
the
spanish
law.
the
husband
has
the
management
generally
speaking
of
the
community
property.
it
was
therefore
thought
that
because
he
manages
the
property,
he
ought
to
be
responsible
for
the
community
debts
regardless.
and
indeed,
historically,
not
only
was
he
responsible
in
the
sense
that
the
community
property
was
responsible
for
the
debts,
but
he
personally
was
responsible
for
those
community
debts.
in
other
words,
if
the
community
was
not
sufficient
to
take
care
of
the
community
debts,
he
had
to
come
out
of
his
own
separate
property
to
pay
those
debts.
mr.
william
terry
bray
well,
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes,
that
is
part
of
a
theory,
but
i
would
point
out
that
there
are
protections
for
the
wife
while
she
can’t
perhaps
compel
the
husband
to
pay
the
taxes
as
such.
yet,
she
does
have
protections
under
state
law
which
are
very
clearly
spelled
out
not
only
in
the
state
law
cases,
but
for
that
manner
in
the
two
cases
in
which
this
court
has
dealt
with
louisiana
community
property.
bender
versus
pfaff,
the
split
income
case
and
fernandez
versus
wiener,
the
state
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
the
federal
state
tax
case
and
in
both
instances
it
was
noted
that
while
the
husband
had
management
rights
over
her
half
of
community
property
nevertheless,
that
she
had
some
rather
special
provisions
of
state
law
which
protected
her
interest
in
that
property,
including
the
right
to
separate
her
property
from
her
husband’s
without
terminating
the
marriage
and
from
that
point
forward
to
have
complete
control
over
her
property.
mr.
william
terry
bray
as
a
practical
matter,
if
indeed
the
husband
is
unavailable,
she
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
no,
not
for
both
of
them,
just
for
her.
mr.
william
terry
bray
she
might
report
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
she
must
report
her
share
of
the
community
income.
mr.
william
terry
bray
this
is
of
course
the
practical
difficulty
with
which
we’re
faced
in
this
court.
mr.
william
terry
bray
i
beg
your
pardon,
the
practical
difficulty
of
the
wife
which
we
must
answer
in
this
court
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
under
a
state
law,
there
is
the
possibility
that
she
could
compel
her
husband
to
give
her
this
information.
frankly,
i
know
of
no
case
under
louisiana
law
for
that
matter
under
any
other
community
property
state
law
which
would
give
her
this
right.
but
on
the
other
hand,
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
no,
it
would
not
be
a
complete
compliance.
now,
with
regards
to
your
specific
question,
certainly,
she
could
i
think
protect
herself
from
penalties
in
that
situation.
by
filing
a
separate
return
and
reporting
all
that
she
knew
about,
she
would
not
be
subject
to
any
penalties.
on
the
other
hand,
i
think
it
follows
from
the
existing
state
of
a
law
that
she
would
still
be
liable
for
the
tax
in
statutory
interest
on
the
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
even
though
it
was
practically
impossible,
yes
sir.
now,
again,
this
special
situation
if
indeed
it
is
a
problem
and
we
would
recognize
that
it
is
can
be
handled
in
one
of
two
fashions.
one
would
be
amending
the
present
internal
revenue
code.
this
of
course
has
been
done
quite
recently
in
a
situation
whereas
joint
returns
have
been
found.
in
that
situation,
the
recent
amendments
that
came
into
being
in
january
of
this
year
lets
the
wife
or
relieves
the
wife
of
liability
if
she
in
fact
is
completely
innocent
and
has
done
everything
she
can
to
comply
with
the
requirements
of
law.
mr.
william
terry
bray
well,
not
only
fraud
but
also
from
the
tax
liability.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes,
sir
it
does.
but,
let
me
emphasize
this,
that
statute
presently
applies
only
where
a
joint
return
has
been
found
and
thus
both
spouses
are
jointly
and
severally
liable
for
the
entire
tax.
now,
this
highlights
the
problem
we’re
faced
with
here
under
existing
law
as
we
interpreted,
the
husband
is
not
liable
for
the
taxes
on
the
wife’s
share
of
community
income.
thus,
only
the
wife,
thus
we
may
presently
only
go
after
the
wife.
if
indeed,
similar
legislation
is
presented
to
relieve
an
innocent
spouse
in
a
community
property
state
from
liability
on
his
or
her
one-half
share
of
community
income
of
which
he
or
she
knows
nothing,
then
we
would
hope
that
congress
would
impose
liability
on
the
guilty
spouse
with
respect
to
those
taxes.
otherwise,
half
the
income
will
escape
taxation
under
the
present
state
of
the
law.
now,
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
terry
bray
absolutely,
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
that’s
right
and
let
me
say
that
in
that
regard,
while
the
present
legislation
has
relieved
the
wife
of
liability
in
certain
very
limited
circumstances,
there
are
two
important
features
of
that.
first
of
all,
the
legislation
we
feel
was
absolutely
necessary
notwithstanding
some
cases
to
the
contrary
to
bring
about
the
change
in
the
law,
that
is
relieving
the
wife
of
liability.
secondly,
i
would
point
out
that
again
historically
under
spanish
law,
the
wife
has
not
been
deemed
the
one-half
owner
of
fraudulently
obtained
funds.
so
that
the
situation
against
or
to
which
the
amending
statute
is
specifically
directed.
that
is
where
the
husband
has
fraudulently
obtained
funds
and
the
wife
knows
nothing
about
this
would
not
under
the
historical
approach
of
the
community
property
law
be
a
problem
in
community
property
states
because
the
wife
doesn’t
own
any
part
of
that
fraudulently
obtained
income.
but
to
answer
your
question
as
directly
as
i
can,
yes
the
situation
would
be
identical
in
the
common
law
states.
mr.
william
terry
bray
no,
in
the
community
property
state?
mr.
william
terry
bray
if
a
joint
return
has
been
filed
in
some,
yes.
mr.
william
terry
bray
until
the
amendments
of
the
statute
in
january
of
this
year.
mr.
william
terry
bray
that’s
right.
they
were
jointly
and
severally
liable
for
all
taxes
both
those
reported
and
those
found
to
be
due
upon
subsequent
audit.
mr.
william
terry
bray
absolutely.
now,
i
think
again,
this
serves
to
highlight
the
problem
here.
the
problem
is
not
one
of
our
making
but
rather
one
of
the
community
property
laws.
historically,
the
community
property
laws
have
provided
community
property
husbands
and
wives
with
some
rather
significant
advantages.
before
of
the
day
of
the
joint
return
and
i
might
add
that
the
joint
return
came
into
being
essentially
because
of
these
advantages.
before
the
day
of
the
joint
return,
the
spouses
could
split
their
income,
report
it
separately
and
thus
avoid
or
at
least
lessen
the
impact
of
the
graduating
income
tax.
when
this
court
held
in
the
1930
term
upheld
the
right
of
the
spouses
to
do
this
in
the
series
of
cases
are
found
in
poe
versus
seaborn,
the
advantages
were
very
clear
cut
and
the
court
established
at
that
time
that
taxation
follows
ownership
in
so
far
as
the
individual
taxpayers
concern.
we
think
that
that
compels
the
position
which
we
take
here
that
the
wife
owns
her
share
and
she
must
pay
taxes
on
it.
and
i
might
add
that
since
1930,
that
has
been
a
whole
basis
of
the
taxation
of
individuals
in
the
federal
income
tax
code.
that
is
its
tax
the
income
to
its
individuals
and
this
has
been
repeatedly
recognized
and
the
congress
has
acted
on
this
understanding
of
the
law.
indeed,
the
recent
amendments
serve
to
emphasize
this
once
more,
in
those
amendments
or
rather
in
the
legislative
history
of
it.
the
congressional
reports
indicate
that
except
for
the
amendment,
congress
recognized
that
in
the
community
property
state,
the
wife
would
be
deemed
the
owner
of
one-half
of
all
community
income
and
would
have
to
report
and
pay
tax
on
it.
and
because
of
that,
the
congress
inserted
in
this
amendment
amending
statute
a
provision
relieving
the
wife
of
liability
in
the
joint
return
situation
or
where
she
otherwise
would
have
that
liability
not
just
because
she
signed
the
joint
return
but
because
she
own
the
income.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes
sir,
he
was
and
he
dissented
from
the
decision
in
both
of
these
cases.
mr.
william
terry
bray
well,
i’m
sorry,
i
think
(voice
overlap).
mr.
william
terry
bray
judge
ainsworth.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes,
you’re
correct.
i
am
sorry.
mr.
william
terry
bray
no.
no,
specific
comment
on
it
other
than
the
fact
that
we
view
the
decision
as
wrongly
grounded
and
one
which
is
in
complete
conflict
with
this
court’s
decisions.
mr.
william
terry
bray
that’s
correct
and
it
continued
to
do
so,
i
might
add.
mr.
william
terry
bray
mr.
justice
marshall,
if
i
can
say
that
we
don’t
charge
her
with
possessing
something.
the
state
law
says
that
she
owns
that
income
regardless
under
our
view,
the
federal
law
is
quite
clear
it
taxes
income
to
its
owner.
we
don’t
have
any
control
over
who
is
the
owner
that
is
a
matter
determined
under
state
law.
mr.
william
terry
bray
she
is
the
owner
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
well
that
--
this
court
again
in
poe
versus
seaborn
distinguished
between
management
on
the
one
hand
which
we
acknowledged
that
the
husband
have.
mr.
william
terry
bray
and
bear
ownership
on
the
other
and
i
might
add
that
in
a
subsequent
dissent,
mr.
justice
douglas
pointed
out
that
this
was
the
technical
distinction
made
and
that
now,
ownership
determines
who
is
liable
for
the
taxes.
as
i’ve
indicated
both
state
and
federal
law
is
important
for
the
question
before
this
court.
the
state
law
creates
the
legal
interest
involved
while
the
federal
statute
taxes
those
interests.
in
our
view,
it
is
clear
that
the
federal
statute
taxes
income
to
the
individual
who
owns
it.
this
was
decided
in
the
1930
series
of
cases
and
has
been
bedrock
with
respect
to
subsequent
revenue
legislation.
we
don’t
see
anyway
around
this
at
this
point
in
time.
now,
with
respect
with
to
the
state
law,
we
think
it’s
equally
clear
that
the
wife
owns
her
undivided
one-half
share
of
the
community
income
and
we
don’t
think
there’s
any
real
dispute
either
with
respect
to
the
respondents
or
for
that
matter
with
respect
to
the
fifth
circuit
on
this
particular
topic.
indeed,
the
fifth
circuit
said
in
its
opinion
that
under
the
louisiana
law,
the
wife
has
a
present
vested
ownership
interest
in
one-half
for
the
community
property
including
its
income.
the
court
could
only
say
this
following
not
only
the
decisions
--
the
many
decisions
of
the
louisiana
supreme
court
so
stating
but
also
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
bender
versus
pfaff
and
in
fernandez
versus
weiner
so
holding.
but
the
court
went
on
to
say,
it
rejected
what
we
say
must
follow
that
is
that
the
wife
must
report
and
pay
taxes
on
her
half
by
saying
that
under
louisiana
law,
the
wife’s
interest
in
the
community
is
of
such
a
character
that
she
is
not
personally
liable
out
of
her
separate
property
for
the
tax
of
her
share.
we
think
in
this
regard,
the
court
confused
collection
of
the
tax
which
state
law
does
provide
protections
that
would
ordinarily
protect
the
wife
from
community
creditors.
and
imposition
of
the
tax,
which
we
think
is
truly
the
issue
here
involved.
the
fifth
circuit
rested
its
decision
--
its
decision
that
the
wife’s
ownership
interest
was
qualified
sufficiently
that
she
could
not
be
held
responsible
for
the
taxes
on
her
share
essentially
on
two
grounds.
first,
on
the
ground
that
the
husband
had
very
broad
management
rights
over
the
wife’s
community
property
not
only
over
his
but
also
over
the
wife’s.
and
secondly,
that
the
wife’s
property
was
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
that
the
wife’s
separate
property
was
generally
protected
from
community
creditors.
however,
under
the
state
law,
again
as
that
law
has
been
recognized
in
this
court.
these
two
features
of
state
law
simply
are
ineffective
in
so
far
as
protecting
the
wife
from
the
taxation
that
is
listed
upon
her
because
she
owns
the
income.
they
do
not
--
these
features
do
not
owe
to
the
fact
that
she
owned
that
right
her
share
of
the
income.
and
we
think
that
she
must
report
and
pay
her
share
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
the
tax
on
her
share
of
the
income
based
on
this
court’s
decisions
in
the
1930
split
income
tax
cases.
admittedly,
these
cases
did
not
bring
before
the
court
the
question
of
whether
the
wife
is
required
to
report
it,
but
rather
only
whether
she
was
entitled
to
do
so.
but
we
think
a
case
decided
along
with
these
cases
in
that
same
session
of
the
court
made
clear
that
not
only
may
she
do
so
but
she
must
to
do
so
where
the
spouses
have
not
otherwise
reported
their
income
on
a
joint
return.
this
is
the
decision
in
united
states
versus
malcolm.
malcolm
was
decided
some
five
years
after
an
earlier
supreme
court
decision
in
united
state
versus
robbins.
in
robbins,
this
court
had
decided
that
in
california
at
any
rate,
the
husband
must
report
and
pay
taxes
on
all
of
the
community
income.
in
robbins,
the
court
based
its
decision
on
two
grounds.
primarily,
on
the
holdings
of
the
supreme
court
of
california
that
the
wife’s
interest
in
community
property
during
the
existence
of
the
community
was
merely
an
expectancy,
she
had
no
present
vested
interest
in
the
community
income.
alternatively,
the
court
bounded
its
decision
on
the
fact
that
the
husband
had
such
broad
management
powers
that
this
would
entitle
congress
to
tax
all
of
the
income
to
him.
in
recognition
of
this
decision,
california
subsequently
amended
its
laws
and
stated
unequivocally
that
the
wife’s
interest
in
the
community
during
the
existence
of
the
community
was
a
present
existing
interest
equal
to
that
of
the
husband.
following
this
amendment
and
the
statutes
were
not
amended
significantly
with
respect
to
the
husband’s
management
powers,
he
still
manage
his
wife’s
share
of
the
community.
but
following
the
amendment
with
respect
to
the
vested
interest
versus
expectancy
interest,
malcolm
versus
united
states
came
before
this
court
and
in
a
per
curiam
opinion
based
upon
the
court’s
split
income
decisions
in
poe
versus
seaborn
and
the
other
cases.
the
court
held
that
under
the
federal
statutes,
the
husband
need
no
longer,
the
california
husband
need
no
longer
report
and
pay
taxes
on
all
of
the
community
income
in
california.
they
further
held
that
the
wife’s
interest
under
state
law
were
such
but
she
should
and
i
use
the
word
“should”
because
that
was
the
question
posed
to
the
court
that
she
should
report
and
pay
the
taxes
on
her
share.
we
think
that
this
makes
clear
the
position
that
we’re
here
taking
and
indeed
every
court
up
until
the
fifth
circuit’s
decision
is
here
who
has
considered
this
question
has
so
held.
now,
in
doing
so,
we
would
suggest
the
court
abandoned
the
management
ground
on
which
robbins
had
alternatively
based
the
decision
to
tax
the
husband
on
all
of
the
community
income.
the
court
instead
opted
in
favor
of
ownership
--
bear
legal
ownership
and
made
clear
that
management
is
not
the
touchstone
under
the
code
rather
ownership
is
the
key
and
whoever
is
the
owner
must
pay
the
taxes.
i
might
point
out
that
this
is
not
unlike
the
situation
in
several
other
areas
of
the
tax
law.
specifically,
the
partnership
area,
the
wife’s
interest
has
been
compared
by
the
louisiana
courts
to
that
of
a
limited
partner
and
a
limited
partnership
just
as
unlimited
partner
must
pay
taxes
on
his
share
of
partnership
income
so
the
wife
must.
and
this,
mind
you
whether
or
not
the
partner
is
around
at
the
time
the
partnership
returned
and
the
individual
returns
should
be
filed
and
whether
or
not
the
partner
has
ever
made
distributions
of
the
partnership
income.
thus,
if
the
partner
absconds
with
all
of
the
partnership
funds
this
does
not
relieve
the
limited
partner
in
any
respect
from
his
obligation
to
pay
federal
income
taxes
on
his
share
of
the
partnership
income.
similarly,
in
the
situation
where
a
grantor
creates
a
trust
and
because
he
is
also
the
beneficiary
of
the
trust,
he
is
taxed
on
its
income.
if
the
trustee
absconds
with
all
of
the
trusts
income,
the
grantor
beneficiary
would
not
be
relieved
of
his
obligation
to
pay
taxes
on
the
trust
income.
thus,
we
can
see
no
reason
to
suggest
that
taxing
the
wife
on
the
share
of
her
income
is
unconstitutional
as
a
violation
of
the
fifth
or
fourteenth
amendments.
there
is
just
no
basis
for
this
as
far
as
we
can
tell.
we
have
been
able
to
find
no
cases
suggesting
that
this
would
be
such
an
unfair
and
invidious
tax
system
of
taxation
as
to
render
it
unconstitutional
and
we
note
that
while
our
opponents
suggested
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
they
do
not
either
cite
any
authority
for
this
proposition.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes
sir,
it
does.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes
sir,
i
am.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes
sir,
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
terry
bray
alright,
not
under
that
provision
but
prenuptially
the
parties
may
determine
not
to
be
bound
by
the
community
property
laws
under
article
2399,
which
provides
that
absent
on
agreement,
the
marriage
super
induces
a
partnership
of
right
between
the
spouses
“unless,
they
otherwise
agree.”
and
it’s
clear
i
think
under
louisiana
law
that
they
can
otherwise
agree,
but
to
enunciate
the
article
2410,
if
i’m
not
mistaken
does
not
go
specifically
to
prenuptial
arrangements
rather
only
to
dissolution.
mr.
william
terry
bray
no,
we
don’t
but
i
might
add
that
the
fifth
circuit
didn’t
base
its
decision
on
renunciation
per
se.
the
angello
case
makes
this
quite
clear
as
thus
the
subsequent
ramos
case,
which
comes
out
of
texas.
in
angello,
there
was
no
form
of
renunciation.
there,
the
husband
died
and
the
wife
merely
--
there’s
no
evidence
that
she
got
anything
from
the
community
that
previously
existed
between
the
spouses.
she
did
not
formally
renounce
her
interest
in
the
community
under
article
2410.
ramos
as
i
say,
comes
out
of
texas
and
there,
there
is
no
renunciation.
however,
in
both
angello
and
ramos,
the
fifth
circuit
based
on
its
mitchell
holding
found
that
because
the
spouse
--
the
wife
had
not
received
any
benefits
from
the
community
and
had
not
expressly
agreed
to
be
bound
by
her
share,
on
her
share
of
the
taxes.
she
could
not
be
made
the
pay
that
share
of
the
taxes.
if
the
court
accepts
what
we
think
is
the
clear
law,
one
that
the
wife
is
the
owner
of
the
tax
and
two,
that
as
the
owner,
she
must
report
and
pay
the
taxes
on
it.
i
beg
your
pardon,
one,
that
the
wife
is
the
owner
of
her
share
of
the
income
and
two,
as
the
owner,
she
must
report
and
pay
the
taxes
on
it.
then,
we
think
it
follows
that
the
government
is
entitled
to
collect
those
taxes
from
any
property
she
has.
including
after
acquired
separate
property
such
as,
is
in
involved
in
these
cases.
i
don’t
understand
the
respondents
to
seriously
object
to
our
propositions
in
this
regard
which
we
have
set
out
fully
in
our
brief.
rather,
their
objection
just
as
the
fifth
circuit’s
opinion
is
to
whether
or
not
the
wife’s
ownership
is
sufficient
to
impose
the
tax
against
her
in
the
first
instance.
if
indeed,
she
--
the
tax
is
imposed
against
her
and
she
owns
it
then
it’s
clear
that
the
federal
collection
statutes
prevail
over
state
exemption
laws
and
entitle
us
to
collect
the
tax
for
many
property
that
she
owns
except
there’s
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
unfortunately,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
we
can’t
claim
the
equities
in
this
case
and
we
recognize
that
only
too
well,
but
we
come
here
because
we
think
the
law
is
clear
and
has
been
for
some
40
years
now.
ever
since,
the
split
income
cases
and
that
law
is
that
in
the
individual
tax
herein
--
the
individual
who
owns
the
income
must
report
and
pay
the
taxes
on
it.
further,
if
we
have
a
means
of
going
at
to
the
husband,
this
might
not
be
quite
so
much
of
concern
to
us,
but
under
the
existing
state
of
the
law,
as
i’ve
explained,
we
can’t
go
after
the
husband.
again,
we
think
the
malcolm
case
and
the
cases
that
have
come
along
since
it
make
that
very
clear.
mr.
william
terry
bray
not
on
this
subject,
i
don’t
believe
we
would,
but
i
might
point
out
that
of
course
the
wife
as
i
mentioned
earlier
realizes
some
rather
significant
benefits
under
the
community
property
laws
which
she
doesn’t
have
in
the
common
law
states.
those
benefits
were
before
the
court
in
the
split
income
cases
and
this
is
merely
the
other
side
of
the
coin
from
state
law.
now,
of
course
the
state
can
change
its
law
just
as
congress
could
amend
the
revenue
statutes
with
respect
to
these
specific
hardship
areas.
indeed,
my
understanding
of
california
law
is
that
there,
if
the
husband
abandons
the
wife,
the
income
which
she
subsequently
owns
which
is
the
ramos
case
is
his
separate
income
and
the
wife
has
no
interest
--
no
ownership
interest
in
that.
and
thus,
would
not
be
obligated
to
report
and
pay
taxes
on
it.
there’s
nothing
to
preclude,
i
presume
louisiana
from
doing
the
same
where
that
the
--
and
that’s
truly
the
hardship
case
more
so
and
i
think
than
arms
where
the
wife
was
residing
with
the
husband
and
indeed
in
all
probability
shared
with
him
whatever
earnings
he
had.
and
today
is
where
all,
the
wife
does
indeed
spend
quite
a
bit
of
the
income
which
even
her
husband
makes
and
i
think
it’s
only
realistic
to
recognize
that.
but
in
the
area
where
that
mr.
justice
white
deposited
where
she
has
no
knowledge
of
what’s
going
and
can’t
because
her
husband
has
abandoned
her
for
instance.
then
there’s
nothing
to
suggest
that
louisiana
couldn’t
modify
its
laws
to
say
in
that
circumstance
the
husband
owns
that
right,
his
income
and
the
wife
has
no
interest
in
it.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes
sir,
i
did.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes
sir,
it
is.
mr.
william
terry
bray
presuming
that
the
funds
there
were
legally
obtained
and
i
presume
that
they
were.
mr.
william
terry
bray
and
i
understand
that
to
be
legal.
mr.
william
terry
bray
then
indeed,
it
would
follow
under
--
what
we
consider
to
be
the
established
law
that
she
must
report
and
pay
the
taxes
on
her
one-half
share
of
that
$100,000.00
if
a
joint
return
or
her
husband’s
separate
return
has
not
included
that
income
earning.
mr.
william
terry
bray
there’s
no
way
i
can
get
around
that,
yes.
mr.
william
terry
bray
except
as
i
try
to
say
in
the
embezzlement
area,
historically
at
any
right
to
community
property
law
has
not
recognized
the
wife
as
the
one-half
owner
of
moneys
illegally
obtained
by
her
husband.
thus,
we
would
not
be
faced,
i
don’t
think
in
the
community
property
state
with
quite
the
same
problem
in
the
embezzlement
area.
now,
i
might
add
that
it’s
for
this
very
reason
that
congress
so
fit
to
amend
the
provisions
of
the
internal
revenue
code
this
january
to
relieve
the
wife
of
liability
in
this
hardship
case.
and
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
not
in
this
one,
i’m
sorry.
in
the
hardship
case
where
the
husband
has
illegally
obtained
money
or
otherwise
fraudulently
misled
the
wife
into
accepting
joint
in
several
liability
on
a
joint
return.
and
the
court
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
and
the
congress
there
again
confirm
its
understanding
that
income
is
taxed
to
its
owner
and
that
in
the
community
property
states,
the
wife
is
the
owner
and
thus
is
the
tax
payer
of
her
share.
and
we
of
course
would
have
no
objection
whatsoever
to
the
congress
doing
the
same
for
hardship
cases
in
community
property
states
where
no
return
is
filed
if
they
can
also
devise
if
congress
can
also
devise
a
means
for
imposing
liability
against
the
husband
in
that
circumstance.
i
would
like
if
i
may
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
he
never
knew
he
had?
mr.
william
terry
bray
well,
again
i
would
presume
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
i
would
presume
that
a
limited
partner
might
not
know
what
he
had.
mr.
william
terry
bray
i
would
also
presume
that
a
beneficiary
of
a
trust
might
not
know
what
the
trustee
is
doing.
again,
in
the
second
instance
presuming
a
rather
significant
appreciation,
there’s
no
reason
why
the
trustee
couldn’t
sell
the
property
and
leave
with
the
appreciation
then
being
recognized
but
the
tax
is
not
under
the
partner.
mr.
william
terry
bray
exactly.
and
that
is
the
whole
basis
of
the
individual
taxation
portions
of
the
code.
mr.
william
terry
bray
well,
certainly
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
but
mr.
justice
white,
i
might
add
that
this
would
of
course
be
after
the
fact
just
like
it
is
in
our
case
or
in
the
hypothetically
any
rate
would
be.
the
wife
in
our
case
has
after
the
fact
remedies
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
but
she
has
after
the
fact
remedies
and
she
would
certainly
find
out
at
the
time
the
government
find
out
and
made
an
assessment
against
her
just
as
the
wife
here
did.
mr.
william
terry
bray
she
can
sue
the
husband
for
--
now,
i’m
not
as
clear
on
louisiana
law
on
this
as
i
am
on
california
law
because
of
the
recent
case.
mr.
william
terry
bray
okay,
it
would
be
my
understanding
that
louisiana
law
is
identical
to
california
law
on
this
subject
and
that
is
that
the
wife
has
a
right
over
against
her
husband
for
his
failure
to
pay
community
debts
when
he
should
have.
that
is
exactly
what
comes
says
and
that
is
what
i
believe
the
messersmith
louisiana
supreme
court
decision
suggests
that
the
husband
is
primarily
liable
on
community
obligations
if
he
does
not
pay
those
obligations,
the
wife
would
have
a
claim
over
against
him.
mr.
william
terry
bray
yes.
that
would
be
my
understanding
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
under
louisiana
law
now
again
presuming
limitations
or
something
else
doesn’t
bar
him
from
going
after.
of
course
in
angello
the
husband
is
dead
and
the
record
would
indicate
that
the
estate
is
himself.
but
under
state
law
she
does
have
a
remedy
against
her
husband
if
he
fails
to
pay
the
community
obligation
that
is
the
tax
is
on
the
community
income.
but,
let
me
emphasize
that
unlike
the
suggestion
in
the
fifth
circuit
below,
the
community
simply
is
not
a
tax
paying
entity
just
as
the
partnership
and
the
trustee
is
not
rather
it’s
merely
a
flow-through
device.
the
individual
spouse
is
under
local
law.
it’s
very
clear
own
individually
their
interest
in
the
community
property
and
its
income
and
thus
are
required
to
report
and
pay
the
taxes
on
it.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
reserve
whatever
time
i
have
left
rebuttal.
mr.
william
terry
bray
thank
you.
i
would
like
to
respond
to
four
or
five
items
brought
out
in
the
argument.
first,
it’s
our
position
that
the
federal
statute
at
this
point
in
time
is
very
clear
that
it
taxes
income
to
the
owner
and
that
this
is
been
the
law
since
this
court
handed
down
its
decisions
in
the
1930
term
in
split
income
cases.
thus,
the
inquiry
under
state
law
is
who
is
the
owner
and
we
think
the
law
of
louisiana
is
equally
clear
that
the
wife
owns
her
one-half
share
of
the
income
and
thus
it
follows
that
she
must
report
and
pay
the
taxes
on
it.
the
taxpayer’s
arguments
essentially
are
that
the
various
state
law
rights
to
which
they
refer
so
qualify
the
wife’s
ownership
that
she
can’t
be
obligated
to
pay
the
tax
that
the
ownership
does
not
rise
to
the
level
which
the
federal
statutes
tax.
listening
to
that
argument,
it
duplicates
almost
verbatim
of
the
government’s
brief
in
the
poe
versus
seaborn
cases.
all
of
these
arguments
were
made
by
the
government
in
the
1930
cases
in
support
of
their
position
that
the
husband
must
report
and
pay
taxes
on
all
of
the
community
income.
we
argued
there
that
he
was
the
in
fact
owner
of
all
the
income
because
of
his
practical
powers,
management
powers
albeit
over
that
income
and
of
course
not
only
did
we
argue
his
management
powers
but
we
also
pointed
to
the
wife’s
protections
under
state
law,
specifically
her
renunciation
power.
and
we
argued
in
our
brief
that
this
renunciation
power
was
inconsistent
with
the
wife
being
a
sufficient
“owner”
to
entitle
her
separately
to
report
and
pay
taxes.
notwithstanding
our
arguments,
the
court
very
clearly
held
and
this
contrary
to
the
assertions
of
respondents
that
the
income
is
tax
to
the
owner.
it
did
not
tax
it
to
the
community
as
an
entity
but
rather
to
the
owner
and
found
that
individual
spouses
each
of
them
owned
their
respective
shares
of
the
community
income.
this
was
the
very
clear
holding
not
only
in
poe
versus
seaborn,
the
washington
case
but
also
in
the
louisiana
case
where
the
court
said,
if
the
test
to
be
as
we
have
held
that
it
is
ownership
then
the
louisiana
case
is
probably
the
strongest
of
those
presented
to
us
in
favor
of
the
wife’s
ownership
of
one-half
of
that
income.
it
went
on
of
course
to
hold
that
because
she
was
the
owner,
she
was
entitled
separately
to
report
it
and
pay
taxes
on
it.
the
wife
indeed
has
protections
under
state
law
but
these
protections
do
not
affect
her
basic
ownership
right.
they
are
outlined
in
the
weiner
opinion
to
which
we
refer
on
page
10
of
our
brief
in
support
of
the
court’s
decision
there,
the
louisiana
supreme
court’s
decision
there
showing
that
the
husband’s
management
powers
are
not
so
extensive
as
to
destroy
the
wife’s
ownership.
these
protections
indeed
limit
the
husband’s
powers.
the
husband
not
only
has
these
rights
with
respect
to
management
but
has
a
duty
to
manage
the
community
property
for
the
benefit
of
the
community.
so
that
duties
go
along
with
the
rights.
i
might
add
that
the
provision
of
louisiana
law
dealing
with
separation
of
property
without
dissolving
a
marriage,
provide
not
only
for
the
separation
of
property
where
the
wife’s,
i
beg
your
pardon
--
where
the
husband’s
activities
endanger
the
wife’s
separate
property
but
go
on
to
say
or
win
the
disorder
of
his
affairs
induces
her
to
believe
that
his
estate
may
not
be
sufficient
to
meet
her
rights
and
claims.
and
of
course
it’s
our
position
that
one
of
her
rights
and
claims
would
be
the
right
to
receive
her
share
of
community
property
upon
dissolution
of
the
community.
and
thus,
if
the
husband
was
furthering
away
the
community
income,
obviously
this
would
be
--
entitle
her
to
a
separation
of
property
under
louisiana
civil
code.
with
respect
to
the
right
of
renunciation,
let
me
say
that
this
of
course
occurs
only
after
the
community
is
dissolved
and
as
in
the
cases
here
long
after
the
tax
years
in
which
income
is
realized.
at
the
very
moment,
the
income
is
realized
and
this
is
the
clear
law
of
louisiana.
the
wife
owns
her
share
of
that
income,
it
would
certainly
be
an
unusual
and
in
fact
unique
in
the
tax
law
if
many
years
later
because
of
some
act
she
took
with
respect
to
the
state’s
definition
of
creditor’s
rights
she
could
remove
the
liability
which
otherwise
is
imposed
on
her
by
the
federal
taxing
statutes
for
her
tax
on
her
share
of
the
income.
now,
let
me
emphasize
too
that
the
decision
below
opens
up
also
many
non-hardship
cases
or
at
least
it
poses
a
problem
in
such
cases.
under
that
decision,
there
is
nothing
to
keep
why
is
now
from
just
not
reporting
their
share
of
income
and
to
the
husband
filing
a
separate
return
and
paying
the
tax
on
his
half
of
the
community
income.
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
we
think
malcolm
in
contrast
to
our
respondents
is
quite
clear
that
we
cannot
collect
the
wife’s
taxes
from
the
husband.
thus,
the
taxes
on
her
share
would
escape
taxation
under
the
decision
below.
let
me
mention
that
perhaps
judge
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
because
the
wife
has
no
obligation
on
the
husband’s
--
on
the
taxes
on
the
husband’s
share
of
the
income.
mr.
william
terry
bray
well,
certainly
with
respect
--
yes
to
answer
that
directly
yes.
it’s
not
her
taxes
and
just
as
it’s
not
his
taxes
and
thus
we
can’t
collect
her
taxes
from
the
husband.
mr.
william
terry
bray
each
spouse
is
then
jointly
and
severally
liable
and
we
can
go
after
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
we
can
and
go
after
either
or
both
of
them
for
all
of
the
taxes
and
from
any
property
they
may
own
community
or
separate
and
of
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
that’s
a
matter
of
federal
collection,
your
honor.
mr.
william
terry
bray
that’s
correct,
i
think
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
that’s
correct
and
i
think
the
best
case
makes
very
clear
that
in
that
situation
we’re
not
bound
by
a
state
exemption
laws.
mr.
william
terry
bray
but
the
characterization
of
the
wife’s
ownership
is
something
less
than
sufficient
for
federal
tax
purposes
is
simply
not
with
this
court
has
recognized
or
what
the
louisiana
courts
have
held
time
and
again.
and
this
may
explain
judge
ainsworth
joining
in
the
majority
opinion
here.
perhaps,
she
was
too
influenced
by
the
parochial
views
of
louisiana
law
having
been
a
louisiana
lawyer
for
many,
many
years
and
he
failed
to
see
that
the
federal
law
taxes
the
owner
and
the
state
law
in
louisiana
makes
the
wife
the
owner.
the
other
peculiar
taste
of
that
law
do
not
diminish
in
any
regard
her
ownership
and
this
regard
the
case
--
mr.
william
terry
bray
can
she
sell
it?
mr.
william
terry
bray
alright,
she
has
no
right
to
convey
the
property
during
the
existence
of
the
community.
i
know
of
no
reason
why
she
couldn’t
assign
whatever
rights
she
might
have
at
such
time
as
those
rights
can
be.
mr.
william
terry
bray
no,
sir.
not
in
terms
of
conveyances.
now,
i
might
answer
that
by
saying
that
the
husband’s
right
of
conveyance
are
restrictive
wherever
the
wife’s
name
is
own
community
property.
he
can’t
convey
without
her
consent.
so,
in
that
regard
his
rights
of
conveyance
are
restricted
too.
mr.
william
terry
bray
thank
you.
