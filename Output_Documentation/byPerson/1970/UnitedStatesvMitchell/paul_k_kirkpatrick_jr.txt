mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
court
has
said
that
individuals
who
have
command
over
income
may
be
taxed
on
that
income
even
though
they
do
not
have
title
to
it.
we
ask
this
court
to
hold
that
the
respondent
mrs.
anne
goyne
mitchell
that
it
cannot
be
taxed
on
income
--
community
income
which
she
just
said
she
owns
but
over
which
she
has
no
command.
we
ask
this
because
to
interpret
section
1
of
the
code
which
taxes
income
of
individuals.
as
imposing
a
tax
on
her
would
make
it
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
her
and
secondly,
irrespective
the
constitutional
argument.
and
the
issue
in
section
1,
section
1
should
not
be
interpreted
as
imposing
a
tax
on
her
because
her
vested
interest
in
the
community
is
insufficient
to
cause
her
to
be
required
and
the
treat
that
the
income
of
that
community
as
her
own
income.
under
louisiana
--
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
it
does
your
honor.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
i
have
never
been
able
to
find
any
record
of
it
having
occurred,
made
it
inquires
with
the
state
revenue
people.
i
find
to
more
instance.
it
does
not
mean
they
aren’t
or
not.
under
the
community
proper
regime
of
louisiana,
the
wife
has
no
present
rights
to
deal
with
the
community.
during
the
existence
of
the
community
she
cannot
sell
the
property.
she
cannot
more
of
its
property.
she
cannot
obligate
the
community
in
her
own
right.
she
cannot
compel
an
accounting
from
her
husband
or
she
cannot
require
him
to
furnish
any
information
to
her.
he
has
complete
control
of
the
property.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
it
has
been
a
law
of
louisiana,
your
honor,
at
least
since
it
became
a
state
and
prior
thereto
under
the
spanish
and
french.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
i
do
disagree.
there
is
one
instance
at
which
she
can’t
ask
for
a
separation
of
property.
the
only
time
during
the
existence
of
community
--
the
community
can
terminate
at
death
or
divorce
or
separation
or
if
at
one
point
she
may
ask
for
a
termination
of
the
community.
that
is
when
his
mismanagement
of
the
community
is
endangering
her
separate
property.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
in
this
particular
situation,
your
honor
she
had
no
separate
property
at
the
point
that,
which
she
might
have
ask
for
termination
of
the
community.
but,
--
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
our
courts
have
held
that
if
the
result
of
his
squandering
the
community
funds,
is
to
make
her
support
put
in
jeopardy
and
that
she
is
working
she
might
get
a
termination
of
the
community
so
that
her
future
earnings
would
be
her
separate
property.
that
is
not
the
situation
your
honor.
she
could
not
show
that
she
was
not
being
supported
during
the
continuation
of
this
community.
it
was
after
this
community
--
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
our
courts
have
not
at
this
point
interpreted
support
that
broadly.
i
can’t
say
what
they
would
interpret
us
for,
but
it
intends
to
be
what
it
takes
to
subsist
food,
clothing,
shelter,
etcetera.
the
wife
herself
--
our
courts
would
treat
the
wife
as
agent
of
the
husband
if
she
would
go
buy
food,
but
when
you
get
much
pass
that,
you
get
into
the
great
controversy
as
to
whether
that
is
supported
or
not
in
our
state.
the
wife
--
the
husband
has
complete
control
of
community.
he
may
sell
the
property,
he
may
spend
the
money
virtually
as
he
pleases
but
he
may
spend
the
money
as
he
pleases.
he
--
subject
to
certain
restrictions,
he
can
make
gifts
of
the
community
property
to
others.
he
is
not
a
fiduciary
and
he
is
not
required
to
account
his
wife
during
the
course
of
the
community
or
thereafter
for
his
administration.
the
restrictions
upon
him
are
that
he
can
not
donate
the
immovables
or
a
quota
such
as
one-fourth,
one-half
of
the
movables
to
anyone
other
than
the
children
of
the
marriage.
if
he
may
give
a
sum
of
money
which
is
not
--
it’s
not
described
as
one-fourth
of
all
our
personal
property
to
anyone
he
chooses.
he
may
not
sell
property
which
has
been
designated
as
the
family
homestead
without
the
wife
joining
in
the
deed.
he
cannot
take
the
community
property
and
steal
it
so
to
speak
and
make
it
his
separate
property
and
--
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
he
can
sell
it
as
he
chooses,
he
can
sell
it
--
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
he
does
not
need
her
signature
at
all.
he
may
--
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
he
would
have
--
he
could
have
property
which
he
owned
before
marriage,
he
could
have
property
which
was
the
result
having
sold
that
property
and
reinvested
it
gives
an
inheritance.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
i’m
attacking
by
an
interpretation
of
section
1
of
the
code
as
imposing
a
tax
on
the
wife
in
community,
when
she
has
not
assume
that
liability
by
filing
return
or
accepting
the
community.
the
husband
may
not
fraudulently
dispose
of
the
community
with
the
intent
to
the
prior
the
wife
albeit.
we
contend
your
--
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
without
any
control
whatsoever.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
that
is
correct.
we
contend
that
in
term
section
1
of
code
as
imposing
a
tax
on
the
wife
violates
the
dues
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
because
it
is
arbitrary
and
unreasonable
and
that
she
has
no
control
and
it
has
no
--
and
the
husband
at
the
same
time
has
power
to
deny
her
the
property.
if
she
is
required
to
report,
it
is
legally
impossible
for
her
to
do
so
unless
her
husband
--
she
can
only
do
so
unless
her
husband
gives
her
the
information.
if
she
does
not
have
separate
property
and
he
will
not
advance
the
funds,
it
is
impossible
for
her
to
pay.
whether
or
not
she
pays
are
of
course
depends
upon
his
whim
and
we
contend
that
to
pay
to
require
her
to
pay
community
taxes
with
her
separate
funds
is
to
confiscate
her
separate
property.
but
section
1
does
not
require.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
your
honor,
when
you’re
comparing
a
wife
in
a
separate
property
state
who
have
signed
a
joint
return
and
made
herself
liable
by
signing
the
joint
return
she
made
it
possible
for
the
family
to
split
the
income,
that
the
congress
makes
her
liable,
makes
her
agreed
to
be
liable
for
all
the
taxes
by
virtue
of
signing
the
return.
now,
the
question
whether
fraudulently
income
--
money
is
income
or
not
and
this
court
has
decided
twice
and
at
this
moment
it
is
income.
i
doubt
seriously
that
we
can
avoid
taxation
to
the
wife
in
louisiana
because
our
state
law
said,
that
embezzle
money
was
not
the
property
of
the
community.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
i
don’t
understand,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
she
would
not
be
liable
at
all
if
she
had
not
filed
a
return.
she
was
not
required
to
file
a
return
and
she
would
not
be
liable
under
any
circumstances
had
she
not
filed
a
return.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
right,
yes
she
is
and
just
as
hard
part
of
the
position,
but
the
government
says
here,
“you
must
file
return.
you
don’t
have
a
choice
of
whether
to
file
a
return
and
be
liable
or
not
file
return
and
not
be
liable.”
the
government
says,
“here,
you
must
file
a
return
and
be
liable.”
i
think,
that
this
is
a
greater
--
the
greater
problem.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
that’s
correct
and
it’s
our
contention
that
it
is
not
her
income
that
section
1
of
the
code
when
it
imposes
the
tax
on
the
income
of
individuals
does
not
impose
the
tax
on
the
wife.
now,
the
argument
goes
that
since
she
has
a
vested
interest
in
the
community,
she
owns
a
community’s
income,
but
this
ignores
a
basic
fundamental
concept
of
community
property
law.
the
community
is
in
an
entity.
community
property
is
not
a
form
of
co-ownership,
co-tenancy.
the
community
property
is
the
property
of
the
community.
it
is
not
owned
one-half
by
one
and
one-half
by
the
other.
community
property
is
the
community
is
separate
from
the
husband
and
the
wife.
the
problem
is,
the
tax
problem
arises
from
the
fact
that
the
community
is
not
a
tax
paying
entity
and
--
or
define
an
individual
or
individuals
who
will
pay
its
tax,
the
community’s
income
must
be
attributed
to
some
person.
the
question
then
it
really
and
truly
is
not
whose
income
is
it,
but
to
whom
should
it
be
attributed
now,
poe
v.
seaborn,
did
not,
which
held
that
the
husband
and
wife
in
split
income
was
not
based
upon
the
concept
that
the
husband
and
the
wife
own
the
income.
it
was
based
upon
the
rational
that
neither
owned
it
and
sets
one
--
the
case
said,
that
the
opinion
said
that
it
could
not
be
said
that
one
owned
it
more
--
any
more
than
the
other.
and
as
a
result,
they
were
permitted
to
split
the
income,
but
that
is
not
the
same
thing
it
saying
that
one
owns
the
income
or
the
other
or
both
own
it.
mitchell
says,
that
seaborn
permitted
both
to
file
returns
and
split
the
income
that
this
is
a
--
that
the
whole
rational
of
seaborn
if
they
did
not
and
if
we
do
not
look
--
mitchell
said,
that
if
the
husband
and
wife
do
not
split
the
income
and
file
returns,
they
say,
if
they
do
the
wife
has
assumed
the
liability
by
virtue
of
filing
the
return
that
return.
why?
because
seaborn
said,
she
could
file
the
return.
but
if
they
did
not
split
the
income
and
file
returns
that
the
court
should
then
look
to
see
to
whom
should
the
income
be
attributed.
the
fifth
circuit
said,
“the
income
should
be
attributed
to
the
husband
because
he
had
control
of
the
property
and
because
to
treat
it
any
other
way
was
to
reap
up
the
community
property
law
unnecessarily
by
the
use
of
the
tax
law.”
it
said,
“the
husband
was
liable
for
the
debts
of
the
community,
that
this
was
by
its
nature
a
community
debt
and
the
husband
was
the
logical
person
to
pay
the
tax.”
mitchell
does
not
conflict
with
seaborn
unless,
that
the
import
of
seaborn
laws
that
the
husband
could
only
be
required
to
pay
on
one-half
or
that
the
wife
was
liable
for
one-half
of
the
tax
on
her
separate
property
without
regard
to
anything
else.
if
that
is
what
seaborn
meant
although
it
did
not
say
that,
we
suggest
that
this
court
should
overrule
seaborn
because
that
is
an
illogical
interpretation
of
section
1.
it
creates
an
unnecessary
problem
with
state
law
and
it
causes
the
collection
problems
that
the
government
complains
of
here.
it
is
unnecessary
for
this
court
to
overrule
seaborn,
to
affirm
mitchell.
but
if
this
--
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
seaborn
held
that
the
husband
and
wife
in
the
community
property
states
could
file
separate
returns
and
return
one-half
income
on
each.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
that
the
rational
of
seaborn
as
i
read
it
or
it
was
based
upon
two
rationales.
one
that
the
revenue
service
had
permitted
it
in
its
regulations
and
that
the
income
tax
law
had
been
reenacted
in
the
interim,
and
therefore
that
they
would
accept
administrative
construction.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
seaborn
was
ruling
on
washington
law
but
after
that
case,
it
was
quickly
followed
by
california,
arizona,
louisiana
and
texas
cases.
basically,
relying
on
seaborn.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
that
the
court
was
wrong
in
its
characterization
of
washington
community
property
law.
the
court
acknowledge
that
the
community
was
in
entity
and
--
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
your
honor?
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
that
the
ruling
was
on
the
state
law
that
the
court
found
that
the
wife
have
a
vested
interest
in
the
community.
that
is
the
entity
and
that
as
such
she
was
entitled
to
report
one-half
of
the
community
the
entity’s
income
as
her
own.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
whether
or
not
that
the
congress
has
the
power
to
require
state
to
adopt
other
than
the
community
property
system,
i
don’t
know.
but
i
do
contend
that
congress
--
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
well,
i
would
not
think
they
would,
but
i
do
not
think
if
congress
could
tax
--
if
congress
could
tax
the
income
of
the
community
to
one
or
the
other
of
the
husband
or
wife.
we
would
acknowledge
that
congress
can
tax
to
the
husband.
united
states
v.
robbins
said
that
it
could.
but
we
would
contend
that
they
cannot
tax
it
to
the
wife.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
i
say
that
if
this
court
does
say
that
seaborn
which
said
they
could
split
the
income
that
they
might
--
could
split
the
income.
if
this
court
were
to
say
that
as
a
naturals
result
of
that
decision
that
the
wife
must
split
the
income
and
report
one-half
and
pay
the
tax
on
it,
then
we
say
that
violates
the
fifth
amendment.
that
--
if
that
interpretation
of
section
1
of
the
code
would
make
section
1
unconstitutional.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
we
say
that
it
is
unconstitutional
to
tax
the
wife
on
one-half
of
the
community
income
and
we
do
not
think
that
it
compares
at
all
with
the
partnership
or
a
trust.
if
a
partner
absconds
with
the
partnership
money
presumably
there
is
a
theft
deduction.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
because
this
--
but
first
of
all,
this
court
has
said
it
could
tax
the
husband
but
this
court
has
said
over
and
over
again.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
it
did
not
say
that,
malcolm
does
not
say
that
your
honor.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
because
he
has
control,
he
has
the
possession
for
this
--
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
the
state
law
gives
him
the
power
to
take
her
income.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
but
we
can
get
into
a
--
what
he
can
do
is
practical
matter
as
a
legal
matter.
as
a
matter
of
right,
he
can
do
it
--
he
can
require
her
employer.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
we’re
talking
about
practical
powers
as
against
legal
power.
he
has
the
legal
power.
the
state
of
louisiana
gives
him.
it
vests
in
him
from
the
moment
of
marriage.
it
vests
in
him
the
power
to
take
control
of
that
money
and
take
it
from
her.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
this
court
has
said
that
at
least
in
the
case
of
oklahoma
that
you
cannot
achieve
these
results
because
it
would
be
an
assignment.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
if
i
may
sum
up
in
just
a
moment,
that
the
essence
of
our
argument
is,
is
that
the
only
reason
that
anyone
has
suggest
the
tax
in
the
husband
and
the
wife
is
that
the
community
is
an
entity
which
is
not
a
tax
paying
entity.
no
one
has
suggested
and
poe
v.
seaborn
does
not
say
or
none
of
the
cases
have
ever
considered
this
problem
except
from
the
tax
court
cases
have
said.
none
have
said
that
the
wife
owns
the
cash
in
bank,
what
they
have
said
is
she
has
a
vested
interest
in
this
conjugal
partnership
which
means
if
when
this
community
terminates,
she
gets
one-half
of
what
is
left.
nobody
has
suggested
that
she
owns
the
furniture
of
the
car
or
anything
else.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
right.
and
--
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
yes,
but
it
isn’t
--
we
are
not
talking
about
the
title
to
this
property.
this
property
has
now
fallen
into
the
community
and
the
community
owns
it
and
it
will
--
and
as
long
as
it
is
in
the
community
it
is
our
property.
community
property
could
had
the
title
in
the
wife’s
name
but
that
would
not
make
her
the
owner
of
it,
it
would
not
--
her
husband
could
require
that
it
be
transferred
from
her
to
someone
else.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
lawyers
of
our
state
are
so
used
to
dealing
with
the
community
is
not
--
we
do
not
need
to
reiterate
the
entity
theory
as
we
discuss
it.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
she
could
not
--
no,
she
could
not
sell
it.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
well,
as
one
rather
said
it
is
almost
necessary
to
be
born
and
bred
in
the
community
system
to
feel
its
new
onsets.
but
be
that
is
it
may,
it
is
a
fundamental
principle
of
community
property.
i
say
in
every
community
property
state
that
the
community
is
an
entity.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
we
agree
--
we
do
not
--
we
contend
that
she
does
not
owe
it.
there’s
no
contention
on
the
part
of
the
respondent
that
if
she
became
liable
for
a
taxes
or
for
anything
else
that
the
state
could
cause
her
to
escape
liability
from
it.
we
say
she
was
not
liable.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
she
ends
up
with
nothing.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
there’s
nothing
she
can
do
about
it.
if
a
trustee
took
her
property,
she
might
sue
that
trustee,
if
she
took
the
property
to
trustee,
she
might
sue
the
trustee
and
if
he
stole
it
and
she
couldn’t
recover,
she
can
probably
get
an
offset
on
income
tax
against
that
for
theft
laws.
the
thing
is
the
same
as
probably
true
of
the
partnership,
but
it
is
not
true
of
the
community.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
if
she
renounces
the
community,
then
the
community
is
after
her
under
state
law
as
if
it
had
never
existed.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
no.
if
she
--
if
this
court
meant
in
poe
v.
seaborn
that
this
was
a
separate
debt
of
hers
that
one-half
the
taxes
on
one-half
of
the
community’s
income
were
her
separate
debt.
if
that
what
this
court
meant
beyond
that
holding
being
and
we
say
an
unconstitutional
interpretations
of
section
1,
she
could
not
escape
it
under
our
law.
we
don’t
say
that
our
law
relieves
her
of
any
liability.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
no,
your
honor
she
would
never
become
liable
for
any
community
debt
unless
she
accepted
the
community.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
whether
renunciation
--
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
she
is
not
liable
from
at
the
point
of
inception
to
debt.
the
renunciation
is
the
point
at
which
puts
it
out
of
question
whether
she
will
or
will
not
assume
liability.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
then
she
--
well,
let
me
say
that
prior
to
the
20’s
she
had
30
days
in
which
it
was
presumed
if
she
did
not
renounce
in
30
days,
it
was
presumed
she
had
renounced.
under
this
law,
she
is
not
required
to
come
in
now
and
renounce.
if
she
takes
hold
of
the
community
and
takes
any
of
its
property
and
uses
it.
then
she
is
presumed
to
have
accepted
the
community
and
then
she
becomes
liable
for
its
debts,
but
if
she
renounces
at
that
point
it’s
put
out
of
question
that
she
--
that
is
a
statement
that
she
will
not
become
liable
for
its
debts.
but
if
she
has
a
separate
debt,
which
is
what
the
government
has
argued
that
she
has
a
debt,
if
she
can
--
you
understand
that
during
the
existence
of
community,
she
can
contact
debts
that
are
on
her
own
separate
debts
which
are
not
--
cannot
be
paid
out
of
the
community,
cannot
go
to
the
husband
and
ask
you
and
pay
them.
those
--
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
yes,
she
can
have
income
from
separate
paraphernalia
property
provided
that
she
had
reserved
that
income
to
herself.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
if
the
--
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
if
the
wife
has
been
that
the
result
of
putting
into
the
joint
--
well,
let
me
say
first
of
all
your
honor.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
under
our
conceptually
under
our
law
it
is
not,
it
is
the
husband’s
money,
but
the
banking
laws
are
amended
so
that
if
the
bank
honors
a
check
that
the
wife
has
drawn
then
she
will
be
treated
as
if
the
husband
had
authorized
her
to
draw
that
check.
but
conceptually,
that
is
not
a
joint
bank
account
if
the
husband
were
to
die,
she
would
find
out
that
she
would
not
be
able
take
anything
from
him
or
anything
that
would
terminate
the
community
like
that,
she
would
not
be
able
to
draw
from
that
account.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
acquets.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
yes
sir,
correct.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
you
see
--
your
honor,
under
our
law,
there
is
never
any
reason
to
ask
who
owns
the
community.
there
are
bundles
of
rights
and
we
don’t
find
it
necessary
to
characterize
something
as
ownership.
it
is
this
court
that
found
it
necessarily
characterized
something
as
ownership.
they
have
to
find
the
ownership
and
they
said
that
the
ownership
is
not
the
property
but
it
is
community.
it
is
the
interest
in
the
community.
they
found
her
interest
to
be
“vested”
meaning,
present.
meaning,
that
if
she
dies
it
will
go
to
her
heirs,
that
if
she
dies,
she
can
leave
a
will
and
it
will
pass
by
that
will
nothing
more.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
we
learned
to
talked
about
ownership,
your
honor
when
the
split
income
that
came
a
possibility.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
but
not
mrs.
mitchell.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
no.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
that’s
correct.
that’s
correct,
the
husband
and
the
wife
that
before
marriage
it
is
not
necessary
that
they
elect
to
come
out
of
the
community
property
system.
they
may
record
a
marriage
contract
in
the
public
records
which
eliminates
the
community
property
system
as
to
them.
but
once
they
come
under
that
system
if
the
wives
grant
a
renunciation
comes
about
only
at
the
termination
of
the
community.
that’s
the
debt
separation
been
barred,
divorced
and
that
action
for
separation
of
property.
at
this
point,
--
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
an
action
for
separation
of
property.
at
this
point,
she
either
--
she
has
three
choices.
she
will
say,
“i
will
take
the
community
with
benefit
of
inventory.”
meaning,
husband
clean
it
up,
pay
the
debts.
if
there’s
anything
left
over,
i
will
take
a
half
of
it,
i
will
take
half
of
it.
or
she
can
take
the
community,
she
can
accept
the
community
unconditionally
and
which
--
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
yes,
her
half
community.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
her
half
community.
in
other
words,
she
can
take
an
in
rem
out
of
these.
everything
is
in
rem
as
to
her
if
she
takes
it
with
benefit
of
inventory.
and
if
she
takes
the
community
with
benefit
of
inventory,
the
property
of
the
community
must
be
first
use
to
satisfy
the
debts
and
if
there
be
anything
left,
she
gets
one-half
of
that.
that’s
the
--
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
no.
at
the
termination
of
the
community
that
they
--
at
the
debt
of
the
husbands,
at
this
point
community
no
longer
exist.
the
wife
of
this
--
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
at
a
divorce
it
has
to
be
appointed
which
the
community
terminates
under
our
law.
but
if
we
reach
it
for
where
the
community
terminates
under
our
law
the
wife
has
the
choice.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
you’re
talking
about
the
joint
bank
account?
the
husband
made
to
invest
her
with
the
power,
the
power
to
act
with
community
property.
he
may
make
her
the
agent
of
the
community
in
which
case
she
may
have
the
powers,
but
when
she
has
that
agency
it
is
agent
for
the
community,
alone.
she
is
not
acting
as
on
her
own
right
nor
is
she
acting
as
agent
for
her
husband.
she
is
acting
as
agent
for
the
community.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
yes
your
honor
without
any
question.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
i
would
because
the
law
of
our
state
makes
that
a
property
under
the
control
of
her
husband.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
the
hardship
would
not
be
as
great,
but
as
far
as
the
legal
--
her
legal
rights,
her
legal
rights
are
just
as
great
--
i
mean
her
legal
disabilities
are
just
as
great
under
that
situation
as
under
any
of
that.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
through
whatever
step
it
takes,
he
can
take
it
away
from
her.
she
is
not
permitted
to
keep
that
money
as
her
own.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
they
would
terminate.
(laughs)
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
this
court
--
not
this
court,
the
revenue
department
says
she
is
the
owner
and
our
courts
have
attempted
to
characterize
her
as
such.
the
statute
of
california
which
it
took
to
make
--
to
turn
her
interests
from
an
expectancy
into
a
vested
ownership
was
no
more
than
adjective.
it
said,
“from
this
day
forward,
her
interest
will
be
vested.”
present
and
vested
whatever
that
meant.
it
is
upon
that
that
this
court
decided
in
malcolm.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
prior
to
that
statute,
this
court
had
found
as
it
had
used
the
characterization
of
the
supreme
court
of
california
that
the
wife’s
interest
was
a
mere
expectancy
because
she
had
no
rights
of
control.
following
the
amendment
of
the
california
statute
to
say
that
her
right
was
vested,
this
court
said
that
she
can
file
a
return
and
pay
one-half
on
it.
thank
you.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
court
has
said
that
individuals
who
have
command
over
income
may
be
taxed
on
that
income
even
though
they
do
not
have
title
to
it.
we
ask
this
court
to
hold
that
the
respondent
mrs.
anne
goyne
mitchell
that
it
cannot
be
taxed
on
income
--
community
income
which
she
just
said
she
owns
but
over
which
she
has
no
command.
we
ask
this
because
to
interpret
section
1
of
the
code
which
taxes
income
of
individuals.
as
imposing
a
tax
on
her
would
make
it
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
her
and
secondly,
irrespective
the
constitutional
argument.
and
the
issue
in
section
1,
section
1
should
not
be
interpreted
as
imposing
a
tax
on
her
because
her
vested
interest
in
the
community
is
insufficient
to
cause
her
to
be
required
and
the
treat
that
the
income
of
that
community
as
her
own
income.
under
louisiana
--
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
it
does
your
honor.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
i
have
never
been
able
to
find
any
record
of
it
having
occurred,
made
it
inquires
with
the
state
revenue
people.
i
find
to
more
instance.
it
does
not
mean
they
aren’t
or
not.
under
the
community
proper
regime
of
louisiana,
the
wife
has
no
present
rights
to
deal
with
the
community.
during
the
existence
of
the
community
she
cannot
sell
the
property.
she
cannot
more
of
its
property.
she
cannot
obligate
the
community
in
her
own
right.
she
cannot
compel
an
accounting
from
her
husband
or
she
cannot
require
him
to
furnish
any
information
to
her.
he
has
complete
control
of
the
property.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
it
has
been
a
law
of
louisiana,
your
honor,
at
least
since
it
became
a
state
and
prior
thereto
under
the
spanish
and
french.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
i
do
disagree.
there
is
one
instance
at
which
she
can’t
ask
for
a
separation
of
property.
the
only
time
during
the
existence
of
community
--
the
community
can
terminate
at
death
or
divorce
or
separation
or
if
at
one
point
she
may
ask
for
a
termination
of
the
community.
that
is
when
his
mismanagement
of
the
community
is
endangering
her
separate
property.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
in
this
particular
situation,
your
honor
she
had
no
separate
property
at
the
point
that,
which
she
might
have
ask
for
termination
of
the
community.
but,
--
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
our
courts
have
held
that
if
the
result
of
his
squandering
the
community
funds,
is
to
make
her
support
put
in
jeopardy
and
that
she
is
working
she
might
get
a
termination
of
the
community
so
that
her
future
earnings
would
be
her
separate
property.
that
is
not
the
situation
your
honor.
she
could
not
show
that
she
was
not
being
supported
during
the
continuation
of
this
community.
it
was
after
this
community
--
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
our
courts
have
not
at
this
point
interpreted
support
that
broadly.
i
can’t
say
what
they
would
interpret
us
for,
but
it
intends
to
be
what
it
takes
to
subsist
food,
clothing,
shelter,
etcetera.
the
wife
herself
--
our
courts
would
treat
the
wife
as
agent
of
the
husband
if
she
would
go
buy
food,
but
when
you
get
much
pass
that,
you
get
into
the
great
controversy
as
to
whether
that
is
supported
or
not
in
our
state.
the
wife
--
the
husband
has
complete
control
of
community.
he
may
sell
the
property,
he
may
spend
the
money
virtually
as
he
pleases
but
he
may
spend
the
money
as
he
pleases.
he
--
subject
to
certain
restrictions,
he
can
make
gifts
of
the
community
property
to
others.
he
is
not
a
fiduciary
and
he
is
not
required
to
account
his
wife
during
the
course
of
the
community
or
thereafter
for
his
administration.
the
restrictions
upon
him
are
that
he
can
not
donate
the
immovables
or
a
quota
such
as
one-fourth,
one-half
of
the
movables
to
anyone
other
than
the
children
of
the
marriage.
if
he
may
give
a
sum
of
money
which
is
not
--
it’s
not
described
as
one-fourth
of
all
our
personal
property
to
anyone
he
chooses.
he
may
not
sell
property
which
has
been
designated
as
the
family
homestead
without
the
wife
joining
in
the
deed.
he
cannot
take
the
community
property
and
steal
it
so
to
speak
and
make
it
his
separate
property
and
--
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
he
can
sell
it
as
he
chooses,
he
can
sell
it
--
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
he
does
not
need
her
signature
at
all.
he
may
--
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
he
would
have
--
he
could
have
property
which
he
owned
before
marriage,
he
could
have
property
which
was
the
result
having
sold
that
property
and
reinvested
it
gives
an
inheritance.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
i’m
attacking
by
an
interpretation
of
section
1
of
the
code
as
imposing
a
tax
on
the
wife
in
community,
when
she
has
not
assume
that
liability
by
filing
return
or
accepting
the
community.
the
husband
may
not
fraudulently
dispose
of
the
community
with
the
intent
to
the
prior
the
wife
albeit.
we
contend
your
--
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
without
any
control
whatsoever.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
that
is
correct.
we
contend
that
in
term
section
1
of
code
as
imposing
a
tax
on
the
wife
violates
the
dues
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
because
it
is
arbitrary
and
unreasonable
and
that
she
has
no
control
and
it
has
no
--
and
the
husband
at
the
same
time
has
power
to
deny
her
the
property.
if
she
is
required
to
report,
it
is
legally
impossible
for
her
to
do
so
unless
her
husband
--
she
can
only
do
so
unless
her
husband
gives
her
the
information.
if
she
does
not
have
separate
property
and
he
will
not
advance
the
funds,
it
is
impossible
for
her
to
pay.
whether
or
not
she
pays
are
of
course
depends
upon
his
whim
and
we
contend
that
to
pay
to
require
her
to
pay
community
taxes
with
her
separate
funds
is
to
confiscate
her
separate
property.
but
section
1
does
not
require.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
your
honor,
when
you’re
comparing
a
wife
in
a
separate
property
state
who
have
signed
a
joint
return
and
made
herself
liable
by
signing
the
joint
return
she
made
it
possible
for
the
family
to
split
the
income,
that
the
congress
makes
her
liable,
makes
her
agreed
to
be
liable
for
all
the
taxes
by
virtue
of
signing
the
return.
now,
the
question
whether
fraudulently
income
--
money
is
income
or
not
and
this
court
has
decided
twice
and
at
this
moment
it
is
income.
i
doubt
seriously
that
we
can
avoid
taxation
to
the
wife
in
louisiana
because
our
state
law
said,
that
embezzle
money
was
not
the
property
of
the
community.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
i
don’t
understand,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
she
would
not
be
liable
at
all
if
she
had
not
filed
a
return.
she
was
not
required
to
file
a
return
and
she
would
not
be
liable
under
any
circumstances
had
she
not
filed
a
return.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
right,
yes
she
is
and
just
as
hard
part
of
the
position,
but
the
government
says
here,
“you
must
file
return.
you
don’t
have
a
choice
of
whether
to
file
a
return
and
be
liable
or
not
file
return
and
not
be
liable.”
the
government
says,
“here,
you
must
file
a
return
and
be
liable.”
i
think,
that
this
is
a
greater
--
the
greater
problem.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
that’s
correct
and
it’s
our
contention
that
it
is
not
her
income
that
section
1
of
the
code
when
it
imposes
the
tax
on
the
income
of
individuals
does
not
impose
the
tax
on
the
wife.
now,
the
argument
goes
that
since
she
has
a
vested
interest
in
the
community,
she
owns
a
community’s
income,
but
this
ignores
a
basic
fundamental
concept
of
community
property
law.
the
community
is
in
an
entity.
community
property
is
not
a
form
of
co-ownership,
co-tenancy.
the
community
property
is
the
property
of
the
community.
it
is
not
owned
one-half
by
one
and
one-half
by
the
other.
community
property
is
the
community
is
separate
from
the
husband
and
the
wife.
the
problem
is,
the
tax
problem
arises
from
the
fact
that
the
community
is
not
a
tax
paying
entity
and
--
or
define
an
individual
or
individuals
who
will
pay
its
tax,
the
community’s
income
must
be
attributed
to
some
person.
the
question
then
it
really
and
truly
is
not
whose
income
is
it,
but
to
whom
should
it
be
attributed
now,
poe
v.
seaborn,
did
not,
which
held
that
the
husband
and
wife
in
split
income
was
not
based
upon
the
concept
that
the
husband
and
the
wife
own
the
income.
it
was
based
upon
the
rational
that
neither
owned
it
and
sets
one
--
the
case
said,
that
the
opinion
said
that
it
could
not
be
said
that
one
owned
it
more
--
any
more
than
the
other.
and
as
a
result,
they
were
permitted
to
split
the
income,
but
that
is
not
the
same
thing
it
saying
that
one
owns
the
income
or
the
other
or
both
own
it.
mitchell
says,
that
seaborn
permitted
both
to
file
returns
and
split
the
income
that
this
is
a
--
that
the
whole
rational
of
seaborn
if
they
did
not
and
if
we
do
not
look
--
mitchell
said,
that
if
the
husband
and
wife
do
not
split
the
income
and
file
returns,
they
say,
if
they
do
the
wife
has
assumed
the
liability
by
virtue
of
filing
the
return
that
return.
why?
because
seaborn
said,
she
could
file
the
return.
but
if
they
did
not
split
the
income
and
file
returns
that
the
court
should
then
look
to
see
to
whom
should
the
income
be
attributed.
the
fifth
circuit
said,
“the
income
should
be
attributed
to
the
husband
because
he
had
control
of
the
property
and
because
to
treat
it
any
other
way
was
to
reap
up
the
community
property
law
unnecessarily
by
the
use
of
the
tax
law.”
it
said,
“the
husband
was
liable
for
the
debts
of
the
community,
that
this
was
by
its
nature
a
community
debt
and
the
husband
was
the
logical
person
to
pay
the
tax.”
mitchell
does
not
conflict
with
seaborn
unless,
that
the
import
of
seaborn
laws
that
the
husband
could
only
be
required
to
pay
on
one-half
or
that
the
wife
was
liable
for
one-half
of
the
tax
on
her
separate
property
without
regard
to
anything
else.
if
that
is
what
seaborn
meant
although
it
did
not
say
that,
we
suggest
that
this
court
should
overrule
seaborn
because
that
is
an
illogical
interpretation
of
section
1.
it
creates
an
unnecessary
problem
with
state
law
and
it
causes
the
collection
problems
that
the
government
complains
of
here.
it
is
unnecessary
for
this
court
to
overrule
seaborn,
to
affirm
mitchell.
but
if
this
--
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
seaborn
held
that
the
husband
and
wife
in
the
community
property
states
could
file
separate
returns
and
return
one-half
income
on
each.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
that
the
rational
of
seaborn
as
i
read
it
or
it
was
based
upon
two
rationales.
one
that
the
revenue
service
had
permitted
it
in
its
regulations
and
that
the
income
tax
law
had
been
reenacted
in
the
interim,
and
therefore
that
they
would
accept
administrative
construction.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
seaborn
was
ruling
on
washington
law
but
after
that
case,
it
was
quickly
followed
by
california,
arizona,
louisiana
and
texas
cases.
basically,
relying
on
seaborn.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
that
the
court
was
wrong
in
its
characterization
of
washington
community
property
law.
the
court
acknowledge
that
the
community
was
in
entity
and
--
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
your
honor?
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
that
the
ruling
was
on
the
state
law
that
the
court
found
that
the
wife
have
a
vested
interest
in
the
community.
that
is
the
entity
and
that
as
such
she
was
entitled
to
report
one-half
of
the
community
the
entity’s
income
as
her
own.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
whether
or
not
that
the
congress
has
the
power
to
require
state
to
adopt
other
than
the
community
property
system,
i
don’t
know.
but
i
do
contend
that
congress
--
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
well,
i
would
not
think
they
would,
but
i
do
not
think
if
congress
could
tax
--
if
congress
could
tax
the
income
of
the
community
to
one
or
the
other
of
the
husband
or
wife.
we
would
acknowledge
that
congress
can
tax
to
the
husband.
united
states
v.
robbins
said
that
it
could.
but
we
would
contend
that
they
cannot
tax
it
to
the
wife.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
i
say
that
if
this
court
does
say
that
seaborn
which
said
they
could
split
the
income
that
they
might
--
could
split
the
income.
if
this
court
were
to
say
that
as
a
naturals
result
of
that
decision
that
the
wife
must
split
the
income
and
report
one-half
and
pay
the
tax
on
it,
then
we
say
that
violates
the
fifth
amendment.
that
--
if
that
interpretation
of
section
1
of
the
code
would
make
section
1
unconstitutional.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
we
say
that
it
is
unconstitutional
to
tax
the
wife
on
one-half
of
the
community
income
and
we
do
not
think
that
it
compares
at
all
with
the
partnership
or
a
trust.
if
a
partner
absconds
with
the
partnership
money
presumably
there
is
a
theft
deduction.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
because
this
--
but
first
of
all,
this
court
has
said
it
could
tax
the
husband
but
this
court
has
said
over
and
over
again.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
it
did
not
say
that,
malcolm
does
not
say
that
your
honor.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
because
he
has
control,
he
has
the
possession
for
this
--
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
the
state
law
gives
him
the
power
to
take
her
income.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
but
we
can
get
into
a
--
what
he
can
do
is
practical
matter
as
a
legal
matter.
as
a
matter
of
right,
he
can
do
it
--
he
can
require
her
employer.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
we’re
talking
about
practical
powers
as
against
legal
power.
he
has
the
legal
power.
the
state
of
louisiana
gives
him.
it
vests
in
him
from
the
moment
of
marriage.
it
vests
in
him
the
power
to
take
control
of
that
money
and
take
it
from
her.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
this
court
has
said
that
at
least
in
the
case
of
oklahoma
that
you
cannot
achieve
these
results
because
it
would
be
an
assignment.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
if
i
may
sum
up
in
just
a
moment,
that
the
essence
of
our
argument
is,
is
that
the
only
reason
that
anyone
has
suggest
the
tax
in
the
husband
and
the
wife
is
that
the
community
is
an
entity
which
is
not
a
tax
paying
entity.
no
one
has
suggested
and
poe
v.
seaborn
does
not
say
or
none
of
the
cases
have
ever
considered
this
problem
except
from
the
tax
court
cases
have
said.
none
have
said
that
the
wife
owns
the
cash
in
bank,
what
they
have
said
is
she
has
a
vested
interest
in
this
conjugal
partnership
which
means
if
when
this
community
terminates,
she
gets
one-half
of
what
is
left.
nobody
has
suggested
that
she
owns
the
furniture
of
the
car
or
anything
else.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
right.
and
--
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
yes,
but
it
isn’t
--
we
are
not
talking
about
the
title
to
this
property.
this
property
has
now
fallen
into
the
community
and
the
community
owns
it
and
it
will
--
and
as
long
as
it
is
in
the
community
it
is
our
property.
community
property
could
had
the
title
in
the
wife’s
name
but
that
would
not
make
her
the
owner
of
it,
it
would
not
--
her
husband
could
require
that
it
be
transferred
from
her
to
someone
else.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
lawyers
of
our
state
are
so
used
to
dealing
with
the
community
is
not
--
we
do
not
need
to
reiterate
the
entity
theory
as
we
discuss
it.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
she
could
not
--
no,
she
could
not
sell
it.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
well,
as
one
rather
said
it
is
almost
necessary
to
be
born
and
bred
in
the
community
system
to
feel
its
new
onsets.
but
be
that
is
it
may,
it
is
a
fundamental
principle
of
community
property.
i
say
in
every
community
property
state
that
the
community
is
an
entity.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
we
agree
--
we
do
not
--
we
contend
that
she
does
not
owe
it.
there’s
no
contention
on
the
part
of
the
respondent
that
if
she
became
liable
for
a
taxes
or
for
anything
else
that
the
state
could
cause
her
to
escape
liability
from
it.
we
say
she
was
not
liable.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
she
ends
up
with
nothing.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
there’s
nothing
she
can
do
about
it.
if
a
trustee
took
her
property,
she
might
sue
that
trustee,
if
she
took
the
property
to
trustee,
she
might
sue
the
trustee
and
if
he
stole
it
and
she
couldn’t
recover,
she
can
probably
get
an
offset
on
income
tax
against
that
for
theft
laws.
the
thing
is
the
same
as
probably
true
of
the
partnership,
but
it
is
not
true
of
the
community.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
if
she
renounces
the
community,
then
the
community
is
after
her
under
state
law
as
if
it
had
never
existed.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
no.
if
she
--
if
this
court
meant
in
poe
v.
seaborn
that
this
was
a
separate
debt
of
hers
that
one-half
the
taxes
on
one-half
of
the
community’s
income
were
her
separate
debt.
if
that
what
this
court
meant
beyond
that
holding
being
and
we
say
an
unconstitutional
interpretations
of
section
1,
she
could
not
escape
it
under
our
law.
we
don’t
say
that
our
law
relieves
her
of
any
liability.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
no,
your
honor
she
would
never
become
liable
for
any
community
debt
unless
she
accepted
the
community.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
whether
renunciation
--
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
she
is
not
liable
from
at
the
point
of
inception
to
debt.
the
renunciation
is
the
point
at
which
puts
it
out
of
question
whether
she
will
or
will
not
assume
liability.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
then
she
--
well,
let
me
say
that
prior
to
the
20’s
she
had
30
days
in
which
it
was
presumed
if
she
did
not
renounce
in
30
days,
it
was
presumed
she
had
renounced.
under
this
law,
she
is
not
required
to
come
in
now
and
renounce.
if
she
takes
hold
of
the
community
and
takes
any
of
its
property
and
uses
it.
then
she
is
presumed
to
have
accepted
the
community
and
then
she
becomes
liable
for
its
debts,
but
if
she
renounces
at
that
point
it’s
put
out
of
question
that
she
--
that
is
a
statement
that
she
will
not
become
liable
for
its
debts.
but
if
she
has
a
separate
debt,
which
is
what
the
government
has
argued
that
she
has
a
debt,
if
she
can
--
you
understand
that
during
the
existence
of
community,
she
can
contact
debts
that
are
on
her
own
separate
debts
which
are
not
--
cannot
be
paid
out
of
the
community,
cannot
go
to
the
husband
and
ask
you
and
pay
them.
those
--
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
yes,
she
can
have
income
from
separate
paraphernalia
property
provided
that
she
had
reserved
that
income
to
herself.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
if
the
--
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
if
the
wife
has
been
that
the
result
of
putting
into
the
joint
--
well,
let
me
say
first
of
all
your
honor.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
under
our
conceptually
under
our
law
it
is
not,
it
is
the
husband’s
money,
but
the
banking
laws
are
amended
so
that
if
the
bank
honors
a
check
that
the
wife
has
drawn
then
she
will
be
treated
as
if
the
husband
had
authorized
her
to
draw
that
check.
but
conceptually,
that
is
not
a
joint
bank
account
if
the
husband
were
to
die,
she
would
find
out
that
she
would
not
be
able
take
anything
from
him
or
anything
that
would
terminate
the
community
like
that,
she
would
not
be
able
to
draw
from
that
account.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
acquets.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
yes
sir,
correct.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
you
see
--
your
honor,
under
our
law,
there
is
never
any
reason
to
ask
who
owns
the
community.
there
are
bundles
of
rights
and
we
don’t
find
it
necessary
to
characterize
something
as
ownership.
it
is
this
court
that
found
it
necessarily
characterized
something
as
ownership.
they
have
to
find
the
ownership
and
they
said
that
the
ownership
is
not
the
property
but
it
is
community.
it
is
the
interest
in
the
community.
they
found
her
interest
to
be
“vested”
meaning,
present.
meaning,
that
if
she
dies
it
will
go
to
her
heirs,
that
if
she
dies,
she
can
leave
a
will
and
it
will
pass
by
that
will
nothing
more.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
we
learned
to
talked
about
ownership,
your
honor
when
the
split
income
that
came
a
possibility.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
but
not
mrs.
mitchell.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
no.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
that’s
correct.
that’s
correct,
the
husband
and
the
wife
that
before
marriage
it
is
not
necessary
that
they
elect
to
come
out
of
the
community
property
system.
they
may
record
a
marriage
contract
in
the
public
records
which
eliminates
the
community
property
system
as
to
them.
but
once
they
come
under
that
system
if
the
wives
grant
a
renunciation
comes
about
only
at
the
termination
of
the
community.
that’s
the
debt
separation
been
barred,
divorced
and
that
action
for
separation
of
property.
at
this
point,
--
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
an
action
for
separation
of
property.
at
this
point,
she
either
--
she
has
three
choices.
she
will
say,
“i
will
take
the
community
with
benefit
of
inventory.”
meaning,
husband
clean
it
up,
pay
the
debts.
if
there’s
anything
left
over,
i
will
take
a
half
of
it,
i
will
take
half
of
it.
or
she
can
take
the
community,
she
can
accept
the
community
unconditionally
and
which
--
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
yes,
her
half
community.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
her
half
community.
in
other
words,
she
can
take
an
in
rem
out
of
these.
everything
is
in
rem
as
to
her
if
she
takes
it
with
benefit
of
inventory.
and
if
she
takes
the
community
with
benefit
of
inventory,
the
property
of
the
community
must
be
first
use
to
satisfy
the
debts
and
if
there
be
anything
left,
she
gets
one-half
of
that.
that’s
the
--
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
no.
at
the
termination
of
the
community
that
they
--
at
the
debt
of
the
husbands,
at
this
point
community
no
longer
exist.
the
wife
of
this
--
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
at
a
divorce
it
has
to
be
appointed
which
the
community
terminates
under
our
law.
but
if
we
reach
it
for
where
the
community
terminates
under
our
law
the
wife
has
the
choice.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
you’re
talking
about
the
joint
bank
account?
the
husband
made
to
invest
her
with
the
power,
the
power
to
act
with
community
property.
he
may
make
her
the
agent
of
the
community
in
which
case
she
may
have
the
powers,
but
when
she
has
that
agency
it
is
agent
for
the
community,
alone.
she
is
not
acting
as
on
her
own
right
nor
is
she
acting
as
agent
for
her
husband.
she
is
acting
as
agent
for
the
community.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
yes
your
honor
without
any
question.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
i
would
because
the
law
of
our
state
makes
that
a
property
under
the
control
of
her
husband.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
the
hardship
would
not
be
as
great,
but
as
far
as
the
legal
--
her
legal
rights,
her
legal
rights
are
just
as
great
--
i
mean
her
legal
disabilities
are
just
as
great
under
that
situation
as
under
any
of
that.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
through
whatever
step
it
takes,
he
can
take
it
away
from
her.
she
is
not
permitted
to
keep
that
money
as
her
own.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
they
would
terminate.
(laughs)
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
this
court
--
not
this
court,
the
revenue
department
says
she
is
the
owner
and
our
courts
have
attempted
to
characterize
her
as
such.
the
statute
of
california
which
it
took
to
make
--
to
turn
her
interests
from
an
expectancy
into
a
vested
ownership
was
no
more
than
adjective.
it
said,
“from
this
day
forward,
her
interest
will
be
vested.”
present
and
vested
whatever
that
meant.
it
is
upon
that
that
this
court
decided
in
malcolm.
mr.
paul
k.
kirkpatrick,
jr.
prior
to
that
statute,
this
court
had
found
as
it
had
used
the
characterization
of
the
supreme
court
of
california
that
the
wife’s
interest
was
a
mere
expectancy
because
she
had
no
rights
of
control.
following
the
amendment
of
the
california
statute
to
say
that
her
right
was
vested,
this
court
said
that
she
can
file
a
return
and
pay
one-half
on
it.
thank
you.
