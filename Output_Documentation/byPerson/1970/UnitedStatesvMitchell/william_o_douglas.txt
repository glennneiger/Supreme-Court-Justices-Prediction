could
you
tell
me
one
detail,
is
the
income
of
the
community
on
which
the
deficiency
was
determined
due
to
the
wife’s
earnings
or
income
from
her
property
at
all?
justice
william
o.
douglas
this
has
to
be
your
position
necessarily.
it’s
rather
reminiscent
to
the
old
embezzlement
cases,
isn’t
it?

is
that
renunciation
louisiana
provision
common
to
all
community
properties?

william
o.
douglas
by
termination
of
the

this
would
include
death
of
the
