it
is
also
for
that
same
theory
that
there’s
no
way
the
rank
could
compel
the
“master”
to
pay?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn’t
that
a
part
of
a
theory?
justice
thurgood
marshall
still
i
have
great
difficulty
mr.
bray
with
the
“master”
not
telling
to
wife
anything
in
doling
out
a
weekly
allowance
to
him
and
you
charged
him
with
possessing
something.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
how
is
she
the
owner?
justice
thurgood
marshall
ownership
has
the
right
to
dispose.
justice
thurgood
marshall
bear
ownership
on
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
will
you
give
me
a
hypothetical
thing,
is
there
any
instance
you
know
in
the
tax
law
where
somebody’s
tax
or
some
of
the
--
he
never
knew
he
had?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
are
so.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
what
i
thought.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
right
and
the
partner
who
made
the
picks
up
a
little
money
long
since
that
what
he’s
going
to
pay.
justice
thurgood
marshall
presume
that
the
communities
in
existence
don’t
have
any
personal
property
of
his
own?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
attacking
the
constitutionality
of
the
entire
system?
justice
thurgood

mr.
kirkpatrick,
if
a
genuine
resident
adopts
louisiana
law,
do
you
mean
that

automatically
make
me
the
boss
of
all
my
money?
justice
thurgood

(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
she
couldn’t
sell,
could
she?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
part
of
title
is
the
right
to
self
so
i
guess
it’s
really
confusing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
about
government’s
argument
that
the
state
does
not
have
the
power
or
authority
to
by

set
up
a
community
problem
anything
else
to
arrange
that
somebody
who
owe
something
not
paying
taxes
on
it?
justice
thurgood

the
--
under

off
with
everything
then
she
has
nothing,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
there’s
nothing
she
can
do
about
it?
justice
thurgood

what
happens
if
all
of
the
community
property
is
in
a
joint
bank
account
under
louisiana
law?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
can
be
ownership,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
thurgood

money?
justice
